87,00:05:57.17,00:05:57.17,vote. And one person from each tribe

115,00:07:15.54,00:07:15.54,"before, you know, we got to know each other or whatever."
116,00:07:19.58,00:07:19.58,But I bet one of the youngest ones drops out first.
117,00:07:23.08,00:07:23.08,We'll see who can handle the heat.

152,00:09:04.83,00:09:04.83,immediately. This wasn't even close.
153,00:09:07.12,00:09:07.12,"Smiles is not what I'd be doing. I'd be thinking about, how do I"
154,00:09:10.33,00:09:10.33,start working to change an impression that I have given
155,00:09:12.71,00:09:12.71,these guys? You guys have a long journey
156,00:09:15.12,00:09:15.12,ahead of you. You need to get to camp.
157,00:09:17.38,00:09:17.38,You need to start working on shelter.
158,00:09:19.67,00:09:19.67,>> All right. >> Let's take some.

160,00:09:28.92,00:09:28.92,have some work to do if you want to stay in this game.
161,00:09:31.54,00:09:31.54,Bird's coming in. Head on over.
162,00:09:34.08,00:09:34.08,Have a good flight. (grunts)
163,00:09:37.17,00:09:37.17,>> Yoo-ha! (bird screeching)
164,00:09:50.08,00:09:50.08,>> Has anybody ever wanted to come to Brazil?
165,00:09:52.12,00:09:52.12,">> Yes! >> Yeah, definitely."
166,00:09:54.21,00:09:54.21,">> This thing is getting heavy. >> Hey, you guys, hold up."
167,00:09:58.21,00:09:58.21,Wait for us! >> My partial motivation for
168,00:10:00.92,00:10:00.92,being here is to get rid of the rest of the my baby weight.
169,00:10:03.79,00:10:03.79,>> I like it. >> I got you. I got you.
170,00:10:06.08,00:10:06.08,>> I'm gonna melt it off in this damn heat.

172,00:10:10.25,00:10:10.25,"As far as I know, I'm the youngest contestant ever on"
173,00:10:12.71,00:10:12.71,Survivor. And I am obsessed with it.
174,00:10:15.42,00:10:15.42,I have watched every season. And I love the physical aspect.
175,00:10:17.75,00:10:17.75,I like the challenges. But the trek was treacherous.
176,00:10:19.79,00:10:19.79,It-It was hot. The sun was high.
177,00:10:21.67,00:10:21.67,"It was not easy, by any means. >> Are we going the right way,"
178,00:10:24.29,00:10:24.29,Joe? >> Is this way okay?
179,00:10:26.21,00:10:26.21,">> Uh, hold up, J.T. Hold on. Let's just make sure we're going"
180,00:10:29.12,00:10:29.12,the right way. Are you all cool with that?
181,00:10:31.04,00:10:31.04,">> Okay. >> You know how to read that,"
182,00:10:33.21,00:10:33.21,right? >> Remember the compass always
183,00:10:35.08,00:10:35.08,faced north. >> Compass 101.
184,00:10:36.71,00:10:36.71,>> You want to put the compass...
185,00:10:38.75,00:10:38.75,">> Yeah, so it faces north. >> ...down with the map so it"
186,00:10:41.17,00:10:41.17,"faces north. >> Well, we can't do that,"
187,00:10:43.00,00:10:43.00,'cause it's always going to face that way.
188,00:10:44.79,00:10:44.79,>> Okay. >> Uh-oh.
189,00:10:46.42,00:10:46.42,>> Turn that map like that. >> We're trading places.

191,00:10:50.08,00:10:50.08,">> I'm J.T., I'm 24 years old, and I'm from Samson, Alabama."
192,00:10:52.46,00:10:52.46,I manage a Black Angus cattle ranch.

196,00:11:03.25,00:11:03.25,">> I mean, it's right... literally right at the notch."
197,00:11:05.04,00:11:05.04,>> I know I'm going to be good at catching fish.
198,00:11:06.96,00:11:06.96,"And I know I'm going to be good at providing, but that'll also"
199,00:11:09.46,00:11:09.46,put me out in front of everybody else as a threat eventually.
200,00:11:12.38,00:11:12.38,The biggest challenge for me is going to be fitting in with the
201,00:11:15.92,00:11:15.92,people. >> What happened to your leg?
202,00:11:17.42,00:11:17.42,">> No, just from the water... >> Yeah, you have a hole in your"
203,00:11:19.25,00:11:19.25,"pants. >> Oh, yeah, my ass is ripped."
204,00:11:21.46,00:11:21.46,>> Got some booty hanging out on the first day.
205,00:11:24.08,00:11:24.08,">> You know, this is going to be nice for the ladies back home."
206,00:11:26.67,00:11:26.67,"When I saw at least one, sort of good, old-fashioned Southern"
207,00:11:30.21,00:11:30.21,"boy, I thought I'm a little bit screwed."
208,00:11:33.25,00:11:33.25,Don't really see us connecting on too many levels.
209,00:11:36.04,00:11:36.04,I don't know how much he's going to like the anxious New York

211,00:11:41.00,00:11:41.00,"going to be farther. So, if we're veering to the"
212,00:11:43.08,00:11:43.08,"left, we're cutting the whole corner off."
213,00:11:44.92,00:11:44.92,>> It's a good point. >> Yeah. Fair enough?
214,00:11:46.92,00:11:46.92,>> I'm not trying to be bossy or anything.
215,00:11:48.88,00:11:48.88,">> No, I like it. If it gets us there sooner,"
216,00:11:50.67,00:11:50.67,do it. >> If it gets us to Sandy
217,00:11:52.96,00:11:52.96,"sooner, I am all for that. >> To Sandy."
218,00:11:55.83,00:11:55.83,>> Sandy. >> Psycho Sandy.
219,00:11:57.62,00:11:57.62,">> Perfect. >> Yeah, follow J.T."
220,00:12:00.29,00:12:00.29,">> Just kind of keep me lined up, Joe."
221,00:12:02.71,00:12:02.71,>> Yeah. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
222,00:12:08.71,00:12:08.71,">> Come on, guys. We can do it."
223,00:12:17.46,00:12:17.46,>> This is hard. >> Yeah.
224,00:12:21.88,00:12:21.88,What the hell am I doing out here?
225,00:12:24.08,00:12:24.08,"I'm a hairstylist. The last time I went camping, I"
226,00:12:26.75,00:12:26.75,was maybe in the seventh grade. (screams)
227,00:12:29.96,00:12:29.96,">> Sorry, sorry. >> Are you okay?"
228,00:12:32.33,00:12:32.33,>> (laughing): Yeah. >> Break time?
229,00:12:36.54,00:12:36.54,">> We had a mishap. >> Dude, what else do you do to"
230,00:12:40.04,00:12:40.04,"stay in shape? >> Eat potato chips, watch TV."
231,00:12:42.25,00:12:42.25,"(laughing) >> No, seriously."
232,00:12:44.88,00:12:44.88,You gotta do something else. >> I work out.
233,00:12:46.71,00:12:46.71,I go to the gym. >> Yeah?
234,00:12:48.25,00:12:48.25,">> Yeah, I go to a gym. I just got back from Afghanistan"
235,00:12:50.08,00:12:50.08,on a 12-month tour. I'm with the South Carolina
236,00:12:52.12,00:12:52.12,Army National Guard. And I am a first sergeant.
237,00:12:55.71,00:12:55.71,I have 100 men under me. I stay pretty active.
238,00:12:58.71,00:12:58.71,"And I know how to give orders. But in Survivor, everybody has"
239,00:13:02.38,00:13:02.38,"their own individual mind, so I'm going to try to keep it"
240,00:13:05.17,00:13:05.17,low-key as I can because I don't want to be in charge.
241,00:13:09.21,00:13:09.21,"If you're in charge, you don't last too long."
242,00:13:11.04,00:13:11.04,>> Here's where we started. >> Head 91 degrees east.
243,00:13:13.67,00:13:13.67,>> And we have to go all the way until we find...
244,00:13:16.08,00:13:16.08,>> All the way until we find a palm tree.
245,00:13:18.12,00:13:18.12,>> I consider myself a Renaissance man/adventurer.
246,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,"I'm a university head soccer coach, and the polar opposite of"
247,00:13:25.17,00:13:25.17,that is that I'm the conductor and artistic director of a
248,00:13:28.79,00:13:28.79,"symphony in Northern California. We're going to go there, stop,"
249,00:13:31.04,00:13:31.04,"look at the compass, look at the map again."
250,00:13:33.21,00:13:33.21,"I'm always used to being a leader, by inspiring, pulling"
251,00:13:36.54,00:13:36.54,"out the best in everybody because as we all know, a team"
252,00:13:39.25,00:13:39.25,is only as good as its weakest player.
253,00:13:41.79,00:13:41.79,I want to tell you something. I want to change this game.
254,00:13:44.08,00:13:44.08,It's survival of the weakest. It's survival of the people that
255,00:13:49.67,00:13:49.67,"can't survive in the wild, and you and I can change this game"
256,00:13:52.25,00:13:52.25,by making the strong survive. If we look back at our
257,00:13:55.46,00:13:55.46,"ancestors, whether it be American Indian, whether it be"
258,00:13:58.25,00:13:58.25,"the Norse Vikings, whether it be the samurai warrior, they prayed"
259,00:14:01.75,00:14:01.75,"for an opponent that was worthy enough to defeat them, and died"
260,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,with honor and glory in the battle.
261,00:14:09.12,00:14:09.12,"So, I know I'm making myself honorable to you by letting it"
262,00:14:11.71,00:14:11.71,that out of the bag first. But that's what I'm talking
263,00:14:14.04,00:14:14.04,about... you and me change the game.
264,00:14:16.08,00:14:16.08,">> Coach, like right away, he came in and said, ""I want to"
265,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,"tell you how I'm playing this game."""
266,00:14:20.96,00:14:20.96,"But it kind of throws up a red flag being, one, is he lying,"
267,00:14:23.38,00:14:23.38,"and two, we're here to play and to win a game, and I don't think"
268,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,any of us wants a coach in that process.
269,00:14:30.96,00:14:30.96,">> Iron sharpens iron, baby. Say, let's rock 'n' roll, okay."
270,00:14:33.75,00:14:33.75,">> All right, let's go. >> Let's rock 'n' roll."

273,00:14:52.54,00:14:52.54,"but I couldn't take it all in because I was still pissed,"
274,00:14:55.17,00:14:55.17,because the first thing they want to do is get rid of the-the
275,00:14:58.00,00:14:58.00,"old gal. Oh, wow."
276,00:15:05.54,00:15:05.54,"I'm glad I'm here first. And then they can't see me, uh,"
277,00:15:09.54,00:15:09.54,with the emotion of the first vote.
278,00:15:14.12,00:15:14.12,It scared me so bad. But now I'm-I'm gonna...
279,00:15:19.54,00:15:19.54,I'm gonna make it to 39 days. I'm going to show 'em.
280,00:15:23.54,00:15:23.54,"Because maybe I am the older woman, but I'm older and I'm"
281,00:15:28.12,00:15:28.12,wiser. And this game is mine.
282,00:15:31.96,00:15:31.96,That's what I believe with all my heart.
283,00:15:34.54,00:15:34.54,So let the games begin. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

289,00:16:06.12,00:16:06.12,your tribe arrives. You can start setting up your

300,00:16:45.62,00:16:45.62,"I'm going to the beach, and I'm going to go find my idol."
301,00:16:48.54,00:16:48.54,"Oh, my God! When I first got here and I"
302,00:16:51.33,00:16:51.33,"seen, you know, the supplies or whatever, some wood laying there"
303,00:16:55.17,00:16:55.17,"and-and stuff and rope, I thought I can go back there and"
304,00:16:58.08,00:16:58.08,"try to make up this camp, you know, that they probably won't"
305,00:17:00.88,00:17:00.88,even like anyway because it's... a woman made it.
306,00:17:03.46,00:17:03.46,And it still ain't going to keep my name off that piece of paper.
307,00:17:06.38,00:17:06.38,So I'm going to look for the idol.
308,00:17:08.92,00:17:08.92,"And that's the bottom line, 'cause you gotta look out for"
309,00:17:11.25,00:17:11.25,"#1, and that's me. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"

374,00:21:10.96,00:21:10.96,">> So you guys, all I want to say is I was kind of really sick"
375,00:21:14.08,00:21:14.08,and I was hiding it because I thought it was a weakness.
376,00:21:17.25,00:21:17.25,"Yeah, I probably would've voted for myself not knowing what was"
377,00:21:19.83,00:21:19.83,wrong with me because I did look like I was tired.
378,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,>> But you couldn't have done what we did today.
379,00:21:24.21,00:21:24.21,>> I couldn't because I have a fever.
380,00:21:26.25,00:21:26.25,">> Sierra, she's a great, sweet kid."
381,00:21:28.04,00:21:28.04,"She's got a sweet spirit. She did do a lot of work and,"
382,00:21:30.71,00:21:30.71,"of course, we appreciate that. >> Did it change anything when"
383,00:21:32.50,00:21:32.50,you found out that I was sick? Did it make sense?
384,00:21:34.29,00:21:34.29,">> Yeah, yeah, no, it did. Yeah, it made a big difference."
385,00:21:38.08,00:21:38.08,">> But, you know, let's face it: you can't change what we did"
386,00:21:41.46,00:21:41.46,"together as a tribe. It bonded all of us, and,"
387,00:21:44.67,00:21:44.67,"unfortunately, you know, Sierra was not there, and obviously,"
388,00:21:47.25,00:21:47.25,I'm pushing for the strong to survive.
389,00:21:49.29,00:21:49.29,"So, I think Sierra, even though she's awesome, she's got to go."

392,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,">> Lay these posts on the ground and then lay these crossways,"
393,00:22:11.21,00:22:11.21,and you're still that far off the ground.
394,00:22:13.08,00:22:13.08,>> There you go. >> Things at camp are shaping up
395,00:22:15.29,00:22:15.29,okay. We've got our shelter built now.
396,00:22:17.38,00:22:17.38,"We haven't got our floor done, but it's gonna get better."
397,00:22:19.71,00:22:19.71,We're going to work on it a little more.
398,00:22:22.08,00:22:22.08,">> You need to get this one back up there, and the good thing"
399,00:22:24.62,00:22:24.62,"about it is, we'll have extra left so we can, like, either"
400,00:22:27.21,00:22:27.21,"make a chair or put, like, a wall up."
401,00:22:29.54,00:22:29.54,>> Do you think that's going to be worth it?
402,00:22:31.71,00:22:31.71,>> I don't know. I'm... >> It's going to take us all
403,00:22:33.83,00:22:33.83,day. >> That's a lot of work.
404,00:22:35.67,00:22:35.67,I don't know if I want to start that right now.
405,00:22:38.25,00:22:38.25,>> Let's try to get everything done as soon as possible and
406,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,then relax. It's hard for me to keep my
407,00:22:43.58,00:22:43.58,"opinions to myself, but I'm hoping that my tribe really"
408,00:22:47.75,00:22:47.75,understands that shelter is extremely important and that we
409,00:22:51.29,00:22:51.29,buckle down and get that going. >> So what I'm going to do-- I'm
410,00:22:55.83,00:22:55.83,"going to go use the restroom, and then I'm going to take up"
411,00:22:58.46,00:22:58.46,anything I think we might need. I don't know.
412,00:23:00.62,00:23:00.62,Is that cool? >> Yeah.
413,00:23:02.21,00:23:02.21,">> That's totally cool. >> All right, so I'm going to"
414,00:23:04.50,00:23:04.50,mosey on down this 'a way. >> All right.
415,00:23:06.79,00:23:06.79,">> Okay, I bought myself a few minutes, and I'm going over here"
416,00:23:10.46,00:23:10.46,to the beach to see if I can't find that idol again.
417,00:23:25.08,00:23:25.08,"Okay, I'm looking for the idol here because this was the stick"
418,00:23:28.71,00:23:28.71,that marks the spot. I hope and pray.
419,00:23:32.38,00:23:32.38,(panting) Oh.
420,00:23:37.21,00:23:37.21,"(whimpers) Oh, my God."
421,00:23:39.62,00:23:39.62,"Oh, God! Ooh!"
422,00:23:45.62,00:23:45.62,"Okay. ""Ten paces you'll walk towards"
423,00:23:49.92,00:23:49.92,"the lone palm tree. Dig in the sand, the next clue"
424,00:23:53.04,00:23:53.04,"you will see."" Ten paces?"
425,00:23:55.33,00:23:55.33,"Ten. I wonder what a pace is. All right, pace gods, give me a"
426,00:23:59.79,00:23:59.79,clue of how many paces. I don't know.
427,00:24:02.08,00:24:02.08,What's a pace? >> She went looking for stuff.
428,00:24:09.08,00:24:09.08,">> Oh, okay. >> By herself?"
429,00:24:10.71,00:24:10.71,">> Yeah. >> One, two, three, four..."
430,00:24:18.25,00:24:18.25,"Eight, nine, ten. And finally."
431,00:24:21.21,00:24:21.21,"This is so brutal. I can't imagine, #1,"
432,00:24:24.54,00:24:24.54,what ten paces is. And there was a lone palm tree
433,00:24:29.08,00:24:29.08,"for my next clue. I'm really at a loss right now,"
434,00:24:38.21,00:24:38.21,but I'm definitely not gonna give up looking for that idol.
435,00:24:42.21,00:24:42.21,"Oh, for God's sake. >> That's it."
436,00:24:56.33,00:24:56.33,No more water. Water is out.

561,00:30:39.46,00:30:39.46,There you go. >> Don't let 'em!
562,00:30:42.33,00:30:42.33,">> PROBST: Timbira, two steps away from being back in it."
563,00:30:45.17,00:30:45.17,>> You guys got it. >> PROBST: Timbira completes
564,00:30:50.33,00:30:50.33,their staircase. Two people inside.
565,00:30:55.54,00:30:55.54,A tough first challenge with immunity on the line.
566,00:30:59.92,00:30:59.92,Timbira working well together. Erinn and Brendan moving
567,00:31:03.12,00:31:03.12,quickly through this maze. >> Back. Your back.
568,00:31:05.54,00:31:05.54,">> No, this way's wrong. >> PROBST: Both Spencer and"
569,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,Sydney struggling a little bit. >> Keep it high.
570,00:31:09.54,00:31:09.54,Keep it high like that. >> PROBST: Timbira has erased
571,00:31:11.58,00:31:11.58,the lead Jalapao had. We're very even right now.
572,00:31:13.62,00:31:13.62,>> Find now. Find the rail first.
573,00:31:15.62,00:31:15.62,>> It's the middle road. The middle road on this next
574,00:31:17.92,00:31:17.92,turn. >> PROBST: Immunity on the line.
575,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,Nobody wants to go to Tribal Council.
576,00:31:22.42,00:31:22.42,Nothing good ever happens at Tribal Council.
577,00:31:24.54,00:31:24.54,>> It's hot. It's hot. >> PROBST: Timbira now with a
578,00:31:26.62,00:31:26.62,"bit of a lead, if they are right."
579,00:31:28.88,00:31:28.88,>> Hold it out. >> Take your time.
580,00:31:30.50,00:31:30.50,>> PROBST: Timbira very close. >> Take your time.
581,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,>> PROBST: Brendan and Erinn can smell it.
582,00:31:33.96,00:31:33.96,">> Take your time. >> PROBST: First challenge, the"
583,00:31:35.83,00:31:35.83,first win is this close. >> Bring 'em up!
584,00:31:37.71,00:31:37.71,">> Four, three, two, one. >> PROBST: That's it!"
585,00:31:40.38,00:31:40.38,(screaming and cheering) Timbira wins immunity!
586,00:31:43.54,00:31:43.54,>> Yeah! (screams and indistinct chatter)
587,00:31:47.08,00:31:47.08,">> One, two, three! >> Timbira!"
588,00:31:49.12,00:31:49.12,">> PROBST: Timbira, congratulations."
589,00:31:51.96,00:31:51.96,Fire. >> Yeah!
590,00:31:53.83,00:31:53.83,>> Fire. >> PROBST: That will make camp
591,00:31:56.21,00:31:56.21,"life a lot easier, right? >> Yes."
592,00:31:58.08,00:31:58.08,">> PROBST: And immunity. >> Yeah, right!"
593,00:31:59.92,00:31:59.92,>> PROBST: No Tribal Council for Timbira.
594,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,"Nobody going home. Jalapao, bad news for you guys."
595,00:32:05.04,00:32:05.04,Tribal Council tonight. The first person will be voted
596,00:32:07.33,00:32:07.33,"out of this game, and it's coming from your tribe."
597,00:32:09.62,00:32:09.62,You will have the afternoon to figure out who it's gonna be.
598,00:32:12.04,00:32:12.04,Head back to camp. >> That's sweet!
599,00:32:15.21,00:32:15.21,>> We got... (indistinct) >> Tribal Council was the one
600,00:32:19.62,00:32:19.62,thing that I was dreading because I don't want to vote
601,00:32:22.42,00:32:22.42,"for Sandy. I mean, she worked her ass off"
602,00:32:24.96,00:32:24.96,at the challenge. But I don't know who else to
603,00:32:27.21,00:32:27.21,vote for. >> Anybody want to go to the
604,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,water real quick? >> Yeah.
605,00:32:47.33,00:32:47.33,>> Yeah. >> The water.
606,00:32:49.25,00:32:49.25,>> The water. >> The challenge-- it was just
607,00:32:51.04,00:32:51.04,"heartbreaking. The vote's for Sandy,"
608,00:32:53.25,00:32:53.25,"unfortunately. But with every failure, there's"
609,00:32:55.75,00:32:55.75,an opportunity for growth. That's one of my #1 sayings.
610,00:33:00.21,00:33:00.21,What can our tribe do better at camp?
611,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,Maybe we could be a little bit more organized.
612,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,">> Like our shelter. You know, it..."
613,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,">> You know, it's the stuff like that, we'd love to just do it"
614,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,"all at once, but we're dehydrated and hungry and human."
615,00:33:17.33,00:33:17.33,">> Oh, I totally agree. I totally agree."
616,00:33:19.12,00:33:19.12,"But it's just, like, you know, like, and the..."
617,00:33:21.42,00:33:21.42,"You know, when it gets a little cooler today, let-let's wrap it"
618,00:33:24.00,00:33:24.00,"up, so, like... >> But how would that help us in"
619,00:33:26.12,00:33:26.12,challenges? >> I'm just making a suggestion.
620,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,">> Oh, I know. Don't... Don't get defensive."
621,00:33:29.83,00:33:29.83,Just listen for a second. >> Yeah. We're all gonna say
622,00:33:31.88,00:33:31.88,"something. >> So, you know, when we first"
623,00:33:33.79,00:33:33.79,"came back, we're hot, we're exhausted, we're lost, and the"
624,00:33:35.71,00:33:35.71,first thing you're going to tell somebody is you need to clean
625,00:33:37.96,00:33:37.96,up. Clean up the outdoors?!
626,00:33:39.54,00:33:39.54,"Are you kidding me? Basically, I just..."
627,00:33:41.67,00:33:41.67,"And I mean, you can listen. I don't care."
628,00:33:43.96,00:33:43.96,"But I just wanted to tell you. Sometimes you panic a bit, and"
629,00:33:46.62,00:33:46.62,"you get whiny. >> Oh, I know."
630,00:33:48.62,00:33:48.62,>> You need to curb that because it's only going to cause
631,00:33:50.96,00:33:50.96,tension in the group. >> Yeah.
632,00:33:52.54,00:33:52.54,>> It's just going to cause frustration.
633,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,>> I totally agree. I'm just telling you my
634,00:33:56.25,00:33:56.25,"viewpoint, and I totally agree. >> No. I know, I know, and"
635,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,that's why I'm pulling you aside so you can understand.
636,00:34:00.17,00:34:00.17,I'm not going to tell anybody else; I'm going to tell you.
637,00:34:02.08,00:34:02.08,">> Yeah. No, I agree. >> So you can completely"
638,00:34:03.71,00:34:03.71,understand what I'm talking about.
639,00:34:05.46,00:34:05.46,">> Taj called me out, and she was right."
640,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,"When it comes to, like, working or getting things done, you"
641,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,"know, I can get very opinionated and do speak my mind."
642,00:34:12.92,00:34:12.92,">> All right... >> Now, like, I've just been"
643,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,thinking about checking myself. (hooting)
644,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,">> I know, dude, right. >> I mean, unless everybody else"
645,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,is just dead set on getting rid of Sandy-- which I would
646,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,disagree with-- I'm wholeheartedly campaign Sandy or
647,00:34:35.96,00:34:35.96,whatever we want. My first impression of Sandy was
648,00:34:39.25,00:34:39.25,"that she might be a liability in challenges, but she proved"
649,00:34:41.96,00:34:41.96,"today that, you know, not so much."
650,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,"She did a great job. She's really into this, and it's"
651,00:34:46.88,00:34:46.88,"kind of like, why should we just-just based on first"
652,00:34:49.88,00:34:49.88,"impressions, sort of, and for no other reason, just kind of"
653,00:34:52.21,00:34:52.21,get rid of her? >> Just so you know what
654,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,"happened and what this means for Council or not, we get back to"
655,00:34:57.08,00:34:57.08,"the water, the first thing that, uh, Caroline starts talking"
656,00:34:59.54,00:34:59.54,about is how we need to finish stuff around camp.
657,00:35:07.04,00:35:07.04,">> Um... >> And honestly, I don't know if"
658,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,Sandy outperformed her. It was different tasks...
659,00:35:11.04,00:35:11.04,>> Yeah. >> ...but I don't think...
660,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,I don't think Caroline stuck out ahead of her.
661,00:35:15.83,00:35:15.83,"Between Sandy and Caroline, it's kind of a tricky decision, being"
662,00:35:19.12,00:35:19.12,that it's pretty close as to how they'll perform in future
663,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,challenges and how they'll add to the morale of the camp.
664,00:35:25.46,00:35:25.46,"The first option is obviously Sandy, just based on how old"
665,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,"she is. But, uh, Caroline can be very"
666,00:35:31.21,00:35:31.21,"bossy, and it's gotten worse. So, in this environment, that"
667,00:35:35.38,00:35:35.38,bossy streak will get old really quick.
668,00:35:43.46,00:35:43.46,">> I just feel bad 'cause I feel like you and I, like, when"
669,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,"I put down that ""older lady"" from that vote."
670,00:35:48.33,00:35:48.33,">> Yeah, yeah. >> I felt like, you know, I know"
671,00:35:50.88,00:35:50.88,"that hurt your feelings, and when I realized that it did,"
672,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,"like, I genuinely felt really bad."
673,00:35:55.25,00:35:55.25,>> Right. You know. >> And I'm sorry.
674,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"And I'm sorry for, like, yesterday."
675,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,">> Yeah, yeah. Me too. >> Yeah, yeah."
676,00:36:04.29,00:36:04.29,"But that's okay. You know, you don't have to be"
677,00:36:07.12,00:36:07.12,"sorry, you know, or anything, but, um, you know, if I'm the"
678,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,"one to go, then that's just the way it is."
679,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,"I'm glad I'm here today, and I'm hoping I'm going to be here"
680,00:36:16.79,00:36:16.79,tomorrow. But I believe my tribe is
681,00:36:21.17,00:36:21.17,"voting for me. So, um, I'm going to look for"
682,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,that idol. I'm definitely going to figure
683,00:36:27.04,00:36:27.04,"out what ten paces are, and I'm going to dig this time under"
684,00:36:31.00,00:36:31.00,"anything and everything, I guess."
685,00:37:01.29,00:37:01.29,>> PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch.
686,00:37:04.08,00:37:04.08,"Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame, dip it in"
687,00:37:07.38,00:37:07.38,and get fire. This is part of the ritual of
688,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,"Tribal Council because in this game, fire represents your life."
689,00:37:18.17,00:37:18.17,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
690,00:37:20.54,00:37:20.54,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
691,00:37:23.08,00:37:23.08,That will be the case for one of you tonight.
692,00:37:28.21,00:37:28.21,"All right, let's go back to the beginning."
693,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,"Sandy, within the first five minutes, you were voted out of"
694,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,your tribe based on the first impression that you were simply
695,00:37:37.08,00:37:37.08,"too old. >> Well, I guess I summed it up"
696,00:37:40.62,00:37:40.62,"with the first response when I said, ""I'm pissed,"" because,"
697,00:37:44.58,00:37:44.58,"you know, I've got my heart in this game, and I want to stay"
698,00:37:47.96,00:37:47.96,"in this game. >> PROBST: J.T., what are you"
699,00:37:50.33,00:37:50.33,guys talking about in regards to Sandy?
700,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,"You already voted her out. Now, she gets a free ride back"
701,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,"to camp. >> Well, we did that"
702,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,strategically to try to make the group stronger.
703,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,That was our point of view. We hoped she'd be at least
704,00:38:01.75,00:38:01.75,rounding up wood or get a camp picked out when we got there.
705,00:38:04.33,00:38:04.33,We didn't really know what to expect.
706,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,">> PROBST: So, Sydney, you had an expectation she better be at"
707,00:38:08.79,00:38:08.79,"camp doing something. >> Definitely, and she"
708,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,"definitely greeted us with open arms, but the next day, was a"
709,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,little different than I thought she was going to be.
710,00:38:16.67,00:38:16.67,She didn't really do much around camp.
711,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,She was going off by herself a lot.
712,00:38:21.17,00:38:21.17,">> PROBST: Sandy, let's explore that for a minute."
713,00:38:23.21,00:38:23.21,"It seems like after everything you went through on day one, the"
714,00:38:25.54,00:38:25.54,"expectation would be, on day two that you got some recovering"
715,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,"to do. >> Sure, but I wanted to collect"
716,00:38:31.29,00:38:31.29,my thoughts and get all that out of my head so that I could go
717,00:38:34.38,00:38:34.38,"back into them with nothing but positive, which I did."
718,00:38:36.71,00:38:36.71,">> PROBST: And so, are you trying to figure out, ""Okay,"
719,00:38:39.79,00:38:39.79,"they're seeing me as an old lady?"""
720,00:38:42.25,00:38:42.25,">> Oh, I know. >> PROBST: So do you start"
721,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,"thinking, ""How do I change that perception?"""
722,00:38:46.29,00:38:46.29,">> No, because I'm the old lady, no matter what."
723,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,But an old lady can also fit into this tribe of all these
724,00:38:52.54,00:38:52.54,kids that could be mine. (laughter)
725,00:38:55.17,00:38:55.17,">> PROBST: Sandy, you a little crazy?"
726,00:38:58.38,00:38:58.38,">> Oh, I'm a lot crazy. Yeah."
727,00:39:00.75,00:39:00.75,>> PROBST: So you're used to people looking at you and kind
728,00:39:03.08,00:39:03.08,"of going, ""Hmm. Not sure. Kind of amusing, a little odd."""
729,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,>> Mm-hmm. That's how it happens with me.
730,00:39:08.79,00:39:08.79,"I don't know why, but I like it. >> PROBST: Carolina, is it fair"
731,00:39:12.46,00:39:12.46,to vote out Sandy just because she's old?
732,00:39:15.79,00:39:15.79,She can't change that. >> I don't necessarily think
733,00:39:18.08,00:39:18.08,"that it's fair, but I felt like our team voted smart."
734,00:39:22.62,00:39:22.62,"And we could explain it 100 times, but it is what it is."
735,00:39:25.21,00:39:25.21,>> PROBST: What do you think the first impression of you was?
736,00:39:28.08,00:39:28.08,">> I'm very boisterous, so I'm not afraid to say my opinion."
737,00:39:32.08,00:39:32.08,And I could say that I came across a little demanding to
738,00:39:35.17,00:39:35.17,"get things done. Sometimes, my directness comes"
739,00:39:37.17,00:39:37.17,"across like maybe a little whiny, and I need to check"
740,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,"myself before I speak, and I openly admit that."
741,00:39:44.71,00:39:44.71,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to get to the vote."
742,00:39:47.04,00:39:47.04,"J.T., you're up. >> Carolina, I hope you're going"
