601,00:32:24.96,00:32:24.96,at the challenge.But I don't know who else to

608,00:32:55.75,00:32:55.75,an opportunity for growth.That's one of my #1 sayings.
609,00:33:00.21,00:33:00.21,What can our tribe do better atcamp?
610,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,Maybe we could be a little bitmore organized.
611,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,">> Like our shelter.You know, it..."
612,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,">> You know, it's the stuff likethat, we'd love to just do it"
613,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,"all at once, but we'redehydrated and hungry and human."
614,00:33:17.33,00:33:17.33,">> Oh, I totally agree.I totally agree."

623,00:33:35.71,00:33:35.71,first thing you're going to tellsomebody is you need to clean
624,00:33:37.96,00:33:37.96,up.Clean up the outdoors?!
625,00:33:39.54,00:33:39.54,"Are you kidding me?Basically, I just..."

629,00:33:48.62,00:33:48.62,>> You need to curb thatbecause it's only going to cause
630,00:33:50.96,00:33:50.96,tension in the group.>> Yeah.
631,00:33:52.54,00:33:52.54,>> It's just going to causefrustration.
632,00:33:54.38,00:33:54.38,>> I totally agree.I'm just telling you my
633,00:33:56.25,00:33:56.25,"viewpoint, and I totally agree.>> No. I know, I know, and"
634,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,that's why I'm pulling you asideso you can understand.
635,00:34:00.17,00:34:00.17,I'm not going to tell anybodyelse; I'm going to tell you.
636,00:34:02.08,00:34:02.08,">> Yeah. No, I agree.>> So you can completely"
637,00:34:03.71,00:34:03.71,understand what I'm talkingabout.
638,00:34:05.46,00:34:05.46,">> Taj called me out, and shewas right."
639,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,"When it comes to, like, workingor getting things done, you"
640,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,"know, I can get very opinionatedand do speak my mind."
641,00:34:12.92,00:34:12.92,">> All right...>> Now, like, I've just been"
642,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,thinking about checking myself.(hooting)
643,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,">> I know, dude, right.>> I mean, unless everybody else"
644,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,is just dead set on getting ridof Sandy-- which I would
645,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,disagree with-- I'mwholeheartedly campaign Sandy or
646,00:34:35.96,00:34:35.96,whatever we want.My first impression of Sandy was
647,00:34:39.25,00:34:39.25,"that she might be a liability inchallenges, but she proved"
648,00:34:41.96,00:34:41.96,"today that, you know, not somuch."
649,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,"She did a great job.She's really into this, and it's"
650,00:34:46.88,00:34:46.88,"kind of like, why should wejust-just based on first"
651,00:34:49.88,00:34:49.88,"impressions, sort of, and forno other reason, just kind of"
652,00:34:52.21,00:34:52.21,get rid of her?>> Just so you know what
653,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,"happened and what this means forCouncil or not, we get back to"
654,00:34:57.08,00:34:57.08,"the water, the first thing that,uh, Caroline starts talking"
655,00:34:59.54,00:34:59.54,about is how we need to finishstuff around camp.
656,00:35:07.04,00:35:07.04,">> Um...>> And honestly, I don't know if"
657,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,Sandy outperformed her.It was different tasks...
658,00:35:11.04,00:35:11.04,>> Yeah.>> ...but I don't think...
659,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,I don't think Caroline stuck outahead of her.
660,00:35:15.83,00:35:15.83,"Between Sandy and Caroline, it'skind of a tricky decision, being"
661,00:35:19.12,00:35:19.12,that it's pretty close as to howthey'll perform in future
662,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,challenges and how they'll addto the morale of the camp.
663,00:35:25.46,00:35:25.46,"The first option is obviouslySandy, just based on how old"
664,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,"she is.But, uh, Caroline can be very"
665,00:35:31.21,00:35:31.21,"bossy, and it's gotten worse.So, in this environment, that"
666,00:35:35.38,00:35:35.38,bossy streak will get oldreally quick.
667,00:35:43.46,00:35:43.46,">> I just feel bad 'cause Ifeel like you and I, like, when"
668,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,"I put down that ""older lady""from that vote."
669,00:35:48.33,00:35:48.33,">> Yeah, yeah.>> I felt like, you know, I know"
670,00:35:50.88,00:35:50.88,"that hurt your feelings, andwhen I realized that it did,"
671,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,"like, I genuinely felt reallybad."
672,00:35:55.25,00:35:55.25,>> Right. You know.>> And I'm sorry.
673,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"And I'm sorry for, like,yesterday."
674,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,">> Yeah, yeah. Me too.>> Yeah, yeah."
675,00:36:04.29,00:36:04.29,"But that's okay.You know, you don't have to be"
676,00:36:07.12,00:36:07.12,"sorry, you know, or anything,but, um, you know, if I'm the"
677,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,"one to go, then that's just theway it is."
678,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,"I'm glad I'm here today, andI'm hoping I'm going to be here"
679,00:36:16.79,00:36:16.79,tomorrow.But I believe my tribe is
680,00:36:21.17,00:36:21.17,"voting for me.So, um, I'm going to look for"
681,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,that idol.I'm definitely going to figure
682,00:36:27.04,00:36:27.04,"out what ten paces are, and I'mgoing to dig this time under"
683,00:36:31.00,00:36:31.00,"anything and everything, Iguess."
684,00:37:01.29,00:37:01.29,>> PROBST: Behind each of you isa torch.
685,00:37:04.08,00:37:04.08,"Go ahead and grab a torch,approach the flame, dip it in"
686,00:37:07.38,00:37:07.38,and get fire.This is part of the ritual of
687,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,"Tribal Council because in thisgame, fire represents your life."
688,00:37:18.17,00:37:18.17,"As long as you have fire, you'restill in the game."
689,00:37:20.54,00:37:20.54,"When your fire is gone, so areyou."
690,00:37:23.08,00:37:23.08,That will be the case for oneof you tonight.
691,00:37:28.21,00:37:28.21,"All right, let's go back to thebeginning."
692,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,"Sandy, within the first fiveminutes, you were voted out of"
693,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,your tribe based on the firstimpression that you were simply
694,00:37:37.08,00:37:37.08,"too old.>> Well, I guess I summed it up"
695,00:37:40.62,00:37:40.62,"with the first response when Isaid, ""I'm pissed,"" because,"
696,00:37:44.58,00:37:44.58,"you know, I've got my heart inthis game, and I want to stay"
697,00:37:47.96,00:37:47.96,"in this game.>> PROBST: J.T., what are you"
698,00:37:50.33,00:37:50.33,guys talking about in regards toSandy?
699,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,"You already voted her out.Now, she gets a free ride back"
700,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,"to camp.>> Well, we did that"
701,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,strategically to try to make thegroup stronger.
702,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,That was our point of view.We hoped she'd be at least
703,00:38:01.75,00:38:01.75,rounding up wood or get a camppicked out when we got there.
704,00:38:04.33,00:38:04.33,We didn't really know what toexpect.
705,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,">> PROBST: So, Sydney, you hadan expectation she better be at"
706,00:38:08.79,00:38:08.79,"camp doing something.>> Definitely, and she"
707,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,"definitely greeted us with openarms, but the next day, was a"
708,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,little different than I thoughtshe was going to be.
709,00:38:16.67,00:38:16.67,She didn't really do much aroundcamp.
710,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,She was going off by herself alot.
711,00:38:21.17,00:38:21.17,">> PROBST: Sandy, let's explorethat for a minute."
712,00:38:23.21,00:38:23.21,"It seems like after everythingyou went through on day one, the"
713,00:38:25.54,00:38:25.54,"expectation would be, on daytwo that you got some recovering"
714,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,"to do.>> Sure, but I wanted to collect"
715,00:38:31.29,00:38:31.29,my thoughts and get all that outof my head so that I could go
716,00:38:34.38,00:38:34.38,"back into them with nothing butpositive, which I did."
717,00:38:36.71,00:38:36.71,">> PROBST: And so, are youtrying to figure out, ""Okay,"
718,00:38:39.79,00:38:39.79,"they're seeing me as an oldlady?"""
719,00:38:42.25,00:38:42.25,">> Oh, I know.>> PROBST: So do you start"

721,00:38:46.29,00:38:46.29,">> No, because I'm the old lady,no matter what."
722,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,But an old lady can also fitinto this tribe of all these
723,00:38:52.54,00:38:52.54,kids that could be mine.(laughter)
724,00:38:55.17,00:38:55.17,">> PROBST: Sandy, you a littlecrazy?"
725,00:38:58.38,00:38:58.38,">> Oh, I'm a lot crazy.Yeah."
726,00:39:00.75,00:39:00.75,>> PROBST: So you're used topeople looking at you and kind
727,00:39:03.08,00:39:03.08,"of going, ""Hmm. Not sure.Kind of amusing, a little odd."""
728,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,>> Mm-hmm.That's how it happens with me.
729,00:39:08.79,00:39:08.79,"I don't know why, but I like it.>> PROBST: Carolina, is it fair"
730,00:39:12.46,00:39:12.46,to vote out Sandy just becauseshe's old?
731,00:39:15.79,00:39:15.79,She can't change that.>> I don't necessarily think
732,00:39:18.08,00:39:18.08,"that it's fair, but I felt likeour team voted smart."
733,00:39:22.62,00:39:22.62,"And we could explain it 100times, but it is what it is."
734,00:39:25.21,00:39:25.21,>> PROBST: What do you think thefirst impression of you was?
735,00:39:28.08,00:39:28.08,">> I'm very boisterous, so I'mnot afraid to say my opinion."
736,00:39:32.08,00:39:32.08,And I could say that I cameacross a little demanding to
737,00:39:35.17,00:39:35.17,"get things done.Sometimes, my directness comes"
738,00:39:37.17,00:39:37.17,"across like maybe a littlewhiny, and I need to check"
739,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,"myself before I speak, and Iopenly admit that."
740,00:39:44.71,00:39:44.71,">> PROBST: All right, it is timeto get to the vote."

742,00:40:11.08,00:40:11.08,to be the first one voted outand not me.
743,00:40:30.25,00:40:30.25,">> Sorry, Sandy.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
