91,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,>> You know what?There's no reason to be

376,00:24:32.96,00:24:32.96,"You need help, and if youdon't, you're gonna be worse."
377,00:24:36.04,00:24:36.04,"Russell, I watched you blackout in front of me two times."
378,00:24:40.71,00:24:40.71,There's no way you could havestayed in this game.
379,00:24:44.33,00:24:44.33,I'm gonna leave you aloneand stop talking.
380,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,(Russell sobbing softly)>> I feel bittersweet because
381,00:25:28.92,00:25:28.92,"we were close to winning, andthen big Russell had his"
382,00:25:32.75,00:25:32.75,medical accident.But when Jeff said that we
383,00:25:36.62,00:25:36.62,"still had to go to TribalCouncil, regardless of who won"
384,00:25:40.08,00:25:40.08,"the challenge, it wassurprising, and, you know, a"
385,00:25:45.54,00:25:45.54,little upsetting because noneof us want to go back there.
386,00:25:48.08,00:25:48.08,We were just there.>> I'm packing my bags.
387,00:26:03.50,00:26:03.50,>> I'm for sure packing mine.>> I have a fair sense of
388,00:26:07.17,00:26:07.17,what's going on.There's five of us.
389,00:26:09.25,00:26:09.25,"We're, again, one big family.Natalie and I, we both looked"
390,00:26:12.33,00:26:12.33,at each other and said it'sgonna be one of us.
391,00:26:15.17,00:26:15.17,"And it will be.I mean, at this point, we need"
392,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,"to continue to win, and itdoesn't make sense to vote out"
393,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,one of the guys.My gut tells me maybe I'll
394,00:26:22.96,00:26:22.96,"stick around because I'm justcompetitively stronger, but my"
395,00:26:26.12,00:26:26.12,fate and Natalie's fate rest inthe three guys in our tribe.
396,00:26:31.29,00:26:31.29,>> Your vote's very simpletonight.
397,00:26:34.62,00:26:34.62,">> What is it?>> It's Liz. And then, uh..."
398,00:26:37.42,00:26:37.42,>> She and I talked about it.>> And I'm... I'm trying my
399,00:26:41.62,00:26:41.62,best right now.Because you know you and Liz
400,00:26:45.25,00:26:45.25,"are the two names, of course.>> For sure. We knew that."
401,00:26:48.42,00:26:48.42,">> So, uh, 'cause I'm puttingLiz, you putting Liz."
402,00:26:51.79,00:26:51.79,I know I can talk Mick intoputting Liz no matter what.
403,00:26:55.08,00:26:55.08,">> I mean, no, she and Ialready talked."
404,00:26:56.96,00:26:56.96,"We know that it's pretty simple;I'm voting for her, and she's"
405,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,voting for me.>> Yeah.
406,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,>> How what?>> I'd like to stay if it's
407,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,possible.>> Every time that we come
408,00:27:32.83,00:27:32.83,"close to something good, itkind of gets taken away."
409,00:27:35.88,00:27:35.88,"So, winning today would havebeen our revenge, you know."
410,00:27:38.04,00:27:38.04,"They would have had to watch useat and, you know, understand"
411,00:27:40.33,00:27:40.33,how we felt.And we were winning.
412,00:27:43.25,00:27:43.25,I think what's the mostdisheartening is not
413,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,"necessarily the losses, butjust the random things that"
414,00:27:47.79,00:27:47.79,keep happening every time youthink you have something good
415,00:27:50.04,00:27:50.04,"to go bad.And, you know, I really hope"
416,00:27:53.75,00:27:53.75,"Russell's okay.I mean, that, clearly, is the"
417,00:27:55.92,00:27:55.92,primary concern.I agree with the decision to
418,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,cancel the challenge and allthat stuff.
419,00:27:59.42,00:27:59.42,"It just, uh, it just kind ofsucks that when you finally"
420,00:28:02.33,00:28:02.33,"feel like you're getting in agroove and going someplace,"
421,00:28:04.79,00:28:04.79,"it's like, ""No, sorry."">> Do you think we would have"
422,00:28:08.21,00:28:08.21,won that?>> I think we were winning
423,00:28:09.88,00:28:09.88,"by a lot.I'm just wondering, with all"
424,00:28:12.12,00:28:12.12,"the stars seeming to be alignedagainst us, how many of us"
425,00:28:16.04,00:28:16.04,"actually have a shot at gettingreal far, you know?"
426,00:28:19.67,00:28:19.67,">> Well, I mean, look at...>> This tribe could be done by"
427,00:28:23.29,00:28:23.29,"day 21, the rate we're going.>> I think it could be done."
428,00:28:28.08,00:28:28.08,I think it can be done.They'll have people flip
429,00:28:32.67,00:28:32.67,over there.>> I have a feeling that
430,00:28:47.42,00:28:47.42,"Shambo's going to be gunningfor me, and so I want to be"
431,00:28:50.33,00:28:50.33,"sure that you have my back.>> Hold on, hold on."
432,00:28:53.12,00:28:53.12,Shh! Shh! Don't talk!Don't talk!
433,00:28:55.58,00:28:55.58,"They were all over, andthey're probably up here,"
434,00:28:59.04,00:28:59.04,my crabs.>> Yeah.
435,00:29:01.67,00:29:01.67,">> If we were going to TribalCouncil, right now, Shambo is"
436,00:29:04.17,00:29:04.17,"going, 100%.>> Here's a medium."
437,00:29:07.21,00:29:07.21,">> From day one, she's neverreally jelled with the tribe,"
438,00:29:10.12,00:29:10.12,and she's been over to theother tribe.
439,00:29:13.58,00:29:13.58,"None of us have.And so when we merge, she could"
440,00:29:17.79,00:29:17.79,"very easily flop sides.>> So what's, what's the"
441,00:29:21.38,00:29:21.38,"skinny, baby?We're voting somebody off"
442,00:29:22.96,00:29:22.96,"tonight.>> I don't know, honestly, who"
443,00:29:24.92,00:29:24.92,should go home.I don't know.
444,00:29:28.08,00:29:28.08,"I didn't, like, I honestlydidn't think we'd come to like"
445,00:29:31.08,00:29:31.08,a second Tribal.I don't know.
446,00:29:32.88,00:29:32.88,">> Ever?>> I mean, I thought we would"
447,00:29:34.67,00:29:34.67,"go to the merge first.>> See, I'm just asking you guys"
448,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,to not write my name down today.>> Mm-hmm.
449,00:29:39.38,00:29:39.38,"I mean, I started the fire thefirst eight days we were here."
450,00:29:42.04,00:29:42.04,>> Yeah.>> Chief and I collected 100% of
451,00:29:44.08,00:29:44.08,the firewood the first eightdays we were here.
452,00:29:47.04,00:29:47.04,"I have been a good competitor,an honest competitor,"
453,00:29:50.29,00:29:50.29,a fair competitor.I have not lied to anyone in
454,00:29:52.62,00:29:52.62,"this game.>> That's fine, but despite the"
455,00:29:54.96,00:29:54.96,"fact, my name got writtendown twice."
456,00:29:56.92,00:29:56.92,The only person here who wroteit down last Tribal was you.
457,00:30:00.83,00:30:00.83,">> So, you're writing my namedown tonight?"
458,00:30:02.92,00:30:02.92,>> I don't know if I'm writingyour name down.
459,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,I can't guarantee you anything.>> Who-who made fire for you the
460,00:30:07.29,00:30:07.29,"first eight days you werehere, Monica?"
461,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,Who kept you warm and dryand safe?
462,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,>> Who didn't write myname down?
463,00:30:12.58,00:30:12.58,Everyone else in this tribeexcept for you!
464,00:30:15.25,00:30:15.25,"The number one reason forvoting off Shambo, for me, is"
465,00:30:18.17,00:30:18.17,the fact she wrote my name downlast time.
466,00:30:20.42,00:30:20.42,"And you got to take your enemyout the minute you can, and"
467,00:30:25.08,00:30:25.08,right now seems like anopportune moment.
468,00:30:31.33,00:30:31.33,">> As far as the weak girls go,who's the weakest girl?"
469,00:30:34.21,00:30:34.21,>> Monica.>> Totally!
470,00:30:35.38,00:30:35.38,>> Right?Bar none.
471,00:30:37.33,00:30:37.33,">> Yeah.>> And I'm sorry, as much as"
472,00:30:39.67,00:30:39.67,"people like to talk Shambo, wewould not have won the fishing"
473,00:30:42.71,00:30:42.71,gear in that first immunity andstarted this whole ball rolling
474,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,without her.And she poses no threat
475,00:30:47.12,00:30:47.12,"to anybody.>> Exactly, exactly."
476,00:30:48.29,00:30:48.29,>> No threat.>> Exactly. None.
477,00:30:51.50,00:30:51.50,">> Post-merge, she does nothave the power, the"
478,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,manipulative power that aLaura-Monica tag team or a
479,00:30:56.71,00:30:56.71,Laura or a Monica sole have.>> Voting Shambo off doesn't do
480,00:31:01.29,00:31:01.29,anything beneficial forany of us.
481,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,Monica needs to go forseveral reasons:
482,00:31:06.42,00:31:06.42,"one, Monica and Laura have thismother-daughter/sister-sister"
483,00:31:12.00,00:31:12.00,"relationship.Post-merge, that's gonna"
484,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,be dangerous.One of the two of them needs to
485,00:31:17.17,00:31:17.17,go while we still have achance to get 'em.
486,00:31:20.38,00:31:20.38,Laura will be severely weakenedwithout Monica.
487,00:31:23.54,00:31:23.54,"And Monica, I think, is theclear move because Monica"
488,00:31:28.17,00:31:28.17,doesn't help us win challengesat all.
489,00:31:30.29,00:31:30.29,Is there a better move thanthan that?
490,00:31:32.21,00:31:32.21,'Cause I can't think of any.>> This is not a bad plan.
491,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,">> So it's me, you, Brett, Davemakes four."
492,00:31:41.04,00:31:41.04,"Either Coach or Shambo comeback, we have numbers;"
493,00:31:44.08,00:31:44.08,game over.No one flips.
494,00:31:52.08,00:31:52.08,>> Who else out here hasn'tlied but me?
495,00:31:55.54,00:31:55.54,No one.Don't vote me off tonight.
496,00:31:57.42,00:31:57.42,">> Yeah, I know that about you,Sham, but I know... I know that"
497,00:32:01.88,00:32:01.88,"your effort speaks for itself.>> Obviously, it doesn't if"
498,00:32:04.54,00:32:04.54,you're not telling me you'renot writing my name down.
499,00:32:06.96,00:32:06.96,>> Just 'cause I'm not tellingyou I'm not writing your name
500,00:32:09.04,00:32:09.04,down doesn't mean I'm notwriting your name down.
501,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,>> Okay.>> Shambo is on a very
502,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,"need-to-know basis.Us four guys-- Dave, Brett, and"
503,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,John-- we're pretty good aboutkeeping the plan within the
504,00:32:19.50,00:32:19.50,four of us.We're not gonna be telling
505,00:32:22.88,00:32:22.88,her anything more than what sheneeds to know.
506,00:32:26.17,00:32:26.17,>> So where you at tonight?>> What are your thoughts?
507,00:32:29.88,00:32:29.88,">> Erik, if you were Shambo,who would you vote for tonight?"
508,00:32:32.21,00:32:32.21,>> Yeah.>> Not me.
509,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,">> Not you.>> If I was Shambo, I would"
510,00:32:36.58,00:32:36.58,probably stay consistent.>> Who?
511,00:32:39.75,00:32:39.75,>> Consistent.I'd stay consistent.
512,00:32:41.67,00:32:41.67,>> Meaning who you voted forlast time is probably your
513,00:32:44.12,00:32:44.12,best bet?>> You would stay consistent.
514,00:32:46.00,00:32:46.00,>> If I was Shambo.>> What if you were John?
515,00:32:50.25,00:32:50.25,">> Um, I would followthe leader; as in Shambo's"
516,00:32:56.88,00:32:56.88,the leader.>> Really?
517,00:32:58.21,00:32:58.21,"And if you were Erik, who wouldyou vote for?"
518,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,>> I'd vote for Monica.>> Really?
519,00:33:03.58,00:33:03.58,">> Who are you votingfor, Shambo?"
520,00:33:05.04,00:33:05.04,Do you get what this isabout yet?
521,00:33:06.75,00:33:06.75,">> Yeah, I do.>> Mm-hmm."
522,00:33:07.75,00:33:07.75,">> Brett's down with it.>> He is? Okay, good."
523,00:33:10.12,00:33:10.12,>> Dave's down with it.And that's a wrap.

525,00:33:14.21,00:33:14.21,>> Lock it up.>> No worries.
526,00:33:16.54,00:33:16.54,"If that's what you want fromme, that's what you've got."
527,00:33:18.96,00:33:18.96,>> And don't even-- Hounding atthis is not locking it up.
528,00:33:43.08,00:33:43.08,">> PROBST: Well, this is afirst-- 13 people at Tribal"
529,00:33:46.04,00:33:46.04,"Council.All right, let me give"
530,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,everybody an update.Russell was pulled from the
531,00:33:53.00,00:33:53.00,"game.After you guys left, the"
532,00:33:56.88,00:33:56.88,"doctors continued to monitorhis blood pressure, blood"
533,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"pressure was steady.Two, three minutes in, out of"
534,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,"nowhere, his heart rate droppedlike that."
535,00:34:07.58,00:34:07.58,"He blacked out again, went downon his back."
536,00:34:10.88,00:34:10.88,"At that point, there was noquestion he needed to be pulled"
537,00:34:14.04,00:34:14.04,from the game.It was the scariest moment I've
538,00:34:19.58,00:34:19.58,"ever had on this show.19 seasons, I have never been"
539,00:34:23.62,00:34:23.62,more afraid in my life of howbad things were.
540,00:34:27.71,00:34:27.71,"Russell was in terrible shape.So, the update now is that he"
541,00:34:33.71,00:34:33.71,"is in very good hands, beingmonitored, doing fine."
542,00:34:37.58,00:34:37.58,There was no way he could havecome back into the game.
543,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,"Shambo, what's your reaction tohearing that he's no longer in"
544,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,the game?>> I feel really sad that
545,00:34:46.54,00:34:46.54,"that's how he went out, becauseyou see this guy with this"
546,00:34:50.62,00:34:50.62,amazing heart and spirit biggerthan life.
547,00:34:55.38,00:34:55.38,"So, I mean, it's-- it'sterribly sad."
548,00:34:58.25,00:34:58.25,">> PROBST: Russell, on onehand, it's a break for Foa Foa."
549,00:35:02.50,00:35:02.50,">> Yeah, he was definitely thestrongest on their tribe."
550,00:35:05.71,00:35:05.71,"But I just don't like the factthat that's how he went out,"
551,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,"you know?I mean, if I was going to beat"
552,00:35:10.96,00:35:10.96,"him, I don't want to beat himlike that."
553,00:35:13.25,00:35:13.25,">> PROBST: Dave, what does itsay about this game, when"
554,00:35:16.12,00:35:16.12,you're watching not onlysomebody you're on a tribe
555,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67,"with, and you're also competingagainst, but just another human"
556,00:35:20.71,00:35:20.71,"being, going through thiscrisis?"
557,00:35:23.62,00:35:23.62,">> Well, you know, it'sdefinitely an eye-opener for me."
558,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,"I mean, you get out here andit's like a whole different"

597,00:37:22.42,00:37:22.42,and then it will be a differentstory then.

608,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,and that's supposed to make usnervous about a momentum shift?

615,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,"Foa Foa, you will not voteanybody out."
616,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,I'm seeing a lot of mixedreactions.
617,00:38:33.29,00:38:33.29,Some happy people.And some jaws that are hitting
618,00:38:35.96,00:38:35.96,"the floor.Erik, is this good news?"

640,00:39:44.33,00:39:44.33,that the events of today haveonly intensified the rivalry
641,00:39:48.42,00:39:48.42,between these two tribes.Foa Foa believes they've got a
642,00:39:52.17,00:39:52.17,"moral victory today, and nowthey can turn this game around."
643,00:39:55.71,00:39:55.71,"And Galu believing, ""Eventhough we lost Russell, his"
