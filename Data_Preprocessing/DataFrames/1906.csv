2,00:00:02.50,00:00:02.50,Survivor: Both tribes were hammered hard by wind and rain.
3,00:00:06.92,00:00:06.92,">> I have never in my life been this cold, had my hands this"
4,00:00:09.29,00:00:09.29,"destroyed, and my feet look so miserable."
5,00:00:16.04,00:00:16.04,We're freezing. >> PROBST: But with their huge
6,00:00:19.67,00:00:19.67,lead in numbers and rewards-- >> That looks so good.
7,00:00:23.25,00:00:23.25,>> PROBST: Galu still had plenty of reason to celebrate.
8,00:00:26.21,00:00:26.21,">> After I finish this, I'll take the whole team by myself."
9,00:00:29.21,00:00:29.21,>> PROBST: The only storm Galu couldn't weather was Shambo.
10,00:00:32.46,00:00:32.46,">> Escaped chicken, escaped chicken."
11,00:00:34.25,00:00:34.25,9-1-1. >> Shambo is just a complete
12,00:00:38.04,00:00:38.04,Gilligan who just messes things up all the time.
13,00:00:42.46,00:00:42.46,">> PROBST: On her second visit to the Foa Foa tribe, it became"
14,00:00:45.83,00:00:45.83,clear these were Shambo's real friends.
15,00:00:49.12,00:00:49.12,">> I am really, really happy to be over here with Foa Foa."
16,00:00:52.58,00:00:52.58,">> PROBST: Russell, on the other hand, had no friends,"
17,00:00:55.04,00:00:55.04,"only targets. >> Marisa threatened me, Betsy"
18,00:00:58.54,00:00:58.54,"threatened me-- each time somebody threatened me, they're"
19,00:01:01.42,00:01:01.42,going home. >> PROBST: and when Liz
20,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,confronted Russell. >> You are lying to me.
21,00:01:04.92,00:01:04.92,>> I'm telling you the truth. Are you telling me I'm not
22,00:01:06.88,00:01:06.88,honest? >> PROBST: She became next on
23,00:01:08.38,00:01:08.38,his hit list. But after Liz's strong effort
24,00:01:10.79,00:01:10.79,in another loss-- Galu wins immunity.
25,00:01:14.33,00:01:14.33,Russell put his vendetta against her on the back burner
26,00:01:17.62,00:01:17.62,"in order to jettison the tribe's weakest member, Ashley."
27,00:01:21.08,00:01:21.08,>> It's because of me you're going home.
28,00:01:23.17,00:01:23.17,I'm out here playing for $1 million.
29,00:01:25.67,00:01:25.67,Never trust me. >> PROBST: With only five Foa
30,00:01:29.54,00:01:29.54,"Foa left, Liz needs a miracle to save herself from Russell's"
31,00:01:33.12,00:01:33.12,"cruel intentions, assuming they can all survive the conditions."
32,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
33,00:01:47.04,00:01:47.04,(thunder crashing) >> Are you shaking?
34,00:02:01.46,00:02:01.46,>> Yeah. >> You're that cold?
35,00:02:05.96,00:02:05.96,"I mean, I'm cold, too, but geez."
36,00:02:07.79,00:02:07.79,">> okay, Mick's having a seizure over here."
37,00:02:09.75,00:02:09.75,"He's epileptic. >> Since day ten, this is day"
38,00:02:14.08,00:02:14.08,"15 now, we're getting soaked at night."
39,00:02:18.08,00:02:18.08,"It's cold. So, it's been pretty bad for"
40,00:02:19.79,00:02:19.79,"the last several nights. I'll be honest, like there was"
41,00:02:24.75,00:02:24.75,some envy last night when Ashley went home.
42,00:02:28.08,00:02:28.08,There was a little tinge of jealousy there.
43,00:02:29.75,00:02:29.75,"I was like, ""Oh, man,"" you know? >> I really think we got"
44,00:02:34.54,00:02:34.54,"another two days of this, three days, something."
45,00:02:43.83,00:02:43.83,>> I used to watch this cartoon when I was growing up called
46,00:02:46.92,00:02:46.92,"Captain Planet, and there was always that one guy with the"
47,00:02:50.29,00:02:50.29,"ring, heart, and we always make fun of him."
48,00:02:53.75,00:02:53.75,"Like, ""What is heart?"" Everybody else gets a real"
49,00:02:55.54,00:02:55.54,"element and you get heart."" And I really wish I had that"
50,00:02:57.67,00:02:57.67,"heart ring right now. Because I'm tired, I'm really"
51,00:03:00.29,00:03:00.29,"hungry, and I'm sitting here trying to battle what seems to"
52,00:03:03.92,00:03:03.92,be a battle that fate just doesn't want us to win.
53,00:03:07.83,00:03:07.83,What do you think? Yeah.
54,00:03:10.58,00:03:10.58,>> It's not bad. >> It's not bad.
55,00:03:14.79,00:03:14.79,>> This is the man test. >> If it takes seven days and
56,00:03:18.75,00:03:18.75,"seven nights of rain for one person to quit, I'll take it."
57,00:03:24.12,00:03:24.12,"Hell, yeah, I'm having fun. I'm out in the rain."
58,00:03:27.96,00:03:27.96,This is how I want it to be. That sunny days we had for nine
59,00:03:31.21,00:03:31.21,"days, I was like, ""Man, this is too pretty."
60,00:03:34.54,00:03:34.54,"I'd take my family here."" I want to be somewhere where I"
61,00:03:37.42,00:03:37.42,"can't take my family, where it's miserable."
62,00:03:40.08,00:03:40.08,">> (laughing) >> What's wrong, man?"
63,00:03:45.00,00:03:45.00,">> I'm so freaking cold right now, it's ridiculous."
64,00:03:48.83,00:03:48.83,>> So silly. >> I'm freezing!
65,00:03:54.58,00:03:54.58,">> Come on, man. You can take this."
66,00:03:57.12,00:03:57.12,It's just a little water. Man.
67,00:04:00.62,00:04:00.62,>> This isn't even right. >> They're going to be soaking
68,00:04:05.12,00:04:05.12,"wet, whether it stops raining or not stops raining."
69,00:04:09.00,00:04:09.00,"Tonight, they're going to be wet, so this is really no big"
70,00:04:11.58,00:04:11.58,"deal. As a matter of fact, this makes"
71,00:04:14.46,00:04:14.46,me stronger. (theme song playing)
72,00:05:58.17,00:05:58.17,(thunder rumbling) (thunder crashing) 
73,00:06:28.08,00:06:28.08,>> A what? >> It's raining.
74,00:06:33.17,00:06:33.17,People are miserable. Spirits are down.
75,00:06:36.62,00:06:36.62,And it could all be alleviated had Russell gotten us that tarp.
76,00:06:42.42,00:06:42.42,But it's just the way the game goes sometimes.
77,00:06:46.04,00:06:46.04,"You know, one person is elected to make decisions for the group."
78,00:06:49.58,00:06:49.58,"Sometimes, it puts you in a worse position than you would"
79,00:06:51.92,00:06:51.92,have been if you were making those decisions for yourself.
80,00:06:54.25,00:06:54.25,"(thunder crashing) >> Welcome to Samoa, brother."
81,00:07:00.21,00:07:00.21,Rain doesn't stop. Russell's an animal.
82,00:07:12.29,00:07:12.29,>> Where is he? >> Right there.
83,00:07:16.00,00:07:16.00,">> Oh, yeah. >> Russell was out working on"
84,00:07:18.62,00:07:18.62,the fire while every single one of us was huddled up trying to
85,00:07:22.21,00:07:22.21,"stay warm, just trying to keep sane, and he's out there just"
86,00:07:24.67,00:07:24.67,"busting his butt. For me to see that, you know,"
87,00:07:28.83,00:07:28.83,"it's awesome to see him push himself, but, also, like, you"
88,00:07:31.75,00:07:31.75,"know, it's great that you're out there doing it, but at the"
89,00:07:34.12,00:07:34.12,"same time, it's like, no one expects you to do that."
90,00:07:38.96,00:07:38.96,"You know, it might have been to a point where it was a bit"
91,00:07:41.17,00:07:41.17,unnecessary and went a little bit too far.
92,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,>> You know what? There's no reason to be
93,00:07:47.08,00:07:47.08,sitting out here right now. >> I'd rather be in the
94,00:07:52.12,00:07:52.12,"shelter, but sometimes you have to make some deposits in case"
95,00:07:55.21,00:07:55.21,you need any withdrawals later on.
96,00:07:58.21,00:07:58.21,"You know, the chief thing counter-balances to the"
97,00:08:00.75,00:08:00.75,"negative, so just trying to keep the fire burning."
98,00:08:04.42,00:08:04.42,This is buying stock low. Hopefully I'll be able to sell
99,00:08:08.04,00:08:08.04,"high later. >> Fire looks good though, huh?"
100,00:08:15.04,00:08:15.04,>> I just got a chill. Hold on.
101,00:08:19.96,00:08:19.96,">> Careful, careful, careful! >> Are you okay?"
102,00:08:22.46,00:08:22.46,>> Just hand me my jacket. Just hand me my jacket.
103,00:08:25.12,00:08:25.12,>> Here you go. >> Goodness!
104,00:08:27.83,00:08:27.83,"Oh, that sucked. That sucked."
105,00:08:31.33,00:08:31.33,">> Russell's definitely got this, like, stubborn"
106,00:08:33.54,00:08:33.54,"determination to do everything. But truth is, like, the"
107,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,"elements out here, like, it's going to break you down."
108,00:08:38.12,00:08:38.12,He's just pushing himself too hard and it's going to take its
109,00:08:40.92,00:08:40.92,"toll, you know. >> I can go back out there."
110,00:08:44.04,00:08:44.04,I just got to get my body temperature back up.
111,00:08:57.21,00:08:57.21,(thunder crashing) >> I probably look like some
112,00:09:20.33,00:09:20.33,"crazy person, but basically, this spot actually is a pretty"
113,00:09:24.12,00:09:24.12,good cover. I can kind of-- with my body
114,00:09:29.38,00:09:29.38,"heat, kind of keep this corner a little bit warm."
115,00:09:32.96,00:09:32.96,"The shelter has so many gaps in it, that when it rains this"
116,00:09:36.46,00:09:36.46,"hard, it just pours right through."
117,00:09:39.00,00:09:39.00,I can't wear my clothes because they're all soaking wet.
118,00:09:41.71,00:09:41.71,So I'm just doing the best I can at just trying to stay
119,00:09:45.96,00:09:45.96,semi-warm and out of the rain and...
120,00:09:51.21,00:09:51.21,Just trying to get through this. >> It's wet.
121,00:10:02.92,00:10:02.92,"They don't want to get out. Where are they all from, New"
122,00:10:05.04,00:10:05.04,"York City? ""Got to stay dry."
123,00:10:09.33,00:10:09.33,"Can't get my hair wet."" Man, this is crazy."
124,00:10:25.25,00:10:25.25,">> You never know, man, they might also sucking each other's"
125,00:10:29.00,00:10:29.00,thumbs because they're just a bunch of babies.
126,00:10:31.50,00:10:31.50,That's why we lose the challenges because they're lazy.
127,00:10:34.29,00:10:34.29,"They give up. They start walking, they start,"
128,00:10:38.46,00:10:38.46,"""I'm too tired."" Don't stop until you throw up,"
129,00:10:42.46,00:10:42.46,"you pass out, something. If you don't throw up after"
130,00:10:45.04,00:10:45.04,"every frickin' challenge, you didn't do your job."
131,00:10:47.42,00:10:47.42,"That's how I think of it. Now, it was freezing last night,"
132,00:10:53.04,00:10:53.04,"wet, cold. It's time to do something about"
133,00:10:56.29,00:10:56.29,"it today, but they don't want to."
134,00:10:58.38,00:10:58.38,They want to sit there and suck on their thumbs.
135,00:11:01.54,00:11:01.54,So I don't know how to help them.
136,00:11:03.71,00:11:03.71,I don't think it's going to stop raining.
137,00:11:12.25,00:11:12.25,(thunder rumbling) >> (groans)
138,00:11:30.17,00:11:30.17,"I had been in my hole for, you know, almost 26 straight hours"
139,00:11:35.17,00:11:35.17,"of rain, and I was laying in the hole and I was, like, ""Okay,"
140,00:11:39.08,00:11:39.08,I give in. We give in. We understand your greatness.
141,00:11:43.21,00:11:43.21,"We understand your power. And if you are kind to us, I"
142,00:11:46.25,00:11:46.25,"promise we will speak of your mercy."""
143,00:11:49.21,00:11:49.21,"And less than 12 hours later, I wake up from my hole, and not"
144,00:11:51.42,00:11:51.42,"only is it blue skies, but the most beautiful rainbow you have"
145,00:11:54.08,00:11:54.08,"ever seen. It's as if Samoa said, ""That's"
146,00:11:57.96,00:11:57.96,"all I wanted to hear, Erik. Just know I'm the man, you're"
147,00:12:01.08,00:12:01.08,"not. Now that we got that clear,"
148,00:12:03.92,00:12:03.92,"enjoy yourself for the next 24 days."""
149,00:12:07.42,00:12:07.42,"I'm so happy. >> That's a nice sign, isn't it?"
150,00:12:10.46,00:12:10.46,>> That's a real nice sign. I don't think they have a
151,00:12:12.96,00:12:12.96,rainbow on Foa Foa's side of the island.
152,00:12:15.21,00:12:15.21,">> A rainbow. That is really, really nice to"
153,00:12:17.38,00:12:17.38,"wake up to. I mean, getting a ray of"
154,00:12:20.50,00:12:20.50,sunshine today was like-- you talk about lifting spirits.
155,00:12:24.71,00:12:24.71,"You know, winning challenges and rewards-- nothing beat this"
156,00:12:26.62,00:12:26.62,morning. >> Look at that!
157,00:12:29.96,00:12:29.96,>> I feel like we just got off of Noah's Ark.
158,00:12:33.12,00:12:33.12,>> There actually is a sky out there other than just clouds.
159,00:12:36.75,00:12:36.75,Can you believe it? Look!
160,00:12:40.08,00:12:40.08,There's blue sky out there! I think going through a storm
161,00:12:43.50,00:12:43.50,"like this, I think it definitely brings the tribe"
162,00:12:45.62,00:12:45.62,"together, 'cause we weathered it all together."
163,00:12:48.46,00:12:48.46,"Now that we're out, we know we've got a task at hand, and"
164,00:12:51.96,00:12:51.96,"we're stronger than ever. I mean, we really are."
165,00:13:01.83,00:13:01.83,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Galu, getting your first look at"
166,00:13:13.08,00:13:13.08,the new Foa Foa tribe. Ashley voted out at the last
167,00:13:16.83,00:13:16.83,"Tribal Council. All right, you guys ready to"
168,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,get to today's challenge? >> Yes.
169,00:13:23.38,00:13:23.38,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, one person from each"
170,00:13:25.54,00:13:25.54,tribe will be strapped into a large sphere.
171,00:13:29.71,00:13:29.71,That person will then guide two blindfolded tribe mates as they
172,00:13:33.33,00:13:33.33,push the sphere through a long course to a table maze.
173,00:13:38.08,00:13:38.08,The person inside the sphere will then guide the rest of
174,00:13:41.75,00:13:41.75,their blindfolded tribe mates as they navigate a ball through
175,00:13:45.00,00:13:45.00,a table maze to a finish hole. First tribe to get it right
176,00:13:49.12,00:13:49.12,wins reward. Want to know what you're
177,00:13:51.04,00:13:51.04,playing for? >> Yes!
178,00:13:53.12,00:13:53.12,">> PROBST: Pizza! Hot, piping pizza."
179,00:13:56.62,00:13:56.62,You guys have been enduring a lot of rain.
180,00:13:59.08,00:13:59.08,"A nice, hot pizza will go down really good, right?"
181,00:14:02.17,00:14:02.17,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: There's one twist--"
182,00:14:05.46,00:14:05.46,"win or lose, both tribes going to Tribal Council."
183,00:14:11.08,00:14:11.08,Both tribes will vote somebody out tonight.
184,00:14:15.50,00:14:15.50,You'll enjoy the pizza tonight when the winning tribe sits in
185,00:14:20.21,00:14:20.21,on the losing tribe's Tribal Council.
186,00:14:21.62,00:14:21.62,">> Oh, yeah, yeah. >> PROBST: So, not only will"
187,00:14:24.54,00:14:24.54,"you see what is going on within the tribe, you will do it by"

192,00:14:49.08,00:14:49.08,leader. I got to go forward.
193,00:14:51.79,00:14:51.79,I can't look back. And I'm playing the game.
194,00:14:55.08,00:14:55.08,"Monica, Kelly, Shambo, Dave. >> PROBST: All right, you four"
195,00:15:01.88,00:15:01.88,"take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, give you a"
196,00:15:03.46,00:15:03.46,minute to strategize. We'll get started.
197,00:15:07.04,00:15:07.04,"For Foa Foa, navigating in the ball is Liz; pushing, Russell"
198,00:15:11.50,00:15:11.50,"and Jaison. For Galu, it's Laura in the"
199,00:15:15.12,00:15:15.12,ball; Russell and Erik doing the pushing.
200,00:15:17.88,00:15:17.88,Here we go! Survivors ready?
201,00:15:22.21,00:15:22.21,"Go! >> Straight, straight."

224,00:16:27.04,00:16:27.04,"Hold on, hold on. >> One short turn."
225,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33,"Perfect, now bring it home. We're almost there."
226,00:16:31.12,00:16:31.12,>> PROBST: Foa Foa very close. Galu stuck.

231,00:16:44.67,00:16:44.67,"Okay, now-- >> PROBST: Foa Foa."
232,00:16:46.88,00:16:46.88,You're good. Now you've got to orient Liz so
233,00:16:48.42,00:16:48.42,she can see. >> Upright.
234,00:16:49.54,00:16:49.54,">> Yeah, pull up. Pull up >> Towards me!"
235,00:16:53.17,00:16:53.17,"Russ, Russ, harder, push harder. >> PROBST: Russell, Erik, and"
236,00:16:55.83,00:16:55.83,Laura still struggling to get to the finish.
237,00:16:57.88,00:16:57.88,">> Okay, now, get into your positions."

246,00:17:25.12,00:17:25.12,"Left, Russ, left. >> Hold on. Stop."
247,00:17:28.50,00:17:28.50,>> Russell. >> Russell!
248,00:17:30.21,00:17:30.21,>> Russell! >> PROBST: Laura trying to get
249,00:17:32.75,00:17:32.75,Russell on the course. He is exhausted.
250,00:17:35.38,00:17:35.38,>> Don't fall. >> PROBST: He has no idea where
251,00:17:37.54,00:17:37.54,"he's at right now. >> Lean down, lean down."
252,00:17:39.79,00:17:39.79,"Go to your right, go to your right, go to your right."
253,00:17:42.21,00:17:42.21,">> Grab the handle! >> Jaison, push your hands down."
254,00:17:44.42,00:17:44.42,">> Straight down, Mick, straight down."
255,00:17:45.83,00:17:45.83,>> Straight down. >> PROBST: Foa Foa now has a bit
256,00:17:48.17,00:17:48.17,"of a lead on the table maze. >> Brett, down."
257,00:17:50.62,00:17:50.62,"Brett down! John, up."
258,00:17:53.08,00:17:53.08,The ball is right in the middle. >> Don't move. Don't move.
259,00:17:57.29,00:17:57.29,Don't move! Stop moving. Stop moving!
260,00:18:02.67,00:18:02.67,">> Russell, get off the table. >> Russell, get off the table."
261,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,>> Russell. >> PROBST: Whoa?
262,00:18:09.79,00:18:09.79,"Russell, you with me? Hold up, hold up, hold up."
263,00:18:12.79,00:18:12.79,Everybody hold up. Medical!
264,00:18:15.25,00:18:15.25,Medical! Hold where you are.
265,00:18:17.75,00:18:17.75,"Everybody, hold where you are. >> Hold it, hold it, Galu."
266,00:18:21.50,00:18:21.50,Hold it right here. >> PROBST: Hold right where you
267,00:18:23.04,00:18:23.04,"are. >> Yeah, yeah."
268,00:18:26.75,00:18:26.75,I'm good. >> PROBST: He-- he was out.
269,00:18:29.71,00:18:29.71,"He was definitely out. >> Yeah, I saw that."
270,00:18:31.75,00:18:31.75,">> Russell, can you sit down for a moment?"
271,00:18:33.71,00:18:33.71,">> PROBST: Yeah, yeah, take over."
272,00:18:35.04,00:18:35.04,">> Russell, sit down. Russell."
273,00:18:39.54,00:18:39.54,Lie him down. Can you get the last pack?
274,00:18:45.96,00:18:45.96,">> Russell, can you hear me? >> Come on, Russ."
275,00:18:55.08,00:18:55.08,">> Russ? Russ, talk to me."
276,00:18:57.21,00:18:57.21,Can someone get me that life pack?
277,00:18:58.50,00:18:58.50,">> Danielle, can you get the life pack?"
278,00:19:02.29,00:19:02.29,>> Russell passed out during the challenge.
279,00:19:04.46,00:19:04.46,"I mean, I saw him stumbling around, staggering."
280,00:19:06.04,00:19:06.04,And I figured it was because he was blindfolded.
281,00:19:09.12,00:19:09.12,I couldn't figure out exactly what was going on.
282,00:19:11.25,00:19:11.25,I should have guessed he passed out.
283,00:19:14.12,00:19:14.12,">> Russell, you can hear me? >> I'm good."
284,00:19:17.83,00:19:17.83,Let's go. Let's go.
285,00:19:20.29,00:19:20.29,>> PROBST: You passed out for a minute.
286,00:19:22.17,00:19:22.17,You weren't with us for a second.
287,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,Just relax and let them do what they're doing.
288,00:19:26.42,00:19:26.42,"Everybody, you can take off your blindfolds."
289,00:19:34.04,00:19:34.04,">> Your blood pressure is really low too, Russ."
290,00:19:36.58,00:19:36.58,I'm just going to have a listen to your heart there.
291,00:19:42.75,00:19:42.75,">> I'm cool. I mean, I was a little winded"
292,00:19:44.58,00:19:44.58,"from pushing the ball, but I'm good."
293,00:19:46.46,00:19:46.46,">> You just need to relax just for a little while, okay?"
294,00:19:54.38,00:19:54.38,">> PROBST: Ramona, what's the update?"
295,00:19:56.83,00:19:56.83,>> His blood pressure is even lower than Mike's was.
296,00:20:01.58,00:20:01.58,"If we stood him up now, he'd just black out and collapse"
297,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,"again. >> PROBST: All right, here's--"
298,00:20:06.25,00:20:06.25,here's what's going to happen. I'm going to make a call right
299,00:20:08.42,00:20:08.42,"now, which is this challenge is over."
300,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,Neither tribe wins reward. Both tribes will go to Tribal
301,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,Council tonight. Both tribes will vote somebody
302,00:20:18.62,00:20:18.62,out tonight. You're going to both head back
303,00:20:21.17,00:20:21.17,to camp. We'll stay here and monitor
304,00:20:23.21,00:20:23.21,Russell. If he's able to return to the
305,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,"game, you'll see him at Tribal Council."
306,00:20:27.92,00:20:27.92,"Foa Foa, grab your stuff, head on out."
307,00:20:30.50,00:20:30.50,">> Feel better, Russell. >> PROBST: All right, Galu,"
308,00:20:35.46,00:20:35.46,grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
309,00:20:38.08,00:20:38.08,">> We'll be waiting for you, Russ. Get better."
310,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,">> We'll see you back there. >> PROBST: Either way, we'll"
311,00:20:41.25,00:20:41.25,see you tonight at Tribal Council.
312,00:20:42.46,00:20:42.46,">> Hang tight, chief. >> If he comes back, I will be"
313,00:21:00.25,00:21:00.25,"shocked. I'll be happy, but I'll be"
314,00:21:02.33,00:21:02.33,shocked. >> You think Russ is okay?
315,00:21:07.00,00:21:07.00,>> No. >> You don't think he's coming
316,00:21:09.62,00:21:09.62,back? >> No.
317,00:21:11.38,00:21:11.38,"But I'm not a doctor, I don't know."
318,00:21:18.04,00:21:18.04,>> Everyone's concerned about Russell.
319,00:21:21.12,00:21:21.12,"For Russell to go down the way he did today, it shows you how"
320,00:21:24.33,00:21:24.33,tough this game is. No one has any experience with
321,00:21:28.21,00:21:28.21,this level of dehydration. No one has any experience with
322,00:21:31.04,00:21:31.04,the level of malnutrition that we go through.
323,00:21:33.29,00:21:33.29,And a guy like Russell gives you everything he's got and
324,00:21:35.38,00:21:35.38,"more every single time, and then he comes back and he's a"
325,00:21:38.04,00:21:38.04,workhorse. And his body failed him today.
326,00:21:41.42,00:21:41.42,And it's so unfortunate. >> I'm about to make a break
327,00:21:45.38,00:21:45.38,for the shelter. (thunder crashing)
328,00:21:55.88,00:21:55.88,">> I'm so sick of the rain. >> Yeah, me, too."
329,00:22:03.12,00:22:03.12,>> Our leader's not here. And that's a big hit to take.
330,00:22:06.96,00:22:06.96,(thunder crashing) It's kind of surreal.
331,00:22:11.21,00:22:11.21,We're kind of just not really knowing really what to do.
332,00:22:14.29,00:22:14.29,"We're used to, we're used to rallying and saying, ""Okay,"
333,00:22:16.96,00:22:16.96,"give us our game plan."" (thunder crashing)"
334,00:22:19.12,00:22:19.12,"Uh, but you can't let these emotional things distract you"
335,00:22:23.29,00:22:23.29,too much out of the game. You have to keep your focus.
336,00:22:26.04,00:22:26.04,"Uh, we still are playing the game."
337,00:22:28.50,00:22:28.50,"We're still thinking about the next person that, that's"
338,00:22:30.67,00:22:30.67,going to go. But I know my heart is really
339,00:22:33.75,00:22:33.75,heavy for Russell. I just hope that he's okay.
340,00:22:45.42,00:22:45.42,"(sighs) >> All right, we'll try and sit"
341,00:22:51.04,00:22:51.04,him up. >> PROBST: Sounds good.
342,00:22:52.88,00:22:52.88,>> All right. >> I just want you to sit up
343,00:22:55.83,00:22:55.83,from where you are. Just to there.
344,00:23:00.25,00:23:00.25,Any head spins there? >> A little light-headed.
345,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,>> A little light-headed? Okay. Stay exactly like that.
346,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83,I'm gonna take your blood pressure again straight away
347,00:23:09.42,00:23:09.42,and see what change we got. (device beeping)
348,00:23:11.42,00:23:11.42,"Russ, are you okay? Russ?"
349,00:23:15.08,00:23:15.08,"Russ? Russ? Just lie down. Come on, Russ. Russ?"
350,00:23:18.54,00:23:18.54,"Russ? Russ, are you with us? Lie down. Russ?"
351,00:23:21.67,00:23:21.67,">> Russell. >> Russ, talk to me."
352,00:23:24.17,00:23:24.17,"Russ, talk to me. Russell, Russell,"
353,00:23:27.79,00:23:27.79,"wake up, mate. Wake up."
354,00:23:30.21,00:23:30.21,You there? Mm-hmm? Do you remember what
355,00:23:32.25,00:23:32.25,just happened? >> Huh?
356,00:23:33.38,00:23:33.38,">> His heart rate was 97 when we sat him up, and now it's 68."
357,00:23:37.08,00:23:37.08,Okay? >> PROBST: And it dropped
358,00:23:38.75,00:23:38.75,like that. >> It dropped really
359,00:23:40.12,00:23:40.12,quickly. >> PROBST: Just so you're clear
360,00:23:46.08,00:23:46.08,"on what's happening is, is we're going to have to pull"
361,00:23:48.67,00:23:48.67,you out of the game. There's no question to all of
362,00:23:51.21,00:23:51.21,"us watching, brother, that, that you are not okay."
363,00:23:54.17,00:23:54.17,">> Come on, come on. >> PROBST: Russell, we've hung"
364,00:23:56.17,00:23:56.17,in there as long as we can. You are not doing well.
365,00:23:58.71,00:23:58.71,"I just watched your, your heart rate plummet."
366,00:24:01.96,00:24:01.96,>> My family depends on me to be the strong one.
367,00:24:05.75,00:24:05.75,Is this how you want this to end?
368,00:24:08.00,00:24:08.00,">> PROBST: No, no. It's frustrating to be pulled"
369,00:24:10.29,00:24:10.29,out of a game you wanted to be a part of for so long.
370,00:24:14.00,00:24:14.00,You were in great shape. You were the leader of a tribe
371,00:24:16.88,00:24:16.88,that was dominating. You heard no sign that you were
372,00:24:19.21,00:24:19.21,going home any time soon. You pushed and pushed and
373,00:24:22.04,00:24:22.04,"pushed your body until your body said, ""Enough."""
374,00:24:25.54,00:24:25.54,"There's nothing about that that is a quitter, nothing."
375,00:24:29.21,00:24:29.21,>> But I'm just dehydrated. I'm not...
376,00:24:31.04,00:24:31.04,>> PROBST: But you're not recovering fast enough.
377,00:24:32.96,00:24:32.96,"You need help, and if you don't, you're gonna be worse."
378,00:24:36.04,00:24:36.04,"Russell, I watched you black out in front of me two times."
379,00:24:40.71,00:24:40.71,There's no way you could have stayed in this game.
380,00:24:44.33,00:24:44.33,I'm gonna leave you alone and stop talking.
381,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,(Russell sobbing softly) >> I feel bittersweet because
382,00:25:28.92,00:25:28.92,"we were close to winning, and then big Russell had his"
383,00:25:32.75,00:25:32.75,medical accident. But when Jeff said that we
384,00:25:36.62,00:25:36.62,"still had to go to Tribal Council, regardless of who won"
385,00:25:40.08,00:25:40.08,"the challenge, it was surprising, and, you know, a"
386,00:25:45.54,00:25:45.54,little upsetting because none of us want to go back there.
387,00:25:48.08,00:25:48.08,We were just there. >> I'm packing my bags.
388,00:26:03.50,00:26:03.50,>> I'm for sure packing mine. >> I have a fair sense of
389,00:26:07.17,00:26:07.17,what's going on. There's five of us.
390,00:26:09.25,00:26:09.25,"We're, again, one big family. Natalie and I, we both looked"
391,00:26:12.33,00:26:12.33,at each other and said it's gonna be one of us.
392,00:26:15.17,00:26:15.17,"And it will be. I mean, at this point, we need"
393,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,"to continue to win, and it doesn't make sense to vote out"
394,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,one of the guys. My gut tells me maybe I'll
395,00:26:22.96,00:26:22.96,"stick around because I'm just competitively stronger, but my"
396,00:26:26.12,00:26:26.12,fate and Natalie's fate rest in the three guys in our tribe.
397,00:26:31.29,00:26:31.29,>> Your vote's very simple tonight.
398,00:26:34.62,00:26:34.62,">> What is it? >> It's Liz. And then, uh..."
399,00:26:37.42,00:26:37.42,>> She and I talked about it. >> And I'm... I'm trying my
400,00:26:41.62,00:26:41.62,best right now. Because you know you and Liz
401,00:26:45.25,00:26:45.25,"are the two names, of course. >> For sure. We knew that."
402,00:26:48.42,00:26:48.42,">> So, uh, 'cause I'm putting Liz, you putting Liz."
403,00:26:51.79,00:26:51.79,I know I can talk Mick into putting Liz no matter what.
404,00:26:55.08,00:26:55.08,">> I mean, no, she and I already talked."
405,00:26:56.96,00:26:56.96,"We know that it's pretty simple; I'm voting for her, and she's"
406,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,voting for me. >> Yeah.
407,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,>> How what? >> I'd like to stay if it's
408,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,possible. >> Every time that we come
409,00:27:32.83,00:27:32.83,"close to something good, it kind of gets taken away."
410,00:27:35.88,00:27:35.88,"So, winning today would have been our revenge, you know."
411,00:27:38.04,00:27:38.04,"They would have had to watch us eat and, you know, understand"
412,00:27:40.33,00:27:40.33,how we felt. And we were winning.
413,00:27:43.25,00:27:43.25,I think what's the most disheartening is not
414,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,"necessarily the losses, but just the random things that"
415,00:27:47.79,00:27:47.79,keep happening every time you think you have something good
416,00:27:50.04,00:27:50.04,"to go bad. And, you know, I really hope"
417,00:27:53.75,00:27:53.75,"Russell's okay. I mean, that, clearly, is the"
418,00:27:55.92,00:27:55.92,primary concern. I agree with the decision to
419,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,cancel the challenge and all that stuff.
420,00:27:59.42,00:27:59.42,"It just, uh, it just kind of sucks that when you finally"
421,00:28:02.33,00:28:02.33,"feel like you're getting in a groove and going someplace,"
422,00:28:04.79,00:28:04.79,"it's like, ""No, sorry."" >> Do you think we would have"
423,00:28:08.21,00:28:08.21,won that? >> I think we were winning
424,00:28:09.88,00:28:09.88,"by a lot. I'm just wondering, with all"
425,00:28:12.12,00:28:12.12,"the stars seeming to be aligned against us, how many of us"
426,00:28:16.04,00:28:16.04,"actually have a shot at getting real far, you know?"
427,00:28:19.67,00:28:19.67,">> Well, I mean, look at... >> This tribe could be done by"
428,00:28:23.29,00:28:23.29,"day 21, the rate we're going. >> I think it could be done."
429,00:28:28.08,00:28:28.08,I think it can be done. They'll have people flip
430,00:28:32.67,00:28:32.67,over there. >> I have a feeling that
431,00:28:47.42,00:28:47.42,"Shambo's going to be gunning for me, and so I want to be"
432,00:28:50.33,00:28:50.33,"sure that you have my back. >> Hold on, hold on."
433,00:28:53.12,00:28:53.12,Shh! Shh! Don't talk! Don't talk!
434,00:28:55.58,00:28:55.58,"They were all over, and they're probably up here,"
435,00:28:59.04,00:28:59.04,my crabs. >> Yeah.
436,00:29:01.67,00:29:01.67,">> If we were going to Tribal Council, right now, Shambo is"
437,00:29:04.17,00:29:04.17,"going, 100%. >> Here's a medium."
438,00:29:07.21,00:29:07.21,">> From day one, she's never really jelled with the tribe,"
439,00:29:10.12,00:29:10.12,and she's been over to the other tribe.
440,00:29:13.58,00:29:13.58,"None of us have. And so when we merge, she could"
441,00:29:17.79,00:29:17.79,"very easily flop sides. >> So what's, what's the"
442,00:29:21.38,00:29:21.38,"skinny, baby? We're voting somebody off"
443,00:29:22.96,00:29:22.96,"tonight. >> I don't know, honestly, who"
444,00:29:24.92,00:29:24.92,should go home. I don't know.
445,00:29:28.08,00:29:28.08,"I didn't, like, I honestly didn't think we'd come to like"
446,00:29:31.08,00:29:31.08,a second Tribal. I don't know.
447,00:29:32.88,00:29:32.88,">> Ever? >> I mean, I thought we would"
448,00:29:34.67,00:29:34.67,"go to the merge first. >> See, I'm just asking you guys"
449,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,to not write my name down today. >> Mm-hmm.
450,00:29:39.38,00:29:39.38,"I mean, I started the fire the first eight days we were here."
451,00:29:42.04,00:29:42.04,>> Yeah. >> Chief and I collected 100% of
452,00:29:44.08,00:29:44.08,the firewood the first eight days we were here.
453,00:29:47.04,00:29:47.04,"I have been a good competitor, an honest competitor,"
454,00:29:50.29,00:29:50.29,a fair competitor. I have not lied to anyone in
455,00:29:52.62,00:29:52.62,"this game. >> That's fine, but despite the"
456,00:29:54.96,00:29:54.96,"fact, my name got written down twice."
457,00:29:56.92,00:29:56.92,The only person here who wrote it down last Tribal was you.
458,00:30:00.83,00:30:00.83,">> So, you're writing my name down tonight?"
459,00:30:02.92,00:30:02.92,>> I don't know if I'm writing your name down.
460,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,I can't guarantee you anything. >> Who-who made fire for you the
461,00:30:07.29,00:30:07.29,"first eight days you were here, Monica?"
462,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,Who kept you warm and dry and safe?
463,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,>> Who didn't write my name down?
464,00:30:12.58,00:30:12.58,Everyone else in this tribe except for you!
465,00:30:15.25,00:30:15.25,"The number one reason for voting off Shambo, for me, is"
466,00:30:18.17,00:30:18.17,the fact she wrote my name down last time.
467,00:30:20.42,00:30:20.42,"And you got to take your enemy out the minute you can, and"
468,00:30:25.08,00:30:25.08,right now seems like an opportune moment.
469,00:30:31.33,00:30:31.33,">> As far as the weak girls go, who's the weakest girl?"
470,00:30:34.21,00:30:34.21,>> Monica. >> Totally!
471,00:30:35.38,00:30:35.38,>> Right? Bar none.
472,00:30:37.33,00:30:37.33,">> Yeah. >> And I'm sorry, as much as"
473,00:30:39.67,00:30:39.67,"people like to talk Shambo, we would not have won the fishing"
474,00:30:42.71,00:30:42.71,gear in that first immunity and started this whole ball rolling
475,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,without her. And she poses no threat
476,00:30:47.12,00:30:47.12,"to anybody. >> Exactly, exactly."
477,00:30:48.29,00:30:48.29,>> No threat. >> Exactly. None.
478,00:30:51.50,00:30:51.50,">> Post-merge, she does not have the power, the"
479,00:30:53.46,00:30:53.46,manipulative power that a Laura-Monica tag team or a
480,00:30:56.71,00:30:56.71,Laura or a Monica sole have. >> Voting Shambo off doesn't do
481,00:31:01.29,00:31:01.29,anything beneficial for any of us.
482,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,Monica needs to go for several reasons:
483,00:31:06.42,00:31:06.42,"one, Monica and Laura have this mother-daughter/sister-sister"
484,00:31:12.00,00:31:12.00,"relationship. Post-merge, that's gonna"
485,00:31:13.25,00:31:13.25,be dangerous. One of the two of them needs to
486,00:31:17.17,00:31:17.17,go while we still have a chance to get 'em.
487,00:31:20.38,00:31:20.38,Laura will be severely weakened without Monica.
488,00:31:23.54,00:31:23.54,"And Monica, I think, is the clear move because Monica"
489,00:31:28.17,00:31:28.17,doesn't help us win challenges at all.
490,00:31:30.29,00:31:30.29,Is there a better move than than that?
491,00:31:32.21,00:31:32.21,'Cause I can't think of any. >> This is not a bad plan.
492,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,">> So it's me, you, Brett, Dave makes four."
493,00:31:41.04,00:31:41.04,"Either Coach or Shambo come back, we have numbers;"
494,00:31:44.08,00:31:44.08,game over. No one flips.
495,00:31:52.08,00:31:52.08,>> Who else out here hasn't lied but me?
496,00:31:55.54,00:31:55.54,No one. Don't vote me off tonight.
497,00:31:57.42,00:31:57.42,">> Yeah, I know that about you, Sham, but I know... I know that"
498,00:32:01.88,00:32:01.88,"your effort speaks for itself. >> Obviously, it doesn't if"
499,00:32:04.54,00:32:04.54,you're not telling me you're not writing my name down.
500,00:32:06.96,00:32:06.96,>> Just 'cause I'm not telling you I'm not writing your name
501,00:32:09.04,00:32:09.04,down doesn't mean I'm not writing your name down.
502,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,>> Okay. >> Shambo is on a very
503,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,"need-to-know basis. Us four guys-- Dave, Brett, and"
504,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,John-- we're pretty good about keeping the plan within the
505,00:32:19.50,00:32:19.50,four of us. We're not gonna be telling
506,00:32:22.88,00:32:22.88,her anything more than what she needs to know.
507,00:32:26.17,00:32:26.17,>> So where you at tonight? >> What are your thoughts?
508,00:32:29.88,00:32:29.88,">> Erik, if you were Shambo, who would you vote for tonight?"
509,00:32:32.21,00:32:32.21,>> Yeah. >> Not me.
510,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,">> Not you. >> If I was Shambo, I would"
511,00:32:36.58,00:32:36.58,probably stay consistent. >> Who?
512,00:32:39.75,00:32:39.75,>> Consistent. I'd stay consistent.
513,00:32:41.67,00:32:41.67,>> Meaning who you voted for last time is probably your
514,00:32:44.12,00:32:44.12,best bet? >> You would stay consistent.
515,00:32:46.00,00:32:46.00,>> If I was Shambo. >> What if you were John?
516,00:32:50.25,00:32:50.25,">> Um, I would follow the leader; as in Shambo's"
517,00:32:56.88,00:32:56.88,the leader. >> Really?
518,00:32:58.21,00:32:58.21,"And if you were Erik, who would you vote for?"
519,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,>> I'd vote for Monica. >> Really?
520,00:33:03.58,00:33:03.58,">> Who are you voting for, Shambo?"
521,00:33:05.04,00:33:05.04,Do you get what this is about yet?
522,00:33:06.75,00:33:06.75,">> Yeah, I do. >> Mm-hmm."
523,00:33:07.75,00:33:07.75,">> Brett's down with it. >> He is? Okay, good."
524,00:33:10.12,00:33:10.12,>> Dave's down with it. And that's a wrap.
525,00:33:11.88,00:33:11.88,">> Okay, cool. >> Sham, you got to lock it up."
526,00:33:14.21,00:33:14.21,>> Lock it up. >> No worries.
527,00:33:16.54,00:33:16.54,"If that's what you want from me, that's what you've got."
528,00:33:18.96,00:33:18.96,>> And don't even-- Hounding at this is not locking it up.
529,00:33:43.08,00:33:43.08,">> PROBST: Well, this is a first-- 13 people at Tribal"
530,00:33:46.04,00:33:46.04,"Council. All right, let me give"
531,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,everybody an update. Russell was pulled from the
532,00:33:53.00,00:33:53.00,"game. After you guys left, the"
533,00:33:56.88,00:33:56.88,"doctors continued to monitor his blood pressure, blood"
534,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"pressure was steady. Two, three minutes in, out of"
535,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,"nowhere, his heart rate dropped like that."
536,00:34:07.58,00:34:07.58,"He blacked out again, went down on his back."
537,00:34:10.88,00:34:10.88,"At that point, there was no question he needed to be pulled"
538,00:34:14.04,00:34:14.04,from the game. It was the scariest moment I've
539,00:34:19.58,00:34:19.58,"ever had on this show. 19 seasons, I have never been"
540,00:34:23.62,00:34:23.62,more afraid in my life of how bad things were.
541,00:34:27.71,00:34:27.71,"Russell was in terrible shape. So, the update now is that he"
542,00:34:33.71,00:34:33.71,"is in very good hands, being monitored, doing fine."
543,00:34:37.58,00:34:37.58,There was no way he could have come back into the game.
544,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,"Shambo, what's your reaction to hearing that he's no longer in"
545,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,the game? >> I feel really sad that
546,00:34:46.54,00:34:46.54,"that's how he went out, because you see this guy with this"
547,00:34:50.62,00:34:50.62,amazing heart and spirit bigger than life.
548,00:34:55.38,00:34:55.38,"So, I mean, it's-- it's terribly sad."
549,00:34:58.25,00:34:58.25,">> PROBST: Russell, on one hand, it's a break for Foa Foa."
550,00:35:02.50,00:35:02.50,">> Yeah, he was definitely the strongest on their tribe."
551,00:35:05.71,00:35:05.71,"But I just don't like the fact that that's how he went out,"
552,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,"you know? I mean, if I was going to beat"
553,00:35:10.96,00:35:10.96,"him, I don't want to beat him like that."
554,00:35:13.25,00:35:13.25,">> PROBST: Dave, what does it say about this game, when"
555,00:35:16.12,00:35:16.12,you're watching not only somebody you're on a tribe
556,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67,"with, and you're also competing against, but just another human"
557,00:35:20.71,00:35:20.71,"being, going through this crisis?"
558,00:35:23.62,00:35:23.62,">> Well, you know, it's definitely an eye-opener for me."
559,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,"I mean, you get out here and it's like a whole different"
560,00:35:28.58,00:35:28.58,level that I did not expect. It's been raining for days.
561,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,We haven't been dry for more than an hour.
562,00:35:33.04,00:35:33.04,"It's pretty intense, easily the hardest thing I've ever done,"
563,00:35:36.42,00:35:36.42,and I've done a couple of hard things in my life.
564,00:35:39.04,00:35:39.04,">> PROBST: Erik, this has been 15 of the toughest days I've"
565,00:35:42.38,00:35:42.38,seen any group go through. >> I spent 22 hours in the
566,00:35:47.25,00:35:47.25,"bottom of a tree trunk, and with 22 hours, the inability to"
567,00:35:50.83,00:35:50.83,"sleep, you prayed about anything that you could think"
568,00:35:53.25,00:35:53.25,of. >> PROBST: Are you literally
569,00:35:54.92,00:35:54.92,praying? >> I prayed to God.
570,00:35:57.04,00:35:57.04,I prayed to Samoa. (thunder)
571,00:35:58.96,00:35:58.96,I prayed to... I don't know. I feel like I'm in solitary
572,00:36:02.38,00:36:02.38,"confinement for a crime I didn't commit, and that is not"
573,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,"anything that was advertised. >> PROBST: Shambo, what is it"
574,00:36:09.12,00:36:09.12,"that keeps you from saying, ""I'm going to quit?"""
575,00:36:11.92,00:36:11.92,>> I'm the 45-year-old lady here that-- that will not quit.
576,00:36:18.33,00:36:18.33,"(thunder) And I have been, like Erik,"
577,00:36:22.08,00:36:22.08,"shivering and praying-- ""Dear, God, this is Shannon from"
578,00:36:26.12,00:36:26.12,"Renton. Please, please, please let the"
579,00:36:28.00,00:36:28.00,"sun shine."" >> PROBST: And as we sit here,"
580,00:36:31.04,00:36:31.04,it is starting to pour once again.
581,00:36:34.08,00:36:34.08,">> Yup. >> You know, it's not just the"
582,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,"misery that the rain brings, but it's the constant fear, the"
583,00:36:40.54,00:36:40.54,constant torture that it's not going to stop.
584,00:36:44.12,00:36:44.12,"And every minute, you're terrified."
585,00:36:47.42,00:36:47.42,">> PROBST: Dave, first time we've had everybody here"
586,00:36:49.96,00:36:49.96,together. What's the status of the game
587,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"right now? >> Right now, it appears, you"
588,00:36:55.00,00:36:55.00,"know, just based on numbers, that Galu is ahead."
589,00:36:57.75,00:36:57.75,"And I don't know how their spirits are, but they haven't"
590,00:37:00.00,00:37:00.00,had quite the sustenance that we have.
591,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,"And I know that our spirits, in spite of the rain, are pretty"
592,00:37:04.92,00:37:04.92,"high. >> PROBST: Russell, Dave thinks"
593,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,Galu is winning right now. Not so good over here at Foa
594,00:37:11.38,00:37:11.38,Foa? >> Attitude at Foa Foa is-- is
595,00:37:15.17,00:37:15.17,fine. And I think they're going to be
596,00:37:20.25,00:37:20.25,shocked in the next couple of challenges because we can come
597,00:37:21.75,00:37:21.75,"back. We can even up them numbers,"
598,00:37:22.42,00:37:22.42,and then it will be a different story then.
599,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,">> PROBST: Mick, does today's challenge, even though we"
600,00:37:28.62,00:37:28.62,"didn't finish it, feel like a moral victory for Foa Foa?"
601,00:37:32.12,00:37:32.12,">> Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we have to take this as"
602,00:37:35.33,00:37:35.33,"a win. We feel like, at that point, we"
603,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,"were ahead, and so we'd like to think that it would have played"
604,00:37:41.33,00:37:41.33,"out and we would have won. >> PROBST: Erik, it's got to"
605,00:37:44.88,00:37:44.88,concern you a little bit. This group of five believes
606,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"they won today's challenge. >> well, they had a big win a"
607,00:37:51.54,00:37:51.54,few challenges ago. We came back and we brought it
608,00:37:53.96,00:37:53.96,"again. And now today, they got a tie,"
609,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,and that's supposed to make us nervous about a momentum shift?
610,00:38:02.50,00:38:02.50,"I don't think so. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
611,00:38:06.42,00:38:06.42,to the topic of the vote. Due to the unprecedented nature
612,00:38:11.42,00:38:11.42,"of today's events, in which, for the first time ever, we did"
613,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,"not complete a challenge, there will be no Tribal Council vote"
614,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,tonight. Nobody going home.
615,00:38:25.21,00:38:25.21,"Galu, you're not voting anybody out."
616,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,"Foa Foa, you will not vote anybody out."
617,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,I'm seeing a lot of mixed reactions.
618,00:38:33.29,00:38:33.29,Some happy people. And some jaws that are hitting
619,00:38:35.96,00:38:35.96,"the floor. Erik, is this good news?"
620,00:38:40.00,00:38:40.00,">> We lost a guy today. So, whether we're voting or not"
621,00:38:42.58,00:38:42.58,"voting, we're down already. So let's stop the bleeding at"
622,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,"one. >> PROBST: Russell, you guys"
623,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,would be down to four if you voted someone out tonight.
624,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,">> Yeah, I think it's the best news I heard all day, because"
625,00:38:53.38,00:38:53.38,"right now, us five, we're the strongest that we've ever been"
626,00:38:56.42,00:38:56.42,"this whole game. So now, if they beat us fair and"
627,00:38:59.58,00:38:59.58,"square, then we'll send somebody home."
628,00:39:01.62,00:39:01.62,But I really believe that the table's about to turn and I'll
629,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,"give 110% that it does, so I'm going to go all out."
630,00:39:11.04,00:39:11.04,">> PROBST: Erik, with every comment from Foa Foa about"
631,00:39:14.50,00:39:14.50,"""bring it,"" you're getting more and more forward."
632,00:39:17.08,00:39:17.08,>> Let's line it up and let's do a challenge right now.
633,00:39:20.83,00:39:20.83,"You know, because that's what Russell would do."
634,00:39:22.71,00:39:22.71,"He'd be saying, ""Are you kidding me?"
635,00:39:24.75,00:39:24.75,There's five of them over there and there are eight of us over
636,00:39:27.04,00:39:27.04,"here."" I don't know if there's emotion"
637,00:39:29.25,00:39:29.25,"in me that comes up, but every bead of sweat that he put into"
638,00:39:31.88,00:39:31.88,"everything he ever did, we're bringing that to you."
639,00:39:35.38,00:39:35.38,"We will bring that every day, every challenge."
640,00:39:39.17,00:39:39.17,">> We welcome it. >> PROBST: Well, it is clear"
641,00:39:44.33,00:39:44.33,that the events of today have only intensified the rivalry
642,00:39:48.42,00:39:48.42,between these two tribes. Foa Foa believes they've got a
643,00:39:52.17,00:39:52.17,"moral victory today, and now they can turn this game around."
644,00:39:55.71,00:39:55.71,"And Galu believing, ""Even though we lost Russell, his"
645,00:39:58.79,00:39:58.79,spirit is still with us and we will continue to dominate this
646,00:40:01.88,00:40:01.88,"game."" We're in store for a great"
647,00:40:04.08,00:40:04.08,finish. There is one order of
648,00:40:05.83,00:40:05.83,"business-- Galu, you are now without a leader."
649,00:40:08.42,00:40:08.42,"Somebody come grab this. When you get back to camp,"
650,00:40:11.08,00:40:11.08,assign a new leader. That concludes things for
651,00:40:20.88,00:40:20.88,"tonight. Foa Foa, grab your torches head"
652,00:40:23.08,00:40:23.08,"back to camp. Galu, grab your torches."
653,00:40:35.08,00:40:35.08,Head back to camp. Good night.
654,00:40:53.96,00:40:53.96,>> Being taken out of the game for medical reasons is the worst
655,00:40:57.29,00:40:57.29,"thing I've ever felt in my life. >> One, two, three, lift."
656,00:41:04.54,00:41:04.54,>> I played every minute to win this game.
657,00:41:08.62,00:41:08.62,And to have my body fail me is utterly demoralizing.
658,00:41:15.62,00:41:15.62,"But even though it pains me to not be in it, to do it and fail"
659,00:41:21.33,00:41:21.33,is better than to never try. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for
660,00:41:44.46,00:41:44.46,scenes from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
661,00:41:49.50,00:41:49.50,"Survivor: At Galu, the guys make Shambo one of their own."
662,00:41:52.33,00:41:52.33,>> Only strategic drawback is that Shambo is so dim that she
663,00:41:56.17,00:41:56.17,could screw up our plan. >> PROBST: And a Russell seed
664,00:41:59.21,00:41:59.21,gets planted in the other tribe. >> What I have to do now is
665,00:42:01.83,00:42:01.83,work my Houdini magic. >> What are we going to do?
666,00:42:03.88,00:42:03.88,"Go to the final two, the two of us?"
667,00:42:06.04,00:42:06.04,">> Final two. >> I'm really ashamed that, you"
668,00:42:12.71,00:42:12.71,"know, I'm not in the game anymore."
669,00:42:16.12,00:42:16.12,"And I'm angry, because I'm a fighter."
670,00:42:19.04,00:42:19.04,"But at the same time, I have to be realistic because I have to"
671,00:42:21.88,00:42:21.88,"get well, because I have an even bigger job to do, one that"
672,00:42:24.33,00:42:24.33,"I love, one they cherish every day."
673,00:42:27.17,00:42:27.17,And that's being a husband to my wife a father to my child.
