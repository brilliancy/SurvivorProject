46,00:03:38.63,00:03:38.63,The shelter is pitiful and it leaks every night.
47,00:03:41.70,00:03:41.70,Every one of us stink like rotten dogs.
48,00:03:46.03,00:03:46.03,"The challenges are going to become more mental, more"
49,00:03:49.57,00:03:49.57,"physical, more stressful. Camp life is hard, and as it"
50,00:03:54.20,00:03:54.20,"gets down to the last few days, it's getting harder every day."

52,00:04:10.93,00:04:10.93,"with the people that you're with,"

55,00:04:17.57,00:04:17.57,"you're hungry. You're not sleeping at night,"
56,00:04:20.00,00:04:20.00,"and it's just like, ""Shut up. Don't talk to me."""
57,00:04:24.23,00:04:24.23,>> But you got to know... they invited me... and I went
58,00:04:27.47,00:04:27.47,"down to eat with them, but I didn't play."
59,00:04:29.57,00:04:29.57,Take a little on the side. >> There was a brief
60,00:04:32.03,00:04:32.03,"time where I actually understood a couple words Big Tom said, but"
61,00:04:35.80,00:04:35.80,"for the most part, the entire time out here, I haven't"
62,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,understood him at all. He's not getting enough water
63,00:04:41.47,00:04:41.47,or something because he's just mumbling to himself.
64,00:04:43.90,00:04:43.90,( Tom mumbling ) >> Yeah.
65,00:04:49.90,00:04:49.90,He makes these unintelligible noises.
66,00:04:52.70,00:04:52.70,Nobody understands what he's saying.
67,00:05:08.70,00:05:08.70,>> Nice! The mother lode.
68,00:05:12.37,00:05:12.37,>> Jenna and I were gathering our coconuts and
69,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87,"sitting down, celebrating cracking open green coconuts"
70,00:05:17.37,00:05:17.37,and toasting to our victory over the darn coconut trees.
71,00:05:22.37,00:05:22.37,>> Okay. Here's what I want to talk to you about.
72,00:05:24.80,00:05:24.80,You or I have to win immunity next.
73,00:05:28.37,00:05:28.37,">> Yes. >> When we do, we vote"
74,00:05:30.27,00:05:30.27,"Boston Rob, okay? >> Right, we vote, we"
75,00:05:32.47,00:05:32.47,"vote Boston Rob, only because... When Jenna said, ""and we have to"
76,00:05:36.10,00:05:36.10,"beat Rob in immunity,"" I looked over and my heart sank because"
77,00:05:40.10,00:05:40.10,Rob was standing right there. >> Perfect.
78,00:05:51.80,00:05:51.80,">> We got to beat, we got to beat Big Tom."
79,00:05:54.20,00:05:54.20,>> He's annoying the crap out of us.
80,00:05:56.50,00:05:56.50,>> It's no big deal. >> What?
81,00:05:58.70,00:05:58.70,>> It's no big deal. >> It was a little scary
82,00:06:01.33,00:06:01.33,situation. Jenna already is full of
83,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33,paranoia and I don't need Rob to be full of paranoia.
84,00:06:08.40,00:06:08.40,Paranoia will destroy ya. >> Guess what.
85,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,">> What? >> We got problems,"
86,00:06:23.27,00:06:23.27,big problems. >> Okay.
87,00:06:26.60,00:06:26.60,">> I just walked up on, uh, Jenna and Rupert and they"
88,00:06:31.83,00:06:31.83,have no intention of going to the Final Four with us at all.
89,00:06:35.37,00:06:35.37,>> Did you confront them about it?
90,00:06:37.10,00:06:37.10,>> No. >> Are you going to?
91,00:06:38.90,00:06:38.90,>> No. >> I was under the
92,00:06:41.90,00:06:41.90,assumption that the game would be easier in the end because I
93,00:06:44.63,00:06:44.63,knew we had our strategy set in the beginning and that we
94,00:06:47.43,00:06:47.43,weren't really going to have to worry too much about it in the
95,00:06:50.53,00:06:50.53,"end, but I was completely wrong. So what do you think they want"
96,00:06:54.53,00:06:54.53,to get rid of next? >> Me.
97,00:06:56.70,00:06:56.70,Definitely. >> Of course I don't
98,00:06:59.10,00:06:59.10,"blame him-- he's worried. You know, if he is the target,"
99,00:07:01.83,00:07:01.83,"he's the next one to go, but, then I'm sure I'll be soon"
100,00:07:04.43,00:07:04.43,"after, but it's of our control right now."
101,00:07:22.37,00:07:22.37,">> I want it, too. >> PROBST: How we doing?"
102,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,>> Good. >> Good.
103,00:07:29.47,00:07:29.47,>> PROBST: Yeah? >> Happy to be here.
104,00:07:31.07,00:07:31.07,>> PROBST: Ready to hear about today's challenge?

194,00:12:51.80,00:12:51.80,"With only six days left, break from the game, a little food in"
195,00:12:54.63,00:12:54.63,"your belly, could have a big impact."
196,00:12:56.77,00:12:56.77,Here we go. Survivors ready.
197,00:13:00.80,00:13:00.80,Go! Boston Rob with a slight lead up
198,00:13:08.20,00:13:08.20,the ladder. Boston Rob almost takes a
199,00:13:14.60,00:13:14.60,tumble. Amber right behind.
200,00:13:38.67,00:13:38.67,"Boston Rob, no trouble at all. Show me those keys."
201,00:13:43.13,00:13:43.13,"Congratulations. You got yourself a truck, man."
202,00:13:51.23,00:13:51.23,>> Whoa! >> Good job.
203,00:13:52.60,00:13:52.60,>> I knew he had it. >> PROBST: Nice job.
204,00:14:02.53,00:14:02.53,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Ever had a new truck
205,00:14:04.47,00:14:04.47,before? >> First one.
206,00:14:05.83,00:14:05.83,>> PROBST: Really? >> Thank you very much.
207,00:14:07.30,00:14:07.30,">> PROBST: All right, so here's the deal."
208,00:14:08.73,00:14:08.73,"We're going to get in this truck, we're gonna drive down"
209,00:14:10.63,00:14:10.63,"the beach, we're gonna head over to the Survivor outdoor drive-in"
210,00:14:13.77,00:14:13.77,movie theater. >> Okay.
211,00:14:15.10,00:14:15.10,>> PROBST: Not going to be any fun by yourself.
212,00:14:17.60,00:14:17.60,One person coming with you. >> Got to be Amber.
213,00:14:20.47,00:14:20.47,">> PROBST: Really. >> Second place, and, uh..."
214,00:14:22.67,00:14:22.67,she's been with me from day one. >> PROBST: So it's Amber and
215,00:14:25.83,00:14:25.83,Boston Rob at the drive-in movie.
216,00:14:28.60,00:14:28.60,">> Sounds good, Jeff. >> PROBST: Let's get in."
217,00:14:30.70,00:14:30.70,You guys heading on back. >> Have a good night.
218,00:14:35.07,00:14:35.07,">> Y'all have a good night. >> PROBST: Boston Rob, you're"
219,00:14:37.80,00:14:37.80,"driving. Amber, hop in back, I'll take"
220,00:14:39.47,00:14:39.47,shotgun. >> I'm gonna get your
221,00:14:41.47,00:14:41.47,new truck all dirty. >> That's okay.
222,00:14:44.43,00:14:44.43,>> This is nice. >> PROBST: Let's hit it.
223,00:15:09.50,00:15:09.50,">> You know, anybody that's won a car during Survivor has"
224,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,"never actually won Survivor. Well, that wasn't going to"
225,00:15:16.37,00:15:16.37,"discourage me from winning. I'll tell you right now, it was"
226,00:15:19.37,00:15:19.37,worth it. >> Nicely done.
227,00:15:24.53,00:15:24.53,"Mariano, what up? This is a guy who knows his way"
228,00:15:28.57,00:15:28.57,"around a truck. Now that no one's around, nice"
229,00:15:35.60,00:15:35.60,"to have a rig? >> Oh, my God, this is"
230,00:15:37.47,00:15:37.47,beautiful. You can't really show the true
231,00:15:39.23,00:15:39.23,"emotion, you know, with everybody else standing there"
232,00:15:41.77,00:15:41.77,"going, ""You just won a new truck."""
233,00:15:43.30,00:15:43.30,">> PROBST: Right. So, here's the deal: got a snack"
234,00:15:45.50,00:15:45.50,"bar over here. It's full of juices, popcorn."
235,00:15:48.07,00:15:48.07,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Hot dogs, everything"
236,00:15:51.30,00:15:51.30,you guys need. Huge screen.
237,00:15:53.73,00:15:53.73,"You'll be watching Lord of the Flies, the movie that sort of"
238,00:15:56.07,00:15:56.07,inspired this show. And I think that's about it.
239,00:16:00.20,00:16:00.20,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, guys."
240,00:16:01.77,00:16:01.77,"Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, one more thing."
241,00:16:04.17,00:16:04.17,"There's one more thing. Uh, come with me."
242,00:16:07.63,00:16:07.63,One of the added benefits of being selected by Boston Rob...
243,00:16:11.33,00:16:11.33,"something for you, Amber. >> Oh, my God."
244,00:16:13.47,00:16:13.47,>> Shut up! Are you serious?!
245,00:16:17.27,00:16:17.27,"( screams ) >> PROBST: Amber, right here."
246,00:16:19.83,00:16:19.83,>> No! >> PROBST: Another new car.
247,00:16:21.77,00:16:21.77,Only this one's yours. >> Thank you.
248,00:16:26.20,00:16:26.20,"No! >> PROBST: Malibu Max, all"
249,00:16:28.73,00:16:28.73,yours. >> What goes around comes
250,00:16:32.00,00:16:32.00,"around, huh? >> PROBST: You look good in"
251,00:16:34.20,00:16:34.20,"there, Amber. So if you get tired of watching"
252,00:16:35.97,00:16:35.97,"it in the Colorado, you move into the Malibu Max and watch"
253,00:16:38.37,00:16:38.37,for a while. >> This is too much right now.
254,00:16:40.47,00:16:40.47,">> You just gave me a car, do you realize that?"
255,00:16:42.30,00:16:42.30,">> You earned it, you earned it."
256,00:16:44.00,00:16:44.00,>> AMBER ( screams ): Whoo! >> PROBST: Right on.
257,00:16:45.97,00:16:45.97,>> Yes! >> No way.
258,00:16:47.30,00:16:47.30,>> PROBST: Let's get the movie. ( honks horn )
259,00:16:50.67,00:16:50.67,>> I love it. I love it.
260,00:16:52.43,00:16:52.43,">> What's behind door number three, Jeff?"
261,00:16:54.33,00:16:54.33,">> Yeah! Oh, my God!"
262,00:16:58.17,00:16:58.17,I am so pumped. >> PROBST: Let's go watch a
263,00:17:01.03,00:17:01.03,movie. >> All right.
264,00:17:09.20,00:17:09.20,>> Time alone with Amber was unbelievable.
265,00:17:12.80,00:17:12.80,"For the first time, I didn't have to think about the game at"
266,00:17:16.13,00:17:16.13,all. >> I'd be miserable.
267,00:17:22.23,00:17:22.23,I can't really complain about my first date with Rob.
268,00:17:25.47,00:17:25.47,"You know, I was thinking about after the game, you know, I"
269,00:17:27.57,00:17:27.57,"wonder what we'll do-- probably go out to dinner, you know,"
270,00:17:29.73,00:17:29.73,"maybe go to the movies, maybe he'll bring me flowers,"
271,00:17:31.67,00:17:31.67,"who knows? But on our first date, yeah, we"
272,00:17:35.57,00:17:35.57,"did go to the movies, we did get some popcorn, and he gave me a"
273,00:17:39.27,00:17:39.27,"car instead of flowers. Let's see, flowers, a car,"
274,00:17:42.50,00:17:42.50,"flowers, a car, I'll take the car."
275,00:17:48.87,00:17:48.87,We're going to eat at least two more hot dogs time each.
276,00:17:52.87,00:17:52.87,Two or three >> Amber's definitely
277,00:18:01.93,00:18:01.93,"special to me, a lot more special than when we started"
278,00:18:04.40,00:18:04.40,"this adventure. But, I mean, still, you can't"
279,00:18:07.87,00:18:07.87,lose sight of the fact that you're playing a game for a
280,00:18:09.93,00:18:09.93,million dollars. I'm not going to forfeit the
281,00:18:12.33,00:18:12.33,"million to anybody, including her."
282,00:18:24.63,00:18:24.63,>> I would love it if they brought us back some food.
283,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,">> I don't believe that. >> Every time I've won,"
284,00:18:30.53,00:18:30.53,"I've brought back pocketfuls of food, piece of candy or"
285,00:18:34.80,00:18:34.80,something would be nice. >> When you come back
286,00:18:39.33,00:18:39.33,"from reward challenges, you always feel guilty."
287,00:18:42.17,00:18:42.17,"So to come back from another reward challenge with a car,"
288,00:18:46.90,00:18:46.90,it was pretty rough. Hi.
289,00:18:48.93,00:18:48.93,>> Hey. How was the movie?
290,00:18:51.93,00:18:51.93,>> Brought some stuff back for you.
291,00:18:53.47,00:18:53.47,>> Some candy. >> It was good.
292,00:18:55.23,00:18:55.23,>> Beautiful. >> We want to tell you
293,00:18:57.80,00:18:57.80,"all about it... well, if you want to hear."
294,00:18:59.50,00:18:59.50,If you don't want to hear... I had the choice whether or not
295,00:19:02.83,00:19:02.83,"to tell people that I had won the car, but I felt that holding"
296,00:19:06.30,00:19:06.30,that back from them just wasn't me.
297,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,"We were getting ready to start the movie and Jeff goes, ""Oh,"
298,00:19:13.70,00:19:13.70,"wait, hold on, hold on, I totally forgot, we have one"
299,00:19:15.93,00:19:15.93,"more thing."" And me and Rob are like ""What?"""
300,00:19:18.80,00:19:18.80,"He goes, ""One of the luxuries of being chosen as the one person"
301,00:19:23.10,00:19:23.10,"to go on the drive-in date is that they also get something,"
302,00:19:25.37,00:19:25.37,"too."" And we start walking back and"
303,00:19:27.73,00:19:27.73,there's another car. And they gave me a car.
304,00:19:30.63,00:19:30.63,">> Man. >> Unbelievable, right?"
305,00:19:32.60,00:19:32.60,">> Very, very cool. >> Huh?"
306,00:19:36.77,00:19:36.77,>> I was flipping out. >> I was completely
307,00:19:40.70,00:19:40.70,shocked. >> We were shocked.
308,00:19:44.43,00:19:44.43,"I'm still freaking out about it. Like, every five minutes I go,"
309,00:19:47.30,00:19:47.30,"""Rob, you gave me a car."" >> They won a car"
310,00:19:51.90,00:19:51.90,apiece. They brought back pockets full
311,00:19:54.27,00:19:54.27,"of candy, and split them up into five piles."
312,00:19:57.77,00:19:57.77,They took their share after eating dogs and candy.
313,00:20:01.20,00:20:01.20,"""I saved my candy."" Well, it's easy to save your"
314,00:20:03.70,00:20:03.70,damn candy when you've got a belly full... and a new car!
315,00:20:09.83,00:20:09.83,">> How old are you, are you 18? >> I'm a good Catholic girl."
316,00:20:13.63,00:20:13.63,>> Good Catholic girls are pretty sexy.
317,00:20:17.50,00:20:17.50,>> I know. Take your hat off.
318,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,>> If there is a Survivor hex that keeps the car
319,00:20:25.97,00:20:25.97,"winners from winning the game, I would love that."
320,00:20:30.77,00:20:30.77,That would be my little justice. And I win the million.
321,00:20:42.90,00:20:42.90,">> Oh, so nice. >> If we want to have a"
322,00:21:02.40,00:21:02.40,"fire at all, we're going to have to have some wood."
323,00:21:05.20,00:21:05.20,"After a while, I'll go get us some fish."
324,00:21:07.20,00:21:07.20,This is the first night with not very much sleep and very little
325,00:21:12.37,00:21:12.37,help. It makes me crazy to watch Rob
326,00:21:18.27,00:21:18.27,"and Amber sit on their butts, and then when challenge comes"
327,00:21:21.83,00:21:21.83,"up, they have amazing amounts of energy."
328,00:21:32.43,00:21:32.43,>> Where's Rup? Do you see him out there?
329,00:21:34.83,00:21:34.83,">> He was standing on the rock, so I actually saw him..."
330,00:21:37.17,00:21:37.17,>> I think he and Tom were up there.
331,00:21:42.87,00:21:42.87,">> You know, if you don't win immunity, you're fifth out."
332,00:21:46.00,00:21:46.00,">> Well, they're going to do something."
333,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,">> If you win immunity, are you going to put your only"
334,00:21:50.73,00:21:50.73,worker out of this tribe or are you going to band with me and
335,00:21:54.57,00:21:54.57,put Rob out? Break that damn couple and break
336,00:21:58.30,00:21:58.30,"that couple apart. >> You know, everybody on"
337,00:22:03.40,00:22:03.40,the tribe has tried to change my mind for the last two or three
338,00:22:06.80,00:22:06.80,"weeks. I've entertained the thought,"
339,00:22:08.63,00:22:08.63,"you know, that I also am playing the game, you know."
340,00:22:11.83,00:22:11.83,"I want to win, too. I mean, I'm not going to lay"
341,00:22:14.20,00:22:14.20,"dead and let everybody just run over me, which I have been most"
342,00:22:16.50,00:22:16.50,"of the game. If we don't get Rob off, he's"
343,00:22:18.50,00:22:18.50,won. >> If we don't get Rob
344,00:22:21.57,00:22:21.57,"off, what? >> He's won."
345,00:22:24.47,00:22:24.47,>> He's won? If I get Tom in with Jenna and
346,00:22:27.70,00:22:27.70,"I, we three would be the power in this five and put Rob and"
347,00:22:32.13,00:22:32.13,Amber out of this game. I think I'm going to go try to
348,00:22:39.63,00:22:39.63,get us a couple of fish early. Are you hungry?
349,00:22:43.17,00:22:43.17,"No? >> At this point, there's"
350,00:22:47.77,00:22:47.77,no guarantee that Tom's going to stay loyal.
351,00:22:50.00,00:22:50.00,"I can't trust anybody, so pretty much what I did was I instigated"
352,00:22:53.60,00:22:53.60,Big Tom to start a fight with Rupert.
353,00:22:58.90,00:22:58.90,"Maybe he's trying to play both sides or something, but"
354,00:23:01.50,00:23:01.50,he keeps telling that you keep saying you want to vote me out.
355,00:23:05.10,00:23:05.10,>> I won't change alliance. >> Huh?
356,00:23:08.33,00:23:08.33,">> I won't change alliance. Well, how could I?"
357,00:23:10.47,00:23:10.47,>> I don't know. >> It would be stupid of me.
358,00:23:14.53,00:23:14.53,"Think-- why, why should I change alliance that's carried me all"
359,00:23:18.93,00:23:18.93,the way through? I won't change.
360,00:23:21.80,00:23:21.80,"I mean, I won't change. >> Why would he say that"
361,00:23:25.20,00:23:25.20,if it wasn't true? >> That's what I'm saying.
362,00:23:27.30,00:23:27.30,"I think Rupert has been a truthful man, but if he told you"
363,00:23:29.17,00:23:29.17,"that... >> Yeah, he told me that."
364,00:23:31.63,00:23:31.63,">> Well, then he's a lying son of a bitch."
365,00:23:33.50,00:23:33.50,I told Rob from the beginning I was going to stick with him all
366,00:23:36.20,00:23:36.20,"the way through, but this fifth- and sixth-grade tattletale"
367,00:23:39.43,00:23:39.43,"stuff, you know, I mean, I take it personal, and I ain't happy"
368,00:23:43.53,00:23:43.53,"about it. >> You know me, Tom, I've"
369,00:23:45.43,00:23:45.43,been straight since the beginning.
370,00:23:47.13,00:23:47.13,">> The very beginning. >> Since day one, day two,"
371,00:23:49.37,00:23:49.37,whatever the hell it was. I'd want to confront him.
372,00:23:52.73,00:23:52.73,Or you want him to just chump you like that?
373,00:23:57.40,00:23:57.40,"Sooner than later, it was like two cats in a bag going at it."
374,00:24:03.53,00:24:03.53,">> You telling him that you want me to vote Rob off, that's"
375,00:24:06.97,00:24:06.97,"what he's saying, that was my game plan."
376,00:24:09.37,00:24:09.37,>> You didn't tell me that we needed to get Rob off?
377,00:24:11.93,00:24:11.93,>> Rob... >> Did you or did you
378,00:24:14.33,00:24:14.33,not tell me we needed to get Rob off?
379,00:24:16.37,00:24:16.37,>> Yeah. Let me tell you. I'm just saying...
380,00:24:17.63,00:24:17.63,>> Did you or did you not tell me we needed to get Rob
381,00:24:20.00,00:24:20.00,off? You was tired of watching him
382,00:24:21.90,00:24:21.90,sitting down and you needed to get Rob off and you was
383,00:24:23.93,00:24:23.93,sorry you made an alliance with him.
384,00:24:25.63,00:24:25.63,Did you not tell me that? >> The reason did I this
385,00:24:29.37,00:24:29.37,was get them at each other's throats so that neither of them
386,00:24:32.07,00:24:32.07,will have enough sense to go to each other and try to get me and
387,00:24:35.00,00:24:35.00,"Amber off, and I think I succeeded."
388,00:24:37.03,00:24:37.03,>> Why would I want to get Rob off when I've had an
389,00:24:39.13,00:24:39.13,alliance with him the whole time?
390,00:24:41.13,00:24:41.13,You didn't even know I had an alliance.
391,00:24:42.90,00:24:42.90,>> Of course I knew you had an alliance with him.
392,00:24:44.73,00:24:44.73,You told me you had an alliance with him.
393,00:24:46.73,00:24:46.73,I also know you didn't want to go to the final two with him.
394,00:24:48.67,00:24:48.67,>> I would... that is our alliance.
395,00:24:51.63,00:24:51.63,">> Good! >> Well, then... then fine."
396,00:24:54.07,00:24:54.07,>> You shouldn't sit back there and be talking bad
397,00:24:56.37,00:24:56.37,about him. Rob is playing this game so hard
398,00:25:00.23,00:25:00.23,"now, I know that that was all a ploy to try and make me look"
399,00:25:04.40,00:25:04.40,bad. That's fine.
400,00:25:07.60,00:25:07.60,"I stood up, I told Big Tom what's what."
401,00:25:10.70,00:25:10.70,">> All I'm saying, you running like a damn scared hound"
402,00:25:13.23,00:25:13.23,"to tell Rob something. Now, is... now, that's playing"
403,00:25:16.47,00:25:16.47,straight up? >> You've been talking
404,00:25:18.67,00:25:18.67,"about getting rid of everybody, Tom, behind everybody's back and"
405,00:25:21.33,00:25:21.33,"now I'm the bad guy? >> PROBST: What's going on,"
406,00:25:33.20,00:25:33.20,guys? Day 36.
407,00:25:42.07,00:25:42.07,The sun is out. About the only thing that would
408,00:25:44.83,00:25:44.83,make this day any better is having immunity around your neck
409,00:25:48.17,00:25:48.17,"at end of the day. Big Tom, I've got to get it"
410,00:25:50.20,00:25:50.20,"back. Once again, immunity back up for"
411,00:26:00.57,00:26:00.57,"grabs. Today's immunity challenge,"
412,00:26:02.40,00:26:02.40,pretty simple. It is a word scramble.
413,00:26:05.07,00:26:05.07,Your job is find the 17 tribe names from the last eight
414,00:26:09.13,00:26:09.13,seasons that are hidden in the scramble.
415,00:26:11.40,00:26:11.40,Once you've found all 17 names you'll unscramble the
416,00:26:14.33,00:26:14.33,intersecting letter to spell out one final mystery word.
417,00:26:18.30,00:26:18.30,"First person to finish wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in"
418,00:26:23.43,00:26:23.43,the Final Four. Nothing more important in this
419,00:26:26.63,00:26:26.63,"game right now. Nobody wants to come out here,"
420,00:26:29.47,00:26:29.47,spend 36 days to go home fifth. Just doesn't sound good.
421,00:26:33.73,00:26:33.73,"Okay, we'll randomly draw colors, wait for my go."
422,00:26:42.93,00:26:42.93,For immunity: survivors ready? Go.
423,00:26:52.27,00:26:52.27,>> Jenna with her first word right off the bat.
424,00:26:58.43,00:26:58.43,Big Tom with one. >> Rupert using the tried and
425,00:27:05.87,00:27:05.87,true method. He's got two.
426,00:27:15.63,00:27:15.63,"As you get a word, mark it off your list so you know."
427,00:27:27.93,00:27:27.93,Boston Rob has seven. Amber with eight.
428,00:27:38.60,00:27:38.60,Rupert with six. Big Tom with seven.
429,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17,"Jenna gets another word, she's got nine."
430,00:27:57.43,00:27:57.43,>> Amber still in the lead with 11.
431,00:27:59.33,00:27:59.33,Boston Rob right behind with ten.
432,00:28:01.50,00:28:01.50,"Remember, guys, you're looking for the names of 17 past"
433,00:28:03.73,00:28:03.73,"Survivor tribes, and you're going to unscramble the"
434,00:28:06.47,00:28:06.47,intersecting letters and spell out one final word.
435,00:28:19.77,00:28:19.77,Big Tom catching up. He's at ten.
436,00:28:27.03,00:28:27.03,"Amber up to 15. Boston Rob picking it up,"
437,00:28:33.47,00:28:33.47,closing in at 14. Rupert with 12.
438,00:28:49.00,00:28:49.00,Slowly gaining. Amber has all her words.
439,00:28:52.40,00:28:52.40,Starting to unscramble intersecting letters trying to
440,00:28:54.27,00:28:54.27,come up with that final mystery word.
441,00:28:56.50,00:28:56.50,"Don't give up, guys. Everybody's still in it."
442,00:28:59.87,00:28:59.87,Jenna at 13. Big Tom with 15; looking for two
443,00:29:08.60,00:29:08.60,"more. Everybody fighting, everybody"
444,00:29:12.57,00:29:12.57,wants immunity. Amber still trying to figure out
445,00:29:16.00,00:29:16.00,that mystery word. >> Rupert with another word.
446,00:29:20.27,00:29:20.27,He's got 14. Boston Rob moves up to 16.
447,00:29:31.90,00:29:31.90,Big Tom moves up to 16. He only needs one more.
448,00:29:38.23,00:29:38.23,">> Got 'em all, Jeff. Boston Rob with all 17"
449,00:29:41.30,00:29:41.30,"thinks he has the mystery word. ""Chabogo Mogo."""
450,00:29:43.90,00:29:43.90,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Boston Rob wins
451,00:29:46.27,00:29:46.27,immunity! Boston Rob.
452,00:29:53.20,00:29:53.20,"I know everybody wanted it, but only one of you gets it."
453,00:29:56.83,00:29:56.83,Nicely done. >> Thank you.
454,00:29:59.43,00:29:59.43,">> PROBST: Safe from the vote, guaranteed a spot in the Final"
455,00:30:04.37,00:30:04.37,"For the others, not the same good news."
456,00:30:07.50,00:30:07.50,Tonight the game will end for one of you.
457,00:30:09.57,00:30:09.57,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
458,00:30:11.73,00:30:11.73,See you guys tonight at Tribal Council.
459,00:30:37.00,00:30:37.00,>> I want to wear that damn necklace one time before
460,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,we leave. >> I think you put a hex on it.
461,00:30:41.67,00:30:41.67,You put a hex on that thing. >> Coming back with the
462,00:30:45.97,00:30:45.97,"necklace on puts me in a good position, but it's also a"
463,00:30:48.73,00:30:48.73,"precarious position, because I hold the power."
464,00:30:52.07,00:30:52.07,"The only way I don't hold the power is if Rupert, Jenna and"
465,00:30:55.50,00:30:55.50,Big Tom all team up and vote Amber off.
466,00:30:58.33,00:30:58.33,That's the only way I don't hold any power.
467,00:31:01.57,00:31:01.57,"Whether they actually realize that or not, I don't know, and"
468,00:31:04.90,00:31:04.90,"right now I'm kind of just being the diplomat, sitting"
469,00:31:08.00,00:31:08.00,"back, listening to what everybody has to say and"
470,00:31:11.13,00:31:11.13,thinking about my options. >> I just want to say
471,00:31:14.33,00:31:14.33,"congratulations, and I want to apologize for having a"
472,00:31:18.10,00:31:18.10,misunderstanding earlier. >> Big Tom is definitely
473,00:31:21.77,00:31:21.77,scrambling. He knows that Rob and I are
474,00:31:24.50,00:31:24.50,"not 100% with him, and he knows that he's a swing vote"
475,00:31:27.43,00:31:27.43,right now. He knows that he could hop
476,00:31:29.27,00:31:29.27,over with Rupert and Jenna right now and get rid of me if
477,00:31:31.00,00:31:31.00,they wanted to. Everybody's talking and
478,00:31:33.37,00:31:33.37,everybody's paranoid. >> Everybody's paranoid
479,00:31:35.37,00:31:35.37,"about the vote tonight, that's all."
480,00:31:37.23,00:31:37.23,">> I made an agreement with y'all, if you all want to"
481,00:31:39.83,00:31:39.83,"break it, break it. >> I don't have an"
482,00:31:41.40,00:31:41.40,"immunity necklace around my neck, so you can't blame me"
483,00:31:43.10,00:31:43.10,for being paranoid and being worried.
484,00:31:45.03,00:31:45.03,">> Well, we've all questioned me, now we'll see"
485,00:31:47.03,00:31:47.03,"when it comes to voting, who's questioning who."
486,00:31:49.03,00:31:49.03,>> Who do you think? If you had to pick one or the
487,00:31:51.00,00:31:51.00,other? >> He wants Jenna gone.
488,00:31:53.27,00:31:53.27,>> You want Jenna gone? >> I think Jenna's brain
489,00:31:55.50,00:31:55.50,is better than Rupert's. >> There's so much
490,00:32:06.03,00:32:06.03,"paranoia, but at the same time, I've trusted in this"
491,00:32:09.47,00:32:09.47,alliance with Boston Rob and Amber and it's worked out
492,00:32:11.97,00:32:11.97,exactly how we planned from day 12.
493,00:32:14.97,00:32:14.97,That's insane that this alliance has held up through
494,00:32:17.47,00:32:17.47,"that whole thing, so I keep thinking something has to go"
495,00:32:19.47,00:32:19.47,wrong. >> Want to flip a coin?
496,00:32:30.33,00:32:30.33,"Because that's how I feel about this right now, and I"
497,00:32:34.57,00:32:34.57,"know as stupid as that sounds with strategy, like, I feel"
498,00:32:38.07,00:32:38.07,like I've been going through it a million times in my mind.
499,00:32:44.63,00:32:44.63,Hey. >> Hey what?
500,00:32:48.80,00:32:48.80,>> Come up here. Let's be honest with each
501,00:32:54.97,00:32:54.97,"other, if we can be honest for one time, let's see if we can."
502,00:32:59.13,00:32:59.13,Have you or have you not tried to mark me to get me kicked
503,00:33:03.03,00:33:03.03,out of this game? >> Absolutely not.
504,00:33:05.80,00:33:05.80,"You marked yourself every time you won, and I have not..."
505,00:33:09.40,00:33:09.40,>> And you haven't gone to anybody and said we need to
506,00:33:12.37,00:33:12.37,"get him off? >> No, no, sir, no, sir."
507,00:33:15.27,00:33:15.27,>> Where does our alliance stand now?
508,00:33:17.03,00:33:17.03,"Let me ask you that. We take out Jenna tonight,"
509,00:33:19.43,00:33:19.43,then what happens? Then we take out Rupert?
510,00:33:22.40,00:33:22.40,>> I don't know. You tell me.
511,00:33:25.27,00:33:25.27,>> Why do I have to tell you?
512,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,">> Because I'm the pawn. I told you, I'm the swing"
513,00:33:29.70,00:33:29.70,"vote. >> No, you're with us,"
514,00:33:32.03,00:33:32.03,"there is no swing. We're a group, there's no"
515,00:33:34.07,00:33:34.07,swing. >> Jenna and Rupert are
516,00:33:36.23,00:33:36.23,two. All they need is one to get
517,00:33:38.77,00:33:38.77,"smashed. >> Right, and you wanted"
518,00:33:41.13,00:33:41.13,to be that one. >> Why would you think
519,00:33:43.03,00:33:43.03,I'd want with Rupert and Jenna.
520,00:33:44.10,00:33:44.10,>> I don't know. Why you been feeding them
521,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,stuff for the last two weeks telling them you want to get rid
522,00:33:47.57,00:33:47.57,"of me? >> Come on, guys..."
523,00:33:49.13,00:33:49.13,>> There's way too many stories going around.
524,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,>> That's what I'm saying.
525,00:33:52.63,00:33:52.63,"Hey, listen, we're like seventh graders here."
526,00:33:54.60,00:33:54.60,>> I don't care about anything that's happened in
527,00:33:56.97,00:33:56.97,the past. I told you that I'll vote with
528,00:33:59.23,00:33:59.23,"you and I'm going to vote with you, so we're trying to figure"
529,00:34:02.03,00:34:02.03,"out who to vote on, if it should be Jenna or Rupert."
530,00:34:04.37,00:34:04.37,">> I like Rupert, but boy that was a low-life thing that"
531,00:34:07.47,00:34:07.47,he done. It's taken me a little while
532,00:34:09.60,00:34:09.60,"to get over it. Jenna, she's an all right"
533,00:34:12.00,00:34:12.00,"girl, but she's a motor mouth. All she is is mouth, and she's"
534,00:34:15.33,00:34:15.33,smart enough to get... she's smart enough to 'cause
535,00:34:18.13,00:34:18.13,"trouble. But, y'all, let's make up our"
536,00:34:20.77,00:34:20.77,"mind, because when you tell me, that's what I'm putting on"
537,00:34:23.57,00:34:23.57,that card. >> That's it. Let's do it.
538,00:34:25.80,00:34:25.80,">> Let's do it, it's Jenna... Jenna."
539,00:34:35.00,00:34:35.00,>> There's no decision that could be made right now
540,00:34:37.67,00:34:37.67,that I would feel 100% sure about.
541,00:34:40.07,00:34:40.07,I hate being put in this position.
542,00:34:42.03,00:34:42.03,It's a million dollar decision.
543,00:34:43.77,00:34:43.77,">> Very sensitive today, huh?"
544,00:34:45.83,00:34:45.83,>> It's because... You don't understand.
545,00:34:47.30,00:34:47.30,I can taste the money. Do you realize how close we
546,00:34:48.90,00:34:48.90,are? >> Yeah.
547,00:34:50.87,00:34:50.87,>> Of course I'm stressed. It's a million dollars.
548,00:34:52.90,00:34:52.90,It's going to change our lives. >> That's right.
549,00:34:55.90,00:34:55.90,"We're going to be okay. >> Tonight, Tribal"
550,00:34:58.57,00:34:58.57,Council is going to be the ugliest Tribal Council we've
551,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40,had yet. >> PROBST: Now I'll bring in
552,00:35:29.87,00:35:29.87,"the members of our jury-- Lex, Kathy, Alicia and Shii Ann,"
553,00:35:35.37,00:35:35.37,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
554,00:35:43.03,00:35:43.03,"Well, you've lasted 36 days, and yet, for one of you, this"
555,00:35:47.63,00:35:47.63,game is only moments away from being over.
556,00:35:50.67,00:35:50.67,"So, let's talk about the status of camp."
557,00:35:53.40,00:35:53.40,"Rupert, were things peaceful? What happened?"
558,00:35:56.63,00:35:56.63,">> Things weren't... things weren't peaceful, you"
559,00:35:58.83,00:35:58.83,know? There's some alliances being
560,00:36:01.47,00:36:01.47,"tested, you know? It's getting down to the end."
561,00:36:04.53,00:36:04.53,"There's five of us here that want to be the Final Two, you"
562,00:36:07.17,00:36:07.17,know? It's just getting kind of
563,00:36:09.60,00:36:09.60,"hard. >> PROBST: Suspicion setting in,"
564,00:36:12.17,00:36:12.17,"Amber, is probably inevitable. Did you sense it today?"
565,00:36:15.57,00:36:15.57,>> It's huge. Today I sensed suspicion the
566,00:36:18.57,00:36:18.57,"worst yet, and I'm starting to get really anxious, really"
567,00:36:21.63,00:36:21.63,nervous. Today I think was probably the
568,00:36:24.13,00:36:24.13,"most stressful day for me yet. Um, I can smell the money it's"
569,00:36:26.90,00:36:26.90,"so close. >> PROBST: Jenna, Amber just"
570,00:36:30.07,00:36:30.07,"made a pretty honest comment, ""I can smell the money."""
571,00:36:33.77,00:36:33.77,I'm sure all of you can get a whiff of it at this point.
572,00:36:37.13,00:36:37.13,>> That's all you can do at this point.
573,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,"With three days left, that's all you live, breathe..."
574,00:36:41.33,00:36:41.33,"I mean, you're no longer craving food, you're no longer"
575,00:36:43.40,00:36:43.40,caring if you sleep-- the game is everything.
576,00:36:46.13,00:36:46.13,">> PROBST: So, Boston Rob, is it inevitable that it's always"
577,00:36:48.83,00:36:48.83,going to come down to this at some point?
578,00:36:51.57,00:36:51.57,">> In the end, you're always going to have some"
579,00:36:53.97,00:36:53.97,people that are playing a little bit harder than others.
580,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,You're going to have some people where the paranoia
581,00:36:59.40,00:36:59.40,"starts to set in, people start to scramble, people start to"
582,00:37:02.73,00:37:02.73,get caught in their lies. >> PROBST: Did you notice
583,00:37:05.20,00:37:05.20,somebody getting caught in a lie?
584,00:37:07.43,00:37:07.43,>> I noticed a couple of people getting caught on a
585,00:37:09.47,00:37:09.47,couple lies. All I can say is I'm happy
586,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,that I'm wearing this necklace tonight.
587,00:37:14.23,00:37:14.23,">> PROBST: Amber, what are you basing your vote on tonight?"
588,00:37:16.57,00:37:16.57,">> Tonight, and for pretty much the very first"
589,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,"time, I'm going completely with my gut."
590,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,I think tonight's vote is extremely important.
591,00:37:25.13,00:37:25.13,I keep going back and forth in my head wondering what the
592,00:37:28.20,00:37:28.20,"best decision is, and the only thing that I trust right now"
593,00:37:31.37,00:37:31.37,"is my gut, so I'm just going to go with my gut."
594,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,">> PROBST: Big Tom, how insulted would you be if it is you"
595,00:37:37.37,00:37:37.37,tonight and you've been betrayed?
596,00:37:39.50,00:37:39.50,">> You know what? ""Et, tu, Brute."""
597,00:37:41.93,00:37:41.93,"Even Jesus said it. ""Even you, Peter, betray me."""
598,00:37:45.53,00:37:45.53,"And you know what? If that's the case, I don't"
599,00:37:48.07,00:37:48.07,"have to live with it, they'll have to live with it, because"
600,00:37:50.57,00:37:50.57,I get to sit in that jury and decide-- was I done fairly?
601,00:37:55.97,00:37:55.97,">> PROBST: Jenna, if it's you, is this okay at 36 days?"
602,00:37:59.13,00:37:59.13,Not bad. >> Not good enough.
603,00:38:01.57,00:38:01.57,"Um, I came out the second time to play the game to win, and I"
604,00:38:05.20,00:38:05.20,"would be upset if I was voted off tonight, because it meant"
605,00:38:08.73,00:38:08.73,"that a lot of people lied, and that's, I mean, that's a big"
606,00:38:12.27,00:38:12.27,"deal. >> PROBST: Boston Rob, you have"
607,00:38:14.50,00:38:14.50,"immunity, I assume you're not giving it up."
608,00:38:16.87,00:38:16.87,>> No. >> PROBST: Boston Rob is the
609,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,"only person you cannot vote for, everybody else is"
610,00:38:20.77,00:38:20.77,vulnerable. It is time to vote.
611,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,"Big Tom, you're up. >> Pony ride's over."
612,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,You're welcome for carrying you this far.
613,00:39:12.13,00:39:12.13,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
614,00:39:26.30,00:39:26.30,>> PROBST: Once the votes are read the decision is final.
615,00:39:29.53,00:39:29.53,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
616,00:39:31.57,00:39:31.57,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
617,00:39:34.10,00:39:34.10,First vote... Jenna. Tom.
618,00:39:44.23,00:39:44.23,"Tommy. One vote Jenna, two votes Big"
619,00:39:46.63,00:39:46.63,Tom. The 14th person voted out of
620,00:39:53.00,00:39:53.00,"Survivor: All Stars, and the fifth member of our jury, Big"
621,00:39:55.50,00:39:55.50,"Tom. That's three votes, that's"
622,00:39:57.47,00:39:57.47,enough. You need to bring me your
623,00:39:59.47,00:39:59.47,"torch. Big Tom, the tribe has spoken."
624,00:40:07.60,00:40:07.60,>> I heard it. >> PROBST: It's time for you to
625,00:40:10.30,00:40:10.30,"go. >> PROBST: Well, you lasted 36"
626,00:40:32.53,00:40:32.53,"days, you made it to the Final Four."
627,00:40:34.73,00:40:34.73,"Once again, judging from tonight's vote, it is clearly"
628,00:40:37.60,00:40:37.60,"anybody's game. Grab your torches, head back"
