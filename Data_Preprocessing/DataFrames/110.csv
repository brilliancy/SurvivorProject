1,00:00:01.97,00:00:01.97,   ANNOUNCER: 16 Americans marooned   for 39 days
2,00:00:05.43,00:00:05.43, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:08.37,00:00:08.37,"  Separated into two tribes, Tagi and Pagong"
4,00:00:11.47,00:00:11.47,  they competed against each other to remain on the island.
5,00:00:14.43,00:00:14.43,  But now the tribes  have merged into one.
6,00:00:16.80,00:00:16.80," Rattana is the name, and it is    everyone for themselves."
7,00:00:20.80,00:00:20.80,  Every third night
8,00:00:22.30,00:00:22.30,  the entire tribe will hike  deep into the jungle
9,00:00:24.87,00:00:24.87, to take part  in the tribal council
10,00:00:26.83,00:00:26.83,  where they must vote one  of their own off the island.
11,00:00:30.43,00:00:30.43,"  In the end, one will remain"
12,00:00:32.67,00:00:32.67,  and will leave the island    with $1 million in cash.
13,00:00:39.73,00:00:39.73,  Last week on Survivor...
14,00:00:42.30,00:00:42.30,  Kelly began to have doubtsabout her role in the alliance.
15,00:00:45.67,00:00:45.67, KELLY:  If we stick with it
16,00:00:47.43,00:00:47.43,  it's just like lining lambs    to the slaughter.
17,00:00:49.50,00:00:49.50,   Who goes next? Who goes... that's no fun.
18,00:00:51.97,00:00:51.97,   ANNOUNCER:  And tension mounted   when Rudy burned the food.
19,00:00:54.87,00:00:54.87," Pathetic, burnt"
20,00:00:56.13,00:00:56.13,"   overdone, wasteful, again."
21,00:00:57.90,00:00:57.90,   ANNOUNCER:  Colleen won the reward challenge...
22,00:00:59.77,00:00:59.77,  and invited Jenna   to a barbecue meal
23,00:01:02.87,00:01:02.87,  where a plan was hatched  to vote Rich off the island.
24,00:01:05.60,00:01:05.60,"  You, me and Gervasecould definitely"
25,00:01:07.03,00:01:07.03,do something.
26,00:01:08.10,00:01:08.10,So let's do it.
27,00:01:10.03,00:01:10.03,   ANNOUNCER: But it wasn't a picnic back at Rattana
28,00:01:12.30,00:01:12.30, where Rich let it all hang out    on his birthday.
29,00:01:14.57,00:01:14.57," RUDY:When I go home, my wife asks me about, well, who was with you"
30,00:01:18.37,00:01:18.37,I'll say a queer that ran around  bare-assed half of the time.
31,00:01:21.60,00:01:21.60,"   ANNOUNCER: At tribal council, the three    former members of Pagong"
32,00:01:24.80,00:01:24.80,  tried to vote Rich off the island.
33,00:01:26.97,00:01:26.97," Happy birthday, Rich."
34,00:01:28.37,00:01:28.37, And Kelly broke   the voting alliance
35,00:01:30.10,00:01:30.10,leaving them only three strong.
36,00:01:32.97,00:01:32.97,  But it was Sean who became    the unknowing swing vote
37,00:01:35.60,00:01:35.60," his alphabetical voting    strategy,"
38,00:01:37.53,00:01:37.53, casting the death vote   for Jenna.
39,00:01:39.80,00:01:39.80,  Last vote...
40,00:01:41.53,00:01:41.53,"""J"" for ""Jenna."""
41,00:01:44.83,00:01:44.83,   ANNOUNCER: Seven people left...
42,00:01:45.87,00:01:45.87, who will be voted off tonight?
43,00:01:48.13,00:01:48.13,  Captioning sponsored by CBSand SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
44,00:03:07.77,00:03:07.77, KELLY:  It's weird the day  after anybody leaves
45,00:03:10.93,00:03:10.93," there's just,   there's just this void of,"
46,00:03:14.00,00:03:14.00," ""Oh, wait,"" you know, ""someone's..."
47,00:03:16.33,00:03:16.33,"  someone's not here."""
48,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10, RUDY:  Gervase was going to get voted off the last time
49,00:03:21.03,00:03:21.03, but at the last minute    they changed it to Jenna.
50,00:03:24.27,00:03:24.27,And I think that   that was the women's idea.
51,00:03:27.27,00:03:27.27," SUSAN:  The sun is out, it's going  to be a nice hot day."
52,00:03:30.53,00:03:30.53,  And it's quieter.
53,00:03:31.87,00:03:31.87," Sorry, Jenna,   but, man, you talk a lot."
54,00:03:37.70,00:03:37.70,  Do you guys  agree with me?
55,00:03:39.83,00:03:39.83,  I mean she is very  hard to live with.
56,00:03:41.67,00:03:41.67, You guys lived with her longer than me
57,00:03:43.77,00:03:43.77,  and I don't know howshe stayed on your teamtill you got over here.
58,00:03:46.43,00:03:46.43, I thought she would have went   a lot sooner than she did.
59,00:03:48.83,00:03:48.83,  Everybody did.
60,00:03:50.47,00:03:50.47,"   We've been here for   what, 28, 29 days now"
61,00:03:51.97,00:03:51.97,and I don't think people realize
62,00:03:54.00,00:03:54.00,   that it's 28 days   with people 24/7.
63,00:03:57.23,00:03:57.23, You know what I mean?
64,00:03:58.37,00:03:58.37,   There's no break.
65,00:03:59.37,00:03:59.37,It really isup in the air
66,00:04:00.90,00:04:00.90,you never know who's going next.And that why I love it.
67,00:04:03.10,00:04:03.10,You can thinkyou're going
68,00:04:04.57,00:04:04.57,but thenthe surprise comes
69,00:04:06.10,00:04:06.10, 'cause I thought I was going.
70,00:04:09.10,00:04:09.10,GERVASE: It's like 11 days left.
71,00:04:10.90,00:04:10.90,  I'm totally shocked that    I'm still here right now.
72,00:04:13.33,00:04:13.33,   If you look at it   since the merger
73,00:04:14.60,00:04:14.60,  it's only been Pagong peoplebeing voted off.
74,00:04:16.43,00:04:16.43,"  You know, so it's like...   something's fishy going on."
75,00:04:20.23,00:04:20.23,"You know, they can deny   an alliance all they want"
76,00:04:22.67,00:04:22.67, but there's got to be  an alliance.
77,00:04:26.40,00:04:26.40," SEAN: No, I'm not 100% sure."
78,00:04:27.97,00:04:27.97,"  If there is an alliance,  they are just voting in block"
79,00:04:30.40,00:04:30.40,but I don't knowif there is one.
80,00:04:31.83,00:04:31.83,I haven't been asked to partakein one or anything yet.
81,00:04:34.17,00:04:34.17, Dirk got four votes.
82,00:04:35.87,00:04:35.87,  Gretchen got four votes.
83,00:04:37.47,00:04:37.47, Greg got four votes.
84,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13," Sean, come on, open your eyes."
85,00:04:41.97,00:04:41.97,  Sean is interesting because
86,00:04:44.77,00:04:44.77, I'm debating right now   if I want to vote him off
87,00:04:46.77,00:04:46.77,  at the next council.
88,00:04:47.93,00:04:47.93, Because he's so scared
89,00:04:49.47,00:04:49.47, of hurting somebody's feelings   by voting for them
90,00:04:51.80,00:04:51.80,  that he's voting   alphabetical order.
91,00:04:53.47,00:04:53.47," I mean, he led the way"
92,00:04:54.70,00:04:54.70,for Jenna to be kicked off yesterday.
93,00:04:56.27,00:04:56.27,"""J"" for ""Jenna."""
94,00:04:58.43,00:04:58.43,RICHARD: And last night at the council
95,00:05:00.47,00:05:00.47,  Sean realized that his vote   impacted who gets voted off
96,00:05:05.47,00:05:05.47, because we only needed  to use three
97,00:05:08.13,00:05:08.13,   of our four allied people's votes
98,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03, to get Jenna ejected.
99,00:05:12.63,00:05:12.63,   Whatever vote I was going to go they were going to copy.
100,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83, If I knew that
101,00:05:16.27,00:05:16.27, I would certainly haveabandoned this strategy earlier.
102,00:05:18.70,00:05:18.70, Everybody yelled at me   for doing this alphabet...
103,00:05:20.97,00:05:20.97,"  I thought I was being fair,  but actually"
104,00:05:22.80,00:05:22.80, I think I was targeting people
105,00:05:24.40,00:05:24.40,and also if they weren't being targeted
106,00:05:26.70,00:05:26.70,  I was going to be targeted.
107,00:05:28.30,00:05:28.30," Because who the hell wants me   voting for them, you know?"
108,00:05:30.57,00:05:30.57,Either I was goingto be out
109,00:05:32.20,00:05:32.20,"  or, or I would keep getting other people's feelings hurt."
110,00:05:34.77,00:05:34.77,COLLEEN:It's like Sean walked into this
111,00:05:36.60,00:05:36.60,and somebody forgot to tell him it was a game.
112,00:05:38.83,00:05:38.83, And he's very concerned about people's emotions
113,00:05:41.07,00:05:41.07," and feelings,   which is wonderful"
114,00:05:42.57,00:05:42.57,"  you know, if you're  taking care of a pet."
115,00:05:45.67,00:05:45.67,"You know, not if you're playing a game called Survivor"
116,00:05:48.00,00:05:48.00,and the point of the game is tostrategize and eliminate people.
117,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,  It just felt a little scummy   to me at the time
118,00:05:54.47,00:05:54.47,  but after last night where  the remaining tribe members
119,00:05:57.43,00:05:57.43," of both parties said we really don't care,"
120,00:05:59.30,00:05:59.30,"  it's just a game,"
121,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,every single one of them
122,00:06:02.37,00:06:02.37,  has tried to form a strategy  with me personally.
123,00:06:08.83,00:06:08.83,RICHARD: Now people are talking about planning
124,00:06:10.77,00:06:10.77,  and plotting and strategy.
125,00:06:12.10,00:06:12.10,And it's just so funny.
126,00:06:14.60,00:06:14.60,"  So utterly, utterly, utterly naive"
127,00:06:16.90,00:06:16.90,  that there would be any roomleft to plot or strategize now.
128,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17," Rich is very arrogant,   very cocky"
129,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50," and very, very overconfident."
130,00:06:28.10,00:06:28.10," And I thought, you know what"
131,00:06:29.53,00:06:29.53, let's take Rich down a couple pegs.
132,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43,RICHARD: I got bombarded
133,00:06:32.90,00:06:32.90,"at the council,at the immunity council."
134,00:06:34.97,00:06:34.97,Little alliance
135,00:06:36.03,00:06:36.03,tried to attack Richieon my birthday.
136,00:06:40.33,00:06:40.33,But I lived.
137,00:06:40.33,00:06:40.33,Now he's going tonot fish no more.
138,00:06:42.50,00:06:42.50,How freaking funnywould it have been if he got
139,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,"sent home on his birthday,though?"
140,00:06:45.87,00:06:45.87,I wasn't evenexpecting that.
141,00:06:47.37,00:06:47.37,  Rich was this close to leaving last week.
142,00:06:49.80,00:06:49.80,That was a good feeling.
143,00:06:51.20,00:06:51.20,"  For me, it was justa great feeling."
144,00:06:52.80,00:06:52.80,  And you could see   it's affected Rich.
145,00:06:54.80,00:06:54.80,"  After those three votes,   Rich was..."
146,00:06:57.17,00:06:57.17, he couldn't believe it.
147,00:06:58.80,00:06:58.80,"   Rich even thinks I, uh..."
148,00:07:01.23,00:07:01.23,   formed an allianceagainst him last night.
149,00:07:03.80,00:07:03.80,Which I didn't.
150,00:07:04.83,00:07:04.83,"That's okay,no hard feelings."
151,00:07:07.37,00:07:07.37,I'll just catchless fish.
152,00:07:10.40,00:07:10.40,"We like the fish, Rich."
153,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,"Yeah, I thought youliked the fish, Gerv."
154,00:07:14.37,00:07:14.37,"Not as much as I thoughtyou did, though."
155,00:07:22.40,00:07:22.40,RICHARD:  When I fish is somewhat strategic.
156,00:07:25.67,00:07:25.67,  So I'm thinking to myself
157,00:07:27.07,00:07:27.07,  it would be a heck of a lot more valuable
158,00:07:29.57,00:07:29.57," I guess to me, if I got fish"
159,00:07:32.40,00:07:32.40,  after a couple more folks   were gone.
160,00:07:34.37,00:07:34.37,And I'll limit the fishthat I'm getting
161,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,so that I'm not out here   working my ass off
162,00:07:38.80,00:07:38.80,  and people just expect that  there will be lots of fish.
163,00:07:42.27,00:07:42.27,When we get downto the last fouror five of us
164,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20,I'll feed uslike kings.
165,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20,I can't wait.
166,00:07:45.93,00:07:45.93,   I can't wait.
167,00:07:47.30,00:07:47.30,  It ain't happeningfast enough.
168,00:07:47.30,00:07:47.30,I know.
169,00:07:48.47,00:07:48.47, Enjoy your day.
170,00:07:49.47,00:07:49.47,"Okay, thanks,you be careful."
171,00:07:50.70,00:07:50.70,I'll see you later.
172,00:07:51.77,00:07:51.77,"  All right, bye-bye."
173,00:07:55.20,00:07:55.20, SUSAN:  I don't blame him one bit for not worrying about fishing
174,00:07:58.07,00:07:58.07,   till there's five people.
175,00:07:59.53,00:07:59.53, That's a lot of mouths to feed and they don't appreciate it.
176,00:08:10.70,00:08:10.70,RICHARD:  There are analogies between    my going out to the reef
177,00:08:13.77,00:08:13.77, and hunting the fish
178,00:08:15.37,00:08:15.37, and my picking off the tribe   members one by one.
179,00:08:19.23,00:08:19.23, I've been stalking them since  before we got on the island.
180,00:08:28.10,00:08:28.10," Bye-bye, baby.    (Gulps )"
181,00:08:32.23,00:08:32.23," it's a slow, more methodical game here on the island"
182,00:08:35.57,00:08:35.57, with each of the tribe members    than it is with the fish
183,00:08:38.40,00:08:38.40,  but there are similarities.
184,00:08:40.60,00:08:40.60, That's probably the last fish I'll get until there are five.
185,00:08:43.73,00:08:43.73, There are seven participants    right now
186,00:08:45.67,00:08:45.67,  and I probably won't bother  to get any more fish
187,00:08:47.67,00:08:47.67,  until there are five people.
188,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83, SUSAN:  Colleen and Gervase   are just sitting over there
189,00:09:01.20,00:09:01.20," and I'm like,   ""You backstabbers."""
190,00:09:04.63,00:09:04.63,"First you want him out of here,"
191,00:09:06.13,00:09:06.13,and then you're   all over the food.
192,00:09:09.43,00:09:09.43,   I'm getting   filled up tonight   on one bowl.
193,00:09:10.80,00:09:10.80, That's sad.
194,00:09:12.40,00:09:12.40,   ( burps )
195,00:09:13.97,00:09:13.97," Ooh, good rice, Rudy."
196,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,"Go, Suzy, go."
197,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,You're the best.
198,00:09:17.10,00:09:17.10,I got some nice belches   out here.
199,00:09:18.60,00:09:18.60, My strategy all along
200,00:09:20.20,00:09:20.20, has been to just play the role   as a dumb redneck.
201,00:09:23.33,00:09:23.33,( belches )
202,00:09:24.77,00:09:24.77,"   there you go,   Suzy Q."
203,00:09:26.60,00:09:26.60, SUSAN:  People like think rednecks   are so vulnerable and dumb
204,00:09:29.57,00:09:29.57, they'll talk to them openly.
205,00:09:32.07,00:09:32.07, Like Rich did.
206,00:09:34.10,00:09:34.10,   ( laughs )
207,00:09:35.47,00:09:35.47,"you know, how he's going   to burn everybody."
208,00:09:37.00,00:09:37.00,"Okay, so here'sthe deal."
209,00:09:39.70,00:09:39.70,"I want you to pick herto be ejected, not me."
210,00:09:42.27,00:09:42.27,So you can plan that.
211,00:09:43.93,00:09:43.93, SUSAN: Hopefully in the end
212,00:09:45.87,00:09:45.87," the, the old redneck will burn   the city slickers."
213,00:09:49.20,00:09:49.20,   So we'll see what happens.
214,00:09:50.77,00:09:50.77,"You know, I think itwould be best"
215,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,"is if we can,me and you"
216,00:09:55.07,00:09:55.07, can take care of... take him out at the end.
217,00:09:57.10,00:09:57.10,Take Rich out?
218,00:09:57.10,00:09:57.10,Yeah.
219,00:09:58.63,00:09:58.63,Just me and you.
220,00:10:00.33,00:10:00.33,  I've been knowing all along   that I'm going to burn him
221,00:10:02.77,00:10:02.77,but I didn't want to say  anything to Kelly too early.
222,00:10:05.30,00:10:05.30,   Why do you think he got   so many votes against him
223,00:10:07.10,00:10:07.10,at the last council?
224,00:10:08.27,00:10:08.27,"He's a snake. I gotto thank him, though"
225,00:10:10.73,00:10:10.73,for getting our craptogether early.
226,00:10:12.53,00:10:12.53,"If it wasn't for him,we might not have"
227,00:10:14.20,00:10:14.20,gotten together this early.
228,00:10:15.70,00:10:15.70, I never trusted Rich.
229,00:10:16.73,00:10:16.73, Of course I don't trust him.
230,00:10:18.17,00:10:18.17,  But am I doing a good job
231,00:10:19.60,00:10:19.60, making him think I trust him?
232,00:10:21.27,00:10:21.27, I hope it looks  like I trust him now.
233,00:10:23.97,00:10:23.97,I knew he was working onyou to get me out anyway.
234,00:10:26.37,00:10:26.37,"   Oh, yeah."
235,00:10:27.80,00:10:27.80,   He's not that   ... smart.
236,00:10:29.70,00:10:29.70,Right now I don't trust anybody    except for Kelly.
237,00:10:32.00,00:10:32.00,  I trust Kelly 100%.
238,00:10:34.23,00:10:34.23,"100%, And she trusts me   the same."
239,00:10:36.43,00:10:36.43,  We're like sisters.
240,00:10:37.73,00:10:37.73,I want me and youto take him out.
241,00:10:39.43,00:10:39.43, I think so.
242,00:10:40.50,00:10:40.50,Just the threeof us.
243,00:10:41.67,00:10:41.67,   But you got   to let him...
244,00:10:42.67,00:10:42.67,I really would.
245,00:10:43.67,00:10:43.67,I would feel good.
246,00:10:45.07,00:10:45.07,I would feel so goodabout myself.
247,00:10:46.77,00:10:46.77, KELLY:  I really like Sue a lot.
248,00:10:48.43,00:10:48.43,We've bonded quite a bit   in these 30 days.
249,00:10:51.67,00:10:51.67, And it'll be 20 yearscome this Easter
250,00:10:53.57,00:10:53.57,  that I lost my best friend.
251,00:10:55.27,00:10:55.27,"  So, coming across Kelly,   somebody I can hang with..."
252,00:10:59.37,00:10:59.37,that's a long...   I ain't going to ... her.
253,00:11:03.90,00:11:03.90,  I'm not burning her.
254,00:11:09.97,00:11:09.97, KELLY: The only person I trust
255,00:11:11.53,00:11:11.53," is Sue, and sometimes  I doubt that."
256,00:11:15.30,00:11:15.30,   It's getting to that point
257,00:11:16.73,00:11:16.73,  where you don't know   who you can trust.
258,00:11:19.73,00:11:19.73,RICHARD: But I got to remember
259,00:11:21.17,00:11:21.17, it's a game. And I believe them.
260,00:11:23.20,00:11:23.20,"  I believe you,  I believe her."
261,00:11:24.83,00:11:24.83,And I believe Kelly.
262,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,   But I don't know if Kelly  is as solid as that
263,00:11:29.33,00:11:29.33,"  all the way through,   I hope so."
264,00:11:30.47,00:11:30.47,   I'm betting on it.
265,00:11:31.70,00:11:31.70,I was betting on it by bringing her into this.
266,00:11:33.83,00:11:33.83,And I'm feelingvery good about Sue.
267,00:11:36.00,00:11:36.00,  If they're not
268,00:11:37.60,00:11:37.60, then they're brilliantbecause they've played me well.
269,00:11:40.00,00:11:40.00, They've played me beautifully.
270,00:11:41.83,00:11:41.83, SUSAN: I'd rather just me and Kelly    burn him.
271,00:11:44.70,00:11:44.70, Just because   it'll feel so good.
272,00:11:48.50,00:11:48.50,RICHARD: If the alliance   were to break down
273,00:11:51.97,00:11:51.97,  and something else happened that I wasn't aware of
274,00:11:54.50,00:11:54.50, I would shake those people's  hands and say congratulations
275,00:11:57.40,00:11:57.40,"  you, you know, brilliant"
276,00:11:58.93,00:11:58.93,"  good job, you got it"
277,00:12:00.53,00:12:00.53,   because you've fooled me.
278,00:12:02.60,00:12:02.60,  Me and Kelly  are taking him down.
279,00:12:20.67,00:12:20.67,  Watch out for that.
280,00:12:23.03,00:12:23.03, Hark!
281,00:12:23.03,00:12:23.03, Uh-oh.
282,00:12:24.33,00:12:24.33,A cigar!   A message!
283,00:12:26.13,00:12:26.13,RICHARD:Uh-oh.
284,00:12:27.17,00:12:27.17,"Oh, shut up."
285,00:12:28.73,00:12:28.73, Only one cigar?
286,00:12:29.73,00:12:29.73,Are we goingto have to roll 'em?
287,00:12:31.97,00:12:31.97,"   No, there's more."
288,00:12:32.97,00:12:32.97,Yee-hah!
289,00:12:32.97,00:12:32.97,Whoo!
290,00:12:36.57,00:12:36.57,"   Roll that bad boy,   light that bad boy"

294,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,   Okay.
295,00:12:43.33,00:12:43.33,"""This is an announcement for Gervase..."
296,00:12:45.60,00:12:45.60,  ( gasping ):Gervase!

300,00:12:51.97,00:12:51.97, About your son.

302,00:12:58.10,00:12:58.10,"Hey, everybody,it's a boy!"
303,00:12:59.73,00:12:59.73,   Smoke up!
304,00:13:01.27,00:13:01.27,   Smoke up.
305,00:13:03.43,00:13:03.43,RICHARD:I didn't even know Gerv washaving another baby.
306,00:13:06.63,00:13:06.63,GERVASE:  It's real simple.
307,00:13:08.00,00:13:08.00,I have two kids from a previous relationship:
308,00:13:11.20,00:13:11.20,"   Dawnelle's ten,   Genelle is seven."
309,00:13:13.37,00:13:13.37,I'm with Carmela now
310,00:13:14.87,00:13:14.87, Kayla with her and now Gunner.
311,00:13:16.57,00:13:16.57," You know, Kayla's two and Gunner's the new addition."
312,00:13:19.40,00:13:19.40,Four kids-- holy Moses.
313,00:13:22.90,00:13:22.90,"Now are youand, uh, Gunner"
314,00:13:25.87,00:13:25.87,and Kayla's mom together  permanently?
315,00:13:28.77,00:13:28.77,"   GERVASE:   Nah, never   been married."
316,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,"Yeah, we havesome rough spots"
317,00:13:33.00,00:13:33.00,  we need to fix that
318,00:13:34.33,00:13:34.33,"so we're just smoothing  those out, you know."
319,00:13:37.57,00:13:37.57," RUDY: When I was brought up, if a girl was pregnant"
320,00:13:40.97,00:13:40.97,"  and wasn't married,"
321,00:13:42.30,00:13:42.30,  you'd never even know it.
322,00:13:44.37,00:13:44.37,"  I mean, they'd take her out  of town or somewhere."
323,00:13:46.57,00:13:46.57,"  It was that bad, you know."
324,00:13:47.97,00:13:47.97, The girl could have had an abortion.
325,00:13:51.77,00:13:51.77, I-I'll agree with an abortion.
326,00:13:57.50,00:13:57.50,  But not having kidsout of wedlock.
327,00:13:59.80,00:13:59.80,  It's a huge responsibility.
328,00:14:01.57,00:14:01.57, Huge.
329,00:14:03.03,00:14:03.03,"It's hard enoughfor one family,much less two."
330,00:14:05.40,00:14:05.40,"   Yeah, one child's   a huge responsibility"
331,00:14:06.77,00:14:06.77, let alone two.
332,00:14:08.03,00:14:08.03,Four kids between two families.
333,00:14:21.70,00:14:21.70,"No way, man."
334,00:14:22.77,00:14:22.77," Oh, no way."
335,00:14:25.10,00:14:25.10,Is it empty?
336,00:14:26.63,00:14:26.63, It's empty.
337,00:14:28.13,00:14:28.13,"   Oh, what a..."
338,00:14:31.60,00:14:31.60,Aah...

340,00:14:34.10,00:14:34.10,"  Oh, my god."
341,00:14:35.27,00:14:35.27,WOMEN:Pizza!
342,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,You were talkingabout pizza.
343,00:14:39.60,00:14:39.60," ""An oven fresh pizza,doesn't that sound nice?"
344,00:14:43.20,00:14:43.20,"  ""A phone call's been placed,   steady feet win a slice."""

346,00:14:48.47,00:14:48.47,It's going to be some balance.
347,00:14:50.07,00:14:50.07," ""Steady feet,"" could it be hot coals?"
348,00:14:53.03,00:14:53.03,No.

351,00:14:58.50,00:14:58.50,That's what that means.

358,00:15:21.03,00:15:21.03,to make it from one end  of the course to the other.
359,00:15:23.77,00:15:23.77,   For the winner--   a phone call home

361,00:15:28.70,00:15:28.70,"  plus a slice of hot pizza,    delivered by helicopter."
362,00:15:34.37,00:15:34.37,"   Hi, Jeff."
363,00:15:35.37,00:15:35.37,"   What's up, G?"

405,00:17:28.03,00:17:28.03,"baby, you're gettingsome pizza anda phone call home."
406,00:17:32.60,00:17:32.60,"   Good effort, man."
407,00:17:33.67,00:17:33.67,Good effort.
408,00:17:35.57,00:17:35.57,"  All right, Gervase,  here comes your pizza."
409,00:17:45.33,00:17:45.33,Is that it?
410,00:17:46.53,00:17:46.53,   That's it.
411,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,  Hang tight.
412,00:18:04.50,00:18:04.50,Oh...
413,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,Hot slice of cheese.
414,00:18:09.27,00:18:09.27,"   The middle of the   South China Sea,"
415,00:18:10.83,00:18:10.83,pizza deliveredby a helicopter.
416,00:18:12.73,00:18:12.73,It is your sliceto enjoy here.

419,00:18:18.67,00:18:18.67," Do not share, Gerv."
420,00:18:20.37,00:18:20.37,"Gerv, eat it."
421,00:18:23.07,00:18:23.07,Nobody wants it?Nobody wants it?
422,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,I want a bite.
423,00:18:29.57,00:18:29.57,I don't wantany really.
424,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,Take a big bite.
425,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,"   Oh, yeah."
426,00:18:35.70,00:18:35.70,I know you'rea big pizza fan.
427,00:18:37.27,00:18:37.27,"Thank you, Gerv."
428,00:18:38.27,00:18:38.27,This is plenty for me.
429,00:18:39.77,00:18:39.77,   Now finish it up.
430,00:18:40.87,00:18:40.87,GERVASE:That's a big slice.
431,00:18:42.93,00:18:42.93,"All right, Gerv."
432,00:18:47.23,00:18:47.23," JEFF: Okay, Gervase, now for the second part of the reward."
433,00:18:50.80,00:18:50.80,   We have a cell phone here.
434,00:18:52.07,00:18:52.07,"If I said you could makeone phone call,"
435,00:18:54.20,00:18:54.20,who would you call?
436,00:18:55.77,00:18:55.77,Don't even say it.
437,00:18:57.80,00:18:57.80,"  Gervase, don't  even think it."
438,00:19:00.67,00:19:00.67,"   I'm going to call   Carmela, see how   the baby is."
439,00:19:02.73,00:19:02.73,  ALL:  Yay!
440,00:19:04.23,00:19:04.23,"   All right, it's 3:00 A.M.  In Jersey right now."
441,00:19:05.93,00:19:05.93,"We're not going   to call right now,"
442,00:19:07.20,00:19:07.20,"  waste it when she's asleep,may not answer."
443,00:19:08.77,00:19:08.77,"Tomorrow morning,I'll come backover to Rattana,"
444,00:19:11.20,00:19:11.20," I'll bring the phone,"
445,00:19:12.53,00:19:12.53,"we'll call home, talk to mom,see how things are going."
446,00:19:14.90,00:19:14.90,"  Sounds good, Jeff.  You the man."
447,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,Way to go.
448,00:19:17.20,00:19:17.20,"All right,enjoy your pizza."
449,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,Let's walk alongthis way.
450,00:20:04.93,00:20:04.93, RUDY: Ten more days--   it'll all be over.
451,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,I'll probably never seethese people again.
452,00:20:11.10,00:20:11.10,   The way I want it.
453,00:20:17.00,00:20:17.00,  Going to make my phone call to my family.
454,00:20:21.07,00:20:21.07,"   See how everybody's doing, make sure they're doing good."
455,00:20:25.57,00:20:25.57,  I certainly don't judge him
456,00:20:27.50,00:20:27.50, for being not marriedand having kids.
457,00:20:29.60,00:20:29.60,"I mean, he had one relationship,"
458,00:20:31.73,00:20:31.73,"and then he had another relationship,"
459,00:20:33.40,00:20:33.40,   and he seems to be in a relationship now
460,00:20:35.20,00:20:35.20,"  with a woman where he's had two children,"
461,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83, and is working toward
462,00:20:38.63,00:20:38.63," a committed, long-term  relationship"
463,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,  to parent those children    together.
464,00:20:44.43,00:20:44.43,   I don't agree with babies out of wedlock
465,00:20:47.07,00:20:47.07,"that kind of garbage, you know?"
466,00:20:50.20,00:20:50.20,"  Half of the problem they got in this country today,"
467,00:20:52.73,00:20:52.73,there's no family life.
468,00:20:54.57,00:20:54.57,And then they're blaming  the schools.
469,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,  It starts way beforethem kids go to school.
470,00:21:01.50,00:21:01.50,  They need a family.
471,00:21:03.23,00:21:03.23,They need somebody beating them  in the head.
472,00:21:11.77,00:21:11.77, ( cell phone dialing )
473,00:21:13.87,00:21:13.87,   ( phone ringing )
474,00:21:17.07,00:21:17.07,CARMELA: Hello?
475,00:21:18.07,00:21:18.07, Hello.
476,00:21:19.23,00:21:19.23,It's me.
477,00:21:20.87,00:21:20.87,   Are you all right?
478,00:21:21.87,00:21:21.87,  Huh?
479,00:21:22.93,00:21:22.93,   Are you all right?
480,00:21:24.07,00:21:24.07,   ( laughs )
481,00:21:27.07,00:21:27.07,  How are you?
482,00:21:28.30,00:21:28.30,   I'm fine.
483,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,How's the baby?
484,00:21:30.80,00:21:30.80,I'm sitting here with himin my arms
485,00:21:33.10,00:21:33.10,and Kayla's just kissing him.
486,00:21:35.00,00:21:35.00,"Like, all she doesis play with his hair."
487,00:21:37.73,00:21:37.73,  Does he have a lot of hair?
488,00:21:40.37,00:21:40.37," Oh, yeah? Like Kayla?"
489,00:21:42.27,00:21:42.27,   Or more than her?
490,00:21:43.50,00:21:43.50,You want to talkto daddy?
491,00:21:44.77,00:21:44.77,"Say, ""Hi, daddy."""
492,00:21:45.83,00:21:45.83,Daddy.
493,00:21:46.90,00:21:46.90,"  Hey, Kayla!"
494,00:21:48.73,00:21:48.73,  What are you doing?
495,00:21:50.63,00:21:50.63, Daddy.
496,00:21:51.83,00:21:51.83,"Yeah, give him a kiss,say, ""Bye-bye."""
497,00:21:53.53,00:21:53.53,"Tell him, say, ""Bye-bye."""
498,00:21:56.40,00:21:56.40,   ( laughs )
499,00:21:57.70,00:21:57.70," What, she's in shock? It's been that long?"
500,00:22:03.67,00:22:03.67,"COLLEEN:  I mean it's better that he's not married,"
501,00:22:06.40,00:22:06.40,'cause he hasissues right nowwith Carmela
502,00:22:08.53,00:22:08.53,and it's betterthat they're not married
503,00:22:10.50,00:22:10.50, than just get marriedand then have problems later on.
504,00:22:13.20,00:22:13.20," From talking to him the other day, I kind of got the scoop,"
505,00:22:17.17,00:22:17.17,"and I'm sure you probably heard a little more,"
506,00:22:19.40,00:22:19.40,"but the first girl he was with,"
507,00:22:21.20,00:22:21.20,he really triedto stay with her and everything
508,00:22:23.93,00:22:23.93,"especially for the kids,"
509,00:22:25.47,00:22:25.47,"  and she was kind of the one  who was just, like,"
510,00:22:27.43,00:22:27.43,"""Look, it's not going to work."""
511,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,"So, I think he-he's very   responsible with his kids."
512,00:22:32.03,00:22:32.03,   He's paying for the kids.
513,00:22:33.50,00:22:33.50,   He's spending time with the kids.
514,00:22:34.90,00:22:34.90,   He's being a dad.
515,00:22:38.20,00:22:38.20,"   It wouldn't be my choice,but that's his,"
516,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,  and he's free to make that.
517,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,  I really am so proud of you.
518,00:22:49.20,00:22:49.20,I can't believe there's  11 days left
519,00:22:50.87,00:22:50.87,and you are still in it.
520,00:22:52.20,00:22:52.20,"I'm just trying to, uh, finish it out."
521,00:22:55.80,00:22:55.80,I've taken care   of all your bills
522,00:22:57.40,00:22:57.40,   and all that other stuff.
523,00:22:58.83,00:22:58.83,"Well, let everybody know  I miss them."
524,00:23:00.47,00:23:00.47, Tell your mom I even miss her.
525,00:23:01.97,00:23:01.97," Yeah, unbelievable, isn't it?"
526,00:23:04.80,00:23:04.80,  I love you and Kay loves you and Gunner loves you.
527,00:23:07.57,00:23:07.57,"And, uh, so... you know."
528,00:23:10.37,00:23:10.37,  I love you.Tell Gunner I love him.
529,00:23:12.17,00:23:12.17,  Tell Kay I love her.
530,00:23:13.47,00:23:13.47,   All right.
531,00:23:25.47,00:23:25.47,"Come on, let's seehow his phone call went."
532,00:23:28.13,00:23:28.13,"  Oh, he's here?"
533,00:23:29.50,00:23:29.50,"   Oh, he's right there."
534,00:23:31.10,00:23:31.10,Tell us aboutthe whole situation.
535,00:23:32.83,00:23:32.83,Talk to Carmela?
536,00:23:33.90,00:23:33.90," Yeah, she's doing good."
537,00:23:35.87,00:23:35.87,"   He's doing good,   everybody's   just doing great."
538,00:23:46.67,00:23:46.67,"We seriously,"
539,00:23:48.87,00:23:48.87, seriously lucked out.
540,00:23:50.13,00:23:50.13, I have no idea what I would have done
541,00:23:51.77,00:23:51.77,had I ended up on Pagong   in the beginning.
542,00:23:53.37,00:23:53.37,"Oh, me, too."
543,00:23:54.37,00:23:54.37,Committed suicide.
544,00:23:55.40,00:23:55.40, I'd have killed somebody.
545,00:23:56.77,00:23:56.77,I could never have built   alliances
546,00:23:58.83,00:23:58.83,"such solid ones,   particularly, too."
547,00:24:01.10,00:24:01.10,   They're too flaky.
548,00:24:02.57,00:24:02.57,Changes withthe wind.
549,00:24:05.00,00:24:05.00,"  Too immature, yeah, is what it is."
550,00:24:07.50,00:24:07.50,"  Like, Kelly's even  a little flaky,  at moments."
551,00:24:11.33,00:24:11.33,"   She's doing well, though."
552,00:24:12.93,00:24:12.93,   Yeah.
553,00:24:13.93,00:24:13.93," I mean, for 22, she's amazing."
554,00:24:15.87,00:24:15.87," Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
555,00:24:17.20,00:24:17.20,  I hope she's solid.
556,00:24:23.03,00:24:23.03, KELLY:  This is not what I thought    it was going to be like.
557,00:24:25.83,00:24:25.83,  It's not about surviving  the elements.
558,00:24:27.50,00:24:27.50, It's about surviving yourself.
559,00:24:29.80,00:24:29.80,  I didn't want to be a part of the alliance
560,00:24:32.60,00:24:32.60,because I thought it was  conniving and dirty and untrue to myself.
561,00:24:37.27,00:24:37.27,GERVASE:  I don't think Kelly really   wanted to make an alliance
562,00:24:40.70,00:24:40.70,  with anybody here in Tagi.
563,00:24:42.60,00:24:42.60,  I think they kind of   strong-armed Kelly
564,00:24:44.63,00:24:44.63,"into making an allianceand joining their team,"
565,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,"  and it's really affected her   personally, like,"
566,00:24:49.90,00:24:49.90, as a tug-of-war on the inside.
567,00:24:53.67,00:24:53.67," KELLY: It's not worth it to feel like ... for the rest of your life,"
568,00:24:58.63,00:24:58.63," um, for a little bit of money,  and your 15 minutes."
569,00:25:04.43,00:25:04.43," You know, I kind of feel like  Luke Skywalker, or something."
570,00:25:08.53,00:25:08.53,I crossed over to the dark side  for a moment.
571,00:25:11.60,00:25:11.60, I don't like playing the game    that way.
572,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,Does that feel likeit fits your face okay?
573,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,Mm-hmm.
574,00:25:16.63,00:25:16.63, KELLY: Making a deal with Rich
575,00:25:18.10,00:25:18.10, is kind of like making a deal with the devil.
576,00:25:20.80,00:25:20.80,"  Then you know how to use it   to breath, or no?"
577,00:25:22.97,00:25:22.97, KELLY: I decided a while ago
578,00:25:24.60,00:25:24.60, not to be part  of the big alliance.
579,00:25:29.17,00:25:29.17,It's automatic.
580,00:25:30.17,00:25:30.17,I don't know if I could do that.
581,00:25:32.17,00:25:32.17,You'd be surprised.
582,00:25:33.30,00:25:33.30,"Like right now,you are."
583,00:25:35.00,00:25:35.00, KELLY: I've been pretty much   letting Rich think
584,00:25:39.33,00:25:39.33,"   that I'm still part of hislittle mind-game, follower thing"
585,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,"  the whole time, basically,    because I figured"
586,00:25:46.57,00:25:46.57,  if I did tell him    that I grew a conscience
587,00:25:49.67,00:25:49.67, and I didn't want to be   his little follower anymore
588,00:25:52.57,00:25:52.57,"  that he would turn around    and shut me down,"
589,00:25:55.57,00:25:55.57,"which I'm certain he would have,"
590,00:25:57.30,00:25:57.30,"so, I'm glad I didn't tell him."
591,00:26:01.03,00:26:01.03,RICHARD:You're seeming more downand more serious to me
592,00:26:04.40,00:26:04.40,toward the end.
593,00:26:05.40,00:26:05.40,Really?
594,00:26:06.40,00:26:06.40,Mm-hmm.
595,00:26:07.40,00:26:07.40,A lot more so than...early on.
596,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23, KELLY:  Do I just kind of roll over   and let Rich decide
597,00:26:13.23,00:26:13.23, how it's all going to play out
598,00:26:15.20,00:26:15.20,or do I try and beat him at his own damn game?
599,00:26:19.83,00:26:19.83, Done.
600,00:26:25.63,00:26:25.63,  Hey!
601,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"Wait, start at the beginning."
602,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,Did it start?
603,00:26:34.97,00:26:34.97,   Yeah.

646,00:28:42.67,00:28:42.67,and stack it.
647,00:28:44.13,00:28:44.13,You each have your own fire pit  and a weighted flag.

671,00:30:52.13,00:30:52.13,Okay. I got you.

673,00:30:56.20,00:30:56.20,   It's going to take  a long time
674,00:30:57.20,00:30:57.20,for these fires to burn.
675,00:31:36.50,00:31:36.50, Yeah!
676,00:31:38.60,00:31:38.60,"  Oh, good job, Rich."
677,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17, I could cook some rice
678,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,"over here, though,if you want me to."
679,00:31:44.43,00:31:44.43,Immune!
680,00:32:31.57,00:32:31.57,GERVASE: Rich got lucky  and won his challenge
681,00:32:34.40,00:32:34.40,"and now he's... oh, man!"
682,00:32:36.90,00:32:36.90,   Wait till you see him now.
683,00:32:38.43,00:32:38.43,  If you watch Rich  the rest of this day
684,00:32:40.53,00:32:40.53,  watch the arrogance
685,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00, and the swagger    he's walking around with
686,00:32:44.10,00:32:44.10,  'cause he won that immunity
687,00:32:45.50,00:32:45.50,  and he knows  he can't be touched tonight.
688,00:32:47.40,00:32:47.40,"  What, if anything,  should be said..."
689,00:32:49.80,00:32:49.80,  I think Rich is    the ringleader..
690,00:32:51.67,00:32:51.67," Or if he's not the ringleader,  then he's second in command."
691,00:32:55.87,00:32:55.87,"  If I have to say,  ""Do I know for a fact"
692,00:32:58.47,00:32:58.47,"  there's an alliance,and all this stuff is going on?"""
693,00:33:01.57,00:33:01.57,"  No, I don't know for a fact, but I'm a smart guy, you know."

695,00:33:10.37,00:33:10.37, KELLY: I-I was talking to-to Colleen

698,00:33:16.87,00:33:16.87,  It's like they know  they're leaving next
699,00:33:18.73,00:33:18.73, so they're just going to sit around and wait
700,00:33:20.97,00:33:20.97,"you know, with a red dot pointed to their head?"
701,00:33:23.23,00:33:23.23,You have to keepyour eye out.
702,00:33:27.03,00:33:27.03," Gervase, what are you making?"
703,00:33:28.87,00:33:28.87,I'm making costumes for tonight.
704,00:33:31.27,00:33:31.27,  My code name for tonight...
705,00:33:33.20,00:33:33.20,"is ""bull's-eye."""
706,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00," I'm otherwise known as ""sitting duck."""
707,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,( snickering )
708,00:33:41.67,00:33:41.67,GERVASE: I think Rich--
709,00:33:44.87,00:33:44.87, being the cocky person  that he is--
710,00:33:47.03,00:33:47.03,will think that they canget rid of me with three votes.
711,00:33:50.80,00:33:50.80,"  Now, Sean approached me,  saying he wouldn't, uh, mind"
712,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,"  making an alliance,   but he said"
713,00:33:58.20,00:33:58.20,  he would only do it   if Kelly joined us
714,00:33:59.97,00:33:59.97,  so it'd be a sure thing.
715,00:34:01.20,00:34:01.20,"...bringing, like,a bundle of sticks"
716,00:34:03.27,00:34:03.27,and every morning...
717,00:34:05.00,00:34:05.00,  so they really only had    their three core people:
718,00:34:07.00,00:34:07.00,"  Rudy, Rich and Sue"
719,00:34:08.47,00:34:08.47, who probably definitely would be with the plan.
720,00:34:10.50,00:34:10.50," That leaves four other votes, including mine"
721,00:34:14.03,00:34:14.03, that can go on somebody else.
722,00:34:16.67,00:34:16.67,  So somehow    we have to work on Kelly
723,00:34:18.50,00:34:18.50, and figure out  who she's voting for
724,00:34:20.30,00:34:20.30, and then maybe Colleen can also vote for that person.
725,00:34:23.83,00:34:23.83,"   So, the best bet is Kelly."
726,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,   SUSAN:   Where's Kelly at?
727,00:34:27.20,00:34:27.20,I don't know.
728,00:34:31.07,00:34:31.07, KELLY:  I wish something exciting would happen--
729,00:34:33.80,00:34:33.80,"  something shocking, something that nobody expects."
730,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57,"  Well, sh..."
731,00:34:48.33,00:34:48.33, Looks like we got somethunderheads building out there.
732,00:34:52.03,00:34:52.03, Should provide for an exciting night.
733,00:35:05.20,00:35:05.20,"We're preparing to, uh,batten down the hatches."
734,00:35:08.23,00:35:08.23, ( whistling )
735,00:35:09.80,00:35:09.80, SEAN: There's going to be a storm tonight.

737,00:35:25.17,00:35:25.17,Kelly cut her own throat tonight
738,00:35:27.40,00:35:27.40, and it was a wonderful thing.
739,00:35:29.47,00:35:29.47,"She, uh, tried to align herself"
740,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,  to the kids her age
741,00:35:33.20,00:35:33.20, and was probably trying to look a little nicer
742,00:35:35.40,00:35:35.40," to the other group,  but I have a feeling"
743,00:35:37.93,00:35:37.93, she's got more going on    with them
744,00:35:39.53,00:35:39.53, than she's letting on.
745,00:35:40.77,00:35:40.77,Whoo!
746,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43,"She doesn't realizewe can see it, right through it."
747,00:35:46.20,00:35:46.20, Yeah. Yeah.
748,00:35:47.30,00:35:47.30,Not smart at all.
749,00:35:48.47,00:35:48.47,Too much playing.
750,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,   Yeah. That's not serious.
751,00:35:51.63,00:35:51.63,No.
752,00:35:52.70,00:35:52.70,It's serious for me.
753,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80,"Oh, it is for me, too."
754,00:35:55.80,00:35:55.80,RICHARD: It'll be interesting.
755,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87, She could have consequences.
756,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,We haven't decided yet.
757,00:36:02.50,00:36:02.50,"  ""We."" Hmm..."
758,00:36:03.87,00:36:03.87,   ( sniffs )

761,00:36:32.67,00:36:32.67,we're going to go ahead and bring our jury in
762,00:36:34.80,00:36:34.80,as you guysare sitting down.
763,00:36:38.13,00:36:38.13,Okay.
764,00:36:39.30,00:36:39.30,Sean.
765,00:36:40.57,00:36:40.57,I got to revisit
766,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,   the alphabet voting system
767,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,   because it had   a dramatic effect
768,00:36:46.90,00:36:46.90,on the vote
769,00:36:48.13,00:36:48.13,because it resultedin Jenna being ejected.
770,00:36:51.30,00:36:51.30,  What were your  thoughts when  you left here?
771,00:36:53.10,00:36:53.10," Uh, when we went back to camp, I was pretty much devastated."
772,00:36:55.97,00:36:55.97, Everyone was around... we hung around by the campfire
773,00:36:58.53,00:36:58.53," and uh, both the remaining Pagong people"
774,00:37:01.03,00:37:01.03,and the remainingTagi people urged me
775,00:37:02.90,00:37:02.90,"implored me to, uh, vote, um,in my own best interest--"
776,00:37:06.20,00:37:06.20,to get with the program.
777,00:37:07.57,00:37:07.57, In the immortal words
778,00:37:08.67,00:37:08.67,"of Sue,""to get some balls."""
779,00:37:11.63,00:37:11.63,  And that's what I plan to do   from here on out.
780,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03," Kelly, we haven't talked much  about your strategy"
781,00:37:16.70,00:37:16.70,  in terms of voting.
782,00:37:18.07,00:37:18.07, You got to have one at this point.
783,00:37:19.43,00:37:19.43,Sure. Why not?
784,00:37:20.43,00:37:20.43,I think everybody does.
785,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83, What is it? What's it based on?
786,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,It's based on who's competition   and who's pissing me off.
787,00:37:26.10,00:37:26.10,( Colleen laughs )
788,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,"How about you, Colleen?"
789,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,"Actually, tonight I'd like to be referred to as ""sitting duck."""
790,00:37:31.73,00:37:31.73," ""Sitting duck""?"
791,00:37:31.73,00:37:31.73,"Yes, thank you."
792,00:37:33.40,00:37:33.40,  You feel as though  you might be
793,00:37:34.67,00:37:34.67,   a target tonight?
794,00:37:35.97,00:37:35.97,  Definitely.   I'm just waiting.
795,00:37:37.47,00:37:37.47,   And that's based on what?
796,00:37:38.70,00:37:38.70, That's based on eyes and ears
797,00:37:41.77,00:37:41.77,and alliances and nonalliances.
798,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,Sue.
799,00:37:46.17,00:37:46.17,"Um, we're all sitting here."
800,00:37:48.37,00:37:48.37,We're adults.
801,00:37:49.97,00:37:49.97,"  This is a game, but the gamealso reflects a lot on real life"
802,00:37:55.80,00:37:55.80,and you always bring up  this alliance thing.
803,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,"  Well, America is run  on alliance."
804,00:38:01.00,00:38:01.00,The minute somebody gives moneyto the president
805,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,"for his campaign as a lobbyist,  that's an alliance."
806,00:38:07.77,00:38:07.77,Don't tell mehe doesn't think
807,00:38:09.30,00:38:09.30,"  he doesn't owe  them anything,"
808,00:38:10.50,00:38:10.50, 'cause he does.
809,00:38:12.03,00:38:12.03,   They help put him   where he's at.
810,00:38:13.90,00:38:13.90,Same thing goeswhen people join a church
811,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"and they're not religious,"
812,00:38:17.33,00:38:17.33,but they join the church
813,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,"because they want to makeconnections for, be it"
814,00:38:21.63,00:38:21.63, they're an insurance agent
815,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,"   and want to sell more   insurance in town,"
816,00:38:24.53,00:38:24.53,   or they're a   real estate agent
817,00:38:25.53,00:38:25.53,and they want to sellreal estate.
818,00:38:27.47,00:38:27.47,So they want to meet upwith people.
819,00:38:29.80,00:38:29.80,   So there is goingto be alliance.
820,00:38:31.27,00:38:31.27, Don't tell methere ain't an alliance.
821,00:38:33.13,00:38:33.13," Well, Tagi, we lived together  for 20 days"
822,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,"  built a house, built a camp,  comfortable"
823,00:38:37.20,00:38:37.20," totally happy with each other,  like we ain't going to have"
824,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,  some kind of  bonding there.
825,00:38:41.83,00:38:41.83," Yeah, there's going to be alliances."
826,00:38:44.00,00:38:44.00,This is just a chess game.
827,00:38:45.43,00:38:45.43,It's the way life goes.
828,00:38:46.83,00:38:46.83,JEFF:Richard.
829,00:38:47.83,00:38:47.83, According to Colleen and Sue
830,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,there isan alliance.
831,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,   Is there? Geez...
832,00:38:52.50,00:38:52.50, is there a way to break the alliance right now?
833,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,  If you were looking at  this from the outside
834,00:38:57.93,00:38:57.93,  is there a way  to break it?
835,00:38:59.47,00:38:59.47, I have no idea who is
836,00:39:01.07,00:39:01.07,"completely trustworthy,   who isn't."
837,00:39:03.23,00:39:03.23, I think there's always a way
838,00:39:05.43,00:39:05.43,   that things   could break down.
839,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,   ( sputters lips )
840,00:39:08.57,00:39:08.57, Who knows what's going   to happen.
841,00:39:10.03,00:39:10.03,It's all a game.
842,00:39:12.43,00:39:12.43," All right, it's time to vote."
843,00:39:14.63,00:39:14.63," Gervase, you're up."
844,00:39:31.47,00:39:31.47,"  My vote is for Sean,"
845,00:39:33.20,00:39:33.20,as Sean has made a huge mistake
846,00:39:35.13,00:39:35.13,   in not seeing that  Tagi had an alliance
847,00:39:36.77,00:39:36.77," from day three on this island,"
848,00:39:38.47,00:39:38.47,  and he couldn't evensee anything happening.
849,00:39:40.43,00:39:40.43,"  So, for a smart guy,he has no common sense,"
850,00:39:42.77,00:39:42.77," no brains in his head, really,   when it comes down to it."
851,00:39:46.03,00:39:46.03,So Sean really deserves   this vote.
852,00:40:14.03,00:40:14.03,Hmm. I wonder how you spell it.
853,00:40:16.10,00:40:16.10, I don't know.
854,00:40:17.77,00:40:17.77,"  Anyways, you're a nice guy, I wish you the best of luck..."
855,00:40:23.03,00:40:23.03, but I'm tired of getting beat
856,00:40:25.63,00:40:25.63,"  at the competitions  by you, guy, so..."
857,00:40:46.87,00:40:46.87," I think Sean was, uh--"
858,00:40:48.40,00:40:48.40,   I hope this is how you spell your name--
859,00:40:50.43,00:40:50.43,"  pretty pathetic, this week  because, uh, first he goes,"
860,00:40:53.10,00:40:53.10,"""I'm looking outfor everybody's best interest,"""
861,00:40:55.63,00:40:55.63,and now he's looking out for his own interest.
862,00:40:58.07,00:40:58.07,   I think if anybody shouldget voted off this time
863,00:41:00.90,00:41:00.90,   it should be him   without question.
864,00:41:02.40,00:41:02.40,  He's a putz.
865,00:41:07.10,00:41:07.10,I'll go tally the votes.
866,00:41:24.50,00:41:24.50,"  Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final."
867,00:41:27.07,00:41:27.07,The person will be asked
868,00:41:28.43,00:41:28.43,to leave the tribal council area  immediately.
869,00:41:30.83,00:41:30.83,  I'll read the votes.
870,00:41:35.40,00:41:35.40,   First vote...
871,00:41:37.20,00:41:37.20,"""Sean."""
872,00:41:47.20,00:41:47.20," ""Sean."""
873,00:41:51.83,00:41:51.83,"   ""Gervase."""
874,00:42:01.60,00:42:01.60,"  ""Gervase."""
875,00:42:04.50,00:42:04.50,Two votesfor Gervase;
876,00:42:06.10,00:42:06.10, two votes for Sean.
877,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,"  ""Gervase."""
878,00:42:21.37,00:42:21.37,"  ""Gervase."""
879,00:42:23.37,00:42:23.37,  I won't read  the last vote.
880,00:42:24.70,00:42:24.70,It's irrelevant.
881,00:42:25.77,00:42:25.77,   Gervase...
882,00:42:26.93,00:42:26.93, I need you to bring me your staff.
883,00:42:42.23,00:42:42.23,   The tribe has spoken.
884,00:42:49.23,00:42:49.23,   It's time for   you to go.
885,00:42:50.57,00:42:50.57,Bye.
886,00:43:09.50,00:43:09.50,"   JEFF:   Well, you have   survived another one."
887,00:43:12.10,00:43:12.10,   We're down to six
888,00:43:13.53,00:43:13.53,   getting close   to our final two.
889,00:43:15.33,00:43:15.33,You guys can head back to camp.
890,00:43:17.07,00:43:17.07,   See you tomorrow.

899,00:43:55.07,00:43:55.07, of the Tagi alliance.
900,00:43:56.47,00:43:56.47,   When I turn aroundand see somebody
901,00:43:58.07,00:43:58.07,starting to dig a knifeinto my backside
902,00:43:59.97,00:43:59.97, it just really pisses me off.
903,00:44:07.20,00:44:07.20,"First off, I'd like to saythat I don't have..."
904,00:44:10.47,00:44:10.47,"hold any, like...ill feelings"
905,00:44:12.53,00:44:12.53, towards Rich and Sue and anybody in Tagi
906,00:44:14.37,00:44:14.37, for making an alliance and picking us off one by one.
907,00:44:18.10,00:44:18.10, It's just that my tribe didn't want to do that.
908,00:44:21.07,00:44:21.07, They wanted to keep it as an open game--
909,00:44:23.13,00:44:23.13," fair is fair, and let the best person end up winning"
910,00:44:25.87,00:44:25.87,the million dollars.
