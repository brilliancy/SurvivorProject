2,00:00:01.97,00:00:01.97,   ANNOUNCER:  16 Americans marooned    for 39 days
3,00:00:05.43,00:00:05.43, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:08.37,00:00:08.37,"  Separated into two tribes,  Tagi and Pagong"
5,00:00:11.47,00:00:11.47,  they competed against each  other to remain on the island.
6,00:00:14.43,00:00:14.43,  But now the tribes   have merged into one.
7,00:00:16.80,00:00:16.80," Rattana is the name, and it is     everyone for themselves."
8,00:00:20.80,00:00:20.80,  Every third night
9,00:00:22.30,00:00:22.30,  the entire tribe will hike   deep into the jungle
10,00:00:24.87,00:00:24.87, to take part   in the tribal council
11,00:00:26.83,00:00:26.83,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
12,00:00:30.43,00:00:30.43,"  In the end, one will remain"
13,00:00:32.67,00:00:32.67,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.
14,00:00:39.73,00:00:39.73,  Last week on Survivor...
15,00:00:42.30,00:00:42.30,  Kelly began to have doubts about her role in the alliance.
16,00:00:45.67,00:00:45.67, KELLY:   If we stick with it
17,00:00:47.43,00:00:47.43,  it's just like lining lambs     to the slaughter.
18,00:00:49.50,00:00:49.50,   Who goes next? Who goes...  that's no fun.
19,00:00:51.97,00:00:51.97,   ANNOUNCER:   And tension mounted    when Rudy burned the food.
20,00:00:54.87,00:00:54.87," Pathetic, burnt"
21,00:00:56.13,00:00:56.13,"   overdone, wasteful, again."
22,00:00:57.90,00:00:57.90,   ANNOUNCER:   Colleen won  the reward challenge...
23,00:00:59.77,00:00:59.77,  and invited Jenna    to a barbecue meal
24,00:01:02.87,00:01:02.87,  where a plan was hatched   to vote Rich off the island.
25,00:01:05.60,00:01:05.60,"  You, me and Gervase could definitely"
26,00:01:07.03,00:01:07.03,do something.
27,00:01:08.10,00:01:08.10,So let's do it.
28,00:01:10.03,00:01:10.03,   ANNOUNCER:  But it wasn't a picnic  back at Rattana
29,00:01:12.30,00:01:12.30, where Rich let it all hang out     on his birthday.
30,00:01:14.57,00:01:14.57," RUDY: When I go home, my wife asks me  about, well, who was with you"
31,00:01:18.37,00:01:18.37,I'll say a queer that ran around   bare-assed half of the time.
32,00:01:21.60,00:01:21.60,"   ANNOUNCER:  At tribal council, the three     former members of Pagong"
33,00:01:24.80,00:01:24.80,  tried to vote Rich  off the island.
34,00:01:26.97,00:01:26.97," Happy birthday, Rich."
35,00:01:28.37,00:01:28.37, And Kelly broke    the voting alliance
36,00:01:30.10,00:01:30.10,leaving them only three strong.
37,00:01:32.97,00:01:32.97,  But it was Sean who became     the unknowing swing vote
38,00:01:35.60,00:01:35.60," his alphabetical voting     strategy,"
39,00:01:37.53,00:01:37.53, casting the death vote    for Jenna.
40,00:01:39.80,00:01:39.80,  Last vote...
41,00:01:41.53,00:01:41.53,"""J"" for ""Jenna."""
42,00:01:44.83,00:01:44.83,   ANNOUNCER:  Seven people left...
43,00:01:45.87,00:01:45.87, who will be voted off tonight?
44,00:01:48.13,00:01:48.13,  Captioning sponsored by CBS and SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
45,00:03:07.77,00:03:07.77, KELLY:   It's weird the day   after anybody leaves
46,00:03:10.93,00:03:10.93," there's just,    there's just this void of,"
47,00:03:14.00,00:03:14.00," ""Oh, wait,"" you know,  ""someone's..."
48,00:03:16.33,00:03:16.33,"  someone's not here."""
49,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10, RUDY:    Gervase was going to get  voted off the last time
50,00:03:21.03,00:03:21.03, but at the last minute     they changed it to Jenna.
51,00:03:24.27,00:03:24.27,And I think that    that was the women's idea.
52,00:03:27.27,00:03:27.27," SUSAN:   The sun is out, it's going   to be a nice hot day."
53,00:03:30.53,00:03:30.53,  And it's quieter.
54,00:03:31.87,00:03:31.87," Sorry, Jenna,    but, man, you talk a lot."
55,00:03:37.70,00:03:37.70,  Do you guys   agree with me?
56,00:03:39.83,00:03:39.83,  I mean she is very   hard to live with.
57,00:03:41.67,00:03:41.67, You guys lived with  her longer than me
58,00:03:43.77,00:03:43.77,  and I don't know how she stayed on your team till you got over here.
59,00:03:46.43,00:03:46.43, I thought she would have went    a lot sooner than she did.
60,00:03:48.83,00:03:48.83,  Everybody did.
61,00:03:50.47,00:03:50.47,"   We've been here for    what, 28, 29 days now"
62,00:03:51.97,00:03:51.97,and I don't think people realize
63,00:03:54.00,00:03:54.00,   that it's 28 days    with people 24/7.
64,00:03:57.23,00:03:57.23, You know what I mean?
65,00:03:58.37,00:03:58.37,   There's no break.
66,00:03:59.37,00:03:59.37,It really is up in the air
67,00:04:00.90,00:04:00.90,you never know who's going next. And that why I love it.
68,00:04:03.10,00:04:03.10,You can think you're going
69,00:04:04.57,00:04:04.57,but then the surprise comes
70,00:04:06.10,00:04:06.10, 'cause I thought I was going.
71,00:04:09.10,00:04:09.10,GERVASE:  It's like 11 days left.
72,00:04:10.90,00:04:10.90,  I'm totally shocked that     I'm still here right now.
73,00:04:13.33,00:04:13.33,   If you look at it    since the merger
74,00:04:14.60,00:04:14.60,  it's only been Pagong people being voted off.
75,00:04:16.43,00:04:16.43,"  You know, so it's like...    something's fishy going on."
76,00:04:20.23,00:04:20.23,"You know, they can deny    an alliance all they want"
77,00:04:22.67,00:04:22.67, but there's got to be   an alliance.
78,00:04:26.40,00:04:26.40," SEAN:  No, I'm not 100% sure."
79,00:04:27.97,00:04:27.97,"  If there is an alliance,   they are just voting in block"
80,00:04:30.40,00:04:30.40,but I don't know if there is one.
81,00:04:31.83,00:04:31.83,I haven't been asked to partake in one or anything yet.
82,00:04:34.17,00:04:34.17, Dirk got four votes.
83,00:04:35.87,00:04:35.87,  Gretchen got four votes.
84,00:04:37.47,00:04:37.47, Greg got four votes.
85,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13," Sean, come on, open your eyes."
86,00:04:41.97,00:04:41.97,  Sean is interesting because
87,00:04:44.77,00:04:44.77, I'm debating right now    if I want to vote him off
88,00:04:46.77,00:04:46.77,  at the next council.
89,00:04:47.93,00:04:47.93, Because he's so scared
90,00:04:49.47,00:04:49.47, of hurting somebody's feelings    by voting for them
91,00:04:51.80,00:04:51.80,  that he's voting    alphabetical order.
92,00:04:53.47,00:04:53.47," I mean, he led the way"
93,00:04:54.70,00:04:54.70,for Jenna to be  kicked off yesterday.
94,00:04:56.27,00:04:56.27,"""J"" for ""Jenna."""
95,00:04:58.43,00:04:58.43,RICHARD:  And last night at the council
96,00:05:00.47,00:05:00.47,  Sean realized that his vote    impacted who gets voted off
97,00:05:05.47,00:05:05.47, because we only needed   to use three
98,00:05:08.13,00:05:08.13,   of our four allied  people's votes
99,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03, to get Jenna ejected.
100,00:05:12.63,00:05:12.63,   Whatever vote I was going  to go they were going to copy.
101,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83, If I knew that
102,00:05:16.27,00:05:16.27, I would certainly have abandoned this strategy earlier.
103,00:05:18.70,00:05:18.70, Everybody yelled at me    for doing this alphabet...
104,00:05:20.97,00:05:20.97,"  I thought I was being fair,   but actually"
105,00:05:22.80,00:05:22.80, I think I was targeting people
106,00:05:24.40,00:05:24.40,and also if they weren't  being targeted
107,00:05:26.70,00:05:26.70,  I was going to be targeted.
108,00:05:28.30,00:05:28.30," Because who the hell wants me    voting for them, you know?"
109,00:05:30.57,00:05:30.57,Either I was going to be out
110,00:05:32.20,00:05:32.20,"  or, or I would keep getting  other people's feelings hurt."
111,00:05:34.77,00:05:34.77,COLLEEN: It's like Sean walked into this
112,00:05:36.60,00:05:36.60,and somebody forgot to tell him  it was a game.
113,00:05:38.83,00:05:38.83, And he's very concerned  about people's emotions
114,00:05:41.07,00:05:41.07," and feelings,    which is wonderful"
115,00:05:42.57,00:05:42.57,"  you know, if you're   taking care of a pet."
116,00:05:45.67,00:05:45.67,"You know, not if you're playing  a game called Survivor"
117,00:05:48.00,00:05:48.00,and the point of the game is to strategize and eliminate people.
118,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,  It just felt a little scummy    to me at the time
119,00:05:54.47,00:05:54.47,  but after last night where   the remaining tribe members
120,00:05:57.43,00:05:57.43," of both parties said  we really don't care,"
121,00:05:59.30,00:05:59.30,"  it's just a game,"
122,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,every single one of them
123,00:06:02.37,00:06:02.37,  has tried to form a strategy   with me personally.
124,00:06:08.83,00:06:08.83,RICHARD:  Now people are talking  about planning
125,00:06:10.77,00:06:10.77,  and plotting and strategy.
126,00:06:12.10,00:06:12.10,And it's just so funny.
127,00:06:14.60,00:06:14.60,"  So utterly, utterly,  utterly naive"
128,00:06:16.90,00:06:16.90,  that there would be any room left to plot or strategize now.
129,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17," Rich is very arrogant,    very cocky"
130,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50," and very, very overconfident."
131,00:06:28.10,00:06:28.10," And I thought, you know what"
132,00:06:29.53,00:06:29.53, let's take Rich down  a couple pegs.
133,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43,RICHARD:  I got bombarded
134,00:06:32.90,00:06:32.90,"at the council, at the immunity council."
135,00:06:34.97,00:06:34.97,Little alliance
136,00:06:36.03,00:06:36.03,tried to attack Richie on my birthday.
137,00:06:40.33,00:06:40.33,But I lived.
138,00:06:40.33,00:06:40.33,Now he's going to not fish no more.
139,00:06:42.50,00:06:42.50,How freaking funny would it have been if he got
140,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,"sent home on his birthday, though?"
141,00:06:45.87,00:06:45.87,I wasn't even expecting that.
142,00:06:47.37,00:06:47.37,  Rich was this close  to leaving last week.
143,00:06:49.80,00:06:49.80,That was a good feeling.
144,00:06:51.20,00:06:51.20,"  For me, it was just a great feeling."
145,00:06:52.80,00:06:52.80,  And you could see    it's affected Rich.
146,00:06:54.80,00:06:54.80,"  After those three votes,    Rich was..."
147,00:06:57.17,00:06:57.17, he couldn't believe it.
148,00:06:58.80,00:06:58.80,"   Rich even thinks I, uh..."
149,00:07:01.23,00:07:01.23,   formed an alliance against him last night.
150,00:07:03.80,00:07:03.80,Which I didn't.
151,00:07:04.83,00:07:04.83,"That's okay, no hard feelings."
152,00:07:07.37,00:07:07.37,I'll just catch less fish.
153,00:07:10.40,00:07:10.40,"We like the fish, Rich."
154,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,"Yeah, I thought you liked the fish, Gerv."
155,00:07:14.37,00:07:14.37,"Not as much as I thought you did, though."
156,00:07:22.40,00:07:22.40,RICHARD:   When I fish  is somewhat strategic.
157,00:07:25.67,00:07:25.67,  So I'm thinking to myself
158,00:07:27.07,00:07:27.07,  it would be a heck  of a lot more valuable
159,00:07:29.57,00:07:29.57," I guess to me, if I got fish"
160,00:07:32.40,00:07:32.40,  after a couple more folks    were gone.
161,00:07:34.37,00:07:34.37,And I'll limit the fish that I'm getting
162,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,so that I'm not out here    working my ass off
163,00:07:38.80,00:07:38.80,  and people just expect that   there will be lots of fish.
164,00:07:42.27,00:07:42.27,When we get down to the last four or five of us
165,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20,I'll feed us like kings.
166,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20,I can't wait.
167,00:07:45.93,00:07:45.93,   I can't wait.
168,00:07:47.30,00:07:47.30,  It ain't happening fast enough.
169,00:07:47.30,00:07:47.30,I know.
170,00:07:48.47,00:07:48.47, Enjoy your day.
171,00:07:49.47,00:07:49.47,"Okay, thanks, you be careful."
172,00:07:50.70,00:07:50.70,I'll see you later.
173,00:07:51.77,00:07:51.77,"  All right, bye-bye."
174,00:07:55.20,00:07:55.20, SUSAN:    I don't blame him one bit  for not worrying about fishing
175,00:07:58.07,00:07:58.07,   till there's five people.
176,00:07:59.53,00:07:59.53, That's a lot of mouths to feed  and they don't appreciate it.
177,00:08:10.70,00:08:10.70,RICHARD:   There are analogies between     my going out to the reef
178,00:08:13.77,00:08:13.77, and hunting the fish
179,00:08:15.37,00:08:15.37, and my picking off the tribe    members one by one.
180,00:08:19.23,00:08:19.23, I've been stalking them since   before we got on the island.
181,00:08:28.10,00:08:28.10," Bye-bye, baby.     (Gulps )"
182,00:08:32.23,00:08:32.23," it's a slow, more methodical  game here on the island"
183,00:08:35.57,00:08:35.57, with each of the tribe members     than it is with the fish
184,00:08:38.40,00:08:38.40,  but there are similarities.
185,00:08:40.60,00:08:40.60, That's probably the last fish  I'll get until there are five.
186,00:08:43.73,00:08:43.73, There are seven participants     right now
187,00:08:45.67,00:08:45.67,  and I probably won't bother   to get any more fish
188,00:08:47.67,00:08:47.67,  until there are five people.
189,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83, SUSAN:   Colleen and Gervase    are just sitting over there
190,00:09:01.20,00:09:01.20," and I'm like,    ""You backstabbers."""
191,00:09:04.63,00:09:04.63,"First you want him out of here,"
192,00:09:06.13,00:09:06.13,and then you're    all over the food.
193,00:09:09.43,00:09:09.43,   I'm getting    filled up tonight    on one bowl.
194,00:09:10.80,00:09:10.80, That's sad.
195,00:09:12.40,00:09:12.40,   ( burps )
196,00:09:13.97,00:09:13.97," Ooh, good rice,  Rudy."
197,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,"Go, Suzy, go."
198,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,You're the best.
199,00:09:17.10,00:09:17.10,I got some nice belches    out here.
200,00:09:18.60,00:09:18.60, My strategy all along
201,00:09:20.20,00:09:20.20, has been to just play the role    as a dumb redneck.
202,00:09:23.33,00:09:23.33,( belches )
203,00:09:24.77,00:09:24.77,"   there you go,    Suzy Q."
204,00:09:26.60,00:09:26.60, SUSAN:   People like think rednecks    are so vulnerable and dumb
205,00:09:29.57,00:09:29.57, they'll talk to them openly.
206,00:09:32.07,00:09:32.07, Like Rich did.
207,00:09:34.10,00:09:34.10,   ( laughs )
208,00:09:35.47,00:09:35.47,"you know, how he's going    to burn everybody."
209,00:09:37.00,00:09:37.00,"Okay, so here's the deal."
210,00:09:39.70,00:09:39.70,"I want you to pick her to be ejected, not me."
211,00:09:42.27,00:09:42.27,So you can plan that.
212,00:09:43.93,00:09:43.93, SUSAN:  Hopefully in the end
213,00:09:45.87,00:09:45.87," the, the old redneck will burn    the city slickers."
214,00:09:49.20,00:09:49.20,   So we'll see what happens.
215,00:09:50.77,00:09:50.77,"You know, I think it would be best"
216,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,"is if we can, me and you"
217,00:09:55.07,00:09:55.07, can take care of...  take him out  at the end.
218,00:09:57.10,00:09:57.10,Take Rich out?
219,00:09:57.10,00:09:57.10,Yeah.
220,00:09:58.63,00:09:58.63,Just me and you.
221,00:10:00.33,00:10:00.33,  I've been knowing all along    that I'm going to burn him
222,00:10:02.77,00:10:02.77,but I didn't want to say   anything to Kelly too early.
223,00:10:05.30,00:10:05.30,   Why do you think he got    so many votes against him
224,00:10:07.10,00:10:07.10,at the last council?
225,00:10:08.27,00:10:08.27,"He's a snake. I got to thank him, though"
226,00:10:10.73,00:10:10.73,for getting our crap together early.
227,00:10:12.53,00:10:12.53,"If it wasn't for him, we might not have"
228,00:10:14.20,00:10:14.20,gotten together this early.
229,00:10:15.70,00:10:15.70, I never trusted Rich.
230,00:10:16.73,00:10:16.73, Of course I don't trust him.
231,00:10:18.17,00:10:18.17,  But am I doing a good job
232,00:10:19.60,00:10:19.60, making him think I trust him?
233,00:10:21.27,00:10:21.27, I hope it looks   like I trust him now.
234,00:10:23.97,00:10:23.97,I knew he was working on you to get me out anyway.
235,00:10:26.37,00:10:26.37,"   Oh, yeah."
236,00:10:27.80,00:10:27.80,   He's not that    ... smart.
237,00:10:29.70,00:10:29.70,Right now I don't trust anybody     except for Kelly.
238,00:10:32.00,00:10:32.00,  I trust Kelly 100%.
239,00:10:34.23,00:10:34.23,"100%, And she trusts me    the same."
240,00:10:36.43,00:10:36.43,  We're like sisters.
241,00:10:37.73,00:10:37.73,I want me and you to take him out.
242,00:10:39.43,00:10:39.43, I think so.
243,00:10:40.50,00:10:40.50,Just the three of us.
244,00:10:41.67,00:10:41.67,   But you got    to let him...
245,00:10:42.67,00:10:42.67,I really would.
246,00:10:43.67,00:10:43.67,I would feel good.
247,00:10:45.07,00:10:45.07,I would feel so good about myself.
248,00:10:46.77,00:10:46.77, KELLY:    I really like Sue a lot.
249,00:10:48.43,00:10:48.43,We've bonded quite a bit    in these 30 days.
250,00:10:51.67,00:10:51.67, And it'll be 20 years come this Easter
251,00:10:53.57,00:10:53.57,  that I lost my best friend.
252,00:10:55.27,00:10:55.27,"  So, coming across Kelly,    somebody I can hang with..."
253,00:10:59.37,00:10:59.37,that's a long...    I ain't going to ... her.
254,00:11:03.90,00:11:03.90,  I'm not burning her.
255,00:11:09.97,00:11:09.97, KELLY:  The only person I trust
256,00:11:11.53,00:11:11.53," is Sue, and sometimes   I doubt that."
257,00:11:15.30,00:11:15.30,   It's getting to that point
258,00:11:16.73,00:11:16.73,  where you don't know    who you can trust.
259,00:11:19.73,00:11:19.73,RICHARD:  But I got to remember
260,00:11:21.17,00:11:21.17, it's a game.  And I believe them.
261,00:11:23.20,00:11:23.20,"  I believe you,   I believe her."
262,00:11:24.83,00:11:24.83,And I believe Kelly.
263,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,   But I don't know if Kelly   is as solid as that
264,00:11:29.33,00:11:29.33,"  all the way through,    I hope so."
265,00:11:30.47,00:11:30.47,   I'm betting on it.
266,00:11:31.70,00:11:31.70,I was betting on it by bringing  her into this.
267,00:11:33.83,00:11:33.83,And I'm feeling very good about Sue.
268,00:11:36.00,00:11:36.00,  If they're not
269,00:11:37.60,00:11:37.60, then they're brilliant because they've played me well.
270,00:11:40.00,00:11:40.00, They've played me beautifully.
271,00:11:41.83,00:11:41.83, SUSAN:  I'd rather just me and Kelly     burn him.
272,00:11:44.70,00:11:44.70, Just because    it'll feel so good.
273,00:11:48.50,00:11:48.50,RICHARD:  If the alliance    were to break down
274,00:11:51.97,00:11:51.97,  and something else happened  that I wasn't aware of
275,00:11:54.50,00:11:54.50, I would shake those people's   hands and say congratulations
276,00:11:57.40,00:11:57.40,"  you, you know, brilliant"
277,00:11:58.93,00:11:58.93,"  good job, you got it"
278,00:12:00.53,00:12:00.53,   because you've fooled me.
279,00:12:02.60,00:12:02.60,  Me and Kelly   are taking him down.
280,00:12:20.67,00:12:20.67,  Watch out for that.
281,00:12:23.03,00:12:23.03, Hark!
282,00:12:23.03,00:12:23.03, Uh-oh.
283,00:12:24.33,00:12:24.33,A cigar!    A message!
284,00:12:26.13,00:12:26.13,RICHARD: Uh-oh.
285,00:12:27.17,00:12:27.17,"Oh, shut up."
286,00:12:28.73,00:12:28.73, Only one cigar?
287,00:12:29.73,00:12:29.73,Are we going to have to roll 'em?
288,00:12:31.97,00:12:31.97,"   No, there's more."
289,00:12:32.97,00:12:32.97,Yee-hah!
290,00:12:32.97,00:12:32.97,Whoo!
291,00:12:36.57,00:12:36.57,"   Roll that bad boy,    light that bad boy"
292,00:12:38.80,00:12:38.80,smokin'!
293,00:12:40.37,00:12:40.37,Awesome!
294,00:12:40.37,00:12:40.37,Yeah!
295,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,   Okay.
296,00:12:43.33,00:12:43.33,"""This is an announcement  for Gervase..."
297,00:12:45.60,00:12:45.60,  ( gasping ): Gervase!
298,00:12:46.73,00:12:46.73, Yay!
299,00:12:46.73,00:12:46.73,Nah-uh.
300,00:12:48.63,00:12:48.63,"Yay, Gervase!"
301,00:12:51.97,00:12:51.97, About your son.
302,00:12:54.27,00:12:54.27,"   ""Gunner Peterson was born  yesterday at 3:05..."""
303,00:12:58.10,00:12:58.10,"Hey, everybody, it's a boy!"
304,00:12:59.73,00:12:59.73,   Smoke up!
305,00:13:01.27,00:13:01.27,   Smoke up.
306,00:13:03.43,00:13:03.43,RICHARD: I didn't even know Gerv was having another baby.
307,00:13:06.63,00:13:06.63,GERVASE:    It's real simple.
308,00:13:08.00,00:13:08.00,I have two kids  from a previous relationship:
309,00:13:11.20,00:13:11.20,"   Dawnelle's ten,    Genelle is seven."
310,00:13:13.37,00:13:13.37,I'm with Carmela now
311,00:13:14.87,00:13:14.87, Kayla with her and now Gunner.
312,00:13:16.57,00:13:16.57," You know, Kayla's two  and Gunner's the new addition."
313,00:13:19.40,00:13:19.40,Four kids-- holy Moses.
314,00:13:22.90,00:13:22.90,"Now are you and, uh, Gunner"
315,00:13:25.87,00:13:25.87,and Kayla's mom together   permanently?
316,00:13:28.77,00:13:28.77,"   GERVASE:    Nah, never    been married."
317,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,"Yeah, we have some rough spots"
318,00:13:33.00,00:13:33.00,  we need to fix that
319,00:13:34.33,00:13:34.33,"so we're just smoothing   those out, you know."
320,00:13:37.57,00:13:37.57," RUDY:  When I was brought up,  if a girl was pregnant"
321,00:13:40.97,00:13:40.97,"  and wasn't married,"
322,00:13:42.30,00:13:42.30,  you'd never even know it.
323,00:13:44.37,00:13:44.37,"  I mean, they'd take her out   of town or somewhere."
324,00:13:46.57,00:13:46.57,"  It was that bad, you know."
325,00:13:47.97,00:13:47.97, The girl could have  had an abortion.
326,00:13:51.77,00:13:51.77, I-I'll agree with an abortion.
327,00:13:57.50,00:13:57.50,  But not having kids out of wedlock.
328,00:13:59.80,00:13:59.80,  It's a huge responsibility.
329,00:14:01.57,00:14:01.57, Huge.
330,00:14:03.03,00:14:03.03,"It's hard enough for one family, much less two."
331,00:14:05.40,00:14:05.40,"   Yeah, one child's    a huge responsibility"
332,00:14:06.77,00:14:06.77, let alone two.
333,00:14:08.03,00:14:08.03,Four kids between two families.
334,00:14:21.70,00:14:21.70,"No way, man."
335,00:14:22.77,00:14:22.77," Oh, no way."
336,00:14:25.10,00:14:25.10,Is it empty?
337,00:14:26.63,00:14:26.63, It's empty.
338,00:14:28.13,00:14:28.13,"   Oh, what a..."
339,00:14:31.60,00:14:31.60,Aah...
340,00:14:31.60,00:14:31.60,"Oh, man."
341,00:14:34.10,00:14:34.10,"  Oh, my god."
342,00:14:35.27,00:14:35.27,WOMEN: Pizza!
343,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,You were talking about pizza.
344,00:14:39.60,00:14:39.60," ""An oven fresh pizza, doesn't that sound nice?"
345,00:14:43.20,00:14:43.20,"  ""A phone call's been placed,    steady feet win a slice."""
346,00:14:47.30,00:14:47.30,Some balancing crap.
347,00:14:48.47,00:14:48.47,It's going to be  some balance.
348,00:14:50.07,00:14:50.07," ""Steady feet,""  could it be hot coals?"
349,00:14:53.03,00:14:53.03,No.
350,00:14:53.03,00:14:53.03,No.
351,00:14:54.70,00:14:54.70," ""A phone call's been placed,""  they called Pizza Hut."
352,00:14:58.50,00:14:58.50,That's what that means.
353,00:15:04.40,00:15:04.40,Uh...
354,00:15:10.60,00:15:10.60,Day 28 on the island
355,00:15:12.30,00:15:12.30,  and after almost   a month of nothing
356,00:15:14.37,00:15:14.37,rewards are everything.
357,00:15:17.03,00:15:17.03,Today's reward challenge is very simple:
358,00:15:19.20,00:15:19.20,Simply stay on your feet   long enough
359,00:15:21.03,00:15:21.03,to make it from one end   of the course to the other.
360,00:15:23.77,00:15:23.77,   For the winner--    a phone call home
361,00:15:25.23,00:15:25.23," with the Ericsson world phone,  to the person of their choice"
362,00:15:28.70,00:15:28.70,"  plus a slice of hot pizza,     delivered by helicopter."
363,00:15:34.37,00:15:34.37,"   Hi, Jeff."
364,00:15:35.37,00:15:35.37,"   What's up, G?"
365,00:15:36.43,00:15:36.43,Sean.
366,00:15:37.90,00:15:37.90,   What's happening?
367,00:15:38.93,00:15:38.93, Congratulations on your baby.
368,00:15:40.37,00:15:40.37,"Thank you, sir."
369,00:15:41.80,00:15:41.80,JEFF: That's great news.
370,00:15:42.90,00:15:42.90,The game is very simple.
371,00:15:45.63,00:15:45.63,  You're moving across  bamboo poles.
372,00:15:46.93,00:15:46.93, The first one to the end wins.
373,00:15:48.43,00:15:48.43,   Speed and balance are key.
374,00:15:50.43,00:15:50.43, There's going to be three legs   to the race.
375,00:15:53.30,00:15:53.30," In the first leg, the fastest    four will move on;"
376,00:15:56.47,00:15:56.47," in the second leg, the fastest    two will move on."
377,00:15:59.40,00:15:59.40,The third leg is for the prize.
378,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,Let's go.
379,00:16:24.93,00:16:24.93,"   Survivors, ready?!"
380,00:16:26.07,00:16:26.07, Go!
381,00:16:30.30,00:16:30.30,( shrieks )
382,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,Yeah.
383,00:16:35.13,00:16:35.13,  ( clapping )
384,00:16:36.73,00:16:36.73, JEFF:  Had to stay on.
385,00:16:38.07,00:16:38.07,"  Ah, come on."
386,00:16:39.33,00:16:39.33, You had to stay up.
387,00:16:43.77,00:16:43.77,  We're looking for two here.
388,00:16:45.47,00:16:45.47,"  Survivors, ready?!"
389,00:16:47.33,00:16:47.33, Go!
390,00:16:50.53,00:16:50.53," Whoa, it's Rich  and... Gervase."
391,00:16:53.73,00:16:53.73," Sue, it was Gervase by a nose."
392,00:16:57.00,00:16:57.00,"   You're always    in there, though."
393,00:16:58.17,00:16:58.17,Yeah? That's all right.
394,00:16:59.40,00:16:59.40, JEFF:  Richard and Gervase
395,00:17:00.60,00:17:00.60, you have to get  across here.
396,00:17:02.40,00:17:02.40,"The first person here, the other guy's got to secede."
397,00:17:05.33,00:17:05.33, Don't push him off.
398,00:17:06.67,00:17:06.67,You got to land here
399,00:17:08.07,00:17:08.07,  and plant it   with two feet.
400,00:17:09.43,00:17:09.43,If you fall off
401,00:17:10.80,00:17:10.80,"the next guy gets a shot, you go back."
402,00:17:12.77,00:17:12.77,"   For the prize,    survivors ready?!"
403,00:17:14.07,00:17:14.07, Go!
404,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,Gervase.
405,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,  ( others cheering )
406,00:17:28.03,00:17:28.03,"baby, you're getting some pizza and a phone call home."
407,00:17:32.60,00:17:32.60,"   Good effort, man."
408,00:17:33.67,00:17:33.67,Good effort.
409,00:17:35.57,00:17:35.57,"  All right, Gervase,   here comes your pizza."
410,00:17:45.33,00:17:45.33,Is that it?
411,00:17:46.53,00:17:46.53,   That's it.
412,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,  Hang tight.
413,00:18:04.50,00:18:04.50,Oh...
414,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,Hot slice of cheese.
415,00:18:09.27,00:18:09.27,"   The middle of the    South China Sea,"
416,00:18:10.83,00:18:10.83,pizza delivered by a helicopter.
417,00:18:12.73,00:18:12.73,It is your slice to enjoy here.
418,00:18:15.13,00:18:15.13,So have at it.
419,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,"   Gerv, it's all yours."
420,00:18:18.67,00:18:18.67," Do not share, Gerv."
421,00:18:20.37,00:18:20.37,"Gerv, eat it."
422,00:18:23.07,00:18:23.07,Nobody wants it? Nobody wants it?
423,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,I want a bite.
424,00:18:29.57,00:18:29.57,I don't want any really.
425,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,Take a big bite.
426,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,"   Oh, yeah."
427,00:18:35.70,00:18:35.70,I know you're a big pizza fan.
428,00:18:37.27,00:18:37.27,"Thank you, Gerv."
429,00:18:38.27,00:18:38.27,This is plenty for me.
430,00:18:39.77,00:18:39.77,   Now finish it up.
431,00:18:40.87,00:18:40.87,GERVASE: That's a big slice.
432,00:18:42.93,00:18:42.93,"All right, Gerv."
433,00:18:47.23,00:18:47.23," JEFF:  Okay, Gervase, now for  the second part of the reward."
434,00:18:50.80,00:18:50.80,   We have a cell phone here.
435,00:18:52.07,00:18:52.07,"If I said you could make one phone call,"
436,00:18:54.20,00:18:54.20,who would you call?
437,00:18:55.77,00:18:55.77,Don't even say it.
438,00:18:57.80,00:18:57.80,"  Gervase, don't   even think it."
439,00:19:00.67,00:19:00.67,"   I'm going to call    Carmela, see how    the baby is."
440,00:19:02.73,00:19:02.73,  ALL:   Yay!
441,00:19:04.23,00:19:04.23,"   All right, it's 3:00 A.M.   In Jersey right now."
442,00:19:05.93,00:19:05.93,"We're not going    to call right now,"
443,00:19:07.20,00:19:07.20,"  waste it when she's asleep, may not answer."
444,00:19:08.77,00:19:08.77,"Tomorrow morning, I'll come back over to Rattana,"
445,00:19:11.20,00:19:11.20," I'll bring the phone,"
446,00:19:12.53,00:19:12.53,"we'll call home, talk to mom, see how things are going."
447,00:19:14.90,00:19:14.90,"  Sounds good, Jeff.   You the man."
448,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,Way to go.
449,00:19:17.20,00:19:17.20,"All right, enjoy your pizza."
450,00:19:53.73,00:19:53.73,Let's walk along this way.
451,00:20:04.93,00:20:04.93, RUDY:  Ten more days--    it'll all be over.
452,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,I'll probably never see these people again.
453,00:20:11.10,00:20:11.10,   The way I want it.
454,00:20:17.00,00:20:17.00,  Going to make my phone call  to my family.
455,00:20:21.07,00:20:21.07,"   See how everybody's doing,  make sure they're doing good."
456,00:20:25.57,00:20:25.57,  I certainly don't judge him
457,00:20:27.50,00:20:27.50, for being not married and having kids.
458,00:20:29.60,00:20:29.60,"I mean, he had one relationship,"
459,00:20:31.73,00:20:31.73,"and then he had another  relationship,"
460,00:20:33.40,00:20:33.40,   and he seems to be  in a relationship now
461,00:20:35.20,00:20:35.20,"  with a woman where he's had  two children,"
462,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83, and is working toward
463,00:20:38.63,00:20:38.63," a committed, long-term   relationship"
464,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,  to parent those children     together.
465,00:20:44.43,00:20:44.43,   I don't agree with babies  out of wedlock
466,00:20:47.07,00:20:47.07,"that kind of garbage, you know?"
467,00:20:50.20,00:20:50.20,"  Half of the problem they got  in this country today,"
468,00:20:52.73,00:20:52.73,there's no family life.
469,00:20:54.57,00:20:54.57,And then they're blaming   the schools.
470,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,  It starts way before them kids go to school.
471,00:21:01.50,00:21:01.50,  They need a family.
472,00:21:03.23,00:21:03.23,They need somebody beating them   in the head.
473,00:21:11.77,00:21:11.77, ( cell phone dialing )
474,00:21:13.87,00:21:13.87,   ( phone ringing )
475,00:21:17.07,00:21:17.07,CARMELA:  Hello?
476,00:21:18.07,00:21:18.07, Hello.
477,00:21:19.23,00:21:19.23,It's me.
478,00:21:20.87,00:21:20.87,   Are you all right?
479,00:21:21.87,00:21:21.87,  Huh?
480,00:21:22.93,00:21:22.93,   Are you all right?
481,00:21:24.07,00:21:24.07,   ( laughs )
482,00:21:27.07,00:21:27.07,  How are you?
483,00:21:28.30,00:21:28.30,   I'm fine.
484,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,How's the baby?
485,00:21:30.80,00:21:30.80,I'm sitting here with him in my arms
486,00:21:33.10,00:21:33.10,and Kayla's just kissing him.
487,00:21:35.00,00:21:35.00,"Like, all she does is play with his hair."
488,00:21:37.73,00:21:37.73,  Does he have a lot of hair?
489,00:21:40.37,00:21:40.37," Oh, yeah? Like Kayla?"
490,00:21:42.27,00:21:42.27,   Or more than her?
491,00:21:43.50,00:21:43.50,You want to talk to daddy?
492,00:21:44.77,00:21:44.77,"Say, ""Hi, daddy."""
493,00:21:45.83,00:21:45.83,Daddy.
494,00:21:46.90,00:21:46.90,"  Hey, Kayla!"
495,00:21:48.73,00:21:48.73,  What are you doing?
496,00:21:50.63,00:21:50.63, Daddy.
497,00:21:51.83,00:21:51.83,"Yeah, give him a kiss, say, ""Bye-bye."""
498,00:21:53.53,00:21:53.53,"Tell him, say, ""Bye-bye."""
499,00:21:56.40,00:21:56.40,   ( laughs )
500,00:21:57.70,00:21:57.70," What, she's in shock?  It's been that long?"
501,00:22:03.67,00:22:03.67,"COLLEEN:   I mean it's better  that he's not married,"
502,00:22:06.40,00:22:06.40,'cause he has issues right now with Carmela
503,00:22:08.53,00:22:08.53,and it's better that they're not married
504,00:22:10.50,00:22:10.50, than just get married and then have problems later on.
505,00:22:13.20,00:22:13.20," From talking to him the other  day, I kind of got the scoop,"
506,00:22:17.17,00:22:17.17,"and I'm sure you probably heard  a little more,"
507,00:22:19.40,00:22:19.40,"but the first girl he was with,"
508,00:22:21.20,00:22:21.20,he really tried to stay with her and everything
509,00:22:23.93,00:22:23.93,"especially for the kids,"
510,00:22:25.47,00:22:25.47,"  and she was kind of the one   who was just, like,"
511,00:22:27.43,00:22:27.43,"""Look, it's not going to work."""
512,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,"So, I think he-he's very    responsible with his kids."
513,00:22:32.03,00:22:32.03,   He's paying for the kids.
514,00:22:33.50,00:22:33.50,   He's spending time  with the kids.
515,00:22:34.90,00:22:34.90,   He's being a dad.
516,00:22:38.20,00:22:38.20,"   It wouldn't be my choice, but that's his,"
517,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,  and he's free to make that.
518,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,  I really am so proud of you.
519,00:22:49.20,00:22:49.20,I can't believe there's   11 days left
520,00:22:50.87,00:22:50.87,and you are still in it.
521,00:22:52.20,00:22:52.20,"I'm just trying to, uh,  finish it out."
522,00:22:55.80,00:22:55.80,I've taken care    of all your bills
523,00:22:57.40,00:22:57.40,   and all that other stuff.
524,00:22:58.83,00:22:58.83,"Well, let everybody know   I miss them."
525,00:23:00.47,00:23:00.47, Tell your mom I even miss her.
526,00:23:01.97,00:23:01.97," Yeah, unbelievable, isn't it?"
527,00:23:04.80,00:23:04.80,  I love you and Kay loves you  and Gunner loves you.
528,00:23:07.57,00:23:07.57,"And, uh, so... you know."
529,00:23:10.37,00:23:10.37,  I love you. Tell Gunner I love him.
530,00:23:12.17,00:23:12.17,  Tell Kay I love her.
531,00:23:13.47,00:23:13.47,   All right.
532,00:23:25.47,00:23:25.47,"Come on, let's see how his phone call went."
533,00:23:28.13,00:23:28.13,"  Oh, he's here?"
534,00:23:29.50,00:23:29.50,"   Oh, he's right there."
535,00:23:31.10,00:23:31.10,Tell us about the whole situation.
536,00:23:32.83,00:23:32.83,Talk to Carmela?
537,00:23:33.90,00:23:33.90," Yeah, she's  doing good."
538,00:23:35.87,00:23:35.87,"   He's doing good,    everybody's    just doing great."
539,00:23:46.67,00:23:46.67,"We seriously,"
540,00:23:48.87,00:23:48.87, seriously lucked out.
541,00:23:50.13,00:23:50.13, I have no idea  what I would have done
542,00:23:51.77,00:23:51.77,had I ended up on Pagong    in the beginning.
543,00:23:53.37,00:23:53.37,"Oh, me, too."
544,00:23:54.37,00:23:54.37,Committed suicide.
545,00:23:55.40,00:23:55.40, I'd have killed  somebody.
546,00:23:56.77,00:23:56.77,I could never have built    alliances
547,00:23:58.83,00:23:58.83,"such solid ones,    particularly, too."
548,00:24:01.10,00:24:01.10,   They're too flaky.
549,00:24:02.57,00:24:02.57,Changes with the wind.
550,00:24:05.00,00:24:05.00,"  Too immature, yeah,  is what it is."
551,00:24:07.50,00:24:07.50,"  Like, Kelly's even   a little flaky,   at moments."
552,00:24:11.33,00:24:11.33,"   She's doing well, though."
553,00:24:12.93,00:24:12.93,   Yeah.
554,00:24:13.93,00:24:13.93," I mean, for 22, she's amazing."
555,00:24:15.87,00:24:15.87," Oh, yeah,  yeah, yeah."
556,00:24:17.20,00:24:17.20,  I hope she's solid.
557,00:24:23.03,00:24:23.03, KELLY:   This is not what I thought     it was going to be like.
558,00:24:25.83,00:24:25.83,  It's not about surviving   the elements.
559,00:24:27.50,00:24:27.50, It's about surviving yourself.
560,00:24:29.80,00:24:29.80,  I didn't want to be a part  of the alliance
561,00:24:32.60,00:24:32.60,because I thought it was   conniving and dirty  and untrue to myself.
562,00:24:37.27,00:24:37.27,GERVASE:   I don't think Kelly really    wanted to make an alliance
563,00:24:40.70,00:24:40.70,  with anybody here in Tagi.
564,00:24:42.60,00:24:42.60,  I think they kind of    strong-armed Kelly
565,00:24:44.63,00:24:44.63,"into making an alliance and joining their team,"
566,00:24:47.53,00:24:47.53,"  and it's really affected her    personally, like,"
567,00:24:49.90,00:24:49.90, as a tug-of-war on the inside.
568,00:24:53.67,00:24:53.67," KELLY:  It's not worth it to feel like  ... for the rest of your life,"
569,00:24:58.63,00:24:58.63," um, for a little bit of money,   and your 15 minutes."
570,00:25:04.43,00:25:04.43," You know, I kind of feel like   Luke Skywalker, or something."
571,00:25:08.53,00:25:08.53,I crossed over to the dark side   for a moment.
572,00:25:11.60,00:25:11.60, I don't like playing the game     that way.
573,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,Does that feel like it fits your face okay?
574,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,Mm-hmm.
575,00:25:16.63,00:25:16.63, KELLY:  Making a deal with Rich
576,00:25:18.10,00:25:18.10, is kind of like making a deal  with the devil.
577,00:25:20.80,00:25:20.80,"  Then you know how to use it    to breath, or no?"
578,00:25:22.97,00:25:22.97, KELLY:  I decided a while ago
579,00:25:24.60,00:25:24.60, not to be part   of the big alliance.
580,00:25:29.17,00:25:29.17,It's automatic.
581,00:25:30.17,00:25:30.17,I don't know if I could do that.
582,00:25:32.17,00:25:32.17,You'd be surprised.
583,00:25:33.30,00:25:33.30,"Like right now, you are."
584,00:25:35.00,00:25:35.00, KELLY:  I've been pretty much    letting Rich think
585,00:25:39.33,00:25:39.33,"   that I'm still part of his little mind-game, follower thing"
586,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,"  the whole time, basically,     because I figured"
587,00:25:46.57,00:25:46.57,  if I did tell him     that I grew a conscience
588,00:25:49.67,00:25:49.67, and I didn't want to be    his little follower anymore
589,00:25:52.57,00:25:52.57,"  that he would turn around     and shut me down,"
590,00:25:55.57,00:25:55.57,"which I'm certain he would have,"
591,00:25:57.30,00:25:57.30,"so, I'm glad I didn't tell him."
592,00:26:01.03,00:26:01.03,RICHARD: You're seeming more down and more serious to me
593,00:26:04.40,00:26:04.40,toward the end.
594,00:26:05.40,00:26:05.40,Really?
595,00:26:06.40,00:26:06.40,Mm-hmm.
596,00:26:07.40,00:26:07.40,A lot more so than... early on.
597,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23, KELLY:   Do I just kind of roll over    and let Rich decide

600,00:26:19.83,00:26:19.83, Done.
601,00:26:25.63,00:26:25.63,  Hey!
602,00:26:32.00,00:26:32.00,"Wait, start at the beginning."
603,00:26:33.83,00:26:33.83,Did it start?
604,00:26:34.97,00:26:34.97,   Yeah.

610,00:26:54.60,00:26:54.60,   to talk with about voting   and about alliances.

612,00:27:02.20,00:27:02.20,"  I mean, because she could   really be in"
613,00:27:04.37,00:27:04.37, for forming an alliance  because you see her now

639,00:28:30.00,00:28:30.00,This is go-for-broke time.
640,00:28:32.03,00:28:32.03,This game is designed to figure out how much
641,00:28:33.87,00:28:33.87,you've learned since you've been on the island.
642,00:28:36.03,00:28:36.03,We've picked this beach
643,00:28:37.13,00:28:37.13,'cause it has a lot of driftwood.
644,00:28:38.70,00:28:38.70,The idea is building fire.
645,00:28:40.13,00:28:40.13,   You'll have    three minutes
646,00:28:41.60,00:28:41.60,   to go and collect    as much driftwood
647,00:28:42.67,00:28:42.67,and stack it.
648,00:28:44.13,00:28:44.13,You each have your own fire pit   and a weighted flag.
649,00:28:45.97,00:28:45.97,"  The second leg of the race, take your staffs"
650,00:28:48.67,00:28:48.67,"  go out in the water,    light them, come back here"
651,00:28:52.03,00:28:52.03, use your torch   to light your fire.

653,00:28:56.73,00:28:56.73,drops this and raises that-- immunity.

655,00:29:03.77,00:29:03.77,"Take a spot. This is one, two, three, four."
656,00:29:05.80,00:29:05.80,Should be seven of them.
657,00:29:13.40,00:29:13.40,"Survivors, ready?"
658,00:29:14.93,00:29:14.93,  Go!
659,00:29:17.37,00:29:17.37,   ( grunts )
660,00:29:29.73,00:29:29.73, JEFF:   Two minutes!
661,00:29:40.47,00:29:40.47,Your branches cannot be touching    the wick.
662,00:29:43.27,00:29:43.27,"  They can be right under it,  but they can't be touching it."
663,00:29:47.23,00:29:47.23," Five, four..."
664,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.20," three, two..."
665,00:29:51.47,00:29:51.47,  one.
666,00:29:55.40,00:29:55.40,Hold on to your staffs;   keep that thing above water.
667,00:29:58.53,00:29:58.53,"   Survivors, ready?!"
668,00:30:01.10,00:30:01.10,  Go!
669,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23, JEFF:    Remember to light from the base...
670,00:30:47.87,00:30:47.87,   from the fire pit.
671,00:30:50.63,00:30:50.63," That's it, Richard."
672,00:30:52.13,00:30:52.13,Okay. I got you.
673,00:30:53.30,00:30:53.30," JEFF: You got plenty of time, Gervase."
674,00:30:56.20,00:30:56.20,   It's going to take   a long time
675,00:30:57.20,00:30:57.20,for these fires to burn.
676,00:31:36.50,00:31:36.50, Yeah!
677,00:31:38.60,00:31:38.60,"  Oh, good job, Rich."
678,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17, I could cook some rice
679,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,"over here, though, if you want me to."
680,00:31:44.43,00:31:44.43,Immune!
681,00:32:31.57,00:32:31.57,GERVASE:  Rich got lucky   and won his challenge
682,00:32:34.40,00:32:34.40,"and now he's... oh, man!"
683,00:32:36.90,00:32:36.90,   Wait till you see him now.
684,00:32:38.43,00:32:38.43,  If you watch Rich   the rest of this day
685,00:32:40.53,00:32:40.53,  watch the arrogance
686,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00, and the swagger     he's walking around with
687,00:32:44.10,00:32:44.10,  'cause he won that immunity
688,00:32:45.50,00:32:45.50,  and he knows   he can't be touched tonight.
689,00:32:47.40,00:32:47.40,"  What, if anything,   should be said..."
690,00:32:49.80,00:32:49.80,  I think Rich is     the ringleader..
691,00:32:51.67,00:32:51.67," Or if he's not the ringleader,   then he's second in command."
692,00:32:55.87,00:32:55.87,"  If I have to say,   ""Do I know for a fact"
693,00:32:58.47,00:32:58.47,"  there's an alliance, and all this stuff is going on?"""
694,00:33:01.57,00:33:01.57,"  No, I don't know for a fact,  but I'm a smart guy, you know."
695,00:33:05.27,00:33:05.27,   I can see things and see    how things are happening.
696,00:33:10.37,00:33:10.37, KELLY:  I-I was talking to-to Colleen
697,00:33:12.47,00:33:12.47," and we were just, like,   ""This sucks!"""
698,00:33:14.57,00:33:14.57,"  You know,   especially for her and Gerv."
699,00:33:16.87,00:33:16.87,  It's like they know   they're leaving next
700,00:33:18.73,00:33:18.73, so they're just going  to sit around and wait
701,00:33:20.97,00:33:20.97,"you know, with a red dot  pointed to their head?"
702,00:33:23.23,00:33:23.23,You have to keep your eye out.
703,00:33:27.03,00:33:27.03," Gervase, what  are you making?"
704,00:33:28.87,00:33:28.87,I'm making costumes for tonight.
705,00:33:31.27,00:33:31.27,  My code name for tonight...
706,00:33:33.20,00:33:33.20,"is ""bull's-eye."""
707,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00," I'm otherwise known  as ""sitting duck."""
708,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,( snickering )
709,00:33:41.67,00:33:41.67,GERVASE:  I think Rich--
710,00:33:44.87,00:33:44.87, being the cocky person   that he is--
711,00:33:47.03,00:33:47.03,will think that they can get rid of me with three votes.
712,00:33:50.80,00:33:50.80,"  Now, Sean approached me,   saying he wouldn't, uh, mind"
713,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,"  making an alliance,    but he said"
714,00:33:58.20,00:33:58.20,  he would only do it    if Kelly joined us
715,00:33:59.97,00:33:59.97,  so it'd be a sure thing.
716,00:34:01.20,00:34:01.20,"...bringing, like, a bundle of sticks"
717,00:34:03.27,00:34:03.27,and every morning...
718,00:34:05.00,00:34:05.00,  so they really only had     their three core people:
719,00:34:07.00,00:34:07.00,"  Rudy, Rich and Sue"
720,00:34:08.47,00:34:08.47, who probably definitely  would be with the plan.
721,00:34:10.50,00:34:10.50," That leaves four other votes,  including mine"
722,00:34:14.03,00:34:14.03, that can go on somebody else.
723,00:34:16.67,00:34:16.67,  So somehow     we have to work on Kelly
724,00:34:18.50,00:34:18.50, and figure out   who she's voting for
725,00:34:20.30,00:34:20.30, and then maybe Colleen  can also vote for that person.
726,00:34:23.83,00:34:23.83,"   So, the best bet is Kelly."
727,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,   SUSAN:    Where's Kelly at?
728,00:34:27.20,00:34:27.20,I don't know.
729,00:34:31.07,00:34:31.07, KELLY:    I wish something exciting  would happen--
730,00:34:33.80,00:34:33.80,"  something shocking,  something that nobody expects."
731,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57,"  Well, sh..."
732,00:34:48.33,00:34:48.33, Looks like we got some thunderheads building out there.
733,00:34:52.03,00:34:52.03, Should provide  for an exciting night.
734,00:35:05.20,00:35:05.20,"We're preparing to, uh, batten down the hatches."
735,00:35:08.23,00:35:08.23, ( whistling )
736,00:35:09.80,00:35:09.80, SEAN:  There's going to  be a storm tonight.
737,00:35:19.70,00:35:19.70,  ( thunder rolling )
738,00:35:25.17,00:35:25.17,Kelly cut her own throat tonight
739,00:35:27.40,00:35:27.40, and it was a wonderful thing.
740,00:35:29.47,00:35:29.47,"She, uh, tried to align herself"
741,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,  to the kids her age
742,00:35:33.20,00:35:33.20, and was probably trying  to look a little nicer
743,00:35:35.40,00:35:35.40," to the other group,   but I have a feeling"
744,00:35:37.93,00:35:37.93, she's got more going on     with them
745,00:35:39.53,00:35:39.53, than she's letting on.
746,00:35:40.77,00:35:40.77,Whoo!
747,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43,"She doesn't realize we can see it, right through it."
748,00:35:46.20,00:35:46.20, Yeah. Yeah.
749,00:35:47.30,00:35:47.30,Not smart at all.
750,00:35:48.47,00:35:48.47,Too much playing.
751,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,   Yeah. That's not serious.
752,00:35:51.63,00:35:51.63,No.
753,00:35:52.70,00:35:52.70,It's serious for me.
754,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80,"Oh, it is for me, too."
755,00:35:55.80,00:35:55.80,RICHARD:  It'll be interesting.
756,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87, She could have consequences.
757,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,We haven't decided yet.
758,00:36:02.50,00:36:02.50,"  ""We."" Hmm..."
759,00:36:03.87,00:36:03.87,   ( sniffs )
760,00:36:21.13,00:36:21.13,( conch shell blowing )
761,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,   ( gong sounding )
762,00:36:32.67,00:36:32.67,we're going to go ahead  and bring our jury in
763,00:36:34.80,00:36:34.80,as you guys are sitting down.
764,00:36:38.13,00:36:38.13,Okay.
765,00:36:39.30,00:36:39.30,Sean.
766,00:36:40.57,00:36:40.57,I got to revisit
767,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,   the alphabet voting system
768,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,   because it had    a dramatic effect
769,00:36:46.90,00:36:46.90,on the vote
770,00:36:48.13,00:36:48.13,because it resulted in Jenna being ejected.
771,00:36:51.30,00:36:51.30,  What were your   thoughts when   you left here?
772,00:36:53.10,00:36:53.10," Uh, when we went back to camp,  I was pretty much devastated."
773,00:36:55.97,00:36:55.97, Everyone was around...  we hung around by the campfire
774,00:36:58.53,00:36:58.53," and uh, both the  remaining Pagong people"
775,00:37:01.03,00:37:01.03,and the remaining Tagi people urged me
776,00:37:02.90,00:37:02.90,"implored me to, uh, vote, um, in my own best interest--"
777,00:37:06.20,00:37:06.20,to get with the program.
778,00:37:07.57,00:37:07.57, In the immortal words
779,00:37:08.67,00:37:08.67,"of Sue, ""to get some balls."""
780,00:37:11.63,00:37:11.63,  And that's what I plan to do    from here on out.
781,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03," Kelly, we haven't talked much   about your strategy"
782,00:37:16.70,00:37:16.70,  in terms of voting.
783,00:37:18.07,00:37:18.07, You got to  have one at  this point.
784,00:37:19.43,00:37:19.43,Sure. Why not?
785,00:37:20.43,00:37:20.43,I think everybody does.
786,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83, What is it?  What's it  based on?
787,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,It's based on who's competition    and who's pissing me off.
788,00:37:26.10,00:37:26.10,( Colleen laughs )
789,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,"How about you, Colleen?"
790,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,"Actually, tonight I'd like to be  referred to as ""sitting duck."""
791,00:37:31.73,00:37:31.73," ""Sitting duck""?"
792,00:37:31.73,00:37:31.73,"Yes, thank you."
793,00:37:33.40,00:37:33.40,  You feel as though   you might be
794,00:37:34.67,00:37:34.67,   a target tonight?
795,00:37:35.97,00:37:35.97,  Definitely.    I'm just waiting.
796,00:37:37.47,00:37:37.47,   And that's based on what?
797,00:37:38.70,00:37:38.70, That's based on eyes and ears
798,00:37:41.77,00:37:41.77,and alliances and nonalliances.
799,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,Sue.
800,00:37:46.17,00:37:46.17,"Um, we're all sitting here."
801,00:37:48.37,00:37:48.37,We're adults.
802,00:37:49.97,00:37:49.97,"  This is a game, but the game also reflects a lot on real life"
803,00:37:55.80,00:37:55.80,and you always bring up   this alliance thing.
804,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,"  Well, America is run   on alliance."
805,00:38:01.00,00:38:01.00,The minute somebody gives money to the president
806,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,"for his campaign as a lobbyist,   that's an alliance."
807,00:38:07.77,00:38:07.77,Don't tell me he doesn't think
808,00:38:09.30,00:38:09.30,"  he doesn't owe   them anything,"
809,00:38:10.50,00:38:10.50, 'cause he does.
810,00:38:12.03,00:38:12.03,   They help put him    where he's at.
811,00:38:13.90,00:38:13.90,Same thing goes when people join a church
812,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"and they're not religious,"
813,00:38:17.33,00:38:17.33,but they join the church
814,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,"because they want to make connections for, be it"
815,00:38:21.63,00:38:21.63, they're an  insurance agent
816,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,"   and want to sell more    insurance in town,"
817,00:38:24.53,00:38:24.53,   or they're a    real estate agent
818,00:38:25.53,00:38:25.53,and they want to sell real estate.
819,00:38:27.47,00:38:27.47,So they want to meet up with people.
820,00:38:29.80,00:38:29.80,   So there is going to be alliance.
821,00:38:31.27,00:38:31.27, Don't tell me there ain't an alliance.
822,00:38:33.13,00:38:33.13," Well, Tagi, we lived together   for 20 days"
823,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,"  built a house, built a camp,   comfortable"
824,00:38:37.20,00:38:37.20," totally happy with each other,   like we ain't going to have"
825,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,  some kind of   bonding there.
826,00:38:41.83,00:38:41.83," Yeah, there's going  to be alliances."
827,00:38:44.00,00:38:44.00,This is just a chess game.
828,00:38:45.43,00:38:45.43,It's the way life goes.
829,00:38:46.83,00:38:46.83,JEFF: Richard.
830,00:38:47.83,00:38:47.83, According to  Colleen and Sue
831,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,there is an alliance.
832,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,   Is there? Geez...
833,00:38:52.50,00:38:52.50, is there a way to break  the alliance right now?
834,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,  If you were looking at   this from the outside
835,00:38:57.93,00:38:57.93,  is there a way   to break it?
836,00:38:59.47,00:38:59.47, I have no idea who is
837,00:39:01.07,00:39:01.07,"completely trustworthy,    who isn't."
838,00:39:03.23,00:39:03.23, I think there's  always a way
839,00:39:05.43,00:39:05.43,   that things    could break down.
840,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,   ( sputters lips )
841,00:39:08.57,00:39:08.57, Who knows what's going    to happen.
842,00:39:10.03,00:39:10.03,It's all a game.
843,00:39:12.43,00:39:12.43," All right, it's time to vote."
844,00:39:14.63,00:39:14.63," Gervase, you're up."
845,00:39:31.47,00:39:31.47,"  My vote is for Sean,"
846,00:39:33.20,00:39:33.20,as Sean has made a huge mistake
847,00:39:35.13,00:39:35.13,   in not seeing that   Tagi had an alliance
848,00:39:36.77,00:39:36.77," from day three on this island,"
849,00:39:38.47,00:39:38.47,  and he couldn't even see anything happening.
850,00:39:40.43,00:39:40.43,"  So, for a smart guy, he has no common sense,"
851,00:39:42.77,00:39:42.77," no brains in his head, really,    when it comes down to it."
852,00:39:46.03,00:39:46.03,So Sean really deserves    this vote.
853,00:40:14.03,00:40:14.03,Hmm. I wonder how you spell it.
854,00:40:16.10,00:40:16.10, I don't know.
855,00:40:17.77,00:40:17.77,"  Anyways, you're a nice guy,  I wish you the best of luck..."
856,00:40:23.03,00:40:23.03, but I'm tired of getting beat
857,00:40:25.63,00:40:25.63,"  at the competitions   by you, guy, so..."
858,00:40:46.87,00:40:46.87," I think Sean was, uh--"
859,00:40:48.40,00:40:48.40,   I hope this is how  you spell your name--
860,00:40:50.43,00:40:50.43,"  pretty pathetic, this week   because, uh, first he goes,"
861,00:40:53.10,00:40:53.10,"""I'm looking out for everybody's best interest,"""
862,00:40:55.63,00:40:55.63,and now he's looking out  for his own interest.
863,00:40:58.07,00:40:58.07,   I think if anybody should get voted off this time
864,00:41:00.90,00:41:00.90,   it should be him    without question.
865,00:41:02.40,00:41:02.40,  He's a putz.
866,00:41:07.10,00:41:07.10,I'll go tally the votes.
867,00:41:24.50,00:41:24.50,"  Once the votes are tallied,  the decision is final."
868,00:41:27.07,00:41:27.07,The person will be asked
869,00:41:28.43,00:41:28.43,to leave the tribal council area   immediately.
870,00:41:30.83,00:41:30.83,  I'll read the votes.
871,00:41:35.40,00:41:35.40,   First vote...
872,00:41:37.20,00:41:37.20,"""Sean."""
873,00:41:47.20,00:41:47.20," ""Sean."""
874,00:41:51.83,00:41:51.83,"   ""Gervase."""
875,00:42:01.60,00:42:01.60,"  ""Gervase."""
876,00:42:04.50,00:42:04.50,Two votes for Gervase;
877,00:42:06.10,00:42:06.10, two votes for Sean.
878,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,"  ""Gervase."""
879,00:42:21.37,00:42:21.37,"  ""Gervase."""
880,00:42:23.37,00:42:23.37,  I won't read   the last vote.
881,00:42:24.70,00:42:24.70,It's irrelevant.
882,00:42:25.77,00:42:25.77,   Gervase...
883,00:42:26.93,00:42:26.93, I need you to bring  me your staff.
884,00:42:42.23,00:42:42.23,   The tribe has spoken.
885,00:42:49.23,00:42:49.23,   It's time for    you to go.
886,00:42:50.57,00:42:50.57,Bye.
887,00:43:09.50,00:43:09.50,"   JEFF:    Well, you have    survived another one."
888,00:43:12.10,00:43:12.10,   We're down to six
889,00:43:13.53,00:43:13.53,   getting close    to our final two.
890,00:43:15.33,00:43:15.33,You guys can head back to camp.
891,00:43:17.07,00:43:17.07,   See you tomorrow.

899,00:43:52.70,00:43:52.70,COLLEEN:   I'm getting to see   the breakdown
900,00:43:55.07,00:43:55.07, of the Tagi alliance.
901,00:43:56.47,00:43:56.47,   When I turn around and see somebody
902,00:43:58.07,00:43:58.07,starting to dig a knife into my backside
903,00:43:59.97,00:43:59.97, it just really pisses me off.
904,00:44:07.20,00:44:07.20,"First off, I'd like to say that I don't have..."
905,00:44:10.47,00:44:10.47,"hold any, like... ill feelings"
906,00:44:12.53,00:44:12.53, towards Rich and Sue  and anybody in Tagi
907,00:44:14.37,00:44:14.37, for making an alliance  and picking us off one by one.
908,00:44:18.10,00:44:18.10, It's just that my tribe  didn't want to do that.
909,00:44:21.07,00:44:21.07, They wanted to keep it  as an open game--
910,00:44:23.13,00:44:23.13," fair is fair, and let  the best person end up winning"
911,00:44:25.87,00:44:25.87,the million dollars.
