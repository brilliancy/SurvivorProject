251,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,"food that we provide them, so Ialmost feel responsible for"
252,00:17:53.83,00:17:53.83,helping them be strong enough towin that challenge.

267,00:19:21.29,00:19:21.29,Like a little piece of heavenjust dropped right off the side
268,00:19:24.50,00:19:24.50,"of the road.>> They do it twice a year, this"
269,00:19:41.38,00:19:41.38,"religious ceremony where they,like, bless the cave water, sing"
270,00:19:46.42,00:19:46.42,"and pray, and it's just aceremonial occasion, and I was"
271,00:19:50.21,00:19:50.21,so grateful that that was partof the reward.
272,00:19:53.38,00:19:53.38,"And it was like, I mean, just aonce-in-a-lifetime thing that"
273,00:19:58.29,00:19:58.29,happened.( applause and cheers )
274,00:20:03.96,00:20:03.96,>> Whoo!>> I haven't had fresh water in
275,00:20:18.21,00:20:18.21,32 days.It was so cool and refreshing.

279,00:20:47.21,00:20:47.21,benefit us if we took the timeto learn about somebody else.
280,00:20:51.75,00:20:51.75,Because guaranteed there's atleast one thing that we have in
281,00:20:53.21,00:20:53.21,"common.>> Oh, my god!"
282,00:21:02.08,00:21:02.08,"Oh, my god!Are those biscuits?!"
283,00:21:05.33,00:21:05.33,It was unbelievable.The blanket was just full of
284,00:21:09.79,00:21:09.79,"fried chicken, meat loaf,biscuits-- I mean, I'm a"
285,00:21:12.88,00:21:12.88,Southern girl.I love chicken and biscuits.

292,00:21:34.50,00:21:34.50,I feel like I'm about toexplode.
293,00:21:37.25,00:21:37.25,">> Oh, gluttony is so good.Adam and Parvati without"
294,00:21:40.46,00:21:40.46,"Jonathan around are a lot morechilled out, and we got a chance"

296,00:21:46.88,00:21:46.88,just be really calm.>> I think we should do
297,00:22:08.17,00:22:08.17,something.>> All I know is I can't keep
298,00:22:11.46,00:22:11.46,feeding Adam and Parvati andhave them win.
299,00:22:14.50,00:22:14.50,">> You don't think it's fair, ina sense, to feed people like"

303,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,"So I think at this point, we'vetentatively decided to keep on"
304,00:22:37.08,00:22:37.08,"catching food, but maybe hidesome of it from Adam and"
305,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,Parvati.>> I think we should just throw

315,00:23:35.96,00:23:35.96,"beat you.And Adam is the biggest guy, and"
316,00:23:39.25,00:23:39.25,"he eats the most.And so the less food he eats,"
317,00:23:41.58,00:23:41.58,the more drained he gets.>> If you can't get your own
318,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,"food at this point, then maybeyou shouldn't be in the game."

324,00:24:15.42,00:24:15.42,But after we saw that Adam andParvati brought back so much
325,00:24:18.83,00:24:18.83,"food, we sort of felt bad.I think the hiding plan is sort"

409,00:30:55.79,00:30:55.79,camp.See you at tribal.
410,00:31:12.75,00:31:12.75,>> Immunity challenge was rightup my alley.
411,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,It was actually quite hilariousseeing people just eating it all
412,00:31:18.71,00:31:18.71,"over the place.>> Big old nut, isn't it?"
413,00:31:24.29,00:31:24.29,>> It's humongous.>> Big green nuts.
414,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,( laughter )>> How's your sister?
415,00:31:53.25,00:31:53.25,There's clearly something up.People don't really know exactly
416,00:31:56.12,00:31:56.12,"what to say to me, you know?Something is afoot, no question."
417,00:32:03.79,00:32:03.79,Something has shifted.How far it's shifted and how
418,00:32:06.71,00:32:06.71,"much time I have to correct theshift, I don't know."
419,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,"If they're going to vote Adamoff tonight, then I've got two"
420,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,"days.If they're going to vote me off,"
421,00:32:15.79,00:32:15.79,I've got a couple of hours andprobably not a hell of a lot of
422,00:32:18.21,00:32:18.21,chance.>> Yeah.
423,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,">> Great.>> Some people might be like,"
424,00:32:52.71,00:32:52.71,"oh, you know, Jonathan's aweasel and he... whatever,"
425,00:32:55.54,00:32:55.54,"weaseled his way in, but as faras locking up the final four, if"
426,00:32:59.92,00:32:59.92,"Jonathan wasn't in it, who wouldget it?"
427,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,>> He was the only one that weknew we could flip.
428,00:33:04.71,00:33:04.71,>> I understand that.I don't think you're a bad
429,00:33:06.83,00:33:06.83,"person for that at all.I think that was good strategy,"
430,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,"it was great strategy.But at this point, it doesn't"
431,00:33:11.96,00:33:11.96,matter.Why not have me or Parvati in
432,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,the fifth spot instead of... asopposed to Jonathan?
433,00:33:17.12,00:33:17.12,>> Right.It's a little bit weird for me
434,00:33:19.92,00:33:19.92,because I feel like I'm kind oflike the godfather or something
435,00:33:21.58,00:33:21.58,"arranging a hit on somebody andsomeone's asking, like, to take"
436,00:33:23.58,00:33:23.58,out one person or another.>> He doesn't deserve it.
437,00:33:26.08,00:33:26.08,>> The truth of the matter is Idon't know if I'm entirely
438,00:33:28.38,00:33:28.38,comfortable with it.I will do everything I can to
439,00:33:35.62,00:33:35.62,keep you here because thatserves my interest.
440,00:33:37.17,00:33:37.17,>> I appreciate it.>> If I can't...
441,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,">> Listen, clearly, the energyhas shifted."
442,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,"And, you know, obviously, mytime away was a bad time to be"
443,00:33:43.42,00:33:43.42,"away.You had a feast, you had guests,"
444,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,"you had food brought back foryou, and Parvati and Adam are"
445,00:33:49.29,00:33:49.29,"charming young people, they'recloser to your age than I am, et"
446,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,"cetera, et cetera.But let's... you know, let's not"
447,00:33:56.12,00:33:56.12,"be stupid, please.You know, I'm the perfect person"
448,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,to keep around.I'm not a threat in terms of
449,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,immunity.And I saved your hide.
450,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,And I was happy to do it becauseI felt like it made amends for
451,00:34:10.38,00:34:10.38,"my stepping away, you know, andthey're going to say anything"
452,00:34:13.83,00:34:13.83,"they can.Because if you fall for it, then"
453,00:34:16.79,00:34:16.79,"I'm gone, and they're stillaround in the game, waiting to"
454,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,take you guys out.It would be stupid to vote me
455,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,out because I came back and Isaved my alliances' lives.
456,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,Are they really going tosacrifice themselves and all
457,00:34:28.62,00:34:28.62,they've worked for becauseParvati is smiling at them now?
458,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,"You know, because Adam isstepping up and gathering a"
459,00:34:34.42,00:34:34.42,little bit of wood?>> Yeah.
460,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,"It's either Jonathan or Adam,because they seem to be the"
461,00:34:48.50,00:34:48.50,"biggest competitors right now.It's really hard to pick,"
462,00:34:53.04,00:34:53.04,"though, which one is worse.I think that, you know, as long"
463,00:34:55.96,00:34:55.96,as the girls stay... staycool...
464,00:34:59.29,00:34:59.29,I think they will.>> I think we're kind of set
465,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"anyways, right?>> We're set..."
466,00:35:02.62,00:35:02.62,>> I think the final four ispretty much...
467,00:35:04.25,00:35:04.25,"As long as no one does anythingcrazy and the girls break, we're"
468,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,there.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
469,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,"the members of our jury: Brad,Rebecca, Jenny, Nate, and"
470,00:35:39.50,00:35:39.50,"Candice, voted out at the lasttribal council."
471,00:35:47.79,00:35:47.79,"Pavarti, let's talk about thereward."
472,00:35:49.67,00:35:49.67,"Which was better, spending timewith your loved one or all that"
473,00:35:51.75,00:35:51.75,"food?>> Hands down, spending time"
474,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,"with my dad, you know.Seeing just the joy on their"
475,00:35:55.92,00:35:55.92,faces.They're so proud of us and what
476,00:35:57.71,00:35:57.71,"we're doing right now.You know, and then when we went"
477,00:36:00.21,00:36:00.21,"on the reward and we were, like,being celebrated with the"
478,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,"villagers, and biscuits, friedchicken, apple pie-- you can't"
479,00:36:06.88,00:36:06.88,"really beat it.>> PROBST: Adam, at this point"
480,00:36:09.42,00:36:09.42,"in the game, a good meal canhave a direct impact on the next"
481,00:36:12.75,00:36:12.75,"challenge.>> You know, Ozzy didn't go to"
482,00:36:15.58,00:36:15.58,"the reward and he won thechallenge, so I don't know if"
483,00:36:18.08,00:36:18.08,that's a good theory or not.But I think it's more of going
484,00:36:21.88,00:36:21.88,to Exile Island damages you forthe immunity challenge more than
485,00:36:26.75,00:36:26.75,getting the reward helps you.>> PROBST: Let's talk about
486,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"Exile Island.Parvati, why Jonathan?"
487,00:36:32.08,00:36:32.08,>> Sending Jonathan was astrategy move to keep myself in
488,00:36:34.88,00:36:34.88,the game as long as possible.I'm hoping that they'll begin to
489,00:36:39.00,00:36:39.00,"see, you know, life is betterwithout him and keep me and"
490,00:36:41.58,00:36:41.58,"Adam.>> PROBST: Ozzy, nice not having"
491,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,Jonathan around camp for awhile?
492,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,>> Sure.>> PROBST: Why?
493,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,">> Jonathan's got a very strongpersonality, and sometimes it's"
494,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,"hard to be around.>> PROBST: Jonathan, are you"
495,00:36:56.38,00:36:56.38,"learning stuff about yourselfthat you didn't know, or have"
496,00:36:58.58,00:36:58.58,you heard this kind of stuffbefore?
497,00:37:00.46,00:37:00.46,">> Well, I mean, I amdisappointed and surprised to"
498,00:37:03.08,00:37:03.08,hear that these two have had asmuch influence on these guys and
499,00:37:07.04,00:37:07.04,"that a day or two in camp, orthree or four, whatever, is"
500,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,going to throw out the trustthat I put in them and the flop
501,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,that I made for them.But I don't know if that's going
502,00:37:15.04,00:37:15.04,to happen.I really hope it doesn't.
503,00:37:17.96,00:37:17.96,">> Once again, Jeff, just likelast tribal council, no one"
504,00:37:21.92,00:37:21.92,wants Jonathan around.Just the fact that there's six
505,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,good people out here that reallydeserve to be here.
506,00:37:27.38,00:37:27.38,>> Why don't I deserve to behere?
507,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,>> Just your integrity.You don't have any.
508,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,"You flop all the time, and it'sfrustrating, every time we come"
509,00:37:33.88,00:37:33.88,"to tribal council to see themover there, and he should have"
510,00:37:36.88,00:37:36.88,been voted out each time theywere voted out.
511,00:37:39.42,00:37:39.42,">> You know, I beg to differ,okay."
512,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,All of the people that werevoted off from Raro were not
513,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,"voted off only by me, you know.I was in a desperate situation"
514,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,"where I had come over there, andit was their tribe mates who"
515,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,voted for them.>> PROBST: Do you feel a bit of
516,00:37:53.92,00:37:53.92,a debt is owed to you for savingthem and giving them the chance
517,00:37:56.42,00:37:56.42,to win this game when theydidn't have it?
518,00:37:58.83,00:37:58.83,">> Um, yes.Some of them would not be here"
519,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,tonight if I hadn't flopped.That's just the truth.
520,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,"But the fact is I have earnedmy right to sit here tonight,"
521,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,and I believe I have earned aright to sit here at the next
522,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,"tribal council.>> PROBST: Yul, Jonathan says"
523,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,"that he saved you guys, and yetI've heard you say that you"
524,00:38:16.79,00:38:16.79,saved Jonathan?Who saved who?
525,00:38:19.54,00:38:19.54,>> I think we both saved eachother.
526,00:38:21.71,00:38:21.71,"I mean, our backs were againstthe wall, and we had to make"
527,00:38:23.62,00:38:23.62,moves out of desperation.So I would say collectively the
528,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,"four of us, the Aitutaki four,are in control of the game to"
529,00:38:30.50,00:38:30.50,the extent I have the idol and Ihave a lot of influence within

532,00:38:36.75,00:38:36.75,immunity necklace.I don't assume you're giving it
533,00:38:39.00,00:38:39.00,up to anybody.You cannot vote for Ozzy.
534,00:38:42.38,00:38:42.38,We also have the hidden immunityidol.
535,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"If whoever has it needs ittonight, you'd present it to me"
536,00:38:47.25,00:38:47.25,"after the vote.You would be safe, and the"
537,00:38:50.21,00:38:50.21,person with the next highestnumber of votes would be sent
538,00:38:52.04,00:38:52.04,home.It is time to vote.
539,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,"Becky, you're up.>> Uh, what can I say?"
540,00:39:12.04,00:39:12.04,You're the biggest threat to me.You deserve to go home.
541,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,>> ( whispering ): You shouldhave been voted out a long time
542,00:39:30.79,00:39:30.79,ago.Hopefully we got it right this
