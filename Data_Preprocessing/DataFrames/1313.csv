194,00:13:35.46,00:13:35.46,somebody winning this. Mike and Parvati are very close!
195,00:13:39.58,00:13:39.58,That flag is raising! You've got to hit the wood.
196,00:13:46.17,00:13:46.17,"Jonathan's flag is now raising. >> Right here, baby!"
197,00:13:53.83,00:13:53.83,>> PROBST: It's Jonathan and Parvati.
198,00:13:59.21,00:13:59.21,"Parvati wins reward! >> Good job, Parvati."
199,00:14:08.79,00:14:08.79,">> I'm sorry, baby. >> Damn it!"
200,00:14:13.25,00:14:13.25,>> PROBST: Nice job. >> Thank you.
201,00:14:15.21,00:14:15.21,>> PROBST: First order of business: you have to choose one
202,00:14:17.12,00:14:17.12,of these six to leave right now and go to Exile Island.
203,00:14:20.62,00:14:20.62,>> Jonathan. >> PROBST: Jonathan not even
204,00:14:28.21,00:14:28.21,asking permission. He's taking a good-bye.
205,00:14:37.88,00:14:37.88,>> Love you. >> PROBST: Now to the more fun
206,00:14:47.88,00:14:47.88,part of the reward. Two other survivors...
207,00:14:51.25,00:14:51.25,( laughter ) ...and their loved ones will
208,00:14:55.12,00:14:55.12,"join you on this reward. And, Mike, you're going to"
209,00:14:59.21,00:14:59.21,decide who it is with no help from you.
210,00:15:02.17,00:15:02.17,>> Oh...! >> PROBST: No talking from the
211,00:15:04.12,00:15:04.12,survivors. Who are you taking with you?
212,00:15:07.29,00:15:07.29,">> Oh, man. Uh..."
213,00:15:12.04,00:15:12.04,"Oh... Island lady, Jeanette."
214,00:15:18.96,00:15:18.96,">> Oh, beautiful ladies! >> PROBST: Jeanette, Sundra,"
215,00:15:23.08,00:15:23.08,come over here. ( applause )
216,00:15:26.88,00:15:26.88,"One more choice. >> George, right?"
217,00:15:31.25,00:15:31.25,">> PROBST: Adam's dad, George. >> Yes!"
218,00:15:38.75,00:15:38.75,">> PROBST: Loved ones, it's been a pleasure having you here."
219,00:15:41.00,00:15:41.00,It's time for you guys to go. You can head back the way you
220,00:15:42.58,00:15:42.58,"came in. Well, the good news is you're"
221,00:15:49.08,00:15:49.08,all going back to camp together. >> Yay!
222,00:15:53.25,00:15:53.25,">> PROBST: Sundra, Adam, Parvati, loved ones, boat will"
223,00:15:56.88,00:15:56.88,"pick you up in a few hours, take you to your reward."
224,00:15:59.38,00:15:59.38,"All right, take them back to camp, guys."
225,00:16:21.33,00:16:21.33,>> So you're back at camp. Do you believe I've been here
226,00:16:24.21,00:16:24.21,for 31 days? >> Yeah.
227,00:16:25.92,00:16:25.92,">> I was, like, squealing and jumping up and down when I won"
228,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,"because it was just so unexpected, but I needed it."
229,00:16:32.25,00:16:32.25,"It showed me that I am still in this game and, you know, that"
230,00:16:35.21,00:16:35.21,I still have a fighting chance. This is home.
231,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,I'll give you a tour. Here's the living room.
232,00:16:41.54,00:16:41.54,">> I'm really glad because I couldn't describe this in words,"
233,00:16:43.92,00:16:43.92,I don't think. It was great to see George here.
234,00:16:46.38,00:16:46.38,"George is my dad, and I call him George because he's my best"
235,00:16:50.04,00:16:50.04,friend. I'm surprised I lasted this
236,00:16:52.12,00:16:52.12,"long. >> Well, I'm proud of you,"
237,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,"buddy. >> I told you, don't..."
238,00:16:56.79,00:16:56.79,The chances of me lasting past tomorrow are slim.
239,00:17:04.12,00:17:04.12,>> Okay. >> I could get into this.
240,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,">> Yes, for a day. I think having my mom come here"
241,00:17:11.42,00:17:11.42,"and see it, it's going to give her a whole new perspective that"
242,00:17:15.17,00:17:15.17,I probably could never get across.
243,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,"I mean, this is something that my mom probably would never have"
244,00:17:20.42,00:17:20.42,had in her whole lifetime. >> Interesting.
245,00:17:23.08,00:17:23.08,"That's what we have to drink? >> Yes, we boil it."
246,00:17:25.21,00:17:25.21,So I think actually we're going to get some tonight because we
247,00:17:27.50,00:17:27.50,filled up our water bottles. >> Want to see the house where
248,00:17:31.50,00:17:31.50,we sleep? >> Yeah.
249,00:17:36.96,00:17:36.96,>> That's awesome! ( laughter )
250,00:17:43.25,00:17:43.25,>> It's kind of annoying having the camp be overrun with the
251,00:17:46.12,00:17:46.12,competitors' family. Parvati and Adam depend on the
252,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,"food that we provide them, so I almost feel responsible for"
253,00:17:53.83,00:17:53.83,helping them be strong enough to win that challenge.
254,00:18:00.75,00:18:00.75,>> Here it comes. You ready?
255,00:18:07.08,00:18:07.08,">> All right, bye-bye. >> Bye."
256,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67,">> Have a good time. >> Bye, guys."
257,00:18:10.21,00:18:10.21,">> See you guys later. >> Me, too."
258,00:18:25.12,00:18:25.12,>> Yeah! >> It's really nice.
259,00:18:26.33,00:18:26.33,>> I agree. >> Laid back.
260,00:18:31.04,00:18:31.04,>> Exactly! >> It was unbelievable.
261,00:18:55.25,00:18:55.25,"We got greeted by at least 100 people, women and children, just"
262,00:18:59.00,00:18:59.00,"singing to us and, like, we were celebrated."
263,00:19:01.75,00:19:01.75,It was fabulous. I loved it.
264,00:19:08.54,00:19:08.54,">> We have no idea what they're singing, you know."
265,00:19:10.21,00:19:10.21,It's just amazing. The little kids are around us.
266,00:19:12.71,00:19:12.71,"And then they walk us to this cave, and in this cave, there's"
267,00:19:17.33,00:19:17.33,"fresh water. It was, like oh, my god!"
268,00:19:21.29,00:19:21.29,Like a little piece of heaven just dropped right off the side
269,00:19:24.50,00:19:24.50,"of the road. >> They do it twice a year, this"
270,00:19:41.38,00:19:41.38,"religious ceremony where they, like, bless the cave water, sing"
271,00:19:46.42,00:19:46.42,"and pray, and it's just a ceremonial occasion, and I was"
272,00:19:50.21,00:19:50.21,so grateful that that was part of the reward.
273,00:19:53.38,00:19:53.38,"And it was like, I mean, just a once-in-a-lifetime thing that"
274,00:19:58.29,00:19:58.29,happened. ( applause and cheers )
275,00:20:03.96,00:20:03.96,>> Whoo! >> I haven't had fresh water in
276,00:20:18.21,00:20:18.21,32 days. It was so cool and refreshing.
277,00:20:21.25,00:20:21.25,"And when I came up, our skin smelled nice because of the oil."
278,00:20:24.12,00:20:24.12,It felt so good. ( cheers )
279,00:20:44.33,00:20:44.33,">> The world is getting much smaller, and it would only"
280,00:20:47.21,00:20:47.21,benefit us if we took the time to learn about somebody else.
281,00:20:51.75,00:20:51.75,Because guaranteed there's at least one thing that we have in
282,00:20:53.21,00:20:53.21,"common. >> Oh, my god!"
283,00:21:02.08,00:21:02.08,"Oh, my god! Are those biscuits?!"
284,00:21:05.33,00:21:05.33,It was unbelievable. The blanket was just full of
285,00:21:09.79,00:21:09.79,"fried chicken, meat loaf, biscuits-- I mean, I'm a"
286,00:21:12.88,00:21:12.88,Southern girl. I love chicken and biscuits.
287,00:21:15.92,00:21:15.92,I am so glad I won that challenge.
288,00:21:18.75,00:21:18.75,>> As you should. >> That is good.
289,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,">> Oh, my god! >> Go for it, Adam."
290,00:21:26.79,00:21:26.79,>> Got to beat Jonathan tomorrow.
291,00:21:28.67,00:21:28.67,That's our goal for the rest of the time we're here.
292,00:21:31.04,00:21:31.04,We just have to beat him at everything.
293,00:21:34.50,00:21:34.50,I feel like I'm about to explode.
294,00:21:37.25,00:21:37.25,">> Oh, gluttony is so good. Adam and Parvati without"
295,00:21:40.46,00:21:40.46,"Jonathan around are a lot more chilled out, and we got a chance"
296,00:21:44.04,00:21:44.04,"to just talk, find out a little bit more about each other and"
297,00:21:46.88,00:21:46.88,just be really calm. >> I think we should do
298,00:22:08.17,00:22:08.17,something. >> All I know is I can't keep
299,00:22:11.46,00:22:11.46,feeding Adam and Parvati and have them win.
300,00:22:14.50,00:22:14.50,">> You don't think it's fair, in a sense, to feed people like"
301,00:22:16.21,00:22:16.21,"your enemies. >> No, I understand."
302,00:22:27.38,00:22:27.38,"Ozzy catches pretty much most of our food, and Adam and"
303,00:22:30.50,00:22:30.50,Parvati keep on winning these challenges.
304,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,"So I think at this point, we've tentatively decided to keep on"
305,00:22:37.08,00:22:37.08,"catching food, but maybe hide some of it from Adam and"
306,00:22:40.33,00:22:40.33,Parvati. >> I think we should just throw
307,00:22:46.00,00:22:46.00,them in the woods. >> Right there.
308,00:22:54.17,00:22:54.17,">> Now is a key, pivotal moment, and I don't want to feed people"
309,00:22:57.75,00:22:57.75,"that beat me. So for Adam, Parvati, and"
310,00:23:00.42,00:23:00.42,"Jonathan, no more coconuts. They can go get their own."
311,00:23:21.83,00:23:21.83,>> How was it? >> Hi!
312,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,">> Hi, Parvati. >> Hi, guys."
313,00:23:28.12,00:23:28.12,How are you? >> Tell us all about it.
314,00:23:30.29,00:23:30.29,">> This is a survival game, so the issue is just trying to have"
315,00:23:32.79,00:23:32.79,an upper edge in the game and not feeding someone so they can
316,00:23:35.96,00:23:35.96,"beat you. And Adam is the biggest guy, and"
317,00:23:39.25,00:23:39.25,"he eats the most. And so the less food he eats,"
318,00:23:41.58,00:23:41.58,the more drained he gets. >> If you can't get your own
319,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,"food at this point, then maybe you shouldn't be in the game."
320,00:23:57.21,00:23:57.21,">> Oh, my god! Oh, my..."
321,00:23:59.92,00:23:59.92,Thank you! >> I'm not done yet.
322,00:24:02.58,00:24:02.58,">> Oh, my god! The original plan for Ozzy and"
323,00:24:09.29,00:24:09.29,"myself and also Yul was to sort of hide the coconuts, hide the"
324,00:24:12.75,00:24:12.75,"food, you know, to save it for us for later."
325,00:24:15.42,00:24:15.42,But after we saw that Adam and Parvati brought back so much
326,00:24:18.83,00:24:18.83,"food, we sort of felt bad. I think the hiding plan is sort"
327,00:24:22.46,00:24:22.46,"of on the outs. >> Guys, thank you, seriously."
328,00:24:27.83,00:24:27.83,>> People seem more chilled out if we're just our six without
329,00:24:30.67,00:24:30.67,"Jonathan, so it's sort of nice that he's on Exile right now."
330,00:24:35.46,00:24:35.46,">> Oh, Yul's going to cry! ( laughter )"
331,00:24:48.42,00:24:48.42,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Jonathan"
332,00:24:55.58,00:24:55.58,"returning from Exile Island. >> Thanks, guys."
333,00:25:11.21,00:25:11.21,"Hi, guys. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get"
334,00:25:15.04,00:25:15.04,to today's challenge? >> Yeah.
335,00:25:16.08,00:25:16.08,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: First things first,"
336,00:25:17.54,00:25:17.54,"Adam, take back the necklace. >> No more bling-bling, huh?"
337,00:25:23.54,00:25:23.54,>> PROBST: Once again immunity back up for grabs.
338,00:25:26.79,00:25:26.79,"For today's challenge, you're going to race out into the water"
339,00:25:30.00,00:25:30.00,and maneuver across a series of obstacles.
340,00:25:33.50,00:25:33.50,"When you reach the end, you'll retrieve a bundle of sticks and"
341,00:25:36.29,00:25:36.29,race back. You must then go out and do this
342,00:25:38.71,00:25:38.71,"a second time. Once you have both bundles back,"
343,00:25:42.08,00:25:42.08,"you'll untie the sticks and, using the rope and the sticks,"
344,00:25:46.04,00:25:46.04,"build one long pole, which you will then use to retrieve two"
345,00:25:50.12,00:25:50.12,rings. First person to retrieve both
346,00:25:52.58,00:25:52.58,"rings wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-six shot at winning"
347,00:25:58.04,00:25:58.04,this game and the million-dollar check that goes along with it.
348,00:26:02.12,00:26:02.12,"Losers, you know what happens: tribal council tonight."
349,00:26:04.96,00:26:04.96,Somebody going home. Make sense?
350,00:26:07.21,00:26:07.21,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
351,00:26:08.21,00:26:08.21,>> Absolutely. >> PROBST: We'll draw for spots
352,00:26:09.75,00:26:09.75,"and we'll get started. For immunity, survivors ready?"
353,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,Go! Ozzy leading the pack.
354,00:26:28.00,00:26:28.00,He's first to the platform. Yul up on the platform.
355,00:26:33.33,00:26:33.33,Jonathan right behind. Yul in the water.
356,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,He's got to go back to the platform.
357,00:26:41.50,00:26:41.50,Ozzy making quick work of this course.
358,00:26:44.46,00:26:44.46,"Not hesitating. Ozzy in the water, swimming out"
359,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,to his buoy. Yul and Jonathan right behind.
360,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83,"Becky, Pavarti, Sundra on the course."
361,00:26:59.88,00:26:59.88,"Yul across the barrels, hanging on!"
362,00:27:07.04,00:27:07.04,Ozzy heading back with his first bundle of sticks.
363,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,Yul swimming out to his bundle. Parvati and Sundra making their
364,00:27:20.04,00:27:20.04,way across the balance beams as Ozzy heads back.
365,00:27:23.75,00:27:23.75,Jonathan swimming out for his first bundle.
366,00:27:26.83,00:27:26.83,Adam slides across the barrel. Ozzy having no trouble.
367,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,Yul heading back with his first bundle.
368,00:27:39.67,00:27:39.67,Ozzy back with his first bundle. Becky and Parvati having a hard
369,00:27:43.92,00:27:43.92,time with the barrels. Jonathan heads back with his
370,00:27:49.17,00:27:49.17,first bundle. Adam working on the knots of his
371,00:27:52.21,00:27:52.21,first bundle while Ozzy is getting ready to lap him.
372,00:28:01.21,00:28:01.21,Yul swimming back with his first bundle of sticks.
373,00:28:05.75,00:28:05.75,Parvati struggling to hang on to that barrel.
374,00:28:09.17,00:28:09.17,Parvati off again. She's got to go back.
375,00:28:12.21,00:28:12.21,Yul's back with his first bundle.
376,00:28:15.17,00:28:15.17,Everybody is having a hard time with the barrels.
377,00:28:18.62,00:28:18.62,You're being too cautious. Attack this course.
378,00:28:24.92,00:28:24.92,Jonathan slides across the barrels.
379,00:28:31.79,00:28:31.79,Ozzy slides across the barrel and makes it.
380,00:28:34.62,00:28:34.62,Ozzy swimming for his second bundle.
381,00:28:37.33,00:28:37.33,Adam coming back with his first bundle.
382,00:28:39.96,00:28:39.96,Jonathan's heading back. Parvati makes it across.
383,00:28:48.17,00:28:48.17,She's swimming out for her first bundle.
384,00:28:51.21,00:28:51.21,"Ozzy's back on the course. Yul across the barrels, swimming"
385,00:29:05.21,00:29:05.21,"out for his second bundle. Ozzy passes Adam now, heading"
386,00:29:14.38,00:29:14.38,back with his second bundle. Jonathan taking his time.
387,00:29:22.12,00:29:22.12,Adam in no rush. Ozzy already untying his
388,00:29:25.17,00:29:25.17,"bundles, getting to work on his pole."
389,00:29:29.46,00:29:29.46,Yul takes a nose dive. Parvati off again.
390,00:29:34.04,00:29:34.04,Everybody falling. Sundra takes a hard fall on the
391,00:29:37.42,00:29:37.42,barrels. Lots of bumps and bruises.
392,00:29:42.29,00:29:42.29,"Adam back with his first bundle. Ozzy spacing it out, trying to"
393,00:29:46.67,00:29:46.67,get an idea of how much pole he has to work with.
394,00:29:50.62,00:29:50.62,Parvati back with her first bundle.
395,00:29:53.50,00:29:53.50,Yul back with his second bundle. He starts working on his pole.
396,00:29:59.38,00:29:59.38,Becky finally back with her first bundle of sticks.
397,00:30:02.96,00:30:02.96,Down to Ozzy and Yul. Who will get their pole together
398,00:30:06.17,00:30:06.17,first? Whose will be strong enough to
399,00:30:08.33,00:30:08.33,work? Ozzy's got his pole together.
400,00:30:13.88,00:30:13.88,Giving it a go. Ozzy with his first ring back.
401,00:30:22.33,00:30:22.33,Ozzy doing it all with the pole. Ozzy very close.
402,00:30:29.21,00:30:29.21,"Ozzy wins immunity! Ozzy, come on over."
403,00:30:38.21,00:30:38.21,( applause ) >> Good job.
404,00:30:40.75,00:30:40.75,">> PROBST: Once again, Ozzy is safe tonight at tribal council."
405,00:30:43.04,00:30:43.04,"Out of curiosity, anybody here overly concerned that by not"
406,00:30:46.38,00:30:46.38,winning they're in trouble tonight?
407,00:30:49.21,00:30:49.21,"Adam, Parvati. Well, we'll see if your concerns"
408,00:30:51.25,00:30:51.25,"are warranted. Tonight, tribal council,"
409,00:30:53.50,00:30:53.50,"somebody going home. Grab your stuff, head back to"
410,00:30:55.79,00:30:55.79,camp. See you at tribal.
411,00:31:12.75,00:31:12.75,>> Immunity challenge was right up my alley.
412,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,It was actually quite hilarious seeing people just eating it all
413,00:31:18.71,00:31:18.71,"over the place. >> Big old nut, isn't it?"
414,00:31:24.29,00:31:24.29,>> It's humongous. >> Big green nuts.
415,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,( laughter ) >> How's your sister?
416,00:31:53.25,00:31:53.25,There's clearly something up. People don't really know exactly
417,00:31:56.12,00:31:56.12,"what to say to me, you know? Something is afoot, no question."
418,00:32:03.79,00:32:03.79,Something has shifted. How far it's shifted and how
419,00:32:06.71,00:32:06.71,"much time I have to correct the shift, I don't know."
420,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,"If they're going to vote Adam off tonight, then I've got two"
421,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,"days. If they're going to vote me off,"
422,00:32:15.79,00:32:15.79,I've got a couple of hours and probably not a hell of a lot of
423,00:32:18.21,00:32:18.21,chance. >> Yeah.
424,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,">> Great. >> Some people might be like,"
425,00:32:52.71,00:32:52.71,"oh, you know, Jonathan's a weasel and he... whatever,"
426,00:32:55.54,00:32:55.54,"weaseled his way in, but as far as locking up the final four, if"
427,00:32:59.92,00:32:59.92,"Jonathan wasn't in it, who would get it?"
428,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,>> He was the only one that we knew we could flip.
429,00:33:04.71,00:33:04.71,>> I understand that. I don't think you're a bad
430,00:33:06.83,00:33:06.83,"person for that at all. I think that was good strategy,"
431,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,"it was great strategy. But at this point, it doesn't"
432,00:33:11.96,00:33:11.96,matter. Why not have me or Parvati in
433,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,the fifth spot instead of... as opposed to Jonathan?
434,00:33:17.12,00:33:17.12,>> Right. It's a little bit weird for me
435,00:33:19.92,00:33:19.92,because I feel like I'm kind of like the godfather or something
436,00:33:21.58,00:33:21.58,"arranging a hit on somebody and someone's asking, like, to take"
437,00:33:23.58,00:33:23.58,out one person or another. >> He doesn't deserve it.
438,00:33:26.08,00:33:26.08,>> The truth of the matter is I don't know if I'm entirely
439,00:33:28.38,00:33:28.38,comfortable with it. I will do everything I can to
440,00:33:35.62,00:33:35.62,keep you here because that serves my interest.
441,00:33:37.17,00:33:37.17,>> I appreciate it. >> If I can't...
442,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,">> Listen, clearly, the energy has shifted."
443,00:33:40.71,00:33:40.71,"And, you know, obviously, my time away was a bad time to be"
444,00:33:43.42,00:33:43.42,"away. You had a feast, you had guests,"
445,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,"you had food brought back for you, and Parvati and Adam are"
446,00:33:49.29,00:33:49.29,"charming young people, they're closer to your age than I am, et"
447,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,"cetera, et cetera. But let's... you know, let's not"
448,00:33:56.12,00:33:56.12,"be stupid, please. You know, I'm the perfect person"
449,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,to keep around. I'm not a threat in terms of
450,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,immunity. And I saved your hide.
451,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,And I was happy to do it because I felt like it made amends for
452,00:34:10.38,00:34:10.38,"my stepping away, you know, and they're going to say anything"
453,00:34:13.83,00:34:13.83,"they can. Because if you fall for it, then"
454,00:34:16.79,00:34:16.79,"I'm gone, and they're still around in the game, waiting to"
455,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,take you guys out. It would be stupid to vote me
456,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,out because I came back and I saved my alliances' lives.
457,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,Are they really going to sacrifice themselves and all
458,00:34:28.62,00:34:28.62,they've worked for because Parvati is smiling at them now?
459,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,"You know, because Adam is stepping up and gathering a"
460,00:34:34.42,00:34:34.42,little bit of wood? >> Yeah.
461,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,"It's either Jonathan or Adam, because they seem to be the"
462,00:34:48.50,00:34:48.50,"biggest competitors right now. It's really hard to pick,"
463,00:34:53.04,00:34:53.04,"though, which one is worse. I think that, you know, as long"
464,00:34:55.96,00:34:55.96,as the girls stay... stay cool...
465,00:34:59.29,00:34:59.29,I think they will. >> I think we're kind of set
466,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"anyways, right? >> We're set..."
467,00:35:02.62,00:35:02.62,>> I think the final four is pretty much...
468,00:35:04.25,00:35:04.25,"As long as no one does anything crazy and the girls break, we're"
469,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,there. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
470,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,"the members of our jury: Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, Nate, and"
471,00:35:39.50,00:35:39.50,"Candice, voted out at the last tribal council."
472,00:35:47.79,00:35:47.79,"Pavarti, let's talk about the reward."
473,00:35:49.67,00:35:49.67,"Which was better, spending time with your loved one or all that"
474,00:35:51.75,00:35:51.75,"food? >> Hands down, spending time"
475,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,"with my dad, you know. Seeing just the joy on their"
476,00:35:55.92,00:35:55.92,faces. They're so proud of us and what
477,00:35:57.71,00:35:57.71,"we're doing right now. You know, and then when we went"
478,00:36:00.21,00:36:00.21,"on the reward and we were, like, being celebrated with the"
479,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,"villagers, and biscuits, fried chicken, apple pie-- you can't"
480,00:36:06.88,00:36:06.88,"really beat it. >> PROBST: Adam, at this point"
481,00:36:09.42,00:36:09.42,"in the game, a good meal can have a direct impact on the next"
482,00:36:12.75,00:36:12.75,"challenge. >> You know, Ozzy didn't go to"
483,00:36:15.58,00:36:15.58,"the reward and he won the challenge, so I don't know if"
484,00:36:18.08,00:36:18.08,that's a good theory or not. But I think it's more of going
485,00:36:21.88,00:36:21.88,to Exile Island damages you for the immunity challenge more than
486,00:36:26.75,00:36:26.75,getting the reward helps you. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
487,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"Exile Island. Parvati, why Jonathan?"
488,00:36:32.08,00:36:32.08,>> Sending Jonathan was a strategy move to keep myself in
489,00:36:34.88,00:36:34.88,the game as long as possible. I'm hoping that they'll begin to
490,00:36:39.00,00:36:39.00,"see, you know, life is better without him and keep me and"
491,00:36:41.58,00:36:41.58,"Adam. >> PROBST: Ozzy, nice not having"
492,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,Jonathan around camp for a while?
493,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,>> Sure. >> PROBST: Why?
494,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,">> Jonathan's got a very strong personality, and sometimes it's"
495,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,"hard to be around. >> PROBST: Jonathan, are you"
496,00:36:56.38,00:36:56.38,"learning stuff about yourself that you didn't know, or have"
497,00:36:58.58,00:36:58.58,you heard this kind of stuff before?
498,00:37:00.46,00:37:00.46,">> Well, I mean, I am disappointed and surprised to"
499,00:37:03.08,00:37:03.08,hear that these two have had as much influence on these guys and
500,00:37:07.04,00:37:07.04,"that a day or two in camp, or three or four, whatever, is"
501,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,going to throw out the trust that I put in them and the flop
502,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,that I made for them. But I don't know if that's going
503,00:37:15.04,00:37:15.04,to happen. I really hope it doesn't.
504,00:37:17.96,00:37:17.96,">> Once again, Jeff, just like last tribal council, no one"
505,00:37:21.92,00:37:21.92,wants Jonathan around. Just the fact that there's six
506,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,good people out here that really deserve to be here.
507,00:37:27.38,00:37:27.38,>> Why don't I deserve to be here?
508,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,>> Just your integrity. You don't have any.
509,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,"You flop all the time, and it's frustrating, every time we come"
510,00:37:33.88,00:37:33.88,"to tribal council to see them over there, and he should have"
511,00:37:36.88,00:37:36.88,been voted out each time they were voted out.
512,00:37:39.42,00:37:39.42,">> You know, I beg to differ, okay."
513,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,All of the people that were voted off from Raro were not
514,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,"voted off only by me, you know. I was in a desperate situation"
515,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,"where I had come over there, and it was their tribe mates who"
516,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,voted for them. >> PROBST: Do you feel a bit of
517,00:37:53.92,00:37:53.92,a debt is owed to you for saving them and giving them the chance
518,00:37:56.42,00:37:56.42,to win this game when they didn't have it?
519,00:37:58.83,00:37:58.83,">> Um, yes. Some of them would not be here"
520,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,tonight if I hadn't flopped. That's just the truth.
521,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,"But the fact is I have earned my right to sit here tonight,"
522,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,and I believe I have earned a right to sit here at the next
523,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,"tribal council. >> PROBST: Yul, Jonathan says"
524,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,"that he saved you guys, and yet I've heard you say that you"
525,00:38:16.79,00:38:16.79,saved Jonathan? Who saved who?
526,00:38:19.54,00:38:19.54,>> I think we both saved each other.
527,00:38:21.71,00:38:21.71,"I mean, our backs were against the wall, and we had to make"
528,00:38:23.62,00:38:23.62,moves out of desperation. So I would say collectively the
529,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,"four of us, the Aitutaki four, are in control of the game to"
530,00:38:30.50,00:38:30.50,the extent I have the idol and I have a lot of influence within
531,00:38:32.42,00:38:32.42,"that. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
532,00:38:34.96,00:38:34.96,"to the vote. Ozzy, you have the individual"
533,00:38:36.75,00:38:36.75,immunity necklace. I don't assume you're giving it
534,00:38:39.00,00:38:39.00,up to anybody. You cannot vote for Ozzy.
535,00:38:42.38,00:38:42.38,We also have the hidden immunity idol.
536,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"If whoever has it needs it tonight, you'd present it to me"
537,00:38:47.25,00:38:47.25,"after the vote. You would be safe, and the"
538,00:38:50.21,00:38:50.21,person with the next highest number of votes would be sent
539,00:38:52.04,00:38:52.04,home. It is time to vote.
540,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,"Becky, you're up. >> Uh, what can I say?"
541,00:39:12.04,00:39:12.04,You're the biggest threat to me. You deserve to go home.
542,00:39:29.21,00:39:29.21,>> ( whispering ): You should have been voted out a long time
543,00:39:30.79,00:39:30.79,ago. Hopefully we got it right this
544,00:39:32.83,00:39:32.83,time. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
545,00:39:55.92,00:39:55.92,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
546,00:40:08.12,00:40:08.12,decision is final. The person voted out will be
547,00:40:09.88,00:40:09.88,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
548,00:40:12.17,00:40:12.17,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Jonathan."
549,00:40:20.46,00:40:20.46,"Adam. One vote Adam, one vote"
550,00:40:23.75,00:40:23.75,Jonathan. Jonathan.
551,00:40:28.92,00:40:28.92,"Two votes Jonathan, one vote Adam."
552,00:40:34.54,00:40:34.54,"Jonathan. Three votes Jonathan, one vote"
553,00:40:37.33,00:40:37.33,Adam. 14th person voted out and the
554,00:40:48.17,00:40:48.17,sixth member of our jury: Jonathan.
555,00:40:50.67,00:40:50.67,"That's four, that's enough, unless you have the hidden"
556,00:40:52.25,00:40:52.25,immunity idol. Please bring me your torch.
557,00:41:02.33,00:41:02.33,"Jonathan, the tribe has spoken. >> And I'd like my hat back at"
558,00:41:06.75,00:41:06.75,"some point. Good night, guys."
559,00:41:19.25,00:41:19.25,>> PROBST: Interesting tribal council.
560,00:41:20.92,00:41:20.92,"You vote out somebody who thought he could trust you,"
561,00:41:24.25,00:41:24.25,which now means trust should be an issue for every single person
562,00:41:28.50,00:41:28.50,left in this game. Grab your torches.
563,00:41:31.62,00:41:31.62,Head back to camp. Good night.

568,00:42:01.96,00:42:01.96,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
569,00:42:04.46,00:42:04.46,>> We're the underdogs. We got to fight.
570,00:42:05.92,00:42:05.92,>> I know. >> PROBST: Parvati and Adam
571,00:42:07.25,00:42:07.25,develop a plan. >> Is there any way you'd vote
572,00:42:09.25,00:42:09.25,any of them? >> I'm going to do whatever I
573,00:42:11.29,00:42:11.29,can to win. I don't care what that means.
574,00:42:14.58,00:42:14.58,>> I'm scared of Ozzy. >> PROBST: And Becky and Yul
575,00:42:16.92,00:42:16.92,consider turning on Ozzy. >> It's up to you.
576,00:42:18.25,00:42:18.25,I'll leave it... whichever way you want to do it.
577,00:42:26.04,00:42:26.04,>> These people are terrible liars-- terrible liars.
578,00:42:29.38,00:42:29.38,I wish they'd told me to my face but they didn't do that because
579,00:42:31.79,00:42:31.79,then there would be an argument and obviously they didn't want
580,00:42:34.17,00:42:34.17,to hear me talk anymore. So now they'll have a peaceful
581,00:42:36.29,00:42:36.29,camp and they'll have to deal with each other stabbing each
582,00:42:38.62,00:42:38.62,other in the back as if that's some new thing in the game of
583,00:42:40.83,00:42:40.83,Survivor. Four of those six people are
584,00:42:42.62,00:42:42.62,going to join me on the jury soon enough.
