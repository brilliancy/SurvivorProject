47,00:03:30.97,00:03:30.97,experienced here on Chaboga Mogo and I've got to be honest.
48,00:03:35.00,00:03:35.00,It's not really brightening my mood because the longer I stay
49,00:03:37.77,00:03:37.77,"here, the more I realize I have very few friends and now I'm"
50,00:03:41.70,00:03:41.70,stuck in a tribe with five other people who don't necessarily
51,00:03:46.30,00:03:46.30,"trust me or even like me, and it's very alienating."
52,00:03:51.00,00:03:51.00,It's really unpleasant out here. >> There you go.
53,00:03:55.93,00:03:55.93,"Oh, my God-- nice, fresh milk. >> That's it?"
54,00:03:59.03,00:03:59.03,">> Yup. I'm cooking, too."
55,00:04:01.83,00:04:01.83,"I'm not having plantains today. You want them, you can cook them"
56,00:04:04.13,00:04:04.13,yourself. I'm not eating them.
57,00:04:05.80,00:04:05.80,>> I'm just really tired of Jenna.
58,00:04:08.23,00:04:08.23,"I cannot stand her. The girl's a bitch, let's face"
59,00:04:12.83,00:04:12.83,"it, and, uh, she's bossier than anybody else here on this tribe."
60,00:04:16.77,00:04:16.77,">> I like eating off the fire, so just take it, put"
61,00:04:19.23,00:04:19.23,it on the log and then we'll eat it.
62,00:04:20.50,00:04:20.50,>> She drives me  crazy. I just wanna strangle her!
63,00:04:32.80,00:04:32.80,">> Rupert, you're the man. >> I had a couple of"
64,00:04:38.70,00:04:38.70,"them that got off the spear that were monsters, just"
65,00:04:43.03,00:04:43.03,monsters. I'd like to gut these guys.
66,00:04:46.47,00:04:46.47,"We'll come back and get 'em, clean 'em and eat 'em."
67,00:04:52.33,00:04:52.33,"When I came out of the ocean, I realized that nobody was going"
68,00:04:57.33,00:04:57.33,"to help me clean fish, but they all want to eat the fish."
69,00:05:03.67,00:05:03.67,I'm feeling used and abused. If somebody comes up and asks
70,00:05:08.47,00:05:08.47,"which fish is theirs, I'll probably tell them the one that"
71,00:05:11.30,00:05:11.30,they caught and the one that they cleaned.
72,00:05:14.97,00:05:14.97,>> We usually get one fish per person.
73,00:05:17.53,00:05:17.53,">> If everybody gutted one, they'd be all done."
74,00:05:21.30,00:05:21.30,">> Rupert catches all the fish, but Rupert catches all"
75,00:05:24.50,00:05:24.50,the fish because he's a big man who can handle those tides.
76,00:05:26.77,00:05:26.77,"At 120 pounds, those tides would literally crush me against the"
77,00:05:30.40,00:05:30.40,He comes up and only brings one fish up to cook for himself.
78,00:05:35.33,00:05:35.33,"It was like a slap in the face. Like next time when I'm hungry,"
79,00:05:38.40,00:05:38.40,"I'll cook only enough plantains for me, because I'm doing that"
80,00:05:40.90,00:05:40.90,"job. So, I wanted to tell him that I"
81,00:05:43.80,00:05:43.80,thought that was a bad move. >> Everybody can go down
82,00:05:46.63,00:05:46.63,there and gut a fish and put it on the fire.
83,00:05:48.40,00:05:48.40,>> Yes. You go out there and spend that
84,00:05:50.43,00:05:50.43,hour and a half fishing. We can't physically do that.
85,00:05:53.17,00:05:53.17,If we... >> How many fish have you
86,00:05:55.67,00:05:55.67,cleaned? >> I've cleaned one.
87,00:05:57.53,00:05:57.53,>> How many have they cleaned? None.
88,00:05:59.47,00:05:59.47,>> But you're talking to someone who does help out.
89,00:06:01.57,00:06:01.57,I'm just saying we're doing the other things that...
90,00:06:04.00,00:06:04.00,>> But don't be mad at me because I'm starving and come
91,00:06:06.00,00:06:06.00,"back and put a fish on the fire. >> No, but my thing"
92,00:06:08.07,00:06:08.07,"is all of us, Rupert. I know you're bigger."
93,00:06:10.30,00:06:10.30,We all have the same hunger pangs.
94,00:06:12.43,00:06:12.43,>> Everybody could have gotten up and cleaned their own
95,00:06:14.07,00:06:14.07,damn fish. >> I was cooking.
96,00:06:15.93,00:06:15.93,>> And everybody else? What was everybody else doing?
97,00:06:18.70,00:06:18.70,>> I know. I'm not talking for everyone
98,00:06:20.90,00:06:20.90,else. >> My little Jenna had
99,00:06:23.37,00:06:23.37,the nerve to bitch at me about putting one of my fish on the
100,00:06:27.40,00:06:27.40,grill. She's just getting really a pain
101,00:06:30.20,00:06:30.20,"in the ass, and I'm very sorry that I have an alliance with"
102,00:06:33.90,00:06:33.90,her. Jenna just got mad at me for
103,00:06:36.13,00:06:36.13,throwing the fish on there and saying that I was eating in
104,00:06:39.07,00:06:39.07,front of you guys. >> You know what?
105,00:06:40.43,00:06:40.43,You eat that fish. Nobody is complaining.
106,00:06:43.23,00:06:43.23,You can eat all those fishes. You don't have to share with us
107,00:06:46.17,00:06:46.17,at all. I think that the dynamics are
108,00:06:48.53,00:06:48.53,"changing a lot in this tribe, and I wouldn't count me out yet"
109,00:06:52.87,00:06:52.87,"because she-devil has some tricks up her sleeves, and I'll"
110,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,be playing them. >> PROBST: Have a seat on the
111,00:07:06.73,00:07:06.73,bench. All right.
112,00:07:12.83,00:07:12.83,Today's challenge is for reward. And we thought this time maybe
113,00:07:16.87,00:07:16.87,we'll show you what the reward is before we tell you about the
114,00:07:20.03,00:07:20.03,"challenge. Amber, here's your mom, Sheryl."
115,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,"Come on in, Sheryl! >> Oh, my God."
116,00:07:29.83,00:07:29.83,">> PROBST: Amber, get on that mat."
117,00:07:39.97,00:07:39.97,">> Oh, my God. Oh, my God."

121,00:08:01.00,00:08:01.00,"You grew a beard, too. Losing weight."
122,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,">> You too, huh? >> Yeah, on the South"

126,00:08:34.47,00:08:34.47,I'm sorry. >> Don't be sorry.
127,00:08:38.13,00:08:38.13,">> This is my mom, Lily."
128,00:08:39.67,00:08:39.67,">> PROBST: How does she look, Mom?"

195,00:12:48.20,00:12:48.20,"Bo's good. Laura, Lily and Mike."
196,00:12:52.97,00:12:52.97,Laura is good. It's between Mike and Laura.

207,00:13:25.80,00:13:25.80,Don't smell it. >> PROBST: Fish that's been
208,00:13:28.30,00:13:28.30,marinating in seawater in the sun for three days.
209,00:13:32.03,00:13:32.03,"Boston Rob remembers it well, and to make it fun we'll do just"
210,00:13:34.87,00:13:34.87,"like we did in the Marquesas, hands behind your back."
211,00:13:38.70,00:13:38.70,Here we go. Three will move on.
212,00:13:40.97,00:13:40.97,"Three, two, one, eat. >> Swallow it down, Mike."
213,00:13:46.73,00:13:46.73,Just swallow the whole thing whole.
214,00:13:48.40,00:13:48.40,>> PROBST: Bo's face says it all.

218,00:13:59.40,00:13:59.40,He's got it down. I can smell that burp.
219,00:14:01.47,00:14:01.47,Ji's in. We're looking for one more.
220,00:14:03.43,00:14:03.43,"It's Laura or Mike. >> Come on, Mike."

228,00:14:36.30,00:14:36.30,tarantulas. We featured these in Thailand.

230,00:14:44.23,00:14:44.23,you will move on. Make sure you show me that mouth
231,00:14:47.07,00:14:47.07,and make sure it's empty. Hands on the table.

242,00:15:18.13,00:15:18.13,"but I clearly said, ""Show me an empty mouth."
243,00:15:20.77,00:15:20.77,"Once I clear you, if it comes ""up, you're okay, and then you"
244,00:15:24.30,00:15:24.30,"can take a drink of water."" I know you don't like the"

250,00:15:46.13,00:15:46.13,me. You ready to do this?
251,00:15:48.77,00:15:48.77,"Three, two, one, eat. Bo shoves the whole thing in his"
252,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,"mouth, it's down and he's in! >> Who's your daddy now?"
253,00:15:56.03,00:15:56.03,>> Whoa! >> Wow!

257,00:16:07.93,00:16:07.93,might as well go after it. >> PROBST: I like that attitude.
258,00:16:10.30,00:16:10.30,"Mike? >> Yes, sir."
259,00:16:13.10,00:16:13.10,>> PROBST: great effort. It was nice having you out here.

267,00:16:36.53,00:16:36.53,deal. We've taken Camp Chapera where
268,00:16:40.40,00:16:40.40,"you used to live and we've upgraded it a little bit,"
269,00:16:43.00,00:16:43.00,Probably like you wish it had been when you lived there.
270,00:16:45.80,00:16:45.80,"You're going to spend the night with pop, see what it's like"
271,00:16:48.80,00:16:48.80,"being a survivor, and hey, if it's good for two, it's"
272,00:16:51.47,00:16:51.47,"better for four, right? So Big Tom, choose one survivor,"
273,00:16:55.37,00:16:55.37,"we'll bring their loved one back, and the four of you will"
274,00:16:59.10,00:16:59.10,spend the night at Chapera. >> Rupert.
275,00:17:03.90,00:17:03.90,Rupert with Laura. >> I'm gonna pick aggravation
276,00:17:10.97,00:17:10.97,right there. >> PROBST: Boston Rob.
277,00:17:13.53,00:17:13.53,"Mike, get on back here. You're not done yet."
278,00:17:18.20,00:17:18.20,"Boy, it is going to be a party tonight with the four of you."
279,00:17:21.33,00:17:21.33,>> Yeah! >> Whoo!
280,00:17:46.37,00:17:46.37,">> Home again, home again! >> Home sweet home."
281,00:17:50.57,00:17:50.57,">> Wow, look at the food. >> That's the best thing"
282,00:17:55.33,00:17:55.33,I've tasted in the last 31 days. >> Here's to friends and
283,00:17:57.77,00:17:57.77,family. >> To friends and family.
284,00:18:00.17,00:18:00.17,">> Ooh, baby. It's good to drink beer with my"
285,00:18:03.23,00:18:03.23,I wished it had been his mother or my neighbor's
286,00:18:06.47,00:18:06.47,sister... after I seen what a romantic
287,00:18:12.00,00:18:12.00,"And I could have picked old Rupert, but I couldn't have"
288,00:18:14.67,00:18:14.67,stand to see him. I've never seen a man slobber
289,00:18:17.53,00:18:17.53,over a woman like he did his wife.
290,00:18:19.67,00:18:19.67,There was slobber hanging down in his beard.
291,00:18:22.43,00:18:22.43,>> What do you think about everybody back at camp?
292,00:18:25.00,00:18:25.00,>> Me? >> Yeah.
293,00:18:26.87,00:18:26.87,What do you think they're doing right about now?
294,00:18:29.50,00:18:29.50,>> Amber's getting high on life or getting low on the ground.
295,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,Rupert's probably kissing and hunting his harpoon.
296,00:18:37.87,00:18:37.87,Jenna is running that mouth like a bell clapper and Shii Ann is
297,00:18:41.40,00:18:41.40,trying to make an alliance with a bush because she's tried
298,00:18:44.80,00:18:44.80,everybody else. ( all chuckle )
299,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,">> That's all we've got left. >> Man, you both on that swing?"
300,00:19:00.87,00:19:00.87,"Swing away, swing away. >> One, two, three."
301,00:19:04.00,00:19:04.00,">> Oh! \xe2\x99\xaa Swing low, sweet chariot"
302,00:19:13.30,00:19:13.30,Coming to carry me home. \xe2\x99\xaa ( drunken yelling )
303,00:19:20.17,00:19:20.17,>> BOTH: Who's your daddy? >> We tore it up.
304,00:19:24.13,00:19:24.13,We partied hard all night long. This is definitely what I needed
305,00:19:28.33,00:19:28.33,"to get to the end, just to finish my game, you know, a"
306,00:19:32.07,00:19:32.07,little visit from home. >> Let's go for a walk on the
307,00:19:35.27,00:19:35.27,"beach and we'll give you guys some time, all right?"
308,00:19:37.80,00:19:37.80,>> All right. >> To be completely
309,00:19:49.90,00:19:49.90,"honest with you, right now I'm in an alliance with Amber first"
310,00:19:53.33,00:19:53.33,and foremost. >> What I got to do now is
311,00:19:56.63,00:19:56.63,I got to get Rob and Amber to keep me with them.
312,00:20:00.03,00:20:00.03,">> I was, like, ""Lex, do me a favor, keep the girl and"
313,00:20:02.13,00:20:02.13,"I'll help you out on the reverse side."""
314,00:20:03.50,00:20:03.50,"He goes, ""All right."" Sweet. And the dumbass actually kept"
315,00:20:06.50,00:20:06.50,her and then I snaked him. >> I think me and Rob might
316,00:20:15.13,00:20:15.13,be first and second. That's all we said we was gonna
317,00:20:17.17,00:20:17.17,do. >> You know who my solid is?
318,00:20:19.37,00:20:19.37,It's Amber. >> Don't freakin' bank on it.
319,00:20:22.37,00:20:22.37,">> I'm banked on it. Dude, I'm telling you,"
320,00:20:24.37,00:20:24.37,"she won't switch. I'm guaranteeing, Mike."
321,00:20:26.90,00:20:26.90,I guarantee. I feel it that she's not gonna.
322,00:20:29.93,00:20:29.93,"Big Tom, though... >> You've got to do what you got"
323,00:20:32.77,00:20:32.77,to do. >> I don't trust him as
324,00:20:34.97,00:20:34.97,far as I can throw him. >> Welcome home.
325,00:20:59.83,00:20:59.83,>> Don't even tell us how it was.
326,00:21:02.07,00:21:02.07,"Did you eat pizza, Rob? How you doing?"
327,00:21:04.70,00:21:04.70,">> Okay, how you doing? >> Today, Bo and Mike"
328,00:21:09.77,00:21:09.77,came back from their little adventure with Big Tom and Rob.
329,00:21:13.67,00:21:13.67,We need wood! We need wood.
330,00:21:16.53,00:21:16.53,"Let's get 'em to... As soon as they came in, instead"
331,00:21:20.43,00:21:20.43,"of letting them sit down and rest and enjoy their visit here,"
332,00:21:23.87,00:21:23.87,"we put them to work, got them started, you know, helping us"
333,00:21:26.97,00:21:26.97,out at camp. >> That boy has been on the
334,00:21:30.00,00:21:30.00,"farm all his life. When he gets up in the morning,"
335,00:21:32.73,00:21:32.73,he knows what work is. He's used to it.
336,00:21:35.27,00:21:35.27,">> On the other hand, Rob and his brother wouldn't help us"
337,00:21:38.87,00:21:38.87,get the wood. >> They didn't get
338,00:21:41.13,00:21:41.13,diddley-squat. >> Just take a nice cozy
339,00:21:43.33,00:21:43.33,seat here. >> Go spear yourself a fish.
340,00:21:45.73,00:21:45.73,>> You feeling pretty good? >> Yeah.
341,00:21:47.53,00:21:47.53,>> This will probably be the only time you'll be in
342,00:21:49.70,00:21:49.70,"the ocean. >> Is the tide deep, or...?"
343,00:21:51.47,00:21:51.47,>> It's not bad. I took Bo out spearfishing.
344,00:21:53.90,00:21:53.90,"Big Tom wanted him to spearfish badly, and I wasn't even going"
345,00:21:56.63,00:21:56.63,to give Bo a spear. >> Okay.
346,00:22:00.57,00:22:00.57,">> He won't kill you, Rupert. >> You know, I kind of"
347,00:22:04.03,00:22:04.03,"protect those spears, even though I don't talk about it."
348,00:22:06.57,00:22:06.57,"I protect those spears. This is hard fishing, you know."
349,00:22:15.93,00:22:15.93,Bo wasn't the greatest swimmer. He was using the spear to propel
350,00:22:19.50,00:22:19.50,"himself more than to fish. As we were fishing, I look at"
351,00:22:26.40,00:22:26.40,"Bo's spear, and the head of it is gone."
352,00:22:29.63,00:22:29.63,I had my flashbacks to when Sean lost his spear tip in Pearl
353,00:22:31.93,00:22:31.93,Island. >> A fine bunch of seamen.
354,00:22:35.97,00:22:35.97,What did he do? >> Lose the spear.
355,00:22:38.07,00:22:38.07,">> Oh, my God, no. >> I'm not as worried"
356,00:22:44.27,00:22:44.27,about it because I've got my spear that is now going to be
357,00:22:47.53,00:22:47.53,"considered mine. They want to keep eating, they"
358,00:22:50.37,00:22:50.37,will let me use the damn spear. >> What happened?
359,00:22:53.33,00:22:53.33,>> I did it. >> You did it?
360,00:22:56.17,00:22:56.17,Bo is a bigger dumbass than his dad.
361,00:22:58.83,00:22:58.83,"I mean, Big Tom is pretty dumb, but Bo is just-- he's out there,"
362,00:23:02.77,00:23:02.77,"too. All right. You  guys, you got to"
363,00:23:06.23,00:23:06.23,"police your zone and go... >> See you soon, all right?"
364,00:23:11.20,00:23:11.20,>> It's kind of like a dream to come down here and see my
365,00:23:14.30,00:23:14.30,"brother. And remember, trust no one."
366,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,>> All right. >> I think my brother
367,00:23:19.20,00:23:19.20,"definitely knows what he's doing, but you know,"
368,00:23:21.20,00:23:21.20,"he only has seven days to go I believe, so you're going to"
369,00:23:24.07,00:23:24.07,see a lot of sneaky activity going on.
370,00:23:26.90,00:23:26.90,"Have fun. >> All right, buddy."
371,00:23:29.13,00:23:29.13,"Tell everybody I'm all set, all right?"

373,00:23:36.80,00:23:36.80,"on you and you need to do some things and my old man, he'll"
374,00:23:39.33,00:23:39.33,"fight to the end, as long as he's walking, he'll fight so I"
375,00:23:42.23,00:23:42.23,ain't got to worry about him. >> Who's your mama?
376,00:24:11.57,00:24:11.57,Berry picking bucket. >> Berries.
377,00:24:19.10,00:24:19.10,>> Got a big-time challenge.
378,00:24:20.67,00:24:20.67,">> ""If you think this next challenge is buckets of"
379,00:24:22.53,00:24:22.53,"fun, you'll build your own fire, then go for a run."

381,00:24:29.30,00:24:29.30,"for the vote for someone else's good-bye."""
382,00:24:32.47,00:24:32.47,">> Wow. Well, we got some tree mail."
383,00:24:34.83,00:24:34.83,It's got a bucket with a hole in it and a letter basically saying
384,00:24:37.70,00:24:37.70,that it's going to be buckets of fun.
385,00:24:42.20,00:24:42.20,I know I'm still a huge target and I know if I don't win
386,00:24:45.63,00:24:45.63,"immunity, I may be the next to go."
387,00:25:02.97,00:25:02.97,>> PROBST: All right. Let's get to today's immunity
388,00:25:05.30,00:25:05.30,"challenge. Shii Ann, give it up."
389,00:25:07.83,00:25:07.83,>> I hate to part with it. >> PROBST: I know you do.
390,00:25:10.60,00:25:10.60,"Once again, immunity back up for grabs."
391,00:25:13.83,00:25:13.83,Today's immunity challenge is going to test your ability to
392,00:25:16.73,00:25:16.73,make fire quickly and keep it going.
393,00:25:19.40,00:25:19.40,Here's how it works. You'll have two buckets.
394,00:25:21.87,00:25:21.87,One bucket you will use to build fire.
395,00:25:24.07,00:25:24.07,The second bucket you will fill with water.
396,00:25:26.33,00:25:26.33,"As you fill that second bucket, the weight of the water will"
397,00:25:29.10,00:25:29.10,cause that bucket to drop. That will cause the fire bucket
398,00:25:32.37,00:25:32.37,to lift. Your goal: get that fire bucket
399,00:25:34.87,00:25:34.87,high enough to light a fuse which will ignite the wok at the
400,00:25:37.47,00:25:37.47,top of your structure. The first person to get their
401,00:25:39.97,00:25:39.97,fire to light the fuse wins immunity.
402,00:25:42.80,00:25:42.80,Here's the rub. The bucket that you're putting
403,00:25:45.00,00:25:45.00,"water in has a hole in it, so you're going to have to keep an"
404,00:25:48.83,00:25:48.83,"eye on your fire, making sure you don't run out of matches"
405,00:25:52.43,00:25:52.43,while you chase down more water. Make sense?
406,00:25:54.63,00:25:54.63,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: we'll draw numbers"
407,00:25:56.47,00:25:56.47,for your positions and we'll get started.
408,00:26:02.37,00:26:02.37,"For immunity, survivors ready? Go!"
409,00:26:10.97,00:26:10.97,Mariano takes his entire pile. So does Amber.
410,00:26:17.20,00:26:17.20,>> First step is getting that fire going.
411,00:26:28.43,00:26:28.43,Rupert's already has got fire. Shii Ann taking her time.
412,00:26:41.07,00:26:41.07,Rupert has fire and he's going for water.
413,00:26:44.20,00:26:44.20,Big Tom has fire. Big Tom going for the water.
414,00:26:50.67,00:26:50.67,Rupert and Big Tom filling up their water buckets.
415,00:26:54.43,00:26:54.43,"Mariano has fire. Boston Rob, Rupert and Big Tom"
416,00:27:00.83,00:27:00.83,filling their water buckets. Jenna has fire.
417,00:27:07.40,00:27:07.40,"Shii Ann with a good fire going, building something that's going"
418,00:27:09.73,00:27:09.73,to last. Amber still trying to get her
419,00:27:11.73,00:27:11.73,fire going. Boston Rob's bucket is moving.
420,00:27:20.77,00:27:20.77,This may do it. His fire bucket is up.
421,00:27:29.10,00:27:29.10,It doesn't look like the fire is going to be strong enough.
422,00:27:35.97,00:27:35.97,"Don't touch it, let it fall. Work that fire."
423,00:27:40.73,00:27:40.73,Boston Rob's fire went out. He had enough water but he had
424,00:27:43.87,00:27:43.87,no flame once it went up. That's why you guys got to keep
425,00:27:47.13,00:27:47.13,"an eye on your fire, make sure your fire is still going or"
426,00:27:50.33,00:27:50.33,you're wasting your time. All the water's drained out of
427,00:27:53.67,00:27:53.67,Big Tom's bucket. Shii Ann's fire has gone out.
428,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,Everybody is starting over. We're dead even once again.
429,00:28:01.10,00:28:01.10,"Got to tend to your fire, build a fire that's going to last."
430,00:28:06.13,00:28:06.13,Boston Rob is down to his last match.
431,00:28:09.97,00:28:09.97,Make sure you light something that's going to stay lit.
432,00:28:13.33,00:28:13.33,"Wind playing a factor, got to protect that flame."
433,00:28:29.07,00:28:29.07,>> I'm out. >> PROBST: Boston Rob is out of
434,00:28:31.57,00:28:31.57,"matches and has no fire, out of the competition."
435,00:28:36.10,00:28:36.10,"Boy, even with matches you guys are having a tough time getting"
436,00:28:39.17,00:28:39.17,fire. >> I'm out.
437,00:28:46.10,00:28:46.10,>> PROBST: Amber is out of matches.
438,00:28:47.93,00:28:47.93,Boston Rob and Amber out of the competition.
439,00:28:55.07,00:28:55.07,"You out of matches, Rupert? >> Yep."
440,00:28:58.10,00:28:58.10,>> PROBST: Rupert's out of matches.
441,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,Rupert out of the competition. Big Tom has another flame.
442,00:29:03.50,00:29:03.50,"Can he keep this one going? >> That's it, I'm out."
443,00:29:07.73,00:29:07.73,>> PROBST: Jenna is out of matches.
444,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50,Down to Big Tom and Shii Ann and Big Tom has a fire going.
445,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,>> I'm out of patience. >> Where are the fire
446,00:29:15.57,00:29:15.57,"gods when you need them? >> PROBST: Tom, really doing a"
447,00:29:19.33,00:29:19.33,good job with the fire right now.
448,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,Patience is paying off. >> Go get that water.
449,00:29:24.10,00:29:24.10,>> PROBST: Shii Ann getting close.
450,00:29:31.43,00:29:31.43,>> Nice. >> PROBST: Each time you get a
451,00:29:33.37,00:29:33.37,"little closer, Big Tom. >> Come on, Tom."
452,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40,You got it. >> PROBST: Shii Ann has fire.
453,00:29:40.17,00:29:40.17,">> Go, go, go. >> PROBST: Shii Ann's fire"
454,00:29:43.37,00:29:43.37,"getting stronger. >> Tom, a little momentum, not"
455,00:29:45.87,00:29:45.87,quite enough. This could be enough.
456,00:29:48.07,00:29:48.07,"This one might do it. Question is, is his fire going"
457,00:29:50.63,00:29:50.63,"to be strong enough? Close, close, close, just shy."
458,00:30:04.17,00:30:04.17,That's it. Big Tom!
459,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,"Wins immunity. >> Way to go, Tom."
460,00:30:12.57,00:30:12.57,Very good. >> PROBST: Came down to two and
461,00:30:15.73,00:30:15.73,nobody gave up. Big Tom pulled it out.
462,00:30:18.57,00:30:18.57,"Turn around here, buddy. Put this on."
463,00:30:22.90,00:30:22.90,">> Thank you, man. >> PROBST: You got it?"
464,00:30:25.73,00:30:25.73,>> My first... >> PROBST: Nice job.
465,00:30:28.47,00:30:28.47,You are safe tonight at Tribal Council.
466,00:30:30.87,00:30:30.87,"The other five of you, not as secure."
467,00:30:33.13,00:30:33.13,Somebody going home tonight. You have the afternoon to think
468,00:30:35.03,00:30:35.03,about who that's going to be. We'll see you all at Tribal
469,00:30:36.87,00:30:36.87,Council. Go back to camp.
470,00:30:52.83,00:30:52.83,>> \xe2\x99\xaa I'm going to surprise everybody.
471,00:30:55.07,00:30:55.07,\xe2\x99\xaa Here I come. Here comes Big Tom.
472,00:30:56.67,00:30:56.67,\xe2\x99\xaa Here he comes. I worried myself to death.
473,00:31:01.23,00:31:01.23,\xe2\x99\xaa I guess like everybody I've worried myself to death...
474,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,I won immunity. I finally got one.
475,00:31:07.10,00:31:07.10,I was proud of it. See ya later.
476,00:31:09.53,00:31:09.53,>> I find the dynamics in the tribe very interesting at
477,00:31:12.00,00:31:12.00,"this point, because now it's down to six and if anybody wants"
478,00:31:14.50,00:31:14.50,"to take a power position, they're going to have to use me"
479,00:31:17.13,00:31:17.13,"as a swing vote. I mean, if you went to Rob and"
480,00:31:20.87,00:31:20.87,"talked to him about voting for Jenna instead of me, maybe, but"
481,00:31:24.43,00:31:24.43,that's pretty risky. You need to talk to Amber.
482,00:31:27.03,00:31:27.03,">> Well, I've said all along, tonight I'd rather have"
483,00:31:28.90,00:31:28.90,Jenna go. I told you that.
484,00:31:31.67,00:31:31.67,">> Well, here's the thing. What I don't understand is, if"
485,00:31:33.50,00:31:33.50,"you want Jenna gone, why don't you just go talk to Amber?"
486,00:31:36.87,00:31:36.87,>> You're putting me like I'm a damn hero here.
487,00:31:38.87,00:31:38.87,I can't do nothing. I'm like you.
488,00:31:41.17,00:31:41.17,"Why don't you vote her off? Me and you, we've got two votes."
489,00:31:43.77,00:31:43.77,>> Yeah. I'll vote her off.
490,00:31:45.77,00:31:45.77,">> All right, well, there's two. Now what are we going to do?"
491,00:31:48.70,00:31:48.70,The only way she can save herself is to get three other
492,00:31:51.63,00:31:51.63,"people to vote off... Well, I'd like to vote Jenna"
493,00:31:54.03,00:31:54.03,off. I'd want Jenna gone because Rob
494,00:31:56.80,00:31:56.80,"and Amber pulls Jenna in, my butt is on a highway to hell."
495,00:32:01.37,00:32:01.37,">> Big Tom wants Jenna out. >> Yeah, he hates Jenna."
496,00:32:05.13,00:32:05.13,>> He hates Jenna. >> I don't care who goes
497,00:32:06.93,00:32:06.93,as long as it's not me. >> I'm not going to
498,00:32:09.37,00:32:09.37,leave without trying. >> If you can get them
499,00:32:12.67,00:32:12.67,"to vote Jenna off, it would be beautiful."
500,00:32:14.70,00:32:14.70,>> I'm feeling out a few people. I'm trying to see if there's any
501,00:32:17.80,00:32:17.80,way I can get a tentative alliance.
502,00:32:20.57,00:32:20.57,"I mean, each one of them is planning to take a knife out and"
503,00:32:23.17,00:32:23.17,"stab the other in the back. So, I'll tell you who Big Tom"
504,00:32:27.47,00:32:27.47,"wants to vote out, and you tell..."
505,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,>> Rupert. >> No.
506,00:32:30.37,00:32:30.37,>> Jenna. If you would be willing to do
507,00:32:32.40,00:32:32.40,that. >> He told me that he was
508,00:32:34.53,00:32:34.53,annoyed with her. >> He hates her.
509,00:32:36.07,00:32:36.07,">> But unless he voted with me, I can't do it."
510,00:32:38.37,00:32:38.37,>> But would you do it? >> Shii Ann is talking
511,00:32:40.50,00:32:40.50,about getting out Jenna. I don't know necessarily if I'm
512,00:32:43.13,00:32:43.13,"gonna, you know, 100% go along with it, but I'm gonna entertain"
513,00:32:45.70,00:32:45.70,"the idea, because this is the All-Star."
514,00:32:48.10,00:32:48.10,"It's, uh, hard-core. You've got to play this game, I"
515,00:32:50.97,00:32:50.97,"think, more intense than you did before."
516,00:32:52.80,00:32:52.80,>> This looks like fun time for girl talk.
517,00:32:54.77,00:32:54.77,>> We're just talking about the stuff I'm gonna eat.
518,00:32:58.33,00:32:58.33,">> What are you gonna eat, Shii Ann?"
519,00:33:00.27,00:33:00.27,">> Oh, my God, so much. >> Shii Ann's a scrambler."
520,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,"I can't even deal with her. I'm very, very annoyed with her."
521,00:33:06.07,00:33:06.07,"Let's put it that way. She opens her mouth, and I feel"
522,00:33:09.10,00:33:09.10,"like putting a gun in mine. >> No, but the only thing is,"
523,00:33:18.07,00:33:18.07,I made a deal. >> I realize you've got to go
524,00:33:20.87,00:33:20.87,"all the way, and if you can't  go all the way, you've got to go"
525,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,all the way fighting. And that is how I'm choosing to
526,00:33:26.80,00:33:26.80,play the game. I can't wait to see what's gonna
527,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,happen. I mean...
528,00:33:31.10,00:33:31.10,>> It's going to be interesting. >> It's gonna be real
529,00:33:34.37,00:33:34.37,"interesting, because, you know, I know a lot of things about"
530,00:33:36.60,00:33:36.60,"this tribe, and it's all gonna come out tonight at Tribal."
531,00:33:39.17,00:33:39.17,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
532,00:34:04.23,00:34:04.23,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury...
533,00:34:06.63,00:34:06.63,"Lex, Kathy and Alicia-- voted out at the last Tribal Council."
534,00:34:17.53,00:34:17.53,"All right, guys, let's talk a little about roles."
535,00:34:20.20,00:34:20.20,"Jenna, who's working? Who isn't?"
536,00:34:22.77,00:34:22.77,">> Uh, Rupert's always working, catching fish and"
537,00:34:25.23,00:34:25.23,lugging some wood along with Big Tom.
538,00:34:28.70,00:34:28.70,"Um, I've been the only person to go get plantains."
539,00:34:32.63,00:34:32.63,">> PROBST: What's Amber doing? >> Uh, Amber helps"
540,00:34:35.23,00:34:35.23,"make the plantains. She got water, and we cook."
541,00:34:38.70,00:34:38.70,>> PROBST: How about Boston Rob? What's he doing to keep a place
542,00:34:40.93,00:34:40.93,in this tribe? >> Boston Rob has been
543,00:34:43.90,00:34:43.90,"trying to fish, but the majority of the work is definitely"
544,00:34:47.20,00:34:47.20,"Rupert and... Big Tom combined. >> PROBST: Boston Rob, do you"
545,00:34:50.87,00:34:50.87,"agree with the assessment, you're not really doing that"
546,00:34:52.67,00:34:52.67,"much? >> Uh, I don't think"
547,00:34:54.70,00:34:54.70,"that was the assessment, Jeff. >> I think I said..."
548,00:34:57.33,00:34:57.33,>> I probably haven't been as productive.
549,00:35:00.23,00:35:00.23,"I mean, I've fished almost as much as Rupert, maybe not as"
550,00:35:03.70,00:35:03.70,"much, but I've tried as much. I haven't been as productive as"
551,00:35:07.33,00:35:07.33,"getting them, but I'm out there giving it a shot."
552,00:35:10.03,00:35:10.03,">> PROBST: Amber, do you take the past 33 days and look at the"
553,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,actions of people and factor that in to who really still is
554,00:35:16.57,00:35:16.57,trustworthy? >> I'm definitely
555,00:35:18.63,00:35:18.63,factoring in the actions that people have made in the last
556,00:35:20.80,00:35:20.80,"couple of days, let alone the whole entire game."
557,00:35:23.37,00:35:23.37,People have changed a little bit since day one.
558,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27,"I know for me, paranoia around camp is... it's insane, it's"
559,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,"ridiculous, you can't escape it, and... it's gotten to the point"
560,00:35:32.63,00:35:32.63,"where I'm annoyed with it. >> PROBST: Rupert, are you"
561,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,noticing that the paranoia is causing an annoyance to the
562,00:35:38.80,00:35:38.80,point that it's starting to fracture relationships?
563,00:35:43.33,00:35:43.33,>> The paranoia in our tribe has at times started to
564,00:35:48.27,00:35:48.27,"rip our tribe apart, rip alliances apart, rip friends"
565,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"apart. >> This is funny,"
566,00:35:54.20,00:35:54.20,'cause you are the most paranoid person.
567,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,( Jenna and Rupert talking ) >> PROBST: Wait.
568,00:35:57.43,00:35:57.43,"So what happened, Rupert? >> When I brought fish"
569,00:36:00.83,00:36:00.83,"home, and I looked at everybody and said, ""I'm taking one and"
570,00:36:03.37,00:36:03.37,"putting it on the fire right now and I'm eating it, and I don't"
571,00:36:05.77,00:36:05.77,"give a damn what anybody else does,"" it kind of freaked them"
572,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,"out a little bit. >> PROBST: Well, it's a fair"
573,00:36:10.67,00:36:10.67,"question, though. If your role is to provide fish,"
574,00:36:12.97,00:36:12.97,why should you be entitled to the first one?
575,00:36:15.60,00:36:15.60,Somebody else is doing fire. Do they get to sit next...
576,00:36:17.63,00:36:17.63,closer to the fire? >> And if somebody's
577,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,"doing plantains, do they get to eat all that they want and then"
578,00:36:22.30,00:36:22.30,you cook yours later? >> That is why it
579,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,freaked everybody out-- because... I just stepped up and
580,00:36:30.07,00:36:30.07,"said, ""Mine."" >> I wasn't freaked out."
581,00:36:32.77,00:36:32.77,I thought he deserved to eat a fish before the challenge.
582,00:36:34.70,00:36:34.70,"He went and caught it. >> You know, it's so"
583,00:36:36.63,00:36:36.63,"funny, this paranoia about the food is mostly caused by one"
584,00:36:40.87,00:36:40.87,"person pointing it out, and that person would be Jenna."
585,00:36:44.57,00:36:44.57,"The person at camp who monitors food, plantains, fish, coconut,"
586,00:36:49.37,00:36:49.37,"who makes it, who tells us when we can make it, is Jenna."
587,00:36:54.17,00:36:54.17,">> PROBST: So, Shii Ann, why are you asking Jenna?"
588,00:36:56.07,00:36:56.07,">> You've never asked me. >> Jenna, stop monitoring what"
589,00:36:58.37,00:36:58.37,what everyone is eating. And if Rupert catches 20 fish
590,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,"and he wants to eat them all, let him."
591,00:37:02.93,00:37:02.93,"Rupert, you deserve every single one of those fish."
592,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,No one else here catches as many fish or does as much work as
593,00:37:08.57,00:37:08.57,Rupert. So I don't blame him for putting
594,00:37:11.57,00:37:11.57,that first fish on the fire. I don't blame him if he wants to
595,00:37:14.73,00:37:14.73,"eat all 20 fish, because, gosh darn it, he earned it."
596,00:37:17.87,00:37:17.87,"I mean, I'm just gonna call it as see it."
597,00:37:19.90,00:37:19.90,"The people who are remaining, there's two power pairs, right?"
598,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,"There's Rupert and Jenna, there's Rob and Amber, there's"
599,00:37:24.97,00:37:24.97,no secret. I keep wondering why they've
600,00:37:27.33,00:37:27.33,"decided not to take Tom and I, who are swing votes, to"
601,00:37:30.43,00:37:30.43,eliminate one of the two of the power pairs.
602,00:37:32.43,00:37:32.43,"You know, take one power couple and just cut it up."
603,00:37:35.13,00:37:35.13,>> PROBST: you got everything out?
604,00:37:36.93,00:37:36.93,">> No, uh, what should I say? No, I... See, I'm very torn"
605,00:37:40.80,00:37:40.80,tonight about who I should cast my vote for.
606,00:37:43.57,00:37:43.57,Whether or not I should cast a vote for the person who I found
607,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,"most annoying on the tribe, or... if I should cast a vote"
608,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,"for the person who I think might win this game, and point them"
609,00:37:53.97,00:37:53.97,"out. >> PROBST: When you say, by"
610,00:37:57.47,00:37:57.47,"making that vote, you'll expose them?"
611,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,">> Well, I'm not... By making that vote, I will be making a"
612,00:38:01.63,00:38:01.63,"statement. You know, I'm just going to say"
613,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,this. Tonight I'm going to be casting
614,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,my vote for the person who I think is playing the game the
615,00:38:08.77,00:38:08.77,"best, for the person who I think everyone else on the tribe"
616,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,"should be looking out for, and for the person who I think, if"
617,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"people don't watch, will win the million dollars."
618,00:38:20.73,00:38:20.73,So maybe this will help shake it up.
619,00:38:23.00,00:38:23.00,>> PROBST: Is that your goal? >> Yeah. I love the
620,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,unpredictable. I want to see what happens.
621,00:38:27.57,00:38:27.57,">> PROBST: Big Tom, you have the coveted immunity."
622,00:38:30.40,00:38:30.40,"Formally, I will ask you if you want to give it up."
623,00:38:32.73,00:38:32.73,>> I don't... That's the ignorantest thing
624,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,"that's been said here tonight. No-no offense to you, but, no, I"
625,00:38:40.33,00:38:40.33,don't want to give it up. >> PROBST: Big Tom gonna hold on
626,00:38:42.93,00:38:42.93,to immunity. You cannot vote for Big Tom.
627,00:38:45.27,00:38:45.27,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to find out what
628,00:38:47.57,00:38:47.57,exactly is going on within this tribe.
629,00:38:50.73,00:38:50.73,"Boston Rob, you're up. >> It's time for you"
630,00:39:14.20,00:39:14.20,"to go, and if you're wondering if you can eat and how much you"
631,00:39:17.00,00:39:17.00,"can, because you think that I monitor that, eat a lot, Shii"
632,00:39:19.50,00:39:19.50,"Ann, eat a lot. >> Amber, this vote is"
633,00:39:44.90,00:39:44.90,for you out of respect. You are the mastermind right
634,00:39:48.33,00:39:48.33,"now, so from one she-devil to another, this is the vote I'm"
635,00:39:52.37,00:39:52.37,casting tonight. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
636,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
637,00:40:13.67,00:40:13.67,decision is final. The person voted out will be
638,00:40:15.73,00:40:15.73,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
639,00:40:18.37,00:40:18.37,I'll read the votes. First vote...
640,00:40:23.47,00:40:23.47,Shii Ann. Shii Ann.
641,00:40:28.80,00:40:28.80,Two votes Shii Ann. Amber.
642,00:40:34.83,00:40:34.83,"Two votes Shii Ann, one vote Amber."
643,00:40:39.50,00:40:39.50,"Shii Ann. Three votes Shii Ann, one vote"
644,00:40:41.67,00:40:41.67,Amber. The 13th person voted out of the
645,00:40:47.00,00:40:47.00,tribe... Shii Ann.
646,00:40:49.57,00:40:49.57,That's enough-- you need to bring me your torch.
647,00:41:01.23,00:41:01.23,"Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken. >> Good luck, everyone."
648,00:41:06.50,00:41:06.50,>> PROBST: It's time for you to go.
649,00:41:16.50,00:41:16.50,"Well, Shii Ann went out of this game playing until the very end."
650,00:41:20.40,00:41:20.40,Obviously she wanted to stir things up a little bit in camp.
651,00:41:22.70,00:41:22.70,"Guess the next few days will show us what, if any, impact her"
652,00:41:26.47,00:41:26.47,words had. Grab your torches.

664,00:42:07.63,00:42:07.63,me we needed to get Rob off? >> The she-devil did her best.
665,00:42:15.73,00:42:15.73,I really tried. I played this game as hard as I
666,00:42:18.43,00:42:18.43,could. I played with the best of the
667,00:42:21.30,00:42:21.30,"best, but you know what? I knew I was outnumbered, and I"
668,00:42:23.70,00:42:23.70,"knew they were gonna vote me off, so I just wanted to warn"
669,00:42:27.07,00:42:27.07,"everyone, don't forget little Amber with her big green eyes"
670,00:42:30.70,00:42:30.70,"and her beautiful smile. Don't forget, she's playing for"
671,00:42:32.70,00:42:32.70,a million dollars.
