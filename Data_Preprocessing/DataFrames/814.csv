390,00:25:13.83,00:25:13.83,Today's immunity challenge isgoing to test your ability to
391,00:25:16.73,00:25:16.73,make fire quickly and keep itgoing.
392,00:25:19.40,00:25:19.40,Here's how it works.You'll have two buckets.
393,00:25:21.87,00:25:21.87,One bucket you will use to buildfire.
394,00:25:24.07,00:25:24.07,The second bucket you will fillwith water.
395,00:25:26.33,00:25:26.33,"As you fill that second bucket,the weight of the water will"
396,00:25:29.10,00:25:29.10,cause that bucket to drop.That will cause the fire bucket
397,00:25:32.37,00:25:32.37,to lift.Your goal: get that fire bucket
398,00:25:34.87,00:25:34.87,high enough to light a fusewhich will ignite the wok at the
399,00:25:37.47,00:25:37.47,top of your structure.The first person to get their
400,00:25:39.97,00:25:39.97,fire to light the fuse winsimmunity.
401,00:25:42.80,00:25:42.80,Here's the rub.The bucket that you're putting
402,00:25:45.00,00:25:45.00,"water in has a hole in it, soyou're going to have to keep an"
403,00:25:48.83,00:25:48.83,"eye on your fire, making sureyou don't run out of matches"
404,00:25:52.43,00:25:52.43,while you chase down more water.Make sense?

406,00:25:56.47,00:25:56.47,for your positions and we'll getstarted.

408,00:26:10.97,00:26:10.97,Mariano takes his entire pile.So does Amber.
409,00:26:17.20,00:26:17.20,>> First step is getting thatfire going.

418,00:27:11.73,00:27:11.73,fire going.Boston Rob's bucket is moving.
419,00:27:20.77,00:27:20.77,This may do it.His fire bucket is up.
420,00:27:29.10,00:27:29.10,It doesn't look like the fire isgoing to be strong enough.
421,00:27:35.97,00:27:35.97,"Don't touch it, let it fall.Work that fire."
422,00:27:40.73,00:27:40.73,Boston Rob's fire went out.He had enough water but he had
423,00:27:43.87,00:27:43.87,no flame once it went up.That's why you guys got to keep
424,00:27:47.13,00:27:47.13,"an eye on your fire, make sureyour fire is still going or"
425,00:27:50.33,00:27:50.33,you're wasting your time.All the water's drained out of

557,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27,"I know for me, paranoia aroundcamp is... it's insane, it's"
558,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,"ridiculous, you can't escape it,and... it's gotten to the point"
559,00:35:32.63,00:35:32.63,"where I'm annoyed with it.>> PROBST: Rupert, are you"
560,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,noticing that the paranoia iscausing an annoyance to the
561,00:35:38.80,00:35:38.80,point that it's starting tofracture relationships?
562,00:35:43.33,00:35:43.33,>> The paranoia in ourtribe has at times started to
563,00:35:48.27,00:35:48.27,"rip our tribe apart, ripalliances apart, rip friends"
564,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"apart.>> This is funny,"
565,00:35:54.20,00:35:54.20,'cause you are the most paranoidperson.
566,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,( Jenna and Rupert talking )>> PROBST: Wait.
567,00:35:57.43,00:35:57.43,"So what happened, Rupert?>> When I brought fish"
568,00:36:00.83,00:36:00.83,"home, and I looked at everybodyand said, ""I'm taking one and"
569,00:36:03.37,00:36:03.37,"putting it on the fire right nowand I'm eating it, and I don't"
570,00:36:05.77,00:36:05.77,"give a damn what anybody elsedoes,"" it kind of freaked them"
571,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,"out a little bit.>> PROBST: Well, it's a fair"
572,00:36:10.67,00:36:10.67,"question, though.If your role is to provide fish,"
573,00:36:12.97,00:36:12.97,why should you be entitled tothe first one?
574,00:36:15.60,00:36:15.60,Somebody else is doing fire.Do they get to sit next...
575,00:36:17.63,00:36:17.63,closer to the fire?>> And if somebody's
576,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,"doing plantains, do they get toeat all that they want and then"
577,00:36:22.30,00:36:22.30,you cook yours later?>> That is why it
578,00:36:25.07,00:36:25.07,freaked everybody out--because... I just stepped up and
579,00:36:30.07,00:36:30.07,"said, ""Mine."">> I wasn't freaked out."
580,00:36:32.77,00:36:32.77,I thought he deserved to eat afish before the challenge.
581,00:36:34.70,00:36:34.70,"He went and caught it.>> You know, it's so"
582,00:36:36.63,00:36:36.63,"funny, this paranoia about thefood is mostly caused by one"
583,00:36:40.87,00:36:40.87,"person pointing it out, and thatperson would be Jenna."
584,00:36:44.57,00:36:44.57,"The person at camp who monitorsfood, plantains, fish, coconut,"
585,00:36:49.37,00:36:49.37,"who makes it, who tells us whenwe can make it, is Jenna."
586,00:36:54.17,00:36:54.17,">> PROBST: So, Shii Ann, why areyou asking Jenna?"
587,00:36:56.07,00:36:56.07,">> You've never asked me.>> Jenna, stop monitoring what"
588,00:36:58.37,00:36:58.37,what everyone is eating.And if Rupert catches 20 fish
589,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,"and he wants to eat them all,let him."
590,00:37:02.93,00:37:02.93,"Rupert, you deserve every singleone of those fish."
591,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,No one else here catches as manyfish or does as much work as
592,00:37:08.57,00:37:08.57,Rupert.So I don't blame him for putting
593,00:37:11.57,00:37:11.57,that first fish on the fire.I don't blame him if he wants to
594,00:37:14.73,00:37:14.73,"eat all 20 fish, because, goshdarn it, he earned it."
595,00:37:17.87,00:37:17.87,"I mean, I'm just gonna call itas see it."
596,00:37:19.90,00:37:19.90,"The people who are remaining,there's two power pairs, right?"
597,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,"There's Rupert and Jenna,there's Rob and Amber, there's"
598,00:37:24.97,00:37:24.97,no secret.I keep wondering why they've
599,00:37:27.33,00:37:27.33,"decided not to take Tom and I,who are swing votes, to"
600,00:37:30.43,00:37:30.43,eliminate one of the two of thepower pairs.
601,00:37:32.43,00:37:32.43,"You know, take one power coupleand just cut it up."
602,00:37:35.13,00:37:35.13,>> PROBST: you got everythingout?
603,00:37:36.93,00:37:36.93,">> No, uh, what should I say?No, I... See, I'm very torn"
604,00:37:40.80,00:37:40.80,tonight about who I should castmy vote for.
605,00:37:43.57,00:37:43.57,Whether or not I should cast avote for the person who I found
606,00:37:47.33,00:37:47.33,"most annoying on the tribe,or... if I should cast a vote"
607,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,"for the person who I think mightwin this game, and point them"
608,00:37:53.97,00:37:53.97,"out.>> PROBST: When you say, by"
609,00:37:57.47,00:37:57.47,"making that vote, you'll exposethem?"
610,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,">> Well, I'm not... By makingthat vote, I will be making a"
611,00:38:01.63,00:38:01.63,"statement.You know, I'm just going to say"
612,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,this.Tonight I'm going to be casting
613,00:38:05.63,00:38:05.63,my vote for the person who Ithink is playing the game the
614,00:38:08.77,00:38:08.77,"best, for the person who I thinkeveryone else on the tribe"
615,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,"should be looking out for, andfor the person who I think, if"
616,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"people don't watch, will win themillion dollars."
617,00:38:20.73,00:38:20.73,So maybe this will help shake itup.
618,00:38:23.00,00:38:23.00,>> PROBST: Is that your goal?>> Yeah. I love the
619,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,unpredictable.I want to see what happens.
620,00:38:27.57,00:38:27.57,">> PROBST: Big Tom, you have thecoveted immunity."
621,00:38:30.40,00:38:30.40,"Formally, I will ask you if youwant to give it up."
622,00:38:32.73,00:38:32.73,>> I don't...That's the ignorantest thing
623,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,"that's been said here tonight.No-no offense to you, but, no, I"
624,00:38:40.33,00:38:40.33,don't want to give it up.>> PROBST: Big Tom gonna hold on
625,00:38:42.93,00:38:42.93,to immunity.You cannot vote for Big Tom.
626,00:38:45.27,00:38:45.27,Everybody else is fair game.It is time to find out what
627,00:38:47.57,00:38:47.57,exactly is going on within thistribe.
628,00:38:50.73,00:38:50.73,"Boston Rob, you're up.>> It's time for you"
629,00:39:14.20,00:39:14.20,"to go, and if you're wonderingif you can eat and how much you"
630,00:39:17.00,00:39:17.00,"can, because you think that Imonitor that, eat a lot, Shii"
631,00:39:19.50,00:39:19.50,"Ann, eat a lot.>> Amber, this vote is"

636,00:40:13.67,00:40:13.67,decision is final.The person voted out will be
637,00:40:15.73,00:40:15.73,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
638,00:40:18.37,00:40:18.37,I'll read the votes.First vote...
639,00:40:23.47,00:40:23.47,Shii Ann.Shii Ann.

646,00:41:01.23,00:41:01.23,"Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken.>> Good luck, everyone."
647,00:41:06.50,00:41:06.50,>> PROBST: It's time for you togo.
648,00:41:16.50,00:41:16.50,"Well, Shii Ann went out of thisgame playing until the very end."
649,00:41:20.40,00:41:20.40,Obviously she wanted to stirthings up a little bit in camp.
650,00:41:22.70,00:41:22.70,"Guess the next few days willshow us what, if any, impact her"
