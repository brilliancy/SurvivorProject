452,00:26:04.90,00:26:04.90,"of probably ten minutes,we all sort of spread out and"

546,00:30:57.20,00:30:57.20,Why don't we just builda shelter that's in the...
547,00:30:59.37,00:30:59.37,the middle of a ring of fire?And then no crabs can get to us.
548,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,>> My mistake not liftingthe shelter off the ground.

615,00:34:21.57,00:34:21.57,any clothes in the village.We didn't think it was necessary
616,00:34:23.47,00:34:23.47,"at the time.>> Hey, girlie."
617,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,">> Out of all the thingsthat could happen,"

624,00:34:46.30,00:34:46.30,where nice wet denim rubsfor a day and a half
625,00:34:49.53,00:34:49.53,and just starts eatingthat skin away.
626,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,>> I do not want to wearmy sneakers today.
627,00:34:55.43,00:34:55.43,"I want them to just dryfor once, just once."

631,00:35:04.50,00:35:04.50,few pieces of clothing.I can cut that seam right there
632,00:35:07.53,00:35:07.53,and make it a top and tie it.>> That could be a really
633,00:35:10.47,00:35:10.47,"good top for you, actually.>> I can't tell you"
634,00:35:12.20,00:35:12.20,how much better this feels.This wet thing has been
635,00:35:14.33,00:35:14.33,draping on me for days now.>> I can walk in these.
636,00:35:19.53,00:35:19.53,>> Finally making some shorts.>> Want me to cut it?
637,00:35:22.10,00:35:22.10,">> I'm wearing a nice Armanisuit, but I had no choice--"

642,00:35:34.40,00:35:34.40,pants for the night.>> We can get two skirts
643,00:35:36.43,00:35:36.43,"out of this, and the bottom partwill be big enough for you."
644,00:35:38.97,00:35:38.97,>> Okay.Definitely.
645,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,"My dress was falling apart,so we decided to go ahead"

663,00:36:45.07,00:36:45.07,They say we'll go later for thewater.
664,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,Personally...we need to do it now.
665,00:36:53.73,00:36:53.73,"Water well...Oh, shut up."
666,00:36:57.57,00:36:57.57,Water well!>> There's a water well
667,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,thing right on the map.>> We were looking everywhere
668,00:37:03.87,00:37:03.87,"for the water source,not thinking, ""Oh, let's look at"
669,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,"the map.""Water well is on our map."
670,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47,>> Oh!>> Oh!
671,00:37:09.97,00:37:09.97,>> Oh!>> Nicely done.

674,00:37:18.27,00:37:18.27,needing water for so long.This is our boat.
675,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,">> It's a trail.>> So, it's back here."
676,00:37:23.20,00:37:23.20,>> So... So we should justfollow that trail on back there.
677,00:37:25.80,00:37:25.80,">> Yeah, let's go get water.>> Why didn't we check the map"
678,00:37:30.63,00:37:30.63,earlier?That's what makes me angry.
679,00:37:32.37,00:37:32.37,">> Well, we were so busy witheverything."
680,00:37:34.03,00:37:34.03,>> I know.We need to kick ass
681,00:37:36.53,00:37:36.53,on that shelter.Here's one of these bad boys.
682,00:37:41.57,00:37:41.57,">> Actually yesterday, we builta half A-frame up against a"
683,00:37:43.67,00:37:43.67,"shale wall.It's actually pretty funny,"
684,00:37:45.60,00:37:45.60,because I thinkthe shale wall was the home
685,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,"to about 300 hermit crabs,which paid us a visit"
686,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"in the middle of the night.So, I thought we should"
687,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,"probably move our shelter,so we're doing a little"
688,00:37:54.10,00:37:54.10,penthouse suite here.It's actually going
689,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,to have a floor.We don't want to be
690,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,"on the floor anymore,so... where the crabs can get"
691,00:37:59.00,00:37:59.00,us.>> One of the biggest things in
692,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,my troop is we tuck our shirtsin.
693,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"We look like a Scout,we act like a Scout."
694,00:38:05.73,00:38:05.73,>> Yeah.>> And here I'm running around
695,00:38:07.57,00:38:07.57,with my blouse open...>> You know...

700,00:38:18.17,00:38:18.17,probably her best friendat the moment.
701,00:38:19.60,00:38:19.60,She kind of looks at the othergirls as trying to be cute
702,00:38:21.73,00:38:21.73,"and pretty and stuff.And, uh, an-and me,"
703,00:38:23.73,00:38:23.73,me and her go offand have a good time

714,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,>> I'm a very active person.I don't like to sit around
715,00:39:07.53,00:39:07.53,"doing absolutely nothing,and we had this spear gun,"
716,00:39:10.57,00:39:10.57,"and I looked around, I was like,""Hey, guys, I think"
717,00:39:12.43,00:39:12.43,"I'm gonna go out."">> Have you used it before?"
718,00:39:14.50,00:39:14.50,">> Oh, yeah.Shawn went with me, and we went"

730,00:39:58.40,00:39:58.40,"to catch food, but I knewthat one fish just wasn't"
731,00:40:00.87,00:40:00.87,"going to be enough,so I took the spear."
732,00:40:10.23,00:40:10.23,"So, I start catching fish.Oh, I got lunch!"
