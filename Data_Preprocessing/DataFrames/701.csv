2,00:00:17.20,00:00:17.20,"the Rembrandt van Rijn, heading south off the coast of"
3,00:00:20.43,00:00:20.43,Panama to a remote location in the Pacific waters
4,00:00:23.10,00:00:23.10,"of Central America. Down below, 16 Americans"
5,00:00:26.53,00:00:26.53,who have no idea the adventure of a lifetime has already begun.
6,00:00:30.73,00:00:30.73,"After traveling all night, they arrived Panama City"
7,00:00:33.23,00:00:33.23,"early this morning, boarded this vessel,"
8,00:00:36.20,00:00:36.20,"suitcases still in tow, still wearing the same clothes"
9,00:00:38.87,00:00:38.87,"they had on on the plane. Right now, they're relaxing"
10,00:00:41.20,00:00:41.20,under the false assumption that we are several days away
11,00:00:45.03,00:00:45.03,from starting the game. They think we're heading out
12,00:00:47.77,00:00:47.77,"to take publicity photos. What they don't know,"
13,00:00:50.10,00:00:50.10,"this game has already started, and it is full of surprises."
14,00:00:54.07,00:00:54.07,"For instance, those suitcases, so carefully packed with"
15,00:00:57.53,00:00:57.53,essential outdoor clothing-- worthless.
16,00:01:00.60,00:01:00.60,The only clothes they're going to be taking
17,00:01:02.87,00:01:02.87,are the clothes on their back. And more twists await.
18,00:01:06.13,00:01:06.13,Their destination-- the Pearl Islands--
19,00:01:08.20,00:01:08.20,a land with a bloody history of looting and piracy.
20,00:01:11.43,00:01:11.43,Brutal battles took place in these waters as pirates preyed
21,00:01:14.83,00:01:14.83,"on unsuspecting ships, plundering their gold, silver"
22,00:01:17.23,00:01:17.23,and pearls. ( pirates shouting )
23,00:01:20.50,00:01:20.50,"The jungles, which were the perfect hideout for these"
24,00:01:23.20,00:01:23.20,"pirates, are rugged. The weather, temperamental."
25,00:01:26.90,00:01:26.90,"The waters here are home to some of the most magnificent,"
26,00:01:29.50,00:01:29.50,"but deadly, marine life anywhere in the Pacific Ocean."
27,00:01:32.87,00:01:32.87,"Sharks, stingrays, eels, even whales thrive in a"
28,00:01:37.67,00:01:37.67,spectacular world beneath the sea.
29,00:01:40.10,00:01:40.10,This will be their home for the next 39 days.
30,00:01:43.33,00:01:43.33,"They must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted out"
31,00:01:46.10,00:01:46.10,"of the tribe. In the end, only one will"
32,00:01:48.43,00:01:48.43,remain to claim the million- dollar prize.
33,00:01:57.93,00:01:57.93,"39 days, 16 people... one survivor."

37,00:03:48.13,00:03:48.13,We're starting right now. I know everybody here brought
38,00:03:51.17,00:03:51.17,"their suitcases, I know you got a lot more"
39,00:03:53.23,00:03:53.23,"luggage downstairs. And it's true, in the past,"
40,00:03:56.10,00:03:56.10,survivors have been allowed to go through their luggage
41,00:04:00.23,00:04:00.23,and pick out a few essential items.
42,00:04:03.90,00:04:03.90,You guys won't have that luxury. ( nervous giggling )
43,00:04:08.03,00:04:08.03,You're going into this game with the clothes you have
44,00:04:11.37,00:04:11.37,on your back... just like if you really
45,00:04:15.50,00:04:15.50,"were shipwrecked. >> He says, ""The game starts,"
46,00:04:18.90,00:04:18.90,"you're taking nothing."" I was like, ""Oh..."""
47,00:04:23.27,00:04:23.27,">> Looking at the wardrobe, I got to say, a couple of nice"
48,00:04:26.27,00:04:26.27,suits up here. ( laughing )
49,00:04:27.97,00:04:27.97,>> I'm wearing an Armani suit. How am I going to get by?
50,00:04:31.83,00:04:31.83,What am I going to do with a suit?
51,00:04:33.30,00:04:33.30,>> PROBST: A very cute strapless dress-- I hope you're wearing
52,00:04:36.50,00:04:36.50,something under that. ( laughter )
53,00:04:38.63,00:04:38.63,">> I was like, ""Okay, well, this is fine."
54,00:04:40.70,00:04:40.70,"""You know, I don't have a bra on; I hope my dress stays up."""
55,00:04:42.57,00:04:42.57,>> PROBST: I'm sure the Boy Scouts of America will be glad
56,00:04:44.60,00:04:44.60, to see they're represented. ( laughing )
57,00:04:47.20,00:04:47.20,"When it comes to your footwear, however, I took the liberty"
58,00:04:49.90,00:04:49.90,of going through your suitcases. Here are your tennis shoes.
59,00:04:53.97,00:04:53.97,I want you to have a fighting chance at the challenges.
60,00:04:56.93,00:04:56.93,"Okay. Now, I need to get"
61,00:04:59.20,00:04:59.20,your personal items. I want everything.
62,00:05:01.33,00:05:01.33,"Start getting it out-- watches, wallets, money, passports"
63,00:05:05.03,00:05:05.03,and any jewelry you don't want to lose...
64,00:05:07.93,00:05:07.93,"I want in here. Bags are staying behind,"
65,00:05:12.57,00:05:12.57,"so you don't need to go through your bags,"
66,00:05:13.80,00:05:13.80,just anything else. ( laughter )
67,00:05:18.50,00:05:18.50,"You were really hoping, weren't you?"
68,00:05:20.53,00:05:20.53,">> I was hoping. Hey, there's a snowball's chance"
69,00:05:22.67,00:05:22.67,in hell that I thought you guys would let me bring this.
70,00:05:25.20,00:05:25.20,">> PROBST: Put it in there. Okay, your tribe names--"
71,00:05:28.97,00:05:28.97,going to be based on two of the most notorious
72,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,"pirates in Panamanian history-- the Drake Tribe, after Sir"
73,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,"Francis Drake, and the Morgan Tribe, after Henry Morgan."
74,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,"So, as I call out your name, you'll come forward,"
75,00:05:42.47,00:05:42.47,we'll divide into tribes. First up: Shawn... wearing blue.
76,00:05:49.53,00:05:49.53,First member of the Drake Tribe. Have a spot right over here.
77,00:05:52.97,00:05:52.97,Darrah... wearing orange.

81,00:06:05.40,00:06:05.40,"Osten, come on up. Look at that loot."
82,00:06:11.83,00:06:11.83,( laughter ) That is pirate-like.
83,00:06:14.70,00:06:14.70,"You got booze, music. >> That's booty."
84,00:06:17.27,00:06:17.27,">> PROBST: Rupert, next member of the Drake Tribe."

86,00:06:23.87,00:06:23.87,">> Rupert is the man. I thought, ""This dude is cool."
87,00:06:27.63,00:06:27.63,"""He's a big old hippie, and, uh, he looks strong as an"
88,00:06:30.47,00:06:30.47,"ox."" >> PROBST: Next member"

97,00:07:05.80,00:07:05.80,">> Tijuana, she's unbelievable. She's a Nubian princess."
98,00:07:10.43,00:07:10.43,That's how good-looking she is. >> PROBST: Next member of the

105,00:07:38.27,00:07:38.27,"I don't play fair. What's up, big boys?!"
106,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,Let me hear it! >> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe's
107,00:07:43.50,00:07:43.50,about to be very happy. Here's the woman
108,00:07:45.47,00:07:45.47,who's wearing nothing under her dress--
109,00:07:46.97,00:07:46.97,"come on down, Nicole. >> Found a new use for this"
110,00:07:50.83,00:07:50.83,thing. >> PROBST: You're right.
111,00:07:51.97,00:07:51.97,"Works as a great tube top. Personal items, please."
112,00:07:54.60,00:07:54.60,And you're over there. Give me those personal items.
113,00:07:59.03,00:07:59.03,Last member of the Drake Tribe: Sandra.
114,00:08:03.23,00:08:03.23,( clapping ) Last member of the Morgan Tribe:

116,00:08:12.47,00:08:12.47,"expensive suit. >> Thanks, man."
117,00:08:16.20,00:08:16.20,">> PROBST: Now, if you thought the clothing issue was tough,"
118,00:08:19.77,00:08:19.77,"it's about to get worse, because when you arrive"
119,00:08:21.63,00:08:21.63,"at your camp, there's nothing waiting for you there, either."
120,00:08:24.80,00:08:24.80,"Nothing-- no food whatsoever, not the first bit of tools,"
121,00:08:29.27,00:08:29.27,no flint and steel to start fire.
122,00:08:32.10,00:08:32.10,"I mean zip. What I can offer you, though,"
123,00:08:35.70,00:08:35.70,is this-- the opportunity to control
124,00:08:38.17,00:08:38.17,your own fate. 100 Balboas in here--
125,00:08:43.77,00:08:43.77,that's Panamanian money. Behind me... small fishing
126,00:08:47.60,00:08:47.60,"village. You're in luck, it's market day."
127,00:08:50.50,00:08:50.50,"I'm not going to lie to you. It's a small village,"
128,00:08:52.87,00:08:52.87,"there's not a lot there, but if you're smart"
129,00:08:54.73,00:08:54.73,"and you have a plan, you can get everything"
130,00:08:56.87,00:08:56.87,you need-- the essentials to help you survive 39 days.
131,00:09:00.60,00:09:00.60,Explore this village. There's a lot of nooks and
132,00:09:03.10,00:09:03.10,"crannies, knock on doors. When you run out of money,"
133,00:09:05.07,00:09:05.07,"barter with what you have, which is, granted,"
134,00:09:07.07,00:09:07.07,"not much, but use it. You're not coming back here."
135,00:09:12.37,00:09:12.37,Map to your new home. You must set aside enough money
136,00:09:16.27,00:09:16.27,to hire a boat and a driver to get you to your camps.
137,00:09:20.90,00:09:20.90,"You each will have your own island, and they are a long"
138,00:09:23.73,00:09:23.73,ways away. You need to be there by sundown.
139,00:09:26.47,00:09:26.47,Got a lot to accomplish in the next few hours.
140,00:09:30.13,00:09:30.13,You're going to have to work together
141,00:09:31.53,00:09:31.53,as a tribe to pull it off. I wish you the very best of
142,00:09:35.17,00:09:35.17,"luck. >> I was like, ""Oh, my God."
143,00:09:37.63,00:09:37.63,"What have I done?"" This is beyond what"
144,00:09:39.27,00:09:39.27,I bargained for. I knew it was going to be
145,00:09:41.77,00:09:41.77,the adventure of a lifetime. I didn't know it was going to be
146,00:09:44.33,00:09:44.33,this big of an adventure of a lifetime.
147,00:09:45.90,00:09:45.90,">> PROBST: Drake, there's a life ring."
148,00:09:47.07,00:09:47.07,"Morgan, there's a life ring. If you needed a reason"
149,00:09:49.27,00:09:49.27,"to get in, here it is! There go the shoes."
150,00:09:52.13,00:09:52.13,"Go, guys! ( all clamoring )"
151,00:09:57.50,00:09:57.50,>> PROBST: Life ring. Somebody better get
152,00:09:59.57,00:09:59.57,"your life ring, or you're never gonna make it in."
153,00:10:01.40,00:10:01.40,Better not dilly-dally. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
154,00:10:38.00,00:10:38.00,>> I don't get in the water. I respect the water.
155,00:10:40.17,00:10:40.17,"( laughs ) Unless I absolutely have to,"
156,00:10:42.20,00:10:42.20,"and I had to. And I'm not, like, that"
157,00:10:44.80,00:10:44.80,"strong of a swimmer, so I was in a state of shock."
158,00:10:49.00,00:10:49.00,"I was like, ""Oh, my Lord. I could be in some..."
159,00:10:51.07,00:10:51.07,"a world of hurt right now."" >> Are you okay?"
160,00:11:01.00,00:11:01.00,>> I never would have thought swimming with my clothes on
161,00:11:03.23,00:11:03.23,"would have been so hard, but it was."
162,00:11:07.40,00:11:07.40,"With my big denim jeans, my legs were rubber."
163,00:11:11.03,00:11:11.03,It took all I had to keep kicking and getting it to shore.
164,00:11:16.00,00:11:16.00,"I was spent, and it hadn't even started yet."
165,00:11:31.37,00:11:31.37,"( chuckles ) >> The girls, they're... they're"
166,00:11:38.57,00:11:38.57,"running off, so... >> Okay."
167,00:11:39.40,00:11:39.40,>> ...so we have to carry the... >> I'll carry their crap.
168,00:11:41.33,00:11:41.33,>> All right. >> We didn't come to shore
169,00:11:42.87,00:11:42.87,together at all. I was hoping that we would
170,00:11:45.40,00:11:45.40,"come together with some plans and some goals, uh,"
171,00:11:48.10,00:11:48.10,"what we wanted to go to first, but that wasn't the case at all."
172,00:11:51.43,00:11:51.43,"Uh, some of the girls took off. >> Do you know where we can"
173,00:11:55.10,00:11:55.10,"get a boat? >> And, uh, Ryno, he-he just"
174,00:11:58.27,00:11:58.27,took off. He was gone-- it's like he
175,00:12:00.17,00:12:00.17,wasn't even part of the tribe. He was gone and he had his own
176,00:12:02.50,00:12:02.50,mission. I don't even remember him
177,00:12:04.33,00:12:04.33,consulting anybody about it. >> Fire?
178,00:12:06.30,00:12:06.30,"Flint? >> No, no, no."
179,00:12:08.37,00:12:08.37,">> No? >> Uh, boat?"
180,00:12:10.23,00:12:10.23,">> Boat? Yes, yes. >> Okay."
181,00:12:13.83,00:12:13.83,I wanted to check out the village and get to certain
182,00:12:16.70,00:12:16.70,places and find where stuff was first and also try to find
183,00:12:21.30,00:12:21.30,where the boat was. And I run all the way down
184,00:12:24.17,00:12:24.17,"to the boat dock, and I didn't have a map."
185,00:12:26.37,00:12:26.37,I didn't have any money to pay this guy.
186,00:12:28.30,00:12:28.30,What's the most to go pretty much anywhere?
187,00:12:30.40,00:12:30.40,I forgot my map. >> Nadie habla ingles.
188,00:12:37.63,00:12:37.63,>> Screwed up this one. ( indistinct voices )
189,00:12:47.13,00:12:47.13,">> All right, someone sit on it for a minute."
190,00:12:50.03,00:12:50.03,">> Well, here, here's our group. >> All right."
191,00:12:52.27,00:12:52.27,"Stay here with this, Rupert. You watch it."
192,00:12:53.83,00:12:53.83,Let's get the money. Where's the money?
193,00:12:55.37,00:12:55.37,"We need it. >> When I got to those stairs,"
194,00:12:59.37,00:12:59.37,"I was done. We sit the sucker down,"
195,00:13:02.47,00:13:02.47,"and I needed to rest. The other team, Morgan,"
196,00:13:09.43,00:13:09.43,"came up, sat their stuff down next to us, and all left."
197,00:13:15.10,00:13:15.10,This is definitely a pirate adventure.
198,00:13:18.23,00:13:18.23,"Pirates pillage, pirates steal, pirates take advantage."
199,00:13:24.90,00:13:24.90,If they were gonna be silly enough to put it
200,00:13:26.97,00:13:26.97,"right next to me, I'm gonna put it in my thing."
201,00:13:29.13,00:13:29.13,"All their trade goods, all the little"
202,00:13:31.07,00:13:31.07,"women's shoes, the insoles. Everything that I could find"
203,00:13:34.30,00:13:34.30,"in theirs, I took. I've always said I will lie,"
204,00:13:37.93,00:13:37.93,cheat and steal to win this game.
205,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,We're going on. There was my stealing.
206,00:13:43.03,00:13:43.03,"I stole for the Drake. Take them, take them."
207,00:13:46.20,00:13:46.20,"You know, get anything. >> Whose are these?"
208,00:13:48.53,00:13:48.53,>> Pirated. >> Oh.
209,00:13:50.20,00:13:50.20,>> Feel that. Feel that. Feel that.
210,00:13:51.60,00:13:51.60,For a knife? For a knife? For a pineapple?
211,00:13:58.87,00:13:58.87,Shoes... >> \xc2\xbfCambiarlo por eso?
212,00:14:01.30,00:14:01.30,>> Pineapple? Yeah? We are pirates... so we pirated.
213,00:14:07.30,00:14:07.30,"Yeah, it's a hard life, living the pirate's life."
214,00:14:18.77,00:14:18.77,>> We got water. >> We got water?
215,00:14:20.93,00:14:20.93,"Okay, we need, um... >> Machete?"
216,00:14:22.90,00:14:22.90,">> We got, we got, we got knives, we got knives."
217,00:14:24.53,00:14:24.53,>> We need flint steel? >> How 'bout food?
218,00:14:25.70,00:14:25.70,>> Yeah. >> Yeah. Fishing stuff.
219,00:14:26.83,00:14:26.83,"Where's the fishing stuff? Hold on, let me ask this lady."
220,00:14:29.73,00:14:29.73,The way we attacked getting our supplies at the village
221,00:14:32.03,00:14:32.03,"was, uh, a bit chaotic. It was confusion."
222,00:14:36.33,00:14:36.33,>> Rice? Rice? >> Rice.
223,00:14:39.47,00:14:39.47,">> Hey, Ryan, how many candles? >> You want to buy a belt?"
224,00:14:42.63,00:14:42.63,By chance? Buy a belt.
225,00:14:43.90,00:14:43.90,"Stand up real quick, come on. Stand up, come here."
226,00:14:46.10,00:14:46.10,"We only had a limited amount of money, so I made an"
227,00:14:48.93,00:14:48.93,impulsive decision to sell my clothes to benefit my tribe.
228,00:14:52.33,00:14:52.33,Slide them right in there. Look at that.
229,00:14:54.17,00:14:54.17,That's unbelievable. That looks... that looks great.
230,00:14:57.43,00:14:57.43,"How, how... I sell it to you?"
231,00:14:59.03,00:14:59.03,"Dos Balboas. Thank you, partner."
232,00:15:01.17,00:15:01.17,"I appreciate it. You know, you got"
233,00:15:03.67,00:15:03.67,to fast-talk some people. And I was willing to try
234,00:15:05.63,00:15:05.63,to do whatever it took to-to make the sale
235,00:15:07.53,00:15:07.53,so that we could have more money for my group
236,00:15:09.80,00:15:09.80,to do whatever we needed to do with the money.
237,00:15:11.87,00:15:11.87,">> Let me, uh, let me talk... Can I talk to two girls real"
238,00:15:13.53,00:15:13.53,quick? >> Mm-hmm.
239,00:15:14.37,00:15:14.37,>> Just a little strategy. Come here.
240,00:15:17.60,00:15:17.60,">> I'm listening, too. >> Okay, come on."
241,00:15:19.57,00:15:19.57,"( speaking indistinctly ) But you know old, old men"
242,00:15:22.53,00:15:22.53,"are real horny. So, maybe sometimes if we don't"
243,00:15:24.63,00:15:24.63,"have money, flash your boobs-- give 'em a quick peek or"
244,00:15:26.80,00:15:26.80,"something like that, all right? I don't mean to be rude,"
245,00:15:28.97,00:15:28.97,"but that-that could help. >> Osten goes, ""You know, girls,"
246,00:15:31.53,00:15:31.53,"""we don't necessarily have to spend our money."
247,00:15:33.20,00:15:33.20,"""With these old guys. ""they're really horny,"
248,00:15:34.67,00:15:34.67,"so you can just show them your boobs."""
249,00:15:36.00,00:15:36.00,"He didn't even know our names, really yet, or-or us at all."
250,00:15:38.67,00:15:38.67,"That was his first, you know, introduction to us."
251,00:15:40.63,00:15:40.63,"So I was just, like, ""This guy's a jerk."""
252,00:15:42.13,00:15:42.13,( cheering ) ( speaking Spanish )
253,00:15:55.67,00:15:55.67,">> Hey, guys. Wanna buy...?"
254,00:15:57.43,00:15:57.43,>> Dos Balboas. ( speaking Spanish )
255,00:16:04.53,00:16:04.53,">> Okay, let's go. We'll come back."
256,00:16:06.77,00:16:06.77,">> Yeah. >> He wants three and three,"
257,00:16:08.87,00:16:08.87,but the guy told us two up there.
258,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,"We buy the rice from him. >> Sandra, she was so amazing"
259,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,"in the town, because she spoke the language and worked out all"
260,00:16:16.90,00:16:16.90,these incredible deals. And we would...
261,00:16:18.40,00:16:18.40,it wouldn't have been possible. ( speaking Spanish )
262,00:16:23.63,00:16:23.63,>> Hola! >> Hola!
263,00:16:27.47,00:16:27.47,">> When we got to the village, I was lucky that I knew Spanish."
264,00:16:30.27,00:16:30.27,And I was trying to bargain with the lady at the store
265,00:16:32.87,00:16:32.87,and ask people for certain things.
266,00:16:34.83,00:16:34.83,>> What's the cheapest lantern? And do they...?
267,00:16:38.73,00:16:38.73,( Sandra speaking Spanish ) >> Por favor.
268,00:16:52.50,00:16:52.50,"She'll do it for your eyes. >> Oh, gracias!"
269,00:16:55.73,00:16:55.73,>> Your eyes for her... >> Gracias! Oh!
270,00:16:59.80,00:16:59.80,>> The lady at the store had it in for Trisha.
271,00:17:02.07,00:17:02.07,Trisha thought the lady was laughing and giggling
272,00:17:04.03,00:17:04.03,"with her or whatever. But the lady actually, I think,"
273,00:17:06.63,00:17:06.63,"you know, liked her in a sexual way."
274,00:17:13.50,00:17:13.50,"There's, uh, Trisha hugging the lady, laughing and giggling"
275,00:17:16.40,00:17:16.40,"like it's all good. And I'm like, ""Yo, we need to"
276,00:17:19.37,00:17:19.37,"go."" You got to stay with her."
277,00:17:20.90,00:17:20.90,We're gonna leave you here for a few minutes.
278,00:17:22.80,00:17:22.80,>> I feel that the village people really respected Sandra
279,00:17:24.93,00:17:24.93,because she was being nice and decent about things
280,00:17:27.43,00:17:27.43,"and respectful, unlike the other tribe"
281,00:17:29.87,00:17:29.87,that was screaming at people. >> Give me my money back.
282,00:17:32.80,00:17:32.80,Money. I need my money back.
283,00:17:34.80,00:17:34.80,I don't want it. Money.
284,00:17:37.80,00:17:37.80,"Okay, if y'all gonna steal from me,"
285,00:17:39.20,00:17:39.20,"I'm gonna steal from y'all. >> Yeah, this is the one"
286,00:17:41.57,00:17:41.57,"we paid for. >> Gracias, gracias."
287,00:17:42.77,00:17:42.77,">> We, we... we gave the money. We... No, no..."
288,00:17:45.03,00:17:45.03,">> Gracias. >> No, no, no, no, no, no."
289,00:17:47.73,00:17:47.73,>> Then don't do this! Don't do this!
290,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,">> No, no, no, no, no. >> Where's the money at?"
291,00:17:51.00,00:17:51.00,">> Where's our money? >> No, no."
292,00:17:52.67,00:17:52.67,>> S\xc3\xad! >> Muy poquito.
293,00:17:55.53,00:17:55.53,">> We're walking out with the merchandise we paid for,"
294,00:17:57.63,00:17:57.63,"then another person says, ""No, you didn't pay for it""?!"
295,00:17:59.77,00:17:59.77,"Wait, what? I-I'm sorry?"
296,00:18:02.10,00:18:02.10,"So, it definitely was a difficult situation,"
297,00:18:04.00,00:18:04.00,especially when you don't know all of the words
298,00:18:06.10,00:18:06.10,that you need to say. No!
299,00:18:07.33,00:18:07.33,">> No, no, no. >> Where's the money?"
300,00:18:08.53,00:18:08.53,">> Hey, hey, she, she just told you she gave you the money."
301,00:18:10.97,00:18:10.97,">> No, no, no. >> S\xc3\xad! You're stealing."
302,00:18:15.17,00:18:15.17,>> I don't really get along with Tijuana.
303,00:18:17.03,00:18:17.03,"She seemed, like, extremely overexcited about certain"
304,00:18:20.77,00:18:20.77,"things, and that was just frustrating for me."
305,00:18:22.97,00:18:22.97,">> Where's the money? Okay, where's the money?"
306,00:18:24.43,00:18:24.43,( overlapping shouts ) >> We handled it to the best
307,00:18:28.57,00:18:28.57,"of our ability. And in the end, they came out"
308,00:18:30.60,00:18:30.60,"on top by saying, ""Basically, we'll give this to you."""
309,00:18:32.93,00:18:32.93,">> Okay, God will bless you. >> So it worked out well."
310,00:18:37.03,00:18:37.03,"( singing and clapping ) >> We went around the corner,"
311,00:18:48.90,00:18:48.90,and there was this lady having... they were dancing.
312,00:18:51.33,00:18:51.33,"She was having a barbecue, and I says, ""You know,"
313,00:18:53.87,00:18:53.87,"I'll give you this gold chain for everything you have here."""
314,00:18:56.67,00:18:56.67,"And she looked at my chain, she was like, ""Yeah."""
315,00:18:58.90,00:18:58.90,"I put the chain around her neck, and she was like,"
316,00:19:01.23,00:19:01.23,"""What do you want?"" I said, ""I want all your"
317,00:19:03.10,00:19:03.10,"chicken, I want your aluminum foil."
318,00:19:05.27,00:19:05.27,"I want your ketchup, your hot sauce, the barbecue sauce."""
319,00:19:08.40,00:19:08.40,"She had a cutting board, a knife."
320,00:19:11.03,00:19:11.03,Everything. The only thing we didn't take
321,00:19:12.97,00:19:12.97,"was the grill. >> Yo, Blackbeard!"
322,00:19:14.87,00:19:14.87,">> Oh, you won't believe... >> She just traded her necklace."
323,00:19:18.20,00:19:18.20,">> For my gold chain. >> For her gold chain,"
324,00:19:19.70,00:19:19.70,we have... >> I got knives...
325,00:19:20.80,00:19:20.80,">> Oh, my God! >> Ketchup, hot sauce..."
326,00:19:23.90,00:19:23.90,>> I was definitely pissed to see the Drake Tribe and all
327,00:19:27.07,00:19:27.07,"of the wealth that they'd come into, all of the fortune."
328,00:19:29.50,00:19:29.50,"That definitely just kind of deflates you a little bit,"
329,00:19:32.73,00:19:32.73,"like, ""Man, we could have done that."""
330,00:19:34.07,00:19:34.07,We could have been even more prepared.
331,00:19:35.50,00:19:35.50,"They were taking their time, and we weren't."
332,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,"Okay, we got to get down there."
333,00:19:38.67,00:19:38.67,Let's get all our group-- it's a long walk.
334,00:19:40.30,00:19:40.30,Come on. You need help carrying
335,00:19:41.37,00:19:41.37,or you good? >> I got it.
336,00:19:42.83,00:19:42.83,>> Let's rock. >> Where we going?
337,00:19:43.90,00:19:43.90,"We got tons of money. >> All right. Hey, Osten!"
338,00:19:45.57,00:19:45.57,We got tons of money! >> We got money.
339,00:19:48.40,00:19:48.40,>> We had money left over. Are we going to the boat now?
340,00:19:50.43,00:19:50.43,Can we go get more-more fruit? We have more money.
341,00:19:52.73,00:19:52.73,We should have spent absolutely all of the money.
342,00:19:55.07,00:19:55.07,"I don't think we, uh, fundamentally did-did"
343,00:19:57.40,00:19:57.40,"the right, right decision. I think, I think we could have"
344,00:19:59.93,00:19:59.93,gotten a few more good supplies. I think people
345,00:20:02.20,00:20:02.20,were just too anxious to get on the boat and get-get
346,00:20:05.20,00:20:05.20,"the thing started. >> You said 35, so..."
347,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,">> Treinta y cinco. >> Okay, thank you."
348,00:20:08.77,00:20:08.77,"Thank you. Okay, we're loading right now."
349,00:20:11.50,00:20:11.50,"As far as getting enough of what we need, only time will tell."
350,00:20:31.13,00:20:31.13,"( snorting ) >> Let's see, we have rice,"
351,00:20:36.50,00:20:36.50,"we have beans, we have a container for the rice."
352,00:20:38.60,00:20:38.60,>> We got coconuts. We got another chicken.
353,00:20:40.33,00:20:40.33,">> You know, I don't know what more we need, really."
354,00:20:42.23,00:20:42.23,>> We did very well in the village.
355,00:20:44.73,00:20:44.73,"You know, we, we managed to get a ton of stuff"
356,00:20:46.83,00:20:46.83,for the little bit of money we had.
357,00:20:52.63,00:20:52.63,">> We got fishing line, a bunch of hooks."
358,00:20:54.63,00:20:54.63,"I know we got a fishing spear, uh, for catching fish."
359,00:20:58.73,00:20:58.73,"Um, we got wine, we got a-a huge tarp,"
360,00:21:02.83,00:21:02.83,"we got two machetes, which are essential."
361,00:21:04.97,00:21:04.97,>> We did good. We did good. >> We got so much.
362,00:21:06.60,00:21:06.60,"I can't believe how much we got. >> I put about $40 in my pocket,"
363,00:21:10.13,00:21:10.13,"so it wouldn't be in the bag, just as a safety measure."
364,00:21:13.00,00:21:13.00,"'Cause I figured, with that, I can definitely get a ride."
365,00:21:15.33,00:21:15.33,Treinta y cinco is a deal. Treinta y...
366,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,>> Okay. >> Yeah?
367,00:21:19.60,00:21:19.60,"All right. Let's go, guys."
368,00:21:21.37,00:21:21.37,Get the chicken! Get the chicken!
369,00:21:22.80,00:21:22.80,"Oh, you... Get the chicken!"
370,00:21:24.53,00:21:24.53,Stop the chicken! Stop the chicken!
371,00:21:32.10,00:21:32.10,( Rupert laughing ) We're pretty well fit
372,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,for the jungle right now. I think we're...
373,00:21:44.40,00:21:44.40,we're definitely ready to go all-out for the next 40 days.
374,00:22:06.27,00:22:06.27,">> Seeing the flag, I'm thinking, ""I can't believe I'm"
375,00:22:09.00,00:22:09.00,here. This is the coolest thing
376,00:22:10.63,00:22:10.63,"that's ever happened to me in my entire life."""
377,00:22:12.13,00:22:12.13,"I think that should be the first big celebration,"
378,00:22:14.33,00:22:14.33,the sheer excitement. There was none of that.
379,00:22:26.97,00:22:26.97,What do you guys think? >> Want to get everybody here so
380,00:22:29.13,00:22:29.13,we can say what we're going to do.
381,00:22:31.13,00:22:31.13,">> I got off the boat last. I walked up, and already"
382,00:22:33.33,00:22:33.33,"people were talking about, ""Where do we want to put camp?"""
383,00:22:35.73,00:22:35.73,"Blah, blah, blah. I was, like, ""Man, we're here!"
384,00:22:41.33,00:22:41.33,"""Let's jump up and down. Let's give some hugs."
385,00:22:43.63,00:22:43.63,"Let's do something."" There's none of that."
386,00:22:45.67,00:22:45.67,">> Someone get down there, we'll scout out the area."
387,00:22:47.70,00:22:47.70,">> You know, we... >> Get the fire going."
388,00:22:49.63,00:22:49.63,"And the heavier people can, uh, can move the stuff,"
389,00:22:52.03,00:22:52.03,move the cargo. I was in game mode.
390,00:22:54.23,00:22:54.23,"I wanted to get it done. The words ""Sunrise is going"
391,00:22:56.87,00:22:56.87,"down quickly"" came in my head. I knew that we needed"
392,00:23:00.20,00:23:00.20,to act fast. I'd say we have
393,00:23:01.97,00:23:01.97,"more room down there, but if you guys want to all,"
394,00:23:03.67,00:23:03.67,"as a group, go run down there? You want to go walk out real"
395,00:23:05.83,00:23:05.83,"quick, so we can just get the fire done like that?"
396,00:23:07.50,00:23:07.50,>> Yeah. >> Let's go running.
397,00:23:08.47,00:23:08.47,We don't have a lot of time. Whoo!
398,00:23:16.27,00:23:16.27,">> Osten was running up and down, looking for the perfect"
399,00:23:18.93,00:23:18.93,spot to put the camp. Osten's a big dude.
400,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,"I mean, he's got, like, muscles out to yay,"
401,00:23:23.67,00:23:23.67,"and, uh, I've been noticing them the whole time."
402,00:23:27.27,00:23:27.27,"Because he-he lets you know he has muscles,"
403,00:23:29.47,00:23:29.47,"lets you know, ""Hey, I am strong."""
404,00:23:31.80,00:23:31.80,"I'm like, okay. >> We can cut a couple of these"
405,00:23:34.60,00:23:34.60,"branches down. These will kind of, like,"
406,00:23:36.43,00:23:36.43,protect us from the... from the rain a little bit.
407,00:23:39.47,00:23:39.47,"You want to start the fire, and I'll start bringing stuff"
408,00:23:42.07,00:23:42.07,over here? >> Okay.
409,00:23:45.97,00:23:45.97,">> Lillian in her scout uniform was interesting, to say the"
410,00:23:48.30,00:23:48.30,least. I was completely thrown off-
411,00:23:50.60,00:23:50.60,kilter when I saw that. I didn't know what the hell was
412,00:23:53.63,00:23:53.63,going on or was it a joke or what was going on.
413,00:23:56.50,00:23:56.50,"I was just confused. >> Here, I'll blow on it."
414,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67,>> My troop back home would kick my butt knowing I'm using a
415,00:24:02.37,00:24:02.37,candle. It's real hard to take off
416,00:24:05.63,00:24:05.63,this scout hat. It's real hard not to be
417,00:24:08.50,00:24:08.50,"the scoutmaster here. Oh, baby."
418,00:24:11.57,00:24:11.57,">> Good job. >> Oh, baby."
419,00:24:13.37,00:24:13.37,"Team effort here, girl. >> Yeah."
420,00:24:16.37,00:24:16.37,">> If we build the shelter like this, into the rock,"
421,00:24:18.73,00:24:18.73,lean it up against the rock. You want to do that?
422,00:24:22.60,00:24:22.60,A lot less work. >> There's this big shale
423,00:24:24.80,00:24:24.80,"rock wall, and we think there's this great bamboo post"
424,00:24:27.93,00:24:27.93,"just naturally lying around, and we're like,"
425,00:24:30.93,00:24:30.93,"""This is the best."" ( grunting )"
426,00:24:38.57,00:24:38.57,">> Oh, my goodness! >> We made sure we had"
427,00:24:41.47,00:24:41.47,somewhat of a shelter. It was a... a lean-to.
428,00:24:43.90,00:24:43.90,"( laughs ) But... oh, well."
429,00:24:46.43,00:24:46.43,You can only do so much in that amount of time.
430,00:24:52.70,00:24:52.70,( cheering ) >> Whoo-hoo!
431,00:25:00.60,00:25:00.60,">> All right, guys. >> Some rice, baby."
432,00:25:03.30,00:25:03.30,>> Don't waste the food. >> It's home sweet home.
433,00:25:05.60,00:25:05.60,">> I think that's it. >> Are you all right, guys?"
434,00:25:08.83,00:25:08.83,Come on in. We're all here.
435,00:25:11.03,00:25:11.03,"We're going to have the time of our life,"
436,00:25:13.03,00:25:13.03,and at the same time we're going to kick some butt.
437,00:25:15.17,00:25:15.17,">> Yeah! >> Great, great, great."
438,00:25:19.70,00:25:19.70,">> First things first, let's get a shelter built."
439,00:25:26.13,00:25:26.13,"If we build a shelter, like, here, we can go around the tree."
440,00:25:28.80,00:25:28.80,">> This would be cool. >> Yeah, this would be, right"
441,00:25:30.67,00:25:30.67,here. We're going to build
442,00:25:31.83,00:25:31.83,something over this way. >> A shelter.
443,00:25:33.13,00:25:33.13,">> Yeah, like a little shelter. >> The shelter could go from"
444,00:25:35.47,00:25:35.47,"here to here, easily. >> Burton, as well as, um,"
445,00:25:37.57,00:25:37.57,"myself, you know, off the start, we started getting"
446,00:25:39.43,00:25:39.43,everything going. We were just a little more
447,00:25:41.73,00:25:41.73,"strong personalities, a little more physical,"
448,00:25:43.93,00:25:43.93,"you know, mentally, as well. >> So what's the priority?"
449,00:25:47.83,00:25:47.83,"Bamboo or firewood, do you think?"
450,00:25:49.07,00:25:49.07,>> Both. >> I was surprised at how
451,00:25:57.13,00:25:57.13,"quickly we all worked together. I mean, we didn't know who we"
452,00:26:02.30,00:26:02.30,"were, what your name was yet. And, um, within a matter"
453,00:26:04.90,00:26:04.90,"of probably ten minutes, we all sort of spread out and"
454,00:26:08.33,00:26:08.33,it worked out pretty well. >> One of the first items
455,00:26:11.47,00:26:11.47,on our to-do list when we got here
456,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,was build a shelter. And we did that.
457,00:26:15.40,00:26:15.40,"Actually, it looked pretty good."
458,00:26:17.30,00:26:17.30,>> Yay! >> You know what we need?
459,00:26:20.00,00:26:20.00,A little bit bigger firewood. >> Bigger firewood?
460,00:26:23.27,00:26:23.27,">> We will pretty soon. >> I was really tired,"
461,00:26:25.93,00:26:25.93,"I mean, just exhausted. It was like, ""for the love of"
462,00:26:29.73,00:26:29.73,"God."" I mean, I just wanted"
463,00:26:31.07,00:26:31.07,"to breathe for a second. I was like,"
464,00:26:32.70,00:26:32.70,"""Does anybody have water?"" >> Here we go."
465,00:26:35.97,00:26:35.97,">> Burton opened up a coconut, and he shared the coconut milk"
466,00:26:41.20,00:26:41.20,with only Shawn and Michelle. I gave Christa the look and I
467,00:26:46.17,00:26:46.17,"said, ""Did they offer you any coconut milk?"""
468,00:26:47.80,00:26:47.80,"And she was like, ""No, and I wanted some."""
469,00:26:50.53,00:26:50.53,">> Ah, refreshing. >> Over the other side,"
470,00:26:55.30,00:26:55.30,actually. Yeah. >> Shawn and Burton are a little
471,00:26:59.43,00:26:59.43,out there in their leadership. >> It's a waste to just have it
472,00:27:02.70,00:27:02.70,lying underneath like that. It's not doing anything.
473,00:27:04.93,00:27:04.93,>> Put it the other way. >> I have a better idea.
474,00:27:06.70,00:27:06.70,">> I just think they need to be a little careful of that,"
475,00:27:09.57,00:27:09.57,because they've already alienated some people.
476,00:27:11.60,00:27:11.60,">> I love when people with a beard, it's like, it"
477,00:27:13.60,00:27:13.60,catches anything that falls. ( laughter )
478,00:27:17.80,00:27:17.80,>> Shawn is being a pain in the butt.
479,00:27:19.93,00:27:19.93,"We're a strong little team, but the dynamic duo there that"
480,00:27:24.60,00:27:24.60,are posturing for the lead role need to be a little more
481,00:27:28.37,00:27:28.37,"careful, because they're going to make everybody hate them."
482,00:27:35.33,00:27:35.33,">> There's the other tree. After making the shelter,"
483,00:27:38.47,00:27:38.47,"we went to go get water. Water well, big tree."
484,00:27:43.47,00:27:43.47,"The map says, ""Go up a trail and to the right."""
485,00:27:48.17,00:27:48.17,>> There it is. >> We got water.
486,00:27:50.30,00:27:50.30,>> It's about a quarter of a mile to our water.
487,00:27:53.23,00:27:53.23,"It's not that bad. However, that's where"
488,00:27:55.13,00:27:55.13,every single mosquito on this planet lives.
489,00:27:59.47,00:27:59.47,Every one of them. Holy mosquito city.
490,00:28:02.97,00:28:02.97,>> They are having parties all over me.
491,00:28:04.77,00:28:04.77,">> We didn't get any, uh, bug oil?"
492,00:28:06.47,00:28:06.47,">> Oh, my God. I'm getting attacked."
493,00:28:08.63,00:28:08.63,>> I am getting eaten alive. Every single one of us.
494,00:28:11.60,00:28:11.60,"It's worse than I have ever, ever, ever seen."
495,00:28:14.67,00:28:14.67,"We got to get out of here. God, these bastards"
496,00:28:17.67,00:28:17.67,"are everywhere. >> Oh, you're just..."
497,00:28:21.37,00:28:21.37,">> Mine's, like, the craziest. Oh, my God, you're not too great"
498,00:28:24.73,00:28:24.73,yourself. >> We were getting torn up
499,00:28:26.80,00:28:26.80,pretty bad. I'm the least out of anyone.
500,00:28:29.77,00:28:29.77,That's it. That's all I got.
501,00:28:31.70,00:28:31.70,Shawn? (laughs)
502,00:28:33.67,00:28:33.67,"He looks like the moon, except in reverse."
503,00:28:48.97,00:28:48.97,>> There's not much water. >> We're out of water?
504,00:28:52.03,00:28:52.03,">> We've gone through it, a lot. We only brought, like, 18."
505,00:28:54.70,00:28:54.70,>> How much of that do we have left?
506,00:28:56.27,00:28:56.27,"I don't think we should be drinking any more,"
507,00:28:58.13,00:28:58.13,unless we go find some and boil some...
508,00:28:59.80,00:28:59.80,">> Yeah, I think we... >> We need to go find some."
509,00:29:01.70,00:29:01.70,>> I think water's going to be real important.
510,00:29:03.57,00:29:03.57,>> Okay. >> So what is... what is your
511,00:29:07.97,00:29:07.97,sense of water supply? What-what are your
512,00:29:09.70,00:29:09.70,instincts on this? >> I don't know.
513,00:29:11.43,00:29:11.43,"I mean I, I... I was looking for something"
514,00:29:13.30,00:29:13.30,"that, you know, followed us up into something,"
515,00:29:16.43,00:29:16.43,like animals would. >> Yeah.
516,00:29:18.70,00:29:18.70,">> We saw some running water, and, uh, looked pretty orange,"
517,00:29:23.23,00:29:23.23,it looked rusty. It was not the kind of water
518,00:29:25.83,00:29:25.83,"you'd want to drink, even if you boiled it 42 hours."
519,00:29:29.07,00:29:29.07,>> Stagnant water like that has a bunch of diseases in it.
520,00:29:31.47,00:29:31.47,">> Yeah, that's pretty... >> Looks like beer."
521,00:29:33.97,00:29:33.97,>> We meandered throughout this beach trying to guesstimate
522,00:29:38.77,00:29:38.77,"where the water may or may not be, which was just a crucial"
523,00:29:41.93,00:29:41.93,mistake. Water's essential.
524,00:29:43.40,00:29:43.40,"You need that. The... the heat, the humidity,"
525,00:29:46.23,00:29:46.23,your body's evaporating fluids constantly.
526,00:29:49.87,00:29:49.87,"They need to be replenished, or you'll dehydrate"
527,00:29:52.93,00:29:52.93,and you'll be going home. And I don't want
528,00:29:55.93,00:29:55.93,to go home right now. ( clattering )
529,00:30:10.77,00:30:10.77,>> Uh-oh. >> What was that?
530,00:30:13.10,00:30:13.10,>> Rocks and something falling. >> No.
531,00:30:15.00,00:30:15.00,>> Huh? >> No.
532,00:30:17.10,00:30:17.10,">> Yeah, it was. From up... right up here."
533,00:30:20.00,00:30:20.00,">> The rocks falling from the cliff, um, that just didn't"
534,00:30:22.50,00:30:22.50,work out at all. Because we think it's going
535,00:30:24.10,00:30:24.10,"to get worse, especially if it starts to rain."
536,00:30:29.87,00:30:29.87,>> Ow! Something bit my ass!
537,00:30:32.80,00:30:32.80,( laughing ) >> Are you serious?
538,00:30:34.40,00:30:34.40,>> I am! ( laughing )
539,00:30:38.40,00:30:38.40,>> What the hell is it? ( screaming laughter )
540,00:30:42.37,00:30:42.37,It felt like a crab! What is that?
541,00:30:44.77,00:30:44.77,"I have a feeling it was a crab. Oh, now, how am"
542,00:30:46.93,00:30:46.93,I going to sleep? As far as the little hermit
543,00:30:49.63,00:30:49.63,"crabs, we think that we're living in their home, pretty"
544,00:30:52.00,00:30:52.00,"much, because they were just crawling all over us, and they"
545,00:30:54.30,00:30:54.30,"pinch. And there were, I mean,"
546,00:30:55.23,00:30:55.23,literally dozens of them crawling through there.
547,00:30:57.20,00:30:57.20,Why don't we just build a shelter that's in the...
548,00:30:59.37,00:30:59.37,the middle of a ring of fire? And then no crabs can get to us.
549,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,>> My mistake not lifting the shelter off the ground.
550,00:31:04.60,00:31:04.60,"I'm sorry. >> Whoa, whoa."
551,00:31:08.70,00:31:08.70,We got a snake! >> Are you kidding?!
552,00:31:12.53,00:31:12.53,"( laughter ) >> That's not a snake, it's a"
553,00:31:17.43,00:31:17.43,frond. >> Osten thought there was a
554,00:31:19.47,00:31:19.47,"snake, but it was a palm frond that kept curling and moving."
555,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,And he freakin'... he's pushing people out
556,00:31:24.63,00:31:24.63,"of there, and we're laughing. >> Holy mackerel."
557,00:31:26.23,00:31:26.23,">> Oh, my God... >> I could have swore it"
558,00:31:27.87,00:31:27.87,"was, like, slithering. It kept coming down."
559,00:31:29.33,00:31:29.33,"If I see something or feel something, I"
560,00:31:31.27,00:31:31.27,"automatically go right into... freak-out mode,"
561,00:31:33.70,00:31:33.70,and I don't know why. Every time.
562,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,"It-it just never fails. I, honest to God, thought I saw"
563,00:31:39.40,00:31:39.40,"a snake. I'm not, I'm not even lying..."
564,00:31:41.10,00:31:41.10,">> I, honest to God, believe you."
565,00:31:42.30,00:31:42.30,">> It's hilarious-- we call him ""Scary Mary,"""
566,00:31:44.07,00:31:44.07,because he's never really been in a jungle environment.
567,00:31:45.87,00:31:45.87,"Any little thing... and if it touches his toe,"
568,00:31:48.43,00:31:48.43,he leaps out of the air and just shrieks.
569,00:31:51.03,00:31:51.03,( rumbling ) ( gasps )
570,00:31:52.53,00:31:52.53,>> How close was that? >> Was that a rock?
571,00:31:54.03,00:31:54.03,>> That was a rock. >> That was a rock.
572,00:31:56.27,00:31:56.27,>> Damn. >> All right.
573,00:32:07.03,00:32:07.03,"Let's do a toast. To new friends, good friends"
574,00:32:10.43,00:32:10.43,and nobody going home anytime soon.
575,00:32:12.50,00:32:12.50,>> Whoo! >> Yay!
576,00:32:14.20,00:32:14.20,( light applause ) >> I was big on getting the
577,00:32:16.37,00:32:16.37,booze yesterday. We ended up trading a pair
578,00:32:18.57,00:32:18.57,of mismatched shoes for some jugs of wine.
579,00:32:21.13,00:32:21.13,"And that was a big deal to me. Oh, good golly."
580,00:32:24.67,00:32:24.67,">> We didn't get any light, we didn't get any soap..."
581,00:32:26.87,00:32:26.87,>> But we need booze. >> We got booze.
582,00:32:28.20,00:32:28.20,>> We got booze and shelter. What else do you need?
583,00:32:30.10,00:32:30.10,">> I don't know if it's moonshine, wine, or just grain"
584,00:32:33.80,00:32:33.80,"alcohol, but we crack it open and taste it, it's the best-"
585,00:32:36.83,00:32:36.83,"tasting stuff we've ever had. That's good stuff, huh?"
586,00:32:39.03,00:32:39.03,">> Oh, God, yeah. >> That is really good."
587,00:32:40.57,00:32:40.57,">> Man, if you guys were 17, you'd so be naked."
588,00:32:42.80,00:32:42.80,>> Like at the 7-11. The wah-wah...
589,00:32:45.50,00:32:45.50,">> Jon, he reminds me of my boys who I mentor who just pop off"
590,00:32:49.43,00:32:49.43,"stupid stuff. You know, talk about getting"
591,00:32:52.27,00:32:52.27,"some honey, or... smoking something, drinking something."
592,00:32:56.57,00:32:56.57,>> Where are the teenage girls? Everyone laughs at all my jokes.
593,00:32:59.97,00:32:59.97,I knew going in that was going to be a huge bonus for me.
594,00:33:04.13,00:33:04.13,"Because I'm not very strong, and I... I don't profess to be."
595,00:33:07.83,00:33:07.83,"However, I'm a funny guy. Trish, the dish!"
596,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,"You piss her off, she be a bitch."
597,00:33:15.77,00:33:15.77,>> Jon is a goofball. You can kind of get
598,00:33:18.30,00:33:18.30,the whole group laughing and get it together.
599,00:33:20.33,00:33:20.33,"I mean, which is great, because we definitely need that"
600,00:33:22.47,00:33:22.47,"out here. But I think at times,"
601,00:33:24.30,00:33:24.30,he's a little obnoxious. Anybody want this?
602,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,">> Yeah, I... >> Yeah."
603,00:33:28.63,00:33:28.63,I'm going crazy! >> He's out of control.
604,00:33:32.77,00:33:32.77,">> ( bleep ) you, man, ( bleep ) you!"
605,00:33:35.20,00:33:35.20,>> I really can't stand him. He talks too much crap--
606,00:33:37.80,00:33:37.80,"all night long, cursing. He thinks it's cute,"
607,00:33:40.67,00:33:40.67,but it isn't. It gets old.
608,00:33:42.43,00:33:42.43,It's already old. >> Whoo!
609,00:33:44.40,00:33:44.40,A girl in Vegas ( bleep ). ( laughter )
610,00:33:46.57,00:33:46.57,Hey. >> Pass the bottle before you
611,00:33:48.70,00:33:48.70,"drop it. >> It's so sick, it was"
612,00:33:52.23,00:33:52.23,( bleep ). ( laughs )
613,00:34:09.60,00:34:09.60,>> I don't think this is ever going to dry.
614,00:34:11.77,00:34:11.77,Sleeping last night soaking wet really sucked.
615,00:34:17.40,00:34:17.40,Home would be so nice. We did not purchase
616,00:34:21.57,00:34:21.57,any clothes in the village. We didn't think it was necessary
617,00:34:23.47,00:34:23.47,"at the time. >> Hey, girlie."
618,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,">> Out of all the things that could happen,"
619,00:34:28.00,00:34:28.00,"I never thought that this would be one of them, to just"
620,00:34:30.97,00:34:30.97,have whatever you had on and that was it.
621,00:34:33.20,00:34:33.20,"Man, I got to cut these damn pants off."
622,00:34:35.73,00:34:35.73,"( giggles ) I'm wearing my fancy,"
623,00:34:38.47,00:34:38.47,my dress jeans. Suckers were thick and hard and
624,00:34:40.90,00:34:40.90,heavy. Them pants killed my crotch
625,00:34:46.30,00:34:46.30,where nice wet denim rubs for a day and a half
626,00:34:49.53,00:34:49.53,and just starts eating that skin away.
627,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,>> I do not want to wear my sneakers today.
628,00:34:55.43,00:34:55.43,"I want them to just dry for once, just once."
629,00:34:58.03,00:34:58.03,>> Yeah. >> A lot of us were pretty
630,00:35:00.77,00:35:00.77,"miserable, but it was like, ""Wait a second."""
631,00:35:02.27,00:35:02.27,There's really a lot of stuff that you can do with just a
632,00:35:04.50,00:35:04.50,few pieces of clothing. I can cut that seam right there
633,00:35:07.53,00:35:07.53,and make it a top and tie it. >> That could be a really
634,00:35:10.47,00:35:10.47,"good top for you, actually. >> I can't tell you"
635,00:35:12.20,00:35:12.20,how much better this feels. This wet thing has been
636,00:35:14.33,00:35:14.33,draping on me for days now. >> I can walk in these.
637,00:35:19.53,00:35:19.53,>> Finally making some shorts. >> Want me to cut it?
638,00:35:22.10,00:35:22.10,">> I'm wearing a nice Armani suit, but I had no choice--"
639,00:35:24.80,00:35:24.80,"they just had to come off. Yeah, baby."
640,00:35:27.43,00:35:27.43,Beautiful. ( laughing )
641,00:35:29.87,00:35:29.87,">> As shorts, they dry in half the time, but I saved the"
642,00:35:32.53,00:35:32.53,"bottoms, 'cause I'm planning on making them into convertible"
643,00:35:34.40,00:35:34.40,pants for the night. >> We can get two skirts
644,00:35:36.43,00:35:36.43,"out of this, and the bottom part will be big enough for you."
645,00:35:38.97,00:35:38.97,>> Okay. Definitely.
646,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,"My dress was falling apart, so we decided to go ahead"
647,00:35:44.80,00:35:44.80,"and improvise. >> All right, chop her up."
648,00:35:48.57,00:35:48.57,We had a little fashion club meeting and took apart her
649,00:35:51.97,00:35:51.97,dress... >> That is...
650,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,">> Oh, that is a skirt. You hold this."
651,00:35:57.73,00:35:57.73,I want to put this on me now. >> Half of her dress is now
652,00:36:02.10,00:36:02.10,a skirt for Michelle... and the other half is a skirt
653,00:36:05.07,00:36:05.07,for Blackbeard. >> What do you think?
654,00:36:08.00,00:36:08.00,"( all laughing ) >> My God, my thighs"
655,00:36:10.47,00:36:10.47,feel so much better. I got the little teasing
656,00:36:13.67,00:36:13.67,and laughing with the girls as we made it and I put it on
657,00:36:16.83,00:36:16.83,and I looked really silly. It's done.
658,00:36:18.40,00:36:18.40,I'm wearing a dress. I'm never gonna put
659,00:36:21.23,00:36:21.23,"them pants back on. >> Hey, you guys want to go"
660,00:36:37.53,00:36:37.53,get some water? >> Yeah...
661,00:36:38.83,00:36:38.83,>> Aren't we gonna look and check our mail?
662,00:36:40.17,00:36:40.17,>> I thought we were gonna all look for water first.
663,00:36:42.93,00:36:42.93,>> The biggest thing that we need is water.
664,00:36:45.07,00:36:45.07,They say we'll go later for the water.
665,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,Personally... we need to do it now.
666,00:36:53.73,00:36:53.73,"Water well... Oh, shut up."
667,00:36:57.57,00:36:57.57,Water well! >> There's a water well
668,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,thing right on the map. >> We were looking everywhere
669,00:37:03.87,00:37:03.87,"for the water source, not thinking, ""Oh, let's look at"
670,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,"the map."" Water well is on our map."
671,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47,>> Oh! >> Oh!
672,00:37:09.97,00:37:09.97,>> Oh! >> Nicely done.
673,00:37:12.73,00:37:12.73,">> Not just a pretty face. >> Looked at the map, found"
674,00:37:15.77,00:37:15.77,"""Water well,"" so it was exciting because we'd been"
675,00:37:18.27,00:37:18.27,needing water for so long. This is our boat.
676,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,">> It's a trail. >> So, it's back here."
677,00:37:23.20,00:37:23.20,>> So... So we should just follow that trail on back there.
678,00:37:25.80,00:37:25.80,">> Yeah, let's go get water. >> Why didn't we check the map"
679,00:37:30.63,00:37:30.63,earlier? That's what makes me angry.
680,00:37:32.37,00:37:32.37,">> Well, we were so busy with everything."
681,00:37:34.03,00:37:34.03,>> I know. We need to kick ass
682,00:37:36.53,00:37:36.53,on that shelter. Here's one of these bad boys.
683,00:37:41.57,00:37:41.57,">> Actually yesterday, we built a half A-frame up against a"
684,00:37:43.67,00:37:43.67,"shale wall. It's actually pretty funny,"
685,00:37:45.60,00:37:45.60,because I think the shale wall was the home
686,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,"to about 300 hermit crabs, which paid us a visit"
687,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"in the middle of the night. So, I thought we should"
688,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,"probably move our shelter, so we're doing a little"
689,00:37:54.10,00:37:54.10,penthouse suite here. It's actually going
690,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,to have a floor. We don't want to be
691,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,"on the floor anymore, so... where the crabs can get"
692,00:37:59.00,00:37:59.00,us. >> One of the biggest things in
693,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,my troop is we tuck our shirts in.
694,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"We look like a Scout, we act like a Scout."
695,00:38:05.73,00:38:05.73,>> Yeah. >> And here I'm running around
696,00:38:07.57,00:38:07.57,with my blouse open... >> You know...
697,00:38:09.73,00:38:09.73,>> My shirt tied at the waist. ( laughing )
698,00:38:12.47,00:38:12.47,I'm gonna come home and they are going to razz me.
699,00:38:14.73,00:38:14.73,>> They're going to critique you.
700,00:38:16.17,00:38:16.17,">> Ooh, baby. >> Lillian, I think I'm her,"
701,00:38:18.17,00:38:18.17,probably her best friend at the moment.
702,00:38:19.60,00:38:19.60,She kind of looks at the other girls as trying to be cute
703,00:38:21.73,00:38:21.73,"and pretty and stuff. And, uh, an-and me,"
704,00:38:23.73,00:38:23.73,me and her go off and have a good time
705,00:38:25.47,00:38:25.47,and talk and stuff. ( Lillian gasps )
706,00:38:26.87,00:38:26.87,>> Damn! ( screaming )
707,00:38:29.20,00:38:29.20,>> Yes! >> Oh! You are wonderful!
708,00:38:32.63,00:38:32.63,>> We did it. >> Oh! Oh!
709,00:38:34.90,00:38:34.90,"Oh, how cool are you? The one person who befriended"
710,00:38:38.80,00:38:38.80,me with sincere friendship was Ryan Shoulders.
711,00:38:43.00,00:38:43.00,"Ryan's a good kid. >> Yeah, I wish this stuff"
712,00:38:45.70,00:38:45.70,was drinkable already. >> I got an idea.
713,00:38:47.77,00:38:47.77,We ain't going to tell them where it's at.
714,00:38:49.83,00:38:49.83,>> I was just thinking that. ( snoring )
715,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,>> I'm a very active person. I don't like to sit around
716,00:39:07.53,00:39:07.53,"doing absolutely nothing, and we had this spear gun,"
717,00:39:10.57,00:39:10.57,"and I looked around, I was like, ""Hey, guys, I think"
718,00:39:12.43,00:39:12.43,"I'm gonna go out."" >> Have you used it before?"
719,00:39:14.50,00:39:14.50,">> Oh, yeah. Shawn went with me, and we went"
720,00:39:25.33,00:39:25.33,out and we were swimming around and got into this
721,00:39:28.20,00:39:28.20,huge mess of fish just all over the place.
722,00:39:33.03,00:39:33.03,">> Burton had the spear at first, then next thing"
723,00:39:35.27,00:39:35.27,"I know, he cocks it... And, all of a sudden,"
724,00:39:40.37,00:39:40.37,we got a fish. ( tribe cheering )
725,00:39:44.30,00:39:44.30,">> All right! Nice work, guys."
726,00:39:46.13,00:39:46.13,">> You know, he's going to be tasty."
727,00:39:47.57,00:39:47.57,>> Yeah. He's a good fish. >> He's going to be very tasty.
728,00:39:49.43,00:39:49.43,">> I'm so excited that, you know, all right, this thing"
729,00:39:51.93,00:39:51.93,works; we can do this. >> That is awesome.
730,00:39:53.80,00:39:53.80,>> Mmm. >> It feels great to be able
731,00:39:58.40,00:39:58.40,"to catch food, but I knew that one fish just wasn't"
732,00:40:00.87,00:40:00.87,"going to be enough, so I took the spear."
733,00:40:10.23,00:40:10.23,"So, I start catching fish. Oh, I got lunch!"
734,00:40:14.40,00:40:14.40,>> Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
735,00:40:17.83,00:40:17.83,">> After I got that, I thought, ""Okay, some more."
736,00:40:20.10,00:40:20.10,"Some more."" >> Is that a catfish?"
737,00:40:24.53,00:40:24.53,( women whooping ) >> I was thrilled.
738,00:40:27.43,00:40:27.43,I've never seen a saltwater catfish.
739,00:40:29.23,00:40:29.23,I didn't know they made such an animal.
740,00:40:34.53,00:40:34.53,>> You got another one? >> Uh-huh.
741,00:40:37.47,00:40:37.47,>> He's going out again? >> He's going to hurt himself.
742,00:40:41.20,00:40:41.20,">> Hey, Rupert. Good job on those fish, man."
743,00:40:46.10,00:40:46.10,">> One, two, three, four, five. Three more."
744,00:40:51.53,00:40:51.53,">> Man, I hate to see Rupert out there."
745,00:40:54.00,00:40:54.00,"Geez. >> Wow, you're getting burned"
746,00:40:55.97,00:40:55.97,"on your shoulders, Rupert. >> You look like you're"
747,00:40:58.20,00:40:58.20,kind of getting red. >> I got to the point
748,00:41:00.53,00:41:00.53,where I thought I was going to get eight of them.
749,00:41:02.40,00:41:02.40,Everybody was going to get their own fish.
750,00:41:04.53,00:41:04.53,"I didn't get eight, but we got us fish."
751,00:41:07.63,00:41:07.63,>> You know what? >> That's the best one
752,00:41:08.80,00:41:08.80,"you caught, right there. >> That one is."
753,00:41:10.60,00:41:10.60,">> No, the other one. >> This guy?"
754,00:41:11.83,00:41:11.83,I know if I could have caught more of these...
755,00:41:13.97,00:41:13.97,">> No, not that one, the other one."
756,00:41:15.40,00:41:15.40,That one. >> That one's a good one.
757,00:41:16.60,00:41:16.60,>> That's the best. >> Rupert's definitely
758,00:41:17.87,00:41:17.87,"a huge asset. I mean, he worked his ass off,"
759,00:41:20.23,00:41:20.23,"but he was beat. I mean, it took him hours to"
760,00:41:22.73,00:41:22.73,"recover from that. >> Man, you are red."
761,00:41:25.07,00:41:25.07,>> I... I am burning up. I had a great day.
762,00:41:29.47,00:41:29.47,I don't know if I can keep up the workload
763,00:41:33.10,00:41:33.10,"that I'm putting on myself, but that's what I told myself"
764,00:41:36.77,00:41:36.77,I was going to do. I'm coming out here
765,00:41:38.50,00:41:38.50,to be the caretaker. I'm trying to make these people
766,00:41:40.80,00:41:40.80,believe that there is no way you can get along without
767,00:41:43.77,00:41:43.77,"me, and I think I'm doing it. >> Compliments to the catcher"
768,00:41:47.80,00:41:47.80,today. >> Absolutely.
769,00:41:49.63,00:41:49.63,>> Everyone did great. >> Everybody.
770,00:41:51.67,00:41:51.67,>> Everyone did great. >> There's mail.
771,00:42:13.00,00:42:13.00,">> Dude, it's our first mail. I guess, let's bring"
772,00:42:16.33,00:42:16.33,it back and show them. >> Great.
773,00:42:18.67,00:42:18.67,We have tree mail! >> We got tree mail!
774,00:42:21.10,00:42:21.10,">> Mail, fools. >> Whoo!"
775,00:42:23.33,00:42:23.33,Read it out loud. >> Read it out loud.
776,00:42:24.53,00:42:24.53,>> It's on. >> Here we go. Here we go.
777,00:42:26.20,00:42:26.20,">> ""You finally arrived and so now it's on."
778,00:42:28.80,00:42:28.80,"""Your first challenge is a test of your brains and your brawn."
779,00:42:31.93,00:42:31.93,"""Like pirates of old, it's the treasure you thirst."
780,00:42:35.40,00:42:35.40,"But no booty will be had if you're voted out first."""
781,00:42:38.27,00:42:38.27,>> You know what booty that is. ( all laughing )
782,00:42:40.57,00:42:40.57,">> Hey, I was thinking for this challenge, seriously,"
783,00:42:42.97,00:42:42.97,the challenge probably won't last very long.
784,00:42:44.80,00:42:44.80,"So, if we just focus for whatever, 15, 20 minutes..."
785,00:42:48.87,00:42:48.87,>> The very first moment Andrew gave the presence
786,00:42:50.70,00:42:50.70,"of a leader, nobody challenged it."
787,00:42:53.53,00:42:53.53,">> Should we maybe... >> Everything, everything..."
788,00:42:54.87,00:42:54.87,>> ...appoint a leader? Someone that just calls the
789,00:42:56.60,00:42:56.60,"shots, so we don't get stuck fighting?"
790,00:42:58.20,00:42:58.20,"It makes no difference to me who it is, but..."
791,00:43:00.27,00:43:00.27,">> We need you. >> Yeah, Andrew."
792,00:43:02.47,00:43:02.47,>> I made a suggestion just because I knew I didn't want
793,00:43:04.83,00:43:04.83,"to be the leader, uh, but I knew that we needed somebody,"
794,00:43:07.27,00:43:07.27,so we appointed Andrew ahead of time as our leader
795,00:43:10.13,00:43:10.13,"before the challenge. >> Let's do it now, then."
796,00:43:12.07,00:43:12.07,"Let's go out there. >> The Morgan Tribe, I think,"
797,00:43:14.53,00:43:14.53,is very ready for the challenge. Biggest concern from my
798,00:43:17.87,00:43:17.87,"standpoint, from our tribe is, uh, Osten was having difficulty"
799,00:43:22.20,00:43:22.20,"with his shorts last couple of days,"
800,00:43:24.13,00:43:24.13,staying up. The crack of his bottom
801,00:43:25.93,00:43:25.93,"kept showing, and we said, during any activity"
802,00:43:29.30,00:43:29.30,"against the other tribe, if his shorts go down,"
803,00:43:31.77,00:43:31.77,"Ryan and I told him that, uh, we're a team,"
804,00:43:34.17,00:43:34.17,"we're a family, and we won't make him embarrassed by being"
805,00:43:37.10,00:43:37.10,"nude, so, we'll, uh, do the same."
806,00:43:52.43,00:43:52.43,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Everybody good?"
807,00:44:05.10,00:44:05.10,Let's get to today's challenge. One of the things
808,00:44:08.20,00:44:08.20,the pirates had to do with all the loot that they
809,00:44:11.10,00:44:11.10,"plundered is protect it. So, that often meant moving"
810,00:44:13.67,00:44:13.67,"from one island to another, and, in the process, they would have"
811,00:44:17.17,00:44:17.17,to transport their artillery. That's what you guys
812,00:44:19.07,00:44:19.07,are going to do today. You're going to transport
813,00:44:21.10,00:44:21.10,the cannons behind you through a series of obstacles
814,00:44:23.87,00:44:23.87,"along a jungle course. First, you're going to take"
815,00:44:27.10,00:44:27.10,apart your cannon and get it through two fences
816,00:44:29.40,00:44:29.40,"blocking the path. Next, you'll hit the rock"
817,00:44:31.83,00:44:31.83,"garden, where you'll have to clear a path to move your cannon"
818,00:44:34.77,00:44:34.77,"forward to the third obstacle, where you're going to have to"
819,00:44:37.37,00:44:37.37,"push, pull and drag your cannon through a mud pit blocked by"
820,00:44:41.47,00:44:41.47,"wooden barriers. Finally, it's a race along"
821,00:44:44.30,00:44:44.30,the shoreline to the finish. One person will carry the tribe
822,00:44:47.20,00:44:47.20,flag. One person will carry the torch.
823,00:44:48.87,00:44:48.87,First tribe to reach the finish line with all eight members and
824,00:44:52.30,00:44:52.30,their cannon intact wins immunity.
825,00:44:54.57,00:44:54.57,Want to get a look at the immunity idol?
826,00:44:55.97,00:44:55.97,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
827,00:44:57.53,00:44:57.53,>> PROBST: The most valuable thing in your 39 days is this
828,00:45:00.67,00:45:00.67,right here. >> Yeah!
829,00:45:02.43,00:45:02.43,( applause ) Okay.
830,00:45:05.20,00:45:05.20,"Big enough stakes. Win this challenge, you're here"
831,00:45:08.23,00:45:08.23,"three more days, you are safe. Lose, somebody from your tribe"
832,00:45:11.53,00:45:11.53,will be the first person voted out at Tribal Council.
833,00:45:14.03,00:45:14.03,Give you a couple of minutes to strategize.
834,00:45:15.97,00:45:15.97,"Wait for my ""go."" Here we go, for immunity."
835,00:45:23.20,00:45:23.20,Survivors ready? Go!
836,00:45:29.27,00:45:29.27,>> Go! ( indistinct voices )

842,00:46:10.53,00:46:10.53,">> PROBST: Guys, you're going to have to take apart your cannons"
843,00:46:12.30,00:46:12.30,to get it through the fence. >> Just push it.
844,00:46:14.33,00:46:14.33,Pull the cart all the way up. >> Watch your feet!
845,00:46:16.50,00:46:16.50,This thing's going to fall. >> Watch your feet!
846,00:46:18.83,00:46:18.83,>> Watch your feet! Break it up!
847,00:46:20.27,00:46:20.27,>> PROBST: All wheels are gonna have to come off to get through
848,00:46:22.33,00:46:22.33,"there. Once everybody's through, you"
849,00:46:24.17,00:46:24.17,"can move through the other one. Let's go, Morgan!"
850,00:46:26.27,00:46:26.27,You're falling behind. >> Here we go.
851,00:46:28.40,00:46:28.40,"Ready? One, two, three."
852,00:46:29.90,00:46:29.90,"Lift ya up. >> Okay, let's go."
853,00:46:32.10,00:46:32.10,>> Ho-Hold on. Hold on. Hold back!
854,00:46:33.93,00:46:33.93,( indistinct shouts ) All right!

857,00:46:42.03,00:46:42.03,>> Okay. >> Let's rock and roll.
858,00:46:45.37,00:46:45.37,>> Go! >> Get that log! Get that log!

861,00:46:59.03,00:46:59.03,"Dude, we can't move all those rocks."
862,00:47:00.80,00:47:00.80,>> Yeah. >> We're not gonna get...

928,00:51:08.20,00:51:08.20,They gave up. And we didn't.

945,00:51:47.13,00:51:47.13,"in the mud and the muck and the stickers and the thorns,"
946,00:51:51.63,00:51:51.63,"( chuckles ): it was hilarious. >> The coolest thing is,"
947,00:51:54.13,00:51:54.13,"thank God, we don't have to send anyone home"
948,00:51:55.80,00:51:55.80,tonight. >> Yeah.
949,00:51:56.50,00:51:56.50,>> 'Cause that would have sucked.
950,00:51:57.90,00:51:57.90,">> Exactly right. >> You know, that sucked,"
951,00:52:09.07,00:52:09.07,any way you look at it. We lost by about a foot.
952,00:52:13.60,00:52:13.60,"We learn from it. We move on, and we kick"
953,00:52:16.97,00:52:16.97,their butt the next time. And we remember how cocky
954,00:52:20.20,00:52:20.20,they were when they won. All right?
955,00:52:28.47,00:52:28.47,">> Hey, guys. We were just talking"
956,00:52:30.53,00:52:30.53,and just thinking about... >> You were?
957,00:52:31.77,00:52:31.77,What were you talking about? >> We were...
958,00:52:33.30,00:52:33.30,"we were just thinking about, obviously, tonight."
959,00:52:36.37,00:52:36.37,>> You ladies saw what we saw. >> What did you see?
960,00:52:39.03,00:52:39.03,">> I saw our friend Ryan, who's back at the camp,"
961,00:52:41.97,00:52:41.97,just quit about a third of the way in.
962,00:52:44.30,00:52:44.30,"And every time I looked over, he said, ""What?"""
963,00:52:46.67,00:52:46.67,"It's like... >> With Lilly, I mean,"
964,00:52:50.73,00:52:50.73,"she works hard when it comes to the fire and the water,"
965,00:52:52.87,00:52:52.87,but we all can do fire and water.
966,00:52:55.00,00:52:55.00,>> I think it's a big mistake if we expect other challenges
967,00:52:57.00,00:52:57.00,to be less strenuous. >> Yeah!
968,00:52:58.67,00:52:58.67,">> So, the question is, is Lilly up for that"
969,00:53:01.63,00:53:01.63,"or are we better off with the limp noodle, Ryan?"
970,00:53:05.33,00:53:05.33,>> But I don't fit in here with the girls.
971,00:53:07.57,00:53:07.57,I don't fit in with the boys. >> Hang in there.
972,00:53:10.77,00:53:10.77,"This thing changes every day. >> I took the challenge loss,"
973,00:53:14.20,00:53:14.20,"I think, the hardest, because I feel like I am..."
974,00:53:18.67,00:53:18.67,going to be encouraged to leave. ( chuckles )
975,00:53:21.90,00:53:21.90,">> When your torch goes out, then give up."
976,00:53:24.53,00:53:24.53,>> All right. >> 'Cause it's over then.
977,00:53:27.20,00:53:27.20,( Lillian sighs ) >> But not until then.
978,00:53:29.47,00:53:29.47,">> I think my teammates like me, but someone has to go."
979,00:53:33.07,00:53:33.07,>> Do you want to try and crack one of them?
980,00:53:35.43,00:53:35.43,">> No one else has said ""Side with me,"" other than Nicole."
981,00:53:40.67,00:53:40.67,">> Uh... Lill, I think Tijuana is the person"
982,00:53:43.43,00:53:43.43,that I think needs to be taken care of quickly.
983,00:53:45.73,00:53:45.73,"And, at this point, while we're still building the shelter,"
984,00:53:48.03,00:53:48.03,we don't want to get rid of any of the guys.
985,00:53:49.77,00:53:49.77,"( chuckles ) Truth... truth be told,"
986,00:53:51.30,00:53:51.30,"I like all of them. >> Nicole came to me, and..."
987,00:53:55.50,00:53:55.50,"she wants to get rid of Tijuana. You know, okay."
988,00:54:02.23,00:54:02.23,"You know, why? Well, this is..."
989,00:54:04.37,00:54:04.37,"this is what went on for me. Nicole comes to me, she tells"
990,00:54:08.53,00:54:08.53,"me, ""Let's get rid of Tijuana."" >> What?"
991,00:54:10.67,00:54:10.67,That's a hell of a strategy. She says she's bugging her...
992,00:54:13.63,00:54:13.63,"da da da. ""Will you help me?"""
993,00:54:15.50,00:54:15.50,"And I'm going, geez, you know, that didn't sound too cool."
994,00:54:20.30,00:54:20.30,>> Lilly... I had... had some conversations
995,00:54:22.47,00:54:22.47,"with her, and I believe everything she says."
996,00:54:24.27,00:54:24.27,I don't think she has a dishonest bone in her body.
997,00:54:27.67,00:54:27.67,"Lill said Nicole came to her and said, ""Will you"
998,00:54:31.30,00:54:31.30,"form an alliance ""with me to vote off..."
999,00:54:34.17,00:54:34.17,">> Are you serious? >> Tijua..."" Wait, wait."
1000,00:54:35.53,00:54:35.53,"...to vote off Tijuana."" >> Nicole approached Lilly"
1001,00:54:38.20,00:54:38.20,because Tijuana was apparently being too bossy and was
1002,00:54:40.80,00:54:40.80,annoying Nicole. >> Are you serious?
1003,00:54:42.70,00:54:42.70,">> They're saying, too... >> She told me that Lill went"
1004,00:54:45.00,00:54:45.00,"to her. So she blamed it on Lill,"
1005,00:54:46.73,00:54:46.73,and it's Nicole that's doing it. >> Lill has not denied it.
1006,00:54:50.40,00:54:50.40,Lill just tells you the truth. We're just trying to figure out
1007,00:54:53.23,00:54:53.23,who said what to whom and... and whether Nicole can be
1008,00:54:56.00,00:54:56.00,trusted. >> Ooh! Ooh!
1009,00:54:57.20,00:54:57.20,That pisses me off. What I had to do
1010,00:55:00.63,00:55:00.63,is find out is Nicole lying. Was she really trying to put me
1011,00:55:03.47,00:55:03.47,on the cutting block? I really believe that she was.
1012,00:55:05.80,00:55:05.80,I think Lill... I just don't think she has a
1013,00:55:07.97,00:55:07.97,reason to lie. >> All I want to know is who's
1014,00:55:10.13,00:55:10.13,backstabbing me. I don't have any...
1015,00:55:11.80,00:55:11.80,>> Nobody's backstabbing you. Nobody's voting for you.
1016,00:55:13.70,00:55:13.70,>> Somebody obviously is. >> How?
1017,00:55:15.23,00:55:15.23,"I did talk to Lillian to get rid of Tijuana,"
1018,00:55:17.27,00:55:17.27,but word got out of that because Lill's freaked out that
1019,00:55:19.90,00:55:19.90,"she's getting voted off tonight, so she's telling everybody."
1020,00:55:21.97,00:55:21.97,"I set myself up in a really bad position,"
1021,00:55:23.43,00:55:23.43,"telling some truths, telling some half-truths"
1022,00:55:25.07,00:55:25.07,and trying to get things to go my way.
1023,00:55:26.97,00:55:26.97,She approached me. >> Somebody's lying.
1024,00:55:28.87,00:55:28.87,"It's either Lill or it's you. And that's not a good thing,"
1025,00:55:31.47,00:55:31.47,because who knows when you're going to be talked about or
1026,00:55:34.43,00:55:34.43,lied about? >> I was getting along
1027,00:55:36.20,00:55:36.20,"with Nicole there for a little while,"
1028,00:55:38.07,00:55:38.07,"which I still am. But, you know, now I don't know"
1029,00:55:39.90,00:55:39.90,if I can trust her. >> Okay.
1030,00:55:40.80,00:55:40.80,>> You've made me feel very uncomfortable in this situation.
1031,00:55:43.07,00:55:43.07,>> But you're not listening. He told me.
1032,00:55:45.23,00:55:45.23,"I didn't create it. He told me, so I came"
1033,00:55:47.77,00:55:47.77,directly to you. I didn't want to make a
1034,00:55:49.23,00:55:49.23,judgment call. >> And then you would go and...
1035,00:55:50.73,00:55:50.73,I wanted to ask you. I wanted to ask you.
1036,00:55:52.10,00:55:52.10,">> If you don't trust me, and if you think I'm out"
1037,00:55:53.57,00:55:53.57,to get people... >> I want to trust you.
1038,00:55:54.90,00:55:54.90,>> ...why would you want to have an alliance?
1039,00:55:56.17,00:55:56.17,">> That's why I'm asking you. As far as Nicole, I think it is"
1040,00:55:59.03,00:55:59.03,enemy status. It's gotten to that point.
1041,00:56:00.70,00:56:00.70,"I can't trust her. So, yeah, she's definitely an"
1042,00:56:02.87,00:56:02.87,enemy. She came right off the bat
1043,00:56:04.47,00:56:04.47,trying to take me down. For what purposes?
1044,00:56:06.33,00:56:06.33,For what? >> The people that I
1045,00:56:11.50,00:56:11.50,"think are at risk? >> You're hungry, aren't you?"
1046,00:56:14.17,00:56:14.17,>> Skinny Ryan. I don't...
1047,00:56:15.17,00:56:15.17,he just hasn't been pulling his weight at camp
1048,00:56:17.03,00:56:17.03,"or at the challenge. >> Well, we gotta go."
1049,00:56:19.40,00:56:19.40,">> Nicole, with the high drama today, she's been labeled in"
1050,00:56:22.97,00:56:22.97,some people's eyes as being dishonest.
1051,00:56:25.47,00:56:25.47,"And, uh, so her neck's on the line, because we don't"
1052,00:56:28.60,00:56:28.60,"know if we can trust her. And Lilly, is her neck"
1053,00:56:31.63,00:56:31.63,"on the chopping block? Yeah, she's"
1054,00:56:34.03,00:56:34.03,"definitely, uh, a contender to be voted out tonight."
1055,00:57:03.97,00:57:03.97,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: I want you to grab a
1056,00:57:26.87,00:57:26.87,torch and approach the flame. Dip your torch in and get fire.
1057,00:57:33.73,00:57:33.73,"This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council, because"
1058,00:57:37.20,00:57:37.20,fire represents life on the island and in this game.
1059,00:57:39.87,00:57:39.87,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
1060,00:57:42.03,00:57:42.03,Put your torches back in their slot and have a seat.
1061,00:57:47.50,00:57:47.50,"Welcome to your first Tribal Council,"
1062,00:57:51.37,00:57:51.37,"not the place you want to be. But, uh, before we get"
1063,00:57:54.20,00:57:54.20,"to the vote, let's talk about the challenge, the reason you"
1064,00:57:57.27,00:57:57.27,guys are here tonight. It's one thing to get naked
1065,00:58:00.90,00:58:00.90,"for no apparent reason and win, but it's another thing entirely"
1066,00:58:04.90,00:58:04.90,to have three guys walking around naked and lose a
1067,00:58:07.53,00:58:07.53,challenge. Any regrets about that?
1068,00:58:10.30,00:58:10.30,>> Absolutely not. Not a regret.
1069,00:58:12.00,00:58:12.00,What's in the past is in the past.
1070,00:58:13.83,00:58:13.83,"We did it and we move on, period."
1071,00:58:18.23,00:58:18.23,">> PROBST: So, how has it been, Ryan?"
1072,00:58:20.60,00:58:20.60,How are the first three days of getting along with these
1073,00:58:23.10,00:58:23.10,people that you didn't know? The first three days has
1074,00:58:25.73,00:58:25.73,been good for me. I... I get along with everybody.
1075,00:58:29.57,00:58:29.57,"Everybody's really cool, everybody's really helpful,"
1076,00:58:31.60,00:58:31.60,"but... food, I could care less about."
1077,00:58:34.27,00:58:34.27,"The water aspect, I'm struggling a little bit."
1078,00:58:38.00,00:58:38.00,">> PROBST: Andrew, has water been the toughest part?"
1079,00:58:39.57,00:58:39.57,>> No. Uh... I'm very...
1080,00:58:41.20,00:58:41.20,"I'm hydrated. For me, it's the sleep."
1081,00:58:43.43,00:58:43.43,I haven't had more than 45 minutes sleep
1082,00:58:45.83,00:58:45.83,the last three nights. >> PROBST: Why?
1083,00:58:48.10,00:58:48.10,">> Well, we built a fashionable hut, and we put a floor down."
1084,00:58:53.30,00:58:53.30,"And the poles were uneven, so that didn't work very well."
1085,00:58:56.17,00:58:56.17,"So, we didn't quite get the job done."
1086,00:58:58.00,00:58:58.00,">> PROBST: Lill, you're a scoutmaster, right?"
1087,00:59:00.57,00:59:00.57,"I mean, the... it's not just decorative."
1088,00:59:02.83,00:59:02.83,>> No. It... it's hard-earned. It's 11 years of being
1089,00:59:05.67,00:59:05.67,"scoutmaster of, um, troop 617 in Cincinnati, Ohio."
1090,00:59:09.93,00:59:09.93,>> PROBST: And has that served you well out here?
1091,00:59:11.80,00:59:11.80,>> It has served me well. It has also given me patience.
1092,00:59:16.07,00:59:16.07,"Uh, you can't work with a bunch of young children"
1093,00:59:18.40,00:59:18.40,"without having patience, so... I'm patient."
1094,00:59:25.07,00:59:25.07,>> PROBST: Let's talk about friendships.
1095,00:59:27.00,00:59:27.00,"How about you, Nicole? Friendships out here?"
1096,00:59:29.07,00:59:29.07,"Um, I think I have some social friendships, but I don't..."
1097,00:59:32.57,00:59:32.57,I think it's too early to trust anybody.
1098,00:59:34.43,00:59:34.43,I've already seen several sides of a few people.
1099,00:59:36.70,00:59:36.70,"Just when questioned or when threatened,"
1100,00:59:38.77,00:59:38.77,I've seen people that are normally very cheerful
1101,00:59:40.50,00:59:40.50,and very positive turn very defensive.
1102,00:59:43.20,00:59:43.20,"Um, having me feel funny, that was from the very first day."
1103,00:59:46.53,00:59:46.53,>> PROBST: Has anybody emerged as a leader that... that you
1104,00:59:50.70,00:59:50.70,guys are looking to now to make decisions?
1105,00:59:52.57,00:59:52.57,Lill? >> Um...
1106,00:59:55.23,00:59:55.23,"Andrew is our leader. We've elected him as a team,"
1107,00:59:58.47,00:59:58.47,and he's done an excellent job. He's willing to listen
1108,01:00:01.17,01:00:01.17,"to each one of us, and I like that in leadership."
1109,01:00:04.67,01:00:04.67,">> PROBST: Andrew, as the leader, anybody here not"
1110,01:00:06.63,01:00:06.63,pulling their weight? >> Young Ryan.
1111,01:00:09.93,01:00:09.93,"At the challenge, we were side by side, I'm"
1112,01:00:11.93,01:00:11.93,"pulling the left-hand side, and he didn't wake up"
1113,01:00:14.10,01:00:14.10,and show me the passion that we needed.
1114,01:00:16.40,01:00:16.40,"So... yeah, I don't think he was pulling his weight."
1115,01:00:19.53,01:00:19.53,">> PROBST: So, Ryan, first three days, you been pulling your"
1116,01:00:21.67,01:00:21.67,weight? >> I know there has been some
1117,01:00:24.53,01:00:24.53,talk among some people that I didn't give my 110%
1118,01:00:29.03,01:00:29.03,"at the, uh, at the immunity challenge."
1119,01:00:30.97,01:00:30.97,And I thought I was giving 120%.
1120,01:00:33.23,01:00:33.23,"If they see me otherwise, that's fine."
1121,01:00:34.97,01:00:34.97,We'll go on. >> PROBST: Okay.
1122,01:00:36.80,01:00:36.80,"It is time to vote. Nicole, you're up first."
1123,01:00:50.73,01:00:50.73,">> Ryan S., I'm voting for you because you're the only person"
1124,01:00:53.77,01:00:53.77,I know other people are planning to vote for.
1125,01:01:16.57,01:01:16.57,">> Nicole, you stabbed me in the back."
1126,01:01:19.77,01:01:19.77,"Fortunately, I found out and I was able to save myself."
1127,01:01:46.20,01:01:46.20,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
1128,01:02:02.23,01:02:02.23,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
1129,01:02:04.07,01:02:04.07,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
1130,01:02:06.17,01:02:06.17,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
1131,01:02:12.97,01:02:12.97,First vote... Nicole.
1132,01:02:21.57,01:02:21.57,"Ryan S. One vote Ryan, one vote Nicole."
1133,01:02:29.23,01:02:29.23,"Nicole. Two votes Nicole, one vote Ryan."
1134,01:02:36.97,01:02:36.97,Three votes Nicole. Nicole.
1135,01:02:44.63,01:02:44.63,That's four votes Nicole. The first person voted out
1136,01:02:50.70,01:02:50.70,"of the Pearl Islands, Nicole."
1137,01:02:53.43,01:02:53.43,"You need to bring me your torch. Nicole, the tribe has spoken."
1138,01:03:07.53,01:03:07.53,It's time for you to go. Judging from tonight's
1139,01:03:19.83,01:03:19.83,"Tribal Council, it's clear a couple of you certainly"
1140,01:03:22.33,01:03:22.33,thought that could have been your torch.
1141,01:03:24.00,01:03:24.00,"So, maybe the thing to be learned is that you are"
1142,01:03:26.93,01:03:26.93,not out of this game until your torch is snuffed.
1143,01:03:31.03,01:03:31.03,Keep that in your head over the next 36 days.
1144,01:03:34.10,01:03:34.10,"You can always save yourself. Grab your torches,"
1145,01:03:36.80,01:03:36.80,head back to camp. Good night.

1156,01:04:19.63,01:04:19.63,It's a real morale killer for the tribe.

1158,01:04:30.00,01:04:30.00,was going to be keeping my mouth shut.

1160,01:04:33.20,01:04:33.20,I just can't seem to keep it in.
1161,01:04:34.67,01:04:34.67,"Um, based on past experiences in my life,"
1162,01:04:37.37,01:04:37.37,it doesn't surprise me that I'm sitting here.
1163,01:04:39.13,01:04:39.13,"Um, I knew I'd either be the first person off"
1164,01:04:41.10,01:04:41.10,"or the person that won. So, it was one of the toughest"
1165,01:04:43.73,01:04:43.73,"things I've ever done. And, even with a million"
1166,01:04:45.67,01:04:45.67,"dollars at stake, I still had to say what I"
1167,01:04:47.57,01:04:47.57,thought when I thought it. And that's exactly
1168,01:04:49.03,01:04:49.03,what did me in. I sort of shot myself
1169,01:04:50.67,01:04:50.67,in the foot by trying to make an alliance early on to get rid
1170,01:04:53.53,01:04:53.53,"of someone that was just annoying me, um, which I see"
1171,01:04:55.80,01:04:55.80,now in hindsight is probably not the best way to play the game.
