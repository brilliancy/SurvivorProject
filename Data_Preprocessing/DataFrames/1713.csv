191,00:13:28.00,00:13:32.92,>> It does.>> It's even got pockets.
192,00:13:32.92,00:13:34.21,">> Hey, guys.>> Hi."
193,00:13:34.21,00:13:37.79,">> Welcome to Mbenge, theGorilla Project."
194,00:13:37.79,00:13:39.04,>> Nice to meet you.I'm Bob. 
195,00:13:39.04,00:13:40.75,>> Nice to meet you.>> Nice to meet you.
196,00:13:40.75,00:13:43.25,">> After we cleaned up, somerangers came in and spoke to us"
197,00:13:43.25,00:13:46.12,about the Gorilla Project.It's called Africa's Eden.
198,00:13:46.12,00:13:49.21,">> So, we're a sanctuary anda rehabilitation center."
199,00:13:53.21,00:13:57.17,">> So, the rangers explainedeverything about gorillas."
200,00:13:57.17,00:13:59.08,They said they were really indanger because of people
201,00:13:59.08,00:14:02.08,"poaching them in Africa, gettinggorilla meat, and what's left"
202,00:14:02.08,00:14:06.00,"is baby orphaned gorillas, andthey have nowhere to go."
203,00:14:09.12,00:14:13.08,">> We walked down to anobservation platform, and we"
204,00:14:13.08,00:14:16.33,"sat there for quite some time,just sort of getting them used"
205,00:14:16.33,00:14:30.17,"to us.And then Mbakai, the large"
206,00:14:30.17,00:14:39.17,"silverback gorilla, stepped out.His head is enormous."
207,00:14:39.17,00:14:43.96,We were 25 feet from him.He was right there.
208,00:14:43.96,00:14:48.71,"I'm not usually spiritual, butthere was a feeling like there"
209,00:14:48.71,00:14:54.54,"was a connection between thesegreat apes and myself, how they"
210,00:14:54.54,00:14:57.08,"were looking at us, and we werelooking at them."
211,00:14:57.08,00:15:00.21,And it just...It did sort of rock my soul.
212,00:15:24.04,00:15:28.12,">> Coming to Exile, I know thatSugar has the idol, so I went"
213,00:15:28.12,00:15:30.71,ahead and took my chances andjust enjoyed the comfort and the
214,00:15:30.71,00:15:33.33,fruit just to get away from thewhole game.
215,00:15:38.08,00:15:41.58,People back at Nobag have no idea what they're missing.
216,00:15:41.58,00:15:44.58,"It was pretty easy choosing thecomfort, actually."
217,00:15:44.58,00:15:47.88,But the one great thing aboutbeing at Exile is it takes you
218,00:15:47.88,00:15:50.88,"away from the game.You can just step away and say,"
219,00:15:50.88,00:15:53.00,"""I don't have to think aboutanything right now."""
220,00:15:53.00,00:15:55.79,"I think I'm going to have tochange it from ""Sugar Shack"" to"
221,00:15:55.79,00:16:14.88,"""Susie Shack."">> Well, we went on a cool"
222,00:16:14.88,00:16:17.08,reward and they didn't get to doanything.
223,00:16:17.08,00:16:19.25,>> I've been gunning forCrystal and Kenny this entire
224,00:16:19.25,00:16:20.92,game.>> Really?
225,00:16:20.92,00:16:23.83,">> Yeah, really.>> Well, I'll tell you what."
226,00:16:23.83,00:16:26.04,You better win that thingtomorrow because you're the
227,00:16:26.04,00:16:28.88,biggest threat now.I wouldn't want to be Matty
228,00:16:28.88,00:16:30.88,right now because he knowshe's next.
229,00:16:30.88,00:16:34.96,"If it's not Bob, who is it?In my alliance with Kenny and"
230,00:16:34.96,00:16:36.08,Crystal...>> It is your alliance.
231,00:16:36.08,00:16:38.00,>> It's me and Kenny andCrystal.
232,00:16:38.00,00:16:40.25,>> So now you're choosing themas your alliance?
233,00:16:40.25,00:16:42.79,Brilliant thinking.You're the evil three.
234,00:16:42.79,00:16:44.25,">> We're not the evil three,dude."
235,00:16:44.25,00:16:46.00,">> I don't know, man.>> It's mostly with me and"
236,00:16:46.00,00:16:47.92,"Kenny.Unless, you know, he could"
237,00:16:47.92,00:16:50.29,totally be taking me for a ride.>> He is taking you for a ride
238,00:16:50.29,00:16:52.00,because his main alliance isCrystal.
239,00:16:52.00,00:16:54.12,"I know for 1,000%. >> I'm sure Kenny is probably"
240,00:16:54.12,00:16:58.46,"lying to me, but Matty is thestronger physical threat, so"
241,00:16:58.46,00:17:01.92,I don't know who to believe.I don't know who to turn to.
242,00:17:01.92,00:17:04.04,I'm pretty sure you and Bobwill win.
243,00:17:04.04,00:17:11.17,">> Well, you have the idol.>> Nobody's going to vote for"
244,00:17:11.17,00:17:13.50,you.>> We'll see.
245,00:17:13.50,00:17:17.33,">> Not with having the idol.>> Oh, Matty."
246,00:17:17.33,00:17:19.83,I'm certainly not going togive Matty my idol.
247,00:17:19.83,00:17:21.25,"Screw that.At this point, I'm using my"
248,00:17:21.25,00:17:23.38,idol to make sure I'm in thefinal five.
249,00:17:23.38,00:17:25.17,">> If Bob takes the nextimmunity challenge, they're"
250,00:17:25.17,00:17:27.17,voting for me.>> I would say that's accurate.
251,00:17:27.17,00:17:30.75,>> My status now is I'mbasically on my own.
252,00:17:30.75,00:17:33.50,"And I'm not getting any helpfrom anybody, and if I don't win"
253,00:17:33.50,00:17:35.88,"the next immunity challenge,I think I'm packing up my bags"
254,00:17:35.88,00:17:59.42,and going home.>> Yay!
255,00:17:59.42,00:18:01.38,Was it the best ever?>> Yes.
256,00:18:01.38,00:18:03.25,">> All right, tell us about it.>> Look at this."
257,00:18:03.25,00:18:05.42,>> Your shirt is clean?>> Yes.
258,00:18:05.42,00:18:08.08,">> Oh, my God.Let me wear it. "
259,00:18:08.08,00:18:09.79,>> This is...The green is a lot.
260,00:18:09.79,00:18:12.29,">> It's cool that Bob went onthe experience, but he chose"
261,00:18:12.29,00:18:16.04,"Kenny and Crystal, which wasso annoying and frustrating to"
262,00:18:16.04,00:18:19.17,me because those two just...I don't know. 
263,00:18:19.17,00:18:22.38,I'm having a hard time withthose two still.
264,00:18:22.38,00:18:24.50,">> I can feel it, Matty, thatyou're, like, mad at me."
265,00:18:24.50,00:18:26.04,"So, I don't know why you'retrying to hide it."
266,00:18:26.04,00:18:28.12,>> I never voted for you.You said we were going to the
267,00:18:28.12,00:18:30.25,"end together, Kenny.>> There's no reason to be"
268,00:18:30.25,00:18:31.75,upset.>> I have good reason.
269,00:18:31.75,00:18:33.12,My name was written down threetimes here.
270,00:18:33.12,00:18:35.67,">> My name's been written downeight, one of them by you."
271,00:18:35.67,00:18:37.38,"You still, to this day, say""Crystal, thank you for not"
272,00:18:37.38,00:18:39.67,"writing my name down."">> My name has been written"
273,00:18:39.67,00:18:42.12,down seven times already.>> I don't care.
274,00:18:42.12,00:18:44.33,">> Think about that.>> Hey, Kenny, don't talk about"
275,00:18:44.33,00:18:48.04,"it anymore, okay, bro?>> No, I'm mad."
276,00:18:48.04,00:18:50.54,Matty is super paranoid.Ever since his name was written
277,00:18:50.54,00:18:52.29,down.It was a strategic move on my
278,00:18:52.29,00:18:54.00,"part, but...It's a game."
279,00:18:54.00,00:18:56.21,People write down names.>> Let him be scared.
280,00:18:56.21,00:18:59.04,Karma's a bitch in this game.Right now I'm throwing the stink
281,00:18:59.04,00:19:01.46,"on Matty, so everybody else cansmell it and write his name"
282,00:19:01.46,00:19:11.58,down.>> Mm-hmm.
283,00:19:13.92,00:19:16.17,>> Because you and Sue are likethat.
284,00:19:16.17,00:19:18.58,>> I am like that with Sue.I like Sue.
285,00:19:18.58,00:19:20.17,I like spending time with Sueout here.
286,00:19:20.17,00:19:22.33,I don't trust her.>> You can look me in the eye
287,00:19:22.33,00:19:24.25,and say you don't trust Sue.>> I don't trust Sue.
288,00:19:24.25,00:19:27.08,>> You're lying.>> What?
289,00:19:27.08,00:19:29.29,">> You've changed, and it's notfor the good."
290,00:19:29.29,00:19:30.92,"But if you (blip) me and Kennyover, karma is a bitch."
291,00:19:30.92,00:19:32.17,>> Why are you getting mad atme?
292,00:19:32.17,00:19:33.29,I didn't do anything.>> Because me and Kenny have
293,00:19:33.29,00:19:34.88,been there for you from dayone.
294,00:19:34.88,00:19:36.50,>> What do you mean?What do you want from me?
295,00:19:36.50,00:19:38.08,>> I don't want anything fromyou.
296,00:19:38.08,00:19:41.58,I don't want anything from you.>> I have no idea what's
297,00:19:41.58,00:19:44.17,happening right now.Crystal is going off on Matty
298,00:19:44.17,00:19:47.50,"for no reason, and I've alreadyseen Kenny go off on Matty, and"
299,00:19:47.50,00:19:52.46,Matty doesn't deserve to beyelled at.
300,00:19:52.46,00:19:54.21,">> What am I doing wrong,Crystal?"
301,00:19:54.21,00:19:56.58,>> Keep doing what you're doing.But where did this come from?
302,00:19:56.58,00:19:59.21,">> Matty is right, I think,that Crystal and Kenny have"
303,00:19:59.21,00:20:01.79,been in this together from thebeginning and they just take
304,00:20:01.79,00:20:04.50,"out whoever they want.Kenny acts like he's this weak,"
305,00:20:04.50,00:20:09.21,"little meager guy, and he spinsall these lies, and Crystal is"
306,00:20:09.21,00:20:12.58,just a big bully.This is the thing.
307,00:20:12.58,00:20:15.54,They're not good people.I'm starting to see that about
308,00:20:15.54,00:20:17.104,"Kenny, and I know that aboutCrystal."
309,00:20:19.50,00:20:23.04,">> Do you really, or you just...I don't know what's going on."
310,00:20:23.04,00:20:25.58,">> I don't, either, but now Isee that they're not, like..."
311,00:20:25.58,00:20:27.67,Why would they kick you whenyou're down?
312,00:20:27.67,00:20:30.71,It feels like they're justgoing off on you when you know
313,00:20:30.71,00:20:34.08,you're going.But you're not going.
314,00:20:34.08,00:20:37.00,>> Why don't I just...>> You're not going to go.
315,00:20:39.88,00:20:42.79,"Okay?>> Well, what do we do?"
316,00:20:42.79,00:20:46.42,">> You, me, Bob, and Sue.I have to talk to Bob because"
317,00:20:46.42,00:20:48.08,I know Bob better than anybodyelse.
318,00:20:48.08,00:20:51.71,"At this point.>> Sugar, are you truthful?"
319,00:20:51.71,00:20:54.42,>> I am not...>> If Sugar really is telling
320,00:20:54.42,00:20:59.25,"me the truth, I have hope, and Icould play this game."
321,00:20:59.25,00:21:01.17,"I might have to go to the endwith Bob, and Bob will"

380,00:24:45.38,00:24:50.08,"Bob is back with his second bag.Crystal, miraculously, is"
381,00:24:50.08,00:24:53.79,almost there.Crystal has arrived with her
382,00:24:53.79,00:24:58.29,first bag.Kenny takes a header into a
383,00:24:58.29,00:25:00.62,pole.Even the king can get injured
384,00:25:00.62,00:25:04.42,in this challenge.Everybody working on their mask
385,00:25:04.42,00:25:08.54,now.Bob now heading back for his

392,00:25:38.25,00:25:45.96,final bag.>> I think I have it.
393,00:25:45.96,00:25:53.46,>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it.Bob does not have it.
394,00:25:53.46,00:25:57.71,Matty now coming back afterchecking that mask.
395,00:25:57.71,00:26:01.58,Bob making a lot of changes.Kenny still working on his mask.
396,00:26:01.58,00:26:05.08,"He has all three bags.The question now is, ""Do I have"
397,00:26:05.08,00:26:09.08,"the right pieces?""Crystal not giving up,"
398,00:26:09.08,00:26:11.67,continues to fight in thischallenge.
399,00:26:11.67,00:26:19.67,"Susie trying to find the course.>> I think I have it, Jeff."
400,00:26:19.67,00:26:22.54,>> PROBST: Kenny thinks he hasit.
401,00:26:22.54,00:26:25.50,Kenny is wrong.Kenny going to head back to
402,00:26:25.50,00:26:29.25,check his mask again.Matty very close.
403,00:26:29.25,00:26:32.42,Bob is almost there.Big immunity on the line.
404,00:26:35.75,00:26:39.04,>> I'll just try that.>> PROBST: Bob thinks he has it.
405,00:26:39.04,00:26:43.42,Bob is right!Bob wins immunity!
406,00:26:43.42,00:26:51.33,Four straight challenges.>> Wow.
407,00:26:51.33,00:26:55.83,">> PROBST: Bob, come on over.Once again, immunity is yours."
408,00:26:55.83,00:26:59.58,"Turn around, brother.Once again, Bob is safe at"
409,00:26:59.58,00:27:04.00,"Tribal Council.After 36 long days, Tribal"
410,00:27:04.00,00:27:06.08,Council tonight.One of you will be going home.
411,00:27:06.08,00:27:07.75,Grab your stuff.Head back to camp.
412,00:27:07.75,00:27:11.00,I will see you at Tribal.>> Four challenges in a row.
413,00:27:11.00,00:27:13.46,I'm 57 years old.It felt real good.
414,00:27:13.46,00:27:17.29,Been a good run at four.I never would have guessed that.
415,00:27:17.29,00:27:20.21,>> Bob promised me that if hewon the immunity necklace that
416,00:27:20.21,00:27:22.17,"he'll give it to me.Now, it's up to Bob, you know."
417,00:27:22.17,00:27:25.04,"Actions do speak louder thanwords, and I can only wait to"
418,00:27:25.04,00:27:50.67,see what he does tonight.>> I know you want to get rid
419,00:27:50.67,00:27:53.96,"of Matty.But we get rid of Matty tonight,"
420,00:27:53.96,00:27:56.75,there's a chance Bob lied to meand won't give me the necklace
421,00:27:56.75,00:27:58.62,next time.So I'm going to tell Bob to
422,00:27:58.62,00:28:01.17,give me the necklace tonight.And we got to vote for Bob.
423,00:28:01.17,00:28:03.08,">> Okay, sounds good.>> Is that okay?"
424,00:28:03.08,00:28:04.92,>> I'm cool with that.>> Who would've thought Bob
425,00:28:04.92,00:28:06.29,would be winning all thesechallenges?
426,00:28:06.29,00:28:08.08,But he has been.We should have got rid of him
427,00:28:08.08,00:28:10.38,"when we had the chance, but wekept him in because everybody"
428,00:28:10.38,00:28:13.04,hated Randy.And now we're paying for it.
429,00:28:13.04,00:28:15.08,He's too dangerous at thispoint.
430,00:28:15.08,00:28:17.58,None of us has the chance tomake it to the final three.
431,00:28:17.58,00:28:19.88,">> Okay.In all honesty, I would like"
432,00:28:19.88,00:28:23.08,"to take out Matty, but if it'sBob's name we're going with"
433,00:28:23.08,00:28:26.04,"tonight, Bob it is.As long as it's not Crystal,"
434,00:28:26.04,00:28:35.08,I'm fine.>> Hmm?
435,00:28:35.08,00:28:39.21,Why?Why would you be scared?
436,00:28:39.21,00:28:41.46,">> I don't know.Bob made a deal with me, you"
437,00:28:41.46,00:28:42.92,know.He's going to give me that
438,00:28:42.92,00:28:45.04,"immunity necklace if he wins.If he doesn't, he'll look"
439,00:28:45.04,00:28:46.71,really bad in front ofeverybody.
440,00:28:46.71,00:28:49.50,"If he does, he'll look good infront of everybody, and he'll go"
441,00:28:49.50,00:28:52.71,home.So lose-lose situation for him.
442,00:28:55.12,00:28:58.04,>> Why would they blindside you?We're going to take Matty out.
443,00:29:03.00,00:29:05.17,Why would you feel nervous?>> 'Cause I'm with you.
444,00:29:05.17,00:29:07.88,"There might be the four still.>> Okay, okay."
445,00:29:07.88,00:29:09.96,We'll talk... we'll talk.We'll talk about it.
446,00:29:09.96,00:29:11.100,Let's find out who's votingfor who?
447,00:29:24.75,00:29:36.62,">> What?>> Hey, guys."
448,00:29:47.42,00:29:51.46,>> Kenny has come up with thiselaborate plan to hoax Bob out
449,00:29:51.46,00:29:53.83,of his necklace.If Bob were to give Kenny the
450,00:29:53.83,00:29:56.17,"necklace, then everybody wouldvote for Bob because they want"
451,00:29:56.17,00:29:59.21,to keep their five alliance.I don't want to be aligned with
452,00:29:59.21,00:30:01.21,all those guys.I want to be aligned with the
453,00:30:01.21,00:30:08.38,"good guys.Crystal and Kenny, I've been,"
454,00:30:08.38,00:30:10.58,"like, in an alliance with them.>> Mm-hmm."
455,00:30:10.58,00:30:14.83,">> But just something, somethingis really striking me weird"
456,00:30:14.83,00:30:18.71,"right now that, that I didn'tfeel before."
457,00:30:18.71,00:30:23.62,"And, um, they told me that ifyou give Kenny the, uh, the"
458,00:30:23.62,00:30:26.08,"necklace, then he's going to...they're going to blindside you."
459,00:30:26.08,00:30:30.25,"That's the plan.And, uh, see, I wouldn't know"
460,00:30:30.25,00:30:35.04,that unless they told me that.So... I think that you shouldn't
461,00:30:35.04,00:30:40.42,do everything that they say.I think we need to take them
462,00:30:40.42,00:30:44.62,"out.I mean, I just wanted to talk"
463,00:30:44.62,00:30:46.38,to you about it.You don't have to make any
464,00:30:46.38,00:30:48.04,decisions.You can vote for whoever you
465,00:30:48.04,00:30:49.58,want.>> So where's Susie stand in
466,00:30:49.58,00:30:52.71,all this?>> I-I really don't know what
467,00:30:52.71,00:30:54.88,Susie's doing.I'm sure she's going to vote
468,00:30:54.88,00:30:58.62,for whoever Matty votes for.And I think we should vote for
469,00:30:58.62,00:31:02.62,Crystal.>> Sugar said to me that it was
470,00:31:02.62,00:31:05.88,"a blindside coming, which is aninteresting thing because she"
471,00:31:05.88,00:31:08.00,hasn't done anything to show meI can trust her.
472,00:31:08.00,00:31:11.12,She has not done anything thatshows me I can't trust her.
473,00:31:11.12,00:31:17.121,"So I want to believe, but she's,um, she-she's playing the game."
474,00:31:23.04,00:31:27.00,>> I appreciate that.Um...
475,00:31:27.00,00:31:29.62,">> I mean, it's-it's a bigdecision for you, and I"
476,00:31:29.62,00:31:31.62,understand that.But I just want you to look out
477,00:31:31.62,00:31:36.21,for yourself.I will not vote for you.
478,00:31:36.21,00:31:39.25,"I know you're the biggestthreat, but I don't care."
479,00:31:39.25,00:31:42.121,I just think the good guysshould win in the end.
480,00:31:47.88,00:31:51.12,>> What are we going to do ifhe doesn't give me the idol?
481,00:31:51.12,00:31:58.50,">> I'm going home, obviously.>> Hmm?"
482,00:31:58.50,00:32:00.88,>> I think he might do it.>> Why? What happened?
483,00:32:00.88,00:32:04.08,">> I just talked to him for alittle bit, and I was like..."
484,00:32:04.08,00:32:06.17,"I hate lying to Bob because Ireally, really like Bob."
485,00:32:06.17,00:32:09.08,But it is a game.I just told him that Kenny's
486,00:32:09.08,00:32:12.29,next.I think. We'll see.
487,00:32:19.54,00:32:22.17,">> Bob thinks that I'm on theoutskirts with him, and, um,"
488,00:32:22.17,00:32:25.21,"I've made him think that.Hopefully, he will give me that"
489,00:32:25.21,00:32:27.42,"immunity necklace, and Bob goeshome tonight."
490,00:32:27.42,00:32:31.00,"But if not, then Matty will begoing home instead."
491,00:32:33.54,00:33:05.08,>> Yeah.>> I'm definitely playing my
492,00:33:05.08,00:33:08.25,idol at Tribal because it's mylast day to do it.
493,00:33:08.25,00:33:11.38,"Maybe I should give it to Mattyand save Matty, but I don't"
494,00:33:11.38,00:33:15.08,want anybody to blindside me.Just as long as Matty listens
495,00:33:15.08,00:33:19.21,"to me, and Bob knows to trustme, everything's going to be"
496,00:33:19.21,00:33:39.08,fine.>> PROBST: Now bring in
497,00:33:39.08,00:33:46.00,"the members of our jury.Marcus, Charlie, Randy..."
498,00:33:50.04,00:33:54.75,"and Corinne, voted out at thelast Tribal Council."
499,00:33:54.75,00:33:59.67,"So, Bob, let's start with you.Four challenges in a row."
500,00:33:59.67,00:34:03.92,There's no hiding; you're alegitimate threat in this game.
501,00:34:03.92,00:34:05.83,>> You hit the nail right onthe head.
502,00:34:05.83,00:34:09.75,"It's a huge target on my back.And if I don't win, I could be"
503,00:34:09.75,00:34:12.71,"joining the jury.>> PROBST: Kenny, you start"
504,00:34:12.71,00:34:16.58,"seeing a guy like Bob bring iton strong, he could win his way"
505,00:34:16.58,00:34:20.08,"to the final Tribal Council.>> Yeah, he amazes me, you"
506,00:34:20.08,00:34:23.17,"know, for being as old as he is.He's strong."
507,00:34:23.17,00:34:25.33,He's smart.He's agile.
508,00:34:25.33,00:34:28.12,"He's, he's Bob.>> PROBST: Matty, when you see"
509,00:34:28.12,00:34:31.21,"Bob win challenge afterchallenge, what starts going"
510,00:34:31.21,00:34:33.71,"through your head?>> You know, if anybody is"
511,00:34:33.71,00:34:37.21,"going to dominate at this game,I'm really happy that it's this"
512,00:34:37.21,00:34:40.38,"man next to me, Bob, becauseit's a lot better him having"
513,00:34:40.38,00:34:44.21,that necklace around his neckthan somebody of a little less
514,00:34:44.21,00:34:46.96,"caliber.>> PROBST: Susie, a lot going"
515,00:34:46.96,00:34:50.00,on these last few days.Hard to be away on Exile?
516,00:34:50.00,00:34:52.50,">> Yeah, when you're away likethat and you come back into the"
517,00:34:52.50,00:34:55.83,"game, it's like, wow.You just miss bits and pieces."
518,00:34:55.83,00:34:58.33,"And then I have to rely on myown gut instincts, so..."
519,00:34:58.33,00:35:02.58,"Even now, I'm still not certain.>> PROBST: Kenny, with only six"
520,00:35:02.58,00:35:05.50,"people left, why do you thinkBob chose you as one of the"
521,00:35:05.50,00:35:07.92,people to go on the gorillareward?
522,00:35:07.92,00:35:13.04,">> Um, basically, at the lastTribal Council, uh, I-I flopped."
523,00:35:13.04,00:35:17.17,"I believed in Bob, and once Igot back to camp, everybody"
524,00:35:17.17,00:35:19.17,noticed that I was the one whoflopped.
525,00:35:19.17,00:35:22.29,"And I was very frustrated, and Iasked him, ""Why did you lie to"
526,00:35:22.29,00:35:24.25,"me, Bob?""And Bob promised me something."
527,00:35:24.25,00:35:26.71,He-he told me that he would tryhis best to win the next
528,00:35:26.71,00:35:30.12,"immunity challenge, and he wouldgive me the immunity necklace if"
529,00:35:30.12,00:35:32.88,"he did win it.>> PROBST: Bob, is that true?"
530,00:35:32.88,00:35:34.83,>> That's-that's what I toldhim.
531,00:35:34.83,00:35:38.62,"Uh, we have since then sort ofrenegotiated things."
532,00:35:38.62,00:35:42.17,"Uh, I told him that if I feelthat he is going to go home"
533,00:35:42.17,00:35:44.58,"tonight, that I'd give himthe necklace."
534,00:35:44.58,00:35:47.54,"And after we discuss all this,I'll make that decision."
535,00:35:47.54,00:35:49.58,">> PROBST: And, Kenny, you'remaking the case tonight that"
536,00:35:49.58,00:35:52.21,you feel you're in danger.>> I was at such a great
537,00:35:52.21,00:35:55.08,"position, and now I'm on theoutcast."
538,00:35:55.08,00:35:56.96,"You know, I turned on myalliance."
539,00:35:56.96,00:36:00.75,"Bob has the necklace, and wheream I?"
540,00:36:00.75,00:36:03.12,">> PROBST: Crystal, got to makeyou feel a little good that"
541,00:36:03.12,00:36:07.25,"Bob, who clearly has some powerin this game, picked you as one"
542,00:36:07.25,00:36:09.54,of the people to go on a bigreward.
543,00:36:09.54,00:36:13.79,">> Um, I feel that he chose mebecause I haven't been on a"
544,00:36:13.79,00:36:16.67,reward in the 36 days thatwe've been here.
545,00:36:16.67,00:36:20.00,And I feel honored to at leastget some kind of culture from
546,00:36:20.00,00:36:22.79,"being here in Africa.>> PROBST: Matty, do you think"
547,00:36:22.79,00:36:25.17,that's all it was... Bob justwanted somebody to have a
548,00:36:25.17,00:36:29.25,"cultural experience, nothing todo with an opportunity to bond"
549,00:36:29.25,00:36:32.21,with two people who could helpyou get further in the game?
550,00:36:32.21,00:36:35.25,>> I believe Bob knows thatKenny and Crystal are the
551,00:36:35.25,00:36:38.12,"tightest alliance since day onein this game, and they have"
552,00:36:38.12,00:36:41.04,"honestly dominated this game.>> PROBST: Kenny, you're"
553,00:36:41.04,00:36:43.04,shaking your head.>> I think that everybody
554,00:36:43.04,00:36:46.12,"thinks that me and Crystal arevery tight, but I jumped from"
555,00:36:46.12,00:36:50.04,"my really good position in thefive alliance that I had, and I"
556,00:36:50.04,00:36:52.67,feel like I could be the nextto go.
557,00:36:52.67,00:36:55.08,">> PROBST: So, based on whatyou're saying then, how much"
