33,00:03:58.71,00:03:58.71,it was an adventure for me. I was just like a damn kid at a
34,00:04:02.04,00:04:02.04,carnival. I ain't never been nowhere.
35,00:04:05.67,00:04:05.67,"But I loved it. >> Being Chinese, it's so"
36,00:04:17.08,00:04:17.08,amazing coming to do Survivor in China.
37,00:04:20.04,00:04:20.04,"My grandfather passed away, like, a couple of weeks ago."
38,00:04:24.08,00:04:24.08,And he would have just gotten such a kick out of seeing me

40,00:04:31.92,00:04:31.92,China. I hope you have enjoyed your
41,00:04:34.58,00:04:34.58,"journey so far. Before the game can begin,"
42,00:04:38.21,00:04:38.21,you are going to participate in a Buddhist ceremony inside
43,00:04:42.08,00:04:42.08,"this 400-year-old temple. I want to assure everybody,"
44,00:04:45.21,00:04:45.21,"because I realize everybody has different beliefs, this is not"
45,00:04:48.83,00:04:48.83,a worship ceremony. The people of this land want
46,00:04:52.62,00:04:52.62,you to feel welcome. That's the whole point.
47,00:04:56.04,00:04:56.04,"So, when you're finished, return back out here to me."
48,00:05:04.17,00:05:04.17,(chanting) >> I work as a lunch lady
49,00:05:23.08,00:05:23.08,"behind the counter in the cafeteria, and to actually be"
50,00:05:27.25,00:05:27.25,"in a temple like that, what a great experience."
51,00:05:31.58,00:05:31.58,"It almost made me cry, to tell you the truth."
52,00:05:34.04,00:05:34.04,It was just spiritual. It was very emotional for me.
53,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,">> I'm a waitress from New York City, dude."
54,00:05:49.17,00:05:49.17,What do you think? Do you think I know how to do
55,00:05:51.29,00:05:51.29,any of this stuff? I'm not trying to be a monk
56,00:05:53.42,00:05:53.42,here. I'm tired.
57,00:05:55.25,00:05:55.25,I want to sit back with the lemonade.
58,00:05:58.92,00:05:58.92,"Like, I don't really want to be, like, bowing 37 times."
59,00:06:01.04,00:06:01.04,"And we bowed... we bowed for, like, days."
60,00:06:03.04,00:06:03.04,"I swear to God, we were there forever."
61,00:06:18.25,00:06:18.25,">> I'm a believer in Jesus Christ, and in the Bible it"
62,00:06:21.21,00:06:21.21,"says, ""Thou shall not bow down to any other god."""
63,00:06:24.42,00:06:24.42,"You know, it really felt like worship."
64,00:06:26.71,00:06:26.71,"I mean, we're in a temple. There's the Buddha."
65,00:06:30.62,00:06:30.62,I just couldn't do it. It was emotional for me.
66,00:06:34.25,00:06:34.25,Because I knew I did the right thing.
67,00:06:36.42,00:06:36.42,"But it was so hard. >> PROBST: Okay, so, Leslie, you"
68,00:06:55.50,00:06:55.50,didn't make it through the whole ceremony.
69,00:06:58.42,00:06:58.42,"What happened? >> You know, I'm not a"
70,00:07:00.75,00:07:00.75,"religious person, but I have a relationship with Jesus Christ,"
71,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,and the only time I'm going to put my face on the floor is for
72,00:07:05.17,00:07:05.17,him. >> PROBST: So even though I had
73,00:07:07.08,00:07:07.08,said this was a welcome... >> I really didn't want to be
74,00:07:09.62,00:07:09.62,disrespectful. But it felt like worship.
75,00:07:12.50,00:07:12.50,>> PROBST: Worried that it might impact the next 39 days?
76,00:07:15.21,00:07:15.21,">> You know, I'm really not. I'm just going to play the game"
77,00:07:18.04,00:07:18.04,"and be me. If they like me, great."
78,00:07:19.88,00:07:19.88,"If they don't, you know, I'll deal with that."
79,00:07:24.21,00:07:24.21,>> PROBST: A big theme in Buddhism is the leaving behind
80,00:07:28.71,00:07:28.71,of your worldly possessions. That applies to suitcases.
81,00:07:34.50,00:07:34.50,It means you will be going into this game wearing the clothes
82,00:07:37.50,00:07:37.50,on your back. >> Aarrggh!
83,00:07:40.79,00:07:40.79,">> These are, like, 20 pounds each."
84,00:07:43.25,00:07:43.25,">> I don't have on a bra. >> PROBST: Well, that's going to"
85,00:07:45.42,00:07:45.42,make you either very popular... (laughter)
86,00:07:48.04,00:07:48.04,...or a big liability if you let it get in the way of challenges
87,00:07:50.83,00:07:50.83,or camp life. >> Yeah.
88,00:07:53.67,00:07:53.67,">> PROBST: All right, the game is about to begin."
89,00:07:56.04,00:07:56.04,We're going to divide into tribes.
90,00:07:58.21,00:07:58.21,There's a bag over here for each of you with your name on
91,00:08:00.96,00:08:00.96,"it. Come find your bag, put on your"
92,00:08:03.12,00:08:03.12,buff. >> God!
93,00:08:08.25,00:08:08.25,">> Ashley. >> PROBST: If you have yellow,"
94,00:08:11.71,00:08:11.71,"head to the left. If you have red, head over here"
95,00:08:14.12,00:08:14.12,to the right. Put your buff.
96,00:08:19.08,00:08:19.08,"Yellow tribe-- your name is Zhan Hu, which means ""fighting"
97,00:08:22.79,00:08:22.79,"tiger."" We have Frosti, Dave, Jaime,"
98,00:08:28.38,00:08:28.38,"Erik, Peih-gee, Sherea, Ashley, and Chicken."
99,00:08:36.79,00:08:36.79,">> From the get go, I saw we had a pretty strong team."
100,00:08:39.04,00:08:39.04,"I'm the youngest and the smallest guy out here, so I got"
101,00:08:42.12,00:08:42.12,"to prove my worth. >> PROBST: Red tribe, your name"
102,00:08:44.25,00:08:44.25,"is Fei Long. It means ""flying dragon."""
103,00:08:47.62,00:08:47.62,"We have Jean-Robert, Leslie, Amanda, Courtney, Denise,"
104,00:08:54.08,00:08:54.08,"James, Todd, and Aaron. >> I am so happy to be a Fei"
105,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,Long member. Because I think James and Aaron
106,00:09:06.04,00:09:06.04,are definitely two of our strongest members.
107,00:09:09.25,00:09:09.25,"So, I think we're going to be a powerhouse in challenges."
108,00:09:12.00,00:09:12.00,">> PROBST: All right, you are about to engage in a battle."
109,00:09:14.58,00:09:14.58,"For the next 39 days, you will be involved in a struggle for"
110,00:09:17.92,00:09:17.92,survival. The single greatest document on
111,00:09:20.92,00:09:20.92,"the history of strategy was written by the Chinese, "
112,00:09:24.38,00:09:24.38,The Art of War. Look through this.
113,00:09:27.21,00:09:27.21,There is wisdom about strategy in battle that could help you
114,00:09:31.00,00:09:31.00,win this game and the million dollars.
115,00:09:33.21,00:09:33.21,(laughter) I also have a map for each
116,00:09:36.12,00:09:36.12,"tribe to your new home. Fei Long, come get your Art of"
117,00:09:39.79,00:09:39.79,War and your map. Head out and go to the right.
118,00:09:42.67,00:09:42.67,The boat will be waiting for you.
119,00:09:44.88,00:09:44.88,"Zhan Hu, come get your Art of War and your map."
120,00:09:47.17,00:09:47.17,Head out and go to the left of the temple.
121,00:09:49.50,00:09:49.50,The boat will be waiting for you.
122,00:09:51.21,00:09:51.21,"Good luck, guys. (applause)"
123,00:10:07.71,00:10:07.71,>> The person farthest back has the count.
124,00:10:10.50,00:10:10.50,">> I have a question, does anybody know how to do this?"
125,00:10:14.04,00:10:14.04,">> Let's just all calm down and, like, nice and easy."
126,00:10:17.25,00:10:17.25,So we're all going straight rather than spinning in circles.
127,00:10:20.88,00:10:20.88,"So, we were on this lake in the middle of China."
128,00:10:23.79,00:10:23.79,"We have no idea where we are. You know, it's like rice"
129,00:10:26.25,00:10:26.25,paddies and tropical rain forest.
130,00:10:29.21,00:10:29.21,And I don't think my tribe for the most part knows what's
131,00:10:32.38,00:10:32.38,"going on. Right side, everybody."
132,00:10:34.88,00:10:34.88,"Everybody, right side. No left side."
133,00:10:38.12,00:10:38.12,"I see myself as a leader, but I try and do it as subtly as"
134,00:10:41.04,00:10:41.04,possible. I don't want the target on my
135,00:10:43.21,00:10:43.21,back. (cheers)
136,00:10:48.21,00:10:48.21,>> Fei Long! >> We've got a great team.
137,00:10:55.04,00:10:55.04,">> We do have a good team. >> We've got, like, an axe"
138,00:10:57.08,00:10:57.08,"thing. We've got rice, you guys!"
139,00:11:01.21,00:11:01.21,">> Is that all that's in there, is rice?"
140,00:11:03.08,00:11:03.08,">> Yeah, just great big bag of rice."
141,00:11:04.42,00:11:04.42,">> We're going to keep that dry, you guys."
142,00:11:09.21,00:11:09.21,">> Oh, no. It's raining."
143,00:11:17.21,00:11:17.21,">> What do you do, Todd? >> I'm a flight attendant."
144,00:11:19.50,00:11:19.50,>> You're a flight attendant? No way.
145,00:11:21.46,00:11:21.46,"You are so cute. >> I'm sorry, I am easily"
146,00:11:24.79,00:11:24.79,"irritated. I seem like to be, like, sort"
147,00:11:27.62,00:11:27.62,of marooned in a land of flight attendants and Sunday school
148,00:11:30.17,00:11:30.17,"teachers. Like, come on."
149,00:11:32.21,00:11:32.21,I live in a city. People who live in New York
150,00:11:35.08,00:11:35.08,"don't act like this. >> All right, let's do this."
151,00:11:38.88,00:11:38.88,"Yeah, Fei Long! >> This is like my own private"
152,00:11:41.92,00:11:41.92,"hell. They're, like, exactly the kind"
153,00:11:44.04,00:11:44.04,"of people that I don't like being around, who are all, like,"
154,00:11:47.25,00:11:47.25,"""Everything's always great. Isn't it amazing?"
155,00:11:51.62,00:11:51.62,"Like you're doing a really good job with that."""
156,00:11:54.62,00:11:54.62,>> High five. >> High five!
157,00:12:07.92,00:12:07.92,">> Yeah, dog. Come on, now."
158,00:12:10.21,00:12:10.21,">> It's going to be our tree mail, dude."
159,00:12:12.38,00:12:12.38,">> Oh, man. >> There's nothing here."
160,00:12:15.00,00:12:15.00,>> You said you were a flight attendant?
161,00:12:16.29,00:12:16.29,>> Yeah. >> You really a flight
162,00:12:18.08,00:12:18.08,"attendant? >> Yeah, I really am."
163,00:12:20.04,00:12:20.04,">> For some reason, I don't... I don't know."
164,00:12:22.50,00:12:22.50,>> You don't believe me? >> It's like I kind of believe
165,00:12:24.25,00:12:24.25,you but... >> Why would I lie about a job
166,00:12:26.38,00:12:26.38,"like that? >> I don't know, I don't know."
167,00:12:29.17,00:12:29.17,I don't know. I like you.
168,00:12:35.50,00:12:35.50,"I like you, but for some reason, I... you seem a little"
169,00:12:38.42,00:12:38.42,devious. I'm a professional poker player.
170,00:12:41.21,00:12:41.21,And one of the strengths that I have is my ability to read
171,00:12:45.46,00:12:45.46,players. I'm just letting you know that
172,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17,I know that you're sharp. I don't know why.
173,00:12:51.25,00:12:51.25,My gut feeling tells me you're particularly sharp.
174,00:12:53.08,00:12:53.08,My conversation with Todd was deliberate.
175,00:12:55.71,00:12:55.71,"I wanted him to know that, ""Listen, I know that you're the"
176,00:12:58.50,00:12:58.50,"clever guy. Hey, I'm on to you."
177,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,"Don't come this way, and we'll be all right."""
178,00:13:04.12,00:13:04.12,">> Right now, honestly, and I mean this, is I really want to"
179,00:13:08.17,00:13:08.17,"be here. Like, I just really, really,"
180,00:13:12.21,00:13:12.21,"really want to be here, and I will do whatever to stay, you"
181,00:13:16.42,00:13:16.42,know. >> Jean-Robert was very right.
182,00:13:19.08,00:13:19.08,I will do whatever I need to do to win that million dollars.
183,00:13:23.08,00:13:23.08,"Can I ask you, though, to not tell other people you think I'm"
184,00:13:26.25,00:13:26.25,"sharp? >> I mean, I'm not saying that I"
185,00:13:34.25,00:13:34.25,"am, but I don't want to become that one."
186,00:13:36.29,00:13:36.29,"I can't have someone walking around saying, ""Watch out for"
187,00:13:38.62,00:13:38.62,"Todd."" I'm saying, ""Watch out for"
188,00:13:40.79,00:13:40.79,"Jean-Robert"" now. I'm here to win a million"
189,00:13:42.71,00:13:42.71,dollars. It's a million dollars.
190,00:13:45.25,00:13:45.25,That's a lot of money. >> We made it.
191,00:14:02.38,00:14:02.38,We got a pot. I'm so hoping we'd have a pot.
192,00:14:06.21,00:14:06.21,"What are we going to do about shelter, something for the"
193,00:14:07.92,00:14:07.92,"night? >> All right, let's start"
194,00:14:09.71,00:14:09.71,"thinking. >> When I first walked up, I"
195,00:14:12.50,00:14:12.50,"have on a dress with heels. I'm a southern girl, but I'm"
196,00:14:17.21,00:14:17.21,"not an outdoorsy girl, and this situation is so disgusting and"
197,00:14:21.25,00:14:21.25,so nasty. Camp sucks.
198,00:14:24.58,00:14:24.58,This is way harder than I expected.
199,00:14:28.92,00:14:28.92,>> Definitely build some kind of lean-to with it.
200,00:14:31.04,00:14:31.04,">> Right. >> I mean, if we can salvage any"
201,00:14:33.25,00:14:33.25,of this... >> Yeah.
202,00:14:35.04,00:14:35.04,>> It would be helpful. >> Ready?
203,00:14:36.79,00:14:36.79,"All right, good, good. Watch that big piece of wood."
204,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,It's rotting. It's... that's okay.
205,00:14:43.71,00:14:43.71,>> Let's think about this a minute.
206,00:14:45.71,00:14:45.71,"When you get that up, it ain't going to be big enough for"
207,00:14:48.17,00:14:48.17,"all of us to sleep under, even you can use that."
208,00:14:50.71,00:14:50.71,">> Okay, so what do you suggest?"
209,00:14:52.67,00:14:52.67,>> I suggest we build one. >> Okay.
210,00:14:55.46,00:14:55.46,"Well, let's build it. >> This is essentially what we,"
211,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,you know-- >> We could use the foundation
212,00:15:00.75,00:15:00.75,of the wood to build it. >> Plus we have more back there.
213,00:15:03.88,00:15:03.88,>> I've got an opinion just like everyone else.
214,00:15:06.08,00:15:06.08,Go ahead. I'm from Virginia.
215,00:15:10.00,00:15:10.00,I lived in the woods. I've got a lot of experience
216,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,over these characters. Do you think this here is going
217,00:15:16.04,00:15:16.04,"to hold up? Seriously, come on."
218,00:15:19.17,00:15:19.17,">> We have to build something. >> We have to build something,"
219,00:15:21.21,00:15:21.21,though. So let's stop being negative
220,00:15:23.25,00:15:23.25,and let's just start being proactive.
221,00:15:25.21,00:15:25.21,">> I was just giving my opinion, and nobody wanted it,"
222,00:15:28.12,00:15:28.12,"so I'm done suggesting, you know."
223,00:15:30.88,00:15:30.88,I won't do that no more. (loud noise)
224,00:15:34.21,00:15:34.21,">> Oh, God! >> I'm sorry."
225,00:15:37.12,00:15:37.12,I've got a little gas. I can't help it.
226,00:15:39.12,00:15:39.12,">> I don't mind, really. I'm around wrestlers every day"
227,00:15:40.83,00:15:40.83,of my life. >> I seriously can't believe
228,00:15:43.25,00:15:43.25,you're a wrestler. >> It's so fun.
229,00:15:46.17,00:15:46.17,It's the greatest job in the world.
230,00:15:48.42,00:15:48.42,"It's the funnest job ever. I'm a WW Diva, and I wrestle"
231,00:15:52.17,00:15:52.17,for a living. I compete.
232,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,I think that it's probably prepared me a great deal more
233,00:15:58.92,00:15:58.92,"for this game. I need to chop something up,"
234,00:16:01.21,00:16:01.21,y'all. Because there is that
235,00:16:03.21,00:16:03.21,"competitive nature you have within the locker room, and"
236,00:16:06.04,00:16:06.04,that's a great positive that I'm going to have going into this
237,00:16:09.12,00:16:09.12,game. We are going to have a really
238,00:16:11.21,00:16:11.21,awesome shelter. I don't want to go home a
239,00:16:13.58,00:16:13.58,"loser, you know what I mean? Because I know my fans are"
240,00:16:16.08,00:16:16.08,"going to want me to win. Oh, hell, no, I can't dance at"
241,00:16:19.17,00:16:19.17,all. I'm the worst.
242,00:16:23.00,00:16:23.00,"My girlfriends in the locker room, like, they always play"
243,00:16:25.25,00:16:25.25,music while we're getting ready. I'm not doing it!
244,00:16:29.50,00:16:29.50,I can't. >> I think I'm on the lazy
245,00:16:38.17,00:16:38.17,"tribe. Just seeing, like, half the"
246,00:16:40.79,00:16:40.79,people wanting to just stand around and talk about the most
247,00:16:42.88,00:16:42.88,"ridiculous stuff I'd ever heard. >> Oh, yeah."
248,00:16:45.04,00:16:45.04,>> What song? >> It don't matter.
249,00:16:47.25,00:16:47.25,>> I can't connect to the wackiness out here.
250,00:16:50.21,00:16:50.21,"Like, I mean, I could probably do it at home, but I just... I"
251,00:16:52.42,00:16:52.42,feel like so serious. >> Why can't we do the shelter
252,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,right here? Because it's much more open and
253,00:17:06.08,00:17:06.08,cleaner than up there under the trees.
254,00:17:08.25,00:17:08.25,">> Let's do it. >> Honestly, we just need to"
255,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,make a decision. >> Why am I here?!
256,00:17:27.21,00:17:27.21,">> Oh, God, please help us. (laughter)"
257,00:17:40.29,00:17:40.29,">> I need some vines. >> Is that helping, you guys?"
258,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17,">> Yeah. >> Let's get more, though."
259,00:17:47.42,00:17:47.42,">> Yeah, oh, yeah. >> Timber."
260,00:17:53.12,00:17:53.12,>> I just need a few more for the bed.
261,00:17:58.29,00:17:58.29,">> You guys are, like, regular lumbermen."
262,00:18:00.92,00:18:00.92,>> Timber! >> We're getting a lot
263,00:18:03.38,00:18:03.38,accomplished with our shelter. We are a very strong tribe.
264,00:18:06.21,00:18:06.21,"We get along great, and we work well together."
265,00:18:17.50,00:18:17.50,">> How you doing, James? >> Hey, man."
266,00:18:21.62,00:18:21.62,">> I think James is amazing. He's, like, Superman."
267,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,I've never seen... he just works.
268,00:18:28.83,00:18:28.83,But I'm worried about James because he's just been very
269,00:18:31.38,00:18:31.38,"quiet. I mean, you're an interesting"
270,00:18:33.21,00:18:33.21,guy. What do you do?
271,00:18:35.42,00:18:35.42,>> You bury people. That's interesting.
272,00:18:37.17,00:18:37.17,Are you serious? >> Yeah.
273,00:18:40.25,00:18:40.25,"Yeah, I'm a grave digger. I like that work because, you"
274,00:18:43.04,00:18:43.04,"know, I'm kind of by myself. That's part of my problem over"
275,00:18:45.21,00:18:45.21,here now. I'm used to being by myself.
276,00:18:50.25,00:18:50.25,">> You know what, charm is deceptive."
277,00:18:52.21,00:18:52.21,You be you and you'll be fine. The whole initiation of the
278,00:18:55.25,00:18:55.25,"social thing, talking and trying to strategize, that's"
279,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,"going to kill me. >> Okay, ask people questions,"
280,00:19:02.50,00:19:02.50,because they love to talk about themselves.
281,00:19:04.83,00:19:04.83,>> I'm definitely worried about the social aspect.
282,00:19:07.08,00:19:07.08,"I need to pay more attention to that, so I need to do a little"
283,00:19:09.42,00:19:09.42,"bit more hustling. Hopefully, pull out the"
284,00:19:12.42,00:19:12.42,challenges and make them love me.
285,00:19:35.21,00:19:35.21,>> The heavens unzipped on us. >> Where we put the shelter is
286,00:19:58.08,00:19:58.08,"very important, and this was, obviously, a temporary thing."
287,00:20:01.04,00:20:01.04,">> Yeah, this, obviously... >> It was a terrible idea."
288,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,>> What do y'all want to do? >> Build a shelter.
289,00:20:08.25,00:20:08.25,">> Yeah, what do you want? Here, here, up there?"
290,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,Last night was really wet. It's a reality check for these
291,00:20:16.42,00:20:16.42,guys up here. We'll try to straighten this
292,00:20:20.04,00:20:20.04,mess up a little bit. Maybe everybody will come
293,00:20:23.25,00:20:23.25,"together today, you know. >> There you go."
294,00:20:27.92,00:20:27.92,>> Yeah! >> Does someone want to find
295,00:20:34.21,00:20:34.21,stuff with me? >> What are you going to do?
296,00:20:36.42,00:20:36.42,">> I'm going to find, like, some leaves."
297,00:20:39.42,00:20:39.42,>> I think we need fronds and vines.
298,00:20:44.67,00:20:44.67,>> I'm not feeling so good. My first night was pretty rough.
299,00:20:58.21,00:20:58.21,I was soaking wet for the whole night.
300,00:21:01.33,00:21:01.33,"I think I'm pretty sick. I have chills, like, really bad."
301,00:21:08.17,00:21:08.17,"And, like, I keep dry heaving. Like I want to throw up but"
302,00:21:11.04,00:21:11.04,there's just nothing in there. >> What about Ashley?
303,00:21:16.21,00:21:16.21,She does not look good at all. >> I feel so worried for her.
304,00:21:18.46,00:21:18.46,>> I've wrestled sick before. I've wrestled with 104 fever
305,00:21:23.50,00:21:23.50,before. I have to stay in the game.
306,00:21:27.04,00:21:27.04,"I'm not leaving. Hopefully, it will pass."
307,00:21:31.17,00:21:31.17,">> I know, if you're feeling bad don't start thinking you're"
308,00:21:34.08,00:21:34.08,on the block just because of this.
309,00:21:37.88,00:21:37.88,"Okay? Ashley, I thought she'd be a"
310,00:21:40.21,00:21:40.21,"lot stronger person, considering her profession and"
311,00:21:43.25,00:21:43.25,how her demeanor is. But if Ashley's health stays
312,00:21:48.46,00:21:48.46,"the same, Ashley's going first. >> We've got some tree mail."
313,00:22:01.92,00:22:01.92,"Waa! Dude, check this out."
314,00:22:07.38,00:22:07.38,">> You guys, we got some tree mail."
315,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,">> Fei Long! >> You guys, check out how"
316,00:22:14.04,00:22:14.04,"cool, eh. >> ""The untested enemy you must"
317,00:22:19.04,00:22:19.04,face today. They may have the power to send

321,00:22:30.21,00:22:30.21,"This is immunity, obviously. >> Obviously."
322,00:22:33.12,00:22:33.12,"Game is on, huh? >> That book, Art of War, we"
323,00:22:36.00,00:22:36.00,should take a look at that probably before our challenge.
324,00:22:38.79,00:22:38.79,>> Yeah. >> All right.
325,00:22:41.04,00:22:41.04,"Chapter one, ""The commander stands for the general's"
326,00:22:43.04,00:22:43.04,"qualities of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and"

328,00:22:48.88,00:22:48.88,"need a commander, and I can't help but notice that you've"
329,00:22:52.21,00:22:52.21,kind of taken that position. We do need someone who's
330,00:22:55.42,00:22:55.42,"strong and knows how to take lead, and you're very good at"
331,00:22:58.25,00:22:58.25,"it. >> It feels weird, but, I think"
332,00:23:03.04,00:23:03.04,I can do it. >> Okay.
333,00:23:05.17,00:23:05.17,"Aaron's a very strong player. And I'm very, very smart in"
334,00:23:08.21,00:23:08.21,"trying to push the leader role more so on to Aaron, because I"
335,00:23:12.21,00:23:12.21,"don't want to take that position, but also to keep him"
336,00:23:14.92,00:23:14.92,close to me. I want him to trust me.

338,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,>> Yeah. >> Being in the leadership
339,00:23:25.25,00:23:25.25,"role, it's not someplace that I want to be."
340,00:23:27.42,00:23:27.42,But leadership is just going for it.
341,00:23:30.21,00:23:30.21,"I'm ready, but I'm nervous. >> ""With your namesake held"

345,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,">> Yes, I'm going to pull through."
346,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17,">> If it's like obstacles, I should be, probably... I'm"
347,00:23:51.67,00:23:51.67,thinking I'm probably one of the better guys.
348,00:23:53.25,00:23:53.25,"I'm small, too, so it's easy for me."
349,00:23:55.04,00:23:55.04,But climbing stuff isn't hard. I'm a parkour and free-running
350,00:23:58.92,00:23:58.92,performer. It is under control.

357,00:24:15.67,00:24:15.67,do whatever I can to get my team across the finish line
358,00:24:17.92,00:24:17.92,"first and win. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."

361,00:24:48.25,00:24:48.25,>> About as well as expected. (laughs)
362,00:24:53.08,00:24:53.08,"Overall, we're doing okay. We're okay."

373,00:25:25.42,00:25:25.42,"race ahead and scale two walls, releasing a drawbridge at each"
374,00:25:29.62,00:25:29.62,"wall. You'll then retrieve a key,"
375,00:25:33.50,00:25:33.50,"race back, unlock the gate, bring the rest of the tribe."
376,00:25:37.38,00:25:37.38,You must then make your way through a swamp to the finish

378,00:25:43.17,00:25:43.17,Each tribe member must place their pole in the correct spot.
379,00:25:47.21,00:25:47.21,The first tribe to do so wins the challenge.
380,00:25:51.46,00:25:51.46,You want to know what you're playing for?
381,00:25:53.50,00:25:53.50,">> Yes, please! >> PROBST: The single most"
382,00:25:55.58,00:25:55.58,important thing in this game is immunity.
383,00:25:58.83,00:25:58.83,This is the immunity idol. (cheers and applause)
384,00:26:02.42,00:26:02.42,"When you have this in your possession, you cannot be voted"
385,00:26:05.38,00:26:05.38,"out of this game. Winning tribe gets immunity,"
386,00:26:09.29,00:26:09.29,and winning tribe gets fire. (applause)
387,00:26:13.67,00:26:13.67,Fire in the form of flint. This will dramatically change
388,00:26:16.17,00:26:16.17,camp life. Worth playing for?
389,00:26:19.08,00:26:19.08,">> Yes. >> PROBST: One more thing, you"
390,00:26:21.08,00:26:21.08,were given your running shoes for this challenge.
391,00:26:23.25,00:26:23.25,You can take them back to camp with you.
392,00:26:25.58,00:26:25.58,(applause) Take your spots.
393,00:26:28.67,00:26:28.67,We'll get started. Here we go.
394,00:26:35.46,00:26:35.46,It is the first challenge of Survivor: China.
395,00:26:39.08,00:26:39.08,At the head of the dragon and retrieving the key for Fei Long
396,00:26:41.79,00:26:41.79,is James. At the head of the tiger for
397,00:26:44.21,00:26:44.21,"Zhan Hu, Frosti. For immunity and fire,"
398,00:26:47.88,00:26:47.88,survivors ready? Go!
399,00:26:59.42,00:26:59.42,Denise falls for Fei Long. Zhan Hu trying to figure it out.
400,00:27:06.46,00:27:06.46,We're dead even early on. The tribe that works together
401,00:27:12.83,00:27:12.83,the best will win this challenge.
402,00:27:17.79,00:27:17.79,Still dead even going up the first platforms.
403,00:27:22.92,00:27:22.92,Fei Long in the lead with the red dragon.
404,00:27:26.04,00:27:26.04,>> Up top. >> PROBST: Zhan Hu slow going
405,00:27:30.08,00:27:30.08,with the yellow tiger. Fei Long with a bit of a lead.
406,00:27:37.92,00:27:37.92,James got to unclip. James having trouble getting
407,00:27:42.21,00:27:42.21,unclipped. Zhan Hu is catching up.
408,00:27:46.29,00:27:46.29,">> Go, go! >> PROBST: Frosti is now"
409,00:27:49.71,00:27:49.71,unclipped. So is James.
410,00:27:58.38,00:27:58.38,Both guys leap the first wall. Frosti forgot to lower his
411,00:28:02.38,00:28:02.38,drawbridge. He lost some time.
412,00:28:11.58,00:28:11.58,James now with a bit of a lead for Fei Long.
413,00:28:14.04,00:28:14.04,Frosti right behind. Got to unlock the gate and then
414,00:28:17.25,00:28:17.25,clip back in. James has his lock open.
415,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17,Frosti got it open. Both are clipping in.
416,00:28:26.50,00:28:26.50,You've got to get clipped in. We are neck and neck again.
417,00:28:45.42,00:28:45.42,Neck and neck going into the swamp.
418,00:28:48.25,00:28:48.25,Got to stick together. Zhan Hu struggling with the
419,00:28:52.92,00:28:52.92,yellow tiger. Fei Long taking that red dragon
420,00:29:02.25,00:29:02.25,in the lead. Fei Long first to the finish
421,00:29:06.58,00:29:06.58,platform. Zhan Hu falling behind.
422,00:29:15.67,00:29:15.67,Zhan Hu now to the finish platform.
423,00:29:20.21,00:29:20.21,>> Over here! >> PROBST: You've got to put
424,00:29:23.00,00:29:23.00,your poles in the correct order. They go in one way and only one
425,00:29:25.08,00:29:25.08,way. Fei Long with some progress.
426,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,Zhan Hu getting nowhere with the puzzle.
427,00:29:38.21,00:29:38.21,Fei Long thinks they have it. Fei Long wins immunity and fire!
428,00:29:48.58,00:29:48.58,>> Woo-hoo! >> Yeah!
429,00:29:52.92,00:29:52.92,"Way to go, baby. >> PROBST: Fei Long, immunity."
430,00:30:04.50,00:30:04.50,>> Yeah! (applause)
431,00:30:07.42,00:30:07.42,>> PROBST: Nobody going home tonight.
432,00:30:10.25,00:30:10.25,Denise wants the flint. There's your fire.
433,00:30:14.25,00:30:14.25,"Zhan Hu, you've got a date with me, tribal council tonight,"
434,00:30:17.83,00:30:17.83,where one of the eight of you will earn the distinction of
435,00:30:21.25,00:30:21.25,being the first person voted out of Survivor: China.
436,00:30:25.08,00:30:25.08,You have the afternoon to figure it out.
437,00:30:27.04,00:30:27.04,See you at tribal. >> I need to air out my shoes.
438,00:30:45.04,00:30:45.04,>> Full of mud. >> I need to go have a seat down
439,00:30:49.08,00:30:49.08,"there. >> Have a seat, take a break."
440,00:30:51.21,00:30:51.21,You need five minutes? Do what you got to do.
441,00:30:53.25,00:30:53.25,">> I need, like, more than that. >> Take... hey, hey."
442,00:30:56.08,00:30:56.08,Let it all out. Don't care if you cry.
443,00:30:58.58,00:30:58.58,"Bawl your little head off, okay. Don't sweat it."
444,00:31:02.92,00:31:02.92,"As I see it right now, we are all still a complete tribe."
445,00:31:07.08,00:31:07.08,"I'd like to see us function as such, pretty please."
446,00:31:10.29,00:31:10.29,We have unfortunate business to do tonight.
447,00:31:13.00,00:31:13.00,It sucks. It is a fact of life.
448,00:31:15.38,00:31:15.38,">> We need to all, like, really pitch in at camp because I just"
449,00:31:18.08,00:31:18.08,"feel like, I know everybody is doing stuff, and I just feel"
450,00:31:21.04,00:31:21.04,"like there's so much to do. And it just sucks... like, it"
451,00:31:24.08,00:31:24.08,"sucks to know that, you know. >> We are not going to win any"
452,00:31:27.21,00:31:27.21,"challenges if we don't have, like, a decent shelter."
453,00:31:30.67,00:31:30.67,>> It is hard out here. More so than I ever imagined.
454,00:31:34.04,00:31:34.04,And I'm trying to get through it without being down about it.
455,00:31:37.08,00:31:37.08,We have to do two crossbeams under like this.
456,00:31:40.25,00:31:40.25,We need two more of these things.
457,00:31:42.04,00:31:42.04,What do you think is the best way?
458,00:31:44.25,00:31:44.25,Do you think do it the same way is the best way?
459,00:31:46.42,00:31:46.42,>> You need to get everybody's opinion.
460,00:31:48.17,00:31:48.17,>> I'm asking your opinion. >> I agree with you.
461,00:31:51.17,00:31:51.17,>> I wasn't stating my opinion. I was asking yours.
462,00:31:53.62,00:31:53.62,>> I agree with you. That'll work.
463,00:31:56.38,00:31:56.38,">> But I just, I say the two options."
464,00:31:59.46,00:31:59.46,So which one do you think is better in your opinion?
465,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,>> I would put two more pieces down like you said.
466,00:32:04.38,00:32:04.38,">> I know you want to put two more pieces, but how?"
467,00:32:07.67,00:32:07.67,Chicken won't give an opinion on how he thinks anything
468,00:32:10.12,00:32:10.12,should be done. It's not worth anything to me
469,00:32:12.21,00:32:12.21,if he chooses not to apply his strength.
470,00:32:15.62,00:32:15.62,"We're going to try to keep the instruments, if they're not in"
471,00:32:17.38,00:32:17.38,"use just in one area so everybody knows where they are,"
472,00:32:20.58,00:32:20.58,"and, like, they don't get lost. >> Peih-gee, all of a sudden,"
473,00:32:25.00,00:32:25.00,she's sort of barking out orders and trying to step into
474,00:32:27.62,00:32:27.62,this leadership position. >> Take these two jugs and pour
475,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,them out into that big thing. >> All righty.
476,00:32:33.58,00:32:33.58,">> If you're going to do that, then you shouldn't be crying"
477,00:32:35.46,00:32:35.46,"after challenges. You know, that's not a leader"
478,00:32:37.42,00:32:37.42,role. I know we have to work and
479,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,"everything, but we still have to think what we're going to do"
480,00:32:44.04,00:32:44.04,at tribal council. >> I would hope to think I'm
481,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,not going to be voted out by anybody because I'm not sick at
482,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,all. I feel a million times better
483,00:32:54.42,00:32:54.42,than I did before. I see what can do.
484,00:32:58.12,00:32:58.12,I would hate to think one day of being sick would dominate
485,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,over everything. >> She was sick yesterday.
486,00:33:09.25,00:33:09.25,So.... >> That's not the point.
487,00:33:11.38,00:33:11.38,>> That's true. >> I didn't ask if she was sick.
488,00:33:13.38,00:33:13.38,I just asked you what she done yesterday.
489,00:33:16.12,00:33:16.12,"Whether (inaudible), whether you fell down the bank and sprained"
490,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,"you ankle, or you got a damn headache, or whatever, it's an"
491,00:33:22.08,00:33:22.08,ailment that can take you out of the game.
492,00:33:24.21,00:33:24.21,"It's just that, you know... it's just that simple."
493,00:33:29.00,00:33:29.00,I feel like Ashley's gone. That's what I'm writing down
494,00:33:31.29,00:33:31.29,tonight. She ain't done nothing since
495,00:33:33.79,00:33:33.79,she's landed down here. What are you doing?
496,00:33:36.08,00:33:36.08,You don't know? >> I need to figure stuff out.
497,00:33:39.21,00:33:39.21,">> Whatever happens, happens. You know, I don't even know if"
498,00:33:42.21,00:33:42.21,"I'm 100% safe tonight, you know, for whatever reason."
499,00:33:45.12,00:33:45.12,That's what makes the element of the game.
500,00:34:03.00,00:34:03.00,">> I think the heads on the block tonight are Chicken,"
501,00:34:05.25,00:34:05.25,"Ashley, and Peih-gee. Chicken, I, you know, we're the"
502,00:34:09.42,00:34:09.42,two oldest guys. And I've got nothing against
503,00:34:12.92,00:34:12.92,"youth, but, you know in this kind of environment situation,"
504,00:34:15.71,00:34:15.71,I would prefer to have a little more experience in our tribe
505,00:34:18.71,00:34:18.71,right now. I don't wish anybody bad here.
506,00:34:26.21,00:34:26.21,But I want our tribe to be strong.
507,00:34:29.08,00:34:29.08,And it's time to make stuff happen.
508,00:35:06.21,00:35:06.21,>> PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch.
509,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,Go ahead and grab a torch. Approach the flame.
510,00:35:11.04,00:35:11.04,This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this
511,00:35:14.79,00:35:14.79,"game fire represents your life. As long as you have fire, still"
512,00:35:21.25,00:35:21.25,"in the game; when your fire's gone, so are you."
513,00:35:27.58,00:35:27.58,Let's talk about the first few days.
514,00:35:30.79,00:35:30.79,"Peih-gee, was this more than you bargained for?"
515,00:35:34.00,00:35:34.00,">> You know, I came in here thinking this was a piece of"
516,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,"cake, but it is mud everywhere. Trying to build a shelter is"
517,00:35:40.46,00:35:40.46,hard because you don't have the right implements.
518,00:35:44.04,00:35:44.04,">> PROBST: Chicken, you held up two fingers."
519,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,>> It took us two days to do that.
520,00:35:48.21,00:35:48.21,We should have had it by dark the first day.
521,00:35:50.88,00:35:50.88,">> PROBST: Did you try to become the leader and say, ""Hey, let's"
522,00:35:53.00,00:35:53.00,"go, guys."" >> I'm not grabbing the bull by"
523,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,"the horns and done that, no, I haven't."
524,00:35:58.25,00:35:58.25,But I guess somebody's going to have to before we come together.
525,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,That's what's going to have to be done.
526,00:36:04.08,00:36:04.08,>> PROBST: Show of hands-- anybody here willing to say
527,00:36:06.67,00:36:06.67,"right now, ""I will step up and be the leader of this tribe?"""
528,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,"Well, you've got two, one man, one woman."
529,00:36:14.71,00:36:14.71,>> We don't have time to mess around.
530,00:36:17.25,00:36:17.25,I did not want to step in to this position at all.
531,00:36:20.58,00:36:20.58,And you know what? If I don't step up and kick
532,00:36:22.92,00:36:22.92,"someone in the butt to do something, I don't know what's"
533,00:36:25.08,00:36:25.08,"going to happen, but I will step up and do what I can to"
534,00:36:29.12,00:36:29.12,help get this tribe together and proficient and then focus
535,00:36:33.17,00:36:33.17,"on the challenges at hand, and hopefully get it really nice"
536,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,"and tight. >> PROBST: Peih-gee, you put"
537,00:36:38.42,00:36:38.42,your hand up. What would you bring as a
538,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,leader? >> It is hard because you don't
539,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,want to be bossy. These are grown people and I
540,00:36:44.88,00:36:44.88,don't want to be sitting around trying to tell people what to
541,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,"do, but on the other hand, somebody has to kind of do it"
542,00:36:49.71,00:36:49.71,if it's not happening naturally. If you're just floundering
543,00:36:52.38,00:36:52.38,"around, you're going to die out here."
544,00:36:56.08,00:36:56.08,">> PROBST: So, did you guys just make a decision, your first"
545,00:36:58.25,00:36:58.25,tribe decision? >> Yes!
546,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,">> PROBST: But after tonight's tribal council, there will only"
547,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,"be seven people left, so you're probably wise to always be a"
548,00:37:06.58,00:37:06.58,"little concerned. Okay, so made a little progress"
549,00:37:10.08,00:37:10.08,as a tribe. Now you have to make your first
550,00:37:14.00,00:37:14.00,big decision. Who do you get rid of?
551,00:37:17.08,00:37:17.08,"Dave, what does this tribe need to do with tonight's vote to"
552,00:37:19.71,00:37:19.71,make it a better tribe? >> Trying to trim the
553,00:37:24.17,00:37:24.17,least-productive people out of it.
554,00:37:28.04,00:37:28.04,">> PROBST: Chicken, what are you going to base your vote on"
555,00:37:30.29,00:37:30.29,tonight? >> I'll base my vote on tonight
556,00:37:34.04,00:37:34.04,the person who has done the least in the last three days.
557,00:37:37.04,00:37:37.04,"It's just cut and dried. >> PROBST: Erik, how important"
558,00:37:40.25,00:37:40.25,is it whether somebody is pulling their weight or not
559,00:37:42.25,00:37:42.25,pulling their weight? >> I think contributions is
560,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,"huge. I mean, especially now that"
561,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50,we've realized how long it takes to build a shelter.
562,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,And so I think we're going to really have to hold each other
563,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,"accountable. >> PROBST: Ashley, think you're"
564,00:37:54.08,00:37:54.08,fitting in with this group? >> I did for a while.
565,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,"And I mean, now that I'm hearing everybody speak freely,"
566,00:38:00.21,00:38:00.21,"I kind of feel like that if you broke it down per day, I was"
567,00:38:04.08,00:38:04.08,"throwing up, I was laying on the ground."
568,00:38:06.50,00:38:06.50,I pretty much was feeling like I was going to die.
569,00:38:09.21,00:38:09.21,"And I guess if you put that in the equation, then I would"
570,00:38:12.79,00:38:12.79,have technically been the one who has done the least amount
571,00:38:14.79,00:38:14.79,of work. I don't feel like I should be
572,00:38:16.58,00:38:16.58,judged on that. >> PROBST: So you're feeling a
573,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,little uneasy. >> Right now I am because I
574,00:38:20.62,00:38:20.62,"hear how they're talking. >> PROBST: Chicken, how do you"
575,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,think you're fitting? >> I don't fit in.
576,00:38:28.00,00:38:28.00,"You know, I don't. But, I'm not the one that's"
577,00:38:30.17,00:38:30.17,"done the least amount of work, and you're out there in the"
578,00:38:34.92,00:38:34.92,middle of a jungle. You ain't got nothing.
579,00:38:38.08,00:38:38.08,So do you want the guy that don't fit in or do you want the
580,00:38:42.42,00:38:42.42,"guy that works? You know, if we don't open our"
581,00:38:46.08,00:38:46.08,"eyes, we going to be seeing you a lot."
582,00:38:51.08,00:38:51.08,">> PROBST: Okay, so, it sounds like you have a plan to have"
583,00:38:54.08,00:38:54.08,leadership in your tribe. Now you have to make the first
584,00:38:56.88,00:38:56.88,big decision-- who to get rid of.
585,00:38:58.88,00:38:58.88,"It is time to vote. Frosti, you're up."
586,00:39:19.04,00:39:19.04,>> I'm voting for Peih-gee because I feel like the group
587,00:39:22.04,00:39:22.04,"already has a leader, and that's Dave."
588,00:39:38.71,00:39:38.71,">> Just bad luck. Wrong time, wrong place."
589,00:39:55.25,00:39:55.25,">> Chicken, I think you've truly lived up to your"
590,00:39:57.58,00:39:57.58,nickname. You've been too afraid to step
591,00:39:59.67,00:39:59.67,"up to anything, and we don't need that right now."
592,00:40:08.83,00:40:08.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
593,00:40:20.04,00:40:20.04,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
594,00:40:22.04,00:40:22.04,The person voted out will be asked to leave the council area
595,00:40:24.42,00:40:24.42,immediately. I'll read the votes.
596,00:40:28.00,00:40:28.00,"First vote, Chicken. Ashley."
597,00:40:36.88,00:40:36.88,"Ashley. Two votes Ashley, one vote"
598,00:40:40.42,00:40:40.42,Chicken. Peih-gee.
599,00:40:46.21,00:40:46.21,"Chicken. There's two votes Chicken, two"
600,00:40:50.12,00:40:50.12,"vote Ashley, one vote Peih-gee. Chicken."
601,00:40:55.46,00:40:55.46,"There's three votes Chicken, two votes Ashley, one vote"
602,00:40:58.25,00:40:58.25,Peih-gee. First person voted out of
603,00:41:03.08,00:41:03.08,Survivor: China-- Chicken. >> Damn!
604,00:41:06.62,00:41:06.62,>> PROBST: That's four. That's enough.
605,00:41:08.62,00:41:08.62,"You need to bring me your torch. Chicken, the tribe has spoken."
606,00:41:19.04,00:41:19.04,>> I heard 'em. >> PROBST: Time for you to go.
607,00:41:37.46,00:41:37.46,"Well, if there's one good thing about coming to tribal council"
608,00:41:39.71,00:41:39.71,"tonight, you will go back to camp with your torches, which"
609,00:41:42.83,00:41:42.83,"means you will have fire. >> Oh, my gosh!"
610,00:41:47.21,00:41:47.21,>> PROBST: Here's flint. >> Yes!
611,00:41:50.04,00:41:50.04,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: Grab your torches."
612,00:41:52.08,00:41:52.08,Head back to camp. Good night.
613,00:42:05.21,00:42:05.21,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
614,00:42:09.25,00:42:09.25,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
615,00:42:11.29,00:42:11.29,"At Fei Long, the poker player's bluff is called."
616,00:42:14.04,00:42:14.04,">> Jean-Robert, you need to start pulling your weight."
617,00:42:16.17,00:42:16.17,>> Why don't we all rest? >> PROBST: Dave takes command
618,00:42:19.50,00:42:19.50,at Zhan Hu. >> You're the leader and I'll
619,00:42:22.12,00:42:22.12,let you do what you want. >> How many fires have you
620,00:42:24.04,00:42:24.04,"built, sweetheart? If she want to fight, I can"
621,00:42:25.62,00:42:25.62,give her a fight. >> PROBST: And the pro wrestler
622,00:42:27.25,00:42:27.25,comes out in Ashley.  Captioning sponsored by

625,00:42:33.17,00:42:33.17,access.wgbh.org >> It was kind of a shock that
626,00:42:36.50,00:42:36.50,"the young group didn't come together, and I don't think"
627,00:42:39.50,00:42:39.50,they ever will. They're just playing by the
628,00:42:41.21,00:42:41.21,seat of their pants. I put a lot of thought going
629,00:42:43.83,00:42:43.83,into it but I never got nowhere. There's no one more proud to be
630,00:42:47.04,00:42:47.04,such a small part of one big adventure.
631,00:42:50.38,00:42:50.38,It was truly an honor to be here.
632,00:42:52.71,00:42:52.71,Without a doubt.
