196,00:14:21.25,00:14:21.25,so nasty.Camp sucks.
197,00:14:24.58,00:14:24.58,This is way harder than Iexpected.
198,00:14:28.92,00:14:28.92,>> Definitely build some kindof lean-to with it.

202,00:14:36.79,00:14:36.79,"All right, good, good.Watch that big piece of wood."
203,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,It's rotting.It's... that's okay.
204,00:14:43.71,00:14:43.71,>> Let's think about this aminute.
205,00:14:45.71,00:14:45.71,"When you get that up, itain't going to be big enough for"
206,00:14:48.17,00:14:48.17,"all of us to sleep under, evenyou can use that."
207,00:14:50.71,00:14:50.71,">> Okay, so what do yousuggest?"
208,00:14:52.67,00:14:52.67,>> I suggest we build one.>> Okay.
209,00:14:55.46,00:14:55.46,"Well, let's build it.>> This is essentially what we,"
210,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,you know-->> We could use the foundation
211,00:15:00.75,00:15:00.75,of the wood to build it.>> Plus we have more back there.
212,00:15:03.88,00:15:03.88,>> I've got an opinion justlike everyone else.
213,00:15:06.08,00:15:06.08,Go ahead.I'm from Virginia.
214,00:15:10.00,00:15:10.00,I lived in the woods.I've got a lot of experience
215,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,over these characters.Do you think this here is going

217,00:15:19.17,00:15:19.17,">> We have to build something.>> We have to build something,"
218,00:15:21.21,00:15:21.21,though.So let's stop being negative
219,00:15:23.25,00:15:23.25,and let's just start beingproactive.
220,00:15:25.21,00:15:25.21,">> I was just giving myopinion, and nobody wanted it,"
221,00:15:28.12,00:15:28.12,"so I'm done suggesting, youknow."

230,00:15:52.17,00:15:52.17,for a living.I compete.
231,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,I think that it's probablyprepared me a great deal more

233,00:16:01.21,00:16:01.21,y'all.Because there is that

235,00:16:06.04,00:16:06.04,that's a great positive that I'mgoing to have going into this
236,00:16:09.12,00:16:09.12,game.We are going to have a really
237,00:16:11.21,00:16:11.21,awesome shelter.I don't want to go home a
238,00:16:13.58,00:16:13.58,"loser, you know what I mean?Because I know my fans are"
239,00:16:16.08,00:16:16.08,"going to want me to win.Oh, hell, no, I can't dance at"
240,00:16:19.17,00:16:19.17,all.I'm the worst.
241,00:16:23.00,00:16:23.00,"My girlfriends in the lockerroom, like, they always play"
242,00:16:25.25,00:16:25.25,music while we're getting ready.I'm not doing it!
243,00:16:29.50,00:16:29.50,I can't.>> I think I'm on the lazy
244,00:16:38.17,00:16:38.17,"tribe.Just seeing, like, half the"
245,00:16:40.79,00:16:40.79,people wanting to just standaround and talk about the most

250,00:16:52.42,00:16:52.42,feel like so serious.>> Why can't we do the shelter
251,00:17:04.04,00:17:04.04,right here?Because it's much more open and
252,00:17:06.08,00:17:06.08,cleaner than up there under thetrees.
253,00:17:08.25,00:17:08.25,">> Let's do it.>> Honestly, we just need to"
254,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,make a decision.>> Why am I here?!

267,00:18:28.83,00:18:28.83,But I'm worried about Jamesbecause he's just been very

272,00:18:40.25,00:18:40.25,"Yeah, I'm a grave digger.I like that work because, you"
273,00:18:43.04,00:18:43.04,"know, I'm kind of by myself.That's part of my problem over"
274,00:18:45.21,00:18:45.21,here now.I'm used to being by myself.

278,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,"going to kill me.>> Okay, ask people questions,"
279,00:19:02.50,00:19:02.50,because they love to talk aboutthemselves.
280,00:19:04.83,00:19:04.83,>> I'm definitely worried aboutthe social aspect.
281,00:19:07.08,00:19:07.08,"I need to pay more attention tothat, so I need to do a little"

284,00:19:35.21,00:19:35.21,>> The heavens unzipped on us.>> Where we put the shelter is
285,00:19:58.08,00:19:58.08,"very important, and this was,obviously, a temporary thing."
286,00:20:01.04,00:20:01.04,">> Yeah, this, obviously...>> It was a terrible idea."
287,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,>> What do y'all want to do?>> Build a shelter.

455,00:31:40.25,00:31:40.25,We need two more of thesethings.

467,00:32:10.12,00:32:10.12,should be done.It's not worth anything to me
468,00:32:12.21,00:32:12.21,if he chooses not to apply hisstrength.
469,00:32:15.62,00:32:15.62,"We're going to try to keep theinstruments, if they're not in"
470,00:32:17.38,00:32:17.38,"use just in one area soeverybody knows where they are,"
471,00:32:20.58,00:32:20.58,"and, like, they don't get lost.>> Peih-gee, all of a sudden,"
472,00:32:25.00,00:32:25.00,she's sort of barking outorders and trying to step into
473,00:32:27.62,00:32:27.62,this leadership position.>> Take these two jugs and pour
474,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,them out into that big thing.>> All righty.
475,00:32:33.58,00:32:33.58,">> If you're going to do that,then you shouldn't be crying"
476,00:32:35.46,00:32:35.46,"after challenges.You know, that's not a leader"
477,00:32:37.42,00:32:37.42,role.I know we have to work and
478,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,"everything, but we still haveto think what we're going to do"
479,00:32:44.04,00:32:44.04,at tribal council.>> I would hope to think I'm
480,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,not going to be voted out byanybody because I'm not sick at
481,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,all.I feel a million times better
482,00:32:54.42,00:32:54.42,than I did before.I see what can do.
483,00:32:58.12,00:32:58.12,I would hate to think one dayof being sick would dominate
484,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,over everything.>> She was sick yesterday.
485,00:33:09.25,00:33:09.25,So....>> That's not the point.
486,00:33:11.38,00:33:11.38,>> That's true.>> I didn't ask if she was sick.
487,00:33:13.38,00:33:13.38,I just asked you what she doneyesterday.
488,00:33:16.12,00:33:16.12,"Whether (inaudible), whether youfell down the bank and sprained"
489,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,"you ankle, or you got a damnheadache, or whatever, it's an"
490,00:33:22.08,00:33:22.08,ailment that can take you out ofthe game.
491,00:33:24.21,00:33:24.21,"It's just that, you know... it'sjust that simple."
492,00:33:29.00,00:33:29.00,I feel like Ashley's gone.That's what I'm writing down
493,00:33:31.29,00:33:31.29,tonight.She ain't done nothing since
494,00:33:33.79,00:33:33.79,she's landed down here.What are you doing?
495,00:33:36.08,00:33:36.08,You don't know?>> I need to figure stuff out.
496,00:33:39.21,00:33:39.21,">> Whatever happens, happens.You know, I don't even know if"
497,00:33:42.21,00:33:42.21,"I'm 100% safe tonight, youknow, for whatever reason."
498,00:33:45.12,00:33:45.12,That's what makes the elementof the game.
499,00:34:03.00,00:34:03.00,">> I think the heads on theblock tonight are Chicken,"
500,00:34:05.25,00:34:05.25,"Ashley, and Peih-gee.Chicken, I, you know, we're the"

503,00:34:15.71,00:34:15.71,I would prefer to have a littlemore experience in our tribe
504,00:34:18.71,00:34:18.71,right now.I don't wish anybody bad here.
505,00:34:26.21,00:34:26.21,But I want our tribe to bestrong.
506,00:34:29.08,00:34:29.08,And it's time to make stuffhappen.

508,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,Go ahead and grab a torch.Approach the flame.
509,00:35:11.04,00:35:11.04,This is part of the ritual oftribal council because in this

511,00:35:21.25,00:35:21.25,"in the game; when your fire'sgone, so are you."
512,00:35:27.58,00:35:27.58,Let's talk about the first fewdays.
513,00:35:30.79,00:35:30.79,"Peih-gee, was this more thanyou bargained for?"
514,00:35:34.00,00:35:34.00,">> You know, I came in herethinking this was a piece of"
515,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,"cake, but it is mud everywhere.Trying to build a shelter is"
516,00:35:40.46,00:35:40.46,hard because you don't have theright implements.
517,00:35:44.04,00:35:44.04,">> PROBST: Chicken, you held uptwo fingers."
518,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,>> It took us two days to dothat.
