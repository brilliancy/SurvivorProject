14,00:00:25.58,00:00:25.58,"BUT AS LONG AS I KEEP SASH CLOSE,"
15,00:00:28.08,00:00:28.08,I THINK I'LL BE FINE.
16,00:00:29.17,00:00:29.17,>> Jeff: THE SASH TRAIN WAS IN PERFECT POSITION
17,00:00:31.08,00:00:31.08,TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

20,00:00:37.25,00:00:37.25,FIRST NAONKA GAVE HER IDOL TO CHASE.
21,00:00:39.92,00:00:39.92,>> I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION TOO MUCH ABOUT MY IDOL.
22,00:00:42.04,00:00:42.04,"I'M JUST GOING TO KIND OF LAY LOW,"
23,00:00:43.42,00:00:43.42,BUT I'M NOT PLANNING ON PLAYING IT.

41,00:01:22.17,00:01:22.17,>> AND THEN THERE WERE SEVEN.
42,00:01:24.75,00:01:24.75,>> YEAH.
43,00:01:26.08,00:01:26.08,>> THERE'S THE FIRE.
44,00:01:27.29,00:01:27.29,"IF WE CAN GET THAT STARTED,"
45,00:01:28.83,00:01:28.83,YOU GUYS CAN SEE.
46,00:01:30.08,00:01:30.08,WE HAVE TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL
47,00:01:32.67,00:01:32.67,"BECAUSE OF THEM,"
48,00:01:34.00,00:01:34.00,SIT THERE AND GET WET

50,00:01:37.08,00:01:37.08,AND THEY'RE ALL DRY.
51,00:01:38.75,00:01:38.75,"TONIGHT WE HAD A TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
52,00:01:41.00,00:01:41.00,AND NAONKA AND KELLY
53,00:01:44.12,00:01:44.12,DECIDED TO QUIT.
54,00:01:46.54,00:01:46.54,20 PEOPLE OUT OF HOW MANY PEOPLE
55,00:01:50.46,00:01:50.46,"ARE GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY,"
56,00:01:52.08,00:01:52.08,"AND 11 DAYS LEFT,"
57,00:01:54.21,00:01:54.21,AND THEY WALK OUT.
58,00:01:55.88,00:01:55.88,UNBELIEVABLE.
59,00:01:58.88,00:01:58.88,>> IS THERE AN EGG TODAY?
60,00:02:00.17,00:02:00.17,>> NO.
61,00:02:01.83,00:02:01.83,>> HAVE WE GIVEN HER NAME YET?
62,00:02:03.67,00:02:03.67,>> WE SHOULD NAME HER...
63,00:02:04.88,00:02:04.88,KELLY-NAY.
64,00:02:07.29,00:02:07.29,'CAUSE THEY'RE BOTH CHICKEN.
65,00:02:09.29,00:02:09.29,>> WE'LL HAVE TO BRING THAT UP AT TRIBAL.
66,00:02:12.17,00:02:12.17,"WE NAMED OUR CHICKEN KELLY-NAY,"
67,00:02:14.62,00:02:14.62,AFTER YOU CHICKENS.
68,00:02:19.54,00:02:19.54,">> FOR EVERYONE IN THE TRIBE,"
69,00:02:22.58,00:02:22.58,LOSING TWO WAS A HUGE PLUS.
70,00:02:24.00,00:02:24.00,PROBABLY THE PERSON THAT DID NOT BENEFIT THE MOST
71,00:02:27.67,00:02:27.67,"WAS ME BECAUSE CHASE,"
72,00:02:30.17,00:02:30.17,"HE'S ALIGNED TIGHTLY WITH HOLLY AND JANE,"
73,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17,AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM
74,00:02:36.29,00:02:36.29,"IS DAN, FABIO AND BENRY,"
75,00:02:39.04,00:02:39.04,WHO HAVE ALSO FORMED A CLOSE ALLIANCE.
76,00:02:41.33,00:02:41.33,"NOW, I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL,"
77,00:02:44.62,00:02:44.62,SO I STILL THINK THE ODDS ARE IN MY FAVOR
78,00:02:47.29,00:02:47.29,"TO TRY AND MAKE A RUN FOR IT,"
79,00:02:49.04,00:02:49.04,BUT IT'S GONNA BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN WHAT I THOUGHT.
80,00:03:11.25,00:03:11.25,">> YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY WHAT I'M SAYING"
81,00:03:12.62,00:03:12.62,"IS THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
82,00:03:14.12,00:03:14.12,I'M DEFINITELY PLAYING THE IDOL.
83,00:03:15.71,00:03:15.71,I THINK THE IDOL RIGHT NOW
84,00:03:17.33,00:03:17.33,MAY BE PUTTING TARGET ON MY BACK.
85,00:03:18.92,00:03:18.92,SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO
86,00:03:20.29,00:03:20.29,IS JUST GET RID OF IT
87,00:03:22.25,00:03:22.25,AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL SHOW EVERYONE
88,00:03:24.21,00:03:24.21,I'M KIND OF LIKE A FREE AGENT
89,00:03:25.83,00:03:25.83,AND WHOEVER WANTS MY VOTE
90,00:03:28.25,00:03:28.25,"TO TRY AND GET THEM FURTHER,"
91,00:03:29.92,00:03:29.92,IT'S KIND OF UP FOR GRABS
92,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,"BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT,"
93,00:03:33.29,00:03:33.29,"YOU KNOW, WHAT THEIR END GAME IS,"
94,00:03:34.50,00:03:34.50,BUT I THINK IT'S THE SAFEST MOVE
95,00:03:36.33,00:03:36.33,"FOR ME, PERSONALLY, TO JUST PLAY IT RIGHT NOW."
96,00:03:38.62,00:03:38.62,GET RID OF IT.
97,00:03:39.79,00:03:39.79,"I'M NO LONGER A THREAT TO THE FUTURE,"
98,00:03:41.38,00:03:41.38,AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL KEEP ME AROUND LONGER.
99,00:03:42.92,00:03:42.92,>> MAKES SENSE.
100,00:03:43.92,00:03:43.92,>> I JUST WANT TO BE UP FRONT.
101,00:03:45.29,00:03:45.29,RIGHT NOW IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL GAME.
102,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,SO I REALLY HAVE TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.
103,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,I'M A SWING VOTE.
104,00:03:51.00,00:03:51.00,"NO MATTER WHO I ALIGN WITH,"
105,00:03:53.29,00:03:53.29,"I KNOW I'M GOING TO BE THE NUMBER-FOUR MAN,"
106,00:03:55.62,00:03:55.62,"SO PRETTY MUCH MAKE ME YOUR BEST OFFER,"
107,00:03:58.25,00:03:58.25,AND I'LL DECIDE THEN.
108,00:04:00.29,00:04:00.29,">> MY THING IS,"
109,00:04:01.58,00:04:01.58,"AND I'VE SAID IT FROM THE BEGINNING,"
110,00:04:03.38,00:04:03.38,"I WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH PEOPLE THAT I TRUST,"
111,00:04:05.54,00:04:05.54,AND I DID THAT.
112,00:04:06.75,00:04:06.75,"YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE THAT WITH YOU."
113,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,I'VE DONE THAT WITH BRENDA.
114,00:04:09.29,00:04:09.29,UNFORTUNATELY WE COULDN'T KEEP BRENDA IN THE GAME.
115,00:04:10.88,00:04:10.88,WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.
116,00:04:12.12,00:04:12.12,I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY IN OUR BEST INTEREST
117,00:04:13.58,00:04:13.58,"TO GO WITH THE WOMEN, ABSOLUTELY."
118,00:04:15.12,00:04:15.12,>> RIGHT.
119,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,"AND, YOU KNOW, THEN,"
120,00:04:18.21,00:04:18.21,"YOU KNOW, IDEALLY IT COMES DOWN"
121,00:04:20.29,00:04:20.29,"TO FOUR OF US,"
122,00:04:21.88,00:04:21.88,AND I THINK THE ONLY PERSON
123,00:04:24.12,00:04:24.12,THAT COULD BEAT YOU AT THE END IS JANE.
124,00:04:29.92,00:04:29.92,"IF BY SOME REASON,"
125,00:04:31.58,00:04:31.58,"JANE MAKES IT TO THE END,"
126,00:04:33.96,00:04:33.96,"YOU STILL TAKE ME, THOUGH, RIGHT?"
127,00:04:34.96,00:04:34.96,">> OH, YEAH."
128,00:04:35.96,00:04:35.96,">> YEAH, OKAY."
129,00:04:36.96,00:04:36.96,I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
130,00:04:38.38,00:04:38.38,">> ANOTHER THING THAT YOU'RE LUCKY ABOUT RIGHT NOW,"
131,00:04:41.54,00:04:41.54,YOU AND HOLLY WILL ABSOLUTELY
132,00:04:43.33,00:04:43.33,"BE GOING ON SOME SICK REWARDS, SO YOU KNOW."
133,00:04:45.12,00:04:45.12,>> I HOPE SO.
134,00:04:46.29,00:04:46.29,">> YOU WILL, 'CAUSE YOU MISSED OUT YESTERDAY."
135,00:04:48.38,00:04:48.38,SHE DEFINITELY WILL GO ON THE NEXT ONE.
136,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,">> OH, YEAH, I MEAN,"
137,00:04:51.92,00:04:51.92,"MY THING IS IF ANYONE WINS NEXT,"
138,00:04:55.33,00:04:55.33,I THINK THEY SHOULD TAKE HOLLY
139,00:04:56.75,00:04:56.75,BECAUSE SHE DESERVES IT THE MOST.
140,00:04:57.96,00:04:57.96,>> I THINK YOU ARE NEXT IN LINE FOR THE REWARDS.
141,00:05:00.92,00:05:00.92,">> WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT."
142,00:05:02.21,00:05:02.21,">> LET'S SHAKE ON IT, LOOK ME IN THE EYE."
143,00:05:04.04,00:05:04.04,100%.
144,00:05:05.04,00:05:05.04,YOU KNOW I'M GOOD FOR THAT.
145,00:05:06.04,00:05:06.04,>> OKAY.
146,00:05:07.25,00:05:07.25,">> I REALLY NEED A REWARD RIGHT NOW,"
147,00:05:08.54,00:05:08.54,ESPECIALLY SOME FOOD.
148,00:05:10.17,00:05:10.17,"I AM LITERALLY STARVING,"
149,00:05:11.38,00:05:11.38,"AND ASIDE FROM HOLLY,"
150,00:05:13.33,00:05:13.33,"I'VE GONE THE LONGEST WITHOUT A FOOD REWARD RECENTLY,"
151,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,SO I'M KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED
152,00:05:19.88,00:05:19.88,THAT THERE'S SOME FOOD ON THE HORIZON.
153,00:05:25.08,00:05:25.08,">> Jeff: COME ON, IN GUYS."
154,00:05:35.21,00:05:35.21,DAY 30.

161,00:05:47.33,00:05:47.33,HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
162,00:05:48.79,00:05:48.79,"ON MY GO YOU'LL RACE THROUGH A MUD PIT,"
163,00:05:51.12,00:05:51.12,THEN DIG THROUGH A PILE OF HAY TO RETRIEVE A BALL.
164,00:05:53.21,00:05:53.21,YOU'LL BOUNCE THE BALL OFF A SHIELD INTO A BARREL.
165,00:05:56.25,00:05:56.25,FIRST FOUR PEOPLE

168,00:06:00.96,00:06:00.96,IN THIS ROUND YOU'LL USE A STICK
169,00:06:02.75,00:06:02.75,TO RETRIEVE A KEY HANGING OVERHEAD.
170,00:06:04.67,00:06:04.67,THE KEY UNLOCKS A CHEST
171,00:06:06.08,00:06:06.08,THAT CONTAINS FOUR SAND BAGS.
172,00:06:08.25,00:06:08.25,YOU'LL THEN ATTEMPT TO LAND YOUR SAND BAGS
173,00:06:10.67,00:06:10.67,ON TOP OF A BARREL.

420,00:15:07.79,00:15:07.79,THEY'RE GOING TO BE GUNNING FOR US.

424,00:15:12.54,00:15:12.54,>> I'M SO STUPID
425,00:15:13.54,00:15:13.54,FOR NOT PICKING SASH.

427,00:15:17.21,00:15:17.21,"IT'S GOING TO BE JANE, YOU AND ME."
428,00:15:19.12,00:15:19.12,THAT'S THE PECKING ORDER
429,00:15:20.71,00:15:20.71,THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO.
430,00:15:21.71,00:15:21.71,IT'S GOING TO BE THE THREE OF US
431,00:15:22.92,00:15:22.92,BRIGHT AND EARLY.
432,00:15:24.25,00:15:24.25,WE NEED TO TALK LATER JUST YOU AND I.
433,00:15:26.00,00:15:26.00,>> I'VE BEEN A LITTLE FLIGHTY

437,00:15:32.29,00:15:32.29,WHICH COULD COME BACK TO HURT ME.
438,00:15:33.79,00:15:33.79,IT'S MISTAKES THAT I'M MAKING.
439,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,I DON'T NEED TO BE DOING THAT TOO MUCH
440,00:15:36.62,00:15:36.62,BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE STOP TRUSTING ME.
441,00:15:38.00,00:15:38.00,"NOW SASH IS BACK AT CAMP WITH BENRY, FABIO AND DAN."
442,00:15:41.25,00:15:41.25,THAT'S TERRIBLE.
443,00:15:42.50,00:15:42.50,THEY COULD FORGE ONE UP AND PICK US OFF ONE BY ONE.
444,00:15:45.62,00:15:45.62,I GOT TO GET BACK TO CAMP TOMORROW
445,00:15:47.42,00:15:47.42,AND FIGURE OUT WHERE SASH'S HEAD IS AT.
446,00:15:49.42,00:15:49.42,THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.
447,00:15:51.17,00:15:51.17,>> I LOVE MASSAGES.

450,00:16:02.12,00:16:02.12,>> I DON'T WANT SASH TO THINK
451,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,THAT HE CAN GO WITH CHASE.

453,00:16:07.79,00:16:07.79,WE DEFINITELY WANT SASH TO THINK

455,00:16:11.29,00:16:11.29,IF HE GOES WITH CHASE AND THOSE GIRLS.
456,00:16:13.25,00:16:13.25,">> TRUST ME, HE KNOWS WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM."
457,00:16:15.08,00:16:15.08,>> NOT ONLY ARE HOLLY AND CHASE

459,00:16:18.12,00:16:18.12,NOBODY WANTS TO GO
460,00:16:19.29,00:16:19.29,TO THE FINAL THREE WITH JANE ANYWAY.

463,00:16:23.46,00:16:23.46,AND JUMP ON BOARD WITH US
464,00:16:24.83,00:16:24.83,AND TAKE HIMSELF A LOT FURTHER IN THIS GAME.
465,00:16:27.12,00:16:27.12,">> HEY, DINNER."

468,00:16:36.00,00:16:36.00,WE KILLED HER CHICKEN
469,00:16:37.25,00:16:37.25,AND ATE IT WITHOUT HER?
470,00:16:38.12,00:16:38.12,>> HER CHICKEN?
471,00:16:39.25,00:16:39.25,>> I THINK THE ALLIANCES
472,00:16:40.71,00:16:40.71,WERE REALLY DEFINED TODAY.
473,00:16:42.00,00:16:42.00,WE CAN REALLY USE SASH
474,00:16:43.92,00:16:43.92,TO OUR ADVANTAGE IN THIS GAME.
475,00:16:45.54,00:16:45.54,I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.
476,00:16:47.92,00:16:47.92,THAT KID HAS BEEN SHIFTY
477,00:16:50.08,00:16:50.08,THIS ENTIRE GAME
478,00:16:51.12,00:16:51.12,AND HASN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE
479,00:16:52.54,00:16:52.54,TO MAKE UP HIS MIND.
480,00:16:53.83,00:16:53.83,SO I HAVE A FEELING
481,00:16:54.83,00:16:54.83,HE'S STILL IN THE SAME BOAT
482,00:16:56.12,00:16:56.12,AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
483,00:16:57.12,00:16:57.12,"HE'S A LOT CLOSER TO HOLLY,"
484,00:16:58.58,00:16:58.58,"JANE AND CHASE THAN DAN, FABIO AND I."
485,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,>> KELLY-NAY.
486,00:17:03.54,00:17:03.54,>> KELLY-NAY NO LONGER.

490,00:17:36.88,00:17:36.88,FOR 20 DAYS PROBABLY.
491,00:17:40.92,00:17:40.92,I DID LOVE MY CHICKEN.
492,00:17:43.46,00:17:43.46,THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO EAT HER.

495,00:17:53.79,00:17:53.79,SO I MADE HER A LITTLE MEMORIAL OVER THERE
496,00:17:56.21,00:17:56.21,"AND MADE HER A LITTLE CROSS,"
497,00:17:57.62,00:17:57.62,A LITTLE HEART SHAPE
498,00:17:59.29,00:17:59.29,OUT OF THE LITTLE SHELLS
499,00:18:00.79,00:18:00.79,FROM THE HERMIT CRABS
500,00:18:02.38,00:18:02.38,THAT I MADE
501,00:18:04.12,00:18:04.12,AND TOLD HER A LITTLE PRAYER
502,00:18:05.58,00:18:05.58,AND CRIED OVER HER AND WENT DOWN TO THE BEACH
503,00:18:07.54,00:18:07.54,AND WAS SAD FOR A LITTLE BIT.
504,00:18:09.21,00:18:09.21,"YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,"
505,00:18:11.33,00:18:11.33,"BUT HAD I NOT WON THAT REWARD CHALLENGE,"
506,00:18:13.21,00:18:13.21,I WAS GOING TO TAKE HER DOWN IN THE WOODS
507,00:18:15.38,00:18:15.38,AND RUN WITH HER AND HIDE.

520,00:18:38.12,00:18:38.12,TO THE FINALS AND DROP HER.
521,00:18:40.25,00:18:40.25,WE NEED TO MAKE SASH THINK 100% THAT HE'S...

626,00:22:16.29,00:22:16.29,">> WELL, EITHER OR."
627,00:22:17.75,00:22:17.75,IT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE CHALLENGE.

629,00:22:24.29,00:22:24.29,>> SASH IS BACK THERE TALKING
630,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,TO CHASE AND HOLLY TOGETHER.

633,00:22:32.21,00:22:32.21,BUT OUR PLAN IS DOOMED.
634,00:22:36.50,00:22:36.50,">> YOU KNOW,"

637,00:22:41.71,00:22:41.71,THAT WERE GOING TO GO IN
638,00:22:43.38,00:22:43.38,"AND PICK THESE GUYS OFF ONE BY ONE,"
639,00:22:44.75,00:22:44.75,"HOLLY, JANE AND CHASE,"
640,00:22:45.96,00:22:45.96,BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST SASH.
641,00:22:47.67,00:22:47.67,I DON'T TRUST SASH.
642,00:22:48.92,00:22:48.92,BUT I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP
643,00:22:50.08,00:22:50.08,"WITH MAMA HOLLY,"
644,00:22:52.29,00:22:52.29,AND CHASE IS MY BOY SINCE DAY ONE.
645,00:22:54.21,00:22:54.21,"YOU KNOW,"
646,00:22:55.75,00:22:55.75,SO WE'LL SEE IF I CAN END UP
647,00:22:57.08,00:22:57.08,CONFIDING IN THEM
648,00:22:58.29,00:22:58.29,AND CREATE MYSELF A NEW ALLIANCE.
649,00:23:00.12,00:23:00.12,"SO I DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW,"
650,00:23:02.08,00:23:02.08,I FOUND A WAY TO SAVE MY ASS.
651,00:23:04.29,00:23:04.29,">> OH, YEAH."
652,00:23:05.33,00:23:05.33,>> COME ON DOWN.
653,00:23:08.00,00:23:08.00,>> WE'RE TALKING FABIO.
654,00:23:09.17,00:23:09.17,>> LET'S GET ON THE SAME PAGE.
655,00:23:11.96,00:23:11.96,">> WELL, WE'RE THINKING"
656,00:23:15.08,00:23:15.08,YOU TALKED TO HIM EARLIER.
657,00:23:17.38,00:23:17.38,DID YOU TELL HIM?
658,00:23:18.46,00:23:18.46,I THINK FABIO SHOULD BE THE NEXT.
659,00:23:20.71,00:23:20.71,">> I'M FINE DOING THAT,"
660,00:23:22.67,00:23:22.67,"AS LONG AS I STAY, DUDE."
661,00:23:24.29,00:23:24.29,JUST KEEP ME IN THE LOOP.
662,00:23:26.25,00:23:26.25,I WANT TO MAKE IT
663,00:23:27.54,00:23:27.54,ONE MORE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
664,00:23:28.92,00:23:28.92,">> AND JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU GUYS,"
665,00:23:30.62,00:23:30.62,I'M NOT SURE...
666,00:23:32.21,00:23:32.21,>> WOULD YOU VOTE HIM OUT?
667,00:23:33.46,00:23:33.46,">> WELL, HE HAS TO GO EVENTUALLY"
668,00:23:36.21,00:23:36.21,"IF I WANT TO MAKE IT TO THE END,"
669,00:23:38.21,00:23:38.21,SO HOPEFULLY FABIO
670,00:23:39.92,00:23:39.92,DOESN'T WIN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
671,00:23:41.42,00:23:41.42,THAT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
672,00:23:44.29,00:23:44.29,"FOR ME IF HE DOES, OBVIOUSLY."
673,00:23:45.54,00:23:45.54,>> WHY?
674,00:23:47.46,00:23:47.46,">> WELL, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW."
675,00:23:49.08,00:23:49.08,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR OBLIGATIONS TO JANE ARE,"
676,00:23:51.29,00:23:51.29,BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF YOU WANT TO END UP
677,00:23:53.21,00:23:53.21,IN THE TOP THREE WITH JANE.
678,00:23:54.33,00:23:54.33,>> RIGHT.
679,00:23:55.71,00:23:55.71,>> SO EITHER JANE OR FABIO NEXT?
680,00:23:58.29,00:23:58.29,>> I CAME OVER
681,00:24:01.21,00:24:01.21,AND I TALKED TO CHASE AND HOLLY
682,00:24:02.92,00:24:02.92,"FOR A LITTLE BIT,"
683,00:24:04.21,00:24:04.21,"AND, YOU KNOW,"
684,00:24:05.83,00:24:05.83,THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM
685,00:24:07.29,00:24:07.29,VOTING OUT FABIO.
686,00:24:08.46,00:24:08.46,"I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE BEATING AROUND THE BUSH,"
687,00:24:10.38,00:24:10.38,IF THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ME WHEN I WAS WALKING UP.
688,00:24:12.29,00:24:12.29,"SASH WAS IN ON THE CONVERSATION, AS WELL,"
689,00:24:14.17,00:24:14.17,AND I LET HIM KNOW THAT
690,00:24:16.79,00:24:16.79,"AS LONG AS I'M NOT GOING HOME,"
691,00:24:18.21,00:24:18.21,"YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM"
692,00:24:19.75,00:24:19.75,VOTING FABIO OUT.
693,00:24:21.79,00:24:21.79,"I KNOW IT WOULD BE BREAKING UP MY ALLIANCE A LITTLE BIT,"
694,00:24:24.17,00:24:24.17,BUT IT'S AMAZING.
695,00:24:26.00,00:24:26.00,IT'S CRAZY WHAT A COUPLE HOURS
696,00:24:28.29,00:24:28.29,CAN DO AROUND CAMP.

836,00:29:33.79,00:29:33.79,I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL
837,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,TO WIN MY MILLION.
838,00:29:37.29,00:29:37.29,>> ALL THAT BRAIN WORK.
839,00:29:39.25,00:29:39.25,>> MY HEAD WAS HURTING JUST WATCHING YOU GUYS.
840,00:29:41.38,00:29:41.38,">> MOST OF THE CHALLENGES I'VE BEEN SAND BAGGING,"
841,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,"GOING MAYBE 70%, 80%,"
842,00:29:47.83,00:29:47.83,"AND NOW I LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE BENRY AND FABIO,"
843,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,"WHO HAVE BEEN GOING 110% EVERY CHALLENGE,"
844,00:29:54.17,00:29:54.17,AND THE REASON WHY THEY PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT
845,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,TO THE FINAL IS BECAUSE THEY ARE
846,00:29:58.21,00:29:58.21,A PHYSICAL THREAT TO WIN THE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
847,00:30:00.83,00:30:00.83,>> WILL YOU LET THEM...
848,00:30:04.21,00:30:04.21,WILL YOU LET ME KNOW IF MY NAME COMES UP?
849,00:30:06.38,00:30:06.38,>> YEAH.
850,00:30:07.88,00:30:07.88,YES.
851,00:30:09.12,00:30:09.12,>> I JUST GOT AN UNEASY FEELING THIS MORNING
852,00:30:13.46,00:30:13.46,"AND THEN, YOU KNOW,"
853,00:30:16.29,00:30:16.29,I JUST THINK THAT CHASE FEELS
854,00:30:19.12,00:30:19.12,"THAT HE'S REALLY CLOSE TO BENRY,"
855,00:30:20.46,00:30:20.46,"SO IF THEY WANTED TO PULL SOMETHING,"
856,00:30:22.46,00:30:22.46,I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE ON ME.
857,00:30:24.29,00:30:24.29,DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
858,00:30:25.58,00:30:25.58,>> YEAH.
859,00:30:27.08,00:30:27.08,">> BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO DO SOMETHING,"
860,00:30:29.17,00:30:29.17,THEY HAVE TO HAVE YOU.
861,00:30:30.58,00:30:30.58,SO YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR IT EITHER WAY.
862,00:30:32.58,00:30:32.58,YOU CAN LET THEM THINK
863,00:30:34.96,00:30:34.96,"YOU'LL GO ALONG WITH WHAT THEY SAY OR WHATEVER,"
864,00:30:37.54,00:30:37.54,BUT PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
865,00:30:40.25,00:30:40.25,>> I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS THE INSIDE SCOOP.
866,00:30:42.12,00:30:42.12,>> MY INSTINCTS TELL ME
867,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,"THAT SASH IS STILL A BIT OF A SWING VOTE,"
868,00:30:46.92,00:30:46.92,"YOU KNOW, BUT HE'S CLOSER TO ME"
869,00:30:50.12,00:30:50.12,"THAN ANYBODY ON THE TRIBE,"
870,00:30:51.33,00:30:51.33,"SO IF HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF A SWING VOTE,"
871,00:30:54.00,00:30:54.00,"AND IT'S MY NAME ON THE OTHER SIDE,"
872,00:30:55.79,00:30:55.79,"HE'S GOING TO TELL ME, I FEEL LIKE."
873,00:30:57.54,00:30:57.54,>> LET'S JUST ASK DAN WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
874,00:30:59.33,00:30:59.33,>> I FEEL LIKE SITTING BACK RIGHT NOW
875,00:31:01.71,00:31:01.71,"AND BEING COOL IS PART OF IT, YOU KNOW?"
876,00:31:03.79,00:31:03.79,"WE'LL SEE, THOUGH."
877,00:31:05.88,00:31:05.88,"YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO TELL AND..."
878,00:31:07.75,00:31:07.75,"WE'LL SEE, MAN."
879,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,">> HEY, MAN."
880,00:31:13.08,00:31:13.08,>> WHAT'S UP?
881,00:31:14.54,00:31:14.54,>> WHO ARE YOU THINKING?
882,00:31:15.71,00:31:15.71,>> I DON'T KNOW.
883,00:31:16.88,00:31:16.88,WHO ARE YOU THINKING?
884,00:31:18.25,00:31:18.25,">> AS FAR AS I KNOW,"
885,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,EVERYONE...
886,00:31:22.21,00:31:22.21,EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING FABIO.
887,00:31:23.62,00:31:23.62,>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
888,00:31:29.54,00:31:29.54,>> IT'S EASY THEN.
889,00:31:31.25,00:31:31.25,>> OKAY. YOU GOT IT?
890,00:31:32.71,00:31:32.71,>> I GUESS SO.
891,00:31:34.17,00:31:34.17,"RIGHT NOW CHASE AND I ARE STRINGING ALONG FABIO,"
892,00:31:37.17,00:31:37.17,BENRY AND DAN
893,00:31:38.71,00:31:38.71,INTO THINKING DIFFERENT THINGS
894,00:31:40.75,00:31:40.75,OF WHO IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
895,00:31:42.17,00:31:42.17,RIGHT NOW THE TWO NAMES ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK
896,00:31:44.25,00:31:44.25,ARE FABIO AND BENRY.
897,00:31:46.79,00:31:46.79,MY STOMACH IS MESSED UP.
898,00:31:49.29,00:31:49.29,SO THEY REALLY HAVE NO IDEA
899,00:31:50.54,00:31:50.54,WHAT'S GOING ON.
900,00:31:51.71,00:31:51.71,I'M GOING TO KEEP THEM GUESSING
901,00:31:52.96,00:31:52.96,"UNTIL I FEEL LIKE TELLING THEM,"
902,00:31:54.25,00:31:54.25,OR NOT TELLING THEM.
903,00:32:02.25,00:32:02.25,>> JANE. JANE.
904,00:32:04.33,00:32:04.33,>> WHAT UP?
905,00:32:08.33,00:32:08.33,>> DO YOU THINK HE'LL BUY THAT?
906,00:32:09.75,00:32:09.75,>> YEAH.
907,00:32:10.83,00:32:10.83,>> I DON'T THINK SO.
908,00:32:11.92,00:32:11.92,>> WHY?
909,00:32:13.08,00:32:13.08,>> I THINK IT'S BETTER TO TELL HIM
910,00:32:15.12,00:32:15.12,THAT WE'RE GOING TO VOTE OFF HOLLY.
911,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,>> I'LL DO WHATEVER.
912,00:32:19.29,00:32:19.29,">> SASH, ARE YOU WILLING TO DO THAT?"
913,00:32:21.38,00:32:21.38,>> HUH?
914,00:32:22.38,00:32:22.38,>> CAN YOU DO THAT?
915,00:32:23.38,00:32:23.38,>> WHAT?
916,00:32:24.83,00:32:24.83,>> JUST CONVINCE FABIO
917,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,"THAT ME, YOU AND DAN"
918,00:32:28.00,00:32:28.00,ARE GOING TO VOTE HOLLY?
919,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,">> I FEEL GUILTY FOR LYING,"
920,00:32:31.12,00:32:31.12,BUT AS LONG AS IT'S NOT ME GOING HOME NEXT
921,00:32:33.79,00:32:33.79,"AND EVERYBODY AGREES THAT, YOU KNOW,"
922,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,"THEY'LL VOTE OFF FABIO,"
923,00:32:36.50,00:32:36.50,I THINK IT WILL BE PRETTY SIMPLE TO PITCH TO FABIO
924,00:32:38.62,00:32:38.62,"THAT WE WANT TO GET HOLLY OUT OF HERE,"
925,00:32:41.12,00:32:41.12,AND I DON'T THINK HE'LL BUY THE WHOLE JANE THING
926,00:32:44.33,00:32:44.33,"JUST IN TERMS OF CHASE AND JANE BEING SO CLOSE,"
927,00:32:47.96,00:32:47.96,"SO AS LONG AS I'M NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT,"
928,00:32:49.96,00:32:49.96,I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
929,00:32:51.42,00:32:51.42,TO STAY HERE FOR ONE MORE NIGHT.
930,00:32:53.96,00:32:53.96,>> SASH SAID HE WOULD VOTE HOLLY.
931,00:32:57.38,00:32:57.38,"DUDE, HE REALIZES WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM"
932,00:33:01.29,00:33:01.29,IN TERMS OF ALLIANCE-WISE.
933,00:33:02.58,00:33:02.58,>> HOLLY OR JANE?
934,00:33:04.50,00:33:04.50,>> HOLLY.
935,00:33:06.17,00:33:06.17,>> HOLLY?
936,00:33:07.21,00:33:07.21,I'LL VOTE HOLLY.
937,00:33:08.17,00:33:08.17,">> ME, YOU, DAN AND SASH"
938,00:33:09.58,00:33:09.58,ARE GOING TO VOTE HOLLY.
939,00:33:10.83,00:33:10.83,>> AND THEN CHASE?
940,00:33:12.04,00:33:12.04,>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO CHASE.
941,00:33:13.42,00:33:13.42,"AS LONG AS US FOUR VOTE HOLLY,"
942,00:33:15.46,00:33:15.46,WE'RE GOOD.
943,00:33:16.83,00:33:16.83,>> STICK TO THAT
944,00:33:18.12,00:33:18.12,AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DO MUCH POLITICKING.
945,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,>> THEN THE DAY IS MELLOW.
946,00:33:21.12,00:33:21.12,WE LAY LOW.
947,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,">> YEAH, I WAS FEELING A LITTLE WORRIED EARLIER."
948,00:33:24.67,00:33:24.67,I WASN'T SURE IF MY NAME
949,00:33:26.88,00:33:26.88,WAS BEING THROWN AROUND OR THIS AND THAT.
950,00:33:28.92,00:33:28.92,"IT MADE SENSE FOR THEM TO WANT TO GET ME OUT, I THOUGHT,"
951,00:33:31.71,00:33:31.71,"SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT GETTING HOLLY OUT, YOU KNOW."
952,00:33:34.83,00:33:34.83,I THINK SHE'S OVERSTAYED HER WELCOME ALMOST.
953,00:33:37.38,00:33:37.38,SHE'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT...
954,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,I'M JUST I'M READY FOR HER TO GO.
955,00:33:42.46,00:33:42.46,>> READY TO GO ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS OUT HERE?
956,00:33:45.92,00:33:45.92,>> YEAH.
957,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,>> ME TOO.
958,00:33:48.08,00:33:48.08,>> I MEAN...
959,00:33:49.08,00:33:49.08,>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
960,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,IF YOU WEREN'T OUT HERE.
961,00:33:51.71,00:33:51.71,YOU REALLY ARE LIKE A SECOND MOM TO ME.
962,00:33:53.08,00:33:53.08,">> WELL, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT,"
963,00:33:54.42,00:33:54.42,BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED
964,00:33:55.67,00:33:55.67,WAS I GOT PICKED BEFORE.
965,00:33:57.29,00:33:57.29,REALLY.
966,00:33:58.29,00:33:58.29,">> WELL, IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME"
967,00:34:01.25,00:34:01.25,THAT YOU'RE OUT HERE
968,00:34:02.54,00:34:02.54,AND THAT YOU TRUST ME ENOUGH
969,00:34:04.38,00:34:04.38,THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.
970,00:34:05.71,00:34:05.71,"SO JUST KNOW THAT I HAVE YOUR BACK, OKAY?"
971,00:34:08.54,00:34:08.54,>> I GOT YOURS.
972,00:34:09.67,00:34:09.67,>> THANK YOU.
973,00:34:10.58,00:34:10.58,>> I FEEL REAL GOOD
974,00:34:12.12,00:34:12.12,BECAUSE I THINK OUR FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE
975,00:34:13.92,00:34:13.92,IS GOING TO STAY STRONG
976,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,"AND HOPEFULLY OUR FOUR,"
977,00:34:16.88,00:34:16.88,"WHICH IS CHASE, HOLLY, SASH AND ME"
978,00:34:21.75,00:34:21.75,WILL BE IN THE FINAL FOUR.
979,00:34:23.79,00:34:23.79,">> NOW THAT I KNOW I HAVE CHASE, YOU AND HOLLY..."
980,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,>> WE GOT FOUR GOOD PEOPLE.
981,00:34:28.46,00:34:28.46,>> I THINK WE ALL FELL IN PLACE
982,00:34:30.46,00:34:30.46,"BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE'RE LOYAL,"
983,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,SINCERE AND THAT WE'RE JUST GOOD PEOPLE.
984,00:34:35.29,00:34:35.29,">> YES, YES."
985,00:34:37.29,00:34:37.29,>> YOU CAN'T BACKSTAB SOMEONE WHO YOU HAVE LOTS OF LOVE FOR.
986,00:34:40.29,00:34:40.29,>> NO.
987,00:34:41.21,00:34:41.21,">> YOU CAN'T BACKSTAB MY MOM,"
988,00:34:42.71,00:34:42.71,CAN'T BACKSTAB MY SECOND MOM.
989,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,>> OKAY.
990,00:34:45.38,00:34:45.38,"ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT."
991,00:34:46.71,00:34:46.71,LET'S GO.
992,00:34:47.75,00:34:47.75,I REALLY AND TRULY THINK
993,00:34:49.04,00:34:49.04,SASH HAS A GREAT HEART
994,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,AND SASH IS NOT GOING TO GO WITH THEM.
995,00:34:52.42,00:34:52.42,SASH IS GUARANTEED FINAL FOUR WITH US.
996,00:34:55.67,00:34:55.67,"I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE HIM OUT."
997,00:34:57.58,00:34:57.58,FABIO AND BENRY HAVE BEEN
998,00:34:59.96,00:34:59.96,A PHYSICAL THREAT SINCE DAY ONE.
999,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,"ALWAYS HAVE, ALWAYS WILL."
1000,00:35:03.62,00:35:03.62,SO EITHER BENRY OR FABIO
1001,00:35:05.54,00:35:05.54,IS GOING HOME TONIGHT.
1002,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,"HOLLY, CHASE AND I,"
1003,00:35:08.58,00:35:08.58,WE NEVER PLANNED THIS IN THE BEGINNING.
1004,00:35:11.08,00:35:11.08,WE JUST CAME TOGETHER
1005,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,AND ENDED UP MESHING.
1006,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,AND IT'S LIKE SPOKES ON A WHEEL.
1007,00:35:16.29,00:35:16.29,WE'RE JUST TURNING THE CLOCK RIGHT NOW.
1008,00:35:18.50,00:35:18.50,TURNING THE CLOCK.
1009,00:35:20.17,00:35:20.17,AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET
1010,00:35:22.58,00:35:22.58,TO PICK THEM OFF ONE BY ONE
1011,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY PLANNED TO DO TO US.
1012,00:35:39.00,00:35:39.00,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
1013,00:35:45.00,00:35:45.00,"ALINA, MARTY, BRENDA,"
1014,00:35:48.42,00:35:48.42,"AND OUR TWO QUITTERS,"
1015,00:35:50.17,00:35:50.17,"NAONKA AND PURPLE KELLY,"
1016,00:35:51.96,00:35:51.96,WHO QUIT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
1017,00:35:59.04,00:35:59.04,"LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REWARD, CHASE."
1018,00:36:01.12,00:36:01.12,PART OF THE REWARD CHALLENGE
1019,00:36:02.92,00:36:02.92,WAS CHOOSING TWO PEOPLE TO GO WITH YOU.
1020,00:36:05.25,00:36:05.25,>> RIGHT.
1021,00:36:06.38,00:36:06.38,">> Jeff: ON ONE HAND,"
1022,00:36:07.38,00:36:07.38,GREAT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY
1023,00:36:09.04,00:36:09.04,TO MAKE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE VERY HAPPY.
1024,00:36:10.75,00:36:10.75,"ON THE OTHER HAND,"
1025,00:36:11.79,00:36:11.79,YOU LEAVE FOUR OTHER PEOPLE BEHIND.
1026,00:36:14.04,00:36:14.04,HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT
1027,00:36:15.50,00:36:15.50,THAT CAN WORK AGAINST YOU?
1028,00:36:17.21,00:36:17.21,>> I WAS PRETTY CONCERNED IT WOULD WORK AGAINST ME.
1029,00:36:19.42,00:36:19.42,"I MEAN, YOU GOT TWO PEOPLE"
1030,00:36:20.96,00:36:20.96,"YOU'RE MAKING HAPPY, FOUR PEOPLE YOU'RE MAKING MAD."
1031,00:36:22.42,00:36:22.42,THAT'S NOT GOOD.
1032,00:36:23.58,00:36:23.58,BUT I HAD TO CHOOSE TWO PEOPLE.
1033,00:36:25.33,00:36:25.33,">> Jeff: CHASE, CONCERNED AT ALL"
1034,00:36:27.17,00:36:27.17,THAT JUST DUE TO BEING YOUNG AND FIT
1035,00:36:29.62,00:36:29.62,THAT YOU'RE A THREAT RIGHT NOW
1036,00:36:31.25,00:36:31.25,BECAUSE YOU COULD CONCEIVABLY WIN YOUR WAY
1037,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,TO A SPOT AT THE FINAL?
1038,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,">> YEAH, I'M A PHYSICAL THREAT,"
1039,00:36:36.38,00:36:36.38,"BUT AT THE SAME TIME,"
1040,00:36:37.75,00:36:37.75,I HAVEN'T WON INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY YET.
1041,00:36:39.25,00:36:39.25,"I THINK IT'S CLEAR FABIO, BENRY AND I"
1042,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,ARE THE THREE BIGGEST PHYSICAL THREATS HERE.
1043,00:36:43.83,00:36:43.83,SO IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WEIGHS ON YOUR MIND.
1044,00:36:45.79,00:36:45.79,GETS YOU A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
1045,00:36:46.96,00:36:46.96,">> Jeff: BENRY, WHERE ARE YOU AT"
1046,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,IN TERMS OF BEING CONCERNED
1047,00:36:49.92,00:36:49.92,YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A PHYSICAL THREAT?
1048,00:36:51.71,00:36:51.71,>> I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED.
1049,00:36:53.29,00:36:53.29,THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
1050,00:36:55.38,00:36:55.38,"THAT THESE GUYS THINK I'M A THREAT,"
1051,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,AND IT CONCERNS ME A LITTLE BIT FOR SURE.
1052,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,">> Jeff: JANE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY LIKE FABIO"
1053,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,AND YOU COMPARE HIM TO YOU
1054,00:37:03.62,00:37:03.62,"WITH THESE CHALLENGES COMING UP,"
1055,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,HOW BIG OF A TARGET
1056,00:37:06.96,00:37:06.96,DO YOU PUT ON HIS BACK?
1057,00:37:08.42,00:37:08.42,">> WELL, HE'S DEFINITELY A LOT STRONGER,"
1058,00:37:10.21,00:37:10.21,"A LOT MORE BUILT,"
1059,00:37:11.71,00:37:11.71,"FASTER,"
1060,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,"MAYBE NOT THE SMARTEST ON THE PUZZLES,"
1061,00:37:15.25,00:37:15.25,"BUT AS FAR AS BEING A PHYSICAL THREAT,"
1062,00:37:17.92,00:37:17.92,"OH, YEAH, HE'S A BIG PHYSICAL THREAT."
1063,00:37:20.46,00:37:20.46,">> Jeff: FABIO, WHAT DO YOU DO"
1064,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,TO KEEP THE TARGET OFF YOUR BACK?
1065,00:37:23.79,00:37:23.79,YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR AGE OR YOUR PHYSICAL ABILITY.
1066,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,>> I STAY FRIENDLY WITH PEOPLE AROUND CAMP.
1067,00:37:28.08,00:37:28.08,I TALK TO EVERYBODY.
1068,00:37:29.79,00:37:29.79,I MAKE SURE THEY KNOW
1069,00:37:31.25,00:37:31.25,THAT I'M PRETTY HONEST AND OPEN.
1070,00:37:33.50,00:37:33.50,"I HAVE TO TRUST MY ALLIANCE TO, YOU KNOW,"
1071,00:37:37.12,00:37:37.12,GET ME FURTHER IN THE GAME
1072,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,AND THOSE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE TOLD
1073,00:37:39.50,00:37:39.50,"THE WHOLE GAME I'VE TRUSTED,"
1074,00:37:41.21,00:37:41.21,"YOU KNOW, WE'LL GO FURTHER IN THE GAME TOGETHER."
1075,00:37:43.88,00:37:43.88,">> Jeff: BENRY, WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO IT NOW, RIGHT?"
1076,00:37:46.08,00:37:46.08,THIS IS WHERE THE BIG MOVES
1077,00:37:48.33,00:37:48.33,ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.
1078,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU
1079,00:37:51.25,00:37:51.25,THAT IT WILL SWING YOUR WAY?
1080,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,>> I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
1081,00:37:56.25,00:37:56.25,THAT IT WILL SWING MY WAY TONIGHT.
1082,00:37:58.04,00:37:58.04,">> Jeff: SASH, GREAT NIGHT"
1083,00:37:59.50,00:37:59.50,TO HAVE IMMUNITY AROUND YOUR NECK.
1084,00:38:01.79,00:38:01.79,>> IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE COME WITH IMMUNITY AROUND MY NECK.
1085,00:38:04.50,00:38:04.50,IT IS A GREAT FEELING.
1086,00:38:06.08,00:38:06.08,IT GIVES ME A CLEARER IDEA COMING INTO TRIBAL.
1087,00:38:09.12,00:38:09.12,"BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU HAVE THIS AROUND YOUR NECK,"
1088,00:38:11.71,00:38:11.71,IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE LIKE TO TALK TO YOU MORE.
1089,00:38:14.38,00:38:14.38,"THE MORE PEOPLE TALK TO YOU IN THIS GAME,"
1090,00:38:17.17,00:38:17.17,THE BETTER YOU PROBABLY ARE.
1091,00:38:18.79,00:38:18.79,">> Jeff: FABIO, DID YOU SEE PEOPLE APPROACHING SASH?"
1092,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,">> YEAH, I DID, DEFINITELY."
1093,00:38:23.79,00:38:23.79,ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HANG AROUND CAMP
1094,00:38:26.29,00:38:26.29,AND WATCH WHO GOES OFF
1095,00:38:28.12,00:38:28.12,"AND TALKS AND THIS AND THAT,"
1096,00:38:29.71,00:38:29.71,BUT I WASN'T WORRIED.
1097,00:38:32.00,00:38:32.00,">> Jeff: HOLLY, DID YOU SEE PEOPLE APPROACHING SASH TODAY?"
1098,00:38:34.62,00:38:34.62,">> YES, I DID."
1099,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,>> Jeff: DOES THAT CONCERN YOU?
1100,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,">> WELL, I THINK IT CONCERNS EVERYONE."
1101,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,>> Jeff: IT DOESN'T CONCERN FABIO.
1102,00:38:41.50,00:38:41.50,HE JUST SAID.
1103,00:38:42.75,00:38:42.75,">> WELL, I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM THEN."
1104,00:38:44.58,00:38:44.58,YOU HAVE TO TALK TO PEOPLE.
1105,00:38:46.42,00:38:46.42,YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
1106,00:38:48.12,00:38:48.12,"IF YOU JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH,"
1107,00:38:50.25,00:38:50.25,YOU MIGHT NOT BE FURTHERING YOURSELF IN THE GAME.
1108,00:38:52.62,00:38:52.62,SO COMMUNICATION IS HUGE.
1109,00:38:55.71,00:38:55.71,">> Jeff: WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE TONIGHT'S VOTE"
1110,00:38:59.50,00:38:59.50,WILL DETERMINE WHICH ALLIANCE HOLDS STRONG
1111,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,AND WHICH ALLIANCE FALLS APART.
1112,00:39:04.29,00:39:04.29,"SASH, YOU HAVE THE NECKLACE."
1113,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,I ASSUME YOU'RE KEEPING IT?
1114,00:39:07.08,00:39:07.08,>> I'M GOING TO HOLD ON TO IT TONIGHT.
1115,00:39:08.42,00:39:08.42,>> Jeff: CANNOT VOTE FOR SASH.
1116,00:39:09.50,00:39:09.50,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
1117,00:39:11.04,00:39:11.04,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
1118,00:39:12.29,00:39:12.29,"DAN, YOU'RE UP."
1119,00:39:59.29,00:39:59.29,I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
1120,00:40:10.33,00:40:10.33,IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
1121,00:40:12.25,00:40:12.25,"AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,"
1122,00:40:13.12,00:40:13.12,NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
1123,00:40:20.29,00:40:20.29,"OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ,"
1124,00:40:21.71,00:40:21.71,THE DECISION IS FINAL.
1125,00:40:22.75,00:40:22.75,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
1126,00:40:24.08,00:40:24.08,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
1127,00:40:25.79,00:40:25.79,I'LL READ THE VOTES.

1157,00:41:52.29,00:41:52.29,REALIZING WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER TRUST THEM.
