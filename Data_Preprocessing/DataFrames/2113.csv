97,00:03:41.38,00:03:41.38,AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL KEEP MEAROUND LONGER.
98,00:03:42.92,00:03:42.92,>> MAKES SENSE.
99,00:03:43.92,00:03:43.92,>> I JUST WANT TO BE UP FRONT.

111,00:04:06.75,00:04:06.75,"YOU KNOW,I'VE DONE THAT WITH YOU."
112,00:04:08.08,00:04:08.08,I'VE DONE THAT WITH BRENDA.

123,00:04:29.92,00:04:29.92,"IF BY SOME REASON,"

843,00:29:54.17,00:29:54.17,AND THE REASON WHYTHEY PROBABLY WON'T MAKE IT
844,00:29:56.21,00:29:56.21,TO THE FINAL IS BECAUSE THEY ARE
845,00:29:58.21,00:29:58.21,A PHYSICAL THREAT TO WINTHE FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
