3,00:00:05.57,00:00:05.57,>> The stupid shelter; that I built was destroyed.
4,00:00:08.47,00:00:08.47,Digging into the sand is the dumbest idea
5,00:00:10.60,00:00:10.60,"I've ever had in my life. >> PROBST: But at Chapera,"
6,00:00:13.33,00:00:13.33,the tribe weathered the storm in comfort...
7,00:00:15.70,00:00:15.70,>> I slept almost all night long.
8,00:00:17.93,00:00:17.93,>> PROBST: ...giving Rob and Amber's alliance a chance
9,00:00:19.87,00:00:19.87,to heat up. >> You're so warm.
10,00:00:23.03,00:00:23.03,>> Boston Rob and Amber are going to do it.
11,00:00:26.37,00:00:26.37,">> PROBST: At the reward challenge, Chapera continued"
12,00:00:28.77,00:00:28.77,their winning streak. Chapera... rice tonight.
13,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,"In addition, take a shower, get cleaned up."
14,00:00:34.57,00:00:34.57,"Back at camp, the tribe got clean"
15,00:00:37.13,00:00:37.13,and found the final key to their lockbox.
16,00:00:40.50,00:00:40.50,">> Oh. >> You guys, that's alcohol."
17,00:00:42.90,00:00:42.90,"That's whiskey. >> Hey, guys, we got rice!"
18,00:00:46.60,00:00:46.60,>> PROBST: The rice helped Chapera to an early lead
19,00:00:49.07,00:00:49.07,during a very physical immunity challenge.
20,00:00:51.47,00:00:51.47,"Chapera, first to start building the puzzle."
21,00:00:53.77,00:00:53.77,"But the puzzle proved difficult, and Saboga and Mogo Mogo"
22,00:00:56.93,00:00:56.93,"both took immunity, leaving Chapera"
23,00:01:00.23,00:01:00.23,"with their first immunity loss. Before Tribal Council,"
24,00:01:03.47,00:01:03.47,the two Robs made a pact. >> We can make good allies.
25,00:01:07.03,00:01:07.03,>> I agree. >> I made an alliance with
26,00:01:09.43,00:01:09.43,"Boston Rob, and a deal's a deal. >> PROBST: But at Tribal"
27,00:01:13.50,00:01:13.50,"Council, Rob C. learned he'd been played."
28,00:01:16.53,00:01:16.53,"Rob, the tribe has spoken. Fourteen are left."
29,00:01:20.63,00:01:20.63,Who will be voted out tonight? (birds chirping)
30,00:02:50.77,00:02:50.77,">> Uno, dos, tres, cuatro. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Well, last time I seen"
31,00:02:54.73,00:02:54.73,her standing on a hill \xe2\x99\xaa Shaking her boobs and... \xe2\x99\xaa
32,00:02:58.50,00:02:58.50,( all yelling and singing ) >> We got to build a boat!
33,00:03:05.53,00:03:05.53,">> Oh, my God. >> I did this in Marquesas."
34,00:03:09.63,00:03:09.63,">> ""Put on your game face for this reward"
35,00:03:12.47,00:03:12.47,you will compete. This may change your situation
36,00:03:14.13,00:03:14.13,and the quantities you eat. Here are the supplies
37,00:03:17.03,00:03:17.03,"to build a raft, one that four of you can race."
38,00:03:19.60,00:03:19.60,"Tribe pride is on the line. You'd better keep up the pace."""
39,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,">> Four of us can race. Chances are, Tom, you might"
40,00:03:26.03,00:03:26.03,"sit out, 'cause you're the biggest guy."
41,00:03:27.40,00:03:27.40,"You're going to drag the boat down, so..."
42,00:03:28.93,00:03:28.93,">> I'm an anchor. >> Well, this morning we got"
43,00:03:30.83,00:03:30.83,some tree mail which involves building a raft.
44,00:03:33.07,00:03:33.07,"We got a bunch of bamboo, some rope and one paddle."
45,00:03:36.13,00:03:36.13,The biggest part of the challenge is obviously
46,00:03:38.33,00:03:38.33,building it. >> We'll probably be... here...
47,00:03:53.63,00:03:53.63,to have the two power strokes. You'll be there.
48,00:03:55.90,00:03:55.90,You'll be there. You put two bundles and then
49,00:03:58.83,00:03:58.83,the platform right on it. Then we're making outriggers.
50,00:04:01.60,00:04:01.60,"It's like a big catamaran. >> Apparently, we're building"
51,00:04:04.50,00:04:04.50,"a pontoon boat, a catamaran possibly-- I'm not sure--"
52,00:04:09.70,00:04:09.70,with two bundles of bamboo underneath supporting the
53,00:04:11.83,00:04:11.83,platform. It sounds great in theory.
54,00:04:15.97,00:04:15.97,I hope it works. I'm a little bit worried
55,00:04:18.70,00:04:18.70,"about building stuff now, ever since our..."
56,00:04:21.17,00:04:21.17,first shelter fiasco. >> I love it.
57,00:04:25.83,00:04:25.83,>> Let's start lashing the top to it.
58,00:04:27.70,00:04:27.70,I feel very good about the raft. I'm trying to not think
59,00:04:30.77,00:04:30.77,"about the house. You know, I got my reputation"
60,00:04:33.43,00:04:33.43,"riding on this damn thing again. >> Okay, guys, we have"
61,00:04:36.83,00:04:36.83,to win this today. We're going to have to paddle
62,00:04:39.10,00:04:39.10,our asses off. >> We came up with a good
63,00:04:41.53,00:04:41.53,"design, and with four paddles, we should be able to fly."
64,00:04:44.03,00:04:44.03,We want to win. >> The key is you got to use
65,00:04:54.47,00:04:54.47,"every blooming piece of bamboo. >> Do you use full length,"
66,00:04:57.37,00:04:57.37,or do you make it shorter? >> Full length.
67,00:04:59.33,00:04:59.33,>> Yeah? >> Why?
68,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,">> 'Cause, you know what? It's too much energy"
69,00:05:03.20,00:05:03.20,"to cut it down. >> It could be very,"
70,00:05:05.37,00:05:05.37,"very, very simple. These bundles, as they are,"
71,00:05:07.97,00:05:07.97,will never sink. Don't think too hard.
72,00:05:10.63,00:05:10.63,Simple is always better. The challenge was
73,00:05:13.47,00:05:13.47,to construct a raft... that was worthy...
74,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,of the sea and could carry four of us.
75,00:05:20.13,00:05:20.13,So that meant this raft not only had to carry Lex
76,00:05:23.07,00:05:23.07,"and Kathy and I and a normal human being,"
77,00:05:25.60,00:05:25.60,but it's got to carry 260 pounds of Hatch.
78,00:05:29.00,00:05:29.00,>> I think it's good for steering.
79,00:05:32.10,00:05:32.10,>> Let's kind of go back and forth and see how stable it is.
80,00:05:34.93,00:05:34.93,"But ultimately, it came down to laziness"
81,00:05:37.57,00:05:37.57,"and pure exhaustion that designed that raft,"
82,00:05:40.43,00:05:40.43,and nothing more. >> The raft will definitely
83,00:05:46.10,00:05:46.10,"float, but it won't be swift. It will not be swift."
84,00:05:56.40,00:05:56.40,>> I'm going to tell you something.
85,00:05:58.53,00:05:58.53,That raft... That one's going to
86,00:06:03.63,00:06:03.63,win us this challenge. >> I say nice rack...
87,00:06:05.60,00:06:05.60,"Oh, raft. >> Yeah, wait."
88,00:06:09.43,00:06:09.43,"Have you been drinking? >> No. No, I just..."
89,00:06:12.30,00:06:12.30,"I-I meant ""raft"" when I said ""rack."""
90,00:06:15.17,00:06:15.17,">> Hey, Tom, I got your waterbed for you."
91,00:06:17.80,00:06:17.80,>> All right. >> That's the best built thing
92,00:06:21.30,00:06:21.30,since Alicia. >> If I could vote anybody out
93,00:06:24.60,00:06:24.60,"right now, it'd be Tom. He's a stupid drunk."
94,00:06:28.47,00:06:28.47,A stupid klutzy drunk. I don't care for the man
95,00:06:32.50,00:06:32.50,whatsoever. I don't think his sexual
96,00:06:34.47,00:06:34.47,innuendoes are funny. >> I christen the ship.
97,00:06:39.63,00:06:39.63,>> Tom came down with the whiskey to christen the vessel.
98,00:06:41.93,00:06:41.93,">> I christen... >> Oh, yeah!"
99,00:06:43.77,00:06:43.77,">> And I'm like, ""Oh, you guys, don't move, I got to pee."""
100,00:06:46.40,00:06:46.40,So I peed right on the raft. So that we decided that I
101,00:06:55.67,00:06:55.67,christened it right there. >> You pissed on it?
102,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,It's supposed to be pure grain liquor.
103,00:07:00.53,00:07:00.53,Kiss my ass. What a hag.
104,00:07:03.87,00:07:03.87,"My God, that's going to make a hole in the driftwood."
105,00:07:06.90,00:07:06.90,That'll rot any wood I know. I'm afraid the ship's
106,00:07:10.53,00:07:10.53,going to sink now. Where did Sue piss?
107,00:07:13.17,00:07:13.17,">> Right here. >> Go, Tom, you do the honors."
108,00:07:15.77,00:07:15.77,>> Okay. >> I christen thee...
109,00:07:17.97,00:07:17.97,">> I christen thee vessel the Suzie Q., in honor"
110,00:07:21.63,00:07:21.63,of me old lady Sue. ( all cheer )
111,00:07:26.43,00:07:26.43,"And in the honor, I shall take one little goober."
112,00:07:34.97,00:07:34.97,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. What's going on, Saboga?"
113,00:07:42.63,00:07:42.63,">> Life's good. >> PROBST: What's up, Mogo Mogo?"
114,00:07:46.90,00:07:46.90,"Come on in, Chapera. Getting your first look at the"
115,00:07:51.20,00:07:51.20,"new Chapera tribe. >> Damn, Sue's still here."
116,00:07:55.80,00:07:55.80,>> Cesternino. >> PROBST: Rob voted out at the
117,00:07:58.43,00:07:58.43,last Tribal Council. Nobody's safe in this game.
118,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97,"All right, you ready for today's challenge?"
119,00:08:04.63,00:08:04.63,">> Yes, sir. This morning,"
120,00:08:06.20,00:08:06.20,"you were given materials, told to build a raft."
121,00:08:08.33,00:08:08.33,Here's how the challenge works: two tribe members
122,00:08:10.30,00:08:10.30,"will start on the raft. Their job, paddle out and rescue"
123,00:08:13.53,00:08:13.53,two other tribe members who have been stranded
124,00:08:16.37,00:08:16.37,in the water on separate floating platforms.
125,00:08:19.40,00:08:19.40,"Once you've picked up both tribe members,"
126,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,"continue out to a buoy. You'll grab a flag,"
127,00:08:23.23,00:08:23.23,"paddle back to shore up the beach,"
128,00:08:25.13,00:08:25.13,across the finish line. First two tribes to get back
129,00:08:27.50,00:08:27.50,with their boat and run across the finish line
130,00:08:29.70,00:08:29.70,with their flag win reward. Want to know what
131,00:08:32.57,00:08:32.57,you're playing for? >> Yes.
132,00:08:33.90,00:08:33.90,>> PROBST: For the winning tribe...
133,00:08:36.07,00:08:36.07,"What might be in here, Hatch?"
134,00:08:38.10,00:08:38.10,>> Fish hooks. >> PROBST: Fishing hooks.
135,00:08:40.50,00:08:40.50,"To go along with the fishing hooks, a fishing spear."
136,00:08:44.37,00:08:44.37,">> Oh, yeah! >> PROBST: Should make fishing"
137,00:08:47.53,00:08:47.53,"a whole lot easier. In addition, for the"
138,00:08:49.53,00:08:49.53,"first two tribes, a clue to your lock box."
139,00:08:52.27,00:08:52.27,"Chapera, it has no value to you. You've already had your rice"
140,00:08:55.20,00:08:55.20,and most of your whiskey... but for Saboga
141,00:08:57.17,00:08:57.17,"and Mogo Mogo, it could mean rice tonight."
142,00:08:59.80,00:08:59.80,"For the third part of the reward, the tribe that"
143,00:09:02.57,00:09:02.57,finishes last will be dissolved. >> What?
144,00:09:06.47,00:09:06.47,>> PROBST: The tribe members will be absorbed
145,00:09:08.33,00:09:08.33,by the two remaining tribes. We're going to have
146,00:09:10.70,00:09:10.70,"a school yard game of ""Pick 'Em."""
147,00:09:12.50,00:09:12.50,We will alternate picks. The winning tribe
148,00:09:14.37,00:09:14.37,"gets to pick first. For the losing tribe,"
149,00:09:17.67,00:09:17.67,you will not return back to your beach.
150,00:09:19.77,00:09:19.77,Your personal items and any other clothing items will be
151,00:09:22.40,00:09:22.40,"sent to your new home. Everything else: rewards,"
152,00:09:25.27,00:09:25.27,"your shelter, tools, anything else you've acquired,"
153,00:09:27.20,00:09:27.20,you'll never see again. Worth playing for?
154,00:09:28.93,00:09:28.93,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: Chapera, you have"
155,00:09:30.63,00:09:30.63,one extra member. Who sat out during
156,00:09:32.30,00:09:32.30,the building of the raft? >> Big Tom.
157,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,>> PROBST: So you won't participate in this.
158,00:09:36.00,00:09:36.00,"Mogo Mogo, who sat out? >> Shii Ann."
159,00:09:37.83,00:09:37.83,>> PROBST: Shii Ann. So you won't participate either.
160,00:09:39.73,00:09:39.73,I'll give you a couple of minutes to strategize.
161,00:09:41.63,00:09:41.63,"Wait for my go. Here we go, guys:"
162,00:09:47.17,00:09:47.17,a reward challenge with huge stakes.
163,00:09:49.27,00:09:49.27,Survivors ready? Go!
164,00:09:54.00,00:09:54.00,">> Go, Mogo Mogo! >> PROBST: Everybody even"
165,00:09:59.70,00:09:59.70,off the start. All rafts are floating.
166,00:10:03.53,00:10:03.53,That's a good sign. >> We got it.
167,00:10:08.50,00:10:08.50,>> PROBST: Mogo Mogo out to a slight lead.
168,00:10:14.77,00:10:14.77,"Saboga's raft looks nice, but it's slow."
169,00:10:21.63,00:10:21.63,Mogo Mogo pulling away with the worst-looking raft
170,00:10:25.37,00:10:25.37,of the three. Mogo Mogo approaches Kathy.
171,00:10:30.77,00:10:30.77,"Don't jump in, Kathy. Get on."
172,00:10:40.13,00:10:40.13,Mogo Mogo still with the big lead.
173,00:10:42.87,00:10:42.87,"Saboga approaches their first member,"
174,00:10:44.70,00:10:44.70,looking to pick up Jenna. Chapera close to picking up
175,00:10:47.57,00:10:47.57,Alicia. Alicia pulls 'em in
176,00:10:49.97,00:10:49.97,tight and steps onboard. Chapera has their
177,00:10:52.23,00:10:52.23,first tribe member. Saboga has their
178,00:10:54.73,00:10:54.73,first tribe member. Mogo Mogo increases their lead.
179,00:10:58.53,00:10:58.53,"Lex, Colby and Kathy nearing Richard."
180,00:11:02.33,00:11:02.33,Richard pulls 'em close. Hatch is onboard.
181,00:11:07.30,00:11:07.30,( indistinct talking ) >> PROBST: Saboga by far
182,00:11:18.73,00:11:18.73,with the best looking raft and the least effective.
183,00:11:22.93,00:11:22.93,Chapera nears Amber. Amber's onboard.
184,00:11:29.23,00:11:29.23,"Chapera has all their tribe members, heading for the flag."
185,00:11:32.00,00:11:32.00,Mogo Mogo at their flag. Kathy reaches for the flag...
186,00:11:36.40,00:11:36.40,and she has it. Mogo Mogo heading back.
187,00:11:41.50,00:11:41.50,Saboga has all four tribe members.
188,00:11:43.70,00:11:43.70,They're heading for their flag. Chapera making up some ground.
189,00:11:46.97,00:11:46.97,( indistinct shouting ) Chapera reaches for
190,00:11:55.07,00:11:55.07,their tribe flag. They have it-- Chapera
191,00:11:57.50,00:11:57.50,has their flag. They're heading back.

472,00:28:24.60,00:28:24.60,It will be the first time you're voting out a member.
473,00:28:26.93,00:28:26.93,You have this afternoon to think about who that's going to be.
474,00:28:29.40,00:28:29.40,I'll see you there. Head on back.
475,00:28:54.87,00:28:54.87,>> Those guys were freaking out. Did you hear Richard?
476,00:28:57.53,00:28:57.53,"He whined. >> Yeah, they were like,"
477,00:28:59.53,00:28:59.53,"""They're jumping, they're jumping."
478,00:29:01.23,00:29:01.23,"Everybody's jumping!"" >> ""Look, they're all"

480,00:29:05.23,00:29:05.23,"we call it winning. >> Yeah, hell, yeah."
481,00:29:07.03,00:29:07.03,"Some of us got no balance. >> I hope they vote Richard off,"
482,00:29:09.80,00:29:09.80,'cause what he did to me was absolutely...
483,00:29:11.97,00:29:11.97,>> That was disgusting. ( all talking )
484,00:29:14.87,00:29:14.87,">> I wanted to get past, so I wouldn't have to"
485,00:29:17.33,00:29:17.33,battle Richard naked. It felt real good to be able
486,00:29:19.03,00:29:19.03,to propel my team to the win. And I may not be
487,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67,"as strong as some of them, but I guarantee I'm tougher"
488,00:29:22.97,00:29:22.97,than every single one of them. >> Welcome to reality.
489,00:29:26.00,00:29:26.00,And you got Colby in. ( shouting )
490,00:29:28.97,00:29:28.97,>> You got him. >> Colby?
491,00:29:31.17,00:29:31.17,"Yeah, he's not as tough as you think, ladies."
492,00:29:35.27,00:29:35.27,>> Chapera! ( cheering )
493,00:29:47.10,00:29:47.10,">> We lost the challenge, and, uh, it was... it was a blow."
494,00:29:52.80,00:29:52.80,"I really like our tribe, and now we have to go to Tribal."
495,00:29:56.03,00:29:56.03,So... the game is on. For the first time at Mogo
496,00:30:01.63,00:30:01.63,"Mogo, the game is really on. >> Oh, it's a downer."
497,00:30:06.43,00:30:06.43,But I also don't like sitting around the camp
498,00:30:08.60,00:30:08.60,"talking about would have, could have,"
499,00:30:10.37,00:30:10.37,"should have. You know, it's time"
500,00:30:12.90,00:30:12.90,to move on. >> Yeah.
501,00:30:15.33,00:30:15.33,>> This is a game where the more you strategize
502,00:30:17.50,00:30:17.50,"and the more you think about it,"
503,00:30:19.20,00:30:19.20,"the more you change your mind. Because a lot of times,"
504,00:30:21.87,00:30:21.87,your gut will tell you something totally different
505,00:30:23.70,00:30:23.70,than what you've already agreed to do.
506,00:30:26.13,00:30:26.13,"So, basically here's where we are--"
507,00:30:28.33,00:30:28.33,Richard's the one we got to get rid of.
508,00:30:30.57,00:30:30.57,He's the snake in the grass... >> I agree.
509,00:30:32.50,00:30:32.50,>> ...that's gonna cause us the most trouble.
510,00:30:34.50,00:30:34.50,"He's just... he's a cancer in this tribe, and he's going."
511,00:30:37.27,00:30:37.27,"If you give Richard time enough, he will fester and then"
512,00:30:40.17,00:30:40.17,"he will spread, you know? >> But do you think"
513,00:30:42.57,00:30:42.57,he's strong enough to keep around for more challenges?
514,00:30:45.77,00:30:45.77,>> No. No. We can do without him.
515,00:30:47.83,00:30:47.83,"Um... the cool thing is, he thinks we're dropping"
516,00:30:50.53,00:30:50.53,"you tonight, so, we're just going to let him think that,"
517,00:30:57.10,00:30:57.10,okay? >> The plan tonight is
518,00:30:59.93,00:30:59.93,"to vote off Richard Hatch. For all I know, they're going"
519,00:31:03.07,00:31:03.07,"to vote me off. You know, I'm super paranoid,"
520,00:31:05.23,00:31:05.23,"but, um... I think I got a 50-50 shot."
521,00:31:22.90,00:31:22.90,>> Okay? >> All right.
522,00:31:24.50,00:31:24.50,">> I was approached by... Lex, Colby and Ethan"
523,00:31:29.63,00:31:29.63,"to vote for Rich. I immediately said,"
524,00:31:32.43,00:31:32.43,"""Hell, yeah, count me in."" But the downside is,"
525,00:31:37.20,00:31:37.20,it doesn't make any sense for me to team up with
526,00:31:39.67,00:31:39.67,three guys who are then going to kick my ass
527,00:31:42.60,00:31:42.60,in every challenge afterwards. >> He just took off to go...
528,00:31:58.13,00:31:58.13,">> Get clams. >> Clamming, yeah."
529,00:32:00.40,00:32:00.40,">> What's his thought? >> Well, I said, ""I can't tell"
530,00:32:03.07,00:32:03.07,"you ""you're going home tonight, but I can't tell you"
531,00:32:05.33,00:32:05.33,"you're not, either."" You know, you showed"
532,00:32:07.20,00:32:07.20,in those challenges how dominant you are
533,00:32:08.93,00:32:08.93,as a swimmer and runner and everything else.
534,00:32:11.10,00:32:11.10,There's no question nobody wants to compete with you.
535,00:32:13.27,00:32:13.27,>> Right. >> So I guess I got
536,00:32:15.33,00:32:15.33,"to go with you, I got to believe you."
537,00:32:17.20,00:32:17.20,"I got to believe you're with me, 'cause Ethan would be more"
538,00:32:19.83,00:32:19.83,of a physical threat to you.
539,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,">> When Ethan and Jerri joined our tribe,"
540,00:32:54.77,00:32:54.77,we all agreed that Ethan would be the first to go.
541,00:32:58.53,00:32:58.53,"Now all of a sudden, Lex is coming up to me and Kathy"
542,00:33:01.90,00:33:01.90,and telling us it's Richard. Richard. Richard Hatch.
543,00:33:06.30,00:33:06.30,It's a mistake. I think... it's a mistake.
544,00:33:10.57,00:33:10.57,"If we take Richard out now, who do we have?"
545,00:33:13.00,00:33:13.00,"Just you and me. >> Well, we got to think"
546,00:33:15.73,00:33:15.73,about it some more. I need to think before I react.
547,00:33:18.53,00:33:18.53,We got to think more. >> What do you think
548,00:33:24.20,00:33:24.20,about all this craziness that's going on?
549,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,">> I know. >> I mean, if we vote"
550,00:33:27.90,00:33:27.90,"Colby, I'm in. >> I know you are."
551,00:33:30.40,00:33:30.40,">> I'm trying to convince Kathy that instead of Rich, it's"
552,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,Colby. My own personal reasons.
553,00:33:38.67,00:33:38.67,"Some revenge involved, for sure. I got screwed over by"
554,00:33:42.20,00:33:42.20,Colby once already. >> I totally see it.
555,00:33:44.37,00:33:44.37,">> I mean, worse than you could ever imagine,"
556,00:33:46.80,00:33:46.80,and I would hate to put myself in a position
557,00:33:50.07,00:33:50.07,to repeat the same mistake. >> The only thing that
558,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,"bothered me today with this decision,"
559,00:33:53.83,00:33:53.83,"it wasn't unilateral. You know, Colby didn't come"
560,00:33:55.77,00:33:55.77,to all of us. He just went up there
561,00:33:57.63,00:33:57.63,"and made that decision. >> Yeah, and that's"
562,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,"exactly what I mean. >> I don't know,"
563,00:34:00.97,00:34:00.97,it's a hard call. It's a big move.
564,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,">> Okay, if you start thinking differently,"
565,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97,just let me know. >> I will.
566,00:34:06.77,00:34:06.77,">> I'm on your side. >> Okay, same here."
567,00:34:09.47,00:34:09.47,( laughs ) >> I don't want to fall prey
568,00:34:16.00,00:34:16.00,to the same person who screwed me over in Australia.
569,00:34:29.20,00:34:29.20,">> Time for a Tribal Council, and everything starts"
570,00:34:32.53,00:34:32.53,"going haywire-- it's great. >> See, everything's flushing"
571,00:34:35.13,00:34:35.13,out right now. >> Now Jerri says she's been
572,00:34:37.77,00:34:37.77,approached to get rid of me. The only way that could possibly
573,00:34:42.03,00:34:42.03,"have happened is Ethan, Lex and Colby."
574,00:34:46.50,00:34:46.50,">> I think, if we go in, we vote for Colby, I'm in."
575,00:34:51.40,00:34:51.40,"I'm in 100%. >> Okay, that's it, then."
576,00:34:54.23,00:34:54.23,"'Cause if you're not for anything else,"
577,00:34:55.90,00:34:55.90,"then we'll just do that. All right, Colby goes."
578,00:34:58.53,00:34:58.53,So they blew it. How dare you approach somebody
579,00:35:02.17,00:35:02.17,to get rid of me? You must go bye-bye now.
580,00:35:05.80,00:35:05.80,So Colby has to go home. ( thunder crashing )
581,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,">> Well, Ethan and Lex and Colby feel like they're the strongest"
582,00:35:18.83,00:35:18.83,and will hold the challenges together.
583,00:35:21.07,00:35:21.07,So what do you say-- Colby? You don't know yet?
584,00:35:25.63,00:35:25.63,You're going to let me know when you decide.
585,00:35:27.73,00:35:27.73,>> I know. Give me ten minutes.
586,00:35:29.93,00:35:29.93,>> All right. ( chuckles )
587,00:35:32.57,00:35:32.57,( mimics giggling ) >> Colby and Richard are
588,00:35:40.37,00:35:40.37,"on the chopping block tonight, and I have got myself"
589,00:35:45.33,00:35:45.33,in the middle. I don't know how I got there.
590,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,So do you trust your gut? Do you trust loyalty?
591,00:35:53.37,00:35:53.37,Or do you just go with sort of what makes sense?
592,00:35:58.27,00:35:58.27,And where am I going? I don't know.
593,00:36:30.07,00:36:30.07,>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal Council.
594,00:36:33.40,00:36:33.40,This is the first time the original Mogo Mogo
595,00:36:35.67,00:36:35.67,has had to deal with the task of voting somebody out.
596,00:36:38.40,00:36:38.40,"Before we get to that, let's talk a little bit."
597,00:36:40.70,00:36:40.70,"Going back to the Reward Challenge,"
598,00:36:43.10,00:36:43.10,"Richard, that raft didn't look like"
599,00:36:45.70,00:36:45.70,it was going to make it three feet in the water.
600,00:36:48.00,00:36:48.00,">> Come on, you knew we were going to win as soon as you saw"
601,00:36:50.97,00:36:50.97,that bundle of joy. >> PROBST: That was Bad News
602,00:36:52.93,00:36:52.93,"Bears for sure. As a result, you get"
603,00:36:54.93,00:36:54.93,"two new tribe members. Ethan, you were the first person"
604,00:36:57.23,00:36:57.23,"picked in the school yard ""Pick 'Em. """
605,00:36:59.57,00:36:59.57,"Was your initial instinct, ""Hey, they like me,"""
606,00:37:02.07,00:37:02.07,"or ""Wow, I'm in trouble""? >> A little bit of both."
607,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,"But as you know, you remember that first Tribal Council,"
608,00:37:08.93,00:37:08.93,"my back was against the wall, so I was just happy"
609,00:37:11.70,00:37:11.70,"to have a change of pace and, you know, just get"
610,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,"a new lease on life, really. >> PROBST: Colby, how are you"
611,00:37:18.43,00:37:18.43,"doing second time around? >> I mean, it is"
612,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,a much different experience because everyone
613,00:37:22.47,00:37:22.47,"knows how to play this game, and so you cannot coast, uh,"
614,00:37:26.87,00:37:26.87,although a lot of people are doing it.
615,00:37:30.07,00:37:30.07,">> PROBST: Kathy, how much more difficult is it"
616,00:37:33.97,00:37:33.97,playing with 18 people who are really good
617,00:37:36.27,00:37:36.27,"at this game? >> Oh, it's 100% the other"
618,00:37:39.60,00:37:39.60,direction than when we were playing before.
619,00:37:41.63,00:37:41.63,"There was loyalty the last time, you know, where you'd get"
620,00:37:44.70,00:37:44.70,"friendships and bondings. And, uh, right now"
621,00:37:47.40,00:37:47.40,it's just pure unadulterated playing the game.
622,00:37:52.17,00:37:52.17,">> PROBST: Hatch, how busy was the afternoon back at camp,"
623,00:37:54.57,00:37:54.57,"because it's game on now. For the first time,"
624,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,"you have to vote somebody out. >> Yeah, it's true."
625,00:37:59.57,00:37:59.57,This is our first time somebody's got to go.
626,00:38:01.70,00:38:01.70,"Of course, you know, I have no target on my back."
627,00:38:04.63,00:38:04.63,( blows air thorough lips ) ( Richard chuckles )
628,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,">> PROBST: Colby, what went on at camp this afternoon"
629,00:38:09.57,00:38:09.57,when you got back? It had to be a busy
630,00:38:11.90,00:38:11.90,"afternoon, positioning. >> It was. Yeah, it was."
631,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,It was. It's a hard day when
632,00:38:15.83,00:38:15.83,"you got to go back, and you have a few"
633,00:38:18.13,00:38:18.13,"hours to scramble. Ultimately,"
634,00:38:20.13,00:38:20.13,someone's getting duped. Someone is having the wool
635,00:38:23.07,00:38:23.07,"pulled over their eyes, and... ( chuckles )"
636,00:38:26.07,00:38:26.07,you won't know until that vote goes up whether it's you.
637,00:38:29.57,00:38:29.57,>> PROBST: What are you basing your vote on tonight?
638,00:38:31.80,00:38:31.80,">> Um, cutting out the cancer. >> PROBST: How about for you,"
639,00:38:34.23,00:38:34.23,Kathy? >> Taking the big players
640,00:38:36.80,00:38:36.80,out--taking the power players out.
641,00:38:38.83,00:38:38.83,>> PROBST: Surprised who you're voting for?
642,00:38:41.53,00:38:41.53,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: And with that,"
643,00:38:44.53,00:38:44.53,"it's time to vote. Ethan, you're up."
644,00:39:04.13,00:39:04.13,>> It does come down to this. You really could have trusted
645,00:39:07.93,00:39:07.93,me. I was... I was on your side.
646,00:39:10.90,00:39:10.90,"I know that's hard to believe, but it's true."
647,00:39:29.07,00:39:29.07,">> Hatch, you're a hell of a player and you almost had me"
648,00:39:33.87,00:39:33.87,convinced I can trust you. But my gut told me not to.
649,00:39:36.57,00:39:36.57,I'm not going to. Best of luck.
650,00:39:55.47,00:39:55.47,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
651,00:40:10.80,00:40:10.80,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
652,00:40:13.60,00:40:13.60,The person voted out will be asked to leave the
653,00:40:15.97,00:40:15.97,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
654,00:40:19.47,00:40:19.47,First vote: Colby.
655,00:40:27.10,00:40:27.10,Hatch. Rich.
656,00:40:33.33,00:40:33.33,Two votes: Rich. One vote: Colby.
657,00:40:38.60,00:40:38.60,Hatch. That's three votes: Rich.
658,00:40:41.73,00:40:41.73,One vote: Colby. The fifth person voted out
659,00:40:47.40,00:40:47.40,of Survivor: All-Stars... Rich.
660,00:40:51.73,00:40:51.73,>> I've been bamboozled! >> PROBST: That's four.
661,00:40:53.77,00:40:53.77,That's enough. >> Good on you all.
662,00:40:57.90,00:40:57.90,"Man, oh, man. >> We played it, didn't we?"
663,00:41:02.27,00:41:02.27,">> ( chuckles ): Yeah, you did. >> PROBST: Rich, the tribe"
664,00:41:05.83,00:41:05.83,has spoken. >> Food. Food.
665,00:41:20.67,00:41:20.67,">> PROBST: Well, if tonight's vote showed you one thing,"
666,00:41:23.80,00:41:23.80,it ought to be this: when you are competing
667,00:41:26.43,00:41:26.43,"against players of this caliber in this game,"
668,00:41:29.13,00:41:29.13,"it doesn't matter how good you are,"
669,00:41:31.03,00:41:31.03,"you are always at risk. Grab your torches,"
670,00:41:33.87,00:41:33.87,head back to camp. Good night.

676,00:41:58.17,00:41:58.17,My strategy was pointed out by Colby last night.
677,00:42:00.13,00:42:00.13,Someone like you doesn't have to lie this entire game because
678,00:42:02.77,00:42:02.77,you don't make a decision. I don't have
679,00:42:04.63,00:42:04.63,any respect for that. >> Captain America with his

683,00:42:21.93,00:42:21.93,( laughs ) So much for what I thought.
684,00:42:24.50,00:42:24.50,I'm gone. How much fun is Survivor?
685,00:42:27.93,00:42:27.93,"Yeah, I was blown out of the water today"
686,00:42:30.27,00:42:30.27,and didn't even know it. I've never had my torch snuffed.
687,00:42:32.60,00:42:32.60,"I've never had it put out, and here I am, I'm gone."
688,00:42:35.23,00:42:35.23,"I'm gone. Oh, fifth out of the game."
689,00:42:37.70,00:42:37.70,I wanted the check again. Damn.
