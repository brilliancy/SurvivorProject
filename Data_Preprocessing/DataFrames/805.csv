44,00:03:36.13,00:03:36.13,The biggest part of thechallenge is obviously
45,00:03:38.33,00:03:38.33,building it.>> We'll probably be... here...
46,00:03:53.63,00:03:53.63,to have the two power strokes.You'll be there.
47,00:03:55.90,00:03:55.90,You'll be there.You put two bundles and then
48,00:03:58.83,00:03:58.83,the platform right on it.Then we're making outriggers.
49,00:04:01.60,00:04:01.60,"It's like a big catamaran.>> Apparently, we're building"
50,00:04:04.50,00:04:04.50,"a pontoon boat, a catamaranpossibly-- I'm not sure--"

52,00:04:11.83,00:04:11.83,platform.It sounds great in theory.
53,00:04:15.97,00:04:15.97,I hope it works.I'm a little bit worried
54,00:04:18.70,00:04:18.70,"about building stuff now,ever since our..."
55,00:04:21.17,00:04:21.17,first shelter fiasco.>> I love it.
56,00:04:25.83,00:04:25.83,>> Let's start lashing the topto it.
57,00:04:27.70,00:04:27.70,I feel very good about the raft.I'm trying to not think
58,00:04:30.77,00:04:30.77,"about the house.You know, I got my reputation"
59,00:04:33.43,00:04:33.43,"riding on this damn thing again.>> Okay, guys, we have"
60,00:04:36.83,00:04:36.83,to win this today.We're going to have to paddle
61,00:04:39.10,00:04:39.10,our asses off.>> We came up with a good
62,00:04:41.53,00:04:41.53,"design, and with four paddles,we should be able to fly."
63,00:04:44.03,00:04:44.03,We want to win.>> The key is you got to use
64,00:04:54.47,00:04:54.47,"every blooming piece of bamboo.>> Do you use full length,"
65,00:04:57.37,00:04:57.37,or do you make it shorter?>> Full length.
66,00:04:59.33,00:04:59.33,>> Yeah?>> Why?
67,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,">> 'Cause, you know what?It's too much energy"
68,00:05:03.20,00:05:03.20,"to cut it down.>> It could be very,"
69,00:05:05.37,00:05:05.37,"very, very simple.These bundles, as they are,"
70,00:05:07.97,00:05:07.97,will never sink.Don't think too hard.
71,00:05:10.63,00:05:10.63,Simple is always better.The challenge was
72,00:05:13.47,00:05:13.47,to construct a raft...that was worthy...
73,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,of the seaand could carry four of us.
74,00:05:20.13,00:05:20.13,So that meant this raftnot only had to carry Lex
75,00:05:23.07,00:05:23.07,"and Kathy and Iand a normal human being,"
76,00:05:25.60,00:05:25.60,but it's got to carry260 pounds of Hatch.
77,00:05:29.00,00:05:29.00,>> I think it's good forsteering.
78,00:05:32.10,00:05:32.10,>> Let's kind of go back andforth and see how stable it is.
79,00:05:34.93,00:05:34.93,"But ultimately,it came down to laziness"
80,00:05:37.57,00:05:37.57,"and pure exhaustionthat designed that raft,"
81,00:05:40.43,00:05:40.43,and nothing more.>> The raft will definitely
82,00:05:46.10,00:05:46.10,"float, but it won't be swift.It will not be swift."
83,00:05:56.40,00:05:56.40,>> I'm going to tellyou something.
84,00:05:58.53,00:05:58.53,That raft...That one's going to
85,00:06:03.63,00:06:03.63,win us this challenge.>> I say nice rack...
86,00:06:05.60,00:06:05.60,"Oh, raft.>> Yeah, wait."
87,00:06:09.43,00:06:09.43,"Have you been drinking?>> No. No, I just..."
88,00:06:12.30,00:06:12.30,"I-I meant ""raft""when I said ""rack."""
89,00:06:15.17,00:06:15.17,">> Hey, Tom, I gotyour waterbed for you."
90,00:06:17.80,00:06:17.80,>> All right.>> That's the best built thing
91,00:06:21.30,00:06:21.30,since Alicia.>> If I could vote anybody out
92,00:06:24.60,00:06:24.60,"right now, it'd be Tom.He's a stupid drunk."
93,00:06:28.47,00:06:28.47,A stupid klutzy drunk.I don't care for the man
94,00:06:32.50,00:06:32.50,whatsoever.I don't think his sexual
95,00:06:34.47,00:06:34.47,innuendoes are funny.>> I christen the ship.
96,00:06:39.63,00:06:39.63,>> Tom came down with thewhiskey to christen the vessel.
97,00:06:41.93,00:06:41.93,">> I christen...>> Oh, yeah!"
98,00:06:43.77,00:06:43.77,">> And I'm like, ""Oh, you guys,don't move, I got to pee."""
99,00:06:46.40,00:06:46.40,So I peed right on the raft.So that we decided that I
100,00:06:55.67,00:06:55.67,christened it right there.>> You pissed on it?
101,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,It's supposed to bepure grain liquor.
102,00:07:00.53,00:07:00.53,Kiss my ass.What a hag.
103,00:07:03.87,00:07:03.87,"My God, that's going to makea hole in the driftwood."
104,00:07:06.90,00:07:06.90,That'll rot any wood I know.I'm afraid the ship's
105,00:07:10.53,00:07:10.53,going to sink now.Where did Sue piss?
106,00:07:13.17,00:07:13.17,">> Right here.>> Go, Tom, you do the honors."
107,00:07:15.77,00:07:15.77,>> Okay.>> I christen thee...
108,00:07:17.97,00:07:17.97,">> I christen thee vesselthe Suzie Q., in honor"

523,00:31:32.43,00:31:32.43,"""Hell, yeah, count me in.""But the downside is,"
524,00:31:37.20,00:31:37.20,it doesn't make any sensefor me to team up with
525,00:31:39.67,00:31:39.67,three guys who are then goingto kick my ass
526,00:31:42.60,00:31:42.60,in every challenge afterwards.>> He just took off to go...

536,00:32:17.20,00:32:17.20,"I got to believe you're with me,'cause Ethan would be more"
537,00:32:19.83,00:32:19.83,of a physical threatto you.
538,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,">> When Ethan and Jerrijoined our tribe,"

541,00:33:01.90,00:33:01.90,and telling us it's Richard.Richard. Richard Hatch.
542,00:33:06.30,00:33:06.30,It's a mistake.I think... it's a mistake.
543,00:33:10.57,00:33:10.57,"If we take Richard out now,who do we have?"
544,00:33:13.00,00:33:13.00,"Just you and me.>> Well, we got to think"
545,00:33:15.73,00:33:15.73,about it some more.I need to think before I react.
546,00:33:18.53,00:33:18.53,We got to think more.>> What do you think
547,00:33:24.20,00:33:24.20,about all this crazinessthat's going on?
548,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,">> I know.>> I mean, if we vote"

554,00:33:44.37,00:33:44.37,">> I mean, worse than youcould ever imagine,"
555,00:33:46.80,00:33:46.80,and I would hate to putmyself in a position
556,00:33:50.07,00:33:50.07,to repeat the same mistake.>> The only thing that
557,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,"bothered me todaywith this decision,"
558,00:33:53.83,00:33:53.83,"it wasn't unilateral.You know, Colby didn't come"
559,00:33:55.77,00:33:55.77,to all of us.He just went up there
560,00:33:57.63,00:33:57.63,"and made that decision.>> Yeah, and that's"
561,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,"exactly what I mean.>> I don't know,"
562,00:34:00.97,00:34:00.97,it's a hard call.It's a big move.
563,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,">> Okay, if you startthinking differently,"
