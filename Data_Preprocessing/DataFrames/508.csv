2,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor:
3,00:00:02.60,00:00:02.60, Ambassadors from  both tribes were sent
4,00:00:04.37,00:00:04.37, to assess the two camps.
5,00:00:05.73,00:00:05.73,SHII ANN: This is great.
6,00:00:06.87,00:00:06.87,This is much better than our shelter.
7,00:00:08.37,00:00:08.37,"PROBST: Shii Ann and Clay  visited Chuay Gahn,"
8,00:00:11.13,00:00:11.13, while Helen and Ken  visited Sook Jai.
9,00:00:12.53,00:00:12.53,HELEN: Did you guys build this?
10,00:00:14.40,00:00:14.40,"-KEN: Yes, we did. -Wa-ho!"
11,00:00:16.73,00:00:16.73,PROBST: The two tribes will now live together on one beach.
12,00:00:19.60,00:00:19.60,The question is: which beach are you going to live on?
13,00:00:22.13,00:00:22.13,-Looks like we're going to Chuay Gahn. -Chuay Gahn.
14,00:00:23.60,00:00:23.60,"PROBST: Believing  they had merged, Shii Ann made"
15,00:00:25.50,00:00:25.50, a plan with Chuay Gahn.
16,00:00:27.53,00:00:27.53,I'm working a deal.
17,00:00:28.53,00:00:28.53,I'm voting Penny out.
18,00:00:30.07,00:00:30.07,Don't sink everybody else and yourself
19,00:00:32.33,00:00:32.33,because you're pissed off at one person.
20,00:00:33.97,00:00:33.97," If she does turn,"
21,00:00:35.47,00:00:35.47,"the rest of her life, she'll be considered a rat."
22,00:00:37.23,00:00:37.23,"PROBST:  But at the immunity challenge,"
23,00:00:38.30,00:00:38.30, the survivors got  a big surprise
24,00:00:39.63,00:00:39.63, when they learned  the two tribes had not merged.
25,00:00:42.37,00:00:42.37,"What I said to you guys when you left is,"
26,00:00:45.37,00:00:45.37,two tribes will live together on the same beach.
27,00:00:48.77,00:00:48.77,Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn battled  again for tribal immunity.
28,00:00:52.60,00:00:52.60,-(cheering) -Chuay Gahn wins immunity!
29,00:00:54.90,00:00:54.90," Chuay Gahn won, sending  Sook Jai to Tribal Council,"
30,00:00:57.60,00:00:57.60, where Shii Ann found herself  in the hot seat.
31,00:01:00.33,00:01:00.33,I have already found out that some people
32,00:01:02.37,00:01:02.37,weren't being true to our tribe.
33,00:01:03.57,00:01:03.57,PROBST: Shii Ann tried to target Penny.
34,00:01:06.17,00:01:06.17,"SHII ANN: Penny, you're manipulative."
35,00:01:08.47,00:01:08.47,"I know that that's not a pleasant word,"
36,00:01:10.53,00:01:10.53,but it's the way that you've played the game.
37,00:01:12.77,00:01:12.77,"PROBST:  But when the votes came in,"
38,00:01:13.90,00:01:13.90, it was Shii Ann  who was voted out.
39,00:01:16.10,00:01:16.10," With both tribes living  on the same beach,"
40,00:01:19.70,00:01:19.70, what strategies  will come into play
41,00:01:21.80,00:01:21.80,and who will be voted out next?
42,00:02:34.57,00:02:34.57,TED: I'm not going to bed  until I see
43,00:02:36.10,00:02:36.10,who is here.
44,00:02:37.23,00:02:37.23,"BRIAN: No, I got to see what's up."
45,00:02:39.00,00:02:39.00,Because if Shii Ann is gone...
46,00:02:40.27,00:02:40.27,I got to see who's coming back to our house.
47,00:02:43.33,00:02:43.33,-TED: After we spanked them. -BRIAN: Uh-huh.
48,00:02:44.93,00:02:44.93,TED: You know what I'm saying?
49,00:02:46.17,00:02:46.17,-Yep. -And I can't wait for them to answer
50,00:02:48.10,00:02:48.10,the question when I say... I'm gonna ask them; I'm gonna say:
51,00:02:50.83,00:02:50.83,what made you vote off Erin
52,00:02:53.97,00:02:53.97,or what made you vote off Shii Ann or whatever?
53,00:02:56.27,00:02:56.27,Just to see what their reaction will be.
54,00:02:58.97,00:02:58.97,"There is a lot of tension in their camp, though, isn't there?"
55,00:03:00.83,00:03:00.83,"-There is a lot of tension. -Oh, there is, man."
56,00:03:02.63,00:03:02.63,"Like I said, if they vote off"
57,00:03:04.40,00:03:04.40,Su Yi... Sin Jun... they're not thinking.
58,00:03:08.43,00:03:08.43,-Nope. -Because she-she's a lot more damage than Erin would be.
59,00:03:11.53,00:03:11.53,-So I'll be curious... -They're making an emotional decision.
60,00:03:13.27,00:03:13.27,Correct.
61,00:03:14.27,00:03:14.27,Which will be a mistake.
62,00:03:22.43,00:03:22.43,PENNY: Shii Ann  was plotting against me
63,00:03:24.47,00:03:24.47," to the other tribe, and..."
64,00:03:26.80,00:03:26.80,"I thought she had succeeded and I pretty much, you know,"
65,00:03:29.83,00:03:29.83,had already said my good-byes.
66,00:03:31.77,00:03:31.77,The joke is on her as far as I'm concerned.
67,00:03:34.13,00:03:34.13,I'm still here and she's not.
68,00:03:36.13,00:03:36.13, I couldn't have been happier
69,00:03:37.60,00:03:37.60, to hear that it was tribe  against tribe
70,00:03:40.23,00:03:40.23,"because I knew, with Sook Jai, I was still safe."
71,00:03:43.33,00:03:43.33,We're all four and we're all strong and true.
72,00:03:46.23,00:03:46.23,Let's stay together.
73,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,Let stay true to one another.
74,00:03:48.83,00:03:48.83,"Remember,"
75,00:03:50.07,00:03:50.07,we'll still be competing against this other team
76,00:03:52.67,00:03:52.67,"in future challenges,"
77,00:03:54.50,00:03:54.50,and just know that I love you all...
78,00:03:55.90,00:03:55.90,(overlapping chatter)
79,00:03:57.13,00:03:57.13,"...and I, and I... and thank you all very much"
80,00:03:59.27,00:03:59.27,for keeping me around.
81,00:04:00.80,00:04:00.80,"KEN:  Well, Penny absolutely feels"
82,00:04:01.97,00:04:01.97,"she needs to do damage control,"
83,00:04:03.17,00:04:03.17," and I would, too,  if I were her."
84,00:04:04.73,00:04:04.73,"She is definitely walking on eggshells,"
85,00:04:06.33,00:04:06.33,"but she has been since the second we got here,"
86,00:04:08.93,00:04:08.93," so she has to, she has  to undo the damage"
87,00:04:11.30,00:04:11.30, that's already been done
88,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,and then try to go on from there.
89,00:04:15.50,00:04:15.50,Hey.
90,00:04:16.67,00:04:16.67,"-Oh, hey, guys. -Hey."
91,00:04:18.10,00:04:18.10,"-Honey, we're home. -Hey, y'all, about damn time."
92,00:04:19.33,00:04:19.33,-We're finally back. -My God.
93,00:04:21.63,00:04:21.63,-Is soup on? -Is soup on?
94,00:04:23.73,00:04:23.73,-(overlapping chatter) -I'm so cold.
95,00:04:26.43,00:04:26.43,TED: Got noodles over there.
96,00:04:27.77,00:04:27.77,"Oh, there's noodles?"
97,00:04:30.13,00:04:30.13,"Oh, my God."
98,00:04:31.50,00:04:31.50,"Hey, congratulations, y'all."
99,00:04:33.03,00:04:33.03,Thank you.
100,00:04:34.03,00:04:34.03,"Yeah, you did a good job."
101,00:04:35.73,00:04:35.73,-Who'd we lose? -Shii Ann.
102,00:04:37.60,00:04:37.60,"Shii Ann? Dad gum, like I figured."
103,00:04:40.07,00:04:40.07,(laughter)
104,00:04:41.23,00:04:41.23,TED: What made you guys vote off Shii Ann?
105,00:04:43.20,00:04:43.20,KEN: She kind of threatened us.
106,00:04:44.37,00:04:44.37,Threatened you?
107,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,"Well, she, she seems to claim"
108,00:04:48.43,00:04:48.43,that you guys have a deal with her that
109,00:04:50.83,00:04:50.83,"if we got rid of her, you guys were going"
110,00:04:52.40,00:04:52.40,"to pick us off one by one, so..."
111,00:04:55.37,00:04:55.37,"we didn't like to have a threat like that,"
112,00:04:57.13,00:04:57.13,so we voted her the hell out.
113,00:04:58.57,00:04:58.57,She what?!
114,00:04:59.73,00:04:59.73,She said that you guys and her had a deal.
115,00:05:01.23,00:05:01.23,TED:  They were dead-on
116,00:05:02.60,00:05:02.60," with their accusation,  and I knew that they knew."
117,00:05:05.20,00:05:05.20,"I mean, it's, it's true."
118,00:05:07.40,00:05:07.40,"If Shii Ann would've came over,"
119,00:05:09.50,00:05:09.50,we would've voted Penny off.
120,00:05:11.27,00:05:11.27,That's a hell of a strategy.
121,00:05:12.80,00:05:12.80,-It kind of backfired on her. -Yeah.
122,00:05:14.80,00:05:14.80,That was kind of stupid to say.
123,00:05:16.23,00:05:16.23,"BRIAN: I think it was a little  bit of a, of an act."
124,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17," They kind of knew what was  going on with her, too,"
125,00:05:21.10,00:05:21.10, and they just wanted  to act more surprised 
126,00:05:22.87,00:05:22.87," than they were,  so we kind of knew that."
127,00:05:24.33,00:05:24.33,"And we're all kind of going, ""Okay, uh-huh, whatever."""
128,00:05:28.30,00:05:28.30,"You guys pick us off one at a time, we'll know she was right."
129,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,"-Yep. -CLAY: First off, you guys,"
130,00:05:32.00,00:05:32.00,we got to go play the game.
131,00:05:33.13,00:05:33.13,-Yeah. -We're not a tribe yet.
132,00:05:35.53,00:05:35.53,"Far as we know, we'll do what we did today"
133,00:05:37.33,00:05:37.33,again tomorrow and the next day and the next day.
134,00:05:39.93,00:05:39.93,"KEN: We're in a unique position, because, uh,"
135,00:05:41.90,00:05:41.90,"except for the person voted out tonight, everybody..."
136,00:05:45.30,00:05:45.30,is now part of the jury.
137,00:05:47.47,00:05:47.47,"CLAY: There we go. That, I was just gonna ask that."
138,00:05:49.10,00:05:49.10,So we're all... we're here the rest of...
139,00:05:50.80,00:05:50.80,"-the entire time? -PENNY: Yes, we all are."
140,00:05:56.00,00:05:56.00,"PENNY: Y'all sleep tight, don't let the mosquito bugs bite."
141,00:06:04.47,00:06:04.47,"BRIAN: Of course, when I look  at Sook Jai, I see enemy,"
142,00:06:07.50,00:06:07.50," I see ""other tribe,"" I see  who we've been competing with"
143,00:06:10.37,00:06:10.37," for these last, uh,  so many weeks here."
144,00:06:12.27,00:06:12.27," I can't just, all a sudden,"
145,00:06:13.60,00:06:13.60,"""Oh, great, one happy family, I love you guys. Hello."""
146,00:06:16.17,00:06:16.17,That's not gonna happen.
147,00:06:17.90,00:06:17.90,"They're gonna have to earn that  respect, they're gonna have"
148,00:06:19.87,00:06:19.87," to earn that trust, they're  gonna have to gain my trust."
149,00:06:21.50,00:06:21.50, I'm kind of seeing  who's doing what
150,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00, or who's not doing what  and kind of feeling them out.
151,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17," It's still sort of like  sleeping with the enemy,"
152,00:06:27.33,00:06:27.33, so that's a little bit  of a weird feeling.
153,00:06:46.53,00:06:46.53,-TED: Good morning. -PENNY: How are you?
154,00:06:48.37,00:06:48.37,I'm doing great. How are you doing?
155,00:06:50.23,00:06:50.23,Are you still talking to your family?
156,00:06:52.23,00:06:52.23,-Every morning. Every morning. -Are you still doing it?
157,00:06:54.90,00:06:54.90,Every morning. That's my routine.
158,00:06:56.57,00:06:56.57,"Well, I'm gonna let you stay here, then, till you're done."
159,00:06:59.17,00:06:59.17,-(laughing) -How about that?
160,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83,"-It's okay. -No, that's all right..."
161,00:07:01.90,00:07:01.90,"I mean, you can stop by; it's okay."
162,00:07:03.97,00:07:03.97,PENNY: I just wanted to come and say hello.
163,00:07:05.60,00:07:05.60,"TED: Yeah, yeah, anytime."
164,00:07:07.50,00:07:07.50,"So, uh, when you're ready to do your morning workout,"
165,00:07:09.53,00:07:09.53,"-I'd love to join you. -Okay. Okay, I'll let you know."
166,00:07:11.77,00:07:11.77,-All right. -I'll let you know.
167,00:07:13.00,00:07:13.00,"I'm going to do some yoga, too."
168,00:07:14.43,00:07:14.43,Okay. I'll do it with you.
169,00:07:15.60,00:07:15.60,-Okay. Cool. Cool. -No problem.
170,00:07:22.67,00:07:22.67,-PENNY: I would love a cup of coffee. -Whoo!
171,00:07:24.53,00:07:24.53,"You know, the one thing I miss most"
172,00:07:26.27,00:07:26.27,"-is my cup of coffee in the morning. -I do, too."
173,00:07:28.57,00:07:28.57,I love to wake up to that.
174,00:07:30.17,00:07:30.17,Kind of like stumble in the kitchen
175,00:07:31.37,00:07:31.37,"in the morning, just get that kick in the ass."
176,00:07:32.90,00:07:32.90,"All right, by God, here I come."
177,00:07:34.13,00:07:34.13,"PENNY: Right about now, it's about that time."
178,00:07:35.47,00:07:35.47,"TED: For me, my observation  is it seems like Penny"
179,00:07:38.30,00:07:38.30, is really going out of her way
180,00:07:40.40,00:07:40.40,"to be superly overly nice,"
181,00:07:41.67,00:07:41.67,to the point where it doesn't feel genuine.
182,00:07:45.03,00:07:45.03,It feels... it feels fake.
183,00:07:47.87,00:07:47.87,We were thankful that y'all had a fire for us
184,00:07:50.33,00:07:50.33,-and some soup left. -Yeah. Yeah.
185,00:07:52.50,00:07:52.50,There's a little dirt on your nose.
186,00:07:54.07,00:07:54.07,JAN:  Penny could be a threat
187,00:07:56.50,00:07:56.50," for anybody in this game,  absolutely."
188,00:07:58.50,00:07:58.50," I think she,"
189,00:07:59.70,00:07:59.70," uh, uses being very cute  and very sweet"
190,00:08:03.57,00:08:03.57,"to her advantage in the game, and... why not?"
191,00:08:06.43,00:08:06.43,"It's part of her tools, part of the package."
192,00:08:09.03,00:08:09.03,"CLAY: Y'all, who talks funnier, her or me?"
193,00:08:10.50,00:08:10.50,"""Like"" is ""lahk."""
194,00:08:13.20,00:08:13.20,(laughter)
195,00:08:14.20,00:08:14.20,I'm just glad to know
196,00:08:15.77,00:08:15.77,that I'm not the worst one with the Southern accent out here.
197,00:08:19.10,00:08:19.10,-Right. -His hair's getting light.
198,00:08:20.63,00:08:20.63,It's between you and Jan.
199,00:08:22.20,00:08:22.20,-No...! -Oh...!
200,00:08:23.73,00:08:23.73,CLAY:  Penny is a...
201,00:08:25.73,00:08:25.73,"cute, sweet little girl."
202,00:08:28.03,00:08:28.03, She thinks her looks  and her little talent
203,00:08:30.40,00:08:30.40, can get whatever  she wants out of men.
204,00:08:33.37,00:08:33.37, Well...
205,00:08:35.13,00:08:35.13,"I'm 46, she ain't getting ... from this one."
206,00:08:39.00,00:08:39.00," She has tried to butter me up,"
207,00:08:40.27,00:08:40.27, she has tried  to butter Brian up
208,00:08:42.03,00:08:42.03," and she has tried to  butter Ted up, and every time"
209,00:08:44.03,00:08:44.03," she starts on one of us,"
210,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,we all just kind of cut our eyes over
211,00:08:47.73,00:08:47.73,"and giggle, like, yeah, there's a little bit more"
212,00:08:50.07,00:08:50.07,of that butter that's not working.
213,00:08:52.73,00:08:52.73,TED: Oh!
214,00:08:53.93,00:08:53.93,My God! Let the games begin.
215,00:08:56.30,00:08:56.30,I don't really start till I hear that thing go in the basket.
216,00:09:00.83,00:09:00.83,"I mean, I just want you to know,"
217,00:09:02.87,00:09:02.87,"don't feel pressure, but you know"
218,00:09:04.50,00:09:04.50,how I respond to it.
219,00:09:05.77,00:09:05.77,-JAN: Oh! -(Ted laughs)
220,00:09:07.80,00:09:07.80,"CLAY: Damn, it's pressure."
221,00:09:09.00,00:09:09.00,One more time...
222,00:09:10.43,00:09:10.43,KEN: There's definitely a strategic reason to get along
223,00:09:13.30,00:09:13.30," with these people,  and there's definitely"
224,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,"a strategic reason for those people to get along with us,"
225,00:09:17.97,00:09:17.97,because things change real quick.
226,00:09:20.30,00:09:20.30,"Once I get this, you know it's over, right, Jake?"
227,00:09:24.63,00:09:24.63,"Oh, my God!"
228,00:09:27.90,00:09:27.90,"HELEN: Right now, we're all,  we're all off-center"
229,00:09:29.73,00:09:29.73," with, you know, trying  to predict, but quite frankly,"
230,00:09:32.90,00:09:32.90," this isn't a game  you can predict, so I told"
231,00:09:35.70,00:09:35.70,everybody today I'm becoming Australian.
232,00:09:37.70,00:09:37.70,"I'm just gonna do that ""no worries, mate"" thing, and..."
233,00:09:40.53,00:09:40.53,"-I'm not gonna think about it.  -I'm killing that chicken,"
234,00:09:42.67,00:09:42.67,and I'm getting that chicken bowl.
235,00:09:44.07,00:09:44.07,I figure I helped earn that chicken.
236,00:09:46.20,00:09:46.20,-I can damn sure kill him. -You're right.
237,00:09:49.37,00:09:49.37,JAN: Chicken Snappin' 101.
238,00:09:53.30,00:09:53.30,I see the yellow bananas comin'.
239,00:09:56.53,00:09:56.53,"(indistinct conversation, chicken clucking)"
240,00:09:58.53,00:09:58.53,Is that dessert tonight?
241,00:10:01.07,00:10:01.07,Who wants a really soft one?
242,00:10:02.87,00:10:02.87,JAKE: Here.
243,00:10:04.07,00:10:04.07,(indistinct conversation)
244,00:10:05.97,00:10:05.97,Can I pick somebody to share that with?
245,00:10:07.30,00:10:07.30,"JAKE: Are we sharing these, or, uh..."
246,00:10:09.17,00:10:09.17,"-Uh, no. -Would you like to share?"
247,00:10:10.73,00:10:10.73,There's one for all of us.
248,00:10:12.33,00:10:12.33,"BRIAN: As much as they don't  want to admit it, as much as"
249,00:10:13.93,00:10:13.93," we try not to admit it,"
250,00:10:15.17,00:10:15.17," it's us against them,  simple as that."
251,00:10:16.93,00:10:16.93, Even though we're living together and hanging out and...
252,00:10:19.43,00:10:19.43,"it all looks peachy, there's a lot of phoniness."
253,00:10:22.30,00:10:22.30,"Everyone wants to start picking people off, I can just feel it,"
254,00:10:24.47,00:10:24.47, slowly but surely.
255,00:10:25.57,00:10:25.57, I can feel it.
256,00:10:26.97,00:10:26.97,"I can sme... sense it, I can smell it."
257,00:10:33.17,00:10:33.17,KEN:  The cave smells of urine.
258,00:10:35.47,00:10:35.47, Chuay Gahn 
259,00:10:36.80,00:10:36.80,has been pissing in the front of the cave.
260,00:10:38.87,00:10:38.87,So now the whole cave is starting to smell.
261,00:10:40.97,00:10:40.97, It's the piss cave.  Very nice.
262,00:10:43.20,00:10:43.20,"I'm surprised, with that sun hitting that sand"
263,00:10:45.53,00:10:45.53,"and everything, that it even stinks, so..."
264,00:10:47.57,00:10:47.57,"Well, it doesn't hit the sand; it's right here inside the cave."
265,00:10:50.70,00:10:50.70,JAKE: Why don't they pee out there in the sand?
266,00:10:53.57,00:10:53.57,"I don't know, I didn't do it."
267,00:10:55.17,00:10:55.17," I come here,  I lay down at the front"
268,00:10:57.03,00:10:57.03," of their cave,  and I smell urine."
269,00:10:58.47,00:10:58.47,It's like pissing in your front door.
270,00:10:59.60,00:10:59.60,"You know, you walk in your front door,"
271,00:11:00.90,00:11:00.90,"you close it, ""Honey, I'm home,"
272,00:11:01.90,00:11:01.90,"let me take a piss right here."""
273,00:11:03.83,00:11:03.83, Animals don't even do that.
274,00:11:05.30,00:11:05.30, Animals are genetically...
275,00:11:07.07,00:11:07.07, encoded not to piss  where they eat.
276,00:11:10.50,00:11:10.50, And it's happening here.
277,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,"I-I don't understand it, but..."
278,00:11:13.63,00:11:13.63,"KEN: It stinks, though."
279,00:11:14.93,00:11:14.93,It smells like under the boardwalk in Coney Island.
280,00:11:17.07,00:11:17.07, I do feel like a visitor here.
281,00:11:18.77,00:11:18.77,Personally... I-I don't go around pissing where I sleep.
282,00:11:22.33,00:11:22.33,"They do, and just for that simple fact,"
283,00:11:24.53,00:11:24.53, I can't feel at home here.
284,00:11:25.90,00:11:25.90,He wants to go pee first.
285,00:11:27.67,00:11:27.67,CLAY: There ain't nobody  peeing in the cave.
286,00:11:29.93,00:11:29.93," I mean, it smells like a cave  the whole time I've been here."
287,00:11:33.10,00:11:33.10," I mean, it's nothing like"
288,00:11:34.33,00:11:34.33,"your living room with the candles going,"
289,00:11:35.97,00:11:35.97,that's for damn sure.
290,00:11:37.03,00:11:37.03,But it is a cave.
291,00:11:38.53,00:11:38.53, You can't forget that.
292,00:11:53.90,00:11:53.90,"JAN: Plate washers, let's go, let's go. Chop-chop."
293,00:12:01.23,00:12:01.23,"But it's interest... interesting to me, even after, uh,"
294,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,being out here in the wilderness
295,00:12:05.07,00:12:05.07,"after hundreds of thousands of years, the girls"
296,00:12:07.17,00:12:07.17,"are still doing... are very domesticated,"
297,00:12:08.57,00:12:08.57,"and they enjoy it, which I think is great."
298,00:12:10.67,00:12:10.67,"JAKE: Yeah, 'cause I told 'em I'd be happy to do the dishes."
299,00:12:13.53,00:12:13.53,"BRIAN: Kind of resorts back to,"
300,00:12:14.87,00:12:14.87,"like, the good old days, when the men just ate,"
301,00:12:16.97,00:12:16.97,and the women did all the cooking and cleaning.
302,00:12:19.27,00:12:19.27,-So... -JAKE (laughs): You notice he's saying that
303,00:12:21.30,00:12:21.30,when they're down there.
304,00:12:22.63,00:12:22.63,"BRIAN: Yeah, of course, but it's very interesting."
305,00:12:24.07,00:12:24.07,"I mean, it's a... it's quite an observation."
306,00:12:28.87,00:12:28.87,-So it's four... -HELEN: Four cups of flour
307,00:12:31.30,00:12:31.30,and one cup of sugar.
308,00:12:32.43,00:12:32.43,Only one cup of sugar?
309,00:12:33.57,00:12:33.57,"Yeah, and a little bit of vanilla."
310,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30,"And, uh, my grandmother's caramel recipe--"
311,00:12:36.70,00:12:36.70,"that's pretty good, too. You cut them"
312,00:12:38.23,00:12:38.23,"in these little, you know, squares like this,"
313,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77,and you... then you fold up the wax paper.
314,00:12:41.50,00:12:41.50,-No way I can do that. -Uh-uh.
315,00:12:43.37,00:12:43.37,JAKE: I like every single person  on the other tribe.
316,00:12:45.50,00:12:45.50, The only one  that drives me crazy
317,00:12:47.13,00:12:47.13, is Helen  with the constant recipes.
318,00:12:49.50,00:12:49.50,"You know, I've heard recipes till I'm just green in the face."
319,00:12:52.87,00:12:52.87,Swedish almond bars.
320,00:12:54.50,00:12:54.50,"You start out with your cookie sheet,"
321,00:12:56.00,00:12:56.00,you put the toasted almonds all over the bottom.
322,00:12:57.63,00:12:57.63,"Pour the batter on top. Like, I'll sprinkle raisins"
323,00:12:59.40,00:12:59.40,around on that. I love raisins.
324,00:13:00.50,00:13:00.50,"See, I'm not a big raisin person."
325,00:13:01.77,00:13:01.77,-HELEN: Yeah. -JAKE: My God.
326,00:13:03.77,00:13:03.77," You need, I need to go  somewhere else when she starts"
327,00:13:05.87,00:13:05.87,"that recipe stuff, which is nonstop 24-7."
328,00:13:08.83,00:13:08.83,Cashew butterscotch squares.
329,00:13:10.40,00:13:10.40,"-Ooh, that sounds good. -Ooh, what are those?"
330,00:13:12.23,00:13:12.23,"Same type thing-- pastry on the bottom,"
331,00:13:13.93,00:13:13.93,"and then cashews and butterscotch chips on top,"
332,00:13:15.63,00:13:15.63,and they bake in the oven.
333,00:13:16.93,00:13:16.93,It's-- just is something to cut into squares
334,00:13:18.43,00:13:18.43,and put in people's lunch boxes and stuff.
335,00:13:20.87,00:13:20.87,"-Got-dang, that incessant talk about food... -Yeah."
336,00:13:24.20,00:13:24.20,-and recipes drives me totally wild. -Uh-huh.
337,00:13:26.30,00:13:26.30,That's why I'm more than happy to go out.
338,00:13:28.47,00:13:28.47,-Yakety-yakety-yak. -Helen loves to just talk
339,00:13:30.43,00:13:30.43,-about the same thing. -And it's all food.
340,00:13:32.50,00:13:32.50,"I'm thinking, Jesus, don't you girls ever just be?"
341,00:13:35.37,00:13:35.37,BRIAN:  Jake and I like to get out.
342,00:13:36.83,00:13:36.83, I'm kind of getting  a little bit of cabin fever
343,00:13:38.50,00:13:38.50," or, if they want to call it  out here, a little cave, uh..."
344,00:13:40.60,00:13:40.60,"uh, cave fever."
345,00:13:41.93,00:13:41.93,I'm going stir-cavey.
346,00:13:43.37,00:13:43.37,(thunder crashing)
347,00:13:54.83,00:13:54.83,"JAKE: I'm very careful  with what I tell Brian,"
348,00:13:56.70,00:13:56.70, and I think he's probably  very careful
349,00:13:58.97,00:13:58.97, with what he tells me.
350,00:14:00.30,00:14:00.30,We're still two separate tribes.
351,00:14:07.17,00:14:07.17,Which one of our girls do you think's the best-looking?
352,00:14:10.67,00:14:10.67,"-Oh, out of Penny or Erin? -Yeah."
353,00:14:12.57,00:14:12.57,I think Penny's got a cuter look.
354,00:14:14.53,00:14:14.53,Exotic-looking-- she's... she's a pretty girl.
355,00:14:17.07,00:14:17.07,JAKE:  I'm trying to figure out
356,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67," information from him, like:  who in your tribe"
357,00:14:20.80,00:14:20.80, would you think  should be voted off first?
358,00:14:23.93,00:14:23.93, And he's doing the same thing  to me all the time.
359,00:14:26.23,00:14:26.23," And part of the time,"
360,00:14:27.73,00:14:27.73,"we're telling each other the truth,"
361,00:14:29.40,00:14:29.40,"and part of the time, we're kind of fudging a little bit."
362,00:14:32.07,00:14:32.07,"But, you know, we're building"
363,00:14:33.40,00:14:33.40," a confidence with one another,"
364,00:14:35.27,00:14:35.27," and once that confidence  is built,"
365,00:14:37.27,00:14:37.27, then I think we'll  be able to...
366,00:14:39.30,00:14:39.30,form an alliance of sorts.
367,00:14:42.47,00:14:42.47,"BRIAN: Jake, he might be  picking my brain a little bit,"
368,00:14:44.83,00:14:44.83," but I'm not, uh,  telling him much."
369,00:14:46.93,00:14:46.93,He's always asking a couple questions here
370,00:14:48.37,00:14:48.37,"how I feel about the tribe,"
371,00:14:49.70,00:14:49.70," and he's kind of  feeling me out,"
372,00:14:51.33,00:14:51.33, and I'm not giving him  anything-- at least not yet.
373,00:15:05.37,00:15:05.37,"HELEN: A cup of sugar, half a cup of plain old cocoa."
374,00:15:09.33,00:15:09.33,"You know, cocoa, not mix."
375,00:15:10.70,00:15:10.70,-Mm-hmm. -Cocoa.
376,00:15:12.07,00:15:12.07,"Then you're going to take another cup of sugar,"
377,00:15:13.90,00:15:13.90,and you're going to pour...
378,00:15:15.67,00:15:15.67,Brian-- he's a good guy.
379,00:15:18.03,00:15:18.03,"Yeah, I like him."
380,00:15:19.50,00:15:19.50,I was going to see if you wanted
381,00:15:21.23,00:15:21.23,to try to figure out if we could make
382,00:15:24.63,00:15:24.63,"you and I from this side,"
383,00:15:26.27,00:15:26.27,"and him and Clay from that side, be the final four."
384,00:15:30.37,00:15:30.37,"Well, uh, if you'll leave me alone with him"
385,00:15:33.27,00:15:33.27,"a little bit longer, I might be able to get to that."
386,00:15:35.93,00:15:35.93,-Okay. -I might be able to.
387,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,But... I'm just not sure.
388,00:15:40.93,00:15:40.93,"Yeah, don't be."
389,00:15:42.40,00:15:42.40,Don't believe everything he says.
390,00:15:44.27,00:15:44.27,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm not."
391,00:15:45.60,00:15:45.60,"Just remember, he's a used car dealer."
392,00:15:47.43,00:15:47.43,Mm-hmm.
393,00:15:48.63,00:15:48.63,What do they sell? They sell lemons.
394,00:15:50.30,00:15:50.30,-Mm-hmm. -Be careful.
395,00:16:00.53,00:16:00.53,"JAN: Treemail, children!"
396,00:16:02.90,00:16:02.90,JAKE: Treemail!
397,00:16:04.60,00:16:04.60,You guys are going to go bonkers over this.
398,00:16:06.83,00:16:06.83,-Holy... -What is that?
399,00:16:08.57,00:16:08.57,That looks to me
400,00:16:09.93,00:16:09.93,like the immunity idol in that... inside that...
401,00:16:11.80,00:16:11.80,-Inside. -Looks like a genie
402,00:16:13.77,00:16:13.77,-in a crystal ball. -Wow.
403,00:16:14.80,00:16:14.80,"JAKE: ""How you deal with adversity"
404,00:16:16.87,00:16:16.87,"""will show who copes the best."
405,00:16:19.33,00:16:19.33,"""Anyone can shine when it's easy,"
406,00:16:21.03,00:16:21.03,"""but how do you deal with stress?"
407,00:16:23.63,00:16:23.63,"""No physical strength required, or power from your brain."
408,00:16:27.60,00:16:27.60,"All you need for this one is the desire to win this game."""
409,00:16:31.97,00:16:31.97,Wow.
410,00:16:33.30,00:16:33.30,JAKE:  Sook Jai really needs to win
411,00:16:35.10,00:16:35.10, this immunity challenge bad.
412,00:16:36.63,00:16:36.63," I mean, if we could  possibly win this one,"
413,00:16:39.30,00:16:39.30,that would put us back
414,00:16:40.47,00:16:40.47,on an equal footing with the other tribe.
415,00:16:46.57,00:16:46.57,(screeches)
416,00:17:01.73,00:17:01.73,First things first-- Brian.
417,00:17:05.73,00:17:05.73,Take back the immunity idol.
418,00:17:09.37,00:17:09.37,"Today's challenge is for immunity,"
419,00:17:11.43,00:17:11.43,and it's going to test your ability to remain calm
420,00:17:14.70,00:17:14.70,when your instincts tell you to panic.
421,00:17:17.47,00:17:17.47,We've constructed eight individual bamboo snorkels.
422,00:17:20.70,00:17:20.70,"You'll take a deep breath,"
423,00:17:22.43,00:17:22.43,"go underwater, get your mouth around the snorkel piece,"
424,00:17:25.50,00:17:25.50,blow out the water and then begin normal breathing.
425,00:17:29.60,00:17:29.60,"So, in theory, you should be able"
426,00:17:31.07,00:17:31.07,"to stay down there for a long time,"
427,00:17:32.77,00:17:32.77,"but for some of you, those first few breaths"
428,00:17:36.20,00:17:36.20,are going to be cause for panic.
429,00:17:37.93,00:17:37.93,These snorkels are not traditional snorkels.
430,00:17:40.47,00:17:40.47,They don't have a mouthpiece that has a good snug fit.
431,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,It's a piece of bamboo.
432,00:17:45.23,00:17:45.23,You're going to leak a little.
433,00:17:46.60,00:17:46.60,You're probably going to swallow some salt water.
434,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,"Once you come up for air, you're out."
435,00:17:50.90,00:17:50.90,"Because this is a tribe challenge,"
436,00:17:52.93,00:17:52.93,here's how we'll determine the winner.
437,00:17:54.17,00:17:54.17,We'll take the total cumulative time
438,00:17:56.90,00:17:56.90,for the members of each tribe.
439,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,So every second you're underwater counts.
440,00:18:02.53,00:18:02.53,"Three of your members could come up right away,"
441,00:18:04.40,00:18:04.40,"and if the fourth person stays down long enough,"
442,00:18:06.33,00:18:06.33,you can still win this thing.
443,00:18:07.67,00:18:07.67,"Chuay Gahn, for the first time,"
444,00:18:09.60,00:18:09.60,you have more members than Sook Jai.
445,00:18:11.60,00:18:11.60,You're sitting one person out. Who's sitting out?
446,00:18:13.43,00:18:13.43,-Uh... Helen. -Helen.
447,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,"Helen, take your spot at the front of the boat."
448,00:18:16.97,00:18:16.97,"Everybody else, take your positions."
449,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,Wait for my go.
450,00:18:22.13,00:18:22.13,Swim on out and take your spot.
451,00:18:30.07,00:18:30.07,This challenge could last hours; could be over in minutes.
452,00:18:33.70,00:18:33.70,All depends on how you handle stress.
453,00:18:36.73,00:18:36.73,"Here we go, guys. For immunity."
454,00:18:39.07,00:18:39.07,"Three, two, one."
455,00:18:41.97,00:18:41.97,Down.
456,00:19:11.67,00:19:11.67,Penny's first up at nine seconds.
457,00:19:19.87,00:19:19.87,"(wheezes, coughs)"
458,00:19:21.67,00:19:21.67,"Ken, you're up at 15 seconds."
459,00:19:23.97,00:19:23.97,(coughs)
460,00:19:25.13,00:19:25.13,Everybody for Chuay Gahn still down.
461,00:19:38.37,00:19:38.37,"Clay, 20 seconds."
462,00:19:41.00,00:19:41.00,"-Ted, you're at 21. -Damn!"
463,00:19:42.53,00:19:42.53,"Jan, you're at 23."
464,00:19:44.50,00:19:44.50,"Wow, that was fast, guys."
465,00:19:46.97,00:19:46.97,"Erin, up at 25 seconds."
466,00:19:51.07,00:19:51.07,Only two people left in the water:
467,00:19:53.07,00:19:53.07,"Brian for Chuay Gahn, Jake for Sook Jai."
468,00:19:56.00,00:19:56.00,"Here's where we're at, guys."
469,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,Chuay Gahn has 64 seconds underwater.
470,00:19:59.63,00:19:59.63,Sook Jai has 49 seconds underwater.
471,00:20:02.23,00:20:02.23,That's a 15-second lead for Chuay Gahn.
472,00:20:06.07,00:20:06.07,The only way Sook Jai can win is if Jake
473,00:20:08.50,00:20:08.50,stays under the water 16 seconds longer than Brian.
474,00:20:12.33,00:20:12.33,"Jake comes up first, Chuay Gahn wins immunity."
475,00:20:50.77,00:20:50.77,PROBST: Jake is up.
476,00:20:52.73,00:20:52.73,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
477,00:20:54.50,00:20:54.50,"Clay, go let him know."
478,00:20:58.37,00:20:58.37,CLAY: We got it. We got it.
479,00:20:59.63,00:20:59.63,We won. You got it.
480,00:21:00.67,00:21:00.67,"Yo, B, get out now."
481,00:21:04.10,00:21:04.10,CLAY: You got it.
482,00:21:13.50,00:21:13.50,PROBST: Who wants this?
483,00:21:15.00,00:21:15.00,-Brian! -Brian!
484,00:21:16.33,00:21:16.33,"PROBST: Nice work, Brian."
485,00:21:17.57,00:21:17.57,-I'll take that. -You earned it.
486,00:21:18.97,00:21:18.97,Another three days.
487,00:21:20.30,00:21:20.30,You guys are on a hot streak. Congratulations.
488,00:21:22.93,00:21:22.93,"Guys, I hate to be the messenger of more bad news,"
489,00:21:25.73,00:21:25.73,"but another day together at Tribal Council,"
490,00:21:28.00,00:21:28.00,another member of Sook Jai voted out.
491,00:21:31.03,00:21:31.03,Need you to swim off to the beach.
492,00:22:01.57,00:22:01.57,(clattering)
493,00:22:05.57,00:22:05.57,(rummaging)
494,00:22:21.33,00:22:21.33,Got some food waiting for us?
495,00:22:24.37,00:22:24.37,"I'm hungry, y'all."
496,00:22:25.83,00:22:25.83,"I'm telling you, I am hungry."
497,00:22:27.43,00:22:27.43,"Get out, before you come back, you're just hungry."
498,00:22:29.93,00:22:29.93,"It's like, it's like leaving the house."
499,00:22:31.60,00:22:31.60,"-You're just hungry, period, you know? -Yeah."
500,00:22:33.80,00:22:33.80,Let's get some wood on this fire.
501,00:22:40.60,00:22:40.60,Is there any reason why the lid is off our noodles?
502,00:22:45.07,00:22:45.07,"You're kidding me, right?"
503,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,No.
504,00:22:47.93,00:22:47.93,"Like, then they're dumped out on the floor."
505,00:22:50.70,00:22:50.70,Here.
506,00:22:54.33,00:22:54.33,No. He opened the lid and got into the real stuff.
507,00:22:57.90,00:22:57.90,Who?
508,00:22:59.50,00:22:59.50,"-The monkey. -Oh, no."
509,00:23:01.90,00:23:01.90,Did he knock it again?
510,00:23:04.77,00:23:04.77,All the bananas that were saved for tonight are gone.
511,00:23:07.43,00:23:07.43,No way!
512,00:23:08.70,00:23:08.70,"That's who knocked over our, um... that's..."
513,00:23:10.93,00:23:10.93,"Well, I did think that that was a possibility."
514,00:23:14.93,00:23:14.93,He came in here messing around.
515,00:23:16.23,00:23:16.23,They must be bringing the whole family down here.
516,00:23:18.03,00:23:18.03,"-Yeah, he scouted out the area... -Oh, big-time."
517,00:23:19.67,00:23:19.67,The chicken feed was in...
518,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,"they-they got into the chicken feed, too."
519,00:23:23.07,00:23:23.07,-They got into it? -The chicken's gone.
520,00:23:24.80,00:23:24.80,-The chicken's gone? -No!
521,00:23:26.53,00:23:26.53,"No, just the chicken feed."
522,00:23:28.10,00:23:28.10,"Oh, oh, oh, oh... oh, oh, oh, oh, oh..."
523,00:23:31.00,00:23:31.00,"HELEN: Our monkey visitor  again has, um,"
524,00:23:32.97,00:23:32.97," invaded the camp, and, uh..."
525,00:23:35.90,00:23:35.90,he ate the bananas that we had left for tonight
526,00:23:39.33,00:23:39.33,that were just perfectly ripe.
527,00:23:41.77,00:23:41.77,Damn monkey-- I swear I'm going to kill him if I get him.
528,00:23:45.00,00:23:45.00, And then he got  into our noodles.
529,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43," I mean, my God, that...  that's it."
530,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87, That's our food here.
531,00:23:49.27,00:23:49.27, I have real doubts  that it's going to last us
532,00:23:51.77,00:23:51.77," the next  two and a half weeks, anyway."
533,00:23:53.47,00:23:53.47, With monkey claws in there
534,00:23:54.80,00:23:54.80," taking them out, uh,  it's not going to last."
535,00:23:57.03,00:23:57.03, -It-it's just not.  -We got to eat.
536,00:23:58.53,00:23:58.53,Thank you. That's... that's good enough.
537,00:24:00.40,00:24:00.40,-That's perfect. -HELEN: If he takes our...
538,00:24:01.87,00:24:01.87,"if he takes our noodles, we are up the creek without a paddle."
539,00:24:05.20,00:24:05.20,"We'll be eating rocks or something, so..."
540,00:24:16.17,00:24:16.17,If I'd have blown that water out...
541,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,You got one shot at it.
542,00:24:20.17,00:24:20.17,-Yeah. -You didn't get it the first time.
543,00:24:21.80,00:24:21.80,"-You didn't have enough oxygen to get the thrust, -Uh-uh."
544,00:24:24.73,00:24:24.73,because of the...
545,00:24:29.03,00:24:29.03,JAKE: It's... it's really hard  on me today
546,00:24:31.33,00:24:31.33, 'cause I'm taking this one  really personal.
547,00:24:33.37,00:24:33.37, I feel totally responsible  for the fact
548,00:24:36.23,00:24:36.23, that we're going back  to Tribal Council.
549,00:24:38.77,00:24:38.77, What I'd rather do  is just go off somewhere
550,00:24:40.63,00:24:40.63, and just be by myself
551,00:24:42.30,00:24:42.30,"and act... you know, just be pissed off."
552,00:24:46.53,00:24:46.53, But you can't do that.
553,00:24:47.87,00:24:47.87," I mean, you came back here  with the winners."
554,00:24:49.40,00:24:49.40, They're the winners.  You got to congratulate them.
555,00:24:51.07,00:24:51.07, You got to try not  to berate yourself so bad
556,00:24:54.63,00:24:54.63," in front of them, even though"
557,00:24:56.50,00:24:56.50,"it's happening underneath the core,"
558,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40,"you know, where you're just saying,"
559,00:24:59.97,00:24:59.97,"""Why did you do that?"
560,00:25:01.60,00:25:01.60,"Why did it happen that way today?"""
561,00:25:04.00,00:25:04.00,"Win some, you lose some."
562,00:25:05.63,00:25:05.63,"It sucks, but you know what?"
563,00:25:07.37,00:25:07.37,(Jake sniffles)
564,00:25:08.70,00:25:08.70,W-Well... we can't go back and change it.
565,00:25:11.17,00:25:11.17,I wish I could.
566,00:25:12.87,00:25:12.87,"I... I wish I could, too."
567,00:25:15.13,00:25:15.13,"This is how our fate is determined, okay?"
568,00:25:18.37,00:25:18.37,"And we're a team, and we said that"
569,00:25:20.97,00:25:20.97,we were going to rebuild ourselves after all...
570,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,all that crap with Shii Ann.
571,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,"We have rebuilt ourselves, but you know what?"
572,00:25:26.87,00:25:26.87,We knew that this day was going to come.
573,00:25:28.90,00:25:28.90,We knew we were going to have to start
574,00:25:30.77,00:25:30.77,voting out people that we didn't want to.
575,00:25:34.77,00:25:34.77,"And it sucks, but you know what?"
576,00:25:36.27,00:25:36.27,You got to be strong in your heart.
577,00:25:40.50,00:25:40.50,Thanks.
578,00:25:41.83,00:25:41.83,And I don't blame you.
579,00:25:42.93,00:25:42.93,Penny doesn't blame you.
580,00:25:43.97,00:25:43.97,Ken doesn't blame you.
581,00:25:45.10,00:25:45.10,None of us blame you.
582,00:25:46.23,00:25:46.23,It's part of the game.
583,00:25:47.60,00:25:47.60,Okay.
584,00:25:49.33,00:25:49.33,It is not your fault.
585,00:25:51.13,00:25:51.13,-Okay. -Okay?
586,00:25:52.57,00:25:52.57,"You believe me, okay?"
587,00:25:53.93,00:25:53.93,Okay.
588,00:26:00.00,00:26:00.00,(Jake sniffling)
589,00:26:12.47,00:26:12.47,"BRIAN: Well, we had another, uh, immunity challenge and, um,"
590,00:26:16.07,00:26:16.07," it's still  kind of weird, though,"
591,00:26:17.73,00:26:17.73, winning and then having  to come back
592,00:26:19.40,00:26:19.40, and not really being able  to celebrate a win.
593,00:26:21.63,00:26:21.63," So you're not  looking too, uh... uh..."
594,00:26:23.70,00:26:23.70,"uh, happy, because they've got"
595,00:26:25.40,00:26:25.40,"a major, disappointing decision to make."
596,00:26:27.23,00:26:27.23,So that's a very strange feeling.
597,00:26:29.10,00:26:29.10,-It's not a fun win. -It's like a bittersweet...
598,00:26:30.57,00:26:30.57,"a bittersweet victory, you know what I mean?"
599,00:26:32.17,00:26:32.17,"-I think we're both cheated in some way. -I know, 'cause I"
600,00:26:34.07,00:26:34.07,don't want to say good-bye to any of you guys.
601,00:26:35.70,00:26:35.70,And we're cheated... we're cheated
602,00:26:36.90,00:26:36.90,because we can't really fully enjoy our win.
603,00:26:39.77,00:26:39.77,-Right? -Right.
604,00:26:40.93,00:26:40.93,Because we kind of like you guys. You-you...
605,00:26:43.90,00:26:43.90,-you're living with us. -It's sad.
606,00:26:45.10,00:26:45.10,"You know, you guys"
607,00:26:46.30,00:26:46.30,"obviously can't be happy, really, for us,"
608,00:26:48.17,00:26:48.17,because of the decision
609,00:26:49.87,00:26:49.87,that has to be made and stuff like that.
610,00:26:52.17,00:26:52.17,So... this... this is a weird way of feeling.
611,00:26:54.73,00:26:54.73,You want to jump and holler and...
612,00:26:56.43,00:26:56.43,"and scream, but you can't, because,"
613,00:26:58.07,00:26:58.07," you know, the people living  with you that you just beat."
614,00:27:00.37,00:27:00.37, And you don't want  to rub it in their face
615,00:27:02.17,00:27:02.17," 'cause, you know,  that can hurt you later on"
616,00:27:03.97,00:27:03.97," if one of them's on the jury.  But yet,"
617,00:27:05.73,00:27:05.73," they were sad,  but trying to be happy for us."
618,00:27:07.33,00:27:07.33," And that's why we're just  having to tell them,"
619,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40," ""Oh, we're so sorry  y'all got to go"
620,00:27:10.83,00:27:10.83,"to Tribal Council tonight,"""
621,00:27:12.07,00:27:12.07,"but we were so damn happy, it was unbelievable."
622,00:27:14.90,00:27:14.90,"...we don't leave anything out, too-- no coconut out, nothing."
623,00:27:16.97,00:27:16.97,"PENNY: This is the first time,  I think,"
624,00:27:18.77,00:27:18.77, we've really actually  been able to talk
625,00:27:21.83,00:27:21.83," about how we're all feeling,  because..."
626,00:27:23.67,00:27:23.67, now you've got four people  who are pissed off
627,00:27:25.93,00:27:25.93,"that we didn't win, and you've got five happy people"
628,00:27:28.73,00:27:28.73,who can't talk about how badly they just kicked our butts.
629,00:27:32.80,00:27:32.80," And when you're losing  all the time against them,"
630,00:27:35.30,00:27:35.30, it's hard to stay upbeat
631,00:27:37.30,00:27:37.30, and keep your mind  off the game.
632,00:27:44.87,00:27:44.87,JAKE: My personal opinion is we ought to cook the chicken.
633,00:27:47.87,00:27:47.87,"Mine, too."
634,00:27:49.90,00:27:49.90,"I mean, they're going to share it with us anyway,"
635,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,but at least...
636,00:27:53.77,00:27:53.77,lets who brought it into camp get a chance to eat it.
637,00:27:56.47,00:27:56.47,-Together. -Yeah.
638,00:27:58.70,00:27:58.70,That's fine by me-- whatever you guys want to do.
639,00:28:02.20,00:28:02.20,This was supposed to have been the final four. (laughs)
640,00:28:05.27,00:28:05.27,"Well, it is the final four."
641,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,(laughing): In our tribe.
642,00:28:09.00,00:28:09.00,It's the final four out of the final nine.
643,00:28:12.40,00:28:12.40,"Don't take it to heart, Pops."
644,00:28:14.67,00:28:14.67,"Well, thanks."
645,00:28:16.07,00:28:16.07,"I mean, look, we... this is our fourth time"
646,00:28:18.03,00:28:18.03,in a row to go to Tribal Council.
647,00:28:20.87,00:28:20.87,They haven't been the last four times.
648,00:28:23.20,00:28:23.20,"So if I'm not here, I want you three to kick some ass"
649,00:28:27.53,00:28:27.53,and make them go to Tribal Council.
650,00:28:29.17,00:28:29.17,I feel exactly the same way.
651,00:28:30.87,00:28:30.87,"I mean, who knows where this game's going to go?"
652,00:28:33.40,00:28:33.40,The only thing I know is this is our last time
653,00:28:35.80,00:28:35.80,"for the four of us to be together, and I hate that."
654,00:28:38.77,00:28:38.77,Maybe the four of us should sleep together tonight.
655,00:28:45.73,00:28:45.73,That sounds almost... erotic.
656,00:28:48.70,00:28:48.70,(laughs)
657,00:28:50.03,00:28:50.03,I'm kidding.
658,00:28:53.27,00:28:53.27,"Well, it's got to be..."
659,00:28:54.70,00:28:54.70,"you know, it's going to get tricky."
660,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,Let me keep my relationship with Brian.
661,00:28:59.40,00:28:59.40,"And I'm trying to develop one with Clay,"
662,00:29:01.83,00:29:01.83,so let me try to keep them.
663,00:29:03.73,00:29:03.73,Y'all develop them how... how you can.
664,00:29:05.93,00:29:05.93,"Whatever we do from this point forward,"
665,00:29:08.67,00:29:08.67,just... just remember that's where it is.
666,00:29:11.50,00:29:11.50,No matter what happens.
667,00:29:15.13,00:29:15.13,And no matter what it looks like...
668,00:29:18.67,00:29:18.67,...our team's loyal.
669,00:29:21.20,00:29:21.20,We're loyal.
670,00:29:35.33,00:29:35.33,"All right, we're going to say a few words about this chicken."
671,00:29:39.30,00:29:39.30,"This is Lucky, who's been with us a number of days."
672,00:29:44.50,00:29:44.50,TED:  I didn't grow up on a farm.
673,00:29:46.23,00:29:46.23, I'm not a hunter.
674,00:29:47.87,00:29:47.87," You know, I really didn't want  to see the process"
675,00:29:50.40,00:29:50.40," of, uh, bringing Lucky  to the dinner table..."
676,00:29:52.90,00:29:52.90,because I was basically looking at Lucky as... as a pet.
677,00:29:55.67,00:29:55.67," And if it was up to me,  I would let Lucky go free."
678,00:29:58.80,00:29:58.80,"You know, in, uh, Buddhist philosophy, the Dalai Lama--"
679,00:30:02.43,00:30:02.43,"he said, ""This chicken's darma"
680,00:30:05.13,00:30:05.13,"is to give sustenance to the rest of us."""
681,00:30:09.07,00:30:09.07,"CLAY: You know,  I was raised around farms"
682,00:30:10.50,00:30:10.50," and-and ranches, and..."
683,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,I've never seen such a ceremony
684,00:30:13.57,00:30:13.57,over killing a damn chicken in my life.
685,00:30:15.73,00:30:15.73," There's animals put on here  for us to eat,"
686,00:30:17.73,00:30:17.73," and, uh...  hell, kill 'em and eat 'em."
687,00:30:19.53,00:30:19.53,It's not that big a deal.
688,00:30:21.27,00:30:21.27,"The chicken eats the grain, and then we eat the chicken,"
689,00:30:25.43,00:30:25.43,"so with that, we say to this chicken,"
690,00:30:28.60,00:30:28.60,thank you for giving your life.
691,00:30:29.93,00:30:29.93,And we should have a prayer of thanksgiving
692,00:30:33.53,00:30:33.53,at the time we actually eat the chicken today.
693,00:30:37.30,00:30:37.30,"So, chicken, thank you for giving your life."
694,00:30:40.23,00:30:40.23,(snapping)
695,00:30:46.80,00:30:46.80,(chicken flapping)
696,00:30:48.47,00:30:48.47,(snapping)
697,00:30:52.03,00:30:52.03,(rapid flapping)
698,00:31:00.30,00:31:00.30,"Now, that's just the last-minute muscle twitches of death."
699,00:31:03.70,00:31:03.70,JAN:  I had never participated
700,00:31:05.33,00:31:05.33,"in wringing a chicken's neck,"
701,00:31:08.30,00:31:08.30," and holding the legs  and watching it flap,"
702,00:31:10.83,00:31:10.83," which was very hard for me 'cause I'm very tender-hearted,"
703,00:31:13.97,00:31:13.97,"but it had a purpose, and the purpose was to feed us,"
704,00:31:16.90,00:31:16.90,so it was not a senseless death.
705,00:31:20.27,00:31:20.27,-Can I take these? -Sure.
706,00:31:26.20,00:31:26.20,(sniffling)
707,00:31:27.77,00:31:27.77,"Um, I'm burying Lucky's head and feet"
708,00:31:31.53,00:31:31.53,in my little pet cemetery.
709,00:31:33.90,00:31:33.90,"JAN:  I have a pet cemetery here,"
710,00:31:36.73,00:31:36.73," and it started with Oliver,  the little bat that I found,"
711,00:31:39.60,00:31:39.60,"and then, today, I added, uh..."
712,00:31:41.10,00:31:41.10,"uh, Lucky's head and Lucky's feet."
713,00:31:43.27,00:31:43.27,I'll put them right here by Oliver so they can be friends.
714,00:31:46.60,00:31:46.60,"Of course, my team thinks I'm crazy, but that's okay."
715,00:31:50.40,00:31:50.40,(sniffles)
716,00:31:51.57,00:31:51.57,Didn't know my cemetery would be so active
717,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,"while I was here, but it has been."
718,00:31:55.73,00:31:55.73," It was just to say  thank you and, you know,"
719,00:31:59.10,00:31:59.10," ""Y'all look after each other."""
720,00:32:00.53,00:32:00.53," And so, of course,  that did make me cry,"
721,00:32:03.30,00:32:03.30,but I'm happy they're together.
722,00:32:04.93,00:32:04.93,"(sniffles) Okay, good luck."
723,00:32:06.97,00:32:06.97,There's more meat on here
724,00:32:08.20,00:32:08.20,than I thought there was going to be.
725,00:32:09.97,00:32:09.97,"Oh, my God, that smells so good."
726,00:32:12.67,00:32:12.67,That broth is out of this world.
727,00:32:13.87,00:32:13.87,"Oh, yeah."
728,00:32:15.07,00:32:15.07,"Man, Lucky really tastes good."
729,00:32:17.87,00:32:17.87,"Thank you, Lucky."
730,00:32:19.03,00:32:19.03,I got a kiss from Clay Jordan.
731,00:32:20.70,00:32:20.70,"Oh, my God, am I queen for a day."
732,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90,"-Mmm. -No doubt. -We might even have supper here, guys."
733,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,"'Cause, you know, if you guys are going"
734,00:32:26.73,00:32:26.73,"to Tribal Council, you're getting back late."
735,00:32:28.33,00:32:28.33,You can either eat before you go or eat when you get back.
736,00:32:38.10,00:32:38.10,(thunder rumbling)
737,00:32:43.47,00:32:43.47,"Oops. I forgot to yell, ""Fore."""
738,00:32:48.53,00:32:48.53,"Here we are, the final four of Sook Jai."
739,00:32:51.87,00:32:51.87,Somebody's got to go.
740,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,Nobody wants anybody to go.
741,00:32:56.60,00:32:56.60,"Now, do we want to go ahead and reveal who's going tonight,"
742,00:33:01.70,00:33:01.70,or had you rather just do it at the Tribal Council?
743,00:33:10.03,00:33:10.03,ERIN: It makes me sick thinking about this.
744,00:33:12.97,00:33:12.97,It makes us all sick thinking about it.
745,00:33:14.63,00:33:14.63,"I mean, look how far we've come together."
746,00:33:16.53,00:33:16.53,"24 days, and we've all been so close."
747,00:33:21.80,00:33:21.80,"This is the real, true, hard one"
748,00:33:24.90,00:33:24.90,"-because I love all you guys. -Oh, God."
749,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,"-I love y'all, too. -I love all y'all, too."
750,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,I'll-I'll tell you... I'll tell you...
751,00:33:28.80,00:33:28.80,"-anyone of you wants to know. -I love all of you, too."
752,00:33:30.97,00:33:30.97,Wouldn't you know it'd start raining when we get
753,00:33:32.70,00:33:32.70,"-right here, huh? -Good Lord's crying with us."
754,00:33:35.13,00:33:35.13,"Yeah, he is crying with us."
755,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,"Yo, let's get in out of the rain,"
756,00:33:39.00,00:33:39.00,'cause we're going to be freezing later.
757,00:33:52.03,00:33:52.03,"JAKE: If it was you, would you want to know?"
758,00:33:53.90,00:33:53.90,I think I'd want to know
759,00:33:56.53,00:33:56.53,'cause I wouldn't want to be shocked.
760,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,-How about you? -I don't know how I feel.
761,00:34:03.43,00:34:03.43,How about you?
762,00:34:04.93,00:34:04.93,I would only want to know if everybody's
763,00:34:06.93,00:34:06.93,in agreement that that's what we're going to do.
764,00:34:09.47,00:34:09.47,It's got to be unanimous-- that's how...
765,00:34:10.97,00:34:10.97,that's how I feel about stuff like this.
766,00:34:12.90,00:34:12.90,"PENNY: Well, let's just save it for Tribal Council, then."
767,00:34:16.33,00:34:16.33,Yeah.
768,00:34:18.37,00:34:18.37,Is that the way we're going to do it?
769,00:34:20.50,00:34:20.50,"Tribal Council, we'll just find out?"
770,00:34:23.27,00:34:23.27,All right.
771,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,"-All right. -God, I love you guys."
772,00:34:26.73,00:34:26.73,"-I love you guys, too. -Love you, too."
773,00:34:29.73,00:34:29.73,"You're special, special, special people."
774,00:34:36.50,00:34:36.50,"Oh, it just sucks 'cause this is the fourth time"
775,00:34:38.83,00:34:38.83,in a row that we're going.
776,00:34:41.63,00:34:41.63,"You know, you'd like to see them have to experience this."
777,00:34:44.80,00:34:44.80,JAKE:  It's tough
778,00:34:46.50,00:34:46.50,when you have to vote somebody off that you love...
779,00:34:50.80,00:34:50.80,and you've been through a lot of stuff with.
780,00:34:52.97,00:34:52.97,And all of us feel that way.
781,00:34:54.93,00:34:54.93,Every one of us. Every last one of us.
782,00:35:00.23,00:35:00.23,Thank you very much.
783,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,"-Hey, guys. -We'll see each other soon."
784,00:35:04.90,00:35:04.90,-Good luck. -Thanks.
785,00:35:06.87,00:35:06.87,"Good luck, Erin. All right?"
786,00:35:08.93,00:35:08.93,Good luck.
787,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,-No shame. -Okay.
788,00:35:13.10,00:35:13.10,See you a little later.
789,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,"Good luck, everybody."
790,00:35:15.77,00:35:15.77,Very nice meeting every single one of you.
791,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50,KEN:  I kind of laughed to myself.
792,00:35:19.30,00:35:19.30,"This is a game, and I'm fighting back tears?"
793,00:35:21.90,00:35:21.90, I used to compare this  to Monopoly.
794,00:35:23.63,00:35:23.63, This is nothing like Monopoly.
795,00:35:25.00,00:35:25.00, This is amazing.
796,00:35:26.30,00:35:26.30,-See you guys later. -See you guys.
797,00:35:28.87,00:35:28.87,"-Bye, guys. -Bye, Erin."
798,00:35:30.50,00:35:30.50,"-Bye, y'all. -Later."
799,00:35:31.87,00:35:31.87,"Bye, Penny. Bye, Jake."
800,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,-(sniffling) -Get this nice little group hug here.
801,00:35:45.40,00:35:45.40,"JAKE: Oh, you girls told me not to do that."
802,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47,(chuckling): I know.
803,00:35:49.47,00:35:49.47,I'm sorry.
804,00:35:51.83,00:35:51.83,TED:  I do feel sad for Sook Jai.
805,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00," You know, at first,"
806,00:35:56.20,00:35:56.20,"we were like, ""Well, hey, you know,"
807,00:35:58.40,00:35:58.40,"they're our competitors. It doesn't make any difference."""
808,00:36:01.23,00:36:01.23," But, you know,  after living with them"
809,00:36:02.67,00:36:02.67,and getting to know them and...
810,00:36:04.07,00:36:04.07, it is a sad reality  that one of them has to go.
811,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,"Welcome, guys."
812,00:36:26.67,00:36:26.67,I want to start first just by checking in on
813,00:36:29.43,00:36:29.43,what it's like back at camp.
814,00:36:31.73,00:36:31.73,I'm wondering if you're starting to feel
815,00:36:33.73,00:36:33.73,"more like visitors, maybe, than residents."
816,00:36:36.50,00:36:36.50,Ken?
817,00:36:37.90,00:36:37.90,"Actually, it's quite the opposite: I feel more at home."
818,00:36:40.90,00:36:40.90,"Uh, each day that passes, I think that the, uh..."
819,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,the Chuay Gahn tribe has been very gracious.
820,00:36:46.07,00:36:46.07,They've just been phenomenal.
821,00:36:47.43,00:36:47.43,"They've accepted us into their... into their home,"
822,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"and now it's our home. We're family,"
823,00:36:52.10,00:36:52.10,"and then, when we leave to compete, we compete."
824,00:36:54.07,00:36:54.07,And it's-it's-it's... it's amazing
825,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,'cause it humanizes the whole game
826,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,because now this person who I'm talking to
827,00:37:00.57,00:37:00.57,"and laughing with and singing with right now,"
828,00:37:03.53,00:37:03.53,I know I'm going to be competing against tomorrow.
829,00:37:06.40,00:37:06.40,Erin... diplomatic answer.
830,00:37:08.17,00:37:08.17,A little hard for me to believe that there's not
831,00:37:10.83,00:37:10.83,some feeling of... of weirdness
832,00:37:13.83,00:37:13.83,in a game that is often controlled by numbers.
833,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,-What's it like for you? -We do feel
834,00:37:19.27,00:37:19.27,"like a large family, but the number game"
835,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,is really starting to catch up with us.
836,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,"For the majority of the game,"
837,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,"we have had, uh, strength in numbers."
838,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,"Now we're the underdogs,"
839,00:37:29.33,00:37:29.33,"and Chuay Gahn does have an advantage over us,"
840,00:37:31.57,00:37:31.57,but they don't make us feel that way.
841,00:37:33.30,00:37:33.30,"Leaving for Tribal Council tonight, they all walked us out."
842,00:37:35.37,00:37:35.37,They knew it was one of the hardest things
843,00:37:37.23,00:37:37.23,that we've had to do.
844,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,"They walked us out, gave us big hugs,"
845,00:37:40.97,00:37:40.97,"told us all good luck and, uh,"
846,00:37:43.63,00:37:43.63,"you know, waved to us good-bye."
847,00:37:46.07,00:37:46.07,"Penny, what's the impact"
848,00:37:47.50,00:37:47.50,in terms of roles or working around camp?
849,00:37:50.53,00:37:50.53,"Is there any feeling in the back of your mind that,"
850,00:37:53.33,00:37:53.33,"""I've got to work with these guys a little bit"
851,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,"because I may need them later in this game?"""
852,00:37:59.10,00:37:59.10,I definitely think so.
853,00:38:00.43,00:38:00.43,"Um, the first couple of days, we were like visitors."
854,00:38:03.47,00:38:03.47,It was like being guests in someone's home.
855,00:38:06.07,00:38:06.07,You had to kind of learn how they do their chores.
856,00:38:08.63,00:38:08.63,How do they sleep? How do they eat?
857,00:38:10.73,00:38:10.73,"But, you know, now it's kind of turned the opposite,"
858,00:38:13.80,00:38:13.80,where we're all sharing in the cooking
859,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"and the smashing of the leaves,"
860,00:38:18.13,00:38:18.13,and now we're starting to kind of team up
861,00:38:20.60,00:38:20.60,"and pair up with the Chuay Gahn members,"
862,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,and I feel like we're getting to know them
863,00:38:24.27,00:38:24.27,a lot better than the first couple days.
864,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,"Erin, why should they keep you?"
865,00:38:28.33,00:38:28.33,Why not just vote you out tonight?
866,00:38:29.77,00:38:29.77,I think they should keep me
867,00:38:31.17,00:38:31.17,because I feel like I contribute to this tribe.
868,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,"I feel like I have, um..."
869,00:38:36.20,00:38:36.20,"haven't caused any, uh, turmoil or drama"
870,00:38:39.10,00:38:39.10,or hostility within the tribe.
871,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,I've been true to my word
872,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,"with each and every member, um, of Sook Jai."
873,00:38:45.63,00:38:45.63,And I feel like I'm an asset to this tribe.
874,00:38:48.27,00:38:48.27,"PROBST: Penny, how about you?"
875,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,You could be a threat at this point.
876,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,"Even though we still have a tribe game,"
877,00:38:52.40,00:38:52.40,"at some point, I got to get rid of you"
878,00:38:54.13,00:38:54.13,if I want to win this thing. Why not tonight?
879,00:38:56.23,00:38:56.23,I help the tribe out.
880,00:38:57.87,00:38:57.87,"You know, I-I do my chores."
881,00:39:00.03,00:39:00.03,I don't just lay around
882,00:39:01.63,00:39:01.63,unless we're all laying around as a group.
883,00:39:04.10,00:39:04.10,I just don't go off on my own and take little naps
884,00:39:06.57,00:39:06.57,unless the whole tribe is.
885,00:39:08.33,00:39:08.33,"Um, so I feel that I pull my own weight as well."
886,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,"Jake, how about for you? Three younger people--"
887,00:39:14.10,00:39:14.10,"""Let's turn on the old guy tonight and get rid of him."""
888,00:39:16.33,00:39:16.33,I'm probably the strongest of the teammates in the water.
889,00:39:19.20,00:39:19.20,So from any... anything that's got anything
890,00:39:21.17,00:39:21.17,"to do with the water, it's probably my bag,"
891,00:39:23.70,00:39:23.70,and I think most of my teammates know that.
892,00:39:26.30,00:39:26.30,I'm an early riser.
893,00:39:28.17,00:39:28.17,"And I like to get my chores done early,"
894,00:39:30.37,00:39:30.37,"and get everything taken care of,"
895,00:39:32.10,00:39:32.10,"so, I think I pull my own weight."
896,00:39:34.00,00:39:34.00,"How about for you, Ken?"
897,00:39:35.27,00:39:35.27,I think they should keep me because of the fact
898,00:39:37.43,00:39:37.43,that I am physically strong enough to get by.
899,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,"PROBST: Well, tonight's vote is big,"
900,00:39:44.00,00:39:44.00,because whoever is voted out tonight will become
901,00:39:45.87,00:39:45.87,the first member of our jury.
902,00:39:47.53,00:39:47.53,They'll have one of the seven votes
903,00:39:49.03,00:39:49.03,that ultimately determines who is the sole survivor.
904,00:39:52.47,00:39:52.47,They'll return to all future Tribal Councils
905,00:39:54.10,00:39:54.10,"to gather information,"
906,00:39:55.30,00:39:55.30,and they'll be a part of the final vote.
907,00:39:57.37,00:39:57.37,"So with that in mind, it is time to vote."
908,00:40:00.40,00:40:00.40,"Jake, you're first."
909,00:40:11.97,00:40:11.97,This is probably one of the most difficult votes
910,00:40:14.37,00:40:14.37,that I've ever had to do.
911,00:40:15.87,00:40:15.87,You've been a great tribe mate.
912,00:40:17.50,00:40:17.50,You've been a great companion.
913,00:40:37.53,00:40:37.53,I think you've roughed it enough.
914,00:40:39.03,00:40:39.03,It seems like it's beginning to wear on you.
915,00:40:49.30,00:40:49.30,I'll go tally the votes.
916,00:41:01.10,00:41:01.10,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
917,00:41:03.50,00:41:03.50,Person voted out will be asked
918,00:41:04.93,00:41:04.93,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
919,00:41:06.73,00:41:06.73,I'll read the votes.
920,00:41:12.73,00:41:12.73,First vote...
921,00:41:14.93,00:41:14.93,Ken.
922,00:41:20.10,00:41:20.10,Erin.
923,00:41:21.40,00:41:21.40,"That's one vote-- Erin, one vote-- Ken."
924,00:41:26.83,00:41:26.83,That's two votes-- Erin.
925,00:41:34.63,00:41:34.63,"The eighth person voted out,"
926,00:41:36.33,00:41:36.33,first member of our jury-- Erin.
927,00:41:40.90,00:41:40.90,You need to bring me your torch.
928,00:41:52.47,00:41:52.47,"Erin, the tribe has spoken."
929,00:41:56.57,00:41:56.57,It's time for you to go.
930,00:41:59.07,00:41:59.07,Good luck.
931,00:42:00.07,00:42:00.07,I love you guys.
932,00:42:01.50,00:42:01.50,I'm sorry.
933,00:42:06.47,00:42:06.47,Bye.
934,00:42:23.33,00:42:23.33,You guys are running out of members.
935,00:42:25.57,00:42:25.57,You're running out of time.
936,00:42:26.97,00:42:26.97,What you can't run out of is hope.
937,00:42:29.27,00:42:29.27,Anything is possible in this game.
938,00:42:32.10,00:42:32.10,"You need to go back to camp, try to get a good night's sleep."
939,00:42:35.13,00:42:35.13,Good night.
940,00:42:47.83,00:42:47.83, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
941,00:42:54.03,00:42:54.03,PROBST:   Next time on Survivor:
942,00:42:56.13,00:42:56.13, reminders of home  strike an emotional cord.
943,00:42:58.70,00:42:58.70,Oh ...
944,00:43:00.70,00:43:00.70,"PROBST: But for one survivor,  it could backfire."
945,00:43:02.53,00:43:02.53,Brand-new cars in the garage--
946,00:43:04.03,00:43:04.03," that'd be enough  to vote them off,"
947,00:43:05.43,00:43:05.43, because they don't need  the money.
948,00:43:06.87,00:43:06.87,PROBST: And the scramble  to the finish line begins.
949,00:43:09.43,00:43:09.43,They've been worried since square one that I was a threat.
950,00:43:11.90,00:43:11.90,We've got to create a little bit of a stir.
951,00:43:18.87,00:43:18.87,I'm very happy the way that I've played the game.
952,00:43:20.90,00:43:20.90,"My number one goal was to make it to the jury,"
953,00:43:22.93,00:43:22.93,and I made it.
954,00:43:24.37,00:43:24.37," I wasn't predicting  to get voted off tonight,"
955,00:43:26.47,00:43:26.47, but that's how the game is.
956,00:43:27.87,00:43:27.87," I came to Thailand  with a small bag and myself,"
957,00:43:30.77,00:43:30.77, and I'm leaving with more than  I ever could have expected.
958,00:43:33.77,00:43:33.77,I'm ready to sit back now and watch
959,00:43:35.27,00:43:35.27,"and see how the rest of the game is played,"
960,00:43:37.20,00:43:37.20,because it's extremely unpredictable.
