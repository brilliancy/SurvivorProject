3,00:00:04.37,00:00:04.37, to assess the two camps.
4,00:00:05.73,00:00:05.73,SHII ANN:This is great.
5,00:00:06.87,00:00:06.87,This is much betterthan our shelter.
6,00:00:08.37,00:00:08.37,"PROBST: Shii Ann and Clay visited Chuay Gahn,"
7,00:00:11.13,00:00:11.13, while Helen and Ken visited Sook Jai.
8,00:00:12.53,00:00:12.53,HELEN:Did you guys build this?
9,00:00:14.40,00:00:14.40,"-KEN: Yes, we did.-Wa-ho!"
10,00:00:16.73,00:00:16.73,PROBST: The two tribes willnow live together on one beach.
11,00:00:19.60,00:00:19.60,The question is: which beachare you going to live on?
12,00:00:22.13,00:00:22.13,-Looks like we're goingto Chuay Gahn. -Chuay Gahn.
13,00:00:23.60,00:00:23.60,"PROBST: Believing they had merged, Shii Ann made"
14,00:00:25.50,00:00:25.50, a plan with Chuay Gahn.
15,00:00:27.53,00:00:27.53,I'm working a deal.
16,00:00:28.53,00:00:28.53,I'm voting Penny out.
17,00:00:30.07,00:00:30.07,Don't sink everybody elseand yourself
18,00:00:32.33,00:00:32.33,because you're pissed offat one person.
19,00:00:33.97,00:00:33.97," If she does turn,"
20,00:00:35.47,00:00:35.47,"the rest of her life,she'll be considered a rat."
21,00:00:37.23,00:00:37.23,"PROBST: But at the immunity challenge,"
22,00:00:38.30,00:00:38.30, the survivors got a big surprise
23,00:00:39.63,00:00:39.63, when they learned the two tribes had not merged.
24,00:00:42.37,00:00:42.37,"What I said to you guyswhen you left is,"
25,00:00:45.37,00:00:45.37,two tribes will live togetheron the same beach.
26,00:00:48.77,00:00:48.77,Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn battled again for tribal immunity.
27,00:00:52.60,00:00:52.60,-(cheering)-Chuay Gahn wins immunity!
28,00:00:54.90,00:00:54.90," Chuay Gahn won, sending Sook Jai to Tribal Council,"
29,00:00:57.60,00:00:57.60, where Shii Ann found herself in the hot seat.
30,00:01:00.33,00:01:00.33,I have already found outthat some people
31,00:01:02.37,00:01:02.37,weren't being true to our tribe.
32,00:01:03.57,00:01:03.57,PROBST:Shii Ann tried to target Penny.
33,00:01:06.17,00:01:06.17,"SHII ANN:Penny, you're manipulative."
34,00:01:08.47,00:01:08.47,"I know that that's nota pleasant word,"
35,00:01:10.53,00:01:10.53,but it's the way thatyou've played the game.
36,00:01:12.77,00:01:12.77,"PROBST: But when the votes came in,"
37,00:01:13.90,00:01:13.90, it was Shii Ann who was voted out.
38,00:01:16.10,00:01:16.10," With both tribes living on the same beach,"
39,00:01:19.70,00:01:19.70, what strategies will come into play
40,00:01:21.80,00:01:21.80,and who will be voted out next?
41,00:02:34.57,00:02:34.57,TED: I'm not going to bed until I see
42,00:02:36.10,00:02:36.10,who is here.
43,00:02:37.23,00:02:37.23,"BRIAN:No, I got to see what's up."
44,00:02:39.00,00:02:39.00,Because if Shii Ann is gone...
45,00:02:40.27,00:02:40.27,I got to see who's comingback to our house.
46,00:02:43.33,00:02:43.33,-TED: After we spanked them.-BRIAN: Uh-huh.
47,00:02:44.93,00:02:44.93,TED:You know what I'm saying?
48,00:02:46.17,00:02:46.17,-Yep. -And I can't waitfor them to answer
49,00:02:48.10,00:02:48.10,the question when I say... I'mgonna ask them; I'm gonna say:
50,00:02:50.83,00:02:50.83,what made you vote off Erin
51,00:02:53.97,00:02:53.97,or what made you vote offShii Ann or whatever?
52,00:02:56.27,00:02:56.27,Just to seewhat their reaction will be.
53,00:02:58.97,00:02:58.97,"There is a lot of tension intheir camp, though, isn't there?"
54,00:03:00.83,00:03:00.83,"-There is a lot of tension.-Oh, there is, man."
55,00:03:02.63,00:03:02.63,"Like I said, if they vote off"
56,00:03:04.40,00:03:04.40,Su Yi... Sin Jun...they're not thinking.
57,00:03:08.43,00:03:08.43,-Nope. -Because she-she's a lotmore damage than Erin would be.
58,00:03:11.53,00:03:11.53,-So I'll be curious... -They'remaking an emotional decision.
59,00:03:13.27,00:03:13.27,Correct.
60,00:03:14.27,00:03:14.27,Which will be a mistake.
61,00:03:22.43,00:03:22.43,PENNY: Shii Ann was plotting against me
62,00:03:24.47,00:03:24.47," to the other tribe, and..."
63,00:03:26.80,00:03:26.80,"I thought she had succeededand I pretty much, you know,"
64,00:03:29.83,00:03:29.83,had already said my good-byes.
65,00:03:31.77,00:03:31.77,The joke is on heras far as I'm concerned.
66,00:03:34.13,00:03:34.13,I'm still here and she's not.
67,00:03:36.13,00:03:36.13, I couldn't have been happier
68,00:03:37.60,00:03:37.60, to hear that it was tribe against tribe
69,00:03:40.23,00:03:40.23,"because I knew, with Sook Jai,I was still safe."
70,00:03:43.33,00:03:43.33,We're all four andwe're all strong and true.
71,00:03:46.23,00:03:46.23,Let's stay together.
72,00:03:47.33,00:03:47.33,Let stay true to one another.
73,00:03:48.83,00:03:48.83,"Remember,"
74,00:03:50.07,00:03:50.07,we'll still be competingagainst this other team
75,00:03:52.67,00:03:52.67,"in future challenges,"
76,00:03:54.50,00:03:54.50,and just knowthat I love you all...
77,00:03:55.90,00:03:55.90,(overlapping chatter)
78,00:03:57.13,00:03:57.13,"...and I, and I...and thank you all very much"
79,00:03:59.27,00:03:59.27,for keeping me around.
80,00:04:00.80,00:04:00.80,"KEN: Well, Penny absolutely feels"
81,00:04:01.97,00:04:01.97,"she needs to do damage control,"
82,00:04:03.17,00:04:03.17," and I would, too, if I were her."
83,00:04:04.73,00:04:04.73,"She is definitely walkingon eggshells,"
84,00:04:06.33,00:04:06.33,"but she has beensince the second we got here,"
85,00:04:08.93,00:04:08.93," so she has to, she has to undo the damage"
86,00:04:11.30,00:04:11.30, that's already been done
87,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,and then tryto go on from there.
88,00:04:15.50,00:04:15.50,Hey.
89,00:04:16.67,00:04:16.67,"-Oh, hey, guys.-Hey."
90,00:04:18.10,00:04:18.10,"-Honey, we're home.-Hey, y'all, about damn time."
91,00:04:19.33,00:04:19.33,-We're finally back.-My God.
92,00:04:21.63,00:04:21.63,-Is soup on?-Is soup on?
93,00:04:23.73,00:04:23.73,-(overlapping chatter)-I'm so cold.
94,00:04:26.43,00:04:26.43,TED:Got noodles over there.
95,00:04:27.77,00:04:27.77,"Oh, there's noodles?"
96,00:04:30.13,00:04:30.13,"Oh, my God."
97,00:04:31.50,00:04:31.50,"Hey, congratulations, y'all."
98,00:04:33.03,00:04:33.03,Thank you.
99,00:04:34.03,00:04:34.03,"Yeah, you did a good job."
100,00:04:35.73,00:04:35.73,-Who'd we lose?-Shii Ann.
101,00:04:37.60,00:04:37.60,"Shii Ann?Dad gum, like I figured."
102,00:04:40.07,00:04:40.07,(laughter)
103,00:04:41.23,00:04:41.23,TED: What madeyou guys vote off Shii Ann?
104,00:04:43.20,00:04:43.20,KEN:She kind of threatened us.
105,00:04:44.37,00:04:44.37,Threatened you?
106,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,"Well, she, she seems to claim"
107,00:04:48.43,00:04:48.43,that you guys havea deal with her that
108,00:04:50.83,00:04:50.83,"if we got rid of her,you guys were going"
109,00:04:52.40,00:04:52.40,"to pick us off one by one, so..."
110,00:04:55.37,00:04:55.37,"we didn't like to havea threat like that,"
111,00:04:57.13,00:04:57.13,so we voted her the hell out.
112,00:04:58.57,00:04:58.57,She what?!
113,00:04:59.73,00:04:59.73,She said that you guysand her had a deal.
114,00:05:01.23,00:05:01.23,TED: They were dead-on
115,00:05:02.60,00:05:02.60," with their accusation, and I knew that they knew."
116,00:05:05.20,00:05:05.20,"I mean, it's, it's true."
117,00:05:07.40,00:05:07.40,"If Shii Annwould've came over,"
118,00:05:09.50,00:05:09.50,we would've voted Penny off.
119,00:05:11.27,00:05:11.27,That's a hell of a strategy.
120,00:05:12.80,00:05:12.80,-It kind of backfired on her.-Yeah.
121,00:05:14.80,00:05:14.80,That was kind of stupid to say.
122,00:05:16.23,00:05:16.23,"BRIAN: I think it was a little bit of a, of an act."
123,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17," They kind of knew what was going on with her, too,"
124,00:05:21.10,00:05:21.10, and they just wanted to act more surprised 
125,00:05:22.87,00:05:22.87," than they were, so we kind of knew that."
126,00:05:24.33,00:05:24.33,"And we're all kind of going,""Okay, uh-huh, whatever."""
127,00:05:28.30,00:05:28.30,"You guys pick us off one at atime, we'll know she was right."
128,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,"-Yep.-CLAY: First off, you guys,"
129,00:05:32.00,00:05:32.00,we got to go play the game.
130,00:05:33.13,00:05:33.13,-Yeah.-We're not a tribe yet.
131,00:05:35.53,00:05:35.53,"Far as we know,we'll do what we did today"
132,00:05:37.33,00:05:37.33,again tomorrow and the next dayand the next day.
133,00:05:39.93,00:05:39.93,"KEN: We're in a uniqueposition, because, uh,"
134,00:05:41.90,00:05:41.90,"except for the personvoted out tonight, everybody..."
135,00:05:45.30,00:05:45.30,is now part of the jury.
136,00:05:47.47,00:05:47.47,"CLAY: There we go.That, I was just gonna ask that."
137,00:05:49.10,00:05:49.10,So we're all...we're here the rest of...
138,00:05:50.80,00:05:50.80,"-the entire time?-PENNY: Yes, we all are."
139,00:05:56.00,00:05:56.00,"PENNY: Y'all sleep tight, don'tlet the mosquito bugs bite."
140,00:06:04.47,00:06:04.47,"BRIAN: Of course, when I look at Sook Jai, I see enemy,"
141,00:06:07.50,00:06:07.50," I see ""other tribe,"" I see who we've been competing with"
142,00:06:10.37,00:06:10.37," for these last, uh, so many weeks here."
143,00:06:12.27,00:06:12.27," I can't just, all a sudden,"
144,00:06:13.60,00:06:13.60,"""Oh, great, one happy family,I love you guys. Hello."""
145,00:06:16.17,00:06:16.17,That's not gonna happen.
146,00:06:17.90,00:06:17.90,"They're gonna have to earn that respect, they're gonna have"
147,00:06:19.87,00:06:19.87," to earn that trust, they're gonna have to gain my trust."
148,00:06:21.50,00:06:21.50, I'm kind of seeing who's doing what
149,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00, or who's not doing what and kind of feeling them out.
150,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17," It's still sort of like sleeping with the enemy,"
151,00:06:27.33,00:06:27.33, so that's a little bit of a weird feeling.
152,00:06:46.53,00:06:46.53,-TED: Good morning.-PENNY: How are you?
153,00:06:48.37,00:06:48.37,I'm doing great.How are you doing?

159,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83,"-It's okay.-No, that's all right..."
160,00:07:01.90,00:07:01.90,"I mean, you can stop by;it's okay."
161,00:07:03.97,00:07:03.97,PENNY: I just wantedto come and say hello.

172,00:07:28.57,00:07:28.57,I love to wake up to that.
173,00:07:30.17,00:07:30.17,Kind of like stumblein the kitchen
174,00:07:31.37,00:07:31.37,"in the morning,just get that kick in the ass."
175,00:07:32.90,00:07:32.90,"All right, by God,here I come."

178,00:07:38.30,00:07:38.30, is really going out of her way
179,00:07:40.40,00:07:40.40,"to be superly overly nice,"
180,00:07:41.67,00:07:41.67,to the point whereit doesn't feel genuine.
181,00:07:45.03,00:07:45.03,It feels... it feels fake.
182,00:07:47.87,00:07:47.87,We were thankful thaty'all had a fire for us
183,00:07:50.33,00:07:50.33,-and some soup left.-Yeah. Yeah.
184,00:07:52.50,00:07:52.50,There's a little dirton your nose.

188,00:07:59.70,00:07:59.70," uh, uses being very cute and very sweet"
189,00:08:03.57,00:08:03.57,"to her advantage in the game,and... why not?"
190,00:08:06.43,00:08:06.43,"It's part of her tools,part of the package."

201,00:08:28.03,00:08:28.03, She thinks her looks and her little talent
202,00:08:30.40,00:08:30.40, can get whatever she wants out of men.
203,00:08:33.37,00:08:33.37, Well...
204,00:08:35.13,00:08:35.13,"I'm 46, she ain't getting ...from this one."
205,00:08:39.00,00:08:39.00," She has tried to butter me up,"
206,00:08:40.27,00:08:40.27, she has tried to butter Brian up
207,00:08:42.03,00:08:42.03," and she has tried to butter Ted up, and every time"

209,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,we all just kind ofcut our eyes over
210,00:08:47.73,00:08:47.73,"and giggle, like, yeah,there's a little bit more"
211,00:08:50.07,00:08:50.07,of that butterthat's not working.

217,00:09:04.50,00:09:04.50,how I respond to it.

219,00:09:07.80,00:09:07.80,"CLAY:Damn, it's pressure."
220,00:09:09.00,00:09:09.00,One more time...
221,00:09:10.43,00:09:10.43,KEN: There's definitelya strategic reason to get along

224,00:09:17.97,00:09:17.97,because thingschange real quick.

242,00:10:04.07,00:10:04.07,(indistinct conversation)
243,00:10:05.97,00:10:05.97,Can I pick somebodyto share that with?
244,00:10:07.30,00:10:07.30,"JAKE:Are we sharing these, or, uh..."
245,00:10:09.17,00:10:09.17,"-Uh, no.-Would you like to share?"
246,00:10:10.73,00:10:10.73,There's one for all of us.
247,00:10:12.33,00:10:12.33,"BRIAN: As much as they don't want to admit it, as much as"
248,00:10:13.93,00:10:13.93," we try not to admit it,"
249,00:10:15.17,00:10:15.17," it's us against them, simple as that."
250,00:10:16.93,00:10:16.93, Even though we're livingtogether and hanging out and...
251,00:10:19.43,00:10:19.43,"it all looks peachy,there's a lot of phoniness."
252,00:10:22.30,00:10:22.30,"Everyone wants to start pickingpeople off, I can just feel it,"
253,00:10:24.47,00:10:24.47, slowly but surely.
254,00:10:25.57,00:10:25.57, I can feel it.
255,00:10:26.97,00:10:26.97,"I can sme... sense it,I can smell it."
256,00:10:33.17,00:10:33.17,KEN: The cave smells of urine.
257,00:10:35.47,00:10:35.47, Chuay Gahn 
258,00:10:36.80,00:10:36.80,has been pissingin the front of the cave.
259,00:10:38.87,00:10:38.87,So now the whole caveis starting to smell.
260,00:10:40.97,00:10:40.97, It's the piss cave. Very nice.
261,00:10:43.20,00:10:43.20,"I'm surprised, with that sunhitting that sand"
262,00:10:45.53,00:10:45.53,"and everything,that it even stinks, so..."
263,00:10:47.57,00:10:47.57,"Well, it doesn't hit the sand;it's right here inside the cave."
264,00:10:50.70,00:10:50.70,JAKE: Why don't they peeout there in the sand?
265,00:10:53.57,00:10:53.57,"I don't know, I didn't do it."
266,00:10:55.17,00:10:55.17," I come here, I lay down at the front"
267,00:10:57.03,00:10:57.03," of their cave, and I smell urine."
268,00:10:58.47,00:10:58.47,It's like pissingin your front door.
269,00:10:59.60,00:10:59.60,"You know, you walkin your front door,"
270,00:11:00.90,00:11:00.90,"you close it,""Honey, I'm home,"
271,00:11:01.90,00:11:01.90,"let me take a piss right here."""
272,00:11:03.83,00:11:03.83, Animals don't even do that.
273,00:11:05.30,00:11:05.30, Animals are genetically...
274,00:11:07.07,00:11:07.07, encoded not to piss where they eat.
275,00:11:10.50,00:11:10.50, And it's happening here.
276,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,"I-I don't understand it, but..."
277,00:11:13.63,00:11:13.63,"KEN:It stinks, though."
278,00:11:14.93,00:11:14.93,It smells like underthe boardwalk in Coney Island.
279,00:11:17.07,00:11:17.07, I do feel like a visitor here.
280,00:11:18.77,00:11:18.77,Personally... I-I don't goaround pissing where I sleep.
281,00:11:22.33,00:11:22.33,"They do, and justfor that simple fact,"
282,00:11:24.53,00:11:24.53, I can't feel at home here.
283,00:11:25.90,00:11:25.90,He wants to go pee first.
284,00:11:27.67,00:11:27.67,CLAY: There ain't nobody peeing in the cave.
285,00:11:29.93,00:11:29.93," I mean, it smells like a cave the whole time I've been here."
286,00:11:33.10,00:11:33.10," I mean, it's nothing like"
287,00:11:34.33,00:11:34.33,"your living roomwith the candles going,"
288,00:11:35.97,00:11:35.97,that's for damn sure.
289,00:11:37.03,00:11:37.03,But it is a cave.
290,00:11:38.53,00:11:38.53, You can't forget that.
291,00:11:53.90,00:11:53.90,"JAN: Plate washers, let's go,let's go. Chop-chop."
292,00:12:01.23,00:12:01.23,"But it's interest... interestingto me, even after, uh,"
293,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,being out here in the wilderness
294,00:12:05.07,00:12:05.07,"after hundreds of thousandsof years, the girls"
295,00:12:07.17,00:12:07.17,"are still doing...are very domesticated,"
296,00:12:08.57,00:12:08.57,"and they enjoy it,which I think is great."
297,00:12:10.67,00:12:10.67,"JAKE: Yeah, 'cause I told 'emI'd be happy to do the dishes."
298,00:12:13.53,00:12:13.53,"BRIAN:Kind of resorts back to,"
299,00:12:14.87,00:12:14.87,"like, the good old days,when the men just ate,"
300,00:12:16.97,00:12:16.97,and the women didall the cooking and cleaning.
301,00:12:19.27,00:12:19.27,-So... -JAKE (laughs):You notice he's saying that
302,00:12:21.30,00:12:21.30,when they're down there.
303,00:12:22.63,00:12:22.63,"BRIAN: Yeah, of course,but it's very interesting."
304,00:12:24.07,00:12:24.07,"I mean, it's a...it's quite an observation."
305,00:12:28.87,00:12:28.87,-So it's four...-HELEN: Four cups of flour
306,00:12:31.30,00:12:31.30,and one cup of sugar.
307,00:12:32.43,00:12:32.43,Only one cup of sugar?
308,00:12:33.57,00:12:33.57,"Yeah, and a little bitof vanilla."
309,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30,"And, uh, my grandmother'scaramel recipe--"
310,00:12:36.70,00:12:36.70,"that's pretty good, too.You cut them"
311,00:12:38.23,00:12:38.23,"in these little, you know,squares like this,"
312,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77,and you... then you fold upthe wax paper.
313,00:12:41.50,00:12:41.50,-No way I can do that.-Uh-uh.
314,00:12:43.37,00:12:43.37,JAKE: I like every single person on the other tribe.
315,00:12:45.50,00:12:45.50, The only one that drives me crazy
316,00:12:47.13,00:12:47.13, is Helen with the constant recipes.
317,00:12:49.50,00:12:49.50,"You know, I've heard recipestill I'm just green in the face."
318,00:12:52.87,00:12:52.87,Swedish almond bars.
319,00:12:54.50,00:12:54.50,"You start outwith your cookie sheet,"
320,00:12:56.00,00:12:56.00,you put the toasted almondsall over the bottom.
321,00:12:57.63,00:12:57.63,"Pour the batter on top.Like, I'll sprinkle raisins"
322,00:12:59.40,00:12:59.40,around on that.I love raisins.
323,00:13:00.50,00:13:00.50,"See, I'm nota big raisin person."
324,00:13:01.77,00:13:01.77,-HELEN: Yeah.-JAKE: My God.
325,00:13:03.77,00:13:03.77," You need, I need to go somewhere else when she starts"
326,00:13:05.87,00:13:05.87,"that recipe stuff,which is nonstop 24-7."
327,00:13:08.83,00:13:08.83,Cashew butterscotch squares.
328,00:13:10.40,00:13:10.40,"-Ooh, that sounds good.-Ooh, what are those?"
329,00:13:12.23,00:13:12.23,"Same type thing--pastry on the bottom,"
330,00:13:13.93,00:13:13.93,"and then cashewsand butterscotch chips on top,"
331,00:13:15.63,00:13:15.63,and they bake in the oven.
332,00:13:16.93,00:13:16.93,It's-- just is somethingto cut into squares
333,00:13:18.43,00:13:18.43,and put in people'slunch boxes and stuff.
334,00:13:20.87,00:13:20.87,"-Got-dang, that incessant talkabout food... -Yeah."
335,00:13:24.20,00:13:24.20,-and recipes drives metotally wild. -Uh-huh.
336,00:13:26.30,00:13:26.30,That's why I'm morethan happy to go out.
337,00:13:28.47,00:13:28.47,-Yakety-yakety-yak.-Helen loves to just talk
338,00:13:30.43,00:13:30.43,-about the same thing.-And it's all food.
339,00:13:32.50,00:13:32.50,"I'm thinking, Jesus,don't you girls ever just be?"
340,00:13:35.37,00:13:35.37,BRIAN: Jake and I like to get out.
341,00:13:36.83,00:13:36.83, I'm kind of getting a little bit of cabin fever
342,00:13:38.50,00:13:38.50," or, if they want to call it out here, a little cave, uh..."
343,00:13:40.60,00:13:40.60,"uh, cave fever."
344,00:13:41.93,00:13:41.93,I'm going stir-cavey.
345,00:13:43.37,00:13:43.37,(thunder crashing)
346,00:13:54.83,00:13:54.83,"JAKE: I'm very careful with what I tell Brian,"
347,00:13:56.70,00:13:56.70, and I think he's probably very careful
348,00:13:58.97,00:13:58.97, with what he tells me.
349,00:14:00.30,00:14:00.30,We're still two separate tribes.
350,00:14:07.17,00:14:07.17,Which one of our girlsdo you think's the best-looking?
351,00:14:10.67,00:14:10.67,"-Oh, out of Penny or Erin?-Yeah."
352,00:14:12.57,00:14:12.57,I think Penny's gota cuter look.
353,00:14:14.53,00:14:14.53,Exotic-looking-- she's...she's a pretty girl.
354,00:14:17.07,00:14:17.07,JAKE: I'm trying to figure out
355,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67," information from him, like: who in your tribe"
356,00:14:20.80,00:14:20.80, would you think should be voted off first?
357,00:14:23.93,00:14:23.93, And he's doing the same thing to me all the time.
358,00:14:26.23,00:14:26.23," And part of the time,"
359,00:14:27.73,00:14:27.73,"we're telling each otherthe truth,"
360,00:14:29.40,00:14:29.40,"and part of the time, we'rekind of fudging a little bit."
361,00:14:32.07,00:14:32.07,"But, you know, we're building"
362,00:14:33.40,00:14:33.40," a confidence with one another,"
363,00:14:35.27,00:14:35.27," and once that confidence is built,"
364,00:14:37.27,00:14:37.27, then I think we'll be able to...
365,00:14:39.30,00:14:39.30,form an alliance of sorts.
366,00:14:42.47,00:14:42.47,"BRIAN: Jake, he might be picking my brain a little bit,"
367,00:14:44.83,00:14:44.83," but I'm not, uh, telling him much."
368,00:14:46.93,00:14:46.93,He's always askinga couple questions here
369,00:14:48.37,00:14:48.37,"how I feel about the tribe,"
370,00:14:49.70,00:14:49.70," and he's kind of feeling me out,"
371,00:14:51.33,00:14:51.33, and I'm not giving him anything-- at least not yet.
372,00:15:05.37,00:15:05.37,"HELEN: A cup of sugar,half a cup of plain old cocoa."
373,00:15:09.33,00:15:09.33,"You know, cocoa, not mix."
374,00:15:10.70,00:15:10.70,-Mm-hmm.-Cocoa.
375,00:15:12.07,00:15:12.07,"Then you're going to takeanother cup of sugar,"
376,00:15:13.90,00:15:13.90,and you're going to pour...
377,00:15:15.67,00:15:15.67,Brian-- he's a good guy.
378,00:15:18.03,00:15:18.03,"Yeah, I like him."
379,00:15:19.50,00:15:19.50,I was going to seeif you wanted
380,00:15:21.23,00:15:21.23,to try to figure outif we could make
381,00:15:24.63,00:15:24.63,"you and I from this side,"
382,00:15:26.27,00:15:26.27,"and him and Clay from that side,be the final four."
383,00:15:30.37,00:15:30.37,"Well, uh, if you'll leave mealone with him"
384,00:15:33.27,00:15:33.27,"a little bit longer,I might be able to get to that."
385,00:15:35.93,00:15:35.93,-Okay.-I might be able to.
386,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,But... I'm just not sure.
387,00:15:40.93,00:15:40.93,"Yeah, don't be."
388,00:15:42.40,00:15:42.40,Don't believeeverything he says.
389,00:15:44.27,00:15:44.27,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm not."
390,00:15:45.60,00:15:45.60,"Just remember,he's a used car dealer."
391,00:15:47.43,00:15:47.43,Mm-hmm.
392,00:15:48.63,00:15:48.63,What do they sell?They sell lemons.
393,00:15:50.30,00:15:50.30,-Mm-hmm.-Be careful.
394,00:16:00.53,00:16:00.53,"JAN:Treemail, children!"
395,00:16:02.90,00:16:02.90,JAKE:Treemail!
396,00:16:04.60,00:16:04.60,You guys are goingto go bonkers over this.
397,00:16:06.83,00:16:06.83,-Holy...-What is that?
398,00:16:08.57,00:16:08.57,That looks to me
399,00:16:09.93,00:16:09.93,like the immunity idolin that... inside that...
400,00:16:11.80,00:16:11.80,-Inside.-Looks like a genie
401,00:16:13.77,00:16:13.77,-in a crystal ball.-Wow.
402,00:16:14.80,00:16:14.80,"JAKE:""How you deal with adversity"
403,00:16:16.87,00:16:16.87,"""will show who copes the best."
404,00:16:19.33,00:16:19.33,"""Anyone can shinewhen it's easy,"
405,00:16:21.03,00:16:21.03,"""but how do you dealwith stress?"
406,00:16:23.63,00:16:23.63,"""No physical strength required,or power from your brain."
407,00:16:27.60,00:16:27.60,"All you need for this oneis the desire to win this game."""
408,00:16:31.97,00:16:31.97,Wow.
409,00:16:33.30,00:16:33.30,JAKE: Sook Jai really needs to win
410,00:16:35.10,00:16:35.10, this immunity challenge bad.
411,00:16:36.63,00:16:36.63," I mean, if we could possibly win this one,"
412,00:16:39.30,00:16:39.30,that would put us back
413,00:16:40.47,00:16:40.47,on an equal footingwith the other tribe.
414,00:16:46.57,00:16:46.57,(screeches)
415,00:17:01.73,00:17:01.73,First things first-- Brian.
416,00:17:05.73,00:17:05.73,Take back the immunity idol.
417,00:17:09.37,00:17:09.37,"Today's challengeis for immunity,"
418,00:17:11.43,00:17:11.43,and it's going to testyour ability to remain calm
419,00:17:14.70,00:17:14.70,when your instinctstell you to panic.
420,00:17:17.47,00:17:17.47,We've constructed eightindividual bamboo snorkels.
421,00:17:20.70,00:17:20.70,"You'll take a deep breath,"
422,00:17:22.43,00:17:22.43,"go underwater, get your moutharound the snorkel piece,"
423,00:17:25.50,00:17:25.50,blow out the waterand then begin normal breathing.
424,00:17:29.60,00:17:29.60,"So, in theory,you should be able"
425,00:17:31.07,00:17:31.07,"to stay down therefor a long time,"
426,00:17:32.77,00:17:32.77,"but for some of you,those first few breaths"
427,00:17:36.20,00:17:36.20,are going to be cause for panic.
428,00:17:37.93,00:17:37.93,These snorkelsare not traditional snorkels.
429,00:17:40.47,00:17:40.47,They don't have a mouthpiecethat has a good snug fit.
430,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,It's a piece of bamboo.
431,00:17:45.23,00:17:45.23,You're going to leak a little.
432,00:17:46.60,00:17:46.60,You're probably goingto swallow some salt water.
433,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,"Once you come upfor air, you're out."
434,00:17:50.90,00:17:50.90,"Because thisis a tribe challenge,"
435,00:17:52.93,00:17:52.93,here's how we'lldetermine the winner.
436,00:17:54.17,00:17:54.17,We'll take the totalcumulative time
437,00:17:56.90,00:17:56.90,for the members of each tribe.
438,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,So every secondyou're underwater counts.
439,00:18:02.53,00:18:02.53,"Three of your memberscould come up right away,"
440,00:18:04.40,00:18:04.40,"and if the fourth personstays down long enough,"
441,00:18:06.33,00:18:06.33,you can still win this thing.
442,00:18:07.67,00:18:07.67,"Chuay Gahn, for the first time,"
443,00:18:09.60,00:18:09.60,you have more membersthan Sook Jai.
444,00:18:11.60,00:18:11.60,You're sitting one person out.Who's sitting out?
445,00:18:13.43,00:18:13.43,-Uh... Helen.-Helen.
446,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,"Helen, take your spotat the front of the boat."
447,00:18:16.97,00:18:16.97,"Everybody else,take your positions."
448,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,Wait for my go.
449,00:18:22.13,00:18:22.13,Swim on out and take your spot.
450,00:18:30.07,00:18:30.07,This challenge could last hours;could be over in minutes.
451,00:18:33.70,00:18:33.70,All dependson how you handle stress.
452,00:18:36.73,00:18:36.73,"Here we go, guys.For immunity."
453,00:18:39.07,00:18:39.07,"Three, two, one."
454,00:18:41.97,00:18:41.97,Down.

456,00:19:19.87,00:19:19.87,"(wheezes, coughs)"
457,00:19:21.67,00:19:21.67,"Ken, you're up at 15 seconds."

463,00:19:44.50,00:19:44.50,"Wow, that was fast, guys."
464,00:19:46.97,00:19:46.97,"Erin, up at 25 seconds."
465,00:19:51.07,00:19:51.07,Only two people leftin the water:
466,00:19:53.07,00:19:53.07,"Brian for Chuay Gahn,Jake for Sook Jai."

470,00:20:02.23,00:20:02.23,That's a 15-second leadfor Chuay Gahn.
471,00:20:06.07,00:20:06.07,The only way Sook Jai can winis if Jake
472,00:20:08.50,00:20:08.50,stays under the water16 seconds longer than Brian.
473,00:20:12.33,00:20:12.33,"Jake comes up first,Chuay Gahn wins immunity."

494,00:22:24.37,00:22:24.37,"I'm hungry, y'all."
495,00:22:25.83,00:22:25.83,"I'm telling you, I am hungry."
496,00:22:27.43,00:22:27.43,"Get out, before you come back,you're just hungry."
497,00:22:29.93,00:22:29.93,"It's like,it's like leaving the house."
498,00:22:31.60,00:22:31.60,"-You're just hungry, period,you know? -Yeah."
499,00:22:33.80,00:22:33.80,Let's get some woodon this fire.
500,00:22:40.60,00:22:40.60,Is there any reason why the lidis off our noodles?
501,00:22:45.07,00:22:45.07,"You're kidding me, right?"
502,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,No.
503,00:22:47.93,00:22:47.93,"Like, then they're dumped outon the floor."
504,00:22:50.70,00:22:50.70,Here.
505,00:22:54.33,00:22:54.33,No. He opened the lid and gotinto the real stuff.

509,00:23:04.77,00:23:04.77,All the bananas that were savedfor tonight are gone.
510,00:23:07.43,00:23:07.43,No way!

512,00:23:10.93,00:23:10.93,"Well, I did thinkthat that was a possibility."
513,00:23:14.93,00:23:14.93,He came in here messing around.
514,00:23:16.23,00:23:16.23,They must be bringingthe whole family down here.
515,00:23:18.03,00:23:18.03,"-Yeah, he scouted outthe area... -Oh, big-time."
516,00:23:19.67,00:23:19.67,The chicken feed was in...
517,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,"they-they gotinto the chicken feed, too."

519,00:23:24.80,00:23:24.80,-The chicken's gone?-No!
520,00:23:26.53,00:23:26.53,"No, just the chicken feed."

524,00:23:35.90,00:23:35.90,he ate the bananasthat we had left for tonight
525,00:23:39.33,00:23:39.33,that were just perfectly ripe.
526,00:23:41.77,00:23:41.77,Damn monkey-- I swear I'm goingto kill him if I get him.
527,00:23:45.00,00:23:45.00, And then he got into our noodles.
528,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43," I mean, my God, that... that's it."
529,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87, That's our food here.
530,00:23:49.27,00:23:49.27, I have real doubts that it's going to last us
531,00:23:51.77,00:23:51.77," the next two and a half weeks, anyway."
532,00:23:53.47,00:23:53.47, With monkey claws in there
533,00:23:54.80,00:23:54.80," taking them out, uh, it's not going to last."
534,00:23:57.03,00:23:57.03, -It-it's just not. -We got to eat.
535,00:23:58.53,00:23:58.53,Thank you.That's... that's good enough.
536,00:24:00.40,00:24:00.40,-That's perfect.-HELEN: If he takes our...
537,00:24:01.87,00:24:01.87,"if he takes our noodles, we areup the creek without a paddle."
538,00:24:05.20,00:24:05.20,"We'll be eating rocksor something, so..."
539,00:24:16.17,00:24:16.17,If I'd have blownthat water out...
540,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,You got one shot at it.
541,00:24:20.17,00:24:20.17,-Yeah. -You didn't get itthe first time.
542,00:24:21.80,00:24:21.80,"-You didn't have enough oxygento get the thrust, -Uh-uh."
543,00:24:24.73,00:24:24.73,because of the...
544,00:24:29.03,00:24:29.03,JAKE: It's... it's really hard on me today
545,00:24:31.33,00:24:31.33, 'cause I'm taking this one really personal.
546,00:24:33.37,00:24:33.37, I feel totally responsible for the fact
547,00:24:36.23,00:24:36.23, that we're going back to Tribal Council.
548,00:24:38.77,00:24:38.77, What I'd rather do is just go off somewhere
549,00:24:40.63,00:24:40.63, and just be by myself
550,00:24:42.30,00:24:42.30,"and act... you know,just be pissed off."
551,00:24:46.53,00:24:46.53, But you can't do that.
552,00:24:47.87,00:24:47.87," I mean, you came back here with the winners."
553,00:24:49.40,00:24:49.40, They're the winners. You got to congratulate them.
554,00:24:51.07,00:24:51.07, You got to try not to berate yourself so bad
555,00:24:54.63,00:24:54.63," in front of them, even though"
556,00:24:56.50,00:24:56.50,"it's happeningunderneath the core,"
557,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40,"you know,where you're just saying,"
558,00:24:59.97,00:24:59.97,"""Why did you do that?"
559,00:25:01.60,00:25:01.60,"Why did it happenthat way today?"""
560,00:25:04.00,00:25:04.00,"Win some, you lose some."
561,00:25:05.63,00:25:05.63,"It sucks, but you know what?"
562,00:25:07.37,00:25:07.37,(Jake sniffles)
563,00:25:08.70,00:25:08.70,W-Well... we can't go backand change it.
564,00:25:11.17,00:25:11.17,I wish I could.
565,00:25:12.87,00:25:12.87,"I... I wish I could, too."
566,00:25:15.13,00:25:15.13,"This is how our fateis determined, okay?"
567,00:25:18.37,00:25:18.37,"And we're a team,and we said that"
568,00:25:20.97,00:25:20.97,we were going to rebuildourselves after all...
569,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,all that crap with Shii Ann.
570,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,"We have rebuilt ourselves,but you know what?"
571,00:25:26.87,00:25:26.87,We knew that this daywas going to come.
572,00:25:28.90,00:25:28.90,We knew we weregoing to have to start
573,00:25:30.77,00:25:30.77,voting out peoplethat we didn't want to.
574,00:25:34.77,00:25:34.77,"And it sucks, but you know what?"
575,00:25:36.27,00:25:36.27,You got to be strongin your heart.
576,00:25:40.50,00:25:40.50,Thanks.
577,00:25:41.83,00:25:41.83,And I don't blame you.
578,00:25:42.93,00:25:42.93,Penny doesn't blame you.
579,00:25:43.97,00:25:43.97,Ken doesn't blame you.
580,00:25:45.10,00:25:45.10,None of us blame you.
581,00:25:46.23,00:25:46.23,It's part of the game.
582,00:25:47.60,00:25:47.60,Okay.
583,00:25:49.33,00:25:49.33,It is not your fault.
584,00:25:51.13,00:25:51.13,-Okay.-Okay?
585,00:25:52.57,00:25:52.57,"You believe me, okay?"
586,00:25:53.93,00:25:53.93,Okay.
587,00:26:00.00,00:26:00.00,(Jake sniffling)
588,00:26:12.47,00:26:12.47,"BRIAN: Well, we had another,uh, immunity challenge and, um,"
589,00:26:16.07,00:26:16.07," it's still kind of weird, though,"
590,00:26:17.73,00:26:17.73, winning and then having to come back
591,00:26:19.40,00:26:19.40, and not really being able to celebrate a win.
592,00:26:21.63,00:26:21.63," So you're not looking too, uh... uh..."
593,00:26:23.70,00:26:23.70,"uh, happy, because they've got"
594,00:26:25.40,00:26:25.40,"a major, disappointingdecision to make."
595,00:26:27.23,00:26:27.23,So that'sa very strange feeling.
596,00:26:29.10,00:26:29.10,-It's not a fun win.-It's like a bittersweet...
597,00:26:30.57,00:26:30.57,"a bittersweet victory,you know what I mean?"
598,00:26:32.17,00:26:32.17,"-I think we're both cheatedin some way. -I know, 'cause I"
599,00:26:34.07,00:26:34.07,don't want to say good-byeto any of you guys.
600,00:26:35.70,00:26:35.70,And we're cheated...we're cheated
601,00:26:36.90,00:26:36.90,because we can't reallyfully enjoy our win.
602,00:26:39.77,00:26:39.77,-Right?-Right.
603,00:26:40.93,00:26:40.93,Because we kind of likeyou guys. You-you...
604,00:26:43.90,00:26:43.90,-you're living with us.-It's sad.
605,00:26:45.10,00:26:45.10,"You know, you guys"
606,00:26:46.30,00:26:46.30,"obviously can't be happy,really, for us,"
607,00:26:48.17,00:26:48.17,because of the decision
608,00:26:49.87,00:26:49.87,that has to be madeand stuff like that.
609,00:26:52.17,00:26:52.17,So... this...this is a weird way of feeling.
610,00:26:54.73,00:26:54.73,You want to jump and hollerand...
611,00:26:56.43,00:26:56.43,"and scream, but you can't,because,"
612,00:26:58.07,00:26:58.07," you know, the people living with you that you just beat."
613,00:27:00.37,00:27:00.37, And you don't want to rub it in their face
614,00:27:02.17,00:27:02.17," 'cause, you know, that can hurt you later on"
615,00:27:03.97,00:27:03.97," if one of them's on the jury. But yet,"
616,00:27:05.73,00:27:05.73," they were sad, but trying to be happy for us."
617,00:27:07.33,00:27:07.33," And that's why we're just having to tell them,"
618,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40," ""Oh, we're so sorry y'all got to go"
619,00:27:10.83,00:27:10.83,"to Tribal Council tonight,"""
620,00:27:12.07,00:27:12.07,"but we were so damn happy,it was unbelievable."
621,00:27:14.90,00:27:14.90,"...we don't leave anything out,too-- no coconut out, nothing."
622,00:27:16.97,00:27:16.97,"PENNY: This is the first time, I think,"
623,00:27:18.77,00:27:18.77, we've really actually been able to talk
624,00:27:21.83,00:27:21.83," about how we're all feeling, because..."
625,00:27:23.67,00:27:23.67, now you've got four people who are pissed off
626,00:27:25.93,00:27:25.93,"that we didn't win,and you've got five happy people"
627,00:27:28.73,00:27:28.73,who can't talk about how badlythey just kicked our butts.
628,00:27:32.80,00:27:32.80," And when you're losing all the time against them,"
629,00:27:35.30,00:27:35.30, it's hard to stay upbeat
630,00:27:37.30,00:27:37.30, and keep your mind off the game.
631,00:27:44.87,00:27:44.87,JAKE: My personal opinionis we ought to cook the chicken.
632,00:27:47.87,00:27:47.87,"Mine, too."
633,00:27:49.90,00:27:49.90,"I mean, they're goingto share it with us anyway,"
634,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,but at least...
635,00:27:53.77,00:27:53.77,lets who brought it into campget a chance to eat it.
636,00:27:56.47,00:27:56.47,-Together.-Yeah.
637,00:27:58.70,00:27:58.70,That's fine by me--whatever you guys want to do.
638,00:28:02.20,00:28:02.20,This was supposed to have beenthe final four. (laughs)
639,00:28:05.27,00:28:05.27,"Well, it is the final four."
640,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,(laughing):In our tribe.
641,00:28:09.00,00:28:09.00,It's the final fourout of the final nine.
642,00:28:12.40,00:28:12.40,"Don't take it to heart, Pops."
643,00:28:14.67,00:28:14.67,"Well, thanks."
644,00:28:16.07,00:28:16.07,"I mean, look, we...this is our fourth time"
645,00:28:18.03,00:28:18.03,in a row to goto Tribal Council.
646,00:28:20.87,00:28:20.87,They haven't beenthe last four times.
647,00:28:23.20,00:28:23.20,"So if I'm not here, I wantyou three to kick some ass"
648,00:28:27.53,00:28:27.53,and make them goto Tribal Council.
649,00:28:29.17,00:28:29.17,I feel exactly the same way.
650,00:28:30.87,00:28:30.87,"I mean, who knowswhere this game's going to go?"
651,00:28:33.40,00:28:33.40,The only thing I knowis this is our last time
652,00:28:35.80,00:28:35.80,"for the four of usto be together, and I hate that."
653,00:28:38.77,00:28:38.77,Maybe the four of usshould sleep together tonight.
654,00:28:45.73,00:28:45.73,That sounds almost... erotic.
655,00:28:48.70,00:28:48.70,(laughs)
656,00:28:50.03,00:28:50.03,I'm kidding.
657,00:28:53.27,00:28:53.27,"Well, it's got to be..."
658,00:28:54.70,00:28:54.70,"you know,it's going to get tricky."
659,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,Let me keep my relationshipwith Brian.
660,00:28:59.40,00:28:59.40,"And I'm tryingto develop one with Clay,"
661,00:29:01.83,00:29:01.83,so let me try to keep them.
662,00:29:03.73,00:29:03.73,Y'all develop them how...how you can.
663,00:29:05.93,00:29:05.93,"Whatever we dofrom this point forward,"
664,00:29:08.67,00:29:08.67,just... just rememberthat's where it is.
665,00:29:11.50,00:29:11.50,No matter what happens.
666,00:29:15.13,00:29:15.13,And no matterwhat it looks like...
667,00:29:18.67,00:29:18.67,...our team's loyal.
668,00:29:21.20,00:29:21.20,We're loyal.
669,00:29:35.33,00:29:35.33,"All right, we're going to saya few words about this chicken."
670,00:29:39.30,00:29:39.30,"This is Lucky, who's beenwith us a number of days."
671,00:29:44.50,00:29:44.50,TED: I didn't grow up on a farm.
672,00:29:46.23,00:29:46.23, I'm not a hunter.
673,00:29:47.87,00:29:47.87," You know, I really didn't want to see the process"
674,00:29:50.40,00:29:50.40," of, uh, bringing Lucky to the dinner table..."
675,00:29:52.90,00:29:52.90,because I was basically lookingat Lucky as... as a pet.
676,00:29:55.67,00:29:55.67," And if it was up to me, I would let Lucky go free."
677,00:29:58.80,00:29:58.80,"You know, in, uh, Buddhistphilosophy, the Dalai Lama--"
678,00:30:02.43,00:30:02.43,"he said, ""This chicken's darma"
679,00:30:05.13,00:30:05.13,"is to give sustenanceto the rest of us."""
680,00:30:09.07,00:30:09.07,"CLAY: You know, I was raised around farms"
681,00:30:10.50,00:30:10.50," and-and ranches, and..."
682,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,I've never seen such a ceremony
683,00:30:13.57,00:30:13.57,over killing a damn chickenin my life.
684,00:30:15.73,00:30:15.73," There's animals put on here for us to eat,"
685,00:30:17.73,00:30:17.73," and, uh... hell, kill 'em and eat 'em."
686,00:30:19.53,00:30:19.53,It's not that big a deal.
687,00:30:21.27,00:30:21.27,"The chicken eats the grain,and then we eat the chicken,"
688,00:30:25.43,00:30:25.43,"so with that,we say to this chicken,"
689,00:30:28.60,00:30:28.60,thank you for giving your life.
690,00:30:29.93,00:30:29.93,And we should have a prayerof thanksgiving
691,00:30:33.53,00:30:33.53,at the time we actually eatthe chicken today.
692,00:30:37.30,00:30:37.30,"So, chicken, thank youfor giving your life."
693,00:30:40.23,00:30:40.23,(snapping)
694,00:30:46.80,00:30:46.80,(chicken flapping)
695,00:30:48.47,00:30:48.47,(snapping)
696,00:30:52.03,00:30:52.03,(rapid flapping)
697,00:31:00.30,00:31:00.30,"Now, that's just the last-minutemuscle twitches of death."
698,00:31:03.70,00:31:03.70,JAN: I had never participated
699,00:31:05.33,00:31:05.33,"in wringing a chicken's neck,"
700,00:31:08.30,00:31:08.30," and holding the legs and watching it flap,"
701,00:31:10.83,00:31:10.83," which was very hard for me'cause I'm very tender-hearted,"
702,00:31:13.97,00:31:13.97,"but it had a purpose,and the purpose was to feed us,"
703,00:31:16.90,00:31:16.90,so it was not a senseless death.
704,00:31:20.27,00:31:20.27,-Can I take these?-Sure.
705,00:31:26.20,00:31:26.20,(sniffling)
706,00:31:27.77,00:31:27.77,"Um, I'm buryingLucky's head and feet"
707,00:31:31.53,00:31:31.53,in my little pet cemetery.
708,00:31:33.90,00:31:33.90,"JAN: I have a pet cemetery here,"
709,00:31:36.73,00:31:36.73," and it started with Oliver, the little bat that I found,"
710,00:31:39.60,00:31:39.60,"and then, today, I added, uh..."
711,00:31:41.10,00:31:41.10,"uh, Lucky's headand Lucky's feet."
712,00:31:43.27,00:31:43.27,I'll put them right here byOliver so they can be friends.
713,00:31:46.60,00:31:46.60,"Of course, my team thinksI'm crazy, but that's okay."
714,00:31:50.40,00:31:50.40,(sniffles)
715,00:31:51.57,00:31:51.57,Didn't know my cemeterywould be so active
716,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,"while I was here,but it has been."
717,00:31:55.73,00:31:55.73," It was just to say thank you and, you know,"
718,00:31:59.10,00:31:59.10," ""Y'all look after each other."""
719,00:32:00.53,00:32:00.53," And so, of course, that did make me cry,"
720,00:32:03.30,00:32:03.30,but I'm happy they're together.
721,00:32:04.93,00:32:04.93,"(sniffles)Okay, good luck."
722,00:32:06.97,00:32:06.97,There's more meat on here
723,00:32:08.20,00:32:08.20,than I thoughtthere was going to be.
724,00:32:09.97,00:32:09.97,"Oh, my God,that smells so good."
725,00:32:12.67,00:32:12.67,That brothis out of this world.
726,00:32:13.87,00:32:13.87,"Oh, yeah."
727,00:32:15.07,00:32:15.07,"Man, Lucky really tastes good."
728,00:32:17.87,00:32:17.87,"Thank you, Lucky."
729,00:32:19.03,00:32:19.03,I got a kiss from Clay Jordan.
730,00:32:20.70,00:32:20.70,"Oh, my God,am I queen for a day."
731,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90,"-Mmm. -No doubt. -We mighteven have supper here, guys."
732,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,"'Cause, you know,if you guys are going"
733,00:32:26.73,00:32:26.73,"to Tribal Council,you're getting back late."
734,00:32:28.33,00:32:28.33,You can either eat before you goor eat when you get back.
735,00:32:38.10,00:32:38.10,(thunder rumbling)
736,00:32:43.47,00:32:43.47,"Oops.I forgot to yell, ""Fore."""
737,00:32:48.53,00:32:48.53,"Here we are,the final four of Sook Jai."
738,00:32:51.87,00:32:51.87,Somebody's got to go.
739,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,Nobody wants anybody to go.
740,00:32:56.60,00:32:56.60,"Now, do we want to go aheadand reveal who's going tonight,"
741,00:33:01.70,00:33:01.70,or had you rather just do itat the Tribal Council?
742,00:33:10.03,00:33:10.03,ERIN: It makes me sickthinking about this.
743,00:33:12.97,00:33:12.97,It makes us all sickthinking about it.
744,00:33:14.63,00:33:14.63,"I mean, look how farwe've come together."
745,00:33:16.53,00:33:16.53,"24 days, and we've allbeen so close."
746,00:33:21.80,00:33:21.80,"This is the real, true, hard one"
747,00:33:24.90,00:33:24.90,"-because I love all you guys.-Oh, God."
748,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,"-I love y'all, too.-I love all y'all, too."
749,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,I'll-I'll tell you...I'll tell you...
750,00:33:28.80,00:33:28.80,"-anyone of you wants to know.-I love all of you, too."
751,00:33:30.97,00:33:30.97,Wouldn't you knowit'd start raining when we get
752,00:33:32.70,00:33:32.70,"-right here, huh?-Good Lord's crying with us."
753,00:33:35.13,00:33:35.13,"Yeah, he is crying with us."
754,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,"Yo, let's get inout of the rain,"
755,00:33:39.00,00:33:39.00,'cause we're going to befreezing later.
756,00:33:52.03,00:33:52.03,"JAKE: If it was you,would you want to know?"
757,00:33:53.90,00:33:53.90,I think I'd want to know
758,00:33:56.53,00:33:56.53,'cause I wouldn't wantto be shocked.
759,00:34:00.00,00:34:00.00,-How about you?-I don't know how I feel.
760,00:34:03.43,00:34:03.43,How about you?
761,00:34:04.93,00:34:04.93,I would only want to knowif everybody's
762,00:34:06.93,00:34:06.93,in agreement that that'swhat we're going to do.
763,00:34:09.47,00:34:09.47,It's got to be unanimous--that's how...
764,00:34:10.97,00:34:10.97,that's how I feelabout stuff like this.
765,00:34:12.90,00:34:12.90,"PENNY: Well, let's just save itfor Tribal Council, then."
766,00:34:16.33,00:34:16.33,Yeah.
767,00:34:18.37,00:34:18.37,Is that the waywe're going to do it?
768,00:34:20.50,00:34:20.50,"Tribal Council,we'll just find out?"
769,00:34:23.27,00:34:23.27,All right.
770,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,"-All right.-God, I love you guys."
771,00:34:26.73,00:34:26.73,"-I love you guys, too.-Love you, too."
772,00:34:29.73,00:34:29.73,"You're special, special,special people."
773,00:34:36.50,00:34:36.50,"Oh, it just sucks'cause this is the fourth time"
774,00:34:38.83,00:34:38.83,in a row that we're going.
775,00:34:41.63,00:34:41.63,"You know, you'd like to see themhave to experience this."
776,00:34:44.80,00:34:44.80,JAKE: It's tough
777,00:34:46.50,00:34:46.50,when you have to votesomebody off that you love...
778,00:34:50.80,00:34:50.80,and you've been through a lotof stuff with.
779,00:34:52.97,00:34:52.97,And all of us feel that way.
780,00:34:54.93,00:34:54.93,Every one of us.Every last one of us.
781,00:35:00.23,00:35:00.23,Thank you very much.
782,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,"-Hey, guys.-We'll see each other soon."
783,00:35:04.90,00:35:04.90,-Good luck.-Thanks.
784,00:35:06.87,00:35:06.87,"Good luck, Erin. All right?"
785,00:35:08.93,00:35:08.93,Good luck.
786,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,-No shame.-Okay.
787,00:35:13.10,00:35:13.10,See you a little later.
788,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,"Good luck, everybody."
789,00:35:15.77,00:35:15.77,Very nice meetingevery single one of you.
790,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50,KEN: I kind of laughed to myself.
791,00:35:19.30,00:35:19.30,"This is a game,and I'm fighting back tears?"
792,00:35:21.90,00:35:21.90, I used to compare this to Monopoly.
793,00:35:23.63,00:35:23.63, This is nothing like Monopoly.
794,00:35:25.00,00:35:25.00, This is amazing.

798,00:35:31.87,00:35:31.87,"Bye, Penny. Bye, Jake."
799,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,-(sniffling) -Get this nicelittle group hug here.
800,00:35:45.40,00:35:45.40,"JAKE: Oh, you girls told menot to do that."
801,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47,(chuckling):I know.
802,00:35:49.47,00:35:49.47,I'm sorry.
803,00:35:51.83,00:35:51.83,TED: I do feel sad for Sook Jai.
804,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00," You know, at first,"
805,00:35:56.20,00:35:56.20,"we were like,""Well, hey, you know,"
806,00:35:58.40,00:35:58.40,"they're our competitors.It doesn't make any difference."""
807,00:36:01.23,00:36:01.23," But, you know, after living with them"
808,00:36:02.67,00:36:02.67,and getting to know them and...
809,00:36:04.07,00:36:04.07, it is a sad reality that one of them has to go.
810,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,"Welcome, guys."
811,00:36:26.67,00:36:26.67,I want to start firstjust by checking in on
812,00:36:29.43,00:36:29.43,what it's like back at camp.
813,00:36:31.73,00:36:31.73,I'm wonderingif you're starting to feel
814,00:36:33.73,00:36:33.73,"more like visitors, maybe,than residents."
815,00:36:36.50,00:36:36.50,Ken?
816,00:36:37.90,00:36:37.90,"Actually, it's quite theopposite: I feel more at home."
817,00:36:40.90,00:36:40.90,"Uh, each day that passes,I think that the, uh..."
818,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,the Chuay Gahn tribehas been very gracious.
819,00:36:46.07,00:36:46.07,They've just been phenomenal.
820,00:36:47.43,00:36:47.43,"They've accepted usinto their... into their home,"
821,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"and now it's our home.We're family,"
822,00:36:52.10,00:36:52.10,"and then, when we leaveto compete, we compete."
823,00:36:54.07,00:36:54.07,And it's-it's-it's...it's amazing
824,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,'cause it humanizesthe whole game
825,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,because now this personwho I'm talking to
826,00:37:00.57,00:37:00.57,"and laughing withand singing with right now,"
827,00:37:03.53,00:37:03.53,I know I'm going to becompeting against tomorrow.
828,00:37:06.40,00:37:06.40,Erin... diplomatic answer.
829,00:37:08.17,00:37:08.17,A little hard for meto believe that there's not
830,00:37:10.83,00:37:10.83,some feeling of... of weirdness
831,00:37:13.83,00:37:13.83,in a game that is oftencontrolled by numbers.
832,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,-What's it like for you?-We do feel
833,00:37:19.27,00:37:19.27,"like a large family,but the number game"
834,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,is really startingto catch up with us.
835,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,"For the majority of the game,"
836,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,"we have had, uh,strength in numbers."
837,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,"Now we're the underdogs,"
838,00:37:29.33,00:37:29.33,"and Chuay Gahn does havean advantage over us,"
839,00:37:31.57,00:37:31.57,but they don't make usfeel that way.
840,00:37:33.30,00:37:33.30,"Leaving for Tribal Counciltonight, they all walked us out."
841,00:37:35.37,00:37:35.37,They knew it was oneof the hardest things
842,00:37:37.23,00:37:37.23,that we've had to do.
843,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,"They walked us out,gave us big hugs,"
844,00:37:40.97,00:37:40.97,"told us all good luck and, uh,"
845,00:37:43.63,00:37:43.63,"you know, waved to us good-bye."
846,00:37:46.07,00:37:46.07,"Penny, what's the impact"
847,00:37:47.50,00:37:47.50,in terms of rolesor working around camp?
848,00:37:50.53,00:37:50.53,"Is there any feeling in the backof your mind that,"
849,00:37:53.33,00:37:53.33,"""I've got to workwith these guys a little bit"
850,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,"because I may need themlater in this game?"""
851,00:37:59.10,00:37:59.10,I definitely think so.
852,00:38:00.43,00:38:00.43,"Um, the first couple of days,we were like visitors."
853,00:38:03.47,00:38:03.47,It was like being guestsin someone's home.
854,00:38:06.07,00:38:06.07,You had to kind of learnhow they do their chores.
855,00:38:08.63,00:38:08.63,How do they sleep?How do they eat?
856,00:38:10.73,00:38:10.73,"But, you know, now it'skind of turned the opposite,"
857,00:38:13.80,00:38:13.80,where we're all sharingin the cooking
858,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"and the smashing of the leaves,"
859,00:38:18.13,00:38:18.13,and now we're startingto kind of team up
860,00:38:20.60,00:38:20.60,"and pair upwith the Chuay Gahn members,"
861,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,and I feel likewe're getting to know them
862,00:38:24.27,00:38:24.27,a lot betterthan the first couple days.
863,00:38:26.33,00:38:26.33,"Erin, why should they keep you?"
864,00:38:28.33,00:38:28.33,Why not justvote you out tonight?
865,00:38:29.77,00:38:29.77,I think they should keep me
866,00:38:31.17,00:38:31.17,because I feel likeI contribute to this tribe.
867,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,"I feel like I have, um..."
868,00:38:36.20,00:38:36.20,"haven't caused any,uh, turmoil or drama"
869,00:38:39.10,00:38:39.10,or hostility within the tribe.
870,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,I've been true to my word
871,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,"with each and every member,um, of Sook Jai."
872,00:38:45.63,00:38:45.63,And I feel likeI'm an asset to this tribe.
873,00:38:48.27,00:38:48.27,"PROBST:Penny, how about you?"
874,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,You could bea threat at this point.
875,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,"Even though we stillhave a tribe game,"
876,00:38:52.40,00:38:52.40,"at some point,I got to get rid of you"
877,00:38:54.13,00:38:54.13,if I want to win this thing.Why not tonight?
878,00:38:56.23,00:38:56.23,I help the tribe out.
879,00:38:57.87,00:38:57.87,"You know, I-I do my chores."
880,00:39:00.03,00:39:00.03,I don't just lay around
881,00:39:01.63,00:39:01.63,unless we're all laying aroundas a group.
882,00:39:04.10,00:39:04.10,I just don't go off on my ownand take little naps
883,00:39:06.57,00:39:06.57,unless the whole tribe is.
884,00:39:08.33,00:39:08.33,"Um, so I feel that I pullmy own weight as well."
885,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,"Jake, how about for you?Three younger people--"
886,00:39:14.10,00:39:14.10,"""Let's turn on the old guytonight and get rid of him."""
887,00:39:16.33,00:39:16.33,I'm probably the strongestof the teammates in the water.
888,00:39:19.20,00:39:19.20,So from any... anythingthat's got anything
889,00:39:21.17,00:39:21.17,"to do with the water,it's probably my bag,"
890,00:39:23.70,00:39:23.70,and I think mostof my teammates know that.
891,00:39:26.30,00:39:26.30,I'm an early riser.
892,00:39:28.17,00:39:28.17,"And I liketo get my chores done early,"
893,00:39:30.37,00:39:30.37,"and get everythingtaken care of,"
894,00:39:32.10,00:39:32.10,"so, I thinkI pull my own weight."
895,00:39:34.00,00:39:34.00,"How about for you, Ken?"
896,00:39:35.27,00:39:35.27,I think they should keep mebecause of the fact
897,00:39:37.43,00:39:37.43,that I am physicallystrong enough to get by.
898,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,"PROBST:Well, tonight's vote is big,"
899,00:39:44.00,00:39:44.00,because whoever is votedout tonight will become
900,00:39:45.87,00:39:45.87,the first member of our jury.
901,00:39:47.53,00:39:47.53,They'll have oneof the seven votes
902,00:39:49.03,00:39:49.03,that ultimately determineswho is the sole survivor.
903,00:39:52.47,00:39:52.47,They'll return to all futureTribal Councils
904,00:39:54.10,00:39:54.10,"to gather information,"
905,00:39:55.30,00:39:55.30,and they'll be a partof the final vote.
906,00:39:57.37,00:39:57.37,"So with that in mind,it is time to vote."
907,00:40:00.40,00:40:00.40,"Jake, you're first."
908,00:40:11.97,00:40:11.97,This is probably one ofthe most difficult votes
909,00:40:14.37,00:40:14.37,that I've ever had to do.
910,00:40:15.87,00:40:15.87,You've been a great tribe mate.
911,00:40:17.50,00:40:17.50,You've been a great companion.
912,00:40:37.53,00:40:37.53,I thinkyou've roughed it enough.
913,00:40:39.03,00:40:39.03,It seems likeit's beginning to wear on you.
914,00:40:49.30,00:40:49.30,I'll go tally the votes.
915,00:41:01.10,00:41:01.10,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
916,00:41:03.50,00:41:03.50,Person voted out will be asked
917,00:41:04.93,00:41:04.93,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
918,00:41:06.73,00:41:06.73,I'll read the votes.
919,00:41:12.73,00:41:12.73,First vote...
920,00:41:14.93,00:41:14.93,Ken.
921,00:41:20.10,00:41:20.10,Erin.
922,00:41:21.40,00:41:21.40,"That's one vote-- Erin,one vote-- Ken."
923,00:41:26.83,00:41:26.83,That's two votes-- Erin.
924,00:41:34.63,00:41:34.63,"The eighth person voted out,"
925,00:41:36.33,00:41:36.33,first member of our jury-- Erin.
926,00:41:40.90,00:41:40.90,You need to bring me your torch.
927,00:41:52.47,00:41:52.47,"Erin, the tribe has spoken."
928,00:41:56.57,00:41:56.57,It's time for you to go.
929,00:41:59.07,00:41:59.07,Good luck.
930,00:42:00.07,00:42:00.07,I love you guys.
931,00:42:01.50,00:42:01.50,I'm sorry.
932,00:42:06.47,00:42:06.47,Bye.
933,00:42:23.33,00:42:23.33,You guys arerunning out of members.
934,00:42:25.57,00:42:25.57,You're running out of time.
935,00:42:26.97,00:42:26.97,What you can'trun out of is hope.
936,00:42:29.27,00:42:29.27,Anything is possiblein this game.
937,00:42:32.10,00:42:32.10,"You need to go back to camp,try to get a good night's sleep."
938,00:42:35.13,00:42:35.13,Good night.
939,00:42:47.83,00:42:47.83, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
940,00:42:54.03,00:42:54.03,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor:
941,00:42:56.13,00:42:56.13, reminders of home strike an emotional cord.
942,00:42:58.70,00:42:58.70,Oh ...
943,00:43:00.70,00:43:00.70,"PROBST: But for one survivor,  it could backfire."
944,00:43:02.53,00:43:02.53,Brand-new cars in the garage--
945,00:43:04.03,00:43:04.03," that'd be enough to vote them off,"
946,00:43:05.43,00:43:05.43, because they don't need the money.
947,00:43:06.87,00:43:06.87,PROBST: And the scramble to the finish line begins.
948,00:43:09.43,00:43:09.43,They've been worried sincesquare one that I was a threat.
949,00:43:11.90,00:43:11.90,We've got to createa little bit of a stir.
950,00:43:18.87,00:43:18.87,I'm very happy the waythat I've played the game.
951,00:43:20.90,00:43:20.90,"My number one goal wasto make it to the jury,"
952,00:43:22.93,00:43:22.93,and I made it.
953,00:43:24.37,00:43:24.37," I wasn't predicting to get voted off tonight,"
954,00:43:26.47,00:43:26.47, but that's how the game is.
955,00:43:27.87,00:43:27.87," I came to Thailand with a small bag and myself,"
956,00:43:30.77,00:43:30.77, and I'm leaving with more than I ever could have expected.
957,00:43:33.77,00:43:33.77,I'm readyto sit back now and watch
958,00:43:35.27,00:43:35.27,"and see how the restof the game is played,"
959,00:43:37.20,00:43:37.20,because it's extremelyunpredictable.
