3,00:00:15.88,00:00:15.88,"Gabon, you'll get a fresh look at the survivors with"
4,00:00:19.88,00:00:19.88,"never-before-seen footage. >> If you get me, you're-you're"
5,00:00:23.29,00:00:23.29,"not offended by me. If you don't get me, you go"
6,00:00:26.54,00:00:26.54,"crying home to Mama. >> Oh, my God!"
7,00:00:29.12,00:00:29.12,(laughter) >> Oh!
8,00:00:32.12,00:00:32.12,>> I want to kill Sugar. I hate her.
9,00:00:34.17,00:00:34.17,>> I'm Sugar. >> PROBST: For the first time...
10,00:00:36.17,00:00:36.17,>> I'm a professional gamer. >> PROBST: ...watch the audition
11,00:00:38.17,00:00:38.17,tapes that turned the applicants into survivors.
12,00:00:40.58,00:00:40.58,>> I need a little pain. I need a little suffering.
13,00:00:44.21,00:00:44.21,>> PROBST: And follow the unlikely stories of how the
14,00:00:46.92,00:00:46.92,early underdogs came out on top. Kenny...
15,00:00:51.50,00:00:51.50,>> It comes down to brains versus brawn and I'm a huge-time
16,00:00:54.12,00:00:54.12,strategist. >> PROBST: Crystal...
17,00:00:56.12,00:00:56.12,">> The game is outwit, outlast. You can't outwit Crystal Cox,"
18,00:00:59.00,00:00:59.00,baby. >> PROBST: Bob...
19,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,>> My strategy is to be needed. That's going to get me further
20,00:01:03.42,00:01:03.42,on in the game. >> PROBST: Sugar...
21,00:01:05.42,00:01:05.42,>> I'm not too bad at this. (laughs)
22,00:01:07.42,00:01:07.42,I'm a lot better than I thought for sure.
23,00:01:09.62,00:01:09.62,>> PROBST: Susie... >> It's about knowing when to
24,00:01:11.67,00:01:11.67,"react. I mean, I really feel confident"
25,00:01:13.83,00:01:13.83,I know when to jump. >> PROBST: Matty...
26,00:01:15.83,00:01:15.83,>> This is by far the hardest thing I've ever done.
27,00:01:17.83,00:01:17.83,My whole driving force out here is Jamie; she's my girlfriend.
28,00:01:21.04,00:01:21.04,>> PROBST: And Corinne... >> I'm here 'cause I want to
29,00:01:23.04,00:01:23.04,win. I believe that I'll be in the
30,00:01:25.25,00:01:25.25,top three. >> PROBST: From the very first
31,00:01:29.04,00:01:29.04,"moments of the game, the Fang tribe set themselves up for"
32,00:01:31.92,00:01:31.92,failure with some odd choices during the schoolyard pick.
33,00:01:35.12,00:01:35.12,">> Susie, come on home! >> I knew it."
34,00:01:37.96,00:01:37.96,>> I'm going to pick the big homey with all the game right
35,00:01:40.29,00:01:40.29,there. >> PROBST: It was immediately
36,00:01:42.08,00:01:42.08,clear that Fang was physically weaker than Kota and this would
37,00:01:45.75,00:01:45.75,prove to be their demise... as Fang lost ten out of the next
38,00:01:50.96,00:01:50.96,14 challenges. Kota wins immunity!
39,00:01:54.12,00:01:54.12,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Kota wins immunity!
40,00:01:56.12,00:01:56.12,Kota scores! Kota!
41,00:01:58.17,00:01:58.17,Kota! Kota wins immunity and reward!
42,00:02:01.12,00:02:01.12,This is not even close. >> I'm starting to lose my
43,00:02:04.17,00:02:04.17,spirit. I'm starting to lose my hope.
44,00:02:06.25,00:02:06.25,We don't match up to Kota physically.
45,00:02:08.62,00:02:08.62,We don't match up to Kota mentally.
46,00:02:11.00,00:02:11.00,We don't match up to Kota. >> PROBST: The Fang tribe
47,00:02:14.38,00:02:14.38,bickered. >> Eat your rice.
48,00:02:16.04,00:02:16.04,"(mumbling) >> Randy, are you, like, the"
49,00:02:17.62,00:02:17.62,leader of the tribe now? >> Drop it.
50,00:02:19.25,00:02:19.25,">> I don't have to drop nothing, man."
51,00:02:21.04,00:02:21.04,I can ask you something if I want.
52,00:02:22.62,00:02:22.62,>> And I can just ignore you then.
53,00:02:24.62,00:02:24.62,">> PROBST: Michelle, the tribe has spoken."
54,00:02:26.62,00:02:26.62,And their tribe quickly dwindled.
55,00:02:28.21,00:02:28.21,Gillian. >> Bummer.
56,00:02:30.25,00:02:30.25,>> PROBST: Kota lost one member early on.
57,00:02:32.04,00:02:32.04,"Paloma, the tribe has spoken. But they remained rational and"
58,00:02:35.88,00:02:35.88,"united. >> All right, Marcus!"
59,00:02:38.88,00:02:38.88,(cheering) >> Our morale was super high.
60,00:02:41.88,00:02:41.88,We love our team. >> PROBST: Marcus artfully kept
61,00:02:45.21,00:02:45.21,things together... >> And away we go.
62,00:02:47.21,00:02:47.21,">> PROBST: ...and made a solid early alliance with Charlie,"
63,00:02:49.21,00:02:49.21,"Corinne, and Jacquie. These four looked poised to go"
64,00:02:53.25,00:02:53.25,all the way to the end. But it's not always the obvious
65,00:02:56.54,00:02:56.54,front-runner that comes out on top.
66,00:03:00.08,00:03:00.08,Marcus drops a pole. He's out of the challenge.
67,00:03:02.33,00:03:02.33,And amazingly... The tribe has spoken.
68,00:03:04.33,00:03:04.33,"...out of this early powerhouse alliance, only Corinne made it"
69,00:03:07.96,00:03:07.96,to the final seven. What are you about to see is the
70,00:03:11.96,00:03:11.96,story of a quiet group of underdogs who slowly finessed
71,00:03:15.04,00:03:15.04,their games and ended up on top. (theme song playing)

103,00:05:46.12,00:05:46.12,Grew up pretty poor. Still am pretty poor.
104,00:05:48.29,00:05:48.29,I've always exuded confidence. I'm-I'm always fun to be around.
105,00:05:51.04,00:05:51.04,"Anyway, please call me. Um, I do want to bring my"
106,00:05:53.33,00:05:53.33,tweezers because I don't want to have a hairy mustache and

113,00:06:12.12,00:06:12.12,my tournaments. What separates me from the
114,00:06:14.17,00:06:14.17,losers are my mind games. I can out-predict everyone so
115,00:06:17.00,00:06:17.00,well that I'm always one step ahead of them.
116,00:06:20.21,00:06:20.21,">> Hey, I'm Corinne. And I'm a graduate of the"

119,00:06:28.96,00:06:28.96,I've got two tactics. One: flirtation.
120,00:06:31.54,00:06:31.54,The second tactic is manipulation.
121,00:06:34.33,00:06:34.33,"Oh, and one more thing... I'm a risk taker."
122,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,I always jump into the deep end of the pool.

127,00:06:56.38,00:06:56.38,thing that-that I could do for myself.
128,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,I would like to eat some snails and raw fish and bugs and
129,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,whatever it takes and... Come on in.

134,00:07:16.12,00:07:16.12,I love my girl and my boy. My hard-core physical training.
135,00:07:20.12,00:07:20.12,My hard-core philosophy. It takes focus and discipline
136,00:07:24.25,00:07:24.25,because living a dream here in paradise only gets you so far.
137,00:07:27.79,00:07:27.79,I need a little pain. I need a little suffering.

150,00:08:24.42,00:08:24.42,Don't even think about it. Close your eyes.
151,00:08:26.46,00:08:26.46,Don't even think about it. There's a fruit that we found in

158,00:08:55.42,00:08:55.42,was gross. It was by far one of the

190,00:10:25.33,00:10:25.33,">> PROBST: At Kota, Marcus, Corinne, Charlie, and Jacquie"
191,00:10:29.33,00:10:29.33,"were running the show, and they had Bob in their back pocket."

193,00:10:36.33,00:10:36.33,"We're all in your boat. As long as, you know, you feel"
194,00:10:38.54,00:10:38.54,"the same way we do, we're all in it together."
195,00:10:41.00,00:10:41.00,Here's the deal: these are the four; you're the fifth.
196,00:10:43.00,00:10:43.00,That's all you need to know. It's the majority; that's it.
197,00:10:44.96,00:10:44.96,So lock it down. That's it.
198,00:10:47.12,00:10:47.12,>> That's a good point. >> PROBST: And when Kota won yet
199,00:10:50.42,00:10:50.42,another challenge... Kota wins immunity and reward!
200,00:10:54.04,00:10:54.04,...they sent Dan from Fang to be the first to visit Exile
201,00:10:57.08,00:10:57.08,"Island. But this time, Exile Island was"
202,00:11:00.38,00:11:00.38,different. Dan had a choice between getting
203,00:11:02.67,00:11:02.67,a clue to the hidden immunity idol or spending the time there
204,00:11:06.17,00:11:06.17,"in idle comfort. Dan chose the clue, but his"
205,00:11:10.00,00:11:10.00,search for the idol came up empty.
206,00:11:12.38,00:11:12.38,">> I'm tired. I'm thirsty, hungry, and I"
207,00:11:15.79,00:11:15.79,"cannot find this immunity idol. >> PROBST: At Kota, there was"
208,00:11:19.79,00:11:19.79,love in the air. >> So Marcus and Jacquie always
209,00:11:30.92,00:11:30.92,"go off together and have become the couple of our tribe, which"
210,00:11:36.58,00:11:36.58,is a problem. Because any time you are in a
211,00:11:40.08,00:11:40.08,"romantic involvement with somebody else, it puts a target"
212,00:11:42.12,00:11:42.12,"on your back. Honestly, every time you go off"
213,00:11:44.08,00:11:44.08,"with Jacquie, everyone makes comments."
214,00:11:45.58,00:11:45.58,">> Do they? Dude, is that why...?"
215,00:11:47.12,00:11:47.12,">> Yes. Yesterday, you guys were standing at the end of the dock."
216,00:11:49.12,00:11:49.12,"They were like, ""Do you think they would agree to just get"
217,00:11:51.12,00:11:51.12,"married at the end of the dock right there?"""
218,00:11:53.08,00:11:53.08,"Yeah, you got some problems. You need to watch yourself."
219,00:11:55.17,00:11:55.17,I have no intention of staying with them if they continue
220,00:11:57.50,00:11:57.50,this behavior. It's just not...
221,00:11:59.42,00:11:59.42,It's bad business. (hoots)

223,00:12:05.12,00:12:05.12,Fang wins reward! (cheering)
224,00:12:08.00,00:12:08.00,...they sent Sugar to Exile Island.
225,00:12:10.25,00:12:10.25,>> I knew that. >> PROBST: How did you know
226,00:12:12.04,00:12:12.04,that? >> I knew that they were going
227,00:12:14.21,00:12:14.21,to pick me because they think I'm dumb.
228,00:12:16.62,00:12:16.62,>> PROBST: Some of Sugar's tribe mates had little faith
229,00:12:19.46,00:12:19.46,she would survive on Exile. >> She's not going to be able
230,00:12:22.00,00:12:22.00,to find it. She just... She's a pinup.
231,00:12:24.04,00:12:24.04,Her name's Sugar. I think Sugar on Exile Island is
232,00:12:27.12,00:12:27.12,doing about as bad as anybody can be doing on Exile.
233,00:12:29.46,00:12:29.46,"She is so, like, clutching her knees, rocking back and forth,"
234,00:12:31.83,00:12:31.83,hysterically crying. She has an attempted hope for
235,00:12:34.67,00:12:34.67,the idol. She's probably this close from a
236,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,complete meltdown. If not already in the throes of
237,00:12:40.67,00:12:40.67,a meltdown. >> PROBST: But Corinne
238,00:12:45.29,00:12:45.29,underestimated the will of the pinup model.

240,00:12:50.08,00:12:50.08,">> PROBST: And just like that, Sugar had become the most"
241,00:12:52.12,00:12:52.12,"powerful player in the game. >> When Fang sent me to Exile,"
242,00:12:56.83,00:12:56.83,I thought maybe they thought I was dumb and that I'd never find
243,00:12:59.67,00:12:59.67,"the idol, no way. I can't believe I found it and"
244,00:13:03.25,00:13:03.25,the lawyer didn't. How funny is that?
245,00:13:05.79,00:13:05.79,That's funny. >> PROBST: Coming up in a new
246,00:13:09.04,00:13:09.04,scene: an adventure for Kota is no picnic for Corinne.
247,00:13:12.88,00:13:12.88,>> I'd rather be serving up poison to these people.
248,00:13:15.04,00:13:15.04,"I hate these people. (bird squawks, rhino snorts)"

250,00:13:28.04,00:13:28.04,"closest ally, in on her secret. >> I just had a very nice"
251,00:13:39.25,00:13:39.25,"conversation in the canoe, being told that Sugar has the immunity"
252,00:13:42.12,00:13:42.12,"idol, and we're going to, hopefully, dominate this game."

254,00:13:55.62,00:13:55.62,were running out of rice. >> Seen the rice?
255,00:13:58.58,00:13:58.58,"We're over halfway done. I will... I will make my speech,"
256,00:14:03.08,00:14:03.08,"and then I'm going to shut up, and you guys can decide, but we"
257,00:14:05.96,00:14:05.96,need to be eating one meal a day. Period.
258,00:14:08.46,00:14:08.46,We're all going to be hungry. That's why it's called Survivor.
259,00:14:13.25,00:14:13.25,">> PROBST: With tension still in the air, good-natured Matty"
260,00:14:16.46,00:14:16.46,tried to lighten things up with a heartfelt song honoring his

267,00:14:32.25,00:14:32.25,>> I like Matty. He just is a cool kid. He's a...
268,00:14:34.21,00:14:34.21,"Reminds me a lot of my little brother, but sometimes I think"
269,00:14:37.00,00:14:37.00,"Matty seems a little insecure. >> Ready, one, two, three."

276,00:15:06.96,00:15:06.96,anxiety-ridden. I got to really address that

278,00:15:13.17,00:15:13.17,Have you had much tragedy in your life?
279,00:15:18.58,00:15:18.58,"Uh, I mean, everything. You know, one-one tops the"
280,00:15:22.25,00:15:22.25,"other. My dog, Johnson, uh, meant more"

286,00:15:43.17,00:15:43.17,done is deal with it. I'm not the nicest guy in the
287,00:15:45.92,00:15:45.92,"world. I've had a tough 49 years, but,"
288,00:15:49.00,00:15:49.00,"uh, Matty knows, if you get me, you're not offended by me."
289,00:15:52.96,00:15:52.96,"If you don't get me, you go crying home to Mama."

300,00:16:28.00,00:16:28.00,">> No! >> No. No, no, no, no!"

306,00:16:43.83,00:16:43.83,I was happy. I was comfortable with that

309,00:16:52.00,00:16:52.00,That was just such a buzz-kill. I didn't even want to hear that.

557,00:30:45.50,00:30:45.50,"my number one ally, just so you can go farther in the game, I'm"
558,00:30:50.29,00:30:50.29,not pleased at all. >> PROBST: Then Marcus had a
559,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,chat with Susie. >> My thought was tonight Ken
560,00:30:56.58,00:30:56.58,"and then, if hopefully we don't have to go for a while, but then"
561,00:30:59.71,00:30:59.71,Crystal will be next. >> PROBST: But Crystal told
562,00:31:01.79,00:31:01.79,Kenny about Marcus's plan. >> What do you mean?
563,00:31:07.33,00:31:07.33,"What do you mean? >> PROBST: And all of sudden,"
564,00:31:09.38,00:31:09.38,Susie was the key.  >> I have a huge decision to
565,00:31:21.17,00:31:21.17,"make tonight on which way to go, either Marcus or Bob, or I can"
566,00:31:24.71,00:31:24.71,vote with Kenny and Crystal. >> PROBST: And that night at
567,00:31:30.12,00:31:30.12,"Tribal Council, the person responsible for dumping the"
568,00:31:32.92,00:31:32.92,idol now needed it and was voted out.
569,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,"Ninth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon, and the first"
570,00:31:39.21,00:31:39.21,member of our jury.... Marcus.
571,00:31:48.42,00:31:48.42,"At the next reward challenge, Fang was in shock that Marcus"
572,00:31:51.50,00:31:51.50,was gone. >> He didn't deserve to leave
573,00:31:53.54,00:31:53.54,the game. >> PROBST: And Kenny's
574,00:31:55.50,00:31:55.50,confidence was growing. >> Then who does?
575,00:31:57.92,00:31:57.92,Who does deserve to leave the game?
576,00:32:00.04,00:32:00.04,>> I could not believe they had gotten rid of Marcus.
577,00:32:02.50,00:32:02.50,"It was so heartbreaking, just because that really damages my"
578,00:32:05.71,00:32:05.71,chances at the game. >> PROBST: But Fang won the
579,00:32:08.46,00:32:08.46,"challenge. >> Hey, we won!"
580,00:32:12.21,00:32:12.21,>> PROBST: And Bob was sent to Exile Island.
581,00:32:14.88,00:32:14.88,"Bob, grab your stuff. (shouting)"
582,00:32:18.29,00:32:18.29,Matty and his tribe enjoyed some real African culture and
583,00:32:21.33,00:32:21.33,food at a local village in Gabon.
584,00:32:25.21,00:32:25.21,">> I know. >> PROBST: While over on Exile,"
585,00:32:28.21,00:32:28.21,"Bob searched for the idol, not knowing that Sugar already had"
586,00:32:31.54,00:32:31.54,it. >> The fourth clue got me
587,00:32:33.88,00:32:33.88,completely perplexed. >> PROBST: Bob decided he
588,00:32:36.58,00:32:36.58,"couldn't leave Exile Island empty-handed, so he made his"
589,00:32:39.08,00:32:39.08,first major strategic move. >> I'm going to make something
590,00:32:42.29,00:32:42.29,that looks like an idol so that they think I have an idol.
591,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,Sort of like when you're holding up a bank.
592,00:32:47.58,00:32:47.58,"You don't necessarily need the gun, but if they think you've"
593,00:32:50.08,00:32:50.08,"got a gun, they might leave you alone."
594,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"This is my new fake idol. >> PROBST: Coming up, Randy"
595,00:33:00.75,00:33:00.75,"stirs up trouble around camp. >> Desperate times, man, call"
596,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,"for desperate measures. >> Shut up, Randy."
597,00:33:05.54,00:33:05.54,You're being a lunatic. >> PROBST: At the next immunity
598,00:33:14.17,00:33:14.17,"challenge, the merge was finally announced."
599,00:33:17.79,00:33:17.79,"Your merge. >> Oh, wow!"
600,00:33:19.67,00:33:19.67,>> Yes! >> PROBST: And Susie surprised
601,00:33:21.83,00:33:21.83,everyone by winning immunity. >> Yes!
602,00:33:24.88,00:33:24.88,>> PROBST: Susie wins immunity! Back at the newly merged camp...
603,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,>> People bounced into the jungle and started their
604,00:33:30.54,00:33:30.54,strategies. >> PROBST: ...Charlie and Randy
605,00:33:32.54,00:33:32.54,were gunning for Crystal. >> Crystal's the way to go.
606,00:33:35.46,00:33:35.46,Bob will vote Crystal. >> PROBST: With Sugar in the
607,00:33:40.33,00:33:40.33,"middle, Corinne and Charlie tried to convince her to vote"
608,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,with the old Kota. >> Yeah. I'm...
609,00:33:47.42,00:33:47.42,>> We can do Randy next. >> PROBST: What Charlie didn't
610,00:33:50.21,00:33:50.21,"know was that Matty, Susie, Crystal, and Kenny had a"
611,00:33:53.46,00:33:53.46,different victim in mind. >> This is some real.
612,00:33:55.79,00:33:55.79,This is the realness over here. >> Write down Charlie.
613,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,"Write down Charlie. >> Charlie, Charlie, Charlie."
614,00:34:01.96,00:34:01.96,>> PROBST: And Kenny tried to pull Sugar over to his side.
615,00:34:04.54,00:34:04.54,>> Charlie is the brains behind all of it.
616,00:34:07.12,00:34:07.12,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Knowing the vote was
617,00:34:09.29,00:34:09.29,"in her hands, Sugar had to decide whether to go with her"
618,00:34:12.38,00:34:12.38,"old tribe or her new allies, who promised to take her to the end."
619,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,"And that night at Tribal Council, Sugar's vote sealed the"
620,00:34:21.21,00:34:21.21,"deal, and the early underdogs suddenly became the clear"
621,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,frontrunners in the game. Tenth person voted out of
622,00:34:27.42,00:34:27.42,Survivor: Gabon... Charlie.
623,00:34:32.75,00:34:32.75,"With Charlie gone, Bob, Randy, and Corinne found themselves in"
624,00:34:37.50,00:34:37.50,the minority of a tribe led by Sugar.
625,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,>> Even though I don't like the way you've been talking--
626,00:34:42.88,00:34:42.88,negative and everything--  I thought maybe you could learn
627,00:34:45.04,00:34:45.04,from me by telling you and-and...
628,00:34:47.12,00:34:47.12,>> Let your countenance be your light.
629,00:34:49.04,00:34:49.04,">> Yeah, a little bit. I know that sounds stupid,"
630,00:34:51.17,00:34:51.17,though. >> But that's how some people
631,00:34:53.00,00:34:53.00,"need to learn. >> Right, so I'm just letting"
632,00:34:55.38,00:34:55.38,"you know that I hate the way you've been, but-but I know that"
633,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,you're not a bad person. You just got a little out of
634,00:35:02.92,00:35:02.92,"hand. >> So this morning, I'm in the"
635,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,"hut, and Sugar decides that she's going to teach me a"
636,00:35:08.75,00:35:08.75,lesson about life. >> We had one good conversation.
637,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,"The rest the time, it was you and Randy talking about"
638,00:35:16.25,00:35:16.25,everybody else. And it's just...
639,00:35:18.25,00:35:18.25,"It's a negative way of being, and it was happening so much,"
640,00:35:21.58,00:35:21.58,"I was just like, ""Oh, my God. It's like cancer in my ears."""
641,00:35:24.67,00:35:24.67,"It's, like, all the complaints. Nothing was good enough."
642,00:35:26.96,00:35:26.96,"It was horrible. Okay, I don't want to keep"
643,00:35:30.12,00:35:30.12,harping on it. I just want you to realize that
644,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,"everything that you say is-is noted, you know, and-and..."
645,00:35:35.96,00:35:35.96,>> All right. >> You know?
646,00:35:39.08,00:35:39.08,"Okay, cool. I'm sorry."
647,00:35:40.79,00:35:40.79,I just wanted to... to talk to you about it.
648,00:35:43.50,00:35:43.50,>> From a girl who is-- I'm sorry-- a non-college-graduate
649,00:35:47.79,00:35:47.79,waitress who's out of work. She doesn't even have a waitress
650,00:35:51.58,00:35:51.58,"job. She lives off the ""kindness"" of"
651,00:35:54.04,00:35:54.04,others. I don't like people that live
652,00:35:56.21,00:35:56.21,off the kindness of others. There is no honor in that.
653,00:35:59.46,00:35:59.46,Just more like a second to vent. I want to kill Sugar.
654,00:36:02.08,00:36:02.08,I hate her. >> She's horrible.
655,00:36:03.67,00:36:03.67,">> You don't understand. She pulls me into the tent, and"
656,00:36:05.88,00:36:05.88,"she's like, ""I know that you were making fun of me, and I"
657,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,"know what you and Randy said, and you don't even know me, and"
658,00:36:10.75,00:36:10.75,I want to teach you about forgiveness and about how being
659,00:36:12.67,00:36:12.67,"nice to people is better than being mean."""
660,00:36:14.50,00:36:14.50,"So I was, like, ""You know, I don't have any friends."
661,00:36:16.58,00:36:16.58,"You're the only person I have left."""
662,00:36:18.79,00:36:18.79,"I'm sitting there, like, cringing."
663,00:36:20.42,00:36:20.42,"Like, ""Really, bitch, you're going to teach me something?"
664,00:36:22.21,00:36:22.21,"I'm gonna teach you something."" >> She's the worst person in the"
665,00:36:24.33,00:36:24.33,world. It's people like that that are
666,00:36:26.29,00:36:26.29,"so self-righteous... >> Oh! Oh, my God!"
667,00:36:28.21,00:36:28.21,>> ...and high-and-mighty that are a million times more evil
668,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,than me. >> My favorite... My favorite
669,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,"is, like, she's so stupid... >> That it's dangerous."
670,00:36:34.33,00:36:34.33,">> Yes! And I'm just, like... I never complained."
671,00:36:36.54,00:36:36.54,She's the one who keep... She's always complaining about
672,00:36:38.58,00:36:38.58,where she sleeps. She's complaining about where
673,00:36:40.58,00:36:40.58,she's sitting. I won't... I can't even...
674,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,I just... You don't understand.
675,00:36:44.17,00:36:44.17,"All that gets me through the day is, I've rehearsed the speech"
676,00:36:46.88,00:36:46.88,I'm gonna give after they say my name at Tribal.
677,00:36:48.71,00:36:48.71,"I'm gonna turn on her and be, like, ""You know what the best"
678,00:36:51.04,00:36:51.04,part about going home is? I don't have to pretend to like
679,00:36:53.21,00:36:53.21,"you anymore."" >> Exactly."
680,00:36:55.04,00:36:55.04,">> I'm gonna be nasty at Tribal. >> Yeah, I know."
681,00:36:57.08,00:36:57.08,">> Oh, there. Go, go, go, go."
682,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,"At the very least, I have the jury."
683,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,"We'll give the million to who we want to give the million to,"
684,00:37:06.04,00:37:06.04,"and trust that won't be Sugar. I don't know who it will be,"
685,00:37:08.88,00:37:08.88,"but it won't be Sugar. So, her little teaching me a"
686,00:37:11.21,00:37:11.21,lesson? Really?
687,00:37:13.04,00:37:13.04,"This is how the lesson goes, bitch."

690,00:37:22.71,00:37:22.71,"I made a fake one. >> Oh, my God."
691,00:37:24.75,00:37:24.75,That's awesome. >> PROBST: At the next reward
692,00:37:27.75,00:37:27.75,"challenge, a Survivor auction was full of surprises."

696,00:37:38.00,00:37:38.00,"I'm sorry, Bob. >> PROBST: Bob, get your"
697,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,personal items. You're going back to Exile
698,00:37:41.75,00:37:41.75,Island. You will return in time for the
699,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,next immunity challenge. And Randy thought he'd soften
700,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,his image with a plate of cookies.
701,00:37:48.25,00:37:48.25,>> $20. >> PROBST: Sold to Randy.

705,00:37:57.83,00:37:57.83,Corinne? >> Sugar doesn't have one.
706,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,"I offered her one, and she didn't take one."
707,00:38:02.04,00:38:02.04,>> PROBST: But he couldn't charm Sugar.
708,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,>> Last chance. You can have a full one.
709,00:38:06.12,00:38:06.12,>> PROBST: And he lost his last cookie when Sugar snatched it up
710,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,and gave it to Matty. >> That cookie's tainted.

716,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,drunk and pissed off. >> PROBST: Unaware that Sugar
717,00:38:26.71,00:38:26.71,"had the hidden immunity idol, Randy bet on Bob finding the"
718,00:38:29.25,00:38:29.25,"idol at Exile and giving it to him, so he cooked up a"

724,00:38:49.58,00:38:49.58,made himself irritating to get people to vote for him.
