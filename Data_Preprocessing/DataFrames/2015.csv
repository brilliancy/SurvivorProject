46,00:02:22.17,00:02:22.17,But social game? No. Physical game?
47,00:02:26.12,00:02:26.12,Maybe the worst physical player to ever play the game.

86,00:04:07.25,00:04:07.25,Our show is very clearly defined in that you have a
87,00:04:09.71,00:04:09.71,"group of people, you put them in one situation."
88,00:04:12.38,00:04:12.38,"You vote out people, and in the end the last group, that jury,"

90,00:04:17.54,00:04:17.54,This isn't a game in which you include America.
91,00:04:19.38,00:04:19.38,That's a different game. >> Otherwise I would have won.
92,00:04:21.21,00:04:21.21,>> PROBST: So you haven't won this game.
93,00:04:22.96,00:04:22.96,"Maybe you would win that game. Sandra, what was your key move?"
94,00:04:26.62,00:04:26.62,Was there one move that you look back on and say if this
95,00:04:28.75,00:04:28.75,"hadn't happened, might not have gotten there?"
96,00:04:31.25,00:04:31.25,">> I have a ton of moves, Jeff. Like I've always said, I was a"

99,00:04:39.58,00:04:39.58,"use it to my knowledge and to my ability, and I learned from"
100,00:04:42.75,00:04:42.75,every season what mistakes not to make and how to proceed in
101,00:04:46.04,00:04:46.04,the game. So I take it day by day.

106,00:05:03.25,00:05:03.25,times. She has never been voted out
107,00:05:05.21,00:05:05.21,"of this game. On the other hand, in all the"
108,00:05:08.25,00:05:08.25,"times she's played, she's never won a single challenge."
109,00:05:11.04,00:05:11.04,Even beloved Courtney has won a challenge.

114,00:05:22.29,00:05:22.29,this game? >> I've always said the game is
115,00:05:26.25,00:05:26.25,"a third physical, a third strategic and social, and it's"
116,00:05:29.75,00:05:29.75,a third luck. A lot of luck comes into it.
117,00:05:33.25,00:05:33.25,"The one thing I've always maintained is, whoever won that"
118,00:05:35.25,00:05:35.25,season deserves to win that season.
119,00:05:36.71,00:05:36.71,>> Thank you. >> That's the way it plays out.
120,00:05:38.38,00:05:38.38,That's the hand you have. It's the people that you're
121,00:05:40.21,00:05:40.21,"surrounded with. If you win it, it's your game."
122,00:05:42.88,00:05:42.88,"It's yours. Sorry, Russell."

141,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,I'm not exaggerating when I say this is what it was like every

146,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67,"ironically, Russell, you tipped off something we're going to do."
147,00:07:02.62,00:07:02.62,We are actually going to crown the winner of the dumbest move
148,00:07:06.08,00:07:06.08,"in Survivor history-- and J.T., you're in the running."

191,00:09:30.08,00:09:30.08,>> Who is first? >> PROBST: Colby Donaldson holds
192,00:09:32.33,00:09:32.33,the record for... Seven. Yes.
193,00:09:36.50,00:09:36.50,"Russell, what happened? Did you know what happened with"
194,00:09:39.75,00:09:39.75,the hat at the time when you came back and it was gone?
195,00:09:42.96,00:09:42.96,">> No, I didn't know what happened with the hat."
196,00:09:46.25,00:09:46.25,"I figured somebody did something, but it was..."
197,00:09:50.17,00:09:50.17,"You know, there was three people left."
198,00:09:52.58,00:09:52.58,So what strategic move would that be?
199,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,"So I'm like, ""Where's my hat?"" I don't know where my hat is."
200,00:09:59.17,00:09:59.17,>> PROBST: So is the first time you saw what happened just
201,00:10:01.12,00:10:01.12,watching it tonight? >> Yes.
202,00:10:02.83,00:10:02.83,">> PROBST: Reaction, when Miss Sandra said..."
203,00:10:05.00,00:10:05.00,">> I think, you know what, it was a good move."
204,00:10:07.17,00:10:07.17,">> It stunk, it was dirty, it was funky, so I threw it in the"
205,00:10:09.54,00:10:09.54,fire. >> You know what?
206,00:10:12.33,00:10:12.33,I give credit where credit is due.
207,00:10:15.12,00:10:15.12,">> And I felt bad after I did it, because he said he wore it"
208,00:10:17.62,00:10:17.62,"for two seasons, but then when he started acting crazy, then I"
209,00:10:20.38,00:10:20.38,"was like, I'm glad I did it. >> Really? Two seasons?"
210,00:10:23.71,00:10:23.71,No. I give credit where credit is due.
211,00:10:26.12,00:10:26.12,"And you know what, by burning my hat couldn't fluster me at"
212,00:10:28.83,00:10:28.83,"Tribal Council. But, you know, at the end of the"
213,00:10:33.00,00:10:33.00,"day, Parvati... >> PROBST: Parvati what?"
214,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,>> She probably should have won. (cheers and applause)
215,00:10:39.92,00:10:39.92,">> PROBST: Well, again, Russell, that's a different game."
216,00:10:42.08,00:10:42.08,>> I do give credit where credit is due.
217,00:10:43.50,00:10:43.50,">> PROBST: That's called ""Russell decides who wins"

219,00:10:47.12,00:10:47.12,Burnett. He might really like it.
220,00:10:49.21,00:10:49.21,>> I think he would. >> PROBST: Let me ask you--
221,00:10:51.50,00:10:51.50,"are you aware, though, when you're playing this game, are"
222,00:10:54.46,00:10:54.46,you aware of jury... >> I don't care about that.
223,00:10:57.08,00:10:57.08,I play as hard as I can. You know what?
224,00:10:59.42,00:10:59.42,">> PROBST: Russell, stop! Take a deep breath with me."
225,00:11:02.67,00:11:02.67,"Russell, you and me, right here. Here we go."

227,00:11:08.62,00:11:08.62,">> Breathe. >> PROBST: Yeah, okay, I'm just"
228,00:11:10.42,00:11:10.42,trying to get some information here.
229,00:11:12.00,00:11:12.00,>> Okay. >> PROBST: Are you aware during
230,00:11:13.75,00:11:13.75,"the game, like, when you get into an argument with Rupert"
231,00:11:16.50,00:11:16.50,that's that vicious-- we just saw a clip of it coming in--
232,00:11:19.08,00:11:19.08,you're not going to get his vote?
233,00:11:20.88,00:11:20.88,"When you betray Jerri, you're probably not gonna get her..."
234,00:11:23.33,00:11:23.33,"Are you thinking, do you think, ""Well, that's two votes,"
235,00:11:25.62,00:11:25.62,"but I've got others""? >> You know what?"
236,00:11:27.92,00:11:27.92,"After I played the first time and played right again, is..."
237,00:11:33.67,00:11:33.67,I played one time. And I was whipped.
238,00:11:37.12,00:11:37.12,>> PROBST: That's not the question.
239,00:11:38.50,00:11:38.50,Are you aware of the jury? This is a fundamental...
240,00:11:41.08,00:11:41.08,>> I know. >> PROBST: Let me explain
241,00:11:42.46,00:11:42.46,something before you answer. >> I hear what you're saying.
242,00:11:44.21,00:11:44.21,">> PROBST: Well, you haven't answered what I've asked, so"
243,00:11:46.21,00:11:46.21,I'll ask you again. >> He doesn't understand.
244,00:11:48.12,00:11:48.12,>> PROBST: Do you...? (laughter)
245,00:11:49.21,00:11:49.21,>> He doesn't know what that means.
246,00:11:51.38,00:11:51.38,>> PROBST: Do you think about the fact that the
247,00:11:53.29,00:11:53.29,social game is something you're missing?
248,00:11:55.21,00:11:55.21,>> I don't care about that fact! I play the game as hard
249,00:11:58.33,00:11:58.33,as I can. I do what I have to do.
250,00:12:01.08,00:12:01.08,I do what I can do. And you know what?
251,00:12:03.67,00:12:03.67,"I make it to the end every time. >> PROBST: Boston Rob, Boston"
252,00:12:06.75,00:12:06.75,Rob... >> But you'll never win.
253,00:12:08.50,00:12:08.50,>> Okay! (cheers and applause)
254,00:12:12.71,00:12:12.71,">> PROBST: Boston Rob. Boston Rob, quick..."
255,00:12:18.17,00:12:18.17,"quick question: if you and Russell had teamed up,"
256,00:12:20.42,00:12:20.42,how might that have gone? >> It would have gone
257,00:12:24.21,00:12:24.21,"pretty good. The problem with Russell,"
258,00:12:26.12,00:12:26.12,and I think what he's trying to say to you is that he doesn't
259,00:12:29.08,00:12:29.08,play the game to win. And it's clear in his strategy.
260,00:12:32.08,00:12:32.08,"He plays a good game to get to the end, but he doesn't play a"
261,00:12:35.38,00:12:35.38,game to win the game. And that's where he and I
262,00:12:38.12,00:12:38.12,"differ, among other things as well."
263,00:12:40.50,00:12:40.50,"If we had teamed up, we could have done pretty well together,"
264,00:12:44.17,00:12:44.17,I think. >> And you play the game to win?
265,00:12:46.33,00:12:46.33,>> I do play the game to win. >> He does.
266,00:12:48.33,00:12:48.33,>> When have you won? >> I haven't.
267,00:12:50.25,00:12:50.25,">> Just sayin'. >> But I guarantee you,"
268,00:12:52.00,00:12:52.00,"given the opportunity, I'd gladly go back and kick your"
269,00:12:54.17,00:12:54.17,"ass all over the island. >> Okay, I will love it!"
270,00:12:57.21,00:12:57.21,(loud cheers and applause) >> I ain't shaking your hand.
271,00:13:03.62,00:13:03.62,>> You're not shaking my hand? You know what?
272,00:13:05.83,00:13:05.83,Let's make it happen. >> PROBST: All right.
273,00:13:07.46,00:13:07.46,>> You make it happen. >> PROBST: That could be a
274,00:13:10.12,00:13:10.12,future season:  Rob vs. Russell.
275,00:13:12.88,00:13:12.88,"All right, I want to talk about something else that I found"
276,00:13:16.12,00:13:16.12,"very, uh, I thought was impactful this season, a couple"
277,00:13:19.54,00:13:19.54,"of dumb moves, starting with you, Tyson."
278,00:13:22.29,00:13:22.29,"It's a little hard to set up, but if you watch the"
279,00:13:25.21,00:13:25.21,"season, there came a time at Tribal Council where Boston Rob"
280,00:13:27.54,00:13:27.54,"had laid it out: ""Here's what ""we do, and we get rid of"
281,00:13:30.21,00:13:30.21,"""either Parvati or Russell by the end of the night."""
282,00:13:33.25,00:13:33.25,"Inexplicably, you change your vote in the middle."
283,00:13:36.25,00:13:36.25,"Not only were you voted out, you changed the entire course"
284,00:13:39.50,00:13:39.50,of the game. >> Yeah.
285,00:13:40.88,00:13:40.88,>> PROBST: Do you think about that?
286,00:13:42.46,00:13:42.46,"Does that haunt you? >> All the time, yeah."
287,00:13:44.29,00:13:44.29,"But, you know what? You make, you have to take risky"
288,00:13:46.83,00:13:46.83,moves in the game to-to get far. >> PROBST: Was that was risky
289,00:13:49.62,00:13:49.62,or dumb? >> If it would have worked
290,00:13:51.46,00:13:51.46,"out, I would have looked like a genius, Jeff."
291,00:13:53.33,00:13:53.33,"Like, Parvati knows, she's played the game with, like, 85"
292,00:13:55.75,00:13:55.75,"people in Survivor history, and half of 'em are here, and so,"
293,00:13:58.21,00:13:58.21,"and I knew everybody hated Russell, so to keep him"
294,00:14:00.21,00:14:00.21,around... >> PROBST: So you were
295,00:14:02.17,00:14:02.17,"playing the odds. >> Right, and I knew that"
296,00:14:03.83,00:14:03.83,there was a chance. I knew he had the
297,00:14:06.04,00:14:06.04,"idol, 'cause Coach told me... >> PROBST: All right."
298,00:14:07.83,00:14:07.83,>> ..and I knew that he could give it to Parvati.
299,00:14:10.12,00:14:10.12,>> PROBST: so you-you've got a strategy behind it.
300,00:14:12.12,00:14:12.12,">> Yeah, definitely. >> PROBST: J.T., the other"
301,00:14:13.71,00:14:13.71,dumb move this season. We've already talked about it.
302,00:14:15.67,00:14:15.67,"My only question for you is, I saw that move as a pretty"
303,00:14:18.46,00:14:18.46,decent strategic idea. If you were right and he needed
304,00:14:22.25,00:14:22.25,"you, it could have been a brilliant move."
305,00:14:24.04,00:14:24.04,Do you have any regrets about that?
306,00:14:25.92,00:14:25.92,>> Not at all. I would have never done it if I
307,00:14:28.08,00:14:28.08,"thought I was safe to begin to begin with, you know?"
308,00:14:30.54,00:14:30.54,"I was at a point where I felt like I was going home, you know"
309,00:14:33.88,00:14:33.88,the next couple of votes no matter what.
310,00:14:35.54,00:14:35.54,"The odds were against me, and I was hoping to play with Coach,"
311,00:14:38.33,00:14:38.33,"Rob, Courtney, or, you know, Tyson."
312,00:14:41.79,00:14:41.79,"And one by one, they got picked off."
313,00:14:43.79,00:14:43.79,"So I was like, ""Well, you know, I know I'm not going to be able"
314,00:14:47.25,00:14:47.25,"to play with Parvati... >> PROBST: You, again, you"
315,00:14:49.08,00:14:49.08,played the odds. >> My back was against the wall.
316,00:14:50.75,00:14:50.75,"You know, I reached out to somebody."
317,00:14:52.04,00:14:52.04,"But I did not know he was not playing the game to win,"
318,00:14:54.62,00:14:54.62,you know. Who knows?
319,00:14:55.62,00:14:55.62,>> PROBST: We have been conducting a poll online...
320,00:14:57.46,00:14:57.46,"to see, to see... >> Do we get any money if we"
321,00:15:00.42,00:15:00.42,win this thing? (laughter)

325,00:15:11.54,00:15:11.54,has made the dumbest move over the past 20 seasons of Survivor.
326,00:15:15.38,00:15:15.38,There are five nominees. Tyson is one.
327,00:15:18.29,00:15:18.29,"J.T. is another. James, the guy with two idols"
328,00:15:22.00,00:15:22.00,that got voted out back in in China.
329,00:15:24.46,00:15:24.46,Colby Donaldson is one for... people say you took the wrong
330,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,person back in Australia. You could have won if you had
331,00:15:30.92,00:15:30.92,taken the Chef Keith. And even Erik...
332,00:15:33.08,00:15:33.08,Where is Erik? Erik-- wow-- with a new
333,00:15:36.96,00:15:36.96,"haircut. Oh, my gosh!"
334,00:15:39.17,00:15:39.17,"We don't recognize him anymore, the ice cream scooper."
335,00:15:41.25,00:15:41.25,"All right, here are the dumbest moves."
336,00:15:43.04,00:15:43.04,Take a look at this flashback. >> I'm not going anywhere.
337,00:15:47.08,00:15:47.08,I'm on Survivor with two idols.

345,00:16:07.79,00:16:07.79,Parvati. >> I thought it was an
346,00:16:09.54,00:16:09.54,opportunity to flop my vote to Parvati.

376,00:17:52.08,00:17:52.08,"get injured and leave again, but the surprise for me"
377,00:17:55.50,00:17:55.50,was your attitude. You just didn't seem like you
378,00:17:58.12,00:17:58.12,were having fun from day one. What was going on?
379,00:18:01.42,00:18:01.42,">> I mean, I really was kind of having fun."
380,00:18:04.21,00:18:04.21,"It just kind of didn't seem that way, I mean..."
381,00:18:07.67,00:18:07.67,">> PROBST: To, to nobody. >> I mean, we had..."
382,00:18:09.62,00:18:09.62,y'all just seemed to catch me in my moments of the worst
383,00:18:12.62,00:18:12.62,times ever. I love it.
384,00:18:13.83,00:18:13.83,"I mean, it hurt my mom's feelings."
385,00:18:15.38,00:18:15.38,"I'm sorry, Mama, but I really... >> PROBST: So you're telling me,"
386,00:18:18.12,00:18:18.12,"James, there was nothing going on."
387,00:18:19.75,00:18:19.75,"Because I've seen you play now three times, and I, even from"
388,00:18:23.50,00:18:23.50,"the beginning thought, ""Man, the dude's in a bad mood."""
389,00:18:26.25,00:18:26.25,>> It was just... 'cause I was with a great team.
390,00:18:29.12,00:18:29.12,"I mean, I was with... >> PROBST: Are you disappointed"
391,00:18:31.04,00:18:31.04,in yourself? >> I'm disappointed in my knee.
392,00:18:34.08,00:18:34.08,"I'm getting old, but... >> PROBST: But you like how...?"
393,00:18:36.12,00:18:36.12,"So you're all right with it? >> Yes, sir."
394,00:18:37.92,00:18:37.92,">> Honestly, you were trying to help me."
395,00:18:39.62,00:18:39.62,"Like, the whole thing with Stephenie, like, he was"
396,00:18:41.46,00:18:41.46,trying to... >> PROBST: Here comes Amanda to
397,00:18:43.08,00:18:43.08,"James' rescue once again. >> Yeah, yes, she is."
398,00:18:45.25,00:18:45.25,>> He was! He was trying to help me.
399,00:18:48.42,00:18:48.42,>> PROBST: Rupert? >> Yes?
400,00:18:49.46,00:18:49.46,>> PROBST: Tough start for you. >> Oh...
401,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,>> PROBST: A few minutes into the game you have a broken toe.
402,00:18:54.04,00:18:54.04,>> Right. >> PROBST: How did this compare
403,00:18:55.58,00:18:55.58,"for you in seasons past? >> See, and it wasn't just"
404,00:18:57.88,00:18:57.88,"one toe. It was two bones in one toe,"
405,00:18:59.96,00:18:59.96,and the toe we taped it off to was broken also.
406,00:19:02.54,00:19:02.54,I didn't know that till I got out.
407,00:19:05.00,00:19:05.00,"And you know, it put me in... I thought I was gonna be out"
408,00:19:09.04,00:19:09.04,the first day when they sat me out thinking I was weak
409,00:19:12.17,00:19:12.17,on that first challenge. >> PROBST: What do you make of
410,00:19:14.71,00:19:14.71,the whole good versus evil? What do you take from this?
411,00:19:17.04,00:19:17.04,">> It was tough, you know? The lines are always blurred."
412,00:19:19.62,00:19:19.62,"I tell people all the time, I stole, I lied, I manipulated"
413,00:19:22.83,00:19:22.83,"and I was one of the Heroes, you know?"
414,00:19:25.42,00:19:25.42,"I mean, the game is... the game is what the game is."
415,00:19:28.25,00:19:28.25,"I like going out, though, and being called one of the Heroes."
416,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,"(cheers and applause) >> PROBST: Colby, you were"
417,00:19:35.75,00:19:35.75,brought back because you represent-- you embody the

419,00:19:44.08,00:19:44.08,"This season, a horrible start, minutes into, moments"
420,00:19:48.25,00:19:48.25,into the show. Did you know...
421,00:19:50.04,00:19:50.04,did you have a feeling this is not gonna go well right away?
422,00:19:53.71,00:19:53.71,">> Well, physically I did, yeah, yeah."
423,00:19:56.08,00:19:56.08,"Losing to Coach in the first challenge, physically, I knew"
424,00:19:58.71,00:19:58.71,things were different. They were going to be very
425,00:20:01.00,00:20:01.00,different. (laughter)
426,00:20:02.92,00:20:02.92,(laughter) >> PROBST: He's still behind

429,00:20:11.54,00:20:11.54,"(Colby sighs, blows raspberry) >> PROBST: You know, we're"
430,00:20:14.38,00:20:14.38,"looking at some of it now. But you also, though, you"
431,00:20:17.00,00:20:17.00,didn't seem to be enjoying yourself out there.
432,00:20:19.38,00:20:19.38,">> Yeah, I had more fun watching the season than I did"
433,00:20:22.08,00:20:22.08,playing it. I really did.
434,00:20:23.79,00:20:23.79,>> PROBST: Is that because it's your third time?
435,00:20:25.67,00:20:25.67,">> Well, I-I think there was some adventure lost with this,"
436,00:20:28.12,00:20:28.12,"and that is a big part of it for me, you know?"
437,00:20:30.46,00:20:30.46,"And part of that was, was the inability to really go"
438,00:20:33.00,00:20:33.00,"in the water. Whether it was fish, swim,"
439,00:20:34.71,00:20:34.71,"all that. You know, we were really"
440,00:20:36.04,00:20:36.04,quarantined. We couldn't explore in the
441,00:20:37.88,00:20:37.88,"jungle, and that's a lot of what I enjoyed from the"
442,00:20:40.54,00:20:40.54,"previous seasons, even in Panama, when we weren't winning."
443,00:20:42.71,00:20:42.71,"You know, Lex and Ethan and I would go out and free dive"
444,00:20:45.67,00:20:45.67,every day. There was a lot of fun.
445,00:20:47.67,00:20:47.67,There was a lot of adventure. And I couldn't find that
446,00:20:50.12,00:20:50.12,this time. So you couple that with my poor
447,00:20:52.25,00:20:52.25,"performances in the challenges, and it just wasn't..."
448,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,>> PROBST: A rough season. >> It was a rough season.
449,00:20:56.25,00:20:56.25,">> PROBST: Amanda, you've played this game a lot."
450,00:20:58.08,00:20:58.08,"You know, you're second to Parvati, I think, in days"
451,00:21:00.21,00:21:00.21,"played. Obviously, you've done"
452,00:21:01.71,00:21:01.71,"very well. You were, you were one of only"
453,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,four people to make it to the end twice.
454,00:21:07.21,00:21:07.21,"You, Sandra, Parvati and Russell are the only four"
455,00:21:09.75,00:21:09.75,"people who've done that, and yet there's this one quality"
456,00:21:12.29,00:21:12.29,"that seems to elude you, and it's that killer instinct."
457,00:21:15.12,00:21:15.12,"Does this haunt you in life as well, when you just can't...?"
458,00:21:17.96,00:21:17.96,(all groan) >> Wow!
459,00:21:19.46,00:21:19.46,">> PROBST: No, Amanda, I'm not, I'm not picking on you."
460,00:21:21.75,00:21:21.75,It's what everyone on the street says...
461,00:21:23.33,00:21:23.33,>> You always pick on me. >> PROBST: ...she's such a good
462,00:21:25.71,00:21:25.71,"player, but then you back off. You come to James' rescue."
463,00:21:29.21,00:21:29.21,"You know, you, you... you know what I'm saying."
464,00:21:33.21,00:21:33.21,">> Yeah, I don't... I don't know what that is."
465,00:21:36.17,00:21:36.17,"It just, it happens. Like, when it comes down to the"
466,00:21:38.62,00:21:38.62,"cut time where I have to perform, it just, like,"
467,00:21:40.79,00:21:40.79,doesn't happen. I don't know what it is.
468,00:21:42.71,00:21:42.71,"It's, like, it's just something in me, I feel bad or something,"
469,00:21:45.54,00:21:45.54,you know? I feel bad about voting
470,00:21:47.08,00:21:47.08,people out. It's like the game is really
471,00:21:50.12,00:21:50.12,"emotional for me. >> PROBST: Yeah. Still, today?"
472,00:21:52.12,00:21:52.12,>> Yeah. Not as much.
473,00:21:54.75,00:21:54.75,(laughter) >> PROBST: Stephenie...
474,00:21:56.88,00:21:56.88,">> Hi, Jeff. >> PROBST: ...you, kind of like"
475,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83,"Colby, came in, in terms of women, you know, you represented"
476,00:22:02.17,00:22:02.17,"this ideal of great competitor, physical-- you know, shoulder"
477,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,halfway out of your body on day one.
478,00:22:09.67,00:22:09.67,You never really got up to to speed.
479,00:22:11.75,00:22:11.75,">> Yeah. No, I mean, I was, like, very"
480,00:22:14.62,00:22:14.62,grateful to come back a third time.
481,00:22:16.21,00:22:16.21,And I knew that there was a good chance I was gonna go
482,00:22:19.25,00:22:19.25,"very early in this game. I mean, there's, like, probably"
483,00:22:22.00,00:22:22.00,three of us here that really doesn't hang out with any of
484,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,"these other people. So, um, then the shoulder"
485,00:22:26.83,00:22:26.83,dislocation was extremely unfortunate.
486,00:22:30.79,00:22:30.79,Um... >> PROBST: Did you have fun?
487,00:22:32.67,00:22:32.67,">> I mean, I was there, like, six days."
488,00:22:34.79,00:22:34.79,"I tried to have fun, but I was on the outs before"
489,00:22:38.92,00:22:38.92,"the game even began. But, Jeff, I'll tell this."
490,00:22:41.58,00:22:41.58,It's nothing that a filet mignon pizza can't cure
491,00:22:45.62,00:22:45.62,"at my restaurant, G.G.... (cheers and applause)"
492,00:22:49.17,00:22:49.17,"G.G. Restaurant and Lounge. Jeff, what else do I have?"
493,00:22:52.38,00:22:52.38,Come on! I played for six days.
494,00:22:54.42,00:22:54.42,">> PROBST: Okay, good. Congratulations for you."
495,00:22:57.21,00:22:57.21,I'm glad you have a restaurant going.
496,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: Cirie, is there"
497,00:23:01.54,00:23:01.54,anything you can do in this game when you come into it with
498,00:23:04.25,00:23:04.25,"the kind of target you had on your back, is there... is it"
499,00:23:06.67,00:23:06.67,just that's just the way it went this season?
500,00:23:09.75,00:23:09.75,">> (sighs) Jeff, I don't think there's"
501,00:23:12.04,00:23:12.04,anything I could have done different besides-- I don't
502,00:23:15.62,00:23:15.62,"know, maybe pay Tom a million dollars."
503,00:23:19.17,00:23:19.17,"I mean, I did everything I could."
504,00:23:21.96,00:23:21.96,When people have a perception of who you are and what you
505,00:23:24.96,00:23:24.96,"are, it's hard to break that. And if you're not given the"
506,00:23:28.50,00:23:28.50,"opportunity to break it, then you get what you get."

508,00:23:33.96,00:23:33.96,"this video. Coach, you supplied a moment"
509,00:23:36.29,00:23:36.29,this year with Tyson that was one of the most interesting and
510,00:23:40.08,00:23:40.08,"touching and funny moments. If we have this, I want to"
511,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,"roll it. If not, we'll just talk"
512,00:23:45.62,00:23:45.62,about it. Do we have it?
513,00:23:47.08,00:23:47.08,>> Why doesn't anybody ever say anything good about me?
514,00:23:49.04,00:23:49.04,"Am I that bad of a person, man? >> If you want to stick it out,"
515,00:23:52.21,00:23:52.21,"I'll help you through it. >> Thanks for coming out here,"
516,00:23:55.08,00:23:55.08,"man. >> No problem, dude."
517,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,">> PROBST: Now, now, Coach... (cheers and applause)"
518,00:24:06.46,00:24:06.46,"Coach, just one question... we don't have a lot of time..."
519,00:24:10.29,00:24:10.29,">> Oh, geez, you've got to preface it with that?"
520,00:24:12.33,00:24:12.33,">> PROBST: Well, because you will tell a story."
521,00:24:14.62,00:24:14.62,">> All right, yes. (laughter)"
522,00:24:16.92,00:24:16.92,>> PROBST: I found that a very endearing moment.
523,00:24:19.33,00:24:19.33,"You truly were trying to say, what is it about me?"
524,00:24:21.83,00:24:21.83,>> Right. >> PROBST: Have you learned
525,00:24:23.17,00:24:23.17,anything about how people perceive you on this game?
526,00:24:25.79,00:24:25.79,">> I think, you know, the first time I came into it I came in as"
527,00:24:28.29,00:24:28.29,"Coach, you can never be wrong, you've always got to, you"
528,00:24:30.38,00:24:30.38,"know, keep a stiff upper lip, and I saw myself on television"
529,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,"and I said, ""That guy is an arrogant ass."""
530,00:24:35.17,00:24:35.17,And I got to change about that. And so I learned from the game
531,00:24:38.17,00:24:38.17,and came into the next game-- I wanted redemption so bad.
532,00:24:41.62,00:24:41.62,"And early on, the reason why I broke down is because all these"
533,00:24:44.46,00:24:44.46,"thoughts were, ""Can I change it?"
534,00:24:46.38,00:24:46.38,"Can I change that perception?"" I'm trying my best, and at that"
535,00:24:48.96,00:24:48.96,"point at Tribal, when Sandra said that, I thought maybe"
536,00:24:51.67,00:24:51.67,I can't change it. Tyson gave me a great empowering
537,00:24:54.08,00:24:54.08,speech. Change who you are.
538,00:24:55.42,00:24:55.42,"And I woke up the next day and I just thought, ""You know"

560,00:26:21.17,00:26:21.17,"Russell, already shaking his hand like he knows it's him."
561,00:26:23.75,00:26:23.75,It is Russell. So... America decided between good
562,00:26:30.17,00:26:30.17,"versus evil, and much like the game went, evil has won again."
563,00:26:34.08,00:26:34.08,Russell is the Sprint player of the season...
564,00:26:38.21,00:26:38.21,"(cheering and applause) ...and the winner of $100,000."
565,00:26:45.25,00:26:45.25,And you will say... I'll say it more succinctly
566,00:26:48.25,00:26:48.25,because we're out of time. You will say that's proof to
567,00:26:50.75,00:26:50.75,your point that America... >> America-- they make the
568,00:26:52.50,00:26:52.50,decision. They should.
569,00:26:54.58,00:26:54.58,>> PROBST: Jerri... >> Yes.
570,00:26:57.88,00:26:57.88,"(cheering) I have to say, having watched"
571,00:27:03.04,00:27:03.04,"you play this game three times, it seems like this season it"
572,00:27:05.54,00:27:05.54,all came together. Are you happy with how you
573,00:27:07.75,00:27:07.75,"played physically, competitively, strategically"
574,00:27:09.75,00:27:09.75,"and spiritually? >> Jeff, I am so excited to be"
575,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,"here again for a third time, and I have to say that watching the"
576,00:27:17.25,00:27:17.25,"show, I was really proud of the way I played the game and"
577,00:27:20.17,00:27:20.17,"watching it, I just felt the same way times 1,000."
578,00:27:25.08,00:27:25.08,And I feel like I've kind... the irony of my situation is
579,00:27:29.38,00:27:29.38,"that the first time I played this, people hated me so bad,"
580,00:27:33.54,00:27:33.54,"they wanted me gone. This time, they liked me too"
581,00:27:36.54,00:27:36.54,much to keep me around. >> PROBST: Nicely done.
582,00:27:40.33,00:27:40.33,"Danielle, Danielle, you played a mighty game."
583,00:27:47.08,00:27:47.08,"You were in it... Danielle, you were in it until"
584,00:27:50.08,00:27:50.08,"the end, and then you had this breakdown at Tribal."
585,00:27:52.88,00:27:52.88,You talked about how exhausted you were.
586,00:27:54.83,00:27:54.83,"Did you feel it coming on, or was it in retrospect that you"
587,00:27:57.29,00:27:57.29,"were able to see what happened? >> No, I felt it coming on."
588,00:28:01.25,00:28:01.25,That day was just so stressful for me. I was...
589,00:28:04.25,00:28:04.25,Russell was trying to get me voted off all day.
590,00:28:06.29,00:28:06.29,"And you know, I'm human. I have emotions, I have"
591,00:28:09.21,00:28:09.21,"feeling, I have heart. And it just proved at the end"
592,00:28:11.17,00:28:11.17,of the day that I'm not a villain.
593,00:28:13.08,00:28:13.08,"So what can I say? I mean, I look back on it, and"
594,00:28:16.12,00:28:16.12,"it kills me, 'cause I'm just like..."
595,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17,">> PROBST: You were there. >> Oh, if I just kept it"
596,00:28:19.62,00:28:19.62,"together, I was going to the end."
597,00:28:22.21,00:28:22.21,"But it is what it is. And, you know, I have to move"
598,00:28:24.96,00:28:24.96,"on and, Russell, damn you. >> PROBST: Courtney, one thing"
599,00:28:30.71,00:28:30.71,"about you, Courtney, is you always seemed to be having fun,"
600,00:28:34.00,00:28:34.00,even when it's miserable. Did you have as much fun this
601,00:28:36.75,00:28:36.75,season? (men cheering) Courtney!
602,00:28:40.50,00:28:40.50,">> Um, I had a lot of fun. I came in..."
603,00:28:43.79,00:28:43.79,"I came back, and I had to, like, put myself in the space"
604,00:28:46.88,00:28:46.88,"of, really, are you going to do this now?"
605,00:28:48.62,00:28:48.62,"And I was like, I'm going to go and have the best time that I"
606,00:28:50.67,00:28:50.67,possibly can and enjoy it more than I did the first time.
607,00:28:53.46,00:28:53.46,"And I did. >> PROBST: Randy, on the flip"
608,00:28:55.46,00:28:55.46,side... >> I knew that was coming.
609,00:28:57.54,00:28:57.54,>> PROBST: You rarely seemed to be having any fun.
610,00:28:59.67,00:28:59.67,Did you have any fun at all this time?
611,00:29:03.12,00:29:03.12,">> No, not a bit. (laughter)"
612,00:29:05.92,00:29:05.92,">> PROBST: And Sugar, on the corner, you go to the end, and--"
613,00:29:08.21,00:29:08.21,the first time and then you're first out the second.
614,00:29:11.29,00:29:11.29,>> Both sides of the rainbow. >> PROBST: Yeah.
615,00:29:13.62,00:29:13.62,Is it still an enjoyable experience when you only play
616,00:29:15.96,00:29:15.96,three days? >> I was not having fun because
617,00:29:19.33,00:29:19.33,it rained so much and I just didn't feel like I had a decent
618,00:29:22.83,00:29:22.83,alliance. >> PROBST: One other thing I
619,00:29:26.25,00:29:26.25,"want to point out, another celebration, much like Rob and"
620,00:29:28.58,00:29:28.58,Amber. Candice delayed...
621,00:29:30.96,00:29:30.96,actually postponed your wedding to do this show.
622,00:29:34.12,00:29:34.12,And now you came home-- I'm looking at a ring-- did you
623,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,guys get married? >> We got married.
624,00:29:38.12,00:29:38.12,>> PROBST: Hold that up. Hold that up there.
625,00:29:40.17,00:29:40.17,">> We got married May 1. My husband, John, he's the best."
626,00:29:44.08,00:29:44.08,">> PROBST: All right. Well, for over 20 seasons of"
627,00:29:49.12,00:29:49.12,"Survivor, we've had 306 episodes, and we've seen and"
628,00:29:53.12,00:29:53.12,we've done a lot on this show. Take a look at some of these
629,00:29:55.04,00:29:55.04,stats. Listen to this-- we've visited
630,00:29:56.54,00:29:56.54,15 countries. We've had over 300 people play
631,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,this game. We've had nearly 500 challenges.
632,00:30:02.00,00:30:02.00,"Winners, we've had 11 men, nine women, average age 32."
633,00:30:05.54,00:30:05.54,Twice as many single people win as married.
634,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,And we're almost dead even when it comes to men and women and
635,00:30:12.00,00:30:12.00,how long they last in the game. So we thought it might be fun
636,00:30:14.29,00:30:14.29,to create the Survivor prototype.
637,00:30:17.17,00:30:17.17,"So we combined all of the people who've won Survivor, and came up"
638,00:30:20.96,00:30:20.96,with the ultimate player. And we put all these things
639,00:30:25.25,00:30:25.25,together. We used a little bit from all
640,00:30:27.54,00:30:27.54,"of the winners, and take a look at this, guy."
641,00:30:29.83,00:30:29.83,"That is Richard Hatch's left eyebrow, that's Sandra's right"
642,00:30:32.67,00:30:32.67,"eyebrow. That's the ear lobes of Parvati,"
643,00:30:36.29,00:30:36.29,"the dimples of J.T., the bottom lip of Tom Westman."
644,00:30:39.62,00:30:39.62,We've got Ethan and Amber's in there in the nose.
645,00:30:41.96,00:30:41.96,"Anyway, if you know this guy or if you are this guy, come on to"
646,00:30:45.75,00:30:45.75,"Survivor, because you could win."
647,00:30:47.46,00:30:47.46,"When we come back, find out where Survivor is headed next."
648,00:30:50.83,00:30:50.83,"And first, we want to pay tribute to a dear friend and a"
649,00:30:54.33,00:30:54.33,former Survivor who passed away this year after a long struggle
650,00:30:58.21,00:30:58.21,with cancer. Jenn Lyon will be missed.
651,00:31:16.62,00:31:16.62,"(cheering and applause) >> PROBST: 20 seasons, and"
652,00:31:18.71,00:31:18.71,we're still going strong. Our 21st season begins shooting
653,00:31:21.92,00:31:21.92,soon. Take a look at where Survivor
654,00:31:23.79,00:31:23.79,"is headed next. For the past decade, Survivor"
655,00:31:28.42,00:31:28.42,"has taken you to the furthest corners of the planet, and"
656,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,subjected over 300 contestants to the harshest environments
657,00:31:37.33,00:31:37.33,under the most exhausting conditions.
658,00:31:43.62,00:31:43.62,Join us now as we enter a new decade of Survivor.
659,00:31:49.75,00:31:49.75,This is Nicaragua. It is a land of impenetrable
660,00:31:55.62,00:31:55.62,"terrain, smoldering volcanoes, and savage wildlife."
661,00:32:03.12,00:32:03.12,Christopher Columbus discovered its shores over 500 years ago.
662,00:32:08.17,00:32:08.17,"And for centuries, Spanish conquistadors set out to tame"
663,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,"this exotic land, only to be stopped at every turn by the"
664,00:32:16.46,00:32:16.46,expansive rainforest of this Central American landmark.
665,00:32:21.17,00:32:21.17,"A brand-new set of survivors, exciting and innovative"
666,00:32:26.79,00:32:26.79,challenges and something that may surprise them all.
667,00:32:31.79,00:32:31.79,"Who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast"
668,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,all the others? Find out this Fall as the
