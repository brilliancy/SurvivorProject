6,00:00:13.71,00:00:13.71,And some of the Kota players have not been gracious winners.
7,00:00:16.50,00:00:16.50,>> Mmm! (sniffles)

15,00:00:37.08,00:00:37.08,whole thing. So I feel like you guys should
16,00:00:38.83,00:00:38.83,"take a look, too. >> There is my chance to find"
17,00:00:40.58,00:00:40.58,"the hidden immunity idol for myself, and Charlie blew it for"
18,00:00:43.21,00:00:43.21,me. >> PROBST: The idol was lost
19,00:00:44.88,00:00:44.88,when Marcus convinced everyone to toss it away.
20,00:00:47.79,00:00:47.79,>> These people are so stupid. I got ten people to throw an
21,00:00:51.33,00:00:51.33,immunity idol into the ocean. >> PROBST: At the end of the

26,00:01:04.42,00:01:04.42,"were outnumbered, but not outplayed."
27,00:01:08.92,00:01:08.92,>> Really? >> Yes.
28,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50,">> PROBST: Cleverly, they convinced Susie to help them"
29,00:01:12.83,00:01:12.83,take out Marcus. The tribe has spoken.
30,00:01:14.88,00:01:14.88,"In one swift move, Kenny and Crystal had knocked out one of"
31,00:01:18.17,00:01:18.17,their biggest rivals. Just when you think you're in
32,00:01:20.29,00:01:20.29,"control of this game, blindside. And after enduring 24 days of"
33,00:01:24.75,00:01:24.75,"grief, life is looking pretty good for the underdogs."
34,00:01:28.67,00:01:28.67,Only nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
35,00:01:51.75,00:01:51.75,">> Ah, Kenny, you impressed me. All that talking you did."
36,00:01:58.67,00:01:58.67,"I'm proud of you, though, that you're coming out of your"
37,00:02:01.25,00:02:01.25,shell like that. That's great.
38,00:02:02.83,00:02:02.83,>> Tonight was a huge night for me because it could have been
39,00:02:06.12,00:02:06.12,"me tonight, and thank God it wasn't."
40,00:02:09.25,00:02:09.25,I learned from Crystal at the last seven Tribals.
41,00:02:12.08,00:02:12.08,(laughter) I've been under the radar at
42,00:02:15.29,00:02:15.29,"Fang in the beginning, and now I have to stand up for myself."
43,00:02:18.96,00:02:18.96,"And so far, the last two Tribal Councils I've been to, they've"
44,00:02:22.50,00:02:22.50,been blindsides because-because of me.
45,00:02:26.21,00:02:26.21,">> Well, I bet Marcus didn't see that coming."
46,00:02:28.96,00:02:28.96,>> No. >> The next one to go is Bob.
47,00:02:32.54,00:02:32.54,So Bob should be worried right now.
48,00:02:40.33,00:02:40.33,">> If I'm to last, I'm assuming I need to be in a merge."
49,00:02:44.71,00:02:44.71,"If we're not in a merge, I think I'm history."
50,00:02:48.25,00:02:48.25,Even though my-- I teach science.

55,00:04:10.83,00:04:10.83,">> Good thing we're out of rice, nothing to cook."
56,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67,">> We're out here, 25th day, and we can't even produce fire,"
57,00:04:17.12,00:04:17.12,not even any rice to cook. And I'm hoping for a merge
58,00:04:20.04,00:04:20.04,"any day. The longer I stay on this tribe,"
59,00:04:22.29,00:04:22.29,the closer I go to going home. (elephant trumpeting)
60,00:04:26.54,00:04:26.54,">> Oh, God. >> Ooh, he's got a flag or"
61,00:04:30.12,00:04:30.12,something. Could it be the new tribe flag?
62,00:04:32.12,00:04:32.12,">> Oh, God, I can't take it anymore."
63,00:04:33.58,00:04:33.58,Open the bag. Put it down.
64,00:04:35.12,00:04:35.12,>> There's a note up here. >> Charlie's gonna read it.
65,00:04:37.17,00:04:37.17,">> Golf, it's golf. >> Oh, you're right."
66,00:04:40.67,00:04:40.67,>> It's a golf flag. >> It is a golf flag.
67,00:04:44.46,00:04:44.46,"Oh, my heart is palpitating. >> ""It will be fun, long drives"
68,00:04:49.25,00:04:49.25,and short putts. You may need more practice than
69,00:04:51.92,00:04:51.92,anyone thinks. A once-in-a-lifetime cultural

71,00:04:58.62,00:04:58.62,>> There's a slingshot. >> So we got tree mail this
72,00:05:01.04,00:05:01.04,"morning, but I was really hoping that it was going to be"
73,00:05:03.12,00:05:03.12,"merge, something merge-esque, 'cause I want to see Marcus"
74,00:05:06.17,00:05:06.17,"again. Randy, I can't hold it up"
75,00:05:08.12,00:05:08.12,much longer. >> That's not bad.
76,00:05:12.50,00:05:12.50,>> That's great. (Corinne groans)
77,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,">> The Kota alliance from the get-go is me, Charlie and"
78,00:05:15.62,00:05:15.62,"Marcus. As long as that's intact, I"
79,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,"don't really care who goes home. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
80,00:05:34.42,00:05:34.42,Fang getting your first look at the new Kota.
81,00:05:37.12,00:05:37.12,Marcus voted out at the last Tribal Council.
82,00:05:49.25,00:05:49.25,Huge reactions from the Fang tribe.
83,00:05:52.08,00:05:52.08,"Corinne, you look miserable. >> I'm pissed, yeah."
84,00:05:56.62,00:05:56.62,He didn't deserve to leave the game.
85,00:05:58.21,00:05:58.21,>> Then who does? Who does deserve to leave the
86,00:06:00.25,00:06:00.25,game? >> It's a game.
87,00:06:01.46,00:06:01.46,We all deserve it. It's a game.
88,00:06:03.54,00:06:03.54,">> I know it's a game, but I'm sad."
89,00:06:05.67,00:06:05.67,I think a lot of people out here complain a lot.
90,00:06:08.38,00:06:08.38,Marcus never did that. He was enjoying every second
91,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,"out here. >> I don't understand, I don't"
92,00:06:13.25,00:06:13.25,understand why he doesn't deserve to leave the game.
93,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,>> It's not that anyone deserves it.
94,00:06:16.58,00:06:16.58,"It's just that I think that, uh, he earned his right to be here"
95,00:06:19.33,00:06:19.33,"longer, I guess. >> PROBST: All right, you guys"
96,00:06:23.12,00:06:23.12,ready to get to today's reward challenge?
97,00:06:25.04,00:06:25.04,">> Yes. >> Yes, we are."
98,00:06:26.25,00:06:26.25,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, you're going to do a"
99,00:06:27.75,00:06:27.75,"little golfing, Survivor style.  Using a large slingshot, you"
100,00:06:33.00,00:06:33.00,will aim and shoot your ball toward the hole...
101,00:06:37.50,00:06:37.50,until finally you land your ball in the hole.
102,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,The tribe with the lowest number of shots wins the hole.
103,00:06:44.21,00:06:44.21,The best two out of three wins reward.
104,00:06:46.75,00:06:46.75,Want to know what you're playing for?
105,00:06:48.21,00:06:48.21,>> Yes. >> PROBST: You will be taken to
106,00:06:50.42,00:06:50.42,"a Gabonese village, where you will enjoy a beautiful dance"
107,00:06:54.08,00:06:54.08,"ceremony, have a nice meal... >> Wow."
108,00:06:57.12,00:06:57.12,>> PROBST: ...and spend the night.
109,00:06:58.25,00:06:58.25,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: You'll return to camp"
110,00:07:00.08,00:07:00.08,"in the morning. In addition, the winning tribe"
111,00:07:02.29,00:07:02.29,will send one person from the losing tribe to Exile Island.
112,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00,"Fang, you have one extra member-- sitting somebody out."
113,00:07:08.21,00:07:08.21,Who you going to sit out this time?
114,00:07:10.00,00:07:10.00,>> Is that cool? Okay.
115,00:07:12.21,00:07:12.21,">> PROBST: All right, Corinne, you'll be on the bench."
116,00:07:13.71,00:07:13.71,"Everybody else, we'll get you started."
117,00:07:20.83,00:07:20.83,"Kota has the first shot. 300 yards to the hole, slight"
118,00:07:25.25,00:07:25.25,"downhill grade. >> One, two, three."
119,00:07:30.67,00:07:30.67,>> PROBST: Bob launches back. Just over my head.
120,00:07:35.17,00:07:35.17,Nice shot. Just shy of 150 yards.
121,00:07:39.21,00:07:39.21,Fang is up. Matty launches.
122,00:07:43.08,00:07:43.08,">> Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
123,00:07:46.21,00:07:46.21,>> PROBST: Another nice shot. Head over.
124,00:07:51.25,00:07:51.25,Both drives pretty even. Fang outdrove Kota by just a
125,00:07:55.88,00:07:55.88,"bit, so Kota will shoot first. >> Ready?"
126,00:07:58.58,00:07:58.58,"One, two, three, go. >> PROBST: Bob launches"
127,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,straight at the hole. And a great kick.
128,00:08:07.75,00:08:07.75,">> Oh, slow down. >> It's all right-- perfect."
129,00:08:09.96,00:08:09.96,>> PROBST: Nice shot by Kota. >> Yes.
130,00:08:13.08,00:08:13.08,>> PROBST: Matty back with the second shot for Fang.
131,00:08:16.21,00:08:16.21,>> No. >> PROBST: And his shot goes
132,00:08:18.04,00:08:18.04,way left. But it gets a pretty good
133,00:08:21.96,00:08:21.96,bounce. Ends up about 20 yards from the
134,00:08:24.12,00:08:24.12,hole. We are tied.
135,00:08:27.79,00:08:27.79,Two shots each. Fang with their third shot.
136,00:08:33.29,00:08:33.29,"Randy, way short. Third shot for Kota."
137,00:08:40.12,00:08:40.12,Kenny's going to be the shooter this time.
138,00:08:42.17,00:08:42.17,Could win the hole right here. And he does it.
139,00:08:45.25,00:08:45.25,Kota scores the first point! Moving on to the next hole.
140,00:08:50.33,00:08:50.33,"Second hole. 225 yards, uphill."
141,00:08:55.17,00:08:55.17,">> One, two, three. >> PROBST: Nice shot."
142,00:09:02.04,00:09:02.04,Just past the 125-yard marker. >> Good job.
143,00:09:05.96,00:09:05.96,>> PROBST: Matty back shooting now for Fang.
144,00:09:13.92,00:09:13.92,Nice shot from Fang. Both balls very close.
145,00:09:17.50,00:09:17.50,"Come on down. Fang, you're furthest out."
146,00:09:21.96,00:09:21.96,You'll shoot first. He lets it go.
147,00:09:28.08,00:09:28.08,"Hits high on the mountain, falls all the way down, just"
148,00:09:32.71,00:09:32.71,six inches from the hole. >> Whoo!
149,00:09:35.04,00:09:35.04,">> Nice, nice. >> PROBST: Kota with their"
150,00:09:36.67,00:09:36.67,second shot; got to get close. Bob with a decent shot but
151,00:09:41.25,00:09:41.25,still about 30 feet away from the hole.
152,00:09:43.04,00:09:43.04,>> That's all right. We'll get it in.
153,00:09:44.38,00:09:44.38,We'll get it in. >> PROBST: Kota with their
154,00:09:46.50,00:09:46.50,third shot. Probably need to get this one
155,00:09:49.38,00:09:49.38,"in the hole. Kenny gives it a good shot, but"
156,00:09:54.12,00:09:54.12,it's too long. >> It's all right.
157,00:09:55.79,00:09:55.79,"It's all right, Kenny. >> PROBST: Fang now with their"
158,00:09:57.54,00:09:57.54,third shot. Fang needs this to stay alive.
159,00:10:02.08,00:10:02.08,">> Like that? Go widen out, Charlie, widen"
160,00:10:03.92,00:10:03.92,out. >> Just not too much power.
161,00:10:05.04,00:10:05.04,>> Widen out. >> That's it.
162,00:10:10.29,00:10:10.29,">> PROBST: And he does it. Fang ties it up, 1-1."
163,00:10:16.46,00:10:16.46,This is it. Final hole.
164,00:10:18.58,00:10:18.58,"200 yards, uphill. We are tied, one each."
165,00:10:24.33,00:10:24.33,Playing to two. Matty launches one.
166,00:10:30.12,00:10:30.12,Gets a nice kick. Dead center perfect.
167,00:10:34.58,00:10:34.58,Kota's up. Bob launches.
168,00:10:39.42,00:10:39.42,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: A huge drive.
169,00:10:42.12,00:10:42.12,Nice off the tee box for Kota. Kota!
170,00:10:44.46,00:10:44.46,">> It's not about deuces. >> PROBST: Matty, back."
171,00:10:50.33,00:10:50.33,Launches a nice one. >> It's all right.
172,00:10:54.50,00:10:54.50,"It's all right. Come on, roll."
173,00:10:55.75,00:10:55.75,">> PROBST: Look at that, kicking all the way back."
174,00:10:58.67,00:10:58.67,"Decent shot by Fang, in good shape."
175,00:11:01.33,00:11:01.33,"Kota, you're up. >> One, two, three."
176,00:11:03.79,00:11:03.79,">> PROBST: Bob launches. Far to the right, but he's"
177,00:11:07.54,00:11:07.54,getting a good kick. >> Yes!
178,00:11:09.25,00:11:09.25,>> PROBST: Kota in pretty decent shape.
179,00:11:13.75,00:11:13.75,Kota now up with their third shot.
180,00:11:16.88,00:11:16.88,Winner of this hole wins reward. Kenny just misses.
181,00:11:26.42,00:11:26.42,"Six inches too far, rolls down the hill, opens the door for"
182,00:11:31.21,00:11:31.21,"Fang. He had to go short, and puts it"
183,00:11:36.71,00:11:36.71,"right on the edge of the hole. >> Oh, my God."
184,00:11:39.17,00:11:39.17,>> PROBST: Big-time pressure on Kota for this shot.
185,00:11:42.38,00:11:42.38,"Kota, with their fourth shot, knowing that Fang is literally"
186,00:11:47.71,00:11:47.71,on the edge of the hole. Kenny just overshoots it.
187,00:11:57.83,00:11:57.83,Matty can win it for Fang right here.
188,00:11:59.83,00:11:59.83,">> Could. >> Charlie, hold it out here."
189,00:12:02.08,00:12:02.08,">> Okay. >> No rush, no rush."

198,00:12:24.25,00:12:24.25,Stop. We got to...
199,00:12:25.25,00:12:25.25,">> Can I do it? >> No, I got it."

212,00:12:53.29,00:12:53.29,Fang with the win for reward. This should be a fun afternoon.
213,00:12:58.25,00:12:58.25,>> We're hungry and tense. >> Yes!
214,00:13:02.62,00:13:02.62,">> Corinne, we won! >> Good job."

226,00:13:37.46,00:13:37.46,Here's a map. Have fun.
227,00:13:40.17,00:13:40.17,>> Which way do I want to go? >> PROBST: Straight up there.
228,00:13:42.58,00:13:42.58,Bob will return in time for the next immunity challenge.
229,00:13:47.08,00:13:47.08,>> Bob's never going to find that idol because nobody has
230,00:13:49.71,00:13:49.71,"that idol but me, and no matter who gets sent to Exile, the"

234,00:14:02.25,00:14:02.25,Grab your stuff. Head out.
235,00:14:04.62,00:14:04.62,>> That was the most anxiety-ridden challenge I've
236,00:14:07.21,00:14:07.21,had in this whole competition. I felt like I was going to
237,00:14:09.92,00:14:09.92,"have, like, four heart attacks. >> Matty, I don't know what got"
238,00:14:13.58,00:14:13.58,"into the guy, but what he pulled was ugly."
239,00:14:15.92,00:14:15.92,He would not even listen. It was like  The Outer Limits.

251,00:15:40.17,00:15:40.17,It was really nice. And then we went to the next
252,00:15:47.29,00:15:47.29,"tribal ceremony and this little girl-- she was very, very cute."
253,00:15:49.62,00:15:49.62,"She was, like, too small to, like, follow everybody, and,"
254,00:15:51.92,00:15:51.92,"like, hang out so I paid some attention to her and then she"
255,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,"was, like, glued to me. Which was cute, um, but I'd be"

258,00:16:08.54,00:16:08.54,Marcus gone. >> I was shocked.
259,00:16:10.08,00:16:10.08,>> 'Cause you were just thinking about the reward.
260,00:16:11.92,00:16:11.92,">> Well, yeah, we probably would have lost if Marcus was there,"
261,00:16:13.71,00:16:13.71,probably. >> It's crazy how that happened.

265,00:16:27.29,00:16:27.29,"had in this game, because Marcus and I had been playing together"

267,00:16:33.88,00:16:33.88,"this game, but as, like, really good friends."
268,00:16:36.04,00:16:36.04,"And now with him gone it's like ugh, who do we turn to, because"
269,00:16:39.21,00:16:39.21,he did a lot of thinking for us. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

273,00:17:02.46,00:17:02.46,kind of liked me. I hate to dance.
274,00:17:05.04,00:17:05.04,My feet hurt. My knee hurts.
275,00:17:07.17,00:17:07.17,My shoulder hurts. And just ate about four pounds
276,00:17:09.21,00:17:09.21,"of food, but, hell, I danced with her."

280,00:17:24.21,00:17:24.21,dance. It was so cool.
281,00:17:29.08,00:17:29.08,"I think that I will be voted out next, so I'm really nervous."
282,00:17:33.08,00:17:33.08,But my main objective was to allow myself a break from the
283,00:17:37.04,00:17:37.04,"game of  Survivor,  and, uh, it gave me some relief that I"
284,00:17:41.50,00:17:41.50,needed desperately. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

288,00:18:27.92,00:18:27.92,It's like one of the worst feelings ever.
289,00:18:30.08,00:18:30.08,"Wait, I know what to do. (grunts)"
290,00:18:33.71,00:18:33.71,I'm not an outdoors type of guy. At home I usually sit in the
291,00:18:37.04,00:18:37.04,room playing video games most of the time.

293,00:18:45.17,00:18:45.17,"I... I'm getting to know how to play this game more,"
294,00:18:48.17,00:18:48.17,this game of  Survivor. Three fishes.

296,00:18:58.54,00:18:58.54,Fried fish. >> Awesome!
297,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,">> That is so cool, Kenny boy! >> Bob's at Exile Island, so,"
298,00:19:05.75,00:19:05.75,"therefore, I'm the only man at Kota with two very beautiful"

301,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,little guy in this game would be the provider for them.
302,00:19:18.38,00:19:18.38,>> This is good! >> The best fish I've had out
303,00:19:21.21,00:19:21.21,here. To me that's a Gabon feast for
304,00:19:23.50,00:19:23.50,me. I am very proud of myself for
305,00:19:26.12,00:19:26.12,"what I've done so far in this game, and if people want to"
306,00:19:29.71,00:19:29.71,"take me out, I will take them out before they take me out,"
307,00:19:32.29,00:19:32.29,"any way I can. So, right now, I know for a fact"

327,00:21:16.04,00:21:16.04,My plan is to make something that looks like an idol.

391,00:25:26.96,00:25:26.96,This is fundamental to being able to survive on your own.

393,00:25:35.21,00:25:35.21,Randy trying to get a spark. Bob really trying to get

411,00:26:58.12,00:26:58.12,"impressive fire. If somebody doesn't hurry up,"
412,00:27:00.96,00:27:00.96,Sugar and Susie are going to be tough to beat.

427,00:27:54.21,00:27:54.21,You will now return to one camp together.
428,00:27:57.83,00:27:57.83,You will be going back to what was formally Fang.
429,00:28:00.67,00:28:00.67,It is now a new camp. You will have everything you
430,00:28:04.04,00:28:04.04,"need there to give yourself a new tribe name, build a new"
431,00:28:06.33,00:28:06.33,"tribe flag. Any personal items, any reward"
432,00:28:09.25,00:28:09.25,items left back at the old Kota camp will be waiting there for
433,00:28:12.62,00:28:12.62,you. Grab your stuff.
434,00:28:14.46,00:28:14.46,Head back to camp. See you at Tribal.
435,00:28:16.12,00:28:16.12,"Congratulations. >> Thanks, Jeff."
436,00:28:19.17,00:28:19.17,">> Finally, we merged, just everybody together, nine of us."
437,00:28:23.25,00:28:23.25,But I hated Fang from the beginning.
438,00:28:25.75,00:28:25.75,There's no way I'm going back to camp tonight with Crystal.
439,00:28:28.38,00:28:28.38,She'll be gone or I'll be gone. (trumpeting)
440,00:28:42.08,00:28:42.08,>> Good to be here. >> Welcome back.
441,00:28:44.75,00:28:44.75,"Congratulations, everyone. I can't believe we've got"
442,00:28:48.38,00:28:48.38,canned food here. That must be our beans.
443,00:28:50.17,00:28:50.17,">> I think it's rice. >> Oh, good!"
444,00:28:53.04,00:28:53.04,">> Beans or beanie weenie. >> Yeah, let's eat it."
445,00:28:56.58,00:28:56.58,>> The merge totally changed the game.
446,00:28:58.46,00:28:58.46,"We got back, everybody paid homage to all our new gifts."
447,00:29:01.04,00:29:01.04,There was rice; there was canned food; there was beans.
448,00:29:04.50,00:29:04.50,There was Gabon pears. There's coffee.
449,00:29:07.33,00:29:07.33,"But, uh, as soon as that little brief gratitude session was"
450,00:29:11.17,00:29:11.17,up... >> Want to go to the woods?
451,00:29:14.17,00:29:14.17,>> ...people bounced into the jungle and started their
452,00:29:17.33,00:29:17.33,"strategies, you know. (exhales sharply)"
453,00:29:24.12,00:29:24.12,">> Crystal's the way to go, and I'm voting for Crystal."
454,00:29:27.04,00:29:27.04,Don't worry. Bob will vote Crystal.
455,00:29:29.17,00:29:29.17,">> Yeah, the four of us are on board for Crystal, so we just"
456,00:29:31.62,00:29:31.62,need Sugar. I feel very confident that
457,00:29:33.75,00:29:33.75,"Corinne, Bob, Randy, and I are a solid four, and I feel"
458,00:29:38.08,00:29:38.08,"confident that Matty, Kenny, Susie, and Crystal are a solid"
459,00:29:43.17,00:29:43.17,"four. Then, there's Sugar."
460,00:29:46.08,00:29:46.08,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah. \xe2\x99\xaa >> And she is hanging somewhere
461,00:29:49.25,00:29:49.25,"in the middle, and she has ties to both sides."
462,00:29:51.54,00:29:51.54,But Sugar has a mind of her own and is playing this game
463,00:29:54.38,00:29:54.38,very differently than all of us. (squeals)
464,00:30:15.71,00:30:15.71,">> Are we on board? >> Yeah, I'm..."
465,00:30:18.50,00:30:18.50,"I can't live with him anymore, and he's going to cause big"
466,00:30:21.38,00:30:21.38,problems. >> We can do Randy next.
467,00:30:24.42,00:30:24.42,">> That's what I was saying. I mean, I want you to be"
468,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,"comfortable, so I care about your opinion."
469,00:30:32.25,00:30:32.25,My whole plan is just to stay on Sugar because she... she is
470,00:30:35.12,00:30:35.12,the swing vote. Not only do I have to act
471,00:30:37.29,00:30:37.29,"interested in what Sugar is saying, but I have to act like I"
472,00:30:39.67,00:30:39.67,"care about her. >> Honestly, will you trust me?"
473,00:30:44.96,00:30:44.96,"Like, it's the best move. >> I just know Randy is in a bad"
474,00:30:47.33,00:30:47.33,"spot and he has to stick with us, and I just want to stay in"
475,00:30:50.21,00:30:50.21,the game. >> It's the Kota foursome to
476,00:30:52.21,00:30:52.21,the end. >> Sugar is so weak and naive
477,00:30:56.08,00:30:56.08,and gullible. I have been nasty to her for 25
478,00:30:58.42,00:30:58.42,"days. I was nice to her one day, and"
479,00:31:01.50,00:31:01.50,"she's sold. So it doesn't even make sense,"
480,00:31:04.00,00:31:04.00,but she buys it because she's such a moron.
481,00:31:06.29,00:31:06.29,"(trumpets) >> Now, listen, listen, Charlie"
482,00:31:09.50,00:31:09.50,"and Corinne are the alliance. >> They never, ever, ever break."
483,00:31:13.96,00:31:13.96,">> So we need to break them. >> No, I'm going to tell you"
484,00:31:15.54,00:31:15.54,"right now. Me and... we home, we home."
485,00:31:17.33,00:31:17.33,This is some real... this is the realness over here.
486,00:31:19.42,00:31:19.42,">> Randy is with Kota, too. >> Okay, if he's Kota, then"
487,00:31:21.58,00:31:21.58,you're on their chopping list. >> Why?
488,00:31:23.33,00:31:23.33,">> 'Cause Randy. >> Yeah, yeah."
489,00:31:25.29,00:31:25.29,">> No, but listen... >> But they... them two got's to"
490,00:31:28.17,00:31:28.17,be broken up. >> Which one?
491,00:31:29.54,00:31:29.54,">> Corinne and Charlie. >> Oh, they both need to go."
492,00:31:31.50,00:31:31.50,"Corinne can go first. >> See, Corinne is just hurting"
493,00:31:34.21,00:31:34.21,herself with her own personality.
494,00:31:35.54,00:31:35.54,">> Oh, God, she's horrendous! I can't handle her."
495,00:31:37.58,00:31:37.58,"She is awful, dude. >> (laughing): I know."
496,00:31:39.62,00:31:39.62,">> No, really. >> Yeah, what about...?"
497,00:31:45.08,00:31:45.08,>> I have a personal grudge against Charlie.
498,00:31:46.46,00:31:46.46,"At that feast, freaking Charlie took that paper and he made me"
499,00:31:49.17,00:31:49.17,share it with everybody. I could have gotten the hidden
500,00:31:51.38,00:31:51.38,"immunity idol, and nobody would have known, but no."
501,00:31:53.54,00:31:53.54,"So I made up this little lie. I said, ""Charlie, he's behind"
502,00:31:56.17,00:31:56.17,"the scenes of Kota. He's telling people what to do."""
503,00:31:58.29,00:31:58.29,"But really, no, I made it up, and everybody listened to me."
504,00:32:01.12,00:32:01.12,">> Write down Charlie. Write down Charlie, Charlie."
505,00:32:02.96,00:32:02.96,">> Charlie. >> Charlie, Charlie, Charlie."
506,00:32:04.58,00:32:04.58,>> I'll trade that idol for his life.
507,00:32:06.50,00:32:06.50,Serves him right. We got to blindside Charlie
508,00:32:08.04,00:32:08.04,first. I'm like a little rat.
509,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,"I go... you know, in the corner, and nobody knows that."
510,00:32:13.25,00:32:13.25,"You mess with me, then you're gone in this game."
511,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,Charlie is the brains behind the whole Kota cabana.
512,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,">> Really, it's not...? >> It's not Randy and not"
513,00:32:28.00,00:32:28.00,Corinne. We will get rid of them as soon
514,00:32:31.04,00:32:31.04,"as we can, but Charlie tells them what to do and he's the"
515,00:32:34.04,00:32:34.04,"brains behind it. Yes, but he seems nice, but he"
516,00:32:38.17,00:32:38.17,"goes out and talks and whispers to them, and then they... they"
517,00:32:40.96,00:32:40.96,be themselves. >> Okay.
518,00:32:42.79,00:32:42.79,">> So once we get rid of Charlie, we can get rid of"
519,00:32:44.92,00:32:44.92,"Randy, Corinne, whoever you want."
520,00:32:46.50,00:32:46.50,>> I think I'm the lady of the hour because everybody is
521,00:32:50.88,00:32:50.88,"telling me who to vote for and chomping at the bit to, like,"
522,00:32:53.46,00:32:53.46,"get my vote for somebody. Just ""You got to vote with us."
523,00:32:57.04,00:32:57.04,"Get the numbers, blah, blah, blah."""
524,00:32:59.46,00:32:59.46,So we have to come up with a tribe name?
525,00:33:05.04,00:33:05.04,>> N-O-B-A-G. >> I like that.
526,00:33:07.33,00:33:07.33,"Gabon backwards. >> The thing is, I don't trust"
527,00:33:12.12,00:33:12.12,Kenny. He lied to me about Ace.
528,00:33:14.50,00:33:14.50,So he could be some evil mastermind.
529,00:33:17.25,00:33:17.25,And I don't trust Crystal at all.
530,00:33:19.92,00:33:19.92,I certainly don't have any allegiance to Randy and Corinne.
531,00:33:23.67,00:33:23.67,So I guess I don't trust any of these guys.
532,00:33:27.96,00:33:27.96,>> Are we good? >> Sure.
533,00:33:29.96,00:33:29.96,">> Wait-- yeah, yeah, wherever. >> I think that's good."
534,00:33:33.25,00:33:33.25,">> Even though we're one tribe, there is definitely two sides to"
535,00:33:36.42,00:33:36.42,"this tribe, and both sides of this blue tribe want my vote for"
536,00:33:41.58,00:33:41.58,"another person, so I have no clue what to do, but I don't owe"
537,00:33:46.42,00:33:46.42,anything to anybody at all. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

540,00:34:20.25,00:34:20.25,"So I'll remind you guys, from this point forward, no talking"
541,00:34:23.79,00:34:23.79,to the jury. They're here to observe.
542,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,That's it. The game is slowly shifting into
543,00:34:29.62,00:34:29.62,"their hands. All right, let's start at the"
544,00:34:33.58,00:34:33.58,"reward challenge. Randy, you guys are right on the"
545,00:34:36.42,00:34:36.42,"verge of winning this challenge. All you have to do, literally,"
546,00:34:39.17,00:34:39.17,is just pick up the ball and drop it in.
547,00:34:41.42,00:34:41.42,Where was all that tension coming from when you're on the
548,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,"verge of a win? >> Uh, the shot that Matty took,"
549,00:34:48.04,00:34:48.04,he would make nine times out of ten.
550,00:34:50.88,00:34:50.88,If everybody would have shut up and listened to what I was
551,00:34:54.33,00:34:54.33,"saying, I had a shot that would have made it ten times out of"
552,00:34:57.04,00:34:57.04,"ten. Nobody would listen, and it was"
553,00:34:59.33,00:34:59.33,"frustrating. >> PROBST: Charlie, you were"
554,00:35:01.42,00:35:01.42,seeing that the tribe was starting to break down and maybe
555,00:35:04.21,00:35:04.21,on the verge of blowing an easy win.
556,00:35:06.50,00:35:06.50,">> Yeah, I was screaming over both of them, ""Calm down. Calm"
557,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,"down. Let's communicate"" because to express your point of view,"
558,00:35:12.25,00:35:12.25,"you need to communicate it, and I think the communication really"
559,00:35:14.67,00:35:14.67,"broke down, so I hope we learned from it."

561,00:35:21.54,00:35:21.54,"to Kota, and from that point forward what I've seen has been,"
562,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,"""Don't miss 'em. Didn't like 'em anyway."""
563,00:35:26.79,00:35:26.79,">> Well, since we're putting stuff out on the table, why, why"
564,00:35:29.75,00:35:29.75,have you got issues with me? >> Why?
565,00:35:32.08,00:35:32.08,>> Why do you have issues with Crystal?
566,00:35:34.38,00:35:34.38,"Yes, I would like to know. If I have a problem with"
567,00:35:37.08,00:35:37.08,"anybody, it's clear. It's not any gray area."
568,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,"This is where Crystal stands. >> Okay, w-why...?"
569,00:35:42.29,00:35:42.29,">> W-W-Wait, I let you finish. Let me finish."
570,00:35:44.12,00:35:44.12,>> I never even started. How can you let me finish?
571,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,>> You're opening up your mouth. Let me finish.
572,00:35:48.62,00:35:48.62,"Now, what is it that I did to Randy for Randy to be bashing"
573,00:35:51.92,00:35:51.92,"Crystal so much at Kota camp? >> Okay, you want a list?"
574,00:35:55.12,00:35:55.12,">> What'd I do to Randy, really? >> All right."
575,00:35:57.00,00:35:57.00,The first nine days of this game...
576,00:35:58.92,00:35:58.92,>> Mm-hmm. >> ...you made Fang a living
577,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,"hell, you and your boy GC. >> Okay..."
578,00:36:04.12,00:36:04.12,">> You guys were running... Hey, I let you talk."
579,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,You going to let me talk or what?
580,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,>> Speak on. >> All right.
581,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,You and your posse ran the tribe like it was a gang.
582,00:36:13.83,00:36:13.83,"When you guys had power, you guys were arrogant; you were"
583,00:36:17.04,00:36:17.04,hard to get along with. You were causing the division in
584,00:36:20.58,00:36:20.58,our tribe and were the reason that we lost all those times.
585,00:36:24.04,00:36:24.04,">> All right, okay. >> Y-You, you want more?"
586,00:36:26.79,00:36:26.79,">> You feel like you have to say some more, we ain't got nothing"
587,00:36:29.42,00:36:29.42,"but time. >> PROBST: Crystal, you've been"
588,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,"pretty vocal, sharing what's on your mind at times."
589,00:36:39.21,00:36:39.21,Ever regret any of your emotions out here?
590,00:36:41.58,00:36:41.58,">> No, I don't. Yeah, I've cried when I've won."
591,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,I've cried when I lost. I've been called delusional.
592,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,But you can guarantee one thing: this is Crystal.
593,00:36:49.25,00:36:49.25,"What you see is what you get, and if you want the truth, this"
594,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"is Crystal. >> PROBST: Charlie, would you be"
595,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,"a little concerned if you were Randy or Crystal, people who"
596,00:36:58.50,00:36:58.50,have been the most vocal tonight firing arrows back and forth?
597,00:37:02.50,00:37:02.50,>> I think that if you're just saying something just for your
598,00:37:05.29,00:37:05.29,"own selfish reasons to get it off your chest, that doesn't"
599,00:37:08.21,00:37:08.21,make sense. I definitely think you need to
600,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,"process what comes out of your mouth, especially in this unique"
601,00:37:12.75,00:37:12.75,"circumstance. >> PROBST: Kenny, the nine of"
602,00:37:15.12,00:37:15.12,"you, who have been battling for so long, now come together."
603,00:37:18.29,00:37:18.29,"Do opinions start to change? >> Well, like, with Charlie, for"
604,00:37:22.04,00:37:22.04,"instance, I didn't know too much about Charlie, and I like"
605,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,"Charlie. Just talking with him, I know"
606,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,"that he's a nice guy. >> PROBST: Charlie, has your"
607,00:37:30.29,00:37:30.29,opinion of Kenny changed now that you've spent some time with
608,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,him? >> Not at all.
609,00:37:33.79,00:37:33.79,"I thought Kenny was a great guy when I met him, so my opinion"
610,00:37:36.79,00:37:36.79,has stayed the same and I've continued to develop a
611,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,"friendship with Kenny. >> PROBST: Randy, is there"
612,00:37:41.46,00:37:41.46,"anybody that changed for you? >> Yeah, Kenny, he's, he's, he's"
613,00:37:45.88,00:37:45.88,not a little kid anymore. He's definitely grown up and
614,00:37:49.04,00:37:49.04,that's not the Kenny I saw weeks ago.
615,00:37:51.62,00:37:51.62,">> PROBST: Let's talk about your time out here, Sugar."
616,00:37:55.12,00:37:55.12,Can it actually be an advantage to have spent so many times away
617,00:37:57.88,00:37:57.88,from the game on Exile because you didn't have the same
618,00:38:00.62,00:38:00.62,opportunity to irritate people that Randy did and Crystal did?
619,00:38:04.75,00:38:04.75,">> Um, being away from everybody just gives them a chance to talk"
620,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,about me more. I would not annoy everybody.
621,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,I don't hurt people's feelings and I don't talk crap about
622,00:38:14.38,00:38:14.38,people behind their backs and I have a good idea of who
623,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,"everybody is. >> PROBST: All right, Susie, you"
624,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,have individual immunity unless you want to assign that to
625,00:38:26.08,00:38:26.08,someone else. >> Let me think about that.
626,00:38:28.12,00:38:28.12,"(laughter) Nope, I'm gonna keep it."
627,00:38:30.75,00:38:30.75,">> PROBST: All right, you cannot vote for Susie."
628,00:38:32.38,00:38:32.38,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
629,00:38:34.96,00:38:34.96,"Randy, you're up. >> (whispering): Bitch."
630,00:39:10.08,00:39:10.08,">> (whispering): Sorry, Charlie. >> (whispering): You took out my"
631,00:39:23.25,00:39:23.25,"Marcus, and that makes me really mad."
632,00:39:48.79,00:39:48.79,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
633,00:39:57.38,00:39:57.38,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
634,00:40:00.67,00:40:00.67,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
635,00:40:05.21,00:40:05.21,"Okay. Once the votes are read, the"
636,00:40:07.12,00:40:07.12,decision is final. The person voted out will be
637,00:40:09.25,00:40:09.25,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
638,00:40:11.46,00:40:11.46,I'll read the votes. First vote: Crystal.
639,00:40:20.62,00:40:20.62,"Who cast this vote? >> Uh, C.C., Crystal Cox."
640,00:40:23.88,00:40:23.88,>> PROBST: If you don't want somebody to know who you voted
641,00:40:25.83,00:40:25.83,"for, you got to write a name down."
642,00:40:27.92,00:40:27.92,Otherwise I have to ask. That's two votes Crystal.
643,00:40:34.17,00:40:34.17,Crystal. Three votes Crystal.
644,00:40:40.00,00:40:40.00,Crystal. Four votes Crystal.
645,00:40:46.42,00:40:46.42,Charlie. Four votes Crystal;
646,00:40:49.83,00:40:49.83,one vote Charlie. Charlie.
647,00:40:54.83,00:40:54.83,Four votes Crystal; two votes Charlie.
648,00:41:00.42,00:41:00.42,Charlie. That's four votes Crystal;
649,00:41:03.79,00:41:03.79,three votes Charlie. Charlie.
650,00:41:08.25,00:41:08.25,Four votes Crystal;  four votes Charlie.
651,00:41:11.21,00:41:11.21,One vote left. Tenth person voted out of
652,00:41:17.50,00:41:17.50,Survivor: Gabon  and the second member of our jury: Charlie.
653,00:41:24.00,00:41:24.00,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Good job, guys."
654,00:41:32.96,00:41:32.96,">> PROBST: Charlie, the tribe has spoken."
655,00:41:39.08,00:41:39.08,Time for you to go. >> Have fun.
656,00:41:46.83,00:41:46.83,>> PROBST: One thing tonight's Tribal Council made clear to me
657,00:41:50.58,00:41:50.58,"is that the merge has had an impact on this game, and it"
658,00:41:53.88,00:41:53.88,should make for a crazy finish. Grab your torches.
659,00:41:57.29,00:41:57.29,Head back to camp. Good night.

666,00:42:25.75,00:42:25.75,>> PROBST: Randy stirs up the camp.
667,00:42:27.46,00:42:27.46,>> He is wreaking havoc. >> I think he's crazy.
668,00:42:28.88,00:42:28.88,>> You're on the outs. The final three in this game is
669,00:42:30.54,00:42:30.54,"Kenny, Susie, and Crystal. You're not part of it."
670,00:42:32.46,00:42:32.46,">> We have to get this right. If we get this right,"
671,00:42:34.12,00:42:34.12,the whole game will change. >> PROBST: But Kenny will not be
672,00:42:36.04,00:42:36.04,"denied. >> Okay, this is a disaster."
673,00:42:49.25,00:42:49.25,I 100% did not see this coming. But what can you do at this
674,00:42:54.04,00:42:54.04,point? And I didn't think I would make
675,00:42:56.08,00:42:56.08,"it past the first Tribal, so to make it this far is amazing."
676,00:42:58.92,00:42:58.92,"If I'm going to leave  Survivor, I'm glad it's a blindside."
677,00:43:01.50,00:43:01.50,Thank God Marcus is in the jury house.
678,00:43:03.38,00:43:03.38,That is my saving grace. I can't wait to see Marcus.
