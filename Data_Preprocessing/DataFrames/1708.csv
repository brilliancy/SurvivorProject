566,00:35:37.08,00:35:37.08,"anybody, it's clear.It's not any gray area."
567,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,"This is where Crystal stands.>> Okay, w-why...?"
568,00:35:42.29,00:35:42.29,">> W-W-Wait, I let you finish.Let me finish."

579,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,>> Speak on.>> All right.
580,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,You and your posse ran the tribelike it was a gang.
581,00:36:13.83,00:36:13.83,"When you guys had power, youguys were arrogant; you were"
582,00:36:17.04,00:36:17.04,hard to get along with.You were causing the division in
583,00:36:20.58,00:36:20.58,our tribe and were the reasonthat we lost all those times.
584,00:36:24.04,00:36:24.04,">> All right, okay.>> Y-You, you want more?"
585,00:36:26.79,00:36:26.79,">> You feel like you have to saysome more, we ain't got nothing"

587,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,"pretty vocal, sharing what's onyour mind at times."
588,00:36:39.21,00:36:39.21,Ever regret any of your emotionsout here?
589,00:36:41.58,00:36:41.58,">> No, I don't.Yeah, I've cried when I've won."
590,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,I've cried when I lost.I've been called delusional.
591,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,But you can guarantee one thing:this is Crystal.
592,00:36:49.25,00:36:49.25,"What you see is what you get,and if you want the truth, this"
593,00:36:52.17,00:36:52.17,"is Crystal.>> PROBST: Charlie, would you be"
594,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,"a little concerned if you wereRandy or Crystal, people who"
595,00:36:58.50,00:36:58.50,have been the most vocal tonightfiring arrows back and forth?
596,00:37:02.50,00:37:02.50,>> I think that if you're justsaying something just for your

598,00:37:08.21,00:37:08.21,make sense.I definitely think you need to
599,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,"process what comes out of yourmouth, especially in this unique"
600,00:37:12.75,00:37:12.75,"circumstance.>> PROBST: Kenny, the nine of"
601,00:37:15.12,00:37:15.12,"you, who have been battling forso long, now come together."
602,00:37:18.29,00:37:18.29,"Do opinions start to change?>> Well, like, with Charlie, for"
603,00:37:22.04,00:37:22.04,"instance, I didn't know too muchabout Charlie, and I like"
604,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,"Charlie.Just talking with him, I know"
605,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,"that he's a nice guy.>> PROBST: Charlie, has your"
606,00:37:30.29,00:37:30.29,opinion of Kenny changed nowthat you've spent some time with
607,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,him?>> Not at all.
608,00:37:33.79,00:37:33.79,"I thought Kenny was a great guywhen I met him, so my opinion"
609,00:37:36.79,00:37:36.79,has stayed the same and I'vecontinued to develop a
610,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,"friendship with Kenny.>> PROBST: Randy, is there"
611,00:37:41.46,00:37:41.46,"anybody that changed for you?>> Yeah, Kenny, he's, he's, he's"
612,00:37:45.88,00:37:45.88,not a little kid anymore.He's definitely grown up and
613,00:37:49.04,00:37:49.04,that's not the Kenny I saw weeksago.
614,00:37:51.62,00:37:51.62,">> PROBST: Let's talk about yourtime out here, Sugar."
615,00:37:55.12,00:37:55.12,Can it actually be an advantageto have spent so many times away
616,00:37:57.88,00:37:57.88,from the game on Exile becauseyou didn't have the same
617,00:38:00.62,00:38:00.62,opportunity to irritate peoplethat Randy did and Crystal did?
618,00:38:04.75,00:38:04.75,">> Um, being away from everybodyjust gives them a chance to talk"
619,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,about me more.I would not annoy everybody.
620,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,I don't hurt people's feelingsand I don't talk crap about
621,00:38:14.38,00:38:14.38,people behind their backs and Ihave a good idea of who
622,00:38:18.33,00:38:18.33,"everybody is.>> PROBST: All right, Susie, you"

624,00:38:26.08,00:38:26.08,someone else.>> Let me think about that.
625,00:38:28.12,00:38:28.12,"(laughter)Nope, I'm gonna keep it."
626,00:38:30.75,00:38:30.75,">> PROBST: All right, you cannotvote for Susie."
