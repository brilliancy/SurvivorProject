57,00:03:12.90,00:03:12.90,THEY WON'T WANT TO WORK WITH US BECAUSE WE TURNED ON ONE OF OUR
58,00:03:15.87,00:03:15.87,CORE SIX. >> I WANT CORRINE TO BE THE NEXT
59,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10,PERSON GONE BUT IF I CAN NOT GET RID OF CORRINE AND HER NEW GAY

67,00:04:17.40,00:04:17.40,THE TREEMAIL DID SAY THE STRONG WILL CARRY THE WEEK.
68,00:04:20.87,00:04:20.87,WE HAVE PLENTY OF THE LATTER CATEGORY SO IF THE SUCCESS OF
69,00:04:23.57,00:04:23.57,THIS CHALLENGE DEPENDS ON THE EXISTENCE OF WEAK PEOPLE WE GOT

79,00:04:54.00,00:04:54.00,I DON'T BLOW UP LIKE MUSCLE BODY BUILDERS AND IT'S DECENTIVE
80,00:04:58.47,00:04:58.47,BECAUSE WHEN YOU GRAB SOMEONE YOU CAN GENERALLY PULL THEM OR
81,00:05:02.10,00:05:02.10,HOLD THEM A LOT LONGER BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU CAN.
82,00:05:08.63,00:05:08.63,THIS CHALLENGE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH STRENGTH AND I THINK FOR
83,00:05:14.23,00:05:14.23,A LOT OF THEM THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT.
84,00:05:15.63,00:05:15.63,I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE BUT I BELIEVE AS A PERSON AND A
85,00:05:17.90,00:05:17.90,MAN NOBODY IN THE OTHER TRIBE CAN BEAT ME ARM WRESTLING.

87,00:05:26.07,00:05:26.07,WITH GREAT BIG MUSCLES WHO LOOKS AT ME AND THINKS HE CAN BEAT ME.
88,00:05:29.30,00:05:29.30,SO PART OF MY TECHNIQUE WHEN I GO IS TO GET THE GUY COME THAT
89,00:05:32.73,00:05:32.73,WAY. THEN I TURN THAT WRIST LIKE THAT
90,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,DOWN LIKE THAT. >> PHILLIP CHALLENGED ME TO AN
91,00:05:39.70,00:05:39.70,ARM WRESTLING MATCH. HE NATURALLY WAS ABLE TO BEAT ME
92,00:05:45.30,00:05:45.30,QUICKLY. >> PUT BOTH HANDS ON IT.
93,00:05:47.30,00:05:47.30,READY? PUT MY HAND DOWN.
94,00:05:49.33,00:05:49.33,"PUT ALL YOUR WEIGHT ON IT, MAN! GET ON YOUR KNEES."

98,00:06:06.57,00:06:06.57,STRENGTH. I PUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF
99,00:06:07.90,00:06:07.90,MY WEIGHT ON HIS FOREARM AND HE MANAGED TO KEEP IT OFF THE
100,00:06:11.37,00:06:11.37,"GROUND AND IF THE SMILE ON PHILLIP'S FACE AFTER THAT, I"
101,00:06:16.40,00:06:16.40,THINK HE FELT LIKE THE OLD PHILLIP -- OR THE YOUNG PHILLIP.
102,00:06:19.23,00:06:19.23,>> I FEEL CONFIDENT. I WAS FEELING CONFIDENT BUT I
103,00:06:21.50,00:06:21.50,FEEL MORE CONFIDENT. IN CHANNELS MY ASSET IS MY WILL
104,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50,OF A LION AND MY DETERMINATION OF A GORILLA.

211,00:12:09.57,00:12:09.57,BUT THAT'S WHAT IT IS. HE SEES ALL OF HIS STRENGTHS AND
212,00:12:12.60,00:12:12.60,"NONE OF HIS WEAKNESSES. >> OH, MY GOD!"
213,00:12:40.10,00:12:40.10,MUFFIN! MUFFIN?

226,00:13:34.40,00:13:34.40,SWEET SPOT. NO PUN INTENDED.
227,00:13:39.40,00:13:39.40,(LAUGHS) THIS ONE IS REALLY GOOD.
228,00:13:42.73,00:13:42.73,WINNING A REWARD LIKE THIS HELPS TO SOLIDIFY BONDS BETWEEN PEOPLE

237,00:14:08.43,00:14:08.43,REALLY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A
238,00:14:10.10,00:14:10.10,GAME GOING ON AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT I KNOW I'M GOING TO
239,00:14:13.53,00:14:13.53,BE IN TROUBLE WHEN IT COMES MERGE TIME NO ONE WANTS TO GO TO
240,00:14:16.67,00:14:16.67,THE END WITH ME. NOT THAT I BLAME THEM BUT I HAVE
241,00:14:18.70,00:14:18.70,TO MAKE MY MOVE SOON. I'M KEEPING A SMILE BUT GETTING
242,00:14:21.80,00:14:21.80,MY PIECES READY TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS GAME.

247,00:14:42.70,00:14:42.70,JUST A MATTER OF TIME. AND THEY HAD YOUTH SO THEY HAD
248,00:14:46.30,00:14:46.30,EVERY COMPONENT THEY NEEDED TO WIN THAT CHALLENGE.
249,00:14:48.57,00:14:48.57,>> WE JUST LOST OUR REWARD CHALLENGE AND I'M GOING TO BLAME

257,00:15:10.80,00:15:10.80,HE'S A LOOSE PEN POUNDS OF POTATOES IN A FIVE-POUND SACK.
258,00:15:15.30,00:15:15.30,HE'S JUST A MESS. BUT EVERYONE ELSE SEES HIS TRUE
259,00:15:18.53,00:15:18.53,COLORS AND HE BLOWS THE NEXT CHALLENGE FOR US MAYBE WE TAKE
260,00:15:20.63,00:15:20.63,HIM OUT. I COULD HAVE TAKEN EVERYBODY'S
261,00:15:22.77,00:15:22.77,WEIGHTS AND DONE THE ENTIRE THING MYSELF AND WON IT.
262,00:15:25.03,00:15:25.03,HE'S THE WORST. >> HE HAS THIS INFLATED SENSE OF
263,00:15:32.23,00:15:32.23,"I'M THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD, I'M MR. UNIVERSE"
264,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,STKWHR-FPLT IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. I DON'T WANT TO KEEP PLAYING
265,00:15:37.23,00:15:37.23,THIS GAME WITH HIM. >> YEAH.
266,00:15:41.13,00:15:41.13,PHILLIP AND CORRINE HATE EACH OTHER.
267,00:15:42.53,00:15:42.53,THERE'S SO MUCH FRACTURE AND DIVISION WITHIN THE FAVORITES ON
268,00:15:45.03,00:15:45.03,THIS TRIPE IT'S LIKE A DEATH SENTENCE.
269,00:15:47.23,00:15:47.23,SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER.
270,00:15:48.87,00:15:48.87,>> IT'S A JOKE. >> I'M GOING TO BE PUSHING THAT
271,00:15:50.93,00:15:50.93,WE CERTAINLY VOTE OFF A FAN WHICH IS NOT EVEN A CERTAINTY
272,00:15:58.33,00:15:58.33,"BECAUSE MICHAEL HAS GOTTEN VERY, VERY CLOSE WITH CORRINE."
273,00:16:00.80,00:16:00.80,">> IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW WE CAN REEL HIM IN, PLEASE LET"

275,00:16:06.20,00:16:06.20,SUCH A NONENTITY OUT HERE. I'M TEMPTED TO SAY SHE HAS A
276,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,VANILLA PERSONALITY BUT I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD BE DOING A GREAT
277,00:16:12.90,00:16:12.90,DISSERVICE TO THE FLAVOR VANILLA.
278,00:16:14.97,00:16:14.97,PEOPLE ACTIVELY SEEK OUT VANILLA-FLAVORED PRODUCTS.
279,00:16:17.83,00:16:17.83,CHILDREN CLAMOR TO GET VANILLA ICE CREAM CONE.
280,00:16:20.70,00:16:20.70,NOBODY IS CLAMORING FOR ANYTHING JULIA-FLAVORED.
281,00:16:24.13,00:16:24.13,"EXCEPT FOR PHILLIP. PHILLIP HAS GROWN VERY, VERY"
282,00:16:26.33,00:16:26.33,CLOSE TO JULIA. AND I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY.
283,00:16:29.40,00:16:29.40,>> IF YOU WERE TO SURVIVE AND MAKE IT TO THE MERGE I'D WANT
284,00:16:34.83,00:16:34.83,"YOU TO BE FRIEND WITH YOUR OTHER TRIBE MATES, LEARN WHAT YOU"
285,00:16:37.97,00:16:37.97,LEARN AND DON'T GO BACK. MIGHT AS WELL BE A PART OF THE
286,00:16:41.87,00:16:41.87,"WINNING STRATEGY AND SAY, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
287,00:16:43.87,00:16:43.87,I MADE A BIG MOVE. THE PROBLEM WITH BEING A DOUBLE
288,00:16:47.10,00:16:47.10,AGENT IS-- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EFFECTIVELY YOU BECOME-- I'D
289,00:16:51.17,00:16:51.17,LIKE TO MAKE YOU ONE OF THE BEST.
290,00:16:53.70,00:16:53.70,>> UNDERSTOOD. >> DON'T SHARE IT WITH ANYONE
291,00:16:56.83,00:16:56.83,"ELSE, INCLUDING ANY MEMBER OF OUR TRIBE."
292,00:17:00.13,00:17:00.13,I THINK I'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB WITH JULIA AND I THINK I'VE
293,00:17:03.93,00:17:03.93,GOT MY FIRST DOUBLE AGENT. I SHARE WITH HER SOME
294,00:17:06.97,00:17:06.97,INFORMATION AND I TOLD HER DON'T SHARE IT WITH ANYONE ELSE.
295,00:17:09.83,00:17:09.83,IF SHE FEELS SHE'S IN TROUBLE SHE CAN LET ME KNOW AND I'LL DO
296,00:17:12.77,00:17:12.77,EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE SHE STAYS IN THE GAME.
297,00:17:15.37,00:17:15.37,I CAN'T SAY EXACTLY WHERE YOU WOULD END.
298,00:17:19.67,00:17:19.67,>> YEAH? >> BUT YOU COULD GO FAR.
299,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17,>> WHAT'S INTERESTING WITH Phil THAT I DON'T FIND HIM TO
300,00:17:24.23,00:17:24.23,AN INTIMIDATING CHARACTER AT ALL.
301,00:17:26.20,00:17:26.20,BUT WHEN HE'S LIKELY TELL YOU TO DO THIS AND YOU WILL DO IT.
302,00:17:30.03,00:17:30.03,I UNDERSTAND THAT AT THIS POINT IF I HAVE ANY HOPE OF STAYING IN
303,00:17:32.23,00:17:32.23,THE GAME THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO.
304,00:17:34.50,00:17:34.50,>> FULLY UNDERSTOOD. BUT IT COMES A POINT WHEN HE'S
305,00:17:37.70,00:17:37.70,GOING TO REALLY DESTRUCT THE UNITY OF THE TRIBE BY DRIVING
306,00:17:42.43,00:17:42.43,EVERYONE CRAZY SO WHY NOT GET RID OF HIM?
307,00:18:07.47,00:18:07.47,">> SO WE HAVE SEVEN HERE, THEY HAVE SIX."
308,00:18:09.77,00:18:09.77,>> THEY HAVE SIX. IMMUNITY TOMORROW.
309,00:18:17.13,00:18:17.13,">> YEAH, I KNOW. >> WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME"
310,00:18:20.30,00:18:20.30,"PROBLEM, IT'S EASY TO BRING THEM TOGETHER."
311,00:18:22.07,00:18:22.07,"AND THE FOUR ALPHA MALES IN THIS GAME-- BEING MYSELF, REYNOLD,"
312,00:18:26.70,00:18:26.70,EDDIE AND ERIC-- ARE GOING TO HAVE A BIG PROBLEM COME MERGE
313,00:18:29.20,00:18:29.20,TIME. THE ATHLETIC GUYS ARE GOING TO
314,00:18:30.90,00:18:30.90,GET TARGETED AND KNOCKED OUT OF THE GAME.
315,00:18:34.63,00:18:34.63,WHAT I NEED TO DO IS SPEARHEAD HAVING THESE FOUR GUYS JOIN
316,00:18:38.37,00:18:38.37,FORCES. >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STICK
317,00:18:40.10,00:18:40.10,"TOGETHER GOING INTO THE MERGE. THE FOUR OF US, THE GUYS, ARE"
318,00:18:42.43,00:18:42.43,GOING TO BE THE FIRST FOUR TARGETS.
319,00:18:44.43,00:18:44.43,WE KNOW THAT. IT'S GOT TO BE THE FOUR GUYS.
320,00:18:46.93,00:18:46.93,I'LL BRING IN ERIC AND YOU HAVE TO BRING IN EDDIE.
321,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,>> EDDIE AND ARE 100% FULL DISCLOSURE EACH-TO-EACH OTHER
322,00:18:54.80,00:18:54.80,TIGHT HONEST. AND I AM FULLY ON THE PAGE WITH
323,00:18:56.83,00:18:56.83,"THAT. UP TO THIS POINT, I'VE BEEN LIED"
324,00:18:58.47,00:18:58.47,TO A LOT BY MY PREVIOUS TRIBE SO AT THIS POINT THE ONLY PERSON I
325,00:19:02.23,00:19:02.23,BELIEVE IS EDDIE. I BELIEVE YOU.
326,00:19:04.30,00:19:04.30,BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE TALKING TO ME RIGHT NOW.
327,00:19:06.20,00:19:06.20,>> WE'RE IN THE SAME BOAT. >> IN A GAME WHERE YOU CAN NOT
328,00:19:10.67,00:19:10.67,TRUST ANYBODY IT'S HARD TO TELL. YOU STILL HAVE TO KIND OF RELY
329,00:19:13.53,00:19:13.53,ON YOUR INSTINCTS. >> WE'RE THE SAME CHARACTER.
330,00:19:16.03,00:19:16.03,>> THE EXACT SAME PERSON. >> AND MALCOLM JUST STRIKES ME
331,00:19:18.97,00:19:18.97,AS THE TYPE OF GUY THAT IS LIKE ME AND HE SEES THAT I CAN HELP
332,00:19:22.70,00:19:22.70,HIM AND HE CAN DEFINITELY HELP ME.
333,00:19:24.33,00:19:24.33,SO THIS ONE FEELS RIGHT AND THIS WILL BE THE ONE THAT IS THE NAIL
334,00:19:27.47,00:19:27.47,IN THE COFFIN FOR ME IF I'M WRONG.
335,00:19:30.80,00:19:30.80,WOULD THEY TELL YOU IF THEY WERE GOING FOR ME?
336,00:19:32.57,00:19:32.57,">> YEAH, BECAUSE THEY THINK I'M ON BOARD AND IF IT IS, LIKE,"
337,00:19:35.90,00:19:35.90,WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. >> WILL YOU TELL ME?
338,00:19:37.63,00:19:37.63,">> YEAH, I WILL. IF YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF I'LL"
339,00:19:41.00,00:19:41.00,TELL YOU. >> I HAVE THE IDOL.
340,00:19:42.67,00:19:42.67,>> I WILL DEFINITELY TELL YOU. >> DON'T MENTION ABOUT THE IDOL.
341,00:19:45.27,00:19:45.27,">> ALL RIGHT, SICK. >> IF I DIDN'T COMPLETELY TRUST"
342,00:19:48.67,00:19:48.67,"REYNOLD AFTER SELLING HIM ON THIS IDEA, I TRUST HIM NOW"
343,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80,BECAUSE HE'S GONE SO OVER THE TOP UNNECESSARILY TO PROVE HIS
344,00:19:54.60,00:19:54.60,LOYAL THEY HE'S TOLD ME ABOUT HIS IDOL.
345,00:19:58.00,00:19:58.00,I'VE HAD AN IDOL SINCE DAY FOUR. I WOULDN'T OFFER TO DO THAT FOR
346,00:20:01.50,00:20:01.50,SOME STRANGER WHO JUST CAME TO ME SO WITH THIS INFORMATION I'M
347,00:20:03.97,00:20:03.97,THE ONLY ONE IN THE GAME WHO KNOWS WHERE BOTH IDOLS ARE AND I
348,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON SOME PEOPLE'S FACES WHEN I TAKE
349,00:20:09.63,00:20:09.63,"CONTROL OF THIS GAME. GOD, I CAN'T WAIT!"
350,00:20:12.63,00:20:12.63,(LAUGHS)  I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
351,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,THINKING NEXT STAGE IN THE GAME. >> OBVIOUSLY WHATEVER YOUR
352,00:20:33.63,00:20:33.63,DYNAMIC IS WITH PHIL THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.
353,00:20:35.40,00:20:35.40,THE THING IS THAT I TALKED WITH PHIL AND HE GAVE ME THE SENSE
354,00:20:38.80,00:20:38.80,THAT MAYBE HE WOULD WANT TO TAKE ME ALONG FOR NEIGHBOR A NEW
355,00:20:42.07,00:20:42.07,ALLIANCE HE WANTS TO DO AFTER THE MERGE.
356,00:20:43.23,00:20:43.23,SO PART OF ME FELT A LITTLE INDEBTED TO HIM BUT I FEEL LIKE
357,00:20:47.03,00:20:47.03,I'M BEING BULLIED. >> I THINK HE'S TRYING TO BRING
358,00:20:51.13,00:20:51.13,YOU IN. >> LIKE HE'S PLAYING HIS GAME --
359,00:20:53.23,00:20:53.23,>> FOR HIM. >> AT THIS POINT IT'S WORKING
360,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,"FOR ME, TOO. >> JULIA APPROACHED ME AND JUST"
361,00:20:59.63,00:20:59.63,"SAID ""PHILLIP REALLY WANTS ME TO WORK WITH HIM."
362,00:21:02.67,00:21:02.67,"I'M OKAY WORKING UNDER HIM IF THAT KEEPS ME IN THE GAME."""
363,00:21:05.50,00:21:05.50,>> WHAT IF EVERYONE JUST OVERTHREW PHIL.
364,00:21:07.83,00:21:07.83,I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO BUT WHAT'S STOPPING
365,00:21:10.73,00:21:10.73,PEOPLE? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE DYNAMIC
366,00:21:12.77,00:21:12.77,IS. BASED ON THE TIME I'VE SPENT
367,00:21:14.53,00:21:14.53,WITH JULIA SHE WASN'T SEEMS VERY AWARE OF THE GAME SO IT'S
368,00:21:17.73,00:21:17.73,HELPFUL TO KNOW SHE'S THINKING MORE THAN WE THOUGHT SHE WAS.
369,00:21:20.67,00:21:20.67,"JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO SAY A SINGLE THING TO"
370,00:21:25.17,00:21:25.17,"ANYBODY. >> OH, OH, OH!"
371,00:21:29.37,00:21:29.37,JULIA APPROACHED ME AND SHE'S LIKE HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ME IF

373,00:21:35.53,00:21:35.53,FOR ME LONG TERM. >> SHE'S AN IDIOT.

488,00:28:49.73,00:28:49.73,SPIRITS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY A LITTLE BIT LOW.
489,00:28:52.00,00:28:52.00,WE JUST LOST. AND PHILLIP WAS SULKING AROUND
490,00:28:55.37,00:28:55.37,EYEING OUT EVERYBODY AND THEN HE QUICKLY AND COVERTLY PULLED ME
491,00:29:01.73,00:29:01.73,ASIDE AND WHISPERED INTENSELY -- >> I HAVE A CONFESSION.
492,00:29:04.70,00:29:04.70,>> AND MY MIND STARTS RACING INSTANTLY.
493,00:29:07.13,00:29:07.13,HAS HE DONE SOMETHING AROUND CAMP.
494,00:29:08.67,00:29:08.67,IS HE GOING TO BETRAY CORRINE TONIGHT?
495,00:29:10.77,00:29:10.77,WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE? >> I LOVE WHAT JEFF HAD IN STORE
496,00:29:14.50,00:29:14.50,FOR US TODAY FOR THE CHALLENGE. IT WAS AN IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
497,00:29:17.63,00:29:17.63,"WE WERE CLOSE IN THE CHALLENGE, PROBABLY COULD HAVE WON THAT"
498,00:29:21.87,00:29:21.87,CHALLENGE-- HAD I WANTED TO. I DIDN'T WANT TO WIN THAT
499,00:29:25.03,00:29:25.03,CHALLENGE. >> (LAUGHS)
500,00:29:25.73,00:29:25.73,I KNEW YOU WERE GOING SAY THAT. >> OKAY?
501,00:29:28.37,00:29:28.37,I COULDN'T SEE JULIE AT THE MERGE.
502,00:29:31.07,00:29:31.07,>> IT ALL MAKES SENSE! WE HAD TO THROW THE CHALLENGE IN
503,00:29:33.97,00:29:33.97,ORDER TO GET RID OF ONE OF THESE FANS OR ELSE WE WERE DOOMED.
504,00:29:37.13,00:29:37.13,AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY PHILLIP WAS UNABLE TO
505,00:29:40.33,00:29:40.33,SUCCESSFULLY THROW A GRAPPLING HOOK.
506,00:29:42.70,00:29:42.70,"I MEAN, IT'S COMPLETE CRAP. >> IT HIT ME ONCE I SAW IT WAS A"
507,00:29:47.97,00:29:47.97,"GRAPPLING HOOK, I'LL MAKE A GALLANT EFFORT BUT IT WON'T BE"
508,00:29:51.43,00:29:51.43,WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE TOSSED IT SLIGHTLY
509,00:29:54.40,00:29:54.40,DIFFERENTLY. >> YOU CAN'T MAKE UP THIS LEVEL
510,00:29:56.33,00:29:56.33,OF DELUSION AND THAT'S WHAT EXCITES ME ABOUT PLAYING WITH
511,00:29:59.03,00:29:59.03,PHILLIP. I THINK HE'S CONVINCED HE THREW
512,00:30:00.80,00:30:00.80,THE CHALLENGE. SOME OF THE RAZZLE DAZZLE.
513,00:30:03.20,00:30:03.20,">> SLOWING IT DOWN, PULLING IT BACK."
514,00:30:05.87,00:30:05.87,I WOULD HAVE BEEN HUSTLING TO GET IT BACK.
515,00:30:07.33,00:30:07.33,">> HE WASN'T THROWING THE CHALLENGE, HE WAS TRYING HIS"
516,00:30:10.33,00:30:10.33,"HARDEST, HE WAS IN FULL SPY MODE."
517,00:30:12.37,00:30:12.37,CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SPEECH HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN AT CAMP HAD HE
518,00:30:15.93,00:30:15.93,"SUCCESSFULLY THROWN A GRAPPLING HOOK, THE SPY'S BASIC TOOL, AT A"
519,00:30:20.00,00:30:20.00,CHALLENGE AND WON THE CHALLENGE FOR US?
520,00:30:21.60,00:30:21.60,IT'S JUST -- (LAUGHS) IT'S ABSURD!
521,00:30:26.37,00:30:26.37,">> WHEN A LION, THE MALE LION WITH HIS MANE WHEN HE COMESES"
522,00:30:30.17,00:30:30.17,ACROSS ANOTHER PRIDE OF LIONS OF FEMALES AND THERE'S CUBS AND THE
523,00:30:33.33,00:30:33.33,"MALE ISN'T AROUND, WHAT DOES HE DO?"
524,00:30:35.57,00:30:35.57,HE KILLS ALL THE CUBS. >> (LAUGHS)
525,00:30:37.90,00:30:37.90,>> YOU KNOW WHY? THOSE ARE POTENTIAL RIVALS.
526,00:30:41.60,00:30:41.60,SO TODAY -- >> TAKING OUT THE CUBS.
527,00:30:43.20,00:30:43.20,>> TAKING OUT THE CUBS. >> WE'RE STILL ON BOARD WITH
528,00:30:46.37,00:30:46.37,"SLITTING, RIGHT? >> WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT BECAUSE"
529,00:30:48.03,00:30:48.03,WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL.
530,00:30:50.07,00:30:50.07,>> THE NUMBERS ARE FOUR FAVORITES AND TWO FANS.
531,00:30:53.70,00:30:53.70,THAT NUMBERS ADVANTAGE MEANS THAT THE FOUR OF US CAN SPLIT
532,00:30:56.13,00:30:56.13,"OUR VOTES ACROSS THE TWO REMAINING FANS, FLUSH OUT ANY"
533,00:30:59.87,00:30:59.87,POSSIBLE IDOLS AND AND WE CAN GET RID OF JULIA.
534,00:31:05.23,00:31:05.23,>I STILL THINK WE SHOULD SPLIT THE VOTES.
535,00:31:08.63,00:31:08.63,>> I'M NOT SPLITTING. >> I THINK WE SHOULD.
536,00:31:10.57,00:31:10.57,>> THERE'S NO REASON. >> IT'S COMMON SENSE.
537,00:31:12.73,00:31:12.73,WHY NOT? IF WE HAVE THE NUMBERS WHY NOT
538,00:31:15.13,00:31:15.13,DO IT. >> WHY ARE YOU WORRIED?
539,00:31:16.67,00:31:16.67,>> BECAUSE AS SOON AS WE MERGE I WANT MIKE TO WORK WITH US LONG
540,00:31:20.03,00:31:20.03,TERM SO I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE HE
541,00:31:22.63,00:31:22.63,"FEELS SAFE, COMFORTABLE, AND TRUSTS US."
542,00:31:26.13,00:31:26.13,I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SPLITTING VOTES BECAUSE TO ME I
543,00:31:28.70,00:31:28.70,"KNOW I WANT TO SEND JULIA HOME, I KNOW THERE'S NO IDOL BECAUSE I"
544,00:31:31.83,00:31:31.83,HAVE THE IDOL WITH MALCOLM AND I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO A MERGE

561,00:32:15.73,00:32:15.73,HAS TO BE A SHOW OF UNITY. JUST A MOMENT HIM THINKING THAT
562,00:32:18.57,00:32:18.57,WE ARE NOT 100% BEHIND HIM. I'M NOT AN IDIOT.
563,00:32:21.87,00:32:21.87,I DO SEE IT AND I SEE HER PUTTING HER SELFISH INTERESTS
564,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,ABOVE THE FAVORITES. THE FOUR ALLIANCE THAT'S ON THE
565,00:32:29.60,00:32:29.60,"BEACH RIGHT NOW IS THE THREE OF US, NOT CORRINE."

570,00:32:43.37,00:32:43.37,AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT B.R. WOULD DO IN THIS SITUATION.

592,00:33:36.27,00:33:36.27,I WOULD KICK HIS ASS BUT FOR ME IT'S A WAITING GAME UNTIL I GET
593,00:33:40.90,00:33:40.90,TO HOLD UP THAT PARCHMENT AND GO THIS IS WHAT BOSTON ROB WOULD
594,00:33:44.07,00:33:44.07,"HAVE DONE. >> LIKE, I'M NOT STUPID."
595,00:33:45.90,00:33:45.90,">> OKAY. >> I AM VERY, VERY CONCERNED"
596,00:33:47.80,00:33:47.80,ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. SHE WAS NEVER PART OF THE CORE
597,00:33:50.50,00:33:50.50,ALLIANCE. >> AGREED.
598,00:33:51.13,00:33:51.13,>> I SENSE HER LOVE FOR HIM IS GREATER THAN IT IS FOR ME.
599,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50,>> RIGHT. >> THAT'S A PROBLEM.

601,00:33:58.77,00:33:58.77,MICHAEL. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE PLAN
602,00:33:59.90,00:33:59.90,SET IN STONE BUT IT'S CLEARLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JULIA OR
603,00:34:04.00,00:34:04.00,MICHAEL. IT'S MASKING SOMETHING THAT'S
604,00:34:05.30,00:34:05.30,ABOUT TO COME TO THE SURFACE AND TONIGHT'S VOTE WILL PROBABLY BE
605,00:34:09.73,00:34:09.73,WHAT SETS INTO MOTION A SERIES OF EVENTS THAT COMPLETELY BRING
606,00:34:13.57,00:34:13.57,THIS PHILLIP/CORRINE FEUD TO THE SURFACE AND MAKE IT CLEAR WHY
607,00:34:17.57,00:34:17.57,"THEY CAN'T PLAY TOGETHER. >> Jeff: SO MICHAEL, 19 DAYS"
608,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,"IN, THIS TRIBE IN A STATE OF DESPAIR."
609,00:34:46.47,00:34:46.47,"IS IT HARD TO KEEP MORALE UP? >> OF COURSE, YEAH."
610,00:34:49.27,00:34:49.27,I MEAN MAYBE IT BRINGS OUT A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION IN THE
611,00:34:52.20,00:34:52.20,"TRIBE WHEN MORALE IS LOW. >> Jeff: YA JULIA, IF IT'S"
612,00:34:57.23,00:34:57.23,STILL FANS VERSUS FAVORITES YOU WOULD HAVE A REASON TO BE TENSE.
613,00:35:00.60,00:35:00.60,"WHY WOULD ANYONE ELSE BE TENSE? >> YOU KNOW, THE FAVORITES DO"
614,00:35:03.80,00:35:03.80,HAVE THE NUMBERS AND SO I KNOW THEY'RE THINKING WAY PAST THIS
615,00:35:07.43,00:35:07.43,TRIBAL COUNCIL. THEY HAVE THEIR GAMES AND THEIR
616,00:35:09.90,00:35:09.90,ALLIANCES SO I TOTALLY SEE HOW THEY WOULD BE TENSE AS WELL.
617,00:35:14.13,00:35:14.13,">> Jeff: CORRINE, NOW I'M CONNECTING THE DOTS."
618,00:35:16.27,00:35:16.27,"IS THE TENSION WITHIN THE FOUR FAVORITES COMING DOWN TO ""DO WE"

620,00:35:22.00,00:35:22.00,>> ABSOLUTELY. GOING INTO A POSSIBLE MERGE IS A
621,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,REALLY SERIOUS THING AND YOU DON'T WANT TO SCREWING IN UP
622,00:35:26.97,00:35:26.97,HERE AND THEN REGRET IT DOWN THE LINE.
623,00:35:30.37,00:35:30.37,">> I WANTED TO ADD, JEFF, IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS."
624,00:35:37.20,00:35:37.20,SOMETIMES FOR CORRINE AND MYSELF WE MIGHT CLASH ON A POINT.
625,00:35:40.77,00:35:40.77,WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING BUT THE PROCESS ON
626,00:35:42.87,00:35:42.87,HOW WE GO ABOUT GETTING THERE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

629,00:35:50.60,00:35:50.60,(LAUGHS) BEEN MANY BETWEEN IT.
630,00:35:52.57,00:35:52.57,YEAH. BUT I THINK AN ALLIANCE LIKE
631,00:35:54.00,00:35:54.00,"THIS IS KIND OF ORGANIC, IN A WAY."
632,00:35:56.53,00:35:56.53,I'VE LEARNED THAT IF WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL AT THE END THE
633,00:35:59.83,00:35:59.83,CONFLICT MAY BE OKAY IF WE STAY COMMITTED.
634,00:36:02.53,00:36:02.53,>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
635,00:36:04.53,00:36:04.53,"GREAT JOB ON THE FIRST HALF, FELL APART ON THE SECOND HALF."
636,00:36:07.73,00:36:07.73,"PHILLIP, YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THAT HERO ROLE AGAIN."
637,00:36:10.93,00:36:10.93,">> NO, I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY. I SEE IT AS PUTTING MYSELF IN"
638,00:36:14.07,00:36:14.07,THE ROLE THAT EVERYONE HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN ON THREE OTHER
639,00:36:16.67,00:36:16.67,OCCASIONS WHERE I PREVAILED. >> Jeff: WHO LOST THIS
640,00:36:19.37,00:36:19.37,CHALLENGE TODAY? >> I WOULD SAY I LOST THE
641,00:36:22.70,00:36:22.70,PORTION. >> Jeff: THAT'S WHAT I'M
642,00:36:24.03,00:36:24.03,"TALKING ABOUT. THE GUY WHO SAYS ""GIMME THE"
