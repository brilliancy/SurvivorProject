2,00:00:02.17,00:00:02.17,  JEFF PROBST:  16 Americans  forced to abandon ship
3,00:00:04.60,00:00:04.60, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:08.43,00:00:08.43," Marooned for 39 days,  they must work together"
5,00:00:12.40,00:00:12.40,"  to build shelter,"
6,00:00:13.87,00:00:13.87," find food and survive    the island,"
7,00:00:16.63,00:00:16.63," but ultimately,  it is everyone for themselves."
8,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,  Every third night
9,00:00:21.07,00:00:21.07, they will hike   deep into the jungle
10,00:00:23.50,00:00:23.50, to take part   in the Tribal Council
11,00:00:25.53,00:00:25.53, where they must vote     one of their own
12,00:00:27.07,00:00:27.07, off the island.
13,00:00:28.93,00:00:28.93,"  In the end,   only one will remain"
14,00:00:31.13,00:00:31.13,  and will leave the island
15,00:00:32.97,00:00:32.97,  with $1 million in cash.
16,00:00:37.93,00:00:37.93, Last week on Survivor:
17,00:00:40.20,00:00:40.20,  The merge  was on everyone's mind
18,00:00:41.87,00:00:41.87,  as the two tribes  prepared to become one.
19,00:00:44.73,00:00:44.73,  We do got the merge coming.
20,00:00:46.07,00:00:46.07,  ( growling )
21,00:00:47.67,00:00:47.67," JEFF:    At Tagi, Rich was flexing"
22,00:00:49.00,00:00:49.00, his voting alliance muscles.
23,00:00:50.73,00:00:50.73,RICHARD:  I am in control
24,00:00:52.63,00:00:52.63,of who's being voted off
25,00:00:54.17,00:00:54.17, and I think that's all   that matters to me.
26,00:00:56.37,00:00:56.37, JEFF:  And Sue was deciding
27,00:00:58.53,00:00:58.53, who on Pagong    should be voted off
28,00:01:00.13,00:01:00.13,  after the merge.
29,00:01:01.40,00:01:01.40,"  Greg, definitely--   he's just way"
30,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63, too psychotic.
31,00:01:04.20,00:01:04.20," JEFF:   At Pagong,  Gervase made a comment"
32,00:01:06.03,00:01:06.03,  that upset  his female tribe mates.
33,00:01:08.10,00:01:08.10, Girls are the stupidest things   on the planet next to cows.
34,00:01:10.27,00:01:10.27,"   Oh! He called us ""stupid."""
35,00:01:13.23,00:01:13.23, Go!
36,00:01:15.13,00:01:15.13, JEFF:  The immunity challenge became    more competitive than ever
37,00:01:16.87,00:01:16.87," because if Pagong won,"
38,00:01:18.43,00:01:18.43,  they would enter the merge     with six members
39,00:01:20.73,00:01:20.73,"  to Tagi's four, giving them    a voting advantage."
40,00:01:23.57,00:01:23.57,"Yeah, you guys!"
41,00:01:24.87,00:01:24.87," JEFF:  But Tagi won,"
42,00:01:26.30,00:01:26.30, insuring them that the tribes    would merge
43,00:01:28.63,00:01:28.63, at five members each.
44,00:01:30.07,00:01:30.07, The loss sent Pagong
45,00:01:31.97,00:01:31.97, back to Tribal Council    where Greg joined the women
46,00:01:35.53,00:01:35.53, in voting Joel off the island.
47,00:01:37.47,00:01:37.47,"  On the eve of the merge,   ten are left."
48,00:01:40.80,00:01:40.80,Who will be the first voted out    of the newly formed tribe?
49,00:01:48.33,00:01:48.33,  ( chanting )

51,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17, JEFF:  Day 19.
52,00:02:43.57,00:02:43.57, Survivor has reached a turning point.
53,00:02:46.33,00:02:46.33,"  Very soon, the ten remaining    members of Tagi and Pagong"
54,00:02:48.93,00:02:48.93,  will form one new tribe.
55,00:02:51.37,00:02:51.37, They will live together     but they will now compete
56,00:02:53.20,00:02:53.20,  against each other   individually.
57,00:02:55.67,00:02:55.67,  There are many questions  to be answered:
58,00:02:57.60,00:02:57.60, Where will they live?
59,00:02:59.50,00:02:59.50,  What will this new tribe     call themselves?
60,00:03:01.40,00:03:01.40,  What kind of world   will they now create?
61,00:03:03.90,00:03:03.90," To begin the process, an ambassador from each tribe--"
62,00:03:07.20,00:03:07.20,  Jenna from Pagong   and Sean from Tagi--
63,00:03:10.23,00:03:10.23,  will assess the livability   of each other's camp.
64,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,  They will then paddle out   to the sand spit for a summit
65,00:03:15.50,00:03:15.50,  where they will negotiate    and decide
66,00:03:17.00,00:03:17.00,  on which of the two beaches
67,00:03:19.30,00:03:19.30, this new tribe of ten    will live.
68,00:03:20.50,00:03:20.50, Their decision will be final.
69,00:03:22.60,00:03:22.60," Sean is being guided     to Pagong Beach by Greg,"
70,00:03:25.30,00:03:25.30,  and Jenna is being guided     to Tagi by Kelly.
71,00:03:28.70,00:03:28.70, This is the first time     either ambassador
72,00:03:30.70,00:03:30.70, has seen the opposing tribe's   camp.
73,00:03:32.90,00:03:32.90, Our camp's way better   than theirs
74,00:03:34.40,00:03:34.40,   just from talking to them.
75,00:03:35.40,00:03:35.40,They don't have
76,00:03:36.40,00:03:36.40,"  a living room with benches,"
77,00:03:37.80,00:03:37.80, never mind a decent kitchen.
78,00:03:39.13,00:03:39.13,  I think our house is better
79,00:03:41.53,00:03:41.53,  from what they've described.
80,00:03:42.73,00:03:42.73, We have fish.
81,00:03:44.10,00:03:44.10,  Gretchen and I both fished   for an hour.
82,00:03:46.13,00:03:46.13, Really?
83,00:03:47.53,00:03:47.53,   Nothing. Not even a bite.
84,00:03:48.53,00:03:48.53, When do you guys fish?
85,00:03:50.07,00:03:50.07,"  Early morning, late evening."
86,00:03:51.47,00:03:51.47,"   Yeah, that's when we fish."
87,00:03:52.93,00:03:52.93," But, you know,  we got the gay guy..."
88,00:03:54.50,00:03:54.50, gay compassionate guy.
89,00:03:55.50,00:03:55.50,"He's, like, middle-of-the-road."
90,00:03:56.77,00:03:56.77,And you got Sue
91,00:03:57.93,00:03:57.93,who says whatever the hell's on her mind.
92,00:03:59.77,00:03:59.77, SUSAN:  As far as somebody coming here
93,00:04:01.70,00:04:01.70,"   from Pagong today,  it's going to be fun."
94,00:04:03.93,00:04:03.93," We like having company   over at camp,"
95,00:04:07.27,00:04:07.27,  even though we don't have a whole lot to offer for lunch.
96,00:04:09.90,00:04:09.90, I'm hoping...   I think the kicker of it all
97,00:04:11.40,00:04:11.40,   will be if Rich gets fish
98,00:04:12.77,00:04:12.77,  and we have fish for lunch.
99,00:04:14.10,00:04:14.10,  I think they'll be here.
100,00:04:15.20,00:04:15.20,And Rich... Rich is a sweetheart.
101,00:04:18.73,00:04:18.73, So easygoing.
102,00:04:19.87,00:04:19.87,   He's naked a lot.
103,00:04:20.87,00:04:20.87,  Um... okay.
104,00:04:22.97,00:04:22.97,"   I'm excited about it being  a big group, because right now"
105,00:04:25.87,00:04:25.87,  there's not a lot     of personalities going on
106,00:04:28.13,00:04:28.13, and it's quiet
107,00:04:29.73,00:04:29.73,"  and we've seen every inch    of this little place here,"
108,00:04:33.30,00:04:33.30," and I'm excited    to meet new people,"
109,00:04:36.03,00:04:36.03,"  and even if it's some good,     some bad,"
110,00:04:38.20,00:04:38.20,"  or whatever,    at least, it's something."
111,00:04:39.77,00:04:39.77,   It's a mix and so it'll be more interesting
112,00:04:41.43,00:04:41.43, than it is right now.
113,00:04:42.77,00:04:42.77,"   Oh, good,  they sent the doctor."
114,00:04:47.67,00:04:47.67,Hi. How are you?
115,00:04:48.67,00:04:48.67,I'm fine.
116,00:04:49.80,00:04:49.80, Nice to see you.
117,00:04:49.80,00:04:49.80,Nice to see you.
118,00:04:51.53,00:04:51.53,"   What's going on, man?"
119,00:04:52.90,00:04:52.90,How do you feel?
120,00:04:54.40,00:04:54.40," Good. How about you?  Nice to see you, man."
121,00:04:55.60,00:04:55.60,You want a tour?
122,00:04:57.03,00:04:57.03,"   Yeah, let me have a tour. Take me around."
123,00:05:02.93,00:05:02.93,"Hi, Sue. How are you?"
124,00:05:04.40,00:05:04.40,Good.
125,00:05:05.40,00:05:05.40, The sun's out. Beautiful...
126,00:05:07.30,00:05:07.30,"Stingray, cuttlefish and lobster for lunch."
127,00:05:09.60,00:05:09.60, ( squeals )
128,00:05:11.07,00:05:11.07,   We're having rock lobster    for lunch.
129,00:05:12.73,00:05:12.73,"Oh, my God."
130,00:05:12.73,00:05:12.73," Hey, Kel, check out  the cuttlefish."
131,00:05:15.23,00:05:15.23,"  Nice, nice. Deluxe."
132,00:05:16.57,00:05:16.57,"Oh, yeah."
133,00:05:16.57,00:05:16.57,With a working lid and everything.
134,00:05:18.40,00:05:18.40,Wi-with lid. Uh-huh.
135,00:05:19.40,00:05:19.40,How often do you guys move that?
136,00:05:21.73,00:05:21.73,Never?
137,00:05:21.73,00:05:21.73,   Never.
138,00:05:22.90,00:05:22.90,"  This is, uh,    chef Rudy."
139,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90,Check out the kitchen.
140,00:05:25.17,00:05:25.17,"Chef Rudy, um, can I go in your kitchen?"
141,00:05:26.73,00:05:26.73,"Oh, yeah."
142,00:05:26.73,00:05:26.73,Okay.
143,00:05:27.73,00:05:27.73, Wipe your feet.
144,00:05:29.40,00:05:29.40,"  ""Rowdy Rudy's Diner"""
145,00:05:31.37,00:05:31.37,"This is where we keep spices, toilet paper, candles..."
146,00:05:35.97,00:05:35.97,fruit peels go in there.
147,00:05:37.57,00:05:37.57,Nice.
148,00:05:38.77,00:05:38.77,"But, uh..."
149,00:05:38.77,00:05:38.77,This is so nice.
150,00:05:40.13,00:05:40.13,RICHARD:    Isn't that a cool kitchen?
151,00:05:41.70,00:05:41.70,"So, see, now, these are our kitchen hammocks."
152,00:05:41.70,00:05:41.70, Damn!
153,00:05:44.40,00:05:44.40,"  Oh, yeah, sleep five   really comfortable."
154,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,"Ours is about the same size,"
155,00:05:47.83,00:05:47.83,but it's lifted a little higher in the back.
156,00:05:50.57,00:05:50.57,"  And, uh, right   now, we've just..."
157,00:05:52.23,00:05:52.23,  we got two   mosquito nets.
158,00:05:53.60,00:05:53.60, The guys go  on the left
159,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,"  and me and Sue and   Rich, the girls,   go on the right."
160,00:05:57.57,00:05:57.57,Go ahead and pull out...
161,00:05:58.57,00:05:58.57,"Yeah, we have this thing..."
162,00:05:59.87,00:05:59.87,"If you want, I'll diagram what we got."
163,00:06:01.97,00:06:01.97,   Nice.
164,00:06:03.33,00:06:03.33,"   Super bench,    living room area."
165,00:06:05.13,00:06:05.13,"  Oh, my God,   you guys are"
166,00:06:06.30,00:06:06.30,"very, very well-organized."
167,00:06:07.93,00:06:07.93,( laughing )
168,00:06:08.93,00:06:08.93,So much more than ours.
169,00:06:11.00,00:06:11.00,  Have a seat.
170,00:06:16.87,00:06:16.87,"Hey, not too bad."
171,00:06:17.87,00:06:17.87,"We got plenty of this, too."
172,00:06:19.40,00:06:19.40,We don't eat that much of it.
173,00:06:21.07,00:06:21.07, No?
174,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,No. We have it.
175,00:06:23.13,00:06:23.13,We don't eat it.
176,00:06:24.60,00:06:24.60, GERVASE:  We live off  this stuff.
177,00:06:26.43,00:06:26.43,It's a lot of work for a little bit of sugar
178,00:06:28.67,00:06:28.67,"it seems to me, you know?"
179,00:06:30.00,00:06:30.00,   You guys are amazing.
180,00:06:31.60,00:06:31.60,  Like a well-   oiled machine.
181,00:06:33.60,00:06:33.60,The stingray looks wonderful.
182,00:06:35.40,00:06:35.40, KELLY:   Stingray is so good.
183,00:06:36.60,00:06:36.60,Stingray is incredible.
184,00:06:38.23,00:06:38.23,Does it grab you?
185,00:06:39.80,00:06:39.80, Whoa.
186,00:06:41.07,00:06:41.07,Is it funkified already?
187,00:06:45.83,00:06:45.83,Fermented?
188,00:06:47.30,00:06:47.30,That's not good.
189,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83,   Next.
190,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83, Number two.
191,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,"SUSAN: You know, you kind of get..."
192,00:06:51.67,00:06:51.67,"Ah, there's a lot of meat on that bad boy."
193,00:06:53.87,00:06:53.87,"Yeah, just try that."
194,00:06:55.03,00:06:55.03,SUSAN: Yeah.
195,00:06:58.97,00:06:58.97,"Oh, my God."
196,00:06:59.97,00:06:59.97,SUSAN: Isn't it good?
197,00:07:01.57,00:07:01.57,It's delicious.
198,00:07:04.60,00:07:04.60,"I don't need anymore, you know."
199,00:07:06.80,00:07:06.80,You know...
200,00:07:08.43,00:07:08.43,"   I mean, uh..."
201,00:07:09.67,00:07:09.67,"Right off, just chew on the cuttlebone."
202,00:07:11.80,00:07:11.80,"Hey, you know..."
203,00:07:13.13,00:07:13.13,   RICHARD: It's calamari.
204,00:07:14.60,00:07:14.60,  It's going to be     just like squid.
205,00:07:15.60,00:07:15.60,  It's the exact same thing.
206,00:07:16.67,00:07:16.67," If you've had fried calamari,"
207,00:07:18.30,00:07:18.30,"  well, we're having roasted. That's awesome."
208,00:07:19.93,00:07:19.93,Here.
209,00:07:21.93,00:07:21.93,"RICHARD:   That lobster, it's so sweet."
210,00:07:24.53,00:07:24.53,   This is delicious.
211,00:07:25.53,00:07:25.53,( laughing )
212,00:07:27.40,00:07:27.40,  That's what we   want you to say   when you get home.
213,00:07:29.13,00:07:29.13,  Just tell them
214,00:07:30.33,00:07:30.33,  how good   everything is.
215,00:07:31.60,00:07:31.60," Food, golden."
216,00:07:34.87,00:07:34.87," Yeah, when we merge tonight,  I think it'll be interesting."
217,00:07:37.50,00:07:37.50,"   I think, uh, it'll set up    a whole nother set"
218,00:07:41.13,00:07:41.13,   of interpersonal dynamics that'll be fun for me to watch.
219,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,"Tell us more, uh, like,  rumors you've heard about us,"
220,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13,  or things you think you know   about us...
221,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13, Okay.
222,00:07:47.90,00:07:47.90,  or what do you want to know    about us?
223,00:07:49.53,00:07:49.53,"   All right, um, let's see--    ""rumors that I've heard""--"
224,00:07:51.97,00:07:51.97,   that you guys are plotting    an alliance against us...
225,00:07:54.37,00:07:54.37,   divide and conquer  sort of thing.
226,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,Really?
227,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,  That's the big one.
228,00:07:57.07,00:07:57.07,  The alliance  that we have going on
229,00:07:58.47,00:07:58.47,"  is Rich, Rudy, Kelly and me."
230,00:08:01.50,00:08:01.50," We'll vote four people strong,"
231,00:08:03.07,00:08:03.07," and if we can make it   through the first two votes,"
232,00:08:05.23,00:08:05.23,  getting somebody     off of their team off...
233,00:08:06.93,00:08:06.93,  ( chuckles )
234,00:08:08.23,00:08:08.23,   we should be able to slide into home plate.
235,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,That's what we said.
236,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,"   Yeah, you only get..."
237,00:08:12.50,00:08:12.50,   We don't know any of you;    you don't know any of us.
238,00:08:14.47,00:08:14.47,"Exactly,    and I'm so excited"
239,00:08:15.50,00:08:15.50, to get to know five new people.
240,00:08:16.83,00:08:16.83,   ( laughing ):  So are we.
241,00:08:16.83,00:08:16.83,Cool.
242,00:08:17.83,00:08:17.83,Jenna's sincere.
243,00:08:19.03,00:08:19.03,She is sincere.
244,00:08:19.03,00:08:19.03,"I believe Jenna's sincere,"
245,00:08:20.17,00:08:20.17,"and I think Gretchen's sincere,"
246,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,"but Gren... Jenna is young, and not"
247,00:08:23.90,00:08:23.90,  a mature young   like you.
248,00:08:25.00,00:08:25.00,She's young.
249,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,Just babbling.
250,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,She's young flaky.
251,00:08:27.67,00:08:27.67, JENNA:  I wanted to come across  as a strong young mom
252,00:08:29.87,00:08:29.87,  'cause I think
253,00:08:30.87,00:08:30.87,they're often portrayed
254,00:08:31.87,00:08:31.87,"  as victims of circumstance,"
255,00:08:33.20,00:08:33.20,"   and, uh...  wanted to be a good role model"
256,00:08:36.10,00:08:36.10, for my girls when they see it   when they get older.
257,00:08:37.97,00:08:37.97, She wants to be proud    for her children.
258,00:08:39.20,00:08:39.20,   Proud for your children--   win.
259,00:08:40.87,00:08:40.87,   She's just really    happy to be here.
260,00:08:42.07,00:08:42.07,Show your girls what it's about and how to win.
261,00:08:44.90,00:08:44.90,"  Six days ago, I was 180 out,    but, uh, I seen the light."
262,00:08:48.30,00:08:48.30,  It's... ( chuckles )
263,00:08:49.77,00:08:49.77," If you want to win this money,  you got to get a little dirty."
264,00:08:52.90,00:08:52.90,"You know, who's next, don't you?"
265,00:08:54.27,00:08:54.27,"I don't need to deal with that. Who, after Greg?"
266,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,Jenna.
267,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,Jenna.
268,00:08:57.33,00:08:57.33,I was thinking Sean.
269,00:08:58.33,00:08:58.33,"   Oh, yeah."
270,00:08:59.33,00:08:59.33,He's too much competition
271,00:09:00.67,00:09:00.67,and he will not participate.
272,00:09:02.23,00:09:02.23, The reason Sean's not in the alliance
273,00:09:06.30,00:09:06.30,   because... Sean...
274,00:09:08.20,00:09:08.20,is dumb.
275,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00," So, Sean, are they,  uh, planning on  banding together"
276,00:09:12.40,00:09:12.40, and picking us  off one by one?
277,00:09:13.93,00:09:13.93,"SEAN: I think they've changed their minds, you know, because"
278,00:09:16.53,00:09:16.53,"I think they have very nice, warm"
279,00:09:17.97,00:09:17.97,touchy feelings towards you guys.
280,00:09:19.60,00:09:19.60,Sean's ethically against   any kind of alliance
281,00:09:22.70,00:09:22.70, and I hear Gretchen is similar    on the other side
282,00:09:25.93,00:09:25.93,"   and, um... I don't get it."
283,00:09:27.63,00:09:27.63," You know, I-I consider myself"
284,00:09:29.97,00:09:29.97,extraordinarily ethical    and moral
285,00:09:32.10,00:09:32.10,"  and, uh, this has"
286,00:09:33.47,00:09:33.47,  absolutely nothing to do    with this.
287,00:09:35.30,00:09:35.30,"  Uh, it sounds like   sheer stupidity to me"
288,00:09:37.47,00:09:37.47,  when somebody says
289,00:09:38.90,00:09:38.90," ""Oh, no, I'm not going  to build an alliance,"
290,00:09:41.00,00:09:41.00,"  and I hope they wouldn't     do that either."""
291,00:09:43.37,00:09:43.37," Uh, you know, I giggle    and think, ""okay."""
292,00:09:46.10,00:09:46.10,  ( laughing )
293,00:09:47.60,00:09:47.60,"   God, I'm glad I'm    on your team."
294,00:09:48.60,00:09:48.60,"Yeah, baby."
295,00:09:50.23,00:09:50.23,Didn't come here to...
296,00:09:52.00,00:09:52.00,make friends.
297,00:09:55.70,00:09:55.70,  I got to lug one of you guys?
298,00:09:59.13,00:09:59.13,GERVASE:  Sean's cool.    Sean's a nice guy.
299,00:10:02.83,00:10:02.83,"He had a lot of stories to tell, and..."
300,00:10:04.87,00:10:04.87,"   I mean, he... he was just,  like, a genuine, honest guy--"
301,00:10:07.83,00:10:07.83,"you know, what he said, you just believed what he said."
302,00:10:10.90,00:10:10.90,  You can just tell    he wants to have some fun.
303,00:10:13.53,00:10:13.53," He hasn't had fun yet,     so, uh..."
304,00:10:15.17,00:10:15.17,we'll bring lots of fun his way.
305,00:10:16.80,00:10:16.80,  We'll keep him entertained.
306,00:10:18.23,00:10:18.23,( both talking at once )
307,00:10:19.60,00:10:19.60,I will.
308,00:10:21.17,00:10:21.17," Bye, Rich. Bye, Rudy."
309,00:10:23.13,00:10:23.13, RUDY:    Jenna and Sean are going   to have a good time talking.
310,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13, I don't know which one talks the most.
311,00:10:28.47,00:10:28.47,   She ain't shut up  since she's been here.
312,00:10:37.63,00:10:37.63,"Bye, guys."
313,00:10:38.77,00:10:38.77,"Bye, girl."
314,00:10:40.03,00:10:40.03,"Bye, Sean!"
315,00:11:04.93,00:11:04.93," JEFF:  Welcome, Jenna."
316,00:11:06.90,00:11:06.90,A chair just for you.
317,00:11:09.10,00:11:09.10,Welcome.
318,00:11:09.10,00:11:09.10,And look at me-- I didn't dress for dinner.
319,00:11:11.07,00:11:11.07,How you doing? Nice to see you.
320,00:11:11.07,00:11:11.07,Nice to see you.
321,00:11:13.40,00:11:13.40,  One chair for you.
322,00:11:13.40,00:11:13.40, Hello. How are you?
323,00:11:14.93,00:11:14.93,"Wow, we're off to a good start."
324,00:11:16.37,00:11:16.37,A little kiss-- I like that.
325,00:11:16.37,00:11:16.37,Pretty cool.
326,00:11:18.50,00:11:18.50," Well, here's the deal:"
327,00:11:19.97,00:11:19.97,You guys are ambassadors for your tribes.
328,00:11:22.27,00:11:22.27, You have a very important task tonight.
329,00:11:24.90,00:11:24.90,"  We wanted you to   feel like ambassadors,   so we've prepared"
330,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03," some lobster,   you have some bread,"
331,00:11:30.10,00:11:30.10,"baked potatoes,"
332,00:11:31.43,00:11:31.43," butter for the lobster,"
333,00:11:33.43,00:11:33.43,"   uh, lemon-- I don't think"
334,00:11:35.63,00:11:35.63,  we missed anything   except for the wine
335,00:11:37.27,00:11:37.27, which is being chilled    right now.
336,00:11:38.47,00:11:38.47,What I need in the morning is
337,00:11:40.30,00:11:40.30,"   on this parchment, with    a couple of pens in here,"
338,00:11:41.70,00:11:41.70,  to have the new name of the tribe...
339,00:11:44.97,00:11:44.97,"   which camp  you're going to be at,"
340,00:11:46.67,00:11:46.67,  and the three items  you're taking.
341,00:11:48.30,00:11:48.30,You'll be given one new color for this new tribe--
342,00:11:51.03,00:11:51.03,   green-- yellow and    orange no longer used
343,00:11:52.83,00:11:52.83,   to represent opposing tribes.
344,00:11:54.33,00:11:54.33,You are now one.
345,00:11:55.37,00:11:55.37,There's also stuff
346,00:11:56.43,00:11:56.43,to make two new flags for camp.
347,00:11:58.47,00:11:58.47,"There are paintbrushes, paints,"
348,00:12:00.60,00:12:00.60,"so once you decide on the name,   you can go to town on that."
349,00:12:04.43,00:12:04.43,   Can we eat first?
350,00:12:05.67,00:12:05.67, You can do...   you have all night.
351,00:12:07.13,00:12:07.13," As you can see... right here,    we have two beds."
352,00:12:09.40,00:12:09.40,( laughing )
353,00:12:09.40,00:12:09.40,"Oh, my God."
354,00:12:10.50,00:12:10.50,So we are definitely staying here tonight?
355,00:12:12.43,00:12:12.43, You are here all night.
356,00:12:14.20,00:12:14.20,"   Jenna, how stylin' are we!"
357,00:12:28.77,00:12:28.77,  I immediately saw the table  set up with...
358,00:12:30.90,00:12:30.90, it was like a romantic dinner.
359,00:12:32.57,00:12:32.57," It was like this table all set   up with everything, two beds"
360,00:12:35.27,00:12:35.27,  off to the right
361,00:12:36.70,00:12:36.70," single, like,    really nice sheets"
362,00:12:39.27,00:12:39.27,"   and pillows and blankets,    and, uh..."
363,00:12:40.63,00:12:40.63," like, a stump,"
364,00:12:41.97,00:12:41.97," we had a bedside table,"
365,00:12:43.40,00:12:43.40,"  we had lanterns everywhere,   tiki torches,"
366,00:12:45.17,00:12:45.17,  and the first thing     I thought was...
367,00:12:46.90,00:12:46.90,"   ""Oh, man,    they're so setting this up"
368,00:12:48.50,00:12:48.50,"for it to be romantic with Sean"""
369,00:12:50.50,00:12:50.50,  and there's just...    there's not a spark there.
370,00:12:52.70,00:12:52.70,"Making out's, I think, first base;"
371,00:12:54.60,00:12:54.60,"second base, up the shirt;"
372,00:12:55.90,00:12:55.90,third base...
373,00:12:55.90,00:12:55.90,"Okay, okay."
374,00:12:57.60,00:12:57.60,  But I often give a bad first  impression sometimes.
375,00:13:00.60,00:13:00.60,You never heard of bases like that?
376,00:13:02.33,00:13:02.33,  I always just knew   what the home run was.
377,00:13:04.10,00:13:04.10, I'm all about the goal.
378,00:13:05.23,00:13:05.23,  I'm goal-oriented.
379,00:13:06.23,00:13:06.23,Sliding into home plate
380,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,here's Jenna.
381,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,Okay.
382,00:13:10.07,00:13:10.07,  They wanted it to be  more romantic
383,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50," than it was ever going to be,    but, uh..."
384,00:13:13.30,00:13:13.30," from either end of us,     but we really had"
385,00:13:15.33,00:13:15.33," an exceptional time,   and we tied one on, you know,"
386,00:13:19.13,00:13:19.13,"uh, finished the bottles of wine,"
387,00:13:20.87,00:13:20.87,"and we ate like    kings and queens,"
388,00:13:22.37,00:13:22.37,"   and, uh, it was fantastic."
389,00:13:23.80,00:13:23.80,"Uh, we saw Pagong's fire  was still lit"
390,00:13:25.73,00:13:25.73," so I was like,    ""Oh, I want to call home."
391,00:13:27.67,00:13:27.67,"   They're probably worried."""
392,00:13:29.07,00:13:29.07,"  And, uh, so we threw a bunch of kerosene on our fire"
393,00:13:31.57,00:13:31.57,"   to make it whoosh,"
394,00:13:32.80,00:13:32.80," and they said they saw that,"
395,00:13:34.43,00:13:34.43,  so I hoped  that they would figure
396,00:13:36.23,00:13:36.23," that I was still there,     that I was okay."
397,00:13:38.17,00:13:38.17,Whoa. Fire on the spit.
398,00:13:40.90,00:13:40.90,It seems so far away from the island.
399,00:13:44.03,00:13:44.03, GREG:   They had to have fed Jenna.
400,00:13:46.83,00:13:46.83,"I mean, the summit going from 4:00 in the afternoon"
401,00:13:50.10,00:13:50.10,  until... well after dark...
402,00:13:52.13,00:13:52.13, Yeah. They're not going  to let her starve.
403,00:13:54.17,00:13:54.17,With one lunch.
404,00:13:55.60,00:13:55.60,"  Well, Gervase can save hers  in case... his"
405,00:13:58.17,00:13:58.17,  in case she... wants to see  what it would have been like.
406,00:14:05.40,00:14:05.40, JENNA:  We talked all night.
407,00:14:07.83,00:14:07.83, It helped that they had    four bottles of wine there.
408,00:14:10.73,00:14:10.73, So we drank them all
409,00:14:12.33,00:14:12.33," and, uh, we were both  pretty drunk."
410,00:14:14.63,00:14:14.63,"   And... it's raining,    and we're inside now."
411,00:14:16.83,00:14:16.83,We just made it.
412,00:14:16.83,00:14:16.83,We're completely covered.
413,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,We had a great meal.
414,00:14:21.43,00:14:21.43,"Me, I'm exhausted from all this wine."
415,00:14:25.20,00:14:25.20,   Do you want to go to bed?
416,00:14:57.10,00:14:57.10,   GRETCHEN:   We're just waiting     'cause no one's given us
417,00:14:59.53,00:14:59.53,  any information.
418,00:15:00.70,00:15:00.70," So, I mean, last night"
419,00:15:02.23,00:15:02.23,we were wondering where she was.
420,00:15:03.83,00:15:03.83," And then somebody said    ""Well, she can't come back"
421,00:15:05.23,00:15:05.23," until the negotiations    are over."""
422,00:15:06.57,00:15:06.57,  But there's really nothing   to negotiate.
423,00:15:07.63,00:15:07.63, We could have made a shelter
424,00:15:09.07,00:15:09.07, in that time.   We could have made--
425,00:15:10.70,00:15:10.70,"  whatever they're     negotiating for,"
426,00:15:11.90,00:15:11.90,  we could have moved our whole camp--
427,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,been done in that time.
428,00:15:14.57,00:15:14.57," So I don't, I don't know what   the whole process is about."
429,00:15:15.90,00:15:15.90, We miss Jenna.
430,00:15:17.00,00:15:17.00,  We haven't seen Jenna at all
431,00:15:19.33,00:15:19.33,"  since she's left,"
432,00:15:20.80,00:15:20.80,  and we were kind of worried   about her last night
433,00:15:23.03,00:15:23.03,when it got dark   and she wasn't here.
434,00:15:24.77,00:15:24.77, GREG:  I'd be wasting    my time and energy
435,00:15:27.43,00:15:27.43,"to, uh, guess what's happening."
436,00:15:29.57,00:15:29.57,So I don't even bother.
437,00:15:30.90,00:15:30.90,What's going on?
438,00:15:32.00,00:15:32.00, It's a beautiful day.
439,00:15:33.20,00:15:33.20,The sun's nice.
440,00:15:34.30,00:15:34.30,   You can see Mount Kinabalu
441,00:15:35.80,00:15:35.80,"and, uh,    we're going to go fishing."
442,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,   RUDY:    That's a big one.
443,00:15:39.07,00:15:39.07,"RICHARD: Yeah, he's a good fatty."
444,00:15:41.27,00:15:41.27,That's a lot of meat.
445,00:15:43.27,00:15:43.27,"  They talked about some kind    of a negotiation,"
446,00:15:46.20,00:15:46.20, and I would imagine if the two    parties had opposing views
447,00:15:50.40,00:15:50.40,as to what camp   they should move to
448,00:15:52.80,00:15:52.80, that the negotiation   might go on--
449,00:15:54.97,00:15:54.97,  or might be interesting.
450,00:15:56.53,00:15:56.53," But since both parties,"
451,00:15:58.07,00:15:58.07,"  as far as we know,    want to move to this camp,"
452,00:16:01.50,00:16:01.50,I can't imagine what's going on    on the sand spit.
453,00:16:03.97,00:16:03.97," SUSAN:   We're not sure yet,    because Sean has been gone"
454,00:16:06.13,00:16:06.13,  almost 24 hours now   since we sent him off
455,00:16:08.23,00:16:08.23, on the messenger thing.
456,00:16:10.97,00:16:10.97,  So the anticipation   of waiting for Sean
457,00:16:13.93,00:16:13.93,   is just actually starting    to drive us wild.
458,00:16:44.70,00:16:44.70," Oh, my God!"
459,00:16:46.23,00:16:46.23,   I have so much    to tell you guys.
460,00:16:56.07,00:16:56.07,First things first--
461,00:16:57.77,00:16:57.77,  we are moving.
462,00:16:59.07,00:16:59.07,We have five minutes from when we banked
463,00:17:01.67,00:17:01.67,to get everything in your backpacks--
464,00:17:03.90,00:17:03.90,to get your luxury item.
465,00:17:05.60,00:17:05.60,   Only what you brought    in your backpacks
466,00:17:07.47,00:17:07.47,   and luxury item--
467,00:17:08.77,00:17:08.77,"  and three objects,   which we chose,"
468,00:17:10.13,00:17:10.13,  and we're out of here.
469,00:17:11.57,00:17:11.57,   And we told Pagong   the unfortunate news
470,00:17:13.63,00:17:13.63,   that they had five minutes  to pack their things--
471,00:17:16.50,00:17:16.50, get their luxury item and choose three items.
472,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10," Which we decided were the wool  blanket that they have,"
473,00:17:21.50,00:17:21.50," the mosquito netting,"
474,00:17:22.73,00:17:22.73,  so we could sleep
475,00:17:24.27,00:17:24.27,"  under the mosquito netting,"
476,00:17:26.17,00:17:26.17,"  and the, um, cooking pot."
477,00:17:27.57,00:17:27.57,"We were given a luxury dinner,"
478,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,but we had to decide a new name
479,00:17:31.60,00:17:31.60,"and we had to paint the new flag,"
480,00:17:33.90,00:17:33.90,  and we had to pick   a location--
481,00:17:35.93,00:17:35.93,she liked our camp a lot.
482,00:17:37.47,00:17:37.47,  You guys will love it.
483,00:17:38.87,00:17:38.87,"Actually, Sean let me do   almost all of the deciding."
484,00:17:41.00,00:17:41.00,"I came up with the name,   he added an ""a"" on the end."
485,00:17:43.27,00:17:43.27,  Jenna came up with the name.
486,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17, It had to be something that   was indigenous to the island
487,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13," and, you know, we have a lot   of rattan wood here."
488,00:17:50.57,00:17:50.57,"  And we just added an ""a"""
489,00:17:51.70,00:17:51.70, to make it sound more exotic.
490,00:17:53.20,00:17:53.20,   That was my idea.
491,00:17:54.63,00:17:54.63,"   You know, give it a little flair, a little pizzazz."
492,00:17:56.90,00:17:56.90,"   JENNA:    As we were dining    on lobster and, um..."
493,00:17:58.33,00:17:58.33, baked potatoes.
494,00:18:00.50,00:18:00.50,SEAN: Dessert.
495,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,JENNA: Four bottles of wine.
496,00:18:02.87,00:18:02.87,SEAN: Four bottles of wine. Four bottles of wine.
497,00:18:05.20,00:18:05.20,   A hangover in the morning.
498,00:18:06.20,00:18:06.20,"A hangover, a bed..."
499,00:18:06.20,00:18:06.20,"Beds, a tent."
500,00:18:07.70,00:18:07.70," GREG:    You know, they come back"
501,00:18:09.00,00:18:09.00,  having had a great night
502,00:18:10.30,00:18:10.30," and ""oh, my God, I can't wait to tell you guys"
503,00:18:12.60,00:18:12.60," how much we've eaten."""
504,00:18:13.77,00:18:13.77, And that's wonderful.
505,00:18:15.23,00:18:15.23, That's how ambassadors    should be treated.
506,00:18:16.93,00:18:16.93,"   But, you know, of course,    when you're on an island"
507,00:18:19.50,00:18:19.50,surviving on white rice    and the occasional fish...
508,00:18:22.13,00:18:22.13, SEAN:  Four croissants   with orange marmalade
509,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,  and strawberry jam.
510,00:18:25.67,00:18:25.67,Coffee... four bottles.
511,00:18:27.77,00:18:27.77,"   Hey, tell me a little bit  more about it."
512,00:18:29.50,00:18:29.50,I'd love to hear   about butter sauce.
513,00:18:30.93,00:18:30.93,Like... thanks.
514,00:18:33.97,00:18:33.97,"GERVASE:  I mean,     it just makes more sense"
515,00:18:35.73,00:18:35.73, to go to their side.
516,00:18:37.37,00:18:37.37,"  I mean, I think that's what  everybody wanted to do anyway."
517,00:18:39.27,00:18:39.27,  Everybody wanted to get out of this section
518,00:18:40.73,00:18:40.73, just for a new change    of scenery.
519,00:18:42.60,00:18:42.60, We've been here for 20 days.
520,00:18:44.80,00:18:44.80,  We've seen it. We know it.
521,00:18:46.23,00:18:46.23," So it was just like,"
522,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,"   you know, let's try something new."
523,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,COLLEEN:  Sean was even saying there's enough room for us in the hutch
524,00:18:52.07,00:18:52.07," because enough people   sleep outside, so..."
525,00:18:53.80,00:18:53.80, It's going to go quick.
526,00:18:55.90,00:18:55.90," God, I hope it goes quick from  here on out, you know. Really."
527,00:18:59.07,00:18:59.07," When I first got here,  I... you know,"
528,00:19:00.63,00:19:00.63,I think maybe I would have been more comfortable
529,00:19:04.47,00:19:04.47,"   on the other team,   because I, you know,"
530,00:19:05.90,00:19:05.90,"from what I understand, they pulled their camp together,"
531,00:19:08.77,00:19:08.77,"  they got their stuff   hanging up,"
532,00:19:10.33,00:19:10.33,"   which is, like, something    that's been bothering me"
533,00:19:12.40,00:19:12.40,"   since the day we got here,  and..."
534,00:19:13.80,00:19:13.80, but I think it was good for me  to be with this tribe
535,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,"  because, um, you don't have   to work all the time"
536,00:19:19.80,00:19:19.80,  and you don't have    to be busting butt.
537,00:19:21.33,00:19:21.33," It's nice... you know,"
538,00:19:22.33,00:19:22.33, we're healthy and we're happy
539,00:19:24.43,00:19:24.43,  and we spend a lot    of time having fun.
540,00:19:26.43,00:19:26.43," So I think it taught    me something, too."
541,00:19:28.43,00:19:28.43,  You can be very comfortable
542,00:19:31.03,00:19:31.03,"  and I don't feel like I need    to bust butt all the time,"
543,00:19:33.53,00:19:33.53,and I've had a good time while I'm here.
544,00:19:35.40,00:19:35.40, So I'll be glad to go  with the other tribe
545,00:19:37.47,00:19:37.47,  and I was glad to be with this tribe.
546,00:20:06.53,00:20:06.53, GREG:    It's like starting over.
547,00:20:08.77,00:20:08.77,  We've left behind
548,00:20:10.23,00:20:10.23,  a lot of things--  a lot of material possessions.
549,00:20:12.90,00:20:12.90,"  Metaphysically, we've also    left behind"
550,00:20:14.57,00:20:14.57,  a lot of emotional issues.
551,00:20:16.33,00:20:16.33,  Um... there was     a lot of baggage
552,00:20:19.50,00:20:19.50,that we left on that...  on that Pagong Beach.
553,00:20:23.57,00:20:23.57,"  But, uh..."
554,00:20:26.03,00:20:26.03,we're moving on   to bigger and better things.
555,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47,  I'm excited.
556,00:20:30.03,00:20:30.03,  I did feel sadness   when we left Pagong.
557,00:20:31.93,00:20:31.93," Looking back, that was where"
558,00:20:33.70,00:20:33.70,   we rode to the first day    when we were shipwrecked.
559,00:20:36.07,00:20:36.07, It was where I'd formed a bond  with eight...
560,00:20:38.30,00:20:38.30,"   seven other people, so..."
561,00:20:39.30,00:20:39.30,  it was sad.
562,00:20:40.83,00:20:40.83,  But it was a new beginning  for me-- a whole nother tribe.
563,00:20:43.00,00:20:43.00, Are we close to Tagi?
564,00:20:45.27,00:20:45.27,I don't think that's what it's called anymore.
565,00:20:48.27,00:20:48.27,   It's Rattana.
566,00:20:49.30,00:20:49.30,( laughing and talking )
567,00:20:53.63,00:20:53.63,"  Come on, left side."
568,00:20:55.83,00:20:55.83," Come on, left side."
569,00:21:03.90,00:21:03.90,"God, it's beautiful."
570,00:21:06.73,00:21:06.73," Yeah, it really is."
571,00:21:08.43,00:21:08.43,"COLLEEN:    So Rich came out,    it was like"
572,00:21:10.40,00:21:10.40,"  ""Hey, how are you?"""
573,00:21:11.73,00:21:11.73," You know, he swam out,  which was really nice."
574,00:21:13.63,00:21:13.63,They welcomed us with open arms.
575,00:21:15.43,00:21:15.43,  We got along really well.
576,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,Welcome.
577,00:21:18.70,00:21:18.70,Ooh!
578,00:21:26.67,00:21:26.67," So, what they   were really doing was coming"
579,00:21:28.53,00:21:28.53," to the beach  and, uh, were moving in"
580,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,  with what things they could have gotten together
581,00:21:32.60,00:21:32.60,  in the five minutes   that they had
582,00:21:33.90,00:21:33.90,"  to get together, I guess."
583,00:21:35.00,00:21:35.00,I was glad to see that.
584,00:21:36.60,00:21:36.60,Hi. Nice to see you again.
585,00:21:37.83,00:21:37.83,"Can I get a hug, all right?"
586,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17," You, too, handsome."
587,00:21:40.17,00:21:40.17,Were you guys worried about me?
588,00:21:42.17,00:21:42.17,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
589,00:21:46.53,00:21:46.53,Clothesline.
590,00:21:48.47,00:21:48.47,  House.
591,00:21:49.83,00:21:49.83,Living room.
592,00:21:50.90,00:21:50.90,Kitchen.
593,00:21:51.97,00:21:51.97,   Bathroom.
594,00:21:52.97,00:21:52.97,"Oh, my."
595,00:21:54.10,00:21:54.10,   The house ain't done yet.
596,00:21:55.37,00:21:55.37," We can't tour    the house yet, no."
597,00:21:57.37,00:21:57.37, GREG:    A boy named Sue.
598,00:21:58.40,00:21:58.40,"  Strong, loud, with an accent"
599,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,   that'll drive you  up the wall!
600,00:22:02.77,00:22:02.77,Was he talking about me?
601,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,Yeah.
602,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,"Oh, yeah."
603,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,"  Oh, come on!"
604,00:22:06.17,00:22:06.17,I'm up.
605,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,Remind me to do it.
606,00:22:08.73,00:22:08.73,"Yeah, you had a good one."
607,00:22:10.17,00:22:10.17,This thing's about 300 years old.
608,00:22:12.23,00:22:12.23," I think Rudy's  very set in his ways,"
609,00:22:14.10,00:22:14.10,"  so having, you know,"
610,00:22:15.57,00:22:15.57,"  five new people move in,   it scared him a lot,"
611,00:22:17.30,00:22:17.30,  so he was just sitting back
612,00:22:18.77,00:22:18.77," and he was assessing  the situation, I think."
613,00:22:20.97,00:22:20.97,"All of a sudden,    we doubled our population."
614,00:22:23.77,00:22:23.77,"  Uh, the house got smaller,"
615,00:22:25.80,00:22:25.80," the pots got smaller,"
616,00:22:28.40,00:22:28.40,"  and, uh..."
617,00:22:30.67,00:22:30.67,"  personally, it's a pain in the ass."
618,00:22:32.90,00:22:32.90,"New people, new scene..."
619,00:22:35.17,00:22:35.17,"new things to talk about, you know."
620,00:22:37.90,00:22:37.90,( general conversation )
621,00:22:40.23,00:22:40.23, KELLY:  It's almost too good.
622,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,"  Like, everybody's too..."
623,00:22:43.27,00:22:43.27,"  ""Oh, you go first."""
624,00:22:44.77,00:22:44.77,"  ""No, you go first,""    oh, you know, everybody's"
625,00:22:46.97,00:22:46.97," being real, real super polite,     you know, which is cool."
626,00:22:49.80,00:22:49.80,COLLEEN:    Sean is very intelligent.
627,00:22:52.07,00:22:52.07,  Sometimes he says    interesting things.
628,00:22:53.87,00:22:53.87, Sometimes you tune out
629,00:22:55.23,00:22:55.23,"  for a while,  and then he hits on something"
630,00:22:56.87,00:22:56.87," so you tune back in, you know."
631,00:22:58.33,00:22:58.33,"   I mean, he's always going."
632,00:22:59.40,00:22:59.40,"SEAN: Girls always rank ""sense of humor"""
633,00:23:01.17,00:23:01.17," then, like, ""ambition""  and then all this other stuff"
634,00:23:03.33,00:23:03.33," and then rank ""looks,""    like, number five or six."
635,00:23:05.13,00:23:05.13,"But meanwhile, I know so many unambitious,"
636,00:23:07.67,00:23:07.67,"good-looking guys,"
637,00:23:08.73,00:23:08.73,"who have absolutely no personality,"
638,00:23:10.57,00:23:10.57,that still get a lot of girls.
639,00:23:12.47,00:23:12.47,I'm really going to get skinny.
640,00:23:14.50,00:23:14.50,  I got to go back   in the water. Bye.
641,00:23:16.60,00:23:16.60," GREG:  Rich is clever     and, uh... I mean"
642,00:23:18.63,00:23:18.63, we'll start being honest now.
643,00:23:20.50,00:23:20.50,  I think Rich thinks    he's very clever.
644,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17," He is, uh, relatively sharp,    and, uh..."
645,00:23:25.60,00:23:25.60,"he has a lot of things going on    in his mind that he, uh..."
646,00:23:29.50,00:23:29.50,"  selectively decides, uh,    what he will share"
647,00:23:32.83,00:23:32.83, and with whom.
648,00:23:33.97,00:23:33.97,"  Rich is playing a big game,"
649,00:23:36.17,00:23:36.17,"   which is very fun,  so he's awfully entertaining."
650,00:23:39.23,00:23:39.23, KELLY:   That... it was suggested...
651,00:23:42.60,00:23:42.60,"   that we should, you know,"
652,00:23:43.97,00:23:43.97," ""beef up"" the supports and everything."
653,00:23:46.10,00:23:46.10," Okay, which, you know,   I don't know"
654,00:23:48.23,00:23:48.23," I don't know anything    about shingles and roofing,"
655,00:23:50.93,00:23:50.93,"and I just know    how to tie knots,"
656,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,   that's pretty much  all I know how to do.
657,00:24:04.20,00:24:04.20,Okay.
658,00:24:05.57,00:24:05.57,  It ain't going   nowhere.
659,00:24:08.90,00:24:08.90,You might want to tie this.
660,00:24:11.77,00:24:11.77,  Ow!
661,00:24:13.23,00:24:13.23,Up and down.
662,00:24:14.37,00:24:14.37,   ( loud crashing )
663,00:24:16.83,00:24:16.83,That doesn't sound good.
664,00:24:18.60,00:24:18.60,"   Oh, yeah."
665,00:24:19.60,00:24:19.60,( hearty laughter )
666,00:24:21.10,00:24:21.10,I didn't touch it.
667,00:24:21.10,00:24:21.10,"Oh, my God!"
668,00:24:22.90,00:24:22.90,That did not just happen.
669,00:24:25.47,00:24:25.47,"  Oh, my God."
670,00:24:26.70,00:24:26.70,"   And, bam, shingles break,"
671,00:24:28.97,00:24:28.97, the whole roof   comes crashing down.
672,00:24:31.90,00:24:31.90,Felt like such an idiot.
673,00:24:33.60,00:24:33.60,It figures that the day that everyone shows up
674,00:24:35.57,00:24:35.57,the whole roof caves in   while they're repairing it.
675,00:24:37.90,00:24:37.90,"  Yeah, it's the same as it is    back home, ladies,"
676,00:24:40.50,00:24:40.50,  here in the jungle.
677,00:24:41.50,00:24:41.50,The women are doing all the work
678,00:24:43.77,00:24:43.77,  and the guys   are just hanging out
679,00:24:45.57,00:24:45.57,"  and b.s.'ing, yeah."
680,00:24:46.80,00:24:46.80,   It's my turn.
681,00:24:48.27,00:24:48.27,  I pick up   from here.
682,00:24:49.70,00:24:49.70,It's a hit.
683,00:24:50.83,00:24:50.83,I can hit you this card; you can't drop.
684,00:24:53.03,00:24:53.03,Every time you get hit
685,00:24:54.37,00:24:54.37,you have to stay around one more round.
686,00:25:01.13,00:25:01.13, ( gasping )
687,00:25:03.07,00:25:03.07,"Very good, Rich."
688,00:25:04.37,00:25:04.37,( chuckles )
689,00:25:06.07,00:25:06.07,"  The guys are kind of bumming around, but I think that's good"
690,00:25:08.50,00:25:08.50,  'cause I think all the guys  got to get to know each other.
691,00:25:10.93,00:25:10.93,RICHARD:  Isn't that beautiful?
692,00:25:12.80,00:25:12.80,Don't lie.
693,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,"It looks like mucus, doesn't it?"
694,00:25:17.03,00:25:17.03,"SUSAN: Oh, yeah."
695,00:25:18.17,00:25:18.17,Jammin'.
696,00:25:20.07,00:25:20.07,"You see it, Sue?"
697,00:25:21.23,00:25:21.23,   You see anything?
698,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,( laughing )
699,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73," It's how men and women relate,    you know."
700,00:25:25.50,00:25:25.50,  The women-- we work together
701,00:25:27.07,00:25:27.07,  and we... it's a little...     women are always
702,00:25:28.73,00:25:28.73,"  a little bit competitive  in everything we do, you know,"
703,00:25:30.83,00:25:30.83, so it's like   when you're working together
704,00:25:32.60,00:25:32.60, you're seeing   what the other person
705,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,"  can do, and you're proving   each other at the same time."
706,00:25:36.87,00:25:36.87,Men can sit down    and talk for hours
707,00:25:38.30,00:25:38.30, and walk away friends.
708,00:25:41.50,00:25:41.50,You got the hang of it now.
709,00:25:43.43,00:25:43.43,   ( hearty chuckle )
710,00:25:44.43,00:25:44.43,  Gervase was great.
711,00:25:45.60,00:25:45.60,   I beat the hell out of him
712,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,"  in a number of games  that I've never played before,"
713,00:25:49.77,00:25:49.77," and he's, uh,   he's good at cards."
714,00:25:52.10,00:25:52.10,   I think he could have been letting me win.
715,00:25:54.57,00:25:54.57," Uh, who knows?"
716,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80," He could be playing the odds,   too."
717,00:25:58.10,00:25:58.10,  It's natural to me.
718,00:25:59.50,00:25:59.50,"What I do, I don't think   I'm doing anything special."
719,00:26:01.93,00:26:01.93, I'm just being myself.
720,00:26:03.57,00:26:03.57,"  But other people always say,    like, ""You're a charmer."""
721,00:26:05.63,00:26:05.63,"   ""You're a smooth talker."""
722,00:26:07.10,00:26:07.10,"   Looking real good    there, Rich."
723,00:26:08.23,00:26:08.23,Thanks.
724,00:26:08.23,00:26:08.23,Real good there.
725,00:26:09.30,00:26:09.30,Can you tell I'm losing?
726,00:26:09.30,00:26:09.30,Yeah.
727,00:26:11.00,00:26:11.00,"That makes me happy, 'cause I can't tell."
728,00:26:15.50,00:26:15.50,   They don't...
729,00:26:16.50,00:26:16.50,they don't cook out enough.
730,00:26:17.77,00:26:17.77,They're... they're great for bait
731,00:26:19.87,00:26:19.87,   but their insides    is just nothing but guts.
732,00:26:22.10,00:26:22.10,Greg's an interesting character.
733,00:26:23.60,00:26:23.60,"He's young, too. He's 24,"
734,00:26:24.73,00:26:24.73,  and he was pretty cocky.
735,00:26:26.33,00:26:26.33,"He was thinking he could go out and get something, came back in"
736,00:26:29.57,00:26:29.57,   with a sea urchin.
737,00:26:30.57,00:26:30.57, ( derisive chuckling )
738,00:26:32.53,00:26:32.53,"   But that was good,    that shows people"
739,00:26:33.97,00:26:33.97,  that he who thought  he was a spear-fishing person
740,00:26:36.37,00:26:36.37,"  could go out there,    no problem,"
741,00:26:37.60,00:26:37.60,  comes from the other tribe
742,00:26:39.13,00:26:39.13,"  and came back in,     telling everybody"
743,00:26:40.70,00:26:40.70,   just how difficult it is--   that ups my value even more.
744,00:26:48.63,00:26:48.63," JENNA:  Free in sight, less than 100 feet away"
745,00:26:51.83,00:26:51.83,"  and we have, like..."
746,00:26:53.33,00:26:53.33,"I've got this girl laid out in,    like, across the back seat"
747,00:26:55.93,00:26:55.93,"  of, like, a Suzuki Sidekick  and it was, like, incredible."
748,00:26:59.27,00:26:59.27,Come on. Who can follow that?
749,00:27:03.27,00:27:03.27,Not I.
750,00:27:03.27,00:27:03.27,Rich.
751,00:27:05.30,00:27:05.30,Rich can.
752,00:27:05.30,00:27:05.30,"Rich, yay."
753,00:27:07.10,00:27:07.10,"First night as one tribe   we sat around the campfire,"
754,00:27:10.27,00:27:10.27,"told stories-- very, very, very    revealing stories."
755,00:27:13.27,00:27:13.27, KELLY: Gretchen said she drank a fifth     of whiskey in two minutes
756,00:27:18.33,00:27:18.33, when she was 14
757,00:27:19.93,00:27:19.93," and I would have never guessed    that about her, you know?"
758,00:27:23.13,00:27:23.13,  Sounds like we kind of have a similar past.
759,00:27:25.83,00:27:25.83,"This new group is, like,   it's like a banquet."
760,00:27:30.37,00:27:30.37, It's like a banquet of stories and excitement.
761,00:27:32.97,00:27:32.97,Sean left an orgy opportunity.
762,00:27:34.93,00:27:34.93,"No, I left a two-on-one opportunity. Two girls."
763,00:27:38.20,00:27:38.20,How come you left it?
764,00:27:39.43,00:27:39.43,I was scared out of my mind.
765,00:27:41.43,00:27:41.43, RUDY:   Some of the stuff they talk  about don't interest me
766,00:27:43.83,00:27:43.83, and I don't want to hear it.
767,00:27:45.77,00:27:45.77, I don't know.
768,00:27:47.03,00:27:47.03, They talk about a lot  of sex stuff.
769,00:27:49.60,00:27:49.60,  ( thunder crashing )
770,00:27:53.40,00:27:53.40,( rain pouring )
771,00:28:01.00,00:28:01.00," Wait, Rudy."
772,00:28:04.30,00:28:04.30,  You're going to be   good over there.
773,00:28:05.90,00:28:05.90,   GRETCHEN:   Keep your hands to yourself.
774,00:28:08.33,00:28:08.33, RUDY:    Everybody's hands   all over me.
775,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,"  Damn, Rudy."
776,00:28:25.23,00:28:25.23,   GRETCHEN:   It rained again last night
777,00:28:27.37,00:28:27.37, and we had to rebuild the roof
778,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,  of their shelter yesterday
779,00:28:31.43,00:28:31.43, and I think half of it   is leakproof
780,00:28:33.43,00:28:33.43," and half of it   doesn't have a roof,"
781,00:28:35.40,00:28:35.40,  and so a lot of us   got very wet.
782,00:28:37.03,00:28:37.03,And it's frustrating because we  had just moved from a shelter
783,00:28:40.53,00:28:40.53, that we had worked out all the bugs in
784,00:28:42.27,00:28:42.27,  and kept us 90% dry.
785,00:28:45.97,00:28:45.97," RUDY:    I was in there last night    and, uh, when the rain came"
786,00:28:50.63,00:28:50.63, all them women    eased down our way
787,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,   and I had about five women    in my lap all of a sudden.
788,00:28:55.53,00:28:55.53,Rudy was kicking me in the head. He doesn't care.
789,00:28:57.57,00:28:57.57," JENNA:  Oh, yeah, people were getting"
790,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,  kicked in the head  all night long
791,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17, because he got out three times
792,00:29:01.47,00:29:01.47,and he would just barrel through people.
793,00:29:03.87,00:29:03.87," RUDY:    I mean, the pillows were     right across me,"
794,00:29:06.70,00:29:06.70,  and I had to get up   and go to the head
795,00:29:08.47,00:29:08.47,and I couldn't.
796,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50, I don't know.
797,00:29:11.10,00:29:11.10,"  Rudy kicked me in the head,   like, three times last night"
798,00:29:12.80,00:29:12.80,"  and I said, ""Rudy, that's my head,"""
799,00:29:14.07,00:29:14.07," and he said, ""This is my space, so..."""
800,00:29:15.47,00:29:15.47,"I said, ""Rudy, that's my head."""
801,00:29:16.70,00:29:16.70,"He goes, ""That's my spot."""
802,00:29:17.97,00:29:17.97,"  ""I got to get out.   It's my spot."""
803,00:29:18.97,00:29:18.97,That's what he said.
804,00:29:20.47,00:29:20.47,   Did you ask him    to draw the outlines?
805,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67," Hey, I'm the old guy,  don't forget."
806,00:29:24.03,00:29:24.03,Them young guys   might have liked it.
807,00:29:26.23,00:29:26.23, It's a pain in the ass to me.
808,00:29:28.87,00:29:28.87,You do the honors.
809,00:29:30.33,00:29:30.33,"No, no, it's yours now."
810,00:29:31.97,00:29:31.97, ( both laugh )
811,00:29:33.40,00:29:33.40,   Hey! I guess it's    not in there
812,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40, but this is  different.
813,00:29:36.93,00:29:36.93,"""The next challenge, things couldn't be more fair."
814,00:29:40.77,00:29:40.77,"""Just take a deep breath and don't come up for air."
815,00:29:45.33,00:29:45.33,"  ""Immunity's the same    except for this one note."
816,00:29:48.10,00:29:48.10,"   ""Now only one will be safe"
817,00:29:49.63,00:29:49.63," while the rest of you face the vote."""
818,00:29:54.30,00:29:54.30,  I'm guessing
819,00:29:55.60,00:29:55.60,"it's a ""holding    your breath"" competition."
820,00:30:04.63,00:30:04.63,Welcome to Snake Island.
821,00:30:06.33,00:30:06.33,  Congratulations on surviving the first phase.
822,00:30:08.57,00:30:08.57,  You guys have now all proven
823,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,that you can definitely   survive the island.
824,00:30:12.40,00:30:12.40, I don't think   that's in question.
825,00:30:13.83,00:30:13.83, You've been here three weeks; everybody's doing great.
826,00:30:16.53,00:30:16.53,  Now it's going to be about   who can survive each other.
827,00:30:19.33,00:30:19.33,   How well you guys survive tribal politics.
828,00:30:21.40,00:30:21.40,"We've replaced the immunity idol    with an immunity talisman,"
829,00:30:24.67,00:30:24.67, so you will wear this    around your neck.
830,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,That means that    at Tribal Council
831,00:30:27.70,00:30:27.70,   you cannot have any votes    cast against you.
832,00:30:29.43,00:30:29.43,   You will not be voted off.
833,00:30:31.70,00:30:31.70," You can, however, vote  against others still,"
834,00:30:33.43,00:30:33.43,  so it's a great place to be.
835,00:30:34.93,00:30:34.93," This will go in the archives, this becomes the treasured icon."
836,00:30:39.43,00:30:39.43,   This is our first immunity    challenge as individuals.
837,00:30:41.57,00:30:41.57,   It's very simple. It's about holding your breath.
838,00:30:43.53,00:30:43.53,"  In the first round, all ten  of you will go under the water"
839,00:30:46.83,00:30:46.83,  to hold your breath.
840,00:30:48.07,00:30:48.07,You'll each hold   onto a bar that will
841,00:30:50.63,00:30:50.63,help keep you submerged.
842,00:30:52.40,00:30:52.40,   The last three to surface    go on to the final round.
843,00:30:55.60,00:30:55.60,  Make sense?
844,00:30:57.90,00:30:57.90,  Head on in.
845,00:31:10.43,00:31:10.43,  ( laughing )
846,00:31:16.93,00:31:16.93,Survivors ready?
847,00:31:18.53,00:31:18.53,  Go!
848,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,( laughs )
849,00:32:03.77,00:32:03.77,  ( laughing )
850,00:32:07.23,00:32:07.23,Come up for air.
851,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,"Good job, Sue."
852,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,"Yeah, good job, Sue."
853,00:32:25.37,00:32:25.37,   I guess I had to come up.
854,00:32:45.20,00:32:45.20,( clock's second hand ticking )
855,00:33:11.80,00:33:11.80,   Yeah.
856,00:33:17.97,00:33:17.97,Yay!
857,00:33:20.33,00:33:20.33, Is he dead?
858,00:33:23.70,00:33:23.70, Everybody's up.
859,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,"   Come on, Gervase."
860,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,He doesn't know if he should come up or not.
861,00:33:30.47,00:33:30.47,  ALL:   Yay!
862,00:33:36.33,00:33:36.33,"All right, Gervase!"
863,00:33:37.80,00:33:37.80,"  Sean, Gervase, Greg, you guys are moving on."
864,00:33:39.53,00:33:39.53,  The rest of you guys can sit up here
865,00:33:41.47,00:33:41.47,  on the dock with me    and take a break.
866,00:33:49.57,00:33:49.57," JEFF:    Final round, this is it."
867,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,"  Still about   holding your breath,"
868,00:33:53.77,00:33:53.77,  but now we're adding speed.
869,00:33:56.13,00:33:56.13, We're going to swim out    to a buoy.
870,00:33:57.73,00:33:57.73, At the bottom    of the ocean floor
871,00:33:59.40,00:33:59.40,"  are three ladders,   one for each of you."
872,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,"You're going to use the ladders     to get momentum,"
873,00:34:03.93,00:34:03.93, and along the way are buoys.
874,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40," Yank hard, release the buoy."
875,00:34:07.30,00:34:07.30, First person     to the end of the course
876,00:34:08.93,00:34:08.93,that's released all their buoys gets immunity.
877,00:34:11.53,00:34:11.53,Very simple.
878,00:34:13.57,00:34:13.57,"  Use the ladder,   it's much quicker."
879,00:34:14.93,00:34:14.93,All right?
880,00:34:16.00,00:34:16.00,Head out to your buoys.
881,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,I'll give you a start.
882,00:34:18.10,00:34:18.10,Good luck.
883,00:34:39.97,00:34:39.97,  Gervase! Greg! Sean!
884,00:34:42.33,00:34:42.33, This is for immunity--
885,00:34:44.60,00:34:44.60, the first individual immunity.
886,00:34:46.70,00:34:46.70,"   Win this, you cannot be voted off."
887,00:34:48.47,00:34:48.47,Survivors ready!
888,00:34:50.83,00:34:50.83,  Go!
889,00:35:34.23,00:35:34.23,Gervase!
890,00:35:35.53,00:35:35.53,"Close! Very close, Greg!"
891,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,( cheering )
892,00:35:41.23,00:35:41.23,"You all right, Gervase?"
893,00:35:43.30,00:35:43.30,"  Never swam like that in my life, man."
894,00:35:45.80,00:35:45.80,"  Towards the very end, he   was a smidgen ahead of me,"
895,00:35:49.33,00:35:49.33,"and no matter what I did,"
896,00:35:50.97,00:35:50.97, we were right  at each other.
897,00:35:52.77,00:35:52.77,Feel like Miss America?
898,00:35:54.57,00:35:54.57,"  It's all you, man,   it's all you."
899,00:36:21.87,00:36:21.87,"RICHARD:    But even though we aren't any longer two different teams,"
900,00:36:26.67,00:36:26.67, I still have a team.
901,00:36:28.23,00:36:28.23,  It's going to be interesting because we're not solid.
902,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33," We're solid with one another,"
903,00:36:32.23,00:36:32.23, but we're not  solidly unbeatable yet
904,00:36:35.40,00:36:35.40," just by circumstance, because     there are only four of us"
905,00:36:37.97,00:36:37.97,  and there are ten people     still left on the island.
906,00:36:41.37,00:36:41.37, KELLY:  When you get  in that Tribal Council
907,00:36:42.87,00:36:42.87,  and you walk up and you see   that little piece of paper
908,00:36:45.20,00:36:45.20, and the thing that you    put the vote in--
909,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,  it's all different.
910,00:36:49.73,00:36:49.73," You know, you might... you might have a thought"
911,00:36:52.93,00:36:52.93," and say, ""Hey, I really don't  want to vote this person off."""
912,00:36:56.13,00:36:56.13,  It's easier said than done.
913,00:36:57.87,00:36:57.87,  An alliance     is easier said than done.
914,00:36:59.83,00:36:59.83, GREG:   If people are fear- and self-preservation-motivated
915,00:37:02.67,00:37:02.67," they'll band together,  they'll form alliances,"
916,00:37:04.97,00:37:04.97, they'll start    beating people out
917,00:37:06.57,00:37:06.57,  to try and get rid    of the strong ones
918,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47," and get rid of this   and get rid of that,"
919,00:37:10.10,00:37:10.10,"   and, uh, you know, if that happens"
920,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,I hope they vote me off   really soon
921,00:37:13.30,00:37:13.30,"  because, uh, that to me is--"
922,00:37:15.83,00:37:15.83,"whoa, cool flying fish--"
923,00:37:18.13,00:37:18.13,  that to me is really boring.
924,00:37:22.07,00:37:22.07," JENNA:   Coming into this merger, I  consider it a brand-new tribe."
925,00:37:24.80,00:37:24.80, I want a vote     based on people's merits.
926,00:37:28.13,00:37:28.13, I don't want a vote based on
927,00:37:29.60,00:37:29.60," ""Let's get rid  of each of them first"
928,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,"and then  come back to our tribe."""
929,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,"I... I want a vote based on, uh,  who I really think should go,"
930,00:37:36.27,00:37:36.27, whether it be a member of our   tribe or a member of theirs.
931,00:37:52.23,00:37:52.23,"   All right, welcome to"
932,00:37:54.00,00:37:54.00,"  your first, uh, Tribal   Council as Rattana."
933,00:37:56.27,00:37:56.27,  Doesn't change   the rules.
934,00:37:58.10,00:37:58.10,  Doesn't change   anything here.
935,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,"   This is still    where you account    for your actions,"
936,00:38:01.40,00:38:01.40,"good or bad,"
937,00:38:02.83,00:38:02.83,"and, uh, by the end of the night"
938,00:38:04.87,00:38:04.87,   one of you will be    voted off the island.
939,00:38:06.73,00:38:06.73,   So let's talk    about the actions
940,00:38:08.43,00:38:08.43, of the past  few days.
941,00:38:09.50,00:38:09.50,Been a busy few days with the merger.
942,00:38:11.30,00:38:11.30,"   Richard, with the    rules changing"
943,00:38:12.73,00:38:12.73,  how has that changed    the group dynamic?
944,00:38:16.07,00:38:16.07,"   You know, I really haven't noticed"
945,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,much of a change   in the dynamic at all. Um...
946,00:38:20.53,00:38:20.53,"  we still seem to just get   along really, really well."
947,00:38:23.43,00:38:23.43,   There's only been two days  together as two teams
948,00:38:26.50,00:38:26.50,"so there isn't, uh, really time   for conflict to develop yet."
949,00:38:30.77,00:38:30.77,"Gretchen, is it    too soon to think"
950,00:38:32.87,00:38:32.87,  that strategies might shift?
951,00:38:34.97,00:38:34.97,"   Oh, I think people who are strategically playing the game,"
952,00:38:38.57,00:38:38.57," um, you know, strategy  has changed for them."
953,00:38:41.53,00:38:41.53,How so?
954,00:38:43.03,00:38:43.03,"Well, from who's strongest in your tribe to keep,"
955,00:38:45.50,00:38:45.50,now who's strongest in this one tribe to get rid of
956,00:38:48.37,00:38:48.37, 'cause they're    your biggest competition.
957,00:38:50.50,00:38:50.50,"Sean, aside from the physical--"
958,00:38:52.20,00:38:52.20,"who you want to hang out with, who you like being around--"
959,00:38:54.60,00:38:54.60,how big a factor is that
960,00:38:55.77,00:38:55.77,now going to play in who you vote for?
961,00:38:57.50,00:38:57.50,"Well, for me it's still    a very big factor."
962,00:38:59.40,00:38:59.40, I think there's a lot of room  in a group of ten to not think
963,00:39:02.73,00:39:02.73, ultra-strategically  just yet.
964,00:39:04.87,00:39:04.87,In talking to my tribe
965,00:39:06.07,00:39:06.07,and talking to their tribe as the ambassador
966,00:39:07.73,00:39:07.73,I think that most people are very concerned
967,00:39:09.73,00:39:09.73,"about alliances, just having"
968,00:39:11.87,00:39:11.87," a Tagi versus Pagong internal bloodbath, you know, and"
969,00:39:13.63,00:39:13.63,it's a--
970,00:39:15.47,00:39:15.47,"   yeah, that's a good word--"
971,00:39:16.80,00:39:16.80," but, uh, I don't think  that's going to occur."
972,00:39:19.13,00:39:19.13, The rain is really coming down all of a sudden.
973,00:39:21.23,00:39:21.23," All right, the only  person for whom"
974,00:39:23.83,00:39:23.83,  this does not really factor   in tonight is Greg.
975,00:39:26.77,00:39:26.77, You cannot vote  for Greg.
976,00:39:28.37,00:39:28.37,"  He however,   can still vote"
977,00:39:29.90,00:39:29.90," for you, and will vote for one of you."
978,00:39:33.53,00:39:33.53," So with that,"
979,00:39:34.70,00:39:34.70,  it's time to vote.
980,00:39:36.20,00:39:36.20,"  Greg, you're up first."
981,00:39:52.73,00:39:52.73,"  Either be here, or be gone."
982,00:40:11.67,00:40:11.67,  I'm voting for Rudy.
983,00:40:13.10,00:40:13.10," He's probably the person that  I respect most in the tribe,"
984,00:40:16.50,00:40:16.50, but the person I least  want to play the game with.
985,00:40:28.30,00:40:28.30, Overconfident.
986,00:40:41.87,00:40:41.87,  Moo.
987,00:40:49.83,00:40:49.83,   I am not really employing  any strategy.
988,00:40:52.63,00:40:52.63, I'm voting for Colleen today.
989,00:40:54.57,00:40:54.57,"I love her, she's cute,   adorable and nice to look at"
990,00:40:57.23,00:40:57.23,"and fun to have around,"
991,00:40:58.90,00:40:58.90, but she's the first  in a long list
992,00:41:01.10,00:41:01.10,   of alphabetical order
993,00:41:02.57,00:41:02.57,   and she won't get   another vote from me
994,00:41:04.27,00:41:04.27,unless she pisses me off  or something.

1024,00:43:45.63,00:43:45.63, the stakes have  definitely been raised.
1025,00:43:48.30,00:43:48.30,You guys can head back to camp.
1026,00:43:50.33,00:43:50.33,I'll see you tomorrow.

1028,00:44:08.43,00:44:08.43,  Greg cuts his play kitten  Colleen loose.
1029,00:44:10.57,00:44:10.57, You look right in the kitten's  eye and snap its neck.
1030,00:44:12.67,00:44:12.67, It's nothing personal;  you're hungry.
1031,00:44:14.10,00:44:14.10,  And makes a move on Rich.

1037,00:44:24.77,00:44:24.77,   Now it seems like  she wants to leave the island.
1038,00:44:32.37,00:44:32.37,I would hope that it was because
1039,00:44:33.63,00:44:33.63," they felt that  I was a threat,"
1040,00:44:35.37,00:44:35.37," unless, you know, people  had a conflict with me"
1041,00:44:37.20,00:44:37.20, and didn't  ever voice it--
1042,00:44:38.73,00:44:38.73, which I do think  is kind of an injustice.
1043,00:44:42.27,00:44:42.27, And I would hope
1044,00:44:44.07,00:44:44.07, that if somebody had  a problem with me
1045,00:44:45.47,00:44:45.47," they would say it.  So, you know, I can hope that,"
1046,00:44:47.10,00:44:47.10,but I won't know until I watch the show.
1047,00:44:48.87,00:44:48.87,I can hope that it was because
1048,00:44:49.87,00:44:49.87,they thought I was a threat.
1049,00:44:50.87,00:44:50.87,That would make me feel good.
