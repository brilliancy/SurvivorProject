1,00:00:02.17,00:00:02.17,  JEFF PROBST: 16 Americans forced to abandon ship
2,00:00:04.60,00:00:04.60, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:08.43,00:00:08.43," Marooned for 39 days, they must work together"
4,00:00:12.40,00:00:12.40,"  to build shelter,"
5,00:00:13.87,00:00:13.87," find food and survive   the island,"
6,00:00:16.63,00:00:16.63," but ultimately, it is everyone for themselves."
7,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,  Every third night
8,00:00:21.07,00:00:21.07, they will hike  deep into the jungle
9,00:00:23.50,00:00:23.50, to take part  in the Tribal Council
10,00:00:25.53,00:00:25.53, where they must vote    one of their own
11,00:00:27.07,00:00:27.07, off the island.
12,00:00:28.93,00:00:28.93,"  In the end,  only one will remain"
13,00:00:31.13,00:00:31.13,  and will leave the island
14,00:00:32.97,00:00:32.97,  with $1 million in cash.
15,00:00:37.93,00:00:37.93, Last week on Survivor:
16,00:00:40.20,00:00:40.20,  The merge was on everyone's mind
17,00:00:41.87,00:00:41.87,  as the two tribes prepared to become one.
18,00:00:44.73,00:00:44.73,  We do got the merge coming.
19,00:00:46.07,00:00:46.07,  ( growling )
20,00:00:47.67,00:00:47.67," JEFF:  At Tagi, Rich was flexing"
21,00:00:49.00,00:00:49.00, his voting alliance muscles.
22,00:00:50.73,00:00:50.73,RICHARD: I am in control
23,00:00:52.63,00:00:52.63,of who's being voted off
24,00:00:54.17,00:00:54.17, and I think that's all  that matters to me.
25,00:00:56.37,00:00:56.37, JEFF: And Sue was deciding
26,00:00:58.53,00:00:58.53, who on Pagong   should be voted off
27,00:01:00.13,00:01:00.13,  after the merge.
28,00:01:01.40,00:01:01.40,"  Greg, definitely--  he's just way"
29,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63, too psychotic.
30,00:01:04.20,00:01:04.20," JEFF:  At Pagong, Gervase made a comment"
31,00:01:06.03,00:01:06.03,  that upset his female tribe mates.
32,00:01:08.10,00:01:08.10, Girls are the stupidest things  on the planet next to cows.
33,00:01:10.27,00:01:10.27,"   Oh! He called us ""stupid."""
34,00:01:13.23,00:01:13.23, Go!
35,00:01:15.13,00:01:15.13, JEFF: The immunity challenge became   more competitive than ever
36,00:01:16.87,00:01:16.87," because if Pagong won,"
37,00:01:18.43,00:01:18.43,  they would enter the merge    with six members
38,00:01:20.73,00:01:20.73,"  to Tagi's four, giving them   a voting advantage."
39,00:01:23.57,00:01:23.57,"Yeah, you guys!"
40,00:01:24.87,00:01:24.87," JEFF: But Tagi won,"
41,00:01:26.30,00:01:26.30, insuring them that the tribes   would merge
42,00:01:28.63,00:01:28.63, at five members each.
43,00:01:30.07,00:01:30.07, The loss sent Pagong
44,00:01:31.97,00:01:31.97, back to Tribal Council   where Greg joined the women
45,00:01:35.53,00:01:35.53, in voting Joel off the island.
46,00:01:37.47,00:01:37.47,"  On the eve of the merge,  ten are left."
47,00:01:40.80,00:01:40.80,Who will be the first voted out   of the newly formed tribe?
48,00:01:48.33,00:01:48.33,  ( chanting )

51,00:02:43.57,00:02:43.57, Survivor has reacheda turning point.
52,00:02:46.33,00:02:46.33,"  Very soon, the ten remaining   members of Tagi and Pagong"
53,00:02:48.93,00:02:48.93,  will form one new tribe.
54,00:02:51.37,00:02:51.37, They will live together    but they will now compete
55,00:02:53.20,00:02:53.20,  against each other  individually.
56,00:02:55.67,00:02:55.67,  There are many questions to be answered:
57,00:02:57.60,00:02:57.60, Where will they live?
58,00:02:59.50,00:02:59.50,  What will this new tribe    call themselves?
59,00:03:01.40,00:03:01.40,  What kind of world  will they now create?
60,00:03:03.90,00:03:03.90," To begin the process,an ambassador from each tribe--"
61,00:03:07.20,00:03:07.20,  Jenna from Pagong  and Sean from Tagi--
62,00:03:10.23,00:03:10.23,  will assess the livability  of each other's camp.
63,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,  They will then paddle out  to the sand spit for a summit
64,00:03:15.50,00:03:15.50,  where they will negotiate   and decide
65,00:03:17.00,00:03:17.00,  on which of the two beaches
66,00:03:19.30,00:03:19.30, this new tribe of ten   will live.
67,00:03:20.50,00:03:20.50, Their decision will be final.
68,00:03:22.60,00:03:22.60," Sean is being guided    to Pagong Beach by Greg,"
69,00:03:25.30,00:03:25.30,  and Jenna is being guided    to Tagi by Kelly.
70,00:03:28.70,00:03:28.70, This is the first time    either ambassador
71,00:03:30.70,00:03:30.70, has seen the opposing tribe's  camp.
72,00:03:32.90,00:03:32.90, Our camp's way better  than theirs
73,00:03:34.40,00:03:34.40,   just from talking to them.
74,00:03:35.40,00:03:35.40,They don't have
75,00:03:36.40,00:03:36.40,"  a living room with benches,"
76,00:03:37.80,00:03:37.80, never mind a decent kitchen.
77,00:03:39.13,00:03:39.13,  I think our house is better
78,00:03:41.53,00:03:41.53,  from what they've described.
79,00:03:42.73,00:03:42.73, We have fish.
80,00:03:44.10,00:03:44.10,  Gretchen and I both fished  for an hour.
81,00:03:46.13,00:03:46.13, Really?
82,00:03:47.53,00:03:47.53,   Nothing. Not even a bite.
83,00:03:48.53,00:03:48.53, When do you guys fish?
84,00:03:50.07,00:03:50.07,"  Early morning, late evening."
85,00:03:51.47,00:03:51.47,"   Yeah, that's when we fish."
86,00:03:52.93,00:03:52.93," But, you know, we got the gay guy..."
87,00:03:54.50,00:03:54.50, gay compassionate guy.
88,00:03:55.50,00:03:55.50,"He's, like, middle-of-the-road."
89,00:03:56.77,00:03:56.77,And you got Sue
90,00:03:57.93,00:03:57.93,who says whateverthe hell's on her mind.
91,00:03:59.77,00:03:59.77, SUSAN: As far as somebody coming here
92,00:04:01.70,00:04:01.70,"   from Pagong today, it's going to be fun."
93,00:04:03.93,00:04:03.93," We like having company  over at camp,"
94,00:04:07.27,00:04:07.27,  even though we don't havea whole lot to offer for lunch.
95,00:04:09.90,00:04:09.90, I'm hoping...  I think the kicker of it all
96,00:04:11.40,00:04:11.40,   will be if Rich gets fish
97,00:04:12.77,00:04:12.77,  and we have fish for lunch.
98,00:04:14.10,00:04:14.10,  I think they'll be here.
99,00:04:15.20,00:04:15.20,And Rich... Richis a sweetheart.
100,00:04:18.73,00:04:18.73, So easygoing.
101,00:04:19.87,00:04:19.87,   He's naked a lot.
102,00:04:20.87,00:04:20.87,  Um... okay.
103,00:04:22.97,00:04:22.97,"   I'm excited about it being a big group, because right now"
104,00:04:25.87,00:04:25.87,  there's not a lot    of personalities going on
105,00:04:28.13,00:04:28.13, and it's quiet
106,00:04:29.73,00:04:29.73,"  and we've seen every inch   of this little place here,"
107,00:04:33.30,00:04:33.30," and I'm excited   to meet new people,"
108,00:04:36.03,00:04:36.03,"  and even if it's some good,    some bad,"
109,00:04:38.20,00:04:38.20,"  or whatever,   at least, it's something."
110,00:04:39.77,00:04:39.77,   It's a mix and so it'll bemore interesting
111,00:04:41.43,00:04:41.43, than it is right now.
112,00:04:42.77,00:04:42.77,"   Oh, good, they sent the doctor."

210,00:07:25.53,00:07:25.53,( laughing )
211,00:07:27.40,00:07:27.40,  That's what we  want you to say  when you get home.
212,00:07:29.13,00:07:29.13,  Just tell them
213,00:07:30.33,00:07:30.33,  how good  everything is.
214,00:07:31.60,00:07:31.60," Food, golden."
215,00:07:34.87,00:07:34.87," Yeah, when we merge tonight, I think it'll be interesting."
216,00:07:37.50,00:07:37.50,"   I think, uh, it'll set up   a whole nother set"
217,00:07:41.13,00:07:41.13,   of interpersonal dynamicsthat'll be fun for me to watch.
218,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,"Tell us more, uh, like, rumors you've heard about us,"
219,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13,  or things you think you know  about us...
220,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13, Okay.
221,00:07:47.90,00:07:47.90,  or what do you want to know   about us?
222,00:07:49.53,00:07:49.53,"   All right, um, let's see--   ""rumors that I've heard""--"
223,00:07:51.97,00:07:51.97,   that you guys are plotting   an alliance against us...
224,00:07:54.37,00:07:54.37,   divide and conquer sort of thing.
225,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,Really?
226,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,  That's the big one.
227,00:07:57.07,00:07:57.07,  The alliance that we have going on
228,00:07:58.47,00:07:58.47,"  is Rich, Rudy, Kelly and me."
229,00:08:01.50,00:08:01.50," We'll vote four people strong,"
230,00:08:03.07,00:08:03.07," and if we can make it  through the first two votes,"
231,00:08:05.23,00:08:05.23,  getting somebody    off of their team off...
232,00:08:06.93,00:08:06.93,  ( chuckles )
233,00:08:08.23,00:08:08.23,   we should be able to slideinto home plate.
234,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,That's what we said.
235,00:08:10.77,00:08:10.77,"   Yeah, you only get..."
236,00:08:12.50,00:08:12.50,   We don't know any of you;   you don't know any of us.
237,00:08:14.47,00:08:14.47,"Exactly,   and I'm so excited"
238,00:08:15.50,00:08:15.50, to get to knowfive new people.
239,00:08:16.83,00:08:16.83,   ( laughing ): So are we.
240,00:08:16.83,00:08:16.83,Cool.
241,00:08:17.83,00:08:17.83,Jenna's sincere.
242,00:08:19.03,00:08:19.03,She is sincere.
243,00:08:19.03,00:08:19.03,"I believeJenna's sincere,"
244,00:08:20.17,00:08:20.17,"and I thinkGretchen's sincere,"
245,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,"but Gren...Jenna is young, and not"
246,00:08:23.90,00:08:23.90,  a mature young  like you.
247,00:08:25.00,00:08:25.00,She's young.
248,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,Just babbling.
249,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,She's young flaky.
250,00:08:27.67,00:08:27.67, JENNA: I wanted to come across as a strong young mom
251,00:08:29.87,00:08:29.87,  'cause I think
252,00:08:30.87,00:08:30.87,they're often portrayed
253,00:08:31.87,00:08:31.87,"  as victims of circumstance,"
254,00:08:33.20,00:08:33.20,"   and, uh... wanted to be a good role model"
255,00:08:36.10,00:08:36.10, for my girls when they see it  when they get older.
256,00:08:37.97,00:08:37.97, She wants to be proud   for her children.
257,00:08:39.20,00:08:39.20,   Proud for your children--  win.
258,00:08:40.87,00:08:40.87,   She's just really   happy to be here.
259,00:08:42.07,00:08:42.07,Show your girls what it's aboutand how to win.
260,00:08:44.90,00:08:44.90,"  Six days ago, I was 180 out,   but, uh, I seen the light."
261,00:08:48.30,00:08:48.30,  It's... ( chuckles )
262,00:08:49.77,00:08:49.77," If you want to win this money, you got to get a little dirty."
263,00:08:52.90,00:08:52.90,"You know, who's next,don't you?"
264,00:08:54.27,00:08:54.27,"I don't need todeal with that.Who, after Greg?"
265,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,Jenna.
266,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,Jenna.
267,00:08:57.33,00:08:57.33,I was thinking Sean.
268,00:08:58.33,00:08:58.33,"   Oh, yeah."
269,00:08:59.33,00:08:59.33,He's too muchcompetition
270,00:09:00.67,00:09:00.67,and he will notparticipate.
271,00:09:02.23,00:09:02.23, The reason Sean's notin the alliance
272,00:09:06.30,00:09:06.30,   because... Sean...
273,00:09:08.20,00:09:08.20,is dumb.
274,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00," So, Sean, are they, uh, planning on banding together"
275,00:09:12.40,00:09:12.40, and picking us off one by one?
276,00:09:13.93,00:09:13.93,"SEAN:I think they've changedtheir minds, you know, because"
277,00:09:16.53,00:09:16.53,"I think they havevery nice, warm"
278,00:09:17.97,00:09:17.97,touchy feelingstowards you guys.
279,00:09:19.60,00:09:19.60,Sean's ethically against  any kind of alliance
280,00:09:22.70,00:09:22.70, and I hear Gretchen is similar   on the other side
281,00:09:25.93,00:09:25.93,"   and, um... I don't get it."
282,00:09:27.63,00:09:27.63," You know, I-I consider myself"
283,00:09:29.97,00:09:29.97,extraordinarily ethical   and moral
284,00:09:32.10,00:09:32.10,"  and, uh, this has"
285,00:09:33.47,00:09:33.47,  absolutely nothing to do   with this.
286,00:09:35.30,00:09:35.30,"  Uh, it sounds like  sheer stupidity to me"
287,00:09:37.47,00:09:37.47,  when somebody says
288,00:09:38.90,00:09:38.90," ""Oh, no, I'm not going to build an alliance,"
289,00:09:41.00,00:09:41.00,"  and I hope they wouldn't    do that either."""
290,00:09:43.37,00:09:43.37," Uh, you know, I giggle   and think, ""okay."""
291,00:09:46.10,00:09:46.10,  ( laughing )
292,00:09:47.60,00:09:47.60,"   God, I'm glad I'm   on your team."
293,00:09:48.60,00:09:48.60,"Yeah, baby."
294,00:09:50.23,00:09:50.23,Didn't comehere to...
295,00:09:52.00,00:09:52.00,make friends.
296,00:09:55.70,00:09:55.70,  I got to lugone of you guys?
297,00:09:59.13,00:09:59.13,GERVASE: Sean's cool.   Sean's a nice guy.
298,00:10:02.83,00:10:02.83,"He had a lot of storiesto tell, and..."
299,00:10:04.87,00:10:04.87,"   I mean, he... he was just, like, a genuine, honest guy--"
300,00:10:07.83,00:10:07.83,"you know, what he said,you just believed what he said."
301,00:10:10.90,00:10:10.90,  You can just tell   he wants to have some fun.
302,00:10:13.53,00:10:13.53," He hasn't had fun yet,    so, uh..."
303,00:10:15.17,00:10:15.17,we'll bring lots of fun his way.
304,00:10:16.80,00:10:16.80,  We'll keep him entertained.
305,00:10:18.23,00:10:18.23,( both talking at once )
306,00:10:19.60,00:10:19.60,I will.
307,00:10:21.17,00:10:21.17," Bye, Rich. Bye, Rudy."
308,00:10:23.13,00:10:23.13, RUDY:  Jenna and Sean are going  to have a good time talking.
309,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13, I don't know which onetalks the most.
310,00:10:28.47,00:10:28.47,   She ain't shut up since she's been here.
311,00:10:37.63,00:10:37.63,"Bye, guys."
312,00:10:38.77,00:10:38.77,"Bye, girl."
313,00:10:40.03,00:10:40.03,"Bye, Sean!"
314,00:11:04.93,00:11:04.93," JEFF: Welcome, Jenna."
315,00:11:06.90,00:11:06.90,A chair just for you.
316,00:11:09.10,00:11:09.10,Welcome.
317,00:11:09.10,00:11:09.10,And look at me--I didn't dressfor dinner.
318,00:11:11.07,00:11:11.07,How you doing?Nice to see you.
319,00:11:11.07,00:11:11.07,Nice to see you.
320,00:11:13.40,00:11:13.40,  One chair for you.
321,00:11:13.40,00:11:13.40, Hello. How are you?
322,00:11:14.93,00:11:14.93,"Wow, we're offto a good start."
323,00:11:16.37,00:11:16.37,A little kiss--I like that.
324,00:11:16.37,00:11:16.37,Pretty cool.
325,00:11:18.50,00:11:18.50," Well, here's the deal:"
326,00:11:19.97,00:11:19.97,You guys are ambassadorsfor your tribes.
327,00:11:22.27,00:11:22.27, You have a very important tasktonight.
328,00:11:24.90,00:11:24.90,"  We wanted you to  feel like ambassadors,  so we've prepared"
329,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03," some lobster,  you have some bread,"
330,00:11:30.10,00:11:30.10,"baked potatoes,"
331,00:11:31.43,00:11:31.43," butter for the lobster,"
332,00:11:33.43,00:11:33.43,"   uh, lemon-- I don't think"
333,00:11:35.63,00:11:35.63,  we missed anything  except for the wine
334,00:11:37.27,00:11:37.27, which is being chilled   right now.
335,00:11:38.47,00:11:38.47,What I needin the morning is
336,00:11:40.30,00:11:40.30,"   on this parchment, with   a couple of pens in here,"
337,00:11:41.70,00:11:41.70,  to have the new nameof the tribe...
338,00:11:44.97,00:11:44.97,"   which camp you're going to be at,"
339,00:11:46.67,00:11:46.67,  and the three items you're taking.
340,00:11:48.30,00:11:48.30,You'll be given one new colorfor this new tribe--
341,00:11:51.03,00:11:51.03,   green-- yellow and   orange no longer used
342,00:11:52.83,00:11:52.83,   to represent opposing tribes.
343,00:11:54.33,00:11:54.33,You are now one.
344,00:11:55.37,00:11:55.37,There's also stuff
345,00:11:56.43,00:11:56.43,to make two new flags for camp.
346,00:11:58.47,00:11:58.47,"There are paintbrushes, paints,"
347,00:12:00.60,00:12:00.60,"so once you decide on the name,  you can go to town on that."
348,00:12:04.43,00:12:04.43,   Can we eat first?
349,00:12:05.67,00:12:05.67, You can do...  you have all night.
350,00:12:07.13,00:12:07.13," As you can see... right here,   we have two beds."
351,00:12:09.40,00:12:09.40,( laughing )
352,00:12:09.40,00:12:09.40,"Oh, my God."
353,00:12:10.50,00:12:10.50,So we are definitelystaying here tonight?
354,00:12:12.43,00:12:12.43, You are here all night.
355,00:12:14.20,00:12:14.20,"   Jenna, how stylin' are we!"
356,00:12:28.77,00:12:28.77,  I immediately saw the table set up with...
357,00:12:30.90,00:12:30.90, it was like a romantic dinner.
358,00:12:32.57,00:12:32.57," It was like this table all set  up with everything, two beds"
359,00:12:35.27,00:12:35.27,  off to the right
360,00:12:36.70,00:12:36.70," single, like,   really nice sheets"
361,00:12:39.27,00:12:39.27,"   and pillows and blankets,   and, uh..."
362,00:12:40.63,00:12:40.63," like, a stump,"
363,00:12:41.97,00:12:41.97," we had a bedside table,"
364,00:12:43.40,00:12:43.40,"  we had lanterns everywhere,  tiki torches,"
365,00:12:45.17,00:12:45.17,  and the first thing    I thought was...
366,00:12:46.90,00:12:46.90,"   ""Oh, man,   they're so setting this up"
367,00:12:48.50,00:12:48.50,"for it to be romantic with Sean"""
368,00:12:50.50,00:12:50.50,  and there's just...   there's not a spark there.
369,00:12:52.70,00:12:52.70,"Making out's, I think,first base;"
370,00:12:54.60,00:12:54.60,"second base, up the shirt;"
371,00:12:55.90,00:12:55.90,third base...
372,00:12:55.90,00:12:55.90,"Okay, okay."
373,00:12:57.60,00:12:57.60,  But I often give a bad first impression sometimes.
374,00:13:00.60,00:13:00.60,You never heardof bases like that?
375,00:13:02.33,00:13:02.33,  I always just knew  what the home run was.
376,00:13:04.10,00:13:04.10, I'm all about the goal.
377,00:13:05.23,00:13:05.23,  I'm goal-oriented.
378,00:13:06.23,00:13:06.23,Sliding into home plate
379,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,here's Jenna.
380,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,Okay.
381,00:13:10.07,00:13:10.07,  They wanted it to be more romantic
382,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50," than it was ever going to be,   but, uh..."
383,00:13:13.30,00:13:13.30," from either end of us,    but we really had"
384,00:13:15.33,00:13:15.33," an exceptional time,  and we tied one on, you know,"
385,00:13:19.13,00:13:19.13,"uh, finished the bottlesof wine,"
386,00:13:20.87,00:13:20.87,"and we ate like   kings and queens,"
387,00:13:22.37,00:13:22.37,"   and, uh, it was fantastic."
388,00:13:23.80,00:13:23.80,"Uh, we saw Pagong's fire was still lit"
389,00:13:25.73,00:13:25.73," so I was like,   ""Oh, I want to call home."
390,00:13:27.67,00:13:27.67,"   They're probably worried."""
391,00:13:29.07,00:13:29.07,"  And, uh, so we threwa bunch of kerosene on our fire"
392,00:13:31.57,00:13:31.57,"   to make it whoosh,"
393,00:13:32.80,00:13:32.80," and they said they saw that,"
394,00:13:34.43,00:13:34.43,  so I hoped that they would figure
395,00:13:36.23,00:13:36.23," that I was still there,    that I was okay."
396,00:13:38.17,00:13:38.17,Whoa. Fireon the spit.
397,00:13:40.90,00:13:40.90,It seems so far awayfrom the island.
398,00:13:44.03,00:13:44.03, GREG:  They had to have fed Jenna.
399,00:13:46.83,00:13:46.83,"I mean, the summit goingfrom 4:00 in the afternoon"
400,00:13:50.10,00:13:50.10,  until... well after dark...
401,00:13:52.13,00:13:52.13, Yeah. They're not going to let her starve.
402,00:13:54.17,00:13:54.17,With one lunch.
403,00:13:55.60,00:13:55.60,"  Well, Gervase can save hers in case... his"
404,00:13:58.17,00:13:58.17,  in case she... wants to see what it would have been like.
405,00:14:05.40,00:14:05.40, JENNA: We talked all night.
406,00:14:07.83,00:14:07.83, It helped that they had   four bottles of wine there.
407,00:14:10.73,00:14:10.73, So we drank them all
408,00:14:12.33,00:14:12.33," and, uh, we were both pretty drunk."
409,00:14:14.63,00:14:14.63,"   And... it's raining,   and we're inside now."
410,00:14:16.83,00:14:16.83,We just made it.
411,00:14:16.83,00:14:16.83,We're completelycovered.
412,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,We had a great meal.
413,00:14:21.43,00:14:21.43,"Me, I'm exhausted fromall this wine."
414,00:14:25.20,00:14:25.20,   Do you want to go to bed?
415,00:14:57.10,00:14:57.10,   GRETCHEN:  We're just waiting    'cause no one's given us
416,00:14:59.53,00:14:59.53,  any information.
417,00:15:00.70,00:15:00.70," So, I mean, last night"
418,00:15:02.23,00:15:02.23,we were wondering where she was.
419,00:15:03.83,00:15:03.83," And then somebody said   ""Well, she can't come back"
420,00:15:05.23,00:15:05.23," until the negotiations   are over."""
421,00:15:06.57,00:15:06.57,  But there's really nothing  to negotiate.
422,00:15:07.63,00:15:07.63, We could have made a shelter
423,00:15:09.07,00:15:09.07, in that time.  We could have made--
424,00:15:10.70,00:15:10.70,"  whatever they're    negotiating for,"
425,00:15:11.90,00:15:11.90,  we could have movedour whole camp--
426,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,been done in that time.
427,00:15:14.57,00:15:14.57," So I don't, I don't know what  the whole process is about."
428,00:15:15.90,00:15:15.90, We miss Jenna.
429,00:15:17.00,00:15:17.00,  We haven't seen Jenna at all
430,00:15:19.33,00:15:19.33,"  since she's left,"
431,00:15:20.80,00:15:20.80,  and we were kind of worried  about her last night
432,00:15:23.03,00:15:23.03,when it got dark  and she wasn't here.
433,00:15:24.77,00:15:24.77, GREG: I'd be wasting   my time and energy
434,00:15:27.43,00:15:27.43,"to, uh, guess what's happening."
435,00:15:29.57,00:15:29.57,So I don't even bother.
436,00:15:30.90,00:15:30.90,What's going on?
437,00:15:32.00,00:15:32.00, It's a beautiful day.
438,00:15:33.20,00:15:33.20,The sun's nice.
439,00:15:34.30,00:15:34.30,   You can see Mount Kinabalu
440,00:15:35.80,00:15:35.80,"and, uh,   we're going to go fishing."
441,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,   RUDY:   That's a big one.
442,00:15:39.07,00:15:39.07,"RICHARD:Yeah, he's a good fatty."
443,00:15:41.27,00:15:41.27,That's a lot of meat.
444,00:15:43.27,00:15:43.27,"  They talked about some kind   of a negotiation,"
445,00:15:46.20,00:15:46.20, and I would imagine if the two   parties had opposing views
446,00:15:50.40,00:15:50.40,as to what camp  they should move to
447,00:15:52.80,00:15:52.80, that the negotiation  might go on--
448,00:15:54.97,00:15:54.97,  or might be interesting.
449,00:15:56.53,00:15:56.53," But since both parties,"
450,00:15:58.07,00:15:58.07,"  as far as we know,   want to move to this camp,"
451,00:16:01.50,00:16:01.50,I can't imagine what's going on   on the sand spit.
452,00:16:03.97,00:16:03.97," SUSAN:  We're not sure yet,   because Sean has been gone"
453,00:16:06.13,00:16:06.13,  almost 24 hours now  since we sent him off
454,00:16:08.23,00:16:08.23, on the messenger thing.
455,00:16:10.97,00:16:10.97,  So the anticipation  of waiting for Sean
456,00:16:13.93,00:16:13.93,   is just actually starting   to drive us wild.
457,00:16:44.70,00:16:44.70," Oh, my God!"
458,00:16:46.23,00:16:46.23,   I have so much   to tell you guys.
459,00:16:56.07,00:16:56.07,First things first--
460,00:16:57.77,00:16:57.77,  we are moving.
461,00:16:59.07,00:16:59.07,We have five minutesfrom when we banked
462,00:17:01.67,00:17:01.67,to get everything inyour backpacks--
463,00:17:03.90,00:17:03.90,to get your luxury item.
464,00:17:05.60,00:17:05.60,   Only what you brought   in your backpacks
465,00:17:07.47,00:17:07.47,   and luxury item--
466,00:17:08.77,00:17:08.77,"  and three objects,  which we chose,"
467,00:17:10.13,00:17:10.13,  and we're out of here.
468,00:17:11.57,00:17:11.57,   And we told Pagong  the unfortunate news
469,00:17:13.63,00:17:13.63,   that they had five minutes to pack their things--
470,00:17:16.50,00:17:16.50, get their luxury itemand choose three items.
471,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10," Which we decided were the wool blanket that they have,"
472,00:17:21.50,00:17:21.50," the mosquito netting,"
473,00:17:22.73,00:17:22.73,  so we could sleep
474,00:17:24.27,00:17:24.27,"  under the mosquito netting,"
475,00:17:26.17,00:17:26.17,"  and the, um, cooking pot."
476,00:17:27.57,00:17:27.57,"We were givena luxury dinner,"
477,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,but we had to decidea new name
478,00:17:31.60,00:17:31.60,"and we had to paintthe new flag,"
479,00:17:33.90,00:17:33.90,  and we had to pick  a location--
480,00:17:35.93,00:17:35.93,she likedour camp a lot.
481,00:17:37.47,00:17:37.47,  You guys will love it.
482,00:17:38.87,00:17:38.87,"Actually, Sean let me do  almost all of the deciding."
483,00:17:41.00,00:17:41.00,"I came up with the name,  he added an ""a"" on the end."
484,00:17:43.27,00:17:43.27,  Jenna came up with the name.
485,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17, It had to be something that  was indigenous to the island
486,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13," and, you know, we have a lot  of rattan wood here."
487,00:17:50.57,00:17:50.57,"  And we just added an ""a"""
488,00:17:51.70,00:17:51.70, to make it sound more exotic.
489,00:17:53.20,00:17:53.20,   That was my idea.
490,00:17:54.63,00:17:54.63,"   You know, give it a littleflair, a little pizzazz."
491,00:17:56.90,00:17:56.90,"   JENNA:   As we were dining   on lobster and, um..."
492,00:17:58.33,00:17:58.33, baked potatoes.
493,00:18:00.50,00:18:00.50,SEAN:Dessert.
494,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,JENNA:Four bottles of wine.
495,00:18:02.87,00:18:02.87,SEAN:Four bottles of wine.Four bottles of wine.
496,00:18:05.20,00:18:05.20,   A hangoverin the morning.
497,00:18:06.20,00:18:06.20,"A hangover, a bed..."
498,00:18:06.20,00:18:06.20,"Beds, a tent."
499,00:18:07.70,00:18:07.70," GREG:  You know, they come back"
500,00:18:09.00,00:18:09.00,  having had a great night
501,00:18:10.30,00:18:10.30," and ""oh, my God, I can't waitto tell you guys"
502,00:18:12.60,00:18:12.60," how much we've eaten."""
503,00:18:13.77,00:18:13.77, And that's wonderful.
504,00:18:15.23,00:18:15.23, That's how ambassadors   should be treated.
505,00:18:16.93,00:18:16.93,"   But, you know, of course,   when you're on an island"
506,00:18:19.50,00:18:19.50,surviving on white rice   and the occasional fish...
507,00:18:22.13,00:18:22.13, SEAN: Four croissants  with orange marmalade
508,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,  and strawberry jam.
509,00:18:25.67,00:18:25.67,Coffee... four bottles.
510,00:18:27.77,00:18:27.77,"   Hey, tell me a little bit more about it."
511,00:18:29.50,00:18:29.50,I'd love to hear  about butter sauce.
512,00:18:30.93,00:18:30.93,Like... thanks.
513,00:18:33.97,00:18:33.97,"GERVASE: I mean,    it just makes more sense"
514,00:18:35.73,00:18:35.73, to go to their side.
515,00:18:37.37,00:18:37.37,"  I mean, I think that's what everybody wanted to do anyway."
516,00:18:39.27,00:18:39.27,  Everybody wanted to get outof this section
517,00:18:40.73,00:18:40.73, just for a new change   of scenery.
518,00:18:42.60,00:18:42.60, We've been here for 20 days.
519,00:18:44.80,00:18:44.80,  We've seen it. We know it.
520,00:18:46.23,00:18:46.23," So it was just like,"
521,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,"   you know,let's try something new."
522,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,COLLEEN: Sean was even saying there'senough room for us in the hutch
523,00:18:52.07,00:18:52.07," because enough people  sleep outside, so..."
524,00:18:53.80,00:18:53.80, It's going to go quick.
525,00:18:55.90,00:18:55.90," God, I hope it goes quick from here on out, you know. Really."
526,00:18:59.07,00:18:59.07," When I first got here, I... you know,"
527,00:19:00.63,00:19:00.63,I think maybe I would have beenmore comfortable
528,00:19:04.47,00:19:04.47,"   on the other team,  because I, you know,"
529,00:19:05.90,00:19:05.90,"from what I understand,they pulled their camp together,"
530,00:19:08.77,00:19:08.77,"  they got their stuff  hanging up,"
531,00:19:10.33,00:19:10.33,"   which is, like, something   that's been bothering me"
532,00:19:12.40,00:19:12.40,"   since the day we got here, and..."
533,00:19:13.80,00:19:13.80, but I think it was good for me to be with this tribe
534,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,"  because, um, you don't have  to work all the time"
535,00:19:19.80,00:19:19.80,  and you don't have   to be busting butt.
536,00:19:21.33,00:19:21.33," It's nice... you know,"
537,00:19:22.33,00:19:22.33, we're healthy and we're happy
538,00:19:24.43,00:19:24.43,  and we spend a lot   of time having fun.
539,00:19:26.43,00:19:26.43," So I think it taught   me something, too."
540,00:19:28.43,00:19:28.43,  You can be very comfortable
541,00:19:31.03,00:19:31.03,"  and I don't feel like I need   to bust butt all the time,"
542,00:19:33.53,00:19:33.53,and I've had a good timewhile I'm here.
543,00:19:35.40,00:19:35.40, So I'll be glad to go with the other tribe
544,00:19:37.47,00:19:37.47,  and I was glad to bewith this tribe.
545,00:20:06.53,00:20:06.53, GREG:  It's like starting over.
546,00:20:08.77,00:20:08.77,  We've left behind
547,00:20:10.23,00:20:10.23,  a lot of things-- a lot of material possessions.
548,00:20:12.90,00:20:12.90,"  Metaphysically, we've also   left behind"
549,00:20:14.57,00:20:14.57,  a lot of emotional issues.
550,00:20:16.33,00:20:16.33,  Um... there was    a lot of baggage
551,00:20:19.50,00:20:19.50,that we left on that... on that Pagong Beach.
552,00:20:23.57,00:20:23.57,"  But, uh..."
553,00:20:26.03,00:20:26.03,we're moving on  to bigger and better things.
554,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47,  I'm excited.
555,00:20:30.03,00:20:30.03,  I did feel sadness  when we left Pagong.
556,00:20:31.93,00:20:31.93," Looking back, that was where"
557,00:20:33.70,00:20:33.70,   we rode to the first day   when we were shipwrecked.
558,00:20:36.07,00:20:36.07, It was where I'd formed a bond with eight...
559,00:20:38.30,00:20:38.30,"   seven other people, so..."
560,00:20:39.30,00:20:39.30,  it was sad.
561,00:20:40.83,00:20:40.83,  But it was a new beginning for me-- a whole nother tribe.
562,00:20:43.00,00:20:43.00, Are we close to Tagi?
563,00:20:45.27,00:20:45.27,I don't think that'swhat it's called anymore.
564,00:20:48.27,00:20:48.27,   It's Rattana.
565,00:20:49.30,00:20:49.30,( laughing and talking )
566,00:20:53.63,00:20:53.63,"  Come on, left side."
567,00:20:55.83,00:20:55.83," Come on, left side."
568,00:21:03.90,00:21:03.90,"God, it'sbeautiful."
569,00:21:06.73,00:21:06.73," Yeah, it really is."
570,00:21:08.43,00:21:08.43,"COLLEEN:  So Rich came out,   it was like"
571,00:21:10.40,00:21:10.40,"  ""Hey, how are you?"""
572,00:21:11.73,00:21:11.73," You know, he swam out, which was really nice."
573,00:21:13.63,00:21:13.63,They welcomed uswith open arms.
574,00:21:15.43,00:21:15.43,  We got along really well.
575,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,Welcome.
576,00:21:18.70,00:21:18.70,Ooh!
577,00:21:26.67,00:21:26.67," So, what they  were really doing was coming"
578,00:21:28.53,00:21:28.53," to the beach and, uh, were moving in"
579,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,  with what thingsthey could have gotten together
580,00:21:32.60,00:21:32.60,  in the five minutes  that they had
581,00:21:33.90,00:21:33.90,"  to get together, I guess."
582,00:21:35.00,00:21:35.00,I was glad to see that.
583,00:21:36.60,00:21:36.60,Hi. Niceto see you again.
584,00:21:37.83,00:21:37.83,"Can I get a hug,all right?"
585,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17," You, too, handsome."
586,00:21:40.17,00:21:40.17,Were you guysworried about me?
587,00:21:42.17,00:21:42.17,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
588,00:21:46.53,00:21:46.53,Clothesline.
589,00:21:48.47,00:21:48.47,  House.
590,00:21:49.83,00:21:49.83,Living room.
591,00:21:50.90,00:21:50.90,Kitchen.
592,00:21:51.97,00:21:51.97,   Bathroom.
593,00:21:52.97,00:21:52.97,"Oh, my."
594,00:21:54.10,00:21:54.10,   The house ain't done yet.
595,00:21:55.37,00:21:55.37," We can't tour   the house yet, no."
596,00:21:57.37,00:21:57.37, GREG:  A boy named Sue.
597,00:21:58.40,00:21:58.40,"  Strong, loud, with an accent"
598,00:22:00.67,00:22:00.67,   that'll drive you up the wall!
599,00:22:02.77,00:22:02.77,Was he talking about me?
600,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,Yeah.
601,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,"Oh, yeah."
602,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,"  Oh, come on!"
603,00:22:06.17,00:22:06.17,I'm up.
604,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,Remind meto do it.
605,00:22:08.73,00:22:08.73,"Yeah, you hada good one."
606,00:22:10.17,00:22:10.17,This thing'sabout 300 years old.
607,00:22:12.23,00:22:12.23," I think Rudy's very set in his ways,"
608,00:22:14.10,00:22:14.10,"  so having, you know,"
609,00:22:15.57,00:22:15.57,"  five new people move in,  it scared him a lot,"
610,00:22:17.30,00:22:17.30,  so he was just sitting back
611,00:22:18.77,00:22:18.77," and he was assessing the situation, I think."
612,00:22:20.97,00:22:20.97,"All of a sudden,   we doubled our population."
613,00:22:23.77,00:22:23.77,"  Uh, the house got smaller,"
614,00:22:25.80,00:22:25.80," the pots got smaller,"
615,00:22:28.40,00:22:28.40,"  and, uh..."
616,00:22:30.67,00:22:30.67,"  personally,it's a pain in the ass."
617,00:22:32.90,00:22:32.90,"New people,new scene..."
618,00:22:35.17,00:22:35.17,"new thingsto talk about,you know."
619,00:22:37.90,00:22:37.90,( general conversation )
620,00:22:40.23,00:22:40.23, KELLY: It's almost too good.
621,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,"  Like, everybody's too..."
622,00:22:43.27,00:22:43.27,"  ""Oh, you go first."""
623,00:22:44.77,00:22:44.77,"  ""No, you go first,""   oh, you know, everybody's"
624,00:22:46.97,00:22:46.97," being real, real super polite,    you know, which is cool."
625,00:22:49.80,00:22:49.80,COLLEEN:  Sean is very intelligent.
626,00:22:52.07,00:22:52.07,  Sometimes he says   interesting things.
627,00:22:53.87,00:22:53.87, Sometimes you tune out
628,00:22:55.23,00:22:55.23,"  for a while, and then he hits on something"
629,00:22:56.87,00:22:56.87," so you tune back in, you know."
630,00:22:58.33,00:22:58.33,"   I mean, he's always going."
631,00:22:59.40,00:22:59.40,"SEAN:Girls always rank""sense of humor"""
632,00:23:01.17,00:23:01.17," then, like, ""ambition"" and then all this other stuff"
633,00:23:03.33,00:23:03.33," and then rank ""looks,""   like, number five or six."
634,00:23:05.13,00:23:05.13,"But meanwhile,I know so manyunambitious,"
635,00:23:07.67,00:23:07.67,"good-looking guys,"
636,00:23:08.73,00:23:08.73,"who have absolutelyno personality,"
637,00:23:10.57,00:23:10.57,that still geta lot of girls.
638,00:23:12.47,00:23:12.47,I'm really goingto get skinny.
639,00:23:14.50,00:23:14.50,  I got to go back  in the water. Bye.
640,00:23:16.60,00:23:16.60," GREG: Rich is clever    and, uh... I mean"
641,00:23:18.63,00:23:18.63, we'll start being honest now.
642,00:23:20.50,00:23:20.50,  I think Rich thinks   he's very clever.
643,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17," He is, uh, relatively sharp,   and, uh..."
644,00:23:25.60,00:23:25.60,"he has a lot of things going on   in his mind that he, uh..."
645,00:23:29.50,00:23:29.50,"  selectively decides, uh,   what he will share"
646,00:23:32.83,00:23:32.83, and with whom.
647,00:23:33.97,00:23:33.97,"  Rich is playing a big game,"
648,00:23:36.17,00:23:36.17,"   which is very fun, so he's awfully entertaining."
649,00:23:39.23,00:23:39.23, KELLY:  That... it was suggested...
650,00:23:42.60,00:23:42.60,"   that we should, you know,"
651,00:23:43.97,00:23:43.97," ""beef up"" the supportsand everything."
652,00:23:46.10,00:23:46.10," Okay, which, you know,  I don't know"
653,00:23:48.23,00:23:48.23," I don't know anything   about shingles and roofing,"
654,00:23:50.93,00:23:50.93,"and I just know   how to tie knots,"
655,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,   that's pretty much all I know how to do.
656,00:24:04.20,00:24:04.20,Okay.
657,00:24:05.57,00:24:05.57,  It ain't going  nowhere.
658,00:24:08.90,00:24:08.90,You might wantto tie this.
659,00:24:11.77,00:24:11.77,  Ow!
660,00:24:13.23,00:24:13.23,Up and down.
661,00:24:14.37,00:24:14.37,   ( loud crashing )
662,00:24:16.83,00:24:16.83,That doesn't sound good.
663,00:24:18.60,00:24:18.60,"   Oh, yeah."
664,00:24:19.60,00:24:19.60,( hearty laughter )
665,00:24:21.10,00:24:21.10,I didn'ttouch it.
666,00:24:21.10,00:24:21.10,"Oh, my God!"
667,00:24:22.90,00:24:22.90,That did notjust happen.
668,00:24:25.47,00:24:25.47,"  Oh, my God."
669,00:24:26.70,00:24:26.70,"   And, bam, shingles break,"
670,00:24:28.97,00:24:28.97, the whole roof  comes crashing down.
671,00:24:31.90,00:24:31.90,Felt like such an idiot.
672,00:24:33.60,00:24:33.60,It figures that the daythat everyone shows up
673,00:24:35.57,00:24:35.57,the whole roof caves in  while they're repairing it.
674,00:24:37.90,00:24:37.90,"  Yeah, it's the same as it is   back home, ladies,"
675,00:24:40.50,00:24:40.50,  here in the jungle.
676,00:24:41.50,00:24:41.50,The women are doing all the work
677,00:24:43.77,00:24:43.77,  and the guys  are just hanging out
678,00:24:45.57,00:24:45.57,"  and b.s.'ing, yeah."
679,00:24:46.80,00:24:46.80,   It's my turn.
680,00:24:48.27,00:24:48.27,  I pick up  from here.
681,00:24:49.70,00:24:49.70,It's a hit.
682,00:24:50.83,00:24:50.83,I can hit you this card;you can't drop.
683,00:24:53.03,00:24:53.03,Every time you get hit
684,00:24:54.37,00:24:54.37,you have to stay aroundone more round.
685,00:25:01.13,00:25:01.13, ( gasping )
686,00:25:03.07,00:25:03.07,"Very good, Rich."
687,00:25:04.37,00:25:04.37,( chuckles )
688,00:25:06.07,00:25:06.07,"  The guys are kind of bummingaround, but I think that's good"
689,00:25:08.50,00:25:08.50,  'cause I think all the guys got to get to know each other.
690,00:25:10.93,00:25:10.93,RICHARD: Isn't that beautiful?
691,00:25:12.80,00:25:12.80,Don't lie.
692,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,"It looks like mucus,doesn't it?"
693,00:25:17.03,00:25:17.03,"SUSAN:Oh, yeah."
694,00:25:18.17,00:25:18.17,Jammin'.
695,00:25:20.07,00:25:20.07,"You see it, Sue?"
696,00:25:21.23,00:25:21.23,   You see anything?
697,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,( laughing )
698,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73," It's how men and women relate,   you know."
699,00:25:25.50,00:25:25.50,  The women-- we work together
700,00:25:27.07,00:25:27.07,  and we... it's a little...    women are always
701,00:25:28.73,00:25:28.73,"  a little bit competitive in everything we do, you know,"
702,00:25:30.83,00:25:30.83, so it's like  when you're working together
703,00:25:32.60,00:25:32.60, you're seeing  what the other person
704,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,"  can do, and you're proving  each other at the same time."
705,00:25:36.87,00:25:36.87,Men can sit down   and talk for hours
706,00:25:38.30,00:25:38.30, and walk away friends.
707,00:25:41.50,00:25:41.50,You got the hangof it now.
708,00:25:43.43,00:25:43.43,   ( hearty chuckle )
709,00:25:44.43,00:25:44.43,  Gervase was great.
710,00:25:45.60,00:25:45.60,   I beat the hell out of him
711,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,"  in a number of games that I've never played before,"
712,00:25:49.77,00:25:49.77," and he's, uh,  he's good at cards."
713,00:25:52.10,00:25:52.10,   I think he could have beenletting me win.
714,00:25:54.57,00:25:54.57," Uh, who knows?"
715,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80," He could be playing the odds,  too."
716,00:25:58.10,00:25:58.10,  It's natural to me.
717,00:25:59.50,00:25:59.50,"What I do, I don't think  I'm doing anything special."
718,00:26:01.93,00:26:01.93, I'm just being myself.
719,00:26:03.57,00:26:03.57,"  But other people always say,   like, ""You're a charmer."""
720,00:26:05.63,00:26:05.63,"   ""You're a smooth talker."""
721,00:26:07.10,00:26:07.10,"   Looking real good   there, Rich."
722,00:26:08.23,00:26:08.23,Thanks.
723,00:26:08.23,00:26:08.23,Real good there.
724,00:26:09.30,00:26:09.30,Can you tellI'm losing?
725,00:26:09.30,00:26:09.30,Yeah.
726,00:26:11.00,00:26:11.00,"That makes me happy,'cause I can't tell."
727,00:26:15.50,00:26:15.50,   They don't...
728,00:26:16.50,00:26:16.50,they don'tcook out enough.
729,00:26:17.77,00:26:17.77,They're... they're greatfor bait
730,00:26:19.87,00:26:19.87,   but their insides   is just nothing but guts.
731,00:26:22.10,00:26:22.10,Greg's an interesting character.
732,00:26:23.60,00:26:23.60,"He's young, too.He's 24,"
733,00:26:24.73,00:26:24.73,  and he was pretty cocky.
734,00:26:26.33,00:26:26.33,"He was thinking he could go outand get something, came back in"
735,00:26:29.57,00:26:29.57,   with a sea urchin.
736,00:26:30.57,00:26:30.57, ( derisive chuckling )
737,00:26:32.53,00:26:32.53,"   But that was good,   that shows people"
738,00:26:33.97,00:26:33.97,  that he who thought he was a spear-fishing person
739,00:26:36.37,00:26:36.37,"  could go out there,   no problem,"
740,00:26:37.60,00:26:37.60,  comes from the other tribe
741,00:26:39.13,00:26:39.13,"  and came back in,    telling everybody"
742,00:26:40.70,00:26:40.70,   just how difficult it is--  that ups my value even more.
743,00:26:48.63,00:26:48.63," JENNA: Free in sight,less than 100 feet away"
744,00:26:51.83,00:26:51.83,"  and we have, like..."
745,00:26:53.33,00:26:53.33,"I've got this girl laid out in,   like, across the back seat"
746,00:26:55.93,00:26:55.93,"  of, like, a Suzuki Sidekick and it was, like, incredible."
747,00:26:59.27,00:26:59.27,Come on. Who canfollow that?
748,00:27:03.27,00:27:03.27,Not I.
749,00:27:03.27,00:27:03.27,Rich.
750,00:27:05.30,00:27:05.30,Rich can.
751,00:27:05.30,00:27:05.30,"Rich, yay."
752,00:27:07.10,00:27:07.10,"First night as one tribe  we sat around the campfire,"
753,00:27:10.27,00:27:10.27,"told stories-- very, very, very   revealing stories."
754,00:27:13.27,00:27:13.27, KELLY:Gretchen said she drank a fifth    of whiskey in two minutes
755,00:27:18.33,00:27:18.33, when she was 14
756,00:27:19.93,00:27:19.93," and I would have never guessed   that about her, you know?"
757,00:27:23.13,00:27:23.13,  Sounds like we kind of havea similar past.
758,00:27:25.83,00:27:25.83,"This new group is, like,  it's like a banquet."
759,00:27:30.37,00:27:30.37, It's like a banquet of storiesand excitement.
760,00:27:32.97,00:27:32.97,Sean leftan orgy opportunity.
761,00:27:34.93,00:27:34.93,"No, I left a two-on-oneopportunity. Two girls."
762,00:27:38.20,00:27:38.20,How come youleft it?
763,00:27:39.43,00:27:39.43,I was scaredout of my mind.
764,00:27:41.43,00:27:41.43, RUDY:  Some of the stuff they talk about don't interest me
765,00:27:43.83,00:27:43.83, and I don't want to hear it.
766,00:27:45.77,00:27:45.77, I don't know.
767,00:27:47.03,00:27:47.03, They talk about a lot of sex stuff.
768,00:27:49.60,00:27:49.60,  ( thunder crashing )
769,00:27:53.40,00:27:53.40,( rain pouring )
770,00:28:01.00,00:28:01.00," Wait, Rudy."
771,00:28:04.30,00:28:04.30,  You're going to be  good over there.
772,00:28:05.90,00:28:05.90,   GRETCHEN:  Keep your hands to yourself.
773,00:28:08.33,00:28:08.33, RUDY:   Everybody's hands  all over me.
774,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,"  Damn, Rudy."
775,00:28:25.23,00:28:25.23,   GRETCHEN:  It rained again last night
776,00:28:27.37,00:28:27.37, and we had to rebuild the roof
777,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,  of their shelter yesterday
778,00:28:31.43,00:28:31.43, and I think half of it  is leakproof
779,00:28:33.43,00:28:33.43," and half of it  doesn't have a roof,"
780,00:28:35.40,00:28:35.40,  and so a lot of us  got very wet.
781,00:28:37.03,00:28:37.03,And it's frustrating because we had just moved from a shelter
782,00:28:40.53,00:28:40.53, that we had worked outall the bugs in
783,00:28:42.27,00:28:42.27,  and kept us 90% dry.
784,00:28:45.97,00:28:45.97," RUDY:  I was in there last night   and, uh, when the rain came"
785,00:28:50.63,00:28:50.63, all them women   eased down our way
786,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,   and I had about five women   in my lap all of a sudden.
787,00:28:55.53,00:28:55.53,Rudy was kicking me in the head.He doesn't care.
788,00:28:57.57,00:28:57.57," JENNA: Oh, yeah, people were getting"
789,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,  kicked in the head all night long
790,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17, because he got out three times
791,00:29:01.47,00:29:01.47,and he would just barrelthrough people.
792,00:29:03.87,00:29:03.87," RUDY:  I mean, the pillows were    right across me,"
793,00:29:06.70,00:29:06.70,  and I had to get up  and go to the head
794,00:29:08.47,00:29:08.47,and I couldn't.
795,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50, I don't know.
796,00:29:11.10,00:29:11.10,"  Rudy kicked me in the head,  like, three times last night"
797,00:29:12.80,00:29:12.80,"  and I said,""Rudy, that's my head,"""
798,00:29:14.07,00:29:14.07," and he said, ""This ismy space, so..."""
799,00:29:15.47,00:29:15.47,"I said, ""Rudy,that's my head."""
800,00:29:16.70,00:29:16.70,"He goes, ""That's my spot."""
801,00:29:17.97,00:29:17.97,"  ""I got to get out.  It's my spot."""
802,00:29:18.97,00:29:18.97,That's what he said.
803,00:29:20.47,00:29:20.47,   Did you ask him   to draw the outlines?
804,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67," Hey, I'm the old guy, don't forget."
805,00:29:24.03,00:29:24.03,Them young guys  might have liked it.
806,00:29:26.23,00:29:26.23, It's a pain in the ass to me.
807,00:29:28.87,00:29:28.87,You do the honors.
808,00:29:30.33,00:29:30.33,"No, no, it'syours now."
809,00:29:31.97,00:29:31.97, ( both laugh )
810,00:29:33.40,00:29:33.40,   Hey! I guess it's   not in there
811,00:29:35.40,00:29:35.40, but this is different.
812,00:29:36.93,00:29:36.93,"""The next challenge,things couldn't be more fair."
813,00:29:40.77,00:29:40.77,"""Just take a deep breathand don't come up for air."

817,00:29:54.30,00:29:54.30,  I'm guessing
818,00:29:55.60,00:29:55.60,"it's a ""holding   your breath"" competition."
819,00:30:04.63,00:30:04.63,Welcome to Snake Island.
820,00:30:06.33,00:30:06.33,  Congratulations on survivingthe first phase.
821,00:30:08.57,00:30:08.57,  You guys have now all proven
822,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,that you can definitely  survive the island.
823,00:30:12.40,00:30:12.40, I don't think  that's in question.
824,00:30:13.83,00:30:13.83, You've been here three weeks;everybody's doing great.
825,00:30:16.53,00:30:16.53,  Now it's going to be about  who can survive each other.
826,00:30:19.33,00:30:19.33,   How well you guys survivetribal politics.
827,00:30:21.40,00:30:21.40,"We've replaced the immunity idol   with an immunity talisman,"
828,00:30:24.67,00:30:24.67, so you will wear this   around your neck.
829,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,That means that   at Tribal Council
830,00:30:27.70,00:30:27.70,   you cannot have any votes   cast against you.
831,00:30:29.43,00:30:29.43,   You will not be voted off.
832,00:30:31.70,00:30:31.70," You can, however, vote against others still,"
833,00:30:33.43,00:30:33.43,  so it's a great place to be.
834,00:30:34.93,00:30:34.93," This will go in the archives,this becomes the treasured icon."
835,00:30:39.43,00:30:39.43,   This is our first immunity   challenge as individuals.
836,00:30:41.57,00:30:41.57,   It's very simple.It's about holding your breath.
837,00:30:43.53,00:30:43.53,"  In the first round, all ten of you will go under the water"
838,00:30:46.83,00:30:46.83,  to hold your breath.
839,00:30:48.07,00:30:48.07,You'll each hold  onto a bar that will
840,00:30:50.63,00:30:50.63,help keep you submerged.
841,00:30:52.40,00:30:52.40,   The last three to surface   go on to the final round.
842,00:30:55.60,00:30:55.60,  Make sense?
843,00:30:57.90,00:30:57.90,  Head on in.
844,00:31:10.43,00:31:10.43,  ( laughing )
845,00:31:16.93,00:31:16.93,Survivors ready?
846,00:31:18.53,00:31:18.53,  Go!
847,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,( laughs )
848,00:32:03.77,00:32:03.77,  ( laughing )
849,00:32:07.23,00:32:07.23,Come up for air.
850,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,"Good job, Sue."
851,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,"Yeah, good job, Sue."
852,00:32:25.37,00:32:25.37,   I guess I had to come up.
853,00:32:45.20,00:32:45.20,( clock's second hand ticking )
854,00:33:11.80,00:33:11.80,   Yeah.
855,00:33:17.97,00:33:17.97,Yay!
856,00:33:20.33,00:33:20.33, Is he dead?
857,00:33:23.70,00:33:23.70, Everybody's up.
858,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,"   Come on, Gervase."
859,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,He doesn't knowif he should come up or not.
860,00:33:30.47,00:33:30.47,  ALL:  Yay!
861,00:33:36.33,00:33:36.33,"All right,Gervase!"
862,00:33:37.80,00:33:37.80,"  Sean, Gervase, Greg,you guys are moving on."
863,00:33:39.53,00:33:39.53,  The rest of you guyscan sit up here
864,00:33:41.47,00:33:41.47,  on the dock with me   and take a break.
865,00:33:49.57,00:33:49.57," JEFF:  Final round, this is it."
866,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,"  Still about  holding your breath,"
867,00:33:53.77,00:33:53.77,  but now we're adding speed.
868,00:33:56.13,00:33:56.13, We're going to swim out   to a buoy.
869,00:33:57.73,00:33:57.73, At the bottom   of the ocean floor
870,00:33:59.40,00:33:59.40,"  are three ladders,  one for each of you."
871,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,"You're going to use the ladders    to get momentum,"
872,00:34:03.93,00:34:03.93, and along the way are buoys.
873,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40," Yank hard, release the buoy."
874,00:34:07.30,00:34:07.30, First person    to the end of the course
875,00:34:08.93,00:34:08.93,that's releasedall their buoys gets immunity.
876,00:34:11.53,00:34:11.53,Very simple.
877,00:34:13.57,00:34:13.57,"  Use the ladder,  it's much quicker."
878,00:34:14.93,00:34:14.93,All right?
879,00:34:16.00,00:34:16.00,Head out toyour buoys.
880,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,I'll give you a start.
881,00:34:18.10,00:34:18.10,Good luck.
882,00:34:39.97,00:34:39.97,  Gervase! Greg! Sean!
883,00:34:42.33,00:34:42.33, This is for immunity--
884,00:34:44.60,00:34:44.60, the first individual immunity.
885,00:34:46.70,00:34:46.70,"   Win this,you cannot be voted off."
886,00:34:48.47,00:34:48.47,Survivors ready!
887,00:34:50.83,00:34:50.83,  Go!
888,00:35:34.23,00:35:34.23,Gervase!
889,00:35:35.53,00:35:35.53,"Close! Very close, Greg!"
890,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,( cheering )
891,00:35:41.23,00:35:41.23,"You all right, Gervase?"
892,00:35:43.30,00:35:43.30,"  Never swam like thatin my life, man."
893,00:35:45.80,00:35:45.80,"  Towards the very end, he  was a smidgen ahead of me,"
894,00:35:49.33,00:35:49.33,"and no matterwhat I did,"
895,00:35:50.97,00:35:50.97, we were right at each other.
896,00:35:52.77,00:35:52.77,Feel like Miss America?
897,00:35:54.57,00:35:54.57,"  It's all you, man,  it's all you."
898,00:36:21.87,00:36:21.87,"RICHARD:  But even though we aren'tany longer two different teams,"
899,00:36:26.67,00:36:26.67, I still have a team.
900,00:36:28.23,00:36:28.23,  It's going to be interestingbecause we're not solid.
901,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33," We're solid with one another,"
902,00:36:32.23,00:36:32.23, but we're not solidly unbeatable yet
903,00:36:35.40,00:36:35.40," just by circumstance, because    there are only four of us"
904,00:36:37.97,00:36:37.97,  and there are ten people    still left on the island.
905,00:36:41.37,00:36:41.37, KELLY: When you get in that Tribal Council
906,00:36:42.87,00:36:42.87,  and you walk up and you see  that little piece of paper
907,00:36:45.20,00:36:45.20, and the thing that you   put the vote in--
908,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,  it's all different.
909,00:36:49.73,00:36:49.73," You know, you might...you might have a thought"
910,00:36:52.93,00:36:52.93," and say, ""Hey, I really don't want to vote this person off."""
911,00:36:56.13,00:36:56.13,  It's easier said than done.
912,00:36:57.87,00:36:57.87,  An alliance    is easier said than done.
913,00:36:59.83,00:36:59.83, GREG:  If people are fear-and self-preservation-motivated
914,00:37:02.67,00:37:02.67," they'll band together, they'll form alliances,"
915,00:37:04.97,00:37:04.97, they'll start   beating people out
916,00:37:06.57,00:37:06.57,  to try and get rid   of the strong ones
917,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47," and get rid of this  and get rid of that,"
918,00:37:10.10,00:37:10.10,"   and, uh, you know,if that happens"
919,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,I hope they vote me off  really soon
920,00:37:13.30,00:37:13.30,"  because, uh, that to me is--"
921,00:37:15.83,00:37:15.83,"whoa, cool flying fish--"
922,00:37:18.13,00:37:18.13,  that to me is really boring.
923,00:37:22.07,00:37:22.07," JENNA:  Coming into this merger, I consider it a brand-new tribe."
924,00:37:24.80,00:37:24.80, I want a vote    based on people's merits.
925,00:37:28.13,00:37:28.13, I don't want a vote based on
926,00:37:29.60,00:37:29.60," ""Let's get rid of each of them first"
927,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,"and then come back to our tribe."""
928,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,"I... I want a vote based on, uh, who I really think should go,"
929,00:37:36.27,00:37:36.27, whether it be a member of our  tribe or a member of theirs.
930,00:37:52.23,00:37:52.23,"   All right, welcome to"
931,00:37:54.00,00:37:54.00,"  your first, uh, Tribal  Council as Rattana."
932,00:37:56.27,00:37:56.27,  Doesn't change  the rules.
933,00:37:58.10,00:37:58.10,  Doesn't change  anything here.
934,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,"   This is still   where you account   for your actions,"
935,00:38:01.40,00:38:01.40,"good or bad,"
936,00:38:02.83,00:38:02.83,"and, uh, by theend of the night"
937,00:38:04.87,00:38:04.87,   one of you will be   voted off the island.
938,00:38:06.73,00:38:06.73,   So let's talk   about the actions
939,00:38:08.43,00:38:08.43, of the past few days.
940,00:38:09.50,00:38:09.50,Been a busy few dayswith the merger.
941,00:38:11.30,00:38:11.30,"   Richard, with the   rules changing"
942,00:38:12.73,00:38:12.73,  how has that changed   the group dynamic?
943,00:38:16.07,00:38:16.07,"   You know,I really haven't noticed"
944,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,much of a change  in the dynamic at all. Um...
945,00:38:20.53,00:38:20.53,"  we still seem to just get  along really, really well."
946,00:38:23.43,00:38:23.43,   There's only been two days together as two teams
947,00:38:26.50,00:38:26.50,"so there isn't, uh, really time  for conflict to develop yet."
948,00:38:30.77,00:38:30.77,"Gretchen, is it   too soon to think"
949,00:38:32.87,00:38:32.87,  that strategies might shift?
950,00:38:34.97,00:38:34.97,"   Oh, I think people who arestrategically playing the game,"
951,00:38:38.57,00:38:38.57," um, you know, strategy has changed for them."
952,00:38:41.53,00:38:41.53,How so?
953,00:38:43.03,00:38:43.03,"Well, from who's strongestin your tribe to keep,"
954,00:38:45.50,00:38:45.50,now who's strongestin this one tribe to get rid of
955,00:38:48.37,00:38:48.37, 'cause they're   your biggest competition.
956,00:38:50.50,00:38:50.50,"Sean, aside from the physical--"
957,00:38:52.20,00:38:52.20,"who you want to hangout with, who youlike being around--"
958,00:38:54.60,00:38:54.60,how big a factor is that
959,00:38:55.77,00:38:55.77,now going to playin who you vote for?
960,00:38:57.50,00:38:57.50,"Well, for me it's still   a very big factor."
961,00:38:59.40,00:38:59.40, I think there's a lot of room in a group of ten to not think
962,00:39:02.73,00:39:02.73, ultra-strategically just yet.
963,00:39:04.87,00:39:04.87,In talking to my tribe
964,00:39:06.07,00:39:06.07,and talking to their tribeas the ambassador
965,00:39:07.73,00:39:07.73,I think that most peopleare very concerned
966,00:39:09.73,00:39:09.73,"about alliances,just having"
967,00:39:11.87,00:39:11.87," a Tagi versus Pagong internalbloodbath, you know, and"
968,00:39:13.63,00:39:13.63,it's a--
969,00:39:15.47,00:39:15.47,"   yeah, that's a good word--"
970,00:39:16.80,00:39:16.80," but, uh, I don't think that's going to occur."
971,00:39:19.13,00:39:19.13, The rain is really coming downall of a sudden.
972,00:39:21.23,00:39:21.23," All right, the only person for whom"
973,00:39:23.83,00:39:23.83,  this does not really factor  in tonight is Greg.
974,00:39:26.77,00:39:26.77, You cannot vote for Greg.
975,00:39:28.37,00:39:28.37,"  He however,  can still vote"
976,00:39:29.90,00:39:29.90," for you, and will votefor one of you."
977,00:39:33.53,00:39:33.53," So with that,"
978,00:39:34.70,00:39:34.70,  it's time to vote.
979,00:39:36.20,00:39:36.20,"  Greg, you're up first."
980,00:39:52.73,00:39:52.73,"  Either be here, or be gone."
981,00:40:11.67,00:40:11.67,  I'm voting for Rudy.
982,00:40:13.10,00:40:13.10," He's probably the person that I respect most in the tribe,"
983,00:40:16.50,00:40:16.50, but the person I least want to play the game with.
984,00:40:28.30,00:40:28.30, Overconfident.
985,00:40:41.87,00:40:41.87,  Moo.
986,00:40:49.83,00:40:49.83,   I am not really employing any strategy.
987,00:40:52.63,00:40:52.63, I'm voting for Colleen today.
988,00:40:54.57,00:40:54.57,"I love her, she's cute,  adorable and nice to look at"
989,00:40:57.23,00:40:57.23,"and fun tohave around,"
990,00:40:58.90,00:40:58.90, but she's the first in a long list
991,00:41:01.10,00:41:01.10,   of alphabetical order
992,00:41:02.57,00:41:02.57,   and she won't get  another vote from me
993,00:41:04.27,00:41:04.27,unless she pisses me off or something.
994,00:41:06.27,00:41:06.27,"But it's her turn today,   being the first..."
995,00:41:07.67,00:41:07.67,  alphabetical order.
996,00:41:12.07,00:41:12.07, JEFF:Directly across from you  are the six torches
997,00:41:15.80,00:41:15.80,   representing the first six   people voted off.
998,00:41:17.47,00:41:17.47,"  Tonight, one of your torches  will be added to that group."
999,00:41:20.60,00:41:20.60,I'll go tally the votes.

1022,00:43:44.23,00:43:44.23,"  is any indication,"
1023,00:43:45.63,00:43:45.63, the stakes have definitely been raised.
1024,00:43:48.30,00:43:48.30,You guys can head back to camp.
1025,00:43:50.33,00:43:50.33,I'll see youtomorrow.
1026,00:44:06.93,00:44:06.93,  Next week on Survivor...
1027,00:44:08.43,00:44:08.43,  Greg cuts his play kitten Colleen loose.
1028,00:44:10.57,00:44:10.57, You look right in the kitten's eye and snap its neck.
1029,00:44:12.67,00:44:12.67, It's nothing personal; you're hungry.
1030,00:44:14.10,00:44:14.10,  And makes a move on Rich.
1031,00:44:15.60,00:44:15.60, RICH: He's trying something. That's great.
1032,00:44:18.13,00:44:18.13, Tagi continues to plot.
1033,00:44:19.77,00:44:19.77,"   Then it's their team,   one by one by one."
1034,00:44:21.93,00:44:21.93, And things aren't great   for Jenna.
1035,00:44:23.30,00:44:23.30,  I miss my beauties.
1036,00:44:24.77,00:44:24.77,   Now it seems like she wants to leave the island.
1037,00:44:32.37,00:44:32.37,I would hope thatit was because
1038,00:44:33.63,00:44:33.63," they felt that I was a threat,"
1039,00:44:35.37,00:44:35.37," unless, you know, people had a conflict with me"
1040,00:44:37.20,00:44:37.20, and didn't ever voice it--
1041,00:44:38.73,00:44:38.73, which I do think is kind of an injustice.
1042,00:44:42.27,00:44:42.27, And I would hope
1043,00:44:44.07,00:44:44.07, that if somebody had a problem with me
1044,00:44:45.47,00:44:45.47," they would say it. So, you know, I can hope that,"
1045,00:44:47.10,00:44:47.10,but I won't knowuntil I watch the show.
1046,00:44:48.87,00:44:48.87,I can hope thatit was because
1047,00:44:49.87,00:44:49.87,they thoughtI was a threat.
1048,00:44:50.87,00:44:50.87,That would make me feel good.
