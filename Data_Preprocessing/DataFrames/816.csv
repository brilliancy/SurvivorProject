31,00:01:44.83,00:01:44.83,mother. >> Due to someone

51,00:03:10.33,00:03:10.33,the Chapera Tribe proved to be the powerhouse at the
52,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,challenges. And Rupert and Jenna joined Rob
53,00:03:18.33,00:03:18.33,and Amber in an alliance of four.
54,00:03:20.96,00:03:20.96,">> Once it gets to the final four, then we can... we"

66,00:04:06.25,00:04:06.25,"The tribe has spoken. At Chapera, strategy turned into"
67,00:04:12.12,00:04:12.12,romance for Rob and Amber. >> Flirting was a huge
68,00:04:16.29,00:04:16.29,"strategy in the beginning, but then I got caught up in it, and"
69,00:04:19.17,00:04:19.17,"feelings, you know, emerged. >> Amber and I have been fooling"
70,00:04:23.62,00:04:23.62,around a little bit out here. I'm definitely attracted to her.
71,00:04:27.46,00:04:27.46,It would be nice to have a million dollars and take the

73,00:04:33.50,00:04:33.50,"was hit with a big surprise. All right, drop your buffs."
74,00:04:36.83,00:04:36.83,>> ( groans ) >> PROBST: It was a tribal
75,00:04:38.96,00:04:38.96,"shuffle. Boston Rob, you don't look"
76,00:04:40.96,00:04:40.96,"pleased at all. Against all odds, the tribes"
77,00:04:43.33,00:04:43.33,"remain the same, merely switching beaches and tribe"
78,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,"names. Except for Amber, who remained"
79,00:04:49.50,00:04:49.50,at Chapera and became the only all-star to find herself with
80,00:04:52.79,00:04:52.79,new tribe mates. >> This is crazy.
81,00:04:56.21,00:04:56.21,>> PROBST: She was suddenly alone and vulnerable in her own
82,00:04:58.46,00:04:58.46,camp. >> I definitely feel like
83,00:05:01.08,00:05:01.08,I'm the one who got screwed in this whole situation.
84,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,>> I don't really care that the other team has our
85,00:05:08.50,00:05:08.50,camp. What aggravates me is they got
86,00:05:10.71,00:05:10.71,my girl over there. >> PROBST: When the new Mogo
87,00:05:13.25,00:05:13.25,"Mogo tribe won the next immunity challenge, Rob approached Lex"
88,00:05:16.38,00:05:16.38,and made a daring plea to save Amber.
89,00:05:22.00,00:05:22.00,">> If you can, if you can."
90,00:05:23.83,00:05:23.83,>> PROBST: And Amber made her own plea to Kathy.
91,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,">> Please, Kathy, keep me in the game."
92,00:05:29.67,00:05:29.67,"Vote for Jerri-- please. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
93,00:05:34.50,00:05:34.50,Lex and Kathy came through. They granted Rob the favor and
94,00:05:38.17,00:05:38.17,spared Amber. Ninth person voted out of
95,00:05:40.92,00:05:40.92,Survivor: All-Stars... Jerri.
96,00:05:43.17,00:05:43.17,"And Jerri paid the price. On day 26, the two tribes"
97,00:05:51.71,00:05:51.71,finally merged. ( cheering )
98,00:05:55.08,00:05:55.08,"At the new Chaboga Mogo tribe, Lex looked for reassurance"
99,00:05:58.83,00:05:58.83,"from Rob. >> If I get a sense that,"
100,00:06:00.79,00:06:00.79,"you know, I'm going to end up getting the, you know, double"
101,00:06:03.62,00:06:03.62,"crossing, a knife in my back next Tribal Council."
102,00:06:05.33,00:06:05.33,I certainly won't be happy about that.
103,00:06:06.62,00:06:06.62,">> I won't stick a knife in your back, man."
104,00:06:10.21,00:06:10.21,"I ain't gonna do that. What, ""Make me a deal,"
105,00:06:12.42,00:06:12.42,"save Amber and I'm help you later on""?"
106,00:06:14.33,00:06:14.33,"You guys didn't really believe that, did you?"
107,00:06:16.71,00:06:16.71,>> PROBST: Rob confronted Lex and told him the deal was off.

109,00:06:24.00,00:06:24.00,"was that if I can take care of you, I will."
110,00:06:26.50,00:06:26.50,I'm sorry I cannot. >> You have more allegiance
111,00:06:29.33,00:06:29.33,to them than you got to me. You're breaking my heart.
112,00:06:31.33,00:06:31.33,"I can't, I can't even believe it."
113,00:06:35.38,00:06:35.38,>> PROBST: The strategic favor had backfired and Lex was
114,00:06:38.71,00:06:38.71,voted out... making him the first member of
115,00:06:43.71,00:06:43.71,the jury. Kathy was the next to join the
116,00:06:46.67,00:06:46.67,jury. Then Alicia and Shii Ann.
117,00:06:51.67,00:06:51.67,"Last week, the five remaining members of Chaboga Mogo"
118,00:06:54.92,00:06:54.92,competed for a car at the reward challenge.
119,00:06:57.46,00:06:57.46,Rob won and chose to take Amber with him to an island
120,00:07:00.83,00:07:00.83,"drive-in movie. When they arrived, things got"
121,00:07:04.12,00:07:04.12,even better for Amber. One of the added benefits of
122,00:07:07.33,00:07:07.33,"being selected by Boston Rob: Something for you, Amber."
123,00:07:09.71,00:07:09.71,>> Are you serious?! >> PROBST: The two kicked back
124,00:07:13.17,00:07:13.17,and enjoyed the movie and their first romantic date.
125,00:07:17.04,00:07:17.04,"Upon returning to camp, Amber told the others about her new"
126,00:07:20.17,00:07:20.17,car. >> I had the choice
127,00:07:21.50,00:07:21.50,"whether or not to tell people, but I felt that holding that"
128,00:07:24.71,00:07:24.71,back from them just wasn't me. >> PROBST: And Rupert and Tom
129,00:07:28.25,00:07:28.25,had had enough of the power couple.
130,00:07:31.33,00:07:31.33,>> Take that damn couple and and break that couple apart.
131,00:07:34.00,00:07:34.00,"If I get Tom in with Jenna and I, we three would put Rob and"
132,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,"Amber out of this game. >> PROBST: But Rob, sensing"
133,00:07:40.75,00:07:40.75,"trouble, orchestrated a fight between Rupert and Tom."

135,00:07:46.62,00:07:46.62,"to vote me out. >> If he tells you that,"
136,00:07:48.21,00:07:48.21,then he's a lying son of a bitch.
137,00:07:49.96,00:07:49.96,">> You've been talking about getting rid of everybody,"
138,00:07:52.17,00:07:52.17,Tom. Behind everybody's back.
139,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,And now I'm the bad guy? >> The reason that I did
140,00:07:57.29,00:07:57.29,this was to get them at each other's throats so that
141,00:07:59.88,00:07:59.88,neither of them will have enough sense to try to get me
142,00:08:03.17,00:08:03.17,and Amber off. >> PROBST: At the Immunity

144,00:08:09.25,00:08:09.25,Boston Rob wins immunity. But he was worried about Amber
145,00:08:13.33,00:08:13.33,being outnumbered. >> The only way I don't
146,00:08:15.67,00:08:15.67,"hold the power is if Rupert, Jenna and Big Tom all team up"
147,00:08:18.62,00:08:18.62,and vote Amber off. >> PROBST: Rob and Amber looked
148,00:08:21.79,00:08:21.79,for reassurance from Big Tom. >> Why would you think I
149,00:08:24.71,00:08:24.71,want with Rupert and Jenna? >> I don't know.
150,00:08:26.71,00:08:26.71,"Why have you been feeding them stuff for the last two weeks,"
151,00:08:28.71,00:08:28.71,telling them you want to get rid of me?
152,00:08:30.25,00:08:30.25,">> Let's make up our mind, 'cause what you tell me,"
153,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,that's what I'm putting on that card.

155,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,>> PROBST: The deal was made to vote Jenna out.
156,00:08:40.50,00:08:40.50,"But at Tribal Council, Big Tom was betrayed."

192,00:12:11.58,00:12:11.58,>> I got a little nervous at first.
193,00:12:14.58,00:12:14.58,"I was thinking maybe, oh, gosh, this is our challenge."
194,00:12:16.58,00:12:16.58,What are we going to have to do? >> PROBST: I brought you guys
195,00:12:19.62,00:12:19.62,gifts fitting for a final four. Let me show you.
196,00:12:23.29,00:12:23.29,( all cheering ) You've got everything you need
197,00:12:28.88,00:12:28.88,"for bacon, eggs, pancakes... ( Rob cheering )"
198,00:12:32.96,00:12:32.96,">> Pancakes! >> PROBST: Fresh fruit,"
199,00:12:36.38,00:12:36.38,"orange juice, champagne for mimosas."
200,00:12:40.04,00:12:40.04,">> Champagne! >> PROBST: In addition, the top"
201,00:12:44.00,00:12:44.00,"of this is also a scrapbook. So, you have a camera."
202,00:12:49.58,00:12:49.58,"You can take pictures during the day, make up your scrapbook."
203,00:12:53.46,00:12:53.46,">> Oh, wow. >> PROBST: Have a good time."
204,00:12:56.67,00:12:56.67,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: You're welcome.
205,00:12:59.42,00:12:59.42,Enjoy! >> Breakfast is my
206,00:13:02.83,00:13:02.83,favorite meal of the day. So this meal is huge out here.
207,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,">> Guys, we made it 37 days. Whatever happens tonight"
208,00:13:14.33,00:13:14.33,"happens, and good luck to everybody."
209,00:13:17.04,00:13:17.04,>> Good luck to us all. >> Cheers.
210,00:13:18.83,00:13:18.83,>> Cheers. The four people that are
211,00:13:21.79,00:13:21.79,in the final four are two distinct groups of two.
212,00:13:26.38,00:13:26.38,There's no chance myself and Amber are going to break.
213,00:13:28.50,00:13:28.50,I think it's a toss-up: Jenna may turn on Rupert.
214,00:13:32.29,00:13:32.29,It may come down to a purple rock.
215,00:13:35.46,00:13:35.46,>> I've been thinking about this whole purple rock
216,00:13:38.62,00:13:38.62,"thing. >> So far, like, the game"
217,00:13:41.83,00:13:41.83,has gone so well for all of us. >> Yeah.
218,00:13:44.38,00:13:44.38,I'm very concerned with the tie- breaker situation.
219,00:13:47.50,00:13:47.50,What would happen is whoever has immunity has immunity.
220,00:13:50.21,00:13:50.21,And then the other three have to reach into a bag-- there's two
221,00:13:53.67,00:13:53.67,white rocks and one purple one. The person who gets the purple
222,00:13:56.71,00:13:56.71,rock is out of the game. I don't want it to come to a
223,00:13:59.25,00:13:59.25,frickin' rock. >> I know.
224,00:14:01.00,00:14:01.00,>> That's not what we played for.
225,00:14:02.67,00:14:02.67,>> We knew it was going to come down to a purple rock.
226,00:14:04.96,00:14:04.96,So we gave her the option of voting out Rupert tonight.
227,00:14:08.29,00:14:08.29,">> Well, you guys just keep up your end and vote Rupert."
228,00:14:10.67,00:14:10.67,">> We will. >> Strategically, I"
229,00:14:12.58,00:14:12.58,came out here to win. And this is the way to do it for
230,00:14:14.83,00:14:14.83,me; it gets me one step closer. I didn't come 37 days to reach
231,00:14:18.92,00:14:18.92,into a bag and let a color decide my fate.
232,00:14:22.79,00:14:22.79,So I'm taking fate in my own hands.
233,00:14:26.04,00:14:26.04,">> Is that breakfast I smell? >> Yes, ma'am!"
234,00:14:29.83,00:14:29.83,>> All I've been craving is a pancake.
235,00:14:33.17,00:14:33.17,"It was the... I, like, ate tiny little bites."
236,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,"It's better than I have at home. Oh, my God!"
237,00:14:40.58,00:14:40.58,>> Mm. >> This morning's breakfast is
238,00:14:43.00,00:14:43.00,good-bye to one of us. Somebody is leaving tonight.
239,00:14:49.12,00:14:49.12,"Boy, I hope it's not me. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
240,00:15:06.54,00:15:06.54,"to today's immunity challenge. Boston Rob, give it up."
241,00:15:14.42,00:15:14.42,"Immunity, back up for grabs. For today's immunity challenge,"
242,00:15:18.38,00:15:18.38,we have constructed a giant maze.
243,00:15:21.21,00:15:21.21,"On my go, you will race from the center of the maze to eight"
244,00:15:24.12,00:15:24.12,different points within the maze.
245,00:15:26.17,00:15:26.17,"At each point, you'll find a ladder rung."
246,00:15:28.33,00:15:28.33,"Untie it, bring it back to the center."
247,00:15:30.67,00:15:30.67,"Along the way, you're going to encounter various obstacles"
248,00:15:33.33,00:15:33.33,blocking your path. And you're going see the same
249,00:15:35.50,00:15:35.50,obstacle more than once. The trick is don't get confused.
250,00:15:39.29,00:15:39.29,"Once you've gathered all eight, you'll assemble your ladder,"
251,00:15:41.92,00:15:41.92,climb to the top of the tower. First person to the top of the
252,00:15:44.54,00:15:44.54,tower wins. Make sense?
253,00:15:46.83,00:15:46.83,We'll draw colors. Wait for my go.
254,00:15:52.46,00:15:52.46,"Here we go, guys. For immunity and a guaranteed"
255,00:15:55.75,00:15:55.75,spot in the Final Three. Survivors ready...
256,00:15:58.00,00:15:58.00,Go! Everybody off.
257,00:16:01.79,00:16:01.79,Jenna hits a dead-end. Boston Rob working on the
258,00:16:07.83,00:16:07.83,crawl-through. Amber out of the other
259,00:16:10.21,00:16:10.21,crawl-through. Rupert makes his way through the
260,00:16:15.00,00:16:15.00,ropes Amber finds her first rung.
261,00:16:17.25,00:16:17.25,"Jenna working her way through the ropes, getting tangled up."
262,00:16:21.50,00:16:21.50,Boston Rob has his first rung. Rupert finds his first rung.
263,00:16:27.75,00:16:27.75,Amber still making her way back to the center with her first
264,00:16:30.67,00:16:30.67,rung. Jenna untying her first rung.
265,00:16:33.58,00:16:33.58,Boston Rob has his first rung. Amber's in with one.
266,00:16:38.83,00:16:38.83,Rupert's in with one. Everybody has one except Jenna.
267,00:16:46.67,00:16:46.67,Jenna with her first. Everybody has one rung.
268,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,Rob and Amber going through the ropes together.
269,00:16:53.67,00:16:53.67,Jenna making her way through the walk-through.
270,00:16:57.04,00:16:57.04,Amber and Rob both getting a second rung.
271,00:17:00.25,00:17:00.25,"Jenna has her second rung. Rob passes Amber in the ropes,"
272,00:17:08.54,00:17:08.54,"Jenna's back with her second, Rupert's back with his second."
273,00:17:11.00,00:17:11.00,"Boston Rob back with his second, and Amber back with her second."
274,00:17:14.25,00:17:14.25,"We're tied up, two rungs each. Looking for a total of eight."
275,00:17:23.92,00:17:23.92,Rob on his third rung. Jenna untying her third rung.
276,00:17:29.00,00:17:29.00,She's got to get back to the center.
277,00:17:30.83,00:17:30.83,Boston Rob back with his third rung.
278,00:17:32.58,00:17:32.58,Jenna with a third rung. Amber with a third rung.
279,00:17:44.88,00:17:44.88,"Rupert back with a third rung. We're tied up, everybody has"
280,00:17:47.50,00:17:47.50,three rungs. Boston Rob with four rungs.
281,00:17:54.71,00:17:54.71,Jenna with four rungs. Amber with four rungs.
282,00:17:57.96,00:17:57.96,Rupert with four rungs. Everybody tied up.
283,00:18:06.04,00:18:06.04,Boston Rob quietly sneaks in with his fifth rung.
284,00:18:09.67,00:18:09.67,He's got a lead. Jenna with her fifth rung.
285,00:18:15.08,00:18:15.08,Boston Rob back in the center. Amber with her fifth rung.
286,00:18:20.42,00:18:20.42,"We're all tied up, five rungs. Boston Rob going in circles."
287,00:18:30.58,00:18:30.58,Rupert untying his sixth rung. Got to get back to the center.
288,00:18:35.83,00:18:35.83,"Amber with her sixth rung, Boston Rob coming back the other"
289,00:18:39.54,00:18:39.54,way now. Still going in circles.
290,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,Rupert closing the gap with his sixth rung.
291,00:18:52.71,00:18:52.71,Jenna back with her sixth rung. Boston Rob back with his sixth
292,00:18:56.83,00:18:56.83,rung. Amber with her seventh.
293,00:18:59.38,00:18:59.38,"Amber needs only one more rung. Rupert with seven, looking for"
294,00:19:02.88,00:19:02.88,his last rung. Amber on her way back with her
295,00:19:13.83,00:19:13.83,last rung. Rupert untying his.
296,00:19:18.50,00:19:18.50,Rob back with his seventh. Amber has all eight pieces.

298,00:19:32.21,00:19:32.21,Three pieces. She's got her fourth piece.
299,00:19:37.54,00:19:37.54,Fifth. Amber very close.
300,00:19:43.50,00:19:43.50,"Climbing the ladder. And with that, Amber wins"
301,00:19:47.62,00:19:47.62,immunity! Guaranteed final three!
302,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,"Amber, come on down. Put this on."
303,00:20:05.00,00:20:05.00,"Boy, when you needed it, you got it. Nicely done."
304,00:20:09.54,00:20:09.54,">> Oh, my gosh. >> PROBST: You are safe tonight"
305,00:20:12.00,00:20:12.00,at Tribal Council. >> I've never worn this before.
306,00:20:15.17,00:20:15.17,">> PROBST: Looks good. >> I think so, too."
307,00:20:17.33,00:20:17.33,>> PROBST: Amber is safe at the vote tonight.
308,00:20:19.38,00:20:19.38,The other three of you are not. Somebody is about to go home.
309,00:20:22.75,00:20:22.75,You have the afternoon to figure that out.
310,00:20:24.71,00:20:24.71,I'll see you at Tribal. Head on out.
311,00:20:55.67,00:20:55.67,>> You vote for Rob  and see what happens.
312,00:20:58.46,00:20:58.46,">> Yeah, I got something I want to talk to you about."
313,00:21:00.96,00:21:00.96,>> What do you want to talk to me about?
314,00:21:03.38,00:21:03.38,>> He came to me last night and said there's no way
315,00:21:06.29,00:21:06.29,"they're going to vote for each other, ""So, Jenna, why don't you"
316,00:21:09.79,00:21:09.79,"take your chances and vote Rupert?"""
317,00:21:12.33,00:21:12.33,"I debated it, kept throwing the idea around, and I'm not."
318,00:21:19.38,00:21:19.38,I can't do it. I'd rather sit there and pick a
319,00:21:23.17,00:21:23.17,rock than give than give them the smug satisfaction of knowing
320,00:21:26.92,00:21:26.92,that they're guaranteed a spot. >> My fate rests on the
321,00:21:33.17,00:21:33.17,"honor of the 26-year-old single mama who really, really wants to"
322,00:21:36.67,00:21:36.67,win badly. >> So how is everything
323,00:21:42.00,00:21:42.00,going to go down tonight? Have you decided?
324,00:21:45.33,00:21:45.33,">> No. >> Obviously, I have a"
325,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50,"vested interest in it. But, I mean, you can't be..."
326,00:21:50.50,00:21:50.50,>> And that's why it might be worth it for me to
327,00:21:53.33,00:21:53.33,choose a rock and then you're out and it's me that's in.
328,00:21:56.75,00:21:56.75,">> Maybe you, too. >> Exactly."
329,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,">> Well, to me, that's ridiculous..."
330,00:22:01.04,00:22:01.04,>> Because you won't do it against her.
331,00:22:02.50,00:22:02.50,That's my point. >> There's a possibility
332,00:22:05.17,00:22:05.17,I could beat her. There's no possibility I can
333,00:22:06.83,00:22:06.83,beat Rupert. There's no possibility you can
334,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,beat Rupert. >> I disagree.
335,00:22:09.83,00:22:09.83,I disagree. >> It's the difference
336,00:22:11.33,00:22:11.33,between maybe winning the million or a 30% shot at maybe
337,00:22:14.33,00:22:14.33,going home. >> Now I don't know.
338,00:22:18.00,00:22:18.00,I'm not letting Rob push me into anything.
339,00:22:20.17,00:22:20.17,"But there is truth. I mean, I would be in the final"
340,00:22:23.33,00:22:23.33,three. I might even be able to
341,00:22:25.67,00:22:25.67,"beat them, and then I've got a million dollars."
342,00:22:27.75,00:22:27.75,>> Let's go spend some time together.
343,00:22:30.08,00:22:30.08,This might be my last day here. >> Don't be sad.
344,00:22:34.54,00:22:34.54,"Yesterday, you're all feeling confident..."
345,00:22:36.79,00:22:36.79,">> Nah, I am. I'm totally fine with it."
346,00:22:38.75,00:22:38.75,">> ...today, you're not. >> It's out of my hands."
347,00:22:40.92,00:22:40.92,"There's nothing I can do about it, so I'm not going to worry"
348,00:22:42.83,00:22:42.83,"about it, you know? >> Yeah."
349,00:22:45.96,00:22:45.96,">> If I do go tonight, you'd better win."
350,00:22:48.67,00:22:48.67,You'd better. You'd better. >> I want you to come
351,00:22:52.83,00:22:52.83,with me. >> This is so good.
352,00:23:05.58,00:23:05.58,The decision is still a little up in the air... to be honest.
353,00:23:10.54,00:23:10.54,">> I can't see Jenna going against me, and I don't"
354,00:23:12.79,00:23:12.79,want to go against Jenna. She's just a little paranoid.
355,00:23:15.58,00:23:15.58,You got to let her alone. She's just a young girl.
356,00:23:17.50,00:23:17.50,"She's fine. Either way, I appreciate it."
357,00:23:20.67,00:23:20.67,>> I know. >> I believe that she
358,00:23:23.67,00:23:23.67,will write Rob's name down. >> At the beginning of
359,00:23:26.33,00:23:26.33,"this game, Jenna would say... ""Don't let emotional attachment"
360,00:23:30.88,00:23:30.88,"get in the way of your strategic survival game."""
361,00:23:33.33,00:23:33.33,What about you? >> My emotions control
362,00:23:36.92,00:23:36.92,what I do. In this game or out of this
363,00:23:39.96,00:23:39.96,"game, that's all I got is who I am."
364,00:23:42.83,00:23:42.83,>> Rupert's a very smart player. I give him a lot of credit.
365,00:23:46.42,00:23:46.42,He's probably conned Jenna into feeling bad about doing anything
366,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,but pulling a rock. >> I've never been in
367,00:23:57.00,00:23:57.00,so much turmoil in my life. I have the power tonight.
368,00:24:00.08,00:24:00.08,I really don't know what I'm going to do... until I get to
369,00:24:02.67,00:24:02.67,"tribal council. It's really, really a tough"
370,00:24:05.17,00:24:05.17,"decision. >> PROBST: Now, bring in the"
371,00:24:32.00,00:24:32.00,"members of our jury: Lex, Kathy, Alicia, Shii Ann..."
372,00:24:37.96,00:24:37.96,Big Tom voted out the last Tribal Council.
373,00:24:46.12,00:24:46.12,"So, let's get right into it. At the last Tribal Council, Big"
374,00:24:49.96,00:24:49.96,Tom clearly blindsided. Jury reaction was pretty strong.
375,00:24:53.83,00:24:53.83,"Did you see it, Jenna? >> Of course I did."
376,00:24:56.12,00:24:56.12,">> PROBST: Did it put anything through your head, because the"
377,00:24:57.75,00:24:57.75,power's clearly shifted now. >> Of course.
378,00:25:00.88,00:25:00.88,These are people that we have voted out.
379,00:25:03.00,00:25:03.00,"Facing them is traumatic, every single time we come here."
380,00:25:07.42,00:25:07.42,">> PROBST: Clearly, Big Tom had no idea that he was about to go."
381,00:25:11.21,00:25:11.21,"Boston Rob, here we are, we're down to a Final Five situation"
382,00:25:14.83,00:25:14.83,"and you betray somebody again, knowing you need them to get the"
383,00:25:17.17,00:25:17.17,"money. >> All I can say, Jeff,"
384,00:25:20.67,00:25:20.67,is there's two sides to every story.
385,00:25:23.58,00:25:23.58,And I say that with 100% conviction.
386,00:25:29.62,00:25:29.62,">> PROBST: Amber, make the argument that ""It's not fair to"
387,00:25:33.33,00:25:33.33,"judge me because I voted you out."""
388,00:25:35.25,00:25:35.25,"That is part of the game. >> In Australia, I had an"
389,00:25:38.88,00:25:38.88,"alliance, um... or what I thought was an alliance,"
390,00:25:42.12,00:25:42.12,"and I was somewhat blindsided. But when it came down to it, I"
391,00:25:46.04,00:25:46.04,actually end up voting for the person who broke their alliance
392,00:25:48.83,00:25:48.83,with me. And it was really hard for me to
393,00:25:52.33,00:25:52.33,"cast that vote because they hurt my feelings, but then I also had"
394,00:25:55.50,00:25:55.50,to remember that I'm playing the game of Survivor and it's
395,00:25:58.17,00:25:58.17,"""outwit, outplay, outlast,"" and I felt that that person truly"
396,00:26:01.33,00:26:01.33,"outwitted me. >> PROBST: And it seems to me,"
397,00:26:03.83,00:26:03.83,"with each successive Tribal Council, the emotional wear and"
398,00:26:07.62,00:26:07.62,"tear on you guys increases. Rupert, you and Jenna have been"
399,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,pretty tight. There's no mystery that Boston
400,00:26:13.25,00:26:13.25,"Rob and Amber have been pretty tight, but there's always been"
401,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,somebody else to vote out. It's not the case anymore.
402,00:26:19.04,00:26:19.04,>> Today was a very tough day.
403,00:26:22.29,00:26:22.29,It was very high and very low. Coming home without the necklace
404,00:26:27.75,00:26:27.75,"and then being told that the game might be changing for you,"
405,00:26:31.62,00:26:31.62,"those were pretty big lows. >> PROBST: Jenna, fill in the"
406,00:26:36.42,00:26:36.42,blanks for me. Because what Rupert is saying is
407,00:26:39.00,00:26:39.00,"he's either out, or it's going to be a tie, and he's going to"
408,00:26:42.83,00:26:42.83,get a shot at fate. >> Exactly.
409,00:26:44.67,00:26:44.67,"It really is a true toss-up, because I truly have a bond with"
410,00:26:48.71,00:26:48.71,Rupert. This is a game and I have to get
411,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,"myself as far as I can, but then do I put somebody else's game"
412,00:26:54.33,00:26:54.33,"at risk-- that I love-- out here, and that's been resting on"
413,00:26:58.00,00:26:58.00,"my shoulders today. >> PROBST: So, Rupert, what it"
414,00:27:00.88,00:27:00.88,"comes down to for you, tonight, and what I'm understanding, is"
415,00:27:04.17,00:27:04.17,whether or not Jenna is going to put your name down or Boston
416,00:27:07.71,00:27:07.71,"Rob's, her only other option. >> You know, everybody's"
417,00:27:10.67,00:27:10.67,got to play the game how they play.
418,00:27:12.50,00:27:12.50,And that's okay. But I hope that Jenna and I
419,00:27:17.79,00:27:17.79,"would stand strong, that we would force the rock issue."
420,00:27:23.08,00:27:23.08,>> PROBST: Amber. You have immunity.
421,00:27:25.42,00:27:25.42,Cannot vote for Amber. It is time to vote.
422,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,"Rupert, you're up. >> I don't know what"
423,00:27:41.25,00:27:41.25,else to say. I hope we both have two votes
424,00:27:42.71,00:27:42.71,"and I hope we go into a tie. >> You're a gentleman,"
425,00:27:54.25,00:27:54.25,buddy. It's been a pleasure playing the
426,00:27:56.71,00:27:56.71,game with you. I hope it's you tonight and not
427,00:27:59.42,00:27:59.42,me. Thanks. >> I still don't know.
428,00:28:40.58,00:28:40.58,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
429,00:28:52.62,00:28:52.62,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
430,00:28:54.21,00:28:54.21,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
431,00:28:55.88,00:28:55.88,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
432,00:29:00.67,00:29:00.67,First vote... Rob.
433,00:29:05.67,00:29:05.67,"Rupert. One vote Rob, one vote Rupert."
434,00:29:12.83,00:29:12.83,Rupert. Two votes for Rupert.
435,00:29:14.88,00:29:14.88,One vote Rob. The last vote...
436,00:29:23.29,00:29:23.29,The 15th person voted out of Survivor: All-Stars and the
437,00:29:26.38,00:29:26.38,"sixth member of our jury, Rupert."
438,00:29:28.67,00:29:28.67,Would you bring me your torch? >> It's part of the game.
439,00:29:48.17,00:29:48.17,">> PROBST: Rupert, the tribe has spoken."
440,00:29:53.67,00:29:53.67,"It's time for you to go. Well, you survived another vote,"
441,00:30:10.42,00:30:10.42,"made it through another day. We are now down to three people,"
442,00:30:15.33,00:30:15.33,"two Tribal Councils, one winner. Grab your torches."
443,00:30:19.50,00:30:19.50,Get back to camp. Good night.
444,00:30:27.46,00:30:27.46,>> I am a little angry at Jenna.
445,00:30:29.71,00:30:29.71,Greed won out over friendship. Almost disgusted me.
446,00:30:34.62,00:30:34.62,There is not one person in this game that can say I lied to
447,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,"them, that I played conniving. I did my best."
448,00:30:41.83,00:30:41.83,"I honestly had a very, very good experience with Survivor:"
449,00:30:45.83,00:30:45.83,All-Stars. (waves crashing)

451,00:31:03.67,00:31:03.67,game be put into a bag and roll the dice on whether I get a rock
452,00:31:08.42,00:31:08.42,that would send me home tonight. Not when I still had fate in my
453,00:31:12.67,00:31:12.67,hands that I could work. >> Regardless of your
454,00:31:15.83,00:31:15.83,"decision, whatever it was, I respect the fact that you made"
455,00:31:19.88,00:31:19.88,it on your own. >> Yeah.
456,00:31:22.00,00:31:22.00,>> And that's the most important thing.
457,00:31:25.00,00:31:25.00,"Ooh! >> Hey, Jeff."
458,00:31:37.08,00:31:37.08,>> Morning. >> PROBST: Good morning.
459,00:31:39.25,00:31:39.25,>> Morning. >> PROBST: What are you guys
460,00:31:41.50,00:31:41.50,doing up so early? >> We're the final three.
461,00:31:43.79,00:31:43.79,We couldn't really sleep too much.
462,00:31:45.21,00:31:45.21,>> PROBST: Beautiful moon. >> It is.
463,00:31:47.33,00:31:47.33,>> I got my girls. >> PROBST: Life is good.
464,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,">> Life is good. >> PROBST: Well, day 38 is here."
465,00:31:51.92,00:31:51.92,Today you'll take part in your final rite of passage.
466,00:31:55.50,00:31:55.50,We brought along a canoe. You'll take this map.
467,00:31:58.83,00:31:58.83,You'll follow it to an area where you will find an array of
468,00:32:02.12,00:32:02.12,body paints and jewelry used and worn by a local and fiercely
469,00:32:06.58,00:32:06.58,"independent tribe of Indians, the Cunas."
470,00:32:09.88,00:32:09.88,"You'll adorn your bodies as you see fit, then you'll set out on"
471,00:32:13.33,00:32:13.33,"foot. As you walk, you will come along"
472,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,the torches of your fellow tribe members who have been voted out.
473,00:32:21.33,00:32:21.33,Take a moment. Think about the impact they had
474,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,"on you and on the game. When you reach the last torch,"
475,00:32:27.50,00:32:27.50,I'll be waiting for you there to guide you through your final
476,00:32:31.54,00:32:31.54,immunity challenge. I encourage you to embrace this
477,00:32:35.00,00:32:35.00,day. You're never going to be back
478,00:32:37.17,00:32:37.17,"here again. >> Thanks, Jeff."
479,00:32:39.38,00:32:39.38,">> Thanks, Jeff. >> PROBST: I'll see you at the"
480,00:32:41.50,00:32:41.50,other side. >> You have to paddle.
481,00:32:46.46,00:32:46.46,( indistinct conversations ) >> Oh... there.
482,00:33:29.92,00:33:29.92,">> Oh, wow. >> Oh, my gosh."
483,00:33:37.21,00:33:37.21,>> This is so awesome. >> This is awesome.
484,00:33:40.75,00:33:40.75,>> Look at these. ( chanting )
485,00:34:06.79,00:34:06.79,>> ...that one looks like it goes...
486,00:34:13.00,00:34:13.00,>> You girls look pretty. ( giggling )
487,00:34:16.17,00:34:16.17,( chanting ) >> TINA: I'd do this again
488,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,because it's part of my being. This was such a life-expanding
489,00:34:57.42,00:34:57.42,adventure. I think I would have regretted
490,00:34:59.71,00:34:59.71,"if I didn't come, and I don't want any regrets in my life."
491,00:35:02.42,00:35:02.42,">> 75 years old. >> If I were military,"
492,00:35:05.67,00:35:05.67,"I'd salute you. >> The second time around,"
493,00:35:08.33,00:35:08.33,"I was three years slower, for one thing."
494,00:35:10.62,00:35:10.62,And there's a lot of cut-throating going on out 
495,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,there. And I should have known better.
496,00:35:21.21,00:35:21.21,">> I've already played this game, and I've already won."
497,00:35:24.38,00:35:24.38,"I'll look back on this just like I did the Amazon, and be glad"
498,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,that I fought through as much as I could.
499,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,"( chuckling ) >> He's not even here,"
500,00:35:33.29,00:35:33.29,"and he's making us laugh. >> I know, right?"
501,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,>> ROB C.: It's a little bit of a humbling experience.
502,00:35:37.83,00:35:37.83,"I thought that I might be, in fact, the greatest Survivor"
503,00:35:41.08,00:35:41.08,"player to ever play, but I was a victim of my own success, I"
504,00:35:44.50,00:35:44.50,think. >> One of the biggest
505,00:35:48.58,00:35:48.58,things that surprised me about the entire Survivor: All-Stars
506,00:35:51.29,00:35:51.29,was how tough it was. Certainly more tough than the
507,00:35:53.54,00:35:53.54,original game I played. Either I'm getting older or it's
508,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,"getting way, way too tough for me."
509,00:36:00.29,00:36:00.29,>> I was just totally exempt from any energy or
510,00:36:03.21,00:36:03.21,emotion. I decided that I had to leave.
511,00:36:06.00,00:36:06.00,It takes too much emotion to play this game.
512,00:36:10.42,00:36:10.42,>> COLBY: I found patience this time that I never knew I had.
513,00:36:13.67,00:36:13.67,"The game required it, my mental stability required it."
514,00:36:16.50,00:36:16.50,"And I was so proud to find it. >> ETHAN: In Africa, I didn't"
515,00:36:23.25,00:36:23.25,receive one vote against me the entire time I was out there.
516,00:36:25.88,00:36:25.88,"During All-Stars, you know, it hurts."
517,00:36:27.62,00:36:27.62,"And each time you see your name, you feel that little punch in"
518,00:36:30.38,00:36:30.38,your gut. I still want to be out there
519,00:36:32.67,00:36:32.67,playing the game. >> The reason why I'm
520,00:36:37.62,00:36:37.62,here is 'cause the reason why she's gone.
521,00:36:40.54,00:36:40.54,"Thanks, Jerri. >> I ask myself so many times"
522,00:36:43.04,00:36:43.04,"a day, ""Why would I want to put myself through this"
523,00:36:45.71,00:36:45.71,"again?"" I had no idea that it was going"
524,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,to nearly break my spirit. But it didn't.
525,00:36:54.46,00:36:54.46,>> I broke the biggest promise I made to myself coming into
526,00:36:56.88,00:36:56.88,this thing. I mixed friendship with the
527,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,game. The two cannot mix together.
528,00:37:01.33,00:37:01.33,And as soon as you allow a little too much compassion to
529,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,"show through, you're setting yourself up for disaster."
530,00:37:09.21,00:37:09.21,>> What I rely on is trust and loyalty and the better
531,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,qualities of life. Maybe I just don't have it in
532,00:37:15.38,00:37:15.38,myself to make it all the way to the million and lie.
533,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,">> This time around, I bit my tongue a lot more, I"
534,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,"walked away a lot more, kept my mouth quiet."
535,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,"I eased back on the challenges a lot, so that I didn't look like"
536,00:37:28.33,00:37:28.33,such a threat. And it got me six days further
537,00:37:31.75,00:37:31.75,into the game this time. >> I've played with the best.
538,00:37:38.04,00:37:38.04,"I beat my favorite players, I beat them all."
539,00:37:40.50,00:37:40.50,"And ultimately, it came down to bad luck with the numbers."
540,00:37:43.58,00:37:43.58,Sometimes that's the way the chips fall.
541,00:37:48.67,00:37:48.67,">> Truly, I didn't consider myself an All-Star."
542,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,"For me, just to say that I was in that group is a proud moment"
543,00:37:55.83,00:37:55.83,for an old country boy like me. >> I definitely consider
544,00:38:02.67,00:38:02.67,playing the game with him as a huge honor.
545,00:38:05.83,00:38:05.83,>> I came out here to take care of myself and everyone
546,00:38:09.17,00:38:09.17,"around me, and I did. I might not have won one damn"
547,00:38:11.92,00:38:11.92,"immunity challenge, but I won a few rewards."
548,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,"I enjoyed myself, I shared, I cared and I actually had fun."
549,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,>> Walking by all the torches made me feel proud to be
550,00:38:28.67,00:38:28.67,"standing where I was standing. But also a little guilty,"
551,00:38:31.67,00:38:31.67,knowing that I ended this game for a lot of those people.
552,00:38:34.83,00:38:34.83,"So, it was a little bit bittersweet."
553,00:38:37.67,00:38:37.67,I'm feeling a little scared and nervous... and not really
554,00:38:40.96,00:38:40.96,"knowing what's ahead. At the end of the day, one of us"
555,00:38:43.75,00:38:43.75,"is going to have immunity, and one of us will not be in the"
556,00:38:46.25,00:38:46.25,"final two. >> PROBST: Well, welcome to your"
557,00:39:14.21,00:39:14.21,"final immunity challenge. Amber, I'll take that back."
558,00:39:24.33,00:39:24.33,"For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
559,00:39:28.04,00:39:28.04,Today's immunity challenge is very simple.
560,00:39:30.50,00:39:30.50,It's all about endurance. How badly do you want it?
561,00:39:33.33,00:39:33.33,You will stand barefoot on posts.
562,00:39:35.83,00:39:35.83,"You'll have one hand on the Immunity Idol, and you'll stand"
563,00:39:39.46,00:39:39.46,there as long as you can. Here are the rules.
564,00:39:42.17,00:39:42.17,If either of your feet come off of that post at any time for any
565,00:39:46.17,00:39:46.17,reason; if your hand comes off of the Idol at any time for any
566,00:39:49.38,00:39:49.38,"reason; or if your second hand touches the idol, or the post"
567,00:39:52.50,00:39:52.50,"that it's sitting on, you're out of the game."
568,00:39:55.71,00:39:55.71,Last person left standing wins immunity.
569,00:39:59.50,00:39:59.50,Guaranteed a spot in the final two and a chance to face your
570,00:40:03.33,00:40:03.33,jury. And you decide who sits next to
571,00:40:06.38,00:40:06.38,you at that final Tribal Council.
572,00:40:09.58,00:40:09.58,All right. Take off your shoes and any
573,00:40:11.67,00:40:11.67,other clothing items or necklaces you don't want on
574,00:40:14.17,00:40:14.17,during this. Take your spot on the perch.
575,00:40:22.88,00:40:22.88,"All right, challenge has begun. Coming up on 30 minutes."
576,00:41:05.04,00:41:05.04,"Not much of a breeze, is there? >> Mm-mm."
577,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,>> Got a lively group here today.
578,00:41:15.12,00:41:15.12,The final immunity challenge. ( chanting )
579,00:41:38.71,00:41:38.71,>> PROBST: One hour in. Give me a status report.
580,00:41:41.33,00:41:41.33,"What's hurting the most, Jenna? >> The back foot."
581,00:41:44.17,00:41:44.17,It's just about trying to switch positions up without lifting
582,00:41:47.79,00:41:47.79,"your foot, without sending yourself off balance."
583,00:41:50.38,00:41:50.38,">> PROBST: How are you doing, Boston Rob?"
584,00:41:52.54,00:41:52.54,>> Good. >> PROBST: Amber?
585,00:41:54.17,00:41:54.17,">> Good. >> PROBST: Jenna, how long you"
586,00:41:56.00,00:41:56.00,think you can go? >> However long these two go.
587,00:41:59.00,00:41:59.00,>> PROBST: Really? >> One minute after that.
588,00:42:01.67,00:42:01.67,>> PROBST: Game is on. >> It's a million dollars.
589,00:42:05.79,00:42:05.79,So... game is on. I got a cramp.
590,00:42:14.67,00:42:14.67,>> Uh-oh. Jenna has a cramp.
591,00:42:30.96,00:42:30.96,">> PROBST: Two hours, guys. Two hours, 108 degrees."
592,00:42:51.17,00:42:51.17,Jenna... You lifted your foot.
593,00:42:54.04,00:42:54.04,>> I lifted my foot? >> PROBST: You lifted your back
594,00:42:56.50,00:42:56.50,foot. >> I thought I had the
595,00:42:58.67,00:42:58.67,"front of my foot on. >> PROBST: I'm sorry, Jenna."
596,00:43:02.83,00:43:02.83,"You're out. Just like that, we're down to"
597,00:43:09.17,00:43:09.17,Boston Rob and Amber. >> I want the Immunity.
598,00:43:12.67,00:43:12.67,You've had it a million times. A million times.
599,00:43:14.83,00:43:14.83,">> Okay. >> PROBST: Wait, wait, wait."
600,00:43:17.21,00:43:17.21,"Catch me up, what's going down? You're going to give her"
601,00:43:20.12,00:43:20.12,immunity and step off? >> I'm going to take
602,00:43:24.54,00:43:24.54,"you, no matter what. >> I'm going to take you,"
603,00:43:26.58,00:43:26.58,no matter what. >> Right.
604,00:43:29.62,00:43:29.62,"Let's fight it out, anyway. >> Okay."
605,00:43:32.58,00:43:32.58,Damn you. >> PROBST: Trust coming up.
606,00:43:34.67,00:43:34.67,">> No, it's not... >> PROBST: If it's not trust,"
607,00:43:36.67,00:43:36.67,one of you would step off. >> It's not trust.
608,00:43:38.67,00:43:38.67,It's just that... I hate giving up.
609,00:43:40.67,00:43:40.67,>> PROBST: Do you think this will play a factor in who wins?
610,00:43:44.75,00:43:44.75,"If somebody earned immunity, or if somebody gave it up?"
611,00:43:47.96,00:43:47.96,">> No, I just think like the whole... the whole game, we"
612,00:43:50.92,00:43:50.92,had an alliance since day one. And we stuck together the whole
613,00:43:53.42,00:43:53.42,time. And every single challenge we
614,00:43:56.29,00:43:56.29,"did, we always gave 100%, always."
615,00:43:58.83,00:43:58.83,We didn't even discuss if it came down to this.
616,00:44:01.00,00:44:01.00,">> We did talk about this. You're saying we didn't, but we"
617,00:44:04.04,00:44:04.04,did. >> That we'd would take
618,00:44:06.12,00:44:06.12,"each other, no matter what. >> No, we talked about if"
619,00:44:08.33,00:44:08.33,"we were the last two, would one of us step down?"
620,00:44:11.71,00:44:11.71,">> Hmm... >> Briefly, but we did."
621,00:44:14.00,00:44:14.00,>> You wouldn't want me to just let you win.
622,00:44:16.79,00:44:16.79,"You'd want to beat me, right? >> I just want to win."
623,00:44:20.29,00:44:20.29,"Honestly. >> Well, you're going to"
624,00:44:22.29,00:44:22.29,"have to beat me, then. >> Oh, that's nice."
625,00:45:08.00,00:45:08.00,">> AMBER I thought about doing that a couple times, but I"
626,00:45:10.17,00:45:10.17,didn't know if I could reach. >> You can reach.
627,00:45:13.04,00:45:13.04,">> I can only... >> PROBST: Amber, you're out."
628,00:45:18.17,00:45:18.17,>> AMBER I touched it. >> PROBST: You know what you
629,00:45:21.62,00:45:21.62,"did? >> Yeah, I touched it."
630,00:45:23.17,00:45:23.17,>> PROBST: Stopped thinking for two seconds.
631,00:45:26.17,00:45:26.17,>> I did. >> PROBST: You're out.
632,00:45:28.17,00:45:28.17,"Just like that. Boston Rob, you have final"
633,00:45:29.96,00:45:29.96,immunity. Get over here.
634,00:45:36.50,00:45:36.50,"Nicely done. You wanted to earn it, you"
635,00:45:39.29,00:45:39.29,earned it. The last time-- immunity.
636,00:45:44.42,00:45:44.42,You're going to the final two. And tonight at Tribal you will
637,00:45:48.17,00:45:48.17,"decide if indeed it's going to be Amber, maybe there's a change"
638,00:45:50.75,00:45:50.75,of heart. Jenna ends up there.
639,00:45:56.83,00:45:56.83,"All right, guys, grab your stuff, head back to camp."
640,00:45:59.29,00:45:59.29,I'll see you at Tribal in a little bit.
641,00:46:22.54,00:46:22.54,>> You know I wanted to win today.
642,00:46:24.54,00:46:24.54,"I gave up everything with Rupert, and I could have picked"
643,00:46:26.54,00:46:26.54,rocks yesterday maybe Rob would have gone.
644,00:46:29.33,00:46:29.33,But I lifted my damn foot so I blew it.
645,00:46:33.67,00:46:33.67,I had a million dollar check written in my hand because I
646,00:46:35.92,00:46:35.92,would have brought Boston Rob-- I would have won.
647,00:46:39.17,00:46:39.17,And it all comes down to me lifting my foot up.
648,00:46:43.17,00:46:43.17,My daughter's going to be very proud.
649,00:46:46.67,00:46:46.67,"My game's over. Boston Rob won immunity, he's"
650,00:46:49.00,00:46:49.00,"going to bring Amber, which strategically might not be the"
651,00:46:52.25,00:46:52.25,"best bet because, you know, I think she's going to annihilate"
652,00:46:55.25,00:46:55.25,him in the vote. He'd have better chance against
653,00:46:57.21,00:46:57.21,me but he won't see that. He's giving his girlfriend
654,00:47:00.54,00:47:00.54,a million dollars. That's a pretty good boyfriend.
655,00:47:04.67,00:47:04.67,>> Are you serious? >> It's not that I don't
656,00:47:06.50,00:47:06.50,"believe you... >> Oh, my God."
657,00:47:07.92,00:47:07.92,">> Do you know for sure? If you were in my position,"
658,00:47:10.62,00:47:10.62,"you'd have like a scared feeling, too."
659,00:47:12.79,00:47:12.79,">> Let me tell you something for sure, 100% I'm"
660,00:47:18.12,00:47:18.12,taking you. Okay? >> I feel 99% sure that
661,00:47:20.88,00:47:20.88,"I'm going to the final two with Rob, but I have seen him turn on"
662,00:47:24.21,00:47:24.21,people out here. I have seen him break his word
663,00:47:26.04,00:47:26.04,"to people out here. >> Clean up the attitude, will"
664,00:47:29.08,00:47:29.08,ya? >> I just can't help but
665,00:47:31.75,00:47:31.75,feel nervous. >> All of a sudden I guess I
666,00:47:46.00,00:47:46.00,"I can't think too clearly, trying to realize if what I've"
667,00:47:50.71,00:47:50.71,"been doing this whole time has been the right thing, is my head"
668,00:47:53.92,00:47:53.92,"clouded, is my judgment bad? I'm not sure where my odds are"
669,00:48:00.29,00:48:00.29,"better. Amber played a solid game, but"
670,00:48:04.83,00:48:04.83,Amber did ride my coattails the entire way.
671,00:48:08.62,00:48:08.62,"I don't know, maybe she conned me the whole way."
672,00:48:11.17,00:48:11.17,Maybe it's the biggest scam in the history of Survivor.
673,00:48:14.83,00:48:14.83,"If I go with Jenna, maybe more people are annoyed at Jenna."
674,00:48:18.25,00:48:18.25,But then I look like a complete ass because I'll sell out
675,00:48:22.00,00:48:22.00,absolutely anybody to win this game.
676,00:48:24.88,00:48:24.88,I don't know if I can or cannot win against either one of them.
677,00:48:30.17,00:48:30.17,I keep changing my own mind 50 times a day.
678,00:48:34.21,00:48:34.21,"I'm going to think about it, you know."
679,00:48:37.50,00:48:37.50,And I'm going to make the decision that I feel most
680,00:48:40.54,00:48:40.54,comfortable with. Based on me... not based on
681,00:48:46.08,00:48:46.08,"morals, not based on an alliance that I should or shouldn't"
682,00:48:50.25,00:48:50.25,honor. A million dollars... what would
683,00:48:58.46,00:48:58.46,you do for a million dollars? >> PROBST: Now bring in our
684,00:49:23.54,00:49:23.54,"jury, Lex, Kathy, Alicia, Shii Ann,"
685,00:49:29.58,00:49:29.58,Big Tom and Rupert-- voted out at the last Tribal Council.
686,00:49:37.83,00:49:37.83,"Long day. Started early, had an emotional"
687,00:49:41.75,00:49:41.75,"morning then you had your last immunity challenge, where it was"
688,00:49:44.17,00:49:44.17,hot. And it was purely endurance.
689,00:49:48.92,00:49:48.92,"Jenna, you were first off. What happened?"
690,00:49:52.04,00:49:52.04,>> I don't know. You said my foot moved off the
691,00:49:53.79,00:49:53.79,"peg. >> PROBST: Yeah, it was very"
692,00:49:55.71,00:49:55.71,"subtle, definitely. >> I'm sure."
693,00:49:59.67,00:49:59.67,>> PROBST: Frustrating? >> More frustrating that
694,00:50:01.46,00:50:01.46,it didn't even come down to me like falling off or getting too
695,00:50:04.42,00:50:04.42,tired or anything like that. So that's frustrating.
696,00:50:07.67,00:50:07.67,">> PROBST: So, Jenna's first off."
697,00:50:09.88,00:50:09.88,"It comes down to Amber and Boston Rob, and immediately both"
698,00:50:12.79,00:50:12.79,"of you guys look at each other and say, let's make a deal."
699,00:50:16.33,00:50:16.33,But a deal never ended up happening.
700,00:50:18.29,00:50:18.29,"Amber, was that because this is a game that has a trust issue?"
701,00:50:23.62,00:50:23.62,>> I will not deny that nerves were definitely taking
702,00:50:27.08,00:50:27.08,"play and definitely thinking, I would feel much better walking"
703,00:50:30.79,00:50:30.79,in tonight with the necklace on and being in control instead of
704,00:50:33.17,00:50:33.17,"letting him be in control. >> PROBST: Rob, was that any"
705,00:50:35.17,00:50:35.17,part of your decision not to step off
706,00:50:37.42,00:50:37.42,"that, what if I do and she turns on me and takes Jenna instead?"
707,00:50:43.17,00:50:43.17,It had to go through your head a little bit.
708,00:50:44.67,00:50:44.67,">> Yeah, of course it went through my mind."
709,00:50:47.29,00:50:47.29,"I mean, how can it not. You can tell, even at this stage"
710,00:50:52.29,00:50:52.29,"still there's paranoia.  >> PROBST: So, Rob, you have"
711,00:50:57.50,00:50:57.50,immunity. Huge decision.
712,00:51:00.04,00:51:00.04,You can talk about your relationship with Amber all you
713,00:51:01.75,00:51:01.75,"want, this is still a game. This is still a strategic"
714,00:51:05.00,00:51:05.00,"decision, one way or another. >> Strategically I mean I"
715,00:51:09.46,00:51:09.46,don't know necessarily that I even have a shot of winning
716,00:51:12.83,00:51:12.83,"against either of them. >> PROBST: Jenna, how shocked"
717,00:51:16.33,00:51:16.33,would you be if I came back and the vote said Amber?
718,00:51:18.83,00:51:18.83,>> I'd probably die of shock. That would be the biggest shock
719,00:51:21.33,00:51:21.33,of my life. But these two are airtight.
720,00:51:23.88,00:51:23.88,And I think it's a lot romantic as it is strategic.
721,00:51:27.42,00:51:27.42,But I think Boston Rob is actually wary of going up
722,00:51:29.58,00:51:29.58,"against Amber in the final two, and his chances with me would be"
723,00:51:33.33,00:51:33.33,better. >> PROBST: How does that make
724,00:51:36.00,00:51:36.00,"you feel, Amber, to hear that? >> I think he's thought"
725,00:51:38.50,00:51:38.50,through every decision 100% the entire time he's been out here.
726,00:51:41.83,00:51:41.83,And whether or not his feelings for me help make the decision of
727,00:51:46.92,00:51:46.92,"keeping our alliance together in this final two, I mean if it was"
728,00:51:52.00,00:51:52.00,"me, there is no decision to be made."
729,00:51:55.17,00:51:55.17,>> PROBST: So you're able to separate any romantic feelings
730,00:51:57.50,00:51:57.50,you might have for Rob from honoring an alliance that is
731,00:52:01.42,00:52:01.42,about the game? >> Yeah.
732,00:52:03.08,00:52:03.08,I think I've been in control of my emotions for Rob and in
733,00:52:08.75,00:52:08.75,control of my strategic decisions in this game for sure.
734,00:52:13.54,00:52:13.54,">> PROBST: Rob, are you able to do the same thing?"
735,00:52:15.54,00:52:15.54,>> Absolutely. 100%.
736,00:52:18.17,00:52:18.17,No doubt about it. >> PROBST: Okay.
737,00:52:20.92,00:52:20.92,Let's get to the vote. Here is how it's going to work.
738,00:52:23.25,00:52:23.25,Boston Rob has immunity. You can't vote for him.
739,00:52:26.00,00:52:26.00,"Jenna, you can only vote for Amber; Amber you can only vote"
740,00:52:29.29,00:52:29.29,"for Jenna; Your votes cancel each other out, so the only"
741,00:52:31.29,00:52:31.29,person who will vote is Rob. With one vote you're going to
742,00:52:35.00,00:52:35.00,vote out the 16th person from this game.
743,00:52:37.83,00:52:37.83,But what you are really doing with that vote is deciding who
744,00:52:40.50,00:52:40.50,you are going to sit next to as part of the final two.
745,00:52:43.79,00:52:43.79,It's time to make that vote. You're up.
746,00:53:20.50,00:53:20.50,">> PROBST: I'll go get the vote. Once the vote is read, the"
747,00:53:41.67,00:53:41.67,decision is final. The person voted out will be
748,00:53:43.96,00:53:43.96,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
749,00:53:46.33,00:53:46.33,"I'll read the vote. The 16th person voted out, and"
750,00:53:53.33,00:53:53.33,the final member of our jury-- Jenna.
751,00:53:57.21,00:53:57.21,"Need to bring your torch. Jenna, the tribe has spoken."
752,00:54:28.25,00:54:28.25,"Well, congratulations. You have gone as far as you can"
753,00:54:31.92,00:54:31.92,go in this game. The power now shifts to the
754,00:54:34.29,00:54:34.29,jury. Seven people you had a hand in
755,00:54:37.00,00:54:37.00,voting out now hold your fate in their hands.
756,00:54:41.29,00:54:41.29,You have one final night in Panama.
757,00:54:44.42,00:54:44.42,"Enjoy it, and I will see you tomorrow for final Tribal"
758,00:54:46.92,00:54:46.92,"Council. Grab your torches, head to camp."
759,00:54:52.25,00:54:52.25,>> This time I'm very proud of the way I played the
760,00:54:55.25,00:54:55.25,game. I didn't get blind-sided.
761,00:54:57.17,00:54:57.17,"I think I was more observant, more strategic and I had a lot"
762,00:55:00.54,00:55:00.54,"more fun, that's for sure. 38 days out of 39, feels pretty"
763,00:55:03.67,00:55:03.67,good. But I'm going to relive that
764,00:55:07.17,00:55:07.17,"stupid foot move for the rest of my life, because it's the"
765,00:55:10.29,00:55:10.29,difference of a million dollars. >> To be able to spend 39
766,00:55:35.71,00:55:35.71,"days now with a person who always makes you happy, always"
767,00:55:41.75,00:55:41.75,makes you feel completely safe in any situation...
768,00:55:49.58,00:55:49.58,always makes you feel important and proud of yourself is just
769,00:55:53.12,00:55:53.12,amazing. Hey.
770,00:55:56.17,00:55:56.17,>> What? >> We're the final two.
771,00:55:57.50,00:55:57.50,">> I know, I told you that this afternoon after Jenna"
772,00:56:00.17,00:56:00.17,"stepped off. >> Yeah, but now it's"
773,00:56:05.08,00:56:05.08,like there's nobody else here. It's just you and me.
774,00:56:09.04,00:56:09.04,">> They're gone. >> I came into this game,"
775,00:56:12.25,00:56:12.25,"and within the first couple of minutes, Rob and I had formed an"
776,00:56:14.38,00:56:14.38,alliance. And over the first couple of
777,00:56:17.54,00:56:17.54,"days there was a lot of flirting going on, and it turned into"
778,00:56:21.04,00:56:21.04,something real. And now we have an amazing bond.
779,00:56:24.67,00:56:24.67,And I'm so glad that that was my strategy in the beginning
780,00:56:28.04,00:56:28.04,because look what I ended up with.
781,00:56:30.17,00:56:30.17,>> We came as far as we can. It's not up to us anymore.
782,00:56:34.00,00:56:34.00,"Everything we did, we did it by the book."
783,00:56:36.50,00:56:36.50,">> It's over, it's over and done with."
784,00:56:44.17,00:56:44.17,">> 15 minutes after the game started, we were able to"
785,00:56:46.50,00:56:46.50,work as a team. Even when we got separated and
786,00:56:50.71,00:56:50.71,"weren't together, we were still able to work through it as a"
787,00:56:52.88,00:56:52.88,team. I mean in a game where trust is
788,00:56:56.50,00:56:56.50,"fleeting to have a partnership with someone, an alliance with"
789,00:57:00.67,00:57:00.67,"someone that you can trust, that's huge."
790,00:57:04.21,00:57:04.21,"They thought we were, you know, screwing around, flirting,"
791,00:57:09.33,00:57:09.33,da-da-da... >> Little did they know.
792,00:57:11.33,00:57:11.33,>> They never had a clue. They never seen it coming.
793,00:57:13.50,00:57:13.50,">> We were playing the game, too."
794,00:57:21.54,00:57:21.54,>> They're going to hate us when this is over.
795,00:57:24.79,00:57:24.79,"They're all going to hate us. Well, cheers."
796,00:57:29.96,00:57:29.96,>> Cheers. >> Cheers on our victory.
797,00:57:33.08,00:57:33.08,>> Cheers to us. >> It captured the moment.
798,00:57:48.08,00:57:48.08,>> That's a good one. That's my favorite one.
799,00:57:51.17,00:57:51.17,You look dirty. The game was over.
800,00:58:00.17,00:58:00.17,I mean what a huge relief. What a huge weight off your
801,00:58:03.21,00:58:03.21,shoulders to know that now it's in the jury's hands.
802,00:58:06.08,00:58:06.08,We're done voting people off. We're done strategizing.
803,00:58:10.50,00:58:10.50,"Now we can just sit back, relax and enjoy that last day."
804,00:58:15.38,00:58:15.38,And I love that. >> I'm completely at
805,00:58:26.04,00:58:26.04,"peace right now, you know that? >> Mm-hmm, me, too."
806,00:58:28.25,00:58:28.25,I feel... 100% relaxed. I'm not worrying about anything
807,00:58:33.04,00:58:33.04,that's going on tonight. Nothing.
808,00:58:34.88,00:58:34.88,I'm not even thinking about it. I'm sure I will when it gets
809,00:58:37.42,00:58:37.42,"down to it, but right now I'm just kind of like..."
810,00:58:42.25,00:58:42.25,>> Good picture. >> We're taking in every
811,00:58:45.08,00:58:45.08,last moment. We're not really taking anything
812,00:58:47.42,00:58:47.42,for granted. So going to one of our little
813,00:58:51.42,00:58:51.42,"favorite spots and just enjoying it one last time, and knowing"
814,00:58:55.33,00:58:55.33,"that nobody else is around, it was just our island."
815,00:58:59.67,00:58:59.67,"Just a great, great feeling. >> The black one or the"
816,00:59:02.83,00:59:02.83,blue one? >> I don't like the black ones.
817,00:59:06.00,00:59:06.00,>> You don't like the black ones?
818,00:59:07.71,00:59:07.71,">> Well, I mean, not as much. >> Our last fish."
819,00:59:24.67,00:59:24.67,This guy's going to be the last fish I eat.
820,00:59:27.58,00:59:27.58,Last supper over here today. Last lunch.
821,00:59:33.50,00:59:33.50,I don't know how I ever made it without Rupert out here.
822,00:59:36.96,00:59:36.96,Who would have known I could actually fish and clean them and
823,00:59:40.17,00:59:40.17,cook them and fend for myself. Still alive.
824,00:59:45.79,00:59:45.79,"You know I said in the beginning also that this game Survivor,"
825,00:59:49.33,00:59:49.33,"was basically like Charles Darwin's premise, survival of"
826,00:59:51.62,00:59:51.62,the fittest. The species that's best able to
827,00:59:54.96,00:59:54.96,adapt to certain situations will outlive the others.
828,00:59:58.83,00:59:58.83,"And I think as a team, Amber and I were most able to adapt to"
829,01:00:02.92,01:00:02.92,certain situations. Maybe they'll give us both a
830,01:00:05.79,01:00:05.79,million. >> You never know.
831,01:00:10.50,01:00:10.50,There is a very important night coming up.
832,01:00:13.54,01:00:13.54,And there are a lot of anxious people who are really looking
833,01:00:17.25,01:00:17.25,forward to grilling us. I hope I'm not forced into
834,01:00:20.67,01:00:20.67,saying why they should pick me over Rob.
835,01:00:25.29,01:00:25.29,">> See, this time a jury is made up of people who know"
836,01:00:28.83,01:00:28.83,"me, and they know how I am. I'm sure people took this game"
837,01:00:32.17,01:00:32.17,"very, very personal, and that's their own frickin' problem."
838,01:00:46.88,01:00:46.88,"I outwitted, I outlasted, and I feel I outplayed them all."
839,01:00:52.58,01:00:52.58,The feeling that I have inside me right now is where the
840,01:00:57.67,01:00:57.67,"sleep deprivation, the lack of food, the suffering, the highs,"
841,01:01:03.25,01:01:03.25,"the lows of the game, it's worth everything."
842,01:01:07.17,01:01:07.17,"Look at these socks. They've been good to us, huh?"
843,01:01:13.38,01:01:13.38,>> The way the day is ending with this rain and
844,01:01:16.21,01:01:16.21,"being miserable is, of course, bringing on the miserable"
845,01:01:19.17,01:01:19.17,feelings of going to Tribal Council.
846,01:01:21.46,01:01:21.46,I think the vibe of the jury tonight is going to be pretty
847,01:01:24.50,01:01:24.50,"cold, you know. They came out here with their"
848,01:01:26.67,01:01:26.67,"second chance, and the fact that they didn't get to finish"
849,01:01:29.29,01:01:29.29,it and we did... I don't think they're going to make this easy
850,01:01:31.96,01:01:31.96,for us at all. I think the jury would love to
851,01:01:34.38,01:01:34.38,see Rob and I squirm. >> It's been quite an
852,01:01:44.46,01:01:44.46,adventure. And now that we're leaving...
853,01:01:48.79,01:01:48.79,"I feel both a little bit of sadness, but definitely joy."
854,01:01:54.50,01:01:54.50,I did everything I wanted to do out here.
855,01:01:57.29,01:01:57.29,I did it to the best of my ability.
856,01:01:59.75,01:01:59.75,I gave 110% every single day. And I'm sitting in the final two
857,01:02:04.08,01:02:04.08,with Amber. I'm proud of the way I played.
858,01:02:07.58,01:02:07.58,And I have no regrets. Bugs are still killing me.
859,01:02:30.88,01:02:30.88,">> PROBST: Amber, Rob. >> Hi, Jeff."
860,01:02:33.75,01:02:33.75,>> Jeff. >> PROBST: Have a seat.
861,01:02:41.58,01:02:41.58,"We'll now bring in your jury-- Lex, Kathy, Alicia, Shii Ann,"
862,01:02:49.58,01:02:49.58,"Big Tom, Rupert and Jenna-- voted out at the last Tribal"
863,01:02:53.96,01:02:53.96,"Council. Well, congratulations."
864,01:03:05.42,01:03:05.42,"You outwitted, outplayed and outlasted your 16 other tribe"
865,01:03:09.83,01:03:09.83,"mates. And after 39 long, tough,"
866,01:03:13.62,01:03:13.62,"emotional days, it comes down to this."
867,01:03:17.92,01:03:17.92,"Tonight, your jury-- seven people that you had a hand in"
868,01:03:21.75,01:03:21.75,voting out-- now hold your fate in their hands.
869,01:03:25.17,01:03:25.17,They will decide which one of the two of you walks out of here
870,01:03:28.33,01:03:28.33,with bragging rights as winner of Survivor: All-Stars and the
871,01:03:31.38,01:03:31.38,million dollar check that goes with it.
872,01:03:35.67,01:03:35.67,Here's how it's going to work. You'll both get a chance to make
873,01:03:38.79,01:03:38.79,an opening statement. Convince these guys why it
874,01:03:41.17,01:03:41.17,should be you that gets the million dollars.
875,01:03:43.83,01:03:43.83,The jury will then get their first opportunity to address you
876,01:03:47.38,01:03:47.38,since being voted out. After listening to everything
877,01:03:51.00,01:03:51.00,"that's been said, you'll get a final comment-- one last chance"
878,01:03:54.38,01:03:54.38,to win them over. Then we'll vote.
879,01:03:57.46,01:03:57.46,Clear? Let's get started.
880,01:04:00.67,01:04:00.67,"Opening comments, Rob. >> All right."
881,01:04:06.71,01:04:06.71,"Obviously, uh, the last 39 days have been long, emotional."
882,01:04:12.50,01:04:12.50,"And you're sitting over there, and I guarantee you guys are all"
883,01:04:16.71,01:04:16.71,pissed off to be over there. I didn't want to let personal
884,01:04:20.54,01:04:20.54,relationships interfere in this game.
885,01:04:23.79,01:04:23.79,"When the merge happened, I had a situation where I made a promise"
886,01:04:27.04,01:04:27.04,"to someone that I wasn't able to keep, because of promises I made"
887,01:04:30.33,01:04:30.33,"to some other people. In the end, that's where"
888,01:04:33.46,01:04:33.46,everything started to go south for me.
889,01:04:36.12,01:04:36.12,"Obviously, when you have a jury that you have to vote out, it's"
890,01:04:40.38,01:04:40.38,going to come back to haunt you in one way or the other.
891,01:04:43.83,01:04:43.83,But I would like you guys to consider how I played the game
892,01:04:48.04,01:04:48.04,as a player-- always trying to do well for my team; at the same
893,01:04:52.25,01:04:52.25,"time, trying to look out for myself."
894,01:04:56.79,01:04:56.79,"Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks, Rob."
895,01:04:59.25,01:04:59.25,"Amber. >> Hi, guys."
896,01:05:01.67,01:05:01.67,"Um, I came into the game saying that I knew it was going to be"
897,01:05:05.17,01:05:05.17,"harder, because this time around, I was going to be"
898,01:05:07.54,01:05:07.54,"playing with people that I knew, instead"
899,01:05:10.21,01:05:10.21,"of just strangers. And, you know, I said I didn't"
900,01:05:13.46,01:05:13.46,come out here to make friends. I didn't come out here to--
901,01:05:16.62,01:05:16.62,"gosh, you know-- have a relationship with a guy."
902,01:05:19.04,01:05:19.04,"You know, I came out here to win a million dollars."
903,01:05:21.58,01:05:21.58,And little did I know all these little bonuses came along with
904,01:05:24.38,01:05:24.38,"it. So, I think the reason why I'm"
905,01:05:27.17,01:05:27.17,"sitting here right now is luck, all of you guys for not voting"
906,01:05:31.17,01:05:31.17,me off and because of my alliance with Rob.
907,01:05:33.92,01:05:33.92,Those are the three things that got me here.
908,01:05:36.17,01:05:36.17,And I know that you guys probably all have sore feelings.
909,01:05:39.92,01:05:39.92,I know I had sore feelings when I sat in the jury.
910,01:05:44.00,01:05:44.00,I just wanted to let you know that I got out of this game what
911,01:05:47.00,01:05:47.00,"I really wanted to do, and I'm satisfied."
912,01:05:51.33,01:05:51.33,">> PROBST: All right. Jury, it's now in your court."
913,01:05:54.25,01:05:54.25,"In a moment, you will get a chance to address Rob and Amber"
914,01:05:57.17,01:05:57.17,for the first time since being voted out.
915,01:05:59.71,01:05:59.71,I'm going to give you a moment to think about what you want to
916,01:06:02.00,01:06:02.00,say. >> PROBST: Okay.
917,01:06:20.54,01:06:20.54,It is time now for you to face your jury.
918,01:06:23.33,01:06:23.33,It's the first time they've had a chance to say anything to
919,01:06:26.17,01:06:26.17,"you since being voted out. Lex, you're up first."
920,01:06:36.08,01:06:36.08,">> ""It's just a game."" That's something we probably all"
921,01:06:40.33,01:06:40.33,said a thousand times while we were out here.
922,01:06:42.92,01:06:42.92,"And I'm sure that for both of you, it was an excuse that"
923,01:06:45.96,01:06:45.96,helped wash away the guilt as you played the game the way that
924,01:06:49.38,01:06:49.38,you played it. You know what?
925,01:06:51.79,01:06:51.79,"That phrase, ""It's just a game"" is a big lie."
926,01:06:54.50,01:06:54.50,"It's not just a game. For all of us out here, for all"
927,01:06:58.67,01:06:58.67,"of you, it's life. And the line between game and"
928,01:07:02.88,01:07:02.88,life is not cut and dried. Life blurs into the game
929,01:07:07.29,01:07:07.29,constantly. This game exposes who we are as
930,01:07:12.67,01:07:12.67,people to the core. It's like truth serum.
931,01:07:16.33,01:07:16.33,And I think the way you play this game is representative of
932,01:07:19.50,01:07:19.50,the kind of person you are. The hardest lesson I learned out
933,01:07:23.17,01:07:23.17,here was about friendship and betrayal.
934,01:07:25.88,01:07:25.88,And I think the true measure of a man is what kind of friend he
935,01:07:29.54,01:07:29.54,"is. What kind of a friend are you,"
936,01:07:31.88,01:07:31.88,Rob? What kind of a friend were you
937,01:07:34.54,01:07:34.54,to me? You asked me to do you a favor--
938,01:07:37.00,01:07:37.00,"bro to bro, friend to friend-- and I did the only thing I could"
939,01:07:39.88,01:07:39.88,do. And that was to answer the call
940,01:07:42.62,01:07:42.62,of a friend in need. You repaid that by putting a
941,01:07:45.21,01:07:45.21,knife in my back. As far as this game is
942,01:07:47.83,01:07:47.83,"concerned, I lost, and you both beat me."
943,01:07:50.67,01:07:50.67,"No sour grapes, no bitterness. With all sincerity, I will"
944,01:07:53.50,01:07:53.50,congratulate both of you for being in the final two.
945,01:07:56.62,01:07:56.62,"But as I see it, as good as your game was, you sold out your"
946,01:08:00.71,01:08:00.71,"values, you sold out your character and you sold out your"
947,01:08:04.50,01:08:04.50,friends for a stack of greenbacks.
948,01:08:08.00,01:08:08.00,"I hope it was worth it, 'cause that money will never be"
949,01:08:11.92,01:08:11.92,enough to buy it all back. >> PROBST: Kathy.
950,01:08:28.21,01:08:28.21,">> Um, when you got off Survivor: Marquesas, I"
951,01:08:32.25,01:08:32.25,distinctly remember that you were so concerned about how
952,01:08:36.46,01:08:36.46,"people perceived you. What I ask of you today is,"
953,01:08:40.67,01:08:40.67,"after this game-- where you took friends to advance to a place,"
954,01:08:45.67,01:08:45.67,and you killed friendships to get there-- what will people
955,01:08:50.29,01:08:50.29,"think of you now? Are you concerned about it, and"
956,01:08:53.29,01:08:53.29,where is it? >> Yeah.
957,01:08:55.83,01:08:55.83,I'm concerned about it. Uh...
958,01:09:00.62,01:09:00.62,"To be completely honest with you, I don't know where it is."
959,01:09:04.50,01:09:04.50,I'm still floored by Lex's thing right now.
960,01:09:08.50,01:09:08.50,"Uh... Here's the thing, Kat."
961,01:09:12.46,01:09:12.46,"Looking back, I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the game"
962,01:09:18.50,01:09:18.50,"anymore. I mean, somewhere along the way,"
963,01:09:22.29,01:09:22.29,"I got caught up with, you know, playing people against each"
964,01:09:26.38,01:09:26.38,other and just doing whatever I had to do to get to the end.
965,01:09:30.71,01:09:30.71,"And now, looking back on it, I definitely, definitely see it a"
966,01:09:35.62,01:09:35.62,"different way, after Lex's speech."
967,01:09:39.29,01:09:39.29,But I wouldn't want people to think that I intentionally came
968,01:09:44.00,01:09:44.00,out here in this game to ruin friendships.
969,01:09:47.38,01:09:47.38,I'm not a malicious person. I would not intentionally do
970,01:09:51.33,01:09:51.33,"that to try to hurt anybody. >> Amber, um..."
971,01:10:00.50,01:10:00.50,did you play Rob as a patsy to get to the million?
972,01:10:03.92,01:10:03.92,"And if you get to the million and after it's all over, are you"
973,01:10:08.17,01:10:08.17,going to have a relationship with him?
974,01:10:11.33,01:10:11.33,And it can't be a gray area. It's got to be yes or no.
975,01:10:16.29,01:10:16.29,Or is there going to be a phone call from Pittsburgh to Boston
976,01:10:18.83,01:10:18.83,"if you have the million? I mean, are you playing him?"
977,01:10:22.33,01:10:22.33,">> I started this game out, um... flirting with Rob as"
978,01:10:26.67,01:10:26.67,"strategy, for sure. But early on in the game--"
979,01:10:30.50,01:10:30.50,within the first ten days-- I started developing feelings.
980,01:10:33.92,01:10:33.92,And I started getting caught up in the security in him and the
981,01:10:38.00,01:10:38.00,emotional support and just the way he made me feel.
982,01:10:42.50,01:10:42.50,"And I will tell you that yes, I have a genuine relationship with"
983,01:10:46.67,01:10:46.67,"Rob, and I definitely hope to continue our relationship"
984,01:10:50.33,01:10:50.33,afterwards. >> Thank you.
985,01:10:52.33,01:10:52.33,"I mean, thank you for a yes-or-no answer."
986,01:10:54.50,01:10:54.50,"Thank you. Um, Rob, you just need to know"
987,01:10:57.17,01:10:57.17,"that I was crushed, obviously. Look at me."
988,01:11:00.75,01:11:00.75,I've been off this thing for 12 days.
989,01:11:03.50,01:11:03.50,You were like a kid to... a son. And I was crushed that you
990,01:11:07.58,01:11:07.58,"didn't address what we had. If you didn't want me around,"
991,01:11:11.50,01:11:11.50,"that's fine. We came, we merged, and we were"
992,01:11:14.29,01:11:14.29,outnumbered. I got it.
993,01:11:16.38,01:11:16.38,I got it. I got that we were outplayed.
994,01:11:18.42,01:11:18.42,I got it. But I just can't imagine any
995,01:11:20.83,01:11:20.83,game in the world where you can check your friendships at the
996,01:11:23.96,01:11:23.96,door. It's just not in my chemistry
997,01:11:26.54,01:11:26.54,"and my makeup, and I thought it wasn't in yours."
998,01:11:29.50,01:11:29.50,">> I know. >> So, in 15 minutes, you"
999,01:11:32.17,01:11:32.17,"made an alliance, and you-you ruined friendships that took two"
1000,01:11:35.38,01:11:35.38,years to build. And it-it-it just... it just
1001,01:11:39.12,01:11:39.12,"crushed me. So, I do congratulate you guys"
1002,01:11:41.67,01:11:41.67,"sincerely for being here, however you got here."
1003,01:11:44.08,01:11:44.08,But I just want you to know that you used some friendships as
1004,01:11:47.33,01:11:47.33,stepping stones to get there. And it's been a devilish game.
1005,01:11:50.62,01:11:50.62,"But I think you could have taken a parallel course, where these"
1006,01:11:54.12,01:11:54.12,"people wouldn't have been left in carnage, and they would have"
1007,01:11:57.54,01:11:57.54,been feeling a little bit better about their decisions tonight.
1008,01:12:01.67,01:12:01.67,And maybe that's immaturity-- I don't know--
1009,01:12:03.75,01:12:03.75,but there was another path right next to you-- you didn't see
1010,01:12:06.67,01:12:06.67,it-- that you could have thrown us just an ounce of respect.
1011,01:12:10.50,01:12:10.50,"And this wouldn't be here. So, good luck with it."
1012,01:12:13.79,01:12:13.79,Thanks. >> PROBST: Rupert.
1013,01:12:27.12,01:12:27.12,>> That's an emotional one to follow.
1014,01:12:29.50,01:12:29.50,"First I want to say hey to you guys and congratulations, and"
1015,01:12:33.62,01:12:33.62,thank you to you both for helping me get as far as I did.
1016,01:12:38.17,01:12:38.17,"You know, I appreciate it. When we made a pact on day 12,"
1017,01:12:41.88,01:12:41.88,you guys stuck with me. You didn't know me.
1018,01:12:44.83,01:12:44.83,"So what I'd really like to ask you, Amber, what did you really"
1019,01:12:48.00,01:12:48.00,"do to get to the final two, and why should I give you my vote?"
1020,01:12:52.92,01:12:52.92,>> To get to the final two I played this game the best
1021,01:12:55.50,01:12:55.50,way I know how. And honestly that was taking it
1022,01:12:59.12,01:12:59.12,"day by day. Um, I faced a lot of obstacles"
1023,01:13:02.42,01:13:02.42,in this game. Obviously there was a time when
1024,01:13:04.96,01:13:04.96,my entire tribe was switched and I was the only one left from the
1025,01:13:09.04,01:13:09.04,"original tribe, and I fought like hell to stay in the game,"
1026,01:13:14.04,01:13:14.04,but I kept saying in my head that this is my second chance at
1027,01:13:17.12,01:13:17.12,a million dollars. And so I guess the main reason
1028,01:13:20.04,01:13:20.04,why I think I played the game well is I never lost my focus.
1029,01:13:23.38,01:13:23.38,">> True. So, Rob, why should I give you"
1030,01:13:27.46,01:13:27.46,my vote? >> Because you're a man
1031,01:13:31.00,01:13:31.00,of your word. That's why you should give me
1032,01:13:33.17,01:13:33.17,your vote. ( Rupert laughing )
1033,01:13:37.50,01:13:37.50,">> Again, you know, congratulations to both of you."
1034,01:13:41.46,01:13:41.46,">> PROBST: Thanks, Rupert. >> Thanks, Rupe."
1035,01:13:44.33,01:13:44.33,">> PROBST: Alicia. >> There is one factor,"
1036,01:13:52.00,01:13:52.00,"in my opinion, that is the lowest form of standard of play"
1037,01:13:56.67,01:13:56.67,"that you can reach, and you two not only mastered it, but relied"
1038,01:14:02.33,01:14:02.33,"on it, to get to the final two, and that is the fine art of"
1039,01:14:06.67,01:14:06.67,butt-kissing and ego-stroking. You both did so much of it that
1040,01:14:12.04,01:14:12.04,I couldn't possibly decide which one of you has got less crap on
1041,01:14:15.33,01:14:15.33,"your lips. Now, you may have outwitted us,"
1042,01:14:19.67,01:14:19.67,outplayed us and outlasted us but you have not outclassed us.
1043,01:14:25.21,01:14:25.21,Let me ask you both one question.
1044,01:14:27.17,01:14:27.17,"And, for this question, I need one answer, and one word and one"
1045,01:14:31.04,01:14:31.04,word only. How would you say you played
1046,01:14:34.17,01:14:34.17,"this game, Rob? >> Competitively."
1047,01:14:39.33,01:14:39.33,>> Excuse me? >> Competitively.
1048,01:14:42.00,01:14:42.00,>> Amber? >> With luck.
1049,01:14:45.67,01:14:45.67,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Shii Ann.
1050,01:15:00.17,01:15:00.17,">> First of all, congratulations to the both of you."
1051,01:15:02.79,01:15:02.79,You have earned it. There have been a lot of words
1052,01:15:05.33,01:15:05.33,"exchanged tonight, you know, a lot of people's feelings are"
1053,01:15:08.17,01:15:08.17,"hurt, but as someone who's competed with every single"
1054,01:15:11.67,01:15:11.67,"person here, I would like to throw out there that people in"
1055,01:15:14.88,01:15:14.88,glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
1056,01:15:18.38,01:15:18.38,"I feel like all is fair in love and war and in Survivor, so"
1057,01:15:23.17,01:15:23.17,"tonight you two are on an even, level, playing ground."
1058,01:15:27.00,01:15:27.00,"I haven't decide who I'm going to vote for, so I'd like you to"
1059,01:15:30.38,01:15:30.38,"tell me, in all honesty, three reasons why the person sitting"
1060,01:15:34.46,01:15:34.46,next to you deserves to win that million dollars more than you.
1061,01:15:37.50,01:15:37.50,Rob? >> Amber has been the
1062,01:15:42.96,01:15:42.96,truest partner in this game to me that I've ever had.
1063,01:15:47.04,01:15:47.04,I asked her once for her friendship and she's never
1064,01:15:50.17,01:15:50.17,wavered the entire time we've been out here.
1065,01:15:53.83,01:15:53.83,"Secondly, she never quit on anything she said she was going"
1066,01:15:58.50,01:15:58.50,"to do, whatsoever. And third, her support towards"
1067,01:16:03.17,01:16:03.17,our alliance has been unprecedented.
1068,01:16:07.00,01:16:07.00,"I mean, I would not be here right now if it were not for"
1069,01:16:10.83,01:16:10.83,her. I think she played a straight-up
1070,01:16:14.00,01:16:14.00,game and I think she deserves it.
1071,01:16:18.00,01:16:18.00,>> Amber? >> Um...I think-- number
1072,01:16:20.96,01:16:20.96,"one, I thought he ruled in all the challenges."
1073,01:16:25.42,01:16:25.42,And I thought he was probably the most-- I think he was the
1074,01:16:28.00,01:16:28.00,most competitive person out here in all the challenges.
1075,01:16:30.04,01:16:30.04,"Um... two, I think in this game um, in order to get this far,"
1076,01:16:36.12,01:16:36.12,you need to find one person that you can truly depend on and
1077,01:16:42.21,01:16:42.21,I found that in Rob. I found that I could tell him
1078,01:16:44.92,01:16:44.92,anything and he would never think of it as something he
1079,01:16:49.12,01:16:49.12,could use against me in the game.
1080,01:16:51.29,01:16:51.29,"And then, third, ten or 15 minutes into the game, he made"
1081,01:16:55.17,01:16:55.17,"an alliance with me, and he stuck to it, even if he might"
1082,01:16:59.75,01:16:59.75,"have doubted in his head, he never let me know about it."
1083,01:17:03.08,01:17:03.08,">> Okay. Thank you, guys."
1084,01:17:06.12,01:17:06.12,">> PROBST: Jenna. >> Well, I do congratulate"
1085,01:17:13.54,01:17:13.54,you two. I think you played a great game.
1086,01:17:15.88,01:17:15.88,Uh... I don't feel negative feelings like some of these
1087,01:17:19.25,01:17:19.25,people do because we had an alliance that you didn't break
1088,01:17:22.25,01:17:22.25,"with us, with Rupert and I, so I have no hard feelings that way."
1089,01:17:25.21,01:17:25.21,"You played a very similar game, but since you're so"
1090,01:17:28.17,01:17:28.17,"interchangeable, I'm going to go with... what are you going to do"
1091,01:17:31.96,01:17:31.96,with the million dollars? Rob first.
1092,01:17:35.33,01:17:35.33,">> You know that, uh, I coach, volunteer coach, inline"
1093,01:17:39.33,01:17:39.33,hockey at Boston University. I got a couple of kids on the
1094,01:17:41.96,01:17:41.96,"team that they can't afford to pay the tuition, so somehow I'll"
1095,01:17:46.00,01:17:46.00,try to use it to start some sort of a scholarship fund for my
1096,01:17:50.67,01:17:50.67,players on my team. If I could somehow set that up
1097,01:17:53.88,01:17:53.88,"to help some of them out, I think it would be good."
1098,01:17:56.83,01:17:56.83,>> College scholarship fund. Okay.
1099,01:17:59.00,01:17:59.00,"Amber? >> Um, for me, I have a"
1100,01:18:02.29,01:18:02.29,"lot of good friends, older and younger, who have been diagnosed"
1101,01:18:06.25,01:18:06.25,"with the disease of muscular dystrophy, and usually you don't"
1102,01:18:09.79,01:18:09.79,get diagnosed with that until much later on in life when
1103,01:18:12.46,01:18:12.46,"you're like 50s, but I have a friend who is in her 20s and she"
1104,01:18:15.50,01:18:15.50,"was diagnosed with it. So, um, the one charity that I"
1105,01:18:19.83,01:18:19.83,wanted to help out if I could was a charity involving muscular
1106,01:18:22.42,01:18:22.42,dystrophy. >> Thank you.

1117,01:19:02.58,01:19:02.58,goats on the farm. When they get to running the
1118,01:19:04.83,01:19:04.83,"nanny, I castrate them, and I never seen a boy run a woman"
1119,01:19:07.58,01:19:07.58,"like you did. If that was part of strategy,"
1120,01:19:10.08,01:19:10.08,"that was... you did, you did a good job."
1121,01:19:12.21,01:19:12.21,"So I guess I'm going to say to you, Amber, uh... I don't know"
1122,01:19:15.58,01:19:15.58,"how I'll vote. So you tell me, why I should"
1123,01:19:18.38,01:19:18.38,give you a million dollars and not Rob.
1124,01:19:20.50,01:19:20.50,"Just... right straight up. Why should, why should I?"
1125,01:19:23.04,01:19:23.04,>> I knew this question was going to be somebody's
1126,01:19:25.83,01:19:25.83,"question, and I think it's the hardest answer to, to... to"
1127,01:19:29.17,01:19:29.17,answer. >> It shouldn't be.
1128,01:19:31.25,01:19:31.25,">> I think it's the hardest question to answer, but"
1129,01:19:33.29,01:19:33.29,"uh, if I'm forced into answering it, I'm going to be honest,"
1130,01:19:36.50,01:19:36.50,and... >> I'd appreciate that.
1131,01:19:38.08,01:19:38.08,">> Well, I'm just saying with Rob sitting next to me, you"
1132,01:19:40.88,01:19:40.88,"know, it's hard to do, but I think you guys all deserve it."
1133,01:19:42.83,01:19:42.83,">> Sometimes it's hard to be honest, Amber."
1134,01:19:44.50,01:19:44.50,I can tell you about that-- sometimes it is. I'd just like
1135,01:19:47.42,01:19:47.42,"for tonight, let's be honest. >> So, I think that the"
1136,01:19:50.62,01:19:50.62,reason why I should win this game over Rob is because we
1137,01:19:53.00,01:19:53.00,"really didn't break our word to each other, whereas you and Rob"
1138,01:19:55.33,01:19:55.33,did. Do you understand what I'm
1139,01:19:57.17,01:19:57.17,"trying to say? >> In other words, we just"
1140,01:19:59.04,01:19:59.04,"lied a little bit and me and Rob lied a whole lot, or... I mean,"
1141,01:20:02.25,01:20:02.25,I don't understand it. Wha... what... Clarify that last
1142,01:20:04.62,01:20:04.62,"statement. I, um... >> I think that you knew"
1143,01:20:06.46,01:20:06.46,this entire game that your alliance with Rob was much
1144,01:20:09.67,01:20:09.67,stronger than your alliance with me.
1145,01:20:11.46,01:20:11.46,So if you're basing your votes on who had a stronger word and
1146,01:20:14.96,01:20:14.96,"who broke their word, I think I didn't really break my word as"
1147,01:20:18.33,01:20:18.33,much to you as Rob did. >> Thank you.
1148,01:20:22.17,01:20:22.17,"Hey, brother Rob, I know that I'm stupid for waiting this long"
1149,01:20:26.46,01:20:26.46,"to make up my mind but, like I said, I've been with you from"
1150,01:20:29.79,01:20:29.79,"day one and I mean with you. Rob, uh, why should I vote for"
1151,01:20:33.83,01:20:33.83,"you and not Amber? >> In all fairness, Tom..."
1152,01:20:38.08,01:20:38.08,"the conversation we had before you got kicked off, you and I"
1153,01:20:44.33,01:20:44.33,know inside what really happened in terms of who said what and
1154,01:20:51.04,01:20:51.04,"who lied about what. And, yeah, I broke the alliance,"
1155,01:20:56.17,01:20:56.17,but you plotted to get me kicked off beforehand and I found out
1156,01:21:00.88,01:21:00.88,first. So I got rid of you before you
1157,01:21:04.38,01:21:04.38,"had the chance to get rid of me. >> In other words, you"
1158,01:21:07.17,01:21:07.17,voted me off 'cause I was going to try to kick you off?
1159,01:21:09.96,01:21:09.96,>> You did try to get me kicked off.
1160,01:21:13.12,01:21:13.12,">> All right. Well, I guess that's all, so"
1161,01:21:15.46,01:21:15.46,"with saying that, I just want to say, no hard feelings."
1162,01:21:18.50,01:21:18.50,">> No hard feelings, Tom. >> Don't be stupid, stupid."
1163,01:21:22.67,01:21:22.67,I may have fell for that once. I fell for it twice.
1164,01:21:26.08,01:21:26.08,Not this time. >> PROBST: Okay.
1165,01:21:53.50,01:21:53.50,A lot was said tonight about how you two played this game.
1166,01:21:58.00,01:21:58.00,"Some people respected it, others didn't at all."
1167,01:22:00.88,01:22:00.88,This is your last chance to convince them it should be you
1168,01:22:04.00,01:22:04.00,"and not the other person. Amber, we'll start with you."
1169,01:22:08.29,01:22:08.29,">> Well, I came here tonight, expecting this to be"
1170,01:22:13.67,01:22:13.67,"very difficult, 'cause I know every single one of you would"
1171,01:22:16.00,01:22:16.00,love to be sitting where I'm sitting.
1172,01:22:17.50,01:22:17.50,"I really thought, coming in here tonight, that I learned so much"
1173,01:22:22.75,01:22:22.75,about myself throughout the past 39 days.
1174,01:22:26.42,01:22:26.42,"But instead, after tonight I learned the most about myself"
1175,01:22:31.04,01:22:31.04,just after these past couple of minutes.
1176,01:22:35.25,01:22:35.25,I'm not happy what I learned about myself and I want you to
1177,01:22:42.83,01:22:42.83,know that I'm going to take away what I learned tonight and apply
1178,01:22:49.50,01:22:49.50,it to my life. I know it's very hard for you
1179,01:22:52.75,01:22:52.75,guys all to express your feelings and be completely
1180,01:22:55.50,01:22:55.50,"honest with us, and so I just wanted you to know that in every"
1181,01:22:59.62,01:22:59.62,"answer that I gave tonight, I was completely honest with you,"
1182,01:23:03.71,01:23:03.71,"and if that's the most I can give to you tonight, you have"
1183,01:23:06.54,01:23:06.54,it. That's it.
1184,01:23:11.33,01:23:11.33,>> PROBST: Rob. >> Uh... I guess the
1185,01:23:14.83,01:23:14.83,first thing I want to say is that I'm sorry to each and every
1186,01:23:20.00,01:23:20.00,one of youse for breaking alliances and friendships and
1187,01:23:26.88,01:23:26.88,"all the pain that you guys must feel over there, and to tell you"
1188,01:23:31.33,01:23:31.33,"the truth, I'm not really feeling much better sitting over"
1189,01:23:35.42,01:23:35.42,here right now. Uh...I played the game as hard
1190,01:23:39.62,01:23:39.62,"as I could, but I'd be naive to be able to sit in one of the"
1191,01:23:43.67,01:23:43.67,last two seats and think that people on that side were gonna
1192,01:23:48.29,01:23:48.29,feel all right about the way I played the game.
1193,01:23:53.88,01:23:53.88,"It got a lot more personal than I thought it ever would, and"
1194,01:24:02.00,01:24:02.00,"from tonight, I was expecting it to be hard."
1195,01:24:05.83,01:24:05.83,"I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as hard as it was, I"
1196,01:24:11.38,01:24:11.38,really wasn't... but... I'm really having a tough
1197,01:24:20.67,01:24:20.67,"time even finding the words to tell you the truth,"
1198,01:24:24.00,01:24:24.00,and fumbling over all my answers. Excuse me.
1199,01:24:29.71,01:24:29.71,Uh... This is not really the time to
1200,01:24:33.88,01:24:33.88,"be screwing it up either, but, I mean I guess I've been screwing"
1201,01:24:37.58,01:24:37.58,"it up for a long time, haven't I?"
1202,01:24:39.92,01:24:39.92,Maybe we could laugh a little bit.
1203,01:24:42.12,01:24:42.12,Uh... I had fun... And... I'm sorry.
1204,01:24:48.33,01:24:48.33,"That's all I have to say, really."
1205,01:24:51.33,01:24:51.33,">> PROBST: Only one thing left  to do, and that is vote."
1206,01:24:55.25,01:24:55.25,Tonight the voting is very different.
1207,01:24:57.04,01:24:57.04,"Tonight the jury is voting for somebody, based on everything"
1208,01:25:01.17,01:25:01.17,"that's happened over the last 39 days, and tonight they're gonna"
1209,01:25:04.25,01:25:04.25,cast a vote for the person they think most deserving of winning
1210,01:25:08.00,01:25:08.00,"this game. It's really that simple, and it"
1211,01:25:11.17,01:25:11.17,"really is time to vote. Lex, you're up."
1212,01:25:25.00,01:25:25.00,">> Before I show who I'm voting for, I'd like to say"
1213,01:25:28.00,01:25:28.00,"that both of you should just step up, be proud of the way you"
1214,01:25:30.50,01:25:30.50,played. You made it to the final two.
1215,01:25:34.08,01:25:34.08,You beat us all. That's my vote-- Boston Rob.
1216,01:25:37.83,01:25:37.83,You do deserve it. You ruled this game physically.
1217,01:25:40.54,01:25:40.54,This is a large sum of money. I hope you win it.
1218,01:25:53.79,01:25:53.79,>> Rob... do you remember back in the middle of
1219,01:25:57.67,01:25:57.67,"the game when you and I shook hands, looked each other in the"
1220,01:26:03.33,01:26:03.33,"eye, and I promised you that I would never write your name"
1221,01:26:07.25,01:26:07.25,down? I'm a woman of my word.
1222,01:26:28.17,01:26:28.17,>> Rob... I thought of you as a brother.
1223,01:26:32.17,01:26:32.17,I stayed and defended you for 36 days.
1224,01:26:36.79,01:26:36.79,All over saying something about I was gonna vote you off?
1225,01:26:40.12,01:26:40.12,"Hey, never once crossed my mind. And when you find out the true"
1226,01:26:45.50,01:26:45.50,"story, maybe you can call and apologize."
1227,01:26:59.71,01:26:59.71,>> ( sighs ) I am such a sucker.
1228,01:27:02.25,01:27:02.25,I am such a sucker. But you know what?
1229,01:27:04.83,01:27:04.83,"In the end, friendship rules, and I know that we have a really"
1230,01:27:08.29,01:27:08.29,"good, tight friendship, so I'm giving you the million bucks"
1231,01:27:11.67,01:27:11.67,"because I love what we have and I think it's still there, it's"
1232,01:27:15.25,01:27:15.25,"just damaged. So take it, man."
1233,01:27:18.92,01:27:18.92,"Take it and run with it, all right? I love you."
1234,01:27:29.38,01:27:29.38,">> PROBST: For the last time, I'll go get the votes."
1235,01:27:54.75,01:27:54.75,">> PROBST: Rob, Amber, jury, I know it's been a long 39 days."
1236,01:27:58.46,01:27:58.46,It's about to get a little bit longer.
1237,01:28:00.21,01:28:00.21,The votes will be read live when we get back to the United.
1238,01:28:02.71,01:28:02.71,"States, See you there. ( helicopter rotors whirring )"
1239,01:30:34.33,01:30:34.33,"( cheering and applause ) >> PROBST: What's going on, New"
1240,01:31:20.54,01:31:20.54,York? Thanks for stopping by.
1241,01:31:27.00,01:31:27.00,Let's get to this. Let's do it!
1242,01:31:47.67,01:31:47.67,"All right. Well, first thing I see, Amber,"
1243,01:31:51.75,01:31:51.75,"is your shirt, which, uh... ( audience yelling )"
1244,01:32:05.67,01:32:05.67,"Well, I guess that answers the question Kathy posed,"
1245,01:32:08.21,01:32:08.21,about whether this is authentic or not.
1246,01:32:11.38,01:32:11.38,Clearly a very personal season. One of the most powerful and
1247,01:32:17.50,01:32:17.50,"honest Tribal Councils we've had in a while, final Tribal."
1248,01:32:20.42,01:32:20.42,"So as you two sit there tonight, Amber, I'll start with you,"
1249,01:32:23.50,01:32:23.50,"after this whole season, you look at this jury, everything"
1250,01:32:28.04,01:32:28.04,"you went through, how are you feeling about your chances to"
1251,01:32:30.79,01:32:30.79,win this game? >> Good Lord. Um...
1252,01:32:36.92,01:32:36.92,>> PROBST: How are you feeling? You've been thinking about this
1253,01:32:38.83,01:32:38.83,for a long time. Do you think you've got a shot
1254,01:32:40.67,01:32:40.67,or not? >> I think I definitely
1255,01:32:42.46,01:32:42.46,have a shot. I think it's going to be a close
1256,01:32:44.50,01:32:44.50,vote. I think it's going to come down
1257,01:32:46.79,01:32:46.79,to one vote. I think it's going to be
1258,01:32:48.58,01:32:48.58,be one deciding vote. So I think I definitely have a
1259,01:32:50.67,01:32:50.67,"shot. >> PROBST: Boston Rob, in many"
1260,01:32:54.04,01:32:54.04,"ways, with all due respect to the other 17, this was your"
1261,01:32:57.54,01:32:57.54,season. You dominated physically...
1262,01:33:00.96,01:33:00.96,( cheering and applause ) ...and subject to a lot of
1263,01:33:08.88,01:33:08.88,"controversy, you dominated strategically."
1264,01:33:11.71,01:33:11.71,"No matter how you look at it, we'll talk about the"
1265,01:33:14.96,01:33:14.96,"consequences of that, but as you sit here tonight, listening to"
1266,01:33:18.62,01:33:18.62,"what these guys had to say to you, some very personal"
1267,01:33:21.33,01:33:21.33,"feelings, how do you feel about this whole season for yourself?"
1268,01:33:25.58,01:33:25.58,">> Well, you know what, Jeff, regardless of what happens"
1269,01:33:29.83,01:33:29.83,"here tonight with the vote, I feel like I already won."
1270,01:33:33.79,01:33:33.79,I have the most special girl in the entire world sitting here
1271,01:33:37.88,01:33:37.88,"right next to me. If you don't mind, I'd like to"
1272,01:33:42.50,01:33:42.50,say something to her. ( audience clamoring )
1273,01:33:50.71,01:33:50.71,"Amber, we came a long way in this crazy game."
1274,01:33:54.71,01:33:54.71,"I've seen you at your highest high and your lowest low, and"
1275,01:33:59.33,01:33:59.33,"between it all, we've worked together as a team to accomplish"
1276,01:34:03.21,01:34:03.21,"so much. It was really crazy, and in the"
1277,01:34:08.62,01:34:08.62,"end, I ended up falling in love with you."
1278,01:34:12.67,01:34:12.67,"You're the most amazing person I've ever met in my entire life,"
1279,01:34:16.67,01:34:16.67,and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
1280,01:34:19.00,01:34:19.00,"( audience cheering ) Amber, I love you with all my"
1281,01:34:31.33,01:34:31.33,heart. Will you marry me?
1282,01:34:36.00,01:34:36.00,>> Yes. ( audience cheering )
1283,01:35:02.92,01:35:02.92,">> You okay? >> PROBST: Rob, guys..."
1284,01:35:08.83,01:35:08.83,">> We're going to sit down. >> PROBST: First, let me answer"
1285,01:35:16.25,01:35:16.25,one question that is on everybody's mind.
1286,01:35:18.67,01:35:18.67,The big twist that we've been promoting that's going to be
1287,01:35:22.29,01:35:22.29,"revealed tonight, that is not it."
1288,01:35:25.21,01:35:25.21,( laughter ) That was Rob's twist.
1289,01:35:30.79,01:35:30.79,So catch us up. Do your parents-- both sets of
1290,01:35:33.92,01:35:33.92,parents-- I don't know if we saw it-- just got up and hugged.
1291,01:35:36.33,01:35:36.33,Did you tell anybody? >> My parents and Amber's
1292,01:35:40.62,01:35:40.62,parents both know. I spoke with Mr. and Mrs.
1293,01:35:43.17,01:35:43.17,"Brkich and asked their permission, and I spoke with my"
