209,00:13:18.83,00:13:21.79,>> Cheers.The four people that are
210,00:13:21.79,00:13:26.38,in the final four are twodistinct groups of two.
211,00:13:26.38,00:13:28.50,There's no chance myself andAmber are going to break.
212,00:13:28.50,00:13:32.29,I think it's a toss-up: Jennamay turn on Rupert.
213,00:13:32.29,00:13:35.46,It may come down to a purplerock.
214,00:13:35.46,00:13:38.62,>> I've been thinkingabout this whole purple rock
215,00:13:38.62,00:13:41.83,"thing.>> So far, like, the game"
216,00:13:41.83,00:13:44.38,has gone so well for all of us.>> Yeah.
217,00:13:44.38,00:13:47.50,I'm very concerned with the tie-breaker situation.
218,00:13:47.50,00:13:50.21,What would happen is whoever hasimmunity has immunity.
219,00:13:50.21,00:13:53.67,And then the other three have toreach into a bag-- there's two
220,00:13:53.67,00:13:56.71,white rocks and one purple one.The person who gets the purple
221,00:13:56.71,00:13:59.25,rock is out of the game.I don't want it to come to a
222,00:13:59.25,00:14:01.00,frickin' rock.>> I know.
223,00:14:01.00,00:14:02.67,>> That's not what weplayed for.
224,00:14:02.67,00:14:04.96,>> We knew it was goingto come down to a purple rock.
225,00:14:04.96,00:14:08.29,So we gave her the option ofvoting out Rupert tonight.
226,00:14:08.29,00:14:10.67,">> Well, you guys just keep upyour end and vote Rupert."
227,00:14:10.67,00:14:12.58,">> We will.>> Strategically, I"
228,00:14:12.58,00:14:14.83,came out here to win.And this is the way to do it for
229,00:14:14.83,00:14:18.92,me; it gets me one step closer.I didn't come 37 days to reach
230,00:14:18.92,00:14:22.79,into a bag and let a colordecide my fate.
231,00:14:22.79,00:14:26.04,So I'm taking fate in my ownhands.
232,00:14:26.04,00:14:29.83,">> Is that breakfast I smell?>> Yes, ma'am!"
233,00:14:29.83,00:14:33.17,>> All I've beencraving is a pancake.
234,00:14:33.17,00:14:36.50,"It was the... I, like, ate tinylittle bites."
235,00:14:36.50,00:14:40.58,"It's better than I have at home.Oh, my God!"
236,00:14:40.58,00:14:43.00,>> Mm.>> This morning's breakfast is
237,00:14:43.00,00:14:49.12,good-bye to one of us.Somebody is leaving tonight.
238,00:14:49.12,00:15:06.54,"Boy, I hope it's not me.>> PROBST: All right, let's get"
239,00:15:06.54,00:15:10.00,"to today's immunity challenge.Boston Rob, give it up."
240,00:15:14.42,00:15:18.38,"Immunity, back up for grabs.For today's immunity challenge,"
241,00:15:18.38,00:15:21.21,we have constructed a giantmaze.
242,00:15:21.21,00:15:24.12,"On my go, you will race from thecenter of the maze to eight"
243,00:15:24.12,00:15:26.17,different points within themaze.
244,00:15:26.17,00:15:28.33,"At each point, you'll find aladder rung."
245,00:15:28.33,00:15:30.67,"Untie it, bring it back to thecenter."
246,00:15:30.67,00:15:33.33,"Along the way, you're going toencounter various obstacles"
247,00:15:33.33,00:15:35.50,blocking your path.And you're going see the same
248,00:15:35.50,00:15:39.29,obstacle more than once.The trick is don't get confused.
249,00:15:39.29,00:15:41.92,"Once you've gathered all eight,you'll assemble your ladder,"
250,00:15:41.92,00:15:44.54,climb to the top of the tower.First person to the top of the
251,00:15:44.54,00:15:46.83,tower wins.Make sense?
252,00:15:46.83,00:15:50.04,We'll draw colors.Wait for my go.
253,00:15:52.46,00:15:55.75,"Here we go, guys.For immunity and a guaranteed"
254,00:15:55.75,00:15:58.00,spot in the Final Three.Survivors ready...

316,00:21:12.33,00:21:17.88,"I debated it, kept throwing theidea around, and I'm not."
317,00:21:19.38,00:21:23.17,I can't do it.I'd rather sit there and pick a
318,00:21:23.17,00:21:26.92,rock than give than give themthe smug satisfaction of knowing
319,00:21:26.92,00:21:33.17,that they're guaranteed a spot.>> My fate rests on the

327,00:21:56.75,00:21:58.12,">> Maybe you, too.>> Exactly."

329,00:22:01.04,00:22:02.50,>> Because you won'tdo it against her.
330,00:22:02.50,00:22:05.17,That's my point.>> There's a possibility
331,00:22:05.17,00:22:06.83,I could beat her.There's no possibility I can
332,00:22:06.83,00:22:08.50,beat Rupert.There's no possibility you can
333,00:22:08.50,00:22:09.83,beat Rupert.>> I disagree.
334,00:22:09.83,00:22:11.33,I disagree.>> It's the difference
335,00:22:11.33,00:22:14.33,between maybe winning themillion or a 30% shot at maybe
336,00:22:14.33,00:22:18.00,going home.>> Now I don't know.
337,00:22:18.00,00:22:20.17,I'm not letting Rob push me intoanything.
338,00:22:20.17,00:22:23.33,"But there is truth.I mean, I would be in the final"
339,00:22:23.33,00:22:25.67,three.I might even be able to
340,00:22:25.67,00:22:27.75,"beat them, and then I've gota million dollars."
341,00:22:27.75,00:22:30.08,>> Let's go spend sometime together.
342,00:22:30.08,00:22:34.54,This might be my last day here.>> Don't be sad.

346,00:22:40.92,00:22:42.83,"There's nothing I can do aboutit, so I'm not going to worry"
347,00:22:42.83,00:22:45.96,"about it, you know?>> Yeah."
348,00:22:45.96,00:22:48.67,">> If I do go tonight,you'd better win."
349,00:22:48.67,00:22:52.83,You'd better. You'd better.>> I want you to come
350,00:22:52.83,00:23:01.83,with me.>> This is so good.
351,00:23:05.58,00:23:10.54,The decision is still a littleup in the air... to be honest.
352,00:23:10.54,00:23:12.79,">> I can't see Jennagoing against me, and I don't"
353,00:23:12.79,00:23:15.58,want to go against Jenna.She's just a little paranoid.
354,00:23:15.58,00:23:17.50,You got to let her alone.She's just a young girl.
355,00:23:17.50,00:23:20.67,"She's fine.Either way, I appreciate it."
356,00:23:20.67,00:23:23.67,>> I know.>> I believe that she
357,00:23:23.67,00:23:26.33,will write Rob's name down.>> At the beginning of
358,00:23:26.33,00:23:30.88,"this game, Jenna would say...""Don't let emotional attachment"
359,00:23:30.88,00:23:33.33,"get in the way of your strategicsurvival game."""

363,00:23:42.83,00:23:46.42,>> Rupert's a very smart player.I give him a lot of credit.
364,00:23:46.42,00:23:50.17,He's probably conned Jenna intofeeling bad about doing anything
365,00:23:50.17,00:23:57.00,but pulling a rock.>> I've never been in
366,00:23:57.00,00:24:00.08,so much turmoil in my life.I have the power tonight.
367,00:24:00.08,00:24:02.67,I really don't know what I'mgoing to do... until I get to
368,00:24:02.67,00:24:05.17,"tribal council.It's really, really a tough"

373,00:24:49.96,00:24:53.83,Tom clearly blindsided.Jury reaction was pretty strong.
374,00:24:53.83,00:24:56.12,"Did you see it, Jenna?>> Of course I did."
375,00:24:56.12,00:24:57.75,">> PROBST: Did it put anythingthrough your head, because the"

634,00:45:39.29,00:45:44.42,earned it.The last time-- immunity.
635,00:45:44.42,00:45:48.17,You're going to the final two.And tonight at Tribal you will
636,00:45:48.17,00:45:50.75,"decide if indeed it's going tobe Amber, maybe there's a change"
637,00:45:50.75,00:45:55.08,of heart.Jenna ends up there.
638,00:45:56.83,00:45:59.29,"All right, guys, grab yourstuff, head back to camp."
639,00:45:59.29,00:46:02.42,I'll see you at Tribal in alittle bit.

643,00:46:29.33,00:46:33.67,But I lifted my damn foot so Iblew it.
644,00:46:33.67,00:46:35.92,I had a million dollar checkwritten in my hand because I
645,00:46:35.92,00:46:39.17,would have brought Boston Rob--I would have won.
646,00:46:39.17,00:46:43.17,And it all comes down to melifting my foot up.
647,00:46:43.17,00:46:46.67,My daughter's going to bevery proud.
648,00:46:46.67,00:46:49.00,"My game's over.Boston Rob won immunity, he's"
649,00:46:49.00,00:46:52.25,"going to bring Amber, whichstrategically might not be the"
650,00:46:52.25,00:46:55.25,"best bet because, you know, Ithink she's going to annihilate"
651,00:46:55.25,00:46:57.21,him in the vote.He'd have better chance against
652,00:46:57.21,00:47:00.54,me but he won't see that.He's giving his girlfriend
653,00:47:00.54,00:47:04.67,a million dollars.That's a pretty good boyfriend.
654,00:47:04.67,00:47:06.50,>> Are you serious?>> It's not that I don't
655,00:47:06.50,00:47:07.92,"believe you...>> Oh, my God."
656,00:47:07.92,00:47:10.62,">> Do you know for sure?If you were in my position,"
657,00:47:10.62,00:47:12.79,"you'd have like a scaredfeeling, too."

659,00:47:18.12,00:47:20.88,taking you. Okay?>> I feel 99% sure that
660,00:47:20.88,00:47:24.21,"I'm going to the final two withRob, but I have seen him turn on"
661,00:47:24.21,00:47:26.04,people out here.I have seen him break his word
662,00:47:26.04,00:47:29.08,"to people out here.>> Clean up the attitude, will"

664,00:47:31.75,00:47:46.00,feel nervous.>> All of a sudden I guess I
665,00:47:46.00,00:47:50.71,"I can't think too clearly,trying to realize if what I've"
666,00:47:50.71,00:47:53.92,"been doing this whole time hasbeen the right thing, is my head"
667,00:47:53.92,00:48:00.29,"clouded, is my judgment bad?I'm not sure where my odds are"
668,00:48:00.29,00:48:04.83,"better.Amber played a solid game, but"
669,00:48:04.83,00:48:08.62,Amber did ride my coattails theentire way.
670,00:48:08.62,00:48:11.17,"I don't know, maybe she connedme the whole way."
671,00:48:11.17,00:48:14.83,Maybe it's the biggest scam inthe history of Survivor.
672,00:48:14.83,00:48:18.25,"If I go with Jenna, maybe morepeople are annoyed at Jenna."
673,00:48:18.25,00:48:22.00,But then I look like a completeass because I'll sell out
674,00:48:22.00,00:48:24.88,absolutely anybody to win thisgame.
675,00:48:24.88,00:48:30.17,I don't know if I can or cannotwin against either one of them.
676,00:48:30.17,00:48:34.21,I keep changing my own mind50 times a day.
677,00:48:34.21,00:48:37.50,"I'm going to think about it, youknow."
678,00:48:37.50,00:48:40.54,And I'm going to make thedecision that I feel most
679,00:48:40.54,00:48:46.08,comfortable with.Based on me... not based on
680,00:48:46.08,00:48:50.25,"morals, not based on an alliancethat I should or shouldn't"
681,00:48:50.25,00:48:58.46,honor.A million dollars... what would

685,00:49:37.83,00:49:41.75,"Long day.Started early, had an emotional"
686,00:49:41.75,00:49:44.17,"morning then you had your lastimmunity challenge, where it was"
687,00:49:44.17,00:49:48.92,hot.And it was purely endurance.
688,00:49:48.92,00:49:52.04,"Jenna, you were first off.What happened?"
689,00:49:52.04,00:49:53.79,>> I don't know.You said my foot moved off the

692,00:49:59.67,00:50:01.46,>> PROBST: Frustrating?>> More frustrating that
693,00:50:01.46,00:50:04.42,it didn't even come down to melike falling off or getting too
694,00:50:04.42,00:50:07.67,tired or anything like that.So that's frustrating.
695,00:50:07.67,00:50:09.88,">> PROBST: So, Jenna's firstoff."
696,00:50:09.88,00:50:12.79,"It comes down to Amber andBoston Rob, and immediately both"
697,00:50:12.79,00:50:16.33,"of you guys look at each otherand say, let's make a deal."
698,00:50:16.33,00:50:18.29,But a deal never ended uphappening.
699,00:50:18.29,00:50:23.62,"Amber, was that because this isa game that has a trust issue?"
700,00:50:23.62,00:50:27.08,>> I will not deny thatnerves were definitely taking

706,00:50:43.17,00:50:44.67,It had to go through your head alittle bit.
707,00:50:44.67,00:50:47.29,">> Yeah, of course itwent through my mind."
708,00:50:47.29,00:50:52.29,"I mean, how can it not.You can tell, even at this stage"
709,00:50:52.29,00:50:57.50,"still there's paranoia. >> PROBST: So, Rob, you have"
710,00:50:57.50,00:51:00.04,immunity.Huge decision.
711,00:51:00.04,00:51:01.75,You can talk about yourrelationship with Amber all you
712,00:51:01.75,00:51:05.00,"want, this is still a game.This is still a strategic"
713,00:51:05.00,00:51:09.46,"decision, one way or another.>> Strategically I mean I"
714,00:51:09.46,00:51:12.83,don't know necessarily that Ieven have a shot of winning

716,00:51:16.33,00:51:18.83,would you be if I came back andthe vote said Amber?
717,00:51:18.83,00:51:21.33,>> I'd probably die of shock.That would be the biggest shock
718,00:51:21.33,00:51:23.88,of my life.But these two are airtight.
719,00:51:23.88,00:51:27.42,And I think it's a lot romanticas it is strategic.
720,00:51:27.42,00:51:29.58,But I think Boston Rob isactually wary of going up
721,00:51:29.58,00:51:33.33,"against Amber in the final two,and his chances with me would be"
722,00:51:33.33,00:51:36.00,better.>> PROBST: How does that make
723,00:51:36.00,00:51:38.50,"you feel, Amber, to hear that?>> I think he's thought"
724,00:51:38.50,00:51:41.83,through every decision 100% theentire time he's been out here.
725,00:51:41.83,00:51:46.92,And whether or not his feelingsfor me help make the decision of
726,00:51:46.92,00:51:52.00,"keeping our alliance together inthis final two, I mean if it was"
727,00:51:52.00,00:51:55.17,"me, there is no decision to bemade."
728,00:51:55.17,00:51:57.50,>> PROBST: So you're able toseparate any romantic feelings
729,00:51:57.50,00:52:01.42,you might have for Rob fromhonoring an alliance that is
730,00:52:01.42,00:52:03.08,about the game?>> Yeah.
731,00:52:03.08,00:52:08.75,I think I've been in control ofmy emotions for Rob and in
732,00:52:08.75,00:52:13.54,control of my strategicdecisions in this game for sure.
733,00:52:13.54,00:52:15.54,">> PROBST: Rob, are you able todo the same thing?"
734,00:52:15.54,00:52:18.17,>> Absolutely.100%.
735,00:52:18.17,00:52:20.92,No doubt about it.>> PROBST: Okay.
736,00:52:20.92,00:52:23.25,Let's get to the vote.Here is how it's going to work.
737,00:52:23.25,00:52:26.00,Boston Rob has immunity.You can't vote for him.
738,00:52:26.00,00:52:29.29,"Jenna, you can only vote forAmber; Amber you can only vote"
739,00:52:29.29,00:52:31.29,"for Jenna; Your votes canceleach other out, so the only"
740,00:52:31.29,00:52:35.00,person who will vote is Rob.With one vote you're going to
741,00:52:35.00,00:52:37.83,vote out the 16th person fromthis game.
742,00:52:37.83,00:52:40.50,But what you are really doingwith that vote is deciding who
743,00:52:40.50,00:52:43.79,you are going to sit next to aspart of the final two.
744,00:52:43.79,00:52:47.50,It's time to make that vote.You're up.

747,00:53:43.96,00:53:46.33,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
748,00:53:46.33,00:53:53.33,"I'll read the vote.The 16th person voted out, and"
749,00:53:53.33,00:53:57.21,the final member of our jury--Jenna.
750,00:53:57.21,00:54:14.67,"Need to bring your torch.Jenna, the tribe has spoken."
751,00:54:28.25,00:54:31.92,"Well, congratulations.You have gone as far as you can"
752,00:54:31.92,00:54:34.29,go in this game.The power now shifts to the
753,00:54:34.29,00:54:37.00,jury.Seven people you had a hand in
754,00:54:37.00,00:54:41.29,voting out now hold your fate intheir hands.
755,00:54:41.29,00:54:44.42,You have one final night inPanama.
756,00:54:44.42,00:54:46.92,"Enjoy it, and I will see youtomorrow for final Tribal"
757,00:54:46.92,00:54:49.96,"Council.Grab your torches, head to camp."
758,00:54:52.25,00:54:55.25,>> This time I'm veryproud of the way I played the
759,00:54:55.25,00:54:57.17,game.I didn't get blind-sided.
760,00:54:57.17,00:55:00.54,"I think I was more observant,more strategic and I had a lot"
761,00:55:00.54,00:55:03.67,"more fun, that's for sure.38 days out of 39, feels pretty"
762,00:55:03.67,00:55:07.17,good.But I'm going to relive that
763,00:55:07.17,00:55:10.29,"stupid foot move for the rest ofmy life, because it's the"
764,00:55:10.29,00:55:35.71,difference of a million dollars.>> To be able to spend 39
765,00:55:35.71,00:55:41.75,"days now with a person whoalways makes you happy, always"
766,00:55:41.75,00:55:47.12,makes you feel completely safein any situation...
767,00:55:49.58,00:55:53.12,always makes you feel importantand proud of yourself is just
768,00:55:53.12,00:55:56.17,amazing.Hey.
769,00:55:56.17,00:55:57.50,>> What?>> We're the final two.
770,00:55:57.50,00:56:00.17,">> I know, I told youthat this afternoon after Jenna"
771,00:56:00.17,00:56:05.08,"stepped off.>> Yeah, but now it's"
772,00:56:05.08,00:56:09.04,like there's nobody else here.It's just you and me.
773,00:56:09.04,00:56:12.25,">> They're gone.>> I came into this game,"
774,00:56:12.25,00:56:14.38,"and within the first couple ofminutes, Rob and I had formed an"
775,00:56:14.38,00:56:17.54,alliance.And over the first couple of
776,00:56:17.54,00:56:21.04,"days there was a lot of flirtinggoing on, and it turned into"
777,00:56:21.04,00:56:24.67,something real.And now we have an amazing bond.
778,00:56:24.67,00:56:28.04,And I'm so glad that that was mystrategy in the beginning
779,00:56:28.04,00:56:30.17,because look what I ended upwith.
780,00:56:30.17,00:56:34.00,>> We came as far as we can.It's not up to us anymore.
781,00:56:34.00,00:56:36.50,"Everything we did, we did it bythe book."
782,00:56:36.50,00:56:39.96,">> It's over, it's overand done with."
783,00:56:44.17,00:56:46.50,">> 15 minutes after thegame started, we were able to"
784,00:56:46.50,00:56:50.71,work as a team.Even when we got separated and
785,00:56:50.71,00:56:52.88,"weren't together, we were stillable to work through it as a"
786,00:56:52.88,00:56:56.50,team.I mean in a game where trust is
787,00:56:56.50,00:57:00.67,"fleeting to have a partnershipwith someone, an alliance with"
788,00:57:00.67,00:57:04.21,"someone that you can trust,that's huge."
789,00:57:04.21,00:57:09.33,"They thought we were, you know,screwing around, flirting,"
790,00:57:09.33,00:57:11.33,da-da-da...>> Little did they know.
791,00:57:11.33,00:57:13.50,>> They never had a clue.They never seen it coming.
792,00:57:13.50,00:57:16.75,">> We were playing thegame, too."
793,00:57:21.54,00:57:24.79,>> They're going to hateus when this is over.
794,00:57:24.79,00:57:29.96,"They're all going to hate us.Well, cheers."
795,00:57:29.96,00:57:33.08,>> Cheers.>> Cheers on our victory.
796,00:57:33.08,00:57:48.08,>> Cheers to us.>> It captured the moment.
797,00:57:48.08,00:57:51.17,>> That's a good one.That's my favorite one.
798,00:57:51.17,00:58:00.17,You look dirty.The game was over.
799,00:58:00.17,00:58:03.21,I mean what a huge relief.What a huge weight off your
800,00:58:03.21,00:58:06.08,shoulders to know that now it'sin the jury's hands.
801,00:58:06.08,00:58:10.50,We're done voting people off.We're done strategizing.
802,00:58:10.50,00:58:15.38,"Now we can just sit back, relaxand enjoy that last day."
803,00:58:15.38,00:58:26.04,And I love that.>> I'm completely at
804,00:58:26.04,00:58:28.25,"peace right now, you know that?>> Mm-hmm, me, too."
805,00:58:28.25,00:58:33.04,I feel... 100% relaxed.I'm not worrying about anything
806,00:58:33.04,00:58:34.88,that's going on tonight.Nothing.
807,00:58:34.88,00:58:37.42,I'm not even thinking about it.I'm sure I will when it gets
808,00:58:37.42,00:58:42.25,"down to it, but right now I'mjust kind of like..."
809,00:58:42.25,00:58:45.08,>> Good picture.>> We're taking in every
810,00:58:45.08,00:58:47.42,last moment.We're not really taking anything
811,00:58:47.42,00:58:51.42,for granted.So going to one of our little
812,00:58:51.42,00:58:55.33,"favorite spots and just enjoyingit one last time, and knowing"
813,00:58:55.33,00:58:59.67,"that nobody else is around, itwas just our island."
814,00:58:59.67,00:59:02.83,"Just a great, great feeling.>> The black one or the"
815,00:59:02.83,00:59:06.00,blue one?>> I don't like the black ones.
816,00:59:06.00,00:59:07.71,>> You don't like the blackones?
817,00:59:07.71,00:59:24.67,">> Well, I mean, not as much.>> Our last fish."
818,00:59:24.67,00:59:27.58,This guy's going to be the lastfish I eat.
819,00:59:27.58,00:59:33.50,Last supper over here today.Last lunch.
820,00:59:33.50,00:59:36.96,I don't know how I ever made itwithout Rupert out here.
821,00:59:36.96,00:59:40.17,Who would have known I couldactually fish and clean them and
822,00:59:40.17,00:59:45.79,cook them and fend for myself.Still alive.
823,00:59:45.79,00:59:49.33,"You know I said in the beginningalso that this game Survivor,"
824,00:59:49.33,00:59:51.62,"was basically like CharlesDarwin's premise, survival of"
825,00:59:51.62,00:59:54.96,the fittest.The species that's best able to
826,00:59:54.96,00:59:58.83,adapt to certain situations willoutlive the others.
827,00:59:58.83,01:00:02.92,"And I think as a team, Amber andI were most able to adapt to"
828,01:00:02.92,01:00:05.79,certain situations.Maybe they'll give us both a
829,01:00:05.79,01:00:10.50,million.>> You never know.
830,01:00:10.50,01:00:13.54,There is a very important nightcoming up.
831,01:00:13.54,01:00:17.25,And there are a lot of anxiouspeople who are really looking
832,01:00:17.25,01:00:20.67,forward to grilling us.I hope I'm not forced into
833,01:00:20.67,01:00:25.29,saying why they should pick meover Rob.
834,01:00:25.29,01:00:28.83,">> See, this time a juryis made up of people who know"
835,01:00:28.83,01:00:32.17,"me, and they know how I am.I'm sure people took this game"
836,01:00:32.17,01:00:37.33,"very, very personal, and that'stheir own frickin' problem."
837,01:00:46.88,01:00:52.58,"I outwitted, I outlasted, and Ifeel I outplayed them all."
838,01:00:52.58,01:00:57.67,The feeling that I have insideme right now is where the
839,01:00:57.67,01:01:03.25,"sleep deprivation, the lack offood, the suffering, the highs,"
840,01:01:03.25,01:01:07.17,"the lows of the game, it's wortheverything."
841,01:01:07.17,01:01:11.38,"Look at these socks.They've been good to us, huh?"
842,01:01:13.38,01:01:16.21,>> The way the day isending with this rain and
843,01:01:16.21,01:01:19.17,"being miserable is, of course,bringing on the miserable"
844,01:01:19.17,01:01:21.46,feelings of going to TribalCouncil.
845,01:01:21.46,01:01:24.50,I think the vibe of the jurytonight is going to be pretty
846,01:01:24.50,01:01:26.67,"cold, you know.They came out here with their"
847,01:01:26.67,01:01:29.29,"second chance, and the factthat they didn't get to finish"
848,01:01:29.29,01:01:31.96,it and we did... I don't thinkthey're going to make this easy
849,01:01:31.96,01:01:34.38,for us at all.I think the jury would love to
850,01:01:34.38,01:01:44.46,see Rob and I squirm.>> It's been quite an
851,01:01:44.46,01:01:48.79,adventure.And now that we're leaving...
852,01:01:48.79,01:01:54.50,"I feel both a little bit ofsadness, but definitely joy."
853,01:01:54.50,01:01:57.29,I did everything I wanted to doout here.
854,01:01:57.29,01:01:59.75,I did it to the best of myability.
855,01:01:59.75,01:02:04.08,I gave 110% every single day.And I'm sitting in the final two
856,01:02:04.08,01:02:07.58,with Amber.I'm proud of the way I played.
857,01:02:07.58,01:02:14.42,And I have no regrets.Bugs are still killing me.
858,01:02:30.88,01:02:33.75,">> PROBST: Amber, Rob.>> Hi, Jeff."
859,01:02:33.75,01:02:41.58,>> Jeff.>> PROBST: Have a seat.
860,01:02:41.58,01:02:49.58,"We'll now bring in your jury--Lex, Kathy, Alicia, Shii Ann,"
861,01:02:49.58,01:02:53.96,"Big Tom, Rupert and Jenna--voted out at the last Tribal"
862,01:02:53.96,01:03:05.42,"Council.Well, congratulations."
863,01:03:05.42,01:03:09.83,"You outwitted, outplayed andoutlasted your 16 other tribe"
864,01:03:09.83,01:03:13.62,"mates.And after 39 long, tough,"
865,01:03:13.62,01:03:17.92,"emotional days, it comes down tothis."
866,01:03:17.92,01:03:21.75,"Tonight, your jury-- sevenpeople that you had a hand in"
867,01:03:21.75,01:03:25.17,voting out-- now hold your fatein their hands.
868,01:03:25.17,01:03:28.33,They will decide which one ofthe two of you walks out of here
869,01:03:28.33,01:03:31.38,with bragging rights as winnerof Survivor: All-Stars and the
870,01:03:31.38,01:03:35.67,million dollar check that goeswith it.
871,01:03:35.67,01:03:38.79,Here's how it's going to work.You'll both get a chance to make
872,01:03:38.79,01:03:41.17,an opening statement.Convince these guys why it
873,01:03:41.17,01:03:43.83,should be you that gets themillion dollars.
874,01:03:43.83,01:03:47.38,The jury will then get theirfirst opportunity to address you
875,01:03:47.38,01:03:51.00,since being voted out.After listening to everything
876,01:03:51.00,01:03:54.38,"that's been said, you'll get afinal comment-- one last chance"
877,01:03:54.38,01:03:57.46,to win them over.Then we'll vote.
878,01:03:57.46,01:04:00.67,Clear?Let's get started.
879,01:04:00.67,01:04:06.71,"Opening comments, Rob.>> All right."
880,01:04:06.71,01:04:12.50,"Obviously, uh, the last 39 dayshave been long, emotional."
881,01:04:12.50,01:04:16.71,"And you're sitting over there,and I guarantee you guys are all"
882,01:04:16.71,01:04:20.54,pissed off to be over there.I didn't want to let personal
883,01:04:20.54,01:04:23.79,relationships interfere in thisgame.
884,01:04:23.79,01:04:27.04,"When the merge happened, I had asituation where I made a promise"
885,01:04:27.04,01:04:30.33,"to someone that I wasn't able tokeep, because of promises I made"
886,01:04:30.33,01:04:33.46,"to some other people.In the end, that's where"
887,01:04:33.46,01:04:36.12,everything started to go southfor me.
888,01:04:36.12,01:04:40.38,"Obviously, when you have a jurythat you have to vote out, it's"
889,01:04:40.38,01:04:43.83,going to come back to haunt youin one way or the other.
890,01:04:43.83,01:04:48.04,But I would like you guys toconsider how I played the game
891,01:04:48.04,01:04:52.25,as a player-- always trying todo well for my team; at the same
892,01:04:52.25,01:04:56.79,"time, trying to look out formyself."
893,01:04:56.79,01:04:59.25,"Thank you.>> PROBST: Thanks, Rob."
894,01:04:59.25,01:05:01.67,"Amber.>> Hi, guys."
895,01:05:01.67,01:05:05.17,"Um, I came into the game sayingthat I knew it was going to be"
896,01:05:05.17,01:05:07.54,"harder, because this timearound, I was going to be"
897,01:05:07.54,01:05:10.21,"playingwith people that I knew, instead"
898,01:05:10.21,01:05:13.46,"of just strangers.And, you know, I said I didn't"
899,01:05:13.46,01:05:16.62,come out here to make friends.I didn't come out here to--
900,01:05:16.62,01:05:19.04,"gosh, you know-- have arelationship with a guy."
901,01:05:19.04,01:05:21.58,"You know, I came out here to wina million dollars."
902,01:05:21.58,01:05:24.38,And little did I know all theselittle bonuses came along with
903,01:05:24.38,01:05:27.17,"it.So, I think the reason why I'm"
904,01:05:27.17,01:05:31.17,"sitting here right now is luck,all of you guys for not voting"
905,01:05:31.17,01:05:33.92,me off and because of myalliance with Rob.
906,01:05:33.92,01:05:36.17,Those are the three things thatgot me here.
907,01:05:36.17,01:05:39.92,And I know that you guysprobably all have sore feelings.
908,01:05:39.92,01:05:44.00,I know I had sore feelings whenI sat in the jury.
909,01:05:44.00,01:05:47.00,I just wanted to let you knowthat I got out of this game what
910,01:05:47.00,01:05:51.33,"I really wanted to do, and I'msatisfied."
911,01:05:51.33,01:05:54.25,">> PROBST: All right.Jury, it's now in your court."
912,01:05:54.25,01:05:57.17,"In a moment, you will get achance to address Rob and Amber"
913,01:05:57.17,01:05:59.71,for the first time since beingvoted out.
914,01:05:59.71,01:06:02.00,I'm going to give you a momentto think about what you want to
915,01:06:02.00,01:06:20.54,say.>> PROBST: Okay.
916,01:06:20.54,01:06:23.33,It is time now for you to faceyour jury.
917,01:06:23.33,01:06:26.17,It's the first time they'vehad a chance to say anything to
918,01:06:26.17,01:06:30.54,"you since being voted out.Lex, you're up first."
919,01:06:36.08,01:06:40.33,">> ""It's just a game.""That's something we probably all"
920,01:06:40.33,01:06:42.92,said a thousand times while wewere out here.
921,01:06:42.92,01:06:45.96,"And I'm sure that for both ofyou, it was an excuse that"
922,01:06:45.96,01:06:49.38,helped wash away the guilt asyou played the game the way that
923,01:06:49.38,01:06:51.79,you played it.You know what?
924,01:06:51.79,01:06:54.50,"That phrase, ""It's just a game""is a big lie."
925,01:06:54.50,01:06:58.67,"It's not just a game.For all of us out here, for all"
926,01:06:58.67,01:07:02.88,"of you, it's life.And the line between game and"
927,01:07:02.88,01:07:07.29,life is not cut and dried.Life blurs into the game
928,01:07:07.29,01:07:12.67,constantly.This game exposes who we are as
929,01:07:12.67,01:07:16.33,people to the core.It's like truth serum.
930,01:07:16.33,01:07:19.50,And I think the way you playthis game is representative of
931,01:07:19.50,01:07:23.17,the kind of person you are.The hardest lesson I learned out
932,01:07:23.17,01:07:25.88,here was about friendship andbetrayal.
933,01:07:25.88,01:07:29.54,And I think the true measure ofa man is what kind of friend he
934,01:07:29.54,01:07:31.88,"is.What kind of a friend are you,"
935,01:07:31.88,01:07:34.54,Rob?What kind of a friend were you
936,01:07:34.54,01:07:37.00,to me?You asked me to do you a favor--
937,01:07:37.00,01:07:39.88,"bro to bro, friend to friend--and I did the only thing I could"
938,01:07:39.88,01:07:42.62,do.And that was to answer the call
939,01:07:42.62,01:07:45.21,of a friend in need.You repaid that by putting a
940,01:07:45.21,01:07:47.83,knife in my back.As far as this game is
941,01:07:47.83,01:07:50.67,"concerned, I lost, and you bothbeat me."
942,01:07:50.67,01:07:53.50,"No sour grapes, no bitterness.With all sincerity, I will"
943,01:07:53.50,01:07:56.62,congratulate both of you forbeing in the final two.
944,01:07:56.62,01:08:00.71,"But as I see it, as good as yourgame was, you sold out your"
945,01:08:00.71,01:08:04.50,"values, you sold out yourcharacter and you sold out your"
946,01:08:04.50,01:08:08.00,friends for a stack ofgreenbacks.
947,01:08:08.00,01:08:11.92,"I hope it was worth it,'cause that money will never be"
948,01:08:11.92,01:08:24.12,enough to buy it all back.>> PROBST: Kathy.
949,01:08:28.21,01:08:32.25,">> Um, when you got offSurvivor: Marquesas, I"
950,01:08:32.25,01:08:36.46,distinctly remember that youwere so concerned about how
951,01:08:36.46,01:08:40.67,"people perceived you.What I ask of you today is,"
952,01:08:40.67,01:08:45.67,"after this game-- where you tookfriends to advance to a place,"
953,01:08:45.67,01:08:50.29,and you killed friendships toget there-- what will people
954,01:08:50.29,01:08:53.29,"think of you now?Are you concerned about it, and"
955,01:08:53.29,01:08:55.83,where is it?>> Yeah.
956,01:08:55.83,01:09:00.62,I'm concerned about it.Uh...
957,01:09:00.62,01:09:04.50,"To be completely honest withyou, I don't know where it is."
958,01:09:04.50,01:09:08.50,I'm still floored by Lex'sthing right now.
959,01:09:08.50,01:09:12.46,"Uh...Here's the thing, Kat."
960,01:09:12.46,01:09:18.50,"Looking back, I'm not 100% surehow I feel about the game"
961,01:09:18.50,01:09:22.29,"anymore.I mean, somewhere along the way,"
962,01:09:22.29,01:09:26.38,"I got caught up with, you know,playing people against each"
963,01:09:26.38,01:09:30.71,other and just doing whatever Ihad to do to get to the end.
964,01:09:30.71,01:09:35.62,"And now, looking back on it, Idefinitely, definitely see it a"
965,01:09:35.62,01:09:39.29,"different way, after Lex'sspeech."
966,01:09:39.29,01:09:44.00,But I wouldn't want people tothink that I intentionally came
967,01:09:44.00,01:09:47.38,out here in this game to ruinfriendships.
968,01:09:47.38,01:09:51.33,I'm not a malicious person.I would not intentionally do
969,01:09:51.33,01:10:00.50,"that to try to hurt anybody.>> Amber, um..."
970,01:10:00.50,01:10:03.92,did you play Rob as a patsy toget to the million?
971,01:10:03.92,01:10:08.17,"And if you get to the millionand after it's all over, are you"
972,01:10:08.17,01:10:11.33,going to have a relationshipwith him?
973,01:10:11.33,01:10:16.29,And it can't be a gray area.It's got to be yes or no.
974,01:10:16.29,01:10:18.83,Or is there going to be a phonecall from Pittsburgh to Boston
975,01:10:18.83,01:10:22.33,"if you have the million?I mean, are you playing him?"
976,01:10:22.33,01:10:26.67,">> I started this gameout, um... flirting with Rob as"
977,01:10:26.67,01:10:30.50,"strategy, for sure.But early on in the game--"
978,01:10:30.50,01:10:33.92,within the first ten days-- Istarted developing feelings.
979,01:10:33.92,01:10:38.00,And I started getting caught upin the security in him and the
980,01:10:38.00,01:10:42.50,emotional support and just theway he made me feel.
981,01:10:42.50,01:10:46.67,"And I will tell you that yes, Ihave a genuine relationship with"
982,01:10:46.67,01:10:50.33,"Rob, and I definitely hope tocontinue our relationship"
983,01:10:50.33,01:10:52.33,afterwards.>> Thank you.
984,01:10:52.33,01:10:54.50,"I mean, thank you for ayes-or-no answer."
985,01:10:54.50,01:10:57.17,"Thank you.Um, Rob, you just need to know"
986,01:10:57.17,01:11:00.75,"that I was crushed, obviously.Look at me."
987,01:11:00.75,01:11:03.50,I've been off this thing for 12days.
988,01:11:03.50,01:11:07.58,You were like a kid to... a son.And I was crushed that you
989,01:11:07.58,01:11:11.50,"didn't address what we had.If you didn't want me around,"
990,01:11:11.50,01:11:14.29,"that's fine.We came, we merged, and we were"
991,01:11:14.29,01:11:16.38,outnumbered.I got it.
992,01:11:16.38,01:11:18.42,I got it.I got that we were outplayed.
993,01:11:18.42,01:11:20.83,I got it.But I just can't imagine any
994,01:11:20.83,01:11:23.96,game in the world where you cancheck your friendships at the
995,01:11:23.96,01:11:26.54,door.It's just not in my chemistry
996,01:11:26.54,01:11:29.50,"and my makeup, and I thought itwasn't in yours."
997,01:11:29.50,01:11:32.17,">> I know.>> So, in 15 minutes, you"
998,01:11:32.17,01:11:35.38,"made an alliance, and you-youruined friendships that took two"
999,01:11:35.38,01:11:39.12,years to build.And it-it-it just... it just
1000,01:11:39.12,01:11:41.67,"crushed me.So, I do congratulate you guys"
1001,01:11:41.67,01:11:44.08,"sincerely for being here,however you got here."
1002,01:11:44.08,01:11:47.33,But I just want you to know thatyou used some friendships as
1003,01:11:47.33,01:11:50.62,stepping stones to get there.And it's been a devilish game.
1004,01:11:50.62,01:11:54.12,"But I think you could have takena parallel course, where these"
1005,01:11:54.12,01:11:57.54,"people wouldn't have been leftin carnage, and they would have"
1006,01:11:57.54,01:12:01.67,been feeling a little bit betterabout their decisions tonight.
1007,01:12:01.67,01:12:03.75,And maybe that's immaturity--I don't know--
1008,01:12:03.75,01:12:06.67,but there was another path rightnext to you-- you didn't see
1009,01:12:06.67,01:12:10.50,it-- that you could have thrownus just an ounce of respect.
1010,01:12:10.50,01:12:13.79,"And this wouldn't be here.So, good luck with it."
1011,01:12:13.79,01:12:22.67,Thanks.>> PROBST: Rupert.
1012,01:12:27.12,01:12:29.50,>> That's an emotionalone to follow.
1013,01:12:29.50,01:12:33.62,"First I want to say hey to youguys and congratulations, and"
1014,01:12:33.62,01:12:38.17,thank you to you both forhelping me get as far as I did.
1015,01:12:38.17,01:12:41.88,"You know, I appreciate it.When we made a pact on day 12,"
1016,01:12:41.88,01:12:44.83,you guys stuck with me.You didn't know me.
1017,01:12:44.83,01:12:48.00,"So what I'd really like to askyou, Amber, what did you really"
1018,01:12:48.00,01:12:52.92,"do to get to the final two, andwhy should I give you my vote?"
1019,01:12:52.92,01:12:55.50,>> To get to the finaltwo I played this game the best
1020,01:12:55.50,01:12:59.12,way I know how.And honestly that was taking it
1021,01:12:59.12,01:13:02.42,"day by day.Um, I faced a lot of obstacles"
1022,01:13:02.42,01:13:04.96,in this game.Obviously there was a time when
1023,01:13:04.96,01:13:09.04,my entire tribe was switched andI was the only one left from the
1024,01:13:09.04,01:13:14.04,"original tribe, and I foughtlike hell to stay in the game,"
1025,01:13:14.04,01:13:17.12,but I kept saying in my headthat this is my second chance at
1026,01:13:17.12,01:13:20.04,a million dollars.And so I guess the main reason
1027,01:13:20.04,01:13:23.38,why I think I played the gamewell is I never lost my focus.
1028,01:13:23.38,01:13:27.46,">> True.So, Rob, why should I give you"
1029,01:13:27.46,01:13:31.00,my vote?>> Because you're a man
1030,01:13:31.00,01:13:33.17,of your word.That's why you should give me
1031,01:13:33.17,01:13:37.50,your vote.( Rupert laughing )
1032,01:13:37.50,01:13:41.46,">> Again, you know,congratulations to both of you."

1035,01:13:52.00,01:13:56.67,"in my opinion, that is thelowest form of standard of play"
1036,01:13:56.67,01:14:02.33,"that you can reach, and you twonot only mastered it, but relied"
1037,01:14:02.33,01:14:06.67,"on it, to get to the final two,and that is the fine art of"
1038,01:14:06.67,01:14:12.04,butt-kissing and ego-stroking.You both did so much of it that
1039,01:14:12.04,01:14:15.33,I couldn't possibly decide whichone of you has got less crap on
1040,01:14:15.33,01:14:19.67,"your lips.Now, you may have outwitted us,"
1041,01:14:19.67,01:14:25.21,outplayed us and outlasted usbut you have not outclassed us.
1042,01:14:25.21,01:14:27.17,Let me ask you both onequestion.
1043,01:14:27.17,01:14:31.04,"And, for this question, I needone answer, and one word and one"
1044,01:14:31.04,01:14:34.17,word only.How would you say you played
1045,01:14:34.17,01:14:39.33,"this game, Rob?>> Competitively."

1052,01:15:08.17,01:15:11.67,"hurt, but as someone who'scompeted with every single"
1053,01:15:11.67,01:15:14.88,"person here, I would like tothrow out there that people in"
1054,01:15:14.88,01:15:18.38,glass houses shouldn't throwstones.
1055,01:15:18.38,01:15:23.17,"I feel like all is fair in loveand war and in Survivor, so"
1056,01:15:23.17,01:15:27.00,"tonight you two are on an even,level, playing ground."
1057,01:15:27.00,01:15:30.38,"I haven't decide who I'm goingto vote for, so I'd like you to"
1058,01:15:30.38,01:15:34.46,"tell me, in all honesty, threereasons why the person sitting"
1059,01:15:34.46,01:15:37.50,next to you deserves to win thatmillion dollars more than you.
1060,01:15:37.50,01:15:42.96,Rob?>> Amber has been the
1061,01:15:42.96,01:15:47.04,truest partner in this game tome that I've ever had.
1062,01:15:47.04,01:15:50.17,I asked her once for herfriendship and she's never
1063,01:15:50.17,01:15:53.83,wavered the entire time we'vebeen out here.
1064,01:15:53.83,01:15:58.50,"Secondly, she never quit onanything she said she was going"
1065,01:15:58.50,01:16:03.17,"to do, whatsoever.And third, her support towards"
1066,01:16:03.17,01:16:07.00,our alliance has beenunprecedented.
1067,01:16:07.00,01:16:10.83,"I mean, I would not be hereright now if it were not for"
1068,01:16:10.83,01:16:14.00,her.I think she played a straight-up
1069,01:16:14.00,01:16:18.00,game and I think she deservesit.
1070,01:16:18.00,01:16:20.96,>> Amber?>> Um...I think-- number
1071,01:16:20.96,01:16:25.42,"one, I thought he ruled in allthe challenges."
1072,01:16:25.42,01:16:28.00,And I thought he was probablythe most-- I think he was the
1073,01:16:28.00,01:16:30.04,most competitive person out herein all the challenges.
1074,01:16:30.04,01:16:36.12,"Um... two, I think in this gameum, in order to get this far,"
1075,01:16:36.12,01:16:42.21,you need to find one personthat you can truly depend on and
1076,01:16:42.21,01:16:44.92,I found that in Rob.I found that I could tell him
1077,01:16:44.92,01:16:49.12,anything and he would neverthink of it as something he
1078,01:16:49.12,01:16:51.29,could use against me in thegame.
1079,01:16:51.29,01:16:55.17,"And then, third, ten or 15minutes into the game, he made"
1080,01:16:55.17,01:16:59.75,"an alliance with me, and hestuck to it, even if he might"
1081,01:16:59.75,01:17:03.08,"have doubted in his head, henever let me know about it."

1116,01:19:02.58,01:19:04.83,goats on the farm.When they get to running the
1117,01:19:04.83,01:19:07.58,"nanny, I castrate them, and Inever seen a boy run a woman"
1118,01:19:07.58,01:19:10.08,"like you did.If that was part of strategy,"
1119,01:19:10.08,01:19:12.21,"that was... you did, you did agood job."
1120,01:19:12.21,01:19:15.58,"So I guess I'm going to say toyou, Amber, uh... I don't know"
1121,01:19:15.58,01:19:18.38,"how I'll vote.So you tell me, why I should"
1122,01:19:18.38,01:19:20.50,give you a million dollars andnot Rob.
1123,01:19:20.50,01:19:23.04,"Just... right straight up.Why should, why should I?"
1124,01:19:23.04,01:19:25.83,>> I knew this questionwas going to be somebody's
1125,01:19:25.83,01:19:29.17,"question, and I think it's thehardest answer to, to... to"
1126,01:19:29.17,01:19:31.25,answer.>> It shouldn't be.
1127,01:19:31.25,01:19:33.29,">> I think it's thehardest question to answer, but"
1128,01:19:33.29,01:19:36.50,"uh, if I'm forced into answeringit, I'm going to be honest,"
1129,01:19:36.50,01:19:38.08,and...>> I'd appreciate that.
1130,01:19:38.08,01:19:40.88,">> Well, I'm just sayingwith Rob sitting next to me, you"
1131,01:19:40.88,01:19:42.83,"know, it's hard to do, but Ithink you guys all deserve it."
1132,01:19:42.83,01:19:44.50,">> Sometimes it's hard tobe honest, Amber."
1133,01:19:44.50,01:19:47.42,I can tell you about that--sometimes it is. I'd just like
1134,01:19:47.42,01:19:50.62,"for tonight, let's be honest.>> So, I think that the"
1135,01:19:50.62,01:19:53.00,reason why I should win thisgame over Rob is because we
1136,01:19:53.00,01:19:55.33,"really didn't break our word toeach other, whereas you and Rob"
1137,01:19:55.33,01:19:57.17,did.Do you understand what I'm
1138,01:19:57.17,01:19:59.04,"trying to say?>> In other words, we just"
1139,01:19:59.04,01:20:02.25,"lied a little bit and me and Roblied a whole lot, or... I mean,"
1140,01:20:02.25,01:20:04.62,I don't understand it.Wha... what... Clarify that last
1141,01:20:04.62,01:20:06.46,"statement. I, um...>> I think that you knew"
1142,01:20:06.46,01:20:09.67,this entire game that youralliance with Rob was much
1143,01:20:09.67,01:20:11.46,stronger than your alliance withme.
1144,01:20:11.46,01:20:14.96,So if you're basing your voteson who had a stronger word and
1145,01:20:14.96,01:20:18.33,"who broke their word, I think Ididn't really break my word as"
1146,01:20:18.33,01:20:22.17,much to you as Rob did.>> Thank you.
1147,01:20:22.17,01:20:26.46,"Hey, brother Rob, I know thatI'm stupid for waiting this long"
1148,01:20:26.46,01:20:29.79,"to make up my mind but, like Isaid, I've been with you from"
1149,01:20:29.79,01:20:33.83,"day one and I mean with you.Rob, uh, why should I vote for"
1150,01:20:33.83,01:20:38.08,"you and not Amber?>> In all fairness, Tom..."
1151,01:20:38.08,01:20:44.33,"the conversation we had beforeyou got kicked off, you and I"
1152,01:20:44.33,01:20:51.04,know inside what really happenedin terms of who said what and
1153,01:20:51.04,01:20:56.17,"who lied about what.And, yeah, I broke the alliance,"
1154,01:20:56.17,01:21:00.88,but you plotted to get me kickedoff beforehand and I found out
1155,01:21:00.88,01:21:04.38,first.So I got rid of you before you
1156,01:21:04.38,01:21:07.17,"had the chance to get rid of me.>> In other words, you"
1157,01:21:07.17,01:21:09.96,voted me off 'cause I was goingto try to kick you off?
1158,01:21:09.96,01:21:13.12,>> You did try to get mekicked off.
1159,01:21:13.12,01:21:15.46,">> All right.Well, I guess that's all, so"
1160,01:21:15.46,01:21:18.50,"with saying that, I just want tosay, no hard feelings."
1161,01:21:18.50,01:21:22.67,">> No hard feelings, Tom.>> Don't be stupid, stupid."
1162,01:21:22.67,01:21:26.08,I may have fell for that once.I fell for it twice.
1163,01:21:26.08,01:21:53.50,Not this time.>> PROBST: Okay.
1164,01:21:53.50,01:21:58.00,A lot was said tonight about howyou two played this game.
1165,01:21:58.00,01:22:00.88,"Some people respected it, othersdidn't at all."
1166,01:22:00.88,01:22:04.00,This is your last chance toconvince them it should be you
1167,01:22:04.00,01:22:08.29,"and not the other person.Amber, we'll start with you."
1168,01:22:08.29,01:22:13.67,">> Well, I came heretonight, expecting this to be"
1169,01:22:13.67,01:22:16.00,"very difficult, 'cause I knowevery single one of you would"
1170,01:22:16.00,01:22:17.50,love to be sitting where I'msitting.
1171,01:22:17.50,01:22:22.75,"I really thought, coming in heretonight, that I learned so much"
1172,01:22:22.75,01:22:26.42,about myself throughout the past39 days.
1173,01:22:26.42,01:22:31.04,"But instead, after tonight Ilearned the most about myself"
1174,01:22:31.04,01:22:35.25,just after these past couple ofminutes.
1175,01:22:35.25,01:22:42.83,I'm not happy what I learnedabout myself and I want you to
1176,01:22:42.83,01:22:49.50,know that I'm going to take awaywhat I learned tonight and apply
1177,01:22:49.50,01:22:52.75,it to my life.I know it's very hard for you
1178,01:22:52.75,01:22:55.50,guys all to express yourfeelings and be completely
1179,01:22:55.50,01:22:59.62,"honest with us, and so I justwanted you to know that in every"
1180,01:22:59.62,01:23:03.71,"answer that I gave tonight, Iwas completely honest with you,"
1181,01:23:03.71,01:23:06.54,"and if that's the most I cangive to you tonight, you have"
1182,01:23:06.54,01:23:11.33,it.That's it.
1183,01:23:11.33,01:23:14.83,>> PROBST: Rob.>> Uh... I guess the
1184,01:23:14.83,01:23:20.00,first thing I want to say isthat I'm sorry to each and every
1185,01:23:20.00,01:23:26.88,one of youse for breakingalliances and friendships and
1186,01:23:26.88,01:23:31.33,"all the pain that you guys mustfeel over there, and to tell you"
1187,01:23:31.33,01:23:35.42,"the truth, I'm not reallyfeeling much better sitting over"
1188,01:23:35.42,01:23:39.62,here right now.Uh...I played the game as hard
1189,01:23:39.62,01:23:43.67,"as I could, but I'd be naive tobe able to sit in one of the"
1190,01:23:43.67,01:23:48.29,last two seats and think thatpeople on that side were gonna
1191,01:23:48.29,01:23:53.88,feel all right about the way Iplayed the game.
1192,01:23:53.88,01:24:02.00,"It got a lot more personal thanI thought it ever would, and"
1193,01:24:02.00,01:24:05.83,"from tonight, I was expecting itto be hard."
1194,01:24:05.83,01:24:11.38,"I wasn't expecting it to benearly as hard as it was, I"
1195,01:24:11.38,01:24:20.67,really wasn't...but... I'm really having a tough
1196,01:24:20.67,01:24:24.00,"time even finding the wordsto tell you the truth,"
1197,01:24:24.00,01:24:29.71,and fumbling over all myanswers. Excuse me.
1198,01:24:29.71,01:24:33.88,Uh...This is not really the time to
1199,01:24:33.88,01:24:37.58,"be screwing it up either, but, Imean I guess I've been screwing"
1200,01:24:37.58,01:24:39.92,"it up for a long time, haven'tI?"
1201,01:24:39.92,01:24:42.12,Maybe we could laugh a littlebit.
1202,01:24:42.12,01:24:48.33,Uh... I had fun...And... I'm sorry.
1203,01:24:48.33,01:24:51.33,"That's all I have to say,really."
1204,01:24:51.33,01:24:55.25,">> PROBST: Only one thing left to do, and that is vote."

1212,01:25:28.00,01:25:30.50,"that both of you should juststep up, be proud of the way you"
1213,01:25:30.50,01:25:34.08,played.You made it to the final two.
1214,01:25:34.08,01:25:37.83,You beat us all.That's my vote-- Boston Rob.
1215,01:25:37.83,01:25:40.54,You do deserve it.You ruled this game physically.
1216,01:25:40.54,01:25:44.50,This is a large sum of money.I hope you win it.
1217,01:25:53.79,01:25:57.67,>> Rob... do youremember back in the middle of
1218,01:25:57.67,01:26:03.33,"the game when you and I shookhands, looked each other in the"
