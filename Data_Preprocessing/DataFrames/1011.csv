1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:03.08,00:00:03.08,"Survivor: >> What are we, junior high,"
3,00:00:05.08,00:00:05.08,Katie? >> PROBST: Janu was fed up with
4,00:00:07.00,00:00:07.00,her tribe. >> If I had something to say
5,00:00:08.71,00:00:08.71,"about you, I swear to God I would come up and say it to your"
6,00:00:10.75,00:00:10.75,face. >> Janu is crazy.
7,00:00:12.08,00:00:12.08,She's a crazy person. >> PROBST: Survivors ready.
8,00:00:16.08,00:00:16.08,At the reward challenge... Go!
9,00:00:17.46,00:00:17.46,...the tribe was randomly split into two teams of four...
10,00:00:20.79,00:00:20.79,Janu going out to help. ...and battled for the chance
11,00:00:23.58,00:00:23.58,to partake in a traditional Palauan feast.
12,00:00:26.88,00:00:26.88,"Janu, Tom, Caryn, Gregg win reward."
13,00:00:31.42,00:00:31.42,( cheering ) And all talk of strategy was
14,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,put on hold as they shared in a feast of local delicacies.
15,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,">> Oh, my gosh, barbecue. >> PROBST: Back at camp,"
16,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,Stephenie realized immunity was more important than ever.
17,00:00:48.04,00:00:48.04,>> I definitely need immunity because apparently I'm the
18,00:00:50.25,00:00:50.25,"strongest girl, and I'm just as much as a threat as any of the"
19,00:00:54.25,00:00:54.25,guys. >> PROBST: At the immunity
20,00:00:55.92,00:00:55.92,challenge... You'll all take a spot in the
21,00:00:57.67,00:00:57.67,"water. As the tide begins to rise,"
22,00:01:00.88,00:01:00.88,your breathing room will decrease.
23,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,One more thing-- first person to bail on this challenge
24,00:01:06.38,00:01:06.38,will be taken to a new beach and abandoned there.
25,00:01:09.71,00:01:09.71,"Begin. After a short struggle, it was"
26,00:01:11.67,00:01:11.67,"Janu that dropped out first. Just like that, Janu is out."
27,00:01:16.12,00:01:16.12,And in the end Tom walked away with the immunity necklace.
28,00:01:18.25,00:01:18.25,That's it. Tom wins immunity.
29,00:01:23.21,00:01:23.21,"Left alone to fend for herself, Janu struggled with obstacles"
30,00:01:26.33,00:01:26.33,"she had never faced before. >> This is very hard, and it's"
31,00:01:30.54,00:01:30.54,very frustrating. >> PROBST: But she surprised
32,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,herself and her mood lifted. >> Right now I'm really happy.
33,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,The moon and my fire. >> PROBST: Back at camp...
34,00:01:43.04,00:01:43.04,>> Stephenie is a bigger threat than Janu.
35,00:01:44.42,00:01:44.42,>> PROBST: ...Gregg led the charge to keep Janu and vote out
36,00:01:47.62,00:01:47.62,Stephenie. >> Stephenie is a physical
37,00:01:49.38,00:01:49.38,"threat. She's got a strong will, she"
38,00:01:51.33,00:01:51.33,wants to win this game. >> We all agreed it was Janu
39,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,"tonight, but for some reason I have a feeling it's me."
40,00:01:56.67,00:01:56.67,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Stephenie's worst fears were"
41,00:01:59.08,00:01:59.08,realized when it became clear that she was next to go.
42,00:02:03.96,00:02:03.96,>> The game is on and eliminating competition is part
43,00:02:06.42,00:02:06.42,"of this game. >> PROBST: Stephenie, do you"
44,00:02:09.17,00:02:09.17,feel you're in a hot seat tonight?
45,00:02:10.50,00:02:10.50,>> ( crying ): I know I am. I guess I showed too much heart
46,00:02:14.92,00:02:14.92,and too much will. >> PROBST: But Janu threw a
47,00:02:18.42,00:02:18.42,wrench in the tribe's plan. >> I would be willing to lay
48,00:02:21.46,00:02:21.46,down my torch so Stephenie can have a chance to stay in the
49,00:02:25.08,00:02:25.08,"game. >> PROBST: Janu, per your"
50,00:02:26.79,00:02:26.79,"wishes, this game is over for you, but you will not go home,"
51,00:02:28.79,00:02:28.79,you'll return and be a part of our jury.
52,00:02:30.21,00:02:30.21,">> Thank you, Jeff. >> PROBST: Seven are left."
53,00:02:34.62,00:02:34.62,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
54,00:03:16.12,00:03:16.12,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> What the hell was that?
55,00:04:01.62,00:04:01.62,">> When I got back, I felt a little uncomfortable."
56,00:04:04.58,00:04:04.58,It's just wrong that they were going to vote me out and this
57,00:04:08.25,00:04:08.25,"girl that doesn't even want to be here, Janu, they're gonna"
58,00:04:11.25,00:04:11.25,"keep around, just because she's easy, you know, later?"
59,00:04:13.79,00:04:13.79,"I'm getting pissed off now. She's not around, she's"
60,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,"basically saying, ""I don't want to be here."""
61,00:04:18.42,00:04:18.42,And she's sitting here saying... I don't know what the hell she
62,00:04:21.42,00:04:21.42,was saying. I couldn't stop her.
63,00:04:23.71,00:04:23.71,I don't know who to trust. I don't know who to talk to.
64,00:04:25.79,00:04:25.79,I almost don't want to talk to anybody.
65,00:04:27.42,00:04:27.42,"I'm not going to shoot myself in the foot, though."
66,00:04:29.54,00:04:29.54,>> But you know what? Let me tell you.
67,00:04:31.25,00:04:31.25,It would have gone the same way. She would have been going home.
68,00:04:34.17,00:04:34.17,>> You think? >> After what happened.
69,00:04:35.04,00:04:35.04,>> I didn't think so. Really? >> We came back to camp.
70,00:04:39.08,00:04:39.08,"Tom played it off like, ""Hey, you know what?"
71,00:04:41.21,00:04:41.21,"We were gonna change our vote,"" and it was just, like, you"
72,00:04:44.21,00:04:44.21,"know, comfort Stephenie, make sure that she feels"
73,00:04:46.04,00:04:46.04,welcome and not disrupt tribe camp.
74,00:04:48.17,00:04:48.17,>> I would like to point something out.
75,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,"My immunity became a moot point tonight since it wasn't used,"
76,00:04:53.04,00:04:53.04,but somebody did earn their own immunity.
77,00:04:55.21,00:04:55.21,"That self-preservation speech. So for tonight, that's yours."
78,00:05:00.00,00:05:00.00,">> Oh, stop it. I didn't earn this."
79,00:05:04.08,00:05:04.08,">> Katie, Tom, myself and Ian, we had a four-strong alliance"
80,00:05:06.21,00:05:06.21,"and now all of a sudden all the tables are turning and I'm,"
81,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,"like, ""What's going on? Who's switching?"""
82,00:05:11.21,00:05:11.21,"I don't know, but whether I go next or not, I will get to the"
83,00:05:15.67,00:05:15.67,bottom of it beforehand. >> That was ridiculous.
84,00:05:26.08,00:05:26.08,>> I'm upset by the fact that we didn't vote Stephenie out when
85,00:05:29.00,00:05:29.00,"we should have, which is the first round, and by keeping her"
86,00:05:31.54,00:05:31.54,"around, she influences the team dynamic and it scares me because"
87,00:05:36.00,00:05:36.00,Stephenie progressing in this game means that Koror
88,00:05:39.21,00:05:39.21,falls apart and starts to stab each other in the back.
89,00:05:50.62,00:05:50.62,">> So, is the four strong gone? Is that..."
90,00:05:55.38,00:05:55.38,"The original four-- me, you, Tom and Ian."
91,00:06:00.54,00:06:00.54,"I mean, who's running the show here, Gregg or Ian?"
92,00:06:03.17,00:06:03.17,Not me. Somebody is. Katie acts like she's my
93,00:06:06.08,00:06:06.08,"friend and I can trust her. And then I go to talk to her,"
94,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,"and she's, like, ""I don't know, I don't know who's leading."""
95,00:06:14.04,00:06:14.04,"She won't tell me anything, so I need to talk to Tom."
96,00:06:17.67,00:06:17.67,">> You know, this game keeps getting shaken up, and you know"
97,00:06:20.04,00:06:20.04,that. >> I know.
98,00:06:22.21,00:06:22.21,>> The promise I made you on day two was that we'd try to ride
99,00:06:25.12,00:06:25.12,"this, but if we got split up, we'd look out for each other."
100,00:06:27.58,00:06:27.58,">> Yeah. >> I swear, I'm still trying to"
101,00:06:28.88,00:06:28.88,look out for you. >> That was totally what...
102,00:06:30.50,00:06:30.50,>> I just can't expose myself. >> Mm-mm.
103,00:06:33.17,00:06:33.17,">> But I'm just, I'm looking for an opening."
104,00:06:35.46,00:06:35.46,">> You're showing yourself way too much as a survivor, is what"
105,00:06:37.71,00:06:37.71,"you are. But, um... >> Yeah."
106,00:06:40.92,00:06:40.92,It just pissed me off to make it this far...
107,00:06:43.12,00:06:43.12,>> I'm looking for a chink in the armor.
108,00:06:45.12,00:06:45.12,>> I know. >> There's a reason why
109,00:06:48.46,00:06:48.46,Stephenie has survived as long as she has.
110,00:06:50.58,00:06:50.58,She's got great instincts. I really see her as one of the
111,00:06:55.00,00:06:55.00,"supreme players. Now she's looking for her way,"
112,00:06:57.04,00:06:57.04,"though, to stay in the game, being the true survivor that she"
113,00:07:00.38,00:07:00.38,"has demonstrated herself to be, um... she's going to start"
114,00:07:03.21,00:07:03.21,working on things and that's a problem.
115,00:07:07.79,00:07:07.79,Probably the safest thing for all is for Stephenie to leave.
116,00:07:13.08,00:07:13.08,">> It sucks, you know? It's scary."
117,00:07:15.54,00:07:15.54,>> I know. >> It's a scary feeling.
118,00:07:20.75,00:07:20.75,>> I think I'm in the same position where I'm gonna be the
119,00:07:23.54,00:07:23.54,threat and they're gonna come after me.
120,00:07:27.38,00:07:27.38,"I've said this to a few people, we're all here."
121,00:07:30.29,00:07:30.29,"I'll say it again. I'm pleading for my life, before"
122,00:07:33.46,00:07:33.46,"we even get to that stage of the game, but my strength in the"
123,00:07:36.92,00:07:36.92,"challenges, it's part of what got us to this point."
124,00:07:39.21,00:07:39.21,Don't penalize it because I didn't hide it.
125,00:07:41.92,00:07:41.92,And nobody has won the million dollars who's been a strong
126,00:07:44.88,00:07:44.88,"winner of any of those rewards. It's always, always somebody"
127,00:07:49.04,00:07:49.04,"else. I'm just saying, keep that in"
128,00:07:51.04,00:07:51.04,"mind. Don't just, I mean, don't give"
129,00:07:53.54,00:07:53.54,"me the ""Tom's a threat, we got to get rid of him"" line."
130,00:07:56.58,00:07:56.58,I'd hate to go under those terms.
131,00:07:58.12,00:07:58.12,"I said, ""Listen, my game was revealed because I was playing"
132,00:08:01.08,00:08:01.08,"real hard for the tribe."" I said, ""Don't hold it against"
133,00:08:04.33,00:08:04.33,"me now and don't make me pay for coming out so strong early."""
134,00:08:07.12,00:08:07.12,"All right, I think we're of one mind."
135,00:08:10.04,00:08:10.04,And I'm just hoping that these people don't hold it against me
136,00:08:13.29,00:08:13.29,"to that level that, uh, I'm finished."
137,00:08:23.08,00:08:23.08,>> What'd you guys think of his little plea this morning?
138,00:08:25.42,00:08:25.42,>> Mm... >> Kind of...
139,00:08:27.25,00:08:27.25,>> I'm not sure it was that encouraging.
140,00:08:30.75,00:08:30.75,">> It totally, it totally, I mean..."
141,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,The fact that he's winning totally makes him a target.
142,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,">> I know, and he's, like, ""Don't make it."
143,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,"No one has ever won..."" >> There's a reason that no"
144,00:08:39.25,00:08:39.25,one's ever won. >> Right.
145,00:08:41.33,00:08:41.33,>> Because they get voted off. >> Right. Exactly.
146,00:08:44.04,00:08:44.04,">> Tom's plea, that did nothing. The plea, you know, ""Oh, I"
147,00:08:48.25,00:08:48.25,"brought this tribe,"" you know? ""Helped this tribe get as far"
148,00:08:51.21,00:08:51.21,"as we got,"" you know? Yeah, whatever-- you're the one"
149,00:08:53.50,00:08:53.50,that said it's an individual game now.
150,00:08:55.12,00:08:55.12,"So that's what we're playing, buddy, sorry."
151,00:08:59.54,00:08:59.54,"I know that I'm aligned with people that are really good,"
152,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,"so to go up against people that are really good in the game,"
153,00:09:04.17,00:09:04.17,"that's a challenge for me. If any time, this would be the"
154,00:09:08.04,00:09:08.04,time to switch over. >> Would you really want to do
155,00:09:14.33,00:09:14.33,"that to Gregg? >> To get farther, I mean..."
156,00:09:19.79,00:09:19.79,">> The person we really need to talk to is Caryn, 'cause she"
157,00:09:22.54,00:09:22.54,could end up going with them. I think it's an awesome idea.
158,00:09:25.75,00:09:25.75,>> It'd be crazy. >> They're already outnumbered.
159,00:09:28.62,00:09:28.62,>> Jenn and Steph and I discussed the fact that we have
160,00:09:34.08,00:09:34.08,"four women and three men here, so we were just kind of"
161,00:09:37.42,00:09:37.42,"entertaining the thought that maybe if we all got together,"
162,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,we could have some power here. >> But we haven't talked to
163,00:09:42.29,00:09:42.29,"Caryn about it, so now I have to discuss it with her."
164,00:09:44.33,00:09:44.33,Say you've got immunity. Who would be the first one you
165,00:09:48.21,00:09:48.21,would want off? >> Mm-hmm.
166,00:09:59.04,00:09:59.04,>> I'll do it if you guys are game.
167,00:10:00.88,00:10:00.88,( all talking at once ) I... I don't think I'm that big
168,00:10:04.71,00:10:04.71,of a threat. No matter how threatening you
169,00:10:07.96,00:10:07.96,"think I am, those three men are more threatening, and, um..."
170,00:10:11.50,00:10:11.50,"if I get voted out next, no matter what kind of"
171,00:10:13.50,00:10:13.50,"relationships they think they have, when it comes to a"
172,00:10:15.50,00:10:15.50,"million dollars, you can think you have the best relationship"
173,00:10:17.50,00:10:17.50,"in the world, doesn't matter. Those guys will take you out."
174,00:10:22.33,00:10:22.33,>> Food. >> Yeah.
175,00:10:25.00,00:10:25.00,">> I can be a good persuader, manipulator, so I work my"
176,00:10:28.17,00:10:28.17,angles when I can and I hope I've shown them all.
177,00:10:30.79,00:10:30.79,"Really. You want, you want to think I'm"
178,00:10:33.75,00:10:33.75,a threat? I'll show you how threatening I
179,00:10:35.33,00:10:35.33,"am. >> Tree mail, anyone?"
180,00:10:46.42,00:10:46.42,>> Tree mail! All right!
181,00:10:49.12,00:10:49.12,">> ""The rewards you play for today mostly involve eating and"
182,00:10:52.17,00:10:52.17,drinking. The only way to the good stuff
183,00:10:55.17,00:10:55.17,"will involve strategic thinking."""
184,00:10:56.17,00:10:56.17,">> Oh, my God. >> Maybe we get money and we buy"
185,00:10:59.46,00:10:59.46,stuff. >> A tree mail came in a

372,00:19:43.46,00:19:43.46,"I have letters from all four of my brothers, my sister-in-law."
373,00:19:48.25,00:19:48.25,"My beautiful nieces and nephews, my parents, my boyfriend."
374,00:19:50.96,00:19:50.96,"I have, like, 12 letters. I come from a great family,"
375,00:19:56.00,00:19:56.00,strong group of people who have always been positive and very
376,00:19:58.96,00:19:58.96,motivational and that's why I am the way I am and it just
377,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,makes me try all the harder just to stay in this game.
378,00:20:06.58,00:20:06.58,"I feel like I've conquered so much, but I want it all."
379,00:20:10.12,00:20:10.12,"I mean, there's been talk, us girls may get together,"
380,00:20:13.25,00:20:13.25,but you can't trust anybody. Having these letters is all the
381,00:20:17.29,00:20:17.29,food and all the energy I need because I will read these
382,00:20:21.38,00:20:21.38,"letters and I will think of these people, and I'll go in"
383,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,there like wildfire and I will win this.
384,00:20:26.62,00:20:26.62,I know it. >> I'm taking a bath.
385,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,>> Whoo! >> Heard it before.
386,00:20:34.17,00:20:34.17,">> Believe it when we see it. Hey, hey, hey."
387,00:20:36.46,00:20:36.46,">> Jeff commented that I reek pretty bad, so today is bath"
388,00:20:39.67,00:20:39.67,"day, in honor of Jeff Probst, who noted that I definitely"
389,00:20:45.33,00:20:45.33,stink. I may need you to help me out.
390,00:21:00.21,00:21:00.21,">> With what, your back? >> Yeah."
391,00:21:03.08,00:21:03.08,"I just can't see it. I have long, monkey arms, but I"
392,00:21:06.12,00:21:06.12,couldn't get all the dirt off my back so I asked Gregg to
393,00:21:09.08,00:21:09.08,"help me out. Thanks, buddy."
394,00:21:13.42,00:21:13.42,">> Filthy, dude. >> Is it coming off?"
395,00:21:17.50,00:21:17.50,">> The picture out there with the men bathing each other,"
396,00:21:20.29,00:21:20.29,loofahing. I think it's pretty comical.
397,00:21:23.42,00:21:23.42,I think they could have asked a girl to loofah their backs
398,00:21:26.21,00:21:26.21,if they wanted to. >> So Ian and Gregg had a little
399,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,moment out in the water. Maybe that's the secret alliance
400,00:21:34.50,00:21:34.50,we don't know about. You never know.
401,00:21:37.21,00:21:37.21,">> Thanks, dude. Had a Grecian bath."
402,00:21:40.08,00:21:40.08,"I think we were totally made fun of for that one, but I'm"
403,00:21:42.54,00:21:42.54,comfortable with my sexuality. It's not a big deal.
404,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,"Hey, can you check my neck and just make sure there's no, like,"
405,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,"real big brown spots back there. >> No, there are and I'm not"
406,00:21:50.50,00:21:50.50,going to clean it for you. But you look nice and clean.
407,00:21:53.46,00:21:53.46,>> Good. >> I know that the target's on
408,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,"me, I know that that's coming. I'm anything but confident in"
409,00:22:09.38,00:22:09.38,"the game. I just, you know, right now I'm"
410,00:22:12.21,00:22:12.21,"in an okay position, but that's going to change this afternoon."
411,00:22:14.21,00:22:14.21,">> Mm-hmm. >> So this is... I mean, you"
412,00:22:17.58,00:22:17.58,"have this alliance and it gets you through to the end,"
413,00:22:21.12,00:22:21.12,but you think Ian wants to deal with me?
414,00:22:22.83,00:22:22.83,You think I want to deal with Ian?
415,00:22:24.83,00:22:24.83,>> Right. >> I know that a lot of the
416,00:22:26.50,00:22:26.50,"tribe members are going to be, like, ""This may be our last"
417,00:22:29.25,00:22:29.25,"chance to take him out. Let's do it right now."""
418,00:22:31.79,00:22:31.79,So I'm prepared for that. My only protection is to keep
419,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,"the five tight, and I've also got to bring in Caryn as a"
420,00:22:39.79,00:22:39.79,confidante. If there's a little trouble
421,00:22:43.33,00:22:43.33,"brewing for me, I want Caryn to think that I'm looking out for"
422,00:22:46.96,00:22:46.96,"her interests, she's looking out for mine."
423,00:22:48.96,00:22:48.96,And I know that the target's on me.
424,00:22:51.42,00:22:51.42,"I still think your good move would be to be, like you say,"
425,00:22:55.08,00:22:55.08,"there's a strong five, be the strong sixth yourself with us."
426,00:22:59.50,00:22:59.50,>> Mm-hmm. >> Talk to me before you make
427,00:23:02.54,00:23:02.54,"that jump. >> Tom is my in right now, and"
428,00:23:04.75,00:23:04.75,"Tom said to me, ""Caryn, I'm going to watch you as long as I"
429,00:23:07.42,00:23:07.42,"can."" He said, ""I want you to go as"
430,00:23:09.92,00:23:09.92,"far as you can."" I feel like you've worked really"
431,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,hard to keep me in the game. I'm just not going to bite the
432,00:23:16.67,00:23:16.67,"hand that's been feeding me. >> All right, well, I appreciate"
433,00:23:19.38,00:23:19.38,that. I think we do have some kind
434,00:23:21.67,00:23:21.67,of a sympathetic thing going where we're going to look out
435,00:23:25.29,00:23:25.29,for each other for the best that we can.
436,00:23:27.29,00:23:27.29,>> Right. >> So it was a good move on my
437,00:23:30.08,00:23:30.08,"part to be friends with Caryn. What happens, happens at this"
438,00:23:32.88,00:23:32.88,"point. You know, you just, you play"
439,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,your cards as best you can. If I don't win the immunity
440,00:23:38.29,00:23:38.29,"challenge, I'll be ready to see my name written a few times."
441,00:23:53.08,00:23:53.08,">> Oh, man. >> PROBST: Okay."
442,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,Let's get to today's immunity challenge.
443,00:23:59.25,00:23:59.25,"First things first, Tom. Give it up."
444,00:24:04.42,00:24:04.42,Immunity once again back up for grabs.
445,00:24:07.67,00:24:07.67,"For today's immunity challenge, you're going to be up on a"
446,00:24:09.50,00:24:09.50,platform. 20 feet away is a wooden grid.
447,00:24:11.79,00:24:11.79,On that grid-- ceramic tiles. There are 35 tiles-- that's five
448,00:24:15.38,00:24:15.38,"tiles for each of you. Using coconuts, you're going to"
449,00:24:19.08,00:24:19.08,toss the coconut and attempt to knock out one of your tiles.
450,00:24:24.58,00:24:24.58,"If you take out somebody else's tile, that counts for them."
451,00:24:28.00,00:24:28.00,First person to break all five of their tiles or have their
452,00:24:31.25,00:24:31.25,tiles broken by somebody else wins immunity.
453,00:24:34.38,00:24:34.38,"Lose, Tribal Council tonight. This game will end for somebody."
454,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,We'll randomly draw for colors. Get your names up on the board
455,00:24:41.25,00:24:41.25,"and we'll get started. All right, Ian."
456,00:24:46.62,00:24:46.62,"You're in the number one slot, going for red."
457,00:24:49.46,00:24:49.46,Choose your weapon. ( sighs )
458,00:24:55.21,00:24:55.21,Goes small. First shot.
459,00:25:04.17,00:25:04.17,"Look at that! >> Oh, man."
460,00:25:05.54,00:25:05.54,">> PROBST: Off the bat, Ian is on the board."
461,00:25:08.83,00:25:08.83,">> Good one. >> PROBST: Katie up, going for"
462,00:25:11.96,00:25:11.96,brown. Launch...!
463,00:25:15.29,00:25:15.29,"Oh. Gregg, looking for a blue tile."
464,00:25:22.58,00:25:22.58,>> Wow! >> PROBST: Gregg takes out his
465,00:25:23.83,00:25:23.83,first tile. Gregg on the board with one.
466,00:25:26.17,00:25:26.17,"Jenn is up, going for orange... >> Thank you!"
467,00:25:32.08,00:25:32.08,>> PROBST: ...and instead she takes out Caryn...
468,00:25:33.83,00:25:33.83,">> Thank you, Jenn. >> PROBST: ...with the white"
469,00:25:35.21,00:25:35.21,"tile. Caryn on the board with one,"
470,00:25:38.08,00:25:38.08,hasn't even taken her first shot.
471,00:25:40.04,00:25:40.04,You could jump into the lead. Going for white.
472,00:25:44.75,00:25:44.75,Just short. Tom.
473,00:25:47.08,00:25:47.08,He's won back-to-back immunities.
474,00:25:48.21,00:25:48.21,Going for green. >> Whoo!
475,00:25:51.88,00:25:51.88,>> PROBST: And instead he takes out Katie.
476,00:25:55.04,00:25:55.04,>> I'm on the board. >> PROBST: Stephenie with her
477,00:25:57.62,00:25:57.62,"first shot going for yellow. >> Oh, my God!"
478,00:26:04.04,00:26:04.04,>> PROBST: And instead she takes out Caryn.
479,00:26:05.54,00:26:05.54,"At the end of one round, here's where we're at: Caryn in the"
480,00:26:09.21,00:26:09.21,"lead with two, taken out by Jenn and Steph."
481,00:26:11.25,00:26:11.25,"Ian, Gregg and Katie with one. Jenn, Tom, Stephenie not yet on"
482,00:26:15.29,00:26:15.29,"the board. Ian back up, looking for red."
483,00:26:23.12,00:26:23.12,And he does it. Ian now with two.
484,00:26:26.29,00:26:26.29,Katie going for brown. >> Damn!
485,00:26:29.92,00:26:29.92,>> PROBST: Katie takes out Jenn. Jenn on the board with one.
486,00:26:34.08,00:26:34.08,"Gregg up, going for blue. And he takes out another Ian"
487,00:26:38.54,00:26:38.54,tile. >> Wow.
488,00:26:40.12,00:26:40.12,>> PROBST: Ian now moves into the lead with three.
489,00:26:43.12,00:26:43.12,"Jenn on the board with one, going for orange."
490,00:26:47.08,00:26:47.08,Looks good... oh! Too short. >> That-a-girl. That-a-girl.
491,00:26:50.17,00:26:50.17,Thank you. >> PROBST: Jenn takes out Tom.
492,00:26:52.50,00:26:52.50,Tom is now on the board with one.
493,00:26:54.50,00:26:54.50,Caryn going for white. >> Whoo!

495,00:27:01.38,00:27:01.38,Katie moving into this game suddenly now with two.
496,00:27:04.54,00:27:04.54,Tom going for green. Look at that.
497,00:27:11.08,00:27:11.08,"Lofts a nice little one in there, Tom now moves into two."
498,00:27:15.25,00:27:15.25,"Jersey still not on the board. >> ""Jersey."""
499,00:27:19.21,00:27:19.21,>> PROBST: For yellow. >> Come on.
500,00:27:22.12,00:27:22.12,>> PROBST: Aw... ( yells )
501,00:27:24.79,00:27:24.79,>> PROBST: Nothing. At the end of two rounds Ian in

504,00:27:35.71,00:27:35.71,Ian going for red. Ian puts himself in very good
505,00:27:42.79,00:27:42.79,"shape with his fourth tile. Katie with two, looking for her"
506,00:27:47.25,00:27:47.25,third. Going for the close one.

508,00:27:55.08,00:27:55.08,"Gregg with one, looking to get his second."
509,00:27:57.75,00:27:57.75,He's going for blue. Look at that.
510,00:28:01.21,00:28:01.21,Drilled it. Gregg now with two.
511,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,Jenn is up. Jenn going for orange.

519,00:28:31.62,00:28:31.62,>> PROBST: Tom now on the board  with three.
520,00:28:34.04,00:28:34.04,Steph going for the corner yellow.

525,00:28:53.25,00:28:53.25,at stake. For the win.
526,00:28:57.92,00:28:57.92,"Oh, no! Yes."

536,00:29:28.42,00:29:28.42,Oh! Hit three tiles and
537,00:29:31.17,00:29:31.17,none of them went out. Ian hoping somebody will
538,00:29:33.62,00:29:33.62,"accidentally take him out, he'll win it."
539,00:29:35.71,00:29:35.71,"Caryn going for white. >> Ooh, short."
540,00:29:40.38,00:29:40.38,>> Bad toss. >> PROBST: Tom with three.
541,00:29:43.96,00:29:43.96,Could move him into a tie with Ian for first.
542,00:29:51.00,00:29:51.00,Going for green. >> Oh!
543,00:29:53.33,00:29:53.33,>> PROBST: And instead he takes out red which is Ian.
544,00:29:55.96,00:29:55.96,Ian wins immunity. >> Thank you.
545,00:29:58.50,00:29:58.50,Thank you guys. >> Damn.
546,00:30:00.71,00:30:00.71,">> PROBST: Steph, your toss doesn't count."
547,00:30:02.88,00:30:02.88,Nobody can catch Ian. Congratulations.
548,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,Ian safe from the vote tonight. Everybody else fair game.
549,00:30:10.04,00:30:10.04,I'll see you at Tribal. ( thunder )
550,00:30:30.17,00:30:30.17,">> So mother nature throws this little curveball and, you know,"
551,00:30:33.08,00:30:33.08,we're gonna have a rainy day. So I think it would be very
552,00:30:36.50,00:30:36.50,funny if the sun breaks out and you just see seven people
553,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,scatter out of the tent in individual groups just going to
554,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,explode with the things that are building up inside them
555,00:30:46.88,00:30:46.88,while we're stuck inside. It's going to be a fun day.
556,00:31:00.33,00:31:00.33,">> The girls want to vote the guys out one by one, so I think"
557,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,they're just going to tell Caryn.
558,00:31:05.62,00:31:05.62,"So I'm, like, are they really going take me and us four really"
559,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,take out the three men? We'll see.
560,00:31:13.38,00:31:13.38,">> Stick with the women and take out the men, or go with the men"
561,00:31:17.12,00:31:17.12,"and take the rest of them, kicking our ass in a big way?"
562,00:31:21.62,00:31:21.62,We have four and they have three.
563,00:31:24.33,00:31:24.33,"I hate to do it, but I knew I'd have to jump ship at some point."
564,00:31:28.08,00:31:28.08,I just didn't know when it would be.
565,00:31:31.67,00:31:31.67,>> Katie asked me if I wanted to make an alliance with the
566,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,"girls. She said, ""There's four of us"
567,00:31:36.25,00:31:36.25,"and three of them and now is the time to do it."""
568,00:31:39.58,00:31:39.58,>> And then we'll just see how it works out from there.
569,00:31:42.62,00:31:42.62,">> Right. >> You know, I love Tom."
570,00:31:45.29,00:31:45.29,>> Yeah. >> I will cry when I have to
571,00:31:47.71,00:31:47.71,"write his name down. >> Me, too."
572,00:31:49.04,00:31:49.04,>> But I've accepted that I'm going to have to write his name
573,00:31:51.42,00:31:51.42,down or else he's going to win. >> I really have to think it
574,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,"through, I mean... I've been down with Tom, so "
575,00:31:57.25,00:31:57.25,this is a whole new thing that  I really have to think about.
576,00:32:01.25,00:32:01.25,"I mean, I don't have, like, the word ""alliance"" with anybody."
577,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,I'm watching out for Tom. Tom is watching out for me.
578,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,>> What's going on? >> I just told you I would tell
579,00:32:09.17,00:32:09.17,you if your name came up and your name is coming up all over
580,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,the place. >> What's going on?
581,00:32:13.25,00:32:13.25,>> Um... >> What do you hear?
582,00:32:15.25,00:32:15.25,>> Just that the girls are talking.
583,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,>> What do the girls say? >> Trying to figure out which
584,00:32:19.25,00:32:19.25,"guy to take out. >> And why are you telling me,"
585,00:32:22.04,00:32:22.04,as opposed to siding with the girls?
586,00:32:24.42,00:32:24.42,">> Because I told you I would. >> Mm-hmm. I understand that,"
587,00:32:27.21,00:32:27.21,"just, but, I mean, you also have to protect your own neck."
588,00:32:30.21,00:32:30.21,"You know that you're safer with me, you must."
589,00:32:32.54,00:32:32.54,>> ( stammering ): I'm just telling you because I promised
590,00:32:35.08,00:32:35.08,you I would tell you. If I heard anything about you
591,00:32:37.54,00:32:37.54,"I said I'd tell you. >> Well, that was Caryn just"
592,00:32:40.04,00:32:40.04,letting me know that the girls are talking about eliminating
593,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,some of the guys and that my name popped up.
594,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,I'm still just a little wary of why Caryn's giving me the
595,00:32:51.00,00:32:51.00,"information, you know, she'd be better off holding on to that"
596,00:32:53.75,00:32:53.75,information and just surprising me.
597,00:32:55.17,00:32:55.17,And Katie said she's ready for me to go?
598,00:32:57.25,00:32:57.25,>> She's not sure. She was just talking.
599,00:33:00.00,00:33:00.00,She was just throwing around possible scenarios.
600,00:33:02.54,00:33:02.54,>> Okay. It's an interesting day here.
601,00:33:04.96,00:33:04.96,"I've got to get off with Ian, do a little planning there, too."
602,00:33:18.50,00:33:18.50,>> I think everybody's starting to play the game and Caryn's
603,00:33:21.21,00:33:21.21,kind of telling stories to everybody and trying to get a
604,00:33:23.71,00:33:23.71,way into a situation where she can be on top.
605,00:33:26.25,00:33:26.25,So my mind's going about four-and-a-half miles a minute
606,00:33:29.62,00:33:29.62,and I'm trying to figure out what the next best move is.
607,00:33:36.25,00:33:36.25,>> Caryn's spreading that you're trying to get all the girls
608,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,against the guys. >> I don't know what the (bleep)
609,00:33:40.67,00:33:40.67,"you're saying. >> I'm, I'm strong."
610,00:33:43.04,00:33:43.04,"Listen, Caryn's spreading a lie. I'm getting really pissed off."
611,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,>> I don't like that. I don't like that she just did
612,00:33:49.58,00:33:49.58,that at all. That really bothers me.
613,00:33:52.50,00:33:52.50,Caryn went back and told Tom I was planning to get all the
614,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,"women, which is not what I was doing."
615,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,"I was just entertaining the thought, but we can't get a"
616,00:34:01.12,00:34:01.12,female alliance together because Caryn sucks.
617,00:34:03.88,00:34:03.88,>> I can go Caryn first. You think it would be better
618,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,to get rid of Caryn than Tom? >> You don't have a chance.
619,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,"I don't have a chance against Tom, I don't think I have a"
620,00:34:12.12,00:34:12.12,"chance against you either, but I'm sticking with you."
621,00:34:14.12,00:34:14.12,"If I can avoid writing your name down until the end,"
622,00:34:16.21,00:34:16.21,"I'm good with that. >> I'm, I'm still 100% true to"
623,00:34:18.38,00:34:18.38,"you, like... >> Yeah, me, too."
624,00:34:20.50,00:34:20.50,"I-I just feel really bad about the Tom thing, if you"
625,00:34:23.00,00:34:23.00,think about it. We should take out Tom.
626,00:34:27.29,00:34:27.29,"I believe Tom stands a huge, good chance that he can win"
627,00:34:30.38,00:34:30.38,"every immunity from here on out, 'cause he's smart and he's"
628,00:34:33.38,00:34:33.38,strong. I just hate for it to be such a
629,00:34:35.38,00:34:35.38,sweep and Tom just takes the whole thing and none of us have
630,00:34:37.38,00:34:37.38,a chance. >> It's not going to happen that
631,00:34:39.46,00:34:39.46,way. >> I think the biggest obstacle
632,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,"is getting Ian on my side. And to vote off Tom, I think I"
633,00:34:46.08,00:34:46.08,"can get Ian to do that, I think. Just, I mean, when are you going"
634,00:34:49.04,00:34:49.04,"to be ready to get rid of Tom? 'Cause every time I bring it up,"
635,00:34:52.12,00:34:52.12,you're like... >> Tom realizes that he's the
636,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,"biggest threat and while I kind of, you know, I kind of"
637,00:34:57.58,00:34:57.58,comforted him through the whole thing.
638,00:35:01.71,00:35:01.71,That's not the whole way it is; for me it's very up in the air.
639,00:35:03.79,00:35:03.79,I just want to make sure you're still good to go.
640,00:35:06.54,00:35:06.54,">> Yeah, absolutely. It's not a question, it's just"
641,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,who I think should go. >> We need to fill the bucket.
642,00:35:14.75,00:35:14.75,">> This is where the game gets really, really difficult."
643,00:35:17.17,00:35:17.17,"Caryn needs to go home, Stephenie needs to go home,"
644,00:35:19.92,00:35:19.92,so my big dilemma today is do I vote Tom out?
645,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,>> I think I'm screwed because I think Ian told Katie that I'm
646,00:35:34.38,00:35:34.38,playing probably both sides of the fence and so I might be in
647,00:35:38.04,00:35:38.04,"trouble. So, I don't know where I am"
648,00:35:41.29,00:35:41.29,right now. >> Stephenie needs to go.
649,00:35:51.29,00:35:51.29,It's already been too much of a Stephenie show.
650,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,"She brings a complexity to the game right now, and the sooner"
651,00:35:58.38,00:35:58.38,"we get rid of her, the easier it is for us to go back to what"
652,00:36:02.79,00:36:02.79,the plan is. Don't mess with the plan.
653,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,Don't mess with the plan. I'm going to get pissed off.
654,00:36:08.96,00:36:08.96,I am going to get so pissed off. >> I feel like this whole game
655,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,I've had stuff hanging over my head and I've made it through
656,00:36:19.00,00:36:19.00,somehow. If these people are smart and
657,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,"they know how to play the game for themselves, their best bet"
658,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,"is to not get rid of me tonight. I've said my peace, I've"
659,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,"planted the seed. If they're smart, Tom will be"
660,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,the next one to go. Whether they choose to go with
661,00:36:35.38,00:36:35.38,"it, that's on them. >> PROBST: We now bring in the"
662,00:37:00.71,00:37:00.71,"members of our jury, Coby and Janu who quit at the last Tribal"
663,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,"Council, but per the rules, will remain a part of this jury and"
664,00:37:07.79,00:37:07.79,will have a vote at the final Tribal Council.
665,00:37:12.25,00:37:12.25,30 days in started with 20. We're down to seven.
666,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,"Ian, is the paranoia starting to drift into camp?"
667,00:37:21.54,00:37:21.54,">> Well, it's starting to creep in."
668,00:37:23.21,00:37:23.21,"I mean, you know, you go to the bathroom and you're, like, ""Hmm,"
669,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"I wonder if anybody's talking about me."""
670,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,"But, uh, all in all, I think it's still a pretty solid"
671,00:37:29.21,00:37:29.21,"group. >> PROBST: Steph, you narrowly"
672,00:37:31.38,00:37:31.38,escaped being voted out at last Tribal Council.
673,00:37:35.12,00:37:35.12,What was the reaction when you got back to camp?
674,00:37:37.46,00:37:37.46,"Because, clearly, this tribe wanted you gone."
675,00:37:40.25,00:37:40.25,">> I thought it was going to be really uncomfortable, but it"
676,00:37:42.25,00:37:42.25,"wasn't. I hear that they have their, you"
677,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"know, plans and stuff, but, um, they made me feel really"
678,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,"comfortable. And, unfortunately, I don't have"
679,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"immunity on my neck, but, um, you know, I'm playing as hard as"
680,00:37:52.17,00:37:52.17,I can and whatever is meant to happen will happen for me.
681,00:37:56.04,00:37:56.04,">> PROBST: You're a part of this group, but you're still a bit"
682,00:37:58.17,00:37:58.17,of an outsider. What's going to happen to this
683,00:38:00.38,00:38:00.38,"group as it dwindles and people start going over to the jury,"
684,00:38:03.71,00:38:03.71,bitter that they're no longer in this happy family?
685,00:38:06.88,00:38:06.88,>> I think it's going to be tough because they haven't
686,00:38:08.88,00:38:08.88,"really had to, like, scramble and start, like, kind of"
687,00:38:11.46,00:38:11.46,"backstabbing yet, so it's really getting intense."
688,00:38:13.54,00:38:13.54,"Like, people are starting to notice."
689,00:38:15.96,00:38:15.96,"I mean, I've been stressed out since the first time I came to"
690,00:38:19.33,00:38:19.33,"Tribal Council, but it's the game."
691,00:38:21.17,00:38:21.17,">> PROBST: Caryn, when did you notice the intensity pick up?"
692,00:38:25.04,00:38:25.04,>> Probably the day after the last Tribal Council.
693,00:38:27.46,00:38:27.46,"I started noticing more people going off and talking,"
694,00:38:31.62,00:38:31.62,"and, you know, I think other people have noticed it, too."
695,00:38:35.92,00:38:35.92,">> PROBST: So if it's you tonight, surprised?"
696,00:38:39.04,00:38:39.04,>> Not all that surprised. I could be the next one.
697,00:38:43.38,00:38:43.38,"You know, you feel like you know what's going on,"
698,00:38:45.21,00:38:45.21,"but at any given time, I might not know what's going on."
699,00:38:47.25,00:38:47.25,">> PROBST: Tom, seems like from early on, you've been somewhat"
700,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,of a leader on this tribe. You certainly haven't held back
701,00:38:53.67,00:38:53.67,at any of these challenges. Was that a conscious decision to
702,00:38:56.75,00:38:56.75,"say ""I'm going for broke. ""I'm going to let them see I'm"
703,00:39:00.21,00:39:00.21,"strong and see how it plays out""?"
704,00:39:01.88,00:39:01.88,">> No. Uh, my doing well in any"
705,00:39:04.04,00:39:04.04,of the challenges became happenstance that I didn't
706,00:39:06.21,00:39:06.21,intend. I thought I was going to hide
707,00:39:10.96,00:39:10.96,"behind being a little older than the crowd, but the need for"
708,00:39:14.08,00:39:14.08,"Koror to beat Ulong was paramount, so I revealed my"
709,00:39:16.92,00:39:16.92,"hand. Um, you know, I hope it's not"
710,00:39:21.21,00:39:21.21,"held against me, and I don't mind that I've come out and"
711,00:39:24.54,00:39:24.54,"played hard, and I'll live with those consequences."
712,00:39:28.17,00:39:28.17,">> PROBST: Okay, Ian, you have the immunity necklace."
713,00:39:31.17,00:39:31.17,"As always, if you felt compelled, you could give it to"
714,00:39:33.46,00:39:33.46,somebody you thought was in trouble.
715,00:39:34.75,00:39:34.75,">> I'm going, I'm going to keep it for myself tonight, Jeff."
716,00:39:37.12,00:39:37.12,">> PROBST: All right, you cannot vote for Ian."
717,00:39:38.12,00:39:38.12,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
718,00:39:39.62,00:39:39.62,"Caryn, you're up. >> You're one of the fiercest"
719,00:39:55.54,00:39:55.54,competitors I've ever met. My heart hurts to let you go.
720,00:40:11.29,00:40:11.29,>> This is absolutely nothing personal.
721,00:40:14.58,00:40:14.58,I'm just voting with the rest of the tribe.
722,00:40:27.29,00:40:27.29,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
723,00:40:41.42,00:40:41.42,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
724,00:40:43.50,00:40:43.50,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
725,00:40:45.96,00:40:45.96,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
726,00:40:50.42,00:40:50.42,The first vote: Caryn.
727,00:40:57.42,00:40:57.42,"Steph. One vote Steph, one vote Caryn."
728,00:41:03.25,00:41:03.25,"Steph. Two votes Steph, one vote"
729,00:41:05.17,00:41:05.17,Caryn. Steph.
730,00:41:09.75,00:41:09.75,"That's three votes Steph, one vote Caryn."
731,00:41:15.17,00:41:15.17,"12th person voted out and the third member of our jury, Steph."
732,00:41:18.92,00:41:18.92,That's four votes. That's enough.
733,00:41:20.67,00:41:20.67,"Bring me your torch. >> Good luck, guys."
734,00:41:29.29,00:41:29.29,">> PROBST: Steph, the tribe has spoken."
735,00:41:34.17,00:41:34.17,>> See ya. >> PROBST: It's time for you to
736,00:41:35.46,00:41:35.46,"go. Well, relatively speaking,"
737,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,"another easy vote. Last Tribal Council, somebody"
