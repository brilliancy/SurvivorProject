9,00:00:20.79,00:00:20.79,Janu going out to help....and battled for the chance
10,00:00:23.58,00:00:23.58,to partake in a traditionalPalauan feast.
11,00:00:26.88,00:00:26.88,"Janu, Tom, Caryn, Gregg winreward."
12,00:00:31.42,00:00:31.42,( cheering )And all talk of strategy was
13,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,put on hold as they shared in afeast of local delicacies.
14,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,">> Oh, my gosh, barbecue.>> PROBST: Back at camp,"
15,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,Stephenie realized immunity wasmore important than ever.
16,00:00:48.04,00:00:48.04,>> I definitely need immunitybecause apparently I'm the
17,00:00:50.25,00:00:50.25,"strongest girl, and I'm just asmuch as a threat as any of the"
18,00:00:54.25,00:00:54.25,guys.>> PROBST: At the immunity

25,00:01:11.67,00:01:11.67,"Janu that dropped out first.Just like that, Janu is out."
26,00:01:16.12,00:01:16.12,And in the end Tom walked awaywith the immunity necklace.
27,00:01:18.25,00:01:18.25,That's it.Tom wins immunity.
28,00:01:23.21,00:01:23.21,"Left alone to fend for herself,Janu struggled with obstacles"
29,00:01:26.33,00:01:26.33,"she had never faced before.>> This is very hard, and it's"
30,00:01:30.54,00:01:30.54,very frustrating.>> PROBST: But she surprised
31,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,herself and her mood lifted.>> Right now I'm really happy.
32,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,The moon and my fire.>> PROBST: Back at camp...
33,00:01:43.04,00:01:43.04,>> Stephenie is a bigger threatthan Janu.

36,00:01:49.38,00:01:49.38,"threat.She's got a strong will, she"
37,00:01:51.33,00:01:51.33,wants to win this game.>> We all agreed it was Janu
38,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,"tonight, but for some reasonI have a feeling it's me."
39,00:01:56.67,00:01:56.67,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council,Stephenie's worst fears were"
40,00:01:59.08,00:01:59.08,realized when it became clearthat she was next to go.
41,00:02:03.96,00:02:03.96,>> The game is on andeliminating competition is part
42,00:02:06.42,00:02:06.42,"of this game.>> PROBST: Stephenie, do you"

44,00:02:10.50,00:02:10.50,>> ( crying ): I know I am.I guess I showed too much heart
45,00:02:14.92,00:02:14.92,and too much will.>> PROBST: But Janu threw a
46,00:02:18.42,00:02:18.42,wrench in the tribe's plan.>> I would be willing to lay
47,00:02:21.46,00:02:21.46,down my torch so Stephenie canhave a chance to stay in the

55,00:04:04.58,00:04:04.58,It's just wrong that they weregoing to vote me out and this
56,00:04:08.25,00:04:08.25,"girl that doesn't even want tobe here, Janu, they're gonna"
57,00:04:11.25,00:04:11.25,"keep around, just because she'seasy, you know, later?"
58,00:04:13.79,00:04:13.79,"I'm getting pissed off now.She's not around, she's"
59,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,"basically saying, ""I don't wantto be here."""
60,00:04:18.42,00:04:18.42,And she's sitting here saying...I don't know what the hell she
61,00:04:21.42,00:04:21.42,was saying.I couldn't stop her.
62,00:04:23.71,00:04:23.71,I don't know who to trust.I don't know who to talk to.
63,00:04:25.79,00:04:25.79,I almost don't want to talk toanybody.
64,00:04:27.42,00:04:27.42,"I'm not going to shoot myselfin the foot, though."
65,00:04:29.54,00:04:29.54,>> But you know what?Let me tell you.
66,00:04:31.25,00:04:31.25,It would have gone the same way.She would have been going home.

69,00:04:39.08,00:04:39.08,"Tom played it off like, ""Hey,you know what?"
70,00:04:41.21,00:04:41.21,"We were gonna change our vote,""and it was just, like, you"
71,00:04:44.21,00:04:44.21,"know, comfort Stephenie,make sure that she feels"
72,00:04:46.04,00:04:46.04,welcome and not disrupt tribecamp.
73,00:04:48.17,00:04:48.17,>> I would like to pointsomething out.
74,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,"My immunity became a moot pointtonight since it wasn't used,"
75,00:04:53.04,00:04:53.04,but somebody did earn their ownimmunity.
76,00:04:55.21,00:04:55.21,"That self-preservation speech.So for tonight, that's yours."
77,00:05:00.00,00:05:00.00,">> Oh, stop it.I didn't earn this."
78,00:05:04.08,00:05:04.08,">> Katie, Tom, myself and Ian,we had a four-strong alliance"
79,00:05:06.21,00:05:06.21,"and now all of a sudden all thetables are turning and I'm,"
80,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,"like, ""What's going on?Who's switching?"""
81,00:05:11.21,00:05:11.21,"I don't know, but whether I gonext or not, I will get to the"
82,00:05:15.67,00:05:15.67,bottom of it beforehand.>> That was ridiculous.
83,00:05:26.08,00:05:26.08,>> I'm upset by the fact that wedidn't vote Stephenie out when
84,00:05:29.00,00:05:29.00,"we should have, which is thefirst round, and by keeping her"
85,00:05:31.54,00:05:31.54,"around, she influences the teamdynamic and it scares me because"
86,00:05:36.00,00:05:36.00,Stephenie progressingin this game means that Koror
87,00:05:39.21,00:05:39.21,falls apart and starts to stabeach other in the back.
88,00:05:50.62,00:05:50.62,">> So, is the four strong gone?Is that..."
89,00:05:55.38,00:05:55.38,"The original four--me, you, Tom and Ian."
90,00:06:00.54,00:06:00.54,"I mean, who's runningthe show here, Gregg or Ian?"
91,00:06:03.17,00:06:03.17,Not me. Somebody is.Katie acts like she's my
92,00:06:06.08,00:06:06.08,"friend and I can trust her.And then I go to talk to her,"
93,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,"and she's, like, ""I don't know,I don't know who's leading."""
94,00:06:14.04,00:06:14.04,"She won't tell me anything,so I need to talk to Tom."
95,00:06:17.67,00:06:17.67,">> You know, this game keepsgetting shaken up, and you know"
96,00:06:20.04,00:06:20.04,that.>> I know.
97,00:06:22.21,00:06:22.21,>> The promise I made you on daytwo was that we'd try to ride
98,00:06:25.12,00:06:25.12,"this, but if we got split up,we'd look out for each other."
99,00:06:27.58,00:06:27.58,">> Yeah.>> I swear, I'm still trying to"
100,00:06:28.88,00:06:28.88,look out for you.>> That was totally what...
101,00:06:30.50,00:06:30.50,>> I just can't expose myself.>> Mm-mm.
102,00:06:33.17,00:06:33.17,">> But I'm just, I'm lookingfor an opening."
103,00:06:35.46,00:06:35.46,">> You're showing yourself waytoo much as a survivor, is what"
104,00:06:37.71,00:06:37.71,"you are. But, um...>> Yeah."
105,00:06:40.92,00:06:40.92,It just pissed me off to makeit this far...
106,00:06:43.12,00:06:43.12,>> I'm looking for a chink inthe armor.
107,00:06:45.12,00:06:45.12,>> I know.>> There's a reason why
108,00:06:48.46,00:06:48.46,Stephenie has survived as longas she has.
109,00:06:50.58,00:06:50.58,She's got great instincts.I really see her as one of the
110,00:06:55.00,00:06:55.00,"supreme players.Now she's looking for her way,"
111,00:06:57.04,00:06:57.04,"though, to stay in the game,being the true survivor that she"
112,00:07:00.38,00:07:00.38,"has demonstrated herself to be,um... she's going to start"
113,00:07:03.21,00:07:03.21,working on things and that's aproblem.
114,00:07:07.79,00:07:07.79,Probably the safest thing forall is for Stephenie to leave.
115,00:07:13.08,00:07:13.08,">> It sucks, you know?It's scary."
116,00:07:15.54,00:07:15.54,>> I know.>> It's a scary feeling.
117,00:07:20.75,00:07:20.75,>> I think I'm in the sameposition where I'm gonna be the
118,00:07:23.54,00:07:23.54,threat and they're gonna comeafter me.
119,00:07:27.38,00:07:27.38,"I've said this to a few people,we're all here."
120,00:07:30.29,00:07:30.29,"I'll say it again.I'm pleading for my life, before"
121,00:07:33.46,00:07:33.46,"we even get to that stage of thegame, but my strength in the"
122,00:07:36.92,00:07:36.92,"challenges, it's part of whatgot us to this point."
123,00:07:39.21,00:07:39.21,Don't penalize it because Ididn't hide it.
124,00:07:41.92,00:07:41.92,And nobody has won the milliondollars who's been a strong
125,00:07:44.88,00:07:44.88,"winner of any of those rewards.It's always, always somebody"
126,00:07:49.04,00:07:49.04,"else.I'm just saying, keep that in"
127,00:07:51.04,00:07:51.04,"mind.Don't just, I mean, don't give"
128,00:07:53.54,00:07:53.54,"me the ""Tom's a threat, we gotto get rid of him"" line."
129,00:07:56.58,00:07:56.58,I'd hate to go under thoseterms.
130,00:07:58.12,00:07:58.12,"I said, ""Listen, my game wasrevealed because I was playing"
131,00:08:01.08,00:08:01.08,"real hard for the tribe.""I said, ""Don't hold it against"
132,00:08:04.33,00:08:04.33,"me now and don't make me pay forcoming out so strong early."""
133,00:08:07.12,00:08:07.12,"All right, I think we're of onemind."
134,00:08:10.04,00:08:10.04,And I'm just hoping that thesepeople don't hold it against me
135,00:08:13.29,00:08:13.29,"to that level that, uh, I'mfinished."
136,00:08:23.08,00:08:23.08,>> What'd you guys think of hislittle plea this morning?
137,00:08:25.42,00:08:25.42,>> Mm...>> Kind of...
138,00:08:27.25,00:08:27.25,>> I'm not sure it was thatencouraging.
139,00:08:30.75,00:08:30.75,">> It totally, it totally, Imean..."
140,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,The fact that he's winningtotally makes him a target.
141,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,">> I know, and he's, like,""Don't make it."
142,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,"No one has ever won..."">> There's a reason that no"
143,00:08:39.25,00:08:39.25,one's ever won.>> Right.
144,00:08:41.33,00:08:41.33,>> Because they get voted off.>> Right. Exactly.
145,00:08:44.04,00:08:44.04,">> Tom's plea, that did nothing.The plea, you know, ""Oh, I"
146,00:08:48.25,00:08:48.25,"brought this tribe,"" you know?""Helped this tribe get as far"
147,00:08:51.21,00:08:51.21,"as we got,"" you know?Yeah, whatever-- you're the one"
148,00:08:53.50,00:08:53.50,that said it's an individualgame now.
149,00:08:55.12,00:08:55.12,"So that's what we're playing,buddy, sorry."
150,00:08:59.54,00:08:59.54,"I know that I'm aligned withpeople that are really good,"
151,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,"so to go up against people thatare really good in the game,"
152,00:09:04.17,00:09:04.17,"that's a challenge for me.If any time, this would be the"
153,00:09:08.04,00:09:08.04,time to switch over.>> Would you really want to do
154,00:09:14.33,00:09:14.33,"that to Gregg?>> To get farther, I mean..."
155,00:09:19.79,00:09:19.79,">> The person we really need totalk to is Caryn, 'cause she"
156,00:09:22.54,00:09:22.54,could end up going with them.I think it's an awesome idea.
157,00:09:25.75,00:09:25.75,>> It'd be crazy.>> They're already outnumbered.
158,00:09:28.62,00:09:28.62,>> Jenn and Steph and Idiscussed the fact that we have
159,00:09:34.08,00:09:34.08,"four women and three men here,so we were just kind of"
160,00:09:37.42,00:09:37.42,"entertaining the thought thatmaybe if we all got together,"
161,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,we could have some power here.>> But we haven't talked to
162,00:09:42.29,00:09:42.29,"Caryn about it, so now I have todiscuss it with her."
163,00:09:44.33,00:09:44.33,Say you've got immunity.Who would be the first one you
164,00:09:48.21,00:09:48.21,would want off?>> Mm-hmm.

166,00:10:00.88,00:10:00.88,( all talking at once )I... I don't think I'm that big
167,00:10:04.71,00:10:04.71,of a threat.No matter how threatening you

374,00:19:56.00,00:19:56.00,strong group of people who havealways been positive and very
375,00:19:58.96,00:19:58.96,motivational and that's whyI am the way I am and it just
376,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,makes me try all the harderjust to stay in this game.
377,00:20:06.58,00:20:06.58,"I feel like I've conquered somuch, but I want it all."
378,00:20:10.12,00:20:10.12,"I mean, there's been talk,us girls may get together,"
379,00:20:13.25,00:20:13.25,but you can't trust anybody.Having these letters is all the
380,00:20:17.29,00:20:17.29,food and all the energy I needbecause I will read these
381,00:20:21.38,00:20:21.38,"letters and I will thinkof these people, and I'll go in"
382,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,there like wildfire and I willwin this.
383,00:20:26.62,00:20:26.62,I know it.>> I'm taking a bath.

391,00:21:06.12,00:21:06.12,couldn't get all the dirt offmy back so I asked Gregg to
392,00:21:09.08,00:21:09.08,"help me out.Thanks, buddy."
393,00:21:13.42,00:21:13.42,">> Filthy, dude.>> Is it coming off?"

395,00:21:20.29,00:21:20.29,loofahing.I think it's pretty comical.
396,00:21:23.42,00:21:23.42,I think they could have askeda girl to loofah their backs
397,00:21:26.21,00:21:26.21,if they wanted to.>> So Ian and Gregg had a little
398,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,moment out in the water.Maybe that's the secret alliance
399,00:21:34.50,00:21:34.50,we don't know about.You never know.
400,00:21:37.21,00:21:37.21,">> Thanks, dude.Had a Grecian bath."
401,00:21:40.08,00:21:40.08,"I think we were totally made funof for that one, but I'm"
402,00:21:42.54,00:21:42.54,comfortable with my sexuality.It's not a big deal.
403,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,"Hey, can you check my neck andjust make sure there's no, like,"
404,00:21:47.83,00:21:47.83,"real big brown spots back there.>> No, there are and I'm not"
405,00:21:50.50,00:21:50.50,going to clean it for you.But you look nice and clean.
406,00:21:53.46,00:21:53.46,>> Good.>> I know that the target's on
407,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,"me, I know that that's coming.I'm anything but confident in"
408,00:22:09.38,00:22:09.38,"the game.I just, you know, right now I'm"
409,00:22:12.21,00:22:12.21,"in an okay position, but that'sgoing to change this afternoon."
410,00:22:14.21,00:22:14.21,">> Mm-hmm.>> So this is... I mean, you"
411,00:22:17.58,00:22:17.58,"have this alliance and it getsyou through to the end,"
412,00:22:21.12,00:22:21.12,but you think Ian wants to dealwith me?
413,00:22:22.83,00:22:22.83,You think I want to deal withIan?
414,00:22:24.83,00:22:24.83,>> Right.>> I know that a lot of the

417,00:22:31.79,00:22:31.79,So I'm prepared for that.My only protection is to keep
418,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,"the five tight, and I've alsogot to bring in Caryn as a"
419,00:22:39.79,00:22:39.79,confidante.If there's a little trouble

430,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,hard to keep me in the game.I'm just not going to bite the
431,00:23:16.67,00:23:16.67,"hand that's been feeding me.>> All right, well, I appreciate"

557,00:31:05.62,00:31:05.62,"So I'm, like, are they reallygoing take me and us four really"
558,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,take out the three men?We'll see.
559,00:31:13.38,00:31:13.38,">> Stick with the women and takeout the men, or go with the men"
560,00:31:17.12,00:31:17.12,"and take the rest of them,kicking our ass in a big way?"
561,00:31:21.62,00:31:21.62,We have four and they havethree.
562,00:31:24.33,00:31:24.33,"I hate to do it, but I knew I'dhave to jump ship at some point."
563,00:31:28.08,00:31:28.08,I just didn't know when it wouldbe.
564,00:31:31.67,00:31:31.67,>> Katie asked me if I wantedto make an alliance with the
565,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,"girls.She said, ""There's four of us"
566,00:31:36.25,00:31:36.25,"and three of them and now is thetime to do it."""
567,00:31:39.58,00:31:39.58,>> And then we'll just see howit works out from there.
568,00:31:42.62,00:31:42.62,">> Right.>> You know, I love Tom."
569,00:31:45.29,00:31:45.29,>> Yeah.>> I will cry when I have to
570,00:31:47.71,00:31:47.71,"write his name down.>> Me, too."
571,00:31:49.04,00:31:49.04,>> But I've accepted that I'mgoing to have to write his name
572,00:31:51.42,00:31:51.42,down or else he's going to win.>> I really have to think it
573,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,"through, I mean...I've been down with Tom, so "
574,00:31:57.25,00:31:57.25,this is a whole new thing that I really have to think about.
575,00:32:01.25,00:32:01.25,"I mean, I don't have, like, theword ""alliance"" with anybody."
576,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,I'm watching out for Tom.Tom is watching out for me.
577,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,>> What's going on?>> I just told you I would tell
578,00:32:09.17,00:32:09.17,you if your name came up andyour name is coming up all over
579,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,the place.>> What's going on?
580,00:32:13.25,00:32:13.25,>> Um...>> What do you hear?
581,00:32:15.25,00:32:15.25,>> Just that the girls aretalking.
582,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,>> What do the girls say?>> Trying to figure out which
583,00:32:19.25,00:32:19.25,"guy to take out.>> And why are you telling me,"
584,00:32:22.04,00:32:22.04,as opposed to siding with thegirls?
585,00:32:24.42,00:32:24.42,">> Because I told you I would.>> Mm-hmm. I understand that,"
586,00:32:27.21,00:32:27.21,"just, but, I mean, you also haveto protect your own neck."
587,00:32:30.21,00:32:30.21,"You know that you're safer withme, you must."
588,00:32:32.54,00:32:32.54,>> ( stammering ): I'm justtelling you because I promised
589,00:32:35.08,00:32:35.08,you I would tell you.If I heard anything about you
590,00:32:37.54,00:32:37.54,"I said I'd tell you.>> Well, that was Caryn just"
591,00:32:40.04,00:32:40.04,letting me know that the girlsare talking about eliminating
592,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,some of the guys and that myname popped up.
593,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,I'm still just a little waryof why Caryn's giving me the
594,00:32:51.00,00:32:51.00,"information, you know, she'd bebetter off holding on to that"
595,00:32:53.75,00:32:53.75,information and just surprisingme.
596,00:32:55.17,00:32:55.17,And Katie said she's ready forme to go?
597,00:32:57.25,00:32:57.25,>> She's not sure.She was just talking.
598,00:33:00.00,00:33:00.00,She was just throwing aroundpossible scenarios.
599,00:33:02.54,00:33:02.54,>> Okay.It's an interesting day here.
600,00:33:04.96,00:33:04.96,"I've got to get off with Ian,do a little planning there, too."
601,00:33:18.50,00:33:18.50,>> I think everybody's startingto play the game and Caryn's
602,00:33:21.21,00:33:21.21,kind of telling stories toeverybody and trying to get a
603,00:33:23.71,00:33:23.71,way into a situation whereshe can be on top.
604,00:33:26.25,00:33:26.25,So my mind's going aboutfour-and-a-half miles a minute
605,00:33:29.62,00:33:29.62,and I'm trying to figure outwhat the next best move is.
606,00:33:36.25,00:33:36.25,>> Caryn's spreading that you'retrying to get all the girls
607,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,against the guys.>> I don't know what the (bleep)
608,00:33:40.67,00:33:40.67,"you're saying.>> I'm, I'm strong."
609,00:33:43.04,00:33:43.04,"Listen, Caryn's spreading a lie.I'm getting really pissed off."
610,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,>> I don't like that.I don't like that she just did
611,00:33:49.58,00:33:49.58,that at all.That really bothers me.
612,00:33:52.50,00:33:52.50,Caryn went back and told TomI was planning to get all the
613,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,"women, which is not what I wasdoing."
614,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,"I was just entertaining thethought, but we can't get a"
615,00:34:01.12,00:34:01.12,female alliance together becauseCaryn sucks.
616,00:34:03.88,00:34:03.88,>> I can go Caryn first.You think it would be better
617,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,to get rid of Caryn than Tom?>> You don't have a chance.
618,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,"I don't have a chance againstTom, I don't think I have a"
619,00:34:12.12,00:34:12.12,"chance against you either,but I'm sticking with you."
620,00:34:14.12,00:34:14.12,"If I can avoid writingyour name down until the end,"
621,00:34:16.21,00:34:16.21,"I'm good with that.>> I'm, I'm still 100% true to"
622,00:34:18.38,00:34:18.38,"you, like...>> Yeah, me, too."
623,00:34:20.50,00:34:20.50,"I-I just feel really badabout the Tom thing, if you"
624,00:34:23.00,00:34:23.00,think about it.We should take out Tom.
625,00:34:27.29,00:34:27.29,"I believe Tom stands a huge,good chance that he can win"
626,00:34:30.38,00:34:30.38,"every immunity from here on out,'cause he's smart and he's"
627,00:34:33.38,00:34:33.38,strong.I just hate for it to be such a
628,00:34:35.38,00:34:35.38,sweep and Tom just takes thewhole thing and none of us have
629,00:34:37.38,00:34:37.38,a chance.>> It's not going to happen that
630,00:34:39.46,00:34:39.46,way.>> I think the biggest obstacle
631,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,"is getting Ian on my side.And to vote off Tom, I think I"
632,00:34:46.08,00:34:46.08,"can get Ian to do that, I think.Just, I mean, when are you going"
633,00:34:49.04,00:34:49.04,"to be ready to get rid of Tom?'Cause every time I bring it up,"
634,00:34:52.12,00:34:52.12,you're like...>> Tom realizes that he's the
635,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,"biggest threat and while I kindof, you know, I kind of"
636,00:34:57.58,00:34:57.58,comforted him through the wholething.
637,00:35:01.71,00:35:01.71,That's not the whole way it is;for me it's very up in the air.
638,00:35:03.79,00:35:03.79,I just want to make sureyou're still good to go.
639,00:35:06.54,00:35:06.54,">> Yeah, absolutely.It's not a question, it's just"
640,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,who I think should go.>> We need to fill the bucket.
641,00:35:14.75,00:35:14.75,">> This is where the game getsreally, really difficult."
642,00:35:17.17,00:35:17.17,"Caryn needs to go home,Stephenie needs to go home,"
643,00:35:19.92,00:35:19.92,so my big dilemma today isdo I vote Tom out?
644,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,>> I think I'm screwed because Ithink Ian told Katie that I'm
645,00:35:34.38,00:35:34.38,playing probably both sides ofthe fence and so I might be in
646,00:35:38.04,00:35:38.04,"trouble.So, I don't know where I am"
647,00:35:41.29,00:35:41.29,right now.>> Stephenie needs to go.
648,00:35:51.29,00:35:51.29,It's already been too muchof a Stephenie show.
649,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,"She brings a complexity to thegame right now, and the sooner"
650,00:35:58.38,00:35:58.38,"we get rid of her, the easierit is for us to go back to what"
651,00:36:02.79,00:36:02.79,the plan is.Don't mess with the plan.
652,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,Don't mess with the plan.I'm going to get pissed off.
653,00:36:08.96,00:36:08.96,I am going to get so pissed off.>> I feel like this whole game
654,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,I've had stuff hanging over myhead and I've made it through
655,00:36:19.00,00:36:19.00,somehow.If these people are smart and
656,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,"they know how to play the gamefor themselves, their best bet"
657,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,"is to not get rid of me tonight.I've said my peace, I've"
658,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,"planted the seed.If they're smart, Tom will be"
659,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,the next one to go.Whether they choose to go with
660,00:36:35.38,00:36:35.38,"it, that's on them.>> PROBST: We now bring in the"
661,00:37:00.71,00:37:00.71,"members of our jury, Coby andJanu who quit at the last Tribal"
662,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,"Council, but per the rules, willremain a part of this jury and"
663,00:37:07.79,00:37:07.79,will have a vote at the finalTribal Council.
664,00:37:12.25,00:37:12.25,30 days in started with 20.We're down to seven.
665,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,"Ian, is the paranoia startingto drift into camp?"
666,00:37:21.54,00:37:21.54,">> Well, it's starting to creepin."
667,00:37:23.21,00:37:23.21,"I mean, you know, you go to thebathroom and you're, like, ""Hmm,"
668,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"I wonder if anybody's talkingabout me."""
669,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,"But, uh, all in all, I thinkit's still a pretty solid"
670,00:37:29.21,00:37:29.21,"group.>> PROBST: Steph, you narrowly"
671,00:37:31.38,00:37:31.38,escaped being voted out at lastTribal Council.
672,00:37:35.12,00:37:35.12,What was the reaction when yougot back to camp?
673,00:37:37.46,00:37:37.46,"Because, clearly, this tribewanted you gone."
674,00:37:40.25,00:37:40.25,">> I thought it was going to bereally uncomfortable, but it"
675,00:37:42.25,00:37:42.25,"wasn't.I hear that they have their, you"
676,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,"know, plans and stuff, but, um,they made me feel really"
677,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,"comfortable.And, unfortunately, I don't have"
678,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"immunity on my neck, but, um,you know, I'm playing as hard as"
679,00:37:52.17,00:37:52.17,I can and whatever is meant tohappen will happen for me.
680,00:37:56.04,00:37:56.04,">> PROBST: You're a part of thisgroup, but you're still a bit"

687,00:38:13.54,00:38:13.54,"Like, people are starting tonotice."
688,00:38:15.96,00:38:15.96,"I mean, I've been stressed outsince the first time I came to"
689,00:38:19.33,00:38:19.33,"Tribal Council, but it's thegame."
