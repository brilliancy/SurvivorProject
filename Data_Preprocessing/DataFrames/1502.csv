2,00:00:02.12,00:00:02.12,Survivor: 16 Americans began the
3,00:00:03.88,00:00:03.88,adventure of a lifetime in modern Shanghai.
4,00:00:08.42,00:00:08.42,They traveled back in time to a remote section of rural China.
5,00:00:13.25,00:00:13.25,"At a Buddhist welcoming ceremony, Leslie was faced with"
6,00:00:16.21,00:00:16.21,a moral dilemma. >> I'm a believer in Jesus
7,00:00:19.08,00:00:19.08,"Christ, and in the Bible it says ""Thou shall not bow down"
8,00:00:22.17,00:00:22.17,"to any other god."" I just couldn't do it."
9,00:00:27.58,00:00:27.58,">> PROBST: The survivors were split into two tribes, Zhan Hu"
10,00:00:31.12,00:00:31.12,and Fei Long. After a heavy storm pounded the
11,00:00:37.08,00:00:37.08,"Zhan Hu tribe, Ashley, the professional wrestler, was down"
12,00:00:43.71,00:00:43.71,"for the count. >> I want to throw up, but"
13,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17,there's just nothing in there. >> PROBST: Chicken was
14,00:00:49.17,00:00:49.17,unimpressed with his tribe. >> You think this here's going
15,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,"to hold up? >> We have to build something,"
16,00:00:53.54,00:00:53.54,"though, so let's stop being negative."
17,00:00:55.46,00:00:55.46,">> I'm giving my opinion and nobody wants it, so I'm done"
18,00:00:58.50,00:00:58.50,"suggesting. >> PROBST: Meanwhile, back at"
19,00:01:01.25,00:01:01.25,"Fei Long, Todd nominated Aaron as tribe leader."
20,00:01:04.08,00:01:04.08,>> We do need someone who is strong and smart.
21,00:01:06.08,00:01:06.08,">> It feels weird, but I think I can do it."
22,00:01:08.88,00:01:08.88,">> I am very, very smart in trying push the leader role"
23,00:01:12.79,00:01:12.79,more so on to Aaron. >> PROBST: At the first immunity
24,00:01:16.33,00:01:16.33,challenge... Neck and neck going into the
25,00:01:18.42,00:01:18.42,swamp. ...Fei Long came out on top...
26,00:01:21.33,00:01:21.33,Fei Long wins immunity! ...sending Zhan Hu to tribal
27,00:01:26.33,00:01:26.33,"council. Anybody here willing to say, ""I"
28,00:01:31.42,00:01:31.42,"will be the leader of this tribe?"""
29,00:01:33.58,00:01:33.58,"There's your leader. Well, now you got two."
30,00:01:36.12,00:01:36.12,Dave and Peih-gee volunteered to lead their tribe.
31,00:01:38.50,00:01:38.50,">> Yes! >> PROBST: And in the end,"
32,00:01:40.67,00:01:40.67,Ashley was spared. First person voted out of 
33,00:01:43.00,00:01:43.00,Survivor: China-- Chicken. >> Damn!
34,00:01:46.17,00:01:46.17,>> PROBST: 15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
35,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,>> The fire pit has to be done properly the first time.
36,00:02:07.96,00:02:07.96,We can't have any more oopsies like we did with the shelter.
37,00:02:12.25,00:02:12.25,"The shelter is one thing. Man, once you do a fire pit,"
38,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,we just got to do it once and  do it right.
39,00:02:17.58,00:02:17.58,"Last night at tribal council, questions came up about"
40,00:02:19.96,00:02:19.96,"leadership. I raised my hand to say, ""Heck, "
41,00:02:22.21,00:02:22.21,"I'll do it."" I didn't want to be in a"
42,00:02:24.67,00:02:24.67,"leadership role, but instead of resisting things like that,"
43,00:02:27.58,00:02:27.58,"especially with the people in my tribe, I think it's"
44,00:02:30.46,00:02:30.46,actually better to embrace it. I think pull this dead pine tree
45,00:02:33.62,00:02:33.62,"out of the way, plopping the bricks down right here."
46,00:02:37.75,00:02:37.75,>> I just kind of don't want to sit next to the woods.
47,00:02:40.33,00:02:40.33,"We could put where our water collection is, and we'll just"
48,00:02:43.29,00:02:43.29,move. >> Yeah.
49,00:02:45.12,00:02:45.12,I think that will be good. >> Uh-uh.
50,00:02:46.58,00:02:46.58,">> I mean, it will really help with the insects."
51,00:02:48.42,00:02:48.42,>> I want more shelter for the fire.
52,00:02:50.08,00:02:50.08,Putting it right there on the edge?
53,00:02:51.58,00:02:51.58,"No, I don't think that's a great idea at all."
54,00:02:53.71,00:02:53.71,Okay. We're moving forward.
55,00:02:56.12,00:02:56.12,I don't want to start belaboring this kind of stuff
56,00:02:59.88,00:02:59.88,because it sucks a lot of time and energy away from getting
57,00:03:02.88,00:03:02.88,stuff done. >> Dave and I work pretty well
58,00:03:06.88,00:03:06.88,together. We both kind of do it in
59,00:03:09.04,00:03:09.04,"different ways, but if anything, we're not being"
60,00:03:13.75,00:03:13.75,"competitive about, like, who can be, like, leader."
61,00:03:16.96,00:03:16.96,>> I'm just trying to explain the sensibility of why I think
62,00:03:19.04,00:03:19.04,it. If someone can think of
63,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17,"something different... >> No, no, you had valid"
64,00:03:22.83,00:03:22.83,reasons for putting it over there.
65,00:03:24.33,00:03:24.33,"And you know what? For me, like, if you have"
66,00:03:26.17,00:03:26.17,"definite experience that it will work better over there, I'll"
67,00:03:28.17,00:03:28.17,totally go with it. >> It seems that Dave is kind
68,00:03:30.50,00:03:30.50,"of the leader, the top guy, and Peih-gee is just below him."
69,00:03:35.21,00:03:35.21,She's kind of like the balance of power.
70,00:03:37.79,00:03:37.79,>> I think we've got like a game plan...
71,00:03:39.58,00:03:39.58,>> We do. >> ...set in place.
72,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83,We can figure out who's going to do what.
73,00:03:45.46,00:03:45.46,"But most important is knowing what the what is, you know."
74,00:03:49.00,00:03:49.00,">> Dave has a lot of good ideas, but if someone questions"
75,00:03:51.71,00:03:51.71,"it or if somebody comes up with their own idea, there is this"
76,00:03:55.17,00:03:55.17,sense that he's probably still going to go with his idea.
77,00:03:59.21,00:03:59.21,>> If we could get our act together and do this fast this
78,00:04:01.58,00:04:01.58,morning and eat before our possible challenge this
79,00:04:04.83,00:04:04.83,"afternoon, we'd be rocking. >> You're wishing really hard,"
80,00:04:08.29,00:04:08.29,"Jaime, I'll tell you that right now."
81,00:04:10.29,00:04:10.29,You're wishing really hard. >> You should wish hard.
82,00:04:14.12,00:04:14.12,">> Okay, fine. >> It could get to the point"
83,00:04:17.50,00:04:17.50,where people start getting fed up and start talking about Dave
84,00:04:20.12,00:04:20.12,and how they don't necessarily think he's a good leader
85,00:04:22.96,00:04:22.96,anymore. >> This is where it begins right
86,00:04:25.12,00:04:25.12,here. (theme song playing)

89,00:06:10.08,00:06:10.08,">> All right, Jean-Robert's snoring goes something like"
90,00:06:12.17,00:06:12.17,this... (imitates Jean-Robert snoring)
91,00:06:17.33,00:06:17.33,"Jean-Robert, we all know he's like the ""D"" student of our"
92,00:06:19.83,00:06:19.83,tribe. He won't do anything.
93,00:06:22.12,00:06:22.12,He gets up and instantly has to lay down because he's so tired.
94,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,">> Oh, man, I'm about to pass out."
95,00:06:37.04,00:06:37.04,>> I will stick with you because you know this game.
96,00:06:40.17,00:06:40.17,">> You're my one alliance, too. You have to have one in this"
97,00:06:42.71,00:06:42.71,game. You have to.
98,00:06:44.58,00:06:44.58,Me and Todd made an alliance that we're going to stick it out
99,00:06:47.00,00:06:47.00,"with each other until the end of this because even though Todd, I"
100,00:06:49.21,00:06:49.21,"think, is very devious, I've been watching him really"
101,00:06:52.25,00:06:52.25,"closely and I think we have a good alliance so far, at"
102,00:06:54.92,00:06:54.92,"least until the merge. >> At some point, should we"
103,00:07:05.62,00:07:05.62,"pull him in as number three? >> Oh, yeah."
104,00:07:08.17,00:07:08.17,>> Because we need someone strong to call our shots.
105,00:07:10.88,00:07:10.88,"We make the plans and he speaks them out, which puts the target"
106,00:07:13.88,00:07:13.88,on him instead of us. >> We decided to pull Aaron
107,00:07:17.33,00:07:17.33,"into our group, so if anyone has to take a rap for anything,"
108,00:07:20.46,00:07:20.46,"then it's going to be on Aaron. >> Obviously, this is about"
109,00:07:24.04,00:07:24.04,"power players, right, and who wants to go the furthest."
110,00:07:27.42,00:07:27.42,We need a three. >> Which is us.
111,00:07:29.96,00:07:29.96,>> Which is us. >> I think that would be smart.
112,00:07:32.25,00:07:32.25,">> Like, I will swear to you guys with my whole life."
113,00:07:38.42,00:07:38.42,">> Three? >> I will, too."
114,00:07:40.79,00:07:40.79,>> Okay. >> Because that's how the game
115,00:07:42.54,00:07:42.54,"is played. You know, you have to."
116,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,">> The final three. >> At that point, I mean, it's"
117,00:07:47.46,00:07:47.46,"sad to say, it's game on. >> I trust."
118,00:07:49.46,00:07:49.46,">> I trust, too. >> Amanda and I have this game"
119,00:07:52.21,00:07:52.21,in our hands. So we have our alliance.
120,00:07:54.67,00:07:54.67,We have exactly what I wanted to come here to do.
121,00:07:57.83,00:07:57.83,">> You guys want to powwow? So, a lot harder than what we"
122,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,"thought, huh? Three sleepless nights, "
123,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,everyone's on edge. Everyone's angry.
124,00:08:06.29,00:08:06.29,We have to get into some sort of routine.
125,00:08:08.54,00:08:08.54,>> Why don't we just all rest? Now's a good time to get
126,00:08:12.71,00:08:12.71,"refreshed. >> Jean-Robert, you need to"
127,00:08:15.29,00:08:15.29,"start pulling your weight. This is what I feel, not"
128,00:08:18.62,00:08:18.62,whether I'm right or wrong. You might want to talk about it.
129,00:08:22.67,00:08:22.67,>> I know that I'm not working as much as I'd like to be able
130,00:08:24.92,00:08:24.92,"to work, just because I've slept a little bit less than"
131,00:08:27.42,00:08:27.42,"everybody, I think. >> Jean-Robert needs to step it"
132,00:08:30.29,00:08:30.29,up. What is up with this guy?
133,00:08:32.08,00:08:32.08,"He knows he's on the chopping block, and it's pretty obvious"
134,00:08:34.58,00:08:34.58,"around camp. He's trying to divert it, but"
135,00:08:37.21,00:08:37.21,we're not buying it. >> The wheels are turning here.
136,00:08:40.17,00:08:40.17,"Believe me, I can contribute probably as valuable of stuff"
137,00:08:44.00,00:08:44.00,"with my mind. But, I mean, as soon as we"
138,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,"start getting food and water and everything, I think you're"
139,00:08:48.83,00:08:48.83,going to find I'm able to contribute a lot more.
140,00:08:51.29,00:08:51.29,I'm considered one of the bad boys of poker.
141,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,And I absolutely am using a similar strategy in this
142,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,Survivor game. I wanted to give the perception
143,00:08:59.04,00:08:59.04,"I was a little bit lazy, so later when I am contributing"
144,00:09:02.17,00:09:02.17,"and putting in the work effort, people are noticing, ""Hey, this"
145,00:09:06.12,00:09:06.12,"guy is doing beyond his normal capabilities."""
146,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00,"I know that I'd like to be able to do a lot more than I am,"
147,00:09:12.04,00:09:12.04,"but, I mean, we've got a great squad."
148,00:09:19.96,00:09:19.96,"Even though it looks like I'm in big trouble right now, it's"
149,00:09:22.33,00:09:22.33,kind of part of the plan. I can only go up from here.
150,00:09:41.96,00:09:41.96,>> Our biggest priority right now are mud bricks.
151,00:09:47.33,00:09:47.33,I have specific goals. We still have some shelter
152,00:09:50.50,00:09:50.50,"stuff to fix, but we have enough shelter."
153,00:09:52.92,00:09:52.92,I think that's all right. The priority now we have flint
154,00:09:56.08,00:09:56.08,is to get a fireplace going. It's a very realistic and
155,00:10:01.96,00:10:01.96,achievable goal today. I want to keep goals achievable.
156,00:10:05.88,00:10:05.88,>> We need seven more. Do you think there's any
157,00:10:17.17,00:10:17.17,possible way to at least start a baby fire?
158,00:10:21.42,00:10:21.42,"If we could get a spark started up, we could put it under"
159,00:10:25.21,00:10:25.21,"something, just keep it alive. >> You know what?"
160,00:10:27.58,00:10:27.58,I would rather get some of it up and then get a fire started.
161,00:10:34.21,00:10:34.21,>> All I asked was to make a little baby fire to make a
162,00:10:37.21,00:10:37.21,"handful of rice for everybody. Instead, we try to build an"
163,00:10:40.25,00:10:40.25,elaborate barbecue pit. I'm not too thrilled about it.
164,00:10:46.12,00:10:46.12,">> Oh, wow, I'm so sorry. I just totally hosed both of"
165,00:10:52.29,00:10:52.29,you. >> That's fine.
166,00:11:14.88,00:11:14.88,">> Ashley. >> Oh, my gosh, what happened?"
167,00:11:18.04,00:11:18.04,>> Dave drops the brick down and splashes her.
168,00:11:21.75,00:11:21.75,>> Obviously he did it on purpose.
169,00:11:24.96,00:11:24.96,"I'd like to go steal the flint, go out there and make me a"
170,00:11:28.12,00:11:28.12,little fire and cook some rice. >> We got the flint last night
171,00:11:34.58,00:11:34.58,"at tribal council, and we haven't even attempted to make a"
172,00:11:37.58,00:11:37.58,fire. And we're starving.
173,00:11:42.04,00:11:42.04,It just seems like we take the longest route possible to make
174,00:11:45.50,00:11:45.50,something happen. I'm losing faith rapidly.
175,00:11:57.21,00:11:57.21,>> Nothing here has wasted energy.
176,00:11:59.88,00:11:59.88,I moved half those stones myself just now.
177,00:12:04.00,00:12:04.00,>> Okay. >> So if you can imagine...
178,00:12:06.12,00:12:06.12,>> So why don't we start the fire...
179,00:12:07.83,00:12:07.83,>> Let me finish. >> ...in the fireplace.
180,00:12:09.83,00:12:09.83,>> Let me finish. Mud bricks yea high.
181,00:12:12.21,00:12:12.21,I'm not stacking mud bricks around a burning fire.
182,00:12:14.29,00:12:14.29,">> Mud bricks or not, you can still try and get the fire"
183,00:12:16.46,00:12:16.46,going before the rain starts falling.
184,00:12:17.54,00:12:17.54,"The rain's going to fall. But you're the leader, and I'm"
185,00:12:19.67,00:12:19.67,going to let you do what you want.
186,00:12:21.38,00:12:21.38,">> I want to have shelter so it stays lit, Ashley."
187,00:12:24.33,00:12:24.33,"How many fires have you built, sweetheart?"
188,00:12:26.46,00:12:26.46,>> I'm just saying. I'm tired.
189,00:12:28.67,00:12:28.67,I'm hungry. >> Who isn't?
190,00:12:31.08,00:12:31.08,">> I just feel like four days later, we don't have anything."
191,00:12:33.83,00:12:33.83,>> I don't want to fight with Ashley.
192,00:12:35.88,00:12:35.88,"If she wants to fight, I can give her a fight."
193,00:12:38.12,00:12:38.12,The rest of the team's great. Ashley...
194,00:12:44.21,00:12:44.21,"Do you need to yell? >> No, I'm not trying to yell."
195,00:12:46.17,00:12:46.17,">> But you are. >> I said, ""I'm tired, I'm"
196,00:12:48.08,00:12:48.08,"thirsty,"" and you said, ""Well, don't you think everyone else"
197,00:12:50.00,00:12:50.00,"is?"" Of course everybody else is."
198,00:12:51.88,00:12:51.88,Did I say they weren't? Why are you trying to make me
199,00:12:54.50,00:12:54.50,sound like I'm just completely...
200,00:12:56.54,00:12:56.54,">> Just keep going. >> Okay, that's what he want me"
201,00:12:59.04,00:12:59.04,"to do. >> No, I don't."
202,00:13:00.83,00:13:00.83,>> Okay. >> I'm not trying to finger
203,00:13:02.33,00:13:02.33,anybody. I want the fire done.
204,00:13:03.88,00:13:03.88,"You're hungry. Ash, stop bitching."
205,00:13:06.54,00:13:06.54,>> I'm not bitching. I just would like to eat today
206,00:13:09.25,00:13:09.25,and I think everybody else is saying the same thing.
207,00:13:18.04,00:13:18.04,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Prepare to get dirty."
208,00:13:26.29,00:13:26.29,Fei Long getting your first look at the new Zhan Hu tribe.
209,00:13:29.58,00:13:29.58,Chicken voted out at the first tribal council.
210,00:13:35.46,00:13:35.46,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's challenge?"
211,00:13:37.83,00:13:37.83,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, here's how"
212,00:13:40.17,00:13:40.17,"it's going to work: you're going to square off, three on"
213,00:13:42.04,00:13:42.04,three. I'm going to release two giant
214,00:13:44.12,00:13:44.12,wooden balls into this mud pit. Your objective is to push
215,00:13:47.62,00:13:47.62,either one of those two balls across your opponents' goal.
216,00:13:50.79,00:13:50.79,"Each time you do, you score a point for your tribe."
217,00:13:53.12,00:13:53.12,First tribe to score two points wins reward.
218,00:13:57.17,00:13:57.17,Want to know what you're playing for?
219,00:13:59.08,00:13:59.08,"To go along with the fire, fishing gear."
220,00:14:03.83,00:14:03.83,"In addition, you will have a fishing boat waiting for you at"
221,00:14:07.00,00:14:07.00,camp. There is one other twist to
222,00:14:10.00,00:14:10.00,this reward that will be revealed after the challenge is
223,00:14:13.29,00:14:13.29,over. Make sense?
224,00:14:17.08,00:14:17.08,>> Yep. >> Yes.
225,00:14:19.17,00:14:19.17,">> Fei Long, because this challenge requires equal"
226,00:14:20.92,00:14:20.92,"numbers of men and women, you have to sit out a man."
227,00:14:24.92,00:14:24.92,"James doesn't even hesitate, points at Todd."
228,00:14:27.96,00:14:27.96,>> I'm the smallest out of us. >> PROBST: You all right with
229,00:14:30.62,00:14:30.62,"that? >> Yep, let's do it."
230,00:14:32.54,00:14:32.54,">> We love you, Todd. >> PROBST: Todd, you're going to"
231,00:14:34.38,00:14:34.38,"take a spot on the bench. First round will be two women,"
232,00:14:36.33,00:14:36.33,one man. Give you a minute to
233,00:14:38.62,00:14:38.62,"strategize, we'll get started. Here we go."
234,00:14:46.25,00:14:46.25,"Just like we like it on Survivor, nice and wet."
235,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,"First round, Aaron, Amanda, Denise taking on Sherea, Erik"
236,00:14:56.00,00:14:56.00,and Jaime. Go!
237,00:15:11.21,00:15:11.21,Aaron's got a free shot. Erik and Sherea are back on him
238,00:15:16.42,00:15:16.42,now. Now it's Amanda with a free run.
239,00:15:21.12,00:15:21.12,Jaime trying to stay on her. The women doing a very good job
240,00:15:26.12,00:15:26.12,for Zhan Hu. Sherea takes Denise down.
241,00:15:34.71,00:15:34.71,Amanda switching balls now. Nobody defending.
242,00:15:39.83,00:15:39.83,Jaime making her way slowly towards the goal.
243,00:15:44.21,00:15:44.21,Aaron having nothing to do with it.
244,00:15:49.17,00:15:49.17,Sherea now getting back in it. Aaron has his arms around
245,00:15:53.92,00:15:53.92,"Jaime and Sherea, takes them both down in the water."
246,00:15:59.21,00:15:59.21,Amanda now trying to take advantage of the situation.
247,00:16:02.79,00:16:02.79,Amanda has a free shot. Sherea now trying to get Amanda
248,00:16:09.04,00:16:09.04,off. Denise puts both arms around
249,00:16:12.42,00:16:12.42,Jaime and pulls her out. Aaron's got a free shot now.
250,00:16:16.29,00:16:16.29,Erik's going to have to defend. Jaime pulls off Denise's shoe
251,00:16:21.21,00:16:21.21,and throws it. Sherea trying pull Amanda's top
252,00:16:28.71,00:16:28.71,completely off. Everybody pulling everybody's
253,00:16:31.92,00:16:31.92,clothes off now. Amanda not letting it get in her
254,00:16:36.75,00:16:36.75,way. Aaron's pulled Erik off the
255,00:16:40.42,00:16:40.42,ball. Amanda has a free shot at the
256,00:16:45.62,00:16:45.62,ball. Fei Long scores first goal!
257,00:16:57.04,00:16:57.04,">> Put your top back on, Amanda! >> PROBST: Even with no top on,"
258,00:17:04.08,00:17:04.08,"Amanda scores for Fei Long. Next round, Jean-Robert, James"
259,00:17:13.29,00:17:13.29,"and Leslie taking on Frosti, Ashley and Dave."
260,00:17:19.58,00:17:19.58,"Fei Long leads 1-0. They score one more point, they"
261,00:17:23.12,00:17:23.12,win. Go!
262,00:17:33.62,00:17:33.62,James and Frosti going at it. Jean-Robert with a free shot at
263,00:17:41.29,00:17:41.29,the ball. Ashley getting in on it now.
264,00:17:47.00,00:17:47.00,James takes Frosti down. Leslie pulling off Dave.
265,00:17:50.71,00:17:50.71,Jean-Robert muscling his way to the end.
266,00:17:55.08,00:17:55.08,Ashley cannot stop him. Frosti jumps on Jean-Robert.
267,00:18:02.00,00:18:02.00,Keeping it wide open for James. Frosti holding on for dear life.
268,00:18:15.12,00:18:15.12,Jean-Robert pulls off Frosti. This is close to being over.
269,00:18:23.25,00:18:23.25,"Fei Long wins! >> We're going fishing tonight,"
270,00:18:27.92,00:18:27.92,baby. (cheers)
271,00:18:34.71,00:18:34.71,">> PROBST: Fei Long, congratulations."
272,00:18:38.12,00:18:38.12,"Two challenges, two wins. Not bad."
273,00:18:41.71,00:18:41.71,You have the ability to make fire.
274,00:18:43.96,00:18:43.96,You have the tools to catch fish.
275,00:18:46.21,00:18:46.21,It should start to change your lives a little bit.
276,00:18:48.79,00:18:48.79,"Now to the twist. Fei Long, because you defeated"
277,00:18:53.21,00:18:53.21,"Zhan Hu, you now get to kidnap one member of their tribe."
278,00:18:59.92,00:18:59.92,That person will come and live with you until the next
279,00:19:02.62,00:19:02.62,immunity challenge. Who are you going to kidnap?
280,00:19:09.62,00:19:09.62,">> Jaime. >> PROBST: All right, Jaime."
281,00:19:14.42,00:19:14.42,"You're going to leave here now. You'll go with Fei Long, live"
282,00:19:16.83,00:19:16.83,at their camp. You will return at the next
283,00:19:19.08,00:19:19.08,immunity challenge and rejoin your tribe.
284,00:19:21.96,00:19:21.96,"There's one more layer to this twist, Jaime-- this is for you."
285,00:19:25.79,00:19:25.79,"It says ""open in private."" When you get to their beach,"
286,00:19:30.25,00:19:30.25,find a private spot and read it. >> Okay.
287,00:19:33.67,00:19:33.67,>> PROBST: Come get it. >> Thank you.
288,00:19:43.33,00:19:43.33,">> PROBST: Zhan Hu, I got nothing for you."
289,00:19:45.54,00:19:45.54,"Get your stuff, head on back to camp."
290,00:19:50.96,00:19:50.96,"Fei Long, take your new tribe member, head on back to camp."
291,00:20:11.92,00:20:11.92,>> I cannot believe it rained this much.
292,00:20:14.04,00:20:14.04,"Like, it didn't seem like it rained this much, did it?"
293,00:20:16.71,00:20:16.71,>> It looks like a natural disaster hit our camp.
294,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,This is basically destroyed. >> It's like somebody just took
295,00:20:27.67,00:20:27.67,all the water from every ocean they could find and just poured
296,00:20:30.83,00:20:30.83,it right on top of us. >> We actually live on the lake
297,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50,"now. >> Oh, my god."
298,00:20:40.08,00:20:40.08,>> At least the bricks are  above the water level.
299,00:20:42.62,00:20:42.62,I'm really happy I took the time to build the pit versus
300,00:20:45.58,00:20:45.58,the fire first because this just goes to show that I actually had
301,00:20:49.17,00:20:49.17,a fairly sound idea and I'm glad I stuck with it and I
302,00:20:51.46,00:20:51.46,"think it was worth the time. Keep this piece, perhaps, right"
303,00:20:54.25,00:20:54.25,over here. >> This is so good.
304,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,Fei Long. >> A fishing boat.
305,00:21:07.33,00:21:07.33,">> So, who's going fishing? >> You are."
306,00:21:09.46,00:21:09.46,>> We are. >> Fei Long tribe.
307,00:21:11.12,00:21:11.12,"At the reward challenge, we won fishing gear and a fishing"
308,00:21:13.58,00:21:13.58,"boat. After the challenge, we picked"
309,00:21:16.04,00:21:16.04,Jaime to kidnap because she is a spot of sunshine in the tribe.
310,00:21:21.21,00:21:21.21,Taking away Jaime from Zhan Hu completely demoralizes them.
311,00:21:31.17,00:21:31.17,">> Yes, we got to keep track of everything."
312,00:21:32.83,00:21:32.83,">> Keep track of everything, because in The Art of War, it"
313,00:21:34.58,00:21:34.58,talks about stealing things from your opponent.
314,00:21:36.62,00:21:36.62,>> Todd is a sharp kid and his head is in the game.
315,00:21:38.96,00:21:38.96,So I want Todd on my side because I think we work well
316,00:21:41.38,00:21:41.38,together as a team. >> Nice to meet you.
317,00:21:44.54,00:21:44.54,>> Jean-Robert. >> Jaime.
318,00:21:47.00,00:21:47.00,>> I just got put with a different tribe.
319,00:21:49.71,00:21:49.71,They picked me and then Jeff gave me this to go with it.
320,00:21:55.08,00:21:55.08,"""Read this note but do not open the bamboo tube."
321,00:22:00.12,00:22:00.12,"Before making an alliance with a neighbor, you must understand"
322,00:22:02.96,00:22:02.96,his intentions. In this sealed tube is a clue to
323,00:22:06.25,00:22:06.25,a hidden immunity idol at the enemy camp.
324,00:22:09.62,00:22:09.62,You must give this sealed clue to a member of this
325,00:22:12.71,00:22:12.71,tribe before you rejoin your own tribe at the next
326,00:22:15.42,00:22:15.42,"immunity challenge."" The note actually has a clue for"
327,00:22:18.83,00:22:18.83,the other team and it lets them know where the immunity idol
328,00:22:23.21,00:22:23.21,"is, so I am allowed to pick any member of the team I want and"
329,00:22:27.33,00:22:27.33,give it to them. >> Now that's a fire.
330,00:22:43.25,00:22:43.25,">> You know, Aaron, you're quick to jump on my ass about"
331,00:22:45.67,00:22:45.67,anything. You know that.
332,00:22:47.12,00:22:47.12,>> I know. We don't like each other.
333,00:22:48.71,00:22:48.71,>> You're not right about that. >> You like me and I don't like
334,00:22:50.62,00:22:50.62,you? >> There you go.
335,00:22:52.38,00:22:52.38,>> Okay. >> Jean-Robert and Aaron got
336,00:22:56.25,00:22:56.25,"into a ridiculous bitch fight. And we were all just like,"
337,00:23:00.75,00:23:00.75,"(sighs), ""In front of the spy? Really?"
338,00:23:03.96,00:23:03.96,Are you just going to give her a map of who doesn't like
339,00:23:06.00,00:23:06.00,"who? Can we not have, like, a little"
340,00:23:08.04,00:23:08.04,solidarity for like two seconds while she's here.
341,00:23:10.25,00:23:10.25,>> Let's go around the camp and ask who's doing a good job.
342,00:23:12.25,00:23:12.25,>> You know what? >> What?
343,00:23:14.17,00:23:14.17,">> I didn't want to do battle with you, but you're making me"
344,00:23:17.25,00:23:17.25,"have no choice. >> When I go back to my team,"
345,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17,"I'm telling them, ""I don't know why the heck we're not winning,"
346,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"because when I've seen what I've seen, we should be"
347,00:23:27.21,00:23:27.21,"winning."" >> I'm going to put four"
348,00:23:33.21,00:23:33.21,bricks in there and then grab some of this mud and just pour
349,00:23:36.25,00:23:36.25,"it in there like mortar, and it will dry and be stable."
350,00:23:40.04,00:23:40.04,">> So, what should I have done? >> Break up some wood."
351,00:23:45.88,00:23:45.88,>> All of this has to be broken down.
352,00:23:48.17,00:23:48.17,"All that should be broken down. >> All right, let me do one"
353,00:23:50.21,00:23:50.21,thing at a time. I get overwhelmed.
354,00:23:52.04,00:23:52.04,I don't like that. >> It's all the same thing.
355,00:23:54.25,00:23:54.25,It's the one thing. I'm showing you three different
356,00:23:56.21,00:23:56.21,"spots to find it, that's all. >> You don't have to be mean to"
357,00:23:58.21,00:23:58.21,me. Why do you have to have such an
358,00:24:00.00,00:24:00.00,attitude sometimes? >> It's not overwhelming.
359,00:24:03.38,00:24:03.38,I'm telling you where to find the resources for the one thing
360,00:24:06.12,00:24:06.12,"you're doing. >> Okay, but you're doing it"
361,00:24:07.88,00:24:07.88,"with an attitude. I don't know why, it just comes"
362,00:24:10.12,00:24:10.12,"naturally. >> Okay, I apologize."
363,00:24:12.29,00:24:12.29,">> You're always like grr, grr, grr."
364,00:24:14.33,00:24:14.33,>> Apologies. >> Can I finish my sentence?
365,00:24:17.50,00:24:17.50,>> After you interrupted me when I was talking mine?
366,00:24:19.79,00:24:19.79,>> I'm literally just asking you what you want me to do.
367,00:24:22.54,00:24:22.54,>> I do think that Dave is wrong in the way he talks down to
368,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,"Ashley, telling her what to do, you know?"
369,00:24:29.08,00:24:29.08,"You can't boss adults around, really, not too much, without"
370,00:24:32.50,00:24:32.50,pissing them off. >> Can we both right now get
371,00:24:35.83,00:24:35.83,this pile and this pile done? >> But where are we going to
372,00:24:39.54,00:24:39.54,get it done to? >> I said it already this
373,00:24:41.79,00:24:41.79,morning at least a couple times. >> Is there any dry place in
374,00:24:43.96,00:24:43.96,this entire area that we could...
375,00:24:46.25,00:24:46.25,>> Think outside the box. Critical and analytical
376,00:24:48.00,00:24:48.00,thinking really helps. >> I don't need your life
377,00:24:49.75,00:24:49.75,lessons. I just need you to tell me what
378,00:24:51.08,00:24:51.08,to do. >> Later.
379,00:24:55.33,00:24:55.33,>> Adios. >> I believe that Dave's going
380,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,to shoot himself in the foot. He's not a good leader because
381,00:25:01.08,00:25:01.08,he's the most irritating person on the planet.
382,00:25:03.08,00:25:03.08,"He's just so patronizing. >> The last few days, I have"
383,00:25:25.21,00:25:25.21,been really sick. I just feel dirty.
384,00:25:28.67,00:25:28.67,I feel miserable. It's just hard because I don't
385,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,have my Bible. I know if I could read it and
386,00:25:34.21,00:25:34.21,"just spend some time with God, it would be great."
387,00:25:37.21,00:25:37.21,"But I mean, he has me here for a reason, so I'm going to keep"
388,00:25:40.42,00:25:40.42,fighting. >> My strategy as far as the
389,00:25:45.79,00:25:45.79,clue goes is I'm going to give it to whom I think is their
390,00:25:49.62,00:25:49.62,"weakest link, just so I keep their team weaker. "
391,00:26:09.25,00:26:09.25,>> Don't let anybody know you have it.
392,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,>> Okay. >> I feel like the Lord really
393,00:26:13.25,00:26:13.25,gave me a gift with the clue to the hidden immunity idol.
394,00:26:16.38,00:26:16.38,"Wow, this is a really big deal. ""Hidden immunity idol clue"
395,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,number one. What is thought to be hidden
396,00:26:26.17,00:26:26.17,"may sometimes be seen. Though their eyes are not, "
397,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,"yours must be keen."" Hmm."
398,00:26:32.58,00:26:32.58,I feel really confident that I can find the hidden immunity
399,00:26:35.12,00:26:35.12,"idol. In the clue, it said it's"
400,00:26:37.50,00:26:37.50,"obvious. And I think, you know, this is"
401,00:26:39.75,00:26:39.75,probably something you see every day and would never consider
402,00:26:41.88,00:26:41.88,that it would be a hidden immunity idol. 
403,00:27:04.21,00:27:04.21,">> I'm looking everywhere for the hidden immunity idol,"
404,00:27:06.62,00:27:06.62,looking for something that would be obvious.
405,00:27:09.12,00:27:09.12,"My mom used to always say, ""If it was a snake, it would have"
406,00:27:11.12,00:27:11.12,"bit you."" And I feel like that's what it's"
407,00:27:12.71,00:27:12.71,"like. Like, if it was a snake, it"
408,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,would have bit me by now. I think what I really want do
409,00:27:17.00,00:27:17.00,"with this information I have is use it to gain's someone trust,"
410,00:27:20.29,00:27:20.29,"so it has to be someone who's witty, somebody who can think"
411,00:27:23.21,00:27:23.21,"and Todd's pretty witty. So, I want to team up with him."
412,00:27:33.25,00:27:33.25,>> It said that is was obvious. I told Todd the idol is here.
413,00:27:36.21,00:27:36.21,So we're going to team up and use it together.
414,00:27:40.54,00:27:40.54,And I trust him. >> Okay.
415,00:27:42.92,00:27:42.92,"Here comes some people, so..."
416,00:27:44.92,00:27:44.92,">> Morning, guys. >> I can't believe she told me."
417,00:27:48.33,00:27:48.33,I'm in shock. I would never tell anybody.
418,00:27:50.71,00:27:50.71,"What was she thinking? Leslie's sick, so if she goes,"
419,00:27:54.21,00:27:54.21,I'll be the only one that knows about it.
420,00:27:56.79,00:27:56.79,"So my goal is to find that thing as fast as I can, and if"
421,00:27:58.96,00:27:58.96,"Leslie gets sick and has to leave, I'm the only one that"
422,00:28:01.04,00:28:01.04,knows about it. Fantastic.
423,00:28:10.29,00:28:10.29,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Back for more punishment."
424,00:28:19.62,00:28:19.62,"Fei Long, come on in. So, Jaime, tell me about your"
425,00:28:29.62,00:28:29.62,"time at Fei Long. >> Well, they made it the best"
426,00:28:32.75,00:28:32.75,"it could be, so I appreciate it. >> PROBST: Jaime, your time over"
427,00:28:35.79,00:28:35.79,there is done. Get back over to Zhan Hu.
428,00:28:38.12,00:28:38.12,(applause) You guys ready to get to
429,00:28:44.00,00:28:44.00,"today's challenge? First things first-- Amanda,"
430,00:28:47.25,00:28:47.25,I'll take back the immunity idol.
431,00:28:53.08,00:28:53.08,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
432,00:28:56.08,00:28:56.08,"For today's challenge, each tribe will use a large Chinese"
433,00:29:00.54,00:29:00.54,puzzle log to smash through two tribe-colored walls.
434,00:29:06.04,00:29:06.04,"Once you're through both walls, you must then maneuver the log"
435,00:29:09.38,00:29:09.38,through the maze carved into the outside of the puzzle log.
436,00:29:13.04,00:29:13.04,First tribe to get their log through the maze and ring the
437,00:29:15.54,00:29:15.54,"gong wins immunity, safe from tonight's tribal council."
438,00:29:20.12,00:29:20.12,"Losers, another person will be voted out."
439,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,Make sense? Because this challenge runs six
440,00:29:26.21,00:29:26.21,"on six, both tribes will be sitting people out."
441,00:29:29.88,00:29:29.88,"Zhan Hu, you have one extra member."
442,00:29:31.67,00:29:31.67,Who are you going to sit out? >> Jaime will sit out.
443,00:29:33.79,00:29:33.79,>> PROBST: Jaime's going to sit out.
444,00:29:35.29,00:29:35.29,"Fei Long, you have two extra members, who are you going to"
445,00:29:37.21,00:29:37.21,sit out? >> Courtney and Leslie.
446,00:29:39.75,00:29:39.75,>> PROBST: Courtney and Leslie.
447,00:29:41.12,00:29:41.12,"Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize and we'll"
448,00:29:43.17,00:29:43.17,get started. Here we go.
449,00:29:46.42,00:29:46.42,"For immunity, survivors ready. Go!"
450,00:30:04.88,00:30:04.88,Both tribes with good rhythm.
451,00:30:09.38,00:30:09.38,Fei Long working together well. Fei Long is through first.
452,00:30:18.17,00:30:18.17,Zhan Hu go. Both tribes through.
453,00:30:23.12,00:30:23.12,Fei Long with a bit of a lead. >> We got four.
454,00:30:26.92,00:30:26.92,">> Hold on, hold on. Ready, one, two, three!"
455,00:30:36.62,00:30:36.62,>> PROBST: Fei Long has a good rhythm.
456,00:30:39.12,00:30:39.12,Working together well. Zhan Hu wearing out.
457,00:30:41.67,00:30:41.67,Dave can barely move that log anymore.
458,00:30:45.58,00:30:45.58,Frosti bringing up the rear. Fei Long doing great work on
459,00:30:50.50,00:30:50.50,their wall. You're through!
460,00:30:55.17,00:30:55.17,"Fei Long is through. >> Keep it up, guys."
461,00:31:00.25,00:31:00.25,>> PROBST: That log is throwing Dave around.
462,00:31:02.25,00:31:02.25,"Zhan Hu wearing out. >> Dave, switch with me."
463,00:31:04.62,00:31:04.62,">> Pick it up, Dave. >> PROBST: Frosti switching with"
464,00:31:07.00,00:31:07.00,"Dave. Dave, get a hold of the log."
465,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,Get it. You're still in it!
466,00:31:13.46,00:31:13.46,Fei Long working together as a tribe.
467,00:31:16.75,00:31:16.75,">> Get it up there, get it up there."
468,00:31:20.12,00:31:20.12,>> Listen to Aaron. Listen to Aaron.
469,00:31:24.50,00:31:24.50,>> PROBST: You guys need dig deep.
470,00:31:26.62,00:31:26.62,Let's go. There you go.
471,00:31:28.71,00:31:28.71,You're through. Zhan Hu's through.
472,00:31:31.58,00:31:31.58,">> Come on, guys! You guys better run."
473,00:31:35.75,00:31:35.75,>> PROBST: Fei Long already working.
474,00:31:37.46,00:31:37.46,Zhan Hu now catching up. It only goes through one way.
475,00:31:46.33,00:31:46.33,>> Keep going around. >> PROBST: Fei Long with a bit
476,00:31:48.71,00:31:48.71,of a lead. Zhan Hu trying to catch up.
477,00:31:56.38,00:31:56.38,Fei Long reaches a dead end. They got to back it up now.
478,00:32:00.71,00:32:00.71,">> Forward, back, back, back. >> PROBST: Zhan Hu now in the"
479,00:32:03.83,00:32:03.83,"lead. >> Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up."
480,00:32:06.71,00:32:06.71,>> PROBST: Fei Long taking their time.
481,00:32:09.04,00:32:09.04,Nobody panicking on Fei Long. >> It's a dead end here.
482,00:32:17.04,00:32:17.04,>> PROBST: Zhan Hu reaches a dead end.
483,00:32:18.79,00:32:18.79,">> Left. >> There, go back."
484,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,>> PROBST: Fei Long in the lead again.
485,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,"Keep moving, Zhan Hu, keep moving!"
486,00:32:27.08,00:32:27.08,Zhan Hu falling behind. Fei Long is very close.
487,00:32:31.29,00:32:31.29,Fei Long is through. Fei Long wins immunity!
488,00:32:42.75,00:32:42.75,"All right. Fei Long, once again, immunity"
489,00:32:45.12,00:32:45.12,is yours. (applause)
490,00:32:51.04,00:32:51.04,"Nobody going home from Fei Long. Zhan Hu, all I got for you is"
491,00:32:55.12,00:32:55.12,"another date with me tonight at tribal council, where one of the"
492,00:32:57.79,00:32:57.79,seven of you will be voted out of this game.
493,00:33:00.83,00:33:00.83,You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be.
494,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,Head on back to camp. See you at tribal.
495,00:33:06.25,00:33:06.25,"Fei Long, head on out, guys. Nice work."
496,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,">> I feel really bad because, you know, we blew it today, and"
497,00:33:39.29,00:33:39.29,I feel like I let the tribe down.
498,00:33:43.96,00:33:43.96,Can I say something really quick?
499,00:33:46.21,00:33:46.21,Please? I apologize.
500,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,I feel like I let us down today because I lost my footing and I
501,00:33:53.21,00:33:53.21,"lost my rhythm, trying to get my rhythm back, I lost my power."
502,00:33:56.62,00:33:56.62,">> Dave, you tried, but you know what..."
503,00:33:58.62,00:33:58.62,">> I'm sorry. And Frosti, thank you so much"
504,00:34:01.21,00:34:01.21,for stepping up and seeing what was happening and switching
505,00:34:03.75,00:34:03.75,with me. I take full responsibility for
506,00:34:06.12,00:34:06.12,"the challenge today. At the same time, the last six"
507,00:34:09.92,00:34:09.92,days haven't been about one challenge.
508,00:34:12.92,00:34:12.92,It's been about day in and day out in camp and how you
509,00:34:16.38,00:34:16.38,contribute and what your attitude's like.
510,00:34:26.08,00:34:26.08,I'm fairly confident how things are going to go this evening.
511,00:34:29.25,00:34:29.25,"You know, you reap what you sew. Nothing's carved in stone yet,"
512,00:34:32.67,00:34:32.67,but I'm pretty confident I'm not going home.
513,00:34:39.96,00:34:39.96,>> I know that Dave is voting for me at tonight's tribal
514,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,"council. At this point, I see my options"
515,00:34:47.21,00:34:47.21,"are this: I can either confront everybody, act like a crazy"
516,00:34:50.71,00:34:50.71,woman and say (inaudible) and make myself look like an
517,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,"idiot, or I could keep my head together, go to tribal council"
518,00:34:58.25,00:34:58.25,"and tell everyone, like, ""Look, Dave is a crazy person."""
519,00:35:04.21,00:35:04.21,">> I feel like if there's such conflict with Dave and Ashley,"
520,00:35:08.46,00:35:08.46,"you know, if people are targeting Ashley for that"
521,00:35:11.08,00:35:11.08,"reason, I guess it also makes Dave a target."
522,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,"If you had to pick between those two, you might think"
523,00:35:17.42,00:35:17.42,"Dave, but I still see him as strong."
524,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,Remove one of them and the other one can stay around.
525,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,See what I'm saying? It's probably dead even
526,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,between Ashley and Dave. It puts me in a hard place
527,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,"because Ashley is my friend, but then Dave's such hard worker"
528,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,and he knows what he's doing out here.
529,00:35:47.62,00:35:47.62,So I'm not really sure what's going to happen tonight.
530,00:36:21.54,00:36:21.54,">> PROBST: So, last time we were here, we did a little"
531,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,"tribe therapy, and it appeared that you had at least one"
532,00:36:27.38,00:36:27.38,"leader, maybe two. Frosti, how is that leadership"
533,00:36:29.46,00:36:29.46,"working out? >> Well, Dave's really stepped"
534,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,up. He was already giving some
535,00:36:34.79,00:36:34.79,"leadership-type demands, and he's really trying to do"
536,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,"everything. At times, I fear he may attempt"
537,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,too much. >> It's a hard habit to kick.
538,00:36:43.54,00:36:43.54,">> PROBST: Ashley, you were rolling your eyes."
539,00:36:46.25,00:36:46.25,">> Well, Dave and I kind of butt heads sort of."
540,00:36:49.33,00:36:49.33,Our personalities just don't mesh well.
541,00:36:51.75,00:36:51.75,"But I respect him as a leader, and when I have questions, I'll"
542,00:36:54.50,00:36:54.50,"ask them, even if I'm not supposed to."
543,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,">> PROBST: And Dave, that rubs you the wrong way?"
544,00:37:00.12,00:37:00.12,>> It doesn't rub me the wrong way at all.
545,00:37:02.12,00:37:02.12,Everyone is totally welcome to ask questions.
546,00:37:03.96,00:37:03.96,"If you're unclear on something, then please do ask."
547,00:37:06.62,00:37:06.62,Because all I want to do is get camp life fully squared away.
548,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,">> I don't expect Dave to say, ""Well, yeah, that's the way it's"
549,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,"been."" That's what he does-- he goes"
550,00:37:14.46,00:37:14.46,off on rants and patronizes and talks down to you and treats
551,00:37:17.12,00:37:17.12,"you like a child. >> PROBST: Ashley, do you think"
552,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,"this is just about you, or do you notice it with other people,"
553,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,as well? >> I notice that other people
554,00:37:25.29,00:37:25.29,"have a problem with it as well. Dave talks in circles a lot,"
555,00:37:29.00,00:37:29.00,and he always wants to be the martyr.
556,00:37:31.50,00:37:31.50,"The way he handles that leadership, it's just, for me,"
557,00:37:35.25,00:37:35.25,it's intolerable. >> I'm incredibly rusty at
558,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"leadership, too. This is a brand new boat for"
559,00:37:39.96,00:37:39.96,me. It's been a long time.
560,00:37:43.21,00:37:43.21,">> PROBST: Jaime, is there a chance Dave's trying to prove"
561,00:37:47.42,00:37:47.42,too much versus lead the tribe? >> I think Dave is definitely
562,00:37:53.21,00:37:53.21,over the top trying to prove himself.
563,00:37:55.62,00:37:55.62,"I mean, you wake up and there's already wood coming and it's"
564,00:37:58.08,00:37:58.08,"just, like, whoa, you know, slow down for a second."

566,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,>> I personally think most of us all get along.
567,00:38:07.17,00:38:07.17,"These two just clash heads, and I think sometimes the way you"
568,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,"phrase your demands, it might intimidate people."
569,00:38:14.62,00:38:14.62,>> I've also asked everyone here to check me if I have.

571,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,"check me because I need it. >> For me, I know we have work"
572,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,"to do, but I haven't enjoyed almost a single moment since"
573,00:38:27.71,00:38:27.71,I've been here. I barely know any of these
574,00:38:30.08,00:38:30.08,"people. I know Ashley, I know Jaime."
575,00:38:32.21,00:38:32.21,"I'm dying to know Erik a little better, but the other three, I"
576,00:38:34.33,00:38:34.33,couldn't even tell you their last names.
577,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,>> We're always working our butts off.
578,00:38:38.92,00:38:38.92,>> That's my... did you not hear what came out of my mouth?
579,00:38:41.25,00:38:41.25,Did you not hear what came out of my mouth?
580,00:38:45.04,00:38:45.04,"Never once have we sat down as a tribe to talk about, well"
581,00:38:47.83,00:38:47.83,what do we want to do as a tribe?
582,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,How are we going to make this come together?
583,00:38:51.71,00:38:51.71,"How are we going to win? Perfect example, again, Ashley,"
584,00:38:54.12,00:38:54.12,"every time she says something, you have a comment back."
585,00:38:57.38,00:38:57.38,>> And now look what happened. Now I'm on the chopping block.
586,00:39:02.33,00:39:02.33,">> PROBST: Ashley, what's the criteria for your vote tonight?"
587,00:39:05.12,00:39:05.12,>> I'm voting for Dave. >> I expect more than one vote
588,00:39:09.58,00:39:09.58,"tonight. >> PROBST: Dave, how would the"
589,00:39:12.08,00:39:12.08,tribe be better if it's Ashley that's voted out tonight?
590,00:39:14.92,00:39:14.92,>> There will be a heck of a lot less eggshells to walk
591,00:39:17.04,00:39:17.04,around on. I only have conflict with
592,00:39:20.21,00:39:20.21,"Ashley. >> PROBST: Well, once again"
593,00:39:23.96,00:39:23.96,we've had another good session of tribe therapy.
594,00:39:26.29,00:39:26.29,"It's time to vote. Erik, you're up."
595,00:39:46.17,00:39:46.17,">> In a different setting and circumstance, you might be"

600,00:40:33.04,00:40:33.04,decision is final. The person voted out will be
