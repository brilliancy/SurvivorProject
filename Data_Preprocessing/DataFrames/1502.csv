34,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,>> The fire pit has to be doneproperly the first time.
35,00:02:07.96,00:02:07.96,We can't have any more oopsieslike we did with the shelter.
36,00:02:12.25,00:02:12.25,"The shelter is one thing.Man, once you do a fire pit,"
37,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,we just got to do it once and do it right.
38,00:02:17.58,00:02:17.58,"Last night at tribal council,questions came up about"
39,00:02:19.96,00:02:19.96,"leadership.I raised my hand to say, ""Heck, "
40,00:02:22.21,00:02:22.21,"I'll do it.""I didn't want to be in a"
41,00:02:24.67,00:02:24.67,"leadership role, but instead ofresisting things like that,"
42,00:02:27.58,00:02:27.58,"especially with the people inmy tribe, I think it's"
43,00:02:30.46,00:02:30.46,actually better to embrace it.I think pull this dead pine tree
44,00:02:33.62,00:02:33.62,"out of the way, plopping thebricks down right here."
45,00:02:37.75,00:02:37.75,>> I just kind of don't want tosit next to the woods.
46,00:02:40.33,00:02:40.33,"We could put where our watercollection is, and we'll just"
47,00:02:43.29,00:02:43.29,move.>> Yeah.
48,00:02:45.12,00:02:45.12,I think that will be good.>> Uh-uh.
49,00:02:46.58,00:02:46.58,">> I mean, it will really helpwith the insects."
50,00:02:48.42,00:02:48.42,>> I want more shelter for thefire.
51,00:02:50.08,00:02:50.08,Putting it right there on theedge?
52,00:02:51.58,00:02:51.58,"No, I don't think that's agreat idea at all."
53,00:02:53.71,00:02:53.71,Okay.We're moving forward.
54,00:02:56.12,00:02:56.12,I don't want to startbelaboring this kind of stuff
55,00:02:59.88,00:02:59.88,because it sucks a lot of timeand energy away from getting
56,00:03:02.88,00:03:02.88,stuff done.>> Dave and I work pretty well
57,00:03:06.88,00:03:06.88,together.We both kind of do it in
58,00:03:09.04,00:03:09.04,"different ways, but ifanything, we're not being"
59,00:03:13.75,00:03:13.75,"competitive about, like, whocan be, like, leader."
60,00:03:16.96,00:03:16.96,>> I'm just trying to explainthe sensibility of why I think
61,00:03:19.04,00:03:19.04,it.If someone can think of
62,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17,"something different...>> No, no, you had valid"
63,00:03:22.83,00:03:22.83,reasons for putting it overthere.
64,00:03:24.33,00:03:24.33,"And you know what?For me, like, if you have"
65,00:03:26.17,00:03:26.17,"definite experience that it willwork better over there, I'll"
66,00:03:28.17,00:03:28.17,totally go with it.>> It seems that Dave is kind
67,00:03:30.50,00:03:30.50,"of the leader, the top guy, andPeih-gee is just below him."
68,00:03:35.21,00:03:35.21,She's kind of like the balanceof power.
69,00:03:37.79,00:03:37.79,>> I think we've got like agame plan...
70,00:03:39.58,00:03:39.58,>> We do.>> ...set in place.
71,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83,We can figure out who's goingto do what.
72,00:03:45.46,00:03:45.46,"But most important is knowingwhat the what is, you know."
73,00:03:49.00,00:03:49.00,">> Dave has a lot of goodideas, but if someone questions"
74,00:03:51.71,00:03:51.71,"it or if somebody comes up withtheir own idea, there is this"
75,00:03:55.17,00:03:55.17,sense that he's probably stillgoing to go with his idea.
76,00:03:59.21,00:03:59.21,>> If we could get our acttogether and do this fast this
77,00:04:01.58,00:04:01.58,morning and eat before ourpossible challenge this
78,00:04:04.83,00:04:04.83,"afternoon, we'd be rocking.>> You're wishing really hard,"
79,00:04:08.29,00:04:08.29,"Jaime, I'll tell you that rightnow."
80,00:04:10.29,00:04:10.29,You're wishing really hard.>> You should wish hard.
81,00:04:14.12,00:04:14.12,">> Okay, fine.>> It could get to the point"
82,00:04:17.50,00:04:17.50,where people start getting fedup and start talking about Dave
83,00:04:20.12,00:04:20.12,and how they don't necessarilythink he's a good leader
84,00:04:22.96,00:04:22.96,anymore.>> This is where it begins right

92,00:06:22.12,00:06:22.12,He gets up and instantly has tolay down because he's so tired.
93,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,">> Oh, man, I'm about to passout."
94,00:06:37.04,00:06:37.04,>> I will stick with youbecause you know this game.

97,00:06:44.58,00:06:44.58,Me and Todd made an alliancethat we're going to stick it out
98,00:06:47.00,00:06:47.00,"with each other until the end ofthis because even though Todd, I"
99,00:06:49.21,00:06:49.21,"think, is very devious, I'vebeen watching him really"
100,00:06:52.25,00:06:52.25,"closely and I think we have agood alliance so far, at"
101,00:06:54.92,00:06:54.92,"least until the merge.>> At some point, should we"
102,00:07:05.62,00:07:05.62,"pull him in as number three?>> Oh, yeah."
103,00:07:08.17,00:07:08.17,>> Because we need someonestrong to call our shots.
104,00:07:10.88,00:07:10.88,"We make the plans and he speaksthem out, which puts the target"
105,00:07:13.88,00:07:13.88,on him instead of us.>> We decided to pull Aaron
106,00:07:17.33,00:07:17.33,"into our group, so if anyonehas to take a rap for anything,"
107,00:07:20.46,00:07:20.46,"then it's going to be on Aaron.>> Obviously, this is about"
108,00:07:24.04,00:07:24.04,"power players, right, and whowants to go the furthest."
109,00:07:27.42,00:07:27.42,We need a three.>> Which is us.
110,00:07:29.96,00:07:29.96,>> Which is us.>> I think that would be smart.

113,00:07:40.79,00:07:40.79,>> Okay.>> Because that's how the game

117,00:07:49.46,00:07:49.46,">> I trust, too.>> Amanda and I have this game"
118,00:07:52.21,00:07:52.21,in our hands.So we have our alliance.
119,00:07:54.67,00:07:54.67,We have exactly what I wantedto come here to do.
120,00:07:57.83,00:07:57.83,">> You guys want to powwow?So, a lot harder than what we"
121,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,"thought, huh?Three sleepless nights, "
122,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,everyone's on edge.Everyone's angry.
123,00:08:06.29,00:08:06.29,We have to get into some sortof routine.
124,00:08:08.54,00:08:08.54,>> Why don't we just all rest?Now's a good time to get
125,00:08:12.71,00:08:12.71,"refreshed.>> Jean-Robert, you need to"
126,00:08:15.29,00:08:15.29,"start pulling your weight.This is what I feel, not"
127,00:08:18.62,00:08:18.62,whether I'm right or wrong.You might want to talk about it.
128,00:08:22.67,00:08:22.67,>> I know that I'm not workingas much as I'd like to be able
129,00:08:24.92,00:08:24.92,"to work, just because I'veslept a little bit less than"
130,00:08:27.42,00:08:27.42,"everybody, I think.>> Jean-Robert needs to step it"
131,00:08:30.29,00:08:30.29,up.What is up with this guy?
132,00:08:32.08,00:08:32.08,"He knows he's on the choppingblock, and it's pretty obvious"
133,00:08:34.58,00:08:34.58,"around camp.He's trying to divert it, but"
134,00:08:37.21,00:08:37.21,we're not buying it.>> The wheels are turning here.
135,00:08:40.17,00:08:40.17,"Believe me, I can contributeprobably as valuable of stuff"
136,00:08:44.00,00:08:44.00,"with my mind.But, I mean, as soon as we"
137,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,"start getting food and waterand everything, I think you're"
138,00:08:48.83,00:08:48.83,going to find I'm able tocontribute a lot more.
139,00:08:51.29,00:08:51.29,I'm considered one of the badboys of poker.
140,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,And I absolutely am using asimilar strategy in this
141,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,Survivor game.I wanted to give the perception
142,00:08:59.04,00:08:59.04,"I was a little bit lazy, solater when I am contributing"
143,00:09:02.17,00:09:02.17,"and putting in the work effort,people are noticing, ""Hey, this"
144,00:09:06.12,00:09:06.12,"guy is doing beyond his normalcapabilities."""
145,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00,"I know that I'd like to be ableto do a lot more than I am,"
146,00:09:12.04,00:09:12.04,"but, I mean, we've got a greatsquad."
147,00:09:19.96,00:09:19.96,"Even though it looks like I'min big trouble right now, it's"
148,00:09:22.33,00:09:22.33,kind of part of the plan.I can only go up from here.
149,00:09:41.96,00:09:41.96,>> Our biggest priority rightnow are mud bricks.
150,00:09:47.33,00:09:47.33,I have specific goals.We still have some shelter
151,00:09:50.50,00:09:50.50,"stuff to fix, but we haveenough shelter."
152,00:09:52.92,00:09:52.92,I think that's all right.The priority now we have flint
153,00:09:56.08,00:09:56.08,is to get a fireplace going.It's a very realistic and
154,00:10:01.96,00:10:01.96,achievable goal today.I want to keep goals achievable.
155,00:10:05.88,00:10:05.88,>> We need seven more.Do you think there's any
156,00:10:17.17,00:10:17.17,possible way to at least starta baby fire?
157,00:10:21.42,00:10:21.42,"If we could get a spark startedup, we could put it under"
158,00:10:25.21,00:10:25.21,"something, just keep it alive.>> You know what?"
159,00:10:27.58,00:10:27.58,I would rather get some of itup and then get a fire started.
160,00:10:34.21,00:10:34.21,>> All I asked was to make alittle baby fire to make a
161,00:10:37.21,00:10:37.21,"handful of rice for everybody.Instead, we try to build an"
162,00:10:40.25,00:10:40.25,elaborate barbecue pit.I'm not too thrilled about it.
163,00:10:46.12,00:10:46.12,">> Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.I just totally hosed both of"
164,00:10:52.29,00:10:52.29,you.>> That's fine.
165,00:11:14.88,00:11:14.88,">> Ashley.>> Oh, my gosh, what happened?"
166,00:11:18.04,00:11:18.04,>> Dave drops the brick downand splashes her.
167,00:11:21.75,00:11:21.75,>> Obviously he did it onpurpose.
168,00:11:24.96,00:11:24.96,"I'd like to go steal the flint,go out there and make me a"
169,00:11:28.12,00:11:28.12,little fire and cook some rice.>> We got the flint last night
170,00:11:34.58,00:11:34.58,"at tribal council, and wehaven't even attempted to make a"
171,00:11:37.58,00:11:37.58,fire.And we're starving.
172,00:11:42.04,00:11:42.04,It just seems like we take thelongest route possible to make
173,00:11:45.50,00:11:45.50,something happen.I'm losing faith rapidly.
174,00:11:57.21,00:11:57.21,>> Nothing here has wastedenergy.
175,00:11:59.88,00:11:59.88,I moved half those stonesmyself just now.
176,00:12:04.00,00:12:04.00,>> Okay.>> So if you can imagine...
177,00:12:06.12,00:12:06.12,>> So why don't we start thefire...
178,00:12:07.83,00:12:07.83,>> Let me finish.>> ...in the fireplace.
179,00:12:09.83,00:12:09.83,>> Let me finish.Mud bricks yea high.
180,00:12:12.21,00:12:12.21,I'm not stacking mud bricksaround a burning fire.
181,00:12:14.29,00:12:14.29,">> Mud bricks or not, you canstill try and get the fire"
182,00:12:16.46,00:12:16.46,going before the rain startsfalling.
183,00:12:17.54,00:12:17.54,"The rain's going to fall.But you're the leader, and I'm"
184,00:12:19.67,00:12:19.67,going to let you do what youwant.
185,00:12:21.38,00:12:21.38,">> I want to have shelter so itstays lit, Ashley."
186,00:12:24.33,00:12:24.33,"How many fires have you built,sweetheart?"
187,00:12:26.46,00:12:26.46,>> I'm just saying.I'm tired.

378,00:24:55.33,00:24:55.33,>> Adios.>> I believe that Dave's going
379,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,to shoot himself in the foot.He's not a good leader because
380,00:25:01.08,00:25:01.08,he's the most irritating personon the planet.
381,00:25:03.08,00:25:03.08,"He's just so patronizing.>> The last few days, I have"
382,00:25:25.21,00:25:25.21,been really sick.I just feel dirty.
383,00:25:28.67,00:25:28.67,I feel miserable.It's just hard because I don't
384,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,have my Bible.I know if I could read it and
385,00:25:34.21,00:25:34.21,"just spend some time with God,it would be great."
386,00:25:37.21,00:25:37.21,"But I mean, he has me here fora reason, so I'm going to keep"
387,00:25:40.42,00:25:40.42,fighting.>> My strategy as far as the
388,00:25:45.79,00:25:45.79,clue goes is I'm going to giveit to whom I think is their
389,00:25:49.62,00:25:49.62,"weakest link, just so I keeptheir team weaker. "
390,00:26:09.25,00:26:09.25,>> Don't let anybody know youhave it.
391,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,>> Okay.>> I feel like the Lord really
392,00:26:13.25,00:26:13.25,gave me a gift with the clueto the hidden immunity idol.

394,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,number one.What is thought to be hidden

396,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,"yours must be keen.""Hmm."
397,00:26:32.58,00:26:32.58,I feel really confident that Ican find the hidden immunity

399,00:26:37.50,00:26:37.50,"obvious.And I think, you know, this is"
400,00:26:39.75,00:26:39.75,probably something you see everyday and would never consider
401,00:26:41.88,00:26:41.88,that it would be a hiddenimmunity idol. 
402,00:27:04.21,00:27:04.21,">> I'm looking everywhere forthe hidden immunity idol,"
403,00:27:06.62,00:27:06.62,looking for something that wouldbe obvious.

406,00:27:12.71,00:27:12.71,"like.Like, if it was a snake, it"
407,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,would have bit me by now.I think what I really want do
408,00:27:17.00,00:27:17.00,"with this information I have isuse it to gain's someone trust,"
409,00:27:20.29,00:27:20.29,"so it has to be someone who'switty, somebody who can think"
410,00:27:23.21,00:27:23.21,"and Todd's pretty witty.So, I want to team up with him."
411,00:27:33.25,00:27:33.25,>> It said that is was obvious.I told Todd the idol is here.
412,00:27:36.21,00:27:36.21,So we're going to team up anduse it together.
413,00:27:40.54,00:27:40.54,And I trust him.>> Okay.

418,00:27:54.21,00:27:54.21,I'll be the only one that knowsabout it.
419,00:27:56.79,00:27:56.79,"So my goal is to find thatthing as fast as I can, and if"

506,00:34:09.92,00:34:09.92,days haven't been about onechallenge.
507,00:34:12.92,00:34:12.92,It's been about day in and dayout in camp and how you
508,00:34:16.38,00:34:16.38,contribute and what yourattitude's like.
509,00:34:26.08,00:34:26.08,I'm fairly confident how thingsare going to go this evening.
510,00:34:29.25,00:34:29.25,"You know, you reap what you sew.Nothing's carved in stone yet,"
511,00:34:32.67,00:34:32.67,but I'm pretty confident I'mnot going home.
512,00:34:39.96,00:34:39.96,>> I know that Dave is votingfor me at tonight's tribal
513,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,"council.At this point, I see my options"
514,00:34:47.21,00:34:47.21,"are this: I can either confronteverybody, act like a crazy"

516,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,"idiot, or I could keep my headtogether, go to tribal council"
517,00:34:58.25,00:34:58.25,"and tell everyone, like, ""Look,Dave is a crazy person."""
518,00:35:04.21,00:35:04.21,">> I feel like if there's suchconflict with Dave and Ashley,"
519,00:35:08.46,00:35:08.46,"you know, if people aretargeting Ashley for that"
520,00:35:11.08,00:35:11.08,"reason, I guess it also makesDave a target."
521,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,"If you had to pick betweenthose two, you might think"
522,00:35:17.42,00:35:17.42,"Dave, but I still see him asstrong."
523,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,Remove one of them and theother one can stay around.
524,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,See what I'm saying?It's probably dead even
525,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,between Ashley and Dave.It puts me in a hard place
526,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,"because Ashley is my friend,but then Dave's such hard worker"
527,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,and he knows what he's doing outhere.
528,00:35:47.62,00:35:47.62,So I'm not really sure what'sgoing to happen tonight.
529,00:36:21.54,00:36:21.54,">> PROBST: So, last time wewere here, we did a little"
530,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,"tribe therapy, and it appearedthat you had at least one"
531,00:36:27.38,00:36:27.38,"leader, maybe two.Frosti, how is that leadership"
532,00:36:29.46,00:36:29.46,"working out?>> Well, Dave's really stepped"
533,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,up.He was already giving some
534,00:36:34.79,00:36:34.79,"leadership-type demands, andhe's really trying to do"
535,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,"everything.At times, I fear he may attempt"
536,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,too much.>> It's a hard habit to kick.
537,00:36:43.54,00:36:43.54,">> PROBST: Ashley, you wererolling your eyes."
538,00:36:46.25,00:36:46.25,">> Well, Dave and I kind ofbutt heads sort of."
539,00:36:49.33,00:36:49.33,Our personalities just don'tmesh well.
540,00:36:51.75,00:36:51.75,"But I respect him as a leader,and when I have questions, I'll"
541,00:36:54.50,00:36:54.50,"ask them, even if I'm notsupposed to."
542,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,">> PROBST: And Dave, that rubsyou the wrong way?"
543,00:37:00.12,00:37:00.12,>> It doesn't rub me the wrongway at all.
544,00:37:02.12,00:37:02.12,Everyone is totally welcome toask questions.
545,00:37:03.96,00:37:03.96,"If you're unclear on something,then please do ask."
546,00:37:06.62,00:37:06.62,Because all I want to do is getcamp life fully squared away.
547,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,">> I don't expect Dave to say,""Well, yeah, that's the way it's"
548,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,"been.""That's what he does-- he goes"
549,00:37:14.46,00:37:14.46,off on rants and patronizes andtalks down to you and treats
550,00:37:17.12,00:37:17.12,"you like a child.>> PROBST: Ashley, do you think"
551,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,"this is just about you, or doyou notice it with other people,"
552,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,as well?>> I notice that other people
553,00:37:25.29,00:37:25.29,"have a problem with it as well.Dave talks in circles a lot,"
554,00:37:29.00,00:37:29.00,and he always wants to be themartyr.
555,00:37:31.50,00:37:31.50,"The way he handles thatleadership, it's just, for me,"
556,00:37:35.25,00:37:35.25,it's intolerable.>> I'm incredibly rusty at
557,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"leadership, too.This is a brand new boat for"
558,00:37:39.96,00:37:39.96,me.It's been a long time.
559,00:37:43.21,00:37:43.21,">> PROBST: Jaime, is there achance Dave's trying to prove"
560,00:37:47.42,00:37:47.42,too much versus lead the tribe?>> I think Dave is definitely
