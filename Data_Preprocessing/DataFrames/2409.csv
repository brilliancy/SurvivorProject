305,00:09:55.87,00:09:55.87,I'M SALIVATING RIGHT NOW AS I'M
306,00:09:57.97,00:09:57.97,STANDING HERE BECAUSE I HAVEN'T

312,00:10:10.03,00:10:10.03,LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT SUCKER!
313,00:10:14.00,00:10:14.00,(WHISTLES)

315,00:10:17.00,00:10:17.00,RIGHT NOW?
316,00:10:17.83,00:10:17.83,WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?
317,00:10:18.87,00:10:18.87,"WELL, I WAS MAD YESTERDAY..."
318,00:10:20.80,00:10:20.80,I WASN'T REALLY MAD BUT I DIDN'T
319,00:10:23.50,00:10:23.50,REALLY WANT TO SEND MIKE HOME.
320,00:10:26.47,00:10:26.47,IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CHRISTIE
321,00:10:29.30,00:10:29.30,THAT OR ALICIA BEFORE HIM.
322,00:10:32.43,00:10:32.43,BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEND
323,00:10:34.10,00:10:34.10,"ANOTHER DUDE HOME AND THEN,"
324,00:10:35.67,00:10:35.67,"LIKE, OH, WELL, OUR ALLIANCE,"
325,00:10:37.40,00:10:37.40,OUR GIRLS FLIP ON US OR
326,00:10:39.90,00:10:39.90,SOMETHING.
327,00:10:40.13,00:10:40.13,WE'RE HESITANT.
328,00:10:40.90,00:10:40.90,ME AND KAT WERE TALKING AND I
329,00:10:43.27,00:10:43.27,WANTED TO MAKE SURE SHE'S ON THE
330,00:10:44.63,00:10:44.63,SAME PAGE WITH ME BECAUSE AT
331,00:10:45.80,00:10:45.80,THIS POINT IT'S HARD TO TRUST
332,00:10:47.57,00:10:47.57,ANYBODY.
333,00:10:48.00,00:10:48.00,AND IF SOMEBODY HAS NUMBERS ON
334,00:10:49.40,00:10:49.40,"YOU, IT'S DEFINITELY HARD TO"
335,00:10:50.67,00:10:50.67,TRUST THEM.
336,00:10:51.60,00:10:51.60,"YOU KNOW, ALICIA, CHRISTINA,"
337,00:10:54.73,00:10:54.73,TARZAN AND LEIF ALL HAVE TO GO
338,00:10:56.07,00:10:56.07,BEFORE WE DO.
339,00:10:56.77,00:10:56.77,I KNOW.
340,00:10:57.93,00:10:57.93,WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.
341,00:10:59.63,00:10:59.63,"I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT OUR ALLIANCE"
342,00:11:01.63,00:11:01.63,SAID THEY WAS GOING TO DO.
343,00:11:03.37,00:11:03.37,LET'S DO IT.
344,00:11:04.37,00:11:04.37,LET'S SEND MANONO HOME AND STICK
345,00:11:05.47,00:11:05.47,WITH THE PLAN.
346,00:11:06.17,00:11:06.17,WHICH IS THE PLAN.
347,00:11:07.10,00:11:07.10,"GUYS, FOOD'S READY."
348,00:11:09.27,00:11:09.27,I'M COMING!
349,00:11:11.83,00:11:11.83,I'M A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS THAT THE
350,00:11:13.27,00:11:13.27,GIRLS ARE PLAYING TRICKS WITH
351,00:11:14.90,00:11:14.90,US.
352,00:11:15.23,00:11:15.23,"WOW, THAT IS SO GOOD!"
353,00:11:16.63,00:11:16.63,THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
354,00:11:17.87,00:11:17.87,"OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THE"
355,00:11:19.63,00:11:19.63,CHICKEN.
356,00:11:20.03,00:11:20.03,THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO
357,00:11:21.27,00:11:21.27,BE BLIND SIDES COMING UP.
358,00:11:22.63,00:11:22.63,I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT ME.
359,00:11:43.70,00:11:43.70,DO YOU NOT?
360,00:11:45.20,00:11:45.20,MIKE WENT OUT AND THE GIRLS ARE
361,00:11:47.23,00:11:47.23,AHEAD.
362,00:11:47.63,00:11:47.63,"I FEEL BAD BECAUSE, LIKE, I"
363,00:11:49.27,00:11:49.27,THINK DEEP DOWN THEY KNOW THEY
364,00:11:50.67,00:11:50.67,MADE THE WRONG CHOICE ALREADY.
365,00:11:51.90,00:11:51.90,THEY HAVE TO BE REALLY WORRIED.
366,00:11:55.47,00:11:55.47,IT'S DEFINITELY A WIN-WIN TO
367,00:11:58.77,00:11:58.77,HAVE ANOTHER GUY GONE AND KNOW
368,00:11:59.90,00:11:59.90,THE WOMEN ARE IN THE MAJORITY
369,00:12:01.63,00:12:01.63,"AND, YOU KNOW, MIKE'S GONE."
370,00:12:03.07,00:12:03.07,SO MY HOPE ALL ALONG HAS BEEN
371,00:12:04.73,00:12:04.73,EVERYBODY WILL THINK I'M JUST
372,00:12:05.80,00:12:05.80,KIND OF CALM AND SOFT SPOKEN AND
373,00:12:07.50,00:12:07.50,MAYBE A LITTLE FORGETTABLE AND
374,00:12:08.93,00:12:08.93,NOT CALLING THE SHOTS BUT I DO
375,00:12:10.83,00:12:10.83,THINK AT THE END OF THE GAME IF
376,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,I CAN SIT THERE WITH THE THREE I
377,00:12:13.50,00:12:13.50,THINK THE PEOPLE ON THE JURY
378,00:12:14.67,00:12:14.67,WILL KNOW THAT I WAS MAKING MOST
379,00:12:15.80,00:12:15.80,OF THESE DECISIONS.
380,00:12:19.37,00:12:19.37,I JUST THINK IT'S SMARTEST
381,00:12:21.23,00:12:21.23,FOR US TO GET RID OF JAY AND
382,00:12:22.87,00:12:22.87,TROY AND THEN GET RID OF TARZAN
383,00:12:24.70,00:12:24.70,AND LEIF.
384,00:12:25.20,00:12:25.20,"OKAY, LET'S JUST SAY..."
385,00:12:26.67,00:12:26.67,BUT WE NEED THEM TO BELIEVE
386,00:12:27.93,00:12:27.93,WITH ALL OF THEIR HEART THAT
387,00:12:28.97,00:12:28.97,THEY ARE NOT GOING HOME BECAUSE
388,00:12:30.80,00:12:30.80,IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL START...
389,00:12:32.00,00:12:32.00,THEY WILL FIND THAT IDOL OR
390,00:12:33.80,00:12:33.80,THEY'LL PULL SOME CRAP AND SO WE
391,00:12:36.57,00:12:36.57,JUST...
392,00:12:36.70,00:12:36.70,I AGREE.
393,00:12:38.47,00:12:38.47,I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
394,00:12:39.83,00:12:39.83,TO KNOW ABOUT IT.
395,00:12:42.00,00:12:42.00,DO YOU FEEL FUNKY ABOUT THAT?
396,00:12:45.40,00:12:45.40,I GOT A LOT GOING THROUGH MY
397,00:12:48.70,00:12:48.70,HEAD.
398,00:12:49.13,00:12:49.13,THE GIRLS HAD A DISCUSSION ON
399,00:12:50.43,00:12:50.43,THE BOAT THIS MORNING AND SAID
400,00:12:52.37,00:12:52.37,WHOEVER DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY
401,00:12:54.23,00:12:54.23,EITHER TROY OR JAY EITHER ONE OF
402,00:12:56.43,00:12:56.43,THEM HAS TO GO HOME NEXT.
403,00:12:59.23,00:12:59.23,WHICH IS KILLING ME RIGHT NOW.
404,00:13:01.57,00:13:01.57,BECAUSE I'VE LOOKED TROY AND JAY
405,00:13:03.60,00:13:03.60,"IN THE EYES AND SAID ""YOU CAN"
406,00:13:07.53,00:13:07.53,"TRUST ME 100%."""
407,00:13:09.13,00:13:09.13,AND LOOKING THEM IN THE EYES AND
408,00:13:10.90,00:13:10.90,TELLING THEM THEY CAN TRUST ME
409,00:13:12.10,00:13:12.10,"AND THEN BETRAYING THEM, THAT'S"
410,00:13:13.97,00:13:13.97,JUST NOT... THAT'S NOT ME AT
411,00:13:17.40,00:13:17.40,ALL.
412,00:13:20.63,00:13:20.63,"I DON'T KNOW, I'VE GOT TO"
413,00:13:23.10,00:13:23.10,THINK.
414,00:13:23.50,00:13:23.50,JAY COULD WIN EVERY IMMUNITY
415,00:13:24.97,00:13:24.97,FROM HERE ON IN.
416,00:13:25.80,00:13:25.80,AND TROY HAS A GOOD SHOT AT
417,00:13:27.10,00:13:27.10,"DOING THAT, TOO."
418,00:13:27.93,00:13:27.93,SO THE MINUTE THEY DON'T WIN I
419,00:13:29.40,00:13:29.40,THINK THEY HAVE TO GO.
420,00:13:31.57,00:13:31.57,THIS IS LIKE THE PART OF THIS
421,00:13:33.10,00:13:33.10,GAME THAT SUCKS SO BAD.
422,00:13:34.57,00:13:34.57,IT SUCKS ASS.
423,00:13:36.13,00:13:36.13,THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU
424,00:13:37.27,00:13:37.27,NEED TO TAKE YOUR HEART OUT OF
425,00:13:38.60,00:13:38.60,THE GAME AND PUT YOUR BRAIN BACK
426,00:13:39.90,00:13:39.90,IN THE GAME.
427,00:13:42.60,00:13:42.60,SERIOUSLY.
428,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,"LIKE, CHELSEA GOT ALL"
429,00:13:44.80,00:13:44.80,SENSITIVE.
430,00:13:45.20,00:13:45.20,"YOU KNOW, THAT REALLY PISSED ME"
431,00:13:47.83,00:13:47.83,OFF.
432,00:13:48.33,00:13:48.33,NO ONE TOLD YOU TO MIX WITH THE

953,00:29:07.10,00:29:07.10,TROY DIDN'T GIVE UP FOR FOOD SO
954,00:29:09.30,00:29:09.30,I THINK RIGHT NOW HE'S THE
955,00:29:11.03,00:29:11.03,SMARTEST PERSON TO TAKE OUT.
956,00:29:17.07,00:29:17.07,I THINK WE POTENTIALLY HAVE
957,00:29:20.97,00:29:20.97,EIGHT VOTES FOR TROY SO WE'RE

965,00:29:35.60,00:29:35.60,I'D RATHER KNOW EVERYONE'S VOTING FOR TROY BUT THERE'S A
966,00:29:38.67,00:29:38.67,CHANCE TROY WILL THROW OUT AN IMMUNITY IDOL.

1117,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,SO HOPEFULLY WE HAVE ENOUGH
1118,00:33:27.60,00:33:27.60,PEOPLE ON BOARD THAT DO ENOUGH
1119,00:33:29.07,00:33:29.07,OF THE RIGHT THING THAT THE
1120,00:33:30.93,00:33:30.93,RIGHT PERSON WILL GO HOME
1121,00:33:32.27,00:33:32.27,TONIGHT.
1122,00:33:53.50,00:33:53.50,Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
1123,00:33:54.73,00:33:54.73,THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
1124,00:33:58.70,00:33:58.70,JONAS AND MICHAEL VOTED OUT AT
1125,00:34:00.57,00:34:00.57,THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
1126,00:34:09.20,00:34:09.20,"TROYZAN, IN THE LAST TWO TRIBAL"
1127,00:34:11.07,00:34:11.07,"COUNCILS, TWO GUYS HAVE GONE"
1128,00:34:12.60,00:34:12.60,"HOME, JONAS AND MICHAEL."
1129,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,IS THAT A SIGN THAT MAYBE THIS
1130,00:34:16.00,00:34:16.00,IS STILL A MEN VERSUS WOMEN
1131,00:34:18.10,00:34:18.10,GAME?
1132,00:34:18.50,00:34:18.50,I THOUGHT IT WAS COINCIDENCE
1133,00:34:19.90,00:34:19.90,"BUT AS DAYS GO ON, THE MORE I'M"
1134,00:34:22.20,00:34:22.20,THINKING IT'S STILL A LITTLE BIT
1135,00:34:25.50,00:34:25.50,MEN/WOMEN.
1136,00:34:25.77,00:34:25.77,"Jeff: TARZAN, HOW DID THE"
1137,00:34:27.50,00:34:27.50,"MEN LOSE CONTROL IF THIS IS,"

1139,00:34:31.87,00:34:31.87,"WELL, THEY LOST THEIR WILL"
1140,00:34:33.57,00:34:33.57,SEVERAL DAYS AND THE ALLEGIANCE
1141,00:34:37.27,00:34:37.27,WAS BROKEN AND NOW IT'S WOMEN
1142,00:34:39.50,00:34:39.50,TWO-UP.
1143,00:34:39.90,00:34:39.90,SO THE GIRLS ARE A LOT SMARTER
1144,00:34:41.10,00:34:41.10,THAN THE BOYS.
1145,00:34:43.23,00:34:43.23,"Jeff: JAY, IS IT POSSIBLE"
1146,00:34:44.63,00:34:44.63,THAT IT'S JUST THE WAY THE
1147,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,NUMBERS FELL THAT IT'S TWO GUYS?
1148,00:34:47.70,00:34:47.70,I'M KIND OF WITH TROY ON

1150,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,MY HOPE OF GUYS AND GIRLS
1151,00:34:52.23,00:34:52.23,MESHING AND JOINING A LITTLE
1152,00:34:53.50,00:34:53.50,"BIT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF"
1153,00:34:55.50,00:34:55.50,SCRAMBLING GOING ON TODAY AND I
1154,00:34:57.20,00:34:57.20,DON'T FEEL AS SAFE AS I DID LAST
1155,00:34:58.83,00:34:58.83,TIME SITTING HERE TONIGHT.
1156,00:35:00.77,00:35:00.77,"Jeff: ACTUALLY, LET ME ASK"
1157,00:35:02.43,00:35:02.43,EVERYONE ELSE HERE.
1158,00:35:03.10,00:35:03.10,WHO HERE TONIGHT THINKS THEY
1159,00:35:04.30,00:35:04.30,MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE?
1160,00:35:07.80,00:35:07.80,"KIM, JAY, TROYZAN."
1161,00:35:09.93,00:35:09.93,NOBODY ELSE?
1162,00:35:12.40,00:35:12.40,"KIM, DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU,"
1163,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,WITH ALL THE SCRAMBLING JAY
1164,00:35:15.07,00:35:15.07,TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE'S STILL
1165,00:35:16.30,00:35:16.30,ONLY THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE
1166,00:35:17.63,00:35:17.63,WORRIED?
1167,00:35:17.90,00:35:17.90,"YEAH, I DON'T KNOW."
1168,00:35:19.00,00:35:19.00,I FELT SAFE AT THE IMMUNITY
1169,00:35:20.70,00:35:20.70,"CHALLENGE, I FELT SAFE WHILE I"
1170,00:35:22.17,00:35:22.17,ATE AND AFTERWARDS JUST TODAY
1171,00:35:24.23,00:35:24.23,THIS AFTERNOON AT CAMP THERE WAS
1172,00:35:26.57,00:35:26.57,A FUNKY VIBE.
1173,00:35:27.80,00:35:27.80,I THINK YOU UNDERESTIMATE HOW
1174,00:35:30.13,00:35:30.13,"PARANOID PEOPLE GET, THEY RUN"
1175,00:35:31.23,00:35:31.23,AROUND AND OTHER PEOPLE GET
1176,00:35:32.73,00:35:32.73,PARANOID.
1177,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,SO I STARTED FEELING A LOT LESS
1178,00:35:34.63,00:35:34.63,SAFE AFTER THE IMMUNITY
1179,00:35:36.13,00:35:36.13,CHALLENGE TODAY.
1180,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,"Jeff: CHELSEA, PARANOIA."
1181,00:35:40.03,00:35:40.03,PARANOIA CAN REALLY WREAK HAVOC
1182,00:35:42.33,00:35:42.33,ON A PLAN.
1183,00:35:43.77,00:35:43.77,WHAT DO YOU DO IN THIS GAME TO
1184,00:35:46.03,00:35:46.03,KEEP YOUR PLAN INTACT?
1185,00:35:47.90,00:35:47.90,"YOU KNOW, THERE'S A... AS"
1186,00:35:51.40,00:35:51.40,"MUCH AS THIS GAME... YOU KNOW,"
1187,00:35:53.83,00:35:53.83,WE'VE ALL WATCHED IT AND WE KNOW
1188,00:35:55.40,00:35:55.40,THAT PEOPLE ARE DISHONEST BUT
1189,00:35:56.73,00:35:56.73,THERE COMES A POINT WHERE YOU
1190,00:35:58.10,00:35:58.10,REALLY HAVE TO GO WITH YOUR GUT
1191,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,AND JUST REALLY HOPE THAT PEOPLE
1192,00:36:02.00,00:36:02.00,ARE BEING HONEST WITH YOU AND
1193,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00,JUST LOOK THEM IN THE EYES AND
1194,00:36:05.37,00:36:05.37,JUST TELL THEM HOW YOU FEEL AND
1195,00:36:06.90,00:36:06.90,HOPE THAT THEY'RE BEING HONEST
1196,00:36:08.27,00:36:08.27,WHEN THEY RESPOND.
1197,00:36:11.03,00:36:11.03,AND THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.
1198,00:36:12.83,00:36:12.83,"Jeff: TROYZAN, HOW MIXED UP"
1199,00:36:14.87,00:36:14.87,IS THIS GAME RIGHT NOW?
1200,00:36:16.23,00:36:16.23,IN MY MIND IT'S MIXED UP LIKE
1201,00:36:18.87,00:36:18.87,HELL.
1202,00:36:19.23,00:36:19.23,Jeff: DID IT MIX UP BEFORE
1203,00:36:20.93,00:36:20.93,THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE OR AFTER?
1204,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,AFTER.
1205,00:36:24.03,00:36:24.03,"YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN"
1206,00:36:25.23,00:36:25.23,KIND OF START TO TELL LIKE WHO
1207,00:36:28.03,00:36:28.03,DECIDES TO STEP OUT FIRST AND
1208,00:36:29.73,00:36:29.73,"GET FOOD, WHO APPLAUDS WHO WHEN"
1209,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,SOMEONE GOES OUT.
1210,00:36:33.13,00:36:33.13,"YOU KNOW, I NOTICED THAT WHEN I"
1211,00:36:34.97,00:36:34.97,WENT OUT EVERYBODY APPLAUDED
1212,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,EVEN SOME OF THE TRIBE THAT I
1213,00:36:38.63,00:36:38.63,THOUGHT WOULD BE ROOTING FOR ME
1214,00:36:40.17,00:36:40.17,I THINK MIGHT BE ROOTING AGAINST
1215,00:36:42.10,00:36:42.10,ME.
1216,00:36:42.43,00:36:42.43,SO THAT MEANT SOMETHING.
1217,00:36:45.23,00:36:45.23,"Jeff: CHELSEA, WHAT'S THE"
1218,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,TALK ABOUT HIDDEN IMMUNITY
1219,00:36:49.23,00:36:49.23,IDOLS.
1220,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,THE TALK IS THAT WE'RE AT DAY
1221,00:36:51.27,00:36:51.27,25 AND NO ONE'S YET TO PULL ONE
1222,00:36:53.87,00:36:53.87,OUT.
1223,00:36:54.23,00:36:54.23,Jeff: IS THERE TALK ABOUT
1224,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,WHO MIGHT HAVE ONE?
1225,00:36:55.73,00:36:55.73,YEAH.
1226,00:36:57.13,00:36:57.13,THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ACT
1227,00:36:58.83,00:36:58.83,SUSPICIOUS WITH THEIR BAGS OR
1228,00:37:00.90,00:37:00.90,THEIR POCKETS LOOK A LITTLE MORE
1229,00:37:03.20,00:37:03.20,"FULL OR, YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE"

1248,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR SWIMMING
1249,00:37:33.23,00:37:33.23,TRUNKS AND HE'S GOT A LOT OF
1250,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,POCKETS THERE.

1261,00:37:52.30,00:37:52.30,AND THE FAITH WILL BE RESTORED
1262,00:37:53.40,00:37:53.40,AND THERE WILL BE A POWERHOUSE
1263,00:37:54.67,00:37:54.67,THAT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE END.
