333,00:14:23.67,00:14:23.67,>> WE'LL DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING.
334,00:14:25.17,00:14:25.17,"DON'T CHANGE NOTHING, PRETTY MUCH."
335,00:14:27.25,00:14:27.25,>> DON'T THINK YOU A G.--
336,00:14:28.62,00:14:28.62,WHICH IS A GANGSTER-- BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

375,00:15:43.29,00:15:43.29,AND IT CAME OUT IN THE VOTE LAST NIGHT.

420,00:17:39.17,00:17:39.17,BECAUSE MARTY AND JILL HAVE BEEN TIGHT AS TICKS.

442,00:18:24.29,00:18:24.29,I GOT CONTROL OF THAT ENTIRE TRIBE
443,00:18:26.75,00:18:26.75,AND NOT NECESSARILY BY BEING A LEADER BUT BY BEING A PLAYER.
444,00:18:29.42,00:18:29.42,"FABIO JUST TOLD ME THAT SOMEBODY JUST PUSHED SOMEBODY ASIDE,"

464,00:19:08.21,00:19:08.21,SO WHY NOT PLAY IT UP FRONT
465,00:19:10.96,00:19:10.96,AND TRY TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT.
466,00:19:12.62,00:19:12.62,"WE SHARED THE CLUE, EVERYBODY READ IT."
467,00:19:14.54,00:19:14.54,THAT'S WHY I'M SURPRISED YOU GUYS...

488,00:20:06.42,00:20:06.42,CAN'T EVEN GET THE HEAT FROM THE FIRE WITH THESE WINDS.
489,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,>> WE NEED TO GET SOME WOOD IN THERE NOW.

493,00:20:18.33,00:20:18.33,WE'RE GETTING A CRAZY WIND.
494,00:20:20.25,00:20:20.25,THEY'VE GOT A HIGH ROOF
495,00:20:21.67,00:20:21.67,AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF RAIN HERE TODAY.

497,00:20:26.21,00:20:26.21,IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE'S ANY SIGN OF STOPPING.
498,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,>> RAIN'S GONNA STOP.
499,00:20:35.58,00:20:35.58,IT'S GOT TO STOP EVENTUALLY.
500,00:20:41.38,00:20:41.38,">> HANG IN THERE, BABY, IT'S GOING TO BLOW OVER."
501,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,>> THIS RAIN OUT HERE IS HIDEOUS.

504,00:20:50.96,00:20:50.96,BECAUSE WHEN I'M COLD
505,00:20:52.12,00:20:52.12,AND I'M NOT REALLY DOING TOO WELL I LOSE IT.
506,00:21:03.62,00:21:03.62,THIS WEATHER IS THE WORST.

514,00:21:35.00,00:21:35.00,AND SHE JUST SEEMS LIKE SHE'S ON HER PERIOD ALL THE TIME.
515,00:21:38.92,00:21:38.92,RAIN IS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL HERE.
516,00:21:40.83,00:21:40.83,WE'RE ON A BEACH.

527,00:22:02.92,00:22:02.92,AND IT WAS JUST STRIPPED FROM US.
528,00:22:06.42,00:22:06.42,>> BECAUSE IT'S WET AND I HAVE NO CLOTHES.
529,00:22:09.08,00:22:09.08,>> YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE TO BE WARM AND COMFORTABLE.

742,00:31:09.46,00:31:09.46,TO EAT THE CHICKEN EXCEPT FOR TYRONE.
743,00:31:12.08,00:31:12.08,"YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO GO AGAINST TYRONE."
744,00:31:15.04,00:31:15.04,"TYRONE IS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING,"
745,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,BUT I THINK WE NEED TO START STANDING UP TO TYRONE.

753,00:31:38.96,00:31:38.96,BUT WE'RE GOING TO KILL ONE FOR IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION
754,00:31:41.04,00:31:41.04,AND AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HUNGRY AGAIN.
755,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,BUT I'M NOT GOING AGAINST IT
756,00:31:45.83,00:31:45.83,"AND JUST SAY ""NO, THAT AIN'T HAPPENING."""
757,00:31:47.88,00:31:47.88,IT WOULDN'T BE SMART TO ROCK THE BOAT RIGHT NOW.
758,00:32:03.46,00:32:03.46,>> WHOO!
759,00:32:04.75,00:32:04.75,>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
760,00:32:13.33,00:32:13.33,>> I NOTICED AS WE WERE CLEANING THE CHICKEN
761,00:32:15.50,00:32:15.50,"AND AS WE WERE BOILING THE CHICKEN,"
762,00:32:17.29,00:32:17.29,"TYRONE, HE STAYED IN THE BACKGROUND"
763,00:32:19.62,00:32:19.62,"BECAUSE IT WASN'T HIS WAY,"
764,00:32:21.08,00:32:21.08,INSTEAD OF PITCHING IN.
765,00:32:22.38,00:32:22.38,"BUT AS SOON AS IT WAS TIME TO EAT THE CHICKEN,"
766,00:32:24.33,00:32:24.33,HE WAS RIGHT THERE.
767,00:32:26.96,00:32:26.96,"OH, DOES THAT LOOK GOOD."
768,00:32:29.38,00:32:29.38,>> THAT LOOKS PRETTY DELICIOUS.
769,00:32:32.21,00:32:32.21,>> JUST HAVE EVERYBODY TAKE SOME.
770,00:32:33.54,00:32:33.54,WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?
771,00:32:52.12,00:32:52.12,>> WE HAD PLENTY OF FOOD FOR EVERYBODY
772,00:32:54.83,00:32:54.83,AND EVERYBODY TOOK A MEDIOCRE REGULAR SIZE PORTION.
773,00:32:58.12,00:32:58.12,MEANWHILE YOU HAVE TYRONE IN THE CORNER
774,00:33:00.29,00:33:00.29,JUST FEASTING AND IT WAS VERY BLATANTLY OBVIOUS
775,00:33:03.62,00:33:03.62,THAT HE HAD GOTTEN MORE CHICKEN
776,00:33:05.79,00:33:05.79,THAN THE REST OF THE TRIBE
777,00:33:08.08,00:33:08.08,SO HE'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE OBNOXIOUS BY THE DAY.
778,00:33:19.17,00:33:19.17,>> BUT LOOK OUT FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR.
779,00:33:20.92,00:33:20.92,LOOK OUT FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR.
780,00:33:23.38,00:33:23.38,">> TYRONE'S, YOU KNOW,"
781,00:33:25.79,00:33:25.79,"GRANTED, HE'S A VERY PHYSICAL PLAYER"
782,00:33:27.58,00:33:27.58,AND HE COULD BENEFIT US IN SOME CHALLENGES
783,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,"IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,"
784,00:33:31.67,00:33:31.67,BUT HE'S NOT THE EASIEST GUY
785,00:33:33.88,00:33:33.88,TO BE ON THE SAME TRIBE WITH
786,00:33:35.08,00:33:35.08,SO I THINK THAT CUTTING HIM LOOSE TONIGHT
787,00:33:37.67,00:33:37.67,"WOULD ABSOLUTELY BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER,"
788,00:33:40.25,00:33:40.25,BUT IT WORRIES ME A BIT.
789,00:33:42.54,00:33:42.54,NAONKA IS HANGING ON BY A THREAD.
790,00:33:45.88,00:33:45.88,SHE'S STRUGGLING.
791,00:33:47.62,00:33:47.62,"SHE ALMOST THREW THE RED FLAG LAST NIGHT,"
792,00:33:49.54,00:33:49.54,AND SHE'S NOT DOING TOO WELL.
793,00:33:51.71,00:33:51.71,I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S ALL THERE MENTALLY RIGHT NOW.
794,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,>> WHAT'S THE SENTIMENT ON YOUR SIDE?
795,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,>> NAY'S NOT IN THIS MENTALLY.
796,00:33:59.21,00:33:59.21,>> FOR SOMEONE WHO OBVIOUSLY KNOWS
797,00:34:02.08,00:34:02.08,"THAT SHE'S, LIKE, ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,"
798,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,SHE'S NOT REALLY POLITICKING A LOT.
799,00:34:06.29,00:34:06.29,"SO SHE MIGHT BE KIND OF, LIKE, LOOKING FORWARD TO IT."
800,00:34:09.38,00:34:09.38,AS OF NOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE KIND OF THINKING
801,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG.
802,00:34:12.83,00:34:12.83,>> I WANT TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG.
803,00:34:14.25,00:34:14.25,>> EVERYONE AT CAMP IS AWARE

805,00:34:18.71,00:34:18.71,IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BIG DEAL.
806,00:34:20.54,00:34:20.54,WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEND NAY HOME.
807,00:34:22.29,00:34:22.29,WE SHOULD BE HAPPY WE HAVE HOLLY.
808,00:34:23.75,00:34:23.75,"MYSELF, CHASE, BENRY AND HOLLY,"
809,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,WE'RE DEFINITELY IN CONTROL OF THIS GAME
810,00:34:30.46,00:34:30.46,"SO WE HAVE TO DO DECIDE WHO GOES HOME,"
811,00:34:32.67,00:34:32.67,TYRONE OR NAONKA.
812,00:34:34.88,00:34:34.88,"I MEAN, I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO SEE"
813,00:34:36.96,00:34:36.96,WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO.
814,00:34:56.25,00:34:56.25,>> Jeff: ALINA.
815,00:34:57.83,00:34:57.83,BEEN TOGETHER WITH THIS NEW TRIBE THREE DAYS.
816,00:35:00.42,00:35:00.42,TELL ME ABOUT THE DYNAMICS.
817,00:35:01.75,00:35:01.75,HOW'S EVERYBODY GETTING ALONG?
818,00:35:03.04,00:35:03.04,">> UM, COMING TOGETHER,"
819,00:35:04.75,00:35:04.75,"IT WAS NICE AT THE BEGINNING, OBVIOUSLY."
820,00:35:06.79,00:35:06.79,BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
821,00:35:08.88,00:35:08.88,"THE OLD LA FLOR TRIBE,"
822,00:35:10.29,00:35:10.29,"WE LIVED THE WAY WE LIVED,"
823,00:35:11.54,00:35:11.54,"WE HAD THE WAY WE DID THINGS,"
824,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF TURF WARS.
825,00:35:15.33,00:35:15.33,"NOW THAT WE'RE ON ESPADA'S TURF,"
826,00:35:17.88,00:35:17.88,WE KIND OF HAVE TO GO WITH THEIR RULES.
827,00:35:20.00,00:35:20.00,">> Jeff: BENRY, TELL ME ABOUT LEADERSHIP."
828,00:35:21.75,00:35:21.75,"YOU'VE GOT FOUR PEOPLE FROM THE YOUNG TRIBE,"
829,00:35:23.79,00:35:23.79,FOUR PEOPLE FROM THE OLDER TRIBE.
830,00:35:25.25,00:35:25.25,>> YEAH.
831,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,TYRONE SEEMS TO BE THE BOSS MAN AROUND ESPADA.
832,00:35:29.88,00:35:29.88,"HE'S GOT AN ASSERTIVE PERSONALITY,"
833,00:35:31.42,00:35:31.42,"A LOUD VOICE, AND WHAT HE SAYS USUALLY GOES."
834,00:35:34.21,00:35:34.21,>> Jeff: TYRONE?
835,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,>> SIR?
836,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,>> Jeff: WHAT COMES WITH BEING THE LEADER OF THIS TRIBE?
837,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17,>> IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY
838,00:35:40.83,00:35:40.83,"BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK TO YOU FOR ANSWERS,"
839,00:35:42.71,00:35:42.71,INSIGHT AND WISDOM SO TO SPEAK.
840,00:35:44.54,00:35:44.54,>> Jeff: DO YOU FEEL QUALIFIED?
841,00:35:45.96,00:35:45.96,">> YEAH, I DEFINITELY FEEL QUALIFIED"
842,00:35:48.25,00:35:48.25,TO BE A LEADER OF THIS TRIBE.
843,00:35:50.17,00:35:50.17,>> Jeff: ARE YOU HAPPY BEING THE LEADER?
844,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,">> YEAH, I EMBRACE THE POSITION."
845,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,"BASICALLY WHEN I LEAD, I TAKE INPUT FROM OTHERS."
846,00:35:56.83,00:35:56.83,"I DON'T MAKE UNILATERAL DECISIONS,"
847,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT ALINA SAID THERE WERE TURF WARS.
848,00:36:02.71,00:36:02.71,MAYBE WE CAN ADDRESS THEM
849,00:36:04.12,00:36:04.12,BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BE AS SMOOTH AS IT CAN BE
850,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED.
851,00:36:08.71,00:36:08.71,">> Jeff: WELL, NOW'S A GOOD TIME TO ADDRESS THEM."
852,00:36:10.54,00:36:10.54,"ALINA, YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH TYRONE"
853,00:36:12.54,00:36:12.54,WHAT TURF WARS YOU'RE REFERRING TO?
854,00:36:14.29,00:36:14.29,">> JUST WHEN WE CAME INTO CAMP, IT WAS REALLY LIKE A SPEECH."
855,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,LIKE THIS IS HOW THIS GOES.
856,00:36:19.79,00:36:19.79,"WE'VE BEEN SURVIVING, TOO."
857,00:36:21.79,00:36:21.79,>> Jeff: SO YOU FELT A LITTLE LIKE A CHILD?
858,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,>> A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CHILD.
859,00:36:25.29,00:36:25.29,">> JEFF, I JUST WANT TO INTERJECT,"
860,00:36:27.21,00:36:27.21,"I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY DID IT AT LA FLOR,"
861,00:36:29.58,00:36:29.58,BUT ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS INTRODUCE THEM.
862,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
863,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,IF I WAS LAYING DOWN THE LAW.
864,00:36:34.58,00:36:34.58,"SO THAT WASN'T MY INTENT,"
865,00:36:36.25,00:36:36.25,IF IT WAS RECEIVED THAT WAY.
866,00:36:37.92,00:36:37.92,"I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE GENERATION GAP, YOU KNOW."
867,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,SO I DON'T KNOW.
868,00:36:41.42,00:36:41.42,">> Jeff: ALINA, WHAT'S BEEN THE TOUGHEST DAY OUT HERE SO FAR?"
869,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,>> I THINK IT'S THE NIGHTS THAT ARE TOUGH.
870,00:36:47.54,00:36:47.54,ESPECIALLY LAST TWO NIGHTS.
871,00:36:49.38,00:36:49.38,THEY WERE REALLY RAINY.
872,00:36:50.62,00:36:50.62,EVERYBODY WAS DRENCHED AND IT WAS COLD.
873,00:36:52.54,00:36:52.54,I THINK THAT'S THE TOUGHEST PART TO GET THROUGH.
874,00:36:54.75,00:36:54.75,">> Jeff: NAONKA, WHAT HAS BEEN THE DARKEST STORM FOR YOU?"
875,00:36:58.17,00:36:58.17,">> OH, MY GOSH."
876,00:36:59.33,00:36:59.33,ULTIMATELY IT WAS LAST NIGHT.
877,00:37:01.50,00:37:01.50,I WAS FREEZING.
878,00:37:02.96,00:37:02.96,I WAS SHAKING.
879,00:37:04.42,00:37:04.42,I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GONNA BE THIS DIFFICULT FOR ME.
880,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,>> Jeff: COMPARE IT.
881,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,WHAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING
882,00:37:09.71,00:37:09.71,YOU'VE DONE IN LIFE UP UNTIL NOW?
883,00:37:11.08,00:37:11.08,">> GETTING A DIVORCE AT 26, 27."
884,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,THAT'S BEEN THE HARDEST THING FOR ME.
885,00:37:15.79,00:37:15.79,>> Jeff: AND WHAT WAS DIFFICULT ABOUT THAT?
886,00:37:19.25,00:37:19.25,">> BLAMING MYSELF,"
887,00:37:21.21,00:37:21.21,THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE ONE THAT MESSED IT UP.
888,00:37:23.71,00:37:23.71,AND THAT WAS TOUGH.
889,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,AND I COULDN'T SHIELD MYSELF FROM THAT PARTICULAR STORM.
890,00:37:28.96,00:37:28.96,HERE I HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM
891,00:37:30.79,00:37:30.79,AND I HAVE A SAFETY NET.
892,00:37:32.08,00:37:32.08,AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT
893,00:37:33.58,00:37:33.58,WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THE DIVORCE.
894,00:37:35.79,00:37:35.79,>> Jeff: THAT'S GOT TO BLOW YOUR MIND A BIT.
895,00:37:37.62,00:37:37.62,THESE ARE STRANGERS COMPETING AGAINST YOU
896,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,FOR A MILLION DOLLARS
897,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,AND YOU RECEIVE MORE LOVE FROM THEM
898,00:37:44.54,00:37:44.54,THAN YOU DID IN YOUR MOST PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.
899,00:37:47.12,00:37:47.12,>> I SURE DID.
900,00:37:48.12,00:37:48.12,AND IT WAS TOUGH FOR ME TO OPEN UP AND TELL THEM
901,00:37:49.92,00:37:49.92,BUT THEY HAD A LOT OF ENCOURAGING WORDS.
902,00:37:51.58,00:37:51.58,>> Jeff: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS WAS A MONUMENTAL NIGHT.
903,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,YOU'RE COMPARING IT TO THE WORST TIME IN YOUR LIFE.
904,00:37:58.75,00:37:58.75,>> I ALMOST WAS READY TO GIVE UP.
905,00:38:00.67,00:38:00.67,>> Jeff: MEANING YOU WERE WANTING TO QUIT?
906,00:38:02.12,00:38:02.12,>> I WANTED TO QUIT.
907,00:38:03.62,00:38:03.62,I WANTED TO QUIT BECAUSE IT GOT THAT TOUGH.
908,00:38:05.58,00:38:05.58,"IT WAS NOT 24 HOURS IN THAT DAY,"
909,00:38:07.12,00:38:07.12,IT WAS 26 BUT IT FELT LIKE 48.
910,00:38:09.21,00:38:09.21,I WAS AT MY BREAKING POINT YESTERDAY.
911,00:38:12.12,00:38:12.12,">> Jeff: BENRY, WHEN YOU SEE NAONKA CLEARLY STRUGGLING,"
912,00:38:17.54,00:38:17.54,THERE HAS TO BE A NURTURING PART OF YOU
913,00:38:19.92,00:38:19.92,WANTING TO COMFORT HER.
914,00:38:21.08,00:38:21.08,"AS A COMPETITOR, SEE YA."
915,00:38:23.29,00:38:23.29,">> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, EXACTLY?"
916,00:38:26.62,00:38:26.62,>> Jeff: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU DON'T KNOW.
917,00:38:28.58,00:38:28.58,WE'RE HERE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
918,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,NOBODY WANTS TO BE VOTED.
919,00:38:31.88,00:38:31.88,"THERE'S A WOMAN SAYING ""I'LL GO."
920,00:38:33.38,00:38:33.38,"NO CHANCE MY NAME GETS WRITTEN DOWN TONIGHT."""
921,00:38:35.42,00:38:35.42,"YVE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?"
922,00:38:37.46,00:38:37.46,>> I THINK I DO.
923,00:38:38.71,00:38:38.71,>> Jeff: YOU THINK YOU DO?
924,00:38:40.00,00:38:40.00,">> WELL, ALL RIGHT, I DO."
925,00:38:41.25,00:38:41.25,"WHEN I SEE NAY START BREAKING DOWN MENTALLY,"
926,00:38:44.38,00:38:44.38,IN MY HEAD I DON'T SEE LONGEVITY THERE
927,00:38:46.79,00:38:46.79,"AND I START QUESTIONING IT, I DO."
928,00:38:48.29,00:38:48.29,WHY ARE YOU HERE IF YOU'RE STARTING TO BREAK DOWN?
929,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,AM I GOING TO ALIGN WITH YOU
930,00:38:52.29,00:38:52.29,AND A WEEK OR TWO I JUST SEE IT AGAIN?
931,00:38:54.58,00:38:54.58,"I WANT LONGEVITY WITH THESE PEOPLE,"
932,00:38:56.25,00:38:56.25,AND IT DID MAKE ME QUESTION.
933,00:38:57.62,00:38:57.62,">> Jeff: NAONKA, WHILE YOU WERE BREAKING DOWN,"
934,00:39:00.96,00:39:00.96,"WERE YOU CONSCIOUS ENOUGH OF THE GAME AROUND YOU TO THINK,"
935,00:39:04.08,00:39:04.08,"MAN, THIS IS NOT GOOD RIGHT NOW?"
936,00:39:06.12,00:39:06.12,">> WELL, EVERYTHING GETS TRICKY AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."
937,00:39:09.08,00:39:09.08,MAYBE THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE ZIPPING THEIR LIP.
938,00:39:11.58,00:39:11.58,"MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST KEEPING IT 100,"
939,00:39:13.54,00:39:13.54,WHICH IS KEEPING IT REAL.
940,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
941,00:39:16.17,00:39:16.17,THERE'S A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE ON THIS TEAM
942,00:39:18.08,00:39:18.08,SO THEY KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP AND WHEN TO TALK.
943,00:39:22.04,00:39:22.04,">> Jeff: WELL, SOMEBODY'S QUEST TO OUTLAST ALL THE REST"
944,00:39:26.17,00:39:26.17,IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END.
945,00:39:27.67,00:39:27.67,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
946,00:39:29.04,00:39:29.04,"ALINA, YOU'RE UP."
947,00:39:41.04,00:39:41.04,">> THIS IS A GROWN FOLKS GAME AND AS YOU SAY,"
948,00:39:44.12,00:39:44.12,YOU'RE KEEPING IT 100.
949,00:39:45.33,00:39:45.33,I'M GOING TO KEEP IT 100.
950,00:39:46.79,00:39:46.79,PEACE OUT.
951,00:40:00.79,00:40:00.79,>> IT'S TIME TO DETHRONE THE KING OF ESPADA.
952,00:40:04.21,00:40:04.21,"BENRY'S HERE, BABY."
953,00:40:07.21,00:40:07.21,MY BAD.
954,00:40:23.12,00:40:23.12,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
955,00:40:33.25,00:40:33.25,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
956,00:40:34.92,00:40:34.92,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL ASKED TO LEAVE

992,00:42:40.50,00:42:40.50,WAS INITIALLY TO STAY AS STRONG AS WE COULD.
993,00:42:42.83,00:42:42.83,"WE OPERATED ON A DEMOCRATIC BASIS, BASICALLY,"
994,00:42:45.12,00:42:45.12,WHERE EVERYBODY HAD SOME INPUT
995,00:42:46.67,00:42:46.67,"AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN LA FLOR CAME OVER,"
996,00:42:49.17,00:42:49.17,THINGS TURNED AWAY FROM THE TRIBE ASPECT
997,00:42:51.21,00:42:51.21,AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THEIR STRATEGY FROM THE JUMP.
998,00:42:52.96,00:42:52.96,SO I'M NOT REAL SURPRISED
999,00:42:54.67,00:42:54.67,BECAUSE IT'S A GAME THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
1000,00:42:56.04,00:42:56.04,AND GUESS WHAT?
1001,00:42:57.04,00:42:57.04,ANYTHING HAPPENED.
