812,00:34:36.96,00:34:36.96,WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO.
813,00:34:56.25,00:34:56.25,>> Jeff: ALINA.

817,00:35:03.04,00:35:03.04,">> UM, COMING TOGETHER,"
818,00:35:04.75,00:35:04.75,"IT WAS NICE AT THE BEGINNING,OBVIOUSLY."
819,00:35:06.79,00:35:06.79,BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
820,00:35:08.88,00:35:08.88,"THE OLD LA FLOR TRIBE,"
821,00:35:10.29,00:35:10.29,"WE LIVED THE WAY WE LIVED,"
822,00:35:11.54,00:35:11.54,"WE HAD THE WAY WE DID THINGS,"
823,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,SO THERE'S A LITTLE BITOF TURF WARS.
824,00:35:15.33,00:35:15.33,"NOW THAT WE'RE ON ESPADA'S TURF,"
825,00:35:17.88,00:35:17.88,WE KIND OF HAVE TO GOWITH THEIR RULES.

829,00:35:25.25,00:35:25.25,>> YEAH.
830,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,TYRONE SEEMS TO BE THE BOSS MANAROUND ESPADA.
831,00:35:29.88,00:35:29.88,"HE'S GOT AN ASSERTIVEPERSONALITY,"
832,00:35:31.42,00:35:31.42,"A LOUD VOICE,AND WHAT HE SAYS USUALLY GOES."
833,00:35:34.21,00:35:34.21,>> Jeff: TYRONE?

835,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,>> Jeff: WHAT COMES WITH BEINGTHE LEADER OF THIS TRIBE?
836,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17,>> IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY
837,00:35:40.83,00:35:40.83,"BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK TO YOUFOR ANSWERS,"
838,00:35:42.71,00:35:42.71,INSIGHT AND WISDOM SO TO SPEAK.

844,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,"BASICALLY WHEN I LEAD,I TAKE INPUT FROM OTHERS."
845,00:35:56.83,00:35:56.83,"I DON'T MAKEUNILATERAL DECISIONS,"
846,00:35:59.08,00:35:59.08,SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT ALINASAID THERE WERE TURF WARS.
847,00:36:02.71,00:36:02.71,MAYBE WE CAN ADDRESS THEM
848,00:36:04.12,00:36:04.12,BECAUSE I WANT IT TO BEAS SMOOTH AS IT CAN BE
849,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED.
850,00:36:08.71,00:36:08.71,">> Jeff: WELL, NOW'S A GOOD TIMETO ADDRESS THEM."
851,00:36:10.54,00:36:10.54,"ALINA, YOU WANT TO SHAREWITH TYRONE"

854,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,LIKE THIS IS HOW THIS GOES.
855,00:36:19.79,00:36:19.79,"WE'VE BEEN SURVIVING, TOO."
856,00:36:21.79,00:36:21.79,>> Jeff: SO YOU FELTA LITTLE LIKE A CHILD?
857,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,>> A LITTLE BIT LIKE A CHILD.

859,00:36:27.21,00:36:27.21,"I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY DID ITAT LA FLOR,"
860,00:36:29.58,00:36:29.58,BUT ALL I WAS TRYING TO DOWAS INTRODUCE THEM.
861,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT
862,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,IF I WAS LAYING DOWN THE LAW.
863,00:36:34.58,00:36:34.58,"SO THAT WASN'T MY INTENT,"
864,00:36:36.25,00:36:36.25,IF IT WAS RECEIVED THAT WAY.
865,00:36:37.92,00:36:37.92,"I GUESS MAYBE THAT'STHE GENERATION GAP, YOU KNOW."
866,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,SO I DON'T KNOW.
867,00:36:41.42,00:36:41.42,">> Jeff: ALINA, WHAT'S BEEN THETOUGHEST DAY OUT HERE SO FAR?"
868,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,>> I THINK IT'S THE NIGHTSTHAT ARE TOUGH.
869,00:36:47.54,00:36:47.54,ESPECIALLY LAST TWO NIGHTS.
870,00:36:49.38,00:36:49.38,THEY WERE REALLY RAINY.
871,00:36:50.62,00:36:50.62,EVERYBODY WAS DRENCHEDAND IT WAS COLD.
872,00:36:52.54,00:36:52.54,I THINK THAT'S THE TOUGHEST PARTTO GET THROUGH.
873,00:36:54.75,00:36:54.75,">> Jeff: NAONKA, WHAT HAS BEENTHE DARKEST STORM FOR YOU?"
874,00:36:58.17,00:36:58.17,">> OH, MY GOSH."

876,00:37:01.50,00:37:01.50,I WAS FREEZING.
877,00:37:02.96,00:37:02.96,I WAS SHAKING.
878,00:37:04.42,00:37:04.42,I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WASGONNA BE THIS DIFFICULT FOR ME.
879,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,>> Jeff: COMPARE IT.
880,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,WHAT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING

882,00:37:11.08,00:37:11.08,">> GETTING A DIVORCE AT 26, 27."
883,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,THAT'S BEEN THE HARDEST THINGFOR ME.

887,00:37:23.71,00:37:23.71,AND THAT WAS TOUGH.
888,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,AND I COULDN'T SHIELD MYSELFFROM THAT PARTICULAR STORM.
889,00:37:28.96,00:37:28.96,HERE I HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM
890,00:37:30.79,00:37:30.79,AND I HAVE A SAFETY NET.
891,00:37:32.08,00:37:32.08,AND I DIDN'T HAVE THAT
892,00:37:33.58,00:37:33.58,WHEN I WAS GOINGTHROUGH THE DIVORCE.
893,00:37:35.79,00:37:35.79,>> Jeff: THAT'S GOT TO BLOWYOUR MIND A BIT.

899,00:37:48.12,00:37:48.12,AND IT WAS TOUGHFOR ME TO OPEN UP AND TELL THEM
900,00:37:49.92,00:37:49.92,BUT THEY HAD A LOTOF ENCOURAGING WORDS.
901,00:37:51.58,00:37:51.58,>> Jeff: SO IT SOUNDS LIKETHIS WAS A MONUMENTAL NIGHT.
