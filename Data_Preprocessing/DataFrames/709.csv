4,00:00:09.37,00:00:09.37,Grab your torches. Get fire.
5,00:00:11.27,00:00:11.27,(thunderclap) Burton returned to the Drake
6,00:00:13.57,00:00:13.57,"Tribe. >> Welcome back, Burton."
7,00:00:15.17,00:00:15.17,>> Welcome back. >> We definitely traded up.
8,00:00:19.53,00:00:19.53,">> PROBST: Lill returned to  Morgan, still feeling"
9,00:00:22.27,00:00:22.27,vulnerable. >> I just didn't feel like
10,00:00:24.63,00:00:24.63,part of a group. I just didn't fit in.
11,00:00:28.67,00:00:28.67,>> I don't think she trusts me at all because I was partially
12,00:00:31.13,00:00:31.13,responsible for voting her out. >> PROBST: When the tribes
13,00:00:33.93,00:00:33.93,"arrived for the challenge, they were surprised once again."
14,00:00:36.40,00:00:36.40,"Drop your buffs. >> Oh, my God!"
15,00:00:38.10,00:00:38.10,>> PROBST: This time with the merge-- Drake is no more.
16,00:00:40.23,00:00:40.23,Morgan is no more. You are one tribe.
17,00:00:42.80,00:00:42.80,Survivors ready? Go!
18,00:00:44.70,00:00:44.70,The first individual immunity challenge was a close race
19,00:00:48.90,00:00:48.90,"between Rupert and Burton, but in the end..."
20,00:00:51.37,00:00:51.37,Burton wins immunity! (chuckling)
21,00:00:54.17,00:00:54.17,The new Balboa Tribe enjoyed a feast.
22,00:00:56.30,00:00:56.30,>> To Balboa! >> Balboa!
23,00:00:57.90,00:00:57.90,>> PROBST: But the camaraderie didn't last.
24,00:00:59.93,00:00:59.93,>> We need to figure out who goes first.
25,00:01:01.87,00:01:01.87,I can't stand Little Jon. He's arrogant.
26,00:01:03.83,00:01:03.83,"He's out for himself, and we would love to see him go."
27,00:01:06.07,00:01:06.07,>> PROBST: And Lill considered an offer from the former Drakes.
28,00:01:12.77,00:01:12.77,>> They're all offering friendship.
29,00:01:14.30,00:01:14.30,"Whether or not I can trust all this, I can't really say."
30,00:01:17.63,00:01:17.63,">> If Lill goes to the bad guys, we're in serious trouble."
31,00:01:21.10,00:01:21.10,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Burton gave immunity to Rupert."
32,00:01:23.93,00:01:23.93,And Lill turned on her former Morgan Tribe when she helped
33,00:01:27.87,00:01:27.87,vote Andrew out of the game. The tribe has spoken.
34,00:01:32.70,00:01:32.70,Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

37,00:02:14.33,00:02:14.33,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> I'm feeling great.
38,00:02:58.17,00:02:58.17,"I'm feeling really, really good."
39,00:03:01.43,00:03:01.43,It's like the difference between night and day.
40,00:03:05.57,00:03:05.57,"I turned on my, uh, Morgan Tribe."
41,00:03:08.43,00:03:08.43,I... I had no reason to stay with them.
42,00:03:11.50,00:03:11.50,I would have been voted off with another:
43,00:03:14.60,00:03:14.60,"""She's got great work ethic. She's really nice lady,"
44,00:03:17.53,00:03:17.53,"but see you around."" And usually, I have regrets"
45,00:03:22.73,00:03:22.73,"stabbing someone in the back, but this time,"
46,00:03:27.27,00:03:27.27,I feel like I stood up for myself.
47,00:03:29.53,00:03:29.53,"You know, I was no longer... the Cincinnati workhorse."
48,00:03:36.47,00:03:36.47,"You know, I was Lill. It was just nice."
49,00:03:41.23,00:03:41.23,I have blossomed more in the last two days
50,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,"with just a hug or a kind word. Whatever you guys decide,"
51,00:03:50.50,00:03:50.50,I'm with the team. >> You'll be the last Morgan
52,00:03:52.80,00:03:52.80,in it because you're a Drake. And if you can win that
53,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,"immunity, I'll put a Drake out before you."
54,00:03:58.67,00:03:58.67,>> Be serious. (laughing)
55,00:04:02.07,00:04:02.07,">> Don't be, don't... don't do that to yourself."
56,00:04:05.07,00:04:05.07,You stood up... You were the lion and you stood
57,00:04:07.03,00:04:07.03,up to Savage. Stand up to anything.
58,00:04:10.17,00:04:10.17,"Don't give up. >> No, I'm not going to."
59,00:04:13.33,00:04:13.33,(distant thunder rolling) >> Tribal Council for me sucked
60,00:04:22.30,00:04:22.30,last night because Lill decided she was going to switch
61,00:04:25.70,00:04:25.70,to the other tribe because she's pissed off at Andrew.
62,00:04:28.37,00:04:28.37,Me and Andrew had a tight bond straight from the beginning.
63,00:04:31.17,00:04:31.17,And it was... it was cool. I was bummed to see him go.
64,00:04:35.13,00:04:35.13,"So, I'm basically next on the chopping block,"
65,00:04:37.70,00:04:37.70,"and, uh, it sucks. >> I don't know."
66,00:05:03.30,00:05:03.30,>> You know the four of them are tight.
67,00:05:06.37,00:05:06.37,">> Yeah. >> I mean, Rupert-Rupert sees"
68,00:05:09.00,00:05:09.00,"you as a threat, so... >> You just got to just watch"
69,00:05:11.47,00:05:11.47,"out, dude, because you're on the chopping block pretty soon."
70,00:05:14.27,00:05:14.27,>> Yeah. I had talked to Burton
71,00:05:16.30,00:05:16.30,this morning to feel out how he was feeling about the Drake
72,00:05:18.90,00:05:18.90,"Tribe. I go, ""Hey, man, they voted you"
73,00:05:20.13,00:05:20.13,"out before. What makes you think, you know,"
74,00:05:22.93,00:05:22.93,"after I'm gone, you're not the next to go"
75,00:05:24.87,00:05:24.87,"because you're the next strongest person?"""
76,00:05:26.77,00:05:26.77,"Well, I mean, if you want, if I could get the two girls,"
77,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"and if you could get Lill, you know, we could kind of"
78,00:05:32.23,00:05:32.23,"control our own destiny, if you feel comfortable"
79,00:05:34.07,00:05:34.07,with that. >> Yeah.
80,00:05:36.27,00:05:36.27,"Ryan's trying to convince me that Rupert, Sandra, Christa,"
81,00:05:40.73,00:05:40.73,"and Jon are a very tight group of four, and they will vote me"
82,00:05:44.97,00:05:44.97,out. I know they still have
83,00:05:46.87,00:05:46.87,some hesitations about me because they know I want to win
84,00:05:49.57,00:05:49.57,"this game. What he's saying is,"
85,00:05:51.33,00:05:51.33,"he could get himself, Darrah and Tijuana."
86,00:05:54.40,00:05:54.40,"If I could get Lill, we'd have five, and we could run them out"
87,00:05:57.50,00:05:57.50,and then go from there. >> I don't know how close you
88,00:05:59.63,00:05:59.63,"are with Jon or any of those guys, but, I mean, I know"
89,00:06:02.03,00:06:02.03,they voted for you. >> Yeah.
90,00:06:03.50,00:06:03.50,">> You know what I mean? >> Yeah. No, I-I definitely"
91,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,"hear what you're saying. At this point in the game,"
92,00:06:08.33,00:06:08.33,"there's a lot of things going on, and there's a lot of"
93,00:06:10.77,00:06:10.77,possibilities of where the game could go.
94,00:06:13.73,00:06:13.73,>> Just... Just think about it because...
95,00:06:17.57,00:06:17.57,"they voted you out once, and they welcomed you back,"
96,00:06:20.50,00:06:20.50,"but then again, you know, we welcomed Lill back,"
97,00:06:23.43,00:06:23.43,and look what she did to us. >> Ow.
98,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77,"These things don't have electric stuff in them, do they?"
99,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17,>> Uh-uh. There is an ele...
100,00:07:18.53,00:07:18.53,">> Are you sure, dude? Come up and stick your finger"
101,00:07:21.13,00:07:21.13,"in here. So, I went out to get a stingray"
102,00:07:23.37,00:07:23.37,and actually took the stingray off the spear while it was still
103,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,"alive, and was holding it... Stick your finger..."
104,00:07:28.20,00:07:28.20,"your... No, in those holes."
105,00:07:30.43,00:07:30.43,"Well, now you're freaking me out."
106,00:07:32.50,00:07:32.50,(laughs) >> Wow!
107,00:07:33.90,00:07:33.90,"It's an electric ray. >> Oh, my God."
108,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,>> Is it really? >> I kept trying to hold it
109,00:07:38.90,00:07:38.90,"down, and it kept shocking me, so, it-it's some type"
110,00:07:40.83,00:07:40.83,"of electric stingray, (laughs): but it let out"
111,00:07:43.43,00:07:43.43,a pretty good charge a number of times.
112,00:07:45.17,00:07:45.17,"Stick your finger back in there, dude."
113,00:07:46.80,00:07:46.80,>> I don't want to stick my finger back in there.
114,00:07:49.10,00:07:49.10,I don't think... >> (screams)
115,00:07:50.77,00:07:50.77,">> Ow! God, that one got me good."
116,00:07:52.37,00:07:52.37,"(laughing) Son of a bitch, dude."
117,00:07:54.13,00:07:54.13,">> Oh, my God, we're eating stingray."
118,00:07:56.83,00:07:56.83,>> Shockingly good. >> It's shockingly good.
119,00:08:00.07,00:08:00.07,">> Mm-hmm. >> Yes, sir."
120,00:08:03.70,00:08:03.70,That's a high-voltage meal. >> Mm-hmm. Very good.
121,00:08:07.27,00:08:07.27,">> Mm, yeah, I like it. (laughter)"
122,00:08:11.53,00:08:11.53,"Food, food, food. Everything is nice over here."
123,00:08:15.37,00:08:15.37,>> Take that. >> No. You eat it.
124,00:08:16.97,00:08:16.97,">> Take that. >> I'm good, really."
125,00:08:18.50,00:08:18.50,"Seriously, I'm good. Thank you. >> Okay."
126,00:08:21.00,00:08:21.00,">> Um, they have food all the time."
127,00:08:22.83,00:08:22.83,It's just... it's so not where I come from.
128,00:08:25.00,00:08:25.00,They've got it going well. They've got great food.
129,00:08:27.87,00:08:27.87,Rupert does a lot of fishing and hunting.
130,00:08:30.23,00:08:30.23,"Burton-- he caught the stingray. So, it's very exciting for me."
131,00:08:33.93,00:08:33.93,Very exciting. >> Take your pick.
132,00:08:36.33,00:08:36.33,Grab one. Whichever.
133,00:08:38.57,00:08:38.57,"Gut it and scale it, and we'll filet it."
134,00:08:40.73,00:08:40.73,"I hope that all of the former Morgans, now Balboas,"
135,00:08:45.67,00:08:45.67,feel comfortable enough to eat as much as they want.
136,00:08:48.53,00:08:48.53,>> Mmm. >> There is always meat in the
137,00:08:51.30,00:08:51.30,cheeks. I like that feeling of being
138,00:08:55.10,00:08:55.10,able to fill you up and make you feel comfortable.
139,00:08:57.97,00:08:57.97,"I mean, I'm looking at these guys."
140,00:08:59.70,00:08:59.70,Their body... They're just emaciated from lack
141,00:09:01.63,00:09:01.63,of food. It's sad.
142,00:09:26.53,00:09:26.53,>> PROBST: Welcome to your first individual reward challenge.
143,00:09:31.13,00:09:31.13,It's pretty simple. Here's how it works.
144,00:09:33.00,00:09:33.00,You're gonna use slingshots to fire marbles at targets
145,00:09:36.23,00:09:36.23,"on your mast. Each time you hit a target,"
146,00:09:38.97,00:09:38.97,it ignites the next target. First person to hit all three
147,00:09:41.50,00:09:41.50,targets and ignite the crow's nest of your mast wins.
148,00:09:46.03,00:09:46.03,We'll work in groups of three. Three people in each round.
149,00:09:49.57,00:09:49.57,The winners from each round move on to the final.
150,00:09:51.43,00:09:51.43,"You have to hit your targets in order, from bottom to top."
151,00:09:54.93,00:09:54.93,"If you hit a target out of order, you're out of the game."
152,00:09:57.57,00:09:57.57,Make sense? Want to know what you're playing
153,00:09:59.70,00:09:59.70,for? >> Yeah.
154,00:10:00.50,00:10:00.50,>> Definitely. >> PROBST: Something you haven't
155,00:10:02.40,00:10:02.40,had in a long time: breakfast. Here's a little tease.
156,00:10:05.63,00:10:05.63,(women sighing) >> PROBST: One very small
157,00:10:08.07,00:10:08.07,"sweet roll. Burton, I'll start with you."
158,00:10:10.33,00:10:10.33,You can figure out how to deal with it.
159,00:10:12.30,00:10:12.30,So your reward will be everything that comes
160,00:10:15.13,00:10:15.13,"with a good breakfast: pancakes and syrup,"
161,00:10:17.73,00:10:17.73,"bacon and eggs, lots of croissant, jam,"
162,00:10:21.40,00:10:21.40,"plenty of sweet rolls, big old pitcher of orange juice,"
163,00:10:24.83,00:10:24.83,nice scenery... a little break from the game.
164,00:10:27.93,00:10:27.93,Boat'll pick you up in the morning.
165,00:10:29.50,00:10:29.50,"Worth playing for? >> Hell, yeah."
166,00:10:31.67,00:10:31.67,">> PROBST: All right, we'll draw numbers to figure out your"
167,00:10:33.87,00:10:33.87,positions. Wait for my go.
168,00:10:37.47,00:10:37.47,"Okay, we've randomly drawn numbers."
169,00:10:39.70,00:10:39.70,"First three, come up, take your spots."
170,00:10:41.80,00:10:41.80,"Sandra, Ryno and Darrah. Winner of this round will"
171,00:10:45.17,00:10:45.17,move on to the final. First shots.
172,00:10:47.53,00:10:47.53,"Ready, aim, fire. There it is."
173,00:10:52.97,00:10:52.97,(cheering) Sandra connects.
174,00:10:55.43,00:10:55.43,">> And I hit myself in the mouth, too."
175,00:10:57.10,00:10:57.10,I'm a come out of here with a busted lip.
176,00:10:58.80,00:10:58.80,>> PROBST: Hits her first target.
177,00:10:59.93,00:10:59.93,">> I want pancakes. >> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire."
178,00:11:04.17,00:11:04.17,Ryno knocked it off. That'll work.
179,00:11:07.87,00:11:07.87,"Ryno and Sandra on the board. Ready, aim, fire."
180,00:11:14.53,00:11:14.53,">> Oh, man! >> You cracked it,"
181,00:11:16.10,00:11:16.10,"but it didn't break. >> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire."
182,00:11:19.63,00:11:19.63,Sandra! (cheering)
183,00:11:22.43,00:11:22.43,Busts hers. Sandra connects again.
184,00:11:26.87,00:11:26.87,Ryno still can't get that plate to break.
185,00:11:28.73,00:11:28.73,"Ready, aim, fire. There it is for Ryno."
186,00:11:35.23,00:11:35.23,">> Oh, hell. >> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire."
187,00:11:38.93,00:11:38.93,"Oh, Ryno moving on to the next round."
188,00:11:43.00,00:11:43.00,"Next three, come on up. Burton, Rupert and Jon."
189,00:11:45.40,00:11:45.40,Ryno's already moved into the the final.
190,00:11:48.60,00:11:48.60,Which one of you three will join him?
191,00:11:50.53,00:11:50.53,"Ready, aim, fire. Rupert connects."
192,00:11:55.03,00:11:55.03,"(clapping) >> You go, boy."
193,00:11:56.57,00:11:56.57,Right away he's on the board. >> PROBST: Here we go.
194,00:11:58.67,00:11:58.67,"Ready, aim, fire. Rupert connects."
195,00:12:02.90,00:12:02.90,Jon hits out of order. Jon's out of the game.
196,00:12:06.83,00:12:06.83,Have a seat. One more challenge Jon cannot
197,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,finish. (laughing)
198,00:12:11.73,00:12:11.73,">> We still love you though, buddy."
199,00:12:13.70,00:12:13.70,">> PROBST: Rupert quickly on the board with two plates,"
200,00:12:15.93,00:12:15.93,only needs one more target to move on to the final.

208,00:12:44.10,00:12:44.10,"form. Ready, aim, fire."
209,00:12:50.73,00:12:50.73,T connects. She's on the board.
210,00:12:52.83,00:12:52.83,"Oh, man! Hits her name."
211,00:12:55.57,00:12:55.57,"She's gonna kill somebody. Ready, aim, fire."
212,00:13:02.40,00:13:02.40,"There it is, Lill. >> Go, Lill."
213,00:13:05.50,00:13:05.50,">> Thank you, Lord. >> PROBST: Lill and T on the"

216,00:13:18.10,00:13:18.10,It's close. Give it a kick.
217,00:13:21.43,00:13:21.43,Wind may help. (screaming)
218,00:13:22.90,00:13:22.90,"There it goes. Ready, aim, fire."
219,00:13:32.63,00:13:32.63,"Oh, man, T., you are destroying that plate."

223,00:13:48.87,00:13:48.87,We got a showdown: Lill and T both need one more hit.
224,00:13:52.20,00:13:52.20,"Ready, aim, fire. Lill does it!"
225,00:13:56.33,00:13:56.33,"Lill moves on to the final. >> Good job, Lill."

231,00:14:15.83,00:14:15.83,"Ready, aim, fire. Lill hits her second target."

241,00:15:00.93,00:15:00.93,Here's the deal. Breakfast alone is no fun at
242,00:15:03.03,00:15:03.03,all. >> Right.
243,00:15:04.97,00:15:04.97,>> PROBST: You can choose somebody to go with you tomorrow

246,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27,"have a nice breakfast. Or, if you like, you can give"
247,00:15:14.90,00:15:14.90,your breakfast to somebody else. Let them choose someone
248,00:15:17.73,00:15:17.73,to go with them. >> Go.
249,00:15:19.17,00:15:19.17,>> PROBST: Your choice. >> Give it away.
250,00:15:20.73,00:15:20.73,"Give it away, Rupert. >> Don't do it, Rupert."
251,00:15:22.20,00:15:22.20,>> Got to give that away. >> Burton gave me the immunity
252,00:15:25.13,00:15:25.13,last night. I'll give him the breakfast.
253,00:15:27.67,00:15:27.67,">> No, dude, I was kidding. >> PROBST: Burton, come up"
254,00:15:29.80,00:15:29.80,"front. Rupert, you're going in the"
255,00:15:31.67,00:15:31.67,"back. Burton, you're going to"
256,00:15:32.90,00:15:32.90,breakfast and you're taking somebody with you.
257,00:15:34.47,00:15:34.47,You cannot take Rupert. He gave it up.
258,00:15:36.57,00:15:36.57,Who's going? >> Take Lill.
259,00:15:39.40,00:15:39.40,>> Lill. >> PROBST: Burton and Lill going
260,00:15:41.83,00:15:41.83,to breakfast in the morning. Boat'll pick you up.
261,00:15:44.00,00:15:44.00,Have a good time. >> I have no money to give you.
262,00:15:47.50,00:15:47.50,">> PROBST: Guys, head on back to camp."
263,00:16:08.97,00:16:08.97,>> Voted out of the game by your tribe and then voted back into
264,00:16:13.80,00:16:13.80,the same tribe has been interesting.
265,00:16:16.30,00:16:16.30,"I am doing my best to act like, ""Hey, I'm Drake."
266,00:16:19.10,00:16:19.10,"I'm Drake. I'm Drake."" That's a bunch of... lies."
267,00:16:24.93,00:16:24.93,I want to win this game for the Outcast Tribe and those of us
268,00:16:27.17,00:16:27.17,"who got kicked out, so I sort of think about it as,"
269,00:16:30.00,00:16:30.00,"as far as my actions, I have no loyalty"
270,00:16:32.30,00:16:32.30,whatsoever to Drake. Either I really slept late
271,00:16:34.83,00:16:34.83,or everybody got up early. Nor do I have any loyalty
272,00:16:38.90,00:16:38.90,"to Christa, Sandra or Rupert because I know they would all"
273,00:16:41.57,00:16:41.57,stab me in the back the second they got a chance.
274,00:16:44.03,00:16:44.03,">> I love you. >> I love you, too, baby."
275,00:16:47.07,00:16:47.07,">> Thank you. >> We cannot beat Rupert,"
276,00:16:51.63,00:16:51.63,"Sandra or Christa, and we cannot even separate them."
277,00:16:55.13,00:16:55.13,No one can. >> Yep.
278,00:16:57.07,00:16:57.07,">> For that reason alone, it might be worth taking Rupert"
279,00:16:59.33,00:16:59.33,out. >> We're crazy if we don't.
280,00:17:02.27,00:17:02.27,"I mean, that's... that's numbers, man."
281,00:17:04.00,00:17:04.00,>> Would you tell Rupert before or just blindside him?
282,00:17:06.20,00:17:06.20,>> Think we'd have to blindside him.
283,00:17:07.90,00:17:07.90,What do you think? >> I'm just afraid if we
284,00:17:10.47,00:17:10.47,"told him, he would lose it. I know he would."
285,00:17:13.00,00:17:13.00,>> It's not hard for me to align with anybody that
286,00:17:15.57,00:17:15.57,I know is going to help me. Burton knows how devious I am.
287,00:17:18.53,00:17:18.53,"Therefore he feels I'd be the perfect person to go,"
288,00:17:20.90,00:17:20.90,go along with his plan with him. He was exactly right.
289,00:17:24.03,00:17:24.03,"He's definitely my strongest ally remaining in the game,"
290,00:17:26.83,00:17:26.83,"and that's the guy that I helped see get out of the game,"
291,00:17:30.30,00:17:30.30,"so that's pretty funny. Irony, uh..."
292,00:17:32.17,00:17:32.17,irony definitely plays a strong hand in this game.
293,00:17:37.83,00:17:37.83,">> Rupert, Sandra and Christa will get rid of everyone."
294,00:17:40.00,00:17:40.00,Those three will go to the final three
295,00:17:41.90,00:17:41.90,and will not take anyone else. >> Who?
296,00:17:44.27,00:17:44.27,">> Rupert, Christa and Sandra. >> So we got to get rid"
297,00:17:47.17,00:17:47.17,of one of them. >> We got to get rid of all of
298,00:17:49.77,00:17:49.77,"them. >> Oh, heck, I'm looking"
299,00:17:52.07,00:17:52.07,"forward to this breakfast, yes. I'm anxious, uh..."
300,00:17:54.03,00:17:54.03,I'm anxious to talk more than eat.
301,00:17:57.03,00:17:57.03,"Oh, I'm gonna eat, but, you know, I'm anxious to talk,"
302,00:17:59.77,00:17:59.77,'cause I need to know what's going on.
303,00:18:02.53,00:18:02.53,"Oh, baby! Oh, baby, oh."
304,00:18:23.40,00:18:23.40,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Oh, my gosh, look at this."
305,00:18:34.83,00:18:34.83,This is so beautiful. Whoo!
306,00:18:38.90,00:18:38.90,We came to this place that was just rock and sand.
307,00:18:44.80,00:18:44.80,There was no green... nothing.
308,00:18:46.77,00:18:46.77,"(gasps) Oh, my gosh!"
309,00:18:50.73,00:18:50.73,"And on top of the sand was this gazebo,"
310,00:18:53.73,00:18:53.73,and it was beautiful. Look at these flowers.
311,00:18:58.03,00:18:58.03,">> Oh, my Lord. This buffet was just"
312,00:19:01.00,00:19:01.00,"out of control. I mean, things that we haven't"
313,00:19:03.20,00:19:03.20,"even seen for, you know, three weeks now."
314,00:19:06.63,00:19:06.63,Oh. I'm going to get sick as a dog.
315,00:19:09.37,00:19:09.37,">> Look at the bacon, okay? Rupert."
316,00:19:12.50,00:19:12.50,>> That's for Rupert. >> Mm.
317,00:19:15.27,00:19:15.27,>> This is ridiculous. >> Blackberries.
318,00:19:19.60,00:19:19.60,"(chuckles) Well, I say we get started."
319,00:19:22.37,00:19:22.37,>> Okay. They had...
320,00:19:24.13,00:19:24.13,"eggs, pancakes, bacon, and sausage."
321,00:19:27.83,00:19:27.83,"(gasps) Oh, my gosh."
322,00:19:31.43,00:19:31.43,"(gasps) Apple juice, I want apple juice."
323,00:19:33.83,00:19:33.83,>> You don't drink champagne? >> No.
324,00:19:34.90,00:19:34.90,">> God, I'm gonna blow this thing out."
325,00:19:36.40,00:19:36.40,"Well, I'm gonna watch you. Well, I'm not much"
326,00:19:38.63,00:19:38.63,"on the drinking part. Now, the young man"
327,00:19:40.73,00:19:40.73,"that I was with, Burton, his eyes get real big."
328,00:19:42.80,00:19:42.80,Why do you do that? >> It should explode.
329,00:19:46.17,00:19:46.17,">> So, I said, ""Okay, I'll drink the apple juice, and you can"
330,00:19:48.73,00:19:48.73,"drink the champagne."" To the Drake Tribe-- oh!"
331,00:19:51.70,00:19:51.70,How cool is that? >> To the Outcasts.
332,00:19:54.20,00:19:54.20,>> To the Outcasts. >> Taking it home.
333,00:19:55.53,00:19:55.53,">> Mm-hmm. As the Outcasts, Burton and I,"
334,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,we were going to form a bond. We have a strong alliance there.
335,00:20:02.77,00:20:02.77,I have to believe this young man.
336,00:20:04.70,00:20:04.70,And I'm going to put everything that I have into what he wants
337,00:20:07.63,00:20:07.63,me to do. >> Here's the deal: we've got
338,00:20:10.17,00:20:10.17,to get Rupert off right now. He's the mastermind behind
339,00:20:12.87,00:20:12.87,"everything, and he has those two girls in his back pocket"
340,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,like there's no tomorrow. >> Okay.
341,00:20:17.37,00:20:17.37,">> If you get Tijuana and Darrah to vote against Rupert, do you"
342,00:20:20.77,00:20:20.77,"think Tijuana would... Tijuana would jump, if it was a"
343,00:20:23.53,00:20:23.53,matter of staying three more... >> I think either girl would.
344,00:20:26.07,00:20:26.07,">> And if Rupert does win immunity, we have to get rid of"
345,00:20:28.50,00:20:28.50,"Christa, and then Rupert'll be scrambling."
346,00:20:30.27,00:20:30.27,My relationship with Lill is that we experienced
347,00:20:32.90,00:20:32.90,the same thing. We both got kicked out;
348,00:20:34.67,00:20:34.67,we're both back in the game. So she's kind of my trump card
349,00:20:37.43,00:20:37.43,"right now. Okay, so, you need to make"
350,00:20:39.70,00:20:39.70,"friends with Christa and say, ""Listen, I'm going along with"
351,00:20:42.00,00:20:42.00,whatever you guys want. Let me know how you want me to
352,00:20:44.47,00:20:44.47,"vote, and I'll continue to vote that way."""
353,00:20:46.43,00:20:46.43,">> See, now it's starting to lie and I'm gonna have a problem"
354,00:20:48.90,00:20:48.90,"with that... I know, I know, I know, I know!"
355,00:20:58.53,00:20:58.53,>> Are you ready for conditioner?
356,00:20:59.77,00:20:59.77,>> Sure. Rinse good.
357,00:21:04.90,00:21:04.90,">> So, you're saying that it's possible for me, you,"
358,00:21:07.27,00:21:07.27,and Lill to get rid of Rupert and Burton.
359,00:21:09.53,00:21:09.53,>> Sandra and I were scheming about how we might be able
360,00:21:12.07,00:21:12.07,"to get rid of Rupert from, uh, this game..."
361,00:21:15.13,00:21:15.13,also Burton. They're both very strong
362,00:21:17.07,00:21:17.07,competitors. I have a feeling if we don't
363,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,"do it earlier on, then... there's a problem, you know?"
364,00:21:24.23,00:21:24.23,"'Cause they're still the strongest people out here,"
365,00:21:26.90,00:21:26.90,you know? >> Mm-hmm.
366,00:21:28.30,00:21:28.30,"Okay, let your hair stay with this conditioner."
367,00:21:29.93,00:21:29.93,">> Burton's got to go first. I mean, he's definitely"
368,00:21:33.17,00:21:33.17,the stronger of the two in the long run.
369,00:21:36.03,00:21:36.03,>> What if we got rid of Burton and kept the two females around?
370,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,And then we'd still be us five girls.
371,00:21:42.17,00:21:42.17,>> Maybe the girls are the better people to keep around.
372,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,We got to orchestrate this well. >> Me and Christa definitely do
373,00:21:49.07,00:21:49.07,"feel vulnerable, because Burton and Rupert"
374,00:21:52.37,00:21:52.37,are the only ones that bring anything
375,00:21:54.53,00:21:54.53,"from in the ocean to us to eat-- fish, stingray, whatever."
376,00:22:01.80,00:22:01.80,">> All right, girls. let's go find us a meal,"
377,00:22:05.30,00:22:05.30,"so we can survive, maybe, on this island without any men."
378,00:22:09.40,00:22:09.40,(laughs) >> Is that the goal?
379,00:22:13.50,00:22:13.50,">> Follow, Christa. >> Why-- you want to come along?"

569,00:31:50.00,00:31:50.00,"That is wrong. Rupert says ""dory."""
570,00:31:52.17,00:31:52.17,A dory is a flat-bottomed fishing boat.
571,00:31:54.70,00:31:54.70,You are right-- you would not find that
572,00:31:56.77,00:31:56.77,in a buried treasure. Go ahead and make
573,00:31:59.23,00:31:59.23,"the ceremonial last placing... >> Oh, my heart breaks."
574,00:32:01.50,00:32:01.50,">> PROBST: ...of the coconut. >> Oh, mine too, baby."
575,00:32:04.27,00:32:04.27,I'm glad to get the chance to put you out instead of anyone
576,00:32:06.27,00:32:06.27,else. >> Thank you.
577,00:32:07.60,00:32:07.60,">> PROBST: And with that, Rupert has immunity."
578,00:32:10.03,00:32:10.03,"Rupert, come on over. Turn around and slap it on."
579,00:32:15.83,00:32:15.83,"Right there. Tonight, Tribal Council,"
580,00:32:19.30,00:32:19.30,Rupert is safe. Everybody else is vulnerable.
581,00:32:22.13,00:32:22.13,You guys have this afternoon to think about
582,00:32:24.70,00:32:24.70,what should be a very interesting vote.
583,00:32:26.13,00:32:26.13,Head back to camp. Congratulations.
584,00:32:28.13,00:32:28.13,>> Thank you. >> Yeah.
585,00:32:46.83,00:32:46.83,(Rupert laughing) I didn't want you
586,00:32:49.47,00:32:49.47,to feel lonely. (Rupert laughing)
587,00:32:52.00,00:32:52.00,>> I didn't feel lonely. I didn't...
588,00:32:53.40,00:32:53.40,I don't want damn coconuts in my thing.
589,00:32:55.47,00:32:55.47,>>  Every day's a new day. >> I know there's still a game 
590,00:32:59.27,00:32:59.27,"on, but it's, you know... it's hard not to get depressed"
591,00:33:01.53,00:33:01.53,"about things. I mean, I'm not a pessimist,"
592,00:33:03.80,00:33:03.80,"but, you know, you get so much crap thrown your way, it just"
593,00:33:06.57,00:33:06.57,like... It just keeps coming at you and keeps hammering you.
594,00:33:08.67,00:33:08.67,"You're just like, ""Oh, man. Again? Again? Again?"""
595,00:33:11.07,00:33:11.07,It's going to take a minor miracle to get back
596,00:33:13.47,00:33:13.47,"in this, but, you know, I'll try as hard as I can"
597,00:33:16.20,00:33:16.20,to get where I need to be. I'm not... I'm not gonna quit.
598,00:33:19.13,00:33:19.13,I'm-I'm gonna go down  swinging...(laughing)
599,00:33:20.93,00:33:20.93,"until I hear that bell. >> A while back,"
600,00:33:28.20,00:33:28.20,I talked to Burton to see if he would be interested
601,00:33:31.37,00:33:31.37,in going five on four. I've worked too hard.
602,00:33:35.17,00:33:35.17,"You've worked too hard. You know, I haven't given"
603,00:33:37.20,00:33:37.20,"up, but you guys need to... maybe work Lill"
604,00:33:39.30,00:33:39.30,"and be like, ""Hey, let's try to get the five"
605,00:33:42.47,00:33:42.47,"of us on four and do this."" They'd get smoked by us,"
606,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,and they wouldn't even see it coming.
607,00:33:47.63,00:33:47.63,>> Yeah. >> It'd be perfect.
608,00:33:51.67,00:33:51.67,">> Whoa, Ryno's scrambling, huh?"
609,00:33:53.57,00:33:53.57,">> Oh, my God, he's scrambling."
610,00:33:55.73,00:33:55.73,He's trying to suck Burton in.
611,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,"I told Burton, ""You... you cross me, I'll kill you."""
612,00:34:00.97,00:34:00.97,"(chuckles) >> He's like,"
613,00:34:03.00,00:34:03.00,"""No, no, no, no. ""That's why I gave"
614,00:34:04.87,00:34:04.87,you that immunity. I want you to know
615,00:34:06.37,00:34:06.37,"I'm on your side."" >> He means it, too."
616,00:34:08.10,00:34:08.10,">> It would be nice to go to Tribal Council,"
617,00:34:09.90,00:34:09.90,"get rid of Ryan, who is one of the..."
618,00:34:12.10,00:34:12.10,one of the leaders of the weak. You got some damn
619,00:34:15.23,00:34:15.23,good definition on your shoulders.
620,00:34:16.97,00:34:16.97,">> Well, thank you, Rupert. Ryan has the potential to band"
621,00:34:21.67,00:34:21.67,T. and Darrah and maybe suck
622,00:34:25.13,00:34:25.13,Jon and Burton in and give them five people
623,00:34:28.37,00:34:28.37,that they could just... they could steamroll over all of us.
624,00:34:31.97,00:34:31.97,"Over Sandra, Christa, I, and Lill."
625,00:34:37.70,00:34:37.70,"Now will they do that? I hope to God, no."
626,00:34:40.20,00:34:40.20,>> I don't know. I think the only chance is
627,00:34:43.23,00:34:43.23,"to get rid of Burton first. I mean, I don't"
628,00:34:45.27,00:34:45.27,"want to be a bitch, but I think the first"
629,00:34:47.37,00:34:47.37,"opportunity to get him off... I mean, just,"
630,00:34:49.80,00:34:49.80,I don't want him to win the whole freaking thing.
631,00:34:51.40,00:34:51.40,">> Yeah. >> I mean, I don't know..."
632,00:34:52.57,00:34:52.57,"I don't have a personal problem with him, but I just feel"
633,00:34:55.27,00:34:55.27,like he's a strong guy. He's mentally and physically
634,00:34:58.73,00:34:58.73,very strong. Rupe's back.
635,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40,"Ryno, that guy is the least trustable guy out of anyone"
636,00:35:04.97,00:35:04.97,here. >> Really?
637,00:35:08.40,00:35:08.40,>> Mm-hmm. >> Why roll the dice?
638,00:35:11.97,00:35:11.97,"You know, it's... it's stupid to let him even try, so..."
639,00:35:14.47,00:35:14.47,>> Mm-hmm. I'm not really sure
640,00:35:17.30,00:35:17.30,what to do right now. It's a very confusing situation.
641,00:35:20.50,00:35:20.50,It's a... I've never promised
642,00:35:21.83,00:35:21.83,"anybody anything out here, so I don't feel like I've lied"
643,00:35:25.80,00:35:25.80,to anybody quite yet. >> Ryno is like...
644,00:35:28.50,00:35:28.50,">> Dude, he's... >> He is scrambling."
645,00:35:31.23,00:35:31.23,">> ...at high red alert. Like, ""You know Sandra, Christa,"
646,00:35:33.80,00:35:33.80,"Rupert, and Jon all see you ""as a threat, they're a really"
647,00:35:37.43,00:35:37.43,"strong foursome, and as soon ""as it gets down to it,"
648,00:35:39.90,00:35:39.90,"you're gonna be ""next one to go,"
649,00:35:41.53,00:35:41.53,"you know that."" >> ""Jon's... Jon's a snake."
650,00:35:44.20,00:35:44.20,"He said he'd flip on you guys."" >> Yep."
651,00:35:45.80,00:35:45.80,">> He goes, ""It'd be a shame to, you know..."
652,00:35:47.60,00:35:47.60,"to know you worked so hard and got back into the game, then"
653,00:35:49.90,00:35:49.90,"just get voted right out again."" I'm like, ""Ooh, yeah, yeah,"
654,00:35:51.70,00:35:51.70,"I don't want that to happen."" >>  Burton and I see"
655,00:35:53.83,00:35:53.83,"how tight Rupert, Sandra, and Christa are."
656,00:35:56.73,00:35:56.73,"And, as a result, we know there's no chance with..."
657,00:35:59.77,00:35:59.77,for either one of us to go any further
658,00:36:01.90,00:36:01.90,"between the three, so something has to be done."
659,00:36:04.83,00:36:04.83,"I'm, I'm willing to go stab anybody in the back"
660,00:36:07.63,00:36:07.63,at any given time as long as it benefits me.
661,00:36:11.13,00:36:11.13,"I came into the game with that philosophy,"
662,00:36:12.87,00:36:12.87,and no friendships... no friendships have changed that
663,00:36:15.67,00:36:15.67,"thus far, and they're not going to--"
664,00:36:17.83,00:36:17.83,"day 22, day 23, 24, 38, doesn't matter."
665,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,">> Okay, we're off. So don't trust them."
666,00:36:28.80,00:36:28.80,"And if they trust me, cool, but they shouldn't."
667,00:36:48.57,00:36:48.57,">> PROBST: Let's get to it. Lill, start with you."
668,00:36:51.90,00:36:51.90,Two very adversarial tribes now forced to live together.
669,00:36:55.63,00:36:55.63,How is that going? >> It's been great for me.
670,00:36:58.53,00:36:58.53,"Um, I feel like I have a new family."
671,00:37:00.63,00:37:00.63,"I feel like I have, in the last few days,"
672,00:37:03.13,00:37:03.13,just to have come alive. More of my personality
673,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,"comes out. I feel myself laughing more,"
674,00:37:08.43,00:37:08.43,"and, uh... it's just a different"
675,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,"atmosphere for me. And, I..."
676,00:37:12.90,00:37:12.90,"I'm sorry, I love it. >> PROBST: Christa, do you"
677,00:37:15.23,00:37:15.23,notice a difference in the work ethic?
678,00:37:16.80,00:37:16.80,">> Well, uh, I wish there was more, you know, initiative."
679,00:37:20.67,00:37:20.67,"I just wish people would just get up and do something,"
680,00:37:22.87,00:37:22.87,"you know? It's like, ""What do we need?"""
681,00:37:25.13,00:37:25.13,"It's like, ""Look around."" Like, for example, today,"
682,00:37:28.30,00:37:28.30,"Darrah was sitting around talking with T.,"
683,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,and they were all just chatting away.
684,00:37:32.57,00:37:32.57,"And I don't want to be the one to be like, ""Hey, everybody,"
685,00:37:35.23,00:37:35.23,"we need firewood."" It's kind of like,"
686,00:37:37.20,00:37:37.20,"take a glance and, you know. I mean, I don't want"
687,00:37:40.33,00:37:40.33,"to tell people what to do, 'cause it's not my job"
688,00:37:42.33,00:37:42.33,to tell people what to do. >> PROBST: Darrah?
689,00:37:44.43,00:37:44.43,">> Um, at the Morgan Tribe, we would sit around"
690,00:37:47.23,00:37:47.23,and joke around and laugh a little bit all day
691,00:37:50.30,00:37:50.30,"and rest. And then, all of a sudden,"
692,00:37:52.00,00:37:52.00,we would all get up and go get firewood at one time
693,00:37:54.50,00:37:54.50,and have enough firewood for two days.
694,00:37:56.50,00:37:56.50,"At the Drake Tribe, it's like,"
695,00:37:58.63,00:37:58.63,you got to have firewood every five minutes.
696,00:38:00.97,00:38:00.97,"I know I have to get firewood, I'll go get firewood."
697,00:38:03.73,00:38:03.73,"You know, I may not get it when she's getting it,"
698,00:38:06.30,00:38:06.30,"but I'll get it eventually, sometime during the day."
699,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,">> PROBST: Rupert, how has it been for you?"
700,00:38:10.37,00:38:10.37,">> To be honest, it is getting harder"
701,00:38:13.90,00:38:13.90,day by day to live together. Everybody in this tribe needs
702,00:38:17.67,00:38:17.67,"to know that they can do better, including me."
703,00:38:20.73,00:38:20.73,"So, when we pick on each other,"
704,00:38:23.00,00:38:23.00,"we need to look at ourselves, too."
705,00:38:24.43,00:38:24.43,">> Burton... you were out of this game,"
706,00:38:27.40,00:38:27.40,"had a chance for some perspective,"
707,00:38:29.20,00:38:29.20,"come back into the game, and now we merge together"
708,00:38:31.60,00:38:31.60,as one tribe. What's your take on the dynamic
709,00:38:33.90,00:38:33.90,"of the nine of you? >> Well, I have to say,"
710,00:38:36.43,00:38:36.43,"when I came back in, the dynamic of the Drake Tribe"
711,00:38:39.23,00:38:39.23,"was better than ever-- my trust with them,"
712,00:38:41.77,00:38:41.77,"their trust with me, and just everyone"
713,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,getting along. There are more Drakes
714,00:38:46.53,00:38:46.53,"than there are Morgans, so that, I think,"
715,00:38:49.30,00:38:49.30,"creates a bit of uneasiness. >> PROBST: Well, from this"
716,00:38:51.93,00:38:51.93,"point forward, the voting has a different significance,"
717,00:38:56.13,00:38:56.13,"because you are now the jury, seven of you,"
718,00:38:58.70,00:38:58.70,"so when you vote somebody out, you're voting somebody out,"
719,00:39:01.30,00:39:01.30,"who is, in the end, going to sit across from you"
720,00:39:04.27,00:39:04.27,and determine which of the final two
721,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,gets a million dollars. Rupert is the only person
722,00:39:08.10,00:39:08.10,you cannot vote for. Everybody else is fair game.
723,00:39:10.67,00:39:10.67,"Having said that, it is time to vote-- Sandra,"
724,00:39:13.07,00:39:13.07,you're up. >> I'm sorry we weren't
725,00:39:27.77,00:39:27.77,on the same team. I know you would have been
726,00:39:31.83,00:39:31.83,good with me. I would trade you
727,00:39:33.97,00:39:33.97,"for a bunch of my guys, but it's your time to go."
728,00:39:50.10,00:39:50.10,"Hey, Christa, I didn't like you before, don't like you now."
729,00:39:53.23,00:39:53.23,"You're just, plain and simply, a bitch."
730,00:40:14.60,00:40:14.60,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
731,00:40:18.93,00:40:18.93,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: Once the votes are

733,00:40:32.93,00:40:32.93,will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
734,00:40:35.53,00:40:35.53,immediately. I'll read the votes.
735,00:40:42.80,00:40:42.80,Ryan. Christa.
736,00:40:53.93,00:40:53.93,Ryno. That's two votes Ryno.
737,00:40:59.57,00:40:59.57,"Ryno, that's three votes."
738,00:41:05.33,00:41:05.33,"Ryno, that's four. Eighth person voted"
739,00:41:10.57,00:41:10.57,out of the tribe: Ryan. You need to
740,00:41:12.93,00:41:12.93,"bring me your torch. That's five notes,"
741,00:41:14.80,00:41:14.80,that's enough. The rest will remain a mystery.
742,00:41:20.50,00:41:20.50,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken. >> I'll be back, guys."
743,00:41:38.03,00:41:38.03,>> PROBST: Tribal Council is where you are held accountable

748,00:41:49.70,00:41:49.70,will come into play. You just voted out
