369,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,And then we'd still beus five girls.
370,00:21:42.17,00:21:42.17,>> Maybe the girls are thebetter people to keep around.
371,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,We got to orchestrate this well.>> Me and Christa definitely do
372,00:21:49.07,00:21:49.07,"feel vulnerable,because Burton and Rupert"
373,00:21:52.37,00:21:52.37,are the only onesthat bring anything
374,00:21:54.53,00:21:54.53,"from in the ocean to us to eat--fish, stingray, whatever."
375,00:22:01.80,00:22:01.80,">> All right, girls.let's go find us a meal,"
376,00:22:05.30,00:22:05.30,"so we can survive, maybe,on this island without any men."
