1,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:02.97,00:00:02.97, Chuay Gahn speculated about a possible merge.
3,00:00:06.03,00:00:06.03,TED:I have a feeling it's going
4,00:00:07.27,00:00:07.27,to happenin the next three days.
5,00:00:08.67,00:00:08.67,"It could,I wouldn't be surprised."
6,00:00:10.30,00:00:10.30,PROBST: Robb was upset when Ken told him that Penny
7,00:00:12.70,00:00:12.70,was thinking of voting him out.
8,00:00:14.43,00:00:14.43,"PENNY: I said absolutely not, 100%"
9,00:00:16.40,00:00:16.40,never was I going to writeyour name down last night.
10,00:00:18.80,00:00:18.80,"PROBST: Believing Penny, Robb confronted Ken."
11,00:00:21.30,00:00:21.30,Trust is instilled early.
12,00:00:22.70,00:00:22.70,I'm the only personthat's been straight with you
13,00:00:24.20,00:00:24.20,and you just bit the ... handthat's been trying to feed you.
14,00:00:27.17,00:00:27.17,PROBST: Robb's mood didn't get any better
15,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83, when the tribe objected
16,00:00:30.20,00:00:30.20, to his helping himself to their bananas.
17,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27,I'm not trying to squabbleabout bananas.
18,00:00:33.63,00:00:33.63,"-We're just trying to...-All right, well, then, shut up."
19,00:00:35.47,00:00:35.47,"PROBST: When Shii Ann tried to intervene, Penny got annoyed."
20,00:00:38.20,00:00:38.20,"PENNY: I said, ""Shii Ann, stay out of it."
21,00:00:40.17,00:00:40.17," We don't need you involved."""
22,00:00:41.87,00:00:41.87,"PROBST: At the reward challenge,"
23,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07, Robb redeemed himself by securing the Sook Jai victory.
24,00:00:46.63,00:00:46.63,"-Oh, awesome.-Gonna eat tonight."
25,00:00:47.80,00:00:47.80,PROBST:The tribe enjoyed a Thai feast.
26,00:00:49.77,00:00:49.77,We were fighting over bananas.
27,00:00:51.33,00:00:51.33,"We love you, Robb."
28,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,PROBST: But it was Chuay Gahn that won
29,00:00:54.80,00:00:54.80," the all-important immunity,"
30,00:00:56.13,00:00:56.13," sending Sook Jai to Tribal Council,"
31,00:00:59.27,00:00:59.27,"and although he made peace withhis tribe, Robb was voted out."
32,00:01:02.67,00:01:02.67,-You guys are all with me.-(Ken murmurs indistinctly)
33,00:01:05.87,00:01:05.87,The tribe has spoken.
34,00:01:06.93,00:01:06.93,"Thanks, bro."
35,00:01:08.37,00:01:08.37,PROBST: Ten are left.
36,00:01:09.47,00:01:09.47," Tonight, one more will go."
37,00:02:21.67,00:02:21.67,"ERIN:  This is, by far,"
38,00:02:23.00,00:02:23.00, one of the hardest things I've ever done.
39,00:02:24.73,00:02:24.73, You've made bonds with these people
40,00:02:26.07,00:02:26.07," and you do feel badwhen you have to vote them out,"
41,00:02:28.17,00:02:28.17, because they are your family for right now.
42,00:02:30.30,00:02:30.30,Who feels good about that one?
43,00:02:32.93,00:02:32.93,And you know what?
44,00:02:34.87,00:02:34.87,It's going to getharder and harder.
45,00:02:37.30,00:02:37.30,"ERIN: But I don't necessarily feel completely,"
46,00:02:40.30,00:02:40.30,"uh, confident withany single person in the tribe."
47,00:02:43.40,00:02:43.40,I don't get itwith him and Shii Ann.
48,00:02:46.83,00:02:46.83,I don't either.
49,00:02:48.20,00:02:48.20,They may already havean alliance already.
50,00:02:50.17,00:02:50.17,Mm-hmm.
51,00:02:51.60,00:02:51.60,ERIN: So I am kind of maybe keeping an eye on Ken
52,00:02:53.87,00:02:53.87,and keeping an eye on Shii Ann.
53,00:02:56.80,00:02:56.80,I think those two areprobably th-th-the two
54,00:02:58.83,00:02:58.83,that I might keep my eye onthe most at this point.
55,00:03:02.27,00:03:02.27,KEN: I told Robbthe truth from square one...
56,00:03:03.63,00:03:03.63,-SHII ANN: Yeah. -...abouteverything he ever asked me.
57,00:03:05.03,00:03:05.03,"That day,remember when he, like,"
58,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,started fighting with me?
59,00:03:08.13,00:03:08.13,Yeah.
60,00:03:09.27,00:03:09.27,That day Penny told himthat I was lying to him.
61,00:03:12.80,00:03:12.80,"Just 'cause she said it,he-he got all pissy,"
62,00:03:14.93,00:03:14.93,and he started fighting with me.
63,00:03:16.47,00:03:16.47,"SHII ANN: I think it's really,like, kind of messed up"
64,00:03:19.20,00:03:19.20,that Penny keeps doing that.
65,00:03:20.37,00:03:20.37,"KEN:Yeah, well, look,"
66,00:03:21.63,00:03:21.63,"she's playing the game, too."
67,00:03:22.80,00:03:22.80,She's playing hard.
68,00:03:24.03,00:03:24.03,"She's playing hardball, dude."
69,00:03:25.37,00:03:25.37,"She... but she,yeah, she's playing like, uh..."
70,00:03:27.43,00:03:27.43,"-Hardball, seriously.-She's playing like sneaky."
71,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,She's so sneaky about it.
72,00:03:30.67,00:03:30.67,KEN: I'm watching Penny because she's sneaky.
73,00:03:33.37,00:03:33.37,"I know her MO,her method of operation."
74,00:03:35.37,00:03:35.37,I can see it.It's all over her.
75,00:03:37.13,00:03:37.13,I can just picture herin high school.
76,00:03:38.97,00:03:38.97,I know how she waswhen she was in high school.
77,00:03:41.30,00:03:41.30, I see how she operates.
78,00:03:43.27,00:03:43.27,I think she wantsto vote me out right now. Oh.
79,00:03:45.97,00:03:45.97,She's been... She's beenafter you all... since day one.
80,00:03:48.37,00:03:48.37,"Oh, she's been after me forever."
81,00:03:49.77,00:03:49.77,SHII ANN: Ken was pretty upset about Penny's
82,00:03:52.37,00:03:52.37,"manipulative ways,even though he knows"
83,00:03:53.97,00:03:53.97,that that's the way she is.
84,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67, He doesn't like it when the table turned.
85,00:03:57.33,00:03:57.33," Going into a merge,  he's strong,"
86,00:03:59.33,00:03:59.33, he's going to be a huge target.
87,00:04:01.00,00:04:01.00,"All right, dude,I'm going to bed."
88,00:04:02.57,00:04:02.57,"All right, good night."
89,00:04:03.87,00:04:03.87,"Good night, baby."
90,00:04:05.37,00:04:05.37,I'll talk to you tomorrow.
91,00:04:06.63,00:04:06.63,I'll see you tomorrow.

93,00:04:25.20,00:04:25.20,Let me read this.
94,00:04:26.53,00:04:26.53,"""A different color per person,"
95,00:04:28.50,00:04:28.50,"""adorn yourselves well."
96,00:04:30.20,00:04:30.20,"""Show some personality,'cause you can never tell."
97,00:04:33.33,00:04:33.33,"""Use only one color."
98,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,"""Don't share with a friend."

100,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,"It will pay off in the end."""
101,00:04:40.03,00:04:40.03,And let's see what these are.
102,00:04:41.67,00:04:41.67,-Looks like little... probablylittle finger paints. -Ooh.
103,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63,"KEN: You got blue,I'll take blue."
104,00:04:45.63,00:04:45.63,"SHII ANN: We got treemail with paints, and we were told"
105,00:04:48.10,00:04:48.10, to pick a color and to start painting ourselves.
106,00:04:49.97,00:04:49.97, And we didn't really know
107,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,what it was for; we figured
108,00:04:52.57,00:04:52.57,"it had somethingto do with a merge,"
109,00:04:54.47,00:04:54.47,but we didn't really know.
110,00:04:55.83,00:04:55.83,"Body paint, huh?"
111,00:04:57.77,00:04:57.77,"TED:Hey, it's body paint stuff!"
112,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"Ooh, I like that one!"

117,00:05:06.80,00:05:06.80,"-Ooh. -Come on,let's all show some personality."

120,00:05:41.80,00:05:41.80,and political feat that sixof your other tribe mates
121,00:05:44.17,00:05:44.17,were unable to accomplish.
122,00:05:46.47,00:05:46.47,We thought it might be funthis morning
123,00:05:48.30,00:05:48.30,to give you guys a chance
124,00:05:49.70,00:05:49.70,to get to know someonefrom the other tribe;
125,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37,"spend a little quality time,one-on-one."
126,00:05:54.87,00:05:54.87,Five different colored paintswere sent over to each beach.
127,00:05:57.97,00:05:57.97,"You guys eachrandomly selected one,"
128,00:06:01.37,00:06:01.37,"and in doing so, you matchedyourselves up with somebody"
129,00:06:03.83,00:06:03.83,from the other tribe.
130,00:06:05.63,00:06:05.63,"As I call out the pairs,I want you two"
131,00:06:07.37,00:06:07.37,to meet in the middleand randomly select one basket.
132,00:06:11.33,00:06:11.33,Two of these baskets containfurther instructions.
133,00:06:14.20,00:06:14.20,"And then find a nice, quiet,"
134,00:06:16.83,00:06:16.83,"secluded spot on the beach,"
135,00:06:18.13,00:06:18.13,and start gettingto know each other.
136,00:06:19.97,00:06:19.97,-All right.-All right.
137,00:06:21.13,00:06:21.13,Let's start with you guys.
138,00:06:22.43,00:06:22.43,"JAN: And so, Jeff"
139,00:06:23.67,00:06:23.67,"called out the color,"
140,00:06:24.87,00:06:24.87,and the people gotwith the person
141,00:06:26.47,00:06:26.47,that had the same body paint.
142,00:06:27.83,00:06:27.83," So, Clay and Shii Ann got the same."
143,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43, Penny and Brian ended up with the same color.
144,00:06:34.57,00:06:34.57, Erin and Teddy got the same color.
145,00:06:37.47,00:06:37.47, Helen and Ken ended up the same color.
146,00:06:41.77,00:06:41.77," And,"
147,00:06:42.93,00:06:42.93,"as luck would have it,"
148,00:06:44.17,00:06:44.17,"Jake and I ended upthe same thing,"
149,00:06:46.10,00:06:46.10," so that was real funny, 'cause we were the original"
150,00:06:48.23,00:06:48.23,ones to have picked the tribes.
151,00:06:51.77,00:06:51.77,Let's go!

598,00:23:38.17,00:23:38.17, that I was gonna vote for Penny.

600,00:23:41.87,00:23:41.87,"it would bethe right thing to do,"
601,00:23:43.73,00:23:43.73,to let them know thatI'm not voting with them.
602,00:23:45.90,00:23:45.90,"But, at the same time,"
603,00:23:47.33,00:23:47.33, I'm not sure that it would be wise to do that.
604,00:23:50.70,00:23:50.70,Did you figure outwhat you're gonna do?
605,00:23:52.73,00:23:52.73,"Yeah, I think I'mgonna go with my, uh..."

607,00:24:03.27,00:24:03.27,I'm very... I'm flip-flopping.
608,00:24:05.10,00:24:05.10,"Well, I just need to knowwhat you're gonna do."
609,00:24:07.13,00:24:07.13,"I mean, everybody saidyou were gonna do this,"
610,00:24:09.10,00:24:09.10,"and I defended you,saying you weren't."
611,00:24:10.77,00:24:10.77,And then you're doing it.
612,00:24:12.17,00:24:12.17, I had a conversation with Shii Ann.
613,00:24:13.87,00:24:13.87," I-I... hey, look, if she does, like,"
614,00:24:16.90,00:24:16.90,"turn on the wholevoting strategy,"
615,00:24:19.03,00:24:19.03,"for the rest of her life,she'll be considered a rat."
616,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,"I don't know whatI'm gonna do, exactly."
617,00:24:24.90,00:24:24.90,"Like, can youat least let me know"
618,00:24:27.23,00:24:27.23,which way... if you're...if you're going with their side
619,00:24:29.80,00:24:29.80,or staying on our side?
620,00:24:31.13,00:24:31.13,I'm staying onyou and Jake's side.
621,00:24:32.90,00:24:32.90,"Well, that'swhat I'm talking about."
622,00:24:34.40,00:24:34.40,But I'm not stayingon Penny and Erin's side.
623,00:24:36.87,00:24:36.87,Penny's the one that got to go.
624,00:24:38.13,00:24:38.13,"I've talked about itwith Brian, too."
625,00:24:39.87,00:24:39.87,She's going-- just not yet.
626,00:24:41.67,00:24:41.67,"Let us get an advantage first,then we'll take out Penny."
627,00:24:44.70,00:24:44.70,We're gonna do that next.
628,00:24:46.13,00:24:46.13," In fact, we're even-numbered here, five and five."
629,00:24:48.63,00:24:48.63,"Now you're gonna give theman advantage, thinking,"

631,00:24:53.73,00:24:53.73,"a little snake, now they'regonna, like, invite you in?"
632,00:24:56.40,00:24:56.40,That shows disloyaltyfrom the beginning.
633,00:24:58.87,00:24:58.87,"She's making herself an outcaston both sides, at this point."
634,00:25:01.07,00:25:01.07,I knowyou're pissed off at Penny
635,00:25:02.47,00:25:02.47,and you want to get rid of her
636,00:25:04.03,00:25:04.03,"and you don't want herto make the jury,"
637,00:25:05.83,00:25:05.83,"but don't sinkeverybody else and yourself,"
638,00:25:08.10,00:25:08.10,because you're pissed offat one person.
639,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,And that's what you're doing.
640,00:25:11.67,00:25:11.67,So just think about itand let me know what's going on.

797,00:33:00.37,00:33:00.37,"Sook Jai, don't quit."
798,00:33:03.17,00:33:03.17,Three members outfor Chuay Gahn.
799,00:33:08.70,00:33:08.70,"Come on, Clay!"
800,00:33:09.83,00:33:09.83,"-Wait, wait, wait, wait!-(Ted grunting)"
801,00:33:12.40,00:33:12.40,(Ted continues grunting)
802,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,Let's go! Here we go!
803,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13,PROBST:Let me see those keys.
804,00:33:21.97,00:33:21.97,Fifteen.Chuay Gahn wins immunity!
805,00:33:25.33,00:33:25.33,Yeah!
806,00:33:32.03,00:33:32.03,Chuay Gahn has immunity.
807,00:33:33.30,00:33:33.30,-Yay! -You guys are safethree more days.
808,00:33:35.33,00:33:35.33,"Sook Jai, nice effort, guys."
809,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,"Unfortunately, not enough."
810,00:33:39.80,00:33:39.80,You know what this means--Tribal Council.
811,00:33:41.90,00:33:41.90,Somebody's going home tonight.
812,00:33:43.63,00:33:43.63,You guys need to headstraight over there.
813,00:33:45.70,00:33:45.70,We'll see you there shortly.
814,00:34:10.57,00:34:10.57,CLAY: I'm gonna tell y'all what that was like.
815,00:34:13.57,00:34:13.57,"That was like goingto Thanksgiving dinner,"
816,00:34:15.57,00:34:15.57,"and somebody just slappedthe ... out of Grandma,"
817,00:34:17.80,00:34:17.80,and both families splitand started fighting again.
818,00:34:20.10,00:34:20.10,"JAN (laughs): Well, we had"
819,00:34:22.50,00:34:22.50," another challenge, but it was a trick."
820,00:34:25.67,00:34:25.67,We thought it wasa merge of the two tribes.
821,00:34:29.30,00:34:29.30,"And, of course, when wegot there, to our surprise,"
822,00:34:32.53,00:34:32.53,"it was not a merge,"
823,00:34:34.00,00:34:34.00," we are still two tribes,"
824,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80," vying for, uh, immunity."
825,00:34:38.60,00:34:38.60,"-They're gone. -Yeah, they'reat Tribal Council, y'all."
826,00:34:40.70,00:34:40.70,They're not getting a break.They there.
827,00:34:42.97,00:34:42.97,TED:After today...
828,00:34:44.50,00:34:44.50,"-CLAY: Anything.-...anything, I mean,"
829,00:34:46.77,00:34:46.77,now we got a situation wherewe're sleeping with the enemy.
830,00:35:06.60,00:35:06.60,PROBST:Welcome to Tribal Council.
831,00:35:11.20,00:35:11.20,"So, tonight, a very big vote."
832,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,"If you survive tonight's vote,you are in this game,"
833,00:35:16.90,00:35:16.90,"one way or another,until the end,"
834,00:35:18.53,00:35:18.53,"because, at the very least,you'll be a member of the jury"
835,00:35:21.20,00:35:21.20,"and have a big impact on who,ultimately, wins this game."
836,00:35:24.83,00:35:24.83,"All right, so,"
837,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27,"you get to the beach,everything's great."
838,00:35:28.87,00:35:28.87,You start assuming that we'remerging and that it's gonna be
839,00:35:31.23,00:35:31.23,an individual challenge.
840,00:35:32.30,00:35:32.30,"You show up and you find out,"
841,00:35:34.03,00:35:34.03,"no, it's still tribal. Erin,"
842,00:35:36.30,00:35:36.30,"what's your reaction,at that point,"
843,00:35:37.83,00:35:37.83,"as you're sitting there,listening to me explain"
844,00:35:39.87,00:35:39.87,that it's tribe versus tribe?
845,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,"ERIN:I was in complete shock,"
846,00:35:43.80,00:35:43.80,because I thoughtthat we were gonna go to...
847,00:35:47.37,00:35:47.37,"an immunity challengefor individuals,"
848,00:35:50.37,00:35:50.37,we were gonna get new buffs
849,00:35:51.80,00:35:51.80,and that we all had mergedinto one tribe.
850,00:35:54.07,00:35:54.07,That's how we've been livingfor the past couple days.
851,00:35:55.83,00:35:55.83,So I'm still in shock thatwe're two separate tribes.
852,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,"PROBST: Well, we'regetting a lot of weather,"
853,00:36:00.97,00:36:00.97,"the wind's blowing through here,now the rain is"
854,00:36:03.03,00:36:03.03,starting to come down outside.
855,00:36:04.57,00:36:04.57,Sort of a fitting endto a turbulent three days.
856,00:36:07.80,00:36:07.80,(Shii Ann gasps)
857,00:36:10.20,00:36:10.20,"Nice catch, Jake."
858,00:36:11.50,00:36:11.50,"JAKE:Thanks, I'd hate to lose this."
859,00:36:13.33,00:36:13.33,"PROBST:Jake,"
860,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,how does this impact the game?
861,00:36:17.50,00:36:17.50,"Clearly, you guys were workingtoward the thought"
862,00:36:20.13,00:36:20.13,that this would become a mergeand an individual game.
863,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,"We're gonna bedown to four tonight,"
864,00:36:26.57,00:36:26.57,and they're gonna be at five.
865,00:36:27.87,00:36:27.87,So what we're gonna haveto do now is just
866,00:36:29.93,00:36:29.93,reorganize our thoughtsand go back in
867,00:36:32.40,00:36:32.40,"with some adaptable ideas,"
868,00:36:34.30,00:36:34.30,and see where we're going.
869,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,"Erin, you reckon"
870,00:36:36.83,00:36:36.83,there's been someinformation shared
871,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,in the last two and a half days
872,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,that people might beregretting a little bit?
873,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,I feel that there may be alittle bit of information shared
874,00:36:46.40,00:36:46.40,in the past couple days.
875,00:36:47.73,00:36:47.73,I have already found out
876,00:36:49.07,00:36:49.07,"that some people weren'tbeing true to our tribe,"
877,00:36:52.30,00:36:52.30,and were kind oftrying to win over some
878,00:36:54.70,00:36:54.70,"of the other Chuay Gahn members,thinking it was a merge."
879,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,"And it is, um...kind of disheartening,"
880,00:37:00.13,00:37:00.13,"thinking that,you know, your tribe,"
881,00:37:02.13,00:37:02.13,"that you thought you trusted,"
882,00:37:03.30,00:37:03.30,now is startingto really look out
883,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,for themselves ratherthan for their entire tribe.
884,00:37:08.00,00:37:08.00,"PROBST:Penny, how do you"
885,00:37:09.53,00:37:09.53,figure out howyou're gonna vote?
886,00:37:11.53,00:37:11.53,Because certainly there'ssome strategy in this.
887,00:37:13.40,00:37:13.40,"PENNY:There is strategy in this,"
888,00:37:15.47,00:37:15.47,but it's more sokind of information
889,00:37:17.53,00:37:17.53,"that was broughtto my attention,"
890,00:37:19.40,00:37:19.40,saying that oneof my tribe members
891,00:37:21.27,00:37:21.27,has said thatI'm the next to go.
892,00:37:24.10,00:37:24.10,"So, you talk about trust,"
893,00:37:26.13,00:37:26.13,and I've hadto trust these people
894,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,for 18 days.
895,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,"Well, the last 24 hours,I'm thinking,"
896,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,who can I not trust?
897,00:37:32.37,00:37:32.37,"Well, guys, this isalways an open forum."
898,00:37:35.80,00:37:35.80,"-Good. -You haven't hada chance to talk until now,"
899,00:37:38.47,00:37:38.47,"but clearly, there'sstuff going on-- I can sense it,"
900,00:37:41.03,00:37:41.03,-and I can see Shii Ann.-I'd like... I'd love to speak.
901,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,Hey.
902,00:37:44.77,00:37:44.77,This is not a tribe unified.
903,00:37:46.47,00:37:46.47,It's never been a tribe unified.
904,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,As much as everyone herewould like to think
905,00:37:50.40,00:37:50.40,"it was a tribe unified,this has not been the case."
906,00:37:53.67,00:37:53.67,And I've been the brunt.
907,00:37:55.40,00:37:55.40,I've been the person who feltthat the most the entire time.
908,00:37:58.90,00:37:58.90,So is it surprising for meto go to Chuay Gahn
909,00:38:01.60,00:38:01.60,"and find five peoplewho are really lovely,"
910,00:38:04.03,00:38:04.03,who I can talk tofor the first time
911,00:38:06.80,00:38:06.80,and realize that the peoplewho mistreated me at Sook Jai
912,00:38:11.53,00:38:11.53,are also the people whoChuay Gahn distrusts the most.
913,00:38:15.70,00:38:15.70,"You don't think theyasked about you, Ken?"
914,00:38:17.50,00:38:17.50,You were the first personthey asked about.
915,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,And I watch your back.
916,00:38:21.60,00:38:21.60,"Jake, same thing."
917,00:38:23.93,00:38:23.93,You know that I'vealways been loyal to you.
918,00:38:27.97,00:38:27.97,"Penny, you're manipulativebecause I know you don't..."
919,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,"I know that that'snot a pleasant word,"
920,00:38:34.47,00:38:34.47,but it's the way thatyou've played the game.
921,00:38:36.73,00:38:36.73,"If we go back today and I'm out,and not Penny,"
922,00:38:40.77,00:38:40.77,that's gonna leave anotherimpression with those guys.
923,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,"Penny, what'syour take on all this?"
924,00:38:45.70,00:38:45.70,I've had plenty of opportunityto vote Shii Ann out
925,00:38:49.13,00:38:49.13,"if I wanted to,and I chose not to."
926,00:38:51.87,00:38:51.87,'Cause I told herthat the five of us
927,00:38:54.20,00:38:54.20,should go in strong.
928,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43,I don't feel likeI've been manipulative.
929,00:38:57.73,00:38:57.73,"And, you know, bottom line is,"
930,00:38:59.73,00:38:59.73,is we're still Sook Jai.
931,00:39:01.20,00:39:01.20,We are still Sook Jai.
932,00:39:03.00,00:39:03.00,"No matter what Chuay Gahnthinks or says,"
933,00:39:05.87,00:39:05.87,these are the peoplethat I need to be with.
934,00:39:08.70,00:39:08.70,And these are the onesthat I'm concerned with.
935,00:39:10.67,00:39:10.67,I'm not concerned with them.
936,00:39:11.90,00:39:11.90,"So, Shii Ann, what isthe plea you're making?"
937,00:39:13.47,00:39:13.47,"Are you making an offer?Are you saying,"
938,00:39:15.47,00:39:15.47,here's what we should do?
939,00:39:16.90,00:39:16.90,"SHII ANN:What I'm saying is,"
940,00:39:18.90,00:39:18.90,"Jake, Ken, Erin,"
941,00:39:20.60,00:39:20.60,I know that you're thinkingabout voting me off.
942,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,"I mean honestly, today,I didn't make any decisions."
943,00:39:27.27,00:39:27.27,I told you that I wouldcome up and tell you.
944,00:39:29.77,00:39:29.77,I have not lied to you yet.
945,00:39:32.20,00:39:32.20,I have not come up to you
946,00:39:34.63,00:39:34.63,and tried to backstabsomeone else yet.
947,00:39:36.83,00:39:36.83,You got to lookat the whole 18 days.
948,00:39:38.77,00:39:38.77,You can't just lookat what happened today.
949,00:39:41.63,00:39:41.63,"And I'm sayingdon't vote me out,"
950,00:39:44.30,00:39:44.30,"because I've... promisedto be on your sides,"
951,00:39:48.10,00:39:48.10,"and I still maintainthat promise,"
952,00:39:50.73,00:39:50.73,"and when we go back to tribe,"
953,00:39:53.47,00:39:53.47,"if I'm with you guys,"
954,00:39:55.13,00:39:55.13,I think I know moreintimately how...
955,00:39:57.13,00:39:57.13,"where their heads arethan any of you,"
956,00:39:59.63,00:39:59.63,and that's gonna come in handy.
957,00:40:01.47,00:40:01.47,"PROBST:Well, clearly, there is"
958,00:40:03.00,00:40:03.00,a bit of a cloud hanging overthis tribe at the moment.
959,00:40:05.97,00:40:05.97,The big question now is:How will that new information
960,00:40:09.30,00:40:09.30,impact tonight's vote?
961,00:40:10.67,00:40:10.67,"It is time to find out,because it's time to vote."
962,00:40:13.53,00:40:13.53,"Shii Ann, you're first."
963,00:40:42.13,00:40:42.13,"Tonight, I'm votingfor Shii Ann."
964,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17, It's obvious that you broke alliances
965,00:40:46.77,00:40:46.77,"and all I have to say is,what comes around goes around."
966,00:41:08.03,00:41:08.03,I'll go tally the votes.
967,00:41:20.40,00:41:20.40,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
968,00:41:23.13,00:41:23.13,Person voted outwill be asked to leave
969,00:41:24.97,00:41:24.97,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
970,00:41:26.23,00:41:26.23,I'll read the votes.
971,00:41:31.43,00:41:31.43,First vote...
972,00:41:33.83,00:41:33.83,Shii Ann.
973,00:41:37.67,00:41:37.67,Penny.
974,00:41:42.90,00:41:42.90,Shii Ann.
975,00:41:44.27,00:41:44.27,"That's two votes Shii Ann,one vote Penny."
976,00:41:50.30,00:41:50.30,Shii Ann.
977,00:41:52.10,00:41:52.10,You need to bring me your torch.
978,00:42:02.10,00:42:02.10,"Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken."
979,00:42:06.87,00:42:06.87,"Good luck, you guys."
980,00:42:08.53,00:42:08.53,PROBST:It's time for you to go.
981,00:42:26.40,00:42:26.40,"Well, there were a lotof comments made tonight."
982,00:42:29.30,00:42:29.30,This tribe's either gonnarebound and grow stronger
983,00:42:32.03,00:42:32.03,or fracture completely.
984,00:42:33.77,00:42:33.77,"Something to think abouton a long, wet walk home."
985,00:42:36.57,00:42:36.57,You guys can head back to camp.
986,00:42:48.83,00:42:48.83, Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode. 
987,00:42:55.17,00:42:55.17,PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
988,00:42:57.13,00:42:57.13, The tribes adjust to their new living situation.
989,00:42:59.23,00:42:59.23,"BRIAN: You know we're living together, it all looks peachy."
990,00:43:02.43,00:43:02.43,It's us against them.
991,00:43:03.47,00:43:03.47,It smells like under
992,00:43:04.43,00:43:04.43,the boardwalk at Coney Island.
993,00:43:05.43,00:43:05.43, I don't go around pissing
994,00:43:06.43,00:43:06.43," where I sleep, like a Chuay Gahn."
