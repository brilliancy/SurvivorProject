2,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:02.97,00:00:02.97, Chuay Gahn speculated  about a possible merge.
4,00:00:06.03,00:00:06.03,TED: I have a feeling it's going
5,00:00:07.27,00:00:07.27,to happen in the next three days.
6,00:00:08.67,00:00:08.67,"It could, I wouldn't be surprised."
7,00:00:10.30,00:00:10.30,PROBST: Robb was upset  when Ken told him that Penny
8,00:00:12.70,00:00:12.70,was thinking of voting him out.
9,00:00:14.43,00:00:14.43,"PENNY:  I said absolutely not, 100%"
10,00:00:16.40,00:00:16.40,never was I going to write your name down last night.
11,00:00:18.80,00:00:18.80,"PROBST: Believing Penny,  Robb confronted Ken."
12,00:00:21.30,00:00:21.30,Trust is instilled early.
13,00:00:22.70,00:00:22.70,I'm the only person that's been straight with you
14,00:00:24.20,00:00:24.20,and you just bit the ... hand that's been trying to feed you.
15,00:00:27.17,00:00:27.17,PROBST: Robb's mood  didn't get any better
16,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83, when the tribe objected
17,00:00:30.20,00:00:30.20, to his helping himself  to their bananas.
18,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27,I'm not trying to squabble about bananas.
19,00:00:33.63,00:00:33.63,"-We're just trying to... -All right, well, then, shut up."
20,00:00:35.47,00:00:35.47,"PROBST: When Shii Ann tried to  intervene, Penny got annoyed."
21,00:00:38.20,00:00:38.20,"PENNY: I said,  ""Shii Ann, stay out of it."
22,00:00:40.17,00:00:40.17," We don't need you involved."""
23,00:00:41.87,00:00:41.87,"PROBST:  At the reward challenge,"
24,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07, Robb redeemed himself by  securing the Sook Jai victory.
25,00:00:46.63,00:00:46.63,"-Oh, awesome. -Gonna eat tonight."
26,00:00:47.80,00:00:47.80,PROBST: The tribe enjoyed a Thai feast.
27,00:00:49.77,00:00:49.77,We were fighting over bananas.
28,00:00:51.33,00:00:51.33,"We love you, Robb."
29,00:00:53.60,00:00:53.60,PROBST:  But it was Chuay Gahn that won
30,00:00:54.80,00:00:54.80," the all-important immunity,"
31,00:00:56.13,00:00:56.13," sending Sook Jai  to Tribal Council,"
32,00:00:59.27,00:00:59.27,"and although he made peace with his tribe, Robb was voted out."
33,00:01:02.67,00:01:02.67,-You guys are all with me. -(Ken murmurs indistinctly)
34,00:01:05.87,00:01:05.87,The tribe has spoken.
35,00:01:06.93,00:01:06.93,"Thanks, bro."
36,00:01:08.37,00:01:08.37,PROBST:  Ten are left.
37,00:01:09.47,00:01:09.47," Tonight, one more will go."
38,00:02:21.67,00:02:21.67,"ERIN:   This is, by far,"
39,00:02:23.00,00:02:23.00, one of the hardest things  I've ever done.
40,00:02:24.73,00:02:24.73, You've made bonds  with these people
41,00:02:26.07,00:02:26.07," and you do feel bad when you have to vote them out,"
42,00:02:28.17,00:02:28.17, because they are your family  for right now.
43,00:02:30.30,00:02:30.30,Who feels good about that one?
44,00:02:32.93,00:02:32.93,And you know what?
45,00:02:34.87,00:02:34.87,It's going to get harder and harder.
46,00:02:37.30,00:02:37.30,"ERIN: But I don't necessarily  feel completely,"
47,00:02:40.30,00:02:40.30,"uh, confident with any single person in the tribe."
48,00:02:43.40,00:02:43.40,I don't get it with him and Shii Ann.
49,00:02:46.83,00:02:46.83,I don't either.
50,00:02:48.20,00:02:48.20,They may already have an alliance already.
51,00:02:50.17,00:02:50.17,Mm-hmm.
52,00:02:51.60,00:02:51.60,ERIN: So I am kind of maybe  keeping an eye on Ken
53,00:02:53.87,00:02:53.87,and keeping an eye on Shii Ann.
54,00:02:56.80,00:02:56.80,I think those two are probably th-th-the two
55,00:02:58.83,00:02:58.83,that I might keep my eye on the most at this point.
56,00:03:02.27,00:03:02.27,KEN: I told Robb the truth from square one...
57,00:03:03.63,00:03:03.63,-SHII ANN: Yeah. -...about everything he ever asked me.
58,00:03:05.03,00:03:05.03,"That day, remember when he, like,"
59,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,started fighting with me?
60,00:03:08.13,00:03:08.13,Yeah.
61,00:03:09.27,00:03:09.27,That day Penny told him that I was lying to him.
62,00:03:12.80,00:03:12.80,"Just 'cause she said it, he-he got all pissy,"
63,00:03:14.93,00:03:14.93,and he started fighting with me.
64,00:03:16.47,00:03:16.47,"SHII ANN: I think it's really, like, kind of messed up"
65,00:03:19.20,00:03:19.20,that Penny keeps doing that.
66,00:03:20.37,00:03:20.37,"KEN: Yeah, well, look,"
67,00:03:21.63,00:03:21.63,"she's playing the game, too."
68,00:03:22.80,00:03:22.80,She's playing hard.
69,00:03:24.03,00:03:24.03,"She's playing hardball, dude."
70,00:03:25.37,00:03:25.37,"She... but she, yeah, she's playing like, uh..."
71,00:03:27.43,00:03:27.43,"-Hardball, seriously. -She's playing like sneaky."
72,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,She's so sneaky about it.
73,00:03:30.67,00:03:30.67,KEN: I'm watching Penny  because she's sneaky.
74,00:03:33.37,00:03:33.37,"I know her MO, her method of operation."
75,00:03:35.37,00:03:35.37,I can see it. It's all over her.
76,00:03:37.13,00:03:37.13,I can just picture her in high school.
77,00:03:38.97,00:03:38.97,I know how she was when she was in high school.
78,00:03:41.30,00:03:41.30, I see how she operates.
79,00:03:43.27,00:03:43.27,I think she wants to vote me out right now. Oh.
80,00:03:45.97,00:03:45.97,She's been... She's been after you all... since day one.
81,00:03:48.37,00:03:48.37,"Oh, she's been after me forever."
82,00:03:49.77,00:03:49.77,SHII ANN: Ken was pretty upset  about Penny's
83,00:03:52.37,00:03:52.37,"manipulative ways, even though he knows"
84,00:03:53.97,00:03:53.97,that that's the way she is.
85,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67, He doesn't like it  when the table turned.
86,00:03:57.33,00:03:57.33," Going into a merge,   he's strong,"
87,00:03:59.33,00:03:59.33, he's going  to be a huge target.
88,00:04:01.00,00:04:01.00,"All right, dude, I'm going to bed."
89,00:04:02.57,00:04:02.57,"All right, good night."
90,00:04:03.87,00:04:03.87,"Good night, baby."
91,00:04:05.37,00:04:05.37,I'll talk to you tomorrow.
92,00:04:06.63,00:04:06.63,I'll see you tomorrow.
93,00:04:22.93,00:04:22.93,"JAKE: Treemail, guys! Treemail!"
94,00:04:25.20,00:04:25.20,Let me read this.
95,00:04:26.53,00:04:26.53,"""A different color per person,"
96,00:04:28.50,00:04:28.50,"""adorn yourselves well."
97,00:04:30.20,00:04:30.20,"""Show some personality, 'cause you can never tell."
98,00:04:33.33,00:04:33.33,"""Use only one color."
99,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,"""Don't share with a friend."
100,00:04:36.50,00:04:36.50,"""Take pride in your artistry."
101,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,"It will pay off in the end."""
102,00:04:40.03,00:04:40.03,And let's see what these are.
103,00:04:41.67,00:04:41.67,-Looks like little... probably little finger paints. -Ooh.
104,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63,"KEN: You got blue, I'll take blue."
105,00:04:45.63,00:04:45.63,"SHII ANN: We got treemail  with paints, and we were told"
106,00:04:48.10,00:04:48.10, to pick a color and to start  painting ourselves.
107,00:04:49.97,00:04:49.97, And we didn't really know
108,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,what it was for; we figured
109,00:04:52.57,00:04:52.57,"it had something to do with a merge,"
110,00:04:54.47,00:04:54.47,but we didn't really know.
111,00:04:55.83,00:04:55.83,"Body paint, huh?"
112,00:04:57.77,00:04:57.77,"TED: Hey, it's body paint stuff!"
113,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"Ooh, I like that one!"
114,00:05:01.20,00:05:01.20,-TED: Ooh! -HELEN: That's a pretty color.
115,00:05:02.83,00:05:02.83,-JAN: Think about... Oh. -TED: Let's...
116,00:05:04.40,00:05:04.40,-That's gonna look good. -Here we go.
117,00:05:05.63,00:05:05.63,"-Well, let's go. -This looks good."
118,00:05:06.80,00:05:06.80,"-Ooh. -Come on, let's all show some personality."
119,00:05:34.90,00:05:34.90,PROBST: Welcome.
120,00:05:37.60,00:05:37.60,"Congratulations on making it to day 19, a physical"
121,00:05:41.80,00:05:41.80,and political feat that six of your other tribe mates
122,00:05:44.17,00:05:44.17,were unable to accomplish.
123,00:05:46.47,00:05:46.47,We thought it might be fun this morning
124,00:05:48.30,00:05:48.30,to give you guys a chance
125,00:05:49.70,00:05:49.70,to get to know someone from the other tribe;
126,00:05:52.37,00:05:52.37,"spend a little quality time, one-on-one."
127,00:05:54.87,00:05:54.87,Five different colored paints were sent over to each beach.
128,00:05:57.97,00:05:57.97,"You guys each randomly selected one,"
129,00:06:01.37,00:06:01.37,"and in doing so, you matched yourselves up with somebody"
130,00:06:03.83,00:06:03.83,from the other tribe.
131,00:06:05.63,00:06:05.63,"As I call out the pairs, I want you two"
132,00:06:07.37,00:06:07.37,to meet in the middle and randomly select one basket.
133,00:06:11.33,00:06:11.33,Two of these baskets contain further instructions.
134,00:06:14.20,00:06:14.20,"And then find a nice, quiet,"
135,00:06:16.83,00:06:16.83,"secluded spot on the beach,"
136,00:06:18.13,00:06:18.13,and start getting to know each other.
137,00:06:19.97,00:06:19.97,-All right. -All right.
138,00:06:21.13,00:06:21.13,Let's start with you guys.
139,00:06:22.43,00:06:22.43,"JAN:  And so, Jeff"
140,00:06:23.67,00:06:23.67,"called out the color,"
141,00:06:24.87,00:06:24.87,and the people got with the person
142,00:06:26.47,00:06:26.47,that had the same body paint.
143,00:06:27.83,00:06:27.83," So, Clay and Shii Ann  got the same."
144,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43, Penny and Brian ended up  with the same color.
145,00:06:34.57,00:06:34.57, Erin and Teddy  got the same color.
146,00:06:37.47,00:06:37.47, Helen and Ken ended up  the same color.
147,00:06:41.77,00:06:41.77," And,"
148,00:06:42.93,00:06:42.93,"as luck would have it,"
149,00:06:44.17,00:06:44.17,"Jake and I ended up the same thing,"
150,00:06:46.10,00:06:46.10," so that was real funny, 'cause  we were the original"
151,00:06:48.23,00:06:48.23,ones to have picked the tribes.
152,00:06:51.77,00:06:51.77,Let's go!
153,00:06:53.23,00:06:53.23,"-Have fun, guys. -JAN: We will, thanks."
154,00:06:54.67,00:06:54.67,Here we go.
155,00:06:56.03,00:06:56.03,Even holding hands. I like it.
156,00:06:57.67,00:06:57.67,JAN: Absolutely!
157,00:07:00.23,00:07:00.23,"BRIAN: You want to see what's in our, uh, basket?"
158,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,PENNY: Are we allowed to open it up?
159,00:07:04.03,00:07:04.03,I think so.
160,00:07:06.03,00:07:06.03,"-Oh, wow! -(Brian mutters)"
161,00:07:07.27,00:07:07.27,We got some fruit.
162,00:07:08.77,00:07:08.77,"BRIAN:  We had a picnic on the beach,"
163,00:07:10.73,00:07:10.73,"found out a little about each other, found out a little bit"
164,00:07:12.77,00:07:12.77,"about the tribe, found out how they were living."
165,00:07:14.30,00:07:14.30,We did a lot of oysters and snails in the beginning.
166,00:07:17.10,00:07:17.10,Isn't it a pain to clean them and do all that stuff?
167,00:07:19.00,00:07:19.00,Uh-huh. Boil 'em and...
168,00:07:20.17,00:07:20.17,"Oh, what's in our basket?"
169,00:07:21.87,00:07:21.87,I don't know.
170,00:07:23.40,00:07:23.40,"-Oh, wow! -Wow."
171,00:07:25.23,00:07:25.23,-Hey! What's this? -What the heck is that?
172,00:07:27.17,00:07:27.17,Open it up.
173,00:07:28.67,00:07:28.67,"SHII ANN:  ""Getting to know you, getting"

177,00:07:37.30,00:07:37.30,"to pick up the basket that had another note in it,"

180,00:07:43.53,00:07:43.53,says go look at the other tribe's camp.
181,00:07:45.17,00:07:45.17,And what's our little message?
182,00:07:48.73,00:07:48.73,CLAY: Home-- we are home over here.
183,00:07:50.40,00:07:50.40,SHII ANN: You got a home in the cave?
184,00:07:51.93,00:07:51.93,That's so wonderful!
185,00:07:52.73,00:07:52.73,CLAY: The bats in there
186,00:07:53.80,00:07:53.80,fly off in the early afternoon.
187,00:07:55.10,00:07:55.10,That's nice. We had...
188,00:07:56.50,00:07:56.50,-We had a rooster waking us up for a while. -Really?
189,00:07:58.63,00:07:58.63,SHII ANN: But we ate him.
190,00:07:59.87,00:07:59.87,"-CLAY: Now, we got monkeys everywhere. -Oh, you do?"
191,00:08:01.27,00:08:01.27,-You ain't seen a monkey? -No.
192,00:08:02.60,00:08:02.60,-Haven't seen too many. -We got one named Magilla.
193,00:08:04.57,00:08:04.57,-Magilla? -That's what we named our monkey.
194,00:08:05.83,00:08:05.83,"Oh, that's great."
195,00:08:07.07,00:08:07.07,This is home. That's our bed back there.
196,00:08:08.70,00:08:08.70,Wow. This is great!
197,00:08:10.10,00:08:10.10,"-This is much better than our shelter, I think. -Really?"
198,00:08:15.83,00:08:15.83,-Wow. This is your bed? -Yeah.
199,00:08:17.33,00:08:17.33,"-Did you guys build this? -Yes, we did."
200,00:08:19.37,00:08:19.37,"Oh, my God, where did you get chickens?"
201,00:08:22.47,00:08:22.47,-Have you eaten one? -Yeah.

207,00:08:33.53,00:08:33.53,-Cheers. -Yeah. Cheers.
208,00:08:35.00,00:08:35.00,"HELEN: And then the second  thing, of course, was:"

213,00:08:45.23,00:08:45.23,"Same type of water hole, but like I said,"
214,00:08:46.93,00:08:46.93,you got to swim at least a mile to it.

239,00:09:39.03,00:09:39.03,"I don't know, it was, like, because I had been so pent up"
240,00:09:42.77,00:09:42.77,"for 18 days, I just spilled my guts."
241,00:09:44.83,00:09:44.83,"I'll tell you right now, what they're saying,"

249,00:10:01.60,00:10:01.60,"SHII ANN: And if Ken wasn't around, I wouldn't be here."
250,00:10:03.87,00:10:03.87,"Ken is the person who was like, ""You know what? That's not fair."

252,00:10:08.40,00:10:08.40,"And Penny, who, by the way, as sweet as she looks, she is..."

254,00:10:12.90,00:10:12.90,"I'll tell you, she is the most manipulative player on our team."
255,00:10:16.67,00:10:16.67, So I gave him the down-low on  what was going on at Sook Jai
256,00:10:19.97,00:10:19.97," and all the crap  that I had to endure,"
257,00:10:22.07,00:10:22.07,"and... and, uh, I found him to be very sympathetic."

259,00:10:27.23,00:10:27.23,"we could get Jake on the older side,"

413,00:16:06.63,00:16:06.63,I think that has a little bit to do with it.
414,00:16:08.43,00:16:08.43,"-Yeah, mm-hmm. -I mean, you can't take it out."
415,00:16:09.97,00:16:09.97,"I mean, I don't think it's because people are racist."
416,00:16:11.83,00:16:11.83,-Mm-hmm. -It's just that people don't understand.

591,00:23:04.90,00:23:04.90,I told them to their face that I'm on board.
592,00:23:07.27,00:23:07.27, I'm working a deal;  I'm voting Penny out.
593,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,"I mean, Shii Ann, Shii Ann..."
594,00:23:10.80,00:23:10.80,"Oh, I think there's something on me."
595,00:23:11.87,00:23:11.87,...let's have fun; this is gonna be a blast.
596,00:23:13.97,00:23:13.97,I know it's gonna be a blast. I'm having a great time.
597,00:23:16.70,00:23:16.70,You know I'm having a great time.
598,00:23:36.33,00:23:36.33,SHII ANN:   I have not firmly said
599,00:23:38.17,00:23:38.17, that I was gonna  vote for Penny.
600,00:23:39.70,00:23:39.70," I've talked to Ken about it,  but I feel like"
601,00:23:41.87,00:23:41.87,"it would be the right thing to do,"
602,00:23:43.73,00:23:43.73,to let them know that I'm not voting with them.
603,00:23:45.90,00:23:45.90,"But, at the same time,"
604,00:23:47.33,00:23:47.33, I'm not sure that  it would be wise to do that.
605,00:23:50.70,00:23:50.70,Did you figure out what you're gonna do?
606,00:23:52.73,00:23:52.73,"Yeah, I think I'm gonna go with my, uh..."
607,00:23:57.40,00:23:57.40,...think I'm gonna go...
608,00:24:03.27,00:24:03.27,I'm very... I'm flip-flopping.
609,00:24:05.10,00:24:05.10,"Well, I just need to know what you're gonna do."
610,00:24:07.13,00:24:07.13,"I mean, everybody said you were gonna do this,"
611,00:24:09.10,00:24:09.10,"and I defended you, saying you weren't."
612,00:24:10.77,00:24:10.77,And then you're doing it.
613,00:24:12.17,00:24:12.17, I had a conversation  with Shii Ann.
614,00:24:13.87,00:24:13.87," I-I... hey, look,  if she does, like,"
615,00:24:16.90,00:24:16.90,"turn on the whole voting strategy,"
616,00:24:19.03,00:24:19.03,"for the rest of her life, she'll be considered a rat."
617,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,"I don't know what I'm gonna do, exactly."
618,00:24:24.90,00:24:24.90,"Like, can you at least let me know"
619,00:24:27.23,00:24:27.23,which way... if you're... if you're going with their side
620,00:24:29.80,00:24:29.80,or staying on our side?
621,00:24:31.13,00:24:31.13,I'm staying on you and Jake's side.
622,00:24:32.90,00:24:32.90,"Well, that's what I'm talking about."
623,00:24:34.40,00:24:34.40,But I'm not staying on Penny and Erin's side.
624,00:24:36.87,00:24:36.87,Penny's the one that got to go.
625,00:24:38.13,00:24:38.13,"I've talked about it with Brian, too."
626,00:24:39.87,00:24:39.87,She's going-- just not yet.
627,00:24:41.67,00:24:41.67,"Let us get an advantage first, then we'll take out Penny."
628,00:24:44.70,00:24:44.70,We're gonna do that next.
629,00:24:46.13,00:24:46.13," In fact, we're even-numbered  here, five and five."
630,00:24:48.63,00:24:48.63,"Now you're gonna give them an advantage, thinking,"
631,00:24:51.37,00:24:51.37,"you know, because you're.... because you're like"
632,00:24:53.73,00:24:53.73,"a little snake, now they're gonna, like, invite you in?"
633,00:24:56.40,00:24:56.40,That shows disloyalty from the beginning.
634,00:24:58.87,00:24:58.87,"She's making herself an outcast on both sides, at this point."
635,00:25:01.07,00:25:01.07,I know you're pissed off at Penny
636,00:25:02.47,00:25:02.47,and you want to get rid of her
637,00:25:04.03,00:25:04.03,"and you don't want her to make the jury,"
638,00:25:05.83,00:25:05.83,"but don't sink everybody else and yourself,"
639,00:25:08.10,00:25:08.10,because you're pissed off at one person.
640,00:25:10.17,00:25:10.17,And that's what you're doing.
641,00:25:11.67,00:25:11.67,So just think about it and let me know what's going on.
642,00:25:17.40,00:25:17.40,SHII ANN:  I don't think
643,00:25:18.90,00:25:18.90, I'm gonna discuss this  with Ken anymore.

790,00:32:42.27,00:32:42.27,"-Go, go, go! -Start digging!"
791,00:32:44.27,00:32:44.27,"Chuay Gahn,"
792,00:32:45.63,00:32:45.63,you're gonna have to dig a pretty big hole for Big Ted.
793,00:32:47.60,00:32:47.60,(Jan speaks indistinctly)
794,00:32:49.23,00:32:49.23,"PROBST: You're still in this, Sook Jai."
795,00:32:52.03,00:32:52.03,Sook Jai still has one key on the ground.
796,00:32:55.37,00:32:55.37,Helen's half out.
797,00:32:58.70,00:32:58.70,One member out for Chuay Gahn.
798,00:33:00.37,00:33:00.37,"Sook Jai, don't quit."
799,00:33:03.17,00:33:03.17,Three members out for Chuay Gahn.
800,00:33:08.70,00:33:08.70,"Come on, Clay!"
801,00:33:09.83,00:33:09.83,"-Wait, wait, wait, wait! -(Ted grunting)"
802,00:33:12.40,00:33:12.40,(Ted continues grunting)
803,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,Let's go! Here we go!
804,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13,PROBST: Let me see those keys.
805,00:33:21.97,00:33:21.97,Fifteen. Chuay Gahn wins immunity!
806,00:33:25.33,00:33:25.33,Yeah!
807,00:33:32.03,00:33:32.03,Chuay Gahn has immunity.
808,00:33:33.30,00:33:33.30,-Yay! -You guys are safe three more days.
809,00:33:35.33,00:33:35.33,"Sook Jai, nice effort, guys."
810,00:33:37.37,00:33:37.37,"Unfortunately, not enough."
811,00:33:39.80,00:33:39.80,You know what this means-- Tribal Council.
812,00:33:41.90,00:33:41.90,Somebody's going home tonight.
813,00:33:43.63,00:33:43.63,You guys need to head straight over there.
814,00:33:45.70,00:33:45.70,We'll see you there shortly.
815,00:34:10.57,00:34:10.57,CLAY: I'm gonna tell y'all  what that was like.
816,00:34:13.57,00:34:13.57,"That was like going to Thanksgiving dinner,"
817,00:34:15.57,00:34:15.57,"and somebody just slapped the ... out of Grandma,"
818,00:34:17.80,00:34:17.80,and both families split and started fighting again.
819,00:34:20.10,00:34:20.10,"JAN (laughs):  Well, we had"
820,00:34:22.50,00:34:22.50," another challenge,  but it was a trick."
821,00:34:25.67,00:34:25.67,We thought it was a merge of the two tribes.
822,00:34:29.30,00:34:29.30,"And, of course, when we got there, to our surprise,"
823,00:34:32.53,00:34:32.53,"it was not a merge,"
824,00:34:34.00,00:34:34.00," we are still two tribes,"
825,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80," vying for, uh, immunity."
826,00:34:38.60,00:34:38.60,"-They're gone. -Yeah, they're at Tribal Council, y'all."
827,00:34:40.70,00:34:40.70,They're not getting a break. They there.
828,00:34:42.97,00:34:42.97,TED: After today...
829,00:34:44.50,00:34:44.50,"-CLAY: Anything. -...anything, I mean,"
830,00:34:46.77,00:34:46.77,now we got a situation where we're sleeping with the enemy.
831,00:35:06.60,00:35:06.60,PROBST: Welcome to Tribal Council.
832,00:35:11.20,00:35:11.20,"So, tonight, a very big vote."
833,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,"If you survive tonight's vote, you are in this game,"
834,00:35:16.90,00:35:16.90,"one way or another, until the end,"
835,00:35:18.53,00:35:18.53,"because, at the very least, you'll be a member of the jury"
836,00:35:21.20,00:35:21.20,"and have a big impact on who, ultimately, wins this game."
837,00:35:24.83,00:35:24.83,"All right, so,"
838,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27,"you get to the beach, everything's great."
839,00:35:28.87,00:35:28.87,You start assuming that we're merging and that it's gonna be
840,00:35:31.23,00:35:31.23,an individual challenge.
841,00:35:32.30,00:35:32.30,"You show up and you find out,"
842,00:35:34.03,00:35:34.03,"no, it's still tribal. Erin,"
843,00:35:36.30,00:35:36.30,"what's your reaction, at that point,"
844,00:35:37.83,00:35:37.83,"as you're sitting there, listening to me explain"
845,00:35:39.87,00:35:39.87,that it's tribe versus tribe?
846,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,"ERIN: I was in complete shock,"
847,00:35:43.80,00:35:43.80,because I thought that we were gonna go to...
848,00:35:47.37,00:35:47.37,"an immunity challenge for individuals,"
849,00:35:50.37,00:35:50.37,we were gonna get new buffs
850,00:35:51.80,00:35:51.80,and that we all had merged into one tribe.
851,00:35:54.07,00:35:54.07,That's how we've been living for the past couple days.
852,00:35:55.83,00:35:55.83,So I'm still in shock that we're two separate tribes.
853,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,"PROBST: Well, we're getting a lot of weather,"
854,00:36:00.97,00:36:00.97,"the wind's blowing through here, now the rain is"
855,00:36:03.03,00:36:03.03,starting to come down outside.
856,00:36:04.57,00:36:04.57,Sort of a fitting end to a turbulent three days.
857,00:36:07.80,00:36:07.80,(Shii Ann gasps)
858,00:36:10.20,00:36:10.20,"Nice catch, Jake."
859,00:36:11.50,00:36:11.50,"JAKE: Thanks, I'd hate to lose this."
860,00:36:13.33,00:36:13.33,"PROBST: Jake,"
861,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,how does this impact the game?
862,00:36:17.50,00:36:17.50,"Clearly, you guys were working toward the thought"
863,00:36:20.13,00:36:20.13,that this would become a merge and an individual game.
864,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,"We're gonna be down to four tonight,"
865,00:36:26.57,00:36:26.57,and they're gonna be at five.
866,00:36:27.87,00:36:27.87,So what we're gonna have to do now is just
867,00:36:29.93,00:36:29.93,reorganize our thoughts and go back in
868,00:36:32.40,00:36:32.40,"with some adaptable ideas,"
869,00:36:34.30,00:36:34.30,and see where we're going.
870,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,"Erin, you reckon"
871,00:36:36.83,00:36:36.83,there's been some information shared
872,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,in the last two and a half days
873,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,that people might be regretting a little bit?
874,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,I feel that there may be a little bit of information shared
875,00:36:46.40,00:36:46.40,in the past couple days.
876,00:36:47.73,00:36:47.73,I have already found out
877,00:36:49.07,00:36:49.07,"that some people weren't being true to our tribe,"
878,00:36:52.30,00:36:52.30,and were kind of trying to win over some
879,00:36:54.70,00:36:54.70,"of the other Chuay Gahn members, thinking it was a merge."
880,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,"And it is, um... kind of disheartening,"
881,00:37:00.13,00:37:00.13,"thinking that, you know, your tribe,"
882,00:37:02.13,00:37:02.13,"that you thought you trusted,"
883,00:37:03.30,00:37:03.30,now is starting to really look out
884,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,for themselves rather than for their entire tribe.
885,00:37:08.00,00:37:08.00,"PROBST: Penny, how do you"
886,00:37:09.53,00:37:09.53,figure out how you're gonna vote?
887,00:37:11.53,00:37:11.53,Because certainly there's some strategy in this.
888,00:37:13.40,00:37:13.40,"PENNY: There is strategy in this,"
889,00:37:15.47,00:37:15.47,but it's more so kind of information
890,00:37:17.53,00:37:17.53,"that was brought to my attention,"
891,00:37:19.40,00:37:19.40,saying that one of my tribe members
892,00:37:21.27,00:37:21.27,has said that I'm the next to go.
893,00:37:24.10,00:37:24.10,"So, you talk about trust,"
894,00:37:26.13,00:37:26.13,and I've had to trust these people
895,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,for 18 days.
896,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,"Well, the last 24 hours, I'm thinking,"
897,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,who can I not trust?
898,00:37:32.37,00:37:32.37,"Well, guys, this is always an open forum."
899,00:37:35.80,00:37:35.80,"-Good. -You haven't had a chance to talk until now,"
900,00:37:38.47,00:37:38.47,"but clearly, there's stuff going on-- I can sense it,"
901,00:37:41.03,00:37:41.03,-and I can see Shii Ann. -I'd like... I'd love to speak.
902,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,Hey.
903,00:37:44.77,00:37:44.77,This is not a tribe unified.
904,00:37:46.47,00:37:46.47,It's never been a tribe unified.
905,00:37:48.17,00:37:48.17,As much as everyone here would like to think
906,00:37:50.40,00:37:50.40,"it was a tribe unified, this has not been the case."
907,00:37:53.67,00:37:53.67,And I've been the brunt.
908,00:37:55.40,00:37:55.40,I've been the person who felt that the most the entire time.
909,00:37:58.90,00:37:58.90,So is it surprising for me to go to Chuay Gahn
910,00:38:01.60,00:38:01.60,"and find five people who are really lovely,"
911,00:38:04.03,00:38:04.03,who I can talk to for the first time
912,00:38:06.80,00:38:06.80,and realize that the people who mistreated me at Sook Jai
913,00:38:11.53,00:38:11.53,are also the people who Chuay Gahn distrusts the most.
914,00:38:15.70,00:38:15.70,"You don't think they asked about you, Ken?"
915,00:38:17.50,00:38:17.50,You were the first person they asked about.
916,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,And I watch your back.
917,00:38:21.60,00:38:21.60,"Jake, same thing."
918,00:38:23.93,00:38:23.93,You know that I've always been loyal to you.
919,00:38:27.97,00:38:27.97,"Penny, you're manipulative because I know you don't..."
920,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,"I know that that's not a pleasant word,"
921,00:38:34.47,00:38:34.47,but it's the way that you've played the game.
922,00:38:36.73,00:38:36.73,"If we go back today and I'm out, and not Penny,"
923,00:38:40.77,00:38:40.77,that's gonna leave another impression with those guys.
924,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,"Penny, what's your take on all this?"
925,00:38:45.70,00:38:45.70,I've had plenty of opportunity to vote Shii Ann out
926,00:38:49.13,00:38:49.13,"if I wanted to, and I chose not to."
927,00:38:51.87,00:38:51.87,'Cause I told her that the five of us
928,00:38:54.20,00:38:54.20,should go in strong.
929,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43,I don't feel like I've been manipulative.
930,00:38:57.73,00:38:57.73,"And, you know, bottom line is,"
931,00:38:59.73,00:38:59.73,is we're still Sook Jai.
932,00:39:01.20,00:39:01.20,We are still Sook Jai.
933,00:39:03.00,00:39:03.00,"No matter what Chuay Gahn thinks or says,"
934,00:39:05.87,00:39:05.87,these are the people that I need to be with.
935,00:39:08.70,00:39:08.70,And these are the ones that I'm concerned with.
936,00:39:10.67,00:39:10.67,I'm not concerned with them.
937,00:39:11.90,00:39:11.90,"So, Shii Ann, what is the plea you're making?"
938,00:39:13.47,00:39:13.47,"Are you making an offer? Are you saying,"
939,00:39:15.47,00:39:15.47,here's what we should do?
940,00:39:16.90,00:39:16.90,"SHII ANN: What I'm saying is,"
941,00:39:18.90,00:39:18.90,"Jake, Ken, Erin,"
942,00:39:20.60,00:39:20.60,I know that you're thinking about voting me off.
943,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,"I mean honestly, today, I didn't make any decisions."
944,00:39:27.27,00:39:27.27,I told you that I would come up and tell you.
945,00:39:29.77,00:39:29.77,I have not lied to you yet.
946,00:39:32.20,00:39:32.20,I have not come up to you
947,00:39:34.63,00:39:34.63,and tried to backstab someone else yet.
948,00:39:36.83,00:39:36.83,You got to look at the whole 18 days.
949,00:39:38.77,00:39:38.77,You can't just look at what happened today.
950,00:39:41.63,00:39:41.63,"And I'm saying don't vote me out,"
951,00:39:44.30,00:39:44.30,"because I've... promised to be on your sides,"
952,00:39:48.10,00:39:48.10,"and I still maintain that promise,"
953,00:39:50.73,00:39:50.73,"and when we go back to tribe,"
954,00:39:53.47,00:39:53.47,"if I'm with you guys,"
955,00:39:55.13,00:39:55.13,I think I know more intimately how...
956,00:39:57.13,00:39:57.13,"where their heads are than any of you,"
957,00:39:59.63,00:39:59.63,and that's gonna come in handy.
958,00:40:01.47,00:40:01.47,"PROBST: Well, clearly, there is"
959,00:40:03.00,00:40:03.00,a bit of a cloud hanging over this tribe at the moment.
960,00:40:05.97,00:40:05.97,The big question now is: How will that new information
961,00:40:09.30,00:40:09.30,impact tonight's vote?
962,00:40:10.67,00:40:10.67,"It is time to find out, because it's time to vote."
963,00:40:13.53,00:40:13.53,"Shii Ann, you're first."
964,00:40:42.13,00:40:42.13,"Tonight, I'm voting for Shii Ann."
965,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17, It's obvious that  you broke alliances
966,00:40:46.77,00:40:46.77,"and all I have to say is, what comes around goes around."
967,00:41:08.03,00:41:08.03,I'll go tally the votes.
968,00:41:20.40,00:41:20.40,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
969,00:41:23.13,00:41:23.13,Person voted out will be asked to leave
970,00:41:24.97,00:41:24.97,the Tribal Council area immediately.
971,00:41:26.23,00:41:26.23,I'll read the votes.
972,00:41:31.43,00:41:31.43,First vote...
973,00:41:33.83,00:41:33.83,Shii Ann.
974,00:41:37.67,00:41:37.67,Penny.
975,00:41:42.90,00:41:42.90,Shii Ann.
976,00:41:44.27,00:41:44.27,"That's two votes Shii Ann, one vote Penny."
977,00:41:50.30,00:41:50.30,Shii Ann.
978,00:41:52.10,00:41:52.10,You need to bring me your torch.
979,00:42:02.10,00:42:02.10,"Shii Ann, the tribe has spoken."
980,00:42:06.87,00:42:06.87,"Good luck, you guys."
981,00:42:08.53,00:42:08.53,PROBST: It's time for you to go.
982,00:42:26.40,00:42:26.40,"Well, there were a lot of comments made tonight."
983,00:42:29.30,00:42:29.30,This tribe's either gonna rebound and grow stronger
984,00:42:32.03,00:42:32.03,or fracture completely.
985,00:42:33.77,00:42:33.77,"Something to think about on a long, wet walk home."
986,00:42:36.57,00:42:36.57,You guys can head back to camp.
987,00:42:48.83,00:42:48.83, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
