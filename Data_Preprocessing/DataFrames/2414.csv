650,00:21:01.03,00:21:01.03,AND I'M LUCKY THAT YOU AND I
651,00:21:02.73,00:21:02.73,DEVELOPED A FRIENDSHIP THAT WE
652,00:21:04.03,00:21:04.03,HAD EACH OTHER'S BACKS.
653,00:21:05.03,00:21:05.03,I FEEL THE SAME WAY.
654,00:21:06.77,00:21:06.77,I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE EVER
655,00:21:10.40,00:21:10.40,FELT MORE COMFORTABLE GOING INTO
656,00:21:12.83,00:21:12.83,TRIBAL.
657,00:21:13.53,00:21:13.53,KIM HAS HAD MY BACK THROUGHOUT
658,00:21:14.47,00:21:14.47,THIS GAME.
659,00:21:15.67,00:21:15.67,SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN 100% HONEST
660,00:21:18.03,00:21:18.03,WITH ME.
661,00:21:19.03,00:21:19.03,"A MILLION-DOLLAR GAME, SHE"
662,00:21:21.13,00:21:21.13,"THINKS I COULD WIN IT, AND SHE"
663,00:21:22.67,00:21:22.67,STILL WANTS ME TO GO TO THE
664,00:21:24.57,00:21:24.57,FINAL WITH HER.
665,00:21:26.13,00:21:26.13,HOPEFULLY SHE'S NOT ABOUT TO
666,00:21:27.67,00:21:27.67,BACKSTAB ME BUT I DON'T THINK
667,00:21:28.53,00:21:28.53,THAT'S THE CASE.
668,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,YOU COULD SAY YOU WANT ME OUT OF
669,00:21:32.70,00:21:32.70,HERE IF YOU TALK TO ALICIA OR
670,00:21:34.63,00:21:34.63,SABRINA AND GET THEM TO VOTE FOR
671,00:21:35.83,00:21:35.83,ME AND GIVE ME THE IDOL AND
672,00:21:37.60,00:21:37.60,FIREWORKS GO OFF.
673,00:21:38.80,00:21:38.80,AT THE TIME IT SEEMED LIKE
674,00:21:40.63,00:21:40.63,SUCH A SMART THING TELLING CHELS
675,00:21:43.27,00:21:43.27,I I HAD THE IDOL.
676,00:21:46.03,00:21:46.03,I CAN SAY SITTING HERE TODAY I
677,00:21:47.67,00:21:47.67,WISH SHE DIDN'T KNOW.
678,00:21:49.40,00:21:49.40,SHE'S EXPECTING ME TO PLAY THE
679,00:21:50.93,00:21:50.93,IDOL FOR HER.
680,00:21:51.63,00:21:51.63,I HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL HOW I
681,00:21:53.53,00:21:53.53,PLAY TONIGHT.
682,00:21:54.30,00:21:54.30,I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALL THESE
683,00:21:55.67,00:21:55.67,WEAPONS IN MY BELT AND I WANT TO
684,00:21:56.87,00:21:56.87,PLAY THE RIGHT ONES AND NOT GET
685,00:21:58.80,00:21:58.80,THEM ALL OUT AND PLAY ALL OF
686,00:22:01.70,00:22:01.70,THEM FOR THE HELL OF IT.
687,00:22:05.50,00:22:05.50,I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT
688,00:22:06.70,00:22:06.70,CHELSEA AND I JUST TALKED.
689,00:22:07.97,00:22:07.97,OKAY.
690,00:22:11.87,00:22:11.87,PERFECT.
691,00:22:12.37,00:22:12.37,OKAY.
692,00:22:13.47,00:22:13.47,SOUNDS GOOD.
693,00:22:15.17,00:22:15.17,NO MORE DISCUSSION.
694,00:22:15.90,00:22:15.90,I'M DONE.
695,00:22:20.50,00:22:20.50,SHE'S PROBABLY ASKING HER WHO
696,00:22:22.70,00:22:22.70,WE SHOULD VOTE.
697,00:22:23.47,00:22:23.47,I DEFINITELY FEEL CONFIDENT THAT
698,00:22:25.57,00:22:25.57,KIM IS 100% LOYAL TO ME.
699,00:22:28.63,00:22:28.63,"I MEAN, EVEN WHEN I SIT BACK AND"
700,00:22:31.37,00:22:31.37,"SASS EVERYTHING, WHY IN THE HELL"
701,00:22:33.80,00:22:33.80,WOULD SHE WANT TO SIT NEXT TO
702,00:22:35.83,00:22:35.83,CHELSEA AND SABRINA AND HAVE ALL
703,00:22:37.80,00:22:37.80,THOSE VOTES JUST SPLIT?
704,00:22:39.90,00:22:39.90,"SO I NEED TO, LOOK."
705,00:22:41.10,00:22:41.10,"NOT BE PARANOID, RELAX, AND"
706,00:22:44.70,00:22:44.70,DON'T OVERTHINK STUFF.
707,00:22:45.47,00:22:45.47,I GOT THIS.
708,00:22:49.90,00:22:49.90,"WHO DOES SHE THINK IT IS, ME?"
709,00:22:52.37,00:22:52.37,YES.
710,00:22:52.77,00:22:52.77,"OH, MY GOD."
711,00:22:53.97,00:22:53.97,"I MEAN IT'S DONE, IT'S DONE,"
712,00:22:56.13,00:22:56.13,IT'S DONE.
713,00:22:57.80,00:22:57.80,I BELIEVE WHAT KIM SAID THAT
714,00:22:59.60,00:22:59.60,SHE'S GOING TO VOTE CHELSEA OUT
715,00:23:01.47,00:23:01.47,AND SABRINA AND CHELSEA BOTH
716,00:23:03.57,00:23:03.57,BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE ALICIA
717,00:23:05.37,00:23:05.37,TO GO.
718,00:23:06.47,00:23:06.47,KIM WOULD BE A FOOL NOT TO VOTE
719,00:23:07.57,00:23:07.57,FOR CHELSEA.
720,00:23:08.67,00:23:08.67,IT WOULD BE HER BIGGEST
721,00:23:10.30,00:23:10.30,COMPETITOR.
722,00:23:11.00,00:23:11.00,SO DON'T EVEN TRY TO WORK IT.
723,00:23:12.37,00:23:12.37,JUST LEAVE IT BE.
724,00:23:13.77,00:23:13.77,WE'RE TOTALLY FINE.
725,00:23:15.70,00:23:15.70,EVERYBODY KNOWS WHERE EVERYBODY
726,00:23:17.33,00:23:17.33,ELSE STANDS BECAUSE OF ME.
727,00:23:19.27,00:23:19.27,I'VE TOLD SABRINA AND CHELSEA
728,00:23:20.47,00:23:20.47,WHAT THE OTHER SIDE IS DOING AND
729,00:23:22.73,00:23:22.73,ALICIAA AND CHRISTINA WHAT
730,00:23:24.17,00:23:24.17,THEY'RE DOING AND I REALLY COULD
731,00:23:25.60,00:23:25.60,GO EITHER WAY AT THIS POINT.
732,00:23:39.30,00:23:39.30,Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
733,00:23:40.47,00:23:40.47,THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
734,00:23:46.13,00:23:46.13,JONAS.
735,00:23:47.07,00:23:47.07,MICHAEL.
736,00:23:47.73,00:23:47.73,"JAY, LEIF, TROYZAN, KAT, AND"
737,00:23:51.67,00:23:51.67,"TARZAN, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST"
738,00:23:53.50,00:23:53.50,TRIBAL COUNCIL.
739,00:23:59.87,00:23:59.87,"ALICIA, DAY 37."
740,00:24:01.47,00:24:01.47,FIVE WOMEN LEFT.
741,00:24:02.47,00:24:02.47,"TWO OF YOU WILL JOIN THE JURY,"
742,00:24:04.37,00:24:04.37,THREE OF YOU WILL MAKE IT TO THE
743,00:24:06.07,00:24:06.07,END.
744,00:24:06.77,00:24:06.77,WHAT WAS THE VIBE AROUND CAMP
745,00:24:09.27,00:24:09.27,THIS AFTERNOON KNOWING SOMEBODY
746,00:24:10.50,00:24:10.50,WAS GOING HOME TONIGHT?
747,00:24:11.77,00:24:11.77,"I ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, CAME"
748,00:24:13.93,00:24:13.93,BACK AND IT WAS QUIET.
749,00:24:14.80,00:24:14.80,I THOUGHT IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF
750,00:24:16.23,00:24:16.23,THE FIRST TIMES THAT WE WENT
751,00:24:17.47,00:24:17.47,BACK THAT I DIDN'T SEE
752,00:24:20.83,00:24:20.83,SCRAMBLING.
753,00:24:21.43,00:24:21.43,"Jeff: CHELSEA, WHAT WAS"
754,00:24:22.27,00:24:22.27,YOUR TAKE ON HOW THINGS WENT
755,00:24:23.53,00:24:23.53,AFTER YOU GOT BACK TO CAMP?
756,00:24:25.47,00:24:25.47,I AGREE.
757,00:24:26.23,00:24:26.23,IT WAS PRETTY QUIET TODAY.
758,00:24:27.53,00:24:27.53,AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE
759,00:24:29.87,00:24:29.87,"LESS PEOPLE THERE ARE, THE LESS"
760,00:24:31.90,00:24:31.90,PEOPLE THERE ARE TO GO SCRAMBLE.
761,00:24:33.37,00:24:33.37,IT'S EASY TO TAKE ONE PERSON OFF
762,00:24:35.47,00:24:35.47,THE SIDE.
763,00:24:36.50,00:24:36.50,IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE
764,00:24:37.70,00:24:37.70,IT'S EITHER THIS OR THAT.
765,00:24:39.13,00:24:39.13,Jeff: SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S
766,00:24:40.17,00:24:40.17,"QUIET, IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S"
767,00:24:41.60,00:24:41.60,NOT PARANOIA.
768,00:24:42.20,00:24:42.20,RIGHT.
769,00:24:42.80,00:24:42.80,"Jeff: BECAUSE NOW, AS YOU"
770,00:24:43.87,00:24:43.87,"SAY, ALL IT TAKES IS A VERY"
771,00:24:46.20,00:24:46.20,QUICK COMMENT TO A COUPLE OF
772,00:24:47.70,00:24:47.70,PEOPLE AND THE VOTE IS DONE.
773,00:24:49.47,00:24:49.47,OF COURSE WE'RE ALL PARANOID
774,00:24:50.90,00:24:50.90,BECAUSE WE SEE THE LIGHT AT THE
775,00:24:52.10,00:24:52.10,END OF THE TUNNEL AND WEAN WE'RE
776,00:24:53.70,00:24:53.70,"ALMOST THERE, AND TO LEAVE NOW"
777,00:24:55.60,00:24:55.60,WOULD JUST BE KNOW-- IT WOULD
778,00:24:59.73,00:24:59.73,SUCK.
779,00:25:00.33,00:25:00.33,"Jeff: SO, KIM, WAS THIS A"
780,00:25:01.70,00:25:01.70,DIFFICULT AFTERNOON?
781,00:25:02.53,00:25:02.53,"BECAUSE ON ONE HAND, YOU HAVE TO"
782,00:25:04.00,00:25:04.00,"BE CELEBRATING THE FABT THAT,"
783,00:25:05.57,00:25:05.57,"A., I WON MY THIRD IMMUNITY"
784,00:25:07.37,00:25:07.37,CHALLENGE.
785,00:25:07.97,00:25:07.97,YOU CAN'T BE VOTED OUT.
786,00:25:09.60,00:25:09.60,"AND, B., YOU HAVE A BIG VOTE."
787,00:25:11.60,00:25:11.60,THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE.
788,00:25:12.70,00:25:12.70,AND NOW I'M GOING TO CUT ONE OF
789,00:25:14.60,00:25:14.60,THEM LOOSE.
790,00:25:15.07,00:25:15.07,IT WAS DIFFICULT.
791,00:25:16.17,00:25:16.17,"UN, YOU COME AND YOU SAY YOU'RE"
792,00:25:17.70,00:25:17.70,GOING TO PLAY A GAME AND YOU'RE
793,00:25:18.97,00:25:18.97,GOING TO PLAY IT WITH YOUR HEAD
794,00:25:20.60,00:25:20.60,AND YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY
795,00:25:22.90,00:25:22.90,STRATEGY.
796,00:25:23.60,00:25:23.60,IT'S STILL HARD AT THE END OF
797,00:25:24.73,00:25:24.73,THE DAY.
798,00:25:25.43,00:25:25.43,I REALLY LIKE ALL OF THE WOMEN I
799,00:25:26.63,00:25:26.63,AM SITTING HERE WITH.
800,00:25:28.07,00:25:28.07,AND YOU'RE NOT JUST MAKING A
801,00:25:29.33,00:25:29.33,CHOICE FOR TONIGHT.
802,00:25:30.00,00:25:30.00,YOU'RE MAKING A CHOICE FOR
803,00:25:31.13,00:25:31.13,TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY AND
804,00:25:32.30,00:25:32.30,THE JURY.
805,00:25:33.67,00:25:33.67,IT ENCOMPASSES A LOT AND IT'S
806,00:25:35.03,00:25:35.03,KIND OF OVERWHELMING.
807,00:25:35.93,00:25:35.93,Jeff: ARE YOUR DECISIONS
808,00:25:37.13,00:25:37.13,FOR TONIGHT AND TOMORROW ALREADY
809,00:25:38.67,00:25:38.67,MADE OR IS TONIGHT ONE DECISION
810,00:25:40.53,00:25:40.53,AND TOMORROW YOU WILL HAVE TO
811,00:25:41.73,00:25:41.73,DECIDE YET AGAIN?
812,00:25:42.37,00:25:42.37,"I MEAN, TOMORROW I HAVE TO"
813,00:25:44.17,00:25:44.17,DECIDE YET AGAIN BECAUSE THERE'S
814,00:25:46.37,00:25:46.37,ANOTHER IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
815,00:25:47.03,00:25:47.03,COMING AND THAT COULD CHANGE
816,00:25:48.60,00:25:48.60,EVERYTHING.
817,00:25:49.20,00:25:49.20,Jeff: SO THE CRITERIA--
818,00:25:51.13,00:25:51.13,"LOYALTY, THREAT TO WIN, DESERVES"
819,00:25:52.73,00:25:52.73,TO BE IN THE END-- ALL
820,00:25:55.37,00:25:55.37,LEGITIMATE REASONS TO TAKE
821,00:25:56.30,00:25:56.30,SOMEBODY OR GET RID OF SOMEBODY.
822,00:25:57.67,00:25:57.67,LOYALTY IS HUGE BECAUSE
823,00:26:01.23,00:26:01.23,TOMORROW IF I DON'T WIN
824,00:26:02.60,00:26:02.60,"IMMUNITY, I I WANT TO MAKE SURE"
825,00:26:03.83,00:26:03.83,I'M NOT THE PERSON HEADING TO
826,00:26:04.93,00:26:04.93,THE JURY.
827,00:26:05.63,00:26:05.63,"THREAT TO WIN, THAT'S ALSO SUPER"
828,00:26:07.67,00:26:07.67,SCARY.
829,00:26:08.33,00:26:08.33,"I MEAN, THERE'S A COUPLE OF"
830,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,PEOPLE SITTING HERE --
831,00:26:10.13,00:26:10.13,"HOLD ON, LET'S GO BACK TO"
832,00:26:12.33,00:26:12.33,LOYALTY.
833,00:26:13.00,00:26:13.00,"OBVIOUSLY, EVERYBODY'S BEEN"
834,00:26:13.77,00:26:13.77,LOYAL BECAUSE THE FIVE OF YOU
835,00:26:15.10,00:26:15.10,ARE SITTING HERE.
836,00:26:15.90,00:26:15.90,YOU GOT RID OF THE MEN.
837,00:26:17.17,00:26:17.17,THAT CAN'T BE AN EASY DECISION.
838,00:26:18.53,00:26:18.53,"I MEAN, TO ME, IT ALL COMES"
839,00:26:21.23,00:26:21.23,DOWN TO PERCEPTION AND
840,00:26:24.47,00:26:24.47,SELF-PERCEPTION AND HOW I DO
841,00:26:25.30,00:26:25.30,"THINK PEOPLE SEE ME, WHO I DO"
842,00:26:26.97,00:26:26.97,"THINK I CAN BEAT, WHAT WILL THEY"
843,00:26:29.27,00:26:29.27,RESPECT?
844,00:26:29.67,00:26:29.67,IT'S TOUGH.
845,00:26:30.23,00:26:30.23,Jeff: WHY IS IT TOUGH
846,00:26:30.93,00:26:30.93,BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD
847,00:26:32.07,00:26:32.07,SAY THIS IS THE EASIEST DECISION
848,00:26:33.33,00:26:33.33,IN THE WORLD.
849,00:26:34.20,00:26:34.20,I PICK THE PERSON I CAN BEAT.
850,00:26:35.73,00:26:35.73,I THINK IT'S JUST MY HEART.
851,00:26:37.23,00:26:37.23,"LIKE, IT DOES GET IN THE WAY."
852,00:26:39.73,00:26:39.73,ISN'T THAT A SONG?
853,00:26:40.80,00:26:40.80,"YOU KNOW, I THINK I THOUGHT THAT"
854,00:26:42.77,00:26:42.77,THIS WOULD BE EASIER TO PLAY
855,00:26:44.73,00:26:44.73,HEART AND HEAD SEPARATE.
856,00:26:45.90,00:26:45.90,LIKE I THOUGHT I COULD COME AND
857,00:26:47.47,00:26:47.47,STAY TOTALLY IN THE GAME AND
858,00:26:48.60,00:26:48.60,STAY TOTALLY IN MY HEAD AND
859,00:26:50.47,00:26:50.47,STRATEGIZE AND NOT FOCUS ON MY

1161,00:37:27.40,00:37:27.40,HAVE GONE DIFFERENTLY.
1162,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,THERE'S NO DOUBT HE WAS ONE OF

1570,00:52:34.03,00:52:34.03,"AND I WAS LIKE, ""IT'S YOU."""

1575,00:52:41.27,00:52:41.27,I FEEL LIKE SHE DOESN'T GET ANY
1576,00:52:44.03,00:52:44.03,VOTES.
1577,00:52:44.37,00:52:44.37,I KNOW.
1578,00:52:45.03,00:52:45.03,SO... THE INTERESTING THING
1579,00:52:47.67,00:52:47.67,ABOUT CHRISTINA'S RESPONSE IS
1580,00:52:49.50,00:52:49.50,SHE LITERALLY DIDN'T FIGHT FOR
1581,00:52:50.93,00:52:50.93,IT.
1582,00:52:51.53,00:52:51.53,I FEEL LIKE I DID MAKE MY
1583,00:52:53.13,00:52:53.13,DECISION TO GO WITH CHELSEA AND
1584,00:52:54.90,00:52:54.90,"SABRINA, BUT I THINK I'M"
1585,00:52:55.67,00:52:55.67,STARTING TO SECOND GUESS MYSELF.

1588,00:53:00.67,00:53:00.67,I MEAN?
1589,00:53:01.37,00:53:01.37,THERE WERE MORE CHANCES TO GO
1590,00:53:02.63,00:53:02.63,HOME.
1591,00:53:03.37,00:53:03.37,THE DECISION IS GOING TO CHANGE
1592,00:53:04.17,00:53:04.17,WHO I SIT THERE AT THE END WITH.
1593,00:53:06.10,00:53:06.10,"I THINK IF I DO TAKE KRISTINA, I"
1594,00:53:09.57,00:53:09.57,REALLY DON'T THINK SHE COULD GET
1595,00:53:11.17,00:53:11.17,ONE VOTE.
1596,00:53:11.83,00:53:11.83,AND I DO THINK SABRINA WILL
1597,00:53:13.73,00:53:13.73,RECEIVE QUITE A FEW MORE VOTES
1598,00:53:15.57,00:53:15.57,THAN CHRISTINA WOULD.
1599,00:53:17.03,00:53:17.03,I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE WHAT I
1600,00:53:17.97,00:53:17.97,THINK IS THE BEST DECISION FOR
1601,00:53:18.73,00:53:18.73,MYSELF IN THIS GAME.

1652,00:55:02.03,00:55:02.03,SO EVERYONE IS PRETTY ADAMANT
1653,00:55:04.00,00:55:04.00,ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND.
1654,00:55:05.37,00:55:05.37,"Jeff: WELL, WHAT'S NOT"
1655,00:55:06.73,00:55:06.73,CLEAR TO ME IS WHY THAT MEANS IT
1656,00:55:08.77,00:55:08.77,MADE FOR A QUIET AFTERNOON.
1657,00:55:10.20,00:55:10.20,WAS THERE A STRATEGY FROM YOUR
1658,00:55:11.97,00:55:11.97,END IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BREAK
1659,00:55:13.40,00:55:13.40,THIS UP OR HAVE SOMEBODY SEE THE
1660,00:55:15.43,00:55:15.43,LIGHT OR BRING A NEW IDEA TO IT?
1661,00:55:17.67,00:55:17.67,MY ARGUMENT WOULD BE SABRINA

1665,00:55:23.27,00:55:23.27,HAVEN'T SEEN HER DO ANYTHING.

1669,00:55:30.03,00:55:30.03,WITH THEM.
1670,00:55:30.73,00:55:30.73,IT'S A PARTNERSHIP THEY HAVE AND
1671,00:55:32.30,00:55:32.30,TRYING TO BREAK IT IS REALLY
1672,00:55:34.10,00:55:34.10,HARD.
1673,00:55:34.70,00:55:34.70,"Jeff: SABRINA, ARE YOU AT"

1678,00:55:42.73,00:55:42.73,"YOU KNOW, I CAN'T READ"
1679,00:55:44.80,00:55:44.80,ANYONE'S MIND.
1680,00:55:45.63,00:55:45.63,"I CAN'T LOOK AT HER AND SAY,"
1681,00:55:47.43,00:55:47.43,"OKAY, WHY ARE YOU HERE?"
1682,00:55:48.50,00:55:48.50,"BUT FROM HER ACTIONS ALONE, IT"
1683,00:55:51.03,00:55:51.03,WOULDN'T SEEM THAT SHE WAS HERE
1684,00:55:52.43,00:55:52.43,TO ACTUALLY WIN OR AT LEAST SHE
1685,00:55:53.83,00:55:53.83,WOULD HAVE MADE AN EFFORT.
1686,00:55:55.30,00:55:55.30,AND JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE
1687,00:55:57.40,00:55:57.40,ME SCRAMBLING AROUND I DON'T
1688,00:55:59.43,00:55:59.43,KNOW FULLY WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
1689,00:56:01.93,00:56:01.93,SINCE AT A ONE.
1690,00:56:03.70,00:56:03.70,PERCEPTION IS NOT ALWAYS
1691,00:56:05.67,00:56:05.67,REALITY.
1692,00:56:06.40,00:56:06.40,I KNEW I WOULD HAVE GONE OUT IF
1693,00:56:08.33,00:56:08.33,I KNEW MY NAME WAS ON THE

1985,01:06:54.30,01:06:54.30,CHANGED AT THE MERGE.

1987,01:06:57.80,01:06:57.80,THAT'S JUST A GOOD PERSON IN

1990,01:07:03.10,01:07:03.10,WRITING YOUR NAME DOWN.
1991,01:07:05.17,01:07:05.17,AND THAT'S THE POINT IN THE GAME
1992,01:07:07.53,01:07:07.53,"WHERE I SAID, CHELSEA."
1993,01:07:09.17,01:07:09.17,YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GAME ALL
1994,01:07:10.37,01:07:10.37,WRONG.
1995,01:07:11.07,01:07:11.07,YOU HAVE TO CHECK YOURSELF OUT
1996,01:07:12.10,01:07:12.10,EMOTIONALLY OR YOU'RE NOT GOING
1997,01:07:12.90,01:07:12.90,TO MAKE IT IN THIS GAME.
1998,01:07:14.43,01:07:14.43,THAT'S WHEN I FEEL LIKE I BECAME
1999,01:07:16.73,01:07:16.73,"THE HARD-ASS, COLD-HEARTED"
2000,01:07:19.50,01:07:19.50,CHELSEA.
2001,01:07:20.20,01:07:20.20,THAT'S WHERE KIM AND I PLAYED
2002,01:07:21.10,01:07:21.10,THIS GAME DIFFERENTLY.
2003,01:07:22.33,01:07:22.33,MAYBE YOU'RE MORE MAD AT HER FOR
2004,01:07:23.93,01:07:23.93,WRITING YOUR NAME JUST BECAUSE
2005,01:07:25.27,01:07:25.27,SHE HAD MORE OF AN EMOTIONAL
2006,01:07:26.73,01:07:26.73,CONNECTION WITH MOST OF YOU THAN
2007,01:07:27.80,01:07:27.80,I DID.
2008,01:07:29.37,01:07:29.37,BUT I COULD HAVE BEEN SHOOTING
2009,01:07:31.63,01:07:31.63,MYSELF IN THE FOOT BECAUSE NOW
2010,01:07:32.93,01:07:32.93,"THAT I'M HERE, I'M LOOKING AT"
2011,01:07:34.33,01:07:34.33,"ALL OF YOU, AND I REALLY DON'T"
2012,01:07:35.80,01:07:35.80,FEEL LIKE I HAD THAT EMOTIONAL
2013,01:07:39.23,01:07:39.23,"CONNECTION, WHERE THAT MIGHT BE"
2014,01:07:40.43,01:07:40.43,HOW YOU VOTE.
2015,01:07:41.47,01:07:41.47,"I KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY,"
2016,01:07:43.10,01:07:43.10,"HOWEVER YOU GUYS DO IT, I'M 100%"
2017,01:07:45.70,01:07:45.70,"WITH YOU, AND TRUST HOWEVER YOU"
2018,01:07:49.10,01:07:49.10,VOTE.

2021,01:07:53.10,01:07:53.10,I'VE ALWAYS SEEN IT AS A GAME.
2022,01:07:54.93,01:07:54.93,"COMING INTO IT, I THOUGHT I SAW"
2023,01:07:56.83,01:07:56.83,"IT AS POKER, AND YOU DO"
2024,01:07:58.43,01:07:58.43,EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO TO SIT
2025,01:07:59.77,01:07:59.77,"HERE AT THE END OF THIS GAME, SO"
2026,01:08:01.63,01:08:01.63,THAT'S WHERE MY HEAD WAS WALKING
2027,01:08:03.17,01:08:03.17,INTO THIS.
2028,01:08:03.70,01:08:03.70,I THOUGHT NO RULES.
2029,01:08:04.70,01:08:04.70,I'M GOING TO COME IN AND I'M
2030,01:08:06.10,01:08:06.10,GOING TO PLAY AS HARD AS I
2031,01:08:08.10,01:08:08.10,POSSIBLY CAN.
2032,01:08:08.67,01:08:08.67,THAT'S ALL I KNOW TO DO.
2033,01:08:12.00,01:08:12.00,THE STRATEGIZED UNTIL I WAS BLUE
2034,01:08:14.43,01:08:14.43,IN THE FACE.
2035,01:08:15.37,01:08:15.37,I'M PROUD OF THE WAY I PLAYED IT
2036,01:08:18.70,01:08:18.70,STRATEGICALLY.
2037,01:08:19.40,01:08:19.40,I DON'T BE HOW I COULD HAVE DONE
2038,01:08:20.37,01:08:20.37,IT BETTER.
2039,01:08:21.03,01:08:21.03,EVERY TIME I CENT ONE OF YOU
2040,01:08:22.50,01:08:22.50,"HOME, THAT TOOK A TOLL ON ME AND"
2041,01:08:24.70,01:08:24.70,"THAT'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY HARD."
2042,01:08:26.63,01:08:26.63,BUST EVERY TIME I WAS TEMPTED TO
2043,01:08:28.10,01:08:28.10,MAKE A DECISION WITHIN THIS GAME
2044,01:08:29.13,01:08:29.13,I THOUGHT OF MY FAMILY BACK HOME
2045,01:08:30.63,01:08:30.63,AND THE THINGS YOU WANTED TO
2046,01:08:31.83,01:08:31.83,PROVIDE THEM WITH AND THE THINGS
2047,01:08:32.87,01:08:32.87,YOU WANTED TO DO WITH THE MONEY
2048,01:08:34.10,01:08:34.10,TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND HOW
2049,01:08:35.47,01:08:35.47,I'D KNOWN YOU ALL FOR 20 OR 30
2050,01:08:37.17,01:08:37.17,DAYS BUT HOW THEY'VE BEEN
2051,01:08:38.93,01:08:38.93,POURING THEMSELVES INTO ME FOR
2052,01:08:40.73,01:08:40.73,YEARS AND YEARS.
2053,01:08:41.43,01:08:41.43,SO I HOPE YOU ALL CAN FORGIVE
2054,01:08:43.37,01:08:43.37,ME.
2055,01:08:44.07,01:08:44.07,I HOPE YOU ALL CAN SEE IT AS A
2056,01:08:45.73,01:08:45.73,GAME.
2057,01:08:46.43,01:08:46.43,BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I CAME INTO
2058,01:08:47.37,01:08:47.37,IT.
2059,01:08:48.07,01:08:48.07,I CAN'T EVEN SAY I WOULD TAKE IT
2060,01:08:48.93,01:08:48.93,BACK BECAUSE MY END GOAL WAS TO
2061,01:08:50.83,01:08:50.83,SIT HERE AND I'M SITTING HERE
2062,01:08:53.47,01:08:53.47,TONIGHT.
2063,01:08:53.90,01:08:53.90,Jeff: SABRINA.

2067,01:09:00.03,01:09:00.03,WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
2068,01:09:01.10,01:09:01.10,OF HOW TO DO THINGS.
2069,01:09:02.47,01:09:02.47,SO MY STRATEGY COMING IN IS MUCH
2070,01:09:05.23,01:09:05.23,LIKE MY STRATEGY IN REAL LIFE.
2071,01:09:06.83,01:09:06.83,YOU HAVE TO HAVE BALANCE.
2072,01:09:08.70,01:09:08.70,"GUTO THE EXTREME ONE WAY, YOU'RE"
2073,01:09:10.00,01:09:10.00,GOING TO HAVE A TARGET ON YOUR

2075,01:09:12.20,01:09:12.20,I ALREADY KNEW I HAVE GOT TO
2076,01:09:13.80,01:09:13.80,SCALE BACK WHEN IT COMES TO
2077,01:09:15.23,01:09:15.23,PHYSICAL THINGS.
2078,01:09:15.90,01:09:15.90,THERE ARE SOME TIMES WHEN I
2079,01:09:17.93,01:09:17.93,"SURELY STEPPED DOWN, AND THAT"
2080,01:09:19.33,01:09:19.33,WAS PART OF MY STRATEGY.
2081,01:09:20.73,01:09:20.73,YOU GUYS SAW ME.
2082,01:09:22.37,01:09:22.37,I NEVER CAME BACK HERE WITH A

2087,01:09:29.37,01:09:29.37,"KIM, SHE AND OTHER PEOPLE WOULD"
2088,01:09:30.40,01:09:30.40,GO AHEAD AND SAY LET'S VOTE THIS

2091,01:09:34.90,01:09:34.90,LESS THE MESSENGERS.
2092,01:09:36.33,01:09:36.33,I CHOSE NOT TO STEP UP AND COME
2093,01:09:37.63,01:09:37.63,TO YOU FACE TO FACE BECAUSE AT
