7,00:00:28.43,00:00:28.43,the Amazon.
8,00:00:29.60,00:00:29.60," Spanning two and a half million miles,"
9,00:00:32.30,00:00:32.30, the Amazon is responsible for 15% of the world's oxygen
10,00:00:36.50,00:00:36.50, and is the world's largest freshwater source.
11,00:00:39.00,00:00:39.00," For much of the season,the Amazon is a flooded forest,"
12,00:00:42.27,00:00:42.27, a land covered by up to 60 feet of water.

20,00:01:04.73,00:01:04.73, and submerging the forest once again.
21,00:01:06.87,00:01:06.87,This will be their homefor the next 39 days.
22,00:01:13.77,00:01:13.77, It is the ultimate challenge.

27,00:01:27.90,00:01:27.90, while battling the elements and each other.
28,00:01:31.17,00:01:31.17,"They must learn to adapt, orthey'll be voted from the tribe."
29,00:01:33.70,00:01:33.70," In the end, only one will remain"
30,00:01:35.97,00:01:35.97, to claim the million-dollar prize.
31,00:01:43.60,00:01:43.60,"39 days, 16 people,one Survivor."
32,00:02:56.00,00:02:56.00,"PROBST: Okay, guys."

45,00:03:44.40,00:03:44.40,"like, instantly."
46,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50, This is an all-woman tribe.
47,00:03:46.73,00:03:46.73,Whoo!

57,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30, that it was an all-female tribe.
58,00:04:12.27,00:04:12.27, It's an all-chick thing.
59,00:04:14.07,00:04:14.07,We can let our hair down.
60,00:04:15.53,00:04:15.53,We can peein front of each other.
61,00:04:17.37,00:04:17.37," I'm on an equal playing field,"
62,00:04:19.53,00:04:19.53, because I have seven other people of the same sex.

67,00:04:31.10,00:04:31.10, But they don't have the strength.
68,00:04:32.90,00:04:32.90,They may have the will.
69,00:04:34.63,00:04:34.63,"But, you know--and this is a forbidden place."
70,00:04:36.80,00:04:36.80, It's pathetic.

82,00:05:09.97,00:05:09.97,"physical, mentally or whatever."
83,00:05:12.63,00:05:12.63, We're never going to go to Tribal Council.

91,00:05:30.20,00:05:30.20,Just want to tell you guys aquick story about how the Amazon
92,00:05:33.97,00:05:33.97,got its name.

96,00:05:45.37,00:05:45.37,"-(women cheer, chuckle)-Women only."
97,00:05:47.60,00:05:47.60,This was the first notionthat women could survive
98,00:05:50.07,00:05:50.07,just fine on their own.
99,00:05:51.57,00:05:51.57,So he named the Amazonafter these female warriors.
100,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,"That is where the term""Amazon women"" comes from."
101,00:05:58.97,00:05:58.97,"So, it is only fittingthat for the first time,"
102,00:06:01.77,00:06:01.77,"while we're here in the Amazon,"
103,00:06:02.93,00:06:02.93,we have a tribe of womenversus a tribe of men.

121,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23, couldn't even untie a boat.
122,00:07:12.37,00:07:12.37, And I just felt so stupid.
123,00:07:14.60,00:07:14.60,"The guys going off one way,the girls couldn't untie--"

131,00:07:35.60,00:07:35.60, it was taken and thrown all out the window.
132,00:07:37.63,00:07:37.63, It sucks when you have a game plan
133,00:07:39.30,00:07:39.30," that you, like, know that'll work."
134,00:07:40.97,00:07:40.97,"And now it's like,I got eight guys"

148,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67," If you're on a tribe with all women,"
149,00:08:21.03,00:08:21.03,you can't use any ofyour womanly powers on women.
150,00:08:24.87,00:08:24.87,They could care less.They find that insulting.

209,00:10:15.77,00:10:15.77,-All right.-We got to remember...
210,00:10:17.03,00:10:17.03,"-Yeah, careful, guys.-You got to be careful."
211,00:10:19.03,00:10:19.03,"Be careful with these machetes,all right?"
212,00:10:21.73,00:10:21.73,They can kill you.
213,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,"-Here, why don't you just...-Let's just go ahead"
214,00:10:25.73,00:10:25.73,-and start getting that out.-See what we got here.
215,00:10:27.40,00:10:27.40,"ROGER: We open the box,"
216,00:10:28.57,00:10:28.57,"and lo and behold, in the box,"
217,00:10:30.47,00:10:30.47,"there's the five gallonsof fresh water,"
218,00:10:32.93,00:10:32.93, there were fish hooks.
219,00:10:34.63,00:10:34.63,Fishing line and hooks.
220,00:10:36.70,00:10:36.70," There was kerosene,"
221,00:10:39.17,00:10:39.17, two lanterns.
222,00:10:40.93,00:10:40.93,There was a flint.
223,00:10:42.33,00:10:42.33,That's good to know.
224,00:10:44.87,00:10:44.87,What's this?
225,00:10:46.10,00:10:46.10,"Um, something we don'thave a key..."
226,00:10:47.30,00:10:47.30,ALEX: We have a mystery box.
227,00:10:48.73,00:10:48.73,We have a box that hada note on it that said...
228,00:10:51.10,00:10:51.10,"""Do not open tillinstructed..."
229,00:10:53.03,00:10:53.03,"A key will appearwhen you least expect it."""
230,00:10:55.43,00:10:55.43,All right.
231,00:10:56.43,00:10:56.43,So I don't know what that means.
232,00:10:58.43,00:10:58.43,"Um, but--so we, so we don't know"
233,00:11:00.17,00:11:00.17,what's in the mystery box yet.
234,00:11:01.43,00:11:01.43,Look at all this.
235,00:11:02.77,00:11:02.77,Manioc flour.
236,00:11:04.03,00:11:04.03," We got a big thing of manioc flour,"
237,00:11:05.67,00:11:05.67, and that stuff's actually
238,00:11:06.90,00:11:06.90,"got some pretty goodnutritional value, some--"
239,00:11:08.87,00:11:08.87,lots of carbohydrates and cankeep us going for a while.
240,00:11:10.70,00:11:10.70,And we got a huge thing of it.
241,00:11:12.37,00:11:12.37,"All right, let's huddle up."
242,00:11:14.50,00:11:14.50,"Let's, let's havea group huddle."
243,00:11:15.77,00:11:15.77,Everybody get together.
244,00:11:17.10,00:11:17.10,"Let's, let's get calm."
245,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,Let's get our machetes.
246,00:11:20.10,00:11:20.10,So cool. My parents wouldnever let me have a machete.
247,00:11:23.33,00:11:23.33,(chuckles)
248,00:11:33.13,00:11:33.13,"HEIDI: We were paddling away,"
249,00:11:35.47,00:11:35.47," and, uh, we finally see the yellow flag."
250,00:11:38.07,00:11:38.07,All right!
251,00:11:41.27,00:11:41.27,"I was so excited, so excited."
252,00:11:43.40,00:11:43.40,How we going to get up?
253,00:11:45.60,00:11:45.60,We can get out right here.
254,00:11:48.47,00:11:48.47,I got the slipknot rightthis time.
255,00:11:49.83,00:11:49.83,(chuckling)
256,00:11:50.93,00:11:50.93,"-All right.-Very nice, ladies."
257,00:11:52.63,00:11:52.63,Very good. Very good.
258,00:11:53.97,00:11:53.97,(whooping)
259,00:11:57.73,00:11:57.73,"All right, you guys, can I just"
260,00:11:59.93,00:11:59.93,-let you guys know something?-Yeah.
261,00:12:01.70,00:12:01.70,"Um, I-- it's not a big deal,"
262,00:12:04.37,00:12:04.37,"but I think it's something thatevery tribe member should know,"
263,00:12:07.00,00:12:07.00,and I want to try to do my best
264,00:12:08.23,00:12:08.23,"to keep it fromthe other tribe members,"
265,00:12:09.80,00:12:09.80,but I am deaf.
266,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,I can't hear.
267,00:12:13.10,00:12:13.10,I have a hearing aidin my one ear.
268,00:12:14.47,00:12:14.47,"Um, can't hear anythingout of this ear."
269,00:12:16.90,00:12:16.90,"Um, I read lips.Um, nighttime..."
270,00:12:18.60,00:12:18.60,JANET: Christy has a hearing disability.
271,00:12:20.50,00:12:20.50,"It took us by surprise, but she just asked us to look at her"
272,00:12:23.90,00:12:23.90,and speak slowlyso she could read our lips.
273,00:12:26.73,00:12:26.73,"You know, when we were on theboat and everyone was talking,"
274,00:12:29.10,00:12:29.10,"I have, like, no ideawhat your jobs are."
275,00:12:31.27,00:12:31.27,I have no idea what your namesare or where you guys live.
276,00:12:34.30,00:12:34.30,-Deena.-Deena?
277,00:12:35.47,00:12:35.47,"-Deena.-Hi, Deena."
278,00:12:36.53,00:12:36.53,-Jeanne.-Jeanne.
279,00:12:38.53,00:12:38.53,"CHRISTY: I kind of told them at the wrong time,"
280,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,but I needed to get itoff my chest.
281,00:12:43.30,00:12:43.30,"Like I just couldn't, like,keep it in any longer."
282,00:12:46.47,00:12:46.47,-Heidi.-Heidi.
283,00:12:47.73,00:12:47.73,-Jenna.-Jenna.
284,00:12:49.30,00:12:49.30,JENNA: I'm just wondering how she's going to be able
285,00:12:51.57,00:12:51.57, to work with a group when she can't really hear well.
286,00:12:54.87,00:12:54.87,-I'm Janet.-Jan.
287,00:12:56.90,00:12:56.90,"I don't know how it's goingto work out, I really don't."
288,00:12:59.50,00:12:59.50,"Well, that's all."
289,00:13:00.57,00:13:00.57,I just kind of wanted...
290,00:13:01.70,00:13:01.70,"No, that's important."
291,00:13:02.87,00:13:02.87,-I'm glad you told usright off the bat. -I know.
292,00:13:04.97,00:13:04.97,We promise not to tellthe boys anything.
293,00:13:07.73,00:13:07.73,Let's see if we've got any food.Is anybody else...?
294,00:13:25.03,00:13:25.03,"Yeah, we want to be quite a waysfrom the water."
295,00:13:27.63,00:13:27.63,The higher up we go-- what doyou guys think about that?
296,00:13:29.40,00:13:29.40,I'm asking your opinion.
297,00:13:30.73,00:13:30.73,That pretty much agreewith everybody?
298,00:13:32.07,00:13:32.07,"The higher up we go,better off we are, too?"
299,00:13:34.07,00:13:34.07,"Not... well, but we also wantto be able to get to water."
300,00:13:36.17,00:13:36.17,How about if we walk aroundand then we come back
301,00:13:37.90,00:13:37.90,"and share opinions,you know, so--"
302,00:13:39.53,00:13:39.53,Nobody wants to be a leader'cause that's the first guy
303,00:13:41.30,00:13:41.30,"gets voted off, right?"
304,00:13:42.57,00:13:42.57,(laughter)
305,00:13:43.60,00:13:43.60,"So, why don't we come back--"
306,00:13:45.60,00:13:45.60,And here I am saying that. Uh...
307,00:13:47.87,00:13:47.87,ROB: Maybe you think you meet a guy named Butch
308,00:13:49.43,00:13:49.43,from Illinois that's a redneck.
309,00:13:52.43,00:13:52.43,"You think he's notthat sharp a guy, but he is."
310,00:13:55.00,00:13:55.00,I like Butch a lot.
311,00:13:59.77,00:13:59.77,ALEX: We found a great spot.
312,00:14:01.33,00:14:01.33,"We found a pretty, you know,relatively level spot"
313,00:14:03.50,00:14:03.50,on a little bit higher ground.
314,00:14:05.00,00:14:05.00,What if we would usethose two trees
315,00:14:08.13,00:14:08.13,as the back part of your hut
316,00:14:09.77,00:14:09.77,and bring something across?I don't know...
317,00:14:11.67,00:14:11.67,ALEX: We don't even needto bring anything across.
318,00:14:13.67,00:14:13.67,We can just clear that branch.
319,00:14:14.60,00:14:14.60,"It's already cleared, too, guys."
320,00:14:16.07,00:14:16.07,"ALEX: And, actually, there's a little bit of a slope, too,"
321,00:14:17.67,00:14:17.67,"to where we are,so the water won't-won't"
322,00:14:20.33,00:14:20.33,puddle up where we are.
323,00:14:21.70,00:14:21.70,-So we got to get these logsout. -Right.
324,00:14:23.87,00:14:23.87,"Let's not get everybodydoing it, though, you know?"
325,00:14:25.40,00:14:25.40,Two of us are going to go dothe fire situation.
326,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,I think probably...
327,00:14:29.40,00:14:29.40,"Well, two can start clearing,"
328,00:14:31.03,00:14:31.03,"two can start, uh,trying to find palms for..."
329,00:14:33.10,00:14:33.10,"Well, actually, you know what?We don't need to"
330,00:14:35.03,00:14:35.03,do that till tomorrow.We just need a floor.
331,00:14:36.30,00:14:36.30,"-Alex, tonight, we're only goingto get a platform. -Yeah, we..."
332,00:14:37.43,00:14:37.43,-Okay?-Let's do it.
333,00:14:38.53,00:14:38.53,We got trees right herethat'll work.
334,00:14:57.00,00:14:57.00,That's good.
335,00:15:05.50,00:15:05.50,It's all goodin the neighborhood.
336,00:15:07.83,00:15:07.83,"It's all gravy, baby."
337,00:15:09.30,00:15:09.30,I feel I missed my callingin life as a lumberjack.
338,00:15:12.67,00:15:12.67,Tell me if this is not kerosene.
339,00:15:14.67,00:15:14.67,That's kerosene;I can smell it from here.
340,00:15:16.57,00:15:16.57,"Okay, yeah, 'cause my smelleris gone; I can't tell you."
341,00:15:19.70,00:15:19.70,Yeah. Whew.
342,00:15:20.70,00:15:20.70,"You can tell by,you can tell by..."
343,00:15:22.23,00:15:22.23,"-By the crossbones, yeah.-(laughter)"
344,00:15:24.23,00:15:24.23,DAVE: Making the fire was-was a piece of cake.
345,00:15:27.73,00:15:27.73,The reason beingis that there was
346,00:15:28.97,00:15:28.97,"kerosene in the, in the lamps."
347,00:15:30.50,00:15:30.50, We were also given some flint with the machetes
348,00:15:33.73,00:15:33.73, and had no problems making a fire.
349,00:15:35.70,00:15:35.70,"-There you go.-You got it, you got it."
350,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,"Keep going, man."
351,00:15:39.20,00:15:39.20,-There you go. Perfect-Turn it.
352,00:15:40.67,00:15:40.67,Yeah. Toss that right on top.
353,00:15:43.03,00:15:43.03,Nice. Nice.
354,00:15:44.80,00:15:44.80,I wonder if the chickshave built their fire yet.
355,00:15:46.70,00:15:46.70,-I doubt it.-Probably.
356,00:15:50.20,00:15:50.20,I don't smoke...
357,00:15:51.23,00:15:51.23,"Come on, come on.Somebody do something."
358,00:15:52.47,00:15:52.47,"-Something.-Here, here, here."
359,00:15:53.83,00:15:53.83,"-Blow.-Here, here."
360,00:15:55.07,00:15:55.07,I need one of those big leaves.
361,00:15:56.67,00:15:56.67,Let's just fan it.
362,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,I fanned it.
363,00:16:04.73,00:16:04.73,Yep.
364,00:16:06.00,00:16:06.00,Keep going.
365,00:16:16.40,00:16:16.40,We almost got it.
366,00:16:20.23,00:16:20.23,SHAWNA: The fire was an absolute fiasco.
367,00:16:22.60,00:16:22.60, The process was:
368,00:16:23.90,00:16:23.90,"get the little fire going,put on some leaves,"
369,00:16:26.30,00:16:26.30,"some other small stuff,"
370,00:16:27.87,00:16:27.87,"put on little sticks,put on bigger stuff,"
371,00:16:30.27,00:16:30.27,put on big logs.
372,00:16:31.63,00:16:31.63,-I think it stopped.-It's going out.
373,00:16:33.20,00:16:33.20,-(gasps)-Yeah.
374,00:16:34.30,00:16:34.30,It's going out. Why?
375,00:16:35.67,00:16:35.67,"-It's this stuff.-Blow, blow."
376,00:16:37.13,00:16:37.13,SHAWNA: None of this happened.
377,00:16:38.60,00:16:38.60, It was ridiculous.
378,00:16:40.20,00:16:40.20,"Obviously, it's a lack of fire-building skills on our part."
379,00:16:45.57,00:16:45.57,It's dead.
380,00:16:46.63,00:16:46.63,What is doing that?
381,00:16:48.40,00:16:48.40,"Hey, guys, we need to havea little team meeting."
382,00:16:51.23,00:16:51.23,We need to decidewhat's really important
383,00:16:53.53,00:16:53.53,"for this first night here,on this bug-infested,"
384,00:16:55.90,00:16:55.90,"fly-infested,wasp-infested area."
385,00:16:58.63,00:16:58.63,"For me, it is somethingto sleep on."
386,00:17:00.93,00:17:00.93,So how would you suggestwe do that?
387,00:17:03.20,00:17:03.20,HEIDI: Deena-- she definitely has
388,00:17:04.70,00:17:04.70, more of a bossy side to her.
389,00:17:05.93,00:17:05.93," Like, if six of us"
390,00:17:07.30,00:17:07.30,"come up with a good idea,she would be the one to say,"
391,00:17:09.93,00:17:09.93,"""I don't think that'll work;we better do something else."""
392,00:17:12.13,00:17:12.13,I don't wantto sleep on the floor.
393,00:17:14.53,00:17:14.53,We could split.
394,00:17:15.70,00:17:15.70,"Just, like, half do fire,half do shelter."
395,00:17:18.33,00:17:18.33,So let's split.
396,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,-Half will work on the fire...-I'll work on the shelter.
397,00:17:20.73,00:17:20.73,and get the logsready for the fire--
398,00:17:22.50,00:17:22.50,the other halfwork on the shelter?
399,00:17:24.53,00:17:24.53,-Yeah.-Okay.
400,00:17:31.87,00:17:31.87,Timber. Clear.
401,00:17:37.43,00:17:37.43,It's stuck.
402,00:17:42.33,00:17:42.33,Ah...
403,00:17:46.47,00:17:46.47,JEANNE: It's okay.
404,00:17:47.47,00:17:47.47,We're Amazon women.
405,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,We'll make it.
406,00:17:51.10,00:17:51.10,Go...
407,00:17:52.10,00:17:52.10,(grunts)
408,00:17:53.63,00:17:53.63,"Oh, my God."
409,00:17:55.70,00:17:55.70, We'll toughen up and we'll make it through to the end.
410,00:17:57.70,00:17:57.70,Kick the guys' butt.
411,00:18:10.13,00:18:10.13,"RYAN: Hey, guys, what do youthink of our bed, dude?"
412,00:18:12.03,00:18:12.03,All right.
413,00:18:13.17,00:18:13.17,"Hey, that looks a..."
414,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,-That looks pretty damncomfortable. -Look at the bed!
415,00:18:16.77,00:18:16.77,How is it?
416,00:18:18.23,00:18:18.23,Not... not bad.
417,00:18:20.30,00:18:20.30,Butch has got his...
418,00:18:21.97,00:18:21.97,"Here's my, um,here's my thing that I got."
419,00:18:24.27,00:18:24.27,"And it, it, uh--I wanted to explain it to you,"
420,00:18:26.03,00:18:26.03,'cause it's kind of corny.
421,00:18:27.23,00:18:27.23,"Uh, I'm in the kid business,and I have--"
422,00:18:29.27,00:18:29.27,I deal with 500middle school kids every day.
423,00:18:31.03,00:18:31.03,And I have a lot of kidsnowadays that are not like us.
424,00:18:33.37,00:18:33.37,They're not dreamers.
425,00:18:34.37,00:18:34.37,They have no goals.
426,00:18:35.87,00:18:35.87,And they just don'tbelieve in themselves.
427,00:18:37.83,00:18:37.83,"So I had a bannerhanging up in my school,"
428,00:18:39.80,00:18:39.80,and I brought the banner.
429,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,"And it says, each one of us..."
430,00:18:42.33,00:18:42.33,"""Believe In Yourself."""
431,00:18:44.07,00:18:44.07,-I'm down.-Put it up!
432,00:18:45.60,00:18:45.60,DAVE: Butch had a fantastic luxury item.
433,00:18:47.43,00:18:47.43,"It's a fabulous motto, you know?"
434,00:18:49.67,00:18:49.67,"It's something to,"
435,00:18:50.77,00:18:50.77, to really think about.
436,00:18:52.03,00:18:52.03,"Hey, believe in yourself, right?"
437,00:18:54.50,00:18:54.50,"One, two, three..."
438,00:18:55.50,00:18:55.50,ALL:Believe in yourself!
439,00:18:56.77,00:18:56.77,-Hoorah!-Believe in yourself.
440,00:18:57.93,00:18:57.93,Tambaqui.
441,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,-Tambaqui?-It's Tambaqui!
442,00:19:01.00,00:19:01.00,"If it rained, we could coverthe wood with this."
443,00:19:03.60,00:19:03.60,"ROB: I think, as a whole, we've gotten along very well,"
444,00:19:07.10,00:19:07.10,but I think that the womenhave got to be having
445,00:19:09.40,00:19:09.40,a very difficult time.
446,00:19:11.47,00:19:11.47," And especially, they're not going to catch any fish."
447,00:19:13.67,00:19:13.67, We got expert fishermen out there
448,00:19:15.20,00:19:15.20, and we haven't caught anything yet.
449,00:19:16.50,00:19:16.50, I don't think any of them had any idea
450,00:19:19.23,00:19:19.23, they'd be doing this on estrogen alone
451,00:19:21.53,00:19:21.53,"over there in, in, uh,Camp of the Vagina Monologue."
452,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17,"By tomorrow night,we'll be light-years ahead of"
453,00:19:28.77,00:19:28.77,where they are.
454,00:19:29.90,00:19:29.90,There is no waythat that group collectively
455,00:19:32.27,00:19:32.27,is halfway where we are.
456,00:19:34.23,00:19:34.23,I just can't see it.
457,00:19:45.57,00:19:45.57,Blow on it.
458,00:19:46.57,00:19:46.57,Blow on it.
459,00:19:48.33,00:19:48.33,-There we go.-All right.
460,00:19:50.00,00:19:50.00,"Oh, you're a lifesaverwith this one."
461,00:19:51.87,00:19:51.87,DEENA: It took us five or six hours
462,00:19:54.50,00:19:54.50, to get the fire really going.
463,00:19:56.33,00:19:56.33," And by the time it got pitch black,"
464,00:19:58.03,00:19:58.03, we had really only cut four logs.
465,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10," So we all sat there in front of the fire,"
466,00:20:03.67,00:20:03.67,which was now startingto grow a little bit larger;
467,00:20:05.83,00:20:05.83,people were a little bitmore comfortable.
468,00:20:07.27,00:20:07.27,We lighted the keroseneso it wouldn't be
469,00:20:08.93,00:20:08.93,quite so dark out there.
470,00:20:10.07,00:20:10.07,-What is that?-What?
471,00:20:11.97,00:20:11.97,See it.
472,00:20:13.03,00:20:13.03,-What is it?-It's a leaf.
473,00:20:14.77,00:20:14.77,See the shadow of the leaf?
474,00:20:16.00,00:20:16.00,"No, go a little further."
475,00:20:17.10,00:20:17.10,I'm telling you.
476,00:20:18.10,00:20:18.10,It's the shadow of the leaf.
477,00:20:20.00,00:20:20.00," DEENA: We huddled as close to the fire as we could,"
478,00:20:22.07,00:20:22.07, and we decided that we were going to
479,00:20:23.67,00:20:23.67, watch the fire in shifts that night.
480,00:20:25.33,00:20:25.33,But all we did was a majorbag fest on the boy team
481,00:20:29.10,00:20:29.10,for most of the night.
482,00:20:30.73,00:20:30.73,-The boys are talking about...-How they get off.
483,00:20:32.87,00:20:32.87,-(laughter)-Oh!
484,00:20:34.47,00:20:34.47,What are they talking about?
485,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,They're talking abouthow they can't believe
486,00:20:37.50,00:20:37.50,that you two aren'tin your bathing suits.
487,00:20:39.10,00:20:39.10,Did you notice the guysstaring at Heidi
488,00:20:40.80,00:20:40.80,when they got on the boat?
489,00:20:42.10,00:20:42.10,"He was like--it was, like, a long..."
490,00:20:43.27,00:20:43.27,(laughter)
491,00:20:44.10,00:20:44.10,"Just like, ""No!"
492,00:20:45.50,00:20:45.50,"Don't take her from me."""
493,00:20:47.20,00:20:47.20,"""I wanted to look atyour hooters all day."""
494,00:20:48.53,00:20:48.53,(laughter)
495,00:20:50.43,00:20:50.43,"CHRISTY: As soon as it gets dark,"
496,00:20:53.63,00:20:53.63," that's where my whole communication just shuts down,"
497,00:20:57.80,00:20:57.80, because I can't see.
498,00:21:00.17,00:21:00.17, I can't read their lips.
499,00:21:06.17,00:21:06.17," And it's, like, God, of course"
500,00:21:07.93,00:21:07.93,I'm in a group of girlswho like to
501,00:21:09.80,00:21:09.80,"talk and talk and talk and talk,you know?"
502,00:21:12.30,00:21:12.30,So it's like...
503,00:21:14.13,00:21:14.13,So I'm missing outon a lot of their information.
504,00:21:17.07,00:21:17.07,"We want to eat,or do we want a shelter?"
505,00:21:19.07,00:21:19.07,"I think we better eat, orwe're going to start collapsing."
506,00:21:21.73,00:21:21.73,"CHRISTY:  I'll try to be with them,"
507,00:21:23.23,00:21:23.23, but I can never be like them 'cause I'm not.
508,00:21:26.33,00:21:26.33, I'm always totally different.
509,00:21:28.33,00:21:28.33, It always happens.
510,00:21:29.67,00:21:29.67,That's okay. That's okay.
511,00:21:31.90,00:21:31.90,It happens every time.
512,00:21:33.40,00:21:33.40,"It's just like,I'm at a big disadvantage."
513,00:21:38.63,00:21:38.63,"Oh, no!"
514,00:21:39.70,00:21:39.70,"I said, ""No!Are you out of your mind?"""
515,00:21:41.57,00:21:41.57,"I'm not eating someone else's,like, order."
516,00:21:45.10,00:21:45.10,(chuckles)
517,00:21:46.40,00:21:46.40,Is Christy sleeping over there?
518,00:21:47.90,00:21:47.90,"-Yeah, she is. She's out.-Is she?"
519,00:21:50.50,00:21:50.50,"-Night, ladies.-Good night."
520,00:21:51.87,00:21:51.87,-Good night.-How you feeling?
521,00:22:11.13,00:22:11.13,JENNA: The Amazon women tribe is not doing very well.
522,00:22:14.83,00:22:14.83," We slept on the ground, which is, like, the number one rule"
523,00:22:17.40,00:22:17.40, not to do in the jungle.
524,00:22:18.97,00:22:18.97, And it was awful.
525,00:22:20.57,00:22:20.57, We had bugs crawling all over us.
526,00:22:22.93,00:22:22.93,Something was always biting you
527,00:22:24.40,00:22:24.40,or crawling down your pantsor crawling in your hair.
528,00:22:26.77,00:22:26.77,I don't like when they flydirectly into your eyeball.
529,00:22:29.50,00:22:29.50,Or right up your nose.I had that this morning.
530,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07,"Yeah, I saw that."
531,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,"JANET:There was leeches, big spiders."
532,00:22:35.50,00:22:35.50,We all got bit.
533,00:22:39.23,00:22:39.23,"Here, give me the machete."
534,00:22:40.43,00:22:40.43,"Oh, my goodness."
535,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,"I can't believethat's right there,"
536,00:22:43.30,00:22:43.30,and we've beensleeping right there.
537,00:22:44.57,00:22:44.57,"Maybe if we just leave it alone,it'll go away."
538,00:22:46.60,00:22:46.60,"No, I want it dead."
539,00:22:48.17,00:22:48.17,That's a reality check.
540,00:22:49.73,00:22:49.73,"Last night,that big spider dropped down."
541,00:22:51.50,00:22:51.50,"Oh, you're right."
542,00:22:52.50,00:22:52.50,And it was something huge.
543,00:22:53.80,00:22:53.80,JENNA: We found a tarantula that morning.
544,00:22:56.17,00:22:56.17, It fell on someone that night.
545,00:22:57.67,00:22:57.67,"So, obviously, it probablyclimbed over all of us."
546,00:22:59.33,00:22:59.33,Just get it.
547,00:23:00.40,00:23:00.40,"It's in the food now, girls."
548,00:23:02.40,00:23:02.40,-Oh... -It went into our stuff;that's what it's after.
549,00:23:04.23,00:23:04.23,"Oh, he went into the food."
550,00:23:05.47,00:23:05.47,-Maybe the net.-Is he in there? Really?
551,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,He's right there.
552,00:23:08.70,00:23:08.70,"Oh, step away."
553,00:23:09.70,00:23:09.70,It's hollow though underneath.
554,00:23:11.13,00:23:11.13,"-He's probably underneath it.-Well, that's okay."
555,00:23:12.57,00:23:12.57,"-Okay, he is. -Lift it up.-Who's got the machete?"
556,00:23:14.17,00:23:14.17,-Here.-Are you ready?
557,00:23:15.80,00:23:15.80,Don't both of youhit each other.
558,00:23:17.70,00:23:17.70,-Wow!-I got him.
559,00:23:18.93,00:23:18.93,"-Oh, yay!-Put him in the fire."
560,00:23:20.70,00:23:20.70,All right.
561,00:23:21.87,00:23:21.87,"Whoo, Ja-ru!"
562,00:23:22.90,00:23:22.90,All right.
563,00:23:24.00,00:23:24.00,(excited chatter)
564,00:23:27.13,00:23:27.13,CHRISTY: We were sleeping on that ground.
565,00:23:29.30,00:23:29.30,Wow.
566,00:23:30.53,00:23:30.53,(laughs)
567,00:23:31.97,00:23:31.97,Makes you wonderwhat went in your mouth.
568,00:23:35.00,00:23:35.00,We don't even have to makeour own
569,00:23:36.10,00:23:36.10,stinking fishing line.Look at that.
570,00:23:37.23,00:23:37.23,"DEENA: I think all of usrealized that it was cold, wet,"
571,00:23:40.37,00:23:40.37," miserable and uncomfortable, and there's bugs, so first and"
572,00:23:44.23,00:23:44.23,"foremost,we needed to get a shelter."
573,00:23:46.33,00:23:46.33,We could do it in shifts.
574,00:23:48.33,00:23:48.33,"Six and two--like, six on the shelter"
575,00:23:49.90,00:23:49.90,and two at-at food gatheringor something.
576,00:23:52.90,00:23:52.90,Everybody readyto go check this out?
577,00:23:54.07,00:23:54.07,"-Wait a minute.No, we're missing Heidi. -Yeah."
578,00:23:55.63,00:23:55.63,"-She's coming.-Oh, we're still missing Heidi?"
579,00:23:57.40,00:23:57.40,Are you good?
580,00:23:58.40,00:23:58.40,"Okay. Sorry, girls."
581,00:24:00.57,00:24:00.57,All right.
582,00:24:00.87,00:24:00.87,"So we go backto the boat, right?"
583,00:24:11.73,00:24:11.73,"CHRISTY: They all kind of started to have this, like,"
584,00:24:14.23,00:24:14.23," mission or whatever, and I was like, man, what's going on?"
585,00:24:17.27,00:24:17.27," I'm like, okay, I'll watch the fire."
586,00:24:19.23,00:24:19.23," And at the same time, I was like,"
587,00:24:20.90,00:24:20.90,"""Well, doesn't anybody care"
588,00:24:23.03,00:24:23.03,"that I'm the only oneout here, you know?"""
589,00:24:28.57,00:24:28.57,HEIDI: I haven't really bonded with Christy
590,00:24:31.60,00:24:31.60, just because of the communication barrier.
591,00:24:34.30,00:24:34.30,"If you can't understandall the people around you,"
592,00:24:37.47,00:24:37.47,it's hard to makethat communication.
593,00:24:39.47,00:24:39.47,So that-that is definitelymore of a liability right now.
594,00:24:45.70,00:24:45.70,CHRISTY: It's not like this is new to me.
595,00:24:48.47,00:24:48.47, This is what a deaf person has to go through.
596,00:24:51.30,00:24:51.30, It's an everyday struggle.
597,00:24:53.87,00:24:53.87, But I don't want it to be an issue every day.
598,00:24:57.30,00:24:57.30,"'Cause if it becomesan issue every day,"
599,00:24:59.07,00:24:59.07,"then they're going to be like,"

604,00:25:19.27,00:25:19.27,"These two, maybe,as the front of our shelter"
605,00:25:21.53,00:25:21.53,and built back that way.
606,00:25:23.37,00:25:23.37,"Yeah, this is the backand that is the front."
607,00:25:25.37,00:25:25.37,-Put two posts here.-Yeah.
608,00:25:26.60,00:25:26.60,"We put in, uh,"

610,00:25:32.07,00:25:32.07,-and we just do the floors.-We need them about

612,00:25:34.83,00:25:34.83,And there should beplenty of them.
613,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,"You just see a tree.They're all over, like--"
614,00:25:37.40,00:25:37.40,"There's one with a ""Y."""
615,00:25:38.63,00:25:38.63,"They don't have to bereal strong at the fork,"
616,00:25:40.70,00:25:40.70,"but we got to have those ""Y's."""
617,00:25:42.00,00:25:42.00,-Right.-Okay?
618,00:25:43.07,00:25:43.07,ROB:Roger definitely is very bossy.
619,00:25:44.40,00:25:44.40," You know, when we were building the shelter,"
620,00:25:45.90,00:25:45.90," he's telling people, and especially telling kids,"
621,00:25:48.10,00:25:48.10," which is mostly this tribe,"
622,00:25:49.47,00:25:49.47,"uh, you know, telling them,""Go do this, go do that."""
623,00:25:52.70,00:25:52.70,"Ryan, you want tostoke that fire out,"
624,00:25:55.50,00:25:55.50,"check that water,see if it's boiling, please."
625,00:25:58.13,00:25:58.13,ROB: I know how to play this game.
626,00:26:00.30,00:26:00.30,"I say, ""Yes, Roger. Yes, Roger. Sure, Roger."""
627,00:26:04.70,00:26:04.70,I just go and do it.
628,00:26:06.20,00:26:06.20,"But, uh, it doesn't-doesn'tbother me too much."
629,00:26:08.27,00:26:08.27,"Why don't we stay,keep it tight on this end,"
630,00:26:10.57,00:26:10.57,"and then as we keep--as we taper out,"
631,00:26:13.00,00:26:13.00,-Yeah. -we'll just putmore on that side.
632,00:26:15.00,00:26:15.00,Yeah. We'll worryabout it later.
633,00:26:19.03,00:26:19.03,"ROGER: This kid Ryan and the kid Daniel,"
634,00:26:21.70,00:26:21.70,"uh, they're justnot contributing."
635,00:26:24.53,00:26:24.53," You know, you ask them to do stuff and they just--"
636,00:26:27.00,00:26:27.00, they're talking to each other
637,00:26:28.23,00:26:28.23, and they're just floating around.
638,00:26:29.47,00:26:29.47,"Well, y-your two boyshaven't even moved."
639,00:26:33.27,00:26:33.27,I've already made up my mindon that score.
640,00:26:35.47,00:26:35.47,(laughter)
641,00:26:37.13,00:26:37.13," And building the shelter, these guys--"
642,00:26:38.60,00:26:38.60,"we asked them to go outand get some vines,"
643,00:26:40.37,00:26:40.37,"and, I mean, it's likepulling, pulling teeth."
644,00:26:42.37,00:26:42.37,"One, two, three."
645,00:26:44.80,00:26:44.80,(groaning)
646,00:26:46.97,00:26:46.97, They're just useless.
647,00:26:48.10,00:26:48.10, They're digging their own grave.
648,00:26:49.30,00:26:49.30, They've already dug it.
649,00:26:53.63,00:26:53.63,"Whew, that's, that'slooking good right there."
650,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,A little sun's coming down.
651,00:26:58.57,00:26:58.57,It's gonna bea lot better than that.
652,00:27:00.37,00:27:00.37,"We built an interesting--we're calling it, um,"
653,00:27:02.53,00:27:02.53,our postmodern survivorfor survival shelter.
654,00:27:05.60,00:27:05.60, It's not a perfect square.
655,00:27:06.70,00:27:06.70, We got a little trapezoid action going
656,00:27:07.93,00:27:07.93, and some different planes.
657,00:27:09.60,00:27:09.60," It's gonna be, it's gonna be very nice."
658,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,I think I'm reallyrelatively sure
659,00:27:13.40,00:27:13.40, Home and Garden is gonnacome and shoot us later.
660,00:27:15.93,00:27:15.93,"I just think about what thegirls are going through, man."
661,00:27:18.67,00:27:18.67,I find it really hard to believethat they're doing this.
662,00:27:20.63,00:27:20.63,"I mean, and they might be,they probably are, but..."
663,00:27:22.30,00:27:22.30," I don't know, man."
664,00:27:23.50,00:27:23.50,I-I can't imagine them actually
665,00:27:25.23,00:27:25.23,dismantling the junglelike we have
666,00:27:26.67,00:27:26.67,and actually building shelter.
667,00:27:30.10,00:27:30.10,ROB: I don't see the women working well together.
668,00:27:32.20,00:27:32.20, I know that their shelter is not going to be
669,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83, as good as ours.
670,00:27:35.13,00:27:35.13," I see them all crying and panicking,"
671,00:27:37.27,00:27:37.27,"trying to build a,build a cell phone so they can"
672,00:27:40.40,00:27:40.40,call their boyfriendsto come over
673,00:27:42.00,00:27:42.00,"and help them build,build the shelter."
674,00:27:43.90,00:27:43.90," Outside of that, I'm sure they've got"
675,00:27:45.47,00:27:45.47, maybe three sticks together.
676,00:27:46.73,00:27:46.73,ALL:Tambaqui!
677,00:27:47.90,00:27:47.90,(cheering)
678,00:27:49.73,00:27:49.73,Like the eight musketeers.
679,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,(indistinct voices)
680,00:28:03.47,00:28:03.47,Right there.
681,00:28:06.50,00:28:06.50,-(groans)-Push it down.
682,00:28:07.83,00:28:07.83,-We're gonna try to...-Okay.
683,00:28:09.07,00:28:09.07,Put another one under it?
684,00:28:10.40,00:28:10.40,"Oh, like, under which part?"
685,00:28:12.30,00:28:12.30,"Oh, she's tryingto fill that in."
686,00:28:13.77,00:28:13.77,We need big holes for those.
687,00:28:15.13,00:28:15.13,"Oh, okay,I see what you're saying."
688,00:28:16.50,00:28:16.50,JEANNE:I thought we'd be more focused.
689,00:28:18.47,00:28:18.47, I thought someone would take the leadership role.
690,00:28:20.23,00:28:20.23,"But, you know,this is in here pretty sturdy."
691,00:28:22.23,00:28:22.23,We may have to adjustthat middle one
692,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,'cause it's in here pretty good.
693,00:28:24.47,00:28:24.47," But we look disorganized,"
694,00:28:25.47,00:28:25.47,and we're not functioning well.
695,00:28:26.80,00:28:26.80," And considering the group we have,"
696,00:28:29.33,00:28:29.33,"it's embarrassing, I think."
697,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10,Downright embarrassing.
698,00:28:32.43,00:28:32.43,"We might be able to dosomething like that, you know?"
699,00:28:39.23,00:28:39.23,Is the water done?
700,00:28:40.73,00:28:40.73,No.
701,00:28:41.73,00:28:41.73, Everyone's dehydrated.
702,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,No one wentto the bathroom yesterday.
703,00:28:45.73,00:28:45.73, People are going to start getting down.
704,00:28:51.50,00:28:51.50,JENNA: The flies are swarming us because we stink.
705,00:28:54.40,00:28:54.40," So we boiled our buffs,"
706,00:28:56.30,00:28:56.30, we boiled underwear that wasn't clean.
707,00:28:59.50,00:28:59.50,Underwear needs to be clean.
708,00:29:01.07,00:29:01.07,I figure-- I thinkit's a priority because of...
709,00:29:04.07,00:29:04.07,"it's, you know, it's--things can live on you,"
710,00:29:06.80,00:29:06.80,especially in that area'cause it's dark.
711,00:29:10.97,00:29:10.97,They should be cooled down alittle bit more than these ones
712,00:29:13.70,00:29:13.70,'cause I took them outa little while ago.
713,00:29:15.83,00:29:15.83,DEENA: We're having a difficult time
714,00:29:17.73,00:29:17.73," getting our tasks in order,"
715,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17, completing them and moving on to the next project.
716,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67," It's a ""I'm kind of feeling like"
717,00:29:24.23,00:29:24.23," I need to wash my buff now,"" so we wash the buffs."
718,00:29:28.73,00:29:28.73,I'm thinking shelter.
719,00:29:31.23,00:29:31.23,CHRISTY:Somebody boiled water.
720,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,I don't knowwhat it was boiled for.
721,00:29:35.27,00:29:35.27,I think they boiled itto wash their clothes in.
722,00:29:37.67,00:29:37.67,I think it was for clothes.
723,00:29:40.07,00:29:40.07,'Cause you knowit's a priority here.
724,00:29:42.20,00:29:42.20,"Got to have fresh, fresh buffs."
725,00:29:44.83,00:29:44.83,And panties.
726,00:29:45.97,00:29:45.97,CHRISTY:Whatever.
727,00:29:47.37,00:29:47.37,Buffs.
728,00:29:53.40,00:29:53.40,(sighs):Hoy.
729,00:30:05.47,00:30:05.47,(thunder rumbling softly)
730,00:30:13.33,00:30:13.33,"Man, this thing is just heavy."
731,00:30:15.40,00:30:15.40,-I know.-Wow.
732,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,Okay...
733,00:30:19.03,00:30:19.03,There's a breeze here.
734,00:30:22.30,00:30:22.30,"JENNA: Me and Heidi and Janet went fishing, using the net."
735,00:30:25.83,00:30:25.83, And Janet--
736,00:30:26.83,00:30:26.83,she's very sick.
737,00:30:28.20,00:30:28.20,She's not doing well at all.
738,00:30:29.87,00:30:29.87,I'm about ready to pass out.
739,00:30:31.00,00:30:31.00,(Jenna murmurs)
740,00:30:32.10,00:30:32.10,I'm not going to make itto a challenge
741,00:30:34.33,00:30:34.33,or anything else if I don't...
742,00:30:36.13,00:30:36.13,This is too hard.
743,00:30:37.13,00:30:37.13,We can't live on that stuff.
744,00:30:38.77,00:30:38.77,That's just not going to work.
745,00:30:46.30,00:30:46.30,JENNA: She just kind of did nothing.
746,00:30:48.80,00:30:48.80, She just kind of sat there on the boat and just said
747,00:30:51.40,00:30:51.40, she didn't want to paddle out far because
748,00:30:53.70,00:30:53.70,she didn't wantto have to paddle far back.
749,00:30:55.43,00:30:55.43,"It's just...it's-it's, like, up and down."
750,00:30:57.87,00:30:57.87,"I mean, she's mostly down."
751,00:30:59.43,00:30:59.43, And that's probably really going to hurt her.
752,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33," If we lose the challenge, she might go."
753,00:31:03.03,00:31:03.03,I've had it. I can't...
754,00:31:04.70,00:31:04.70,You get a nice vacation.
755,00:31:05.87,00:31:05.87,I can't do this anymore.
756,00:31:07.27,00:31:07.27,JANET: I hit rock bottom today.
757,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,"You know, we were going out"
758,00:31:10.80,00:31:10.80,"to fish or whatever,which is silly."
759,00:31:12.23,00:31:12.23,"It's not-- you know,we're not successful at it."
760,00:31:14.07,00:31:14.07,"Oh, look, we caught a leaf."
761,00:31:17.20,00:31:17.20,"Oh, great."
762,00:31:18.93,00:31:18.93,"Man, the toughest partabout this whole experience,"
763,00:31:21.53,00:31:21.53,I didn't realize how toughit was physically.
764,00:31:23.77,00:31:23.77, I think that it's brutal.
765,00:31:25.43,00:31:25.43, Downright brutal.
766,00:31:27.10,00:31:27.10, And I didn't plan on that.
767,00:31:28.63,00:31:28.63," I mean, I planned it on being difficult, but not brutal."
768,00:31:31.10,00:31:31.10,This is incredible.
769,00:31:32.77,00:31:32.77,You okay?
770,00:31:34.37,00:31:34.37,No.
771,00:31:35.77,00:31:35.77,"What's hurting you the most,"
772,00:31:36.87,00:31:36.87,the hungeror the-the feeling sick?
773,00:31:38.10,00:31:38.10,Or both?
774,00:31:39.53,00:31:39.53,I think she's just sick.
775,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,-You know what?-(sniffles)
776,00:31:43.53,00:31:43.53,"When you're-- I mean,imagine how you and I feel,"
777,00:31:45.97,00:31:45.97,and we're not sick.
778,00:31:47.43,00:31:47.43,-I know.-I'm about ready to
779,00:31:49.33,00:31:49.33,(chuckles):just keel over any second.
780,00:31:52.50,00:31:52.50,And you're also20 years younger.
781,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,"JANET: Right now, I feel likeI could throw up at any moment."
782,00:31:58.07,00:31:58.07, I-I'm just spent.
783,00:31:59.10,00:31:59.10, I'm physically--
784,00:32:00.67,00:32:00.67,I don't think I've ever beenthis physically exhausted.
785,00:32:03.70,00:32:03.70,I don't know if I cando a challenge.
786,00:32:05.70,00:32:05.70,I'm having trouble walking.
787,00:32:07.93,00:32:07.93,(sniffles)
788,00:32:24.73,00:32:24.73,For all thosewho have some questions
789,00:32:27.77,00:32:27.77,-in this lifetime...-Mm-hmm.
790,00:32:29.77,00:32:29.77,...I'm donatingthe Magic 8 Ball.
791,00:32:32.10,00:32:32.10,-To Tambaqui!-Butch...
792,00:32:33.83,00:32:33.83,ROB: My luxury item was the Magic 8 Ball.
793,00:32:36.57,00:32:36.57, The Magic 8 Ball is a really good thing to have out here.
794,00:32:39.77,00:32:39.77,"Well, one thingthat you may or may not know"
795,00:32:43.13,00:32:43.13,is that it really works.
796,00:32:45.40,00:32:45.40,Are we going to win immunity?
797,00:32:46.87,00:32:46.87,-Do not ask...-(clamoring)
798,00:32:48.53,00:32:48.53,-No!-Time-out. -Go ahead!
799,00:32:50.50,00:32:50.50,We do not ask the Magic 8 Ballquestions like that.
800,00:32:54.73,00:32:54.73,"I told the tribe there was onlyone rule with the Magic 8 Ball,"
801,00:32:58.13,00:32:58.13,and that was thatthey cannot ask it
802,00:33:00.47,00:33:00.47,whether we willwin or lose challenges.
803,00:33:02.50,00:33:02.50,"If it says that we'regoing to lose and we win,"
804,00:33:05.67,00:33:05.67,then we'll knowthe Magic 8 Ball is a sham.
805,00:33:08.13,00:33:08.13,"And if it says that we're goingto lose and we do lose,"
806,00:33:10.47,00:33:10.47,then it will freak us out.
807,00:33:12.70,00:33:12.70,So there's no pointin asking questions like that.
808,00:33:15.10,00:33:15.10,We asked ita bunch of different things.
809,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,A lot of the talkaround the tribe
810,00:33:18.23,00:33:18.23,is centered aroundthe girls' tribe.
811,00:33:19.80,00:33:19.80," Basically, uh, three girls in the girls' tribe:"

841,00:34:35.43,00:34:35.43, a little fishing expedition this morning.
842,00:34:37.03,00:34:37.03, We have a net.
843,00:34:39.70,00:34:39.70,"We placed it, um, in the littlestream that we have here,"
844,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,with intentions ofcatching some big fish.
845,00:34:45.53,00:34:45.53,JOANNA:He just stuck.
846,00:34:46.87,00:34:46.87,"I mean, he is stuck good, too."
847,00:34:48.43,00:34:48.43,Ow.

851,00:34:53.97,00:34:53.97,JEANNE: The only thing we found was some bait.
852,00:34:56.47,00:34:56.47,"It was, like,really hard shell horn pout."
853,00:34:58.80,00:34:58.80,Ow.

855,00:35:02.53,00:35:02.53,It had sharpy... spinesall over it.
856,00:35:05.80,00:35:05.80,"-No, you're going tohave to smash him. -Oh!"
857,00:35:07.23,00:35:07.23,You can't just hit himlike that.
858,00:35:08.33,00:35:08.33,"Well, here, smash him."
859,00:35:10.63,00:35:10.63,One knock and he out.
860,00:35:11.87,00:35:11.87,Look at there.See his tail.
861,00:35:13.17,00:35:13.17,I don't even thinka fish would eat this fish.
862,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,-(chuckles)-We got bait.

867,00:35:28.10,00:35:28.10,We put it on
868,00:35:29.10,00:35:29.10, our fishing poles.
869,00:35:33.00,00:35:33.00,Please tell me we didn'tleave the paddles over there.

871,00:35:38.87,00:35:38.87,about getting fishand left the oars.
872,00:35:43.37,00:35:43.37,I got it in my hand.

884,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60, She's just got this
885,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83,spirit about her that's--
886,00:36:16.93,00:36:16.93,"I think it's great,and I think everyone feels it."
887,00:36:18.83,00:36:18.83,(gasps)Here's one.
888,00:36:20.13,00:36:20.13,A little one?
889,00:36:21.30,00:36:21.30,-Yeah.-Grab his butt.
890,00:36:22.60,00:36:22.60,"JOANNA: We did catch a little fish,"
891,00:36:24.50,00:36:24.50,and he was about this big.
892,00:36:27.47,00:36:27.47,And...
893,00:36:28.53,00:36:28.53, -we were proud. -Want to see
894,00:36:29.73,00:36:29.73,how much proteinwe're going to get out of this?
895,00:36:31.60,00:36:31.60,You know what?Something's better than nothing.
896,00:36:33.60,00:36:33.60,You know what I'm saying?
897,00:36:35.10,00:36:35.10,"No one's going to gross outthat we're eating this, right?"
898,00:36:37.63,00:36:37.63,"-No.-No, it's food."
899,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"I-- See, I can handle the baitway over the mush."
900,00:36:41.37,00:36:41.37,Let's make a little pancake.
901,00:36:42.43,00:36:42.43,HEIDI: Jeanne and Joanna brought back
902,00:36:44.07,00:36:44.07,the miniature-sized fish.
903,00:36:45.57,00:36:45.57,Do you want to helpwith the fire?
904,00:36:47.07,00:36:47.07, I was pretty sure
905,00:36:48.33,00:36:48.33,"that after you gutted the thing,there would have been--"
906,00:36:50.80,00:36:50.80,there's just nothing even left.
907,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,"But we said,""Hey, let's go for it."
908,00:36:55.00,00:36:55.00," We'll still try to cook it somehow."""
909,00:36:57.07,00:36:57.07,"Well, what would we cook it in,that little tiny bit of fish?"
910,00:36:59.90,00:36:59.90,Did somebody find the oil?I think it's in that.
911,00:37:01.57,00:37:01.57,Yeah.
912,00:37:02.57,00:37:02.57,What kind of oil is this?
913,00:37:03.67,00:37:03.67,"-Do we know?-Baby oil, I think."
914,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,Just a little bit.
915,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,"HEIDI: Jeanne had brought, uh--"
916,00:37:07.80,00:37:07.80," it's actually a massage oil,"
917,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,"but it's, like, an edible oil,which is even funnier."
918,00:37:12.60,00:37:12.60," We sliced up this pint-size fish,"
919,00:37:15.90,00:37:15.90,and I seriously thinkI had about that much of it.
920,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,"Father, we thank you for thisopportunity to come together"
921,00:37:22.87,00:37:22.87,like civilized womenand eat like barbarian women.
922,00:37:26.03,00:37:26.03,We thank you. We ask you to letthis be nourishing to our bodies
923,00:37:28.77,00:37:28.77,and help us to be successfulin every attempt that we have
924,00:37:30.93,00:37:30.93,and every goal that we have.
925,00:37:33.77,00:37:33.77,(chuckles)
926,00:37:35.97,00:37:35.97,"I feel likeI'm eating vomit right now,"
927,00:37:37.97,00:37:37.97,when it comes down to it.
928,00:37:39.33,00:37:39.33,Pretty good consistencygoing on.
929,00:37:41.60,00:37:41.60,"That or some snot,one of the two."
930,00:37:44.63,00:37:44.63,(laughs)
931,00:37:45.70,00:37:45.70,"Real good, though."
932,00:37:46.83,00:37:46.83,Thumbs up both ways.
933,00:37:48.20,00:37:48.20,(laughs)
934,00:38:07.20,00:38:07.20,First mail bomb.
935,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,You've got mail.
936,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,Thank God for mail.
937,00:38:12.47,00:38:12.47,"Checking the mail, kids."
938,00:38:15.00,00:38:15.00,"Here we go, first shot."
939,00:38:16.70,00:38:16.70,"-Hey, we got mail.-Oh, yeah."
940,00:38:18.53,00:38:18.53,ROGER: We are the most macho guys

942,00:38:22.87,00:38:22.87,"Good-looking, macho."
943,00:38:24.33,00:38:24.33, We're confident we're going to
944,00:38:25.47,00:38:25.47, get through the first challenge.
945,00:38:26.57,00:38:26.57, There's no doubt about that.
946,00:38:27.67,00:38:27.67,"If we lose to these women, man,"
947,00:38:30.27,00:38:30.27,we are going to getragged on big-time.
948,00:38:32.23,00:38:32.23,"All right, let's go."
949,00:38:34.13,00:38:34.13,"""Working togetherfrom the start,"
950,00:38:36.17,00:38:36.17,"""As time goes by,you'll surely part,"

953,00:38:43.63,00:38:43.63,Oh.
954,00:38:44.73,00:38:44.73,"Oh, it's going to besome sort of..."
955,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,"Oh, balance and agility."
956,00:38:47.17,00:38:47.17,Standing on...on a foot or...
957,00:38:55.87,00:38:55.87,"...two, three."

961,00:39:03.67,00:39:03.67,"DEENA: In my heart of hearts,"
962,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00, I think that the women are going to win
963,00:39:06.73,00:39:06.73,"a couple of immunity challenges,but overall,"
964,00:39:09.00,00:39:09.00,"I think that the menwill probably dominate,"
965,00:39:10.90,00:39:10.90, just based on sheer strength over the women.
966,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,The agility and wit thingI... I can handle.
967,00:39:16.37,00:39:16.37,"The balance thing,I'm, like, okay."
968,00:39:18.53,00:39:18.53,"Who's very goodat balancing, you know?"
969,00:39:20.83,00:39:20.83,JENNA: I told Heidi if it's a physical challenge
970,00:39:22.90,00:39:22.90,"and we can actuallypush them off things,"
971,00:39:24.47,00:39:24.47,that she needsto show them her boobs.
972,00:39:26.20,00:39:26.20, And then we can distract them all and go.
973,00:39:35.87,00:39:35.87,"Head on in, guys."
974,00:39:39.63,00:39:39.63,"Welcome, guys, to your firstimmunity challenge."
975,00:39:44.07,00:39:44.07,"Before we get to that,I just want to check in."
976,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,"Been out here, uh,two nights now."
977,00:39:47.73,00:39:47.73,What's going on with you guys?

983,00:39:56.37,00:39:56.37,"-Oh, yeah. -Plenty of fish.We don't have to try."
984,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,Really?
985,00:39:59.00,00:39:59.00,-Yes.-Plenty of fish.
986,00:40:00.30,00:40:00.30,Catching a lot of fish?
987,00:40:01.33,00:40:01.33,Absolutely.
988,00:40:02.37,00:40:02.37,You buying that?
989,00:40:03.73,00:40:03.73,-(chuckling)-No. -No.
990,00:40:05.00,00:40:05.00,Are you kidding me?
991,00:40:06.00,00:40:06.00,It's terrible.
992,00:40:07.20,00:40:07.20,What's going on with you guys?
993,00:40:08.87,00:40:08.87,"-We got fish, and we ate themthis morning. -Yeah."
994,00:40:10.87,00:40:10.87,-(chuckling)-We did. -Yeah.
995,00:40:12.23,00:40:12.23,For real.
996,00:40:13.40,00:40:13.40,"Guys, you buying that?"
997,00:40:14.57,00:40:14.57,"-No. -No way.-Not at all, no way."
998,00:40:16.07,00:40:16.07,I tasted that grain;it's not that good.
999,00:40:17.83,00:40:17.83,-No. -Just look at them.Look how skinny they are.
1000,00:40:19.63,00:40:19.63,"All right,let's get to today's challenge."
1001,00:40:22.23,00:40:22.23,It is for immunity.
1002,00:40:24.10,00:40:24.10,"More than anything else,"
1003,00:40:25.53,00:40:25.53,you will covet immunity.
1004,00:40:29.80,00:40:29.80,This is what you're playing for.
1005,00:40:31.20,00:40:31.20,This is the immunity idol.
1006,00:40:32.47,00:40:32.47,(cheering)
1007,00:40:33.97,00:40:33.97,Everybody get a feel of that.
1008,00:40:40.47,00:40:40.47,"-Joanna, did you get that?-Mm-hmm."
1009,00:40:42.17,00:40:42.17,All right.
1010,00:40:43.17,00:40:43.17,Guys.

1013,00:40:48.43,00:40:48.43,"All right, more thananything else in the jungle,"
1014,00:40:49.97,00:40:49.97,this is what you want.
1015,00:40:51.50,00:40:51.50,"Long as you have immunity,you're safe, can't be voted out."

1277,00:50:44.43,00:50:44.43,I think we went into itmaybe a little cocky.

1293,00:51:25.30,00:51:25.30,after the chicks were alreadyasked that question.
1294,00:51:29.07,00:51:29.07,"And I think we answeredwith a cocky, arrogant answer."

1338,00:53:05.80,00:53:05.80,What way?
1339,00:53:07.10,00:53:07.10,"Our boy, uh... our boy Ryanis the first one out of here."
1340,00:53:12.20,00:53:12.20,That's fine by me. Um...
1341,00:53:14.00,00:53:14.00,All right. All right.
1342,00:53:15.60,00:53:15.60,We don't need to talk about it.

1347,00:53:24.37,00:53:24.37,I feel we have some connection.
1348,00:53:25.73,00:53:25.73," But somebody, uh, like Daniel,"
1349,00:53:28.20,00:53:28.20," who's not really volunteering to help out,"
1350,00:53:30.90,00:53:30.90, not volunteering to get involved...
1351,00:53:34.27,00:53:34.27,He's not reallydoing it for me right now.
1352,00:53:36.67,00:53:36.67,"Yo, I'm just scaredbecause, uh, Dave seems like"
1353,00:53:39.37,00:53:39.37,he's gettingreally close to Roger.
1354,00:53:40.50,00:53:40.50,Doesn't matter.It doesn't matter.
1355,00:53:42.30,00:53:42.30,"I mean,I-I really like our tribe."

1357,00:53:45.17,00:53:45.17,but I don't feel likekissing Roger's ass.
1358,00:53:47.37,00:53:47.37,"I mean, I've been doing it.I mean, seriously, I mean..."
1359,00:53:49.27,00:53:49.27,"-Yeah, me, too.-""Go cut wood."
1360,00:53:50.80,00:53:50.80,"Cut this. Do that.""And that's fine. I mean, cool."
1361,00:53:52.40,00:53:52.40,I don't mind.I'm not complaining.
1362,00:53:53.50,00:53:53.50,"I'm just saying, but..."
1363,00:53:54.67,00:53:54.67,MATTHEW: There's a lot of tension now.
1364,00:53:55.93,00:53:55.93, Everyone seems to be jockeying for position.
1365,00:53:57.63,00:53:57.63,There's a lot of frictionbetween Ryan and Roger.
1366,00:54:01.47,00:54:01.47, I think that the friction has built up over the last
1367,00:54:04.70,00:54:04.70," couple of days, and"
1368,00:54:06.60,00:54:06.60,it's culminatedin kind of a face-off.
1369,00:54:08.67,00:54:08.67,We have to gofor the big time now.
1370,00:54:10.80,00:54:10.80,We go for Roger tonight.
1371,00:54:11.97,00:54:11.97,-That's three votes.-Uh-huh.
1372,00:54:13.60,00:54:13.60,We don't talk anymore tonight.We don't look at
1373,00:54:15.47,00:54:15.47,each other tonight. Stay the ...away from each other.
1374,00:54:17.30,00:54:17.30,"We do this, and we go down."
1375,00:54:19.03,00:54:19.03,"-Hands in, we all made a pact.-Okay, that's cool."
1376,00:54:21.03,00:54:21.03,"-I'm with you, man.-So what's the name?"
1377,00:54:22.60,00:54:22.60,-Say it one more time.-Roger.
1378,00:54:23.83,00:54:23.83,Done.
1379,00:54:24.83,00:54:24.83,"RYAN: Right now, what I got to do is I got to go after Roger"
1380,00:54:28.03,00:54:28.03, and break that whole coalition up.
1381,00:54:29.77,00:54:29.77,"I just feel that they'regoing to try to go for me,"
1382,00:54:31.70,00:54:31.70,so I got to go for him;I have no choice.
1383,00:54:35.97,00:54:35.97,"They're gonna pick us off oneby one, I'm letting you know."
1384,00:54:38.20,00:54:38.20,"So I'm saying right now,I guarantee you"
1385,00:54:39.60,00:54:39.60,we can have four votes now.
1386,00:54:40.87,00:54:40.87,"They might go for Daniel,or they might go for me,"
1387,00:54:42.57,00:54:42.57,-and we can still win.-ROB: Ryan is
1388,00:54:44.40,00:54:44.40,"fun, but he's also loud, uh,"
1389,00:54:48.23,00:54:48.23,abrasive at timesand extremely self-centered.
1390,00:54:51.10,00:54:51.10,"If you say you don't wantto know, it's fine,"
1391,00:54:52.63,00:54:52.63,"but just I'm asking you--if we're good, we're good."
1392,00:54:54.47,00:54:54.47,I'm not gonna...
1393,00:54:55.47,00:54:55.47,"'Kay, we're good."
1394,00:54:57.67,00:54:57.67,"No more talking, to anybody."
1395,00:54:59.40,00:54:59.40,"Don't look at anybody else,just say tonight: ""Roger."""
1396,00:55:01.90,00:55:01.90,"-Yeah. Game, set, match.-All right, man."
1397,00:55:03.43,00:55:03.43,Done.

1399,00:55:07.37,00:55:07.37,and look out for other people's interests at times.
1400,00:55:09.70,00:55:09.70, The guy is focused only on himself.
1401,00:55:11.87,00:55:11.87,"Roger, on-- for his part,though, is extremely bossy"
1402,00:55:15.30,00:55:15.30,"and is telling everybody,everybody what to do."
1403,00:55:17.63,00:55:17.63,Real quickly.

1408,00:55:30.73,00:55:30.73,that's what'sthe important thing.
1409,00:55:31.80,00:55:31.80,"Yeah, we are."

1411,00:55:34.90,00:55:34.90," to vote with him to get rid of Roger,"
1412,00:55:37.27,00:55:37.27,and Roger has asked me to votewith him to get rid of Ryan.
1413,00:55:42.00,00:55:42.00,And I've told them boththat I will do what they want.
1414,00:55:44.87,00:55:44.87,Ready to party on?
1415,00:55:46.07,00:55:46.07,-Yep.-Ready.
1416,00:55:47.20,00:55:47.20,"-Let's go, guys.-ROB: It's Roger"
1417,00:55:48.70,00:55:48.70, versus Ryan.
1418,00:55:50.30,00:55:50.30, I'm just going to see which way it clears out.
1419,00:55:51.90,00:55:51.90," I mean, both guys have their pluses and minuses."
1420,00:56:19.93,00:56:19.93,Behind each of you guys isa torch in your tribe color.
1421,00:56:24.00,00:56:24.00,"Grab a torch,approach the flame,"
1422,00:56:26.10,00:56:26.10,dip it and get fire.
1423,00:56:31.33,00:56:31.33,This is part of the ritualof Tribal Council
1424,00:56:33.63,00:56:33.63,because firemost definitely represents
1425,00:56:35.83,00:56:35.83,your life in this game.
1426,00:56:37.53,00:56:37.53,"As long as you have fire,you're still alive."
1427,00:56:39.23,00:56:39.23,"When your fire's done,so are you."
1428,00:56:42.53,00:56:42.53,Take a seat.
1429,00:56:47.70,00:56:47.70,Tribal Council is where you are
1430,00:56:50.63,00:56:50.63,held accountablefor your action.
1431,00:56:52.33,00:56:52.33,"Tonight, somebody will be"
1432,00:56:54.13,00:56:54.13,the first personvoted out of the Amazon.
1433,00:56:55.93,00:56:55.93,"But before we get to that,let's have a little chat."
1434,00:56:59.03,00:56:59.03,I'm guessing this has to be
1435,00:57:00.83,00:57:00.83,really humblingfor you guys right now.
1436,00:57:03.67,00:57:03.67,"-Say that again.-Or am I wrong, Roger?"
1437,00:57:05.20,00:57:05.20,"Is it just one challenge,you know,"
1438,00:57:06.57,00:57:06.57,"and, hey, what's the big deal?"
1439,00:57:08.03,00:57:08.03,"It's-It's humbling, but,uh, you know, we did our best."
1440,00:57:10.93,00:57:10.93,And the interesting thing was
1441,00:57:12.37,00:57:12.37,we thought we weregoing to get on the--
1442,00:57:13.93,00:57:13.93,"get beat on the mental side,"
1443,00:57:15.60,00:57:15.60,and they actually beat uson the physical side.
1444,00:57:17.47,00:57:17.47,And that was a shock.
1445,00:57:18.70,00:57:18.70,"No, they beat youall the way around."
1446,00:57:20.00,00:57:20.00,Okay.(chuckles)
1447,00:57:22.17,00:57:22.17,"-Well?-Well, they did. They--"
1448,00:57:23.67,00:57:23.67,"Hey, they won fair and square."
1449,00:57:24.83,00:57:24.83,"And, you know, what can you say?"
1450,00:57:27.73,00:57:27.73,"Well, there werea lot of comments made,"
1451,00:57:30.37,00:57:30.37,"specifically by you,Daniel, on the boat--"
1452,00:57:32.53,00:57:32.53,"""We will notlose one challenge."""
1453,00:57:34.97,00:57:34.97,"Well, you know,that's what happens when you get"
1454,00:57:36.87,00:57:36.87,"a little cocky, you know,you get humbled."
1455,00:57:39.47,00:57:39.47,"Hey, it was a mistake."
1456,00:57:40.90,00:57:40.90,"I think all-all of our guys,we did really well."
1457,00:57:44.03,00:57:44.03,"I mean, we had it,but I blew it."
1458,00:57:46.53,00:57:46.53,"I mean, it's my fault."
1459,00:57:47.80,00:57:47.80,I'm the reason why we're here.
1460,00:57:49.30,00:57:49.30,-Really?-Mm-hmm.
1461,00:57:50.77,00:57:50.77,"But you're-you're tiednext to your partner here, Ryan,"
1462,00:57:53.40,00:57:53.40,who didn't seem to bedoing a lot better.
1463,00:57:55.70,00:57:55.70,"Well, hey, you know,"
1464,00:57:57.10,00:57:57.10,"the girls--they might have won the battle,"
1465,00:57:58.73,00:57:58.73,but they haven't won the war.
1466,00:58:00.30,00:58:00.30,"Alex, how tough is it to be"
1467,00:58:03.20,00:58:03.20,so overconfident and lose?
1468,00:58:06.07,00:58:06.07,I think initiallywe were pretty over--
1469,00:58:08.17,00:58:08.17,we were pretty confident.
1470,00:58:09.50,00:58:09.50,"We were like,yeah, gung ho guys."
1471,00:58:11.70,00:58:11.70,Women are notgoing to just roll over.
1472,00:58:13.50,00:58:13.50,They're going to wantto compete even harder
1473,00:58:15.57,00:58:15.57,because it's women against men.
1474,00:58:17.23,00:58:17.23,And today is proof of it.
1475,00:58:19.30,00:58:19.30,We worked really hard.
1476,00:58:21.00,00:58:21.00,We got beat.
1477,00:58:22.00,00:58:22.00,We had a bad day.
1478,00:58:23.27,00:58:23.27,That's all it comes down to.
1479,00:58:25.00,00:58:25.00,You had a few minutesto see the women.
1480,00:58:27.30,00:58:27.30,I know you talked about them.
1481,00:58:28.90,00:58:28.90,Anybody stand out?
1482,00:58:30.50,00:58:30.50,I think every one of those girlshas a unique quality...
1483,00:58:33.17,00:58:33.17,-(laughter)-Uh...
1484,00:58:34.67,00:58:34.67,"...and, uh, some have moreunique qualities than others."
1485,00:58:37.27,00:58:37.27,Some are physically unique.
1486,00:58:39.47,00:58:39.47,"But when it's all said and done,uh, none of those girls are"
1487,00:58:42.97,00:58:42.97,"worth a million dollars,and that's where I stand."
1488,00:58:45.33,00:58:45.33,"How about you, Daniel?"
1489,00:58:46.83,00:58:46.83,I'll just go out and say I thinkShawna is pretty damn hot.
1490,00:58:49.67,00:58:49.67,"Uh, she's very athletic."
1491,00:58:51.30,00:58:51.30,She's got a great body.
1492,00:58:52.67,00:58:52.67,"But I don't know. Right now,"
1493,00:58:54.23,00:58:54.23,"after not showeringfor three days,"
1494,00:58:55.90,00:58:55.90,"I don't know how attractedI would be to her, but..."
1495,00:58:57.93,00:58:57.93,(chuckles)
1496,00:58:58.93,00:58:58.93,But you're putting it out there.
1497,00:59:00.37,00:59:00.37,-Yeah.-Dave.
1498,00:59:01.93,00:59:01.93,"Follow suit, Shawna worea, uh, ski hat; that's badass."
1499,00:59:05.30,00:59:05.30,I think Ryan was-wastrying to say it.
1500,00:59:07.50,00:59:07.50,Make an analogy--the quarterback doesn't
1501,00:59:09.87,00:59:09.87,screw the cheerleadersat halftime.
1502,00:59:11.43,00:59:11.43,"You know, we're hereto play the game."
1503,00:59:13.43,00:59:13.43,Wow.
1504,00:59:14.80,00:59:14.80,You should beliving with these guys.
1505,00:59:16.27,00:59:16.27,(laughter)
1506,00:59:17.27,00:59:17.27,Alex.
1507,00:59:19.13,00:59:19.13,I'm going to be the third oneto vote for Shawna here.
1508,00:59:21.20,00:59:21.20,She's-She's a hottie.
1509,00:59:22.20,00:59:22.20,-Bangarang.-Yeah.
1510,00:59:23.63,00:59:23.63,"Yeah, absolutely."
1511,00:59:25.03,00:59:25.03,"I just wanted to, uh,add to my vote that I also think"
1512,00:59:28.10,00:59:28.10,"that Shawna is hot, but I thinkthat Heidi is the hottest."
1513,00:59:31.60,00:59:31.60,"You know what's greatabout th-- Oh, Ryan, yes?"
1514,00:59:34.37,00:59:34.37,(scattered chuckles)
1515,00:59:36.73,00:59:36.73,He loves that girl.
1516,00:59:38.60,00:59:38.60,"I mean, he-he really,really likes..."
1517,00:59:40.40,00:59:40.40,"Now, ""love"" is a strong word,"
1518,00:59:41.83,00:59:41.83,being that I've neverspoken to her.
1519,00:59:43.23,00:59:43.23,PROBST:You know what's great?
1520,00:59:44.57,00:59:44.57,You came out from day onetalking more trash
1521,00:59:47.47,00:59:47.47,"than I've ever heard, ever."
1522,00:59:49.60,00:59:49.60,You got your asses kicked.
1523,00:59:51.47,00:59:51.47,"And yet, when we get to women,it's like, ""Ah, who cares?"
1524,00:59:53.63,00:59:53.63,"I want to hook up."""
1525,00:59:55.10,00:59:55.10,That's why you guys could bereally in serious trouble.
1526,01:00:01.17,01:00:01.17,All right.
1527,01:00:03.33,01:00:03.33,It is time to vote.
1528,01:00:05.13,01:00:05.13,"Roger, you're first."
1529,01:00:22.67,01:00:22.67,"He gives me so much advice,it really irritates me."
1530,01:00:40.17,01:00:40.17,"My advice to you is, uh,"
1531,01:00:41.30,01:00:41.30,don't hunt what you can't kill.
1532,01:00:58.70,01:00:58.70,"Ryan, I thinkyou're a pretty good boy."
1533,01:01:01.17,01:01:01.17,The only problem isthat you're still a boy.
1534,01:01:03.10,01:01:03.10,Sometimes silence is golden.
1535,01:01:16.80,01:01:16.80,I didn't like your attitude at
1536,01:01:18.37,01:01:18.37,"the immunity challenge today,"
1537,01:01:19.97,01:01:19.97,and I didn't like the way
1538,01:01:21.40,01:01:21.40,it reflected upon the team.
1539,01:01:35.63,01:01:35.63,I'll go tally the votes.
1540,01:01:43.63,01:01:43.63,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
1541,01:01:46.07,01:01:46.07,The person voted outwill be asked to leave
1542,01:01:48.17,01:01:48.17,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
1543,01:01:50.10,01:01:50.10,I'll read the votes.
1544,01:01:54.23,01:01:54.23,First vote...
1545,01:01:56.97,01:01:56.97,Ryan.
1546,01:02:04.00,01:02:04.00,Roger.
1547,01:02:07.97,01:02:07.97,Dan.
1548,01:02:09.53,01:02:09.53,"One vote Dan, one vote Ryan,one vote Roger."
1549,01:02:18.80,01:02:18.80,Ryan.
1550,01:02:23.40,01:02:23.40,Roger.
1551,01:02:26.37,01:02:26.37,"One vote Dan, two votes Ryan,two votes Roger."
1552,01:02:33.80,01:02:33.80,Ryan.
1553,01:02:41.10,01:02:41.10,Roger.
1554,01:02:42.73,01:02:42.73,"We're tied: three votes Ryan,three votes Roger."
1555,01:02:47.90,01:02:47.90,First personvoted out of the tribe...
1556,01:02:53.37,01:02:53.37,Ryan.Need to bring me your torch.
1557,01:03:07.53,01:03:07.53,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
1558,01:03:13.33,01:03:13.33,"It's time for you to go, man."
1559,01:03:26.43,01:03:26.43,"Came into the gamea little confident,"
1560,01:03:28.47,01:03:28.47,maybe a little arrogant.
1561,01:03:29.67,01:03:29.67,But what should bemore concerning is this is
1562,01:03:32.20,01:03:32.20,"clearly a tribe divided,based on tonight's vote."
1563,01:03:35.37,01:03:35.37,Might be somethingworth looking at.
1564,01:03:37.17,01:03:37.17,36 more days.
1565,01:03:38.70,01:03:38.70,Guys can head back to camp.
1566,01:03:40.00,01:03:40.00,Good night.
1567,01:03:56.90,01:03:56.90,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
1568,01:04:03.67,01:04:03.67,PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
1569,01:04:04.97,01:04:04.97," An Amazon storm hits both tribes,"
1570,01:04:07.23,01:04:07.23, leaving the men dry...
1571,01:04:09.07,01:04:09.07,Suck to be outside right now.
1572,01:04:10.73,01:04:10.73, ...and the women drenched.
1573,01:04:11.97,01:04:11.97,Forgot that we're inthe middle of the Amazon
1574,01:04:13.70,01:04:13.70,and that torrential rainstormscome by daily.
1575,01:04:15.70,01:04:15.70, And a shocking discovery
1576,01:04:17.17,01:04:17.17, threatens to split the Jaburu tribe.
1577,01:04:19.57,01:04:19.57,There's something in there thatshouldn't be in there.
1578,01:04:21.33,01:04:21.33,Somebody just needs to fess up.
1579,01:04:28.33,01:04:28.33,"Well, guys, here we are."
1580,01:04:29.97,01:04:29.97,"I guess when I knewI did Survivor,"
1581,01:04:31.60,01:04:31.60,I knew I was in for the biggestchallenge of my life.
1582,01:04:33.60,01:04:33.60," And, uh, I definitely got what I came in for,"
1583,01:04:35.90,01:04:35.90, and I definitely got what I expected.
1584,01:04:37.33,01:04:37.33," Um, I learned a lot, though."
1585,01:04:38.73,01:04:38.73," I learned how to make shelter, and more importantly,"
1586,01:04:40.60,01:04:40.60," I learned a lot about myself and, uh, how I perceive others"
1587,01:04:43.20,01:04:43.20, and how they perceive me.
1588,01:04:44.73,01:04:44.73,"You know, I thought I'd be mad, but for the first time,"
1589,01:04:46.83,01:04:46.83," I just, I really put things in perspective."
1590,01:04:48.57,01:04:48.57, And it was a great journey.
1591,01:04:50.33,01:04:50.33, I had a lot of fun.
1592,01:04:51.60,01:04:51.60, I wish you guys all the best.
1593,01:04:53.20,01:04:53.20," So good luck to the winner,"
1594,01:04:54.47,01:04:54.47,"and, uh, we'll see youaround soon."
1595,01:04:56.87,01:04:56.87,"And, uh, God bless."
