2,00:00:11.13,00:00:11.13,JEFF PROBST: We are making our way upriver along the Rio Negro
3,00:00:13.83,00:00:13.83," in northern Brazil,  where the temperature is"
4,00:00:16.10,00:00:16.10, a scorching 103 degrees  and these 16 Americans
5,00:00:19.43,00:00:19.43, are set to begin  the adventure of a lifetime.
6,00:00:22.47,00:00:22.47,They're about to be abandoned in the middle of the largest
7,00:00:25.10,00:00:25.10,and most magnificent tropical rainforest in the world:
8,00:00:28.43,00:00:28.43,the Amazon.
9,00:00:29.60,00:00:29.60," Spanning two and a half  million miles,"
10,00:00:32.30,00:00:32.30, the Amazon is responsible  for 15% of the world's oxygen
11,00:00:36.50,00:00:36.50, and is the world's largest  freshwater source.
12,00:00:39.00,00:00:39.00," For much of the season, the Amazon is a flooded forest,"
13,00:00:42.27,00:00:42.27, a land covered by  up to 60 feet of water.
14,00:00:45.20,00:00:45.20," But as the dry season emerges,  the river subsides,"
15,00:00:48.33,00:00:48.33, revealing the dangers  that lurk beneath:
16,00:00:51.20,00:00:51.20," caiman crocodiles,  schools of piranha,"
17,00:00:54.13,00:00:54.13, and the world's most  feared snake: the anaconda.
18,00:00:58.43,00:00:58.43,(thunder rumbling)
19,00:01:00.60,00:01:00.60," Soon, torrential thunderstorms  will arrive,"
20,00:01:03.40,00:01:03.40, rocking this jungle
21,00:01:04.73,00:01:04.73, and submerging the forest  once again.
22,00:01:06.87,00:01:06.87,This will be their home for the next 39 days.
23,00:01:13.77,00:01:13.77, It is the ultimate challenge.
24,00:01:16.00,00:01:16.00," 16 strangers, all from  different walks of life,"
25,00:01:19.00,00:01:19.00," left to fend for themselves,  utilizing the resources"
26,00:01:21.77,00:01:21.77, of the land and their own  survival skills;
27,00:01:24.90,00:01:24.90,forced to work together to create a new society
28,00:01:27.90,00:01:27.90, while battling the elements  and each other.
29,00:01:31.17,00:01:31.17,"They must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted from the tribe."
30,00:01:33.70,00:01:33.70," In the end,  only one will remain"
31,00:01:35.97,00:01:35.97, to claim  the million-dollar prize.
32,00:01:43.60,00:01:43.60,"39 days, 16 people, one Survivor."
33,00:02:56.00,00:02:56.00,"PROBST:  Okay, guys."
34,00:02:57.60,00:02:57.60, Traveled a long way upriver.
35,00:02:58.73,00:02:58.73, Now it's time to find out
36,00:03:00.40,00:03:00.40, who your tribemates  are going to be.
37,00:03:04.50,00:03:04.50,"As I call out your name,"
38,00:03:05.83,00:03:05.83,want you to climb down the rope ladder
39,00:03:07.37,00:03:07.37,and get in the yellow boat.
40,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,Jeanne.
41,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00,Heidi.
42,00:03:22.33,00:03:22.33,Joanna.
43,00:03:28.67,00:03:28.67,Jenna.
44,00:03:34.37,00:03:34.37,Christy.
45,00:03:41.93,00:03:41.93,"HEIDI: When Jeff called  the fifth girl, I knew it,"
46,00:03:44.40,00:03:44.40,"like, instantly."
47,00:03:45.50,00:03:45.50, This is an all-woman tribe.
48,00:03:46.73,00:03:46.73,Whoo!
49,00:03:47.80,00:03:47.80,"-(excited chatter) -Come on, Shawna."
50,00:03:49.87,00:03:49.87,Deena.
51,00:03:53.80,00:03:53.80,Janet.
52,00:03:57.70,00:03:57.70,Shawna.
53,00:04:00.10,00:04:00.10,"Once you guys are on board, you can introduce yourselves,"
54,00:04:02.90,00:04:02.90,celebrate your fellow members.
55,00:04:04.93,00:04:04.93,"(laughter, excited chatter)"
56,00:04:06.90,00:04:06.90,Woo-hoo!
57,00:04:08.13,00:04:08.13,DEENA: I was absolutely  just overjoyed
58,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30, that it was  an all-female tribe.
59,00:04:12.27,00:04:12.27, It's an all-chick thing.
60,00:04:14.07,00:04:14.07,We can let our hair down.
61,00:04:15.53,00:04:15.53,We can pee in front of each other.
62,00:04:17.37,00:04:17.37," I'm on an equal playing field,"
63,00:04:19.53,00:04:19.53, because I have seven other  people of the same sex.
64,00:04:22.27,00:04:22.27,"Men, as I call out your name, climb down the rope ladder,"
65,00:04:25.70,00:04:25.70,get in the blue boat.
66,00:04:27.13,00:04:27.13,Roger.
67,00:04:29.10,00:04:29.10,ROGER: It's gonna be the men  against the women.
68,00:04:31.10,00:04:31.10, But they don't have  the strength.
69,00:04:32.90,00:04:32.90,They may have the will.
70,00:04:34.63,00:04:34.63,"But, you know-- and this is a forbidden place."
71,00:04:36.80,00:04:36.80, It's pathetic.
72,00:04:37.90,00:04:37.90,PROBST: Alex.
73,00:04:41.57,00:04:41.57,Rob.
74,00:04:42.90,00:04:42.90,Butch.
75,00:04:47.30,00:04:47.30,Daniel.
76,00:04:51.77,00:04:51.77,Dave.
77,00:04:54.57,00:04:54.57,Ryan.
78,00:04:55.47,00:04:55.47,"(laughter, excited chatter)"
79,00:04:58.00,00:04:58.00,"Matthew, finish it out."
80,00:05:03.47,00:05:03.47,Dave.
81,00:05:04.70,00:05:04.70,DANIEL: All the guys  were really pumped up.
82,00:05:06.20,00:05:06.20, There is no way that women are  going to beat us in anything--
83,00:05:09.97,00:05:09.97,"physical, mentally or whatever."
84,00:05:12.63,00:05:12.63, We're never going to go  to Tribal Council.
85,00:05:14.97,00:05:14.97,Tribal Council? We ain't going to Tribal Council.
86,00:05:17.03,00:05:17.03,JENNA:  They're so freakin' cocky.
87,00:05:19.20,00:05:19.20,"They're, like, ""Oh, we're never"
88,00:05:20.60,00:05:20.60,"going to go to Tribal Council."""
89,00:05:22.30,00:05:22.30,"And, ugh, it's just so annoying."
90,00:05:24.67,00:05:24.67,"I just want to beat them to just kind of, like, shut them up."
91,00:05:28.07,00:05:28.07,"PROBST: All right, guys."
92,00:05:30.20,00:05:30.20,Just want to tell you guys a quick story about how the Amazon
93,00:05:33.97,00:05:33.97,got its name.
94,00:05:35.17,00:05:35.17,"This place was discovered in 1541, Spanish explorer."
95,00:05:38.60,00:05:38.60,"While he's making his way through here, he encounters"
96,00:05:41.23,00:05:41.23,"a tribe of very fierce, very courageous female warriors."
97,00:05:45.37,00:05:45.37,"-(women cheer, chuckle) -Women only."
98,00:05:47.60,00:05:47.60,This was the first notion that women could survive
99,00:05:50.07,00:05:50.07,just fine on their own.
100,00:05:51.57,00:05:51.57,So he named the Amazon after these female warriors.
101,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,"That is where the term ""Amazon women"" comes from."
102,00:05:58.97,00:05:58.97,"So, it is only fitting that for the first time,"
103,00:06:01.77,00:06:01.77,"while we're here in the Amazon,"
104,00:06:02.93,00:06:02.93,we have a tribe of women versus a tribe of men.
105,00:06:06.90,00:06:06.90,"(cheering, applause)"
106,00:06:08.73,00:06:08.73,"Ladies, your tribe name is"
107,00:06:11.83,00:06:11.83,"""Jaburu,"" after the bird."
108,00:06:14.20,00:06:14.20,Pass out your buffs.
109,00:06:15.53,00:06:15.53,-Whoo! -Jaburu!
110,00:06:16.53,00:06:16.53,"Men, your tribe name:"
111,00:06:18.97,00:06:18.97,"""Tambaqui,"" after the fish."
112,00:06:20.57,00:06:20.57,Here are your buffs.
113,00:06:22.87,00:06:22.87,Maps to your new home.
114,00:06:27.57,00:06:27.57,Some very meager supplies are awaiting you guys.
115,00:06:30.40,00:06:30.40,"Ladies, you will begin by heading left around the bend."
116,00:06:32.30,00:06:32.30,"Men, you will go out right."
117,00:06:34.67,00:06:34.67,Look for your tribe flags at your new home.
118,00:06:38.03,00:06:38.03,Shove off!
119,00:06:38.90,00:06:38.90,(excited chatter)
120,00:06:51.00,00:06:51.00,SHAWNA:  I just got up there.
121,00:06:52.33,00:06:52.33, And my brain was  so jumpy that I just
122,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23, couldn't even untie a boat.
123,00:07:12.37,00:07:12.37, And I just felt so stupid.
124,00:07:14.60,00:07:14.60,"The guys going off one way, the girls couldn't untie--"
125,00:07:16.97,00:07:16.97,"well, I couldn't untie the knot."
126,00:07:21.83,00:07:21.83,(men chattering)
127,00:07:25.13,00:07:25.13,"Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys, look."
128,00:07:28.20,00:07:28.20,"You know, it's only gonna be light for probably"
129,00:07:29.93,00:07:29.93,"-another five hours. -Let's rocket, guys."
130,00:07:31.50,00:07:31.50,"We better damn well have us a fire, you know what I mean?"
131,00:07:34.27,00:07:34.27,"RYAN:  All the strategy I had,"
132,00:07:35.60,00:07:35.60, it was taken  and thrown all out the window.
133,00:07:37.63,00:07:37.63, It sucks when you have  a game plan
134,00:07:39.30,00:07:39.30," that you, like,  know that'll work."
135,00:07:40.97,00:07:40.97,"And now it's like, I got eight guys"
136,00:07:43.53,00:07:43.53,"and it's all one big sausage fest, you know?"
137,00:07:46.63,00:07:46.63,"One, two, three."
138,00:07:48.63,00:07:48.63,"Hup, two, three. Hup, two, three."
139,00:07:52.40,00:07:52.40,"Hup, two, three. Hup..."
140,00:08:00.30,00:08:00.30,"Well, we're all trying to act like it's not a big deal..."
141,00:08:02.07,00:08:02.07,(indistinct voices)
142,00:08:05.70,00:08:05.70,"Janet, what do you do?"
143,00:08:07.13,00:08:07.13,I'm a nurse.
144,00:08:08.83,00:08:08.83,And I'm trained in emergency medicine.
145,00:08:11.33,00:08:11.33,-Yeah! -(cheering)
146,00:08:13.23,00:08:13.23,And I... and I've done medical missions out...
147,00:08:15.43,00:08:15.43,JENNA: Stranded in the jungle  with seven other women--
148,00:08:18.43,00:08:18.43, is my worst nightmare.
149,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67," If you're on a tribe  with all women,"
150,00:08:21.03,00:08:21.03,you can't use any of your womanly powers on women.
151,00:08:24.87,00:08:24.87,They could care less. They find that insulting.
152,00:08:27.00,00:08:27.00,"With men, it's just, you can manipulate them better."
153,00:08:30.13,00:08:30.13,"(laughter, chattering)"
154,00:08:32.50,00:08:32.50,Exactly!
155,00:08:33.90,00:08:33.90,Oh!
156,00:08:35.17,00:08:35.17,That was the worst.
157,00:08:45.17,00:08:45.17,"-Oh, there it is. -Is that it?"
158,00:08:46.83,00:08:46.83,"No, right there. Almost dead ahead."
159,00:08:48.77,00:08:48.77,"-Oh, yeah. -Whoo!"
160,00:08:50.30,00:08:50.30,-(cheering) -Yeah!
161,00:08:52.37,00:08:52.37,"Go straight ahead, guys."
162,00:08:53.67,00:08:53.67,We got to get across. Let's go.
163,00:08:55.13,00:08:55.13,Let's get there.
164,00:08:56.13,00:08:56.13,"The minute we saw our flag,"
165,00:08:57.37,00:08:57.37,we beelined it right to the shore.
166,00:08:58.97,00:08:58.97," You know, I think we're all  excited, um, to keep going,"
167,00:09:01.60,00:09:01.60," get-- start building  the shelter,"
168,00:09:03.83,00:09:03.83, start getting a fire.
169,00:09:05.07,00:09:05.07,-Up a little. -You got it.
170,00:09:06.67,00:09:06.67,Yeah!
171,00:09:07.97,00:09:07.97,-Whoo! -(cheering)
172,00:09:09.53,00:09:09.53,Yeah!
173,00:09:10.83,00:09:10.83,-All right. -That was easy.
174,00:09:12.37,00:09:12.37,"Yeah, where's our meager supplies?"
175,00:09:13.50,00:09:13.50,Our meager supplies are
176,00:09:14.53,00:09:14.53,"right up, right up there in that box."
177,00:09:16.87,00:09:16.87,"Ready, guys?"
178,00:09:18.37,00:09:18.37,All right.
179,00:09:19.40,00:09:19.40,-Tambaqui. -Tambaqui!
180,00:09:21.13,00:09:21.13,ALL: Tambaqui!
181,00:09:22.40,00:09:22.40,-(cheering) -Yeah!
182,00:09:23.90,00:09:23.90,"-All right, guys. -All right."
183,00:09:24.97,00:09:24.97,-How you open this? -Break it open.
184,00:09:26.13,00:09:26.13,Crack... crack this baby open.
185,00:09:27.57,00:09:27.57,"Look, while we're all here, man, I think, uh,"
186,00:09:30.23,00:09:30.23,"I think Roger said something that was, uh, really important"
187,00:09:34.20,00:09:34.20,early on we should make sure we capitalize on.
188,00:09:36.23,00:09:36.23,"That's that, you know, we're all, we're all"
189,00:09:37.93,00:09:37.93,"freakin' men of pride, men of honor, whatnot."
190,00:09:39.60,00:09:39.60,(chuckles)
191,00:09:40.67,00:09:40.67,"-And right now, baby... -Tell it!"
192,00:09:43.03,00:09:43.03,"...yo, we're the favorites right now."
193,00:09:44.53,00:09:44.53,"Straight up, you know?"
194,00:09:45.73,00:09:45.73,"Physically, we're so much more adept."
195,00:09:48.33,00:09:48.33,"Um, we got everything riding on this."
196,00:09:50.33,00:09:50.33,We'd look like the biggest ass ever if we go home.
197,00:09:52.57,00:09:52.57,"Wait, wait, bottom line, bottom line is we're not going home"
198,00:09:54.50,00:09:54.50,"if we lose, 'cause we can't."
199,00:09:55.77,00:09:55.77,RYAN:   Bottom line is
200,00:09:56.77,00:09:56.77,a lot of girls over there are
201,00:09:58.13,00:09:58.13,"eye candy, and that, and that's great to look at."
202,00:10:00.40,00:10:00.40,I appreciate look at them.
203,00:10:01.87,00:10:01.87,Thank you for wearing bikinis.
204,00:10:03.27,00:10:03.27,"But when it comes down to it, I mean, it's--"
205,00:10:06.20,00:10:06.20,you want people that are gonna be useful.
206,00:10:08.20,00:10:08.20, Our butts are  on the stove right now.
207,00:10:09.70,00:10:09.70," If we lose to the girls,  I mean, it's gonna be rough."
208,00:10:12.27,00:10:12.27, It's gonna be really rough.
209,00:10:14.13,00:10:14.13,"-Keep it real, man. -Oh."
210,00:10:15.77,00:10:15.77,-All right. -We got to remember...
211,00:10:17.03,00:10:17.03,"-Yeah, careful, guys. -You got to be careful."
212,00:10:19.03,00:10:19.03,"Be careful with these machetes, all right?"
213,00:10:21.73,00:10:21.73,They can kill you.
214,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,"-Here, why don't you just... -Let's just go ahead"
215,00:10:25.73,00:10:25.73,-and start getting that out. -See what we got here.
216,00:10:27.40,00:10:27.40,"ROGER:  We open the box,"
217,00:10:28.57,00:10:28.57,"and lo and behold, in the box,"
218,00:10:30.47,00:10:30.47,"there's the five gallons of fresh water,"
219,00:10:32.93,00:10:32.93, there were fish hooks.
220,00:10:34.63,00:10:34.63,Fishing line and hooks.
221,00:10:36.70,00:10:36.70," There was kerosene,"
222,00:10:39.17,00:10:39.17, two lanterns.
223,00:10:40.93,00:10:40.93,There was a flint.
224,00:10:42.33,00:10:42.33,That's good to know.
225,00:10:44.87,00:10:44.87,What's this?
226,00:10:46.10,00:10:46.10,"Um, something we don't have a key..."
227,00:10:47.30,00:10:47.30,ALEX:  We have a mystery box.
228,00:10:48.73,00:10:48.73,We have a box that had a note on it that said...
229,00:10:51.10,00:10:51.10,"""Do not open till instructed..."
230,00:10:53.03,00:10:53.03,"A key will appear when you least expect it."""
231,00:10:55.43,00:10:55.43,All right.
232,00:10:56.43,00:10:56.43,So I don't know what that means.
233,00:10:58.43,00:10:58.43,"Um, but-- so we, so we don't know"
234,00:11:00.17,00:11:00.17,what's in the mystery box yet.
235,00:11:01.43,00:11:01.43,Look at all this.
236,00:11:02.77,00:11:02.77,Manioc flour.
237,00:11:04.03,00:11:04.03," We got a big thing  of manioc flour,"
238,00:11:05.67,00:11:05.67, and that stuff's actually
239,00:11:06.90,00:11:06.90,"got some pretty good nutritional value, some--"
240,00:11:08.87,00:11:08.87,lots of carbohydrates and can keep us going for a while.
241,00:11:10.70,00:11:10.70,And we got a huge thing of it.
242,00:11:12.37,00:11:12.37,"All right, let's huddle up."
243,00:11:14.50,00:11:14.50,"Let's, let's have a group huddle."
244,00:11:15.77,00:11:15.77,Everybody get together.
245,00:11:17.10,00:11:17.10,"Let's, let's get calm."
246,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,Let's get our machetes.
247,00:11:20.10,00:11:20.10,So cool. My parents would never let me have a machete.
248,00:11:23.33,00:11:23.33,(chuckles)
249,00:11:33.13,00:11:33.13,"HEIDI:  We were paddling away,"
250,00:11:35.47,00:11:35.47," and, uh, we finally see  the yellow flag."
251,00:11:38.07,00:11:38.07,All right!
252,00:11:41.27,00:11:41.27,"I was so excited, so excited."
253,00:11:43.40,00:11:43.40,How we going to get up?
254,00:11:45.60,00:11:45.60,We can get out right here.
255,00:11:48.47,00:11:48.47,I got the slipknot right this time.
256,00:11:49.83,00:11:49.83,(chuckling)
257,00:11:50.93,00:11:50.93,"-All right. -Very nice, ladies."
258,00:11:52.63,00:11:52.63,Very good. Very good.
259,00:11:53.97,00:11:53.97,(whooping)
260,00:11:57.73,00:11:57.73,"All right, you guys, can I just"
261,00:11:59.93,00:11:59.93,-let you guys know something? -Yeah.
262,00:12:01.70,00:12:01.70,"Um, I-- it's not a big deal,"
263,00:12:04.37,00:12:04.37,"but I think it's something that every tribe member should know,"
264,00:12:07.00,00:12:07.00,and I want to try to do my best
265,00:12:08.23,00:12:08.23,"to keep it from the other tribe members,"
266,00:12:09.80,00:12:09.80,but I am deaf.
267,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,I can't hear.
268,00:12:13.10,00:12:13.10,I have a hearing aid in my one ear.
269,00:12:14.47,00:12:14.47,"Um, can't hear anything out of this ear."
270,00:12:16.90,00:12:16.90,"Um, I read lips. Um, nighttime..."
271,00:12:18.60,00:12:18.60,JANET: Christy has  a hearing disability.
272,00:12:20.50,00:12:20.50,"It took us by surprise, but she  just asked us to look at her"
273,00:12:23.90,00:12:23.90,and speak slowly so she could read our lips.
274,00:12:26.73,00:12:26.73,"You know, when we were on the boat and everyone was talking,"
275,00:12:29.10,00:12:29.10,"I have, like, no idea what your jobs are."
276,00:12:31.27,00:12:31.27,I have no idea what your names are or where you guys live.
277,00:12:34.30,00:12:34.30,-Deena. -Deena?
278,00:12:35.47,00:12:35.47,"-Deena. -Hi, Deena."
279,00:12:36.53,00:12:36.53,-Jeanne. -Jeanne.
280,00:12:38.53,00:12:38.53,"CHRISTY: I kind of told them  at the wrong time,"
281,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,but I needed to get it off my chest.
282,00:12:43.30,00:12:43.30,"Like I just couldn't, like, keep it in any longer."
283,00:12:46.47,00:12:46.47,-Heidi. -Heidi.
284,00:12:47.73,00:12:47.73,-Jenna. -Jenna.
285,00:12:49.30,00:12:49.30,JENNA: I'm just wondering  how she's going to be able
286,00:12:51.57,00:12:51.57, to work with a group when  she can't really hear well.
287,00:12:54.87,00:12:54.87,-I'm Janet. -Jan.
288,00:12:56.90,00:12:56.90,"I don't know how it's going to work out, I really don't."
289,00:12:59.50,00:12:59.50,"Well, that's all."
290,00:13:00.57,00:13:00.57,I just kind of wanted...
291,00:13:01.70,00:13:01.70,"No, that's important."
292,00:13:02.87,00:13:02.87,-I'm glad you told us right off the bat. -I know.
293,00:13:04.97,00:13:04.97,We promise not to tell the boys anything.
294,00:13:07.73,00:13:07.73,Let's see if we've got any food. Is anybody else...?
295,00:13:25.03,00:13:25.03,"Yeah, we want to be quite a ways from the water."
296,00:13:27.63,00:13:27.63,The higher up we go-- what do you guys think about that?
297,00:13:29.40,00:13:29.40,I'm asking your opinion.
298,00:13:30.73,00:13:30.73,That pretty much agree with everybody?
299,00:13:32.07,00:13:32.07,"The higher up we go, better off we are, too?"
300,00:13:34.07,00:13:34.07,"Not... well, but we also want to be able to get to water."
301,00:13:36.17,00:13:36.17,How about if we walk around and then we come back
302,00:13:37.90,00:13:37.90,"and share opinions, you know, so--"
303,00:13:39.53,00:13:39.53,Nobody wants to be a leader 'cause that's the first guy
304,00:13:41.30,00:13:41.30,"gets voted off, right?"
305,00:13:42.57,00:13:42.57,(laughter)
306,00:13:43.60,00:13:43.60,"So, why don't we come back--"
307,00:13:45.60,00:13:45.60,And here I am saying that. Uh...
308,00:13:47.87,00:13:47.87,ROB: Maybe you think  you meet a guy named Butch
309,00:13:49.43,00:13:49.43,from Illinois that's a redneck.
310,00:13:52.43,00:13:52.43,"You think he's not that sharp a guy, but he is."
311,00:13:55.00,00:13:55.00,I like Butch a lot.
312,00:13:59.77,00:13:59.77,ALEX:  We found a great spot.
313,00:14:01.33,00:14:01.33,"We found a pretty, you know, relatively level spot"
314,00:14:03.50,00:14:03.50,on a little bit higher ground.
315,00:14:05.00,00:14:05.00,What if we would use those two trees
316,00:14:08.13,00:14:08.13,as the back part of your hut
317,00:14:09.77,00:14:09.77,and bring something across? I don't know...
318,00:14:11.67,00:14:11.67,ALEX: We don't even need to bring anything across.
319,00:14:13.67,00:14:13.67,We can just clear that branch.
320,00:14:14.60,00:14:14.60,"It's already cleared, too, guys."
321,00:14:16.07,00:14:16.07,"ALEX: And, actually, there's a  little bit of a slope, too,"
322,00:14:17.67,00:14:17.67,"to where we are, so the water won't-won't"
323,00:14:20.33,00:14:20.33,puddle up where we are.
324,00:14:21.70,00:14:21.70,-So we got to get these logs out. -Right.
325,00:14:23.87,00:14:23.87,"Let's not get everybody doing it, though, you know?"
326,00:14:25.40,00:14:25.40,Two of us are going to go do the fire situation.
327,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,I think probably...
328,00:14:29.40,00:14:29.40,"Well, two can start clearing,"
329,00:14:31.03,00:14:31.03,"two can start, uh, trying to find palms for..."
330,00:14:33.10,00:14:33.10,"Well, actually, you know what? We don't need to"
331,00:14:35.03,00:14:35.03,do that till tomorrow. We just need a floor.
332,00:14:36.30,00:14:36.30,"-Alex, tonight, we're only going to get a platform. -Yeah, we..."
333,00:14:37.43,00:14:37.43,-Okay? -Let's do it.
334,00:14:38.53,00:14:38.53,We got trees right here that'll work.
335,00:14:57.00,00:14:57.00,That's good.
336,00:15:05.50,00:15:05.50,It's all good in the neighborhood.
337,00:15:07.83,00:15:07.83,"It's all gravy, baby."
338,00:15:09.30,00:15:09.30,I feel I missed my calling in life as a lumberjack.
339,00:15:12.67,00:15:12.67,Tell me if this is not kerosene.
340,00:15:14.67,00:15:14.67,That's kerosene; I can smell it from here.
341,00:15:16.57,00:15:16.57,"Okay, yeah, 'cause my smeller is gone; I can't tell you."
342,00:15:19.70,00:15:19.70,Yeah. Whew.
343,00:15:20.70,00:15:20.70,"You can tell by, you can tell by..."
344,00:15:22.23,00:15:22.23,"-By the crossbones, yeah. -(laughter)"
345,00:15:24.23,00:15:24.23,DAVE: Making the fire  was-was a piece of cake.
346,00:15:27.73,00:15:27.73,The reason being is that there was
347,00:15:28.97,00:15:28.97,"kerosene in the, in the lamps."
348,00:15:30.50,00:15:30.50, We were also given some flint  with the machetes
349,00:15:33.73,00:15:33.73, and had no problems  making a fire.
350,00:15:35.70,00:15:35.70,"-There you go. -You got it, you got it."
351,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,"Keep going, man."
352,00:15:39.20,00:15:39.20,-There you go. Perfect -Turn it.
353,00:15:40.67,00:15:40.67,Yeah. Toss that right on top.
354,00:15:43.03,00:15:43.03,Nice. Nice.
355,00:15:44.80,00:15:44.80,I wonder if the chicks have built their fire yet.
356,00:15:46.70,00:15:46.70,-I doubt it. -Probably.
357,00:15:50.20,00:15:50.20,I don't smoke...
358,00:15:51.23,00:15:51.23,"Come on, come on. Somebody do something."
359,00:15:52.47,00:15:52.47,"-Something. -Here, here, here."
360,00:15:53.83,00:15:53.83,"-Blow. -Here, here."
361,00:15:55.07,00:15:55.07,I need one of those big leaves.
362,00:15:56.67,00:15:56.67,Let's just fan it.
363,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,I fanned it.
364,00:16:04.73,00:16:04.73,Yep.
365,00:16:06.00,00:16:06.00,Keep going.
366,00:16:16.40,00:16:16.40,We almost got it.
367,00:16:20.23,00:16:20.23,SHAWNA: The fire was  an absolute fiasco.
368,00:16:22.60,00:16:22.60, The process was:
369,00:16:23.90,00:16:23.90,"get the little fire going, put on some leaves,"
370,00:16:26.30,00:16:26.30,"some other small stuff,"
371,00:16:27.87,00:16:27.87,"put on little sticks, put on bigger stuff,"
372,00:16:30.27,00:16:30.27,put on big logs.
373,00:16:31.63,00:16:31.63,-I think it stopped. -It's going out.
374,00:16:33.20,00:16:33.20,-(gasps) -Yeah.
375,00:16:34.30,00:16:34.30,It's going out. Why?
376,00:16:35.67,00:16:35.67,"-It's this stuff. -Blow, blow."
377,00:16:37.13,00:16:37.13,SHAWNA:  None of this happened.
378,00:16:38.60,00:16:38.60, It was ridiculous.
379,00:16:40.20,00:16:40.20,"Obviously, it's a lack of fire- building skills on our part."
380,00:16:45.57,00:16:45.57,It's dead.
381,00:16:46.63,00:16:46.63,What is doing that?
382,00:16:48.40,00:16:48.40,"Hey, guys, we need to have a little team meeting."
383,00:16:51.23,00:16:51.23,We need to decide what's really important
384,00:16:53.53,00:16:53.53,"for this first night here, on this bug-infested,"
385,00:16:55.90,00:16:55.90,"fly-infested, wasp-infested area."
386,00:16:58.63,00:16:58.63,"For me, it is something to sleep on."
387,00:17:00.93,00:17:00.93,So how would you suggest we do that?
388,00:17:03.20,00:17:03.20,HEIDI:  Deena-- she definitely has
389,00:17:04.70,00:17:04.70, more of a bossy side to her.
390,00:17:05.93,00:17:05.93," Like, if six of us"
391,00:17:07.30,00:17:07.30,"come up with a good idea, she would be the one to say,"
392,00:17:09.93,00:17:09.93,"""I don't think that'll work; we better do something else."""
393,00:17:12.13,00:17:12.13,I don't want to sleep on the floor.
394,00:17:14.53,00:17:14.53,We could split.
395,00:17:15.70,00:17:15.70,"Just, like, half do fire, half do shelter."
396,00:17:18.33,00:17:18.33,So let's split.
397,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,-Half will work on the fire... -I'll work on the shelter.
398,00:17:20.73,00:17:20.73,and get the logs ready for the fire--
399,00:17:22.50,00:17:22.50,the other half work on the shelter?
400,00:17:24.53,00:17:24.53,-Yeah. -Okay.
401,00:17:31.87,00:17:31.87,Timber. Clear.
402,00:17:37.43,00:17:37.43,It's stuck.
403,00:17:42.33,00:17:42.33,Ah...
404,00:17:46.47,00:17:46.47,JEANNE:  It's okay.
405,00:17:47.47,00:17:47.47,We're Amazon women.
406,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,We'll make it.
407,00:17:51.10,00:17:51.10,Go...
408,00:17:52.10,00:17:52.10,(grunts)
409,00:17:53.63,00:17:53.63,"Oh, my God."
410,00:17:55.70,00:17:55.70, We'll toughen up and we'll  make it through to the end.
411,00:17:57.70,00:17:57.70,Kick the guys' butt.
412,00:18:10.13,00:18:10.13,"RYAN: Hey, guys, what do you think of our bed, dude?"
413,00:18:12.03,00:18:12.03,All right.
414,00:18:13.17,00:18:13.17,"Hey, that looks a..."
415,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,-That looks pretty damn comfortable. -Look at the bed!
416,00:18:16.77,00:18:16.77,How is it?
417,00:18:18.23,00:18:18.23,Not... not bad.
418,00:18:20.30,00:18:20.30,Butch has got his...
419,00:18:21.97,00:18:21.97,"Here's my, um, here's my thing that I got."
420,00:18:24.27,00:18:24.27,"And it, it, uh-- I wanted to explain it to you,"
421,00:18:26.03,00:18:26.03,'cause it's kind of corny.
422,00:18:27.23,00:18:27.23,"Uh, I'm in the kid business, and I have--"
423,00:18:29.27,00:18:29.27,I deal with 500 middle school kids every day.
424,00:18:31.03,00:18:31.03,And I have a lot of kids nowadays that are not like us.
425,00:18:33.37,00:18:33.37,They're not dreamers.
426,00:18:34.37,00:18:34.37,They have no goals.
427,00:18:35.87,00:18:35.87,And they just don't believe in themselves.
428,00:18:37.83,00:18:37.83,"So I had a banner hanging up in my school,"
429,00:18:39.80,00:18:39.80,and I brought the banner.
430,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,"And it says, each one of us..."
431,00:18:42.33,00:18:42.33,"""Believe In Yourself."""
432,00:18:44.07,00:18:44.07,-I'm down. -Put it up!
433,00:18:45.60,00:18:45.60,DAVE: Butch had  a fantastic luxury item.
434,00:18:47.43,00:18:47.43,"It's a fabulous motto, you know?"
435,00:18:49.67,00:18:49.67,"It's something to,"
436,00:18:50.77,00:18:50.77, to really think about.
437,00:18:52.03,00:18:52.03,"Hey, believe in yourself, right?"
438,00:18:54.50,00:18:54.50,"One, two, three..."
439,00:18:55.50,00:18:55.50,ALL: Believe in yourself!
440,00:18:56.77,00:18:56.77,-Hoorah! -Believe in yourself.
441,00:18:57.93,00:18:57.93,Tambaqui.
442,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,-Tambaqui? -It's Tambaqui!
443,00:19:01.00,00:19:01.00,"If it rained, we could cover the wood with this."
444,00:19:03.60,00:19:03.60,"ROB: I think, as a whole,  we've gotten along very well,"
445,00:19:07.10,00:19:07.10,but I think that the women have got to be having
446,00:19:09.40,00:19:09.40,a very difficult time.
447,00:19:11.47,00:19:11.47," And especially, they're not  going to catch any fish."
448,00:19:13.67,00:19:13.67, We got expert fishermen  out there
449,00:19:15.20,00:19:15.20, and we haven't  caught anything yet.
450,00:19:16.50,00:19:16.50, I don't think any of them  had any idea
451,00:19:19.23,00:19:19.23, they'd be doing this  on estrogen alone
452,00:19:21.53,00:19:21.53,"over there in, in, uh, Camp of the Vagina Monologue."
453,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17,"By tomorrow night, we'll be light-years ahead of"
454,00:19:28.77,00:19:28.77,where they are.
455,00:19:29.90,00:19:29.90,There is no way that that group collectively
456,00:19:32.27,00:19:32.27,is halfway where we are.
457,00:19:34.23,00:19:34.23,I just can't see it.
458,00:19:45.57,00:19:45.57,Blow on it.
459,00:19:46.57,00:19:46.57,Blow on it.
460,00:19:48.33,00:19:48.33,-There we go. -All right.
461,00:19:50.00,00:19:50.00,"Oh, you're a lifesaver with this one."
462,00:19:51.87,00:19:51.87,DEENA:  It took us five or six hours
463,00:19:54.50,00:19:54.50, to get the fire really going.
464,00:19:56.33,00:19:56.33," And by the time  it got pitch black,"
465,00:19:58.03,00:19:58.03, we had really  only cut four logs.
466,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10," So we all sat there  in front of the fire,"
467,00:20:03.67,00:20:03.67,which was now starting to grow a little bit larger;
468,00:20:05.83,00:20:05.83,people were a little bit more comfortable.
469,00:20:07.27,00:20:07.27,We lighted the kerosene so it wouldn't be
470,00:20:08.93,00:20:08.93,quite so dark out there.
471,00:20:10.07,00:20:10.07,-What is that? -What?
472,00:20:11.97,00:20:11.97,See it.
473,00:20:13.03,00:20:13.03,-What is it? -It's a leaf.
474,00:20:14.77,00:20:14.77,See the shadow of the leaf?
475,00:20:16.00,00:20:16.00,"No, go a little further."
476,00:20:17.10,00:20:17.10,I'm telling you.
477,00:20:18.10,00:20:18.10,It's the shadow of the leaf.
478,00:20:20.00,00:20:20.00," DEENA: We huddled as close  to the fire as we could,"
479,00:20:22.07,00:20:22.07, and we decided  that we were going to
480,00:20:23.67,00:20:23.67, watch the fire in shifts  that night.
481,00:20:25.33,00:20:25.33,But all we did was a major bag fest on the boy team
482,00:20:29.10,00:20:29.10,for most of the night.
483,00:20:30.73,00:20:30.73,-The boys are talking about... -How they get off.
484,00:20:32.87,00:20:32.87,-(laughter) -Oh!
485,00:20:34.47,00:20:34.47,What are they talking about?
486,00:20:35.83,00:20:35.83,They're talking about how they can't believe
487,00:20:37.50,00:20:37.50,that you two aren't in your bathing suits.
488,00:20:39.10,00:20:39.10,Did you notice the guys staring at Heidi
489,00:20:40.80,00:20:40.80,when they got on the boat?
490,00:20:42.10,00:20:42.10,"He was like-- it was, like, a long..."
491,00:20:43.27,00:20:43.27,(laughter)
492,00:20:44.10,00:20:44.10,"Just like, ""No!"
493,00:20:45.50,00:20:45.50,"Don't take her from me."""
494,00:20:47.20,00:20:47.20,"""I wanted to look at your hooters all day."""
495,00:20:48.53,00:20:48.53,(laughter)
496,00:20:50.43,00:20:50.43,"CHRISTY:  As soon as it gets dark,"
497,00:20:53.63,00:20:53.63," that's where my whole  communication just shuts down,"
498,00:20:57.80,00:20:57.80, because I can't see.
499,00:21:00.17,00:21:00.17, I can't read their lips.
500,00:21:06.17,00:21:06.17," And it's, like, God, of course"
501,00:21:07.93,00:21:07.93,I'm in a group of girls who like to
502,00:21:09.80,00:21:09.80,"talk and talk and talk and talk, you know?"
503,00:21:12.30,00:21:12.30,So it's like...
504,00:21:14.13,00:21:14.13,So I'm missing out on a lot of their information.
505,00:21:17.07,00:21:17.07,"We want to eat, or do we want a shelter?"
506,00:21:19.07,00:21:19.07,"I think we better eat, or we're going to start collapsing."
507,00:21:21.73,00:21:21.73,"CHRISTY:   I'll try to be with them,"
508,00:21:23.23,00:21:23.23, but I can never be like them  'cause I'm not.
509,00:21:26.33,00:21:26.33, I'm always totally different.
510,00:21:28.33,00:21:28.33, It always happens.
511,00:21:29.67,00:21:29.67,That's okay. That's okay.
512,00:21:31.90,00:21:31.90,It happens every time.
513,00:21:33.40,00:21:33.40,"It's just like, I'm at a big disadvantage."
514,00:21:38.63,00:21:38.63,"Oh, no!"
515,00:21:39.70,00:21:39.70,"I said, ""No! Are you out of your mind?"""
516,00:21:41.57,00:21:41.57,"I'm not eating someone else's, like, order."
517,00:21:45.10,00:21:45.10,(chuckles)
518,00:21:46.40,00:21:46.40,Is Christy sleeping over there?
519,00:21:47.90,00:21:47.90,"-Yeah, she is. She's out. -Is she?"
520,00:21:50.50,00:21:50.50,"-Night, ladies. -Good night."
521,00:21:51.87,00:21:51.87,-Good night. -How you feeling?
522,00:22:11.13,00:22:11.13,JENNA: The Amazon women tribe  is not doing very well.
523,00:22:14.83,00:22:14.83," We slept on the ground, which  is, like, the number one rule"
524,00:22:17.40,00:22:17.40, not to do in the jungle.
525,00:22:18.97,00:22:18.97, And it was awful.
526,00:22:20.57,00:22:20.57, We had bugs  crawling all over us.
527,00:22:22.93,00:22:22.93,Something was always biting you
528,00:22:24.40,00:22:24.40,or crawling down your pants or crawling in your hair.
529,00:22:26.77,00:22:26.77,I don't like when they fly directly into your eyeball.
530,00:22:29.50,00:22:29.50,Or right up your nose. I had that this morning.
531,00:22:31.07,00:22:31.07,"Yeah, I saw that."
532,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,"JANET: There was leeches, big spiders."
533,00:22:35.50,00:22:35.50,We all got bit.
534,00:22:39.23,00:22:39.23,"Here, give me the machete."
535,00:22:40.43,00:22:40.43,"Oh, my goodness."
536,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,"I can't believe that's right there,"
537,00:22:43.30,00:22:43.30,and we've been sleeping right there.
538,00:22:44.57,00:22:44.57,"Maybe if we just leave it alone, it'll go away."
539,00:22:46.60,00:22:46.60,"No, I want it dead."
540,00:22:48.17,00:22:48.17,That's a reality check.
541,00:22:49.73,00:22:49.73,"Last night, that big spider dropped down."
542,00:22:51.50,00:22:51.50,"Oh, you're right."
543,00:22:52.50,00:22:52.50,And it was something huge.
544,00:22:53.80,00:22:53.80,JENNA: We found  a tarantula that morning.
545,00:22:56.17,00:22:56.17, It fell on someone that night.
546,00:22:57.67,00:22:57.67,"So, obviously, it probably climbed over all of us."
547,00:22:59.33,00:22:59.33,Just get it.
548,00:23:00.40,00:23:00.40,"It's in the food now, girls."
549,00:23:02.40,00:23:02.40,-Oh... -It went into our stuff; that's what it's after.
550,00:23:04.23,00:23:04.23,"Oh, he went into the food."
551,00:23:05.47,00:23:05.47,-Maybe the net. -Is he in there? Really?
552,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,He's right there.
553,00:23:08.70,00:23:08.70,"Oh, step away."
554,00:23:09.70,00:23:09.70,It's hollow though underneath.
555,00:23:11.13,00:23:11.13,"-He's probably underneath it. -Well, that's okay."
556,00:23:12.57,00:23:12.57,"-Okay, he is. -Lift it up. -Who's got the machete?"
557,00:23:14.17,00:23:14.17,-Here. -Are you ready?
558,00:23:15.80,00:23:15.80,Don't both of you hit each other.
559,00:23:17.70,00:23:17.70,-Wow! -I got him.
560,00:23:18.93,00:23:18.93,"-Oh, yay! -Put him in the fire."
561,00:23:20.70,00:23:20.70,All right.
562,00:23:21.87,00:23:21.87,"Whoo, Ja-ru!"
563,00:23:22.90,00:23:22.90,All right.
564,00:23:24.00,00:23:24.00,(excited chatter)
565,00:23:27.13,00:23:27.13,CHRISTY: We were sleeping  on that ground.
566,00:23:29.30,00:23:29.30,Wow.
567,00:23:30.53,00:23:30.53,(laughs)
568,00:23:31.97,00:23:31.97,Makes you wonder what went in your mouth.
569,00:23:35.00,00:23:35.00,We don't even have to make our own
570,00:23:36.10,00:23:36.10,stinking fishing line. Look at that.
571,00:23:37.23,00:23:37.23,"DEENA: I think all of us realized that it was cold, wet,"
572,00:23:40.37,00:23:40.37," miserable and uncomfortable,  and there's bugs, so first and"
573,00:23:44.23,00:23:44.23,"foremost, we needed to get a shelter."
574,00:23:46.33,00:23:46.33,We could do it in shifts.
575,00:23:48.33,00:23:48.33,"Six and two-- like, six on the shelter"
576,00:23:49.90,00:23:49.90,and two at-at food gathering or something.
577,00:23:52.90,00:23:52.90,Everybody ready to go check this out?
578,00:23:54.07,00:23:54.07,"-Wait a minute. No, we're missing Heidi. -Yeah."
579,00:23:55.63,00:23:55.63,"-She's coming. -Oh, we're still missing Heidi?"
580,00:23:57.40,00:23:57.40,Are you good?
581,00:23:58.40,00:23:58.40,"Okay. Sorry, girls."
582,00:24:00.57,00:24:00.57,All right.
583,00:24:00.87,00:24:00.87,"So we go back to the boat, right?"
584,00:24:11.73,00:24:11.73,"CHRISTY: They all kind of  started to have this, like,"
585,00:24:14.23,00:24:14.23," mission or whatever, and I was  like, man, what's going on?"
586,00:24:17.27,00:24:17.27," I'm like, okay,  I'll watch the fire."
587,00:24:19.23,00:24:19.23," And at the same time,  I was like,"
588,00:24:20.90,00:24:20.90,"""Well, doesn't anybody care"
589,00:24:23.03,00:24:23.03,"that I'm the only one out here, you know?"""
590,00:24:28.57,00:24:28.57,HEIDI: I haven't really  bonded with Christy
591,00:24:31.60,00:24:31.60, just because of  the communication barrier.
592,00:24:34.30,00:24:34.30,"If you can't understand all the people around you,"
593,00:24:37.47,00:24:37.47,it's hard to make that communication.
594,00:24:39.47,00:24:39.47,So that-that is definitely more of a liability right now.
595,00:24:45.70,00:24:45.70,CHRISTY: It's not like  this is new to me.
596,00:24:48.47,00:24:48.47, This is what a deaf person  has to go through.
597,00:24:51.30,00:24:51.30, It's an everyday struggle.
598,00:24:53.87,00:24:53.87, But I don't want it to be  an issue every day.
599,00:24:57.30,00:24:57.30,"'Cause if it becomes an issue every day,"
600,00:24:59.07,00:24:59.07,"then they're going to be like,"
601,00:25:00.53,00:25:00.53,"""Well, why do we need this person,"" you know?"
602,00:25:03.73,00:25:03.73," So I'm still, like,  trying to figure out how to"
603,00:25:06.47,00:25:06.47,work with these women.
604,00:25:08.00,00:25:08.00,(laughs)
605,00:25:19.27,00:25:19.27,"These two, maybe, as the front of our shelter"
606,00:25:21.53,00:25:21.53,and built back that way.
607,00:25:23.37,00:25:23.37,"Yeah, this is the back and that is the front."
608,00:25:25.37,00:25:25.37,-Put two posts here. -Yeah.
609,00:25:26.60,00:25:26.60,"We put in, uh,"
610,00:25:27.87,00:25:27.87,"six of those, uh, ""Y,"" letter ""Y"" shape supports,"
611,00:25:32.07,00:25:32.07,-and we just do the floors. -We need them about
612,00:25:33.83,00:25:33.83,"three feet long, the ""Y's."""
613,00:25:34.83,00:25:34.83,And there should be plenty of them.
614,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,"You just see a tree. They're all over, like--"
615,00:25:37.40,00:25:37.40,"There's one with a ""Y."""
616,00:25:38.63,00:25:38.63,"They don't have to be real strong at the fork,"
617,00:25:40.70,00:25:40.70,"but we got to have those ""Y's."""
618,00:25:42.00,00:25:42.00,-Right. -Okay?
619,00:25:43.07,00:25:43.07,ROB: Roger definitely is very bossy.
620,00:25:44.40,00:25:44.40," You know, when we were  building the shelter,"
621,00:25:45.90,00:25:45.90," he's telling people,  and especially telling kids,"
622,00:25:48.10,00:25:48.10," which is mostly this tribe,"
623,00:25:49.47,00:25:49.47,"uh, you know, telling them, ""Go do this, go do that."""
624,00:25:52.70,00:25:52.70,"Ryan, you want to stoke that fire out,"
625,00:25:55.50,00:25:55.50,"check that water, see if it's boiling, please."
626,00:25:58.13,00:25:58.13,ROB:  I know how to play this game.
627,00:26:00.30,00:26:00.30,"I say, ""Yes, Roger. Yes, Roger.  Sure, Roger."""
628,00:26:04.70,00:26:04.70,I just go and do it.
629,00:26:06.20,00:26:06.20,"But, uh, it doesn't-doesn't bother me too much."
630,00:26:08.27,00:26:08.27,"Why don't we stay, keep it tight on this end,"
631,00:26:10.57,00:26:10.57,"and then as we keep-- as we taper out,"
632,00:26:13.00,00:26:13.00,-Yeah. -we'll just put more on that side.
633,00:26:15.00,00:26:15.00,Yeah. We'll worry about it later.
634,00:26:19.03,00:26:19.03,"ROGER: This kid Ryan  and the kid Daniel,"
635,00:26:21.70,00:26:21.70,"uh, they're just not contributing."
636,00:26:24.53,00:26:24.53," You know, you ask them to do  stuff and they just--"
637,00:26:27.00,00:26:27.00, they're talking to each other
638,00:26:28.23,00:26:28.23, and they're just  floating around.
639,00:26:29.47,00:26:29.47,"Well, y-your two boys haven't even moved."
640,00:26:33.27,00:26:33.27,I've already made up my mind on that score.
641,00:26:35.47,00:26:35.47,(laughter)
642,00:26:37.13,00:26:37.13," And building the shelter,  these guys--"
643,00:26:38.60,00:26:38.60,"we asked them to go out and get some vines,"
644,00:26:40.37,00:26:40.37,"and, I mean, it's like pulling, pulling teeth."
645,00:26:42.37,00:26:42.37,"One, two, three."
646,00:26:44.80,00:26:44.80,(groaning)
647,00:26:46.97,00:26:46.97, They're just useless.
648,00:26:48.10,00:26:48.10, They're digging  their own grave.
649,00:26:49.30,00:26:49.30, They've already dug it.
650,00:26:53.63,00:26:53.63,"Whew, that's, that's looking good right there."
651,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,A little sun's coming down.
652,00:26:58.57,00:26:58.57,It's gonna be a lot better than that.
653,00:27:00.37,00:27:00.37,"We built an interesting-- we're calling it, um,"
654,00:27:02.53,00:27:02.53,our postmodern survivor for survival shelter.
655,00:27:05.60,00:27:05.60, It's not a perfect square.
656,00:27:06.70,00:27:06.70, We got a little  trapezoid action going
657,00:27:07.93,00:27:07.93, and some different planes.
658,00:27:09.60,00:27:09.60," It's gonna be,  it's gonna be very nice."
659,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,I think I'm really relatively sure
660,00:27:13.40,00:27:13.40, Home and Garden is gonna come and shoot us later.
661,00:27:15.93,00:27:15.93,"I just think about what the girls are going through, man."
662,00:27:18.67,00:27:18.67,I find it really hard to believe that they're doing this.
663,00:27:20.63,00:27:20.63,"I mean, and they might be, they probably are, but..."
664,00:27:22.30,00:27:22.30," I don't know, man."
665,00:27:23.50,00:27:23.50,I-I can't imagine them actually
666,00:27:25.23,00:27:25.23,dismantling the jungle like we have
667,00:27:26.67,00:27:26.67,and actually building shelter.
668,00:27:30.10,00:27:30.10,ROB: I don't see the women  working well together.
669,00:27:32.20,00:27:32.20, I know that their shelter  is not going to be
670,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83, as good as ours.
671,00:27:35.13,00:27:35.13," I see them all crying  and panicking,"
672,00:27:37.27,00:27:37.27,"trying to build a, build a cell phone so they can"
673,00:27:40.40,00:27:40.40,call their boyfriends to come over
674,00:27:42.00,00:27:42.00,"and help them build, build the shelter."
675,00:27:43.90,00:27:43.90," Outside of that,  I'm sure they've got"
676,00:27:45.47,00:27:45.47, maybe three sticks together.
677,00:27:46.73,00:27:46.73,ALL: Tambaqui!
678,00:27:47.90,00:27:47.90,(cheering)
679,00:27:49.73,00:27:49.73,Like the eight musketeers.
680,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,(indistinct voices)
681,00:28:03.47,00:28:03.47,Right there.
682,00:28:06.50,00:28:06.50,-(groans) -Push it down.
683,00:28:07.83,00:28:07.83,-We're gonna try to... -Okay.
684,00:28:09.07,00:28:09.07,Put another one under it?
685,00:28:10.40,00:28:10.40,"Oh, like, under which part?"
686,00:28:12.30,00:28:12.30,"Oh, she's trying to fill that in."
687,00:28:13.77,00:28:13.77,We need big holes for those.
688,00:28:15.13,00:28:15.13,"Oh, okay, I see what you're saying."
689,00:28:16.50,00:28:16.50,JEANNE: I thought we'd be more focused.
690,00:28:18.47,00:28:18.47, I thought someone would  take the leadership role.
691,00:28:20.23,00:28:20.23,"But, you know, this is in here pretty sturdy."
692,00:28:22.23,00:28:22.23,We may have to adjust that middle one
693,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,'cause it's in here pretty good.
694,00:28:24.47,00:28:24.47," But we look disorganized,"
695,00:28:25.47,00:28:25.47,and we're not functioning well.
696,00:28:26.80,00:28:26.80," And considering  the group we have,"
697,00:28:29.33,00:28:29.33,"it's embarrassing, I think."
698,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10,Downright embarrassing.
699,00:28:32.43,00:28:32.43,"We might be able to do something like that, you know?"
700,00:28:39.23,00:28:39.23,Is the water done?
701,00:28:40.73,00:28:40.73,No.
702,00:28:41.73,00:28:41.73, Everyone's dehydrated.
703,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,No one went to the bathroom yesterday.
704,00:28:45.73,00:28:45.73, People are going to start  getting down.
705,00:28:51.50,00:28:51.50,JENNA: The flies are swarming us  because we stink.
706,00:28:54.40,00:28:54.40," So we boiled our buffs,"
707,00:28:56.30,00:28:56.30, we boiled underwear  that wasn't clean.
708,00:28:59.50,00:28:59.50,Underwear needs to be clean.
709,00:29:01.07,00:29:01.07,I figure-- I think it's a priority because of...
710,00:29:04.07,00:29:04.07,"it's, you know, it's-- things can live on you,"
711,00:29:06.80,00:29:06.80,especially in that area 'cause it's dark.
712,00:29:10.97,00:29:10.97,They should be cooled down a little bit more than these ones
713,00:29:13.70,00:29:13.70,'cause I took them out a little while ago.
714,00:29:15.83,00:29:15.83,DEENA:  We're having a difficult time
715,00:29:17.73,00:29:17.73," getting our tasks in order,"
716,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17, completing them and moving on  to the next project.
717,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67," It's a ""I'm kind of  feeling like"
718,00:29:24.23,00:29:24.23," I need to wash my buff now,""  so we wash the buffs."
719,00:29:28.73,00:29:28.73,I'm thinking shelter.
720,00:29:31.23,00:29:31.23,CHRISTY: Somebody boiled water.
721,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,I don't know what it was boiled for.
722,00:29:35.27,00:29:35.27,I think they boiled it to wash their clothes in.
723,00:29:37.67,00:29:37.67,I think it was for clothes.
724,00:29:40.07,00:29:40.07,'Cause you know it's a priority here.
725,00:29:42.20,00:29:42.20,"Got to have fresh, fresh buffs."
726,00:29:44.83,00:29:44.83,And panties.
727,00:29:45.97,00:29:45.97,CHRISTY: Whatever.
728,00:29:47.37,00:29:47.37,Buffs.
729,00:29:53.40,00:29:53.40,(sighs): Hoy.
730,00:30:05.47,00:30:05.47,(thunder rumbling softly)
731,00:30:13.33,00:30:13.33,"Man, this thing is just heavy."
732,00:30:15.40,00:30:15.40,-I know. -Wow.
733,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,Okay...
734,00:30:19.03,00:30:19.03,There's a breeze here.
735,00:30:22.30,00:30:22.30,"JENNA: Me and Heidi and Janet  went fishing, using the net."
736,00:30:25.83,00:30:25.83, And Janet--
737,00:30:26.83,00:30:26.83,she's very sick.
738,00:30:28.20,00:30:28.20,She's not doing well at all.
739,00:30:29.87,00:30:29.87,I'm about ready to pass out.
740,00:30:31.00,00:30:31.00,(Jenna murmurs)
741,00:30:32.10,00:30:32.10,I'm not going to make it to a challenge
742,00:30:34.33,00:30:34.33,or anything else if I don't...
743,00:30:36.13,00:30:36.13,This is too hard.
744,00:30:37.13,00:30:37.13,We can't live on that stuff.
745,00:30:38.77,00:30:38.77,That's just not going to work.
746,00:30:46.30,00:30:46.30,JENNA:  She just kind of did nothing.
747,00:30:48.80,00:30:48.80, She just kind of sat there  on the boat and just said
748,00:30:51.40,00:30:51.40, she didn't want  to paddle out far because
749,00:30:53.70,00:30:53.70,she didn't want to have to paddle far back.
750,00:30:55.43,00:30:55.43,"It's just... it's-it's, like, up and down."
751,00:30:57.87,00:30:57.87,"I mean, she's mostly down."
752,00:30:59.43,00:30:59.43, And that's probably  really going to hurt her.
753,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33," If we lose the challenge,  she might go."
754,00:31:03.03,00:31:03.03,I've had it. I can't...
755,00:31:04.70,00:31:04.70,You get a nice vacation.
756,00:31:05.87,00:31:05.87,I can't do this anymore.
757,00:31:07.27,00:31:07.27,JANET:  I hit rock bottom today.
758,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,"You know, we were going out"
759,00:31:10.80,00:31:10.80,"to fish or whatever, which is silly."
760,00:31:12.23,00:31:12.23,"It's not-- you know, we're not successful at it."
761,00:31:14.07,00:31:14.07,"Oh, look, we caught a leaf."
762,00:31:17.20,00:31:17.20,"Oh, great."
763,00:31:18.93,00:31:18.93,"Man, the toughest part about this whole experience,"
764,00:31:21.53,00:31:21.53,I didn't realize how tough it was physically.
765,00:31:23.77,00:31:23.77, I think that it's brutal.
766,00:31:25.43,00:31:25.43, Downright brutal.
767,00:31:27.10,00:31:27.10, And I didn't plan on that.
768,00:31:28.63,00:31:28.63," I mean, I planned it on being  difficult, but not brutal."
769,00:31:31.10,00:31:31.10,This is incredible.
770,00:31:32.77,00:31:32.77,You okay?
771,00:31:34.37,00:31:34.37,No.
772,00:31:35.77,00:31:35.77,"What's hurting you the most,"
773,00:31:36.87,00:31:36.87,the hunger or the-the feeling sick?
774,00:31:38.10,00:31:38.10,Or both?
775,00:31:39.53,00:31:39.53,I think she's just sick.
776,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,-You know what? -(sniffles)
777,00:31:43.53,00:31:43.53,"When you're-- I mean, imagine how you and I feel,"
778,00:31:45.97,00:31:45.97,and we're not sick.
779,00:31:47.43,00:31:47.43,-I know. -I'm about ready to
780,00:31:49.33,00:31:49.33,(chuckles): just keel over any second.
781,00:31:52.50,00:31:52.50,And you're also 20 years younger.
782,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,"JANET: Right now, I feel like I could throw up at any moment."
783,00:31:58.07,00:31:58.07, I-I'm just spent.
784,00:31:59.10,00:31:59.10, I'm physically--
785,00:32:00.67,00:32:00.67,I don't think I've ever been this physically exhausted.
786,00:32:03.70,00:32:03.70,I don't know if I can do a challenge.
787,00:32:05.70,00:32:05.70,I'm having trouble walking.
788,00:32:07.93,00:32:07.93,(sniffles)
789,00:32:24.73,00:32:24.73,For all those who have some questions
790,00:32:27.77,00:32:27.77,-in this lifetime... -Mm-hmm.
791,00:32:29.77,00:32:29.77,...I'm donating the Magic 8 Ball.
792,00:32:32.10,00:32:32.10,-To Tambaqui! -Butch...
793,00:32:33.83,00:32:33.83,ROB: My luxury item  was the Magic 8 Ball.
794,00:32:36.57,00:32:36.57, The Magic 8 Ball is a really  good thing to have out here.
795,00:32:39.77,00:32:39.77,"Well, one thing that you may or may not know"
796,00:32:43.13,00:32:43.13,is that it really works.
797,00:32:45.40,00:32:45.40,Are we going to win immunity?
798,00:32:46.87,00:32:46.87,-Do not ask... -(clamoring)
799,00:32:48.53,00:32:48.53,-No! -Time-out. -Go ahead!
800,00:32:50.50,00:32:50.50,We do not ask the Magic 8 Ball questions like that.
801,00:32:54.73,00:32:54.73,"I told the tribe there was only one rule with the Magic 8 Ball,"
802,00:32:58.13,00:32:58.13,and that was that they cannot ask it
803,00:33:00.47,00:33:00.47,whether we will win or lose challenges.
804,00:33:02.50,00:33:02.50,"If it says that we're going to lose and we win,"
805,00:33:05.67,00:33:05.67,then we'll know the Magic 8 Ball is a sham.
806,00:33:08.13,00:33:08.13,"And if it says that we're going to lose and we do lose,"
807,00:33:10.47,00:33:10.47,then it will freak us out.
808,00:33:12.70,00:33:12.70,So there's no point in asking questions like that.
809,00:33:15.10,00:33:15.10,We asked it a bunch of different things.
810,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,A lot of the talk around the tribe
811,00:33:18.23,00:33:18.23,is centered around the girls' tribe.
812,00:33:19.80,00:33:19.80," Basically, uh, three girls  in the girls' tribe:"
813,00:33:24.97,00:33:24.97," Shawna, Jenna and Heidi."
814,00:33:27.43,00:33:27.43,"Dude, is our boy Ryan gonna get with..."
815,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,gonna get a little something from young Jenna?
816,00:33:32.47,00:33:32.47,"-Yeah, ask that. -Nope."
817,00:33:33.90,00:33:33.90,"-""Most likely!"" -""Most likely!"""
818,00:33:35.03,00:33:35.03,"Nice, yo!"
819,00:33:37.47,00:33:37.47,"I said, Magic 8 Ball, will I hook up with Shawna?"
820,00:33:40.40,00:33:40.40,"-I'm... -No, no, look what it says."
821,00:33:42.20,00:33:42.20,"-""Yes, definitely."" -""Definitely."""
822,00:33:43.67,00:33:43.67,"ROGER:  This whole macho thing,"
823,00:33:44.90,00:33:44.90," you know, to listen to  these young guys,"
824,00:33:46.30,00:33:46.30," I mean, all they talk about  is women"
825,00:33:48.23,00:33:48.23," and, you know,  how good they're looking."
826,00:33:49.73,00:33:49.73," And they're talking,  these young guys especially."
827,00:33:51.70,00:33:51.70,The juices flow and y-you--
828,00:33:54.10,00:33:54.10,That's the way it is. That's...
829,00:33:55.93,00:33:55.93,"You know, boys from 15 on, that's all we think about."
830,00:33:58.07,00:33:58.07,"Magic 8 Ball, will I get together with Heidi?"
831,00:34:03.13,00:34:03.13,ROB:  That girl Heidi--
832,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40,she is so hot.
833,00:34:06.57,00:34:06.57,She could put Viagra out of business.
834,00:34:08.63,00:34:08.63,"""Signs point to yes."""
835,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,"-Woo-hoo. -Hook it up, hook it up."
836,00:34:12.03,00:34:12.03,Good job.
837,00:34:13.13,00:34:13.13," There are spirits  in this jungle,"
838,00:34:15.30,00:34:15.30,"and through the magic of the Magic 8 Ball,"
839,00:34:17.90,00:34:17.90,I can channel and harness those spirits.
840,00:34:20.63,00:34:20.63,All right.
841,00:34:34.13,00:34:34.13,JEANNE:  Joanna and I went on
842,00:34:35.43,00:34:35.43, a little fishing expedition  this morning.
843,00:34:37.03,00:34:37.03, We have a net.
844,00:34:39.70,00:34:39.70,"We placed it, um, in the little stream that we have here,"
845,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,with intentions of catching some big fish.
846,00:34:45.53,00:34:45.53,JOANNA: He just stuck.
847,00:34:46.87,00:34:46.87,"I mean, he is stuck good, too."
848,00:34:48.43,00:34:48.43,Ow.
849,00:34:49.43,00:34:49.43,"See, and then this net is"
850,00:34:50.70,00:34:50.70,"sticking onto their fin, so..."
851,00:34:52.43,00:34:52.43,You know what? I got a knife.
852,00:34:53.97,00:34:53.97,JEANNE: The only thing we found  was some bait.
853,00:34:56.47,00:34:56.47,"It was, like, really hard shell horn pout."
854,00:34:58.80,00:34:58.80,Ow.
855,00:35:00.27,00:35:00.27,-He's real... -He's wicked pointy.
856,00:35:02.53,00:35:02.53,It had sharpy... spines all over it.
857,00:35:05.80,00:35:05.80,"-No, you're going to have to smash him. -Oh!"
858,00:35:07.23,00:35:07.23,You can't just hit him like that.
859,00:35:08.33,00:35:08.33,"Well, here, smash him."
860,00:35:10.63,00:35:10.63,One knock and he out.
861,00:35:11.87,00:35:11.87,Look at there. See his tail.
862,00:35:13.17,00:35:13.17,I don't even think a fish would eat this fish.
863,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,-(chuckles) -We got bait.
864,00:35:16.63,00:35:16.63,We got bait.
865,00:35:18.93,00:35:18.93,\xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah! \xe2\x99\xaa
866,00:35:22.30,00:35:22.30,"\xe2\x99\xaa O, glory! \xe2\x99\xaa"
867,00:35:24.00,00:35:24.00,We caught some bait in the net and then we chopped it up.
868,00:35:28.10,00:35:28.10,We put it on
869,00:35:29.10,00:35:29.10, our fishing poles.
870,00:35:33.00,00:35:33.00,Please tell me we didn't leave the paddles over there.
871,00:35:35.87,00:35:35.87,JOANNA: We got over here  and got excited
872,00:35:38.87,00:35:38.87,about getting fish and left the oars.
873,00:35:43.37,00:35:43.37,I got it in my hand.
874,00:35:45.37,00:35:45.37,"-Thank you, Father. -Okay."
875,00:35:47.97,00:35:47.97,-All right. -Okay.
876,00:35:49.37,00:35:49.37,Now we're cooking.
877,00:35:50.37,00:35:50.37,"\xe2\x99\xaa Jaburu, Jaburu \xe2\x99\xaa"
878,00:35:53.40,00:35:53.40,"\xe2\x99\xaa Everybody sing ""Jaburu."" \xe2\x99\xaa"
879,00:35:56.20,00:35:56.20,We decided to go out into the water that's a little deeper.
880,00:35:58.83,00:35:58.83,"\xe2\x99\xaa O, glory \xe2\x99\xaa"
881,00:36:02.57,00:36:02.57,\xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah \xe2\x99\xaa
882,00:36:05.33,00:36:05.33,\xe2\x99\xaa Amen. \xe2\x99\xaa
883,00:36:09.07,00:36:09.07, Joanna got me  a little motivated for today
884,00:36:12.43,00:36:12.43, with a little gospel music.
885,00:36:13.60,00:36:13.60, She's just got this
886,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83,spirit about her that's--
887,00:36:16.93,00:36:16.93,"I think it's great, and I think everyone feels it."
888,00:36:18.83,00:36:18.83,(gasps) Here's one.
889,00:36:20.13,00:36:20.13,A little one?
890,00:36:21.30,00:36:21.30,-Yeah. -Grab his butt.
891,00:36:22.60,00:36:22.60,"JOANNA:  We did catch a little fish,"
892,00:36:24.50,00:36:24.50,and he was about this big.
893,00:36:27.47,00:36:27.47,And...
894,00:36:28.53,00:36:28.53, -we were proud.  -Want to see
895,00:36:29.73,00:36:29.73,how much protein we're going to get out of this?
896,00:36:31.60,00:36:31.60,You know what? Something's better than nothing.
897,00:36:33.60,00:36:33.60,You know what I'm saying?
898,00:36:35.10,00:36:35.10,"No one's going to gross out that we're eating this, right?"
899,00:36:37.63,00:36:37.63,"-No. -No, it's food."
900,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"I-- See, I can handle the bait way over the mush."
901,00:36:41.37,00:36:41.37,Let's make a little pancake.
902,00:36:42.43,00:36:42.43,HEIDI:  Jeanne and Joanna brought back
903,00:36:44.07,00:36:44.07,the miniature-sized fish.
904,00:36:45.57,00:36:45.57,Do you want to help with the fire?
905,00:36:47.07,00:36:47.07, I was pretty sure
906,00:36:48.33,00:36:48.33,"that after you gutted the thing, there would have been--"
907,00:36:50.80,00:36:50.80,there's just nothing even left.
908,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,"But we said, ""Hey, let's go for it."
909,00:36:55.00,00:36:55.00," We'll still try  to cook it somehow."""
910,00:36:57.07,00:36:57.07,"Well, what would we cook it in, that little tiny bit of fish?"
911,00:36:59.90,00:36:59.90,Did somebody find the oil? I think it's in that.
912,00:37:01.57,00:37:01.57,Yeah.
913,00:37:02.57,00:37:02.57,What kind of oil is this?
914,00:37:03.67,00:37:03.67,"-Do we know? -Baby oil, I think."
915,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,Just a little bit.
916,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,"HEIDI:  Jeanne had brought, uh--"
917,00:37:07.80,00:37:07.80," it's actually a massage oil,"
918,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,"but it's, like, an edible oil, which is even funnier."
919,00:37:12.60,00:37:12.60," We sliced up  this pint-size fish,"
920,00:37:15.90,00:37:15.90,and I seriously think I had about that much of it.
921,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,"Father, we thank you for this opportunity to come together"
922,00:37:22.87,00:37:22.87,like civilized women and eat like barbarian women.
923,00:37:26.03,00:37:26.03,We thank you. We ask you to let this be nourishing to our bodies
924,00:37:28.77,00:37:28.77,and help us to be successful in every attempt that we have
925,00:37:30.93,00:37:30.93,and every goal that we have.
926,00:37:33.77,00:37:33.77,(chuckles)
927,00:37:35.97,00:37:35.97,"I feel like I'm eating vomit right now,"
928,00:37:37.97,00:37:37.97,when it comes down to it.
929,00:37:39.33,00:37:39.33,Pretty good consistency going on.
930,00:37:41.60,00:37:41.60,"That or some snot, one of the two."
931,00:37:44.63,00:37:44.63,(laughs)
932,00:37:45.70,00:37:45.70,"Real good, though."
933,00:37:46.83,00:37:46.83,Thumbs up both ways.
934,00:37:48.20,00:37:48.20,(laughs)
935,00:38:07.20,00:38:07.20,First mail bomb.
936,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,You've got mail.
937,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,Thank God for mail.
938,00:38:12.47,00:38:12.47,"Checking the mail, kids."
939,00:38:15.00,00:38:15.00,"Here we go, first shot."
940,00:38:16.70,00:38:16.70,"-Hey, we got mail. -Oh, yeah."
941,00:38:18.53,00:38:18.53,ROGER:  We are the most macho guys
942,00:38:20.57,00:38:20.57,"that have ever been at Survivor, you know."
943,00:38:22.87,00:38:22.87,"Good-looking, macho."
944,00:38:24.33,00:38:24.33, We're confident we're going to
945,00:38:25.47,00:38:25.47, get through  the first challenge.
946,00:38:26.57,00:38:26.57, There's no doubt about that.
947,00:38:27.67,00:38:27.67,"If we lose to these women, man,"
948,00:38:30.27,00:38:30.27,we are going to get ragged on big-time.
949,00:38:32.23,00:38:32.23,"All right, let's go."
950,00:38:34.13,00:38:34.13,"""Working together from the start,"
951,00:38:36.17,00:38:36.17,"""As time goes by, you'll surely part,"
952,00:38:38.50,00:38:38.50,"""Use balance, agility and a bit of wit,"
953,00:38:40.63,00:38:40.63,"Be the one to fall short, and tonight could be it."""
954,00:38:43.63,00:38:43.63,Oh.
955,00:38:44.73,00:38:44.73,"Oh, it's going to be some sort of..."
956,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,"Oh, balance and agility."
957,00:38:47.17,00:38:47.17,Standing on... on a foot or...
958,00:38:55.87,00:38:55.87,"...two, three."
959,00:38:57.07,00:38:57.07,"WOMEN: Jaburu, Jaburu, Jaburu rocks!"
960,00:38:59.43,00:38:59.43,"Rules, rocks, rules, rules, rocks, rules."
961,00:39:01.43,00:39:01.43,"Everybody, get your shoes, water and..."
962,00:39:03.67,00:39:03.67,"DEENA:  In my heart of hearts,"
963,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00, I think that the women  are going to win
964,00:39:06.73,00:39:06.73,"a couple of immunity challenges, but overall,"
965,00:39:09.00,00:39:09.00,"I think that the men will probably dominate,"
966,00:39:10.90,00:39:10.90, just based on sheer strength  over the women.
967,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,The agility and wit thing I... I can handle.
968,00:39:16.37,00:39:16.37,"The balance thing, I'm, like, okay."
969,00:39:18.53,00:39:18.53,"Who's very good at balancing, you know?"
970,00:39:20.83,00:39:20.83,JENNA: I told Heidi  if it's a physical challenge
971,00:39:22.90,00:39:22.90,"and we can actually push them off things,"
972,00:39:24.47,00:39:24.47,that she needs to show them her boobs.
973,00:39:26.20,00:39:26.20, And then we can  distract them all and go.
974,00:39:35.87,00:39:35.87,"Head on in, guys."
975,00:39:39.63,00:39:39.63,"Welcome, guys, to your first immunity challenge."
976,00:39:44.07,00:39:44.07,"Before we get to that, I just want to check in."
977,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,"Been out here, uh, two nights now."
978,00:39:47.73,00:39:47.73,What's going on with you guys?
979,00:39:49.27,00:39:49.27,-Doing fantastic. -Yeah?
980,00:39:50.60,00:39:50.60,It's all-- it's good.
981,00:39:51.83,00:39:51.83,-Yeah? -It's all good in the neighborhood.
982,00:39:53.23,00:39:53.23,"-Yeah, we're having fun. -We're all full."
983,00:39:54.80,00:39:54.80,Been out trying to fish yet?
984,00:39:56.37,00:39:56.37,"-Oh, yeah. -Plenty of fish. We don't have to try."
985,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,Really?
986,00:39:59.00,00:39:59.00,-Yes. -Plenty of fish.
987,00:40:00.30,00:40:00.30,Catching a lot of fish?
988,00:40:01.33,00:40:01.33,Absolutely.
989,00:40:02.37,00:40:02.37,You buying that?
990,00:40:03.73,00:40:03.73,-(chuckling) -No. -No.
991,00:40:05.00,00:40:05.00,Are you kidding me?
992,00:40:06.00,00:40:06.00,It's terrible.
993,00:40:07.20,00:40:07.20,What's going on with you guys?
994,00:40:08.87,00:40:08.87,"-We got fish, and we ate them this morning. -Yeah."
995,00:40:10.87,00:40:10.87,-(chuckling) -We did. -Yeah.
996,00:40:12.23,00:40:12.23,For real.
997,00:40:13.40,00:40:13.40,"Guys, you buying that?"
998,00:40:14.57,00:40:14.57,"-No. -No way. -Not at all, no way."
999,00:40:16.07,00:40:16.07,I tasted that grain; it's not that good.
1000,00:40:17.83,00:40:17.83,-No. -Just look at them. Look how skinny they are.
1001,00:40:19.63,00:40:19.63,"All right, let's get to today's challenge."
1002,00:40:22.23,00:40:22.23,It is for immunity.
1003,00:40:24.10,00:40:24.10,"More than anything else,"
1004,00:40:25.53,00:40:25.53,you will covet immunity.
1005,00:40:29.80,00:40:29.80,This is what you're playing for.
1006,00:40:31.20,00:40:31.20,This is the immunity idol.
1007,00:40:32.47,00:40:32.47,(cheering)
1008,00:40:33.97,00:40:33.97,Everybody get a feel of that.
1009,00:40:40.47,00:40:40.47,"-Joanna, did you get that? -Mm-hmm."

1037,00:41:36.73,00:41:36.73,This will break you into pairs.
1038,00:41:38.07,00:41:38.07, You now have
1039,00:41:39.07,00:41:39.07,four groups of two.
1040,00:41:40.23,00:41:40.23, Make your way  along the balance beam.

1043,00:41:46.27,00:41:46.27, another set of keys  will separate you
1044,00:41:48.17,00:41:48.17,into eight individuals.
1045,00:41:49.77,00:41:49.77," Then you'll come to a puzzle,  which two of you must complete"
1046,00:41:51.83,00:41:51.83, to get one more key.
1047,00:41:54.47,00:41:54.47,"One person takes this key,"
1048,00:41:56.43,00:41:56.43," races up the ladder,  unlocks the flying fox,"
1049,00:41:59.57,00:41:59.57, zips down the line  and grabs the last key.
1050,00:42:03.10,00:42:03.10,You'll then race back and release the rest of
1051,00:42:04.97,00:42:04.97,"your tribe members, who are waiting behind a gate."

1211,00:47:28.00,00:47:28.00,"If that don't remind you, just do what you can do."
1212,00:47:30.30,00:47:30.30,"Do your thing, guys. You're doing great."
1213,00:47:31.53,00:47:31.53,PROBST: Jaburu very close.
1214,00:47:36.07,00:47:36.07,"-Yeah, baby! -Come on, come on, come on!"

1224,00:47:58.20,00:47:58.20,"Go, go, go!"
1225,00:48:00.40,00:48:00.40,Get up here to the gate!
1226,00:48:02.80,00:48:02.80,Up to the gate!

1228,00:48:09.73,00:48:09.73,Key in front of you.

1241,00:48:55.80,00:48:55.80,"Ladies, you're safe for three more days."
1242,00:48:59.37,00:48:59.37,Nobody going home yet.
1243,00:49:00.73,00:49:00.73,Congratulations.
1244,00:49:01.73,00:49:01.73,(cheering)
1245,00:49:03.37,00:49:03.37,"Tambaqui, you had a big lead."
1246,00:49:05.63,00:49:05.63,You just blew it.
1247,00:49:06.77,00:49:06.77,"Despite your predictions, you guys are"
1248,00:49:08.73,00:49:08.73,going to Tribal Council tonight.
1249,00:49:09.83,00:49:09.83,Somebody will have the distinction of
1250,00:49:11.83,00:49:11.83,being the first person voted out.
1251,00:49:13.00,00:49:13.00,You guys can head back to camp.
1252,00:49:28.00,00:49:28.00,\xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah! \xe2\x99\xaa
1253,00:49:44.27,00:49:44.27,DEENA: They sure got a shock.
1254,00:49:47.10,00:49:47.10,JOANNA: They did get a shock.
1255,00:49:48.27,00:49:48.27,They've been talking smack on us since we separated teams.
1256,00:49:50.53,00:49:50.53,"HEIDI: We were definitely  behind in the challenge, and"
1257,00:49:55.47,00:49:55.47,we came back with flying colors pretty much.
1258,00:49:58.53,00:49:58.53,"We just really, really kicked some butt today."
1259,00:50:00.77,00:50:00.77,-And she's twisting... -And they were absolutely loving it.
1260,00:50:03.30,00:50:03.30, And Janet has started  to feel a lot better now.
1261,00:50:06.73,00:50:06.73,"DEENA: Shawna, man, set the pace, though,"
1262,00:50:07.87,00:50:07.87,in the beginning of that commando fall thing.
1263,00:50:09.10,00:50:09.10,She whipped us through that. It was great.
1264,00:50:10.77,00:50:10.77,"I said, I said, ""They're listening"
1265,00:50:12.10,00:50:12.10,"to everything you guys are saying."""
1266,00:50:13.47,00:50:13.47,They were just like parrots.
1267,00:50:15.13,00:50:15.13,"We're like, ""Put the trees up."""
1268,00:50:16.50,00:50:16.50,"They're like, ""Put the trees up."""
1269,00:50:17.90,00:50:17.90,(laughter)
1270,00:50:19.47,00:50:19.47,"""Do the letters first."""
1271,00:50:21.23,00:50:21.23,"I'm like, ""Wait a second."
1272,00:50:22.63,00:50:22.63,"Is there an echo in the jungle?"""
1273,00:50:25.07,00:50:25.07,"HEIDI: I mean, it just mentally  gives you more energy."
1274,00:50:27.10,00:50:27.10," Like, hey,  we really can do this."
1275,00:50:28.93,00:50:28.93,We can pull this off just as well as they can.
1276,00:50:31.97,00:50:31.97,Actually better.
1277,00:50:41.90,00:50:41.90,BUTCH: We just returned  from our first challenge.
1278,00:50:44.43,00:50:44.43,I think we went into it maybe a little cocky.
1279,00:50:46.87,00:50:46.87,"In other words,"
1280,00:50:47.87,00:50:47.87,there's no way that eight girls
1281,00:50:50.33,00:50:50.33, are going to beat  eight macho guys.
1282,00:50:52.30,00:50:52.30,You think those chicks really caught fish?
1283,00:50:55.30,00:50:55.30,"Today, I think you had eight guys"
1284,00:50:56.73,00:50:56.73,believing in themselves a little too much.
1285,00:51:01.70,00:51:01.70,ROB: I give the girls  a ton of credit.
1286,00:51:03.83,00:51:03.83,This is Billie Jean King versus Bobby Riggs
1287,00:51:07.03,00:51:07.03,for a new millennium.
1288,00:51:08.37,00:51:08.37, I know what's riding on this.
1289,00:51:10.97,00:51:10.97,"All right, fellas, I want 30 seconds of your silence, please."
1290,00:51:14.03,00:51:14.03,I want to say this one because it's been pissing me off.
1291,00:51:17.33,00:51:17.33,We performed like a bunch of cocky ass ...
1292,00:51:20.20,00:51:20.20,I think we were baited
1293,00:51:21.93,00:51:21.93,with the question of how many fish have you caught
1294,00:51:25.30,00:51:25.30,after the chicks were already asked that question.
1295,00:51:29.07,00:51:29.07,"And I think we answered with a cocky, arrogant answer."
1296,00:51:33.77,00:51:33.77,Don't bring me down with your bull ...
1297,00:51:36.63,00:51:36.63,"I got character, and I got integrity."
1298,00:51:39.70,00:51:39.70,"And I don't care if they're-they're girls,"
1299,00:51:41.70,00:51:41.70,"if they're guys, but don't lie to them"
1300,00:51:44.13,00:51:44.13,"about how good we're doing,"
1301,00:51:45.83,00:51:45.83,"'cause we're doing, we're doing great."
1302,00:51:47.97,00:51:47.97,But don't lie to 'em.
1303,00:51:49.77,00:51:49.77,"DANIEL: Dave, he was  upset about, you know,"
1304,00:51:51.50,00:51:51.50,"us joking around, saying that we caught fish."
1305,00:51:54.07,00:51:54.07,It's not a big deal.
1306,00:51:55.20,00:51:55.20,He needs to lighten up.
1307,00:51:56.47,00:51:56.47,"I mean, he's way too serious about this."
1308,00:51:58.13,00:51:58.13,"I mean, who does he think he is"
1309,00:51:59.83,00:51:59.83, to stand up on a soapbox  and lecture us about that?
1310,00:52:02.67,00:52:02.67,"If they ask, ""Have you caught any fish?"""
1311,00:52:04.50,00:52:04.50,"we don't say, ""Many, many, many fish."""
1312,00:52:07.23,00:52:07.23,"We say, ""No, we haven't found anything."""
1313,00:52:09.63,00:52:09.63,ROB:  Dave is a stand-up guy.
1314,00:52:11.57,00:52:11.57," He has a lot of integrity and,  uh, is a really honest guy,"
1315,00:52:16.43,00:52:16.43,"which is really great for me,"
1316,00:52:18.50,00:52:18.50,because I'm going to lie and cheat
1317,00:52:20.57,00:52:20.57,and do whatever it takes to win.
1318,00:52:21.67,00:52:21.67,"And if he's only going to tell the truth all the time,"
1319,00:52:24.03,00:52:24.03,that's going to hurt him in this game.
1320,00:52:25.37,00:52:25.37,"I just want to, uh, say, absolutely, Dave."
1321,00:52:29.93,00:52:29.93,"Dude, I-I... I'm in total agreement."
1322,00:52:32.00,00:52:32.00,It's... It doesn't make any sense.
1323,00:52:34.00,00:52:34.00,Just doesn't make any sense.
1324,00:52:35.30,00:52:35.30,-10-4. -Yeah. -Yep.
1325,00:52:36.80,00:52:36.80,"I just want to say one thing. Just, the balance beam--"
1326,00:52:39.27,00:52:39.27,"we just had to keep going over and over again,"
1327,00:52:41.03,00:52:41.03,"over and over again. I mean, people kept falling"
1328,00:52:42.70,00:52:42.70,"and falling and falling, and we got too behind."
1329,00:52:44.87,00:52:44.87,"But if I, if I made the mistake,"
1330,00:52:46.20,00:52:46.20,"guys, I'm sorry. You know what I mean?"
1331,00:52:48.33,00:52:48.33,"RYAN: I saw the course,  and I was like,"
1332,00:52:50.97,00:52:50.97,"""We got this in the bag."""
1333,00:52:52.80,00:52:52.80,"And the most athletic, biggest guy would turn out to be"
1334,00:52:55.83,00:52:55.83,"just a meathead, you know?"
1335,00:52:57.33,00:52:57.33, It was Dan's fault.
1336,00:52:58.40,00:52:58.40," He fell off the log  four times, and..."
1337,00:53:00.67,00:53:00.67,now I'm the one with my ass on the stove.
1338,00:53:03.03,00:53:03.03,"I'm thinking, by the way..."
1339,00:53:05.80,00:53:05.80,What way?
1340,00:53:07.10,00:53:07.10,"Our boy, uh... our boy Ryan is the first one out of here."
1341,00:53:12.20,00:53:12.20,That's fine by me. Um...
1342,00:53:14.00,00:53:14.00,All right. All right.
1343,00:53:15.60,00:53:15.60,We don't need to talk about it.
1344,00:53:17.33,00:53:17.33,-Fine. -All right?
1345,00:53:18.63,00:53:18.63,Done.
1346,00:53:19.63,00:53:19.63,I will not vote Ryan off.
1347,00:53:21.97,00:53:21.97,"Um, we're from the same hometown."
1348,00:53:24.37,00:53:24.37,I feel we have some connection.
1349,00:53:25.73,00:53:25.73," But somebody, uh, like Daniel,"
1350,00:53:28.20,00:53:28.20," who's not really  volunteering to help out,"
1351,00:53:30.90,00:53:30.90, not volunteering  to get involved...
1352,00:53:34.27,00:53:34.27,He's not really doing it for me right now.
1353,00:53:36.67,00:53:36.67,"Yo, I'm just scared because, uh, Dave seems like"
1354,00:53:39.37,00:53:39.37,he's getting really close to Roger.
1355,00:53:40.50,00:53:40.50,Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.
1356,00:53:42.30,00:53:42.30,"I mean, I-I really like our tribe."
1357,00:53:43.80,00:53:43.80,"I think everybody's pretty cool, man,"
1358,00:53:45.17,00:53:45.17,but I don't feel like kissing Roger's ass.
1359,00:53:47.37,00:53:47.37,"I mean, I've been doing it. I mean, seriously, I mean..."
1360,00:53:49.27,00:53:49.27,"-Yeah, me, too. -""Go cut wood."
1361,00:53:50.80,00:53:50.80,"Cut this. Do that."" And that's fine. I mean, cool."
1362,00:53:52.40,00:53:52.40,I don't mind. I'm not complaining.
1363,00:53:53.50,00:53:53.50,"I'm just saying, but..."
1364,00:53:54.67,00:53:54.67,MATTHEW:  There's a lot of tension now.
1365,00:53:55.93,00:53:55.93, Everyone seems to be  jockeying for position.
1366,00:53:57.63,00:53:57.63,There's a lot of friction between Ryan and Roger.
1367,00:54:01.47,00:54:01.47, I think that the friction  has built up over the last
1368,00:54:04.70,00:54:04.70," couple of days, and"
1369,00:54:06.60,00:54:06.60,it's culminated in kind of a face-off.
1370,00:54:08.67,00:54:08.67,We have to go for the big time now.
1371,00:54:10.80,00:54:10.80,We go for Roger tonight.
1372,00:54:11.97,00:54:11.97,-That's three votes. -Uh-huh.
1373,00:54:13.60,00:54:13.60,We don't talk anymore tonight. We don't look at
1374,00:54:15.47,00:54:15.47,each other tonight. Stay the ... away from each other.
1375,00:54:17.30,00:54:17.30,"We do this, and we go down."
1376,00:54:19.03,00:54:19.03,"-Hands in, we all made a pact. -Okay, that's cool."
1377,00:54:21.03,00:54:21.03,"-I'm with you, man. -So what's the name?"
1378,00:54:22.60,00:54:22.60,-Say it one more time. -Roger.
1379,00:54:23.83,00:54:23.83,Done.
1380,00:54:24.83,00:54:24.83,"RYAN: Right now, what I got to  do is I got to go after Roger"
1381,00:54:28.03,00:54:28.03, and break  that whole coalition up.
1382,00:54:29.77,00:54:29.77,"I just feel that they're going to try to go for me,"
1383,00:54:31.70,00:54:31.70,so I got to go for him; I have no choice.
1384,00:54:35.97,00:54:35.97,"They're gonna pick us off one by one, I'm letting you know."
1385,00:54:38.20,00:54:38.20,"So I'm saying right now, I guarantee you"
1386,00:54:39.60,00:54:39.60,we can have four votes now.
1387,00:54:40.87,00:54:40.87,"They might go for Daniel, or they might go for me,"
1388,00:54:42.57,00:54:42.57,-and we can still win. -ROB: Ryan is
1389,00:54:44.40,00:54:44.40,"fun, but he's also loud, uh,"
1390,00:54:48.23,00:54:48.23,abrasive at times and extremely self-centered.
1391,00:54:51.10,00:54:51.10,"If you say you don't want to know, it's fine,"
1392,00:54:52.63,00:54:52.63,"but just I'm asking you-- if we're good, we're good."
1393,00:54:54.47,00:54:54.47,I'm not gonna...
1394,00:54:55.47,00:54:55.47,"'Kay, we're good."
1395,00:54:57.67,00:54:57.67,"No more talking, to anybody."
1396,00:54:59.40,00:54:59.40,"Don't look at anybody else, just say tonight: ""Roger."""
1397,00:55:01.90,00:55:01.90,"-Yeah. Game, set, match. -All right, man."
1398,00:55:03.43,00:55:03.43,Done.
1399,00:55:05.43,00:55:05.43,ROB: You really have to  operate as a team
1400,00:55:07.37,00:55:07.37,and look out for other people's  interests at times.
1401,00:55:09.70,00:55:09.70, The guy is focused  only on himself.
1402,00:55:11.87,00:55:11.87,"Roger, on-- for his part, though, is extremely bossy"
1403,00:55:15.30,00:55:15.30,"and is telling everybody, everybody what to do."
1404,00:55:17.63,00:55:17.63,Real quickly.
1405,00:55:20.10,00:55:20.10,"Alex, Matthew..."
1406,00:55:23.47,00:55:23.47,uh... David and myself.
1407,00:55:27.10,00:55:27.10,"Clearly, uh, those two kids are gone."
1408,00:55:29.37,00:55:29.37,"As long as we're in agreement,"
1409,00:55:30.73,00:55:30.73,that's what's the important thing.
1410,00:55:31.80,00:55:31.80,"Yeah, we are."
1411,00:55:32.87,00:55:32.87,"ROB:  Privately, Ryan has asked me"
1412,00:55:34.90,00:55:34.90," to vote with him  to get rid of Roger,"
1413,00:55:37.27,00:55:37.27,and Roger has asked me to vote with him to get rid of Ryan.
1414,00:55:42.00,00:55:42.00,And I've told them both that I will do what they want.
1415,00:55:44.87,00:55:44.87,Ready to party on?
1416,00:55:46.07,00:55:46.07,-Yep. -Ready.
1417,00:55:47.20,00:55:47.20,"-Let's go, guys. -ROB: It's Roger"
1418,00:55:48.70,00:55:48.70, versus Ryan.
1419,00:55:50.30,00:55:50.30, I'm just going to see  which way it clears out.
1420,00:55:51.90,00:55:51.90," I mean, both guys have  their pluses and minuses."
1421,00:56:19.93,00:56:19.93,Behind each of you guys is a torch in your tribe color.
1422,00:56:24.00,00:56:24.00,"Grab a torch, approach the flame,"
1423,00:56:26.10,00:56:26.10,dip it and get fire.
1424,00:56:31.33,00:56:31.33,This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council
1425,00:56:33.63,00:56:33.63,because fire most definitely represents
1426,00:56:35.83,00:56:35.83,your life in this game.
1427,00:56:37.53,00:56:37.53,"As long as you have fire, you're still alive."
1428,00:56:39.23,00:56:39.23,"When your fire's done, so are you."
1429,00:56:42.53,00:56:42.53,Take a seat.
1430,00:56:47.70,00:56:47.70,Tribal Council is where you are
1431,00:56:50.63,00:56:50.63,held accountable for your action.
1432,00:56:52.33,00:56:52.33,"Tonight, somebody will be"
1433,00:56:54.13,00:56:54.13,the first person voted out of the Amazon.
1434,00:56:55.93,00:56:55.93,"But before we get to that, let's have a little chat."
1435,00:56:59.03,00:56:59.03,I'm guessing this has to be
1436,00:57:00.83,00:57:00.83,really humbling for you guys right now.
1437,00:57:03.67,00:57:03.67,"-Say that again. -Or am I wrong, Roger?"
1438,00:57:05.20,00:57:05.20,"Is it just one challenge, you know,"
1439,00:57:06.57,00:57:06.57,"and, hey, what's the big deal?"
1440,00:57:08.03,00:57:08.03,"It's-It's humbling, but, uh, you know, we did our best."
1441,00:57:10.93,00:57:10.93,And the interesting thing was
1442,00:57:12.37,00:57:12.37,we thought we were going to get on the--
1443,00:57:13.93,00:57:13.93,"get beat on the mental side,"
1444,00:57:15.60,00:57:15.60,and they actually beat us on the physical side.
1445,00:57:17.47,00:57:17.47,And that was a shock.
1446,00:57:18.70,00:57:18.70,"No, they beat you all the way around."
1447,00:57:20.00,00:57:20.00,Okay. (chuckles)
1448,00:57:22.17,00:57:22.17,"-Well? -Well, they did. They--"
1449,00:57:23.67,00:57:23.67,"Hey, they won fair and square."
1450,00:57:24.83,00:57:24.83,"And, you know, what can you say?"
1451,00:57:27.73,00:57:27.73,"Well, there were a lot of comments made,"
1452,00:57:30.37,00:57:30.37,"specifically by you, Daniel, on the boat--"
1453,00:57:32.53,00:57:32.53,"""We will not lose one challenge."""
1454,00:57:34.97,00:57:34.97,"Well, you know, that's what happens when you get"
1455,00:57:36.87,00:57:36.87,"a little cocky, you know, you get humbled."
1456,00:57:39.47,00:57:39.47,"Hey, it was a mistake."
1457,00:57:40.90,00:57:40.90,"I think all-all of our guys, we did really well."
1458,00:57:44.03,00:57:44.03,"I mean, we had it, but I blew it."
1459,00:57:46.53,00:57:46.53,"I mean, it's my fault."
1460,00:57:47.80,00:57:47.80,I'm the reason why we're here.
1461,00:57:49.30,00:57:49.30,-Really? -Mm-hmm.
1462,00:57:50.77,00:57:50.77,"But you're-you're tied next to your partner here, Ryan,"
1463,00:57:53.40,00:57:53.40,who didn't seem to be doing a lot better.
1464,00:57:55.70,00:57:55.70,"Well, hey, you know,"
1465,00:57:57.10,00:57:57.10,"the girls-- they might have won the battle,"
1466,00:57:58.73,00:57:58.73,but they haven't won the war.
1467,00:58:00.30,00:58:00.30,"Alex, how tough is it to be"
1468,00:58:03.20,00:58:03.20,so overconfident and lose?
1469,00:58:06.07,00:58:06.07,I think initially we were pretty over--
1470,00:58:08.17,00:58:08.17,we were pretty confident.
1471,00:58:09.50,00:58:09.50,"We were like, yeah, gung ho guys."
1472,00:58:11.70,00:58:11.70,Women are not going to just roll over.
1473,00:58:13.50,00:58:13.50,They're going to want to compete even harder
1474,00:58:15.57,00:58:15.57,because it's women against men.
1475,00:58:17.23,00:58:17.23,And today is proof of it.
1476,00:58:19.30,00:58:19.30,We worked really hard.
1477,00:58:21.00,00:58:21.00,We got beat.
1478,00:58:22.00,00:58:22.00,We had a bad day.
1479,00:58:23.27,00:58:23.27,That's all it comes down to.
1480,00:58:25.00,00:58:25.00,You had a few minutes to see the women.
1481,00:58:27.30,00:58:27.30,I know you talked about them.
1482,00:58:28.90,00:58:28.90,Anybody stand out?
1483,00:58:30.50,00:58:30.50,I think every one of those girls has a unique quality...
1484,00:58:33.17,00:58:33.17,-(laughter) -Uh...
1485,00:58:34.67,00:58:34.67,"...and, uh, some have more unique qualities than others."
1486,00:58:37.27,00:58:37.27,Some are physically unique.
1487,00:58:39.47,00:58:39.47,"But when it's all said and done, uh, none of those girls are"
1488,00:58:42.97,00:58:42.97,"worth a million dollars, and that's where I stand."
1489,00:58:45.33,00:58:45.33,"How about you, Daniel?"
1490,00:58:46.83,00:58:46.83,I'll just go out and say I think Shawna is pretty damn hot.
1491,00:58:49.67,00:58:49.67,"Uh, she's very athletic."
1492,00:58:51.30,00:58:51.30,She's got a great body.
1493,00:58:52.67,00:58:52.67,"But I don't know. Right now,"
1494,00:58:54.23,00:58:54.23,"after not showering for three days,"
1495,00:58:55.90,00:58:55.90,"I don't know how attracted I would be to her, but..."
1496,00:58:57.93,00:58:57.93,(chuckles)
1497,00:58:58.93,00:58:58.93,But you're putting it out there.
1498,00:59:00.37,00:59:00.37,-Yeah. -Dave.
1499,00:59:01.93,00:59:01.93,"Follow suit, Shawna wore a, uh, ski hat; that's badass."
1500,00:59:05.30,00:59:05.30,I think Ryan was-was trying to say it.
1501,00:59:07.50,00:59:07.50,Make an analogy-- the quarterback doesn't
1502,00:59:09.87,00:59:09.87,screw the cheerleaders at halftime.
1503,00:59:11.43,00:59:11.43,"You know, we're here to play the game."
1504,00:59:13.43,00:59:13.43,Wow.
1505,00:59:14.80,00:59:14.80,You should be living with these guys.
1506,00:59:16.27,00:59:16.27,(laughter)
1507,00:59:17.27,00:59:17.27,Alex.
1508,00:59:19.13,00:59:19.13,I'm going to be the third one to vote for Shawna here.
1509,00:59:21.20,00:59:21.20,She's-She's a hottie.
1510,00:59:22.20,00:59:22.20,-Bangarang. -Yeah.
1511,00:59:23.63,00:59:23.63,"Yeah, absolutely."
1512,00:59:25.03,00:59:25.03,"I just wanted to, uh, add to my vote that I also think"
1513,00:59:28.10,00:59:28.10,"that Shawna is hot, but I think that Heidi is the hottest."
1514,00:59:31.60,00:59:31.60,"You know what's great about th-- Oh, Ryan, yes?"
1515,00:59:34.37,00:59:34.37,(scattered chuckles)
1516,00:59:36.73,00:59:36.73,He loves that girl.
1517,00:59:38.60,00:59:38.60,"I mean, he-he really, really likes..."
1518,00:59:40.40,00:59:40.40,"Now, ""love"" is a strong word,"
1519,00:59:41.83,00:59:41.83,being that I've never spoken to her.
1520,00:59:43.23,00:59:43.23,PROBST: You know what's great?
1521,00:59:44.57,00:59:44.57,You came out from day one talking more trash
1522,00:59:47.47,00:59:47.47,"than I've ever heard, ever."
1523,00:59:49.60,00:59:49.60,You got your asses kicked.
1524,00:59:51.47,00:59:51.47,"And yet, when we get to women, it's like, ""Ah, who cares?"
1525,00:59:53.63,00:59:53.63,"I want to hook up."""
1526,00:59:55.10,00:59:55.10,That's why you guys could be really in serious trouble.
1527,01:00:01.17,01:00:01.17,All right.
1528,01:00:03.33,01:00:03.33,It is time to vote.
1529,01:00:05.13,01:00:05.13,"Roger, you're first."
1530,01:00:22.67,01:00:22.67,"He gives me so much advice, it really irritates me."
1531,01:00:40.17,01:00:40.17,"My advice to you is, uh,"
1532,01:00:41.30,01:00:41.30,don't hunt what you can't kill.
1533,01:00:58.70,01:00:58.70,"Ryan, I think you're a pretty good boy."
1534,01:01:01.17,01:01:01.17,The only problem is that you're still a boy.
1535,01:01:03.10,01:01:03.10,Sometimes silence is golden.
1536,01:01:16.80,01:01:16.80,I didn't like your attitude at
1537,01:01:18.37,01:01:18.37,"the immunity challenge today,"
1538,01:01:19.97,01:01:19.97,and I didn't like the way
1539,01:01:21.40,01:01:21.40,it reflected upon the team.
1540,01:01:35.63,01:01:35.63,I'll go tally the votes.
1541,01:01:43.63,01:01:43.63,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
1542,01:01:46.07,01:01:46.07,The person voted out will be asked to leave
1543,01:01:48.17,01:01:48.17,the Tribal Council area immediately.
1544,01:01:50.10,01:01:50.10,I'll read the votes.
1545,01:01:54.23,01:01:54.23,First vote...
1546,01:01:56.97,01:01:56.97,Ryan.
1547,01:02:04.00,01:02:04.00,Roger.
1548,01:02:07.97,01:02:07.97,Dan.
1549,01:02:09.53,01:02:09.53,"One vote Dan, one vote Ryan, one vote Roger."
1550,01:02:18.80,01:02:18.80,Ryan.
1551,01:02:23.40,01:02:23.40,Roger.
1552,01:02:26.37,01:02:26.37,"One vote Dan, two votes Ryan, two votes Roger."
1553,01:02:33.80,01:02:33.80,Ryan.
1554,01:02:41.10,01:02:41.10,Roger.
1555,01:02:42.73,01:02:42.73,"We're tied: three votes Ryan, three votes Roger."
1556,01:02:47.90,01:02:47.90,First person voted out of the tribe...
1557,01:02:53.37,01:02:53.37,Ryan. Need to bring me your torch.
1558,01:03:07.53,01:03:07.53,"Ryan, the tribe has spoken."
1559,01:03:13.33,01:03:13.33,"It's time for you to go, man."
1560,01:03:26.43,01:03:26.43,"Came into the game a little confident,"
1561,01:03:28.47,01:03:28.47,maybe a little arrogant.
1562,01:03:29.67,01:03:29.67,But what should be more concerning is this is
1563,01:03:32.20,01:03:32.20,"clearly a tribe divided, based on tonight's vote."
1564,01:03:35.37,01:03:35.37,Might be something worth looking at.
1565,01:03:37.17,01:03:37.17,36 more days.
1566,01:03:38.70,01:03:38.70,Guys can head back to camp.
1567,01:03:40.00,01:03:40.00,Good night.
1568,01:03:56.90,01:03:56.90,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
1569,01:04:03.67,01:04:03.67,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
1570,01:04:04.97,01:04:04.97," An Amazon storm  hits both tribes,"
1571,01:04:07.23,01:04:07.23, leaving the men dry...
1572,01:04:09.07,01:04:09.07,Suck to be outside right now.
1573,01:04:10.73,01:04:10.73, ...and the women drenched.
1574,01:04:11.97,01:04:11.97,Forgot that we're in the middle of the Amazon
1575,01:04:13.70,01:04:13.70,and that torrential rainstorms come by daily.
1576,01:04:15.70,01:04:15.70, And a shocking discovery
1577,01:04:17.17,01:04:17.17, threatens to split  the Jaburu tribe.
1578,01:04:19.57,01:04:19.57,There's something in there that shouldn't be in there.
1579,01:04:21.33,01:04:21.33,Somebody just needs to fess up.
1580,01:04:28.33,01:04:28.33,"Well, guys, here we are."
1581,01:04:29.97,01:04:29.97,"I guess when I knew I did Survivor,"
1582,01:04:31.60,01:04:31.60,I knew I was in for the biggest challenge of my life.
1583,01:04:33.60,01:04:33.60," And, uh, I definitely  got what I came in for,"
1584,01:04:35.90,01:04:35.90, and I definitely  got what I expected.
1585,01:04:37.33,01:04:37.33," Um, I learned a lot, though."
1586,01:04:38.73,01:04:38.73," I learned how to make shelter,  and more importantly,"
1587,01:04:40.60,01:04:40.60," I learned a lot about myself  and, uh, how I perceive others"
1588,01:04:43.20,01:04:43.20, and how they perceive me.
1589,01:04:44.73,01:04:44.73,"You know, I thought I'd be mad,  but for the first time,"
1590,01:04:46.83,01:04:46.83," I just, I really put things  in perspective."
1591,01:04:48.57,01:04:48.57, And it was a great journey.
1592,01:04:50.33,01:04:50.33, I had a lot of fun.
1593,01:04:51.60,01:04:51.60, I wish you guys all the best.
1594,01:04:53.20,01:04:53.20," So good luck to the winner,"
1595,01:04:54.47,01:04:54.47,"and, uh, we'll see you around soon."
1596,01:04:56.87,01:04:56.87,"And, uh, God bless."
