527,00:15:27.27,00:15:27.27,I THINK I CAN TRUST THEM.
528,00:15:28.33,00:15:28.33,I WANT TO GET TO KNOW THEM
529,00:15:29.90,00:15:29.90,BETTER AND SEE WHERE THEIR HEADS
530,00:15:31.20,00:15:31.20,ARE AT.

532,00:15:32.97,00:15:32.97,CHELSEA'S GREAT.
533,00:15:34.57,00:15:34.57,SHE HASN'T BEEN PLAYING
534,00:15:35.70,00:15:35.70,STRATEGY.
535,00:15:36.10,00:15:36.10,SHE'S JUST KIND OF... SHE'S

542,00:15:47.37,00:15:47.37,INTO IT.
543,00:15:47.87,00:15:47.87,AND WHEN IT COMES TIME TO
544,00:15:49.23,00:15:49.23,VOTE WE HAVE TO TELL EACH OTHER
545,00:15:50.53,00:15:50.53,WHAT'S GOING DOWN AND MAKE SURE
546,00:15:51.87,00:15:51.87,THAT IT GOES NOT TOWARDS ANY ONE
547,00:15:53.93,00:15:53.93,OF US AND PRETTY SOON WE'RE IN
548,00:15:56.03,00:15:56.03,THE MAJORITY AND IT DOESN'T

556,00:16:05.70,00:16:05.70,AND IF WE GET TO THE MERGE AND
557,00:16:07.30,00:16:07.30,"DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS, TROY AND"
558,00:16:08.73,00:16:08.73,JAY ARE MY ALLIANCE ALL THE WAY.
559,00:16:10.20,00:16:10.20,I CAN'T GET OVER HOW THIS COULD

566,00:16:18.07,00:16:18.07,I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
567,00:16:19.20,00:16:19.20,HARD AND A GRIND AND I KNOW IT
568,00:16:20.53,00:16:20.53,WILL HAVE ITS MOMENTS BUT THIS

570,00:16:22.87,00:16:22.87,THIS IS A GOOD TIME.
571,00:16:23.87,00:16:23.87,I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB.
572,00:16:26.87,00:16:26.87,I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO TRUST
573,00:16:28.67,00:16:28.67,PEOPLE THAT I DON'T TRUST.
574,00:16:29.53,00:16:29.53,"WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO"
575,00:16:31.30,00:16:31.30,TRY TO TRUST THEM.

577,00:16:34.03,00:16:34.03,YOU DON'T TRUST CHRISTINA?
578,00:16:35.97,00:16:35.97,NO.
579,00:16:36.57,00:16:36.57,NOT AT ALL.
580,00:16:37.93,00:16:37.93,"I DON'T, EITHER."
581,00:16:39.70,00:16:39.70,I'M ALMOST THINKING-- DON'T

583,00:16:43.20,00:16:43.20,"ABOUT THIS, YOU SWEAR?"
584,00:16:44.20,00:16:44.20,SWEAR.
585,00:16:44.77,00:16:44.77,WE NEED TO GET OUT CHRISTINA
586,00:16:49.60,00:16:49.60,FIRST.
587,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,"WE NEED FOUR, THOUGH."

592,00:16:59.87,00:16:59.87,NO.
593,00:17:00.93,00:17:00.93,THAT'S UNSTABLE.
594,00:17:01.73,00:17:01.73,UH-UH.
595,00:17:02.17,00:17:02.17,THAT'S WHY YOU GUYS HAD ALL THAT
596,00:17:03.83,00:17:03.83,CRAZY STUFF GOING DOWN.
597,00:17:05.70,00:17:05.70,LEAVE IT AS IT IS.
598,00:17:06.83,00:17:06.83,THE GIRLS ARE LOYAL.
599,00:17:08.00,00:17:08.00,YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE
600,00:17:09.97,00:17:09.97,CRAZY.
601,00:17:10.40,00:17:10.40,I DON'T CONSIDER COLTON AS A GUY
602,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE FOUR
603,00:17:13.43,00:17:13.43,WOMEN AGAINST THREE GUYS.
604,00:17:14.73,00:17:14.73,BUT COLTON'S CRAZY.
605,00:17:16.57,00:17:16.57,HE REALLY WANTS CHRISTINA OUT
606,00:17:18.43,00:17:18.43,BUT I NEED TO KEEP MY WOMEN HERE
607,00:17:20.90,00:17:20.90,AND GET RID OF THE GUYS SO THAT

611,00:17:37.47,00:17:37.47,SO WHAT'S THE STORY BETWEEN
612,00:17:38.87,00:17:38.87,YOU AND ALICIA.
613,00:17:40.23,00:17:40.23,I'M JUST TALKING TO HER.
614,00:17:41.87,00:17:41.87,YOU'RE IN GOOD WITH HER.
615,00:17:43.23,00:17:43.23,WHAT'S THE PLAN?
616,00:17:43.90,00:17:43.90,"I'M STICKING WITH THE GUYS,"
617,00:17:46.10,00:17:46.10,HONESTLY.
618,00:17:46.53,00:17:46.53,I CAN'T AFFORD TO GO WITH THESE
619,00:17:47.67,00:17:47.67,WOMEN.
620,00:17:47.80,00:17:47.80,WHILE WE'RE WORKING BUSTING
621,00:17:49.40,00:17:49.40,"OUR ASS BUILDING A SHELTER,"
622,00:17:51.07,00:17:51.07,COLTON IS DOING THE SAME THING!
623,00:17:52.60,00:17:52.60,HE'S JUST SITTING ON HIS ASS
624,00:17:54.87,00:17:54.87,TALKING TO ALICIA.
625,00:17:56.57,00:17:56.57,I'M LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON?
626,00:17:59.43,00:17:59.43,HOW... HOW DOES HE GET AWAY WITH
627,00:18:01.47,00:18:01.47,THIS?
628,00:18:01.93,00:18:01.93,I... IT JUST... IT'S... I NEVER
629,00:18:04.00,00:18:04.00,THOUGHT TO PLAY THAT GAME.
630,00:18:09.37,00:18:09.37,IT'S BRILLIANT.
631,00:18:09.77,00:18:09.77,THEY HAVE TO THINK I'M THEIR
632,00:18:11.30,00:18:11.30,FOURTH.
633,00:18:11.50,00:18:11.50,BUT I'M NOT.
634,00:18:12.30,00:18:12.30,YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.
635,00:18:13.00,00:18:13.00,DON'T SCAM ME BRO.
636,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,"FIST BUMP, I'M NOT."
637,00:18:16.40,00:18:16.40,SERIOUSLY.
638,00:18:17.07,00:18:17.07,I PROMISE YOU.
639,00:18:17.60,00:18:17.60,"HALF OF ME BELIEVES HIM, HALF"
640,00:18:20.40,00:18:20.40,"OF ME IS LIKE... HE'S LIKE ""I'M"
641,00:18:22.93,00:18:22.93,"SUCH A GIRL."""
642,00:18:23.70,00:18:23.70,WHAT IS THAT?
643,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,CHRISTINA'S GOING FIRST?
644,00:18:26.60,00:18:26.60,"YES, JUST REMEMBER TO WRITE"
645,00:18:27.77,00:18:27.77,HER NAME DOWN.
646,00:18:28.47,00:18:28.47,"ALL RIGHT, GOOD DEAL?"
647,00:18:29.40,00:18:29.40,"OKAY, SWEET ENOUGH."
648,00:18:30.67,00:18:30.67,IT'S KIND OF LIKE COLTON'S
649,00:18:32.60,00:18:32.60,JUST RUNNING THE SHOWON BOTH
650,00:18:36.50,00:18:36.50,SIDES WITH THE WOMEN AND THE MEN
651,00:18:37.63,00:18:37.63,BUT IT WOULD BE RICK RIDICULOUS
652,00:18:40.17,00:18:40.17,FOR ME NOT TO THINK HE'S
653,00:18:41.73,00:18:41.73,ALIGNING WITH THE WOMEN RIGHT
