566,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,">> Tonight we're going to havea vote, and the logical choice"
567,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,for us to let someone go is tolet one of our two weaker
568,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,"players go.Which, obviously, is Courtney"
569,00:35:16.58,00:35:16.58,and Leslie.Leslie seems to be breaking
570,00:35:18.96,00:35:18.96,"down every single day, and thenCourtney, seriously, even if"
571,00:35:21.46,00:35:21.46,"she makes it past today or, Idon't see how this girl is"
572,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,going to live 30 days.I've seen anorexic girls have
573,00:35:27.71,00:35:27.71,more meat on their bones thanthis girl has.
574,00:35:30.04,00:35:30.04,"To me, we're just lucky theydidn't tell us one girl and"
575,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,one guy have to sit out today.That would have been really
576,00:35:38.17,00:35:38.17,brutal.>> How are your hands?
577,00:35:42.38,00:35:42.38,>> This game is not justphysical right now.
578,00:35:45.04,00:35:45.04,I'm trying to thinkstrategically as well.
579,00:35:47.21,00:35:47.21,It does bug me that Leslie wasso excited to go over to the
580,00:35:49.58,00:35:49.58,"other tribe.And, yeah, who knows what she's"
581,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,plotting with people over there.And... I don't know.
582,00:35:55.46,00:35:55.46,I want to get rid ofJean-Robert but at the same
583,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,"time, as far as challenges go,I want to keep Jean-Robert."
584,00:36:01.38,00:36:01.38,But who knows?>> PROBST: Behind each of you
585,00:36:17.54,00:36:17.54,is a torch.Go ahead and grab a torch.
586,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,Approach the flame.This is part of the ritual of
587,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,"tribal council because in thisgame, fire represents your life."
588,00:36:29.38,00:36:29.38,"As long as you have fire,you're still in the game."
589,00:36:31.50,00:36:31.50,"When your fire is gone, so areyou."
590,00:36:34.00,00:36:34.00,That will be the case for oneof you tonight.
591,00:36:41.21,00:36:41.21,"So, let's talk about thechallenges."
592,00:36:43.42,00:36:43.42,You guys started off verystrong.
593,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"Three wins in a row.Then, back-to-back losses."
594,00:36:47.92,00:36:47.92,Zhan Hu knows they can beatthis tribe.
595,00:36:50.79,00:36:50.79,"Jean-Robert, a little concerned?>> Very concerned."
596,00:36:53.42,00:36:53.42,"You know, you look at ourgroup, and, yeah, we might have"
597,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,"two of the three biggest guysin the whole thing, but we also"
598,00:36:58.12,00:36:58.12,"have two of the weakest girls,and that's just, that's just a"
599,00:37:00.29,00:37:00.29,matter of fact.>> PROBST: Who are the two weak?
600,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,"Obviously, you're going to bepointing to Courtney because"
601,00:37:05.04,00:37:05.04,she's the smallest.>> Courtney and Leslie is who I
602,00:37:07.21,00:37:07.21,am referring to.>> This is fun to live with.
603,00:37:09.38,00:37:09.38,>> This is the reality of thesituation.
604,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,This is our team.So we should be very careful
605,00:37:13.29,00:37:13.29,who we sit out so we're leftwith a more balanced team each
606,00:37:15.79,00:37:15.79,"time.>> PROBST: Courtney, that can't"
607,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,"feel good to hear.>> For the past nine days, it's"
608,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,like how can we possibly getCourtney and Todd and Leslie
609,00:37:23.17,00:37:23.17,to not play.And I'm like a little Chihuahua
610,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,trying to run a horse race sofar.
611,00:37:27.29,00:37:27.29,"Everything is like mudwrestling, or like winging"

615,00:37:35.25,00:37:35.25,"crap.""I'm just sick of being spoken"
616,00:37:37.21,00:37:37.21,"of, like, ""Where will you dothe least damage in this"

618,00:37:40.88,00:37:40.88,thinking.>> That's how it comes across
619,00:37:42.88,00:37:42.88,day after day.>> It's not that I perceive
620,00:37:45.04,00:37:45.04,Leslie as weak or Courtney asweak.
621,00:37:47.21,00:37:47.21,"To be honest...>> PROBST: Jean-Robert, that is"
622,00:37:48.92,00:37:48.92,"exactly what you said.>> Okay, the weaker of this"
623,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,group.It's the reality of the
624,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,situation.I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
625,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,"When it comes to the threestrongest girls, it is clearly"
626,00:37:58.17,00:37:58.17,"Denise, Amanda and then who?We're playing for a million"
627,00:38:00.96,00:38:00.96,dollars here.We're not babies in a
628,00:38:03.00,00:38:03.00,campground.Feelings are going to get hurt
629,00:38:04.75,00:38:04.75,or they're not going to gethurt.
630,00:38:06.71,00:38:06.71,I'm not known for holding mythoughts back.
631,00:38:08.62,00:38:08.62,I'm going to say exactly what Ithink but I'm keeping it real.
632,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,>> Can I say something?I spent a night with Zhan Hu.
633,00:38:14.71,00:38:14.71,And I saw not a strong physicaltribe but a strong heart.
634,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,They're united.They do things together.
635,00:38:21.08,00:38:21.08,"They have fun.You know, we may have all the"
636,00:38:23.29,00:38:23.29,"brawn in the world, but if wedon't have heart, we're not"
637,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,going to make it.Those people won that challenge
638,00:38:28.46,00:38:28.46,"because of this, not because ofthis."
639,00:38:32.46,00:38:32.46,">> PROBST: Jean-Robert, you atall concerned it might be you"
640,00:38:35.50,00:38:35.50,"tonight?>> Well, of course I'm"
641,00:38:37.33,00:38:37.33,"concerned it could be me.To be honest with you, Jeff,"
642,00:38:40.04,00:38:40.04,the heat's been on since daytwo.
643,00:38:42.08,00:38:42.08,"And somehow, the last few days,I've shown a little bit more,"
644,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,and I've pretty much kickedsome butt in the challenges.
645,00:38:46.67,00:38:46.67,"So tonight, my chances are alittle bit fair, but I'm still"
646,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,in jeopardy.I would say I'm definitely one
647,00:38:52.12,00:38:52.12,of the two or three peoplethat's in jeopardy in this tribe
648,00:38:54.88,00:38:54.88,and I'm really hoping to make itthrough tonight.
649,00:38:57.33,00:38:57.33,">> PROBST: All right, it istime to vote."

653,00:39:30.79,00:39:30.79,sounds like someone is chokinga walrus.

657,00:40:15.25,00:40:15.25,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.

666,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33,"Third person voted out ofSurvivor: China, Leslie."
667,00:41:07.25,00:41:07.25,That's five.That's enough.
668,00:41:09.17,00:41:09.17,"You need to bring me your torch.Leslie, the tribe has spoken."
669,00:41:24.21,00:41:24.21,Time for you to go.>> Okay.
