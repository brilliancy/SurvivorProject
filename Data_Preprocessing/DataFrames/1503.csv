22,00:01:05.67,00:01:05.67,around camp. And at the immunity challenge...

27,00:01:23.17,00:01:23.17,Dave knew he was in the hot seat.
28,00:01:25.92,00:01:25.92,>> I apologize. I feel like I let us down today.
29,00:01:28.92,00:01:28.92,>> Start the fire... >> Let me finish.
30,00:01:31.04,00:01:31.04,>> The fire... >> Let me finish.
31,00:01:33.12,00:01:33.12,>> PROBST: But his constant bickering with Ashley...

40,00:02:14.25,00:02:14.25,(snoring) >> Eww!
41,00:02:17.38,00:02:17.38,"Just, please don't. >> Jean-Robert, God love him, he"

43,00:02:30.42,00:02:30.42,"the women and we're just like, ""Eww, just please don't."""
44,00:02:33.50,00:02:33.50,I don't know what it is about him.
45,00:02:36.00,00:02:36.00,Maybe it's the silk shirt and the no underwear.
46,00:02:38.00,00:02:38.00,That did it for me. >> I need to be warm.
47,00:02:43.67,00:02:43.67,">> Look, will you stop snuggling so much because"
48,00:02:46.12,00:02:46.12,you're scaring the girls. (laughter)
49,00:02:48.79,00:02:48.79,>> I do get kind of a creep vibe from Jean-Robert and so
50,00:02:51.04,00:02:51.04,does Amanda. Neither one of us likes him.
51,00:02:53.54,00:02:53.54,I'm sure he's noticed she and I will both go to great pains to
52,00:02:57.00,00:02:57.00,"not be next to him in the shelter, and yet he will just"
53,00:03:00.12,00:03:00.12,"climb in there, and he's like, ""I need Amanda and Courtney by"
54,00:03:03.62,00:03:03.62,"my side. They keep me warm."""
55,00:03:06.58,00:03:06.58,Like I'm going to keep anyone warm.
56,00:03:08.38,00:03:08.38,I weigh seven pounds. I can't even keep myself warm.
57,00:03:10.46,00:03:10.46,"Get off of me. >> Call me creepy, if you want"
58,00:03:13.21,00:03:13.21,"to, but I need to be warm. >> I don't think Jean-Robert"

65,00:04:47.29,00:04:47.29,">> Yeah, we're going to be eating the crab."
66,00:04:48.79,00:04:48.79,Are you kidding me? We're going to be eating the
67,00:04:50.29,00:04:50.29,crab. >> Make a stew.
68,00:04:52.12,00:04:52.12,"Crab stew. >> That looks like a big crab,"
69,00:04:54.58,00:04:54.58,man. >> Are you guys going to cook
70,00:04:57.88,00:04:57.88,the crab? I think you should boil it
71,00:04:59.92,00:04:59.92,because then it will be like crab stock and you can put rice
72,00:05:02.17,00:05:02.17,in it and it will be like a whole meal.
73,00:05:04.50,00:05:04.50,>> You're not going to taste crabby rice from a crab that
74,00:05:06.50,00:05:06.50,big. >> It's better than the rice
75,00:05:08.08,00:05:08.08,with nothing we've been eating. >> The stock.
76,00:05:10.21,00:05:10.21,>> The stock. It's about stretching with eight
77,00:05:12.04,00:05:12.04,people. >> Stretching the crab?
78,00:05:14.00,00:05:14.00,There's eight of us and one crab.
79,00:05:15.79,00:05:15.79,">> Okay, okay, so there's only so much flavor in one crab."
80,00:05:18.00,00:05:18.00,">> So, fine, James caught the crab so he gets to eat it and"
81,00:05:19.71,00:05:19.71,the rest of us have plain rice. >> We don't work like that.
82,00:05:22.62,00:05:22.62,It's not like you grab kindling and nobody gets to sit around
83,00:05:24.88,00:05:24.88,the fire. >> The boys are just cranky.
84,00:05:27.92,00:05:27.92,"I know from experience, my husband, when he gets hungry,"
85,00:05:30.67,00:05:30.67,"gets really cranky, so I make sure that man is fed, okay?"
86,00:05:33.54,00:05:33.54,"And these guys are not getting fed, so it's like my husband"
87,00:05:36.08,00:05:36.08,times infinity. >> I understand that.
88,00:05:40.25,00:05:40.25,>> Nice crunchy and crispy right in my mouth.
89,00:05:41.92,00:05:41.92,">> We only have one, so next time..."
90,00:05:44.12,00:05:44.12,>> I know. I'm just saying this is what I
91,00:05:45.83,00:05:45.83,would like. >> But I want the damn crab
92,00:05:47.54,00:05:47.54,stock to put on the damn rice. >> Crab stock on the rice
93,00:05:49.58,00:05:49.58,"sounds good. >> Yeah, besides half a damn"
94,00:05:52.79,00:05:52.79,crab. Which you ain't even gonna get
95,00:05:55.17,00:05:55.17,a half a crab; you'll get a crab toenail.
96,00:05:57.21,00:05:57.21,>> That's cool. I'm down with you caught it and
97,00:05:59.08,00:05:59.08,"let's do what you want to do. >> All right, I'm with that,"
98,00:06:01.12,00:06:01.12,too. >> Damn.
99,00:06:03.21,00:06:03.21,>> It's frustrating with this team because they have a slow
100,00:06:05.12,00:06:05.12,learning curve. But it's hard to talk to these
101,00:06:06.96,00:06:06.96,guys. They keep bumping their heads.
102,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,I'm the only one that actually went to Barnes & Noble before
103,00:06:12.25,00:06:12.25,we got out here. I'm the only one that actually
104,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,went and read a survival handbook.
105,00:06:17.54,00:06:17.54,">> Oh, yeah! >> I don't eat outside."
106,00:06:20.25,00:06:20.25,I don't even like plastic or paper cups.
107,00:06:22.62,00:06:22.62,"I mean, I don't do nothing outside."
108,00:06:24.88,00:06:24.88,Four hours at Barnes & Noble and I know more than... I feel
109,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,"like Crocodile Dundee out here. >> Dave, why don't you sit and"
110,00:06:51.25,00:06:51.25,eat? >> I will.
111,00:06:53.08,00:06:53.08,>> I just want you to conserve your energy because I do not
112,00:06:55.88,00:06:55.88,want to lose another challenge. Dave doesn't seem to learn.
113,00:07:00.04,00:07:00.04,He knew that last challenge was him just burning out of energy.
114,00:07:04.17,00:07:04.17,And he doesn't seem to get it that he needs to rest.
115,00:07:12.17,00:07:12.17,">> No, I'll do the first one. Someone can do the next one."
116,00:07:17.33,00:07:17.33,Peih-gee. (kissing sound)
117,00:07:24.42,00:07:24.42,"Peih-gee, I've heard you, thank you, I'm checking myself"
118,00:07:26.62,00:07:26.62,constantly. Please.
119,00:07:29.21,00:07:29.21,"Cut me a wee bit of slack, you know what I mean?"
120,00:07:32.96,00:07:32.96,Peih-gee is just riding my butt about not getting enough rest.
121,00:07:36.62,00:07:36.62,In order to save your energy and to have energy for a
122,00:07:40.25,00:07:40.25,"challenge, you must efficiently expend some."
123,00:07:42.96,00:07:42.96,It is a balance. Camp doesn't sort itself out.
124,00:07:47.79,00:07:47.79,"If you don't sort out camp, challenges will tank."
125,00:07:51.67,00:07:51.67,It's not rocket science. >> We need to take better care
126,00:07:56.50,00:07:56.50,of our stuff. >> Just stick the wok through
127,00:08:04.04,00:08:04.04,it. >> Maybe if we had two sticks it
128,00:08:06.67,00:08:06.67,"wouldn't tip. >> Okay, look at me."
129,00:08:10.04,00:08:10.04,You've got a brick in the back and two bricks in the side.
130,00:08:13.12,00:08:13.12,"The fire's right here, right? >> Yeah, but the fire is"
131,00:08:15.62,00:08:15.62,smoldering out towards the front.
132,00:08:17.50,00:08:17.50,It's not really in between the bricks.
133,00:08:28.38,00:08:28.38,">> Yeah, I don't know why you're getting a brick."
134,00:08:30.12,00:08:30.12,"We already have one. >> Well, we've got an extra one"
135,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,just in case. I can hem and haw and waffle
136,00:08:34.42,00:08:34.42,about it all day long or just put a brick on it and go.
137,00:08:37.42,00:08:37.42,"This is my whinge for the moment, and that's me and I'm"
138,00:08:40.50,00:08:40.50,"done. So if you take offense, I"
139,00:08:43.17,00:08:43.17,"apologize, but in the amount of time it took me to get up, grab"
140,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,a brick and just do it versus the time it took to question
141,00:08:49.38,00:08:49.38,"it, it just took so much more time and effort."
142,00:08:53.21,00:08:53.21,">> The only thing that we were saying is that if you just,"
143,00:08:55.62,00:08:55.62,"like, sat there for, like, two more seconds, they already"
144,00:08:58.96,00:08:58.96,"had the brick right there. >> Well, forgive me, I'm..."
145,00:09:01.92,00:09:01.92,">> Erik, can you hand me some of that branch?"
146,00:09:04.21,00:09:04.21,">> Yeah, Dave's pushing a whole lot of people and he needs to"
147,00:09:06.58,00:09:06.58,chill out. We were looking at him and
148,00:09:08.83,00:09:08.83,"Ashley last night, and today of all days should be the day when"
149,00:09:12.12,00:09:12.12,he should just be happy that he's here.
150,00:09:14.88,00:09:14.88,">> I haven't even busted my ass, and I'm already done, you"
151,00:09:17.08,00:09:17.08,know what I mean? >> I know it's a game where
152,00:09:19.62,00:09:19.62,"it's everyone for himself, but I really do have a lot of faith"
153,00:09:22.54,00:09:22.54,"in our tribe, and you kind of have to look out for each other"
154,00:09:26.17,00:09:26.17,if we want to do well at challenges.
155,00:09:35.12,00:09:35.12,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Fei Long, your first look at"
156,00:09:46.92,00:09:46.92,the new Zhan Hu tribe. Ashley voted out last night.
157,00:09:50.96,00:09:50.96,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?

161,00:10:01.67,00:10:01.67,"sides of a boat. On my go, you will engage in"
162,00:10:05.08,00:10:05.08,hand-to-hand battle. Your goal: throw the opposing
163,00:10:09.50,00:10:09.50,tribe members off the boat into the water.
164,00:10:13.08,00:10:13.08,First tribe to get all the tribe members of the other
165,00:10:15.75,00:10:15.75,tribe into the water scores a point.
166,00:10:17.71,00:10:17.71,"We will alternate, women on women, men on men."
167,00:10:21.17,00:10:21.17,First tribe to get three points wins reward.
168,00:10:24.92,00:10:24.92,You want to know what you're playing for?
169,00:10:26.50,00:10:26.50,>> Yes. >> Yes.
170,00:10:27.96,00:10:27.96,">> Oh, yeah. >> Yes!"

197,00:12:15.08,00:12:15.08,to give him an advantage or make him very vulnerable.
198,00:12:18.12,00:12:18.12,"For Zhan Hu, it's Frosti, Erik, and Dave."

204,00:12:44.71,00:12:44.71,This is odd. Dave attacks Aaron and pulls
205,00:12:49.17,00:12:49.17,"him in. >> Go, Dave!"

268,00:16:49.04,00:16:49.04,Who are you going to steal? >> Leslie.

273,00:17:09.75,00:17:09.75,Open it. >> Okay.

278,00:17:39.33,00:17:39.33,I was so excited to win the reward challenge.
279,00:17:41.21,00:17:41.21,"Not only did we get pillows and blankets and a tarp, we also"
280,00:17:44.21,00:17:44.21,able to kidnap Leslie to our tribe.
281,00:17:48.33,00:17:48.33,">> I'm really happy for you guys, I am."
282,00:17:50.21,00:17:50.21,>> I appreciate that. >> And I mean it.
283,00:17:52.08,00:17:52.08,>> You're genuine. You can tell.
284,00:17:53.92,00:17:53.92,>> That's why we wanted you over here.
285,00:17:55.54,00:17:55.54,>> That's why I'm going to watch my mouth and keep my
286,00:17:57.12,00:17:57.12,"drawers on just for you. I have been anyway, but I'll be"
287,00:18:01.71,00:18:01.71,even more so for you. >> We're so glad you're here.
288,00:18:04.96,00:18:04.96,We have plenty of room for you. >> We'll make you a nice dinner.
289,00:18:08.12,00:18:08.12,">> Morale-wise, this camp seems to have a leg up."
290,00:18:11.04,00:18:11.04,And that's impressive because they've already lost two
291,00:18:13.29,00:18:13.29,people. And for them to be still so
292,00:18:15.38,00:18:15.38,"excited, that's pretty impressive."
293,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,(laughter) >> Ooh!
294,00:18:27.88,00:18:27.88,That hurt watching that. >> Yeah.
295,00:18:38.62,00:18:38.62,"You know what, though, I think we just have a lot of strong"
296,00:18:41.08,00:18:41.08,personalities. He's like my boy.
297,00:18:45.25,00:18:45.25,"He calls me mama. Yeah, he's nice."
298,00:18:49.58,00:18:49.58,">> He's nice, but he... he controls a lot."
299,00:18:52.42,00:18:52.42,">> He's controlling, but we elected him leader."
300,00:18:55.29,00:18:55.29,">> Why, is he really smart or something?"
301,00:18:57.25,00:18:57.25,>> He just kind of took over when we got there.
302,00:19:00.54,00:19:00.54,">> We got quite a good bit of information from Leslie, but it"
303,00:19:03.92,00:19:03.92,"was more in a kind of fun, girls gossiping."
304,00:19:07.67,00:19:07.67,"You can get the same results, but you can do them in a happy,"
305,00:19:11.33,00:19:11.33,nice way. >> Uh-huh.
306,00:19:16.21,00:19:16.21,And Erik's a Christian and Jaime's a Christian.
307,00:19:19.12,00:19:19.12,Wow. I'm misunderstood over in my
308,00:19:21.29,00:19:21.29,tribe. My faith is everything.
309,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,"I'm here to love people and to show them the love of Christ,"
310,00:19:27.62,00:19:27.62,and I can see that they appreciate that here.
311,00:19:31.08,00:19:31.08,It differs a lot over at Fei Long.
312,00:19:34.04,00:19:34.04,I try not to talk about it a lot over there.
313,00:19:36.08,00:19:36.08,"They're very cynical over there, and that can be really"
314,00:19:38.42,00:19:38.42,tough. >> The old woman is not going
315,00:19:45.71,00:19:45.71,to pull a rope. She's going to be hurt.
316,00:19:47.88,00:19:47.88,>> Talking about Sister Christian?
317,00:19:49.33,00:19:49.33,">> Yeah, Sister Christian. She ain't going to last too"
318,00:19:51.08,00:19:51.08,"long. And for some reason, you're all"
319,00:19:52.58,00:19:52.58,"buying that prayer stuff. >> Come on, dude."
320,00:19:54.83,00:19:54.83,>> The people who pray the most sin the most.
321,00:19:56.08,00:19:56.08,That's why they're praying. Because they know they're going
322,00:19:58.17,00:19:58.17,to hell. (laughter)
323,00:20:05.88,00:20:05.88,">> You got your strategy all worked out, man?"
324,00:20:08.38,00:20:08.38,">> You need to stay, Denise needs to stay, and I need to"
325,00:20:13.54,00:20:13.54,stay for a while. >> I feel myself distancing
326,00:20:16.54,00:20:16.54,from Todd. I felt kind of a bond with him
327,00:20:18.67,00:20:18.67,"right away, but he's, like, kind of tuned me out."
328,00:20:21.46,00:20:21.46,"And Courtney, of course, I'm not in with."
329,00:20:23.46,00:20:23.46,But I'm not worried about that because she's going to be first
330,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,to go. >> You think?
331,00:20:27.67,00:20:27.67,">> I mean, who else would be first to go?"
332,00:20:29.21,00:20:29.21,Denise or Courtney? >> Courtney and I were cutting
333,00:20:34.46,00:20:34.46,"this husk for a fire off of a tree, and we were literally,"
334,00:20:38.54,00:20:38.54,"you know, 20 yards away from Jean-Robert and James, in full"
335,00:20:42.58,00:20:42.58,"view, and they were talking at the top of their lungs about"
336,00:20:45.62,00:20:45.62,"how Courtney needs to go first. I'm thinking, ""Dude, she's"
337,00:20:48.42,00:20:48.42,"right here."" >> Ooh!"
338,00:20:50.83,00:20:50.83,"Another clam. >> Dude, who should we be"
339,00:20:54.29,00:20:54.29,"voting, Leslie or Courtney? >> Courtney does work."
340,00:20:58.54,00:20:58.54,>> What do you mean she's does work?
341,00:21:00.42,00:21:00.42,What does she do? >> She moves stuff.
342,00:21:02.21,00:21:02.21,">> Look at what she's moving. She's moving, like, two twigs."
343,00:21:06.25,00:21:06.25,"Plus, you like Courtney. A million dollars is one"
344,00:21:13.00,00:21:13.00,thing but if you can get a million dollars and some ass.
345,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,"Come on, James. You know you like that little"
346,00:21:19.75,00:21:19.75,"70-pound blonde. Come on, man."
347,00:21:24.38,00:21:24.38,The only thing better than a million dollars is a million
348,00:21:26.71,00:21:26.71,"dollars and some ass. Come on, now."
349,00:21:29.12,00:21:29.12,>> The only thing better than a million dollars is a million
350,00:21:30.92,00:21:30.92,"dollars and a sandwich. >> All right, you know what?"
351,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50,"Just for you, I'm going to look out for you."
352,00:21:35.42,00:21:35.42,"You stick with me, we're going to do all right."
353,00:21:37.38,00:21:37.38,"So we'll go for Leslie. >> Oh, my attitude towards the"
354,00:21:47.08,00:21:47.08,two of them is going to change around camp.
355,00:21:51.75,00:21:51.75,"Thank you, James. You've got to take care of"
356,00:21:55.92,00:21:55.92,"taking out the trash. And as far as I'm concerned,"
357,00:21:59.50,00:21:59.50,James and Jean-Robert are the trash.
358,00:22:02.54,00:22:02.54,">> All right, family. Family swim."
359,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,"Todd, you need to take your stinky ass in the water, too."
360,00:22:08.00,00:22:08.00,>> I don't care if it's tomorrow.
361,00:22:09.54,00:22:09.54,I don't care if it's five days from now.
362,00:22:11.29,00:22:11.29,I don't care if it's nine days from now.
363,00:22:13.38,00:22:13.38,"Any more than that, trash gets stinky."
364,00:22:16.04,00:22:16.04,"They got to go. >> Yesterday, at the reward"
365,00:22:34.38,00:22:34.38,"challenge, Jeff Probst gave me a tube."
366,00:22:37.38,00:22:37.38,"I kind of knew what was in the tube because, when Jaime was"
367,00:22:40.38,00:22:40.38,"kidnapped by our camp, she had the same thing."
368,00:22:44.38,00:22:44.38,"""You must give the sealed clue to a member of this tribe before"
369,00:22:47.75,00:22:47.75,"you rejoin your own tribe at the next immunity challenge."""
370,00:22:51.92,00:22:51.92,"Hey, guys. What I was thinking was, since"
371,00:22:56.25,00:22:56.25,"Jaime gave me the clue from the other tribe, I can return the"
372,00:22:59.75,00:22:59.75,favor. Is there a place I can go and
373,00:23:02.21,00:23:02.21,"change? >> Yeah, definitely."
374,00:23:04.54,00:23:04.54,>> Like a place to... >> You want me to go show you?
375,00:23:06.58,00:23:06.58,">> Yeah, would you mind? >> I think I understand her."
376,00:23:13.83,00:23:13.83,I think she understands me. And that's the best part.
377,00:23:16.54,00:23:16.54,I'm picking up what she's putting down.

379,00:23:28.33,00:23:28.33,"anyone else on the other team, so it was really good to get"
380,00:23:30.71,00:23:30.71,her over here. And she gave me the clue for
381,00:23:33.25,00:23:33.25,"the hidden immunity idol. So altogether, it worked out"
382,00:23:35.62,00:23:35.62,"really well for me. >> Yeah, these are closer."

508,00:31:35.04,00:31:35.04,yesterday's challenge just kind of reaffirms the fact that we
509,00:31:38.04,00:31:38.04,need strength. We need brawn on our team.
510,00:31:41.50,00:31:41.50,"So, I think common sense will prevail and they're going to be"
511,00:31:46.12,00:31:46.12,getting rid of one of the two weakest women on the squad.

514,00:31:55.12,00:31:55.12,">> I think they're all, like, friendly over there."
515,00:31:58.12,00:31:58.12,It's a very friendly tribe. Three of them are Christians
516,00:32:00.42,00:32:00.42,"over there, which is I think why they picked me."
517,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,Three of them are Christians. >> Which ones?
518,00:32:05.92,00:32:05.92,>> Sherea and Jaime and Erik. >> What did they think about us?
519,00:32:09.54,00:32:09.54,>> They didn't really know a whole lot about you.
520,00:32:11.62,00:32:11.62,I told them little bits about you guys.
521,00:32:14.21,00:32:14.21,"I said Aaron's our leader, whether he likes it or not."
522,00:32:18.83,00:32:18.83,They knew. They could tell.
523,00:32:21.12,00:32:21.12,>> You put my head in the guillotine.
524,00:32:23.04,00:32:23.04,">> No, I didn't, they knew! >> They knew?"
525,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,>> They knew! Jaime told them.
526,00:32:26.96,00:32:26.96,Come on. >> Leslie going over to Zhan
527,00:32:30.25,00:32:30.25,"Hu, being kidnapped, major liability for us."
528,00:32:33.46,00:32:33.46,"You know, she doesn't, she doesn't think, you know,"
529,00:32:36.21,00:32:36.21,"because I don't know if it's her heart or what, just"
530,00:32:39.25,00:32:39.25,overcomes her brain. But really what scares me is
531,00:32:42.33,00:32:42.33,"once the merge happens, you know, what kind of bond is"
532,00:32:45.92,00:32:45.92,"Leslie going to be involved with because you can't, can't"
533,00:32:49.25,00:32:49.25,"really trust her. >> I mean, I'm trying, and the"
534,00:32:56.75,00:32:56.75,"thing is, if we had a nice camp, I think I could put up with the"
535,00:32:59.21,00:32:59.21,"challenges and this. But, like, our camp is"
536,00:33:02.17,00:33:02.17,miserable. >> You mean the people?
537,00:33:04.04,00:33:04.04,>> Yeah. >> So if we didn't have
538,00:33:06.12,00:33:06.12,"Jean-Robert, how would that change your life?"
539,00:33:09.25,00:33:09.25,>> Jean-Robert and James have to go.
540,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,>> We ought to bust those two up.
541,00:33:12.88,00:33:12.88,">> So you guys are going for Jean-Robert, right?"
542,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,">> Yes, I mean, I promised I would."
543,00:33:16.96,00:33:16.96,">> Okay, I'm go to leave you guys."
544,00:33:18.62,00:33:18.62,I just wanted to... >> We ought to break those two
545,00:33:21.79,00:33:21.79,up. They're causing trouble.
546,00:33:23.67,00:33:23.67,"But, Courtney, I'm worried about you."
547,00:33:32.21,00:33:32.21,>> We have to think about later in the game.
548,00:33:40.58,00:33:40.58,>> She'll be a vote for us. We need her.
549,00:33:44.17,00:33:44.17,Do you really think we'll lose a lot of challenges without
550,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,Jean-Robert? It's not like we're getting rid
551,00:33:49.21,00:33:49.21,of James and Aaron. So...
552,00:34:05.08,00:34:05.08,>> I don't want to vote Jean- Robert out because of the
553,00:34:07.88,00:34:07.88,"challenges. You know, people will try and"
554,00:34:16.00,00:34:16.00,"find, you know, the tie that binds, you know, so..."
555,00:34:20.25,00:34:20.25,I want to be around a while. I don't want to go to the
556,00:34:22.54,00:34:22.54,"merger and get picked off. >> He can easily, easily, jump"
557,00:34:28.79,00:34:28.79,over to someone else's side... >> I'm sure.
558,00:34:31.25,00:34:31.25,>> ...and pick us off one by one to get him one step further.
559,00:34:34.12,00:34:34.12,">> Right, and I just feel Leslie is more dangerous than"
560,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,Jean-Robert in that jumping way.
561,00:34:41.75,00:34:41.75,"So we need to take her out. >> Right now, it would be"
562,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,"between Leslie and Jean-Robert, but further down the line, I"
563,00:34:50.54,00:34:50.54,"don't want to be competing, me up against these huge guys."
564,00:34:55.08,00:34:55.08,I don't want to lose my numbers on my tribe by getting rid of
565,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,"them now, but down the line, I don't want them here because"
566,00:35:02.12,00:35:02.12,"they're going to beat me, and that's not okay."
567,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,">> Tonight we're going to have a vote, and the logical choice"
568,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,for us to let someone go is to let one of our two weaker
569,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,"players go. Which, obviously, is Courtney"
570,00:35:16.58,00:35:16.58,and Leslie. Leslie seems to be breaking
571,00:35:18.96,00:35:18.96,"down every single day, and then Courtney, seriously, even if"
572,00:35:21.46,00:35:21.46,"she makes it past today or, I don't see how this girl is"
573,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,going to live 30 days. I've seen anorexic girls have
574,00:35:27.71,00:35:27.71,more meat on their bones than this girl has.
575,00:35:30.04,00:35:30.04,"To me, we're just lucky they didn't tell us one girl and"
576,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,one guy have to sit out today. That would have been really
577,00:35:38.17,00:35:38.17,brutal. >> How are your hands?
578,00:35:42.38,00:35:42.38,>> This game is not just physical right now.
579,00:35:45.04,00:35:45.04,I'm trying to think strategically as well.
580,00:35:47.21,00:35:47.21,It does bug me that Leslie was so excited to go over to the
581,00:35:49.58,00:35:49.58,"other tribe. And, yeah, who knows what she's"
582,00:35:52.00,00:35:52.00,plotting with people over there. And... I don't know.
583,00:35:55.46,00:35:55.46,I want to get rid of Jean-Robert but at the same
584,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,"time, as far as challenges go, I want to keep Jean-Robert."
585,00:36:01.38,00:36:01.38,But who knows? >> PROBST: Behind each of you
586,00:36:17.54,00:36:17.54,is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch.
587,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,Approach the flame. This is part of the ritual of
588,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,"tribal council because in this game, fire represents your life."
589,00:36:29.38,00:36:29.38,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
590,00:36:31.50,00:36:31.50,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
591,00:36:34.00,00:36:34.00,That will be the case for one of you tonight.
592,00:36:41.21,00:36:41.21,"So, let's talk about the challenges."
593,00:36:43.42,00:36:43.42,You guys started off very strong.
594,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"Three wins in a row. Then, back-to-back losses."
595,00:36:47.92,00:36:47.92,Zhan Hu knows they can beat this tribe.
596,00:36:50.79,00:36:50.79,"Jean-Robert, a little concerned? >> Very concerned."
597,00:36:53.42,00:36:53.42,"You know, you look at our group, and, yeah, we might have"
598,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,"two of the three biggest guys in the whole thing, but we also"
599,00:36:58.12,00:36:58.12,"have two of the weakest girls, and that's just, that's just a"
600,00:37:00.29,00:37:00.29,matter of fact. >> PROBST: Who are the two weak?
601,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,"Obviously, you're going to be pointing to Courtney because"
602,00:37:05.04,00:37:05.04,she's the smallest. >> Courtney and Leslie is who I
603,00:37:07.21,00:37:07.21,am referring to. >> This is fun to live with.
604,00:37:09.38,00:37:09.38,>> This is the reality of the situation.
605,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,This is our team. So we should be very careful
606,00:37:13.29,00:37:13.29,who we sit out so we're left with a more balanced team each
607,00:37:15.79,00:37:15.79,"time. >> PROBST: Courtney, that can't"
608,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,"feel good to hear. >> For the past nine days, it's"
609,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,like how can we possibly get Courtney and Todd and Leslie
610,00:37:23.17,00:37:23.17,to not play. And I'm like a little Chihuahua
611,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,trying to run a horse race so far.
612,00:37:27.29,00:37:27.29,"Everything is like mud wrestling, or like winging"
613,00:37:29.08,00:37:29.08,"people off a boat. They're like, ""Crap, we have"
614,00:37:31.58,00:37:31.58,to put her in. Where will she do the least
615,00:37:33.46,00:37:33.46,"damage?"" And I'm like, ""I don't give a"
616,00:37:35.25,00:37:35.25,"crap."" I'm just sick of being spoken"
617,00:37:37.21,00:37:37.21,"of, like, ""Where will you do the least damage in this"
618,00:37:38.79,00:37:38.79,"challenge?"" >> That's not what we were"
619,00:37:40.88,00:37:40.88,thinking. >> That's how it comes across
620,00:37:42.88,00:37:42.88,day after day. >> It's not that I perceive
621,00:37:45.04,00:37:45.04,Leslie as weak or Courtney as weak.
622,00:37:47.21,00:37:47.21,"To be honest... >> PROBST: Jean-Robert, that is"
623,00:37:48.92,00:37:48.92,"exactly what you said. >> Okay, the weaker of this"
624,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,group. It's the reality of the
625,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,situation. I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
626,00:37:56.21,00:37:56.21,"When it comes to the three strongest girls, it is clearly"
627,00:37:58.17,00:37:58.17,"Denise, Amanda and then who? We're playing for a million"
628,00:38:00.96,00:38:00.96,dollars here. We're not babies in a
629,00:38:03.00,00:38:03.00,campground. Feelings are going to get hurt
630,00:38:04.75,00:38:04.75,or they're not going to get hurt.
631,00:38:06.71,00:38:06.71,I'm not known for holding my thoughts back.
632,00:38:08.62,00:38:08.62,I'm going to say exactly what I think but I'm keeping it real.
633,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,>> Can I say something? I spent a night with Zhan Hu.
634,00:38:14.71,00:38:14.71,And I saw not a strong physical tribe but a strong heart.
635,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,They're united. They do things together.
636,00:38:21.08,00:38:21.08,"They have fun. You know, we may have all the"
637,00:38:23.29,00:38:23.29,"brawn in the world, but if we don't have heart, we're not"
638,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,going to make it. Those people won that challenge
639,00:38:28.46,00:38:28.46,"because of this, not because of this."
640,00:38:32.46,00:38:32.46,">> PROBST: Jean-Robert, you at all concerned it might be you"
641,00:38:35.50,00:38:35.50,"tonight? >> Well, of course I'm"
642,00:38:37.33,00:38:37.33,"concerned it could be me. To be honest with you, Jeff,"
643,00:38:40.04,00:38:40.04,the heat's been on since day two.
644,00:38:42.08,00:38:42.08,"And somehow, the last few days, I've shown a little bit more,"
645,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,and I've pretty much kicked some butt in the challenges.
646,00:38:46.67,00:38:46.67,"So tonight, my chances are a little bit fair, but I'm still"
647,00:38:49.33,00:38:49.33,in jeopardy. I would say I'm definitely one
648,00:38:52.12,00:38:52.12,of the two or three people that's in jeopardy in this tribe
649,00:38:54.88,00:38:54.88,and I'm really hoping to make it through tonight.
650,00:38:57.33,00:38:57.33,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to vote."
651,00:38:59.12,00:38:59.12,"Aaron, you're up. >> Sorry, mother hen."
652,00:39:11.79,00:39:11.79,All your chicks in China are grown up.
653,00:39:27.04,00:39:27.04,">> I'm voting for you because, when you snore at nighttime, it"
654,00:39:30.79,00:39:30.79,sounds like someone is choking a walrus.
655,00:40:00.12,00:40:00.12,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
656,00:40:11.46,00:40:11.46,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
657,00:40:13.29,00:40:13.29,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
658,00:40:15.25,00:40:15.25,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
659,00:40:21.08,00:40:21.08,"First vote, Jean-Robert. Leslie."
660,00:40:28.29,00:40:28.29,One vote Leslie. Jean-Robert.
661,00:40:34.17,00:40:34.17,Two votes Jean-Robert. Sister Christian.
662,00:40:41.08,00:40:41.08,"That's Leslie. We're tied, two votes Jean-"
663,00:40:43.33,00:40:43.33,"Robert, two votes Leslie. Leslie."
664,00:40:48.17,00:40:48.17,"That's three votes Leslie, two votes Jean-Robert."
665,00:40:54.12,00:40:54.12,Mom. That's Leslie.
666,00:40:56.96,00:40:56.96,"That's four votes Leslie, two votes Jean-Robert."
667,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33,"Third person voted out of Survivor: China, Leslie."
668,00:41:07.25,00:41:07.25,That's five. That's enough.
669,00:41:09.17,00:41:09.17,"You need to bring me your torch. Leslie, the tribe has spoken."
670,00:41:24.21,00:41:24.21,Time for you to go. >> Okay.
671,00:41:34.96,00:41:34.96,">> PROBST: Well, it seems like the big themes from tonight's"
672,00:41:37.12,00:41:37.12,tribal council are this tribe needs to have a little more
673,00:41:40.75,00:41:40.75,"fun, and this tribe needs to do a better job of utilizing each"
674,00:41:43.58,00:41:43.58,"person's unique strength. Grab your torches, head back"
675,00:41:47.17,00:41:47.17,to camp. Good night.
676,00:42:07.04,00:42:07.04,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
677,00:42:11.21,00:42:11.21,>> PROBST: Next time on  Survivor...
678,00:42:13.46,00:42:13.46,>> Don't touch that. Don't touch that.
679,00:42:15.12,00:42:15.12,">> PROBST: ...at Fei Long, things heat up between Courtney"
680,00:42:16.79,00:42:16.79,and Jean-Robert. >> If Courtney survives the
681,00:42:19.08,00:42:19.08,"next tribal council, she's got to be the luckiest girl in"
682,00:42:21.25,00:42:21.25,"Survivor history. >> PROBST: At Zhan Hu, Sherea"
683,00:42:24.17,00:42:24.17,blows her cool. >> Don't walk up on me again.
684,00:42:27.62,00:42:27.62,>> PROBST: And both tribes get a lesson in the art of war.

689,00:42:39.08,00:42:39.08,"I chased the dream, and I would have liked to have been here"
690,00:42:41.33,00:42:41.33,"longer, of course, but I always knew going into this game that"
691,00:42:43.88,00:42:43.88,I would be here as long as God wanted me to be here.
692,00:42:46.04,00:42:46.04,"Apparently, He's ready for me to go home."
693,00:42:48.25,00:42:48.25,"I don't understand why they vote me out, but I really hope"
694,00:42:50.21,00:42:50.21,that my tribe made the right decision.
695,00:42:52.08,00:42:52.08,It had to have been a tough one for them.
696,00:42:53.67,00:42:53.67,But I had a great time. I would do it again in a
697,00:42:54.96,00:42:54.96,heartbeat.
