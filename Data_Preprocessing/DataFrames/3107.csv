593,00:30:08.40,00:30:09.23,SHE'S SUPER DANGEROUS.
594,00:30:09.23,00:30:14.00,SHE MAKES UP THESE LIES THAT AREKIND OF BELIEVABLE.
595,00:30:14.00,00:30:14.53,THEY'RE ALWAYS...
596,00:30:14.53,00:30:16.77,>> SHE WASN'T EVEN THE WORST.
597,00:30:16.77,00:30:17.97,I THOUGHT KASS WAS MUCH WORST.
598,00:30:17.97,00:30:20.17,>> I THINK THEY'RE BOTH FEEDINGOFF EACH OTHER.
599,00:30:20.17,00:30:21.57,>> HOW DO WE DO THIS?
600,00:30:21.57,00:30:24.90,>> I FEEL LIKE KASS IS KIND OFSTIRRING UP THE MOST RIGHT NOW.
601,00:30:24.90,00:30:27.50,>> WITH THIS VOTE I'D RATHERHAVE CIERA GO.
602,00:30:27.50,00:30:29.27,SHE IS SO DANGEROUS.
603,00:30:29.27,00:30:32.57,FOR ME SHE'S PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBERONE AND HAS TO GO.
604,00:30:32.57,00:30:34.63,>> I'M LEANING TOWARD KASS.
605,00:30:34.63,00:30:37.37,>> THAT'S A AN ACROSS-THE-BOARDVOTE.
606,00:30:37.37,00:30:41.23,">> AT THIS POINT IF THE MAJORITYWANTS KASS, SOMETIMES IT'S BEST"
607,00:30:41.23,00:30:44.33,"JUST TO GO WITH THE MAJORITY,BECAUSE KASS IS ALMOST A LITTLE"
608,00:30:44.33,00:30:51.00,"RUTHLESS AND A LITTLE BITHAPHAZARD, AND THAT SCARES ME."
609,00:30:51.00,00:30:55.03,>> AS FAR AS WHO YOU WANT TO DO?
610,00:30:55.03,00:30:59.97,IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE WHO ISCAUSING PROBLEMS.
611,00:30:59.97,00:31:00.53,WHO DO YOU THINK?

622,00:31:27.60,00:31:30.77,CAN.
623,00:31:30.77,00:31:32.23,>> I DON'T THINK SHE DOES.
624,00:31:32.23,00:31:35.57,>> IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY ISVOTING KASS.
625,00:31:35.57,00:31:39.43,"BUT KASS COULD HAVE AN IDOL, YOUKNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
626,00:31:39.43,00:31:41.30,IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SPLIT VOTES.
627,00:31:41.30,00:31:43.90,>> I KNOW I'M VOTING KASS.
628,00:31:43.90,00:31:44.53,>> KASS.
629,00:31:44.53,00:31:44.97,>> KASS.
