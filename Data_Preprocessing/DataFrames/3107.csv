662,00:32:10.67,00:32:10.67,I'M GOING TO RECONFIRM WITH EVERYBODY.
663,00:32:13.63,00:32:13.63,BUT STEPHEN APPARENTLY HAS MORE CONNECTIONS IN THIS GAME THAN I

676,00:32:47.53,00:32:47.53,THE GREAT THING ABOUT TRIBAL IS IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER.
677,00:32:50.63,00:32:50.63,I'M SO FRICKEN TIRED OF THEIR HALF-ASS PLANS.
678,00:32:53.90,00:32:53.90,WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR?

686,00:33:11.23,00:33:11.23,I GUESS I'M HOPING FOR A MIRACLE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL IDEALLY.

691,00:33:47.70,00:33:47.70,YOU DIDN'T THINK PEOPLE WERE PLAYING.
692,00:33:50.37,00:33:50.37,DID THAT THEME CONTINUE ON AFTER TRIBAL?
693,00:33:52.43,00:33:52.43,>> YES.

695,00:33:55.73,00:33:55.73,NOBODY IS FIGHTING FOR THEIR SPOT IN THE TOP.
696,00:33:58.60,00:33:58.60,IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME.

698,00:34:03.03,00:34:03.03,THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE RUNNING THIS GAME.

726,00:35:18.80,00:35:18.80,WHO ARE MAKING DECISIONS AS A GROUP.
