379,00:21:35.62,00:21:35.62,">> Yeah, go.>> All right."
380,00:21:37.04,00:21:37.04,>> Get going.>> You guys want to go.
381,00:21:38.67,00:21:38.67,"Have fun.>> Okay, we'll be right back."
382,00:21:40.29,00:21:40.29,">> Bye.>> You know, there is a"
383,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"possibility, very slight, thatthey might get rid of Matty"
384,00:21:55.58,00:21:55.58,if he doesn't win immunity.>> Here's what I'm thinking...
385,00:21:58.29,00:21:58.29,">> You guys, don't you thinkit's weird that there's a tribe"
386,00:22:00.71,00:22:00.71,of people are living togetherand a couple that of them know
387,00:22:03.08,00:22:03.08,they're going?It's so weird.
388,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,">> They're outside, outskirts.>> As for now, our five are"
389,00:22:07.12,00:22:07.12,sticking together because wehave a better chance that way.
390,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17,"Hopefully, nobody's goingto flip."
391,00:22:16.08,00:22:16.08,>> He's good at everything.You're the only person that
392,00:22:18.17,00:22:18.17,"stands a chance against Bob ina physical challenge, really."
393,00:22:20.88,00:22:20.88,">> Yeah.>> That's true, Matty."
394,00:22:22.79,00:22:22.79,>> The plan is to vote out Boband then Corinne because Bob is
395,00:22:26.29,00:22:26.29,way bigger of a threat.>> Remember when we threw the
396,00:22:36.08,00:22:36.08,idol into the ocean?>> Yes.
397,00:22:38.21,00:22:38.21,>> And they never went andchecked the bottle.
398,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,But Marcus threw it in.Did you know that he had the
399,00:22:45.46,00:22:45.46,idol in his pocket when he cameback and hid it around camp?
400,00:22:49.08,00:22:49.08,"And showed me where it was.And said, ""It's hidden over"
401,00:22:52.08,00:22:52.08,"here."">> No way."
402,00:22:53.50,00:22:53.50,"He didn't have it when he wentto Tribal, so if I win immunity,"
403,00:22:57.12,00:22:57.12,I can give that to you.>> That's a legit idol?
404,00:23:00.12,00:23:00.12,">> No, but it sounded prettygood, didn't it?"
405,00:23:02.00,00:23:02.00,">> Oh. Yeah, it did sound good.>> I'm going to put it together,"
406,00:23:07.12,00:23:07.12,and I'm going to imply that I'vegot the idol we were supposed
407,00:23:11.04,00:23:11.04,to have thrown in the ocean.>> Wow.
408,00:23:13.21,00:23:13.21,>> I am going to make my secondvery good fake idol of the game.
409,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,"And the plan with the idol is,I'm going to tell somebody on"
410,00:23:21.67,00:23:21.67,the other side that I've got thethe original idol that was
411,00:23:25.29,00:23:25.29,"supposed to have gone into theocean, so they've got to be"
412,00:23:28.21,00:23:28.21,"careful how they vote.>> Good for you, Bob."
413,00:23:35.08,00:23:35.08,"Good plan.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
414,00:23:47.33,00:23:47.33,You guys ready to get to today'simmunity challenge?
415,00:23:49.71,00:23:49.71,>> You got it.>> Yes.
416,00:23:51.12,00:23:51.12,">> PROBST: First things first--Kenny, give it up."
417,00:23:54.29,00:23:54.29,"(laughs)Once again, immunity is back up"

419,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,going to ask you questionsabout Gabon.
420,00:24:02.46,00:24:02.46,"Each time you answer correctly,you earn a ball."
421,00:24:05.50,00:24:05.50,You're then going to take turnsthrowing your balls toward
422,00:24:08.71,00:24:08.71,a target divided by zones.The person who lands their ball
423,00:24:12.54,00:24:12.54,"in a zone closest to the centerwins immunity, guaranteed a"
424,00:24:16.42,00:24:16.42,one-in-six shot at winning thisgame.
425,00:24:21.12,00:24:21.12,Losers go to Tribal Councilwhere somebody will be voted
426,00:24:23.21,00:24:23.21,out.Anything not clear?
427,00:24:25.54,00:24:25.54,"Let's get started.All right, here we go."
428,00:24:29.08,00:24:29.08,"First question, true or false:gorillas were actually first"
429,00:24:33.08,00:24:33.08,"discovered here in Gabon?All right, everybody, reveal."
430,00:24:45.29,00:24:45.29,Correct answer is...true.
431,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,Sugar got it right.Corinne got it right.
432,00:24:50.96,00:24:50.96,Gorillas were discovered herein 1847.
433,00:24:54.83,00:24:54.83,Sugar gets a ball.Corinne gets a ball.
434,00:24:58.08,00:24:58.08,Next question: a male elephantis called a bull.
435,00:25:03.00,00:25:03.00,"A female elephant is called:""A,"" a mare; ""B,"" a doe;"
436,00:25:09.46,00:25:09.46,"or, ""C,"" a cow.Everybody reveal."
437,00:25:15.12,00:25:15.12,"Correct answer is ""C,"" the cow.Sugar got it right."
438,00:25:18.92,00:25:18.92,Susie got it right.Corinne got it right.
439,00:25:20.92,00:25:20.92,And Bob got it right.Next question.
440,00:25:24.50,00:25:24.50,It is a fact that the Gaboneseviper is a poisonous snake.
441,00:25:29.50,00:25:29.50,True or false: it is consideredvirtually harmless to humans.
442,00:25:34.92,00:25:34.92,Everybody reveal.Susie and Corinne say it is
443,00:25:39.58,00:25:39.58,true that it is virtuallyharmless to humans.
444,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,"A poisonous snake, Susie andCorinne, is deadly to humans."
445,00:25:46.83,00:25:46.83,"The answer is false.Yes, it was a trick question."
446,00:25:49.71,00:25:49.71,"Good news is, everybody'son the board."
447,00:25:51.38,00:25:51.38,Everybody's going to getat least one shot at the target.
448,00:25:54.08,00:25:54.08,Sugar currently in front withthree shots.
449,00:25:57.08,00:25:57.08,"Last question, true or false:the elephant's trunk has three"
450,00:26:01.33,00:26:01.33,"purposes: it serves as itsnose, its arm, and its mouth."

452,00:26:13.88,00:26:13.88,Susie says true.The trunk is the nose and the
453,00:26:17.04,00:26:17.04,arm.It is not the mouth.
454,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,Kenny got it right.Matty got it right.
455,00:26:20.50,00:26:20.50,Sugar got it right.Corinne got it right and Bob
456,00:26:22.79,00:26:22.79,"got it right.All right, well, we know what"
457,00:26:25.04,00:26:25.04,you know about Gabon.Let's see how it plays out.
458,00:26:27.67,00:26:27.67,"Head over here.Kenny, you're first up."
459,00:26:31.17,00:26:31.17,">> Good luck, Kenny.>> Let's do this."
460,00:26:34.38,00:26:34.38,>> PROBST: Kenny has two balls.Using your first one.
461,00:26:38.96,00:26:38.96,No hesitation.>> What?! Oh!
462,00:26:41.92,00:26:41.92,">> PROBST: Nice shot, sixthzone from the center."
463,00:26:44.54,00:26:44.54,"Matty, you're trying to get asclose as you can to that center"
464,00:26:47.88,00:26:47.88,zone.That looks good.
465,00:26:51.25,00:26:51.25,Fourth zone from the center.Matty is now the mark to beat.
466,00:26:55.08,00:26:55.08,"Sugar.Ooh, soft launch, going to look"
467,00:26:59.04,00:26:59.04,for some roll.She gets it.
468,00:27:01.96,00:27:01.96,"Not close enough.Matty, still the mark to beat."
469,00:27:05.54,00:27:05.54,"Susie, you get one shot.Don't be short, woman."
470,00:27:09.12,00:27:09.12,Come strong.Good launch.
471,00:27:13.04,00:27:13.04,Not going to be good enough.No shot at winning immunity.
472,00:27:17.42,00:27:17.42,"Corinne.Ooh, good-looking toss."
473,00:27:21.67,00:27:21.67,"Nobody.No, fifth zone from the middle."
474,00:27:25.12,00:27:25.12,Matty's still the mark to beat.Bob going to take his first
475,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,shot.>> It's all physics.
476,00:27:30.92,00:27:30.92,(laughter)>> PROBST: Good follow-through.
477,00:27:36.29,00:27:36.29,"Look at that.Bob, with his first toss,"
478,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,"is now the mark to beat.>> Good job, Bob."
479,00:27:41.42,00:27:41.42,>> Nice job.>> PROBST: Crystal got one
480,00:27:43.08,00:27:43.08,question right and gets only oneshot.
481,00:27:46.04,00:27:46.04,Crystal with no backspin.Gets a good roll.
482,00:27:50.04,00:27:50.04,Not good enough.Crystal's now out of the
483,00:27:51.88,00:27:51.88,challenge.Kenny.
484,00:27:54.71,00:27:54.71,"Kenny launches it.Oh, it was in, and then out."
485,00:27:59.96,00:27:59.96,">> Oh, Kenny!>> PROBST: Kenny is out of this"

489,00:28:12.42,00:28:12.42,Matty is now out of thischallenge.
490,00:28:14.42,00:28:14.42,No shot at winning.Sugar up next.
491,00:28:19.12,00:28:19.12,"Nice, little soft touch.Oh, just misses."
492,00:28:25.50,00:28:25.50,Not close enough.Corinne is up.
493,00:28:28.54,00:28:28.54,Big immunity on the line.Good toss.
494,00:28:34.12,00:28:34.12,Too far out.Bob's up.
495,00:28:37.50,00:28:37.50,He is already the mark to beat.He can afford to be a little
496,00:28:40.88,00:28:40.88,risky now.It's going to be short.
497,00:28:43.75,00:28:43.75,Will it roll?It does.
498,00:28:45.38,00:28:45.38,Bob improves his mark.He is now one zone from the
499,00:28:48.29,00:28:48.29,center.>> Wow!
500,00:28:49.71,00:28:49.71,>> PROBST: Going to be verytough to beat Bob.
501,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,"Sugar.Sugar going for the roll, and"
502,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"she won't get it.Bob, still the mark to beat."
503,00:29:02.00,00:29:02.00,"Corinne, your last shot atimmunity."
504,00:29:05.25,00:29:05.25,Goes very high.Will she get a good kick?
505,00:29:07.83,00:29:07.83,She does.Is it going to be enough? No.
506,00:29:09.96,00:29:09.96,(Corinne groans)Corinne has no shot at immunity.
507,00:29:13.21,00:29:13.21,"Bob, with your last ball.Bob doesn't improve his lie."
508,00:29:19.88,00:29:19.88,"Bob is still the mark to beat,though."
509,00:29:22.08,00:29:22.08,"One last shot.Sugar, this is it."
510,00:29:24.96,00:29:24.96,You need to get in either thecenter zone or the first zone
511,00:29:28.38,00:29:28.38,outside of the center.Anything else doesn't matter.
512,00:29:37.29,00:29:37.29,Sugar launches it.And a good roll.
513,00:29:39.92,00:29:39.92,It's in and out of the center.Bob wins immunity!
514,00:29:43.08,00:29:43.08,">> Good job, Bob.>> Handshake?"
515,00:29:46.29,00:29:46.29,">> PROBST: Bob, come on over.(applause)"
516,00:29:50.17,00:29:50.17,"Nice job.>> Thank you, sir."
517,00:29:52.33,00:29:52.33,>> PROBST: Bob is safeat tonight's Tribal Council.
518,00:29:54.42,00:29:54.42,Cannot be voted out of thisgame.
519,00:29:56.29,00:29:56.29,One-in-six shot at winning itall.
520,00:29:58.62,00:29:58.62,"For the rest of you, TribalCouncil tonight, where one of"
521,00:30:00.96,00:30:00.96,you will be voted out of thisgame.
522,00:30:03.08,00:30:03.08,Grab your stuff.Head back to camp.
523,00:30:04.50,00:30:04.50,I'll see you at Tribal.>> Winning today's immunity
524,00:30:06.58,00:30:06.58,challenge saved me.I'm going to get the fake idol
525,00:30:08.92,00:30:08.92,built.There are five Fang members
526,00:30:12.08,00:30:12.08,"here, and I'm going to suggestthat two of them go in with"
527,00:30:16.08,00:30:16.08,"Corinne and I.If all goes as planned, perfect"
528,00:30:19.92,00:30:19.92,"time to blindside Matty.>> Well done, Bob."
529,00:30:31.96,00:30:31.96,">> Yeah, very good.I felt like such a big dunce."
530,00:30:36.08,00:30:36.08,">> Obviously, Bob and I knowthat our numbers are up, so"
531,00:30:38.62,00:30:38.62,we've got this whole back storyabout why we have the idol that
532,00:30:41.21,00:30:41.21,was supposedly launched intothe ocean at the Fake Out Feast.
533,00:30:44.58,00:30:44.58,But what we needed to have thiswork correctly was at least one
534,00:30:48.08,00:30:48.08,"of us to get the immunity idol,which is exactly what happened."
535,00:30:52.58,00:30:52.58,The story is this: Marcus gotthe idol.
536,00:30:54.88,00:30:54.88,You were the only person thatknew about it.
537,00:30:56.71,00:30:56.71,I've never known about it.>> Right.
538,00:30:58.33,00:30:58.33,"If you hadn't gotten immunitytonight, you would have used it"
539,00:31:00.79,00:31:00.79,"for yourself.But you got immunity, and the"
540,00:31:02.75,00:31:02.75,only way to keep yourself inthis game is to give it to me
541,00:31:05.62,00:31:05.62,"so that I'm still in the game,and to take out the strongest"
542,00:31:08.21,00:31:08.21,"player, being Matty.If they think I'm going to play"
543,00:31:10.08,00:31:10.08,"the idol, they're not goingto want to vote me."
544,00:31:12.25,00:31:12.25,>> You are a conniving sonof a gun.
545,00:31:13.88,00:31:13.88,>> So are you.>> Thank you very much.
546,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,">> I hope this works.It's such a long shot, but it's"
547,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,all we got.Let's do it.
548,00:31:19.79,00:31:19.79,"I think I'm very smart, and Ithink Bob is very crafty."
549,00:31:22.17,00:31:22.17,And we put those two forcestogether.
550,00:31:24.17,00:31:24.17,This was the best we could do.It would be so awesome if this
551,00:31:27.79,00:31:27.79,"worked.>> The only thing, I think,"
552,00:31:35.29,00:31:35.29,Corinne's trying to make Bobgive her the immunity necklace.
553,00:31:37.58,00:31:37.58,">> Probably.>> If he gives it to her, it's"
554,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,"still before for the vote.So, we just... Bob's got to go."
555,00:31:43.71,00:31:43.71,">> Yeah, all we know is thisfive is tight and we're staying"
556,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,strong.And Corinne's gone.
557,00:31:49.21,00:31:49.21,"No one's flipping.No, we're good."
558,00:31:51.42,00:31:51.42,I don't know why everybody'sworried.
559,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,">> 'Cause this game makes youworry, man."
560,00:31:55.42,00:31:55.42,">> Bob, uh, won the immunitychallenge today."
561,00:31:58.08,00:31:58.08,"So, uh, today we need to voteout Corinne."
562,00:32:00.50,00:32:00.50,But it's dangerous.We're getting down to the final
563,00:32:02.92,00:32:02.92,"six with Bob still in it, andBob's a major threat when it"
564,00:32:05.71,00:32:05.71,"comes down to it, so... it'snerve-wracking, man."
565,00:32:20.58,00:32:20.58,>> You really can't sayanything.
566,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,>> I promise. I swear.>> So remember when they threw
567,00:32:24.42,00:32:24.42,the idol out into the ocean?>> Uh-huh.
568,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,">> Well, Marcus ripped thestring, but had the rest of the"
569,00:32:28.58,00:32:28.58,idol in his pocket.Never put it in the ocean.
570,00:32:30.75,00:32:30.75,He brought it back to camp andhid it with Bob.
571,00:32:33.12,00:32:33.12,"But since he won immunitytoday, he's like, ""Listen, if we"
572,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,"use it now, you know, it willhelp."""
573,00:32:37.33,00:32:37.33,>> Who are you guys goingto take out?
574,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,">> We're taking out Matty, andthat's it."
575,00:32:40.83,00:32:40.83,"So he may end up going home,but I know I'm not."
576,00:32:45.04,00:32:45.04,">> I think right now, yourand Bob's best chance is to"
577,00:32:47.58,00:32:47.58,take out Matty.>> Let me see if I can get Bob.
578,00:32:50.12,00:32:50.12,">> Yeah, I think you, me and Bobshould talk."
579,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,">> Well, he doesn't know I toldyou yet."
580,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"Let me, uh, soften the blow.Give me a second, Kenny."
581,00:32:56.79,00:32:56.79,">> This has definitely changedthe game, and I think the best"
582,00:32:59.96,00:32:59.96,shot is to blindside Mattyright now.
583,00:33:03.88,00:33:03.88,I think I might have to jumpalliances now.
584,00:33:08.04,00:33:08.04,"Oh, my God.>> Yeah."
585,00:33:13.88,00:33:13.88,>> So we're trying to figure outthe best way to strategize.
586,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,I don't know.>> I think the best option is...
587,00:33:19.17,00:33:19.17,">> Yeah, tell us, 'cause you'rejust as smart as we are,"
588,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,and we need your input.>> I know Matty's not that
589,00:33:23.17,00:33:23.17,smart.>> So I'm wondering...
590,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,>> Marcus took it off...>> Do you think maybe the better
591,00:33:31.29,00:33:31.29,"person 'cause she's smarterthan the rest of them, is"
592,00:33:33.38,00:33:33.38,Crystal?Do you think Crystal would
593,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,separate from the others?>> I think Crystal would
594,00:33:38.08,00:33:38.08,probably join us.>> So maybe...
595,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,">> And if we get Crystal in,we'll go to the final four."
596,00:33:43.75,00:33:43.75,>> Yup.>> And we'll figure it out
597,00:33:45.42,00:33:45.42,from there.>> Yeah.
598,00:33:46.67,00:33:46.67,We come up with a ridiculouslyharebrained scheme that
599,00:33:48.96,00:33:48.96,"shouldn't work at all, and itmight actually work, which is"
600,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,"so mind-blowing.It just shows you the level of,"
601,00:33:54.54,00:33:54.54,"like, incompetence we're playingwith."
602,00:34:09.04,00:34:09.04,>> What we're going to do isask Crystal if she'd like to be
603,00:34:12.96,00:34:12.96,on our alliance.And we're giving her the chance
604,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,to join with us.I just collected these pieces.
605,00:34:21.54,00:34:21.54,I'm worse than a raven.I save everything.
606,00:34:28.00,00:34:28.00,"I don't know about you, butthat would fool me."
607,00:34:31.92,00:34:31.92,(chittering)>> How close were you to Marcus
608,00:34:37.96,00:34:37.96,when he threw it in?>> We were far.
609,00:34:40.00,00:34:40.00,>> Yeah.You saw the idol that was
610,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,"on the bottle, right?>> Yeah."
611,00:34:46.58,00:34:46.58,>> It had a face on it.It was...
612,00:34:53.42,00:34:53.42,>> Right.>> That's the idol.
613,00:34:55.54,00:34:55.54,">> Final four: you, me, Kenny,and Corinne."
614,00:35:00.21,00:35:00.21,We don't want to use thistonight.
615,00:35:02.38,00:35:02.38,Would you be interested intaking out Matty tonight?
616,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,Go on board with us.>> I'm on board.
617,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,>> Operation Fake Idol II isworking like a charm.
618,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,And the interesting thing iswe're not even going to have
619,00:35:18.12,00:35:18.12,"to use the idol.>> Bob said ""Matty."""
620,00:35:21.58,00:35:21.58,>> We're taking out Matty?Even better for us.
621,00:35:26.62,00:35:26.62,">> Look, we have to flush outtheir idol."
622,00:35:28.50,00:35:28.50,>> Bob shook my hand and gaveme a kiss on the cheek.
623,00:35:31.46,00:35:31.46,>> What?>> So that's a big deal for him.
624,00:35:34.12,00:35:34.12,">> Okay, look, you have to votefor Corinne."
625,00:35:36.25,00:35:36.25,>> Okay.>> You understand that.
626,00:35:37.71,00:35:37.71,>> Yes.>> Everybody's voting for
627,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17,Corinne.>> Yes.
628,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,">> Okay, I'm going to vote forMatty."
629,00:35:42.25,00:35:42.25,>> That'll be three for Matty.>> Three for Matty.
630,00:35:44.12,00:35:44.12,">> And four for Corinne.>> Yeah, I'll make sure he plays"
631,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,"the idol, so the idol's gone,Matty's gone-- boom!"
632,00:35:50.38,00:35:50.38,This is the best plan.I know for a fact that Crystal
633,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,is going to vote for Corinne.And Corinne is going to play her
634,00:35:56.92,00:35:56.92,"idol, a win-win situation forme because the idol's flushed"
635,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,out and Matty's going to begoing home.
636,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,"So if this plan works out, oh,I'll be the biggest strategist"
637,00:36:07.67,00:36:07.67,in  Survivor  history.>> But it's going to be a little
638,00:36:10.67,00:36:10.67,tense there tonight.>> We'll have numbers out there
639,00:36:13.04,00:36:13.04,tonight anyways.I think it's a good plan.
640,00:36:15.88,00:36:15.88,>> Yeah.>> I think it's the best...
641,00:36:18.25,00:36:18.25,>> I think the four of us...It's going to be my first flop
642,00:36:21.50,00:36:21.50,"in the game, but hopefully, it'sa good choice."
643,00:36:24.58,00:36:24.58,>> Every fiber of me wantsto trust Kenny.
644,00:36:26.96,00:36:26.96,"If the idol is real, thenMatty's gone."
645,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67,"But if they got a fake idol,Corinne goes home, and I've"
646,00:36:33.12,00:36:33.12,definitely been weighing who'sbetter to take out.
647,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,My heart tells me to take Mattyout.
648,00:36:38.12,00:36:38.12,"Corinne is not the threat to mein no way, shape or form."
649,00:36:40.75,00:36:40.75,"This is, like, my only chanceto get him out, and it's been"
650,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,wracking my brain.The mental part of this game is
651,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,kicking my ass.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
652,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,"the members of our jury.Marcus, Charlie, and Randy,"
653,00:37:17.29,00:37:17.29,voted out at the last TribalCouncil.

658,00:37:35.62,00:37:35.62,effect.So you do have to think ahead.
659,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,">> PROBST: Bob, does this makesense, this paranoia?"
660,00:37:43.62,00:37:43.62,Is that inevitable?>> This is the first time I
661,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,haven't been paranoid.I get to realize what it feels
662,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,like to have this on.But I'll be paranoid next time
663,00:37:52.46,00:37:52.46,"I come in here.>> PROBST: Corinne, can"
664,00:37:54.79,00:37:54.79,paranoia be an advantage?>> I suppose it can.
665,00:37:57.54,00:37:57.54,"You know, obviously, Bob and Iare kind of on the outside, and"
666,00:38:00.29,00:38:00.29,"they're a tight group of five.If paranoia sets in, maybe"
667,00:38:03.96,00:38:03.96,"there is a possibility to tryand, you know, break it up."
668,00:38:09.29,00:38:09.29,">> PROBST: Sugar, what's theworst part about paranoia as it"
669,00:38:12.46,00:38:12.46,relates to your game?>> People freaking out and

671,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,keep everybody in check andmake sure nobody is being

675,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,>> PROBST: And is the wholetrick of this game figuring out
676,00:38:37.25,00:38:37.25,when that time is?>> That is the whole trick of
677,00:38:41.08,00:38:41.08,the game: knowing when to trustand when to cut your ties.
678,00:38:47.08,00:38:47.08,">> PROBST: Kenny, is tonight'svote any more important, less"
679,00:38:50.29,00:38:50.29,important than any other vote?>> I think it's very important
680,00:38:54.25,00:38:54.25,tonight.Because you think that you can
681,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,"trust somebody, and then youdon't."
682,00:38:58.29,00:38:58.29,"Because after you see thevotes, you're going to be like,"

684,00:39:02.38,00:39:02.38,"So I would say tonight's vote isvery important, compared to any"

690,00:39:16.54,00:39:16.54,"It is time to vote.Corinne, you're up."
691,00:39:38.62,00:39:38.62,">> Matty, this is clearlya strategic move, and I'm sorry"
