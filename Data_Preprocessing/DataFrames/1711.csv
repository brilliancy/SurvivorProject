2,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,"Survivor: On day 22, Marcus, the leader"
3,00:00:06.21,00:00:06.21,"of the Kota alliance, was so confident, he was able to throw"
4,00:00:10.25,00:00:10.25,away a hidden immunity idol. >> These people are so stupid.
5,00:00:14.12,00:00:14.12,I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean.
6,00:00:18.08,00:00:18.08,">> That is a very prized possession there this game,"
7,00:00:21.08,00:00:21.08,and somebody is really going to wish they had that in a few
8,00:00:24.04,00:00:24.04,days. >> PROBST: But the days of Kota
9,00:00:26.17,00:00:26.17,"dominance were coming to an end. By using brilliant strategy,"
10,00:00:30.29,00:00:30.29,"a rival alliance led by Kenny... >> Behind the scenes, I'm really"
11,00:00:33.25,00:00:33.25,calling the shots. >> PROBST: ...has systematically
12,00:00:36.04,00:00:36.04,dismantled their foes. They even tricked Randy into
13,00:00:39.25,00:00:39.25,playing a fake idol. This is not a hidden immunity
14,00:00:43.88,00:00:43.88,idol. (Sugar laughing)
15,00:00:47.04,00:00:47.04,Sending him home and humiliating him at the same time.
16,00:00:50.25,00:00:50.25,">> It wasn't just ""ha, ha, ha."" It was on and on and on."
17,00:00:54.46,00:00:54.46,"(Sugar laughing) And I was, to say the least,"
18,00:00:57.04,00:00:57.04,"irritated. >> PROBST: Can Bob and Corinne,"
19,00:00:59.12,00:00:59.12,"the two remaining Kota, come up with a brilliant strategy of"
20,00:01:02.12,00:01:02.12,their own to stay in the game? Seven are left.

24,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,">> Yeah. >> The best Tribal so far, for"
25,00:01:22.25,00:01:22.25,sure. >> I think it was.
26,00:01:24.17,00:01:24.17,">> Bob, was that was your idea to give Randy that fake idol?"
27,00:01:28.04,00:01:28.04,">> Don't laugh like that. You know, that pisses me off,"
28,00:01:31.04,00:01:31.04,that part of sticking it in his face.
29,00:01:34.33,00:01:34.33,"I didn't mind doing the thing, but then to just belittle him"
30,00:01:37.75,00:01:37.75,as he was going out pisses me off.
31,00:01:39.88,00:01:39.88,">> I'm sorry, Bob. >> I'm over it now, but don't"
32,00:01:41.75,00:01:41.75,ever do that again. >> I really am sorry.
33,00:01:44.25,00:01:44.25,I know you feel bad. I'm sorry.
34,00:01:47.58,00:01:47.58,"I don't feel one iota, a bit sorry for Randy because he dug"
35,00:01:52.25,00:01:52.25,"his own grave, and it's hilarious that somebody gave"
36,00:01:56.04,00:01:56.04,him a fake idol and he played it.
37,00:01:59.21,00:01:59.21,">> For all the lessons you got to teach me, right, about not"
38,00:02:01.62,00:02:01.62,"talking-- not belittling people. >> Corinne, you talk about"
39,00:02:04.62,00:02:04.62,"people all the time behind their back, and then to their face,"
40,00:02:07.21,00:02:07.21,"you act like a really sweet, little girl with a little bow"
41,00:02:09.96,00:02:09.96,on your head. Come on.
42,00:02:11.25,00:02:11.25,>> I'm not acting like a sweet girl.
43,00:02:13.12,00:02:13.12,If I told everybody to their face what I said behind their
44,00:02:15.42,00:02:15.42,"back, I wouldn't be playing a very good game, would I?"
45,00:02:17.71,00:02:17.71,">> Well, you shouldn't be talking about people behind"
46,00:02:19.29,00:02:19.29,their back that you don't even know.
47,00:02:21.21,00:02:21.21,>> Why not? It's  Survivor. You don't come here to make
48,00:02:23.08,00:02:23.08,friends. You come here to play the game.
49,00:02:24.79,00:02:24.79,"You said it yourself. >> Right, exactly."
50,00:02:26.21,00:02:26.21,"You hit the nail on the head, Corinne."
51,00:02:28.12,00:02:28.12,"We're here to play the game, and we're playing the game."
52,00:02:30.21,00:02:30.21,">> I am... In general, I'm a nice person"
53,00:02:33.25,00:02:33.25,"to people I like. I am now in a camp of mutants,"
54,00:02:36.75,00:02:36.75,"none of whom I like, so it's very difficult for me to pretend"
55,00:02:39.33,00:02:39.33,to be nice to them. That's not something I'm used
56,00:02:41.42,00:02:41.42,"to, and that's done. (chewing loudly)"
57,00:02:55.79,00:02:55.79,(elephant trumpets) >> Oh!
58,00:03:10.17,00:03:10.17,">> Careful of them, careful. >> Oh..."
59,00:03:14.71,00:03:14.71,>> And look at this guy. Look at this guy.
60,00:03:16.83,00:03:16.83,">> Oh, my... Look how..."
61,00:03:18.42,00:03:18.42,"Ah, he's heavy. I would never have imagined me"
62,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17,being out here and catching fish.
63,00:03:23.62,00:03:23.62,I'm not an outdoorsy types of person.
64,00:03:26.04,00:03:26.04,"I'm just a gamer at home, but out here, I'm my own man."
65,00:03:29.83,00:03:29.83,"So I am very proud of myself, because guys like me would"
66,00:03:33.04,00:03:33.04,"never ever be out here in a situation like this, but only"
67,00:03:36.71,00:03:36.71,"in the game of  Survivor. >> We're going to eat today,"
68,00:03:39.04,00:03:39.04,"you people! >> That is huge, Bob."
69,00:03:40.88,00:03:40.88,>> That's the biggest fish I think I've ever seen anybody
70,00:03:43.46,00:03:43.46,catch. >> That thing is huge.
71,00:03:45.25,00:03:45.25,"Wow, that looks like a mini shark."
72,00:03:47.25,00:03:47.25,">> This is crazy. I've been able to catch tilapia,"
73,00:03:49.62,00:03:49.62,turtle and big catfishes. >> Yeah!
74,00:03:52.12,00:03:52.12,>> This is weird. >> And little catfishes.
75,00:03:53.29,00:03:53.29,>> And little baby ones and crawfish.
76,00:03:55.21,00:03:55.21,It's kind of weird. >> There you go. That way.
77,00:03:58.46,00:03:58.46,>> Yeah. >> Bob doesn't look out for
78,00:04:05.46,00:04:05.46,himself. He doesn't know how to play this
79,00:04:07.21,00:04:07.21,"game at all. He's just here to build things,"
80,00:04:09.08,00:04:09.08,"and that's stupid, you know? You know, he's taught me a lot"
81,00:04:12.25,00:04:12.25,"out here, but as far as playing the game, he's not very good"
82,00:04:14.83,00:04:14.83,"at it. >> Good job, Bob."
83,00:04:16.25,00:04:16.25,>> So I don't mind getting rid of Bob.
84,00:04:18.12,00:04:18.12,And I feel like I need to pull the power into my own hands and
85,00:04:21.21,00:04:21.21,"take charge. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
86,00:04:33.17,00:04:33.17,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa You guys ready to get to today's
87,00:04:38.71,00:04:38.71,challenge? >> Yeah.

89,00:04:41.29,00:04:41.29,"challenge, you will divide into two teams of three."
90,00:04:44.21,00:04:44.21,"On my go, you will race out into the swamp, where you will"
91,00:04:47.04,00:04:47.04,find two stations of sprocket-shaped puzzle pieces.
92,00:04:50.88,00:04:50.88,"Once you've collected all seven pieces, you must then arrange"
93,00:04:53.79,00:04:53.79,the pieces so they work together allowing to you raise
94,00:04:56.88,00:04:56.88,the flag. The first team of three to raise
95,00:04:59.38,00:04:59.38,"their flag moves on to the final round, where you will square off"
96,00:05:03.04,00:05:03.04,against each other to solve a slide puzzle.
97,00:05:07.00,00:05:07.00,The first person to solve the slide puzzle wins reward.
98,00:05:10.17,00:05:10.17,Want to know what you're playing for?
99,00:05:12.04,00:05:12.04,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: 31 days is a long
100,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,time to be without love. I wish I could tell you
101,00:05:19.00,00:05:19.00,"your loved ones were here, coming around the corner."
102,00:05:22.04,00:05:22.04,They're not. But that doesn't mean you can't
103,00:05:25.17,00:05:25.17,have a little love right now. I have a Samsung Instinct
104,00:05:29.58,00:05:29.58,by Sprint. Loaded onto this phone are video
105,00:05:32.62,00:05:32.62,messages from your loved ones at home.
106,00:05:35.67,00:05:35.67,I'm going to give you a little taste of that love right now.
107,00:05:42.79,00:05:42.79,"Here's Andre and Destiny. >> Hi, Crystal, this is Dre,"
108,00:05:46.79,00:05:46.79,"your big, old boo. Just want you to know that"
109,00:05:48.88,00:05:48.88,everything is going well here on the home front.
110,00:05:51.21,00:05:51.21,">> Hi, Mommy, this is Destiny. I love you. Be safe."
111,00:05:54.62,00:05:54.62,">> Oh, thank you. I needed that."
112,00:05:57.79,00:05:57.79,">> PROBST: All right, Kenny, you ready for a little love?"
113,00:06:00.00,00:06:00.00,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Kenny, here's your"
114,00:06:02.04,00:06:02.04,"sister, Jenny. >> Hey, Ken, it's Jenny."
115,00:06:05.17,00:06:05.17,"Uh, I love you so much. I miss you."
116,00:06:08.08,00:06:08.08,"Do your best, and never give up. (sniffling)"
117,00:06:12.58,00:06:12.58,>> I can't believe I'm crying. >> PROBST: Why?
118,00:06:15.79,00:06:15.79,>> I miss her. I miss her.
119,00:06:17.21,00:06:17.21,"I miss family. I mean, it's been rough."
120,00:06:20.21,00:06:20.21,">> PROBST: You guys can crowd around, too, if you want to see"
121,00:06:22.54,00:06:22.54,"each other's. >> Oh, you guys get to see"
122,00:06:24.88,00:06:24.88,"my baby, I hope. >> PROBST: All right, Susie."
123,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,"Here's your husband. >> Hey, hon, we miss you"
124,00:06:29.04,00:06:29.04,something terrible. >> We miss you a lot.
125,00:06:30.50,00:06:30.50,">> Look at my baby. >> Oh, it's terrible how bad it"
126,00:06:32.38,00:06:32.38,is around here without you being here.
127,00:06:34.00,00:06:34.00,The house is way too quiet. >> Aw...
128,00:06:35.79,00:06:35.79,">> PROBST: Your man and your son, your two men."
129,00:06:37.42,00:06:37.42,>> That's my baby. That's my man!
130,00:06:38.88,00:06:38.88,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, Corinne."
131,00:06:42.58,00:06:42.58,">> Hi, Corinne. We miss you."
132,00:06:44.92,00:06:44.92,"Hey, sis. Uh, hope you're doing good out"
133,00:06:47.17,00:06:47.17,there. Kind of miss you over here.
134,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,I've got no one to talk to when I've got something crazy
135,00:06:51.62,00:06:51.62,to tell someone. >> PROBST: You got the whole
136,00:06:53.88,00:06:53.88,family and the brother. >> Wow.
137,00:06:55.79,00:06:55.79,">> PROBST: All right, Bob. Here's Peggy."
138,00:06:58.79,00:06:58.79,">> Hi, Bob. How're you doing?"
139,00:07:00.92,00:07:00.92,I hope that you're doing really well.
140,00:07:03.38,00:07:03.38,What I mostly hope is that you're having the adventure
141,00:07:05.58,00:07:05.58,of your lifetime. >> She's pretty.
142,00:07:07.88,00:07:07.88,">> Oh, yeah. Yeah. >> PROBST: Now, that's support."
143,00:07:10.17,00:07:10.17,"All she said was, ""I just hope you're having the adventure"
144,00:07:12.79,00:07:12.79,"of a lifetime."" >> Yeah."
145,00:07:14.04,00:07:14.04,She's behind me a hundred percent.
146,00:07:15.92,00:07:15.92,I'm the luckiest man in the world.
147,00:07:17.67,00:07:17.67,">> PROBST: Aw. Matty, you look anxious."
148,00:07:20.96,00:07:20.96,>> Oh... >> PROBST: You want to go next?
149,00:07:22.83,00:07:22.83,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right.
150,00:07:24.25,00:07:24.25,Who do you want to hear from? >> Jamie.
151,00:07:26.12,00:07:26.12,">> PROBST: All right. >> Hi, baby."
152,00:07:28.46,00:07:28.46,How are you doing? We're happy as can be.
153,00:07:31.08,00:07:31.08,"Yet, we do miss our other partner, our family member,"
154,00:07:34.38,00:07:34.38,Matty. And don't ever forget that we
155,00:07:36.92,00:07:36.92,love you. And we'll be here when you
156,00:07:38.88,00:07:38.88,return. I love you so much.

162,00:07:55.21,00:07:55.21,"You have us supporting you all the way, but especially Dad,"
163,00:07:58.92,00:07:58.92,who's smiling down at you from above.
164,00:08:01.25,00:08:01.25,And remember that we love you so much.
165,00:08:06.38,00:08:06.38,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Pretty nice message.
166,00:08:08.75,00:08:08.75,>> It's really nice to see her and hear that from her.
167,00:08:13.58,00:08:13.58,">> PROBST: All right, guys. Thanks for sharing those"
168,00:08:15.38,00:08:15.38,"with me. All right, so, the winner of"

171,00:08:29.46,00:08:29.46,"little afternoon of pizza, beer, brownies..."
172,00:08:33.67,00:08:33.67,You'll fill up your belly and you will fill up your heart.
173,00:08:36.67,00:08:36.67,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
174,00:08:38.42,00:08:38.42,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: One more thing,"
175,00:08:40.04,00:08:40.04,"because today is all about love, nobody is going to Exile"
176,00:08:43.17,00:08:43.17,"Island. All right, we're going to draw"
177,00:08:45.17,00:08:45.17,for teams. Take a stone.
178,00:08:47.83,00:08:47.83,"Please don't look. Come on, now, keep it covered."
179,00:09:00.88,00:09:00.88,"All right, everybody, palms out and reveal."
180,00:09:03.12,00:09:03.12,"If you have a yellow or red, you're a captain."
181,00:09:05.58,00:09:05.58,Take a spot over here. Crystal and Susie.
182,00:09:10.25,00:09:10.25,"All right, we're going to rock, paper, scissors-- see who goes"
183,00:09:13.12,00:09:13.12,"first. >> One, two, three."
184,00:09:16.50,00:09:16.50,>> Scissors. >> PROBST: Scissors cuts paper.
185,00:09:18.12,00:09:18.12,"Susie, you choose first. Who do you want on your team?"
186,00:09:20.04,00:09:20.04,">> Matty. >> PROBST: Crystal, who do you"
187,00:09:21.92,00:09:21.92,want? Sugar.
188,00:09:24.29,00:09:24.29,>> PROBST: Matty's choice. >> Kenny.

344,00:19:13.96,00:19:13.96,And that's what I realized out here.
345,00:19:15.88,00:19:15.88,I got to face up to my fears and grow up.
346,00:19:19.08,00:19:19.08,And I don't want to let another day pass and me not let Jamie

377,00:21:09.00,00:21:09.00,"you will find it. >> Hey, two peeps."
378,00:21:31.62,00:21:31.62,Who wants to get tree mail? >> I'll go.
379,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50,">> Corinne, go get tree mail. >> I'll go with Corinne."
380,00:21:35.62,00:21:35.62,">> Yeah, go. >> All right."
381,00:21:37.04,00:21:37.04,>> Get going. >> You guys want to go.
382,00:21:38.67,00:21:38.67,"Have fun. >> Okay, we'll be right back."
383,00:21:40.29,00:21:40.29,">> Bye. >> You know, there is a"
384,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"possibility, very slight, that they might get rid of Matty"
385,00:21:55.58,00:21:55.58,if he doesn't win immunity. >> Here's what I'm thinking...
386,00:21:58.29,00:21:58.29,">> You guys, don't you think it's weird that there's a tribe"
387,00:22:00.71,00:22:00.71,of people are living together and a couple that of them know
388,00:22:03.08,00:22:03.08,they're going? It's so weird.
389,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,">> They're outside, outskirts. >> As for now, our five are"
390,00:22:07.12,00:22:07.12,sticking together because we have a better chance that way.
391,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17,"Hopefully, nobody's going to flip."
392,00:22:16.08,00:22:16.08,>> He's good at everything. You're the only person that
393,00:22:18.17,00:22:18.17,"stands a chance against Bob in a physical challenge, really."
394,00:22:20.88,00:22:20.88,">> Yeah. >> That's true, Matty."
395,00:22:22.79,00:22:22.79,>> The plan is to vote out Bob and then Corinne because Bob is
396,00:22:26.29,00:22:26.29,way bigger of a threat. >> Remember when we threw the
397,00:22:36.08,00:22:36.08,idol into the ocean? >> Yes.
398,00:22:38.21,00:22:38.21,>> And they never went and checked the bottle.
399,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,But Marcus threw it in. Did you know that he had the
400,00:22:45.46,00:22:45.46,idol in his pocket when he came back and hid it around camp?
401,00:22:49.08,00:22:49.08,"And showed me where it was. And said, ""It's hidden over"
402,00:22:52.08,00:22:52.08,"here."" >> No way."
403,00:22:53.50,00:22:53.50,"He didn't have it when he went to Tribal, so if I win immunity,"
404,00:22:57.12,00:22:57.12,I can give that to you. >> That's a legit idol?
405,00:23:00.12,00:23:00.12,">> No, but it sounded pretty good, didn't it?"
406,00:23:02.00,00:23:02.00,">> Oh. Yeah, it did sound good. >> I'm going to put it together,"
407,00:23:07.12,00:23:07.12,and I'm going to imply that I've got the idol we were supposed
408,00:23:11.04,00:23:11.04,to have thrown in the ocean. >> Wow.
409,00:23:13.21,00:23:13.21,>> I am going to make my second very good fake idol of the game.
410,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,"And the plan with the idol is, I'm going to tell somebody on"
411,00:23:21.67,00:23:21.67,the other side that I've got the the original idol that was
412,00:23:25.29,00:23:25.29,"supposed to have gone into the ocean, so they've got to be"
413,00:23:28.21,00:23:28.21,"careful how they vote. >> Good for you, Bob."
414,00:23:35.08,00:23:35.08,"Good plan. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
415,00:23:47.33,00:23:47.33,You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
416,00:23:49.71,00:23:49.71,>> You got it. >> Yes.
417,00:23:51.12,00:23:51.12,">> PROBST: First things first-- Kenny, give it up."
418,00:23:54.29,00:23:54.29,"(laughs) Once again, immunity is back up"
419,00:23:57.50,00:23:57.50,"for grabs. For today's challenge, I'm"
420,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,going to ask you questions about Gabon.
421,00:24:02.46,00:24:02.46,"Each time you answer correctly, you earn a ball."
422,00:24:05.50,00:24:05.50,You're then going to take turns throwing your balls toward
423,00:24:08.71,00:24:08.71,a target divided by zones. The person who lands their ball
424,00:24:12.54,00:24:12.54,"in a zone closest to the center wins immunity, guaranteed a"
425,00:24:16.42,00:24:16.42,one-in-six shot at winning this game.
426,00:24:21.12,00:24:21.12,Losers go to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted
427,00:24:23.21,00:24:23.21,out. Anything not clear?
428,00:24:25.54,00:24:25.54,"Let's get started. All right, here we go."
429,00:24:29.08,00:24:29.08,"First question, true or false: gorillas were actually first"
430,00:24:33.08,00:24:33.08,"discovered here in Gabon? All right, everybody, reveal."
431,00:24:45.29,00:24:45.29,Correct answer is... true.
432,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,Sugar got it right. Corinne got it right.
433,00:24:50.96,00:24:50.96,Gorillas were discovered here in 1847.
434,00:24:54.83,00:24:54.83,Sugar gets a ball. Corinne gets a ball.
435,00:24:58.08,00:24:58.08,Next question: a male elephant is called a bull.
436,00:25:03.00,00:25:03.00,"A female elephant is called: ""A,"" a mare; ""B,"" a doe;"
437,00:25:09.46,00:25:09.46,"or, ""C,"" a cow. Everybody reveal."
438,00:25:15.12,00:25:15.12,"Correct answer is ""C,"" the cow. Sugar got it right."
439,00:25:18.92,00:25:18.92,Susie got it right. Corinne got it right.
440,00:25:20.92,00:25:20.92,And Bob got it right. Next question.
441,00:25:24.50,00:25:24.50,It is a fact that the Gabonese viper is a poisonous snake.
442,00:25:29.50,00:25:29.50,True or false: it is considered virtually harmless to humans.
443,00:25:34.92,00:25:34.92,Everybody reveal. Susie and Corinne say it is
444,00:25:39.58,00:25:39.58,true that it is virtually harmless to humans.
445,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,"A poisonous snake, Susie and Corinne, is deadly to humans."
446,00:25:46.83,00:25:46.83,"The answer is false. Yes, it was a trick question."
447,00:25:49.71,00:25:49.71,"Good news is, everybody's on the board."
448,00:25:51.38,00:25:51.38,Everybody's going to get at least one shot at the target.
449,00:25:54.08,00:25:54.08,Sugar currently in front with three shots.
450,00:25:57.08,00:25:57.08,"Last question, true or false: the elephant's trunk has three"
451,00:26:01.33,00:26:01.33,"purposes: it serves as its nose, its arm, and its mouth."
452,00:26:08.79,00:26:08.79,Everybody reveal. Crystal says true.
453,00:26:13.88,00:26:13.88,Susie says true. The trunk is the nose and the
454,00:26:17.04,00:26:17.04,arm. It is not the mouth.
455,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,Kenny got it right. Matty got it right.
456,00:26:20.50,00:26:20.50,Sugar got it right. Corinne got it right and Bob
457,00:26:22.79,00:26:22.79,"got it right. All right, well, we know what"
458,00:26:25.04,00:26:25.04,you know about Gabon. Let's see how it plays out.
459,00:26:27.67,00:26:27.67,"Head over here. Kenny, you're first up."
460,00:26:31.17,00:26:31.17,">> Good luck, Kenny. >> Let's do this."
461,00:26:34.38,00:26:34.38,>> PROBST: Kenny has two balls. Using your first one.
462,00:26:38.96,00:26:38.96,No hesitation. >> What?! Oh!
463,00:26:41.92,00:26:41.92,">> PROBST: Nice shot, sixth zone from the center."
464,00:26:44.54,00:26:44.54,"Matty, you're trying to get as close as you can to that center"
465,00:26:47.88,00:26:47.88,zone. That looks good.
466,00:26:51.25,00:26:51.25,Fourth zone from the center. Matty is now the mark to beat.
467,00:26:55.08,00:26:55.08,"Sugar. Ooh, soft launch, going to look"
468,00:26:59.04,00:26:59.04,for some roll. She gets it.
469,00:27:01.96,00:27:01.96,"Not close enough. Matty, still the mark to beat."
470,00:27:05.54,00:27:05.54,"Susie, you get one shot. Don't be short, woman."
471,00:27:09.12,00:27:09.12,Come strong. Good launch.
472,00:27:13.04,00:27:13.04,Not going to be good enough. No shot at winning immunity.
473,00:27:17.42,00:27:17.42,"Corinne. Ooh, good-looking toss."
474,00:27:21.67,00:27:21.67,"Nobody. No, fifth zone from the middle."
475,00:27:25.12,00:27:25.12,Matty's still the mark to beat. Bob going to take his first
476,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,shot. >> It's all physics.
477,00:27:30.92,00:27:30.92,(laughter) >> PROBST: Good follow-through.
478,00:27:36.29,00:27:36.29,"Look at that. Bob, with his first toss,"
479,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,"is now the mark to beat. >> Good job, Bob."
480,00:27:41.42,00:27:41.42,>> Nice job. >> PROBST: Crystal got one
481,00:27:43.08,00:27:43.08,question right and gets only one shot.
482,00:27:46.04,00:27:46.04,Crystal with no backspin. Gets a good roll.
483,00:27:50.04,00:27:50.04,Not good enough. Crystal's now out of the
484,00:27:51.88,00:27:51.88,challenge. Kenny.
485,00:27:54.71,00:27:54.71,"Kenny launches it. Oh, it was in, and then out."
486,00:27:59.96,00:27:59.96,">> Oh, Kenny! >> PROBST: Kenny is out of this"
487,00:28:01.71,00:28:01.71,challenge now. Matty with his last shot at
488,00:28:04.29,00:28:04.29,"this. >> No, Matt."
489,00:28:10.62,00:28:10.62,">> PROBST: Nope, Matty falls short."
490,00:28:12.42,00:28:12.42,Matty is now out of this challenge.
491,00:28:14.42,00:28:14.42,No shot at winning. Sugar up next.
492,00:28:19.12,00:28:19.12,"Nice, little soft touch. Oh, just misses."
493,00:28:25.50,00:28:25.50,Not close enough. Corinne is up.
494,00:28:28.54,00:28:28.54,Big immunity on the line. Good toss.
495,00:28:34.12,00:28:34.12,Too far out. Bob's up.
496,00:28:37.50,00:28:37.50,He is already the mark to beat. He can afford to be a little
497,00:28:40.88,00:28:40.88,risky now. It's going to be short.
498,00:28:43.75,00:28:43.75,Will it roll? It does.
499,00:28:45.38,00:28:45.38,Bob improves his mark. He is now one zone from the
500,00:28:48.29,00:28:48.29,center. >> Wow!
501,00:28:49.71,00:28:49.71,>> PROBST: Going to be very tough to beat Bob.
502,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,"Sugar. Sugar going for the roll, and"
503,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"she won't get it. Bob, still the mark to beat."
504,00:29:02.00,00:29:02.00,"Corinne, your last shot at immunity."
505,00:29:05.25,00:29:05.25,Goes very high. Will she get a good kick?
506,00:29:07.83,00:29:07.83,She does. Is it going to be enough? No.
507,00:29:09.96,00:29:09.96,(Corinne groans) Corinne has no shot at immunity.
508,00:29:13.21,00:29:13.21,"Bob, with your last ball. Bob doesn't improve his lie."
509,00:29:19.88,00:29:19.88,"Bob is still the mark to beat, though."
510,00:29:22.08,00:29:22.08,"One last shot. Sugar, this is it."
511,00:29:24.96,00:29:24.96,You need to get in either the center zone or the first zone
512,00:29:28.38,00:29:28.38,outside of the center. Anything else doesn't matter.
513,00:29:37.29,00:29:37.29,Sugar launches it. And a good roll.
514,00:29:39.92,00:29:39.92,It's in and out of the center. Bob wins immunity!
515,00:29:43.08,00:29:43.08,">> Good job, Bob. >> Handshake?"
516,00:29:46.29,00:29:46.29,">> PROBST: Bob, come on over. (applause)"
517,00:29:50.17,00:29:50.17,"Nice job. >> Thank you, sir."
518,00:29:52.33,00:29:52.33,>> PROBST: Bob is safe at tonight's Tribal Council.
519,00:29:54.42,00:29:54.42,Cannot be voted out of this game.
520,00:29:56.29,00:29:56.29,One-in-six shot at winning it all.
521,00:29:58.62,00:29:58.62,"For the rest of you, Tribal Council tonight, where one of"
522,00:30:00.96,00:30:00.96,you will be voted out of this game.
523,00:30:03.08,00:30:03.08,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
524,00:30:04.50,00:30:04.50,I'll see you at Tribal. >> Winning today's immunity
525,00:30:06.58,00:30:06.58,challenge saved me. I'm going to get the fake idol
526,00:30:08.92,00:30:08.92,built. There are five Fang members
527,00:30:12.08,00:30:12.08,"here, and I'm going to suggest that two of them go in with"
528,00:30:16.08,00:30:16.08,"Corinne and I. If all goes as planned, perfect"
529,00:30:19.92,00:30:19.92,"time to blindside Matty. >> Well done, Bob."
530,00:30:31.96,00:30:31.96,">> Yeah, very good. I felt like such a big dunce."
531,00:30:36.08,00:30:36.08,">> Obviously, Bob and I know that our numbers are up, so"
532,00:30:38.62,00:30:38.62,we've got this whole back story about why we have the idol that
533,00:30:41.21,00:30:41.21,was supposedly launched into the ocean at the Fake Out Feast.
534,00:30:44.58,00:30:44.58,But what we needed to have this work correctly was at least one
535,00:30:48.08,00:30:48.08,"of us to get the immunity idol, which is exactly what happened."
536,00:30:52.58,00:30:52.58,The story is this: Marcus got the idol.
537,00:30:54.88,00:30:54.88,You were the only person that knew about it.
538,00:30:56.71,00:30:56.71,I've never known about it. >> Right.
539,00:30:58.33,00:30:58.33,"If you hadn't gotten immunity tonight, you would have used it"
540,00:31:00.79,00:31:00.79,"for yourself. But you got immunity, and the"
541,00:31:02.75,00:31:02.75,only way to keep yourself in this game is to give it to me
542,00:31:05.62,00:31:05.62,"so that I'm still in the game, and to take out the strongest"
543,00:31:08.21,00:31:08.21,"player, being Matty. If they think I'm going to play"
544,00:31:10.08,00:31:10.08,"the idol, they're not going to want to vote me."
545,00:31:12.25,00:31:12.25,>> You are a conniving son of a gun.
546,00:31:13.88,00:31:13.88,>> So are you. >> Thank you very much.
547,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,">> I hope this works. It's such a long shot, but it's"
548,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,all we got. Let's do it.
549,00:31:19.79,00:31:19.79,"I think I'm very smart, and I think Bob is very crafty."
550,00:31:22.17,00:31:22.17,And we put those two forces together.
551,00:31:24.17,00:31:24.17,This was the best we could do. It would be so awesome if this
552,00:31:27.79,00:31:27.79,"worked. >> The only thing, I think,"
553,00:31:35.29,00:31:35.29,Corinne's trying to make Bob give her the immunity necklace.
554,00:31:37.58,00:31:37.58,">> Probably. >> If he gives it to her, it's"
555,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,"still before for the vote. So, we just... Bob's got to go."
556,00:31:43.71,00:31:43.71,">> Yeah, all we know is this five is tight and we're staying"
557,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,strong. And Corinne's gone.
558,00:31:49.21,00:31:49.21,"No one's flipping. No, we're good."
559,00:31:51.42,00:31:51.42,I don't know why everybody's worried.
560,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,">> 'Cause this game makes you worry, man."
561,00:31:55.42,00:31:55.42,">> Bob, uh, won the immunity challenge today."
562,00:31:58.08,00:31:58.08,"So, uh, today we need to vote out Corinne."
563,00:32:00.50,00:32:00.50,But it's dangerous. We're getting down to the final
564,00:32:02.92,00:32:02.92,"six with Bob still in it, and Bob's a major threat when it"
565,00:32:05.71,00:32:05.71,"comes down to it, so... it's nerve-wracking, man."
566,00:32:20.58,00:32:20.58,>> You really can't say anything.
567,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,>> I promise. I swear. >> So remember when they threw
568,00:32:24.42,00:32:24.42,the idol out into the ocean? >> Uh-huh.
569,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,">> Well, Marcus ripped the string, but had the rest of the"
570,00:32:28.58,00:32:28.58,idol in his pocket. Never put it in the ocean.
571,00:32:30.75,00:32:30.75,He brought it back to camp and hid it with Bob.
572,00:32:33.12,00:32:33.12,"But since he won immunity today, he's like, ""Listen, if we"
573,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,"use it now, you know, it will help."""
574,00:32:37.33,00:32:37.33,>> Who are you guys going to take out?
575,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,">> We're taking out Matty, and that's it."
576,00:32:40.83,00:32:40.83,"So he may end up going home, but I know I'm not."
577,00:32:45.04,00:32:45.04,">> I think right now, your and Bob's best chance is to"
578,00:32:47.58,00:32:47.58,take out Matty. >> Let me see if I can get Bob.
579,00:32:50.12,00:32:50.12,">> Yeah, I think you, me and Bob should talk."
580,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,">> Well, he doesn't know I told you yet."
581,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"Let me, uh, soften the blow. Give me a second, Kenny."
582,00:32:56.79,00:32:56.79,">> This has definitely changed the game, and I think the best"
583,00:32:59.96,00:32:59.96,shot is to blindside Matty right now.
584,00:33:03.88,00:33:03.88,I think I might have to jump alliances now.
585,00:33:08.04,00:33:08.04,"Oh, my God. >> Yeah."
586,00:33:13.88,00:33:13.88,>> So we're trying to figure out the best way to strategize.
587,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,I don't know. >> I think the best option is...
588,00:33:19.17,00:33:19.17,">> Yeah, tell us, 'cause you're just as smart as we are,"
589,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,and we need your input. >> I know Matty's not that
590,00:33:23.17,00:33:23.17,smart. >> So I'm wondering...
591,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,>> Marcus took it off... >> Do you think maybe the better
592,00:33:31.29,00:33:31.29,"person 'cause she's smarter than the rest of them, is"
593,00:33:33.38,00:33:33.38,Crystal? Do you think Crystal would
594,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,separate from the others? >> I think Crystal would
595,00:33:38.08,00:33:38.08,probably join us. >> So maybe...
596,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,">> And if we get Crystal in, we'll go to the final four."
597,00:33:43.75,00:33:43.75,>> Yup. >> And we'll figure it out
598,00:33:45.42,00:33:45.42,from there. >> Yeah.
599,00:33:46.67,00:33:46.67,We come up with a ridiculously harebrained scheme that
600,00:33:48.96,00:33:48.96,"shouldn't work at all, and it might actually work, which is"
601,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,"so mind-blowing. It just shows you the level of,"
602,00:33:54.54,00:33:54.54,"like, incompetence we're playing with."
603,00:34:09.04,00:34:09.04,>> What we're going to do is ask Crystal if she'd like to be
604,00:34:12.96,00:34:12.96,on our alliance. And we're giving her the chance
605,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,to join with us. I just collected these pieces.
606,00:34:21.54,00:34:21.54,I'm worse than a raven. I save everything.
607,00:34:28.00,00:34:28.00,"I don't know about you, but that would fool me."
608,00:34:31.92,00:34:31.92,(chittering) >> How close were you to Marcus
609,00:34:37.96,00:34:37.96,when he threw it in? >> We were far.
610,00:34:40.00,00:34:40.00,>> Yeah. You saw the idol that was
611,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,"on the bottle, right? >> Yeah."
612,00:34:46.58,00:34:46.58,>> It had a face on it. It was...
613,00:34:53.42,00:34:53.42,>> Right. >> That's the idol.
614,00:34:55.54,00:34:55.54,">> Final four: you, me, Kenny, and Corinne."
615,00:35:00.21,00:35:00.21,We don't want to use this tonight.
616,00:35:02.38,00:35:02.38,Would you be interested in taking out Matty tonight?
617,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,Go on board with us. >> I'm on board.
618,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,>> Operation Fake Idol II is working like a charm.
619,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,And the interesting thing is we're not even going to have
620,00:35:18.12,00:35:18.12,"to use the idol. >> Bob said ""Matty."""
621,00:35:21.58,00:35:21.58,>> We're taking out Matty? Even better for us.
622,00:35:26.62,00:35:26.62,">> Look, we have to flush out their idol."
623,00:35:28.50,00:35:28.50,>> Bob shook my hand and gave me a kiss on the cheek.
624,00:35:31.46,00:35:31.46,>> What? >> So that's a big deal for him.
625,00:35:34.12,00:35:34.12,">> Okay, look, you have to vote for Corinne."
626,00:35:36.25,00:35:36.25,>> Okay. >> You understand that.
627,00:35:37.71,00:35:37.71,>> Yes. >> Everybody's voting for
628,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17,Corinne. >> Yes.
629,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,">> Okay, I'm going to vote for Matty."
630,00:35:42.25,00:35:42.25,>> That'll be three for Matty. >> Three for Matty.
631,00:35:44.12,00:35:44.12,">> And four for Corinne. >> Yeah, I'll make sure he plays"
632,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,"the idol, so the idol's gone, Matty's gone-- boom!"
633,00:35:50.38,00:35:50.38,This is the best plan. I know for a fact that Crystal
634,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,is going to vote for Corinne. And Corinne is going to play her
635,00:35:56.92,00:35:56.92,"idol, a win-win situation for me because the idol's flushed"
636,00:36:00.17,00:36:00.17,out and Matty's going to be going home.
637,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,"So if this plan works out, oh, I'll be the biggest strategist"
638,00:36:07.67,00:36:07.67,in  Survivor  history. >> But it's going to be a little
639,00:36:10.67,00:36:10.67,tense there tonight. >> We'll have numbers out there
640,00:36:13.04,00:36:13.04,tonight anyways. I think it's a good plan.
641,00:36:15.88,00:36:15.88,>> Yeah. >> I think it's the best...
642,00:36:18.25,00:36:18.25,>> I think the four of us... It's going to be my first flop
643,00:36:21.50,00:36:21.50,"in the game, but hopefully, it's a good choice."
644,00:36:24.58,00:36:24.58,>> Every fiber of me wants to trust Kenny.
645,00:36:26.96,00:36:26.96,"If the idol is real, then Matty's gone."
646,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67,"But if they got a fake idol, Corinne goes home, and I've"
647,00:36:33.12,00:36:33.12,definitely been weighing who's better to take out.
648,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,My heart tells me to take Matty out.
649,00:36:38.12,00:36:38.12,"Corinne is not the threat to me in no way, shape or form."
650,00:36:40.75,00:36:40.75,"This is, like, my only chance to get him out, and it's been"
651,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,wracking my brain. The mental part of this game is
652,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,kicking my ass. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
653,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,"the members of our jury. Marcus, Charlie, and Randy,"
654,00:37:17.29,00:37:17.29,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
655,00:37:24.04,00:37:24.04,"Susie, can you still feel old Tribal lines, or is now"
656,00:37:28.54,00:37:28.54,"this now ""How do I win this game?"""
657,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,>> The alliances that you make have to get you to a certain
658,00:37:33.25,00:37:33.25,"point, and when people start getting paranoid, it's a domino"
659,00:37:35.62,00:37:35.62,effect. So you do have to think ahead.
660,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,">> PROBST: Bob, does this make sense, this paranoia?"
661,00:37:43.62,00:37:43.62,Is that inevitable? >> This is the first time I
662,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,haven't been paranoid. I get to realize what it feels
663,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,like to have this on. But I'll be paranoid next time
664,00:37:52.46,00:37:52.46,"I come in here. >> PROBST: Corinne, can"
665,00:37:54.79,00:37:54.79,paranoia be an advantage? >> I suppose it can.
666,00:37:57.54,00:37:57.54,"You know, obviously, Bob and I are kind of on the outside, and"
667,00:38:00.29,00:38:00.29,"they're a tight group of five. If paranoia sets in, maybe"
668,00:38:03.96,00:38:03.96,"there is a possibility to try and, you know, break it up."
669,00:38:09.29,00:38:09.29,">> PROBST: Sugar, what's the worst part about paranoia as it"
670,00:38:12.46,00:38:12.46,relates to your game? >> People freaking out and
671,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"believing lies and flipping. I mean, you just have to, like,"
672,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,keep everybody in check and make sure nobody is being
673,00:38:23.33,00:38:23.33,"gullible and getting duped. >> PROBST: Crystal, at a certain"
674,00:38:27.08,00:38:27.08,"point, does it become crazy to trust?"
675,00:38:29.25,00:38:29.25,">> With certain people, yes. Certain people, no."
676,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,>> PROBST: And is the whole trick of this game figuring out
677,00:38:37.25,00:38:37.25,when that time is? >> That is the whole trick of
678,00:38:41.08,00:38:41.08,the game: knowing when to trust and when to cut your ties.
679,00:38:47.08,00:38:47.08,">> PROBST: Kenny, is tonight's vote any more important, less"
680,00:38:50.29,00:38:50.29,important than any other vote? >> I think it's very important
681,00:38:54.25,00:38:54.25,tonight. Because you think that you can
682,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,"trust somebody, and then you don't."
683,00:38:58.29,00:38:58.29,"Because after you see the votes, you're going to be like,"
684,00:39:00.71,00:39:00.71,"""Whoa, who did this? Who did that?"""
685,00:39:02.38,00:39:02.38,"So I would say tonight's vote is very important, compared to any"
686,00:39:05.62,00:39:05.62,"other vote. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
687,00:39:08.75,00:39:08.75,"to the vote. Bob, you have the individual"
688,00:39:10.54,00:39:10.54,immunity necklace. I assume you're going to keep
689,00:39:12.42,00:39:12.42,it for yourself tonight. >> Very good assumption.
690,00:39:14.46,00:39:14.46,>> PROBST: Cannot vote for Bob. Everybody else is fair game.
691,00:39:16.54,00:39:16.54,"It is time to vote. Corinne, you're up."
692,00:39:38.62,00:39:38.62,">> Matty, this is clearly a strategic move, and I'm sorry"
693,00:39:42.71,00:39:42.71,"to see you go, bro. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
694,00:40:10.17,00:40:10.17,votes. > PROBST: If anybody has the
695,00:40:25.08,00:40:25.08,"hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be"
696,00:40:27.50,00:40:27.50,"the time to do so. >> PROBST: Okay, once the votes"
697,00:40:50.08,00:40:50.08,"are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be"
698,00:40:52.75,00:40:52.75,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
699,00:40:55.17,00:40:55.17,I'll read the votes. First vote: Matty.
700,00:41:06.17,00:41:06.17,Corinne. One vote Matty;
701,00:41:08.08,00:41:08.08,one vote Corinne. Corinne.
702,00:41:12.42,00:41:12.42,Two votes Corinne; one vote Matty.
703,00:41:18.17,00:41:18.17,Corinne. That's three votes Corinne;
704,00:41:21.04,00:41:21.04,one vote Matty. Matty.
705,00:41:26.04,00:41:26.04,Two votes Matty; three votes Corinne.
706,00:41:34.04,00:41:34.04,Matty. We're tied: three votes Corinne;
707,00:41:36.25,00:41:36.25,three votes Matty. One vote left.
708,00:41:44.25,00:41:44.25,12th person voted out of Survivor: Gabon  and the fourth
709,00:41:46.62,00:41:46.62,"member of our jury. Corrine, you need to bring me"
710,00:41:50.62,00:41:50.62,"your torch. Corinne, the tribe has spoken."
711,00:42:05.92,00:42:05.92,Time for you to go. >> Thanks.
712,00:42:16.62,00:42:16.62,">> PROBST: Well, the big theme of the night: paranoia."
713,00:42:19.29,00:42:19.29,"The question is, how do you make the paranoia work for you and"
714,00:42:23.83,00:42:23.83,not against you? Grab your torches.
715,00:42:26.42,00:42:26.42,Head back to camp. Good night.

722,00:42:55.42,00:42:55.42,position. He kind of messed with the
723,00:42:57.21,00:42:57.21,wrong guy. >> Crystal and Kenny can take
724,00:42:58.79,00:42:58.79,"out whoever they want. Kenny acts like he's this weak,"
725,00:43:01.21,00:43:01.21,"little meager guy, and he spins all these lies."
726,00:43:04.21,00:43:04.21,And Crystal is just a big bully. I can't stand Sugar.
