185,00:12:15.00,00:12:15.00,I THINK THE GOTA TRIBE IS THE BEST THAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE
186,00:12:17.83,00:12:17.83,RIGHT NOW. WE ARE THE YOUNG GOOD LUCKING
187,00:12:20.00,00:12:20.00,TRIBE. IT'S AWESOME.
188,00:12:21.03,00:12:21.03,>> GROUP HUG! THEORETICALLY THE FAVORITE CANS
189,00:12:24.97,00:12:24.97,DO WHATEVER THEY WANT BECAUSE THERE'S FOUR OF THEM AND THREE
190,00:12:26.87,00:12:26.87,OF THE FANS BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A TRIBAL
191,00:12:29.63,00:12:29.63,COUNCIL FOR A LITTLE BIT SO I THINK MY CHANCES OF GOING
192,00:12:32.10,00:12:32.10,FURTHER IN THIS GAME SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED.
193,00:12:35.90,00:12:35.90,AND SO THE STORY YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE IS EDDIE AND I ARE THE ONES
194,00:12:40.33,00:12:40.33,"EVEN KEEPING US IN THESE CHALLENGES, THEY'VE BEEN TRYING"
195,00:12:44.03,00:12:44.03,TO VOTE US OUT SINCE DAY TWO. >> WHO HAS?
196,00:12:46.60,00:12:46.60,>> SHERRI. SHE'S THE WORST.
197,00:12:49.23,00:12:49.23,SHE WAS IN LINE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BUT ME AND HIM.
198,00:12:51.13,00:12:51.13,">> WE ARE TOTALLY ON OUR OWN SO IF YOU WANT TO VOTE HER OUT,"
199,00:12:54.00,00:12:54.00,"WE'RE WITH YOU. >> YEAH, WE DON'T CARE."
200,00:12:55.67,00:12:55.67,">> RIGHT AWAY, AS SOON AS WE HIT THE BEACH, REYNOLD AND EDDIE"
201,00:12:58.73,00:12:58.73,PITCHED ME AND MALCOLM THIS IDEA THAT SHERRY IS ON THE OUTSIDE
202,00:13:02.67,00:13:02.67,AND SHE'S THE PERSON WE NEED TO GET OFF THE ISLAND SO THAT-TO-ME
203,00:13:05.87,00:13:05.87,THAT RAISES RED FLAGS. I LOOK AT REYNOLD AND I THINK
204,00:13:09.30,00:13:09.30,USED CAR SALESMAN. HE'S GOT BEAUTIFUL BABY BLUE
205,00:13:12.70,00:13:12.70,EYES TALKING THE TALK BUT IT'S NOT ALL IT SEEMS.
206,00:13:15.13,00:13:15.13,>> SHERRI'S OVER THERE TRYING TO MAKE A NEW ALLIANCE.

209,00:13:27.00,00:13:27.00,"HE'S NOT WITH REYNOLD AND HE'S THE BIGGEST SALESMAN, REYNOLD."
210,00:13:30.57,00:13:30.57,>> SO IF WE LOSE WHO DO YOU WANT TO GO?
211,00:13:32.83,00:13:32.83,>> WHO DO YOU THINK? (LAUGHTER)
212,00:13:35.10,00:13:35.10,">> HE WOULDN'T TELL YOU IF HE FOUND AN IDOL, RIGHT?"
213,00:13:37.70,00:13:37.70,>> REYNOLD PLAYED HIS IMMUNITY IDOL AT TRIBAL COUNCIL BUT I
214,00:13:41.33,00:13:41.33,THINK HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR IT CONSTANTLY.
215,00:13:43.47,00:13:43.47,>> SHERRI SPILLED THE BEANS OF THE WHOLE TRIBE TO BRENDA AND I
216,00:13:46.93,00:13:46.93,ABOUT REYNOLD AND EDDIE. SHE KIND OF SPOILED EVERYTHING
217,00:13:49.63,00:13:49.63,ABOUT THEIR TRIBE WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE STILL
218,00:13:52.87,00:13:52.87,THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF FAVORITES VERSUS FANS.
219,00:13:56.27,00:13:56.27,WE OBVIOUSLY YOU APPRECIATE YOU TELLING US THIS INFORMATION.
220,00:14:14.00,00:14:14.00,>> HERE WE ARE! >> HOME SWEET HOME.

226,00:14:35.10,00:14:35.10,IF I WASN'T AND MORON AND HASN'T PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE I'D TURN
227,00:14:40.50,00:14:40.50,ON MY ALLIANCE AND PLAY WITH THE GAY BECAUSE I LIKE GAYS.
228,00:14:43.20,00:14:43.20,"HOWEVER I WON'T DO THAT, NONE OF MY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FLIP,"
229,00:14:45.87,00:14:45.87,THAT'S FOR SURE. >> WE GOT A LITTLE DOWN TIME SO
230,00:14:51.90,00:14:51.90,THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR ME TO TALK TO YOU.
231,00:14:54.23,00:14:54.23,I HAD TO MAKE A BIG MOVE IN MY SEASON WHERE I COMPLETELY
232,00:14:57.70,00:14:57.70,"SWITCHED GEARS BECAUSE I WAS READY TO BE -- YOU KNOW, A"
233,00:15:01.20,00:15:01.20,DOUBLE AGENT IF I HAD TO BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I COULD JUST SIT PAT
234,00:15:04.57,00:15:04.57,AND SEE WHERE THINGS GO SENSE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS OR I COULD MAKE
235,00:15:07.07,00:15:07.07,A BIG MOVE. SO IF YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE A
236,00:15:09.67,00:15:09.67,"BIG MOVE WITH ME, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU SURVIVE AT LEAST"
237,00:15:12.30,00:15:12.30,"TO THE MERGE. JULIA IS A 20-YEAR-OLD VERY,"
238,00:15:17.70,00:15:17.70,VERY SMART NOT COLLEGE EDUCATED LIKE MYSELF.
239,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67,BUT SHE YOUNG. SO I WANTED TO PLANT THE SEED
240,00:15:24.87,00:15:24.87,WITH HER BECAUSE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE EASIER TO GET HER
241,00:15:27.93,00:15:27.93,TRUST THAN THE TWO MEN. >> CAN I ASK WHAT YOU SEE IN ME
242,00:15:31.50,00:15:31.50,THAT'S HAVING YOU GIVE ME THIS TALK?

244,00:15:39.53,00:15:39.53,EXTRAORDINARY. >> I THINK PHILLIP'S BEING A
245,00:15:41.87,00:15:41.87,GREAT STRATEGIC PLAYER GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION AWAY
246,00:15:44.50,00:15:44.50,THAT COULD EITHER MAKE ME FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE AND EXCITED
247,00:15:47.70,00:15:47.70,OR SKEPTICAL AND HE KNOWS THAT SO I'M HOPING TO BE ON HIS GOOD
248,00:15:51.33,00:15:51.33,PAGE BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S ALWAYS NERVE-WRACKING TO GO WHEN
249,00:15:54.90,00:15:54.90,YOU HERE IN THE MINORITY. >> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME
250,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT. I PREFER YOU KEEP IT TO
251,00:16:01.07,00:16:01.07,YOURSELF. >> I'LL DO MY BEST.

253,00:16:06.07,00:16:06.07,"AND MOVE AHEAD IN THIS GAME, PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE DOWN IN"
254,00:16:09.13,00:16:09.13,THE NUMBERS. I'M THE TYPE OF GUY THAT ONCE I
255,00:16:11.17,00:16:11.17,"SAY SOMETHING, I'M GOING TO DO THAT."
256,00:16:13.00,00:16:13.00,"THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT IS, I'M NOT GOING TO ASK TWICE."
257,00:16:16.03,00:16:16.03,MOST PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE ME BECAUSE OF MY PINK UNDERWEAR BUT
258,00:16:20.20,00:16:20.20,YOU'VE GOT TO BE READY TO MAKE A MOVE WHEN IT COMES.
259,00:16:23.03,00:16:23.03,I LEARNED THAT FROM BEING A FEDERAL AGENT.
260,00:16:35.87,00:16:35.87,>> THAT DIDN'T TAKE LONG. >> I KNOW.
261,00:16:39.13,00:16:39.13,IT TOOK SECONDS. >> THEY KIND OF JUST SLAMMED
262,00:16:41.67,00:16:41.67,HER. >> THERE'S COMPLETE DIVIDE
263,00:16:43.47,00:16:43.47,BETWEEN THEM. SHE'S PRETTY MUCH COMING TO US
264,00:16:45.73,00:16:45.73,BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY -- >> SHE'S NOT TIGHT WITH THOSE
265,00:16:48.57,00:16:48.57,TWO SO THEY'RE NOT TOGETHER. >> SO IF WE DID WANT HER AND WE
266,00:16:51.63,00:16:51.63,HAD TO SPLIT VOTES -- HE HAD AN IDOL ALREADY AND HE'S LOOKING
267,00:16:55.23,00:16:55.23,FOR ANOTHER ONE. >> HE HAD ONE AND PLAYED IT?
268,00:16:57.03,00:16:57.03,>> BECAUSE HE WAS SO PARANOID SO IF HE FINDS ANOTHER IDOL --
269,00:17:00.47,00:17:00.47,>> SO FAR YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR MORE FROM A DYSFUNCTIONAL GROUP
270,00:17:04.13,00:17:04.13,OF PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN UP WITH.
271,00:17:06.03,00:17:06.03,SHERRY DEAD SET AGAINST EDDIE AND REYNOLD.
272,00:17:08.43,00:17:08.43,THEY ARE BOTH GUNNING FOR EACH OTHER WITHIN MINUTES OF US
273,00:17:11.40,00:17:11.40,HITTING THE BEACH. >> YOU DON'T HAVE AN IDOL?
274,00:17:14.00,00:17:14.00,">> NO, I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL. >> OH, DAMN IT."

277,00:17:23.63,00:17:23.63,IT'S SITTING ON MY WRIST RIGHT NEXT TO HER HEAD.
278,00:17:27.03,00:17:27.03,I LOVE THIS GAME. SHE'S A SMART GIRL BUT I'M AN
279,00:17:30.10,00:17:30.10,ACCOMPLISHED LIAR WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN SO MAYBE I PULLED IT
280,00:17:33.13,00:17:33.13,OFF. >> THIS IS A PERFECT SCENARIO
281,00:17:34.43,00:17:34.43,FOR US. A WE'LL HOPEFULLY WIN AND WE
282,00:17:37.07,00:17:37.07,COULD SPLIT THE VOTES JUST SO THERE'S NO IDOL.
283,00:17:39.50,00:17:39.50,>> PERFECT! >> IT'S FINE.
284,00:17:55.03,00:17:55.03,I'M HAPPY SO FAR. I'M HAPPY WITH THE PLACE AND
285,00:18:01.13,00:18:01.13,"THESE GUYS SEEM VERY, VERY NICE. VERY CHILL."
286,00:18:03.77,00:18:03.77,SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
287,00:18:08.07,00:18:08.07,>> I HAD A QUIT CHAT WITH JULIA. ARE YOU PLANNING TO MAKE BIG
288,00:18:15.07,00:18:15.07,MOVES IN THIS GAME? PLANNING TO GET TO THE END?
289,00:18:17.57,00:18:17.57,BECAUSE AT THE MERGE THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING HAPPENS.
290,00:18:19.87,00:18:19.87,YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHO TO TALK TO AND WHO YOU CAN TRUST.
291,00:18:22.13,00:18:22.13,DO YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK WITH US?
292,00:18:23.73,00:18:23.73,"YOU THINK ABOUT IT. AND SHE GOES YEAH, I'LL THINK"
293,00:18:27.23,00:18:27.23,ABOUT IT. >> BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT
294,00:18:29.93,00:18:29.93,GETTING A FLIPPER. WE DON'T NEED IT.
295,00:18:31.47,00:18:31.47,>> WITHIN I WOULD SAY 30 MINUTES HE'S GOT JULIA IN A CORNER

302,00:18:48.50,00:18:48.50,IS THAT THE REASON OUR COUNTRY'S IN SUCH A MESS?
303,00:18:51.27,00:18:51.27,"LIKE, HONESTLY. >> IN TRUE PHILLIP FASHION HE"

448,00:27:28.13,00:27:28.13,BECAUSE HE DOES OUTRAGEOUS THINGS AND WE ALL JUST KEEP

544,00:32:29.30,00:32:29.30,"HOWEVER WE DON'T KNOW. EVERYONE'S PLAYING ""SURVIVOR"" SO"
545,00:32:31.97,00:32:31.97,"IT'S REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT. >> RIGHT."
546,00:32:33.50,00:32:33.50,">> AND SO, LIKE, WHO ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO VOTE?"
547,00:32:36.47,00:32:36.47,">> WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY WAS, LIKE, YOU TELL ME HOW TO VOTE."
548,00:32:40.87,00:32:40.87,THAT'S -- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YOU TELL ME.

550,00:32:46.43,00:32:46.43,SOMEONE HAS THE IDOL WE BLOW EVERYTHING.

553,00:32:54.00,00:32:54.00,IF I DID I WOULD PLAY IT TONIGHT AND NOT GIVE IT TO HIM.
554,00:32:58.30,00:32:58.30,>> IT SEEMS RELATIVELY CLEAR TO ME THAT ONE OF THE FANS IS GOING
555,00:33:02.17,00:33:02.17,TO GO HOME TONIGHT. I KIND OF LIKE THE IDEA OF
556,00:33:06.17,00:33:06.17,VOTING OFF JULIA. BUT A POSSIBLE DOWN SIDE IS THAT
557,00:33:09.37,00:33:09.37,MATT AND MICHAEL ARE OPENLY VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER SO LEAVING
558,00:33:14.07,00:33:14.07,"AN OUTSPOKEN DUO, A POWER COUPLE IN THIS GAME DOESN'T SEEM TO"

561,00:33:23.93,00:33:23.93,WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED A LOT STRATEGY WISE SO I DON'T KNOW
562,00:33:27.30,00:33:27.30,"WHERE PHILLIP LIES, IF HE'S THE KINGPIN AND THIS AND THAT."

564,00:33:37.87,00:33:37.87,OF DESPERATION. BUT IT SEEMS BETWEEN MATT AND
565,00:33:40.43,00:33:40.43,JULIA. WHO KNOWS?
566,00:33:41.07,00:33:41.07,"IF AN IDOL IS PLAYED, MAYBE IT'S ME, MAYBE IT'S CORRINE."
567,00:33:44.73,00:33:44.73,MAYBE IT'S PHILLIP. >> THE ORIGINAL PLAN IS GOING TO
568,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,"BE JULIA. THINKING ABOUT IT, MICHAEL AND"
569,00:33:53.73,00:33:53.73,MATT SEEM MUCH CLOSER TO EITHER OF THEM TO JULIA.
570,00:33:56.73,00:33:56.73,>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WHO HAS THE IDOL.
571,00:33:59.37,00:33:59.37,">> MATT DOESN'T. >> NO, MATT DOESN'T."
572,00:34:01.73,00:34:01.73,>> 100% DOES NOT. >> WE STAY IN THE GAME IF WE
573,00:34:04.57,00:34:04.57,KEEP MATT. >> AND ANY BREAKUP --
574,00:34:06.20,00:34:06.20,>> WHAT DID YOU SAY? >> MATT'S GOT TO GO.
575,00:34:08.43,00:34:08.43,">> WHY, BECAUSE YOU THINK HE HAS IT?"
576,00:34:11.23,00:34:11.23,>> I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM DO BUT I KNOW MATT DOESN'T.
577,00:34:13.40,00:34:13.40,>> BY I THINK IT SHOULD BE THE GIRL BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE
578,00:34:16.47,00:34:16.47,HAVE A CHANCE TO TURN BOTH OF THESE TWO.
579,00:34:18.70,00:34:18.70,>> THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I WAS AT.
580,00:34:20.50,00:34:20.50,>> I THINK WE CAN TURN THEM. >> TONIGHT'S VOTE IS KIND OF AS

582,00:34:30.60,00:34:30.60,GAY GOT SAVED. GOD SAVE THE GAY.
583,00:34:33.27,00:34:33.27,I AM UNDECIDED. I WOULD LOVE TO GET RID OF JULIA
584,00:34:37.27,00:34:37.27,"BECAUSE, A, SHE'S REALLY BORING. AND, B, LIKE, SHE REALLY IS THE"
585,00:34:42.13,00:34:42.13,"ONE THAT COST US THE CHALLENGE. THE THING IS, I REALLY, REALLY"
586,00:34:46.67,00:34:46.67,"LIKE MATT. MATT CAME TO ME, HE WAS HONEST"
587,00:34:48.73,00:34:48.73,"WITH ME, DOESN'T HAVE THE IDOL, I'M CONVINCE HEAD DOESN'T HAVE"
588,00:34:51.77,00:34:51.77,THE IDOL. WHY WILL I PUNISH HIM WHEN JULIA
589,00:34:54.80,00:34:54.80,HASN'T SAID TWO WORDS TO ME? SHE DOESN'T CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING
590,00:34:57.67,00:34:57.67,EXCEPT A NASALLY VOICE. SO I'M ABOUT GETTING RID OF HER.
591,00:35:00.83,00:35:00.83,IT'S REALLY HARD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.
592,00:35:28.40,00:35:28.40,"Jeff: SO, MATT, WHEN YOU GUYS FINALLY CAME TOGETHER AND"
593,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,"THERE ARE FANS NOW WITH FAVORITES, WHAT'S THAT LIKE FOR"
594,00:35:34.87,00:35:34.87,YOU BEING SUCH A FAN OF THE GAME?
595,00:35:38.23,00:35:38.23,>> I WAS SUPER STOKED. LIKE I WAS A BIG FAN OF COCHRAN
596,00:35:39.93,00:35:39.93,AND PHILLIP AND DAWN AND CORRINE SO IT WAS PRETTY SURREAL AND I
597,00:35:43.63,00:35:43.63,COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE.
598,00:35:45.77,00:35:45.77,">> Jeff: JULIA, THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS FOUR FAVORITES,"
599,00:35:49.00,00:35:49.00,THREE FANS. ARE THE FANS IN TROUBLE?
600,00:35:51.17,00:35:51.17,">> WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SILLY TO THINK THE"
601,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00,FANS WEREN'T IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE.
602,00:35:56.73,00:35:56.73,WE ARE THE MINORITY. THE FAVORITES HAVE THE NUMBERS
603,00:35:58.73,00:35:58.73,SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIVIDE.
604,00:36:00.93,00:36:00.93,">> Jeff: IS THERE A SENSE, MICHAEL, THEN THAT IT IS YOU,"
605,00:36:04.47,00:36:04.47,"JULIA, OR MATT GOING HOME TONIGHT?"
606,00:36:06.20,00:36:06.20,">> 100%, YES. ONE OF US IS GOING HOME TONIGHT."
607,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,>> Jeff: NO QUESTION? >> NOT IN MY MIND.
608,00:36:12.47,00:36:12.47,">> Jeff: CORRINE, HAVE THERE BEEN ANY BONDS MADE THAT MAKE IT"
609,00:36:16.03,00:36:16.03,HARD-- EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A GAME-- TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT?
610,00:36:18.77,00:36:18.77,>> ABSOLUTELY. >> Jeff: WHAT'S YOUR FIRST
611,00:36:20.77,00:36:20.77,IMPRESSION OF MICHAEL. >> YOU KNOW I ALWAYS LIKE TO
612,00:36:22.93,00:36:22.93,PLAY WITH A GAY. I WAS THRILLED.
613,00:36:25.30,00:36:25.30,AND THE MORE I GOT TO KNOW THE TWO OF THEM IT WAS THE SAME
614,00:36:28.10,00:36:28.10,THING. IT WAS ACTUALLY SO OVERWHELMING
615,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,"FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS, LIKE, GOD THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE"
616,00:36:33.87,00:36:33.87,"I'D REPLACE IN MY OWN ALLIANCE. THEY'RE GREAT, GREAT PEOPLE."
617,00:36:36.63,00:36:36.63,AND I STRUGGLE WITH THE FACT THAT THIS DECISION TONIGHT ISN'T
618,00:36:40.13,00:36:40.13,NECESSARILY A FAIR ONE. IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME.
619,00:36:42.73,00:36:42.73,">> Jeff: PHILLIP, WHAT'S THE CURRENCY THAT HELPED YOU DECIDE"
620,00:36:45.23,00:36:45.23,"WHO SHOULD WE KEEP TONIGHT BETWEEN MATT, JULIA, AND"
621,00:36:48.67,00:36:48.67,MICHAEL? >> THE NUMBER-ONE THING I'M
622,00:36:50.43,00:36:50.43,"GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IS ARE YOU LOYAL, ARE YOU TRUSTWORTHY"
623,00:36:53.07,00:36:53.07,AND CAN YOU DO CHALLENGES? WHEN WE GET TO THE MERGE IF I
624,00:36:55.80,00:36:55.80,ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING CAN YOU DO WHAT I ASK YOU TO DO?
625,00:36:59.00,00:36:59.00,">> Jeff: CORRINE, HOW DO YOU ASSES WHO TO GET RID OF?"
626,00:37:02.47,00:37:02.47,YOU'RE IN A GREAT SPOT. THERE ARE FOUR FAVORITES.
627,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,>> I'M NOT GOING TO MINCE WORDS. I'M PARANOID ABOUT THE HIDDEN
628,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47,"IMMUNITY IDOL AND, YEAH, SURE, IT LOOKS GOOD WHEN YOU'RE 4-3"
629,00:37:11.83,00:37:11.83,BUT IT JUST TAKES ONE IMMUNITY IDOL TO SEND ONE OF US HOME.
630,00:37:15.20,00:37:15.20,>> TRUE. >> AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE
631,00:37:16.90,00:37:16.90,ONE OF THE THREE OF THEM HAVE IT.
632,00:37:18.90,00:37:18.90,SURELY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME.
633,00:37:20.87,00:37:20.87,CLEARLY THEY WANT ME TO TELL THEM WHO I'M VOTING FOR BECAUSE
634,00:37:23.03,00:37:23.03,THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO POSITION THE IDOL BUT YOU CAN'T
635,00:37:25.63,00:37:25.63,GIVE UP ANY INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT'S DANGEROUS.
636,00:37:28.13,00:37:28.13,">> Jeff: SO, MATT, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN CORRINE IS BEING PRETTY"
637,00:37:31.63,00:37:31.63,"HONEST AND SAYING, LISTEN, I'M WORRIED SO EITHER TELL ME THE"
638,00:37:35.30,00:37:35.30,TRUTH AND CONVINCE ME OR TELL ME A LIE AND CONVINCE ME BUT YOU'VE
639,00:37:39.43,00:37:39.43,"GOT TO CONVINCE ME. >> WELL, WE TALKED TODAY ABOUT"
640,00:37:42.80,00:37:42.80,THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL. I KNOW SHE'S BEEN WORRIED ABOUT
641,00:37:46.53,00:37:46.53,IT AND I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. I TOLD HER I DON'T HAVE IT AND I
642,00:37:49.10,00:37:49.10,ALSO THINK SOME OF MY TRIBE MATES WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IF THEY
643,00:37:52.73,00:37:52.73,HAD THE IDOL AND I WOULD HAVE TOLD CORRINE WHO HAD IT.
644,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,">> AGAIN, THIS IS ""SURVIVOR"" 101."
645,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,"IF I'M THEN, WE HAVE ONE SHOT TO TURN THIS AROUND."
646,00:38:01.13,00:38:01.13,"IF WE'VE GOT ONE IDOL BETWEEN THE THREE OF US, WE PLAY OUR"
647,00:38:03.77,00:38:03.77,CARDS RIGHT WE CAN GET SOME FOOTING HERE.
648,00:38:05.47,00:38:05.47,AND I DO TRUST THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE IT.
649,00:38:11.00,00:38:11.00,BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
650,00:38:12.93,00:38:12.93,">> Jeff: PHILLIP, CORPS VIN VERY CONCERNED."
651,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,">> I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IDOL, TOO."
652,00:38:16.93,00:38:16.93,THE WAY WE'LL APPROACH THIS DECISION IS BASED ON WHETHER OR
653,00:38:20.53,00:38:20.53,NOT WE THINK YOU HAVE THE IDOL OR NOT.
654,00:38:22.63,00:38:22.63,SOUF SO IF YOU HAVE IT YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY IT.
655,00:38:24.93,00:38:24.93,IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL PROBABLY BE GOING HOME.
656,00:38:31.00,00:38:31.00,">> Jeff: COCHRAN, HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHO YOU'LL GET RID OF?"
657,00:38:34.10,00:38:34.10,IF YOU GET TO A MERGE YOU MIGHT NEED THOSE TWO PEOPLE.
658,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE OTHER TRIBE.
659,00:38:38.37,00:38:38.37,">> THAT'S THE BIG THING, ACTUALLY."
660,00:38:40.53,00:38:40.53,WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP LOSING BECAUSE THE MORE WE KEEP LOSING
661,00:38:43.37,00:38:43.37,"THE CLOSER THEY'RE GETTING ON THE OTHER TRIBE, THEY'RE LIKE"
662,00:38:46.30,00:38:46.30,THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL GROUP.
663,00:38:47.97,00:38:47.97,I DON'T SEE ME NECESSARILY PENETRATING THAT GROUP.
664,00:38:51.87,00:38:51.87,SO THE MAIN THING IS LOYALTY AND TRUST AS PHILLIP SAID IN A MERGE
665,00:38:55.53,00:38:55.53,SITUATION BUT IT'S NOT AN ENVIABLE CHOICE RIGHT NOW
666,00:39:00.23,00:39:00.23,BECAUSE THERE ARE REALLY ALL GOOD OPTIONS.
667,00:39:05.63,00:39:05.63,>> Jeff: OKAY. IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
668,00:39:08.23,00:39:08.23,"PHILLIP, YOU'RE UP. >> MY VOTE IS FOR YOU, JULIA."
669,00:39:26.50,00:39:26.50,I HOPE IT'S YOU AND NOT ME TONIGHT.
670,00:39:36.57,00:39:36.57,">> DARLING, YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE GREAT, I'M JUST TRYING TO"
671,00:39:39.90,00:39:39.90,LIVE TO SEE ONE MORE DAY. >> I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
672,00:39:59.60,00:39:59.60,IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT
673,00:40:03.13,00:40:03.13,"TO-TO-PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO."
674,00:40:12.60,00:40:12.60,"OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE DECISION IS FINAL."
675,00:40:14.90,00:40:14.90,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
676,00:40:17.97,00:40:17.97,IMMEDIATELY. I'LL READ THE VOTES.
677,00:40:22.47,00:40:22.47,"FIRST VOTE, JULIA. TWO VOTES JULIA."
678,00:40:31.37,00:40:31.37,DAWN. TWO VOTES JULIA; ONE VOTE DAWN.

685,00:41:17.30,00:41:17.30,">> SEE YOU, MAN. >> Jeff: WELL IF TONIGHT'S"
686,00:41:27.23,00:41:27.23,"VOTE IS ANY INDICATION, JULIA, MICHAEL, NEW TROUBLE."
