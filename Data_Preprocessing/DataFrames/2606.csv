632,00:37:20.87,00:37:20.87,CLEARLY THEY WANT ME TO TELLTHEM WHO I'M VOTING FOR BECAUSE
633,00:37:23.03,00:37:23.03,THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TOPOSITION THE IDOL BUT YOU CAN'T
634,00:37:25.63,00:37:25.63,GIVE UP ANY INFORMATION BECAUSETHAT'S DANGEROUS.

641,00:37:49.10,00:37:49.10,ALSO THINK SOME OF MY TRIBEMATES WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IF THEY
642,00:37:52.73,00:37:52.73,HAD THE IDOL AND I WOULD HAVETOLD CORRINE WHO HAD IT.
643,00:37:55.70,00:37:55.70,">> AGAIN, THIS IS ""SURVIVOR""101."

653,00:38:22.63,00:38:22.63,SOUF SO IF YOU HAVE IT YOU'REGOING TO PLAY IT.
654,00:38:24.93,00:38:24.93,IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL PROBABLY BEGOING HOME.

656,00:38:34.10,00:38:34.10,IF YOU GET TO A MERGE YOU MIGHTNEED THOSE TWO PEOPLE.
657,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENINGON THE OTHER TRIBE.
658,00:38:38.37,00:38:38.37,">> THAT'S THE BIG THING,ACTUALLY."
659,00:38:40.53,00:38:40.53,WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP LOSINGBECAUSE THE MORE WE KEEP LOSING
660,00:38:43.37,00:38:43.37,"THE CLOSER THEY'RE GETTING ONTHE OTHER TRIBE, THEY'RE LIKE"

662,00:38:47.97,00:38:47.97,I DON'T SEE ME NECESSARILYPENETRATING THAT GROUP.
663,00:38:51.87,00:38:51.87,SO THE MAIN THING IS LOYALTY ANDTRUST AS PHILLIP SAID IN A MERGE
664,00:38:55.53,00:38:55.53,SITUATION BUT IT'S NOT ANENVIABLE CHOICE RIGHT NOW
665,00:39:00.23,00:39:00.23,BECAUSE THERE ARE REALLY ALLGOOD OPTIONS.
