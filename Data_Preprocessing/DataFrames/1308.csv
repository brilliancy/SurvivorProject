5,00:00:09.25,00:00:09.25,">> It's your personality. >> Well, you could have said"
6,00:00:10.92,00:00:10.92,something to me. I never thought that's what they
7,00:00:12.38,00:00:12.38,thought of me. >> PROBST: At the challenge...
8,00:00:14.54,00:00:14.54,"Good news, bad news. The good news is the winners"
9,00:00:16.50,00:00:16.50,will feast. The bad news is you'll be
10,00:00:19.46,00:00:19.46,feasting at tribal council. >> Ooh!
11,00:00:22.21,00:00:22.21,>> PROBST: Go! Aitu endured the physical
12,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,test... Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.
13,00:00:28.92,00:00:28.92,...and gave Raro a beating. Aitu wins the challenge!
14,00:00:32.46,00:00:32.46,Here's how it's going to work tonight.
15,00:00:35.75,00:00:35.75,Aitu will go to tribal council first.
16,00:00:38.21,00:00:38.21,You will vote somebody out. You will then enjoy your feast
17,00:00:40.67,00:00:40.67,while listening in on Raro's tribal council.
18,00:00:44.71,00:00:44.71,On Raro... >> Would you give me a chance
19,00:00:47.08,00:00:47.08,tonight? >> PROBST: Christina scrambled
20,00:00:49.17,00:00:49.17,to save herself. >> I had no idea.
21,00:00:51.00,00:00:51.00,I'm very sorry. I'm trying to talk to some
22,00:00:52.58,00:00:52.58,people. And hopefully I won't get booted
23,00:00:54.29,00:00:54.29,out tonight. >> PROBST: Back at Aitu...
24,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,>> I'm going to find a way to defeat him.
25,00:00:58.00,00:00:58.00,">> PROBST: Thinking Jonathan had the hidden immunity idol, Cao"
26,00:01:00.04,00:01:00.04,Boi dreamed up Plan Voodoo. >> We force the idol out.
27,00:01:02.92,00:01:02.92,>> I think the plan is ingenious.
28,00:01:04.62,00:01:04.62,I know neither Jonathan nor Candice have the hidden
29,00:01:06.62,00:01:06.62,"immunity idol, because I have it."
30,00:01:09.29,00:01:09.29,>> PROBST: But at tribal council...
31,00:01:11.12,00:01:11.12,The sixth person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands...
32,00:01:13.17,00:01:13.17,"Cao Boi's Plan Voodoo folded, and his wildcard personality"
33,00:01:16.08,00:01:16.08,"finally caught up with him... Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken."
34,00:01:19.58,00:01:19.58,"...and he was voted out. Well, the hard part's over."
35,00:01:23.54,00:01:23.54,Now for the fun. Aitu enjoyed a succulent
36,00:01:26.83,00:01:26.83,spread... >> People in our group plain out
37,00:01:29.62,00:01:29.62,"said, ""You're annoying."" >> PROBST: ...while listening in"
38,00:01:32.79,00:01:32.79,on Raro's brutal honesty about Christina.
39,00:01:35.21,00:01:35.21,">> Unfortunately, she just found out our true feelings."

50,00:02:17.54,00:02:17.54,>> I imagine this camp is nicer than your camp.
51,00:02:20.50,00:02:20.50,">> You guys have more space, I'll say."
52,00:02:22.54,00:02:22.54,"But it seems like we've got, like, more hibiscus and more"
53,00:02:24.38,00:02:24.38,coconuts. What a twist.
54,00:02:29.04,00:02:29.04,The Aitutaki guys have kidnapped me to come over for the night.
55,00:02:31.08,00:02:31.08,"I took it as an honor. You know, you think I'm a good"
56,00:02:33.21,00:02:33.21,"competitor, thank you. >> Are you a good swimmer?"
57,00:02:37.17,00:02:37.17,Are you a good... >> Yeah.
58,00:02:38.67,00:02:38.67,">> You're a good swimmer, runner, sprinter."
59,00:02:40.29,00:02:40.29,">> They started, like, sweating me out, asking me all these"
60,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17,"questions. Like, just feeding some nuts,"
61,00:02:43.92,00:02:43.92,"you know, not hating. Stuff that really doesn't"
62,00:02:46.21,00:02:46.21,"matter, I think, in the game. There are a lot of obstacles"
63,00:02:48.21,00:02:48.21,"which make it easy and it feeds a lot of meat in those, a lot of"
64,00:02:51.29,00:02:51.29,"meat. I'm always playing the game, so,"
65,00:02:53.92,00:02:53.92,"you know, just... I've got my eyes open very much, eyes and"
66,00:02:57.33,00:02:57.33,"ears, to the tenth. >> We had to get rid of Cao Boi."
67,00:03:01.67,00:03:01.67,"Obviously, that part sucked, you know?"
68,00:03:04.04,00:03:04.04,">> Yeah, I just wish I was clued in on what was going on, because"
69,00:03:05.71,00:03:05.71,"now I kind of feel, like, nervous."
70,00:03:09.17,00:03:09.17,I'd rather be on the same page and know what's going on than
71,00:03:11.29,00:03:11.29,"not. Just be, you know, clued in."
72,00:03:14.25,00:03:14.25,The vote knocked me off my socks for a moment.
73,00:03:18.83,00:03:18.83,"You know everyone was blindsiding me by saying, ""No,"
74,00:03:20.88,00:03:20.88,"no, we're going with, you know, this other plan."""
75,00:03:24.33,00:03:24.33,"And I just wasn't expecting, you know, it to be Cao Boi at that"
76,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,point. I just don't want it to be me
77,00:03:32.17,00:03:32.17,"this next time, so I'm trying to figure out where people are at."
78,00:03:34.46,00:03:34.46,"I totally had voted for Jonathan, but I'm trying to get"
79,00:03:37.12,00:03:37.12,a clue on what's going to happen next kind of thing.
80,00:03:40.75,00:03:40.75,>> I played my cards right. I got me some good info right
81,00:03:44.08,00:03:44.08,"now. It was like, ""Oh, thanks, more"
82,00:03:46.00,00:03:46.00,"info."" So I'm going to take my little"
83,00:03:48.00,00:03:48.00,notepad and I'm going to go back to my tribe and let them know
84,00:03:51.04,00:03:51.04,what's going on so that we can make some moves and really
85,00:03:54.08,00:03:54.08,battle it out. >> Flicka's going crazy right
86,00:03:57.88,00:03:57.88,"now. She's like, ""I want to be in on"
87,00:03:59.88,00:03:59.88,"the planning with you."" So we need to come up with a"
88,00:04:01.71,00:04:01.71,story. >> The thing I don't like is
89,00:04:03.42,00:04:03.42,"that she's been doing it in front of Nate, right?"
90,00:04:05.08,00:04:05.08,">> Like, that whole conversation happened right in front of Nate."
91,00:04:06.58,00:04:06.58,And I'm like... >> But we have to know our top
92,00:04:08.12,00:04:08.12,three. >> To vote off?
93,00:04:10.04,00:04:10.04,">> I feel most comfortable if we have a third, just because, you"
94,00:04:12.46,00:04:12.46,"know, within our five we don't want to just blow up."
95,00:04:15.46,00:04:15.46,">> I mean, I think we should stay with the same plan, but in"
96,00:04:17.79,00:04:17.79,"terms of order it would be Ozzy, Flicka, right, followed by..."
97,00:04:23.33,00:04:23.33,">> Who would you rather compete in individual immunity, Sundra"
98,00:04:25.58,00:04:25.58,or Jonathan? >> Jonathan before Sundra?
99,00:04:27.38,00:04:27.38,">> Yeah. Oh, yeah."
100,00:04:29.21,00:04:29.21,>> I'm going to go back. >> Originally the order of
101,00:04:33.12,00:04:33.12,"getting voted out was Ozzy would be next, followed by Flicka,"
102,00:04:36.58,00:04:36.58,"followed by Sundra, and then it would be the remaining four."
103,00:04:41.04,00:04:41.04,But we feel like we're starting to get to the point where a
104,00:04:43.25,00:04:43.25,"merge is imminent, so now there's been talk about, well,"
105,00:04:44.96,00:04:44.96,"if we come down to it, do we vote off Jonathan before we vote"
106,00:04:47.08,00:04:47.08,off Sundra? He'd be a tough person to go up
107,00:04:49.12,00:04:49.12,against in an individual competition.
108,00:06:11.21,00:06:11.21,">> Okay, here we go. You guys ready?"
109,00:06:14.42,00:06:14.42,"""Swim, fly, dive, think. Either way, you are in the"

111,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,pick two. And they could be yours by the

116,00:06:41.83,00:06:41.83,>> The tree mail was awesome. It was a catalog.
117,00:06:46.00,00:06:46.00,We got to choose two items that if we win the reward today we
118,00:06:49.25,00:06:49.25,get to have. >> You guys vote for what you
119,00:06:52.12,00:06:52.12,"want to vote for, okay? It's a democracy."
120,00:06:53.96,00:06:53.96,>> Peanut butter. >> That's eight votes.
121,00:06:56.00,00:06:56.00,>> I think potatoes. Do you want bread?
122,00:06:58.29,00:06:58.29,It's ultimately... >> What right now?
123,00:07:00.42,00:07:00.42,>> What do you want? >> I'm just being rational.
124,00:07:02.46,00:07:02.46,">> Peanut butter and bread. >> I want bread, too."
125,00:07:05.42,00:07:05.42,">> You think about, like, challenges next week, you"
126,00:07:07.29,00:07:07.29,definitely need that carbohydrate.
127,00:07:09.83,00:07:09.83,"I had wanted a bag of potatoes and then peanut butter, trying"
128,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,to be the voice of reason. >> Couldn't we just have bread?
129,00:07:16.54,00:07:16.54,">> It won't last as long, but... >> You could make a peanut"
130,00:07:18.29,00:07:18.29,butter sandwich. >> You can have potatoes with
131,00:07:21.21,00:07:21.21,"seafood next week. >> Three against two, though."
132,00:07:24.92,00:07:24.92,"I mean, guys, I don't know... >> Okay, whatever."
133,00:07:27.12,00:07:27.12,"That's fine. Okay, so put bread."
134,00:07:28.83,00:07:28.83,"I was trying to think the longevity of the tribe, but I've"
135,00:07:31.00,00:07:31.00,"got to do what the majority votes, right?"
136,00:07:37.25,00:07:37.25,">> PROBST: Aitu, Raro, come on in!"
137,00:07:47.71,00:07:47.71,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?"
138,00:07:49.79,00:07:49.79,>> Yeah. >> Yes.
139,00:07:51.50,00:07:51.50,>> PROBST: Here's how it works. Each tribe will select three
140,00:07:53.83,00:07:53.83,"swimmers and two puzzle makers. On my ""go,"" the first swimmer"
141,00:07:57.00,00:07:57.00,"will grab a club, swim out to a platform, climb to the top, and"
142,00:08:01.71,00:08:01.71,"then leap off of the platform. While in midair, you will smash"
143,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,"a plaster box, releasing a key. You'll then dive down, retrieve"
144,00:08:11.42,00:08:11.42,"the key, swim back to shore. You'll continue doing this until"
145,00:08:14.92,00:08:14.92,you have retrieved six keys. Each swimmer must swim out at
146,00:08:19.25,00:08:19.25,least one time. And each swimmer can only
147,00:08:22.88,00:08:22.88,retrieve one key at a time. The two puzzle makers will then
148,00:08:27.08,00:08:27.08,use those six keys to open six locks on a chest.
149,00:08:31.04,00:08:31.04,"Inside the chest, puzzle pieces. First tribe to assemble a puzzle"
150,00:08:34.88,00:08:34.88,"map of the world wins reward. Raro, here's what you picked to"
151,00:08:38.58,00:08:38.58,play for. Bread and peanut butter.
152,00:08:44.29,00:08:44.29,"Aitu, here's what you picked. Bag of potatoes and peanut"
153,00:08:48.17,00:08:48.17,butter. >> Yeah.
154,00:08:50.38,00:08:50.38,">> PROBST: Okay, Aitu, you have to sit three people out."
155,00:08:52.83,00:08:52.83,"Who are you sitting out? Jessica, Sundra, Nate."
156,00:08:56.17,00:08:56.17,"So you take Nate to keep him from competing with Raro, but"
157,00:09:00.38,00:09:00.38,you don't trust him to compete with your tribe.
158,00:09:02.67,00:09:02.67,"Is that what I'm reading? Nate, you'll rejoin your Raro"
159,00:09:06.42,00:09:06.42,tribe after this challenge. >> Awesome.
160,00:09:09.75,00:09:09.75,>> PROBST: One more part of the reward.
161,00:09:12.17,00:09:12.17,"In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member from the"
162,00:09:14.92,00:09:14.92,losing tribe to go to Exile Island.
163,00:09:17.25,00:09:17.25,I'll give you a minute to figure out who your swimmers are going
164,00:09:19.50,00:09:19.50,"to be, and we'll get started. >> I'd rather do puzzle."
165,00:09:22.04,00:09:22.04,I can do puzzles like the back of my hand.
166,00:09:29.04,00:09:29.04,">> PROBST: All right, the swimmers for Aitu-- Ozzy,"
167,00:09:32.08,00:09:32.08,"Candice, and Yul. The swimmers for Raro-- Rebecca,"
168,00:09:35.54,00:09:35.54,"Parvati, and Adam. For reward, survivors ready."
169,00:09:39.67,00:09:39.67,Go! Ozzy and Rebecca first in the
170,00:09:43.12,00:09:43.12,water. Ozzy tosses his club.
171,00:09:47.21,00:09:47.21,"Not going to bother swimming with it, throws it out ahead."
172,00:09:51.58,00:09:51.58,Rebecca quickly falling behind. Big lead for Aitu right off the
173,00:09:56.54,00:09:56.54,bat. Ozzy smashes the box and the key
174,00:10:00.83,00:10:00.83,drops. Now he's got to find it.
175,00:10:03.58,00:10:03.58,Rebecca still working her way toward the platform.
176,00:10:08.62,00:10:08.62,Ozzy has the key and he's swimming back.
177,00:10:11.29,00:10:11.29,">> Go, Ozzy! Go, Ozzy!"
178,00:10:13.58,00:10:13.58,>> PROBST: Rebecca can hardly get up on the platform.
179,00:10:16.29,00:10:16.29,>> Ozzy! >> PROBST: Ozzy back with the
180,00:10:18.58,00:10:18.58,first key. Yul heads out for Aitu.
181,00:10:21.46,00:10:21.46,Rebecca finally up on the platform.
182,00:10:24.21,00:10:24.21,Yul swimming out for Aitu. Rebecca's got to find the key.
183,00:10:30.38,00:10:30.38,Rebecca's heading back without a key.
184,00:10:35.08,00:10:35.08,">> Come on, Yul! >> PROBST: Yul at the platform"
185,00:10:38.29,00:10:38.29,for Aitu. Rebecca really struggling in the
186,00:10:42.08,00:10:42.08,water. Yul has the second key for Aitu.
187,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Yul gaining on
188,00:10:48.92,00:10:48.92,Rebecca. He's about to lap her.

266,00:15:47.88,00:15:47.88,">> Candice, go get it. >> Smooth or crunchy?"

268,00:16:07.46,00:16:07.46,everybody that I can see right now.
269,00:16:11.12,00:16:11.12,"If anybody wants a kiss, just come over here."
270,00:16:14.25,00:16:14.25,I love you. ( laughter )
271,00:16:21.83,00:16:21.83,">> Got to love that. >> Oh, the sweet taste of peanut"
272,00:16:24.08,00:16:24.08,"butter. I mean, I haven't tasted peanut"
273,00:16:26.50,00:16:26.50,butter that tasted so good in my life.
274,00:16:29.29,00:16:29.29,>> Peanut butter kisses for everybody.
275,00:16:32.46,00:16:32.46,">> I hope that we continue to grow as a tribe and, you know,"
276,00:16:36.21,00:16:36.21,"maybe work some things out, and who knows?"
277,00:16:39.04,00:16:39.04,"Things just change constantly in this game, and you never really"
278,00:16:42.54,00:16:42.54,know what's going to happen. >> Right?
279,00:17:13.54,00:17:13.54,>> My team really could have used me today.
280,00:17:16.25,00:17:16.25,"They really could have used me. For me, it's frustrating because"
281,00:17:20.38,00:17:20.38,I couldn't do anything. I couldn't compete.
282,00:17:22.79,00:17:22.79,I'm a good swimmer. >> The only reason I sat out
283,00:17:27.46,00:17:27.46,because I really felt like we needed... we kept choking at
284,00:17:29.92,00:17:29.92,"the... >> We needed you swimming,"
285,00:17:31.42,00:17:31.42,"brother. >> The thing is, we always choke"
286,00:17:33.25,00:17:33.25,"at the very end. And I feel like... I mean,"
287,00:17:34.67,00:17:34.67,puzzles... I can... I'm creative spatial.
288,00:17:36.21,00:17:36.21,"I do puzzles. Like, I get puzzles."
289,00:17:38.08,00:17:38.08,I look at something and I can... >> I think...
290,00:17:40.08,00:17:40.08,">> But you're right, we did need a strong..."
291,00:17:42.71,00:17:42.71,>> We needed another guy swimming.
292,00:17:44.92,00:17:44.92,For Brad to take the back seat today and want to be puzzle boy
293,00:17:48.08,00:17:48.08,"when we have a swimming challenge, pissed me off."
294,00:17:51.46,00:17:51.46,I don't know what his deal was. Maybe he didn't want to get wet.
295,00:17:53.71,00:17:53.71,Maybe he was cold. Maybe he's a Nancy boy.
296,00:17:55.71,00:17:55.71,"I do not know what he was thinking, but he did not get his"
297,00:17:58.21,00:17:58.21,ass up and swim. We needed him there.
298,00:18:00.92,00:18:00.92,I don't care about no stupid puzzle.
299,00:18:02.54,00:18:02.54,"""I'm good at puzzles. I'm real..."" I don't care about"
300,00:18:04.25,00:18:04.25,that nonsense. >> He know he's one of our best
301,00:18:10.54,00:18:10.54,swimmers. He knows that.
302,00:18:12.25,00:18:12.25,"He's like, ""What's best for the team."""
303,00:18:14.42,00:18:14.42,"How hard is it to do a puzzle? >> That really pissed, me off"
304,00:18:17.29,00:18:17.29,because Rebecca was cashed. I don't know why he insisted on
305,00:18:22.12,00:18:22.12,the puzzle. I want to punch him in the
306,00:18:24.79,00:18:24.79,mouth. I'm so angry right now.
307,00:18:27.08,00:18:27.08,"I'm like... God, that was miserable today."
308,00:18:33.08,00:18:33.08,>> Now we've got a storm coming from Lord knows what.
309,00:18:39.00,00:18:39.00,It's cold. And I got to come out here and
310,00:18:41.25,00:18:41.25,"fish and go back and get wood, and the girls are burned out, so"
311,00:18:43.42,00:18:43.42,"I want them to rest. It's like, thanks for the lovely"
312,00:18:46.17,00:18:46.17,"way to come home, you know? >> I'm not happy to be back at"
313,00:18:55.04,00:18:55.04,Exile Island. I am starting to doubt my tribe.
314,00:18:58.12,00:18:58.12,"Challenge after challenge, they just don't come through."
315,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,"You know, it's hard to soar like an eagle when you're"
316,00:19:03.62,00:19:03.62,surround by turkeys. >> It hurts to be out here.
317,00:19:36.38,00:19:36.38,"The actual rain with the wind, it kills you."
318,00:19:41.92,00:19:41.92,I was pretty much just in a fetal position.
319,00:19:45.25,00:19:45.25,I hoped that it would go away. >> I caught a bird.
320,00:20:12.54,00:20:12.54,>> Wow. >> What do you guys want to do
321,00:20:14.96,00:20:14.96,"with it? >> Kill it quick, if you're"
322,00:20:16.75,00:20:16.75,going to eat it. It's suffering.
323,00:20:18.96,00:20:18.96,>> It's not suffering. I'm holding it firmly.
324,00:20:20.83,00:20:20.83,>> You could let it go and it could go away.
325,00:20:23.08,00:20:23.08,>> Eat it. >> We should probably eat it.
326,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,>> That's why you caught it-- eat it.
327,00:20:27.12,00:20:27.12,>> Yul? >> Eat it.
328,00:20:28.92,00:20:28.92,">> Yul, get up. >> I went to go to the bathroom"
329,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,and it was in the bushes sleeping.
330,00:20:35.08,00:20:35.08,And I just crept up on it. >> It's about as big as a
331,00:20:42.92,00:20:42.92,"chicken. All right, I'll pluck it."
332,00:20:47.46,00:20:47.46,">> Good job, man. Good job, Yul."
333,00:20:50.54,00:20:50.54,"Good job, Oz. >> Good morning!"
334,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,">> Well, then... >> All right, good."
335,00:21:00.08,00:21:00.08,Let's... let's respect it and eat it and enjoy it and get
336,00:21:05.04,00:21:05.04,nourishment from it. Cool.
337,00:21:10.00,00:21:10.00,">> Ozzy is amazing. He's like half animal, half man,"
338,00:21:14.25,00:21:14.25,"you know, part fish, part monkey part the lord knows what."
339,00:21:20.17,00:21:20.17,>> Will you make me a tree fort? He's so high up there right now.
340,00:21:26.50,00:21:26.50,">> He's kind of like the little jungle boy, you know, climbing"
341,00:21:28.58,00:21:28.58,"these coconut trees and getting coconuts down, getting fish."
342,00:21:31.75,00:21:31.75,>> Almost the colors of the rainbow.
343,00:21:33.88,00:21:33.88,">> I mean, coming up with this bird."
344,00:21:37.04,00:21:37.04,"I mean, Ozzy... ( sighs )"
345,00:21:40.38,00:21:40.38,...he's just Ozzy. >> The guy is surprising.
346,00:21:50.17,00:21:50.17,"I mean, I underestimated him. He provides a lot of food, but,"
347,00:21:53.04,00:21:53.04,"you know, at the same time, ultimately, we feel that we"
348,00:21:55.42,00:21:55.42,should get rid of him while we still have the control rather
349,00:21:58.79,00:21:58.79,than wait for a merge and potentially have him dominate
350,00:22:01.04,00:22:01.04,some of the individual challenges.
351,00:22:03.08,00:22:03.08,>> So what do you think is going to happen?
352,00:22:06.50,00:22:06.50,>> I have to get my butt in here.
353,00:22:08.71,00:22:08.71,Okay. >> We need a plan.
354,00:22:10.46,00:22:10.46,>> What kind of plan? >> I need to just know what's
355,00:22:12.54,00:22:12.54,happening. What's going to...
356,00:22:14.21,00:22:14.21,>> I don't know. I don't...
357,00:22:16.17,00:22:16.17,">> What happens, though, like, say, okay, we did have to go to"
358,00:22:18.54,00:22:18.54,tribal council and we did have to vote someone out?
359,00:22:21.08,00:22:21.08,>> I don't know. What do you guys think?
360,00:22:23.50,00:22:23.50,">> Well, the biggest issue, the number one issue, is none of us"
361,00:22:27.12,00:22:27.12,trust Jonathan. He's just always... the gears
362,00:22:29.75,00:22:29.75,"are always turning with him, and it kind of makes us uneasy."
363,00:22:33.50,00:22:33.50,>> I think that we could honestly make the strongest
364,00:22:37.71,00:22:37.71,"alliance, because you two are the strongest girls, and I"
365,00:22:41.79,00:22:41.79,don't... I don't... >> Three doesn't make anything.
366,00:22:45.04,00:22:45.04,">> Yeah, but we... I think we could work it."
367,00:22:48.25,00:22:48.25,>> I don't think... I don't think... it doesn't work out
368,00:22:50.79,00:22:50.79,"when you say it like that, but if there's two other people,"
369,00:22:53.92,00:22:53.92,like Yul and Becky that were also... or if it was us and
370,00:22:56.25,00:22:56.25,Sundra. But I just want you to know if
371,00:22:58.83,00:22:58.83,"you want to, I mean, you can trust me."
372,00:23:02.83,00:23:02.83,"And if I do end up leaving, if some strategy works out and I"
373,00:23:09.17,00:23:09.17,"get voted off, then what are you guys going to eat?"
374,00:23:14.00,00:23:14.00,I think I'm a more valuable player than Jonathan at this
375,00:23:16.21,00:23:16.21,point. He can't provide for people.
376,00:23:20.12,00:23:20.12,"So if they get rid of me, where is that going to leave them?"
377,00:23:23.54,00:23:23.54,It's going to start getting to that point where food is going
378,00:23:25.67,00:23:25.67,to become an issue for everybody.
379,00:23:27.54,00:23:27.54,"I might be more of a threat, but the people that do stick with"
380,00:23:29.62,00:23:29.62,"me, they're going to be able to enjoy a ride."
381,00:23:49.88,00:23:49.88,">> PROBST: come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Adam,"
382,00:24:03.21,00:24:03.21,returning from Exile Island. >> How's everyone doing?
383,00:24:08.04,00:24:08.04,Give me a hug. Come on.
384,00:24:10.71,00:24:10.71,Good to see you. >> How you doing?
385,00:24:13.50,00:24:13.50,">> PROBST: Adam, I think it's safe to say you had the worst"
386,00:24:17.04,00:24:17.04,night anybody's ever had on Exile.
387,00:24:19.83,00:24:19.83,">> It was extremely rough there, Jeff."
388,00:24:22.33,00:24:22.33,>> PROBST: Tell me about the storm.
389,00:24:24.29,00:24:24.29,We all felt it. >> It was tough.
390,00:24:26.08,00:24:26.08,"I mean, it was raining pretty hard."
391,00:24:28.17,00:24:28.17,"It was hitting me on the back, it was stinging me."
392,00:24:30.21,00:24:30.21,"You know, I was just shivering all night."
393,00:24:32.04,00:24:32.04,I was in pain. It was rough.
394,00:24:33.79,00:24:33.79,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
395,00:24:35.42,00:24:35.42,">> Yes. >> PROBST: First things first,"
396,00:24:36.46,00:24:36.46,Yul. Take back immunity.
397,00:24:40.50,00:24:40.50,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
398,00:24:43.88,00:24:43.88,"For today's challenge, each tribe will race to arrange a"
399,00:24:48.21,00:24:48.21,series of logs from shortest to tallest as you build a staircase
400,00:24:53.83,00:24:53.83,to the top of the tower. Three tribe members will sail
401,00:24:57.25,00:24:57.25,"down a zipline into the water, retrieve a bag of puzzle pieces,"
402,00:25:01.33,00:25:01.33,swim back to shore. Then the next person goes.
403,00:25:04.25,00:25:04.25,The three remaining tribe members will use those pieces to
404,00:25:07.21,00:25:07.21,solve a puzzle. The first tribe to solve their
405,00:25:11.12,00:25:11.12,"puzzle correctly wins immunity, guaranteed a one in 12 shot at a"
406,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,"million dollars. Losers, tribal council tonight,"
407,00:25:18.25,00:25:18.25,"somebody will be voted out. Aitu, because you have one extra"
408,00:25:21.96,00:25:21.96,"member, you're sitting somebody out."
409,00:25:23.75,00:25:23.75,You cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back
410,00:25:25.42,00:25:25.42,challenges. Sundra and Jessica sat out the
411,00:25:27.08,00:25:27.08,last challenge. Who is it going to be this time?
412,00:25:29.04,00:25:29.04,">> I am. >> PROBST: Jonathan, take a spot"
413,00:25:30.71,00:25:30.71,"over here. >> Good luck, guys."
414,00:25:32.42,00:25:32.42,">> PROBST: I'll give you a few minutes to strategize, and we'll"
415,00:25:34.21,00:25:34.21,"get started. Here we go, for immunity."
416,00:25:40.04,00:25:40.04,Survivors ready? Go!
417,00:25:47.04,00:25:47.04,"Logs are heavy. Some people carrying, others"
418,00:25:52.92,00:25:52.92,dragging. Everybody working.
419,00:26:00.75,00:26:00.75,Building a staircase from shortest to tallest.
420,00:26:05.08,00:26:05.08,Got to figure out the order. Ozzy and Yul think they have the
421,00:26:08.67,00:26:08.67,tallest log. >> This one's taller.
422,00:26:12.79,00:26:12.79,>> Why don't you pick it up and put it next to it?
423,00:26:16.88,00:26:16.88,>> PROBST: Women doing a lot of the work for Raro.
424,00:26:18.88,00:26:18.88,They're building it from the bottom up while the guys debate
425,00:26:21.12,00:26:21.12,which is the longest log. The key is that you put these in
426,00:26:24.21,00:26:24.21,the right order. You're just making more work.
427,00:26:27.50,00:26:27.50,>> That's it! >> PROBST: Aitu getting the hang
428,00:26:29.75,00:26:29.75,of it now. >> That's great.
429,00:26:32.71,00:26:32.71,">> PROBST: The quicker you get this built, the quicker you get"
430,00:26:34.50,00:26:34.50,to the top. >> Yeah!
431,00:26:36.46,00:26:36.46,>> PROBST: Ozzy puts in the last log.
432,00:26:38.17,00:26:38.17,"Aitu has it. >> Go, guys!"
433,00:26:40.42,00:26:40.42,That's it! >> PROBST: Once all six to the

435,00:26:48.00,00:26:48.00,Aitu. >> Hang on!
436,00:26:52.38,00:26:52.38,>> Help me out. Help me out.
437,00:26:57.04,00:26:57.04,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Yul in the water.
438,00:27:02.00,00:27:02.00,Raro has it! Raro up the staircase.

440,00:27:10.25,00:27:10.25,"Got to get up here, Nate. Go!"
441,00:27:12.75,00:27:12.75,"Brad, first down the zipline. Brad into the water."
442,00:27:24.46,00:27:24.46,Brad has his bag. He's swimming back.
443,00:27:27.67,00:27:27.67,Aitu with a bit of a lead. >> That throwing is excellent.
444,00:27:31.00,00:27:31.00,">> Let's go, Brad! >> PROBST: Yul back for Aitu."
445,00:27:35.62,00:27:35.62,"Once he's on the mat, go, Candice!"
446,00:27:38.08,00:27:38.08,Candice down the zipline for Aitu.
447,00:27:41.79,00:27:41.79,Going as fast as she can. Candice goes deep on the
448,00:27:47.25,00:27:47.25,"zipline, drops herself right at the bag."
449,00:27:50.12,00:27:50.12,Brad's got to get back to the mat.
450,00:27:53.58,00:27:53.58,Parvati ready to go. >> Go as far as you can.
451,00:27:56.04,00:27:56.04,>> PROBST: Go! >> Swing your body.
452,00:27:58.12,00:27:58.12,Swing! >> PROBST: Parvati getting some
453,00:28:00.42,00:28:00.42,momentum. She's in a full tuck.
454,00:28:03.71,00:28:03.71,Parvati in the water now. Parvati has a bag for Raro.
455,00:28:07.33,00:28:07.33,She's swimming back. Candice swimming back for Aitu.
456,00:28:11.04,00:28:11.04,Aitu still with the lead. Ozzy ready to go.
457,00:28:16.83,00:28:16.83,"Once she hits the mat, go, Ozzy! Ozzy swinging."
458,00:28:22.04,00:28:22.04,In a monkey pose. Parvati swimming back.
459,00:28:28.54,00:28:28.54,"Let's go, Parvati! What are you doing walking?"
460,00:28:32.54,00:28:32.54,Raro losing more time on the swimming leg again.
461,00:28:37.62,00:28:37.62,Ozzy swimming like a dolphin as he makes up time.
462,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,">> Come on Pavarti! Push it Pavarti, push it!"
463,00:28:47.17,00:28:47.17,You got it! >> PROBST: Parvati is back.
464,00:28:49.08,00:28:49.08,"Go, Nate. Nate down the zipline."

468,00:29:04.08,00:29:04.08,">> PROBST: Up the ladder! >> Come on, Nate."
469,00:29:07.17,00:29:07.17,"You're making great time, Nate! Come on, Nate!"
470,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50,">> You guys are doing great. Go, Yully!"
471,00:29:12.38,00:29:12.38,>> PROBST: Yul back with two bags of puzzle pieces.
472,00:29:16.67,00:29:16.67,Everybody's got to be up. Start on the puzzle.
473,00:29:21.96,00:29:21.96,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Aitu working on the
474,00:29:23.88,00:29:23.88,puzzle. Nate coming back for Raro.
475,00:29:26.12,00:29:26.12,>> Be ready! >> PROBST: Got to climb up the
476,00:29:28.33,00:29:28.33,"rope ladder. >> Go, go, go, go, go!"
477,00:29:34.38,00:29:34.38,>> PROBST: Raro back with the first bag.
478,00:29:37.62,00:29:37.62,Here's the second bag. Nate coming up with the third
479,00:29:41.62,00:29:41.62,bag. Start working on the puzzle.
480,00:29:48.67,00:29:48.67,">> No, this has to be right here."
481,00:29:51.88,00:29:51.88,>> PROBST: Aitu getting it together.
482,00:29:55.25,00:29:55.25,"Becky, Sundra, Jessica working well together."
483,00:29:58.17,00:29:58.17,Raro making good progress quickly.
484,00:30:01.88,00:30:01.88,">> Santa Maria, okay. >> PROBST: Adam, Jenny, Rebecca,"
485,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,working well on the puzzle. We're neck and neck on the
486,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,puzzle. It's going to come down to the
487,00:30:13.12,00:30:13.12,puzzle-building portion of this challenge.
488,00:30:16.33,00:30:16.33,Immunity on the line. Raro getting very close.
489,00:30:20.29,00:30:20.29,">> Here, here! Here!"
490,00:30:22.83,00:30:22.83,Here! Here!
491,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,">> PROBST: Raro wins immunity! >> PROBST: Raro,"
492,00:30:44.04,00:30:44.04,"congratulations. No tribal council tonight,"
493,00:30:47.00,00:30:47.00,"nobody going home. Aitu, not good news for you."
494,00:30:50.96,00:30:50.96,Tribal council tonight. One of you going home.
495,00:30:53.62,00:30:53.62,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
496,00:30:55.33,00:30:55.33,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you at tribal."
497,00:31:11.00,00:31:11.00,">> You know, it's a tough break. I mean, what are we going to do?"
498,00:31:13.08,00:31:13.08,"It's not like they handed us our asses, you know what I mean?"
499,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,It's not like the way we beat them the other day where it was
500,00:31:17.21,00:31:17.21,just ridiculous. It was just one of those things.
501,00:31:19.96,00:31:19.96,>> Challenge sucked. We lost.
502,00:31:23.75,00:31:23.75,I feel bummed out that someone has to go home.
503,00:31:27.08,00:31:27.08,"And if it ends up being me that goes home, that's how it"
504,00:31:29.25,00:31:29.25,happens. But I don't think it's going to
505,00:31:32.46,00:31:32.46,be me. I think it's going to be
506,00:31:34.29,00:31:34.29,somebody else. >> So have you thought about who
507,00:31:38.21,00:31:38.21,you would want to vote out if we end up having to?
508,00:31:40.25,00:31:40.25,>> I don't know. >> Honestly?
509,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,">> No, I don't know. It's just one of those things"
510,00:31:47.21,00:31:47.21,where Jonathan is the biggest threat for all of us.
511,00:31:51.00,00:31:51.00,">> There's been a debate between Jessica, Jonathan, and Ozzy who"
512,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,"we should send home first. You know, Ozzy does bring home a"
513,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,"lot of food, and he does perform really well in the challenges"
514,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,for us. Jessica drives people crazy just
515,00:32:03.21,00:32:03.21,"with, you know, the constant paranoia."
516,00:32:06.71,00:32:06.71,"And Jonathan, I think, is kind of on the cusp in our alliance,"
517,00:32:12.67,00:32:12.67,just because from the very beginning people said they don't
518,00:32:16.62,00:32:16.62,"trust him, they're not sure, blah, blah, blah."
519,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,">> She's trying to be everybody's friend right now,"
520,00:32:36.04,00:32:36.04,and I think Jessica is just covering her ass.
521,00:32:37.88,00:32:37.88,She was like a mosquito that won't die.
522,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,">> Ozzy, he's awesome in challenges, and I think today,"
523,00:33:13.42,00:33:13.42,"also, was a very important indicator, the fact that"
524,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,"Jonathan sat out today. You know, obviously, we lost,"
525,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,"but at the same time, in, like, the big picture, we didn't,"
526,00:33:21.29,00:33:21.29,"like, really need him, per se. So I thought that was also"
527,00:33:24.42,00:33:24.42,"brought up by Ozzy, saying that, you know, if we can all vote"
528,00:33:26.67,00:33:26.67,"against him in the sense of... you know, if none of us trust"
529,00:33:28.75,00:33:28.75,"him, why is he still here? >> That was the roughest it's"
530,00:33:35.79,00:33:35.79,been out there. Crazy.
531,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,Hi. >> I don't know if you're
532,00:33:42.08,00:33:42.08,"feeling the funky vibe in camp, but we are trying to get the"
533,00:33:44.42,00:33:44.42,"hell out. >> Oh, god."
534,00:33:47.08,00:33:47.08,"I felt bad. You know, I mean, it's... it's"
535,00:33:49.54,00:33:49.54,"the decision, you know? Do we think it's going to go one"
536,00:33:55.29,00:33:55.29,or two more challenges before the merge?
537,00:33:58.88,00:33:58.88,In which case it might make sense to keep Ozzy around.
538,00:34:03.25,00:34:03.25,"I mean, he really does do well in the challenges."
539,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,"You know, there's just no denying it."
540,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"And so maybe... maybe the choice is Flicka, and we'll just take"
541,00:34:13.08,00:34:13.08,"our chances in the individuals, you know?"
542,00:34:17.38,00:34:17.38,"For all my overthinking, yes, it my bite me in the butt."
543,00:34:21.25,00:34:21.25,"People already think that I'm thinking too much, playing too"
544,00:34:24.04,00:34:24.04,"much, or whatever. I'm trying to choose my battles"
545,00:34:27.62,00:34:27.62,carefully. I'm trying to stay one step
546,00:34:30.42,00:34:30.42,ahead of the competition. I may trip because I'm running
547,00:34:34.54,00:34:34.54,"too far, too fast ahead. All the girls agree that voting"
548,00:34:39.79,00:34:39.79,her off first is better. I can only play the game as best
549,00:34:42.83,00:34:42.83,"I can, make sense to me. And my feeling always is, if"
550,00:34:46.12,00:34:46.12,"I've thought of it, somebody else has thought of it."
551,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,>> I know that Jonathan for some reason seems to inspire some
552,00:35:12.33,00:35:12.33,level of mistrust among pretty much everybody.
553,00:35:17.42,00:35:17.42,"If you talk to anybody, including other people in our"
554,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,"alliance, they feel like he's a gamer."
555,00:35:21.17,00:35:21.17,"He's here to play hard, and people don't fully trust him."
556,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,"And for me, I haven't seen it, but because everyone else is"
557,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,"suspicious of him, I mean, it can't help but rub off on me a"
558,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,"little bit. >> Well, you guys, for what it"
559,00:35:34.92,00:35:34.92,"is, I thank you for being up front and honest with everything"
560,00:35:42.21,00:35:42.21,"today. As much as it's worth, you know,"
561,00:35:45.96,00:35:45.96,even though it's coming down and nobody really knows what they
562,00:35:48.29,00:35:48.29,"want to do, or whatever. I don't know for sure who is"
563,00:35:53.42,00:35:53.42,voting with me for Jonathan. I would like to say Ozzy is.
564,00:35:57.04,00:35:57.04,"I would like it say the girls are, and Yul, too."
565,00:36:01.62,00:36:01.62,"But I think they're just kind of like, ""I don't know what to do,"""
566,00:36:03.88,00:36:03.88,"because, you know, any of us can go."
567,00:36:28.62,00:36:28.62,">> PROBST: Jonathan, when we started this game 18 days ago,"
568,00:36:31.58,00:36:31.58,you were divided into groups based on ethnicity.
569,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,Look at this group tonight. At least one member from all
570,00:36:37.71,00:36:37.71,"four of the original ethnic groups, and yet I don't have any"
571,00:36:40.46,00:36:40.46,sense that that plays any part in this tribe.
572,00:36:44.04,00:36:44.04,Surprise you? >> No.
573,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,I think it's the game of Survivor.
574,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,We're all here to play it. You divided us into four equal
575,00:36:52.12,00:36:52.12,groups. We made the connections that we
576,00:36:54.62,00:36:54.62,made. We were merged into two other
577,00:36:56.83,00:36:56.83,tribes. And all those connections have
578,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,"either held or gone away based on personality, not ethnicity."
579,00:37:03.29,00:37:03.29,">> PROBST: Sundra, is it true that there's just a natural way"
580,00:37:06.04,00:37:06.04,you tend to bond with certain people and maybe not bond with
581,00:37:08.54,00:37:08.54,others? >> Absolutely.
582,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,You can't plan who you're going to bond with.
583,00:37:13.04,00:37:13.04,"It's nothing calculated or planned, and there are certain"
584,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,"people, their personalities, you're just not going to gel."
585,00:37:18.71,00:37:18.71,"You can force it, but it's going to be more work than with"
586,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,somebody who you just find a natural chemistry with.
587,00:37:24.42,00:37:24.42,"And for those you may not get along as well with, you try to"
588,00:37:29.08,00:37:29.08,"find a common ground, you know, whatever it may be."
589,00:37:31.46,00:37:31.46,">> PROBST: Jessica, let's talk about who gets along with whom."
590,00:37:35.33,00:37:35.33,">> Just in general, we all get along with each other."
591,00:37:38.62,00:37:38.62,"But, I mean, we all have, like, friendships, you know, that we"
592,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,hang out a lot. I like to go out fishing with
593,00:37:45.08,00:37:45.08,"Ozzy and, you know, the girls do the things in camp."
594,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"You know, Jonathan and Yul, they like to go out clamming."
595,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,"We all kind of picked our roles a little bit, but we switched"
596,00:37:54.08,00:37:54.08,"things up a lot, too. So I think all of us are capable"
597,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,of mixing and matching and having fun.
598,00:38:00.71,00:38:00.71,">> PROBST: Yul, from a strictly strategic point of view, every"
599,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,time I've asked Jessica a question it's been the most
600,00:38:06.25,00:38:06.25,delightful answer with absolutely nothing said about
601,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,how it would impact the game. >> It's nice to have someone
602,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,like that because they're not going to be a threat.
603,00:38:14.75,00:38:14.75,They're not going to be someone who's going to be undermining
604,00:38:16.58,00:38:16.58,"you, outscheming you, out to get you or stab you in the back."
605,00:38:18.92,00:38:18.92,"So, you know, they're someone who you can take at face value."
606,00:38:22.12,00:38:22.12,"And as long as you can form a bond with them, they're not"
607,00:38:24.17,00:38:24.17,to be someone you're going to have to watch out for in the
608,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,"future. >> PROBST: Ozzy, it's been"
609,00:38:29.50,00:38:29.50,brought up a lot that you're a provider.
610,00:38:31.46,00:38:31.46,"Is there a point in the game where you provide too much,"
611,00:38:34.08,00:38:34.08,"where you become a threat? >> God, I hope not."
612,00:38:37.71,00:38:37.71,I hope I can make everyone fat. I've never been in a position of
613,00:38:40.88,00:38:40.88,"being the hunter, and that's kind of nice to know that I hold"
614,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,that little bit of responsibility in my hand.
615,00:38:49.79,00:38:49.79,"And, you know, if that ends up being my demise, then that's"
616,00:38:55.12,00:38:55.12,probably the best way that I could see to go out in this
617,00:38:57.38,00:38:57.38,"game. >> PROBST: Okay, if somebody"
618,00:38:59.38,00:38:59.38,"does have the hidden immunity idol, and it turns out you need"
619,00:39:01.71,00:39:01.71,"to play it, you would present it to me after the vote."
620,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,"You would then be immune, and the person with the next highest"
621,00:39:07.88,00:39:07.88,number of votes would be sent home.
622,00:39:10.17,00:39:10.17,"It is time to vote. Ozzy, you're up."
623,00:39:23.54,00:39:23.54,">> I really admire your spirit, and I think with another group"
624,00:39:27.00,00:39:27.00,of people you would have felt more comfortable.
625,00:39:29.04,00:39:29.04,"Good luck. >> I didn't trust you before,"
626,00:39:45.88,00:39:45.88,and I'm not going to start now. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
627,00:40:03.46,00:40:03.46,"votes. Once the vote are read, the"
628,00:40:14.25,00:40:14.25,decision is final. The person voted out will be
629,00:40:16.29,00:40:16.29,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
630,00:40:18.33,00:40:18.33,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Jonathan."
631,00:40:26.04,00:40:26.04,"Flicka. One vote Jessica, one vote"
632,00:40:30.04,00:40:30.04,Jonathan. Jessica.
633,00:40:34.33,00:40:34.33,"Two votes Jessica, one vote Jonathan."
634,00:40:39.88,00:40:39.88,"Jessica. That's three votes Jessica, one"
635,00:40:42.17,00:40:42.17,vote Jonathan. Eighth person voted out of the
636,00:40:48.29,00:40:48.29,"Cook Islands, Jessica. That's four."
637,00:40:51.25,00:40:51.25,That's enough. Unless you have the hidden
638,00:40:52.96,00:40:52.96,"immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch."
639,00:41:01.25,00:41:01.25,"Jessica, the tribe has spoken. >> Thank you."
640,00:41:04.38,00:41:04.38,">> PROBST: Time for you to go. Well, after 18 days, we have two"
641,00:41:18.96,00:41:18.96,"tribes, each with six members. And the big question centers"
642,00:41:23.33,00:41:23.33,around momentum. You think you have it.
643,00:41:26.17,00:41:26.17,I guarantee you Raro thinks they have it.
644,00:41:28.12,00:41:28.12,"Time will tell. Grab your torches, head back to"
645,00:41:29.96,00:41:29.96,camp. Good night.

654,00:41:58.75,00:41:58.75,with Brad. I lost my trust with him.

659,00:42:17.12,00:42:17.12,asked for anything more. I guess I wasn't playing the
660,00:42:19.92,00:42:19.92,"game as hard as I should have, but it's really hard for me to"
661,00:42:23.00,00:42:23.00,change who I am when I just want to be myself.
662,00:42:25.17,00:42:25.17,"Ozzy, good luck. I'll be rooting for you,"
663,00:42:27.54,00:42:27.54,brother. And memories have been made that
664,00:42:28.71,00:42:28.71,"I will never forget, and I'm so thankful for those experiences."
