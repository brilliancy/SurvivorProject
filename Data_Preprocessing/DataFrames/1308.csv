524,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,"but at the same time, in, like,the big picture, we didn't,"
525,00:33:21.29,00:33:21.29,"like, really need him, per se.So I thought that was also"
526,00:33:24.42,00:33:24.42,"brought up by Ozzy, saying that,you know, if we can all vote"
527,00:33:26.67,00:33:26.67,"against him in the sense of...you know, if none of us trust"
528,00:33:28.75,00:33:28.75,"him, why is he still here?>> That was the roughest it's"

534,00:33:49.54,00:33:49.54,"the decision, you know?Do we think it's going to go one"
535,00:33:55.29,00:33:55.29,or two more challenges beforethe merge?
536,00:33:58.88,00:33:58.88,In which case it might makesense to keep Ozzy around.
537,00:34:03.25,00:34:03.25,"I mean, he really does do wellin the challenges."
538,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,"You know, there's just nodenying it."
539,00:34:07.92,00:34:07.92,"And so maybe... maybe the choiceis Flicka, and we'll just take"

545,00:34:30.42,00:34:30.42,ahead of the competition.I may trip because I'm running
546,00:34:34.54,00:34:34.54,"too far, too fast ahead.All the girls agree that voting"
547,00:34:39.79,00:34:39.79,her off first is better.I can only play the game as best
548,00:34:42.83,00:34:42.83,"I can, make sense to me.And my feeling always is, if"
549,00:34:46.12,00:34:46.12,"I've thought of it, somebodyelse has thought of it."
550,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,>> I know that Jonathan for somereason seems to inspire some

555,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,"And for me, I haven't seen it,but because everyone else is"

562,00:35:53.42,00:35:53.42,voting with me for Jonathan.I would like to say Ozzy is.

564,00:36:01.62,00:36:01.62,"But I think they're just kind oflike, ""I don't know what to do,"""
565,00:36:03.88,00:36:03.88,"because, you know, any of us cango."

567,00:36:31.58,00:36:31.58,you were divided into groupsbased on ethnicity.
568,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,Look at this group tonight.At least one member from all
569,00:36:37.71,00:36:37.71,"four of the original ethnicgroups, and yet I don't have any"
570,00:36:40.46,00:36:40.46,sense that that plays any partin this tribe.
571,00:36:44.04,00:36:44.04,Surprise you?>> No.
572,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,I think it's the gameof Survivor.
573,00:36:49.67,00:36:49.67,We're all here to play it.You divided us into four equal
574,00:36:52.12,00:36:52.12,groups.We made the connections that we
575,00:36:54.62,00:36:54.62,made.We were merged into two other
576,00:36:56.83,00:36:56.83,tribes.And all those connections have
577,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,"either held or gone away basedon personality, not ethnicity."

581,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,You can't plan who you're goingto bond with.
582,00:37:13.04,00:37:13.04,"It's nothing calculated orplanned, and there are certain"
583,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,"people, their personalities,you're just not going to gel."
584,00:37:18.71,00:37:18.71,"You can force it, but it's goingto be more work than with"
585,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,somebody who you just find anatural chemistry with.
586,00:37:24.42,00:37:24.42,"And for those you may not getalong as well with, you try to"
587,00:37:29.08,00:37:29.08,"find a common ground, you know,whatever it may be."

590,00:37:38.62,00:37:38.62,"But, I mean, we all have, like,friendships, you know, that we"
591,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,hang out a lot.I like to go out fishing with
592,00:37:45.08,00:37:45.08,"Ozzy and, you know, the girls dothe things in camp."
593,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"You know, Jonathan and Yul, theylike to go out clamming."
594,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,"We all kind of picked our rolesa little bit, but we switched"
595,00:37:54.08,00:37:54.08,"things up a lot, too.So I think all of us are capable"
596,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,of mixing and matching andhaving fun.
597,00:38:00.71,00:38:00.71,">> PROBST: Yul, from a strictlystrategic point of view, every"
598,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,time I've asked Jessica aquestion it's been the most
599,00:38:06.25,00:38:06.25,delightful answer withabsolutely nothing said about
600,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,how it would impact the game.>> It's nice to have someone
601,00:38:13.00,00:38:13.00,like that because they're notgoing to be a threat.
602,00:38:14.75,00:38:14.75,They're not going to be someonewho's going to be undermining
603,00:38:16.58,00:38:16.58,"you, outscheming you, out to getyou or stab you in the back."
604,00:38:18.92,00:38:18.92,"So, you know, they're someonewho you can take at face value."
605,00:38:22.12,00:38:22.12,"And as long as you can form abond with them, they're not"
606,00:38:24.17,00:38:24.17,to be someone you're going tohave to watch out for in the
607,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,"future.>> PROBST: Ozzy, it's been"
608,00:38:29.50,00:38:29.50,brought up a lot that you're aprovider.
609,00:38:31.46,00:38:31.46,"Is there a point in the gamewhere you provide too much,"
610,00:38:34.08,00:38:34.08,"where you become a threat?>> God, I hope not."
611,00:38:37.71,00:38:37.71,I hope I can make everyone fat.I've never been in a position of
612,00:38:40.88,00:38:40.88,"being the hunter, and that'skind of nice to know that I hold"
613,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,that little bit ofresponsibility in my hand.
614,00:38:49.79,00:38:49.79,"And, you know, if that ends upbeing my demise, then that's"
615,00:38:55.12,00:38:55.12,probably the best way that Icould see to go out in this
