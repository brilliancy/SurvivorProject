377,00:25:19.50,00:25:19.50,"Immunity, it's back up forgrabs."
378,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,"For today's immunity challenge,you're going to have to test"
379,00:25:24.88,00:25:24.88,"your balance, your teamwork,and your patience."
380,00:25:28.25,00:25:28.25,"Here's how it works: one personwill begin seated on a chair,"
381,00:25:32.42,00:25:32.42,which is attached to a pulley.Another person will be situated
382,00:25:35.17,00:25:35.17,directly above them in a crow'snest where an empty water drum
383,00:25:38.79,00:25:38.79,hangs.The other four remaining tribe
384,00:25:41.04,00:25:41.04,members will be tied togetherin pairs.
385,00:25:43.58,00:25:43.58,You'll race across a balancebeam carrying buckets.
386,00:25:46.25,00:25:46.25,"Once you reach the water, dipyour bucket in, get water, and"
387,00:25:48.88,00:25:48.88,race back.You'll then empty your water
388,00:25:51.12,00:25:51.12,into a larger pail.The person in the crow's nest
389,00:25:53.67,00:25:53.67,"will pull that pail up, emptythe water into the drum."
390,00:25:57.50,00:25:57.50,"As the drum takes on water, itwill lower."
391,00:26:00.62,00:26:00.62,The person in the chair willrise until they're high enough
392,00:26:03.46,00:26:03.46,"to pull the pin, releasing thetribe flag."
393,00:26:06.46,00:26:06.46,"First tribe to release theirflag wins immunity, is safe"

395,00:26:13.96,00:26:13.96,going home.One big rule: if you fall off

552,00:34:15.50,00:34:15.50,"I know you made a promise, andyour word is your bond, and, uh,"
553,00:34:18.58,00:34:18.58,that's fine.But I'm looking at getting us
554,00:34:22.04,00:34:22.04,"four intact to the merge, and,uh, the strongest way possible"
555,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,"is to have the strongest player,I think, which is Sally."
556,00:34:30.62,00:34:30.62,>> I just can't believe howquickly it falls apart.

560,00:34:42.50,00:34:42.50,change horses midstream is a bigmistake.
561,00:34:45.46,00:34:45.46,It's crazy.Be aware.
562,00:34:48.92,00:34:48.92,"If we take out Ruth tonight,we're down to four anyway,"
563,00:34:51.04,00:34:51.04,'cause Sally is going to jumpship.
564,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,I don't care what she says.She'll say anything right now.
