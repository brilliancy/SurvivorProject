12,00:00:25.71,00:00:25.71,And fire! Terry once again dominated.
13,00:00:28.75,00:00:28.75,Terry makes an unbelievable catch!
14,00:00:31.88,00:00:31.88,"La Mina wins reward! This time, the winners had to"
15,00:00:36.17,00:00:36.17,send someone from the losing tribe to Exile Island.
16,00:00:42.50,00:00:42.50,Who are you sending? >> Bruce.
17,00:00:44.54,00:00:44.54,We're sending him back. >> PROBST: And Bruce was
18,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17,banished for the second time in a row.
19,00:00:48.33,00:00:48.33,">> Those guys are playing for keeps, huh?"
20,00:00:50.50,00:00:50.50,">> PROBST: La Mina's new tarp kept them warm and dry, but"
21,00:00:55.58,00:00:55.58,"Bruce didn't fare so well. At Casaya, Shane, Courtney,"
22,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,Aras and Danielle's alliance was strained.
23,00:01:06.04,00:01:06.04,">> You're out of your mind, man. You are crazy."
24,00:01:08.50,00:01:08.50,>> These are the people that you guys decided to align with.
25,00:01:12.04,00:01:12.04,How stupid is that? >> I want one!
26,00:01:14.58,00:01:14.58,This one! I just want mine!
27,00:01:17.17,00:01:17.17,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Bruce rejoined his"
28,00:01:20.46,00:01:20.46,"tribe for one of the most brutal challenges yet, and Casaya"
29,00:01:25.25,00:01:25.25,battled their way to victory. (cheering)
30,00:01:29.08,00:01:29.08,"Back at La Mina, Dan and Terry schemed with Austin and Nick."
31,00:01:32.62,00:01:32.62,">> Dan and I, as soon as we got the two younger guys, we got on"
32,00:01:36.12,00:01:36.12,"them quickly, and the plan at Tribal Council tonight is to"
33,00:01:39.12,00:01:39.12,vote off Misty. >> PROBST: But Misty and Sally
34,00:01:41.83,00:01:41.83,had other plans. >> Ruth Marie is pretty weak
35,00:01:43.88,00:01:43.88,right now. >> Could you vote for Ruth
36,00:01:46.96,00:01:46.96,Marie? >> PROBST: So Austin and Nick
37,00:01:49.00,00:01:49.00,had a tough choice to make. >> We could either go with Sally
38,00:01:53.25,00:01:53.25,"and Misty or Dan and Terry. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
39,00:01:58.62,00:01:58.62,"the men came together... >> Tonight, I'm going with the"
40,00:02:00.96,00:02:00.96,group. >> PROBST: ...and Misty became
41,00:02:02.83,00:02:02.83,"the third person voted out. Misty, the tribe has spoken."
42,00:02:08.67,00:02:08.67,13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?

47,00:03:40.12,00:03:40.12,"Council and Misty was voted out, and the guys had said that the"
48,00:03:44.17,00:03:44.17,"vote was going to be for Ruth Marie, so it seems I was the odd"
49,00:03:47.83,00:03:47.83,woman out and it kind of isolated me from the rest of the
50,00:03:51.04,00:03:51.04,group. Is there anything that you guys
51,00:03:52.88,00:03:52.88,need? >> We're going to need some
52,00:03:54.12,00:03:54.12,wood. >> There are some big boys in
53,00:03:56.08,00:03:56.08,"that camp that are calling a lot of the shots, and all I can do"
54,00:03:59.46,00:03:59.46,right now is keep working hard and prove myself valuable.
55,00:04:05.00,00:04:05.00,>> We need to talk a little bit. >> All right.
56,00:04:10.29,00:04:10.29,>> Me and Terry and Nick and Austin and you.
57,00:04:14.25,00:04:14.25,>> Thank you. >> What do you think?
58,00:04:15.79,00:04:15.79,>> Yeah. >> All right.
59,00:04:18.29,00:04:18.29,I've been thinking a lot about who should be the fifth person
60,00:04:21.04,00:04:21.04,"to take to the merge, and I thought that Ruth Marie was the"
61,00:04:24.54,00:04:24.54,"one to go with. >> Well, I'm totally"
62,00:04:29.88,00:04:29.88,"appreciative and I'm loyal. >> Yeah, well, that's why you're"
63,00:04:33.79,00:04:33.79,here. I don't think Sally feels like a
64,00:04:36.38,00:04:36.38,"part of this team, and I think when a merge comes, Sally will"
65,00:04:40.04,00:04:40.04,"drop us like a stone, but with Ruth Marie, I think she'll stay"
66,00:04:45.29,00:04:45.29,with that group of five all the way to the end.
67,00:04:50.62,00:04:50.62,>> All right. We have the numbers here.
68,00:04:54.75,00:04:54.75,"We got the four guys and stuff, and we're all four strong guys."
69,00:04:57.92,00:04:57.92,">> Yeah, but when the tribes merge, we need a fifth."
70,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,>> Right. >> And Dan suggested that it
71,00:05:01.67,00:05:01.67,would be Ruth Marie. >> You know what?
72,00:05:04.38,00:05:04.38,"That's fine, that's fine. We've got a really strong"
73,00:05:07.42,00:05:07.42,alliance of the four guys and kind of a fifth right now is
74,00:05:12.25,00:05:12.25,Ruth Marie. >> I'm pretty confident with the
75,00:05:15.08,00:05:15.08,alliance that we have. Everybody has shaken hands on it
76,00:05:18.17,00:05:18.17,"and looked each other in the eye, so I have a good feeling"
77,00:05:21.46,00:05:21.46,that we have an alliance that will make it to the merge.
78,00:05:33.42,00:05:33.42,>> That one. I got a good one.
79,00:05:36.88,00:05:36.88,>> There are some big ones there.
80,00:05:38.33,00:05:38.33,">> The sun comes out. Shane, myself and Bruce went"
81,00:05:41.04,00:05:41.04,and got snails. We got pounds of snails.
82,00:05:44.67,00:05:44.67,">> Ready to go back in? >> As we're walking back, we"
83,00:05:47.29,00:05:47.29,"look over and we see Courtney, and the problem is that I think"
84,00:05:51.25,00:05:51.25,some people on this tribe don't realize exactly what being on an
85,00:05:54.88,00:05:54.88,island by yourself means. We haven't eaten today yet.
86,00:06:01.71,00:06:01.71,">> Hello, ladies. >> You guys boil a pot of snails"
87,00:06:05.08,00:06:05.08,"already? >> Where's ""D"" at?"
88,00:06:09.67,00:06:09.67,>> How is the fish? Sleeping.
89,00:06:11.38,00:06:11.38,How is the fish? >> We got to talk about...
90,00:06:23.38,00:06:23.38,>> Work. >> ...effort at camp.
91,00:06:27.08,00:06:27.08,>> We came back with two bags of snails and the fire was like...
92,00:06:32.08,00:06:32.08,"And nothing was ready, and Shane and Aras, they'd just had it."
93,00:06:37.12,00:06:37.12,">> Yo, Bob, Danielle. >> What?"
94,00:06:39.54,00:06:39.54,>> We all want to have a talk about camp responsibilities.
95,00:06:43.50,00:06:43.50,We can't be out catching food for a whole day and then the
96,00:06:47.04,00:06:47.04,"onus of fire is on us. >> Honestly, that kills me to"
97,00:06:50.62,00:06:50.62,"hear that because I'm constantly working, so I don't know."
98,00:06:59.29,00:06:59.29,I think the whole question is kind of stupid.
99,00:07:04.25,00:07:04.25,">> Shane, Courtney and Danielle-- I gave those people"
100,00:07:06.83,00:07:06.83,"my word in the alliance, but if I had my druthers, I wouldn't"
101,00:07:09.79,00:07:09.79,want to be in the alliance with Courtney.
102,00:07:11.62,00:07:11.62,I would almost lose it on purpose to get Courtney voted
103,00:07:14.21,00:07:14.21,off because she just gets on my nerves.
104,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,">> When we're eating, can we agree not to argue?"
105,00:07:19.12,00:07:19.12,>> I didn't do anything. >> No arguing during dinner.
106,00:07:22.38,00:07:22.38,">> Things were planned and alliances were made, and I was"
107,00:07:26.12,00:07:26.12,"told that I would be the one to go after Melinda, but it's just"
108,00:07:30.88,00:07:30.88,"constant, constant drama. I love it, love it, love it."
109,00:07:33.83,00:07:33.83,Yes! So my strategy right now is kind
110,00:07:37.88,00:07:37.88,of just continue to work like I've been working and stay out
111,00:07:41.54,00:07:41.54,"of the drama. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
112,00:07:55.92,00:07:55.92,"Casaya, getting your first look at the new La Mina tribe."
113,00:08:00.79,00:08:00.79,Misty voted out last Tribal Council.
114,00:08:05.71,00:08:05.71,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?"
115,00:08:08.08,00:08:08.08,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Here's how it works:
116,00:08:10.71,00:08:10.71,each tribe has six floating puzzle pieces.
117,00:08:14.21,00:08:14.21,"On my ""go,"" one tribe member at a time will swim out, dive down,"
118,00:08:18.38,00:08:18.38,"unclip a puzzle piece, and bring it back to the puzzle frame."
119,00:08:21.71,00:08:21.71,"Once you have the piece in the puzzle frame, the next person"
120,00:08:25.08,00:08:25.08,goes out. Once you've collected all six of
121,00:08:28.08,00:08:28.08,"the pieces you need, you can start assembling the puzzle by"
122,00:08:31.25,00:08:31.25,matching the corresponding symbols on each side of every
123,00:08:36.12,00:08:36.12,piece of the puzzle. The first tribe to get it
124,00:08:38.46,00:08:38.46,together correctly wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
125,00:08:41.00,00:08:41.00,for? >> Yeah.
126,00:08:42.04,00:08:42.04,>> PROBST: Today you are playing for a full-on Survivor bathroom.
127,00:08:46.50,00:08:46.50,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: Towels, loofah, some"
128,00:08:50.71,00:08:50.71,"soap, plenty of Charmin. >> That's great."
129,00:08:54.25,00:08:54.25,>> PROBST: Hopefully help take the edge off.
130,00:08:56.62,00:08:56.62,"You'll have a sink, you'll have a toilet seat, you'll have a"
131,00:08:59.08,00:08:59.08,bush shower. You'll have five gallons of
132,00:09:01.71,00:09:01.71,"fresh water. ""Casa de Charmin"" will be"
133,00:09:04.92,00:09:04.92,delivered to the camp who wins this challenge.
134,00:09:08.00,00:09:08.00,"For the losers, one person will be sent from here to Exile"
135,00:09:12.92,00:09:12.92,Island where they will remain until the next immunity
136,00:09:15.25,00:09:15.25,challenge. Make sense?
137,00:09:17.25,00:09:17.25,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Let's swim out, we'll"
138,00:09:18.54,00:09:18.54,get started. Here we go.
139,00:09:22.04,00:09:22.04,For reward. Survivors ready?
140,00:09:25.42,00:09:25.42,Go! Sally and Bobby in the water.
141,00:09:30.25,00:09:30.25,Looking for six pieces. Bobby at the first piece.
142,00:09:35.71,00:09:35.71,Sally going for the first piece. Bobby goes down to unclip.
143,00:09:43.04,00:09:43.04,Sally has hers. Bobby has his.
144,00:09:48.08,00:09:48.08,La Mina pulling ahead. The hard part of this is getting
145,00:09:51.08,00:09:51.08,the muscle to get it in the ring.
146,00:09:52.67,00:09:52.67,">> There you go, there you go, come on."
147,00:09:54.00,00:09:54.00,>> PROBST: You got to muscle it up and inside that puzzle ring.
148,00:09:56.67,00:09:56.67,">> Legs, legs, legs! >> PROBST: Sally with a great"
149,00:09:58.83,00:09:58.83,"strategy. >> Pull it, Bob!"
150,00:10:00.50,00:10:00.50,>> PROBST: Bobby can't get it in the ring.
151,00:10:02.54,00:10:02.54,You got to get it in the ring before you can move on.
152,00:10:05.71,00:10:05.71,"Go, La Mina! Bobby losing time for Casaya."
153,00:10:11.21,00:10:11.21,"Go, Casaya! Bruce in the water."
154,00:10:14.54,00:10:14.54,"Dan goes down to unclip. >> You got it, Bruce!"
155,00:10:20.96,00:10:20.96,>> PROBST: Dan has his unclipped.
156,00:10:23.54,00:10:23.54,">> Come on, Dan! >> PROBST: Dan back with the"

159,00:10:29.83,00:10:29.83,"Come on, now, Bruce. >> PROBST: Got to get it in the"
160,00:10:31.46,00:10:31.46,ring. >> Go!

166,00:10:46.46,00:10:46.46,"get that in the puzzle ring. >> Good job, good job."
167,00:10:48.54,00:10:48.54,>> PROBST: Got to get it all the way in.
168,00:10:50.79,00:10:50.79,Danielle making up a lot of time for Casaya.
169,00:10:53.29,00:10:53.29,"Got to get it all the way, La Mina."
170,00:10:56.04,00:10:56.04,"Go, La Mina! Nick in the water for La Mina."
171,00:10:59.75,00:10:59.75,"Shane, go for Casaya! We're neck and neck."
172,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,"Both tribes with three pieces. Nick, back quickly with a piece."
173,00:11:11.21,00:11:11.21,"Shane, back quickly with a piece for Casaya."
174,00:11:13.75,00:11:13.75,We're neck-and-neck-- Nick and Shane.
175,00:11:16.21,00:11:16.21,"Gotta get it inside the puzzle. Go, La Mina."
176,00:11:20.96,00:11:20.96,"Austin in the water for La Mina. Shane's gotta get it in, the"

180,00:11:37.71,00:11:37.71,We're neck and neck again. Austin back with the fifth piece
181,00:11:43.04,00:11:43.04,for La Mina. Courtney back with the fifth
182,00:11:45.08,00:11:45.08,piece for Casaya. Can't start solving the puzzle
183,00:11:48.25,00:11:48.25,"until all six pieces are in. Gotta get it in, Austin."
184,00:11:52.46,00:11:52.46,You're not in. Austin thought he had it.
185,00:11:55.92,00:11:55.92,"Go, Casaya. Austin lost some time for La"
186,00:11:58.67,00:11:58.67,Mina. Terry in for La Mina.

370,00:24:57.04,00:24:57.04,Island. Misty was voted out.
371,00:24:59.46,00:24:59.46,She obviously didn't have it. Bruce and Terry are the only
372,00:25:02.71,00:25:02.71,two people who have been there. They may have found it.
373,00:25:05.17,00:25:05.17,It may still be up for grabs. Certainly a valuable item
374,00:25:08.08,00:25:08.08,either way. You guys ready to get to

379,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,"For today's immunity challenge, you're going to have to test"
380,00:25:24.88,00:25:24.88,"your balance, your teamwork, and your patience."
381,00:25:28.25,00:25:28.25,"Here's how it works: one person will begin seated on a chair,"
382,00:25:32.42,00:25:32.42,which is attached to a pulley. Another person will be situated
383,00:25:35.17,00:25:35.17,directly above them in a crow's nest where an empty water drum
384,00:25:38.79,00:25:38.79,hangs. The other four remaining tribe
385,00:25:41.04,00:25:41.04,members will be tied together in pairs.
386,00:25:43.58,00:25:43.58,You'll race across a balance beam carrying buckets.
387,00:25:46.25,00:25:46.25,"Once you reach the water, dip your bucket in, get water, and"
388,00:25:48.88,00:25:48.88,race back. You'll then empty your water
389,00:25:51.12,00:25:51.12,into a larger pail. The person in the crow's nest
390,00:25:53.67,00:25:53.67,"will pull that pail up, empty the water into the drum."
391,00:25:57.50,00:25:57.50,"As the drum takes on water, it will lower."
392,00:26:00.62,00:26:00.62,The person in the chair will rise until they're high enough
393,00:26:03.46,00:26:03.46,"to pull the pin, releasing the tribe flag."
394,00:26:06.46,00:26:06.46,"First tribe to release their flag wins immunity, is safe"
395,00:26:10.29,00:26:10.29,"from Tribal Council. Losers, another person will be"
396,00:26:13.96,00:26:13.96,going home. One big rule: if you fall off
397,00:26:16.67,00:26:16.67,"the balance beam at any point, you lose all of your water in"
398,00:26:20.83,00:26:20.83,your buckets and go back to the start.
399,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,"Casaya, you have one extra member."
400,00:26:24.12,00:26:24.12,You're sitting somebody out. You cannot sit out the same
401,00:26:26.62,00:26:26.62,person in back-to-back challenges.
402,00:26:28.75,00:26:28.75,>> Bob-dog. >> PROBST: Bob-dog sitting
403,00:26:30.25,00:26:30.25,this one out? All right.
404,00:26:31.38,00:26:31.38,Give you a minute to strategize and we'll go.
405,00:26:34.58,00:26:34.58,"All right, pairs for Casaya are Shane and Courtney, Bruce"
406,00:26:38.04,00:26:38.04,"and Aras. For La Mina, Sally and Austin,"

409,00:26:48.54,00:26:48.54,"Go! >> Let's go, come on, let's go,"

441,00:28:15.58,00:28:15.58,with more water. Get it in the pail and pull it
442,00:28:17.92,00:28:17.92,up. Sally and Austin get the right
443,00:28:19.83,00:28:19.83,"of way this time. >> Slow and steady, fellas."

473,00:29:50.04,00:29:50.04,Will this be enough water? Right of way goes to Sally and
474,00:29:55.38,00:29:55.38,Austin. They're flying over this course.
475,00:29:58.00,00:29:58.00,Sally and Austin with a little bit of a lead over Shane and
476,00:30:01.21,00:30:01.21,Courtney. Will it be enough water?
477,00:30:03.58,00:30:03.58,Got to get it into that pail and get it up into the drum.
478,00:30:06.50,00:30:06.50,">> Come on, come on, come on! >> Go fast!"

484,00:30:25.17,00:30:25.17,It might be. >> Come on!

492,00:30:56.50,00:30:56.50,Somebody else going home. You have the afternoon to
493,00:30:58.50,00:30:58.50,figure out who that's going to be.
494,00:31:00.12,00:31:00.12,"Get your stuff, head on back, I'll see you at Tribal."

498,00:31:33.75,00:31:33.75,comforting to have somebody come in and just take over
499,00:31:38.12,00:31:38.12,again. It was fabulous.
500,00:31:39.62,00:31:39.62,>> Did they give you one clue or did they give you everybody's
501,00:31:42.21,00:31:42.21,clue up till now? >> Everybody's clue up till now.
502,00:31:44.04,00:31:44.04,Where to try to find it and everything.
503,00:31:45.83,00:31:45.83,It was a bear. >> How much time did you spend
504,00:31:47.92,00:31:47.92,"looking? >> Maybe I looked, uh, two hours"
505,00:31:50.46,00:31:50.46,or something. >> We talked about my two days
506,00:31:54.58,00:31:54.58,"on Exile Island, but nobody has directly asked me, ""Did you"

508,00:32:01.08,00:32:01.08,immunity idol. I want to have that in my back
509,00:32:04.71,00:32:04.71,pocket in case I need it down the road. 
510,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,">> I hate losing, guys. >> I know we did our best."
511,00:32:11.92,00:32:11.92,>> We lost the immunity challenge.
512,00:32:13.79,00:32:13.79,That sends us to Tribal Council. Not happy about going there
513,00:32:17.92,00:32:17.92,tonight. I don't think there's any way
514,00:32:19.62,00:32:19.62,around the fact that we're going to be voting out Sally.
515,00:32:21.46,00:32:21.46,">> All right, here's the deal. I just want to tell you,"
516,00:32:23.96,00:32:23.96,"whatever happens tonight, I respect you both."
517,00:32:27.04,00:32:27.04,"I know there's an alliance, but I do have a lot of game left in"
518,00:32:29.88,00:32:29.88,me. >> We know you do.
519,00:32:31.83,00:32:31.83,">> And I'd like to be here tomorrow, so that's all I have"
520,00:32:34.71,00:32:34.71,to say about that. I went up to Terry and just
521,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,"said, ""You know, I proved myself at the challenge today,"
522,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,"and I feel like I still deserve to be here."""
523,00:32:43.79,00:32:43.79,"All right, well, we're going to go get some water."
524,00:32:45.79,00:32:45.79,Who knows if that will sway anything?
525,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,"Terry calls the shots around here, and if he doesn't think"
526,00:32:50.67,00:32:50.67,"I'm worth keeping around, then I'm gone tonight."
527,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,>> I know. I'm thinking about our tribe
528,00:32:59.88,00:32:59.88,"here, man, because before we know it, it's going to be down"
529,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67,to the four of us. We don't want to go in four
530,00:33:03.50,00:33:03.50,people at the merge. We're going to get picked off
531,00:33:05.38,00:33:05.38,"one by one, you first. You've got the biggest target on"
532,00:33:07.21,00:33:07.21,your back of anybody on this whole beach.
533,00:33:17.88,00:33:17.88,>> Shane's a good athlete. He's better than I thought he
534,00:33:20.04,00:33:20.04,"was. >> Yeah, there's definitely a"
535,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,lot more than meets the eye with the Shane dog.
536,00:33:23.58,00:33:23.58,">> Oh, yeah. >> Oh."
537,00:33:26.46,00:33:26.46,"But here's the thing. You never promised Ruth Marie,"
538,00:33:29.33,00:33:29.33,I never promised her. Nor did Nick.
539,00:33:31.83,00:33:31.83,">> Mm-hmm. >> Yeah, Dan just gave his word,"
540,00:33:34.62,00:33:34.62,shook his hand. We never made that pact with
541,00:33:36.54,00:33:36.54,her. >> Austin came up to me and
542,00:33:39.83,00:33:39.83,pitched voting off Ruth Marie instead of Sally.
543,00:33:42.96,00:33:42.96,"Ruth Marie was given a promise and a handshake by Dan alone,"
544,00:33:46.83,00:33:46.83,"but since then, some things have changed."
545,00:33:49.38,00:33:49.38,"My goal was to come into the merge with numbers, and it's not"
546,00:33:52.58,00:33:52.58,looking good right now. >> What do you think?
547,00:33:54.62,00:33:54.62,>> Okay. >> You are?
548,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,>> Cool. I thought it was going to take
549,00:34:01.21,00:34:01.21,a water-into-wine type of miracle to pull Terry into
550,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,"keeping Sally as our fifth. Apparently, I got some Jesus of"
551,00:34:07.33,00:34:07.33,Nazareth-like powers myself. >> I know how you gave Ruth
552,00:34:11.71,00:34:11.71,"Marie a handshake, but neither one of us did."
553,00:34:15.50,00:34:15.50,"I know you made a promise, and your word is your bond, and, uh,"
554,00:34:18.58,00:34:18.58,that's fine. But I'm looking at getting us
555,00:34:22.04,00:34:22.04,"four intact to the merge, and, uh, the strongest way possible"
556,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,"is to have the strongest player, I think, which is Sally."
557,00:34:30.62,00:34:30.62,>> I just can't believe how quickly it falls apart.
558,00:34:33.25,00:34:33.25,"Austin and Terry-- they're saying now, ""You had the"
559,00:34:36.25,00:34:36.25,"handshake with Ruth, so it's okay for us to back out."""
560,00:34:38.79,00:34:38.79,"But we had an understanding to go to the final five, and to"
561,00:34:42.50,00:34:42.50,change horses midstream is a big mistake.
562,00:34:45.46,00:34:45.46,It's crazy. Be aware.
563,00:34:48.92,00:34:48.92,"If we take out Ruth tonight, we're down to four anyway,"
564,00:34:51.04,00:34:51.04,'cause Sally is going to jump ship.
565,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,I don't care what she says. She'll say anything right now.
566,00:34:55.96,00:34:55.96,">> Dude, I know she'll stay with us."
567,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,"She wants to be in this alliance so bad, she..."
568,00:35:00.08,00:35:00.08,">> Well, that's my thing. She wants to be in it so bad..."
569,00:35:02.29,00:35:02.29,>> I... >> ...she'll do whatever.
570,00:35:04.25,00:35:04.25,Whereas Ruth would die on her sword before she would give up
571,00:35:07.17,00:35:07.17,"her word. I think Sally would say, ""It's"
572,00:35:09.54,00:35:09.54,a game. I'm playing the game.
573,00:35:12.00,00:35:12.00,"I'm switching around."" >> There's a lot of strategy"
574,00:35:15.46,00:35:15.46,discussion amongst the tribe right now.
575,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,"Terry-- he tried to get real technical about it, said it was"
576,00:35:19.83,00:35:19.83,"really just Dan's promise to Ruth Marie, and it's kind of"
577,00:35:22.71,00:35:22.71,"like an easy, hollow rationalization."
578,00:35:26.17,00:35:26.17,I feel bad the way it's turned. Ruth Marie is part of the five
579,00:35:29.92,00:35:29.92,"of us, so I just... I don't want to go back on that."
580,00:35:33.04,00:35:33.04,">> Oh, look, they're all in here."
581,00:35:35.04,00:35:35.04,Look. >> Yeah.
582,00:35:37.00,00:35:37.00,>> It's a shame to pack up my stuff and leave here with so
583,00:35:39.62,00:35:39.62,much left to offer this tribe. It still could change.
584,00:35:42.71,00:35:42.71,I know there's some talking going on.
585,00:35:45.00,00:35:45.00,"It's like the almighty men are upstairs plotting, and us little"
586,00:35:48.08,00:35:48.08,"woman are just down here going, ""I wonder what they're going to"
587,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,"do."" >> Tell you what."
588,00:35:52.21,00:35:52.21,We're going to eat every stinking one of them.
589,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,">> I'm never going to be confident in Tribal Council, but"
590,00:35:57.25,00:35:57.25,I'm not walking around paranoid. I don't think it's me tonight.
591,00:36:02.08,00:36:02.08,"So Sally will be going home, unless something turns that I"
592,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,don't know about. >> This is going to be a Tribal
593,00:36:10.96,00:36:10.96,Council for the books right here.
594,00:36:13.33,00:36:13.33,Dan is campaigning hard for Ruth Marie.
595,00:36:16.17,00:36:16.17,I'm pulling for Sally. So tonight's vote is completely
596,00:36:18.12,00:36:18.12,still up in the air. We don't know what's going to
597,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,happen. (insects chirring)
598,00:36:38.92,00:36:38.92,>> PROBST: Welcome back to Tribal Council.
599,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,">> Thanks. >> PROBST: Terry, tell me about"
600,00:36:44.04,00:36:44.04,Exile Island. Describe it to somebody who has
601,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,"never been there. >> Uh, basically, you're there"
602,00:36:50.04,00:36:50.04,"with a barrel of untreated water, a flint and a machete."
603,00:36:55.08,00:36:55.08,No sleeping quarters. You've got to try to go gather
604,00:36:57.33,00:36:57.33,"your own food, and that's it. It's a unique experience, but I"
605,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,don't necessarily want to go back there.
606,00:37:03.79,00:37:03.79,">> PROBST: Sally, did anybody question him about the immunity"
607,00:37:05.96,00:37:05.96,idol? >> We talked about it a little
608,00:37:08.08,00:37:08.08,"bit. You know, he kind of said, ""I"
609,00:37:09.50,00:37:09.50,"spent a couple of hours looking for it."""
610,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,"He didn't give anything away, but he didn't give any"
611,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,"indication to let us know that he found it, either."
612,00:37:15.96,00:37:15.96,">> PROBST: Austin, what did you miss about Terry when he was"
613,00:37:18.58,00:37:18.58,gone? >> The best thing about having
614,00:37:20.75,00:37:20.75,Terry around is he's a natural leader.
615,00:37:22.79,00:37:22.79,"When he was gone, the rest of us were kind of floundering."
616,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,"It's not like we're all inept people, but it's nice to have"
617,00:37:27.62,00:37:27.62,"somebody kind of take charge and say, ""Hey, you guys be doing"
618,00:37:30.21,00:37:30.21,"this,"" type of thing. So, it's nice to have him back."
619,00:37:32.67,00:37:32.67,>> PROBST: Let's talk about individual performance today in
620,00:37:34.79,00:37:34.79,"the challenge. Sally, you dominated."
621,00:37:38.67,00:37:38.67,">> No matter what the challenge is, whether it's immunity or"
622,00:37:40.79,00:37:40.79,"whatever, I'm going to give it everything I have."
623,00:37:43.21,00:37:43.21,My best days out here are the days where we compete.
624,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,"And there was no way I was falling off that thing, and I"
625,00:37:47.38,00:37:47.38,"went as fast as I could, so... >> PROBST: Austin, what mistake"
626,00:37:51.25,00:37:51.25,have you made in the 11 days? >> Just in the challenge today.
627,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,"The bottom line was, both tribes had ample water to finish it"
628,00:37:57.83,00:37:57.83,off. Had I known that that was the
629,00:38:00.50,00:38:00.50,"amount that was going to put us over the edge, I wouldn't have"
630,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,been pouring like my grandmother.
631,00:38:04.29,00:38:04.29,"You know, I was over there just taking my sweet, precious time"
632,00:38:06.54,00:38:06.54,"with it. Meanwhile, they polish it off,"
633,00:38:08.46,00:38:08.46,"and they win the thing. So, you know, I'll take the"
634,00:38:10.58,00:38:10.58,"blame for that. >> PROBST: Ruth Marie, what's"
635,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,"holding you back in this tribe? >> Um, I think I'm small in"
636,00:38:16.96,00:38:16.96,"stature, and I'm twice as old as the other women."
637,00:38:21.50,00:38:21.50,>> PROBST: But you've been out here 11 days.
638,00:38:23.33,00:38:23.33,Do you feel like you've proven yourself?
639,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,>> I do. >> PROBST: Let's go back to the
640,00:38:27.71,00:38:27.71,"last Tribal Council. Sally, you're one big happy"
641,00:38:30.00,00:38:30.00,"tribe, and then Misty goes. Never saw it coming."
642,00:38:33.12,00:38:33.12,"Surprised? >> Oh, yeah, I was very"
643,00:38:35.04,00:38:35.04,surprised. I was the only one who voted
644,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"with Misty. I mean, I was the only one who"
645,00:38:38.75,00:38:38.75,"didn't know what was going on, so clearly, I was surprised."
646,00:38:41.25,00:38:41.25,>> PROBST: Do you think you know what's going on tonight?
647,00:38:43.25,00:38:43.25,">> You know, it's hard to say. I think everybody here is great,"
648,00:38:46.25,00:38:46.25,"and I want to be here tomorrow, and I want to wake up tomorrow"
649,00:38:48.50,00:38:48.50,"in that bamboo bed, but so does everybody else, so..."
650,00:38:52.12,00:38:52.12,">> PROBST: Ruth Marie, if it's you, what will this tribe miss"
651,00:38:54.96,00:38:54.96,tomorrow? >> I don't know that they will
652,00:38:57.46,00:38:57.46,"miss it tomorrow, but I am just steady, steady, steady, and get"
653,00:39:02.58,00:39:02.58,better as the game goes on. And I am an extremely loyal
654,00:39:06.21,00:39:06.21,person. And that may show up down the
655,00:39:09.38,00:39:09.38,"road. >> PROBST: Okay, before we get"
656,00:39:12.62,00:39:12.62,"to the vote, Terry, you're the only person who has been to"
657,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,Exile Island. You may or may not have found
658,00:39:17.71,00:39:17.71,"the idol. If you need to, you'll let me"
659,00:39:19.75,00:39:19.75,know after the vote. It is time to vote.
660,00:39:22.08,00:39:22.08,"Austin, you're up. >> It's probably going to be you"
661,00:39:37.79,00:39:37.79,"or me tonight, girl, so I'll miss you."
662,00:39:50.00,00:39:50.00,">> Sally, I adore you, but I'm voting my alliance."
663,00:40:00.67,00:40:00.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
664,00:40:12.25,00:40:12.25,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
665,00:40:14.62,00:40:14.62,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
666,00:40:16.46,00:40:16.46,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
667,00:40:20.62,00:40:20.62,"First vote, Ruthie. Sally."
668,00:40:30.46,00:40:30.46,"Ruth. Two votes Ruth, one vote Sally."
669,00:40:36.58,00:40:36.58,"Sally. We're tied-- two votes Sally,"
670,00:40:39.04,00:40:39.04,two votes Ruth. That's three votes Ruthie.
671,00:40:45.04,00:40:45.04,Two votes Sally. One vote left.
672,00:40:50.96,00:40:50.96,Fourth person voted out of the Survivor: Exile Island-- Ruth
673,00:40:53.08,00:40:53.08,Marie. You need to bring me your torch.
674,00:41:03.25,00:41:03.25,"Ruth Marie, the tribe has spoken."
675,00:41:08.21,00:41:08.21,"It's time for you to go. Well, in spite of the fact that"
676,00:41:20.04,00:41:20.04,"you've lost two tribe members in a row, you still seem positive,"
677,00:41:25.08,00:41:25.08,and that more than anything can help you to turn this game
678,00:41:27.71,00:41:27.71,around. Grab your torches.
679,00:41:29.46,00:41:29.46,Back to camp. Good night.

692,00:42:19.38,00:42:19.38,decision. It's a game.
693,00:42:20.83,00:42:20.83,It's fun. There are lots of twists and
694,00:42:22.54,00:42:22.54,"turns, but when you go through an experience like this, it"
695,00:42:24.67,00:42:24.67,"humbles you a little bit. So, Sally, Dan, Terry, Austin,"
696,00:42:29.42,00:42:29.42,"and Nick, I just wish them good luck."
