214,00:10:01.93,00:10:01.93,AND IT BROKE MY HEART.
215,00:10:04.10,00:10:04.10,AND HE MIGHT HAVE JUST LOST MY TRUST.
216,00:10:14.47,00:10:14.47,>> I'M SO UPSET.
217,00:10:15.77,00:10:15.77,I SPENT $100 TO GET MYSELF OUT OF THE FOOD AUCTION AND I WAS

340,00:16:23.77,00:16:23.77,MIKE TOOK A REALLY NICE MOMENT AND RUINED IT.
341,00:16:26.83,00:16:26.83,THAT HURT ME.
342,00:16:28.33,00:16:28.33,BECAUSE MIKE IS MY FRIEND.
343,00:16:29.73,00:16:29.73,"BUT HE IS CONVINCED THAT RODNEY HAS FLIPPED, WHICH NOW PUTS"
344,00:16:35.83,00:16:35.83,"MIKE, MYSELF AND SIERRA ON THE BOTTOM END OF THE FOOD CHAIN."

637,00:30:41.17,00:30:41.17,WE COULD BLINDSIDE MAMA C.
