2,00:00:03.07,00:00:03.07,Two tribes were abandoned in the middle of the Australian
3,00:00:04.83,00:00:04.83,outback... >> AMBER: Ogakor.
4,00:00:06.10,00:00:06.10,>> MARALYN: Ogakor. >> MICHAEL: Kucha.
5,00:00:07.47,00:00:07.47,>> DEBB: We're Kucha? >> JEFF: ...and had to make a
6,00:00:09.60,00:00:09.60,treacherous hike to find their camps.
7,00:00:11.13,00:00:11.13,>> AMBER: I'm a little tired. This rice is very heavy.
8,00:00:14.30,00:00:14.30,>> JEFF: But not everybody could stomach the trek.
9,00:00:16.50,00:00:16.50,">> JEFF V.: All of a sudden I just got sort of nauseous, and I"
10,00:00:19.40,00:00:19.40,"kept thinking to myself, ""I'm not going to get sick."""
11,00:00:21.47,00:00:21.47,"( retching ) >> JEFF: At Ogakor, tensions"
12,00:00:24.50,00:00:24.50,simmered between Keith and Jerri.
13,00:00:26.03,00:00:26.03,>> JERRI: I don't even really want to attempt to start a fire
14,00:00:28.13,00:00:28.13,until we get it where we want to keep it.
15,00:00:29.80,00:00:29.80,>> KEITH: I think we start the fire-- we take it where we want
16,00:00:31.47,00:00:31.47,to. >> JERRI: He might very well not
17,00:00:33.43,00:00:33.43,even be aware of some of the condescending remarks he made to
18,00:00:36.03,00:00:36.03,"me, but I'm not the kind of person to just let it slide off"
19,00:00:38.30,00:00:38.30,"my back. >> JEFF: At Kucha, there wasn't"
20,00:00:41.40,00:00:41.40,enough food to put in their mouths...
21,00:00:43.20,00:00:43.20,>> JEFF V.: I'm looking at bugs. >> JEFF: ...but there was plenty
22,00:00:46.23,00:00:46.23,"of Kimmi's mouth to go around. >> KIMMI: We was back-to-back,"
23,00:00:49.03,00:00:49.03,he farted in my... it rebounded...
24,00:00:50.97,00:00:50.97,>> JEFF V.: Kimmi will not shut up.
25,00:00:53.00,00:00:53.00,I just want to grab her by the neck and shake the ... out of
26,00:00:55.23,00:00:55.23,her. >> JEFF: Ogakor won the immunity
27,00:00:57.73,00:00:57.73,challenge... The immunity idol.
28,00:00:59.90,00:00:59.90,...so Kucha had to make the long hike to Tribal Council.
29,00:01:03.40,00:01:03.40,Debb was the first person voted out.
30,00:01:05.70,00:01:05.70,The tribe has spoken. 15 People left.
31,00:01:08.43,00:01:08.43,Who will be voted out tonight? >> JEFF V.: I saw Mike getting
32,00:02:34.47,00:02:34.47,up really early. The sun was just coming up.
33,00:02:37.77,00:02:37.77,"Everybody was asleep, and I woke up, and I saw Mike messing"
34,00:02:40.53,00:02:40.53,"around the fire and putting stuff on the pot, and I couldn't"
35,00:02:43.53,00:02:43.53,"understand what he was doing. And so as we were waking up, we"
36,00:02:48.27,00:02:48.27,"realized he put rice on, and nobody said anything about"
37,00:02:53.90,00:02:53.90,eating rice. Nobody said they were hungry.
38,00:02:56.80,00:02:56.80,"And he left. He just put the rice on, and he"
39,00:02:59.30,00:02:59.30,left. >> ALICIA: Are you making rice?
40,00:03:01.40,00:03:01.40,>> JEFF V.: Mike is. >> ALICIA: Mike's making rice
41,00:03:04.00,00:03:04.00,already? >> JEFF V.: I hope everybody's
42,00:03:05.97,00:03:05.97,hungry. I'm not hungry at all.
43,00:03:10.40,00:03:10.40,"That was totally not cool. >> ALICIA: No, I don't think"
44,00:03:12.13,00:03:12.13,"that was good. When it comes to food, it has to"
45,00:03:14.00,00:03:14.00,"be a group decision, since we don't have much."
46,00:03:17.03,00:03:17.03,Mike was hungry. That's why he did that.
47,00:03:19.43,00:03:19.43,"And that is another indication of Mike being Mike, about"
48,00:03:22.27,00:03:22.27,himself. >> MICHAEL: Everyday we've been
49,00:03:25.67,00:03:25.67,"having breakfast first thing in the morning, and I got up, and I"
50,00:03:28.50,00:03:28.50,"thought I was being really helpful, and I cleaned the pot,"
51,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,"and I boiled the water, and I made the rice, and I was going"
52,00:03:33.77,00:03:33.77,to have a warm meal for everybody when they woke up.
53,00:03:36.60,00:03:36.60,"Dig in, let's go. >> ALICIA: It's like rice"
54,00:03:41.60,00:03:41.60,"porridge. >> JEFF V.: It cooked too long,"
55,00:03:44.27,00:03:44.27,and it was mashy and just nasty. >> KIMMI: You know what?
56,00:03:47.17,00:03:47.17,We could use this as the wallpaper glue to hold
57,00:03:49.47,00:03:49.47,everything together. >> MICHAEL: It was odd that in
58,00:03:52.43,00:03:52.43,"fact it not only wasn't appreciated, they didn't like"
59,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,"it. >> KIMMI: Mike, baby, we love"
60,00:03:56.90,00:03:56.90,"you, but you're not qualified. >> MICHAEL: I think people are"
61,00:04:01.93,00:04:01.93,"starting to get a little bit edgy without food, and they"
62,00:04:04.33,00:04:04.33,don't realize how bad it's going to get.
63,00:04:07.40,00:04:07.40,"I'm a student of nutrition, and I know what this is doing to my"
64,00:04:10.23,00:04:10.23,body. But these other people have no
65,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,"idea. If they did, they would be out"
66,00:04:15.67,00:04:15.67,fishing and hunting for food. But they don't.
67,00:04:18.57,00:04:18.57,I guess maybe the way that I can convince them of the importance
68,00:04:22.93,00:04:22.93,of the food is by catching a lot of it and then feeling full one
69,00:04:27.33,00:04:27.33,time and seeing what happens to their body and how much energy
70,00:04:31.30,00:04:31.30,they have. Maybe that's how I can convince
71,00:04:33.30,00:04:33.30,"them. >> KEL: Maralyn, I'm going to go"
72,00:04:48.07,00:04:48.07,out and check the trap. >> MARALYN: Okay.
73,00:04:49.80,00:04:49.80,>> MITCHELL: Kel is like the fisherman of the group.
74,00:04:52.27,00:04:52.27,"He's very persistent in that area, and part of me thinks it's"
75,00:04:55.20,00:04:55.20,"because he feels if he does catch a fish, that might, um,"
76,00:04:58.40,00:04:58.40,keep him here longer. >> MARALYN: Good luck.
77,00:05:04.47,00:05:04.47,>> KEL: Thank you. Thank you.
78,00:05:08.33,00:05:08.33,">> MARALYN: There's a time to be energized, and there's a time to"
79,00:05:12.13,00:05:12.13,just chill out. So we're going to the family
80,00:05:15.57,00:05:15.57,whirlpool. ( laughter )
81,00:05:24.40,00:05:24.40,>> MARALYN: This will feel so good.
82,00:05:26.80,00:05:26.80,You'll be in ecstasy. ( indistinct chatter )
83,00:05:35.07,00:05:35.07,">> JERRI: Look at us, just hanging out like we're on"
84,00:05:37.07,00:05:37.07,vacation. This is great.
85,00:05:44.97,00:05:44.97,>> KEL: Our food strategy right now is rice.
86,00:05:47.27,00:05:47.27,"I mean, rice is our staple. I don't see that rice lasting us"
87,00:05:50.40,00:05:50.40,more than ten days. We do need to get some fish out
88,00:05:53.03,00:05:53.03,of this river. >> KEITH: Our plan for getting
89,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,"food is, uh... We don't really have a good"
90,00:05:58.83,00:05:58.83,"plan, actually. No fish."
91,00:06:02.87,00:06:02.87,Are we worried if there's no fish in the water?
92,00:06:04.43,00:06:04.43,>> COLBY: I'm not worried. >> MITCHELL: There ain't no fish
93,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,"in this water, I'll tell you that."
94,00:06:09.70,00:06:09.70,I say stop wasting the energy on fishing.
95,00:06:11.53,00:06:11.53,And I don't think there's any fish out there.
96,00:06:13.27,00:06:13.27,( laughs ) >> KEL: We've got some great
97,00:06:20.40,00:06:20.40,hooks that were in the crate. but I don't have any fishing
98,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17,line. And so what I've had to use is
99,00:06:24.27,00:06:24.27,"twine, and twine, um, is not as great as fishing line-- it"
100,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00,"breaks, you have to weave it together to get through the"
101,00:06:30.17,00:06:30.17,"hole. The fish can see it, obviously,"
102,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,"and plus the twine floats, so I have to tie a rock to the twine"
103,00:06:35.67,00:06:35.67,to make the twine sink which makes it even more noticeable to
104,00:06:38.50,00:06:38.50,the fish. >> COLBY: Kel's done a little
105,00:06:42.07,00:06:42.07,"bit of fishing which just, I mean, come on, the guy couldn't"
106,00:06:44.60,00:06:44.60,fish a rubber ducky out of the bathtub.
107,00:06:46.23,00:06:46.23,"The bait choices, the-the lines..."
108,00:06:48.30,00:06:48.30,He's just going about it the wrong way.
109,00:06:53.83,00:06:53.83,">> KEL: So I've been trying to fish every day, and I've been"
110,00:06:56.53,00:06:56.53,"unsuccessful, but I'm not going to quit."
111,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,I'm going to keep on doing it and doing it and doing it until
112,00:07:01.53,00:07:01.53,I can find a great fishing spot or a technique that works.
113,00:07:07.23,00:07:07.23,">> JERRI: Believe me, when he goes out, I'm hoping more than"
114,00:07:09.63,00:07:09.63,anybody that he's going to come back with some fish and some
115,00:07:11.97,00:07:11.97,"shrimp, and he'll have a big seafood buffet."
116,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77,"Any luck out there? >> KEL: No, but there are fish"
117,00:07:17.00,00:07:17.00,out there. I saw quite a few.
118,00:07:18.77,00:07:18.77,>> JERRI But it's not happening. And it's... ( laughs )
119,00:07:22.10,00:07:22.10,"He's just, he's not a fisherman, obviously."
120,00:07:25.23,00:07:25.23,He should keep his day job. ( laughing )
121,00:07:36.27,00:07:36.27,">> JEFF V.: Oh, wow. >> ALICIA: Whoa."
122,00:07:39.37,00:07:39.37,This is big time. >> JEFF V.: It's a reward.
123,00:07:43.27,00:07:43.27,">> ALICIA: There we go. >> JEFF V.: ""A leap of faith is"
124,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67,"not for the skilled. Just step off the edge, try not"
125,00:07:47.73,00:07:47.73,"to get killed. Like Sundance and Butch..."""
126,00:07:49.73,00:07:49.73,>> ALICIA ( gasps ): We're jumping off a cliff.

128,00:07:53.47,00:07:53.47,"Count on your friends while you're set adrift."""
129,00:07:55.23,00:07:55.23,>> ALICIA: You guys? >> JEFF V.: We've got a big one.
130,00:07:57.67,00:07:57.67,>> ALICIA: Did anybody see Sundance?
131,00:07:59.33,00:07:59.33,We get two blankets if we win.
132,00:08:00.97,00:08:00.97,">> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh. >> ALICIA: Feel it."
133,00:08:02.80,00:08:02.80,Two full-size blankets. >> NICK: How nice it'll be
134,00:08:04.87,00:08:04.87,"with blankets, man. >> ALICIA: Oh, my God."
135,00:08:07.63,00:08:07.63,We'll definitely sleep through the night if we have blankets.
136,00:08:10.60,00:08:10.60,>> KIMMI: Everybody has to jump? >> NICK: You're jumping off a
137,00:08:12.53,00:08:12.53,"cliff, bad boy. >> JEFF V.: Can you jump off a"

139,00:08:15.57,00:08:15.57,">> JEFF V.: Into water. >> RODGER: ""Step off the edge""?"
140,00:08:17.93,00:08:17.93,That's-that's... that's going over something.
141,00:08:19.87,00:08:19.87,"And we're off the edge. >> NICK: Yeah, I'm psyched."

144,00:08:27.63,00:08:27.63,jumping off a cliff into some water.
145,00:08:29.63,00:08:29.63,"Water is not mine finest... my uh, finest point, so, uh, I'm a"

154,00:08:53.10,00:08:53.10,"little fear of heights, too. I mean, you're talking to a guy"
155,00:08:56.07,00:08:56.07,"that wouldn't even ride the Ferris wheel at the fairs,"
156,00:08:58.63,00:08:58.63,'cause I just-just never did like heights.

223,00:14:31.80,00:14:31.80,"getting eight hours' sleep. We're not getting, you know, but"
224,00:14:34.37,00:14:34.37,"a handful of food a day. But, you know, this is the game"
225,00:14:37.53,00:14:37.53,we signed up to play. >> KEITH: You guys hungry?
226,00:14:40.43,00:14:40.43,>> MARALYN: Yes. >> JERRI: Are you cooking?
227,00:14:42.63,00:14:42.63,">> AMBER: Keith said he's a chef, but, and it's not that I"
228,00:14:45.57,00:14:45.57,"don't believe it-- he can't cook very well, you know?"
229,00:14:48.33,00:14:48.33,And I'm not doubting his talent. But I think it might be that
230,00:14:51.37,00:14:51.37,"he's adding, maybe, too much water to the rice."
231,00:14:53.63,00:14:53.63,>> TINA: It's pasty. It tastes like glue.
232,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07,It just... in your mouth it goes ( smacking )
233,00:14:59.80,00:14:59.80,"It's just horrible, and I can't eat it."
234,00:15:01.50,00:15:01.50,>> It just... it didn't make sense.
235,00:15:03.27,00:15:03.27,"It didn't make sense. Like, how could a gourmet chef"
236,00:15:05.73,00:15:05.73,not know how to make rice? There's a bunch more things we
237,00:15:10.07,00:15:10.07,"can have than rice, and I'm ready to start making some of"
238,00:15:12.13,00:15:12.13,them. I remembered that with flour and
239,00:15:15.53,00:15:15.53,water you can create some sort of dough.
240,00:15:18.63,00:15:18.63,">> KEITH: You know what we can do, while you're doing that?"
241,00:15:20.87,00:15:20.87,We're going to go get some more wood.
242,00:15:22.40,00:15:22.40,>> JERRI: All right. >> KEITH: So we'll be back in a
243,00:15:24.00,00:15:24.00,little while. >> JERRI: Keith is very
244,00:15:34.13,00:15:34.13,threatened by the fact that I made this tortilla this morning.
245,00:15:36.67,00:15:36.67,"That's why... I heard them when they went up on the hill, and"
246,00:15:39.13,00:15:39.13,"they were gathering wood, he was talking, again, about what he's"
247,00:15:41.67,00:15:41.67,going to do with the rice and the vegetables and this...
248,00:15:45.07,00:15:45.07,"You know, you just have to laugh."
249,00:15:46.43,00:15:46.43,You just have to laugh. ( giggling )
250,00:15:49.37,00:15:49.37,">> KEITH: So there's so much work to do as a team that, uh,"
251,00:15:53.07,00:15:53.07,"and it's hard, physical labor to come up here and grab all these"
252,00:15:55.33,00:15:55.33,big logs and stuff and throw them down.
253,00:15:56.90,00:15:56.90,"So, if she wants to cook some tortillas for breakfast, I think"
254,00:15:59.50,00:15:59.50,"it's fantastic. Actually, it's a break for me,"
255,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,"you know? No... ( chuckles ) no worries,"
256,00:16:03.37,00:16:03.37,mate. >> JERRI: I felt a little bit
257,00:16:06.90,00:16:06.90,"bad about it, but at the same time, you know, I felt like it"
258,00:16:09.73,00:16:09.73,was time for somebody to come in and take charge and change the
259,00:16:12.37,00:16:12.37,food situation. Go ahead.
260,00:16:16.00,00:16:16.00,"Go ahead. >> AMBER: Oh, my God."
261,00:16:21.97,00:16:21.97,It is so good. >> TINA: Thank you.
262,00:16:24.47,00:16:24.47,">> JERRI: Ah, you're welcome. >> AMBER: I love it!"
263,00:16:26.80,00:16:26.80,I love it. >> JERRI: We will eat today.
264,00:16:29.07,00:16:29.07,>> AMBER: Slap me five. >> TINA: Jerri's going to take
265,00:16:31.87,00:16:31.87,"that job over, which I hope doesn't hurt Keith's feelings."
266,00:16:34.73,00:16:34.73,"You know, I mean, that's his area, and it's kind of a slap in"
267,00:16:36.90,00:16:36.90,"the face. >> KEL: Thanks, Jerri."
268,00:16:39.80,00:16:39.80,>> JERRI: Today's communion. >> MITCHELL: Wow.
269,00:16:41.57,00:16:41.57,>> KEITH: Finest the restaurant in the world couldn't have made
270,00:16:43.70,00:16:43.70,those that nice. >> JERRI: Keith has gone out of
271,00:16:46.10,00:16:46.10,"his way to compliment me a lot now, to, like, try and smooth"
272,00:16:48.70,00:16:48.70,"the edges. And I see... I mean, I see right"
273,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33,through it. I don't-I don't think his
274,00:16:54.60,00:16:54.60,compliments are necessarily very genuine.
275,00:16:56.67,00:16:56.67,>> KEITH: That is good. I'm so glad they put wheat in
276,00:16:58.63,00:16:58.63,"there. >> COLBY: Thanks, Jerri."
277,00:17:00.47,00:17:00.47,">> JERRI: You know, the morale right now is kind of low, but I"
278,00:17:03.53,00:17:03.53,"think the tortilla made everybody spark up, so I'm"
279,00:17:06.13,00:17:06.13,really stoked about that. And I got a few other tricks to
280,00:17:09.83,00:17:09.83,pull out of my sleeve. >> MICHAEL: I want to bring food
281,00:17:19.67,00:17:19.67,"today. If I can keep providing food, I"
282,00:17:22.23,00:17:22.23,absolutely am sure I will make the merger.
283,00:17:25.27,00:17:25.27,"If I can't, I become vulnerable. I've been thinking a lot about"
284,00:17:30.03,00:17:30.03,the fact that at Tribal Council it came out that I was the
285,00:17:34.00,00:17:34.00,"leader, and I don't really want to be seen as the leader."
286,00:17:38.07,00:17:38.07,"So if I can get something, I'll lay real low on the other"
287,00:17:41.30,00:17:41.30,leadership areas and just be the food guy.
288,00:17:44.20,00:17:44.20,>> KIMMI: We got fish! It looks like you just went to
289,00:17:51.30,00:17:51.30,the fish market with all that fish.
290,00:17:53.03,00:17:53.03,>> ALICIA: Look at that. Who's better than you right
291,00:17:55.27,00:17:55.27,now? There's nobody I can think of.
292,00:17:57.33,00:17:57.33,">> JEFF V.: When other people catch a fish, they just catch a"
293,00:17:59.70,00:17:59.70,"fish. But when Mike catches it, there"
294,00:18:01.80,00:18:01.80,are trumpets that blare and angels that sing.
295,00:18:03.93,00:18:03.93,"And, you know, everybody's got to sit down and gather round him"
296,00:18:06.40,00:18:06.40,and hold his hands and watch him carve it out.
297,00:18:09.27,00:18:09.27,>> MICHAEL: Ow. Here you go.
298,00:18:12.07,00:18:12.07,">> ALICIA: Wow! >> MICHAEL: Dear God, you know I"
299,00:18:14.90,00:18:14.90,"said a lot of prayers today, and You answered them with fish for"
300,00:18:17.53,00:18:17.53,us. And I am so happy to be able to
301,00:18:20.07,00:18:20.07,provide fish for the troops. I know that this could easily
302,00:18:23.70,00:18:23.70,get turned around in some way to make me be the leader of the
303,00:18:27.43,00:18:27.43,"tribe, but this meal is, from the bottom of my heart, makes me"
304,00:18:31.30,00:18:31.30,so happy to be able to provide for everybody here.
305,00:18:34.27,00:18:34.27,So... thanks for that. >> NICK: Amen.
306,00:18:38.00,00:18:38.00,>> ALICIA: Amen. >> RODGER: Good job.
307,00:18:39.83,00:18:39.83,>> KIMMI: Mike thanked God for making him the leader of the
308,00:18:43.23,00:18:43.23,tribe. I don't know when he was
309,00:18:45.27,00:18:45.27,"anointed, but apparently, my back was turned at that moment."
310,00:18:49.57,00:18:49.57,">> MICHAEL: Oh, my God. >> RODGER: Well, get you another"
311,00:18:51.27,00:18:51.27,"bite. >> MICHAEL: No, no, no."
312,00:18:52.80,00:18:52.80,Take one bite and just keep passing them...
313,00:18:54.33,00:18:54.33,>> RODGER: Michael does like to be in the limelight.
314,00:18:56.27,00:18:56.27,I don't think there's any doubt about that.
315,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,"But as long as Mike keeps delivering the food though,"
316,00:18:59.90,00:18:59.90,"that's going to be a hard one to knock off, you know."
317,00:19:02.40,00:19:02.40,>> ALICIA: He really thinks he is leader of this tribe.
318,00:19:05.27,00:19:05.27,I'm telling you now that there are people in this tribe that
319,00:19:08.57,00:19:08.57,want to vote him off already. >> MARALYN: I am very
320,00:19:22.10,00:19:22.10,disappointed at what happened five minutes ago.
321,00:19:25.63,00:19:25.63,Jerri reported to the rest of us that she had seen Kel chewing a
322,00:19:31.40,00:19:31.40,brown substance. What she thought was beef jerky.
323,00:19:36.70,00:19:36.70,>> JERRI: And I saw him put something in his mouth and it
324,00:19:40.13,00:19:40.13,"was like dark brown colored, shredded looking sort of thing."
325,00:19:43.73,00:19:43.73,>> MITCHELL: Jerri blatantly that said she saw something that
326,00:19:46.47,00:19:46.47,looked just like beef jerky go into his mouth.
327,00:19:48.37,00:19:48.37,"And I... I believe her, actually."
328,00:19:50.03,00:19:50.03,">> JERRI: I guarantee it was. >> AMBER: I saw him chewing, but"
329,00:19:52.53,00:19:52.53,"you saw... >> COLBY: I saw him chewing,"
330,00:19:54.23,00:19:54.23,too. >> JERRI: I mean to have your
331,00:19:56.30,00:19:56.30,own team member possibly be holding food behind you and
332,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,surviving on their own little private stash while the rest of
333,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,us are... starving basically is not a good way to start off on
334,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,the right foot with a bunch of strangers.
335,00:20:09.23,00:20:09.23,"Because to think that someone in our own tribe would be, you"
336,00:20:12.87,00:20:12.87,"know, sneaking in extra stuff, especially food."
337,00:20:16.63,00:20:16.63,">> MITCHELL: Well, if you're eating anything that we weren't"
338,00:20:19.13,00:20:19.13,"eating, then that's unfair to the rest of us."
339,00:20:21.17,00:20:21.17,">> TINA: If he had beef jerky, I'd kill him dead."
340,00:20:24.00,00:20:24.00,>> MARALYN: The pot starts to boil.
341,00:20:26.53,00:20:26.53,"While Kel was up on the hill, they rifled through his bag."
342,00:20:32.33,00:20:32.33,">> TINA: You know, it was like a big feeding frenzy."
343,00:20:34.43,00:20:34.43,"You know, ""Kel's got beef jerky."""
344,00:20:35.87,00:20:35.87,"And they said, ""Look in his backpack real quick."""
345,00:20:37.77,00:20:37.77,"And I was standing right there, and I did it."
346,00:20:39.90,00:20:39.90,And there wasn't anything in there at all.
347,00:20:42.67,00:20:42.67,"But still and yet, all I was thinking about, ""If I find beef"
348,00:20:45.80,00:20:45.80,"jerky in here, it's going to be ugly."""
349,00:20:47.83,00:20:47.83,">> COLBY: He's snacking up there, I know it."
350,00:20:50.53,00:20:50.53,( scattered chuckling ) >> MARALYN: Ouch.
351,00:20:54.33,00:20:54.33,"Within earshot of Kel, it was overheard, and Kel came back"
352,00:21:00.80,00:21:00.80,"down. >> KEITH: Hey, Kel."
353,00:21:03.17,00:21:03.17,>> KEL: How you doing? >> KEITH: Good. How are you?
354,00:21:05.03,00:21:05.03,>> KEL: Good. Hey.
355,00:21:05.97,00:21:05.97,"Hey, guys? >> MARALYN: Did you find"
356,00:21:07.90,00:21:07.90,anything? >> KEL: How are you guys doing?
357,00:21:09.97,00:21:09.97,>> MARALYN: Did you find anything?
358,00:21:11.50,00:21:11.50,">> KEL: Just a second, just a second."
359,00:21:13.73,00:21:13.73,"How are you guys doing? Look, while I was going up there"
360,00:21:16.77,00:21:16.77,"looking for bait for fishing, you guys were talking about that"
361,00:21:19.50,00:21:19.50,you thought I was eating beef jerky...
362,00:21:21.13,00:21:21.13,"That was a blade of grass, and I smooshed it up into my jaw, and"
363,00:21:24.40,00:21:24.40,I was chewing on that. I was just chewing grass.
364,00:21:27.97,00:21:27.97,">> JERRI: Well, in order to put grass in your mouth, you have to"
365,00:21:30.50,00:21:30.50,go get grass first. And I don't think you get grass
366,00:21:32.63,00:21:32.63,out of your pocket. >> KEL: Just chewing a piece...

611,00:35:53.57,00:35:53.57,to vote for Jerri. And the reason why I'm going to
612,00:35:56.03,00:35:56.03,vote for Jerri is because I've already told Maralyn that I was
613,00:35:58.87,00:35:58.87,"going to do that, and I'm not going to break my word."
614,00:36:01.93,00:36:01.93,"And Maralyn told me she was going to vote for Jerri, too."

621,00:36:31.03,00:36:31.03,"I mean, I think I would vote them right off just 'cause"
622,00:36:33.37,00:36:33.37,they've been married for 50 years.
623,00:36:34.93,00:36:34.93,That's a good alliance. >> KEITH: This game is all about

626,00:37:04.40,00:37:04.40,ritual. I would like you to go ahead and
627,00:37:06.30,00:37:06.30,grab a torch... and approach the flame.
628,00:37:11.60,00:37:11.60,"Dip your torches in, and once they're lit, you can put them"
629,00:37:14.13,00:37:14.13,back in their slot. We do this because fire does
630,00:37:22.10,00:37:22.10,represent life. These torches will now represent
631,00:37:25.13,00:37:25.13,"your life, your identity at Tribal Council."
632,00:37:29.20,00:37:29.20,I haven't had a chance to talk to you guys at Tribal Council

634,00:37:35.10,00:37:35.10,You have fire. You have a professional chef.
635,00:37:38.03,00:37:38.03,You guys should be eating very well.

638,00:37:45.83,00:37:45.83,and stuff. But we realized earlier we had
639,00:37:47.93,00:37:47.93,"flour, and Jerri is a phenomenal cook, so she steps in and she's"
640,00:37:50.40,00:37:50.40,made tortillas. We've had those for breakfast
641,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,"every morning. When we're done, we have Jerri's"
642,00:37:54.43,00:37:54.43,tortillas shop opening up. >> JEFF: Why are you cooking if
643,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73,he's the chef? ( Jerri sighs )
644,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,>> JERRI: I knew you were going to go there.
645,00:38:01.57,00:38:01.57,( laughs ) The rice was a little pasty the
646,00:38:04.07,00:38:04.07,"first couple of nights, and it got to the point where none of"
647,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,"us wanted to eat it, and that's when I felt I needed to step in"
648,00:38:11.30,00:38:11.30,because we were losing strength. Our morale was down.
649,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,"I mean, when you don't want to even eat, that's a really bad"
650,00:38:18.10,00:38:18.10,sign of bad things to come. So I just took it upon myself.

656,00:38:35.97,00:38:35.97,out yesterday. ( Amber and Jerri groaning )

658,00:38:41.27,00:38:41.27,>> TINA: Probably throwing up that intestines that I ate and
659,00:38:44.90,00:38:44.90,feeling like I let my team down. >> JEFF: So let me ask you the
660,00:38:48.30,00:38:48.30,question that is most on my mind: Do you feel like you need
661,00:38:50.90,00:38:50.90,"to say, ""I know I screwed up, but guys, here's why you should"
662,00:38:53.27,00:38:53.27,"keep me""? >> TINA: Absolutely not."
663,00:38:54.90,00:38:54.90,"I feel like I-I'm the one who screwed up, I should be the"
664,00:38:56.87,00:38:56.87,"one to go. >> JEFF: Having said that, it is"
665,00:39:00.27,00:39:00.27,"time to vote. Jerri, you're first."

668,00:39:30.07,00:39:30.07,"for you. I made this on day one, and I"
669,00:39:32.77,00:39:32.77,"don't break my promises. Sorry about that, Jerri."
670,00:39:46.67,00:39:46.67,>> MITCHELL: As much as we could use your strength in our
671,00:39:50.27,00:39:50.27,"challenges, we're a little sick and tired of some of your games."
672,00:39:53.23,00:39:53.23,The only comfort I have in voting this way is the fact that
673,00:39:56.07,00:39:56.07,you brought this on all by yourself.
674,00:39:57.53,00:39:57.53,I'm sorry. >> MARALYN: Kel.
675,00:40:21.63,00:40:21.63,"Kel, if you were lying in the Simpson Desert, dying of thirst,"
676,00:40:27.43,00:40:27.43,every single one of us would give you a drink of water.
677,00:40:32.07,00:40:32.07,Good luck to you. >> JEFF: Once the votes are
678,00:40:43.17,00:40:43.17,"tallied, the decision is final. The person will be asked to"
679,00:40:45.73,00:40:45.73,leave the Tribal Council area along this bridge.
680,00:40:49.30,00:40:49.30,The first vote... Kel.

688,00:42:03.43,00:42:03.43,You have a long walk home. Go ahead and grab your torches
689,00:42:06.17,00:42:06.17,and head back to camp. See you tomorrow.

702,00:43:07.73,00:43:07.73,people. It was going to be very hard for
703,00:43:10.33,00:43:10.33,"me to fit into that mixture. I tried, I really did."
704,00:43:13.57,00:43:13.57,But I don't think in a couple of days I could have overcome our
