35,00:02:48.27,00:02:48.27,"realized he put rice on, andnobody said anything about"
36,00:02:53.90,00:02:53.90,eating rice.Nobody said they were hungry.
37,00:02:56.80,00:02:56.80,"And he left.He just put the rice on, and he"
38,00:02:59.30,00:02:59.30,left.>> ALICIA: Are you making rice?

41,00:03:05.97,00:03:05.97,hungry.I'm not hungry at all.
42,00:03:10.40,00:03:10.40,"That was totally not cool.>> ALICIA: No, I don't think"
43,00:03:12.13,00:03:12.13,"that was good.When it comes to food, it has to"
44,00:03:14.00,00:03:14.00,"be a group decision, since wedon't have much."
45,00:03:17.03,00:03:17.03,Mike was hungry.That's why he did that.
46,00:03:19.43,00:03:19.43,"And that is another indicationof Mike being Mike, about"
47,00:03:22.27,00:03:22.27,himself.>> MICHAEL: Everyday we've been
48,00:03:25.67,00:03:25.67,"having breakfast first thing inthe morning, and I got up, and I"
49,00:03:28.50,00:03:28.50,"thought I was being reallyhelpful, and I cleaned the pot,"
50,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,"and I boiled the water, and Imade the rice, and I was going"
51,00:03:33.77,00:03:33.77,to have a warm meal foreverybody when they woke up.
52,00:03:36.60,00:03:36.60,"Dig in, let's go.>> ALICIA: It's like rice"
53,00:03:41.60,00:03:41.60,"porridge.>> JEFF V.: It cooked too long,"
54,00:03:44.27,00:03:44.27,and it was mashy and just nasty.>> KIMMI: You know what?
55,00:03:47.17,00:03:47.17,We could use this as thewallpaper glue to hold
56,00:03:49.47,00:03:49.47,everything together.>> MICHAEL: It was odd that in
57,00:03:52.43,00:03:52.43,"fact it not only wasn'tappreciated, they didn't like"
58,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,"it.>> KIMMI: Mike, baby, we love"
59,00:03:56.90,00:03:56.90,"you, but you're not qualified.>> MICHAEL: I think people are"
60,00:04:01.93,00:04:01.93,"starting to get a little bitedgy without food, and they"
61,00:04:04.33,00:04:04.33,don't realize how bad it's goingto get.
62,00:04:07.40,00:04:07.40,"I'm a student of nutrition, andI know what this is doing to my"
63,00:04:10.23,00:04:10.23,body.But these other people have no
64,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,"idea.If they did, they would be out"
65,00:04:15.67,00:04:15.67,fishing and hunting for food.But they don't.
66,00:04:18.57,00:04:18.57,I guess maybe the way that I canconvince them of the importance
67,00:04:22.93,00:04:22.93,of the food is by catching a lotof it and then feeling full one
68,00:04:27.33,00:04:27.33,time and seeing what happens totheir body and how much energy
69,00:04:31.30,00:04:31.30,they have.Maybe that's how I can convince

73,00:04:52.27,00:04:52.27,"He's very persistent in thatarea, and part of me thinks it's"
74,00:04:55.20,00:04:55.20,"because he feels if he doescatch a fish, that might, um,"
75,00:04:58.40,00:04:58.40,keep him here longer.>> MARALYN: Good luck.
76,00:05:04.47,00:05:04.47,>> KEL: Thank you.Thank you.
77,00:05:08.33,00:05:08.33,">> MARALYN: There's a time to beenergized, and there's a time to"

84,00:05:44.97,00:05:44.97,>> KEL: Our food strategy rightnow is rice.
85,00:05:47.27,00:05:47.27,"I mean, rice is our staple.I don't see that rice lasting us"
86,00:05:50.40,00:05:50.40,more than ten days.We do need to get some fish out
87,00:05:53.03,00:05:53.03,of this river.>> KEITH: Our plan for getting
88,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,"food is, uh...We don't really have a good"
89,00:05:58.83,00:05:58.83,"plan, actually.No fish."
90,00:06:02.87,00:06:02.87,Are we worried if there's nofish in the water?
91,00:06:04.43,00:06:04.43,>> COLBY: I'm not worried.>> MITCHELL: There ain't no fish
92,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,"in this water, I'll tell youthat."
93,00:06:09.70,00:06:09.70,I say stop wasting the energyon fishing.
94,00:06:11.53,00:06:11.53,And I don't think there's anyfish out there.

97,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17,line.And so what I've had to use is
98,00:06:24.27,00:06:24.27,"twine, and twine, um, is not asgreat as fishing line-- it"
99,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00,"breaks, you have to weave ittogether to get through the"
100,00:06:30.17,00:06:30.17,"hole.The fish can see it, obviously,"
101,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,"and plus the twine floats, so Ihave to tie a rock to the twine"
102,00:06:35.67,00:06:35.67,to make the twine sink whichmakes it even more noticeable to
103,00:06:38.50,00:06:38.50,the fish.>> COLBY: Kel's done a little
104,00:06:42.07,00:06:42.07,"bit of fishing which just, Imean, come on, the guy couldn't"
105,00:06:44.60,00:06:44.60,fish a rubber ducky out of thebathtub.
106,00:06:46.23,00:06:46.23,"The bait choices, the-thelines..."
107,00:06:48.30,00:06:48.30,He's just going about it thewrong way.

109,00:06:56.53,00:06:56.53,"unsuccessful, but I'm not goingto quit."
110,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,I'm going to keep on doing itand doing it and doing it until
111,00:07:01.53,00:07:01.53,I can find a great fishing spotor a technique that works.
112,00:07:07.23,00:07:07.23,">> JERRI: Believe me, when hegoes out, I'm hoping more than"
113,00:07:09.63,00:07:09.63,anybody that he's going to comeback with some fish and some
114,00:07:11.97,00:07:11.97,"shrimp, and he'll have a bigseafood buffet."
115,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77,"Any luck out there?>> KEL: No, but there are fish"
