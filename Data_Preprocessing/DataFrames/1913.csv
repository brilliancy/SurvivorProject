2,00:00:03.17,00:00:03.17,Survivor... >> I'm in control of this game.
3,00:00:05.46,00:00:05.46,Everything has worked for me so far.
4,00:00:07.58,00:00:07.58,"I set up my alliance so strong. My people-- they come up to me,"
5,00:00:11.79,00:00:11.79,"they tell me everything. >> PROBST: By day 30, Russell"
6,00:00:14.04,00:00:14.04,"was driving on cruise control, mowing down anyone who got in"
7,00:00:17.00,00:00:17.00,his way. >> Now I can comfortably sit on
8,00:00:19.88,00:00:19.88,my throne and watch everybody bicker at each other.
9,00:00:22.96,00:00:22.96,>> PROBST: He felt so comfortable that he let his
10,00:00:25.17,00:00:25.17,guard down and revealed a secret.
11,00:00:30.79,00:00:30.79,"Meanwhile, Shambo had what she thought was a psychic vision."
12,00:00:36.04,00:00:36.04,>> I had a dream last night we voted Dave off.
13,00:00:38.33,00:00:38.33,>> PROBST: So she immediately decided that's what everyone had
14,00:00:40.50,00:00:40.50,to do. >> I am definitely in a position
15,00:00:44.04,00:00:44.04,of power. Dave is so gone.
16,00:00:47.25,00:00:47.25,>> PROBST: But Russell decided that John was the one who needed
17,00:00:50.38,00:00:50.38,"to go, so he told everyone but Shambo to switch their votes."
18,00:00:53.75,00:00:53.75,>> The best way to do this... >> Uh-huh.
19,00:00:56.04,00:00:56.04,>> ...is John. It will be you if it's not John.
20,00:00:59.08,00:00:59.08,>> PROBST: Jaison was worried about going against Shambo's
21,00:01:01.71,00:01:01.71,wishes because her vote is critical to keeping a majority.
22,00:01:05.17,00:01:05.17,>> You piss off Shambo and she's going to go to the other side.
23,00:01:08.88,00:01:08.88,">> PROBST: But at Tribal Council, Jaison and everyone but"
24,00:01:11.79,00:01:11.79,Shambo followed Russell's lead. Tenth person voted out and the
25,00:01:15.25,00:01:15.25,fourth member of our jury-- John.
26,00:01:19.46,00:01:19.46,Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
27,00:01:31.17,00:01:31.17,">> Wow. John was majorly blindsided, as"
28,00:01:34.50,00:01:34.50,was I. I had no idea they were voting
29,00:01:38.04,00:01:38.04,"John. The plan was to vote Dave, and I"
30,00:01:41.42,00:01:41.42,am positively stunned. Okay.
31,00:01:48.75,00:01:48.75,">> So he was trying to get rid of you, and I didn't want you"
32,00:01:51.58,00:01:51.58,"to, to, uh... >> Break my word."
33,00:01:53.25,00:01:53.25,>> Break your word to him. >> I couldn't have.
34,00:01:54.54,00:01:54.54,I would have written Dave down anyway.
35,00:01:56.46,00:01:56.46,>> So everything's still cool. I don't want you to worry.
36,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,Nothing's going crazy or nothing.
37,00:02:01.54,00:02:01.54,>> All right. >> My damage control with Shambo
38,00:02:05.04,00:02:05.04,"definitely worked. I just lied to her, which is"
39,00:02:08.00,00:02:08.00,exactly what I've been doing this whole time.
40,00:02:10.08,00:02:10.08,I've lied about almost every aspect of my life.
41,00:02:13.08,00:02:13.08,"I'm the richest man here, but I lied about what I do for a"
42,00:02:15.96,00:02:15.96,living because I'll do whatever it takes to win this game.
43,00:02:23.33,00:02:23.33,">> All right, good night. This is too easy."
44,00:02:30.75,00:02:30.75,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Oh, no."
45,00:02:48.92,00:02:48.92,"We're just kind of shooting the breeze, letting..."
46,00:02:53.29,00:02:53.29,">> Oh. The game's not over yet, you"
47,00:02:56.58,00:02:56.58,"know. >> Oh, no, no, not at all."
48,00:02:59.92,00:02:59.92,">> Of all the people still here, who would you guys vote for, I"
49,00:03:02.54,00:03:02.54,"mean, if you were on the jury? >> Russell and Mick could get a"
50,00:03:05.75,00:03:05.75,"lot of votes. >> Yeah, I think they could."
51,00:03:07.58,00:03:07.58,I think they will. >> I think Russell is the
52,00:03:09.58,00:03:09.58,biggest threat by far. >> Yeah.
53,00:03:11.29,00:03:11.29,">> 'Cause people are gonna be like, ""That guy played an insane"
54,00:03:13.17,00:03:13.17,"game."" >> Right."
55,00:03:15.17,00:03:15.17,">> It's always interesting to me because behind the scenes, it"
56,00:03:17.33,00:03:17.33,"really has been me and Russell making decisions, but..."
57,00:03:20.21,00:03:20.21,">> Right, right. >> I kind of left him out there"
58,00:03:21.96,00:03:21.96,to be the aggressive bulldog while I kind of stayed behind
59,00:03:25.08,00:03:25.08,"the scenes, trying to be nice. >> Oh, no, that could ruin you."
60,00:03:27.04,00:03:27.04,">> Apparently, that was a... No, honestly, and I'm beginning"
61,00:03:29.21,00:03:29.21,to think that was the wrong strategy.
62,00:03:32.12,00:03:32.12,This is an interesting phase in the game because you really have
63,00:03:35.12,00:03:35.12,"to start thinking about winning over the jury, and the way that"
64,00:03:38.08,00:03:38.08,I'm gonna try to play the jury is that the decisions that we
65,00:03:40.92,00:03:40.92,made were group decisions. I had a big part in those
66,00:03:42.75,00:03:42.75,decisions. It wasn't just Russell
67,00:03:44.67,00:03:44.67,"unilaterally doing this. Plus, you know, he was an"
68,00:03:47.42,00:03:47.42,"abrasive guy. I was the more calm, cool, bond-"
69,00:03:49.58,00:03:49.58,"with-you kind of guy, so I feel like I'm the guy that should get"
70,00:03:53.08,00:03:53.08,"that million dollars. >> I mean, if I was in your"
71,00:03:55.00,00:03:55.00,situation... >> The interesting thing about
72,00:04:01.46,00:04:01.46,"day 36 is that at that point, there's no hidden immunity idols"
73,00:04:05.04,00:04:05.04,"anymore. There's no nothing, so it's--"
74,00:04:07.75,00:04:07.75,"everyone gets an equal vote, and..."
75,00:04:11.96,00:04:11.96,>> Just make it to day 36. >> Yeah.
76,00:04:20.21,00:04:20.21,>> Today I found out that Russell already has a lot of
77,00:04:24.04,00:04:24.04,"money, and I'm starting to see some of the cracks in their"
78,00:04:27.79,00:04:27.79,"armor, and I think this will be the time that tests their"
79,00:04:32.12,00:04:32.12,"loyalty to each other, especially as they all have"
80,00:04:35.04,00:04:35.04,"different opinions of who they see in the final three, so it's"
81,00:04:38.92,00:04:38.92,just a matter of time before that bomb ticks and then blows
82,00:04:41.88,00:04:41.88,"up. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
83,00:04:53.12,00:04:53.12,">> Cool. >> PROBST: All right, today, no"
84,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,reward challenge. Today we're playing for
85,00:05:04.12,00:05:04.12,immunity. >> Everybody was expecting the
86,00:05:07.08,00:05:07.08,reward challenge. I'm happier than the reward
87,00:05:11.21,00:05:11.21,'cause I'm ready to start eliminating some people out
88,00:05:12.83,00:05:12.83,here. I want to go to Tribal time and
89,00:05:15.38,00:05:15.38,time again. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get
90,00:05:17.29,00:05:17.29,to it? >> Yes.
91,00:05:19.12,00:05:19.12,">> PROBST: First things first, Jaison, I will take back the"
92,00:05:21.21,00:05:21.21,"immunity necklace. Once again, immunity is back up"
93,00:05:30.42,00:05:30.42,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
94,00:05:33.08,00:05:33.08,take part in a Survivor bowling tournament.
95,00:05:36.04,00:05:36.04,Here's how it works-- you will be randomly matched up against
96,00:05:39.08,00:05:39.08,"another person. Your goal, very simple: roll the"
97,00:05:42.42,00:05:42.42,"ball down the lane, knock over as many pins as you can."
98,00:05:46.79,00:05:46.79,You get two shots. Winner moves on to the next
99,00:05:49.29,00:05:49.29,round. Loser is out.
100,00:05:51.71,00:05:51.71,"Last person left standing wins immunity, guaranteed a one in"
101,00:05:56.67,00:05:56.67,seven shot at a million bucks. Guys ready to get to it?
102,00:06:00.54,00:06:00.54,>> Yes. >> Make it happen.
103,00:06:02.21,00:06:02.21,>> PROBST: We'll draw for matchups and we'll get started.
104,00:06:09.21,00:06:09.21,"All right, Natalie and Shambo. First matchup."
105,00:06:13.12,00:06:13.12,Choose a ball and roll. Purple always goes first.
106,00:06:18.29,00:06:18.29,"That's you, Natalie. >> Oh, dear."
107,00:06:22.12,00:06:22.12,>> PROBST: Got to get the jitters out.
108,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,"Natalie throws a gutter ball on her first roll, opening the door"
109,00:06:28.38,00:06:28.38,for Shambo. >> This is for all my friends
110,00:06:30.29,00:06:30.29,that play in a bowling league. >> PROBST: Look at that.
111,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,">> Oh, Sham. >> PROBST: Wow."
112,00:06:37.04,00:06:37.04,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: Shambo with a nice
113,00:06:39.08,00:06:39.08,first ball of nine. >> That was good.
114,00:06:41.00,00:06:41.00,(Dave whistles) >> Wow.
115,00:06:42.58,00:06:42.58,">> PROBST: Natalie, you have to knock down at least nine pins or"
116,00:06:45.92,00:06:45.92,you're out of this tournament just like that.
117,00:06:50.38,00:06:50.38,">> Yeah, looks good. >> PROBST: That's a good roll."
118,00:06:52.08,00:06:52.08,">> Wow, oh, wow. >> PROBST: But not enough."
119,00:06:54.79,00:06:54.79,Natalie is out. Shambo moves on to the next
120,00:06:57.17,00:06:57.17,round. Next matchup-- Brett taking on
121,00:07:01.46,00:07:01.46,"Russell. Brett, gutter ball."
122,00:07:07.21,00:07:07.21,>> A little off. That's all right.
123,00:07:11.04,00:07:11.04,">> Nicely done, Russell. >> PROBST: Russell right down"
124,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,"the middle. >> Oh, good job, Russ."
125,00:07:14.92,00:07:14.92,>> PROBST: Russell knocked down four pins.
126,00:07:17.83,00:07:17.83,"Brett, got to knock down at least four or you are out."
127,00:07:24.50,00:07:24.50,That's not going to do it. Brett is out of this challenge.
128,00:07:27.08,00:07:27.08,"Russell moves on. >> Good job, Russ."
129,00:07:29.46,00:07:29.46,>> PROBST: Next round-- Jaison taking on Monica.

134,00:07:52.62,00:07:52.62,Monica. That's down the middle.
135,00:07:54.33,00:07:54.33,You need six or more to stay alive.
136,00:07:56.79,00:07:56.79,One won't do it. Monica is out.

192,00:11:28.38,00:11:28.38,Nice job. >> Thank you.
193,00:11:32.50,00:11:32.50,">> PROBST: Once again, Jaison is safe at tonight's Tribal"
194,00:11:35.50,00:11:35.50,"Council. After 31 days, one of you going"
195,00:11:38.21,00:11:38.21,home. Grab your stuff.
196,00:11:40.04,00:11:40.04,Head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal.
197,00:11:41.62,00:11:41.62,Congrats. >> Thanks.
198,00:11:43.58,00:11:43.58,">> When Dave did not win that challenge, I was, like..."
199,00:11:47.21,00:11:47.21,"(whispers): ""Buh-bye."" Dave's going home tonight."
200,00:11:56.21,00:11:56.21,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> I'm gonna walk down the
201,00:12:11.96,00:12:11.96,"beach, I think. For me, the tide has turned."
202,00:12:15.38,00:12:15.38,I am low man on the pole. All I know is somebody's going
203,00:12:19.04,00:12:19.04,"home, and it ain't gonna be Jaison."
204,00:12:37.21,00:12:37.21,>> Hey. >> Yeah.
205,00:12:47.21,00:12:47.21,>> All right. I think the case for getting
206,00:12:49.29,00:12:49.29,rid of Dave primarily is because that's who Shambo wants gone
207,00:12:52.83,00:12:52.83,right now. And let's just keep the waters
208,00:12:54.88,00:12:54.88,"calm, you know? We stirred up enough by getting"
209,00:12:57.00,00:12:57.00,"rid of John-- we don't want to... anger her, or get her"
210,00:13:00.38,00:13:00.38,"upset. >> Well, what names are in your"
211,00:13:15.50,00:13:15.50,"head right now? >> Right now, Dave's going home."
212,00:13:19.62,00:13:19.62,>> You think so? >> I know so.
213,00:13:22.21,00:13:22.21,>> And that's just decided? >> That's just it.
214,00:13:25.71,00:13:25.71,>> I just don't think that Dave is this big threat that people
215,00:13:28.58,00:13:28.58,"think he is, I really don't. Right now I'm trying to stay a"
216,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,little bit more passive and really get into people's heads.
217,00:13:35.42,00:13:35.42,Russell is no fool. He's not about to take someone
218,00:13:38.29,00:13:38.29,like Shambo that far who could potentially get a lot of jury
219,00:13:42.00,00:13:42.00,votes. I think we're underestimating
220,00:13:44.04,00:13:44.04,"Shambo, though. Shambo is a hard worker around"
221,00:13:46.25,00:13:46.25,camp. >> I know she is.
222,00:13:48.21,00:13:48.21,">> And let's face it, a majority of the jury is Galu."
223,00:13:52.08,00:13:52.08,They look at Shambo as a strong woman who really competed in
224,00:13:57.38,00:13:57.38,"challenges and kept things going around camp, who's"
225,00:14:00.25,00:14:00.25,always in the running for immunity.
226,00:14:02.38,00:14:02.38,">> Yeah, I see your point. >> I just started to plant the"
227,00:14:05.83,00:14:05.83,seed and make arguments that would make Russell sweat.
228,00:14:09.92,00:14:09.92,"I mean, with me on Dave's side and whispering Shambo's name in"
229,00:14:13.08,00:14:13.08,"Russell's ear, anything can happen."
230,00:14:15.54,00:14:15.54,I think you should still keep options open.
231,00:14:19.25,00:14:19.25,">> Yeah. I'm hearing you, that's for"
232,00:14:21.33,00:14:21.33,sure. I have a lot of options in the
233,00:14:24.08,00:14:24.08,game right now. I can play different ways and
234,00:14:26.71,00:14:26.71,still be okay. One option I have is keeping
235,00:14:30.75,00:14:30.75,"Dave, because I know I can beat Dave for the million dollars."
236,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,"Just think, me, Dave, for a million dollars?"
237,00:14:38.04,00:14:38.04,It's a no-brainer. I have to win.
238,00:14:41.50,00:14:41.50,So it's a good strategic move to keep Dave around.
239,00:14:46.83,00:14:46.83,"I'm gonna tell you, Dave. >> All right, what's up, buddy?"
240,00:14:49.25,00:14:49.25,>> Your best strategic move... >> Uh-huh.
241,00:14:51.88,00:14:51.88,>> ...would be talking to me. >> Mm.
242,00:14:54.21,00:14:54.21,>> I don't know why you ain't came to me yet.
243,00:14:56.67,00:14:56.67,">> All right, well, it sounds like you got some thoughts in"
244,00:14:58.75,00:14:58.75,"your mind. >> Yes, I do."
245,00:15:00.62,00:15:00.62,>> I'd be interested in hearing them.
246,00:15:02.29,00:15:02.29,">> Right now, everybody is debating you and Shambo."
247,00:15:04.58,00:15:04.58,">> Okay. >> So if I decide Shambo, I"
248,00:15:07.62,00:15:07.62,could get Natalie. >> I could get Brett and Monica
249,00:15:10.71,00:15:10.71,"on that, no problem. >> So that's five right there."
250,00:15:13.83,00:15:13.83,">> That's all we need. Russell comes to me and says,"
251,00:15:16.50,00:15:16.50,"""If you, Brett, and Monica vote Shambo, Shambo goes home."""
252,00:15:20.71,00:15:20.71,But I have no idea whether that's actually gonna happen.
253,00:15:23.12,00:15:23.12,>> You think it's a pretty good move?
254,00:15:25.29,00:15:25.29,>> Yeah. Anything that keeps me here
255,00:15:27.62,00:15:27.62,"another day sounds pretty good. Last night, I was pretty sure I"
256,00:15:31.54,00:15:31.54,"was coming back, but I wasn't positive."
257,00:15:33.75,00:15:33.75,Tonight... I don't know.
258,00:15:39.12,00:15:39.12,"However, miracles happen constantly."
259,00:15:42.17,00:15:42.17,"If one happened tonight, I would not be surprised, because the"
260,00:15:45.42,00:15:45.42,"lord freaking provides. So Shambo tonight, huh?"
261,00:15:49.42,00:15:49.42,">> That's how I'm seeing it. >> Honestly, I've got no"
262,00:15:52.62,00:15:52.62,problem with that at all. >> Shambo's dead set on getting
263,00:15:55.96,00:15:55.96,"rid of Dave, but, truthfully, I don't even need Shambo."
264,00:15:59.67,00:15:59.67,"I could let Shambo throw away her vote, just like she did"
265,00:16:03.00,00:16:03.00,"against John, and I can get rid of Shambo."
266,00:16:11.96,00:16:11.96,"Yup, yup. That's what Russ said."
267,00:16:14.38,00:16:14.38,>> Sure. >> Sure. He just asked.
268,00:16:17.08,00:16:17.08,">> Yeah, let's do it. >> David, they're not starting"
269,00:16:21.21,00:16:21.21,to gun for me. They've been gunning for me
270,00:16:23.08,00:16:23.08,since day one. It's 'cause I'm the Sham with
271,00:16:25.75,00:16:25.75,the plan. It's hard to compete with me.
272,00:16:28.00,00:16:28.00,"I'll be happy watching Dave get his torch snuffed, because that"
273,00:16:31.96,00:16:31.96,guy drives me absolutely bananas.
274,00:16:35.79,00:16:35.79,I believe what Russ says... >> This is what's going on.
275,00:16:38.75,00:16:38.75,">> ...but if Dave is not voted off tonight, I think Russ and I"
276,00:16:42.08,00:16:42.08,are gonna be having a chat. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
277,00:16:59.50,00:16:59.50,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
278,00:17:05.71,00:17:05.71,"Erik, Kelly, Laura and John, voted out at the last Tribal"
279,00:17:11.54,00:17:11.54,"Council. Jaison, day 31, eight people"
280,00:17:20.12,00:17:20.12,"left, the reason you vote somebody out tonight probably"
281,00:17:24.08,00:17:24.08,very different from why you voted somebody out on day two.
282,00:17:27.04,00:17:27.04,>> Yeah. Now I think it's more strategic in terms of trying
283,00:17:29.92,00:17:29.92,to get rid of some of the stronger players because they're
284,00:17:32.21,00:17:32.21,smart and are good at strategy or because they're physically
285,00:17:35.25,00:17:35.25,"able to win immunity. If there's a third reason, it"
286,00:17:38.12,00:17:38.12,"would be because of the jury, you know?"
287,00:17:40.25,00:17:40.25,"You want to have the best shot you can, if you get to that"
288,00:17:43.67,00:17:43.67,"final two or three, whatever it ends up being, of"
289,00:17:45.88,00:17:45.88,"getting votes. So as far as I'm concerned,"
290,00:17:48.17,00:17:48.17,that's probably the three criteria.
291,00:17:50.58,00:17:50.58,">> PROBST: Shambo, at the last Tribal Council, you brought up"
292,00:17:53.00,00:17:53.00,"a different reason which is, you want to vote people out of this"
293,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,game that don't deserve to go to the end.
294,00:17:58.67,00:17:58.67,"Still feel that way? >> Oh, yeah, I absolutely feel"
295,00:18:00.88,00:18:00.88,"that way. But by the same token, I"
296,00:18:03.54,00:18:03.54,"wouldn't have voted John out, not in a million years, because"
297,00:18:07.25,00:18:07.25,"he's somebody that I was aligned with, and I think I was more"
298,00:18:10.67,00:18:10.67,"blindsided than John was, truthfully."
299,00:18:13.29,00:18:13.29,">> PROBST: Great working of the jury, too. Well done."
300,00:18:16.04,00:18:16.04,">> No, this is serious. >> PROBST: Monica, what about"
301,00:18:19.38,00:18:19.38,somebody who's just unpredictable and you're
302,00:18:22.12,00:18:22.12,"getting so late in the game, you just don't know if you can"
303,00:18:25.25,00:18:25.25,count on them or not? >> I definitely think that
304,00:18:27.71,00:18:27.71,unpredictability is scary at this point in the game.
305,00:18:31.12,00:18:31.12,"We're getting low in numbers, and you want to have someone"
306,00:18:33.83,00:18:33.83,that you know you can discuss the vote with and realize who
307,00:18:38.17,00:18:38.17,do I want to see go to the end at this point?
308,00:18:41.08,00:18:41.08,">> PROBST: So, Dave, what do you have to do at this point to"
309,00:18:43.83,00:18:43.83,stay in this game? >> I think you've got to get
310,00:18:46.54,00:18:46.54,"people on your side and say, ""I think you have a better shot at"
311,00:18:51.00,00:18:51.00,a million dollars with me than you have with this person over
312,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,here who you're currently aligned with.
313,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,">> PROBST: Russell, Dave laid out a very clear and"
314,00:19:04.21,00:19:04.21,"potentially effective strategy: ""You are better with me, let's"
315,00:19:08.17,00:19:08.17,"go to the end."" >> I appreciate that."
316,00:19:10.21,00:19:10.21,"It's a good strategy. The fact of the matter is, if"
317,00:19:13.25,00:19:13.25,"you know some people are going to get all the votes, then you"
318,00:19:15.88,00:19:15.88,want to get rid of them. That's probably the most
319,00:19:18.79,00:19:18.79,"important move of the game to me, even more than a physical"
320,00:19:22.17,00:19:22.17,"threat. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
321,00:19:26.21,00:19:26.21,"to the vote. Jaison, for the second Tribal"
322,00:19:28.46,00:19:28.46,"Council in a row, you have the immunity necklace."
323,00:19:30.42,00:19:30.42,You can choose to assign it to somebody else.
324,00:19:32.33,00:19:32.33,">> No, I'm keeping it. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for"
325,00:19:34.67,00:19:34.67,Jaison. Everybody else is fair game.
326,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,"It is time to vote. Mick, you're up."
327,00:19:57.42,00:19:57.42,">> See you later, Dave. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
328,00:20:26.33,00:20:26.33,votes. >> PROBST: If anybody has the
329,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83,"hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be"
330,00:20:39.46,00:20:39.46,the time to do so. All right.
331,00:20:45.17,00:20:45.17,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
332,00:20:47.04,00:20:47.04,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
333,00:20:49.12,00:20:49.12,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
334,00:20:55.17,00:20:55.17,First vote... Shambo.
335,00:21:01.25,00:21:01.25,"Dave. One vote Shambo, one vote Dave."
336,00:21:07.25,00:21:07.25,"Dave. Two votes Dave, one vote Shambo."
337,00:21:13.17,00:21:13.17,"Dave. That's three votes Dave, one"
338,00:21:15.04,00:21:15.04,vote Shambo. Dave.
339,00:21:21.17,00:21:21.17,"Four votes Dave, one vote Shambo."
340,00:21:25.58,00:21:25.58,"11th person voted out, and the fifth member of our jury..."
341,00:21:28.42,00:21:28.42,Dave. That's five. That's enough.

350,00:22:13.33,00:22:13.33,Good night. >> I wanted a chance to play
351,00:22:24.79,00:22:24.79,the game. I played my hardest.
352,00:22:26.96,00:22:26.96,I went full on. Russell just played a better
353,00:22:29.04,00:22:29.04,game. I think we all underestimated
354,00:22:31.04,00:22:31.04,"Russell. Man, he's just born to play this"
355,00:22:33.62,00:22:33.62,game. I'm bummed that it's over.

363,00:22:54.17,00:22:54.17,"going to send me home, 'cause that's what I would do."
364,00:23:25.50,00:23:25.50,">> It's a no-brainer. Well, Brett is just, uh, way too"
365,00:23:29.21,00:23:29.21,likable. He's a nice guy.
366,00:23:31.17,00:23:31.17,"He would almost get 100% of the vote, so Brett is a huge threat"
367,00:23:34.33,00:23:34.33,in this game. That's why I got to get rid of

376,00:24:02.21,00:24:02.21,"think it's developed now to where Russell is definitely, you"
377,00:24:04.75,00:24:04.75,"know, the leader of us strategically, for sure."
378,00:24:08.08,00:24:08.08,"I got to be thinking, he's a game player."
379,00:24:10.08,00:24:10.08,He plays hard. Maybe he's thinking of taking
380,00:24:12.08,00:24:12.08,"other people to the jury, um, with him so that he has a better"
381,00:24:14.75,00:24:14.75,shot. I'm not going to be caught off
382,00:24:16.38,00:24:16.38,guard. That's the only thing.
383,00:24:18.67,00:24:18.67,">> Right. >>> And I mean, I got to"
384,00:24:20.67,00:24:20.67,wonder... >> It makes me nervous thinking
385,00:24:22.67,00:24:22.67,"you're nervous, to tell you the truth."
386,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,"Mick is freaking out, and when you freak out that much, you'll"
387,00:24:28.12,00:24:28.12,flip. That worries me that he's going
388,00:24:31.12,00:24:31.12,"to send me home, 'cause that's what I would do."
389,00:24:38.00,00:24:38.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready for another"
390,00:24:47.50,00:24:47.50,immunity challenge? >> Let's make it happen.
391,00:24:50.17,00:24:50.17,">> PROBST: First things first, Jaison."
392,00:24:52.17,00:24:52.17,You know I'm taking it. >> Yup.
393,00:24:59.21,00:24:59.21,">> PROBST: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
394,00:25:02.21,00:25:02.21,"For today's challenge, you must race out into the water,"
395,00:25:05.54,00:25:05.54,retrieve one of your three bags and race back.
396,00:25:08.38,00:25:08.38,You must then use a plank to launch your bag into your
397,00:25:11.21,00:25:11.21,basket. First person to get all three
398,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,"bags in their basket wins immunity, is safe tonight at"
399,00:25:18.25,00:25:18.25,Tribal Council and guaranteed a one in six shot at a million
400,00:25:21.12,00:25:21.12,dollars. You guys ready to get to it?
401,00:25:23.62,00:25:23.62,>> Yup. >> Let's do it.
402,00:25:25.58,00:25:25.58,">> PROBST: All right, we'll draw for spots, and we'll get"
403,00:25:27.88,00:25:27.88,started. Here we go.
404,00:25:33.12,00:25:33.12,For immunity. Survivors ready?
405,00:25:38.46,00:25:38.46,"Go! Retrieving one bag at a time,"
406,00:25:43.12,00:25:43.12,then racing back. Jaison untying those knots.
407,00:25:48.17,00:25:48.17,Jaison has his first bag. Mick has his first bag.
408,00:25:53.33,00:25:53.33,Brett right behind. Russell's heading back.
409,00:25:58.67,00:25:58.67,"Monica has a bag. Shambo, Natalie bringing up the"
410,00:26:03.08,00:26:03.08,rear. You got to hop on that plank to
411,00:26:07.92,00:26:07.92,get your bag in the basket. 33 days.
412,00:26:15.42,00:26:15.42,Clearly evident. Natalie really struggling.
413,00:26:19.50,00:26:19.50,Struggling just to keep her clothes on.
414,00:26:21.92,00:26:21.92,Lost a lot of weight out here. Keep digging.
415,00:26:26.12,00:26:26.12,Let's go. You've been out here 33 days.
416,00:26:28.08,00:26:28.08,Don't stop now. Brett gets his first bag in the
417,00:26:31.54,00:26:31.54,basket. Brett heading back out on the
418,00:26:34.00,00:26:34.00,course. Mick has his first bag in the
419,00:26:38.04,00:26:38.04,basket. Mick heading back out.
420,00:26:40.88,00:26:40.88,Mick gaining some ground on Brett now.
421,00:26:46.21,00:26:46.21,Russell has his first bag in the basket.
422,00:26:48.58,00:26:48.58,Russell now out on the course. Shambo gets her first bag in
423,00:26:53.12,00:26:53.12,"the basket. Brett, Mick, Russell, all with"
424,00:26:57.96,00:26:57.96,"their second bags. Jaison, Monica, Natalie-- still"
425,00:27:03.21,00:27:03.21,no luck with their first bags. Brett back with his second bag.
426,00:27:11.92,00:27:11.92,Mick right on his heels. Brett connects.
427,00:27:18.17,00:27:18.17,He's heading out for his third and final bag.
428,00:27:21.88,00:27:21.88,Mick right behind. It is Brett and Mick heading
429,00:27:25.62,00:27:25.62,out for their final bags. Russell back with his second
430,00:27:28.96,00:27:28.96,bag. >> In!
431,00:27:32.12,00:27:32.12,>> PROBST: Jaison has his first bag in the basket.
432,00:27:36.75,00:27:36.75,Russell has his second bag in the basket.
433,00:27:40.67,00:27:40.67,Natalie's now out. Monica the only one left who has
434,00:27:44.17,00:27:44.17,not got a bag in her basket. It is coming down to Brett and
435,00:27:48.62,00:27:48.62,"Mick, both coming back with their final bags."
436,00:27:52.04,00:27:52.04,Brett kicking it into high gear now.
437,00:27:54.83,00:27:54.83,"He's sprinting back. Mick, you better dig."
438,00:28:00.17,00:28:00.17,Brett back with his final bag. Brett can win it.
439,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,Mick for the win. You don't want to go home
440,00:28:07.54,00:28:07.54,"tonight. Mick, just short."
441,00:28:13.46,00:28:13.46,"Brett wins individual immunity! Brett, come on over."
442,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,">> Good job, Brett. >> Good job, B."
443,00:28:25.67,00:28:25.67,">> PROBST: After 33 days, Brett does not have to worry about"
444,00:28:30.67,00:28:30.67,"going home tonight. Mick, Russell, Natalie, Shambo,"
445,00:28:34.79,00:28:34.79,"Monica, Jaison, one of the six of you will go home."
446,00:28:38.71,00:28:38.71,I'll see you at Tribal tonight. >> Brett has shown that he's
447,00:28:43.08,00:28:43.08,"got new life, and if he wins enough immunity challenges, he"
448,00:28:46.54,00:28:46.54,could put a wrench in our entire game plan.
449,00:28:48.83,00:28:48.83,"Now we got to get Monica, which is fine, but this could be a"
450,00:28:52.04,00:28:52.04,"problem. >> Thank you, my friend."
451,00:29:12.17,00:29:12.17,">> Baby boy, busts out a move! >> Brett! Brett!"
452,00:29:16.71,00:29:16.71,">> Well, finally got my time. >> Brett, good job."
453,00:29:18.92,00:29:18.92,">> You didn't want to go home today, did you?"
454,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,>> I was so pissed. I just couldn't get the freaking
455,00:29:25.04,00:29:25.04,thing in the basket. >> I know.
456,00:29:31.62,00:29:31.62,>> We don't even got to say a name.
457,00:29:33.62,00:29:33.62,We know what's up-- Monica. >> Yeah.
458,00:29:35.62,00:29:35.62,">> It's done. >> Today, Brett won immunity,"
459,00:29:38.21,00:29:38.21,"and it totally sucks for me. At this point, it puts me in a"
460,00:29:42.25,00:29:42.25,bad situation where I seem like the next viable option to go
461,00:29:46.04,00:29:46.04,"home, but I'm going to do everything in my power to make"
462,00:29:48.46,00:29:48.46,sure that that doesn't happen. >> Just wondering how
463,00:29:54.79,00:29:54.79,"comfortable you feel making it to the final three, 'cause I was"
464,00:29:58.04,00:29:58.04,"thinking, if I was in your shoes, I would get worried a"
465,00:30:01.00,00:30:01.00,little bit. >> Mm-hmm.
466,00:30:03.00,00:30:03.00,">> You know, you are a very likable person, and that, you"
467,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,"know, obviously, can be a threat, you know..."
468,00:30:07.04,00:30:07.04,>> Yeah. >> ...when it comes down to the
469,00:30:09.04,00:30:09.04,jury. >> Right.
470,00:30:17.29,00:30:17.29,">> See, I don't know if you've even thought about that."
471,00:30:19.54,00:30:19.54,>> Are you kidding me? I've thought about it a ton.
472,00:30:23.25,00:30:23.25,"It's like, a little kid sees a snake, and the snake's, like,"
473,00:30:27.33,00:30:27.33,"""Hey, come play with me. I'm not going to bite you."""
474,00:30:29.33,00:30:29.33,"And the kid starts playing with the snake, and the snake bites"
475,00:30:31.33,00:30:31.33,"him, and he's, like, ""What happened? You said you weren't"
476,00:30:33.33,00:30:33.33,"going to bite me."" He's, like, ""I'm a snake."
477,00:30:35.33,00:30:35.33,"That's what I do."" >> Hmm."
478,00:30:37.33,00:30:37.33,">> So, I am very skeptical. There is definitely a part of"
479,00:30:41.96,00:30:41.96,me that wants to make a big move and definitely thought about
480,00:30:45.04,00:30:45.04,the possibility of getting rid of Russell.
481,00:30:49.46,00:30:49.46,"There are emotional and moral attachments to people, but I"
482,00:30:52.08,00:30:52.08,"mean, every night I sit there, and I visualize in my head my"
483,00:30:57.21,00:30:57.21,name with one million dollars written in front of it.
484,00:31:00.62,00:31:00.62,"So, I mean, it's tough. >> If you want to, you know,"
485,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,"make a big move and, you know, blindside someone that might"
486,00:31:07.62,00:31:07.62,"want to take you out, you have the opportunity to do so."
487,00:31:24.88,00:31:24.88,">> He's a player, man. I mean, it would make more sense"
488,00:31:28.17,00:31:28.17,"for him to take, like, Natalie and Shambo."
489,00:31:35.12,00:31:35.12,>> I just don't want to be off guard and not worry about
490,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,"things, you know. >> I'm just telling you."
491,00:31:52.25,00:31:52.25,"I mean, you need to... (Russell mumbles)"
492,00:31:54.25,00:31:54.25,>> ...put people on your jury that are going to vote for you.
493,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,>> My position is the best in this game right now.
494,00:32:00.04,00:32:00.04,>> Yeah. >> So why would I jeopardize
495,00:32:02.04,00:32:02.04,"that...? >> Well, I think you are"
496,00:32:04.04,00:32:04.04,jeopardizing your game by taking people like Jaison who's just
497,00:32:06.08,00:32:06.08,"counting down the days to day 36, when it's your final day to"
498,00:32:08.08,00:32:08.08,play the idol. >> How do you think that?
499,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,">> He told me so, but I'm telling you right now that I "
500,00:32:12.08,00:32:12.08,did not sit in that... >> He told me it on the beach.
501,00:32:19.12,00:32:19.12,"He said, ""Well, he can only play that idol until day 36."""
502,00:32:21.46,00:32:21.46,"So, I mean, these are the people you have in your court."
503,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,I'm surprised you want to put me on the jury.
504,00:32:26.58,00:32:26.58,>> Yeah. >> I can make or break you on
505,00:32:28.75,00:32:28.75,"the jury, really. >> Because, uh..."
506,00:32:52.08,00:32:52.08,>> You told her I made a lot of money?
507,00:32:54.08,00:32:54.08,Why would you do something stupid like that?
508,00:32:55.58,00:32:55.58,>> I did not... I didn't do that.
509,00:32:57.54,00:32:57.54,>> Who told her? >> Someone else told her.
510,00:32:59.54,00:32:59.54,I never told her what you did. >> How do I know?
511,00:33:06.21,00:33:06.21,>> Yeah. How come all of a sudden Monica
512,00:33:08.75,00:33:08.75,thinks I make a lot of money for some reason?
513,00:33:13.12,00:33:13.12,">> Uh, Jaison? >> She told me what I do for a"
514,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,living. I want to know what happened.
515,00:33:29.33,00:33:29.33,"You know, did you tell her that you would get rid of me after I"
516,00:33:32.42,00:33:32.42,get rid of the idol? >> No.
517,00:33:34.46,00:33:34.46,>> Why would she tell me that? >> Because she's trying to stay
518,00:33:36.38,00:33:36.38,in the game. Russell was so angry.
519,00:33:41.38,00:33:41.38,I might have made a mistake and told her what he does for a
520,00:33:44.58,00:33:44.58,"living. I honestly don't remember, but"
521,00:33:47.04,00:33:47.04,"now I'm nervous that Russell is going to come after me, so we've"
522,00:33:52.88,00:33:52.88,"got to nip this in the bud soon. We got to start thinking about,"
523,00:33:57.46,00:33:57.46,"you know, Russell is Russell, so we got to, we got to watch out"
524,00:33:59.67,00:33:59.67,"because... >> Oh, my word."
525,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,">> The three of us-- myself, Mick, and Natalie-- we got to"
526,00:34:10.92,00:34:10.92,make a tough decision tonight. >> It just makes me mad and I
527,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,like it. >> You like being pissed off?
528,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,">> Hell, yes. Making me mad fuels my fire."
529,00:34:23.12,00:34:23.12,"Monica, she had to run her little piehole."
530,00:34:26.17,00:34:26.17,"The little bitch needs to be sent home tonight, but now I've"
531,00:34:30.38,00:34:30.38,"got to worry about Jaison, so at Tribal Council, if I'm feeling"
532,00:34:34.62,00:34:34.62,"any kind of heat, I have the immunity idol."
533,00:34:37.33,00:34:37.33,I'm gonna walk in there and if I feel any kind of threat
534,00:34:40.92,00:34:40.92,"whatsoever, I'll stand up and play it."
535,00:34:56.00,00:34:56.00,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
536,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,"Erik, Kelly, Laura, John, and Dave, voted out at the last"
537,00:35:09.58,00:35:09.58,"Tribal Council. What's going on, Russell?"
538,00:35:23.12,00:35:23.12,>> I just found a little pretty necklace.
539,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,"Thought I'd wear it, make me look a little better out here."
540,00:35:29.12,00:35:29.12,">> PROBST: Shambo, is that a surprise to you?"
541,00:35:31.71,00:35:31.71,>> Everything he does is a surprise.
542,00:35:34.38,00:35:34.38,>> PROBST: Anybody else shocked by Russell putting on what
543,00:35:37.71,00:35:37.71,appears to be the hidden immunity idol?
544,00:35:39.88,00:35:39.88,>> Absolutely not. I think Russell's getting a
545,00:35:42.38,00:35:42.38,"little cocky up in here. >> You see, some people think"
546,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,that this right here puts a target on my back.
547,00:35:50.12,00:35:50.12,I beg to differ about that. I think it puts a target on
548,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,somebody else's back. >> He's humble.
549,00:35:56.83,00:35:56.83,(Monica laughs) >> PROBST: He does have safety
550,00:35:59.92,00:35:59.92,around his neck if he chooses to use it.
551,00:36:02.96,00:36:02.96,>> Nobody really knows what you're gonna do with it.
552,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,That's what makes it so powerful.
553,00:36:07.54,00:36:07.54,">> PROBST: Brett, things have really changed, haven't they?"
554,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,">> Yeah, I would say that, you know, by his gestures, he feels"
555,00:36:14.33,00:36:14.33,"pretty comfortable, and as of right now, they do have the"
556,00:36:18.04,00:36:18.04,"numbers, but when you get comfortable in this game, things"
557,00:36:20.62,00:36:20.62,"can come and haunt you, so you got to stay humble in this game."
558,00:36:24.62,00:36:24.62,">> PROBST: Shambo, what was it like at camp after the"
559,00:36:27.12,00:36:27.12,challenge? >> It was probably the worst day
560,00:36:30.54,00:36:30.54,that we have had prior to a Tribal.
561,00:36:33.08,00:36:33.08,>> PROBST: Wow. >> Russell got his feathers
562,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,"ruffled, and it was just... It was..."
563,00:36:37.25,00:36:37.25,>> Awesome. >> It was not pretty.
564,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,It was ugly. >> PROBST: Russell?
565,00:36:42.08,00:36:42.08,">> Monica tells me, ""If you vote me out, I ain't putting your"
566,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"name down for the million dollars, and I'm gonna talk to"
567,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,"everybody else; they ain't putting your name down."""
568,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,"Well, you know what? You're only making me vote you"
569,00:36:51.54,00:36:51.54,out now because of what you said.
570,00:36:54.08,00:36:54.08,">> You know, Russell came into the merge and basically tried to"
571,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"push a lot of buttons, and I haven't seen Russell's buttons"
572,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,"pushed, but today he was huffing and puffing all over camp."
573,00:37:04.58,00:37:04.58,"""Did you say this about me?"" I mean, he was fuming, fuming."
574,00:37:08.96,00:37:08.96,>> PROBST: And what about that delights you so much?
575,00:37:12.21,00:37:12.21,">> Basically, I couldn't help but have a sense of pride,"
576,00:37:15.17,00:37:15.17,knowing that if I put a scintilla of doubt in their
577,00:37:18.21,00:37:18.21,"minds of trust, then I accomplished my mission."
578,00:37:21.08,00:37:21.08,">> PROBST: Russell, a little bit of teacher-student."
579,00:37:24.38,00:37:24.38,"You taught her so well, she graduated and said, ""How about"
580,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,"this?"" >> Seeing what I've seen today,"
581,00:37:29.75,00:37:29.75,"if I would have been on her tribe in the beginning, we would"
582,00:37:32.67,00:37:32.67,"have been dangerous for sure. You know, she got me pissed off,"
583,00:37:36.62,00:37:36.62,"so if she would have played that hard this entire game, she would"
584,00:37:39.71,00:37:39.71,be the one in charge right now. >> Or I could be going home
585,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,earlier. >> But I've been playing hard
586,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,this entire game and I am still here.
587,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,">> Because of idols. >> Yeah, well, that's playing"
588,00:37:48.92,00:37:48.92,"hard. >> PROBST: Russell, a little"
589,00:37:51.29,00:37:51.29,concerned that Monica could have stirred up something that points
590,00:37:54.38,00:37:54.38,fingers now at you? >> Not at all.
591,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,"I know that everything is fine, and that might be my mistake in"
592,00:38:00.38,00:38:00.38,"the game, but I don't think so. >> PROBST: Mick, when Monica's"
593,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,"over there stirring it up, you have to be going, ""This is not"
594,00:38:06.75,00:38:06.75,"good."" >> Yeah, of course, absolutely,"
595,00:38:09.92,00:38:09.92,and we're not that shortsighted to say we're all four going to
596,00:38:13.04,00:38:13.04,"win a million bucks, so your wheels start spinning a little"
597,00:38:16.08,00:38:16.08,"bit. I mean, all of a sudden, I'm"
598,00:38:18.17,00:38:18.17,here in front of the jury with so-and-so versus so-and-so.
599,00:38:20.79,00:38:20.79,You got to think about stuff like that.
600,00:38:23.00,00:38:23.00,"If you're not, then you're stupid."
601,00:38:26.29,00:38:26.29,">> PROBST: Well, it sounds like it was an interesting afternoon,"
602,00:38:30.00,00:38:30.00,and the big question seems to be: did Monica's scrambling pay
603,00:38:32.04,00:38:32.04,"off? Brett, you have the immunity"
604,00:38:33.75,00:38:33.75,necklace. I know you're not giving that
605,00:38:35.67,00:38:35.67,up. >> I think I'm gonna hold on to
606,00:38:37.75,00:38:37.75,it. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for
607,00:38:39.46,00:38:39.46,Brett. Everybody else is fair game.
608,00:38:42.08,00:38:42.08,"It's time to vote. Brett, you're up."
609,00:38:59.08,00:38:59.08,">> Stupid, stupid little girl. Bad strategy."
610,00:39:17.17,00:39:17.17,>> Watch out 'cause you have a huge target on your back.
611,00:39:24.21,00:39:24.21,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
612,00:39:38.08,00:39:38.08,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
613,00:39:41.38,00:39:41.38,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
614,00:39:52.79,00:39:52.79,"Okay. Once the votes are read, the"
615,00:39:56.08,00:39:56.08,decision is final. Person voted out will be asked
616,00:39:57.96,00:39:57.96,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
617,00:40:00.21,00:40:00.21,I'll read the votes. First vote.
618,00:40:07.25,00:40:07.25,Monica. Russell.
619,00:40:11.04,00:40:11.04,"One vote-- Monica, one vote-- Russell."
620,00:40:16.00,00:40:16.00,"Monica. Two votes-- Monica, one vote--"
621,00:40:19.04,00:40:19.04,Russell. Russell.
622,00:40:24.21,00:40:24.21,"We're tied. Two votes-- Monica, two votes--"
623,00:40:26.12,00:40:26.12,Russell. Monica.
624,00:40:34.25,00:40:34.25,"That's three votes-- Monica, two votes-- Russell."
625,00:40:43.08,00:40:43.08,12th person voted out and the sixth member of our jury--
626,00:40:46.21,00:40:46.21,"Monica. That's four, that's enough."
627,00:40:48.29,00:40:48.29,"You need to bring me your torch. Monica, the tribe has spoken."
628,00:41:13.08,00:41:13.08,"Well, there are six of you left in this game now."
629,00:41:16.21,00:41:16.21,"Not everybody's going to make it to the final, so while it may"
630,00:41:18.92,00:41:18.92,"not have worked for Monica tonight, going to be a lot more"
631,00:41:21.88,00:41:21.88,"scrambling to come. Grab your torches, head back to"
632,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,camp. Good night.
633,00:41:37.83,00:41:37.83,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
634,00:41:44.12,00:41:44.12,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor.
635,00:41:46.12,00:41:46.12,>> I'm in! >> Maybe something is going on
636,00:41:47.67,00:41:47.67,"with Mick, Natalie, and Brett. I have to blindside everybody."
637,00:41:51.67,00:41:51.67,">> PROBST: With only two episodes left, the alliances are"
638,00:41:54.04,00:41:54.04,shifting. >> This is the team.
639,00:41:55.92,00:41:55.92,"Me, Jaison-- we are running the show."
640,00:41:59.12,00:41:59.12,>> There's a chance that Russell's lying to me and it
641,00:42:01.12,00:42:01.12,scares the hell out of me. >> I am shocked.
642,00:42:09.12,00:42:09.12,"I mean, 33 days, and I feel amazing."
643,00:42:12.25,00:42:12.25,"I think I made it really far in this game, and I definitely went"
644,00:42:15.83,00:42:15.83,out causing some conflict in the Foa Foas.
645,00:42:19.62,00:42:19.62,"I think they all distrust each other a little bit more, and I'm"
646,00:42:22.42,00:42:22.42,proud to say that I caused that and that I stirred the pot a
647,00:42:25.04,00:42:25.04,"little bit, even if it was on my way out."
