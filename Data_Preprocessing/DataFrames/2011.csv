246,00:15:23.83,00:15:23.83,immediately.Because they hid... they hid an
247,00:15:26.12,00:15:26.12,immunity idol from me.They didn't let me know about
248,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,it.You know what?
249,00:15:30.21,00:15:30.21,I'm not letting them know aboutit.
250,00:15:32.46,00:15:32.46,I am the king of hidden immunityidols.

261,00:16:34.12,00:16:34.12,>> Stick with me.I could take you places.
262,00:16:37.75,00:16:37.75,>> Knowing that Russell has theidol could be a little bit of
263,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,"ammunition for me, but right nowI can't tell anybody, because I"
264,00:16:44.50,00:16:44.50,can't trust anybody to not takea little bit of information that
265,00:16:48.58,00:16:48.58,they get and use it against me.>> But now you trust me.
266,00:16:51.79,00:16:51.79,>> I trust you.>> We are going to the final

270,00:17:01.25,00:17:01.25,"me the hidden immunity idol.So it's just, it's really tough."
271,00:17:04.83,00:17:04.83,It was a tough decision to make.>> This is real.
272,00:17:07.75,00:17:07.75,>> All right.>> Tyson was first-- he was in
273,00:17:33.25,00:17:33.25,my alliance.Then they took out Boston Rob--
274,00:17:35.25,00:17:35.25,he was in my alliance.They took out Courtney before we
275,00:17:38.17,00:17:38.17,came here because they knew thatif me and Courtney came over
276,00:17:41.38,00:17:41.38,"here, they were done.>> Okay."
277,00:17:44.21,00:17:44.21,">> So if I flip with you guysand make it five against four,"
278,00:17:48.12,00:17:48.12,"it's either got to be Danielle,Parvati or Russell."
279,00:17:51.58,00:17:51.58,When Tyson went and then BostonRob went and then Courtney left
280,00:17:54.96,00:17:54.96,"me, I was, like, I'm done.But now that they took out J.T."
281,00:17:59.58,00:17:59.58,"and now I can jump to them andbe five against four, now is the"
282,00:18:03.46,00:18:03.46,perfect time for me to make mymove.
283,00:18:06.00,00:18:06.00,">> In terms of the idol, Iagree with you-- Danielle has"
284,00:18:08.71,00:18:08.71,it.>> And she's greedy.
285,00:18:10.21,00:18:10.21,>> I also agree she's not gonnagive it away.
286,00:18:12.04,00:18:12.04,"I know Danielle has the hiddenimmunity idol, or will, because"
287,00:18:14.79,00:18:14.79,she has the clue.So we have to assume she's gonna
288,00:18:18.17,00:18:18.17,find it and she'll have it inher possession.
289,00:18:21.17,00:18:21.17,But if Danielle doesn't winimmunity today-- which I'm gonna
290,00:18:24.54,00:18:24.54,try my damndest to keep her fromit-- don't you think she'll play
291,00:18:28.25,00:18:28.25,the idol tonight?>> She don't think she's in
292,00:18:30.71,00:18:30.71,"bad shape.They won't tell me till, like,"
293,00:18:33.12,00:18:33.12,"an hour before who it is,because they don't tell me"
294,00:18:35.42,00:18:35.42,nothing.>> So we need to make sure they
295,00:18:37.83,00:18:37.83,"don't think you're flipping.So the thing is, we need you."
296,00:18:41.71,00:18:41.71,"We need you, and if you want todo this, do we first take out"
297,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,Russell or Parvati?Tonight.
298,00:18:55.38,00:18:55.38,">> What, did Colby try to talkto you any?"
299,00:18:58.12,00:18:58.12,">> No. He-he's kind of, like,uptight."
300,00:19:02.00,00:19:02.00,"Like Jerri said, he, like,doesn't have no personality."
301,00:19:04.29,00:19:04.29,>> Yeah.>> I know I told you I haven't
302,00:19:06.46,00:19:06.46,talked to him since the day wegot here-- that's why he's dying
303,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,to talk to me.>> We have five votes right now.
304,00:19:11.38,00:19:11.38,>> Mm-hmm.>> We have six votes.
305,00:19:13.38,00:19:13.38,">> Oh.>> Like, if you would flip, and"
306,00:19:15.50,00:19:15.50,all of a sudden we get fivevotes and you vote another
307,00:19:17.96,00:19:17.96,way... that would be...>> It wouldn't matter.
308,00:19:21.38,00:19:21.38,>> ...bad for the game.>> No. No. Hold up.
309,00:19:24.29,00:19:24.29,"You're doing math wrong.>> No... no, I'm saying we have"
310,00:19:27.04,00:19:27.04,six people.We have one person from their
311,00:19:28.88,00:19:28.88,"tribe voting with us today.>> Oh, okay."
312,00:19:34.12,00:19:34.12,">> But anyway, I trust you.(Sandra laughs)"
313,00:19:38.12,00:19:38.12,">> If I stay with the Villains,I'm top five, I'm not moving up"
314,00:19:41.33,00:19:41.33,from there-- because they're notwilling to get rid of Russell.
315,00:19:45.04,00:19:45.04,That's why I have to flip to theHeroes-- because I need to get
316,00:19:50.12,00:19:50.12,Russell out.Russell? You want Russell gone?
317,00:19:52.46,00:19:52.46,>> Yeah.>> Russell's gone. He's gone.
318,00:19:54.25,00:19:54.25,">> All four of us are going,all four of us will vote for..."
319,00:19:57.00,00:19:57.00,">> Yeah, but Russell just toldme now, somebody from them"
320,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,already came to us again.I'm hoping that one of those
321,00:20:01.62,00:20:01.62,"girls is lying, and thatthey're gonna stick with you."
322,00:20:03.62,00:20:03.62,They need to stick with you orthis won't work.
323,00:20:06.83,00:20:06.83,"If they don't stick with you,they're going home one after the"
324,00:20:08.92,00:20:08.92,other.So it's up to you.
325,00:20:10.96,00:20:10.96,>> I'd rather...Which do you want?
326,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,I'd rather put Russell's assout there.
327,00:20:14.79,00:20:14.79,"My gosh, alls it will take isSandra to switch over to our"
328,00:20:18.21,00:20:18.21,"side, there's five votes forRussell, we could get Russell"
329,00:20:22.92,00:20:22.92,out of this game!The guy is a piece of garbage.
330,00:20:28.12,00:20:28.12,>> Sandra's the one that came tome.
331,00:20:30.12,00:20:30.12,"And then this morning, she justspilled the beans of why she's"
332,00:20:32.83,00:20:32.83,"so sick of all of them,including Russell."
333,00:20:35.00,00:20:35.00,Really wants to get rid ofRussell. Um...
334,00:20:37.46,00:20:37.46,>> So we vote tonight forwhoever she wants?
335,00:20:40.04,00:20:40.04,">> Yeah. I mean, this is it.So... I don't see any reason why"
336,00:20:44.79,00:20:44.79,Sandra would bluff me at thispoint.
337,00:20:47.04,00:20:47.04,If Sandra's telling me thetruth.
338,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,"Who knows, she could be playingme for the Villains."
339,00:20:51.33,00:20:51.33,"But if she's telling me thetruth, you know, she's ready to"
340,00:20:53.71,00:20:53.71,come on board and play ball withus.
341,00:20:56.25,00:20:56.25,"So this changes everything, in ahurry."
342,00:20:58.58,00:20:58.58,"So what we've got to do is gointo immunity, try to win to"
343,00:21:02.12,00:21:02.12,prevent the Villain from gettingit.
344,00:21:04.17,00:21:04.17,"But if we don't, we hope thatSandra's telling us the truth,"
345,00:21:07.25,00:21:07.25,"we hope she's gonna vote withus, and in that case, we will"
346,00:21:09.71,00:21:09.71,either vote out Russell orParvati tonight.

363,00:22:32.04,00:22:32.04,experimenting.You may crash and burn a few
364,00:22:35.62,00:22:35.62,times.Don't panic if yours crumbles.
365,00:22:41.12,00:22:41.12,Don't panic if you see theperson next to you doing better.

377,00:24:20.38,00:24:20.38,right now.Russell's going to have to pick

383,00:24:44.62,00:24:44.62,Russell is out of cards.Trying to make a little pyramid
384,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,to get him at ten feet.Russell's not there.
385,00:24:51.12,00:24:51.12,Russell's going to have tohustle.

417,00:26:58.04,00:26:58.04,They look done.And Candice thinks I'm going to
418,00:27:01.08,00:27:01.08,take her to the top three.I haven't really made the
419,00:27:03.67,00:27:03.67,decision yet.So Amanda is really an
420,00:27:06.42,00:27:06.42,"aggressive, strategic player.She's kind of like Boston Rob"
421,00:27:09.75,00:27:09.75,"in a girl's body, so she has togo."
422,00:27:15.04,00:27:15.04,Let's put her name down tonight.We really ain't got to discuss

432,00:27:43.33,00:27:43.33,either way that I chose couldbe really the beginning of the
433,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,"end for me, because I was goingto make people really mad on"
434,00:27:52.25,00:27:52.25,"either side, and, uh, you know,just the fact that Russell had"
435,00:27:57.08,00:27:57.08,the immunity idol and could passit to anyone made me nervous
436,00:28:00.04,00:28:00.04,about not voting with theVillains.
437,00:28:02.75,00:28:02.75,"And, uh, so, I felt like I hadto go with the plan that was"

462,00:30:11.17,00:30:11.17,I-I... I believe that Candicebelieves that this is her only
463,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,"option, and, uh, Sandra, thesame thing, and because of that,"
464,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,they have to make the decisionto get Amanda out of here.
465,00:30:20.75,00:30:20.75,>> Right. Then it does...>> If you put Amanda's name

583,00:36:35.38,00:36:35.38,">> Yeah, I'll tell you what,she's fighting to get further in"
584,00:36:38.00,00:36:38.00,the game.If she gets further in the

596,00:37:11.92,00:37:11.92,vulnerable.I'm just trusting my alliance
597,00:37:14.04,00:37:14.04,to stay with me.But if somebody flips and they

658,00:42:16.79,00:42:16.79,I should have kept it.It would have been kept me in
