11,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,Do not believe Sandra. >> He's on the Villain side for

28,00:01:43.42,00:01:43.42,guys. (laughter)
29,00:01:45.21,00:01:45.21,"It really was, actually. >> Yeah, it was."
30,00:01:49.54,00:01:49.54,It really was. I didn't see that coming at all.
31,00:02:02.58,00:02:02.58,>> And now they got secrets going around?
32,00:02:04.58,00:02:04.58,"What the hell is up with that? So, Parv, where did you find"
33,00:02:12.33,00:02:12.33,the second idol? >> At the Outback Challenge.
34,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,"(Jerri gasps, Parvati laughs) >> And you didn't tell me"

36,00:02:20.12,00:02:20.12,>> I wanted it to be a surprise. >> It's not a surprise.
37,00:02:23.25,00:02:23.25,You lied to me. That's how I feel.
38,00:02:25.25,00:02:25.25,>> How did I lie to you? >> 'Cause you didn't tell me
39,00:02:27.38,00:02:27.38,about it. Danielle knew about it.
40,00:02:29.42,00:02:29.42,>> Your ass was never in danger. >> We found it together.
41,00:02:32.21,00:02:32.21,"We were gonna surprise you... >> Yeah, well, you surely took"
42,00:02:34.67,00:02:34.67,"the one I gave you, to save you again."
43,00:02:37.12,00:02:37.12,>> I know. I was going to save Jerri.
44,00:02:40.12,00:02:40.12,>> It pisses me off that y'all didn't tell me.
45,00:02:42.08,00:02:42.08,">> Oh, chill out. >> Hell, no!"
46,00:02:44.33,00:02:44.33,">> I didn't tell anyone. >> Whatever, whatever."
47,00:02:46.75,00:02:46.75,"Keep on... y-you can talk all you want, but it is what it is"
48,00:02:50.04,00:02:50.04,"for me. >> Okay, well, you can be mad"
49,00:02:51.67,00:02:51.67,"if you want, but I don't see any harm done in keeping it a"
50,00:02:54.33,00:02:54.33,"secret. Russell likes to be in control,"
51,00:02:57.00,00:02:57.00,'cause he thinks he's the godfather of this game.
52,00:03:00.33,00:03:00.33,And I think having me have an idol that he didn't know about
53,00:03:03.67,00:03:03.67,"made him feel like he wasn't in control, and... scared a little"
54,00:03:07.79,00:03:07.79,bit. But that's kind of what I
55,00:03:10.33,00:03:10.33,"wanted, anyways. (laughs)"
56,00:03:15.00,00:03:15.00,>> You were right-- he should've listened to...
57,00:03:17.04,00:03:17.04,">> I tried. >> Listen, um, the four of us"
58,00:03:21.04,00:03:21.04,"are good, but we're going to see what's going on there to"
59,00:03:24.17,00:03:24.17,break them up. >> All right.
60,00:03:33.25,00:03:33.25,">> There's no way you're going to break up Danielle, Parvati"
61,00:03:35.83,00:03:35.83,"and Russell. When they first came over, I"
62,00:03:39.25,00:03:39.25,"had a chance with Sandra. I tried, I went to the Heroes"
63,00:03:43.25,00:03:43.25,and tried to tell them not to trust Russell.
64,00:03:48.79,00:03:48.79,My Heroes did not want to believe me.
65,00:03:53.12,00:03:53.12,"With all that has happened, I don't know how easy it will be"
66,00:03:57.58,00:03:57.58,to pull Sandra back in. She opened the door once.
67,00:04:03.67,00:04:03.67,My only hope is to maybe get Sandra to open the door again.
68,00:04:21.12,00:04:21.12,(whales singing) >> Crazy night.
69,00:04:36.62,00:04:36.62,You guys pulled a good one. >> Yup.
70,00:04:39.17,00:04:39.17,"It was just a regular vote, regular night."
71,00:04:41.71,00:04:41.71,>> Wow. That was a good one.
72,00:04:44.58,00:04:44.58,"I'm impressed. >> But, uh, when it comes down"
73,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,"to the top six, things have to happen."
74,00:04:52.12,00:04:52.12,And right now the ship is sinking.
75,00:04:54.58,00:04:54.58,"You know that. >> Yeah, I know."
76,00:04:56.54,00:04:56.54,">> And somebody, one person, has to jump, and that one"
77,00:05:03.08,00:05:03.08,person is going to be very crucial to what happens later
78,00:05:08.00,00:05:08.00,on in the game. We don't trust Sandra right now.
79,00:05:10.38,00:05:10.38,That's why I need to pull somebody else in.
80,00:05:13.83,00:05:13.83,"And I think I can trust Candice, because Candice knows that her"
81,00:05:17.38,00:05:17.38,butt's in a sling right now and she has no other way to go.
82,00:05:22.08,00:05:22.08,"If you're the last one standing, you won't be the last one, you"
83,00:05:25.00,00:05:25.00,"won't go with number six, I can guarantee that."
84,00:05:27.96,00:05:27.96,">> Yup, yup. >> I don't want to sit here and"
85,00:05:30.58,00:05:30.58,"say you're going to go to the top three, but it's a strong"
86,00:05:33.25,00:05:33.25,"possibility. >> Well, just let me know."
87,00:05:38.29,00:05:38.29,">> Okay, I'll talk to you later. >> All right."
88,00:05:44.62,00:05:44.62,>> I think that the right way to go is Candice.
89,00:05:47.33,00:05:47.33,"One hundred percent, she's ready to freaking burn her house down."
90,00:05:53.00,00:05:53.00,It's huge in the game that we have numbers.
91,00:05:56.25,00:05:56.25,Now it doesn't even matter what Sandra wants to do because
92,00:05:59.58,00:05:59.58,"Candice is going to flip. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
93,00:06:21.50,00:06:21.50,You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?
94,00:06:23.96,00:06:23.96,>> Yes. >> PROBST: For today's

98,00:06:35.71,00:06:35.71,"One at a time, you'll slide your puck across the board."
99,00:06:39.04,00:06:39.04,The team whose puck ends up closest to the center of the
100,00:06:42.50,00:06:42.50,"""X"" wins reward. Want to know what you're"
101,00:06:44.62,00:06:44.62,playing for? >> OTHERS: Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
102,00:06:46.58,00:06:46.58,>> PROBST: Robert Louis Stevenson is most famous for

110,00:07:07.00,00:07:07.00,>> And there'll probably be a clue to the hidden immunity
111,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,"idol at today's reward, so I'm hoping and praying that myself,"
112,00:07:15.17,00:07:15.17,"Danielle, Russell or Jerri goes on that reward and finds"
113,00:07:18.71,00:07:18.71,that clue-- just to keep the power in our hands.
114,00:07:21.12,00:07:21.12,>> PROBST: Worth playing for? >> OTHERS: Yes. Yes.
115,00:07:23.25,00:07:23.25,">> PROBST: We'll draw for teams, we'll get started."

120,00:07:41.21,00:07:41.21,"Black, you're up first. Candice. >> Get it, girl."
121,00:07:43.46,00:07:43.46,>> PROBST: Candice with the first shot.
122,00:07:45.38,00:07:45.38,>> Eagle eyes. >> PROBST: Everybody gets two
123,00:07:47.12,00:07:47.12,shots. You'll go one at a time.
124,00:07:50.62,00:07:50.62,Right down the middle. Good spot-- could get knocked
125,00:07:53.25,00:07:53.25,around a little bit. Sandra with the first shot for
126,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,the red team. >> Oh.
127,00:07:59.71,00:07:59.71,>> PROBST: Sandra off the board. Danielle first up for the blue
128,00:08:03.12,00:08:03.12,team. Danielle comes up short.
129,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,"Parvati up for the black team. Red team, you're up."
130,00:08:12.33,00:08:12.33,>> Ooh! >> PROBST: Nice shot for the red
131,00:08:14.38,00:08:14.38,team. That is the mark to beat.
132,00:08:16.75,00:08:16.75,Amanda up for the blue team. Amanda comes up short.
133,00:08:20.50,00:08:20.50,">> Come on, Jerri! >> PROBST: Good toss by Jerri."
134,00:08:25.12,00:08:25.12,Red still the mark to beat. Rupert gives a toss.
135,00:08:29.12,00:08:29.12,And look at that! >> OTHERS: Oh! Whoa!
136,00:08:31.08,00:08:31.08,>> PROBST: The red team very close now.
137,00:08:33.58,00:08:33.58,Colby up for the blue team. Not quite close enough.
138,00:08:38.88,00:08:38.88,Everybody's had one toss. Round two. Candice.
139,00:08:46.50,00:08:46.50,>> Oh! >> Candice was trying to knock
140,00:08:48.54,00:08:48.54,those reds right off the board. Good idea. Didn't work.
141,00:08:51.79,00:08:51.79,Sandra up for the red team. That was just a wasted shot
142,00:08:56.62,00:08:56.62,"there. Blue, you're up."
143,00:08:59.33,00:08:59.33,"And a nice toss! (shouts, clapping)"
144,00:09:01.92,00:09:01.92,Danielle knocks one red peg out of the way.
145,00:09:04.92,00:09:04.92,The other red peg is still the closest by about a half an inch.
146,00:09:08.29,00:09:08.29,"Parvati, your last shot. Nothing changes after that shot."
147,00:09:13.83,00:09:13.83,Russell up for the red team. Oh... Russell.
148,00:09:17.50,00:09:17.50,>> Lame. >> PROBST: On purpose?
149,00:09:19.12,00:09:19.12,">> Right dead in the middle for the ""X."""

152,00:09:28.21,00:09:28.21,This is the last shot for the black team.
153,00:09:32.08,00:09:32.08,Good toss but doesn't help. Black team is out of it now
154,00:09:34.88,00:09:34.88,unless something happens. Rupert with the last toss for
155,00:09:39.08,00:09:39.08,the red team. Comes up short.
156,00:09:42.54,00:09:42.54,One shot left in this challenge. It belongs to Colby Donaldson.
157,00:09:47.92,00:09:47.92,You know what you have to do. You either need to get rid of
158,00:09:50.79,00:09:50.79,this red puck or get yours in tighter.
159,00:09:59.21,00:09:59.21,>> Yeah! Yeah! >> PROBST: Colby does it for the

165,00:10:15.33,00:10:15.33,">> We're eating all the rice, so don't come back looking for it."
166,00:10:18.25,00:10:18.25,">> PROBST: All right, Colby, Danielle, Amanda, big reward."
167,00:10:21.54,00:10:21.54,"Nice job. Grab your stuff, head out."
168,00:10:23.62,00:10:23.62,Enjoy it. >> Thank you.

170,00:10:37.04,00:10:37.04,Stevenson's home. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote 13

175,00:10:56.21,00:10:56.21,was finding the clue to the hidden immunity idol.

177,00:11:00.92,00:11:00.92,"Because Parvati played two last time, there has to be one in"
178,00:11:03.83,00:11:03.83,"play this time. So the whole time, I was"
179,00:11:07.17,00:11:07.17,"thinking, ""Oh, my God, where could this clue be?"""
180,00:11:09.67,00:11:09.67,"Like, I am not leaving here without it."
181,00:11:12.08,00:11:12.08,I have to get it. (dramatic music playing)
182,00:11:21.71,00:11:21.71,"Sitting on the bed, watching Treasure Island, I didn't enjoy"
183,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,"any of it. I was too busy thinking, ""Where"
184,00:11:27.46,00:11:27.46,"could this clue be? It's got to be in this room."""
185,00:11:31.83,00:11:31.83,">> Popcorn's good, huh? >> Yeah, it's really good."
186,00:11:44.46,00:11:44.46,Wow. I found the clue in the bowl of
187,00:11:48.88,00:11:48.88,popcorn. I am freaking out.
188,00:11:51.92,00:11:51.92,"This is, like, so much power right now."
189,00:11:54.12,00:11:54.12,This could be a million dollars. But Amanda was really
190,00:12:00.50,00:12:00.50,suspicious. She literally gets up out of the
191,00:12:03.12,00:12:03.12,"bed, sits right next me. I'm, like, is she kidding me"
192,00:12:06.42,00:12:06.42,right now? >> Could you guys scoot over a
193,00:12:08.33,00:12:08.33,"little? >> Whatcha doing, Amanda?"
194,00:12:10.58,00:12:10.58,>> Nothing. Wow.
195,00:12:13.83,00:12:13.83,"Why am I getting, like... Amanda, I'll seriously grab it"
196,00:12:18.42,00:12:18.42,out of your hand. >> Will you just relax for a
197,00:12:20.75,00:12:20.75,"second? >> Hey, give it back to me!"
198,00:12:22.75,00:12:22.75,>> What are you doing? You're a psychopath!
199,00:12:24.38,00:12:24.38,">> It's not yours. >> Yes, it is!"
200,00:12:27.54,00:12:27.54,Amanda... >> I saw it there!
201,00:12:29.08,00:12:29.08,>> Give it to me! You're kidding me-- I found it!
202,00:12:31.50,00:12:31.50,">> Oh, my God! >> Give me back the clue."
203,00:12:34.54,00:12:34.54,"Can you give it back to me, please?"
204,00:12:36.46,00:12:36.46,>> No. >> Are you serious?
205,00:12:38.62,00:12:38.62,>> It's not yours-- it was in the room.
206,00:12:40.54,00:12:40.54,">> I found it. You're psychotic for, like,"
207,00:12:43.04,00:12:43.04,doing what you just did. You're really psychotic.
208,00:12:45.75,00:12:45.75,"Colby, are you serious, what she just did?"
209,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17,>> I didn't even see what happened.
210,00:12:49.83,00:12:49.83,"I was watching Treasure Island. >> We... we have a problem,"
211,00:12:53.62,00:12:53.62,obviously. >> What's our... what's our
212,00:12:56.12,00:12:56.12,resolution? >> Can you tell her to give it
213,00:12:58.12,00:12:58.12,back to me so I can have it in my hand 'cause I found it?
214,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,"And this is ridiculous. >> I mean, this is our life in"
215,00:13:04.46,00:13:04.46,the game; it's not ridiculous to me.
216,00:13:06.25,00:13:06.25,>> It's ridiculous that you grabbed it the way you did.
217,00:13:08.79,00:13:08.79,>> It was out of... (all talking)
218,00:13:11.12,00:13:11.12,"...it was out of desperation. >> I'm, like, shaking right now."
219,00:13:13.79,00:13:13.79,">> It's your clue, Danielle, it's your clue-- you found it."
220,00:13:16.50,00:13:16.50,">> Yes, but I would like it back in my hand."
221,00:13:19.17,00:13:19.17,>> Give it... It's okay. >> I need a glass of wine.
222,00:13:22.92,00:13:22.92,">> Yeah, so in the end, I ended up giving the clue back and gave"
223,00:13:25.79,00:13:25.79,"it to Danielle, like an idiot. And then Colby wasn't backing"
224,00:13:29.58,00:13:29.58,"me up, and I was just, like, ""Oh, my God."""
225,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,"I was just, like, ""Are you kidding me?"""
226,00:13:35.58,00:13:35.58,Oh! (squawking)
227,00:13:45.96,00:13:45.96,(indistinct talking) >> SEVERAL: Hey!
228,00:13:51.08,00:13:51.08,>> Look at you guys! >> Welcome back!
229,00:13:53.42,00:13:53.42,">> Hey, guys. >> And if me and Russell and"
230,00:13:59.21,00:13:59.21,Rupert had won that... >> It would've been really
231,00:14:01.25,00:14:01.25,"funny. >> Like, the three of us barely"
232,00:14:03.04,00:14:03.04,fit in. >> That's awesome.
233,00:14:05.46,00:14:05.46,(Russell speaks indistinctly) >> (whispers): Amanda grabs it
234,00:14:30.50,00:14:30.50,"from underneath me and runs over to the other side of the room,"
235,00:14:34.04,00:14:34.04,"so I jump up, I grab her and I hold her arm, and I was, like,"
236,00:14:37.21,00:14:37.21,"""Give me that ... thing back!"" And I wrestled her to the ground"
237,00:14:40.08,00:14:40.08,"and ripped it out of her hand. >> (laughs): Oh, my God!"
238,00:14:47.08,00:14:47.08,">> ""Follow the path to where you get water for drinking."""
239,00:14:50.58,00:14:50.58,>> It says on the clue something about a stream where they
240,00:14:53.21,00:14:53.21,drink water. It's by the stream over here
241,00:14:55.08,00:14:55.08,"under a rock, by a bendy tree. Danielle's looking at one side,"
242,00:15:02.33,00:15:02.33,I'm looking at the other side. I pick up a rock after being
243,00:15:05.08,00:15:05.08,there five seconds-- there it is.
244,00:15:08.42,00:15:08.42,"She turns her back to me. I take it out, throw it to the"
245,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,side. I sit on it.
246,00:15:17.29,00:15:17.29,I-I hid it in my pocket. I wanted to break away from her
247,00:15:23.83,00:15:23.83,immediately. Because they hid... they hid an
248,00:15:26.12,00:15:26.12,immunity idol from me. They didn't let me know about
249,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,it. You know what?
250,00:15:30.21,00:15:30.21,I'm not letting them know about it.
251,00:15:32.46,00:15:32.46,I am the king of hidden immunity idols.
252,00:15:36.92,00:15:36.92,(thunder rumbling) >> It's still raining.
253,00:15:46.08,00:15:46.08,>> Barely. (thunder crashing)
254,00:15:58.88,00:15:58.88,This is my guarantee to you that I'm serious and this isn't...
255,00:16:04.08,00:16:04.08,I have the idol. >> How'd you get it?
256,00:16:07.21,00:16:07.21,">> Because she gave me the clue, and I found it before she even"
257,00:16:10.33,00:16:10.33,got there. >> Nice!
258,00:16:13.21,00:16:13.21,">> With me showing you the idol, it should show you that I trust"
259,00:16:16.58,00:16:16.58,you 100%. >> Will you show it to me now?
260,00:16:22.04,00:16:22.04,>> You want to see it now? >> I'd rather see it now.
261,00:16:25.12,00:16:25.12,">> Okay, let's go see it, then. >> All right."
262,00:16:34.12,00:16:34.12,>> Stick with me. I could take you places.
263,00:16:37.75,00:16:37.75,>> Knowing that Russell has the idol could be a little bit of
264,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,"ammunition for me, but right now I can't tell anybody, because I"
265,00:16:44.50,00:16:44.50,can't trust anybody to not take a little bit of information that
266,00:16:48.58,00:16:48.58,they get and use it against me. >> But now you trust me.
267,00:16:51.79,00:16:51.79,>> I trust you. >> We are going to the final
268,00:16:54.08,00:16:54.08,three. This is what's gonna get us
269,00:16:56.00,00:16:56.00,there. >> I'm  not sure that I trust
270,00:16:57.75,00:16:57.75,"Russell a hundred percent, but it's a big thing that he showed"
271,00:17:01.25,00:17:01.25,"me the hidden immunity idol. So it's just, it's really tough."
272,00:17:04.83,00:17:04.83,It was a tough decision to make. >> This is real.
273,00:17:07.75,00:17:07.75,>> All right. >> Tyson was first-- he was in
274,00:17:33.25,00:17:33.25,my alliance. Then they took out Boston Rob--
275,00:17:35.25,00:17:35.25,he was in my alliance. They took out Courtney before we
276,00:17:38.17,00:17:38.17,came here because they knew that if me and Courtney came over
277,00:17:41.38,00:17:41.38,"here, they were done. >> Okay."
278,00:17:44.21,00:17:44.21,">> So if I flip with you guys and make it five against four,"
279,00:17:48.12,00:17:48.12,"it's either got to be Danielle, Parvati or Russell."
280,00:17:51.58,00:17:51.58,When Tyson went and then Boston Rob went and then Courtney left
281,00:17:54.96,00:17:54.96,"me, I was, like, I'm done. But now that they took out J.T."
282,00:17:59.58,00:17:59.58,"and now I can jump to them and be five against four, now is the"
283,00:18:03.46,00:18:03.46,perfect time for me to make my move.
284,00:18:06.00,00:18:06.00,">> In terms of the idol, I agree with you-- Danielle has"
285,00:18:08.71,00:18:08.71,it. >> And she's greedy.
286,00:18:10.21,00:18:10.21,>> I also agree she's not gonna give it away.
287,00:18:12.04,00:18:12.04,"I know Danielle has the hidden immunity idol, or will, because"
288,00:18:14.79,00:18:14.79,she has the clue. So we have to assume she's gonna
289,00:18:18.17,00:18:18.17,find it and she'll have it in her possession.
290,00:18:21.17,00:18:21.17,But if Danielle doesn't win immunity today-- which I'm gonna
291,00:18:24.54,00:18:24.54,try my damndest to keep her from it-- don't you think she'll play
292,00:18:28.25,00:18:28.25,the idol tonight? >> She don't think she's in
293,00:18:30.71,00:18:30.71,"bad shape. They won't tell me till, like,"
294,00:18:33.12,00:18:33.12,"an hour before who it is, because they don't tell me"
295,00:18:35.42,00:18:35.42,nothing. >> So we need to make sure they
296,00:18:37.83,00:18:37.83,"don't think you're flipping. So the thing is, we need you."
297,00:18:41.71,00:18:41.71,"We need you, and if you want to do this, do we first take out"
298,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,Russell or Parvati? Tonight.
299,00:18:55.38,00:18:55.38,">> What, did Colby try to talk to you any?"
300,00:18:58.12,00:18:58.12,">> No. He-he's kind of, like, uptight."
301,00:19:02.00,00:19:02.00,"Like Jerri said, he, like, doesn't have no personality."
302,00:19:04.29,00:19:04.29,>> Yeah. >> I know I told you I haven't
303,00:19:06.46,00:19:06.46,talked to him since the day we got here-- that's why he's dying
304,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,to talk to me. >> We have five votes right now.
305,00:19:11.38,00:19:11.38,>> Mm-hmm. >> We have six votes.
306,00:19:13.38,00:19:13.38,">> Oh. >> Like, if you would flip, and"
307,00:19:15.50,00:19:15.50,all of a sudden we get five votes and you vote another
308,00:19:17.96,00:19:17.96,way... that would be... >> It wouldn't matter.
309,00:19:21.38,00:19:21.38,>> ...bad for the game. >> No. No. Hold up.
310,00:19:24.29,00:19:24.29,"You're doing math wrong. >> No... no, I'm saying we have"
311,00:19:27.04,00:19:27.04,six people. We have one person from their
312,00:19:28.88,00:19:28.88,"tribe voting with us today. >> Oh, okay."
313,00:19:34.12,00:19:34.12,">> But anyway, I trust you. (Sandra laughs)"
314,00:19:38.12,00:19:38.12,">> If I stay with the Villains, I'm top five, I'm not moving up"
315,00:19:41.33,00:19:41.33,from there-- because they're not willing to get rid of Russell.
316,00:19:45.04,00:19:45.04,That's why I have to flip to the Heroes-- because I need to get
317,00:19:50.12,00:19:50.12,Russell out. Russell? You want Russell gone?
318,00:19:52.46,00:19:52.46,>> Yeah. >> Russell's gone. He's gone.
319,00:19:54.25,00:19:54.25,">> All four of us are going, all four of us will vote for..."
320,00:19:57.00,00:19:57.00,">> Yeah, but Russell just told me now, somebody from them"
321,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,already came to us again. I'm hoping that one of those
322,00:20:01.62,00:20:01.62,"girls is lying, and that they're gonna stick with you."
323,00:20:03.62,00:20:03.62,They need to stick with you or this won't work.
324,00:20:06.83,00:20:06.83,"If they don't stick with you, they're going home one after the"
325,00:20:08.92,00:20:08.92,other. So it's up to you.
326,00:20:10.96,00:20:10.96,>> I'd rather... Which do you want?
327,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,I'd rather put Russell's ass out there.
328,00:20:14.79,00:20:14.79,"My gosh, alls it will take is Sandra to switch over to our"
329,00:20:18.21,00:20:18.21,"side, there's five votes for Russell, we could get Russell"
330,00:20:22.92,00:20:22.92,out of this game! The guy is a piece of garbage.
331,00:20:28.12,00:20:28.12,>> Sandra's the one that came to me.
332,00:20:30.12,00:20:30.12,"And then this morning, she just spilled the beans of why she's"
333,00:20:32.83,00:20:32.83,"so sick of all of them, including Russell."
334,00:20:35.00,00:20:35.00,Really wants to get rid of Russell. Um...
335,00:20:37.46,00:20:37.46,>> So we vote tonight for whoever she wants?
336,00:20:40.04,00:20:40.04,">> Yeah. I mean, this is it. So... I don't see any reason why"
337,00:20:44.79,00:20:44.79,Sandra would bluff me at this point.
338,00:20:47.04,00:20:47.04,If Sandra's telling me the truth.
339,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,"Who knows, she could be playing me for the Villains."
340,00:20:51.33,00:20:51.33,"But if she's telling me the truth, you know, she's ready to"
341,00:20:53.71,00:20:53.71,come on board and play ball with us.
342,00:20:56.25,00:20:56.25,"So this changes everything, in a hurry."
343,00:20:58.58,00:20:58.58,"So what we've got to do is go into immunity, try to win to"
344,00:21:02.12,00:21:02.12,prevent the Villain from getting it.
345,00:21:04.17,00:21:04.17,"But if we don't, we hope that Sandra's telling us the truth,"
346,00:21:07.25,00:21:07.25,"we hope she's gonna vote with us, and in that case, we will"
347,00:21:09.71,00:21:09.71,either vote out Russell or Parvati tonight.
348,00:21:20.00,00:21:20.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's"
349,00:21:29.21,00:21:29.21,"immunity challenge? >> Yes, sir."
350,00:21:31.04,00:21:31.04,>> PROBST: First things first. Danielle.
351,00:21:37.17,00:21:37.17,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
352,00:21:41.04,00:21:41.04,"For today's challenge, you will each have a 150 wooden tiles."
353,00:21:45.96,00:21:45.96,"On my go, you will use those tiles to build a house of cards"
354,00:21:50.21,00:21:50.21,ten feet tall. First person to finish wins
355,00:21:54.54,00:21:54.54,"immunity, is guaranteed a one-in-eight shot at winning"
356,00:21:58.12,00:21:58.12,"this game. Losers go to Tribal Council,"
357,00:22:00.12,00:22:00.12,where somebody will be voted out.
358,00:22:02.33,00:22:02.33,"We'll draw for spots, we'll get started."
359,00:22:10.00,00:22:10.00,"All right, here we go. For immunity."
360,00:22:14.04,00:22:14.04,Survivors ready? Go.
361,00:22:20.21,00:22:20.21,First person to get to ten feet wins immunity.
362,00:22:25.96,00:22:25.96,"Very quickly, there are lots of different strategies about how"
363,00:22:29.04,00:22:29.04,to build this. It's going to take some
364,00:22:32.04,00:22:32.04,experimenting. You may crash and burn a few
365,00:22:35.62,00:22:35.62,times. Don't panic if yours crumbles.
366,00:22:41.12,00:22:41.12,Don't panic if you see the person next to you doing better.
367,00:23:09.83,00:23:09.83,Jerri doing a very nice job. Russell's doing a nice job.
368,00:23:16.17,00:23:16.17,Building a nice base. Danielle staying in it.
369,00:23:20.83,00:23:20.83,Colby's building a nice house of cards.
370,00:23:24.17,00:23:24.17,And it all comes tumbling down. Jerri just at about six feet.
371,00:23:30.50,00:23:30.50,Russell at five feet. Danielle at four feet.
372,00:23:36.08,00:23:36.08,Amanda still on her first level. Sandra's collapses.
373,00:23:44.96,00:23:44.96,Sandra now starting over. Jerri now getting close to the
374,00:23:48.62,00:23:48.62,eight-foot mark. >> Oh.
375,00:23:54.08,00:23:54.08,>> PROBST: It's Russell and Jerri both just under eight
376,00:23:57.21,00:23:57.21,feet. This is when you have to be very
377,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,careful. Jerri with a few seconds' lead
378,00:24:20.38,00:24:20.38,right now. Russell's going to have to pick
379,00:24:23.75,00:24:23.75,it up. Jerri at the nine-foot mark.
380,00:24:27.12,00:24:27.12,This will put her at nine and a half feet.
381,00:24:30.08,00:24:30.08,Russell at the nine-foot mark. This will put him at nine and a
382,00:24:33.21,00:24:33.21,half feet. Nobody else is even close at
383,00:24:36.88,00:24:36.88,this point. This is neck and neck.
384,00:24:44.62,00:24:44.62,Russell is out of cards. Trying to make a little pyramid
385,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,to get him at ten feet. Russell's not there.
386,00:24:51.12,00:24:51.12,Russell's going to have to hustle.
387,00:24:55.12,00:24:55.12,Jerri on her last stack. Jerri wins immunity!
388,00:25:09.38,00:25:09.38,(Jerri whoops) By seconds over Russell.
389,00:25:13.96,00:25:13.96,>> Yay! (Jerri whoops)
390,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,Okay. (Jerri laughs)
391,00:25:20.54,00:25:20.54,">> PROBST: Come on over, Jerri. >> Yay!"
392,00:25:22.58,00:25:22.58,(laughter) My very first immunity.
393,00:25:25.17,00:25:25.17,>> PROBST: Ever? >> Ever!
394,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,>> PROBST: Congratulations. >> Yay!
395,00:25:29.17,00:25:29.17,">> PROBST: Came at a good time, right?"
396,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,">> It did. >> PROBST: With this, Jerri is"
397,00:25:33.58,00:25:33.58,"safe at tonight's Tribal Council, guaranteed a"
398,00:25:36.12,00:25:36.12,one-in-eight shot at winning this game.
399,00:25:40.42,00:25:40.42,"For the rest of you, after 30 days in this game, one of you"
400,00:25:43.67,00:25:43.67,going home tonight. Grab your stuff.
401,00:25:45.67,00:25:45.67,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
402,00:25:48.21,00:25:48.21,Congratulations. >> Thank you.
403,00:25:52.04,00:25:52.04,>> I'm voting for Russell because I've been waiting to
404,00:25:55.50,00:25:55.50,take him down for 30 days. 30 days too long.
405,00:25:58.88,00:25:58.88,"It's time for revenge, and this is for Courtney, Boston Rob,"
406,00:26:02.62,00:26:02.62,"Tyson, and even Coach, who I don't care about, but I'll stick"
407,00:26:07.08,00:26:07.08,"him in there, too. (bird squawking)"
408,00:26:21.50,00:26:21.50,>> I'm having an amazing day. This is the first time I've ever
409,00:26:26.17,00:26:26.17,"had immunity, so I'm just trying to appreciate and really live in"
410,00:26:29.42,00:26:29.42,"the extreme high I'm experiencing right now, 'cause"
411,00:26:31.67,00:26:31.67,it feels good. (Jerri laughs)
412,00:26:33.67,00:26:33.67,I'm swimming in yay. (laughs)
413,00:26:41.21,00:26:41.21,">> That's good. You go, girl!"
414,00:26:44.92,00:26:44.92,>> My very first immunity! >> I'm fine with Jerri winning.
415,00:26:50.04,00:26:50.04,"Any one of my teammates could have won it, and I'm fine with"
416,00:26:52.88,00:26:52.88,"that. I mean, look at the other side."
417,00:26:55.21,00:26:55.21,Rupert and Colby? They're done.
418,00:26:58.04,00:26:58.04,They look done. And Candice thinks I'm going to
419,00:27:01.08,00:27:01.08,take her to the top three. I haven't really made the
420,00:27:03.67,00:27:03.67,decision yet. So Amanda is really an
421,00:27:06.42,00:27:06.42,"aggressive, strategic player. She's kind of like Boston Rob"
422,00:27:09.75,00:27:09.75,"in a girl's body, so she has to go."
423,00:27:15.04,00:27:15.04,Let's put her name down tonight. We really ain't got to discuss
424,00:27:18.17,00:27:18.17,"much. >> Yeah, I know."
425,00:27:20.17,00:27:20.17,"I know she's working it, you know?"
426,00:27:22.96,00:27:22.96,">> Put her name down tonight. I guarantee you, she'll have six"
427,00:27:25.04,00:27:25.04,"votes anyway, but I just want to make sure that everything's cool"
428,00:27:29.92,00:27:29.92,"with me and you, with you putting her name down."
429,00:27:32.08,00:27:32.08,"I trust you. I just, you know, I'm playing"
430,00:27:34.46,00:27:34.46,"the game like you. > Listen, I'm-I'm ready to put"
431,00:27:38.75,00:27:38.75,her name down. She has crossed me too many
432,00:27:41.25,00:27:41.25,"times... Going into Tribal, I knew that"
433,00:27:43.33,00:27:43.33,either way that I chose could be really the beginning of the
434,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,"end for me, because I was going to make people really mad on"
435,00:27:52.25,00:27:52.25,"either side, and, uh, you know, just the fact that Russell had"
436,00:27:57.08,00:27:57.08,the immunity idol and could pass it to anyone made me nervous
437,00:28:00.04,00:28:00.04,about not voting with the Villains.
438,00:28:02.75,00:28:02.75,"And, uh, so, I felt like I had to go with the plan that was"
439,00:28:06.54,00:28:06.54,the most solid. >> I know I got to pack.
440,00:28:09.88,00:28:09.88,I never went to Tribal Council and not taken...
441,00:28:12.17,00:28:12.17,">> Yeah. Me, neither. Me, neither."
442,00:28:14.17,00:28:14.17,>> Since Pearl Islands when I walked in there thinking I was
443,00:28:16.62,00:28:16.62,safe and went home with nothing. >> Oh!
444,00:28:19.88,00:28:19.88,">> Nothing. >> Oh, yeah."
445,00:28:21.88,00:28:21.88,>> The one time I thought I was safe-- that's the day I went
446,00:28:25.00,00:28:25.00,home. >> Yeah.
447,00:28:27.00,00:28:27.00,>> We got lucky because Russell's going home tonight.
448,00:28:45.04,00:28:45.04,Done. >> Take my turn?
449,00:28:47.50,00:28:47.50,>> Yup. >> Hmm?
450,00:29:00.50,00:29:00.50,>> Um... >> Acting like she's crying...
451,00:29:42.54,00:29:42.54,>> Sandra. (Sandra mumbles)
452,00:29:44.54,00:29:44.54,No. I want to talk to you. Sit down.
453,00:29:47.08,00:29:47.08,Before Candice gets up there. I don't know why she's running
454,00:29:49.50,00:29:49.50,"up here, but, uh, she said that you said... you know, putting my"
455,00:29:53.79,00:29:53.79,name right now. You're saying you're going to
456,00:29:55.83,00:29:55.83,"vote for me. >> No, nobody's going to vote"
457,00:29:57.88,00:29:57.88,for you. >> That's what she said was
458,00:29:59.96,00:29:59.96,said. >> Amanda's going home.
459,00:30:02.96,00:30:02.96,>> An idol's getting played tonight.
460,00:30:04.96,00:30:04.96,">> I'm not scared, Russell. >> Nah..."
461,00:30:06.96,00:30:06.96,>> Why are you trying to threaten me?
462,00:30:09.00,00:30:09.00,>> I ain't threatening you. I'm just saying... I just...
463,00:30:11.17,00:30:11.17,I-I... I believe that Candice believes that this is her only
464,00:30:14.04,00:30:14.04,"option, and, uh, Sandra, the same thing, and because of that,"
465,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,they have to make the decision to get Amanda out of here.
466,00:30:20.75,00:30:20.75,>> Right. Then it does... >> If you put Amanda's name
467,00:30:23.12,00:30:23.12,"tonight, she goes home, period. >> Yeah, I am."
468,00:30:25.33,00:30:25.33,>> If you put Amanda's name down.
469,00:30:27.38,00:30:27.38,"Either one of you all switch, then it don't matter."
470,00:30:29.67,00:30:29.67,"If you put it, she goes home. If you put it, she goes home."
471,00:30:32.00,00:30:32.00,She goes home. >> But she is going home.
472,00:30:34.00,00:30:34.00,>> Right. >> If Candice and Sandra flips
473,00:30:36.00,00:30:36.00,"on me today, then I go home. They both would have to have"
474,00:30:38.58,00:30:38.58,some kind of genius plan to flip on me tonight to go to the
475,00:30:42.17,00:30:42.17,Heroes? The beat-up Heroes?
476,00:30:45.00,00:30:45.00,"If they do that, then more power to 'em."
477,00:31:04.58,00:31:04.58,>> Uh-uh. >> Candice went and told Russell
478,00:31:10.12,00:31:10.12,"every single thing that was said, including that I was on"
479,00:31:13.29,00:31:13.29,"board with Rupert, Amanda and the rest of them, and now we're"
480,00:31:16.08,00:31:16.08,"screwed, and now they won't trust us anymore after this."
481,00:31:26.08,00:31:26.08,>> Why are you switching now? >> She's not.
482,00:31:28.12,00:31:28.12,>> I'm not switching. >> Listen...
483,00:31:30.12,00:31:30.12,">> You're-You're with us? >> Yes, she's totally with us."
484,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,">> Oh, my God. We are trying like heck to keep"
485,00:31:38.79,00:31:38.79,everybody calm. >> So we just have to figure
486,00:31:43.04,00:31:43.04,out... >> I'm not hanging you out to
487,00:31:47.38,00:31:47.38,"dry. >> Listen, we're okay."
488,00:31:49.38,00:31:49.38,"Sandra, you're good. Candice is on our side."
489,00:31:51.96,00:31:51.96,We're voting for Parvati. >> We're not going to let you
490,00:31:54.25,00:31:54.25,hang out to dry. None of us will.
491,00:31:56.25,00:31:56.25,>> We're not going to let you hang out to dry.
492,00:31:58.25,00:31:58.25,"We're voting Parvati. Now, who's going to tell Amanda?"
493,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,>> I'll tell Amanda. (Sandra mumbles)
494,00:32:03.17,00:32:03.17,>> We think Russell got wind of our plan and has convinced
495,00:32:06.96,00:32:06.96,"Danielle to give the idol to him, but the greed inside of her"
496,00:32:10.29,00:32:10.29,is going to make her not want to give it away.
497,00:32:13.17,00:32:13.17,"If we vote all for Danielle, they've still won."
498,00:32:15.29,00:32:15.29,"If we vote for Russell, and Danielle goes to give it away,"
499,00:32:18.04,00:32:18.04,they've still won. So maybe we throw Parvati in
500,00:32:20.25,00:32:20.25,"and just vote for her, 'cause nobody's gotten her on the"
501,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,radar. >> So if this thing doesn't
502,00:32:24.29,00:32:24.29,"work out... >> What do you mean, am I gonna"
503,00:32:27.62,00:32:27.62,help you? What do you want me to go to do?
504,00:32:29.62,00:32:29.62,>> Are we going to do this? >> Yes.
505,00:32:31.62,00:32:31.62,">> Okay, so... >> Yeah, if this thing doesn't"
506,00:32:33.62,00:32:33.62,"work, it's Candice's fault. True or no?"
507,00:32:35.62,00:32:35.62,">> No. >> No, really. I mean, really."
508,00:32:37.62,00:32:37.62,"If this doesn't work, then Candice is the one who spilled"
509,00:32:39.62,00:32:39.62,the beans. >> You got five...
510,00:32:41.08,00:32:41.08,It's insanely crazy right now. There's three days of scrambling
511,00:32:43.25,00:32:43.25,going on in three minutes. >> We need to do this.
512,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,"We need to vote out Parvati, and we'll be right on track."
513,00:32:54.88,00:32:54.88,"If you're scared of Russell, we'll write his name down."
514,00:32:56.96,00:32:56.96,"I promise you. I bet you 100%, Danielle will"
515,00:32:59.04,00:32:59.04,not give him the idol. The fact that me and you are now
516,00:33:03.12,00:33:03.12,"talking like this, we're done already."
517,00:33:05.08,00:33:05.08,"We're freaking done. Russell, can we just have a"
518,00:33:07.83,00:33:07.83,"minute, please? It's like every time I try to"
519,00:33:09.83,00:33:09.83,"do something, somebody is in my face."
520,00:33:12.79,00:33:12.79,I can't even do nothing. It's crazy.
521,00:33:15.88,00:33:15.88,">> The only way we can fix this is to do what they said, because"
522,00:33:19.71,00:33:19.71,they think you're just jumping ship.
523,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,">> You're scared. And I am jumping ship, and I'm"
524,00:33:24.08,00:33:24.08,doing it for you. I did this for you.
525,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,I jumped ship for you. Why do you tell Russell
526,00:33:28.67,00:33:28.67,everything we talked about? Why did you run to him?
527,00:33:31.17,00:33:31.17,">> I didn't run to him. >> Oh, my God. We're done."
528,00:33:35.04,00:33:35.04,"Know what, they're going to bury us."
529,00:33:36.71,00:33:36.71,We can get rid of Amanda later. If we don't take care of one of
530,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,"them now... >> But they have the idol, and"
531,00:33:41.50,00:33:41.50,we don't know who it's... who is gonna...
532,00:33:43.12,00:33:43.12,">> You're going to do this for real, after I put my neck"
533,00:33:45.29,00:33:45.29,on the line for you guys all day today?
534,00:33:47.33,00:33:47.33,>> Sandra. Sandra. >> And now everything that we
535,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,worked for is about to go down the tubes?
536,00:33:52.67,00:33:52.67,">> Well, then, I mean... >> Tell me who you want out,"
537,00:33:55.50,00:33:55.50,please. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
538,00:34:13.46,00:34:13.46,>> PROBST: Now bring in the members of our jury.
539,00:34:18.33,00:34:18.33,"Coach... Courtney... and J.T., voted out at the last"
540,00:34:22.54,00:34:22.54,"Tribal Council. So, Rupert, after the last"
541,00:34:29.04,00:34:29.04,"Tribal Council, the Villains had the number advantage."
542,00:34:32.25,00:34:32.25,"So, when you're looking at the Villains, how do you figure out"
543,00:34:35.08,00:34:35.08,who might be vulnerable? Who might be the one that would
544,00:34:38.33,00:34:38.33,want to flip to improve their lot?
545,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,>> We've been talking about that for a while.
546,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,"But for one of the Villains to jump ship right now, they're"
547,00:34:46.08,00:34:46.08,still going to feel like they're fifth.
548,00:34:48.38,00:34:48.38,So there is no real need for any of the Villains to do
549,00:34:51.50,00:34:51.50,anything but stay with their five.
550,00:34:55.29,00:34:55.29,">> PROBST: Sandra, even Rupert, a Hero, says it's a crazy idea."
551,00:34:59.46,00:34:59.46,>> It's true. The best bet is just to stay
552,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,"with those who you're with, you know?"
553,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"But some of the Heroes have talked to me, and I know that"
554,00:35:07.12,00:35:07.12,"they sense that I'm on the outside, because even I know"
555,00:35:10.29,00:35:10.29,that I'm on the outside within my own group.
556,00:35:12.96,00:35:12.96,">> PROBST: So, Amanda, how do you make it appealing to"
557,00:35:15.46,00:35:15.46,"somebody like Sandra, who would say, ""I'm already fifth with the"
558,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,"group I got here with from the beginning""?"
559,00:35:20.08,00:35:20.08,">> Well, you offer them a better deal."
560,00:35:22.04,00:35:22.04,>> How do you know the deal that she's got going on now isn't
561,00:35:25.04,00:35:25.04,the best deal? >> She might have the best deal.
562,00:35:27.67,00:35:27.67,She's weak in challenges. She's easy to beat for the vote.
563,00:35:31.71,00:35:31.71,Sounds like somebody I want to take with me to the jury.
564,00:35:34.38,00:35:34.38,>> But there are so many times when I feel like I'm not wanted.
565,00:35:37.71,00:35:37.71,"You know what I'm saying? So I have, like, a sense of"
566,00:35:39.96,00:35:39.96,frustration within my own alliance.
567,00:35:42.33,00:35:42.33,">> PROBST: So, Russell, clearly, it ain't paradise in the"
568,00:35:45.54,00:35:45.54,"Villain tribe. >> First of all, the whole team,"
569,00:35:48.38,00:35:48.38,we play completely different. Danielle plays her way.
570,00:35:51.67,00:35:51.67,"She's real aggressive. You know, that's how she plays."
571,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,"I'm aggressive, too. And Jerri, she plays a"
572,00:35:57.96,00:35:57.96,different way. She's the calm one of the whole
573,00:36:00.50,00:36:00.50,"bunch. Parvati, she's, you know, the"
574,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,charming one of the whole bunch. She plays a different way.
575,00:36:07.17,00:36:07.17,>> What about me? You didn't include me.
576,00:36:10.04,00:36:10.04,">> Sandra, she's just there with us."
577,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,>> PROBST: That's a big statement.
578,00:36:14.96,00:36:14.96,">> See? I'm just there. >> PROBST: So, Rupert, there are"
579,00:36:18.88,00:36:18.88,cracks in that fivesome. >> I wish I would have known
580,00:36:22.21,00:36:22.21,there was distrust before right now sitting here at Tribal
581,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,"Council. >> PROBST: Russell, is one of"
582,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,the reasons you like how Danielle plays is that the more
583,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,"she plays, the less chance she has of winning?"
584,00:36:35.38,00:36:35.38,">> Yeah, I'll tell you what, she's fighting to get further in"
585,00:36:38.00,00:36:38.00,the game. If she gets further in the
586,00:36:39.75,00:36:39.75,"game, I get further in the game. That's why I was glad she did"
587,00:36:42.88,00:36:42.88,"go to the reward, because there's going to be another"
588,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,"clue for the hidden immunity idol, and she got it."
589,00:36:49.04,00:36:49.04,And she had to be very aggressive to get it.
590,00:36:51.54,00:36:51.54,">> PROBST: Colby, so what's the sense about the hidden immunity"
591,00:36:55.75,00:36:55.75,idol? >> Danielle has it.
592,00:36:57.58,00:36:57.58,"Yeah, definitely. That's the consensus on the"
593,00:36:59.96,00:36:59.96,"Hero tribe. >> Oh, yes, Danielle's found it."
594,00:37:02.12,00:37:02.12,">> PROBST: Parvati, everybody thinking Danielle has the idol"
595,00:37:05.62,00:37:05.62,might take the heat off of Danielle.
596,00:37:08.17,00:37:08.17,"Now maybe you're vulnerable. >> Um, yeah, I definitely feel"
597,00:37:11.92,00:37:11.92,vulnerable. I'm just trusting my alliance
598,00:37:14.04,00:37:14.04,to stay with me. But if somebody flips and they
599,00:37:17.08,00:37:17.08,"try to make it interesting, then I have no protection."
600,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,Because I've given my protection away.
601,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,">> PROBST: Russell, if somebody from the Villains were to flip"
602,00:37:25.17,00:37:25.17,"to the Heroes, you've got to be a huge target."
603,00:37:29.04,00:37:29.04,">> You know, unless I find an idol, I'm gone."
604,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,But I take risk in the game. And if you get caught with your
605,00:37:37.04,00:37:37.04,"hand in the cookie jar, you go home."
606,00:37:39.21,00:37:39.21,"But I'm well aware of that, and I'll take the risk all day long"
607,00:37:43.42,00:37:43.42,"to get further in the game. >> PROBST: All right, Jerri, you"
608,00:37:50.04,00:37:50.04,have the immunity necklace-- I assume you're keeping that?
609,00:37:52.12,00:37:52.12,>> Absolutely. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for
610,00:37:54.08,00:37:54.08,Jerri. Everybody else is fair game.
611,00:37:56.54,00:37:56.54,"It is time to vote. Russell, you're up."
612,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,">> You're a very strategic player, but I believe I know"
613,00:38:08.46,00:38:08.46,"what's going on tonight, so I'll be using the idol to get"
614,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,"rid of you. And I found it, not Danielle."
615,00:38:25.46,00:38:25.46,">> I have to play my game, you have to play yours."
616,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
617,00:39:01.54,00:39:01.54,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
618,00:39:04.21,00:39:04.21,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
619,00:39:14.25,00:39:14.25,">> You know what, Jeff? For some reason, I think"
620,00:39:16.96,00:39:16.96,somebody has flipped. And to keep them all honest...
621,00:39:21.62,00:39:21.62,hope I'm doing the right thing and playing it for myself this
622,00:39:24.96,00:39:24.96,time. >> PROBST: The rules of Survivor
623,00:39:34.17,00:39:34.17,"state that if anybody plays a hidden immunity idol, then any"
624,00:39:36.71,00:39:36.71,votes cast against that person will not count and the person
625,00:39:39.92,00:39:39.92,with the next highest number of votes will be sent home.
626,00:39:42.54,00:39:42.54,I'll read the votes. First vote...
627,00:39:50.58,00:39:50.58,Amanda. Amanda.
628,00:39:57.00,00:39:57.00,Two votes Amanda. Parvati.
629,00:40:03.17,00:40:03.17,"Two votes Amanda, one vote Parvati."
630,00:40:10.79,00:40:10.79,"Parvati. We're tied-- two votes Amanda,"
631,00:40:13.38,00:40:13.38,two votes Parvati. Amanda.
632,00:40:18.83,00:40:18.83,"That's three votes Amanda, two votes Parvati."
633,00:40:24.25,00:40:24.25,"Amanda. That's four votes Amanda, two"
634,00:40:26.38,00:40:26.38,votes Parvati. Parvati.
635,00:40:32.12,00:40:32.12,"That's four votes Amanda, three votes Parvati."
636,00:40:38.83,00:40:38.83,12th person voted out and the fourth member of our jury...
637,00:40:41.88,00:40:41.88,Amanda. That's five. That's enough.
638,00:40:43.92,00:40:43.92,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Okay, Jeff, I know you've"
639,00:40:54.62,00:40:54.62,been waiting forever to do this... so just do it. (laughs)
640,00:40:59.58,00:40:59.58,">> PROBST: Amanda, the tribe has spoken."
641,00:41:13.79,00:41:13.79,">> PROBST: Well, in spite of the fact that another Hero was"
642,00:41:16.17,00:41:16.17,"voted out tonight, one thing is very clear from tonight's Tribal"
643,00:41:19.04,00:41:19.04,"Council-- the Villains are not one, big happy family."
644,00:41:22.92,00:41:22.92,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
645,00:41:24.67,00:41:24.67,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
646,00:41:39.83,00:41:39.83,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
647,00:41:46.21,00:41:46.21,Survivor... >> We're set up pretty good.
648,00:41:48.21,00:41:48.21,Five Villains. But we need to be strong.
649,00:41:50.00,00:41:50.00,>> PROBST: The powerful Villains alliance...
650,00:41:52.79,00:41:52.79,"comes apart at the seams. >> Don't yell me, Russell."
651,00:41:55.21,00:41:55.21,>> I can't believe you. >> If she tries to get rid of
652,00:41:57.38,00:41:57.38,"either of us, we can easily blindside her."
653,00:41:59.54,00:41:59.54,>> Do not change your vote tonight no matter what he says
654,00:42:01.62,00:42:01.62,"to you. >> Bad move, you're going to"
655,00:42:03.42,00:42:03.42,"be next. >> I made too many mistakes,"
656,00:42:09.67,00:42:09.67,"and when you make too many mistakes in Survivor, you get"
657,00:42:12.17,00:42:12.17,booted. I kind of messed myself up in
658,00:42:14.50,00:42:14.50,the reward when I gave the clue to Danielle.
659,00:42:16.79,00:42:16.79,I should have kept it. It would have been kept me in
660,00:42:19.00,00:42:19.00,the game. I think that was my biggest
661,00:42:20.62,00:42:20.62,mistake. I think the rest of the game is
662,00:42:22.75,00:42:22.75,"going to be absolutely crazy, and I'm kind of glad I'm not a"
663,00:42:26.62,00:42:26.62,"part of it, to be honest."
