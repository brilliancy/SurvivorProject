227,00:14:05.57,00:14:05.57,"GIVE US SOME KIND OF ADVANTAGE, SOME KIND OF MOMENTUM."

229,00:14:12.47,00:14:12.47,WHY? IF THEY'D WON THERE WOULD BE
230,00:14:14.10,00:14:14.10,SEVEN PEOPLE SITTING AT THE SAME MEAL AS THIS.
231,00:14:16.33,00:14:16.33,"FIVE PEOPLE, WE GOT A LOT MORE FOOD THIS WAY."
232,00:14:18.37,00:14:18.37,THIS WILL TIDE US OVER UNTIL TOMORROW.

234,00:14:21.87,00:14:21.87,>> IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT TO SEE ALL THAT FOOD ON THE TABLE.
235,00:14:24.33,00:14:24.33,BUT THE FACT THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE RICE IS -- IS PROBABLY
236,00:14:27.60,00:14:27.60,GOING TO WEAR ON US IN A COUPLE DAYS.
237,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,">> YOU GUYS, I'M GOING TO BRING YOU SOMETHING, I'M NOT SURE WHAT"
238,00:14:34.67,00:14:34.67,IT'S IN IT BUT IT MAY BE REALLY COOL.
239,00:14:37.43,00:14:37.43,>> IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WE REALIZED OUR TABLE OFF TO THE
240,00:14:40.23,00:14:40.23,SIDE WERE LITTLE ENVELOPES WITH OUR NAMES ON THEM.
241,00:14:43.83,00:14:43.83,"KATIE, DENICE -- >> I KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN THESE"
242,00:14:46.37,00:14:46.37,ENVELOPES AND IT WAS OUR LETTERS FROM HOME.

244,00:14:52.57,00:14:52.57,>> THE TRIBE STARTED READING THEIR LETTERS AND INSTANTLY
245,00:14:55.70,00:14:55.70,PEOPLE STARTED TEARING UP. WE'RE SO FAR FROM REALITY OUT
246,00:15:00.67,00:15:00.67,HERE THAT WHEN WE GET A GLIMPSE OF IT JUST HITS IN A PLACE THAT
247,00:15:05.13,00:15:05.13,WE'RE NOT USED TO. I JUST WANT TO GO HOME NOW.
248,00:15:14.30,00:15:14.30,I'VE GOT A PRETTY BIG FAMILY AT HOME.
249,00:15:16.57,00:15:16.57,HAVING A WIFE AND KIDS WRITE TO YOU AFTER SUFFERING THROUGH RAIN
250,00:15:18.90,00:15:18.90,"AND NO FOOD AND GETTING BANGED UP, THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT."
251,00:15:23.63,00:15:23.63,IT'S ALREADY 100 DEGREES IN TEXAS.
252,00:15:26.77,00:15:26.77,">> COMING TO THIS REWARD, IT'S MOTIVATIONAL FUEL, IT'S"
253,00:15:31.53,00:15:31.53,EMOTIONAL FUEL THAT MAKES ANY RICE WE GAVE UP TOTALLY WORTH IT
254,00:15:34.77,00:15:34.77,BECAUSE NOW THERE'S DIFFERENT MOTIVATION TO JUST KEEP GOING.
255,00:15:38.20,00:15:38.20,>> BETTER THAN FOOD. >> BETTER THAN FOOD.
256,00:15:39.60,00:15:39.60,THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MISSED.
257,00:15:41.40,00:15:41.40,>> WE CAME IN TERMED TO WIN AND I THINK THIS WAS A WIN.
258,00:15:44.70,00:15:44.70,WE WERE ABLE TO WALK AWAY WITH THIS VICTORY MEAL AND THESE
259,00:15:47.60,00:15:47.60,BEAUTIFUL LETTERS FROM HOME. WE'RE GOING TO BE STRONG GOING
260,00:15:50.17,00:15:50.17,INTO THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WHICH IS REALLY THE IMPORTANT
261,00:15:52.73,00:15:52.73,"CHALLENGE. >> SORRY, ARTIS."
262,00:16:10.43,00:16:10.43,I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A BIRTHDAY FEAST.
263,00:16:12.87,00:16:12.87,>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT FEELS BRUTAL THAT KALABAW IS
264,00:16:18.30,00:16:18.30,ENJOYING THE REWARD THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AND WE'RE BACK HERE
265,00:16:22.37,00:16:22.37,FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL. >> WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME IS WE
266,00:16:38.13,00:16:38.13,HAD A MEMBER OF OUR TRIBE MAKE A DECISION FOR OUR TRIBE WHO HAS
267,00:16:44.83,00:16:44.83,DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR OUR TRIBE.
268,00:16:48.33,00:16:48.33,"AND R.C., YAY, MIKE! YAY!"
269,00:16:52.27,00:16:52.27,"I WAS LIKE SHUT UP, IT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL."
270,00:16:58.57,00:16:58.57,">> HERE'S THE RICE YOU GUYS WANTED TO FORFEIT FOR, ENJOY."
271,00:17:01.93,00:17:01.93,>> HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE? >> BASICALLY HOW MUCH WE HAVE
272,00:17:04.07,00:17:04.07,RIGHT NOW. >> WE DOUBLED OUR RICE.
273,00:17:05.50,00:17:05.50,>> THEY DON'T HAVE ANY. >> THEY DON'T HAVE ANY.
274,00:17:07.77,00:17:07.77,>> IF THE SUN WOULD COME OUT WE COULD ACTUALLY COOK SOME OF THAT
275,00:17:11.40,00:17:11.40,RICE. >> WE'LL BE ABLE TO COOK
276,00:17:13.47,00:17:13.47,"TONIGHT. >> GOOD, THANK YOU."
277,00:17:15.87,00:17:15.87,"THAT FEELS GOOD. WHEN WE GOT BACK, IT WAS WORSE"
278,00:17:18.97,00:17:18.97,THAN A LOSS AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BECAUSE WITH A LOSS
279,00:17:21.63,00:17:21.63,YOU DON'T HAVE ALSO ALL THEIR RICE.
280,00:17:24.47,00:17:24.47,"BUT IT WAS A GIVING UP, A FORFEIT WHICH WAS LIKE A DOUBLE"
281,00:17:29.73,00:17:29.73,LOSS IF YOU CHOOSE TO FOCUS YOUR ENERGY THAT WAY.
282,00:17:33.67,00:17:33.67,>> I'M AFRAID THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE DUMBEST MOMENTS OF
283,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,"""SURVIVOR."" PEOPLE GO UNTIL THEY AT LEAST"
284,00:17:40.20,00:17:40.20,LOSE. JUST GIVING OUT A PRIZE LIKE
285,00:17:41.87,00:17:41.87,THAT? NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
286,00:17:43.33,00:17:43.33,>> I MEAN THEY DID GIVE US A LOT MORE THAN WE THINK.
287,00:17:46.33,00:17:46.33,>> AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. >> THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.
288,00:17:48.63,00:17:48.63,">> YEAH, THEY DO. THEY HAVE BEER, THEY HAVE --"

290,00:17:55.13,00:17:55.13,">> SANDWICHES, BROWNIES, SOUP. >> WE GAVE UP A REWARD."
291,00:17:58.90,00:17:58.90,WE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR IT. AND I DOUBT KALABAW WOULD GIVE
292,00:18:02.10,00:18:02.10,"US ALL OF THEIR RICE WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN ""B."""
293,00:18:05.70,00:18:05.70,"THEY HAVE A BOAT AND THEY HAVE A SPEAR, THEY CAN GO OUT THERE"
294,00:18:09.80,00:18:09.80,FISHING. THEY'RE NOT STUPID.
295,00:18:12.10,00:18:12.10,KALABAW TOTALLY USED PSYCHOLOGY AND IT WORKED.
296,00:18:13.87,00:18:13.87,SO WE HAVE ONE MORE DAY OUT OF RICE OUT OF THEIRS AND HOW MUCH
297,00:18:16.43,00:18:16.43,DO WE HAVE OUT OF OURS? >> ONE.
298,00:18:18.10,00:18:18.10,">> SO WE HAVE TWO DAYS LEFT. >> WELL, IF WE SEPARATE IT"
299,00:18:20.93,00:18:20.93,OTHERWISE THIS IS A BIG POT BECAUSE -->> SO BASICALLY WE
300,00:18:23.20,00:18:23.20,HAVE TWO MORE DAYS LEFT OF RICE. NOT A WEEK LIKE WE THOUGHT.
301,00:18:30.67,00:18:30.67,>> WE HAVE TO START EATING SMALLER.
302,00:18:32.27,00:18:32.27,>> THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HERE.
303,00:18:34.77,00:18:34.77,BUT EVERYBODY'S HUNGRY. FREAKING STUPID.

306,00:18:46.43,00:18:46.43,DO THINGS YOU DON'T NORMALLY DO. BUT THIS IS JUST NASTY.
307,00:18:48.73,00:18:48.73,>> ARTIS WAS CURSING UP A STORM THROUGH THE COMPETITION.
308,00:18:52.67,00:18:52.67,AND CURSING AT YOU. >> WHAT DID I DO?
309,00:18:54.77,00:18:54.77,>> NOTHING. I DON'T THINK YOU DID ANYTHING.
310,00:18:56.37,00:18:56.37,HE WAS JUST REALLY UPSET. SEEMS LIKE HE WANTED NO PART OF
311,00:19:00.10,00:19:00.10,IT. >> THEN WHY DID HE AGREE?
312,00:19:01.80,00:19:01.80,>> I DON'T KNOW. >> THERE WAS NO WINNING THAT
313,00:19:03.27,00:19:03.27,CHALLENGE. >> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

315,00:19:07.20,00:19:07.20,HE'LL WHISPER TO EVERYBODY ELSE BUT HE WON'T CONFRONT ME.
316,00:19:09.60,00:19:09.60,"BUT I DIDN'T MAKE THIS DECISION. >> NO, YOU ASKED EVERY SINGLE"

323,00:19:29.27,00:19:29.27,BUT THEY HAD THE UPPER HAND SO MY STRATEGY IS TO LET ABI-MARIA
324,00:19:32.43,00:19:32.43,BLOW UP CONSTANTLY-- (LAUGHS) -- AND ME JUST SLIDE UNDER THE
325,00:19:37.03,00:19:37.03,RADAR. BUT SHE'S LIKE THIS BRAZILIAN

464,00:29:28.40,00:29:28.40,WE SHOULD HAVE JUST JUMPED ON HIM.
465,00:29:30.53,00:29:30.53,WE WERE OVERMATCHED. >> AT TODAY'S IMMUNITY CHALLENGE
466,00:29:34.53,00:29:34.53,CARTER WAS DEFINITELY OUTMUSCLED AND OUTMANEUVERED BY MALCOLM AND
467,00:29:37.90,00:29:37.90,WE ENDED UP SHORT AGAIN SO ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT.
468,00:29:42.60,00:29:42.60,WE'VE GOT TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL AND VOTE SOMEBODY OFF
469,00:29:45.60,00:29:45.60,"AND PENNER AND I HAVE AN ALLIANCE, BUT I'M STILL ON THE"
470,00:29:49.33,00:29:49.33,FENCE RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY I'M GOING

475,00:30:10.90,00:30:10.90,SEE A TON OF EFFORT. IT'S LIKE -- IT'S JUST HARD FOR
476,00:30:13.83,00:30:13.83,ME TO WANT TO KEEP HER AROUND BECAUSE OF THAT.
477,00:30:16.33,00:30:16.33,>> KATIE'S WORTHLESS. SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE
478,00:30:19.27,00:30:19.27,CHALLENGES. SHE'S GOING TO SET US BACK.
479,00:30:21.63,00:30:21.63,WE'VE JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT IS IT BETTER FOR US TO GO WITH
480,00:30:24.63,00:30:24.63,PENNER IN THE MERGE OR NOT? BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT A VETERAN
481,00:30:28.00,00:30:28.00,TO WIN. >> ALTHOUGH I REALLY WANT KATIE
482,00:30:32.43,00:30:32.43,"GONE, I'LL VOTE FOR PENNER. >> I JUST WANT TO STICK WITH OUR"
483,00:30:37.20,00:30:37.20,ORIGINAL LOGICAL THOUGHT OUT PLAN OF STAYING TWO STEPS AHEAD.
484,00:30:41.03,00:30:41.03,>> WE'RE KICKING OURSELVES IN THE BUTT FOR THE REST OF OUR
485,00:30:44.27,00:30:44.27,LIVES IF WE GET BLINDSIDED BY HIM.
486,00:30:46.43,00:30:46.43,>> JEFF THINKS IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A BIG MOVE AND
487,00:30:49.47,00:30:49.47,"GET RID OF JONATHAN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW,"
488,00:30:52.80,00:30:52.80,I THINK GOING INTO A MERGE WITH PENNER MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA
489,00:30:57.27,00:30:57.27,"BECAUSE IF WE GO IN WITH HIM EYES ARE GOING TO BE ON HIM, NOT"
490,00:31:01.30,00:31:01.30,ON ME AND JEFF. BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS A RETURNING
491,00:31:04.93,00:31:04.93,PLAYER TO WIN. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD ON
492,00:31:08.27,00:31:08.27,"THIS ONE, DUDE, OKAY? >> I THINK WE NEED TO PULL THE"
493,00:31:12.20,00:31:12.20,PENNER PUNCH. WE JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE
494,00:31:16.00,00:31:16.00,DOESN'T KNOW IT'S COMING SO HE DOESN'T USE THE IDOL.
495,00:31:18.90,00:31:18.90,"THAT'S ALL. >> PENNER, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO"
496,00:31:32.17,00:31:32.17,DO? KATIE OR PENNER?
497,00:31:35.50,00:31:35.50,"I MEAN KATIE OR DENICE? >> WELL, I HATE TO LOSE KATIE."
498,00:31:43.73,00:31:43.73,BUT AT LEAST WITH DENICE WE HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING THE NEXT
499,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,ONE. >> YEAH.
500,00:31:47.33,00:31:47.33,>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? >> YEAH.
501,00:31:49.37,00:31:49.37,>> WITH KATIE I DON'T THINK WE DO.
502,00:31:52.40,00:31:52.40,>> TO WIN THIS GAME I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE BIG MOVES OUT OF
503,00:31:55.90,00:31:55.90,DESPERATION. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
504,00:31:56.63,00:31:56.63,IF YOU'RE DOWN NUMBERS YOUR BACK STARTS TO GET PUT AGAINST THE
505,00:32:00.93,00:32:00.93,WALL. SO KATIE'S GOT TO GO.
506,00:32:02.53,00:32:02.53,SHE'S NOT USE TO FEEL US. I NEED HER GONE.
507,00:32:05.07,00:32:05.07,"LOOK, I HATE TO BE DISLOYAL BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT MY GUT IS"
508,00:32:08.60,00:32:08.60,"TELLING ME. >> DENICE, ALL RIGHT?"
509,00:32:12.60,00:32:12.60,WE ALL AGREE. >> OKAY.
510,00:32:14.67,00:32:14.67,>> ALL RIGHT? YOU COOL WITH THAT?
511,00:32:16.63,00:32:16.63,">> YEAH. >> OKAY, LET'S FISH."
512,00:32:25.63,00:32:25.63,>> THAT WAS SOME SHADY (BLEEP). WHAT'S HE REALLY SAYING?
513,00:32:30.37,00:32:30.37,>> HE'S OUT THERE. HE'S WAY OUT THERE NOW.
514,00:32:32.63,00:32:32.63,>> WHEN I WENT OVER TO THE THREE GUYS RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT ME EVEN
515,00:32:36.80,00:32:36.80,"ASKING PENNER WAS LIKE ""IT'S DENICE, IT'S DENICE."""
516,00:32:39.90,00:32:39.90,AND RIGHT AWAY I'M THINKING HE'S FEEDING ME A BIG LINE OF B.S.
517,00:32:43.73,00:32:43.73,AND I'M NOT BUYING IT. >> I'M STICKING -- I'M --
518,00:32:51.23,00:32:51.23,>> I TRUST DENICE A HELL OF A LOT MORE THAN I TRUST -- HE'S A
519,00:32:55.33,00:32:55.33,WILD CARD! PENNER'S WRITING SOMEONE DOWN.
520,00:32:58.07,00:32:58.07,THAT PERSON COULD BE ME FOR ALL I KNOW BECAUSE I AM PHYSICALLY
521,00:33:00.40,00:33:00.40,NOT THE STRONGEST PLAYER IN THIS GAME.
522,00:33:02.30,00:33:02.30,SO I'VE GOT TO HANG ON TO WHATEVER IS WILLING TO KEEP ME
523,00:33:05.37,00:33:05.37,HERE. AND IF WE'VE BEEN TALKING SINCE
524,00:33:06.87,00:33:06.87,"DAY ONE, JEFF AND I, ABOUT GETTING RID OF PENNER SO AS LONG"

526,00:33:14.83,00:33:14.83,GET RID OF JONATHAN THEN IT'S GOING TO WORK OUT FOR ME AND
527,00:33:18.27,00:33:18.27,THAT'S GOING TO KEEP ME HERE AT LEAST THROUGH THE MERGE.
528,00:33:21.33,00:33:21.33,">> SO YOU'RE READY TO GET JONATHAN OUT OF HERE, HUH?"
529,00:33:25.20,00:33:25.20,">> I'M SO DOWN, JEFF. GET HIM THE (BLEEP) OUT OF HERE!"

533,00:33:46.60,00:33:46.60,AND IT COMES DOWN YOU AND ME. STRAIGHT UP.
534,00:33:50.50,00:33:50.50,I'VE COME INTO THIS GAME KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LIE
535,00:33:53.23,00:33:53.23,AND KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO JEOPARDIZE MY INTEGRITY AND
536,00:33:57.30,00:33:57.30,CHARACTER SO I'M STILL WEIGHING MY OPTIONS AND ALL OF THEM HAVE
537,00:34:00.87,00:34:00.87,TO DO WITH FURTHERING MYSELF IN THIS GAME.
538,00:34:08.90,00:34:08.90,I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET SCREWED BY HIM.

543,00:34:26.30,00:34:26.30,I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.
544,00:34:30.17,00:34:30.17,>> WHICH WAY YOU WANT TO SWING? >> IT'S AN EASY PLAY TO VOTE
545,00:34:34.70,00:34:34.70,KATIE OUT. THAT'S AN EASY DECISION.
546,00:34:37.00,00:34:37.00,THE HARD DECISION IS VOTING JONATHAN OUT.
547,00:34:39.07,00:34:39.07,HE MIGHT BE NERVOUS AND PLAY THE IDOL.
548,00:34:41.37,00:34:41.37,"HELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN."
549,00:34:42.87,00:34:42.87,THIS IS A CRAP SHOOT. YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING
550,00:34:45.50,00:34:45.50,TO STRIKE OUT OR HIT A HOME RUN BUT YOU GO UP TO THE PLATE AND
551,00:34:48.10,00:34:48.10,SWING THE BAT. >> Jeff: SO WHO TONIGHT TRULY
552,00:35:19.80,00:35:19.80,FEELS THEY'RE IN TROUBLE? DENICE AND KATIE.
553,00:35:24.77,00:35:24.77,"WELL, THAT WILL MAKE IT EASY TONIGHT."
554,00:35:26.90,00:35:26.90,"DENICE, WHY ARE YOU IN TROUBLE? >> YOU KNOW I'M STILL THE NEW"
555,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,"GIRL ON THE BLOCK, SO TO SPEAK, AND THAT'S A HUGE WORRY FOR ME"
556,00:35:35.87,00:35:35.87,"TONIGHT. IT'S LIKE THE WORK FORCE, LAST"
557,00:35:37.20,00:35:37.20,ONE HIRED; FIRST ONE FIRED. BUT I'M TRYING TO SHOW MY TRIBE
558,00:35:40.83,00:35:40.83,THERE'S VALUE IN KEEPING ME FOR A NUMBERS OF REASONS.
559,00:35:46.60,00:35:46.60,">> Jeff: KATIE, WHY WOULD YOU BE IN TROUBLE WHEN YOU HAVE"
560,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,DENICE WHO SEEMS LIKE AN EASY VOTE?
561,00:35:51.13,00:35:51.13,>> BECAUSE I'M THE OTHER GIRL. I DON'T PERFORM AWESOME IN
562,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80,CHALLENGES SO IT'S LIKE I CAN ONLY OFFER SO MUCH BUT I HOPE
563,00:35:58.70,00:35:58.70,THEY CAN GO OFF OF LIVING WITH ME FOR 16 DAYS OUT HERE AND KNOW
564,00:36:02.73,00:36:02.73,THAT I'M LOYAL AND I'M WITH THEM.
565,00:36:05.70,00:36:05.70,">> Jeff: PENNER, HAVING PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE, YOU KNOW HOW"
566,00:36:09.40,00:36:09.40,"OFTEN BLIND SIDES HAPPEN. AND YET HERE YOU SIT SAYING ""I'M"
567,00:36:16.60,00:36:16.60,"NOT IN TROUBLE TONIGHT."" >> I THINK ONE DOES NOT EVEN"
568,00:36:19.97,00:36:19.97,"WANT TO VOLUNTEER ONE'S SELF AND GIVE ANYONE THE NOTION THAT,"
569,00:36:23.37,00:36:23.37,"HUH, MAYBE I SHOULD VOTE FOR PENNER."
570,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,"WHETHER I THINK I'M VULNERABLE OR NOT, I WANT TO GIVE THE"
571,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83,IMPRESSION I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT.
572,00:36:29.97,00:36:29.97,">> Jeff: JEFF, WAS LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL AN EASIER VOTE THAN THIS"
573,00:36:33.33,00:36:33.33,"ONE? >> ALWAYS, YEAH."
574,00:36:40.03,00:36:40.03,EVERY ONE OF THESE VOTE IS GOING TO HURT WORSE AND WORSE AS IT
575,00:36:43.87,00:36:43.87,GETS DEEPER. THAT'S HOW WELL WE LIKE EACH
576,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,OTHER. THAT'S HOW WELL WE GET ALONG.
577,00:36:48.63,00:36:48.63,THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A VOTE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BLIND
578,00:36:51.20,00:36:51.20,"SIDE. >> Jeff: PENNER, INTERESTING"
579,00:36:52.57,00:36:52.57,VOTE FOR FROM JEFF. EVERY VOTE IS GOING TO BE A
580,00:36:54.87,00:36:54.87,BLIND SIDE BECAUSE WE LIKE EACH OTHER SO MUCH.
581,00:36:56.23,00:36:56.23,">> HONESTLY, IT'S BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARILY DRAMA-FREE ZONE"
582,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,AND IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A BLIND SIDE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S
583,00:37:04.43,00:37:04.43,JUST EASIER TO LET THE PERSON GO AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL
584,00:37:06.87,00:37:06.87,"UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT PERSONAL, IT'S STRICTLY SO THAT WE CAN"
585,00:37:09.80,00:37:09.80,MOVE FORWARD A LITTLE FURTHER. >> Jeff: SO IF IT'S YOU THAT
586,00:37:13.53,00:37:13.53,GETS BLINDSIDED IT'S A GOOD STRATEGY.
587,00:37:15.37,00:37:15.37,>> I WOULDN'T LIKE IT IF THEY DID IT TO ME BUT I WOULD
588,00:37:18.37,00:37:18.37,APPRECIATE THE GAME PLAY. I WOULD TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IT
589,00:37:20.47,00:37:20.47,"AND WOULDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. >> Jeff: JEFF, DO YOU PLAY ANY"
590,00:37:23.23,00:37:23.23,"GAME THAT'S SIMILAR TO ""SURVIVOR"" IN TERMS OF STRATEGY?"
591,00:37:26.90,00:37:26.90,">> NO. THIS GAME SUCKS, JEFF."
592,00:37:29.37,00:37:29.37,>> Jeff: IT SUCKS? >> (LAUGHS).
593,00:37:32.60,00:37:32.60,">> Jeff: WELL, MEANING IT SUCKS IN THE GREATEST WAY"
594,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED OR YOU WISH YOU WEREN'T HERE AND YOU
595,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,"WANT TO GO HOME. >> NO, I THINK YOU KNOW WHERE"
596,00:37:39.23,00:37:39.23,"I'M COMING FROM. YOU KNOW, THIS GAME IS --"
597,00:37:41.47,00:37:41.47,">> Jeff: COMPLICATED. >> IT'S VERY, VERY COMPLICATED"
598,00:37:44.43,00:37:44.43,AND THAT'S WHY IT SUCKS BECAUSE YOU TRY TO SURVIVE THE ELEMENTS
599,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,"YOUR SNOW YOU CUDDLE WITH PEOPLE, YOU TAKE ON FRIENDS AND"
600,00:37:50.40,00:37:50.40,THAT'S WHAT SUCKS ABOUT THIS GAME.
601,00:37:53.97,00:37:53.97,YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BLIND SIDE YOUR FRIEND BECAUSE YOU'RE
602,00:37:56.77,00:37:56.77,"TOO GUILTY TO TELL THEM ""I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU HERE"
603,00:38:00.10,00:38:00.10,ANYMORE. REQUESTS THAT'S WHAT SUCKS.
604,00:38:01.53,00:38:01.53,">> Jeff: KATIE, JEFF JUST PARAPHRASED WHAT THIS SHOW IS"
605,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,ABOUT. YOU HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO
606,00:38:07.00,00:38:07.00,BUILD A WORLD BUT VOTE EACH OTHER OUT.
607,00:38:10.30,00:38:10.30,SO TONIGHT WHAT DO YOU VOTE BASED ON?
608,00:38:12.70,00:38:12.70,">> I VOTE TONIGHT BASED ON LOYALTY, BEING AROUND THESE"
609,00:38:16.57,00:38:16.57,PEOPLE FOR THE LAST 16 DAYS. AND WHEN I SAID MY WORD
610,00:38:21.40,00:38:21.40,INITIALLY I MEANT IT. AND I INTEND ON STICKING WITH
611,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,"THAT. >> Jeff: PENNER, DOES THAT"
612,00:38:27.20,00:38:27.20,"MAKE KATIE A SITTING DUCK? WHEN SOMEONE SAYS ""THE WORD I"
613,00:38:30.03,00:38:30.03,"GAVE YOU IS MY WORD AND I'M GOING TO STICK WITH IT""?"
614,00:38:33.80,00:38:33.80,>> IS THAT GAME PLAY? IS SHE JUST THROWING THAT OUT
615,00:38:36.30,00:38:36.30,NOW? IS SHE SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY
616,00:38:37.70,00:38:37.70,HERE? I'M NOT SURE.
617,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,THE REASON THAT IT'S SO COMPLICATED IS NOBODY WANTS TO
618,00:38:42.53,00:38:42.53,BETRAY ANYBODY AND NOBODY WANTS TO FEEL BETROYED.
619,00:38:44.80,00:38:44.80,THAT'S WHY THE BLIND SIDES HAPPEN.
620,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,IF IT WAS ME TONIGHT AND THESE FOUR DIDN'T GIVE ME THAT
621,00:38:49.67,00:38:49.67,"OPPORTUNITY TO SCRAMBLE, MORE POWER TO THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW"
622,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,THAT I WOULD DO ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE THIS WORK OUT AND
623,00:38:56.43,00:38:56.43,IT MIGHT RICOCHET AND ONE OF THEM WOULD GET VOTED OUT.
624,00:39:01.13,00:39:01.13,THEY WANT IT TO BE NEAT AND CLEAN AND MOVE FORWARD.
625,00:39:03.23,00:39:03.23,THAT'S HOW I'M FEELING ABOUT THE PERSON THAT I'M GOING TO VOTE
626,00:39:06.83,00:39:06.83,FOR. THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE MESSAGE
627,00:39:08.43,00:39:08.43,LOUD AND CLEAR AFTER THE VOTE SO DOING IT TO THEIR FACE ONLY ADDS
628,00:39:11.47,00:39:11.47,TO THE AGITATION FOR ALL THE REST OF US.
629,00:39:17.03,00:39:17.03,>> Jeff: SO THIS IS GREAT DRAMA.
630,00:39:19.33,00:39:19.33,"EVERYBODY KNOWS A BLIND SIDE IS COMING, THE QUESTION IS: WHO'S"
631,00:39:22.60,00:39:22.60,IT GONNA BE? IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
632,00:39:25.60,00:39:25.60,"KATIE, YOU'RE UP. >> GOOD-BYE, MY CUDDLE BEAR, YOU"
633,00:39:35.53,00:39:35.53,ARE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. >> RIGHT NOW YOU'RE THE WEAKEST
634,00:39:48.10,00:39:48.10,MEMBER OF THE TRIBE AND I NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE AS STRONG AS
635,00:39:51.77,00:39:51.77,POSSIBLE. YOU'RE A GREAT KID.
636,00:40:11.47,00:40:11.47,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
637,00:40:21.60,00:40:21.60,IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW
638,00:40:24.90,00:40:24.90,WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO. OKAY.
639,00:40:34.27,00:40:34.27,ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE DECISION IS FINAL.
640,00:40:36.57,00:40:36.57,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
641,00:40:39.43,00:40:39.43,IMMEDIATELY. I'LL READ THE VOTES.
642,00:40:43.70,00:40:43.70,"FIRST VOTE, KATIE. PENNER."
643,00:40:49.20,00:40:49.20,>> OH! >> TWO VOTES KATIE; ONE VOTE

648,00:41:30.33,00:41:30.33,GAME ABOUT NUMBERS. THE GOOD NEWS IS IF THE FOUR OF
