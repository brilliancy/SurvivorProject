3,00:00:33.43,00:00:33.43,"a small fishing village on the coast of southern Thailand,"
4,00:00:36.63,00:00:36.63,"in the heart of the ancient Orient,"
5,00:00:38.57,00:00:38.57,where these 16 Americans are about to begin
6,00:00:40.83,00:00:40.83,the adventure of a lifetime.
7,00:00:42.93,00:00:42.93,They will depart from this village
8,00:00:44.30,00:00:44.30,as a group of men and a group of women.
9,00:00:46.93,00:00:46.93,"Their destination: Tarutao Island,"
10,00:00:48.83,00:00:48.83, a beautiful  but dangerous jungle
11,00:00:51.57,00:00:51.57, which was once  a haven for pirates
12,00:00:53.63,00:00:53.63, in the middle  of the Andaman Sea.
13,00:00:55.67,00:00:55.67," Exotic and deadly  wildlife abound,"
14,00:00:57.60,00:00:57.60, including the king cobra
15,00:00:59.57,00:00:59.57," and the world's longest snake,  the reticulated python."
16,00:01:02.83,00:01:02.83," It is also the monsoon season,"
17,00:01:06.13,00:01:06.13, and the island is certain  to be pummeled
18,00:01:07.97,00:01:07.97, by frequent tropical storms.
19,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50, This will be their home  for the next 39 days.
20,00:01:13.73,00:01:13.73," They will be abandoned,  left to fend for themselves,"
21,00:01:16.50,00:01:16.50, utilizing the resources  of the land
22,00:01:18.23,00:01:18.23, and their own survival skills.
23,00:01:20.73,00:01:20.73,It is the ultimate challenge: 16 strangers forced
24,00:01:23.73,00:01:23.73,to work together to create a new society
25,00:01:26.87,00:01:26.87,while battling the elements and each other.
26,00:01:29.63,00:01:29.63,"They must learn to adapt,"
27,00:01:31.37,00:01:31.37,or they'll be voted out of the tribe.
28,00:01:33.20,00:01:33.20,"In the end, only one will remain"
29,00:01:35.27,00:01:35.27,to claim the million-dollar prize.
30,00:01:37.80,00:01:37.80,"39 days, 16 people,"

34,00:03:25.30,00:03:25.30,"Ladies on the left, men on the right."
35,00:03:28.10,00:03:28.10,Welcome to Survivor: Thailand.
36,00:03:31.20,00:03:31.20,First thing we're going to do is a little get-to-know-you.
37,00:03:33.60,00:03:33.60,"This will be your first chance to speak, and I'd like you"
38,00:03:36.13,00:03:36.13,to share a little information about yourselves:
39,00:03:38.63,00:03:38.63,"name, age, occupation."
40,00:03:41.20,00:03:41.20,"If, for some reason, that goes against"
41,00:03:42.93,00:03:42.93,your strategy of how you want
42,00:03:44.63,00:03:44.63,"to play the game, then only share what you want to share."
43,00:03:47.23,00:03:47.23,We'll start in the front left.

62,00:04:30.13,00:04:30.13,"I'm Clay Jordan, from Monroe, Louisiana,"

81,00:05:18.37,00:05:18.37,"In Thailand, the elders are treated"
82,00:05:20.43,00:05:20.43,with the utmost respect.
83,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,They are revered.
84,00:05:23.50,00:05:23.50,"So I'm going to ask the two oldest Survivors,"
85,00:05:26.37,00:05:26.37,"and if memory serves, that's you, Jake, and Jan."
86,00:05:29.90,00:05:29.90,"Guys, come up here."
87,00:05:33.90,00:05:33.90,Okay.
88,00:05:35.43,00:05:35.43,First order of business: deciding on your tribe's colors.
89,00:05:38.43,00:05:38.43,"Now, in doing so, you are also deciding"
90,00:05:42.43,00:05:42.43,your tribe name and at which beach you will live.
91,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,"Now, each beach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages."
92,00:05:49.17,00:05:49.17,"At one camp, getting shelter is going to be more difficult."
93,00:05:52.27,00:05:52.27,"At the other camp, getting water will be more difficult."
94,00:05:55.53,00:05:55.53,All I can tell you at this point--
95,00:05:57.07,00:05:57.07,"this beach has sunrise, this beach has sunset."
96,00:06:00.90,00:06:00.90,Who wants which beach?
97,00:06:03.50,00:06:03.50,Sunset.
98,00:06:04.93,00:06:04.93,Sunrise. Okay.
99,00:06:06.97,00:06:06.97,We're off and rolling.
100,00:06:08.87,00:06:08.87,"JOHN: All of a sudden, I'm, like, okay, wait a minute."
101,00:06:11.40,00:06:11.40,This has never happened before.
102,00:06:12.67,00:06:12.67, We're separated men and women.
103,00:06:14.20,00:06:14.20,"And I had to start thinking, okay,"
104,00:06:15.87,00:06:15.87,"I got to put my game face on for, you know, how do you..."
105,00:06:18.83,00:06:18.83,how do you jive with just all men in a group?
106,00:06:21.30,00:06:21.30,Your tribe: Sook Jai.
107,00:06:23.97,00:06:23.97,Sook Jai.
108,00:06:25.20,00:06:25.20,"Jan, your tribe: Chuay Gahn."
109,00:06:26.57,00:06:26.57,Chuay Gahn. (chuckles)
110,00:06:28.60,00:06:28.60,"GHANDIA: If we were going to be  an all-women tribe,"
111,00:06:30.70,00:06:30.70, I thought that we were totally
112,00:06:31.97,00:06:31.97,"going to kick the men's ass,"
113,00:06:33.73,00:06:33.73,"'cause women are just better at, like, multitasking."
114,00:06:36.60,00:06:36.60,We handle pain better.
115,00:06:37.97,00:06:37.97, We're just more logical.
116,00:06:39.77,00:06:39.77,"PROBST: Now, of course, the natural assumption"
117,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,at this point would be that we have a tribe
118,00:06:44.83,00:06:44.83,of men and a tribe of women.
119,00:06:46.23,00:06:46.23,"That assumption, of course, would be wrong."
120,00:06:49.30,00:06:49.30,You two are going to act as tribe selectors.
121,00:06:51.70,00:06:51.70,Oh.
122,00:06:53.47,00:06:53.47,And you're going to choose your own tribes-- right now.
123,00:06:58.50,00:06:58.50,Here's how it's going to work.
124,00:06:59.97,00:06:59.97,You're going to choose one member at a time.
125,00:07:02.73,00:07:02.73,You will alternate between men and women.
126,00:07:05.20,00:07:05.20,And you'll begin by selecting a member of the opposite sex.
127,00:07:08.73,00:07:08.73,"Jan, you get first choice."
128,00:07:12.73,00:07:12.73,"When Jeff said that we were picking the tribes, I really..."
129,00:07:17.13,00:07:17.13,"um, I really did kind of get scared."
130,00:07:19.27,00:07:19.27," I was scared because, um,  I'm not really a leader, and I"
131,00:07:23.77,00:07:23.77,"was put in the spotlight, which kind of frightened me."
132,00:07:26.93,00:07:26.93,PROBST: Do you know who that is?
133,00:07:28.37,00:07:28.37,-I can't remember. -Ted.
134,00:07:30.20,00:07:30.20,-Ted? Jan. -Mm-hmm. Hey.
135,00:07:32.10,00:07:32.10,"Jake, pick a woman."
136,00:07:36.80,00:07:36.80,"JAKE: It really puts you  on the spot, you know?"
137,00:07:38.50,00:07:38.50,"The first person I picked was Stephanie, and I guarantee you,"
138,00:07:42.00,00:07:42.00,"if you look in that girl's eyes and then you look at her body,"
139,00:07:44.47,00:07:44.47,you know that this lady is...
140,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13, is ready to take on the world.
141,00:07:48.50,00:07:48.50,"Jan, you're picking a woman."
142,00:07:50.00,00:07:50.00,Right there.
143,00:07:51.73,00:07:51.73,PROBST: You picked Helen.
144,00:07:53.10,00:07:53.10,Jake.
145,00:07:54.93,00:07:54.93,The cop from New York City.
146,00:07:57.90,00:07:57.90,"JOHN: You know, initially,  I'm looking at what looks like"
147,00:07:59.47,00:07:59.47," a pretty strong guy  and, it looks like,"
148,00:08:01.03,00:08:01.03," sort of a weak elderly lady,  and I'm thinking,"
149,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,"""Holy moley, I hope I get on the strong guy's team."""
150,00:08:04.90,00:08:04.90,PROBST: Jan.
151,00:08:08.33,00:08:08.33,Um...
152,00:08:09.47,00:08:09.47,You picked John.
153,00:08:12.37,00:08:12.37,"All right, Jake."
154,00:08:13.97,00:08:13.97,"Plano, Texas."
155,00:08:15.70,00:08:15.70,"PROBST: Penny, now a member of Sook Jai."
156,00:08:18.43,00:08:18.43,"Jan, who's the next member of Chuay Gahn?"
157,00:08:20.97,00:08:20.97,On the back.
158,00:08:21.80,00:08:21.80,-Me? -Uh-huh.
159,00:08:23.07,00:08:23.07,PROBST: Ghandia.
160,00:08:24.90,00:08:24.90,"Jake, you're picking a guy."
161,00:08:26.90,00:08:26.90,"JED: Jake's demeanor,  I was drawn to."
162,00:08:29.53,00:08:29.53," You know, he picked people  I would also be drawn to--"
163,00:08:32.40,00:08:32.40, the younger crowd  or the athletic crowd.
164,00:08:34.90,00:08:34.90,"I thought, ""Man, I really want to be on that team."""
165,00:08:38.10,00:08:38.10,And so my heart was pumping
166,00:08:39.57,00:08:39.57, when everyone was picking.
167,00:08:42.90,00:08:42.90,"PROBST: Jed, Mr. Dentist--"
168,00:08:45.07,00:08:45.07,you're in Sook Jai.
169,00:08:47.50,00:08:47.50,"All right, Jan."
170,00:08:50.97,00:08:50.97,ROBB: I didn't want to be  on the little old lady's team.
171,00:08:53.83,00:08:53.83,"Like, after I saw who she started picking,"
172,00:08:56.70,00:08:56.70, I'm sitting there-- and it  was... it was her pick--
173,00:08:59.00,00:08:59.00," and I'm thinking to myself,"
174,00:09:00.40,00:09:00.40," ""Don't make eye contact,  don't make eye contact."""
175,00:09:03.40,00:09:03.40,Got to have some music.
176,00:09:04.77,00:09:04.77,-(Jan laughing) -PROBST: Brian.
177,00:09:06.80,00:09:06.80,Come on down. I can't sing nothing.
178,00:09:08.40,00:09:08.40,PROBST: Comes with guitar.
179,00:09:10.53,00:09:10.53,"All right, Jake."
180,00:09:13.43,00:09:13.43,"Shii Ann, on the Sook Jai."
181,00:09:15.33,00:09:15.33,"Jan, you're up."
182,00:09:17.07,00:09:17.07,TANYA:  There's a lot of anxiety.
183,00:09:18.43,00:09:18.43,"I think everybody sitting there  was thinking,"
184,00:09:20.80,00:09:20.80,"you know, you don't want to look like, you know,"
185,00:09:22.97,00:09:22.97,that you're the last person picked.
186,00:09:26.87,00:09:26.87,Right there.
187,00:09:28.23,00:09:28.23,PROBST: You picked Tanya.
188,00:09:32.07,00:09:32.07,"All right, Jake."
189,00:09:33.57,00:09:33.57,I want my skateboarding buddy back there.
190,00:09:36.33,00:09:36.33,"ROBB: What's up, y'all?"
191,00:09:37.70,00:09:37.70,I get to talk! Yes!
192,00:09:39.63,00:09:39.63,"I love you guys, and I haven't even talked to you yet!"
193,00:09:43.43,00:09:43.43,God!
194,00:09:44.73,00:09:44.73,"PROBST: Well, just like in fifth-grade dodge ball,"
195,00:09:47.43,00:09:47.43,somebody's got to be last.
196,00:09:48.47,00:09:48.47,"Jan, your last choice?"
197,00:09:49.97,00:09:49.97,Golfer!
198,00:09:51.50,00:09:51.50,"PROBST: Clay, now a member of Chuay Gahn."
199,00:09:54.53,00:09:54.53,CLAY: I'm the smallest and  the oldest one sitting there.
200,00:09:58.23,00:09:58.23,"Now, I knew I was going to be last,"
201,00:10:00.10,00:10:00.10,"but they got, uh, a diamond in the..."
202,00:10:01.73,00:10:01.73,in the rough's what they don't know.
203,00:10:03.60,00:10:03.60,"PROBST: Jake, pick your last official selection."
204,00:10:05.60,00:10:05.60,"All right, now!"
205,00:10:07.43,00:10:07.43,"(applause, whooping)"
206,00:10:08.63,00:10:08.63,ERIN:  You've got to be kidding me!
207,00:10:10.37,00:10:10.37,I'm the last one? Come on!
208,00:10:12.70,00:10:12.70,I can give so much to this tribe.
209,00:10:15.10,00:10:15.10, Being picked last  is very humbling.
210,00:10:17.00,00:10:17.00, I probably needed  that experience.
211,00:10:19.40,00:10:19.40,PROBST: We have our two tribes: Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn.
212,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,JAKE: I don't know  what Jan was thinking
213,00:10:31.13,00:10:31.13, when she picked the people  that she picked.
214,00:10:33.47,00:10:33.47,"I like to see athletic-looking people,"
215,00:10:35.93,00:10:35.93," so I based picking a team  on athleticism,"
216,00:10:39.50,00:10:39.50, and just that gleam  in their eye that looks like
217,00:10:42.33,00:10:42.33, they'll be there  for the duration.
218,00:10:44.27,00:10:44.27,"Sook Jai, Sook Jai, Sook Jai, Sook Jai!"
219,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,PENNY: I think Jake is in great shape for being 60.
220,00:10:50.00,00:10:50.00, I think we probably have
221,00:10:51.23,00:10:51.23, the four best-looking guys  on our tribe
222,00:10:54.10,00:10:54.10,than the other four that are sitting over there.
223,00:10:56.60,00:10:56.60, Absolutely.
224,00:10:58.33,00:10:58.33,The first thing we'll do-- we'll build a latrine.
225,00:11:01.37,00:11:01.37,"TED: I was surprised  by, uh, Jan's picks."
226,00:11:04.13,00:11:04.13,It seems like most of the tribe members
227,00:11:06.10,00:11:06.10,"were older members, if you will."
228,00:11:08.47,00:11:08.47," The other tribe,  they were extremely excited"
229,00:11:10.63,00:11:10.63, because they think  they'll be able
230,00:11:12.43,00:11:12.43," to walk over us  in challenges, etc."
231,00:11:15.13,00:11:15.13,They're going to be surprised.
232,00:11:16.83,00:11:16.83,"On board both boats,"
233,00:11:19.03,00:11:19.03,"identical set of supplies-- very, very meager."
234,00:11:22.30,00:11:22.30,"And for food, each tribe gets one small can of beans."
235,00:11:26.10,00:11:26.10,You are definitely going to have to work together
236,00:11:28.53,00:11:28.53,to build your new world.
237,00:11:29.70,00:11:29.70,The day is already very late.
238,00:11:32.13,00:11:32.13,The weather is very temperamental.
239,00:11:34.07,00:11:34.07,I suggest you get on your boat and get out to your camps.
240,00:11:36.57,00:11:36.57,Look for your tribe flag and the small fishing canoe.
241,00:11:40.43,00:11:40.43,Get out of here.
242,00:11:59.40,00:11:59.40,"HELEN: We figured out quickly,  as a team, that we needed"
243,00:12:02.40,00:12:02.40,"to turn the boat around,"
244,00:12:03.77,00:12:03.77,and the other team didn't figure that out.
245,00:12:05.90,00:12:05.90," The other team is, um,  quite a bit younger, and..."
246,00:12:09.03,00:12:09.03, they're anxious little kids.
247,00:12:10.27,00:12:10.27,"And they just got in the boat-- paddle, paddle!"
248,00:12:11.73,00:12:11.73,"They were thinking it was a race, and we knew it wasn't."
249,00:12:14.60,00:12:14.60,"JOHN: Okay, guys. Let's go."
250,00:12:16.83,00:12:16.83,"-Paddles in the water. -Go, Granny, go."
251,00:12:18.57,00:12:18.57,"-Go, Granny, go! -Right side. Right side."
252,00:12:20.50,00:12:20.50,Right side. Right side.
253,00:12:22.07,00:12:22.07,JOHN:  I found it interesting
254,00:12:23.60,00:12:23.60,to... to realize that none of our team
255,00:12:26.07,00:12:26.07,understood how to paddle a boat.
256,00:12:28.40,00:12:28.40,"Okay, right side. Give us just a minute."
257,00:12:30.27,00:12:30.27,"Okay, right side."
258,00:12:32.00,00:12:32.00,"You paddle on the right, you go left;"
259,00:12:33.63,00:12:33.63,"you paddle on the left, you go right."
260,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30," I mean, we're turning in a big"
261,00:12:36.73,00:12:36.73," left-hand circle here  and, you know,"
262,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17, people on the right  are just powering away.
263,00:12:40.77,00:12:40.77,-Stroke! Stroke! -Dig it in.
264,00:12:42.27,00:12:42.27,-Stroke! -There we go.
265,00:12:43.47,00:12:43.47,Stroke! Stroke!
266,00:12:45.47,00:12:45.47,"JOHN: All right, right side, we're starting to turn a little."
267,00:12:47.87,00:12:47.87,"-Right side, let up. -Go a little bit easy."
268,00:12:49.77,00:12:49.77,Y'all don't have to stop. Just go easy.
269,00:12:51.70,00:12:51.70,"TANYA: On the way over here,  you could see"
270,00:12:53.57,00:12:53.57, who was wanting  to take leadership roles--
271,00:12:55.13,00:12:55.13, they would tell you  what to do-- and...
272,00:12:57.00,00:12:57.00," and John,  in particular, he wanted"
273,00:12:58.33,00:12:58.33, to get here  as fast as we could.
274,00:13:00.27,00:13:00.27,"This team, you know, we had a lot of the older group,"
275,00:13:03.17,00:13:03.17,"and, um, I'm the youngest one here, and..."
276,00:13:05.67,00:13:05.67," I was hoping I would be  on the other tribe, actually."
277,00:13:08.00,00:13:08.00, I got stuck with the group  that I didn't really think
278,00:13:10.30,00:13:10.30,I could relate to.
279,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50,Chuay Gahn!
280,00:13:13.00,00:13:13.00,(all whooping)
281,00:13:19.87,00:13:19.87,JAKE:  We didn't realize
282,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50, that we were paddling  the boat backwards.
283,00:13:23.80,00:13:23.80,(laughs) I was steering the boat
284,00:13:26.63,00:13:26.63, from the foredeck.
285,00:13:32.00,00:13:32.00,"ROBB: And I'm, like,  ""Our boat is backwards."""
286,00:13:33.97,00:13:33.97," And we all started laughing,  and we're, like, ""Who cares?"""
287,00:13:36.47,00:13:36.47,I think the thing went faster backwards than it did forwards.
288,00:13:56.67,00:13:56.67,SHII ANN: In an ideal  situation--
289,00:13:58.23,00:13:58.23," what should have happened  is we should have landed,"
290,00:14:00.60,00:14:00.60," we should have hugged,  and we would've"
291,00:14:03.13,00:14:03.13,immediately drawn up the plans for shelter
292,00:14:05.30,00:14:05.30,and started dispatching people to do whatever.
293,00:14:08.80,00:14:08.80,-The map! -The map.
294,00:14:10.57,00:14:10.57,-Great! -Nice. Nice. Nice.
295,00:14:12.50,00:14:12.50,-Gully. -Mango tree.
296,00:14:13.70,00:14:13.70,-Mango tree. -Mango tree!
297,00:14:17.27,00:14:17.27,"SHII ANN:  But instead,"
298,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,"we all went, you know, wild."
299,00:14:21.07,00:14:21.07,I can't believe you're climbing a mango tree.
300,00:14:23.70,00:14:23.70,Do you see a mango anywhere?
301,00:14:25.07,00:14:25.07,Do you see anything?
302,00:14:26.90,00:14:26.90,-There's nothing. -ROBB: You can totally swing
303,00:14:28.37,00:14:28.37,"on this, you guys."
304,00:14:30.50,00:14:30.50,(laughing)

306,00:14:35.13,00:14:35.13,"I mean, the boy has got more enthusiasm and energy"
307,00:14:37.83,00:14:37.83,than anybody I've ever seen.
308,00:14:39.47,00:14:39.47,"Dude, check it out! Whoo-hoo!"
309,00:14:42.27,00:14:42.27,"JAKE:  You know, I've got a crew"

319,00:15:20.43,00:15:20.43, and trying to figure  everybody out.
320,00:15:22.03,00:15:22.03," I'm having a good time  doing it,"

324,00:15:30.43,00:15:30.43,we're no longer... we're no longer a team.

334,00:15:59.10,00:15:59.10,TED: The good thing  that we noticed
335,00:16:01.53,00:16:01.53, right off the bat  was that there were caves.
336,00:16:05.30,00:16:05.30,"So that means our first element was basically covered,"
337,00:16:07.43,00:16:07.43,if the caves were safe.
338,00:16:09.80,00:16:09.80,What-what kind of track's making this?

340,00:16:13.30,00:16:13.30,This may be a good place for us to set a fire.

400,00:18:24.87,00:18:24.87,Just kind of waded out there a little bit and dipped down.
401,00:18:28.23,00:18:28.23,You done?
402,00:18:29.47,00:18:29.47,"-Madam, your clothing. -Thank you."
403,00:18:32.47,00:18:32.47,"Oh, my God. She is wild."
404,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,"She's crazy. I mean,"
405,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13," don't get me wrong,  going skinny-dipping--"
406,00:18:38.10,00:18:38.10," everyone should do it, but..."
407,00:18:40.07,00:18:40.07,you will not see my ta-tas.
408,00:18:41.77,00:18:41.77,You look good in the moonlight.
409,00:18:43.10,00:18:43.10,"-It suits you. -Well, thank you."
410,00:18:44.77,00:18:44.77,"JAKE: After we kind of  calmed down a little bit,"
411,00:18:47.53,00:18:47.53,we knew that we had to get something--
412,00:18:49.30,00:18:49.30,"uh, some form of a shelter."
413,00:18:51.20,00:18:51.20," We built, uh,  kind of a halfway shelter"
414,00:18:53.57,00:18:53.57, that we knew we were going  to tear down and rebuild.
415,00:18:56.27,00:18:56.27, Nobody was proud of it.
416,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,"Location and everything sucks,"
417,00:18:59.07,00:18:59.07,"but dude, it was so spur-of-the-moment."
418,00:19:00.47,00:19:00.47,We got the entire day tomorrow.
419,00:19:01.90,00:19:01.90,Are you sure we can all fit in here?
420,00:19:03.63,00:19:03.63,"-Come on. -Good night, you guys."
421,00:19:05.13,00:19:05.13,-Good night. -Good night.
422,00:19:06.37,00:19:06.37,"Good night, dream team."
423,00:19:07.53,00:19:07.53,"""Good night, dream team?"" (laughs)"
424,00:19:09.03,00:19:09.03,"Hey, where's my skateboard?"
425,00:19:10.67,00:19:10.67,(laughter)
426,00:19:25.27,00:19:25.27,"TED: Hey, don't worry about it."
427,00:19:27.83,00:19:27.83,You just got to get used to the... your stomach and stuff's
428,00:19:30.43,00:19:30.43,got to get used to this environment.
429,00:19:32.47,00:19:32.47,I think I'm about to be sick.
430,00:19:41.03,00:19:41.03,JOHN:  Tanya got a little sick.
431,00:19:43.17,00:19:43.17,I think what it is is that she just got dehydrated.
432,00:19:46.03,00:19:46.03,I don't think I drank enough water yesterday.
433,00:19:48.00,00:19:48.00,"Just, here. Just take some. Here."
434,00:19:50.20,00:19:50.20, GHANDIA: We need to stay  hydrated because water
435,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,is one of the most important things out here with the heat.
436,00:19:55.60,00:19:55.60, So we decided we would all go  to find the water source.
437,00:19:58.90,00:19:58.90,-You ready? -Yeah. Let's do it.
438,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10,-Let's go. -Let's go.
439,00:20:03.03,00:20:03.03,"GHANDIA: We had just gone in the water and started trekking,"
440,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00," and John, he came to this crevice, and he's like,"
441,00:20:08.47,00:20:08.47,"""Well, let's climb up in here."""
442,00:20:10.00,00:20:10.00,"-John, let's walk. -Well, I... I can walk on the edge"
443,00:20:12.60,00:20:12.60,along the top.
444,00:20:13.97,00:20:13.97,It's actually not a bad climb.
445,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,"-Be careful, man. -Uh-huh."
446,00:20:18.50,00:20:18.50,We got you.
447,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,You straight?
448,00:20:22.37,00:20:22.37,-I'll meet you all around the corner. -Okay.
449,00:20:24.03,00:20:24.03,"I... really, I want to see what..."
450,00:20:25.73,00:20:25.73,-what fruit trees we have up here. -Okay.
451,00:20:27.80,00:20:27.80,And... and that sort of thing.
452,00:20:29.17,00:20:29.17,"All right, John, we're walking."
453,00:20:30.47,00:20:30.47,"Be careful, man. Be safe."
454,00:20:32.30,00:20:32.30,"JAN: We don't need to be  separating like that,"
455,00:20:34.33,00:20:34.33," but some people get eager  and say,"
456,00:20:36.33,00:20:36.33," ""Well, we don't need to stay."
457,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,"We want to go on and check it out."""
458,00:20:39.60,00:20:39.60,"You know, I'll... I'll laugh"
459,00:20:41.17,00:20:41.17,if we get there and John is there before us.
460,00:20:44.00,00:20:44.00,(laughter)
461,00:20:45.90,00:20:45.90,-See that sand over there? -Yeah.
462,00:20:47.13,00:20:47.13,That's where we need to go.
463,00:20:48.63,00:20:48.63,-I think that's where we need to go-- up in the jungle. -Okay.
464,00:20:51.27,00:20:51.27,"HELEN: Well, we thought  we had the map figured out,"
465,00:20:52.90,00:20:52.90," and we thought, ""Well,  all right, it's dumping us off"
466,00:20:54.43,00:20:54.43,"in the middle of the jungle here."""
467,00:20:55.77,00:20:55.77,I guess we're going to have to start scaling cliffs.
468,00:20:57.43,00:20:57.43,"There's a little path, right, and once we get..."
469,00:20:59.30,00:20:59.30,"this is just the hardest part right here, Ghandia."
470,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,Right here.
471,00:21:04.10,00:21:04.10,Hold my hand.
472,00:21:06.00,00:21:06.00,"Here, hand that to me."
473,00:21:07.13,00:21:07.13,"Just stick it in front of you, Tanya."
474,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,"-Got it, Brian? -Yeah."
475,00:21:10.03,00:21:10.03,-Got it. -You all right?
476,00:21:11.73,00:21:11.73,And we might even run into John.
477,00:21:13.73,00:21:13.73,"-Let's hope. -There's no way that,"
478,00:21:15.30,00:21:15.30,"if this is the water source, that we're supposed"
479,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,to be able to come up here
480,00:21:18.57,00:21:18.57,"every couple days with a big, huge gallon jug"
481,00:21:20.33,00:21:20.33,and fill it up and go back down again.
482,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,So I... I don't think we're on the right track.
483,00:21:25.23,00:21:25.23,"No, and I really don't feel confident"
484,00:21:26.90,00:21:26.90,in my rock-climbing skills.
485,00:21:28.47,00:21:28.47,"GHANDIA:  We came down the hill,"
486,00:21:29.93,00:21:29.93,"and then when we got back to... down to the bottom,"
487,00:21:32.20,00:21:32.20, here comes John--  he's back now.
488,00:21:34.00,00:21:34.00,"By the time I got there, I said,"
489,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,"""Well, here, let me take a look at the map."""
490,00:21:36.60,00:21:36.60," And I looked at the map,  and I'm like,"
491,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17," ""Okay, you know what?  I think maybe we need"
492,00:21:39.80,00:21:39.80," to go around this other bend  over here."""
493,00:21:41.40,00:21:41.40, And so Helen and I and Tanya  took the boat over there.
494,00:21:45.03,00:21:45.03,Y'all find that water. I'm feeling good.
495,00:21:47.87,00:21:47.87,"HELEN: Everybody else  decided they would follow,"
496,00:21:50.30,00:21:50.30," but by this time,  the water had come in,"
497,00:21:53.23,00:21:53.23,so they decided to come in swimming.
498,00:21:56.77,00:21:56.77,"-Ghandia, are you okay? -Yeah."
499,00:21:58.43,00:21:58.43,-It's deep water. -Okay.
500,00:22:04.40,00:22:04.40,"GHANDIA:  So we swam,"
501,00:22:05.80,00:22:05.80,"I think, maybe... it seemed like a mile."
502,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,-You guys okay? -Yeah.
503,00:22:15.77,00:22:15.77,Water hole in jungle-- wouldn't that...
504,00:22:17.57,00:22:17.57,wouldn't that be that way?
505,00:22:18.87,00:22:18.87,"Well, the jungle's all through here,"
506,00:22:20.40,00:22:20.40,and there's a path over there.
507,00:22:21.80,00:22:21.80,"JOHN: But first,  we came in, and we saw"
508,00:22:25.17,00:22:25.17," this big, ugly pool  of brackish water"
509,00:22:27.13,00:22:27.13, that had been stagnant  and sitting there.
510,00:22:29.30,00:22:29.30," We're like, ""Oh, my goodness."""
511,00:22:31.30,00:22:31.30,"I don't know, Helen. I don't know."
512,00:22:33.03,00:22:33.03,"HELEN: Taste it... taste it, and see if it's brackish."
513,00:22:35.57,00:22:35.57,-Hold my hand. -Yeah.
514,00:22:37.90,00:22:37.90,-Just a touch. -Here?
515,00:22:39.23,00:22:39.23,"Just... yeah, just to the lips."
516,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,"-Oh, yeah. It's definitely salt water. -Is it?"
517,00:22:42.13,00:22:42.13,JOHN: So we ran around  looking for other spots.
518,00:22:43.77,00:22:43.77," Just a few feet up the trail,"
519,00:22:45.33,00:22:45.33," there was a big,  round piece of wood"
520,00:22:47.30,00:22:47.30, that indicated  our water source.
521,00:22:49.37,00:22:49.37,It's clear.
522,00:22:51.57,00:22:51.57,"Give me some skin, baby."
523,00:22:53.60,00:22:53.60,That's awesome.
524,00:23:01.80,00:23:01.80,"JOHN:  When they come,"
525,00:23:03.27,00:23:03.27,"I'll say, ""Come on, guys. We found the water hole."""
526,00:23:04.90,00:23:04.90,"And we'll take them back here, and we'll show them"
527,00:23:06.37,00:23:06.37,"the brackish stuff and say, you know,"
528,00:23:07.90,00:23:07.90,"""What we're going to have to do is filter it when we get back,"""
529,00:23:09.83,00:23:09.83,-and just kind of fool them. You want to do that? -Yeah.
530,00:23:11.50,00:23:11.50,-That's fine. -And just kind of... just kind of keep
531,00:23:12.90,00:23:12.90,fooling them a little bit until they notice the tank.
532,00:23:14.30,00:23:14.30,"And they'll go, ""No way!"""
533,00:23:15.53,00:23:15.53,-And then we'll laugh it off. -Yeah.
534,00:23:16.87,00:23:16.87,GHANDIA:  And when we got in eyesight
535,00:23:18.93,00:23:18.93," of John and Tanya and Helen,"
536,00:23:21.40,00:23:21.40,I was kind of wondering why
537,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,John or Helen didn't come out and get us with the canoe.
538,00:23:27.43,00:23:27.43,CLAY: Push the canoe out here!
539,00:23:30.03,00:23:30.03,Retards.
540,00:23:32.30,00:23:32.30,Y'all didn't see me lose my...?
541,00:23:34.57,00:23:34.57,We're about to freaking drown out here.
542,00:23:36.57,00:23:36.57,"GHANDIA: And then, when we got  there, John decides"
543,00:23:39.07,00:23:39.07,that it would be funny to play a joke on us.
544,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,All we can figure is that we can filter it
545,00:23:43.27,00:23:43.27,"and then boil it, huh? What do you think?"
546,00:23:46.83,00:23:46.83,TED: Yeah...
547,00:23:48.30,00:23:48.30,"JOHN: Or maybe we can, uh, take the lid off"
548,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,of that tank and get some out of there.
549,00:23:52.30,00:23:52.30,-TED: What's in there? -JOHN: Fresh water.
550,00:23:53.73,00:23:53.73,JAN: Why don't we go that way? Why can't we do that?
551,00:23:56.27,00:23:56.27,-That's our water tank. -Oh!
552,00:23:58.50,00:23:58.50,-And look at how clean it is. -Yay!
553,00:24:01.07,00:24:01.07,-Oh! -Oh...
554,00:24:04.33,00:24:04.33,GHANDIA:  I was happy.
555,00:24:05.60,00:24:05.60," And I was telling him,  you know,"
556,00:24:07.43,00:24:07.43,"""That was really... that was a good joke."" (mock laughs)"
557,00:24:10.03,00:24:10.03," But then, in my mind,  I'm thinking that's..."
558,00:24:11.77,00:24:11.77, it wasn't really a time  to joke about that just then.
559,00:24:23.70,00:24:23.70,ERIN: What are we doing here?
560,00:24:25.53,00:24:25.53,KEN: Looks like the water hole.
561,00:24:30.00,00:24:30.00,ERIN: Oh!
562,00:24:31.30,00:24:31.30,KEN: I think we got water.
563,00:24:33.97,00:24:33.97,"-Oh, my God. -It looks pretty clear to me."
564,00:24:36.13,00:24:36.13,"That is clear, clean drinking water."
565,00:24:38.20,00:24:38.20,-(chuckling) -Yeah!
566,00:24:40.67,00:24:40.67,So we don't have to go
567,00:24:41.80,00:24:41.80,to the other end of the jungle to get it.
568,00:24:43.53,00:24:43.53,"KEN: Thankfully, the water hole  we found today"
569,00:24:45.53,00:24:45.53, was very close by--  maybe 100 yards away.
570,00:24:48.07,00:24:48.07," The water looks clear,  even though"
571,00:24:49.77,00:24:49.77,we're definitely going to have to boil it.
572,00:24:51.60,00:24:51.60,But it... it looks like it'll help us out.
573,00:24:55.27,00:24:55.27,"ROBB: Dude, I think... honestly, I think we can do"
574,00:24:56.97,00:24:56.97,a really good job with this.
575,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,"Dude, this is totally going to work."
576,00:24:59.50,00:24:59.50,"-You guys know that, right? -Yeah, that's right."
577,00:25:00.90,00:25:00.90,PENNY: We spent a lot of time  building the foundation
578,00:25:03.67,00:25:03.67,for what's going to be our final shelter.
579,00:25:06.47,00:25:06.47,-This is going to be so nice. -It's going to be so nice.
580,00:25:08.87,00:25:08.87,"Oh, yeah, this is going to be cool."
581,00:25:10.43,00:25:10.43,"-We're going to have a good time. -It's so soft, you know?"
582,00:25:12.50,00:25:12.50,JED: My tribe's  priorities right now
583,00:25:14.07,00:25:14.07,are kind of getting out of whack.
584,00:25:16.43,00:25:16.43," Their priorities are shelter,"
585,00:25:17.83,00:25:17.83, and no one's thinking  about anything else.
586,00:25:19.73,00:25:19.73," I'll mention food,  and everyone's like,"
587,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23," ""No, I want a floor.""  I mean, come on."
588,00:25:24.13,00:25:24.13," People are going to get  really hungry,"
589,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,and we've got to just split work up
590,00:25:27.40,00:25:27.40,or it's not going to get done.
591,00:25:32.40,00:25:32.40,"ROBB: Jed, he likes to kind of do, I guess, whatever he wants."
592,00:25:36.27,00:25:36.27," Like, he went fishing, which  hasn't produced anything yet."
593,00:25:39.13,00:25:39.13,"But, um, we really need his strength,"
594,00:25:40.47,00:25:40.47,"like, when it comes to building a shelter."
595,00:25:45.70,00:25:45.70,"I'm sick of chopping, dude."
596,00:25:46.90,00:25:46.90,I've been doing it ever since I got here.
597,00:25:48.17,00:25:48.17,Look at our hands. Look at our damn hands.
598,00:25:49.73,00:25:49.73,I know. Exactly. I'm going to see him when he gets back.
599,00:25:51.63,00:25:51.63,Look at his hands. His hands are...
600,00:25:52.80,00:25:52.80,-are like he just washed them. -I know.
601,00:26:00.47,00:26:00.47,"Hey, your hand's cut. Let me do it."
602,00:26:04.13,00:26:04.13,My hands have been cut for days.
603,00:26:05.80,00:26:05.80,"I know, so why... why do it?"
604,00:26:07.33,00:26:07.33,I'll do it. Just lay it out.
605,00:26:08.83,00:26:08.83,I mean...
606,00:26:12.37,00:26:12.37,"ROBB: The way I look at it is,  we're spinning our wheels."
607,00:26:14.83,00:26:14.83,So many people are going in so many directions
608,00:26:16.73,00:26:16.73,"and doing stuff, and it's... they're not producing anything."
609,00:26:18.67,00:26:18.67,"Hey, Shii Ann, if we all can start, like,"
610,00:26:20.53,00:26:20.53,bringing fronds over and stuff.
611,00:26:22.03,00:26:22.03,Over here from the other stuff.
612,00:26:24.07,00:26:24.07,I was asked to go get food.
613,00:26:25.50,00:26:25.50,We need food as well as we need shelter.
614,00:26:27.43,00:26:27.43,Look at my hands. Let me see your hands.
615,00:26:28.77,00:26:28.77,-I understand your hands. -Let me see your hands.
616,00:26:30.07,00:26:30.07,"Dude, I was told to go get food."
617,00:26:31.70,00:26:31.70,"Okay, I'm not saying that, sweetie. Let me see your hands."
618,00:26:33.70,00:26:33.70,"-That's my point, dude. -Listen, I'm not here"
619,00:26:35.20,00:26:35.20,"to be yelled at by you, dude."
620,00:26:36.40,00:26:36.40,"I'm not yelling at you, sweetie."
621,00:26:37.60,00:26:37.60,"I'm saying I want to sleep tonight, okay?"
622,00:26:38.93,00:26:38.93,"How'd you sleep last night? Pretty good, huh?"
623,00:26:40.60,00:26:40.60,My point exactly. Walk away.
624,00:26:42.47,00:26:42.47,"I was told to go get food, man. I can't take this."
625,00:26:44.80,00:26:44.80,"Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey."
626,00:26:45.87,00:26:45.87,What do... What do you want me to do?
627,00:26:47.30,00:26:47.30,"Hey, hey. Come here. Come here."
628,00:26:48.57,00:26:48.57,SHII ANN: He is messing  with the wrong girl.
629,00:26:50.90,00:26:50.90, You do not mess
630,00:26:52.80,00:26:52.80,"with the Shii-Devil and not get the horns, okay?"
631,00:26:55.73,00:26:55.73,Do you want me to get food?
632,00:26:57.27,00:26:57.27,Do you want me to get coconut fronds?
633,00:26:59.30,00:26:59.30,I sent you to get the food-- that was my decision--
634,00:27:02.00,00:27:02.00,but these guys don't want you to do that now.
635,00:27:04.30,00:27:04.30,"Yeah, it's super frustrating. All we've been doing"
636,00:27:05.77,00:27:05.77,"-is talking. -Dude, don't talk to me."
637,00:27:07.10,00:27:07.10,"Babe, just help. Help."
638,00:27:09.47,00:27:09.47,On... on Shii Ann--
639,00:27:10.80,00:27:10.80,you should have come down on me and not her.
640,00:27:12.80,00:27:12.80,ROBB: I'm trying to be rational. I want to sleep
641,00:27:14.60,00:27:14.60,-where it's not raining. -JAKE: Cut everybody
642,00:27:16.00,00:27:16.00,a little bit of slack. Nobody's had a damn bit of food.
643,00:27:18.53,00:27:18.53,"-I haven't either, man. Believe me. -I know."
644,00:27:20.97,00:27:20.97,"You got to agree with him, though. We got to get this done."
645,00:27:23.17,00:27:23.17,"That's what I'm... that's all I'm trying to say, dude."
646,00:27:25.03,00:27:25.03,Looks like it could rain soon.
647,00:27:26.30,00:27:26.30,(thunder rumbling)
648,00:27:43.37,00:27:43.37,(screaming)
649,00:27:44.73,00:27:44.73,You see now why shelter is so important?
650,00:28:01.10,00:28:01.10,"PENNY: So far, our priority  has been shelter, so..."
651,00:28:03.93,00:28:03.93,"we have not eaten,"
652,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,"and I think it's starting to take a toll on us,"
653,00:28:07.63,00:28:07.63,even though we say that it's not.
654,00:28:12.37,00:28:12.37,-That's it. -What is this?
655,00:28:13.77,00:28:13.77,I don't know. I don't even know...
656,00:28:15.23,00:28:15.23,"I hope it's in English, not Thai."
657,00:28:17.47,00:28:17.47,"Hey, you guys."
658,00:28:18.63,00:28:18.63,-Treemail is here! -Mail!

670,00:28:45.83,00:28:45.83,-(laughing) -ROBB: That other team--
671,00:28:47.57,00:28:47.57, they're definitely inferior  to our youth and our strength.
672,00:28:50.37,00:28:50.37,We definitely got all the hot chicks...
673,00:28:52.30,00:28:52.30,or most of them.
674,00:28:53.90,00:28:53.90,"And we definitely got the young, strong guys, which is huge."
675,00:29:02.87,00:29:02.87,(thunder rumbling)
676,00:29:04.93,00:29:04.93,"PROBST: All right, guys."
677,00:29:06.87,00:29:06.87,Welcome to your first challenge.
678,00:29:08.13,00:29:08.13,"It is for immunity. Now, to succeed"
679,00:29:10.43,00:29:10.43," on Survivor,  it requires the mental ability"
680,00:29:13.03,00:29:13.03,to think through and solve problems.
681,00:29:15.07,00:29:15.07,It also requires the physical ability
682,00:29:17.27,00:29:17.27,to execute those tasks while dealing
683,00:29:19.70,00:29:19.70,"with the unexpected, like rain."
684,00:29:21.07,00:29:21.07,"First challenge-- much the same way,"
685,00:29:22.80,00:29:22.80,"it will require brawn at times, but it will also require brains."
686,00:29:27.20,00:29:27.20,"It's a race around this small island,"
687,00:29:29.57,00:29:29.57,and it begins like this: you're going to paddle out
688,00:29:31.53,00:29:31.53," through the two buoys,  make your way to a station"
689,00:29:34.40,00:29:34.40, where you'll find a rope maze.
690,00:29:36.43,00:29:36.43, Choose one member  from your tribe
691,00:29:37.77,00:29:37.77, to move the rope  through the maze.
692,00:29:40.13,00:29:40.13," When you solve it,  it'll release your flag."
693,00:29:42.47,00:29:42.47," Retrieve it, get on your boat,"
694,00:29:43.87,00:29:43.87," move to the next station,  which is simple."
695,00:29:45.60,00:29:45.60, A different tribe member  will dive down ten feet
696,00:29:48.47,00:29:48.47," and unhook your flag,  and get it on your boat."
697,00:29:51.70,00:29:51.70, The last station  is a traditional Thai puzzle.
698,00:29:54.70,00:29:54.70, You'll choose one more  tribe member to maneuver
699,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17, the pieces around  until the piece
700,00:29:58.97,00:29:58.97, that has the knife  attached to it
701,00:30:01.40,00:30:01.40, can slide through the slot.
702,00:30:03.30,00:30:03.30," Take that knife out  of the sheath,"
703,00:30:04.87,00:30:04.87, cut the rope--  that releases your last flag.
704,00:30:07.17,00:30:07.17,First tribe back to me at this platform
705,00:30:09.60,00:30:09.60,with all the flags wins immunity.
706,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,And I got to show you this immunity idol.
707,00:30:16.70,00:30:16.70,"If you have immunity, it guarantees you"
708,00:30:18.67,00:30:18.67,three more days on the island.

797,00:33:48.67,00:33:48.67,"Don't look at him, baby. Focus on you, baby."
798,00:33:50.50,00:33:50.50,Focus on you.
799,00:33:52.27,00:33:52.27,(cheering)
800,00:33:55.97,00:33:55.97,You got it. Don't worry.
801,00:33:58.10,00:33:58.10,Row! Row!

812,00:34:26.63,00:34:26.63,"Come on, you guys!"
813,00:34:32.73,00:34:32.73,Work hard!
814,00:34:34.13,00:34:34.13,We haven't won yet. Work hard!

818,00:34:45.83,00:34:45.83,(cheering)
819,00:34:49.63,00:34:49.63,Sook Jai wins immunity!
820,00:34:56.60,00:34:56.60,"Nice finish, guys."
821,00:34:58.73,00:34:58.73,"Sook Jai, nice come-from-behind."
822,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,You're going back to camp with immunity.
823,00:35:02.80,00:35:02.80,"Chuay Gahn, nice effort."
824,00:35:04.57,00:35:04.57,"Unfortunately, Tribal Council tonight,"
825,00:35:07.20,00:35:07.20,somebody will be the first person voted out.
826,00:35:09.10,00:35:09.10,-I'm so sorry. -Don't worry about it.
827,00:35:17.30,00:35:17.30,(cheering)
828,00:35:31.20,00:35:31.20,-(sobbing) -Cheer up. Cheer up.
829,00:35:36.23,00:35:36.23,We have no reason to hang our heads.
830,00:35:38.63,00:35:38.63,-Absolutely not. -No.
831,00:35:40.37,00:35:40.37,"Hey, hey, hey, hey."
832,00:35:41.93,00:35:41.93,"-Come on, you're all right. -Hey."
833,00:35:43.30,00:35:43.30,"-Everybody's gonna have a tough day... -Hey, come on."
834,00:35:44.87,00:35:44.87,-Don't worry about it. -It's not your fault.
835,00:35:46.13,00:35:46.13,"-Look, you did your best, right? -No way."
836,00:35:47.63,00:35:47.63,-Did you do your best? -Yes.
837,00:35:49.63,00:35:49.63,"All right, then, that's all you can do, all right?"
838,00:35:51.43,00:35:51.43,GHANDIA: I'm a legal secretary.  I work with facts.
839,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80, The fact is that we had
840,00:35:55.90,00:35:55.90,"a great lead, and the lead was lessened"
841,00:35:58.30,00:35:58.30,because I took too long to figure out the puzzle.
842,00:36:01.13,00:36:01.13,-We were kicking their ass. -We were. We were.
843,00:36:02.77,00:36:02.77,Those lucky bastards!
844,00:36:04.27,00:36:04.27,GHANDIA:   So now I'm feeling like...
845,00:36:05.80,00:36:05.80,that it's time for a sister to go.
846,00:36:07.83,00:36:07.83,You can vote how you want.
847,00:36:09.37,00:36:09.37,I don't want to influence you one way or the other.
848,00:36:11.13,00:36:11.13,You vote however you want to vote.
849,00:36:12.83,00:36:12.83, JOHN: Who's to say who's...  who's the most vulnerable?
850,00:36:15.03,00:36:15.03," Uh, but I know that, uh...  you know,"
851,00:36:16.93,00:36:16.93," I think everybody's  pretty much thinking,"
852,00:36:18.37,00:36:18.37," you know,  we need a strong team."
853,00:36:19.90,00:36:19.90," You know, Ghandia--  physical challenges"
854,00:36:21.07,00:36:21.07, isn't going to be her thing.
855,00:36:22.57,00:36:22.57," Obviously, mental challenges  aren't going to be her thing."
856,00:36:24.60,00:36:24.60,"Sorry, you know, Ghandia, but somebody's got to go."
857,00:36:26.80,00:36:26.80,Might as well be you.
858,00:36:28.13,00:36:28.13,"BRIAN: Hey, take another shot of water after that."
859,00:36:32.67,00:36:32.67,I'm about to throw up. Oh...
860,00:36:34.60,00:36:34.60,BRIAN: It's all right.
861,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,-(retches) -(splattering)
862,00:36:37.33,00:36:37.33,"HELEN:  Tanya, unfortunately, has..."
863,00:36:39.07,00:36:39.07," has a shot of being voted off,  and I only think that"
864,00:36:42.30,00:36:42.30, because she's had  a tough time out here.
865,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"If everybody voted her off tonight, it would be..."
866,00:36:48.33,00:36:48.33, because they feel sorry  for her.
867,00:36:49.40,00:36:49.40,"Even though you're saying,"
868,00:36:50.57,00:36:50.57,"""Don't worry,"" I mean, it is a game."
869,00:36:52.30,00:36:52.30,"It's... it's a game to me,"
870,00:36:53.83,00:36:53.83,"and I know I haven't felt well, and it's..."
871,00:36:57.13,00:36:57.13,"TANYA: I feel  a little vulnerable, you know?"
872,00:36:58.97,00:36:58.97," I have been sick, but I can't  control what my body does."
873,00:37:01.70,00:37:01.70, I'm still going to try.
874,00:37:03.47,00:37:03.47,My vote will probably be for John.
875,00:37:05.33,00:37:05.33," From the first day,  a lot of the people"
876,00:37:07.60,00:37:07.60," were upset with John  because he was saying,"
877,00:37:10.13,00:37:10.13," ""You're not rowing  hard enough,"""
878,00:37:11.57,00:37:11.57," or, ""You need to do this."""
879,00:37:12.90,00:37:12.90, A lot of people  started getting annoyed
880,00:37:14.57,00:37:14.57,because he was taking a leadership role.
881,00:37:19.27,00:37:19.27,"HELEN: Tonight, we're going  to Tribal Council."
882,00:37:20.73,00:37:20.73, I got to vote somebody out.
883,00:37:22.37,00:37:22.37, I-I... I'm sick about it. I don't want to think about it.
884,00:37:24.90,00:37:24.90,That's like voting somebody out of your family.
885,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,"PROBST: As you walk in, grab a torch, approach the flame."
886,00:37:49.30,00:37:49.30,Everybody dip your torches and get fire.
887,00:37:53.63,00:37:53.63,You do this because fire
888,00:37:55.47,00:37:55.47,represents your life in this game.
889,00:37:57.90,00:37:57.90,"As long as you have fire, you're in the game."
890,00:38:00.10,00:38:00.10,"When your fire is gone, so are you."
891,00:38:02.10,00:38:02.10,You can put your torches back in their slots.
892,00:38:04.43,00:38:04.43,Take a seat.
893,00:38:12.13,00:38:12.13,"Well, I'm sorry to say,"
894,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,welcome to your first Tribal Council.
895,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,Man.
896,00:38:18.23,00:38:18.23,"At Tribal Council, it's very simple."
897,00:38:19.77,00:38:19.77,You are held accountable for your actions on the island.
898,00:38:22.27,00:38:22.27,"Sometimes, those actions will help you;"
899,00:38:24.83,00:38:24.83,"sometimes, those actions will hurt you."
900,00:38:26.50,00:38:26.50,"Before we get to the vote, let's talk about today's challenge."
901,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,Great effort.
902,00:38:31.10,00:38:31.10,You guys could have won it.
903,00:38:32.83,00:38:32.83,You were in front for a long time.
904,00:38:34.73,00:38:34.73,"You get to this final station, Ghandia."
905,00:38:36.93,00:38:36.93,-What happened? -Um...
906,00:38:38.67,00:38:38.67,"I was working it out, and I started"
907,00:38:40.80,00:38:40.80,to get anxious when the other team's member
908,00:38:42.87,00:38:42.87,got up there and started doing it.
909,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"You know, and there was a part where I just got stuck, and I..."
910,00:38:47.37,00:38:47.37,"I just cried out that I was stuck, and, uh..."
911,00:38:51.23,00:38:51.23,"a few minutes after that, I had finished it,"
912,00:38:54.27,00:38:54.27,"but then, of course, that was too late."
913,00:38:56.23,00:38:56.23,PROBST: Do you feel responsible
914,00:38:57.70,00:38:57.70,for your tribe being here tonight?
915,00:38:59.53,00:38:59.53,Yes.
916,00:39:00.87,00:39:00.87,Because it would have never happened
917,00:39:02.47,00:39:02.47,if I would have finished my task on time.
918,00:39:04.60,00:39:04.60,"You know, it's hard enough, Clay,"
919,00:39:07.70,00:39:07.70,"to get along with people that you know,"
920,00:39:10.40,00:39:10.40,let alone seven other strangers in a high-stress situation.
921,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,How has that been?
922,00:39:16.67,00:39:16.67,"Difficult at time... I mean, it's difficult"
923,00:39:18.80,00:39:18.80,anytime you walk in and you don't know anybody.
924,00:39:21.53,00:39:21.53,"First, you got to kind of figure out"
925,00:39:23.70,00:39:23.70,who these people are and what makes them tick.
926,00:39:25.53,00:39:25.53,"And, uh, where the problem is, is when somebody steps in and..."
927,00:39:28.23,00:39:28.23,and disagrees with what goes on.
928,00:39:30.73,00:39:30.73,"Then, there's where your problem will... will come in."
929,00:39:33.23,00:39:33.23,Have you had that situation yet?
930,00:39:34.87,00:39:34.87,Uh... a li... somewhat.
931,00:39:36.67,00:39:36.67,How do you resolve that?
932,00:39:37.87,00:39:37.87,-That's why we're here. -(chuckling)
933,00:39:39.57,00:39:39.57,"We don't want to be here, but it's..."
934,00:39:41.93,00:39:41.93,-It's necessary. -...it's necessary.
935,00:39:43.10,00:39:43.10,That... that's the way the game is played.
936,00:39:44.70,00:39:44.70,"John, what's been the toughest part for you?"
937,00:39:47.57,00:39:47.57,"It really hasn't been tough yet, you know?"
938,00:39:49.20,00:39:49.20,"I'm... I'm really pleased with the teamwork,"
939,00:39:51.40,00:39:51.40,"the... the positive attitude, just the spirit."
940,00:39:53.33,00:39:53.33,We have a lot of faith on the team.
941,00:39:55.10,00:39:55.10,"And, you know, I'm..."
942,00:39:56.57,00:39:56.57,I guess I'm still waiting for it to get hard.
943,00:39:58.67,00:39:58.67,"PROBST: Brian, in your profession"
944,00:40:00.63,00:40:00.63,"as a used car salesman,"
945,00:40:02.20,00:40:02.20,"do you have an advantage, do you think,"
946,00:40:04.23,00:40:04.23,in assimilating with... with strangers?
947,00:40:06.43,00:40:06.43,"No. If you judge people, uh, by the surface"
948,00:40:09.60,00:40:09.60,"or just by on sheer looks,"
949,00:40:11.13,00:40:11.13,"then you're a very shallow person in the first place,"
950,00:40:13.23,00:40:13.23,so you got to go a lot deeper th-than that
951,00:40:15.80,00:40:15.80,"and, uh, really get to know people."
952,00:40:18.43,00:40:18.43,"And it's, uh, just... it's all about love."
953,00:40:21.50,00:40:21.50,"So it's, uh..."
954,00:40:22.87,00:40:22.87,"it's a beautiful thing once you, uh..."
955,00:40:24.47,00:40:24.47,once you get to know everyone.
956,00:40:25.83,00:40:25.83,"And, uh, not judge the book by its cover."
957,00:40:28.57,00:40:28.57,It's very important. Very important.
958,00:40:30.80,00:40:30.80,Someone always has the unfortunate distinction
959,00:40:34.27,00:40:34.27,of being the first person voted out.
960,00:40:36.33,00:40:36.33,Now we're going to just find out
961,00:40:37.70,00:40:37.70,which one of you gets that honor.
962,00:40:39.43,00:40:39.43,"It is time to vote. John, you're first."
963,00:40:56.40,00:40:56.40,"Ghandia, sweetheart, you have a killer smile."
964,00:40:59.33,00:40:59.33,God bless you. It's a tough game.
965,00:41:01.27,00:41:01.27,Have a great vacation.
966,00:41:20.33,00:41:20.33,"The only thing I can say is, it's a financial move."
967,00:41:22.60,00:41:22.60,"I think you might be a little better off than the rest of us,"
968,00:41:25.50,00:41:25.50,"so maybe you don't need the money as much as us,"
969,00:41:27.77,00:41:27.77,but glad I got to know you.
970,00:41:46.90,00:41:46.90,"John, you're an awesome man."
971,00:41:49.33,00:41:49.33,"I just felt that there was tension,"
972,00:41:51.17,00:41:51.17,"and I thought, in the long run, it would sap us of our energy,"
973,00:41:55.57,00:41:55.57,and we need to be strong all the way without the tension.
974,00:42:00.10,00:42:00.10,I'll go tally the votes.
975,00:42:09.00,00:42:09.00,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
976,00:42:10.90,00:42:10.90,The person will be asked to leave
977,00:42:12.40,00:42:12.40,the Tribal Council area immediately.
978,00:42:14.07,00:42:14.07,I'll read the votes.
979,00:42:18.50,00:42:18.50,First vote.
980,00:42:21.93,00:42:21.93,Ghandia.
981,00:42:26.37,00:42:26.37,Clay.
982,00:42:31.33,00:42:31.33,John.
983,00:42:33.13,00:42:33.13,"That's one vote John, one vote Ghandia, one vote Clay."
984,00:42:39.90,00:42:39.90,Two votes John.
985,00:42:43.60,00:42:43.60,That's three votes John.
986,00:42:48.23,00:42:48.23,"That's four votes John, and that's enough."
987,00:42:50.17,00:42:50.17,You need to bring me your torch.
988,00:42:59.07,00:42:59.07,"John, the tribe has spoken."
989,00:43:05.57,00:43:05.57,It's time for you to go.
990,00:43:18.50,00:43:18.50,"Well, it's very clear to me from you guys' reactions"
