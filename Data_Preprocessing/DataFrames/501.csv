100,00:06:11.40,00:06:11.40,This has never happened before.
101,00:06:12.67,00:06:12.67, We're separated men and women.
102,00:06:14.20,00:06:14.20,"And I had to start thinking,okay,"
103,00:06:15.87,00:06:15.87,"I got to put my game face onfor, you know, how do you..."
104,00:06:18.83,00:06:18.83,how do you jive with justall men in a group?
105,00:06:21.30,00:06:21.30,Your tribe: Sook Jai.
106,00:06:23.97,00:06:23.97,Sook Jai.

110,00:06:30.70,00:06:30.70, I thought that we were totally
111,00:06:31.97,00:06:31.97,"going to kick the men's ass,"
112,00:06:33.73,00:06:33.73,"'cause women are just betterat, like, multitasking."
113,00:06:36.60,00:06:36.60,We handle pain better.
114,00:06:37.97,00:06:37.97, We're just more logical.
115,00:06:39.77,00:06:39.77,"PROBST: Now, of course,the natural assumption"
116,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,at this point would bethat we have a tribe
117,00:06:44.83,00:06:44.83,of men and a tribe of women.
118,00:06:46.23,00:06:46.23,"That assumption, of course,would be wrong."
119,00:06:49.30,00:06:49.30,You two are going to actas tribe selectors.
120,00:06:51.70,00:06:51.70,Oh.

123,00:06:59.97,00:06:59.97,You're going to chooseone member at a time.
124,00:07:02.73,00:07:02.73,You will alternatebetween men and women.
125,00:07:05.20,00:07:05.20,And you'll begin by selectinga member of the opposite sex.
126,00:07:08.73,00:07:08.73,"Jan, you get first choice."
127,00:07:12.73,00:07:12.73,"When Jeff said that we werepicking the tribes, I really..."
128,00:07:17.13,00:07:17.13,"um, I really didkind of get scared."
129,00:07:19.27,00:07:19.27," I was scared because, um, I'm not really a leader, and I"
130,00:07:23.77,00:07:23.77,"was put in the spotlight, whichkind of frightened me."
131,00:07:26.93,00:07:26.93,PROBST:Do you know who that is?
132,00:07:28.37,00:07:28.37,-I can't remember.-Ted.

139,00:07:46.13,00:07:46.13, is ready to take on the world.
140,00:07:48.50,00:07:48.50,"Jan, you're picking a woman."

147,00:08:01.03,00:08:01.03," sort of a weak elderly lady, and I'm thinking,"

162,00:08:32.40,00:08:32.40, the younger crowd or the athletic crowd.
163,00:08:34.90,00:08:34.90,"I thought, ""Man, I really wantto be on that team."""
164,00:08:38.10,00:08:38.10,And so my heart was pumping

203,00:10:05.60,00:10:05.60,"All right, now!"
204,00:10:07.43,00:10:07.43,"(applause, whooping)"
205,00:10:08.63,00:10:08.63,ERIN: You've got to be kidding me!
206,00:10:10.37,00:10:10.37,I'm the last one?Come on!
207,00:10:12.70,00:10:12.70,I can give so muchto this tribe.
208,00:10:15.10,00:10:15.10, Being picked last is very humbling.
209,00:10:17.00,00:10:17.00, I probably needed that experience.
210,00:10:19.40,00:10:19.40,PROBST: We have our two tribes:Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn.
211,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,JAKE: I don't know what Jan was thinking
212,00:10:31.13,00:10:31.13, when she picked the people that she picked.
213,00:10:33.47,00:10:33.47,"I like to seeathletic-looking people,"
214,00:10:35.93,00:10:35.93," so I based picking a team on athleticism,"
215,00:10:39.50,00:10:39.50, and just that gleam in their eye that looks like
216,00:10:42.33,00:10:42.33, they'll be there for the duration.
217,00:10:44.27,00:10:44.27,"Sook Jai, Sook Jai,Sook Jai, Sook Jai!"
218,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,PENNY: I think Jakeis in great shape for being 60.
219,00:10:50.00,00:10:50.00, I think we probably have
220,00:10:51.23,00:10:51.23, the four best-looking guys on our tribe
221,00:10:54.10,00:10:54.10,than the other fourthat are sitting over there.
222,00:10:56.60,00:10:56.60, Absolutely.
223,00:10:58.33,00:10:58.33,The first thing we'll do--we'll build a latrine.
224,00:11:01.37,00:11:01.37,"TED: I was surprised by, uh, Jan's picks."
225,00:11:04.13,00:11:04.13,It seems like mostof the tribe members
226,00:11:06.10,00:11:06.10,"were older members, if you will."
227,00:11:08.47,00:11:08.47," The other tribe, they were extremely excited"
228,00:11:10.63,00:11:10.63, because they think they'll be able
229,00:11:12.43,00:11:12.43," to walk over us in challenges, etc."
230,00:11:15.13,00:11:15.13,They're going to be surprised.
231,00:11:16.83,00:11:16.83,"On board both boats,"
232,00:11:19.03,00:11:19.03,"identical set of supplies--very, very meager."
233,00:11:22.30,00:11:22.30,"And for food, each tribegets one small can of beans."
234,00:11:26.10,00:11:26.10,You are definitely going to haveto work together
235,00:11:28.53,00:11:28.53,to build your new world.
236,00:11:29.70,00:11:29.70,The day is already very late.
237,00:11:32.13,00:11:32.13,The weatheris very temperamental.
238,00:11:34.07,00:11:34.07,I suggest you get on your boatand get out to your camps.
239,00:11:36.57,00:11:36.57,Look for your tribe flagand the small fishing canoe.
240,00:11:40.43,00:11:40.43,Get out of here.
241,00:11:59.40,00:11:59.40,"HELEN: We figured out quickly, as a team, that we needed"
242,00:12:02.40,00:12:02.40,"to turn the boat around,"
243,00:12:03.77,00:12:03.77,and the other teamdidn't figure that out.
244,00:12:05.90,00:12:05.90," The other team is, um, quite a bit younger, and..."
245,00:12:09.03,00:12:09.03, they're anxious little kids.
246,00:12:10.27,00:12:10.27,"And they just got in the boat--paddle, paddle!"
247,00:12:11.73,00:12:11.73,"They were thinking it wasa race, and we knew it wasn't."
248,00:12:14.60,00:12:14.60,"JOHN:Okay, guys. Let's go."
249,00:12:16.83,00:12:16.83,"-Paddles in the water.-Go, Granny, go."

251,00:12:20.50,00:12:20.50,Right side. Right side.
252,00:12:22.07,00:12:22.07,JOHN: I found it interesting
253,00:12:23.60,00:12:23.60,to... to realizethat none of our team
254,00:12:26.07,00:12:26.07,understood how to paddle a boat.
255,00:12:28.40,00:12:28.40,"Okay, right side.Give us just a minute."
256,00:12:30.27,00:12:30.27,"Okay, right side."
257,00:12:32.00,00:12:32.00,"You paddle on the right,you go left;"
258,00:12:33.63,00:12:33.63,"you paddleon the left, you go right."
259,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30," I mean, we're turning in a big"

261,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17, people on the right are just powering away.
262,00:12:40.77,00:12:40.77,-Stroke! Stroke!-Dig it in.
263,00:12:42.27,00:12:42.27,-Stroke!-There we go.
264,00:12:43.47,00:12:43.47,Stroke! Stroke!
265,00:12:45.47,00:12:45.47,"JOHN: All right, right side,we're starting to turn a little."
266,00:12:47.87,00:12:47.87,"-Right side, let up.-Go a little bit easy."
267,00:12:49.77,00:12:49.77,Y'all don't have to stop.Just go easy.
268,00:12:51.70,00:12:51.70,"TANYA: On the way over here, you could see"
269,00:12:53.57,00:12:53.57, who was wanting to take leadership roles--
270,00:12:55.13,00:12:55.13, they would tell you what to do-- and...
271,00:12:57.00,00:12:57.00," and John, in particular, he wanted"
272,00:12:58.33,00:12:58.33, to get here as fast as we could.
273,00:13:00.27,00:13:00.27,"This team, you know,we had a lot of the older group,"
274,00:13:03.17,00:13:03.17,"and, um, I'm the youngestone here, and..."
275,00:13:05.67,00:13:05.67," I was hoping I would be on the other tribe, actually."
276,00:13:08.00,00:13:08.00, I got stuck with the group that I didn't really think
277,00:13:10.30,00:13:10.30,I could relate to.
278,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50,Chuay Gahn!
279,00:13:13.00,00:13:13.00,(all whooping)
280,00:13:19.87,00:13:19.87,JAKE: We didn't realize
281,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50, that we were paddling the boat backwards.
282,00:13:23.80,00:13:23.80,(laughs)I was steering the boat
283,00:13:26.63,00:13:26.63, from the foredeck.
284,00:13:32.00,00:13:32.00,"ROBB: And I'm, like, ""Our boat is backwards."""
285,00:13:33.97,00:13:33.97," And we all started laughing, and we're, like, ""Who cares?"""
286,00:13:36.47,00:13:36.47,I think the thing went fasterbackwards than it did forwards.
287,00:13:56.67,00:13:56.67,SHII ANN: In an ideal situation--
288,00:13:58.23,00:13:58.23," what should have happened is we should have landed,"

291,00:14:05.30,00:14:05.30,and started dispatching peopleto do whatever.
292,00:14:08.80,00:14:08.80,-The map!-The map.

297,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,"we all went, you know, wild."
298,00:14:21.07,00:14:21.07,I can't believeyou're climbing a mango tree.
299,00:14:23.70,00:14:23.70,Do you see a mango anywhere?
300,00:14:25.07,00:14:25.07,Do you see anything?

402,00:18:32.47,00:18:32.47,"Oh, my God. She is wild."
403,00:18:34.47,00:18:34.47,"She's crazy. I mean,"
404,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13," don't get me wrong, going skinny-dipping--"
405,00:18:38.10,00:18:38.10," everyone should do it, but..."
406,00:18:40.07,00:18:40.07,you will not see my ta-tas.
407,00:18:41.77,00:18:41.77,You look good in the moonlight.
408,00:18:43.10,00:18:43.10,"-It suits you.-Well, thank you."
409,00:18:44.77,00:18:44.77,"JAKE: After we kind of calmed down a little bit,"
410,00:18:47.53,00:18:47.53,we knew that we hadto get something--
411,00:18:49.30,00:18:49.30,"uh, some form of a shelter."
412,00:18:51.20,00:18:51.20," We built, uh, kind of a halfway shelter"
413,00:18:53.57,00:18:53.57, that we knew we were going to tear down and rebuild.
414,00:18:56.27,00:18:56.27, Nobody was proud of it.
415,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,"Location and everything sucks,"
416,00:18:59.07,00:18:59.07,"but dude,it was so spur-of-the-moment."
417,00:19:00.47,00:19:00.47,We got the entire day tomorrow.
418,00:19:01.90,00:19:01.90,Are you sure we can all fitin here?
419,00:19:03.63,00:19:03.63,"-Come on.-Good night, you guys."
420,00:19:05.13,00:19:05.13,-Good night.-Good night.
421,00:19:06.37,00:19:06.37,"Good night, dream team."
422,00:19:07.53,00:19:07.53,"""Good night, dream team?""(laughs)"
423,00:19:09.03,00:19:09.03,"Hey, where's my skateboard?"
424,00:19:10.67,00:19:10.67,(laughter)
425,00:19:25.27,00:19:25.27,"TED:Hey, don't worry about it."
426,00:19:27.83,00:19:27.83,You just got to get used tothe... your stomach and stuff's
427,00:19:30.43,00:19:30.43,got to get usedto this environment.
428,00:19:32.47,00:19:32.47,I think I'm about to be sick.
429,00:19:41.03,00:19:41.03,JOHN: Tanya got a little sick.
430,00:19:43.17,00:19:43.17,I think what it isis that she just got dehydrated.
431,00:19:46.03,00:19:46.03,I don't think I drankenough water yesterday.
432,00:19:48.00,00:19:48.00,"Just, here.Just take some. Here."
433,00:19:50.20,00:19:50.20, GHANDIA: We need to stay hydrated because water
434,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,is one of the most importantthings out here with the heat.
435,00:19:55.60,00:19:55.60, So we decided we would all go to find the water source.
436,00:19:58.90,00:19:58.90,-You ready?-Yeah. Let's do it.
437,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10,-Let's go.-Let's go.
438,00:20:03.03,00:20:03.03,"GHANDIA: We had just gone inthe water and started trekking,"
439,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00," and John, he cameto this crevice, and he's like,"
440,00:20:08.47,00:20:08.47,"""Well, let's climb up in here."""
441,00:20:10.00,00:20:10.00,"-John, let's walk. -Well, I...I can walk on the edge"
442,00:20:12.60,00:20:12.60,along the top.
443,00:20:13.97,00:20:13.97,It's actually not a bad climb.
444,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,"-Be careful, man.-Uh-huh."
445,00:20:18.50,00:20:18.50,We got you.
446,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,You straight?
447,00:20:22.37,00:20:22.37,-I'll meet you allaround the corner. -Okay.
448,00:20:24.03,00:20:24.03,"I... really,I want to see what..."
449,00:20:25.73,00:20:25.73,-what fruit treeswe have up here. -Okay.
450,00:20:27.80,00:20:27.80,And... and that sort of thing.
451,00:20:29.17,00:20:29.17,"All right, John, we're walking."
452,00:20:30.47,00:20:30.47,"Be careful, man. Be safe."
453,00:20:32.30,00:20:32.30,"JAN: We don't need to be separating like that,"
454,00:20:34.33,00:20:34.33," but some people get eager and say,"
455,00:20:36.33,00:20:36.33," ""Well, we don't need to stay."
456,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,"We want to go onand check it out."""
457,00:20:39.60,00:20:39.60,"You know, I'll... I'll laugh"
458,00:20:41.17,00:20:41.17,if we get thereand John is there before us.
459,00:20:44.00,00:20:44.00,(laughter)
460,00:20:45.90,00:20:45.90,-See that sand over there?-Yeah.
461,00:20:47.13,00:20:47.13,That's where we need to go.
462,00:20:48.63,00:20:48.63,-I think that's where we needto go-- up in the jungle. -Okay.
463,00:20:51.27,00:20:51.27,"HELEN: Well, we thought we had the map figured out,"
464,00:20:52.90,00:20:52.90," and we thought, ""Well, all right, it's dumping us off"
465,00:20:54.43,00:20:54.43,"in the middleof the jungle here."""
466,00:20:55.77,00:20:55.77,I guess we're going to haveto start scaling cliffs.
467,00:20:57.43,00:20:57.43,"There's a little path, right,and once we get..."
468,00:20:59.30,00:20:59.30,"this is just the hardest partright here, Ghandia."
469,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,Right here.
470,00:21:04.10,00:21:04.10,Hold my hand.
471,00:21:06.00,00:21:06.00,"Here, hand that to me."
472,00:21:07.13,00:21:07.13,"Just stick itin front of you, Tanya."
473,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,"-Got it, Brian?-Yeah."
474,00:21:10.03,00:21:10.03,-Got it.-You all right?
475,00:21:11.73,00:21:11.73,And we might evenrun into John.
476,00:21:13.73,00:21:13.73,"-Let's hope.-There's no way that,"
477,00:21:15.30,00:21:15.30,"if this is the water source,that we're supposed"
478,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,to be able to come up here
479,00:21:18.57,00:21:18.57,"every couple dayswith a big, huge gallon jug"
480,00:21:20.33,00:21:20.33,and fill it upand go back down again.
481,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,So I... I don't thinkwe're on the right track.
482,00:21:25.23,00:21:25.23,"No, and I reallydon't feel confident"
483,00:21:26.90,00:21:26.90,in my rock-climbing skills.
484,00:21:28.47,00:21:28.47,"GHANDIA: We came down the hill,"
485,00:21:29.93,00:21:29.93,"and then when we got back to...down to the bottom,"
486,00:21:32.20,00:21:32.20, here comes John-- he's back now.
487,00:21:34.00,00:21:34.00,"By the time I got there, I said,"
488,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,"""Well, here, let me take a lookat the map."""
489,00:21:36.60,00:21:36.60," And I looked at the map, and I'm like,"
490,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17," ""Okay, you know what? I think maybe we need"
491,00:21:39.80,00:21:39.80," to go around this other bend over here."""
492,00:21:41.40,00:21:41.40, And so Helen and I and Tanya took the boat over there.
493,00:21:45.03,00:21:45.03,Y'all find that water.I'm feeling good.
494,00:21:47.87,00:21:47.87,"HELEN: Everybody else decided they would follow,"
495,00:21:50.30,00:21:50.30," but by this time, the water had come in,"
496,00:21:53.23,00:21:53.23,so they decidedto come in swimming.
497,00:21:56.77,00:21:56.77,"-Ghandia, are you okay?-Yeah."
498,00:21:58.43,00:21:58.43,-It's deep water.-Okay.
499,00:22:04.40,00:22:04.40,"GHANDIA: So we swam,"
500,00:22:05.80,00:22:05.80,"I think, maybe...it seemed like a mile."
501,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,-You guys okay?-Yeah.
502,00:22:15.77,00:22:15.77,Water hole in jungle--wouldn't that...
503,00:22:17.57,00:22:17.57,wouldn't that be that way?
504,00:22:18.87,00:22:18.87,"Well, the jungle'sall through here,"
505,00:22:20.40,00:22:20.40,and there's a path over there.
506,00:22:21.80,00:22:21.80,"JOHN: But first, we came in, and we saw"
507,00:22:25.17,00:22:25.17," this big, ugly pool of brackish water"
508,00:22:27.13,00:22:27.13, that had been stagnant and sitting there.
509,00:22:29.30,00:22:29.30," We're like, ""Oh, my goodness."""
510,00:22:31.30,00:22:31.30,"I don't know, Helen.I don't know."
511,00:22:33.03,00:22:33.03,"HELEN: Taste it... taste it,and see if it's brackish."
512,00:22:35.57,00:22:35.57,-Hold my hand.-Yeah.
513,00:22:37.90,00:22:37.90,-Just a touch.-Here?
514,00:22:39.23,00:22:39.23,"Just... yeah, just to the lips."
515,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,"-Oh, yeah. It's definitelysalt water. -Is it?"
516,00:22:42.13,00:22:42.13,JOHN: So we ran around looking for other spots.
517,00:22:43.77,00:22:43.77," Just a few feet up the trail,"
518,00:22:45.33,00:22:45.33," there was a big, round piece of wood"
519,00:22:47.30,00:22:47.30, that indicated our water source.
520,00:22:49.37,00:22:49.37,It's clear.
521,00:22:51.57,00:22:51.57,"Give me some skin, baby."
522,00:22:53.60,00:22:53.60,That's awesome.
523,00:23:01.80,00:23:01.80,"JOHN: When they come,"
524,00:23:03.27,00:23:03.27,"I'll say, ""Come on, guys.We found the water hole."""
525,00:23:04.90,00:23:04.90,"And we'll take them back here,and we'll show them"
526,00:23:06.37,00:23:06.37,"the brackish stuffand say, you know,"
527,00:23:07.90,00:23:07.90,"""What we're going to have to dois filter it when we get back,"""
528,00:23:09.83,00:23:09.83,-and just kind of fool them.You want to do that? -Yeah.
529,00:23:11.50,00:23:11.50,-That's fine. -And just kindof... just kind of keep
530,00:23:12.90,00:23:12.90,fooling them a little bituntil they notice the tank.
531,00:23:14.30,00:23:14.30,"And they'll go, ""No way!"""
532,00:23:15.53,00:23:15.53,-And then we'll laugh it off.-Yeah.
533,00:23:16.87,00:23:16.87,GHANDIA: And when we got in eyesight
534,00:23:18.93,00:23:18.93," of John and Tanya and Helen,"
535,00:23:21.40,00:23:21.40,I was kind of wondering why
536,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,John or Helen didn't come outand get us with the canoe.
537,00:23:27.43,00:23:27.43,CLAY:Push the canoe out here!
538,00:23:30.03,00:23:30.03,Retards.
539,00:23:32.30,00:23:32.30,Y'all didn't see me lose my...?
540,00:23:34.57,00:23:34.57,We're about to freaking drownout here.
541,00:23:36.57,00:23:36.57,"GHANDIA: And then, when we got there, John decides"
542,00:23:39.07,00:23:39.07,that it would be funnyto play a joke on us.
543,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,All we can figureis that we can filter it
544,00:23:43.27,00:23:43.27,"and then boil it, huh?What do you think?"
545,00:23:46.83,00:23:46.83,TED:Yeah...
546,00:23:48.30,00:23:48.30,"JOHN: Or maybe we can, uh,take the lid off"
547,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,of that tankand get some out of there.
548,00:23:52.30,00:23:52.30,-TED: What's in there?-JOHN: Fresh water.
549,00:23:53.73,00:23:53.73,JAN: Why don't we go that way?Why can't we do that?
550,00:23:56.27,00:23:56.27,-That's our water tank.-Oh!
551,00:23:58.50,00:23:58.50,-And look at how clean it is.-Yay!
552,00:24:01.07,00:24:01.07,-Oh!-Oh...
553,00:24:04.33,00:24:04.33,GHANDIA: I was happy.
554,00:24:05.60,00:24:05.60," And I was telling him, you know,"
555,00:24:07.43,00:24:07.43,"""That was really... that wasa good joke."" (mock laughs)"
556,00:24:10.03,00:24:10.03," But then, in my mind, I'm thinking that's..."
557,00:24:11.77,00:24:11.77, it wasn't really a time to joke about that just then.
558,00:24:23.70,00:24:23.70,ERIN:What are we doing here?
559,00:24:25.53,00:24:25.53,KEN:Looks like the water hole.
560,00:24:30.00,00:24:30.00,ERIN:Oh!
561,00:24:31.30,00:24:31.30,KEN:I think we got water.
562,00:24:33.97,00:24:33.97,"-Oh, my God.-It looks pretty clear to me."
563,00:24:36.13,00:24:36.13,"That is clear,clean drinking water."
564,00:24:38.20,00:24:38.20,-(chuckling)-Yeah!
565,00:24:40.67,00:24:40.67,So we don't have to go
566,00:24:41.80,00:24:41.80,to the other end of the jungleto get it.
567,00:24:43.53,00:24:43.53,"KEN: Thankfully, the water hole we found today"
568,00:24:45.53,00:24:45.53, was very close by-- maybe 100 yards away.
569,00:24:48.07,00:24:48.07," The water looks clear, even though"
570,00:24:49.77,00:24:49.77,we're definitelygoing to have to boil it.
571,00:24:51.60,00:24:51.60,But it... it looks like it'llhelp us out.
572,00:24:55.27,00:24:55.27,"ROBB: Dude, I think...honestly, I think we can do"
573,00:24:56.97,00:24:56.97,a really good job with this.
574,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,"Dude, this is totallygoing to work."
575,00:24:59.50,00:24:59.50,"-You guys know that, right?-Yeah, that's right."
576,00:25:00.90,00:25:00.90,PENNY: We spent a lot of time building the foundation
577,00:25:03.67,00:25:03.67,for what's going to beour final shelter.
578,00:25:06.47,00:25:06.47,-This is going to be so nice.-It's going to be so nice.
579,00:25:08.87,00:25:08.87,"Oh, yeah,this is going to be cool."
580,00:25:10.43,00:25:10.43,"-We're going to have a goodtime. -It's so soft, you know?"
581,00:25:12.50,00:25:12.50,JED: My tribe's priorities right now
582,00:25:14.07,00:25:14.07,are kind of gettingout of whack.
583,00:25:16.43,00:25:16.43," Their priorities are shelter,"
584,00:25:17.83,00:25:17.83, and no one's thinking about anything else.
585,00:25:19.73,00:25:19.73," I'll mention food, and everyone's like,"
586,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23," ""No, I want a floor."" I mean, come on."
587,00:25:24.13,00:25:24.13," People are going to get really hungry,"
588,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,and we've gotto just split work up
589,00:25:27.40,00:25:27.40,or it's not going to get done.
590,00:25:32.40,00:25:32.40,"ROBB: Jed, he likes to kind ofdo, I guess, whatever he wants."
591,00:25:36.27,00:25:36.27," Like, he went fishing, which hasn't produced anything yet."
592,00:25:39.13,00:25:39.13,"But, um, we really needhis strength,"
593,00:25:40.47,00:25:40.47,"like, when it comesto building a shelter."
594,00:25:45.70,00:25:45.70,"I'm sick of chopping, dude."
595,00:25:46.90,00:25:46.90,I've been doing itever since I got here.
