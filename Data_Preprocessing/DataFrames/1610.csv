2,00:00:03.96,00:00:03.96,"On day 22, a merge brought the two tribes together."
3,00:00:07.12,00:00:07.12,">> Eat, drink, and embrace your new tribe."
4,00:00:10.50,00:00:10.50,>> JEFF: And five out of the six remaining favorites rekindled
5,00:00:13.29,00:00:13.29,their alliance. >> I'm on the same page with
6,00:00:16.00,00:00:16.00,James and Parvati and Ozzy and Amanda.
7,00:00:18.75,00:00:18.75,>> JEFF: But Parvati formed a side alliance with fans Natalie
8,00:00:22.58,00:00:22.58,and Alexis. >> I've put us in an alliance
9,00:00:25.58,00:00:25.58,without you being there. I'm in an alliance with everyone
10,00:00:28.42,00:00:28.42,on the island. I'm going to have a decision to
11,00:00:30.58,00:00:30.58,"make. >> JEFF: After the merge, Jason"
12,00:00:33.08,00:00:33.08,and Eliza were the clear targets.
13,00:00:36.00,00:00:36.00,>> I think both we annoy people. >> JEFF: So when Ozzy was beaten
14,00:00:40.12,00:00:40.12,by Jason at the immunity challenge...
15,00:00:42.42,00:00:42.42,Nice work. ...Jason gave Eliza what he
16,00:00:45.00,00:00:45.00,thought was the hidden immunity idol.
17,00:00:47.08,00:00:47.08,"And at tribal council, Eliza played it."
18,00:00:50.46,00:00:50.46,This is not a hidden immunity idol.
19,00:00:53.25,00:00:53.25,>> That means Ozzy has it. Jason found it on Exile.
20,00:00:55.21,00:00:55.21,Ozzy has the real one. >> JEFF: And she was voted
21,00:00:57.79,00:00:57.79,out... Eliza.
22,00:00:59.38,00:00:59.38,...making her the first member of the jury.
23,00:01:01.67,00:01:01.67,Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
24,00:01:11.21,00:01:11.21,">> Jason, what happened? What just happened?"
25,00:01:13.58,00:01:13.58,>> What do you mean? >> Did you give her an idol?
26,00:01:18.29,00:01:18.29,>> Who gave her an idol? >> Jason did.
27,00:01:21.08,00:01:21.08,>> That was my only shot at the game.
28,00:01:23.50,00:01:23.50,So my plan of trying to send Ozzy home failed.
29,00:01:26.58,00:01:26.58,I'm glad that Eliza played the hidden immunity idol instead of
30,00:01:30.21,00:01:30.21,myself. I would have hated to play the
31,00:01:33.00,00:01:33.00,idol and then actually go home looking like even more of a
32,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,fool. >> Ozzy found it.
33,00:01:39.62,00:01:39.62,>> It was a decoy. >> Yeah.
34,00:01:42.71,00:01:42.71,I took a lesson from Yau-Man. >> Yeah.
35,00:01:46.25,00:01:46.25,>> Eliza whipping out that phony hidden immunity idol so
36,00:01:49.92,00:01:49.92,"matter-of-factly and looking at all of us like, ""Ha!"""
37,00:01:53.08,00:01:53.08,And I'm probably like... my heart is going... for a minute I
38,00:01:57.08,00:01:57.08,"was a little bit nervous. Like, I thought Ozzy had it, but"
39,00:02:01.17,00:02:01.17,just a slim chance that she might have had it.
40,00:02:04.71,00:02:04.71,Ozzy would have been gone. The idol would have been played.
41,00:02:07.92,00:02:07.92,Might not have been such a bad thing.

44,00:03:21.21,00:03:21.21,>> Ozzy fooled me. He did a good job.
45,00:03:24.00,00:03:24.00,"I felt kind of silly, but, you know, in the end, that's not"
46,00:03:26.83,00:03:26.83,what matters. It's how far you get in the
47,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,game. And to go up against Ozzy in the
48,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,first individual immunity challenge and win let me know
49,00:03:35.08,00:03:35.08,"that, you know, Ozzy's not the only godlike competitor who can"
50,00:03:39.12,00:03:39.12,"play this game. You know, I feel like I could"
51,00:03:41.71,00:03:41.71,fare pretty well as long as I keep continuing to beat Ozzy.
52,00:03:52.67,00:03:52.67,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's"
53,00:04:05.79,00:04:05.79,challenge? >> Yeah.
54,00:04:07.46,00:04:07.46,">> JEFF: For today's challenge, you will divide into two teams"
55,00:04:09.50,00:04:09.50,"of four. On my go, one person from each"
56,00:04:12.12,00:04:12.12,team will swim out into the water and crawl through a
57,00:04:15.62,00:04:15.62,"multilevel net tunnel. When you reach the platform,"
58,00:04:19.54,00:04:19.54,"you'll study a collection of Micronesian symbols, then race"
59,00:04:23.17,00:04:23.17,back to the start. You'll then place as many of
60,00:04:25.50,00:04:25.50,those symbols as you can on your answer board in the same
61,00:04:28.92,00:04:28.92,positions as they are on the platform.
62,00:04:32.00,00:04:32.00,Then the next person goes. To make it a little more
63,00:04:35.00,00:04:35.00,"complicated, you will have extra pieces which will not match"
64,00:04:37.75,00:04:37.75,anything. Once your team thinks the board
65,00:04:40.71,00:04:40.71,"is right, let me know. If you're wrong, somebody has to"
66,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17,go out again. First team to place all their
67,00:04:47.38,00:04:47.38,symbols correctly wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
68,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,for? >> Yeah.
69,00:04:53.12,00:04:53.12,>> JEFF: The winning team of four will fly to one of the most
70,00:04:55.38,00:04:55.38,"cultural places in Micronesia, Yap."
71,00:04:58.38,00:04:58.38,"You'll enjoy a local dance, a local feast, and you will spend"
72,00:05:01.96,00:05:01.96,"the night in a traditional Micronesian bai, typically"
73,00:05:07.12,00:05:07.12,reserved for chiefs and other dignitaries.
74,00:05:10.04,00:05:10.04,>> Wow. >> JEFF: You'll return to camp
75,00:05:12.08,00:05:12.08,in the morning. Worth playing for?
76,00:05:13.75,00:05:13.75,>> Absolutely worth playing for. >> JEFF: Because we have nine
77,00:05:15.67,00:05:15.67,"people and we're dividing into two teams of four, there will be"
78,00:05:17.92,00:05:17.92,one extra person. The person not chosen will not
79,00:05:20.67,00:05:20.67,"participate in the challenge, and will instead go to Exile"
80,00:05:23.83,00:05:23.83,Island. >> Oh!
81,00:05:27.25,00:05:27.25,>> JEFF: We're going to draw for captains.
82,00:05:29.38,00:05:29.38,"We'll do a schoolyard pick. All right, Jason's a captain."
83,00:05:31.58,00:05:31.58,"Natalie's a captain. Natalie, Jason, rock, paper,"
84,00:05:34.25,00:05:34.25,scissor to see who chooses first.
85,00:05:36.29,00:05:36.29,>> On three. >> Yep.
86,00:05:38.04,00:05:38.04,">> One, two, three. >> JEFF: Jason won the rock,"
87,00:05:40.71,00:05:40.71,"paper, scissor. Jason, make your first move."
88,00:05:43.17,00:05:43.17,">> Okay, come on over, Ozzy. >> JEFF: Jason choose Ozzy."
89,00:05:47.33,00:05:47.33,"Natalie, you're up. Who do you want?"
90,00:05:49.33,00:05:49.33,">> James. >> JEFF: Jason, your pick."
91,00:05:51.71,00:05:51.71,">> Eric, come on over. >> Natalie, who is your next"
92,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,choice? >> Parvati.
93,00:05:57.17,00:05:57.17,>> JEFF: Parvati joins James and Natalie.
94,00:06:00.21,00:06:00.21,"We're down to three. Jason, your pick?"
95,00:06:02.79,00:06:02.79,">> Amanda, come on over. >> JEFF: All right, Natalie, one"
96,00:06:05.75,00:06:05.75,choice left. It's Alexis or Cirie.
97,00:06:09.21,00:06:09.21,The person you do not choose is going to Exile Island.
98,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,">> Alexis. >> JEFF: Alexis joins Natalie,"

100,00:06:18.83,00:06:18.83,">> Bye, y'all. Have fun."
101,00:06:21.17,00:06:21.17,>> JEFF: You will return to this game at the next immunity
102,00:06:22.96,00:06:22.96,"challenge. All right, we have our two teams"
103,00:06:25.50,00:06:25.50,of four. I'll give you a minute to
104,00:06:27.75,00:06:27.75,"strategize, we'll get started. Here we go."
105,00:06:31.38,00:06:31.38,For reward. Survivors ready?
106,00:06:34.25,00:06:34.25,Go! Jason and Parvati out first.
107,00:06:37.21,00:06:37.21,"Into the water, and through the net tunnel."
108,00:06:40.58,00:06:40.58,">> Go, baby, go! >> JEFF: Jason flying over it."
109,00:06:50.71,00:06:50.71,Jason in the water swimming to the platform.
110,00:06:53.33,00:06:53.33,">> Go, Parv! >> JEFF: Jason studying those"
111,00:06:58.08,00:06:58.08,symbols. Trying to remember as many as he
112,00:07:01.96,00:07:01.96,can. Parvati now on the platform.
113,00:07:05.50,00:07:05.50,">> Take your time, girl! >> JEFF: Jason heading back."
114,00:07:07.88,00:07:07.88,"Parvati heading back. If you call it and you're wrong,"
115,00:07:11.25,00:07:11.25,somebody else has got to swim out before you can make any
116,00:07:13.92,00:07:13.92,"changes. >> Let's go, let's go!"
117,00:07:16.46,00:07:16.46,>> JEFF: Jason screaming through that tunnel on the way back.

120,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,Parvati back to the answer board.
121,00:07:29.08,00:07:29.08,Not only do you have to remember the symbols you saw on the other
122,00:07:32.00,00:07:32.00,"board, you have to differentiate between the fake pieces."
123,00:07:38.96,00:07:38.96,Parvati's done. Alexis heading out.
124,00:07:42.46,00:07:42.46,Jason taking his time on that board.

134,00:08:34.33,00:08:34.33,Remember those symbols. >> JEFF: Ozzy finishes his turn.
135,00:08:36.17,00:08:36.17,"Erik now out on the course Alexis really taking her time,"
136,00:08:39.42,00:08:39.42,trying to be right. Alexis finishes her turn.

155,00:10:01.04,00:10:01.04,Bring it home for us. >> JEFF: Both teams think
156,00:10:03.17,00:10:03.17,they're close. >> Call it!
157,00:10:05.12,00:10:05.12,">> That right? >> JEFF: No, you're wrong."
158,00:10:09.04,00:10:09.04,Somebody's got to head out and figure out what's wrong.
159,00:10:12.67,00:10:12.67,">> Take out the first one, the very first boat."

161,00:10:16.54,00:10:16.54,And put the one with the light sky.

169,00:10:50.42,00:10:50.42,to board a plane. Fly correctly to Yap.
170,00:10:52.46,00:10:52.46,"You'll enjoy a little culture, a little food, get a break away"
171,00:10:55.17,00:10:55.17,from camp. Congratulations.
172,00:10:57.25,00:10:57.25,Enjoy. Head on out.

176,00:11:22.42,00:11:22.42,Yap. I'm sitting here in the copilot
177,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,seat. Hopefully I won't have to take
178,00:11:27.17,00:11:27.17,"over or anything, but, yeah, I think we're all ready here for a"
179,00:11:29.25,00:11:29.25,great adventure. >> Yap is a little island nation
180,00:11:41.83,00:11:41.83,all by itself in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
181,00:11:44.83,00:11:44.83,"And I've never even heard of Yap, but a lot of people haven't"
182,00:11:48.29,00:11:48.29,"heard of Hickney where I've grown up, so I kind of relate to"
183,00:11:51.04,00:11:51.04,that little tiny country. >> Oh!
184,00:12:02.79,00:12:02.79,">> Hello, and welcome to the village."
185,00:12:04.79,00:12:04.79,>> Hello. >> My name is Francis.
186,00:12:18.42,00:12:18.42,">> Thank you, thank you. This jungle is very primeval,"
187,00:12:23.38,00:12:23.38,and there's little stone walkways that are worn away by
188,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,thousands of feet that have walked on them.
189,00:12:29.12,00:12:29.12,"And in the middle of the jungle, there's a village."
190,00:12:35.33,00:12:35.33,">> Oh, my god! >> This village looked out of"
191,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17,time. It was almost like this village
192,00:12:40.79,00:12:40.79,had been there for millions of years.
193,00:12:43.46,00:12:43.46,"I was expecting a dinosaur to come out of the woods, kind of,"
194,00:12:46.12,00:12:46.12,"( imitates dinosaur ) >> Oh, my god."
195,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17,I can't even believe how much food is on this table.
196,00:12:50.96,00:12:50.96,">> Oh, my god. One of everything."
197,00:12:54.58,00:12:54.58,">> I'm, like, in heaven right now, pretty much."
198,00:12:57.96,00:12:57.96,>> Isn't this amazing? >> This is beer.
199,00:13:03.17,00:13:03.17,">> Thank you. >> Yes, yes."
200,00:13:15.17,00:13:15.17,">> See, that's the tree. >> Oh, they're climbing it!"
201,00:13:18.88,00:13:18.88,">> Oh, wow. >> Oh, wow."
202,00:13:21.33,00:13:21.33,I've never seen anything like this in my life.
203,00:13:23.12,00:13:23.12,">> Yeah, it's incredible. It's absolutely incredible."
204,00:13:26.29,00:13:26.29,">> Cheers, you guys. Erik, cheers."
205,00:13:29.21,00:13:29.21,">> Give it, give it! >> Oh!"
206,00:13:37.88,00:13:37.88,>> I thought it interesting that all their women were topless.
207,00:13:40.42,00:13:40.42,"I'm sitting there ready to eat my foot food, and the lunch lady"
208,00:13:42.96,00:13:42.96,"doesn't have a shirt on. Oh, my gosh."
209,00:13:45.96,00:13:45.96,It was a little culturally interesting for me.
210,00:13:49.12,00:13:49.12,"I mean, it wasn't a huge deal, but that's the most boobs I've"
211,00:13:52.21,00:13:52.21,probably seen in my whole life. >> Yeah!
212,00:13:56.67,00:13:56.67,>> ( chanting ) >> One thing that really
213,00:14:07.75,00:14:07.75,fascinated me was the tribal dance.
214,00:14:09.71,00:14:09.71,It was about some legend about their culture.
215,00:14:12.67,00:14:12.67,>> ( chanting ) >> They had all the kids in
216,00:14:18.62,00:14:18.62,"their village come, and it was choreographed beautifully."
217,00:14:20.96,00:14:20.96,And I could see that the moms and the dads were proud of their
218,00:14:23.25,00:14:23.25,"kids who were doing it, and it was really exciting."
219,00:14:25.67,00:14:25.67,It was a very powerful experience.
220,00:14:27.71,00:14:27.71,>> ( chanting ) >> Yeah!
221,00:14:32.54,00:14:32.54,>> Woo! >> That was awesome!
222,00:14:39.62,00:14:39.62,">> I really love just going places with Erik, because he has"
223,00:14:42.38,00:14:42.38,"this naive, wide-eyed sense about things."
224,00:14:46.46,00:14:46.46,Erik hasn't really traveled around too many places in the
225,00:14:49.12,00:14:49.12,world. So he's really just experiencing
226,00:14:51.67,00:14:51.67,all this stuff for the first time.
227,00:14:54.21,00:14:54.21,"And the innocence that he has, and the way he really, like,"
228,00:14:56.71,00:14:56.71,"takes things in, like, wholeheartedly, it was... it's"
229,00:14:59.17,00:14:59.17,wonderful. Damn it!
230,00:15:26.54,00:15:26.54,">> The men were chewing the betel nut, which is kind of like"
231,00:15:29.46,00:15:29.46,tobaccoish. So I was kind of hanging out
232,00:15:32.12,00:15:32.12,with them a lot. They were laughing at me when I
233,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,"did stupid stuff. But the betel nut, it relaxed me"
234,00:15:36.67,00:15:36.67,a lot. Maybe a little too much.
235,00:15:45.00,00:15:45.00,"Ah! That night, after much betel nut"
236,00:15:55.83,00:15:55.83,"and Micronesian beer, I thought, ""Okay, time to call it a night."""
237,00:16:00.50,00:16:00.50,"And then all of a sudden I had to rush up, and I pretty much"
238,00:16:03.29,00:16:03.29,tossed my cookies on the edge of the camp.
239,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,Oh! Oh!
240,00:16:09.92,00:16:09.92,Damn that betel nut! Oh!
241,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,"Beer and betel nut, not a good combination."
242,00:16:22.96,00:16:22.96,Woo! What was remarkable about that
243,00:16:26.25,00:16:26.25,"was that despite the throwing up, I really don't regret"
244,00:16:28.62,00:16:28.62,"anything. It was all worth it, and I"
245,00:16:30.75,00:16:30.75,enjoyed it thoroughly. Damn!
246,00:16:34.17,00:16:34.17,I'm going to go eat some more. Oh!
247,00:16:54.96,00:16:54.96,>> It started the most scariest thunder I've ever heard in my
248,00:16:59.88,00:16:59.88,life. Just rained all night.
249,00:17:03.50,00:17:03.50,The fire's out. Pretty cold without the fire.
250,00:17:08.54,00:17:08.54,Just not a good night. Not a good night at all.
251,00:17:20.38,00:17:20.38,There's nothing to gain by being on Exile Island.
252,00:17:24.25,00:17:24.25,"There's no idol to be found, because Ozzy has it."
253,00:17:28.75,00:17:28.75,"Ozzy's a huge competitor, and then to have the idol on top of"
254,00:17:32.42,00:17:32.42,"that, that increased his target, like, tenfold."
255,00:17:36.33,00:17:36.33,Maybe I'll just have to work on getting rid of Ozzy and his
256,00:17:39.33,00:17:39.33,idol. >> The actual gall to get up and
257,00:19:10.58,00:19:10.58,"tell somebody something, I mean, and then lay your ass back down,"
258,00:19:13.58,00:19:13.58,"that's nerve. >> Hell, yeah."
259,00:19:30.17,00:19:30.17,>> I know. >> Hi.
260,00:19:39.25,00:19:39.25,">> Tell us about it, Jason. Was it the land of milk and"
261,00:19:42.12,00:19:42.12,honey? >> Pretty much.
262,00:19:44.46,00:19:44.46,">> Hey, there he is. >> What's wrong with you all?"
263,00:19:49.12,00:19:49.12,You all look hung over. >> They had a pig.
264,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,They had lobsters. They had these mangrove crabs
265,00:19:58.42,00:19:58.42,"that had a claw, like, almost the size of my hand."
266,00:20:01.42,00:20:01.42,They had these crazy banana pancakes.
267,00:20:04.25,00:20:04.25,Four or five different kinds of chicken.
268,00:20:06.71,00:20:06.71,"One with a kind of teriyaki, one was, like, spicy, one was"
269,00:20:10.08,00:20:10.08,barbecued. >> He's like... everyone else is
270,00:20:30.12,00:20:30.12,"downplaying how good the food is, and he was like, ""It was so"
271,00:20:32.08,00:20:32.08,"delicious!"" Please, give me every mouth"
272,00:20:34.12,00:20:34.12,watering detail. >> She's really close with those
273,00:20:42.12,00:20:42.12,"girls, isn't she? >> Since she's been back since"
274,00:20:46.83,00:20:46.83,"the swap, we're not so close. >> I worry about Parvati."
275,00:20:55.58,00:20:55.58,She's put herself into an alliance with Natalie and
276,00:20:58.29,00:20:58.29,"Alexis, and I don't know these girls."
277,00:21:00.75,00:21:00.75,"I don't trust them. And Ozzy has to be careful,"
278,00:21:03.04,00:21:03.04,"because he is such a threat, and they know he has the idol."
279,00:21:06.00,00:21:06.00,"And who's to say who's to flip, who's not to flip?"
280,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,">> You know, I probably won't be around much longer unless I"
281,00:21:19.79,00:21:19.79,continue to win every single individual immunity challenge.
282,00:21:29.08,00:21:29.08,">> Yep. I want to be ready, too."
283,00:21:31.17,00:21:31.17,"It'll be life or death for me. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys!"
284,00:21:51.04,00:21:51.04,"We'll now bring in Cirie, returning from Exile Island."
285,00:22:00.71,00:22:00.71,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?"
286,00:22:03.17,00:22:03.17,>> Yeah. >> JEFF: First things first.
287,00:22:05.04,00:22:05.04,"Jason, I'll take back the immunity necklace."
288,00:22:12.46,00:22:12.46,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
289,00:22:18.21,00:22:18.21,"For today's challenge, you're going to step up on a log."
290,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,You're going to raise your hand above your head.
291,00:22:23.00,00:22:23.00,Your hand will be tethered to a bucket filled with water.

295,00:22:37.25,00:22:37.25,million bucks. We'll get started.
296,00:22:45.21,00:22:45.21,"All right, everybody is tethered in."
297,00:22:47.21,00:22:47.21,This challenge is officially on. >> Oh!
298,00:23:17.04,00:23:17.04,>> No way! >> This is usury.
299,00:23:18.88,00:23:18.88,">> There's food, I'm out. >> JEFF: You guys have been out"
300,00:23:20.79,00:23:20.79,here a long time without sugar. >> Ah!
301,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,>> JEFF: Big bowl of candy if you want to get down and give up

306,00:23:34.04,00:23:34.04,"together, you split it. >> One, two, three."
307,00:23:37.67,00:23:37.67,>> JEFF: Cirie and Erik opt out of the challenge for a bowl of
308,00:23:41.92,00:23:41.92,"candy. >> Oh, my god!"
309,00:23:44.12,00:23:44.12,You guys. >> What in the nickelodeon is
310,00:23:47.08,00:23:47.08,"going on around here? >> I'm sorry, you guys."
311,00:23:54.25,00:23:54.25,>> Must go to the happy place. >> What is it?
312,00:24:11.21,00:24:11.21,">> If it's a steak, I quit, but if it's not..."
313,00:24:14.79,00:24:14.79,>> No! >> You didn't even wait for him

315,00:24:19.54,00:24:19.54,"No, no. I hadn't even said what it was."
316,00:24:22.29,00:24:22.29,>> She doesn't get it? >> No chance.
317,00:24:25.04,00:24:25.04,You got excited. You're out.

320,00:24:36.50,00:24:36.50,Just so we're clear. If you want this chocolate chip

328,00:25:07.50,00:25:07.50,"for that long, out of the challenge."
329,00:25:13.08,00:25:13.08,Nobody interested in the chocolate chip cookie and milk?

370,00:28:58.21,00:28:58.21,I'll have to think about that for a moment.

381,00:29:54.92,00:29:54.92,somebody just made a deal that's going to cost them their spot in
382,00:29:59.46,00:29:59.46,this game. Go and sit on the bench.
383,00:30:01.96,00:30:01.96,"I'll bring you your food. >> Yay, food."
384,00:30:35.42,00:30:35.42,>> Nice work. Could you have stayed up there
385,00:30:37.29,00:30:37.29,longer? >> Probably.
386,00:30:43.17,00:30:43.17,>> I spent six and a half hours busting my butt trying to win
387,00:30:46.08,00:30:46.08,"that immunity necklace, and to just step down for some food and"
388,00:30:49.58,00:30:49.58,"people's guarantee that they're going to keep me around, you"
389,00:30:54.08,00:30:54.08,"know, I'm taking a chance here. It could be my biggest mistake"
390,00:30:57.04,00:30:57.04,"in the game of Survivor, or, you know, it could be my saving"
391,00:31:00.21,00:31:00.21,grace. >> Wow!
392,00:31:02.88,00:31:02.88,>> I want to thank you guys for making that happen at the end.
393,00:31:04.92,00:31:04.92,"Thank you so much. >> I think one of the dumbest,"
394,00:31:17.08,00:31:17.08,most naive moves in Survivor history just got played out.
395,00:31:20.71,00:31:20.71,We all guaranteed that we weren't going to vote for him.
396,00:31:23.54,00:31:23.54,"But Jason fell for one of the oldest tricks in the book, and"
397,00:31:27.04,00:31:27.04,he's going to go home. >> I think six hours up there
398,00:31:33.21,00:31:33.21,made him delirious. >> Damn fool.
399,00:31:41.42,00:31:41.42,">> This game is outwit, outplay..."
400,00:31:43.25,00:31:43.25,">> Outlast, yeah. >> I mean, unless you can think"
401,00:31:49.75,00:31:49.75,of a better plan. Otherwise he could still go on
402,00:31:51.54,00:31:51.54,"immunity rampage. >> I mean, I'm pretty sure"
403,00:31:53.88,00:31:53.88,Cirie's down. >> We all guaranteed Jason that
404,00:32:07.25,00:32:07.25,we wouldn't vote him out tonight.
405,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,"But I think Ozzy wants to vote him out anyway, which makes this"
406,00:32:12.29,00:32:12.29,"the perfect time to get rid of Ozzy and that idol, because"
407,00:32:16.25,00:32:16.25,"he'll never see it coming. Ozzy is like a huge, huge threat"
408,00:32:32.46,00:32:32.46,"in this game. So if Jason, Parvati, Natalie,"
409,00:32:37.08,00:32:37.08,"Alexis, and myself will vote Ozzy, Ozzy's gone, idol's gone,"
410,00:32:42.12,00:32:42.12,clean slate. >> I'm just going to stand here
411,00:33:01.46,00:33:01.46,for a minute. I think if I went to the final
412,00:33:05.83,00:33:05.83,"five with Ozzy, Ozzy would win this game."
413,00:33:08.71,00:33:08.71,"And I haven't been here, miserable, going through all"
414,00:33:11.67,00:33:11.67,"this crap to not win this game. >> Seriously, good job, Parvati."
415,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,>> We'd have to be idiots not to vote him out tonight.
416,00:33:20.50,00:33:20.50,">> On the other hand, I made an alliance with Ozzy, and he"
417,00:33:23.29,00:33:23.29,protected me in this game a bunch of times.
418,00:33:26.79,00:33:26.79,And Amanda has been my best friend since the beginning of
419,00:33:29.12,00:33:29.12,the game. And James has been my guy since
420,00:33:31.21,00:33:31.21,"day one. So, god, like, what do I do?"
421,00:33:51.67,00:33:51.67,">> Ozzy was kind of the one in charge, and if he's out, it's"
422,00:33:54.21,00:33:54.21,really going to shake things up. But it has to really be kept on
423,00:33:57.38,00:33:57.38,"the DL, because if Ozzy gets any sniff of it, he'll use his idol,"
424,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33,and that would not be good. >> Do we have to worry about
425,00:34:11.58,00:34:11.58,"Parvati, and Natalie, and Alexis?"
426,00:34:13.50,00:34:13.50,>> I don't know. >> You getting a bad feeling?
427,00:34:19.04,00:34:19.04,>> Yeah. >> Have you talked to her about
428,00:34:20.75,00:34:20.75,it? >> No.
429,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,>> James is worried about Parvati.
430,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,And this would be a good moment for someone to try and possibly
431,00:34:26.33,00:34:26.33,"flush the idol out, but at this point, I'm pretty confident in"
432,00:34:29.46,00:34:29.46,"my alliance. I mean, hell, this is the reason"
433,00:34:32.21,00:34:32.21,why we're favorites. We played this game before.
434,00:34:34.88,00:34:34.88,We know that once we decide something we've just got to go
435,00:34:37.96,00:34:37.96,"with it. And it's worked out so far, but"
436,00:34:40.12,00:34:40.12,we'll see. In the last moment I might just
437,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,"stuff my idol in my bag, and we'll see what happens at"
438,00:34:44.04,00:34:44.04,"tribal, and I might end up playing it just to be safe."
439,00:35:05.92,00:35:05.92,>> JEFF: We'll now bring in your jury.
440,00:35:11.42,00:35:11.42,"Eliza, voted out at the last tribal council."
441,00:35:21.42,00:35:21.42,"All right, Cirie, tell me about Exile Island."
442,00:35:23.71,00:35:23.71,Did you spend any time looking for the hidden immunity idol?
443,00:35:25.92,00:35:25.92,">> I mean, I only had two, maybe three hours of no rain the whole"
444,00:35:29.58,00:35:29.58,two days. So knowing that Ozzy already had
445,00:35:33.12,00:35:33.12,"it, why even bother? >> JEFF: Parvati, is that just a"
446,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,"known fact that everyone believes, which is Ozzy has the"
447,00:35:40.25,00:35:40.25,idol? >> Yeah.
448,00:35:43.08,00:35:43.08,">> JEFF: Ozzy, does that put a target on your back?"
449,00:35:46.67,00:35:46.67,">> I mean, of course. I mean, the idol is a huge thing"
450,00:35:49.42,00:35:49.42,in this game. >> JEFF: Let's talk about
451,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,today's challenge-- one of the craziest things I've ever seen
452,00:35:55.79,00:35:55.79,"go down. Jason, you made a very risky"
453,00:35:58.25,00:35:58.25,"move. >> You know, the odds of me"
454,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,continuing to win the immunity challenges are very slim.
455,00:36:06.21,00:36:06.21,"So I had to give something else a shot, and it's really just"
456,00:36:09.92,00:36:09.92,about crossing my fingers and hoping these people are going to
457,00:36:12.96,00:36:12.96,stick to their word. And I can only hope for the
458,00:36:16.08,00:36:16.08,"best. >> JEFF: So James, you guys made"
459,00:36:18.38,00:36:18.38,"a deal with the devil, in a sense."
460,00:36:20.71,00:36:20.71,You either stick to that deal and vote one of yourself out or
461,00:36:23.38,00:36:23.38,you renege on that deal and vote the guy out you said you
462,00:36:25.62,00:36:25.62,"wouldn't vote out. Either way, the person who gets"
463,00:36:28.04,00:36:28.04,snuffed goes to the jury. Now they're frustrated.
464,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,">> You know, just because you have gotten on everybody's"
465,00:36:34.33,00:36:34.33,nerves don't mean a donut is going to make you better.
466,00:36:36.42,00:36:36.42,You really can't expect to appease everybody over a donut.
467,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,"So if you tempt somebody with a donut, and they say, ""Oh, yeah,"
468,00:36:43.25,00:36:43.25,"sure,"" they might have just wanted a damn donut."
469,00:36:46.29,00:36:46.29,">> JEFF: So Cirie, just because the group gave their word to"
470,00:36:50.12,00:36:50.12,Jason doesn't mean the group will keep their word.
471,00:36:52.46,00:36:52.46,">> Sounds like that what he said, Jeff."
472,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,">> JEFF: Parvati, you're sitting pretty tonight."
473,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,You've got immunity. What's your take on this whole
474,00:37:01.67,00:37:01.67,"deal? >> I think it was a crazy deal,"
475,00:37:03.54,00:37:03.54,but I can kind of understand why he made the deal.
476,00:37:06.62,00:37:06.62,"And if it works out for him, then that's great for him."
477,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,"But if he made this deal and he gets voted out tonight, that's a"
478,00:37:14.71,00:37:14.71,"huge risk that he took. >> JEFF: Ozzy, if it's true that"
479,00:37:18.21,00:37:18.21,"you have the hidden immunity idol, does that give you a"
480,00:37:22.33,00:37:22.33,certain amount of comfort tonight in an uneasy situation?
481,00:37:26.62,00:37:26.62,">> A certain amount of comfort. Even then, it's a risk that I"
482,00:37:30.54,00:37:30.54,would have to take after all the votes have been cast.
483,00:37:34.00,00:37:34.00,And at that point I've got to sort of read the group.
484,00:37:36.71,00:37:36.71,"But, yeah, I do have a little bit of comfort."
485,00:37:40.00,00:37:40.00,">> JEFF: Well, based on what I'm hearing tonight, either"
486,00:37:42.88,00:37:42.88,everybody's going to go back on their word and Jason is going to
487,00:37:45.12,00:37:45.12,"go home, or somebody is going to get a big surprise."
488,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,"Let's get to it. Parvati, you have the"
489,00:37:50.42,00:37:50.42,individuality immunity necklace. You can give it to someone else
490,00:37:52.58,00:37:52.58,if you want. >> I'm going to keep it.
491,00:37:54.62,00:37:54.62,>> JEFF: You cannot vote for Parvati.
492,00:37:56.54,00:37:56.54,"Everybody else is fair game. Ozzy, you're up."
493,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,>> My vote for tonight is Ozzy. Hopefully you'll be going home
494,00:38:16.88,00:38:16.88,tonight instead of me. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the
495,00:39:14.25,00:39:14.25,votes. If anybody has the hidden
496,00:39:28.58,00:39:28.58,"immunity idol and they want to play it, now would be the time"
497,00:39:31.00,00:39:31.00,to do so. Okay.
498,00:39:44.79,00:39:44.79,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
499,00:39:47.75,00:39:47.75,The person voted out will be asked to latest tribal council
500,00:39:49.83,00:39:49.83,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
501,00:39:55.38,00:39:55.38,"First vote, Jason. Jason."
502,00:40:02.96,00:40:02.96,Two votes Jason. Ozzy.
503,00:40:07.79,00:40:07.79,"Two votes Jason, one vote Ozzy. Jason."
504,00:40:14.50,00:40:14.50,"Three votes Jason, one vote Ozzy."
505,00:40:19.71,00:40:19.71,"Jason. That's four votes Jason, one"
506,00:40:22.25,00:40:22.25,vote Ozzy. Ozzy.
507,00:40:30.54,00:40:30.54,"Four votes Jason, two votes Ozzy."
508,00:40:36.79,00:40:36.79,"Ozzy. That's four votes Jason, three"
509,00:40:39.00,00:40:39.00,votes Ozzy. Ozzy.
510,00:40:46.00,00:40:46.00,"We're tied. Four votes Jason, four votes"
511,00:40:48.08,00:40:48.08,Ozzy. One vote left.
512,00:40:59.25,00:40:59.25,Tenth person voted out of Survivor: Fans Versus
513,00:41:01.58,00:41:01.58,"Favorites, and the second member of our jury, Ozzy."
514,00:41:04.08,00:41:04.08,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Thanks, guys."
515,00:41:21.00,00:41:21.00,">> JEFF: Ozzy, the tribe has spoken."
516,00:41:28.08,00:41:28.08,"Time for you to go. Well, that was a very big"
517,00:41:43.25,00:41:43.25,blindside. And that makes things very
518,00:41:45.71,00:41:45.71,unpredictable. Grab your torches.
519,00:41:48.21,00:41:48.21,Head back to camp. Good night.
