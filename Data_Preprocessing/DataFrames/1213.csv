227,00:14:56.42,00:14:56.42,"talk to her and give her a hug,and everybody else did."
228,00:15:00.54,00:15:00.54,That really sucked.Maybe this is Terry's head
229,00:15:06.92,00:15:06.92,right now.It's all good.
230,00:15:10.12,00:15:10.12,"He'll get his.Terry, he's out for me."

233,00:15:21.33,00:15:21.33,And you know what?I don't care.

237,00:15:30.17,00:15:30.17,anybody.This is fabulous.

243,00:15:48.96,00:15:48.96,>> Coming back to camp with H.B.was kind of funny for me
244,00:15:52.54,00:15:52.54,because I knew he didn't knowwhat to expect.
245,00:15:57.17,00:15:57.17,>> Yeah.But that's okay.
246,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,">> How's it feel to see her,man?"
247,00:16:01.38,00:16:01.38,This is our reality.>> I think it was shock for
248,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,H.B. to see how primitive welive.
249,00:16:08.42,00:16:08.42,">> What is that?>> Oh, these is snail butts."

253,00:16:17.21,00:16:17.21,>> It's called chum in thewater.
254,00:16:18.42,00:16:18.42,">> Oh, okay. Hmm.>> So, like, you see a fire like"
255,00:16:20.83,00:16:20.83,"that, that means there's tons ofembers."
256,00:16:22.83,00:16:22.83,You kind of try to make ateepee.
257,00:16:24.25,00:16:24.25,You want to have a lot of airunder the sticks.
258,00:16:26.54,00:16:26.54,>> Okay.(laughter)
259,00:16:31.17,00:16:31.17,Man down! Man down!>> We never made fire.
260,00:16:34.04,00:16:34.04,We ain't never been camping.H.B. is just like me.
261,00:16:36.42,00:16:36.42,He's never been anywhere.He's a couch potato.
262,00:16:39.75,00:16:39.75,">> What you going to do withthat, drink it?"
263,00:16:41.83,00:16:41.83,">> Yeah, that's how we do it.>> That's water."
264,00:16:43.71,00:16:43.71,(laughs)>> Oh...

268,00:16:53.88,00:16:53.88,feet in or something.Wow.
269,00:16:56.04,00:16:56.04,"(laughter)>> Seeing H.B. here, green, not"
270,00:16:59.71,00:16:59.71,"really knowing anything, ithelped me a little bit to"
271,00:17:02.50,00:17:02.50,appreciate how far I've come.It almost makes me feel like I
272,00:17:05.96,00:17:05.96,kind of underestimated myselffor 35 years.
273,00:17:10.29,00:17:10.29,"And now it's like, ""Damn, youcan do anything!"""
274,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,>> Oh!>> Three types of ice cream.
275,00:17:23.42,00:17:23.42,">> Dude, eggs!>> Vanilla, chocolate, and"
276,00:17:27.12,00:17:27.12,"strawberry.>> And milk, pancake mix."
277,00:17:29.29,00:17:29.29,(gasping)>> What is this?
278,00:17:30.96,00:17:30.96,>> Is that a cerveza?>> We went to this beautiful
279,00:17:33.29,00:17:33.29,"house here in Panama.In the kitchen, just sitting"
280,00:17:36.79,00:17:36.79,there were four different kindsof pizza.
281,00:17:40.04,00:17:40.04,"Two bottles of white wine, twobottles of champagne, a 12-pack"
282,00:17:42.71,00:17:42.71,"of beer.>> Oh, my God!"
283,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,Beer!(gasping)
284,00:17:46.58,00:17:46.58,I just want to eat it raw.There had to have been about
285,00:17:49.46,00:17:49.46,three pounds of bacon.All kinds of snacks.
286,00:17:51.79,00:17:51.79,Pretty much as much as youwanted.
287,00:17:53.96,00:17:53.96,It was all there.>> Look at this!
288,00:17:56.71,00:17:56.71,>> This is how I was in 1978.>> I was really surprised at
289,00:18:00.92,00:18:00.92,the condition that Terry was in.I almost gasped.
290,00:18:05.00,00:18:05.00,I've never seen him soemaciated and so worn out.
291,00:18:08.54,00:18:08.54,"Oh, I can't wait to get thatbeard off him, and get him back"
292,00:18:11.75,00:18:11.75,"to his hot-looking studly self.>> Day one, each tribe is on"
293,00:18:16.79,00:18:16.79,"its own island, okay?>> Oh, that's cool."
294,00:18:19.08,00:18:19.08,">> We get there, and, dude, I'mfreaking out."
295,00:18:22.88,00:18:22.88,If I could have chosen onereward and lost the rest of
296,00:18:25.21,00:18:25.21,"them, I've got my son on anovernight with all the food I"
297,00:18:28.38,00:18:28.38,"could ever want.By day six, I'm out of my mind."
298,00:18:31.92,00:18:31.92,I'm ready to quit.I don't because I think about
299,00:18:34.67,00:18:34.67,"you, and I think about how youwould have killed me if I would"
300,00:18:37.50,00:18:37.50,"have quit.You know, my son would have"
301,00:18:39.29,00:18:39.29,missed out on this amazingexperience and I'm so grateful
302,00:18:42.92,00:18:42.92,I didn't quit.>> This is what Exile Island is
303,00:18:49.92,00:18:49.92,all about and the hiddenimmunity idol.
304,00:18:52.88,00:18:52.88,It's a shrunken head.I'll try to unflatten it a
305,00:18:56.08,00:18:56.08,little bit.>> That's a good thing to have.
306,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,>> It is a very good thing tohave.
307,00:19:01.33,00:19:01.33,We started talking about thegame and the fact that my wife
308,00:19:04.08,00:19:04.08,is such a perceptive person andgreat at strategizing.
309,00:19:08.33,00:19:08.33,Immediately she just investedher whole mind into what I was
310,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,going through and interjectedherself into the game.
311,00:19:17.67,00:19:17.67,>> I'm starting to feel likeit's going to end up being all
312,00:19:20.54,00:19:20.54,men at the end.>> We're going to take out Aras.
313,00:19:23.50,00:19:23.50,"Me and Cirie, when it gets tothe four probably."
314,00:19:26.04,00:19:26.04,>> But Danielle is gone.>> She knows she's done.
315,00:19:28.00,00:19:28.00,">> I tell you what, if I wereher..."
316,00:19:30.08,00:19:30.08,>> I'd look for the idol.>> But the idol is in his bag
317,00:19:32.79,00:19:32.79,that's in your bedroom rightnow.
318,00:19:34.33,00:19:34.33,">> He hasn't told me, I'mserious."
319,00:19:36.17,00:19:36.17,">> You know, the thing that wasreally weird is that Terry's"
320,00:19:39.46,00:19:39.46,"wife, Tricia, is morecompetitive than Terry."
321,00:19:42.46,00:19:42.46,So she was the one that wantedto talk about strategy.
322,00:19:45.83,00:19:45.83,"What a lovely woman, butunbelievably competitive."
323,00:19:53.08,00:19:53.08,It's been hard out here withoutyou.
324,00:19:59.04,00:19:59.04,>> I think my dad's doingreally well in the game 'cause
325,00:20:01.83,00:20:01.83,he knows how to play the game.He's really smart and athletic.
326,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,He's like a brother to me morethan a father.
327,00:20:08.17,00:20:08.17,"We do everything together.And he's like a kid and he,"
328,00:20:10.62,00:20:10.62,"like, he does fun things with meand stuff, so I really missed"
329,00:20:13.67,00:20:13.67,him.>> I love you.
330,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,">> I love you, too, Dad.You okay?"
331,00:20:19.12,00:20:19.12,">> I'm so good.I just remember him saying, you"

338,00:20:42.21,00:20:42.21,"able to sleep with my wife wasjust a warm, warm feeling."

378,00:23:22.88,00:23:22.88,The choices were so clear to me.>> When Terry and Shane returned
379,00:23:27.12,00:23:27.12,"from their reward, Terry waskind of explaining his reasoning"
380,00:23:31.58,00:23:31.58,for delegating the time the wayhe did.
381,00:23:37.79,00:23:37.79,">> Terry, just to let you know,24 or not 24, man, everybody out"
382,00:23:42.42,00:23:42.42,here wanted to see their familymembers.
383,00:23:44.12,00:23:44.12,"Just as bad as you wanted to seeTrish, I wanted to spend the"
384,00:23:46.17,00:23:46.17,"night with my mom, and to, like,think, ""Well, it's just a mom,"""
385,00:23:49.25,00:23:49.25,that rubs me the wrong way whenyou say that.
386,00:23:51.46,00:23:51.46,">> When you get married, in myviewpoint, there's no choice."

389,00:24:00.54,00:24:00.54,"Congratulations, you got to bewith your wife."
390,00:24:03.17,00:24:03.17,"I didn't get to be with my mom,so have a little bit of sympathy"
391,00:24:06.71,00:24:06.71,"and understanding.Dude, 33 days, man."
392,00:24:09.96,00:24:09.96,You know?>> Mm-hmm.
393,00:24:11.96,00:24:11.96,>> And that is my rock.Everyone's got their rock...
394,00:24:14.17,00:24:14.17,>> Right.>> ...and what you're saying is
395,00:24:16.04,00:24:16.04,"""Well, that rock is moreimportant than that rock."""
396,00:24:18.62,00:24:18.62,My mom is huge for me.>> Here I have some 24-year-old
397,00:24:22.29,00:24:22.29,"kid lecturing me-- ""My mom is myrock and she means as much to me"
398,00:24:27.54,00:24:27.54,"as your wife means to you.""I like the fact that Aras came"
399,00:24:31.25,00:24:31.25,unglued.It showed a part of him that I
400,00:24:34.67,00:24:34.67,hadn't seen and maybe a littlecrack that I can take advantage
401,00:24:37.71,00:24:37.71,"of.When you have a wife, you'll"
402,00:24:39.75,00:24:39.75,"know this.When it happens for you, it will"
403,00:24:42.00,00:24:42.00,happen.>> The least that I would expect
404,00:24:44.46,00:24:44.46,from a 46-year-old man who talksabout his age over a 24-year-old
405,00:24:48.42,00:24:48.42,all the time is respect.That doesn't register with
406,00:24:51.21,00:24:51.21,Terry.But what he's doing is he's
407,00:24:53.17,00:24:53.17,"feeding my fire, and the more hedoes it, the more I want to beat"
408,00:24:56.79,00:24:56.79,"him.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
409,00:25:12.71,00:25:12.71,We'll now bring in Danielle fromExile Island.

419,00:25:54.04,00:25:54.04,going to require balance and asteady hand.
420,00:25:57.04,00:25:57.04,You are each going to stand on avery small perch at the top of a

425,00:26:14.04,00:26:14.04,"When the flag is high enough foryou to reach, grab it."
426,00:26:17.04,00:26:17.04,"First person to raise their flagover their head wins immunity,"
427,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,guaranteed a spot in the finalfour.
428,00:26:23.33,00:26:23.33,That is a one-in-four shot forthe million bucks.
429,00:26:26.96,00:26:26.96,One big rule: your feet are onthe perch.
430,00:26:30.54,00:26:30.54,"Your butt, your knees cannottouch the perch."

446,00:27:41.12,00:27:41.12,Terry's flag moving up quickly.Danielle's moving up.
447,00:27:46.42,00:27:46.42,Cirie surprising herself 20 feetup in the air.

484,00:30:10.96,00:30:10.96,>> Hoo-ee!>> That was fun.
485,00:30:16.04,00:30:16.04,Winning the immunity challengetoday was huge because it
486,00:30:19.46,00:30:19.46,"doesn't just win me the four, itvaults me into the final three."
487,00:30:23.00,00:30:23.00,"I have the hidden immunity idol,I don't even have to show up for"
488,00:30:26.83,00:30:26.83,the next immunity challenge.What a relief.
489,00:30:29.71,00:30:29.71,"I've had the hugest target on myback, now the pressure is off."
490,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,>> I think she's depressed'cause she knows she's next.
491,00:30:44.62,00:30:44.62,"The plan is for me, Aras, andCirie to take out Danielle"
492,00:30:47.88,00:30:47.88,tonight.And I'm in a great space.
493,00:30:49.92,00:30:49.92,I've set myself up so that I'msafe and I feel like things are
494,00:30:53.08,00:30:53.08,going to be solid.>> After what happened at
495,00:31:01.54,00:31:01.54,"Tribal Council the other night,Danielle, you know, she blew me"
496,00:31:04.58,00:31:04.58,off so I wouldn't feel too badsending her off.
497,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,"And from what I know, she'sgoing anyway."
498,00:31:14.17,00:31:14.17,">> My guess is it's going to godown that way, yes."
499,00:31:17.92,00:31:17.92,>> I would love to take Shaneto the final two.
500,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,"Not that he doesn't work, butmy case speaks for itself."
501,00:31:23.38,00:31:23.38,Going out fishing for peopleand cleaning up the camp and
502,00:31:26.08,00:31:26.08,collecting firewood andbuilding fires and teaching
503,00:31:28.92,00:31:28.92,people stuff.With a huge target on my back
504,00:31:31.21,00:31:31.21,"and winning the challenges,that I think would be a"
505,00:31:33.08,00:31:33.08,no-brainer even for a heavilyloyal Casaya jury.
506,00:31:46.21,00:31:46.21,>> Shane thinks I'm going home.It's so funny how he thinks he
507,00:31:51.08,00:31:51.08,"knows what's going on and, like,he's controlling everything."
508,00:31:54.42,00:31:54.42,He doesn't know anything.>> I was in an alliance with
509,00:31:58.67,00:31:58.67,"Shane, but I found out hewanted to take Courtney to the"
510,00:32:01.12,00:32:01.12,final two and so that prettymuch puts me off the hook.
511,00:32:04.21,00:32:04.21,I no longer feel any obligation.>> Yeah?
512,00:32:08.08,00:32:08.08,>> ...and she's good.>> I've done a really good job
513,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,of setting Shane up for asituation like this.
514,00:32:13.04,00:32:13.04,Shane thinks I'm his puppy dog.He thinks he can tell me to do
515,00:32:15.62,00:32:15.62,"this and I'll do it because, upuntil this point, I have."
516,00:32:18.67,00:32:18.67,Which really makes it easyfor me to do things pretty
517,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,inconspicuously.>> I know that Shane is looking
518,00:32:29.42,00:32:29.42,"to get rid of me, I'm lookingto get rid of him."
519,00:32:31.50,00:32:31.50,"Terry's out for me, he's pissedoff, but I have a strong bond"
520,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,with Aras and Cirie.Cirie especially.
521,00:32:42.04,00:32:42.04,"I just trust Cirie with my life.Like, I really, really do."
522,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,It's so key in this game to haveone person at least that you can
523,00:32:48.92,00:32:48.92,trust.So I'm pretty confident right
524,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,now with my alliance.>> This one is going to go
525,00:32:59.00,00:32:59.00,Danielle.>> Right.
526,00:33:00.58,00:33:00.58,>> And then the next one we'llgo Aras.
527,00:33:03.17,00:33:03.17,"But we can't look like we'rebetraying Aras, because then"
528,00:33:05.25,00:33:05.25,he'll remember that on the jury.>> Right.
529,00:33:07.79,00:33:07.79,">> And you're straight, you feelgood, and you're 100% with me?"
530,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,>> 100%.No problem.
531,00:33:12.33,00:33:12.33,">> You, Danielle and Arasaren't ... me, correct?"
532,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,">> No. No, no, no, no, no.>> All right."
533,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,I feel good.I think we're probably pretty
534,00:33:19.08,00:33:19.08,good to the three.>> Yes.
535,00:33:21.79,00:33:21.79,"Shane thinks that me, him andAras are going to vote for"
536,00:33:25.33,00:33:25.33,"Danielle when, in all actuality,Aras and Danielle are going to"
537,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,vote for Shane.Aras and Danielle-- those are
538,00:33:33.08,00:33:33.08,the two people I've had thelongest alliance with.
539,00:33:37.04,00:33:37.04,"At the same time, this is stilla game and you have to look at"
540,00:33:41.29,00:33:41.29,"it logically, because I thinkDanielle will be able to beat"
541,00:33:44.88,00:33:44.88,me in the final two.Courtney didn't hold true to
542,00:33:47.17,00:33:47.17,"Danielle's friendship, and Ithink Bruce kind of had a love"
543,00:33:51.54,00:33:51.54,"affair with Danielle, and Idon't know if her and Austin"
544,00:33:56.17,00:33:56.17,bonded at Exile Island whenthey almost died.
545,00:33:59.04,00:33:59.04,So Danielle is a threat.>> I think I've set myself up so
546,00:34:05.79,00:34:05.79,"that I'm safe, and I feel like,at this point, I could beat"
547,00:34:10.04,00:34:10.04,anybody.I feel like I could.
548,00:34:14.92,00:34:14.92,"I mean, I feel comfortable, ascomfortable as you can feel out"
549,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,here.(laughter)
550,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,"Like, am I going tonight?Just let me know if I'm going"
551,00:34:24.25,00:34:24.25,"tonight.>> I love Aras, but I'm going"
552,00:34:32.38,00:34:32.38,"to do everything, everythingthat I can do to get myself"
553,00:34:37.67,00:34:37.67,further in the game.So it is safe to say that
554,00:34:40.92,00:34:40.92,somebody's going to besurprised tonight.
555,00:34:43.29,00:34:43.29,"There's going to be hugefireworks, bigger than the"
556,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,Fourth of July.(laughing)
557,00:35:03.96,00:35:03.96,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe members of our jury.
