37,00:01:37.25,00:01:37.25,"going, believe that. (Courtney whistling)"

51,00:03:39.08,00:03:39.08,"knowing, Cirie, Danielle and Aras voted Courtney out, so I"
52,00:03:45.00,00:03:45.00,was shocked. >> Coming back from Tribal was
53,00:04:00.33,00:04:00.33,a little bit uncomfortable because Shane wanted to go to
54,00:04:05.58,00:04:05.58,"the final two with Courtney. So to reassure Shane, Aras and"
55,00:04:09.29,00:04:09.29,I came up with the story that we couldn't tell him we decided
56,00:04:13.50,00:04:13.50,"to vote Courtney because we didn't have time, we were"
57,00:04:15.21,00:04:15.21,leaving for Tribal and he was up in no-man's-land.
58,00:04:28.08,00:04:28.08,>> Right. >> I think it would have been
59,00:04:33.21,00:04:33.21,"easiest to take Courtney to the two, but Cirie assured me that"
60,00:04:37.12,00:04:37.12,"our alliance is still good. So there's five of us left now,"
61,00:04:40.71,00:04:40.71,"Danielle goes next, and then we're in the final four."
62,00:04:44.21,00:04:44.21,"Man, it's nice to not have that moron here running her mouth."

64,00:04:50.25,00:04:50.25,>> I'm just so happy that chick's gone.
65,00:05:17.75,00:05:17.75,>> Last night was the fifth failure for me in trying to get
66,00:05:21.04,00:05:21.04,"numbers on my side. Danielle and myself, we were"
67,00:05:24.92,00:05:24.92,going to take Courtney to the final three.
68,00:05:27.08,00:05:27.08,"We shook hands on it, we looked each other in the eye, and I"
69,00:05:29.50,00:05:29.50,"was lied to. So as far as I'm concerned, if"
70,00:05:32.92,00:05:32.92,"Danielle's the next on the chopping block, that's fine with"
71,00:05:34.96,00:05:34.96,me. Not my problem anymore.

192,00:12:24.88,00:12:24.88,person will be sent to Exile Island.
193,00:12:28.25,00:12:28.25,So the first decision I need is who is the first loved one that
194,00:12:32.08,00:12:32.08,is going to join their survivor on the overnight stay.
195,00:12:34.50,00:12:34.50,">> Myself and Trish. >> PROBST: Trish, come on over,"
196,00:12:36.96,00:12:36.96,give your man a hug. Okay.
197,00:12:43.42,00:12:43.42,"Next decision, who's the second loved one that is going to join"
198,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,"you on the overnight stay? >> Boston, Shane."
199,00:12:54.46,00:12:54.46,">> Oh, God, God... Oh, my God."
200,00:13:02.92,00:13:02.92,">> PROBST: Now, the next decision, which loved one gets"
201,00:13:05.46,00:13:05.46,the experience of going back to camp?
202,00:13:10.54,00:13:10.54,">> H.B., you're up, hubby. >> Oh!"
203,00:13:17.75,00:13:17.75,"Hi, baby. >> PROBST: All right, Terry,"
204,00:13:24.92,00:13:24.92,toughest decision now. Two people left.
205,00:13:27.38,00:13:27.38,Both their loved ones are here. Who's getting the hug?
206,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,>> I'm going to send Aras back to camp tonight.
207,00:13:35.04,00:13:35.04,>> Oh. >> So Aras gets the hug.
208,00:13:38.33,00:13:38.33,">> Aras, come meet your mom. Get some love."
209,00:13:42.46,00:13:42.46,>> I'm so proud of you. >> When I get home...
210,00:13:44.54,00:13:44.54,>> Yeah? >> Will you please on the table
211,00:13:46.54,00:13:46.54,"have, like, five dinners? >> Everything."
212,00:13:48.71,00:13:48.71,I'll just make everything you want.
213,00:13:51.04,00:13:51.04,"Oh, my God. >> I love you."
214,00:13:54.96,00:13:54.96,">> PROBST: Danielle, Denise, I'm sorry that this is as good as it"
215,00:13:58.04,00:13:58.04,"gets. Hopefully, it was enough,"
216,00:14:00.04,00:14:00.04,"Danielle, for you to be able to see your mom."
217,00:14:02.46,00:14:02.46,">> I love you so much. And we all love you so much, the"
218,00:14:05.12,00:14:05.12,whole family and Pugsy. We miss you so much.
219,00:14:08.79,00:14:08.79,>> Give everybody a big kiss for me when you get home.
220,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,">> I'm so proud of you. >> Mom, you're making me cry."
221,00:14:13.21,00:14:13.21,Stop. >> Be strong.
222,00:14:15.29,00:14:15.29,>> I will. She's so cute.
223,00:14:17.88,00:14:17.88,"I love her. >> PROBST: All right, Danielle,"
224,00:14:20.04,00:14:20.04,Exile Island awaits. The boat will pick you up.
225,00:14:26.75,00:14:26.75,"Okay, Aras, Cirie, H.B., Shane, Boston, Trish, Terry, head on"
226,00:14:32.08,00:14:32.08,out. >> I was so disappointed to have
227,00:14:53.38,00:14:53.38,"my mother, like, five feet in front of me and not be able to"
228,00:14:56.42,00:14:56.42,"talk to her and give her a hug, and everybody else did."
229,00:15:00.54,00:15:00.54,That really sucked. Maybe this is Terry's head
230,00:15:06.92,00:15:06.92,right now. It's all good.
231,00:15:10.12,00:15:10.12,"He'll get his. Terry, he's out for me."
232,00:15:15.04,00:15:15.04,He's pissed off because I basically ruined his strategy
233,00:15:18.54,00:15:18.54,plan to take Courtney to the final two.
234,00:15:21.33,00:15:21.33,And you know what? I don't care.
235,00:15:22.92,00:15:22.92,"I was really pissed that I couldn't see my mom, but at the"
236,00:15:25.50,00:15:25.50,same time I'm not going to sit and cry about it.
237,00:15:27.83,00:15:27.83,And how do you like that? I don't have to share this with
238,00:15:30.17,00:15:30.17,anybody. This is fabulous.
239,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,>> Yeah? >> Yeah.
240,00:15:42.08,00:15:42.08,">> Were they good? >> Mm-hmm, when we was hungry"
241,00:15:44.04,00:15:44.04,it was. >> Yeah?
242,00:15:45.58,00:15:45.58,>> Why are you bringing the stuff in here?
243,00:15:47.12,00:15:47.12,"This is where we sleep at. >> Oh, yeah?"
244,00:15:48.96,00:15:48.96,>> Coming back to camp with H.B. was kind of funny for me
245,00:15:52.54,00:15:52.54,because I knew he didn't know what to expect.
246,00:15:57.17,00:15:57.17,>> Yeah. But that's okay.
247,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,">> How's it feel to see her, man?"
248,00:16:01.38,00:16:01.38,This is our reality. >> I think it was shock for
249,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,H.B. to see how primitive we live.
250,00:16:08.42,00:16:08.42,">> What is that? >> Oh, these is snail butts."
251,00:16:11.00,00:16:11.00,">> Oh, snail who? >> Butts."
252,00:16:12.88,00:16:12.88,>> Butts? >> Like the guts or something.
253,00:16:14.62,00:16:14.62,"I use it to attract the fish. >> Oh, okay, good."
254,00:16:17.21,00:16:17.21,>> It's called chum in the water.
255,00:16:18.42,00:16:18.42,">> Oh, okay. Hmm. >> So, like, you see a fire like"
256,00:16:20.83,00:16:20.83,"that, that means there's tons of embers."
257,00:16:22.83,00:16:22.83,You kind of try to make a teepee.
258,00:16:24.25,00:16:24.25,You want to have a lot of air under the sticks.
259,00:16:26.54,00:16:26.54,>> Okay. (laughter)
260,00:16:31.17,00:16:31.17,Man down! Man down! >> We never made fire.
261,00:16:34.04,00:16:34.04,We ain't never been camping. H.B. is just like me.
262,00:16:36.42,00:16:36.42,He's never been anywhere. He's a couch potato.
263,00:16:39.75,00:16:39.75,">> What you going to do with that, drink it?"
264,00:16:41.83,00:16:41.83,">> Yeah, that's how we do it. >> That's water."
265,00:16:43.71,00:16:43.71,(laughs) >> Oh...
266,00:16:46.46,00:16:46.46,With the dirt and stuff in it? >> It's good for you.
267,00:16:49.12,00:16:49.12,(laughs) >> Okay.
268,00:16:51.46,00:16:51.46,"I thought that was, like, a basin that y'all wash y'all"
269,00:16:53.88,00:16:53.88,feet in or something. Wow.
270,00:16:56.04,00:16:56.04,"(laughter) >> Seeing H.B. here, green, not"
271,00:16:59.71,00:16:59.71,"really knowing anything, it helped me a little bit to"
272,00:17:02.50,00:17:02.50,appreciate how far I've come. It almost makes me feel like I
273,00:17:05.96,00:17:05.96,kind of underestimated myself for 35 years.
274,00:17:10.29,00:17:10.29,"And now it's like, ""Damn, you can do anything!"""
275,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,>> Oh! >> Three types of ice cream.
276,00:17:23.42,00:17:23.42,">> Dude, eggs! >> Vanilla, chocolate, and"
277,00:17:27.12,00:17:27.12,"strawberry. >> And milk, pancake mix."
278,00:17:29.29,00:17:29.29,(gasping) >> What is this?
279,00:17:30.96,00:17:30.96,>> Is that a cerveza? >> We went to this beautiful
280,00:17:33.29,00:17:33.29,"house here in Panama. In the kitchen, just sitting"
281,00:17:36.79,00:17:36.79,there were four different kinds of pizza.
282,00:17:40.04,00:17:40.04,"Two bottles of white wine, two bottles of champagne, a 12-pack"
283,00:17:42.71,00:17:42.71,"of beer. >> Oh, my God!"
284,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,Beer! (gasping)
285,00:17:46.58,00:17:46.58,I just want to eat it raw. There had to have been about
286,00:17:49.46,00:17:49.46,three pounds of bacon. All kinds of snacks.
287,00:17:51.79,00:17:51.79,Pretty much as much as you wanted.
288,00:17:53.96,00:17:53.96,It was all there. >> Look at this!
289,00:17:56.71,00:17:56.71,>> This is how I was in 1978. >> I was really surprised at
290,00:18:00.92,00:18:00.92,the condition that Terry was in. I almost gasped.
291,00:18:05.00,00:18:05.00,I've never seen him so emaciated and so worn out.
292,00:18:08.54,00:18:08.54,"Oh, I can't wait to get that beard off him, and get him back"
293,00:18:11.75,00:18:11.75,"to his hot-looking studly self. >> Day one, each tribe is on"
294,00:18:16.79,00:18:16.79,"its own island, okay? >> Oh, that's cool."
295,00:18:19.08,00:18:19.08,">> We get there, and, dude, I'm freaking out."
296,00:18:22.88,00:18:22.88,If I could have chosen one reward and lost the rest of
297,00:18:25.21,00:18:25.21,"them, I've got my son on an overnight with all the food I"
298,00:18:28.38,00:18:28.38,"could ever want. By day six, I'm out of my mind."
299,00:18:31.92,00:18:31.92,I'm ready to quit. I don't because I think about
300,00:18:34.67,00:18:34.67,"you, and I think about how you would have killed me if I would"
301,00:18:37.50,00:18:37.50,"have quit. You know, my son would have"
302,00:18:39.29,00:18:39.29,missed out on this amazing experience and I'm so grateful
303,00:18:42.92,00:18:42.92,I didn't quit. >> This is what Exile Island is
304,00:18:49.92,00:18:49.92,all about and the hidden immunity idol.
305,00:18:52.88,00:18:52.88,It's a shrunken head. I'll try to unflatten it a
306,00:18:56.08,00:18:56.08,little bit. >> That's a good thing to have.
307,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,>> It is a very good thing to have.
308,00:19:01.33,00:19:01.33,We started talking about the game and the fact that my wife
309,00:19:04.08,00:19:04.08,is such a perceptive person and great at strategizing.
310,00:19:08.33,00:19:08.33,Immediately she just invested her whole mind into what I was
311,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,going through and interjected herself into the game.
312,00:19:17.67,00:19:17.67,>> I'm starting to feel like it's going to end up being all
313,00:19:20.54,00:19:20.54,men at the end. >> We're going to take out Aras.
314,00:19:23.50,00:19:23.50,"Me and Cirie, when it gets to the four probably."
315,00:19:26.04,00:19:26.04,>> But Danielle is gone. >> She knows she's done.
316,00:19:28.00,00:19:28.00,">> I tell you what, if I were her..."
317,00:19:30.08,00:19:30.08,>> I'd look for the idol. >> But the idol is in his bag
318,00:19:32.79,00:19:32.79,that's in your bedroom right now.
319,00:19:34.33,00:19:34.33,">> He hasn't told me, I'm serious."
320,00:19:36.17,00:19:36.17,">> You know, the thing that was really weird is that Terry's"
321,00:19:39.46,00:19:39.46,"wife, Tricia, is more competitive than Terry."
322,00:19:42.46,00:19:42.46,So she was the one that wanted to talk about strategy.
323,00:19:45.83,00:19:45.83,"What a lovely woman, but unbelievably competitive."
324,00:19:53.08,00:19:53.08,It's been hard out here without you.
325,00:19:59.04,00:19:59.04,>> I think my dad's doing really well in the game 'cause
326,00:20:01.83,00:20:01.83,he knows how to play the game. He's really smart and athletic.
327,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,He's like a brother to me more than a father.
328,00:20:08.17,00:20:08.17,"We do everything together. And he's like a kid and he,"
329,00:20:10.62,00:20:10.62,"like, he does fun things with me and stuff, so I really missed"
330,00:20:13.67,00:20:13.67,him. >> I love you.
331,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,">> I love you, too, Dad. You okay?"
332,00:20:19.12,00:20:19.12,">> I'm so good. I just remember him saying, you"
333,00:20:23.08,00:20:23.08,"know what I mean, like, ""Shane, here comes your son, Boston."""
334,00:20:25.46,00:20:25.46,I just couldn't believe it. >> This is nice.
335,00:20:29.71,00:20:29.71,>> I didn't really give a crap that much about the bed.
336,00:20:31.79,00:20:31.79,It was who I was sleeping with was extremely wonderful.
337,00:20:36.25,00:20:36.25,"(both laughing) We had some private time, but I"
338,00:20:39.08,00:20:39.08,"tell you, just the snuggling, just the snuggling and being"
339,00:20:42.21,00:20:42.21,"able to sleep with my wife was just a warm, warm feeling."
340,00:20:45.21,00:20:45.21,"God, this is awesome. >> Okay, baby."
341,00:21:01.96,00:21:01.96,>> Do you see that stuff right there?
342,00:21:04.96,00:21:04.96,>> Uh-huh. >> Those branches?
343,00:21:06.75,00:21:06.75,>> Yeah. >> Can you get that?
344,00:21:08.21,00:21:08.21,">> Yep. As soon as I got up, it was"
345,00:21:10.04,00:21:10.04,"like, ""Okay, we need to do the fire, okay, we need to get food,"
346,00:21:12.58,00:21:12.58,"okay, we need to get water,"" and I'm like, ""Oh, my God, we just"
347,00:21:16.79,00:21:16.79,"woke up already!"" >> We need to reserve our"
348,00:21:21.33,00:21:21.33,"energy, so he needs to help us and he needs to see what we do"
349,00:21:24.79,00:21:24.79,daily. But he likes it.
350,00:21:27.79,00:21:27.79,"He doesn't mind. Thank you, honey."
351,00:21:29.38,00:21:29.38,>> Uh-huh. Cirie and Aras have been working
352,00:21:31.50,00:21:31.50,me like a dog and it's bugging me a little bit.
353,00:21:34.88,00:21:34.88,"It's like, ""Honey Bunny, can you go get us some water?"
354,00:21:38.00,00:21:38.00,"Honey Bunny, can you get us some more twigs?"
355,00:21:40.46,00:21:40.46,"Honey Bunny, can you cut this coconut?"
356,00:21:42.83,00:21:42.83,"""Honey Bunny, can you scale this fish?"""
357,00:21:46.17,00:21:46.17,"I'm like, ""Oh, gosh, you're killing me out here."""
358,00:21:49.67,00:21:49.67,"Y'all got your own little servant, boy, I tell you."
359,00:21:51.79,00:21:51.79,(Cirie laughing) Mm-mm-mm! Y'all are livin' it
360,00:21:53.38,00:21:53.38,"up, living it up! But I know that I'm not going to"
361,00:21:57.00,00:21:57.00,"be here long, so I'm going to help as much as I can."
362,00:22:01.21,00:22:01.21,"Boy, here goes nothing. >> Oh, my gosh."
363,00:22:16.12,00:22:16.12,">> I'm so proud of Cirie. I mean, words can't even"
364,00:22:19.25,00:22:19.25,"express, you know... (sobbing): ...words can't even"
365,00:22:24.58,00:22:24.58,express how I feel just to know that Cirie is doing this for her
366,00:22:29.17,00:22:29.17,family. It's wonderful to see that she
367,00:22:31.46,00:22:31.46,would come out here and take this risk for us.
368,00:22:34.00,00:22:34.00,"I love you so much, baby. >> I love you, too, honey."
369,00:22:36.79,00:22:36.79,">> She's my hero. >> Bye, honey."
370,00:22:39.42,00:22:39.42,">> All right, baby. >> See you, H.B.!"
371,00:22:42.67,00:22:42.67,">> Take care of him, honey. >> Having H.B. at camp brought"
372,00:22:48.92,00:22:48.92,back why I'm here. I'm not just here for me.
373,00:22:51.54,00:22:51.54,I'm here for us as a family. I want H.B. to have a better
374,00:22:55.88,00:22:55.88,"life. I want us to have, like, a"
375,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,wonderful life. >> What up?
376,00:23:09.88,00:23:09.88,"How was it, guys? Did you get your good night's"
377,00:23:13.17,00:23:13.17,sleep in? >> Oh...!
378,00:23:20.17,00:23:20.17,>> You are so welcome. You know what?
379,00:23:22.88,00:23:22.88,The choices were so clear to me. >> When Terry and Shane returned
380,00:23:27.12,00:23:27.12,"from their reward, Terry was kind of explaining his reasoning"
381,00:23:31.58,00:23:31.58,for delegating the time the way he did.
382,00:23:37.79,00:23:37.79,">> Terry, just to let you know, 24 or not 24, man, everybody out"
383,00:23:42.42,00:23:42.42,here wanted to see their family members.
384,00:23:44.12,00:23:44.12,"Just as bad as you wanted to see Trish, I wanted to spend the"
385,00:23:46.17,00:23:46.17,"night with my mom, and to, like, think, ""Well, it's just a mom,"""
386,00:23:49.25,00:23:49.25,that rubs me the wrong way when you say that.
387,00:23:51.46,00:23:51.46,">> When you get married, in my viewpoint, there's no choice."
388,00:23:54.08,00:23:54.08,If I had a choice to see my wife or I had a choice to see my
389,00:23:57.21,00:23:57.21,"mother, I'm seeing my wife. >> You won your reward."
390,00:24:00.54,00:24:00.54,"Congratulations, you got to be with your wife."
391,00:24:03.17,00:24:03.17,"I didn't get to be with my mom, so have a little bit of sympathy"
392,00:24:06.71,00:24:06.71,"and understanding. Dude, 33 days, man."
393,00:24:09.96,00:24:09.96,You know? >> Mm-hmm.
394,00:24:11.96,00:24:11.96,>> And that is my rock. Everyone's got their rock...
395,00:24:14.17,00:24:14.17,>> Right. >> ...and what you're saying is
396,00:24:16.04,00:24:16.04,"""Well, that rock is more important than that rock."""
397,00:24:18.62,00:24:18.62,My mom is huge for me. >> Here I have some 24-year-old
398,00:24:22.29,00:24:22.29,"kid lecturing me-- ""My mom is my rock and she means as much to me"
399,00:24:27.54,00:24:27.54,"as your wife means to you."" I like the fact that Aras came"
400,00:24:31.25,00:24:31.25,unglued. It showed a part of him that I
401,00:24:34.67,00:24:34.67,hadn't seen and maybe a little crack that I can take advantage
402,00:24:37.71,00:24:37.71,"of. When you have a wife, you'll"
403,00:24:39.75,00:24:39.75,"know this. When it happens for you, it will"
404,00:24:42.00,00:24:42.00,happen. >> The least that I would expect
405,00:24:44.46,00:24:44.46,from a 46-year-old man who talks about his age over a 24-year-old
406,00:24:48.42,00:24:48.42,all the time is respect. That doesn't register with
407,00:24:51.21,00:24:51.21,Terry. But what he's doing is he's
408,00:24:53.17,00:24:53.17,"feeding my fire, and the more he does it, the more I want to beat"
409,00:24:56.79,00:24:56.79,"him. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
410,00:25:12.71,00:25:12.71,We'll now bring in Danielle from Exile Island.
411,00:25:23.92,00:25:23.92,>> Hey. >> PROBST: How was it?
412,00:25:28.38,00:25:28.38,">> It was awesome. The weather was beautiful, so it"
413,00:25:31.33,00:25:31.33,made my experience a lot more enjoyable than the first time.
414,00:25:34.58,00:25:34.58,>> PROBST: All right. Ready to get to today's immunity
415,00:25:36.88,00:25:36.88,challenge? >> Yep.
416,00:25:37.88,00:25:37.88,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: First things first,"
417,00:25:39.17,00:25:39.17,Terry. After four straight individual
418,00:25:47.00,00:25:47.00,"immunity wins by Terry, the immunity necklace is back up for"
419,00:25:51.17,00:25:51.17,grabs. Today's immunity challenge is
420,00:25:54.04,00:25:54.04,going to require balance and a steady hand.
421,00:25:57.04,00:25:57.04,You are each going to stand on a very small perch at the top of a
422,00:26:01.33,00:26:01.33,"20-foot pole in the water. On my go, you will lower a"
423,00:26:05.00,00:26:05.00,"bucket into the water, take that water, and pour it into a very"
424,00:26:08.62,00:26:08.62,narrow bamboo shoot. As the bamboo shoot fills up
425,00:26:12.04,00:26:12.04,"with water, it will raise a flag."
426,00:26:14.04,00:26:14.04,"When the flag is high enough for you to reach, grab it."
427,00:26:17.04,00:26:17.04,"First person to raise their flag over their head wins immunity,"
428,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,guaranteed a spot in the final four.
429,00:26:23.33,00:26:23.33,That is a one-in-four shot for the million bucks.
430,00:26:26.96,00:26:26.96,One big rule: your feet are on the perch.
431,00:26:30.54,00:26:30.54,"Your butt, your knees cannot touch the perch."
432,00:26:33.12,00:26:33.12,Make sense? >> Yeah.
433,00:26:35.17,00:26:35.17,">> PROBST: Losers-- Tribal Council tonight, somebody going"
434,00:26:36.83,00:26:36.83,home. We'll draw for positions and get
435,00:26:38.71,00:26:38.71,started. (Cirie shrieks)
436,00:26:52.08,00:26:52.08,For immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four.
437,00:26:55.21,00:26:55.21,Survivors ready? Go.
438,00:27:02.29,00:27:02.29,Terry quickly up with a bucket of water and he's pouring.
439,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,Cirie really taking her time. Aras pouring.
440,00:27:12.21,00:27:12.21,Danielle pouring. Nobody hitting the bamboo shoot
441,00:27:14.62,00:27:14.62,yet. Your goal is to get water in
442,00:27:17.67,00:27:17.67,that bamboo shoot as quickly as you can.
443,00:27:21.04,00:27:21.04,"As the bamboo shoot fills up, the flag will raise."
444,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,Terry's flag starting to raise. Danielle's starting to raise a
445,00:27:30.08,00:27:30.08,little bit. Patience and balance-- the key.
446,00:27:37.21,00:27:37.21,Aras gets a little bit of water in that shoot.
447,00:27:41.12,00:27:41.12,Terry's flag moving up quickly. Danielle's moving up.
448,00:27:46.42,00:27:46.42,Cirie surprising herself 20 feet up in the air.
449,00:27:51.75,00:27:51.75,"Shane still with nothing. Aras now on the board, his flag"
450,00:27:58.83,00:27:58.83,starting to rise. Cirie's flag starting to rise.
451,00:28:03.96,00:28:03.96,"Shane not having much luck yet, water going everywhere."
452,00:28:07.79,00:28:07.79,"It's pretty even right now-- Terry, Danielle, neck and neck."
453,00:28:13.25,00:28:13.25,Cirie right in it. Shane has absolutely nothing
454,00:28:18.25,00:28:18.25,happening. >> 'Cause I've been pouring into
455,00:28:20.08,00:28:20.08,the wrong hole like a moron. >> PROBST: Shane just now
456,00:28:23.38,00:28:23.38,"figuring out the challenge. >> That's never good, is it now,"
457,00:28:26.92,00:28:26.92,Jeff? That's never good!
458,00:28:29.42,00:28:29.42,">> PROBST: Aras gets a nice bit of water in that chute, his flag"
459,00:28:33.62,00:28:33.62,raises quite a bit. Immunity on the line.
460,00:28:36.62,00:28:36.62,"Terry still with a bit of a lead over Cirie, Danielle, and Aras."
461,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,"Everybody in this except Shane, who's starting to figure it out"
462,00:28:43.25,00:28:43.25,"now. Aras catching up, his flag"
463,00:28:45.67,00:28:45.67,raises quite a bit. Terry getting closer with each
464,00:28:48.67,00:28:48.67,bucket. Aras and Danielle right behind
465,00:28:51.33,00:28:51.33,him. Terry getting much closer to
466,00:28:54.17,00:28:54.17,where he can reach down and grab it.
467,00:28:56.08,00:28:56.08,Aras getting close enough that he can reach down and grab it.
468,00:28:59.12,00:28:59.12,"Is it close enough for Terry? No, not close enough for Aras"
469,00:29:02.50,00:29:02.50,either. One or two more buckets could do
470,00:29:05.04,00:29:05.04,"it. Terry right on the money,"
471,00:29:09.17,00:29:09.17,"raising his flag quite a bit. Aras fighting back, not giving"
472,00:29:12.29,00:29:12.29,up. Aras getting closer.
473,00:29:15.21,00:29:15.21,Terry's almost there. Terry reaching for the flag.
474,00:29:19.88,00:29:19.88,Terry... >> Yeah!
475,00:29:21.42,00:29:21.42,>> PROBST: ...wins immunity for the fifth straight time!
476,00:29:25.29,00:29:25.29,(Terry yells) >> Shut up.
477,00:29:29.62,00:29:29.62,(Terry laughs) >> PROBST: Oh.
478,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,"Terry, come on over. You are undefeated in individual"
479,00:29:44.50,00:29:44.50,"immunity challenges. Once again, Terry is safe at"
480,00:29:48.04,00:29:48.04,"Tribal Council. Cirie, Shane, Danielle, Aras,"
481,00:29:52.08,00:29:52.08,"for one of you, the game will come to an end tonight."
482,00:29:54.29,00:29:54.29,"Swim on in, I'll see you at Tribal."
483,00:29:56.08,00:29:56.08,">> (mimicking Probst): For one of you, the game will end"
484,00:29:59.00,00:29:59.00,tonight. (sings dramatic fanfare)
485,00:30:10.96,00:30:10.96,>> Hoo-ee! >> That was fun.
486,00:30:16.04,00:30:16.04,Winning the immunity challenge today was huge because it
487,00:30:19.46,00:30:19.46,"doesn't just win me the four, it vaults me into the final three."
488,00:30:23.00,00:30:23.00,"I have the hidden immunity idol, I don't even have to show up for"
489,00:30:26.83,00:30:26.83,the next immunity challenge. What a relief.
490,00:30:29.71,00:30:29.71,"I've had the hugest target on my back, now the pressure is off."
491,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,>> I think she's depressed 'cause she knows she's next.
492,00:30:44.62,00:30:44.62,"The plan is for me, Aras, and Cirie to take out Danielle"
493,00:30:47.88,00:30:47.88,tonight. And I'm in a great space.
494,00:30:49.92,00:30:49.92,I've set myself up so that I'm safe and I feel like things are
495,00:30:53.08,00:30:53.08,going to be solid. >> After what happened at
496,00:31:01.54,00:31:01.54,"Tribal Council the other night, Danielle, you know, she blew me"
497,00:31:04.58,00:31:04.58,off so I wouldn't feel too bad sending her off.
498,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,"And from what I know, she's going anyway."
499,00:31:14.17,00:31:14.17,">> My guess is it's going to go down that way, yes."
500,00:31:17.92,00:31:17.92,>> I would love to take Shane to the final two.
501,00:31:20.04,00:31:20.04,"Not that he doesn't work, but my case speaks for itself."
502,00:31:23.38,00:31:23.38,Going out fishing for people and cleaning up the camp and
503,00:31:26.08,00:31:26.08,collecting firewood and building fires and teaching
504,00:31:28.92,00:31:28.92,people stuff. With a huge target on my back
505,00:31:31.21,00:31:31.21,"and winning the challenges, that I think would be a"
506,00:31:33.08,00:31:33.08,no-brainer even for a heavily loyal Casaya jury.
507,00:31:46.21,00:31:46.21,>> Shane thinks I'm going home. It's so funny how he thinks he
508,00:31:51.08,00:31:51.08,"knows what's going on and, like, he's controlling everything."
509,00:31:54.42,00:31:54.42,He doesn't know anything. >> I was in an alliance with
510,00:31:58.67,00:31:58.67,"Shane, but I found out he wanted to take Courtney to the"
511,00:32:01.12,00:32:01.12,final two and so that pretty much puts me off the hook.
512,00:32:04.21,00:32:04.21,I no longer feel any obligation. >> Yeah?
513,00:32:08.08,00:32:08.08,>> ...and she's good. >> I've done a really good job
514,00:32:11.12,00:32:11.12,of setting Shane up for a situation like this.
515,00:32:13.04,00:32:13.04,Shane thinks I'm his puppy dog. He thinks he can tell me to do
516,00:32:15.62,00:32:15.62,"this and I'll do it because, up until this point, I have."
517,00:32:18.67,00:32:18.67,Which really makes it easy for me to do things pretty
518,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,inconspicuously. >> I know that Shane is looking
519,00:32:29.42,00:32:29.42,"to get rid of me, I'm looking to get rid of him."
520,00:32:31.50,00:32:31.50,"Terry's out for me, he's pissed off, but I have a strong bond"
521,00:32:35.17,00:32:35.17,with Aras and Cirie. Cirie especially.
522,00:32:42.04,00:32:42.04,"I just trust Cirie with my life. Like, I really, really do."
523,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,It's so key in this game to have one person at least that you can
524,00:32:48.92,00:32:48.92,trust. So I'm pretty confident right
525,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,now with my alliance. >> This one is going to go
526,00:32:59.00,00:32:59.00,Danielle. >> Right.
527,00:33:00.58,00:33:00.58,>> And then the next one we'll go Aras.
528,00:33:03.17,00:33:03.17,"But we can't look like we're betraying Aras, because then"
529,00:33:05.25,00:33:05.25,he'll remember that on the jury. >> Right.
530,00:33:07.79,00:33:07.79,">> And you're straight, you feel good, and you're 100% with me?"
531,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,>> 100%. No problem.
532,00:33:12.33,00:33:12.33,">> You, Danielle and Aras aren't ... me, correct?"
533,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,">> No. No, no, no, no, no. >> All right."
534,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,I feel good. I think we're probably pretty
535,00:33:19.08,00:33:19.08,good to the three. >> Yes.
536,00:33:21.79,00:33:21.79,"Shane thinks that me, him and Aras are going to vote for"
537,00:33:25.33,00:33:25.33,"Danielle when, in all actuality, Aras and Danielle are going to"
538,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,vote for Shane. Aras and Danielle-- those are
539,00:33:33.08,00:33:33.08,the two people I've had the longest alliance with.
540,00:33:37.04,00:33:37.04,"At the same time, this is still a game and you have to look at"
541,00:33:41.29,00:33:41.29,"it logically, because I think Danielle will be able to beat"
542,00:33:44.88,00:33:44.88,me in the final two. Courtney didn't hold true to
543,00:33:47.17,00:33:47.17,"Danielle's friendship, and I think Bruce kind of had a love"
544,00:33:51.54,00:33:51.54,"affair with Danielle, and I don't know if her and Austin"
545,00:33:56.17,00:33:56.17,bonded at Exile Island when they almost died.
546,00:33:59.04,00:33:59.04,So Danielle is a threat. >> I think I've set myself up so
547,00:34:05.79,00:34:05.79,"that I'm safe, and I feel like, at this point, I could beat"
548,00:34:10.04,00:34:10.04,anybody. I feel like I could.
549,00:34:14.92,00:34:14.92,"I mean, I feel comfortable, as comfortable as you can feel out"
550,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,here. (laughter)
551,00:34:22.25,00:34:22.25,"Like, am I going tonight? Just let me know if I'm going"
552,00:34:24.25,00:34:24.25,"tonight. >> I love Aras, but I'm going"
553,00:34:32.38,00:34:32.38,"to do everything, everything that I can do to get myself"
554,00:34:37.67,00:34:37.67,further in the game. So it is safe to say that
555,00:34:40.92,00:34:40.92,somebody's going to be surprised tonight.
556,00:34:43.29,00:34:43.29,"There's going to be huge fireworks, bigger than the"
557,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,Fourth of July. (laughing)
558,00:35:03.96,00:35:03.96,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
559,00:35:08.04,00:35:08.04,Austin... Sally...
560,00:35:12.46,00:35:12.46,Bruce... and Courtney...
561,00:35:16.25,00:35:16.25,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
562,00:35:20.62,00:35:20.62,"Terry, let's talk about the loved one challenge."
563,00:35:22.75,00:35:22.75,Was that a tough dilemma being in charge of allocating the
564,00:35:26.17,00:35:26.17,love? >> It's always a tough charge
565,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"when you're put in almost a ""God"" position."
566,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,"But the initial thing for me, obviously, was my wife, followed"
567,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,by Shane and then H.B. got to go see what Cirie was up to.
568,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,"Uh, you know, I'm afraid if I offended anybody, but I think it"
569,00:35:40.54,00:35:40.54,"all worked out okay. >> PROBST: Cirie, how did your"
570,00:35:44.75,00:35:44.75,husband like living at camp? >> He was thankful for the
571,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,"experience, um... but ready to go home."
572,00:35:52.29,00:35:52.29,"You know, he's like a city guy. But for him to get to see what"
573,00:35:55.38,00:35:55.38,"we go through, it left him extremely, extremely proud."
574,00:36:00.00,00:36:00.00,"He said I was his hero. Um, this is something once-in-a-"
575,00:36:03.38,00:36:03.38,"lifetime for us. >> PROBST: Shane, you waited a"
576,00:36:06.38,00:36:06.38,long time for Boston to get here.
577,00:36:08.46,00:36:08.46,">> It was, um... Yesterday was unbelievable."
578,00:36:13.46,00:36:13.46,"It was a magical, magical, like, vacation with him and we were"
579,00:36:17.62,00:36:17.62,"just hanging and being dad and son, and as I watched the sun"
580,00:36:20.75,00:36:20.75,"go down, I just thought to myself there's absolutely"
581,00:36:24.88,00:36:24.88,nowhere else on the planet Earth I would rather be.
582,00:36:32.04,00:36:32.04,>> PROBST: Let's get to the immunity challenge.
583,00:36:34.17,00:36:34.17,Terry wins again. Five straight.
584,00:36:38.42,00:36:38.42,"Aras, there's an obvious competition between you two."
585,00:36:42.54,00:36:42.54,">> For me, it just becomes more fun in a competitive sense."
586,00:36:45.21,00:36:45.21,"You can look at it any way you want, every time is a crack at"
587,00:36:48.00,00:36:48.00,him. The thing of it is with Terry is
588,00:36:50.75,00:36:50.75,that he knows it just takes one crack and he's done.
589,00:36:53.08,00:36:53.08,">> PROBST: At what point do you stop saying ""Just one crack and"
590,00:36:56.08,00:36:56.08,"he's done"" and start saying ""Terry's looking pretty good"
591,00:36:58.92,00:36:58.92,"right now."" >> Well, Jeff, this way that I"
592,00:37:00.92,00:37:00.92,"look at it, is the challenges-- just one part of the game."
593,00:37:04.25,00:37:04.25,You can win all the challenges you want.
594,00:37:06.00,00:37:06.00,"If you don't win people over, you don't win the million"
595,00:37:07.92,00:37:07.92,"dollars. >> PROBST: Shane, can you be"
596,00:37:10.96,00:37:10.96,trusted at this point in the game?
597,00:37:13.17,00:37:13.17,">> Yes, absolutely. I have not lied to anyone."
598,00:37:15.25,00:37:15.25,I have not cheated anyone. My integrity is 100% intact.
599,00:37:20.42,00:37:20.42,">> PROBST: How about you, Danielle?"
600,00:37:22.50,00:37:22.50,"Can you be trusted? >> Um, when you feel like you"
601,00:37:24.75,00:37:24.75,lose trust with someone or someone's doing something
602,00:37:27.79,00:37:27.79,sneaky behind your back or talking about voting you off
603,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,"first, then you make a move. That's how I look at it."
604,00:37:33.42,00:37:33.42,You have to make moves in the game to further yourself.
605,00:37:37.67,00:37:37.67,"I mean, that's the whole point of the game, isn't it?"
606,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,>> PROBST: I'm looking at the immunity challenge today and
607,00:37:42.33,00:37:42.33,"here's what I saw. Cirie, Danielle working hard."
608,00:37:46.67,00:37:46.67,"Terry, Aras working hard. Shane pouring the water down"
609,00:37:50.21,00:37:50.21,"the wrong hole, kind of making jokes."
610,00:37:53.12,00:37:53.12,"If you were less comfortable at this point in the game, would"
611,00:37:56.33,00:37:56.33,today's immunity challenge have had a different feeling for you?
612,00:37:59.92,00:37:59.92,">> You know, I have one thing in my favor which is, I feel"
613,00:38:02.08,00:38:02.08,like I'm sort of being carried to the end because I don't
614,00:38:06.58,00:38:06.58,"know, I feel like everyone here thinks they can beat me if we"
615,00:38:09.83,00:38:09.83,"get to the jury, or maybe more easily than, like, Cirie who's"
616,00:38:13.79,00:38:13.79,"a mother of three and an unbelievable person, or Aras"
617,00:38:16.17,00:38:16.17,"who's the golden boy who at any point could levitate home, you"
618,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,know what I mean? There might be a little more
619,00:38:22.75,00:38:22.75,"rust on me, you know? >> PROBST: Danielle, how"
620,00:38:26.29,00:38:26.29,"worried are you, being two days away, that you have no idea"
621,00:38:30.46,00:38:30.46,what's in store tonight? >> I'm scared.
622,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,"I mean, I've been away for two days on Exile Island."
623,00:38:35.71,00:38:35.71,"You don't know what's going on, you come back to camp and, you"
624,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,"know, there could be other alliances formed or whatever."
625,00:38:41.33,00:38:41.33,I can only wish and pray. I... I don't feel comfortable.
626,00:38:48.04,00:38:48.04,">> PROBST: Okay, let's get to the vote."
627,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,Terry has the individual immunity necklace.
628,00:38:52.21,00:38:52.21,"You going to keep it? >> Oh, yeah."
629,00:38:53.96,00:38:53.96,>> PROBST: And once again this hidden immunity idol has yet to
630,00:38:55.96,00:38:55.96,have come into play. If somebody has it and they're
631,00:38:58.17,00:38:58.17,"going to use it, they'll use it after the vote."
632,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,"It is time to vote. Aras, you're up."
633,00:39:13.67,00:39:13.67,">> (whispers): Shane, sorry, brother."
634,00:39:49.58,00:39:49.58,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
635,00:40:01.21,00:40:01.21,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
636,00:40:03.92,00:40:03.92,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
637,00:40:06.00,00:40:06.00,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
638,00:40:10.08,00:40:10.08,First vote... Danielle.
639,00:40:16.38,00:40:16.38,"Shane. One vote Danielle, one vote"

644,00:40:43.08,00:40:43.08,>> PROBST: That's enough votes. You need to bring me your torch.
645,00:40:52.17,00:40:52.17,">> Oh, my God, I'm going to have a chocolate ice-cream bar"
646,00:40:55.25,00:40:55.25,in about one minute... I mean one minute.
647,00:41:00.17,00:41:00.17,">> PROBST: Shane, the tribe has spoken."
648,00:41:18.88,00:41:18.88,">> PROBST: Well, the last two Tribal Councils, the person"
649,00:41:21.92,00:41:21.92,"voted out has been absolutely shocked, so if trust wasn't an"
650,00:41:26.38,00:41:26.38,"issue, it certainly will be from here on out."
651,00:41:29.54,00:41:29.54,"Six days left, grab your torches, head back to camp."

658,00:41:54.21,00:41:54.21,people like you want to be talked to.
659,00:41:56.50,00:41:56.50,>> Whoa! >> PROBST: The Terry-Aras
