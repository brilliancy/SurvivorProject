124,00:06:45.87,00:06:45.87,IS NOTHING ABOUT YOU. >> TONY MOVED UP A LEVEL AS A
125,00:06:49.17,00:06:49.17,PLAYER BY MAKING TWO BIG MOVES-- BLINDSIDING L.J. AND BLINDSIDING
126,00:06:53.07,00:06:53.07,JEFRA AND USING PEOPLE OUTSIDE HIS ALLIANCE TO DO THAT AND NOT
127,00:06:56.30,00:06:56.30,LETTING PEOPLE IN THE ALLIANCE IN.
128,00:06:57.70,00:06:57.70,NOW IT'S PUT A RED FLAG OUT THERE THAT TONY IS WILLING TO DO
129,00:07:01.67,00:07:01.67,ANYTHING TO ANYBODY. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WENT WITH HIM
130,00:07:04.00,00:07:04.00,ARE JUST CULT MEMBERS. I DON'T WANT TO BE A CULT
131,00:07:06.40,00:07:06.40,MEMBER. I WANT TO KILL THE CULT LEADER.

135,00:07:51.13,00:07:51.13,SO SHE DOESN'T GET ANY BRILLIANT IDEAS TO TRY TO OUST ME.
136,00:07:54.40,00:07:54.40,"KASS I WANTED TO TELL YOU REAL QUICK, WERE YOU JOKING OR DID"

145,00:08:18.03,00:08:18.03,>> I JUST TOLD YOU WHAT YOU SAID.
146,00:08:20.27,00:08:20.27,LET'S HAVE A BIG ARGUMENT. >> I KNOW WHAT I SAID BUT YOU
147,00:08:22.47,00:08:22.47,"DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HEARD. >> TONY, EVERYTHING THAT COMES"
148,00:08:24.97,00:08:24.97,OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS A LIE. >> I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT YOU.
149,00:08:27.87,00:08:27.87,I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT YOU. >> THIS IS A CLASSIC SIGN OF
150,00:08:31.80,00:08:31.80,SOMEONE WHO HAS GOTTEN TOO DEEP INTO THEIR OWN LIES THEY DON'T
151,00:08:36.17,00:08:36.17,KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ANYTHING.
152,00:08:38.97,00:08:38.97,">> YOU MAKE NO SENSE. >> THEN DON'T TALK TO ME, TONY."
153,00:08:41.97,00:08:41.97,>> YOU MAKE NO SENSE. >> TONY IS LOOSING IT.
154,00:08:44.80,00:08:44.80,"TONY, I'M HAPPY HE'S IMPLODING. I LIKE TO HAVE CHAOS AND I LIKE"
155,00:08:47.87,00:08:47.87,TO HAVE TROUBLE. I LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE AT THEIR
156,00:08:50.20,00:08:50.20,BREAKING POINT IN THIS GAME BECAUSE IT BRINGS OUT THE WORST
157,00:08:52.67,00:08:52.67,"IN THEM, AND I EXPECT THAT OF HIM BECAUSE HE'S AN IDIOT."
158,00:08:58.37,00:08:58.37,>> SHE HAS TO FLATTER HERSELF. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HER.
159,00:09:02.20,00:09:02.20,I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU. I HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU

162,00:09:11.17,00:09:11.17,I'M GOOD. AND THEN SHE'S LOOKING AT ME
163,00:09:14.40,00:09:14.40,WITH THAT STUPID GRIN ON HER FACE LIKE SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S
164,00:09:17.93,00:09:17.93,"TALKING ABOUT. A NUT JOB, MAN."
165,00:09:20.37,00:09:20.37,>> KASS IS CONVINCED THAT SHE HEARD TONY TALKING ABOUT HER.
166,00:09:23.93,00:09:23.93,"I DON'T REALLY KNOW. BUT YOU CAN'T CONVINCE HER THAT,"

169,00:09:36.97,00:09:36.97,">> HOW OLD ARE YOU, 40? >> YES."
170,00:09:38.57,00:09:38.57,>> YOU ACT LIKE A FOUR-YEAR-OLD. >> THAT'S WHY I'M COMB POSED AND

366,00:20:39.43,00:20:39.43,"STRESSFUL BECAUSE ALL I'M GETTING FROM WOO IS, ""YEAH."
367,00:20:44.07,00:20:44.07,YEAH. SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.
368,00:20:46.97,00:20:46.97,"RIGHT."" >> YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING"

371,00:20:56.93,00:20:56.93,"IT. AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, IT'S"
372,00:21:02.77,00:21:02.77,GOING TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL GAME. AND WE ALL HAVE TO BE LOOKING
373,00:21:05.83,00:21:05.83,OUT FOR OURSELVES. >> DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?
374,00:21:09.73,00:21:09.73,">> PLAYING THIS GAME FROM DAY ONE WITH TONY, IT'S HARD TO DP"
375,00:21:14.07,00:21:14.07,AGAINST HIM. >> LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
376,00:21:15.57,00:21:15.57,">> BUT THIS GAME, IT'S DOING WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MOVE YOURSELF"
377,00:21:20.00,00:21:20.00,FORWARD. SO IF THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO

379,00:21:25.67,00:21:25.67,"DEFINITELY CONSIDER. >> SO AS FAR AS STRATEGY, I CAN"
380,00:21:35.80,00:21:35.80,TALK TO TASHA ABOUT WHAT WE DISCUSSED.
381,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,">> OKAY, PERFECT. >> OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL"
382,00:21:41.23,00:21:41.23,"YOU DECIDE FOR SURE, WOO? >> YEAH."

385,00:21:47.97,00:21:47.97,I THINK WOO IS MAYBE GETTING IN GAME MODE.
386,00:21:51.57,00:21:51.57,"WALKING BACK FROM THE REWARD, HE JUST SAID, ""I'M ON BOARD."""
387,00:21:54.27,00:21:54.27,AND I LIKE THAT HE TOOK THAT TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.
388,00:21:56.43,00:21:56.43,IT SHOWS ME HE'S JUST NOT KNEEJERKING THIS GAME.
389,00:22:00.03,00:22:00.03,">> I'M NOT GOING TO DISCLOSE ANYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED, NO"
390,00:22:04.77,00:22:04.77,"WAY. >> NO,."

393,00:22:12.43,00:22:12.43,HOW WAS IT? >> GOOD.
394,00:22:15.73,00:22:15.73,"EPIC, MAN. THE KIDS LOVING US."
395,00:22:17.27,00:22:17.27,">> WOO WAS AN ENTERTAIN. WOO WAS, LIKE, MAKING ALL THESE"
396,00:22:20.70,00:22:20.70,KIDS LAUGH. HE WAS ENTERTAINING HUNDREDS OF

398,00:22:25.73,00:22:25.73,THE WAY. I WANT TO EAT SM OF.
399,00:22:27.20,00:22:27.20,>> IT WAS A COOL EXPERIENCE. >> SO KASS REALIZES THAT TONY

404,00:22:49.43,00:22:49.43,SEND HOME TRISH. AND THEN WE SEND HOME TONY NEXT
405,00:22:52.60,00:22:52.60,WEEK. >> DO YOU TOTALLY TRUST WOO?
406,00:22:54.87,00:22:54.87,">> HOPEFULLY HE'S WITH US, BECAUSE IF HE ISN'T, TONY NOW"
407,00:22:58.63,00:22:58.63,KNOWS EVERYTHING. >> YES.
408,00:22:59.73,00:22:59.73,>> TONY RESIDENT PEOPLE REALLY WELL.
409,00:23:01.33,00:23:01.33,IT'S VERY HARD TO LIE TO HIM. >> I WONDER IF THEY GOT WOO.
410,00:23:11.13,00:23:11.13,TO BLINDSIDE US. >> I'LL FIND OUT.
411,00:23:13.60,00:23:13.60,"I'LL SAY, ""WOO, ANY STRATEGY TALK?"

414,00:23:23.63,00:23:23.63,>> THEN HE'S LYING. AND WE KNOW WE'RE SCREWED.
415,00:23:26.40,00:23:26.40,">> WHAT'S UP, KARATE KID? >> OH, MAN."
416,00:23:29.70,00:23:29.70,>> ANY STRATEGY TALK? >> YEAH.
417,00:23:31.70,00:23:31.70,>> WHO WAS TALKING? >> KASS AND SPENCER ARE SAYING
418,00:23:35.17,00:23:35.17,WE SHOULD TAKE OUT TASHA. >> THAT'S THEIR STRATEGY TALK?
419,00:23:39.00,00:23:39.00,WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE SPENCER? >> I DON'T KNOW.
420,00:23:40.77,00:23:40.77,>> SO WHAT'S KASS TELL YOU? >> TAKE OUT TASHA.
421,00:23:43.90,00:23:43.90,>> THAT'S WHAT SHE'S TELLING YOU.
422,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,>> YEAH. >> OH.
423,00:23:47.33,00:23:47.33,ANY CLUES OR ANYTHING. WAS SPENCER SAYING ANYTHING?
424,00:23:50.30,00:23:50.30,">> NO. >> OKAY, SHHH!"
425,00:23:53.57,00:23:53.57,"UP TO THIS POINT NOW, WOO HAS BEEN A DISCIPLINED ALLY."
426,00:23:56.20,00:23:56.20,SO I HAVE NO REASON NOT TO TRUST HIM YOU KNOW.
427,00:23:59.30,00:23:59.30,SPENCER DIDN'T MENTION NOTHING ABOUT ME?
428,00:24:00.43,00:24:00.43,>> NO. >> NOTHING ABOUT MY IDOL.
429,00:24:02.30,00:24:02.30,>> NO. >> WOW.

431,00:24:08.03,00:24:08.03,"IT'S TIME TO MAKE A WOO. COME WITH ME, AND TASHA."""
432,00:24:12.43,00:24:12.43,HE DIDN'T PROPOSE THAT. >> NO.
433,00:24:13.70,00:24:13.70,>> NOTHING LIKE THAT? >> THAT DON'T SOUND RIGHT.
434,00:24:16.17,00:24:16.17,">> WOO WAS TELLING ME OH, YES, SPENCER WANTED TO VOTE OFF TASH."
435,00:24:19.53,00:24:19.53,IT DIDN'T MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL. TO GET RID OF ONE NUMBER LOCKED

437,00:24:26.87,00:24:26.87,YOU'RE LYING TO ME. AND WOO MIGHT THINK OF MAKING A

562,00:33:11.33,00:33:11.33,"TONIGHT, MAN. IT'S ME OR HER TONIGHT."

590,00:34:34.93,00:34:34.93,GIFT? I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION
591,00:34:36.10,00:34:36.10,TONIGHT BASED ON CAN I BEAT TONY IN THE FINAL TRIBAL?
592,00:34:39.27,00:34:39.27,AND NOBODY EVER GIVES THE JERK THE MONEY.
593,00:34:41.93,00:34:41.93,SO MAYBE I KEEP HIM. YOU WANT TO TALK FOR A MINUTE?
594,00:34:45.00,00:34:45.00,>> OKAY. >> THIS IS THE POSITION I LOVE.

617,00:36:24.23,00:36:24.23,FROM THE NORM. IT'S LIKE IT WASN'T EVEN AN
618,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83,IMMUNITY NIGHT. SO TO ME I GOT KIND OF WORRIED.
619,00:36:30.47,00:36:30.47,SHE'S BEEN ON A ROLL. SHE'S WON HALF OF THE IMMUNITY
620,00:36:33.23,00:36:33.23,CHALLENGES SO HER NOT BEING WORRIED MADE ME WORRIED AND
621,00:36:36.07,00:36:36.07,THAT'S WHY I GOT MY BAG WITH ME AGAIN TONIGHT.
622,00:36:38.57,00:36:38.57,>> Jeff: OF TRICKS? >> OF TRICKS.

625,00:36:47.73,00:36:47.73,STRATEGIC THREAT AND PUT MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE OVER THERE BUT NO
626,00:36:50.07,00:36:50.07,"ONE WANTS TO SEE TJEFF. >> Jeff: SO, TONY, WHAT DO YOU"
627,00:36:53.73,00:36:53.73,"DO, WHEN YOU'RE CLEARLY TRYING TO DEFLECT THE ATTENTION BUT"
628,00:36:56.70,00:36:56.70,THERE'S ONLY SIX OF YOU? >> I KNOW FOR A FACT ANYTHING
629,00:36:59.27,00:36:59.27,CAN HAPPEN IN THIS GAME. SPENCER AND TASH HAVE BEEN
630,00:37:02.83,00:37:02.83,TRYING TO PLANT THE SEED IN THE HEAD THAT TONY IS DANGEROUS.
631,00:37:05.50,00:37:05.50,BUT THAT'S HER DEFLECTING THE TARGET OFF HER BACK.
632,00:37:08.27,00:37:08.27,"FOR MY ALLIANCE, WE'RE TIGHT. WE'RE LOYAL."
633,00:37:10.93,00:37:10.93,WE'RE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER. AND THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN ALL

635,00:37:17.60,00:37:17.60,LOGIC I'M JUST RELYING ON LOYALTY SEEM GENUINE OR
636,00:37:23.13,00:37:23.13,DISINGENUOUS? >> PROBABLY DISINGENUOUS.
637,00:37:24.90,00:37:24.90,WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO HAVING A FINAL THREE OR FINAL
638,00:37:27.37,00:37:27.37,TWO. SO I WOULD BE PARANOID IF I HAD
639,00:37:29.20,00:37:29.20,A BAG OF TRICKS. >> Jeff: SO IF EVERYBODY
640,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,"BELIEVES THAT TONY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND A SECOND IDOL,"
641,00:37:35.90,00:37:35.90,THIS SEEMS LIKE AN OBVIOUS VOTE TO FLUSH ONE OF THOSE TWO IDOLS
642,00:37:40.30,00:37:40.30,OUT. >> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS TO
643,00:37:42.13,00:37:42.13,"HAPPEN TONIGHT. >> JEFF, WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO"
644,00:37:44.43,00:37:44.43,FLUSH THE IDOLS OUT IF WE'RE TOGETHER?
645,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,KEEPING THE IDOL AWAY FROM THE ENEMY HELPS THE ALLIANCE.
646,00:37:49.27,00:37:49.27,I'M NOT SAYING I'M GOING TO USE IT FOR EVERYBODY WHEN THERE ARE
647,00:37:51.80,00:37:51.80,JUST FOUR LEFT-- >> AND HE WAS PERFECTLY HONEST

649,00:37:57.50,00:37:57.50,WOULD USE IT ON US IF WE NEEDED IT.
650,00:38:00.23,00:38:00.23,">> Jeff: WOO, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO FLUSH SOMEBODY'S BACK OF"
651,00:38:03.10,00:38:03.10,"TRICKS, ONE OR TWO IDOLS, AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME?"

656,00:38:18.57,00:38:18.57,"MADE THAT AFTER VOTING OUT JEFRA, TONY DOES WHAT HE ALWAYS"
657,00:38:22.40,00:38:22.40,DOES-- HE SCOOPS BACK THE PEOPLE IN HIS ALLIANCE THAT WERE

659,00:38:28.00,00:38:28.00,"WE'RE STILL TOGETHER."" AND THEY BELIEVE IT."
660,00:38:29.70,00:38:29.70,AND I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHEN IT WILL CHANGE.
661,00:38:32.17,00:38:32.17,"BUT I'M EXCITED. YOU KNOW, TONY DID BRING HIS BAG"
662,00:38:34.97,00:38:34.97,"OF TRICKS, AND I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT"
663,00:38:38.20,00:38:38.20,AFTER A LONG WAIT TONIGHT. ( LAUGHTER )

675,00:39:11.00,00:39:11.00,"YOU KNOW, HOW AM I GOING TO GET THERE?"
676,00:39:13.30,00:39:13.30,WHO AM I GOING TO GET THERE WITH?
677,00:39:15.57,00:39:15.57,AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? I THINK TONIGHT MIGHT BE A
