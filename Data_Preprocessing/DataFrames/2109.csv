2,00:00:01.58,00:00:01.58,>> Jeff Probst: PREVIOUSLY ON SURVIVOR:
3,00:00:02.88,00:00:02.88,>> REPLACE YOUR OLD BUFFS WITH THESE NEW ONES.
4,00:00:05.04,00:00:05.04,YOU HAVE MERGED.
5,00:00:06.29,00:00:06.29,">> Jeff: AFTER THE MERGE, BRENDA AND SASH WERE CALLING THE SHOTS."
6,00:00:09.25,00:00:09.25,>> WE'RE THE TWO MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.
7,00:00:11.12,00:00:11.12,>> Jeff: MARTY WAS AT THE TOP OF THEIR HIT LIST.
8,00:00:13.04,00:00:13.04,>> MARTY IS SOMEBODY TO WATCH
9,00:00:14.92,00:00:14.92,BECAUSE HE'S IS TALKING TO BENRY AND FABIO AND DAN.
10,00:00:18.62,00:00:18.62,">> HURRY UP, GET YOUR BAG, AND WE'RE GOING TO WALK."
11,00:00:22.58,00:00:22.58,>> Jeff: EVERYTHING BLEW UP WHEN NAONKA TOOK ALINA
12,00:00:24.62,00:00:24.62,ON A FOOD-STEALING MISSION.
13,00:00:28.12,00:00:28.12,THE TRIBE FOUND OUT AND WANTED NAONKA'S HEAD.
14,00:00:30.46,00:00:30.46,>> THAT'S REALLY UNCOOL.
15,00:00:32.17,00:00:32.17,>> Jeff: BUT SASH AND BRENDA WANTED TO PROTECT HER
16,00:00:34.17,00:00:34.17,SO THEY OFFERED UP ALINA INSTEAD.
17,00:00:36.46,00:00:36.46,>> IT SUCKS TO BE ALINA RIGHT NOW.
18,00:00:38.54,00:00:38.54,>> Jeff: BUT MARTY GOT PARANOID
19,00:00:39.96,00:00:39.96,AND THOUGHT HE WAS THE NEXT TO GO.
20,00:00:43.21,00:00:43.21,"SO AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, MARTY TRIED TO SAVE HIMSELF"
21,00:00:45.67,00:00:45.67,BY THROWING JANE UNDER THE BUS.
22,00:00:47.79,00:00:47.79,>> YOU LET THE LITTLE OLD LADY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA...
23,00:00:50.33,00:00:50.33,>> NORTH CAROLINA.
24,00:00:52.83,00:00:52.83,>> THIS LADY WILL TAKE THE MILLION DOLLARS.
25,00:00:57.92,00:00:57.92,>> Jeff: NINTH PERSON VOTED OUT
26,00:00:59.17,00:00:59.17,AND THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
27,00:01:01.33,00:01:01.33,ALINA WAS VOTED OUT.
28,00:01:04.04,00:01:04.04,"ALINA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
29,00:01:05.67,00:01:05.67,NOW THE FEUD BETWEEN JANE AND MARTY HAS REACHED CRITICAL MASS.
30,00:01:09.25,00:01:09.25,"11 ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?"
31,00:01:18.21,00:01:18.21,">> HEY, YOU GUYS, HAND ME YOUR TORCHES."
32,00:01:22.21,00:01:22.21,RIGHT HERE.
33,00:01:24.46,00:01:24.46,>> TRIBAL WAS THE WORST.
34,00:01:30.54,00:01:30.54,">> TRIBAL COUNCIL IS WHERE YOU NEED TO VENT,"
35,00:01:32.42,00:01:32.42,BUT I THINK THAT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL REALLY SHOOK THINGS UP.
36,00:01:36.17,00:01:36.17,I FELT REALLY BAD FOR JANE.
37,00:01:38.54,00:01:38.54,"MARTY, HE WAS GOING A LITTLE TOO HARD ON HER, YOU KNOW,"
38,00:01:41.25,00:01:41.25,LIKE HE'S THROWING PUNCHES BUT SHE CAN'T BLOCK.
39,00:01:43.62,00:01:43.62,THE ONLY THING SHE CAN DO IS JUST TAKE IT
40,00:01:45.25,00:01:45.25,AND TAKE IT AND TAKE IT AND TAKE IT.
41,00:01:46.58,00:01:46.58,"AND I THINK SHE DID WELL,"
42,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,"BECAUSE IF THE SHOE WAS ON THE OTHER FOOT AND IT WAS ME,"
43,00:01:49.88,00:01:49.88,I WOULD HAVE WENT RIGHT BACK AT HIM
44,00:01:51.21,00:01:51.21,"AND HIT HIM REALLY, REALLY, HARD."
45,00:01:59.29,00:01:59.29,>> THAT'S JUST HOW HE IS.
46,00:02:01.29,00:02:01.29,>> YEAH.
47,00:02:03.29,00:02:03.29,>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
48,00:02:05.88,00:02:05.88,">> WELL, WAIT TILL HE ATTACKS YOU, HONEY."
49,00:02:08.12,00:02:08.12,>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
50,00:02:11.00,00:02:11.00,>> THE JACKASS NAMED MR. FARTY--
51,00:02:12.62,00:02:12.62,"IS GONNA BE HIS NAME FROM NOW ON, INSTEAD OF ""MARTY,"""
52,00:02:16.17,00:02:16.17,IN MY BOOK--
53,00:02:17.21,00:02:17.21,IS A JACKASS TO TRY TO ATTACK ME.
54,00:02:24.46,00:02:24.46,"I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK HE CAN BEAT ME PHYSICALLY,"
55,00:02:27.12,00:02:27.12,MUCH LESS MENTALLY.
56,00:02:28.75,00:02:28.75,"I'M STILL GOING TO PLAY MY GAME THE WAY I'M PLAYING IT,"
57,00:02:31.21,00:02:31.21,BUT I THINK HE'S GRASPING AT STRAWS
58,00:02:33.17,00:02:33.17,BECAUSE HE KNOWS HIS DAYS ARE NUMBERED.
59,00:02:36.67,00:02:36.67,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
60,00:03:07.75,00:03:07.75,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
61,00:03:27.21,00:03:27.21,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
62,00:03:37.08,00:03:37.08,>> DO YOU THINK IT WAS CHASE THAT PUT MY NAME DOWN?
63,00:03:39.17,00:03:39.17,NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS BUT IT'S JUST GOOD TO KNOW.
64,00:03:41.08,00:03:41.08,"DO YOU THINK IT WAS CHASE, OR DO YOU THINK IT WAS HOLLY?"
65,00:03:42.92,00:03:42.92,>> I THINK IT WAS HOLLY.
66,00:03:44.21,00:03:44.21,">> OKAY, THEN, THAT TELLS ME"
67,00:03:46.58,00:03:46.58,THAT CHASE HAS GOT MAYBE HALF A BRAIN.
68,00:03:50.04,00:03:50.04,"IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING TO PLAY A GAME WITH PEOPLE,"
69,00:03:53.00,00:03:53.00,SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST STUPID.
70,00:03:54.88,00:03:54.88,I FEEL LIKE I CLEARED THE AIR LAST NIGHT.
71,00:03:57.54,00:03:57.54,"I WAS VERY, VERY CRYSTAL CLEAR"
72,00:03:59.38,00:03:59.38,THAT I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERESTIMATES
73,00:04:01.12,00:04:01.12,HOW DANGEROUS JANE IS IN THIS GAME.
74,00:04:04.00,00:04:04.00,BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT I'M POTENTIALLY IN TROUBLE HERE.
75,00:04:07.21,00:04:07.21,I'VE GOT A BIG TARGET ON MY BACK
76,00:04:08.83,00:04:08.83,SO I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO HAVE A BUTTON-DOWN PLAN
77,00:04:11.54,00:04:11.54,BETWEEN NOW AND NEXT TRIBAL
78,00:04:13.46,00:04:13.46,OR THEY WILL ELIMINATE ME IN A HEARTBEAT.
79,00:05:11.17,00:05:11.17,>> MARTY WAS TRYING TO POISON EVERYBODY'S OPINION OF ME
80,00:05:15.83,00:05:15.83,BECAUSE HE KNOWS THERE'S NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK.
81,00:05:19.21,00:05:19.21,HE'S JUST WAITING FOR THE HATCHET MAN TO CUT THAT ROPE
82,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,AND HE'S GOING TO BE HUNG.
83,00:05:24.08,00:05:24.08,"I'M TELLING YOU, THE MAN SCRAMBLES"
84,00:05:25.88,00:05:25.88,LIKE NOBODY I'VE EVER SEEN.
85,00:05:27.83,00:05:27.83,I MIGHT TAKE HIM TO THE WOOD SHED AND WHIP HIS ASS.
86,00:05:42.29,00:05:42.29,">> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!"
87,00:05:53.50,00:05:53.50,"ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?"
88,00:05:56.08,00:05:56.08,>> YES.
89,00:05:57.08,00:05:57.08,>> ABSOLUTELY!
90,00:05:58.08,00:05:58.08,">> Jeff: FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,"
91,00:05:59.25,00:05:59.25,YOU WILL BE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO TEAMS.
92,00:06:02.21,00:06:02.21,"ON MY GO, YOU'LL MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH A SERIES OF OBSTACLES"
93,00:06:06.21,00:06:06.21,WORKING TOGETHER TO COLLECT THREE KEYS.
94,00:06:11.04,00:06:11.04,"ONCE YOU'VE CLEARED ALL THE OBSTACLES,"
95,00:06:13.08,00:06:13.08,YOU WILL USE THE THREE KEYS TO OPEN THREE LOCKS.
96,00:06:16.33,00:06:16.33,FIRST TEAM TO RAISE THEIR FLAG WINS REWARD.
97,00:06:20.29,00:06:20.29,WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING FOR?
98,00:06:21.71,00:06:21.71,>> YES!
99,00:06:23.25,00:06:23.25,>> Jeff: THE WINNING TEAM WILL BE TAKEN TO A BEAUTIFUL SPOT
100,00:06:25.25,00:06:25.25,WHERE YOU WILL ENJOY A CANOPY TOUR.
101,00:06:27.71,00:06:27.71,"YOU'LL ZIPLINE ACROSS THE TREETOPS,"
102,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,EXPERIENCING NICARAGUA IN A WHOLE NEW WAY.
103,00:06:32.92,00:06:32.92,"WHEN THE TOUR IS OVER, YOU'LL TREAT YOURSELVES"
104,00:06:35.17,00:06:35.17,TO A SURVIVOR BARBECUE:
105,00:06:37.67,00:06:37.67,"CHICKEN, STEAK, POTATO CHIPS, APPLE PIE."
106,00:06:42.88,00:06:42.88,>> APPLE PIE!
107,00:06:44.17,00:06:44.17,>> Jeff: SOFT DRINKS AND COLD BEER.
108,00:06:46.17,00:06:46.17,WORTH PLAYING FOR?
109,00:06:47.38,00:06:47.38,>> YES!
110,00:06:48.75,00:06:48.75,>> Jeff: WE'LL DRAW FOR TEAMS AND GET STARTED.
111,00:06:54.46,00:06:54.46,"ALL RIGHT, WE RANDOMLY DREW FOR TEAMS, AND AMAZINGLY,"
112,00:06:58.08,00:06:58.08,WE ENDED UP WITH MEN VERSUS WOMEN.
113,00:07:01.54,00:07:01.54,"BECAUSE WE HAVE 11 PEOPLE, ONE OF YOU WAS NOT SELECTED."
114,00:07:04.12,00:07:04.12,"CHASE, YOU WILL NOT RUN IN THIS CHALLENGE,"
115,00:07:06.88,00:07:06.88,BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE OUT OF IT.
116,00:07:08.42,00:07:08.42,YOU'RE GOING TO CHOOSE ONE TEAM TO BACK.
117,00:07:10.96,00:07:10.96,"IF YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT TEAM AND THEY WIN, YOU GO ON REWARD."
118,00:07:13.58,00:07:13.58,"OTHERWISE, YOU HEAD BACK TO CAMP WITH THE LOSERS."
119,00:07:17.33,00:07:17.33,>> CHASE!
120,00:07:19.17,00:07:19.17,>> I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING CRAZY AND GO WITH THE GIRLS.
121,00:07:23.96,00:07:23.96,">> Jeff: CHASE, TAKE A SPOT AT THE END OF THE RACE."
122,00:07:28.29,00:07:28.29,"ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO."

298,00:15:37.46,00:15:37.46,IT WILL DEFINITELY RUFFLE A FEW FEATHERS.

316,00:16:18.50,00:16:18.50,BUT I BELIEVE BRENDA AND I ARE THE TWO BRIGHTEST MINDS OUT HERE
317,00:16:21.83,00:16:21.83,AND IN THE END SHE AND I HAVE THE POWER
318,00:16:24.79,00:16:24.79,TO SEND WHOEVER WE WANT HOME.
319,00:16:34.71,00:16:34.71,>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE WITH US.

324,00:16:44.62,00:16:44.62,">> MARTY, YOU ALL KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM."
325,00:16:46.71,00:16:46.71,SASH IS THE ONLY ONE I TRUST OVER THERE SO...
326,00:16:48.42,00:16:48.42,>> THANK YOU.
327,00:16:49.46,00:16:49.46,>> WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
328,00:16:52.08,00:16:52.08,">> CHASE, I DON'T THINK HE MADE A SMART MOVE."
329,00:16:54.79,00:16:54.79,HE SHOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE GUYS.
330,00:16:57.04,00:16:57.04,"HE JUST WENT WITH HIS LITTLE EMOTIONS,"
331,00:17:00.38,00:17:00.38,"AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT NORTH CAROLINA, JANE, AND MOMMY"

333,00:17:08.21,00:17:08.21,SO HE WENT WITH THE GIRLS.
334,00:17:10.08,00:17:10.08,CHASE DOESN'T MAKE SMART MOVES.
335,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.
336,00:17:14.29,00:17:14.29,>> ISN'T THAT CRAZY?
337,00:17:15.42,00:17:15.42,THE ALLIANCE PICKED THE SAME ROCKS.
338,00:17:17.25,00:17:17.25,>> AND I THINK TOMORROW WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT
339,00:17:20.50,00:17:20.50,ABOUT ONE THING-- AS LONG AS MARTY IS NOT WINNING
340,00:17:22.71,00:17:22.71,"IMMUNITY TOMORROW, HE'S GOING HOME."
341,00:17:24.79,00:17:24.79,>> I REALLY WANT MARTY OUT OF HERE.

343,00:17:28.21,00:17:28.21,IT DROVE ME CRAZY.
344,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,I MEAN-- THAT I MISSED THAT.
345,00:17:30.92,00:17:30.92,"BUT I WENT WITH MY GUT, AND I WANTED TO SHOW THE GIRLS"
346,00:17:33.25,00:17:33.25,"THEY CAN TRUST ME, AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GET ME"
347,00:17:36.00,00:17:36.00,FURTHER IN THE GAME.
348,00:17:39.12,00:17:39.12,">> DAN AND MARTY ARE REALLY, REALLY TIGHT."
349,00:17:40.96,00:17:40.96,>> I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW TIGHT THEY WERE.

351,00:17:45.12,00:17:45.12,I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO GET SASH AND BRENDA.
352,00:17:47.00,00:17:47.00,">> YEAH, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SIT THERE AND DOUBT BRENDA"
353,00:17:49.38,00:17:49.38,BECAUSE THAT WILL GET HER MAD AND WE DON'T WANT HER MAD.
354,00:17:52.50,00:17:52.50,HOPEFULLY BRENDA'S IN.
355,00:17:59.75,00:17:59.75,>> GOTTA TRUST HER.
356,00:18:01.21,00:18:01.21,THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.

362,00:18:17.79,00:18:17.79,>> OKAY.
363,00:18:19.29,00:18:19.29,>> YOU REALLY THINK WE CAN TRUST BRENDA.
364,00:18:21.00,00:18:21.00,>> YEAH. >> I DO.
365,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,">> I MEAN, WE MADE IT THIS FAR WITH HER."
366,00:18:23.58,00:18:23.58,>> YEAH.
367,00:18:24.96,00:18:24.96,MY RELATIONSHIP WITH BRENDA HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED.
368,00:18:26.62,00:18:26.62,I'M NOT SURE ABOUT BRENDA.
369,00:18:28.12,00:18:28.12,I'M NOT SURE WHERE HER HEAD'S AT RIGHT NOW.
370,00:18:29.54,00:18:29.54,WE'VE BEEN AWAY FROM EACH OTHER SINCE WE DID THE TRIBAL SWAP.
371,00:18:32.58,00:18:32.58,WE DON'T TALK MUCH ANYMORE.
372,00:18:35.00,00:18:35.00,WE TALKED WHEN WE WERE AT THE LA FLOR CAMP
373,00:18:36.92,00:18:36.92,BUT WE DON'T TALK MUCH.
374,00:18:39.46,00:18:39.46,THAT COULD BE BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY WITH MARTY.
375,00:18:41.71,00:18:41.71,YOU DON'T GOT TO WORRY ABOUT BRENDA.
376,00:18:46.38,00:18:46.38,>> JUST DON'T GET ON HER NERVES.
377,00:18:50.12,00:18:50.12,>> YOU SEEM REALLY UNSURE RIGHT NOW.

383,00:19:04.96,00:19:04.96,YOU SEEM REALLY UNSURE.
384,00:19:06.12,00:19:06.12,>> NO.
385,00:19:10.46,00:19:10.46,>> YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST ME.

395,00:19:30.00,00:19:30.00,>> YOU SEEM REALLY UNSURE RIGHT NOW ABOUT EVERYTHING.
396,00:19:34.38,00:19:34.38,>> I DON'T REALLY LOOK INTO THE FUTURE THAT MUCH.

398,00:19:39.54,00:19:39.54,AND CHASE IS TOO PARANOID.

602,00:29:59.38,00:29:59.38,>> NO? OKAY.
603,00:30:00.62,00:30:00.62,>> WHAT'S THE PLAN? DID SASHA JUST TELL ME?
604,00:30:02.29,00:30:02.29,">> SASH'S PLAN WAS, YEAH, HE'LL LAY OUT THE WHOLE THING."
605,00:30:04.42,00:30:04.42,"WAS BASICALLY EVERYONE SAY NAONKA, NAONKA, NAONKA,"
606,00:30:06.08,00:30:06.08,FLUSH THE IDOL AND VOTE JANE OFF.
607,00:30:08.42,00:30:08.42,BLINDSIDE JANE. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE...
608,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,"THAT'S WHAT SASH PROPOSED,"
609,00:30:13.71,00:30:13.71,AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE ON BOARD WITH THAT.
610,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,"AT LEAST, LIKE, FIVE,"
611,00:30:17.58,00:30:17.58,OR WHOEVER ALL OF US VOTED LAST TIME.
612,00:30:19.38,00:30:19.38,>> OKAY. WHAT MARTY SAID IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
613,00:30:21.25,00:30:21.25,"JANE IS A HUGE THREAT,"
614,00:30:22.62,00:30:22.62,AND IF ANYBODY'S THINKING OF GOING WITH HER TO THE FINAL
615,00:30:25.12,00:30:25.12,"OR LETTING HER EVEN GET CLOSE IS A FOOL, 'CAUSE SHE WOULD WIN."
616,00:30:28.29,00:30:28.29,>> I ALWAYS PACK MY BAGS AS IF I MIGHT GO.
617,00:30:30.58,00:30:30.58,">> I KNOW, ME, TOO."
618,00:30:32.17,00:30:32.17,">> AND I'M NOT GOING TO, I MEAN, I'M GOING TO TONIGHT."
619,00:30:34.54,00:30:34.54,"HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE, ALL RIGHT?"
620,00:30:36.29,00:30:36.29,>> I AGREED TO IT.
621,00:30:37.58,00:30:37.58,"WE WENT ALONG WITH THE PLAN, BUT MARTY IS NOT RUNNING THE CAMP."
622,00:30:40.38,00:30:40.38,SASH AND I ARE RUNNING THE CAMP.
623,00:30:47.12,00:30:47.12,>> DID MARTY FILL YOU IN ON HIS PLAN?
624,00:30:49.21,00:30:49.21,>> YEAH. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
625,00:30:50.42,00:30:50.42,>> HUH?
626,00:30:51.58,00:30:51.58,>> WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
627,00:30:52.88,00:30:52.88,>> MY PLAN IS WHATEVER YOUR PLAN IS.
628,00:30:55.29,00:30:55.29,">> ALL RIGHT, GOOD."
629,00:30:56.38,00:30:56.38,>> I ASSUMED GO AHEAD WITH...
630,00:30:59.17,00:30:59.17,>> TELLING EVERYBODY NAONKA.
631,00:31:01.38,00:31:01.38,>> NAONKA. I THOUGHT ALL THE WOMEN WANTED MARTY GONE.
632,00:31:06.08,00:31:06.08,>> MARTY GONE. THEY DO.
633,00:31:08.25,00:31:08.25,">> THEY WANT HIM OUT SO BAD, THAT I FEEL LIKE..."
634,00:31:11.42,00:31:11.42,JUST LIKE A THORN IN THEIR SIDE.
635,00:31:13.17,00:31:13.17,>> JUST DON'T...
636,00:31:15.17,00:31:15.17,">> HERE, LET'S CHAT FOR A SECOND."
637,00:31:16.67,00:31:16.67,">> I JUST DON'T LIKE HOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW,"
638,00:31:20.12,00:31:20.12,JANE AND HOLLY AND CHASE'S CLIQUE ARE DEMANDING THINGS.
639,00:31:25.33,00:31:25.33,>> RIGHT. YEAH.
640,00:31:27.08,00:31:27.08,YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
641,00:31:28.46,00:31:28.46,">> OKAY, SO IF WE TAKE OUT MARTY,"
642,00:31:30.25,00:31:30.25,"I'M FINE WITH WHOEVER, RIGHT."
643,00:31:31.50,00:31:31.50,">> JUST PERSONALLY FOR ME, I WOULD RATHER THAT MARTY STAY"
644,00:31:34.42,00:31:34.42,ONE OR TWO TIMES LONGER AT LEAST
645,00:31:36.29,00:31:36.29,BECAUSE I THINK HE'S A GOOD COOK.
646,00:31:37.79,00:31:37.79,>> RIGHT.
647,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,">> I KNOW, HE TELLS ME EVERYTHING."
648,00:31:40.62,00:31:40.62,>> AND HE TELLS US EVERYTHING.
649,00:31:42.12,00:31:42.12,">> YEAH. SO, IDEALLY, LIKE, JUST FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT,"
650,00:31:46.00,00:31:46.00,I WOULDN'T WANT MARTY TO GO HOME TONIGHT.
651,00:31:47.92,00:31:47.92,">> ME, NEITHER."
652,00:31:49.21,00:31:49.21,>> SASH AND I ARE KIND OF LIKE THE SWING VOTE.
653,00:31:51.88,00:31:51.88,THE MARTY CREW THINKS WE'RE WITH THEM TO BLINDSIDE JANE
654,00:31:56.08,00:31:56.08,AND HAVE NAONKA FLUSH OUT HER IDOL.
655,00:31:58.29,00:31:58.29,AND THEN THE JANE-CHASE CREW THINKS WE'RE WITH THEM
656,00:32:01.08,00:32:01.08,TO VOTE OUT MARTY.
657,00:32:03.12,00:32:03.12,SO TONIGHT IS REALLY GONNA SHOW WHO WE REALLY ARE WITH.
658,00:32:05.79,00:32:05.79,"I LIKE TO BE IN CHARGE, AND I KIND OF AM IN CHARGE RIGHT NOW."
659,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,"SO WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,"
660,00:32:10.67,00:32:10.67,IT'S REALLY WHATEVER SASH AND I WANT.
661,00:32:25.21,00:32:25.21,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY.
662,00:32:32.04,00:32:32.04,"ALINA, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL."
663,00:32:41.83,00:32:41.83,SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REWARD CHALLENGE.
664,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,WE ENDED UP WITH THIS RANDOM SPLIT OF MEN VERSUS WOMEN.
665,00:32:48.00,00:32:48.00,"JANE, YOU GUYS WERE HEAVILY OUTMATCHED"
666,00:32:50.12,00:32:50.12,"IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL STRENGTH,"
667,00:32:51.92,00:32:51.92,AND YET YOU PUT UP A GREAT EFFORT.
668,00:32:54.79,00:32:54.79,">> THE HARDEST THING WAS WHEN WE HIT THE BAMBOO,"
669,00:32:57.17,00:32:57.17,"IT WAS LIKE WE BOUNCED OFF,"
670,00:32:58.96,00:32:58.96,"AND THEN WHEN WE HIT THE BRICK WALL,"
671,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,WE BOUNCED OFF EVEN HARDER.
672,00:33:02.62,00:33:02.62,">> Jeff: SASH, ON THE FLIP SIDE, THE GUYS WIN,"
673,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,YOU GET THIS GREAT REWARD.
674,00:33:07.08,00:33:07.08,WAS THERE A LITTLE BONDING TIME OR WAS IT ALL STRATEGY?
675,00:33:10.21,00:33:10.21,>> THERE WAS A LOT OF BONDING TIME.
676,00:33:11.96,00:33:11.96,I THINK THE FIVE OF US NOT ONLY SHOWED OUR DESIRE
677,00:33:15.25,00:33:15.25,TO WORK AS A GROUP AND ALSO GIVE US A LITTLE TIME AWAY
678,00:33:18.17,00:33:18.17,FROM THE CAMP TO STRATEGIZE AND DECIDE SOME OF THE NEXT STEPS.
679,00:33:22.38,00:33:22.38,">> Jeff: FABIO, THE DOWNSIDE OF BEING WITH ALL THE GUYS"
680,00:33:25.33,00:33:25.33,OUT ENJOYING THE REWARD IS YOU GOT FIVE WOMEN BACK AT CAMP
681,00:33:28.12,00:33:28.12,NONE TOO PLEASED ABOUT IT.
682,00:33:30.42,00:33:30.42,">> YEAH, I'M SURE"
683,00:33:32.08,00:33:32.08,"THAT STRATEGIZING DEFINITELY HAPPENED,"
684,00:33:33.50,00:33:33.50,"AND IT WAS THE FIVE GIRLS PLUS CHASE, SO THAT'S SIX PEOPLE."
685,00:33:36.62,00:33:36.62,"I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANGLES HERE."
686,00:33:38.79,00:33:38.79,I WAS JUST STOKED THAT WE WERE EATING WHILE WE WERE DOING IT.
687,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,">> Jeff: MARTY, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL YOU WERE PRETTY CLEAR"
688,00:33:45.12,00:33:45.12,ABOUT JANE IS SOMEBODY YOU NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR
689,00:33:47.50,00:33:47.50,AND YOU PROBABLY OUGHT TO GET RID OF.
690,00:33:49.33,00:33:49.33,FELT LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE PUT A TARGET ON YOUR BACK.
691,00:33:51.75,00:33:51.75,>> SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE THREAT.
692,00:33:53.12,00:33:53.12,"WHICH IS, AGAIN, I'LL SAY IT, I'M HONEST,"
693,00:33:54.96,00:33:54.96,"IT'S A COMPLIMENT TO JANE,"
694,00:33:56.46,00:33:56.46,AND MAYBE YOU TAKE SOME RISK IN DOING THAT.
695,00:33:59.46,00:33:59.46,"I FEEL FAIRLY COMFORTABLE, BUT MY BAGS ARE PACKED."
696,00:34:02.08,00:34:02.08,">> Jeff: BRENDA, HOW MUCH TIME DID YOU SPEND THINKING ABOUT"
697,00:34:05.12,00:34:05.12,WHAT MARTY SAID ABOUT JANE?
698,00:34:06.79,00:34:06.79,>> YOU CAN'T LIE AGAINST THAT AND SAY SHE'S NOT A THREAT.
699,00:34:09.92,00:34:09.92,IT'S TRUE.
700,00:34:10.92,00:34:10.92,"I MEAN, TAKE SOMEONE LIKE NAONKA"
701,00:34:12.21,00:34:12.21,"WHO'S, LIKE, ""TROUBLEMAKER,"""
702,00:34:13.62,00:34:13.62,"OR TAKE SOMEONE LIKE JANE WHO KEEPS FEEDING US FISH,"
703,00:34:15.88,00:34:15.88,WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE TO THE END?
704,00:34:18.29,00:34:18.29,"I THINK IT'S A NO-BRAINER,"
705,00:34:19.46,00:34:19.46,DEPENDING ON HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME.
706,00:34:21.46,00:34:21.46,">> Jeff: SO, JANE, YOU ARE A LIKABLE PERSON,"
707,00:34:24.42,00:34:24.42,AND IN SOME GAME THAT WOULD BE REWARDED.
708,00:34:27.12,00:34:27.12,"SOMETIMES IN SURVIVOR,  YOU GET PENALIZED."
709,00:34:29.75,00:34:29.75,">> WELL, YOU ALWAYS HAVE A TARGET ON YOUR BACK."
710,00:34:30.88,00:34:30.88,ME AND MARTY GOT OFF TO A BAD START.
711,00:34:32.96,00:34:32.96,"I STEPPED ON HIS TOES, HE STEPPED ON MINE."
712,00:34:35.67,00:34:35.67,I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT.
713,00:34:37.88,00:34:37.88,"SO I THINK I HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK, YEAH."
714,00:34:41.62,00:34:41.62,">> Jeff: NAONKA, AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WE TALKED ABOUT"
715,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,THE FACT THAT YOU HAD AN IDEA TO STEAL SOME OF THE FOOD
716,00:34:47.04,00:34:47.04,FROM THE MERGE FEAST.
717,00:34:48.33,00:34:48.33,WHY ARE YOU RUBBING YOUR HEAD ALREADY?
718,00:34:50.33,00:34:50.33,">> I DON'T, JEFF. GO AHEAD."
719,00:34:53.12,00:34:53.12,">> Jeff: IT CAME UP AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, NAONKA."
720,00:34:55.12,00:34:55.12,YOU SURVIVED THAT VOTE.
721,00:34:56.21,00:34:56.21,"IN FACT, IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HURT YOU AT ALL."
722,00:34:58.50,00:34:58.50,>> IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING
723,00:34:59.67,00:34:59.67,THAT'S GONNA ALWAYS BE TALKED ABOUT
724,00:35:01.12,00:35:01.12,"'CAUSE IT WAS STUPID, YOU KNOW? AND I'M HERE."
725,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
726,00:35:05.08,00:35:05.08,"I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE, JEFF,"
727,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,BUT I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE BROUGHT UP.
728,00:35:09.12,00:35:09.12,>> IT HAS NOT SIT WELL.
729,00:35:10.42,00:35:10.42,THE WAY IT WAS DEALT WITH AT THE LAST TRIBAL
730,00:35:12.79,00:35:12.79,WAS AS IF IT WAS TRIVIAL.
731,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,TO LIE AND TO TAKE FOOD-- THERE IS NO BIGGER SIN.
732,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,"I MEAN, I KNOW THERE WERE PRIORITIES HERE"
733,00:35:19.29,00:35:19.29,"AND SOME OF US HAD TO GO WITH THE FLOW,"
734,00:35:22.08,00:35:22.08,"BUT ABSOLUTELY NOT TRIVIAL, NOT IN ANY WAY."
735,00:35:24.17,00:35:24.17,">> JEFF, I'M NOT PERFECT. I'M A HUMANITARIAN."
736,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,"I'M A HUMAN. I SCREW UP. MARTY SCREWS UP, TOO."
737,00:35:30.50,00:35:30.50,"BUT I DON'T LIKE HIM, HE DON'T LIKE ME."
738,00:35:32.62,00:35:32.62,SO IT IS WHAT IT IS.
739,00:35:34.25,00:35:34.25,>> Jeff: SO YOU'RE MAD AT MARTY 'CAUSE HE STRATEGIZES?
740,00:35:36.21,00:35:36.21,>> I DON'T LIKE HIM! I JUST DON'T.
741,00:35:39.96,00:35:39.96,"HIS HAIR, HIS WALK SUCKS."
742,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,"YOU KNOW, I CAN SEE THROUGH MARTY."
743,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,">> LIKE MARTY SAID, WE..."
744,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,">> FABIO, WAIT A MINUTE."
745,00:35:49.29,00:35:49.29,"YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HATE ON HIS GAME,"
746,00:35:51.62,00:35:51.62,BUT I'M COMPETING AGAINST MARTY.
747,00:35:52.83,00:35:52.83,PUT IT IN TERMS OF A TRACK MEET:
748,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,HE'S IN LANE 5 AND I'M IN LANE 4.
749,00:35:56.67,00:35:56.67,"I'M GONNA TRY TO GO A LITTLE FASTER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,"
750,00:35:59.54,00:35:59.54,"BEFORE I GO, YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA TRY TO GIVE MYSELF FIGHT."
751,00:36:02.25,00:36:02.25,"I'm GONNA TRY TO JUST WHOO-WHOO-WHOO, YOU KNOW?"
752,00:36:03.79,00:36:03.79,"TRY TO SCARE HIM A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW?"
753,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,'CAUSE THAT'S JUST WHAT YOU DO.
754,00:36:07.04,00:36:07.04,">> I DON'T FOLLOW THAT, BUT, WHATEVER."
755,00:36:10.54,00:36:10.54,">> Jeff: IS IT WORKING, MARTY?"
756,00:36:12.08,00:36:12.08,">> NO. I MEAN, THIS GAME IS ABOUT INSTINCTS,"
757,00:36:15.42,00:36:15.42,AND I HAD A GUT INSTINCT THAT SAID
758,00:36:18.08,00:36:18.08,THAT'S WHAT THIS PERSON IS ALL ABOUT.
759,00:36:20.04,00:36:20.04,">> THANK YOU, THANK YOU."
760,00:36:21.04,00:36:21.04,>> AND GUESS WHAT?
761,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,SHE IS A LIAR AND A CHEAT AND A STEAL.
762,00:36:24.21,00:36:24.21,">> WELL, MY DADDY IS IN INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA,"
763,00:36:26.12,00:36:26.12,AND I DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO PROVE TO MARTY.
764,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,">> HE'S NOT GONNA BE PROUD OF YOU, SISTER."
765,00:36:30.79,00:36:30.79,">> OH, HE IS BECAUSE I'M HERE AND YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE."
766,00:36:33.79,00:36:33.79,(LIGHT LAUGHTER)
767,00:36:36.21,00:36:36.21,">> Jeff: FABIO, YOU LOVE THIS."
768,00:36:38.54,00:36:38.54,">> IT'S CRAZY. LIKE, EVERYTHING SHE JUST TALKED ABOUT"
769,00:36:41.04,00:36:41.04,DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO ME.
770,00:36:43.00,00:36:43.00,>> I WANT YOU GUYS TO KNOW I'M NOT DUMB.
771,00:36:45.12,00:36:45.12,"YOU KNOW, I MADE A STUPID MOVE,"
772,00:36:47.29,00:36:47.29,"BUT I'M VERY FAR FROM STUPID, OKAY?"
773,00:36:49.21,00:36:49.21,">> AND BY THE WAY, JUST SAYING YOU'RE SORRY,"
774,00:36:50.92,00:36:50.92,YOU STILL DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
775,00:36:52.58,00:36:52.58,">> OKAY, WELL, IT'S DONE."
776,00:36:54.04,00:36:54.04,">> OKAY, THEN NOTHING ELSE NEEDS TO BE SAID ABOUT IT."
777,00:36:56.25,00:36:56.25,YOU'RE PROVING OUR POINT.
778,00:36:57.42,00:36:57.42,">> OKAY, YOU GUYS KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE DAMN FLOUR."
779,00:36:59.42,00:36:59.42,WHAT THE ... WOULD YOU WANT ME TO DO?
780,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,YOU GUYS CAN BASH ON ME ALL YOU WANT.
781,00:37:03.38,00:37:03.38,I'M NOT GONNA LOSE ANY SLEEP
782,00:37:04.71,00:37:04.71,BECAUSE I DAMN SURE DON'T GET SLEEP AS IT.
783,00:37:06.92,00:37:06.92,>> YOU MIGHT TONIGHT.
784,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,">> AND YOU MIGHT, TOO, MARTY."
785,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,>> ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY.
786,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,>> BOTH: MM-HMM.
787,00:37:12.25,00:37:12.25,>> THIS IS CRAZY!
788,00:37:14.33,00:37:14.33,">> THEY THINK THAT THEY'RE INTIMIDATING ME RIGHT NOW,"
789,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,AND THEY'RE NOT.
