122,00:07:08.58,00:07:08.58,almost a half a pound of meat.That's more meat
123,00:07:11.08,00:07:11.08,than we've had at any meal.>> Mm-mm.
124,00:07:16.38,00:07:16.38,>> So we just kind of set thebig clamshells out by the shore.

208,00:11:18.92,00:11:18.92,supplies and goods to devour.We really need it.
209,00:11:23.62,00:11:23.62,We could use the foodand we could use

229,00:12:21.08,00:12:21.08,So I'm not underestimatingthem one bit.
230,00:12:23.21,00:12:23.21,So far it seems like they havea lot of smart people.
231,00:12:25.71,00:12:25.71,So we're just going to seeif work can overtake smartness

245,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,Caryn is a hard worker andthen Gregg's got the muscle.

253,00:13:28.58,00:13:28.58,which just getting our materialsthere was a lot of work.

257,00:13:42.17,00:13:42.17,and we're working in the sunbecause we want to be

259,00:13:50.38,00:13:50.38,"A boat in the water, right?We don't have a beach."
260,00:13:52.96,00:13:52.96,It's a problem.It's nerve-racking.

265,00:14:07.54,00:14:07.54,And I don't like the position.There's a lot of apprehension

267,00:14:19.25,00:14:19.25,to get as much attentionfrom above as possible.
268,00:14:23.21,00:14:23.21,So we're using bambooand coconut

273,00:14:39.21,00:14:39.21,We're gonna see if the ropesoaked in kerosene works.
274,00:14:42.25,00:14:42.25,I think that would be a greatthing if we can use that
275,00:14:43.88,00:14:43.88,because that would be somethingthey wouldn't have.

307,00:16:49.67,00:16:49.67,And almost their whole planwas fire.
308,00:16:51.96,00:16:51.96,"So my fear, I think, might havecome to truth"
309,00:16:53.92,00:16:53.92,that I don't know if they gotthe fire lit.

379,00:21:35.29,00:21:35.29,So I'm making a conscious effortto play things cool.
380,00:21:44.42,00:21:44.42,Jenn felt I was just startingto be kind of standoffish.
381,00:21:47.17,00:21:47.17,"Because we hadyou know, kicked things off"
382,00:21:49.62,00:21:49.62,really welland it was kind of exciting.
383,00:21:51.29,00:21:51.29,But then you kind of get intothe context of the game
384,00:21:53.46,00:21:53.46,"and realize, you know,that's your priority."
385,00:21:59.17,00:21:59.17,>> Mm-hmm.I like Gregg a lot
386,00:22:05.92,00:22:05.92,and I think he likes me a lot.But Gregg is very intensely
387,00:22:09.62,00:22:09.62,focused on this game.It's all he can think about.
388,00:22:13.29,00:22:13.29,"So there have been dayswhere he's very off to me,"
389,00:22:16.17,00:22:16.17,"and it's been kind of strange.You know, until we spoke,"
390,00:22:19.42,00:22:19.42,I didn't knowwhat was going on.
391,00:22:21.04,00:22:21.04,"You know, I didn't know if hewas still, if he was still"
392,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,"in the same place,if we're just going"
393,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,"to be that alliance,but there is still"
394,00:22:27.25,00:22:27.25,a romantic connection.It's still there.
395,00:22:28.58,00:22:28.58,"We'll just see if he can,he can loosen up a bit."
396,00:22:35.92,00:22:35.92,">> I'm concerned with Greggand Jenn because they are tight,"
397,00:22:40.12,00:22:40.12,you know?What is going to happen
398,00:22:42.58,00:22:42.58,when all of a suddenwe have to tell Gregg or Jenn
399,00:22:45.17,00:22:45.17,that the other onemay be getting voted off
400,00:22:47.42,00:22:47.42,that night?You're bringing in a whole
401,00:22:49.25,00:22:49.25,different volatile emotionthat is separate from this game.
402,00:22:54.08,00:22:54.08,"So, uh, I'm, I'm concerned.We're all watching"
403,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,the relationshipand seeing where
404,00:22:59.38,00:22:59.38,the alliances lie.The little romance or whatever
405,00:23:02.88,00:23:02.88,"they've got blossoming,it just could be"
406,00:23:04.71,00:23:04.71,a monkey wrenchthat we don't see coming.
407,00:23:29.21,00:23:29.21,>> Got a clam?>> Uh-huh.
408,00:23:31.21,00:23:31.21,">> Way to go, boy.>> Good job!"
409,00:23:36.17,00:23:36.17,>> Damn.>> Bobby Jon was able to catch
410,00:23:39.46,00:23:39.46,"a pretty large clam,and a nice little hand-sized"
411,00:23:41.79,00:23:41.79,"black fish.Oh, man, when he got that fish,"
412,00:23:45.38,00:23:45.38,"we were all super excited.>> Good, isn't it?"
413,00:23:48.88,00:23:48.88,">> Yeah.>> Well, we got something."
414,00:23:51.12,00:23:51.12,">> Yeah. Good job!>> Gosh, hitting that fish felt"
415,00:23:55.71,00:23:55.71,"like making an extra point,you know, to win the game"
416,00:23:58.00,00:23:58.00,"or something like that.I felt like, like I had scored,"
417,00:24:00.42,00:24:00.42,you know.It felt nice.
418,00:24:04.33,00:24:04.33,I think that fish done.>> I'm just going to try
419,00:24:08.88,00:24:08.88,to cut him up.>>  Finally we were able
420,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,to get some proteinin our bodies.
421,00:24:13.62,00:24:13.62,We ate the clam.We ate the fish and we ate
422,00:24:16.92,00:24:16.92,"I don't know how many pansof coconut, so, you know,"
423,00:24:19.62,00:24:19.62,"we got protein, we got carbs,we got everything."
424,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,>> I think it's pretty damngood.
425,00:24:23.58,00:24:23.58,">> Yeah.>> I mean, I feel the protein."
426,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,"The meal was good.I mean, it was nice to be full"
427,00:24:28.33,00:24:28.33,for a change.I definitely think the food
428,00:24:30.33,00:24:30.33,will help us in a challengeif we get one.
429,00:24:38.46,00:24:38.46,"Oh, cool.>> ""The way to lose this one"
430,00:24:41.92,00:24:41.92,"is to be just plain lazy.>> BOTH: ""Don't think you need"
431,00:24:45.08,00:24:45.08,"to practice?""Then you're just crazy."
432,00:24:47.25,00:24:47.25,">> ""To keep your tribe together,slot the pieces into place."
433,00:24:50.92,00:24:50.92,">> Got to heed this warning oryou could be out of the race."""
434,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,">> Yeah, immunity.That's supposed to be a star."
435,00:24:57.62,00:24:57.62,">> Yeah, it's supposedto look just like that."
436,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,"Okay, cool.Let's go sit down."
437,00:25:00.46,00:25:00.46,>> Let's go sit downand do it.

441,00:25:08.62,00:25:08.62,one of our tribe memberscould be going home.
442,00:25:11.08,00:25:11.08,"Sliding them around.This got to go up somehow,"
443,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,it's got to go...>> We always keep the faith.
444,00:25:16.88,00:25:16.88,We haven't won one yet.Maybe today will be different.
445,00:25:21.21,00:25:21.21,We're ready.We're full.
446,00:25:29.88,00:25:29.88,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys.What's going on, Koror?"

619,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,And I don't plan on going.And there's no reason
620,00:34:53.42,00:34:53.42,"for me to go.I mean, I'm thinking about doing"

622,00:35:06.79,00:35:06.79,And why leave it in his handswhen we could end it right now?
623,00:35:10.08,00:35:10.08,">> Yeah.>> But now he's, like,"
