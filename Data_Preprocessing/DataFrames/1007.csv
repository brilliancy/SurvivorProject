13,00:00:34.08,00:00:34.08,>> We win. We needed this to boost
14,00:00:35.79,00:00:35.79,"our spirits and morale, and basically,"
15,00:00:37.33,00:00:37.33,it was a whole new chapter for us.
16,00:00:39.67,00:00:39.67,Ready? >> PROBST: ...and enjoyed a

19,00:00:47.17,00:00:47.17,"It's just kind of like a euphoric type of feeling,"
20,00:00:48.96,00:00:48.96,and I just kind of wanted to cherish every second
21,00:00:51.04,00:00:51.04,'cause I was at a place in this world
22,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,"where I won't ever go again. >> PROBST: At Koror, a violent"
23,00:00:55.50,00:00:55.50,storm raged... >> You awake?
24,00:01:00.04,00:01:00.04,This isn't going to go anywhere. There's no way.

27,00:01:07.38,00:01:07.38,>> It is hard. >> And I'm so depleted.
28,00:01:10.29,00:01:10.29,>> Janu is losing it. She gets totally
29,00:01:12.21,00:01:12.21,caught up in her head And I think she's grating on
30,00:01:15.42,00:01:15.42,everybody's nerves a little bit. >> PROBST: At the immunity
31,00:01:17.46,00:01:17.46,"challenge... Koror has their rope undone,"
32,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,pulling it up. ...Ulong's comeback
33,00:01:22.04,00:01:22.04,proved to be only temporary. Koror wins their fifth straight
34,00:01:27.04,00:01:27.04,"immunity challenge! Back at camp,"
35,00:01:30.12,00:01:30.12,Stephenie and Bobby Jon hatched a plan to ensure their
36,00:01:32.83,00:01:32.83,safety at Tribal Council. >> I'll vote for James with you.
37,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,>> Right. >> That's only if you
38,00:01:37.21,00:01:37.21,"promise if the three of us are still here,"
39,00:01:39.17,00:01:39.17,"you and I go to the end. No, we'll go to the end."
40,00:01:42.00,00:01:42.00,And we'll vote Ib off. He wanted to make an alliance
41,00:01:44.33,00:01:44.33,with me that I vote for James tonight.
42,00:01:46.92,00:01:46.92,He wants to vote Ibrehem out next.
43,00:01:48.79,00:01:48.79,I really don't know where I stand right now.
44,00:01:51.96,00:01:51.96,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Stephenie voted for"
45,00:01:53.96,00:01:53.96,"Ibrehem, causing a tie vote. Two votes Ibrehem,"
46,00:01:57.04,00:01:57.04,"two votes James. Steph, Bobby Jon,"
47,00:01:59.96,00:01:59.96,you will vote. It's your last chance
48,00:02:02.96,00:02:02.96,to change your vote. But when the second round
49,00:02:04.79,00:02:04.79,"of votes came in, Stephenie had changed her vote."
50,00:02:07.58,00:02:07.58,The seventh person voted out of Survivor: Palau.
51,00:02:10.42,00:02:10.42,And James took the fall. Sorry.
52,00:02:14.08,00:02:14.08,"I had to. >> PROBST: James, the tribe has"
53,00:02:16.04,00:02:16.04,spoken. 11 are left.
54,00:02:19.08,00:02:19.08,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
55,00:02:59.42,00:02:59.42,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> How many people do they have?
56,00:03:54.71,00:03:54.71,Eight. And we're down to three.
57,00:03:57.62,00:03:57.62,"So they're still up in numbers, but"
58,00:03:59.58,00:03:59.58,"sometimes the best finish, you know?"
59,00:04:02.96,00:04:02.96,"The people in last always turn around,"
60,00:04:04.75,00:04:04.75,"like a second-half team, almost. I mean, it can happen."
61,00:04:07.67,00:04:07.67,"I mean, the odds aren't in our favor, but..."
62,00:04:11.08,00:04:11.08,">> I mean, it just feels weird. Like three people are left."
63,00:04:14.00,00:04:14.00,It feels like so long ago when we had nine.
64,00:04:16.75,00:04:16.75,"I'm really surprised. I mean, I thought I had"
65,00:04:21.17,00:04:21.17,"this all figured out, and now having our tribe, Ulong,"
66,00:04:23.50,00:04:23.50,lose every single immunity challenge--
67,00:04:25.25,00:04:25.25,"I'm completely shocked and surprised,"
68,00:04:27.33,00:04:27.33,"and I'm embarrassed. I wish we could have won,"
69,00:04:29.75,00:04:29.75,but everything happens for a reason.
70,00:04:31.54,00:04:31.54,I know I did the best I could. >> This is kind
71,00:04:34.38,00:04:34.38,"of weird, the situation. Have you ever spent this"
72,00:04:36.96,00:04:36.96,much time with people? >> No.
73,00:04:38.25,00:04:38.25,>> The same group of people? >> No.
74,00:04:39.92,00:04:39.92,">> Day in, day out. >> No. Not my boyfriend..."
75,00:04:42.71,00:04:42.71,>> That's what I'm saying. >> Not my fam...
76,00:04:44.46,00:04:44.46,not even people I love. >> It was definitely weird
77,00:04:47.04,00:04:47.04,trying to feel like a tribe when you're down
78,00:04:49.21,00:04:49.21,to three freakin' people. It does almost feel
79,00:04:51.54,00:04:51.54,almost like a group of friends rather than a tribe.
80,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,"If we had to go to Tribal again,"
81,00:04:55.88,00:04:55.88,"I think it would probably be very, very emotional."
82,00:04:58.17,00:04:58.17,">> Like, let's just bring on the merge."
83,00:05:00.17,00:05:00.17,Let's just do it. >> Yeah.
84,00:05:02.42,00:05:02.42,I have a feeling that that's going to happen.
85,00:05:05.08,00:05:05.08,">> We're down to three people, and Koror, they have eight,"
86,00:05:07.38,00:05:07.38,"and I don't know, maybe it's meant to happen like this."
87,00:05:09.79,00:05:09.79,"Maybe this is going to get me, Stephenie and Bobby"
88,00:05:12.08,00:05:12.08,further in the game than we expected.
89,00:05:13.58,00:05:13.58,"Maybe in some kind of weird way, this is gonna pan out and work"
90,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17,"out in a, in a good way for us. >> Yeah, I'm, I'm pretty, I'm"
91,00:05:23.29,00:05:23.29,happy with our decision last night.
92,00:05:25.12,00:05:25.12,">> I think it was right. I mean, you got"
93,00:05:27.21,00:05:27.21,"to make alliances some time or another,"
94,00:05:28.58,00:05:28.58,or you won't even... >> I know.
95,00:05:30.50,00:05:30.50,I think it's beneficial. Bobby Jon had
96,00:05:33.12,00:05:33.12,"approached me yesterday and said, you know, that"
97,00:05:34.88,00:05:34.88,"he thought that we could go far together as a team,"
98,00:05:37.08,00:05:37.08,and I feel that I can trust him a lot more than
99,00:05:40.08,00:05:40.08,I can trust Ibrehem. And I feel that we have
100,00:05:42.12,00:05:42.12,a strong alliance. Ib is a good...
101,00:05:43.96,00:05:43.96,"He's a good contender, too. I just don't see myself"
102,00:05:48.08,00:05:48.08,going real far with him. I just think that we're going
103,00:05:50.71,00:05:50.71,to be real safe together. I think we'll go far together.
104,00:05:53.88,00:05:53.88,>> Mm-hmm. You got to do
105,00:05:56.04,00:05:56.04,"what you got to do. >> I was going to say,"
106,00:06:12.96,00:06:12.96,do you see Tom doing crunches? >> It tried to eat me.
107,00:06:31.58,00:06:31.58,It could have. Be careful.
108,00:06:33.62,00:06:33.62,There's a lot of meat in there
109,00:06:35.12,00:06:35.12,>> Whoa. >> Holy cow.
110,00:06:37.12,00:06:37.12,>> Ian comes out with the biggest clam.
111,00:06:40.25,00:06:40.25,"It was like ""The Birth of Venus."""
112,00:06:41.38,00:06:41.38,It was the biggest clam you've ever seen.
113,00:06:43.00,00:06:43.00,You could stand inside of it. It seriously looked like it
114,00:06:45.17,00:06:45.17,weighed like a hundred pounds. >> It's probably older
115,00:06:46.96,00:06:46.96,"than you, Ian. >> Probably."
116,00:06:49.08,00:06:49.08,>> Older and heavier. >> One...
117,00:06:50.62,00:06:50.62,>> Get your hand in there. >> ...two...
118,00:06:53.08,00:06:53.08,"three! I got the clam, thinking,"
119,00:06:57.12,00:06:57.12,"""Okay, look at me,"" like keeping"
120,00:06:58.75,00:06:58.75,the role of the provider. >> Clambake.
121,00:07:03.04,00:07:03.04,">> Oh, yeah. >> I'd say we probably had"
122,00:07:05.79,00:07:05.79,"six or seven pounds of meat, so everybody had"
123,00:07:08.58,00:07:08.58,almost a half a pound of meat. That's more meat
124,00:07:11.08,00:07:11.08,than we've had at any meal. >> Mm-mm.
125,00:07:16.38,00:07:16.38,>> So we just kind of set the big clamshells out by the shore.
126,00:07:20.08,00:07:20.08,There was still a lot of blood left over from the clam.
127,00:07:22.92,00:07:22.92,So we were just kind of kicking it by the table.
128,00:07:25.25,00:07:25.25,">> And all of a sudden, somebody sees a shark."
129,00:07:30.25,00:07:30.25,">> Oh, there it is! That's not bad--"
130,00:07:31.92,00:07:31.92,"Right there. >> Ian and I both jumped,"
131,00:07:34.42,00:07:34.42,"grabbed the spears, and jumped in the water"
132,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,"ready to get him, and, and they're quick."
133,00:07:39.46,00:07:39.46,"You know, they take off right away."
134,00:07:41.42,00:07:41.42,Let's sit back for a bit and then run in.
135,00:07:47.88,00:07:47.88,>> Look at that one. >> Where?
136,00:07:50.75,00:07:50.75,">> Oh, dude. With the nail?"
137,00:07:52.54,00:07:52.54,I had to go to jump the boat and I cut my foot open.
138,00:07:55.42,00:07:55.42,"So I was kind of disabled. And then, everybody saw Tom"
139,00:07:58.54,00:07:58.54,"running down the beach. >> Tom, out of nowhere,"
140,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,he caught a shark. ( Gregg laughing )
141,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,>> How did you get it? >> I hit with it the machete
142,00:08:09.00,00:08:09.00,and cut it in half! Whoo!
143,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,( laughing ) Look at that!
144,00:08:14.96,00:08:14.96,How's that for a shot? Look at that!
145,00:08:20.21,00:08:20.21,">> Watch it, watch it, watch it. >> It was one of the most"
146,00:08:24.96,00:08:24.96,amazing things I've ever seen for-- especially
147,00:08:26.33,00:08:26.33,"for a, a city boy from, from New York."
148,00:08:28.50,00:08:28.50,>> And wham! >> He's a madman.
149,00:08:31.62,00:08:31.62,>> Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
150,00:08:34.29,00:08:34.29,Oh... is that me? >> How's that feel?
151,00:08:39.17,00:08:39.17,>> How did you get that? >> Whoo!
152,00:08:42.00,00:08:42.00,">> Oh, my God. >> That's intense."
153,00:08:44.46,00:08:44.46,>> He just jumped in the water and stabbed it.
154,00:08:46.75,00:08:46.75,>> I whacked him. He started thrashing around.
155,00:08:49.00,00:08:49.00,"I jumped on him, worked down to his tail"
156,00:08:50.67,00:08:50.67,and then just pulled him out. >> You're a madman.
157,00:08:56.75,00:08:56.75,>> Geez! You try to be the provider.
158,00:08:59.04,00:08:59.04,"All you're trying do is bring in enough food for the tribe,"
159,00:09:01.38,00:09:01.38,and then somebody has to come along
160,00:09:03.04,00:09:03.04,and one-up the hell out of you. >> The adrenaline is leaving
161,00:09:06.00,00:09:06.00,now; I'm scared. What did I just do?
162,00:09:07.71,00:09:07.71,>>  I got a big giant clam and then Tom came back
163,00:09:10.75,00:09:10.75,"and got the shark. So, next, I guess, the next step"
164,00:09:13.25,00:09:13.25,"for me is to get, like, a humpback whale"
165,00:09:15.12,00:09:15.12,"or something and bring it in. >> Tom, that was"
166,00:09:20.04,00:09:20.04,one of the most unbelievable things I think I've ever seen.
167,00:09:22.12,00:09:22.12,">> I say, he keeps one-upping me."
168,00:09:24.12,00:09:24.12,>> ( whoops ) >> The cat's out of the bag
169,00:09:27.21,00:09:27.21,that I'm a strong player and I'm fit and I'm not
170,00:09:30.21,00:09:30.21,the oldest guy on the tribe. I would think the butcher
171,00:09:33.12,00:09:33.12,"wrapped it, huh? With a little butcher"
172,00:09:34.67,00:09:34.67,string and stuff. You can't go back
173,00:09:37.12,00:09:37.12,"and, and now pretend that you're less than you are"
174,00:09:40.42,00:09:40.42,"or that you're-- you know, don't have"
175,00:09:42.00,00:09:42.00,capabilities. It's kind of done.
176,00:09:44.08,00:09:44.08,Unbelievable. >> Mm-hmm.
177,00:09:46.54,00:09:46.54,"That's good. Here, I'm grabbing..."
178,00:09:49.67,00:09:49.67,"Oh, now who's the great white shark killer?"
179,00:09:51.67,00:09:51.67,>> I seriously don't think I can eat any more.
180,00:09:53.67,00:09:53.67,">> So we had all this meat. Everybody was all excited, so"
181,00:09:56.00,00:09:56.00,Tom went to here catching the shark.
182,00:09:58.12,00:09:58.12,"And so it's like, ""Oh..."" The second he caught it,"
183,00:10:00.71,00:10:00.71,"me and Gregg both looked at each other and went,"
184,00:10:02.75,00:10:02.75,"""Hmm. It's going to be a lot harder to vote him off now."""
185,00:10:06.12,00:10:06.12,"You know, you can only taunt me so long"
186,00:10:07.96,00:10:07.96,before I strike back at you. >> Hmm.
187,00:10:22.46,00:10:22.46,>> ( imitates bottle popping open )
188,00:10:25.46,00:10:25.46,What have we got here? Want to read it?
189,00:10:28.46,00:10:28.46,">> ""You're lost in the wild. There's no one around."

194,00:10:41.25,00:10:41.25,"and within the next hour. ""If your signal's the best,"
195,00:10:43.71,00:10:43.71,"he'll drop supplies to devour. >> ""So put your brains together."
196,00:10:46.96,00:10:46.96,"""You can use only three. ""Creativity will reign"
197,00:10:49.42,00:10:49.42,"victorious. Which tribe will it be?"""
198,00:10:53.71,00:10:53.71,So we have to build some sort of signal.
199,00:10:55.25,00:10:55.25,>> We have to build a signal. >> Something you can
200,00:10:57.25,00:10:57.25,see from the air. >> I say we burn our friggin'
201,00:10:59.71,00:10:59.71,"shelter, our old shelter. >> I can knock that"
202,00:11:01.58,00:11:01.58,bathroom down and y'all can burn
203,00:11:02.96,00:11:02.96,all that lumber. >> We got tree mail telling us
204,00:11:07.04,00:11:07.04,"to build a signal that is very creative,"
205,00:11:10.08,00:11:10.08,that could be seen from the air.
206,00:11:11.62,00:11:11.62,There's going to be a plane that's going to fly over
207,00:11:14.21,00:11:14.21,and decide whether our signal is better or whether Koror's
208,00:11:16.29,00:11:16.29,signal is better. It's going to drop a load of
209,00:11:18.92,00:11:18.92,supplies and goods to devour. We really need it.
210,00:11:23.62,00:11:23.62,We could use the food and we could use
211,00:11:25.71,00:11:25.71,"the, the just, morale boost. >> So we're going to do ""Ulong"""
212,00:11:28.33,00:11:28.33,in fire? >> Each of us get on like an end
213,00:11:30.67,00:11:30.67,"and start lighting the ends, you know?"
214,00:11:33.04,00:11:33.04,">> Let's just gather as many as we can now,"
215,00:11:34.62,00:11:34.62,"start the fire, and then we can continue"
216,00:11:37.29,00:11:37.29,to feed the fire in the form of Ulong.
217,00:11:39.29,00:11:39.29,>> Yeah. >> While those three are
218,00:11:46.12,00:11:46.12,"doing this, the rest of them are"
219,00:11:48.83,00:11:48.83,going and getting food and water and stuff.
220,00:11:50.67,00:11:50.67,"We don't win, we're going to have to go"
221,00:11:54.33,00:11:54.33,get food after this. >> It's all good.
222,00:11:55.92,00:11:55.92,">> You know what I mean? Oh, yeah, it's all good."
223,00:11:58.58,00:11:58.58,I'm just saying. That's what stinks about
224,00:12:01.25,00:12:01.25,being down in numbers. >> We've been tearing apart
225,00:12:09.25,00:12:09.25,our old shelter to use for this challenge.
226,00:12:11.08,00:12:11.08,We've been cutting bamboo and using part of our bathroom.
227,00:12:14.83,00:12:14.83,We've used everything we can. We really want to win this.
228,00:12:17.21,00:12:17.21,I'm sure the other tribe's doing pretty good.
229,00:12:19.42,00:12:19.42,They've been doing pretty good at everything else.
230,00:12:21.08,00:12:21.08,So I'm not underestimating them one bit.
231,00:12:23.21,00:12:23.21,So far it seems like they have a lot of smart people.
232,00:12:25.71,00:12:25.71,So we're just going to see if work can overtake smartness
233,00:12:27.08,00:12:27.08,"right now. >> ""So put your brains together."
234,00:12:34.21,00:12:34.21,"You can use only three. ""Creativity will reign"
235,00:12:36.04,00:12:36.04,"victorious. Which tribe will it be?"""
236,00:12:38.54,00:12:38.54,>> We can use only three people. Who wants to perform?
237,00:12:42.12,00:12:42.12,>> I'd like to perform. You want to be a team?
238,00:12:45.21,00:12:45.21,">> I'll do it, too. I can do it."
239,00:12:47.58,00:12:47.58,"I'll be in. So who, me, Katie and Caryn?"
240,00:12:52.17,00:12:52.17,>> I'd like to do it. >> Go to it.
241,00:12:55.04,00:12:55.04,Make us proud. >> The message said we had to do
242,00:12:58.83,00:12:58.83,"an SOS, and only three people could participate."
243,00:13:01.62,00:13:01.62,"So through long talks and discussion ,it turned out to be"
244,00:13:04.08,00:13:04.08,"Gregg, Caryn and Katie. Which I actually think"
245,00:13:07.08,00:13:07.08,"is a good choice, because Katie is very creative."
246,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,Caryn is a hard worker and then Gregg's got the muscle.
247,00:13:12.08,00:13:12.08,>> Start bringing all the bamboo down?
248,00:13:13.17,00:13:13.17,>> Yep. >> We'll get the frame and
249,00:13:15.08,00:13:15.08,we'll get that stuff down? >> Yep.
250,00:13:18.79,00:13:18.79,>> The first thing we wanted to do is find the right location.
251,00:13:21.79,00:13:21.79,We're a little shortchanged in terms of shoreline
252,00:13:23.96,00:13:23.96,back at camp. So first thing we did was moved
253,00:13:26.25,00:13:26.25,"our location halfway down the beach,"
254,00:13:28.58,00:13:28.58,which just getting our materials there was a lot of work.
255,00:13:34.00,00:13:34.00,>> This is a tough challenge. This is really...
256,00:13:36.58,00:13:36.58,"It's high 80s, low 90s. It's tough to stay hydrated"
257,00:13:39.46,00:13:39.46,"and refreshed when the sun is beating down on you,"
258,00:13:42.17,00:13:42.17,and we're working in the sun because we want to be
259,00:13:45.33,00:13:45.33,in an open stretch of sand where the plane can see us.
260,00:13:50.38,00:13:50.38,"A boat in the water, right? We don't have a beach."
261,00:13:52.96,00:13:52.96,It's a problem. It's nerve-racking.
262,00:13:55.42,00:13:55.42,I'm sitting here like a cat on a hot tin roof.
263,00:13:59.00,00:13:59.00,You want to be a part of this thing.
264,00:14:01.00,00:14:01.00,You just want to help. There's a lot on the line.
265,00:14:05.00,00:14:05.00,"There's nothing you can do, but be an observer."
266,00:14:07.54,00:14:07.54,And I don't like the position. There's a lot of apprehension
267,00:14:11.54,00:14:11.54,"from where I'm sitting. >> Okay, so the idea is"
268,00:14:19.25,00:14:19.25,to get as much attention from above as possible.
269,00:14:23.21,00:14:23.21,So we're using bamboo and coconut
270,00:14:25.42,00:14:25.42,"to outline our letters, which is ""Got food?"""
271,00:14:31.17,00:14:31.17,It's a great question. We're making two big fire
272,00:14:34.83,00:14:34.83,bundles right here that we're going to light
273,00:14:36.75,00:14:36.75,right when they get there to get some black smoke going.
274,00:14:39.21,00:14:39.21,We're gonna see if the rope soaked in kerosene works.
275,00:14:42.25,00:14:42.25,I think that would be a great thing if we can use that
276,00:14:43.88,00:14:43.88,because that would be something they wouldn't have.
277,00:14:45.96,00:14:45.96,">> It works, yeah. Works good."
278,00:14:51.12,00:14:51.12,">> It's getting late, huh? >> Yeah."
279,00:14:54.29,00:14:54.29,>> I just hope they don't wait too late to start the fire.
280,00:14:56.88,00:14:56.88,"So much hinges on that fire, you know?"
281,00:14:58.75,00:14:58.75,>> Yeah. >> How are you going to make
282,00:15:02.00,00:15:02.00,"sure that stays lit? If you're careful at first,"
283,00:15:03.83,00:15:03.83,"once it's lit, it'll join in the hoopla."
284,00:15:05.83,00:15:05.83,">> Hoopla. >> PROBST: All right, Bob,"
285,00:15:13.62,00:15:13.62,Here's the setup. Both tribes were given
286,00:15:16.04,00:15:16.04,instruction to build an SOS That would be visible
287,00:15:18.67,00:15:18.67,from the air. >> Got it.
288,00:15:19.83,00:15:19.83,">> PROBST: Your job as a certified drop master,"
289,00:15:22.04,00:15:22.04,check out both camps and judge which one
290,00:15:24.88,00:15:24.88,"is, in fact, most visible. You ready to give it a go?"
291,00:15:27.50,00:15:27.50,">> Let's go have a look. >> PROBST: All right,"
292,00:15:29.50,00:15:29.50,head over to Ulong. >> Here he comes.
293,00:15:42.79,00:15:42.79,">> ( yelling ) >> PROBST: All right, Bob,"
294,00:15:57.71,00:15:57.71,you had a chance to look at Ulong's camp.
295,00:16:00.17,00:16:00.17,"Give me your assessment. >> Well, if you're not flying"
296,00:16:03.46,00:16:03.46,"right over the top of it, it's very hard to see."
297,00:16:06.21,00:16:06.21,It's stuck way back into the forest.
298,00:16:08.17,00:16:08.17,"But it was big, it was visible, It's not bad for three people."
299,00:16:16.08,00:16:16.08,>> PROBST: Head out to Koror. >> How is it coming?
300,00:16:21.67,00:16:21.67,">> Don't worry about me, guys. >> Here they come!"
301,00:16:28.25,00:16:28.25,"Come on, Caryn. >> Get ready, Caryn."
302,00:16:30.12,00:16:30.12,It's working. >> There's the plane.
303,00:16:33.96,00:16:33.96,">> Yep, here comes the plane. >> Coming from here,"
304,00:16:40.25,00:16:40.25,I don't see any smoke or anything.
305,00:16:42.25,00:16:42.25,">> Yeah, I don't see any sm... You can see it from here."
306,00:16:44.04,00:16:44.04,I don't see any smoke. We could see what
307,00:16:46.08,00:16:46.08,they were doing from here. I didn't see any smoke at all.
308,00:16:49.67,00:16:49.67,And almost their whole plan was fire.
309,00:16:51.96,00:16:51.96,"So my fear, I think, might have come to truth"
310,00:16:53.92,00:16:53.92,that I don't know if they got the fire lit.
311,00:16:56.00,00:16:56.00,"I think the odds are against us, to be honest."
312,00:17:00.75,00:17:00.75,">> PROBST: All right, Bob, give me your assessment"
313,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,"over Koror's SOS. >> Well, Koror's SOS--"
314,00:17:08.50,00:17:08.50,"it was creative, it was bigger,"
315,00:17:11.08,00:17:11.08,"but the big thing was it was set down off the beach,"
316,00:17:13.83,00:17:13.83,which makes it more visible. >> PROBST: You're the judge in
317,00:17:16.33,00:17:16.33,this. Do you have enough information to make a decision?
318,00:17:17.92,00:17:17.92,">> Yes, I do. >> PROBST: Let's set up"
319,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,for the drop. ( cheering )
320,00:17:39.67,00:17:39.67,>> I'm so glad for you guys! >> I'm so happy!
321,00:17:45.04,00:17:45.04,"I'm so happy! >> Sweet, guys!"
322,00:17:56.75,00:17:56.75,Sweet! >> Brains over brawn once again.
323,00:18:00.21,00:18:00.21,>> That's right. >> Ooh!

337,00:18:35.92,00:18:35.92,">> I'm just, I'm... To a great tribe."
338,00:18:39.88,00:18:39.88,To a great tribe. Our tribe really worked
339,00:18:42.08,00:18:42.08,together well. We are like a well-oiled
340,00:18:44.79,00:18:44.79,machine. >> For believing in us to win.
341,00:18:47.00,00:18:47.00,>> Thanks for believing in us. >> We win a lot of challenges
342,00:18:49.83,00:18:49.83,"for a reason. I mean, it doesn't happen"
343,00:18:51.79,00:18:51.79,by accident. Peanut butter.
344,00:18:54.21,00:18:54.21,>> How good is that? >> Poor Ulong.
345,00:18:58.17,00:18:58.17,There's three of them now. I don't know how they can
346,00:19:01.04,00:19:01.04,"maintain camp, compete in challenges"
347,00:19:03.17,00:19:03.17,and stay mentally strong. I think they must just be
348,00:19:06.17,00:19:06.17,absolutely beat up over this. ( airplane approaching )
349,00:19:20.62,00:19:20.62,>> Here it comes. >> I'm not sure what's going on
350,00:19:23.04,00:19:23.04,here. Ours?

352,00:19:27.21,00:19:27.21,">> Please! >> Stop, stop..."
353,00:19:30.62,00:19:30.62,">> Oh, that's so mean if they don't drop here."
354,00:19:32.71,00:19:32.71,">> What are they doing?! >> Oh, my God, no!"
355,00:19:37.50,00:19:37.50,>> I guess we lost the reward challenge
356,00:19:41.12,00:19:41.12,because the plane flew by and didn't drop anything.
357,00:19:44.46,00:19:44.46,We worked hard on it. >> I guess they worked harder.
358,00:19:48.88,00:19:48.88,">> Or I'm sure they worked smarter, knowing them."
359,00:19:51.29,00:19:51.29,>> We thought we won. >> Gregg and Jenn-- they joke
360,00:20:22.04,00:20:22.04,"about it, about him being the make-out bandit"
361,00:20:24.12,00:20:24.12,"and they kiss and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
362,00:20:28.21,00:20:28.21,So I guess they think they're dating.
363,00:20:30.08,00:20:30.08,I don't know. I don't know.
364,00:20:31.79,00:20:31.79,I don't really care. As long as I can get them
365,00:20:34.17,00:20:34.17,on my side and my vote. >> Going once?
366,00:20:36.04,00:20:36.04,">> Where you going, Jenn? >> She's going to get water."
367,00:20:39.12,00:20:39.12,"I'll go with you, Jenn. Should I put on my date clothes?"

369,00:20:46.04,00:20:46.04,"but when we're talking, I can't really have"
370,00:20:48.04,00:20:48.04,"a great conversation with her 'cause I'm, like,"
371,00:20:50.04,00:20:50.04,are people looking at us? How are they reading
372,00:20:53.04,00:20:53.04,"this conversation? People are going to be, like,"
373,00:20:55.04,00:20:55.04,"all right, they're talking strategy."
374,00:20:57.04,00:20:57.04,They're going to be suspicious. They're not going to trust us.
375,00:21:14.21,00:21:14.21,Me? >> Mm-hmm.
376,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,>> Really? >> It's tough because
377,00:21:25.25,00:21:25.25,I am playing a game. It's tough for me to play a game
378,00:21:28.58,00:21:28.58,"and be, like, a good date, you know?"
379,00:21:31.88,00:21:31.88,I can easily get sidetracked by women.
380,00:21:35.29,00:21:35.29,So I'm making a conscious effort to play things cool.
381,00:21:44.42,00:21:44.42,Jenn felt I was just starting to be kind of standoffish.
382,00:21:47.17,00:21:47.17,"Because we had you know, kicked things off"
383,00:21:49.62,00:21:49.62,really well and it was kind of exciting.
384,00:21:51.29,00:21:51.29,But then you kind of get into the context of the game
385,00:21:53.46,00:21:53.46,"and realize, you know, that's your priority."
386,00:21:59.17,00:21:59.17,>> Mm-hmm. I like Gregg a lot
387,00:22:05.92,00:22:05.92,and I think he likes me a lot. But Gregg is very intensely
388,00:22:09.62,00:22:09.62,focused on this game. It's all he can think about.
389,00:22:13.29,00:22:13.29,"So there have been days where he's very off to me,"
390,00:22:16.17,00:22:16.17,"and it's been kind of strange. You know, until we spoke,"
391,00:22:19.42,00:22:19.42,I didn't know what was going on.
392,00:22:21.04,00:22:21.04,"You know, I didn't know if he was still, if he was still"
393,00:22:23.17,00:22:23.17,"in the same place, if we're just going"
394,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,"to be that alliance, but there is still"
395,00:22:27.25,00:22:27.25,a romantic connection. It's still there.
396,00:22:28.58,00:22:28.58,"We'll just see if he can, he can loosen up a bit."
397,00:22:35.92,00:22:35.92,">> I'm concerned with Gregg and Jenn because they are tight,"
398,00:22:40.12,00:22:40.12,you know? What is going to happen
399,00:22:42.58,00:22:42.58,when all of a sudden we have to tell Gregg or Jenn
400,00:22:45.17,00:22:45.17,that the other one may be getting voted off
401,00:22:47.42,00:22:47.42,that night? You're bringing in a whole
402,00:22:49.25,00:22:49.25,different volatile emotion that is separate from this game.
403,00:22:54.08,00:22:54.08,"So, uh, I'm, I'm concerned. We're all watching"
404,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,the relationship and seeing where
405,00:22:59.38,00:22:59.38,the alliances lie. The little romance or whatever
406,00:23:02.88,00:23:02.88,"they've got blossoming, it just could be"
407,00:23:04.71,00:23:04.71,a monkey wrench that we don't see coming.
408,00:23:29.21,00:23:29.21,>> Got a clam? >> Uh-huh.
409,00:23:31.21,00:23:31.21,">> Way to go, boy. >> Good job!"
410,00:23:36.17,00:23:36.17,>> Damn. >> Bobby Jon was able to catch
411,00:23:39.46,00:23:39.46,"a pretty large clam, and a nice little hand-sized"
412,00:23:41.79,00:23:41.79,"black fish. Oh, man, when he got that fish,"
413,00:23:45.38,00:23:45.38,"we were all super excited. >> Good, isn't it?"
414,00:23:48.88,00:23:48.88,">> Yeah. >> Well, we got something."
415,00:23:51.12,00:23:51.12,">> Yeah. Good job! >> Gosh, hitting that fish felt"
416,00:23:55.71,00:23:55.71,"like making an extra point, you know, to win the game"
417,00:23:58.00,00:23:58.00,"or something like that. I felt like, like I had scored,"
418,00:24:00.42,00:24:00.42,you know. It felt nice.
419,00:24:04.33,00:24:04.33,I think that fish done. >> I'm just going to try
420,00:24:08.88,00:24:08.88,to cut him up. >>  Finally we were able
421,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,to get some protein in our bodies.
422,00:24:13.62,00:24:13.62,We ate the clam. We ate the fish and we ate
423,00:24:16.92,00:24:16.92,"I don't know how many pans of coconut, so, you know,"
424,00:24:19.62,00:24:19.62,"we got protein, we got carbs, we got everything."
425,00:24:22.17,00:24:22.17,>> I think it's pretty damn good.
426,00:24:23.58,00:24:23.58,">> Yeah. >> I mean, I feel the protein."
427,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,"The meal was good. I mean, it was nice to be full"
428,00:24:28.33,00:24:28.33,for a change. I definitely think the food
429,00:24:30.33,00:24:30.33,will help us in a challenge if we get one.
430,00:24:38.46,00:24:38.46,"Oh, cool. >> ""The way to lose this one"
431,00:24:41.92,00:24:41.92,"is to be just plain lazy. >> BOTH: ""Don't think you need"
432,00:24:45.08,00:24:45.08,"to practice? ""Then you're just crazy."
433,00:24:47.25,00:24:47.25,">> ""To keep your tribe together, slot the pieces into place."
434,00:24:50.92,00:24:50.92,">> Got to heed this warning or you could be out of the race."""
435,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,">> Yeah, immunity. That's supposed to be a star."
436,00:24:57.62,00:24:57.62,">> Yeah, it's supposed to look just like that."
437,00:24:59.17,00:24:59.17,"Okay, cool. Let's go sit down."
438,00:25:00.46,00:25:00.46,>> Let's go sit down and do it.
439,00:25:01.88,00:25:01.88,">> We just got tree mail, we have an immunity challenge,"
440,00:25:04.25,00:25:04.25,and something to do with a puzzle.
441,00:25:07.29,00:25:07.29,"And if we don't get it together,"
442,00:25:08.62,00:25:08.62,one of our tribe members could be going home.
443,00:25:11.08,00:25:11.08,"Sliding them around. This got to go up somehow,"
444,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,it's got to go... >> We always keep the faith.
445,00:25:16.88,00:25:16.88,We haven't won one yet. Maybe today will be different.
446,00:25:21.21,00:25:21.21,We're ready. We're full.
447,00:25:29.88,00:25:29.88,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. What's going on, Koror?"
448,00:25:37.38,00:25:37.38,We now bring in Ulong. James voted out
449,00:25:40.67,00:25:40.67,at the last Tribal Council. >> James!
450,00:25:45.12,00:25:45.12,You ain't lying. >> ( mimics James ): Come on.
451,00:25:50.04,00:25:50.04,>> PROBST: And then there were three.
452,00:25:52.62,00:25:52.62,"How's the fishing going, Ulong? >> We got a little hand-sized"
453,00:25:54.92,00:25:54.92,little black fish. Finally.
454,00:25:56.12,00:25:56.12,"I'm just scared to death of sharks, so I'm just"
455,00:25:58.88,00:25:58.88,"trying to get over all that. >> PROBST: How about for you,"
456,00:26:01.04,00:26:01.04,"Koror, any luck with fishing? >> We're doing okay."
457,00:26:03.08,00:26:03.08,">> Yeah, the beast master came out"
458,00:26:05.92,00:26:05.92,and Tom battled a shark and he killed with it a machete.
459,00:26:10.29,00:26:10.29,">> We ate shark until we were sick, actually."
460,00:26:12.71,00:26:12.71,We rolled it into a roast and spit-fired it
461,00:26:15.75,00:26:15.75,and we cut nice steaks and we had quite a feed.
462,00:26:19.79,00:26:19.79,"Steph, you guys are struggling just to get by,"
463,00:26:23.21,00:26:23.21,and Koror is winning and then finding shark
464,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,and eating big meals. >> I'm not a good loser.
465,00:26:28.58,00:26:28.58,And for them to win the rewards and win the immunities
466,00:26:32.62,00:26:32.62,"and get lots of food, it's pretty tough."
467,00:26:34.29,00:26:34.29,>> PROBST: All right. Let's get to today's
468,00:26:36.12,00:26:36.12,immunity challenge. First things first.
469,00:26:37.88,00:26:37.88,"Katie, I'll take it back again. Immunity is back up"
470,00:26:43.96,00:26:43.96,"for grabs. In tree mail, both tribes"
471,00:26:46.08,00:26:46.08,received a miniature version of a sea star puzzle.
472,00:26:49.54,00:26:49.54,"For today's challenge, both tribes will have identical"
473,00:26:52.12,00:26:52.12,life-size sea star puzzles floating in the ocean.
474,00:26:56.08,00:26:56.08,One person will be your caller. Two other people will be
475,00:26:58.92,00:26:58.92,responsible for moving the pieces around.
476,00:27:00.83,00:27:00.83,First tribe to solve the puzzle wins immunity.
477,00:27:03.79,00:27:03.79,"All right, Koror. Gregg, Caryn and Katie"
478,00:27:06.08,00:27:06.08,"participated in the reward. You guys are sitting this out,"
479,00:27:10.04,00:27:10.04,along with two other people. Who are the two
480,00:27:12.25,00:27:12.25,other sit-outs? >> I'm sitting out.
481,00:27:13.46,00:27:13.46,>> PROBST: Tom and Ian are also sitting out.
482,00:27:14.96,00:27:14.96,"Who's going to be your caller, Koror?"
483,00:27:16.25,00:27:16.25,">> Me. >> PROBST: Ulong, who's going to"
484,00:27:17.96,00:27:17.96,be the caller? >> Myself.
485,00:27:19.00,00:27:19.00,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon. >> Yes, sir."
486,00:27:20.00,00:27:20.00,">> PROBST: Swim on out to the pontoons, wait for my go."
487,00:27:23.50,00:27:23.50,Here we go. For immunity.
488,00:27:25.08,00:27:25.08,Survivors ready? Go!
489,00:27:29.96,00:27:29.96,>> The one on the right needs to go to the empty spot.
490,00:27:35.54,00:27:35.54,That one right there. The one to the right of you
491,00:27:41.21,00:27:41.21,needs to go to the empty spot. >> PROBST: Coby definitely has a
492,00:27:43.88,00:27:43.88,plan. >> Let's go back.
493,00:27:47.71,00:27:47.71,My fault. Let's go back. >> Go back?
494,00:27:49.71,00:27:49.71,">> Yeah, go back to where it was."
495,00:27:50.88,00:27:50.88,">> You think if we moved this over and up, that one over,"
496,00:27:53.25,00:27:53.25,"that one down, this one over? >> Okay."
497,00:27:57.17,00:27:57.17,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon and Steph working together,"
498,00:27:59.33,00:27:59.33,but not sure on the progress. Left.
499,00:28:04.17,00:28:04.17,There's a spot. Yeah!
500,00:28:06.04,00:28:06.04,Finally got that part. >> PROBST: Top edge.
501,00:28:09.88,00:28:09.88,Koror looks to have a bit of an edge at this point.
502,00:28:11.50,00:28:11.50,">> Attaboy, Coby. >> You want to move..."
503,00:28:13.96,00:28:13.96,I want that one to be up here. >> Which one?
504,00:28:16.04,00:28:16.04,">> This one's got to go here. That one's gotta come over,"
505,00:28:18.54,00:28:18.54,that one's gotta go down. I think if we move
506,00:28:20.58,00:28:20.58,this one back and start from that side
507,00:28:22.79,00:28:22.79,"and bring it up? >> PROBST: How you doing,"
508,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,Bobby Jon? >> I'm trying to get our corners
509,00:28:29.17,00:28:29.17,in order right now. >> PROBST: Ulong may be worse
510,00:28:33.12,00:28:33.12,off than when you started. Janu just having a hard time
511,00:28:38.17,00:28:38.17,"holding her breath. >> Behind you, empty spot."
512,00:28:45.00,00:28:45.00,"Finally. We're halfway done, you guys."
513,00:28:47.12,00:28:47.12,>> PROBST: Koror is halfway there.
514,00:28:50.12,00:28:50.12,">> Good job, Coby. >> All right."
515,00:28:55.79,00:28:55.79,">> All right. >> This corner, Steph,"
516,00:28:58.83,00:28:58.83,"the one you got your hand on, uh-uh, right here."
517,00:29:01.79,00:29:01.79,>> Right here? >> Yeah.
518,00:29:04.12,00:29:04.12,"Wait a minute, that is that corner."
519,00:29:07.58,00:29:07.58,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon, I'm not sure you've made any progress"
520,00:29:10.17,00:29:10.17,"since we started. Steph, want to get up here"
521,00:29:15.54,00:29:15.54,for a second? >> PROBST: Ulong going
522,00:29:18.96,00:29:18.96,to switch out callers. Switch 'em out and see if we can
523,00:29:21.71,00:29:21.71,get a little more progress. Steph going to take over
524,00:29:27.08,00:29:27.08,"for Ulong. >> Oh, man."
525,00:29:31.17,00:29:31.17,>> PROBST: Steph surveys. You in good shape
526,00:29:34.17,00:29:34.17,"or bad shape, Steph? >> We're not in that good"
527,00:29:37.25,00:29:37.25,a shape. Um... >> PROBST: Steph going to have
528,00:29:39.25,00:29:39.25,"to make up a lot of ground. >> That next one, come forward."
529,00:29:46.50,00:29:46.50,This one there needs to come up here.
530,00:29:48.71,00:29:48.71,">> PROBST: Steph hustling, trying catch up."
531,00:29:50.83,00:29:50.83,">> Back, empty spot. >> PROBST: Janu, you look like"
532,00:29:58.62,00:29:58.62,you've swam a marathon right now.
533,00:30:02.04,00:30:02.04,">> That one's got to go in that corner,"
534,00:30:03.04,00:30:03.04,that one's got to go back there. That piece over there's
535,00:30:07.42,00:30:07.42,got to come here. That one is going to come.
536,00:30:18.71,00:30:18.71,We're going to go full circle. Bring that back around.
537,00:30:23.33,00:30:23.33,That one to the left. >> PROBST: Ulong picking up.
538,00:30:26.54,00:30:26.54,">> Back, empty spot. >> PROBST: Koror down"
539,00:30:29.33,00:30:29.33,to their last few pieces. They won't be easy.
540,00:30:36.12,00:30:36.12,>> PROBST: Coby very close for Koror.
541,00:30:38.17,00:30:38.17,"He can see it. >> Come on, Coby!"
542,00:30:41.58,00:30:41.58,>> Left empty spot and that's where we got it.
543,00:30:43.88,00:30:43.88,>> PROBST: Koror one move away from their sixth straight
544,00:30:45.88,00:30:45.88,immunity. >> This is it.
545,00:30:47.29,00:30:47.29,This is the last one. ( Koror cheering )
546,00:30:51.67,00:30:51.67,">> PROBST: And with that, Koror wins immunity"
547,00:30:53.08,00:30:53.08,"for the sixth straight time. Koror, once again,"
548,00:31:00.71,00:31:00.71,immunity going back to camp.
549,00:31:02.96,00:31:02.96,Nobody from this tribe going home.
550,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,"Ulong, you started making some progress at the end."
551,00:31:08.58,00:31:08.58,Too little too late. It's the same old song.
552,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,Tribal Council again and it's going
553,00:31:12.33,00:31:12.33,"to be Bobby Jon, Ibrehem or Steph"
554,00:31:14.25,00:31:14.25,who's going home. Head on back to camp.
555,00:31:16.83,00:31:16.83,I'll see you at Tribal. >> When we got back to the beach
556,00:31:48.21,00:31:48.21,"after the challenge, we were all shocked"
557,00:31:51.08,00:31:51.08,that we couldn't believe we were going back to Tribal Council.
558,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,I think we've... This has to be a record.
559,00:31:56.29,00:31:56.29,Seven times in a row for one tribe.
560,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,Good God. I don't want to vote.
561,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,">> You got to vote. >> I just hate it, though,"
562,00:32:06.83,00:32:06.83,'cause I think all of us deserve to be here.
563,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,"I guess it's always good to, you know,"
564,00:32:11.08,00:32:11.08,expect the worst-case scenario sometime.
565,00:32:13.71,00:32:13.71,>> Yeah. Here's the thing.
566,00:32:16.12,00:32:16.12,You're fighting with these two people
567,00:32:17.25,00:32:17.25,"for a million dollars, but at the same time,"
568,00:32:19.08,00:32:19.08,"they're still on your team, and you want your team to do well."
569,00:32:23.04,00:32:23.04,"So which one do you pick? Right now, I'm like a swing"
570,00:32:27.71,00:32:27.71,vote. I got Stephenie who wants me
571,00:32:29.75,00:32:29.75,to go with her and then I got Ibrehem.
572,00:32:32.83,00:32:32.83,Ibrehem and I have had pretty much had a little trust
573,00:32:36.00,00:32:36.00,thing since day one. We're from the same state.
574,00:32:38.88,00:32:38.88,"One, two, three. And we just kind of got"
575,00:32:43.33,00:32:43.33,a common theme going and we know that.
576,00:32:45.58,00:32:45.58,"I know that and he knows that. He's never went and said, ""Oh,"
577,00:32:48.58,00:32:48.58,"you and I have an alliance,"" because I think in some ways"
578,00:32:50.88,00:32:50.88,"that's kind of stupid, but in some ways it does matter."
579,00:32:57.58,00:32:57.58,"You got it? >> Way to go, boy."
580,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,>> There ain't no fish down there.
581,00:33:03.75,00:33:03.75,>> You straight? You getting tired?
582,00:33:05.08,00:33:05.08,">> No, I'm all right. >> All right."
583,00:33:06.42,00:33:06.42,">> I know Ibrehem would take it like a man if he wins or loses,"
584,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,and I know Stephenie would be a little upset
585,00:33:12.83,00:33:12.83,"if I vote, you know, for her because she thinks"
586,00:33:15.50,00:33:15.50,"that she and I made this, you know, big-time agreement."
587,00:33:21.21,00:33:21.21,>> I should have never got myself in a situation
588,00:33:23.62,00:33:23.62,with two guys from Alabama. I feel like my fate
589,00:33:27.12,00:33:27.12,is in these two boys' hands. And it just sucks because
590,00:33:29.83,00:33:29.83,"they're the same age, they're from the same state,"
591,00:33:31.75,00:33:31.75,"they got a lot in common. And I'm, like,"
592,00:33:34.50,00:33:34.50,"the outcast, kind of. My plan is just get Bobby Jon"
593,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,alone and talk to him. I thought we were sticking
594,00:33:47.25,00:33:47.25,"together no matter what. >> Well, we are sticking"
595,00:33:49.04,00:33:49.04,"together, but it's kind of a toss-up, you know, between me,"
596,00:33:51.38,00:33:51.38,"you and him, you know. I don't deserve to stay"
597,00:33:54.12,00:33:54.12,no more than nobody else. You know?
598,00:33:55.88,00:33:55.88,"I mean, really. >> I think we deserve to stay."
599,00:33:59.33,00:33:59.33,">> I think we do, too. But, I mean, I ain't"
600,00:34:01.25,00:34:01.25,"going to count my man out, which I know what you"
601,00:34:03.54,00:34:03.54,"and I, you know, discussed. And I know what he"
602,00:34:06.21,00:34:06.21,and I have discussed. >> So you're not sticking
603,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,"with your word, then? >> I've been sticking with"
604,00:34:10.50,00:34:10.50,him since day one. But now I'm sticking
605,00:34:12.08,00:34:12.08,"with you, you know. The way I look it is, we're"
606,00:34:14.79,00:34:14.79,going to say okay zip it. >> I thought...
607,00:34:18.08,00:34:18.08,"Yeah, I know, but I thought that we said if it was us three,"
608,00:34:21.08,00:34:21.08,"we would vote Ib out. Yeah, yeah, but I want"
609,00:34:23.00,00:34:23.00,to kind of wait before we start
610,00:34:24.17,00:34:24.17,talking about all that. I don't really want to talk
611,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,"about it, you know what I mean? Yeah."
612,00:34:28.79,00:34:28.79,I'm not going to rule anybody out until the tribe has spoken.
613,00:34:33.21,00:34:33.21,>> It was a little wishy-washy his answer.
614,00:34:36.12,00:34:36.12,"But I can tell by the way he's acting,"
615,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,he's going to vote for me. I'm just pissed.
616,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,It's just wrong. It's the wrong decision.
617,00:34:42.88,00:34:42.88,It's not my time. I would love to turn
618,00:34:45.08,00:34:45.08,the tables on him. Bobby Jon knows how bad
619,00:34:48.50,00:34:48.50,"I want to stay, and I'm not ready to go yet."
620,00:34:51.29,00:34:51.29,And I don't plan on going. And there's no reason
621,00:34:53.42,00:34:53.42,"for me to go. I mean, I'm thinking about doing"
622,00:35:01.25,00:35:01.25,"it, 'cause he promised me and I know he promised you, too."
623,00:35:06.79,00:35:06.79,And why leave it in his hands when we could end it right now?
624,00:35:10.08,00:35:10.08,">> Yeah. >> But now he's, like,"
625,00:35:13.50,00:35:13.50,"undecided, and if we vote for each other we're going to let"
626,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,"him decide, so I'll vote for him."
627,00:35:24.21,00:35:24.21,"If you want. >> I'm just being honest, I'll"
628,00:35:27.25,00:35:27.25,shoot it to you straight. I don't know...
629,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,I don't know what the hell I'm going to do.
630,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,I hate we're even in this situation.
631,00:36:09.67,00:36:09.67,>> PROBST ( hoarse voice ): I want to apologize for my
632,00:36:11.67,00:36:11.67,voice. I know it's hard to hear.
633,00:36:13.46,00:36:13.46,"Bobby Jon... >> Yes, sir."
634,00:36:15.33,00:36:15.33,">> PROBST: ...who decided that, that you should be the set of"
635,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,"eyes today, the caller? >> We all did."
636,00:36:19.33,00:36:19.33,"We all did. And, obviously, it wasn't a"
637,00:36:20.54,00:36:20.54,good idea because I think I made more of a mess than I did
638,00:36:25.08,00:36:25.08,"create something that was supposed to happen,"
639,00:36:27.71,00:36:27.71,"and it didn't happen. >> PROBST: You agree with that,"
640,00:36:29.71,00:36:29.71,Steph? Did Bobby Jon screw it up?
641,00:36:31.96,00:36:31.96,>> We just assumed that... or agreed that
642,00:36:33.79,00:36:33.79,"he would be the best, and he wasn't able to get it,"
643,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,so we switched out. I wasn't able really
644,00:36:38.38,00:36:38.38,"to get it either, so... >> PROBST: How frustrating was"
645,00:36:40.54,00:36:40.54,"it for you today, Steph? >> It's..."
646,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,"it's so frustrating. I mean, losing this many times,"
647,00:36:47.42,00:36:47.42,it's so frustrating. >> PROBST: How much do you
648,00:36:50.46,00:36:50.46,scratch your heads at this? Because it's not like
649,00:36:52.04,00:36:52.04,you're taking on the same four people.
650,00:36:53.96,00:36:53.96,"You've taken on different combinations of Koror,"
651,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,"and every single time, they've whupped you."
652,00:36:58.92,00:36:58.92,"When you go back to camp and you're scratching your heads,"
653,00:37:01.12,00:37:01.12,what goes through your head in terms of what is it?
654,00:37:04.50,00:37:04.50,">> We don't... I mean, we don't come back,"
655,00:37:07.00,00:37:07.00,"you know, after... after a challenge,"
656,00:37:08.17,00:37:08.17,"after we lost, and start jumping up and down"
657,00:37:10.29,00:37:10.29,and giving each other high-fives on losing.
658,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,"This isn't fun to come here. I mean, I..."
659,00:37:14.62,00:37:14.62,"Jeff, I've been looking at myself all day thinking, I mean,"
660,00:37:16.96,00:37:16.96,"I might be the hex, I might be a curse."
661,00:37:19.54,00:37:19.54,You just don't know with this tribe.
662,00:37:21.38,00:37:21.38,>> PROBST: So what do you do tonight?
663,00:37:23.38,00:37:23.38,You guys have to be tight to some degree.
664,00:37:25.38,00:37:25.38,"You're all each other has. Bobby Jon, are you surprised how"
665,00:37:27.38,00:37:27.38,quickly you could become so close?
666,00:37:31.54,00:37:31.54,">> You know, like, I mean, I don't drink unless"
667,00:37:34.21,00:37:34.21,"you know, she went to the well. I don't get any coconuts"
668,00:37:37.42,00:37:37.42,unless he went to the tree and got them.
669,00:37:39.17,00:37:39.17,"I mean, like, you depend on each other,"
670,00:37:41.00,00:37:41.00,"and, like, we know which... what each other is thinking"
671,00:37:42.38,00:37:42.38,"a lot of times around camp. I mean, our camp"
672,00:37:44.71,00:37:44.71,"life is phenomenal. It's just, we haven't"
673,00:37:47.08,00:37:47.08,rose to the occasion. >> PROBST: So then when it comes
674,00:37:50.38,00:37:50.38,"down to writing somebody's name down tonight, Bobby Jon,"
675,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,"what do you base it on? >> Man, I tell you, Jeff, I'm"
676,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,not going to know until the last second I put that pen down
677,00:37:57.62,00:37:57.62,"on that piece of paper. >> PROBST: So, if it's Steph for"
678,00:38:00.04,00:38:00.04,"you, why? Why would you vote"
679,00:38:03.21,00:38:03.21,Steph out tonight? >> For a threat.
680,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,"That's why I'd vote Steph out, 'cause I think"
681,00:38:14.00,00:38:14.00,"she can go all the way. >> PROBST: Ibrehem, if you knew"
682,00:38:16.04,00:38:16.04,"it was you tonight, told you right now"
683,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,"you're the one going, anything you'd want to say"
684,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,to try and convince these guys otherwise?
685,00:38:23.62,00:38:23.62,">> I think because I'm a... I'm a really loyal person,"
686,00:38:26.00,00:38:26.00,I think that's one good thing about me.
687,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,"If I say I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it."
688,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,"I'm not a dishonest person, for the most part."
689,00:38:32.71,00:38:32.71,">> PROBST: So which is it, Steph?"
690,00:38:34.71,00:38:34.71,Is it... Are you voting tonight based on loyalty and friendship
691,00:38:37.67,00:38:37.67,"or are you voting on ""I want to stay in this game,"
692,00:38:40.08,00:38:40.08,"and I'm getting rid of the toughest guy""?"
693,00:38:42.04,00:38:42.04,>> I'm actually gonna... I think  I'm going to vote on
694,00:38:44.12,00:38:44.12,what I think would help me out as a strategy.
695,00:38:47.29,00:38:47.29,">> PROBST: Truth be told, are you worried tonight"
696,00:38:49.54,00:38:49.54,or are you feeling okay? >> 90% worried.
697,00:38:52.62,00:38:52.62,"I mean, it's just, you know, there's three of us."
698,00:38:55.42,00:38:55.42,Two guys who get along real well.
699,00:38:58.04,00:38:58.04,I get along with both of them. I respect both of them.
700,00:39:00.75,00:39:00.75,"We all work hard, but I feel really vulnerable."
701,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,"And it's, it's sad, 'cause I'm not ready to go."
702,00:39:10.25,00:39:10.25,">> PROBST: Bobby Jon, worried or are you in the driver's seat?"
703,00:39:14.42,00:39:14.42,>> To me right now is like me trying to put that
704,00:39:16.58,00:39:16.58,puzzle together today. It's tough because I think that
705,00:39:19.92,00:39:19.92,"I'm just as... I'm just as vulnerable, too,"
706,00:39:21.83,00:39:21.83,"Jeff. I mean, why, why should I stay,"
707,00:39:23.92,00:39:23.92,you know? Why should I stay over them?
708,00:39:26.12,00:39:26.12,"It's about to come down to it. Anything can happen,"
709,00:39:28.67,00:39:28.67,"anything can. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
710,00:39:32.67,00:39:32.67,"vote. Steph, you're up."
711,00:40:31.88,00:40:31.88,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
712,00:40:43.67,00:40:43.67,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
713,00:40:45.62,00:40:45.62,The person voted out will be asked to leave the
714,00:40:47.83,00:40:47.83,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
715,00:40:52.75,00:40:52.75,"First vote, Ibrehem."
716,00:41:00.67,00:41:00.67,"Steph. One vote Steph,"
717,00:41:02.42,00:41:02.42,one vote Ibrehem. One vote left.
718,00:41:10.21,00:41:10.21,Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Palau...
719,00:41:17.17,00:41:17.17,Ibrehem. You need to bring me your
720,00:41:19.17,00:41:19.17,torch. >> Good luck.
721,00:41:31.46,00:41:31.46,">> PROBST: Ibrehem, the tribe has spoken."
722,00:41:37.38,00:41:37.38,"It's time for you to go. >> See you, Ib."
723,00:41:50.25,00:41:50.25,">> PROBST: Well, here's the good news: In spite of the fact this"
724,00:41:54.25,00:41:54.25,"tribe of nine has been decimated, you two still believe"
725,00:41:56.83,00:41:56.83,in yourselves as a tribe. Don't lose that spirit.
726,00:42:02.25,00:42:02.25,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
727,00:42:19.21,00:42:19.21,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
728,00:42:25.04,00:42:25.04,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
729,00:42:27.08,00:42:27.08,>> Get out of here! >> PROBST: The rats move in
730,00:42:29.04,00:42:29.04,at Koror. >> Get out of here.
731,00:42:31.04,00:42:31.04,>> The rats have realized that we're not a threat to them.
732,00:42:32.79,00:42:32.79,>> Get out of here! >> PROBST: And Coby's had
733,00:42:34.79,00:42:34.79,enough... >> These girls don't do
734,00:42:36.50,00:42:36.50,anything. I want to take all three of
735,00:42:38.50,00:42:38.50,those girls and push them in that fire.
736,00:42:40.50,00:42:40.50,>> PROBST: ...while Ulong is down to two.
737,00:42:42.50,00:42:42.50,>> Bobby Jon is turning into a caveman.
738,00:42:44.50,00:42:44.50,( belches ) >> What can I say?
739,00:42:50.54,00:42:50.54,I totally didn't expect to be voted off tonight.
740,00:42:53.58,00:42:53.58,So it was a big surprise. I thought me
741,00:42:55.58,00:42:55.58,"and Bobby Jon had something,"
742,00:42:56.75,00:42:56.75,but I guess I was wrong.
743,00:42:58.54,00:42:58.54,I played the game the best way I felt
744,00:43:00.50,00:43:00.50,like I knew how without compromising
745,00:43:02.08,00:43:02.08,my character. I think I walk away
746,00:43:04.25,00:43:04.25,"with just a whole new respect for life,"
747,00:43:06.00,00:43:06.00,not taking things for granted. It was an experience
748,00:43:07.50,00:43:07.50,I definitely enjoyed.
