122,00:07:09.58,00:07:09.58,I think someone was saying lastnight that being here is like
123,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,"being in prison, because we donot have nearly enough food, and"
124,00:07:16.12,00:07:16.12,"then we have these unripe,disgusting plantains that when"

134,00:07:43.50,00:07:43.50,">> Those are definitely maggots.>> Eh, I'm eating it anyway."
135,00:07:47.17,00:07:47.17,"Everything was boiled.>> Boy, look at all that"

151,00:08:40.04,00:08:40.04,thinking.If it comes down to eating
152,00:08:41.79,00:08:41.79,"maggots, I'm going to eatmaggots."
153,00:08:43.71,00:08:43.71,"To me, if there was,they were cooked."
154,00:08:45.21,00:08:45.21,They're good. Protein.Eat 'em. Shut up.
155,00:08:49.42,00:08:49.42,"Sorority girls, like... likeScout calls 'em-- they're not"
156,00:08:54.29,00:08:54.29,mature enough.They're not physically strong
157,00:08:57.25,00:08:57.25,enough.They just...
158,00:08:59.25,00:08:59.25,they just wear me out.They just don't understand the
159,00:09:01.96,00:09:01.96,"game, I guess.If they want to be pampered,"
160,00:09:04.46,00:09:04.46,they need to go back to theHoliday Inn.

374,00:21:50.12,00:21:50.12,to work.But this is a game of non-trust.
375,00:21:53.46,00:21:53.46,"I view the first day coming in,do not trust anyone."
376,00:21:58.00,00:21:58.00,"Don't trust anybody.>> Well, it's going to"

585,00:32:04.58,00:32:04.58,"about Eliza is the fact that youtell her to do this,"
586,00:32:08.12,00:32:08.12,and she'll do it.I don't think she's looking out
587,00:32:10.00,00:32:10.00,for her best interests.I think she's looking out for
588,00:32:12.71,00:32:12.71,"everybody's interests, and it'sjust not possible in this game."

629,00:34:18.08,00:34:18.08,on my radar at all.>> Dolly told me that she
630,00:34:21.25,00:34:21.25,was definitely going to vote forLeann.
631,00:34:23.71,00:34:23.71,I nearly dropped my teeth.That just...

645,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"cookie crumbles, but it's kindof turned into this Dolly, Julie"
646,00:35:06.38,00:35:06.38,"and Mia are, like, running thewhole thing."
647,00:35:09.29,00:35:09.29,>> I don't like that at all.I-I don't like that at all.

670,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,"on me from both sides, that Ijust don't know what to do."
671,00:36:10.92,00:36:10.92,>> I know.All I want to know is that

673,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83,>> I think there is apossibility that she could vote
674,00:36:19.25,00:36:19.25,me off.That she would turn on me.
675,00:36:21.29,00:36:21.29,I just don't want the other fourgirls in that alliance to go
676,00:36:24.92,00:36:24.92,"blindsided.But then again, if I bring it up"
677,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,"to them and I tell them, look,I'm thinking of voting out"
