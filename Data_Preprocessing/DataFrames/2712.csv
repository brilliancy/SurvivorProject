366,00:25:39.53,00:25:39.53,>> YOU ROCKED THAT BALANCE BEAM. >> I'M IN A GREAT POSITION NO
367,00:25:43.43,00:25:43.43,MATTER WHICH WAY I PLAYTHINGS. I'M IN A SECURE ALLIANCE.
368,00:25:46.50,00:25:46.50,"ME, TYSON, MONICA, THE THREE, TOGETHER."
369,00:25:49.47,00:25:49.47,WE HAVE CIERA WHICH MAKES FOUR. WE PRETTY MUCH CONTROL THE GAME.
370,00:25:56.23,00:25:56.23,>> DO YOU HEAR THAT? >> ICE CREAM!
371,00:25:59.23,00:25:59.23,ICE CREAM! >> ICE CREAM!
372,00:26:02.73,00:26:02.73,">> ICE CREAM! >> ROOT BEER FLOAT, YEAH, I WANT"
373,00:26:12.33,00:26:12.33,"THAT. >> ME, TOO."
374,00:26:13.27,00:26:13.27,>> IS THAT A BEER? >> ROOT BEER.
375,00:26:17.53,00:26:17.53,>> DO THEY HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAMP?
376,00:26:21.00,00:26:21.00,>> GERVASE DECIDED TO CHOOSE MONICA AND TYSON TO EAT ICE
377,00:26:24.50,00:26:24.50,CREAM WITH THEM AND THAT LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN FOR ME TO TALK TO
378,00:26:27.73,00:26:27.73,"CIERA AND PITCH HER THE IDEA, HEY, CIERA, LET'S MAKE A MOVE"
379,00:26:31.63,00:26:31.63,HERE. >> SO SAY KATIE GOES HOME
380,00:26:36.23,00:26:36.23,TONIGHT OR I GO HOME TONIGHT. >> OKAY.
381,00:26:38.03,00:26:38.03,>> Jeff: WHO DO YOU HONESTLY THINK IS GOING TO GO HOME NEXT
382,00:26:41.40,00:26:41.40,WEEK? DO YOU THINK KATIE GOES HOME
383,00:26:43.17,00:26:43.17,NEXT WEEK? DO YOU THINK I GO HOME?
384,00:26:45.00,00:26:45.00,>> I THINK IT WOULD BE YOU. >> I THINK IT'S YOU.
385,00:26:47.47,00:26:47.47,">> Jeff: WELL, I MEAN, I WOULD LIKE -- I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE"
386,00:26:50.57,00:26:50.57,ONE OF YOU TWO. PART OF MY STRATEGY HAS BEEN
387,00:26:55.50,00:26:55.50,"MAKING HAYDEN AND KATIE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE, LIKE, A GLIMMER"
388,00:26:58.10,00:26:58.10,OF HOPE. BUT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF DOING
389,00:27:01.23,00:27:01.23,ANYTHING WITH HAYDEN AND KATIE. >> Jeff: YOU REALLY THINK
390,00:27:04.33,00:27:04.33,THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN? >> YES.
391,00:27:06.17,00:27:06.17,AND THAT'S MY HONEST OPINION. WHAT ARE YOU WANTING TO HAVE
392,00:27:10.90,00:27:10.90,"HAPPEN? >> I MEAN, I'M IN A TOUGH SPOT"
393,00:27:13.07,00:27:13.07,BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE ME MOST LIKELY.
394,00:27:14.93,00:27:14.93,>> OKAY. >> I GET THAT.
395,00:27:16.20,00:27:16.20,>> OKAY. >> BUT IF WE HAD THE MAJORITY
396,00:27:20.00,00:27:20.00,WOULD YOU MAKE A BIG MOVE? >> DEPENDS ON WHO YOUR MAJORITY
397,00:27:24.07,00:27:24.07,IS. >> GERVASE IS ON BOARD IF YOU'RE
398,00:27:27.43,00:27:27.43,ON BOARD. >> SO WHAT ARE YOU WANTING TO DO
399,00:27:29.47,00:27:29.47,AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW? >> HERE'S THE THING.
400,00:27:31.93,00:27:31.93,TYSON MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AN IDOL.
401,00:27:34.13,00:27:34.13,YOU CAN EITHER MAKE A STINK AT TRIBAL LIKE WE'RE GOING TO VOTE
402,00:27:37.83,00:27:37.83,OUT TYSON AND MAKE HIM FLUSH HIS IDOL AND VOTE OUT MONICA OR WE
403,00:27:41.57,00:27:41.57,CAN TRY AND BE SLY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RESUME TO WIN
404,00:27:49.00,00:27:49.00,AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE SAID YOU MADE A BIG MOVE AND THIS COULD
405,00:27:51.60,00:27:51.60,BE THAT FOR YOU. >> AND ALL I'M TELLING YOU IS --
406,00:27:54.53,00:27:54.53,"I MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VOTES RIGHT NOW, FOR ME TO VOTE"
407,00:27:57.63,00:27:57.63,WITH YOU GUYS TWAOUB 3-3 VOTE AND I'M NOT DOING THAT.
408,00:28:02.53,00:28:02.53,>> Jeff: GERVASE AND CIERA RIGHT NOW CAN MAKE A HUGE MOVE
409,00:28:05.40,00:28:05.40,AND GET OUT TYSON. IF THEY MAKE THIS MOVE THEY
410,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,PROBABLY DESERVE TO WIN THIS GAME.
411,00:28:10.03,00:28:10.03,">> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU BOTH."
412,00:28:15.27,00:28:15.27,YOU DON'T WANT SECOND PLACE. YOU DON'T WANT SECOND PLACE.
413,00:28:18.93,00:28:18.93,IF WE ALL VOTE TOGETHER WE HAVE FOUR.
414,00:28:23.33,00:28:23.33,"THE THREE OF US, KATIE, TYSON WILL NEVER SEE IT COMING."
415,00:28:27.90,00:28:27.90,TYSON GOES HOME. NEXT WEEK KATIE GOES HOME.
416,00:28:32.43,00:28:32.43,"IT'S A HUGE MOVE. IF YOU WANT TO GET HIM OUT, IT'S"
417,00:28:36.30,00:28:36.30,THIS TRIBAL RIGHT NOW. HE'S NOT EXPECTING IT.
418,00:28:38.80,00:28:38.80,>> HE HAS THE NUMBERS. >> HE HAS THE NUMBERS BUT HE
419,00:28:42.07,00:28:42.07,KNOWS THAT NOBODY -- HE KNOWS EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THEY'RE
420,00:28:45.27,00:28:45.27,GOING TO LOSE HIM-TO-HIM IN THE END-- WHICH THEY ARE.
421,00:28:47.53,00:28:47.53,>> I THINK I HAVE A CHANCE TO BEAT TYSON BECAUSE TYSON HAS
422,00:28:50.53,00:28:50.53,"DONE THE SAME CRIMES. >> HE HAS, BUT HE'S PLAYED THE"
423,00:28:53.53,00:28:53.53,GAME. >> TONIGHT IS SIMPLE: HAYDEN'S
424,00:28:55.43,00:28:55.43,GOT TO GO AND THEN THANK GOODNESS IT CAN BE KATIE NEXT.
425,00:28:59.47,00:28:59.47,I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S STILL AROUND.
426,00:29:00.90,00:29:00.90,>> I AGREE WITH GERV. KATIE HAS JUST A BIG A SHOT OF
427,00:29:06.10,00:29:06.10,"ME AT THE END AND YOU, DO, TOO. >> YOU WANT TO WIN FIRST PLACE."
428,00:29:10.43,00:29:10.43,YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE END AND GET SECOND OR THIRD?
429,00:29:13.90,00:29:13.90,SECOND PLACE IS THE FIRST LOSER. >> WHAT I WAS HOPING WAS CIERA
430,00:29:17.07,00:29:17.07,AND GERVASE WERE GOING TO ROLL WITH ME TO BLIND SIDE TYSON AND
431,00:29:20.57,00:29:20.57,THEY'RE NOT DOING IT. I DON'T LIKE TO LOSE.
432,00:29:22.63,00:29:22.63,I'M THE WORST -- THE WORST LOSER.
433,00:29:27.03,00:29:27.03,"GOT! TYSON, I'M SITTING HERE TRYING"
434,00:29:31.53,00:29:31.53,TO CONVINCE EVERYONE TO BLIND SIDE YOU.
435,00:29:33.27,00:29:33.27,IT'S NOT -- IT HASN'T WORKED. >> GOOD.
436,00:29:36.37,00:29:36.37,">> YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME."
437,00:29:39.70,00:29:39.70,>> I KNOW. I KNOW YOU ARE.
438,00:29:41.33,00:29:41.33,>> YUP. >> THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.
439,00:29:53.43,00:29:53.43,">> TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO INTO TRIBAL GUNS BLAZING."
440,00:29:57.13,00:29:57.13,I'M GOING TO GO IT N AND BLOW IT UP.
441,00:29:59.93,00:29:59.93,LET THINGS FLY. GO DOWN SWINGING.
442,00:30:01.83,00:30:01.83,MAYBE IT WON'T BE ME. WE'LL SEE.
443,00:30:03.50,00:30:03.50,WE WILL SEE. THE CHAPTER IS NOT CLOSED YET.
444,00:30:22.30,00:30:22.30,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
445,00:30:26.77,00:30:26.77,"ARAS, VYTAS, AND CALEB. OKAY, SO AT THE LAST TRIBAL"
446,00:30:34.30,00:30:34.30,"COUNCIL THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR DIVISION OF GERVASE, MONICA,"
447,00:30:38.00,00:30:38.00,"TYSON, AND CIERA AND THEN IT WAS HAYDEN, KATIE AND CALEB WHO WAS"
448,00:30:42.90,00:30:42.90,"VOTED OUT. SO, HAYDEN, IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME"
449,00:30:46.13,00:30:46.13,IT'S STILL THAT DIVISION ONLY NOW IT'S 4-2?
450,00:30:48.57,00:30:48.57,>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THE FOUR OF THEM ARE BEING
451,00:30:51.03,00:30:51.03,CONTROLLED BY TYSON. THE TWO OF US ARE ON OUR OWN.
452,00:30:55.30,00:30:55.30,">> Jeff: BOY, THOSE ARE BIG WORDS, CIERA."
453,00:30:57.60,00:30:57.60,HE JUST SAID YOU WERE BEING CONTROLLED BY TYSON.
454,00:30:59.63,00:30:59.63,>> YEAH. LET HIM THINK WHAT HE WANTS TO
455,00:31:02.27,00:31:02.27,THINK. I'M COMFORTABLE IN MY POSITION
456,00:31:03.70,00:31:03.70,WITH MY ALLIANCE. >> Jeff: ALTHOUGH YOU WEREN'T
457,00:31:06.40,00:31:06.40,CHOSEN TODAY BY GERVASE AS PART OF THE REWARD.
458,00:31:08.57,00:31:08.57,>> I THINK HIS DECISION WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT I HAVE
459,00:31:11.80,00:31:11.80,BEEN ABLE TO BE A PART OF A LOT OF THE FOOD REWARDS SO I DIDN'T
460,00:31:14.93,00:31:14.93,TAKE ANY OFFENSE TO IT. >> IT'S OBVIOUS THE TWO PEOPLE
461,00:31:18.13,00:31:18.13,ARE CHOSE ARE ORIGINAL TKPWA LANG MEMBERS.
462,00:31:21.37,00:31:21.37,I PUT MY BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS IN THIS GAME.

464,00:31:28.83,00:31:28.83,TYSON AND MONICA. NOT SO GOOD IF YOU'RE CIERA.
465,00:31:31.60,00:31:31.60,">> I AGREE 100%. >> Jeff: HAYDEN, THIS IS THE"
466,00:31:34.77,00:31:34.77,OPPORTUNITY YOU NEED BECAUSE YOU AND KATIE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.
467,00:31:38.00,00:31:38.00,"IF YOU CAN SWAY CIERA TO GO 3-3, NOW WE HAVE A NEW GAME."

473,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,>> NO. AND ACTUALLY HAYDEN AND CALEB
474,00:31:59.33,00:31:59.33,WERWERE THE ONES WHO SAID THEY WANTED TO VOTE MY MOM OUT.
475,00:32:02.93,00:32:02.93,">> Jeff: KATIE, WHERE DO YOU FIT IN IN ALL THIS?"

482,00:32:21.20,00:32:21.20,"PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. >> Jeff: MONICA, WHY WOULD IT"
483,00:32:25.67,00:32:25.67,MAKE SENSE FOR CIERA TO SAY THAT TYSON MONICA GERVASE TRIO ARE
484,00:32:30.33,00:32:30.33,"TIGHT, MAYBE I NEED GO WITH HAYDEN AND KATIE AND HAVE A SHOT"
485,00:32:33.57,00:32:33.57,TO THE END? >> THAT'S A BAD MOVE.
486,00:32:35.57,00:32:35.57,BECAUSE FOUR IS BETTER THAN SIX. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF
487,00:32:39.70,00:32:39.70,PROMISES HAVE BEEN MADE TO PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE AT THIS
488,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00,POINT START TO THINK ABOUT WHO CAN I BEAT?

492,00:32:55.37,00:32:55.37,"THERE'S ONE, TWO AND THREE. OR ONE, TWO, AND THREE."
493,00:32:58.13,00:32:58.13,HOWEVER YOU FRAME IT. >> THAT'S INCORRECT.
494,00:33:00.60,00:33:00.60,>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT'S INCORRECT?
495,00:33:03.20,00:33:03.20,">> WHAT SHE HAS ON THAT SIDE IS A BACK STABBER, A BACK STABBER,"
