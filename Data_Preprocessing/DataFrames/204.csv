6,00:00:13.17,00:00:13.17,Colby whispered sweet nothings to each other

8,00:00:17.53,00:00:17.53,>> JERRI: Cream and sugar. I'm such a sucker for cowboys.

12,00:00:29.40,00:00:29.40,when Jerri made it clear who her friends were.
13,00:00:31.43,00:00:31.43,>> JERRI: I've been very fortunate in my ability to bond
14,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,"with Amber, Mitchell and Colby. >> JEFF: But there was no bond"
15,00:00:38.57,00:00:38.57,"with Maralyn, who was voted out of the tribe."
16,00:00:40.87,00:00:40.87,It's time for you to go. 13 remain.
17,00:00:43.93,00:00:43.93,"Tonight, one more will go. >> TINA: I had slept outside"
18,00:02:01.73,00:02:01.73,"last night, as did Keith. We were the first ones up, so we"
19,00:02:04.60,00:02:04.60,"thought the first ones up, let's just get up and go fishing this"
20,00:02:06.37,00:02:06.37,morning. So we cleared everything off the
21,00:02:09.83,00:02:09.83,"boat, got the fishing rods together."
22,00:02:13.57,00:02:13.57,"Jerri popped up out of the tent, ran, turned over the canoe..."
23,00:02:17.87,00:02:17.87,and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.
24,00:02:21.80,00:02:21.80,>> MITCHELL: You guys wanna go? ( canister rattling )
25,00:02:27.50,00:02:27.50,You're going to take this? >> KEITH: Yeah.
26,00:02:29.63,00:02:29.63,"Jerri and the others, they wanted to take the canoe out."
27,00:02:31.60,00:02:31.60,"You know, we said, ""Well, we're just getting ourselves ready,"

29,00:02:36.80,00:02:36.80,"""Oh, we were going to do that."" Well, isn't that ironic, you"
30,00:02:39.17,00:02:39.17,"know, just 'cause we were going to go?"

33,00:02:45.90,00:02:45.90,"I just said ""Look, you know, we were gonna go fishing."
34,00:02:48.13,00:02:48.13,"You all were asleep. We're going to go fishing."""
35,00:02:50.47,00:02:50.47,"And apparently, Keith wanted to have a talk with me, so he said,"
36,00:02:53.23,00:02:53.23,"""Well, Tina, let's just go walk along the bank and fish that"
37,00:02:55.13,00:02:55.13,"way."" >> KEITH: At Tribal Council last"
38,00:02:59.50,00:02:59.50,"night, Tina and I had an opportunity to get a little bit"
39,00:03:02.03,00:03:02.03,better understanding of where we sit within our own tribe.
40,00:03:04.50,00:03:04.50,"When Jerri was asked the question who her friends are,"
41,00:03:07.03,00:03:07.03,"she made a point of mentioning Amber, Colby, Mitchell and"
42,00:03:09.80,00:03:09.80,"herself, that they all get along best."
43,00:03:11.30,00:03:11.30,"And then, of course, she wanted to make sure that everybody was"
44,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,clear that she was here to win the money.
45,00:03:15.97,00:03:15.97,And she's going to do whatever she has to to win the money.
46,00:03:18.60,00:03:18.60,"So, Tina and I were a little miffed by that."
47,00:03:21.67,00:03:21.67,>> TINA: You have four or five young people playing.
48,00:03:25.17,00:03:25.17,"You know, they've got so much chemistry that it is almost"
49,00:03:29.07,00:03:29.07,second nature just to-- whoo-- just immediately gravitate
50,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of
51,00:03:36.27,00:03:36.27,"like an outsider, which I am an outsider at this point."
52,00:03:40.90,00:03:40.90,>> JERRI: It's all I can do to keep from just laughing out
53,00:03:43.57,00:03:43.57,"loud. At Tribal Council, Jeff asked me"
54,00:03:48.63,00:03:48.63,who I felt I had built friendships with.
55,00:03:52.73,00:03:52.73,"And immediately after I said it, I kind of sucked it back up,"
56,00:03:55.53,00:03:55.53,because I realized I was basically challenging people to
57,00:03:57.17,00:03:57.17,vote for me. Which doesn't put me in a very
58,00:03:59.37,00:03:59.37,good position. >> KEITH: Jerri is perfect for
59,00:04:04.60,00:04:04.60,this game. She will ride the team until
60,00:04:07.93,00:04:07.93,it's time to take the knife out and cut someone's throat.
61,00:04:11.63,00:04:11.63,>> JERRI: That was good stuff. >> KEITH: I didn't come out here
62,00:04:15.10,00:04:15.10,to be pushed around by a bartender-wannabe-actress.
63,00:04:18.07,00:04:18.07,Maybe it's time just to shake her world up a little bit.
64,00:04:22.33,00:04:22.33,I can tell you one thing: Tina and I are not going to go down
65,00:04:24.70,00:04:24.70,"without a fight. I came here to win the money,"
66,00:04:26.93,00:04:26.93,"but now my motive isn't to win the money, but to do everything"
67,00:04:29.63,00:04:29.63,I can to make sure she does not win the money.
68,00:04:45.27,00:04:45.27,">> ALICIA: Wow, what is it? >> RODGER: I have no idea."
69,00:04:48.47,00:04:48.47,>> ALICIA: You guys are not going to believe this one.
70,00:04:50.87,00:04:50.87,>> KIMMI: What? >> RODGER: We got a chicken egg.
71,00:04:53.43,00:04:53.43,">> ALICIA: We have a real egg. >> RODGER: ""For a change of the"
72,00:04:56.97,00:04:56.97,"menu, you must work with great haste."
73,00:04:59.80,00:04:59.80,"Build a pen on your beach, and slide the pieces in place."""
74,00:05:06.80,00:05:06.80,"This morning, we received tree mail."
75,00:05:08.87,00:05:08.87,"And I went out there to it, and it was a bird's nest."
76,00:05:12.47,00:05:12.47,And it involves a challenge of building a chicken coop.
77,00:05:15.97,00:05:15.97,>> ALICIA: Grab one end. ( indistinct voices )
78,00:05:20.50,00:05:20.50,">> KIMMI: Okay, all of these are pretty much straight."
79,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,"I definitely have to appear that I'm into this challenge, because"
80,00:05:26.33,00:05:26.33,"my head was on the chopping block-- I know, with a couple of"
81,00:05:29.33,00:05:29.33,"people-- because of, um... you know, my almost not eating the"
82,00:05:32.30,00:05:32.30,worm and the cow brain thing. At least this chicken coop thing
83,00:05:35.93,00:05:35.93,is a little bit of a change of pace.
84,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,"I know it might seem ironic, because I don't eat mammals."
85,00:05:40.00,00:05:40.00,"You know, I haven't had poultry in over ten years, and I haven't"
86,00:05:42.97,00:05:42.97,"had red meat in over 15 years, but if it boosts up morale for"
87,00:05:45.90,00:05:45.90,"these guys, it's going to be good."
88,00:05:47.10,00:05:47.10,">> NICK: Oh, yeah. >> MICHAEL: See, what I can do"
89,00:05:49.57,00:05:49.57,is I can pry this over with my pry bar here...
90,00:05:51.57,00:05:51.57,>> JEFF V.: I want those chickens so bad.
91,00:05:53.70,00:05:53.70,"For one reason, so Mike will quit fishing and walking around"
92,00:05:56.40,00:05:56.40,here flexing his muscle. I really want chicken.
93,00:05:59.73,00:05:59.73,And I'm not above snatching it out of the other team's arms.
94,00:06:02.80,00:06:02.80,"I want a chicken. >> JEFF: Okay, today's challenge"
95,00:06:19.60,00:06:19.60,is a reward challenge. And the map to your reward is
96,00:06:23.30,00:06:23.30,scrambled in a puzzle. The first tribe to completely
97,00:06:27.10,00:06:27.10,unscramble their puzzle gets three egg-laying chickens and
98,00:06:31.00,00:06:31.00,"one rooster. Big reward, a lot of eggs."

186,00:12:15.50,00:12:15.50,>> MITCHELL: Yeah. >> TINA: She sees that we've got
187,00:12:18.30,00:12:18.30,"the fishing poles out, jumps out, grabs the boat, turns it"
188,00:12:20.00,00:12:20.00,over. And it's like she has to have
189,00:12:21.83,00:12:21.83,her way. >> COLBY: Yeah.
190,00:12:24.33,00:12:24.33,">> TINA: And I am so over it, I just can't hardly stand it."
191,00:12:27.37,00:12:27.37,I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building.
192,00:12:30.43,00:12:30.43,I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same
193,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,way I feel? >> COLBY: It's going to get a
194,00:12:36.03,00:12:36.03,lot worse before it gets better. >> TINA: I'm sorry.
195,00:12:38.37,00:12:38.37,"She's the most bossy, domineering person I've ever"
196,00:12:39.73,00:12:39.73,"met. >> COLBY: She's coming, by the"
197,00:12:41.37,00:12:41.37,way. >> MITCHELL: Mm-hmm.
198,00:12:45.17,00:12:45.17,( sighs ) >> TINA: It was a little bit of
199,00:12:48.87,00:12:48.87,it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby
200,00:12:51.90,00:12:51.90,"align with Jerri. And my thought was, if I could"
201,00:12:55.13,00:12:55.13,"get Colby, that would be two of us."
202,00:12:57.03,00:12:57.03,"And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber, and that would be the"
203,00:13:01.10,00:13:01.10,only chance that I would have to make it.
204,00:13:03.20,00:13:03.20,"At this point, I don't have anything to lose."
205,00:13:10.50,00:13:10.50,>> COLBY: I had to get out of the tent.
206,00:13:12.17,00:13:12.17,"There's a little estrogen overload in the tent right now,"
207,00:13:15.43,00:13:15.43,and I just couldn't deal with that.
208,00:13:17.33,00:13:17.33,Tina was taking things way too personally.
209,00:13:19.23,00:13:19.23,>> KEITH: What happened last night at Tribal Council is what
210,00:13:21.83,00:13:21.83,"really set Tina and I apart. Jeff said, ""Well, who are your"
211,00:13:24.43,00:13:24.43,"friends?"" and Jerri named, you know, four individuals."
212,00:13:26.53,00:13:26.53,>> COLBY: Right. >> KEITH: And Tina and I are
213,00:13:28.63,00:13:28.63,"sitting on the sideline. So that was, you know..."
214,00:13:30.87,00:13:30.87,"Tina and I just figured, ""Well, it's just a matter of time now."""
215,00:13:34.73,00:13:34.73,>> COLBY: The powers that be have predetermined long ago the
216,00:13:38.53,00:13:38.53,"pecking order here, and also the elimination order."
217,00:13:42.50,00:13:42.50,"And, uh, Keith is up. Keith and I have spent a lot of"
218,00:13:45.07,00:13:45.07,time together. Part of my reason for doing it--
219,00:13:47.40,00:13:47.40,"one, we get along. Two, we need Keith right now, so"
220,00:13:50.07,00:13:50.07,the last thing I'm going to do is alienate him.
221,00:13:52.30,00:13:52.30,>> KEITH: I'm cohabiting with people who... what do I do with
222,00:13:54.67,00:13:54.67,these people? >> COLBY: Yep.
223,00:13:57.03,00:13:57.03,">> KEITH: Who knows, man? You and Jerri could get married."
224,00:13:59.67,00:13:59.67,>> COLBY: I know that ain't happening.

228,00:14:08.07,00:14:08.07,she ain't no way good enough for you.
229,00:14:09.50,00:14:09.50,>> COLBY ( laughs ): That's funny.
230,00:14:10.73,00:14:10.73,>> KEITH: I would beat you like a dog if I found out you two
231,00:14:12.27,00:14:12.27,"hooked up. >> COLBY ( laughs ): Well,"
232,00:14:13.90,00:14:13.90,"thanks, bro. >> KEITH: That girl would cut"
233,00:14:16.17,00:14:16.17,"your throat in a heartbeat. >> COLBY: Yeah, you're right."

235,00:14:24.23,00:14:24.23,same wavelength-- we want to have chicken today.

237,00:14:29.63,00:14:29.63,"Elisabeth said yes. And if us four are saying yes,"
238,00:14:32.30,00:14:32.30,everybody says yes. >> KIMMI: I say no. Okay.
239,00:14:36.03,00:14:36.03,( sputtering laughter ) I guess that doesn't work.
240,00:14:38.37,00:14:38.37,>> ALICIA: Nope. I say do it whenever you want to do it.
241,00:14:40.57,00:14:40.57,"Just let me know when. >> KIMMI: Yeah, 'cause I want to"
242,00:14:41.90,00:14:41.90,"know... >> RODGER: Well, we've got to"
243,00:14:44.30,00:14:44.30,get the water going. I would love to have fried
244,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,chicken tonight. It would be the first meal where
245,00:14:48.43,00:14:48.43,we didn't have to pass a piece of fish around six or seven
246,00:14:51.00,00:14:51.00,times and everybody take a bite of it.
247,00:14:52.37,00:14:52.37,Everybody would have their own piece of chicken.
248,00:14:56.60,00:14:56.60,">> MICHAEL: Oh, it's boiling. >> RODGER: Boiling?"
249,00:14:58.30,00:14:58.30,>> MICHAEL: Boiling. Rodger...
250,00:15:04.17,00:15:04.17,Do we need anything besides tools?
251,00:15:06.70,00:15:06.70,>> RODGER: Just a hatchet and a block of wood.
252,00:15:11.77,00:15:11.77,">> KIMMI: Alicia, I'm leaving. >> ALICIA: Bye, sweetie."
253,00:15:19.30,00:15:19.30,I know it's harder for her. >> RODGER: Just gotta look at
254,00:15:27.67,00:15:27.67,"it, it's no different than eating them fish we've been"
255,00:15:29.50,00:15:29.50,eating. I'm gonna hold his wings.
256,00:15:33.37,00:15:33.37,"Just-just make it a good... one good, clean blow."
257,00:15:37.53,00:15:37.53,"( gentle crunching ) >> ALICIA: Mm, mm, mm!"
258,00:15:43.30,00:15:43.30,>> MICHAEL: Everybody was loving the chickens.
259,00:15:45.90,00:15:45.90,"This could be the end of the game for me, because they no"
260,00:15:50.10,00:15:50.10,longer need me for a food source.
261,00:15:52.30,00:15:52.30,It ups the stakes definitely for me to catch the food.
262,00:15:57.13,00:15:57.13,But to stay in the limelight is going to be harder and harder
263,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,because you've got to keep one- upping yourself.
264,00:16:03.50,00:16:03.50,"I caught one fish, and then I caught a bigger one, then I"
265,00:16:06.53,00:16:06.53,"caught three fish, then I caught five fish."
266,00:16:08.17,00:16:08.17,"What am I going to do now, wrestle an alligator?"
267,00:16:10.23,00:16:10.23,( laughs ) >> JEFF V.: I'll take a chicken
268,00:16:12.83,00:16:12.83,"over fish any day. >> NICK: Once you go dark meat,"
269,00:16:15.23,00:16:15.23,you don't ever go back. ( laughing )

271,00:16:35.43,00:16:35.43,"I'm hungry, I'm tired, physically, emotionally, I'm"
272,00:16:37.73,00:16:37.73,gone. I feel that I think the most
273,00:16:42.03,00:16:42.03,"about strategies, 'cause first of all, I don't have much else"
274,00:16:43.97,00:16:43.97,"to think about. And second of all, I want to go"
275,00:16:46.33,00:16:46.33,far with this. After seeing Colby and Keith
276,00:16:50.00,00:16:50.00,"talking over in the water for a couple of hours, who knows what"
277,00:16:53.30,00:16:53.30,"he's trying to convince Colby, but you know what?"
278,00:16:55.87,00:16:55.87,Maybe he's just kind of taking Keith for a ride.
279,00:16:58.57,00:16:58.57,Colby had been talking a lot to Keith.
280,00:17:00.43,00:17:00.43,We know Keith is trying to rear something up from behind to try
281,00:17:03.40,00:17:03.40,to take one of us out. >> JERRI: The only way it would
282,00:17:06.47,00:17:06.47,work is if Keith convinced Tina and Colby...
283,00:17:08.67,00:17:08.67,>> AMBER: And Colby. >> JERRI: ...to vote against me.
284,00:17:11.07,00:17:11.07,">> AMBER: Right, then... >> JERRI: And you and us three"
285,00:17:13.47,00:17:13.47,voted against Keith. It would be three and three.
286,00:17:15.60,00:17:15.60,>> AMBER: A tie. >> JERRI: And then you and me
287,00:17:18.03,00:17:18.03,"with the most votes, I'd be gone."
288,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10,>> AMBER: Yep. >> JERRI: This is definitely the
289,00:17:22.57,00:17:22.57,first time I've felt a little bit threatened.
290,00:17:24.87,00:17:24.87,And I guess I deserve it after making that pompous remark at
291,00:17:27.80,00:17:27.80,Tribal Council. >> AMBER: Colby could be talked
292,00:17:31.57,00:17:31.57,"into things easily. >> JERRI: Yeah, that's what I'm"
293,00:17:34.23,00:17:34.23,"thinking, too. >> AMBER: He's not real strong"
294,00:17:36.67,00:17:36.67,in his opinion. He-he sways a lot between what
295,00:17:39.20,00:17:39.20,people tell him. >> JERRI: Colby does seem to be
296,00:17:41.93,00:17:41.93,the one we're focused on in trying to ensure he's not
297,00:17:44.70,00:17:44.70,changing his mind. Ah...
298,00:17:59.57,00:17:59.57,There he is. Did you find a good spear?
299,00:18:02.53,00:18:02.53,">> COLBY: Yeah, I made a couple. >> JERRI: Yeah?"
300,00:18:04.63,00:18:04.63,Cool. Colby was pretty excited about
301,00:18:08.23,00:18:08.23,going out hunting for a pig. And I think it's a brilliant
302,00:18:11.80,00:18:11.80,"idea, especially with the fires right now, 'cause a lot of"
303,00:18:15.57,00:18:15.57,wildlife has been flushed this way.
304,00:18:18.63,00:18:18.63,Fire pretty much stopped. It's always a possibility that
305,00:18:21.80,00:18:21.80,it could jump the river and come over here.
306,00:18:23.60,00:18:23.60,"I think it's highly unlikely because there's no wind,"
307,00:18:25.20,00:18:25.20,nothing. >> COLBY: See where all the
308,00:18:30.10,00:18:30.10,ground's burning right there? >> JERRI: Yeah.
309,00:18:31.90,00:18:31.90,>> COLBY: The fire was right there. See? It was right there.
310,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,>> JERRI: Oh! >> COLBY: We'll walk back.
311,00:18:35.93,00:18:35.93,We'd love to have a hog around here.
312,00:18:37.77,00:18:37.77,"They're here. We've just got to find them, and I'm not"
313,00:18:39.73,00:18:39.73,having a whole lot of luck. But I'm bound and determined to
314,00:18:41.83,00:18:41.83,put pork on the plate before I leave this place.
315,00:18:44.93,00:18:44.93,"I mean, they're not going to live on the water, I don't"
316,00:18:46.53,00:18:46.53,think. They're going to burrow back
317,00:18:49.53,00:18:49.53,"aways, and I mean, I don't have a whole lot of experience with"
318,00:18:51.37,00:18:51.37,hogs. >> JERRI: I think Colby is
319,00:18:54.70,00:18:54.70,definitely separating the game from any relationship with me.
320,00:18:58.57,00:18:58.57,"I think it takes a strong person to do that, quite honestly,"
321,00:19:02.27,00:19:02.27,"especially when there's obviously, you know, some"
322,00:19:05.33,00:19:05.33,"attraction between us. >> JERRI: Where to, cowboy?"
323,00:19:08.43,00:19:08.43,>> COLBY: I don't know. We'll head this way.
324,00:19:11.43,00:19:11.43,Who knows where the heck we're going.
325,00:19:13.20,00:19:13.20,Jerri's scared. She's worried that Keith and
326,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,Tina and I are going to join together and mastermind a back
327,00:19:19.87,00:19:19.87,door move to get rid of her. I don't want you to lose an
328,00:19:23.37,00:19:23.37,ounce of sleep worrying about what Tina's thinking or doing or
329,00:19:27.07,00:19:27.07,anything like that. >> JERRI: I'm not losing any
330,00:19:28.70,00:19:28.70,sleep. I'm just... I just know that
331,00:19:31.73,00:19:31.73,she's thinking ahead. I just want to beat her to the
332,00:19:34.43,00:19:34.43,"draw, that's all. >> COLBY: I'm not saying I'm"
333,00:19:37.10,00:19:37.10,holding out on making a deal with you to see how this thing
334,00:19:39.00,00:19:39.00,plays out. I'm saying there's no sense in
335,00:19:42.57,00:19:42.57,"even making a deal, 'cause if we go into the merge undermanned,"
336,00:19:45.93,00:19:45.93,"it's all for naught, you know? >> JERRI: Don't worry about it."
337,00:19:49.27,00:19:49.27,"You know, it's not like you're making a deal with the devil"
338,00:19:51.10,00:19:51.10,"here. I'm a little leery of Colby, and"
339,00:19:55.73,00:19:55.73,I can tell actually that he's sort of distancing himself from
340,00:19:59.20,00:19:59.20,"me a lot more. And I like hanging out with you,"
341,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53,"so, you know, it just makes sense to me... to approach you"
342,00:20:08.37,00:20:08.37,with it. >> COLBY: I'll make you a deal.
343,00:20:11.40,00:20:11.40,"It's me, you and Amber through to the end."
344,00:20:13.57,00:20:13.57,>> JERRI: Make me a deal? What is that?!
345,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,">> COLBY: Well, you were wanting to strike a deal earlier."
346,00:20:18.90,00:20:18.90,"Jerri probably wears a name tag that says ""puppet master"" on it."
347,00:20:22.33,00:20:22.33,"She loves having Amber in her hip pocket, and Mitchell in the"
348,00:20:24.27,00:20:24.27,"same place. I mean, I simply agreed to go"
349,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,along with them just because I thought it could get me down the
350,00:20:31.10,00:20:31.10,road a little better. It's all good.
351,00:20:33.23,00:20:33.23,"( Jerri laughs ) I want to win, and I don't"
352,00:20:35.97,00:20:35.97,want to talk to anybody else about loyalties.
353,00:20:38.30,00:20:38.30,Don't give me that crap. I haven't trusted anyone since
354,00:20:41.33,00:20:41.33,"day one, and anyone playing smart should have been the same"

550,00:35:10.50,00:35:10.50,"Kucha is kicking your ass, and the question I have is: Does it"
551,00:35:15.37,00:35:15.37,change your strategy tonight at all in thinking about what tribe
552,00:35:19.07,00:35:19.07,do we need to take to this merge?
553,00:35:22.20,00:35:22.20,">> TINA: That's the hardest part about this game, because you are"
554,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77,pulled in so many different directions.
555,00:35:28.53,00:35:28.53,"You're pulled with loyalty, you're pulled with self-"
556,00:35:31.30,00:35:31.30,"survival, you're pulled with team survival."
557,00:35:33.93,00:35:33.93,And it boils down to you. You're going to have to be the
558,00:35:36.93,00:35:36.93,one to make the decision. And... it's brutal.
559,00:35:39.93,00:35:39.93,">> JEFF: Well, obviously, tonight's vote is pivotal."
560,00:35:42.57,00:35:42.57,"Behind me, three torches. Two of the three-- Ogakor."
561,00:35:47.87,00:35:47.87,"It's time to vote. Colby. >> MITCHELL: Keith, you add some"
562,00:36:23.60,00:36:23.60,"tensions with the group at times, and my hope is that by"
563,00:36:27.60,00:36:27.60,"eliminating you, we eliminate a little bit of that friction."
564,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,>> TINA: This was not my original intended vote.
565,00:36:57.30,00:36:57.30,"However, on the way here to Tribal Council, a new scheme was"
566,00:37:01.47,00:37:01.47,"developed. So, in the spirit of the"
567,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,"Olympics, let the games begin. >> JEFF: I'll go tally your"
568,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,"votes. Once the votes are tallied, the"
569,00:37:36.83,00:37:36.83,decision is final. The person will be asked to
570,00:37:39.70,00:37:39.70,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
571,00:37:42.40,00:37:42.40,First vote: Keith. Keith.
572,00:37:56.60,00:37:56.60,"Keith. Three votes, Keith."
573,00:38:04.80,00:38:04.80,Mitchell. Mitchell.
574,00:38:13.43,00:38:13.43,"Three votes Keith, two votes Mitchell."
575,00:38:21.47,00:38:21.47,"We have a tie. Okay, our first tie."
576,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,"Here's how it'll work: Keith, Mitchell, you will not vote."
577,00:38:34.83,00:38:34.83,"The other four will vote again. Obviously, big vote for Ogakor."
578,00:38:40.20,00:38:40.20,I think it's only fair that I give each of you guys a chance
579,00:38:43.60,00:38:43.60,"to plead your case, a chance to say to the tribe why they need"
580,00:38:46.43,00:38:46.43,you to be to beat Kucha. Keith?
581,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,>> KEITH: I'm a competitor and I will fight to the bitter end to
582,00:38:54.77,00:38:54.77,win for this team and continue to do the heavy work that I've
583,00:38:58.60,00:38:58.60,contributed with the team thus far.
584,00:39:01.33,00:39:01.33,"I won't give up. >> JEFF: Mitchell, why should"
585,00:39:05.57,00:39:05.57,they keep you? ( sharp exhale )
586,00:39:09.13,00:39:09.13,">> MITCHELL: We all pulled a little fast one on me, but..."
587,00:39:12.60,00:39:12.60,"but I agree with Keith, actually."
588,00:39:15.30,00:39:15.30,I want you guys to win this. I want you guys to go on.
589,00:39:17.77,00:39:17.77,"I want you guys to beat Kucha. And physically, mentally,"
590,00:39:21.90,00:39:21.90,"emotionally, I'm drained. I wanted very, very badly to go"
591,00:39:26.60,00:39:26.60,"far in this game, but if these next few challenges are strictly"
592,00:39:30.80,00:39:30.80,"strength, Keith is stronger than I am."
593,00:39:33.70,00:39:33.70,I can't compete with that. There's no way I can compete
594,00:39:35.87,00:39:35.87,with that. >> JEFF: Okay.
595,00:39:37.10,00:39:37.10,We'll have a revote. You will vote for either Keith
596,00:39:39.27,00:39:39.27,or Mitchell. You are voting to vote them out
597,00:39:43.50,00:39:43.50,"of the tribe. All rules stay the same, but you"
598,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,have to vote for one of the two. Jerri.
599,00:39:57.90,00:39:57.90,">> JERRI: Mitchell, I promised you from the very beginning of"
600,00:40:00.60,00:40:00.60,"this game that I would not vote for you, and I am staying true"
601,00:40:02.67,00:40:02.67,to that promise. >> TINA: This game isn't easy.
602,00:40:30.37,00:40:30.37,I didn't come out here to starve myself and to face the elements
603,00:40:33.93,00:40:33.93,to keep the weakest person. >> JEFF: I'll read the tie-
604,00:40:45.40,00:40:45.40,breaker votes. Keith.
605,00:40:57.10,00:40:57.10,Mitchell. Mitchell.
606,00:41:10.93,00:41:10.93,We have another tie. It seems we're deadlocked.
607,00:41:19.20,00:41:19.20,"In the Survivor rules, in a deadlock, you go to votes cast"
608,00:41:24.00,00:41:24.00,in previous Tribal Councils. The tribe member with the most
609,00:41:29.53,00:41:29.53,votes is the person voted out. How many votes have you had cast
610,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,"against you, Keith? >> KEITH: None."
611,00:41:34.73,00:41:34.73,>> JEFF: Mitchell? >> MITCHELL: One.
612,00:41:36.50,00:41:36.50,>> JEFF: One. One vote is the difference.
613,00:41:39.70,00:41:39.70,I need you to bring me your torch.
614,00:41:41.70,00:41:41.70,">> MITCHELL: Okay. >> JEFF: It's been a long vote,"
615,00:41:55.17,00:41:55.17,Mitchell. The tribe has spoken.
616,00:42:02.93,00:42:02.93,"It's time for you to go. Well, I have a feeling that"
617,00:42:12.13,00:42:12.13,tonight's Tribal Council is going to have a monumental
618,00:42:14.03,00:42:14.03,"effect on this tribe. Grab your torches, head back to"
619,00:42:16.53,00:42:16.53,"camp. >> JEFF: Coming up, scenes from"
620,00:42:31.63,00:42:31.63,our next episode and Mitchell's final words.
621,00:42:36.43,00:42:36.43,Next time on Survivor: Will Ogakor continue their losing
622,00:42:39.00,00:42:39.00,"streak? >> COLBY: Excuses are done,"
623,00:42:42.10,00:42:42.10,check them at the door and let's get down to business.
624,00:42:44.30,00:42:44.30,It is going to be one hell of a show today.
625,00:42:46.07,00:42:46.07,">> JEFF: And at Kucha, the feathers fly."
626,00:42:48.17,00:42:48.17,>> ALICIA: I'm tired of you and the ... chickens!
627,00:42:49.67,00:42:49.67,>> KIMMI: Excuse me? Don't wave your finger in my face!
628,00:42:52.00,00:42:52.00,>> ALICIA: I will always wave my finger at you.
629,00:42:54.10,00:42:54.10,You want me to say it to your face?
630,00:43:01.00,00:43:01.00,>> MITCHELL: That definitely took me by surprise.
631,00:43:03.10,00:43:03.10,"Well, I guess the bright side is, I get to eat, and I need to"
632,00:43:05.77,00:43:05.77,eat. Look at me...
633,00:43:09.57,00:43:09.57,"I feel a little bit betrayed by some of them, but at the same"
634,00:43:13.10,00:43:13.10,"time, I want to shake their hands and congratulate them for"
635,00:43:16.93,00:43:16.93,pulling the wool over my eyes because they definitely got me.
