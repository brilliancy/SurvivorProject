49,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,towards one another.And it makes me feel kind of

82,00:05:35.93,00:05:35.93,is a little bit of a change ofpace.
83,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,"I know it might seem ironic,because I don't eat mammals."

199,00:12:51.90,00:12:51.90,"align with Jerri.And my thought was, if I could"
200,00:12:55.13,00:12:55.13,"get Colby, that would be two ofus."
201,00:12:57.03,00:12:57.03,"And then maybe Colby could talkto Amber, and that would be the"
202,00:13:01.10,00:13:01.10,only chance that I would have tomake it.

219,00:13:50.07,00:13:50.07,the last thing I'm going to dois alienate him.

261,00:15:57.13,00:15:57.13,But to stay in the limelight isgoing to be harder and harder
262,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,because you've got to keep one-upping yourself.

273,00:16:43.97,00:16:43.97,"to think about.And second of all, I want to go"
274,00:16:46.33,00:16:46.33,far with this.After seeing Colby and Keith

276,00:16:53.30,00:16:53.30,"he's trying to convince Colby,but you know what?"
277,00:16:55.87,00:16:55.87,Maybe he's just kind of takingKeith for a ride.
278,00:16:58.57,00:16:58.57,Colby had been talking a lot toKeith.
279,00:17:00.43,00:17:00.43,We know Keith is trying to rearsomething up from behind to try

281,00:17:06.47,00:17:06.47,work is if Keith convinced Tinaand Colby...

287,00:17:19.10,00:17:19.10,>> AMBER: Yep.>> JERRI: This is definitely the
288,00:17:22.57,00:17:22.57,first time I've felt a littlebit threatened.
289,00:17:24.87,00:17:24.87,And I guess I deserve it aftermaking that pompous remark at
290,00:17:27.80,00:17:27.80,Tribal Council.>> AMBER: Colby could be talked
291,00:17:31.57,00:17:31.57,"into things easily.>> JERRI: Yeah, that's what I'm"

295,00:17:41.93,00:17:41.93,the one we're focused on intrying to ensure he's not
296,00:17:44.70,00:17:44.70,changing his mind.Ah...
297,00:17:59.57,00:17:59.57,There he is.Did you find a good spear?

299,00:18:04.63,00:18:04.63,Cool.Colby was pretty excited about
300,00:18:08.23,00:18:08.23,going out hunting for a pig.And I think it's a brilliant
301,00:18:11.80,00:18:11.80,"idea, especially with the firesright now, 'cause a lot of"
302,00:18:15.57,00:18:15.57,wildlife has been flushed thisway.
303,00:18:18.63,00:18:18.63,Fire pretty much stopped.It's always a possibility that
304,00:18:21.80,00:18:21.80,it could jump the river and comeover here.
305,00:18:23.60,00:18:23.60,"I think it's highly unlikelybecause there's no wind,"

318,00:18:54.70,00:18:54.70,definitely separating the gamefrom any relationship with me.
319,00:18:58.57,00:18:58.57,"I think it takes a strong personto do that, quite honestly,"
320,00:19:02.27,00:19:02.27,"especially when there'sobviously, you know, some"

322,00:19:08.43,00:19:08.43,>> COLBY: I don't know.We'll head this way.

324,00:19:13.20,00:19:13.20,Jerri's scared.She's worried that Keith and

340,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53,"so, you know, it just makessense to me... to approach you"
