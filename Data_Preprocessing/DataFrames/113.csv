2,00:00:04.87,00:00:04.87, JEFF PROBST:   36 days ago on this  remote Malaysian island
3,00:00:08.23,00:00:08.23,  16 Americans began   the adventure of a lifetime.
4,00:00:11.57,00:00:11.57,Woo-hoo!
5,00:00:13.30,00:00:13.30, They became castaways
6,00:00:14.97,00:00:14.97,"  leaving behind their jobs,     their loved ones,"
7,00:00:18.10,00:00:18.10, and all contact    with civilization.
8,00:00:20.20,00:00:20.20,"  Their goal: work together   to build a new world,"
9,00:00:24.27,00:00:24.27, but compete against each other    to become the sole survivor
10,00:00:27.77,00:00:27.77,  and win $1 million.
11,00:00:31.27,00:00:31.27,  It was to become  the ultimate human experiment.
12,00:00:35.03,00:00:35.03,  We have to function together   or we fail.
13,00:00:38.07,00:00:38.07,"I'm a redneck, and I don't know corporate world at all,"
14,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53,and corporate world ain't going  to work out here in the bush.
15,00:00:43.60,00:00:43.60," B.B.:  I've been working my ass off, and a lot of you"
16,00:00:45.73,00:00:45.73,"have been laying    on your ass, watching me."
17,00:00:47.33,00:00:47.33,So don't give me any of that ...
18,00:00:48.87,00:00:48.87, RUDY:   The hardest part is
19,00:00:50.40,00:00:50.40, hanging around    with all these young kids.
20,00:00:52.43,00:00:52.43,"   I don't even know    what MTV means, you know?"
21,00:00:54.87,00:00:54.87," JEFF:    At first,  the castaways competed"
22,00:00:57.27,00:00:57.27, as two separate tribes:     Pagong and Tagi.
23,00:01:00.13,00:01:00.13,Survivors ready?
24,00:01:01.10,00:01:01.10,  Go!
25,00:01:08.37,00:01:08.37, JEFF:    Every third night
26,00:01:09.90,00:01:09.90,  the losing tribe would hike   deep into the jungle
27,00:01:12.33,00:01:12.33, to take part in Tribal Council  where they had
28,00:01:15.53,00:01:15.53,  to vote one of their own  off the island.
29,00:01:18.30,00:01:18.30,  Three castaways from Pagong    and three from Tagi
30,00:01:21.43,00:01:21.43, met their untimely fate  in these first 18 days.
31,00:01:24.80,00:01:24.80," On day 21, the tribes merged"
32,00:01:28.20,00:01:28.20, and the competitions    became individual.
33,00:01:30.93,00:01:30.93,  Yes!
34,00:01:32.70,00:01:32.70, As the numbers dwindled
35,00:01:35.57,00:01:35.57, the stakes grew higher   and alliances were promised.
36,00:01:38.37,00:01:38.37,"So, are we going to stick to it?"
37,00:01:40.00,00:01:40.00,I'm going to stick to it.
38,00:01:41.70,00:01:41.70,"   You, me and Gervase could    definitely do something."
39,00:01:43.17,00:01:43.17,"So, let's do it."
40,00:01:45.27,00:01:45.27," So, now it's you and me  to the end, period."
41,00:01:47.57,00:01:47.57," JEFF:   But as strategies deepened,    bonds were broken."
42,00:01:50.60,00:01:50.60, 'Cause I trust her more  than I trust you.
43,00:01:52.20,00:01:52.20,Why? That's bull ...
44,00:01:53.50,00:01:53.50,I've been your friend since day one.
45,00:01:55.57,00:01:55.57," JEFF:  At last week's Tribal Council,    Sean was voted off."
46,00:01:59.27,00:01:59.27," Now, only four remain,    but tonight"
47,00:02:02.20,00:02:02.20, one of these castaways   will make it
48,00:02:05.23,00:02:05.23, through the last three  Tribal Councils
49,00:02:08.33,00:02:08.33, and become the sole survivor.

51,00:03:27.87,00:03:27.87,  RICHARD: Time is kind of out of my head.
52,00:03:30.07,00:03:30.07, I don't have a clock
53,00:03:31.43,00:03:31.43," or a calendar  or a watch or anything,"
54,00:03:33.57,00:03:33.57," but for some reason,   I feel really, really"
55,00:03:36.07,00:03:36.07," comfortable, really good now."
56,00:03:38.23,00:03:38.23," I, um, I think it has   to do with just how short..."
57,00:03:41.73,00:03:41.73,how little time is left.
58,00:03:43.57,00:03:43.57,SUSAN:  We're down to 60 hours.
59,00:03:45.40,00:03:45.40," So, 60 hours,    if you look at it that way,"
60,00:03:48.13,00:03:48.13,"I can deal with it for a chance     to win a million dollars,"
61,00:03:51.23,00:03:51.23, but the hardest thing
62,00:03:52.73,00:03:52.73, for me here now has come down to probably the boredom.
63,00:03:56.77,00:03:56.77,It's peach fuzz.
64,00:03:58.30,00:03:58.30,  Scrape it off.
65,00:04:01.50,00:04:01.50," RUDY:   The girls got razor blades  in their care package,"
66,00:04:06.03,00:04:06.03, so after they got done under their arms
67,00:04:08.13,00:04:08.13,  they shaved my face.
68,00:04:12.50,00:04:12.50,Looks great.
69,00:04:13.57,00:04:13.57,Cool.
70,00:04:14.93,00:04:14.93,   Just like uptown.
71,00:04:15.97,00:04:15.97," Yeah, you look great."
72,00:04:19.63,00:04:19.63," KELLY: Hey, Rudy, clean shaven."
73,00:04:22.57,00:04:22.57,How's it feel?
74,00:04:26.17,00:04:26.17,"  Man, I was dying to   get rid of that thing."
75,00:04:32.93,00:04:32.93," We made about, uh..."
76,00:04:35.60,00:04:35.60,  200 pots of rice  since we've been here.
77,00:04:38.27,00:04:38.27,"  Sometimes we ate    three times a day,"
78,00:04:40.97,00:04:40.97," sometimes twice a day,"
79,00:04:43.37,00:04:43.37, sometimes once a day.
80,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,I'd say I lost 22 pounds  since I've been here.
81,00:04:48.70,00:04:48.70,"How much do we got here, Rudy?"
82,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43,"Like, three-quarters of a bowl each?"
83,00:04:52.60,00:04:52.60, Yeah.
84,00:04:54.10,00:04:54.10,"   It's getting down    to the wire, eh?"
85,00:04:56.20,00:04:56.20, I'm a wreck.
86,00:04:58.53,00:04:58.53, My hair is way longer  than I ever keep it.
87,00:05:00.87,00:05:00.87, This feels like a mop.
88,00:05:02.13,00:05:02.13, There's nothing left.
89,00:05:03.97,00:05:03.97, I used to have  a muscle here growing.
90,00:05:07.27,00:05:07.27,   I think I've lost    a good 30 pounds
91,00:05:10.03,00:05:10.03,"  since getting here, but everything's loose."
92,00:05:13.77,00:05:13.77,  There's nothing that's firm  on this body anymore.
93,00:05:18.40,00:05:18.40,"Basically, I'm a physical wreck."
94,00:05:20.53,00:05:20.53, KELLY:  I'm completely covered  in bug bites from head to toe.
95,00:05:24.83,00:05:24.83, I've lost some weight.
96,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50, I've lost some muscle.
97,00:05:28.33,00:05:28.33, I've lost quite a hunk    of sanity.
98,00:05:32.37,00:05:32.37," Gosh, I don't think I thought"
99,00:05:36.30,00:05:36.30, this was going to be as mental  as it ended up being.
100,00:05:40.80,00:05:40.80,SUSAN:  What's it like   living with somebody
101,00:05:42.83,00:05:42.83,  you don't care for  at the time...
102,00:05:44.33,00:05:44.33, sleeping next to your enemy?
103,00:05:45.90,00:05:45.90, You just do it.
104,00:05:47.47,00:05:47.47,"  You just hang out with them   and eat next to them,"
105,00:05:50.30,00:05:50.30, and just treat them   like a civil person.
106,00:05:52.90,00:05:52.90, That's all you can do.
107,00:05:59.43,00:05:59.43,RUDY:    Of the four of us  that are here right now
108,00:06:02.67,00:06:02.67," we formed this alliance   way in the beginning,"
109,00:06:05.80,00:06:05.80," and, you know, we were  in a position of power"
110,00:06:09.07,00:06:09.07, where we could get rid     of anybody we wanted to--
111,00:06:12.27,00:06:12.27, we had 'em lined up--
112,00:06:14.07,00:06:14.07, but now we're finished    with the alliance
113,00:06:16.73,00:06:16.73,"'cause the four of us are left,  so you're on your own."
114,00:06:20.80,00:06:20.80,  I was really shocked in the beginning
115,00:06:23.10,00:06:23.10,by how few people were planning.
116,00:06:25.60,00:06:25.60,  It seemed a vacation    to 16 people who were told
117,00:06:29.17,00:06:29.17,"  what this was about,"
118,00:06:30.73,00:06:30.73,   who saw the logo that said
119,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47," ""Out wit, Out play, Out last,""  same as I did."
120,00:06:36.80,00:06:36.80,"   In the beginning, nobody wanted the money,"
121,00:06:39.40,00:06:39.40,but now it's all money.
122,00:06:41.40,00:06:41.40,"   You know,    it's on everybody's mind."
123,00:06:43.00,00:06:43.00, And in order to win the money
124,00:06:45.87,00:06:45.87,  you got to make an alliance  or don't even show up.
125,00:06:50.57,00:06:50.57,  RICHARD:    When we got to the point  where the original four
126,00:06:55.40,00:06:55.40," were still here    as the final four,"
127,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,  that alliance had
128,00:06:59.90,00:06:59.90,  gone through a number of machinations
129,00:07:04.13,00:07:04.13, that changed it   from being the original four
130,00:07:08.20,00:07:08.20,  to almost anybody's game.
131,00:07:11.43,00:07:11.43," KELLY:   I feel like I agreed to be  in an alliance,"
132,00:07:14.57,00:07:14.57," and then I didn't want to be  in it anymore,"
133,00:07:17.40,00:07:17.40, but I was too chicken     to tell 'em that.
134,00:07:19.70,00:07:19.70,And I tried to play both sides;
135,00:07:21.50,00:07:21.50,I tried to vote   how I wanted to vote
136,00:07:23.40,00:07:23.40,"  do what I thought was right,    but not let them in on it,"
137,00:07:26.27,00:07:26.27," because, hell, I want  to stay in the game."
138,00:07:29.10,00:07:29.10,"After Gretchen, she didn't vote    in any of the way"
139,00:07:31.13,00:07:31.13,  the alliance voted.
140,00:07:32.07,00:07:32.07,  She was setting herself up
141,00:07:33.53,00:07:33.53, so that if she is the last two    at the end
142,00:07:35.57,00:07:35.57,"  she's going to make herself     look really good,"
143,00:07:37.47,00:07:37.47, 'cause we knew there would be
144,00:07:39.20,00:07:39.20, more Pagong on the jury    than Tagi.
145,00:07:40.83,00:07:40.83, KELLY:  I just bit off
146,00:07:42.03,00:07:42.03,   way more than I could chew
147,00:07:43.57,00:07:43.57,and it just... it all exploded.
148,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67, SUSAN:  What it is is greedy.
149,00:07:47.50,00:07:47.50," She thinks she got...  like, five or six people ago,"
150,00:07:51.20,00:07:51.20,"it's like, you could see  her turn a little bit."
151,00:07:53.63,00:07:53.63, Then I was really irritated.
152,00:07:55.70,00:07:55.70," This has not been easy,     you know,"
153,00:07:57.57,00:07:57.57,  come out here on the island  and get bit up by bugs
154,00:08:00.30,00:08:00.30, and stung by stingrays.
155,00:08:01.50,00:08:01.50, So I told Kelly
156,00:08:02.87,00:08:02.87,  my family's    my number-one goal.
157,00:08:04.37,00:08:04.37, I think I got a better chance  of winning the million dollars
158,00:08:08.03,00:08:08.03, with arrogant Rich by my side     than with her at my side.
159,00:08:11.57,00:08:11.57,   RICHARD:  Had Sue not informed me
160,00:08:14.30,00:08:14.30,"that she had broken the alliance and established one with Kelly,"
161,00:08:18.43,00:08:18.43,  I never would have known it
162,00:08:20.23,00:08:20.23," and the two of them would have  easily undermined me,"
163,00:08:23.53,00:08:23.53, and I could have gone   at any point
164,00:08:25.77,00:08:25.77, if they'd maintained  that alliance.
165,00:08:28.07,00:08:28.07," So it's kind of neat,    cute, nice,"
166,00:08:30.40,00:08:30.40,"  that the final four were     the initial four,"
167,00:08:32.83,00:08:32.83,but it wasn't a continuous line
168,00:08:34.73,00:08:34.73," of ""Ooh, initial four make it   all the way through."""
169,00:08:37.97,00:08:37.97," So there's a different feeling  attached to it,"
170,00:08:40.23,00:08:40.23,  not that sense of accomplishment I would have had
171,00:08:43.43,00:08:43.43, had the trust been unbreached  and we went through cleanly.
172,00:08:52.60,00:08:52.60,"Message, message, message, ooh."
173,00:08:55.70,00:08:55.70," ""'Ode to the fallen comrades':"
174,00:08:57.67,00:08:57.67," ""Here are your targets    from Tribal Councils past."
175,00:09:01.23,00:09:01.23,"  ""Hope you've learned about the people you've sacked."
176,00:09:04.37,00:09:04.37,"  Come to the next challenge   with all your bags packed."""
177,00:09:08.90,00:09:08.90,"Oh! How cool-- like, about their personality."
178,00:09:12.70,00:09:12.70, RUDY:    Somebody will go tonight
179,00:09:14.47,00:09:14.47,  and we're waiting   till after we get back to eat
180,00:09:16.50,00:09:16.50," so we got more food,  'cause one mouth will be gone."
181,00:09:21.30,00:09:21.30, Could be mine;   could be anybody's.
182,00:09:23.80,00:09:23.80, I think maybe  this challenge will be
183,00:09:26.27,00:09:26.27, they'll ask questions    about each person--
184,00:09:29.37,00:09:29.37,"  maybe how old they were,    what they do for a living--"
185,00:09:33.60,00:09:33.60,   which I don't know    and I don't care.
186,00:09:37.50,00:09:37.50,Rudy was just asking what Sean did again.
187,00:09:40.90,00:09:40.90,Rudy won't do very well.
188,00:09:43.93,00:09:43.93,   I think it's going
189,00:09:45.60,00:09:45.60,"to be questions    about, um, these people--"
190,00:09:48.47,00:09:48.47," seeing how well we knew them,"
191,00:09:51.23,00:09:51.23, how well we listened to them.
192,00:09:54.20,00:09:54.20,   I guess things like that.
193,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53, SUSAN:  It's cutthroat time.
194,00:10:13.93,00:10:13.93,"  I would say that Rich, Rudy  and I are getting along well,"
195,00:10:18.77,00:10:18.77," and, uh, Kelly's the one we've been wanting to get out of here."

404,00:21:52.00,00:21:52.00,is going to get a little longer.
405,00:21:53.80,00:21:53.80, Here's how a tiebreaker works.
406,00:21:55.70,00:21:55.70,  Rich and Sue   will not vote.
407,00:21:57.83,00:21:57.83, Kelly and Rudy  will vote again
408,00:22:00.83,00:22:00.83,  but before   we do that
409,00:22:02.90,00:22:02.90,   I want to give each of you    30 seconds
410,00:22:05.20,00:22:05.20,to make a plea for why
411,00:22:07.87,00:22:07.87,   whoever voted for you
412,00:22:09.27,00:22:09.27,   should change    their vote.
413,00:22:10.63,00:22:10.63," So, Rich, I'll  start with you."
414,00:22:12.37,00:22:12.37,Um...
415,00:22:13.90,00:22:13.90,"   Well, Kells Bells,"
416,00:22:16.40,00:22:16.40,somebody's got to go.
417,00:22:20.70,00:22:20.70,"   I'd appreciate your vote, not against me."
418,00:22:23.80,00:22:23.80," Um, I'd love to stay."
419,00:22:25.67,00:22:25.67," I think, uh, it's been   an interesting road,"
420,00:22:29.03,00:22:29.03,"   to say the least,"
421,00:22:30.17,00:22:30.17,as it gets more and more real
422,00:22:31.70,00:22:31.70,"down to these days, like some people may never know."
423,00:22:34.53,00:22:34.53,"We worked well together,"
424,00:22:36.27,00:22:36.27,"and I think, uh, I have a certain responsibility"
425,00:22:39.37,00:22:39.37,for pulling the alliance   together from the beginning.
426,00:22:42.13,00:22:42.13,These are the four we started with
427,00:22:43.90,00:22:43.90,"and, uh, I'd ask for your help."
428,00:22:47.73,00:22:47.73,"Love you, Sue."
429,00:22:49.07,00:22:49.07,"Me, too."
430,00:22:49.07,00:22:49.07,( Rich chuckles )
431,00:22:50.80,00:22:50.80,   JEFF:    Sue?
432,00:22:51.93,00:22:51.93,   Okay.
433,00:22:53.20,00:22:53.20,Rudy...
434,00:22:54.87,00:22:54.87, I'm not going to say anything.
435,00:22:56.70,00:22:56.70,  I'm just leaving it  the way it is.
436,00:22:58.53,00:22:58.53,You know me.
437,00:22:59.90,00:22:59.90,"  You know how I   operate, whatever."
438,00:23:01.90,00:23:01.90,Whatever you want to do.
439,00:23:03.83,00:23:03.83," Rudy,"
440,00:23:05.33,00:23:05.33,  you're up.
441,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,   Take this    with you.
442,00:23:34.03,00:23:34.03,  Same reason.
443,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,"JEFF: Okay, Kelly."
444,00:24:22.73,00:24:22.73,I'm going to go  tally the votes again.
445,00:24:54.97,00:24:54.97,   You guys have been through  a lot.
446,00:24:56.63,00:24:56.63, Let's do this.
447,00:24:58.77,00:24:58.77,  Two votes;
448,00:25:01.37,00:25:01.37,   one of you will be leaving the Tribal Council area.
449,00:25:06.47,00:25:06.47, First vote...
450,00:25:09.40,00:25:09.40,"  ""Sue."""
451,00:25:13.97,00:25:13.97, Second vote...
452,00:25:23.37,00:25:23.37,"  ""Sue."""
453,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,"RICHARD: Thanks, sweetie."
454,00:25:25.73,00:25:25.73," Cool. Hey, no problem."
455,00:25:26.90,00:25:26.90,I'm ready to go.
456,00:25:28.37,00:25:28.37,   You need to bring    me your torch.
457,00:25:31.83,00:25:31.83,   ( Sue laughing ):    You...
458,00:25:33.37,00:25:33.37,Have a smoke and coffee.
459,00:25:35.23,00:25:35.23,   Okay.
460,00:25:38.63,00:25:38.63,   ( chuckling )
461,00:25:39.73,00:25:39.73,Okay. That works.
462,00:25:41.20,00:25:41.20, The tribe  has spoken.
463,00:25:42.73,00:25:42.73,Okay. I'll see you guys later.
464,00:25:46.20,00:25:46.20,  It's time   for you to go.
465,00:25:48.60,00:25:48.60,   Good-bye.
466,00:26:01.83,00:26:01.83,  You guys need to   go get some sleep.
467,00:26:04.17,00:26:04.17,  The last immunity   challenge is tomorrow.
468,00:26:06.57,00:26:06.57,  I'll be waking you up.
469,00:26:07.87,00:26:07.87,I'll see you guys back at camp.
470,00:26:26.77,00:26:26.77,"  SUE:   Oh, I appreciate being able   to talk to everybody"
471,00:26:29.47,00:26:29.47,  for the last time.

473,00:26:32.23,00:26:32.23,"   if I could finish    in the top four or five."""
474,00:26:33.80,00:26:33.80,  I finished top four.
475,00:26:34.83,00:26:34.83,"Hey, that's good enough for me."
476,00:26:36.73,00:26:36.73,"  You know,  outside of the weather"
477,00:26:38.53,00:26:38.53,"  and being cold and rainy     when it rained at night,"
478,00:26:41.13,00:26:41.13,"  and the sand fleas,   this was a lot easier for me"
479,00:26:44.17,00:26:44.17,  than driving a truck through  Chicago every day of the week.
480,00:26:47.53,00:26:47.53, Th-that's a lot worse than being out here in the bush.
481,00:26:51.47,00:26:51.47," JEFF:  Kelly, Rich and Rudy"
482,00:26:53.23,00:26:53.23,  are all that remain   of the Rattana Tribe.
483,00:26:56.03,00:26:56.03, Still to come:     two more Tribal Councils
484,00:26:58.57,00:26:58.57,  and we'll find out  who will be the sole survivor.
485,00:27:30.57,00:27:30.57,Rich? Kelly?
486,00:27:32.80,00:27:32.80," Hey, it's Jeff."
487,00:27:34.70,00:27:34.70,"RICHARD: Oh... yes, so it is."

489,00:27:37.60,00:27:37.60,Let me give you a little morning light here.
490,00:27:39.93,00:27:39.93, Put on something comfortable.
491,00:27:42.47,00:27:42.47,"   Rudy, when you're ready,    come on over and join us."
492,00:27:47.60,00:27:47.60,The end is near.
493,00:27:49.10,00:27:49.10,"  You ready to go, Rudy?"
494,00:27:51.40,00:27:51.40,  Got a long boat ride   ahead of us.
495,00:28:11.80,00:28:11.80,   ( bird screeches )
496,00:28:19.93,00:28:19.93," JEFF:   Today, this moment  really is for you guys."
497,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17, It is the final  rite of passage
498,00:28:25.40,00:28:25.40, of this whole  Survivor experience.
499,00:28:28.00,00:28:28.00,  At the other end     of the sand spit
500,00:28:29.50,00:28:29.50, is the final    immunity challenge.
501,00:28:31.90,00:28:31.90, To get there
502,00:28:33.53,00:28:33.53,  you must first walk through    these palm fronds.
503,00:28:36.53,00:28:36.53,  The natives are chanting
504,00:28:38.47,00:28:38.47,"  ""sandovar""--  spirit is around you."
505,00:28:41.00,00:28:41.00, Then you all must pass    the staffs
506,00:28:43.33,00:28:43.33,  of your fallen comrades.
507,00:28:45.27,00:28:45.27,"  As you go, take a moment    to reflect on them."
508,00:28:48.40,00:28:48.40,  You'll then pass through    the bamboo curtain
509,00:28:51.20,00:28:51.20,  and walk barefoot     across a fire pit
510,00:28:53.27,00:28:53.27," where the embers are burning   at 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit."
511,00:28:56.80,00:28:56.80,"  For 38 days, this island,   sometimes a paradise,"
512,00:29:00.80,00:29:00.80,"  and sometimes a nightmare,"
513,00:29:03.03,00:29:03.03,  has embraced you    as one of its own.
514,00:29:05.67,00:29:05.67,  We have some mud   from the mud volcano.
515,00:29:07.73,00:29:07.73,   But I think it's important   that a little piece
516,00:29:10.83,00:29:10.83,  of the island goes with you   on this experience.
517,00:29:20.17,00:29:20.17, ( chanting ):  Sandovar! Sandovar! Sandovar!
518,00:31:04.30,00:31:04.30, JEFF:  There have been so many steps   along the way
519,00:31:07.37,00:31:07.37,  that you've stepped through    one door into another area.
520,00:31:11.03,00:31:11.03," What we want this to be, right    now, is a way for you guys"
521,00:31:15.07,00:31:15.07, to take everything that you've   become over the last 38 days
522,00:31:19.00,00:31:19.00, and channel it   into one powerful experience.
523,00:31:32.90,00:31:32.90,  This challenge   is very simple
524,00:31:35.23,00:31:35.23,  in its nature   and its execution.
525,00:31:37.20,00:31:37.20,"We're calling it   ""Hands on the Immunity Idol"""
526,00:31:40.27,00:31:40.27,  and the challenge is to simply keep your hand
527,00:31:42.90,00:31:42.90,on that idol as long as you can.
528,00:31:45.60,00:31:45.60,   The last person remaining with a hand on the idol
529,00:31:48.40,00:31:48.40,  wins immunity going   into tonight's vote.
530,00:31:54.80,00:31:54.80, ( screeches )
531,00:31:58.50,00:31:58.50, ( screeches )
532,00:32:00.27,00:32:00.27,"  So, although you can't move   your hands,"
533,00:32:02.67,00:32:02.67,"you can lift your feet,"
534,00:32:04.60,00:32:04.60,just don't let your hand    come off of this.
535,00:32:07.20,00:32:07.20, Good luck to you guys.  Hang in there
536,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,  as long as you can.
537,00:32:10.07,00:32:10.07,The last person standing  gets immunity.
538,00:32:13.77,00:32:13.77,   And we are now beginning.

553,00:32:55.70,00:32:55.70,"Yeah, if I told her to."
554,00:32:59.03,00:32:59.03,"I'd tell her it's a lot    of fun, you know,"
555,00:33:00.73,00:33:00.73,   and she'll do it.

574,00:33:53.60,00:33:53.60,I'd get breakfast first.
575,00:34:13.77,00:34:13.77,Put it right down here.

578,00:34:20.83,00:34:20.83,Take a whiff. Take a whiff.
579,00:34:21.97,00:34:21.97,I thought we could just hold it.
580,00:34:23.67,00:34:23.67,"  No. You know, when   you're finished"
581,00:34:24.87,00:34:24.87,they'll be here for you.

583,00:34:28.50,00:34:28.50,"   Yeah, that'd be nice,    but, uh..."
584,00:34:30.47,00:34:30.47,I keep getting that inspiration from the smell.

586,00:34:35.00,00:34:35.00,   They smell...
587,00:34:35.87,00:34:35.87,I know what oranges smell like.

591,00:34:43.53,00:34:43.53,I don't need to.
592,00:34:44.60,00:34:44.60,You're sure?

596,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,I think it's time for a speech.

598,00:35:11.40,00:35:11.40,I'm thinking I'm probably never

604,00:35:24.57,00:35:24.57,I wish you both luck.
605,00:35:27.60,00:35:27.60, Rich!
606,00:35:28.90,00:35:28.90,"Oh, my gosh!"
607,00:35:31.30,00:35:31.30,  I thought you were   going to make   a long speech?
608,00:35:33.97,00:35:33.97,"Not long. I said, ""a speech."""
609,00:35:37.50,00:35:37.50,"   This game is about    a lot of different things,"
610,00:35:39.80,00:35:39.80,   and one of those things is
611,00:35:41.90,00:35:41.90,"mental strategy, and I thought to myself,"
612,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,"  ""It's doubtful that I would  outlast Kelly"
613,00:35:47.13,00:35:47.13," ""because she just stands there"
614,00:35:48.83,00:35:48.83,"""until the cows come home, period."
615,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,"""And it doesn't mean I'm giving up a million dollars"
616,00:35:53.23,00:35:53.23," necessarily."""
617,00:35:54.30,00:35:54.30,   How come?
618,00:35:55.67,00:35:55.67,   It means that
619,00:35:57.60,00:35:57.60,   whoever is immune   has to pick
620,00:36:00.73,00:36:00.73,between the other two people
621,00:36:03.43,00:36:03.43,  as to who goes to the jury.
622,00:36:06.50,00:36:06.50,"Each of them could, 50-50, pick me."
623,00:36:09.73,00:36:09.73,  I really can't tell.
624,00:36:11.10,00:36:11.10, Even if I am somebody that she'd be better up against
625,00:36:13.37,00:36:13.37,"I don't know that she would do that,"
626,00:36:15.07,00:36:15.07,"and even if Rudy's been loyal the entire time,"
627,00:36:17.47,00:36:17.47,I don't know that he'd continue to be so.
628,00:36:19.67,00:36:19.67,I think so.
629,00:36:20.80,00:36:20.80,"It's all a game of odds, and who knows"
630,00:36:23.40,00:36:23.40,what somebody's  going to actually do.
631,00:36:43.07,00:36:43.07,"Thirsty, Rich?"
632,00:36:44.30,00:36:44.30,"  Oh, thank you, Jeff."
633,00:36:45.77,00:36:45.77,Since you're out of the game.
634,00:36:48.10,00:36:48.10,Appreciate that.
635,00:36:49.40,00:36:49.40,"Lemon, even."
636,00:36:50.33,00:36:50.33,Just for when you guys finish up.
637,00:36:52.60,00:36:52.60,I'll just put 'em over here.
638,00:36:54.60,00:36:54.60," Thanks, Jeff."
639,00:36:55.63,00:36:55.63,With your orange slices.
640,00:36:57.70,00:36:57.70,   Thank you.
641,00:36:58.57,00:36:58.57, Absolutely.
642,00:36:59.67,00:36:59.67,Don't take your hand off the idol.
643,00:37:01.97,00:37:01.97,   But step down off    the logs.
644,00:37:03.20,00:37:03.20,So think about this before you do it.
645,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13,Get a good grip on it.
646,00:37:06.33,00:37:06.33,What you're going to do is rotate positions.
647,00:37:08.67,00:37:08.67,We're going to do that every 30 minutes.
648,00:37:10.50,00:37:10.50,"Rudy, you walk to where Kelly's at"
649,00:37:13.27,00:37:13.27,and vice versa.
650,00:37:14.57,00:37:14.57,"You'll have to reposition, exactly."
651,00:37:33.97,00:37:33.97,   Were you surprised to see  Kelly change her vote?
652,00:37:37.23,00:37:37.23,  It's about what's in   your best interest.
653,00:37:39.37,00:37:39.37,We all four joined an alliance.
654,00:37:39.37,00:37:39.37,Okay.
655,00:37:41.00,00:37:41.00,And Sue and Kelly joined a sub-alliance.
656,00:37:43.40,00:37:43.40,   Against you guys?
657,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,Yeah... to get to the top.
658,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,Okay.
659,00:37:45.57,00:37:45.57,Sue and I had formed an alliance to go...
660,00:37:48.37,00:37:48.37,   Which makes sense.
661,00:37:49.50,00:37:49.50,Suballiances developing.
662,00:37:51.53,00:37:51.53,   But for Sue to flip-flop    again and come tell me...
663,00:37:54.07,00:37:54.07,Right.
664,00:37:54.07,00:37:54.07,Undermines Kelly...
665,00:37:55.33,00:37:55.33,  Right.
666,00:37:56.50,00:37:56.50, Undermines her trust.
667,00:37:59.40,00:37:59.40,I did trust her   earlier in the game
668,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,   and I knew better.
669,00:38:02.53,00:38:02.53," I knew better   not to really trust anybody,"
670,00:38:04.30,00:38:04.30,  and I did and I got burned.
671,00:38:05.77,00:38:05.77,"Me, too."
672,00:38:06.87,00:38:06.87,"So she and I had spoke,"
673,00:38:08.37,00:38:08.37,"  also earlier, about getting    to the final vote,"
674,00:38:10.13,00:38:10.13,"the final three,"
675,00:38:11.53,00:38:11.53,"  and she said, ""Well, I'm not going to let you"
676,00:38:13.07,00:38:13.07,"to get down to the final three."""
677,00:38:14.50,00:38:14.50, And you don't tell me you're not going
678,00:38:16.23,00:38:16.23,   to let me do something   or I can't do something.
679,00:38:16.23,00:38:16.23,Right.
680,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,"And then after I won that immunity after the mask,"
681,00:38:20.80,00:38:20.80,"  she was, ""Hey, are we still this, this, that and the other?"""
682,00:38:24.40,00:38:24.40,"  And I said, ""What's this 'we' ... ?"""
683,00:38:26.60,00:38:26.60,All of a sudden.
684,00:38:27.87,00:38:27.87,"All of sudden, you know,"
685,00:38:29.20,00:38:29.20, I won and she was buddy-buddy  with me again.
686,00:38:31.47,00:38:31.47,  When Sue went behind my back and made an alliance with Kelly
687,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"  I went immediately to Rudy,"
688,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,   'cause there were    only four of us--
689,00:38:37.93,00:38:37.93,Sue and Kelly were in an alliance against me--
690,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17,"I went to Rudy, who I thought I could trust"
691,00:38:42.27,00:38:42.27,"and said, ""Rudy, are you still open to that alliance?"
692,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"  Here's what happened   from the beginning."""
693,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,   I had one with Sue
694,00:38:48.63,00:38:48.63,it's why I couldn't promise you I'd make one with you...
695,00:38:50.03,00:38:50.03,JEFF: Right.
696,00:38:51.13,00:38:51.13,"""You want to make one?"""
697,00:38:52.37,00:38:52.37,And that got you to the final four.
698,00:38:54.17,00:38:54.17,Final two.
699,00:38:55.20,00:38:55.20,With him it was to the final two.
700,00:39:22.57,00:39:22.57, Let me just throw an idea out    that just occurred to me.
701,00:39:25.80,00:39:25.80, When you said earlier
702,00:39:27.33,00:39:27.33,"   that you guys    had the alliance,"
703,00:39:28.80,00:39:28.80,maybe the strongest one.
704,00:39:30.37,00:39:30.37,  Yet you just kind of hopped out of this game
705,00:39:33.43,00:39:33.43,"well over two hours ago,"
706,00:39:33.43,00:39:33.43,Uh-huh.
707,00:39:35.37,00:39:35.37,  leaving Rudy    to carry the ball
708,00:39:37.27,00:39:37.27,"for at least six, seven,  15, 20 hours."
709,00:39:39.93,00:39:39.93, I didn't think  it would go this long.
710,00:39:41.80,00:39:41.80,   You effectively organized   a quit on this one;
711,00:39:44.07,00:39:44.07,"""You know what? I can't do it."
712,00:39:45.77,00:39:45.77,"  ""I'm just gonna say, 'Rudy, you owe me, man."
713,00:39:47.53,00:39:47.53,"I'm going to sit here...'"""
714,00:39:48.73,00:39:48.73,I don't even think he owes me.
715,00:39:50.13,00:39:50.13,But he gave me his word.
716,00:39:51.47,00:39:51.47,   What he does with that--
717,00:39:51.47,00:39:51.47," Well, okay."
718,00:39:52.97,00:39:52.97,   and it's a game--  I'm not going to hate the man
719,00:39:54.50,00:39:54.50," if he changes his mind. But, you know..."
720,00:39:54.50,00:39:54.50, Right.
721,00:39:55.80,00:39:55.80,  Or if he gets tired   in the sun.
722,00:39:56.97,00:39:56.97,Right. Or if he gets tired in the sun.
723,00:39:58.50,00:39:58.50,That's a problem you're in.
724,00:40:00.20,00:40:00.20,"  This really is   your alliance,"
725,00:40:01.77,00:40:01.77,but now it's out of your hands.
726,00:40:03.03,00:40:03.03,It is out of my hands.
727,00:40:04.90,00:40:04.90,I took that chance
728,00:40:05.93,00:40:05.93,"and if I'm third, okay."
729,00:40:07.50,00:40:07.50,   Does it bother you that he's sitting there
730,00:40:09.07,00:40:09.07,and dropped out early?
731,00:40:10.93,00:40:10.93,"  Yeah, I ought to be  sitting there."
732,00:40:19.50,00:40:19.50,  I'm going to force him   to stand up here.
733,00:40:21.47,00:40:21.47,I know.
734,00:40:22.83,00:40:22.83,JEFF: Yeah. He didn't give you that option.
735,00:40:24.83,00:40:24.83,"   Yeah, by him jumping off,   it changes everything again."
736,00:40:29.40,00:40:29.40, Yeah.
737,00:40:30.73,00:40:30.73, 'Cause I was  planning on him  to do this.
738,00:40:33.83,00:40:33.83, To continue this one?
739,00:40:35.77,00:40:35.77,"  Yeah, and I knew I couldn't."
740,00:40:37.93,00:40:37.93,   Swap.
741,00:40:44.10,00:40:44.10,   He took    his hand off.
742,00:40:46.57,00:40:46.57,"   I think that's that, Rudy."
743,00:40:48.20,00:40:48.20,"Well, I'm done."
744,00:40:49.53,00:40:49.53,Nice job.
745,00:40:50.90,00:40:50.90,   Nice job.
746,00:40:51.70,00:40:51.70," Nice job, Rudy."
747,00:40:54.73,00:40:54.73,   Hug time.
748,00:40:55.70,00:40:55.70," Oh, give me  a hug."
749,00:40:57.20,00:40:57.20, There you go.
750,00:40:58.17,00:40:58.17,Five in a row.
751,00:40:59.00,00:40:59.00,That's a record.
752,00:41:14.43,00:41:14.43, KELLY:  I knew a 100%
753,00:41:16.73,00:41:16.73,  the only way that I    was going to get to
754,00:41:18.87,00:41:18.87,"day 38 and now tomorrow, day 39,"
755,00:41:21.80,00:41:21.80,   was with this little thing around my neck.
756,00:41:29.83,00:41:29.83,RICHARD:   The last immunity challenge    was standing there
757,00:41:33.80,00:41:33.80,  attached to a... an idol.
758,00:41:36.93,00:41:36.93, I thought...
759,00:41:38.33,00:41:38.33,ugh... no chance in hell of me doing that
760,00:41:43.83,00:41:43.83,  given who I was up against.
761,00:41:46.40,00:41:46.40, I felt I was forcing the game  to go on unnecessarily.
762,00:41:52.17,00:41:52.17, KELLY:    So Rich just gave     a little speech and said
763,00:41:55.97,00:41:55.97,"  ""I hope you appreciate what I'm doing for the both of you,"""
764,00:41:59.73,00:41:59.73,"  and let go, which I thought   was kind of funny, like..."
765,00:42:03.33,00:42:03.33,"  he was tired, his arm hurt,   he wanted to let go"
766,00:42:06.13,00:42:06.13,   and he was trying to make    some big noble sacrifice
767,00:42:09.17,00:42:09.17,"   for me and Rudy-- yeah, whatever."
768,00:42:11.57,00:42:11.57,RICHARD:  'Cause even if   I'm voted off tonight
769,00:42:13.87,00:42:13.87, I think it's the best decision    I could have made.
770,00:42:18.17,00:42:18.17," KELLY: You know, it's out of my hands."
771,00:42:23.93,00:42:23.93,  So when I won today
772,00:42:26.17,00:42:26.17,"it was just like, ""Okay,"
773,00:42:27.90,00:42:27.90," ""that's it, chill out, relax, breathe... sleep,"
774,00:42:32.67,00:42:32.67,"whatever you got to do."""
775,00:42:34.47,00:42:34.47,Um... so it was    just unbelievable.
776,00:42:38.47,00:42:38.47,"Overwhelming sense of relaxation and, uh, relief."
777,00:42:56.53,00:42:56.53, RUDY:  Dumb.
778,00:42:58.20,00:42:58.20, It was a dumb move on my part.
779,00:43:00.40,00:43:00.40,  I gave away a million bucks.
780,00:43:02.17,00:43:02.17,"I would have won a million bucks if, uh, if I, uh, stayed there,"
781,00:43:06.27,00:43:06.27,  didn't let go of it.
782,00:43:07.90,00:43:07.90, It ain't nobody's fault     but mine.
783,00:43:25.60,00:43:25.60, KELLY:  I'm nervous.
784,00:43:27.00,00:43:27.00, I'm not nervous  about the vote tonight.
785,00:43:29.53,00:43:29.53, I'm extremely nervous  about tomorrow.
786,00:43:32.43,00:43:32.43, I'm nervous about if and what    I'm going to say tomorrow
787,00:43:36.47,00:43:36.47,   and what impact and effect   that's going to have
788,00:43:39.07,00:43:39.07, on the jury.
789,00:43:41.73,00:43:41.73,RICHARD:  I'm hoping that there   is little likelihood
790,00:43:44.23,00:43:44.23," of my being voted off,    but I'm not"
791,00:43:47.60,00:43:47.60,  all that confident.
792,00:43:49.00,00:43:49.00,  I'm not really sure.
793,00:43:50.47,00:43:50.47,I think it's in Kelly's  best interest
794,00:43:53.07,00:43:53.07,"to keep me here,"
795,00:43:54.33,00:43:54.33,but I don't know   that she'll do that.
796,00:43:56.93,00:43:56.93,  I'm hoping she will.
797,00:43:58.37,00:43:58.37," RUDY:   Well, I think me and Kelly"
798,00:44:00.60,00:44:00.60, would fare better...
799,00:44:02.10,00:44:02.10,  I know some people  that would vote for me.
800,00:44:04.23,00:44:04.23,   I don't know of hardly any that are going to vote for Rich.
801,00:44:07.43,00:44:07.43,"  He stepped on some toes,"
802,00:44:09.20,00:44:09.20, and people ain't going  to forgive him.
803,00:44:36.07,00:44:36.07,"JEFF: Hey, Rich."
804,00:44:39.43,00:44:39.43,Kelly.
805,00:44:42.80,00:44:42.80,"Hey, Rudy."
806,00:44:48.07,00:44:48.07,"   Dang, that's hot."
807,00:44:54.47,00:44:54.47,Grab a seat.
808,00:44:57.63,00:44:57.63,We'll bring in our jury.
809,00:45:12.23,00:45:12.23,"   Well, Kelly, you have    a tough decision"
810,00:45:15.33,00:45:15.33,to make tonight.
811,00:45:17.07,00:45:17.07,   Rich and Rudy's votes
812,00:45:19.13,00:45:19.13,   effectively cancel each other out.
813,00:45:20.77,00:45:20.77,  Rich can't vote for himself.
814,00:45:22.33,00:45:22.33, He can't vote for you
815,00:45:23.60,00:45:23.60,  because you   have immunity.
816,00:45:24.77,00:45:24.77,  He has to   vote for Rudy.
817,00:45:25.97,00:45:25.97, Same with Rudy.  Can't vote for you.
818,00:45:27.90,00:45:27.90, Can't vote for himself.  Has to vote for Rich.
819,00:45:30.17,00:45:30.17,   So you guys won't    vote tonight.
820,00:45:31.97,00:45:31.97," Kelly, you're going  to be the only one  casting a vote."
821,00:45:34.30,00:45:34.30, Great.
822,00:45:35.57,00:45:35.57,The good news is you're going to cast the vote.
823,00:45:38.63,00:45:38.63,  So let's just look at a few  of the factors
824,00:45:41.40,00:45:41.40,  that come into play.
825,00:45:42.73,00:45:42.73,"Certainly, from day one, the alliance has been a factor."
826,00:45:46.33,00:45:46.33, Four Pagong members over there
827,00:45:48.40,00:45:48.40,  voted off one by one  because of it.
828,00:45:49.83,00:45:49.83," It's probably a wash, though."
829,00:45:51.87,00:45:51.87, It's a Tagi alliance.
830,00:45:53.13,00:45:53.13, You guys are all Tagi.
831,00:45:54.67,00:45:54.67,"So it really comes down    to relationships,"
832,00:45:57.33,00:45:57.33,"   the friendships you have, the impressions"
833,00:46:00.83,00:46:00.83,  that have been made on other people.
834,00:46:02.40,00:46:02.40,The bottom line is this:
835,00:46:03.67,00:46:03.67,"Tonight, you are the queen of the island."
836,00:46:06.57,00:46:06.57,  You have earned it.
837,00:46:07.67,00:46:07.67,   Five challenges in a row.
838,00:46:09.07,00:46:09.07, That gives you power.
839,00:46:10.37,00:46:10.37,  You can't guarantee
840,00:46:11.70,00:46:11.70,"that you're going to win   the million dollars,"
841,00:46:13.93,00:46:13.93,"you need them for that,"
842,00:46:15.37,00:46:15.37, but you can guarantee   one thing--
843,00:46:17.20,00:46:17.20,   that one of these two guys will not get a million dollars.
844,00:46:20.43,00:46:20.43,  You're going to go up there
845,00:46:22.03,00:46:22.03,   and you're going to write    four letters down.
846,00:46:23.63,00:46:23.63,"It's going to be ""Rich""   or it's going to be ""Rudy."""
847,00:46:25.73,00:46:25.73,"   In effect, you're saying, ""You're not getting the money."""
848,00:46:28.50,00:46:28.50, You ready to do this?
849,00:46:29.67,00:46:29.67, Let's cast your vote.
850,00:47:06.20,00:47:06.20, You know the drill.
851,00:47:07.57,00:47:07.57,  One of you will be
852,00:47:08.87,00:47:08.87,  leaving Tribal   Council area.
853,00:47:12.70,00:47:12.70,There's one vote.
854,00:47:21.60,00:47:21.60,The 14th person voted off the island...
855,00:47:27.13,00:47:27.13,is Rudy.
856,00:47:29.23,00:47:29.23,   You need to bring    me your torch.
857,00:47:36.80,00:47:36.80,I don't blame her.
858,00:47:40.37,00:47:40.37,"   In this case,    Kelly has spoken."
859,00:47:49.67,00:47:49.67,  It's time   for you to go.
860,00:47:51.77,00:47:51.77,   That way?
861,00:47:52.80,00:47:52.80,   Yeah.
862,00:47:53.83,00:47:53.83, Good night.
863,00:48:10.90,00:48:10.90,So here's how it will work tomorrow.
864,00:48:14.47,00:48:14.47,Each member of the jury will get one question.
865,00:48:17.97,00:48:17.97," You guys will get to respond,"
866,00:48:20.50,00:48:20.50,  and then you'll get   a chance at the end
867,00:48:23.57,00:48:23.57,  to sort of state your case.
868,00:48:25.93,00:48:25.93,   Now the tables are turned.
869,00:48:28.07,00:48:28.07, The power's out  of your hands.
870,00:48:29.93,00:48:29.93,It's up to them.
871,00:48:31.83,00:48:31.83,"   Hope you can get    a good night's sleep,"
872,00:48:34.40,00:48:34.40,  and I'll see   you guys tomorrow.
873,00:48:37.03,00:48:37.03, Good night.
874,00:48:56.87,00:48:56.87, RUDY:  I never thought     I'd come this far
875,00:48:59.27,00:48:59.27," and I got three votes,  then I got two votes,"
876,00:49:02.23,00:49:02.23,  then I got one vote
877,00:49:04.17,00:49:04.17," and then they forgot about me,"
878,00:49:05.80,00:49:05.80," and I figured,     ""I'm right in the middle"
879,00:49:07.60,00:49:07.60,"  where I want to be now."""
880,00:49:09.40,00:49:09.40, And I didn't get a...
881,00:49:11.10,00:49:11.10, today's the first time  I got a vote since...
882,00:49:13.70,00:49:13.70,  a month ago.
883,00:49:16.37,00:49:16.37,   And it was the fatal vote.
884,00:49:18.40,00:49:18.40,  ( chuckles )
885,00:49:19.63,00:49:19.63, JEFF:    Only two remain.
886,00:49:21.50,00:49:21.50, Stay tuned to find out  who will be the sole survivor.
887,00:49:43.77,00:49:43.77, KELLY:  Woke up and it was very weird.
888,00:49:46.83,00:49:46.83,"  Richard said to me,    ""Okay, you're not dreaming."
889,00:49:49.23,00:49:49.23,"  It's the last day   and it's really just us two."""
890,00:49:53.07,00:49:53.07,"  It's nice to, to chill out."
891,00:49:56.10,00:49:56.10,"  I mean, tonight's   going to be a big deal"
892,00:49:57.87,00:49:57.87,  and it's going   to be crazy.
893,00:50:00.80,00:50:00.80,Yeah.
894,00:50:02.63,00:50:02.63,   I think I'm going   to go visit my tree.
895,00:50:04.13,00:50:04.13,Okay.
896,00:50:05.27,00:50:05.27,  For a little while.
897,00:50:06.13,00:50:06.13,Have fun.
898,00:50:07.20,00:50:07.20,I will.
899,00:50:08.13,00:50:08.13,Say good-bye.
900,00:50:09.47,00:50:09.47,  I know. That's what I'm going to do.
901,00:50:18.20,00:50:18.20, This is just    where I like to be.
902,00:50:20.73,00:50:20.73, This is where I prefer
903,00:50:22.53,00:50:22.53,  to stretch and chill out     and do my thing.
904,00:50:25.33,00:50:25.33,  My last little yoga session    here on the beach.
905,00:50:28.83,00:50:28.83, It's something that I've done   pretty much every day
906,00:50:31.90,00:50:31.90, since I've been here.
907,00:50:33.20,00:50:33.20, It helps me to relax
908,00:50:35.73,00:50:35.73,  and to quiet my thoughts.
909,00:50:37.77,00:50:37.77,I've had a lot of moral issues.
910,00:50:40.83,00:50:40.83,  I regret being part     of the alliance.
911,00:50:42.47,00:50:42.47,  That didn't make me   feel so good.
912,00:50:44.07,00:50:44.07,"  I regret... trusting Sue,"
913,00:50:48.07,00:50:48.07,  being vulnerable to her.
914,00:50:50.17,00:50:50.17,  That really hurt me     in a lot of ways.
915,00:50:57.67,00:50:57.67,"RICHARD:    It's kind of nice    to be one of the last two,"
916,00:51:00.27,00:51:00.27,  and it's nice to have Kelly   as the other member.
917,00:51:02.83,00:51:02.83,"  I think I'm, uh, reflecting"
918,00:51:04.57,00:51:04.57,a little bit on what's happened     for the 39 days.
919,00:51:07.13,00:51:07.13,  I think I'm also thinking   a little bit about questions
920,00:51:10.23,00:51:10.23,"  that will be asked   by the jury tonight,"
921,00:51:12.23,00:51:12.23,  and how to approach     some potential questions.
922,00:51:15.13,00:51:15.13," It's an interesting morning,"
923,00:51:17.30,00:51:17.30, and I intend to stay     completely out of the sun
924,00:51:19.97,00:51:19.97, and try and do nothing.
925,00:51:34.93,00:51:34.93," KELLY:  But it's been  really hard, mentally."
926,00:51:37.87,00:51:37.87,Just...
927,00:51:40.60,00:51:40.60,  people trying to...
928,00:51:47.93,00:51:47.93,  My brain is just...
929,00:51:49.90,00:51:49.90," I can't think about anything,    really, right now."
930,00:52:02.40,00:52:02.40,"Burn, baby, burn."
931,00:52:10.00,00:52:10.00, The end of the spoons.
932,00:52:14.27,00:52:14.27,"  Fire, fire."
933,00:52:17.97,00:52:17.97, KELLY:  There's been some...     moral low points
934,00:52:21.07,00:52:21.07, for me in playing this game.
935,00:52:22.93,00:52:22.93," I've had some, kind of,   not-so-proud moments,"
936,00:52:25.53,00:52:25.53," and, uh, that's things"
937,00:52:26.70,00:52:26.70, that I'm leaving here
938,00:52:28.57,00:52:28.57,"on this island,   and with this game,"
939,00:52:31.47,00:52:31.47,"   and, uh, that don't belong    in, uh... my life."
940,00:52:35.47,00:52:35.47,   Burning the flag.
941,00:52:38.97,00:52:38.97,RICHARD:   I think it might have been    cathartic for Kelly
942,00:52:42.33,00:52:42.33,"  to pack things up, organize,"
943,00:52:43.90,00:52:43.90,  and burn some of the stuff   we just don't need anymore.
944,00:52:49.13,00:52:49.13,Boards.
945,00:52:52.33,00:52:52.33,   I'll stay out    of the fire.
946,00:52:53.70,00:52:53.70, You just...
947,00:52:56.20,00:52:56.20,"Good-bye, camp."
948,00:52:58.80,00:52:58.80, Burn.
949,00:53:00.20,00:53:00.20,"RICHARD: Burn, camp, burn."
950,00:53:13.13,00:53:13.13, W-what will you miss the most?
951,00:53:17.67,00:53:17.67,What will I miss the most?
952,00:53:19.67,00:53:19.67,"Just kind of looking at sunsets,"
953,00:53:22.30,00:53:22.30,or watching the stars or things like that.
954,00:53:24.80,00:53:24.80,"Those quiet moments, just recognizing where I am"
955,00:53:27.67,00:53:27.67,in the middle of the South China Sea
956,00:53:29.83,00:53:29.83,on this...
957,00:53:31.50,00:53:31.50,"   uninhabited, rain forest, tropical island, and..."
958,00:53:37.20,00:53:37.20, KELLY: I just want to get through today
959,00:53:39.50,00:53:39.50,and get through    the firing squad tonight.
960,00:53:41.83,00:53:41.83,I don't think any of these people
961,00:53:43.93,00:53:43.93,  are vindictive or anything.
962,00:53:46.10,00:53:46.10,  I think it might just be...   really fun.
963,00:54:03.43,00:54:03.43, KELLY:  I'm really grateful I'm here.
964,00:54:06.53,00:54:06.53,  Um... I feel lucky to be     in the... the final two.
965,00:54:10.93,00:54:10.93,  I'm nervous    about the decision tonight
966,00:54:13.73,00:54:13.73, because Rich never pretended
967,00:54:16.13,00:54:16.13,"  that he wasn't in it to win,"
968,00:54:18.17,00:54:18.17," and he never pretended  that he wasn't, um..."
969,00:54:21.47,00:54:21.47," scheming and conniving,     and all of that,"
970,00:54:23.40,00:54:23.40,  from the beginning.
971,00:54:25.33,00:54:25.33,  He's playing the game  and he's never acted  like he wasn't.
972,00:54:28.33,00:54:28.33, So I-I do respect that.
973,00:54:30.23,00:54:30.23,"  Okay, can we uh..."
974,00:54:31.60,00:54:31.60,Let's get our stash.
975,00:54:33.27,00:54:33.27,"Turn off the lights, and, uh..."
976,00:54:34.53,00:54:34.53,Turn off the lights.
977,00:54:35.80,00:54:35.80,make sure the oven's off and everything.
978,00:54:37.87,00:54:37.87,RICHARD:  If I get second place    I will not be sad.
979,00:54:40.57,00:54:40.57," I will be happy that   I've earned a hundred grand,"
980,00:54:43.83,00:54:43.83,"  and had a great time here,"
981,00:54:45.60,00:54:45.60,"  and played a game that I'm  proud of, the way I played it,"
982,00:54:49.50,00:54:49.50,but I want the million.
983,00:54:52.00,00:54:52.00,   I really want the million.
984,00:54:53.60,00:54:53.60,"  Oh, my God, it would change my life."
985,00:55:29.40,00:55:29.40," SEAN:   The question: ""Does the end    justify the means?"""
986,00:55:33.53,00:55:33.53,"  Apparently,  these two contestants"
987,00:55:35.73,00:55:35.73,"  did whatever it took    to get to the end,"
988,00:55:37.93,00:55:37.93," but, you know, it's not    the end of the contest yet,"
989,00:55:40.33,00:55:40.33," in my opinion, because  they haven't suffered"
990,00:55:42.43,00:55:42.43, all the ramifications   of getting there yet.
991,00:55:44.60,00:55:44.60,GERVASE:  Kelly's an all-around   nice person.
992,00:55:46.83,00:55:46.83,  I think she just  did what she had to do
993,00:55:49.07,00:55:49.07,   to get to the spot    of the final two.
994,00:55:50.80,00:55:50.80, She stayed low under the radar.
995,00:55:52.40,00:55:52.40, You never really heard
996,00:55:53.90,00:55:53.90," too much about Kelly,   but when it came down to it,"
997,00:55:56.90,00:55:56.90,  ended up winning    five challenges at the end.
998,00:55:59.60,00:55:59.60,   I'm really quite impressed
999,00:56:00.93,00:56:00.93,  with the way   she played the game.
1000,00:56:24.33,00:56:24.33, RUDY:    I liked Rich all the way    through this thing.
1001,00:56:27.73,00:56:27.73,  He's a good leader.
1002,00:56:29.33,00:56:29.33,"  He's smart, and he's the guy"
1003,00:56:31.37,00:56:31.37," that got this alliance going,"
1004,00:56:33.90,00:56:33.90, which brought   the four of us right
1005,00:56:36.53,00:56:36.53," to the final stage, and that's    what we were really after."
1006,00:56:42.60,00:56:42.60,"   It was interesting to watch Kelly,"
1007,00:56:44.10,00:56:44.10,"'cause I felt like Kelly went through, like, uh,"
1008,00:56:46.40,00:56:46.40,"identity crisises on TV, but not really crisises,"
1009,00:56:48.97,00:56:48.97,   but like various    identities on TV.
1010,00:56:50.53,00:56:50.53," ""I'm a hippie,  but I'm not a hippie."""
1011,00:56:52.13,00:56:52.13," ""I'm a double agent,   but I'm not lying."""
1012,00:56:54.03,00:56:54.03,"  ""I'm here for the money,   but I'm not."""
1013,00:56:56.80,00:56:56.80,"You know, it was interesting to watch her, uh..."
1014,00:56:59.87,00:56:59.87,  watch the various identities unfold.
1015,00:57:22.07,00:57:22.07,"COLLEEN:   This is a really difficult   vote because, I mean,"
1016,00:57:26.93,00:57:26.93,"   does anybody really think,    you know,"
1017,00:57:29.53,00:57:29.53,"  ""Go, Kelly.    She's number one."""
1018,00:57:31.63,00:57:31.63,"   ""I am so happy she made it    to the final two,"""
1019,00:57:34.60,00:57:34.60,"or, ""God, I'm glad Rich made it there. Big winner""? No."
1020,00:57:38.60,00:57:38.60,"  But I think we just want   to end it, you know?"
1021,00:57:41.27,00:57:41.27, Let's go home.
1022,00:57:43.80,00:57:43.80,"I'm actually very happy  I got out when I did,"
1023,00:57:46.27,00:57:46.27,"   thank God, because  I couldn't have been ruthless."
1024,00:57:48.93,00:57:48.93,  People would  see right through me.
1025,00:57:50.80,00:57:50.80,   I can't even lie.
1026,00:57:52.33,00:57:52.33," I can live with myself, and that's the important thing."
1027,00:58:09.07,00:58:09.07,"  Tonight, actually,   I'm looking forward"
1028,00:58:11.40,00:58:11.40,"   to being able to come in,  because I'm a hunter."
1029,00:58:14.33,00:58:14.33, I got both guns loaded   all the way
1030,00:58:17.20,00:58:17.20,   and I'm going to fire 'em
1031,00:58:18.77,00:58:18.77,"  full-blast,   and I will walk away on top,"
1032,00:58:22.17,00:58:22.17,"  holding my values,  true to myself."
1033,00:58:25.00,00:58:25.00," Oh, yeah. I can't wait to get up there tonight."
1034,00:58:34.00,00:58:34.00,( gong ringing )
1035,00:58:42.93,00:58:42.93,We'll bring in our final   Tribal Council jury.
1036,00:58:54.73,00:58:54.73,"  Tonight, these seven    former tribe mates"
1037,00:58:58.47,00:58:58.47, will decide your fate.
1038,00:59:00.53,00:59:00.53,Here's what's at stake:
1039,00:59:02.63,00:59:02.63,"   One of you will be awarded $100,000"
1040,00:59:06.57,00:59:06.57, for your 39 days here.
1041,00:59:08.60,00:59:08.60,  The other...
1042,00:59:09.93,00:59:09.93,will be awarded with...   a new Pontiac Aztec
1043,00:59:14.37,00:59:14.37, and $1 million  to do with whatever you want.
1044,00:59:19.17,00:59:19.17,"   39 days ago, all you guys   came here with probably only"
1045,00:59:23.77,00:59:23.77,"the vaguest idea  of what you were getting into,"
1046,00:59:27.10,00:59:27.10,and I just want   to congratulate all of you.
1047,00:59:30.17,00:59:30.17,You all made it    to the final core of nine.
1048,00:59:32.77,00:59:32.77,"You endured harsh island living,"
1049,00:59:36.80,00:59:36.80," lack of food,   very unpredictable weather,"
1050,00:59:39.40,00:59:39.40,"   sometimes very, very hot,  and sometimes very, very wet."
1051,00:59:43.03,00:59:43.03," You created a new civilization and you lived within it,"
1052,00:59:46.77,00:59:46.77,  and you all played the game   very well--
1053,00:59:48.87,00:59:48.87,a game that definitely parallels  our own regular lives in ways
1054,00:59:53.60,00:59:53.60,that we probably never imagined.
1055,00:59:55.50,00:59:55.50, Extremely complicated.
1056,00:59:57.13,00:59:57.13,"   If we were voting tonight   for the... sweetest person,"
1057,01:00:00.70,01:00:00.70,   you can make a strong case
1058,01:00:02.57,01:00:02.57," for Sonja maybe, or Gretchen."
1059,01:00:05.67,01:00:05.67,"  If it was the most athletic,   maybe Gervase, Joel."
1060,01:00:08.97,01:00:08.97,"  Certainly if it was the best outdoors person, probably Greg."
1061,01:00:13.10,01:00:13.10,   So we could go around here   and find positive attributes
1062,01:00:16.53,01:00:16.53,"  for why everybody is worthy,   but the fact remains"
1063,01:00:19.07,01:00:19.07, Rich and Kelly    are the two sitting here.
1064,01:00:21.90,01:00:21.90,"   Clearly, these two played the game the best"
1065,01:00:24.73,01:00:24.73,"  and that's what we came here to do, play this game, Survivor."
1066,01:00:29.20,01:00:29.20, So let's begin    the final Tribal Council.
1067,01:00:32.60,01:00:32.60,We'll start with opening remarks  from Rich and Kelly--
1068,01:00:38.17,01:00:38.17,a chance for you    to state your case
1069,01:00:40.40,01:00:40.40,"as to why you're   still sitting here tonight,"
1070,01:00:43.50,01:00:43.50,  and why you deserve    to be the final survivor.
1071,01:00:46.73,01:00:46.73,"  We'll start with you, Kelly."
1072,01:00:48.20,01:00:48.20,  Um... I'm not a politician.
1073,01:00:51.27,01:00:51.27,   I didn't come here
1074,01:00:53.13,01:00:53.13,to campaign for myself.
1075,01:00:56.00,01:00:56.00, I think we're all adults here.
1076,01:00:58.07,01:00:58.07,"   I think we all know that,    you know, this is a game,"
1077,01:01:00.97,01:01:00.97,"and, uh, I hope nobody has taken   anything personally."
1078,01:01:03.70,01:01:03.70,"I haven't, uh... or I don't know"
1079,01:01:05.97,01:01:05.97,   that I necessarily haven't     taken anything personally.
1080,01:01:08.90,01:01:08.90,"   I've tried not to,"
1081,01:01:10.27,01:01:10.27,  or I hope we're not going to be judged here
1082,01:01:13.33,01:01:13.33,on how we chose    to play the game.
1083,01:01:16.00,01:01:16.00,"I'm hoping what   we're going to be judged on,"
1084,01:01:18.17,01:01:18.17,"or I, personally, will be judged    on is the person that I am"
1085,01:01:23.23,01:01:23.23," and the conversations that we had, the time we spent together,"
1086,01:01:25.97,01:01:25.97,"  the things we talked about,"
1087,01:01:28.17,01:01:28.17,"you know, with, with, that game"
1088,01:01:29.53,01:01:29.53,we played the other night--
1089,01:01:30.93,01:01:30.93,how well did you get to know people--
1090,01:01:32.67,01:01:32.67,"um, things like that..."
1091,01:01:34.00,01:01:34.00, I didn't have the conversations I had with you
1092,01:01:36.90,01:01:36.90,  an-and want to know   the things about you
1093,01:01:39.00,01:01:39.00,"  and share my life with you,"
1094,01:01:40.63,01:01:40.63, because I thought I was going   to be quizzed on it
1095,01:01:43.23,01:01:43.23, or because it was part    of some strategy.
1096,01:01:45.23,01:01:45.23,"   Um, it was because    we were all here together"
1097,01:01:47.13,01:01:47.13,and I cared to know all of you.
1098,01:01:48.77,01:01:48.77,"  I don't know. Maybe, as Jeff said, if we were voting"
1099,01:01:51.57,01:01:51.57, for the sweetest or the nicest
1100,01:01:53.33,01:01:53.33,"or things like that,"
1101,01:01:54.50,01:01:54.50,"um, maybe neither of us would be up here."
1102,01:01:56.70,01:01:56.70,I don't know that the best person
1103,01:01:59.53,01:01:59.53,"is sitting up here,"
1104,01:02:01.30,01:02:01.30," but, uh, hopefully, you know,   the better person will win."
1105,01:02:06.13,01:02:06.13,Richard.
1106,01:02:08.37,01:02:08.37,  I take a little bit  of a different approach to it.
1107,01:02:10.80,01:02:10.80,"   For me, it's    not about you"
1108,01:02:12.37,01:02:12.37,deciding who the best person is.
1109,01:02:14.83,01:02:14.83,I-I don't think you really know who I am
1110,01:02:17.77,01:02:17.77,and probably don't know  who Kelly is.
1111,01:02:20.43,01:02:20.43,My approach to the game
1112,01:02:21.90,01:02:21.90,  was one of strategy   from the beginning.
1113,01:02:23.37,01:02:23.37,"Before I even got here,    I started to think"
1114,01:02:25.73,01:02:25.73,about what it might take
1115,01:02:27.97,01:02:27.97,"  to get through 14 ejections,  and it got really complicated."
1116,01:02:33.50,01:02:33.50, And I couldn't really plan it   as well as I thought
1117,01:02:36.63,01:02:36.63,and it certainly didn't turn out
1118,01:02:39.27,01:02:39.27,"  to, uh, uh,  go according to plan,"
1119,01:02:41.53,01:02:41.53,"but I certainly had a strategy,"
1120,01:02:44.13,01:02:44.13,"  and I came to play a game,   and I was playing a game."
1121,01:02:47.83,01:02:47.83,"There were a lot of sincere interactions,"
1122,01:02:50.57,01:02:50.57," but no matter  how sincere they were,"
1123,01:02:52.70,01:02:52.70, I don't think   anybody really knows
1124,01:02:54.60,01:02:54.60,  who we are in only 39 days.
1125,01:02:57.83,01:02:57.83,   I think the starts  of friendships
1126,01:02:59.60,01:02:59.60," are certainly    things that have happened,"
1127,01:03:02.27,01:03:02.27,"   but, uh... for me,"
1128,01:03:03.77,01:03:03.77,   instead of who's    the better person
1129,01:03:05.33,01:03:05.33,"  it is about   who played the game better,"
1130,01:03:07.17,01:03:07.17,and I'm hoping you just respect
1131,01:03:09.77,01:03:09.77, my having approached the game  from that perspective
1132,01:03:13.87,01:03:13.87,"  from early, early, early on."
1133,01:03:17.33,01:03:17.33,"All right, jury,   now it's your turn."
1134,01:03:19.80,01:03:19.80," Take a moment,  collect your thoughts,"
1135,01:03:22.47,01:03:22.47, then you'll each have  an opportunity
1136,01:03:25.27,01:03:25.27,to address both Rich and Kelly.
1137,01:03:39.73,01:03:39.73,"All right, jury,"
1138,01:03:42.20,01:03:42.20,   it's your turn now    to address Rich and Kelly.
1139,01:03:43.83,01:03:43.83,   Each of you will be given an opportunity to ask a question
1140,01:03:46.80,01:03:46.80,   or make a comment.
1141,01:03:48.00,01:03:48.00," Gervase, we'll start with you."
1142,01:03:52.37,01:03:52.37,   ( clears throat )
1143,01:03:53.50,01:03:53.50," Kelly and Rich,"
1144,01:03:54.70,01:03:54.70,how's it going?
1145,01:03:56.13,01:03:56.13, I just wanted to know is there
1146,01:03:58.33,01:03:58.33,"any one, two or three things you would change"
1147,01:04:01.53,01:04:01.53,"  from your 39 days   on this island, or   nothing at all?"
1148,01:04:04.40,01:04:04.40,   JEFF:    Rich?
1149,01:04:05.60,01:04:05.60,"   Hmm, good question. Um..."
1150,01:04:10.33,01:04:10.33,"Well, I got too comfortable"
1151,01:04:14.00,01:04:14.00,"believing that I could trust what was said,"
1152,01:04:17.30,01:04:17.30,and was really surprised to learn
1153,01:04:19.17,01:04:19.17,"that I couldn't, at one point,"
1154,01:04:20.93,01:04:20.93, and that was something that shocked me.
1155,01:04:22.80,01:04:22.80," I thought, ""Ooh, damn. I need  to stay on my toes even more,"""
1156,01:04:25.63,01:04:25.63,  because I'd been surprised.
1157,01:04:27.30,01:04:27.30,Kelly?
1158,01:04:30.30,01:04:30.30, The one thing I probably would change
1159,01:04:32.23,01:04:32.23,"is I probably wouldn't have, um,    joined an alliance, uh..."
1160,01:04:34.70,01:04:34.70,"when I did, um, just because"
1161,01:04:38.53,01:04:38.53,"of the emotional and moral issues that I had,"
1162,01:04:44.23,01:04:44.23,"and, uh, certainly some votes"
1163,01:04:46.47,01:04:46.47,that I cast strategically
1164,01:04:48.17,01:04:48.17,  for myself--
1165,01:04:49.67,01:04:49.67,"alliance, no alliance-- it was about, you know,"
1166,01:04:51.80,01:04:51.80,"playing the game and that was hard,"
1167,01:04:54.37,01:04:54.37,"voting off competition,"
1168,01:04:55.87,01:04:55.87,"voting off people I liked, people I enjoyed."
1169,01:04:58.47,01:04:58.47,"  Um, that's about it."
1170,01:05:00.20,01:05:00.20,"Great. Thanks, Gervase."
1171,01:05:02.57,01:05:02.57,Jenna.
1172,01:05:06.07,01:05:06.07,"Kelly, Rich,"
1173,01:05:07.97,01:05:07.97,   you guys have a remarkable  opportunity tonight--
1174,01:05:11.00,01:05:11.00,   a 50-50 chance at getting    a million dollars.
1175,01:05:13.67,01:05:13.67,"Yeah, that's a big deal,"
1176,01:05:15.40,01:05:15.40,and so I want to know
1177,01:05:17.30,01:05:17.30,   if you could take    and put two people
1178,01:05:18.73,01:05:18.73," in your place  in lieu of yourselves,"
1179,01:05:20.37,01:05:20.37,who would it be and why?
1180,01:05:22.00,01:05:22.00,"  Wild question:   ""Who would it   be and why?"""
1181,01:05:24.80,01:05:24.80,"   Okay, Rudy would be here,"
1182,01:05:26.57,01:05:26.57,because it's a game
1183,01:05:28.63,01:05:28.63,"and because he and I made an alliance very early,"
1184,01:05:33.53,01:05:33.53," and, uh, I really appreciated    his integrity and loyalty,"
1185,01:05:36.83,01:05:36.83,"even in the midst of this game,"
1186,01:05:39.00,01:05:39.00,so I would put him here because I thought
1187,01:05:42.13,01:05:42.13,"he played very, very well."
1188,01:05:44.67,01:05:44.67,"  Wow, another person    I would put here."
1189,01:05:49.20,01:05:49.20,   I might have to say Greg.
1190,01:05:51.20,01:05:51.20,He and I didn't get a chance to really get to know each other.
1191,01:05:54.07,01:05:54.07,"I think he's pretty guarded,"
1192,01:05:55.80,01:05:55.80,"  but, uh, we did take a walk  and I was trying to figure out"
1193,01:05:58.33,01:05:58.33,"who he was, and I thought"
1194,01:06:00.20,01:06:00.20,"he was certainly, uh, my biggest competition,"
1195,01:06:02.53,01:06:02.53,  so I thought  he was probably trying
1196,01:06:04.57,01:06:04.57,"to plan something,"
1197,01:06:06.47,01:06:06.47,"but, uh, I never did get"
1198,01:06:08.60,01:06:08.60,"  to find out   whether he was or not, so..."
1199,01:06:12.20,01:06:12.20," Um, if I could pick two people"
1200,01:06:14.23,01:06:14.23,  I would probably pick Sonja  and Gretchen.
1201,01:06:16.33,01:06:16.33,"Uh, I really admire those women."
1202,01:06:18.67,01:06:18.67,"   Um, I felt   that they were very strong,"
1203,01:06:22.30,01:06:22.30,very smart and very honest.
1204,01:06:24.70,01:06:24.70,"Maybe we have kind of a different approach to things, but, uh..."
1205,01:06:27.67,01:06:27.67,I really admired their character
1206,01:06:29.53,01:06:29.53,and I would like   to see them up here.
1207,01:06:31.17,01:06:31.17,"Thanks, Jenna."
1208,01:06:33.00,01:06:33.00,Sean.
1209,01:06:37.03,01:06:37.03," Hey, guys,  congratulations  on being here."
1210,01:06:39.77,01:06:39.77,  I don't have   any questions.
1211,01:06:41.97,01:06:41.97,I spent 36 days with you  on that beach
1212,01:06:43.77,01:06:43.77,"  and, damn it, there's a lot   of things I want to forget"
1213,01:06:46.00,01:06:46.00, rather than ask you  questions about.
1214,01:06:47.53,01:06:47.53, I just have a  few things to say--
1215,01:06:50.53,01:06:50.53,   nothing disparaging--    about both of you.
1216,01:06:53.13,01:06:53.13,"   Kelly, thank you very    much for being as    capable as you are."
1217,01:06:55.87,01:06:55.87, You and Sue  single-handedly
1218,01:06:57.63,01:06:57.63,kept that camp afloat.
1219,01:07:00.30,01:07:00.30,"  And, um..."
1220,01:07:01.63,01:07:01.63,"Richard, dear Richard..."
1221,01:07:03.27,01:07:03.27,"also, likewise, enjoyed your company thoroughly."
1222,01:07:05.83,01:07:05.83," You played the game  differently than I did,"
1223,01:07:08.23,01:07:08.23,"  and it was contentious   between us at times,"
1224,01:07:10.33,01:07:10.33,"   and, uh, you're there"
1225,01:07:11.27,01:07:11.27,"and I'm over here, so go figure"
1226,01:07:13.27,01:07:13.27," what I know, but, uh,   either way,"
1227,01:07:14.57,01:07:14.57,congratulations on being there.
1228,01:07:16.47,01:07:16.47,   Thank you for    teaching me    a little bit
1229,01:07:18.03,01:07:18.03,"   about myself, uh,    while I've been here."
1230,01:07:19.33,01:07:19.33,I think you've been very honest
1231,01:07:21.27,01:07:21.27,and constructive in any criticism you have given me.
1232,01:07:24.50,01:07:24.50,"  Your ""F.N.F"" idea--"
1233,01:07:26.50,01:07:26.50,"   the ""fat, naked fag"" idea    is extraordinarily funny"
1234,01:07:28.93,01:07:28.93,"  and a fat, naked fag  with a million dollars"
1235,01:07:31.30,01:07:31.30,"   is even funnier,    so I haven't made    up my mind yet"
1236,01:07:33.10,01:07:33.10," but when I get back  there, I'm going to  think about it,"
1237,01:07:35.33,01:07:35.33,"  and, uh, we'll see   which way it goes."
1238,01:07:36.50,01:07:36.50,"All right, guys, congratulations."
1239,01:07:40.07,01:07:40.07,Colleen.
1240,01:07:41.70,01:07:41.70,"   God, he was nice."
1241,01:07:45.77,01:07:45.77,"  All right, here we go."
1242,01:07:47.63,01:07:47.63,"No, I'm kidding."
1243,01:07:49.07,01:07:49.07,"Um, actually, I have just a question"
1244,01:07:52.13,01:07:52.13,  for myself and for   future players   of this game:
1245,01:07:54.83,01:07:54.83,What three character traits do you think got you where you are
1246,01:07:57.60,01:07:57.60,  and you think are essential   and really important
1247,01:07:59.57,01:07:59.57, to be where you are  at this point?
1248,01:08:01.60,01:08:01.60,"JEFF: Kelly, start with you."
1249,01:08:04.30,01:08:04.30,"   I would have to say, uh..."
1250,01:08:07.20,01:08:07.20," faith was one,    uh, because a week"
1251,01:08:10.80,01:08:10.80,"or however long ago,"
1252,01:08:12.30,01:08:12.30,I was pretty certain that I was out of the game.
1253,01:08:15.27,01:08:15.27,"   I had said before,  the only thing"
1254,01:08:17.13,01:08:17.13,"   that kept me in this game    up to this point,"
1255,01:08:19.03,01:08:19.03,"  I honestly believe, is that stupid necklace."
1256,01:08:21.00,01:08:21.00,"Um, but, uh, I knew I wanted to get this far"
1257,01:08:24.57,01:08:24.57,and I think faith really helped me.
1258,01:08:27.53,01:08:27.53,Probably a strong will.
1259,01:08:29.83,01:08:29.83,There was a lot of... of ugliness mentally
1260,01:08:33.23,01:08:33.23,"and trying to figure out  who you are and, uh, you know,"
1261,01:08:37.07,01:08:37.07,  what you like about yourself
1262,01:08:39.30,01:08:39.30,"and the people around you,"
1263,01:08:42.43,01:08:42.43,"and, uh, I don't know,"
1264,01:08:44.10,01:08:44.10,"and maybe just a tinge of likability, I hope."
1265,01:08:46.83,01:08:46.83,"Um, three things"
1266,01:08:48.90,01:08:48.90, I can think of
1267,01:08:50.97,01:08:50.97,"are, uh, self-awareness,    uh, observation..."
1268,01:08:55.07,01:08:55.07,  Observation?
1269,01:08:55.93,01:08:55.93,And-and...
1270,01:08:57.37,01:08:57.37,Your game the other day was funny.
1271,01:09:00.20,01:09:00.20,"You say ""observation."""
1272,01:09:00.20,01:09:00.20,Uh-huh.
1273,01:09:02.17,01:09:02.17,"Like, of observing other people."
1274,01:09:02.17,01:09:02.17,Yeah.
1275,01:09:04.70,01:09:04.70, But then you didn't do so good    in the game the other day.
1276,01:09:07.47,01:09:07.47,"  True, it's a different   kind of observation."
1277,01:09:09.27,01:09:09.27,It's-it's...
1278,01:09:10.67,01:09:10.67,"   When I say self-awareness,"
1279,01:09:12.33,01:09:12.33," first of all,   I think it requires"
1280,01:09:14.23,01:09:14.23,that I understand myself enough    to be comfortable
1281,01:09:16.63,01:09:16.63,with playing the game the way I felt I had to play it to do well.
1282,01:09:20.57,01:09:20.57,"   Then when it comes to observation,"
1283,01:09:22.30,01:09:22.30,  it's about observing  relationships more than it is
1284,01:09:25.23,01:09:25.23, about learning who people are  to become friends with them.
1285,01:09:28.60,01:09:28.60,Nothing against becoming friends with people-- I'd love to.
1286,01:09:31.67,01:09:31.67,"There are many people here I'd love to interact with, but I wasn't doing that."
1287,01:09:35.30,01:09:35.30,"That wasn't my focus, and that showed, obviously."
1288,01:09:37.83,01:09:37.83,"I was observing what people were doing, who could be trusted;"
1289,01:09:41.10,01:09:41.10," who was planning or plotting,   who wasn't;"
1290,01:09:43.60,01:09:43.60," who was playing the game well, who was trying to play the game;"
1291,01:09:47.07,01:09:47.07,who was having fun.
1292,01:09:48.30,01:09:48.30,I wasn't judging what they were doing.
1293,01:09:49.97,01:09:49.97,I was just trying
1294,01:09:51.57,01:09:51.57, to observe as carefully  as I could to determine
1295,01:09:54.73,01:09:54.73,   what people were here for    and what they were doing.
1296,01:09:57.63,01:09:57.63,"And then I said ethics, because I think"
1297,01:10:00.30,01:10:00.30, I played as ethically as is humanly possible.
1298,01:10:03.27,01:10:03.27,I think I-I played cleanly
1299,01:10:05.43,01:10:05.43,"and, uh, I think it's a really important piece,"
1300,01:10:08.90,01:10:08.90,because if you undermine  your credibility along the way
1301,01:10:12.37,01:10:12.37,you stand less of a chance here
1302,01:10:14.97,01:10:14.97,when you face the people  that you'd worked with
1303,01:10:18.33,01:10:18.33,to get where you are.
1304,01:10:20.83,01:10:20.83,Rudy.
1305,01:10:25.70,01:10:25.70,  I don't have nothing to say  to these two.
1306,01:10:28.13,01:10:28.13, I'd just like    to let everybody here know
1307,01:10:30.13,01:10:30.13,how dumb I feel
1308,01:10:32.00,01:10:32.00,after the mistake I made yesterday.
1309,01:10:35.63,01:10:35.63,Okay.
1310,01:10:37.87,01:10:37.87,Greg.
1311,01:10:39.37,01:10:39.37,Yeah.
1312,01:10:43.43,01:10:43.43, Rich.
1313,01:10:44.77,01:10:44.77, Greg.
1314,01:10:46.53,01:10:46.53,Choose a number   between one and ten.
1315,01:10:48.13,01:10:48.13, Seven.
1316,01:10:49.33,01:10:49.33," Okay. Kelly, a number"
1317,01:10:51.93,01:10:51.93,between one and ten.
1318,01:10:51.93,01:10:51.93,Three.
1319,01:10:56.10,01:10:56.10,Character is character.
1320,01:10:57.63,01:10:57.63,Sue.
1321,01:11:00.63,01:11:00.63,"Um, I have no questions."
1322,01:11:03.13,01:11:03.13,I just have statements.
1323,01:11:05.53,01:11:05.53," Rich, you are"
1324,01:11:08.67,01:11:08.67," a very openly arrogant,  pompous human being,"
1325,01:11:13.90,01:11:13.90,  but I admire your   frankness with it.
1326,01:11:16.37,01:11:16.37,  You have worked hard   to get where you're at
1327,01:11:18.57,01:11:18.57,and you started working hard
1328,01:11:20.50,01:11:20.50,way before you come to the island.
1329,01:11:22.67,01:11:22.67,So with my work ethic background
1330,01:11:25.03,01:11:25.03,"  I give that   credit to you,"
1331,01:11:28.03,01:11:28.03,"  but on the other hand,   your inability"
1332,01:11:30.97,01:11:30.97, to admit your failures
1333,01:11:33.00,01:11:33.00,without going into a whiny speech
1334,01:11:35.97,01:11:35.97, makes you a bit  of a loser in life.
1335,01:11:40.77,01:11:40.77,Kelly...
1336,01:11:44.03,01:11:44.03,the rafting persona queen...
1337,01:11:47.20,01:11:47.20, you did get stomped on  on national TV
1338,01:11:50.00,01:11:50.00," by a city boy that never swam,"
1339,01:11:51.83,01:11:51.83,let alone been in the woods or a jungle
1340,01:11:54.10,01:11:54.10,or rowed a boat in his life.
1341,01:11:58.10,01:11:58.10,You sucked on that game.
1342,01:11:59.83,01:11:59.83,"  Anyways, I was your friend   at the beginning of this,"
1343,01:12:04.87,01:12:04.87, really thinking that  you were a true friend.
1344,01:12:07.57,01:12:07.57, I was willing to be  sitting there and  put you next to me.
1345,01:12:11.43,01:12:11.43," At that time,    you were sweeter than me."
1346,01:12:13.37,01:12:13.37,I'm not    a very openly nice person.
1347,01:12:15.67,01:12:15.67,"   I'm just frank,    forward and tell    you it the way it is."
1348,01:12:19.73,01:12:19.73," To have you sit there next to me, and me lose $900,000"
1349,01:12:24.83,01:12:24.83,   just to stomp on    somebody like this...
1350,01:12:27.33,01:12:27.33,but as the game went along and the two tribes merged
1351,01:12:31.33,01:12:31.33,"you lied to me, which showed me"
1352,01:12:34.53,01:12:34.53,what the true person that you are.
1353,01:12:36.47,01:12:36.47,You're very two-faced
1354,01:12:38.07,01:12:38.07, and manipulative to get where  you were at anywhere in life.
1355,01:12:41.93,01:12:41.93, That's why you fail  all the time.
1356,01:12:44.60,01:12:44.60,  Hmm... interesting.
1357,01:12:46.83,01:12:46.83,"   So, at that    point of the game"
1358,01:12:49.30,01:12:49.30, I decided then just to go out  with my alliance to my family
1359,01:12:52.93,01:12:52.93,"  and just to hold my dignity   and values in check,"
1360,01:12:56.07,01:12:56.07,"   and hoping    I hadn't lost    too many of them,"
1361,01:12:58.37,01:12:58.37," and, uh, play the game just as long as possible"
1362,01:13:02.00,01:13:02.00,"and hang in there as long as possible,"
1363,01:13:04.07,01:13:04.07," but, Kelly,"
1364,01:13:05.37,01:13:05.37,go back to a couple of times Jeff said to you
1365,01:13:09.17,01:13:09.17,"   ""What goes around    comes around."""
1366,01:13:12.00,01:13:12.00,  It's here.
1367,01:13:15.40,01:13:15.40,   You will not get my vote.
1368,01:13:16.67,01:13:16.67,"  My vote will go to Richard,"
1369,01:13:18.00,01:13:18.00, and I hope that  is the one vote
1370,01:13:21.03,01:13:21.03, that makes you  lose the money.
1371,01:13:23.97,01:13:23.97,"If it's not, so be it."
1372,01:13:25.90,01:13:25.90,I'll shake your hand
1373,01:13:28.40,01:13:28.40,"   and I'll go on from here,"
1374,01:13:30.43,01:13:30.43,  but if I were ever pass you   along in life again
1375,01:13:33.67,01:13:33.67,"   and you were laying there dying of thirst,"
1376,01:13:36.53,01:13:36.53,I would not give you a drink of water.
1377,01:13:38.50,01:13:38.50,I would let the vultures take you
1378,01:13:43.13,01:13:43.13,"   and do whatever they want  with you, with no ill regrets."
1379,01:13:47.50,01:13:47.50,  I plead to the jury tonight
1380,01:13:50.03,01:13:50.03,  to think a little bit about the island that we have been on.
1381,01:13:54.17,01:13:54.17,  This island is pretty much   full of only two things:
1382,01:13:58.23,01:13:58.23,snakes and rats.
1383,01:14:02.83,01:14:02.83,And in the end of Mother Nature
1384,01:14:05.27,01:14:05.27,"we have Richard the snake, who knowingly went after prey,"
1385,01:14:09.47,01:14:09.47," and Kelly, who  turned into the rat"
1386,01:14:11.47,01:14:11.47,"that ran around like the rats do on this island,"
1387,01:14:14.43,01:14:14.43, trying to run  from the snake.
1388,01:14:16.40,01:14:16.40,I feel we owe it to the island's spirits
1389,01:14:18.93,01:14:18.93,"  that we have learned to come to know,"
1390,01:14:21.23,01:14:21.23,"   to let it be, in the end,"
1391,01:14:23.17,01:14:23.17, the way Mother Nature   intended it to be--
1392,01:14:25.80,01:14:25.80, for the snake  to eat the rat.
1393,01:14:42.20,01:14:42.20," JEFF:  Okay, Rich and Kelly,"
1394,01:14:43.70,01:14:43.70,  we'll now offer you  an opportunity
1395,01:14:45.57,01:14:45.57,   for closing remarks    if you have something
1396,01:14:47.50,01:14:47.50,  different to offer
1397,01:14:48.53,01:14:48.53,"from your opening remarks,"
1398,01:14:50.33,01:14:50.33,   based on what you've heard  from the jury.
1399,01:14:53.30,01:14:53.30,"  Kelly, I'll start with you."
1400,01:14:55.27,01:14:55.27,"  Um... Sue, I'm sorry    you feel that way."
1401,01:14:59.60,01:14:59.60,"Uh, to the rest of you,"
1402,01:15:02.23,01:15:02.23,"um, I can sit up here"
1403,01:15:03.80,01:15:03.80,"and, uh, probably turn the tables"
1404,01:15:06.23,01:15:06.23,"on Sue and, uh, tell you many number of lies"
1405,01:15:08.80,01:15:08.80,and backstabbing things
1406,01:15:10.27,01:15:10.27,  that she has done to myself
1407,01:15:12.27,01:15:12.27,"and, uh, this person sitting next to me."
1408,01:15:15.03,01:15:15.03, I don't think anybody   in this game
1409,01:15:16.97,01:15:16.97,"is without, um, faults or errors"
1410,01:15:19.50,01:15:19.50,"or, um, unproud moments  of themselves."
1411,01:15:23.53,01:15:23.53,"Uh, so I already... I know how she stands on things."
1412,01:15:26.40,01:15:26.40,"So to the rest of you,"
1413,01:15:28.20,01:15:28.20,"um, I hope you vote how you feel,"
1414,01:15:31.00,01:15:31.00,"um, not because of what Sue says"
1415,01:15:32.83,01:15:32.83,"  or the things that happened    between she and I,"
1416,01:15:35.10,01:15:35.10,because that was between    she and I.
1417,01:15:36.70,01:15:36.70,That doesn't involve anybody else.
1418,01:15:39.03,01:15:39.03,"So, um..."
1419,01:15:42.43,01:15:42.43,  It's in your hands.
1420,01:15:44.70,01:15:44.70, Rich?
1421,01:15:47.13,01:15:47.13,"  Um, I imagine it's probably"
1422,01:15:48.67,01:15:48.67,"  a pretty difficult decision for some people,"
1423,01:15:50.93,01:15:50.93, and I just want to say
1424,01:15:52.23,01:15:52.23," that I appreciate, uh, your making it."
1425,01:15:54.17,01:15:54.17,"I, uh, wouldn't change anything that I did,"
1426,01:15:58.17,01:15:58.17,  and I hope you respect that
1427,01:15:59.97,01:15:59.97,  that was what I felt I needed to do to play the game.
1428,01:16:03.37,01:16:03.37,Thanks.
1429,01:16:05.70,01:16:05.70,   JEFF:    Okay.
1430,01:16:07.57,01:16:07.57,   A little reminder   of what's at stake:
1431,01:16:09.63,01:16:09.63,  One of these people
1432,01:16:10.70,01:16:10.70," will be awarded  $100,000."
1433,01:16:12.60,01:16:12.60,  The other person--
1434,01:16:14.43,01:16:14.43,  something very   different.
1435,01:16:16.93,01:16:16.93, A new Pontiac Aztec...
1436,01:16:19.63,01:16:19.63,  and a treasure chest   full of $1 million.
1437,01:16:23.50,01:16:23.50,"  Normally at Tribal Council, we vote against someone."
1438,01:16:27.33,01:16:27.33,We vote somebody off the island.
1439,01:16:29.63,01:16:29.63,We've done it 14 times.
1440,01:16:31.43,01:16:31.43, Tonight you will vote  for someone.
1441,01:16:33.77,01:16:33.77,You will vote for who you think   is most worthy; the winner;
1442,01:16:37.93,01:16:37.93,the person who played this game    the best.
1443,01:16:39.90,01:16:39.90," However you want to define it,"
1444,01:16:41.70,01:16:41.70, you are casting a vote  for who's going to leave here
1445,01:16:44.57,01:16:44.57, with the money    and the title of survivor.
1446,01:16:46.57,01:16:46.57," Gervase, we'll start with you."
1447,01:17:12.30,01:17:12.30," My vote is for Kelly,  because I feel"
1448,01:17:15.97,01:17:15.97, Kelly played this game    better than anybody else.
1449,01:17:19.33,01:17:19.33,"   She came into this thing,"
1450,01:17:21.07,01:17:21.07,"she formed her alliance, played both sides of the fence,"
1451,01:17:24.77,01:17:24.77,"  did her lying thing,    but you know what?"
1452,01:17:27.50,01:17:27.50,"   When it comes down to it,  it's all good."
1453,01:17:29.80,01:17:29.80, That's what this game is about
1454,01:17:31.77,01:17:31.77, and she did it    better than anybody else.
1455,01:17:33.97,01:17:33.97," She stayed low under the radar and just did her thing,"
1456,01:17:37.23,01:17:37.23,  and I think she really deserves this
1457,01:17:39.17,01:17:39.17,  more than anybody else here.
1458,01:17:40.80,01:17:40.80, And just one of Sue's comments
1459,01:17:43.87,01:17:43.87,"that's what, in my town, we call a ""sore loser,"""
1460,01:17:47.57,01:17:47.57,"   because when Sue was doing   the backstabbing, the lying,"
1461,01:17:50.50,01:17:50.50,"the throwing the knives    everywhere, she was happy."
1462,01:17:53.37,01:17:53.37,"   If she was sitting    in Kelly's spot right now,"
1463,01:17:55.13,01:17:55.13, she wouldn't be thinking about nothing but this million dollars
1464,01:17:57.93,01:17:57.93, and that's it.
1465,01:17:59.83,01:17:59.83, So that just goes to show you    how trite she is.
1466,01:18:02.30,01:18:02.30," I mean, it disgusts me    what she just did."
1467,01:18:04.20,01:18:04.20,It was so foul.
1468,01:18:05.83,01:18:05.83,"   You know,    Sue put knives in my back."
1469,01:18:07.60,01:18:07.60," Sue, she talks about a rat and a snake?"
1470,01:18:09.57,01:18:09.57," Well, Sue, uh,   formed an alliance,"
1471,01:18:11.37,01:18:11.37,"so that's her little snake part,  and then she did the rat part"
1472,01:18:14.40,01:18:14.40,   where she lied to Colleen   in her face
1473,01:18:16.10,01:18:16.10, when Colleen asked her  if she voted for her.
1474,01:18:18.40,01:18:18.40,"  So, I mean,    that just goes to show you"
1475,01:18:20.30,01:18:20.30,   how people play this game    when it comes down to it.
1476,01:18:22.67,01:18:22.67,   If it's saving their butt
1477,01:18:24.07,01:18:24.07,  they'll do anything   to save their butt.
1478,01:18:25.93,01:18:25.93," When they're out of the game,    they cry about it."
1479,01:18:28.27,01:18:28.27,They bellyache about it the whole stinking time
1480,01:18:30.53,01:18:30.53,and that makes me sick.
1481,01:18:32.13,01:18:32.13," So, Kelly, I hope you win it,"
1482,01:18:34.53,01:18:34.53," and after you win it, you can stuff it in Sue's face."
1483,01:18:48.47,01:18:48.47,  I am choosing Kelly.
1484,01:18:52.20,01:18:52.20,I think Kelly displayed   a lot of the aspects
1485,01:18:55.37,01:18:55.37,  that I think are a survivor.
1486,01:18:57.70,01:18:57.70,"   She befriended me,"
1487,01:18:59.37,01:18:59.37,"   and whether that was part   of a friendship or strategy,"
1488,01:19:03.63,01:19:03.63, it was all a part of the game.
1489,01:19:06.23,01:19:06.23,"Uh, she played it well."
1490,01:19:07.90,01:19:07.90,She proves that   by sitting up there.
1491,01:19:10.20,01:19:10.20,"  She endured not only the physical but the emotional,"
1492,01:19:13.60,01:19:13.60,especially after the last speech.
1493,01:19:15.53,01:19:15.53,I felt for her.
1494,01:19:16.80,01:19:16.80, I think she is a good person.
1495,01:19:18.83,01:19:18.83,  I think if she lied   and she manipulated
1496,01:19:21.17,01:19:21.17,  it-it was in the spirit of the game.
1497,01:19:23.20,01:19:23.20,"  But as far as Kelly,"
1498,01:19:24.73,01:19:24.73,  I still get the vibe    that she's a great person.
1499,01:19:26.97,01:19:26.97," And she certainly did survive    along with the rest of us,"
1500,01:19:29.77,01:19:29.77,"and she made it, uh, very clear   in the last five challenges"
1501,01:19:32.87,01:19:32.87,that she could do this.
1502,01:19:34.37,01:19:34.37,"  Uh, and she endured the rain and the hunger,"
1503,01:19:36.77,01:19:36.77,"as well, if not better,   than the rest of us."
1504,01:19:39.27,01:19:39.27,"So, uh, I think    she is a survivor,"
1505,01:19:40.87,01:19:40.87,  and I think she deserves the  title and the million dollars.
1506,01:19:51.47,01:19:51.47," Okay, guys, it's been   a long time coming."
1507,01:19:54.53,01:19:54.53,   It's been a long contest.
1508,01:19:56.50,01:19:56.50, The general sentiment in the jury box is that
1509,01:19:59.97,01:19:59.97,  this contest has degenerated  from a contest
1510,01:20:03.20,01:20:03.20,  of who's the most deserving  into a contest
1511,01:20:06.13,01:20:06.13, of who's least objectionable.
1512,01:20:07.87,01:20:07.87, I feel that way very strongly.
1513,01:20:09.90,01:20:09.90, You both conducted yourselves  in different manners than me--
1514,01:20:13.43,01:20:13.43,the way I would have wanted to--
1515,01:20:15.40,01:20:15.40," um, and you put the whole jury  in a real difficult position."
1516,01:20:19.17,01:20:19.17,"   Um, I don't think either of you truly deserve it,"
1517,01:20:22.00,01:20:22.00,but I am voting for Rich
1518,01:20:23.63,01:20:23.63,"   because Kelly was clearly more deceptive,"
1519,01:20:25.97,01:20:25.97," more manipulative, um,  more double-faced than Richard"
1520,01:20:29.53,01:20:29.53,   who's just    an out-and-out scoundrel.
1521,01:20:31.57,01:20:31.57,"  But I like him, uh, in some bizarre manner,"
1522,01:20:34.10,01:20:34.10,"  and I think that his fat, naked fag idea is fantastic"
1523,01:20:37.13,01:20:37.13,"  and a fat, naked fag"
1524,01:20:38.60,01:20:38.60, with a million dollars    is just hilarious.
1525,01:20:49.60,01:20:49.60,  ( sputtering lips )
1526,01:21:05.60,01:21:05.60,  ( chuckles )
1527,01:21:06.87,01:21:06.87," This is awful, really."
1528,01:21:08.53,01:21:08.53,  This whole... you know what?
1529,01:21:10.70,01:21:10.70,"I mean, take it,  and do what you want with it."
1530,01:21:14.20,01:21:14.20, I don't care.
1531,01:21:16.10,01:21:16.10, What got me tonight--  I'm changing my vote.
1532,01:21:18.83,01:21:18.83,   I came here voting  for the other person--
1533,01:21:21.10,01:21:21.10,"  What got me tonight was that   you said ""will"" is required"
1534,01:21:25.87,01:21:25.87," in this game,  and that's something you had."
1535,01:21:29.47,01:21:29.47," And, uh, even though you were  kind of wishy-washy and stuff,"
1536,01:21:34.80,01:21:34.80,"you know, you wanted it    really, really bad"
1537,01:21:38.27,01:21:38.27,   and Rich doesn't need it.
1538,01:21:40.77,01:21:40.77,"   So, buy a raft and start    an adventure tour company"
1539,01:21:45.10,01:21:45.10, and do something good with it
1540,01:21:48.03,01:21:48.03,  and maybe this will make you  be nice or something.
1541,01:21:52.43,01:21:52.43,"   Okay, that's all."
1542,01:22:05.10,01:22:05.10,"  As I stated, Rich, I admire your strong work ethic."
1543,01:22:10.87,01:22:10.87,  You started a long time ago   to get here
1544,01:22:14.93,01:22:14.93,   and you're honest  about why you're here.
1545,01:22:18.93,01:22:18.93,"  So, you can have it."
1546,01:22:37.30,01:22:37.30," We had an alliance to the end,"
1547,01:22:39.23,01:22:39.23,   and I'm fulfilling  my obligation.
1548,01:23:11.97,01:23:11.97," Okay, breathe."
1549,01:23:13.27,01:23:13.27,   ( exhales deeply )
1550,01:23:20.67,01:23:20.67," JEFF:   Well, this has been"
1551,01:23:22.40,01:23:22.40, an amazing experience.
1552,01:23:24.13,01:23:24.13,  I can't wait to see    how it turns out.
1553,01:23:26.37,01:23:26.37,I'll go tally the votes.
1554,01:24:03.03,01:24:03.03,   16 of you were...
1555,01:24:06.27,01:24:06.27,brave enough to be marooned here    in Borneo.
1556,01:24:09.70,01:24:09.70,  There will be one survivor.
1557,01:24:14.20,01:24:14.20,  I'll read the votes.
1558,01:24:21.03,01:24:21.03, First vote...
1559,01:24:26.77,01:24:26.77," ""Rich."""
1560,01:24:34.20,01:24:34.20,"""Kelly."""
1561,01:24:48.40,01:24:48.40," ""Rich."""

1563,01:25:06.53,01:25:06.53,"""Rich."""
1564,01:25:18.50,01:25:18.50,"""Kelly."""
1565,01:25:24.97,01:25:24.97,"That's three votes Rich,    three votes Kelly."
1566,01:25:27.37,01:25:27.37,I need water and oxygen.
1567,01:25:37.63,01:25:37.63,The winner of the first   Survivor competition is...
1568,01:25:43.13,01:25:43.13," ""Rich."""
1569,01:25:45.53,01:25:45.53,"Congratulations, Rich."
1570,01:25:47.27,01:25:47.27,  ( applause )
1571,01:25:52.40,01:25:52.40,Congratulations.
