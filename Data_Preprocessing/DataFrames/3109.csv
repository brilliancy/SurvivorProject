248,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,THIS IS A BAD ONE.
249,00:12:26.57,00:12:26.57,LAST NIGHT WAS BAD.
250,00:12:27.87,00:12:27.87,SAVAGE WENT HOME.

270,00:13:18.10,00:13:18.10,>> THERE IS DEFINITELY STRATEGY GOING INTO REWARD.
271,00:13:20.67,00:13:20.67,IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE MORE ALONE TIME WITH A DIFFERENT GROUP OF
272,00:13:23.60,00:13:23.60,PEOPLE THAT MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T GET IN CAMP.
273,00:13:29.00,00:13:29.00,>> ARE WE TALKING STRATEGY AT ALL OR ARE WE TALKING FOOD ONLY?
274,00:13:34.53,00:13:34.53,"BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I'M CLEARLY ON THE OUTS, SO IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN"

278,00:13:45.87,00:13:45.87,YOU NEED TO USE EVERY ONE OF THOSE VOTES STRATEGICALLY.
279,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,AND ABI AND CIERA ARE WORKING HARDER THAN THE DOMINANT
280,00:13:53.13,00:13:53.13,"ALLIANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE DESPERATE, SO THOSE ARE THE ONES"
281,00:13:55.53,00:13:55.53,WHO DESERVE TO BE HERE.

287,00:14:10.70,00:14:10.70,EVERYONE WANTS TO FLIP IT ON ITS HEAD.
288,00:14:12.53,00:14:12.53,SO TO PLAY THIS OLD SCHOOL GAME WHERE WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE OF
289,00:14:16.00,00:14:16.00,FIVE AND THAT FIVE HAS A FOUR WITHIN IT AND A THREE WITHIN IT
290,00:14:18.83,00:14:18.83,"AND A TWO WITHIN IT, IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HOLD."
291,00:14:21.37,00:14:21.37,IT'S GOING TO GETDY DISFLED.
292,00:14:22.67,00:14:22.67,>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WIGGLES?
293,00:14:25.20,00:14:25.20,>> SHE HAS THE FIRST SEASON.
294,00:14:28.00,00:14:28.00,SHE'S BEEN VERY SMART.
295,00:14:29.77,00:14:29.77,>> YES.
296,00:14:30.47,00:14:30.47,">> HER SOCIAL ABILITY, SHE TALKS TO EVERYONE."
297,00:14:32.80,00:14:32.80,">> YEAH, THAT'S TRUE."
298,00:14:33.73,00:14:33.73,>> NO ONE DISLIKES WIGGLES.
299,00:14:35.90,00:14:35.90,">> I THINK THERE'S VOTING BLOCS THAT MAKE SENSE, AND THE NEXT"
300,00:14:42.53,00:14:42.53,DAY THAT COULD BE COMPLETELY OUT THE WINDOW.
301,00:14:44.47,00:14:44.47,I THINK THIS IS MOVING MUCH FASTER AND VERY DIFFERENT THAN
302,00:14:48.57,00:14:48.57,THE GAME HAS EVER IN THE PAST.
303,00:14:57.47,00:14:57.47,>> OKAY.
304,00:15:02.10,00:15:02.10,SO WE'LL SAVE TWO BIG CLAMS FOR TOMORROW.
305,00:15:05.07,00:15:05.07,">> I'M PISSED OFF THIS WE LOST, AND NOT THAT WE JUST LOST BUT WE"
306,00:15:10.50,00:15:10.50,LOST BY SO MUCH.
307,00:15:11.37,00:15:11.37,WE GOT CRUSHED.
308,00:15:12.33,00:15:12.33,"BUT WITH ONLY FIVE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY'RE COOKING AND TALKING AND"
309,00:15:14.53,00:15:14.53,EVERYTHING.
310,00:15:15.17,00:15:15.17,"THEY'RE GOING TO LET ME GO AND LEAVE ME ALONE, AND I WENT AND"
311,00:15:18.63,00:15:18.63,LOOKED FOR THE IDOL.
312,00:15:22.67,00:15:22.67,I WANTED TO CHECK TREE MAIL.
313,00:15:24.30,00:15:24.30,"AN I'M DIGGING AROUND TREE MAIL AND EVERYTHING, AND NOTHING"
314,00:15:26.40,00:15:26.40,AROUND THERE.
315,00:15:27.70,00:15:27.70,"AND THE FIRST IDOL I GOT WAS IN A TREE UNDER LEAVES, SO I WAS"
316,00:15:33.73,00:15:33.73,"LIKE, THERE'S A HUGE TREE AT TREE MAIL."
317,00:15:43.13,00:15:43.13,"OH, MY GOD."
318,00:15:44.13,00:15:44.13,"OH, MY GOD."
319,00:15:45.37,00:15:45.37,"WHEN I TURNED AROUND, LIKE IT WAS JUST STARING AT ME."
320,00:15:55.80,00:15:55.80,THIS IS SO CRAZY.
321,00:15:58.87,00:15:58.87,"NOT AGAIN, MAN."
322,00:16:00.43,00:16:00.43,NOT A FREAKING AGAIN.
323,00:16:07.90,00:16:07.90,I'VE GOT TO BE INCONSPICUOUS.
324,00:16:09.73,00:16:09.73,"TONIGHT AFTER EVERYONE ELSE LIES DOWN TO GO TO SLEEP, MAKE YOUR"
325,00:16:13.47,00:16:13.47,MOVE AND FOLLOW THE MAP AND LOOK FOR THE LANTERN.
326,00:16:18.07,00:16:18.07,YOU WILL FIND THE SECURITY YOU SEEK.
327,00:16:19.50,00:16:19.50,SO IT'S LIKE THE SAME TRAIL WE DID FOR THE MERGE.
328,00:16:22.33,00:16:22.33,"I HAD A BAD DAY TODAY, BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP."
329,00:16:24.77,00:16:24.77,"OH, I CAN'T WAIT."
330,00:16:25.87,00:16:25.87,I'M SO STOKED RIGHT NOW.
331,00:16:43.10,00:16:43.10,">> AS SOON AS THE MOON GOES DOWN, THE TEAM THAT WON CAME"
332,00:16:44.60,00:16:44.60,BACK FROM THEIR SPA TREATMENT.
333,00:16:46.30,00:16:46.30,EVERYBODY IS USUALLY IN BED READY FOR BED.
334,00:16:48.13,00:16:48.13,"I THOUGHT, THIS WILL BE SO EASY."
335,00:16:49.87,00:16:49.87,I'LL JUST GET UP.
336,00:16:50.73,00:16:50.73,THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE WATCHING ME.
337,00:16:53.83,00:16:53.83,">> YOU KNOW, YOU COME ON DOWN."
338,00:16:55.67,00:16:55.67,"YOU KNOW, GO... SO I'M LIKE, THIS IS RIDICULOUS."
339,00:16:58.97,00:16:58.97,"EVERYBODY IS BY THE FIRE, HANGING OUT, LIKE NO ONE EVER,"
340,00:17:02.03,00:17:02.03,THEY NEVER EVER DO THIS.
341,00:17:02.90,00:17:02.90,IT WAS CRAZY.
342,00:17:04.63,00:17:04.63,>> DON'T STAY UP ALL NIGHT NOW.
343,00:17:07.57,00:17:07.57,FINALLY I'M JUST LIKE I GOT TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
344,00:17:10.90,00:17:10.90,THAT FOOD HIT MY STOMACH.
345,00:17:12.27,00:17:12.27,THEN I MADE A DASH FOR IT.
346,00:17:13.70,00:17:13.70,I TOOK OFF.
347,00:17:23.47,00:17:23.47,IT WAS PARTISANSHIP BLACK.
348,00:17:24.67,00:17:24.67,"THERE'S ROCK, THERE'S TREES."
349,00:17:26.00,00:17:26.00,I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE.
350,00:17:27.63,00:17:27.63,THERE'S SNAKES AND EVERYTHING.
351,00:17:28.83,00:17:28.83,AND I'M JUST SMACKING BRANCHES OUT OF MY FACE.
352,00:17:33.20,00:17:33.20,FROM A DISTANCE I SEE A LITTLE GLOW.
353,00:17:35.43,00:17:35.43,SO I KIND OF TOOK OFF AFTER IT.
354,00:17:42.27,00:17:42.27,WHOA BABY.
355,00:17:42.77,00:17:42.77,LOOK AT THAT THING.
356,00:17:44.97,00:17:44.97,THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
357,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,"IDOLS THIS SEASON, THERE'S NO TWO IDOLS THAT LOOK THE SAME."
358,00:17:50.23,00:17:50.23,AND HACKING FROM THE LANTERN WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL THING.
359,00:17:55.53,00:17:55.53,WE GOT ANOTHER PIECE.
360,00:17:57.07,00:17:57.07,"IT TOOK ME TWO YEARS, BUT NOW I GOT TWO IDOLS, TWO HIDDEN IDOLS."
361,00:18:02.40,00:18:02.40,"TWO IDOL, ALL THE MORE AGGRESSIVE, THAT'S ME."
362,00:18:05.17,00:18:05.17,THIS IS AN IDOL.
363,00:18:07.30,00:18:07.30,THIS IS VAL'S IDOL.
364,00:18:09.03,00:18:09.03,THIS ONE IS VAL'S IDOL.
365,00:18:10.97,00:18:10.97,THE OTHER ONE IS VAL'S IDOL.
366,00:18:12.97,00:18:12.97,THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL THING.
367,00:18:14.23,00:18:14.23,I LOVE IT!
368,00:18:16.70,00:18:16.70,VAL IS MY WIFE.
369,00:18:17.90,00:18:17.90,VAL IS MY BEST FRIEND.
370,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,I CAN'T KEEP IT BOTTLED UP ANYMORE.
371,00:18:21.03,00:18:21.03,I'M DOING IT ALL FOR HER.
372,00:18:22.30,00:18:22.30,I JUST WANT TO MAKE HER LIFE A LITTLE EASIER.
373,00:18:24.63,00:18:24.63,I WANT TO MAKE LIFE EASIER.
374,00:18:28.90,00:18:28.90,AND I WANT TO MAKE MY NEXT CHILD'S LIFE A LITTLE EASIER.
375,00:18:37.77,00:18:37.77,"LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S A BY OR A GIRL, AND THAT'S BEEN"
376,00:18:41.37,00:18:41.37,BOTHERING ME A LITTLE BIT.
377,00:18:42.50,00:18:42.50,"LIKE I KNOW PEOPLE ARE AFTER ME, AND I GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHEN I"
378,00:18:45.47,00:18:45.47,CAN USE THESE IDOLS BECAUSE I GOT TO USE THEM AT THE RIGHT
379,00:18:48.27,00:18:48.27,TIME.
380,00:18:48.47,00:18:48.47,I JUST WANT VAL TO WIN.
381,00:18:49.97,00:18:49.97,I JUST WANT VAL TO WIN.
382,00:18:52.83,00:18:52.83,"SHE DESERVES IT MORE THAN ME, YOU KNOW?"
383,00:18:56.83,00:18:56.83,MAN.
384,00:19:13.37,00:19:13.37,>> NOTHING HAS CHANGED WITH YOU AND I AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
385,00:19:14.73,00:19:14.73,>> OKAY.
386,00:19:15.30,00:19:15.30,GOOD.
387,00:19:16.20,00:19:16.20,>> JOE IS SUPER CLOSE.

393,00:19:32.37,00:19:32.37,I TRUST KEITH.
394,00:19:33.10,00:19:33.10,I DON'T TRUST THE THREE GIRLS.
395,00:19:34.30,00:19:34.30,>> NO.
396,00:19:34.80,00:19:34.80,>> THEY HAVE A SORT OF SHARED ARROGANCE ABOUT HOW AWESOME THEY

398,00:19:40.77,00:19:40.77,I'M TIRED OF THE WAY THE GAME IS GOING.
