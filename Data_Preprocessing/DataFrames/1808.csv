1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:04.04,00:00:04.04,Survivor: Coach and Brendan struggled for
3,00:00:07.04,00:00:07.04,"control of Timbira. >> As much as I like leading,"
4,00:00:10.21,00:00:10.21,everybody trusts you as being the leader.
5,00:00:12.25,00:00:12.25,"If Brendan got voted off, and I was the leader, I think this"
6,00:00:15.04,00:00:15.04,tribe would be better. >> PROBST: And Tyson chose
7,00:00:17.04,00:00:17.04,sides. >> PROBST: Launch.
8,00:00:25.04,00:00:25.04,Jalapao took a beating. J.T. has lost a tooth.
9,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,>> Oh! >> PROBST: And they lost their
10,00:00:32.83,00:00:32.83,third immunity challenge in a row.
11,00:00:34.96,00:00:34.96,Timbira wins immunity! Brendan was saved from Tyson
12,00:00:38.54,00:00:38.54,"and Coach. At Jalapao, with Tribal Council"
13,00:00:42.42,00:00:42.42,"looming, and Taj and Stephen in control of the hidden immunity"
14,00:00:45.04,00:00:45.04,"idol, Taj reached out to J.T. >> Listen, I can't believe it's"
15,00:00:49.04,00:00:49.04,the real immunity idol. >> I know.
16,00:00:51.12,00:00:51.12,"Honestly, I don't want you and Stephen to go out prematurely."
17,00:00:55.21,00:00:55.21,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, the three stuck together."
18,00:00:58.75,00:00:58.75,"Sydney, the tribe has spoken. Down four members to Timbira's"
19,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,"six, Jalapao became a desperate tribe."
20,00:01:06.96,00:01:06.96,Ten are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
21,00:01:21.12,00:01:21.12,">> At Tribal Council, Sydney was voted out."
22,00:01:23.58,00:01:23.58,"It's bittersweet. I felt bad that she had to go,"
23,00:01:26.54,00:01:26.54,"but one of us had to go, and I'm glad it's not me."
24,00:01:31.46,00:01:31.46,">> After tonight's vote, I feel like the odd man out."
25,00:01:35.29,00:01:35.29,"Luckily, I wasn't, you know, the one being voted out."
26,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,"So, you get a little nervous. You get a little concerned when"
27,00:01:41.21,00:01:41.21,you see torch after torch getting put out.
28,00:01:45.00,00:01:45.00,"You know, it's not fun. It's not fun to lose."
29,00:01:47.21,00:01:47.21,It's not fun to vote people you like home.
30,00:02:11.50,00:02:11.50,>> Maybe it will change.  Captioning sponsored by

33,00:03:22.75,00:03:22.75,(thunder crackling) >> Do you see Coach out there?
34,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83,>> Yeah. >> He's meditating.
35,00:03:44.92,00:03:44.92,>> He's doing his morning meditation.
36,00:03:46.54,00:03:46.54,">> We're almost at day 20. Up till now, it's been about the"
37,00:03:49.92,00:03:49.92,team. So I've been trying to get
38,00:03:52.04,00:03:52.04,"along, but the little annoying things I've had to keep bottled"
39,00:03:54.12,00:03:54.12,in. I'm the kind of person that if I
40,00:03:56.67,00:03:56.67,"see it, I want to say, I want to nail it, get rid of it."
41,00:03:59.79,00:03:59.79,"And I was, like, you know what? I need to get centered."
42,00:04:02.62,00:04:02.62,I need to pray. I need to meditate.
43,00:04:04.62,00:04:04.62,And I spent about ten minutes out in the water just getting
44,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,"refocused, and it was, like, boom, and everything just"
45,00:04:09.21,00:04:09.21,clicked. You know?
46,00:04:11.08,00:04:11.08,"This is about me now. >> Oh, that feels so good."
47,00:04:17.12,00:04:17.12,">> We're so close to a merge. Could be today, could be three"
48,00:04:20.21,00:04:20.21,days. So I've been pacifying
49,00:04:22.42,00:04:22.42,everybody and getting along with the tribe.
50,00:04:26.08,00:04:26.08,">> Oh, my God! That's awesome."
51,00:04:31.71,00:04:31.71,Coach has a new thing: his morning meditation.
52,00:04:34.75,00:04:34.75,Just hanging out in the water. A little bit of this going on
53,00:04:37.46,00:04:37.46,every morning. If that's the thing that turned
54,00:04:40.50,00:04:40.50,"you into Mr. Nice Guy around camp, you do it every day."
55,00:04:43.62,00:04:43.62,"I will take you down there, hold your hand, push you in the"
56,00:04:46.29,00:04:46.29,"water, whatever needs to happen, because I like New Coach."
57,00:04:55.54,00:04:55.54,>> What will today bring? >> What do you mean by that?
58,00:04:59.00,00:04:59.00,>> Huh? >> Competition?
59,00:05:01.08,00:05:01.08,>> No. You're like a totally different person now.
60,00:05:06.67,00:05:06.67,>> Life is good. >> My relationship with Coach
61,00:05:12.46,00:05:12.46,to me has been good the whole time.
62,00:05:14.96,00:05:14.96,There's definitely been some things he's done around camp
63,00:05:16.79,00:05:16.79,which are kind of annoying or outside the box.
64,00:05:18.96,00:05:18.96,"And I mean, he's always... doing his hair, and we were"
65,00:05:24.58,00:05:24.58,"talking about it, and it's like, ""I kind of"
66,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17,"started the samurai thing."" And I was, like, ""Started the"
67,00:05:28.50,00:05:28.50,"samurai thing?"" Like, they've been doing it for,"
68,00:05:30.96,00:05:30.96,"like, thousand of years in Japan, and Johnny Depp's been"
69,00:05:33.04,00:05:33.04,"doing it for, like, 20 years here."
70,00:05:35.12,00:05:35.12,You didn't start anything. >> It's like a knot.
71,00:05:49.25,00:05:49.25,>> I know. Feel it.
72,00:05:51.29,00:05:51.29,>> Oh. >> Feel how hot it is.
73,00:05:53.79,00:05:53.79,">> Yeah. Oh, shoot."
74,00:05:55.62,00:05:55.62,Yeah. >> It was all the way out here
75,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,"yesterday, and now it's just right there, so..."
76,00:06:00.29,00:06:00.29,>> What got into it that made it... got it infected?
77,00:06:03.33,00:06:03.33,>> A little bug? >> A bug?
78,00:06:05.12,00:06:05.12,">> Like, a little, you know, bacteria or parasite."
79,00:06:07.29,00:06:07.29,>> Phew! The only thing that concerns me
80,00:06:11.25,00:06:11.25,about Joe right now is his leg. His leg is very swollen and red
81,00:06:14.54,00:06:14.54,from the knee down. It doesn't look good to me.
82,00:06:17.21,00:06:17.21,"He swears that it's getting better, but I don't know."
83,00:06:20.25,00:06:20.25,"With these two eyes, they don't look too good to me."
84,00:06:27.42,00:06:27.42,">> I'm gonna post up in the hammock for a bit, man."
85,00:06:31.08,00:06:31.08,">> Joe has a... kind of a bummed-up leg, and he's down and"
86,00:06:35.38,00:06:35.38,"out, and, you know, um, if there is a merge, even if there isn't"
87,00:06:38.67,00:06:38.67,"a merge, we're still... Jalapao is still down to four"
88,00:06:41.58,00:06:41.58,"members, and things are really not looking our way."
89,00:06:43.62,00:06:43.62,So there's a lot at stake for every one of us if we want a
90,00:06:46.71,00:06:46.71,"shot in this game, and this is definitely the biggest challenge"
91,00:06:49.21,00:06:49.21,"yet. >> Well, did we get tree mail?"
92,00:07:00.46,00:07:00.46,>> So...? >> Let's read it.
93,00:07:03.25,00:07:03.25,">> Coach, your hair tie. One for you."
94,00:07:07.08,00:07:07.08,">> I'll have this. >> ""Head to head, face to face,"
95,00:07:10.46,00:07:10.46,here's another to get your heads spinning.
96,00:07:12.62,00:07:12.62,Getting away from camp and a feast is what you'll end up
97,00:07:15.29,00:07:15.29,"winning."" >> ""Here's another to get your"
98,00:07:17.75,00:07:17.75,"heads spinning."" >> Spinning."
99,00:07:20.58,00:07:20.58,">> ""Here's another to get your heads spinning."
100,00:07:23.38,00:07:23.38,"Getting away from camp..."" >> BOTH: ""And a feast."""
101,00:07:26.38,00:07:26.38,">> ""Is what you'll end up winning?"""
102,00:07:28.21,00:07:28.21,>> Oh! Oh!
103,00:07:30.17,00:07:30.17,>> It could be a merge. It could be a merge.
104,00:07:32.04,00:07:32.04,>> Oh! >> Merge. It could be a merge.
105,00:07:34.12,00:07:34.12,">> I just want it to say, ""Let's go eat."""
106,00:07:36.50,00:07:36.50,"Whoever wins this challenge today-- they apparently, get"
107,00:07:38.29,00:07:38.29,"this huge feast, and I get excited when I hear anything"
108,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,"that starts with an ""F."" (laughs)"
109,00:07:44.21,00:07:44.21,">> Y'all, we got to win a feast. >> I think it's a merge."
110,00:07:46.54,00:07:46.54,>> I think it's a reward challenge.
111,00:07:48.58,00:07:48.58,>> Let's take bets. I'll eat your parts of the feast
112,00:07:50.96,00:07:50.96,if it's a merge. >> No. I'm not sharing mine.
113,00:07:52.79,00:07:52.79,>> No. Let's just win whatever it is.
114,00:07:54.58,00:07:54.58,">> Whatever it is, we'll win. >> I'm real hard on myself when"
115,00:07:56.83,00:07:56.83,I lose. I hate losing.
116,00:07:58.42,00:07:58.42,"I'm a sore loser. So, if it's a merge, ball game's"
117,00:08:01.17,00:08:01.17,on. That's the reason maybe I'm
118,00:08:03.50,00:08:03.50,"kind of hoping it's a challenge. I don't know if I'm ready yet,"
119,00:08:06.08,00:08:06.08,"but, uh, I feel like I got to redeem myself."
120,00:08:09.38,00:08:09.38,It's really fixing to hit the fan.
121,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,">> Oh, wow, dude! (cheering)"
122,00:08:39.04,00:08:39.04,>> There's candy! (cheering)
123,00:08:43.08,00:08:43.08,>> Give me some water without bugs in it!
124,00:08:47.12,00:08:47.12,">> J.T., you have a sultry voice; you do the honors."
125,00:08:50.21,00:08:50.21,">> Let's hear it, big guy. >> ""Congratulations, tribes."
126,00:08:52.29,00:08:52.29,"You have merged."" (all cheering)"
127,00:08:54.54,00:08:54.54,"""...Replace your old buffs with the new."
128,00:08:57.04,00:08:57.04,">> I love the green. >> ""You must come up with a new"
129,00:08:59.25,00:08:59.25,"tribe name, design a new tribe flag and begin the next phase of"
130,00:09:02.38,00:09:02.38,your adventure. You will all live at the old
131,00:09:04.67,00:09:04.67,Timbira camp. >> All right!
132,00:09:07.21,00:09:07.21,">> ""All of your personal reward items will be at your new camp"
133,00:09:10.17,00:09:10.17,"when you arrive. Good luck. Enjoy your feast."""
134,00:09:14.17,00:09:14.17,>> Yeah! (cheering)
135,00:09:16.42,00:09:16.42,">> Let's eat! >> Pig out, man!"
136,00:09:18.75,00:09:18.75,>> Our biggest hope was that today was the merge feast.
137,00:09:21.92,00:09:21.92,Less the merge than the merge feast.
138,00:09:24.67,00:09:24.67,Jalapao is freaking hungry. >> Those are real good.
139,00:09:28.42,00:09:28.42,>> Those are real good! >> I was going crazy!
140,00:09:31.17,00:09:31.17,">> Yeah, Tyson's kind of like a girl."
141,00:09:34.21,00:09:34.21,>> A toast? >> Yeah.
142,00:09:35.67,00:09:35.67,">> Here's to Survivor and all of us for making it, trying our"
143,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,"hardest and the merge. Hear, hear!"
144,00:09:40.21,00:09:40.21,">> Hear, hear! >> Clink, clink, clink!"
145,00:09:42.71,00:09:42.71,">> The feast, man, was cool because we're meeting new"
146,00:09:45.04,00:09:45.04,"people. You know, it's like getting"
147,00:09:46.54,00:09:46.54,a new girlfriend. There's all kinds of things to
148,00:09:48.46,00:09:48.46,explore. (screaming)
149,00:09:52.29,00:09:52.29,I just wish we could have decimated the tribe a little
150,00:09:54.50,00:09:54.50,bit more. We had them on the ropes.
151,00:09:57.21,00:09:57.21,They were going to go down and I think we could have won the
152,00:09:59.17,00:09:59.17,rest of them. But it's all good.
153,00:10:01.12,00:10:01.12,"We're in control, baby. We're in control."
154,00:10:03.38,00:10:03.38,We can be in control for the rest of the way.
155,00:10:05.17,00:10:05.17,">> So, anybody got any history, secrets, and stuff?"
156,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,I don't have nothing. I'm a poor cattle farmer.
157,00:10:09.54,00:10:09.54,">> And you're a rocket scientist, though."
158,00:10:11.08,00:10:11.08,">> Yeah, I am a rocket scientist."
159,00:10:12.46,00:10:12.46,>> What do y'all...  what do you do? 
160,00:10:14.04,00:10:14.04,">> I'm a soccer coach, but also a symphony conductor in"
161,00:10:15.71,00:10:15.71,California. >> Symphony instructor?
162,00:10:18.12,00:10:18.12,">> Conductor, I'm a maestro. So I do... I have two jobs."
163,00:10:21.29,00:10:21.29,I fly back and forth between  the two.
164,00:10:22.75,00:10:22.75,"I like J.T., man. He's a warrior."
165,00:10:24.25,00:10:24.25,I'm looking forward to getting to know him.
166,00:10:27.00,00:10:27.00,"And Stephen, I mean, he's obviously intelligent and as"
167,00:10:28.92,00:10:28.92,"long as... I mean, I look forward to these individual"
168,00:10:30.75,00:10:30.75,"immunity challenges, especially in the beginning when we've got"
169,00:10:33.25,00:10:33.25,all the big horses and alpha males together.
170,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,"That's gonna be awesome. >> We need a new tribe name,"
171,00:10:37.17,00:10:37.17,you guys. >> Anybody know Portuguese?
172,00:10:39.50,00:10:39.50,">> I looked up ""Will to Overcome"" and that was dingus,"
173,00:10:42.75,00:10:42.75,"I guess, d-i-n-g-u-s. >> In Portuguese?"
174,00:10:45.17,00:10:45.17,">> Yeah. >> I don't know about dingus,"
175,00:10:46.79,00:10:46.79,"man; I mean, that sounds like a good meaning, but dingus"
176,00:10:48.92,00:10:48.92,"sounds a little bit too crazy. >> I can't hear Jeff saying,"
177,00:10:50.79,00:10:50.79,"""Come on in, Dingus."" >> I'm in!"
178,00:10:53.29,00:10:53.29,>> I think it has a nice ring to it.
179,00:10:55.12,00:10:55.12,>> Any other suggestions? >> Forza.
180,00:10:57.17,00:10:57.17,F-o-r-z-a is like strength in Portuguese.
181,00:10:59.75,00:10:59.75,">> Forza. >> Forza, which means strength."
182,00:11:02.42,00:11:02.42,">> Easy to say.  It took us, like, three days to"
183,00:11:04.33,00:11:04.33,"get Jalapao down.  >> I know it's a touchy subject,"
184,00:11:07.62,00:11:07.62,"but if we don't want to talk about it now, that's fine. "
185,00:11:10.33,00:11:10.33,We're just shocked by the last two votes.
186,00:11:16.17,00:11:16.17,>> Good. >> Yeah.
187,00:11:19.08,00:11:19.08,">> So, you guys didn't come up with the idea of who was going"
188,00:11:21.38,00:11:21.38,"home? It was kind of just, like, off"
189,00:11:23.04,00:11:23.04,the cuff? >> It was so... it was so big.
190,00:11:26.12,00:11:26.12,I don't know. It's hard to talk about 'cause
191,00:11:27.54,00:11:27.54,"it was so big, you know? >> I was sort of tiptoeing"
192,00:11:29.33,00:11:29.33,around Sierra because you do need to be discreet with how
193,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,"much information you give out. You know, these are your future"
194,00:11:35.21,00:11:35.21,"competitors, so you can't just be giving away your entire tribe"
195,00:11:38.67,00:11:38.67,dynamic. >> You guys are all great
196,00:11:41.12,00:11:41.12,"competitors, and it's been a lot of fun, you know, competing"
197,00:11:43.00,00:11:43.00,against you. >> So are you guys.
198,00:11:44.83,00:11:44.83,">> And when you guys win, I think we all appreciate, you"
199,00:11:46.29,00:11:46.29,"know, definitely how well you've done."
200,00:11:48.96,00:11:48.96,">> Well, thanks. >> I was really worried about"
201,00:11:50.79,00:11:50.79,"the merge because traditionally, if you're"
202,00:11:52.83,00:11:52.83,"outnumbered four to six going into a merge, you're sitting"
203,00:11:54.88,00:11:54.88,ducks. >> Y'all got some fishing holes.
204,00:11:57.12,00:11:57.12,>> You've got to catch us fish. We have not eaten a fish yet.
205,00:12:00.08,00:12:00.08,>> Fish man right there. >> I'm really worried about
206,00:12:02.12,00:12:02.12,the numbers. I hope that there's a power
207,00:12:04.17,00:12:04.17,struggle in the old Timbira and I can exploit that.
208,00:12:07.25,00:12:07.25,"Going into this four on six, that's not good odds."
209,00:12:24.92,00:12:24.92,>> Welcome to your new house. >> Thanks.
210,00:12:27.29,00:12:27.29,>> Look at that umbrella. Look at all the pots we got.
211,00:12:29.92,00:12:29.92,">> Awesome. >> Oh, my God!"
212,00:12:31.71,00:12:31.71,">> Let's put that tarp out, like right away."
213,00:12:33.33,00:12:33.33,">> It's like a real fixer-upper. >> Hey, guys."
214,00:12:35.58,00:12:35.58,It's raining. Let's put the tarp up.
215,00:12:38.75,00:12:38.75,">> Oh, my God. >> I'm soaking wet."
216,00:12:41.50,00:12:41.50,>> That tarp is only as big as that one spot right there.
217,00:12:44.12,00:12:44.12,">> You know, we're walking into the old Timbira camp, and first"
218,00:12:46.54,00:12:46.54,"of all, we come up to a little dog house shelter, and I'm like,"
219,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,"""What is this?"" You know, I mean, I don't know"
220,00:12:52.75,00:12:52.75,"how it was still standing. >> We should take this top off,"
221,00:12:55.33,00:12:55.33,just start pulling everything off and then just rebuild it.
222,00:12:58.25,00:12:58.25,"Not rebuild necessarily the bottom, but take the top off,"
223,00:13:00.92,00:13:00.92,"just pull it all off, and then just start from scratch."
224,00:13:03.21,00:13:03.21,">> You guys, should we do a tour and show everybody the back"
225,00:13:05.46,00:13:05.46,beach and the front beach and all that before... so they have
226,00:13:07.79,00:13:07.79,kind of a feeling of the camp? >> Yeah.
227,00:13:11.21,00:13:11.21,>> We got a pot full of beans out there that's about half
228,00:13:14.42,00:13:14.42,cooked. >> Let's see the tour.
229,00:13:16.75,00:13:16.75,>> The Timbira people are definitely running the show.
230,00:13:19.42,00:13:19.42,It's definitely intimidating to go into the merge down in
231,00:13:22.21,00:13:22.21,numbers. They can pick us off if they
232,00:13:24.42,00:13:24.42,"want, you know. We're dependent on their good"
233,00:13:26.83,00:13:26.83,"graces. So, even if we make allies with"
234,00:13:29.12,00:13:29.12,"them, those allies are in the dominant position."
235,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,">> It's not near as big as you'd think, is it?"
236,00:13:37.25,00:13:37.25,"You fish much? >> Yeah, I do, uh... I do mainly"
237,00:13:40.38,00:13:40.38,"fly-fishing. It's just, uh... I like the art"
238,00:13:43.96,00:13:43.96,"of... of the cast. But, uh... I'm by no means an"
239,00:13:48.38,00:13:48.38,expert. (laughing)
240,00:13:52.12,00:13:52.12,>> You see them jumping at it? >> I see.
241,00:13:53.71,00:13:53.71,"I felt it as soon as I put it in there, man."
242,00:13:56.21,00:13:56.21,I knew the first time that I... that I looked at J.T.-- I saw
243,00:13:58.83,00:13:58.83,"the cowboy boots, open, honest face, and I said to myself,"
244,00:14:04.04,00:14:04.04,"""He is a good old boy."" We're kindred spirits."
245,00:14:06.38,00:14:06.38,We both love the outdoors. I think that we're both
246,00:14:09.12,00:14:09.12,warriors. Let's talk about the game a
247,00:14:10.88,00:14:10.88,"little bit while we're fishing, man."
248,00:14:12.62,00:14:12.62,"How about it? >> Man, I'm... I'm up for"
249,00:14:16.29,00:14:16.29,"anything, man. It's not even 15 minutes, and"
250,00:14:19.75,00:14:19.75,Coach is ready to talk about the game.
251,00:14:22.46,00:14:22.46,"And it was perfect. I mean, I was... I couldn't wait"
252,00:14:26.17,00:14:26.17,"to talk to him about the game. From what I know, Brendan"
253,00:14:29.38,00:14:29.38,thinks he's in control of the game pretty much.
254,00:14:32.33,00:14:32.33,>> Who told you that? >> Taj.
255,00:14:35.04,00:14:35.04,"I'm 95% sure he's got the idol. >> So, you swear to me that Taj"
256,00:14:39.38,00:14:39.38,does not have it. >> I don't know if she's got it
257,00:14:41.33,00:14:41.33,"or not. If she does, there's two idols."
258,00:14:45.25,00:14:45.25,">> That's crazy. All right, I'm going to tell"
259,00:14:47.96,00:14:47.96,"you a couple of things. Um, when we talk, for now, let's"
260,00:14:51.62,00:14:51.62,"keep it confidential. >> 100%, dude."
261,00:14:54.75,00:14:54.75,>> Just between you and I. I said in the very beginning of
262,00:14:57.29,00:14:57.29,"this game to everybody, I will not lie one time on this game,"
263,00:15:00.96,00:15:00.96,so let's just keep it honest between us.
264,00:15:03.38,00:15:03.38,"Let's keep it real. >> I'll keep it real, Coach."
265,00:15:06.00,00:15:06.00,I've seen cracks right away. I had some ideas before I
266,00:15:08.54,00:15:08.54,ever... before there ever was a merge.
267,00:15:10.33,00:15:10.33,It's hard to keep six people from different walks of life to
268,00:15:13.00,00:15:13.00,stick together when they hate each other.
269,00:15:15.21,00:15:15.21,"So, I'm just here to make sure everybody hates each other."
270,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,"If Brendan... if Brendan has got that idol, we got... we're going"
271,00:15:20.88,00:15:20.88,to have to blindside him. >> I have a lot of emotions
272,00:15:23.71,00:15:23.71,going on. I have said that I felt Brendan
273,00:15:26.00,00:15:26.00,"was maybe a little bit squirrelly, but if you flat out"
274,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,"lied to me, you better be prepared to go to war."
275,00:15:37.00,00:15:37.00,I talked to J.T. >> Mm-hmm.
276,00:15:40.00,00:15:40.00,>> And the reason why I did is because I told you in the very
277,00:15:42.75,00:15:42.75,"beginning, you know, that he and I had, like, this rapport..."
278,00:15:44.75,00:15:44.75,>> Mm-hmm. >> ...without talking.
279,00:15:47.75,00:15:47.75,"I know him; he's a good old boy. Well, check this out."
280,00:15:50.75,00:15:50.75,Brendan has the idol. >> I thought so.
281,00:15:53.29,00:15:53.29,>> I want you to think about an alliance with Stephen and J.T.
282,00:15:58.67,00:15:58.67,">> Here's what we do. Me, you, J.T., Stephen, Debbie."
283,00:16:02.04,00:16:02.04,"We keep that five, we can take it."
284,00:16:04.33,00:16:04.33,>> It's time to go for the jugular.
285,00:16:06.25,00:16:06.25,Brendan is the head of the dragon.
286,00:16:08.17,00:16:08.17,"When you want to defeat the army, you cut off the head of"
287,00:16:10.42,00:16:10.42,the dragon. For him to go out as the first
288,00:16:12.46,00:16:12.46,"person from the merge... Mm, yes, I love it."
289,00:16:17.79,00:16:17.79,"I mean, that's awesome. >> Oh, good."
290,00:16:44.46,00:16:44.46,All right. We've definitely found inroads
291,00:16:48.58,00:16:48.58,into Timbira. This is clearly a very fractured
292,00:16:51.12,00:16:51.12,"tribe because there's no strong bonds and sense of place, so"
293,00:16:55.21,00:16:55.21,there's a lot of power dynamics at play that are very easy to
294,00:16:58.17,00:16:58.17,exploit. >> Yeah.
295,00:17:08.92,00:17:08.92,(laughing) >> I want you to catch one.
296,00:17:34.29,00:17:34.29,>> Okay. >> Just put it out as far as
297,00:17:36.17,00:17:36.17,it can reach. >> Should I keep bringing it
298,00:17:38.50,00:17:38.50,"out and... >> No, you can leave it in"
299,00:17:40.25,00:17:40.25,there. Unless the... took it off
300,00:17:42.00,00:17:42.00,"already. >> I got one, dude."
301,00:17:43.75,00:17:43.75,">> Huh, pull it up. Pull it in."
302,00:17:47.00,00:17:47.00,"Oh, it's a little baby catfish. Pull him all the way in."
303,00:17:50.79,00:17:50.79,"Catfish-- let me tell ya, they got little fins that are, they"
304,00:17:54.08,00:17:54.08,"supposedly poisonous. >> Oh, really?"
305,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,">> See, he's got little razors on the back of them fins."
306,00:17:59.12,00:17:59.12,"See, watch him close them down on me."
307,00:18:00.96,00:18:00.96,>> I was hoping for a big one. >> Ow. Look at this.
308,00:18:03.21,00:18:03.21,What kind of catfish is this? >> (laughs) I don't know!
309,00:18:05.79,00:18:05.79,A dangerous one? >> It is.
310,00:18:08.29,00:18:08.29,I'll put him back. That little bastard.
311,00:18:11.08,00:18:11.08,...right there. I expected to not get along
312,00:18:14.58,00:18:14.58,with Tyson at all. We talked a lot of smack at
313,00:18:17.17,00:18:17.17,"each other, pushed each other around, and now, you know, when"
314,00:18:20.33,00:18:20.33,"you get on the same tribe and you go for individual immunity,"
315,00:18:23.92,00:18:23.92,"you're still competing against the guy, but you're living with"
316,00:18:26.17,00:18:26.17,him. It's a little different now.
317,00:18:28.17,00:18:28.17,Stephen's the only guy that I can vouch for 100%.
318,00:18:31.08,00:18:31.08,"You know, so... >> And with me it's Coach, and"
319,00:18:33.08,00:18:33.08,as far as... >> That's what Coach told me.
320,00:18:35.08,00:18:35.08,"Whatever y'all wanna do, I'm with y'all."
321,00:18:36.88,00:18:36.88,">> 'Cause I was thinking of getting rid of Brendan like,"
322,00:18:38.42,00:18:38.42,"since, like, two or three eliminations ago."
323,00:18:41.12,00:18:41.12,>> He's gonna be surprised as hell. 
324,00:18:43.08,00:18:43.08,>> I'm one of the guys that... >> I'd like to get rid of
325,00:18:47.71,00:18:47.71,Brendan. He's the biggest threat. 
326,00:18:49.67,00:18:49.67,"He just seems like a sneaky bastard, you know."
327,00:18:52.25,00:18:52.25,I can't look him in the eye and believe a word he says.
328,00:18:55.00,00:18:55.00,You can look me in my sweet blue eyes all day and I'll tell you
329,00:18:58.92,00:18:58.92,sweet nothings and you'll believe all of them. 
330,00:19:05.21,00:19:05.21,"Debbie, you want to go, uh, grab some firewood?"
331,00:19:07.67,00:19:07.67,Do you think we need some? >> Sure.
332,00:19:09.92,00:19:09.92,"We'll go grab some of the timber and logs, yeah."
333,00:19:15.00,00:19:15.00,">> I'll grab that log on that back beach, at least."
334,00:19:20.04,00:19:20.04,">> After the two tribes merged, I was thinking we're probably"
335,00:19:24.42,00:19:24.42,"safe, Stephen and myself, because of the secret alliance"
336,00:19:28.04,00:19:28.04,that we have between us and Brendan and Sierra.
337,00:19:32.04,00:19:32.04,"But they haven't even made any signs or signals, so, it kind"
338,00:19:34.71,00:19:34.71,"of, it makes me think that they're going to stick behind"
339,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17,their tribe right now. I went into Exile with Brendan
340,00:19:40.71,00:19:40.71,three times. >> What do you think is going
341,00:19:42.29,00:19:42.29,on? >> I don't know.
342,00:19:43.96,00:19:43.96,I don't know.  I can't tell if he's still with
343,00:19:45.75,00:19:45.75,us or not. I can't tell at all.
344,00:19:47.88,00:19:47.88,"I just, I feel like he's not doing the things that he was"
345,00:19:51.42,00:19:51.42,saying he was going to do before.
346,00:19:57.50,00:19:57.50,">> My Exile alliance with Taj, Sierra, and Stephen is still"
347,00:20:01.96,00:20:01.96,"kind of laying low, which is what I think it needs to do"
348,00:20:04.71,00:20:04.71,because that alliance is only effective once the numbers get
349,00:20:08.08,00:20:08.08,"down to seven or eight. And so, right now, Joe needs to"
350,00:20:11.12,00:20:11.12,"go, J.T. needs to go, and then my Exile alliance can kind of"
351,00:20:14.92,00:20:14.92,take charge if need be. >> Coach talked with J.T.
352,00:20:19.08,00:20:19.08,last night really good. >> Okay.
353,00:20:20.96,00:20:20.96,">> J.T.'s a straight shooter, good guy."
354,00:20:22.58,00:20:22.58,>> Okay. >> He said he trusted Stephen
355,00:20:24.25,00:20:24.25,with all his life. >> Okay.
356,00:20:26.04,00:20:26.04,">> Here's the alliance now. You, me, Coach, J.T., Stephen."
357,00:20:31.62,00:20:31.62,>> I like J.T. and Stephen both. >> They're both...
358,00:20:34.12,00:20:34.12,>> Straight shooters. >> Here he comes.
359,00:20:36.12,00:20:36.12,>> Okay. >> Wood?
360,00:20:39.12,00:20:39.12,">> Do you think Joe? >> Yeah, I think so."
361,00:20:41.54,00:20:41.54,What do you think? >> That's what I thought.
362,00:20:46.25,00:20:46.25,"I mean, he's injured, so he's not going to be able to compete"
363,00:20:49.12,00:20:49.12,"at stuff, don't you think? >> Um, yeah."
364,00:20:52.04,00:20:52.04,">> I was going to go grab that log because it was easy, but..."
365,00:20:54.04,00:20:54.04,"and it burned long, but if not, we'll just, where should we go?"
366,00:20:57.38,00:20:57.38,Anywhere? >> We don't have much time.
367,00:20:59.71,00:20:59.71,">> Yeah, we only need the little stuff."
368,00:21:01.50,00:21:01.50,">> I talked with Brendan, and, uh, I just wanted to kind of"
369,00:21:04.54,00:21:04.54,let him feel like that I was still on board with whatever
370,00:21:07.12,00:21:07.12,plan he had. I do feel proud being a better
371,00:21:09.50,00:21:09.50,schemer than Brendan. He's supposed to be this
372,00:21:11.88,00:21:11.88,"big-league businessman who gets businesses rolling, makes them"
373,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,tons of money. He's like putty in my hands.
374,00:21:18.96,00:21:18.96,I can mold this game however I I want right now.
375,00:21:21.46,00:21:21.46,">> Okay, first of all, did you find yours?"
376,00:21:24.83,00:21:24.83,>> Found it? >> Uh-huh?
377,00:21:28.08,00:21:28.08,>> I got to get back to camp. (laughing)
378,00:21:33.29,00:21:33.29,">> Based on the clues from Exile, I was able to figure out"
379,00:21:36.08,00:21:36.08,"that there were most likely two idols, and Joe and I decided"
380,00:21:39.62,00:21:39.62,that we were going to work together and see if we can maybe
381,00:21:41.92,00:21:41.92,"find both. >> So, you don't know where it"
382,00:21:43.75,00:21:43.75,"is? >> Oh, no, not at all."
383,00:21:46.92,00:21:46.92,>> I can't even trust you. (giggling)
384,00:21:49.67,00:21:49.67,I don't know what you're doing. It's a simple question.
385,00:21:52.46,00:21:52.46,I'm asking if you have the immunity idol.
386,00:21:54.83,00:21:54.83,>> I don't have it. We're here.
387,00:21:59.08,00:21:59.08,>> You know where it is? You bend over.
388,00:22:02.25,00:22:02.25,>> Yeah. >> Do this.
389,00:22:03.54,00:22:03.54,>> Yeah. >> It's not there.
390,00:22:05.33,00:22:05.33,>> It's not there anymore. >> The idol is not there.
391,00:22:07.62,00:22:07.62,>> Yeah. There was a very specific
392,00:22:09.25,00:22:09.25,pocket where something should have been on the back of that
393,00:22:11.67,00:22:11.67,tree mail post. There's nothing in there.
394,00:22:14.54,00:22:14.54,"So, we can assume that Brendan or Sierra has the idol."
395,00:22:17.46,00:22:17.46,"We'll vote them both out and, uh, then we can actually play"
396,00:22:20.54,00:22:20.54,"the game for real. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
397,00:22:40.25,00:22:40.25,How's everybody doing? >> Awesome.
398,00:22:42.00,00:22:42.00,">> Great. >> PROBST: J.T., what's the name"
399,00:22:43.83,00:22:43.83,of the new tribe? >> Forza.

406,00:23:00.29,00:23:00.29,"Tribal immunity, no more.  We're now in the individual"
407,00:23:05.25,00:23:05.25,portion of the game.  This is what you covet.
408,00:23:08.08,00:23:08.08,A beautiful individual immunity necklace. 
409,00:23:11.71,00:23:11.71,"If you're wearing this, you're safe in this game."
410,00:23:14.00,00:23:14.00,"Cannot be voted out. If you don't have immunity,"
411,00:23:16.17,00:23:16.17,you are vulnerable. Today's challenge is very
412,00:23:18.79,00:23:18.79,simple. Each of you will hold on to a 
413,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,"pole for as long as you can. >> Oh, man."
414,00:23:25.83,00:23:25.83,">> PROBST: When you fall off the pole, you're out of the "
415,00:23:27.42,00:23:27.42,challenge. Last person left hanging on the

417,00:23:34.21,00:23:34.21,"Losers, Tribal Council, where one of you will be voted out."
418,00:23:37.21,00:23:37.21,Big stakes. We'll draw for spots and get
419,00:23:39.38,00:23:39.38,started. This challenge is officially on.

445,00:26:03.08,00:26:03.08,All vying for that first individual immunity.
446,00:26:06.54,00:26:06.54,The only way to make sure you are safe tonight is to have

479,00:28:50.00,00:28:50.00,Tyson's safe at tonight's Tribal Council.
480,00:28:52.21,00:28:52.21,"The rest of you, one of you guys going home tonight."
481,00:28:54.96,00:28:54.96,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.

483,00:28:57.71,00:28:57.71,look. Everybody else head back to
484,00:28:59.29,00:28:59.29,camp. Congrats.
485,00:29:01.83,00:29:01.83,>> Am I staying here? >> PROBST: I just want to have
486,00:29:03.75,00:29:03.75,medical take a look at you. Can we get medical to come in
487,00:29:05.42,00:29:05.42,and take a look at Joe? >> It's real scary right now
488,00:29:10.42,00:29:10.42,because I'm having to trust people I just met.
489,00:29:13.04,00:29:13.04,"You know, what I gotta do is just remain strong to what I"
490,00:29:16.71,00:29:16.71,"hope is a firm alliance. You know, I really don't have"
491,00:29:19.00,00:29:19.00,any other options. I have to trust Coach and Tyson
492,00:29:21.21,00:29:21.21,"right now. And if I'm still here tomorrow,"
493,00:29:23.83,00:29:23.83,I'm not worried about old Timbira anymore.
494,00:29:45.04,00:29:45.04,">> Yeah, that, that hurt. >> That's sore."
495,00:29:47.29,00:29:47.29,">> Yeah, that's sore. >> PROBST: You feel it more?"
496,00:29:49.54,00:29:49.54,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: You're not sounding
497,00:29:52.88,00:29:52.88,"optimistic, Lucy. >> This is really swollen, so, I"
498,00:29:57.08,00:29:57.08,have to make an assumption that there's a bunch of pus under
499,00:29:59.83,00:29:59.83,"there, um... >> PROBST: I got a question,"
500,00:30:03.29,00:30:03.29,"too, at this point. What's your take?"
501,00:30:05.08,00:30:05.08,Are you... you still want to stay in the game?
502,00:30:08.12,00:30:08.12,>> I want to stay in the game. >> PROBST: Okay.
503,00:30:10.04,00:30:10.04,">> Yeah, I mean, I want you all to tell me if you don't go home"
504,00:30:12.54,00:30:12.54,"right now, you're going to lose the leg."
505,00:30:14.29,00:30:14.29,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: What's at risk for
506,00:30:16.54,00:30:16.54,him right now? What are you most concerned
507,00:30:18.04,00:30:18.04,"about, Lucy? >> Unfortunately, because this"
508,00:30:20.75,00:30:20.75,"infection is so close to the bone, is that the infection"
509,00:30:24.33,00:30:24.33,"could actually enter your bone, and that's a bad infection."
510,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,"Um, the other risk is that the infection goes to your blood,"
511,00:30:33.08,00:30:33.08,"and that's extremely dangerous. In that regard, that can risk"
512,00:30:37.25,00:30:37.25,death. This won't heal itself tomorrow.
513,00:30:46.88,00:30:46.88,>> Very beautiful. >> Right on the lips.
514,00:30:51.04,00:30:51.04,">> I love you. >> I love you, too, sweetie."
515,00:30:52.79,00:30:52.79,"Here, want to try it on? >> Yeah."
516,00:30:55.71,00:30:55.71,">> Yeah, so, I kick ass, like I always do, and, uh, if any"
517,00:31:00.96,00:31:00.96,"ladies want my phone number, I guess, uh... ask."
518,00:31:06.79,00:31:06.79,(thunder rumbling) >> Wowee.
519,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,Is it going to rain all afternoon?
520,00:31:16.08,00:31:16.08,>> We immediately knew something was up with Joe
521,00:31:18.96,00:31:18.96,because he hadn't come back from the immunity challenge.
522,00:31:22.08,00:31:22.08,">> I hope Joe's okay. >> Oh, yeah."
523,00:31:26.29,00:31:26.29,>> We're hoping we can take out Brendan tonight.
524,00:31:29.21,00:31:29.21,"But, honestly, I've known these people for two days."
525,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,They're obviously crafty people. That's why they're out here.
526,00:31:35.33,00:31:35.33,"So, I don't trust anyone, but you've got to go with your gut"
527,00:31:37.58,00:31:37.58,sometimes in this game. You gotta make desperate
528,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,"moves sometimes in this game, and I think this is one of them"
529,00:31:41.71,00:31:41.71,for me. >> Are your forearms all
530,00:31:44.92,00:31:44.92,jacked up? >> I only held with my fingers
531,00:31:47.12,00:31:47.12,"and my toes the whole time. Even coming down, I just"
532,00:31:49.17,00:31:49.17,like... >> You were probably smart to
533,00:31:50.83,00:31:50.83,not have shoes on. >> When I climbed down a
534,00:31:52.33,00:31:52.33,"little bit, like, it loosened me up."
535,00:31:54.08,00:31:54.08,">> That's how I fell off, when I went to stretch."
536,00:31:57.88,00:31:57.88,>> I kept trying to do that. >> Mine kept falling out.
537,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,"I couldn't get it to stay in. >> Lying to everybody,"
538,00:32:22.00,00:32:22.00,"especially Brendan and Sierra, actually brings me pleasure."
539,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,"In my alliance now, Stephen and J.T. have replaced Brendan and"
540,00:32:28.46,00:32:28.46,Sierra. I never liked Sierra ever.
541,00:32:31.42,00:32:31.42,I have no clue why she's out here other than to just give
542,00:32:34.00,00:32:34.00,hope to stupid people around the world.
543,00:32:40.21,00:32:40.21,">> Hey, it's the way it is, man. >> I know, I know."
544,00:32:42.50,00:32:42.50,>> It's the way it is. >> That's the way it is.
545,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,">> And Brendan, he's really the sneakiest bastard I have to"
546,00:32:51.38,00:32:51.38,worry about. We smile at each other; we hug.
547,00:32:54.71,00:32:54.71,I've kissed him on the neck softly.
548,00:32:57.04,00:32:57.04,"He's felt my warm, steamy breath on the nape of his neck, even on"
549,00:33:01.21,00:33:01.21,"the small of his back. But, you know, as the old adage"
550,00:33:05.58,00:33:05.58,"goes, keep your friends close and your enemies closer."
551,00:33:08.21,00:33:08.21,"That's right, right? >> Here's the thing: if I go"
552,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,"with you, you know... There's two basic alliances,"
553,00:33:17.00,00:33:17.00,right. I know I can get to the final
554,00:33:19.00,00:33:19.00,"four with Taj and Brendan. And I will go with you, with"
555,00:33:22.42,00:33:22.42,"Coach, Tyson, and Debbie now if you promise me you will turn on"
556,00:33:25.08,00:33:25.08,them when the time comes. >> I will...
557,00:33:26.92,00:33:26.92,">> All right, we just want to talk."
558,00:33:28.71,00:33:28.71,I just want to ask you guys. >> Yeah.
559,00:33:30.38,00:33:30.38,">> Um, we're doing the beans right now."
560,00:33:32.46,00:33:32.46,>> Right. >> And then we're going to add
561,00:33:33.96,00:33:33.96,a little bit of rice to them. >> Okay.
562,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,">> And then we'll, so, we'll eat, we'll just split it up and"
563,00:33:37.50,00:33:37.50,"then in a couple of hours, we'll split it up again."
564,00:33:39.58,00:33:39.58,Good? >> That's cool.
565,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,>> Okay. >> We're trying to get
566,00:33:43.21,00:33:43.21,"everything straight. >> If it's five, five, we gotta"
567,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,stay... >> I will get Erinn... I will
568,00:33:51.08,00:33:51.08,get Erinn to go to do this. But she's not in on it still.
569,00:33:55.08,00:33:55.08,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> Got it."
570,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,>> What a mess. >> We done with our awkward
571,00:34:06.29,00:34:06.29,"conversations? >> Yeah, man."
572,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,>> Get over here. >> Is Joe back yet?
573,00:34:13.29,00:34:13.29,>> No. >> Is it bad to fish in the
574,00:34:15.54,00:34:15.54,middle of the day in the rain? >> It may be good to fish in
575,00:34:17.96,00:34:17.96,the rain. You all want to try to eat some
576,00:34:19.71,00:34:19.71,"fish before we go? >> Yeah, we got plenty of time."
577,00:34:23.04,00:34:23.04,>> We got plenty of... >> You guys want to go?
578,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,>> Not right now. I'll meet you.
579,00:34:30.04,00:34:30.04,"I'll come down there later. >> I might come down in a bit,"
580,00:34:31.75,00:34:31.75,too. I like it down there.
581,00:34:33.50,00:34:33.50,>> All right. >> There's definitely a
582,00:34:35.29,00:34:35.29,"scenario where I could be in trouble, within Timbira; my old"
583,00:34:38.25,00:34:38.25,Timbira tribe senses something. If it's going on with Stephen
584,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,"and Taj and myself, they might say, ""Let's get rid of Brendan"
585,00:34:43.71,00:34:43.71,"now."" You know, who knows?"
586,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,But so much of it is going to be on the fly.
587,00:34:47.54,00:34:47.54,I'll have the immunity idol in my pocket and I'm not afraid to
588,00:34:50.08,00:34:50.08,play it tonight. >> I feel like Brendan and
589,00:34:55.12,00:34:55.12,Sierra haven't tried to really communicate yet.
590,00:34:57.96,00:34:57.96,>> I know. >> Tonight?
591,00:35:05.58,00:35:05.58,>> Yeah. >> How?
592,00:35:06.62,00:35:06.62,>> I don't think that they're unified.
593,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,"I bet we could sway them. I think we could sway like,"
594,00:35:12.38,00:35:12.38,"Coach, you know, Coach and J.T. are seriously (indistinct)"
595,00:35:15.25,00:35:15.25,"right now, have you noticed that?"
596,00:35:16.58,00:35:16.58,">> Mm-hmm. >> Well, if you can pull it"
597,00:35:18.04,00:35:18.04,"together, I'll do it. >> You will?"
598,00:35:19.88,00:35:19.88,>> Mm-hmm. >> I know how tight you guys
599,00:35:21.21,00:35:21.21,"are. >> I mean, we're cool, but like"
600,00:35:22.75,00:35:22.75,"I said, we've been over here for two days now, and I haven't"
601,00:35:25.92,00:35:25.92,"had the chance to talk to him, and I don't trust him anymore."
602,00:35:28.62,00:35:28.62,"I don't feel secure. If we were even, it would"
603,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,"probably be different, but because he has all the numbers,"
604,00:35:34.21,00:35:34.21,it just doesn't feel good... you know?
605,00:35:37.83,00:35:37.83,">> Taj, your teeth are abnormally white, too."
606,00:35:39.67,00:35:39.67,">> So white. >> I bleach mine, too."
607,00:35:43.04,00:35:43.04,">> I'm obsessed with my teeth. >> I'm, yeah, I'm the same."
608,00:35:47.21,00:35:47.21,>> I knew it when we merged. I said my last hope is to talk
609,00:35:51.08,00:35:51.08,to J.T. >> You can trust me.
610,00:35:52.71,00:35:52.71,"I know I can trust you, man. >> And I know that."
611,00:35:55.21,00:35:55.21,">> Y'all just keep reassuring, you know, me or Joe."
612,00:35:58.42,00:35:58.42,">> Well, it was perfect because you guys went out and talked and"
613,00:36:01.12,00:36:01.12,"we were all in that circle, and I'm not telling any lies."
614,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,>> Okay. >> And they were going to vote
615,00:36:06.04,00:36:06.04,"you, and you're the warrior, and we're together now, man."
616,00:36:09.92,00:36:09.92,">> I'm on top of that, man. >> All right, listen, just don't"
617,00:36:12.29,00:36:12.29,"burn me, okay. >> I won't, man."
618,00:36:14.96,00:36:14.96,>> I just screwed my whole tribe.
619,00:36:16.71,00:36:16.71,">> If I'm reading Coach right, he's telling me the truth."
620,00:36:19.38,00:36:19.38,My life in this game is in his hands tonight.
621,00:36:21.29,00:36:21.29,"But, you know, this is a game for a million dollars."
622,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,They're voting me tonight. >> What?
623,00:36:28.67,00:36:28.67,>> Coach just said Sierra and Brendan are the only two that's
624,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,going to vote me. >> That means...
625,00:36:33.62,00:36:33.62,">> Hopefully, he won't play his idol."
626,00:36:35.79,00:36:35.79,>> He's not going to play his idol.
627,00:36:37.67,00:36:37.67,">> If he does, dude, I'm out. >> You're not going out."
628,00:36:44.88,00:36:44.88,">> I was thinking, if, uh, and Brendan's going to vote me."
629,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83,">> Damn, it's 'cause Joe's injured."
630,00:36:52.04,00:36:52.04,>> That's fine. If Brendan's voting me and
631,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,Sierra's voting me... >> We can split votes.
632,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,>> That's two. >> We can split votes.
633,00:37:02.71,00:37:02.71,"This is awesome. If Brendan plays the idol,"
634,00:37:06.00,00:37:06.00,then it doesn't matter how many of us vote for him.
635,00:37:08.54,00:37:08.54,"One of the Jalapao tribe, whoever he chooses, is going"
636,00:37:11.04,00:37:11.04,home. And it sounds like Brendan is
637,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,"targeting J.T., which is disastrous for me."
638,00:37:16.46,00:37:16.46,"So, our solution is to split the votes."
639,00:37:19.79,00:37:19.79,We have at least four or five solid votes for Brendan.
640,00:37:22.46,00:37:22.46,"The rest of us vote for Sierra. That way, if Brendan does play"
641,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"the idol, Sierra's going home, and Brendan can go home next."
642,00:37:35.75,00:37:35.75,>> J.T. and I were talking about splitting the vote just in case
643,00:37:38.67,00:37:38.67,"he uses his idol. So, four people, five people"
644,00:37:42.54,00:37:42.54,"vote for him, and two or three vote for Sierra."
645,00:37:45.92,00:37:45.92,That way he can't vote J.T. out no matter what.
646,00:37:48.29,00:37:48.29,>> That's true. That's true. Let's do it.
647,00:37:50.21,00:37:50.21,>> Yeah. >> We need to split the vote
648,00:37:54.75,00:37:54.75,"now. We need four on Brendan, three"
649,00:37:57.79,00:37:57.79,"on Sierra, and then Sierra and Brendan's can go anywhere and"
650,00:38:02.58,00:38:02.58,"they don't count for anything. So, whether an idol's played"
651,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,or not. You know?
652,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,>> I gotcha. >> One of them goes.
653,00:38:09.71,00:38:09.71,">> At Tribal tonight, if it goes the way that I planned it to, it"
654,00:38:13.25,00:38:13.25,will absolute shake the hell out of the foundations that
655,00:38:17.46,00:38:17.46,were Timbira. >> Not a thing biting.
656,00:38:28.08,00:38:28.08,>> Really? >> No.
657,00:38:29.50,00:38:29.50,>> Not a thing? >> Nothing.
658,00:38:30.54,00:38:30.54,>> Not the time? >> I have no patience for
659,00:38:32.54,00:38:32.54,sitting around holding a rod in my hand without anything
660,00:38:35.42,00:38:35.42,"working. Did you catch that, Debbie?"
661,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,>> I got it. I heard it.
662,00:38:38.29,00:38:38.29,>> So what do you want to call me?
663,00:38:40.00,00:38:40.00,You want to call me The Orchestrator for
664,00:38:41.42,00:38:41.42,orchestrating a beautiful move at this point in the game that
665,00:38:44.25,00:38:44.25,does two things? Keeps my initial game plan
666,00:38:46.92,00:38:46.92,intact and I don't have to compromise by keeping weak
667,00:38:49.21,00:38:49.21,"people around, and voting out one of the strongest, most"
668,00:38:52.12,00:38:52.12,manipulative and possibly most deceitful players to date.
669,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,Or do you want to call me The Dragonslayer because I'm
670,00:38:58.79,00:38:58.79,cutting the head off of the dragon?
671,00:39:00.67,00:39:00.67,You guys call me whatever you want to because at this point
672,00:39:02.67,00:39:02.67,"in time, I feel brilliant! >> Is that Jeff?"
673,00:39:13.33,00:39:13.33,>> It is. >> Uh-oh.
674,00:39:15.17,00:39:15.17,>> Uh-oh. >> Joe is gone.
675,00:39:16.42,00:39:16.42,">> No. >> You know what, I'm going to"
676,00:39:18.54,00:39:18.54,give him applause for not having an umbrella.
677,00:39:20.42,00:39:20.42,"All right. >> PROBST: Ah, I missed you"
678,00:39:22.04,00:39:22.04,guys. >> You're not with Joe.
679,00:39:24.12,00:39:24.12,">> PROBST: No, Joe's not with me."
680,00:39:27.38,00:39:27.38,"Uh, have an update. You guys left the challenge;"
681,00:39:30.21,00:39:30.21,we kept Joe behind. Medical really wanted to check
682,00:39:32.71,00:39:32.71,out his leg. Everybody knows he's been
683,00:39:34.75,00:39:34.75,battling a pretty decent infection.
684,00:39:37.29,00:39:37.29,"They looked at it, did a thorough assessment."
685,00:39:40.96,00:39:40.96,He can't continue. >> What?!
686,00:39:42.79,00:39:42.79,>> PROBST: They said the risk of him staying longer was too
687,00:39:45.33,00:39:45.33,"serious. >> Aw, jeez."
688,00:39:47.21,00:39:47.21,">> PROBST: That if they left him longer in the game, that this"
689,00:39:49.54,00:39:49.54,could get worse. He didn't want to go.
690,00:39:51.96,00:39:51.96,He asked if he could stay. He asked if he could stay
691,00:39:54.29,00:39:54.29,"another day, but he couldn't stay out here any longer."
692,00:39:57.12,00:39:57.12,So he's going to be evacuated via helicopter.
693,00:39:59.54,00:39:59.54,"He'll be taken to the nearest city, get looked at"
694,00:40:03.21,00:40:03.21,at a hospital. They may do surgery; they're not
695,00:40:05.62,00:40:05.62,"sure, but either way, he'll be taken care of."
696,00:40:08.21,00:40:08.21,So the impact on you guys is no Tribal Council.
697,00:40:12.12,00:40:12.12,">> Ooh! I mean, I don't mean to sound"
698,00:40:14.29,00:40:14.29,so happy. (laughter)
699,00:40:16.54,00:40:16.54,">> PROBST: Good news, bad news. No Tribal Council for you guys."
700,00:40:21.04,00:40:21.04,Nobody getting voted out. Nobody else going home.
701,00:40:23.96,00:40:23.96,>> Can you tell Joe that we love him and miss him?
702,00:40:28.17,00:40:28.17,>> PROBST: Try to stay dry and take care of yourselves.
703,00:40:32.25,00:40:32.25,And the game continues. I'll see you soon.
704,00:40:34.21,00:40:34.21,">> Thanks for coming by. >> PROBST: All right, guys, good"
705,00:40:36.00,00:40:36.00,"night. >> Thanks, bye."
706,00:40:44.75,00:40:44.75,>> Brendan lives to see another day.
707,00:40:46.58,00:40:46.58,I am disappointed. The main thing about getting
708,00:40:50.08,00:40:50.08,the plan to work was keeping everybody quiet for long enough
709,00:40:52.25,00:40:52.25,to vote him out so that he didn't use an idol if he had it.
710,00:40:55.46,00:40:55.46,"Now, I don't know how much is going to leak or what's going"
711,00:40:58.29,00:40:58.29,"to happen, but... >> I can't wait till the next"
712,00:41:05.71,00:41:05.71,Tribal Council even more so now because I have had some plans
713,00:41:08.33,00:41:08.33,"in order and, uh, I think someone on the old Timbira tribe"
714,00:41:12.33,00:41:12.33,"just bought themselves three days, and they don't even know"
715,00:41:14.42,00:41:14.42,"it. >> So, no Tribal tonight."
716,00:41:18.12,00:41:18.12,"That sucks. You know, I mean, it's like,"
717,00:41:20.25,00:41:20.25,we've got a game plan. I'm ready for action.
718,00:41:22.75,00:41:22.75,The Dragonslayer has to wait another day to taste blood.
719,00:41:42.17,00:41:42.17,">> The doctor said that if I... if it got bad, which it would"
720,00:41:45.42,00:41:45.42,"have if I would've stayed, that I, you know, could potentially"
721,00:41:49.12,00:41:49.12,"lose my leg or lose my life. This game is cool, but it's not"
722,00:41:54.88,00:41:54.88,that cool. I-I don't want...
723,00:41:59.12,00:41:59.12,I don't want to die. I'd rather walk home.
