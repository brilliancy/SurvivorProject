233,00:14:38.03,00:14:38.03,I FEEL RESPONSIBLE. IN REDEMPTION I COULD TRADE
234,00:14:40.93,00:14:40.93,PLACES WITH KAT. AND I DIDN'T.
235,00:14:45.87,00:14:45.87,"BUT AT THE TIME YOU THINK, YEAH, IT'S THE BEST DECISION."
236,00:14:48.80,00:14:48.80,BUT AS SOON AS I MADE IT I REGRETTED IT.
237,00:14:51.70,00:14:51.70,"YOU FEEL GUILTY OR RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE, LIKE, KAT IS A LITTLE"
238,00:14:55.40,00:14:55.40,NAIVE SOMETIMES AND DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW WHICH WAY IS UP.
239,00:15:03.90,00:15:03.90,"AND I'M THE ONE THAT, LIKE, HELPS HER."
240,00:15:07.60,00:15:07.60,I WAS IN A POSITION TO HELP HER AND I DIDN'T DO IT WHEN I COULD
241,00:15:12.40,00:15:12.40,"HAVE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M PROUD OF,"
242,00:15:15.07,00:15:15.07,"YOU KNOW? IT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW --"
243,00:15:18.33,00:15:18.33,WE ALL KNOW IT'S JUST A GAME BUT IT'S NOT LIKE -- JUST NOT THAT
244,00:15:22.43,00:15:22.43,EASY. >> I THINK IT'S WAY HARDER THAN
245,00:15:24.47,00:15:24.47,EVERYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.
246,00:15:25.53,00:15:25.53,">> ABSOLUTELY. >> GUYS, WE GOT EACH OTHER."

250,00:15:40.47,00:15:40.47,">> LET'S RUN. >> WITH KAT BEING GONE, YOU FEEL"
251,00:15:43.67,00:15:43.67,A LITTLE RELIEF BECAUSE I CAN PLAY MY GAME.
252,00:15:45.67,00:15:45.67,I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE.
253,00:15:47.50,00:15:47.50,I'M ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR ME NOW. SO I CAN PLAY A LITTLE BIT MORE
254,00:15:51.80,00:15:51.80,"CUTTHROAT IF I HAVE TO. IN FACT, I THINK IT COULD"
255,00:15:55.13,00:15:55.13,STRENGTHEN MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS TRIBE BECAUSE THE MAJORITY
256,00:15:57.40,00:15:57.40,"OF THE TRIBE OVER HERE, THEY DON'T HAVE LOVED ONES AND IT'S"
257,00:16:00.37,00:16:00.37,"KIND OF ONE MORE THING WE ALL HAVE IN COMMON, EXCEPT ARAS."
258,00:16:05.30,00:16:05.30,>> ANYBODY WANT TO GO OUT FOR A PEACEFUL WALK AND MEDITATION?
259,00:16:08.83,00:16:08.83,>> I'M GOING TO TRY AND TAKE A NAP HERE.
260,00:16:11.20,00:16:11.20,">> ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK. >> GOOD LUCK, THOUGH."
261,00:16:19.60,00:16:19.60,>> I COULD HAVEN'T ASKED FOR A BETTER SITUATION WHEN I CAME
262,00:16:22.60,00:16:22.60,"HERE TO HAVE TWO OF THE PEOPLE THAT I WAS REALLY, REALLY TIGHT"
263,00:16:26.27,00:16:26.27,WITH-- SKWRER VAS AND TYSON-- COME ON OVER TO THIS SIDE AND
264,00:16:29.63,00:16:29.63,OBVIOUSLY VYTAS IS MY CORE PARTNER AT THE END OF THE DAY SO
265,00:16:32.40,00:16:32.40,WHEN WE GET BACK TOGETHER I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A DOMINANT POSITION
266,00:16:34.97,00:16:34.97,"IN THE GAME. I JUST NEED TO LET GO, LISTEN,"
267,00:16:38.17,00:16:38.17,BE INTUITIVE AND I'LL BE GUIDED TO THE RIGHT PLACES.
268,00:16:41.10,00:16:41.10,SO EVERYDAY WHEN I MEDITATE I VISUALIZE JEFF'S VOICE SAYING
269,00:16:45.40,00:16:45.40,"""AND THE WINNER OF ""SURVIVOR: BLOOD VS. WATER,"" ARAS."
270,00:16:49.97,00:16:49.97,AND I DO MY BEST TO TRUST THAT I'M TAKEN CARE OF.
271,00:16:54.73,00:16:54.73,>> YOU GUYS READY FOR THIS? >> WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE
272,00:16:58.03,00:16:58.03,MERGE PROBABLY TOMORROW AND I DON'T KNOW WHOSE NAME YOU HEAR
273,00:17:02.23,00:17:02.23,"MOST OUT OF ARAS' MOUTH, MAYBE YOU CAN GUESS?"
274,00:17:05.17,00:17:05.17,>> HIS BROTHER. >> ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS GET TO
275,00:17:08.37,00:17:08.37,"VYTAS, THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME. THEY'VE BEEN THE MOST DANGEROUS"
276,00:17:11.37,00:17:11.37,COUPLE IN THE GAME SINCE DAY ONE AND THEY'RE ONE OF THE ONLY
277,00:17:14.23,00:17:14.23,COUPLES STILL LEFT IN THE GAME. WE HAVE TO TAKE OUT ARAS OR
278,00:17:18.20,00:17:18.20,VYTAS SOONER THAN LATER. >> HIS FINAL FOUR HAS TWO SPOTS
279,00:17:22.03,00:17:22.03,"TAKEN, HIM AND VYTAS. >> MERGE IS GOING TO HAPPEN."
280,00:17:24.83,00:17:24.83,IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SOON. IF WE STICK TOGETHER WE CAN GET
281,00:17:26.97,00:17:26.97,TO THE END NO PROBLEM. AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW I
282,00:17:30.23,00:17:30.23,WILL STICK WITH ALL YOU GUYS TO FINAL FIVE 100% MY WORD.
283,00:17:33.43,00:17:33.43,>> I WAS SHOCKED IT WAS TYSON THAT PROPOSED THE PLAN.
284,00:17:36.20,00:17:36.20,"HE SEEMED VERY CLOSE WITH ARAS BUT ON THE SAME HAND, TYSON'S"
285,00:17:41.70,00:17:41.70,SMART. RIGHT NOW SOMETHING WE HAVE IN
286,00:17:44.23,00:17:44.23,COMMON IS WE KNOW WE CAN TRUST EACH OTHER IS BECAUSE WE DON'T
287,00:17:46.67,00:17:46.67,HAVE ANYONE OVER THERE WE TRUST MORE.
288,00:17:49.23,00:17:49.23,">> IS EVERYBODY COOL WITH THAT, US FIVE AND SMOOTH SAILING?"
289,00:17:51.87,00:17:51.87,>> US FIVE. >> I'M GOOD WITH IT.
290,00:17:53.53,00:17:53.53,>> HAPPY? >> SOLID.
291,00:17:55.20,00:17:55.20,>> HAPPY? >> I'M IN.
292,00:17:56.60,00:17:56.60,>> HAPPY? WE HAVE TO HAVE EACH OTHER'S
293,00:17:58.70,00:17:58.70,BACKS. >> ARE YOU HAPPY?
294,00:17:59.67,00:17:59.67,>> I'M VERY HAPPY. I THOUGHT ARAS WAS PLAYING A
295,00:18:02.80,00:18:02.80,GOOD GAME AT FIRST BUT EVERYONE ELSE IS RECOGNIZING HIS MAIN
296,00:18:06.30,00:18:06.30,MOTIVATION RIGHT NOW WHICH IS GET TO VYTAS AND THEN TAKE
297,00:18:08.90,00:18:08.90,CONTROL OF THE GAME. MEDITATE ALL DAY LONG IF THAT'S
298,00:18:13.20,00:18:13.20,WHAT YOU NEED. I THINK HE'S GETTING COMFORTABLE
299,00:18:15.63,00:18:15.63,AND THAT PLAYS RIGHT INTO MY GAME PLAN.
300,00:18:32.93,00:18:32.93,"MORNING, BOO. >> GOOD MORNING, PRINCESS."
301,00:18:36.03,00:18:36.03,">> GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TOO. >> JUST LITTLE LATE"
302,00:18:44.67,00:18:44.67,SLEEPER-INNERS. HOW DID YOU SLEEP?
303,00:18:45.63,00:18:45.63,">> I SLEPT GREAT. OH, MY GOD, I WAS SO -- JUST"
304,00:18:48.80,00:18:48.80,"TIRED, YOU KNOW? >> EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT PART OF"
305,00:18:52.03,00:18:52.03,OUR ALLIANCE I'VE REALLY COME TO LIKE VYTAS.
306,00:18:54.97,00:18:54.97,HE'S BEEN THROUGH THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS AND LOTS OF TIMES
307,00:18:58.17,00:18:58.17,WHEN PEOPLE GET KNOCKED DOWN AND THEY PICK THEMSELVES BACK UP
308,00:19:01.30,00:19:01.30,THEY'RE A WHOLE NEW PERSON. >> YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE A LITTLE
309,00:19:06.03,00:19:06.03,HAPPY COUPLE CAMPING ON THE BEACH.
310,00:19:07.23,00:19:07.23,>> I WOULD BE HONORED IF HE TOOK AN INTEREST IN KATIE JUST
311,00:19:10.50,00:19:10.50,BECAUSE HE SEEMS LIKE SUCH A STRAIGHT-UP GUY.
312,00:19:12.93,00:19:12.93,"HOWEVER, THE GUY WHO GETS KATIE IS GONNA HAVE TO HIT HER OVER"
313,00:19:15.70,00:19:15.70,THE HEAD WITH A CLUB AND DRAG HER INTO HIS CAVE BECAUSE KATIE
314,00:19:18.77,00:19:18.77,IS NOT A VERY FLIRTATIOUS GIRL. BUT ONE CAN DREAM.
315,00:19:24.27,00:19:24.27,I'M READY FOR GRANDBABIES. (LAUGHS)
316,00:19:27.17,00:19:27.17,WHAT IS THE HARDEST ASPECT OF THIS GAME FOR YOU?
317,00:19:30.53,00:19:30.53,">> OH, THAT'S EASY. THE DISHONESTY."
318,00:19:34.53,00:19:34.53,THE TRIBE SWAP WAS TOUGH. LIKE BEING THE ONE GUY WITH A
319,00:19:37.17,00:19:37.17,BUNCH OF GIRLS. BUT YOGA HAS TAUGHT ME A LOT
320,00:19:39.77,00:19:39.77,ABOUT DEALING WITH THE FEMININE ENERGY AND GIRLS AND WOMEN.
321,00:19:42.53,00:19:42.53,SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT'S GONNA HELP
322,00:19:46.77,00:19:46.77,INGRATIATE ME THE TRIBE MORE. I'M SUCH A TRUSTING PERSON.
323,00:19:49.70,00:19:49.70,"I HAD THIS WOMAN WALK INTO MY YOGA CLASS BARELY EVEN KNEW,"
324,00:19:53.33,00:19:53.33,"I'VE SEEN HER A FEW TIMES, SHE ASKED ME TO BORROW A HUNDRED"
325,00:19:56.33,00:19:56.33,BUCKS. I WAS TAKEN ABACK THAT SHE HAD
326,00:19:58.53,00:19:58.53,"THE AUDACITY BUT THEN I THOUGHT THIS MOMENT OF PRINCIPLE, LIKE I"
327,00:20:01.90,00:20:01.90,WANT TO BE T WORLD TO BE A PLACE WHERE WE CAN JUST TRUST FIRST
328,00:20:05.13,00:20:05.13,"AND THEN IF SOMEBODY BREAKS IT, THEN YOU DON'T TRUST THEM."
329,00:20:07.93,00:20:07.93,"SO I GAVE HER THE HUNDRED BUCKS. I WAS LIKE, SURE."
330,00:20:11.27,00:20:11.27,"IN MY EXPERIENCE, WOMEN LOVE A BAD BOY, BUT WHAT THEY EVEN LIKE"
331,00:20:14.80,00:20:14.80,MORE THAN A BAD BOY IS A NEWLY REFORMED BAD BOY.
332,00:20:19.40,00:20:19.40,SO I'M PUTTING FORWARD THE PARTS OF ME THAT I WANT THESE WOMEN TO
333,00:20:22.70,00:20:22.70,"SEE. I AM A LIKABLE PERSON, I'M A"
334,00:20:25.83,00:20:25.83,TRUSTWORTHY GUY. IT'S ALL VERY CALCULATED.
335,00:20:29.07,00:20:29.07,BUT IT'S WORKING. >> WE'RE SO GLAD YOU ARE HERE.
336,00:20:32.90,00:20:32.90,">> ME, TOO. >> VYTAS, HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN"
337,00:20:36.13,00:20:36.13,THAT CAN SHARE HIS EMOTIONS AND HIS FEELINGS AND I'VE LEARNED A
338,00:20:39.53,00:20:39.53,LOT FROM VYTAS. JUST BEING MORE OPEN TO PEOPLE.
339,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,I'M FEELING LESS GUARDED WITH THIS SMALL OF A TRIBE AND I FEEL
340,00:20:47.50,00:20:47.50,"LIKE I CAN BE MYSELF. COMING INTO THIS GAME, ONE OF MY"
341,00:20:51.00,00:20:51.00,INSECURITIES HAS BEEN MY SOCIAL GAME.
342,00:20:52.37,00:20:52.37,I WAS RAISED ON A FARM AND I'M KIND OF A QUIET GIRL THAT'S
343,00:20:56.70,00:20:56.70,SLOWLY COMING OUT OF MICHELLE. AND I'M BECOMING MORE AT PEACE
344,00:20:59.77,00:20:59.77,WITH WHERE I AM IN THE GAME. I AM SO GRATEFUL.
345,00:21:04.67,00:21:04.67,I'VE HAD A GREAT TIME. I'M REALLY TRYING TO ENJOY EVERY
346,00:21:08.30,00:21:08.30,MOMENT. SO THAT'S WHY I LOVE VYTAS.
347,00:21:10.97,00:21:10.97,BUT I HAVE TO KEEP MY HEART OUT OF IT BECAUSE HE IS A THREAT AND
348,00:21:14.20,00:21:14.20,I'M WILLING TO STICK WITH THE GIRLS IF THAT IS WHAT THE
349,00:21:17.50,00:21:17.50,CONSENSUS IS. I WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
350,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,TO FURTHER MY GAME. >> YAY!
351,00:21:36.50,00:21:36.50,>> LET'S READ IT. >> CHAINED TO A FAMILY NOT OF
352,00:21:40.30,00:21:40.30,YOUR CHOOSING MAY MAKE YOU A VICTIM OF FATE.
353,00:21:43.97,00:21:43.97,APATHY OR FATIGUE MAY LEAD TO YOUR LOSING AND TRIBAL COUNCIL
354,00:21:47.00,00:21:47.00,IS WHERE YOUR CHANGES ABATE. >> WE'RE ALL CHAINED TOGETHER
355,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,DOING SOMETHING. >> WOW!
356,00:21:52.23,00:21:52.23,>> GOING INTO A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE WITH TWO WOMEN IN

358,00:21:59.50,00:21:59.50,STRONG DUDES AND A GIRL IS TOUGH.
359,00:22:01.10,00:22:01.10,WE'RE GOING TO BE UNDERDOGS NO MATTER HOW THE COOKIE CRUMBLES
360,00:22:04.03,00:22:04.03,IN THIS CASE. I'M NOT GETTING MY HOPES TOO
361,00:22:08.30,00:22:08.30,HIGH. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK IF WE LOSE?
362,00:22:11.10,00:22:11.10,>> THEN IT'S GOING TO BE VYTAS. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE THE
363,00:22:16.43,00:22:16.43,BEGINNING. ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

547,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,BUT THIS GAME IS BUILT ON TRUST. >> WE GOT RID OF KAT BECAUSE SHE
548,00:33:19.83,00:33:19.83,WAS DOING THAT. >> THE PLAN WAS TO VOTE OUT
549,00:33:24.43,00:33:24.43,VYTAS. WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE NUT
550,00:33:26.20,00:33:26.20,"CRACKING, SO TO SPEAK, WHAT WE SAY IN THE HILLS."
551,00:33:28.60,00:33:28.60,AND HE'S THE THREAT. JUST BECAUSE EVERYBODY SEEMS TO
552,00:33:33.27,00:33:33.27,LIKE HIM. HOWEVER LAURA B. IS
553,00:33:37.13,00:33:37.13,UNPREDICTABLE AND THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.
554,00:33:41.37,00:33:41.37,>> IS IT MY TIME TO GO TONIGHT? >> I DON'T THINK SO.
555,00:33:45.13,00:33:45.13,I THINK IT COULD BE LAURA B. >> THANK YOU.
556,00:33:48.60,00:33:48.60,I APPRECIATE THAT. I TRUST YOU GIRLS 100%.
557,00:33:53.07,00:33:53.07,WHEN LAURA B. TOLD ME IT WAS MY TIME TO GO TONIGHT FOR A MOMENT
558,00:33:56.23,00:33:56.23,"I WAS LIKE ""I'M SCREWED."" BUT TINA, SHE WAS TELLING ME"
559,00:33:59.70,00:33:59.70,THAT LAURA'S GOING HOME. IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE
560,00:34:04.20,00:34:04.20,EMBARRASSING FOR HER. >> IT WOULD BE SUPER EASY FOR
561,00:34:06.33,00:34:06.33,THEM TO WRITE MY NAME DOWN ON THE PARCHMENT BUT I FEEL LIKE
562,00:34:09.43,00:34:09.43,I'VE DONE MY DUE DILIGENCE WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING TRUST WITH
563,00:34:12.17,00:34:12.17,THESE WOMEN SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE ME TONIGHT.
564,00:34:14.97,00:34:14.97,>> I SHOULD TKPWOPBLT OFF WITH ANY OF YOU BECAUSE THEN SHE'LL
565,00:34:17.73,00:34:17.73,"BE LIKE ""WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO VYTAS?"""
566,00:34:20.40,00:34:20.40,AND IF SHE DOES ASK YOU JUST LIKE SAY HE WAS SAYING HIS
567,00:34:24.93,00:34:24.93,GOOD-BYE. IT'S LIKE A PRIDE ALLIANCE
568,00:34:27.20,00:34:27.20,FEMALES IN CONTROL BUT THEY ALWAYS NEED ONE ALPHA MALE TO
569,00:34:30.87,00:34:30.87,KEEP AROUND OTHERWISE THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR THE PRIDE.
570,00:34:33.03,00:34:33.03,>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THAT'S MY BIG DILEMMA.
571,00:34:39.13,00:34:39.13,THERE'S PREPAR CUSHIONS BOTH WAYS.
572,00:34:42.63,00:34:42.63,TONIGHT. >> TONIGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE A
573,00:34:43.87,00:34:43.87,TOUGH DECISION. IN MY HEAD I THINK IT'S SMART IF
574,00:34:45.87,00:34:45.87,WE GET RID OF VYTAS BECAUSE AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO THINK
575,00:34:48.67,00:34:48.67,LONG TERM AND IF HE MAKES IT TO THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL IT
576,00:34:51.60,00:34:51.60,WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO BEAT HIM. >> OF COURSE THERE'S A LITTLE
577,00:34:57.33,00:34:57.33,FEAR BUT I TRUST YOU GUYS. >> YEAH.
578,00:34:59.63,00:34:59.63,"AT THE SAME TIME, LAURA B. IS THE WILD CARD."
579,00:35:02.03,00:35:02.03,SHE MAKES THESE DECISIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING ANYONE AND TO
580,00:35:05.67,00:35:05.67,"KEEP SOMEONE LIKE THAT, THAT COULD HIT THE FAN AND EXPLODE"
581,00:35:08.30,00:35:08.30,BACK IN MY FACE. >> THANK YOU FOR LAURA B. AND
582,00:35:11.93,00:35:11.93,HER STRENGTH AS A NEW PERSON AND HAVING SO MANY LESSONS TO LEARN
583,00:35:15.30,00:35:15.30,AND THANK YOU FOR VYTAS' WONDERFUL SPIRIT WHO BRINGS SO
584,00:35:20.40,00:35:20.40,MUCH TO THIS CAMP AS WELL. >> SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
585,00:35:23.40,00:35:23.40,HAPPEN BUT WHATEVER GOES DOWN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY.
586,00:35:49.27,00:35:49.27,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, SO  LAURA"
587,00:35:51.07,00:35:51.07,B. AFTER THE CHALLENGE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU GOT BACK TO
588,00:35:55.67,00:35:55.67,"CAMP? >> WELL, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WE"
589,00:35:57.27,00:35:57.27,ARE FOUR GIRLS AND VYTAS ONE MAN SO I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO LET
590,00:36:01.90,00:36:01.90,HIM KNOW THAT HE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS GOING HOME.
591,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,">> Jeff: WOW. VYTAS, SO WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?"
592,00:36:09.07,00:36:09.07,"SOMEBODY TELLS YOU ""IT'S YOU""? >> IT WAS DISCOURAGING TO SAY"
593,00:36:12.43,00:36:12.43,THE LEAST. I'VE COME INTO THIS TRIBE AND
594,00:36:15.07,00:36:15.07,I'VE BEEN NOTHING BUT TRUSTWORTHY AND I'VE BEEN
595,00:36:17.67,00:36:17.67,"GENUINE WITH THESE PEOPLE. TO GET THAT KIND OF NEWS, IT"
596,00:36:20.17,00:36:20.17,"DIDN'T FEEL GOOD. >> Jeff: MONICA, TELLING"
597,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING HOME AS PLEASANT AS IT SOUNDS IS REALLY
598,00:36:25.97,00:36:25.97,RISKY. >> I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY RISKY.
599,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,SO IF YOU'RE IN AN ALLIANCE WITH PEOPLE BEFORE YOU BLOW THE COVER
600,00:36:34.80,00:36:34.80,WE MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT FIRST.
601,00:36:36.63,00:36:36.63,">> Jeff: KATIE, WHERE DO YOU WEIGH IN ON THAT?"
602,00:36:38.80,00:36:38.80,BECAUSE LAURA B. IS SPEAKING FOR THE GROUP WHICH COULD
603,00:36:42.00,00:36:42.00,POTENTIALLY IMPACT YOU. >> I AGREE WITH MONICA.
604,00:36:44.50,00:36:44.50,IF YOU'RE IN AN ALLIANCE YOU SHOULD DISCUSS THESE THINGS SO
605,00:36:47.90,00:36:47.90,WE WERE TAKEN AWACK. I WISH WE COULD HAVE TALKED
606,00:36:50.37,00:36:50.37,"ABOUT IT BEFORE. >> Jeff: VYTAS, IT SEEMS LIKE"
607,00:36:55.10,00:36:55.10,WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO YOU'RE GOING UNLESS YOU CAN CONVINCE
608,00:36:57.57,00:36:57.57,THESE WOMEN THAT SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD GO AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
609,00:37:00.70,00:37:00.70,THAT COULD BE LAURA B. BECAUSE SHE SPOKE UP TRYING TO DO THE
610,00:37:04.20,00:37:04.20,HONORABLE THING IN A GAME THAT IS ANYTHING BUT HONORABLE.
611,00:37:06.40,00:37:06.40,">> YOU KNOW, THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL KAT WENT HOME BECAUSE"
612,00:37:09.40,00:37:09.40,"SHE WASN'T TRUSTWORTHY. I MEAN, I DIDN'T PITCH ANYBODY"
613,00:37:13.63,00:37:13.63,SPECIFICALLY. I'VE BEEN A GREAT MEMBER OF
614,00:37:15.70,00:37:15.70,"GALANG AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY GIRLS YOU HAVE, IT MATTERS"
615,00:37:18.53,00:37:18.53,HOW MANY TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE YOU HAVE.
616,00:37:20.13,00:37:20.13,">> Jeff: TINA, IT'S A DECENT ARGUMENT FROM A GUY WHO HAS"
617,00:37:23.07,00:37:23.07,NOTHING TO LOSE BECAUSE HE'S ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT.
618,00:37:26.73,00:37:26.73,>> IT'S TRUE AND VYTAS IS SO MUCH LIKE HIS BROTHER.
619,00:37:31.70,00:37:31.70,"THEIR HONESTY AND SINCERITY, THEY REEK OF IT."
620,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,"NOW, COULD THEY BE FOOLING YOU? ABSOLUTELY."
621,00:37:36.90,00:37:36.90,"THIS IS ""SURVIVOR."" BUT IF YOU WERE GOING ON"
622,00:37:40.50,00:37:40.50,"INSTINCT, THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD FEEL."
623,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,">> Jeff: VYTAS, IF IT'S YOU TONIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR STORY?"
624,00:37:47.37,00:37:47.37,">> I MEAN, I WAS IN A POSITION WHERE I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO"
625,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,"MOVE FORWARD REALLY WELL, THEN THERE WAS A TRIBE SWAP, I WAS"
626,00:37:52.90,00:37:52.90,THE ONE GUY WITH FIVE GIRLS AND IF I GO TONIGHT IT'S UNFORTUNATE
627,00:37:56.57,00:37:56.57,BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER PRETTY WELL.
628,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,THAT WOULD BE MY STORY. >> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK
629,00:38:00.93,00:38:00.93,YOUR BROTHER WILL THINK? WILL HE BE PROUD OF YOU OR HAPPY
630,00:38:04.83,00:38:04.83,YOU'RE GONE? >> I THINK ARAS WOULD BE PROUD
631,00:38:07.10,00:38:07.10,OF ME AND I THINK ARAS WOULD BE PRETTY BUMMED I'M GONE.
632,00:38:10.67,00:38:10.67,OUR RELATIONSHIP HAS SUFFERED OVER THE YEARS AND THERE'S A FEW
633,00:38:14.07,00:38:14.07,MORE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO GROW THAT MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER.
634,00:38:17.73,00:38:17.73,">> Jeff: LAURA B. IS, THAT PART OF VYTAS' APPEAL THAT HE"
635,00:38:21.27,00:38:21.27,AND HIS BROTHER HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE STORY?

637,00:38:26.60,00:38:26.60,VYTAS BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SUCH A BOND.
638,00:38:29.23,00:38:29.23,ARAS HAS WON BEFORE. THEY'RE A HUGE THREAT IN THIS
639,00:38:32.03,00:38:32.03,"GAME. >> Jeff: WHAT ABOUT YOU,"
640,00:38:33.27,00:38:33.27,"LAURA? IF IT'S YOU TONIGHT, WHAT'S YOUR"

643,00:38:41.10,00:38:41.10,>> Jeff: SO THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE LEARNING OUT HERE?
644,00:38:42.97,00:38:42.97,>> YES. I WAS RAISED IN A QUIET FAMILY
645,00:38:45.13,00:38:45.13,AND KEEP TO YOURSELF SO I STRUGGLE WITH LETTING PEOPLE
646,00:38:49.23,00:38:49.23,KNOW WHO I AM AND IT'S BEEN HARD FOR ME.
647,00:38:51.50,00:38:51.50,>> Jeff: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR HUSBAND RUPERT WILL MAKE OF
648,00:38:54.27,00:38:54.27,THE WAY YOU PLAYED THE GAME? >> I THINK NO MATTER WHAT RUPERT
649,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03,WOULD BE PROUD OF ME. I'VE BEEN IN RUPERT'S SHADOW FOR
650,00:39:00.90,00:39:00.90,A WHILE AND IT FEELS GOOD JUST TO BE OUT HERE FOR MYSELF AND I
651,00:39:03.83,00:39:03.83,FEEL LIKE I'M COMING INTO MY OWN AND IT FEELS GOOD.
652,00:39:08.23,00:39:08.23,">> Jeff: TINA, TOUGH DECISION. YOU HAVE VYTAS WHO'S TELLING YOU"

658,00:39:25.73,00:39:25.73,I DO LIKE HEARING THE STORIES. THAT'S PART OF THE JOY THAT I

663,00:39:39.67,00:39:39.67,IS THE LEAST TRUSTWORTHY. WE SHOULD BE JUDGED ON OUR

665,00:39:45.10,00:39:45.10,THESE LAST 18 DAYS SO FAR. THAT'S IT.
