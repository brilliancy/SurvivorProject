12,00:00:27.27,00:00:27.27,I'm 40 years old. I've built houses for 20 years.

42,00:03:35.13,00:03:35.13,"meant, like, torrential downpours that flood your whole"

44,00:03:41.97,00:03:41.97,thought? You can actually see it flowing
45,00:03:44.87,00:03:44.87,through the studs of the house. >> AMBER: We have constructed a
46,00:03:49.00,00:03:49.00,shelter that is pretty unbelievable.
47,00:03:51.27,00:03:51.27,We used everything possible that we got from our reward.
48,00:03:54.63,00:03:54.63,"We put the parachute as a wall, we have the tarp on top."
49,00:04:04.10,00:04:04.10,>> ROB M.: The shelter held up pretty good.

51,00:04:09.00,00:04:09.00,It ended up coming up through the floor.
52,00:04:10.73,00:04:10.73,We weren't really predicting for that to happen.

54,00:04:18.00,00:04:18.00,"the blanket. I was warm, and I just slept the"
55,00:04:21.47,00:04:21.47,whole night. >> AMBER: You're so warm.
56,00:04:39.40,00:04:39.40,>> TOM: Rob and Amber were laying on the thing kind of
57,00:04:42.73,00:04:42.73,getting a romantic mood. Maybe the rain was just an
58,00:04:46.97,00:04:46.97,excuse to maybe snuggle a little closer.
59,00:04:51.67,00:04:51.67,>> ROB C.: Boston Rob and Amber are going to do it.
60,00:04:55.10,00:04:55.10,"I don't know when, but they're going to do it."

62,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"Everything is in place, and I really wish those two the best"
63,00:05:03.67,00:05:03.67,of luck. >> RUPERT: Our beach is
64,00:05:34.47,00:05:34.47,"destroyed, that stupid shelter that I built is destroyed."
65,00:05:39.20,00:05:39.20,Digging into the sand is the dumbest idea I've ever had in my
66,00:05:43.30,00:05:43.30,life. And we paid dearly tonight for
67,00:05:46.87,00:05:46.87,"it. It's now underwater, and we are"
68,00:05:51.03,00:05:51.03,homeless. And I got to build us another
69,00:05:56.63,00:05:56.63,"shelter today, something today. >> JERRI: We've been shivering"
70,00:06:09.37,00:06:09.37,"in the rain probably five or six hours, if not more."
71,00:06:18.87,00:06:18.87,"It's a disaster. The rain just started pouring,"
72,00:06:23.67,00:06:23.67,and the whole shelter filled up with water.
73,00:06:27.40,00:06:27.40,The entire thing. The hole that Rupert thought was
74,00:06:32.97,00:06:32.97,"so brilliant to dig, filled up with water."
75,00:06:36.97,00:06:36.97,This never would have happened if they hadn't dug that hole.
76,00:06:42.07,00:06:42.07,(sobbing): It's not worth it. >> RUPERT: That storm was
77,00:07:18.90,00:07:18.90,"insanely hard. It was rough this morning, it"
78,00:07:22.97,00:07:22.97,was rough last night. >> ETHAN: Other than the time
79,00:07:30.03,00:07:30.03,"father passed away, I think that was the worst night of my life."
80,00:07:34.37,00:07:34.37,Hands down. It was horrible.
81,00:07:36.20,00:07:36.20,Some of us thought people were going to come and rescue us.
82,00:07:39.47,00:07:39.47,"I'm like, ""They're not going to rescue us."
83,00:07:40.87,00:07:40.87,"What are you, nuts?"" I'm like, ""This is Survivor."""
84,00:07:42.87,00:07:42.87,It's our own fault this we built a crappy old shelter.
85,00:07:46.40,00:07:46.40,>> JENNA L.: It's not raining at out there.
86,00:07:49.43,00:07:49.43,Come on. You have to start warming up.
87,00:07:53.53,00:07:53.53,I promise you it's warmer out here.
88,00:07:55.50,00:07:55.50,I'm in a bathing suit. It's dripping and wet in here.

92,00:08:17.90,00:08:17.90,"doing with it. As far as I'm concerned, I"
93,00:08:20.90,00:08:20.90,couldn't give a rat's ass at this point.
94,00:08:22.97,00:08:22.97,I don't even care. >> RUPERT: You want any?
95,00:08:26.83,00:08:26.83,>> JENNA L.: Drink some. Come on.
96,00:08:28.70,00:08:28.70,It's good for you. >> RUPERT: It is good for you.
97,00:08:32.27,00:08:32.27,If Jerri warms up and feels better and soaks a little of
98,00:08:35.57,00:08:35.57,"daylight in her, she'll be fine, too."
99,00:08:38.80,00:08:38.80,"But the plan today is, we got to make shelter, we got to make"
100,00:08:42.40,00:08:42.40,"fire, and we got to get it together now."

111,00:09:25.57,00:09:25.57,"When we woke up, the fire was gone, but we got our flint out,"

187,00:13:20.37,00:13:20.37,see you guys are in a good mood. Should make for a fun challenge.
188,00:13:22.47,00:13:22.47,"We thought for today's reward challenge, we would give you a"
189,00:13:26.07,00:13:26.07,chance to finally interact while testing your memory skills.
190,00:13:29.37,00:13:29.37,Here's how it's going to work: each tribe member will have
191,00:13:31.47,00:13:31.47,their own station. Inside each station are four
192,00:13:33.93,00:13:33.93,items relating to island living. Your goal is to find another
193,00:13:38.00,00:13:38.00,tribe member who has a matching item.
194,00:13:40.47,00:13:40.47,"Every time you get a match, you score a point for your tribe."
195,00:13:43.67,00:13:43.67,You can match an item with somebody from your own tribe.
196,00:13:46.07,00:13:46.07,You can match an item with somebody from another tribe.
197,00:13:48.10,00:13:48.10,"Doesn't matter. When you find a match, you score"
198,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,a point. The tribe who scores the most
199,00:13:52.47,00:13:52.47,correct matches wins reward. One more thing: you let somebody
200,00:13:56.00,00:13:56.00,"peek inside your container, it's your problem."
201,00:13:57.57,00:13:57.57,Want to know what your playing for?
202,00:13:59.07,00:13:59.07,>> Of course. >> JEFF: It is a Survivor

211,00:14:21.50,00:14:21.50,"to get good and clean, smell good again."
212,00:14:23.37,00:14:23.37,"In addition, first place and second place get another clue"
213,00:14:25.47,00:14:25.47,"to their lock box. In the lock box, rice."
214,00:14:28.77,00:14:28.77,"So that means for Mogo Mogo and Chapera, this would be your"
215,00:14:32.33,00:14:32.33,"final clue, which means you could theoretically have rice"
216,00:14:34.57,00:14:34.57,"tonight. Chapera, you have to two extra"
217,00:14:36.60,00:14:36.60,members. You're sitting two people out.
218,00:14:38.40,00:14:38.40,Who's sitting out? >> SUE: Me.

221,00:14:43.13,00:14:43.13,member. Who's sitting out?
222,00:14:44.27,00:14:44.27,">> COLBY: I'll sit out, Jeff. >> JEFF: Donaldson's sitting"
223,00:14:45.80,00:14:45.80,out. Take a spot on the bench.
224,00:14:47.03,00:14:47.03,"Everybody else, take a spot behind one of your stations."
225,00:14:48.97,00:14:48.97,"Wait for my go. Okay, we randomly drew numbers"
226,00:14:55.33,00:14:55.33,to decide who would go first. Chapera won.
227,00:14:57.57,00:14:57.57,"Mariano, you're up first. >> ROB M.: Pretty boy."

337,00:19:54.80,00:19:54.80,his head. I'm willing to bet it's not the
338,00:19:57.63,00:19:57.63,first time Big Tom's had his head in the toilet.

365,00:21:26.20,00:21:26.20,The search for the key turned out more like the search for the

554,00:30:40.67,00:30:40.67,">> COLBY: Yeah, baby, yeah! >> KATHY: Oh, that was so great,"
555,00:30:45.23,00:30:45.23,you guys. >> JERRI: I can't believe we
556,00:30:47.20,00:30:47.20,"got all the pieces first. >> JEFF: Saboga, some tough"
557,00:30:50.80,00:30:50.80,"days, but a break tonight-- no Tribal Council."
558,00:30:54.73,00:30:54.73,">> JERRI: Hello, lady. >> JEFF: Mogo Mogo, once again"
559,00:31:01.50,00:31:01.50,immunity. >> LEX: On three.
560,00:31:03.90,00:31:03.90,"One, two, three... >> ALL: Mogo Mogo!"
561,00:31:06.47,00:31:06.47,">> JEFF: Chapera, first time in Tribal Council, first member to"
562,00:31:09.17,00:31:09.17,be voted out of the tribe tonight.
563,00:31:10.63,00:31:10.63,You have the afternoon to think about who that's going to be.
564,00:31:13.20,00:31:13.20,"Head back to camp. >> AMBER: Yeah, it was so"
565,00:31:26.90,00:31:26.90,frustrating to watch. It was so frustrating to watch.
566,00:31:29.07,00:31:29.07,">> SUE: It's like, okay, we want brown with pink circle."
567,00:31:31.33,00:31:31.33,>> AMBER: And then you think you were getting somewhere and
568,00:31:33.70,00:31:33.70,then all of a sudden you had to start all over again.
569,00:31:35.83,00:31:35.83,">> SUE: Oh, it was so bad. >> ROB M.: Always a way."
570,00:31:38.23,00:31:38.23,"You can't just have, like, a really good day all day long."
571,00:31:41.93,00:31:41.93,Today was our first immunity loss.
572,00:31:43.57,00:31:43.57,"I mean, this is the first time we've got to go to Tribal"
573,00:31:46.30,00:31:46.30,"Council. It's day 12, and we just got to"
574,00:31:48.90,00:31:48.90,really start playing the game now.
575,00:31:51.30,00:31:51.30,>> ROB C.: I felt so bad for you guys when you were taking all
576,00:31:54.63,00:31:54.63,"those body shots. >> ROB M.: A tough challenge,"
577,00:31:57.40,00:31:57.40,man. ROB C.: Today's challenge was
578,00:31:59.83,00:31:59.83,"especially frustrating. I think that, with the crew that"
579,00:32:03.63,00:32:03.63,"we had in there, that was not our best puzzle-building team."
580,00:32:07.73,00:32:07.73,"And I think if I was in there, maybe we could have won."
581,00:32:11.00,00:32:11.00,I hope the lesson learned here is that my tribe needs me.
582,00:32:33.53,00:32:33.53,>> TOM: I smell you. I can't see if we were
583,00:32:38.17,00:32:38.17,"to vote Rob C. off tonight, that would make us the strongest"
584,00:32:42.13,00:32:42.13,"team. Honestly, I think Rob C. would"
585,00:32:44.70,00:32:44.70,have been an asset to this challenge because we got beat
586,00:32:48.10,00:32:48.10,"putting the puzzle together, and I do know that his mind would"
587,00:32:51.93,00:32:51.93,have worked that puzzle. I think Rob C's brain is better
588,00:32:56.37,00:32:56.37,than Alicia's. That's the question we've got to
589,00:32:59.27,00:32:59.27,"ask ourselves, you know, where are we the strongest?"
590,00:33:02.70,00:33:02.70,>> ROB C.: You want a piece? It's not that great.
591,00:33:05.03,00:33:05.03,">> ALICIA: No, thank you, babe. >> SUE: Oh, man."
592,00:33:07.33,00:33:07.33,>> ALICIA: I love Rob Cesternino.
593,00:33:08.90,00:33:08.90,He's a great guy. I sense that the past couple of
594,00:33:11.27,00:33:11.27,"days, though, he's known that his head may be on the chopping"
595,00:33:15.70,00:33:15.70,block. Nobody's really talking about it
596,00:33:19.20,00:33:19.20,"a lot, though, which is interesting."
597,00:33:21.07,00:33:21.07,"Usually people rally-- especially, this is the first"
598,00:33:23.43,00:33:23.43,Tribal Council-- just to make sure we're all on the same page.
599,00:33:26.50,00:33:26.50,I haven't heard one thing. That makes me a little nervous.
600,00:33:32.87,00:33:32.87,>> ROB M.: I know you know how to play the game.
601,00:33:35.03,00:33:35.03,>> ROB C.: Mm-hmm. >> ROB M.: And I know you know a
602,00:33:37.27,00:33:37.27,"lot. I know you'll be very, like,"
603,00:33:38.83,00:33:38.83,"helpful, and we can make good allies."
604,00:33:40.53,00:33:40.53,>> ROB C.: I... I agree. Would you be open to considering
605,00:33:44.40,00:33:44.40,getting rid of Alicia before Sue?
606,00:33:46.63,00:33:46.63,>> ROB M.: So you want to get rid of Alicia and then...
607,00:33:51.73,00:33:51.73,Sue? >> ROB C.: Yeah.
608,00:33:53.43,00:33:53.43,">> ROB M.: Me, you, and I think Amber can-can do it."
609,00:33:56.13,00:33:56.13,">> ROB C.: I do get nervous, and I do get paranoid in this game,"
610,00:33:59.47,00:33:59.47,but... >> ROB M.: With cause.
611,00:34:00.57,00:34:00.57,">> ROB C.: ...as long as I have your-your assurance on this,"
612,00:34:02.73,00:34:02.73,then I'm good. >> ROB M.: Mm. Want to shake on
613,00:34:04.13,00:34:04.13,it? >> ROB C.: I made an alliance
614,00:34:08.97,00:34:08.97,"with Boston Rob, and he says that the alliance is me, him and"
615,00:34:12.57,00:34:12.57,Amber. But I don't know how good Boston
616,00:34:15.70,00:34:15.70,"Rob's word is, but I've got his back, and a deal's a deal."
617,00:34:20.53,00:34:20.53,>> ALICIA: You guys almost ready to eat rice?
618,00:34:25.50,00:34:25.50,>> ROB M.: This is good. >> TOM: Yeah.
619,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,>> ROB M.: There's a possibility at this first Tribal Council
620,00:34:30.37,00:34:30.37,that there could be at least one of three people going--
621,00:34:33.13,00:34:33.13,"Cesternino, Sue, or Alicia. I haven't made up my mind yet,"
622,00:34:39.10,00:34:39.10,"but when I do, that's the person that'll be going home."
623,00:35:04.90,00:35:04.90,>> JEFF: Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame.
624,00:35:07.77,00:35:07.77,You're going to dip your torch in and get fire.
625,00:35:09.77,00:35:09.77,"This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council, because as you"
626,00:35:13.23,00:35:13.23,"all know, fire represents life on the island and this game."
627,00:35:19.03,00:35:19.03,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
628,00:35:20.70,00:35:20.70,"When your fire's gone, so are you."
629,00:35:30.70,00:35:30.70,First time for Chapera at Tribal Council.
630,00:35:33.13,00:35:33.13,So let's talk about the first 12 days.
631,00:35:35.43,00:35:35.43,Big Tom? Is this tougher physically?
632,00:35:37.63,00:35:37.63,>> TOM: Physically it's pretty tough.
633,00:35:39.93,00:35:39.93,"All the challenges so far, I've had to suck it up."
634,00:35:43.30,00:35:43.30,"But when you go all out, as this tribe has done, every challenge,"
635,00:35:47.73,00:35:47.73,"it'll get to you. >> JEFF: Rob, how does this"
636,00:35:52.40,00:35:52.40,"compare physically? >> ROB C.: Physically, no doubt,"
637,00:35:55.23,00:35:55.23,this game is much harder than the other games that-that we've
638,00:35:58.70,00:35:58.70,"played, but that's what we signed up for."
639,00:36:00.97,00:36:00.97,"This is All-Star. >> JEFF: Amber, is there"
640,00:36:03.13,00:36:03.13,anything in your normal life that you notice you're now able
641,00:36:06.20,00:36:06.20,to contribute out here? >> AMBER: I think I'm very good
642,00:36:08.87,00:36:08.87,"at controlling my temper and not losing it, and I think we have a"
643,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,few in our tribe who tend to lose their temper pretty quickly
644,00:36:14.60,00:36:14.60,or throw fits. And I think I'm very good at
645,00:36:17.07,00:36:17.07,calming people down and talking some sense into them.
646,00:36:20.17,00:36:20.17,>> JEFF: Who does lose their temper?
647,00:36:21.93,00:36:21.93,"( Amber laughs ) >> AMBER: Well, I think, uh,"
648,00:36:24.13,00:36:24.13,Boston Rob and Alicia kind of argue back and forth a little
649,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,bit... >> ALICIA: We only did once.
650,00:36:28.73,00:36:28.73,How many times did we argue? >> ROB M.: Only one time.
651,00:36:31.43,00:36:31.43,We quelled that real-real quickly.
652,00:36:33.13,00:36:33.13,>> ALICIA: Once. We put a kibosh on it.
653,00:36:35.10,00:36:35.10,">> JEFF: Sue, what is the impact of losing this challenge?"
654,00:36:38.03,00:36:38.03,>> SUE: Us losing today actually probably made us more dangerous
655,00:36:40.80,00:36:40.80,for the rest of the challenges. >> JEFF: Because you gave
656,00:36:43.23,00:36:43.23,yourselves a wake-up call? >> SUE: Yes.
657,00:36:46.00,00:36:46.00,"Yes. >> JEFF: By the way, Big Tom,"
658,00:36:48.13,00:36:48.13,how are you feeling? 'Cause you took a hard hit to
659,00:36:50.80,00:36:50.80,the chest or the head today. >> TOM: I didn't see it coming.
660,00:36:53.63,00:36:53.63,"And, uh, the only thing I asked them was, I wanted them to get"
661,00:36:56.23,00:36:56.23,the tag number off that truck that hit me.
662,00:36:58.27,00:36:58.27,">> JEFF: First 12 days for Chapera, up until today, have"
663,00:37:02.17,00:37:02.17,"been pretty cush. Big Tom, are you noticing"
664,00:37:05.23,00:37:05.23,relationships form? >> TOM: There's a little bit
665,00:37:07.90,00:37:07.90,"of... I've been noticing cuddling, and"
666,00:37:09.73,00:37:09.73,there might be a little grinding there late one night.
667,00:37:12.27,00:37:12.27,>> JEFF: You looked at Boston Rob when you said that.
668,00:37:14.67,00:37:14.67,">> TOM: Well, I've been kind of watching him a little bit, and"
669,00:37:17.60,00:37:17.60,he don't sleep on his back every night.
670,00:37:19.53,00:37:19.53,( quiet laughter ) >> JEFF: Who are you sleeping
671,00:37:22.70,00:37:22.70,"next to, Boston Rob? >> ROB M.: I'm sleeping next to"
672,00:37:25.23,00:37:25.23,Amber. >> JEFF: Are you blushing?
673,00:37:27.67,00:37:27.67,>> AMBER: No. >> JEFF: A little bit?
674,00:37:29.67,00:37:29.67,>> AMBER: No. >> JEFF: A little something
675,00:37:31.97,00:37:31.97,going on? >> AMBER: I'm 25.
676,00:37:33.77,00:37:33.77,I'm young and having fun. >> TOM: I'm 48 and old and
677,00:37:37.67,00:37:37.67,watching having fun. ( Amber laughs )
678,00:37:40.00,00:37:40.00,">> JEFF: Is there a little snuggling going on with, uh,"
679,00:37:42.73,00:37:42.73,Boston Rob? >> AMBER: We need to keep warm
680,00:37:45.37,00:37:45.37,at night. >> JEFF: So this is strictly
681,00:37:47.97,00:37:47.97,survival cuddling. >> AMBER: I'm out here to play
682,00:37:50.63,00:37:50.63,the game of Survivor. I'm not out here to play a
683,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,"dating game. >> JEFF: Alicia, give me the"
684,00:37:54.70,00:37:54.70,"straight scoop. >> ALICIA: Okay, these two are--"
685,00:37:56.90,00:37:56.90,You can't even get between them. You got to be kidding me.
686,00:37:59.50,00:37:59.50,"Seriously, they're very close. I wouldn't even try to sleep"
687,00:38:02.23,00:38:02.23,next to Boston Rob and push Amber to the other side.
688,00:38:04.57,00:38:04.57,That's-that's even out of the question.
689,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,">> JEFF: Does that concern you, Boston Rob, that there might be"
690,00:38:09.10,00:38:09.10,an impression formed? >> ROB M: No. It's obvious.
691,00:38:11.27,00:38:11.27,"I mean, we've been flirting with each other from day one, since"
692,00:38:14.03,00:38:14.03,"we got out here. But in terms of the game,"
693,00:38:16.37,00:38:16.37,"there's going to be one winner, and my commitment to the game is"
694,00:38:20.00,00:38:20.00,first and foremost. >> JEFF: So let's talk about how
695,00:38:24.70,00:38:24.70,you're going to vote somebody out tonight.
696,00:38:26.63,00:38:26.63,"What do you base it on, Big Tom? >> TOM: Right now I was thinking"
697,00:38:30.03,00:38:30.03,about our tribe and making it stronger going into
698,00:38:32.80,00:38:32.80,challenges... >> JEFF: So you're basing your
699,00:38:35.63,00:38:35.63,vote on who the tribe can afford to lose?
700,00:38:38.00,00:38:38.00,">> TOM: Yeah. Basically, yes."
701,00:38:39.40,00:38:39.40,">> JEFF: What-What could cause you to get voted off tonight,"
702,00:38:42.43,00:38:42.43,Boston Rob? >> ROB M.: I guess my mouth and
703,00:38:44.93,00:38:44.93,"my attitude. What else, Amber?"
704,00:38:46.77,00:38:46.77,"(Amber, Rob M. laugh) >> JEFF: Wow, you guys really"
705,00:38:49.30,00:38:49.30,have become a couple. ( laughter )
706,00:38:50.77,00:38:50.77,You just asked your wife. That was pretty telling.
707,00:38:53.07,00:38:53.07,What else could get Boston Rob in trouble?
708,00:38:54.90,00:38:54.90,">> AMBER: I just think he has a big mouth, and he needs to keep"
709,00:38:57.30,00:38:57.30,"it shut a lot, at challenges, at camp, all the time."
710,00:38:59.27,00:38:59.27,"He has a big mouth, and he needs to keep it shut."
711,00:39:01.50,00:39:01.50,">> ROB M.: I'm very emotional, Jeff."
712,00:39:03.47,00:39:03.47,">> JEFF: Sue, worried at all that it might be you, really?"
713,00:39:06.73,00:39:06.73,">> SUE: Oh, yeah. Ever since I stepped on the"
714,00:39:11.07,00:39:11.07,island. >> JEFF: Why vote you out?
715,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,>> SUE: 'Cause I can just be a bitch to be around sometimes.
716,00:39:17.00,00:39:17.00,"I mean, you know... Hey?"
717,00:39:18.80,00:39:18.80,>> TOM: Hoo-ha. I didn't say nothing.
718,00:39:21.70,00:39:21.70,"( laughter ) >> SUE: So, yeah, and I don't go"
719,00:39:25.00,00:39:25.00,around sucking up to people or trying to pretend to be
720,00:39:27.70,00:39:27.70,something I'm not. >> JEFF: Okay.
721,00:39:29.63,00:39:29.63,"It is time to vote. Rob, you're up."
722,00:39:46.87,00:39:46.87,">> ROB C.: I'm a little uneasy about this vote tonight, but if"
723,00:39:49.60,00:39:49.60,"everything goes through with this, I have a feeling the next"
724,00:39:52.30,00:39:52.30,"time I see you, there's going to be a big finger wagging in my"
725,00:39:55.07,00:39:55.07,"face. >> ALICIA: Rob C., you're a"
726,00:40:19.07,00:40:19.07,"great guy, and you're really funny, but I think what we need"
727,00:40:22.63,00:40:22.63,from here on out is a little more seriousness.
728,00:40:38.43,00:40:38.43,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
729,00:40:55.03,00:40:55.03,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
730,00:40:56.83,00:40:56.83,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
731,00:40:58.90,00:40:58.90,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
732,00:41:02.33,00:41:02.33,First vote-- Rob C. Alicia.
733,00:41:10.50,00:41:10.50,"One vote, Alicia, one vote, Rob. Rob."
734,00:41:15.73,00:41:15.73,"Two votes Rob, one vote Alicia. Rob."
