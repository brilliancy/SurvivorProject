394,00:24:06.12,00:24:06.12,little bit.>> I've never really never for
395,00:24:08.92,00:24:08.92,once ever in my life everconsidered that I would own a

397,00:24:14.12,00:24:14.12,crossed my mind.>> You can only hear so much

402,00:24:29.25,00:24:29.25,probably best to stop that talk.>> There's no guarantee that
403,00:24:31.92,00:24:31.92,you're going to win.I really don't think winning a
404,00:24:34.25,00:24:34.25,car has anything to do with it.>> No.
405,00:24:36.25,00:24:36.25,">> You have a brand-new, nice-smelling vehicle."
406,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,>> It was so unexpected.They were excited to hear about
407,00:24:40.67,00:24:40.67,the car.Everyone seemed to think that
408,00:24:43.12,00:24:43.12,choosing the car and the rewardfor myself was the right thing
409,00:24:46.08,00:24:46.08,"to do.No one, um, seemed to have any"
410,00:24:49.17,00:24:49.17,qualms about it at all.>> She's so happy about the car.
411,00:24:52.67,00:24:52.67,"I mean, that's all she talkedabout was the car."
412,00:24:55.08,00:24:55.08,>> Really?>> She felt bad.
413,00:24:56.42,00:24:56.42,"Now, I'm like, why are you goingto feel bad?"
414,00:24:59.00,00:24:59.00,Why are you going to give thecar up?
415,00:25:01.12,00:25:01.12,">> Yeah, well, see, Danni and Iboth thought that she was."
416,00:25:04.79,00:25:04.79,>> So did I.She was considering it.
417,00:25:07.42,00:25:07.42,>> I... I didn't-- Danni and Iboth thought there wasn't any
418,00:25:11.08,00:25:11.08,other option than to give up thecar.
419,00:25:13.75,00:25:13.75,">> What do you mean?>> Like, if they had asked me"
420,00:25:16.62,00:25:16.62,"that, like, there's no way Iwould have kept it."
421,00:25:19.33,00:25:19.33,>> Really? Why?>> No way.
422,00:25:21.21,00:25:21.21,Because it's like four of youguys could have a car.
423,00:25:24.04,00:25:24.04,>> You thought you had to giveit up?
424,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,">> Not that you had to, but Ijust... I would have."
425,00:25:28.33,00:25:28.33,>> Really?!I didn't think anybody would
426,00:25:30.62,00:25:30.62,have.That's a tough decision.
427,00:25:32.33,00:25:32.33,>> Yeah.>> I don't think I would have
428,00:25:34.25,00:25:34.25,"done it.I could not believe he said, ""I"
429,00:25:37.12,00:25:37.12,"would have gave the other fourthe car."""
430,00:25:39.08,00:25:39.08,"I was like... no way.Seriously, sometimes I just feel"
431,00:25:43.33,00:25:43.33,like Rafe does try to play themartyr a little bit.
432,00:25:45.42,00:25:45.42,That was like the first timeRafe and I have ever disagreed
433,00:25:48.04,00:25:48.04,"the whole game.Wow, that's surprising."
434,00:25:50.79,00:25:50.79,I don't think I would have.>> I would have in like a
435,00:25:53.12,00:25:53.12,heartbeat.>> But a car when you don't have
436,00:25:55.12,00:25:55.12,"one?Lydia, you would have given up"
437,00:25:58.42,00:25:58.42,the car?>> I think Cindy made the right
438,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,choice.>> Yeah.
439,00:26:03.96,00:26:03.96,>> The only thing that I wasthinking about is the fact that
440,00:26:07.12,00:26:07.12,"you can give four other peoplea car, and it seems like"
441,00:26:09.42,00:26:09.42,everyone else was thinking aboutwhat they could have.
442,00:26:12.46,00:26:12.46,"So, it kind of made me thinklike, am I playing this game too"
443,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,"nicely right now?Like, should I be playing this"
444,00:26:18.79,00:26:18.79,game a little bit harder than Iam?

563,00:33:49.54,00:33:49.54,"was the first thing where Istepped back and was, like,"
564,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,whoa.Maybe I'm not going to be
565,00:33:55.12,00:33:55.12,Cindy's biggest fan.It will come down to my powers
566,00:33:57.50,00:33:57.50,"of persuasion here, but I'mpretty sure that I can convince"
567,00:34:01.12,00:34:01.12,Steph we should vote out Cindy.>> You do?
568,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,>> For sure.You know what I mean?
569,00:34:15.83,00:34:15.83,">> Yeah.>> Yeah, but now if I vote off"
570,00:34:22.12,00:34:22.12,"Cindy, there's another vote,I'm not going to get Jamie's,"
571,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,"Judd's or Cindy's, if I get thetwo."
572,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,>> Wait. Did you make a dealwith Cindy?
573,00:34:30.25,00:34:30.25,">> No.I mean, I told her that I was"
574,00:34:34.25,00:34:34.25,"pretty sure that we weresticking together, me and you"
575,00:34:36.21,00:34:36.21,and her.It seems like Rafe is leaning
576,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,"towards getting rid of Cindy,and I told him I felt"
577,00:34:43.17,00:34:43.17,"really bad because we alreadyturned on Judd, and Cindy is in"
578,00:34:46.17,00:34:46.17,"our alliance, and now we'regoing to be turning on Cindy,"
579,00:34:48.00,00:34:48.00,"and now I don't know if this isgonna make me look worse,"
580,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,"because Cindy just took me ona reward, and this might be"
581,00:34:52.92,00:34:52.92,another vote I could lose whenit comes time for the jury.
582,00:34:57.67,00:34:57.67,"But the same time, she's a hugethreat in this game, and she"
583,00:35:00.33,00:35:00.33,"knows it, and she has a car atleast."
584,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,"So, I don't know what's going tohappen. I don't know."
585,00:35:11.54,00:35:11.54,"Earlier today, I was, like...talking about, Danni, right?"
586,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"And he's like, ""I was,"" buthe's like, "" We kind of think"
587,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67,that Cindy is a bigger threatbecause he'd rather go up
588,00:35:22.04,00:35:22.04,"against Danni.For some reason, they think"
589,00:35:26.50,00:35:26.50,"like you're this huge threat.Right, well he knows that,"
590,00:35:32.58,00:35:32.58,but....>> When I was on the reward
591,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,"Stephenie, we talked abouteliminating Danni, but now I"
592,00:35:38.71,00:35:38.71,"know Rafe is more of a threatthan anyone, so if I could get"
593,00:35:43.04,00:35:43.04,"rid of Rafe, I think that wouldbe to my benefit."
594,00:35:45.00,00:35:45.00,"I think the girls were having amuch better shot at, you know,"
595,00:35:49.04,00:35:49.04,"winning this.Danni, just so you know, voting"

599,00:36:02.58,00:36:02.58,"threat because I've won a coupleof them, but he's just going to"
600,00:36:06.79,00:36:06.79,beat you guys in the challengesand then vote you out.
601,00:36:09.17,00:36:09.17,>> I know he's the strongest.>> He can beat any of us in the

603,00:36:14.58,00:36:14.58,>> Yeah.There's nothing he can't do.
604,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,Smartest thing would be toeliminate him.
605,00:36:20.33,00:36:20.33,Have all girls go to the finalfour.

624,00:38:04.46,00:38:04.46,"the game, and I give you achance to give it up and get rid"
625,00:38:07.71,00:38:07.71,"of that curse, and also gainfavor by giving everybody else a"
626,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,"car.You say no, I'm keeping it, and"
627,00:38:13.04,00:38:13.04,I'm going to win the game.Still feel confident you can

631,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,They could very likely vote youout the next day after you gave
632,00:38:26.67,00:38:26.67,"them a car, then you're leftwith nothing."
633,00:38:28.92,00:38:28.92,"So I thought the curse thing wassilly, that if you win the car,"
634,00:38:31.83,00:38:31.83,you're not going to win amillion dollars.
635,00:38:33.79,00:38:33.79,"The curse is being a strongcompetitor and winning thing,"
636,00:38:36.46,00:38:36.46,"regardless of what it is, a car,a pile of cookies, whatever it"
637,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,"is.If you are a tough competitor,"
638,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,that's your curse.I don't think it has anything to
639,00:38:43.21,00:38:43.21,"do with the car.So, I'm totally content with the"
640,00:38:45.92,00:38:45.92,decision that I made.I think I made the right one.

644,00:38:57.83,00:38:57.83,people should be most concernedabout.
645,00:38:59.92,00:38:59.92,"We all have seen him winchallenge after challenge,"
646,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,"whether it's physical or mental,so he's good at everything, and"
647,00:39:05.33,00:39:05.33,"people like him.So, there you go."
