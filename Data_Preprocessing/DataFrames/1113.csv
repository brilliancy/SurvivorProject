6,00:00:13.00,00:00:13.00,breaking up. I'm definitely not going down
7,00:00:15.08,00:00:15.08,without a fight. >> PROBST: Sold!
8,00:00:17.04,00:00:17.04,The survivors participated in an auction.
9,00:00:19.12,00:00:19.12,>> $180. >> $200.
10,00:00:20.04,00:00:20.04,>> Sold. And Danni outbid the others for

12,00:00:25.12,00:00:25.12,challenge. It needs to remain sealed.
13,00:00:27.08,00:00:27.08,We'll deal with it when you get to the next challenge.
14,00:00:30.08,00:00:30.08,>> Okay. ( gasping )
15,00:00:31.71,00:00:31.71,>> PROBST: The last item offered up was an overnight visit with a
16,00:00:34.42,00:00:34.42,"loved one. >> $60, $70, $880."
17,00:00:37.04,00:00:37.04,">> PROBST: Judd bought a night with his wife, Kristin."
18,00:00:39.96,00:00:39.96,"Judd, you have purchased the right to invite two other loved"
19,00:00:44.29,00:00:44.29,"ones to camp with you as well. >> Oh, my God."
20,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17,">> Yes! >> Cindy, without a doubt, and"
21,00:00:48.38,00:00:48.38,I'm going to take my Jersey girl with me.
22,00:00:50.67,00:00:50.67,>> PROBST: Cindy's sister Mindy and Stephenie's boyfriend
23,00:00:53.04,00:00:53.04,"Michael joined them. Danni, Rafe, and Lydia were"
24,00:00:57.92,00:00:57.92,exiled from the group and forced to spend the night at the old
25,00:01:01.04,00:01:01.04,Yaxha camp. >> This is lake water that we
26,00:01:02.67,00:01:02.67,got boil. >> PROBST: While the loved ones
27,00:01:04.54,00:01:04.54,"got a taste of camp life. At the old Yaxha camp, Danni and"
28,00:01:13.71,00:01:13.71,Rafe strategized. >> We just need to catch Judd in
29,00:01:17.25,00:01:17.25,"some kind of lie, so that we can show Steph..."
30,00:01:20.54,00:01:20.54,>> The only person I really feel like I can't trust now is Rafe.
31,00:01:23.08,00:01:23.08,I'm important to have around for him because they have to see '05
32,00:01:27.04,00:01:27.04,"as the threat. >> PROBST: The next morning,"
33,00:01:29.50,00:01:29.50,"Danni, Rafe, and Lydia returned to camp and the loved ones said"
34,00:01:33.04,00:01:33.04,"their good-byes. >> Bye-bye, you guys!"
35,00:01:35.92,00:01:35.92,">> PROBST: Before the immunity challenge, Lydia tried to ally"
36,00:01:39.21,00:01:39.21,"herself with Judd, while Danni listened in."
37,00:01:51.96,00:01:51.96,"In a mental challenge for immunity, Danni used her secret"
38,00:01:55.50,00:01:55.50,"clue from the auction. >> ""Switch positions with any"
39,00:01:58.12,00:01:58.12,"player."" I'm going to switch with Steph."
40,00:02:00.04,00:02:00.04,>> PROBST: The clue paid off when Danni beat out Steph.
41,00:02:03.17,00:02:03.17,Danni wins immunity. You are safe tonight at Tribal
42,00:02:06.58,00:02:06.58,Council. Danni's next move was to target
43,00:02:09.96,00:02:09.96,Judd by exposing his earlier conversation.
44,00:02:19.42,00:02:19.42,">> I'd like to believe Judd, but he's already been caught in"
45,00:02:21.92,00:02:21.92,"quite a few lies, and Danni really hasn't lied at all."
46,00:02:26.71,00:02:26.71,>> PROBST: Danni's maneuvering worked.
47,00:02:29.67,00:02:29.67,"Judd and Cindy were taken by surprise when Stephenie, Rafe,"
48,00:02:32.25,00:02:32.25,Lydia and Danni banded together and voted out Judd.
49,00:02:36.71,00:02:36.71,">> Thanks, guys. Hope you guys all get bit by a"
50,00:02:39.17,00:02:39.17,freaking crocodile. Scumbags.
51,00:02:41.62,00:02:41.62,">> PROBST: Judd, the tribe has spoken."
52,00:02:44.21,00:02:44.21,Five are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
53,00:02:56.04,00:02:56.04,( theme song playing ) >> It was just really hard for
54,00:04:00.46,00:04:00.46,"me, because I had been really close to him."
55,00:04:02.42,00:04:02.42,But as he spoke. >> Scumbags?
56,00:04:03.96,00:04:03.96,">> Scumbags, and hopes we get eaten by crocodiles."
57,00:04:06.38,00:04:06.38,"I mean, he almost started to turn into Jamie a little bit."
58,00:04:09.58,00:04:09.58,">> He was pissed. >> Judd got voted out tonight,"
59,00:04:13.17,00:04:13.17,completely blindsided. Stephenie and Rafe broke that
60,00:04:17.21,00:04:17.21,"alliance, and I had been praying for a crack in that alliance."
61,00:04:22.62,00:04:22.62,">> Cindy, I wanted to tell you so bad."
62,00:04:24.62,00:04:24.62,">> You didn't have to tell me, but, you know, to talk to me,"
63,00:04:26.79,00:04:26.79,"and then you could tell by a conversation with me, which way"
64,00:04:30.21,00:04:30.21,I'm leaning. I thought we were voting out
65,00:04:33.33,00:04:33.33,"Lydia, and that was our plan for, you know, the past few"
66,00:04:38.38,00:04:38.38,"days, but, apparently, I was not privileged to the information."
67,00:04:43.17,00:04:43.17,">> Judd's gone tonight, and you're still here."
68,00:04:46.08,00:04:46.08,"Like, you know, I mean, it wasn't like I was making a"
69,00:04:48.25,00:04:48.25,decision whether to vote you out.
70,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,">> I just don't want to follow in Jamie and Judd's footsteps,"
71,00:04:51.38,00:04:51.38,but the pattern makes me nervous.
72,00:04:53.12,00:04:53.12,"You didn't tell Judd that you were voting out Jamie, and now"
73,00:04:56.46,00:04:56.46,"Jamie is gone, and then you didn't tell me that you were"
74,00:04:59.12,00:04:59.12,"voting out Judd, and now Judd is gone, so then where does that"
75,00:05:01.38,00:05:01.38,"put me? Next thing you know, I'm going"
76,00:05:03.29,00:05:03.29,"to be gone. >> No, it could be any of us."
77,00:05:05.08,00:05:05.08,">> I know it could be, but I see a little pattern there, and it"
78,00:05:08.04,00:05:08.04,"makes me uncomfortable. Judd is gone, and I'm still"
79,00:05:10.25,00:05:10.25,"here, so I'm going to have to deal with it... move on."
80,00:05:28.12,00:05:28.12,>> How fitting is this that you're the only guy left?
81,00:05:30.54,00:05:30.54,">> It's hilarious. And the hardest survivor ever,"
82,00:05:34.12,00:05:34.12,it's the gay guy and four women in the final five.
83,00:05:36.92,00:05:36.92,>> All the boys pretty much are on the jury.
84,00:05:40.67,00:05:40.67,>> I'm the last man standing. I'm sitting around camp with
85,00:05:44.12,00:05:44.12,"four girls, and I'm really happy."
86,00:05:46.21,00:05:46.21,It's like Rafe's Angels around camp.
87,00:05:49.21,00:05:49.21,>> Things we're not going to miss about Guatemala.
88,00:05:51.67,00:05:51.67,>> Naked Judd. ( laughter )
89,00:05:55.17,00:05:55.17,"It's kind of like when Judd is voted out, that the cool kid"
90,00:05:58.21,00:05:58.21,"kind of left the class, and now we can all be like a little"
91,00:06:01.50,00:06:01.50,"bit dorkier, a little bit more fun."
92,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33,( laughter ) >> Make yourselves cross-eyed.
93,00:06:07.62,00:06:07.62,">> Ooh, that's very disturbing. ( laughter )"
94,00:06:12.00,00:06:12.00,">> I know. >> No, not quite."
95,00:06:15.25,00:06:15.25,>> What am I doing? >> You're just opening them
96,00:06:17.42,00:06:17.42,really wide. You're like....
97,00:06:19.29,00:06:19.29,"( chuckling ) >> Rafe, he's a real gentle type"
98,00:06:23.12,00:06:23.12,"of a male, and he fits right in with us, so we're looking at him"
99,00:06:27.71,00:06:27.71,as one of the girls. >> Justin Timberlake was
100,00:06:30.71,00:06:30.71,"Backstreet, right? >> 'NSync."
101,00:06:32.83,00:06:32.83,">> He's hot. >> Yeah, he is."
102,00:06:34.88,00:06:34.88,\xe2\x99\xaa My one desire Tell me why... \xe2\x99\xaa
103,00:06:42.25,00:06:42.25,"In all honesty, even though these four women are here, and"
104,00:06:45.71,00:06:45.71,"they could easily vote me out, on a close, personal level, I"
105,00:06:48.46,00:06:48.46,have a really personal friendship with all four of the
106,00:06:51.04,00:06:51.04,"people left in this game. And, you know, that's the thing"
107,00:06:54.62,00:06:54.62,that I'm hoping will get me to the end.
108,00:07:05.04,00:07:05.04,"( gasps ) >> Oh, my gosh!"
109,00:07:07.08,00:07:07.08,">> Oh... >> Oh, my gosh!"
110,00:07:10.29,00:07:10.29,"You guys! Here, read it."
111,00:07:13.67,00:07:13.67,">> Shut the hell up! Oh, God!"
112,00:07:18.08,00:07:18.08,"That's it. >> That is insane, you guys."
113,00:07:22.08,00:07:22.08,>> One of us is going to own a car today.
114,00:07:24.25,00:07:24.25,">> Oh, my God! >> This might be one of the best"
115,00:07:27.38,00:07:27.38,tree mails yet. It looks like the reward is
116,00:07:30.12,00:07:30.12,going to be a car. >> It's just a car key.
117,00:07:32.62,00:07:32.62,>> And I personally have never had my own car.
118,00:07:35.04,00:07:35.04,"So, I'm in desperate need of a car."
119,00:07:37.88,00:07:37.88,">> Lydia, look. >> And they're trying to win a"
120,00:07:39.83,00:07:39.83,car. >> My gosh!
121,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,"I haven't really won anything, so I just have this crazy"
122,00:07:46.62,00:07:46.62,feeling that this might be my opportunity.
123,00:07:48.79,00:07:48.79,This one's for my son. He's 17 years old.
124,00:07:51.25,00:07:51.25,This is for him. I'm going to have to work real
125,00:07:53.92,00:07:53.92,hard for it. >> I know.
126,00:07:58.83,00:07:58.83,>> Could you imagine? >> This is not a good time for
127,00:08:01.12,00:08:01.12,"me to try to not chew my nails. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
128,00:08:10.79,00:08:10.79,>> Wow. >> Wow.
129,00:08:16.29,00:08:16.29,>> This is crazy. >> PROBST: We haven't even got
130,00:08:24.54,00:08:24.54,to the challenge and everybody's already smiling.
131,00:08:27.08,00:08:27.08,"( laughter ) All right, today's challenge is"
132,00:08:29.29,00:08:29.29,"for reward, and it's called ""Second Chance,"" because that's"
133,00:08:32.71,00:08:32.71,"exactly what it is, a second chance at some of the challenges"
134,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,"from the past. On my go, all five of you will"
135,00:08:38.79,00:08:38.79,"race across a balance beam, untying three sets of mckannas"
136,00:08:42.00,00:08:42.00,as you go. The first three to cross the
137,00:08:46.08,00:08:46.08,finish line with all of their mckannas move to the next round.
138,00:08:49.25,00:08:49.25,"For the next round, you will use those mckannas to attempt to"
139,00:08:53.04,00:08:53.04,"break a single tile, 30 feet away."
140,00:08:55.96,00:08:55.96,"The first two to break their tile, move on to the last round."
141,00:09:00.21,00:09:00.21,"For the final round, you must solve a puzzle based on the Maya"
142,00:09:03.38,00:09:03.38,"calendar. Once you solve the puzzle, you"
143,00:09:06.25,00:09:06.25,hop in the cart. Use the machete to chop the rope
144,00:09:08.96,00:09:08.96,which will release the cart and send you racing down to the
145,00:09:11.75,00:09:11.75,finish. First one to the finish wins
146,00:09:14.21,00:09:14.21,reward. I think you know what you're
147,00:09:16.29,00:09:16.29,playing for. >> Yeah.
148,00:09:18.21,00:09:18.21,>> PROBST: 2006 Pontiac Torrent.
149,00:09:20.25,00:09:20.25,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: The winner gets the"
150,00:09:23.21,00:09:23.21,car. You will drive away and head
151,00:09:25.96,00:09:25.96,"down to an archaeologist's camp, where we've set up a barbecue"
152,00:09:29.21,00:09:29.21,"feast. >> Oh, my God."
153,00:09:31.08,00:09:31.08,"Steak, sausage, eggs, veggies, a couple of bottles of rum."
154,00:09:37.00,00:09:37.00,>> Oh! >> PROBST: You will spend the
155,00:09:39.04,00:09:39.04,"night, return to camp in the morning."
156,00:09:41.62,00:09:41.62,">> Oh, my gosh! >> PROBST: Worth playing for?"
157,00:09:43.88,00:09:43.88,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: Here we go."

161,00:10:01.25,00:10:01.25,Already untying. Everybody at their first
162,00:10:05.88,00:10:05.88,"mckannas. Balance, patience; if you fall"
163,00:10:10.04,00:10:10.04,"off the beam, you must go back to the start."
164,00:10:13.12,00:10:13.12,"Steph, making good progress. Steph and Cindy and Danni."
165,00:10:20.71,00:10:20.71,Danni almost falls off. Rafe has his.

171,00:10:43.42,00:10:43.42,She's got to go back to the start.
172,00:10:46.17,00:10:46.17,It's now Danni and Cindy. And here comes Rafe.
173,00:10:47.92,00:10:47.92,"Lydia falls off, back to the start."
174,00:10:51.17,00:10:51.17,Cindy teetering. Hanging on.
175,00:10:56.25,00:10:56.25,Rafe falls off. Rafe back to the start.
176,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,Suddenly Steph's back in it. Three people moving on.
177,00:11:03.21,00:11:03.21,Cindy falls off. She's got to go back to the

179,00:11:10.08,00:11:10.08,Lydia falls off and back to the start.

181,00:11:18.00,00:11:18.00,Danni has hers untied. She's going to make a run for
182,00:11:22.25,00:11:22.25,it. She's got to stay on.
183,00:11:24.67,00:11:24.67,Danni's across. Danni moving on.
184,00:11:27.71,00:11:27.71,Cindy's across. Cindy moving on.
185,00:11:30.25,00:11:30.25,There's one spot left. It's Rafe and Steph.
186,00:11:34.29,00:11:34.29,Steph with a bit of a lead on the knots.
187,00:11:38.25,00:11:38.25,Rafe catching up. Steph has hers free.
188,00:11:43.12,00:11:43.12,"Steph, third person moving on. Here we go."

234,00:15:11.25,00:15:11.25,"superstitions, but I also want them to have cars."
235,00:15:22.04,00:15:22.04,"I also believe in making the impossible possible, which means"
236,00:15:26.25,00:15:26.25,screw the curse. I can win the car and the
237,00:15:29.92,00:15:29.92,million dollars if I play my cards right and if I do my best.
238,00:15:33.04,00:15:33.04,>> PROBST: Tough decision. You gotta make a decision right
239,00:15:36.96,00:15:36.96,now. What's it going to be?

257,00:16:35.04,00:16:35.04,">> We love you. >> Bye, guys."

267,00:17:21.12,00:17:21.12,"Well, this zookeeper does. >> She seemed to really"
268,00:17:24.33,00:17:24.33,appreciate what this meant to me.
269,00:17:26.58,00:17:26.58,I don't think I've ever been that happy in my whole life.
270,00:17:29.12,00:17:29.12,>> How cool was it to see three chiquitas at the finish
271,00:17:33.96,00:17:33.96,"line? Oh, my God! >> Chicks rule."
272,00:17:35.75,00:17:35.75,">> It was awesome. >> I was just like, man, chicks"
273,00:17:38.21,00:17:38.21,rule in this game. >> Yeah.

275,00:17:45.46,00:17:45.46,>> My God! >> I'm so happy for you.
276,00:17:49.21,00:17:49.21,"So we pulled up to the archeological site, and there"
277,00:17:51.62,00:17:51.62,"was an archaeologist guy sitting there, waiting for us."
278,00:17:55.42,00:17:55.42,">> Hey, guys. >> Hello."
279,00:17:58.08,00:17:58.08,>> My name is Federico Farson. >> Nice to meet you.

282,00:18:08.46,00:18:08.46,but we've got lots of good things for you.
283,00:18:11.25,00:18:11.25,>> Yay! >> Food over here.
284,00:18:13.00,00:18:13.00,"There's meat, there's vegetables, there's rum."
285,00:18:15.92,00:18:15.92,"Enjoy it. I'll be back in a while, you"
286,00:18:18.46,00:18:18.46,know after you have... >> Come have a drink with us.
287,00:18:21.88,00:18:21.88,">> Yeah, I will. >> Thank you. Nice to meet you."
288,00:18:24.04,00:18:24.04,">> Oh, my God. Gosh, look at all that meat."
289,00:18:28.21,00:18:28.21,More meat than we've seen in 30- some days.
290,00:18:31.17,00:18:31.17,">> Yeah, it is. I'm so excited."
291,00:18:34.50,00:18:34.50,To your new car. >> Thank you.
292,00:18:39.00,00:18:39.00,>> Cheers to that. >> Thank you.
293,00:18:40.96,00:18:40.96,>> Never in Survivor has the winner of the car ever won the
294,00:18:43.42,00:18:43.42,"million dollars. So they, like, call it the"
295,00:18:46.46,00:18:46.46,"Survivor curse of the cars. Oh, my gosh, they're going to be"
296,00:18:49.46,00:18:49.46,"so jealous, they're going to vote us out right away."
297,00:18:52.08,00:18:52.08,"It was really hard because you look at all the four people,"
298,00:18:55.33,00:18:55.33,"and you're thinking, when in my life will I ever have the"
299,00:18:58.04,00:18:58.04,capacity to give four people new cars?
300,00:19:02.21,00:19:02.21,"Like, I don't know anybody who has the ability to do that."
301,00:19:06.25,00:19:06.25,"Maybe Oprah. If you win, you win."
302,00:19:10.17,00:19:10.17,">> Yeah, why should you feel bad?"
303,00:19:11.62,00:19:11.62,">> I don't know. >> I think at this point, there"
304,00:19:14.25,00:19:14.25,are no guarantees. They're not going to give you a
305,00:19:16.25,00:19:16.25,million dollars because you gave them a car.
306,00:19:21.83,00:19:21.83,"So I took the car, and I don't think anybody was bitter about"
307,00:19:25.08,00:19:25.08,"it at all. >> I was, like, shocked."
308,00:19:31.42,00:19:31.42,I just couldn't believe that that was the decision Cindy
309,00:19:35.88,00:19:35.88,"made. For me, that didn't seem like a"
310,00:19:37.88,00:19:37.88,"choice. It was, like, you have to give"
311,00:19:40.21,00:19:40.21,the car to the four other people.
312,00:19:42.58,00:19:42.58,"Like, there was nothing else I would have done."
313,00:19:44.50,00:19:44.50,"Like, I never would have taken the car for myself."
314,00:19:47.54,00:19:47.54,"I was standing there, and I'm going like, oh, my gosh."
315,00:19:51.17,00:19:51.17,This is so sad for Cindy. She deserves that so much.
316,00:19:54.04,00:19:54.04,>> Uh-huh. >> And now she has to give it
317,00:19:56.08,00:19:56.08,"up, because there's, like, no other choice."
318,00:19:58.12,00:19:58.12,">> Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking."
319,00:20:00.38,00:20:00.38,"I was like, oh, no. You know, I was just like, you"
320,00:20:02.58,00:20:02.58,"know, oh, my God. I actually thought Cindy would"
321,00:20:05.46,00:20:05.46,"do it, because I would have done it in a heartbeat."
322,00:20:07.92,00:20:07.92,Because you would have four people who were very happy with
323,00:20:12.04,00:20:12.04,you. >> In my mind I'm thinking:
324,00:20:14.00,00:20:14.00,"""Cindy, keep the car, you deserve it."
325,00:20:15.17,00:20:15.17,"You won it rightfully,"" you know..."
326,00:20:18.17,00:20:18.17,>> She needed a car. >> Yeah.
327,00:20:20.42,00:20:20.42,">> I was just thinking, like, four people can have a car, or"
328,00:20:23.08,00:20:23.08,one... you know what I mean? I know that if Cindy had decided
329,00:20:26.67,00:20:26.67,"to give the four of us cars, there's no way on earth I could"
330,00:20:30.79,00:20:30.79,vote her out at the next Tribal Council.
331,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,But now you never know what's going to happen.
332,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,">> My God, this is so good. That steak is unreal."
333,00:20:43.25,00:20:43.25,That good? >> Mmmm-hmmm.
334,00:20:46.96,00:20:46.96,( chuckles ) Hello there.
335,00:20:48.96,00:20:48.96,>> How was dinner? >> It was so good.
336,00:20:52.04,00:20:52.04,There's so much to eat. >> We have lots of leftovers to
337,00:20:54.17,00:20:54.17,drink. >> Federico came back after we
338,00:20:57.58,00:20:57.58,"had cooked our food, and he sat down and told us story after"
339,00:21:02.04,00:21:02.04,story about the Mayans and the ruins and answered
340,00:21:04.58,00:21:04.58,questions. >> They really ate that corn all
341,00:21:07.67,00:21:07.67,the time? >> All the time.
342,00:21:09.79,00:21:09.79,Corn is the basic food of the Maya then and the Maya now.
343,00:21:18.33,00:21:18.33,>> Oh. >> He's a real-life
344,00:21:20.75,00:21:20.75,"archaeologist, which to me, very cool."
345,00:21:23.54,00:21:23.54,">> Yasha means green-blue. >> That was our color, yeah."
346,00:21:28.08,00:21:28.08,>> And Yaxha means water. So green-blue water is the lake
347,00:21:33.75,00:21:33.75,"right there. >> Oh, okay."
348,00:21:35.92,00:21:35.92,">> All the while, I'm listening to his stories, and right behind"
349,00:21:37.88,00:21:37.88,"me, every time I turn my head, out of the corner of my eye, I"
350,00:21:41.54,00:21:41.54,can see this car sitting there that's mine.
351,00:21:44.83,00:21:44.83,I get to keep that. >> So nice to meet you.
352,00:21:47.12,00:21:47.12,>> Bye-bye. >> Thank you so much.
353,00:21:48.71,00:21:48.71,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Look how cute that is.
354,00:21:54.21,00:21:54.21,"Oh, my God! Oh, there's candles!"
355,00:21:58.29,00:21:58.29,And blankets. >> How pretty is this?
356,00:22:02.29,00:22:02.29,">> Um, I've just been thinking, I really like Danni, but I"
357,00:22:06.75,00:22:06.75,really don't want to chance it. >> And lose to her.
358,00:22:10.08,00:22:10.08,">> Right. If she went further than me,"
359,00:22:13.21,00:22:13.21,"that would suck, or you or Rafe. >> Danni?"
360,00:22:15.62,00:22:15.62,">> Yeah, because, like, we were the ones that came in with the"
361,00:22:17.92,00:22:17.92,numbers. >> And we had the chance to get
362,00:22:19.88,00:22:19.88,to get rid of her and we didn't. >> A number of times.
363,00:22:22.29,00:22:22.29,"I mean, all it would take would be me, you, and Lydia, but I"
364,00:22:26.12,00:22:26.12,would like to include Rafe. >> I think he'd be willing
365,00:22:29.67,00:22:29.67,"to go. I mean, it guarantees you"
366,00:22:32.12,00:22:32.12,another day in the game. I was able to spend a lot of
367,00:22:34.79,00:22:34.79,time with Stephenie and find out what the heck was going on.
368,00:22:37.21,00:22:37.21,"If we beat each other, that's one thing, but she would beat us"
369,00:22:39.50,00:22:39.50,all. >> And we'd look like total
370,00:22:41.38,00:22:41.38,idiots. We came up with the concept that
371,00:22:43.12,00:22:43.12,Danni was our biggest threat at this point.
372,00:22:45.17,00:22:45.17,"So, we should try to take Danni out next."
373,00:22:48.21,00:22:48.21,Danni is just like the rest of us.
374,00:22:50.42,00:22:50.42,She's gonna come on stronger by the day because the stakes
375,00:22:52.96,00:22:52.96,are higher. >> Nobody promised her anything.
376,00:22:55.88,00:22:55.88,"We'll bring it up to Rafe, see how he feels."
377,00:22:58.46,00:22:58.46,>> I would think that Rafe would understand someone as a physical
378,00:23:00.71,00:23:00.71,"threat. >> Yeah, well, Rafe's a smart"
379,00:23:02.29,00:23:02.29,kid. Hope he finally gets it.
380,00:23:16.88,00:23:16.88,">> Hi, guys! >> Oh, my God!"
381,00:23:19.62,00:23:19.62,( indistinct chatter ) >> So early.
382,00:23:25.50,00:23:25.50,">> Cindy, did you drive it okay? >> Yeah, it drives so nice."
383,00:23:29.17,00:23:29.17,">> It drives so nice. >> Like, I can't believe that"
384,00:23:32.92,00:23:32.92,that car handles that way. The suspension and everything is
385,00:23:35.71,00:23:35.71,"so nice. I mean, you barely even felt the"
386,00:23:38.00,00:23:38.00,"rocks. I was just like, this is like a"
387,00:23:41.12,00:23:41.12,freaking luxury vehicle. >> I really never expected I
388,00:23:45.04,00:23:45.04,would own a brand-new vehicle in my entire life.
389,00:23:47.42,00:23:47.42,"Like, every time I go out to get in it, anybody who's with me,"
390,00:23:51.33,00:23:51.33,"I'm just going to be, like, you like my car?"
391,00:23:54.71,00:23:54.71,"I love the way the tires are shaped, and I love the way the"
392,00:23:58.33,00:23:58.33,taillights look. >> That's why I asked.
393,00:24:00.50,00:24:00.50,"It's cute that Cindy is really, really excited about the"
394,00:24:03.71,00:24:03.71,"car, but at the same time, I think it's grating on people a"
395,00:24:06.12,00:24:06.12,little bit. >> I've never really never for
396,00:24:08.92,00:24:08.92,once ever in my life ever considered that I would own a
397,00:24:11.79,00:24:11.79,"brand-new vehicle. I mean, the thought never"
398,00:24:14.12,00:24:14.12,crossed my mind. >> You can only hear so much
399,00:24:16.38,00:24:16.38,"about something that everyone else could have had, too."
400,00:24:19.42,00:24:19.42,>> You never expect stuff like that.
401,00:24:21.25,00:24:21.25,">> Like, if you can't read that body language, um, no one"
402,00:24:25.46,00:24:25.46,"listening when you're talking about the car, you know, it's"
403,00:24:29.25,00:24:29.25,probably best to stop that talk. >> There's no guarantee that
404,00:24:31.92,00:24:31.92,you're going to win. I really don't think winning a
405,00:24:34.25,00:24:34.25,car has anything to do with it. >> No.
406,00:24:36.25,00:24:36.25,">> You have a brand-new, nice- smelling vehicle."
407,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,>> It was so unexpected. They were excited to hear about
408,00:24:40.67,00:24:40.67,the car. Everyone seemed to think that
409,00:24:43.12,00:24:43.12,choosing the car and the reward for myself was the right thing
410,00:24:46.08,00:24:46.08,"to do. No one, um, seemed to have any"
411,00:24:49.17,00:24:49.17,qualms about it at all. >> She's so happy about the car.
412,00:24:52.67,00:24:52.67,"I mean, that's all she talked about was the car."
413,00:24:55.08,00:24:55.08,>> Really? >> She felt bad.
414,00:24:56.42,00:24:56.42,"Now, I'm like, why are you going to feel bad?"
415,00:24:59.00,00:24:59.00,Why are you going to give the car up?
416,00:25:01.12,00:25:01.12,">> Yeah, well, see, Danni and I both thought that she was."
417,00:25:04.79,00:25:04.79,>> So did I. She was considering it.
418,00:25:07.42,00:25:07.42,>> I... I didn't-- Danni and I both thought there wasn't any
419,00:25:11.08,00:25:11.08,other option than to give up the car.
420,00:25:13.75,00:25:13.75,">> What do you mean? >> Like, if they had asked me"
421,00:25:16.62,00:25:16.62,"that, like, there's no way I would have kept it."
422,00:25:19.33,00:25:19.33,>> Really? Why? >> No way.
423,00:25:21.21,00:25:21.21,Because it's like four of you guys could have a car.
424,00:25:24.04,00:25:24.04,>> You thought you had to give it up?
425,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,">> Not that you had to, but I just... I would have."
426,00:25:28.33,00:25:28.33,>> Really?! I didn't think anybody would
427,00:25:30.62,00:25:30.62,have. That's a tough decision.
428,00:25:32.33,00:25:32.33,>> Yeah. >> I don't think I would have
429,00:25:34.25,00:25:34.25,"done it. I could not believe he said, ""I"
430,00:25:37.12,00:25:37.12,"would have gave the other four the car."""
431,00:25:39.08,00:25:39.08,"I was like... no way. Seriously, sometimes I just feel"
432,00:25:43.33,00:25:43.33,like Rafe does try to play the martyr a little bit.
433,00:25:45.42,00:25:45.42,That was like the first time Rafe and I have ever disagreed
434,00:25:48.04,00:25:48.04,"the whole game. Wow, that's surprising."
435,00:25:50.79,00:25:50.79,I don't think I would have. >> I would have in like a
436,00:25:53.12,00:25:53.12,heartbeat. >> But a car when you don't have
437,00:25:55.12,00:25:55.12,"one? Lydia, you would have given up"
438,00:25:58.42,00:25:58.42,the car? >> I think Cindy made the right
439,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,choice. >> Yeah.
440,00:26:03.96,00:26:03.96,>> The only thing that I was thinking about is the fact that
441,00:26:07.12,00:26:07.12,"you can give four other people a car, and it seems like"
442,00:26:09.42,00:26:09.42,everyone else was thinking about what they could have.
443,00:26:12.46,00:26:12.46,"So, it kind of made me think like, am I playing this game too"
444,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,"nicely right now? Like, should I be playing this"
445,00:26:18.79,00:26:18.79,game a little bit harder than I am?
446,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,"( bird squawking ) >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
447,00:26:35.54,00:26:35.54,"Hello, everybody. >> Hello."
448,00:26:38.00,00:26:38.00,">> So, tell me about the reward, Cindy."
449,00:26:40.08,00:26:40.08,How did it go? >> It was overwhelming.
450,00:26:42.08,00:26:42.08,"We had, you know, some yummy food, and all the while that"
451,00:26:45.79,00:26:45.79,"we're cooking and eating, I could see out of the"
452,00:26:47.83,00:26:47.83,"corner of my eye that car sitting there, and to know how"
453,00:26:50.08,00:26:50.08,awesome it is and that it's mine.
454,00:26:53.12,00:26:53.12,">> PROBST: All right, you ready to get to today's immunity"
455,00:26:55.42,00:26:55.42,"challenge? First things first, give it up,"
456,00:26:58.17,00:26:58.17,"Danni. >> Oh, gosh."
457,00:27:01.29,00:27:01.29,">> Looks good on you. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
458,00:27:04.38,00:27:04.38,"back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you're"
459,00:27:08.21,00:27:08.21,"each going to begin attached to one long piece of rope, which is"
460,00:27:12.25,00:27:12.25,wound around a series of poles. Your goal is to unwind enough
461,00:27:15.83,00:27:15.83,"rope to reach the finish line. In addition, your hands and your"
462,00:27:20.38,00:27:20.38,"feet will be shackled. On my ""go,"" you'll reach for ten"
463,00:27:22.83,00:27:22.83,keys. Use one of the keys to unlock
464,00:27:25.75,00:27:25.75,"your hands. Once your hands are free, you'll"
465,00:27:28.54,00:27:28.54,move on to the next pole where you'll unlock your rope and
466,00:27:31.75,00:27:31.75,"unwind it from that pole. When you reach the last lock,"
467,00:27:36.25,00:27:36.25,you will also release one final key.
468,00:27:39.25,00:27:39.25,That will unshackle your feet. If you think you've untangled
469,00:27:42.46,00:27:42.46,"enough rope, sprint to your flag pole."
470,00:27:44.88,00:27:44.88,First person to the finish to release their tribe flag wins
471,00:27:49.25,00:27:49.25,immunity-- guaranteed a spot in the final four.
472,00:27:53.29,00:27:53.29,Clear? >> Yeah.
473,00:27:55.25,00:27:55.25,">> PROBST: We'll draw first spots, and we'll get started."
474,00:28:01.00,00:28:01.00,Here we go. For immunity and a guaranteed
475,00:28:05.08,00:28:05.08,"spot in the final four, survivors ready?"
476,00:28:09.04,00:28:09.04,Go! First thing you have to do is
477,00:28:13.12,00:28:13.12,"unlock your hands. There are ten keys, not all of"
478,00:28:17.12,00:28:17.12,them work. Steph finds her key very
479,00:28:19.54,00:28:19.54,quickly. Off to a lead.
480,00:28:22.04,00:28:22.04,Rafe right behind. Working on their second locks.
481,00:28:26.75,00:28:26.75,"Steph and Rafe. Cindy, Danni, Lydia, still"
482,00:28:31.71,00:28:31.71,searching for that first key to get their hands free.
483,00:28:34.71,00:28:34.71,Cindy's now free. She's working on her second
484,00:28:37.54,00:28:37.54,lock. Danni and Lydia still not free.
485,00:28:42.08,00:28:42.08,Steph has her second lock undone.
486,00:28:45.38,00:28:45.38,Cindy has her second lock undone.
487,00:28:48.04,00:28:48.04,Now begins the unwinding of the rope.
488,00:28:50.75,00:28:50.75,"Hopping over rope, crawling through and around a pole."
489,00:28:54.50,00:28:54.50,Cindy hopping around. It's Cindy and Steph in the
490,00:28:57.12,00:28:57.12,lead. Rafe still working on his second
491,00:28:59.29,00:28:59.29,lock. Lydia has her hands free.
492,00:29:02.12,00:29:02.12,She's at her second lock. Danni has her hands free.
493,00:29:05.08,00:29:05.08,Everybody's free. Steph with a bit of a lead.
494,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,Cindy trying to catch up. Rafe trying to get in it.
495,00:29:12.12,00:29:12.12,Steph working on her third lock. Cindy moving slowly with those
496,00:29:17.54,00:29:17.54,legs shackled. Rafe trying to catch up.
497,00:29:20.92,00:29:20.92,Danni and Lydia still behind. Steph on her third lock.
498,00:29:25.42,00:29:25.42,Cindy now working on her third lock.
499,00:29:28.08,00:29:28.08,It's Steph and Cindy. Rafe trying to get enough slack
500,00:29:31.88,00:29:31.88,to get his feet over and not fall over.
501,00:29:34.58,00:29:34.58,Lydia has her second lock undone.
502,00:29:37.04,00:29:37.04,She's back in it. Lydia moving quickly through
503,00:29:40.17,00:29:40.17,these ropes. Steph still working on her third
504,00:29:42.21,00:29:42.21,lock. Lydia is now at her third lock.
505,00:29:44.38,00:29:44.38,Cindy at her third lock. Rafe now at his third lock.
506,00:29:47.62,00:29:47.62,Danni has her second lock undone.
507,00:29:50.58,00:29:50.58,"Steph's been at her lock for a long time, trying key after key."
508,00:29:54.71,00:29:54.71,Everybody's still in it. Who's going to find the key
509,00:29:58.79,00:29:58.79,first? Steph has her lock undone.
510,00:30:03.08,00:30:03.08,Steph now moving towards her fourth and final lock.
511,00:30:06.25,00:30:06.25,Cindy has her third lock undone. She's in it.
512,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,Steph working on her fourth and final lock.
513,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,Rafe's in it. He's got his third lock undone.
514,00:30:15.12,00:30:15.12,Steph has her final lock undone. She has the final key.
515,00:30:18.62,00:30:18.62,"She's got to unshackle her feet. Steph, very close."
516,00:30:22.04,00:30:22.04,"Cindy not giving up. Steph, unshackles her feet,"
517,00:30:26.08,00:30:26.08,"Cindy racing, Rafe's back in it. Steph getting as much rope as"
518,00:30:30.83,00:30:30.83,"she can, taking off to the finish."
519,00:30:33.38,00:30:33.38,Got to reach the flag and release it.
520,00:30:36.29,00:30:36.29,Will she have enough? Steph just short.
521,00:30:42.08,00:30:42.08,"She's got a knot, trying to undo it."
522,00:30:43.88,00:30:43.88,"Cindy in her final lock. If she can get it open in time,"
523,00:30:47.46,00:30:47.46,she's got a shot. Steph did not have enough rope.
524,00:30:50.75,00:30:50.75,Still doesn't have enough rope. She's got another knot to undo.
525,00:30:54.79,00:30:54.79,Cindy fighting to get back in this.
526,00:30:57.46,00:30:57.46,Steph within a couple of feet. Will she have enough rope?
527,00:31:02.25,00:31:02.25,Guaranteed spot in the final four if she does.
528,00:31:05.83,00:31:05.83,"Cindy is at her final lock, can't get it open."
529,00:31:09.71,00:31:09.71,Steph releases the last knot. Will this be enough?
530,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,Steph wins immunity! Guaranteed spot in the final
531,00:31:17.79,00:31:17.79,"four! >> Oh, my God, finally I won"
532,00:31:22.38,00:31:22.38,something! >> PROBST: Is this your first
533,00:31:25.25,00:31:25.25,individual win? >> Yeah.
534,00:31:32.58,00:31:32.58,">> PROBST: Steph, you've come a long way from day one when you"
535,00:31:35.12,00:31:35.12,weren't sure you'd make it through the first Tribal
536,00:31:37.25,00:31:37.25,"Council. With this, you're guaranteed a"
537,00:31:40.00,00:31:40.00,"spot in the final four. >> Good job, Stephenie."
538,00:31:42.21,00:31:42.21,">> Good job, Stephenie. >> PROBST: Rafe, Cindy, Danni,"
539,00:31:45.79,00:31:45.79,"Lydia, 36 long days about to come to an end for one of you"
540,00:31:49.54,00:31:49.54,tonight. Tribal Council should be a very
541,00:31:52.25,00:31:52.25,"interesting afternoon. Grab your stuff, head back to"
542,00:31:54.75,00:31:54.75,"camp, I'll see you at Tribal. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
543,00:32:13.25,00:32:13.25,">> Way to go, Steph. Your family is going to be so"
544,00:32:15.88,00:32:15.88,proud of you. ( indistinct chatter )
545,00:32:18.62,00:32:18.62,Day 36. Mark it on your torch.
546,00:32:21.04,00:32:21.04,>> I know. >> 36.
547,00:32:22.96,00:32:22.96,">> Cindy, you were right behind me, right?"
548,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,>> Didn't get the right key. >> I finally won individual
549,00:32:29.25,00:32:29.25,"immunity. It's the most amazing feeling,"
550,00:32:32.58,00:32:32.58,"like, ever. I just guaranteed myself a spot"
551,00:32:35.79,00:32:35.79,"in the final four, and I did not think I was going to get"
552,00:32:39.12,00:32:39.12,past the first Tribal Council in the game.
553,00:33:11.79,00:33:11.79,>> I really feel like I can trust Rafe.
554,00:33:13.79,00:33:13.79,He said that he wouldn't vote for me.
555,00:33:16.38,00:33:16.38,"I don't know, you can't really trust anybody out here, but he"
556,00:33:19.50,00:33:19.50,"seems to be a pretty honest guy, so hopefully I'll be okay"
557,00:33:23.04,00:33:23.04,tonight. If I somehow win immunity or
558,00:33:29.04,00:33:29.04,"something happens, I will. >> Danni promised me she'd take"
559,00:33:33.25,00:33:33.25,me to the final two. That's a huge degree of security
560,00:33:36.08,00:33:36.08,"at the end of a crazy, crazy game."
561,00:33:41.17,00:33:41.17,I think it's definitely possible that people could want to get
562,00:33:44.21,00:33:44.21,"rid of Danni at this point, but nothing could really change my"
563,00:33:46.71,00:33:46.71,"mind about voting out Cindy. You know, the reward challenge"
564,00:33:49.54,00:33:49.54,"was the first thing where I stepped back and was, like,"
565,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,whoa. Maybe I'm not going to be
566,00:33:55.12,00:33:55.12,Cindy's biggest fan. It will come down to my powers
567,00:33:57.50,00:33:57.50,"of persuasion here, but I'm pretty sure that I can convince"
568,00:34:01.12,00:34:01.12,Steph we should vote out Cindy. >> You do?
569,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,>> For sure. You know what I mean?
570,00:34:15.83,00:34:15.83,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, but now if I vote off"
571,00:34:22.12,00:34:22.12,"Cindy, there's another vote, I'm not going to get Jamie's,"
572,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,"Judd's or Cindy's, if I get the two."
573,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,>> Wait. Did you make a deal with Cindy?
574,00:34:30.25,00:34:30.25,">> No. I mean, I told her that I was"
575,00:34:34.25,00:34:34.25,"pretty sure that we were sticking together, me and you"
576,00:34:36.21,00:34:36.21,and her. It seems like Rafe is leaning
577,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,"towards getting rid of Cindy, and I told him I felt"
578,00:34:43.17,00:34:43.17,"really bad because we already turned on Judd, and Cindy is in"
579,00:34:46.17,00:34:46.17,"our alliance, and now we're going to be turning on Cindy,"
580,00:34:48.00,00:34:48.00,"and now I don't know if this is gonna make me look worse,"
581,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,"because Cindy just took me on a reward, and this might be"
582,00:34:52.92,00:34:52.92,another vote I could lose when it comes time for the jury.
583,00:34:57.67,00:34:57.67,"But the same time, she's a huge threat in this game, and she"
584,00:35:00.33,00:35:00.33,"knows it, and she has a car at least."
585,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,"So, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know."
586,00:35:11.54,00:35:11.54,"Earlier today, I was, like... talking about, Danni, right?"
587,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"And he's like, ""I was,"" but he's like, "" We kind of think"
588,00:35:18.67,00:35:18.67,that Cindy is a bigger threat because he'd rather go up
589,00:35:22.04,00:35:22.04,"against Danni. For some reason, they think"
590,00:35:26.50,00:35:26.50,"like you're this huge threat. Right, well he knows that,"
591,00:35:32.58,00:35:32.58,but.... >> When I was on the reward
592,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,"Stephenie, we talked about eliminating Danni, but now I"
593,00:35:38.71,00:35:38.71,"know Rafe is more of a threat than anyone, so if I could get"
594,00:35:43.04,00:35:43.04,"rid of Rafe, I think that would be to my benefit."
595,00:35:45.00,00:35:45.00,"I think the girls were having a much better shot at, you know,"
596,00:35:49.04,00:35:49.04,"winning this. Danni, just so you know, voting"
597,00:35:53.88,00:35:53.88,"me out tonight, you're keeping in your strongest competitor"
598,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,right there. He's going to beat you guys in
599,00:36:00.00,00:36:00.00,all the challenges. I know you guys think I'm a
600,00:36:02.58,00:36:02.58,"threat because I've won a couple of them, but he's just going to"
601,00:36:06.79,00:36:06.79,beat you guys in the challenges and then vote you out.
602,00:36:09.17,00:36:09.17,>> I know he's the strongest. >> He can beat any of us in the
603,00:36:12.75,00:36:12.75,immunity. We already know that.
604,00:36:14.58,00:36:14.58,>> Yeah. There's nothing he can't do.
605,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,Smartest thing would be to eliminate him.
606,00:36:20.33,00:36:20.33,Have all girls go to the final four.
607,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the members of our jury.
608,00:37:01.92,00:37:01.92,"Bobby John, Jamie, Gary and Judd, voted out at the last"
609,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,"Tribal Council. Okay, it's day 36."
610,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,There are five of you left. Steph's going to be one of the
611,00:37:18.92,00:37:18.92,final four. One other person is going home
612,00:37:20.58,00:37:20.58,"tonight. Rafe, what was the mood like at"
613,00:37:23.21,00:37:23.21,camp this afternoon? >> I think everyone's feeling
614,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,"threatened right now. Except Steph, who has the"
615,00:37:29.46,00:37:29.46,"immunity idol, and there's four guys in a row on the jury, and"
616,00:37:33.04,00:37:33.04,"I'm the last guy here, so I certainly was feeling threatened"
617,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,"around camp today, too. >> PROBST: Danni, what is the"
618,00:37:39.08,00:37:39.08,"temperature back at camp, in terms of paranoia, or stick to"
619,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,"whatever plan you have? >> Well, I felt uneasy since the"
620,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,"merge because, number-wise, I've always been the odd man out, so"
621,00:37:50.33,00:37:50.33,"I always feel worried. I mean, I'm so lucky to be here,"
622,00:37:53.50,00:37:53.50,"I mean, to be if the final five. >> PROBST: Cindy, at the reward"
623,00:37:57.79,00:37:57.79,"challenge, you win the car reward, and I tell you that in"
624,00:38:01.08,00:38:01.08,"ten seasons, the person who has won that reward has never won"
625,00:38:04.46,00:38:04.46,"the game, and I give you a chance to give it up and get rid"
626,00:38:07.71,00:38:07.71,"of that curse, and also gain favor by giving everybody else a"
627,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,"car. You say no, I'm keeping it, and"
628,00:38:13.04,00:38:13.04,I'm going to win the game. Still feel confident you can
629,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"break that curse, keep that car and win the million bucks?"
630,00:38:19.21,00:38:19.21,">> Well, I don't feel like I made the wrong decision because"
631,00:38:22.04,00:38:22.04,"in this game, there's no guarantees."
632,00:38:24.12,00:38:24.12,They could very likely vote you out the next day after you gave
633,00:38:26.67,00:38:26.67,"them a car, then you're left with nothing."
634,00:38:28.92,00:38:28.92,"So I thought the curse thing was silly, that if you win the car,"
635,00:38:31.83,00:38:31.83,you're not going to win a million dollars.
636,00:38:33.79,00:38:33.79,"The curse is being a strong competitor and winning thing,"
637,00:38:36.46,00:38:36.46,"regardless of what it is, a car, a pile of cookies, whatever it"
638,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,"is. If you are a tough competitor,"
639,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,that's your curse. I don't think it has anything to
640,00:38:43.21,00:38:43.21,"do with the car. So, I'm totally content with the"
641,00:38:45.92,00:38:45.92,decision that I made. I think I made the right one.
642,00:38:48.21,00:38:48.21,>> PROBST: Who here do you think is-is competitive?
643,00:38:52.25,00:38:52.25,Who else should have a target on their back?
644,00:38:54.17,00:38:54.17,">> As far as the competition, I think Rafe is the one that"
645,00:38:57.83,00:38:57.83,people should be most concerned about.
646,00:38:59.92,00:38:59.92,"We all have seen him win challenge after challenge,"
647,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,"whether it's physical or mental, so he's good at everything, and"
648,00:39:05.33,00:39:05.33,"people like him. So, there you go."
649,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,"That's the complete package. >> PROBST: Okay, Steph, you have"
650,00:39:12.12,00:39:12.12,"the immunity necklace, just to make sure-- you're keeping it?"
651,00:39:16.00,00:39:16.00,">> I'm keeping it. >> PROBST: Okay, Steph is the"
652,00:39:18.42,00:39:18.42,only person you cannot vote for. Everybody else is fair game.
653,00:39:21.21,00:39:21.21,"It is time to vote. Cindy, you're up."
654,00:39:32.83,00:39:32.83,>> You're just a tough competitor in all walks of
655,00:39:35.38,00:39:35.38,"competition, and, dang it, people just like you."
656,00:39:47.54,00:39:47.54,">> What a terrific person you are, but you're very athletic,"
657,00:39:50.29,00:39:50.29,"very competitive and very intelligent, and I'm voting with"
658,00:39:54.29,00:39:54.29,"the tribe. >> Cindy, I've always known"
659,00:40:03.42,00:40:03.42,you'd vote whichever way the wind was blowing in a game where
660,00:40:06.83,00:40:06.83,I'm the biggest threat and it's always blowing towards me.
661,00:40:09.17,00:40:09.17,"I have to vote you out. I love you, though."
662,00:40:15.83,00:40:15.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
663,00:40:27.71,00:40:27.71,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
664,00:40:30.00,00:40:30.00,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
665,00:40:31.96,00:40:31.96,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
666,00:40:35.92,00:40:35.92,"First vote, Rafe. Cindy."
667,00:40:43.08,00:40:43.08,"One vote Cindy, one vote Rafe. Cindy."
668,00:40:51.75,00:40:51.75,"Two votes Cindy, one vote Rafe. 14th person voted out of"
669,00:40:58.17,00:40:58.17,"Survivor: Guatemala, Cindy. That's three votes."
670,00:41:00.71,00:41:00.71,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
671,00:41:03.33,00:41:03.33,>> I'll think about you guys when I see the stars through my
672,00:41:05.58,00:41:05.58,"sunroof of my new car. >> PROBST: Cindy, the tribe has"
673,00:41:12.21,00:41:12.21,spoken. It's time for you to go.
674,00:41:24.04,00:41:24.04,You've made it to the final four.
675,00:41:26.04,00:41:26.04,"Over the next three days, you will have three Tribal Councils,"
676,00:41:29.33,00:41:29.33,"two immunity challenges, one winner."
677,00:41:33.25,00:41:33.25,"Grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night."
