440,00:14:01.23,00:14:01.23,TO ELIMINATE THEM.
441,00:14:01.73,00:14:01.73,ARE YOU DOWN WITH THAT?
442,00:14:02.50,00:14:02.50,I'M DOWN.

445,00:14:06.20,00:14:06.20,I KNOW THAT.
446,00:14:08.93,00:14:08.93,I WANT TO TALK TO YOU BECAUSE
447,00:14:11.00,00:14:11.00,I KNOW THAT YOU THINK SOPHIE'S
448,00:14:13.43,00:14:13.43,NOT A THREAT.
449,00:14:14.37,00:14:14.37,"I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, BRO,"
450,00:14:16.57,00:14:16.57,I'VE BEEN WATCHING WHAT SHE SAYS
451,00:14:18.03,00:14:18.03,AT THESE TRIBALS.
452,00:14:19.53,00:14:19.53,TO ME SHE'S A THREAT.
453,00:14:21.77,00:14:21.77,I DISAGREE WITH THAT GOOP I
454,00:14:25.07,00:14:25.07,RIDE RATHER TO GO TO THE END
455,00:14:25.93,00:14:25.93,WITH BRANDON THAN SOPHIE.
456,00:14:27.83,00:14:27.83,I'M PLEADING WITH YOU TO BELIEVE
457,00:14:29.40,00:14:29.40,ME THAT SOVIETEF IS A BIGGER
458,00:14:31.10,00:14:31.10,THREAT THAN BRANDON AT THE END
459,00:14:32.37,00:14:32.37,BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
460,00:14:33.37,00:14:33.37,RESPECT THE WAY YOU PLAYED THE
461,00:14:35.50,00:14:35.50,GAME.
462,00:14:35.67,00:14:35.67,AS THE GROUP FINALLY STARTS
463,00:14:37.03,00:14:37.03,"TO SCRAMBLE, THIS IS THE FIRST"
464,00:14:38.53,00:14:38.53,TIME WE'VE REALLY HAD TO TURN ON
465,00:14:39.90,00:14:39.90,EACH OTHER AND IT'S A VERY
466,00:14:41.53,00:14:41.53,UNSETTLING FEELING.
467,00:14:45.60,00:14:45.60,HE JUST BLOWS WHICHEVER WAY THE
468,00:14:48.20,00:14:48.20,WIND BLOWS.
469,00:14:49.33,00:14:49.33,IT'S DISHEARTENING.
470,00:14:50.20,00:14:50.20,I'VE BEEN IN A VERY TIGHT
471,00:14:51.37,00:14:51.37,ALLIANCE WITH SOPHIE SINCE I
472,00:14:52.80,00:14:52.80,FOUND THE IDOL.
473,00:14:53.73,00:14:53.73,I TRIED TO REASON WITH ALBERT
474,00:14:55.07,00:14:55.07,BUT HE'S NOT HAVING ANY OF IT.
475,00:14:56.60,00:14:56.60,HE'S GOT A THING ABOUT SOPHIE.
476,00:14:58.67,00:14:58.67,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE SOVIET
477,00:15:00.53,00:15:00.53,SESMARTER THAN ALBERT.
478,00:15:02.03,00:15:02.03,THAT'S THE REASON ALBERT IS
479,00:15:03.53,00:15:03.53,INTIMIDATED BY SOPHIE.
480,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,HE'S HEARING HER AT TRIBAL.
481,00:15:06.20,00:15:06.20,SHE'S SPEAKING UP.
482,00:15:07.47,00:15:07.47,SHE'S NOT THIS QUIET LITTLE
483,00:15:09.30,00:15:09.30,MOUSE THAT HE THOUGHT SHE WAS
484,00:15:10.77,00:15:10.77,AND NOW HE'S THINKING I HAVE TO
485,00:15:12.23,00:15:12.23,GET RID OF SOPHIE.
486,00:15:13.50,00:15:13.50,"I'M THINKING MORE CLEARLY, DUDE,"
487,00:15:15.50,00:15:15.50,THAN I HAVE THOUGHT IN THE GAME.
488,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,BRANDON WILL WIN.
489,00:15:18.67,00:15:18.67,WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE END--
490,00:15:21.37,00:15:21.37,"THAT'S A TERRIBLE ARGUMENT, MAN."
491,00:15:22.70,00:15:22.70,IT REALLY IS.
492,00:15:24.00,00:15:24.00,"YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,"

496,00:15:30.53,00:15:30.53,UNDERSTAND HOW THE JURY WORKS.
497,00:15:32.07,00:15:32.07,IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ANIMAL.
498,00:15:36.20,00:15:36.20,TOTALLY DIFFERENT ANIMAL.
499,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,WHAT'S UP?

506,00:15:49.60,00:15:49.60,"I MEAN, IT'S--"

510,00:15:55.60,00:15:55.60,CONVERSATION WAS.

521,00:16:11.20,00:16:11.20,"DON'T PLAY LIKE THAT, MAN."
522,00:16:13.10,00:16:13.10,BRANDON REALLY PISSED ME OFF.
523,00:16:14.33,00:16:14.33,I THINK MR. HANTZ CAME DOWN AND
524,00:16:16.30,00:16:16.30,GAVE BRANDON A SHOT OF HANTZ.
525,00:16:17.90,00:16:17.90,"ALL OF A SUDDEN, BRANDON COMES"

862,00:27:07.67,00:27:07.67,STRAIGHT-UP GUY BUT THOSE TWO
863,00:27:08.70,00:27:08.70,THINGS ARE NOT TRUE.
864,00:27:10.40,00:27:10.40,SO HE'S A LIAR.
865,00:27:11.27,00:27:11.27,LET ME TELL YOU EVERYTHING
866,00:27:13.47,00:27:13.47,THAT'S HAPPENED.
867,00:27:14.50,00:27:14.50,IT'S SO GRATIFYING SEEING
868,00:27:16.00,00:27:16.00,EVERYTHING WITH ALBERT BEING
869,00:27:17.97,00:27:17.97,EXPOSED SO NOW INSTEAD OF A
870,00:27:20.37,00:27:20.37,BLINDSIDE HE GOES OUT LOOKING
871,00:27:22.03,00:27:22.03,MORE PATHETIC THAN HE HAS THE
872,00:27:23.97,00:27:23.97,WHOLE GAME.
873,00:27:24.50,00:27:24.50,WHERE IS THE STRATEGIC VALUE--
874,00:27:26.53,00:27:26.53,"LET ME FINISH, DAMN IT."
875,00:27:28.37,00:27:28.37,"NO, BECAUSE--"
876,00:27:29.13,00:27:29.13,WHERE IS THE STRATEGIC MIND
877,00:27:30.83,00:27:30.83,NOW?
878,00:27:31.00,00:27:31.00,IT'S LIKE HE'S IN THE TOILET
879,00:27:33.23,00:27:33.23,"BOWL, AND BRANDON AND COACH AND"
880,00:27:34.50,00:27:34.50,"I AND RICK, WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE"
881,00:27:36.60,00:27:36.60,CHANCE AT FLUSHING HIM DOWN.
882,00:27:39.07,00:27:39.07,HE KEEPS KIND OF SCRAMBLING BACK
883,00:27:40.67,00:27:40.67,"UP, BUT I THINK JEFF WILL PUT"
884,00:27:42.87,00:27:42.87,THE FINAL FLUSH TONIGHT.
885,00:27:43.97,00:27:43.97,IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.
886,00:27:45.67,00:27:45.67,ALL I'M SAYING--
887,00:27:46.53,00:27:46.53,IT'S NOT WATER UNDER THE
888,00:27:47.80,00:27:47.80,BRIDGE BECAUSE TONIGHT ONE OF US
889,00:27:48.90,00:27:48.90,IS GOING TO GO HOME.
890,00:27:49.67,00:27:49.67,THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
891,00:27:50.83,00:27:50.83,"YEAH, IT IS."
892,00:27:52.27,00:27:52.27,I THINK BRANDON TOOK THE LID
893,00:27:54.40,00:27:54.40,"OFF PANDORA'S BOX TODAY FOR ME,"
894,00:27:56.27,00:27:56.27,AND I JUST GOT THROWN WITH A
895,00:28:00.20,00:28:00.20,STORM OF CRAP.
896,00:28:01.63,00:28:01.63,I I GOT A HECK OF A LOT OF
897,00:28:03.80,00:28:03.80,DAMAGE CONTROL TO DO IF I WANT
898,00:28:04.50,00:28:04.50,TO HAVE A PRAYER OF ESCAPING
899,00:28:06.13,00:28:06.13,TONIGHT'S VOTE.
900,00:28:06.63,00:28:06.63,IF I DID JUST DRAW BRANDON BACK
901,00:28:09.17,00:28:09.17,"OVER WITH ME, MAN, I'M RIGHT"
902,00:28:10.80,00:28:10.80,BACK WHERE I NEED TO BE.
903,00:28:13.80,00:28:13.80,WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT RICK
904,00:28:15.67,00:28:15.67,CALLED ME A PRINCESS YOU THINK I
905,00:28:17.90,00:28:17.90,ENJOY RICK AS A PERSON BECAUSE
906,00:28:18.90,00:28:18.90,OF THAT YOU? THINK I TOOK THAT
907,00:28:21.37,00:28:21.37,KINDLY?
908,00:28:21.53,00:28:21.53,WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE
909,00:28:22.47,00:28:22.47,SOMEBODY LIKE THAT TO THE END
910,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,WITH ME?
911,00:28:24.00,00:28:24.00,DO YOU-- DO YOU GET WHERE I'M
912,00:28:25.87,00:28:25.87,"COMING FROM WITH THAT, OR NO."
913,00:28:27.23,00:28:27.23,"YEAH, I DO."
914,00:28:29.83,00:28:29.83,I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO
915,00:28:31.60,00:28:31.60,"QLOIRS HEART ON ME, MAN."
916,00:28:32.57,00:28:32.57,I FEEL LIKE MY HEART IS CLOSED
917,00:28:34.37,00:28:34.37,"TO YOU RIGHT NOW, MAN."
918,00:28:35.63,00:28:35.63,MY HEART IS NOT CLOSED TO
919,00:28:37.40,00:28:37.40,"YOU, BROTHER."
920,00:28:38.10,00:28:38.10,I DON'T KNOW MY DECISION ABOUT
921,00:28:40.60,00:28:40.60,VOTING ALBERT.
922,00:28:41.57,00:28:41.57,HE'S LIKE A WILD CARD.
923,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,BUT I LOVE ALBERT.
924,00:28:45.00,00:28:45.00,HE'S MY FRIEND.
925,00:28:46.57,00:28:46.57,WHO AM I NOT TO FORGIVE?
926,00:28:48.60,00:28:48.60,I'M AN IMPERFECT PERSON.
927,00:28:50.87,00:28:50.87,I FORGIVE HIM.
928,00:28:51.23,00:28:51.23,YOU THINK I HAVE DEALS WITH
929,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,PEOPLE THAT WERE CREATED AND
930,00:28:53.70,00:28:53.70,BROKEN A LONG TIME AGO THAT ARE
931,00:28:55.27,00:28:55.27,NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT WE
932,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,"HAVE, MAN."
933,00:28:57.93,00:28:57.93,EVERYONE HAS LIED IN THIS
934,00:28:59.77,00:28:59.77,GAME.
935,00:29:00.27,00:29:00.27,EVERYONE.
936,00:29:00.63,00:29:00.63,EVEN MYSELF.
937,00:29:02.43,00:29:02.43,"SO I'M REALLY, REALLY, REALLY"
938,00:29:04.70,00:29:04.70,STRUGGLING TO CONSIDER TO KEEP
939,00:29:05.57,00:29:05.57,HIM IN THIS GAME.
940,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,YOU'RE-- YOU'RE MAKING ME
941,00:29:08.60,00:29:08.60,"LOOK LIKE A BAD DUDE, AND I'M"
942,00:29:10.40,00:29:10.40,NOT A BAD DUDE.
943,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,I'M NOT VOTING YOU.
944,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,I JUST MADE UP MY MIND.
945,00:29:14.43,00:29:14.43,THE REASON I DON'T WANT TO VOTE
946,00:29:16.13,00:29:16.13,ALBERT OUT IS BECAUSE I SEE HIM.
947,00:29:18.00,00:29:18.00,I SEE INSIDE OF HIM.
948,00:29:19.60,00:29:19.60,I SEE THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE HAD
949,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67,THE INTENTIONS THAT I THINK HE
950,00:29:22.90,00:29:22.90,HAD.
951,00:29:23.03,00:29:23.03,"AND I STRONGLY, STRONGLY BELIEVE"
952,00:29:26.07,00:29:26.07,THAT ALBERT DESERVES TO BE HERE.
953,00:29:28.10,00:29:28.10,"IF I HAVE TO, I'LL GIVE YOU"
954,00:29:30.23,00:29:30.23,MY IMMUNITY NECKLACE.
955,00:29:32.53,00:29:32.53,"IF I HAVE TO, I'LL GIVE ALBERT"
956,00:29:35.37,00:29:35.37,"MY IMMUNITY, AND COACH WILL NOT"
957,00:29:36.90,00:29:36.90,VOTE FOR ME.
958,00:29:38.10,00:29:38.10,ALBERT WILL NOT VOTE FOR ME.
959,00:29:39.57,00:29:39.57,AND I'LL VOTE FOR SOPHIE.
960,00:29:42.50,00:29:42.50,YOU KNOW I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND
961,00:29:45.83,00:29:45.83,HERE.
962,00:29:47.53,00:29:47.53,"AND YOU KNOW THAT BY NOW, GOD"
963,00:29:49.03,00:29:49.03,SPEAKS TO ME.
964,00:29:51.77,00:29:51.77,AND YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER
965,00:29:55.23,00:29:55.23,MAKE A DECISION TO HURT ME OR
966,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17,"YOU, MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THIS"
967,00:29:59.90,00:29:59.90,GAME.
968,00:30:00.43,00:30:00.43,( SIGHS )
969,00:30:01.93,00:30:01.93,"AND I PRAY THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS,"
970,00:30:03.70,00:30:03.70,AND WE WILL MAKE IT TO THE END
971,00:30:05.77,00:30:05.77,OF THIS GAME.
972,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,IF WE KEEP ALBERT HERE.
973,00:30:09.20,00:30:09.20,"IF I HAVE TO, I'LL GIVE HIM MY"
974,00:30:12.87,00:30:12.87,NECKLACE.
975,00:30:13.80,00:30:13.80,BUT I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER VOTE
976,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,AGAINST ME.
977,00:30:16.60,00:30:16.60,AND I KNOW YOU'D NEVER DO
978,00:30:18.20,00:30:18.20,ANYTHING OR VOTE ANY WAY THAT
979,00:30:19.90,00:30:19.90,YOU KNEW THAT I WAS GOING HOME.
980,00:30:23.47,00:30:23.47,THIS EXAMPLE WOULD BE PROBABLY
981,00:30:25.77,00:30:25.77,THE PINNACLE OF WHY WE'RE OUT
982,00:30:28.40,00:30:28.40,HERE-- FORGIVING.
983,00:30:29.40,00:30:29.40,"IF WE CAN'T FORGIVE OUR BROTHER,"
984,00:30:31.87,00:30:31.87,OUR HEAVENLY FATHER WILL NOT
985,00:30:33.37,00:30:33.37,FORGIVE US.
986,00:30:34.50,00:30:34.50,I WANT THINGS TO BE EASY AND
987,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,"SIMPLE, AND EARLIER TODAY, IT"
988,00:30:37.03,00:30:37.03,WAS KIND OF BLACK AND WHITE
989,00:30:38.37,00:30:38.37,"BECAUSE WE HAD ONE MAN, ALBERT,"
990,00:30:40.10,00:30:40.10,THAT HAD JUST COMPLETELY LIED TO
991,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,THE CAMP.
992,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,SO IT'S JUSTIFICATION THAT HE
993,00:30:45.53,00:30:45.53,GOES.
994,00:30:45.70,00:30:45.70,BUT THEN BRANDON BRINGS IN
995,00:30:47.47,00:30:47.47,"FORGIVENESS, AND THEN THE"
996,00:30:48.67,00:30:48.67,IMMUNITY NECKLACE.
997,00:30:49.67,00:30:49.67,AND IT MAKES IT SO HARD TO
998,00:30:52.80,00:30:52.80,DETERMINE RIGHT FROM WRONG.
999,00:30:53.93,00:30:53.93,IT MAKES IT SO HARD TO FIGURE
1000,00:30:56.87,00:30:56.87,"OUT WHO SHOULD GO, WHO DESERVES"
1001,00:31:00.77,00:31:00.77,"TO STAY, WHICH ALLIANCE I SHOULD"
1002,00:31:02.83,00:31:02.83,"BE IN, WHICH PEOPLE I CAN TRUST."
1003,00:31:06.57,00:31:06.57,WHO ARE YOU GUYS WRITING DOWN?
1004,00:31:08.60,00:31:08.60,SOPHIE.
1005,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,I JUST HONESTLY BELIEVE THIS IS
1006,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO.
1007,00:31:12.97,00:31:12.97,"REMEMBER NOW, THIS IS WHAT"
1008,00:31:14.17,00:31:14.17,GOD WANTS YOU TO DO.
1009,00:31:15.13,00:31:15.13,I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
1010,00:31:16.23,00:31:16.23,WHAT I NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW
1011,00:31:17.80,00:31:17.80,IS I NEED TO PRAY AND I PROMISE
1012,00:31:19.60,00:31:19.60,YOU THIS-- I WILL DO WHENEVER
1013,00:31:21.40,00:31:21.40,GOD TELLS ME TO DO.
1014,00:31:23.27,00:31:23.27,I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT TO DO
1015,00:31:25.10,00:31:25.10,WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO DO BUT I
1016,00:31:26.73,00:31:26.73,KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO
1017,00:31:28.07,00:31:28.07,"WRITE MY NAME DOWN, MAN."
1018,00:31:29.53,00:31:29.53,"OKAY, I'M GOING TO PRAY."
1019,00:31:31.40,00:31:31.40,"I BOWED DOWN, AND HUMBLY SOUGHT"
1020,00:31:34.53,00:31:34.53,GOD TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER OF WHAT
1021,00:31:36.37,00:31:36.37,I SHOULD DO TONIGHT IF BRANDON
1022,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,GIVES HIS NECKLACE TO ALBERT.
1023,00:31:41.07,00:31:41.07,I BEGGED GOD TO SPEAK TO ME LIKE
1024,00:31:43.17,00:31:43.17,HE'S NEVER SPOKEN TO ME BEFORE.
1025,00:31:44.87,00:31:44.87,I ASKED GOD TO GIVE ME THE HOLE
1026,00:31:46.97,00:31:46.97,SPIRIT OF DIVINE INTERPRETATION
1027,00:31:48.17,00:31:48.17,AND WISDOM.
1028,00:31:51.73,00:31:51.73,"I PRAYED, AND THERE WAS A NAME"
1029,00:31:55.47,00:31:55.47,IN MY HEAD OVER AND OVER AND
1030,00:31:57.07,00:31:57.07,"OVER AGAIN, AND I CLEANED THE"
1031,00:31:59.03,00:31:59.03,"SLATE, AND I ASKED FOR IT AGAIN."
1032,00:32:00.80,00:32:00.80,AND IT CAME OVER AND OVER AND
1033,00:32:02.50,00:32:02.50,OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
1034,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,MY SOUL HAS NEVER GROOEFED LIKE
1035,00:32:07.27,00:32:07.27,IT DOES IN THIS MOMENT.
1036,00:32:34.40,00:32:34.40,Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
1037,00:32:35.63,00:32:35.63,THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

1050,00:32:59.20,00:32:59.20,I WANT TO GIVE MY IMMUNITY
1051,00:33:01.60,00:33:01.60,NECKLACE UP.
1052,00:33:08.47,00:33:08.47,Jeff: OKAY.
1053,00:33:24.10,00:33:24.10,WHAT IS GOING ON?
1054,00:33:28.43,00:33:28.43,"Jeff: SO, BRANDON, I WAS"
1055,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,GOING TO ASK HOW IT FEELS TO
1056,00:33:31.37,00:33:31.37,"KNOW YOU ARE SAFE, BUT, CLEARLY,"
1057,00:33:33.63,00:33:33.63,YOU ARE NO LONGER SAFE.
1058,00:33:35.33,00:33:35.33,"WELL, I MADE A STATEMENT HERE"
1059,00:33:36.87,00:33:36.87,EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL THAT I
1060,00:33:37.90,00:33:37.90,WOULD STAY TRUE TO THE
1061,00:33:38.63,00:33:38.63,COMMITMENTS THAT I MAKE AND THAT
1062,00:33:40.77,00:33:40.77,I WOULD GIVE MY OWN PLACE IN
1063,00:33:43.07,00:33:43.07,THIS GAME UP FOR THEM.
1064,00:33:44.37,00:33:44.37,"I STARTED SOMETHING, AND I'M"
1065,00:33:45.37,00:33:45.37,GOING TO FINISH IT.

1072,00:33:52.83,00:33:52.83,ALBERT AND SAID LET'S FORM AN

1074,00:33:57.33,00:33:57.33,"WORD, IF YOU ARE EVER IN"
1075,00:33:59.20,00:33:59.20,"TROUBLE, I WILL LAY DOWN ON THE"
1076,00:34:00.80,00:34:00.80,SWORD FOR YOU?
1077,00:34:01.63,00:34:01.63,"YES, SIR."
1078,00:34:02.93,00:34:02.93,"Jeff: COACH, YOU'RE SHAKE"
1079,00:34:04.00,00:34:04.00,YOUR HEAD NO.
1080,00:34:04.33,00:34:04.33,I JUST WANT TO SET THE ROARED
1081,00:34:06.20,00:34:06.20,STRAIGHT.
1082,00:34:06.33,00:34:06.33,"A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, BRANDON"
1083,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,"WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR ALBERT,"
1084,00:34:09.63,00:34:09.63,"BUT THEN HE PRAYED ABOUT IT, AND"
1085,00:34:11.20,00:34:11.20,HE FELT LIKE HE SHOULD GIVE THE
1086,00:34:13.10,00:34:13.10,NECKLACE TO ALBERT.
1087,00:34:15.97,00:34:15.97,"Jeff: BRANDON, YOU SEEM"
1088,00:34:17.20,00:34:17.20,LIKE YOU HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE
1089,00:34:18.60,00:34:18.60,ENTIRE PLANET ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
1090,00:34:20.97,00:34:20.97,I JUST-- I'VE HAD A LOT OF
1091,00:34:22.60,00:34:22.60,TIME TO PRAY WITH ALBERT.
1092,00:34:24.10,00:34:24.10,AND I KNEW THAT IF I DIDN'T GIVE
1093,00:34:25.57,00:34:25.57,HIM THE IMMUNITY TONIGHT THAT HE
1094,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,WAS GOING TO REDEMPTION.
1095,00:34:29.20,00:34:29.20,IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN
1096,00:34:30.40,00:34:30.40,BECAUSE MY LOYALTY'S A LITTLE
1097,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50,BIT DIFFERENT.
1098,00:34:33.33,00:34:33.33,"BACK HOME, WHEN I WAS IN, YOU"
1099,00:34:35.30,00:34:35.30,"KNOW, THE WHOLE-- I GUESS YOU"
1100,00:34:36.90,00:34:36.90,"WOULD SAY GANG SCENE, WHATEVER."
1101,00:34:38.20,00:34:38.20,"A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WOULD BE,"
1102,00:34:40.90,00:34:40.90,"""BRO, I GOT YOUR BACK."
1103,00:34:42.00,00:34:42.00,"I GOT YOUR BACK."""
1104,00:34:43.47,00:34:43.47,AND I WAS REALLY WILLING TO GIVE
1105,00:34:44.87,00:34:44.87,MY LIFE FOR THESE GUYS.
1106,00:34:46.07,00:34:46.07,Jeff: SO THIS IS WHEN YOU
1107,00:34:47.27,00:34:47.27,WERE A YOUNGER KID.
1108,00:34:48.27,00:34:48.27,YEAH.
1109,00:34:49.03,00:34:49.03,Jeff: AND YOU WERE HANGING
1110,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,OUT WITH THE WRONG KIDS.
1111,00:34:50.63,00:34:50.63,"YEAH, AND I WAS ALWAYS THE"
1112,00:34:53.03,00:34:53.03,KID TO BE EXTREMELY LOYAL TO
1113,00:34:54.73,00:34:54.73,PEOPLE AND PEOPLE FREAKED OUT
1114,00:34:56.43,00:34:56.43,"ABOUT, LIKE, HE WOULD STEP IN"
1115,00:34:59.83,00:34:59.83,"FRONT OF A BULLET FOR ME, STEP"
1116,00:35:02.10,00:35:02.10,IN FRONT OF A KNIFE FOR ME.
1117,00:35:03.43,00:35:03.43,Jeff: IS THAT WHERE THE
1118,00:35:04.23,00:35:04.23,"WORD ""LOCO"" ON YOUR NEXT COMES"
1119,00:35:07.43,00:35:07.43,"FROM, THAT BRANDON IS CRAZY"
1120,00:35:08.87,00:35:08.87,ENOUGH TO DO IT?
1121,00:35:09.33,00:35:09.33,YEAH.
1122,00:35:09.90,00:35:09.90,IT'S NOT IN A NEGATIVE WAY.
1123,00:35:11.77,00:35:11.77,MY FRIENDS KNEW THAT THEY COULD
1124,00:35:13.10,00:35:13.10,TRUST ME.
1125,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,"BUT THE FUNNY PART IT IS,"
1126,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53,SOMETIMES WE'D GET INTO A HUGE
1127,00:35:17.77,00:35:17.77,BRAWL WITH ANOTHER RIVAL--
1128,00:35:19.47,00:35:19.47,WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT--
1129,00:35:20.60,00:35:20.60,AND I'D BE THE ONLY ONE STANDING
1130,00:35:22.70,00:35:22.70,THERE.
1131,00:35:22.87,00:35:22.87,Jeff: NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
1132,00:35:23.70,00:35:23.70,WOULD SHOW UP.
1133,00:35:24.30,00:35:24.30,NONE OF THEM WOULD SHOW UP.
1134,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87,Jeff: SO IT WASN'T REALLY A
1135,00:35:27.37,00:35:27.37,GANG.
1136,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93,IT WAS PEOPLE TAKING MY
1137,00:35:29.40,00:35:29.40,"LOYALTY FOR, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY"
1138,00:35:32.30,00:35:32.30,WANTED TO USE IT FOR AND THEN
1139,00:35:35.20,00:35:35.20,LEAVING ME.
1140,00:35:38.40,00:35:38.40,Jeff: IS THERE ANY CHANCE
1141,00:35:39.90,00:35:39.90,THAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT?
1142,00:35:42.10,00:35:42.10,I'D LIKE TO THINK IT WASN'T.
1143,00:35:44.07,00:35:44.07,"Jeff: BUT, BRANDON, THIS IS"
1144,00:35:45.37,00:35:45.37,YOUR COMPETITOR IN A
1145,00:35:46.80,00:35:46.80,MILLION-DOLLAR GAME.
1146,00:35:47.80,00:35:47.80,AND THE FUNNY PART ABOUT IT
1147,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"IS, I CONSIDER THESE TWO GUYS MY"
1148,00:35:51.87,00:35:51.87,BEST FRIENDS.
1149,00:35:52.40,00:35:52.40,WE HAVE A VERY SOLID CONNECTION
1150,00:35:53.83,00:35:53.83,WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF
1151,00:35:55.53,00:35:55.53,CHRIST INSIDE OF THEM.
1152,00:35:56.70,00:35:56.70,"I WAS DRAWN TO THEM, MAN."
1153,00:35:57.83,00:35:57.83,IT WASN'T BY COINCIDENCE.
1154,00:35:59.23,00:35:59.23,"Jeff: ALBERT, WHAT'S YOUR"
1155,00:36:00.63,00:36:00.63,TAKE ON THIS?
1156,00:36:01.43,00:36:01.43,IT BLOWS MY MIND BECAUSE WHEN
1157,00:36:02.90,00:36:02.90,"I GOT TO THIS GAME, SOMETHING"
1158,00:36:04.87,00:36:04.87,TOLD ME THAT THERE'S A BIGGER
1159,00:36:06.47,00:36:06.47,REASON WHY I WAS HERE.
1160,00:36:08.23,00:36:08.23,AND WHAT MAKES BRANDON'S
1161,00:36:09.93,00:36:09.93,DECISION NOT LOOK CRAZY IS
1162,00:36:11.30,00:36:11.30,BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE OUR BOND IS
1163,00:36:12.97,00:36:12.97,REAL.
1164,00:36:13.20,00:36:13.20,THAT'S THE REASON WHY I STRAYED
1165,00:36:15.63,00:36:15.63,AWAY FROM SOME OF THE EARLIER
1166,00:36:16.53,00:36:16.53,BONDS I HAD WITH A RICK OR WITH
1167,00:36:18.27,00:36:18.27,A SOPHIE BECAUSE IT WAS AT A
1168,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,DIFFERENT LEVEL SPIRITUALLY WHEN
1169,00:36:22.20,00:36:22.20,I BONDED WITH BRANDON AND WHEN I
1170,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,BONDED WITH COACH.
1171,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,Jeff: SO IS THERE A PART OF
1172,00:36:25.80,00:36:25.80,YOU AS A CHRISTIAN MAN WHO NOW
1173,00:36:28.20,00:36:28.20,WANTS TO TAKE THE NECKLACE OFF
1174,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,AND DO THE SAME THING THAT
1175,00:36:31.20,00:36:31.20,BRANDON JUST DID FOR YOU?
1176,00:36:33.20,00:36:33.20,FIREALISTICALLY BELIEVED THAT
1177,00:36:34.63,00:36:34.63,"HE'S IN TROUBLE, YES."
1178,00:36:38.10,00:36:38.10,"Jeff: SOPHIE, DO YOU"
1179,00:36:39.10,00:36:39.10,BELIEVE THAT?
1180,00:36:40.03,00:36:40.03,"UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO"
1181,00:36:42.20,00:36:42.20,BELIEVE FROM ALBERT ANYMORE.
1182,00:36:43.60,00:36:43.60,"HE'S BEEN SNEAKY, SO I'M NOT"
1183,00:36:46.07,00:36:46.07,SITTING HERE RELYING ON BLIND
1184,00:36:48.87,00:36:48.87,FAITH FROM ALBERT THEY MADE ON
1185,00:36:50.23,00:36:50.23,DAY ONE.
1186,00:36:51.23,00:36:51.23,I HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH A LOT OF
1187,00:36:52.60,00:36:52.60,PEOPLE OUT HERE AS WELL.
1188,00:36:55.20,00:36:55.20,"Jeff: RICK, EVERYTHING WAS"
1189,00:36:56.73,00:36:56.73,GOING FINE.
1190,00:36:57.73,00:36:57.73,"PIZZA'S GOING DOWN, A LITTLE"
1191,00:36:59.20,00:36:59.20,SOFT DRINK.
1192,00:36:59.60,00:36:59.60,IT WAS A GREAT LIFE.
1193,00:37:00.97,00:37:00.97,"AND THEN THE BOMB HIT, LIKE A"
1194,00:37:03.27,00:37:03.27,PACK OF WOLVES TURNING ON EACH
1195,00:37:05.57,00:37:05.57,OTHER.
1196,00:37:05.73,00:37:05.73,I'M WORRIED TO DEATH BECAUSE I'M
1197,00:37:06.83,00:37:06.83,IN TROUBLE.
1198,00:37:07.60,00:37:07.60,EATS EITHER GOING TO BE ONE OF
1199,00:37:08.70,00:37:08.70,"US, AND ONE OF US HAS A HIDDEN"
1200,00:37:10.80,00:37:10.80,"IMMUNITY, AND WE KNOW WHO IT IS,"
1201,00:37:12.20,00:37:12.20,SO WE'VE ONLY GOT THREE TO PICK
1202,00:37:14.37,00:37:14.37,FROM.
1203,00:37:14.53,00:37:14.53,IT'S OUT!
1204,00:37:15.80,00:37:15.80,Jeff:
1205,00:37:16.00,00:37:16.00,"YEAH, I BELIEVE THAT."
1206,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,"Jeff: WAIT, DID EVERYBODY--"
1207,00:37:19.20,00:37:19.20,WE ALL KNOW.
1208,00:37:20.07,00:37:20.07,Jeff: EVERYBODY KNEW.
1209,00:37:21.43,00:37:21.43,WHO HAS THE IDOL?
1210,00:37:22.87,00:37:22.87,COACH.
1211,00:37:23.27,00:37:23.27,WE KNEW.
1212,00:37:24.03,00:37:24.03,Jeff: SO IN A SENSE YOU'RE
1213,00:37:25.47,00:37:25.47,SAYING GAUZE BEAUS IF HE SMELLS
1214,00:37:27.43,00:37:27.43,ANYTHING HE MAY JUST PLAY IT
1215,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,TONIGHT OUT OF SECURITY.
1216,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,AND I REALLY BLEW THAT FOR
1217,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,HIM.
1218,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,THAT'S OKAY.
1219,00:37:33.70,00:37:33.70,IT'S BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY AT
1220,00:37:35.30,00:37:35.30,"THIS POINT, YOU KNOW WHAT I"
1221,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,MEAN.
1222,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,Jeff: AND YOU KNOW ALBERT
1223,00:37:39.47,00:37:39.47,IS SAFE.
1224,00:37:40.07,00:37:40.07,"SO IT'S YOU, BRANDON OR SOPHIE."
1225,00:37:42.77,00:37:42.77,SO I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE
1226,00:37:45.43,00:37:45.43,WOULD GIVE BRANDON BACK THE
1227,00:37:47.43,00:37:47.43,NECKLACE IF HE WAS IN TROUBLE.
1228,00:37:48.80,00:37:48.80,"Jeff: BRANDON, I'M SENSING"
1229,00:37:50.60,00:37:50.60,THAT YOU WERE ARE NOT AS SECURE
1230,00:37:52.10,00:37:52.10,AS YOU THOUGHT.
1231,00:37:52.87,00:37:52.87,I HONESTLY BELIEVE TONIGHT
1232,00:37:54.03,00:37:54.03,MIGHT BE MY NIGHT.
1233,00:37:55.07,00:37:55.07,Jeff: IS THERE ANY PART OF
1234,00:37:57.20,00:37:57.20,YOU THAT WOULD EXPECT ALBERT TO
1235,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,GIVE THAT BACK NOW?
1236,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,IT'S UP TO HIM.
1237,00:38:02.80,00:38:02.80,"Jeff: HOW DOES THAT FEEL,"
1238,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33,ALBERT?
1239,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.
1240,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,"IT'S A TON OF PRESSURE, BUT I"
1241,00:38:08.03,00:38:08.03,HOPE BRANDON FEELS COMFORTABLE
1242,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,"WITH ME, HIM, AND COACH, KNOWING"
1243,00:38:11.80,00:38:11.80,THAT HE CAN MAKE A MOVE LIKE
1244,00:38:13.30,00:38:13.30,THIS AND GO UNTOUCHED.
1245,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,"HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK HE'S"
1246,00:38:16.77,00:38:16.77,GOING HOME TONIGHT.
1247,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,SO I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE HIM THE
1248,00:38:20.00,00:38:20.00,NECKLACE BACK.
1249,00:38:23.30,00:38:23.30,"Jeff: SO SOMEHOW, COACH YOU"
1250,00:38:26.27,00:38:26.27,GOT INVOLVED IN THIS.
1251,00:38:26.87,00:38:26.87,I DID.
1252,00:38:27.73,00:38:27.73,I DON'T MIND THE RESPONSIBILITY
1253,00:38:28.93,00:38:28.93,BECAUSE I GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES
1254,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,UNTIL SAND AND I PRAYED AND GOD
1255,00:38:34.07,00:38:34.07,GAVE ME AN ANSWER ON WHAT I
1256,00:38:35.63,00:38:35.63,SHOULD DO TONIGHT AND EVERYTHING
1257,00:38:38.57,00:38:38.57,THAT IS MEANT TO BE IS SUPPOSED
1258,00:38:40.10,00:38:40.10,TO BE SO I AM AT COMET PEACE.
1259,00:38:42.30,00:38:42.30,"Jeff: BRANDON, ARE YOU AT"
1260,00:38:43.73,00:38:43.73,PEACE?
1261,00:38:43.90,00:38:43.90,"NO, SIR."
1262,00:38:44.87,00:38:44.87,Jeff: WHAT'S STIRRING
1263,00:38:47.20,00:38:47.20,INSIDE YOU?
1264,00:38:47.80,00:38:47.80,COACH IS GOING TO DO WHAT GOD
1265,00:38:49.70,00:38:49.70,"WANTS HIM TO DO, AND IF GOD"
1266,00:38:51.37,00:38:51.37,"WANTED HIM TO VOTE ME OUT, I"
1267,00:38:52.73,00:38:52.73,BELIEVE HE WOULD.
1268,00:38:57.20,00:38:57.20,"Jeff: WITH THAT, ALBERT HAS"
1269,00:38:59.87,00:38:59.87,"THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE, YOU"
1270,00:39:01.20,00:39:01.20,CANNOT VOTE FOR ALBERT.
1271,00:39:02.57,00:39:02.57,EVERYTHING ELSE HERE FAIR GAME.
1272,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
1273,00:39:05.87,00:39:05.87,"RICK, YOU'RE UP."
1274,00:39:14.97,00:39:14.97,DUMB MOVE.
1275,00:39:44.53,00:39:44.53,Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
