460,00:14:35.50,00:14:35.50,GAME.
461,00:14:35.67,00:14:35.67,AS THE GROUP FINALLY STARTS
462,00:14:37.03,00:14:37.03,"TO SCRAMBLE, THIS IS THE FIRST"
463,00:14:38.53,00:14:38.53,TIME WE'VE REALLY HAD TO TURNON

468,00:14:49.33,00:14:49.33,IT'S DISHEARTENING.
469,00:14:50.20,00:14:50.20,I'VE BEEN IN A VERY TIGHT
470,00:14:51.37,00:14:51.37,ALLIANCE WITH SOPHIE SINCE I

472,00:14:53.73,00:14:53.73,I TRIED TO REASON WITH ALBERT
473,00:14:55.07,00:14:55.07,BUT HE'S NOT HAVING ANY OF IT.

477,00:15:02.03,00:15:02.03,THAT'S THE REASON ALBERT IS
478,00:15:03.53,00:15:03.53,INTIMIDATED BY SOPHIE.
479,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,HE'S HEARING HER AT TRIBAL.
480,00:15:06.20,00:15:06.20,SHE'S SPEAKING UP.

483,00:15:10.77,00:15:10.77,AND NOW HE'S THINKING I HAVE TO
484,00:15:12.23,00:15:12.23,GET RID OF SOPHIE.
485,00:15:13.50,00:15:13.50,"I'M THINKING MORE CLEARLY,DUDE,"
486,00:15:15.50,00:15:15.50,THAN I HAVE THOUGHT IN THEGAME.

861,00:27:07.67,00:27:07.67,STRAIGHT-UP GUY BUT THOSE TWO
862,00:27:08.70,00:27:08.70,THINGS ARE NOT TRUE.
863,00:27:10.40,00:27:10.40,SO HE'S A LIAR.
864,00:27:11.27,00:27:11.27,LET ME TELL YOU EVERYTHING
865,00:27:13.47,00:27:13.47,THAT'S HAPPENED.
866,00:27:14.50,00:27:14.50,IT'S SO GRATIFYING SEEING
867,00:27:16.00,00:27:16.00,EVERYTHING WITH ALBERT BEING
868,00:27:17.97,00:27:17.97,EXPOSED SO NOW INSTEAD OF A
869,00:27:20.37,00:27:20.37,BLINDSIDE HE GOES OUT LOOKING
870,00:27:22.03,00:27:22.03,MORE PATHETIC THAN HE HAS THE
871,00:27:23.97,00:27:23.97,WHOLE GAME.
872,00:27:24.50,00:27:24.50,WHERE IS THE STRATEGIC VALUE--
873,00:27:26.53,00:27:26.53,"LET ME FINISH, DAMN IT."
874,00:27:28.37,00:27:28.37,"NO, BECAUSE--"
875,00:27:29.13,00:27:29.13,WHERE IS THE STRATEGIC MIND
876,00:27:30.83,00:27:30.83,NOW?
877,00:27:31.00,00:27:31.00,IT'S LIKE HE'S IN THE TOILET
878,00:27:33.23,00:27:33.23,"BOWL, AND BRANDON AND COACH AND"
879,00:27:34.50,00:27:34.50,"I AND RICK, WE ALL HAVE ALITTLE"
880,00:27:36.60,00:27:36.60,CHANCE AT FLUSHING HIM DOWN.
881,00:27:39.07,00:27:39.07,HE KEEPS KIND OF SCRAMBLINGBACK
882,00:27:40.67,00:27:40.67,"UP, BUT I THINK JEFF WILL PUT"
883,00:27:42.87,00:27:42.87,THE FINAL FLUSH TONIGHT.
884,00:27:43.97,00:27:43.97,IT'S WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.
885,00:27:45.67,00:27:45.67,ALL I'M SAYING--
886,00:27:46.53,00:27:46.53,IT'S NOT WATER UNDER THE
887,00:27:47.80,00:27:47.80,BRIDGE BECAUSE TONIGHT ONE OFUS
888,00:27:48.90,00:27:48.90,IS GOING TO GO HOME.
889,00:27:49.67,00:27:49.67,THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
890,00:27:50.83,00:27:50.83,"YEAH, IT IS."
891,00:27:52.27,00:27:52.27,I THINK BRANDON TOOK THE LID
892,00:27:54.40,00:27:54.40,"OFF PANDORA'S BOX TODAY FOR ME,"
893,00:27:56.27,00:27:56.27,AND I JUST GOT THROWN WITH A
894,00:28:00.20,00:28:00.20,STORM OF CRAP.
895,00:28:01.63,00:28:01.63,I I GOT A HECK OF A LOT OF
896,00:28:03.80,00:28:03.80,DAMAGE CONTROL TO DO IF I WANT
897,00:28:04.50,00:28:04.50,TO HAVE A PRAYER OF ESCAPING
898,00:28:06.13,00:28:06.13,TONIGHT'S VOTE.
899,00:28:06.63,00:28:06.63,IF I DID JUST DRAW BRANDON BACK
900,00:28:09.17,00:28:09.17,"OVER WITH ME, MAN, I'M RIGHT"
901,00:28:10.80,00:28:10.80,BACK WHERE I NEED TO BE.
902,00:28:13.80,00:28:13.80,WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT RICK
903,00:28:15.67,00:28:15.67,CALLED ME A PRINCESS YOU THINKI
904,00:28:17.90,00:28:17.90,ENJOY RICK AS A PERSON BECAUSE
905,00:28:18.90,00:28:18.90,OF THAT YOU? THINK I TOOK THAT
906,00:28:21.37,00:28:21.37,KINDLY?
907,00:28:21.53,00:28:21.53,WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE
908,00:28:22.47,00:28:22.47,SOMEBODY LIKE THAT TO THE END
909,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,WITH ME?
910,00:28:24.00,00:28:24.00,DO YOU-- DO YOU GET WHERE I'M
911,00:28:25.87,00:28:25.87,"COMING FROM WITH THAT, OR NO."
912,00:28:27.23,00:28:27.23,"YEAH, I DO."
913,00:28:29.83,00:28:29.83,I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO
914,00:28:31.60,00:28:31.60,"QLOIRS HEART ON ME, MAN."
915,00:28:32.57,00:28:32.57,I FEEL LIKE MY HEART IS CLOSED
916,00:28:34.37,00:28:34.37,"TO YOU RIGHT NOW, MAN."
917,00:28:35.63,00:28:35.63,MY HEART IS NOT CLOSED TO
918,00:28:37.40,00:28:37.40,"YOU, BROTHER."
919,00:28:38.10,00:28:38.10,I DON'T KNOW MY DECISION ABOUT
920,00:28:40.60,00:28:40.60,VOTING ALBERT.
921,00:28:41.57,00:28:41.57,HE'S LIKE A WILD CARD.
922,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,BUT I LOVE ALBERT.
923,00:28:45.00,00:28:45.00,HE'S MY FRIEND.
924,00:28:46.57,00:28:46.57,WHO AM I NOT TO FORGIVE?
925,00:28:48.60,00:28:48.60,I'M AN IMPERFECT PERSON.
926,00:28:50.87,00:28:50.87,I FORGIVE HIM.
927,00:28:51.23,00:28:51.23,YOU THINK I HAVE DEALS WITH
928,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,PEOPLE THAT WERE CREATED AND
929,00:28:53.70,00:28:53.70,BROKEN A LONG TIME AGO THAT ARE
930,00:28:55.27,00:28:55.27,NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT WE
931,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,"HAVE, MAN."
932,00:28:57.93,00:28:57.93,EVERYONE HAS LIED IN THIS
933,00:28:59.77,00:28:59.77,GAME.
934,00:29:00.27,00:29:00.27,EVERYONE.
935,00:29:00.63,00:29:00.63,EVEN MYSELF.
936,00:29:02.43,00:29:02.43,"SO I'M REALLY, REALLY, REALLY"
937,00:29:04.70,00:29:04.70,STRUGGLING TO CONSIDER TO KEEP
938,00:29:05.57,00:29:05.57,HIM IN THIS GAME.
939,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,YOU'RE-- YOU'RE MAKING ME
940,00:29:08.60,00:29:08.60,"LOOK LIKE A BAD DUDE, AND I'M"
941,00:29:10.40,00:29:10.40,NOT A BAD DUDE.
942,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,I'M NOT VOTING YOU.
943,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,I JUST MADE UP MY MIND.
944,00:29:14.43,00:29:14.43,THE REASON I DON'T WANT TO VOTE
945,00:29:16.13,00:29:16.13,ALBERT OUT IS BECAUSE I SEEHIM.
946,00:29:18.00,00:29:18.00,I SEE INSIDE OF HIM.
947,00:29:19.60,00:29:19.60,I SEE THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE HAD
948,00:29:21.67,00:29:21.67,THE INTENTIONS THAT I THINK HE
949,00:29:22.90,00:29:22.90,HAD.
950,00:29:23.03,00:29:23.03,"AND I STRONGLY, STRONGLYBELIEVE"
951,00:29:26.07,00:29:26.07,THAT ALBERT DESERVES TO BEHERE.
952,00:29:28.10,00:29:28.10,"IF I HAVE TO, I'LL GIVE YOU"
953,00:29:30.23,00:29:30.23,MY IMMUNITY NECKLACE.
954,00:29:32.53,00:29:32.53,"IF I HAVE TO, I'LL GIVE ALBERT"
955,00:29:35.37,00:29:35.37,"MY IMMUNITY, AND COACH WILL NOT"
956,00:29:36.90,00:29:36.90,VOTE FOR ME.
957,00:29:38.10,00:29:38.10,ALBERT WILL NOT VOTE FOR ME.
958,00:29:39.57,00:29:39.57,AND I'LL VOTE FOR SOPHIE.
959,00:29:42.50,00:29:42.50,YOU KNOW I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND
960,00:29:45.83,00:29:45.83,HERE.
961,00:29:47.53,00:29:47.53,"AND YOU KNOW THAT BY NOW, GOD"
962,00:29:49.03,00:29:49.03,SPEAKS TO ME.
963,00:29:51.77,00:29:51.77,AND YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER
964,00:29:55.23,00:29:55.23,MAKE A DECISION TO HURT ME OR
965,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17,"YOU, MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THIS"
966,00:29:59.90,00:29:59.90,GAME.
967,00:30:00.43,00:30:00.43,( SIGHS )
968,00:30:01.93,00:30:01.93,"AND I PRAY THAT YOU ACCEPTTHIS,"
969,00:30:03.70,00:30:03.70,AND WE WILL MAKE IT TO THE END
970,00:30:05.77,00:30:05.77,OF THIS GAME.
971,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,IF WE KEEP ALBERT HERE.
972,00:30:09.20,00:30:09.20,"IF I HAVE TO, I'LL GIVE HIM MY"
973,00:30:12.87,00:30:12.87,NECKLACE.
974,00:30:13.80,00:30:13.80,BUT I KNOW YOU'LL NEVER VOTE
975,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,AGAINST ME.
976,00:30:16.60,00:30:16.60,AND I KNOW YOU'D NEVER DO
977,00:30:18.20,00:30:18.20,ANYTHING OR VOTE ANY WAY THAT
978,00:30:19.90,00:30:19.90,YOU KNEW THAT I WAS GOING HOME.
979,00:30:23.47,00:30:23.47,THIS EXAMPLE WOULD BE PROBABLY
980,00:30:25.77,00:30:25.77,THE PINNACLE OF WHY WE'RE OUT
981,00:30:28.40,00:30:28.40,HERE-- FORGIVING.
982,00:30:29.40,00:30:29.40,"IF WE CAN'T FORGIVE OURBROTHER,"
983,00:30:31.87,00:30:31.87,OUR HEAVENLY FATHER WILL NOT
984,00:30:33.37,00:30:33.37,FORGIVE US.
985,00:30:34.50,00:30:34.50,I WANT THINGS TO BE EASY AND
986,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,"SIMPLE, AND EARLIER TODAY, IT"
987,00:30:37.03,00:30:37.03,WAS KIND OF BLACK AND WHITE
988,00:30:38.37,00:30:38.37,"BECAUSE WE HAD ONE MAN, ALBERT,"
989,00:30:40.10,00:30:40.10,THAT HAD JUST COMPLETELY LIEDTO
990,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,THE CAMP.
991,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,SO IT'S JUSTIFICATION THAT HE
992,00:30:45.53,00:30:45.53,GOES.
993,00:30:45.70,00:30:45.70,BUT THEN BRANDON BRINGS IN
994,00:30:47.47,00:30:47.47,"FORGIVENESS, AND THEN THE"
995,00:30:48.67,00:30:48.67,IMMUNITY NECKLACE.
996,00:30:49.67,00:30:49.67,AND IT MAKES IT SO HARD TO
997,00:30:52.80,00:30:52.80,DETERMINE RIGHT FROM WRONG.
998,00:30:53.93,00:30:53.93,IT MAKES IT SO HARD TO FIGURE
999,00:30:56.87,00:30:56.87,"OUT WHO SHOULD GO, WHO DESERVES"
1000,00:31:00.77,00:31:00.77,"TO STAY, WHICH ALLIANCE ISHOULD"
1001,00:31:02.83,00:31:02.83,"BE IN, WHICH PEOPLE I CANTRUST."
1002,00:31:06.57,00:31:06.57,WHO ARE YOU GUYS WRITING DOWN?
1003,00:31:08.60,00:31:08.60,SOPHIE.
1004,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,I JUST HONESTLY BELIEVE THIS IS
1005,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO.
1006,00:31:12.97,00:31:12.97,"REMEMBER NOW, THIS IS WHAT"
1007,00:31:14.17,00:31:14.17,GOD WANTS YOU TO DO.
1008,00:31:15.13,00:31:15.13,I'LL TELL YOU WHAT--
1009,00:31:16.23,00:31:16.23,WHAT I NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW
1010,00:31:17.80,00:31:17.80,IS I NEED TO PRAY AND I PROMISE
1011,00:31:19.60,00:31:19.60,YOU THIS-- I WILL DO WHENEVER
1012,00:31:21.40,00:31:21.40,GOD TELLS ME TO DO.
1013,00:31:23.27,00:31:23.27,I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT TO DO
1014,00:31:25.10,00:31:25.10,WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO DO BUT I
1015,00:31:26.73,00:31:26.73,KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO
1016,00:31:28.07,00:31:28.07,"WRITE MY NAME DOWN, MAN."
1017,00:31:29.53,00:31:29.53,"OKAY, I'M GOING TO PRAY."
1018,00:31:31.40,00:31:31.40,"I BOWED DOWN, AND HUMBLY SOUGHT"
1019,00:31:34.53,00:31:34.53,GOD TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER OFWHAT
1020,00:31:36.37,00:31:36.37,I SHOULD DO TONIGHT IF BRANDON
1021,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,GIVES HIS NECKLACE TO ALBERT.
1022,00:31:41.07,00:31:41.07,I BEGGED GOD TO SPEAK TO MELIKE
1023,00:31:43.17,00:31:43.17,HE'S NEVER SPOKEN TO ME BEFORE.
1024,00:31:44.87,00:31:44.87,I ASKED GOD TO GIVE ME THE HOLE
1025,00:31:46.97,00:31:46.97,SPIRIT OF DIVINE INTERPRETATION
1026,00:31:48.17,00:31:48.17,AND WISDOM.
1027,00:31:51.73,00:31:51.73,"I PRAYED, AND THERE WAS A NAME"
1028,00:31:55.47,00:31:55.47,IN MY HEAD OVER AND OVER AND
1029,00:31:57.07,00:31:57.07,"OVER AGAIN, AND I CLEANED THE"
1030,00:31:59.03,00:31:59.03,"SLATE, AND I ASKED FOR ITAGAIN."
1031,00:32:00.80,00:32:00.80,AND IT CAME OVER AND OVER AND
1032,00:32:02.50,00:32:02.50,OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
1033,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,MY SOUL HAS NEVER GROOEFED LIKE
1034,00:32:07.27,00:32:07.27,IT DOES IN THIS MOMENT.

1081,00:34:06.33,00:34:06.33,"A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, BRANDON"
1082,00:34:07.77,00:34:07.77,"WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR ALBERT,"
1083,00:34:09.63,00:34:09.63,"BUT THEN HE PRAYED ABOUT IT,AND"
1084,00:34:11.20,00:34:11.20,HE FELT LIKE HE SHOULD GIVE THE
1085,00:34:13.10,00:34:13.10,NECKLACE TO ALBERT.
1086,00:34:15.97,00:34:15.97,"Jeff: BRANDON, YOU SEEM"
1087,00:34:17.20,00:34:17.20,LIKE YOU HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE

1090,00:34:22.60,00:34:22.60,TIME TO PRAY WITH ALBERT.
1091,00:34:24.10,00:34:24.10,AND I KNEW THAT IF I DIDN'TGIVE

1093,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,WAS GOING TO REDEMPTION.
1094,00:34:29.20,00:34:29.20,IT'S REALLY HARD TO EXPLAIN
1095,00:34:30.40,00:34:30.40,BECAUSE MY LOYALTY'S A LITTLE
1096,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50,BIT DIFFERENT.
1097,00:34:33.33,00:34:33.33,"BACK HOME, WHEN I WAS IN, YOU"
1098,00:34:35.30,00:34:35.30,"KNOW, THE WHOLE-- I GUESS YOU"

1109,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,OUT WITH THE WRONG KIDS.
1110,00:34:50.63,00:34:50.63,"YEAH, AND I WAS ALWAYS THE"
1111,00:34:53.03,00:34:53.03,KID TO BE EXTREMELY LOYAL TO

1120,00:35:09.33,00:35:09.33,YEAH.
1121,00:35:09.90,00:35:09.90,IT'S NOT IN A NEGATIVE WAY.
1122,00:35:11.77,00:35:11.77,MY FRIENDS KNEW THAT THEY COULD
1123,00:35:13.10,00:35:13.10,TRUST ME.
1124,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,"BUT THE FUNNY PART IT IS,"
1125,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53,SOMETIMES WE'D GET INTO A HUGE
1126,00:35:17.77,00:35:17.77,BRAWL WITH ANOTHER RIVAL--
1127,00:35:19.47,00:35:19.47,WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT--

1130,00:35:22.87,00:35:22.87,Jeff: NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
1131,00:35:23.70,00:35:23.70,WOULD SHOW UP.
1132,00:35:24.30,00:35:24.30,NONE OF THEM WOULD SHOW UP.
1133,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87,Jeff: SO IT WASN'T REALLY A
1134,00:35:27.37,00:35:27.37,GANG.
1135,00:35:27.93,00:35:27.93,IT WAS PEOPLE TAKING MY
1136,00:35:29.40,00:35:29.40,"LOYALTY FOR, YOU KNOW, WHATTHEY"
1137,00:35:32.30,00:35:32.30,WANTED TO USE IT FOR AND THEN
1138,00:35:35.20,00:35:35.20,LEAVING ME.
1139,00:35:38.40,00:35:38.40,Jeff: IS THERE ANY CHANCE
1140,00:35:39.90,00:35:39.90,THAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT?
1141,00:35:42.10,00:35:42.10,I'D LIKE TO THINK IT WASN'T.
1142,00:35:44.07,00:35:44.07,"Jeff: BUT, BRANDON, THIS IS"
1143,00:35:45.37,00:35:45.37,YOUR COMPETITOR IN A
1144,00:35:46.80,00:35:46.80,MILLION-DOLLAR GAME.
1145,00:35:47.80,00:35:47.80,AND THE FUNNY PART ABOUT IT
1146,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"IS, I CONSIDER THESE TWO GUYSMY"
1147,00:35:51.87,00:35:51.87,BEST FRIENDS.
1148,00:35:52.40,00:35:52.40,WE HAVE A VERY SOLID CONNECTION
1149,00:35:53.83,00:35:53.83,WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF
1150,00:35:55.53,00:35:55.53,CHRIST INSIDE OF THEM.
1151,00:35:56.70,00:35:56.70,"I WAS DRAWN TO THEM, MAN."
1152,00:35:57.83,00:35:57.83,IT WASN'T BY COINCIDENCE.
1153,00:35:59.23,00:35:59.23,"Jeff: ALBERT, WHAT'S YOUR"
1154,00:36:00.63,00:36:00.63,TAKE ON THIS?
1155,00:36:01.43,00:36:01.43,IT BLOWS MY MIND BECAUSE WHEN
1156,00:36:02.90,00:36:02.90,"I GOT TO THIS GAME, SOMETHING"
1157,00:36:04.87,00:36:04.87,TOLD ME THAT THERE'S A BIGGER
1158,00:36:06.47,00:36:06.47,REASON WHY I WAS HERE.
1159,00:36:08.23,00:36:08.23,AND WHAT MAKES BRANDON'S
1160,00:36:09.93,00:36:09.93,DECISION NOT LOOK CRAZY IS
1161,00:36:11.30,00:36:11.30,BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE OUR BONDIS
1162,00:36:12.97,00:36:12.97,REAL.
1163,00:36:13.20,00:36:13.20,THAT'S THE REASON WHY I STRAYED
1164,00:36:15.63,00:36:15.63,AWAY FROM SOME OF THE EARLIER
1165,00:36:16.53,00:36:16.53,BONDS I HAD WITH A RICK OR WITH
1166,00:36:18.27,00:36:18.27,A SOPHIE BECAUSE IT WAS AT A
1167,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,DIFFERENT LEVEL SPIRITUALLYWHEN
1168,00:36:22.20,00:36:22.20,I BONDED WITH BRANDON AND WHENI
1169,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,BONDED WITH COACH.
1170,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,Jeff: SO IS THERE A PART OF
1171,00:36:25.80,00:36:25.80,YOU AS A CHRISTIAN MAN WHO NOW
1172,00:36:28.20,00:36:28.20,WANTS TO TAKE THE NECKLACE OFF
1173,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,AND DO THE SAME THING THAT
1174,00:36:31.20,00:36:31.20,BRANDON JUST DID FOR YOU?
1175,00:36:33.20,00:36:33.20,FIREALISTICALLY BELIEVED THAT
1176,00:36:34.63,00:36:34.63,"HE'S IN TROUBLE, YES."
1177,00:36:38.10,00:36:38.10,"Jeff: SOPHIE, DO YOU"
1178,00:36:39.10,00:36:39.10,BELIEVE THAT?
1179,00:36:40.03,00:36:40.03,"UH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO"
1180,00:36:42.20,00:36:42.20,BELIEVE FROM ALBERT ANYMORE.

1202,00:37:14.53,00:37:14.53,IT'S OUT!
1203,00:37:15.80,00:37:15.80,Jeff:

1214,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,TONIGHT OUT OF SECURITY.
1215,00:37:29.47,00:37:29.47,AND I REALLY BLEW THAT FOR
1216,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,HIM.
1217,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,THAT'S OKAY.
1218,00:37:33.70,00:37:33.70,IT'S BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY AT

1224,00:37:42.77,00:37:42.77,SO I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE IF HE
1225,00:37:45.43,00:37:45.43,WOULD GIVE BRANDON BACK THE
1226,00:37:47.43,00:37:47.43,NECKLACE IF HE WAS IN TROUBLE.
1227,00:37:48.80,00:37:48.80,"Jeff: BRANDON, I'M SENSING"
1228,00:37:50.60,00:37:50.60,THAT YOU WERE ARE NOT AS SECURE

1235,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,IT'S UP TO HIM.
1236,00:38:02.80,00:38:02.80,"Jeff: HOW DOES THAT FEEL,"
1237,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33,ALBERT?
1238,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.
1239,00:38:06.33,00:38:06.33,"IT'S A TON OF PRESSURE, BUT I"
1240,00:38:08.03,00:38:08.03,HOPE BRANDON FEELS COMFORTABLE
1241,00:38:09.40,00:38:09.40,"WITH ME, HIM, AND COACH,KNOWING"
1242,00:38:11.80,00:38:11.80,THAT HE CAN MAKE A MOVE LIKE

1251,00:38:27.73,00:38:27.73,I DON'T MIND THE RESPONSIBILITY
1252,00:38:28.93,00:38:28.93,BECAUSE I GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES
1253,00:38:31.87,00:38:31.87,UNTIL SAND AND I PRAYED AND GOD
1254,00:38:34.07,00:38:34.07,GAVE ME AN ANSWER ON WHAT I

1266,00:38:52.73,00:38:52.73,BELIEVE HE WOULD.
