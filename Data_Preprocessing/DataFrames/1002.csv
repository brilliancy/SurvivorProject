1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:03.12,00:00:03.12,"Survivor: In the island nation of Palau,"
3,00:00:07.29,00:00:07.29,20 new castaways began their adventure with a big twist.
4,00:00:11.46,00:00:11.46,There are two immunity necklaces-- one for the first
5,00:00:15.17,00:00:15.17,"woman, one for the first man-- who can get to shore and claim"
6,00:00:19.08,00:00:19.08,them. Go!
7,00:00:21.50,00:00:21.50,"With no other information to guide them, the race was on."
8,00:00:28.12,00:00:28.12,Ian and Jolanda were the first to claim the necklaces.
9,00:00:31.17,00:00:31.17,>> Whoo! Good job! >> We're not a tribe.
10,00:00:33.21,00:00:33.21,We don't have our buffs. We don't have a clue what's
11,00:00:35.96,00:00:35.96,"happening next. >> All right, see if we"
12,00:00:38.12,00:00:38.12,can get this going. >> PROBST: With all 20 on one
13,00:00:41.12,00:00:41.12,"beach, and no fire to boil water, things got even worse"
14,00:00:43.21,00:00:43.21,"on day two... All right, Ian, take"
15,00:00:45.46,00:00:45.46,"a spot right over here, Jolanda right over here."
16,00:00:47.67,00:00:47.67,...when the survivors finally learned the value
17,00:00:49.58,00:00:49.58,of the immunity necklaces. We're going to divide
18,00:00:51.79,00:00:51.79,into two tribes with nine members each.
19,00:00:53.62,00:00:53.62,There are 20 of you. Two people will be sent home.
20,00:00:56.12,00:00:56.12,(survivors groaning) Ian and Jolanda made the first
21,00:00:59.46,00:00:59.46,of the schoolyard picks. >> Katie.
22,00:01:02.62,00:01:02.62,>> Bobby Jon. >> PROBST: And the two tribes
23,00:01:05.17,00:01:05.17,"were chosen, one by one. >> Willard."
24,00:01:07.42,00:01:07.42,>> PROBST: Willard was the last member picked for the older
25,00:01:09.75,00:01:09.75,Koror Tribe. >> Angie.
26,00:01:11.46,00:01:11.46,>> PROBST: And Angie was the last picked for the younger
27,00:01:14.50,00:01:14.50,Ulong Tribe. Jonathan and Wanda were out.
28,00:01:18.25,00:01:18.25,"(cheering) >> Go get 'em, Wanda!"
29,00:01:21.21,00:01:21.21,">> I was really, really, really sad."
30,00:01:24.04,00:01:24.04,I'm going to wipe my tears. That's in the past.
31,00:01:27.08,00:01:27.08,It's a whole new game. >> PROBST: All right.
32,00:01:29.21,00:01:29.21,"Let's hand out the buffs. Koror, you will wear brown."
33,00:01:33.42,00:01:33.42,You guys are Ulong. You'll wear blue.
34,00:01:38.62,00:01:38.62,Survivors ready. Go!
35,00:01:40.62,00:01:40.62,"At the challenge, the tribes competed for immunity"
36,00:01:43.42,00:01:43.42,and whatever survival items they chose to take.
37,00:01:46.83,00:01:46.83,The older Koror tribe took only the flint to make fire...
38,00:01:51.71,00:01:51.71,>> Come on! We got to go! >> PROBST: ...while Ulong
39,00:01:55.83,00:01:55.83,struggled with more supplies. Koror is up and over.
40,00:01:58.12,00:01:58.12,>> Let's go! >> PROBST: Koror's decision to
41,00:02:00.17,00:02:00.17,travel light secured them victory...
42,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,Koror wins immunity and reward! ...and earned them the right
43,00:02:05.83,00:02:05.83,to choose a campsite. You can either go back
44,00:02:07.96,00:02:07.96,to what you know or you can start fresh.
45,00:02:10.04,00:02:10.04,>> New adventure. >> PROBST: You're going to
46,00:02:11.75,00:02:11.75,take your chances. >> We're going to take our
47,00:02:13.75,00:02:13.75,chances. >> PROBST: But on the way
48,00:02:15.92,00:02:15.92,"to their new beach, disaster struck the winning Koror tribe."
49,00:02:20.00,00:02:20.00,">> Oh, my God! >> All of the supplies to make"
50,00:02:22.79,00:02:22.79,"fire went straight down. It was just like, ""Did this"
51,00:02:25.04,00:02:25.04,"really happen?"" >> We're in a worse scenario"
52,00:02:28.75,00:02:28.75,"than we originally had. >> PROBST: Back at Ulong,"
53,00:02:31.75,00:02:31.75,Angie knew she was a target going into Tribal Council.
54,00:02:35.12,00:02:35.12,>> You don't think I remember exactly the order in which
55,00:02:37.92,00:02:37.92,we got picked for tribes? The only reason we lost the
56,00:02:40.21,00:02:40.21,challenge is 'cause we didn't leave soon enough.
57,00:02:42.62,00:02:42.62,>> PROBST: But Stephenie felt Jolanda had held them back
58,00:02:44.83,00:02:44.83,"at the challenge. >> We made a dumb mistake,"
59,00:02:46.71,00:02:46.71,"and it's because of one person, I feel."
60,00:02:49.25,00:02:49.25,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Angie received three votes..."
61,00:02:52.08,00:02:52.08,First person voted out of Survivor: Palau...
62,00:02:55.46,00:02:55.46,...but it was Jolanda who was voted out.
63,00:02:57.29,00:02:57.29,"Jolanda, the tribe has spoken. 17 are left."
64,00:03:01.71,00:03:01.71,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Another day in paradise.
65,00:04:29.71,00:04:29.71,">> Today we won immunity, which was fabulous."
66,00:04:32.42,00:04:32.42,"We won a great reward which was the flint,"
67,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,"and up until that point, everything was just wonderful."
68,00:04:39.04,00:04:39.04,"And of course, then there was a turn of events with the"
69,00:04:40.54,00:04:40.54,"capsizing of the boat, and... the flint is at the"
70,00:04:43.83,00:04:43.83,"bottom of the ocean, so we can't even get fire."
71,00:04:49.08,00:04:49.08,">> It's a bummer and a buzz kill, but like we said,"
72,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,"it was just like a car accident, and we just got"
73,00:04:53.25,00:04:53.25,to get back from it. Get around the shock of it.
74,00:04:55.29,00:04:55.29,(squeaking) (Janu shrieks)
75,00:05:01.62,00:05:01.62,"(shrieking) >> Oh, my God, there were three!"
76,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,">> There's a lot of them... >> When I first saw the rats,"
77,00:05:10.71,00:05:10.71,"oh, my God, saw three of them, and they were just"
78,00:05:14.21,00:05:14.21,(trills tongue) going to town. (gasps)
79,00:05:17.08,00:05:17.08,"I hear them. Like, they're right behind"
80,00:05:19.08,00:05:19.08,there. (squeaking)
81,00:05:20.83,00:05:20.83,(gasps) What?
82,00:05:23.83,00:05:23.83,">> You know what? I saw something, but..."
83,00:05:25.25,00:05:25.25,">> They're, like, walking around."
84,00:05:27.04,00:05:27.04,They're not afraid of anything. See? They're right there.
85,00:05:28.54,00:05:28.54,>> Ooh! >> Ew!
86,00:05:31.25,00:05:31.25,>> Get out! >> They're right there.
87,00:05:33.29,00:05:33.29,">> I know it's mind over matter, and I know"
88,00:05:35.42,00:05:35.42,"if you don't mind, it doesn't matter,"
89,00:05:36.92,00:05:36.92,"but, ooh, I mind and it matters. I just can't stand those things."
90,00:05:41.08,00:05:41.08,They're huge. Ugh!
91,00:05:46.75,00:05:46.75,">> Tom, I love the, uh, the new campsite choice."
92,00:05:49.62,00:05:49.62,">> Really? >> Although, do you think"
93,00:05:52.38,00:05:52.38,there could be a worse island than this?
94,00:05:54.79,00:05:54.79,">> Oh, I'm sure there are. >> You think so?"
95,00:05:57.38,00:05:57.38,">> Oh, yeah. >> It wasn't safe for us"
96,00:06:00.67,00:06:00.67,to choose this island. It was just a quick decision
97,00:06:02.71,00:06:02.71,"we made, and I-I regret that we didn't think it through."
98,00:06:05.79,00:06:05.79,"Tom, having taken the leader role in the tribe,"
99,00:06:10.08,00:06:10.08,"said, ""Let's go for it. It's an adventure."""
100,00:06:13.25,00:06:13.25,It was a rash choice made in a moment that could really affect
101,00:06:17.92,00:06:17.92,the game for this tribe. The way the whole thing came
102,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,"down, I think Willard said, ""I think we should take a vote."""
103,00:06:24.46,00:06:24.46,"And you said, ""I think we should do it..."""
104,00:06:27.12,00:06:27.12,">> Oh... okay. >> ""We-We're on for another"
105,00:06:28.71,00:06:28.71,"adventure, it's part of... we're here for an adventure."""
106,00:06:30.88,00:06:30.88,Without having... >> I-I just... I'm gonna
107,00:06:32.83,00:06:32.83,disagree just because... I-I thought we should go
108,00:06:34.88,00:06:34.88,"back, too, and then... >> You did?"
109,00:06:36.79,00:06:36.79,">> ...three guys-- three people-- were all saying,"
110,00:06:38.50,00:06:38.50,"""No, let's go to a new place. We're out of coconuts."""
111,00:06:40.62,00:06:40.62,>> Can we agree that we should have a vote?
112,00:06:43.17,00:06:43.17,>> Definitely. >> Even if it... if it's just
113,00:06:44.88,00:06:44.88,"to make a decision. Okay, okay, guys."
114,00:06:46.33,00:06:46.33,Raise your hand. Who wants to go? Stay?
115,00:06:47.79,00:06:47.79,"Raise if you want to go. >> Caryn's really annoying,"
116,00:06:50.04,00:06:50.04,because she has not stopped talking about how this island
117,00:06:55.50,00:06:55.50,sucks and how everyone didn't want to come here.
118,00:06:57.25,00:06:57.25,"(thunder crashing) >> Oh, no!"
119,00:07:02.12,00:07:02.12,">> We only had a second to decide, and the majority was,"
120,00:07:04.38,00:07:04.38,"like, ""Let's go,"" you know? New tribe, new camp."
121,00:07:06.54,00:07:06.54,"Unfortunately, it was the wrong decision."
122,00:07:08.96,00:07:08.96,"Oh, well, we're here. Get over it."
123,00:07:11.12,00:07:11.12,(thunder crashing) >> We went to our first
124,00:07:34.12,00:07:34.12,"Tribal Council, and we got rid of Jo."
125,00:07:37.00,00:07:37.00,"I think it was a great decision, actually."
126,00:07:40.21,00:07:40.21,"I think our whole team thinks it, our whole tribe thinks it"
127,00:07:44.00,00:07:44.00,"was. >> It's time to get up, y'all."
128,00:07:47.79,00:07:47.79,">> Mmm... >> Without Jolanda around,"
129,00:07:51.12,00:07:51.12,"everybody's feeling good, you know, 'cause there's nobody"
130,00:07:53.04,00:07:53.04,telling people what to do. We're not going
131,00:07:55.92,00:07:55.92,to follow a leader. >> So what should we do?
132,00:08:02.04,00:08:02.04,>> Well... >> Wake up first.
133,00:08:05.12,00:08:05.12,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
134,00:08:07.04,00:08:07.04,>> We can make our own decisions and be democratic about it.
135,00:08:11.92,00:08:11.92,"We're Americans, and we're going to do democracy."
136,00:08:16.58,00:08:16.58,"Come on, y'all. Gather around."
137,00:08:19.58,00:08:19.58,>> See what we got. >> You ready?
138,00:08:21.12,00:08:21.12,">> Yeah. Get your ass up here, Ibrehem."
139,00:08:24.29,00:08:24.29,>> All right. >> I hear you.
140,00:08:26.50,00:08:26.50,>> Maybe not. (chuckles)
141,00:08:29.00,00:08:29.00,">> Go ahead, Bobby. >> ""Keep on your toes"
142,00:08:32.04,00:08:32.04,"while making this run. ""Your rivals will seek"
143,00:08:33.75,00:08:33.75,"to spoil your fun. ""You'll, too, have the chance"
144,00:08:36.58,00:08:36.58,"to spoil their mood. Stay out of the water,"
145,00:08:38.54,00:08:38.54,"and you may catch more food."" >> I think we might fight"
146,00:08:41.12,00:08:41.12,"people. >> Yeah, we're gonna... yeah."
147,00:08:43.96,00:08:43.96,>> I'm not quite sure of my game plan yet.
148,00:08:47.46,00:08:47.46,"I know that obviously there are people who did vote for me,"
149,00:08:52.46,00:08:52.46,"and so, uh, I just want to make myself"
150,00:08:55.08,00:08:55.08,"a valuable asset to this tribe. If I don't, I'll probably"
151,00:08:58.46,00:08:58.46,be on the chopping block again. >> PROBST: Come on in.
152,00:09:08.00,00:09:08.00,Take a spot on the mat. We'll now bring in Ulong.
153,00:09:14.25,00:09:14.25,Jolanda voted out at the first Tribal Council.
154,00:09:19.25,00:09:19.25,"Koror, how's the fire working out?"
155,00:09:21.71,00:09:21.71,>> It's not too good. We capsized yesterday.
156,00:09:26.08,00:09:26.08,>> We just kind of lost it. >> PROBST: You lost your fire?
157,00:09:30.54,00:09:30.54,That made Jeff really happy. >> As well it should.
158,00:09:35.25,00:09:35.25,">> We're going to find it. We're the Bad News Bears, man."
159,00:09:38.33,00:09:38.33,"Our back's against the wall, and we're coming on strong."
160,00:09:41.21,00:09:41.21,>> PROBST: You guys ready for today's challenge?
161,00:09:43.25,00:09:43.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: It is for reward.
162,00:09:45.17,00:09:45.17,Here's how it works. You will attempt to cross
163,00:09:47.67,00:09:47.67,a balance obstacle course. Moving one tribe member at a
164,00:09:51.08,00:09:51.08,"time, you'll begin by swinging over a trench."
165,00:09:54.12,00:09:54.12,"You'll then make your way over three rolling drums,"
166,00:09:56.75,00:09:56.75,across a balance beam and over a wobbly bridge.
167,00:09:59.42,00:09:59.42,"Finally, you're going to cross a rope bridge where' you'll"
168,00:10:01.79,00:10:01.79,retrieve a flag and make your way back to the start.
169,00:10:05.96,00:10:05.96,"Along the way, members of the other tribe are going to"
170,00:10:08.12,00:10:08.12,try to knock you off by swinging heavy bags of sand.
171,00:10:11.25,00:10:11.25,First tribe to collect ten flags wins reward.
172,00:10:13.33,00:10:13.33,If at any time you're knocked off the course or you fall off
173,00:10:16.33,00:10:16.33,"the course, go back to the start."
174,00:10:19.04,00:10:19.04,Each tribe will assign two members to be in charge
175,00:10:21.50,00:10:21.50,of swinging the heavy bags. Only rule: everyone has to cross
176,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,the rope swing at least once. Make sense?
177,00:10:26.50,00:10:26.50,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Want to know what
178,00:10:29.17,00:10:29.17,you're playing for? >> Yeah.
179,00:10:31.08,00:10:31.08,">> PROBST: If you can't get food with this, you don't deserve"
180,00:10:34.12,00:10:34.12,"to be out here. >> Oh, hell, yeah!"
181,00:10:37.17,00:10:37.17,"Come on, man. >> PROBST: Mask and snorkel,"
182,00:10:39.92,00:10:39.92,fins... >> Oh... Yes.
183,00:10:43.25,00:10:43.25,">> PROBST: ...spear. >> I love you, Jeff."
184,00:10:45.46,00:10:45.46,">> PROBST: In addition, Ulong, since you haven't won it yet,"
185,00:10:49.08,00:10:49.08,you're playing for flint. >> You the man.
186,00:10:52.12,00:10:52.12,">> PROBST: Koror, who are going to be the two people responsible"
187,00:10:55.00,00:10:55.00,for swinging the bags? >> Myself and Gregg.
188,00:10:57.08,00:10:57.08,>> PROBST: Tom and Gregg. Ulong?
189,00:10:58.62,00:10:58.62,"Jeff and Ibrehem. Okay, Koror, you have"

343,00:19:00.54,00:19:00.54,(laughing) >> There's got to

347,00:19:08.38,00:19:08.38,"You know, I didn't get a whole lot, but I got enough"
348,00:19:10.96,00:19:10.96,so that everybody could have a couple of pinches of protein.

353,00:19:32.25,00:19:32.25,"their flint, and I hope they don't find it."

355,00:19:47.21,00:19:47.21,"We dropped the box, and we gotta go find it today."
356,00:19:50.21,00:19:50.21,">> We went out at the absolute worst time,"
357,00:19:53.21,00:19:53.21,and the current was ripping like I've never seen
358,00:19:55.83,00:19:55.83,"the ocean tide rip. It was like, almost like being"
359,00:19:58.83,00:19:58.83,in a fast-moving river. We were paddling as fast
360,00:20:01.04,00:20:01.04,as we could and just barely holding position.
361,00:20:03.88,00:20:03.88,"Come on, Ian! >> Give him the anchor. Go!"
362,00:20:07.08,00:20:07.08,On your right. >> You've got to keep paddling.
363,00:20:09.54,00:20:09.54,>> I don't know if we were that far over.
364,00:20:12.75,00:20:12.75,>> I don't think it was that far over.
365,00:20:15.00,00:20:15.00,>> But I do think it was slightly that way.
366,00:20:16.92,00:20:16.92,They're going to be so disappointed when they come
367,00:20:20.58,00:20:20.58,"back, if they don't get it. >> Okay, I see it, I see it,"
368,00:20:24.25,00:20:24.25,I see it. (screams excitedly)
369,00:20:26.83,00:20:26.83,Don't lose the spot. Don't lose the spot.
370,00:20:29.08,00:20:29.08,We're drifting. It was definitely
371,00:20:30.50,00:20:30.50,the strongest current I've ever faced in my life.
372,00:20:32.67,00:20:32.67,And the box was about 25 feet down.
373,00:20:34.92,00:20:34.92,We tried everything; we tried hooking the anchor
374,00:20:37.04,00:20:37.04,"into the handle on the box and bring it up, that up,"
375,00:20:40.29,00:20:40.29,but it kept slipping. >> Got it?
376,00:20:42.17,00:20:42.17,(Ian grunts) >> I feel like I lost it.
377,00:20:44.17,00:20:44.17,">> Do you see it? >> As I got more and more tired,"
378,00:20:46.08,00:20:46.08,"it became more and more difficult to get to the bottom,"
379,00:20:48.33,00:20:48.33,became more and more difficult to tread water.
380,00:20:50.29,00:20:50.29,"So, there were a couple of times when I was like, ""Okay,"
381,00:20:53.17,00:20:53.17,"""you know, I'm underwater; I don't know if I'm going to be"
382,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,"able to make it."" I had it hooked again."
383,00:21:00.08,00:21:00.08,You see it? >> That it right there?
384,00:21:01.96,00:21:01.96,>> I saw it when I just scratched the box.
385,00:21:13.25,00:21:13.25,">> I got it! Hey, guys, just bring it over"
386,00:21:16.58,00:21:16.58,"quick, please. Hurry."
387,00:21:23.29,00:21:23.29,Yeah! (screams excitedly)
388,00:21:31.04,00:21:31.04,(yells and laughs) >> Ah-ha-ha!
389,00:21:32.83,00:21:32.83,>> Yeah! >> Yay!
390,00:21:34.21,00:21:34.21,(cheering) >> Yay!
391,00:21:36.58,00:21:36.58,(screaming jubilantly) >> Getting the box
392,00:21:38.58,00:21:38.58,"and having it was like, I mean, it was like"
393,00:21:40.83,00:21:40.83,running the marathon and winning first place.
394,00:21:42.62,00:21:42.62,"Once we got it into the boat, it was like, man, it was like"
395,00:21:45.21,00:21:45.21,holding on to a big piece of gold.
396,00:21:47.38,00:21:47.38,(laughing) (whooping)
397,00:21:50.62,00:21:50.62,">> Nice job, Gregg. (laughing)"
398,00:21:54.46,00:21:54.46,(laughing elatedly) >> It's one of the happiest
399,00:21:57.46,00:21:57.46,moments of my life. It was definitely a high
400,00:21:59.92,00:21:59.92,for all of us. And even though
401,00:22:01.42,00:22:01.42,"we lost the challenge, it really felt like"
402,00:22:03.58,00:22:03.58,"we won the day. >> Come on, fire."
403,00:22:06.71,00:22:06.71,">> Okay, okay, blow. Don't blow too hard."
404,00:22:08.75,00:22:08.75,">> Oh, my God. (indistinct voices)"
405,00:22:11.29,00:22:11.29,"(clapping) >> Good job, guys."
406,00:22:13.04,00:22:13.04,">> A group effort, right there. >> Isn't that beautiful?"
407,00:22:17.25,00:22:17.25,>> I'm so proud of you guys. >> A good day. A good day.
408,00:22:20.21,00:22:20.21,We can be proud. >> We got a lot of clam.
409,00:22:34.75,00:22:34.75,>> Look at all of them. >> You want just to cook it all?
410,00:22:37.17,00:22:37.17,">> Yeah. Yeah. >> You know, I hate clams, but"
411,00:22:39.50,00:22:39.50,I know this is going to be good. >> Yeah. I haven't had
412,00:22:41.75,00:22:41.75,"giant clam before. >> Well, first time for"
413,00:22:43.46,00:22:43.46,"everything, right? >> Tonight is gonna be"
414,00:22:46.04,00:22:46.04,"our first time we had fire, our first time we have water"
415,00:22:49.08,00:22:49.08,and our first time we're eating in four days
416,00:22:50.96,00:22:50.96,since we've been here. We're all famished
417,00:22:52.75,00:22:52.75,"and we're ready to chow down. >> Oh, my God, it's so good."
418,00:22:56.04,00:22:56.04,"How's the seaweed? >> Oh, my God."
419,00:22:58.67,00:22:58.67,You know what? We can't complain
420,00:23:00.21,00:23:00.21,"right now, for real. >> Oh, I know."
421,00:23:01.67,00:23:01.67,">> Hell, no. >> We haven't eaten in four"
422,00:23:03.50,00:23:03.50,"days. >> We, for the first night,"
423,00:23:06.17,00:23:06.17,had actual food besides coconuts.
424,00:23:08.96,00:23:08.96,Ashlee didn't want any of it. >> You don't like clam?
425,00:23:16.25,00:23:16.25,>> The way we're gonna advance ourselves
426,00:23:18.58,00:23:18.58,"is be a strong team all the way through,"
427,00:23:20.79,00:23:20.79,"and if we have someone slowing us down,"
428,00:23:22.67,00:23:22.67,I hope that that doesn't bring down our team.
429,00:23:28.17,00:23:28.17,">> Ashlee went into the shelter, and she went to sleep."
430,00:23:30.79,00:23:30.79,"This fire was a big, big thing, and she should have"
431,00:23:33.79,00:23:33.79,came outside and just kind of sat there.
432,00:23:36.21,00:23:36.21,"Sometimes we do things we don't want to do,"
433,00:23:38.12,00:23:38.12,"but it's just things you need to do, 'cause we are a tribe"
434,00:23:41.04,00:23:41.04,"here and, you know, people will get voted off this tribe"
435,00:23:43.54,00:23:43.54,in this game we're playing. >> I'm passing out.
436,00:23:50.12,00:23:50.12,>> I'm fighting to stay awake right now.
437,00:23:52.08,00:23:52.08,">> Yeah, I-I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna crash."
438,00:24:01.79,00:24:01.79,">> Kim's been snuggling on Jeff a lot, and I'm not"
439,00:24:06.54,00:24:06.54,quite sure how that... if she's playing him or not.
440,00:24:08.96,00:24:08.96,"I mean, two-people alliance is a very strong alliance,"
441,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,and so I'm not sure if they're kind of
442,00:24:13.25,00:24:13.25,buddying up to make an alliance. And so I'm kind of waiting to
443,00:24:17.04,00:24:17.04,"see how that all will play out. >> Oh, look."
444,00:24:32.71,00:24:32.71,>> What do you think it is? >> Dishes. Military dishes.
445,00:24:37.08,00:24:37.08,It's a code. Lear... Learn.
446,00:24:42.04,00:24:42.04,">> T... >> ""Learn this."""
447,00:24:43.17,00:24:43.17,"It's ""Learn this."" We need to learn this code."
448,00:24:46.25,00:24:46.25,"Hey, guys! >> Guys, we got tree mail."
449,00:24:48.62,00:24:48.62,>> It's Morse Code. >> The tree mail just came
450,00:24:51.96,00:24:51.96,and we're about to all learn Morse Code.
451,00:24:53.62,00:24:53.62,"Right now, we've all broken it off into sections,"
452,00:24:56.21,00:24:56.21,'cause there's eight people. We don't know if that's
453,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,"a good strategy or not, but we think it's"
454,00:24:59.96,00:24:59.96,the best one we got. Does anybody want to quiz me?
455,00:25:02.29,00:25:02.29,">> All right, W? >> Dot-dash-dash."
456,00:25:05.71,00:25:05.71,>>  Winning the other day definitely gave us
457,00:25:07.83,00:25:07.83,"a confidence boost, but we're going to have"
458,00:25:10.62,00:25:10.62,"an immunity challenge here, and we got to win that, too."
459,00:25:30.71,00:25:30.71,">> PROBST: All right, first things first."
460,00:25:33.21,00:25:33.21,"Give it up, Caryn. Immunity back up for grabs."
461,00:25:39.38,00:25:39.38,Ready to get to today's challenge?
462,00:25:42.29,00:25:42.29,>> Yep. >> Yes.
463,00:25:44.54,00:25:44.54,>> PROBST: You received tree mail this morning.
464,00:25:46.21,00:25:46.21,It said learn Morse Code. I hope you did.
465,00:25:48.04,00:25:48.04,"On my ""go,"" you'll swim out to a floating platform."
466,00:25:50.88,00:25:50.88,"You'll dive down ten feet, where you'll find a rope"
467,00:25:53.04,00:25:53.04,that's strung through a barrel and attached to a footlocker
468,00:25:56.46,00:25:56.46,"that is 50 feet away. While underwater,"
469,00:25:59.12,00:25:59.12,"you're gonna pull on a rope, and as you do you'll bring that"
470,00:26:02.71,00:26:02.71,"footlocker closer and closer. Every ten feet, a marker buoy"
471,00:26:04.83,00:26:04.83,will pop up showing you how far you have to go.
472,00:26:08.25,00:26:08.25,"Once you've released all five buoys, that footlocker will be"
473,00:26:11.04,00:26:11.04,right in front of you. You can open it.
474,00:26:13.25,00:26:13.25,Eight mess kits will pop up. Bring them back with you to
475,00:26:17.46,00:26:17.46,"shore, you'll then use the Morse Code painted on the mess kits"
476,00:26:21.04,00:26:21.04,to decode a hidden word. First tribe to solve
477,00:26:24.17,00:26:24.17,the puzzle wins immunity. Safe from the vote.
478,00:26:26.79,00:26:26.79,"For the losers, a trip to Tribal Council, you will vote"
479,00:26:30.50,00:26:30.50,one member out of your tribe. Make sense?
480,00:26:33.04,00:26:33.04,"Koror, you have one extra member-- got to sit somebody"
481,00:26:36.42,00:26:36.42,out; you cannot sit out the same person.
482,00:26:38.25,00:26:38.25,Willard sat out in the last challenge.
483,00:26:40.12,00:26:40.12,Katie. All right. Everybody else take your spots.
484,00:26:42.21,00:26:42.21,"Wait for my ""go."" Here we go. For immunity."
485,00:26:50.04,00:26:50.04,Survivors ready. Go!
486,00:26:53.04,00:26:53.04,All eight have to get to the pontoon before you can dive
487,00:26:56.50,00:26:56.50,down. Got to have everybody
488,00:26:59.92,00:26:59.92,at the pontoon before you can start pulling on the rope.
489,00:27:03.17,00:27:03.17,Willard falling behind. (indistinct talking)
490,00:27:08.08,00:27:08.08,"Ulong, go down. >> Go. Go."
491,00:27:18.25,00:27:18.25,>> PROBST: Koror has to wait. They cannot begin until
492,00:27:20.79,00:27:20.79,Willard gets to the pontoon. Ulong getting a big head start.
493,00:27:27.79,00:27:27.79,Steph heading down. >> Let's go.
494,00:27:33.21,00:27:33.21,"Come on, Willard. Let's get him, pull him up."
495,00:27:35.12,00:27:35.12,">> PROBST: Go, Koror. Coby, Tom going down together."

497,00:27:51.67,00:27:51.67,They're only 40 feet away now. Tom made up a lot of ground
498,00:28:05.92,00:28:05.92,on that. Angie's heading down.
499,00:28:21.12,00:28:21.12,"Ian and Tom, going down together."
500,00:28:24.62,00:28:24.62,Koror has a buddy system. >> PROBST: Koror with the lead.
501,00:28:37.17,00:28:37.17,>> Got 'em on the run. Let's go.

506,00:29:07.38,00:29:07.38,Jeff taking a good long rest; he heads back down.
507,00:29:15.75,00:29:15.75,Jeff not down very long. Ibrehem also right back up.
508,00:29:26.33,00:29:26.33,"Koror, getting that footlocker closer and closer."
509,00:29:29.54,00:29:29.54,"Only ten feet to go. >> Guys, we're way ahead."
510,00:29:32.08,00:29:32.08,>> PROBST: Ulong falling behind. >> We gotta keep going.
511,00:29:35.12,00:29:35.12,"We gotta keep going. >> PROBST: Kim, the only one who"
512,00:29:37.29,00:29:37.29,has not been down for Ulong. Steph heading back down.
513,00:29:48.88,00:29:48.88,Ulong with a lot of ground to still make up.
514,00:29:51.29,00:29:51.29,Ian heading down for Koror. Koror's got their trunk.
515,00:30:03.25,00:30:03.25,Got to open your trunk and release the mess kits.
516,00:30:08.21,00:30:08.21,Ian releases the locker. It's open.
517,00:30:12.17,00:30:12.17,Koror has to unclip eight mess kits.

540,00:31:55.04,00:31:55.04,"Sorry to say, another visit to Tribal Council."
541,00:31:57.46,00:31:57.46,Another tribe member going home. Up to you to figure out
542,00:32:00.12,00:32:00.12,who that's gonna be. Head on back to camp.

544,00:32:21.42,00:32:21.42,"disappointed, and to make matters worse, it was raining,"
545,00:32:27.67,00:32:27.67,"so our main priority was, oh, crap, I hope our fire"
546,00:32:30.58,00:32:30.58,didn't burn out. >> Get this.
547,00:32:34.33,00:32:34.33,">> Luckily, we were able to scoop up any hot coals that we"
548,00:32:39.17,00:32:39.17,could and rushed to a cave. >> Let's go to that cave
549,00:32:43.75,00:32:43.75,down yonder. >> What cave?
550,00:32:45.62,00:32:45.62,Cave down here we have to go to. >> They're behind us...

555,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,want to go help? Both of us can't stay.
556,00:33:07.33,00:33:07.33,">> Oh, dude, no. >> Ange, are you staying?"
557,00:33:09.67,00:33:09.67,>> I'll stay. I'll stay if you want
558,00:33:11.58,00:33:11.58,to go back to camp. We can... whatever you want.
559,00:33:22.00,00:33:22.00,>> I talked to Ashlee a little bit.

562,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,'cause you guys really pulled through for me last time.

564,00:33:33.67,00:33:33.67,"as much as everybody else. >> At the immunity challenge,"
565,00:33:39.08,00:33:39.08,Kim didn't want to help the team pull that chest.
566,00:33:44.38,00:33:44.38,So I'll tell you how it's going to happen.
567,00:33:46.25,00:33:46.25,"Kim is gone. >> Oh, yeah, for sure."
568,00:33:49.71,00:33:49.71,">> And it's obvious to me you're attracted to Kim, okay?"
569,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,"And right now, psychologically, sociologically, I'm seeing Kim"
570,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"as a threat, you know? >> Yeah. I just... I mean,"
571,00:34:04.04,00:34:04.04,"I was thinking Ashlee, to be honest."
572,00:34:06.08,00:34:06.08,"She's-She's breaking down, man. I can see it."
573,00:34:09.08,00:34:09.08,"I mean, I can tell she's breaking down."
574,00:34:11.88,00:34:11.88,">> She's not a threat, though, at the moment."
575,00:34:14.46,00:34:14.46,>> James is definitely rubbing me the wrong way.
576,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,"He doesn't have the right to come to me and say, ""Oh,"
577,00:34:19.75,00:34:19.75,"listen, it's Kim over Ashlee."" Well, not to me it's not."
578,00:34:22.96,00:34:22.96,Ashlee has kind of changed her frame of mind.
579,00:34:27.62,00:34:27.62,"I can see her slowing down. I mean at this point, let's vote"
580,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"off our weakest link. >> Hey, Steph."
581,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,">> What? >> After kinda like thinking,"
582,00:34:40.21,00:34:40.21,I think we push Ashlee. >> Yeah?
583,00:34:44.42,00:34:44.42,">> I mean, just being honest with you."
584,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,">> Honestly, Kim and Ashlee are just..."
585,00:34:47.38,00:34:47.38,"they're about right here. You know, one's up, one's down."
586,00:34:50.04,00:34:50.04,"One's up, one's down. So you gotta go with your gut"
587,00:34:52.12,00:34:52.12,instinct. >> But I'm telling you that we 
588,00:34:54.12,00:34:54.12,need to break her and Jeff up because...
589,00:34:57.08,00:34:57.08,">> I don't see what's wrong with that, really, right now."
590,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,">> You don't? But if they stay together,"
591,00:35:02.75,00:35:02.75,they're going to go. They're going to go to the end.
592,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,">> Mm, not necessarily. >> I mean, she didn't even"
593,00:35:08.75,00:35:08.75,try at the challenge. She stood up there.
594,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,>> Yeah. >> She wouldn't go down in the
595,00:35:12.79,00:35:12.79,water. The bottom line is we have to
596,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,think of who's going to be better for the team right now
597,00:35:17.08,00:35:17.08,so we don't have to go back to Tribal Council.
598,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,"Angie, myself, James and Ashlee still want to vote Kim"
599,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,off. Bobby Jon is undecided.
600,00:35:25.33,00:35:25.33,"So it's a complete mess, because actually, now"
601,00:35:27.42,00:35:27.42,it looks like four people are voting against Kim
602,00:35:29.75,00:35:29.75,"and four people are voting against Ashlee,"
603,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,so we're going to have a tie. I don't even know
604,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,what happens in a tie. >> What are you doing?
605,00:35:36.00,00:35:36.00,">> Dude, I don't even know. >> I don't know now."
606,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00,>> Is it me? >> Between you and Ashlee.
607,00:35:43.58,00:35:43.58,">> Really? Who said me? >> It's, like, the consensus."
608,00:35:47.96,00:35:47.96,Everybody. >> I want to know.
609,00:35:50.08,00:35:50.08,"If I'm going to get voted off, I want somebody to tell me"
610,00:35:52.79,00:35:52.79,"that they're voting for me, and I will respect the people"
611,00:35:55.33,00:35:55.33,"a heck of a lot more if they can just be, like,"
612,00:35:57.12,00:35:57.12,"""Yes, I'm voting for you."" I don't want to frickin' go"
613,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,home. I don't think I should have to
614,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,"go home. But, J, look at me."
615,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,I want you to swear to God that you'll tell me if you're
616,00:36:06.12,00:36:06.12,going to vote for me. >> I'll tell you.
617,00:36:09.00,00:36:09.00,">> Okay. >> I promise, okay?"
618,00:36:13.25,00:36:13.25,">> Bobby Jon wasn't sure. He thinks it's gonna be you,"
619,00:36:17.08,00:36:17.08,"but... I'm totally not thinking,"
620,00:36:21.04,00:36:21.04,"like, smart at all. >> Well, maybe they're trying to"
621,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,"do the same thing we're doing. Those four in an alliance,"
622,00:36:27.25,00:36:27.25,"and then if one of us goes, we're going to be picked off"
623,00:36:29.04,00:36:29.04,one by one. >> I really think it's going
624,00:36:32.08,00:36:32.08,to end up in a tie if everybody sticks to where they're at right
625,00:36:34.12,00:36:34.12,"now. Obviously, you can't assume"
626,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,anything in this game. So they might do something
627,00:36:39.71,00:36:39.71,"totally different, and I don't know."
628,00:37:11.25,00:37:11.25,>> PROBST: Very subdued faces. Tribal Council wasn't fun the
629,00:37:14.42,00:37:14.42,first time. Not going to be any
630,00:37:17.08,00:37:17.08,"more enjoyable tonight. Well, first, let's start with"
631,00:37:19.71,00:37:19.71,"some of the good things. Angie, from where I sit,"
632,00:37:23.58,00:37:23.58,"an amazing turnaround, considering you were last"
633,00:37:26.75,00:37:26.75,"picked, thought you were nearly out of this tribe, and then we"
634,00:37:29.54,00:37:29.54,we get to this reward challenge and you dominated.
635,00:37:32.58,00:37:32.58,Was there an impact with the tribe?
636,00:37:34.58,00:37:34.58,Did they recognize that? >> I think that they did
637,00:37:37.46,00:37:37.46,recognize. I think that when somebody was
638,00:37:39.96,00:37:39.96,"saying that I was a physical weak link, I think that kind of"
639,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,"got into the heads of other people, even though it wasn't"
640,00:37:45.88,00:37:45.88,"necessarily true. >> PROBST: Well, here's the good"
641,00:37:47.79,00:37:47.79,news. You did win the reward
642,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,challenge. And with that came fishing gear
643,00:37:52.46,00:37:52.46,and fire. The bad news of what's happened
644,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,"over the last couple of days, you lost another immunity"
645,00:37:57.92,00:37:57.92,"challenge. Kim, what was the reaction"
646,00:37:59.67,00:37:59.67,"when you got back to camp, knowing you were going to come"
647,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,back to Tribal Council and vote somebody out?
648,00:38:04.17,00:38:04.17,>> I think it was actually total devastation.
649,00:38:06.54,00:38:06.54,"I mean, we've become really, really close."
650,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,I don't think you're prepared for how quickly
651,00:38:11.08,00:38:11.08,"you bond with people. I mean, I... at home you never"
652,00:38:14.21,00:38:14.21,"feel this way after, what, six days with somebody?"
653,00:38:17.42,00:38:17.42,But we rely on each other so much.
654,00:38:21.46,00:38:21.46,>> PROBST: Jeff. Any friendships?
655,00:38:24.42,00:38:24.42,Flirting? Adversaries? Give me something.
656,00:38:28.58,00:38:28.58,">> Honestly, Kim and I have gotten to know each other"
657,00:38:31.67,00:38:31.67,a little bit more than I think I've gotten to know
658,00:38:34.04,00:38:34.04,"some of the other girls. >> PROBST: Kim, when did you"
659,00:38:36.92,00:38:36.92,feel the first initial seeds of any attraction?
660,00:38:39.83,00:38:39.83,>> It's hot in here all of a sudden.
661,00:38:41.42,00:38:41.42,(laughter) >> PROBST: Day one?
662,00:38:43.46,00:38:43.46,">> Actually, yes, it was day one."
663,00:38:45.29,00:38:45.29,"Because I couldn't sleep and he was staying up, so..."
664,00:38:49.00,00:38:49.00,>> PROBST: Steph. Have you noticed Jeff and Kim?
665,00:38:52.17,00:38:52.17,">> Yeah, they hang out a lot. They cuddle."
666,00:38:55.21,00:38:55.21,">> We've all noticed. >> All jokes aside, it really is"
667,00:38:58.04,00:38:58.04,nice to have someone laying next to you when you're cold.
668,00:39:00.46,00:39:00.46,It's a big difference. >> PROBST: The problem with
669,00:39:03.42,00:39:03.42,"that, Jeff, is you get into a game that is based on"
670,00:39:06.08,00:39:06.08,social relationships and it's about voting and numbers.
671,00:39:08.88,00:39:08.88,">> I see that completely, but I think everybody here"
672,00:39:11.62,00:39:11.62,understands that there's no alliances being built here.
673,00:39:18.00,00:39:18.00,">> PROBST: Kim, obviously, you must feel the same way."
674,00:39:20.29,00:39:20.29,">> Under my observations, I hope that they understand"
675,00:39:23.12,00:39:23.12,"that it's not... I mean, it's never crossed my mind that"
676,00:39:25.17,00:39:25.17,that's going to change anything or influence anything.
677,00:39:27.29,00:39:27.29,>> PROBST: It's never crossed your mind that they might look
678,00:39:30.21,00:39:30.21,"and say... ""Well...""? >> Not until now."
679,00:39:33.00,00:39:33.00,"Really, in all honesty. >> PROBST: James."
680,00:39:35.21,00:39:35.21,What are you basing your vote on tonight?
681,00:39:37.04,00:39:37.04,>> I got my mind made up. It's somebody that I think can't
682,00:39:40.38,00:39:40.38,"hang with the rest of us, they're lagging and they're..."
683,00:39:44.92,00:39:44.92,"ready to go home. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
684,00:39:48.46,00:39:48.46,"vote. Steph, you're up."
685,00:40:06.58,00:40:06.58,">> Ashlee was the one that picked me to be on this tribe,"
686,00:40:09.75,00:40:09.75,so I just feel like I have to be somewhat loyal to her right now.
687,00:40:25.42,00:40:25.42,">> I'm a man of my word, and plus, you just bug"
688,00:40:29.33,00:40:29.33,the hell out of me. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
689,00:40:47.08,00:40:47.08,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
690,00:41:02.79,00:41:02.79,decision is final. The person voted out will be
691,00:41:04.92,00:41:04.92,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
692,00:41:07.25,00:41:07.25,I'll read the votes. First vote...
693,00:41:12.62,00:41:12.62,...Kim. Ashlee.
694,00:41:18.17,00:41:18.17,One vote Kim; one vote Ashlee. Jeff.
695,00:41:22.58,00:41:22.58,One vote Kim; one vote Ashlee; one vote Jeff.
696,00:41:28.50,00:41:28.50,Ashlee. It's two votes Ashlee. Ashlee.
697,00:41:34.92,00:41:34.92,That's three votes Ashlee; one vote Kim; one vote Jeff.
698,00:41:41.17,00:41:41.17,Second person voted out of Survivor: Palau:
699,00:41:44.17,00:41:44.17,"Ashlee. Based on the votes cast,"
700,00:41:46.38,00:41:46.38,four is enough. You need to bring me your torch.
701,00:41:56.58,00:41:56.58,"Ashlee, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
702,00:42:11.42,00:42:11.42,"Well, I sense that tonight's vote was tough."
703,00:42:13.96,00:42:13.96,I do believe you guys are a tight tribe with a lot of good
704,00:42:17.12,00:42:17.12,"energy, but my take? Get a clear goal first,"
705,00:42:20.38,00:42:20.38,then harness that energy. Grab your torches.
706,00:42:23.12,00:42:23.12,Head back to camp. Good night.
707,00:42:38.38,00:42:38.38,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
708,00:42:45.04,00:42:45.04,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
709,00:42:48.17,00:42:48.17,>> They're coming closer. >> PROBST: Koror goes hunting.
710,00:42:50.25,00:42:50.25,>> There he is. >> PROBST: Ulong faces a
711,00:42:55.08,00:42:55.08,setback. >> I can barely put any weight
712,00:42:57.25,00:42:57.25,"on it right now. >> Everything I say,"
713,00:42:59.21,00:42:59.21,you have some snotty remark... >> PROBST: And Caryn and Katie
714,00:43:02.04,00:43:02.04,have it out. >> Get off me!
715,00:43:03.67,00:43:03.67,>> She's completely lost it. >> I'm just so incredibly
716,00:43:12.17,00:43:12.17,grateful to have had this opportunity.
717,00:43:15.88,00:43:15.88,I'm not surprised by the votes tonight.
718,00:43:18.12,00:43:18.12,I think that they all sensed I was ready to go home.
719,00:43:21.88,00:43:21.88,The only regret I have is that I did not use
720,00:43:24.46,00:43:24.46,the excuse that I was cold to cuddle with Ibrehem
721,00:43:27.42,00:43:27.42,'cause he sure is a cutie.
