54,00:02:37.92,00:02:37.92,we got picked for tribes?The only reason we lost the
55,00:02:40.21,00:02:40.21,challenge is 'cause we didn'tleave soon enough.

57,00:02:44.83,00:02:44.83,"at the challenge.>> We made a dumb mistake,"

67,00:04:39.04,00:04:39.04,"And of course, then there wasa turn of events with the"
68,00:04:40.54,00:04:40.54,"capsizing of the boat, and...the flint is at the"
69,00:04:43.83,00:04:43.83,"bottom of the ocean,so we can't even get fire."

97,00:06:05.79,00:06:05.79,"Tom, having taken the leaderrole in the tribe,"
98,00:06:10.08,00:06:10.08,"said, ""Let's go for it.It's an adventure."""
99,00:06:13.25,00:06:13.25,It was a rash choice made in amoment that could really affect
100,00:06:17.92,00:06:17.92,the game for this tribe.The way the whole thing came
101,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,"down, I think Willard said, ""Ithink we should take a vote."""
102,00:06:24.46,00:06:24.46,"And you said, ""I thinkwe should do it..."""
103,00:06:27.12,00:06:27.12,">> Oh... okay.>> ""We-We're on for another"
104,00:06:28.71,00:06:28.71,"adventure, it's part of...we're here for an adventure."""

114,00:06:47.79,00:06:47.79,"Raise if you want to go.>> Caryn's really annoying,"
115,00:06:50.04,00:06:50.04,because she has not stoppedtalking about how this island
116,00:06:55.50,00:06:55.50,sucks and how everyone didn'twant to come here.
117,00:06:57.25,00:06:57.25,"(thunder crashing)>> Oh, no!"

148,00:08:52.46,00:08:52.46,"and so, uh, I just wantto make myself"
149,00:08:55.08,00:08:55.08,"a valuable asset to this tribe.If I don't, I'll probably"
150,00:08:58.46,00:08:58.46,be on the chopping block again.>> PROBST: Come on in.
151,00:09:08.00,00:09:08.00,Take a spot on the mat.We'll now bring in Ulong.

161,00:09:45.17,00:09:45.17,Here's how it works.You will attempt to cross
162,00:09:47.67,00:09:47.67,a balance obstacle course.Moving one tribe member at a
163,00:09:51.08,00:09:51.08,"time, you'll begin by swingingover a trench."
164,00:09:54.12,00:09:54.12,"You'll then make your wayover three rolling drums,"
165,00:09:56.75,00:09:56.75,across a balance beamand over a wobbly bridge.
166,00:09:59.42,00:09:59.42,"Finally, you're going to crossa rope bridge where' you'll"
167,00:10:01.79,00:10:01.79,retrieve a flag and make yourway back to the start.
168,00:10:05.96,00:10:05.96,"Along the way, membersof the other tribe are going to"
169,00:10:08.12,00:10:08.12,try to knock you off byswinging heavy bags of sand.
170,00:10:11.25,00:10:11.25,First tribe to collectten flags wins reward.
171,00:10:13.33,00:10:13.33,If at any time you're knockedoff the course or you fall off

174,00:10:21.50,00:10:21.50,of swinging the heavy bags.Only rule: everyone has to cross
175,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,the rope swing at least once.Make sense?

565,00:33:44.38,00:33:44.38,So I'll tell you how it's goingto happen.
566,00:33:46.25,00:33:46.25,"Kim is gone.>> Oh, yeah, for sure."
567,00:33:49.71,00:33:49.71,">> And it's obvious to meyou're attracted to Kim, okay?"
568,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,"And right now, psychologically,sociologically, I'm seeing Kim"
569,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"as a threat, you know?>> Yeah. I just... I mean,"
570,00:34:04.04,00:34:04.04,"I was thinking Ashlee,to be honest."
571,00:34:06.08,00:34:06.08,"She's-She's breaking down, man.I can see it."
572,00:34:09.08,00:34:09.08,"I mean, I can tellshe's breaking down."
573,00:34:11.88,00:34:11.88,">> She's not a threat,though, at the moment."
574,00:34:14.46,00:34:14.46,>> James is definitely rubbingme the wrong way.
575,00:34:17.00,00:34:17.00,"He doesn't have the rightto come to me and say, ""Oh,"
576,00:34:19.75,00:34:19.75,"listen, it's Kim over Ashlee.""Well, not to me it's not."
577,00:34:22.96,00:34:22.96,Ashlee has kind of changedher frame of mind.
578,00:34:27.62,00:34:27.62,"I can see her slowing down.I mean at this point, let's vote"
579,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"off our weakest link.>> Hey, Steph."
580,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,">> What?>> After kinda like thinking,"
581,00:34:40.21,00:34:40.21,I think we push Ashlee.>> Yeah?
582,00:34:44.42,00:34:44.42,">> I mean, just being honestwith you."
583,00:34:46.00,00:34:46.00,">> Honestly, Kim and Ashleeare just..."
584,00:34:47.38,00:34:47.38,"they're about right here.You know, one's up, one's down."
585,00:34:50.04,00:34:50.04,"One's up, one's down.So you gotta go with your gut"
586,00:34:52.12,00:34:52.12,instinct.>> But I'm telling you that we 
587,00:34:54.12,00:34:54.12,need to break her and Jeff upbecause...
588,00:34:57.08,00:34:57.08,">> I don't see what's wrongwith that, really, right now."
589,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,">> You don't?But if they stay together,"
590,00:35:02.75,00:35:02.75,they're going to go.They're going to go to the end.
591,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,">> Mm, not necessarily.>> I mean, she didn't even"
592,00:35:08.75,00:35:08.75,try at the challenge.She stood up there.
593,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,>> Yeah.>> She wouldn't go down in the
594,00:35:12.79,00:35:12.79,water.The bottom line is we have to
595,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,think of who's going to bebetter for the team right now
596,00:35:17.08,00:35:17.08,so we don't have to go backto Tribal Council.
597,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,"Angie, myself, James andAshlee still want to vote Kim"
598,00:35:23.38,00:35:23.38,off.Bobby Jon is undecided.
599,00:35:25.33,00:35:25.33,"So it's a complete mess,because actually, now"
600,00:35:27.42,00:35:27.42,it looks like four peopleare voting against Kim
601,00:35:29.75,00:35:29.75,"and four people are votingagainst Ashlee,"
602,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,so we're going to have a tie.I don't even know
603,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,what happens in a tie.>> What are you doing?
604,00:35:36.00,00:35:36.00,">> Dude, I don't even know.>> I don't know now."
605,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00,>> Is it me?>> Between you and Ashlee.
606,00:35:43.58,00:35:43.58,">> Really? Who said me?>> It's, like, the consensus."
607,00:35:47.96,00:35:47.96,Everybody.>> I want to know.
608,00:35:50.08,00:35:50.08,"If I'm going to get voted off,I want somebody to tell me"
609,00:35:52.79,00:35:52.79,"that they're voting for me,and I will respect the people"
610,00:35:55.33,00:35:55.33,"a heck of a lot moreif they can just be, like,"

612,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,home.I don't think I should have to
613,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,"go home.But, J, look at me."
614,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,I want you to swear to Godthat you'll tell me if you're
615,00:36:06.12,00:36:06.12,going to vote for me.>> I'll tell you.
616,00:36:09.00,00:36:09.00,">> Okay.>> I promise, okay?"
617,00:36:13.25,00:36:13.25,">> Bobby Jon wasn't sure.He thinks it's gonna be you,"
618,00:36:17.08,00:36:17.08,"but...I'm totally not thinking,"
619,00:36:21.04,00:36:21.04,"like, smart at all.>> Well, maybe they're trying to"
620,00:36:24.42,00:36:24.42,"do the same thing we're doing.Those four in an alliance,"
621,00:36:27.25,00:36:27.25,"and then if one of us goes,we're going to be picked off"
622,00:36:29.04,00:36:29.04,one by one.>> I really think it's going
623,00:36:32.08,00:36:32.08,to end up in a tie if everybodysticks to where they're at right
624,00:36:34.12,00:36:34.12,"now.Obviously, you can't assume"
625,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,anything in this game.So they might do something
626,00:36:39.71,00:36:39.71,"totally different, and I don'tknow."

635,00:37:34.58,00:37:34.58,Did they recognize that?>> I think that they did
636,00:37:37.46,00:37:37.46,recognize.I think that when somebody was
637,00:37:39.96,00:37:39.96,"saying that I was a physicalweak link, I think that kind of"
638,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,"got into the heads of otherpeople, even though it wasn't"
639,00:37:45.88,00:37:45.88,"necessarily true.>> PROBST: Well, here's the good"
