605,00:27:48.63,00:27:48.63,>> ALL IN MY HANDS.
606,00:27:50.50,00:27:50.50,>> Jeff: IS IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE WITH YOUR
607,00:27:53.63,00:27:53.63,HANDS.
608,00:27:54.03,00:27:54.03,>> Jeff: A LOT OF THE CUTS.
609,00:27:55.47,00:27:55.47,A LOT OF THE BUG BITES.
610,00:27:59.40,00:27:59.40,"JUST MY OWN FAT ASS, JEFF."
611,00:28:02.63,00:28:02.63,">> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO START THE FEEL THAT PULL, AND JUST AS"
612,00:28:06.23,00:28:06.23,"I SAID IT, WILL FELT THE PULL."
613,00:28:08.23,00:28:08.23,WILL IS THE FIRST PERSON OUT OF THE CHALLENGE.
614,00:28:14.10,00:28:14.10,>> NOPE.

618,00:28:24.27,00:28:24.27,"HOW YOU DOING, CAROLYN."
619,00:28:25.40,00:28:25.40,>> GOOD.
620,00:28:26.20,00:28:26.20,"LOVING LIFE, JEFF."
621,00:28:28.10,00:28:28.10,BEST ADVENTURE EVER.
622,00:28:29.80,00:28:29.80,>> Jeff: THE TEMPTATION IS TO TRY TO INCH YOUR WAY BACK UP
623,00:28:33.23,00:28:33.23,THAT ROPE.
624,00:28:34.93,00:28:34.93,MAKES IT VERY FRUSTRATING.
625,00:28:37.00,00:28:37.00,THIS CHALLENGE CAN CATCH UP TO YOU WITHOUT MUCH WARNING.
626,00:28:44.20,00:28:44.20,JUST LIKE THAT SIERRA DROPS.
627,00:28:48.73,00:28:48.73,RODNEY DROPS.

637,00:29:25.90,00:29:25.90,ALL RIGHT.
638,00:29:26.50,00:29:26.50,I WANT YOU TO START THINKING MOVING FURTHER DOWN ON THE ROPE
639,00:29:29.00,00:29:29.00,NOW.
640,00:29:29.17,00:29:29.17,IT WILL REALLY GET TOUGH.
641,00:29:31.93,00:29:31.93,ALL RIGHT.

648,00:29:51.37,00:29:51.37,CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSITION.

650,00:30:03.07,00:30:03.07,TYLER DROPS OUT.

661,00:30:27.87,00:30:27.87,WILL JOIN THE JURY.
662,00:30:28.83,00:30:28.83,"GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL."
663,00:30:33.20,00:30:33.20,CONGRATS.
664,00:30:33.47,00:30:33.47,>> THANKS.
665,00:30:35.07,00:30:35.07,>> THE GOOD NEWS IS MIKE HAS TO PLAY THAT IDOL.
666,00:30:38.57,00:30:38.57,"2 BAD NEWS, I GOT TWO VOTES LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND RIGHT NOW"
667,00:30:43.43,00:30:43.43,"THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MY ADVANTAGE, WHICH MAKES ME AN"
668,00:30:48.93,00:30:48.93,EASY TARGET.
669,00:31:16.07,00:31:16.07,I WON MY SECOND IMMUNITY CHALLENGE IN A ROW.
670,00:31:20.97,00:31:20.97,WOO WOO.
671,00:31:21.20,00:31:21.20,SO EXCITED.
672,00:31:22.90,00:31:22.90,BUT IT'S NOT CUT AND DRY HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME NOW BECAUSE
673,00:31:26.63,00:31:26.63,THERE'S SO MANY OPTIONS.
674,00:31:27.87,00:31:27.87,SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT MOVE.
675,00:31:36.20,00:31:36.20,">> GUYS, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?"
676,00:31:41.43,00:31:41.43,>> DOES IT PUT FEAR INTO ME THAT MY NAME COULD GET WRITTEN DOWN?
677,00:31:45.63,00:31:45.63,OF COURSE IT DOES.
678,00:31:46.47,00:31:46.47,"I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THREE PEOPLE ARE GOING HOME TONIGHT, ME, MIKE"
679,00:31:51.30,00:31:51.30,OR TYLER.
680,00:31:52.53,00:31:52.53,"BUT MIKE'S PROBABLY GOING THE PLAY HIS IDOL TONIGHT, SO THE"
681,00:31:56.27,00:31:56.27,ODDS ARE ON EITHER TYLER OR MYSELF BECAUSE THEY SEE TYLER AS
682,00:32:00.77,00:32:00.77,"A THREAT, AND MY NAME KEEPS GETTING WRITTEN DOWN."
683,00:32:06.80,00:32:06.80,">> GUYS VOTE MIKE, GIRLS VOTE TYLER."
684,00:32:16.23,00:32:16.23,MIKE VOTES GETS THREE VOTES.
685,00:32:20.30,00:32:20.30,MIKE IS GOING TO VOTE FOR TYLER.
686,00:32:21.90,00:32:21.90,"AS FAR AS DAN'S CONCERNED, WE'RE GUNNING FOR TYLER, BUT VOTING"
687,00:32:25.67,00:32:25.67,FOR DAN IS NOT REALLY A BAD IDEA BECAUSE WE GET RID OF THE
688,00:32:29.23,00:32:29.23,ADVANTAGE.
689,00:32:35.83,00:32:35.83,>> WILL ALSO VOTED FOR ME.

692,00:32:41.23,00:32:41.23,>> I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT WITH
693,00:32:43.97,00:32:43.97,WILL.
694,00:32:44.73,00:32:44.73,">> YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING, THOUGH?"
695,00:32:55.07,00:32:55.07,">> WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN?"
696,00:33:01.00,00:33:01.00,>> MIKE'S STILL GOING TO BE HERE.
697,00:33:03.37,00:33:03.37,YOU'LL BE HERE.
698,00:33:03.73,00:33:03.73,>> I WAS THINKING DAN.
699,00:33:06.40,00:33:06.40,DAN'S GOT THIS ADVANTAGE.
700,00:33:07.07,00:33:07.07,>> OKAY.
701,00:33:09.37,00:33:09.37,>> THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE IN THIS GAME WHO HAVE ADVANTAGES
702,00:33:12.50,00:33:12.50,"GOING INTO TONIGHT'S TRIBAL, MIKE HAS AN IDOL, CAROLYN HAS AN"
703,00:33:17.00,00:33:17.00,IDOL AND DAN HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN VOTING.
704,00:33:19.13,00:33:19.13,I WAS CON DURING IF MAYBE WE...
705,00:33:21.27,00:33:21.27,DAN'S ADVANTAGE MAKES HIM A HUGE THREAT IN THIS GAME.
706,00:33:23.43,00:33:23.43,">> OH, HELL YEAH."
707,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,>> DOWN THE ROAD.
708,00:33:26.47,00:33:26.47,>> THE LAST TRIBAL I WAS THE ONE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
709,00:33:29.57,00:33:29.57,"I COULD BE EASILY GOING HOME TONIGHT, SO MY PLAN TONIGHT"
710,00:33:31.93,00:33:31.93,"WOULD BE TO THROW FOUR VOTES AT MIKE, ANOTHER TWO VOTES GO AFTER"
711,00:33:36.07,00:33:36.07,DAN AND WE KNOCK OUT BOTH AN IDOL AND THE ADVANTAGE.
712,00:33:39.63,00:33:39.63,DAN GOES HOME.
713,00:33:45.50,00:33:45.50,">> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 4-3 VOTE, FOUR FOR ME, AND I'M"
714,00:33:52.13,00:33:52.13,VOTING TYLER.
715,00:33:54.93,00:33:54.93,>> MIKE IS GUNNING FOR TYLER.
716,00:33:57.47,00:33:57.47,AND THIS COULD BE THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SIDE WITH
717,00:34:01.93,00:34:01.93,HIM.
718,00:34:03.00,00:34:03.00,BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT MOVE TO MAKE RIGHT NOW.
719,00:34:07.20,00:34:07.20,">> I REALLY, REALLY, HOPE MAMA C IS 100% ON BOARD WITH ME RIGHT"
720,00:34:11.73,00:34:11.73,NOW BECAUSE MY OPTIONS OF WHO TO WORK WITH AT THIS POINT ARE A
721,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,LITTLE BIT LIMITED.
722,00:34:17.77,00:34:17.77,>> I TALKED TO WILL.
723,00:34:20.57,00:34:20.57,HE AND I ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.
724,00:34:24.57,00:34:24.57,>> DAN.
725,00:34:25.23,00:34:25.23,>> SO YOU GUYS WILL VOTE MIKE.
726,00:34:27.03,00:34:27.03,THAT'S FOUR VOTES MIKE.
727,00:34:27.93,00:34:27.93,HE HAS TO PLAY HIS IDOL.
728,00:34:31.00,00:34:31.00,HE'LL PLAY IT FOR SURE.
729,00:34:33.03,00:34:33.03,"AND THEN YOU, ME AND WILL VOTE DAN."
730,00:34:35.10,00:34:35.10,>> THAT ADVANTAGE IS GOING TO COME BACK THE HAUNT US IF WE
731,00:34:38.23,00:34:38.23,DON'T GET RID OF IT NOW.
732,00:34:39.30,00:34:39.30,>> I KNOW.
733,00:34:43.97,00:34:43.97,>> IT'S A TOSS-UP BETWEEN DAN AND TYLER AS TO WHO NEEDS TO GO
734,00:34:48.53,00:34:48.53,FIRST.
735,00:34:49.30,00:34:49.30,TYLER AND I HAVE A BOND.
736,00:34:50.60,00:34:50.60,"WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE LITERALLY DAY THREE, BUT HE'S"
737,00:34:54.30,00:34:54.30,"THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS I HAVE AN IDOL, SO HE CAN BLOW UP MY GAME."
738,00:34:58.90,00:34:58.90,"BUT DAN'S ADVANTAGE GIVES HIM AN EXTRA VOTE, SO THAT'S A BIG"
739,00:35:05.20,00:35:05.20,THREAT.
740,00:35:11.20,00:35:11.20,"YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GAME FOR $1 MILLION, AND I'M HERE TO PLAY"
741,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,"THE PLAY THE GAME, SO GAME ON, BOYS AND GIRLS."
742,00:35:34.47,00:35:34.47,>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
743,00:35:41.57,00:35:41.57,"HALI, JOE, JENN AND SHIRIN VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL."
744,00:35:48.93,00:35:48.93,ALL RIGHT.
745,00:35:49.47,00:35:49.47,"SO, MIKE, LAST FEW TRIBALS IT'S BEEN A TIGHT PICK."
746,00:35:53.37,00:35:53.37,"I'M GUESSING TONIGHT THEY WOULD LOVE TO TAKE OUT YOU, BUT BASED"
747,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,"ON THE LAST TRIBAL, YOU HAVE YOUR HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL."
748,00:35:59.33,00:35:59.33,">> I BELIEVE I HAVE IT WITH ME TONIGHT, THAT'S FOR SURE."
749,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,"SO ONE OF THE SIX WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT, THAT'S GUARANTEED."
750,00:36:06.23,00:36:06.23,>> Jeff: SO WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED TONIGHT?
751,00:36:08.47,00:36:08.47,>> I BELIEVE THAT TYLER SHOULD BE WORRIED.
752,00:36:10.60,00:36:10.60,I BELIEVE THAT DAN SHOULD BE WORRIED.
753,00:36:12.40,00:36:12.40,"I MEAN, JEFF, I'M ENJOYING THIS TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST."
754,00:36:15.93,00:36:15.93,I'VE BEEN ROOTING FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE SOME THINKING FOR THREE
755,00:36:18.60,00:36:18.60,TRIBAL COUNCILS NOW.
756,00:36:20.03,00:36:20.03,"I MEAN, I GOT THE FIREWORKS OUT, THE POPCORN, SOME PEPSI."
757,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,">> IF YOU HAVE PEPSI AND POPCORN, PLEASE GIVE ME SOME"
758,00:36:28.53,00:36:28.53,BECAUSE I'M ABOUT 150 POUNDS AND I'M STARVING.
759,00:36:32.30,00:36:32.30,"[LAUGHTER] >> Jeff: DAN, ALSO AT THE LAST"
760,00:36:34.07,00:36:34.07,"TRIBAL, YOU GOT TWO VOTES."
761,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,AND I HAVE TO GUESS THAT IT WAS A SURPRISE.
762,00:36:37.90,00:36:37.90,>> YEAH.
763,00:36:38.57,00:36:38.57,AND I DID FIND OUT RIGHT AWAY WHO BOTH OF THEM WERE.
764,00:36:43.17,00:36:43.17,IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU SEE YOUR NAME WRITTEN DOWN.
765,00:36:45.10,00:36:45.10,NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.
766,00:36:46.20,00:36:46.20,AS MUCH AS NOBODY WANTED TO SAY WHO WAS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE
767,00:36:50.00,00:36:50.00,"SIX, THAT PAINTED A PRETTY CAREER PICTURE TO ME."
768,00:36:52.63,00:36:52.63,>> Jeff: SO HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT IT MIGHT BE YOU?
769,00:36:55.13,00:36:55.13,>> I'M GREATLY CONCERNED.
770,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,">> Jeff: TYLER, WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE?"
771,00:37:01.50,00:37:01.50,"YOU GO BACK TO CAMP, DID YOU SCRAMBLE THIS AFTERNOON?"
772,00:37:05.80,00:37:05.80,">> I DON'T KNOW IF I CALL IT SCRAMBLING, BUT I TOOK A"
773,00:37:08.80,00:37:08.80,AMENDMENT OR TWO TO TOUCH BASE WITH EVERYBODY THAT I'VE BEEN
774,00:37:11.13,00:37:11.13,"ALIGNED WITH AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER, BUT MIKE IS A"
775,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03,CHARISMATIC GUY.
776,00:37:14.73,00:37:14.73,I'VE BEEN ON HIS CHOPPING BLOCK FOR A WHILE NOW.

778,00:37:23.47,00:37:23.47,ADVANTAGE THAT DAN GOT AT THE AUCTION?
779,00:37:24.87,00:37:24.87,>> I THINK EVERYONE HAS SPECULATED ON IT.
780,00:37:27.03,00:37:27.03,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT I HOPE IT WAS WORTH $480."
781,00:37:32.93,00:37:32.93,">> Jeff: CAROLYN, THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF CONCERN THAT DAN"
782,00:37:36.90,00:37:36.90,"HAS THIS ADVANTAGE, THERE'S ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT, SIX AFTER"
783,00:37:39.63,00:37:39.63,TONIGHT.
784,00:37:39.87,00:37:39.87,>> IT'S SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
785,00:37:42.57,00:37:42.57,ADVANTAGE IS.
786,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,"IT COULD BE ANOTHER HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, IT COULD BE THE"
787,00:37:46.57,00:37:46.57,"SPECIAL POWERS IDOL THAT TONY HAD, SO AN ADVANTAGE IS SOMEWHAT"
788,00:37:49.97,00:37:49.97,OF A THREAT.
789,00:37:52.23,00:37:52.23,">> Jeff: DAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE APPROACHED YOU AND SAID,"
790,00:37:55.20,00:37:55.20,"LET'S USE IT, TELL ME WHAT IT IS AND MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN."

792,00:38:02.43,00:38:02.43,PEOPLE KNOW WHAT MY ADVANTAGE IS OR NOT IS ACTUALLY IRRELEVANT.
793,00:38:06.27,00:38:06.27,THEY KNOW I HAVE AN ADVANTAGE.
794,00:38:08.37,00:38:08.37,THAT ALL BY ITSELF MAKES ME A BIGGER TARGET.
