559,00:29:59.30,00:29:59.30,TO DECIDE BETWEEN JOE AND JENN GOING HOME.
560,00:30:05.00,00:30:05.00,">> IT WILL PROBABLY BE FOUR HIM, FOUR YOU?"
561,00:30:13.67,00:30:13.67,>> LOOK AT THE DREAMY LOOK IN YOUR EYES.

566,00:30:29.13,00:30:29.13,CARE.
567,00:30:29.83,00:30:29.83,>> I'D SAY 4-3.

574,00:30:47.90,00:30:47.90,>> THE SCARY THING ABOUT SPLITTING THE VOTE IS LITERALLY
575,00:30:51.50,00:30:51.50,ONE PERSON COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHO YOU WANT TO GO
576,00:30:53.73,00:30:53.73,HOME AND THE GOAT GOING HOME.
577,00:30:56.10,00:30:56.10,SO I WANT SHIRIN TO VOTE JOE TONIGHT IN ORDER TO GET JOE OUT
578,00:30:59.97,00:30:59.97,OF THIS GAME.
579,00:31:04.07,00:31:04.07,"WE ARE DEFINITELY SPLITTING THE VOTE, AND YOU'RE VOTING FOR JOE."
580,00:31:08.87,00:31:08.87,YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
581,00:31:09.83,00:31:09.83,>> YEAH.

583,00:31:14.80,00:31:14.80,>> YEAH.
584,00:31:15.40,00:31:15.40,>> HE COULD VOTE JENN AND THEN JENN GOES HOME.
585,00:31:21.60,00:31:21.60,SO THE MORE VOTES WE HAVE FOR JOE THE BETTER.
586,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,>> YEAH.
587,00:31:24.43,00:31:24.43,"THE THOUGHT OF VOTING BETWEEN JOE AND JENN, ON THE ONE HAND, I"
588,00:31:27.83,00:31:27.83,NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE IN A POSITION TO VOTE FOR AN ACTUAL
589,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,FRIEND OF MINE OUT OF THIS GAME.
590,00:31:32.17,00:31:32.17,"EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTS IT, I WANT TO RESPECT HER WISHES AND LET"
591,00:31:35.73,00:31:35.73,"HER LEAVE THIS GAME IN PEACE, BUT THE OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW"
592,00:31:39.07,00:31:39.07,IS THAT JOE IS A MUCH BIGGER THREAT.
593,00:31:40.73,00:31:40.73,>> THE NEXT VOTE IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE GO TO THE
594,00:31:43.80,00:31:43.80,FINAL FOUR OR NOT.
