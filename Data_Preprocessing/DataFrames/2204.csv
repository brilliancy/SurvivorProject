201,00:12:10.33,00:12:10.33,>> Jeff: RUSSELL IS IT SADNESS THAT YOU'RE OUT OF THE GAME?
202,00:12:14.54,00:12:14.54,IS IT EMBARRASSMENT AT FINALLY LOSING?
203,00:12:16.25,00:12:16.25,>> NO. I RESPECT THIS GAME TOO MUCH TO

212,00:12:40.75,00:12:40.75,>> I DON'T REALLY THINK SO. I THINK WE'VE DONE GREAT.
213,00:12:44.71,00:12:44.71,RUSSELL WOULD NOT SHOW US THE HIDDEN CLUE OR WHERE THE IDOL
214,00:12:47.50,00:12:47.50,WAS HIDDEN. BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.
215,00:12:50.21,00:12:50.21,I'D ALREADY FOUND IT IN 15 SECONDS IN THE GAME.
216,00:12:52.33,00:12:52.33,HE'S GOT COMPETITION ON HIS HANDS NOW.
217,00:12:53.83,00:12:53.83,>> LISTEN TO HIM TALKING. HE SAID HE FOUND IT 15 SECONDS
218,00:12:56.12,00:12:56.12,IN THE GAME. DID YOU SHOW ME THE IDOL?

256,00:14:26.92,00:14:26.92,THEY JUST CAME HERE MAYBE FOR FAME OR JUST FOR THE MONEY.
257,00:14:29.33,00:14:29.33,THIS IS MY LAST TIME PLAYING THIS GAME.
258,00:14:31.67,00:14:31.67,THAT'S IT. I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO PROVE TO
259,00:14:35.79,00:14:35.79,"MYSELF OR TO MY FAMILY. MATT, I GIVE HIM PROPS, BEATING"
260,00:14:41.17,00:14:41.17,"ME, AND I HOPE HE GOES ALL THE WAY."

265,00:14:54.50,00:14:54.50,AWAIT YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

271,00:15:01.21,00:15:01.21,"AS ALWAYS, WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO SHARE WITH YOUR TRIBEMATES, IS"
272,00:15:03.21,00:15:03.21,UP TO YOU.
273,00:15:05.12,00:15:05.12,>> THANKS TO RUSSELL I'VE LEARNED SOME VERY INTERESTING
274,00:15:07.12,00:15:07.12,THINGS TODAY AND I'M GOING TO USE THAT TO HELP ME.
275,00:15:10.67,00:15:10.67,"AFTER ALL IT IS THE GAME OF ""SURVIVOR--"" OUTLAST, OUTWIT,"
276,00:15:15.25,00:15:15.25,OUTPLAY. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE TO TRY TO
277,00:15:16.79,00:15:16.79,DO.
278,00:15:28.33,00:15:28.33,>> WE SHOULD HAVE A BEACH DAY TODAY.
279,00:15:30.12,00:15:30.12,IT'S GOING TO BE A BEACH DAY.
280,00:15:31.17,00:15:31.17,>> I'M SO GLAD THEY VOLUNTEERED.
281,00:15:32.67,00:15:32.67,">> WE CAN PUT A BLANKET ON THE BEACH, A CRAB BOIL, RICE."
282,00:15:37.54,00:15:37.54,>> SOUND GOOD TO ME.
283,00:15:41.88,00:15:41.88,>> I STARTED THINKING I NEED TO FIND THE
284,00:15:45.75,00:15:45.75,HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL BEFORE KRISTINA FINDS IT AGAIN.
285,00:15:51.62,00:15:51.62,I ALREADY HAD THE CLUE AND I HAD A GOOD IDEA IT WAS ON THIS SIDE
286,00:15:54.25,00:15:54.25,OF CAMP AND I NEEDED TO GET EVERYBODY OUT OF CAMP FOR THE
287,00:15:56.50,00:15:56.50,DAY. SO I CREATED THIS GAME.
288,00:16:01.29,00:16:01.29,WE'RE CALLING IT ROYAL TREATMENT.
289,00:16:02.71,00:16:02.71,THE WINNER GETS WHATEVER THEY WANT.
290,00:16:04.12,00:16:04.12,YOU CAN GET YOUR RICE SERVED TO YOU BY WHOEVER YOU WANT.
291,00:16:07.88,00:16:07.88,SO I'M TRYING TO THINK HOW AM I GOING TO GET AWAY FROM EVERYBODY
292,00:16:11.83,00:16:11.83,AFTER I'M THE ONE THAT PLANNED THIS WHOLE BEACH DAY.
293,00:16:15.29,00:16:15.29,"MY STOMACH'S BOTHERING ME A LITTLE BIT, TOO."
294,00:16:17.12,00:16:17.12,>> IT IS.
295,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,">> MAYBE, LIKE, CONSTIPATED?"
296,00:16:19.12,00:16:19.12,">> OH, NO."
297,00:16:20.42,00:16:20.42,>> SO I TELL THEM I'M HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE MOVING
298,00:16:23.92,00:16:23.92,"THINGS DOWN IN THAT AREA, YOU KNOW, AND I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING"
299,00:16:27.96,00:16:27.96,MIGHT BE HAPPENING.
300,00:16:29.08,00:16:29.08,>> HOW FAR DOWN? OR WE'RE GOING WAY PAST.
301,00:16:30.12,00:16:30.12,"THAT'S A LONG TREK, BRO."
302,00:16:34.29,00:16:34.29,>> THIS LOOKS GOOD.
303,00:16:36.00,00:16:36.00,>> SO I BRING THEM TO THE NICE PART OF THE BEACH WHERE THE SAND
304,00:16:38.54,00:16:38.54,"IS REALLY NICE, AND IMMEDIATELY, GRANT HEADS INTO THE OCEAN,"
305,00:16:41.62,00:16:41.62,"PERFECT, I DON'T HAVE TO EVEN LOOK GRANT IN THE EYE."
306,00:16:44.12,00:16:44.12,I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE AN EXCUSE. THEY'LL COVER FOR ME.
307,00:16:46.75,00:16:46.75,"SO I LOOK AT THE GIRLS AND I SAID, ""IT'S TIME."
308,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,"I HAVE TO TRY TO RELIEVE MYSELF."""
309,00:16:59.38,00:16:59.38,I KNEW I HAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.
310,00:17:01.75,00:17:01.75,"SO I HIGH-TAILED IT BACK TO CAMP, AND IT'S LIKE GAME ON."
311,00:17:05.25,00:17:05.25,"WHERE IS THIS THING? THE CLUE, IT BASICALLY TOLD ME"
312,00:17:10.71,00:17:10.71,"IT'S SOMEWHERE ON THE ISLAND, EITHER IN A TREE, UNDER A ROCK,"
313,00:17:14.21,00:17:14.21,"IN THE SAND, OR IN A LOG. WHAT A GREAT CLUE."
314,00:17:19.79,00:17:19.79,THIS IS A REALLY WEIRD TREE. THERE'S ROCKS.
315,00:17:23.79,00:17:23.79,IT SHOULD BE HERE. I'M DIGGING THROUGH ROCKS.
316,00:17:34.75,00:17:34.75,I'M CLIMBING TREES. I'M LOOKING EVERYWHERE.
317,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,AND I'M HAVING A REALLY TOUGH TIME.
318,00:17:40.33,00:17:40.33,SO I JUST STARTED SEARCHING FROM TREE TO TREE.
319,00:17:44.92,00:17:44.92,>> WHERE'S ROB?
320,00:17:49.42,00:17:49.42,">> AT THIS POINT, I'VE ALREADY BEEN GONE FOR 15 MINUTES."
321,00:17:52.50,00:17:52.50,"I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE BEACH. OTHERWISE, IT'S GOING TO LOOK"
322,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,SUSPICIOUS. WHERE IS IT?
323,00:17:58.21,00:17:58.21,"YOU KNOW, THERE'S PROBABLY ABOUT 40 TREES IN OUR IMMEDIATE AREA."
324,00:18:02.21,00:18:02.21,AND I THINK IT WAS MAYBE 38 OR 39 I FINALLY LOOKED UP.
325,00:18:10.04,00:18:10.04,BINGO. DING-DING!
326,00:18:18.08,00:18:18.08,"WE HAVE A WINNER. BABY, MAYBE I LEARNED SOMETHING"
327,00:18:22.62,00:18:22.62,"SINCE LAST TIME. AS FOR MY PLANS FOR IT, RIGHT"
328,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,"NOW, I'M NOT SURE."
329,00:18:27.21,00:18:27.21,>> DO YOU FEEL BETTER?
330,00:18:29.42,00:18:29.42,>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
331,00:18:31.29,00:18:31.29,"BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT WITH THIS IMMUNITY IDOL, THIS"
332,00:18:34.54,00:18:34.54,TIME I'M GOING TO MAKE IT 39 DAYS AND WIN.
333,00:18:39.21,00:18:39.21,>> OH!
334,00:18:41.17,00:18:41.17,>> YOU BLEW IT! YOU BLEW IT!
335,00:18:42.83,00:18:42.83,>> I WAS GOING FOR THE WIN.
336,00:18:51.62,00:18:51.62,">> HI, THERE!"
337,00:18:53.29,00:18:53.29,>> HEY!
338,00:18:55.12,00:18:55.12,>> THAT WAS CRAZY!
339,00:18:56.58,00:18:56.58,">> YEAH, SO MUCH STUFF WENT DOWN."
340,00:18:59.08,00:18:59.08,"FIRST THEY COME OUT, AND THEY STARTED THE CHALLENGE, WHICH WAS"
341,00:19:01.96,00:19:01.96,"REALLY HARD. BUT IN THE END, MATT WON."
342,00:19:05.21,00:19:05.21,>> WOW.
343,00:19:07.21,00:19:07.21,>> I AM STOKED THAT RUSSELL'S OUT OF THE GAME.
344,00:19:09.71,00:19:09.71,I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT. OUR PLAN WORKED.
345,00:19:12.92,00:19:12.92,AND I AM SO RELIEVED THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO COME BACK AND GET
346,00:19:16.50,00:19:16.50,ME. HE'S GONE!
347,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,YA! HE'S GONE!
348,00:19:19.25,00:19:19.25,">> RUSSELL WAS DEVASTATED. LIKE, HE WAS CRYING SO I"
349,00:19:22.92,00:19:22.92,HYSTERICALLY.
350,00:19:23.29,00:19:23.29,>> HE WAS?
351,00:19:24.12,00:19:24.12,>> IT WAS AWFUL TO SEE.
352,00:19:24.71,00:19:24.71,>> IT WAS TERRIBLE.
353,00:19:26.04,00:19:26.04,">> AND THEN HE FOUND HIS RUSSELLNESS, AND JUST BASICALLY"
354,00:19:30.67,00:19:30.67,THREW BACK THE COVERS ON EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR CAMP.
355,00:19:33.12,00:19:33.12,"LIKE, HE JUST STARTED THROWING OUT THE HIT."
356,00:19:36.08,00:19:36.08,"THE POINT IS, HE'S OUT."
357,00:19:37.50,00:19:37.50,">> SEE YOU, PUNK."
358,00:19:40.38,00:19:40.38,">> OH, NOW YOU'RE GOING TOO MUCH."
359,00:19:42.83,00:19:42.83,>> STEPHANIE AND KRISTA SHOWED SOME EMOTION THAT INDICATED THEY
360,00:19:45.92,00:19:45.92,"WERE STILL IN CAMP RUSSELL, WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND."
361,00:19:50.29,00:19:50.29,I THINK THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS KIND OF DANCING ON HIS
362,00:19:53.08,00:19:53.08,"GRAVE, YOU KNOW, ADDED INSULT TO INJURY."
363,00:19:55.12,00:19:55.12,>> THAT MATT KID SOUNDS PRETTY TOUGH.
364,00:19:57.08,00:19:57.08,I'M AMAZED THAT THEY GOT RID OF HIM.
365,00:19:59.12,00:19:59.12,">> PEOPLE DO SOME DUMB STUFF, YOU KNOW, LIKE THROW CHALLENGES"
366,00:20:02.79,00:20:02.79,WHEN THEY'RE AHEAD.
367,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,>> THE TRIBE IS MUCH STRONGER. HE WAS BREAKING DOWN THE SYNERGY
368,00:20:06.88,00:20:06.88,IN OUR TRIBE.
369,00:20:08.12,00:20:08.12,">> IN THE GAME OF NUMBERS, SYNERGY IS THE LAST THING YOU"
370,00:20:10.58,00:20:10.58,SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT.
371,00:20:12.08,00:20:12.08,>> I DISAGREE. WHEN YOU'RE BATTLING AGAINST THE
372,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,OTHER TEAM I THINK SYNERGY AND CHEMISTRY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
373,00:20:16.96,00:20:16.96,THING. WE HAD TO LOSE ONE AT ONE POINT
374,00:20:19.83,00:20:19.83,TO GET RID OF THE PLAGUE.
375,00:20:26.38,00:20:26.38,">> OKAY, LISTEN, WHEN WE GO BACK, WE'RE GOING TO TELL THEM"
376,00:20:29.88,00:20:29.88,ABOUT THE BREAKDOWN THAT RUSSELL HAD.
377,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL THEM IS WHO HAS IMMUNITY IDOLS.
378,00:20:36.12,00:20:36.12,YOU'RE GOING TO LET ME GO TO ROB.

609,00:31:22.29,00:31:22.29,I KNOW WE'RE ALL FEELING A LITTLE DOWN RIGHT NOW.

627,00:32:13.71,00:32:13.71,THAT'S HIGHWAY BAD I CAN'T STAND HIM.
628,00:32:15.58,00:32:15.58,AND I THINK WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.
629,00:32:18.33,00:32:18.33,"BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT TO GO TO TRIBAL TONIGHT SO WE MIGHT AS"
630,00:32:21.92,00:32:21.92,WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT. I JUST HOPE PHILLIP GOES HOME!
631,00:32:26.12,00:32:26.12,>> GET YOUR ASS UP HERE.

633,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,REALLY WANT TO HAVE TO ENDURE IS PHILLIP'S YAMMERING.
634,00:32:38.17,00:32:38.17,GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT I'M THINKING IT'S MYSELF OR
635,00:32:41.17,00:32:41.17,PHILLIP GOING HOME. I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE
636,00:32:43.96,00:32:43.96,NUMBERS IN THIS TRIBE. I HAVE BEEN SINCE DAY ONE.
637,00:32:46.92,00:32:46.92,"AT THE SAME TIME, THEY MIGHT VOTE FOR PHILLIP BECAUSE HE DOES"
638,00:32:50.17,00:32:50.17,"ANNOY EVERYBODY. SO I THINK I HAVE A GOOD CHANCE,"
639,00:32:52.42,00:32:52.42,"BUT IF I HAD THE IDOL IN MY POCKET, I'D FEEL BETTER."
640,00:32:57.21,00:32:57.21,">> WHEN WE WON THE REWARD, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A CLUE."
641,00:33:01.21,00:33:01.21,I'D BE SURPRISED IF THEY HAVEN'T FOUND IT.
642,00:33:04.21,00:33:04.21,>> WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?
643,00:33:07.00,00:33:07.00,>> YOU.
644,00:33:08.25,00:33:08.25,>> KRISTINA IS KIND OF ACTING WEIRD.

646,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,STRANGE. COULD MEAN THAT SHE HAS IT.
647,00:33:20.42,00:33:20.42,COULD MEAN THAT SHE DOESN'T. I DON'T KNOW.
648,00:33:26.58,00:33:26.58,"SHE GOES, ""WELL, I GUESS THE IDOL'S IN PLAY NOW GAIN."""
649,00:33:31.42,00:33:31.42,"AND I'M LIKE, ""WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?"""
650,00:33:34.21,00:33:34.21,"AND SHE'S LIKE, ""WELL, SOMEBODY MUST HAVE FOUND THE CLUE."""

654,00:33:44.21,00:33:44.21,>> EXACTLY.
655,00:33:45.50,00:33:45.50,>> LIKE I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. APPARENTLY KRISTINA HAS BEEN
656,00:33:49.50,00:33:49.50,SNOOPING AROUND ABOUT THE IDOL. SHE'S DANGEROUS.
657,00:33:52.12,00:33:52.12,AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY HATES PHILLIP HE'S LESS OF A THREAT TO
658,00:33:55.50,00:33:55.50,ME THAN KRISTINA IS. THIS IS WHAT I THINK.
659,00:33:58.25,00:33:58.25,WE SEND HER ASS HOME.  WHY TAKE A CHANCE?
660,00:34:02.79,00:34:02.79,JUST SPLIT. I DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY
661,00:34:04.08,00:34:04.08,THAT I HAVE THE IDOL. I WANT THEM TO THINK KRISTINA
662,00:34:07.17,00:34:07.17,HAS IT SO WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTES.
663,00:34:09.58,00:34:09.58,"WE'RE GOING TO THROW THREE VOTES ON CHRISTINE, TWO VOTES ON"

667,00:34:29.08,00:34:29.08,HAVING HIM AROUND.

673,00:34:40.46,00:34:40.46,BUT I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE. PHILLIP IS JUST A LOOSE CANNON.
674,00:34:44.25,00:34:44.25,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
675,00:34:45.50,00:34:45.50,"I DON'T TRUST HIM, DUDE."
676,00:34:46.79,00:34:46.79,">> I DON'T, EITHER."

685,00:35:05.29,00:35:05.29,ARE OBSESSED WITH GETTING PHILLIP OUT.
686,00:35:08.75,00:35:08.75,SO IT QUITE CONCEIVABLY COULD BE THAT SOMEBODY WITHIN MY ALLIANCE
687,00:35:14.08,00:35:14.08,MIGHT BE WILLING TO FLIP AND VOTE OUT PHILLIP.
688,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,"HONESTLY, AS LONG ASHLEY STAYS ON BOARD AND GRANT STAYS ON"
689,00:35:21.21,00:35:21.21,BOARD THEN WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR.

694,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,>> I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS. WE'RE ALL VOTING FOR KRISTINA.
695,00:35:40.17,00:35:40.17,>> OKAY.
696,00:35:41.12,00:35:41.12,">> SURE ENOUGH, ROB WANTS TO VOTE KRISTINA."
697,00:35:43.92,00:35:43.92,"CLEARLY, HE'S NOT A MAN OF HIS WORD."

699,00:35:50.58,00:35:50.58,BE READY TO MAKE THE MOVES YOU NEED TO MAKE TO SURVIVE.
700,00:35:53.08,00:35:53.08,>> I'M READY TO GO.
