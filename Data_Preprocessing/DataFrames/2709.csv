222,00:13:13.77,00:13:13.77,VOTES OR IS THAT GOING TO MAKE ME TOO BIG OF A TARGET?
223,00:13:16.30,00:13:16.30,I DON'T WANT TO TELL PEOPLE I HAVE THE IDOL SO I HAVE TO JUST
224,00:13:19.07,00:13:19.07,ROLL WITH IT. HE'S COMING UP THE BEACH RIGHT

243,00:14:12.87,00:14:12.87,"GAME COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER 12 DAYS IN THIS GAME, COULD LEAD TO"
244,00:14:15.97,00:14:15.97,$1 MILLION. IT'S SCRATCHING AND CLAWING TO
245,00:14:17.83,00:14:17.83,"GET THROUGH TONIGHT'S TRIBAL. AT THIS POINT, I'LL PUT KATIE'S"
246,00:14:21.63,00:14:21.63,NAME DOWN IF IT GETS ME FURTHER. I THINK IN THE END IT'S JUST
247,00:14:25.70,00:14:25.70,ABOUT NOT TURNING ON EACH OTHER. I'M NOT TURNING OW GIRLS.
248,00:14:29.93,00:14:29.93,">> WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUS, BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?"
249,00:14:31.90,00:14:31.90,>> I'M IN A VERY TIGHT JAM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALLIANCES
250,00:14:34.90,00:14:34.90,PEOPLE HAVE RIGHT NOW. MY MOM TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO DO
251,00:14:37.67,00:14:37.67,WHAT'S BEST FOR ME. SO I NEED TO FIGURE OUT A
252,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33,DIFFERENT GAME POLICEMAN PLAN. WHETHER THAT INCLUDES JUST ME OR
253,00:14:43.07,00:14:43.07,MY AND MY MOTHER. >> I'M GETTING NERVOUS.
254,00:14:50.13,00:14:50.13,SEVEN US MADE A PACT THAT WE WILL SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN
255,00:14:54.00,00:14:54.00,VYTAS AND KATIE. SO THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN WAS.
256,00:14:58.70,00:14:58.70,"HOWEVER, I'M NOT REALLY QUITE SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING OR WHO IS"
257,00:15:03.20,00:15:03.20,SAYING WHAT OR WHO'S DRIVING THE BOAT.
258,00:15:06.47,00:15:06.47,BUT WHY THE SUDDEN SCRAMBLE? IT MAKES ME FEEL VERY
259,00:15:10.30,00:15:10.30,UNCOMFORTABLE. >> I JUST FEEL LIKE WAS IT ME
260,00:15:12.80,00:15:12.80,GOING HOME TONIGHT. SO THERE'S THIS MAD SCRAMBLE.
261,00:15:16.23,00:15:16.23,>> YOU WON. >> THE BOYS ARE VOTING VYTAS.
262,00:15:18.57,00:15:18.57,">> AND WE'RE ALL WRITING KATIE. >> ALL RIGHT, KATIE."
263,00:15:21.03,00:15:21.03,>> THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE I'M LAYING HERE THINKING THERE'S A
264,00:15:23.57,00:15:23.57,WHOLE LOT OF SCRAMBLING GOING ON.
265,00:15:25.80,00:15:25.80,IT MUST HAVE BEEN ME TONIGHT. >> MONICA'S ASKING WHY EVERYBODY
266,00:15:31.63,00:15:31.63,IS SCRAMBLING AROUND? WHY THE DOES SHE CARE?
267,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,SHE HAS THE NECKLACE. YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
268,00:15:37.63,00:15:37.63,THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW PARNOTIFIED A PERSON MONICA IS.
269,00:15:43.43,00:15:43.43,>> I KNOW THERE'S SEVEN YOU GUYS.
270,00:15:45.27,00:15:45.27,YOU GOTTA SPLIT FOUR TO THREE SOME WAY.
271,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13,"SPLIT THREE ON ME, PLEASE. >> MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE"
272,00:15:51.43,00:15:51.43,DOING. >> BUT I JUST KIND OF ADD A
273,00:15:53.40,00:15:53.40,LITTLE SALT IN THE WOUND TO GO RIGHT AFTER ARAS LIKE THAT.
274,00:15:56.23,00:15:56.23,>> AND THERE'S ALSO ONE LESS PAIR OUT IF I STAY.
275,00:15:59.77,00:15:59.77,"AS EVIDENCED BY LAST TRIBAL, YOU KNOW, PAIRS ARE DANGEROUS."
276,00:16:04.43,00:16:04.43,">> ALL VALID POINTS. >> AND I'LL PROMISE YOU THIS, IF"
277,00:16:06.80,00:16:06.80,"YOU KEEP ME AROUND ANOTHER ONE, I'M MUCH MORE OPEN TO GIVING YOU"
278,00:16:11.27,00:16:11.27,"MY JURY VOTE AT THE END. AT THIS POINT, THAT'S ALL I HAVE"
279,00:16:14.30,00:16:14.30,LEFT. >> VYTAS MADE SOME VALID POINTS
280,00:16:16.07,00:16:16.07,BUT THE MAIN CONCERN FOR ME RIGHT NOW IS IF THE GIRLS WISE
281,00:16:20.90,00:16:20.90,"UP, THEY COULD PERHAPS FORM AN ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE, SENDING A"
282,00:16:24.77,00:16:24.77,GIRL HOME WOULD KEEP VYTAS HERE AND STILL KEEP THE GUYS IN THE
283,00:16:28.13,00:16:28.13,STRONG MAJORITY. SO MY LIST OPT MALE RIGHT NOW
284,00:16:31.33,00:16:31.33,WOULD BE TO HAVE KATIE GO NEXT. >> SINCE KATIE IS PLAYING HARDER
285,00:16:36.77,00:16:36.77,"RIGHT NOW, WE SHOULD SEND HER. >> THAT'S TRUE."
286,00:16:38.67,00:16:38.67,>> BUT IF WE'RE SOLID IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT ORDER WE DO IT IN.
287,00:16:42.83,00:16:42.83,">> RIGHT, BUT WE SHOULD DECIDE RIGHT NOW."
288,00:16:44.97,00:16:44.97,THEN YOU CAN LET YOUR MOM KNOW. >> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
289,00:16:47.10,00:16:47.10,>> I'LL DO WHATEVER. >> THIS IS WHEN IT GETS
290,00:16:49.63,00:16:49.63,"DANGEROUS FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO COME OFF"
291,00:16:52.00,00:16:52.00,AS THE KINGPIN OR THE DECISION MAKER.
292,00:16:54.83,00:16:54.83,I WANT EVERYONE TO FEEL THEIR INPUT IS WHAT MATTER MATTERS AND NOT
293,00:16:58.40,00:16:58.40,"JUST MINE. SO RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO BE VERY"
294,00:17:00.50,00:17:00.50,"CAREFUL ABOUT THIS VOTE TONIGHT. >> Jeff: TINA, AFTER YOU GET"
295,00:17:27.83,00:17:27.83,"BACK TO CAMP AFTER THE LAST TRIBAL, ARAS HAS BEEN"
296,00:17:31.10,00:17:31.10,"BLINDSIDED, WHAT WENT DOWN? >> WELL, JEFF, IT WAS ONE OF"
