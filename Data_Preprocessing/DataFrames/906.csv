15,00:00:47.50,00:00:47.50,"for Lopevi, Yasur still couldn't catch up."
16,00:00:50.12,00:00:50.12,Ami can't do it. Lopevi wins reward.

20,00:01:00.38,00:01:00.38,the men. >> JULIE: Me and Twila are
21,00:01:02.17,00:01:02.17,trying to weasel our way in there.

23,00:01:07.71,00:01:07.71,women. >> TRAVIS: But being in a tribe
24,00:01:09.71,00:01:09.71,"with a bunch of women-- it does make you nervous, 'cause one"
25,00:01:12.25,00:01:12.25,"wrong move, and they'll vote you out."

34,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,"Bubba was on the hot seat, but Rory learned he was the original"

36,00:01:41.04,00:01:41.04,to be the first one that we had picked if we did lose to go.
37,00:01:44.88,00:01:44.88,">> JEFF: When the votes came in, Bubba paid the ultimate price"
38,00:01:48.12,00:01:48.12,for his big mistake. 12 are left.

41,00:03:10.21,00:03:10.21,"this fire. >> RORY: Yeah, well, apparently,"
42,00:03:12.58,00:03:12.58,"I got to stay warm. >> SCOUT: Well, what does that"
43,00:03:16.83,00:03:16.83,mean? >> RORY: Y'all need to leave me
44,00:03:18.12,00:03:18.12,alone right now. >> ELIZA: Okay.
45,00:03:21.58,00:03:21.58,>> RORY: 'Cause y'all have shown me something that I'm not real
46,00:03:24.08,00:03:24.08,"impressed with, and perhaps for the... for the peace and"
47,00:03:27.92,00:03:27.92,"tranquility of this tribe, it would be best for me to hold my"
48,00:03:31.83,00:03:31.83,tongue until tomorrow morning. Bubba and I both knew that it
49,00:03:35.00,00:03:35.00,was going to be one or the other of us that was going to be
50,00:03:37.67,00:03:37.67,leaving tonight at Tribal Council.
51,00:03:40.25,00:03:40.25,The ladies made a mistake in telling me that I would've been
52,00:03:43.08,00:03:43.08,"eliminated before Bubba was, and so what I'm going to basically"
53,00:03:47.00,00:03:47.00,do is I'm going to play it up. I came to y'all straight up.
54,00:03:54.33,00:03:54.33,I don't know if you guys are so smoked in that you don't even
55,00:03:56.96,00:03:56.96,see honesty when it comes right at y'all.
56,00:03:59.67,00:03:59.67,You got me up on the auction block.
57,00:04:01.79,00:04:01.79,">> SCOUT: No, don't say I got you up on the auction block."
58,00:04:04.58,00:04:04.58,">> RORY: Well, you certainly judged me quick enough."
59,00:04:07.21,00:04:07.21,>> SCOUT: The judgment is that you're sitting right here in
60,00:04:10.17,00:04:10.17,camp. >> RORY: The thing I need to
61,00:04:12.04,00:04:12.04,watch is I can't push these ladies too far.
62,00:04:15.46,00:04:15.46,I just kind of got to balance it and push 'em just far enough to
63,00:04:19.62,00:04:19.62,give myself a little bit of an opening.
64,00:04:22.08,00:04:22.08,"My thing is to come off as the upset, angry brother who is"
65,00:04:27.42,00:04:27.42,welcomed back into the fold. Your little crew just made a
66,00:04:30.92,00:04:30.92,"decision about whether or not y'all want a teammate or not,"
67,00:04:33.38,00:04:33.38,"and if you don't want a teammate, then-then be woman"
68,00:04:36.38,00:04:36.38,enough to let me know. >> SCOUT: All right.
69,00:04:38.62,00:04:38.62,That's a deal. Rory would like to tell
70,00:04:41.29,00:04:41.29,"everybody off right now, but that would just seal his fate."
71,00:04:45.25,00:04:45.25,He's had a fit and fell in it and sitting over there on his
72,00:04:48.17,00:04:48.17,"pity pot, so hopefully, he'll wipe his ass and get off and get"
73,00:04:51.12,00:04:51.12,"over it and, you know, start a new day, and let's see what we"
74,00:04:54.79,00:04:54.79,can make of it. (bird cawing)
75,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17,(man grunting) >> TWILA: I can't get it up on
76,00:05:11.58,00:05:11.58,my shoulder. You guys are taller than I am.
77,00:05:13.25,00:05:13.25,I'll help as much as I can. >> LEA: My new tribe is awesome.
78,00:05:18.04,00:05:18.04,"It's a blessing to have women around, not that we need 'em."
79,00:05:21.79,00:05:21.79,"I'm not saying that we... it'd- it'd be any different, um, one"
80,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,"way or another, but, I mean, it's good to have 'em."
81,00:05:31.75,00:05:31.75,">> JULIE: Do tell. >> LEA: No, no, not this one."
82,00:05:36.17,00:05:36.17,"Not to you, especially. >> CHRIS: It's interesting"
83,00:05:40.25,00:05:40.25,"having a pretty girl playing the game, 'cause somebody like that"
84,00:05:42.08,00:05:42.08,can fly underneath the radar and sweet talk their way into the
85,00:05:45.21,00:05:45.21,"final five, and then, you know, boom, next thing you know,"
86,00:05:47.88,00:05:47.88,they're sitting there waiting to win the money.
87,00:05:50.17,00:05:50.17,>> JULIE: You need to put lotion on your damn shoulders.
88,00:05:52.50,00:05:52.50,Today is my second morning with the new tribe.
89,00:05:55.12,00:05:55.12,Now it's more relaxed but definitely uncertain.
90,00:05:58.12,00:05:58.12,Women are more passive- aggressive than men are.
91,00:06:00.50,00:06:00.50,"I don't know. And, you know, that's all you"
92,00:06:03.04,00:06:03.04,would get over at Yasur. >> TWILA: I can't wait to see
93,00:06:06.12,00:06:06.12,who is gone and what the reward is.
94,00:06:08.04,00:06:08.04,>> JULIE: I'll just laugh if one of the guys is gone.
95,00:06:10.17,00:06:10.17,>> TWILA: I'll laugh if Eliza's gone.
96,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,">> CHAD: Who thinks what? All right, who do you think is"
97,00:06:12.88,00:06:12.88,"going to be gone, Sarge? >> LEA: Uh, Bubba's safe."
98,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,Everybody loves Bubba. >> TWILA: I think everybody kind
99,00:06:17.17,00:06:17.17,of loves Scout. There ain't no doubt about it.
100,00:06:19.08,00:06:19.08,"She's the older, wiser one. >> JULIE: You can't... Yeah."
101,00:06:20.54,00:06:20.54,You can't not appreciate her. >> LEA: So we're supposed to
102,00:06:23.12,00:06:23.12,"love the older person, so we love Twila."
103,00:06:25.54,00:06:25.54,">> TWILA: Thank you. Oh, God, thank you."
104,00:06:28.17,00:06:28.17,"You had to point that out, didn't you?"
105,00:06:29.75,00:06:29.75,>> LEA: Yup. >> JULIE: What are you thinking?
106,00:06:35.29,00:06:35.29,">> TWILA: Oh, I don't know what to think."
107,00:06:37.08,00:06:37.08,"They're being real nice, but we're still the outsiders."
108,00:06:39.79,00:06:39.79,>> JULIE: Completely. >> TWILA: Julie and I actually
109,00:06:41.08,00:06:41.08,talk now. That's more than what I can say
110,00:06:43.04,00:06:43.04,"we ever did over the other tribe, 'cause I never actually"
111,00:06:45.08,00:06:45.08,talked to her over there. We got to keep winning
112,00:06:46.83,00:06:46.83,challenges. The best bet for us is to keep
113,00:06:48.71,00:06:48.71,winning the challenges. That's it.
114,00:06:49.96,00:06:49.96,>> JULIE: I know. >> TWILA: Being the only two
115,00:06:52.17,00:06:52.17,"women over here and four men, we're odd out."
116,00:06:53.71,00:06:53.71,We're both vulnerable. We know it.
117,00:06:55.46,00:06:55.46,"You know, they could be blowing smoke up her ass just like"
118,00:06:57.96,00:06:57.96,"they're blowing smoke up my ass. You know, I don't know."
119,00:07:04.04,00:07:04.04,">> SCOUT: Tree mail, Yasur. >> LISA: It's a pig."
120,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,">> AMI: Is that a pig? >> Oh, my God."
121,00:07:08.75,00:07:08.75,">> LISA: ""You are likely to become exhausted, so here's to"
122,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,"mud in your eye."" Oh, God."

124,00:07:19.25,00:07:19.25,>> ELIZA: Reward. Yeah. >> It's reward.
125,00:07:21.17,00:07:21.17,">> LISA: Maybe with pigs. >> LEANN: Oh, let's wrestle one"
126,00:07:23.08,00:07:23.08,of those suckers. >> SCOUT: Pig wrestling.
127,00:07:25.04,00:07:25.04,"Yasur, let's get our butts out there."
128,00:07:27.04,00:07:27.04,"Come here, Rory. >> AMI: Rory, come on over here."
129,00:07:29.62,00:07:29.62,>> SCOUT: That's a pretty picture right there.
130,00:07:32.04,00:07:32.04,">> Yeah. >> SCOUT: One, two, three."
131,00:07:34.25,00:07:34.25,>> ALL: Yasur! >> LISA: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
132,00:07:36.46,00:07:36.46,">> RORY: I think we should, uh, have a conversation then."
133,00:07:38.71,00:07:38.71,">> SCOUT: Okay. >> RORY: First off, my apologies"
134,00:07:41.62,00:07:41.62,"to all of you for the horrible, horrible things that I said to"
135,00:07:45.17,00:07:45.17,"you in my mind last night. When I get angry, I tend to"
136,00:07:49.12,00:07:49.12,become extraordinarily hurtful. I have come to you all with the
137,00:07:55.75,00:07:55.75,"expectation that you all would give me a fair shot, and I have"
138,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,done my damnedest to prove to you all where my loyalties lie.
139,00:08:08.21,00:08:08.21,"At this point, I can't go back to Lopevi."
140,00:08:12.79,00:08:12.79,"I can't, because Bubba's gone, and what's going to be their"
141,00:08:17.17,00:08:17.17,first thought? I sold Bubba out.
142,00:08:22.17,00:08:22.17,So this is where I'm at right now.
143,00:08:24.67,00:08:24.67,"Your sty is my sty, but I will not continue to slave around"
144,00:08:30.88,00:08:30.88,camp if I do not have a shot at making it through Tribal
145,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,Council. My speech was so cheesy that I
146,00:08:43.25,00:08:43.25,"couldn't even believe I was saying it myself, you know?"
147,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,"I mean, afterwards, I was sitting there thinking, ""Man,"
148,00:08:49.58,00:08:49.58,"there's no way in hell these ladies bought any of that,"" but"
149,00:08:53.46,00:08:53.46,"maybe they did, and if I could sway 'em just a little bit"
150,00:08:56.04,00:08:56.04,"toward favor for me, you got to do what you got to do."
151,00:09:10.33,00:09:10.33,">> JEFF: Yasur, come on in. Lopevi, get your first look at"
152,00:09:16.33,00:09:16.33,the new Yasur tribe. >> CHAD: Whoa...

155,00:09:26.88,00:09:26.88,Shall we get to the challenge? >> LEA: Yeah-ha.
156,00:09:29.25,00:09:29.25,">> JEFF: On the islands of Vanuatu, pigs are highly valued."
157,00:09:32.25,00:09:32.25,"They're currency and they're a status symbol, and right now,"
158,00:09:35.17,00:09:35.17,they have a value to you. >> CHAD: Yeah.
159,00:09:37.12,00:09:37.12,">> JEFF: Today's challenge is for reward, and you're going to"
160,00:09:39.21,00:09:39.21,get good and muddy as a result. >> JULIE: Yeah.
161,00:09:41.88,00:09:41.88,">> JEFF: We have assembled a pen, filled it with pigs."
162,00:09:45.62,00:09:45.62,Your goal: catch the pigs. Five tribe members will be pig
163,00:09:48.33,00:09:48.33,catchers. They're responsible for catching
164,00:09:50.04,00:09:50.04,two pigs each. You can grab two at once or one
165,00:09:53.67,00:09:53.67,at a time. One person will be a gatekeeper.
166,00:09:56.12,00:09:56.12,Their job is to make sure the pigs you catch remain caught.
167,00:09:59.17,00:09:59.17,First tribe to collect ten of their tribe-colored pigs wins
168,00:10:01.17,00:10:01.17,reward. Want to know what you're playing

375,00:19:42.21,00:19:42.21,"their own death warrant, and right now they need somebody"

377,00:19:49.79,00:19:49.79,the only thing that I've hoped for is for there to be a little
378,00:19:53.38,00:19:53.38,"fissure, a little tiny crack in that union of women, and I think"
379,00:19:57.12,00:19:57.12,I just found my little tiny crack.

391,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,"pretty good. I mean, I took a quick peek but"
392,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,"I wasn't going to stare at it, but it looked real good."
393,00:20:58.96,00:20:58.96,"I mean, if you got it, sunbathe it."

408,00:21:50.79,00:21:50.79,"I'd drink a beer with Twila, I'd go to the race with Twila."
409,00:21:58.75,00:21:58.75,>> TWILA: Coming down. >> LEA: I also would put a dress
410,00:22:02.08,00:22:02.08,on Twila and go out to dinner with her because she is a lady.

415,00:22:13.67,00:22:13.67,">> TWILA: She said she didn't know either, after the way it"

418,00:22:20.67,00:22:20.67,"go against us. She'd be a fool, because we're"
419,00:22:23.42,00:22:23.42,going to keep her around as long as Lopevi's strong.
420,00:22:27.25,00:22:27.25,"Chris, Chad and I, we're three. Three is a real odd number."
421,00:22:31.67,00:22:31.67,"Four is always better, and so I went ahead and gave her my word,"
422,00:22:35.33,00:22:35.33,"and I said, ""Twila you've got my word as a man you are in the"

442,00:23:41.62,00:23:41.62,going to wear you out. Four tribe members will start on
443,00:23:44.79,00:23:44.79,"a floating platform, where you will find eight wooden tiki"
444,00:23:47.96,00:23:47.96,pieces. Each tribe member must transport
445,00:23:50.50,00:23:50.50,two tiki pieces to the beach by moving them along a rope through
446,00:23:54.25,00:23:54.25,"a water obstacle course. The first stage, you must"
447,00:23:57.17,00:23:57.17,maneuver the pieces around an outrigger canoe.
448,00:23:59.38,00:23:59.38,"For the second stage, you must get the pieces and yourself up"
449,00:24:02.46,00:24:02.46,and over a wall. For the third stage you'll go
450,00:24:05.21,00:24:05.21,underwater and maneuver the pieces through three hitching
451,00:24:07.58,00:24:07.58,posts. And for the final stage you must
452,00:24:10.21,00:24:10.21,maneuver the pieces through a truss.
453,00:24:12.04,00:24:12.04,"Once you have the pieces up on the beach and in their trough,"
454,00:24:14.62,00:24:14.62,the next person can go. Once all eight pieces are in the
455,00:24:17.75,00:24:17.75,"trough, the final two tribe members assemble the tiki."
456,00:24:21.12,00:24:21.12,"First tribe to assemble the tiki correctly wins immunity,"
457,00:24:24.50,00:24:24.50,guaranteed one more day out here.

554,00:31:10.17,00:31:10.17,not enough. Tonight the seventh person will
555,00:31:12.17,00:31:12.17,"be voted out of this game, and they're coming from your tribe."
556,00:31:15.04,00:31:15.04,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
557,00:31:17.04,00:31:17.04,Head on back to camp. >> Whoo!
558,00:31:22.67,00:31:22.67,>> Ow! (bird singing)

560,00:31:45.04,00:31:45.04,team down. And I... I really didn't want
561,00:31:47.38,00:31:47.38,anybody to go home. And it was so draining.
562,00:31:51.42,00:31:51.42,That's why I'm an emotional mess.
563,00:32:01.92,00:32:01.92,">> ELIZA: Seriously though, seriously, how strong were you?"
564,00:32:05.08,00:32:05.08,>> LEANN: I just feel so bad. >> ELIZA: Trust me.

566,00:32:12.62,00:32:12.62,"I mean, don't worry. >> LEANN: No, I feel as if I"
567,00:32:16.58,00:32:16.58,should go home because I screwed up so bad.
568,00:32:20.21,00:32:20.21,"But at the same time, I so don't want to go home."
569,00:32:25.04,00:32:25.04,>> SCOUT: Getting to get over it?
570,00:32:26.29,00:32:26.29,How long does it take you to get over it?
571,00:32:28.04,00:32:28.04,>> LEANN: I just want to be here tomorrow.
572,00:32:30.04,00:32:30.04,>> ELIZA: I don't think there's any doubt in anyone's mind that
573,00:32:33.79,00:32:33.79,you will be. >> LEANN: You guys make me feel
574,00:32:37.75,00:32:37.75,like the best loser ever. And then I feel guilty because
575,00:32:41.33,00:32:41.33,"if I don't go home, someone else is going to go home because of"
576,00:32:44.08,00:32:44.08,me. There's nothing good about it.
577,00:32:52.00,00:32:52.00,>> AMI: There we go. You want me to go get more

581,00:33:00.62,00:33:00.62,Why... do we need three people to go?

583,00:33:11.17,00:33:11.17,Lisa said she wanted to know where the manioc was just in

585,00:33:18.12,00:33:18.12,"Kind of like an oops, did that really just come out of your"
586,00:33:20.67,00:33:20.67,"mouth? That's pretty funny, Lisa."
587,00:33:22.88,00:33:22.88,You want to go with me just in case I'm not here for you...
588,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,That's funny. That's what she just said to me.
589,00:33:28.21,00:33:28.21,>> LISA: That's not what I said. I said just in case somebody
590,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,needs to go get it. >> AMI: Right.
591,00:33:34.62,00:33:34.62,I think Lisa is so sneaky. I don't trust her.
592,00:33:38.17,00:33:38.17,I watch. Watching is the best way to
593,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,"figure it out, and I don't really love what I see when I"
594,00:33:44.75,00:33:44.75,watch her. >> LISA: What are you feeling
595,00:33:46.83,00:33:46.83,tonight? >> AMI: I don't feel comfortable
596,00:33:48.46,00:33:48.46,"voting for Rory, no matter what, because I feel like he's really"
597,00:33:51.12,00:33:51.12,"put himself out there. >> LISA: Yeah, I want him to be"
598,00:33:53.79,00:33:53.79,"a part. >> SCOUT: Yeah, absolutely."
599,00:33:58.00,00:33:58.00,">> SCOUT: Which, you know, my vote is going to be for Liza."

605,00:34:14.50,00:34:14.50,Your comment was just rude. >> LISA: About what?
606,00:34:16.42,00:34:16.42,">> AMI: About, ""Oh, I want to go 'cause just in case you're not"

613,00:34:33.00,00:34:33.00,honestly say right now I trust Eliza more than I trust Lisa.
614,00:34:35.71,00:34:35.71,"I'm sorry, but I just do. >> LISA: I want to know why."
615,00:34:39.42,00:34:39.42,>> AMI: Just because Liza has always been straight up with me.
616,00:34:41.71,00:34:41.71,There are just little things that have set me off.

621,00:34:49.75,00:34:49.75,"You know what? I'll be honest, Ami, I haven't"
622,00:34:51.46,00:34:51.46,done one thing to make you not trust me except this comment
623,00:34:53.88,00:34:53.88,which I think is unfair. I think it's unfair.
624,00:34:55.79,00:34:55.79,">> AMI: It's not just... It's little things, honey."
625,00:34:58.08,00:34:58.08,>> SCOUT: Let it go. >> AMI: Like your anger building
626,00:35:00.50,00:35:00.50,"up towards me isn't helping one bit, like, and I can feel it."

633,00:35:17.12,00:35:17.12,>> LISA: I swear to you. I'm here till the end. Swear.
634,00:35:20.71,00:35:20.71,You know what? I don't need a person I don't
635,00:35:23.21,00:35:23.21,"know not trusting me. I mean, you know what?"
636,00:35:25.42,00:35:25.42,For me to sit there and act like I'm swearing on the Bible.
637,00:35:28.58,00:35:28.58,"You know, I'm not doing that anymore either."
638,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,I refuse to do that again. I'm not going to swear to my God
639,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,to please these people who can't trust me.
640,00:35:36.83,00:35:36.83,I'm not going to do it anymore. I'm not going to kiss Ami's butt
641,00:35:40.42,00:35:40.42,to stay in this game. I wish her butt was out of here
642,00:35:43.25,00:35:43.25,"right now, to tell you the truth, because I'm so mad."

645,00:35:54.46,00:35:54.46,"Eliza left, quite frankly. I'd rather you figure out how to"
646,00:35:58.25,00:35:58.25,get those ladies to change their opinion.
647,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,">> SCOUT: Well, if I could get Lisa to go sit down with Ami"
648,00:36:03.04,00:36:03.04,"but, um, she won't do it, and there's a tiff between the two"

653,00:36:19.38,00:36:19.38,just so ecstatic. I could care less who I vote
654,00:36:21.88,00:36:21.88,for. All I want is for someone to
655,00:36:23.58,00:36:23.58,"leave the island other than me. You know, I'm just happy to be"
656,00:36:26.83,00:36:26.83,"here. >> AMI: Oh, yeah, I'm happy..."
657,00:36:28.54,00:36:28.54,Do you know how happy I am that you're here?
658,00:36:33.00,00:36:33.00,>> RORY: I am so happy. >> AMI: What?
659,00:36:34.75,00:36:34.75,>> RORY: I am just happy right now.

667,00:37:00.17,00:37:00.17,a fissure and nobody gave me any odds to break this alliance of
668,00:37:05.54,00:37:05.54,"women, and I have broken it. >> JEFF: Welcome back to Tribal"
669,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"Council. Scout, since you re-divided into"
