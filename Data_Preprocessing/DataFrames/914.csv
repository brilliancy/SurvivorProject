356,00:22:50.08,00:22:52.25,with everyone.But I know that Twila is already
357,00:22:52.25,00:22:55.04,"trying to wheel and deal, so Ithink you should get in on that,"
358,00:22:55.04,00:22:59.25,"too, because I would rather seeyou and Chris in the final two."

372,00:23:40.96,00:23:43.04,There's nothing in the gameright now.
373,00:23:43.04,00:23:45.83,It's all about just gettingyourself to the next step.
374,00:23:45.83,00:24:02.58,To hell with everybody else.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in

380,00:24:30.67,00:24:33.58,"as excited as you were today.Eliza, do you remember back to"
381,00:24:33.58,00:24:36.33,"the first challenge, the one guywho couldn't get across the"

391,00:24:55.83,00:24:58.33,"you know, I like him?"">> Well, of course I'm envious,"
392,00:24:58.33,00:25:01.58,"but you know, if I couldn'thave it, Chris would be my"
393,00:25:01.58,00:25:04.58,next choice for the person tohave individual immunity.
394,00:25:04.58,00:25:07.17,"I mean, that's no secret.So, yeah, I'm definitely happy"
395,00:25:07.17,00:25:08.71,for Chris.>> PROBST: And you say it's no
396,00:25:08.71,00:25:10.25,secret.You're referring to the fact

398,00:25:12.25,00:25:14.38,different people.>> Yes.
399,00:25:14.38,00:25:16.79,>> PROBST: And it does seem likethere's a friendship with Chris.
400,00:25:16.79,00:25:19.75,">> Yes, yes, we've definitelygotten really close and, you"
401,00:25:19.75,00:25:23.21,"know, I'm glad that we've gottento know each other and formed as"

408,00:25:40.25,00:25:43.00,"maybe I'm wrong, but this isthe first night since I've been"
409,00:25:43.00,00:25:46.25,"here, I've been at ease.I feel in my heart that I've"
410,00:25:46.25,00:25:49.96,"been at ease, the first night.>> PROBST: Scout, this is where"
411,00:25:49.96,00:25:53.04,"it gets really complicated,because you can't risk telling"
412,00:25:53.04,00:25:56.38,"anybody the truth anyway,because there's too much time to"
413,00:25:56.38,00:25:59.29,"maneuver out from under you ifyou do tell them, so everybody"
414,00:25:59.29,00:26:01.67,has to keep a secret.Somebody here is gonna be
415,00:26:01.67,00:26:04.42,"surprised, and yet, Scout, youdon't seem too worried."
416,00:26:04.42,00:26:07.25,">> It would surprise me.It could be me tonight, though,"
417,00:26:07.25,00:26:11.62,"and if it does, I'll go... andget up and get my torch and"
418,00:26:11.62,00:26:13.42,"walk out.>> PROBST: Chris, you're a"
419,00:26:13.42,00:26:16.08,little bit in the driver's seatbecause you seem to have
420,00:26:16.08,00:26:18.29,relationships with all threeof these women.
421,00:26:18.29,00:26:21.25,>> Absolutely I have arelationship with all three of

423,00:26:24.04,00:26:26.79,playing the game.No matter if I've developed a
424,00:26:26.79,00:26:30.46,friendship with somebody.Friendship... game.
425,00:26:30.46,00:26:32.96,Friendship right there.I'm gonna have to put it back
426,00:26:32.96,00:26:34.50,here tonight.It's time to play the game.
427,00:26:34.50,00:26:37.92,">> PROBST: Twila, been days outhere where you went to bed and"
428,00:26:37.92,00:26:40.96,"thought, ""Okay, I was maybe alittle rough today."""
429,00:26:40.96,00:26:43.92,">> Most definitely, yeah.There's, there's a couple of"
430,00:26:43.92,00:26:46.92,major mistakes that I've madeout here and I feel pretty
431,00:26:46.92,00:26:49.04,bad about.The main thing that comes to
432,00:26:49.04,00:26:52.29,"mind is swearing on my son'sname, and I'm very ashamed of"
433,00:26:52.29,00:26:55.71,"that, but I can't take it back.>> PROBST: What do you think his"
434,00:26:55.71,00:26:58.29,"take, James, will be on that?>> If I win a million dollars,"
435,00:26:58.29,00:27:01.08,"he'll say, ""Hell, yes, Mom,you can swear on my name any"
436,00:27:01.08,00:27:03.75,"time you want.""But I just shouldn't have done"
437,00:27:03.75,00:27:05.42,it.That's the bottom line.
438,00:27:05.42,00:27:08.75,I should have never have broughthis name into it.
439,00:27:08.75,00:27:12.96,"I should have never done it.>> PROBST: All right, Chris."
440,00:27:12.96,00:27:15.04,"You have immunity.At this point in the game, I"
441,00:27:15.04,00:27:18.08,"think you'd be a fool to give itup probably, but you never know"
442,00:27:18.08,00:27:21.04,what somebody's strategy is.>> I am not a fool.
443,00:27:21.04,00:27:24.12,"I'm not giving up immunity.>> PROBST: Okay, you cannot vote"
444,00:27:24.12,00:27:26.79,"for Chris.Eliza, Scout, Twila-- one of you"
445,00:27:26.79,00:27:29.21,is about to go home.Let's find out who that's gonna

447,00:27:30.67,00:27:42.54,"Eliza, you're up.>> Twila, I am voting for you"
448,00:27:42.54,00:27:45.58,for the third time this game.You're like the cockroach that
449,00:27:45.58,00:27:47.17,won't die under therefrigerator.
450,00:27:47.17,00:27:49.112,"Hopefully, you're going hometonight."
451,00:27:56.04,00:27:58.33,>> You have drove mecrazy from day one.
452,00:27:58.33,00:28:01.12,"If you go home tonight, it'sgonna be the happiest night"
453,00:28:01.12,00:28:04.21,since I've been here.You've got a lot of growing up
454,00:28:04.21,00:28:19.25,to do.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
455,00:28:19.25,00:28:33.25,"votes.Once the votes are read, the"
456,00:28:33.25,00:28:35.04,decision is final.The person voted out will be
457,00:28:35.04,00:28:36.96,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
458,00:28:36.96,00:28:44.38,I'll read the votes.The first vote-- Eliza.
459,00:28:48.62,00:28:52.92,"Twila.One vote Eliza, one vote Twila."
460,00:28:55.04,00:28:59.54,"Liza.Two votes Eliza, one vote Twila."

464,00:29:37.62,00:29:41.08,point in the game: final three.Tomorrow you'll take part in the
465,00:29:41.08,00:29:44.58,last immunity challenge.The winner guaranteed a spot in
466,00:29:44.58,00:29:48.25,the final two and gets to decidewho sits next to them at the
467,00:29:48.25,00:29:51.08,final Tribal Council.Get a good night's sleep.
468,00:29:51.08,00:29:53.42,Grab your torches and head backto camp.
469,00:29:53.42,00:29:59.54,Good night.>> I'm definitely disappointed
470,00:29:59.54,00:30:02.17,that Chris voted for me.I was shocked that he wrote my
471,00:30:02.17,00:30:04.75,"name down when he said he wasn'tgoing to and he, you know, gave"
472,00:30:04.75,00:30:06.75,"me his word, the whole pact.It turns out I did not have a"
473,00:30:06.75,00:30:11.83,"single ally this entire game.I look for the best in people,"
474,00:30:11.83,00:30:15.21,"and it's definitely going tochange my outlook and, yeah,"
475,00:30:15.21,00:30:28.62,"that hurts.>> Chris, did you see"
476,00:30:28.62,00:30:30.62,that look Eliza gave you?If looks was to kill...
477,00:30:30.62,00:30:32.04,">> I mean, I don't knowwhat her problem is."
478,00:30:32.04,00:30:34.17,I just stick with my alliance.That's all I do.
479,00:30:34.17,00:30:36.04,I ain't like her.See you later.
480,00:30:36.04,00:30:38.17,">> You know what?There is a merciful God,"
481,00:30:38.17,00:30:39.67,you guys.Liza is not going to be running
482,00:30:39.67,00:30:43.33,her mouth.This night is beautiful because
483,00:30:43.33,00:30:51.17,it's quiet.There is no Eliza noises in
484,00:30:51.17,00:30:53.96,camp.It was kind of like getting
485,00:30:53.96,00:30:56.71,"a thorn out of your foot ora thorn out of your side,"
486,00:30:56.71,00:30:58.25,you know?She just drove me nuts for so
487,00:30:58.25,00:31:00.54,long.>> Look up in the sky and
488,00:31:00.54,00:31:04.08,look how many stars there are.>> It's gorgeous.
489,00:31:04.08,00:31:07.08,">> I never dreamed I'd beplaying the game the way I am,"
490,00:31:07.08,00:31:10.29,"lying, deceiving.You ain't got no choice because"
491,00:31:10.29,00:31:13.04,I tell you what.If you don't step it up and
492,00:31:13.04,00:31:16.58,"you don't start playing the gamein your best interest, to"
493,00:31:16.58,00:31:21.12,"benefit and go to the end,you'll be sent packing."
494,00:31:21.12,00:31:26.25,"And, uh, going back home with amillion bucks..."
495,00:31:26.25,00:31:42.08,"that'll change your life.>> Hey, Chris, here comes Jeff."
496,00:31:42.08,00:31:45.17,"Jeff, I was gonna meet you, butthey don't want to stumble over"
497,00:31:45.17,00:31:46.88,the rocks.>> PROBST: That's all right.
498,00:31:46.88,00:31:50.71,"I'll come to you.Well, it's day 38."
499,00:31:50.71,00:31:52.62,>> Yeah.>> Whoo.
500,00:31:52.62,00:31:54.88,>> PROBST: It's time for yourfinal rite of passage.
501,00:31:54.88,00:31:57.62,I know you remember the story Itold you recently about Roy
502,00:31:57.62,00:32:01.71,"Mata, a very famous chief whowas poisoned to death by his"
503,00:32:01.71,00:32:04.42,brother and then buried alongwith all of his chiefs and
504,00:32:04.42,00:32:06.33,"their wives.Many of them were buried alive,"
505,00:32:06.33,00:32:09.25,and they were buried on anisland that was then considered
506,00:32:09.25,00:32:13.88,"so taboo after that burial, thatnobody visited for 700 years."
507,00:32:13.88,00:32:17.12,"You may have figured it out.If you haven't, you've been"
508,00:32:17.12,00:32:19.79,"sitting across it for 38 days.>> See, I figured that out."
509,00:32:19.79,00:32:23.83,">> That's the island, no way.>> PROBST: Aratoca Island, also"
510,00:32:23.83,00:32:25.88,known as Hat Island for theshape of it.
511,00:32:25.88,00:32:29.62,"That island is the most sacredspot in Vanuatu, so it is a"
512,00:32:29.62,00:32:33.04,fitting spot for your final riteof passage.
513,00:32:33.04,00:32:37.04,You're gonna paddle over.You'll find 15 torches of the
514,00:32:37.04,00:32:39.29,survivors who are no longer inthis game.
515,00:32:39.29,00:32:42.71,Take a moment at each one ofthem to reflect on what impact
516,00:32:42.71,00:32:45.46,"they had on the game, whatimpact they've have had on you,"
517,00:32:45.46,00:32:48.12,if any.You will then go to the actual
518,00:32:48.12,00:32:51.79,"burial site of Roy Mata, make anoffering."
519,00:32:51.79,00:32:55.83,"This is a gesture of thanks toVanuatu for our time out here,"
520,00:32:55.83,00:32:59.96,so bring something of value toleave at this gravesite.
521,00:32:59.96,00:33:02.21,"When you're finished, I'll meetyou on the other side for your"
522,00:33:02.21,00:33:03.88,final immunity challenge.Enjoy this time.
523,00:33:03.88,00:33:06.75,I'll see you over there.>> Thanks.
524,00:33:06.75,00:33:10.12,"Being in the final three isamazing to me, but I don't know"
525,00:33:10.12,00:33:13.67,what's going to happen.It's going to be a happy day and
526,00:33:13.67,00:33:25.88,"a sad day all up in one.>> At this pace, we ought to"
527,00:33:25.88,00:33:29.67,get there about noon tomorrow.>> We're making progress.
528,00:33:55.58,00:34:00.42,"Brook, he was our first.Really never really had much of"
529,00:34:00.42,00:34:02.25,a chance.>> Yeah.
530,00:34:02.25,00:34:04.42,>> It was a crazy three days.You've got to out-will the
531,00:34:04.42,00:34:07.04,"environment, you got to outplaythe other people."
532,00:34:07.04,00:34:10.17,"You get caught in one bad day,one bad situation, snip,"
533,00:34:10.17,00:34:13.12,you're gone.And that's what happened to me.
534,00:34:13.12,00:34:17.58,>> Dolly was a very personableyoung woman and had the most
535,00:34:17.58,00:34:21.25,beautiful eyes I've ever seen.>> My experience out here
536,00:34:21.25,00:34:27.17,"was short but excellent, um, alittle confusing because I found"
537,00:34:27.17,00:34:30.67,"myself caught in the middle, andI wasn't able to make up my mind"
538,00:34:30.67,00:34:37.75,"quick enough, and it backfired.>> This whole experience is"
539,00:34:37.75,00:34:41.29,really going to change the way Ilook at things from here on out.
540,00:34:41.29,00:34:44.58,"I'm going to appreciate thosearound me more-- emotionally,"
541,00:34:44.58,00:34:48.25,spiritually.I'm going to appreciate fire.
542,00:34:52.04,00:34:54.29,>> I'm usually pretty goodat getting along with almost
543,00:34:54.29,00:34:57.79,"anybody, but, again, I'mItalian, I couldn't control"
544,00:34:57.79,00:35:00.79,the temper and I clashedwith a lot of people.
545,00:35:00.79,00:35:05.12,Ultimately it got me voted outof the game.
546,00:35:05.12,00:35:08.96,>> I don't know that I could'vedone anything differently after
547,00:35:08.96,00:35:12.29,the first hour of the game.Things were polarized so
548,00:35:12.29,00:35:14.58,quickly.I probably shouldn't have
549,00:35:14.58,00:35:16.42,climbed that damn pole onthe first day.
550,00:35:16.42,00:35:18.12,"Maybe that would have helped, Idon't know."

744,00:50:43.04,00:50:45.67,>> Very long day.>> PROBST: And then you had your
745,00:50:45.67,00:50:49.25,"final immunity challenge withobviously a lot at stake, so"
746,00:50:49.25,00:50:52.12,"let's go through that.Chris, the minute Scout goes"
747,00:50:52.12,00:50:55.12,"down, you start talking, ""Let'smake a deal."""
748,00:50:55.12,00:50:57.25,>> Yeah.>> PROBST: Only the deal you
749,00:50:57.25,00:50:58.88,wanted to make was for Twila tostep down.
750,00:50:58.88,00:51:01.12,">> It was the perfect deal forme, you know."
751,00:51:01.12,00:51:03.92,"If she steps down, then youknow, we both get to rest, but"
752,00:51:03.92,00:51:08.46,Twila is very thick-skinned anddoesn't give up and she fights
753,00:51:08.46,00:51:11.71,"to the end, and when Scout said,""Hang in there,"" I didn't think"
754,00:51:11.71,00:51:15.08,"we were so good after Scout saidthat, so I wasn't about to step"
755,00:51:15.08,00:51:18.92,"down, and I don't blame her fornot stepping down."
756,00:51:18.92,00:51:21.46,">> PROBST: So, this afternoon,you're a popular guy."
757,00:51:21.46,00:51:24.04,"You've got immunity, not abetter spot to be tonight than"
758,00:51:24.04,00:51:26.71,the one you're sitting in.Did you get approached?
759,00:51:26.71,00:51:29.88,">> Um, actually, no, Idid not get approached."
760,00:51:29.88,00:51:34.25,We went back to camp and theyboth understood that I was... I
761,00:51:34.25,00:51:36.08,"was holding the deck of cardsand, you know, I was the only"
762,00:51:36.08,00:51:39.58,"one that was going to play and,you know, I've still got a"
763,00:51:39.58,00:51:42.04,"decision to make, so...>> I just feel extremely"
764,00:51:42.04,00:51:44.88,good about both of these people.There can't be a bad outcome in
765,00:51:44.88,00:51:47.33,this game.They are just amazing people.
766,00:51:47.33,00:51:51.38,">> PROBST: Twila, could there bea bad outcome for you tonight?"
767,00:51:51.38,00:51:55.00,>> Most definitely.I played the game hard.
768,00:51:55.00,00:51:59.08,I've wanted to win from day one.I've done everything I can to
769,00:51:59.08,00:52:03.12,"get where I'm at now, and Idon't want to settle for third."
770,00:52:03.12,00:52:06.46,">> PROBST: Chris, when you hearthe two different sides-- Scout"
771,00:52:06.46,00:52:10.21,"on one hand saying ""I'm happy,it's fine."""
772,00:52:10.21,00:52:13.12,"Twila saying ""I am not done""--that obviously has to factor in"
773,00:52:13.12,00:52:17.42,"a little bit to you, becauseyou're making a $900,000"
774,00:52:17.42,00:52:21.71,"decision tonight.>> Well, I listen to that"
775,00:52:21.71,00:52:24.83,and I respect the way Scout gotto this point in the game.
776,00:52:24.83,00:52:29.46,"You know, Scout mentally playedthe game strong, and Scout was"
777,00:52:29.46,00:52:32.42,"willing to change the game, notonly for her benefit, but for"
778,00:52:32.42,00:52:35.25,"other people's benefit, and Ilook at that and then I look at"
779,00:52:35.25,00:52:38.75,"Twila, and I see how aggressiveTwila was in playing the game."
780,00:52:38.75,00:52:41.21,She did what she had to do toget to the final three-- whether
781,00:52:41.21,00:52:45.62,"it be lie, tell the truth, beloyal, break an alliance, it"
782,00:52:45.62,00:52:48.17,didn't matter-- and she admitsthat.
783,00:52:48.17,00:52:50.96,But I'm not going to look at howthey played the game.
784,00:52:50.96,00:52:55.12,I'm looking at how I played thegame and I've got to finish.
785,00:52:55.12,00:52:57.08,>> PROBST: Then let's getto the vote.
786,00:52:57.08,00:52:59.46,"You cannot vote for Chris.That means, Twila, you can only"
787,00:52:59.46,00:53:02.04,"vote for Scout; Scout, youcan only vote for Twila."
788,00:53:02.04,00:53:04.04,Your votes cancel each otherout.
789,00:53:04.04,00:53:06.83,"You won't vote.Chris, you'll cast the only vote"
790,00:53:06.83,00:53:09.33,and you will do two thingssimultaneously.
791,00:53:09.33,00:53:11.83,"You will vote out the 16thperson from this game, and you"
792,00:53:11.83,00:53:15.25,will decide who's gonna sit nextto you at the final Tribal
793,00:53:15.25,00:53:16.88,Council.You will in effect choose your
794,00:53:16.88,00:53:20.04,opponent.It is your vote.
795,00:53:20.04,00:53:50.121,Go make it.I'll go get the vote.
796,00:54:03.38,00:54:05.42,"Once the vote is read, thedecision is final."
797,00:54:05.42,00:54:07.25,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
798,00:54:07.25,00:54:10.42,Council area immediately.I'll read the vote.
799,00:54:12.08,00:54:16.62,The 16th person voted out ofSurvivor: Vanuatu...
800,00:54:20.67,00:54:24.67,Scout.You need to bring me your torch.
801,00:54:35.00,00:54:51.46,"Scout, the tribe has spoken.You've gone as far as you can go"
802,00:54:51.46,00:54:55.17,in this game on your own.The power now shifts to these
803,00:54:55.17,00:54:58.79,"six jury members and Scout, whobecomes tonight our seventh jury"
804,00:54:58.79,00:55:01.92,"member, now hold your fate intheir hands."
805,00:55:01.92,00:55:06.21,We will reconvene for one finalTribal Council tomorrow night.
806,00:55:06.21,00:55:09.17,"In the meantime, you have onenight left."
807,00:55:09.17,00:55:11.12,Enjoy it.You've earned it.
808,00:55:11.12,00:55:12.71,Grab your torches.Head back to camp.
809,00:55:12.71,00:55:17.08,Good night.>> I feel really good
810,00:55:17.08,00:55:20.08,about how I played the game.I maintained the loyalty and
811,00:55:20.08,00:55:24.21,integrity as long as loyalty wasthere to embrace and when it
812,00:55:24.21,00:55:27.29,"wasn't, I embraced anotheralliance and was able to turn"
813,00:55:27.29,00:55:30.88,"the game around, make it a wholelot more exciting and fun, and I"
814,00:55:30.88,00:55:34.17,feel really good to have gottenthis far and wish Chris and
815,00:55:34.17,00:56:05.21,Twila the very best.>> This is the last pot
816,00:56:05.21,00:56:08.29,of manioc I'll ever make.This is probably the last time
817,00:56:08.29,00:56:11.17,I'll ever eat manioc.>> With any hope.
818,00:56:11.17,00:56:16.67,This is day 39. This is it.I made it.
819,00:56:16.67,00:56:21.00,I turned things around in myfavor and it paid off.
820,00:56:32.33,00:56:35.21,>> I am definitely feelingstress on a day that I
821,00:56:35.21,00:56:38.71,never imagined I would feelstress.
822,00:56:38.71,00:56:42.17,"I was ready to get up today andenjoy the entire day, and I"
823,00:56:42.17,00:56:45.17,"found myself thinking, ""I've gotto keep playing the game."""
824,00:56:45.17,00:56:47.33,I've been thinking about Tribaltonight.
825,00:56:47.33,00:56:49.33,>> Yeah.>> I ain't gonna take no crap
826,00:56:49.33,00:56:51.58,"from any of them, are you?>> I'm going to try not to."
827,00:56:51.58,00:56:54.12,">> I mean, they're not going torun me in the ground because"
828,00:56:54.12,00:56:56.83,"I lasted longer than them.And I mean, I just know"
829,00:56:56.83,00:56:59.79,"how you are.Twila is extremely outspoken,"
830,00:56:59.79,00:57:02.54,and I can use that to myadvantage tonight.
831,00:57:02.54,00:57:06.62,"I mean, I want them to rememberexactly how Twila was: just a"
832,00:57:06.62,00:57:09.75,"cutthroat, didn't-take-no-crapkind of player."
833,00:57:09.75,00:57:13.29,I just think about some of thepeople on the jury taking their
834,00:57:13.29,00:57:14.67,disappointment out on us.>> They will.
835,00:57:14.67,00:57:18.00,>> I really don't know ifI'm inclined to sit there and
836,00:57:18.00,00:57:20.04,"let them do that.I mean, I'll just sit and think,"
837,00:57:20.04,00:57:22.54,"""Well, I know Twila ain't gonnatake no crap, so I'm not gonna"

839,00:57:25.25,00:57:27.88,">> Great, Twila, you let themknow you don't give a crap"
840,00:57:27.88,00:57:31.42,and that you come here to win.Chris isn't gonna do that.
841,00:57:31.42,00:57:34.25,Chris is gonna sit back and letTwila put the last nail in her
842,00:57:34.25,00:57:50.71,coffin.>> I'm a little apprehensive
843,00:57:50.71,00:57:54.21,about tonight.I honestly feel like I deserve
844,00:57:54.21,00:57:57.62,a million because I did play thethe game the best.
845,00:57:57.62,00:58:00.12,I didn't suck up to anybody.I didn't pretend to be something
846,00:58:00.12,00:58:03.79,that I wasn't.Don't hold it against me because
847,00:58:03.79,00:58:07.67,I outwitted and outplayed you.I deserve their votes just as
848,00:58:07.67,00:58:11.21,much as Chris.>> I think I'm ready.
849,00:58:11.21,00:58:15.71,>> Back to reality reality.>> That's right.
850,00:58:15.71,00:58:17.83,"It's over with after tonight,okay?"
851,00:58:17.83,00:58:21.42,>> Yeah.>> No way is this party
852,00:58:21.42,00:58:27.08,coming to an end.>> Whoo.
853,00:58:27.08,00:58:31.33,"(Chris grunts, Twila laughs)>> What an ending."
854,00:58:31.33,00:58:34.46,>> (laughing): I haven'tlaughed that hard since
855,00:58:34.46,00:58:37.83,"I been here, I don't think.>> The closer Tribal Council"

857,00:58:41.42,00:58:43.08,"You know, in the backof my head, I just keep thinking"

861,00:58:51.58,00:58:53.83,"this game.""And just out of spite, they can"
862,00:58:53.83,00:58:58.08,vote for Twila.>> Isn't it funny how I'm
863,00:58:58.08,00:58:59.88,actually going to probably missthis place?

913,01:03:06.00,01:03:09.21,"loyal to the alliances that Imade throughout the game, I"
914,01:03:09.21,01:03:12.58,think I'm the person thatovercome more odds than anybody.
915,01:03:12.58,01:03:15.21,I was the last man standing withsix women.
916,01:03:15.21,01:03:18.12,I just think I deserve to winthis game because of the odds I
917,01:03:18.12,01:03:24.08,overcome.That's all.
918,01:03:24.08,01:03:28.71,>> PROBST: Twila.>> I came to this game with
919,01:03:28.71,01:03:33.88,"one goal, and that goal was towin a million dollars to better"
920,01:03:33.88,01:03:38.04,"my life and my son's.I played the game to win, I"
921,01:03:38.04,01:03:41.42,played it hard.I know I didn't do everything
922,01:03:41.42,01:03:44.25,that I should have done andshould have done more in some
923,01:03:44.25,01:03:46.25,"other incidents, but it camefrom my soul."
924,01:03:46.25,01:03:50.08,"Everything I did was to win thismillion dollars, and that's why"
925,01:03:50.08,01:03:53.29,I believe I should be the solesurvivor tonight.
926,01:03:53.29,01:03:57.21,I believe I've earned it.I worked hard for it.
927,01:03:57.21,01:03:59.50,That's all.>> PROBST: All right.
928,01:03:59.50,01:04:02.08,"Jury, in a moment, you're goingto get your first opportunity to"
929,01:04:02.08,01:04:06.25,address Chris and Twila sinceyou were voted out of the game.
930,01:04:06.25,01:04:09.04,Give you a minute to think aboutwhat you want to say.
931,01:04:32.12,01:04:36.25,">> PROBST: All right.Jury, it is now your chance to"
932,01:04:36.25,01:04:40.08,address Chris and Twila for thefirst time since you've been
933,01:04:40.08,01:04:43.117,"voted out of the game.Eliza, you're up."
934,01:04:47.50,01:04:50.21,">> Um, before I addressmy question to you, I have a"
935,01:04:50.21,01:04:52.67,"couple of comments.Twila, I'll start with you."
936,01:04:52.67,01:04:56.04,Congratulations.You achieved what you set
937,01:04:56.04,01:04:58.17,"out to do.You came into this game, saying"
938,01:04:58.17,01:05:01.17,"you would do whatever it took toget to the final two, and that"
939,01:05:01.17,01:05:04.79,"you did.You were a deceptive, lying"
940,01:05:04.79,01:05:09.12,bitch throughout this game.You never treated me with an
941,01:05:09.12,01:05:11.88,ounce of respect.You didn't even speak to me like
942,01:05:11.88,01:05:14.42,I deserved your breath.I might envy your position in
943,01:05:14.42,01:05:17.17,"the final two, but I do not envyyour life."
944,01:05:17.17,01:05:22.12,"Now, with that being said, I dothink you played a good game,"
945,01:05:22.12,01:05:27.29,"and you were outright about it.Chris, you, on the other hand,"
946,01:05:27.29,01:05:29.50,you shocked me.You shocked me.
947,01:05:29.50,01:05:33.33,"Whereas I knew Twila was goingto be a deceptive, lying bitch,"
948,01:05:33.33,01:05:39.42,"I did not know that you were adeceptive lying bitch, too."
949,01:05:39.42,01:05:42.21,"You pretended to be my friend.I mean, you stabbed me in the"
950,01:05:42.21,01:05:44.62,back with the Julie thing andthen you stabbed me in the back
951,01:05:44.62,01:05:49.08,"again and rubbed salt in thewound-- unnecessary, blatant"
952,01:05:49.08,01:05:52.04,lies!My request tonight from the two
953,01:05:52.04,01:05:54.50,"of you is, I would like anapology."
954,01:05:54.50,01:05:59.83,"Twila, you first.>> Eliza, I never talked to"
955,01:05:59.83,01:06:02.67,you with any disrespect whenyou respected me.
956,01:06:02.67,01:06:06.50,I never said any bad words toyou until the latter part of
957,01:06:06.50,01:06:09.17,"this week, not at all.>> You're right."
958,01:06:09.17,01:06:11.04,You just said mean andhateful and spiteful things
959,01:06:11.04,01:06:13.29,"behind my back.>> All I said was, you talk"
960,01:06:13.29,01:06:15.46,"too damn much, and you do.>> That's a lie."
961,01:06:15.46,01:06:17.71,">> What else was I supposedto have said, Eliza?"
962,01:06:17.71,01:06:20.46,">> What? Oh, my God.Should I start listing things?"
963,01:06:20.46,01:06:23.12,>> I'd like to know.>> You said that I didn't
964,01:06:23.12,01:06:25.33,"deserve to be here, I was aspoiled brat, um, that I..."
965,01:06:25.33,01:06:27.79,>> But did I not tell youthat to your face?
966,01:06:27.79,01:06:30.50,"And I did tell you how I felt.>> Is this, is this an apology?"
967,01:06:30.50,01:06:32.96,"I mean, if you don't feel that Ideserve an apology, then fine,"
968,01:06:32.96,01:06:34.71,fine.>> I'm just getting to the
969,01:06:34.71,01:06:36.92,"point.You feel that I'm a lying,"
970,01:06:36.92,01:06:40.75,"deceptive bitch, well, I thinkyou're a spoiled, rotten"
971,01:06:40.75,01:06:43.21,little child.And if you don't owe me an
972,01:06:43.21,01:06:46.38,"apology for how you feel aboutme, why should I apologize to"
973,01:06:46.38,01:06:48.88,you for the way you feel aboutme?
974,01:06:48.88,01:06:52.17,>> Okay.>> And I just don't feel like I
975,01:06:52.17,01:06:55.88,"owe you an apology, no, I don't.>> Okay. Chris?"
976,01:06:55.88,01:06:58.58,">> Eliza, when I made that pactwith you standing there, I"
977,01:06:58.58,01:07:02.54,"didn't intend to do you wrong.I did it as strategy, and you're"
978,01:07:02.54,01:07:07.25,"right, I owe you an apology.I broke our pact and I am sorry."
979,01:07:07.25,01:07:11.83,">> Thank you.>> PROBST: Thanks, Eliza."
980,01:07:12.88,01:07:17.00,Julie.(Julie sniffles and sighs)
981,01:07:24.46,01:07:26.79,>> I thought I'd at least getone sentence out before I
982,01:07:26.79,01:07:29.92,"started to cry, but I'mfeeling abnormally emotional"
983,01:07:29.92,01:07:33.04,"tonight, so...(sighs heavily)"
984,01:07:33.04,01:07:39.67,"Um, Twila, I saw all yourtactics, antics and, I mean, I"
985,01:07:39.67,01:07:42.12,"tried to get you out of thegame, like what, five, six"
986,01:07:42.12,01:07:44.88,times...My energy is directed towards
987,01:07:44.88,01:07:46.54,Chris tonight...>> Okay.
988,01:07:46.54,01:07:48.96,>> ...in the fact that I'meither voting for Chris or
989,01:07:48.96,01:07:51.62,"against Chris.So, I just want to let you know."
990,01:07:51.62,01:07:55.04,">> That's fine.>> (sniffling): Christopher,"
991,01:07:55.04,01:08:00.04,"um, you approached me as afriend and asked for help"
992,01:08:00.04,01:08:04.08,with everything to lose.I helped you as a friend with
993,01:08:04.08,01:08:09.83,"nothing to gain for myself, andyou were the one person who I"
994,01:08:09.83,01:08:14.38,gave the opportunity to hurtmy feelings.
995,01:08:14.38,01:08:16.83,Surprise.I'm here crying.
996,01:08:16.83,01:08:20.88,"Um, so I have two questionsfor you."
997,01:08:20.88,01:08:24.88,"First off, there are severaloccasions where I described our"
998,01:08:24.88,01:08:29.71,"relationship, brother-sister,and I don't understand why you"
999,01:08:29.71,01:08:35.50,"had to doll it up that much,to look me so solidly in the"
1000,01:08:35.50,01:08:38.88,eyes and base things on ourfriendship and on things that I
1001,01:08:38.88,01:08:44.29,"felt were real.So, that's my first question."
1002,01:08:44.29,01:08:51.42,">> Julie, you are absolutely thehardest decision I made."
1003,01:08:51.42,01:08:55.38,">> Okay, great, like fabulous,but why the story?"
1004,01:08:55.38,01:08:58.58,It was so elaborate.>> Because at the time I
1005,01:08:58.58,01:09:02.42,"had no intentions of writingyour name down; at the time,"
1006,01:09:02.42,01:09:07.21,my intentions were for me andyou to stick together.
1007,01:09:07.21,01:09:11.00,"You looked out for me, you know,and I felt like it was my turn"
1008,01:09:11.00,01:09:13.33,to look out for you.>> It was.
1009,01:09:13.33,01:09:17.04,">> I lied to you, Julie, and,I mean, I can't take it back."
1010,01:09:17.04,01:09:20.21,>> Okay.Second question: When did you
1011,01:09:20.21,01:09:22.58,"start playing me?And I want the truth, because"
1012,01:09:22.58,01:09:24.38,this is it.I'm not set on who I'm
1013,01:09:24.38,01:09:26.83,"voting for.I'm pissed off at you, so tell"
1014,01:09:26.83,01:09:32.12,"me, what was authentic about ourrelationship and you?"
1015,01:09:32.12,01:09:36.17,">> I didn't play you, Julie.I lied to you and I let my heart"
1016,01:09:36.17,01:09:40.00,"get in the way, and at the end,I didn't even know if I was"
1017,01:09:40.00,01:09:45.04,"going to write your name downand decided at the booth, I"
1018,01:09:45.04,01:09:47.25,"just... I played the game.I did you wrong, Julie, and I'm"
1019,01:09:47.25,01:09:52.21,sorry I lied to you.If you disregard anything to do
1020,01:09:52.21,01:09:57.21,"with me, I understand, but Itruly looked at you as a little"
1021,01:09:57.21,01:10:01.04,sister and...>> That's enough.
1022,01:10:01.04,01:10:04.54,That's okay.>> I'm sorry.
1023,01:10:04.54,01:10:06.54,">> Thank you.>> PROBST: Thanks, Julie."
1024,01:10:06.54,01:10:11.42,"(Julie sniffling)>> PROBST: Leann, you're next."
1025,01:10:15.33,01:10:17.96,>> Twila.>> Yes.
1026,01:10:17.96,01:10:22.46,>> One of the turning points inthe game particularly for me was
1027,01:10:22.46,01:10:26.88,when you decided to turn yourback on a four-person alliance
1028,01:10:26.88,01:10:31.21,"and vote me out, and on the dayyou decided to do that, you"
1029,01:10:31.21,01:10:35.54,"reinforced your loyalty tome, this time using the words,"
1030,01:10:35.54,01:10:39.83,"""I swear to you on my son's lifethat you have my word."""
1031,01:10:39.83,01:10:42.50,Could you explain to me yourthought process in betraying my
1032,01:10:42.50,01:10:47.08,"trust in our alliance, and why Ishould reward you for it with"
1033,01:10:47.08,01:10:51.00,a million dollars?>> I felt that it was supposed
1034,01:10:51.00,01:10:53.29,"to be Leann, Ami, Scout andmyself."
1035,01:10:53.29,01:10:58.21,I felt when you all turned yourback on Scout and brought Julie
1036,01:10:58.21,01:11:02.29,"into the alliance, I felt thatyou could easily have turned"
1037,01:11:02.29,01:11:05.29,your back on me at any time.>> Even though I never
1038,01:11:05.29,01:11:08.21,did anything to... to makeyou doubt my trust?
1039,01:11:08.21,01:11:10.62,>> I didn't trust you allanymore after you brought Julie
1040,01:11:10.62,01:11:13.21,"in, I did not.I am sorry for that,"
1041,01:11:13.21,01:11:16.92,"because I did trust you.Ami, I never fully trust full"
1042,01:11:16.92,01:11:18.92,"wholeheartedly, but I didtrust you."
1043,01:11:18.92,01:11:22.21,"But when you brought Julie intoit, I felt like, you know,"
1044,01:11:22.21,01:11:25.21,it's gonna be you three and I'mthe one that's going to be
1045,01:11:25.21,01:11:26.88,"sitting on the outside, and Icouldn't do it."
1046,01:11:26.88,01:11:29.62,So I had to change the strategyand that's why I did what I did
1047,01:11:29.62,01:11:32.54,"in the end, not out ofdisrespect for you."
1048,01:11:32.54,01:11:35.67,>> Fair enough.Chris.
1049,01:11:35.67,01:11:40.17,"It's no secret that from dayone, I was pretty much hard-core"
1050,01:11:40.17,01:11:44.75,"with the women's alliance, andmy intention was to see that"
1051,01:11:44.75,01:11:47.38,"through to the end, no matterwhat."
1052,01:11:47.38,01:11:51.29,Convince me to abandon that wayof thinking and vote for you
1053,01:11:51.29,01:11:55.08,"tonight.>> When we merged, I knew"
1054,01:11:55.08,01:11:58.08,"without a doubt, you know, mywork was cut out for me."
1055,01:11:58.08,01:12:02.54,"If I wanted to stay in this gameany longer, then I had to look"
1056,01:12:02.54,01:12:05.38,for an opening and a backdooropened by who else?
1057,01:12:05.38,01:12:10.21,Twila come to me and offered mea chance to further myself in
1058,01:12:10.21,01:12:14.54,"the game, and I took advantage,you know, when the opportunity"
1059,01:12:14.54,01:12:17.17,"came.I just feel like I persevered,"
1060,01:12:17.17,01:12:20.21,"and I think that is the reasonwhy, you know, I think I'm"
1061,01:12:20.21,01:12:24.08,deserving to win the game.>> Thanks.
1062,01:12:24.08,01:12:32.08,">> PROBST: Ami.>> Right now, I just see"
1063,01:12:32.08,01:12:35.25,"some serious irony in that.Twila, even though you had a"
1064,01:12:35.25,01:12:40.62,chance to totally and completelymake an apology that maybe you
1065,01:12:40.62,01:12:44.38,"didn't believe in, for a milliondollars you wouldn't do it, but"
1066,01:12:44.38,01:12:47.12,"you'd lie for a million dollars,you'd break friendships for a"
1067,01:12:47.12,01:12:51.08,"million dollars.You say, um, just didn't really"
1068,01:12:51.08,01:12:53.75,trust Ami.I don't know where that came
1069,01:12:53.75,01:12:57.50,"from, because you had 100% of myloyalty."
1070,01:12:57.50,01:13:01.58,"And, Chris, I'm still justbaffled at why you took the"
1071,01:13:01.58,01:13:06.04,time to flat-out lie to twopeople for no reason.
1072,01:13:06.04,01:13:10.08,"I don't understand it.Chris, I want to know from you"
1073,01:13:10.08,01:13:15.54,first what attributes you thinkyou have that put you in the
1074,01:13:15.54,01:13:18.71,"seat there, and that you think Idon't have putting me standing"
1075,01:13:18.71,01:13:21.04,right here?>> I really don't see me having
1076,01:13:21.04,01:13:24.83,"any qualities any better thanyou when it comes to this game,"
1077,01:13:24.83,01:13:27.79,"I mean, absolutely not.I think that you're on the jury"
1078,01:13:27.79,01:13:30.25,because you have a soft heart.I think you're on the jury
1079,01:13:30.25,01:13:32.04,because I didn't give youa break.
1080,01:13:32.04,01:13:35.62,"You give me a break.You've let your guard down, you"
1081,01:13:35.62,01:13:40.17,"put personal feelings in frontof the game, and, you know, it"
1082,01:13:40.17,01:13:42.50,was your demise.>> Thank you.
1083,01:13:42.50,01:13:45.62,"Twila, same question.>> First of all, I want"
1084,01:13:45.62,01:13:48.38,"to start out, if you don't mind,by apologizing to you and Leann"
1085,01:13:48.38,01:13:52.08,for swearing on my son's name.I should have never brought him
1086,01:13:52.08,01:13:54.12,"into it, I should never havedone that."
1087,01:13:54.12,01:13:57.04,"I thought of the game and Ithought, now, either they're"
1088,01:13:57.04,01:13:59.92,going to respect me for thedecision that I've made to
1089,01:13:59.92,01:14:03.08,"further myself in the game andthat's why I'm here, but now I'm"
1090,01:14:03.08,01:14:05.17,this low-life bitch that nobodylikes and I don't understand
1091,01:14:05.17,01:14:08.67,"that.>> Twila, you flat-out lied"
1092,01:14:08.67,01:14:11.04,to us.You flat-out straight to our
1093,01:14:11.04,01:14:13.21,"face said, ""I'm your friend...>> I did."
1094,01:14:13.21,01:14:14.38,">> ""...I'm going to be heretill the end."""
1095,01:14:14.38,01:14:15.92,That's what you did toboth of us.

1112,01:15:13.17,01:15:16.04,"I'm a little hard and quick tojudge sometimes, and that's not"
1113,01:15:16.04,01:15:21.96,"a good thing.>> Okay. Chris, same question."

1124,01:15:56.21,01:15:59.46,possesses a genuine quality thatthey look past the million
1125,01:15:59.46,01:16:02.96,"dollars, and that's something Ididn't do, that's something I'll"

1171,01:18:37.04,01:18:40.04,(chuckles)I'm not sure where that takes
1172,01:18:40.04,01:18:43.00,you except that it sits youright where you are.
1173,01:18:43.00,01:18:46.25,Thanks for the 38-day ride.It was great.

1177,01:18:56.50,01:18:59.17,"tonight, you know where they'recoming from."
1178,01:18:59.17,01:19:02.67,I'll give you a second to thinkabout your last words to the
1179,01:19:02.67,01:19:25.29,jury.>> PROBST: Okay.

1183,01:19:35.54,01:19:39.62,"change a mind.Twila, you're first."
1184,01:19:42.25,01:19:47.25,>> I didn't come into this gameintentionally wanting to deceive
1185,01:19:47.25,01:19:50.62,or to lie to anyone.I don't do that back home and
1186,01:19:50.62,01:19:53.96,anybody that knows me knows myword is good.
1187,01:19:53.96,01:19:57.00,"Whether you believe that or not,it is good."
1188,01:19:57.00,01:20:01.75,All I thought about since I'vebeen here is bettering my life.
1189,01:20:01.75,01:20:04.33,That's all I've thought aboutand how I can do it.
1190,01:20:04.33,01:20:07.04,"I didn't worry about yourfeelings, I didn't worry about"
1191,01:20:07.04,01:20:10.42,"your feelings, none of you.That was selfish and self-"
1192,01:20:10.42,01:20:15.96,centered of me.People kill for less than what
1193,01:20:15.96,01:20:19.33,"we're playing for right now.Maybe that sounds hard or cold,"
1194,01:20:19.33,01:20:24.50,and it actually turned me intosomebody I don't like.
1195,01:20:24.50,01:20:26.17,"Sarge, you don't have torub it in."
1196,01:20:26.17,01:20:28.83,You don't have to make me feelany lower than what I already
1197,01:20:28.83,01:20:35.12,feel for doing what I did.You don't understand how that's
1198,01:20:35.12,01:20:39.71,bothered me.I highly respect you and to hear
1199,01:20:39.71,01:20:47.17,you say that just kills me.(voice breaking): I apologize
1200,01:20:47.17,01:20:51.75,to each and every one of you.It wasn't the game I intended
1201,01:20:51.75,01:20:54.08,to play.It was the game that ended up
1202,01:20:54.08,01:21:00.04,"playing me, and, uh... if Icould do right again, I would,"
1203,01:21:00.04,01:21:06.04,"and for that I apologize.If you can forgive me, then"
1204,01:21:06.04,01:21:11.54,maybe I can forgive myself.That's all.

1213,01:21:53.71,01:21:56.21,I definitely owed you anapology.
1214,01:21:56.21,01:21:58.04,What happened with you and Juliemakes me feel like I don't
