2,00:00:11.83,00:00:11.83,Americans began the adventure of a lifetime.
3,00:00:14.79,00:00:14.79,(tribesmen shouting) They were marooned at a tribal
4,00:00:19.46,00:00:19.46,village on the remote island nation of Vanuatu.
5,00:00:24.67,00:00:24.67,"In ceremonial fashion, the castaways were divided into a"
6,00:00:28.25,00:00:28.25,tribe of men and a tribe of women.
7,00:00:31.88,00:00:31.88,"While the women were forced to watch from the sidelines, the"
8,00:00:35.54,00:00:35.54,men were given the opportunity to retrieve a traditional spirit
9,00:00:38.88,00:00:38.88,stone used to ward off evil spirits.
10,00:00:42.12,00:00:42.12,You have to get it from atop of that pole.
11,00:00:44.12,00:00:44.12,"If you fail, the women get it. The rivalry between the men and"
12,00:00:49.46,00:00:49.46,the women had begun. (tribes cheering)
13,00:00:52.21,00:00:52.21,>> I think the boys got a lot more out of that ceremony
14,00:00:55.12,00:00:55.12,"than we did, so we're out for blood now."
15,00:00:57.25,00:00:57.25,">> PROBST: Survivors ready, go! At the first immunity challenge,"
16,00:01:01.46,00:01:01.46,the men's Lopevi tribe had a solid lead over the women's
17,00:01:05.17,00:01:05.17,Yasur tribe. >> Get her through! Get her
18,00:01:08.17,00:01:08.17,through! >> PROBST: But Chris couldn't
19,00:01:11.71,00:01:11.71,"make it across the balance beam, and the women won immunity."
20,00:01:15.46,00:01:15.46,"Back at camp, the young guys wanted Chris out."
21,00:01:22.21,00:01:22.21,>> It has to be. >> PROBST: But Sarge proposed a
22,00:01:25.25,00:01:25.25,strategy to keep the older men in the game.
23,00:01:28.21,00:01:28.21,>> The only way we have survival here is if we get rid
24,00:01:30.62,00:01:30.62,of the young people. >> PROBST: First person voted
25,00:01:34.75,00:01:34.75,"out of Vanuatu Islands of Fire, Brook."
26,00:01:37.38,00:01:37.38,"Sarge's plan worked. Perceived as a physical threat,"
27,00:01:41.46,00:01:41.46,Brook was voted out and Chris was saved.
28,00:01:46.46,00:01:46.46,"For immunity, go! At the second immunity"
29,00:01:49.42,00:01:49.42,"challenge... >> Straight, Bubba, right there."
30,00:01:51.04,00:01:51.04,>> PROBST: ...it was the men who came out on top when Sarge led
31,00:01:54.21,00:01:54.21,Lopevi to victory. Lopevi wins immunity!
32,00:01:57.54,00:01:57.54,>> Say my name! >> PROBST: When Yasur went to
33,00:02:01.33,00:02:01.33,"Tribal Council, Dolly was their first victim."
34,00:02:05.21,00:02:05.21,">> If you were not here, we would still have fire..."
35,00:02:07.71,00:02:07.71,">> PROBST: On day seven, Mia and Twila had it out over the work"
36,00:02:10.46,00:02:10.46,"ethic. >> You stay here five minutes,"
37,00:02:12.88,00:02:12.88,"then your asses go down there in the ocean, bitch."
38,00:02:15.42,00:02:15.42,">> It's your only card, keep playing it."
39,00:02:18.04,00:02:18.04,>> PROBST: Mia's temper cost her a shot at a million dollars.
40,00:02:22.79,00:02:22.79,"And at the next two Tribal Councils, Lopevi lost John P."
41,00:02:27.00,00:02:27.00,and Brady. >> Holy...
42,00:02:33.17,00:02:33.17,">> PROBST: On day 11, an earthquake shook the island."
43,00:02:38.79,00:02:38.79,">> Ride 'em, cowboy! >> PROBST: And the shakeups kept"
44,00:02:41.25,00:02:41.25,"coming. Sarge, Scout, over here."
45,00:02:44.42,00:02:44.42,"Sarge and Scout were chosen to pick new tribes, mixing up the"
46,00:02:48.21,00:02:48.21,men and the women. Julie and Twila ended up as the
47,00:02:51.29,00:02:51.29,"only two women on Lopevi, and Rory and Bubba ended up as the"
48,00:02:55.67,00:02:55.67,only two men on Yasur. Twila and Julie fit right in
49,00:03:02.33,00:03:02.33,with the guys of Lopevi. Sarge even made a pact with
50,00:03:05.17,00:03:05.17,Twila. >> So we need someone that knows
51,00:03:07.62,00:03:07.62,what it means to give your word. >> I do.
52,00:03:10.33,00:03:10.33,">> PROBST: But at Yasur, Bubba was uneasy."
53,00:03:13.71,00:03:13.71,">> Being in a tribe with a bunch of women, it does make you"
54,00:03:16.79,00:03:16.79,"nervous because one wrong move, and they'll vote you out."
55,00:03:19.96,00:03:19.96,">> PROBST: So at the next immunity challenge, Bubba tried"
56,00:03:22.67,00:03:22.67,to signal his old tribemates. >> Think about the merge.
57,00:03:26.17,00:03:26.17,>> PROBST: And Ami caught him red-handed.
58,00:03:28.04,00:03:28.04,>> He's making plans with the other team.
59,00:03:29.92,00:03:29.92,Can you see Michael Jordan whispering over to the other
60,00:03:32.38,00:03:32.38,"team what their next play is? Hell, no."
61,00:03:35.04,00:03:35.04,">> PROBST: Bubba got axed. Bubba, the tribe has spoken."
62,00:03:40.21,00:03:40.21,">> There we go. Oh, that's what I like."
63,00:03:44.12,00:03:44.12,>> PROBST: It was becoming clear that Ami was running the show at
64,00:03:46.96,00:03:46.96,"Yasur, and on day 15, the tribe followed her lead when she"
65,00:03:51.75,00:03:51.75,decided to vote out Lisa. The tribe has spoken.
66,00:03:59.00,00:03:59.00,"At Lopevi's next Tribal Council, Julie and Twila joined the older"
67,00:04:02.96,00:04:02.96,guys and sent John K. packing. We're now one tribe.
68,00:04:10.21,00:04:10.21,"On day 20, the tribes merged. Rory rejoined his old buddies"
69,00:04:15.04,00:04:15.04,and immediately let them know that Ami was a threat.
70,00:04:18.04,00:04:18.04,">> As soon as we got over there, they are like ""Rory,"
71,00:04:20.08,00:04:20.08,"you're gone next. Ami told us that."""
72,00:04:23.25,00:04:23.25,>> PROBST: So the guys once again put their faith in Twila
73,00:04:26.17,00:04:26.17,and Julie when they planned to vote out Ami.
74,00:04:28.46,00:04:28.46,">> We got the numbers, we'll be good to go."
75,00:04:31.29,00:04:31.29,>> PROBST: But the men were shocked when Twila and Julie
76,00:04:34.08,00:04:34.08,betrayed them. The women joined forces and
77,00:04:37.08,00:04:37.08,took out Rory. The men were outnumbered and in
78,00:04:42.25,00:04:42.25,"big trouble. Sarge was next, then Chad,"
79,00:04:47.50,00:04:47.50,leaving Chris as the last man standing.
80,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,Let's bring in the people you're going to pair up with.
81,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,Come on in. >> Uh-oh.
82,00:04:55.88,00:04:55.88,>> PROBST: When the survivors' loved ones joined them for the
83,00:04:58.79,00:04:58.79,"immunity challenge on day 27, Chris told his fianc\xc3\xa9e Laurie"
84,00:05:01.75,00:05:01.75,"that he had to win. It was a close race, but with"
85,00:05:09.62,00:05:09.62,"the help of her girlfriend Crissy, Ami won immunity."
86,00:05:12.96,00:05:12.96,">> Yeah, baby. But back at camp, everything got"
87,00:05:20.25,00:05:20.25,turned on its head. >> We made our decision.
88,00:05:22.50,00:05:22.50,">> All right. >> PROBST: First, the women"
89,00:05:24.83,00:05:24.83,"decided to vote out Eliza before Chris, and Twila made a bold"
90,00:05:28.67,00:05:28.67,commitment to stay with Ami and Leanne to the end.
91,00:05:32.25,00:05:32.25,">> On my son, I swear. >> PROBST: But Twila went back"
92,00:05:38.00,00:05:38.00,on her word when she approached Chris with a plot to take out
93,00:05:41.12,00:05:41.12,Leanne and Ami. >> I'll turn the tide.
94,00:05:43.96,00:05:43.96,"I'll take the risk right now. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council, it"
95,00:05:47.71,00:05:47.71,all came together when Eliza and Scout joined them and voted out
96,00:05:51.75,00:05:51.75,Leanne. The tribe has spoken.
97,00:05:55.04,00:05:55.04,The women's alliance had crumbled.
98,00:05:58.46,00:05:58.46,">> Screwed you, didn't I? >> You didn't screw me."
99,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,I'm still in the game. You screwed Leanne.
100,00:06:02.46,00:06:02.46,>> PROBST: Suddenly Ami was fighting for her life.
101,00:06:05.46,00:06:05.46,>> I'm competing with all my heart now.
102,00:06:07.29,00:06:07.29,It's me all the way. Room service!
103,00:06:09.50,00:06:09.50,>> PROBST: When Ami joined Eliza and Chris on a spa reward...
104,00:06:12.46,00:06:12.46,">> Good night, Chris. >> PROBST: ...she did her best"
105,00:06:15.12,00:06:15.12,to get Eliza back on her side. >> Every single time I've had
106,00:06:18.75,00:06:18.75,"your back, every single vote I proved it."
107,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,>> PROBST: But Chris was also working on Eliza.
108,00:06:24.79,00:06:24.79,>> We're pure final four and look at our competition: a
109,00:06:27.46,00:06:27.46,60-year-old woman and Twila. >> PROBST: Chris wins immunity.
110,00:06:34.25,00:06:34.25,Chris won immunity and was safe for three more days.
111,00:06:37.29,00:06:37.29,">> Good job, dude. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
112,00:06:40.25,00:06:40.25,Ami kept fighting when she when she confronted Twila about
113,00:06:42.92,00:06:42.92,swearing on her son's name. >> I can't imagine.
114,00:06:45.25,00:06:45.25,>> I am not the only freakin' person that has
115,00:06:47.96,00:06:47.96,lied in this game. Get over it!
116,00:06:50.04,00:06:50.04,You've been had. Screw you! >> PROBST: Eliza had a big
117,00:06:53.17,00:06:53.17,decision to make. Would you miss Ami if she
118,00:06:55.50,00:06:55.50,"was gone? >> Yeah, I'd miss Ami a lot."
119,00:06:57.04,00:06:57.04,>> Stop crying. >> PROBST: But when the votes
120,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,came in... 13th person voted out of
121,00:07:05.33,00:07:05.33,Survivor: Vanuatu... Ami was finally dethroned.
122,00:07:09.42,00:07:09.42,"Chris had come a long way, but he knew the game was not over."
123,00:07:15.12,00:07:15.12,>> It's probably in my best interest to go with you and
124,00:07:17.75,00:07:17.75,Eliza. I'm kind of playing Julie and
125,00:07:19.33,00:07:19.33,"Eliza; at the same time, I'm playing Scout and Twila."
126,00:07:22.42,00:07:22.42,They're all women. How do you trust any of them?
127,00:07:24.88,00:07:24.88,>> You know Scout and Twila are not going to go against
128,00:07:27.79,00:07:27.79,"each other. With the two of them, meaning"
129,00:07:29.79,00:07:29.79,a hundred percent we do not get to the final two.
130,00:07:32.42,00:07:32.42,">> PROBST: The heat was on, and no one was safe."
131,00:07:35.83,00:07:35.83,>> What's up? >> I don't know.
132,00:07:38.04,00:07:38.04,"You tell me. >> I think you're a liar, T."
133,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,>> Who else has been lying? >> You've been trying to
134,00:07:42.25,00:07:42.25,plot against me since day one. >> You're driving everybody
135,00:07:45.25,00:07:45.25,"friggin' nuts. Now, Chris, what are you"
136,00:07:46.83,00:07:46.83,thinking? >> What?
137,00:07:48.12,00:07:48.12,"You know, I'm just laying here, you know, in the hammock."
138,00:07:51.71,00:07:51.71,">> PROBST: With tensions boiling over, Chris made one last move"
139,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,when he guaranteed Julie his loyalty.
140,00:07:57.67,00:07:57.67,">> What I'm comparing this to is my friendship with you, compared"
141,00:08:01.88,00:08:01.88,to my friendship with Twila. >> PROBST: Both Julie and Eliza
142,00:08:04.38,00:08:04.38,believed Chris when he said Twila would be the next to go.
143,00:08:07.38,00:08:07.38,">> Chris has proved me right so far, and I just hope he"
144,00:08:11.58,00:08:11.58,continues to do so. >> PROBST: But at Tribal
145,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,Council... 14th person voted out of
146,00:08:16.00,00:08:16.00,Survivor: Vanuatu... Eliza was shocked when Chris
147,00:08:19.71,00:08:19.71,betrayed his pal Julie and helped vote her out.
148,00:08:26.29,00:08:26.29,"Now only four remain: Chris, Eliza, Scout and Twila."
149,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,"Tonight, they will compete in their final immunity challenges."
150,00:08:37.12,00:08:37.12,Two will continue on to face the jury.
151,00:08:39.50,00:08:39.50,One will outlast all the rest and become the sole survivor.
152,00:08:45.12,00:08:45.12,(theme song playing) >> I voted off Julie tonight
153,00:10:17.12,00:10:17.12,"at Tribal Council, took Eliza by surprise."
154,00:10:20.12,00:10:20.12,"Oh, well, Julie had it coming. She pulled a fast one on me"
155,00:10:23.58,00:10:23.58,"after the merge, I got her back. It's all in good game."
156,00:10:27.17,00:10:27.17,">> This is, this is, yeah, this is hard for me..."
157,00:10:33.88,00:10:33.88,"knowing who to trust. >> It's part of the game, Eliza."
158,00:10:44.29,00:10:44.29,"Not everyone plays it that way. >> I know, but I would never"
159,00:10:47.08,00:10:47.08,say that I thought that somebody who was still here didn't
160,00:10:51.17,00:10:51.17,deserve to be here. >> I don't think you
161,00:10:53.21,00:10:53.21,"deserve to be here, Eliza. The only reason you're still"
162,00:10:56.08,00:10:56.08,here is because you've been riding everybody's coattails
163,00:10:58.04,00:10:58.04,from day one. That's the only reason you're
164,00:11:00.21,00:11:00.21,"here, period. >> That's not true."
165,00:11:02.25,00:11:02.25,That's blatantly not true. >> You have done nothing
166,00:11:04.50,00:11:04.50,"for the camp. You've done nothing, but boil"
167,00:11:06.58,00:11:06.58,freakin' water. You don't deserve to be here in
168,00:11:09.04,00:11:09.04,"my eyes. >> Well, T, I don't think"
169,00:11:11.08,00:11:11.08,"you deserve to be here. I think, you know..."
170,00:11:12.96,00:11:12.96,>> At least I've played the game and worked hard.
171,00:11:15.12,00:11:15.12,That's more than I can say for you.
172,00:11:16.33,00:11:16.33,>> Working hard is not necessarily playing the game.
173,00:11:19.29,00:11:19.29,Conserving your energy and kicking ass at challenges.
174,00:11:21.29,00:11:21.29,Who's won the most rewards of anyone here?
175,00:11:23.12,00:11:23.12,">> Well, you might as well have all your strength to do that."
176,00:11:26.12,00:11:26.12,">> Yeah, well, maybe that's how I'm playing the game."
177,00:11:28.17,00:11:28.17,"If you conserved your energy, maybe you could do better at"
178,00:11:30.92,00:11:30.92,challenges. >> God dang.
179,00:11:32.54,00:11:32.54,">> Probably not, but maybe. >> Probably not, you're right."
180,00:11:36.62,00:11:36.62,"The only reason you're here, Eliza, is everybody has used you"
181,00:11:40.12,00:11:40.12,up to this point. That's the only reason.
182,00:11:52.92,00:11:52.92,>> I think Twila is a dumb bitch.
183,00:11:55.33,00:11:55.33,"I mean, I just don't want to see either of the two of them make"
184,00:11:58.25,00:11:58.25,the final two. I just don't want to see it.
185,00:12:00.04,00:12:00.04,It just kills me if that happens.
186,00:12:02.00,00:12:02.00,>> Julie wasn't the answer. That's all there is to it.
187,00:12:04.67,00:12:04.67,">> Now, tomorrow, assuming you still... are going to stick"
188,00:12:08.54,00:12:08.54,with an alliance to me... >> That's never changed.
189,00:12:12.04,00:12:12.04,What I did today was for our alliance.
190,00:12:14.71,00:12:14.71,"You'll see, okay? >> I believe you."
191,00:12:16.25,00:12:16.25,I believe you. >> Why wouldn't you?
192,00:12:17.75,00:12:17.75,Have I ever lied to you? >> No.
193,00:12:19.92,00:12:19.92,">> Julie was a player, Eliza, a player."
194,00:12:24.12,00:12:24.12,She didn't give a ... about you. She gave a ... about you
195,00:12:26.83,00:12:26.83,"when her neck was on the line. She voted for you, remember?"
196,00:12:30.50,00:12:30.50,">> Mm-hmm. I know. Yeah, but..."
197,00:12:40.71,00:12:40.71,>> You think you can get one of them to turn on the other.
198,00:12:46.17,00:12:46.17,>> Mm-hmm. >> I don't know.
199,00:12:48.50,00:12:48.50,I don't think much about any of the women here since the final
200,00:12:51.71,00:12:51.71,"seven of us were here. I mean, they are all just"
201,00:12:55.58,00:12:55.58,"playing the game. They turned on each other, and"
202,00:12:57.75,00:12:57.75,"they all got their own opinion, and Eliza and Twila don't like"
203,00:13:00.88,00:13:00.88,"each other, I love it. It puts a little bit of, you"
204,00:13:04.08,00:13:04.08,"know, excitement in camp. >> I thought I would be here"
205,00:13:27.25,00:13:27.25,"on day 37, yes, but if you would have told me that this was the"
206,00:13:29.88,00:13:29.88,"group of people I was going to be with, I would have laughed"
207,00:13:32.38,00:13:32.38,in your face. I never would have imagined that
208,00:13:34.46,00:13:34.46,this would be the final four. >> I guess we could get that
209,00:13:38.08,00:13:38.08,"manioc on. If we don't, we ain't gonna get"
210,00:13:39.58,00:13:39.58,to eat it. >> Because there's only
211,00:13:41.04,00:13:41.04,"four of us left, it's pretty clear, you know, who is going to"
212,00:13:44.29,00:13:44.29,stick together and who is going to vote for who at tonight's
213,00:13:47.12,00:13:47.12,Tribal Council. Scout and Twila have been
214,00:13:51.00,00:13:51.00,"wanting to vote for me for a very long time, and I think that"
215,00:13:54.25,00:13:54.25,"would give them a lot of satisfaction to finally do that,"
216,00:13:57.17,00:13:57.17,so I really need immunity to stay in this game.
217,00:13:59.88,00:13:59.88,"If I don't get immunity, I pray that it's Chris who does."
218,00:14:19.21,00:14:19.21,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to the challenge?
219,00:14:20.92,00:14:20.92,>> Absolutely. >> PROBST: First things first.
220,00:14:22.75,00:14:22.75,"Give it up, Eliza. Immunity back up for grabs."
221,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,"Today, you will take part in the first ever Survivor vertical"
222,00:14:35.58,00:14:35.58,maze. You'll make your way up and
223,00:14:37.25,00:14:37.25,"through this maze collecting ten pairs of wooden tiles, one pair"
224,00:14:41.79,00:14:41.79,at a time. When you've collected all ten
225,00:14:43.96,00:14:43.96,"pairs and you have them at your station, you'll untie them to"
226,00:14:46.62,00:14:46.62,reveal ten letters. Use the letters to form a two-
227,00:14:51.04,00:14:51.04,word answer. First person to solve this
228,00:14:53.88,00:14:53.88,"correctly wins immunity, guaranteed spot in the final"
229,00:14:57.25,00:14:57.25,three. You guys ready to do it?
230,00:14:58.50,00:14:58.50,>> ALL: Yeah. >> PROBST: Wait for my go.
231,00:15:00.71,00:15:00.71,We'll get started. For immunity.
232,00:15:06.29,00:15:06.29,Survivors ready... go! Chris and Twila in first.
233,00:15:12.08,00:15:12.08,Eliza right behind. Scout going to give it a go.
234,00:15:21.25,00:15:21.25,Chris going up high. Twila going down low.
235,00:15:26.67,00:15:26.67,Remember your color. Twila back with her first pair.
236,00:15:38.62,00:15:38.62,Chris has his first pair; he's got to get down now.
237,00:15:43.04,00:15:43.04,>> Where did they go? >> PROBST: Eliza having no luck.
238,00:15:46.46,00:15:46.46,Twila at her second pair. That helps Eliza who just
239,00:15:51.17,00:15:51.17,"follows right behind. Eliza out with her first, Twila"
240,00:16:02.33,00:16:02.33,"out with her second, Chris out with his first."
241,00:16:04.67,00:16:04.67,"Scout, she has her first pair. Eliza with her second pair,"
242,00:16:08.88,00:16:08.88,"Chris with his second pair. Twila, Chris, Eliza all with"
243,00:16:14.92,00:16:14.92,two pairs. Twila got her third pair.
244,00:16:22.88,00:16:22.88,Twila racing down with third pair.
245,00:16:25.96,00:16:25.96,">> Watch out, Scout, go. >> PROBST: Twila moves into the"
246,00:16:29.67,00:16:29.67,"lead with her third pair. Eliza has her third pair,"
247,00:16:32.62,00:16:32.62,getting down. Chris has his third pair.
248,00:16:38.92,00:16:38.92,Eliza goes up high and has her fourth pair; Scout with her
249,00:16:42.92,00:16:42.92,second pair. Twila with four pairs now.
250,00:16:48.42,00:16:48.42,Chris has his fourth pair; got to get back to that exit.

253,00:17:00.25,00:17:00.25,"Eliza with five, Chris with five, Twila with five."
254,00:17:03.58,00:17:03.58,We're tied up. Twila up high has her sixth.
255,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"Chris has his sixth in his mouth, trying to get back"
256,00:17:12.25,00:17:12.25,to that exit. Chris moves into the lead with
257,00:17:14.46,00:17:14.46,six pairs. Twila trying to get back to the
258,00:17:17.12,00:17:17.12,exit now. Twila with six pairs.
259,00:17:23.83,00:17:23.83,Eliza with sixth in hand. >> Ow. Watch out for me.
260,00:17:29.96,00:17:29.96,>> PROBST: Chris and Eliza keep bumping into each other.
261,00:17:33.17,00:17:33.17,"Twila with seven, Chris with seven."
262,00:17:37.04,00:17:37.04,Eliza has her seventh. Everybody coming back with

266,00:17:54.92,00:17:54.92,He only has one left. Eliza right behind with eight.
267,00:17:58.25,00:17:58.25,She's got two left. >> Where's the other?
268,00:18:04.04,00:18:04.04,>> PROBST: Twila with nine and Chris with nine.
269,00:18:06.92,00:18:06.92,They both only have one pair left.
270,00:18:09.79,00:18:09.79,"Chris has his tenth pair. >> Go, go."
271,00:18:13.88,00:18:13.88,>> PROBST: Twila has her last one.
272,00:18:17.17,00:18:17.17,"Toss the blanks, there's one letter in each pair."
273,00:18:24.04,00:18:24.04,Looking for two words. A two-word answer.
274,00:18:27.29,00:18:27.29,"Eliza not giving up, takes a long jump."
275,00:18:32.17,00:18:32.17,Eliza back with her ninth pair. She's got one left.
276,00:18:35.71,00:18:35.71,"She's got to find it, then got to get it."
277,00:18:37.67,00:18:37.67,Chris already working on it. Eliza back with her last pair.
278,00:18:50.50,00:18:50.50,">> I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it."
279,00:18:53.54,00:18:53.54,I got it! >> PROBST: Chris wins immunity.
280,00:18:55.92,00:18:55.92,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"
281,00:19:04.54,00:19:04.54,Yeah! Final three.
282,00:19:12.00,00:19:12.00,">> PROBST: All right, Chris, get over here."
283,00:19:14.46,00:19:14.46,"Big-time immunity, spot in the final three."
284,00:19:17.08,00:19:17.08,">> Yeah! >> PROBST: Sadly, after 37 long,"
285,00:19:20.92,00:19:20.92,"tough days out here, tonight at Tribal Council, this game will"
286,00:19:24.12,00:19:24.12,come to an end. Somebody is going home.
287,00:19:26.25,00:19:26.25,I'll see you at Tribal. >> Back home.
288,00:19:40.83,00:19:40.83,>> Back home. >> I'll tell you what.
289,00:19:42.58,00:19:42.58,>> Hell of a deal. >> Of course I'm going to
290,00:19:44.42,00:19:44.42,"say it's a beautiful day, but it really is a beautiful day."
291,00:19:46.67,00:19:46.67,>> It's a beautiful day. That necklace looks good on you.
292,00:19:49.96,00:19:49.96,">> Oh, man, I needed it bad. I never give up."
293,00:19:53.25,00:19:53.25,That's the one thing. I just knew.
294,00:19:54.83,00:19:54.83,"I'm the last man standing, I'm not giving up on this game."
295,00:19:57.62,00:19:57.62,I'm going to hang this up. >> Right on your tail.
296,00:20:00.83,00:20:00.83,">> Twila gave me a run for my money, but immunity is"
297,00:20:03.25,00:20:03.25,what I wanted. That's all I needed.
298,00:20:06.21,00:20:06.21,It's a good day. >> Go collect as many of these
299,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,little dead ones till we get a pile of them.
300,00:20:14.54,00:20:14.54,>> Okay. >> I definitely had my
301,00:20:16.75,00:20:16.75,"work cut out for me. >> Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow, yow!"
302,00:20:20.08,00:20:20.08,>> An alliance you've got with somebody or trust-- it's not
303,00:20:23.71,00:20:23.71,meaning a whole lot right now-- it's making that final two and
304,00:20:26.58,00:20:26.58,getting a chance to win. >> Us three.
305,00:20:30.88,00:20:30.88,">> Oh, you guys. Listen, I want to tell you guys"
306,00:20:35.42,00:20:35.42,that I have wanted this day to come.
307,00:20:38.08,00:20:38.08,>> It's gonna happen tonight. >> Whoo!
308,00:20:42.08,00:20:42.08,"Right now, I just want to gloat. I want to gloat that the little"
309,00:20:45.08,00:20:45.08,"wench is going home today, tonight."
310,00:20:48.08,00:20:48.08,"I'm gloating. Chris, everybody, does this mean"
311,00:20:50.92,00:20:50.92,I don't need to pack my bags tonight?
312,00:20:53.17,00:20:53.17,(laughing): I know... >> No more.
313,00:20:55.25,00:20:55.25,I'm tired of ya asking. Twila is so wound up.
314,00:20:58.33,00:20:58.33,"You know, Twila works on me. So, I'm gonna have to deal with"
315,00:21:00.58,00:21:00.58,Twila all afternoon. She gets on my nerves.
316,00:21:03.08,00:21:03.08,She's just totally out-of- control nervous all the time.
317,00:21:06.67,00:21:06.67,"If you want to josh Eliza a little bit here and there,"
318,00:21:08.96,00:21:08.96,go ahead. >> She was such a smart
319,00:21:10.08,00:21:10.08,"ass and arrogant bitch last night, it just pissed me off."
320,00:21:12.96,00:21:12.96,">> Get her blood boiling a little bit, because she come"
321,00:21:15.21,00:21:15.21,down on you yesterday and was trying to make you look bad.
322,00:21:17.71,00:21:17.71,>> I know. >> So just wait about a
323,00:21:19.25,00:21:19.25,half an hour before and just ride her like a dog.
324,00:21:22.08,00:21:22.08,">> Thanks, darling. I want to gloat, but that's just"
325,00:21:27.17,00:21:27.17,"what Chris wants me to do. See, he..."
326,00:21:30.75,00:21:30.75,"The more I piss everybody off right before they leave, the"
327,00:21:32.71,00:21:32.71,more easier it is if we're the final two that he gets all
328,00:21:35.33,00:21:35.33,"the votes. So, you know, I see what he's"
329,00:21:37.21,00:21:37.21,doing. He's working it.
330,00:21:38.46,00:21:38.46,>> I've been wanting to talk to you so bad because
331,00:21:40.46,00:21:40.46,"you're the one that initially come to me and said, ""I want to"
332,00:21:42.96,00:21:42.96,"try to keep you in the game and play the game with you."""
333,00:21:45.79,00:21:45.79,">> Right. >> And that's, that's what led"
334,00:21:47.42,00:21:47.42,me to want to just finally sit down and talk to you.
335,00:21:49.33,00:21:49.33,">> I swear to God, I've wanted that since the day I saw you."
336,00:21:52.54,00:21:52.54,"Back there, I mean it. I said I want to play the game"
337,00:21:55.42,00:21:55.42,with that guy right there. >> It's going to be a
338,00:21:58.17,00:21:58.17,long afternoon for sure. Just pretty much more I've
339,00:22:00.58,00:22:00.58,"to put up with three women all afternoon, and that sucks."
340,00:22:04.75,00:22:04.75,"My alliance is with all three of them, and, you know, they're"
341,00:22:08.58,00:22:08.58,all bidding for their spot in the final three.
342,00:22:11.12,00:22:11.12,"I mean, we're both gonna vote for Twila, and whatever happens"
343,00:22:14.58,00:22:14.58,happens. Twila thinks you're gonna
344,00:22:16.21,00:22:16.21,go home. She has no idea.
345,00:22:18.12,00:22:18.12,They don't know. I've never told them.
346,00:22:20.92,00:22:20.92,No one knows me and you made a pact.
347,00:22:23.46,00:22:23.46,They have no idea. >> I'm lucky enough to be
348,00:22:25.54,00:22:25.54,in the final four with someone that I feel that I can put all
349,00:22:28.04,00:22:28.04,"of my trust into, and now that we've made this pact, this final"
350,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,"two alliance, neither one of us is going to vote against the"
351,00:22:35.58,00:22:35.58,"other person, and we're going to do everything we can to get to"
352,00:22:38.00,00:22:38.00,the final two together. Have you tried to make a deal
353,00:22:39.75,00:22:39.75,with Chris? >> I definitely thought
354,00:22:41.67,00:22:41.67,about it. Have you tried to make a deal?
355,00:22:47.04,00:22:47.04,>> Huh? >> Have you tried to make
356,00:22:48.46,00:22:48.46,a deal? >> I've tried to make a deal
357,00:22:50.08,00:22:50.08,with everyone. But I know that Twila is already
358,00:22:52.25,00:22:52.25,"trying to wheel and deal, so I think you should get in on that,"
359,00:22:55.04,00:22:55.04,"too, because I would rather see you and Chris in the final two."
360,00:22:59.25,00:22:59.25,">> You would? >> Oh, yeah."
361,00:23:00.54,00:23:00.54,"Oh, yeah. And, yes, call me sour grapes,"
362,00:23:03.88,00:23:03.88,but... and I blatantly would rather see people in the final
363,00:23:07.12,00:23:07.12,"two that I like, that I would be... I would feel comfortable"
364,00:23:10.08,00:23:10.08,with either of the two people winning.
365,00:23:12.96,00:23:12.96,"I'd feel comfortable with that, as opposed to somebody who I"
366,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,feel like has lost their integrity throughout this game.
367,00:23:19.12,00:23:19.12,"So, you want to vote for Twila with me tonight, huh, huh?"
368,00:23:23.58,00:23:23.58,>> I thought about it. >> I didn't come here to get
369,00:23:31.12,00:23:31.12,"second place, and I sure as hell didn't come here to get"
370,00:23:33.29,00:23:33.29,"third or fourth. I come here to win, you know."
371,00:23:35.25,00:23:35.25,I don't look at myself as being aligned with Scout and Twila
372,00:23:38.21,00:23:38.21,"right now. There's no loyalty, no trust."
373,00:23:40.96,00:23:40.96,There's nothing in the game right now.
374,00:23:43.04,00:23:43.04,It's all about just getting yourself to the next step.
375,00:23:45.83,00:23:45.83,To hell with everybody else. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
376,00:24:02.58,00:24:02.58,"the members of our jury: Sarge, Chad, Leanne, Ami and"
377,00:24:08.17,00:24:08.17,"Julie, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
378,00:24:18.96,00:24:18.96,"37 days; hard-fought, long days. Tonight, this game will come to"
379,00:24:24.12,00:24:24.12,"an end for somebody. That somebody will not be you,"
380,00:24:27.17,00:24:27.17,"Chris, wearing immunity. I don't think I've ever seen you"
381,00:24:30.67,00:24:30.67,"as excited as you were today. Eliza, do you remember back to"
382,00:24:33.58,00:24:33.58,"the first challenge, the one guy who couldn't get across the"
383,00:24:36.33,00:24:36.33,"balance beam? >> Yeah, this guy right here."
384,00:24:39.04,00:24:39.04,"I thought he was gone, first day."
385,00:24:40.71,00:24:40.71,">> You got to bring up the beam, don't you, man?"
386,00:24:43.08,00:24:43.08,You got to bring up the balance beam.
387,00:24:44.58,00:24:44.58,">> PROBST: Well, at this point, it's something you've overcome"
388,00:24:47.12,00:24:47.12,now. You're still in this game.
389,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,">> You're right. Got off to a bad start, no"
390,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,"doubt. >> PROBST: Eliza, when you see"
391,00:24:53.00,00:24:53.00,"it around Chris's neck, are you envious or do you think, ""Hey,"
392,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,"you know, I like him?"" >> Well, of course I'm envious,"
393,00:24:58.33,00:24:58.33,"but you know, if I couldn't have it, Chris would be my"
394,00:25:01.58,00:25:01.58,next choice for the person to have individual immunity.
395,00:25:04.58,00:25:04.58,"I mean, that's no secret. So, yeah, I'm definitely happy"
396,00:25:07.17,00:25:07.17,for Chris. >> PROBST: And you say it's no
397,00:25:08.71,00:25:08.71,secret. You're referring to the fact
398,00:25:10.25,00:25:10.25,that you and Twila have been pretty open about... you're just
399,00:25:12.25,00:25:12.25,different people. >> Yes.
400,00:25:14.38,00:25:14.38,>> PROBST: And it does seem like there's a friendship with Chris.
401,00:25:16.79,00:25:16.79,">> Yes, yes, we've definitely gotten really close and, you"
402,00:25:19.75,00:25:19.75,"know, I'm glad that we've gotten to know each other and formed as"
403,00:25:23.21,00:25:23.21,"strong a bond as we have. >> PROBST: Twila, on the other"
404,00:25:25.17,00:25:25.17,"hand, there have been times out here when you've said"
405,00:25:28.08,00:25:28.08,"in no uncertain terms, ""I like these people, but I don't trust"
406,00:25:30.17,00:25:30.17,"anybody."" >> Exactly."
407,00:25:32.71,00:25:32.71,I have said that. >> PROBST: Still feel that way?
408,00:25:37.33,00:25:37.33,"You're not that comfortable? >> Not that comfortable, but"
409,00:25:40.25,00:25:40.25,"maybe I'm wrong, but this is the first night since I've been"
410,00:25:43.00,00:25:43.00,"here, I've been at ease. I feel in my heart that I've"
411,00:25:46.25,00:25:46.25,"been at ease, the first night. >> PROBST: Scout, this is where"
412,00:25:49.96,00:25:49.96,"it gets really complicated, because you can't risk telling"
413,00:25:53.04,00:25:53.04,"anybody the truth anyway, because there's too much time to"
414,00:25:56.38,00:25:56.38,"maneuver out from under you if you do tell them, so everybody"
415,00:25:59.29,00:25:59.29,has to keep a secret. Somebody here is gonna be
416,00:26:01.67,00:26:01.67,"surprised, and yet, Scout, you don't seem too worried."
417,00:26:04.42,00:26:04.42,">> It would surprise me. It could be me tonight, though,"
418,00:26:07.25,00:26:07.25,"and if it does, I'll go... and get up and get my torch and"
419,00:26:11.62,00:26:11.62,"walk out. >> PROBST: Chris, you're a"
420,00:26:13.42,00:26:13.42,little bit in the driver's seat because you seem to have
421,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,relationships with all three of these women.
422,00:26:18.29,00:26:18.29,>> Absolutely I have a relationship with all three of
423,00:26:21.25,00:26:21.25,"these women, but, you know, I can't take away my focus of"
424,00:26:24.04,00:26:24.04,playing the game. No matter if I've developed a
425,00:26:26.79,00:26:26.79,friendship with somebody. Friendship... game.
426,00:26:30.46,00:26:30.46,Friendship right there. I'm gonna have to put it back
427,00:26:32.96,00:26:32.96,here tonight. It's time to play the game.
428,00:26:34.50,00:26:34.50,">> PROBST: Twila, been days out here where you went to bed and"
429,00:26:37.92,00:26:37.92,"thought, ""Okay, I was maybe a little rough today."""
430,00:26:40.96,00:26:40.96,">> Most definitely, yeah. There's, there's a couple of"
431,00:26:43.92,00:26:43.92,major mistakes that I've made out here and I feel pretty
432,00:26:46.92,00:26:46.92,bad about. The main thing that comes to
433,00:26:49.04,00:26:49.04,"mind is swearing on my son's name, and I'm very ashamed of"
434,00:26:52.29,00:26:52.29,"that, but I can't take it back. >> PROBST: What do you think his"
435,00:26:55.71,00:26:55.71,"take, James, will be on that? >> If I win a million dollars,"
436,00:26:58.29,00:26:58.29,"he'll say, ""Hell, yes, Mom, you can swear on my name any"
437,00:27:01.08,00:27:01.08,"time you want."" But I just shouldn't have done"
438,00:27:03.75,00:27:03.75,it. That's the bottom line.
439,00:27:05.42,00:27:05.42,I should have never have brought his name into it.
440,00:27:08.75,00:27:08.75,"I should have never done it. >> PROBST: All right, Chris."
441,00:27:12.96,00:27:12.96,"You have immunity. At this point in the game, I"
442,00:27:15.04,00:27:15.04,"think you'd be a fool to give it up probably, but you never know"
443,00:27:18.08,00:27:18.08,what somebody's strategy is. >> I am not a fool.
444,00:27:21.04,00:27:21.04,"I'm not giving up immunity. >> PROBST: Okay, you cannot vote"
445,00:27:24.12,00:27:24.12,"for Chris. Eliza, Scout, Twila-- one of you"
446,00:27:26.79,00:27:26.79,is about to go home. Let's find out who that's gonna
447,00:27:29.21,00:27:29.21,be. It is time to vote.
448,00:27:30.67,00:27:30.67,"Eliza, you're up. >> Twila, I am voting for you"
449,00:27:42.54,00:27:42.54,for the third time this game. You're like the cockroach that
450,00:27:45.58,00:27:45.58,won't die under the refrigerator.
451,00:27:47.17,00:27:47.17,"Hopefully, you're going home tonight."
452,00:27:56.04,00:27:56.04,>> You have drove me crazy from day one.
453,00:27:58.33,00:27:58.33,"If you go home tonight, it's gonna be the happiest night"
454,00:28:01.12,00:28:01.12,since I've been here. You've got a lot of growing up
455,00:28:04.21,00:28:04.21,to do. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
456,00:28:19.25,00:28:19.25,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
457,00:28:33.25,00:28:33.25,decision is final. The person voted out will be
458,00:28:35.04,00:28:35.04,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
459,00:28:36.96,00:28:36.96,I'll read the votes. The first vote-- Eliza.
460,00:28:48.62,00:28:48.62,"Twila. One vote Eliza, one vote Twila."
461,00:28:55.04,00:28:55.04,"Liza. Two votes Eliza, one vote Twila."
462,00:28:59.54,00:28:59.54,I'll read the last vote. The 15th person voted out of
463,00:29:04.67,00:29:04.67,Survivor: Vanuatu-- Eliza. You need to bring me your torch.
464,00:29:18.21,00:29:18.21,"Eliza, the tribe has spoken. Well, you've reached a critical"
465,00:29:37.62,00:29:37.62,point in the game: final three. Tomorrow you'll take part in the
466,00:29:41.08,00:29:41.08,last immunity challenge. The winner guaranteed a spot in
467,00:29:44.58,00:29:44.58,the final two and gets to decide who sits next to them at the
468,00:29:48.25,00:29:48.25,final Tribal Council. Get a good night's sleep.
469,00:29:51.08,00:29:51.08,Grab your torches and head back to camp.
470,00:29:53.42,00:29:53.42,Good night. >> I'm definitely disappointed
471,00:29:59.54,00:29:59.54,that Chris voted for me. I was shocked that he wrote my
472,00:30:02.17,00:30:02.17,"name down when he said he wasn't going to and he, you know, gave"
473,00:30:04.75,00:30:04.75,"me his word, the whole pact. It turns out I did not have a"
474,00:30:06.75,00:30:06.75,"single ally this entire game. I look for the best in people,"
475,00:30:11.83,00:30:11.83,"and it's definitely going to change my outlook and, yeah,"
476,00:30:15.21,00:30:15.21,"that hurts. >> Chris, did you see"
477,00:30:28.62,00:30:28.62,that look Eliza gave you? If looks was to kill...
478,00:30:30.62,00:30:30.62,">> I mean, I don't know what her problem is."
479,00:30:32.04,00:30:32.04,I just stick with my alliance. That's all I do.
480,00:30:34.17,00:30:34.17,I ain't like her. See you later.
481,00:30:36.04,00:30:36.04,">> You know what? There is a merciful God,"
482,00:30:38.17,00:30:38.17,you guys. Liza is not going to be running
483,00:30:39.67,00:30:39.67,her mouth. This night is beautiful because
484,00:30:43.33,00:30:43.33,it's quiet. There is no Eliza noises in
485,00:30:51.17,00:30:51.17,camp. It was kind of like getting
486,00:30:53.96,00:30:53.96,"a thorn out of your foot or a thorn out of your side,"
487,00:30:56.71,00:30:56.71,you know? She just drove me nuts for so
488,00:30:58.25,00:30:58.25,long. >> Look up in the sky and
489,00:31:00.54,00:31:00.54,look how many stars there are. >> It's gorgeous.
490,00:31:04.08,00:31:04.08,">> I never dreamed I'd be playing the game the way I am,"
491,00:31:07.08,00:31:07.08,"lying, deceiving. You ain't got no choice because"
492,00:31:10.29,00:31:10.29,I tell you what. If you don't step it up and
493,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,"you don't start playing the game in your best interest, to"
494,00:31:16.58,00:31:16.58,"benefit and go to the end, you'll be sent packing."
495,00:31:21.12,00:31:21.12,"And, uh, going back home with a million bucks..."
496,00:31:26.25,00:31:26.25,"that'll change your life. >> Hey, Chris, here comes Jeff."
497,00:31:42.08,00:31:42.08,"Jeff, I was gonna meet you, but they don't want to stumble over"
498,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,the rocks. >> PROBST: That's all right.
499,00:31:46.88,00:31:46.88,"I'll come to you. Well, it's day 38."
500,00:31:50.71,00:31:50.71,>> Yeah. >> Whoo.
501,00:31:52.62,00:31:52.62,>> PROBST: It's time for your final rite of passage.
502,00:31:54.88,00:31:54.88,I know you remember the story I told you recently about Roy
503,00:31:57.62,00:31:57.62,"Mata, a very famous chief who was poisoned to death by his"
504,00:32:01.71,00:32:01.71,brother and then buried along with all of his chiefs and
505,00:32:04.42,00:32:04.42,"their wives. Many of them were buried alive,"
506,00:32:06.33,00:32:06.33,and they were buried on an island that was then considered
507,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,"so taboo after that burial, that nobody visited for 700 years."
508,00:32:13.88,00:32:13.88,"You may have figured it out. If you haven't, you've been"
509,00:32:17.12,00:32:17.12,"sitting across it for 38 days. >> See, I figured that out."
510,00:32:19.79,00:32:19.79,">> That's the island, no way. >> PROBST: Aratoca Island, also"
511,00:32:23.83,00:32:23.83,known as Hat Island for the shape of it.
512,00:32:25.88,00:32:25.88,"That island is the most sacred spot in Vanuatu, so it is a"
513,00:32:29.62,00:32:29.62,fitting spot for your final rite of passage.
514,00:32:33.04,00:32:33.04,You're gonna paddle over. You'll find 15 torches of the
515,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,survivors who are no longer in this game.
516,00:32:39.29,00:32:39.29,Take a moment at each one of them to reflect on what impact
517,00:32:42.71,00:32:42.71,"they had on the game, what impact they've have had on you,"
518,00:32:45.46,00:32:45.46,if any. You will then go to the actual
519,00:32:48.12,00:32:48.12,"burial site of Roy Mata, make an offering."
520,00:32:51.79,00:32:51.79,"This is a gesture of thanks to Vanuatu for our time out here,"
521,00:32:55.83,00:32:55.83,so bring something of value to leave at this gravesite.
522,00:32:59.96,00:32:59.96,"When you're finished, I'll meet you on the other side for your"
523,00:33:02.21,00:33:02.21,final immunity challenge. Enjoy this time.
524,00:33:03.88,00:33:03.88,I'll see you over there. >> Thanks.
525,00:33:06.75,00:33:06.75,"Being in the final three is amazing to me, but I don't know"
526,00:33:10.12,00:33:10.12,what's going to happen. It's going to be a happy day and
527,00:33:13.67,00:33:13.67,"a sad day all up in one. >> At this pace, we ought to"
528,00:33:25.88,00:33:25.88,get there about noon tomorrow. >> We're making progress.
529,00:33:55.58,00:33:55.58,"Brook, he was our first. Really never really had much of"
530,00:34:00.42,00:34:00.42,a chance. >> Yeah.
531,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,>> It was a crazy three days. You've got to out-will the
532,00:34:04.42,00:34:04.42,"environment, you got to outplay the other people."
533,00:34:07.04,00:34:07.04,"You get caught in one bad day, one bad situation, snip,"
534,00:34:10.17,00:34:10.17,you're gone. And that's what happened to me.
535,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,>> Dolly was a very personable young woman and had the most
536,00:34:17.58,00:34:17.58,beautiful eyes I've ever seen. >> My experience out here
537,00:34:21.25,00:34:21.25,"was short but excellent, um, a little confusing because I found"
538,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,"myself caught in the middle, and I wasn't able to make up my mind"
539,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,"quick enough, and it backfired. >> This whole experience is"
540,00:34:37.75,00:34:37.75,really going to change the way I look at things from here on out.
541,00:34:41.29,00:34:41.29,"I'm going to appreciate those around me more-- emotionally,"
542,00:34:44.58,00:34:44.58,spiritually. I'm going to appreciate fire.
543,00:34:52.04,00:34:52.04,>> I'm usually pretty good at getting along with almost
544,00:34:54.29,00:34:54.29,"anybody, but, again, I'm Italian, I couldn't control"
545,00:34:57.79,00:34:57.79,the temper and I clashed with a lot of people.
546,00:35:00.79,00:35:00.79,Ultimately it got me voted out of the game.
547,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,>> I don't know that I could've done anything differently after
548,00:35:08.96,00:35:08.96,the first hour of the game. Things were polarized so
549,00:35:12.29,00:35:12.29,quickly. I probably shouldn't have
550,00:35:14.58,00:35:14.58,climbed that damn pole on the first day.
551,00:35:16.42,00:35:16.42,"Maybe that would have helped, I don't know."
552,00:35:18.12,00:35:18.12,">> Sweet, sweet Bubba. >> Yeah, Bubba was awesome."
553,00:35:22.96,00:35:22.96,Me and Bubba planned to stick together to the end.

557,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,I'd be taking home to my children is knowing who I am
558,00:35:40.42,00:35:40.42,"now, that they know who their father is."
559,00:35:44.96,00:35:44.96,>> I made a comment that was totally blown out of
560,00:35:48.83,00:35:48.83,"proportion, and it cost me the game, but, you know, at least I"
561,00:35:51.71,00:35:51.71,"went out with my word, and that's what I said I'd do and I"
562,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,did it. >> I'd love to say I'd walk
563,00:35:59.92,00:35:59.92,"out of here with no regrets, but I'm a little bummed, I'd"
564,00:36:03.67,00:36:03.67,have to say. I never thought I'd get
565,00:36:05.79,00:36:05.79,"emotional in this game, but I'm a little fired up because I"
566,00:36:08.42,00:36:08.42,"really, really wanted to win this."
567,00:36:12.62,00:36:12.62,">> I don't have a single regret about being out here,"
568,00:36:16.08,00:36:16.08,because I played this game. I may not be a million dollars
569,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,"richer, but no one has enjoyed the experience of being on this"
570,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,land more than I have. Whoo!
571,00:36:30.71,00:36:30.71,">> Sarge, good old Sarge. He was definitely our..."
572,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,our chief. >> My downfall was that I
573,00:36:38.83,00:36:38.83,put trust in age over looking within each person individually
574,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,"and judging them on, you know, their actual character, because"
575,00:36:46.92,00:36:46.92,I saw some young people out here that had more character than
576,00:36:50.38,00:36:50.38,"some of the older, wise people that I looked up to back home."
577,00:36:57.29,00:36:57.29,">> I was doing some soul- searching, and I had to reach"
578,00:37:01.29,00:37:01.29,down and find some stuff within me that would allow me to be
579,00:37:05.12,00:37:05.12,"strong on my own, and it ran the gamut from suffering to joy--"
580,00:37:11.08,00:37:11.08,just the whole gamut of emotions.
581,00:37:12.88,00:37:12.88,"It was just amazing, so, yeah, I was able to find out, yeah, I'm"
582,00:37:15.50,00:37:15.50,a pretty strong guy. >> There are days when I
583,00:37:19.75,00:37:19.75,"thought: Why am I just not at home on my couch watching TV,"
584,00:37:24.62,00:37:24.62,eating chocolate cake? But it was so worth every minute
585,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,of it for me. >> Then there was Ami.

588,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,force. We were definitely a force to be
589,00:37:45.42,00:37:45.42,reckoned with. >> Jules.
590,00:37:51.21,00:37:51.21,>> Old Jules. >> The little sister I never
591,00:37:53.21,00:37:53.21,had. >> It's kind of a mental
592,00:37:56.88,00:37:56.88,battle to know what to expose and what not to.
593,00:37:59.96,00:37:59.96,"These people, some developed into friendships, but they are"
594,00:38:03.25,00:38:03.25,"also your competitors, but you have to keep persevering, and I"
595,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,"did at the end, and I feel good coming out of it."
596,00:38:10.25,00:38:10.25,>> What do we say about Eliza? >> What haven't we said
597,00:38:15.04,00:38:15.04,about Eliza? >> Looks to kill at Tribal
598,00:38:17.29,00:38:17.29,"Council, that's for sure. >> This was definitely the best"
599,00:38:20.54,00:38:20.54,"experience of my life. I mean, I don't think I could"
600,00:38:23.00,00:38:23.00,"have asked for anything more, well, except, you know, to make"
601,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,"it to the final two, but day 37 is nothing to be ashamed of, and"
602,00:38:30.50,00:38:30.50,"I loved the game, loved the competition, even the fights."
603,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,">> This is where the chief... >> Oh, my goodness... Wow..."
604,00:38:58.08,00:38:58.08,>> ...was buried alive. >> Whew!
605,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,>> The shells have definitely aged.
606,00:39:07.83,00:39:07.83,"Well, as they welcomed us to the islands, that ceremony the"
607,00:39:10.96,00:39:10.96,"opening night, they blessed us and gave us the opportunity to"
608,00:39:15.46,00:39:15.46,"have this as luck, and I'm going to let them have their spirit"
609,00:39:21.12,00:39:21.12,idol back. >> And we were also given
610,00:39:25.71,00:39:25.71,this chief staff and it looks to me like maybe there's a chief
611,00:39:30.62,00:39:30.62,"and a chieftess. I'm not sure how it goes, but"
612,00:39:33.67,00:39:33.67,I'll leave that scepter right there in honor of a man who
613,00:39:38.83,00:39:38.83,actually gave his life on behalf of peace.
614,00:39:41.71,00:39:41.71,">> Thanks for letting us stay on your island, keeping us safe."
615,00:39:46.50,00:39:46.50,I just want to offer this staff. >> The thing that I felt is
616,00:39:50.79,00:39:50.79,that I knew my feet were walking the trail that indigenous people
617,00:39:54.71,00:39:54.71,have walked for hundreds and hundreds of years.
618,00:39:57.54,00:39:57.54,I had a very special feeling of being part of a history that I
619,00:40:01.17,00:40:01.17,"didn't know about, but I had-- I have respect for."
620,00:40:06.58,00:40:06.58,>> To the chief. Thank you for letting us stay on
621,00:40:08.29,00:40:08.29,"your islands. >> Hey, hey."
622,00:40:09.75,00:40:09.75,>> To the chief. (Scout speaks foreign language)
623,00:40:31.33,00:40:31.33,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. All right."
624,00:40:44.46,00:40:44.46,You ready for your final immunity challenge?
625,00:40:46.17,00:40:46.17,">> Yes. >> PROBST: First things first,"
626,00:40:47.88,00:40:47.88,Chris. Give up immunity.
627,00:40:53.17,00:40:53.17,"For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
628,00:40:57.79,00:40:57.79,"For today's immunity challenge, you will use a bow and arrow."
629,00:41:02.25,00:41:02.25,You will strike the warrior pose.
630,00:41:05.17,00:41:05.17,You will bring it back to the ready position and a white paper
631,00:41:07.50,00:41:07.50,marker will fall down in front of your arrow.
632,00:41:10.21,00:41:10.21,"You want to hold this position for as long as you can endure,"
633,00:41:13.58,00:41:13.58,"because when the pain gets too much, you will release the"
634,00:41:16.21,00:41:16.21,tension and you will pierce the marker and you're out of the
635,00:41:19.96,00:41:19.96,"challenge. >> Oh, man."
636,00:41:21.62,00:41:21.62,">> PROBST: In addition, if at any time either of your"

639,00:41:28.62,00:41:28.62,guaranteed spot in the final two and a very big decision at
640,00:41:31.42,00:41:31.42,tonight's Tribal Council: Who will you choose to sit next to
641,00:41:35.21,00:41:35.21,"you at the final Tribal? Had a long paddle in, you had a"
642,00:41:39.42,00:41:39.42,"long walk through uneven terrain, let's see how much"
643,00:41:43.00,00:41:43.00,willpower you have left. You will be doing this barefoot.
644,00:41:46.04,00:41:46.04,Take off your shoes. We'll get started.
645,00:41:55.88,00:41:55.88,"Here we go. Three, two, one, pull them back,"
646,00:42:00.12,00:42:00.12,drop the marker. We are on.
647,00:42:16.67,00:42:16.67,Do not lose your concentration. Don't let your mind drift.
648,00:42:22.62,00:42:22.62,"There's very little play. You let go for a moment,"
649,00:42:27.46,00:42:27.46,"it's over. As if right on cue, the sun is"
650,00:42:39.25,00:42:39.25,"coming out, making a tough challenge even tougher."
651,00:42:46.46,00:42:46.46,"Fight through it, it's going to be tough in the beginning."
652,00:42:48.92,00:42:48.92,Get through that first stage. 38 days you've been out here.
653,00:43:01.75,00:43:01.75,Now is not the time to fall asleep.
654,00:43:13.21,00:43:13.21,Scout has pierced her marker. She's out of the challenge.
655,00:43:19.21,00:43:19.21,Take a seat on your platform. You're down to two: Chris
656,00:43:22.42,00:43:22.42,and Twila. Twila uneasy on the stumps.
657,00:43:28.58,00:43:28.58,>> Oh... >> PROBST: Twila with a
658,00:43:32.00,00:43:32.00,good save. Just about fell off.
659,00:44:12.83,00:44:12.83,">> You know the outcome, Twila. >> PROBST: And the deal-making"
660,00:44:16.04,00:44:16.04,"begins. >> It's as good as gold, Twila."
661,00:44:19.54,00:44:19.54,">> PROBST: Twila not responding. >> Talk to me, Twila."
662,00:44:22.92,00:44:22.92,">> Come on, Chris, give it up. You had it last time."
663,00:44:25.62,00:44:25.62,">> Hey, Twila, I proved to you two times in a row, man."
664,00:44:27.96,00:44:27.96,You're the one that turned your back on me at Lopevi.
665,00:44:30.17,00:44:30.17,>> I might fall off this thing and ram this thing through my
666,00:44:31.96,00:44:31.96,"ass, but I sure as hell ain't going to step down off this"
667,00:44:33.83,00:44:33.83,"pole. >> Hold your focus, Twila."
668,00:44:37.21,00:44:37.21,">> Scout's telling you to keep your focus, Twila."
669,00:44:40.29,00:44:40.29,">> It's all part of the game. >> Speaks volumes, especially"
670,00:44:43.92,00:44:43.92,"with Scout cheering you on, so I think I know where you're"
671,00:44:47.50,00:44:47.50,coming from. You'd better stay up there.
672,00:44:50.00,00:44:50.00,>> PROBST: Challenge is on. >> Challenge is on.
673,00:45:00.17,00:45:00.17,>> PROBST: How long do you think you guys have been up there?
674,00:45:02.42,00:45:02.42,">> I have no idea, but I'm sure you're going to tell me, right?"
675,00:45:05.50,00:45:05.50,>> PROBST: 55 minutes. >> Sweet.
676,00:45:12.58,00:45:12.58,"Scout, you dreaming about Twila winning?"
677,00:45:16.25,00:45:16.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Feeling it in your
678,00:45:32.83,00:45:32.83,forearms? >> Sure.
679,00:45:34.33,00:45:34.33,">> PROBST: How about you, Chris? >> No, it's too early."
680,00:45:36.67,00:45:36.67,"I'm not feeling nothing yet. >> PROBST: Buy that, Twila?"
681,00:45:38.83,00:45:38.83,">> No, not at all. >> PROBST: So, Chris, if there's"
682,00:45:41.12,00:45:41.12,"so much trust, why aren't you stepping off?"
683,00:45:43.12,00:45:43.12,>> Exactly. >> Because I want to win.
684,00:45:48.04,00:45:48.04,">> ""Because I want to win."" >> Damn, that heat feels good,"
685,00:45:58.12,00:45:58.12,doesn't it? >> Love it.
686,00:46:00.54,00:46:00.54,It's like being by the paver back home.
687,00:46:20.96,00:46:20.96,">> Gosh, dang it. >> PROBST: Twila, pierced your"
688,00:46:24.17,00:46:24.17,paper marker. Chris wins the final immunity.
689,00:46:38.58,00:46:38.58,">> God, yeah! >> PROBST: Chris... well-earned."
690,00:46:50.79,00:46:50.79,>> Yeah. Couldn't come at a better time.
691,00:46:53.12,00:46:53.12,"No, it couldn't. >> PROBST: Final immunity is"
692,00:46:55.08,00:46:55.08,yours. >> Final immunity is mine.
693,00:46:58.54,00:46:58.54,">> PROBST: So, tonight, Tribal Council-- one of these two is"
694,00:47:02.71,00:47:02.71,going to the final Tribal Council with you.
695,00:47:04.58,00:47:04.58,You have the afternoon to figure out who that is going to be.
696,00:47:06.75,00:47:06.75,>> Okay. >> PROBST: Good effort.
697,00:47:08.25,00:47:08.25,"Long day. Head back to camp, guys."
698,00:47:35.12,00:47:35.12,>> I pulled it off. I got immunity.
699,00:47:38.04,00:47:38.04,I'm still pretty shocked. Twila was some stiff competition
700,00:47:40.12,00:47:40.12,"in that challenge, but there was no way I was losing, no way I"
701,00:47:44.12,00:47:44.12,was losing. Long day.
702,00:47:46.67,00:47:46.67,>> Really long day. There's water.
703,00:47:49.42,00:47:49.42,I'll set it out for you guys. You can have all you want.
704,00:48:02.04,00:48:02.04,">> Chris and I, we had an agreement for the final two."
705,00:48:05.29,00:48:05.29,"If he won, he would take me; if I won, I'd take him."
706,00:48:09.50,00:48:09.50,"I don't know if he will now, because I feel like maybe he"
707,00:48:11.83,00:48:11.83,thinks I tried to hang into that challenge just so I could take
708,00:48:15.00,00:48:15.00,"Scout with me, but it's not true."
709,00:48:17.58,00:48:17.58,I wasn't trying to win it for Scout; I was trying to win it
710,00:48:19.38,00:48:19.38,"for me-- for me, my own self. >> At that challenge, Scout"
711,00:48:27.04,00:48:27.04,"cheered on Twila and said ""Hang in there."""
712,00:48:30.62,00:48:30.62,Scout was praying to the gods Twila won that immunity.
713,00:48:33.75,00:48:33.75,Scout wanted to go to the final two.
714,00:48:35.75,00:48:35.75,"I guarantee you, they had a pact, and if I find out they"
715,00:48:39.08,00:48:39.08,"did, Twila ain't necessarily going to the final two."
716,00:48:42.12,00:48:42.12,"I need you to be honest with me, Scout, because I'm going to tell"
717,00:48:44.04,00:48:44.04,you right now... >> Okay.
718,00:48:45.88,00:48:45.88,">> I don't know who I'm picking. >> Don't play me, Chris,"
719,00:48:49.54,00:48:49.54,"'cause I-I really just... >> I'm not playing you, but you"
720,00:48:52.00,00:48:52.00,need to be honest with me. >> Okay.
721,00:48:53.96,00:48:53.96,>> Because I feel like I've been played.
722,00:48:56.08,00:48:56.08,Did you and Twila have an agreement to go to the final two
723,00:48:59.92,00:48:59.92,together? >> No.
724,00:49:02.17,00:49:02.17,We had an agreement to go to the final four.
725,00:49:04.79,00:49:04.79,We had an agreement that we would take Liza out.
726,00:49:08.67,00:49:08.67,">> I'm startled. Twila told me the truth, and I"
727,00:49:12.33,00:49:12.33,didn't believe her. I figured that you two had an
728,00:49:15.21,00:49:15.21,agreement. >> No.
729,00:49:17.92,00:49:17.92,>> I couldn't believe how honest Scout was.
730,00:49:20.50,00:49:20.50,"Scout definitely is smart enough to realize why I was asking her,"
731,00:49:24.92,00:49:24.92,"""Did you and Twila have a pact to the final two?"""
732,00:49:27.42,00:49:27.42,"She could have very easily said, ""Yeah,"" and Twila would"
733,00:49:30.25,00:49:30.25,"have been packing tonight for sure, but she's honest, and I"
734,00:49:33.25,00:49:33.25,"respect her for that. Ah, that did it."
735,00:49:38.12,00:49:38.12,"The bottom line is, there's people on the jury that's going"
736,00:49:40.88,00:49:40.88,to base their vote on likability and there's players going to
737,00:49:43.29,00:49:43.29,base their vote on who played the best game and it's something
738,00:49:46.71,00:49:46.71,"I can't predict. >> Hey, Chris, one big hug."
739,00:49:52.33,00:49:52.33,>> I don't know if I'm gonna take Twila or Scout to the
740,00:49:54.25,00:49:54.25,"final two, I don't know. My decision could be made at"
741,00:49:57.54,00:49:57.54,Tribal Council tonight. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
742,00:50:25.38,00:50:25.38,"the members of our jury-- Sarge, Chad, Leann, Ami, Julie and"
743,00:50:31.08,00:50:31.08,"Eliza, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
744,00:50:41.25,00:50:41.25,Long day. >> Very.
745,00:50:43.04,00:50:43.04,>> Very long day. >> PROBST: And then you had your
746,00:50:45.67,00:50:45.67,"final immunity challenge with obviously a lot at stake, so"
747,00:50:49.25,00:50:49.25,"let's go through that. Chris, the minute Scout goes"
748,00:50:52.12,00:50:52.12,"down, you start talking, ""Let's make a deal."""
749,00:50:55.12,00:50:55.12,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Only the deal you
750,00:50:57.25,00:50:57.25,wanted to make was for Twila to step down.
751,00:50:58.88,00:50:58.88,">> It was the perfect deal for me, you know."
752,00:51:01.12,00:51:01.12,"If she steps down, then you know, we both get to rest, but"
753,00:51:03.92,00:51:03.92,Twila is very thick-skinned and doesn't give up and she fights
754,00:51:08.46,00:51:08.46,"to the end, and when Scout said, ""Hang in there,"" I didn't think"
755,00:51:11.71,00:51:11.71,"we were so good after Scout said that, so I wasn't about to step"
756,00:51:15.08,00:51:15.08,"down, and I don't blame her for not stepping down."
757,00:51:18.92,00:51:18.92,">> PROBST: So, this afternoon, you're a popular guy."
758,00:51:21.46,00:51:21.46,"You've got immunity, not a better spot to be tonight than"
759,00:51:24.04,00:51:24.04,the one you're sitting in. Did you get approached?
760,00:51:26.71,00:51:26.71,">> Um, actually, no, I did not get approached."
761,00:51:29.88,00:51:29.88,We went back to camp and they both understood that I was... I
762,00:51:34.25,00:51:34.25,"was holding the deck of cards and, you know, I was the only"
763,00:51:36.08,00:51:36.08,"one that was going to play and, you know, I've still got a"
764,00:51:39.58,00:51:39.58,"decision to make, so... >> I just feel extremely"
765,00:51:42.04,00:51:42.04,good about both of these people. There can't be a bad outcome in
766,00:51:44.88,00:51:44.88,this game. They are just amazing people.
767,00:51:47.33,00:51:47.33,">> PROBST: Twila, could there be a bad outcome for you tonight?"
768,00:51:51.38,00:51:51.38,>> Most definitely. I played the game hard.
769,00:51:55.00,00:51:55.00,I've wanted to win from day one. I've done everything I can to
770,00:51:59.08,00:51:59.08,"get where I'm at now, and I don't want to settle for third."
771,00:52:03.12,00:52:03.12,">> PROBST: Chris, when you hear the two different sides-- Scout"
772,00:52:06.46,00:52:06.46,"on one hand saying ""I'm happy, it's fine."""
773,00:52:10.21,00:52:10.21,"Twila saying ""I am not done""-- that obviously has to factor in"
774,00:52:13.12,00:52:13.12,"a little bit to you, because you're making a $900,000"
775,00:52:17.42,00:52:17.42,"decision tonight. >> Well, I listen to that"
776,00:52:21.71,00:52:21.71,and I respect the way Scout got to this point in the game.
777,00:52:24.83,00:52:24.83,"You know, Scout mentally played the game strong, and Scout was"
778,00:52:29.46,00:52:29.46,"willing to change the game, not only for her benefit, but for"
779,00:52:32.42,00:52:32.42,"other people's benefit, and I look at that and then I look at"
780,00:52:35.25,00:52:35.25,"Twila, and I see how aggressive Twila was in playing the game."
781,00:52:38.75,00:52:38.75,She did what she had to do to get to the final three-- whether
782,00:52:41.21,00:52:41.21,"it be lie, tell the truth, be loyal, break an alliance, it"
783,00:52:45.62,00:52:45.62,didn't matter-- and she admits that.
784,00:52:48.17,00:52:48.17,But I'm not going to look at how they played the game.
785,00:52:50.96,00:52:50.96,I'm looking at how I played the game and I've got to finish.
786,00:52:55.12,00:52:55.12,>> PROBST: Then let's get to the vote.
787,00:52:57.08,00:52:57.08,"You cannot vote for Chris. That means, Twila, you can only"
788,00:52:59.46,00:52:59.46,"vote for Scout; Scout, you can only vote for Twila."
789,00:53:02.04,00:53:02.04,Your votes cancel each other out.
790,00:53:04.04,00:53:04.04,"You won't vote. Chris, you'll cast the only vote"
791,00:53:06.83,00:53:06.83,and you will do two things simultaneously.
792,00:53:09.33,00:53:09.33,"You will vote out the 16th person from this game, and you"
793,00:53:11.83,00:53:11.83,will decide who's gonna sit next to you at the final Tribal
794,00:53:15.25,00:53:15.25,Council. You will in effect choose your
795,00:53:16.88,00:53:16.88,opponent. It is your vote.
796,00:53:20.04,00:53:20.04,Go make it. I'll go get the vote.
797,00:54:03.38,00:54:03.38,"Once the vote is read, the decision is final."
798,00:54:05.42,00:54:05.42,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
799,00:54:07.25,00:54:07.25,Council area immediately. I'll read the vote.
800,00:54:12.08,00:54:12.08,The 16th person voted out of Survivor: Vanuatu...
801,00:54:20.67,00:54:20.67,Scout. You need to bring me your torch.
802,00:54:35.00,00:54:35.00,"Scout, the tribe has spoken. You've gone as far as you can go"
803,00:54:51.46,00:54:51.46,in this game on your own. The power now shifts to these
804,00:54:55.17,00:54:55.17,"six jury members and Scout, who becomes tonight our seventh jury"
805,00:54:58.79,00:54:58.79,"member, now hold your fate in their hands."
806,00:55:01.92,00:55:01.92,We will reconvene for one final Tribal Council tomorrow night.
807,00:55:06.21,00:55:06.21,"In the meantime, you have one night left."
808,00:55:09.17,00:55:09.17,Enjoy it. You've earned it.
809,00:55:11.12,00:55:11.12,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
810,00:55:12.71,00:55:12.71,Good night. >> I feel really good
811,00:55:17.08,00:55:17.08,about how I played the game. I maintained the loyalty and
812,00:55:20.08,00:55:20.08,integrity as long as loyalty was there to embrace and when it
813,00:55:24.21,00:55:24.21,"wasn't, I embraced another alliance and was able to turn"
814,00:55:27.29,00:55:27.29,"the game around, make it a whole lot more exciting and fun, and I"
815,00:55:30.88,00:55:30.88,feel really good to have gotten this far and wish Chris and
816,00:55:34.17,00:55:34.17,Twila the very best. >> This is the last pot
817,00:56:05.21,00:56:05.21,of manioc I'll ever make. This is probably the last time
818,00:56:08.29,00:56:08.29,I'll ever eat manioc. >> With any hope.
819,00:56:11.17,00:56:11.17,This is day 39. This is it. I made it.
820,00:56:16.67,00:56:16.67,I turned things around in my favor and it paid off.
821,00:56:32.33,00:56:32.33,>> I am definitely feeling stress on a day that I
822,00:56:35.21,00:56:35.21,never imagined I would feel stress.
823,00:56:38.71,00:56:38.71,"I was ready to get up today and enjoy the entire day, and I"
824,00:56:42.17,00:56:42.17,"found myself thinking, ""I've got to keep playing the game."""
825,00:56:45.17,00:56:45.17,I've been thinking about Tribal tonight.
826,00:56:47.33,00:56:47.33,>> Yeah. >> I ain't gonna take no crap
827,00:56:49.33,00:56:49.33,"from any of them, are you? >> I'm going to try not to."
828,00:56:51.58,00:56:51.58,">> I mean, they're not going to run me in the ground because"
829,00:56:54.12,00:56:54.12,"I lasted longer than them. And I mean, I just know"
830,00:56:56.83,00:56:56.83,"how you are. Twila is extremely outspoken,"
831,00:56:59.79,00:56:59.79,and I can use that to my advantage tonight.
832,00:57:02.54,00:57:02.54,"I mean, I want them to remember exactly how Twila was: just a"
833,00:57:06.62,00:57:06.62,"cutthroat, didn't-take-no-crap kind of player."
834,00:57:09.75,00:57:09.75,I just think about some of the people on the jury taking their
835,00:57:13.29,00:57:13.29,disappointment out on us. >> They will.
836,00:57:14.67,00:57:14.67,>> I really don't know if I'm inclined to sit there and
837,00:57:18.00,00:57:18.00,"let them do that. I mean, I'll just sit and think,"
838,00:57:20.04,00:57:20.04,"""Well, I know Twila ain't gonna take no crap, so I'm not gonna"
839,00:57:22.54,00:57:22.54,"take no crap."" >> I'm not."
840,00:57:25.25,00:57:25.25,">> Great, Twila, you let them know you don't give a crap"
841,00:57:27.88,00:57:27.88,and that you come here to win. Chris isn't gonna do that.
842,00:57:31.42,00:57:31.42,Chris is gonna sit back and let Twila put the last nail in her
843,00:57:34.25,00:57:34.25,coffin. >> I'm a little apprehensive
844,00:57:50.71,00:57:50.71,about tonight. I honestly feel like I deserve
845,00:57:54.21,00:57:54.21,a million because I did play the the game the best.
846,00:57:57.62,00:57:57.62,I didn't suck up to anybody. I didn't pretend to be something
847,00:58:00.12,00:58:00.12,that I wasn't. Don't hold it against me because
848,00:58:03.79,00:58:03.79,I outwitted and outplayed you. I deserve their votes just as
849,00:58:07.67,00:58:07.67,much as Chris. >> I think I'm ready.
850,00:58:11.21,00:58:11.21,>> Back to reality reality. >> That's right.
851,00:58:15.71,00:58:15.71,"It's over with after tonight, okay?"
852,00:58:17.83,00:58:17.83,>> Yeah. >> No way is this party
853,00:58:21.42,00:58:21.42,coming to an end. >> Whoo.
854,00:58:27.08,00:58:27.08,"(Chris grunts, Twila laughs) >> What an ending."
855,00:58:31.33,00:58:31.33,>> (laughing): I haven't laughed that hard since
856,00:58:34.46,00:58:34.46,"I been here, I don't think. >> The closer Tribal Council"
857,00:58:37.83,00:58:37.83,"gets, the... absolutely the more concerned I'm getting."
858,00:58:41.42,00:58:41.42,"You know, in the back of my head, I just keep thinking"
859,00:58:43.08,00:58:43.08,"""that women's alliance,"" you know?"
860,00:58:46.08,00:58:46.08,"All of them might just say, ""Hey, look, the only way we"
861,00:58:48.67,00:58:48.67,can prove this women's alliance worked is for a woman to win
862,00:58:51.58,00:58:51.58,"this game."" And just out of spite, they can"
863,00:58:53.83,00:58:53.83,vote for Twila. >> Isn't it funny how I'm
864,00:58:58.08,00:58:58.08,actually going to probably miss this place?
865,00:58:59.88,00:58:59.88,">> It's been wild, ain't it? \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
866,00:59:17.04,00:59:17.04,(bird twittering) >> The sense of pride that I
867,00:59:26.12,00:59:26.12,"come out and played this game, when I get out of here, is"
868,00:59:29.46,00:59:29.46,gonna be with me for a lifetime. Everything that I will be able
869,00:59:34.21,00:59:34.21,"to take home with me: the memories, being by the ocean and"
870,00:59:38.12,00:59:38.12,"seeing things and doing things I've never seen and done before,"
871,00:59:40.88,00:59:40.88,it's been... it's been an amazing adventure.
872,00:59:50.38,00:59:50.38,">> It's kind of ironic, you know, at the Alinta camp"
873,00:59:53.46,00:59:53.46,when there was six women and just me.
874,00:59:55.54,00:59:55.54,"I wasn't in charge, I wasn't the chief."
875,00:59:58.42,00:59:58.42,"I wasn't making the calls, and that's the opposite of what this"
876,01:00:02.21,01:00:02.21,"place is all about, you know-- that's their heritage, that's"
877,01:00:05.00,01:00:05.00,what they believe in. And now it's down to me and a
878,01:00:08.04,01:00:08.04,"woman. If, unfortunately, I get second"
879,01:00:11.08,01:00:11.08,"place, being the last man in the game, that's an accomplishment"
880,01:00:14.08,01:00:14.08,in itself. I never dreamed I'd be... I'd
881,01:00:16.88,01:00:16.88,"be where I'm at, no way. And it's still hard,"
882,01:00:20.38,01:00:20.38,"you know, it doesn't quit. I guess it will quit when I walk"
883,01:00:23.83,01:00:23.83,off this island and it's completely over.
884,01:01:07.62,01:01:07.62,">> PROBST: We now bring in the members of the jury: Sarge,"
885,01:01:11.17,01:01:11.17,"Chad, Leann, Ami, Julie, Eliza and Scout, voted out at the last"
886,01:01:21.00,01:01:21.00,"Tribal Council. Chris, Twila, welcome to your"
887,01:01:29.04,01:01:29.04,final Tribal Council. One bit of business to do.
888,01:01:33.17,01:01:33.17,Immunity necklace. Immunity not back up for grabs.
889,01:01:44.12,01:01:44.12,"First, let me say congratulations."
890,01:01:46.21,01:01:46.21,You two have done what 16 other people were unable to do in this
891,01:01:51.25,01:01:51.25,"game: make it to the final two. But now, after 39 hard-fought"
892,01:01:56.46,01:01:56.46,"days, the game takes a twist. Your jury, made up of seven"
893,01:02:01.25,01:02:01.25,"people that you had a hand in voting out, now control your"
894,01:02:04.92,01:02:04.92,"fate in their hands, and based on tonight's final Tribal"
895,01:02:09.67,01:02:09.67,"Council, they will decide which of the two of you they think"
896,01:02:12.67,01:02:12.67,"is most deserving of the title of sole survivor, and more"
897,01:02:15.25,01:02:15.25,"importantly, the million-dollar check that goes along with that."
898,01:02:19.08,01:02:19.08,Tribal Council is where you are held accountable for your
899,01:02:23.08,01:02:23.08,actions. Expect to be held accountable
900,01:02:25.67,01:02:25.67,tonight. That's why we're here.
901,01:02:28.33,01:02:28.33,Here's how it's going to work. You two will get a chance to
902,01:02:31.50,01:02:31.50,make an opening statement. This is your first opportunity
903,01:02:34.04,01:02:34.04,to plead your case to the jury why do you deserve the title of
904,01:02:37.71,01:02:37.71,sole survivor and the million dollars.
905,01:02:39.58,01:02:39.58,The jury will then get their first chance to address you
906,01:02:42.54,01:02:42.54,since being voted out. Once the jury has asked you
907,01:02:45.29,01:02:45.29,"their questions, you will get one last opportunity to make a"
908,01:02:49.33,01:02:49.33,"closing statement, and then we will vote."
909,01:02:52.12,01:02:52.12,Clear? >> Yep.
910,01:02:53.75,01:02:53.75,">> Yes. >> PROBST: Chris, opening"
911,01:02:55.75,01:02:55.75,"statement to the jury. >> I think I, you know, I"
912,01:03:00.25,01:03:00.25,"think I deserve to win as sole survivor for, you know,"
913,01:03:03.50,01:03:03.50,many reasons. I think besides not only being
914,01:03:06.00,01:03:06.00,"loyal to the alliances that I made throughout the game, I"
915,01:03:09.21,01:03:09.21,think I'm the person that overcome more odds than anybody.
916,01:03:12.58,01:03:12.58,I was the last man standing with six women.
917,01:03:15.21,01:03:15.21,I just think I deserve to win this game because of the odds I
918,01:03:18.12,01:03:18.12,overcome. That's all.
919,01:03:24.08,01:03:24.08,>> PROBST: Twila. >> I came to this game with
920,01:03:28.71,01:03:28.71,"one goal, and that goal was to win a million dollars to better"
921,01:03:33.88,01:03:33.88,"my life and my son's. I played the game to win, I"
922,01:03:38.04,01:03:38.04,played it hard. I know I didn't do everything
923,01:03:41.42,01:03:41.42,that I should have done and should have done more in some
924,01:03:44.25,01:03:44.25,"other incidents, but it came from my soul."
925,01:03:46.25,01:03:46.25,"Everything I did was to win this million dollars, and that's why"
926,01:03:50.08,01:03:50.08,I believe I should be the sole survivor tonight.
927,01:03:53.29,01:03:53.29,I believe I've earned it. I worked hard for it.
928,01:03:57.21,01:03:57.21,That's all. >> PROBST: All right.
929,01:03:59.50,01:03:59.50,"Jury, in a moment, you're going to get your first opportunity to"
930,01:04:02.08,01:04:02.08,address Chris and Twila since you were voted out of the game.
931,01:04:06.25,01:04:06.25,Give you a minute to think about what you want to say.
932,01:04:32.12,01:04:32.12,">> PROBST: All right. Jury, it is now your chance to"
933,01:04:36.25,01:04:36.25,address Chris and Twila for the first time since you've been
934,01:04:40.08,01:04:40.08,"voted out of the game. Eliza, you're up."
935,01:04:47.50,01:04:47.50,">> Um, before I address my question to you, I have a"
936,01:04:50.21,01:04:50.21,"couple of comments. Twila, I'll start with you."
937,01:04:52.67,01:04:52.67,Congratulations. You achieved what you set
938,01:04:56.04,01:04:56.04,"out to do. You came into this game, saying"
939,01:04:58.17,01:04:58.17,"you would do whatever it took to get to the final two, and that"
940,01:05:01.17,01:05:01.17,"you did. You were a deceptive, lying"
941,01:05:04.79,01:05:04.79,bitch throughout this game. You never treated me with an
942,01:05:09.12,01:05:09.12,ounce of respect. You didn't even speak to me like
943,01:05:11.88,01:05:11.88,I deserved your breath. I might envy your position in
944,01:05:14.42,01:05:14.42,"the final two, but I do not envy your life."
945,01:05:17.17,01:05:17.17,"Now, with that being said, I do think you played a good game,"
946,01:05:22.12,01:05:22.12,"and you were outright about it. Chris, you, on the other hand,"
947,01:05:27.29,01:05:27.29,you shocked me. You shocked me.
948,01:05:29.50,01:05:29.50,"Whereas I knew Twila was going to be a deceptive, lying bitch,"
949,01:05:33.33,01:05:33.33,"I did not know that you were a deceptive lying bitch, too."
950,01:05:39.42,01:05:39.42,"You pretended to be my friend. I mean, you stabbed me in the"
951,01:05:42.21,01:05:42.21,back with the Julie thing and then you stabbed me in the back
952,01:05:44.62,01:05:44.62,"again and rubbed salt in the wound-- unnecessary, blatant"
953,01:05:49.08,01:05:49.08,lies! My request tonight from the two
954,01:05:52.04,01:05:52.04,"of you is, I would like an apology."
955,01:05:54.50,01:05:54.50,"Twila, you first. >> Eliza, I never talked to"
956,01:05:59.83,01:05:59.83,you with any disrespect when you respected me.
957,01:06:02.67,01:06:02.67,I never said any bad words to you until the latter part of
958,01:06:06.50,01:06:06.50,"this week, not at all. >> You're right."
959,01:06:09.17,01:06:09.17,You just said mean and hateful and spiteful things
960,01:06:11.04,01:06:11.04,"behind my back. >> All I said was, you talk"
961,01:06:13.29,01:06:13.29,"too damn much, and you do. >> That's a lie."
962,01:06:15.46,01:06:15.46,">> What else was I supposed to have said, Eliza?"
963,01:06:17.71,01:06:17.71,">> What? Oh, my God. Should I start listing things?"
964,01:06:20.46,01:06:20.46,>> I'd like to know. >> You said that I didn't
965,01:06:23.12,01:06:23.12,"deserve to be here, I was a spoiled brat, um, that I..."
966,01:06:25.33,01:06:25.33,>> But did I not tell you that to your face?
967,01:06:27.79,01:06:27.79,"And I did tell you how I felt. >> Is this, is this an apology?"
968,01:06:30.50,01:06:30.50,"I mean, if you don't feel that I deserve an apology, then fine,"
969,01:06:32.96,01:06:32.96,fine. >> I'm just getting to the
970,01:06:34.71,01:06:34.71,"point. You feel that I'm a lying,"
971,01:06:36.92,01:06:36.92,"deceptive bitch, well, I think you're a spoiled, rotten"
972,01:06:40.75,01:06:40.75,little child. And if you don't owe me an
973,01:06:43.21,01:06:43.21,"apology for how you feel about me, why should I apologize to"
974,01:06:46.38,01:06:46.38,you for the way you feel about me?
975,01:06:48.88,01:06:48.88,>> Okay. >> And I just don't feel like I
976,01:06:52.17,01:06:52.17,"owe you an apology, no, I don't. >> Okay. Chris?"
977,01:06:55.88,01:06:55.88,">> Eliza, when I made that pact with you standing there, I"
978,01:06:58.58,01:06:58.58,"didn't intend to do you wrong. I did it as strategy, and you're"
979,01:07:02.54,01:07:02.54,"right, I owe you an apology. I broke our pact and I am sorry."
980,01:07:07.25,01:07:07.25,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks, Eliza."
981,01:07:12.88,01:07:12.88,Julie. (Julie sniffles and sighs)
982,01:07:24.46,01:07:24.46,>> I thought I'd at least get one sentence out before I
983,01:07:26.79,01:07:26.79,"started to cry, but I'm feeling abnormally emotional"
984,01:07:29.92,01:07:29.92,"tonight, so... (sighs heavily)"
985,01:07:33.04,01:07:33.04,"Um, Twila, I saw all your tactics, antics and, I mean, I"
986,01:07:39.67,01:07:39.67,"tried to get you out of the game, like what, five, six"
987,01:07:42.12,01:07:42.12,times... My energy is directed towards
988,01:07:44.88,01:07:44.88,Chris tonight... >> Okay.
989,01:07:46.54,01:07:46.54,>> ...in the fact that I'm either voting for Chris or
990,01:07:48.96,01:07:48.96,"against Chris. So, I just want to let you know."
991,01:07:51.62,01:07:51.62,">> That's fine. >> (sniffling): Christopher,"
992,01:07:55.04,01:07:55.04,"um, you approached me as a friend and asked for help"
993,01:08:00.04,01:08:00.04,with everything to lose. I helped you as a friend with
994,01:08:04.08,01:08:04.08,"nothing to gain for myself, and you were the one person who I"
995,01:08:09.83,01:08:09.83,gave the opportunity to hurt my feelings.
996,01:08:14.38,01:08:14.38,Surprise. I'm here crying.
997,01:08:16.83,01:08:16.83,"Um, so I have two questions for you."
998,01:08:20.88,01:08:20.88,"First off, there are several occasions where I described our"
999,01:08:24.88,01:08:24.88,"relationship, brother-sister, and I don't understand why you"
1000,01:08:29.71,01:08:29.71,"had to doll it up that much, to look me so solidly in the"
1001,01:08:35.50,01:08:35.50,eyes and base things on our friendship and on things that I
1002,01:08:38.88,01:08:38.88,"felt were real. So, that's my first question."
1003,01:08:44.29,01:08:44.29,">> Julie, you are absolutely the hardest decision I made."
1004,01:08:51.42,01:08:51.42,">> Okay, great, like fabulous, but why the story?"
1005,01:08:55.38,01:08:55.38,It was so elaborate. >> Because at the time I
1006,01:08:58.58,01:08:58.58,"had no intentions of writing your name down; at the time,"
1007,01:09:02.42,01:09:02.42,my intentions were for me and you to stick together.
1008,01:09:07.21,01:09:07.21,"You looked out for me, you know, and I felt like it was my turn"
1009,01:09:11.00,01:09:11.00,to look out for you. >> It was.
1010,01:09:13.33,01:09:13.33,">> I lied to you, Julie, and, I mean, I can't take it back."
1011,01:09:17.04,01:09:17.04,>> Okay. Second question: When did you
1012,01:09:20.21,01:09:20.21,"start playing me? And I want the truth, because"
1013,01:09:22.58,01:09:22.58,this is it. I'm not set on who I'm
1014,01:09:24.38,01:09:24.38,"voting for. I'm pissed off at you, so tell"
1015,01:09:26.83,01:09:26.83,"me, what was authentic about our relationship and you?"
1016,01:09:32.12,01:09:32.12,">> I didn't play you, Julie. I lied to you and I let my heart"
1017,01:09:36.17,01:09:36.17,"get in the way, and at the end, I didn't even know if I was"
1018,01:09:40.00,01:09:40.00,"going to write your name down and decided at the booth, I"
1019,01:09:45.04,01:09:45.04,"just... I played the game. I did you wrong, Julie, and I'm"
1020,01:09:47.25,01:09:47.25,sorry I lied to you. If you disregard anything to do
1021,01:09:52.21,01:09:52.21,"with me, I understand, but I truly looked at you as a little"
1022,01:09:57.21,01:09:57.21,sister and... >> That's enough.
1023,01:10:01.04,01:10:01.04,That's okay. >> I'm sorry.
1024,01:10:04.54,01:10:04.54,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks, Julie."
1025,01:10:06.54,01:10:06.54,"(Julie sniffling) >> PROBST: Leann, you're next."
1026,01:10:15.33,01:10:15.33,>> Twila. >> Yes.
1027,01:10:17.96,01:10:17.96,>> One of the turning points in the game particularly for me was
1028,01:10:22.46,01:10:22.46,when you decided to turn your back on a four-person alliance
1029,01:10:26.88,01:10:26.88,"and vote me out, and on the day you decided to do that, you"
1030,01:10:31.21,01:10:31.21,"reinforced your loyalty to me, this time using the words,"
1031,01:10:35.54,01:10:35.54,"""I swear to you on my son's life that you have my word."""
1032,01:10:39.83,01:10:39.83,Could you explain to me your thought process in betraying my
1033,01:10:42.50,01:10:42.50,"trust in our alliance, and why I should reward you for it with"
1034,01:10:47.08,01:10:47.08,a million dollars? >> I felt that it was supposed
1035,01:10:51.00,01:10:51.00,"to be Leann, Ami, Scout and myself."
1036,01:10:53.29,01:10:53.29,I felt when you all turned your back on Scout and brought Julie
1037,01:10:58.21,01:10:58.21,"into the alliance, I felt that you could easily have turned"
1038,01:11:02.29,01:11:02.29,your back on me at any time. >> Even though I never
1039,01:11:05.29,01:11:05.29,did anything to... to make you doubt my trust?
1040,01:11:08.21,01:11:08.21,>> I didn't trust you all anymore after you brought Julie
1041,01:11:10.62,01:11:10.62,"in, I did not. I am sorry for that,"
1042,01:11:13.21,01:11:13.21,"because I did trust you. Ami, I never fully trust full"
1043,01:11:16.92,01:11:16.92,"wholeheartedly, but I did trust you."
1044,01:11:18.92,01:11:18.92,"But when you brought Julie into it, I felt like, you know,"
1045,01:11:22.21,01:11:22.21,it's gonna be you three and I'm the one that's going to be
1046,01:11:25.21,01:11:25.21,"sitting on the outside, and I couldn't do it."
1047,01:11:26.88,01:11:26.88,So I had to change the strategy and that's why I did what I did
1048,01:11:29.62,01:11:29.62,"in the end, not out of disrespect for you."
1049,01:11:32.54,01:11:32.54,>> Fair enough. Chris.
1050,01:11:35.67,01:11:35.67,"It's no secret that from day one, I was pretty much hard-core"
1051,01:11:40.17,01:11:40.17,"with the women's alliance, and my intention was to see that"
1052,01:11:44.75,01:11:44.75,"through to the end, no matter what."
1053,01:11:47.38,01:11:47.38,Convince me to abandon that way of thinking and vote for you
1054,01:11:51.29,01:11:51.29,"tonight. >> When we merged, I knew"
1055,01:11:55.08,01:11:55.08,"without a doubt, you know, my work was cut out for me."
1056,01:11:58.08,01:11:58.08,"If I wanted to stay in this game any longer, then I had to look"
1057,01:12:02.54,01:12:02.54,for an opening and a backdoor opened by who else?
1058,01:12:05.38,01:12:05.38,Twila come to me and offered me a chance to further myself in
1059,01:12:10.21,01:12:10.21,"the game, and I took advantage, you know, when the opportunity"
1060,01:12:14.54,01:12:14.54,"came. I just feel like I persevered,"
1061,01:12:17.17,01:12:17.17,"and I think that is the reason why, you know, I think I'm"
1062,01:12:20.21,01:12:20.21,deserving to win the game. >> Thanks.
1063,01:12:24.08,01:12:24.08,">> PROBST: Ami. >> Right now, I just see"
1064,01:12:32.08,01:12:32.08,"some serious irony in that. Twila, even though you had a"
1065,01:12:35.25,01:12:35.25,chance to totally and completely make an apology that maybe you
1066,01:12:40.62,01:12:40.62,"didn't believe in, for a million dollars you wouldn't do it, but"
1067,01:12:44.38,01:12:44.38,"you'd lie for a million dollars, you'd break friendships for a"
1068,01:12:47.12,01:12:47.12,"million dollars. You say, um, just didn't really"
1069,01:12:51.08,01:12:51.08,trust Ami. I don't know where that came
1070,01:12:53.75,01:12:53.75,"from, because you had 100% of my loyalty."
1071,01:12:57.50,01:12:57.50,"And, Chris, I'm still just baffled at why you took the"
1072,01:13:01.58,01:13:01.58,time to flat-out lie to two people for no reason.
1073,01:13:06.04,01:13:06.04,"I don't understand it. Chris, I want to know from you"
1074,01:13:10.08,01:13:10.08,first what attributes you think you have that put you in the
1075,01:13:15.54,01:13:15.54,"seat there, and that you think I don't have putting me standing"
1076,01:13:18.71,01:13:18.71,right here? >> I really don't see me having
1077,01:13:21.04,01:13:21.04,"any qualities any better than you when it comes to this game,"
1078,01:13:24.83,01:13:24.83,"I mean, absolutely not. I think that you're on the jury"
1079,01:13:27.79,01:13:27.79,because you have a soft heart. I think you're on the jury
1080,01:13:30.25,01:13:30.25,because I didn't give you a break.
1081,01:13:32.04,01:13:32.04,"You give me a break. You've let your guard down, you"
1082,01:13:35.62,01:13:35.62,"put personal feelings in front of the game, and, you know, it"
1083,01:13:40.17,01:13:40.17,was your demise. >> Thank you.
1084,01:13:42.50,01:13:42.50,"Twila, same question. >> First of all, I want"
1085,01:13:45.62,01:13:45.62,"to start out, if you don't mind, by apologizing to you and Leann"
1086,01:13:48.38,01:13:48.38,for swearing on my son's name. I should have never brought him
1087,01:13:52.08,01:13:52.08,"into it, I should never have done that."
1088,01:13:54.12,01:13:54.12,"I thought of the game and I thought, now, either they're"
1089,01:13:57.04,01:13:57.04,going to respect me for the decision that I've made to
1090,01:13:59.92,01:13:59.92,"further myself in the game and that's why I'm here, but now I'm"
1091,01:14:03.08,01:14:03.08,this low-life bitch that nobody likes and I don't understand
1092,01:14:05.17,01:14:05.17,"that. >> Twila, you flat-out lied"
1093,01:14:08.67,01:14:08.67,to us. You flat-out straight to our
1094,01:14:11.04,01:14:11.04,"face said, ""I'm your friend... >> I did."
1095,01:14:13.21,01:14:13.21,">> ""...I'm going to be here till the end."""
1096,01:14:14.38,01:14:14.38,That's what you did to both of us.
1097,01:14:15.92,01:14:15.92,>> That's not the way I see it. I feel like...
1098,01:14:18.12,01:14:18.12,>> I want to hear the answer to your question.
1099,01:14:20.83,01:14:20.83,Why are you sitting there and why am I standing there?
1100,01:14:23.75,01:14:23.75,">> Maybe a little bit more harder, a little bit more"
1101,01:14:25.71,01:14:25.71,"colder, maybe. You don't have it in you."
1102,01:14:30.54,01:14:30.54,And I have it. I wear it on my sleeve.
1103,01:14:33.79,01:14:33.79,It's not... I haven't tried to hide it from any of you all and
1104,01:14:36.88,01:14:36.88,"maybe that's why I'm here, and you're there."
1105,01:14:41.92,01:14:41.92,">> PROBST: Thanks, Ami. >> Mm-hmm."
1106,01:14:45.67,01:14:45.67,">> PROBST: Chad, you're up. >> Twila, I'll start with you."
1107,01:14:52.46,01:14:52.46,I want you to think about your experiences out here the past 39
1108,01:14:55.12,01:14:55.12,"days, and I want you to think about something that's"
1109,01:14:59.04,01:14:59.04,changed you. >> If you're talking about in a
1110,01:15:01.88,01:15:01.88,"bad sense, I need to watch what I say and how I come across to"
1111,01:15:05.79,01:15:05.79,"people, because I've always felt like I've had to defend myself"
1112,01:15:09.88,01:15:09.88,"all the time, so maybe I need to ease up, back off."
1113,01:15:13.17,01:15:13.17,"I'm a little hard and quick to judge sometimes, and that's not"
1114,01:15:16.04,01:15:16.04,"a good thing. >> Okay. Chris, same question."
1115,01:15:21.96,01:15:21.96,">> Without a doubt, the one thing that's changing me as"
1116,01:15:24.54,01:15:24.54,a person is experience in playing the game with the final
1117,01:15:28.12,01:15:28.12,nine people and seeing the genuine qualities people possess
1118,01:15:31.88,01:15:31.88,when there's a million dollars at stake and how those genuine
1119,01:15:36.17,01:15:36.17,qualities never falter. In the latter stages of the
1120,01:15:39.46,01:15:39.46,"game, I found that the money started talking."
1121,01:15:42.71,01:15:42.71,"I started looking at getting to the end no matter what, and I"
1122,01:15:45.88,01:15:45.88,feel like the two people that possessed the least amount of
1123,01:15:48.79,01:15:48.79,"those qualities are sitting right up here, and I look at the"
1124,01:15:52.75,01:15:52.75,seven people on the jury-- everybody sitting over there
1125,01:15:56.21,01:15:56.21,possesses a genuine quality that they look past the million
1126,01:15:59.46,01:15:59.46,"dollars, and that's something I didn't do, that's something I'll"
1127,01:16:02.96,01:16:02.96,take with me to try to become a better person.
1128,01:16:05.21,01:16:05.21,">> Okay. >> PROBST: Thanks, Chad."
1129,01:16:08.88,01:16:08.88,>> Thanks. >> PROBST: Sarge.
1130,01:16:13.88,01:16:13.88,">> Uh, basically, touch\xc3\xa9 to both of y'all."
1131,01:16:17.33,01:16:17.33,"You outwitted, you outplayed, you outlasted me."
1132,01:16:21.33,01:16:21.33,"I'll start with Twila. First and foremost, I hold"
1133,01:16:25.12,01:16:25.12,"myself true to my beliefs and my values-- loyalty, duty, respect"
1134,01:16:29.33,01:16:29.33,and honor-- and I only surround myself with that type of people.
1135,01:16:33.83,01:16:33.83,I wouldn't want to see you on a street.
1136,01:16:35.88,01:16:35.88,I wouldn't want a phone call. I would never want to see you
1137,01:16:38.17,01:16:38.17,"again, okay, but congratulations because you outplayed me."
1138,01:16:41.54,01:16:41.54,"Now, getting on to my question. After I sat here and listened,"
1139,01:16:46.04,01:16:46.04,"you need the million dollars, and I'm 99% sure right now,"
1140,01:16:48.79,01:16:48.79,"you're probably going to get my vote, okay, but I've got to"
1141,01:16:52.75,01:16:52.75,"know-- a million dollars, is that the price tag to cast your"
1142,01:16:55.21,01:16:55.21,son's name straight to hell? Is the price tag for casting
1143,01:16:58.71,01:16:58.71,his name to hell worth a million dollars?
1144,01:17:01.29,01:17:01.29,'Cause you say that you hope that your son forgives you.
1145,01:17:03.71,01:17:03.71,"If my mother did, I'd tell her to kiss my ass, okay?"
1146,01:17:06.21,01:17:06.21,"So, just tell me yes or no, is the price tag $1 million?"
1147,01:17:10.38,01:17:10.38,">> No. >> Okay, Chris."
1148,01:17:13.21,01:17:13.21,"Right now, she needs my help because she needs to buy back"
1149,01:17:17.17,01:17:17.17,"that doggone respect, so right now, you're probably not going"
1150,01:17:21.12,01:17:21.12,"to get my vote. What I need to know is, where"
1151,01:17:23.62,01:17:23.62,"does my friendship stand with you, and does it still stand"
1152,01:17:27.08,01:17:27.08,strong as it was before you found out that I wasn't going to
1153,01:17:30.25,01:17:30.25,give you a million dollars and will we be sitting at a race
1154,01:17:33.54,01:17:33.54,someday? >> There's not a price on
1155,01:17:34.96,01:17:34.96,our friendship. We developed a friendship from
1156,01:17:37.12,01:17:37.12,the time we met. We connected.
1157,01:17:38.25,01:17:38.25,I don't care if you vote for me or not.
1158,01:17:40.25,01:17:40.25,We'll be friends after this game.
1159,01:17:42.25,01:17:42.25,"Give your vote to Twila, I don't... We'll be friends"
1160,01:17:44.46,01:17:44.46,after this game. We'll sit in Charlotte and watch
1161,01:17:46.21,01:17:46.21,the race. That's a fact.
1162,01:17:48.08,01:17:48.08,You've got my word on it. >> Cool.
1163,01:17:51.17,01:17:51.17,">> PROBST: Scout. >> Twila, you and I formed an"
1164,01:17:57.88,01:17:57.88,"alliance the very first night. Chris, I've been with you 38"
1165,01:18:04.25,01:18:04.25,"days into this game, and I've been with you as each of these"
1166,01:18:08.29,01:18:08.29,"members came off, so I know your true response to each of these"
1167,01:18:12.58,01:18:12.58,"fallen comrades, and Twila, to your credit, you're not able to"
1168,01:18:18.58,01:18:18.58,"bull... very much, but I value the integrity of your ability to"
1169,01:18:24.17,01:18:24.17,still speak your truth even though it trips you up and gets
1170,01:18:26.58,01:18:26.58,you in trouble sometimes. You can't not be Twila.
1171,01:18:30.92,01:18:30.92,"And Chris, you are bull up to your ears!"
1172,01:18:37.04,01:18:37.04,(chuckles) I'm not sure where that takes
1173,01:18:40.04,01:18:40.04,you except that it sits you right where you are.
1174,01:18:43.00,01:18:43.00,Thanks for the 38-day ride. It was great.
1175,01:18:46.25,01:18:46.25,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks, Scout."
1176,01:18:50.25,01:18:50.25,"Thanks, jury. Well, Chris and Twila, you guys"
1177,01:18:54.25,01:18:54.25,have been through the wringer. Based on everything you've heard
1178,01:18:56.50,01:18:56.50,"tonight, you know where they're coming from."
1179,01:18:59.17,01:18:59.17,I'll give you a second to think about your last words to the
1180,01:19:02.67,01:19:02.67,jury. >> PROBST: Okay.
1181,01:19:25.29,01:19:25.29,"Twila, Chris, you've heard from the jury."
1182,01:19:28.79,01:19:28.79,The jury has definitely spoken tonight in very clear terms.
1183,01:19:32.79,01:19:32.79,You know what is on their mind. This is your last chance to
1184,01:19:35.54,01:19:35.54,"change a mind. Twila, you're first."
1185,01:19:42.25,01:19:42.25,>> I didn't come into this game intentionally wanting to deceive
1186,01:19:47.25,01:19:47.25,or to lie to anyone. I don't do that back home and
1187,01:19:50.62,01:19:50.62,anybody that knows me knows my word is good.
1188,01:19:53.96,01:19:53.96,"Whether you believe that or not, it is good."
1189,01:19:57.00,01:19:57.00,All I thought about since I've been here is bettering my life.
1190,01:20:01.75,01:20:01.75,That's all I've thought about and how I can do it.
1191,01:20:04.33,01:20:04.33,"I didn't worry about your feelings, I didn't worry about"
1192,01:20:07.04,01:20:07.04,"your feelings, none of you. That was selfish and self-"
1193,01:20:10.42,01:20:10.42,centered of me. People kill for less than what
1194,01:20:15.96,01:20:15.96,"we're playing for right now. Maybe that sounds hard or cold,"
1195,01:20:19.33,01:20:19.33,and it actually turned me into somebody I don't like.
1196,01:20:24.50,01:20:24.50,"Sarge, you don't have to rub it in."
1197,01:20:26.17,01:20:26.17,You don't have to make me feel any lower than what I already
1198,01:20:28.83,01:20:28.83,feel for doing what I did. You don't understand how that's
1199,01:20:35.12,01:20:35.12,bothered me. I highly respect you and to hear
1200,01:20:39.71,01:20:39.71,you say that just kills me. (voice breaking): I apologize
1201,01:20:47.17,01:20:47.17,to each and every one of you. It wasn't the game I intended
1202,01:20:51.75,01:20:51.75,to play. It was the game that ended up
1203,01:20:54.08,01:20:54.08,"playing me, and, uh... if I could do right again, I would,"
1204,01:21:00.04,01:21:00.04,"and for that I apologize. If you can forgive me, then"
1205,01:21:06.04,01:21:06.04,maybe I can forgive myself. That's all.
1206,01:21:11.54,01:21:11.54,">> PROBST: Chris. >> Scout, you called me out."
1207,01:21:17.62,01:21:17.62,I'm a bull... But you made me realize one
1208,01:21:20.38,01:21:20.38,thing. I can't bull... a bull...
1209,01:21:24.38,01:21:24.38,"Good point. Julie, alls that matters to me"
1210,01:21:32.62,01:21:32.62,"is, it ain't your vote, that's for damn sure."
1211,01:21:35.04,01:21:35.04,"I would just like to mend some fences, and I did you wrong, and"
1212,01:21:39.62,01:21:39.62,you still are like my little sister.
1213,01:21:44.92,01:21:44.92,"And I brought you your hat. Eliza, you are absolutely right,"
1214,01:21:53.71,01:21:53.71,I definitely owed you an apology.
1215,01:21:56.21,01:21:56.21,What happened with you and Julie makes me feel like I don't
1216,01:21:58.04,01:21:58.04,"deserve to be sitting here, that any one of you would"
1217,01:22:01.29,01:22:01.29,"probably deserve it more, and that's no bull..."
1218,01:22:04.92,01:22:04.92,"I truly feel that way, and I just want to tell you again"
1219,01:22:08.21,01:22:08.21,I'm sorry. 'Cause you give me your word and
1220,01:22:10.46,01:22:10.46,"there's no doubt in my mind, you'd be sitting right here if"
1221,01:22:14.17,01:22:14.17,it wasn't for me. I was your demise.
1222,01:22:19.17,01:22:19.17,"Ami and Leann, I came across an opportunity in the game and I"
1223,01:22:23.83,01:22:23.83,got to sneak in the backdoor because of the very person
1224,01:22:26.71,01:22:26.71,sitting to my left and because of Scout.
1225,01:22:29.17,01:22:29.17,They changed the alliance. They changed the course of the
1226,01:22:32.00,01:22:32.00,"game, and I took advantage of it."
1227,01:22:34.58,01:22:34.58,You're both sitting there because I did what I had to do
1228,01:22:38.00,01:22:38.00,"to benefit myself. Chad and Sarge, no matter how"
1229,01:22:42.71,01:22:42.71,"you vote tonight, I still made two dear friends, so just vote"
1230,01:22:46.54,01:22:46.54,"from your heart, you know, just feel good about who you vote"
1231,01:22:52.21,01:22:52.21,"for, that's all. >> PROBST: Okay."
1232,01:22:58.17,01:22:58.17,"It is time, finally, to get to the vote."
1233,01:23:01.17,01:23:01.17,It's a little different tonight. Tonight you are not voting
1234,01:23:04.12,01:23:04.12,somebody out of the game. You are voting for a winner.
1235,01:23:08.12,01:23:08.12,"Chris, Twila, you want to see your name on that parchment"
1236,01:23:11.12,01:23:11.12,tonight. It is time to vote.
1237,01:23:14.46,01:23:14.46,"Sarge, you're up. >> Psych."
1238,01:23:29.17,01:23:29.17,I had to know where our friendship stood.
1239,01:23:32.25,01:23:32.25,"You know where I stand: honor, integrity."
1240,01:23:37.12,01:23:37.12,"Good job. >> Twila, thank you for"
1241,01:23:51.96,01:23:51.96,"the experience of a strong, unspoken women's alliance."
1242,01:23:57.96,01:23:57.96,We took it to the end of the game.
1243,01:24:00.58,01:24:00.58,"I love you. >> Chris, you definitely"
1244,01:24:18.67,01:24:18.67,"screwed me over and you definitely hurt my feelings, but"
1245,01:24:22.00,01:24:22.00,"ultimately, I like you better. I just wish I was the one"
1246,01:24:25.12,01:24:25.12,sitting there next to you. I hope you win.
1247,01:24:42.29,01:24:42.29,">> (whispering): Twila, the fact that it comes down to"
1248,01:24:45.33,01:24:45.33,"the very end and in your answers, you didn't give any"
1249,01:24:49.08,01:24:49.08,crap answers. You really said it from your
1250,01:24:51.08,01:24:51.08,heart. You only said the things that
1251,01:24:53.58,01:24:53.58,you meant. >> PROBST: Okay.
1252,01:25:04.25,01:25:04.25,"For the last time, I'll go get the votes."
1253,01:25:23.67,01:25:23.67,"Well, I know it's been a long 39 days and a long, respectful, but"
1254,01:25:30.08,01:25:30.08,certainly emotional final Tribal Council.
1255,01:25:32.29,01:25:32.29,"I would love to read these tonight, but it's not gonna"
1256,01:25:36.08,01:25:36.08,happen. Going to have to wait till we
1257,01:25:38.29,01:25:38.29,get back to the U.S. I'll see you there.
1258,01:26:46.79,01:26:46.79,>> PROBST: This is where I get off.
1259,01:28:03.71,01:28:03.71,(applause and cheering) (cheering)
1260,01:28:57.62,01:28:57.62,">> PROBST: All right, let's do it."
1261,01:28:59.83,01:28:59.83,(cheering and applause) (applause continues)
1262,01:29:08.08,01:29:08.08,>> PROBST: I know you guys are ready to get to this.
1263,01:29:11.04,01:29:11.04,Nothing left to be said. Certainly put through the
1264,01:29:14.25,01:29:14.25,"wringer at the final Tribal, but fair to say you both had it"
1265,01:29:16.58,01:29:16.58,"coming, right? >> Right."
1266,01:29:19.17,01:29:19.17,>> PROBST: All right. Let's get to the vote.
1267,01:29:20.83,01:29:20.83,Tonight you want to see your name on that parchment.
1268,01:29:23.17,01:29:23.17,Tonight the jury voted for a winner.
1269,01:29:26.71,01:29:26.71,There are seven votes. You need four to win.
1270,01:29:30.21,01:29:30.21,I'll read the votes. First vote...
1271,01:29:35.17,01:29:35.17,Chris. (applause and cheering)
1272,01:29:43.08,01:29:43.08,Chris. Two votes Chris.
1273,01:29:48.00,01:29:48.00,(applause) Twila.
1274,01:29:51.38,01:29:51.38,"(applause and cheering) Two votes Chris, one vote Twila."
1275,01:29:58.96,01:29:58.96,Twila. We're tied.
1276,01:30:01.88,01:30:01.88,"Two votes Chris, two votes Twila."
1277,01:30:11.04,01:30:11.04,"Chris. Three votes Chris, two votes"
1278,01:30:14.38,01:30:14.38,"Twila. The winner of Survivor: Vanuatu,"
