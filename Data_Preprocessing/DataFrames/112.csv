1,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,   ANNOUNCER: 16 Americans marooned   for 39 days
2,00:00:04.97,00:00:04.97, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:06.93,00:00:06.93,"  Separated into two tribes--    Tagi and Pagong,"
4,00:00:10.87,00:00:10.87, they competed   against each other
5,00:00:12.50,00:00:12.50,  to remain on the island.
6,00:00:13.97,00:00:13.97,  But now the tribes  have merged into one.
7,00:00:15.93,00:00:15.93," Rattana is the name,"
8,00:00:17.80,00:00:17.80,  and it is everyone for themselves.
9,00:00:20.10,00:00:20.10,"  Every third night,"
10,00:00:21.60,00:00:21.60,  the entire tribe will hike  deep into the jungle
11,00:00:23.93,00:00:23.93," to take part in the Tribal Council,"
12,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,  where they must vote one  of their own off the island.
13,00:00:29.50,00:00:29.50,"  In the end, one will remain"
14,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,  and will leave the island    with $1 million in cash.
15,00:00:39.33,00:00:39.33, Last week on Survivor:
16,00:00:42.57,00:00:42.57,  The Tagi alliance threatened to crumble.
17,00:00:45.03,00:00:45.03,RICHARD: It seems like Kelly might be  flip-flopping
18,00:00:47.77,00:00:47.77, and planning strategies at our expense.
19,00:00:50.27,00:00:50.27, SUSAN:  When I turn around    and see somebody
20,00:00:51.93,00:00:51.93," starting to dig    a knife into my backside,"
21,00:00:53.57,00:00:53.57, it just really pisses me off.
22,00:00:56.00,00:00:56.00, JEFF: And island living was wearing    on the castaways.
23,00:00:58.80,00:00:58.80,COLLEEN:  It's not a fun game now.
24,00:01:01.60,00:01:01.60, JEFF:  Sean won a night   on a yacht
25,00:01:03.97,00:01:03.97, and a surprise visit  from his dad.
26,00:01:06.37,00:01:06.37,Dad!
27,00:01:07.73,00:01:07.73,  Kelly found herself  in hot water.
28,00:01:10.00,00:01:10.00,"RICHARD:  Kelly, on the other hand,   has no idea"
29,00:01:11.17,00:01:11.17,that she's leavingthis evening.
30,00:01:12.37,00:01:12.37, JEFF: But she saved herself
31,00:01:14.80,00:01:14.80,  by winning the immunity challenge.
32,00:01:16.10,00:01:16.10,"Instead, Colleen paid the price"
33,00:01:18.20,00:01:18.20,and was the final Pagong member   voted off.
34,00:01:20.10,00:01:20.10,  Only five from the original   Tagi Tribe remain.
35,00:01:22.73,00:01:22.73, It's anyone's guess who will  be voted off tonight.
36,00:01:25.93,00:01:25.93,  Captioning sponsored by CBSand SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
37,00:02:38.97,00:02:38.97,"RICHARD:Why are we leavingRattana, though?"
38,00:02:40.77,00:02:40.77,That's the stupidestthing I ever heard.
39,00:02:42.83,00:02:42.83, SUSAN: You think that   Rattana played on?
40,00:02:44.20,00:02:44.20,Yeah.
41,00:02:45.20,00:02:45.20,RICHARD:A bunch of individuals
42,00:02:46.63,00:02:46.63,playing a game.
43,00:02:47.67,00:02:47.67,Rattana was absolutelymeaningless.
44,00:02:49.10,00:02:49.10,SEAN:Rattana was meaningless.
45,00:02:50.23,00:02:50.23,"SUSAN:Yeah, Rattana wasmeaningless."
46,00:02:51.60,00:02:51.60,Tagi was... meant something.
47,00:02:52.60,00:02:52.60,RICHARD:Our name.
48,00:02:53.60,00:02:53.60,"Oh, yeah, especially"
49,00:02:54.63,00:02:54.63,when we were upagainst Pagong.
50,00:02:55.80,00:02:55.80,  There's no such thing as...
51,00:02:57.57,00:02:57.57,"  for me, a Tagi Tribe or a Rattana."
52,00:02:59.53,00:02:59.53,  That was the stupidest thing I ever heard.
53,00:03:02.10,00:03:02.10,   Or... or any other tribe.
54,00:03:03.53,00:03:03.53,  It never existed  and it doesn't exist.
55,00:03:06.10,00:03:06.10,"  It's a group of 16 people,"
56,00:03:08.27,00:03:08.27, four of whom were in   an alliance
57,00:03:09.63,00:03:09.63, with me   and a bunch of other ones.
58,00:03:11.30,00:03:11.30,And it meant something.
59,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,Now it's five individuals
60,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,just playing a gameand hanging out.
61,00:03:18.47,00:03:18.47,That's good.
62,00:03:23.20,00:03:23.20," SEAN:  Yeah, everyone's hunky-dory    and all friends,"
63,00:03:25.53,00:03:25.53, but they all come to me
64,00:03:26.87,00:03:26.87," and they say bad things about Richard,"
65,00:03:28.57,00:03:28.57," or they say bad things   about Rudy,"
66,00:03:29.57,00:03:29.57,and then they go to Rudy
67,00:03:31.00,00:03:31.00," and they say bad things    about me,"
68,00:03:32.00,00:03:32.00," and they go to Rich,"
69,00:03:33.63,00:03:33.63,  they say bad things    about Rudy and I.
70,00:03:36.00,00:03:36.00,"Sean's just... you know,talking to me all day about"
71,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,making sure I convincemy man-- Rudy--
72,00:03:41.60,00:03:41.60,to vote for Sue.
73,00:03:44.03,00:03:44.03, If somebody gave me their word
74,00:03:46.27,00:03:46.27," that they are in this alliancewith me,"
75,00:03:49.30,00:03:49.30,"  and I give my word,my word is good,"
76,00:03:51.93,00:03:51.93, and their word better be good.
77,00:03:54.57,00:03:54.57,"   If they betray me,I'll get even with them."
78,00:03:57.57,00:03:57.57,"Rudy talks about, ""Peoplegive me their word..."
79,00:03:59.60,00:03:59.60,"""I have friends."
80,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,"  ""I have friends back at home"
81,00:04:02.00,00:04:02.00," that take care of people like that."""
82,00:04:03.43,00:04:03.43,"Oh, man."
83,00:04:05.73,00:04:05.73,  I don't know   who I'm playing with here.
84,00:04:07.53,00:04:07.53,"I'm, like, ""Get me out of here. Send me home."""
85,00:04:09.80,00:04:09.80,Rudy'ssomething else.
86,00:04:11.00,00:04:11.00," RUDY: I mean, it's a game,"
87,00:04:12.83,00:04:12.83, but it's worth   a million dollars.
88,00:04:15.97,00:04:15.97,  Money talks.
89,00:04:17.07,00:04:17.07,You've pretty muchgot Rudy...
90,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,Yeah.
91,00:04:19.40,00:04:19.40,Yeah.
92,00:04:19.40,00:04:19.40,Under control.
93,00:04:20.90,00:04:20.90,  He always just looks   to me and goes...
94,00:04:22.40,00:04:22.40,"He goes,""Hey, who?"""
95,00:04:23.60,00:04:23.60,I don't care.Don't worry about it.
96,00:04:25.23,00:04:25.23,You have my wordand I gave it to you...
97,00:04:28.37,00:04:28.37,"  Rich is a smart guyand he's really tricky,"
98,00:04:31.27,00:04:31.27,"   and, uh, I don't trust himone bit."
99,00:04:33.20,00:04:33.20,  I never really have.
100,00:04:34.57,00:04:34.57, Whatever it takes to win here is the point.
101,00:04:38.40,00:04:38.40,"It's a game, and call it  Machiavellian, sure."
102,00:04:40.23,00:04:40.23,I'd much ratherit be Rudy left.
103,00:04:42.93,00:04:42.93,Than Sue.
104,00:04:44.50,00:04:44.50,"   'Cause then you and I are,you know, definitely..."
105,00:04:46.73,00:04:46.73,goingto the top.
106,00:04:48.20,00:04:48.20,So Kelly goes next.
107,00:04:50.17,00:04:50.17,"So it will now beyou, Sean, me and Sue."
108,00:04:53.97,00:04:53.97,I don't think you're anybetter off against anybody else.
109,00:04:56.77,00:04:56.77,"In other words, getting therewith anybody but me."
110,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60,"Hopefully, itwill be us three."
111,00:05:01.60,00:05:01.60, SEAN:  This is the most
112,00:05:03.27,00:05:03.27,  conniving bunch of people    I've ever met in my life.
113,00:05:05.43,00:05:05.43,  There's not an honest one  in the bunch.
114,00:05:08.50,00:05:08.50," Conniving, conniving,   conniving."
115,00:05:10.57,00:05:10.57, Things are falling apart here
116,00:05:15.53,00:05:15.53,   at Rattana Beach.
117,00:05:16.53,00:05:16.53,   ( voices arguing )
118,00:05:17.77,00:05:17.77,You told them youweren't aligned with us.
119,00:05:20.40,00:05:20.40,Colleen told me that.
120,00:05:21.73,00:05:21.73,That's bull ( blip ).
121,00:05:23.43,00:05:23.43,"I don't give a ( blip ),"
122,00:05:24.67,00:05:24.67,because I trust hermore than I trust you.
123,00:05:26.40,00:05:26.40,Why? That's bull ( blip ).
124,00:05:27.63,00:05:27.63,I've been your friendsince day one.
125,00:05:29.37,00:05:29.37,No. I'm going fishing.
126,00:05:30.37,00:05:30.37,That's bull ( blip ).
127,00:05:31.70,00:05:31.70,Will you talk to me?
128,00:05:33.00,00:05:33.00,No. I don't have to.
129,00:05:49.80,00:05:49.80,What did youjust ask Sue?
130,00:05:51.50,00:05:51.50,Sue feels that
131,00:05:53.23,00:05:53.23,I ( blip ) her...
132,00:05:54.40,00:05:54.40,or have ( blip )the four of us...
133,00:05:56.03,00:05:56.03,I don't understandwhat that's coming from.
134,00:05:57.93,00:05:57.93,Because... because I triedto make the Pagong team think
135,00:06:00.10,00:06:00.10,that we weren't goingto eliminate them one by one?
136,00:06:02.40,00:06:02.40,I thought thatwas part of the game.
137,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33, SUSAN: Kelly made all the rest of us  look like a bunch of idiots.
138,00:06:07.20,00:06:07.20,Then she made all the rest of us look like the bad guys
139,00:06:10.60,00:06:10.60,and her the one good guy  out of the whole five of us.
140,00:06:13.80,00:06:13.80,   That's what irritated me.
141,00:06:15.23,00:06:15.23,Sue doesn't haveall the facts.
142,00:06:16.60,00:06:16.60,Uh-huh.
143,00:06:17.70,00:06:17.70,I was trying to pretend
144,00:06:19.00,00:06:19.00, that we weren't going  to eliminate
145,00:06:20.37,00:06:20.37,"them one by one,  as I've said before,"
146,00:06:22.03,00:06:22.03, and I thought that was   part of the plan.
147,00:06:23.57,00:06:23.57,"We had saidwhen they come,"
148,00:06:24.73,00:06:24.73,"we're goingto split up,"
149,00:06:25.90,00:06:25.90,we're going to hangout with them.
150,00:06:27.53,00:06:27.53,  I wasn't trying to work them   for myself at all.
151,00:06:28.93,00:06:28.93,They all wanted to vote you off.
152,00:06:30.43,00:06:30.43,"They tried to come to meand say,"
153,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,"""Hey, we can be in the majority. We can vote Rich off."""
154,00:06:33.87,00:06:33.87,   I didn't.
155,00:06:34.93,00:06:34.93,I know.I think it was a smart decision.
156,00:06:36.57,00:06:36.57,Sue said many times thatshe wasn't part
157,00:06:38.67,00:06:38.67, of an alliance either.
158,00:06:40.20,00:06:40.20,"So, now all of a suddenI'm two-faced and I ( blip ) her"
159,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,"   when she had approached me   and said,"
160,00:06:44.43,00:06:44.43,"  ""Hey, Rich and I have formed  an alliance"
161,00:06:46.23,00:06:46.23,"  ""to vote you off at the end,"
162,00:06:47.53,00:06:47.53," ""but I'm not going to do that."
163,00:06:49.00,00:06:49.00," Let's you and I vote him off."""
164,00:06:50.47,00:06:50.47,If I was tryingto plot against you
165,00:06:52.33,00:06:52.33,and plot against Sue...
166,00:06:53.67,00:06:53.67,Uh-huh.
167,00:06:54.87,00:06:54.87,"...and trying to use themin my best interests,"
168,00:06:56.47,00:06:56.47,then I would havevoted for you.
169,00:06:57.93,00:06:57.93,But I decided...
170,00:06:57.93,00:06:57.93,"Yeah, I don't thinkthat's true."
171,00:06:59.27,00:06:59.27,...I wanted to stay trueto our... to our alliance--
172,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,to our four thatwe decided on fromthe beginning.
173,00:07:03.00,00:07:03.00,   Right. Right.
174,00:07:04.60,00:07:04.60,"   When Kelly said to me, um,   ""Are you pissed off at me?"
175,00:07:07.10,00:07:07.10,"It seems to me like you and Sue are pissed off at me."""
176,00:07:10.23,00:07:10.23," Well, that was my opportunity   to come in"
177,00:07:13.47,00:07:13.47,"   and smooth things,"
178,00:07:15.43,00:07:15.43,   as opposed to be the one   who upsets the applecart.
179,00:07:18.70,00:07:18.70,"Thanks, Kells Bells."
180,00:07:20.90,00:07:20.90, So certainly that little tiff  between Kelly and Sue
181,00:07:23.73,00:07:23.73, has been coming
182,00:07:25.17,00:07:25.17,"   and plays to my advantage,  absolutely."
183,00:07:55.53,00:07:55.53," Aw, it hurts."
184,00:07:57.60,00:07:57.60,  This is my second ray sting since I've been here.
185,00:08:00.13,00:08:00.13,"  Oh, and trust me, they hurt."
186,00:08:01.63,00:08:01.63,  It's like an aching sting
187,00:08:03.17,00:08:03.17,"  and it hurts from my knuckle  down to about here,"
188,00:08:06.07,00:08:06.07,  and it's constantly pounding  and it aches
189,00:08:08.57,00:08:08.57,and it hurts really bad.
190,00:08:11.67,00:08:11.67," I might act like a tough girl,   but they do hurt."
191,00:08:14.67,00:08:14.67, They gouge me.
192,00:08:15.67,00:08:15.67, This one got me good.
193,00:08:17.20,00:08:17.20,Notice the hand.
194,00:08:18.77,00:08:18.77, The knuckles are still swollen  from that ray bite.
195,00:08:22.80,00:08:22.80,I seen that tail come in  and just slice that.
196,00:08:25.67,00:08:25.67,"   Ow, was I pissed."
197,00:08:26.73,00:08:26.73,Cause he wasin a little hole.
198,00:08:27.73,00:08:27.73,He couldn't goanywhere but out.
199,00:08:29.07,00:08:29.07,"You know, he couldn'tgo back or forward."
200,00:08:30.63,00:08:30.63,He hadto come out.
201,00:08:32.27,00:08:32.27,KELLY:At least you getto eat the bastard.
202,00:08:53.20,00:08:53.20,RICHARD: Sixth day to the end.
203,00:08:54.97,00:08:54.97, Desperate to go home.
204,00:08:56.63,00:08:56.63, Really looking forward    to enter reality.
205,00:08:59.97,00:08:59.97," For me, this maintaining somekind of a thumb"
206,00:09:04.27,00:09:04.27,on ev... all of these different people's personalities
207,00:09:07.00,00:09:07.00," that I care very little about,   uh, is exhausting."
208,00:09:10.60,00:09:10.60,  I'm ready for the people
209,00:09:12.47,00:09:12.47," in my life that I've brought  into my life,"
210,00:09:14.93,00:09:14.93,  throughout my life.
211,00:09:16.27,00:09:16.27,And I'm looking forwardto getting back to that
212,00:09:18.87,00:09:18.87,   with a vengeance.
213,00:09:20.03,00:09:20.03, SEAN:  I've been wishing for home
214,00:09:22.37,00:09:22.37,   since the day I got here.
215,00:09:23.77,00:09:23.77,I haven't been away from  New York in this long ever.
216,00:09:26.20,00:09:26.20, I miss my favorite restaurant.
217,00:09:27.73,00:09:27.73,  I miss the people   at the restaurant.
218,00:09:28.73,00:09:28.73,  I miss my friends.
219,00:09:29.93,00:09:29.93,  I miss my family.
220,00:09:31.43,00:09:31.43,"  You know, I miss    all those things."
221,00:09:32.93,00:09:32.93,I'm just looking forward
222,00:09:34.17,00:09:34.17,to talking to my husband on the phone.
223,00:09:35.33,00:09:35.33, I can't wait for that.
224,00:09:36.53,00:09:36.53,"I get anywherewithin a phoneto make a call,"
225,00:09:38.43,00:09:38.43,"that's what I'm doing,is calling home."
226,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33,Uh-huh.
227,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33,I don't give a ( blip )what time of day it is there.
228,00:09:48.77,00:09:48.77,RICHARD: The end of days
229,00:09:50.60,00:09:50.60,  is what I'm thinking about as I lay here on a raft
230,00:09:53.67,00:09:53.67, in the middle of the  South China Sea on a beach--
231,00:09:56.83,00:09:56.83,  in my bed.
232,00:10:02.30,00:10:02.30," Yeah, it's very pretty."
233,00:10:05.10,00:10:05.10,"  It's a beautiful,    beautiful night."
234,00:10:06.53,00:10:06.53," Cloudy, but I like the clouds."
235,00:10:08.83,00:10:08.83,"I'm just looking at the clouds,"
236,00:10:11.13,00:10:11.13,thinking of going home.
237,00:10:13.03,00:10:13.03,   Waiting...
238,00:10:14.17,00:10:14.17,  waiting...
239,00:10:16.50,00:10:16.50, with no watch.
240,00:10:17.50,00:10:17.50,Having no idea what time it is.
241,00:10:19.50,00:10:19.50, Just knowing that time   is passing slowly.
242,00:10:52.43,00:10:52.43,Oh.
243,00:10:53.70,00:10:53.70,( laughing )
244,00:10:54.83,00:10:54.83,"   ""Dig in."""

246,00:10:57.70,00:10:57.70,That's mud fromthe mud volcano.
247,00:10:59.90,00:10:59.90,We got to dig in
248,00:11:01.13,00:11:01.13,to find the clue?
249,00:11:02.70,00:11:02.70,Yeah.
250,00:11:04.10,00:11:04.10,All it is is swamp mud.
251,00:11:05.60,00:11:05.60,I'm goingto rinse my hand off.
252,00:11:07.60,00:11:07.60,I think that's cool.
253,00:11:08.93,00:11:08.93,What?
254,00:11:09.93,00:11:09.93,The bucket and the mud.
255,00:11:11.43,00:11:11.43,We're going to haveto do some kind of digging.
256,00:11:22.60,00:11:22.60,"Oh, I found it."
257,00:11:24.40,00:11:24.40,"Oh, cool! Read it."
258,00:11:26.43,00:11:26.43,Read it to me.
259,00:11:27.43,00:11:27.43,"What's it say, Rudy?"

265,00:11:38.60,00:11:38.60,Another trip outof here would be nice.
266,00:11:41.70,00:11:41.70,That's good news.
267,00:11:43.27,00:11:43.27,It is.
268,00:11:48.50,00:11:48.50, JEFF:  It's Day 35 on the island
269,00:11:50.73,00:11:50.73,and old friends   are becoming new enemies.
270,00:11:55.10,00:11:55.10," So, for today's    reward challenge,"
271,00:11:57.93,00:11:57.93,  the tribe members will head   to the mud volcano
272,00:11:59.77,00:11:59.77," and, perhaps,   calm things down a little."
273,00:12:02.70,00:12:02.70,  This mud volcano actually   created the entire island.
274,00:12:06.40,00:12:06.40," Today,  the tribe members will engage"
275,00:12:09.07,00:12:09.07,  in some therapeutic  mud bathing.
276,00:12:11.27,00:12:11.27,"Okay, here'swhat I know."
277,00:12:13.03,00:12:13.03," A bit of a blowout yesterday,shouldn't be unexpected,"
278,00:12:17.37,00:12:17.37,  so the idea today is to have a different kind of a blowout.
279,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,   The goal is pretty simple:
280,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,get as much mud  from the mud volcano
281,00:12:26.50,00:12:26.50,"into your bucket  as you can in five minutes,"
282,00:12:30.07,00:12:30.07,using your body   as the transport vehicle.
283,00:12:33.23,00:12:33.23,  So you go over and lather up  as much as you can.
284,00:12:35.63,00:12:35.63,"You come back over here,shake off, squeeze out--"
285,00:12:38.47,00:12:38.47,   whatever you want.
286,00:12:40.07,00:12:40.07,"If that doesn't take the tension off,"
287,00:12:41.47,00:12:41.47,nothingtakes the edge off
288,00:12:44.07,00:12:44.07,"like a cold beer, right?"
289,00:12:46.17,00:12:46.17,"  So, for the winner,"
290,00:12:48.90,00:12:48.90, one Bud Light.
291,00:12:50.40,00:12:50.40,  That's a warm-up for what's going to happen later.
292,00:12:52.70,00:12:52.70,"Because, for the winner, later,"
293,00:12:54.63,00:12:54.63," you're going to be picked up,"
294,00:12:56.77,00:12:56.77,"  blindfolded,  boated to a mysterious bar,"
295,00:12:59.20,00:12:59.20,   where you and I are going to have a few more Bud Lights.
296,00:13:02.77,00:13:02.77,We're going to watchthe first five minutes
297,00:13:05.50,00:13:05.50,of episode one...
298,00:13:06.70,00:13:06.70,Wow!
299,00:13:07.70,00:13:07.70,...of Survivor.
300,00:13:09.17,00:13:09.17,  Wow!
301,00:13:10.17,00:13:10.17,I like that.
302,00:13:10.17,00:13:10.17,Cool?
303,00:13:11.63,00:13:11.63,SUSAN:Yeah.
304,00:13:11.63,00:13:11.63,That works for me.
305,00:13:13.20,00:13:13.20,"Okay, I'm goingto set my beer aside."
306,00:13:15.17,00:13:15.17,Let's get readyto do this thing.
307,00:13:19.73,00:13:19.73,Survivors ready...
308,00:13:21.40,00:13:21.40,Get muddy!
309,00:13:26.50,00:13:26.50,  ( whooping )
310,00:13:32.27,00:13:32.27,( laughing )
311,00:13:59.93,00:13:59.93, ( squishing )
312,00:14:37.60,00:14:37.60,"  Looking good, Rudy!"
313,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,Ten seconds!
314,00:14:52.03,00:14:52.03,Five...
315,00:14:53.10,00:14:53.10,four...
316,00:14:54.17,00:14:54.17,three...
317,00:14:55.23,00:14:55.23, two...
318,00:14:57.00,00:14:57.00,"Stop! Stop,stop, stop."
319,00:14:59.30,00:14:59.30,All right.
320,00:14:59.30,00:14:59.30,That was fun.
321,00:15:00.87,00:15:00.87,That was a blast.
322,00:15:02.57,00:15:02.57,   This is going to be close.
323,00:15:03.97,00:15:03.97,Wow.
324,00:15:03.97,00:15:03.97,"All right,we'll start on the end."
325,00:15:05.80,00:15:05.80,  Man!
326,00:15:08.17,00:15:08.17,Don't you haveto move over?
327,00:15:10.90,00:15:10.90,SUSAN:Stop bouncing.
328,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,"Oh, this is goingto be so close."
329,00:15:13.97,00:15:13.97,15.9 for Kelly.
330,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,That's notbad at all.
331,00:15:21.27,00:15:21.27,"Yeah, Rudy, I don'tthink you're as heavy."
332,00:15:23.07,00:15:23.07,No.
333,00:15:24.07,00:15:24.07,"No, that's notgoing to do it."
334,00:15:26.30,00:15:26.30,Right at about ten.
335,00:15:27.77,00:15:27.77,Need a littlemore coverage.
336,00:15:29.20,00:15:29.20,"Susan, you'vegot a big bucket."
337,00:15:32.30,00:15:32.30,   25 pounds.
338,00:15:33.30,00:15:33.30,15.9 is the number.
339,00:15:38.50,00:15:38.50,15.
340,00:15:40.00,00:15:40.00,"No. Aw, they get the heavy mud."
341,00:15:42.93,00:15:42.93,15.9 is the numberto beat.
342,00:15:44.93,00:15:44.93,This is Sean.
343,00:15:46.73,00:15:46.73,  Who's ahead?
344,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13, SEAN:   Sean-- 16.
345,00:15:49.33,00:15:49.33,Sean wasusing his hair.
346,00:15:53.50,00:15:53.50,Not goingto be enough.
347,00:15:55.57,00:15:55.57,"SUSAN:Wow, Kelly."
348,00:15:58.30,00:15:58.30,Wow!
349,00:15:59.97,00:15:59.97, One guy left.
350,00:16:01.53,00:16:01.53,15.9. I don't think
351,00:16:03.40,00:16:03.40,it's going to be enough.
352,00:16:05.07,00:16:05.07,  It looks like it's too easy   for you to carry.
353,00:16:06.63,00:16:06.63,I think I'm havinga beer with Kelly.
354,00:16:08.50,00:16:08.50,"Oh, you're out."
355,00:16:09.67,00:16:09.67,It's not even close.
356,00:16:11.03,00:16:11.03,  Wow!
357,00:16:12.03,00:16:12.03, Yeah!
358,00:16:13.43,00:16:13.43,Give you a big hug.
359,00:16:14.43,00:16:14.43,Give me a big hug.
360,00:16:40.93,00:16:40.93,  I wish I had a bigger chest   to carry the mud.
361,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,"I've been muddy,but not this kind."
362,00:16:45.20,00:16:45.20,"   It feels good to,you know, win something."
363,00:16:47.03,00:16:47.03,"I haven't won much of anything,"
364,00:16:48.90,00:16:48.90,  but I won yesterdayand I won today.
365,00:16:51.57,00:16:51.57,"   I'd feel better if it was an immunity that I won today,"
366,00:16:54.23,00:16:54.23,"but, hopefully,I'm on a winning streak."
367,00:17:11.40,00:17:11.40,"  Everybody was very pissy prior to the mud bath,"
368,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,myself included.
369,00:17:15.63,00:17:15.63, Things really  changed here today.
370,00:17:17.10,00:17:17.10,"  There was a fight,   for the first time"
371,00:17:18.67,00:17:18.67,"  between Kelly and Sue, but,   truthfully,"
372,00:17:20.77,00:17:20.77,  this little shenanigan game
373,00:17:22.93,00:17:22.93," at the mud bath thing    really paid off, I think."
374,00:17:25.27,00:17:25.27,And it did-- it rejuvenated us.
375,00:17:27.33,00:17:27.33,"I think it rekindled, you know, just, like, friendships"
376,00:17:29.83,00:17:29.83," and laughing,  and things like that."
377,00:17:31.67,00:17:31.67,"SUSAN: Yeah, the mud game was a blast."
378,00:17:34.77,00:17:34.77, I had a blast. Fun-- totally a lot of fun.
379,00:17:37.83,00:17:37.83," When we got back from the mud,   we were washing..."
380,00:17:40.03,00:17:40.03,   helping each otherget the mud off
381,00:17:41.23,00:17:41.23, and things like that.
382,00:17:42.57,00:17:42.57,"Let me clean my ears out,then you take it."
383,00:17:44.70,00:17:44.70,   RICHARD: It's bizarre to me
384,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,how people do the things   they do--
385,00:17:49.43,00:17:49.43, like how Sue and Kelly
386,00:17:51.07,00:17:51.07, are washing each other's back    and hair
387,00:17:52.73,00:17:52.73,"and, you know, laughing, joking"
388,00:17:54.83,00:17:54.83," and hugging,  and picking each other's zits"
389,00:17:56.70,00:17:56.70, and all the rest of it
390,00:17:58.10,00:17:58.10," right now, after what"
391,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33, they went through yesterday.
392,00:18:01.20,00:18:01.20,SUSAN:Doing the mud thing really wore
393,00:18:04.30,00:18:04.30,"   a lot of energy out of us,"
394,00:18:05.80,00:18:05.80, so it did key us down  quite a bit.
395,00:18:07.57,00:18:07.57,"And Kelly's the only other girl on the island with me,"
396,00:18:11.13,00:18:11.13, so we're going  to hang together to the end.
397,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77, This is my big getting-ready moment.
398,00:18:26.70,00:18:26.70,I hear a boat.
399,00:18:26.70,00:18:26.70,"I do, I hear the boat."
400,00:18:28.50,00:18:28.50,Here he comes--
401,00:18:30.33,00:18:30.33,the wondrous one.
402,00:18:31.97,00:18:31.97,"Bigger boat, girl."
403,00:18:33.67,00:18:33.67,They brought your limoto pick you up.
404,00:18:37.10,00:18:37.10,"Have fun on yournight out, kiddo."
405,00:18:39.40,00:18:39.40,   Have fun.   I hope there's...
406,00:18:41.13,00:18:41.13," Have a good one, kid."
407,00:18:42.77,00:18:42.77,See you later.
408,00:18:54.00,00:18:54.00," Bye, you guys."

414,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,"Can I get food, too?"
415,00:19:22.23,00:19:22.23," And food, yes."
416,00:19:23.73,00:19:23.73," Okay, hold on."

423,00:19:36.07,00:19:36.07,Typical.
424,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,This looks normal.
425,00:19:38.73,00:19:38.73,Uh-huh.
426,00:19:43.27,00:19:43.27,"   Okay, want a beer?"
427,00:19:45.03,00:19:45.03,  Yes.
428,00:19:46.10,00:19:46.10,  Can we get two Buds?

444,00:20:14.60,00:20:14.60, So how you hanging in?
445,00:20:16.43,00:20:16.43,I'm doing good.
446,00:20:17.90,00:20:17.90, Yeah?
447,00:20:19.17,00:20:19.17,"Yeah, the game's,um... you know,"
448,00:20:21.37,00:20:21.37,finallygotten weird.
449,00:20:22.90,00:20:22.90,It's finallygotten crazy.
450,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,Finallygotten intense.
451,00:20:26.03,00:20:26.03,Really?
452,00:20:27.40,00:20:27.40,"I thoughtI could trust Sue,"
453,00:20:28.60,00:20:28.60,which wasmy first mistake.
454,00:20:29.80,00:20:29.80,I guess you can'ttrust anybody.
455,00:20:31.10,00:20:31.10,I don't lose anyrespect for her
456,00:20:33.90,00:20:33.90,  for playing the game at all.
457,00:20:35.57,00:20:35.57," We're not... you know,"
458,00:20:36.90,00:20:36.90, I said something todayon the trail...
459,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,"  I was, like, wait a minute--we're not evil."
460,00:20:41.63,00:20:41.63, We just play bad people on TV.
461,00:20:43.57,00:20:43.57,Whether it's everyman for himself
462,00:20:45.47,00:20:45.47," or whatever, I would like to, uh..."
463,00:20:47.70,00:20:47.70,"  smooth things over with Sue,"
464,00:20:49.47,00:20:49.47, because that was just completely... there was no...
465,00:20:52.97,00:20:52.97,  It'll be interesting   to see how this plays out.
466,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,I know.
467,00:21:09.93,00:21:09.93,JEFF:I have a very special friend
468,00:21:11.93,00:21:11.93, that I was going to show her  something on the TV.
469,00:21:14.43,00:21:14.43, Is that okay?
470,00:21:16.03,00:21:16.03,Okay.
471,00:21:16.03,00:21:16.03,Yeah.
472,00:21:17.40,00:21:17.40, ( patrons applauding )
473,00:21:20.87,00:21:20.87,   All right.
474,00:21:24.20,00:21:24.20,  ( patrons cheering )
475,00:21:26.03,00:21:26.03,  How many do I need?
476,00:21:29.10,00:21:29.10,Where's our box?
477,00:21:30.70,00:21:30.70, Where's the Tagi box?
478,00:21:32.87,00:21:32.87, JEFF:   You are witnessing
479,00:21:34.93,00:21:34.93,   16 Americans begin an adventure that will forever
480,00:21:38.53,00:21:38.53,  change their lives.
481,00:21:39.73,00:21:39.73, They've been given two minutes
482,00:21:41.10,00:21:41.10,  to salvage whatever they can
483,00:21:42.33,00:21:42.33, off this boat.
484,00:21:44.53,00:21:44.53,"Yeah, go, Jenna!"
485,00:21:46.27,00:21:46.27,That was awesome.
486,00:21:47.77,00:21:47.77,That was so cool.
487,00:21:49.47,00:21:49.47,"The Tagi Tribe,  who will always wear orange,"
488,00:21:52.23,00:21:52.23,"consists of Rudy Boesch,  a retired Navy SEAL,"

492,00:22:04.00,00:22:04.00,"Oh, my God!"
493,00:22:12.73,00:22:12.73,  Good night.
494,00:22:14.07,00:22:14.07,  I'll see you later.
495,00:22:36.70,00:22:36.70,  RICHARD:Today is the fourth day
496,00:22:38.70,00:22:38.70, till the end of competition--
497,00:22:41.73,00:22:41.73,  the 36th day of our game.
498,00:22:43.57,00:22:43.57,  I've said it 14 times today
499,00:22:45.47,00:22:45.47,  and I still can't keep it   in my head.
500,00:22:47.60,00:22:47.60,Let's keep itfun around here
501,00:22:49.07,00:22:49.07,"for the next,you know..."
502,00:22:50.43,00:22:50.43,Keep it fun?
503,00:22:50.43,00:22:50.43,Yeah.
504,00:22:51.43,00:22:51.43,It's going
505,00:22:52.43,00:22:52.43,"to be tough,emotion-wise"
506,00:22:53.97,00:22:53.97,between Sue and Kelly.
507,00:22:55.40,00:22:55.40,"And Kelly, I think,is going to be"
508,00:22:57.60,00:22:57.60,a little sadder.
509,00:22:59.10,00:22:59.10,"She's sitting overthere with her,so that's good."
510,00:23:01.13,00:23:01.13,I'm waitingto manage conflict.
511,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,"   Well, you got one."
512,00:23:04.30,00:23:04.30,I've cometo a conclusion.
513,00:23:06.63,00:23:06.63,"I align with my family,who I love dearly and..."
514,00:23:10.53,00:23:10.53,"There is four days left,  and we're all going to have   to live together."
515,00:23:13.23,00:23:13.23," And Sue and I,  we kind of patched things up"
516,00:23:15.43,00:23:15.43," and she said,   ""Hey, look, this is a game."
517,00:23:17.63,00:23:17.63,"  ""I'm going to have  an alliance with Rich"
518,00:23:19.77,00:23:19.77,"  instead of you."""
519,00:23:21.10,00:23:21.10,"  I said, ""Fine. That's cool. Play the game."""
520,00:23:22.97,00:23:22.97,If you feel thatyou need toalign with Rich
521,00:23:25.10,00:23:25.10,to get youas far as you can...
522,00:23:26.43,00:23:26.43,That's what I'm saying.
523,00:23:27.77,00:23:27.77,And you'replaying the game
524,00:23:29.60,00:23:29.60,"and, you know,I respect that,"
525,00:23:31.60,00:23:31.60,"but I didn't,you know,"
526,00:23:33.23,00:23:33.23,you were telling meI was two-faced
527,00:23:34.73,00:23:34.73,"and telling methat I, you know,"
528,00:23:36.10,00:23:36.10,betrayed youor whatever
529,00:23:37.57,00:23:37.57,and I don't feelthat I have at all.
530,00:23:39.07,00:23:39.07,"  I said, ""I think I deserve   to get to the four"
531,00:23:41.23,00:23:41.23,"  and to get to the three."""
532,00:23:42.77,00:23:42.77,"  She said,   ""I'm not going to let you."""
533,00:23:44.53,00:23:44.53,And it's the other way around--    I'm not going to let her.
534,00:23:46.87,00:23:46.87,I feel that Ishould maybe
535,00:23:48.13,00:23:48.13,deserve to getinto the three
536,00:23:49.70,00:23:49.70,and then you guyshave at it.
537,00:23:50.97,00:23:50.97,"Well, whatever, yeah,but, no, I ain't going"
538,00:23:53.17,00:23:53.17,to let youinto the three
539,00:23:54.40,00:23:54.40,"if I canpossibly help it,"
540,00:23:55.63,00:23:55.63,'cause you're a threatto me in the end.
541,00:23:57.50,00:23:57.50,   We'll keep to an agreement
542,00:23:59.00,00:23:59.00,that we'll treateach other civil
543,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,  till the time we leave here.
544,00:24:02.60,00:24:02.60,No sense to make it hard  on anybody.
545,00:24:04.63,00:24:04.63,"And while we're here,possibly together forthe next four days..."
546,00:24:07.77,00:24:07.77,so let'sjust be civil.
547,00:24:09.00,00:24:09.00,I know. That'swhat I thought
548,00:24:10.27,00:24:10.27,we were being--very civil.
549,00:24:11.50,00:24:11.50,"I thoughtwe were, too."
550,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,  I just wanted to...   to clear that up.
551,00:24:15.33,00:24:15.33,I felt that yesterdaywas a confusing thing
552,00:24:18.33,00:24:18.33," and, you know, whatever happens now, happens."
553,00:24:21.33,00:24:21.33,That's right. Yeah.
554,00:24:30.70,00:24:30.70,RICHARD:Check that out.
555,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,Look at the road
556,00:24:33.10,00:24:33.10,"the ant highway, up on the, uh, ceiling"
557,00:24:35.37,00:24:35.37," of the, uh, hut here."
558,00:24:36.80,00:24:36.80,  The canvas.
559,00:24:37.97,00:24:37.97,   Two-lane highway.
560,00:24:39.40,00:24:39.40,  You can see the ants   going in and out.
561,00:24:41.03,00:24:41.03,  Got a really great view from here.
562,00:24:43.20,00:24:43.20, We'll build the grill   when we get back.
563,00:24:45.93,00:24:45.93,   This is my  mosquito net sarong.
564,00:24:47.77,00:24:47.77,  This is... damn it.
565,00:24:49.00,00:24:49.00,Really it's three days.
566,00:24:51.00,00:24:51.00,"Right, this is thefourth day to the end."
567,00:24:54.17,00:24:54.17,"In three days, this'll be over."
568,00:24:56.13,00:24:56.13," All I'm thinking now is ""win."""
569,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40, Do what I have to do.
570,00:24:59.90,00:24:59.90,"Now I'm in it to win, you know,"
571,00:25:01.87,00:25:01.87,and to just... justbe a nice guy
572,00:25:04.47,00:25:04.47,"  and to just do this,that and the other thing"
573,00:25:06.20,00:25:06.20,and pack it in is wrong.
574,00:25:07.33,00:25:07.33,  So I got to win.
575,00:25:09.37,00:25:09.37,   I'm going to haveto win immunity
576,00:25:10.83,00:25:10.83,   and I'll have to finagle.
577,00:25:12.13,00:25:12.13, And I'm  going to have to try
578,00:25:13.37,00:25:13.37, to pick up the vibe on people.
579,00:25:14.77,00:25:14.77," If, you know, like right now,"
580,00:25:16.23,00:25:16.23, Sue and Kelly  aren't getting along.
581,00:25:17.80,00:25:17.80,  There might be something I can exploit to my advantage.
582,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,   I might have to dostuff like that.
583,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,"It's going to be a lot of work,  but I'll get there."
584,00:25:25.47,00:25:25.47," SUSAN: Yeah, I have one more   challenge."
585,00:25:28.00,00:25:28.00,"  There's no rewards,  and you know what?"
586,00:25:29.83,00:25:29.83, I'm not even thinking   I'm going to win anymore.
587,00:25:32.03,00:25:32.03,"  I want to win the last one,  like, oh, man, if I win any--"
588,00:25:34.60,00:25:34.60,"  I'm praying, I'm praying"
589,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,  that I win    the very last immunity--
590,00:25:37.50,00:25:37.50,"  if I'm here, if I make it through the next four,"
591,00:25:39.83,00:25:39.83, which I think I will.
592,00:25:41.00,00:25:41.00,"Oh, the mailboxis getting further away."

617,00:26:42.00,00:26:42.00,It's tonight at PagongBeach at sundown.
618,00:26:44.07,00:26:44.07,"That's prettycool, though."
619,00:26:53.47,00:26:53.47, JEFF:  This island is Rich with   tradition and superstition.
620,00:26:57.20,00:26:57.20,"  Talk to the locals,  they'll tell you one thing--"
621,00:27:00.67,00:27:00.67," disrespect the jungle,   you pay the price."
622,00:27:03.47,00:27:03.47,Today's challenge deals  with jungle spirits.
623,00:27:06.10,00:27:06.10, Each survivor will be given a video camera
624,00:27:08.67,00:27:08.67, and will race into the jungle    in search of five masks.
625,00:27:11.60,00:27:11.60, Behind each one is a question about island folklore.
626,00:27:14.67,00:27:14.67, The castaways   will use the camera
627,00:27:16.40,00:27:16.40,to record themselves giving theanswers and then take the mask.
628,00:27:20.07,00:27:20.07, The first one    to collect all the masks
629,00:27:22.23,00:27:22.23,  and answer all five   questions correctly on tape
630,00:27:25.53,00:27:25.53,will appease the jungle spirits    and win immunity.
631,00:27:31.20,00:27:31.20,  Everything I'm about  to tell you is true.
632,00:27:33.27,00:27:33.27,Malaysian custom saysthat sacrificing a goat
633,00:27:36.07,00:27:36.07,can bring about good luck.
634,00:27:37.60,00:27:37.60, So the locals seek out
635,00:27:38.97,00:27:38.97, the largest Banyan tree  they can find
636,00:27:41.07,00:27:41.07,and a high priestessmakes the sacrifice.
637,00:27:46.80,00:27:46.80,This is how you protectyourself in the jungle.
638,00:27:49.23,00:27:49.23,The one thing you want to doto protect yourself is
639,00:27:50.83,00:27:50.83,never call outsomebody's name.
640,00:27:52.53,00:27:52.53,"According to legend,"
641,00:27:53.87,00:27:53.87,"if you call out someone's name,the tree spirits"
642,00:27:56.07,00:27:56.07,Ncan grab that name andliterally repeat that name later.
643,00:27:59.03,00:27:59.03,  So you're out on your own
644,00:28:00.73,00:28:00.73,"  and you hear somebody say  your name-- ""I'm over here."""
645,00:28:03.50,00:28:03.50, So you start going this way.
646,00:28:05.20,00:28:05.20,So what you have to doif this happens--
647,00:28:06.77,00:28:06.77,"you got a piece of vine,  you make a circle out of it,"
648,00:28:09.40,00:28:09.40,"  you step through the circle,"
649,00:28:10.80,00:28:10.80,you sayyour own name
650,00:28:12.23,00:28:12.23,and you reclaimyour name.
651,00:28:18.40,00:28:18.40," Every Tribal Council  I say, ""Fire represents life."
652,00:28:22.03,00:28:22.03,"  Your identity is   represented by your fire."""
653,00:28:24.87,00:28:24.87,"Since the merger, every personvoted off the island"
654,00:28:27.13,00:28:27.13,has had their torch mysteriouslyblown out by the wind.
655,00:28:30.93,00:28:30.93,"And without anyone noticing,"
656,00:28:32.87,00:28:32.87,we had to re-light itso it could be
657,00:28:35.37,00:28:35.37,ceremoniouslysnuffed out instead.
658,00:28:39.40,00:28:39.40,"Also at Tribal Council,"
659,00:28:41.20,00:28:41.20,   I started blowing   this conch shell.
660,00:28:43.07,00:28:43.07,"Okay. Folklore saysthat the headhunters,when they would"
661,00:28:46.03,00:28:46.03,"come back fromtheir headhunting,"
662,00:28:47.53,00:28:47.53,they would blow the conch shell
663,00:28:49.23,00:28:49.23,  and the rain gods  would release a storm
664,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17, to cleanse them    of all their sins
665,00:28:52.53,00:28:52.53,that they had committed for thepeople that they had beheaded.
666,00:28:55.53,00:28:55.53,What has happenedat every Tribal Council?
667,00:28:57.53,00:28:57.53,It's rained.
668,00:29:01.73,00:29:01.73,The last thing is probablythe most beautiful thing
669,00:29:04.60,00:29:04.60,"about island life,involves snakes."
670,00:29:06.47,00:29:06.47,The truth isthat when a snake
671,00:29:08.13,00:29:08.13,"   comes to your camp, it isactually bringing you good luck."
672,00:29:11.07,00:29:11.07," If you treat the snake with respect,"
673,00:29:12.80,00:29:12.80,"  it will bring you good luck, but if you disrespect"
674,00:29:15.27,00:29:15.27,"or taunt a snake,it'll bring you bad luck."
675,00:29:18.97,00:29:18.97,Joel canattest to that.
676,00:29:21.00,00:29:21.00," He chased a pit viper   away from the Pagong camp,"
677,00:29:23.33,00:29:23.33, his fate was sealed.
678,00:29:24.40,00:29:24.40,  Later that night
679,00:29:25.40,00:29:25.40, Joel was voted off the island.
680,00:29:26.93,00:29:26.93,The most importantthing right now is
681,00:29:29.10,00:29:29.10,"if you have listenedcarefully,"
682,00:29:31.00,00:29:31.00,I've given you everythingyou need to know
683,00:29:32.90,00:29:32.90,to win tonight'simmunity challenge.
684,00:29:34.80,00:29:34.80,Take a camera
685,00:29:36.90,00:29:36.90,   and pass it down.
686,00:29:38.40,00:29:38.40,Your immunity challengetonight is to go into the jungle
687,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,and thereyou'll find
688,00:29:42.13,00:29:42.13,five masksfor each one of you.
689,00:29:43.83,00:29:43.83,Behind each maskis a question.
690,00:29:45.87,00:29:45.87,"Take the video camera,point it at yourself,"
691,00:29:47.93,00:29:47.93,record the answer.
692,00:29:49.53,00:29:49.53," When you're finished,take the mask with you."
693,00:29:52.03,00:29:52.03,  First one back with all the correct answers wins immunity.
694,00:29:55.13,00:29:55.13,  Let's do it.
695,00:30:01.57,00:30:01.57,This is for immunity.
696,00:30:03.30,00:30:03.30,"Win this, you're goingto the final four."
697,00:30:08.67,00:30:08.67,Survivors ready?
698,00:30:10.20,00:30:10.20,Go!

704,00:30:44.57,00:30:44.57,"Don't taunt it, don't do  anything to it. That's one."
705,00:30:56.33,00:30:56.33, I don't know.
706,00:30:58.43,00:30:58.43,"""What will the sprits dowhen they hear the conch shell?"""
707,00:31:03.73,00:31:03.73,"They'll cause it to rain to cleanse the, uh..."

709,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30, Okay.
710,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,  Uh... say your name
711,00:31:29.53,00:31:29.53,and stepthrough a hoop in vines.
712,00:31:31.23,00:31:31.23, Say your name and it will be all cleared up.

727,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17, Four for four.
728,00:32:50.80,00:32:50.80,   Last one.
729,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,I guess you getto keep this.
730,00:32:56.53,00:32:56.53,There you go.

737,00:33:44.40,00:33:44.40,   we'd be over by the fire   underneath the parachute.

739,00:33:49.53,00:33:49.53, RUDY:Yeah. Parachute might blow away.

744,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,Thought he had enough of it.
745,00:34:02.70,00:34:02.70,Cold and hungry.
746,00:34:03.97,00:34:03.97,I'm winning this thing.
747,00:34:05.47,00:34:05.47,"   You know, it's going to bean uphill battle for me,"
748,00:34:07.30,00:34:07.30,  but I'm winning this thing--the whole show.
749,00:34:15.73,00:34:15.73,"RICHARD:  So we're back to...   where we were, eh?"
750,00:34:19.07,00:34:19.07,We were just talking
751,00:34:20.87,00:34:20.87,about whetherit's Sean or Rudy.

753,00:34:26.50,00:34:26.50,  are going right to the end.

755,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,where the jury picks one of us.
756,00:34:34.43,00:34:34.43,Yeah. It should bean interesting council.
757,00:34:36.60,00:34:36.60,Mm-hmm.
758,00:34:37.70,00:34:37.70,RICHARD: The balance of power
759,00:34:39.33,00:34:39.33,"  I don't believe has shifted    from me to Kelly,"
760,00:34:41.53,00:34:41.53, but certainly I've lost  some footing.
761,00:34:44.87,00:34:44.87,"  Kelly wins immunity,and all kinds of things"
762,00:34:47.53,00:34:47.53, have to change   and shift quickly.
763,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,  So it's not as easy   to remain a solid alliance
764,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77, in the midst of a lot of flux
765,00:34:55.77,00:34:55.77,  with so few people.
766,00:34:57.93,00:34:57.93, KELLY: Rich has said--
767,00:34:59.13,00:34:59.13, since he knows that Sue was plotting
768,00:35:00.67,00:35:00.67,   an alliance against him--
769,00:35:01.97,00:35:01.97, he has had to rearrange  his strategy.
770,00:35:05.53,00:35:05.53," So, maybe they're not    voting together."
771,00:35:07.50,00:35:07.50, I don't know.
772,00:35:09.23,00:35:09.23,"To me, that just means game on."
773,00:35:28.87,00:35:28.87," SEAN:  I think I've always  looked at it,"
774,00:35:31.40,00:35:31.40,"  the next Tribal Council,"
775,00:35:33.10,00:35:33.10," there'll be, you know,   a lot of votes cast"
776,00:35:35.43,00:35:35.43,in different directions
777,00:35:36.90,00:35:36.90,   that were never previously  cast before.
778,00:35:38.57,00:35:38.57,  I think the three peoplethat are likely to vote for Sue
779,00:35:42.40,00:35:42.40," are me, Richard  and potentially Rudy."
780,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,  Rudy's kind of swinging.
781,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,   Rudy wants to...   wanted me whacked
782,00:35:49.13,00:35:49.13," about three weeks ago,"
783,00:35:50.77,00:35:50.77,"  so, you know...    he's a good guy."
784,00:35:52.23,00:35:52.23,"  We sleep together, but he's ready to slit my throat"
785,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10,in this contest any minute now.
786,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,Behind...
787,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07, KELLY:  I'm going to vote for either Rich or Sue.
788,00:36:03.77,00:36:03.77, Um... it's time to get dirty.
789,00:36:06.63,00:36:06.63, No more Mr. Nice Guy.
790,00:36:08.07,00:36:08.07," I... as I said, I don't know."
791,00:36:10.40,00:36:10.40,  It's every man for himself.
792,00:36:53.20,00:36:53.20,JEFF:Grab a seat.
793,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,   I'll bring in the jury...
794,00:36:56.53,00:36:56.53,which is growing.
795,00:36:58.40,00:36:58.40,"Now, Greg, Jenna,"
796,00:37:01.33,00:37:01.33,"Gervase, Colleen."
797,00:37:04.13,00:37:04.13,They'll take a seathere to observe.
798,00:37:06.30,00:37:06.30,One of you will bejoining this group tonight.
799,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,The other fourwill be moving on.
800,00:37:10.73,00:37:10.73,   Tribal Council number 12.
801,00:37:12.47,00:37:12.47,"This is big tonight,"
802,00:37:14.83,00:37:14.83,"because if you make itthrough this vote,"
803,00:37:16.80,00:37:16.80,you make itto the final four.
804,00:37:18.43,00:37:18.43,Obviously the only personhere doesn't haveto worry tonight--
805,00:37:21.30,00:37:21.30,Kelly Wiglesworth.
806,00:37:22.90,00:37:22.90,"  Kelly, how much did you need to win that immunity?"
807,00:37:26.37,00:37:26.37,   Desperately. Desperately.
808,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,  You're convinced you   were gone if not?
809,00:37:30.53,00:37:30.53,"   Pretty much, yeah."
810,00:37:31.97,00:37:31.97,"   In the situation   we're in tonight,"
811,00:37:33.37,00:37:33.37,"  as a result,  you go from somebody"
812,00:37:34.73,00:37:34.73,who might well havebeen voted off
813,00:37:36.23,00:37:36.23,to the absoluteswing vote.
814,00:37:38.03,00:37:38.03,"You can't be voted on,"
815,00:37:39.33,00:37:39.33,but you're goingto vote for somebody.
816,00:37:41.57,00:37:41.57,Indeed.
817,00:37:43.00,00:37:43.00,Did the mood around you change at all in the last day?
818,00:37:45.47,00:37:45.47,"   I'd say so, yeah."
819,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50," I think the mood, you know..."
820,00:37:48.73,00:37:48.73,pretty much everybodywith the whole group
821,00:37:50.93,00:37:50.93,and the new dynamics
822,00:37:52.80,00:37:52.80,  and three days lefthas changed quite a bit.
823,00:37:57.53,00:37:57.53,"JEFF:What about you, Rich?"
824,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,   What do you think   the take is on you
825,00:38:01.30,00:38:01.30,from the American public point of view.
826,00:38:03.37,00:38:03.37," Hopefully, the people   who watch the show"
827,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33, would see somebody who's kindof known what he was looking for
828,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,"from the beginning,and has kind of"
829,00:38:10.93,00:38:10.93,worked towardhis goal
830,00:38:13.27,00:38:13.27,   as ethically as he  could do it.
831,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,"JEFF:Rudy, you beenaround a long time."
832,00:38:16.53,00:38:16.53, You're definitely the veteran of this group.
833,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,You're flying low
834,00:38:20.50,00:38:20.50,under the radar.
835,00:38:21.77,00:38:21.77,   What do you think
836,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,people are saying aboutyou at this point?
837,00:38:24.93,00:38:24.93," Well, I know the wholeAtlantic fleet is saying"
838,00:38:27.27,00:38:27.27,"  ""What's that old son of a...doing in there?"""
839,00:38:30.07,00:38:30.07,"   You know, and, uh,"
840,00:38:31.20,00:38:31.20,I'll have to answer 'emwhen I get back.
841,00:38:34.10,00:38:34.10,"   Do you think your buddies are going, ""Go, Rudy!"""
842,00:38:35.87,00:38:35.87,"Or, ""I can't wait to see this guy...?"""
843,00:38:37.47,00:38:37.47,"Oh, yeah, yeah.   They're behind me."
844,00:38:40.40,00:38:40.40,   They'd better be.
845,00:38:41.57,00:38:41.57,Even after you saidyou liked the homo?
846,00:38:43.30,00:38:43.30,Huh?
847,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"That's a goodquestion, though."
848,00:38:45.93,00:38:45.93," You've made a couple of jokes,  you know, that Rich"
849,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,"is definitelya friend,"
850,00:38:49.20,00:38:49.20,but you wouldn't wantto be seen with him
851,00:38:50.83,00:38:50.83,around your buddies.
852,00:38:52.40,00:38:52.40,"  When we're done with this,  I'm going to shake his hand"
853,00:38:54.37,00:38:54.37,and hope I never see you again.
854,00:38:55.80,00:38:55.80,That's it.
855,00:38:57.87,00:38:57.87,   Is there a sense of dread
856,00:38:58.97,00:38:58.97,coming overyou guys
857,00:39:00.37,00:39:00.37,"that, you know,this whole idea"
858,00:39:02.27,00:39:02.27,of the alliance nowhas to be reckoned with?
859,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,Actions come into play.
860,00:39:05.97,00:39:05.97," At one point,"
861,00:39:06.97,00:39:06.97,"whether it washappenstance or not,"
862,00:39:08.70,00:39:08.70,Pagong members werevoted off one by one.
863,00:39:10.57,00:39:10.57,Now they're sittingacross from you
864,00:39:12.60,00:39:12.60,"ready to say,""Now it's my turn."""
865,00:39:14.93,00:39:14.93,"   How's that sittin'with you, Sean?"
866,00:39:16.27,00:39:16.27,It's sitting fine with me.
867,00:39:17.73,00:39:17.73,"I think the peoplethat got to know me,"
868,00:39:19.67,00:39:19.67,got to understand me
869,00:39:20.80,00:39:20.80,and know whereI'm coming from...
870,00:39:22.27,00:39:22.27,"But, you know,like I said"
871,00:39:23.97,00:39:23.97,I've conducted myselfin a different manner
872,00:39:25.90,00:39:25.90,"than everybody,you know-- unique."
873,00:39:28.10,00:39:28.10,"Uh, was it smart?I don't know."
874,00:39:30.10,00:39:30.10,Did it make me feel good?Absolutely.
875,00:39:32.40,00:39:32.40,"Yeah. I mean, I'mvery comfortable"
876,00:39:33.87,00:39:33.87,with them judging meat this point.
877,00:39:35.57,00:39:35.57,JEFF:Last question-- Sue:
878,00:39:37.63,00:39:37.63,  At one point  you said early on...
879,00:39:39.10,00:39:39.10,"   I think, in fact, it might have been to Rich..."
880,00:39:40.93,00:39:40.93,I'm not sure.
881,00:39:42.67,00:39:42.67,"   One of the first few days   here, you said, ""Listen--"
882,00:39:44.73,00:39:44.73,"""I'm just a redneckand corporate America"
883,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,"isn't goingto play here."""
884,00:39:47.30,00:39:47.30,"RICHARD:Oh, she sure did."
885,00:39:48.60,00:39:48.60,"But just a coupleof Tribal Councils ago,"
886,00:39:50.13,00:39:50.13,  you made a pretty good case
887,00:39:51.43,00:39:51.43,  for the fact that what goes on here
888,00:39:52.93,00:39:52.93,  at Survivor  is really no different
889,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37,than what goes onin corporate America.
890,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37,"Oh, yeah."
891,00:39:56.77,00:39:56.77,   So my question is   what has won out--
892,00:39:58.50,00:39:58.50,"   simple Midwestern values,  or the harsh reality"
893,00:40:00.73,00:40:00.73,of corporate life?
894,00:40:02.00,00:40:02.00,"It ain't over with yet,"
895,00:40:03.63,00:40:03.63," so you can't say who'swon out yet, eh?"
896,00:40:06.27,00:40:06.27,The idea of money--
897,00:40:08.17,00:40:08.17,money makesthe world go round.
898,00:40:09.73,00:40:09.73,"Money is greed, money iswhat everybody thrives for."
899,00:40:12.50,00:40:12.50,I don't care whatanybody says anymore.
900,00:40:15.33,00:40:15.33,   Um... it's what spins us.
901,00:40:18.67,00:40:18.67,It can make lifea little bit easier.
902,00:40:20.87,00:40:20.87,"If you're,you know, struggling,"
903,00:40:22.20,00:40:22.20,"or whatever,"
904,00:40:23.20,00:40:23.20,it helps.
905,00:40:24.73,00:40:24.73,"  Big fights, divorces happenover shortages of money,"
906,00:40:27.80,00:40:27.80," so... a lot to be said   about money, Jeff."
907,00:40:30.17,00:40:30.17,That's what we're talking about.
908,00:40:32.33,00:40:32.33,On that note...
909,00:40:33.80,00:40:33.80,   it's time to vote.
910,00:40:34.80,00:40:34.80,Rich.
911,00:40:46.20,00:40:46.20,  I'm voting for Sue tonight.
912,00:40:47.57,00:40:47.57, Not for any particular reason.
913,00:40:49.33,00:40:49.33,  She's a good friend of mine
914,00:40:50.83,00:40:50.83,"   and will always be a good friend of mine,"
915,00:40:52.67,00:40:52.67,  but it's a self-  preservation maneuver
916,00:40:55.23,00:40:55.23,"  and, uh, needed to be done."
917,00:41:07.73,00:41:07.73,  It was fun.
918,00:41:09.37,00:41:09.37,"   Good luck, buddy."
919,00:41:16.20,00:41:16.20,   Fire definitely represents  life on the island.
920,00:41:19.23,00:41:19.23,"Across from you now,11 staffs."
921,00:41:23.40,00:41:23.40,Another onewill be added
922,00:41:24.90,00:41:24.90,to thatgroup tonight.
923,00:41:26.53,00:41:26.53,Four of you willmove on.
924,00:41:28.33,00:41:28.33,I'll go tally the votes.
925,00:41:49.60,00:41:49.60,"  Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final"
926,00:41:52.93,00:41:52.93,  and the person will be askedto leave the island immediately.
927,00:41:55.60,00:41:55.60,I'll read the votes.
928,00:42:03.90,00:42:03.90,"""Sue."""

934,00:42:32.60,00:42:32.60,SEAN:Wow... someone snuck upbehind me. Come on.
935,00:42:36.13,00:42:36.13,It went outduring the vote.
936,00:42:37.37,00:42:37.37,No...

950,00:43:15.40,00:43:15.40,   and a lot of cash.
951,00:43:16.93,00:43:16.93,   You can head back to camp.
952,00:43:18.83,00:43:18.83,I'll see youtomorrow.

957,00:43:50.80,00:43:50.80, I conducted myself very well here.
