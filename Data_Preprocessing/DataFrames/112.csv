2,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,   ANNOUNCER:  16 Americans marooned    for 39 days
3,00:00:04.97,00:00:04.97, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:06.93,00:00:06.93,"  Separated into two tribes--     Tagi and Pagong,"
5,00:00:10.87,00:00:10.87, they competed    against each other
6,00:00:12.50,00:00:12.50,  to remain on the island.
7,00:00:13.97,00:00:13.97,  But now the tribes   have merged into one.
8,00:00:15.93,00:00:15.93," Rattana is the name,"
9,00:00:17.80,00:00:17.80,  and it is everyone  for themselves.
10,00:00:20.10,00:00:20.10,"  Every third night,"
11,00:00:21.60,00:00:21.60,  the entire tribe will hike   deep into the jungle
12,00:00:23.93,00:00:23.93," to take part  in the Tribal Council,"
13,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
14,00:00:29.50,00:00:29.50,"  In the end, one will remain"
15,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.
16,00:00:39.33,00:00:39.33, Last week on Survivor:
17,00:00:42.57,00:00:42.57,  The Tagi alliance  threatened to crumble.
18,00:00:45.03,00:00:45.03,RICHARD:  It seems like Kelly might be   flip-flopping
19,00:00:47.77,00:00:47.77, and planning strategies  at our expense.
20,00:00:50.27,00:00:50.27, SUSAN:   When I turn around     and see somebody
21,00:00:51.93,00:00:51.93," starting to dig     a knife into my backside,"
22,00:00:53.57,00:00:53.57, it just really pisses me off.
23,00:00:56.00,00:00:56.00, JEFF:  And island living was wearing     on the castaways.
24,00:00:58.80,00:00:58.80,COLLEEN:    It's not a fun game now.
25,00:01:01.60,00:01:01.60, JEFF:    Sean won a night    on a yacht
26,00:01:03.97,00:01:03.97, and a surprise visit   from his dad.
27,00:01:06.37,00:01:06.37,Dad!
28,00:01:07.73,00:01:07.73,  Kelly found herself   in hot water.
29,00:01:10.00,00:01:10.00,"RICHARD:    Kelly, on the other hand,    has no idea"
30,00:01:11.17,00:01:11.17,that she's leaving this evening.
31,00:01:12.37,00:01:12.37, JEFF:  But she saved herself
32,00:01:14.80,00:01:14.80,  by winning  the immunity challenge.
33,00:01:16.10,00:01:16.10,"Instead, Colleen paid the price"
34,00:01:18.20,00:01:18.20,and was the final Pagong member    voted off.
35,00:01:20.10,00:01:20.10,  Only five from the original    Tagi Tribe remain.
36,00:01:22.73,00:01:22.73, It's anyone's guess who will   be voted off tonight.
37,00:01:25.93,00:01:25.93,  Captioning sponsored by CBS and SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
38,00:02:38.97,00:02:38.97,"RICHARD: Why are we leaving Rattana, though?"
39,00:02:40.77,00:02:40.77,That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.
40,00:02:42.83,00:02:42.83, SUSAN:  You think that    Rattana played on?
41,00:02:44.20,00:02:44.20,Yeah.
42,00:02:45.20,00:02:45.20,RICHARD: A bunch of individuals
43,00:02:46.63,00:02:46.63,playing a game.
44,00:02:47.67,00:02:47.67,Rattana was absolutely meaningless.
45,00:02:49.10,00:02:49.10,SEAN: Rattana was meaningless.
46,00:02:50.23,00:02:50.23,"SUSAN: Yeah, Rattana was meaningless."
47,00:02:51.60,00:02:51.60,Tagi was... meant something.
48,00:02:52.60,00:02:52.60,RICHARD: Our name.
49,00:02:53.60,00:02:53.60,"Oh, yeah, especially"
50,00:02:54.63,00:02:54.63,when we were up against Pagong.
51,00:02:55.80,00:02:55.80,  There's no such thing as...
52,00:02:57.57,00:02:57.57,"  for me, a Tagi Tribe  or a Rattana."
53,00:02:59.53,00:02:59.53,  That was the stupidest thing  I ever heard.
54,00:03:02.10,00:03:02.10,   Or... or any other tribe.
55,00:03:03.53,00:03:03.53,  It never existed   and it doesn't exist.
56,00:03:06.10,00:03:06.10,"  It's a group of 16 people,"
57,00:03:08.27,00:03:08.27, four of whom were in    an alliance
58,00:03:09.63,00:03:09.63, with me    and a bunch of other ones.
59,00:03:11.30,00:03:11.30,And it meant something.
60,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,Now it's five individuals
61,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,just playing a game and hanging out.
62,00:03:18.47,00:03:18.47,That's good.
63,00:03:23.20,00:03:23.20," SEAN:   Yeah, everyone's hunky-dory     and all friends,"
64,00:03:25.53,00:03:25.53, but they all come to me
65,00:03:26.87,00:03:26.87," and they say bad things  about Richard,"
66,00:03:28.57,00:03:28.57," or they say bad things    about Rudy,"
67,00:03:29.57,00:03:29.57,and then they go to Rudy
68,00:03:31.00,00:03:31.00," and they say bad things     about me,"
69,00:03:32.00,00:03:32.00," and they go to Rich,"
70,00:03:33.63,00:03:33.63,  they say bad things     about Rudy and I.
71,00:03:36.00,00:03:36.00,"Sean's just... you know, talking to me all day about"
72,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,making sure I convince my man-- Rudy--
73,00:03:41.60,00:03:41.60,to vote for Sue.
74,00:03:44.03,00:03:44.03, If somebody gave me their word
75,00:03:46.27,00:03:46.27," that they are in this alliance with me,"
76,00:03:49.30,00:03:49.30,"  and I give my word, my word is good,"
77,00:03:51.93,00:03:51.93, and their word better be good.
78,00:03:54.57,00:03:54.57,"   If they betray me, I'll get even with them."
79,00:03:57.57,00:03:57.57,"Rudy talks about, ""People give me their word..."
80,00:03:59.60,00:03:59.60,"""I have friends."
81,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,"  ""I have friends back at home"
82,00:04:02.00,00:04:02.00," that take care  of people like that."""
83,00:04:03.43,00:04:03.43,"Oh, man."
84,00:04:05.73,00:04:05.73,  I don't know    who I'm playing with here.
85,00:04:07.53,00:04:07.53,"I'm, like, ""Get me out of here.  Send me home."""
86,00:04:09.80,00:04:09.80,Rudy's something else.
87,00:04:11.00,00:04:11.00," RUDY:  I mean, it's a game,"
88,00:04:12.83,00:04:12.83, but it's worth    a million dollars.
89,00:04:15.97,00:04:15.97,  Money talks.
90,00:04:17.07,00:04:17.07,You've pretty much got Rudy...
91,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,Yeah.
92,00:04:19.40,00:04:19.40,Yeah.
93,00:04:19.40,00:04:19.40,Under control.
94,00:04:20.90,00:04:20.90,  He always just looks    to me and goes...
95,00:04:22.40,00:04:22.40,"He goes, ""Hey, who?"""
96,00:04:23.60,00:04:23.60,I don't care. Don't worry about it.
97,00:04:25.23,00:04:25.23,You have my word and I gave it to you...
98,00:04:28.37,00:04:28.37,"  Rich is a smart guy and he's really tricky,"
99,00:04:31.27,00:04:31.27,"   and, uh, I don't trust him one bit."
100,00:04:33.20,00:04:33.20,  I never really have.
101,00:04:34.57,00:04:34.57, Whatever it takes to win here  is the point.
102,00:04:38.40,00:04:38.40,"It's a game, and call it   Machiavellian, sure."
103,00:04:40.23,00:04:40.23,I'd much rather it be Rudy left.
104,00:04:42.93,00:04:42.93,Than Sue.
105,00:04:44.50,00:04:44.50,"   'Cause then you and I are, you know, definitely..."
106,00:04:46.73,00:04:46.73,going to the top.
107,00:04:48.20,00:04:48.20,So Kelly goes next.
108,00:04:50.17,00:04:50.17,"So it will now be you, Sean, me and Sue."
109,00:04:53.97,00:04:53.97,I don't think you're any better off against anybody else.
110,00:04:56.77,00:04:56.77,"In other words, getting there with anybody but me."
111,00:04:59.60,00:04:59.60,"Hopefully, it will be us three."
112,00:05:01.60,00:05:01.60, SEAN:    This is the most
113,00:05:03.27,00:05:03.27,  conniving bunch of people     I've ever met in my life.
114,00:05:05.43,00:05:05.43,  There's not an honest one   in the bunch.
115,00:05:08.50,00:05:08.50," Conniving, conniving,    conniving."
116,00:05:10.57,00:05:10.57, Things are falling apart here
117,00:05:15.53,00:05:15.53,   at Rattana Beach.
118,00:05:16.53,00:05:16.53,   ( voices arguing )
119,00:05:17.77,00:05:17.77,You told them you weren't aligned with us.
120,00:05:20.40,00:05:20.40,Colleen told me that.
121,00:05:21.73,00:05:21.73,That's bull ( blip ).
122,00:05:23.43,00:05:23.43,"I don't give a ( blip ),"
123,00:05:24.67,00:05:24.67,because I trust her more than I trust you.
124,00:05:26.40,00:05:26.40,Why? That's bull ( blip ).
125,00:05:27.63,00:05:27.63,I've been your friend since day one.
126,00:05:29.37,00:05:29.37,No. I'm going fishing.
127,00:05:30.37,00:05:30.37,That's bull ( blip ).
128,00:05:31.70,00:05:31.70,Will you talk to me?
129,00:05:33.00,00:05:33.00,No. I don't have to.
130,00:05:49.80,00:05:49.80,What did you just ask Sue?
131,00:05:51.50,00:05:51.50,Sue feels that
132,00:05:53.23,00:05:53.23,I ( blip ) her...
133,00:05:54.40,00:05:54.40,or have ( blip ) the four of us...
134,00:05:56.03,00:05:56.03,I don't understand what that's coming from.
135,00:05:57.93,00:05:57.93,Because... because I tried to make the Pagong team think
136,00:06:00.10,00:06:00.10,that we weren't going to eliminate them one by one?
137,00:06:02.40,00:06:02.40,I thought that was part of the game.
138,00:06:04.33,00:06:04.33, SUSAN:  Kelly made all the rest of us   look like a bunch of idiots.
139,00:06:07.20,00:06:07.20,Then she made all the rest of us  look like the bad guys
140,00:06:10.60,00:06:10.60,and her the one good guy   out of the whole five of us.
141,00:06:13.80,00:06:13.80,   That's what irritated me.
142,00:06:15.23,00:06:15.23,Sue doesn't have all the facts.
143,00:06:16.60,00:06:16.60,Uh-huh.
144,00:06:17.70,00:06:17.70,I was trying to pretend
145,00:06:19.00,00:06:19.00, that we weren't going   to eliminate
146,00:06:20.37,00:06:20.37,"them one by one,   as I've said before,"
147,00:06:22.03,00:06:22.03, and I thought that was    part of the plan.
148,00:06:23.57,00:06:23.57,"We had said when they come,"
149,00:06:24.73,00:06:24.73,"we're going to split up,"
150,00:06:25.90,00:06:25.90,we're going to hang out with them.
151,00:06:27.53,00:06:27.53,  I wasn't trying to work them    for myself at all.
152,00:06:28.93,00:06:28.93,They all wanted to vote you off.
153,00:06:30.43,00:06:30.43,"They tried to come to me and say,"
154,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,"""Hey, we can be in the majority.  We can vote Rich off."""
155,00:06:33.87,00:06:33.87,   I didn't.
156,00:06:34.93,00:06:34.93,I know. I think it was a smart decision.
157,00:06:36.57,00:06:36.57,Sue said many times that she wasn't part
158,00:06:38.67,00:06:38.67, of an alliance either.
159,00:06:40.20,00:06:40.20,"So, now all of a sudden I'm two-faced and I ( blip ) her"
160,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,"   when she had approached me    and said,"
161,00:06:44.43,00:06:44.43,"  ""Hey, Rich and I have formed   an alliance"
162,00:06:46.23,00:06:46.23,"  ""to vote you off at the end,"
163,00:06:47.53,00:06:47.53," ""but I'm not going to do that."
164,00:06:49.00,00:06:49.00," Let's you and I vote him off."""
165,00:06:50.47,00:06:50.47,If I was trying to plot against you
166,00:06:52.33,00:06:52.33,and plot against Sue...
167,00:06:53.67,00:06:53.67,Uh-huh.
168,00:06:54.87,00:06:54.87,"...and trying to use them in my best interests,"
169,00:06:56.47,00:06:56.47,then I would have voted for you.
170,00:06:57.93,00:06:57.93,But I decided...
171,00:06:57.93,00:06:57.93,"Yeah, I don't think that's true."
172,00:06:59.27,00:06:59.27,...I wanted to stay true to our... to our alliance--
173,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,to our four that we decided on from the beginning.
174,00:07:03.00,00:07:03.00,   Right. Right.
175,00:07:04.60,00:07:04.60,"   When Kelly said to me, um,    ""Are you pissed off at me?"
176,00:07:07.10,00:07:07.10,"It seems to me like you  and Sue are pissed off at me."""
177,00:07:10.23,00:07:10.23," Well, that was my opportunity    to come in"
178,00:07:13.47,00:07:13.47,"   and smooth things,"
179,00:07:15.43,00:07:15.43,   as opposed to be the one    who upsets the applecart.
180,00:07:18.70,00:07:18.70,"Thanks, Kells Bells."
181,00:07:20.90,00:07:20.90, So certainly that little tiff   between Kelly and Sue
182,00:07:23.73,00:07:23.73, has been coming
183,00:07:25.17,00:07:25.17,"   and plays to my advantage,   absolutely."
184,00:07:55.53,00:07:55.53," Aw, it hurts."
185,00:07:57.60,00:07:57.60,  This is my second ray sting  since I've been here.
186,00:08:00.13,00:08:00.13,"  Oh, and trust me, they hurt."
187,00:08:01.63,00:08:01.63,  It's like an aching sting
188,00:08:03.17,00:08:03.17,"  and it hurts from my knuckle   down to about here,"
189,00:08:06.07,00:08:06.07,  and it's constantly pounding   and it aches
190,00:08:08.57,00:08:08.57,and it hurts really bad.
191,00:08:11.67,00:08:11.67," I might act like a tough girl,    but they do hurt."
192,00:08:14.67,00:08:14.67, They gouge me.
193,00:08:15.67,00:08:15.67, This one got me good.
194,00:08:17.20,00:08:17.20,Notice the hand.
195,00:08:18.77,00:08:18.77, The knuckles are still swollen   from that ray bite.
196,00:08:22.80,00:08:22.80,I seen that tail come in   and just slice that.
197,00:08:25.67,00:08:25.67,"   Ow, was I pissed."
198,00:08:26.73,00:08:26.73,Cause he was in a little hole.
199,00:08:27.73,00:08:27.73,He couldn't go anywhere but out.
200,00:08:29.07,00:08:29.07,"You know, he couldn't go back or forward."
201,00:08:30.63,00:08:30.63,He had to come out.
202,00:08:32.27,00:08:32.27,KELLY: At least you get to eat the bastard.
203,00:08:53.20,00:08:53.20,RICHARD:  Sixth day to the end.
204,00:08:54.97,00:08:54.97, Desperate to go home.
205,00:08:56.63,00:08:56.63, Really looking forward     to enter reality.
206,00:08:59.97,00:08:59.97," For me, this maintaining some kind of a thumb"
207,00:09:04.27,00:09:04.27,on ev... all of these different  people's personalities
208,00:09:07.00,00:09:07.00," that I care very little about,    uh, is exhausting."
209,00:09:10.60,00:09:10.60,  I'm ready for the people
210,00:09:12.47,00:09:12.47," in my life that I've brought   into my life,"
211,00:09:14.93,00:09:14.93,  throughout my life.
212,00:09:16.27,00:09:16.27,And I'm looking forward to getting back to that
213,00:09:18.87,00:09:18.87,   with a vengeance.
214,00:09:20.03,00:09:20.03, SEAN:   I've been wishing for home
215,00:09:22.37,00:09:22.37,   since the day I got here.
216,00:09:23.77,00:09:23.77,I haven't been away from   New York in this long ever.
217,00:09:26.20,00:09:26.20, I miss my favorite restaurant.
218,00:09:27.73,00:09:27.73,  I miss the people    at the restaurant.
219,00:09:28.73,00:09:28.73,  I miss my friends.
220,00:09:29.93,00:09:29.93,  I miss my family.
221,00:09:31.43,00:09:31.43,"  You know, I miss     all those things."
222,00:09:32.93,00:09:32.93,I'm just looking forward
223,00:09:34.17,00:09:34.17,to talking to my husband  on the phone.
224,00:09:35.33,00:09:35.33, I can't wait for that.
225,00:09:36.53,00:09:36.53,"I get anywhere within a phone to make a call,"
226,00:09:38.43,00:09:38.43,"that's what I'm doing, is calling home."
227,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33,Uh-huh.
228,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33,I don't give a ( blip ) what time of day it is there.
229,00:09:48.77,00:09:48.77,RICHARD:  The end of days
230,00:09:50.60,00:09:50.60,  is what I'm thinking about  as I lay here on a raft
231,00:09:53.67,00:09:53.67, in the middle of the   South China Sea on a beach--
232,00:09:56.83,00:09:56.83,  in my bed.
233,00:10:02.30,00:10:02.30," Yeah, it's very pretty."
234,00:10:05.10,00:10:05.10,"  It's a beautiful,     beautiful night."
235,00:10:06.53,00:10:06.53," Cloudy, but I like the clouds."
236,00:10:08.83,00:10:08.83,"I'm just looking at the clouds,"
237,00:10:11.13,00:10:11.13,thinking of going home.
238,00:10:13.03,00:10:13.03,   Waiting...
239,00:10:14.17,00:10:14.17,  waiting...
240,00:10:16.50,00:10:16.50, with no watch.
241,00:10:17.50,00:10:17.50,Having no idea what time it is.
242,00:10:19.50,00:10:19.50, Just knowing that time    is passing slowly.
243,00:10:52.43,00:10:52.43,Oh.
244,00:10:53.70,00:10:53.70,( laughing )
245,00:10:54.83,00:10:54.83,"   ""Dig in."""

247,00:10:57.70,00:10:57.70,That's mud from the mud volcano.
248,00:10:59.90,00:10:59.90,We got to dig in
249,00:11:01.13,00:11:01.13,to find the clue?
250,00:11:02.70,00:11:02.70,Yeah.
251,00:11:04.10,00:11:04.10,All it is is swamp mud.
252,00:11:05.60,00:11:05.60,I'm going to rinse my hand off.
253,00:11:07.60,00:11:07.60,I think that's cool.
254,00:11:08.93,00:11:08.93,What?
255,00:11:09.93,00:11:09.93,The bucket and the mud.
256,00:11:11.43,00:11:11.43,We're going to have to do some kind of digging.
257,00:11:22.60,00:11:22.60,"Oh, I found it."
258,00:11:24.40,00:11:24.40,"Oh, cool! Read it."
259,00:11:26.43,00:11:26.43,Read it to me.
260,00:11:27.43,00:11:27.43,"What's it say, Rudy?"

266,00:11:38.60,00:11:38.60,Another trip out of here would be nice.
267,00:11:41.70,00:11:41.70,That's good news.
268,00:11:43.27,00:11:43.27,It is.
269,00:11:48.50,00:11:48.50, JEFF:   It's Day 35 on the island
270,00:11:50.73,00:11:50.73,and old friends    are becoming new enemies.
271,00:11:55.10,00:11:55.10," So, for today's     reward challenge,"
272,00:11:57.93,00:11:57.93,  the tribe members will head    to the mud volcano
273,00:11:59.77,00:11:59.77," and, perhaps,    calm things down a little."
274,00:12:02.70,00:12:02.70,  This mud volcano actually    created the entire island.
275,00:12:06.40,00:12:06.40," Today,   the tribe members will engage"
276,00:12:09.07,00:12:09.07,  in some therapeutic   mud bathing.
277,00:12:11.27,00:12:11.27,"Okay, here's what I know."
278,00:12:13.03,00:12:13.03," A bit of a blowout yesterday, shouldn't be unexpected,"
279,00:12:17.37,00:12:17.37,  so the idea today is to have  a different kind of a blowout.
280,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,   The goal is pretty simple:
281,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,get as much mud   from the mud volcano
282,00:12:26.50,00:12:26.50,"into your bucket   as you can in five minutes,"
283,00:12:30.07,00:12:30.07,using your body    as the transport vehicle.
284,00:12:33.23,00:12:33.23,  So you go over and lather up   as much as you can.
285,00:12:35.63,00:12:35.63,"You come back over here, shake off, squeeze out--"
286,00:12:38.47,00:12:38.47,   whatever you want.
287,00:12:40.07,00:12:40.07,"If that doesn't  take the tension off,"
288,00:12:41.47,00:12:41.47,nothing takes the edge off
289,00:12:44.07,00:12:44.07,"like a cold beer, right?"
290,00:12:46.17,00:12:46.17,"  So, for the winner,"
291,00:12:48.90,00:12:48.90, one Bud Light.
292,00:12:50.40,00:12:50.40,  That's a warm-up for  what's going to happen later.
293,00:12:52.70,00:12:52.70,"Because,  for the winner, later,"
294,00:12:54.63,00:12:54.63," you're going to be picked up,"
295,00:12:56.77,00:12:56.77,"  blindfolded,   boated to a mysterious bar,"
296,00:12:59.20,00:12:59.20,   where you and I are going  to have a few more Bud Lights.
297,00:13:02.77,00:13:02.77,We're going to watch the first five minutes
298,00:13:05.50,00:13:05.50,of episode one...
299,00:13:06.70,00:13:06.70,Wow!
300,00:13:07.70,00:13:07.70,...of Survivor.
301,00:13:09.17,00:13:09.17,  Wow!
302,00:13:10.17,00:13:10.17,I like that.
303,00:13:10.17,00:13:10.17,Cool?
304,00:13:11.63,00:13:11.63,SUSAN: Yeah.
305,00:13:11.63,00:13:11.63,That works for me.
306,00:13:13.20,00:13:13.20,"Okay, I'm going to set my beer aside."
307,00:13:15.17,00:13:15.17,Let's get ready to do this thing.
308,00:13:19.73,00:13:19.73,Survivors ready...
309,00:13:21.40,00:13:21.40,Get muddy!
310,00:13:26.50,00:13:26.50,  ( whooping )
311,00:13:32.27,00:13:32.27,( laughing )
312,00:13:59.93,00:13:59.93, ( squishing )
313,00:14:37.60,00:14:37.60,"  Looking good, Rudy!"
314,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,Ten seconds!
315,00:14:52.03,00:14:52.03,Five...
316,00:14:53.10,00:14:53.10,four...
317,00:14:54.17,00:14:54.17,three...
318,00:14:55.23,00:14:55.23, two...
319,00:14:57.00,00:14:57.00,"Stop! Stop, stop, stop."
320,00:14:59.30,00:14:59.30,All right.
321,00:14:59.30,00:14:59.30,That was fun.
322,00:15:00.87,00:15:00.87,That was a blast.
323,00:15:02.57,00:15:02.57,   This is going to be close.
324,00:15:03.97,00:15:03.97,Wow.
325,00:15:03.97,00:15:03.97,"All right, we'll start on the end."
326,00:15:05.80,00:15:05.80,  Man!
327,00:15:08.17,00:15:08.17,Don't you have to move over?
328,00:15:10.90,00:15:10.90,SUSAN: Stop bouncing.
329,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,"Oh, this is going to be so close."
330,00:15:13.97,00:15:13.97,15.9 for Kelly.
331,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,That's not bad at all.
332,00:15:21.27,00:15:21.27,"Yeah, Rudy, I don't think you're as heavy."
333,00:15:23.07,00:15:23.07,No.
334,00:15:24.07,00:15:24.07,"No, that's not going to do it."
335,00:15:26.30,00:15:26.30,Right at about ten.
336,00:15:27.77,00:15:27.77,Need a little more coverage.
337,00:15:29.20,00:15:29.20,"Susan, you've got a big bucket."
338,00:15:32.30,00:15:32.30,   25 pounds.
339,00:15:33.30,00:15:33.30,15.9 is the number.
340,00:15:38.50,00:15:38.50,15.
341,00:15:40.00,00:15:40.00,"No. Aw, they get the heavy mud."
342,00:15:42.93,00:15:42.93,15.9 is the number to beat.
343,00:15:44.93,00:15:44.93,This is Sean.
344,00:15:46.73,00:15:46.73,  Who's ahead?
345,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13, SEAN:    Sean-- 16.
346,00:15:49.33,00:15:49.33,Sean was using his hair.
347,00:15:53.50,00:15:53.50,Not going to be enough.
348,00:15:55.57,00:15:55.57,"SUSAN: Wow, Kelly."
349,00:15:58.30,00:15:58.30,Wow!
350,00:15:59.97,00:15:59.97, One guy left.
351,00:16:01.53,00:16:01.53,15.9. I don't think
352,00:16:03.40,00:16:03.40,it's going to be enough.
353,00:16:05.07,00:16:05.07,  It looks like it's too easy    for you to carry.
354,00:16:06.63,00:16:06.63,I think I'm having a beer with Kelly.
355,00:16:08.50,00:16:08.50,"Oh, you're out."
356,00:16:09.67,00:16:09.67,It's not even close.
357,00:16:11.03,00:16:11.03,  Wow!
358,00:16:12.03,00:16:12.03, Yeah!
359,00:16:13.43,00:16:13.43,Give you a big hug.
360,00:16:14.43,00:16:14.43,Give me a big hug.
361,00:16:40.93,00:16:40.93,  I wish I had a bigger chest    to carry the mud.
362,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,"I've been muddy, but not this kind."
363,00:16:45.20,00:16:45.20,"   It feels good to, you know, win something."
364,00:16:47.03,00:16:47.03,"I haven't won much of anything,"
365,00:16:48.90,00:16:48.90,  but I won yesterday and I won today.
366,00:16:51.57,00:16:51.57,"   I'd feel better if it was  an immunity that I won today,"
367,00:16:54.23,00:16:54.23,"but, hopefully, I'm on a winning streak."
368,00:17:11.40,00:17:11.40,"  Everybody was very pissy  prior to the mud bath,"
369,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,myself included.
370,00:17:15.63,00:17:15.63, Things really   changed here today.
371,00:17:17.10,00:17:17.10,"  There was a fight,    for the first time"
372,00:17:18.67,00:17:18.67,"  between Kelly and Sue, but,    truthfully,"
373,00:17:20.77,00:17:20.77,  this little shenanigan game
374,00:17:22.93,00:17:22.93," at the mud bath thing     really paid off, I think."
375,00:17:25.27,00:17:25.27,And it did-- it rejuvenated us.
376,00:17:27.33,00:17:27.33,"I think it rekindled, you know,  just, like, friendships"
377,00:17:29.83,00:17:29.83," and laughing,   and things like that."
378,00:17:31.67,00:17:31.67,"SUSAN:  Yeah, the mud game  was a blast."
379,00:17:34.77,00:17:34.77, I had a blast. Fun--  totally a lot of fun.
380,00:17:37.83,00:17:37.83," When we got back from the mud,    we were washing..."
381,00:17:40.03,00:17:40.03,   helping each other get the mud off
382,00:17:41.23,00:17:41.23, and things like that.
383,00:17:42.57,00:17:42.57,"Let me clean my ears out, then you take it."
384,00:17:44.70,00:17:44.70,   RICHARD:  It's bizarre to me
385,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,how people do the things    they do--
386,00:17:49.43,00:17:49.43, like how Sue and Kelly
387,00:17:51.07,00:17:51.07, are washing each other's back     and hair
388,00:17:52.73,00:17:52.73,"and, you know, laughing, joking"
389,00:17:54.83,00:17:54.83," and hugging,   and picking each other's zits"
390,00:17:56.70,00:17:56.70, and all the rest of it
391,00:17:58.10,00:17:58.10," right now, after what"
392,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33, they went through yesterday.
393,00:18:01.20,00:18:01.20,SUSAN: Doing the mud thing really wore
394,00:18:04.30,00:18:04.30,"   a lot of energy out of us,"
395,00:18:05.80,00:18:05.80, so it did key us down   quite a bit.
396,00:18:07.57,00:18:07.57,"And Kelly's the only other girl  on the island with me,"
397,00:18:11.13,00:18:11.13, so we're going   to hang together to the end.
398,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77, This is my big  getting-ready moment.
399,00:18:26.70,00:18:26.70,I hear a boat.
400,00:18:26.70,00:18:26.70,"I do, I hear the boat."
401,00:18:28.50,00:18:28.50,Here he comes--
402,00:18:30.33,00:18:30.33,the wondrous one.
403,00:18:31.97,00:18:31.97,"Bigger boat, girl."
404,00:18:33.67,00:18:33.67,They brought your limo to pick you up.
405,00:18:37.10,00:18:37.10,"Have fun on your night out, kiddo."
406,00:18:39.40,00:18:39.40,   Have fun.    I hope there's...
407,00:18:41.13,00:18:41.13," Have a good one, kid."
408,00:18:42.77,00:18:42.77,See you later.
409,00:18:54.00,00:18:54.00," Bye, you guys."
410,00:18:56.83,00:18:56.83, See you later.
411,00:19:11.33,00:19:11.33,Now I'm going to take you this way.
412,00:19:14.10,00:19:14.10,Hear that.
413,00:19:16.87,00:19:16.87,"   Oh, a bar."
414,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,There's cigarettes if you're so inclined.
415,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,"Can I get food, too?"
416,00:19:22.23,00:19:22.23," And food, yes."
417,00:19:23.73,00:19:23.73," Okay, hold on."
418,00:19:25.00,00:19:25.00,Let me pull your chair out.
419,00:19:27.00,00:19:27.00,"Oh, a chair... Look at you!"
420,00:19:28.30,00:19:28.30,"Okay, right over here, actually."
421,00:19:29.73,00:19:29.73,Now sit down. If you feel
422,00:19:31.23,00:19:31.23,"like you're getting looks, that's because there aren't..."
423,00:19:34.53,00:19:34.53,  More Americans blindfolded.
424,00:19:36.07,00:19:36.07,Typical.
425,00:19:37.33,00:19:37.33,This looks normal.
426,00:19:38.73,00:19:38.73,Uh-huh.
427,00:19:43.27,00:19:43.27,"   Okay, want a beer?"
428,00:19:45.03,00:19:45.03,  Yes.
429,00:19:46.10,00:19:46.10,  Can we get two Buds?
430,00:19:50.03,00:19:50.03,Thanks.
431,00:19:51.03,00:19:51.03,Yay!
432,00:19:52.17,00:19:52.17,   Right on.
433,00:19:53.40,00:19:53.40,"Thank you, thank you."
434,00:19:57.00,00:19:57.00,"All right, let's toast."
435,00:19:58.90,00:19:58.90,That's good stuff.
436,00:20:00.17,00:20:00.17,This Bud's for you.
437,00:20:01.77,00:20:01.77,"Oh, thank you."
438,00:20:03.10,00:20:03.10,Cheers.
439,00:20:04.33,00:20:04.33,Cheers.
440,00:20:05.50,00:20:05.50,Aah!
441,00:20:08.03,00:20:08.03,"Oh, my God."
442,00:20:09.30,00:20:09.30,   Thank you.
443,00:20:10.83,00:20:10.83,Look at this huge plate.
444,00:20:12.77,00:20:12.77,Let me get that salt.
445,00:20:14.60,00:20:14.60, So how you hanging in?
446,00:20:16.43,00:20:16.43,I'm doing good.
447,00:20:17.90,00:20:17.90, Yeah?
448,00:20:19.17,00:20:19.17,"Yeah, the game's, um... you know,"
449,00:20:21.37,00:20:21.37,finally gotten weird.
450,00:20:22.90,00:20:22.90,It's finally gotten crazy.
451,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,Finally gotten intense.
452,00:20:26.03,00:20:26.03,Really?
453,00:20:27.40,00:20:27.40,"I thought I could trust Sue,"
454,00:20:28.60,00:20:28.60,which was my first mistake.
455,00:20:29.80,00:20:29.80,I guess you can't trust anybody.
456,00:20:31.10,00:20:31.10,I don't lose any respect for her
457,00:20:33.90,00:20:33.90,  for playing the game at all.
458,00:20:35.57,00:20:35.57," We're not... you know,"
459,00:20:36.90,00:20:36.90, I said something today on the trail...
460,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,"  I was, like, wait a minute-- we're not evil."
461,00:20:41.63,00:20:41.63, We just play bad people on TV.
462,00:20:43.57,00:20:43.57,Whether it's every man for himself
463,00:20:45.47,00:20:45.47," or whatever, I would like to,  uh..."
464,00:20:47.70,00:20:47.70,"  smooth things over with Sue,"
465,00:20:49.47,00:20:49.47, because that was just  completely... there was no...
466,00:20:52.97,00:20:52.97,  It'll be interesting    to see how this plays out.
467,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,I know.
468,00:21:09.93,00:21:09.93,JEFF: I have a very special friend
469,00:21:11.93,00:21:11.93, that I was going to show her   something on the TV.
470,00:21:14.43,00:21:14.43, Is that okay?
471,00:21:16.03,00:21:16.03,Okay.
472,00:21:16.03,00:21:16.03,Yeah.
473,00:21:17.40,00:21:17.40, ( patrons applauding )
474,00:21:20.87,00:21:20.87,   All right.
475,00:21:24.20,00:21:24.20,  ( patrons cheering )
476,00:21:26.03,00:21:26.03,  How many do I need?
477,00:21:29.10,00:21:29.10,Where's our box?
478,00:21:30.70,00:21:30.70, Where's the Tagi box?
479,00:21:32.87,00:21:32.87, JEFF:    You are witnessing
480,00:21:34.93,00:21:34.93,   16 Americans begin  an adventure that will forever
481,00:21:38.53,00:21:38.53,  change their lives.
482,00:21:39.73,00:21:39.73, They've been given two minutes
483,00:21:41.10,00:21:41.10,  to salvage whatever they can
484,00:21:42.33,00:21:42.33, off this boat.
485,00:21:44.53,00:21:44.53,"Yeah, go, Jenna!"
486,00:21:46.27,00:21:46.27,That was awesome.
487,00:21:47.77,00:21:47.77,That was so cool.
488,00:21:49.47,00:21:49.47,"The Tagi Tribe,   who will always wear orange,"
489,00:21:52.23,00:21:52.23,"consists of Rudy Boesch,   a retired Navy SEAL,"
490,00:21:56.03,00:21:56.03," and Kelly Wiglesworth,"
491,00:21:57.50,00:21:57.50,a river guide from Las Vegas...
492,00:21:59.73,00:21:59.73,  ( patrons cheering )
493,00:22:04.00,00:22:04.00,"Oh, my God!"
494,00:22:12.73,00:22:12.73,  Good night.
495,00:22:14.07,00:22:14.07,  I'll see you later.
496,00:22:36.70,00:22:36.70,  RICHARD: Today is the fourth day
497,00:22:38.70,00:22:38.70, till the end of competition--
498,00:22:41.73,00:22:41.73,  the 36th day of our game.
499,00:22:43.57,00:22:43.57,  I've said it 14 times today
500,00:22:45.47,00:22:45.47,  and I still can't keep it    in my head.
501,00:22:47.60,00:22:47.60,Let's keep it fun around here
502,00:22:49.07,00:22:49.07,"for the next, you know..."
503,00:22:50.43,00:22:50.43,Keep it fun?
504,00:22:50.43,00:22:50.43,Yeah.
505,00:22:51.43,00:22:51.43,It's going
506,00:22:52.43,00:22:52.43,"to be tough, emotion-wise"
507,00:22:53.97,00:22:53.97,between Sue and Kelly.
508,00:22:55.40,00:22:55.40,"And Kelly, I think, is going to be"
509,00:22:57.60,00:22:57.60,a little sadder.
510,00:22:59.10,00:22:59.10,"She's sitting over there with her, so that's good."
511,00:23:01.13,00:23:01.13,I'm waiting to manage conflict.
512,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,"   Well, you got one."
513,00:23:04.30,00:23:04.30,I've come to a conclusion.
514,00:23:06.63,00:23:06.63,"I align with my family, who I love dearly and..."
515,00:23:10.53,00:23:10.53,"There is four days left,   and we're all going to have    to live together."
516,00:23:13.23,00:23:13.23," And Sue and I,   we kind of patched things up"
517,00:23:15.43,00:23:15.43," and she said,    ""Hey, look, this is a game."
518,00:23:17.63,00:23:17.63,"  ""I'm going to have   an alliance with Rich"
519,00:23:19.77,00:23:19.77,"  instead of you."""
520,00:23:21.10,00:23:21.10,"  I said, ""Fine. That's cool.  Play the game."""
521,00:23:22.97,00:23:22.97,If you feel that you need to align with Rich
522,00:23:25.10,00:23:25.10,to get you as far as you can...
523,00:23:26.43,00:23:26.43,That's what I'm saying.
524,00:23:27.77,00:23:27.77,And you're playing the game
525,00:23:29.60,00:23:29.60,"and, you know, I respect that,"
526,00:23:31.60,00:23:31.60,"but I didn't, you know,"
527,00:23:33.23,00:23:33.23,you were telling me I was two-faced
528,00:23:34.73,00:23:34.73,"and telling me that I, you know,"
529,00:23:36.10,00:23:36.10,betrayed you or whatever
530,00:23:37.57,00:23:37.57,and I don't feel that I have at all.
531,00:23:39.07,00:23:39.07,"  I said, ""I think I deserve    to get to the four"
532,00:23:41.23,00:23:41.23,"  and to get to the three."""
533,00:23:42.77,00:23:42.77,"  She said,    ""I'm not going to let you."""
534,00:23:44.53,00:23:44.53,And it's the other way around--     I'm not going to let her.
535,00:23:46.87,00:23:46.87,I feel that I should maybe
536,00:23:48.13,00:23:48.13,deserve to get into the three
537,00:23:49.70,00:23:49.70,and then you guys have at it.
538,00:23:50.97,00:23:50.97,"Well, whatever, yeah, but, no, I ain't going"
539,00:23:53.17,00:23:53.17,to let you into the three
540,00:23:54.40,00:23:54.40,"if I can possibly help it,"
541,00:23:55.63,00:23:55.63,'cause you're a threat to me in the end.
542,00:23:57.50,00:23:57.50,   We'll keep to an agreement
543,00:23:59.00,00:23:59.00,that we'll treat each other civil
544,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,  till the time we leave here.
545,00:24:02.60,00:24:02.60,No sense to make it hard   on anybody.
546,00:24:04.63,00:24:04.63,"And while we're here, possibly together for the next four days..."
547,00:24:07.77,00:24:07.77,so let's just be civil.
548,00:24:09.00,00:24:09.00,I know. That's what I thought
549,00:24:10.27,00:24:10.27,we were being-- very civil.
550,00:24:11.50,00:24:11.50,"I thought we were, too."
551,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,  I just wanted to...    to clear that up.
552,00:24:15.33,00:24:15.33,I felt that yesterday was a confusing thing
553,00:24:18.33,00:24:18.33," and, you know,  whatever happens now, happens."
554,00:24:21.33,00:24:21.33,That's right. Yeah.
555,00:24:30.70,00:24:30.70,RICHARD: Check that out.
556,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,Look at the road
557,00:24:33.10,00:24:33.10,"the ant highway,  up on the, uh, ceiling"
558,00:24:35.37,00:24:35.37," of the, uh, hut here."
559,00:24:36.80,00:24:36.80,  The canvas.
560,00:24:37.97,00:24:37.97,   Two-lane highway.
561,00:24:39.40,00:24:39.40,  You can see the ants    going in and out.
562,00:24:41.03,00:24:41.03,  Got a really  great view from here.
563,00:24:43.20,00:24:43.20, We'll build the grill    when we get back.
564,00:24:45.93,00:24:45.93,   This is my   mosquito net sarong.
565,00:24:47.77,00:24:47.77,  This is... damn it.
566,00:24:49.00,00:24:49.00,Really it's three days.
567,00:24:51.00,00:24:51.00,"Right, this is the fourth day to the end."
568,00:24:54.17,00:24:54.17,"In three days, this'll be over."
569,00:24:56.13,00:24:56.13," All I'm thinking now is ""win."""
570,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40, Do what I have to do.
571,00:24:59.90,00:24:59.90,"Now I'm in it to win, you know,"
572,00:25:01.87,00:25:01.87,and to just... just be a nice guy
573,00:25:04.47,00:25:04.47,"  and to just do this, that and the other thing"
574,00:25:06.20,00:25:06.20,and pack it in is wrong.
575,00:25:07.33,00:25:07.33,  So I got to win.
576,00:25:09.37,00:25:09.37,   I'm going to have to win immunity
577,00:25:10.83,00:25:10.83,   and I'll have to finagle.
578,00:25:12.13,00:25:12.13, And I'm   going to have to try
579,00:25:13.37,00:25:13.37, to pick up the vibe on people.
580,00:25:14.77,00:25:14.77," If, you know, like right now,"
581,00:25:16.23,00:25:16.23, Sue and Kelly   aren't getting along.
582,00:25:17.80,00:25:17.80,  There might be something  I can exploit to my advantage.
583,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,   I might have to do stuff like that.
584,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,"It's going to be a lot of work,   but I'll get there."
585,00:25:25.47,00:25:25.47," SUSAN:  Yeah, I have one more    challenge."
586,00:25:28.00,00:25:28.00,"  There's no rewards,   and you know what?"
587,00:25:29.83,00:25:29.83, I'm not even thinking    I'm going to win anymore.
588,00:25:32.03,00:25:32.03,"  I want to win the last one,   like, oh, man, if I win any--"
589,00:25:34.60,00:25:34.60,"  I'm praying, I'm praying"
590,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,  that I win     the very last immunity--
591,00:25:37.50,00:25:37.50,"  if I'm here, if I make it  through the next four,"
592,00:25:39.83,00:25:39.83, which I think I will.
593,00:25:41.00,00:25:41.00,"Oh, the mailbox is getting further away."
594,00:25:44.07,00:25:44.07,There it is.

613,00:26:33.57,00:26:33.57, What was that? What was that?
614,00:26:35.23,00:26:35.23, What was that?
615,00:26:36.30,00:26:36.30,"   ""Pagong Beach at sundown."""
616,00:26:38.47,00:26:38.47,"And ""What is the immunity challenge?"""
617,00:26:40.67,00:26:40.67,We get no clues.
618,00:26:42.00,00:26:42.00,It's tonight at Pagong Beach at sundown.
619,00:26:44.07,00:26:44.07,"That's pretty cool, though."
620,00:26:53.47,00:26:53.47, JEFF:    This island is Rich with    tradition and superstition.
621,00:26:57.20,00:26:57.20,"  Talk to the locals,   they'll tell you one thing--"
622,00:27:00.67,00:27:00.67," disrespect the jungle,    you pay the price."
623,00:27:03.47,00:27:03.47,Today's challenge deals   with jungle spirits.
624,00:27:06.10,00:27:06.10, Each survivor will be  given a video camera
625,00:27:08.67,00:27:08.67, and will race into the jungle     in search of five masks.
626,00:27:11.60,00:27:11.60, Behind each one is a question  about island folklore.
627,00:27:14.67,00:27:14.67, The castaways    will use the camera
628,00:27:16.40,00:27:16.40,to record themselves giving the answers and then take the mask.
629,00:27:20.07,00:27:20.07, The first one     to collect all the masks
630,00:27:22.23,00:27:22.23,  and answer all five    questions correctly on tape
631,00:27:25.53,00:27:25.53,will appease the jungle spirits     and win immunity.
632,00:27:31.20,00:27:31.20,  Everything I'm about   to tell you is true.
633,00:27:33.27,00:27:33.27,Malaysian custom says that sacrificing a goat
634,00:27:36.07,00:27:36.07,can bring about good luck.
635,00:27:37.60,00:27:37.60, So the locals seek out
636,00:27:38.97,00:27:38.97, the largest Banyan tree   they can find
637,00:27:41.07,00:27:41.07,and a high priestess makes the sacrifice.
638,00:27:46.80,00:27:46.80,This is how you protect yourself in the jungle.
639,00:27:49.23,00:27:49.23,The one thing you want to do to protect yourself is
640,00:27:50.83,00:27:50.83,never call out somebody's name.
641,00:27:52.53,00:27:52.53,"According to legend,"
642,00:27:53.87,00:27:53.87,"if you call out someone's name, the tree spirits"
643,00:27:56.07,00:27:56.07,Ncan grab that name and literally repeat that name  later.
644,00:27:59.03,00:27:59.03,  So you're out on your own
645,00:28:00.73,00:28:00.73,"  and you hear somebody say   your name-- ""I'm over here."""
646,00:28:03.50,00:28:03.50, So you start going this way.
647,00:28:05.20,00:28:05.20,So what you have to do if this happens--
648,00:28:06.77,00:28:06.77,"you got a piece of vine,   you make a circle out of it,"
649,00:28:09.40,00:28:09.40,"  you step through the circle,"
650,00:28:10.80,00:28:10.80,you say your own name
651,00:28:12.23,00:28:12.23,and you reclaim your name.
652,00:28:18.40,00:28:18.40," Every Tribal Council   I say, ""Fire represents life."
653,00:28:22.03,00:28:22.03,"  Your identity is    represented by your fire."""
654,00:28:24.87,00:28:24.87,"Since the merger, every person voted off the island"
655,00:28:27.13,00:28:27.13,has had their torch mysteriously blown out by the wind.
656,00:28:30.93,00:28:30.93,"And without anyone noticing,"
657,00:28:32.87,00:28:32.87,we had to re-light it so it could be
658,00:28:35.37,00:28:35.37,ceremoniously snuffed out instead.
659,00:28:39.40,00:28:39.40,"Also at Tribal Council,"
660,00:28:41.20,00:28:41.20,   I started blowing    this conch shell.
661,00:28:43.07,00:28:43.07,"Okay. Folklore says that the headhunters, when they would"
662,00:28:46.03,00:28:46.03,"come back from their headhunting,"
663,00:28:47.53,00:28:47.53,they would blow the conch shell
664,00:28:49.23,00:28:49.23,  and the rain gods   would release a storm
665,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17, to cleanse them     of all their sins
666,00:28:52.53,00:28:52.53,that they had committed for the people that they had beheaded.
667,00:28:55.53,00:28:55.53,What has happened at every Tribal Council?
668,00:28:57.53,00:28:57.53,It's rained.
669,00:29:01.73,00:29:01.73,The last thing is probably the most beautiful thing
670,00:29:04.60,00:29:04.60,"about island life, involves snakes."
671,00:29:06.47,00:29:06.47,The truth is that when a snake
672,00:29:08.13,00:29:08.13,"   comes to your camp, it is actually bringing you good luck."
673,00:29:11.07,00:29:11.07," If you treat the snake  with respect,"
674,00:29:12.80,00:29:12.80,"  it will bring you good luck,  but if you disrespect"
675,00:29:15.27,00:29:15.27,"or taunt a snake, it'll bring you bad luck."
676,00:29:18.97,00:29:18.97,Joel can attest to that.
677,00:29:21.00,00:29:21.00," He chased a pit viper    away from the Pagong camp,"
678,00:29:23.33,00:29:23.33, his fate was sealed.
679,00:29:24.40,00:29:24.40,  Later that night
680,00:29:25.40,00:29:25.40, Joel was voted off the island.
681,00:29:26.93,00:29:26.93,The most important thing right now is
682,00:29:29.10,00:29:29.10,"if you have listened carefully,"
683,00:29:31.00,00:29:31.00,I've given you everything you need to know
684,00:29:32.90,00:29:32.90,to win tonight's immunity challenge.
685,00:29:34.80,00:29:34.80,Take a camera
686,00:29:36.90,00:29:36.90,   and pass it down.
687,00:29:38.40,00:29:38.40,Your immunity challenge tonight is to go into the jungle
688,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,and there you'll find
689,00:29:42.13,00:29:42.13,five masks for each one of you.
690,00:29:43.83,00:29:43.83,Behind each mask is a question.
691,00:29:45.87,00:29:45.87,"Take the video camera, point it at yourself,"
692,00:29:47.93,00:29:47.93,record the answer.
693,00:29:49.53,00:29:49.53," When you're finished, take the mask with you."
694,00:29:52.03,00:29:52.03,  First one back with all the  correct answers wins immunity.
695,00:29:55.13,00:29:55.13,  Let's do it.
696,00:30:01.57,00:30:01.57,This is for immunity.
697,00:30:03.30,00:30:03.30,"Win this, you're going to the final four."
698,00:30:08.67,00:30:08.67,Survivors ready?
699,00:30:10.20,00:30:10.20,Go!

705,00:30:44.57,00:30:44.57,"Don't taunt it, don't do   anything to it. That's one."
706,00:30:56.33,00:30:56.33, I don't know.
707,00:30:58.43,00:30:58.43,"""What will the sprits do when they hear the conch shell?"""
708,00:31:03.73,00:31:03.73,"They'll cause it to rain  to cleanse the, uh..."

710,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30, Okay.
711,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,  Uh... say your name
712,00:31:29.53,00:31:29.53,and step through a hoop in vines.
713,00:31:31.23,00:31:31.23, Say your name  and it will be all cleared up.

725,00:32:40.77,00:32:40.77,Do you have all the answers?
726,00:32:42.27,00:32:42.27,Sure do.
727,00:32:43.40,00:32:43.40,Yeah? Let me see it.
728,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17, Four for four.
729,00:32:50.80,00:32:50.80,   Last one.
730,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,I guess you get to keep this.
731,00:32:56.53,00:32:56.53,There you go.
732,00:32:57.70,00:32:57.70," SUSAN: Good job, Kelly."
733,00:32:58.87,00:32:58.87,"Nice job, Wiglesworth."
734,00:33:00.07,00:33:00.07,Congratulations.
735,00:33:01.13,00:33:01.13," Thanks, guys."
736,00:33:40.70,00:33:40.70, SUSAN:   The rain's coming sideways.
737,00:33:42.70,00:33:42.70,"If it was coming straight down,"
738,00:33:44.40,00:33:44.40,   we'd be over by the fire    underneath the parachute.
739,00:33:46.50,00:33:46.50,"That would be good over there, eh, Rudy?"
740,00:33:49.53,00:33:49.53, RUDY: Yeah. Parachute might blow away.
741,00:33:52.07,00:33:52.07," SUSAN: I hope it's just   an afternoon of this, Rudy."
742,00:33:54.40,00:33:54.40,I hope it's not raining tonight
743,00:33:55.90,00:33:55.90,when we got to march up to tribal.
744,00:33:57.33,00:33:57.33,I don't know how Sean could sit up there.
745,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,Thought he had enough of it.
746,00:34:02.70,00:34:02.70,Cold and hungry.
747,00:34:03.97,00:34:03.97,I'm winning this thing.
748,00:34:05.47,00:34:05.47,"   You know, it's going to be an uphill battle for me,"
749,00:34:07.30,00:34:07.30,  but I'm winning this thing-- the whole show.
750,00:34:15.73,00:34:15.73,"RICHARD:   So we're back to...    where we were, eh?"
751,00:34:19.07,00:34:19.07,We were just talking
752,00:34:20.87,00:34:20.87,about whether it's Sean or Rudy.
753,00:34:23.53,00:34:23.53," RUDY:  Myself and, uh, Rich"
754,00:34:26.50,00:34:26.50,  are going right to the end.
755,00:34:29.03,00:34:29.03," You know, we hope that   it will be us two in the end"
756,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,where the jury picks one of us.
757,00:34:34.43,00:34:34.43,Yeah. It should be an interesting council.
758,00:34:36.60,00:34:36.60,Mm-hmm.
759,00:34:37.70,00:34:37.70,RICHARD:  The balance of power
760,00:34:39.33,00:34:39.33,"  I don't believe has shifted     from me to Kelly,"
761,00:34:41.53,00:34:41.53, but certainly I've lost   some footing.
762,00:34:44.87,00:34:44.87,"  Kelly wins immunity, and all kinds of things"
763,00:34:47.53,00:34:47.53, have to change    and shift quickly.
764,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,  So it's not as easy    to remain a solid alliance
765,00:34:52.77,00:34:52.77, in the midst of a lot of flux
766,00:34:55.77,00:34:55.77,  with so few people.
767,00:34:57.93,00:34:57.93, KELLY:  Rich has said--
768,00:34:59.13,00:34:59.13, since he knows  that Sue was plotting
769,00:35:00.67,00:35:00.67,   an alliance against him--
770,00:35:01.97,00:35:01.97, he has had to rearrange   his strategy.
771,00:35:05.53,00:35:05.53," So, maybe they're not     voting together."
772,00:35:07.50,00:35:07.50, I don't know.
773,00:35:09.23,00:35:09.23,"To me, that just means game on."
774,00:35:28.87,00:35:28.87," SEAN:   I think I've always   looked at it,"
775,00:35:31.40,00:35:31.40,"  the next Tribal Council,"
776,00:35:33.10,00:35:33.10," there'll be, you know,    a lot of votes cast"
777,00:35:35.43,00:35:35.43,in different directions
778,00:35:36.90,00:35:36.90,   that were never previously   cast before.
779,00:35:38.57,00:35:38.57,  I think the three people that are likely to vote for Sue
780,00:35:42.40,00:35:42.40," are me, Richard   and potentially Rudy."
781,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,  Rudy's kind of swinging.
782,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,   Rudy wants to...    wanted me whacked
783,00:35:49.13,00:35:49.13," about three weeks ago,"
784,00:35:50.77,00:35:50.77,"  so, you know...     he's a good guy."
785,00:35:52.23,00:35:52.23,"  We sleep together, but he's  ready to slit my throat"
786,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10,in this contest any minute now.
787,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,Behind...
788,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07, KELLY:    I'm going to vote  for either Rich or Sue.
789,00:36:03.77,00:36:03.77, Um... it's time to get dirty.
790,00:36:06.63,00:36:06.63, No more Mr. Nice Guy.
791,00:36:08.07,00:36:08.07," I... as I said, I don't know."
792,00:36:10.40,00:36:10.40,  It's every man for himself.
793,00:36:53.20,00:36:53.20,JEFF: Grab a seat.
794,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,   I'll bring in the jury...
795,00:36:56.53,00:36:56.53,which is growing.
796,00:36:58.40,00:36:58.40,"Now, Greg, Jenna,"
797,00:37:01.33,00:37:01.33,"Gervase, Colleen."
798,00:37:04.13,00:37:04.13,They'll take a seat here to observe.
799,00:37:06.30,00:37:06.30,One of you will be joining this group tonight.
800,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,The other four will be moving on.
801,00:37:10.73,00:37:10.73,   Tribal Council number 12.
802,00:37:12.47,00:37:12.47,"This is big tonight,"
803,00:37:14.83,00:37:14.83,"because if you make it through this vote,"
804,00:37:16.80,00:37:16.80,you make it to the final four.
805,00:37:18.43,00:37:18.43,Obviously the only person here doesn't have to worry tonight--
806,00:37:21.30,00:37:21.30,Kelly Wiglesworth.
807,00:37:22.90,00:37:22.90,"  Kelly, how much did you need  to win that immunity?"
808,00:37:26.37,00:37:26.37,   Desperately. Desperately.
809,00:37:28.70,00:37:28.70,  You're convinced you    were gone if not?
810,00:37:30.53,00:37:30.53,"   Pretty much, yeah."
811,00:37:31.97,00:37:31.97,"   In the situation    we're in tonight,"
812,00:37:33.37,00:37:33.37,"  as a result,   you go from somebody"
813,00:37:34.73,00:37:34.73,who might well have been voted off
814,00:37:36.23,00:37:36.23,to the absolute swing vote.
815,00:37:38.03,00:37:38.03,"You can't be voted on,"
816,00:37:39.33,00:37:39.33,but you're going to vote for somebody.
817,00:37:41.57,00:37:41.57,Indeed.
818,00:37:43.00,00:37:43.00,Did the mood around you  change at all in the last day?
819,00:37:45.47,00:37:45.47,"   I'd say so, yeah."
820,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50," I think the mood, you know..."
821,00:37:48.73,00:37:48.73,pretty much everybody with the whole group
822,00:37:50.93,00:37:50.93,and the new dynamics
823,00:37:52.80,00:37:52.80,  and three days left has changed quite a bit.
824,00:37:57.53,00:37:57.53,"JEFF: What about you, Rich?"
825,00:37:59.77,00:37:59.77,   What do you think    the take is on you
826,00:38:01.30,00:38:01.30,from the American public  point of view.
827,00:38:03.37,00:38:03.37," Hopefully, the people    who watch the show"
828,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33, would see somebody who's kind of known what he was looking for
829,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,"from the beginning, and has kind of"
830,00:38:10.93,00:38:10.93,worked toward his goal
831,00:38:13.27,00:38:13.27,   as ethically as he   could do it.
832,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,"JEFF: Rudy, you been around a long time."
833,00:38:16.53,00:38:16.53, You're definitely the veteran  of this group.
834,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,You're flying low
835,00:38:20.50,00:38:20.50,under the radar.
836,00:38:21.77,00:38:21.77,   What do you think
837,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,people are saying about you at this point?
838,00:38:24.93,00:38:24.93," Well, I know the whole Atlantic fleet is saying"
839,00:38:27.27,00:38:27.27,"  ""What's that old son of a... doing in there?"""
840,00:38:30.07,00:38:30.07,"   You know, and, uh,"
841,00:38:31.20,00:38:31.20,I'll have to answer 'em when I get back.
842,00:38:34.10,00:38:34.10,"   Do you think your buddies  are going, ""Go, Rudy!"""
843,00:38:35.87,00:38:35.87,"Or, ""I can't wait to see  this guy...?"""
844,00:38:37.47,00:38:37.47,"Oh, yeah, yeah.    They're behind me."
845,00:38:40.40,00:38:40.40,   They'd better be.
846,00:38:41.57,00:38:41.57,Even after you said you liked the homo?
847,00:38:43.30,00:38:43.30,Huh?
848,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"That's a good question, though."
849,00:38:45.93,00:38:45.93," You've made a couple of jokes,   you know, that Rich"
850,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,"is definitely a friend,"
851,00:38:49.20,00:38:49.20,but you wouldn't want to be seen with him
852,00:38:50.83,00:38:50.83,around your buddies.
853,00:38:52.40,00:38:52.40,"  When we're done with this,   I'm going to shake his hand"
854,00:38:54.37,00:38:54.37,and hope I never see you again.
855,00:38:55.80,00:38:55.80,That's it.
856,00:38:57.87,00:38:57.87,   Is there a sense of dread
857,00:38:58.97,00:38:58.97,coming over you guys
858,00:39:00.37,00:39:00.37,"that, you know, this whole idea"
859,00:39:02.27,00:39:02.27,of the alliance now has to be reckoned with?
860,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,Actions come into play.
861,00:39:05.97,00:39:05.97," At one point,"
862,00:39:06.97,00:39:06.97,"whether it was happenstance or not,"
863,00:39:08.70,00:39:08.70,Pagong members were voted off one by one.
864,00:39:10.57,00:39:10.57,Now they're sitting across from you
865,00:39:12.60,00:39:12.60,"ready to say, ""Now it's my turn."""
866,00:39:14.93,00:39:14.93,"   How's that sittin' with you, Sean?"
867,00:39:16.27,00:39:16.27,It's sitting fine with me.
868,00:39:17.73,00:39:17.73,"I think the people that got to know me,"
869,00:39:19.67,00:39:19.67,got to understand me
870,00:39:20.80,00:39:20.80,and know where I'm coming from...
871,00:39:22.27,00:39:22.27,"But, you know, like I said"
872,00:39:23.97,00:39:23.97,I've conducted myself in a different manner
873,00:39:25.90,00:39:25.90,"than everybody, you know-- unique."
874,00:39:28.10,00:39:28.10,"Uh, was it smart? I don't know."
875,00:39:30.10,00:39:30.10,Did it make me feel good? Absolutely.
876,00:39:32.40,00:39:32.40,"Yeah. I mean, I'm very comfortable"
877,00:39:33.87,00:39:33.87,with them judging me at this point.
878,00:39:35.57,00:39:35.57,JEFF: Last question-- Sue:
879,00:39:37.63,00:39:37.63,  At one point   you said early on...
880,00:39:39.10,00:39:39.10,"   I think, in fact,  it might have been to Rich..."
881,00:39:40.93,00:39:40.93,I'm not sure.
882,00:39:42.67,00:39:42.67,"   One of the first few days    here, you said, ""Listen--"
883,00:39:44.73,00:39:44.73,"""I'm just a redneck and corporate America"
884,00:39:46.23,00:39:46.23,"isn't going to play here."""
885,00:39:47.30,00:39:47.30,"RICHARD: Oh, she sure did."
886,00:39:48.60,00:39:48.60,"But just a couple of Tribal Councils ago,"
887,00:39:50.13,00:39:50.13,  you made a pretty good case
888,00:39:51.43,00:39:51.43,  for the fact  that what goes on here
889,00:39:52.93,00:39:52.93,  at Survivor   is really no different
890,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37,than what goes on in corporate America.
891,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37,"Oh, yeah."
892,00:39:56.77,00:39:56.77,   So my question is    what has won out--
893,00:39:58.50,00:39:58.50,"   simple Midwestern values,   or the harsh reality"
894,00:40:00.73,00:40:00.73,of corporate life?
895,00:40:02.00,00:40:02.00,"It ain't over with yet,"
896,00:40:03.63,00:40:03.63," so you can't say who's won out yet, eh?"
897,00:40:06.27,00:40:06.27,The idea of money--
898,00:40:08.17,00:40:08.17,money makes the world go round.
899,00:40:09.73,00:40:09.73,"Money is greed, money is what everybody thrives for."
900,00:40:12.50,00:40:12.50,I don't care what anybody says anymore.
901,00:40:15.33,00:40:15.33,   Um... it's what spins us.
902,00:40:18.67,00:40:18.67,It can make life a little bit easier.
903,00:40:20.87,00:40:20.87,"If you're, you know, struggling,"
904,00:40:22.20,00:40:22.20,"or whatever,"
905,00:40:23.20,00:40:23.20,it helps.
906,00:40:24.73,00:40:24.73,"  Big fights, divorces happen over shortages of money,"
907,00:40:27.80,00:40:27.80," so... a lot to be said    about money, Jeff."
908,00:40:30.17,00:40:30.17,That's what we're talking about.
909,00:40:32.33,00:40:32.33,On that note...
910,00:40:33.80,00:40:33.80,   it's time to vote.
911,00:40:34.80,00:40:34.80,Rich.
912,00:40:46.20,00:40:46.20,  I'm voting for Sue tonight.
913,00:40:47.57,00:40:47.57, Not for any particular reason.
914,00:40:49.33,00:40:49.33,  She's a good friend of mine
915,00:40:50.83,00:40:50.83,"   and will always be  a good friend of mine,"
916,00:40:52.67,00:40:52.67,  but it's a self-   preservation maneuver
917,00:40:55.23,00:40:55.23,"  and, uh, needed to be done."
918,00:41:07.73,00:41:07.73,  It was fun.
919,00:41:09.37,00:41:09.37,"   Good luck, buddy."
920,00:41:16.20,00:41:16.20,   Fire definitely represents   life on the island.
921,00:41:19.23,00:41:19.23,"Across from you now, 11 staffs."
922,00:41:23.40,00:41:23.40,Another one will be added
923,00:41:24.90,00:41:24.90,to that group tonight.
924,00:41:26.53,00:41:26.53,Four of you will move on.
925,00:41:28.33,00:41:28.33,I'll go tally the votes.
926,00:41:49.60,00:41:49.60,"  Once the votes are tallied,  the decision is final"
927,00:41:52.93,00:41:52.93,  and the person will be asked to leave the island immediately.
928,00:41:55.60,00:41:55.60,I'll read the votes.
929,00:42:03.90,00:42:03.90,"""Sue."""
930,00:42:10.40,00:42:10.40,"""Sean."""
931,00:42:15.57,00:42:15.57,"""Sean."""
932,00:42:21.93,00:42:21.93,"""Sean."""
933,00:42:23.00,00:42:23.00,You need to bring me your torch.
934,00:42:29.93,00:42:29.93,Maybe the jungle    is speaking to us.
935,00:42:32.60,00:42:32.60,SEAN: Wow... someone snuck up behind me. Come on.
936,00:42:36.13,00:42:36.13,It went out during the vote.
937,00:42:37.37,00:42:37.37,No...
938,00:42:38.77,00:42:38.77,"The tribe has spoken, the jungle has spoken."
939,00:42:40.50,00:42:40.50,It's time for you to go.
940,00:42:42.63,00:42:42.63,  I'll see you in a few days.
941,00:42:44.17,00:42:44.17,Good-bye.
942,00:42:58.00,00:42:58.00, JEFF:  Sean's torch went out
943,00:42:59.90,00:42:59.90,   during the Tribal Council.
944,00:43:01.47,00:43:01.47,"Since the merger,"
945,00:43:03.07,00:43:03.07,every person voted off
946,00:43:05.17,00:43:05.17,  has had their torch go out.
947,00:43:06.63,00:43:06.63,You guys have made it to the final four.
948,00:43:08.20,00:43:08.20,"We'll have a final Tribal Council,"
949,00:43:10.03,00:43:10.03,where the jury will decide who leaves this island
950,00:43:12.87,00:43:12.87,with a lot of bragging rights
951,00:43:15.40,00:43:15.40,   and a lot of cash.
952,00:43:16.93,00:43:16.93,   You can head back to camp.
953,00:43:18.83,00:43:18.83,I'll see you tomorrow.

956,00:43:46.43,00:43:46.43,I like to think I was the last good person down.
957,00:43:48.73,00:43:48.73,I hope that's the way America remembers me.
958,00:43:50.80,00:43:50.80, I conducted myself  very well here.

960,00:43:55.67,00:43:55.67, but there are some very
