597,00:29:54.83,00:29:54.83,>> I PERSONALLY THINKWE SHOULD VOTE BENRY OUT FIRST.

601,00:30:02.88,00:30:02.88,BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE NUMBERSTO DO IT.

607,00:30:30.33,00:30:30.33,>> WE'RE TRYINGTO VOTE BRENDA OUT TONIGHT.
608,00:30:33.75,00:30:33.75,AND ME AND YOU COULD MAKEA HUGE POWER MOVE.
609,00:30:35.92,00:30:35.92,AND IT'S GONNA BE SO EASYTO GET PEOPLE TO TURN ON HER.
610,00:30:38.75,00:30:38.75,>> I KNOW. >> BECAUSETHEY SEE HER AS A THREAT.
611,00:30:40.42,00:30:40.42,">> IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED MEA FEW DAYS AGO,"
612,00:30:42.92,00:30:42.92,I'D SAY THAT BRENDA HELD A LOTOF CARDS IN THIS GAME.
613,00:30:47.08,00:30:47.08,"BUT NOW,TIDES HAVE TURNED A LITTLE BIT,"
614,00:30:50.08,00:30:50.08,AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIMEIN THE GAME
615,00:30:52.62,00:30:52.62,THAT I'M STARTINGTO WORRY A LITTLE BIT.
616,00:30:54.88,00:30:54.88,">> YOU'RE COMING TO ME STRAIGHT,RIGHT? >> YEAH."
617,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,">> SO, WHAT DO YOU THINKABOUT THE WHOLE THING?"
618,00:31:12.92,00:31:12.92,>> I DON'T KNOW.I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
619,00:31:14.75,00:31:14.75,'CAUSE I'VE TRIED TO...I'VE SAT BACK AND NOT REALLY...
620,00:31:17.33,00:31:17.33,>> I JUST THINK BRENDA'S BEENTHE RING LEADER.
621,00:31:19.62,00:31:19.62,>> SHE WAS THE RING LEADEROVER AT YOUR CAMP. >> YEAH.
622,00:31:21.21,00:31:21.21,>> SHE'S THE RING LEADER HERE.SHE'S JUST...
623,00:31:23.00,00:31:23.00,"SHE'S GOT EVERYBODY ON HER LIST,"
624,00:31:24.21,00:31:24.21,AND THAT'S HOWTHEY'RE GOING TO GO.
625,00:31:25.42,00:31:25.42,"SO, THAT'S HOW I FEEL."
626,00:31:27.88,00:31:27.88,>> YEAH. I'VE BEEN PLAYINGTHIS GAME WITH MY HEART

628,00:31:32.33,00:31:32.33,AND IT ABSOLUTELY KILLS ME THATI MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE BRENDA OUT.
629,00:31:35.71,00:31:35.71,I DON'T TRUST BENRY.
630,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,I DON'T TRUST HOLLYALL THAT MUCH.
631,00:31:39.88,00:31:39.88,DAN-- I DON'T REALLY TRUST HIM.
632,00:31:41.50,00:31:41.50,NAY-- I DON'T TRUST HER ANYMORE.
633,00:31:43.12,00:31:43.12,"SO, IF BRENDA'S GONE,"
634,00:31:45.21,00:31:45.21,I'M PLAYING THE GAME WITH PEOPLETHAT I DON'T REALLY TRUST.
635,00:31:47.42,00:31:47.42,THAT'S A...THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT.
636,00:31:57.92,00:31:57.92,>> A LOT OF PEOPLEARE SAYING YOU.
637,00:32:00.00,00:32:00.00,I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'SANY NUMBERS TO SAVE YOU.
638,00:32:03.21,00:32:03.21,THE THING THAT CHANGED WAS NAY.
639,00:32:04.71,00:32:04.71,>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?NAY'S NOT GONNA VOTE FOR ME.
640,00:32:08.92,00:32:08.92,>> NAY SWEARSSHE'S VOTING FOR YOU.
641,00:32:10.58,00:32:10.58,NAY WAS... NAY'S THE ONETHAT SCREWED IT UP.
642,00:32:12.54,00:32:12.54,IT SURE AS HELL WASN'T MY IDEA.
643,00:32:15.04,00:32:15.04,>> HMM.
644,00:32:16.88,00:32:16.88,IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS OPERATIONTAKE-OUT-BRENDA IN PLACE.
645,00:32:21.12,00:32:21.12,"I'M PRETTY ANNOYED ABOUT IT,"
646,00:32:22.96,00:32:22.96,BUT I THINKALL I CAN DO IS STAY COOL.
647,00:32:25.58,00:32:25.58,THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO ISSTART SCRAMBLING.
648,00:32:27.96,00:32:27.96,IT JUST SHOWSTHAT YOU'RE DESPERATE.
649,00:32:29.75,00:32:29.75,"SO, YOU KNOW,IF I SHOW CONFIDENCE,"
650,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,MY FRIENDSHAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME.
651,00:32:34.29,00:32:34.29,"IT SHOWS THAT, YEAH, I KIND OFWANT TO STICK WITH BRENDA."
652,00:32:37.12,00:32:37.12,>> TELL HER WHO MESSEDTHE FIVE OF US FIRST?

655,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,>> SHE WANTS YOU OUT.
656,00:32:43.29,00:32:43.29,">> I TRUSTED HER 1,000%.>> ME, TOO."
657,00:32:45.92,00:32:45.92,">> BUT THEN, NOW WHAT?"
658,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOINGTO BE LOYAL TO YOU.
659,00:32:49.12,00:32:49.12,"THEY SAW THE ALLIANCE, AND NOWTHEY'RE BREAKING IT, THOUGH,"
660,00:32:52.29,00:32:52.29,"SO, YOU THINKTHEY'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU?"
661,00:33:05.62,00:33:05.62,>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

664,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,"BECAUSE IF I GET VOTED OUTTONIGHT,"
665,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,THERE'S NO WAYYOU CAN GET THE NUMBERS BACK.
666,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,>> THE IDOL IS DEFINITELYSOMETHING TO BE USED
667,00:33:18.54,00:33:18.54,"TO NOT ONLY TO PROTECT YOURSELF,"
668,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,BUT ALSO SOMEONEWITHIN YOUR ALLIANCE.
669,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,MY GOAL WOULD BE TO NEVERHAVE TO USE IT AT ALL.
670,00:33:25.12,00:33:25.12,"HOWEVER, AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,THE MOMENT CAME UP"
671,00:33:29.00,00:33:29.00,"WHERE I NEEDED TO USE ITTO SAVE BRENDA,"
672,00:33:31.71,00:33:31.71,I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDERVERY STRONGLY DOING THAT.
673,00:33:37.46,00:33:37.46,>> YOU DON'T THINK SASH IS GOINGTO GIVE BRENDA THE IDOL?
674,00:33:39.12,00:33:39.12,">> HELL, NO."
675,00:33:40.75,00:33:40.75,>> I'M JUST FURIOUS THAT NAONKAWOULD MAKE SUCH A DUMB MOVE.
676,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,I THOUGHTWE HAD A GREAT ALLIANCE.
677,00:33:46.42,00:33:46.42,I REALLY BELIEVEDTHAT WE WOULD GO TO THE END.
678,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEENAONKA'S FACE.
679,00:33:51.38,00:33:51.38,"I WANTED TO TAKE OUT BENRY,"
680,00:33:53.75,00:33:53.75,"BUT, HOPEFULLY, SASH IS GOINGTO GIVE ME HIS IMMUNITY IDOL,"
681,00:33:56.88,00:33:56.88,AND WE BLINDSIDE NAONKA.
682,00:34:13.88,00:34:13.88,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRINGIN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
683,00:34:19.62,00:34:19.62,"ALINA AND MARTY, VOTED OUTAT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL."
684,00:34:26.29,00:34:26.29,"SASH, WERE YOU SURPRISED"
685,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,AT THE LAST VOTEWHEN MARTY WAS SENT HOME?
686,00:34:30.12,00:34:30.12,">> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLEWERE SURPRISED,"
687,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,"BUT SINCETHE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
688,00:34:34.12,00:34:34.12,"THERE'S BEEN A LOTOF RESHUFFLING IN THE TRIBE,"
689,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,"AND SO, I THINKI'M MORE OUT OF THE LOOP NOW"
690,00:34:39.62,00:34:39.62,THAN I'VE BEENSINCE THE GAME STARTED.
691,00:34:41.88,00:34:41.88,>> Jeff: REALLY?>> UH-HUH.

693,00:34:44.79,00:34:44.79,SASH BELIEVESHE'S OUT OF THE LOOP?
694,00:34:46.83,00:34:46.83,">> I DO, BECAUSEHE HAD A STRONG ALLIANCE,"
695,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,AND NOW THAT STRONG ALLIANCESEEMS TO BE GO GONE.
696,00:34:52.25,00:34:52.25,">> Jeff: BRENDA, ANY REGRETSOVER THE LAST VOTE?"
697,00:34:54.71,00:34:54.71,>> YEAH. I DIDN'T WANTTO VOTE MARTY.
698,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,"ALL MY PEEPS KNOW IT,BUT I HAD TO PROVE SOMETHING"
699,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,TO PEOPLEWHO WERE IN MY ALLIANCE
700,00:35:02.38,00:35:02.38,THAT THEY COULD TRUST ME.
701,00:35:04.33,00:35:04.33,>> Jeff: HOW HARD IS IT FOR YOUTO TRUST PEOPLE OUT HERE?
702,00:35:07.25,00:35:07.25,>> NOT HARD.
703,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEMWITH THAT FROM THE START.
704,00:35:10.62,00:35:10.62,AND I THOUGHT
705,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,"THAT THERE WASA REALLY STRONG CORE ALLIANCE,"
706,00:35:15.83,00:35:15.83,THE STRONGEST ONEIN THIS WHOLE GAME.
707,00:35:17.75,00:35:17.75,I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.
708,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,AND IT LOOKS LIKEWHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS
709,00:35:21.67,00:35:21.67,THERE'S A BREAK IN THE ALLIANCE
710,00:35:23.33,00:35:23.33,"BECAUSE OFNAONKA WANTING TO JUMP SHIP,"
711,00:35:27.38,00:35:27.38,AND THIS ISTHE MOST SURPRISING THING
712,00:35:29.42,00:35:29.42,BECAUSE I WAS WORRIEDABOUT THESE GUYS RIGHT HERE.
713,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,"MEANWHILE, SHE'S THE ONETHAT WANTS TO GO."
714,00:35:36.54,00:35:36.54,">> Jeff: NAONKA, THAT'S A PRETTYSTRAIGHT-OUT ACCUSATION."

717,00:35:43.50,00:35:43.50,">> IT WAS NOT ME, OKAY?"
718,00:35:45.46,00:35:45.46,"EVERYBODY COULD PUT IT ON ME,BUT I'LL PUT IT LIKE THIS."
719,00:35:47.83,00:35:47.83,CHASE WAS RUNNING AROUNDYESTERDAY WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF.
720,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,IT'S SOMETHING THAT CHASE DOES.
721,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.HE WAS PARANOID.
722,00:35:55.62,00:35:55.62,">> Jeff: SO YOU'RE TELLINGBRENDA RIGHT NOW,"

734,00:36:23.29,00:36:23.29,I FELT COMPLETELYOUT OF THE LOOP
735,00:36:25.04,00:36:25.04,"ON WHAT'S GOING ON,TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST."

741,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,"LIKE, THIS... IT'S ENLIGHTENING."
742,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,">> Jeff: SO, BRENDA, YOU'VEHEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING."
743,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,NOW WHERE DO YOU SIT?WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?
744,00:36:42.00,00:36:42.00,>> WHY WOULD SASH BREAK UPTHE BEST ALLIANCE HERE
745,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,'CAUSE HE'S SO SMART?
746,00:36:47.38,00:36:47.38,AND WHY WOULD CHASE LET ME INON IT THE DAY BEFORE?
747,00:36:50.54,00:36:50.54,HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
748,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"SO THEN, IT MAKES SENSE THAT ITWAS NAONKA WANTING TO JUMP SHIP."
749,00:36:56.42,00:36:56.42,THAT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME.
750,00:36:58.17,00:36:58.17,">> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENS, SASH,IF YOU BREAK TRUST IN THIS GAME?"
751,00:37:00.88,00:37:00.88,WHAT DO YOU PUT AT RISK?

755,00:37:11.21,00:37:11.21,"I MADE IT TO THE MERGE,AND HOPEFULLY, THAT'S WHY"
756,00:37:13.29,00:37:13.29,I'LL STICK AROUNDFOR ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL.
757,00:37:15.38,00:37:15.38,">> Jeff: SO, BRENDA,DID YOU SCRAMBLE THIS AFTERNOON?"

763,00:37:28.92,00:37:28.92,MAYBE THEY WOULD SWITCH.

773,00:37:49.04,00:37:49.04,AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAYTO DO THINGS.
