3,00:00:04.46,00:00:04.46,SASH AND BRENDA WERE KING AND QUEEN OF THE BEACH.
4,00:00:07.46,00:00:07.46,>> WE'RE THE TWO MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN THIS GAME.
5,00:00:09.75,00:00:09.75,>> Jeff: AND THEY THOUGHT EVERYONE ELSE WAS A PEASANT.
6,00:00:12.12,00:00:12.12,>> PEOPLE NEED TO REMEMBER WHERE THEIR PLACE IS.
7,00:00:13.92,00:00:13.92,>> Jeff: THEIR ALLIANCE WAS STRENGTHENED
8,00:00:15.29,00:00:15.29,BY TWO HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS.
9,00:00:16.67,00:00:16.67,BRENDA'S BEST FRIEND NAONKA HAD ONE...
10,00:00:18.17,00:00:18.17,>> IT'S THE KEY TO OUR LIFE IN THE GAME.
11,00:00:20.42,00:00:20.42,>> Jeff: ...AND SASH HAD THE OTHER.
12,00:00:23.08,00:00:23.08,BUT SOME OF THE PEASANTS WERE GETTING RESTLESS.
13,00:00:25.54,00:00:25.54,>> THERE IS A TEMPTATION
14,00:00:26.96,00:00:26.96,TO WANT TO SUDDENLY JUST TAKE CONTROL AND MAKE A MOVE.
15,00:00:29.58,00:00:29.58,WHOO!
16,00:00:30.67,00:00:30.67,">> YEAH, MARTY!"

18,00:00:34.92,00:00:34.92,AND TRIED TO LAUNCH AN ALL-GUYS REBELLION.
19,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,">> WE'RE TAKING THIS THING TO THE END, MEN."
20,00:00:40.17,00:00:40.17,>> WE EARNED IT!
21,00:00:41.25,00:00:41.25,">> NICE JOB TODAY, MAN."
22,00:00:42.54,00:00:42.54,>> Jeff: FABIO AND BENRY IMMEDIATELY JUMPED ON BOARD.
23,00:00:45.50,00:00:45.50,>> MARTY'S A SMART GUY. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.
24,00:00:47.71,00:00:47.71,>> Jeff: SASH FOOLED MARTY
25,00:00:49.17,00:00:49.17,BY PRETENDING TO JOIN UP WITH HIM.
26,00:00:51.46,00:00:51.46,>> I TRIED TO BOOST HIS EGO
27,00:00:53.21,00:00:53.21,SO THAT HE'LL CONTINUE TO COME BACK TO ME.
28,00:00:56.38,00:00:56.38,>> Jeff: MARTY DIDN'T APPROACH CHASE BECAUSE HE WAS TOO CLOSE
29,00:00:59.42,00:00:59.42,WITH BRENDA AND JANE.
30,00:01:00.92,00:01:00.92,">> I WANTED TO SHOW THE GIRLS THEY CAN TRUST ME,"
31,00:01:03.88,00:01:03.88,AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GET ME FURTHER IN THE GAME.
32,00:01:07.08,00:01:07.08,">> Jeff: AT TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
33,00:01:08.75,00:01:08.75,BRENDA AND SASH SQUASHED MARTY'S PLAN...
34,00:01:11.25,00:01:11.25,"MARTY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
35,00:01:13.00,00:01:13.00,...AND MARTY ALONG WITH HIM.
36,00:01:14.54,00:01:14.54,NOW BRENDA AND SASH HAVE SO MUCH POWER
37,00:01:16.83,00:01:16.83,THAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDER.
38,00:01:19.29,00:01:19.29,TEN ARE LEFT. WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
39,00:01:32.17,00:01:32.17,>> TRIBAL COUNCIL REALLY SHOWED WHERE THE ALLEGIANCE REALLY IS.
40,00:01:38.00,00:01:38.00,"BENRY, FABIO, AND DAN NOW SEE"
41,00:01:42.54,00:01:42.54,THAT SASH AND I AREN'T ON THEIR SIDE.
42,00:01:46.88,00:01:46.88,AND WE TOOK OUT THEIR LITTLE LEADER MARTY.
43,00:01:49.83,00:01:49.83,AND NOW IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY GO.
44,00:01:52.08,00:01:52.08,I'M GONNA GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP TONIGHT.
45,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,">> OH, YEAH."
46,00:01:55.12,00:01:55.12,>> I THINK SASH AND I BEING IN CONTROL
47,00:01:58.25,00:01:58.25,DOES LOOK LIKE A KING- AND-QUEEN SITUATION.
48,00:02:01.12,00:02:01.12,BUT SASH IS MORE OF A QUEEN
49,00:02:02.92,00:02:02.92,AND I'M MORE OF A KING IS THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.
50,00:02:33.96,00:02:33.96,>> I KNOW.
51,00:02:35.17,00:02:35.17,>> JANE AND I BOTH HAD THE SAME FEELING:
52,00:02:37.08,00:02:37.08,BRENDA IS BASICALLY CALLING ALL THE SHOTS.
53,00:02:40.21,00:02:40.21,SO WE ARE TOTALLY GONNA MAKE A POWER MOVE BEFORE NEXT TRIBAL.
54,00:02:44.67,00:02:44.67,"I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOSE?"
55,00:02:47.00,00:02:47.00,"SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE, AND IT HAS TO CHANGE SOON."

57,00:03:58.12,00:03:58.12,">> THIS RAIN IS BAD, MAN."
58,00:04:00.38,00:04:00.38,THE ELEMENTS OUT HERE CAN REALLY GET YOU.
59,00:04:07.00,00:04:07.00,"THIS MORNING, WE WOKE UP, AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GONNA RAIN."
60,00:04:10.08,00:04:10.08,WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT
61,00:04:11.71,00:04:11.71,THAT THE FIRE AT LEAST STAYS GOING.
62,00:04:13.58,00:04:13.58,"SO WE MOVED, LIKE, ALL OF THE CHESTS AROUND THE FIRE"
63,00:04:17.29,00:04:17.29,TO PROTECT IT FROM THE RAIN. THAT'S IMPORTANT.
64,00:04:27.67,00:04:27.67,">> I GOT UP THREE TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,"
65,00:04:30.12,00:04:30.12,"AND I WAS GONNA WAKE YOU UP, AND THEN I DIDN'T."
66,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,>> I'VE COME A LONG WAY IN THIS GAME.
67,00:04:38.29,00:04:38.29,"DAY FIVE, I WAS READY TO LEAVE,"
68,00:04:41.29,00:04:41.29,"AND HERE I AM, SITTING HERE WITH 14 DAYS LEFT."
69,00:04:44.46,00:04:44.46,"I'M, LIKE, ""MY GOSH. I COULD REALLY KEEP GOING."""
70,00:04:48.42,00:04:48.42,"SO RIGHT NOW, JANE AND I, WE'RE TRYING TO RALLY A VOTE"
71,00:04:51.92,00:04:51.92,AGAINST BRENDA OR SASH.
72,00:04:53.42,00:04:53.42,>> WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
73,00:04:55.50,00:04:55.50,>> SASH AND BRENDA TOLD YOU GUYS THEY WERE VOTING FOR JANE.
74,00:04:59.29,00:04:59.29,>> RIGHT.
75,00:05:00.46,00:05:00.46,">> AND THEY SWITCHED, AND THEY VOTED FOR MARTY."
76,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,THEY ARE IN TOTAL CONTROL.
77,00:05:06.08,00:05:06.08,>> SASH JUST BACKSTABBED HIM LAST NIGHT.
78,00:05:08.88,00:05:08.88,>> TERRIBLY!
79,00:05:10.12,00:05:10.12,>> TERRIBLY.
80,00:05:11.17,00:05:11.17,>> SO HOW CAN YOU TRUST BRENDA AND SASH
81,00:05:13.79,00:05:13.79,WHEN WHAT THEY DID AT TRIBAL LAST NIGHT?
82,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17,>> I CAN'T.
83,00:05:17.62,00:05:17.62,">> EVERYBODY'S LISTENING TO BRENDA, INCLUDING ME."
84,00:05:20.12,00:05:20.12,KELLY PURPLE CRAWLS UP BRENDA'S ...
85,00:05:22.29,00:05:22.29,SHE DOES EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.
86,00:05:25.29,00:05:25.29,BRENDA IS ALSO ANOTHER THREAT
87,00:05:27.29,00:05:27.29,BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY GOOD AT CHALLENGES.
88,00:05:29.96,00:05:29.96,AND SHE'S GONNA TAKE YOU GUYS OUT ONE BY ONE.
89,00:05:32.58,00:05:32.58,>> HOLLY ABSOLUTELY GAVE ME
90,00:05:33.83,00:05:33.83,A LITTLE BIT OF A WAKE-UP CALL THIS MORNING.
91,00:05:36.29,00:05:36.29,"SHE'S GOT A GREAT PLAN, ACTUALLY."
92,00:05:37.71,00:05:37.71,"AND I'M ALL FOR IT, YOU KNOW?"
93,00:05:39.46,00:05:39.46,GETTING RID OF SASH AND BRENDA IS NUMBER ONE
94,00:05:41.38,00:05:41.38,ON MY LIST RIGHT NOW.
95,00:05:44.25,00:05:44.25,>> BRENDA'S THE QUEEN BEE AND KNOWS THIS GAME IN AND OUT.
96,00:05:48.75,00:05:48.75,SHE MUST HAVE BEEN STUDYING THIS FOREVER.
97,00:05:51.50,00:05:51.50,>> BRENDA IS PLAYING THIS GAME SO WELL
98,00:05:54.12,00:05:54.12,TO WHERE SHE'S OVER-THINKING.
99,00:05:56.00,00:05:56.00,"SHE'S MARTY, JR."
100,00:06:03.96,00:06:03.96,SHE'S BECOME A VILLAIN.
101,00:06:05.25,00:06:05.25,"SHE BEFRIENDS YOU, AND THEN SHE THROWS YOU TO THE WOLVES."
102,00:06:12.33,00:06:12.33,">> BRENDA, SHE'S LIKE MY BEST FRIEND OUT HERE,"
103,00:06:14.38,00:06:14.38,BUT DID I COME OUT HERE ALL THIS WAY FROM SOUTH CENTRAL L.A.
104,00:06:18.21,00:06:18.21,TO GO BACK HOME WITH NOTHING?
105,00:06:20.08,00:06:20.08,NO. THIS IS A GAME. AND BRENDA IS A THREAT.
106,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,"SO RIGHT NOW, WHILE WE HAVE EVERYBODY AGAINST HER,"
107,00:06:25.71,00:06:25.71,NOW IS THE TIME TO GET HER OUT.
108,00:06:29.12,00:06:29.12,">> WE NEED TO SEE WHO WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY,"
109,00:06:31.46,00:06:31.46,AND THEN WE NEED TO DECIDE.
110,00:06:33.08,00:06:33.08,BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL IN A CONSENSUS
111,00:06:35.08,00:06:35.08,THAT BRENDA HAS TO GO FIRST. SHE'S THE RINGLEADER.
112,00:06:38.21,00:06:38.21,>> THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE CRAZY HERE AT CAMP.
113,00:06:40.29,00:06:40.29,"THERE'S TWO ALLIANCES NOW,"
114,00:06:42.29,00:06:42.29,AND I PERSONALLY THINK IT COULD BE THE BEST INTEREST
115,00:06:45.04,00:06:45.04,TO VOTE BENRY OUT FIRST.
116,00:06:46.42,00:06:46.42,I STILL DON'T TRUST BENRY. BENRY'S ON HIS LAST ROPE.
117,00:06:49.71,00:06:49.71,"HE SCREWED UP WHEN HE VOTED WITH MARTY,"
118,00:06:52.29,00:06:52.29,PLUS HE'S A BIG PHYSICAL THREAT.
119,00:06:53.71,00:06:53.71,"AND AS OF RIGHT NOW,"
120,00:06:55.04,00:06:55.04,I DON'T THINK BRENDA AND SASH HAVE LIED TO ME.
121,00:06:57.21,00:06:57.21,SO I'M STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO ALLIANCES AGAIN.
122,00:06:59.46,00:06:59.46,">> CHASE, YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME ON THIS ONE."
123,00:07:01.54,00:07:01.54,SHE IS TOTALLY RUNNING THE SHOW.
124,00:07:10.04,00:07:10.04,>> I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.
125,00:07:11.88,00:07:11.88,CHASE WAS A LITTLE LEERY ABOUT THE PLAN.
126,00:07:14.12,00:07:14.12,HE WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT BEN.
127,00:07:17.00,00:07:17.00,"SO I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON CHASE JUST BECAUSE CHASE,"
128,00:07:20.62,00:07:20.62,"I FEEL I CAN TRUST HIM,"
129,00:07:22.25,00:07:22.25,"BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,"
130,00:07:24.29,00:07:24.29,HE MAKES ME JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS.
131,00:07:34.08,00:07:34.08,">> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!"
132,00:07:42.50,00:07:42.50,GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S REWARD CHALLENGE?

246,00:12:30.96,00:12:30.96,THE HEAT COMING UP BETWEEN YOU AND THE GROUND.

252,00:12:45.25,00:12:45.25,EVEN HEARD OF THAT BEFORE.
253,00:12:47.08,00:12:47.08,"THAT BLEW MY MIND, DUDE."
254,00:12:49.21,00:12:49.21,(indistinct yelling)

267,00:13:58.21,00:13:58.21,"AND THAT'S WHAT IT WAS LIKE, RIDING A LITTLE BULL."
268,00:14:00.58,00:14:00.58,IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE I'LL NEVER FORGET.
269,00:14:04.12,00:14:04.12,>> WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK'S GOING DOWN AT CAMP.
270,00:14:05.79,00:14:05.79,>> I DON'T CARE.

275,00:14:57.29,00:14:57.29,>> EVERYTHING BURNED.
276,00:14:58.29,00:14:58.29,>> ALL OF IT?
277,00:14:59.29,00:14:59.29,">> OH, MY GOD!"

280,00:15:06.29,00:15:06.29,>> LOOK AT THE MACHETES.
281,00:15:07.25,00:15:07.25,>> HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
282,00:15:10.83,00:15:10.83,">> NOT ONLY DID WE LOSE REWARD CHALLENGE, BUT WE JUST GOT BACK"
283,00:15:15.08,00:15:15.08,"TO CAMP, AND PRETTY MUCH OUR ENTIRE CAMP JUST BURNED DOWN."
284,00:15:20.17,00:15:20.17,"OH, MY GOD."
285,00:15:24.21,00:15:24.21,THIS IS UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE.
286,00:15:28.12,00:15:28.12,WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THIS DAMN FIRE GOING DAY IN AND DAY OUT.
287,00:15:31.12,00:15:31.12,WE LEFT AND IT WAS RAINING SO WE CREATED A LITTLE BARRICADE
288,00:15:35.12,00:15:35.12,"WITH OUR THREE CHESTS, WOODEN CHESTS, ONE OF WHICH HAD"
289,00:15:39.08,00:15:39.08,ALL THE REST OF OUR FOOD IN IT.
290,00:15:41.08,00:15:41.08,">> YOU GUYS, DID WE REALLY BUILD THAT FIRE UP THAT BIG?"
291,00:15:43.21,00:15:43.21,>> YEAH.
292,00:15:44.25,00:15:44.25,>> LOOK HOW HOT IT WAS.
293,00:15:45.21,00:15:45.21,LOOK HOW THE GLASS MELTED.
294,00:15:46.83,00:15:46.83,">> OH, MY GOD."
295,00:15:48.38,00:15:48.38,>> WE'RE LUCKY THE WHOLE THING DIDN'T BURN DOWN.
296,00:15:50.17,00:15:50.17,>> WE LOST ALL OUR MACHETES.
297,00:15:51.96,00:15:51.96,ONLY THE BLADES ARE LEFT.
298,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,WE HAD OUR FLOUR.
299,00:15:54.67,00:15:54.67,WE HAD OUR MANGOS.
300,00:15:55.75,00:15:55.75,THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TOMATOES LEFT.
301,00:15:57.54,00:15:57.54,THERE WAS AN EGGPLANT LEFT.
302,00:15:58.88,00:15:58.88,"THAT WAS ALL BURNED DOWN,"
303,00:16:00.42,00:16:00.42,AND NOW WE HAVE 10 PEOPLE WITH A CUP OF RICE A DAY.
304,00:16:04.46,00:16:04.46,I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
305,00:16:06.12,00:16:06.12,>> LOOK AT THE TARP.
306,00:16:07.08,00:16:07.08,IT MELTED.
307,00:16:08.75,00:16:08.75,">> THE TARP, WE CAN-- IT'S OKAY."
308,00:16:10.25,00:16:10.25,WE'LL JUST TURN IT AROUND.
309,00:16:12.21,00:16:12.21,>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
310,00:16:14.00,00:16:14.00,>> DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?
311,00:16:18.21,00:16:18.21,>> IT'S NOT WORTH GETTING UPSET ABOUT.
312,00:16:20.38,00:16:20.38,IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE-- IT'S ALREADY DONE.
313,00:16:22.75,00:16:22.75,WE HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP.
314,00:16:24.29,00:16:24.29,>> SOMEONE SHOULD PROBABLY WAKE ME UP
315,00:16:26.29,00:16:26.29,AND TELL ME THAT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.
316,00:16:28.21,00:16:28.21,"I MEAN, I GUESS ALL WE CAN DO IS WRANGLE"
317,00:16:31.04,00:16:31.04,WHAT WE HAVE LEFT AND KEEP IT GOING.
318,00:16:33.46,00:16:33.46,BUT THIS IS A DAY FROM HELL.
319,00:16:40.38,00:16:40.38,>> I'M GOING TO HAVE A PIECE OF EVERYTHING ON THIS TABLE.
320,00:16:42.54,00:16:42.54,>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
321,00:16:44.46,00:16:44.46,"25 DAYS, I HAVEN'T HAD CHOCOLATE."
322,00:16:46.83,00:16:46.83,REWARD WAS AWESOME!
323,00:16:49.67,00:16:49.67,WE PIGGED OUT.
324,00:16:51.08,00:16:51.08,"AND I MEAN, EVERYBODY PUT STUFF ON THEIR PLATE."
325,00:16:54.21,00:16:54.21,I WOLFED DOWN A BROWNIE RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
326,00:16:57.00,00:16:57.00,THEN HIT THE BANANA BREAD AND PIZZA.
327,00:17:00.04,00:17:00.04,AND THEN I SUCKED DOWN ABOUT THREE GLASSES OF SODA.
328,00:17:03.17,00:17:03.17,I COULD HAVE CARED LESS WHAT THEY'RE DOING BACK AT CAMP
329,00:17:06.12,00:17:06.12,BECAUSE THAT WAS HEAVEN.
330,00:17:10.12,00:17:10.12,>> WHO DO YOU ALL THINK IS RUNNING THE SHOW?
331,00:17:12.29,00:17:12.29,>> THAT IS WHAT'S SO UNCLEAR
332,00:17:14.17,00:17:14.17,AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
333,00:17:17.00,00:17:17.00,>> I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO GET A CONSENSUS HOW WE'RE FEELING
334,00:17:20.83,00:17:20.83,AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE ARE FEELING BECAUSE IT'S GOING
335,00:17:22.04,00:17:22.04,TO MAKE TOMORROW EASIER.
336,00:17:24.79,00:17:24.79,>> COME HERE. COME HERE.
337,00:17:29.79,00:17:29.79,>> WHY DID NAY TAKE HIM ASIDE.
338,00:17:31.46,00:17:31.46,>> NAY DOES THAT.
339,00:17:32.46,00:17:32.46,>> ON THE VOLCANO.
340,00:17:34.92,00:17:34.92,>> YOU NEVER TALK.
341,00:17:36.29,00:17:36.29,">> I KNOW, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY."
342,00:17:42.46,00:17:42.46,">> THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE,"
343,00:17:44.04,00:17:44.04,BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
344,00:17:45.04,00:17:45.04,">> NO, THAT'S FOR REAL-FOR REAL."
345,00:17:47.83,00:17:47.83,">> THAT'S FOR REAL, THOUGH."
346,00:17:49.08,00:17:49.08,SHE'S SNEAKY AND SHE'S SITTING
347,00:17:50.33,00:17:50.33,SO COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW CAUSE SHE'S JUST TRYING
348,00:17:51.42,00:17:51.42,TO PICK EVERYBODY OFF
349,00:17:52.96,00:17:52.96,>> NAONKA PULLS ME ASIDE AND SAYS WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.
350,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,WE CAN GET BRENDA OUT OF HERE.
351,00:17:58.33,00:17:58.33,SHE'S RUNNING THE SHOW.
352,00:17:59.96,00:17:59.96,"AND I'M THINKING, THIS IS GREAT."
353,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,IT JUST FELL RIGHT INTO MY HANDS AND I'M TOTALLY GOING
354,00:18:03.38,00:18:03.38,"TO MILK IT FOR ALL IT'S WORTH, YOU KNOW."
355,00:18:05.54,00:18:05.54,AND HOPEFULLY I CAN STAY UNDER THE RADAR
356,00:18:08.21,00:18:08.21,AND SLITHER THROUGH THINGS.
357,00:18:10.17,00:18:10.17,">> LIKE, I WANT BRENDA GONE TOMORROW."
358,00:18:11.71,00:18:11.71,SHE WOULDN'T SEE THIS BLIND SIDE COMING AT ALL.
359,00:18:13.96,00:18:13.96,>> WE CAN'T LET HER HEAR ABOUT IT.
360,00:18:15.79,00:18:15.79,>> I HAVEN'T BEEN SAYING ANYTHING.
361,00:18:17.29,00:18:17.29,>> WHAT ABOUT CHASE?
362,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,>> WHAT ABOUT CHASE?
363,00:18:19.67,00:18:19.67,>> DOES HE WANT HER OUT?
364,00:18:20.67,00:18:20.67,>> HE'S SO SCATTER BRAINED.
365,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,">> IF YOU GUYS ARE IN, I'M GOING TO DO IT."
366,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,>> I'M IN. >> ALL RIGHT.
367,00:18:26.29,00:18:26.29,">> IN ORDER TO WIN THIS GAME, YOU MUST MAKE POWER MOVES."
368,00:18:29.08,00:18:29.08,YOU CAN MAKE A BIG MOVE THAT CAN SHIFT THE GAME
369,00:18:30.79,00:18:30.79,"IN THE WHOLE OTHER DIRECTION, BUT IF YOU MAKE A POWER MOVE,"
370,00:18:33.54,00:18:33.54,"YOU'RE MAKING A MOVE THAT WILL PUSH YOU FORWARD, AND THE MORE"
371,00:18:36.79,00:18:36.79,"YOU KEEP MAKING THESE POWER MOVES,"
372,00:18:38.08,00:18:38.08,EVERYTHING'S JUST GOING TO FALL IN LINE.
373,00:18:55.29,00:18:55.29,>> HOLLY'S FREAKING OUT.
374,00:18:57.25,00:18:57.25,>> SHE'S TRYING TO CHANGE THE GAME UP RIGHT NOW.
375,00:18:59.33,00:18:59.33,>> OKAY.
376,00:19:01.33,00:19:01.33,">> WHEN I GOT BACK FROM THE REWARD,"
377,00:19:03.08,00:19:03.08,I WANTED TO TALK TO BRENDA.
378,00:19:04.92,00:19:04.92,"I JUST DECIDED TO COME OUT AND TELL HER, YOU KNOW, THE PLAN."
379,00:19:07.33,00:19:07.33,THAT THE OTHERS HAVE.
380,00:19:09.17,00:19:09.17,"WELL, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON."
381,00:19:10.83,00:19:10.83,THERE'S THIS PLAN RIGHT NOW TO TAKE YOU OUT.
382,00:19:13.21,00:19:13.21,">> OH, MY GOD."
383,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,>> IT'S HOLLY THAT'S ORCHESTRATING IT.
384,00:19:17.29,00:19:17.29,"HOLLY AND BEN, I THINK."
385,00:19:18.42,00:19:18.42,"FOR WHATEVER REASON, I TRUST BRENDA."
386,00:19:20.38,00:19:20.38,THAT'S ALL IT COMES DOWN TO IS I TRUST HER AND I PUT MY GAME PLAN
387,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,"IN HER AND, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO REASON OR RHYME."
388,00:19:28.38,00:19:28.38,IT'S JUST THE SIMPLE FACT THAT I TRUST HER.
389,00:19:30.75,00:19:30.75,"YOU KNOW, I'VE GONE WITH MY HEART THIS ENTIRE GAME."
390,00:19:33.12,00:19:33.12,THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO TURN AT THIS POINT AND BACKSTAB YOU.
391,00:19:36.92,00:19:36.92,THAT WOULD JUST MAKE ME LOOK LIKE AN ASS.
392,00:19:39.25,00:19:39.25,>> COOL.
393,00:19:40.50,00:19:40.50,"LUCKILY, I HAVE CHASE, WHO TRUSTS ME 1,000%,"
394,00:19:44.67,00:19:44.67,AND HE CAME AND TOLD ME THE WHOLE PLAN.
395,00:19:46.42,00:19:46.42,IT IS A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.
396,00:19:48.25,00:19:48.25,BUT I STILL THINK THAT I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING CRAZY
397,00:19:51.29,00:19:51.29,TO BEAT THEM.
398,00:19:53.00,00:19:53.00,"LIKE, I'M NOT EVEN THAT IMPRESSED."
399,00:19:59.46,00:19:59.46,>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT BRENDA?
400,00:20:00.88,00:20:00.88,>> SHE'S SHADY RIGHT NOW.
401,00:20:02.67,00:20:02.67,AND SHE HAS TOO MUCH POWER RIGHT NOW.
402,00:20:04.88,00:20:04.88,>> BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT
403,00:20:06.08,00:20:06.08,TO GET BRENDA OUT RIGHT NOW.
404,00:20:07.12,00:20:07.12,I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO GET BENRY.
405,00:20:08.96,00:20:08.96,">> WHOA, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BENRY."
406,00:20:11.00,00:20:11.00,I THINK IT SHOULD BE BRENDA.
407,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,>> DO YOU TRUST HOLLY?
408,00:20:14.12,00:20:14.12,>> FOR NOW.
409,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,>> I DON'T RIGHT NOW.
410,00:20:17.08,00:20:17.08,HOLLY AND BENRY HAVE PUT TOGETHER
411,00:20:18.88,00:20:18.88,THIS PLAN TO VOTE OUT BRENDA NEXT.
412,00:20:20.38,00:20:20.38,AND I TOLD BRENDA THAT.
413,00:20:23.00,00:20:23.00,>> CHASE HAS BEEN RUNNING AROUND HERE LIKE A CHICKEN
414,00:20:25.25,00:20:25.25,"WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF, TELLING PEOPLE'S GAME PLANS."
415,00:20:28.12,00:20:28.12,"LATELY, HE'S BEEN SO SCATTER BRAINED"
416,00:20:29.58,00:20:29.58,AND SO NERVOUS THAT I HAVE TO FLOP.
417,00:20:31.75,00:20:31.75,I HAVE TO BE SMART.
418,00:20:32.96,00:20:32.96,I HAVE TO GO WITH HOLLY AND JANE.
419,00:20:34.54,00:20:34.54,I HAVE TO GO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WANT
420,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,TO GET THE STRONG PEOPLE OUT.
421,00:20:36.58,00:20:36.58,IT'S THE SMART THING TO DO.
422,00:20:37.83,00:20:37.83,WE CANNOT TRUST CHASE.
423,00:20:40.79,00:20:40.79,>> REALLY? >> WE CAN'T.
424,00:20:42.88,00:20:42.88,AND I KNOW THAT'S MIND BLOWING AND IT SOUND LIKE I'M (\\BLEEP\\).
425,00:20:46.17,00:20:46.17,DO NOT TRUST HIM.
426,00:20:47.83,00:20:47.83,HE'S PLAYING BOTH IN THE MIDDLE.
427,00:20:49.62,00:20:49.62,HE WANTS YOU OUT NEXT.
428,00:20:51.17,00:20:51.17,>> REALLY? WHAT DO WE DO.
429,00:20:53.83,00:20:53.83,">> WE HAVE TO GET BRENDA OUT, WE HAVE TO GET SASH OUT"
430,00:20:55.83,00:20:55.83,AND THEN GET CHASE OUT.
431,00:20:57.17,00:20:57.17,>> SO YOU'RE IN ON THIS.
432,00:20:59.83,00:20:59.83,CHASE IS CRAZY.
433,00:21:01.42,00:21:01.42,HE'S BEEN PLAYING WITH MIS HEART AND EMOTION
434,00:21:03.50,00:21:03.50,THIS ENTIRE GAME SINCE DAY TWO.
435,00:21:05.83,00:21:05.83,HE IS BEING PLAYED BY BRENDA.
436,00:21:07.42,00:21:07.42,HOPEFULLY CHASE WILL GROW A PAIR AND REALIZE WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM.
437,00:21:10.96,00:21:10.96,>> CHASE IS TOTALLY AGAINST GETTING
438,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,BRENDA OR SASH OUT.
439,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,>> YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
440,00:21:18.54,00:21:18.54,">> I AM SO-- JANE, LOOK AT ME."
441,00:21:20.21,00:21:20.21,I AM DEAD SERIOUS.
442,00:21:22.12,00:21:22.12,YOU CAN'T TRUST CHASE RIGHT NOW.
443,00:21:23.50,00:21:23.50,AND HE'S LIKE WIGGING OUT.
444,00:21:25.42,00:21:25.42,">> I ORIGINALLY TRUSTED CHASE, BUT CHASE IS SUCKING UP"
445,00:21:29.12,00:21:29.12,TO BRENDA LIKE HE WANTS TO GET IN HER PANTS OR SOMETHING.
446,00:21:33.42,00:21:33.42,I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF MAGIC SPELL SHE'S CASTING OVER
447,00:21:38.21,00:21:38.21,"CHASE RIGHT NOW, BUT IF THAT BIG OLD COUNTRY BOY WANTS TO GO BACK"
448,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,"ON HIS WORD, HE'S GOING TO CATCH HELL WHEN HE GETS BACK"
449,00:21:45.00,00:21:45.00,TO CAROLINA BECAUSE CAROLINA PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT.
450,00:21:48.50,00:21:48.50,>> YOU CANNOT TRUST CHASE.
451,00:21:51.04,00:21:51.04,>> I TOLD YOU.

455,00:21:58.58,00:21:58.58,>> HE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR BRENDA.
456,00:22:00.29,00:22:00.29,>> DOESN'T HE SEE THAT BRENDA AND SASH
457,00:22:02.04,00:22:02.04,ARE IN TOTAL CHARGE OF THIS GAME?
458,00:22:03.21,00:22:03.21,">> YEAH, HE SEES IT BUT HE'S STUPID."
459,00:22:05.71,00:22:05.71,>> WHAT THE ... IS WRONG WITH CHASE?
460,00:22:14.75,00:22:14.75,">> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS!"

597,00:29:53.12,00:29:53.12,>> I SAY WE STICK WITH THAT. >> OKAY.
598,00:29:54.83,00:29:54.83,>> I PERSONALLY THINK WE SHOULD VOTE BENRY OUT FIRST.
599,00:29:57.21,00:29:57.21,"I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH PEOPLE I TRUST,"
600,00:29:59.62,00:29:59.62,"AND RIGHT NOW, I DON'T TRUST BENRY."
601,00:30:00.75,00:30:00.75,"SO, I'M TRYING TO PROTECT BRENDA,"
602,00:30:02.88,00:30:02.88,BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS TO DO IT.
603,00:30:08.67,00:30:08.67,(birds squawking)
604,00:30:17.29,00:30:17.29,>> HE DRIVES ME CRAZY. >> HE DRIVES ME NUTS.
605,00:30:19.50,00:30:19.50,YESTERDAY HE PISSED ME OFF TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF PISS-IVITY.
606,00:30:21.92,00:30:21.92,>> YEAH. >> MM.
607,00:30:28.21,00:30:28.21,>> YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON? >> WHAT?
608,00:30:30.33,00:30:30.33,>> WE'RE TRYING TO VOTE BRENDA OUT TONIGHT.
609,00:30:33.75,00:30:33.75,AND ME AND YOU COULD MAKE A HUGE POWER MOVE.
610,00:30:35.92,00:30:35.92,AND IT'S GONNA BE SO EASY TO GET PEOPLE TO TURN ON HER.
611,00:30:38.75,00:30:38.75,>> I KNOW. >> BECAUSE THEY SEE HER AS A THREAT.
612,00:30:40.42,00:30:40.42,">> IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME A FEW DAYS AGO,"
613,00:30:42.92,00:30:42.92,I'D SAY THAT BRENDA HELD A LOT OF CARDS IN THIS GAME.
614,00:30:47.08,00:30:47.08,"BUT NOW, TIDES HAVE TURNED A LITTLE BIT,"
615,00:30:50.08,00:30:50.08,AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THE GAME
616,00:30:52.62,00:30:52.62,THAT I'M STARTING TO WORRY A LITTLE BIT.
617,00:30:54.88,00:30:54.88,">> YOU'RE COMING TO ME STRAIGHT, RIGHT? >> YEAH."
618,00:31:11.12,00:31:11.12,">> SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE THING?"
619,00:31:12.92,00:31:12.92,>> I DON'T KNOW. I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
620,00:31:14.75,00:31:14.75,'CAUSE I'VE TRIED TO... I'VE SAT BACK AND NOT REALLY...
621,00:31:17.33,00:31:17.33,>> I JUST THINK BRENDA'S BEEN THE RING LEADER.
622,00:31:19.62,00:31:19.62,>> SHE WAS THE RING LEADER OVER AT YOUR CAMP. >> YEAH.
623,00:31:21.21,00:31:21.21,>> SHE'S THE RING LEADER HERE. SHE'S JUST...
624,00:31:23.00,00:31:23.00,"SHE'S GOT EVERYBODY ON HER LIST,"
625,00:31:24.21,00:31:24.21,AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GO.
626,00:31:25.42,00:31:25.42,"SO, THAT'S HOW I FEEL."
627,00:31:27.88,00:31:27.88,>> YEAH. I'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME WITH MY HEART
628,00:31:30.75,00:31:30.75,"AND NOT MY HEAD A LOT OF THE TIME,"
629,00:31:32.33,00:31:32.33,AND IT ABSOLUTELY KILLS ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE TO VOTE BRENDA OUT.
630,00:31:35.71,00:31:35.71,I DON'T TRUST BENRY.
631,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,I DON'T TRUST HOLLY ALL THAT MUCH.
632,00:31:39.88,00:31:39.88,DAN-- I DON'T REALLY TRUST HIM.
633,00:31:41.50,00:31:41.50,NAY-- I DON'T TRUST HER ANYMORE.
634,00:31:43.12,00:31:43.12,"SO, IF BRENDA'S GONE,"
635,00:31:45.21,00:31:45.21,I'M PLAYING THE GAME WITH PEOPLE THAT I DON'T REALLY TRUST.
636,00:31:47.42,00:31:47.42,THAT'S A... THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT.
637,00:31:57.92,00:31:57.92,>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU.
638,00:32:00.00,00:32:00.00,I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY NUMBERS TO SAVE YOU.
639,00:32:03.21,00:32:03.21,THE THING THAT CHANGED WAS NAY.
640,00:32:04.71,00:32:04.71,>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? NAY'S NOT GONNA VOTE FOR ME.
641,00:32:08.92,00:32:08.92,>> NAY SWEARS SHE'S VOTING FOR YOU.
642,00:32:10.58,00:32:10.58,NAY WAS... NAY'S THE ONE THAT SCREWED IT UP.
643,00:32:12.54,00:32:12.54,IT SURE AS HELL WASN'T MY IDEA.
644,00:32:15.04,00:32:15.04,>> HMM.
645,00:32:16.88,00:32:16.88,IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS OPERATION TAKE-OUT-BRENDA IN PLACE.
646,00:32:21.12,00:32:21.12,"I'M PRETTY ANNOYED ABOUT IT,"
647,00:32:22.96,00:32:22.96,BUT I THINK ALL I CAN DO IS STAY COOL.
648,00:32:25.58,00:32:25.58,THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS START SCRAMBLING.
649,00:32:27.96,00:32:27.96,IT JUST SHOWS THAT YOU'RE DESPERATE.
650,00:32:29.75,00:32:29.75,"SO, YOU KNOW, IF I SHOW CONFIDENCE,"
651,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,MY FRIENDS HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME.
652,00:32:34.29,00:32:34.29,"IT SHOWS THAT, YEAH, I KIND OF WANT TO STICK WITH BRENDA."
653,00:32:37.12,00:32:37.12,>> TELL HER WHO MESSED THE FIVE OF US FIRST?
654,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,>> NAONKA? >> EXACTLY.
655,00:32:40.67,00:32:40.67,>> BUT HOW?
656,00:32:42.17,00:32:42.17,>> SHE WANTS YOU OUT.
657,00:32:43.29,00:32:43.29,">> I TRUSTED HER 1,000%. >> ME, TOO."
658,00:32:45.92,00:32:45.92,">> BUT THEN, NOW WHAT?"
659,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE LOYAL TO YOU.
660,00:32:49.12,00:32:49.12,"THEY SAW THE ALLIANCE, AND NOW THEY'RE BREAKING IT, THOUGH,"
661,00:32:52.29,00:32:52.29,"SO, YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE YOU?"
662,00:33:05.62,00:33:05.62,>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
663,00:33:07.58,00:33:07.58,MAYBE YOU BLINDSIDE THEM WITH YOUR IMMUNITY IDOL.
664,00:33:09.58,00:33:09.58,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
665,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,"BECAUSE IF I GET VOTED OUT TONIGHT,"
666,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN GET THE NUMBERS BACK.
667,00:33:15.29,00:33:15.29,>> THE IDOL IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO BE USED
668,00:33:18.54,00:33:18.54,"TO NOT ONLY TO PROTECT YOURSELF,"
669,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,BUT ALSO SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR ALLIANCE.
670,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,MY GOAL WOULD BE TO NEVER HAVE TO USE IT AT ALL.
671,00:33:25.12,00:33:25.12,"HOWEVER, AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE MOMENT CAME UP"
672,00:33:29.00,00:33:29.00,"WHERE I NEEDED TO USE IT TO SAVE BRENDA,"
673,00:33:31.71,00:33:31.71,I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER VERY STRONGLY DOING THAT.
674,00:33:37.46,00:33:37.46,>> YOU DON'T THINK SASH IS GOING TO GIVE BRENDA THE IDOL?
675,00:33:39.12,00:33:39.12,">> HELL, NO."
676,00:33:40.75,00:33:40.75,>> I'M JUST FURIOUS THAT NAONKA WOULD MAKE SUCH A DUMB MOVE.
677,00:33:44.67,00:33:44.67,I THOUGHT WE HAD A GREAT ALLIANCE.
678,00:33:46.42,00:33:46.42,I REALLY BELIEVED THAT WE WOULD GO TO THE END.
679,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,BUT NOW I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE NAONKA'S FACE.
680,00:33:51.38,00:33:51.38,"I WANTED TO TAKE OUT BENRY,"
681,00:33:53.75,00:33:53.75,"BUT, HOPEFULLY, SASH IS GOING TO GIVE ME HIS IMMUNITY IDOL,"
682,00:33:56.88,00:33:56.88,AND WE BLINDSIDE NAONKA.
683,00:34:13.88,00:34:13.88,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
684,00:34:19.62,00:34:19.62,"ALINA AND MARTY, VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL."
685,00:34:26.29,00:34:26.29,"SASH, WERE YOU SURPRISED"
686,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,AT THE LAST VOTE WHEN MARTY WAS SENT HOME?
687,00:34:30.12,00:34:30.12,">> YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED,"
688,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,"BUT SINCE THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
689,00:34:34.12,00:34:34.12,"THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESHUFFLING IN THE TRIBE,"
690,00:34:37.12,00:34:37.12,"AND SO, I THINK I'M MORE OUT OF THE LOOP NOW"
691,00:34:39.62,00:34:39.62,THAN I'VE BEEN SINCE THE GAME STARTED.
692,00:34:41.88,00:34:41.88,>> Jeff: REALLY? >> UH-HUH.
693,00:34:43.38,00:34:43.38,">> Jeff: CHASE, DO YOU BELIEVE"
694,00:34:44.79,00:34:44.79,SASH BELIEVES HE'S OUT OF THE LOOP?
695,00:34:46.83,00:34:46.83,">> I DO, BECAUSE HE HAD A STRONG ALLIANCE,"
696,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,AND NOW THAT STRONG ALLIANCE SEEMS TO BE GO GONE.
697,00:34:52.25,00:34:52.25,">> Jeff: BRENDA, ANY REGRETS OVER THE LAST VOTE?"
698,00:34:54.71,00:34:54.71,>> YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE MARTY.
699,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,"ALL MY PEEPS KNOW IT, BUT I HAD TO PROVE SOMETHING"
700,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,TO PEOPLE WHO WERE IN MY ALLIANCE
701,00:35:02.38,00:35:02.38,THAT THEY COULD TRUST ME.
702,00:35:04.33,00:35:04.33,>> Jeff: HOW HARD IS IT FOR YOU TO TRUST PEOPLE OUT HERE?
703,00:35:07.25,00:35:07.25,>> NOT HARD.
704,00:35:09.04,00:35:09.04,I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT FROM THE START.
705,00:35:10.62,00:35:10.62,AND I THOUGHT
706,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,"THAT THERE WAS A REALLY STRONG CORE ALLIANCE,"
707,00:35:15.83,00:35:15.83,THE STRONGEST ONE IN THIS WHOLE GAME.
708,00:35:17.75,00:35:17.75,I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT.
709,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,AND IT LOOKS LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS
710,00:35:21.67,00:35:21.67,THERE'S A BREAK IN THE ALLIANCE
711,00:35:23.33,00:35:23.33,"BECAUSE OF NAONKA WANTING TO JUMP SHIP,"
712,00:35:27.38,00:35:27.38,AND THIS IS THE MOST SURPRISING THING
713,00:35:29.42,00:35:29.42,BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THESE GUYS RIGHT HERE.
714,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,"MEANWHILE, SHE'S THE ONE THAT WANTS TO GO."
715,00:35:36.54,00:35:36.54,">> Jeff: NAONKA, THAT'S A PRETTY STRAIGHT-OUT ACCUSATION."
716,00:35:39.88,00:35:39.88,">> I DON'T THINK IT WAS ME, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I THINK..."
717,00:35:41.83,00:35:41.83,>> Jeff: HOLD ON. YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS YOU?
718,00:35:43.50,00:35:43.50,">> IT WAS NOT ME, OKAY?"
719,00:35:45.46,00:35:45.46,"EVERYBODY COULD PUT IT ON ME, BUT I'LL PUT IT LIKE THIS."
720,00:35:47.83,00:35:47.83,CHASE WAS RUNNING AROUND YESTERDAY WITH HIS HEAD CUT OFF.
721,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,IT'S SOMETHING THAT CHASE DOES.
722,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HE WAS PARANOID.
723,00:35:55.62,00:35:55.62,">> Jeff: SO YOU'RE TELLING BRENDA RIGHT NOW,"
724,00:35:57.96,00:35:57.96,"""IT WASN'T ME."""
725,00:35:59.25,00:35:59.25,">> IT WAS NOT ME. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT"
726,00:36:00.67,00:36:00.67,"TO FOLLOW YOUR INTUITION IN THIS GAME, BUT..."
727,00:36:02.83,00:36:02.83,>> CAN I GET IN ON THIS? >> IT WAS NOT ME.
728,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,>> I DID GO TO BRENDA BECAUSE I TRUSTED HER.
729,00:36:07.08,00:36:07.08,SO THIS IS NO NEW NEWS TO ANYBODY.
730,00:36:09.71,00:36:09.71,">> Jeff: PURPLE KELLY, WEIGH IN ON THIS."
731,00:36:12.25,00:36:12.25,GIVE US 20 YEARS OF WISDOM.
732,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,">> WELL, LET ME TELL YOU, 20 YEARS OF WISDOM."
733,00:36:17.21,00:36:17.21,I THINK THAT...
734,00:36:19.33,00:36:19.33,"WELL, I THINK THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL"
735,00:36:23.29,00:36:23.29,I FELT COMPLETELY OUT OF THE LOOP
736,00:36:25.04,00:36:25.04,"ON WHAT'S GOING ON, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST."
737,00:36:26.88,00:36:26.88,>> Jeff: HAVE YOU BEEN LEARNING STUFF TONIGHT?
738,00:36:28.21,00:36:28.21,">> YES, COMPLETELY!"
739,00:36:30.29,00:36:30.29,"LIKE, MY WHOLE... MY..."
740,00:36:31.42,00:36:31.42,THE WHEELS ARE TURNING IN MY HEAD.
741,00:36:32.79,00:36:32.79,"MY GAME PLAN, IT'S... I'M..."
742,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,"LIKE, THIS... IT'S ENLIGHTENING."
743,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,">> Jeff: SO, BRENDA, YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALKING."
744,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,NOW WHERE DO YOU SIT? WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?
745,00:36:42.00,00:36:42.00,>> WHY WOULD SASH BREAK UP THE BEST ALLIANCE HERE
746,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,'CAUSE HE'S SO SMART?
747,00:36:47.38,00:36:47.38,AND WHY WOULD CHASE LET ME IN ON IT THE DAY BEFORE?
748,00:36:50.54,00:36:50.54,HE DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
749,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,"SO THEN, IT MAKES SENSE THAT IT WAS NAONKA WANTING TO JUMP SHIP."
750,00:36:56.42,00:36:56.42,THAT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME.
751,00:36:58.17,00:36:58.17,">> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENS, SASH, IF YOU BREAK TRUST IN THIS GAME?"
752,00:37:00.88,00:37:00.88,WHAT DO YOU PUT AT RISK?
753,00:37:02.62,00:37:02.62,>> THAT YOU MAY GET SENT HOME.
754,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,I THINK THE PEOPLE HERE THAT REALLY KNOW ME KNOW
755,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,"THAT I AM TRUSTWORTHY, AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY"
756,00:37:11.21,00:37:11.21,"I MADE IT TO THE MERGE, AND HOPEFULLY, THAT'S WHY"
757,00:37:13.29,00:37:13.29,I'LL STICK AROUND FOR ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL.
758,00:37:15.38,00:37:15.38,">> Jeff: SO, BRENDA, DID YOU SCRAMBLE THIS AFTERNOON?"
759,00:37:18.67,00:37:18.67,>> I DID LITTLE THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD HELP.
760,00:37:21.04,00:37:21.04,"I KNEW THAT IF I HAD A CHANCE,"
761,00:37:22.58,00:37:22.58,"I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WITH CHASE AND WITH SASH,"
762,00:37:25.38,00:37:25.38,"AND IF I TALKED WITH BOTH OF THEM,"
763,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"TO MAKE THEM SEE, LIKE, WHAT THE HELL?,"
764,00:37:28.92,00:37:28.92,MAYBE THEY WOULD SWITCH.
765,00:37:30.50,00:37:30.50,"THE REST IS, LIKE, ""OKAY, YEAH, THEY'LL VOTE FOR ME, WHATEVER."""
766,00:37:32.92,00:37:32.92,BUT THAT WAS MY PLAN.
767,00:37:34.92,00:37:34.92,">> Jeff: SO, BRENDA, YOU WOULD ARGUE"
768,00:37:36.33,00:37:36.33,"THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO STAY IN THIS GAME, EVEN NOW."
769,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,">> JUST NOT SCRAMBLING, YEAH."
770,00:37:40.79,00:37:40.79,">> Jeff: WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE WORD ""SCRAMBLING?"""
771,00:37:42.96,00:37:42.96,ARE YOU TOO PROUD FOR THAT WORD?
772,00:37:44.46,00:37:44.46,>> I THINK SO. IT'S THE TRUTH.
773,00:37:46.71,00:37:46.71,"I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS,"
774,00:37:49.04,00:37:49.04,AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO THINGS.
775,00:37:50.83,00:37:50.83,>> Jeff: SO SCRAMBLING IS BENEATH YOU?
776,00:37:53.79,00:37:53.79,>> IT'S JUST NOT MY STYLE.
777,00:37:58.29,00:37:58.29,">> IN MY OPINION, I THINK IF PEOPLE SEE YOU SCRAMBLING,"
778,00:38:00.08,00:38:00.08,THEY SEE YOU AS IF YOU'VE ALREADY LOST.
779,00:38:01.88,00:38:01.88,"""LOOK AT HER, SHE'S SCRAMBLING. LOOK AT THAT."
780,00:38:03.46,00:38:03.46,"ISN'T SHE FUNNY? DON'T YOU FEEL BAD FOR HER?"""
781,00:38:05.25,00:38:05.25,WHO CAN I REALLY CHANGE HERE?
782,00:38:07.83,00:38:07.83,IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THIS WHOLE TIME.
783,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,"I TALK TO YOU ONE-ON-ONE, I LOOK AT YOU IN THE EYE,"
784,00:38:12.79,00:38:12.79,AND YOU KNOW THAT I'M REAL.
785,00:38:14.96,00:38:14.96,">> Jeff: SASH, YOU GOT TO BE SHAKING IN YOUR BOOTS."
786,00:38:17.71,00:38:17.71,THIS IS DISASTROUS FOR ANYBODY WHO HAD AN ALLIANCE.
787,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,"'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, THIS..."
788,00:38:21.83,00:38:21.83,IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BOMB JUST DROPPED IN HERE AND BA-BOOM!
789,00:38:24.21,00:38:24.21,">> I THINK SINCE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
790,00:38:26.42,00:38:26.42,EVERYONE'S ALLIANCES HAVE CHANGED A BIT.
791,00:38:30.08,00:38:30.08,AND PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT OUTLOOK IN THE GAME NOW
792,00:38:33.33,00:38:33.33,"THAN THEY DID JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,"
793,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES ACCORDINGLY.
794,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,">> Jeff: WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE"
795,00:38:42.29,00:38:42.29,THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHIES
796,00:38:44.38,00:38:44.38,ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP YOURSELF IN THIS GAME.
797,00:38:47.12,00:38:47.12,LET'S SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT.
798,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,"JANE, YOU HAVE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY."
799,00:38:49.79,00:38:49.79,I KNOW YOU'RE KEEPING IT.
800,00:38:51.12,00:38:51.12,>> YES.
801,00:38:52.21,00:38:52.21,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU CANNOT VOTE FOR JANE."
802,00:38:53.58,00:38:53.58,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME. IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
803,00:38:55.75,00:38:55.75,"DAN, YOU'RE UP."
804,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,>> YOU SHOULD HAVE SCRAMBLED.
805,00:39:32.21,00:39:32.21,">> YOU ARE MY REAL, TRUE ENEMY,"
806,00:39:34.50,00:39:34.50,AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.
807,00:39:58.50,00:39:58.50,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
808,00:40:09.04,00:40:09.04,IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
809,00:40:11.25,00:40:11.25,"AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO."
810,00:40:26.79,00:40:26.79,"OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
811,00:40:29.25,00:40:29.25,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
812,00:40:30.83,00:40:30.83,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
813,00:40:33.00,00:40:33.00,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
814,00:40:37.96,00:40:37.96,FIRST VOTE-- BRENDA.
815,00:40:42.25,00:40:42.25,NAONKA.
816,00:40:49.21,00:40:49.21,"BENRY. ONE VOTE BRENDA, ONE VOTE BENRY, ONE VOTE NAONKA."
817,00:40:56.29,00:40:56.29,BRENDA. THAT'S TWO VOTES BRENDA.
818,00:41:02.42,00:41:02.42,"BRENDA. THAT'S THREE VOTES BRENDA,"
819,00:41:04.38,00:41:04.38,"ONE VOTE BENRY, ONE VOTE NAONKA."
820,00:41:08.71,00:41:08.71,THAT'S FOUR VOTES BRENDA.
821,00:41:15.83,00:41:15.83,ELEVENTH PERSON VOTED OUT
822,00:41:17.38,00:41:17.38,AND THE THIRD MEMBER OF OUR JURY-- BRENDA.
823,00:41:19.75,00:41:19.75,THAT'S FIVE. THAT'S ENOUGH.
824,00:41:21.17,00:41:21.17,YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
825,00:41:34.17,00:41:34.17,"BRENDA, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
826,00:41:38.83,00:41:38.83,>> Jeff: TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
827,00:41:51.54,00:41:51.54,"WELL, IF THERE'S ONE THING TO BE LEARNED IT'S THIS."
828,00:41:54.50,00:41:54.50,IF YOU WANT TO WIN THIS GAME AND THE MILLION DOLLARS
829,00:41:57.21,00:41:57.21,"THAT GOES WITH IT, YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT FOR IT."
830,00:41:59.62,00:41:59.62,GRAB YOUR TORCHES. HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
831,00:42:01.58,00:42:01.58,GOOD NIGHT.
832,00:42:14.21,00:42:14.21,>> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
833,00:42:20.54,00:42:20.54,>> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR...
834,00:42:22.75,00:42:22.75,NAONKA'S ANTICS HAVE THE TRIBE IN AN UPROAR.
835,00:42:25.33,00:42:25.33,>> I WAS JUST SHOCKED
836,00:42:26.62,00:42:26.62,THAT NAONKA WOULD DO SOMETHING SO STUPID.
837,00:42:28.29,00:42:28.29,>> NAONKA OBVIOUSLY WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT.
838,00:42:30.54,00:42:30.54,WE'VE GOT TO GET HER OUT NOW.
839,00:42:33.67,00:42:33.67,">> IF ONE OF THE GUYS HAD DONE THAT, I WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM"
840,00:42:36.29,00:42:36.29,TO JUST GET THE ... OUT OF HERE AND DON'T COME BACK.
841,00:42:44.50,00:42:44.50,">> I'M STILL IN DISBELIEF, REALLY, AT HOW OUTPLAYED I WAS"
842,00:42:49.21,00:42:49.21,"BY THE PERSON THAT I TRUSTED THE MOST, NAONKA."
843,00:42:51.50,00:42:51.50,IT'S JUST FUNNY HOW THE GAME CHANGED SO FAST FOR ME.
844,00:42:54.17,00:42:54.17,"ONE DAY I WAS AT THE TOP, AND NOW, I'M OUT."
845,00:42:57.21,00:42:57.21,IT WAS A CRAZY GAME
846,00:42:58.58,00:42:58.58,"THAT I-I DIDN'T EXPECT WOULD END SO SOON FOR ME,"
847,00:43:01.92,00:43:01.92,"BUT, UM, I AM KIND OF SAD THAT IT'S OVER."
