6,00:00:12.23,00:00:12.23,(cheering)Taking advantage of Maraamu's
7,00:00:14.57,00:00:14.57,"low morale, Rob strategizedbehind the scenes, and was the"

11,00:00:26.57,00:00:26.57,to do it.That's straight out of The
12,00:00:28.23,00:00:28.23, Godfather.>> PROBST: Rotu remained
13,00:00:30.93,00:00:30.93,untouchable with another victoryat the immunity challenge.

15,00:00:36.37,00:00:36.37,"Nice job.At Tribal Council,"
16,00:00:38.03,00:00:38.03,Maraamu followed Rob's lead andvoted Hunter off the island.
17,00:00:41.37,00:00:41.37,">> Good luck, you guys.>> PROBST: The tribe has spoken."

19,00:02:12.40,00:02:12.40,"(indistinct voices)>> Without a doubt, I think this"
20,00:02:19.10,00:02:19.10,"is my game, and I'm the onethat's controlling it, for the"
21,00:02:21.90,00:02:21.90,most part.I don't think Hunter saw it
22,00:02:25.20,00:02:25.20,coming a mile away.>> Need some more... more
23,00:02:28.43,00:02:28.43,stuff.>> Last night at Tribal Council
24,00:02:33.17,00:02:33.17,"the four other members decidedto vote out Hunter, which I"
25,00:02:37.27,00:02:37.27,think was a pretty stupid idea.>> There you go.
26,00:02:40.33,00:02:40.33,You got it.>> I think the reason being is
27,00:02:42.53,00:02:42.53,because Rob and Sean were tiredof having somebody else in a
28,00:02:45.67,00:02:45.67,"leadership role, and now they'reready to take over."
29,00:02:48.37,00:02:48.37,"You can see it in what they do.I mean, we come back and we got"
30,00:02:51.67,00:02:51.67,to build a fire.And I think that was their main
31,00:02:54.20,00:02:54.20,motivation in getting him off.I thought I was the one gone.
32,00:02:58.43,00:02:58.43,I just want to know why you voteone of your strongest members
33,00:03:02.93,00:03:02.93,out.>> I think we all probably had a
34,00:03:04.80,00:03:04.80,different reason.>> I mean I'm glad I'm here.
35,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,>> Uh-huh.>> 'Cause I thought I was going.
36,00:03:09.30,00:03:09.30,"But I'm just, I'm really justshocked."
37,00:03:11.23,00:03:11.23,>> Basically just kind of dosomething different.
38,00:03:13.70,00:03:13.70,I'm just like not the bigpicture.
39,00:03:15.43,00:03:15.43,"I mean, the game has no rules.>> I know, I mean, we talked,"
40,00:03:18.53,00:03:18.53,and I told you why we voted oneach other.
41,00:03:20.93,00:03:20.93,"So I just, if you guys want totell me, that's fine."
42,00:03:23.93,00:03:23.93,"If not, then, that's fine, too.I'm just asking."
43,00:03:26.70,00:03:26.70,"Nobody had a good explanation,no one."
44,00:03:28.50,00:03:28.50,"Sarah's explanation was she justfelt like, you know, she had two"
45,00:03:31.67,00:03:31.67,people and that's who she wantedto vote on.
46,00:03:33.80,00:03:33.80,"Well, Rob voted on that person,that's why she voted on him."
47,00:03:36.70,00:03:36.70,"She doesn't think for herself,Rob tells her what to vote on."
48,00:03:40.27,00:03:40.27,">> I don't know, it's hard toexplain what I was thinking."
49,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,You thought you were the one togo?
50,00:03:45.43,00:03:45.43,">> I mean, I thought it would bestupid to vote him out."
51,00:03:48.30,00:03:48.30,>> I'm glad I voted the way Idid.

53,00:03:52.77,00:03:52.77,>> They think it's the beginningof Maraamu-- I have no idea.
54,00:03:55.77,00:03:55.77,"I hope it's not the end, becauseI don't want to go."
55,00:03:58.37,00:03:58.37,"I'll be the next to go.If we lose, I'm gone."
56,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,They're not going to keepsomebody like me around.
57,00:04:17.80,00:04:17.80,>> This is a big pig tail in theback.
58,00:04:19.77,00:04:19.77,>> A big pig tail?>> A big braided pig tail.

68,00:04:49.43,00:04:49.43,that.>> I think as every day
69,00:04:51.40,00:04:51.40,"passes here, I think our tribeis beginning to find more of its"
70,00:04:55.07,00:04:55.07,groove.People are beginning to relax a
71,00:04:57.00,00:04:57.00,"little bit.I mean, yesterday was honestly"
72,00:04:59.13,00:04:59.13,the best day I've had here.>> Yeah.
73,00:05:02.13,00:05:02.13,">> Hey, buddy.>> This tribe is unbelievable."
74,00:05:04.73,00:05:04.73,The reason we keep winning isbecause of the unity and love
75,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17,that is in this tribe.It's an unreal experience to see
76,00:05:12.37,00:05:12.37,eight people coming togetherevery single day to provide for
77,00:05:16.27,00:05:16.27,"each other, not just rallyaround each other for a"
78,00:05:19.50,00:05:19.50,"challenge, but every single daydoing an activity that will"
79,00:05:23.30,00:05:23.30,provide for the rest of thegroup.

190,00:13:37.07,00:13:37.07,"mangos, too?>> Oh, heck, you guys."
191,00:13:39.07,00:13:39.07,Grapefruit just made my wholeentire day.
192,00:13:41.43,00:13:41.43,">> It was nice to get away, youknow, and see some new scenery."
193,00:13:45.13,00:13:45.13,The beach here is beautiful.And the fruit definitely by far
194,00:13:48.63,00:13:48.63,outdoes everything over at Rotu.I would have chosen here over
195,00:13:51.80,00:13:51.80,"that place for the fruit.>> So, what do you all do in"
196,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,real life?>> I was a teacher until this
197,00:13:57.07,00:13:57.07,"year, and then I took off.I'm bartending, saving money for"
198,00:13:59.93,00:13:59.93,"grad school.>> Oh, cool. Yeah."
199,00:14:01.47,00:14:01.47,">> I'm a real estate broker, butI'm going back to school,"
200,00:14:04.27,00:14:04.27,changing careers.>> Are you? For what?
201,00:14:06.13,00:14:06.13,>> Environmental studies.>> That's what I'm doing!
202,00:14:08.57,00:14:08.57,>> Come on.>> Get out of here!
203,00:14:10.03,00:14:10.03,>> Gina and Kathy right away hadsomething in common.
204,00:14:12.60,00:14:12.60,They're both all about theenvironment and want to go
205,00:14:15.13,00:14:15.13,hiking and do all that.So that was good.
206,00:14:17.13,00:14:17.13,Gina found someone right away.We have a morning show every
207,00:14:20.63,00:14:20.63,"morning.Sean is really, really funny."
208,00:14:22.63,00:14:22.63,We each had a part in themorning show.
209,00:14:24.67,00:14:24.67,"I was the beauty.She was the sports report,"
210,00:14:26.97,00:14:26.97,"Hunter was the, uh, helicopterweather guy."
211,00:14:29.20,00:14:29.20,>> Hunter's the one they votedoff last night.
212,00:14:31.60,00:14:31.60,>> Last night. I thought...we called him surfer boy.
213,00:14:34.40,00:14:34.40,"We thought he'd make it untilthe end, dude."
214,00:14:36.70,00:14:36.70,">> He was, yeah, he was strong,he was a hard worker."
215,00:14:39.20,00:14:39.20,He was everything.Just the four people decided
216,00:14:41.47,00:14:41.47,"just, for whatever reason to...>> Really?"
217,00:14:43.43,00:14:43.43,>> Yeah.>> Nicest guy in the world.
218,00:14:45.13,00:14:45.13,>> I thought the tribe that hadbeen here was lazy.
219,00:14:47.57,00:14:47.57,"And fortunately, those membersare no longer around, from what"
220,00:14:50.57,00:14:50.57,"I understand.Having said that, the fruit"
221,00:14:54.30,00:14:54.30,"situation over here, which wedid not have over there, has"
222,00:14:57.93,00:14:57.93,made everything just worthwhileso far.
223,00:15:00.43,00:15:00.43,"Oh, man!>> I'd rather eat this than fish"
224,00:15:02.97,00:15:02.97,any day.>> Cheers.
225,00:15:06.23,00:15:06.23,>> To our new little family.>> Nice little crib's better
226,00:15:23.83,00:15:23.83,than the projects.>> Yeah.
227,00:15:25.53,00:15:25.53,>> So what is the routine of theday?
228,00:15:27.90,00:15:27.90,What do you guys normally do?>> Up at dawn.
229,00:15:30.70,00:15:30.70,>> Make sure we have water andfood.
230,00:15:33.00,00:15:33.00,>> Okay.After the challenge we got
231,00:15:35.23,00:15:35.23,"three new tribe members.We got V, we got Rob and we got"
232,00:15:38.87,00:15:38.87,Sean.I couldn't have been happier
233,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,when they switched us up.I love the people that I was
234,00:15:44.80,00:15:44.80,"part of the first original eightwith, but I was also thrilled to"
235,00:15:47.90,00:15:47.90,get some new people in ourtribe.
236,00:15:49.47,00:15:49.47,">> This is our coconut popcorn.>> Oh, yeah, try that."
237,00:15:52.07,00:15:52.07,>> You gotta try that.It's really good.
238,00:15:53.97,00:15:53.97,>> You guys hungry?Want to get some taro cooking?
239,00:15:56.63,00:15:56.63,>> That has flavor to it!>> When we landed here on Rotu
240,00:16:00.80,00:16:00.80,"camp, I truly felt that therewas a genuine welcome."
241,00:16:05.33,00:16:05.33,But I also felt that theirexpectation was for us to just
242,00:16:10.30,00:16:10.30,jump right in.Because everybody was
243,00:16:13.27,00:16:13.27,immediately on their jobs.>> You guys want to go get some
244,00:16:15.93,00:16:15.93,limes?Will that be on the way to the
245,00:16:17.60,00:16:17.60,waterfall?>> We've been getting 40 limes a
246,00:16:19.57,00:16:19.57,"day, and we've been goingthrough them."
247,00:16:21.37,00:16:21.37,>> We noticed immediately thesepeople were like ants!
248,00:16:27.17,00:16:27.17,>> One.>> They were... and we're
249,00:16:30.67,00:16:30.67,"standing there like...right now we'd be chilling, you"
250,00:16:34.77,00:16:34.77,know?Work done in the morning.
251,00:16:37.10,00:16:37.10,"Afternoon, chill, the rest ofthe day."
252,00:16:39.97,00:16:39.97,"I tell you, at the other camp wenever even fired up our frying"
253,00:16:44.77,00:16:44.77,"pan.Everything was sliced, slurp,"
254,00:16:47.33,00:16:47.33,toss.>> Those are our nicknames.
255,00:16:49.50,00:16:49.50,>> Johnny Pots and Pans.Xena.
256,00:16:52.23,00:16:52.23,>> Tonga.>> Scoop.
257,00:16:53.20,00:16:53.20,">> The General.>> Scoop, Scoop and the"
258,00:16:55.23,00:16:55.23,"General, right.>> At this point, I'm really not"
259,00:16:57.97,00:16:57.97,sure how I'm going to overcomethe numerical advantage that
260,00:17:01.53,00:17:01.53,they hold.Having five members stay and us
261,00:17:04.00,00:17:04.00,being the three newcomers.The biggest thing now is going
262,00:17:07.37,00:17:07.37,to be to see how I'm going to beable to bond with these other
263,00:17:11.03,00:17:11.03,"people.Gabe seems pretty cool, he's"
264,00:17:15.33,00:17:15.33,definitely a brainiac.He probably thinks he's a lot
265,00:17:18.43,00:17:18.43,"smarter than he really is.When I first saw John, I thought"
266,00:17:22.00,00:17:22.00,"he was a big-time queer.I really don't know, he seems"
267,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,"kind of rough and tough overhere, but he does all the"
268,00:17:28.50,00:17:28.50,"cooking.So I don't know, I won't be"
269,00:17:30.63,00:17:30.63,"sleeping next to him tonight,not the first night, anyway."
270,00:17:34.13,00:17:34.13,"The General seems like a niceguy, also."
271,00:17:36.77,00:17:36.77,"He's big and tough, and wantseverybody to know that."
272,00:17:40.33,00:17:40.33,"Probably got a little sausage.Tammy is engaged, there's not"
273,00:17:45.07,00:17:45.07,"too much hope there.And Zoe is pretty nice, but..."
274,00:17:48.17,00:17:48.17,"come on.Without a doubt, Zoe is"
275,00:17:50.10,00:17:50.10,definitely the toughest guy inthis tribe.
276,00:17:52.67,00:17:52.67,I don't think this is the typeof group where I can jump in and
277,00:17:56.50,00:17:56.50,joke around and just be alloutlandish and stuff like I
278,00:17:59.87,00:17:59.87,"could in the other group.Definitely the game is changing,"
279,00:18:03.50,00:18:03.50,and maybe for the better.Maybe for the worse.
280,00:18:07.03,00:18:07.03,"I don't know.>> All right, the map!"
281,00:18:18.10,00:18:18.10,">> And I am embarrassed to say,I don't know how to pronounce"
282,00:18:20.27,00:18:20.27,this tribe.>> Maraamu.
283,00:18:22.40,00:18:22.40,>> Maraamu.>> Maraamu.
284,00:18:24.53,00:18:24.53,">> Is that...Where's your water, right there?"
285,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,Our water's way up here.>> We walked up the trail and
286,00:18:30.00,00:18:30.00,got water-- unbelievable toactually see somebody want to go
287,00:18:32.97,00:18:32.97,"get water.>> Go ahead, mama."
288,00:18:34.40,00:18:34.40,>> All rightie.>> So there is a new lease on
289,00:18:36.70,00:18:36.70,"life.I stayed with Maraamu, but I"
290,00:18:38.63,00:18:38.63,got three new tribe members thattotally kick butt.
291,00:18:42.33,00:18:42.33,">> Hunter and I, we got water,we got food, everything."
292,00:18:45.97,00:18:45.97,And he was so awesome.We had so much in common.
293,00:18:49.17,00:18:49.17,He was the nicest guy in theworld.
294,00:18:51.43,00:18:51.43,"I mean, I thought it was megoing last night."
295,00:18:54.17,00:18:54.17,"So, it shocked the hell out ofme."
296,00:18:56.20,00:18:56.20,"I mean, I can't believe they gotrid of Hunter, and then they"
297,00:18:59.93,00:18:59.93,jumped down my throat for askingwhy they did it.
298,00:19:03.00,00:19:03.00,"Lazy, lazy.This is our water, guys."
299,00:19:06.00,00:19:06.00,>> That's the water.>> You guys would die if you saw
300,00:19:09.83,00:19:09.83,where we got water from.(laughing)
301,00:19:13.50,00:19:13.50,"I'm in shock.Sorry, I usually jump in to"
302,00:19:15.80,00:19:15.80,jobs.>> But water is water when it's
303,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90,"boiled, so...>> Oh, no, I know."
304,00:19:19.73,00:19:19.73,It's just the exact opposite ofwhat we got.
305,00:19:22.23,00:19:22.23,Isn't that funny?It's very interesting being
306,00:19:24.80,00:19:24.80,away from Rotu.Because that tribe is just
307,00:19:27.20,00:19:27.20,"workaholics, and...It's just weird being here."
308,00:19:31.07,00:19:31.07,Because it's so kicked back.>> The guys are definitely going
309,00:19:34.60,00:19:34.60,"to be...>> Oh, the guys will be in"
310,00:19:36.13,00:19:36.13,"heaven.>> I don't know, there's not"
311,00:19:37.67,00:19:37.67,that much shellfish.>> We're very happy with what
312,00:19:39.87,00:19:39.87,has turned out to be.I know they're a little
313,00:19:41.83,00:19:41.83,disappointed because they had itso well and their tribe was so
314,00:19:44.60,00:19:44.60,"close, but since they have themajority of the people they"
315,00:19:47.13,00:19:47.13,could just pick off people oneach tribe.
316,00:19:48.90,00:19:48.90,And I definitely would not mindit if that happened on the other
317,00:19:51.73,00:19:51.73,side.They deserve what they get.
318,00:20:03.30,00:20:03.30,">> All right, so just startsome piles."
319,00:20:06.47,00:20:06.47,">> How much wood is this for,for the entire day we're"
320,00:20:10.13,00:20:10.13,collecting?>> Yeah.
321,00:20:27.63,00:20:27.63,">> Pretty much, life over hereis about two degrees shy of"
322,00:20:33.10,00:20:33.10,hell.It's absolutely terrible.
323,00:20:35.10,00:20:35.10,It's a night and day differencebetween the other camp.
324,00:20:38.77,00:20:38.77,"These people are workaholics,that's all they want to do."
325,00:20:42.57,00:20:42.57,They don't give you a second tobreathe.
326,00:20:45.03,00:20:45.03,Every two seconds somebody isasking you to do something else.
327,00:20:47.93,00:20:47.93,">> We can dig this one up, thisone's a good one, but we do need"
328,00:20:50.97,00:20:50.97,to make a new one.I don't like this one very much.
329,00:20:53.37,00:20:53.37,It's not steep enough.>> Why give in to this bull
330,00:20:58.00,00:20:58.00,crap?That's all it is.
331,00:21:09.23,00:21:09.23,">> Believe me, I workedconstruction for years, man."
332,00:21:12.33,00:21:12.33,I know what it's like to digditches.
333,00:21:14.53,00:21:14.53,>> Really?>> It's hard to do it with
334,00:21:16.73,00:21:16.73,"shovels, let alone with freakingoars and paddles, man."
335,00:21:20.03,00:21:20.03,>> I feel like we're doing toomuch labor on this island.
336,00:21:24.23,00:21:24.23,Definitely feel like the masteris watching.
337,00:21:26.90,00:21:26.90,"I'm like, slavery has been over.I feel like we're in the woods."
338,00:21:29.80,00:21:29.80,I hear the Roots theme as wespeak.
339,00:21:31.57,00:21:31.57,"Hear it?By the end of the night, I'm so"
340,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,"tired all I want to do is laydown, you know."
341,00:21:42.70,00:21:42.70,"I want to sit around the fire.So, Rob, how do you feel about"
342,00:21:51.77,00:21:51.77,"being over here?>> To tell you the truth, I"
343,00:21:54.90,00:21:54.90,really don't enjoy this part ofthe island.
344,00:21:58.10,00:21:58.10,"Yeah, the women over heredon't look half as good as they"
345,00:22:02.27,00:22:02.27,"did at our other tribe.>> Oh, no, the women on our"
346,00:22:05.77,00:22:05.77,island had big boobs with tinybikinis.
347,00:22:08.43,00:22:08.43,">> Over here, I think we goteight guys on the island."
348,00:22:12.17,00:22:12.17,We got eight guys and one girl.I think her name is John.
349,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,>> I don't know anything aboutthat one.
350,00:22:21.93,00:22:21.93,">> Ah, here's one of my favoritegirls right here."
351,00:22:25.27,00:22:25.27,"Hmm, Tammy?>> You just like me because I"
352,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,bring you food.>> That's right.
353,00:22:29.23,00:22:29.23,">> Take a handful, and I'llbring it over to the other guys."
354,00:22:32.27,00:22:32.27,>> Tammy knows the deal.>> Tammy knows what's up.
355,00:22:35.03,00:22:35.03,">> Thank you, Tammy.>> Thank you, babe."
356,00:22:37.23,00:22:37.23,">> You're welcome.>> Now see, see..."
357,00:22:40.73,00:22:40.73,>> We could've used heron the island.
358,00:22:43.13,00:22:43.13,">> She's all right.Long as she keeps serving,"
359,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,she'll do fine.>> Minute she stops...
360,00:22:48.80,00:22:48.80,>> See ya later.>> ...she's out.
361,00:22:51.77,00:22:51.77,">> If Sean and Rob decide not towork, we will still feed them,"
362,00:22:55.97,00:22:55.97,"but their asses will be gone,first vote."
363,00:23:00.17,00:23:00.17,">> Tomorrow, I think me and youshould go on a hike and"
364,00:23:02.97,00:23:02.97,"basically, what we'll do is,we'll go around that corner over"
365,00:23:06.10,00:23:06.10,"there, and we'll chill out allday."
366,00:23:08.67,00:23:08.67,"What do you think? Cool?>> This morning, we got up."
367,00:23:26.10,00:23:26.10,We started a little fire.Decided we were going to go for
368,00:23:29.37,00:23:29.37,"a hike.Filled up some water bottles,"
369,00:23:31.43,00:23:31.43,and then took off around thetrail.
370,00:23:33.43,00:23:33.43,"I look like I have the measles.>> You ready, pappy?"
371,00:23:35.93,00:23:35.93,">> I'm ready.>> All right, you want to carry"
372,00:23:38.13,00:23:38.13,"a water?>> Sarah, are you okay?"

374,00:23:59.20,00:23:59.20,She's a stroller.>> Kathy decided she was going
375,00:24:03.10,00:24:03.10,"to take lead, and somewherealong the way we missed a trail"
376,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,"or something, but we gotsidetracked and basically got"
377,00:24:09.60,00:24:09.60,"lost.>> Yeah, we're too high now."
378,00:24:11.63,00:24:11.63,We've got to traverse down.We're going to backtrack just to
379,00:24:15.30,00:24:15.30,"be safe, instead of slidingdown."
380,00:24:17.30,00:24:17.30,>> All right.>> Everybody enjoyed it up to a
381,00:24:20.03,00:24:20.03,point.And then I think people started
382,00:24:22.33,00:24:22.33,getting tired of the long hikeand wondering if we were getting
383,00:24:26.20,00:24:26.20,lost.They weren't used to
384,00:24:27.67,00:24:27.67,"bushwhacking.I was used to it, so I was"
385,00:24:29.97,00:24:29.97,feeling rather confident thatwe'll be okay.
386,00:24:32.50,00:24:32.50,We either go to the lagoon or wego back down and up and try to
387,00:24:36.17,00:24:36.17,find that trail.But why don't we move over a
388,00:24:38.77,00:24:38.77,little bit further?>> I'm game. Go ahead.
389,00:24:41.17,00:24:41.17,"Neleh and Paschal, I think, werevery irritated."
390,00:24:43.97,00:24:43.97,Sometimes I see that Kathy getson their nerves just because she
391,00:24:47.67,00:24:47.67,is so aggressive.And they're not aggressive
392,00:24:51.83,00:24:51.83,people; they're very passive.>> They're back there.
393,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,I'm not waiting. Sorry.>> They were irritated with her
394,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,"because she wanted to go on, andthat might tend to break down"
395,00:25:00.90,00:25:00.90,after a while their bond thatthey have.
396,00:25:08.77,00:25:08.77,">> It was hard going, somewhat.But we finally found this very,"
397,00:25:12.20,00:25:12.20,"very deep rock pool.>> There is the biggest shrimp,"
398,00:25:15.07,00:25:15.07,"you guys.>> Look at that shrimp, you"
399,00:25:17.07,00:25:17.07,"guys, hurry, look.>> It's huge."
400,00:25:18.80,00:25:18.80,">> Oh, my God.I don't know if that is."
401,00:25:20.93,00:25:20.93,Is that a shrimp?>> Yeah.
402,00:25:22.33,00:25:22.33,>> It's a shrimp.>> Whoa!
403,00:25:23.77,00:25:23.77,>> There's five huge ones rightthere.
404,00:25:26.07,00:25:26.07,">> We found a bubbling brook,and there was a pool there with"
405,00:25:29.77,00:25:29.77,"pretty good-sized shrimp, maybe,you know, three-to-four-inch"
406,00:25:33.47,00:25:33.47,size shrimp.Neleh decided it would be nice
407,00:25:36.07,00:25:36.07,"to try and catch some shrimps.>> Oh, wow, there's a nice one."
408,00:25:40.87,00:25:40.87,>> Dang it!>> Sarah basically just sat on
409,00:25:45.67,00:25:45.67,"the shore the whole timescratching her legs, and really"
410,00:25:48.87,00:25:48.87,not doing much of anything tohelp with the food situation.
411,00:25:52.23,00:25:52.23,>> I'll see you guys in a littlebit.
412,00:25:54.03,00:25:54.03,>> All right. Be careful.>> See you.
413,00:25:55.87,00:25:55.87,>> Sarah decided that she wasgetting eaten pretty bad by the
414,00:26:00.37,00:26:00.37,"no-nos, so she decided shewanted to leave and head on back"
415,00:26:04.67,00:26:04.67,"to camp.We truly didn't care, she wasn't"
416,00:26:07.43,00:26:07.43,"doing anything, anyway.>> I have lost an extreme amount"
417,00:26:10.33,00:26:10.33,"of weight, and I'm getting veryweak and the bug bites are"
418,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,driving me absolutely insane.I thought I was going to come
419,00:26:16.43,00:26:16.43,back to camp and cut my legs offwith a machete.
420,00:26:19.13,00:26:19.13,">> Gina, can you hear me?>> Sarah's lost."
421,00:26:21.87,00:26:21.87,>> How far up here is the trail?Do you remember?
422,00:26:25.07,00:26:25.07,>> I don't even know whereyou're at.
423,00:26:27.47,00:26:27.47,"Sarah basically just couldn'tfind her way back, so she came"
424,00:26:31.43,00:26:31.43,"back.>> Apparently, I'm not going"
425,00:26:33.63,00:26:33.63,anywhere.>> Sarah likes to sit back.
426,00:26:36.03,00:26:36.03,I think that's probably herthing-- she doesn't participate.
427,00:26:40.00,00:26:40.00,"But Neleh, and Paschal andobviously Gina and myself are"
428,00:26:43.67,00:26:43.67,willing to explore and get somefood other than just plucking it
429,00:26:47.90,00:26:47.90,off a tree.>> Yes!
430,00:26:49.63,00:26:49.63,>> Got another one?>> Two.
431,00:26:51.30,00:26:51.30,>> She got two nice ones.(squeals)
432,00:27:15.07,00:27:15.07,">> Guys, how is it?>> Great, thank you."
433,00:27:17.53,00:27:17.53,>> Want a little bit more?>> Yeah.
434,00:27:19.33,00:27:19.33,Thank you so much.>> You're welcome.
435,00:27:22.33,00:27:22.33,">> Thank you, Tammy.>> I'm telling you, as your"
436,00:27:33.00,00:27:33.00,"friend, man, they're alreadyfive strong."
437,00:27:35.33,00:27:35.33,"And their group... their groupis real tight, I mean..."
438,00:27:38.50,00:27:38.50,What we can do is win the nextchallenges and ensure that we
439,00:27:41.97,00:27:41.97,"stay here, but me you and V aregoing to get picked off one by"
440,00:27:45.57,00:27:45.57,"one, anyway.>> Whoo!"
441,00:27:46.63,00:27:46.63,>> These five have been herebefore us.
442,00:27:48.73,00:27:48.73,"They're a strong knit group,we're going to be the first to"
443,00:27:51.93,00:27:51.93,go if they have to vote anyway.So there's nothing you can do to
444,00:27:55.40,00:27:55.40,"try to prove yourself.And if you don't kiss butt, like"
445,00:27:59.03,00:27:59.03,"I don't plan to do, then youjust know that your butt is"
446,00:28:01.67,00:28:01.67,"next.If I'm the next one voted off,"
447,00:28:03.30,00:28:03.30,"so be it.But I tell you, I can't hold my"
448,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,mouth for too long.They are definitely going to
449,00:28:07.37,00:28:07.37,know where Sean is coming from.We're not going to overexert
450,00:28:10.13,00:28:10.13,ourselves knowing we're cominginto a situation where we may
451,00:28:12.87,00:28:12.87,get voted off anyway.We're not trying to prove
452,00:28:15.00,00:28:15.00,"nothing.We're trying to fit in, have fun"
453,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,while we do it.And whatever game y'all five got
454,00:28:19.07,00:28:19.07,"going...>> Listen, listen, I want you"

456,00:28:23.33,00:28:23.33,"you're going to think.>> I hear you, but the thing is,"
457,00:28:25.83,00:28:25.83,we're not going to run aroundhere like slaves to prove
458,00:28:28.37,00:28:28.37,anything to anybody.That's why we're going to rest

608,00:36:08.43,00:36:08.43,"The one vote that I probablywill have will be for Kathy, and"
609,00:36:11.73,00:36:11.73,it's because she's been veryoverbearing and motherly to me.
610,00:36:15.33,00:36:15.33,"Even though that may just be herpersonality, I don't know how"
611,00:36:17.97,00:36:17.97,long I could stand that.>> Fire's done.
