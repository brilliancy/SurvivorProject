2,00:00:02.07,00:00:02.07, Survivor: Injuries plagued Rotu while
3,00:00:04.30,00:00:04.30,"building their raft. >> Nice work, butcher."
4,00:00:06.27,00:00:06.27,">> Okay, okay, okay. >> PROBST: Go!"
5,00:00:07.83,00:00:07.83,"But it all paid off in the end, as their raft led them to"
6,00:00:10.47,00:00:10.47,victory at the reward challenge. Rotu!
7,00:00:12.23,00:00:12.23,(cheering) Taking advantage of Maraamu's
8,00:00:14.57,00:00:14.57,"low morale, Rob strategized behind the scenes, and was the"
9,00:00:17.93,00:00:17.93,puppet master of the tribe. >> Fear keeps people loyal.
10,00:00:20.80,00:00:20.80,"If they're afraid they have something to lose, they're going"
11,00:00:23.60,00:00:23.60,to do what I tell them to do and not know that I'm telling them
12,00:00:26.57,00:00:26.57,to do it. That's straight out of The
13,00:00:28.23,00:00:28.23, Godfather. >> PROBST: Rotu remained
14,00:00:30.93,00:00:30.93,untouchable with another victory at the immunity challenge.
15,00:00:35.03,00:00:35.03,Immunity. (cheering)
16,00:00:36.37,00:00:36.37,"Nice job. At Tribal Council,"
17,00:00:38.03,00:00:38.03,Maraamu followed Rob's lead and voted Hunter off the island.
18,00:00:41.37,00:00:41.37,">> Good luck, you guys. >> PROBST: The tribe has spoken."
19,00:00:46.27,00:00:46.27,13 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
20,00:02:12.40,00:02:12.40,"(indistinct voices) >> Without a doubt, I think this"
21,00:02:19.10,00:02:19.10,"is my game, and I'm the one that's controlling it, for the"
22,00:02:21.90,00:02:21.90,most part. I don't think Hunter saw it
23,00:02:25.20,00:02:25.20,coming a mile away. >> Need some more... more
24,00:02:28.43,00:02:28.43,stuff. >> Last night at Tribal Council
25,00:02:33.17,00:02:33.17,"the four other members decided to vote out Hunter, which I"
26,00:02:37.27,00:02:37.27,think was a pretty stupid idea. >> There you go.
27,00:02:40.33,00:02:40.33,You got it. >> I think the reason being is
28,00:02:42.53,00:02:42.53,because Rob and Sean were tired of having somebody else in a
29,00:02:45.67,00:02:45.67,"leadership role, and now they're ready to take over."
30,00:02:48.37,00:02:48.37,"You can see it in what they do. I mean, we come back and we got"
31,00:02:51.67,00:02:51.67,to build a fire. And I think that was their main
32,00:02:54.20,00:02:54.20,motivation in getting him off. I thought I was the one gone.
33,00:02:58.43,00:02:58.43,I just want to know why you vote one of your strongest members
34,00:03:02.93,00:03:02.93,out. >> I think we all probably had a
35,00:03:04.80,00:03:04.80,different reason. >> I mean I'm glad I'm here.
36,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,>> Uh-huh. >> 'Cause I thought I was going.
37,00:03:09.30,00:03:09.30,"But I'm just, I'm really just shocked."
38,00:03:11.23,00:03:11.23,>> Basically just kind of do something different.
39,00:03:13.70,00:03:13.70,I'm just like not the big picture.
40,00:03:15.43,00:03:15.43,"I mean, the game has no rules. >> I know, I mean, we talked,"
41,00:03:18.53,00:03:18.53,and I told you why we voted on each other.
42,00:03:20.93,00:03:20.93,"So I just, if you guys want to tell me, that's fine."
43,00:03:23.93,00:03:23.93,"If not, then, that's fine, too. I'm just asking."
44,00:03:26.70,00:03:26.70,"Nobody had a good explanation, no one."
45,00:03:28.50,00:03:28.50,"Sarah's explanation was she just felt like, you know, she had two"
46,00:03:31.67,00:03:31.67,people and that's who she wanted to vote on.
47,00:03:33.80,00:03:33.80,"Well, Rob voted on that person, that's why she voted on him."
48,00:03:36.70,00:03:36.70,"She doesn't think for herself, Rob tells her what to vote on."
49,00:03:40.27,00:03:40.27,">> I don't know, it's hard to explain what I was thinking."
50,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,You thought you were the one to go?
51,00:03:45.43,00:03:45.43,">> I mean, I thought it would be stupid to vote him out."
52,00:03:48.30,00:03:48.30,>> I'm glad I voted the way I did.
53,00:03:50.47,00:03:50.47,">> After seeing the votes I'm glad I voted the way I did, too."
54,00:03:52.77,00:03:52.77,>> They think it's the beginning of Maraamu-- I have no idea.
55,00:03:55.77,00:03:55.77,"I hope it's not the end, because I don't want to go."
56,00:03:58.37,00:03:58.37,"I'll be the next to go. If we lose, I'm gone."
57,00:04:00.67,00:04:00.67,They're not going to keep somebody like me around.
58,00:04:17.80,00:04:17.80,>> This is a big pig tail in the back.
59,00:04:19.77,00:04:19.77,>> A big pig tail? >> A big braided pig tail.
60,00:04:22.13,00:04:22.13,">> Yeah, like a Barbie doll thing."
61,00:04:23.93,00:04:23.93,">> Oh, yeah. Perfect."
62,00:04:26.17,00:04:26.17,">> Let me see. There you go! >> Thanks, babe."
63,00:04:28.50,00:04:28.50,">> I jammed. >> You did, you did a great job."
64,00:04:31.73,00:04:31.73,">> No lumps. >> Good morning, buddy."
65,00:04:34.20,00:04:34.20,>> This tribe is a family. We've said that from day one.
66,00:04:37.80,00:04:37.80,I don't know that the mood could be any better.
67,00:04:41.77,00:04:41.77,"It's just a real calm, peaceful feeling."
68,00:04:45.67,00:04:45.67,"It's just family pride here, and I don't think the other team has"
69,00:04:49.43,00:04:49.43,that. >> I think as every day
70,00:04:51.40,00:04:51.40,"passes here, I think our tribe is beginning to find more of its"
71,00:04:55.07,00:04:55.07,groove. People are beginning to relax a
72,00:04:57.00,00:04:57.00,"little bit. I mean, yesterday was honestly"
73,00:04:59.13,00:04:59.13,the best day I've had here. >> Yeah.
74,00:05:02.13,00:05:02.13,">> Hey, buddy. >> This tribe is unbelievable."
75,00:05:04.73,00:05:04.73,The reason we keep winning is because of the unity and love
76,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17,that is in this tribe. It's an unreal experience to see
77,00:05:12.37,00:05:12.37,eight people coming together every single day to provide for
78,00:05:16.27,00:05:16.27,"each other, not just rally around each other for a"
79,00:05:19.50,00:05:19.50,"challenge, but every single day doing an activity that will"
80,00:05:23.30,00:05:23.30,provide for the rest of the group.
81,00:05:27.80,00:05:27.80,>> I am preparing toasted coconut.
82,00:05:31.07,00:05:31.07,"There was a discovery last night by the infamous, infamous Chef,"
83,00:05:35.53,00:05:35.53,"John, to try and make our food taste better, and we just"
84,00:05:39.47,00:05:39.47,happened to discover that the coconut just got burned on the
85,00:05:43.67,00:05:43.67,bottom of the pan and it tasted really good.
86,00:05:46.93,00:05:46.93,">> Survivor snacks. It's warm, so be careful."
87,00:05:51.03,00:05:51.03,Is it good? >> Oh!
88,00:05:52.77,00:05:52.77,Let's just make that every two hours on the two hours.
89,00:05:57.40,00:05:57.40,">> The bottom line is, everybody in this tribe likes each other"
90,00:06:02.00,00:06:02.00,and respects each other as individuals.
91,00:06:04.80,00:06:04.80,"Whether we wanted it or not, we've become a second sort of"
92,00:06:08.47,00:06:08.47,"family. And it's a good thing, it works"
93,00:06:10.93,00:06:10.93,for us. >> We have mail!
94,00:06:38.07,00:06:38.07,>> Okay. Here we go. Listen up.
95,00:06:42.20,00:06:42.20,"""Challenges of brain and brawn are nothing compared to this."
96,00:06:47.80,00:06:47.80,"Your world will turn, your head will spin, as you stand upon the"
97,00:06:53.80,00:06:53.80,"disk."" >> Might be like a wheel of"
98,00:06:56.77,00:06:56.77,fortune. >> Into the water?
99,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,>> Could be like if you get dizzy or not.
100,00:07:00.87,00:07:00.87,">> Mm-hmm. >> Today's mail was a disk, it"
101,00:07:03.03,00:07:03.03,"was a wooden disk. We kind of, like, threw some"
102,00:07:05.50,00:07:05.50,"ideas around, but then we decided we're just going to shut"
103,00:07:08.40,00:07:08.40,"up and wait. In a nutshell, we've assumed"
104,00:07:11.73,00:07:11.73,every single one. We have been wrong on every
105,00:07:13.73,00:07:13.73,single one. So maybe today when we go in
106,00:07:15.47,00:07:15.47,"there, expecting the unexpected, who knows?"
107,00:07:17.57,00:07:17.57,>> Here's where the game gets really interesting.
108,00:07:32.33,00:07:32.33,">> PROBST: Hello, guys. >> Hello."
109,00:07:34.80,00:07:34.80,>> What's up? >> PROBST: All right.
110,00:07:40.73,00:07:40.73,"Today is not a reward challenge or an immunity challenge, but it"
111,00:07:44.10,00:07:44.10,"is an activity of sorts, and certainly some of you will be"
112,00:07:47.13,00:07:47.13,"rewarded and others no doubt, as always, will go back"
113,00:07:49.93,00:07:49.93,disappointed. Let's begin.
114,00:07:56.73,00:07:56.73,"Okay. First step, pick a disk, doesn't"
115,00:08:00.23,00:08:00.23,"matter, it's totally random. Follow your gut."
116,00:08:02.83,00:08:02.83,Go wherever you want. Okay.
117,00:08:22.20,00:08:22.20,"Zoe, you're first. Step off your disk."
118,00:08:24.13,00:08:24.13,Flip it over. Pull off your new buff.
119,00:08:29.37,00:08:29.37,Take your old one off. Put your new one on.
120,00:08:31.23,00:08:31.23,"Nothing changes for you, you're still on Rotu."
121,00:08:36.90,00:08:36.90,"Put it on, and take a spot over here."
122,00:08:50.70,00:08:50.70,"Gina, you're next. No harm, no foul, still with"
123,00:08:56.90,00:08:56.90,Maraamu. Gabe.
124,00:09:08.47,00:09:08.47,Pick a spot on your new mat. You're still Rotu.
125,00:09:14.07,00:09:14.07,Neleh. First change.
126,00:09:20.80,00:09:20.80,Now part of Maraamu. Take a spot on the mat with
127,00:09:23.17,00:09:23.17,Gina. >> Welcome.
128,00:09:27.20,00:09:27.20,>> PROBST: John. No change.
129,00:09:32.80,00:09:32.80,You're still with Rotu. Take a spot on the mat.
130,00:09:35.80,00:09:35.80,"V... here goes. Swap out, you're now a member of"
131,00:09:43.77,00:09:43.77,"Rotu. >> God is still good,"
132,00:09:46.47,00:09:46.47,regardless. >> PROBST: Say hi to your new
133,00:09:48.90,00:09:48.90,"tribe members. >> What's up, babies?"
134,00:09:50.70,00:09:50.70,>> PROBST: Rob. You're now a member of Rotu.
135,00:10:01.97,00:10:01.97,">> Hi, Robster. >> PROBST: Kathy..."
136,00:10:08.60,00:10:08.60,you're now a member of Maraamu. Say hello to your new tribe
137,00:10:13.47,00:10:13.47,mates. Sean.
138,00:10:22.20,00:10:22.20,"You're now a member of Rotu. >> Sean, man."
139,00:10:27.30,00:10:27.30,>> John. >> PROBST: Sarah.
140,00:10:35.33,00:10:35.33,"Okay, Sarah, same buff, still a member of Maraamu."
141,00:10:40.67,00:10:40.67,">> What's up, ladies? >> The chicks, man!"
142,00:10:42.73,00:10:42.73,The chicks are here! >> It's all about the chicks.
143,00:10:45.23,00:10:45.23,">> Yes, Sarah, Kathy, Neleh. >> PROBST: Robert, you're up."
144,00:10:52.20,00:10:52.20,You're a member of Rotu. The new Rotu.
145,00:10:56.17,00:10:56.17,">> Hey, Rob. >> What's up, man?"
146,00:11:00.60,00:11:00.60,">> What's up, man? >> It's going to be all women."
147,00:11:03.20,00:11:03.20,>> Mm-hmm. >> PROBST: Paschal.
148,00:11:07.90,00:11:07.90,">> All right! >> Yeah, pappy's on our team!"
149,00:11:11.07,00:11:11.07,>> We got pappy. >> PROBST: You're now a member
150,00:11:13.57,00:11:13.57,of Maraamu. >> Nice to meet you.
151,00:11:20.93,00:11:20.93,">> You, too. >> PROBST: All right, Tammy,"
152,00:11:23.87,00:11:23.87,you're last. Join your new tribe.
153,00:11:30.53,00:11:30.53,">> What's up, tribe? >> What's up, sweetie?"
154,00:11:32.70,00:11:32.70,>> So good! It's good to get to know new
155,00:11:35.20,00:11:35.20,"people. >> Welcome, guys. How you doing?"
156,00:11:37.77,00:11:37.77,>> PROBST: All right. These are the new tribes.
157,00:11:40.53,00:11:40.53,"Maraamu, Rotu. The number of tribe members in"
158,00:11:43.20,00:11:43.20,"each tribe hasn't changed, just the members within the tribe."
159,00:11:46.80,00:11:46.80,"And let me assure you that like everything else in this game,"
160,00:11:50.43,00:11:50.43,this part of your destiny was planned long before you guys
161,00:11:53.87,00:11:53.87,even got to the Marquesas Islands.
162,00:11:55.90,00:11:55.90,I have no doubt that some of you are probably looking at this as
163,00:12:00.10,00:12:00.10,"a reprieve, others may see it as a sentence."
164,00:12:03.03,00:12:03.03,It is neither. It's just the game.
165,00:12:05.43,00:12:05.43,I'll see you guys tomorrow. >> What's your name? Tammy?
166,00:12:09.83,00:12:09.83,>> I'm Rob. >> Rob.
167,00:12:11.23,00:12:11.23,>> Sean. >> Nice to meet you.
168,00:12:14.50,00:12:14.50,">> Sean, baby. (sobbing gently)"
169,00:12:20.13,00:12:20.13,">> It's good, it's good. >> Oh, my God."
170,00:12:35.70,00:12:35.70,">> This is our new house, you guys."
171,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17,>> This is so beautiful. >> Let's show you guys around.
172,00:12:40.47,00:12:40.47,">> What is this here? >> This is the breadfruit, this"
173,00:12:43.63,00:12:43.63,is a mango tree. >> When we got back for the
174,00:12:46.73,00:12:46.73,"first time the new group, it was interesting, we walked around"
175,00:12:49.30,00:12:49.30,and showed them the fruit trees that we had.
176,00:12:51.07,00:12:51.07,So all you got to do is pick up the limes off the ground.
177,00:12:53.43,00:12:53.43,>> There's a rooster. >> Their limes are on the
178,00:12:55.33,00:12:55.33,"ground! Hello! >> Yeah, there's a rooster."
179,00:12:57.07,00:12:57.07,It was very exhilarating to actually see some people who
180,00:13:00.13,00:13:00.13,didn't want to just sit around and be lazy.
181,00:13:02.30,00:13:02.30,">> You guys, check out this grapefruit tree!"
182,00:13:04.57,00:13:04.57,There's zillions of them. (laughing)
183,00:13:07.20,00:13:07.20,>> Strawberries. >> Oh!
184,00:13:11.90,00:13:11.90,>> Watch your head! >> Whoo-whee!
185,00:13:16.17,00:13:16.17,">> I just came from a tribe that would get up at dawn, check the"
186,00:13:19.73,00:13:19.73,"pig pit, you know, and go out and forage for shells."
187,00:13:22.67,00:13:22.67,"So to us we feel like we're at a four-star hotel, that there's"
188,00:13:26.13,00:13:26.13,fruit on the table. So it's pretty nice.
189,00:13:29.10,00:13:29.10,">> You guys, look at all the fruit!"
190,00:13:31.37,00:13:31.37,(indistinct voices) >> Didn't you say you have
191,00:13:37.07,00:13:37.07,"mangos, too? >> Oh, heck, you guys."
192,00:13:39.07,00:13:39.07,Grapefruit just made my whole entire day.
193,00:13:41.43,00:13:41.43,">> It was nice to get away, you know, and see some new scenery."
194,00:13:45.13,00:13:45.13,The beach here is beautiful. And the fruit definitely by far
195,00:13:48.63,00:13:48.63,outdoes everything over at Rotu. I would have chosen here over
196,00:13:51.80,00:13:51.80,"that place for the fruit. >> So, what do you all do in"
197,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,real life? >> I was a teacher until this
198,00:13:57.07,00:13:57.07,"year, and then I took off. I'm bartending, saving money for"
199,00:13:59.93,00:13:59.93,"grad school. >> Oh, cool. Yeah."
200,00:14:01.47,00:14:01.47,">> I'm a real estate broker, but I'm going back to school,"
201,00:14:04.27,00:14:04.27,changing careers. >> Are you? For what?
202,00:14:06.13,00:14:06.13,>> Environmental studies. >> That's what I'm doing!
203,00:14:08.57,00:14:08.57,>> Come on. >> Get out of here!
204,00:14:10.03,00:14:10.03,>> Gina and Kathy right away had something in common.
205,00:14:12.60,00:14:12.60,They're both all about the environment and want to go
206,00:14:15.13,00:14:15.13,hiking and do all that. So that was good.
207,00:14:17.13,00:14:17.13,Gina found someone right away. We have a morning show every
208,00:14:20.63,00:14:20.63,"morning. Sean is really, really funny."
209,00:14:22.63,00:14:22.63,We each had a part in the morning show.
210,00:14:24.67,00:14:24.67,"I was the beauty. She was the sports report,"
211,00:14:26.97,00:14:26.97,"Hunter was the, uh, helicopter weather guy."
212,00:14:29.20,00:14:29.20,>> Hunter's the one they voted off last night.
213,00:14:31.60,00:14:31.60,>> Last night. I thought... we called him surfer boy.
214,00:14:34.40,00:14:34.40,"We thought he'd make it until the end, dude."
215,00:14:36.70,00:14:36.70,">> He was, yeah, he was strong, he was a hard worker."
216,00:14:39.20,00:14:39.20,He was everything. Just the four people decided
217,00:14:41.47,00:14:41.47,"just, for whatever reason to... >> Really?"
218,00:14:43.43,00:14:43.43,>> Yeah. >> Nicest guy in the world.
219,00:14:45.13,00:14:45.13,>> I thought the tribe that had been here was lazy.
220,00:14:47.57,00:14:47.57,"And fortunately, those members are no longer around, from what"
221,00:14:50.57,00:14:50.57,"I understand. Having said that, the fruit"
222,00:14:54.30,00:14:54.30,"situation over here, which we did not have over there, has"
223,00:14:57.93,00:14:57.93,made everything just worthwhile so far.
224,00:15:00.43,00:15:00.43,"Oh, man! >> I'd rather eat this than fish"
225,00:15:02.97,00:15:02.97,any day. >> Cheers.
226,00:15:06.23,00:15:06.23,>> To our new little family. >> Nice little crib's better
227,00:15:23.83,00:15:23.83,than the projects. >> Yeah.
228,00:15:25.53,00:15:25.53,>> So what is the routine of the day?
229,00:15:27.90,00:15:27.90,What do you guys normally do? >> Up at dawn.
230,00:15:30.70,00:15:30.70,>> Make sure we have water and food.
231,00:15:33.00,00:15:33.00,>> Okay. After the challenge we got
232,00:15:35.23,00:15:35.23,"three new tribe members. We got V, we got Rob and we got"
233,00:15:38.87,00:15:38.87,Sean. I couldn't have been happier
234,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,when they switched us up. I love the people that I was
235,00:15:44.80,00:15:44.80,"part of the first original eight with, but I was also thrilled to"
236,00:15:47.90,00:15:47.90,get some new people in our tribe.
237,00:15:49.47,00:15:49.47,">> This is our coconut popcorn. >> Oh, yeah, try that."
238,00:15:52.07,00:15:52.07,>> You gotta try that. It's really good.
239,00:15:53.97,00:15:53.97,>> You guys hungry? Want to get some taro cooking?
240,00:15:56.63,00:15:56.63,>> That has flavor to it! >> When we landed here on Rotu
241,00:16:00.80,00:16:00.80,"camp, I truly felt that there was a genuine welcome."
242,00:16:05.33,00:16:05.33,But I also felt that their expectation was for us to just
243,00:16:10.30,00:16:10.30,jump right in. Because everybody was
244,00:16:13.27,00:16:13.27,immediately on their jobs. >> You guys want to go get some
245,00:16:15.93,00:16:15.93,limes? Will that be on the way to the
246,00:16:17.60,00:16:17.60,waterfall? >> We've been getting 40 limes a
247,00:16:19.57,00:16:19.57,"day, and we've been going through them."
248,00:16:21.37,00:16:21.37,>> We noticed immediately these people were like ants!
249,00:16:27.17,00:16:27.17,>> One. >> They were... and we're
250,00:16:30.67,00:16:30.67,"standing there like... right now we'd be chilling, you"
251,00:16:34.77,00:16:34.77,know? Work done in the morning.
252,00:16:37.10,00:16:37.10,"Afternoon, chill, the rest of the day."
253,00:16:39.97,00:16:39.97,"I tell you, at the other camp we never even fired up our frying"
254,00:16:44.77,00:16:44.77,"pan. Everything was sliced, slurp,"
255,00:16:47.33,00:16:47.33,toss. >> Those are our nicknames.
256,00:16:49.50,00:16:49.50,>> Johnny Pots and Pans. Xena.
257,00:16:52.23,00:16:52.23,>> Tonga. >> Scoop.
258,00:16:53.20,00:16:53.20,">> The General. >> Scoop, Scoop and the"
259,00:16:55.23,00:16:55.23,"General, right. >> At this point, I'm really not"
260,00:16:57.97,00:16:57.97,sure how I'm going to overcome the numerical advantage that
261,00:17:01.53,00:17:01.53,they hold. Having five members stay and us
262,00:17:04.00,00:17:04.00,being the three newcomers. The biggest thing now is going
263,00:17:07.37,00:17:07.37,to be to see how I'm going to be able to bond with these other
264,00:17:11.03,00:17:11.03,"people. Gabe seems pretty cool, he's"
265,00:17:15.33,00:17:15.33,definitely a brainiac. He probably thinks he's a lot
266,00:17:18.43,00:17:18.43,"smarter than he really is. When I first saw John, I thought"
267,00:17:22.00,00:17:22.00,"he was a big-time queer. I really don't know, he seems"
268,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,"kind of rough and tough over here, but he does all the"
269,00:17:28.50,00:17:28.50,"cooking. So I don't know, I won't be"
270,00:17:30.63,00:17:30.63,"sleeping next to him tonight, not the first night, anyway."
271,00:17:34.13,00:17:34.13,"The General seems like a nice guy, also."
272,00:17:36.77,00:17:36.77,"He's big and tough, and wants everybody to know that."
273,00:17:40.33,00:17:40.33,"Probably got a little sausage. Tammy is engaged, there's not"
274,00:17:45.07,00:17:45.07,"too much hope there. And Zoe is pretty nice, but..."
275,00:17:48.17,00:17:48.17,"come on. Without a doubt, Zoe is"
276,00:17:50.10,00:17:50.10,definitely the toughest guy in this tribe.
277,00:17:52.67,00:17:52.67,I don't think this is the type of group where I can jump in and
278,00:17:56.50,00:17:56.50,joke around and just be all outlandish and stuff like I
279,00:17:59.87,00:17:59.87,"could in the other group. Definitely the game is changing,"
280,00:18:03.50,00:18:03.50,and maybe for the better. Maybe for the worse.
281,00:18:07.03,00:18:07.03,"I don't know. >> All right, the map!"
282,00:18:18.10,00:18:18.10,">> And I am embarrassed to say, I don't know how to pronounce"
283,00:18:20.27,00:18:20.27,this tribe. >> Maraamu.
284,00:18:22.40,00:18:22.40,>> Maraamu. >> Maraamu.
285,00:18:24.53,00:18:24.53,">> Is that... Where's your water, right there?"
286,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,Our water's way up here. >> We walked up the trail and
287,00:18:30.00,00:18:30.00,got water-- unbelievable to actually see somebody want to go
288,00:18:32.97,00:18:32.97,"get water. >> Go ahead, mama."
289,00:18:34.40,00:18:34.40,>> All rightie. >> So there is a new lease on
290,00:18:36.70,00:18:36.70,"life. I stayed with Maraamu, but I"
291,00:18:38.63,00:18:38.63,got three new tribe members that totally kick butt.
292,00:18:42.33,00:18:42.33,">> Hunter and I, we got water, we got food, everything."
293,00:18:45.97,00:18:45.97,And he was so awesome. We had so much in common.
294,00:18:49.17,00:18:49.17,He was the nicest guy in the world.
295,00:18:51.43,00:18:51.43,"I mean, I thought it was me going last night."
296,00:18:54.17,00:18:54.17,"So, it shocked the hell out of me."
297,00:18:56.20,00:18:56.20,"I mean, I can't believe they got rid of Hunter, and then they"
298,00:18:59.93,00:18:59.93,jumped down my throat for asking why they did it.
299,00:19:03.00,00:19:03.00,"Lazy, lazy. This is our water, guys."
300,00:19:06.00,00:19:06.00,>> That's the water. >> You guys would die if you saw
301,00:19:09.83,00:19:09.83,where we got water from. (laughing)
302,00:19:13.50,00:19:13.50,"I'm in shock. Sorry, I usually jump in to"
303,00:19:15.80,00:19:15.80,jobs. >> But water is water when it's
304,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90,"boiled, so... >> Oh, no, I know."
305,00:19:19.73,00:19:19.73,It's just the exact opposite of what we got.
306,00:19:22.23,00:19:22.23,Isn't that funny? It's very interesting being
307,00:19:24.80,00:19:24.80,away from Rotu. Because that tribe is just
308,00:19:27.20,00:19:27.20,"workaholics, and... It's just weird being here."
309,00:19:31.07,00:19:31.07,Because it's so kicked back. >> The guys are definitely going
310,00:19:34.60,00:19:34.60,"to be... >> Oh, the guys will be in"
311,00:19:36.13,00:19:36.13,"heaven. >> I don't know, there's not"
312,00:19:37.67,00:19:37.67,that much shellfish. >> We're very happy with what
313,00:19:39.87,00:19:39.87,has turned out to be. I know they're a little
314,00:19:41.83,00:19:41.83,disappointed because they had it so well and their tribe was so
315,00:19:44.60,00:19:44.60,"close, but since they have the majority of the people they"
316,00:19:47.13,00:19:47.13,could just pick off people on each tribe.
317,00:19:48.90,00:19:48.90,And I definitely would not mind it if that happened on the other
318,00:19:51.73,00:19:51.73,side. They deserve what they get.
319,00:20:03.30,00:20:03.30,">> All right, so just start some piles."
320,00:20:06.47,00:20:06.47,">> How much wood is this for, for the entire day we're"
321,00:20:10.13,00:20:10.13,collecting? >> Yeah.
322,00:20:27.63,00:20:27.63,">> Pretty much, life over here is about two degrees shy of"
323,00:20:33.10,00:20:33.10,hell. It's absolutely terrible.
324,00:20:35.10,00:20:35.10,It's a night and day difference between the other camp.
325,00:20:38.77,00:20:38.77,"These people are workaholics, that's all they want to do."
326,00:20:42.57,00:20:42.57,They don't give you a second to breathe.
327,00:20:45.03,00:20:45.03,Every two seconds somebody is asking you to do something else.
328,00:20:47.93,00:20:47.93,">> We can dig this one up, this one's a good one, but we do need"
329,00:20:50.97,00:20:50.97,to make a new one. I don't like this one very much.
330,00:20:53.37,00:20:53.37,It's not steep enough. >> Why give in to this bull
331,00:20:58.00,00:20:58.00,crap? That's all it is.
332,00:21:09.23,00:21:09.23,">> Believe me, I worked construction for years, man."
333,00:21:12.33,00:21:12.33,I know what it's like to dig ditches.
334,00:21:14.53,00:21:14.53,>> Really? >> It's hard to do it with
335,00:21:16.73,00:21:16.73,"shovels, let alone with freaking oars and paddles, man."
336,00:21:20.03,00:21:20.03,>> I feel like we're doing too much labor on this island.
337,00:21:24.23,00:21:24.23,Definitely feel like the master is watching.
338,00:21:26.90,00:21:26.90,"I'm like, slavery has been over. I feel like we're in the woods."
339,00:21:29.80,00:21:29.80,I hear the Roots theme as we speak.
340,00:21:31.57,00:21:31.57,"Hear it? By the end of the night, I'm so"
341,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,"tired all I want to do is lay down, you know."
342,00:21:42.70,00:21:42.70,"I want to sit around the fire. So, Rob, how do you feel about"
343,00:21:51.77,00:21:51.77,"being over here? >> To tell you the truth, I"
344,00:21:54.90,00:21:54.90,really don't enjoy this part of the island.
345,00:21:58.10,00:21:58.10,"Yeah, the women over here don't look half as good as they"
346,00:22:02.27,00:22:02.27,"did at our other tribe. >> Oh, no, the women on our"
347,00:22:05.77,00:22:05.77,island had big boobs with tiny bikinis.
348,00:22:08.43,00:22:08.43,">> Over here, I think we got eight guys on the island."
349,00:22:12.17,00:22:12.17,We got eight guys and one girl. I think her name is John.
350,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,>> I don't know anything about that one.
351,00:22:21.93,00:22:21.93,">> Ah, here's one of my favorite girls right here."
352,00:22:25.27,00:22:25.27,"Hmm, Tammy? >> You just like me because I"
353,00:22:27.50,00:22:27.50,bring you food. >> That's right.
354,00:22:29.23,00:22:29.23,">> Take a handful, and I'll bring it over to the other guys."
355,00:22:32.27,00:22:32.27,>> Tammy knows the deal. >> Tammy knows what's up.
356,00:22:35.03,00:22:35.03,">> Thank you, Tammy. >> Thank you, babe."
357,00:22:37.23,00:22:37.23,">> You're welcome. >> Now see, see..."
358,00:22:40.73,00:22:40.73,>> We could've used her on the island.
359,00:22:43.13,00:22:43.13,">> She's all right. Long as she keeps serving,"
360,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,she'll do fine. >> Minute she stops...
361,00:22:48.80,00:22:48.80,>> See ya later. >> ...she's out.
362,00:22:51.77,00:22:51.77,">> If Sean and Rob decide not to work, we will still feed them,"
363,00:22:55.97,00:22:55.97,"but their asses will be gone, first vote."
364,00:23:00.17,00:23:00.17,">> Tomorrow, I think me and you should go on a hike and"
365,00:23:02.97,00:23:02.97,"basically, what we'll do is, we'll go around that corner over"
366,00:23:06.10,00:23:06.10,"there, and we'll chill out all day."
367,00:23:08.67,00:23:08.67,"What do you think? Cool? >> This morning, we got up."
368,00:23:26.10,00:23:26.10,We started a little fire. Decided we were going to go for
369,00:23:29.37,00:23:29.37,"a hike. Filled up some water bottles,"
370,00:23:31.43,00:23:31.43,and then took off around the trail.
371,00:23:33.43,00:23:33.43,"I look like I have the measles. >> You ready, pappy?"
372,00:23:35.93,00:23:35.93,">> I'm ready. >> All right, you want to carry"
373,00:23:38.13,00:23:38.13,"a water? >> Sarah, are you okay?"
374,00:23:54.90,00:23:54.90,">> Yeah, why? >> Sarah just strolls."
375,00:23:59.20,00:23:59.20,She's a stroller. >> Kathy decided she was going
376,00:24:03.10,00:24:03.10,"to take lead, and somewhere along the way we missed a trail"
377,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,"or something, but we got sidetracked and basically got"
378,00:24:09.60,00:24:09.60,"lost. >> Yeah, we're too high now."
379,00:24:11.63,00:24:11.63,We've got to traverse down. We're going to backtrack just to
380,00:24:15.30,00:24:15.30,"be safe, instead of sliding down."
381,00:24:17.30,00:24:17.30,>> All right. >> Everybody enjoyed it up to a
382,00:24:20.03,00:24:20.03,point. And then I think people started
383,00:24:22.33,00:24:22.33,getting tired of the long hike and wondering if we were getting
384,00:24:26.20,00:24:26.20,lost. They weren't used to
385,00:24:27.67,00:24:27.67,"bushwhacking. I was used to it, so I was"
386,00:24:29.97,00:24:29.97,feeling rather confident that we'll be okay.
387,00:24:32.50,00:24:32.50,We either go to the lagoon or we go back down and up and try to
388,00:24:36.17,00:24:36.17,find that trail. But why don't we move over a
389,00:24:38.77,00:24:38.77,little bit further? >> I'm game. Go ahead.
390,00:24:41.17,00:24:41.17,"Neleh and Paschal, I think, were very irritated."
391,00:24:43.97,00:24:43.97,Sometimes I see that Kathy gets on their nerves just because she
392,00:24:47.67,00:24:47.67,is so aggressive. And they're not aggressive
393,00:24:51.83,00:24:51.83,people; they're very passive. >> They're back there.
394,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,I'm not waiting. Sorry. >> They were irritated with her
395,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,"because she wanted to go on, and that might tend to break down"
396,00:25:00.90,00:25:00.90,after a while their bond that they have.
397,00:25:08.77,00:25:08.77,">> It was hard going, somewhat. But we finally found this very,"
398,00:25:12.20,00:25:12.20,"very deep rock pool. >> There is the biggest shrimp,"
399,00:25:15.07,00:25:15.07,"you guys. >> Look at that shrimp, you"
400,00:25:17.07,00:25:17.07,"guys, hurry, look. >> It's huge."
401,00:25:18.80,00:25:18.80,">> Oh, my God. I don't know if that is."
402,00:25:20.93,00:25:20.93,Is that a shrimp? >> Yeah.
403,00:25:22.33,00:25:22.33,>> It's a shrimp. >> Whoa!
404,00:25:23.77,00:25:23.77,>> There's five huge ones right there.
405,00:25:26.07,00:25:26.07,">> We found a bubbling brook, and there was a pool there with"
406,00:25:29.77,00:25:29.77,"pretty good-sized shrimp, maybe, you know, three-to-four-inch"
407,00:25:33.47,00:25:33.47,size shrimp. Neleh decided it would be nice
408,00:25:36.07,00:25:36.07,"to try and catch some shrimps. >> Oh, wow, there's a nice one."
409,00:25:40.87,00:25:40.87,>> Dang it! >> Sarah basically just sat on
410,00:25:45.67,00:25:45.67,"the shore the whole time scratching her legs, and really"
411,00:25:48.87,00:25:48.87,not doing much of anything to help with the food situation.
412,00:25:52.23,00:25:52.23,>> I'll see you guys in a little bit.
413,00:25:54.03,00:25:54.03,>> All right. Be careful. >> See you.
414,00:25:55.87,00:25:55.87,>> Sarah decided that she was getting eaten pretty bad by the
415,00:26:00.37,00:26:00.37,"no-nos, so she decided she wanted to leave and head on back"
416,00:26:04.67,00:26:04.67,"to camp. We truly didn't care, she wasn't"
417,00:26:07.43,00:26:07.43,"doing anything, anyway. >> I have lost an extreme amount"
418,00:26:10.33,00:26:10.33,"of weight, and I'm getting very weak and the bug bites are"
419,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,driving me absolutely insane. I thought I was going to come
420,00:26:16.43,00:26:16.43,back to camp and cut my legs off with a machete.
421,00:26:19.13,00:26:19.13,">> Gina, can you hear me? >> Sarah's lost."
422,00:26:21.87,00:26:21.87,>> How far up here is the trail? Do you remember?
423,00:26:25.07,00:26:25.07,>> I don't even know where you're at.
424,00:26:27.47,00:26:27.47,"Sarah basically just couldn't find her way back, so she came"
425,00:26:31.43,00:26:31.43,"back. >> Apparently, I'm not going"
426,00:26:33.63,00:26:33.63,anywhere. >> Sarah likes to sit back.
427,00:26:36.03,00:26:36.03,I think that's probably her thing-- she doesn't participate.
428,00:26:40.00,00:26:40.00,"But Neleh, and Paschal and obviously Gina and myself are"
429,00:26:43.67,00:26:43.67,willing to explore and get some food other than just plucking it
430,00:26:47.90,00:26:47.90,off a tree. >> Yes!
431,00:26:49.63,00:26:49.63,>> Got another one? >> Two.
432,00:26:51.30,00:26:51.30,>> She got two nice ones. (squeals)
433,00:27:15.07,00:27:15.07,">> Guys, how is it? >> Great, thank you."
434,00:27:17.53,00:27:17.53,>> Want a little bit more? >> Yeah.
435,00:27:19.33,00:27:19.33,Thank you so much. >> You're welcome.
436,00:27:22.33,00:27:22.33,">> Thank you, Tammy. >> I'm telling you, as your"
437,00:27:33.00,00:27:33.00,"friend, man, they're already five strong."
438,00:27:35.33,00:27:35.33,"And their group... their group is real tight, I mean..."
439,00:27:38.50,00:27:38.50,What we can do is win the next challenges and ensure that we
440,00:27:41.97,00:27:41.97,"stay here, but me you and V are going to get picked off one by"
441,00:27:45.57,00:27:45.57,"one, anyway. >> Whoo!"
442,00:27:46.63,00:27:46.63,>> These five have been here before us.
443,00:27:48.73,00:27:48.73,"They're a strong knit group, we're going to be the first to"
444,00:27:51.93,00:27:51.93,go if they have to vote anyway. So there's nothing you can do to
445,00:27:55.40,00:27:55.40,"try to prove yourself. And if you don't kiss butt, like"
446,00:27:59.03,00:27:59.03,"I don't plan to do, then you just know that your butt is"
447,00:28:01.67,00:28:01.67,"next. If I'm the next one voted off,"
448,00:28:03.30,00:28:03.30,"so be it. But I tell you, I can't hold my"
449,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,mouth for too long. They are definitely going to
450,00:28:07.37,00:28:07.37,know where Sean is coming from. We're not going to overexert
451,00:28:10.13,00:28:10.13,ourselves knowing we're coming into a situation where we may
452,00:28:12.87,00:28:12.87,get voted off anyway. We're not trying to prove
453,00:28:15.00,00:28:15.00,"nothing. We're trying to fit in, have fun"
454,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,while we do it. And whatever game y'all five got
455,00:28:19.07,00:28:19.07,"going... >> Listen, listen, I want you"
456,00:28:20.80,00:28:20.80,"to, I want you to... I mean, you're going to think what"
457,00:28:23.33,00:28:23.33,"you're going to think. >> I hear you, but the thing is,"
458,00:28:25.83,00:28:25.83,we're not going to run around here like slaves to prove
459,00:28:28.37,00:28:28.37,anything to anybody. That's why we're going to rest
460,00:28:30.70,00:28:30.70,when we want to rest. Y'all are Clydesdales.
461,00:28:32.70,00:28:32.70,Every last one of you all are getting up every five seconds...
462,00:28:35.53,00:28:35.53,"(panting): ""Yeah, I'm going to go 50-mile hiking."
463,00:28:39.13,00:28:39.13,"Okay, let's cut up some coconut and let's cut this up."""
464,00:28:41.77,00:28:41.77,Let's sit our butts down and freaking relax!
465,00:28:43.90,00:28:43.90,"Man, I'm getting tired of this working around."
466,00:28:46.10,00:28:46.10,I'm a grown man out here. I'm going to be real with you.
467,00:28:48.80,00:28:48.80,>> I want you to be real... >> I didn't come out here for
468,00:28:51.00,00:28:51.00,all of this. I'm getting tired of this bull.
469,00:28:52.73,00:28:52.73,"We're not tip toeing around a mother out here, and I'm coming"
470,00:28:55.10,00:28:55.10,"out my shell, telling you right now."
471,00:28:56.50,00:28:56.50,"The bottom line, if y'all are going to vote us off, vote us"
472,00:28:58.83,00:28:58.83,off. >> What do you think about all
473,00:29:12.50,00:29:12.50,"this, V.? >> It's too much damn drama for"
474,00:29:15.40,00:29:15.40,"me. You know, I'm down with you"
475,00:29:17.57,00:29:17.57,guys. I'm going to be with you
476,00:29:19.70,00:29:19.70,"regardless, you know that. But as far as the chitchat and"
477,00:29:23.77,00:29:23.77,"the drama, bump that. I ain't with it."
478,00:29:26.57,00:29:26.57,"Stay drama-free, and that's the way to be."
479,00:29:31.13,00:29:31.13,"You know, when the drama starts, I walk away."
480,00:29:33.97,00:29:33.97,"If my name's not in it, then I'm not in it."
481,00:29:43.37,00:29:43.37,">> So, this challenge thing. Oh, God."
482,00:29:47.87,00:29:47.87,"It's gonna be interesting. Oh, I just love tree mail."
483,00:29:55.50,00:29:55.50,"""Look for the pattern or you may be leaving."
484,00:29:58.57,00:29:58.57,The key to victory is all in the weaving.
485,00:30:01.47,00:30:01.47,You need to be wary of the time you're using.
486,00:30:04.43,00:30:04.43,"If you take too long, eviction is looming."""
487,00:30:07.27,00:30:07.27,"Oh, God, thank God my weaving skills are good."
488,00:30:10.30,00:30:10.30,"How about you? >> I know, good."
489,00:30:14.40,00:30:14.40,>> Oh... >> Sarah...
490,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,>> Sarah. >> We got tree mail.
491,00:30:19.90,00:30:19.90,>> What's it say? >> You want to come up here?
492,00:30:22.80,00:30:22.80,>> I think Rotu is going to do something.
493,00:30:25.40,00:30:25.40,I think they'll back off. If they don't like the people
494,00:30:28.90,00:30:28.90,"that came over, I can see that tribe backing off on a"
495,00:30:32.27,00:30:32.27,"challenge. Just taking it slower, maybe"
496,00:30:34.73,00:30:34.73,"allowing us to win, just so they have the opportunity to vote"
497,00:30:38.63,00:30:38.63,"somebody off. >> One, two, three, Maraamu!"
498,00:30:41.63,00:30:41.63,>> That just sounds weird. >> It does sound weird.
499,00:31:00.60,00:31:00.60,>> PROBST: Okay. First things first.
500,00:31:03.23,00:31:03.23,"Give it up, Gabe. New tribes, maybe new energy"
501,00:31:10.40,00:31:10.40,"around the immunity idol, or maybe it goes back home with"
502,00:31:14.43,00:31:14.43,"Rotu once again. Okay, today's immunity challenge"
503,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,is all about the weaving. Each of you have a woven
504,00:31:21.67,00:31:21.67,"tapestry that is scrambled, it's very simple."
505,00:31:24.70,00:31:24.70,"The first tribe to unscramble it correctly wins immunity,"
506,00:31:27.80,00:31:27.80,"guarantees themselves three more days on the island, and you're"
507,00:31:31.23,00:31:31.23,one step closer to a million bucks.
508,00:31:33.17,00:31:33.17,"Losing tribe, Tribal Council tonight with me."
509,00:31:36.07,00:31:36.07,"For somebody, life on the island will be over."
510,00:31:39.00,00:31:39.00,"Big enough stakes, I'm sure. Rotu, you need to sit out three"
511,00:31:42.87,00:31:42.87,"members. Sean, John, Rob."
512,00:31:45.50,00:31:45.50,"All right, you guys are sitting out."
513,00:31:47.57,00:31:47.57,"Take your spots, and we'll go. Survivors ready!"
514,00:31:53.57,00:31:53.57,"Go! >> It's oriented, it's"
515,00:31:56.27,00:31:56.27,oriented... Pull back around the bottom.
516,00:31:58.00,00:31:58.00,Pull back around the bottom. Pull your way.
517,00:31:59.97,00:31:59.97,"Go the other way, the other direction."
518,00:32:02.30,00:32:02.30,"That's it. That's the bottom piece, three"
519,00:32:04.40,00:32:04.40,"dashes, three dashes on the bottom."
520,00:32:06.20,00:32:06.20,">> Three dashes... >> Keep going, keep going, this"
521,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,"way, this is it. >> Good."
522,00:32:11.27,00:32:11.27,>> Okay? >> We got to do this one.
523,00:32:13.07,00:32:13.07,">> Which way, that way? >> Let's start with the eyeball."
524,00:32:16.07,00:32:16.07,>> We need to kind of figure out the design.
525,00:32:18.40,00:32:18.40,">> Okay, so pull and push on that eyeball."
526,00:32:20.63,00:32:20.63,">> Here's the eyeball, right here."
527,00:32:22.43,00:32:22.43,>> Okay. >> Look.
528,00:32:23.33,00:32:23.33,">> Yeah, but I think we should be working on this quadrant."
529,00:32:25.43,00:32:25.43,">> That matched, babe. >> No, it didn't."
530,00:32:26.87,00:32:26.87,">> Yeah, it did. The eyeballs were perfect."
531,00:32:28.40,00:32:28.40,">> Pull, pull, pull! >> Okay, now line up this one."
532,00:32:30.93,00:32:30.93,">> Go that way, go that way first and see what we got."
533,00:32:33.07,00:32:33.07,">> It's going to line up the other side, right there."
534,00:32:35.20,00:32:35.20,">> Yep, yep, yep! >> Let's get this one."
535,00:32:36.77,00:32:36.77,">> Need the black line, so there."
536,00:32:39.17,00:32:39.17,"Okay, there. Now that one on the end."
537,00:32:40.90,00:32:40.90,">> Yeah, we're looking for three lines."
538,00:32:42.73,00:32:42.73,">> Here they come. >> Easy, easy, easy, easy."
539,00:32:44.87,00:32:44.87,">> You got it, you got it. It's cool."
540,00:32:46.60,00:32:46.60,>> This is it right here. Lined up with the eye right
541,00:32:49.13,00:32:49.13,"here, okay. >> That's it. That's it."
542,00:32:52.60,00:32:52.60,>> Keep on moving down. >> You guys just have to keep
543,00:32:54.87,00:32:54.87,"working. I, you know... We're looking for the eyeballs."
544,00:32:57.63,00:32:57.63,">> The top is supposed to be striped, just like that."
545,00:33:00.27,00:33:00.27,">> Okay, so this is the top, we got eyeballs here."
546,00:33:02.67,00:33:02.67,See this little grid pattern? >> Here's the actual eyeball.
547,00:33:05.50,00:33:05.50,Right. >> There's lots of eyeballs.
548,00:33:07.17,00:33:07.17,">> Yep. Okay, work with that eyeball right there."
549,00:33:09.53,00:33:09.53,Those aren't lining up. >> This one is the top of the
550,00:33:12.07,00:33:12.07,eyeball right here. This one doesn't fit.
551,00:33:14.03,00:33:14.03,>> The eyeball should be at the top.
552,00:33:16.10,00:33:16.10,>> Maybe it's the middle. >> I think it should go the
553,00:33:18.83,00:33:18.83,other way. >> Up and down we're good.
554,00:33:21.97,00:33:21.97,Tammy. >> We're looking for this block
555,00:33:23.83,00:33:23.83,"right here. >> All right, we'll line this"
556,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,"up-- keep going, keep going. I'll tell you. I'll tell you."
557,00:33:28.67,00:33:28.67,"There, that's the piece. That's it, all right, excellent."
558,00:33:31.47,00:33:31.47,>> We're going this way now. >> Horizontal.
559,00:33:33.57,00:33:33.57,"All right, line up the very top one, work on the very top"
560,00:33:36.33,00:33:36.33,one. Finish those eyes at the top.
561,00:33:38.00,00:33:38.00,"Okay, now do the next one down. >> Yeah, pull to you."
562,00:33:40.60,00:33:40.60,">> That's it, that's it. That's it."
563,00:33:42.30,00:33:42.30,>> I think it should go the other way.
564,00:33:44.20,00:33:44.20,>> Back the other way? >> Go back and see what it looks
565,00:33:46.93,00:33:46.93,"like. >> Yeah, there is stripes at the"
566,00:33:48.83,00:33:48.83,"bottom. >> You guys need to be working,"
567,00:33:50.77,00:33:50.77,too. I think we need to be both
568,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,"pulling and pushing, come on. I think this way is kind of"
569,00:33:55.17,00:33:55.17,"strange. Here, what about this one?"
570,00:33:56.90,00:33:56.90,">> Okay, that's good, we're matched over here."
571,00:33:59.20,00:33:59.20,">> But then this doesn't look... >> Okay, work with that eyeball"
572,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,right there. I think this is matched right
573,00:34:04.60,00:34:04.60,"here. >> That's the center piece, all"
574,00:34:06.87,00:34:06.87,"right, and now this one to fix. Give me slack."
575,00:34:09.43,00:34:09.43,>> Wait. >> Here it comes.
576,00:34:10.53,00:34:10.53,">> Here it comes. >> Okay, keep going, keep going."
577,00:34:12.73,00:34:12.73,"That side piece. >> Right there, where you are."
578,00:34:14.77,00:34:14.77,">> Back corner, right there. >> Yeah."
579,00:34:16.37,00:34:16.37,>> Try it through till you line that piece up again.
580,00:34:18.60,00:34:18.60,">> Pull. >> Here it comes, here it comes."
581,00:34:20.93,00:34:20.93,">> Keep pulling, pull. Slow, slow, slow. That's it."
582,00:34:23.87,00:34:23.87,>> That's it. >> That's it right there.
583,00:34:26.13,00:34:26.13,>> Rotu! >> PROBST: Rotu.
584,00:34:27.87,00:34:27.87,(cheering) >> All right!
585,00:34:33.80,00:34:33.80,">> PROBST: Rotu, nice job once again."
586,00:34:37.13,00:34:37.13,">> Yeah, baby! >> PROBST: She's never felt that"
587,00:34:39.00,00:34:39.00,before. (cheering)
588,00:34:41.97,00:34:41.97,"Maraamu, Tribal Council. For three of you, that'll be a"
589,00:34:44.57,00:34:44.57,"new experience. Not a pleasant one, I assure"
590,00:34:46.67,00:34:46.67,you. You guys can head straight back
591,00:34:48.37,00:34:48.37,out this way. (cheering)
592,00:35:12.17,00:35:12.17,>> Oh! >> Touche!
593,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,">> You know, Rotu just has this heat on their breath that"
594,00:35:20.30,00:35:20.30,"they... (growling) You know, they were just..."
595,00:35:23.37,00:35:23.37,"""We're going to get it."" And that's the way they do their"
596,00:35:27.20,00:35:27.20,challenges. Just with that fierce
597,00:35:29.10,00:35:29.10,determination. >> Definitely doesn't feel good
598,00:35:31.80,00:35:31.80,"to lose, that's for sure. As usual, Maraamu is heading"
599,00:35:34.97,00:35:34.97,back to Tribal Council tonight. This is our fourth time.
600,00:35:38.27,00:35:38.27,I'm kind of used to it. But I still hate it.
601,00:35:41.23,00:35:41.23,"I'm not looking forward to it, at all."
602,00:35:43.13,00:35:43.13,"And it's a little unnerving, because we are outnumbered."
603,00:35:50.93,00:35:50.93,"Sarah, I think, has kind of pretty much given up."
604,00:35:53.53,00:35:53.53,I think she probably knows that she's going to go.
605,00:35:56.23,00:35:56.23,"I don't know that, 'cause the type of person she is, she might"
606,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57,"not have a clue. >> I'm definitely not giving up,"
607,00:36:02.27,00:36:02.27,but it's so hard to say with the five people we have now who's
608,00:36:05.60,00:36:05.60,"going to go, because we're all getting along so good."
609,00:36:08.43,00:36:08.43,"The one vote that I probably will have will be for Kathy, and"
610,00:36:11.73,00:36:11.73,it's because she's been very overbearing and motherly to me.
611,00:36:15.33,00:36:15.33,"Even though that may just be her personality, I don't know how"
612,00:36:17.97,00:36:17.97,long I could stand that. >> Fire's done.
613,00:36:22.70,00:36:22.70,">> Warm... it's hot in here. >> Kathy, she's a hard-working"
614,00:36:25.63,00:36:25.63,"woman. She is very energetic, very"
615,00:36:27.33,00:36:27.33,"outgoing, I mean, she's out here for the kill."
616,00:36:29.63,00:36:29.63,"You know, she just wants to get things done."
617,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,"In the beginning of our challenge, she was kind of"
618,00:36:34.33,00:36:34.33,barking out orders and she's kind of really uptight about
619,00:36:37.20,00:36:37.20,everything. She wants it done here and now.
620,00:36:39.37,00:36:39.37,"Go get the fire started, and she kind of like, almost panics."
621,00:36:42.43,00:36:42.43,"You know, so it kind of puts the rest of us into this panic"
622,00:36:45.40,00:36:45.40,"stage. >> That's fine, I just feel"
623,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33,better now. (chuckles) >> No problem.
624,00:36:49.47,00:36:49.47,">> And who knows? I mean, I was walking today saying, ""Kath, you"
625,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"just never know, you know? You might get voted off."""
626,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,">> PROBST: Neleh and Paschal and Kathy, because this is your"
627,00:37:34.60,00:37:34.60,"first Tribal Council, we have a little ritual."
628,00:37:36.73,00:37:36.73,Behind each of you is a personalized tribal torch.
629,00:37:39.07,00:37:39.07,"Why don't you go ahead and grab it, approach the flame and light"
630,00:37:42.40,00:37:42.40,it up. The reason for the ritual?
631,00:37:48.23,00:37:48.23,"At Tribal Council, fire represents your life in this"
632,00:37:51.30,00:37:51.30,game. So you'll take these torches
633,00:37:53.30,00:37:53.30,back with you to camp and you'll bring them to all future Tribal
634,00:37:57.07,00:37:57.07,"Councils. As long as you have fire,"
635,00:37:59.33,00:37:59.33,"you remain on the island. When your fire is gone, so are"
636,00:38:02.73,00:38:02.73,you. As will be the case tonight for
637,00:38:05.07,00:38:05.07,one of the five of you. A lot has changed in the last
638,00:38:08.57,00:38:08.57,"couple days. Paschal, what was your reaction"
639,00:38:11.43,00:38:11.43,"to the switch? >> Well, initially I was kind of"
640,00:38:14.10,00:38:14.10,"shocked, because I wasn't prepared for it."
641,00:38:16.30,00:38:16.30,After we got back it was like being thrown in a briar patch.
642,00:38:19.50,00:38:19.50,They like taking care of an old man pretty well.
643,00:38:22.03,00:38:22.03,>> PROBST: So it worked out all right for you?
644,00:38:24.43,00:38:24.43,">> Worked out great. >> PROBST: Gina, how about you?"
645,00:38:27.00,00:38:27.00,"Nothing changed in terms of tribe name, but certainly tribe"
646,00:38:29.77,00:38:29.77,"members. >> It was awesome, it was"
647,00:38:31.33,00:38:31.33,"probably one of the better days that I've had out here, to be"
648,00:38:34.20,00:38:34.20,honest with you. >> PROBST: Do you think you were
649,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,in danger of being voted out if the tribe Maraamu had remained
650,00:38:39.43,00:38:39.43,the same? >> I would have been the next to
651,00:38:41.57,00:38:41.57,"go if the tribe had stayed the same, definitely."
652,00:38:44.10,00:38:44.10,>> PROBST: So you're not missing the old tribe members?
653,00:38:47.00,00:38:47.00,">> Not really. >> PROBST: Kathy, what was your"
654,00:38:49.40,00:38:49.40,reaction as people were pulling one buff out and putting a new
655,00:38:52.70,00:38:52.70,"one on? >> I was not happy, you know, I"
656,00:38:54.73,00:38:54.73,"was disappointed. I mean, Rotu's a strong team."
657,00:38:57.20,00:38:57.20,"I'm a competitor, I-I just couldn't believe it."
658,00:38:59.67,00:38:59.67,"I mean, the range of emotions were just vast."
659,00:39:02.10,00:39:02.10,"Angry, sad. Oh, my God, what's going to"
660,00:39:04.10,00:39:04.10,happen next? I had no idea.
661,00:39:05.50,00:39:05.50,"So it was just, you know, pulling the rug right out from"
662,00:39:08.47,00:39:08.47,under me. >> PROBST: Do you feel like
663,00:39:10.53,00:39:10.53,you're with the losers now? >> I don't feel like it's the
664,00:39:13.80,00:39:13.80,losers. I just think it's a new era
665,00:39:15.77,00:39:15.77,almost. So right now we're just enjoying
666,00:39:18.03,00:39:18.03,ourselves and trying to regain some new spirit for the next
667,00:39:21.40,00:39:21.40,challenges. >> PROBST: Neleh?
668,00:39:22.80,00:39:22.80,"What was your reaction? >> I had a tough time at first,"
669,00:39:25.57,00:39:25.57,"especially, I mean, when I flipped over my log, you know, I"
670,00:39:28.50,00:39:28.50,saw two of our really strong tribe members go onto the green
671,00:39:31.50,00:39:31.50,mat and I knew I to walk to yellow.
672,00:39:33.23,00:39:33.23,I was just really bummed out. I just sat there waiting
673,00:39:35.93,00:39:35.93,"patiently, hoping that some more of the, you know, the people"
674,00:39:39.00,00:39:39.00,would come over. I just didn't know what to
675,00:39:41.13,00:39:41.13,"expect, so I was very, very, disappointed at first."
676,00:39:43.70,00:39:43.70,">> PROBST: Has that changed? >> Yeah, I mean, once I got"
677,00:39:46.67,00:39:46.67,"there, it's beautiful. The white sand beach is amazing"
678,00:39:49.53,00:39:49.53,"there. I got to meet some new people,"
679,00:39:51.50,00:39:51.50,which was really nice. So every day things are getting
680,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37,"better and better. >> PROBST: How about for you,"
681,00:39:56.87,00:39:56.87,Sarah-- reaction? >> It was definitely a shocker.
682,00:39:59.47,00:39:59.47,"It was a good thing, though. I was glad to get to know some"
683,00:40:02.60,00:40:02.60,"new people, new faces, new energy."
684,00:40:04.60,00:40:04.60,"It's been a good thing, though. >> PROBST: Okay, it's time to"
685,00:40:07.53,00:40:07.53,"vote. Kathy, you're first."
686,00:41:07.67,00:41:07.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
687,00:41:23.03,00:41:23.03,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
688,00:41:25.60,00:41:25.60,The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
689,00:41:27.93,00:41:27.93,immediately. I'll read the votes.
690,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,"First vote, Sarah. Kathy."
691,00:41:47.00,00:41:47.00,Sarah. Sarah.
692,00:41:53.53,00:41:53.53,"That's a majority vote, no need to read the last vote."
693,00:41:55.90,00:41:55.90,"Sarah, you need to bring me your torch."
694,00:42:08.60,00:42:08.60,"Sarah, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
695,00:42:17.97,00:42:17.97,>> Thanks. >> This game is unpredictable.
696,00:42:26.70,00:42:26.70,To stay in it you have to adapt. I give you guys credit for doing
697,00:42:29.83,00:42:29.83,"that. You may be a new tribe, but you"
698,00:42:32.23,00:42:32.23,are a tribe. You guys can take your torches
699,00:42:35.07,00:42:35.07,and head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow.
700,00:42:50.43,00:42:50.43,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
701,00:42:56.73,00:42:56.73,">> PROBST: Next time on  Survivor, Maraamu finds a new"
702,00:42:59.07,00:42:59.07,spirit. >> It's the first time I felt as
703,00:43:00.90,00:43:00.90,though I had been on a real team.
704,00:43:02.37,00:43:02.37,">> PROBST: At Rotu, suspicion and doubt cause the love tribe"
705,00:43:05.03,00:43:05.03,to fracture. >> Are we staying tight?
706,00:43:06.67,00:43:06.67,Is that the deal? Are we trying to put Rotu back
707,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80,together? >> PROBST: And one tribe will
708,00:43:10.53,00:43:10.53,have a chance to devastate the competition.
709,00:43:12.43,00:43:12.43,The winning tribe gets to raid the losing tribe's camp.
710,00:43:14.90,00:43:14.90,>> Wow. >> I'm getting kind of emotional
711,00:43:22.53,00:43:22.53,"right now, which I didn't think I would do."
712,00:43:24.33,00:43:24.33,But I'm excited for the people that get to go back and finish
713,00:43:28.30,00:43:28.30,the game and do what they have been doing very well.
714,00:43:31.70,00:43:31.70,"And I hope that my original seven other teammates, Rob and"
715,00:43:35.47,00:43:35.47,"Sean and V and Gina, especially, do very, very, well, and I hope"
716,00:43:39.63,00:43:39.63,they're having a great time.  Captioning sponsored by CBS
