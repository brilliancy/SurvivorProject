436,00:29:38.38,00:29:38.38,But who knows?>> There's nothing happening.

446,00:30:36.83,00:30:36.83,really try to get Candice off.She's worried that I wouldn't
447,00:30:39.62,00:30:39.62,"vote Candice out, which is true.So Jenny might be the next one"
448,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,to go.>> He's a cool guy.
449,00:31:00.25,00:31:00.25,But I wouldn't turn on any oneof our original members for him.
450,00:31:06.33,00:31:06.33,That's not fair.We've gone through too much
451,00:31:09.92,00:31:09.92,"together, you know.Even though there are times"
452,00:31:13.71,00:31:13.71,where I wonder about certainindividuals.
453,00:31:17.04,00:31:17.04,The tribe's consensus is to votefor Rebecca.
454,00:31:20.29,00:31:20.29,She's our weakest link.But I would say maybe Jonathan
455,00:31:23.71,00:31:23.71,"right now, just because of thefact that he's not family."
456,00:31:27.46,00:31:27.46,"You know, we want to keep itRarotonga as much as we can."
457,00:31:30.21,00:31:30.21,It's kind of a... it's a weirdvote tonight.
458,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,>> We've got three good-lookingfish here.
459,00:31:36.46,00:31:36.46,">> Yeah, man.>> Beautiful."
460,00:31:38.54,00:31:38.54,">> Yeah, baby.I believe they're going to vote"

462,00:31:42.42,00:31:42.42,I hope.And through a frickin' lot of
463,00:31:44.50,00:31:44.50,"hard work on my part the lastcouple of days, I think I have"
464,00:31:47.62,00:31:47.62,earned at least the right to onemore night.

468,00:32:01.29,00:32:01.29,>> But who knows?We don't know.
469,00:32:03.08,00:32:03.08,Who knows what it's goingto say.
470,00:32:05.12,00:32:05.12,>> It's going to be somethingbad.

476,00:32:54.04,00:32:54.04,"He's merely here to listen.Okay, as a tribe, you guys have"
477,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,"won three challenges.Jenny, what can you do to change"
478,00:33:06.46,00:33:06.46,something within this tribe?>> I wish I knew the answer.
479,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,I still can't pinpoint it.I think it goes back to
480,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,analyzing our strengths andweaknesses.
481,00:33:15.42,00:33:15.42,"I don't know.I mean, from now, I guess we"
482,00:33:17.79,00:33:17.79,"just have to wait and see.>> PROBST: Rebecca, let's talk"
483,00:33:20.58,00:33:20.58,about what's going on at camp.What goes on?
484,00:33:23.12,00:33:23.12,Fishing?>> We know we have to move
485,00:33:25.58,00:33:25.58,"forward and we have to stay aspositive as we possibly can, so"
486,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,"everybody goes out clamming,crabbing, octopusing..."

496,00:33:59.83,00:33:59.83,Jonathan is a big part of thistribe right now.
497,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,He's been basically nourishingus so that we could have the
498,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,"energy to perform today, youknow, and it's cool to have him"

502,00:34:16.38,00:34:16.38,You had two people come over wholeft their old tribe.
503,00:34:19.33,00:34:19.33,There could be questions oftrust there.
504,00:34:21.58,00:34:21.58,But it's fair to say at thispoint that Candice and Jonathan
505,00:34:24.17,00:34:24.17,"both are now very strong membersof this tribe, and are helping"
