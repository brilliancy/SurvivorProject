76,00:04:25.12,00:04:25.12,"So I'm a little worried about that, because we don't want Adam"

261,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,came out of a fierce battle. It was incredible.

276,00:18:05.21,00:18:05.21,the first time since I've been here where I really felt really
277,00:18:07.50,00:18:07.50,carefree and just enjoyed myself.
278,00:18:43.79,00:18:43.79,">> Yul's a very complex, very, very intellectual guy."
279,00:18:48.25,00:18:48.25,To see him come out of his shell was amazing.

282,00:19:13.75,00:19:13.75,separated into all of our same ethnicities.
283,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,Now we're all able to come together and experience a
284,00:19:19.62,00:19:19.62,totally new culture. And we carry a piece of their
285,00:19:22.83,00:19:22.83,spirit with us into the next challenge.
286,00:19:26.00,00:19:26.00,Raro doesn't know what's coming. >> My tribemates all want to

289,00:19:57.04,00:19:57.04,from losing. But the reason we've been losing
290,00:20:00.46,00:20:00.46,is these have not been a tribe yet.
291,00:20:04.21,00:20:04.21,They do not work together. And I realized if it was ever
292,00:20:07.04,00:20:07.04,"going to work, slowly but surely give them an example of another"
293,00:20:11.50,00:20:11.50,way to be in the tribe. And that is you work your ass
294,00:20:16.46,00:20:16.46,off all the time. >> Got some fish?
295,00:20:20.38,00:20:20.38,">> Dude, I got so many freaking fish."

299,00:20:30.00,00:20:30.00,I'm getting the hang of it now for sure.
300,00:20:32.12,00:20:32.12,These folks need to trust me. I need to help them out.

313,00:21:14.08,00:21:14.08,Does that make sense? >> There hasn't been one
314,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,challenge where I feel that Rebecca has been a strong force
315,00:21:23.00,00:21:23.00,to help our tribe win. >> I can help you.

382,00:25:59.79,00:25:59.79,">> PROBST: Becky slowing down. >> Come on, Becky!"
383,00:26:02.50,00:26:02.50,A little bit farther. >> PROBST: Jonathan back to
384,00:26:05.25,00:26:05.25,shore with the second bundle of island names for Raro.
385,00:26:09.67,00:26:09.67,>> Go! >> PROBST: Parvati heading out
386,00:26:11.83,00:26:11.83,"now for Raro. Parvati a strong swimmer, trying"
387,00:26:14.33,00:26:14.33,"to make up time now. >> Swim, baby, swim!"
388,00:26:19.79,00:26:19.79,>> PROBST: Becky is up with the third bundle of island names for
389,00:26:23.21,00:26:23.21,Aitu. Parvati has the third bundle for
390,00:26:29.79,00:26:29.79,Raro. Raro is catching up.
391,00:26:33.08,00:26:33.08,">> Come on, Becky! >> Push, Becky, push!"
392,00:26:37.08,00:26:37.08,>> PROBST: Sundra heads out for the fourth and final pontoon.
393,00:26:41.79,00:26:41.79,Parvati worn out. >> Run!
394,00:26:45.00,00:26:45.00,"That's it, that's it! Nice job!"
395,00:26:47.12,00:26:47.12,"Nice job. Go, Rebecca!"
396,00:26:49.21,00:26:49.21,>> PROBST: Rebecca heading out. Sundra can't get it on the first
397,00:26:55.08,00:26:55.08,"time down. >> Go, Rebecca!"
398,00:26:59.42,00:26:59.42,>> PROBST: Rebecca has reached the fourth pontoon for Raro.
399,00:27:06.08,00:27:06.08,Sundra has the fourth bundle of island names for Aitu.
400,00:27:09.46,00:27:09.46,">> Come on, Sundra! You've got it."
401,00:27:12.92,00:27:12.92,>> PROBST: Rebecca does not come up with the bundle.
402,00:27:15.12,00:27:15.12,">> Come on, Rebecca! >> Good job!"
403,00:27:17.50,00:27:17.50,"Come on, baby! >> Come on!"
404,00:27:19.96,00:27:19.96,">> PROBST: Aitu, start solving it."
405,00:27:29.67,00:27:29.67,>> PROBST: Rebecca has the fourth bag for Raro.
406,00:27:32.21,00:27:32.21,">> Come on, baby! >> PROBST: Aitu already at work"
407,00:27:35.96,00:27:35.96,"solving the puzzle. >> No, no."
408,00:27:38.50,00:27:38.50,Guam is up here. >> No.
409,00:27:40.75,00:27:40.75,>> Stand up! Stand up!
410,00:27:43.08,00:27:43.08,>> PROBST: Rebecca getting close to the shore.
411,00:27:46.08,00:27:46.08,">> That's it, baby! Run, now run!"
412,00:27:48.17,00:27:48.17,>> PROBST: Aitu very close. >> Okay.
413,00:27:50.08,00:27:50.08,"Ready, and untie! >> PROBST: Raro now working on"
414,00:27:52.96,00:27:52.96,the puzzle. Aitu thinks they have it.
415,00:27:57.04,00:27:57.04,"Stop working, Raro. Stop."
416,00:28:04.75,00:28:04.75,"Aitu wins immunity! >> Good job, guys."
417,00:28:15.12,00:28:15.12,"Good job. >> PROBST: Aitu, congratulations"
418,00:28:20.54,00:28:20.54,on your fourth straight win. Safe from tribal council once
419,00:28:24.12,00:28:24.12,"again. Raro, we have a date at tribal"
420,00:28:28.83,00:28:28.83,council. And you have a bottle.
421,00:28:32.04,00:28:32.04,The bottle is sealed. You will take it back with you
422,00:28:34.21,00:28:34.21,to camp. Bring it to tribal council.
423,00:28:36.38,00:28:36.38,You will open this bottle after the vote.
424,00:28:40.62,00:28:40.62,"Candice, grab your stuff. Head on back to camp."
425,00:28:55.38,00:28:55.38,>> What's in that little bottle that Jeff gave us?
426,00:28:57.50,00:28:57.50,">> I think individual challenges but no merge, or something weird"
427,00:29:00.08,00:29:00.08,"like that. Or, like, we have to live on the"
428,00:29:03.17,00:29:03.17,"same beach, but no merge. Once we lost immunity, there was"
429,00:29:12.33,00:29:12.33,a little twist that whoever had to go to tribal tonight was
430,00:29:16.17,00:29:16.17,"going to get this bottle with a message in it, and we couldn't"
431,00:29:18.88,00:29:18.88,open it until after the vote. >> I'm interested to hear what's
432,00:29:23.46,00:29:23.46,"in that bottle. >> I bet it says we have to,"
433,00:29:27.25,00:29:27.25,"tomorrow morning, get up and go to the other tribe's island for"
434,00:29:30.04,00:29:30.04,"breakfast and merge. >> I have this feeling of, like,"
435,00:29:33.92,00:29:33.92,"dread, like I don't want to open it, I don't want to know,"
436,00:29:36.25,00:29:36.25,because it's going to be something really bad.
437,00:29:38.38,00:29:38.38,But who knows? >> There's nothing happening.
438,00:29:58.67,00:29:58.67,">> Based on overall performance, productivity around camp, and"
439,00:30:03.92,00:30:03.92,"performance during challenges, we're going to have to break up"
440,00:30:07.96,00:30:07.96,our five-team alliance and send Rebecca home today.
441,00:30:12.33,00:30:12.33,>> I think it's good that Rebecca goes today.
442,00:30:16.08,00:30:16.08,">> Yeah, I think that's good, too."
443,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,">> Then after that, I don't know."
444,00:30:28.46,00:30:28.46,>> Do you think that will... she can get that to happen?
445,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,">> Jenny becomes a threat, and we really have to worry about"
446,00:30:33.25,00:30:33.25,"Jenny after this vote. At that point, she's going to"
447,00:30:36.83,00:30:36.83,really try to get Candice off. She's worried that I wouldn't
448,00:30:39.62,00:30:39.62,"vote Candice out, which is true. So Jenny might be the next one"
449,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,to go. >> He's a cool guy.
450,00:31:00.25,00:31:00.25,But I wouldn't turn on any one of our original members for him.
451,00:31:06.33,00:31:06.33,That's not fair. We've gone through too much
452,00:31:09.92,00:31:09.92,"together, you know. Even though there are times"
453,00:31:13.71,00:31:13.71,where I wonder about certain individuals.
454,00:31:17.04,00:31:17.04,The tribe's consensus is to vote for Rebecca.
455,00:31:20.29,00:31:20.29,She's our weakest link. But I would say maybe Jonathan
456,00:31:23.71,00:31:23.71,"right now, just because of the fact that he's not family."
457,00:31:27.46,00:31:27.46,"You know, we want to keep it Rarotonga as much as we can."
458,00:31:30.21,00:31:30.21,It's kind of a... it's a weird vote tonight.
459,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,>> We've got three good-looking fish here.
460,00:31:36.46,00:31:36.46,">> Yeah, man. >> Beautiful."
461,00:31:38.54,00:31:38.54,">> Yeah, baby. I believe they're going to vote"
462,00:31:40.58,00:31:40.58,Rebecca out. I believe.
463,00:31:42.42,00:31:42.42,I hope. And through a frickin' lot of
464,00:31:44.50,00:31:44.50,"hard work on my part the last couple of days, I think I have"
465,00:31:47.62,00:31:47.62,earned at least the right to one more night.
466,00:31:52.04,00:31:52.04,>> I'm really curious about that note.
467,00:31:54.38,00:31:54.38,>> Is it after the vote? Is it after the... after the
468,00:31:57.83,00:31:57.83,results are read? >> After the vote.
469,00:32:01.29,00:32:01.29,>> But who knows? We don't know.
470,00:32:03.08,00:32:03.08,Who knows what it's going to say.
471,00:32:05.12,00:32:05.12,>> It's going to be something bad.
472,00:32:07.12,00:32:07.12,"If it was something good, wouldn't they give it to the"
473,00:32:09.00,00:32:09.00,winning tribe? >> PROBST: we'll now bring in
474,00:32:35.50,00:32:35.50,"our jury. Brad, voted out at the last"
475,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,tribal council. Brad is here to observe.
476,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,You're not to direct anything to him.
477,00:32:54.04,00:32:54.04,"He's merely here to listen. Okay, as a tribe, you guys have"
478,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,"won three challenges. Jenny, what can you do to change"
479,00:33:06.46,00:33:06.46,something within this tribe? >> I wish I knew the answer.
480,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,I still can't pinpoint it. I think it goes back to
481,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,analyzing our strengths and weaknesses.
482,00:33:15.42,00:33:15.42,"I don't know. I mean, from now, I guess we"
483,00:33:17.79,00:33:17.79,"just have to wait and see. >> PROBST: Rebecca, let's talk"
484,00:33:20.58,00:33:20.58,about what's going on at camp. What goes on?
485,00:33:23.12,00:33:23.12,Fishing? >> We know we have to move
486,00:33:25.58,00:33:25.58,"forward and we have to stay as positive as we possibly can, so"
487,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,"everybody goes out clamming, crabbing, octopusing..."
488,00:33:32.08,00:33:32.08,>> And also I got some fish and some trochus.
489,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,">> PROBST: How many fish? >> Today and yesterday, I went"
490,00:33:39.17,00:33:39.17,"crazy with the spear and caught, like, 20, 22 fish in last two"
491,00:33:43.29,00:33:43.29,days. >> PROBST: 22 fish in the last
492,00:33:47.04,00:33:47.04,two days? >> Yeah.
493,00:33:49.50,00:33:49.50,">> PROBST: Parvati, now that Jonathan is here, in the last"
494,00:33:53.08,00:33:53.08,"two days, he's got 22 fish. Is it starting to feel like,"
495,00:33:55.75,00:33:55.75,"""Okay, Jonathan's growing on me."""
496,00:33:57.92,00:33:57.92,">> He's blending in. Yeah, definitely."
497,00:33:59.83,00:33:59.83,Jonathan is a big part of this tribe right now.
498,00:34:02.12,00:34:02.12,He's been basically nourishing us so that we could have the
499,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,"energy to perform today, you know, and it's cool to have him"
500,00:34:06.83,00:34:06.83,"around. >> PROBST: Adam, it's important"
501,00:34:09.54,00:34:09.54,"that you keep people around who can keep your tribe strong, and"
502,00:34:13.21,00:34:13.21,"people that you trust, which could present a dilemma."
503,00:34:16.38,00:34:16.38,You had two people come over who left their old tribe.
504,00:34:19.33,00:34:19.33,There could be questions of trust there.
505,00:34:21.58,00:34:21.58,But it's fair to say at this point that Candice and Jonathan
506,00:34:24.17,00:34:24.17,"both are now very strong members of this tribe, and are helping"
507,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,"keep you strong. >> Jeff, I'm tired of losing,"
508,00:34:30.42,00:34:30.42,and it's all about productivity for me.
509,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,"It's been other reasons before, and tonight it's about"
510,00:34:35.79,00:34:35.79,productivity. I don't like losing.
511,00:34:37.83,00:34:37.83,I'm tired of it. >> PROBST: Can't get much more
512,00:34:40.04,00:34:40.04,"clear than that. Okay, before we get to the vote,"
513,00:34:45.21,00:34:45.21,did somebody bring the bottle? So you've kept it sealed?
514,00:34:50.25,00:34:50.25,">> Difficult, but we kept it sealed."
515,00:34:52.38,00:34:52.38,>> PROBST: We will hold on to that bottle until after we have
516,00:34:54.79,00:34:54.79,"voted. Once the vote is over, you will"
517,00:34:56.88,00:34:56.88,open the bottle and read the note inside.
518,00:34:59.33,00:34:59.33,"Okay, it is time to vote. Candice, you're up."
519,00:35:14.21,00:35:14.21,">> You did you great today, but this is based on overall"
520,00:35:17.46,00:35:17.46,"productivity. >> Jonathan, I think you're a"
521,00:35:36.42,00:35:36.42,great guy. You just came into the game too
522,00:35:38.21,00:35:38.21,late. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
523,00:35:57.38,00:35:57.38,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
524,00:36:09.75,00:36:09.75,decision is final. The person voted out will be
525,00:36:11.79,00:36:11.79,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
526,00:36:14.88,00:36:14.88,I'll read the votes. First vote: Jonathan.
527,00:36:20.96,00:36:20.96,"Rebecca. One vote Jonathan, one vote"
528,00:36:24.88,00:36:24.88,Rebecca. Rebecca.
529,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,"Two votes Rebecca, one vote Jonathan."
530,00:36:33.67,00:36:33.67,"Rebecca. Three votes Rebecca, one vote"
531,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,"Jonathan. Tenth person voted out, the"
532,00:36:45.58,00:36:45.58,"second member of our jury, Rebecca."
533,00:36:48.67,00:36:48.67,"That's four, that's enough. Unless you have the hidden"
534,00:36:50.58,00:36:50.58,"immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch."
535,00:36:58.79,00:36:58.79,"Rebecca, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
536,00:37:18.83,00:37:18.83,"Okay, now it's time to get to the bottle."
537,00:37:22.21,00:37:22.21,"Parvati, before you open it, was there a consensus as to what the"
538,00:37:26.92,00:37:26.92,note inside might say? >> The consensus is it's a
539,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,"merge. Am I right, guys?"
540,00:37:31.71,00:37:31.71,But we don't know. We're hoping you're going to
541,00:37:33.79,00:37:33.79,roll out a whole buffet for us with coffee.
542,00:37:36.46,00:37:36.46,>> Ice cream. >> Champagne.
543,00:37:38.71,00:37:38.71,>> PROBST: Let's find out. Parvati?
544,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,I want you to open the note and read it out loud.
545,00:37:54.04,00:37:54.04,"""You've just voted out one member of your tribe."
546,00:37:58.88,00:37:58.88,"You will now vote out another."" That's not fun."
547,00:38:08.54,00:38:08.54,>> PROBST: Definitely not a merge.
548,00:38:10.46,00:38:10.46,">> Not a merge, and not very cool."
549,00:38:12.96,00:38:12.96,">> PROBST: So Nate, not only are you not merging tonight, you're"
550,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,voting out another tribe member right now.
551,00:38:19.62,00:38:19.62,">> This is wack Arnold, man. And now I'm thinking, if we had"
552,00:38:23.62,00:38:23.62,"this win today, they would have been down to two."
553,00:38:27.42,00:38:27.42,"Could have, should have, would have-- spilled milk."
554,00:38:30.38,00:38:30.38,>> PROBST: There is no sign of a merge.
555,00:38:32.58,00:38:32.58,It could be tomorrow. It could never come.
556,00:38:35.04,00:38:35.04,Now you're down to five. They're at four.
557,00:38:39.21,00:38:39.21,"So, Adam, criteria now? >> You know, I think Rebecca"
558,00:38:43.71,00:38:43.71,stood out as one that wasn't productive.
559,00:38:47.04,00:38:47.04,And there's no one else that does.
560,00:38:49.21,00:38:49.21,So this is going to be much tougher.
561,00:38:52.25,00:38:52.25,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to vote."
562,00:38:55.54,00:38:55.54,"Candice, you're up. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
563,00:39:32.25,00:39:32.25,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
564,00:39:44.88,00:39:44.88,decision is final. The person voted out will be
565,00:39:46.92,00:39:46.92,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
566,00:39:49.12,00:39:49.12,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Jonathan."
