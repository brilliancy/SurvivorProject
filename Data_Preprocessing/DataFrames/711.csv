381,00:22:43.23,00:22:43.23,"Well, back to the gameyou go, my man."
382,00:22:47.47,00:22:47.47,"Ten days, man. Ten days.>> Hey, hey!"
383,00:22:54.00,00:22:54.00,">> What's up, dude?>> Dan doesn't like it here."
384,00:22:56.43,00:22:56.43,">> You didn't love our home,Thunder D?"

394,00:23:36.53,00:23:36.53,because right now we feel likeTijuana has the power
395,00:23:40.13,00:23:40.13,to make a move eitheragainst us or with us.
396,00:23:43.53,00:23:43.53,My only hope is for them torealize that they cannot trust
397,00:23:46.73,00:23:46.73,Jon and Burton.Jon used to always say that
398,00:23:49.93,00:23:49.93,Christa was the strongest femaleon both tribes.
399,00:23:52.97,00:23:52.97,"That's why, if Christa goes...That's why Christa's going."
400,00:23:55.90,00:23:55.90,">> Right.>> Darrah's going before, 'cause"
401,00:23:57.50,00:23:57.50,they don't worry about Darrah.>> Right.
402,00:24:00.23,00:24:00.23,>> They know you're physical andyou might be Jon's competition.
403,00:24:03.77,00:24:03.77,"As strong as Burton is,I wouldn't doubt if that ..."
404,00:24:06.13,00:24:06.13,is going to win all theseimmunities.
405,00:24:07.60,00:24:07.60,"If you don't watch your back,it's going to be those three"
406,00:24:11.30,00:24:11.30,against just you two.He's a force to reckon with.
407,00:24:14.67,00:24:14.67,And Tijuana just looked at usand just listened to the whole
408,00:24:18.43,00:24:18.43,"thing, and she didn't commenton anything."
409,00:24:26.80,00:24:26.80,">> Well, let's go for a walk.>> Burton and Jon decided"
410,00:24:31.13,00:24:31.13,"to go off on a walk.And a lot of the times,"
411,00:24:35.17,00:24:35.17,"I sneak up, just to hearwhat's going on."
412,00:24:37.90,00:24:37.90,That's how I alwayshave a working knowledge
413,00:24:39.53,00:24:39.53,"of what's going on,what's going to happen next."

416,00:24:47.03,00:24:47.03,"over to Tijuana and I said,""You got to come with me now."""
417,00:24:50.47,00:24:50.47,"She's like, ""I want you to hearwhat I think is going on"
418,00:24:53.50,00:24:53.50,"and, um, you can be the judgeversus listening to me."""
419,00:25:05.33,00:25:05.33,>> I hope it will gosmoothly tomorrow.

422,00:25:14.67,00:25:14.67,"right, we'll talk to Lillabout the top three."
423,00:25:16.43,00:25:16.43,>> I thought I heard somethingalong the lines

428,00:25:32.83,00:25:32.83,Then they've got to vote with ustomorrow.

430,00:25:37.07,00:25:37.07,>> The timing was perfect.It was better for her to hear
431,00:25:40.13,00:25:40.13,with her own ears coming out oftheir mouths than for me to put
432,00:25:42.97,00:25:42.97,things in her headand for her to have doubts.
433,00:25:44.70,00:25:44.70,There's no doubts now.>> I'm not worried about you.
434,00:25:48.60,00:25:48.60,I'm not worried about me.>> So... I'm not worried
435,00:25:50.90,00:25:50.90,"about Lill, actually.>> You keep working T."
436,00:25:54.20,00:25:54.20,It sounds like you gota good connection there.
437,00:25:55.97,00:25:55.97,>> Uh-huh.>> I'm going to talk to D.
438,00:25:58.50,00:25:58.50,>> It just kind of let merefocus on how to play

440,00:26:02.80,00:26:02.80,a heads up on things and how Iwould like to play the game.
441,00:26:09.63,00:26:09.63,"So, thereafter, I told Darraheverything that I heard"
442,00:26:11.90,00:26:11.90,and I let her know thatwe need to regroup.
443,00:26:14.57,00:26:14.57,"We need to have a differentplan, because our alliance"
444,00:26:16.73,00:26:16.73,"is going to be kicking us out,most likely, fourth and fifth."

552,00:34:07.30,00:34:07.30,"But for right now, the objectiveis for Burton to go home,"
553,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,"so he can be crushed tonight.Just like Rupert was crushed,"
554,00:34:15.47,00:34:15.47,"he'll be crushed.>> I understand the decision,"

571,00:35:01.50,00:35:01.50,>> I want T to go.I don't think she ...
572,00:35:03.60,00:35:03.60,deserves it.She pissed me off.

600,00:36:39.50,00:36:39.50,the finger at Christa'cause she put her water canteen
601,00:36:42.53,00:36:42.53,"under the shelter.We were all hungry, we wanted"
602,00:36:44.37,00:36:44.37,"to eat Rupert's fish,but nobody ate jack."

614,00:37:24.77,00:37:24.77,with his friend.Did you get the information
615,00:37:27.90,00:37:27.90,you wanted?>> Yeah.
616,00:37:29.43,00:37:29.43,Definitely one of the saddestdays of my entire life.
617,00:37:31.43,00:37:31.43,"But I have to say, uh,it-it really meant a lot to me,"
618,00:37:35.60,00:37:35.60,"uh, for everyone to-tocome together like that"

623,00:37:47.97,00:37:47.97,"um, at least for myself,the game no longer mattered"
624,00:37:51.63,00:37:51.63,to me.It was about Jon and him needing
625,00:37:54.03,00:37:54.03,information to live outsideof this game.
626,00:37:56.53,00:37:56.53,"After that, it went back to thegame, and after that, we are now"
627,00:38:00.10,00:38:00.10,"still... there's a lot oftension between, um, some of us."
628,00:38:03.10,00:38:03.10,"And, um, it's-it's-it's...it's definitely chaos."

630,00:38:09.53,00:38:09.53,>> I would like to thinkI could trust a lot of people.
631,00:38:12.07,00:38:12.07,But you don't have to trustsomeone to have an alliance
632,00:38:15.07,00:38:15.07,with them.You just have to have
633,00:38:16.60,00:38:16.60,"the same interests.You could hate someone's guts,"
634,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,but if you could help them getfarther and they could
635,00:38:20.67,00:38:20.67,"help you go farther,hey, we've got an alliance."
636,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,">> PROBST: You know, after 30days, you form relationships"
637,00:38:25.43,00:38:25.43,"with people.And, obviously, it's hard to"
638,00:38:28.10,00:38:28.10,"trust people because it's agame, but at a certain point,"
639,00:38:30.57,00:38:30.57,"Jon, are you willing to betrayanybody in this game"
640,00:38:33.40,00:38:33.40,"to get what you want?>> Several days ago, yes."
641,00:38:36.87,00:38:36.87,"At this point, I don't think so.>> PROBST: Why the change"
642,00:38:40.37,00:38:40.37,of heart?>> I-I've had a...
643,00:38:42.27,00:38:42.27,"I've had a rough few days, man.I mean, I'll be honest with you,"
644,00:38:47.03,00:38:47.03,"you know, uh...priorities changed a little bit."
645,00:38:49.50,00:38:49.50,"You know?>> PROBST: Darrah, you have"
646,00:38:51.77,00:38:51.77,immunity.I'm sure it feels good.
647,00:38:54.53,00:38:54.53,It is yours to give awayif you'd like to.
648,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,Is there anybody you wantto give that up to?
649,00:38:59.57,00:38:59.57,Darrah is the only personyou cannot vote for.
650,00:39:01.57,00:39:01.57,Everybody else is fair game.It's time to vote.
651,00:39:03.60,00:39:03.60,"Sandra, you're up.>> Burton, I'm voting for you"
652,00:39:21.43,00:39:21.43,only because you're the biggestthreat we have right now.
653,00:39:35.63,00:39:35.63,">> T, I know it's your birthdaytomorrow, and I don't think"

656,00:39:53.37,00:39:53.37,differences in what you weretelling us versus
657,00:39:55.50,00:39:55.50,what you told Jon.>> PROBST: I'll go tally
658,00:40:14.03,00:40:14.03,"the votes.Once the votes are read,"
659,00:40:27.67,00:40:27.67,the decision is final.The person voted out will be
660,00:40:30.10,00:40:30.10,asked to leave theTribal Council area immediately.
661,00:40:32.53,00:40:32.53,I'll read the votes.First vote:
662,00:40:40.27,00:40:40.27,Burton.Tijuana.
663,00:40:51.00,00:40:51.00,Burton.That's two votes Burton.
664,00:40:58.50,00:40:58.50,Tijuana.A happy birthday.
665,00:41:01.60,00:41:01.60,"That's two votes T,two votes Burton."
666,00:41:08.17,00:41:08.17,"T. Three votes T,two votes Burton."
667,00:41:14.47,00:41:14.47,Tenth person voted outof the tribe: T.
668,00:41:18.97,00:41:18.97,You need to bring me your torch.That's four votes.
669,00:41:21.07,00:41:21.07,That's enough.Last vote will remain a mystery.
670,00:41:29.93,00:41:29.93,"T, the tribe has spoken.Burton said it best."
671,00:41:50.03,00:41:50.03,It's not about trust anymore.It's about mutually
672,00:41:52.63,00:41:52.63,beneficial interests.You guys can head back to camp.
