558,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,I didn't want to make it asurprise.
559,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,">> Hey, you know, my fault.My bad."
560,00:35:39.08,00:35:39.08,I got to take responsibility forthat.
561,00:35:41.67,00:35:41.67,"And as much as I, you know,would, you know, love to stay--"
562,00:35:44.71,00:35:44.71,"I want to be here-- hey, youscrew up, you got to... you"
563,00:35:49.33,00:35:49.33,"know, you got to take the hit.>> Dan and I have something even"
564,00:35:53.08,00:35:53.08,more in common than anybodyelse-- soaring to all kinds of
565,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,heights above the Earth-- andhaving to vote him off is a
566,00:35:58.50,00:35:58.50,"highly emotional decision,because he's something else."
567,00:36:03.58,00:36:03.58,Dan has the right stuff.>> PROBST: Welcome back to
568,00:36:28.79,00:36:28.79,Tribal Council.Let's start by talking about who
569,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,"is not here.Austin, how big a part of this"
570,00:36:35.92,00:36:35.92,"tribe is Sally?>> She's a huge part, but you"
571,00:36:39.04,00:36:39.04,"know, we had the boys' club andSally, um, but she was saved by"
572,00:36:42.71,00:36:42.71,"the move that, um, Casaya madetoday."
573,00:36:45.88,00:36:45.88,">> PROBST: So, Nick, it wasgoing to be Sally, the next"
574,00:36:47.75,00:36:47.75,"out?>> Yeah, Sally would have been"
575,00:36:49.54,00:36:49.54,"next.>> PROBST: Terry, do you think"
576,00:36:51.58,00:36:51.58,Casaya knew that?Sensed that?
577,00:36:53.46,00:36:53.46,>> It was immediately known thatthey were going to pick Sally.
578,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,That meant that we four guys hadto vote one of us out.
579,00:36:59.62,00:36:59.62,"So, a maybe stronger player isnow going to be leaving the"
580,00:37:02.25,00:37:02.25,"game, versus having Sally inthere, so it was a smart"
581,00:37:05.71,00:37:05.71,"strategic move by their point,big time."
582,00:37:08.29,00:37:08.29,">> PROBST: Nick, how tight isthis group?"
583,00:37:10.75,00:37:10.75,Because it's about to besplintered.
584,00:37:12.75,00:37:12.75,">> The group's amazingly tight.I mean, we were able to talk"
585,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,openly tonight.It's not a surprise to who's
586,00:37:17.96,00:37:17.96,"going to be leaving tonight.It's understood that, you know,"
587,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,"when you're part of a team, youmight be the weaker physical,"
588,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,you might be the weaker mental--whatever your role is-- and we
589,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,accept that.So it's-it's been a very
590,00:37:28.79,00:37:28.79,"businesslike process tonight.>> PROBST: Well, I'm looking at"
591,00:37:31.12,00:37:31.12,"the four of you, and so far,nobody's face is giving anything"
592,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,"away.I don't know if it's you,"
593,00:37:34.88,00:37:34.88,"Austin, Terry or Dan.>> It's me."
594,00:37:37.62,00:37:37.62,"Uh, they were very up-front withme to tell me that, uh, it's my"
595,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"turn tonight to go, and today,three people performed their"
596,00:37:45.04,00:37:45.04,"job, and two people didn't.And one of those two people is"
597,00:37:48.71,00:37:48.71,"immune, and the other one issitting right here."
598,00:37:51.71,00:37:51.71,And I'm willing to takeresponsibility.
599,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,"At the same time, I'd be lyingif I didn't say I was kind of"
600,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,"hoping, uh, that it was going togo maybe a two v. two."
601,00:38:00.25,00:38:00.25,>> PROBST: Meaning a tiebetween...
602,00:38:02.04,00:38:02.04,">> A tie, you know, and Terryand I go one way, and, uh, Nick"
603,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,"and Austin go the other way.>> PROBST: Terry, there's an"
604,00:38:06.88,00:38:06.88,obvious two versus two scenario.Did that go through your head
605,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,"at any point?>> Strategically, we weren't"
606,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,"going to have to do this tillwe got to the final four, and"
607,00:38:14.54,00:38:14.54,"now we're the final four of thistribe, and what I'm doing is,"
608,00:38:18.38,00:38:18.38,"uh, making a managerialdecision."
609,00:38:20.38,00:38:20.38,">> PROBST: Austin, was it clearin your mind that there was one"
610,00:38:23.83,00:38:23.83,person who just needed to go?They're holding us back.
611,00:38:27.75,00:38:27.75,>> I would never use those wordsto say about my buddy Dan Berry.
612,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,There's nothing about him thatneeds to go.
613,00:38:34.04,00:38:34.04,We are just down to a situationwhere somebody has to go.
614,00:38:36.96,00:38:36.96,Dan was the weakest of the fourof us.
615,00:38:39.96,00:38:39.96,">> PROBST: Dan, what will thistribe be losing if you go home"
616,00:38:42.54,00:38:42.54,tonight?>> I do a lot around the camp.
617,00:38:45.21,00:38:45.21,"I built the fire shelter.I built the, uh, fireplace."
618,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,"Uh, Dan Fuego-- I-I take care ofthat part."
619,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,"Um, I'm pretty good in thewater, and in general, I'm a"
620,00:38:54.42,00:38:54.42,great puzzle solver.I don't know what happened
621,00:38:57.00,00:38:57.00,today.But they are losing a
622,00:38:59.08,00:38:59.08,"substantial contributor.>> PROBST: So, Dan, are you just"
623,00:39:02.08,00:39:02.08,"taking the sword on this one?>> No, I'm not."
624,00:39:05.08,00:39:05.08,"Absolutely not.If it was my choice, this would"
625,00:39:07.79,00:39:07.79,"go two v. two, and we'd havea little challenge going on"
626,00:39:09.96,00:39:09.96,here.I expected to last a lot longer
627,00:39:11.96,00:39:11.96,"than this.And in fact, yesterday, I"
628,00:39:14.50,00:39:14.50,thought I was lasting a lotlonger.
629,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,"You know, I'm-I'm solid withfive people."
630,00:39:19.04,00:39:19.04,"I know there's one person infront of me, for sure, if we"
631,00:39:21.04,00:39:21.04,were to lose again.It's just... it's incredible how
632,00:39:24.08,00:39:24.08,"fast things turn.>> PROBST: Okay, so it does seem"
633,00:39:27.08,00:39:27.08,"like tonight's vote is a bit ofa foregone conclusion, but I've"
634,00:39:30.17,00:39:30.17,"seen weirder things happen.Well, Terry, you have been to"
635,00:39:34.71,00:39:34.71,Exile Island.The immunity idol could come
636,00:39:36.75,00:39:36.75,into play.You'll let me know after the
637,00:39:38.62,00:39:38.62,vote if that is indeed the case.It is time to vote.
638,00:39:41.12,00:39:41.12,"Nick, you're up.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
639,00:40:13.00,00:40:13.00,"votes.Once the votes are read, the"
640,00:40:24.75,00:40:24.75,decision is final.The person voted out will be
641,00:40:26.54,00:40:26.54,asked to leave the TribalCouncil area immediately.
642,00:40:28.54,00:40:28.54,"I'll read the votes.First vote, Dan."
643,00:40:38.00,00:40:38.00,Austin.Dan.
644,00:40:44.50,00:40:44.50,"That's two votes Dan, one voteAustin, one vote left."
645,00:40:51.21,00:40:51.21,"Sixth person voted out ofSurvivor: Exile Island, Dan."
646,00:40:54.50,00:40:54.50,"You need to bring me your torch.>> Good luck, my boys."
647,00:40:57.50,00:40:57.50,"(indistinct chatter)>> PROBST: Dan, the tribe has"
648,00:41:07.00,00:41:07.00,spoken.Time to go.
649,00:41:11.96,00:41:11.96,">> See you, Dan-o.>> See you, Dan."
650,00:41:23.33,00:41:23.33,>> PROBST: Seemed like a toughvote.
651,00:41:25.54,00:41:25.54,"Probably won't be your last.Grab your torches, head back to"
652,00:41:28.12,00:41:28.12,camp.Good night.
