10,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67,"Bruce really having trouble. But Sally struggled, and Bobby"
11,00:00:27.08,00:00:27.08,chopped his way to victory for Casaya.
12,00:00:30.21,00:00:30.21,Casaya wins reward! >> Tonight we eat!
13,00:00:32.88,00:00:32.88,">> PROBST: Casaya won fresh fish, rice, beans, spices and"

15,00:00:40.75,00:00:40.75,"had their leader sent, once again, to Exile Island."
16,00:00:44.04,00:00:44.04,">> Good luck, Terry. (thunder crashing)"
17,00:00:47.21,00:00:47.21,>> PROBST: Casaya returned to find their camp underwater.
18,00:00:50.12,00:00:50.12,">> This is a nightmare. >> We have a top of fish, but"
19,00:00:52.88,00:00:52.88,we can't cook it. Everything is wet.
20,00:00:55.21,00:00:55.21,">> PROBST: But even without fire, they managed to make the"
21,00:00:58.62,00:00:58.62,most of their reward. >> I've never eaten raw fish.
22,00:01:02.12,00:01:02.12,I hope I don't wake up in the morning with some kind of
23,00:01:04.67,00:01:04.67,"sickness or something. >> PROBST: At La Mina, the"
24,00:01:08.75,00:01:08.75,tribe devoured their first nourishment in days...
25,00:01:12.42,00:01:12.42,but the beans were too much for Nick and Austin's stomachs.
26,00:01:16.21,00:01:16.21,">> Well, I got to go again. >> That stuff just wrecked me."
27,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,">> PROBST: Back at Casaya, Bobby and Bruce spent some"
28,00:01:22.71,00:01:22.71,quality time in the outhouse. >> Excuse me.
29,00:01:31.92,00:01:31.92,">> PROBST: And in the morning, they paid the price."
30,00:01:34.17,00:01:34.17,>> What happened to that last bottle of wine?
31,00:01:38.25,00:01:38.25,>> Someone would have to pour it down my throat for me to
32,00:01:40.25,00:01:40.25,"drink the last bottle of wine that we, as a tribe, won."
33,00:01:43.00,00:01:43.00,">> You really made a bad, bad call."
34,00:01:45.33,00:01:45.33,>> I don't feel bad that I stole your wine.
35,00:01:47.21,00:01:47.21,"Like, I feel bad that I deprived them of wine, but I have no hard"
36,00:01:49.42,00:01:49.42,"feelings, whatsoever, about the fact that you've been deprived"
37,00:01:51.21,00:01:51.21,of wine. >> PROBST: At the immunity

41,00:02:00.88,00:02:00.88,"La Mina wins immunity! Back at Casaya, the alliance of"
42,00:02:04.62,00:02:04.62,"Shane, Aras, Courtney and Danielle made their decision."
43,00:02:09.08,00:02:09.08,>> No other discussion. Bobby goes down on the carpet.
44,00:02:11.54,00:02:11.54,>> PROBST: But Aras changed the plan.
45,00:02:13.25,00:02:13.25,">> We cannot control Bruce. >> This is really stupid, but"
46,00:02:18.62,00:02:18.62,all right. >> PROBST: Then Danielle
47,00:02:20.96,00:02:20.96,changed the plan again. >> Keep Bruce.
48,00:02:23.96,00:02:23.96,"I'm telling you, it's a better decision for all of us."
49,00:02:27.17,00:02:27.17,>> PROBST: And Shane was irritated with his tribe's
50,00:02:29.42,00:02:29.42,flip-flopping. >> Why didn't you tell me that
51,00:02:31.96,00:02:31.96,"an hour ago, Courtney? I told everybody, initially,"
52,00:02:34.75,00:02:34.75,"that Bobby should go, and then they freaked out and said"
53,00:02:37.25,00:02:37.25,"nothing-- they're like women. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
54,00:02:39.96,00:02:39.96,the voting was erratic. But three votes were enough to
55,00:02:44.21,00:02:44.21,make Bobby the fifth person voted out of the game.
56,00:02:48.04,00:02:48.04,"Bobby, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left."
57,00:02:53.58,00:02:53.58,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
58,00:03:38.17,00:03:38.17,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa (thunder crashes, birds and"
59,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,insects hoot and chitter) >> I know Bruce is in here.
60,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,"I'm not worried about it. Listen, why do I have to"
61,00:04:52.75,00:04:52.75,"worry about anybody, homey? >> I don't know where all this"
62,00:04:56.00,00:04:56.00,anger is coming from. And I don't appreciate you
63,00:04:58.04,00:04:58.04,"directing it towards me, so can we just talk about this"
64,00:05:01.21,00:05:01.21,tomorrow? Because I don't feel like
65,00:05:03.21,00:05:03.21,getting into a huge fight with you.
66,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,It's not worth it. >> I want to get out of the
67,00:05:06.92,00:05:06.92,"alliance that I'm in with you guys, but I can't do that"
68,00:05:10.25,00:05:10.25,"unless you guys allow me to take my son's name back, so..."
69,00:05:13.54,00:05:13.54,>> Why would you say that? >> Because I don't trust that
70,00:05:16.12,00:05:16.12,you guys are going to make the right decisions.
71,00:05:18.50,00:05:18.50,I'd rather go into the merge a lone wolf than have to deal
72,00:05:23.12,00:05:23.12,"with you and Courtney. >> I don't know, like, I don't"
73,00:05:27.12,00:05:27.12,know why you're... you have all this anger towards me and you're
74,00:05:29.96,00:05:29.96,"going to start bashing me now, because you're going to go"
75,00:05:32.12,00:05:32.12,"through one of your manic, crazy spasms."
76,00:05:36.25,00:05:36.25,I don't need to deal with it. I don't want to deal with it.
77,00:05:38.54,00:05:38.54,I'm going to bed. If you still feel like that
78,00:05:40.71,00:05:40.71,"tomorrow, then bring it up tomorrow and we'll argue"
79,00:05:42.92,00:05:42.92,"tomorrow, okay? Because I just... I don't need"
80,00:05:46.38,00:05:46.38,"you bashing me. >> I know, you're such a"
81,00:05:49.21,00:05:49.21,"victim, Danielle. >> I know... I am."
82,00:05:54.79,00:05:54.79,(thunder rumbling) >> Like that.
83,00:06:47.38,00:06:47.38,"We got one, two, three, four. (grunts, sputters)"
84,00:06:52.08,00:06:52.08,">> Courtney had decided to sleep on the beach last night,"
85,00:06:55.25,00:06:55.25,so I had to catch Courtney up... (laughing)
86,00:06:59.79,00:06:59.79,"...on, uh, Shane's wanting to leave their alliance."
87,00:07:04.25,00:07:04.25,"You know, she has to know. (laughing)"
88,00:07:08.25,00:07:08.25,"Um, so Courtney decided, well, let's get rid of Shane."
89,00:07:12.83,00:07:12.83,"""Wouldn't that be amazing?"" is what she said."
90,00:07:15.25,00:07:15.25,"I'm like, ""Oh, okay. Huh."" (laughing)"
91,00:07:32.08,00:07:32.08,>> Out. (laughing quietly)
92,00:07:38.62,00:07:38.62,"Last night, we get back to the shelter, and Shane has one of"
93,00:07:42.88,00:07:42.88,"his crazy, manic, psycho fits again, and he's next."
94,00:07:48.62,00:07:48.62,That's the bottom line. He's such an idiot.
95,00:07:50.83,00:07:50.83,I can't stand him. >> Yeah.
96,00:07:52.83,00:07:52.83,>> He's such a moron. I cannot wait to vote him off.
97,00:07:55.12,00:07:55.12,>> He's so getting what he deserves.
98,00:07:58.62,00:07:58.62,>> He's just a lunatic. He's lost his mind.
99,00:08:02.08,00:08:02.08,"He's just a freak. (whispering): ""I want out of"
100,00:08:05.29,00:08:05.29,"the alliance with you and Courtney."""
101,00:08:08.54,00:08:08.54,And then he's saying that he wants nothing to do with me and
102,00:08:11.12,00:08:11.12,"Courtney. You know, ""I want out."
103,00:08:13.96,00:08:13.96,You guys are disorganized. I don't like the way the Tribal
104,00:08:16.42,00:08:16.42,"Council went down."" Well, if that's how you feel"
105,00:08:18.62,00:08:18.62,"about it, then fine. Get out of the alliance."
106,00:08:20.62,00:08:20.62,"You're off anyway, who cares? See you later."
107,00:08:24.00,00:08:24.00,Bye. >> This is so on the down-low.
108,00:08:26.75,00:08:26.75,"It's going to be a stealth chop the head off, guillotine"
109,00:08:33.42,00:08:33.42,style. >> It's beautiful out here.
110,00:08:52.58,00:08:52.58,Another beautiful day in paradise.
111,00:08:54.58,00:08:54.58,I'm taking a quiet moment to enjoy it.
112,00:09:05.54,00:09:05.54,"I've been within 200 miles of this spot many times,"
113,00:09:10.12,00:09:10.12,vertically. Good morning.
114,00:09:15.88,00:09:15.88,>> I feel really groggy today. >> I'm going to get the fire
115,00:09:18.17,00:09:18.17,"on, and then we'll warm up the beans."
116,00:09:22.04,00:09:22.04,>> They taste a little better. >> It's been a rough couple of
117,00:09:26.21,00:09:26.21,days. The four guys are kind of
118,00:09:28.25,00:09:28.25,"doing, like, a boys' club thing. But I think it's shortsighted."
119,00:09:32.50,00:09:32.50,"These guys think that they know how the game works, but, like,"
120,00:09:35.79,00:09:35.79,I'd be very surprised if the all-man's club ended up lasting
121,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,as long as they think it would. >> These are little minnows.
122,00:09:44.38,00:09:44.38,They're caught in this pond  here.
123,00:09:46.54,00:09:46.54,"They're tiny, tiny, but they're salty."
124,00:09:49.04,00:09:49.04,They're better than nothing. They are protein.
125,00:09:55.67,00:09:55.67,>> I've been fantasizing about food since day two.
126,00:09:57.92,00:09:57.92,"I can't stop, no matter what I do."
127,00:10:00.12,00:10:00.12,"If we could get some food in our stomachs, this whole game"
128,00:10:02.50,00:10:02.50,could change. You'd think I was diving for
129,00:10:04.79,00:10:04.79,friggin' chicken nuggets down here.
130,00:10:07.88,00:10:07.88,I... got one. Don't you move.
131,00:10:16.50,00:10:16.50,Food. He's going down the hatch.
132,00:10:24.12,00:10:24.12,"Boy, did he taste awful. Ugh!"
133,00:10:33.17,00:10:33.17,">> Hey, Nick. >> Yeah?"
134,00:10:52.92,00:10:52.92,As in? >> While they were flying.
135,00:10:55.88,00:10:55.88,>> As in when they were flying? You've got to be kidding me?
136,00:10:58.21,00:10:58.21,">> Yeah. Three space shuttle flights, uh,"
137,00:11:02.00,00:11:02.00,"once aboard the shuttle Endeavor, twice aboard shuttle"
138,00:11:05.75,00:11:05.75,"Discovery. >> Oh, my God."
139,00:11:08.42,00:11:08.42,">> It's a dream come true, what I wanted to do my whole life."
140,00:11:11.58,00:11:11.58,">> Dan, that's unbelievable. I never thought I'd even meet"
141,00:11:14.58,00:11:14.58,"an astronaut, never mind live with one."
142,00:11:17.12,00:11:17.12,"I mean, the guy has looked at Earth from space."
143,00:11:19.29,00:11:19.29,"So he's, he's an incredible guy, and I knew that from the start."
144,00:11:22.62,00:11:22.62,"To learn that and how humble he is about, um, being an astronaut"
145,00:11:26.04,00:11:26.04,is... is pretty amazing. >> You wouldn't believe how many
146,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,people told me I could never be an astronaut.
147,00:11:31.46,00:11:31.46,"I've been to orbit three times, on space shuttles, I've done"
148,00:11:34.25,00:11:34.25,"four space walks, I've been to space station twice."
149,00:11:37.21,00:11:37.21,">> Man, I need to come up with something, 'cause I got nothing."
150,00:11:40.17,00:11:40.17,">> Hey, Nick, you and I, we got nothing time, though, baby."
151,00:11:42.67,00:11:42.67,">> That's true. >> Man, that's awesome though,"
152,00:11:44.67,00:11:44.67,dude. He actually has dined with Neil
153,00:11:46.67,00:11:46.67,Armstrong. Dan Flago is a stud.
154,00:11:49.04,00:11:49.04,I told you from the get-go. He's a pimp.
155,00:11:51.12,00:11:51.12,">> You know what, it  wasn't like hiding anything from you."
156,00:11:53.12,00:11:53.12,"It was because I didn't want to be, you know, the ""astronaut"""
157,00:11:55.12,00:11:55.12,guy. I just wanted to be Dan.
158,00:11:57.12,00:11:57.12,"We've become really good friends, and I don't want to"
159,00:11:59.12,00:11:59.12,keep the secret from them anymore.
160,00:12:01.12,00:12:01.12,This is just another way for us to... to bond.
161,00:12:04.92,00:12:04.92,>> I guess I need to come clean. My real name is John Grisham.
162,00:12:08.00,00:12:08.00,">> I was going to say, yeah. >> Sunshine again."
163,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17,"So happy. >> Usually, in a normal"
164,00:12:52.38,00:12:52.38,"alliance, we could say, ""Listen, I just want to be out of this."""
165,00:12:56.67,00:12:56.67,But I can't really do that because I... I swore on my kid's
166,00:13:00.04,00:13:00.04,life that I'd stay with you guys.
167,00:13:02.38,00:13:02.38,">> What, what, why are you so upset?"
168,00:13:04.38,00:13:04.38,">> I'm not. Listen, I don't, I don't want to"
169,00:13:06.25,00:13:06.25,"talk about that. I want to really, I want to ask"
170,00:13:08.25,00:13:08.25,you guys if I can take my son's name...
171,00:13:10.25,00:13:10.25,>> Done. >> Done? Courtney?
172,00:13:12.96,00:13:12.96,">> I don't, you're, you're making a mistake right now."
173,00:13:15.04,00:13:15.04,I don't see... >> I'm not making a mistake.
174,00:13:16.88,00:13:16.88,I'm never gonna ever be beholden to people that make decisions
175,00:13:19.62,00:13:19.62,based on personal feelings. You guys voted Bobby out of
176,00:13:23.79,00:13:23.79,"here because you, Bobby pissed you off five days ago."
177,00:13:25.79,00:13:25.79,>> Negative. >> No.
178,00:13:27.79,00:13:27.79,">> Okay. >> I stuck to the original plan,"
179,00:13:29.79,00:13:29.79,"so if you want to get angry at someone for flipping, then you"
180,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,should get angry at me. >> I did.
181,00:13:34.21,00:13:34.21,I got angry at Courtney. I told... I got angry at
182,00:13:36.21,00:13:36.21,"Courtney, got angry at... >> You lashed out at me last"
183,00:13:38.21,00:13:38.21,"night. >> Like, all you're doing is"
184,00:13:40.21,00:13:40.21,"lashing out at people. >> Oh, all I do is lash out at"
185,00:13:42.08,00:13:42.08,everyone. >> You do.
186,00:13:44.08,00:13:44.08,">> It's terrible, awful. >> You guys do nothing."

190,00:13:56.71,00:13:56.71,I don't want to hear it. Don't lash out at me again.
191,00:14:00.12,00:14:00.12,I don't need it. Honestly.
192,00:14:01.92,00:14:01.92,"I'm not here for that. I came here to enjoy myself, not"
193,00:14:04.88,00:14:04.88,to have people demean me. >> I second that motion.
194,00:14:13.25,00:14:13.25,>> I haven't lashed out at you in days.
195,00:14:15.75,00:14:15.75,>> You were horribly disrespectful to me yesterday.
196,00:14:18.58,00:14:18.58,What are you mumbling about over there?
197,00:14:20.83,00:14:20.83,I mean... >> You don't even realize...
198,00:14:23.21,00:14:23.21,>> You don't even realize how mean you are.
199,00:14:25.12,00:14:25.12,">> You just talk so down to people, like..."
200,00:14:27.92,00:14:27.92,>> It's funny how you two are the only two that have a problem
201,00:14:30.21,00:14:30.21,with it. >> We're the only ones who need
202,00:14:32.58,00:14:32.58,to say anything about it. >> I'm done.

207,00:14:45.46,00:14:45.46,going to keep his mouth shut. I don't respect the way he
208,00:14:47.46,00:14:47.46,treats other people. And I don't want to be a part
209,00:14:49.46,00:14:49.46,"of that. If I have a choice, I don't want"
210,00:14:51.83,00:14:51.83,"to be a part of it. So truth be told, I think it's"
211,00:14:53.96,00:14:53.96,great the alliance is broken up because it's a paper tiger.
212,00:14:57.12,00:14:57.12,There's no power to this alliance anymore.

231,00:16:25.58,00:16:25.58,>> This is the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
232,00:16:27.29,00:16:27.29,>> Immunity and reward. >> That's awesome!
233,00:16:28.88,00:16:28.88,>> This could be immunity. Immunity.
234,00:16:31.46,00:16:31.46,"Let's, let's, let's pare the numbers down today, you guys."
235,00:16:33.79,00:16:33.79,>> I'll die if we don't win this.

243,00:16:53.88,00:16:53.88,">> Strength and smarts. >> If we lose, Sally most likely"
244,00:16:56.58,00:16:56.58,will be gone and we're gonna be hurting big time.
245,00:16:59.58,00:16:59.58,"So, uh, we're totally stoked. This, this is, this is game"
246,00:17:02.29,00:17:02.29,"seven of the World Series. >> PROBST: La Mina, come on in!"

254,00:17:44.71,00:17:44.71,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs because today's"
255,00:17:48.29,00:17:48.29,challenge is for both reward and immunity.
256,00:17:52.17,00:17:52.17,"Here's how it works. On my ""go,"" three members from"
257,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,each tribe will race out to the field to collect puzzle pieces.
258,00:17:59.21,00:17:59.21,"You'll go one at a time. You'll untie it, lower it,"
259,00:18:02.21,00:18:02.21,"unhook it, bring it back. Once you have all four pieces,"
260,00:18:07.50,00:18:07.50,the two remaining tribe members will use those pieces to solve
261,00:18:11.50,00:18:11.50,a spinning puzzle. First tribe to solve it
262,00:18:14.46,00:18:14.46,correctly wins reward. Want to know what you're
263,00:18:16.42,00:18:16.42,playing for? >> Yeah.
264,00:18:18.42,00:18:18.42,>> Definitely. >> PROBST: Everything you need

270,00:18:37.17,00:18:37.17,"soft drinks, the works. And that's not all."
271,00:18:40.75,00:18:40.75,"While the winners are partying, the losers will be at Tribal"
272,00:18:44.46,00:18:44.46,"Council tonight, where somebody will be voted out."
273,00:18:48.33,00:18:48.33,"And as always, the winning tribe gets to choose one member"
274,00:18:52.21,00:18:52.21,from the losing tribe to send to Exile Island.
275,00:18:54.92,00:18:54.92,"The difference is, this time, the person you send to Exile"
276,00:18:58.54,00:18:58.54,Island will not go to Tribal Council tonight.
277,00:19:02.42,00:19:02.42,That means they cannot be voted out.
278,00:19:05.92,00:19:05.92,"So instead of punishing somebody, you are protecting"
279,00:19:08.50,00:19:08.50,somebody. Big stakes at this point in the
280,00:19:10.92,00:19:10.92,game. Worth playing for?
281,00:19:12.92,00:19:12.92,"(all agreeing) >> PROBST: Casaya, you have one"

290,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,"La Mina, who is going to gather puzzle pieces for you guys?"
291,00:19:34.92,00:19:34.92,">> Terry, Austin, and Nick. >> PROBST: Terry, Austin, Nick."
292,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,That means Dan and Sally will solve the puzzle.

376,00:23:31.08,00:23:31.08,">> This one. >> Spin yours a little bit,"
377,00:23:33.08,00:23:33.08,Bruce. >> PROBST: Casaya working on
378,00:23:35.12,00:23:35.12,their third piece. Casaya has their third piece.
379,00:23:40.62,00:23:40.62,La Mina falling farther and farther behind.
380,00:23:43.71,00:23:43.71,"A lot a stake-- a big reward feast, immunity, power over"
381,00:23:48.42,00:23:48.42,who goes to Exile Island. Casaya right on the edge of the
382,00:23:52.58,00:23:52.58,"last piece, if they can get it to fit."
383,00:23:56.29,00:23:56.29,La Mina still working. >> Step on it. Step on it.
384,00:23:59.58,00:23:59.58,>> PROBST: Casaya wins reward and immunity!
385,00:24:03.29,00:24:03.29,"(Casaya tribe cheering) >> You did it, Bruce!"
386,00:24:14.54,00:24:14.54,">> PROBST: Casaya, huge win. >> Bruce, you hold that,"
387,00:24:17.54,00:24:17.54,"brother. >> Good job, Bruce."
388,00:24:22.00,00:24:22.00,>> PROBST: Immunity keeps you safe from Tribal Council
389,00:24:24.38,00:24:24.38,"tonight, and you have a big decision to make."
390,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,You're going to send one person to Exile Island right now; that
391,00:24:30.08,00:24:30.08,person cannot be voted out tonight.
392,00:24:33.21,00:24:33.21,"(Casaya tribe whispering) Casaya, who's it gonna be?"
393,00:24:41.04,00:24:41.04,">> Sally. >> PROBST: Sally, going to Exile"
394,00:24:43.83,00:24:43.83,Island. Boat's waiting.
395,00:24:47.08,00:24:47.08,">> See you guys. Good job. >> PROBST: Keep in mind, Sally"
396,00:24:49.50,00:24:49.50,will get another clue to the whereabouts of the hidden
397,00:24:52.21,00:24:52.21,immunity idol. Whether or not somebody's
398,00:24:54.67,00:24:54.67,"already found it, who knows? La Mina, all I have for you is a"
399,00:24:59.21,00:24:59.21,date tonight with me at Tribal Council.
400,00:25:02.88,00:25:02.88,"Somebody going home. Grab your stuff, head on back to"
401,00:25:04.88,00:25:04.88,camp. See you at Tribal.
402,00:25:08.25,00:25:08.25,"Casaya, it's time to party. Have a good time."
403,00:25:11.88,00:25:11.88,"Boat's waiting for you. >> Exile Island, for me, is my"
404,00:25:36.04,00:25:36.04,"saving grace. In every other case, the"
405,00:25:38.54,00:25:38.54,negative downside has been to be away from the tribe.
406,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,"In this case, me being here today is a good thing, because I"
407,00:25:47.25,00:25:47.25,felt like there was a pretty strong alliance between the four
408,00:25:49.12,00:25:49.12,guys and that I would be the one to go.
409,00:25:51.42,00:25:51.42,So it put things in a really different perspective.
410,00:25:54.25,00:25:54.25,"Today, it's actually saving me. >> ""Clue number six: It is not"
411,00:26:01.21,00:26:01.21,"found here, but it is in the shade for most of the day."""
412,00:26:05.38,00:26:05.38,It's so important that I'm here right now and that I have this
413,00:26:07.71,00:26:07.71,opportunity. Assuming I don't get dumped on
414,00:26:10.21,00:26:10.21,"for the next couple of days, this is a gift to be here,"
415,00:26:12.71,00:26:12.71,"so I'm thrilled. It's like a little vacation,"
416,00:26:15.17,00:26:15.17,"some girl time, get away from all those boys for a while."
417,00:26:25.46,00:26:25.46,It's exciting and frustrating to think that there's an immunity
418,00:26:29.04,00:26:29.04,"idol out here somewhere, but it's overwhelming."
419,00:26:31.29,00:26:31.29,You really don't know where to start.
420,00:26:34.12,00:26:34.12,I'm safe tonight and I'm going to wake up tomorrow safe.
421,00:26:38.62,00:26:38.62,"I'm just privileged and giddy to still be here, so..."
422,00:26:42.12,00:26:42.12,Even it's on Exile Island by myself.
423,00:26:56.12,00:26:56.12,"(children laughing, shrieking) >> We had won the reward"
424,00:27:23.12,00:27:23.12,challenge. La Mina is demoralized.
425,00:27:25.75,00:27:25.75,We knew they were going to Tribal Council tonight.
426,00:27:28.42,00:27:28.42,We're in the middle of this Panamanian fishing village.
427,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,"We knew we were going to eat. I'm just so, so happy to be here"
428,00:27:36.79,00:27:36.79,"right now. >> I'm coming, I'm coming."
429,00:27:41.00,00:27:41.00,>> I was so joyous to see all those little kids come
430,00:27:44.46,00:27:44.46,"running up to the boat, and they just grab your hand, and"
431,00:27:47.58,00:27:47.58,they have these big smiles on their faces.
432,00:27:50.00,00:27:50.00,>> Woo-hoo! >> It was so cool.
433,00:27:52.83,00:27:52.83,"A young boy grabbed my hand and asked me if I wanted to eat,"
434,00:27:55.67,00:27:55.67,"and I was like, ""Yes, I want to eat."""
435,00:28:01.67,00:28:01.67,">> Oh! Oh, God, it is so good."
436,00:28:07.83,00:28:07.83,">> Oh, my God. >> This is the first thing other"
437,00:28:11.17,00:28:11.17,"than water I've had in 16 days. >> Oh, my God."
438,00:28:15.17,00:28:15.17,"Sure more food. They just kept handing you, you"
439,00:28:18.54,00:28:18.54,"know, rice and soup, and then some cheese with chicken and"
440,00:28:23.08,00:28:23.08,"then barbecue chicken. >> Oh, my God."
441,00:28:28.33,00:28:28.33,>> I'm so happy right now. >> I just kept eating and eating
442,00:28:33.92,00:28:33.92,and eating 'cause I... just went crazy and just at
443,00:28:36.62,00:28:36.62,"everything in sight. Oh, it was amazing."
444,00:28:42.67,00:28:42.67,>> I'm ecstatic. It was just really nice to be
445,00:28:46.92,00:28:46.92,"around people, other than these people."
446,00:28:50.08,00:28:50.08,"You know, and to see kids, that made my day."
447,00:28:54.12,00:28:54.12,Just to see those kids-- oh! Those kids remind me of my
448,00:28:58.00,00:28:58.00,"family. I saw this one little girl, she"
449,00:29:00.67,00:29:00.67,"looks exactly like my niece. Oh, God, I miss my kids so bad."
450,00:29:06.21,00:29:06.21,I can't even think about it right now.
451,00:29:09.92,00:29:09.92,It was nice. It was really good.
452,00:29:13.42,00:29:13.42,"Much needed. I know it's only day 15, but"
453,00:29:16.29,00:29:16.29,"damn, we really needed that. >> Yay!"
454,00:29:26.04,00:29:26.04,">> I saw one of the villagers smoking, and I was like, oh, no."
455,00:29:31.21,00:29:31.21,"The next thought was ""All right, I can give him my shoes and I"
456,00:29:34.83,00:29:34.83,can give him my shorts and I can give him my shirt and I can give
457,00:29:38.21,00:29:38.21,him my buff... And here's the deal-- if the guy
458,00:29:41.12,00:29:41.12,"would've been like, I want your underwear too, I probably"
459,00:29:43.46,00:29:43.46,would've been naked for the rest of the afternoon for just one
460,00:29:46.08,00:29:46.08,"cigarette. >> Shane, I'm not happy with"
461,00:29:55.88,00:29:55.88,"that, buddy. >> This is probably a really bad"
462,00:30:00.46,00:30:00.46,decision. I remember sitting there in a
463,00:30:06.50,00:30:06.50,"stupor going, ""Oh, my God, I can't believe a cigarette is"
464,00:30:09.79,00:30:09.79,"affecting me like this."" It just shows me how devastating"
465,00:30:14.71,00:30:14.71,"nicotine is to the body, on every level."
466,00:30:19.17,00:30:19.17,>> You're enjoying that way too much.
467,00:30:22.54,00:30:22.54,"Amigos, amigas. No Espanol, but this... so much."
468,00:30:29.12,00:30:29.12,">> The reward kind of brought us together, but that's the thing,"
469,00:30:32.83,00:30:32.83,it's like a double-edge sword for me.
470,00:30:35.54,00:30:35.54,"Yes, yay, we won. I won food, but now that gives"
471,00:30:39.08,00:30:39.08,Shane time to kind of backtrack. >> I'm really gonna puke.
472,00:30:45.17,00:30:45.17,>> I should never have treated you like that.
473,00:30:47.92,00:30:47.92,"I apologize, okay? >> I accept."
474,00:30:50.92,00:30:50.92,">> When we leave here, and my life is normal, I promise you"
475,00:30:53.29,00:30:53.29,that I'm going to be a different person.
476,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,And I don't owe anybody on this island anything except you.
477,00:31:04.79,00:31:04.79,">> Courtney and Danielle, they're easily persuaded by"
478,00:31:08.12,00:31:08.12,Shane's nonsense. You know what I mean? Damn!
479,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,"In a way, I almost wanted to lose, because I really felt that"
480,00:31:16.92,00:31:16.92,"Shane was going, and then hopefully, it was Bruce."
481,00:31:27.75,00:31:27.75,(karate yell) (karate yell)
482,00:31:34.12,00:31:34.12,(applause) But now that we won and
483,00:31:36.71,00:31:36.71,"everybody's all in love again, I don't know."
484,00:31:39.50,00:31:39.50,Damn! (drums playing)
485,00:31:42.58,00:31:42.58,(villagers speaking Spanish) (child squealing)
486,00:31:46.33,00:31:46.33,(man singing) >> I'm so happy right now.
487,00:31:55.04,00:31:55.04,">> You know, today's experience was one of the top five"
488,00:31:57.12,00:31:57.12,experiences of my life. I was touched and overwhelmed in
489,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,so many different ways. Right when the darkness is
490,00:32:03.83,00:32:03.83,"coming, there's this beautiful dawn, and there's this beautiful"
491,00:32:06.67,00:32:06.67,bonding experience. We got to feast.
492,00:32:09.25,00:32:09.25,We got to hang out. All the stuff that had gone on
493,00:32:12.04,00:32:12.04,the night before got... sort of got washed away with the
494,00:32:14.25,00:32:14.25,"victory. It was a really, really great"
495,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,day. (birds singing)
496,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,>> You know what the saddest part is?
497,00:32:33.17,00:32:33.17,We knew where the first piece went.
498,00:32:35.08,00:32:35.08,We had it figured out. We knew right where it went.
499,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,"We went in, and we laid it down there, and it wouldn't fit."
500,00:32:40.46,00:32:40.46,>> That was the key to the whole puzzle.
501,00:32:42.58,00:32:42.58,>> Losing the immunity challenge was bad.
502,00:32:44.58,00:32:44.58,"It was... it was game seven for us, and we lost it."
503,00:32:46.79,00:32:46.79,"Now Sally's got immunity from Tribal Council tonight, and, uh,"
504,00:32:50.12,00:32:50.12,we've got to vote off one of our guys.
505,00:32:52.58,00:32:52.58,>> How can we lose a challenge with a puzzle when we have a
506,00:32:55.25,00:32:55.25,"NASA engineer on our team? I mean, how do you do that?"
507,00:32:58.58,00:32:58.58,>> I don't know. >> This is a young people's
508,00:33:01.12,00:33:01.12,"game right now. You know, we can take you a lot"
509,00:33:03.12,00:33:03.12,further in this... >> Right.
510,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,">> ...than he can. >> If Sally was here, obviously,"
511,00:33:08.04,00:33:08.04,"we'd take her, but, you know, physically, he's the weakest."
512,00:33:11.79,00:33:11.79,>> The four of us are all very close and have an incredibly
513,00:33:14.79,00:33:14.79,"strong bond, and I know that this has to be incredibly"
514,00:33:17.67,00:33:17.67,"difficult on Terry to even consider eliminating Dan, but"
515,00:33:22.17,00:33:22.17,"somebody has to go home, and I don't want it to be me."
516,00:33:26.83,00:33:26.83,>> I had it. Sitting in that very spot was
517,00:33:29.12,00:33:29.12,"the answer. You know, the center piece can't"
518,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,"rotate now. It cannot fit, and to..."
519,00:33:35.33,00:33:35.33,"I'll never know why... >> Well, no use pondering"
520,00:33:38.12,00:33:38.12,it anymore. >> It's true.
521,00:33:45.54,00:33:45.54,It's going to be... We're going to have to sort that
522,00:33:47.54,00:33:47.54,"out, 'cause two v. two gets kind of sketchy."
523,00:33:49.54,00:33:49.54,>> Do you think Austin is interested in leaving?
524,00:33:54.21,00:33:54.21,">> I don't think so, but I... I can ask him, but I-I really"
525,00:33:57.25,00:33:57.25,doubt it. >> I ain't going against Terry.
526,00:34:01.25,00:34:01.25,">> Yeah, I can't vote against Austin."
527,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,>> I don't know what's going to happen tonight.
528,00:34:05.25,00:34:05.25,It's probably going to be two v. two.
529,00:34:07.38,00:34:07.38,"Uh, Terry and I versus Nick and Austin."
530,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,>> I was talking to Dan. He's pretty convinced it's going
531,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,to be a two v. two tonight. >> Yeah.
532,00:34:17.33,00:34:17.33,I-I-I... He's-He's a friend of mine.
533,00:34:19.96,00:34:19.96,I like him. We have crap loads in common
534,00:34:22.79,00:34:22.79,"with all the flying and everything like that, but I feel"
535,00:34:25.42,00:34:25.42,like I'm putting on my Joe Torre hat and making a decision for
536,00:34:27.38,00:34:27.38,"the strength of the team, and... >> Yeah."
537,00:34:29.88,00:34:29.88,>> ...there's a couple of challenges where he's... not
538,00:34:32.46,00:34:32.46,come through. >> Yeah.
539,00:34:34.83,00:34:34.83,">> It could have been us, but it wasn't."
540,00:34:37.42,00:34:37.42,"It was... It was him, so..."
541,00:34:39.42,00:34:39.42,>> Yeah. >> I should probably talk to
542,00:34:42.75,00:34:42.75,him. I think that the remaining three
543,00:34:45.12,00:34:45.12,"strongest men would be me, Nick and Austin."
544,00:34:47.88,00:34:47.88,"Dan's odd man out. And I feel bad, but"
545,00:34:50.33,00:34:50.33,that's-that's the way it is. >> My whole job is about having
546,00:34:55.04,00:34:55.04,"a game plan in place, and if it's not quite working out,"
547,00:34:59.21,00:34:59.21,"stepping back, and I didn't do that."
548,00:35:01.46,00:35:01.46,"Instead, I picked up the puzzle piece and started looking"
549,00:35:03.54,00:35:03.54,around randomly. And you know what?
550,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,"If I did that in space, you die. >> You know, we-we made a pact"
551,00:35:12.83,00:35:12.83,not to lie to one another and tell each other the truth and
552,00:35:14.88,00:35:14.88,stuff. >> Right. Absolutely.
553,00:35:16.79,00:35:16.79,">> And, uh, you know what? If..."
554,00:35:18.96,00:35:18.96,"I'd take you to the final two with you and me if I could,"
555,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,"so, um... I-I feel like I'm making the"
556,00:35:24.79,00:35:24.79,decision for the strength of the team tonight.
557,00:35:27.04,00:35:27.04,>> I hate leaving. I hate leaving.
558,00:35:29.04,00:35:29.04,>> I definitely... I wanted to talk to you first.
559,00:35:31.04,00:35:31.04,I didn't want to make it a surprise.
560,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,">> Hey, you know, my fault. My bad."
561,00:35:39.08,00:35:39.08,I got to take responsibility for that.
562,00:35:41.67,00:35:41.67,"And as much as I, you know, would, you know, love to stay--"
563,00:35:44.71,00:35:44.71,"I want to be here-- hey, you screw up, you got to... you"
564,00:35:49.33,00:35:49.33,"know, you got to take the hit. >> Dan and I have something even"
565,00:35:53.08,00:35:53.08,more in common than anybody else-- soaring to all kinds of
566,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,heights above the Earth-- and having to vote him off is a
567,00:35:58.50,00:35:58.50,"highly emotional decision, because he's something else."
568,00:36:03.58,00:36:03.58,Dan has the right stuff. >> PROBST: Welcome back to
569,00:36:28.79,00:36:28.79,Tribal Council. Let's start by talking about who
570,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,"is not here. Austin, how big a part of this"
571,00:36:35.92,00:36:35.92,"tribe is Sally? >> She's a huge part, but you"
572,00:36:39.04,00:36:39.04,"know, we had the boys' club and Sally, um, but she was saved by"
573,00:36:42.71,00:36:42.71,"the move that, um, Casaya made today."
574,00:36:45.88,00:36:45.88,">> PROBST: So, Nick, it was going to be Sally, the next"
575,00:36:47.75,00:36:47.75,"out? >> Yeah, Sally would have been"
576,00:36:49.54,00:36:49.54,"next. >> PROBST: Terry, do you think"
577,00:36:51.58,00:36:51.58,Casaya knew that? Sensed that?
578,00:36:53.46,00:36:53.46,>> It was immediately known that they were going to pick Sally.
579,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,That meant that we four guys had to vote one of us out.
580,00:36:59.62,00:36:59.62,"So, a maybe stronger player is now going to be leaving the"
581,00:37:02.25,00:37:02.25,"game, versus having Sally in there, so it was a smart"
582,00:37:05.71,00:37:05.71,"strategic move by their point, big time."
583,00:37:08.29,00:37:08.29,">> PROBST: Nick, how tight is this group?"
584,00:37:10.75,00:37:10.75,Because it's about to be splintered.
585,00:37:12.75,00:37:12.75,">> The group's amazingly tight. I mean, we were able to talk"
586,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,openly tonight. It's not a surprise to who's
587,00:37:17.96,00:37:17.96,"going to be leaving tonight. It's understood that, you know,"
588,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,"when you're part of a team, you might be the weaker physical,"
589,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,you might be the weaker mental-- whatever your role is-- and we
590,00:37:25.25,00:37:25.25,accept that. So it's-it's been a very
591,00:37:28.79,00:37:28.79,"businesslike process tonight. >> PROBST: Well, I'm looking at"
592,00:37:31.12,00:37:31.12,"the four of you, and so far, nobody's face is giving anything"
593,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,"away. I don't know if it's you,"
594,00:37:34.88,00:37:34.88,"Austin, Terry or Dan. >> It's me."
595,00:37:37.62,00:37:37.62,"Uh, they were very up-front with me to tell me that, uh, it's my"
596,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"turn tonight to go, and today, three people performed their"
597,00:37:45.04,00:37:45.04,"job, and two people didn't. And one of those two people is"
598,00:37:48.71,00:37:48.71,"immune, and the other one is sitting right here."
599,00:37:51.71,00:37:51.71,And I'm willing to take responsibility.
600,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,"At the same time, I'd be lying if I didn't say I was kind of"
601,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,"hoping, uh, that it was going to go maybe a two v. two."
602,00:38:00.25,00:38:00.25,>> PROBST: Meaning a tie between...
603,00:38:02.04,00:38:02.04,">> A tie, you know, and Terry and I go one way, and, uh, Nick"
604,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,"and Austin go the other way. >> PROBST: Terry, there's an"
605,00:38:06.88,00:38:06.88,obvious two versus two scenario. Did that go through your head
606,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,"at any point? >> Strategically, we weren't"
607,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,"going to have to do this till we got to the final four, and"
608,00:38:14.54,00:38:14.54,"now we're the final four of this tribe, and what I'm doing is,"
609,00:38:18.38,00:38:18.38,"uh, making a managerial decision."
610,00:38:20.38,00:38:20.38,">> PROBST: Austin, was it clear in your mind that there was one"
611,00:38:23.83,00:38:23.83,person who just needed to go? They're holding us back.
612,00:38:27.75,00:38:27.75,>> I would never use those words to say about my buddy Dan Berry.
613,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,There's nothing about him that needs to go.
614,00:38:34.04,00:38:34.04,We are just down to a situation where somebody has to go.
615,00:38:36.96,00:38:36.96,Dan was the weakest of the four of us.
616,00:38:39.96,00:38:39.96,">> PROBST: Dan, what will this tribe be losing if you go home"
617,00:38:42.54,00:38:42.54,tonight? >> I do a lot around the camp.
618,00:38:45.21,00:38:45.21,"I built the fire shelter. I built the, uh, fireplace."
619,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,"Uh, Dan Fuego-- I-I take care of that part."
620,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,"Um, I'm pretty good in the water, and in general, I'm a"
621,00:38:54.42,00:38:54.42,great puzzle solver. I don't know what happened
622,00:38:57.00,00:38:57.00,today. But they are losing a
623,00:38:59.08,00:38:59.08,"substantial contributor. >> PROBST: So, Dan, are you just"
624,00:39:02.08,00:39:02.08,"taking the sword on this one? >> No, I'm not."
625,00:39:05.08,00:39:05.08,"Absolutely not. If it was my choice, this would"
626,00:39:07.79,00:39:07.79,"go two v. two, and we'd have a little challenge going on"
627,00:39:09.96,00:39:09.96,here. I expected to last a lot longer
628,00:39:11.96,00:39:11.96,"than this. And in fact, yesterday, I"
629,00:39:14.50,00:39:14.50,thought I was lasting a lot longer.
630,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,"You know, I'm-I'm solid with five people."
631,00:39:19.04,00:39:19.04,"I know there's one person in front of me, for sure, if we"
632,00:39:21.04,00:39:21.04,were to lose again. It's just... it's incredible how
633,00:39:24.08,00:39:24.08,"fast things turn. >> PROBST: Okay, so it does seem"
634,00:39:27.08,00:39:27.08,"like tonight's vote is a bit of a foregone conclusion, but I've"
635,00:39:30.17,00:39:30.17,"seen weirder things happen. Well, Terry, you have been to"
636,00:39:34.71,00:39:34.71,Exile Island. The immunity idol could come
637,00:39:36.75,00:39:36.75,into play. You'll let me know after the
638,00:39:38.62,00:39:38.62,vote if that is indeed the case. It is time to vote.
639,00:39:41.12,00:39:41.12,"Nick, you're up. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
640,00:40:13.00,00:40:13.00,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
641,00:40:24.75,00:40:24.75,decision is final. The person voted out will be
642,00:40:26.54,00:40:26.54,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
643,00:40:28.54,00:40:28.54,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Dan."
644,00:40:38.00,00:40:38.00,Austin. Dan.
645,00:40:44.50,00:40:44.50,"That's two votes Dan, one vote Austin, one vote left."
646,00:40:51.21,00:40:51.21,"Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Exile Island, Dan."
647,00:40:54.50,00:40:54.50,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Good luck, my boys."
648,00:40:57.50,00:40:57.50,"(indistinct chatter) >> PROBST: Dan, the tribe has"
649,00:41:07.00,00:41:07.00,spoken. Time to go.
650,00:41:11.96,00:41:11.96,">> See you, Dan-o. >> See you, Dan."
651,00:41:23.33,00:41:23.33,>> PROBST: Seemed like a tough vote.
652,00:41:25.54,00:41:25.54,"Probably won't be your last. Grab your torches, head back to"
653,00:41:28.12,00:41:28.12,camp. Good night.

655,00:41:39.67,00:41:39.67,access.wgbh.org >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
656,00:41:44.46,00:41:44.46,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
657,00:41:49.21,00:41:49.21,Survivor: New blood changes everything.
658,00:41:51.04,00:41:51.04,">> There they are. >> Hey, come here quickly."
659,00:41:53.08,00:41:53.08,">> We're home, baby. I'm ready to get in there, see"
660,00:41:55.12,00:41:55.12,"if I can come out victorious. >> You come over, and we will go"
661,00:41:57.17,00:41:57.17,to the final five. >> PROBST: Terry wheels and
662,00:41:59.17,00:41:59.17,deals. >> I'm just looking for two
663,00:42:00.71,00:42:00.71,people to swing the total game our way.
664,00:42:02.42,00:42:02.42,>> PROBST: And Bruce gets whacked.
665,00:42:04.42,00:42:04.42,>> You know what? >> I just hit Bruce in the face
666,00:42:06.04,00:42:06.04,with a machete. I'm out of here.
667,00:42:13.50,00:42:13.50,>> I was a little surprised by Terry's decision.
668,00:42:15.75,00:42:15.75,"I would never have voted for Terry, but he's got to play his"
669,00:42:18.00,00:42:18.00,game. I know that you did what you
670,00:42:20.00,00:42:20.00,"felt you had to do. I respect that, and I wish them"
671,00:42:22.08,00:42:22.08,all the best. This was a wonderful adventure.
672,00:42:25.58,00:42:25.58,"I loved every day out here, and the only thing I really have to"
673,00:42:28.21,00:42:28.21,"say is, thank you to my family for letting Dad go off on"
674,00:42:31.04,00:42:31.04,another crazy adventure.
