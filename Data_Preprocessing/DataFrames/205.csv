2,00:00:03.77,00:00:03.77,"Survivor, Keith and Tina plotted to take down Jerri."
3,00:00:06.90,00:00:06.90,">> TINA: She's the most bossy, domineering person I've ever"
4,00:00:08.47,00:00:08.47,met. >> KEITH: I didn't come out here
5,00:00:10.80,00:00:10.80,to be pushed around by a bartender-wannabe-actress.
6,00:00:12.67,00:00:12.67,>> JEFF: Jerri persuaded Colby to make a deal.
7,00:00:14.67,00:00:14.67,">> COLBY: It's me, you and Amber, through to the end."
8,00:00:17.10,00:00:17.10,>> JERRI: It's not like you're making a deal with the devil
9,00:00:18.63,00:00:18.63,here. >> COLBY: I simply agreed to go
10,00:00:21.17,00:00:21.17,along with them to get me down the road a little better.
11,00:00:23.33,00:00:23.33,>> JEFF: Kimmi's morals were compromised when the tribe won
12,00:00:25.67,00:00:25.67,"chickens in a reward challenge. >> KIMMI: Don't break her wings,"
13,00:00:27.17,00:00:27.17,"though. Can't they give us some edamame,"
14,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,some tofu...? >> JEFF: Michael shocked his
15,00:00:32.13,00:00:32.13,tribe by killing a pig. >> KIMMI: We live in a sick
16,00:00:33.43,00:00:33.43,tribe. >> ELISABETH: We're going to get
17,00:00:34.97,00:00:34.97,strong now. >> JEFF: Kucha continued their
18,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,"winning streak by taking the immunity challenge, sending"
19,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53,"Ogakor back to Tribal Council for the third consecutive time,"
20,00:00:43.53,00:00:43.53,where the vote was deadlocked in a double tie between Keith and
21,00:00:45.30,00:00:45.30,Mitchell. One vote is the difference.
22,00:00:48.63,00:00:48.63,"But ultimately it was Mitchell who was voted out, putting a"
23,00:00:52.40,00:00:52.40,dent in Jerri's hopes for an alliance.
24,00:00:54.20,00:00:54.20,12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
25,00:01:59.70,00:01:59.70,( birds chirping ) >> COLBY: We really started
26,00:02:19.17,00:02:19.17,noticing the smoke and hearing the trees explode and crash.
27,00:02:23.73,00:02:23.73,"Uh, yesterday, I guess, is when it got the closest to us."
28,00:02:28.10,00:02:28.10,And now we're just completely pretty much overtaken by smoke.
29,00:02:32.83,00:02:32.83,>> AMBER: My eyes are watering. >> TINA: It's just extremely
30,00:02:37.37,00:02:37.37,"hazy and smoky, and... It's an interesting morning."
31,00:02:42.13,00:02:42.13,">> AMBER: We've had an interesting past couple of days,"
32,00:02:45.70,00:02:45.70,"as far as, uh... Let's see, our last Tribal"
33,00:02:48.80,00:02:48.80,"Council we lost Mitchell, which was a surprise."
34,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70,>> JERRI: It was a pretty... pretty traumatic evening.
35,00:02:57.47,00:02:57.47,I think our little group of common voters has been busted
36,00:03:00.20,00:03:00.20,up. It's a whole new ball game right
37,00:03:03.27,00:03:03.27,now. >> KEITH: Love this game.
38,00:03:11.03,00:03:11.03,>> JERRI ( half-whispering ): Tina and Keith are definitely
39,00:03:14.20,00:03:14.20,"grouped together, but Colby is like the one in the middle,"
40,00:03:16.07,00:03:16.07,like... >> AMBER: They're totally
41,00:03:18.83,00:03:18.83,grouping together. >> JERRI: Everybody else is
42,00:03:21.70,00:03:21.70,"trying to pair up, or they're trying..."
43,00:03:23.47,00:03:23.47,We're all vying for Colby's vote.
44,00:03:25.03,00:03:25.03,">> COLBY: I'm playing from the center, dude."
45,00:03:27.03,00:03:27.03,I'm playing from... ( Keith laughing )
46,00:03:29.77,00:03:29.77,Let's squash this one. >> AMBER: Seems like since Tina
47,00:03:33.93,00:03:33.93,was able to get Colby to sway his vote last time and vote for
48,00:03:38.00,00:03:38.00,"Mitchell, seems like maybe he, uh, might sway again to their"
49,00:03:40.20,00:03:40.20,side. But we're almost kind of
50,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,fighting over him. >> COLBY: What we did was
51,00:03:46.70,00:03:46.70,"strategic, and it was to help the team out, and I know it did"
52,00:03:48.80,00:03:48.80,"that. >> JERRI: I have, you know..."
53,00:03:52.67,00:03:52.67,I'm not harboring any ill feelings whatsoever about the
54,00:03:54.67,00:03:54.67,whole deal. We still are more powerful if
55,00:03:59.00,00:03:59.00,the three of us are voting the same.
56,00:04:01.37,00:04:01.37,">> COLBY: I'm still voting just like I did last night, based on"
57,00:04:04.47,00:04:04.47,who the strongest... who I think's got what it takes to
58,00:04:06.13,00:04:06.13,"make it in. Maybe tomorrow, I might be"
59,00:04:09.20,00:04:09.20,"thinking a whole lot different, but... right now I'm not."
60,00:04:12.13,00:04:12.13,">> JERRI: I mean, it's basically the end of any alliance, pretty"
61,00:04:13.93,00:04:13.93,"much. >> COLBY: Jerri, I don't care."
62,00:04:17.37,00:04:17.37,I don't care about that stage of it.
63,00:04:19.07,00:04:19.07,"I mean, all I care about is doing everything we can to win"
64,00:04:22.50,00:04:22.50,the next two immunity challenges.
65,00:04:24.07,00:04:24.07,That's the only thing I can focus on right now.
66,00:04:40.07,00:04:40.07,">> KIMMI: Good morning, stinkies."
67,00:04:43.67,00:04:43.67,"We gotta clean you out, 'cause you all stink."
68,00:04:45.47,00:04:45.47,Last night was a very uncomfortable sleeping night.
69,00:04:48.20,00:04:48.20,"It was drafty, it was cold. Nobody slept last night."
70,00:04:50.90,00:04:50.90,"Like, it was just like one of those nights where anything and"
71,00:04:54.30,00:04:54.30,everything that could wake you up did.
72,00:04:56.03,00:04:56.03,">> JEFF V.: I woke up once, and there was a hot coal on my"
73,00:04:57.93,00:04:57.93,shirt-- look. >> RODGER: You're kidding?
74,00:05:00.77,00:05:00.77,>> JEFF V.: And there was a little fire in my wooly.
75,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,">> NICK: Whew! >> ALICIA: ""Fire in my woolly."""
76,00:05:05.00,00:05:05.00,That's not the first time I heard that.
77,00:05:06.23,00:05:06.23,"Well, how the hell did it bypass everybody else in front"
78,00:05:07.57,00:05:07.57,"of you? >> JEFF V.: I don't know, but if"
79,00:05:10.17,00:05:10.17,"it came all the way back here, it could have landed on your"
80,00:05:11.57,00:05:11.57,face. >> MICHAEL: That's exactly
81,00:05:12.90,00:05:12.90,right. >> JEFF V.: Know what I'm
82,00:05:14.20,00:05:14.20,saying? >> ALICIA: That's not funny.
83,00:05:16.30,00:05:16.30,>> JEFF V.: It's not funny. The fire had been popping coals
84,00:05:19.97,00:05:19.97,out of the fire onto us. >> ALICIA: Wow.
85,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,">> JEFF V.: So, we had to move our fire this morning."
86,00:05:26.37,00:05:26.37,It just was getting a little too dangerous.
87,00:05:42.27,00:05:42.27,>> KIMMI: Very good chickens. They're very happy now.
88,00:05:52.07,00:05:52.07,"Hello, hello... >> JEFF V.: We got fire!"
89,00:05:59.03,00:05:59.03,">> RODGER: It was a little inconvenient right there, you"
90,00:06:01.87,00:06:01.87,"know, but boy, late at night, nighttime, be..."
91,00:06:04.37,00:06:04.37,Gonna be different around there when it gets cold at night.
92,00:06:07.50,00:06:07.50,I guess we're ready to go. Chicken killing time.
93,00:06:10.30,00:06:10.30,">> ALICIA: You know what, though?"
94,00:06:12.10,00:06:12.10,That hatchet needs to be sharpened.
95,00:06:13.70,00:06:13.70,"It's pretty dull again. >> RODGER: Mike got the pig,"
96,00:06:18.20,00:06:18.20,"and, uh, we ate real good. We wasn't able to save all the"
97,00:06:21.90,00:06:21.90,"meat, so I guess we're going to eat chicken."
98,00:06:24.07,00:06:24.07,"So, we won't have the eggs. ( scraping continues )"
99,00:06:27.07,00:06:27.07,Sharp as possible while we're... while we're doing the chicken
100,00:06:29.10,00:06:29.10,"in. >> KIMMI: Hello, ladies."
101,00:06:34.80,00:06:34.80,"I have such brilliant hens over here, yes..."
102,00:06:37.20,00:06:37.20,">> MICHAEL: I just tell Kimmi, ""For your own self-preservation,"
103,00:06:40.53,00:06:40.53,"let go of the chicken thing. Stop talking about them, stop"
104,00:06:43.60,00:06:43.60,"getting involved..."" >> KIMMI: What's going over"
105,00:06:47.23,00:06:47.23,">> NICK: We're building a fire to boil water, to kill the"
106,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83,chicken. ( clucking )
107,00:06:51.70,00:06:51.70,">> KIMMI: Well, that's my cue. >> MICHAEL: Yeah, we're ready."
108,00:06:54.23,00:06:54.23,">> KIMMI: See you later, bye. >> MICHAEL: Stop making a big"
109,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,"spectacle when you leave. ""Oh, you're butchering the"
110,00:06:59.57,00:06:59.57,"chickens, I'm out of here!"" Da-da-da-da-da!"
111,00:07:02.47,00:07:02.47,"You know, I mean, it's just... It's too theatrical, it's just"
112,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,"too much. >> KIMMI: Bye, chickies,"
113,00:07:08.83,00:07:08.83,bye-bye. >> MICHAEL: I'm ready.
114,00:07:16.83,00:07:16.83,I'm feeling the need to shed some blood.
115,00:07:20.10,00:07:20.10,>> ALICIA: Whatever. ( indistinct voices )
116,00:07:25.00,00:07:25.00,">> RODGER: I don't... I don't, I don't enjoy killing animals,"
117,00:07:26.80,00:07:26.80,neither. >> ELISABETH: Sure.
118,00:07:29.33,00:07:29.33,">> RODGER: I don't, really, but sometimes, nobody wants to do"
119,00:07:31.07,00:07:31.07,"it. Jeff, you want to do it?"
120,00:07:33.63,00:07:33.63,>> MICHAEL: I thought Jeff wanted to do it.
121,00:07:35.83,00:07:35.83,>> ELISABETH: Maybe next time. >> RODGER: You got it?
122,00:07:39.23,00:07:39.23,"( pounding, moaning ) >> ELISABETH: I like that."
123,00:07:48.37,00:07:48.37,"Get these feathers off. >> JEFF V.: Oh, they're hot."
124,00:07:51.27,00:07:51.27,">> RODGER: Yeah, this is by far the right..."
125,00:07:53.27,00:07:53.27,>> ELISABETH: Good stuff. That chicken's going to be so
126,00:08:05.10,00:08:05.10,awesome... >> ALICIA: It's gonna be so
127,00:08:06.67,00:08:06.67,good. ( indistinct voices )
128,00:08:27.97,00:08:27.97,>> AMBER: Thank you. >> KEITH: You're welcome.
129,00:08:30.20,00:08:30.20,>> AMBER: The food situation could definitely be better.
130,00:08:32.60,00:08:32.60,It could always get better. We're not eating that much at
131,00:08:34.07,00:08:34.07,all. We're definitely not eating as
132,00:08:36.67,00:08:36.67,much as the other tribe is. >> JERRI: When you come to see
133,00:08:39.73,00:08:39.73,"me, we have to go somewhere and get a really good pizza."
134,00:08:42.27,00:08:42.27,>> AMBER: Okay. >> JERRI: And lots of garlic and
135,00:08:44.20,00:08:44.20,"bread... We haven't caught any fish for,"
136,00:08:49.00,00:08:49.00,"I think, two days now. The whole hunger thing, that for"
137,00:08:53.07,00:08:53.07,"me has been a huge hurdle. Keith, did you disassemble some"
138,00:08:58.07,00:08:58.07,of these for the line the other night?
139,00:09:00.33,00:09:00.33,The only ones that are rigged to go are the cricket and the
140,00:09:02.63,00:09:02.63,silver one. >> KEITH: Jerri went to go
141,00:09:06.90,00:09:06.90,"fishing, and she needed the can. And of course, she hollered out"
142,00:09:09.87,00:09:09.87,"to me, like her older sibling. >> JERRI: What do you suggest we"
143,00:09:12.70,00:09:12.70,do with the fish guts? >> KEITH: I said we'll take them
144,00:09:15.43,00:09:15.43,"to the end and dump them in the water, like we've been doing it."
145,00:09:19.03,00:09:19.03,"And so, she brought them down to the water's edge down at the end"
146,00:09:21.77,00:09:21.77,"of camp to dump them out, and then she yelled back that it's"
147,00:09:24.47,00:09:24.47,"not a smart idea to dump them in there, because..."
148,00:09:26.80,00:09:26.80,>> JERRI: We're literally feeding the fish every time we
149,00:09:29.30,00:09:29.30,"dump the guts down there. >> KEITH: Well, my vote is you"
150,00:09:31.93,00:09:31.93,just bury them in the sand down by the end down there.
151,00:09:34.33,00:09:34.33,">> JERRI: The thing is, it's also downwind from us, so once"
152,00:09:37.07,00:09:37.07,"they start rotting, if by chance you get a second, if you want"
153,00:09:38.70,00:09:38.70,to... >> KEITH: I'll bury them.
154,00:09:40.93,00:09:40.93,>> JERRI: Yeah? >> KEITH: No problem.
155,00:09:43.00,00:09:43.00,>> JERRI: That would be really cool.
156,00:09:44.37,00:09:44.37,>> KEITH: It's all right. I'm thinking on these couple
157,00:09:51.97,00:09:51.97,"hundred acres of water, I'm not sure that a few fish eating some"
158,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,"dead fish is going to matter a whole lot, but whatever."
159,00:09:59.77,00:09:59.77,>> JERRI: It's just ridiculous to me to continue to dump the
160,00:10:03.73,00:10:03.73,guts at the end of our beach. We're literally feeding the
161,00:10:06.77,00:10:06.77,fish. It's no wonder we haven't been
162,00:10:10.30,00:10:10.30,"able to catch anything, they're all full."
163,00:10:12.27,00:10:12.27,">> KEITH: It's not that big of a deal, but apparently..."
164,00:10:17.40,00:10:17.40,it was. I don't stand up to her that
165,00:10:20.03,00:10:20.03,"often, 'cause I don't find it necessary, 'cause it's more"
166,00:10:22.60,00:10:22.60,exhausting to argue with her than anything.
167,00:10:25.07,00:10:25.07,The fish... are now... buried. Dead fish.
168,00:10:34.50,00:10:34.50,">> JERRI: We haven't been catching fish again, and the"
169,00:10:37.40,00:10:37.40,"other team is eating chickens and pigs and eggs, you know."
170,00:10:40.43,00:10:40.43,"And here we are over here, starving to death."
171,00:10:44.87,00:10:44.87,>> KEITH: You have any? >> JERRI: No luck.
172,00:10:48.20,00:10:48.20,Those are the things that I didn't really think going into
173,00:10:51.97,00:10:51.97,this that were going to bother me.
174,00:10:53.57,00:10:53.57,But it has. >> KIMMI: ...something really
175,00:10:58.37,00:10:58.37,"different. >> ALICIA: No, no, I didn't get"
176,00:11:01.03,00:11:01.03,"upset about you; I left. >> KIMMI: No, my point is, is"
177,00:11:03.43,00:11:03.43,"that with the, uh, chicken, I'm just saying for these guys to"
178,00:11:06.03,00:11:06.03,"stay stronger, it's better to, like, do every other day,"
179,00:11:08.37,00:11:08.37,putting meat in their body. >> ALICIA: You gotta be kidding?
180,00:11:10.60,00:11:10.60,>> KIMMI: I don't know. >> ALICIA: We're active every
181,00:11:12.50,00:11:12.50,"day, we need protein every day. >> KIMMI: No, my points is..."
182,00:11:14.53,00:11:14.53,">> ALICIA: That's not a good argument, it's not gonna work."
183,00:11:16.50,00:11:16.50,>> KIMMI: This isn't like a debate to be arguing about.

366,00:19:12.30,00:19:12.30,we're facing a tribe just as strong as we are.
367,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,>> AMBER: Who's gonna decide do we want to make it like a

370,00:19:24.27,00:19:24.27,weave it just follow-follow me with this.
371,00:19:25.93,00:19:25.93,>> COLBY: We're dragging this thing.
372,00:19:27.00,00:19:27.00,We want the least amount of friction we can get.
373,00:19:29.03,00:19:29.03,">> JERRI: Okay, so what's your point?"
374,00:19:30.03,00:19:30.03,What's wrong with this? >> COLBY: I'm saying...

376,00:19:33.90,00:19:33.90,">> COLBY: Exactly, and I think it's great."
377,00:19:35.53,00:19:35.53,"I'm saying instead of starting it over the top, start it"
378,00:19:36.80,00:19:36.80,underneath. >> AMBER: From underneath.
379,00:19:39.00,00:19:39.00,>> COLBY: You see what I'm saying?
380,00:19:40.10,00:19:40.10,">> KEITH: We got two pieces... >> JERRI: No, I don't see what"
381,00:19:41.60,00:19:41.60,"you're saying. You guys want to, like, put her"
382,00:19:44.07,00:19:44.07,in it and pick it up-- the four of us-- just to see what
383,00:19:45.40,00:19:45.40,happens? I got kind of tickled when
384,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,making the travois. I knew that the idea I had would
385,00:19:57.07,00:19:57.07,"work, and everybody was just kind of standing around and"
386,00:19:58.87,00:19:58.87,talking. And no one was doing anything.
387,00:20:02.23,00:20:02.23,So I just kind of grabbed the bull by the horns.
388,00:20:05.63,00:20:05.63,God bless America... this... >> KEITH: I have probably a
389,00:20:10.90,00:20:10.90,little more patience than Colby does.
390,00:20:12.47,00:20:12.47,But I can usually tell when he's getting a little tense and a
391,00:20:15.27,00:20:15.27,"little agitated, you know. He'll walk away from it and just"
392,00:20:17.90,00:20:17.90,"take a breath. >> JERRI: Let's try it this way,"
393,00:20:26.43,00:20:26.43,just in case we're able to. >> AMBER: Is it really bad?

396,00:20:42.03,00:20:42.03,this tribe is coming into these challenges with our guns
397,00:20:44.63,00:20:44.63,"blazing, ready to rock. We gotta win this thing, and we"
398,00:20:47.40,00:20:47.40,"still got a shot at doing it. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys."
399,00:20:58.93,00:20:58.93,"All right, well, we've already established how tough it is"
400,00:21:01.90,00:21:01.90,living in the Outback. You're battling-- among other
401,00:21:04.80,00:21:04.80,"things-- an out of control fire, wildlife, crocodiles, snakes,"
402,00:21:06.70,00:21:06.70,"spiders. If you get hurt, you are a long"
403,00:21:09.83,00:21:09.83,way from help. You have to be able to rely on
404,00:21:12.77,00:21:12.77,your tribe mates to get you back to safety.
405,00:21:14.70,00:21:14.70,That's where today's challenge comes in: triage.
406,00:21:17.13,00:21:17.13,You were asked to build a travois-- a three-sided
407,00:21:18.67,00:21:18.67,stretcher. You're going to use that today.
408,00:21:22.33,00:21:22.33,Two members from each tribe will be the rescuers.
409,00:21:24.63,00:21:24.63,Three members will be the victims.
410,00:21:26.17,00:21:26.17,You'll be placed at three different spots out here on the
411,00:21:29.20,00:21:29.20,river on little sand spits. There's a flag designating the
412,00:21:30.90,00:21:30.90,area. There is a circle around that
413,00:21:32.77,00:21:32.77,flag. The victims will stand inside
414,00:21:35.67,00:21:35.67,"that circle. When the rescuers get out there,"
415,00:21:39.07,00:21:39.07,you get on your travois and you head back.
416,00:21:41.13,00:21:41.13,"Once they cross this line and they're okay, they are"
417,00:21:44.40,00:21:44.40,"miraculously healed, they become a rescuer."
418,00:21:46.33,00:21:46.33,Now you have three. Going for the next person.
419,00:21:49.03,00:21:49.03,First tribe to get all three of their victims back to the first
420,00:21:52.33,00:21:52.33,"aid camp wins reward. Now, Kucha, because you guys"
421,00:21:55.17,00:21:55.17,"have two extra members, two people will sit out."
422,00:21:57.90,00:21:57.90,The winning tribe gets what they wanted and also what the other
423,00:22:01.10,00:22:01.10,tribe wanted. ( all groaning )
424,00:22:03.37,00:22:03.37,">> ELISABETH: Shut up! >> JEFF: So, Kucha, you chose"
425,00:22:06.10,00:22:06.10,"the blankets and the spices. Ogakor, you also chose the"
426,00:22:08.83,00:22:08.83,spaces and the soup mix. >> ALICIA: It's a beautiful
427,00:22:10.33,00:22:10.33,thing. >> JEFF: And Target has thrown
428,00:22:13.27,00:22:13.27,"in a few other items. They're not necessities, these"
429,00:22:14.87,00:22:14.87,are luxuries. Got fresh toothbrush...

437,00:22:33.63,00:22:33.63,Decide on your rescuers and your victims.

439,00:22:42.30,00:22:42.30,"Come on, guys! >> JEFF: Kimmi and Rodger,"
440,00:22:48.10,00:22:48.10,you're sitting out for Kucha. A lot of reward at stake.
441,00:22:51.17,00:22:51.17,"Survivors, ready... Go!"

460,00:25:54.90,00:25:54.90,then it may be a meltdown for the Colbster.

466,00:26:34.30,00:26:34.30,"one more nail in the coffin. Not as important as immunity,"
467,00:26:37.63,00:26:37.63,but another thing that's gonna sink them just a little bit
468,00:26:39.73,00:26:39.73,lower. >> JEFF V.: I don't mean to
469,00:26:42.13,00:26:42.13,"sound evil, but it's all about kicking somebody's ass."
470,00:26:44.70,00:26:44.70,>> ALICIA: There's no way they're gonna give up.
471,00:26:47.17,00:26:47.17,"They were very graceful losers, actually."
472,00:26:50.43,00:26:50.43,I'm just so glad we're not them right now.
473,00:26:52.93,00:26:52.93,That's rough. >> JEFF V.: Some of the people
474,00:26:55.27,00:26:55.27,in the tribe are talking about how guilty they feel and how bad
475,00:26:57.60,00:26:57.60,they feel for the other tribe-- and screw it!
476,00:26:59.83,00:26:59.83,"I mean, chop their heads off, chop their legs off, this is a"
477,00:27:02.37,00:27:02.37,game and I'm ready to beat every one of them.
478,00:27:04.87,00:27:04.87,I'm ready to chop their heads off and their eyeballs out so
479,00:27:07.70,00:27:07.70,Mike can eat them... ( laughter )

487,00:27:30.80,00:27:30.80,so that we can bathe Kimmi. >> MICHAEL: Group bath.
488,00:27:45.27,00:27:45.27,We won the reward challenge yesterday and we used the
489,00:27:48.20,00:27:48.20,"shampoo-- we each got a handful, and we just all soaped up,"
490,00:27:51.37,00:27:51.37,'cause the camp was getting a little stinky.
491,00:27:53.83,00:27:53.83,"Some more than others, because some people bathe more than"
492,00:27:56.67,00:27:56.67,others around here-- but it was fun.

502,00:28:33.67,00:28:33.67,challenge. I honestly think it's our minds
503,00:28:36.53,00:28:36.53,"and our hearts, and if we all believe we can do it."
504,00:28:38.77,00:28:38.77,I definitely think we can. So just make sure that you don't

506,00:28:44.50,00:28:44.50,will get us through it. >> JERRI: There's a lot of
507,00:28:46.80,00:28:46.80,pressure on us today-- a lot. But let's not forget also to
508,00:28:51.83,00:28:51.83,have fun with this. >> COLBY: It is going to take

521,00:29:53.13,00:29:53.13,"pole are these medallions. They're numbered, one, two,"
522,00:29:56.53,00:29:56.53,"three, four, five. Working as a unit, your goal"
523,00:29:59.70,00:29:59.70,"is to get through the maze, collecting the medallions in"
524,00:30:01.23,00:30:01.23,"order. One first, then two, then three."
525,00:30:05.30,00:30:05.30,"If you find five first, don't grab it."

617,00:34:59.77,00:34:59.77,"It's clear-cut who should go, but they stay a little longer"

620,00:35:09.63,00:35:09.63,"most sense right now, because I have personal problems with her."
621,00:35:13.63,00:35:13.63,We just clash. >> RODGER: It could be very
622,00:35:17.57,00:35:17.57,"interesting, Tribal Council. Right now, I assume that they"

626,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,and I think she's the same way towards me.

635,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,"but there might be a little bit more harmony around, too."

639,00:37:05.20,00:37:05.20,>> JEFF: Welcome back. I haven't really had a chance to
640,00:37:08.63,00:37:08.63,talk to you guys since Debb was voted out in the first Tribal
641,00:37:11.40,00:37:11.40,Council. Haven't been back.
642,00:37:13.97,00:37:13.97,"Michael, last time you were here, Rodger sort of, kind of"
643,00:37:17.47,00:37:17.47,confirmed that you were sort of the leader of the group.
644,00:37:20.10,00:37:20.10,"Or you had taken that position. >> MICHAEL: You know, everybody"
645,00:37:23.87,00:37:23.87,"has taken a leadership role in this camp in one way, shape or"
646,00:37:25.60,00:37:25.60,form. It happened to be that food
647,00:37:29.13,00:37:29.13,seemed to be on the top of the charts and I was bringing in
648,00:37:31.57,00:37:31.57,"fish. And so, you know, I possibly was"
649,00:37:35.47,00:37:35.47,anointed the leader by Rodger that day.
650,00:37:38.30,00:37:38.30,But everybody on this team has contributed in their own way in
651,00:37:41.97,00:37:41.97,"equal amount, and that's why we've been so strong."
652,00:37:44.80,00:37:44.80,"( thunder rumbles, rain falls ) >> JEFF: Well, as always, it"
653,00:37:48.00,00:37:48.00,"seems like when you guys are here, we get the rain coming"
654,00:37:49.30,00:37:49.30,down. And there go the caps.
655,00:37:52.47,00:37:52.47,"Alicia, talk to me about leadership, because for me,"
656,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,"looking in, I would say you seem to be a strong leader on this"
657,00:37:58.67,00:37:58.67,tribe as well. >> ALICIA: I don't know about
658,00:38:01.27,00:38:01.27,that. I'm not so sure I'm a leader as
659,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,much as maybe a motivator. I like to make sure that
660,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,everybody is on the same page. I think if we're all on the same
661,00:38:10.73,00:38:10.73,"page, especially going into a challenge, there's no way we're"
662,00:38:12.67,00:38:12.67,going to lose. >> JEFF: What's your biggest
663,00:38:14.83,00:38:14.83,contribution? >> ALICIA: I think my motivation
664,00:38:17.23,00:38:17.23,for everybody is probably my biggest contribution.
665,00:38:19.17,00:38:19.17,I'm used to doing that back home with my job as a personal
666,00:38:22.30,00:38:22.30,"trainer, motivating people, and I think it just comes naturally"
667,00:38:25.40,00:38:25.40,"to me, in any kind of situation, to take on that motivation role."
668,00:38:29.83,00:38:29.83,"And that's what I do, or at least I try to."
669,00:38:32.80,00:38:32.80,">> JEFF: Kimmi, I've seen you in action."

672,00:38:39.80,00:38:39.80,"like with anything, it could depend on the day or the"
673,00:38:43.03,00:38:43.03,"weather, you know, what goes through your head."
674,00:38:46.80,00:38:46.80,"'Cause, every day, you feel close to somebody and then you"
675,00:38:49.47,00:38:49.47,"feel a little bit separated, and it's, um... it's weird."
676,00:38:53.67,00:38:53.67,">> JEFF: All right, guys. Behind me, four torches."
677,00:38:56.67,00:38:56.67,Debb is the only one familiar to you guys and another one is

683,00:40:00.53,00:40:00.53,whole food thing is really becoming an issue that separates
684,00:40:04.20,00:40:04.20,"her from the rest of the tribe, so I think it's time to let her"
685,00:40:06.40,00:40:06.40,go. >> ELISABETH: We need to keep
686,00:40:18.93,00:40:18.93,"our tribe strong and there's too much split going on, so, for"
687,00:40:22.33,00:40:22.33,"a strong Kucha, it's the best vote."
688,00:40:37.03,00:40:37.03,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
689,00:40:50.87,00:40:50.87,"Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final."

700,00:42:01.17,00:42:01.17,you survived Tribal Council. The bad news is: this is what
701,00:42:05.70,00:42:05.70,you get to sleep in. Have a good long walk home.
702,00:42:08.83,00:42:08.83,"Grab your torches, I'll see you tomorrow."

712,00:43:08.17,00:43:08.17,I'm glad that I stayed true to myself and my morals.

714,00:43:13.10,00:43:13.10,one. If that's what they felt that
