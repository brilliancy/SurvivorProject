1,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.00,00:00:03.00," At Chuay Gahn, Ted and Ghandia were no longer"
3,00:00:05.80,00:00:05.80," on speaking terms, following their confrontation."
4,00:00:08.87,00:00:08.87,The relationship betweenGhandia and I
5,00:00:09.83,00:00:09.83, is nonexistent.
6,00:00:10.83,00:00:10.83, I only see five people on this island.
7,00:00:12.67,00:00:12.67,PROBST: Their rift divided the tribe along gender lines.
8,00:00:15.87,00:00:15.87,HELEN: I do believe Ghandia's story.
9,00:00:17.60,00:00:17.60, The guys will believe Ted's side.
10,00:00:19.20,00:00:19.20,PROBST: Stephanie was on the outs with Sook Jai.
11,00:00:21.50,00:00:21.50,STEPHANIE: They got rid of Jed.
12,00:00:22.83,00:00:22.83,Piss on them.
13,00:00:23.90,00:00:23.90,SHII ANN: I don't know what Stephanie's problem is.
14,00:00:25.90,00:00:25.90," Honestly, I think she just feels"
15,00:00:27.23,00:00:27.23,-like we're all idiots.-Go!
16,00:00:29.00,00:00:29.00,"PROBST: At the reward challenge,"
17,00:00:30.47,00:00:30.47, Sook Jai's physical strength
18,00:00:32.17,00:00:32.17, secured them another victory.
19,00:00:34.23,00:00:34.23, Along with it came bananas and chickens.
20,00:00:37.53,00:00:37.53,"We're going to checkfor eggs every day,"
21,00:00:38.87,00:00:38.87,and I expect there to be eggs!
22,00:00:40.60,00:00:40.60,PROBST: Sook Jai also won immunity.
23,00:00:42.37,00:00:42.37,-Sook Jai wins immunity!-Sook Jai!
24,00:00:44.47,00:00:44.47,Yeah!
25,00:00:46.57,00:00:46.57,"PROBST: Back at Chuay Gahn,"
26,00:00:47.93,00:00:47.93, Ghandia wanted the women to vote for Clay.
27,00:00:49.87,00:00:49.87,But here's where I'm thinkingwith this.
28,00:00:51.63,00:00:51.63,"If we keep the girls together,then we have a leverage"
29,00:00:53.93,00:00:53.93,-of a three-to-two vote.-Mm-hmm. All right.
30,00:00:55.83,00:00:55.83,I will be so happy tonightif Clay is gone.
31,00:00:58.03,00:00:58.03,PROBST: But Helen was torn between her loyalty to Ghandia
32,00:01:01.20,00:01:01.20, and her desire to play the game.
33,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63,"HELEN: I want to play, but it would mean"
34,00:01:04.37,00:01:04.37, voting Ghandia off tonight.
35,00:01:05.90,00:01:05.90,"Honestly, right now,I'm still betwixt and between."
36,00:01:09.37,00:01:09.37,"PROBST: In the end, gender lines broke down."
37,00:01:11.60,00:01:11.60," Helen jumped ship, voting Ghandia out of the tribe."
38,00:01:14.17,00:01:14.17,Tribe has spoken.
39,00:01:17.00,00:01:17.00, 12 are left.
40,00:01:18.00,00:01:18.00, Who will be voted out tonight?
41,00:02:33.23,00:02:33.23,"Here, I'll put it backin the same place."
42,00:02:44.03,00:02:44.03,CLAY: We had a very interesting Tribal Council.
43,00:02:47.00,00:02:47.00," Little bit of a shocker. Now, we knew that Jan"
44,00:02:49.27,00:02:49.27," was being manipulated by, uh, Ghandia,"
45,00:02:52.03,00:02:52.03, but we didn't know just... just how much.
46,00:02:54.27,00:02:54.27,Why the helldid she vote for me?
47,00:02:56.23,00:02:56.23,"That, uh, didn't makea whole lot of sense."
48,00:02:59.27,00:02:59.27," Her head's the one that's got the ""X"" on it the next time."
49,00:03:01.93,00:03:01.93, She's the next one to go.
50,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,"JAN: Uh, I voted for Clay."
51,00:03:08.80,00:03:08.80," Clay will know it's me, and he doesn't"
52,00:03:10.67,00:03:10.67,"forgive or forget,so I know I'm next to go."
53,00:03:14.23,00:03:14.23, Helen said she was going
54,00:03:15.53,00:03:15.53," to vote for Clay, but she did not."
55,00:03:17.33,00:03:17.33," It's her vote-- she can choose to change it,"
56,00:03:19.97,00:03:19.97, and I think she changed it.
57,00:03:21.87,00:03:21.87,BRIAN:It's been a long day.
58,00:03:23.43,00:03:23.43,(loud yawning)
59,00:03:24.80,00:03:24.80,HELEN: I know the gir... the girls
60,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23," are gonna think I betrayed them, and I'm just gonna"
61,00:03:28.67,00:03:28.67," have to live with that, but..."
62,00:03:30.23,00:03:30.23, it was... one of those
63,00:03:31.70,00:03:31.70,necessary evils.
64,00:03:32.93,00:03:32.93,"Had to be done,but it wasn't enjoyable to do."
65,00:03:35.30,00:03:35.30,"And, um..."
66,00:03:36.60,00:03:36.60," if that gets me further ahead, then so be it."
67,00:03:49.90,00:03:49.90,(chickens clucking)
68,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,(rooster crowing)
69,00:03:58.03,00:03:58.03,(chickens clucking)
70,00:03:59.87,00:03:59.87,"PENNY: We had already decided that when we woke up,"
71,00:04:02.33,00:04:02.33," as soon as we heard the rooster crow,"
72,00:04:04.30,00:04:04.30, we were gonna get up and we were gonna
73,00:04:06.57,00:04:06.57,"eat, you know, oneof the chickens this morning."
74,00:04:09.03,00:04:09.03,"(chickens clucking, squawking)"
75,00:04:11.47,00:04:11.47,"JAKE: Steph, if you hold it,I'll kill it, okay?"
76,00:04:13.97,00:04:13.97,STEPHANIE:All right.
77,00:04:23.57,00:04:23.57,(cracking)
78,00:04:25.23,00:04:25.23,STEPHANIE:I got up and grabbed him and...
79,00:04:27.67,00:04:27.67,"and held him while Jake, youknow, broke his neck, and then"
80,00:04:30.63,00:04:30.63," we proceeded to, uh, boil the pot of water"
81,00:04:33.13,00:04:33.13, and put him in there to loosen the feathers up
82,00:04:35.03,00:04:35.03, and pluck the feathers out of him...
83,00:04:36.40,00:04:36.40," Then we just boiled him for, like, an hour."
84,00:04:55.57,00:04:55.57,"Mmm, he smells good!"
85,00:04:56.77,00:04:56.77,He smells great.
86,00:04:58.30,00:04:58.30,Everybody come dive in.
87,00:04:59.83,00:04:59.83,"Oh, my gosh."
88,00:05:01.13,00:05:01.13,"Pull a piece off,or however you want to do it."
89,00:05:05.47,00:05:05.47,"JAKE: We thank youfor giving your life,"
90,00:05:07.00,00:05:07.00,"Mr. Bird, but, boy,"
91,00:05:08.43,00:05:08.43,"I tell you what,you sure do taste good."
92,00:05:10.47,00:05:10.47,"Mmm, mmm!"
93,00:05:12.77,00:05:12.77,SHII ANN: It was so tasty.
94,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87," It was probably-- I mean, it was so tough,"
95,00:05:17.00,00:05:17.00," it was like eating leather a little bit,"
96,00:05:19.00,00:05:19.00,but it wasthe best-tasting chicken
97,00:05:20.37,00:05:20.37,I've ever had in my entire life.
98,00:05:22.00,00:05:22.00,"Guys, it doesn't getany better than this."
99,00:05:24.43,00:05:24.43,"SHII ANN:Oh, my God."
100,00:05:26.07,00:05:26.07,Who said they wanted the liver?
101,00:05:27.70,00:05:27.70,I'll eat the heartand the liver.
102,00:05:29.37,00:05:29.37,"ROBB: Shii Ann had a piece, and she ate"
103,00:05:31.20,00:05:31.20, lungs and intestines and necks and picked the bones
104,00:05:34.03,00:05:34.03," so that there's nothing left. I don't know,"
105,00:05:36.27,00:05:36.27,her eating habitsare just repulsive.
106,00:05:44.27,00:05:44.27,This has got to be the best.
107,00:05:45.97,00:05:45.97," She licks her fingers too much,"
108,00:05:47.43,00:05:47.43, then tries... reaches back in and grabs stuff
109,00:05:49.03,00:05:49.03,while everybody else is eating.
110,00:05:50.37,00:05:50.37,She's just gross.
111,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,"Robb, if you wantto try some of the neck,"
112,00:05:53.60,00:05:53.60,there's a lotof meat around it.
113,00:05:54.80,00:05:54.80,Yech!

116,00:06:00.00,00:06:00.00, necks and hearts and gizzards and stuff like that.
117,00:06:03.20,00:06:03.20,Most peopledon't eat that stuff.
118,00:06:04.77,00:06:04.77,"There's a lot more on here,if you guys want to pick at it."
119,00:06:08.17,00:06:08.17," In my family, the heart is..."
120,00:06:10.23,00:06:10.23," it's great eats, you know?"
121,00:06:11.77,00:06:11.77, I grew up partly in Taiwan.
122,00:06:13.23,00:06:13.23," In Taiwan, it's considered a great snack."
123,00:06:16.03,00:06:16.03,-The neck is gone; I ate it.-ROBB: You ate the whole neck?
124,00:06:18.37,00:06:18.37,"Yeah, it was good."
125,00:06:33.40,00:06:33.40,Crabs are very slim.
126,00:06:35.97,00:06:35.97,It's horrible.I don't see 'em running.
127,00:06:37.47,00:06:37.47,"I mean, you don't...you don't even see any."
128,00:06:39.33,00:06:39.33,"I mean, that's, you know,if I could see 'em"
129,00:06:41.40,00:06:41.40,"just running off,at least I'd know there's"
130,00:06:43.07,00:06:43.07,"some out there, but right now Idon't even see any running off."
131,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97,"So, uh, it's very frustrating."

788,00:33:48.73,00:33:48.73,Yes! Yes!
789,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,Chuay Gahn! Yes!
790,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,"-Chuay Gahn, who wants this?-I'll take it."
791,00:33:54.60,00:33:54.60,"PROBST: Chuay Gahn, you guyscan head back to camp."
792,00:33:56.77,00:33:56.77,"Sook Jai, see you guys tonightat Tribal Council."
793,00:33:59.53,00:33:59.53,Somebody's going home.
794,00:34:21.27,00:34:21.27,"SHII ANN: So, who's yourfavorite on the other team?"
795,00:34:24.37,00:34:24.37,When you looked over?
796,00:34:25.73,00:34:25.73,-They all seem really nice.-Don't they?
797,00:34:27.97,00:34:27.97,STEPHANIE: When we had the 60 seconds
798,00:34:29.80,00:34:29.80, of silence where we could decide
799,00:34:31.30,00:34:31.30," whether we wanted to jump tribes, I wish I had."
800,00:34:33.67,00:34:33.67,"I would have a better chanceover there,"
801,00:34:35.33,00:34:35.33,and I think that I would havemore fun over there.
802,00:34:37.73,00:34:37.73,I really do.
803,00:34:39.17,00:34:39.17, Everybody is kind of
804,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57," pretty much blah around here,  and I pretty much"
805,00:34:42.50,00:34:42.50, feel as like they're out to get me.
806,00:34:44.57,00:34:44.57," I could be wrong, but I feel like I'm next."
807,00:34:53.20,00:34:53.20,ERIN: Things are going pretty well.
808,00:34:55.37,00:34:55.37, The only kind of dysfunction we have going on right now
809,00:34:59.03,00:34:59.03, is with Shii Ann.
810,00:35:01.43,00:35:01.43, And I don't even think she really knows that
811,00:35:03.73,00:35:03.73,we even really have that much ofa dysfunction going on with her.
812,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,ERIN:I can't believe it.
813,00:35:08.47,00:35:08.47,She doesn't use her head.She doesn't think.
814,00:35:10.47,00:35:10.47,"ROBB: The most upsetting thingabout it is, like,"
815,00:35:12.40,00:35:12.40,"at the reward we had utensils,and she was using her fingers."
816,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,It's just disgusting.
817,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,"Like, all of us have enoughmanners not to do that."
818,00:35:17.87,00:35:17.87,"ROBB:It's appalling, dude."
819,00:35:19.27,00:35:19.27,"She's a girl, too."
820,00:35:20.43,00:35:20.43,"-Give me a break, dude.-I know."
821,00:35:21.87,00:35:21.87,Who the hell wouldtake her home?
822,00:35:23.27,00:35:23.27,JAKE: I don't know what it is that
823,00:35:24.87,00:35:24.87,"Shii Ann doesthat irritates other people,"
824,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,but it's something.
825,00:35:28.30,00:35:28.30,"ROBB: It's funny 'cause Ken saysshe's a city girl,"
826,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,and they're all like her.
827,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,I don't ever want to meetanother New York City girl.
828,00:35:33.60,00:35:33.60,"ERIN: Oh, God, me, neither.She just bugs me so much."
829,00:35:35.33,00:35:35.33,I can't wait to get rid of her.
830,00:35:36.97,00:35:36.97,"JAKE: She doesn't irritate me, and the reason"
831,00:35:38.70,00:35:38.70," she doesn't irritate me is because she works,"
832,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,and Shii Ann to me is just one
833,00:35:42.23,00:35:42.23,of the all-time good onesas far as that goes.
834,00:35:44.83,00:35:44.83,"We've had one hellof an experience,"
835,00:35:46.50,00:35:46.50,and we got a lot more daysto go.
836,00:35:48.97,00:35:48.97,-This is a third of the waythrough it. -Yup.
837,00:35:51.43,00:35:51.43,So you can't letyour dauber get down.
838,00:35:53.30,00:35:53.30,You just have to keep going.
839,00:35:54.83,00:35:54.83,And when people look like
840,00:35:56.27,00:35:56.27,"they're over theretalking about it,"
841,00:35:57.70,00:35:57.70,"when you thinkthey're conniving against you,"
842,00:35:59.47,00:35:59.47,here's what you got to do.
843,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,"You got to say,""Man, those people like me."
844,00:36:03.83,00:36:03.83,"""Look at them, they're overthere talking about me."
845,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,"They're talking abouthow wonderful I am."""
846,00:36:08.03,00:36:08.03,-You do that...-Yeah?
847,00:36:09.40,00:36:09.40,...you'll never getyour dauber down.
848,00:36:10.97,00:36:10.97,Yup.
849,00:36:11.97,00:36:11.97,"Well, just don't worry aboutwhat anybody else is thinking."
850,00:36:14.03,00:36:14.03,Don't worry aboutwhat anybody else is saying.
851,00:36:17.67,00:36:17.67,I just cry...
852,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,Sometimes you just wantto cry?
853,00:36:21.83,00:36:21.83,"Yeah, sometimesI just want to cry."
854,00:36:23.70,00:36:23.70,"Well, that's okay."
855,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,Crying's good for you.
856,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,SHII ANN: Which one of these things is not like the other?
857,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67, Okay? I'm the only minority on this island.
858,00:36:33.33,00:36:33.33, I'd forgotten how
859,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,culturally differentI am from the mass of America.
860,00:36:38.93,00:36:38.93, So I'm sticking out like a sore thumb.
861,00:37:11.53,00:37:11.53,"Hey, guys."
862,00:37:13.20,00:37:13.20,"Tonight, task at hand--"
863,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,vote out another memberfrom your own tribe.
864,00:37:18.23,00:37:18.23,"Before we get to the vote, Robb,"
865,00:37:20.47,00:37:20.47,straight scoop-- what's youguys' impression of Chuay Gahn?
866,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,"They seem like a happy bunchof people,"
867,00:37:25.43,00:37:25.43,"like they're all getting alongpretty well, and, uh,"
868,00:37:28.17,00:37:28.17,"good for them, man."
869,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,You guys think you're strongerthan Chuay Gahn?
870,00:37:31.43,00:37:31.43,"For sure. Without a doubt.Come on, bro."
871,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,"Come on, bro?Who's sitting at Tribal Council?"
872,00:37:35.77,00:37:35.77,ROBB:Hey. This is one...
873,00:37:37.27,00:37:37.27,I-I thinkwe're still up on them.
874,00:37:38.77,00:37:38.77,"I'm just saying,you're not kicking their ass."
875,00:37:41.03,00:37:41.03,Mm. We'll see what the futureholds for Chuay Gahn.
876,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,"All I know is, tonightsomebody's going home,"
877,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,"because you guys losttoday, so..."
878,00:37:47.03,00:37:47.03,-It's all right.-That is a fact.
879,00:37:48.67,00:37:48.67,"That is a fact, Jack."
880,00:37:52.30,00:37:52.30,"Stephanie, you were sickfirst couple of days, right?"
881,00:37:55.40,00:37:55.40,Are you contributingas much as anybody else?
882,00:37:56.87,00:37:56.87,"STEPHANIE:I was sick, and-and..."
883,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,"but I overcame it,and I think that, you know,"
884,00:38:01.30,00:38:01.30,"yeah, I'm still contributingjust as much as everyone else,"
885,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"and I'm really proud of them,"
886,00:38:05.03,00:38:05.03,"'cause they-they were kind ofstruggling at first, I thought,"
887,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,"as far as the survivor mode.Um... because in the beginning,"
888,00:38:10.73,00:38:10.73,"they were a little more focusedon the shelter,"
889,00:38:13.07,00:38:13.07,"you know, and I didn't thinkthat that was priority, in-in"
890,00:38:15.63,00:38:15.63,"the situation that we were in,where food and water was..."
891,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,"was, uh, what we neededto... to survive."
892,00:38:20.83,00:38:20.83,"And, uh,they've come a long way."
893,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,They're doinga whole lot better.
894,00:38:23.70,00:38:23.70,"Ken, when you hearthat kind of a comment,"
895,00:38:25.47,00:38:25.47,"is that, ""That's Stephanie,we-we know that,"""
896,00:38:27.73,00:38:27.73,or does that surprise you that
897,00:38:28.93,00:38:28.93,she was sort of sitting backthere and feeling that way?
898,00:38:31.47,00:38:31.47,"KEN: No, it didn't surprise meat all."
899,00:38:33.17,00:38:33.17,"I mean, it was... it was obvious"
900,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"that she had no interestin the shelter, and"
901,00:38:36.53,00:38:36.53,"from square one, their mainpriority was food and..."
902,00:38:39.57,00:38:39.57,and water.
903,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,PROBST:Okay.
904,00:38:42.00,00:38:42.00,"Obviously, nobody tookthe offer up"
905,00:38:44.70,00:38:44.70,"on the switch, but"
906,00:38:46.40,00:38:46.40,"strategically,will anybody admit"
907,00:38:48.67,00:38:48.67,"that you went throughthe process of thinking,"
908,00:38:50.40,00:38:50.40,"""All right, this is a game."
909,00:38:51.77,00:38:51.77,"Do I gain anythingfrom doing this?"""
910,00:38:54.13,00:38:54.13,"Shii Ann, did it gothrough your head at all?"
911,00:38:56.17,00:38:56.17,"I thought about it for, like,two seconds, but really, no,"
912,00:38:59.03,00:38:59.03,"because I really likethis tribe, and"
913,00:39:00.57,00:39:00.57,"I feel very comfortable here,and I don't..."
914,00:39:02.57,00:39:02.57,I don't thinkI want to switch at this time.
915,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,Time to vote.
916,00:39:06.60,00:39:06.60,"Penny, you're first."
917,00:39:22.13,00:39:22.13,"Tonight I'm votingfor Stephanie,"
918,00:39:24.27,00:39:24.27,"um, based on what happenedthe first week of camp."
919,00:39:26.90,00:39:26.90,There were a few wordsthat were exchanged
920,00:39:29.03,00:39:29.03,"that were not very nice,"
921,00:39:30.70,00:39:30.70,and some thingsthat were done at camp
922,00:39:32.90,00:39:32.90,that a few of usdidn't appreciate.
923,00:39:50.20,00:39:50.20,"Shii, I do thinkyou're a sweet girl,"
924,00:39:52.20,00:39:52.20,"but you really geton my nerves, so,"
925,00:39:54.97,00:39:54.97,have to vote for you.
926,00:40:13.70,00:40:13.70,Tonight my vote's for Steph.

928,00:40:18.13,00:40:18.13,and I just wishyou hadn't alienated yourself
929,00:40:20.13,00:40:20.13,so much from the start.
930,00:40:21.83,00:40:21.83,And then we could have seen
931,00:40:23.27,00:40:23.27,just how beautiful a personyou really were.
932,00:40:36.83,00:40:36.83,"Sorry, girl."
933,00:40:38.53,00:40:38.53,"You get on my nerves, andI don't like being around you."
934,00:40:41.03,00:40:41.03,Nothing personal.
935,00:40:50.97,00:40:50.97,I'll go tally the votes.
936,00:41:06.63,00:41:06.63,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
937,00:41:08.73,00:41:08.73,The person voted outwill be asked
938,00:41:10.87,00:41:10.87,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.

947,00:41:54.13,00:41:54.13,That's enough.You need to bring me your torch.
948,00:42:05.97,00:42:05.97,"Stephanie, the tribe has spoken."
949,00:42:10.97,00:42:10.97,"Good luck, guys."
