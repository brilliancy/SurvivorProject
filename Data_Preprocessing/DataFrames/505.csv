2,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.00,00:00:03.00," At Chuay Gahn,  Ted and Ghandia were no longer"
4,00:00:05.80,00:00:05.80," on speaking terms,  following their confrontation."
5,00:00:08.87,00:00:08.87,The relationship between Ghandia and I
6,00:00:09.83,00:00:09.83, is nonexistent.
7,00:00:10.83,00:00:10.83, I only see five people on  this island.
8,00:00:12.67,00:00:12.67,PROBST: Their rift divided  the tribe along gender lines.
9,00:00:15.87,00:00:15.87,HELEN:  I do believe Ghandia's story.
10,00:00:17.60,00:00:17.60, The guys will believe  Ted's side.
11,00:00:19.20,00:00:19.20,PROBST: Stephanie was  on the outs with Sook Jai.
12,00:00:21.50,00:00:21.50,STEPHANIE:  They got rid of Jed.
13,00:00:22.83,00:00:22.83,Piss on them.
14,00:00:23.90,00:00:23.90,SHII ANN: I don't know  what Stephanie's problem is.
15,00:00:25.90,00:00:25.90," Honestly,  I think she just feels"
16,00:00:27.23,00:00:27.23,-like we're all idiots. -Go!
17,00:00:29.00,00:00:29.00,"PROBST:  At the reward challenge,"
18,00:00:30.47,00:00:30.47, Sook Jai's physical strength
19,00:00:32.17,00:00:32.17, secured them another victory.
20,00:00:34.23,00:00:34.23, Along with it  came bananas and chickens.
21,00:00:37.53,00:00:37.53,"We're going to check for eggs every day,"
22,00:00:38.87,00:00:38.87,and I expect there to be eggs!
23,00:00:40.60,00:00:40.60,PROBST:  Sook Jai also won immunity.
24,00:00:42.37,00:00:42.37,-Sook Jai wins immunity! -Sook Jai!
25,00:00:44.47,00:00:44.47,Yeah!
26,00:00:46.57,00:00:46.57,"PROBST:  Back at Chuay Gahn,"
27,00:00:47.93,00:00:47.93, Ghandia wanted the women  to vote for Clay.
28,00:00:49.87,00:00:49.87,But here's where I'm thinking with this.
29,00:00:51.63,00:00:51.63,"If we keep the girls together, then we have a leverage"
30,00:00:53.93,00:00:53.93,-of a three-to-two vote. -Mm-hmm. All right.
31,00:00:55.83,00:00:55.83,I will be so happy tonight if Clay is gone.
32,00:00:58.03,00:00:58.03,PROBST: But Helen was torn  between her loyalty to Ghandia
33,00:01:01.20,00:01:01.20, and her desire  to play the game.
34,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63,"HELEN: I want to play,  but it would mean"
35,00:01:04.37,00:01:04.37, voting Ghandia off tonight.
36,00:01:05.90,00:01:05.90,"Honestly, right now, I'm still betwixt and between."
37,00:01:09.37,00:01:09.37,"PROBST: In the end,  gender lines broke down."
38,00:01:11.60,00:01:11.60," Helen jumped ship, voting  Ghandia out of the tribe."
39,00:01:14.17,00:01:14.17,Tribe has spoken.
40,00:01:17.00,00:01:17.00, 12 are left.
41,00:01:18.00,00:01:18.00, Who will be voted out tonight?
42,00:02:33.23,00:02:33.23,"Here, I'll put it back in the same place."
43,00:02:44.03,00:02:44.03,CLAY: We had a very interesting  Tribal Council.
44,00:02:47.00,00:02:47.00," Little bit of a shocker.  Now, we knew that Jan"
45,00:02:49.27,00:02:49.27," was being manipulated  by, uh, Ghandia,"
46,00:02:52.03,00:02:52.03, but we didn't know just...  just how much.
47,00:02:54.27,00:02:54.27,Why the hell did she vote for me?
48,00:02:56.23,00:02:56.23,"That, uh, didn't make a whole lot of sense."
49,00:02:59.27,00:02:59.27," Her head's the one that's got  the ""X"" on it the next time."
50,00:03:01.93,00:03:01.93, She's the next one to go.
51,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,"JAN:  Uh, I voted for Clay."
52,00:03:08.80,00:03:08.80," Clay will know it's me,  and he doesn't"
53,00:03:10.67,00:03:10.67,"forgive or forget, so I know I'm next to go."
54,00:03:14.23,00:03:14.23, Helen said she was going
55,00:03:15.53,00:03:15.53," to vote for Clay,  but she did not."
56,00:03:17.33,00:03:17.33," It's her vote--  she can choose to change it,"
57,00:03:19.97,00:03:19.97, and I think she changed it.
58,00:03:21.87,00:03:21.87,BRIAN: It's been a long day.
59,00:03:23.43,00:03:23.43,(loud yawning)
60,00:03:24.80,00:03:24.80,HELEN:  I know the gir... the girls
61,00:03:26.23,00:03:26.23," are gonna think I betrayed  them, and I'm just gonna"
62,00:03:28.67,00:03:28.67," have to live with that, but..."
63,00:03:30.23,00:03:30.23, it was... one of those
64,00:03:31.70,00:03:31.70,necessary evils.
65,00:03:32.93,00:03:32.93,"Had to be done, but it wasn't enjoyable to do."
66,00:03:35.30,00:03:35.30,"And, um..."
67,00:03:36.60,00:03:36.60," if that gets me further  ahead, then so be it."
68,00:03:49.90,00:03:49.90,(chickens clucking)
69,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,(rooster crowing)
70,00:03:58.03,00:03:58.03,(chickens clucking)
71,00:03:59.87,00:03:59.87,"PENNY: We had already decided  that when we woke up,"
72,00:04:02.33,00:04:02.33," as soon as we  heard the rooster crow,"
73,00:04:04.30,00:04:04.30, we were gonna get up  and we were gonna
74,00:04:06.57,00:04:06.57,"eat, you know, one of the chickens this morning."
75,00:04:09.03,00:04:09.03,"(chickens clucking, squawking)"
76,00:04:11.47,00:04:11.47,"JAKE: Steph, if you hold it, I'll kill it, okay?"
77,00:04:13.97,00:04:13.97,STEPHANIE: All right.
78,00:04:23.57,00:04:23.57,(cracking)
79,00:04:25.23,00:04:25.23,STEPHANIE: I got up and grabbed him and...
80,00:04:27.67,00:04:27.67,"and held him while Jake, you know, broke his neck, and then"
81,00:04:30.63,00:04:30.63," we proceeded  to, uh, boil the pot of water"
82,00:04:33.13,00:04:33.13, and put him in there  to loosen the feathers up
83,00:04:35.03,00:04:35.03, and pluck the feathers  out of him...
84,00:04:36.40,00:04:36.40," Then we just boiled him  for, like, an hour."
85,00:04:55.57,00:04:55.57,"Mmm, he smells good!"
86,00:04:56.77,00:04:56.77,He smells great.
87,00:04:58.30,00:04:58.30,Everybody come dive in.
88,00:04:59.83,00:04:59.83,"Oh, my gosh."
89,00:05:01.13,00:05:01.13,"Pull a piece off, or however you want to do it."
90,00:05:05.47,00:05:05.47,"JAKE: We thank you for giving your life,"
91,00:05:07.00,00:05:07.00,"Mr. Bird, but, boy,"
92,00:05:08.43,00:05:08.43,"I tell you what, you sure do taste good."
93,00:05:10.47,00:05:10.47,"Mmm, mmm!"
94,00:05:12.77,00:05:12.77,SHII ANN:  It was so tasty.
95,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87," It was probably--  I mean, it was so tough,"
96,00:05:17.00,00:05:17.00," it was like eating leather  a little bit,"
97,00:05:19.00,00:05:19.00,but it was the best-tasting chicken
98,00:05:20.37,00:05:20.37,I've ever had in my entire life.
99,00:05:22.00,00:05:22.00,"Guys, it doesn't get any better than this."
100,00:05:24.43,00:05:24.43,"SHII ANN: Oh, my God."
101,00:05:26.07,00:05:26.07,Who said they wanted the liver?
102,00:05:27.70,00:05:27.70,I'll eat the heart and the liver.
103,00:05:29.37,00:05:29.37,"ROBB: Shii Ann had a piece,  and she ate"
104,00:05:31.20,00:05:31.20, lungs and intestines and necks  and picked the bones
105,00:05:34.03,00:05:34.03," so that there's nothing left.  I don't know,"
106,00:05:36.27,00:05:36.27,her eating habits are just repulsive.
107,00:05:44.27,00:05:44.27,This has got to be the best.
108,00:05:45.97,00:05:45.97," She licks her fingers  too much,"
109,00:05:47.43,00:05:47.43, then tries... reaches back in  and grabs stuff
110,00:05:49.03,00:05:49.03,while everybody else is eating.
111,00:05:50.37,00:05:50.37,She's just gross.
112,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,"Robb, if you want to try some of the neck,"
113,00:05:53.60,00:05:53.60,there's a lot of meat around it.
114,00:05:54.80,00:05:54.80,Yech!
115,00:05:56.13,00:05:56.13,"SHII ANN:  Culturally, it's not"
116,00:05:57.73,00:05:57.73,"an American thing to eat, like,"
117,00:06:00.00,00:06:00.00, necks and hearts and gizzards  and stuff like that.
118,00:06:03.20,00:06:03.20,Most people don't eat that stuff.
119,00:06:04.77,00:06:04.77,"There's a lot more on here, if you guys want to pick at it."
120,00:06:08.17,00:06:08.17," In my family, the heart is..."
121,00:06:10.23,00:06:10.23," it's great eats, you know?"
122,00:06:11.77,00:06:11.77, I grew up partly in Taiwan.
123,00:06:13.23,00:06:13.23," In Taiwan, it's considered  a great snack."
124,00:06:16.03,00:06:16.03,-The neck is gone; I ate it. -ROBB: You ate the whole neck?
125,00:06:18.37,00:06:18.37,"Yeah, it was good."
126,00:06:33.40,00:06:33.40,Crabs are very slim.
127,00:06:35.97,00:06:35.97,It's horrible. I don't see 'em running.
128,00:06:37.47,00:06:37.47,"I mean, you don't... you don't even see any."
129,00:06:39.33,00:06:39.33,"I mean, that's, you know, if I could see 'em"
130,00:06:41.40,00:06:41.40,"just running off, at least I'd know there's"
131,00:06:43.07,00:06:43.07,"some out there, but right now I don't even see any running off."
132,00:06:45.97,00:06:45.97,"So, uh, it's very frustrating."
133,00:06:48.23,00:06:48.23,"Boy, I would like..."
134,00:06:49.73,00:06:49.73,"I would like one, just a little bit of that taste right now."
135,00:06:52.57,00:06:52.57,It'd be wonderful.
136,00:06:54.27,00:06:54.27,-I got one. -HELEN: Aw.
137,00:06:55.60,00:06:55.60,All that time.
138,00:06:57.70,00:06:57.70,Do you want to go fishing?
139,00:06:58.87,00:06:58.87,-Yeah. -TED: Our food situation
140,00:07:00.27,00:07:00.27, is-is-is getting pretty bad.
141,00:07:02.70,00:07:02.70, We're missing out on  a lot of things.
142,00:07:05.10,00:07:05.10," I mean,"
143,00:07:06.10,00:07:06.10,"we have to get fish, we have to get fish."
144,00:07:12.03,00:07:12.03,"BRIAN:  Now, the only thing"
145,00:07:13.87,00:07:13.87,we're hoping for right now is that the fish
146,00:07:15.60,00:07:15.60,are gonna go underneath our boat and get stuck in this net.
147,00:07:17.73,00:07:17.73,TED: True.
148,00:07:18.87,00:07:18.87,"Come on, fishy, fishy, fishy."

150,00:07:24.63,00:07:24.63,TED: Brian and I went out  fishing today just to see
151,00:07:28.20,00:07:28.20,"where we are, if we're still together,"
152,00:07:30.07,00:07:30.07,if we're still really in... in alliance with each other.
153,00:07:33.77,00:07:33.77,One of the things we-we've got to kind of do is...
154,00:07:36.53,00:07:36.53,have each other's back.
155,00:07:38.67,00:07:38.67,I don't know what it is about you...
156,00:07:40.47,00:07:40.47,"-Yeah, we got... -...but I think we got a lot in common."
157,00:07:43.17,00:07:43.17,We have a lot in common.
158,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,"-Yeah. -The future, also, you know?"
159,00:07:46.67,00:07:46.67,"TED:  He's confirmed that yes, he is"
160,00:07:48.23,00:07:48.23,"totally committed to me all the  way to the end, and I'm"
161,00:07:50.83,00:07:50.83,totally committed to him all the way to the end.
162,00:07:52.83,00:07:52.83,"I mean, you have my word, and I-I-I swear on my daughter."
163,00:07:56.20,00:07:56.20,You don't have to worry about me.
164,00:07:59.70,00:07:59.70,"BRIAN: It's the, uh, thinking  before you speak and act"
165,00:08:03.23,00:08:03.23," that's extremely  important, so..."
166,00:08:05.53,00:08:05.53,you just have to remind yourself
167,00:08:06.90,00:08:06.90,every day what you're doing out here.
168,00:08:08.47,00:08:08.47,You need all the friends you can get out here.
169,00:08:10.40,00:08:10.40,TED: You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm...

172,00:08:18.20,00:08:18.20,"but very shark-like, very swift."
173,00:08:20.53,00:08:20.53," Move when I need to move,  speak when I need to speak."
174,00:08:22.93,00:08:22.93," Try to be a part  of that majority,"
175,00:08:24.53,00:08:24.53, however which way I can.
176,00:08:25.90,00:08:25.90," Win that favoritism,  win that friendship."
177,00:08:28.73,00:08:28.73,And then keep moving forward.
178,00:08:30.53,00:08:30.53,"It's me and you to the final, bro."
179,00:08:31.73,00:08:31.73,"Yeah, we've already decided that."

181,00:08:34.23,00:08:34.23,Just wanted to make sure.
182,00:08:35.90,00:08:35.90,"Because Old Betsy, we need Betsy now."
183,00:08:37.93,00:08:37.93,There we go.
184,00:08:39.40,00:08:39.40,"-I'm glad we're in the same boat, man. -Yeah."
185,00:08:40.90,00:08:40.90,I just wanted to make sure we were... we were still...
186,00:08:42.77,00:08:42.77,"BRIAN: Like I said before, done."
187,00:08:44.07,00:08:44.07,-It's done. -Done.
188,00:08:53.73,00:08:53.73,"I'm full off that, y'all."
189,00:08:55.50,00:08:55.50,I am real full.
190,00:08:56.67,00:08:56.67,-I'm amazed how... -It was good.
191,00:08:58.03,00:08:58.03,I'm almost in a food coma.
192,00:08:59.27,00:08:59.27,ROBB: I'm gonna go put my swim trunks on and go swimming.
193,00:09:01.37,00:09:01.37,PENNY:  Actually felt like our first
194,00:09:02.80,00:09:02.80," real day off since  we've been here, and we had"
195,00:09:06.47,00:09:06.47, all day to relax.
196,00:09:07.87,00:09:07.87, We had eaten a chicken
197,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23," early in the morning,  and, you know,"
198,00:09:11.87,00:09:11.87, we felt like we  could lay in the sun.
199,00:09:13.63,00:09:13.63," You know, we all  went in the water"
200,00:09:15.17,00:09:15.17,and played a little bit.
201,00:09:24.90,00:09:24.90,JAKE:  The four of us were
202,00:09:26.43,00:09:26.43," out in the water,  just kind of"
203,00:09:28.37,00:09:28.37," goosing around,  just enjoying the..."

205,00:09:32.40,00:09:32.40,and kind of a...
206,00:09:34.07,00:09:34.07," easy day, 'cause we really  didn't have a whole lot to do."
207,00:09:36.87,00:09:36.87, When we heard Robb scream...
208,00:09:39.93,00:09:39.93,(screaming)

210,00:09:45.87,00:09:45.87,so nobody thought too much about it early.
211,00:09:47.70,00:09:47.70,ROBB: You guys!
212,00:09:49.50,00:09:49.50,JAKE:  But then we noticed as he was
213,00:09:51.63,00:09:51.63, coming out of the beach  that blood was kind of
214,00:09:53.73,00:09:53.73, coming out of his foot.
215,00:09:55.07,00:09:55.07,"Something... okay, the wave came,"
216,00:09:56.13,00:09:56.13,"and I kicked, and when my foot went back,"
217,00:09:58.60,00:09:58.60,something came and bit me. I don't know
218,00:10:00.43,00:10:00.43,what out there has a mouth big enough to bite me
219,00:10:02.90,00:10:02.90,"and put a mark like this on me, but it was sharp,"
220,00:10:04.67,00:10:04.67,"and it hurt like hell, whatever it was."
221,00:10:05.97,00:10:05.97,"JAKE: We were all,  uh, kind of wondering"
222,00:10:07.60,00:10:07.60,"what to do, uh, and-and ended up"
223,00:10:10.47,00:10:10.47, putting his foot in hot water.
224,00:10:12.43,00:10:12.43,"...if it's too hot, and then put it back in."
225,00:10:14.37,00:10:14.37,"The hotter... really, the hotter the better"
226,00:10:16.00,00:10:16.00,for what we're talking about here.
227,00:10:17.30,00:10:17.30,ERIN: You don't necessarily  know what's out there.
228,00:10:19.43,00:10:19.43,"It could've been something poisonous,"

230,00:10:21.87,00:10:21.87, that could've been  lethal for Robb.
231,00:10:23.23,00:10:23.23,"-ROBB: What do you think, man? -JAKE: It's got a... Wow."
232,00:10:27.33,00:10:27.33,It's got a nice purple tinge around it.

237,00:10:36.10,00:10:36.10,down around the circle of it.
238,00:10:37.60,00:10:37.60," I think probably  what happened to him was,"
239,00:10:39.43,00:10:39.43, he was wading  without any kind of
240,00:10:41.33,00:10:41.33," shoes on at all,  he probably"
241,00:10:42.87,00:10:42.87,pushed off on a stingray and got a stinger
242,00:10:45.17,00:10:45.17, in his foot.

777,00:33:22.70,00:33:22.70,It's sitting out there waiting to be discovered.
778,00:33:24.60,00:33:24.60,"-I'll check the squid. -PROBST: Still alive,"
779,00:33:26.47,00:33:26.47,Sook Jai. Chuay Gahn's missing a fish.
780,00:33:28.57,00:33:28.57,"PENNY: Come on, keep working. Pass."
781,00:33:33.47,00:33:33.47,"-There, right there. -That's what I'm looking for."
782,00:33:36.60,00:33:36.60,-Chuay Gahn wins immunity! -CLAY: Yeah!
783,00:33:37.80,00:33:37.80,-TED: Yeah! -HELEN: Oh!
784,00:33:40.53,00:33:40.53,"CLAY: We get fish out of it, too."
785,00:33:42.97,00:33:42.97,"Okay, let's go."
786,00:33:44.57,00:33:44.57,"-One, two three. Chuay Gahn! -Chuay Gahn!"
787,00:33:46.07,00:33:46.07,"-Chuay Gahn! -Thank you, God."
788,00:33:47.30,00:33:47.30,"Boy, did we do that one!"
789,00:33:48.73,00:33:48.73,Yes! Yes!
790,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,Chuay Gahn! Yes!
791,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,"-Chuay Gahn, who wants this? -I'll take it."
792,00:33:54.60,00:33:54.60,"PROBST: Chuay Gahn, you guys can head back to camp."
793,00:33:56.77,00:33:56.77,"Sook Jai, see you guys tonight at Tribal Council."
794,00:33:59.53,00:33:59.53,Somebody's going home.
795,00:34:21.27,00:34:21.27,"SHII ANN: So, who's your favorite on the other team?"
796,00:34:24.37,00:34:24.37,When you looked over?
797,00:34:25.73,00:34:25.73,-They all seem really nice. -Don't they?
798,00:34:27.97,00:34:27.97,STEPHANIE:  When we had the 60 seconds
799,00:34:29.80,00:34:29.80, of silence  where we could decide
800,00:34:31.30,00:34:31.30," whether we wanted  to jump tribes, I wish I had."
801,00:34:33.67,00:34:33.67,"I would have a better chance over there,"
802,00:34:35.33,00:34:35.33,and I think that I would have more fun over there.
803,00:34:37.73,00:34:37.73,I really do.
804,00:34:39.17,00:34:39.17, Everybody is kind of
805,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57," pretty much blah around here,  and I pretty much"
806,00:34:42.50,00:34:42.50, feel as like  they're out to get me.
807,00:34:44.57,00:34:44.57," I could be wrong,  but I feel like I'm next."
808,00:34:53.20,00:34:53.20,ERIN:  Things are going pretty well.
809,00:34:55.37,00:34:55.37, The only kind of dysfunction  we have going on right now
810,00:34:59.03,00:34:59.03, is with Shii Ann.
811,00:35:01.43,00:35:01.43, And I don't even think  she really knows that
812,00:35:03.73,00:35:03.73,we even really have that much of a dysfunction going on with her.
813,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,ERIN: I can't believe it.
814,00:35:08.47,00:35:08.47,She doesn't use her head. She doesn't think.
815,00:35:10.47,00:35:10.47,"ROBB: The most upsetting thing about it is, like,"
816,00:35:12.40,00:35:12.40,"at the reward we had utensils, and she was using her fingers."
817,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,It's just disgusting.
818,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,"Like, all of us have enough manners not to do that."
819,00:35:17.87,00:35:17.87,"ROBB: It's appalling, dude."
820,00:35:19.27,00:35:19.27,"She's a girl, too."
821,00:35:20.43,00:35:20.43,"-Give me a break, dude. -I know."
822,00:35:21.87,00:35:21.87,Who the hell would take her home?
823,00:35:23.27,00:35:23.27,JAKE:  I don't know what it is that
824,00:35:24.87,00:35:24.87,"Shii Ann does that irritates other people,"
825,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,but it's something.
826,00:35:28.30,00:35:28.30,"ROBB: It's funny 'cause Ken says she's a city girl,"
827,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,and they're all like her.
828,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,I don't ever want to meet another New York City girl.
829,00:35:33.60,00:35:33.60,"ERIN: Oh, God, me, neither. She just bugs me so much."
830,00:35:35.33,00:35:35.33,I can't wait to get rid of her.
831,00:35:36.97,00:35:36.97,"JAKE: She doesn't irritate me,  and the reason"
832,00:35:38.70,00:35:38.70," she doesn't irritate  me is because she works,"
833,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,and Shii Ann to me is just one
834,00:35:42.23,00:35:42.23,of the all-time good ones as far as that goes.
835,00:35:44.83,00:35:44.83,"We've had one hell of an experience,"
836,00:35:46.50,00:35:46.50,and we got a lot more days to go.
837,00:35:48.97,00:35:48.97,-This is a third of the way through it. -Yup.
838,00:35:51.43,00:35:51.43,So you can't let your dauber get down.
839,00:35:53.30,00:35:53.30,You just have to keep going.
840,00:35:54.83,00:35:54.83,And when people look like
841,00:35:56.27,00:35:56.27,"they're over there talking about it,"
842,00:35:57.70,00:35:57.70,"when you think they're conniving against you,"
843,00:35:59.47,00:35:59.47,here's what you got to do.
844,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,"You got to say, ""Man, those people like me."
845,00:36:03.83,00:36:03.83,"""Look at them, they're over there talking about me."
846,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,"They're talking about how wonderful I am."""
847,00:36:08.03,00:36:08.03,-You do that... -Yeah?
848,00:36:09.40,00:36:09.40,...you'll never get your dauber down.
849,00:36:10.97,00:36:10.97,Yup.
850,00:36:11.97,00:36:11.97,"Well, just don't worry about what anybody else is thinking."
851,00:36:14.03,00:36:14.03,Don't worry about what anybody else is saying.
852,00:36:17.67,00:36:17.67,I just cry...
853,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50,Sometimes you just want to cry?
854,00:36:21.83,00:36:21.83,"Yeah, sometimes I just want to cry."
855,00:36:23.70,00:36:23.70,"Well, that's okay."
856,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,Crying's good for you.
857,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,SHII ANN: Which one of these  things is not like the other?
858,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67, Okay? I'm the only minority  on this island.
859,00:36:33.33,00:36:33.33, I'd forgotten how
860,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,culturally different I am from the mass of America.
861,00:36:38.93,00:36:38.93, So I'm sticking out  like a sore thumb.
862,00:37:11.53,00:37:11.53,"Hey, guys."
863,00:37:13.20,00:37:13.20,"Tonight, task at hand--"
864,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,vote out another member from your own tribe.
865,00:37:18.23,00:37:18.23,"Before we get to the vote, Robb,"
866,00:37:20.47,00:37:20.47,straight scoop-- what's you guys' impression of Chuay Gahn?
867,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,"They seem like a happy bunch of people,"
868,00:37:25.43,00:37:25.43,"like they're all getting along pretty well, and, uh,"
869,00:37:28.17,00:37:28.17,"good for them, man."
870,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,You guys think you're stronger than Chuay Gahn?
871,00:37:31.43,00:37:31.43,"For sure. Without a doubt. Come on, bro."
872,00:37:33.63,00:37:33.63,"Come on, bro? Who's sitting at Tribal Council?"
873,00:37:35.77,00:37:35.77,ROBB: Hey. This is one...
874,00:37:37.27,00:37:37.27,I-I think we're still up on them.
875,00:37:38.77,00:37:38.77,"I'm just saying, you're not kicking their ass."
876,00:37:41.03,00:37:41.03,Mm. We'll see what the future holds for Chuay Gahn.
877,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,"All I know is, tonight somebody's going home,"
878,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,"because you guys lost today, so..."
879,00:37:47.03,00:37:47.03,-It's all right. -That is a fact.
880,00:37:48.67,00:37:48.67,"That is a fact, Jack."
881,00:37:52.30,00:37:52.30,"Stephanie, you were sick first couple of days, right?"
882,00:37:55.40,00:37:55.40,Are you contributing as much as anybody else?
883,00:37:56.87,00:37:56.87,"STEPHANIE: I was sick, and-and..."
884,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,"but I overcame it, and I think that, you know,"
885,00:38:01.30,00:38:01.30,"yeah, I'm still contributing just as much as everyone else,"
886,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"and I'm really proud of them,"
887,00:38:05.03,00:38:05.03,"'cause they-they were kind of struggling at first, I thought,"
888,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,"as far as the survivor mode. Um... because in the beginning,"
889,00:38:10.73,00:38:10.73,"they were a little more focused on the shelter,"
890,00:38:13.07,00:38:13.07,"you know, and I didn't think that that was priority, in-in"
891,00:38:15.63,00:38:15.63,"the situation that we were in, where food and water was..."
892,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,"was, uh, what we needed to... to survive."
893,00:38:20.83,00:38:20.83,"And, uh, they've come a long way."
894,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,They're doing a whole lot better.
895,00:38:23.70,00:38:23.70,"Ken, when you hear that kind of a comment,"
896,00:38:25.47,00:38:25.47,"is that, ""That's Stephanie, we-we know that,"""
897,00:38:27.73,00:38:27.73,or does that surprise you that
898,00:38:28.93,00:38:28.93,she was sort of sitting back there and feeling that way?
899,00:38:31.47,00:38:31.47,"KEN: No, it didn't surprise me at all."
900,00:38:33.17,00:38:33.17,"I mean, it was... it was obvious"
901,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"that she had no interest in the shelter, and"
902,00:38:36.53,00:38:36.53,"from square one, their main priority was food and..."
903,00:38:39.57,00:38:39.57,and water.
904,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,PROBST: Okay.
905,00:38:42.00,00:38:42.00,"Obviously, nobody took the offer up"
906,00:38:44.70,00:38:44.70,"on the switch, but"
907,00:38:46.40,00:38:46.40,"strategically, will anybody admit"
908,00:38:48.67,00:38:48.67,"that you went through the process of thinking,"
909,00:38:50.40,00:38:50.40,"""All right, this is a game."
910,00:38:51.77,00:38:51.77,"Do I gain anything from doing this?"""
911,00:38:54.13,00:38:54.13,"Shii Ann, did it go through your head at all?"
912,00:38:56.17,00:38:56.17,"I thought about it for, like, two seconds, but really, no,"
913,00:38:59.03,00:38:59.03,"because I really like this tribe, and"
914,00:39:00.57,00:39:00.57,"I feel very comfortable here, and I don't..."
915,00:39:02.57,00:39:02.57,I don't think I want to switch at this time.
916,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,Time to vote.
917,00:39:06.60,00:39:06.60,"Penny, you're first."
918,00:39:22.13,00:39:22.13,"Tonight I'm voting for Stephanie,"
919,00:39:24.27,00:39:24.27,"um, based on what happened the first week of camp."
920,00:39:26.90,00:39:26.90,There were a few words that were exchanged
921,00:39:29.03,00:39:29.03,"that were not very nice,"
922,00:39:30.70,00:39:30.70,and some things that were done at camp
923,00:39:32.90,00:39:32.90,that a few of us didn't appreciate.
924,00:39:50.20,00:39:50.20,"Shii, I do think you're a sweet girl,"
925,00:39:52.20,00:39:52.20,"but you really get on my nerves, so,"
926,00:39:54.97,00:39:54.97,have to vote for you.
927,00:40:13.70,00:40:13.70,Tonight my vote's for Steph.
928,00:40:15.70,00:40:15.70,"Steph, you're a beautiful, beautiful person,"
929,00:40:18.13,00:40:18.13,and I just wish you hadn't alienated yourself
930,00:40:20.13,00:40:20.13,so much from the start.
931,00:40:21.83,00:40:21.83,And then we could have seen
932,00:40:23.27,00:40:23.27,just how beautiful a person you really were.
933,00:40:36.83,00:40:36.83,"Sorry, girl."
934,00:40:38.53,00:40:38.53,"You get on my nerves, and I don't like being around you."
935,00:40:41.03,00:40:41.03,Nothing personal.
936,00:40:50.97,00:40:50.97,I'll go tally the votes.
937,00:41:06.63,00:41:06.63,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
938,00:41:08.73,00:41:08.73,The person voted out will be asked
939,00:41:10.87,00:41:10.87,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
940,00:41:12.63,00:41:12.63,I'll read the votes.
941,00:41:16.13,00:41:16.13,First vote...
942,00:41:18.60,00:41:18.60,Steph.
943,00:41:23.47,00:41:23.47,Steph. That's two votes-- Steph.
944,00:41:31.37,00:41:31.37,Shii Ann.
945,00:41:38.23,00:41:38.23,"Shii Ann. It's two votes-- Shii Ann, two votes-- Steph."
946,00:41:46.03,00:41:46.03,"Stephanie, that's three votes."
947,00:41:49.50,00:41:49.50,Fourth vote-- Steph.
948,00:41:54.13,00:41:54.13,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
949,00:42:05.97,00:42:05.97,"Stephanie, the tribe has spoken."
950,00:42:10.97,00:42:10.97,"Good luck, guys."
951,00:42:12.63,00:42:12.63,See you.
952,00:42:13.77,00:42:13.77,"Bye, babe."
953,00:42:25.07,00:42:25.07,"PROBST: Well, you guys have been out here 15 days,"
954,00:42:27.40,00:42:27.40,"a long time for sure,"
955,00:42:28.93,00:42:28.93,but just a little over the third of the way into this game.
956,00:42:32.40,00:42:32.40,Think about it. Sleep on it.
957,00:42:33.73,00:42:33.73,"Take your torches, head back to camp."
958,00:42:35.30,00:42:35.30,"Good night, guys."
959,00:42:49.20,00:42:49.20,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
960,00:42:55.70,00:42:55.70, PROBST: Next time on  Survivor...
961,00:42:57.77,00:42:57.77," It's sink or swim  at Chuay Gahn,"
962,00:42:59.30,00:42:59.30, when the guys search  for their boat.
963,00:43:00.47,00:43:00.47,HELEN:   The guys are not even
964,00:43:02.10,00:43:02.10,what I would classify as swimmers.
965,00:43:03.33,00:43:03.33,TED: This is the most swimming  I've ever done in my life.
966,00:43:05.87,00:43:05.87,"PROBST: And at Sook Jai,  Ken and Robb have it out."
967,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80,You got some set of balls to approach me with this.
968,00:43:11.93,00:43:11.93,"Don't ... try to tell me that I'm doing something I'm not,"
969,00:43:13.97,00:43:13.97,all right? 'Cause I'm not ... stupid.
970,00:43:20.70,00:43:20.70,"I just want to say that, um,"
