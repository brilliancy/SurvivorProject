8,00:00:20.07,00:00:20.07,easy first place finish. Mogo Mogo wins reward.
9,00:00:23.47,00:00:23.47,Giving them first pick from the losing Saboga tribe.

11,00:00:32.40,00:00:32.40,along for the ride. >> The biggest reward was
12,00:00:36.07,00:00:36.07,dismantling Saboga. >> PROBST: And Chapera chose
13,00:00:38.33,00:00:38.33,Rupert and Jenna. >> Welcome aboard.
14,00:00:40.80,00:00:40.80,">> PROBST: At Chapera, Rupert and Jenna were happy to have a"
15,00:00:43.30,00:00:43.30,new home. >> Our camp was Hobo Junction.
16,00:00:46.33,00:00:46.33,Theirs is the Taj Mahal. >> PROBST: Things got physical
17,00:00:50.87,00:00:50.87,when the two tribes battled for immunity.
18,00:00:53.77,00:00:53.77,">> Come on, Sue, you got it. >> Sue, get up there."
19,00:00:56.20,00:00:56.20,">> I want this one. Come on, baby."
20,00:00:58.23,00:00:58.23,>> PROBST: And Sue had a close encounter with Richard.

24,00:01:11.00,00:01:11.00,vote out Ethan. >> Richard's the one we've
25,00:01:13.50,00:01:13.50,we've got to get rid of. He's a cancer in this tribe.
26,00:01:16.43,00:01:16.43,">> PROBST: When Richard found out, he teamed up with the girls"
27,00:01:19.50,00:01:19.50,to foil Colby's plan. >> How dare you approach
28,00:01:21.30,00:01:21.30,somebody to get rid of me? You must go bye-bye now.
29,00:01:25.13,00:01:25.13,>> PROBST: And Kathy found herself caught in the middle.

31,00:01:31.87,00:01:31.87,"Colby spoke out. >> You cannot coast, although"
32,00:01:34.67,00:01:34.67,a lot of people are doing it. >> PROBST: And proved he was a
33,00:01:38.33,00:01:38.33,power to be reckoned with when his plan succeeded.

40,00:03:28.77,00:03:28.77,>> Last night was the biggest scramble at the last
41,00:03:34.17,00:03:34.17,minute as Richard Hatch was scurrying about trying to save
42,00:03:37.83,00:03:37.83,his own butt. Right as we were leaving for
43,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,"Tribal Council, we grabbed our torches and I looked at Kathy"
44,00:03:47.20,00:03:47.20,"and I said, ""Who are we voting for?"""
45,00:03:50.50,00:03:50.50,"And she said ""Hatch."" >> I have some"
46,00:03:57.23,00:03:57.23,"questions for you Kath. >> Yes, darling."
47,00:03:59.47,00:03:59.47,>> What happened last night? >> Yeah.
48,00:04:02.40,00:04:02.40,>> The decision last night at Tribal for me was I
49,00:04:04.23,00:04:04.23,could have swung Shii Ann and Jerri to vote for Colby.
50,00:04:07.60,00:04:07.60,"Instead, I decided to stay with what Colby wanted, which was to"
51,00:04:10.67,00:04:10.67,vote Richard Hatch off. >> He's the Richard Hatch
52,00:04:22.03,00:04:22.03,now of the group. >> Don't give me that
53,00:04:24.30,00:04:24.30,"loyalty ..., Colby. I tried to put together my gut"
54,00:04:27.23,00:04:27.23,instincts about what it was going to be like to come back to
55,00:04:30.27,00:04:30.27,"the tribe, having made that big decision to"
56,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,oust Colby without consulting with Lex.
57,00:04:36.60,00:04:36.60,I just think the repercussion would put a schism between
58,00:04:39.93,00:04:39.93,"myself and Lex, and Lex would feel totally betrayed."
59,00:04:43.50,00:04:43.50,"And I know Lex. He then would never trust me, so"
60,00:04:46.60,00:04:46.60,"in the 11th hour, I decided to vote for Richard Hatch."
61,00:04:49.97,00:04:49.97,I saved Colby's ass. I made it look like we saved
62,00:04:52.63,00:04:52.63,him. >> You're so powerful right now.
63,00:04:56.63,00:04:56.63,Kathy's the biggest power player of all.
64,00:04:59.03,00:04:59.03,She's got all of us wrapped around her fingers.
65,00:05:01.37,00:05:01.37,"And if nobody's noticing that, she's one darn good player."
66,00:05:21.70,00:05:21.70,>> That's where you put the strap in?
67,00:05:23.87,00:05:23.87,">> Uh-huh. See, and it's such a good spear"
68,00:05:26.20,00:05:26.20,"it's already drawn blood on me, so I know it's going to draw"
69,00:05:28.27,00:05:28.27,blood on fish. >> That's good.
70,00:05:30.17,00:05:30.17,">> Hell, yeah. I love that."
71,00:05:32.50,00:05:32.50,">> To be honest with you, it put pressure on me when"
72,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,"Rupert and Jenna come because it threw another cog in the game,"
73,00:05:40.37,00:05:40.37,"but I really like old Rupert. He's kind of like me, he's easy-"
74,00:05:43.40,00:05:43.40,"going, nothing don't bother him. And I know it may cost me down"
75,00:05:47.30,00:05:47.30,"the road because, you know, he could easily take my place."
76,00:05:50.30,00:05:50.30,"I wonder if down here in this little cove right here, it'll be"
77,00:05:53.80,00:05:53.80,shallower. >> The role of provider
78,00:05:56.83,00:05:56.83,is wide open here. I like the fact that none of
79,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93,them could fish. >> Rupert?
80,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,>> Yeah? >> You want them both?
81,00:06:06.23,00:06:06.23,">> Ah, good. A few of them would eat the"
82,00:06:09.70,00:06:09.70,"snails, that attach to the sides of the rock, but I want to be"
83,00:06:13.07,00:06:13.07,"the guy that brings, you know, a couple of dozen oysters and a"
84,00:06:16.00,00:06:16.00,couple fish in every day. >> You want help picking
85,00:06:18.80,00:06:18.80,"those up? >> No. I'm doing all right, man."
86,00:06:22.23,00:06:22.23,We're never going to take them all anyway.
87,00:06:24.93,00:06:24.93,You always got to leave some back so the other guys know
88,00:06:27.80,00:06:27.80,where to come. >> Sue is playing her own game.
89,00:06:31.70,00:06:31.70,>> ( humming tune ) >> She wants to be that
90,00:06:34.47,00:06:34.47,"provider, but the only meat that she's providing right now are"
91,00:06:37.63,00:06:37.63,"those cone snails, which I think most of the people eat."
92,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,">> First, nobody likes these damn things."
93,00:06:44.57,00:06:44.57,Now everybody likes them. It sort of pisses me off because
94,00:06:47.37,00:06:47.37,"I'm not eating the rice. Oh, recollect."
95,00:07:18.03,00:07:18.03,>> I want to catch some fish. Grizzly Adams out there trying
96,00:07:22.97,00:07:22.97,to pretend like he's a big man. He brought home two little fish
97,00:07:26.53,00:07:26.53,the whole time he's been here. Rupert's catching fish-- I'm
98,00:07:29.50,00:07:29.50,happy. He can continue to feed me until
99,00:07:33.27,00:07:33.27,"it's time for him to go, and that time will be determined by"
100,00:07:37.13,00:07:37.13,me. So he'd better catch a lot of
101,00:07:39.73,00:07:39.73,"fish, keep my belly full. >> My strategy of"
102,00:08:02.33,00:08:02.33,"flying under the radar was pointed out by Colby last night,"
103,00:08:05.47,00:08:05.47,"which by the way, was not the smartest move on his part, to"
104,00:08:08.53,00:08:08.53,"say, ""Well, those who are flying under the radar are not going to"
105,00:08:11.87,00:08:11.87,"get by me."" I felt like that was a direct"
106,00:08:14.50,00:08:14.50,"attack at me. >> Shii Ann, you've said"
107,00:08:17.03,00:08:17.03,"before, you know, you guys just tell me what we're doing and I'm"
108,00:08:19.70,00:08:19.70,good with that. I didn't have any respect for
109,00:08:22.07,00:08:22.07,that game plan the first time I played this game.
110,00:08:25.30,00:08:25.30,It's just very easy to allow someone else to be the bad guy.
111,00:08:28.73,00:08:28.73,"And yesterday, that was me. >> You think you were"
112,00:08:31.33,00:08:31.33,the bad guy yesterday? >> Ultimately I ended up
113,00:08:33.27,00:08:33.27,almost getting chopped because I sat up on that hill and told
114,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,"Ethan he had nothing to worry about, that we were going for"
115,00:08:37.90,00:08:37.90,Richard. And then I came down and lied
116,00:08:40.10,00:08:40.10,right to Richard's face and told him the same thing.
117,00:08:42.37,00:08:42.37,Someone like you doesn't have to lie this entire game because you
118,00:08:44.50,00:08:44.50,"don't make a decision. It's very easy to sit in a tent,"
119,00:08:48.03,00:08:48.03,wait until an hour before Tribal Council for someone to walk in
120,00:08:50.90,00:08:50.90,"and tell you who we're voting for and say, ""Okay, I'll go"
121,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,"along with that."" Man, that's an easy game to"
122,00:08:55.13,00:08:55.13,play. That's an easy game to make it a
123,00:08:57.63,00:08:57.63,long way. I don't have had any respect for
124,00:09:00.50,00:09:00.50,"that. If that's your game, that's a"
125,00:09:03.10,00:09:03.10,"very brilliant game. It will work, but you can't..."
126,00:09:05.60,00:09:05.60,">> Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Lecture, lecture, lecture."
127,00:09:08.73,00:09:08.73,"Captain America with his good teeth, nice smile, handsome guy."
128,00:09:12.60,00:09:12.60,"I'm just like... ( snoring ). Oh, I'm sorry. Are you done?"
129,00:09:16.70,00:09:16.70,>> Everyone's got to play... >> I agree.
130,00:09:18.60,00:09:18.60,>> ...and it takes more than just showing up and writing
131,00:09:20.77,00:09:20.77,"a name on a ticket to be a player in this game, as far as"
132,00:09:23.40,00:09:23.40,I'm concerned. >> He doesn't respect
133,00:09:25.50,00:09:25.50,my game-- I don't necessarily respect his.
134,00:09:28.17,00:09:28.17,We're equal. But I'm not dumb enough to tell
135,00:09:30.60,00:09:30.60,him that. >> Which one looks like a
136,00:09:45.47,00:09:45.47,lucky coconut? This one.
137,00:09:49.13,00:09:49.13,>> Can you imagine us going into a merge seven to four?
138,00:09:54.53,00:09:54.53,>> That'd be great. >> Even seven to five.
139,00:09:57.47,00:09:57.47,I'd be thrilled. It guarantees us all seven at
140,00:10:01.33,00:10:01.33,least. >> We're kind of sitting
141,00:10:04.10,00:10:04.10,back and watching what's going on and waiting to go see what
142,00:10:07.40,00:10:07.40,happens. We don't really know Jenna and
143,00:10:10.10,00:10:10.10,Rupert all that well. We haven't played with them.
144,00:10:12.57,00:10:12.57,They just came into this tribe a few days ago.
145,00:10:15.43,00:10:15.43,Now we won the first immunity challenge against Mogo Mogo
146,00:10:18.43,00:10:18.43,since we've formed seven in each tribe.
147,00:10:21.30,00:10:21.30,Be interesting to see who they vote off.
148,00:10:24.07,00:10:24.07,">> Yeah. Hell, yeah. >> The next thing that we want"
149,00:10:26.80,00:10:26.80,to see is who gets voted out. They had to go to Tribal
150,00:10:29.80,00:10:29.80,Council. Who'd they vote out?
151,00:10:32.20,00:10:32.20,>> I think Jerri's gone. >> They may be tired of old
152,00:10:35.10,00:10:35.10,Hatch. I would be.
153,00:10:36.80,00:10:36.80,>> I wish. >> Richard probably is
154,00:10:38.67,00:10:38.67,making them insane. I would do my damnedest to have
155,00:10:41.37,00:10:41.37,him voted off the first time we lost.
156,00:10:44.37,00:10:44.37,">> Oh, I hope they vote him off, you guys."
157,00:10:47.30,00:10:47.30,"If Ethan's getting fish, I hope to God they vote him off."
158,00:10:50.13,00:10:50.13,I still can't... they better talk to Richard about what he
159,00:10:52.93,00:10:52.93,did to me at that challenge. >> That was tough.
160,00:10:56.43,00:10:56.43,>> Anything that Richard could have done...
161,00:10:59.23,00:10:59.23,"was, like, what he does, he does all the time-- he just gets"
162,00:11:02.83,00:11:02.83,"naked. Well, at this point, we're over"
163,00:11:04.83,00:11:04.83,"it. So yesterday, what happened at"
164,00:11:07.33,00:11:07.33,"the challenge, he throws his hands up in the air and thrusts"
165,00:11:11.50,00:11:11.50,his hips and starts rubbing himself on me.
166,00:11:14.03,00:11:14.03,"He does not deserve to be here. Anybody that's won, as far as"
167,00:11:18.53,00:11:18.53,"I'm concerned, Ethan and, like, Rich should be the first ones to"
168,00:11:21.87,00:11:21.87,go. >> Yes.
169,00:11:24.93,00:11:24.93,">> Oh, I will go hug them all. >> Nights are really long here."
170,00:12:02.80,00:12:02.80,They're like 12 hours long. It's awful.
171,00:12:04.43,00:12:04.43,"All night I laid there thinking every time I woke up, I could"
172,00:12:07.90,00:12:07.90,re-feel Richard naked. It kept flashing through my
173,00:12:13.60,00:12:13.60,head. And I started feeling really
174,00:12:16.90,00:12:16.90,bad. Like why did he have to touch
175,00:12:22.37,00:12:22.37,me? He didn't touch nobody else.
176,00:12:25.00,00:12:25.00,"Why didn't he just walk by me? >> You know why, 'cause"
177,00:12:45.77,00:12:45.77,"the more she thinks about it, she's like, ""My husband's going"
178,00:12:48.10,00:12:48.10,"to know about this."" He's going to freak out."
179,00:12:50.33,00:12:50.33,I mean it's not a good scenario for her.
180,00:12:52.80,00:12:52.80,">> She probably wants to be alone right now, huh?"
181,00:12:57.67,00:12:57.67,">> This morning when we woke up, Sue was not herself."
182,00:13:02.43,00:13:02.43,I didn't realize how much she had been affected by what
183,00:13:05.13,00:13:05.13,happened to her until she started to cry.
184,00:13:07.33,00:13:07.33,"It's affecting us because it's affecting you, but we're all"
185,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,"right. I mean, we're more worried about"
186,00:13:11.83,00:13:11.83,"you than anything, do you know what I mean?"
187,00:13:14.20,00:13:14.20,">> I mean, it's, like, gross. I've been with one partner for"
188,00:13:16.47,00:13:16.47,20 years. Never even thought about kissing
189,00:13:18.53,00:13:18.53,another guy. >> There was nothing you
190,00:13:20.23,00:13:20.23,"could do, Sue. You know he's not going to be"
191,00:13:22.27,00:13:22.27,mad at you. >> There's something I can
192,00:13:24.07,00:13:24.07,do and I ain't going to get it done laying on this beach.
193,00:13:27.23,00:13:27.23,">> You need to get it all out, Sue."
194,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,"Just be mad, be upset. She just couldn't control her"
195,00:13:35.40,00:13:35.40,"tears, and she couldn't control her anger."
196,00:13:38.77,00:13:38.77,It's really hard to try to console somebody who feels that
197,00:13:41.83,00:13:41.83,way. There was nothing I can do.
198,00:13:45.37,00:13:45.37,">> I think sleeping on it, she must have thought about"
199,00:13:48.13,00:13:48.13,"it all night last night. >> Yeah, she did."
200,00:13:50.30,00:13:50.30,She's thinking about her husband and she's really upset about it.
201,00:13:53.67,00:13:53.67,">> It's like another one of those situations, Amber, where,"
202,00:13:57.50,00:13:57.50,"like, you don't know... is she just ... around because like,"
203,00:14:01.20,00:14:01.20,she's a smart player and she's trying to get some money out of
204,00:14:04.33,00:14:04.33,"this, she wants to sue him or is like, just something that's"
205,00:14:07.53,00:14:07.53,"really bothering her? But a situation this serious,"
206,00:14:09.63,00:14:09.63,you can't even screw around. You got to give her the benefit
207,00:14:12.17,00:14:12.17,"of the doubt. Sue is either, A) Looking to"
208,00:14:15.07,00:14:15.07,cash in on a huge payday-- sue the ... out of Richard Hatch;
209,00:14:19.23,00:14:19.23,Or Sue is really emotionally distraught by the whole thing.
210,00:14:22.87,00:14:22.87,Or Sue's using this as some kind of a leverage to play the game
211,00:14:26.30,00:14:26.30,of Survivor. Nobody knows what Sue's thinking
212,00:14:29.20,00:14:29.20,except Sue. >> I think it's just
213,00:14:31.83,00:14:31.83,gotten worse and worse in her head as it's gone along.
214,00:14:34.47,00:14:34.47,"I think maybe at first she was thinking, oh, you know, I can"
215,00:14:37.17,00:14:37.17,get him for this. But now it's really starting to
216,00:14:39.27,00:14:39.27,"bother her. As the day went on, she had more"
217,00:14:41.67,00:14:41.67,and more time to think about it. And when you're out here playing
218,00:14:44.43,00:14:44.43,"this game, your mind does crazy things."
219,00:14:46.67,00:14:46.67,And so I think that just made the situation worse.
220,00:14:48.77,00:14:48.77,I think if we were in another situation not even playing
221,00:14:51.93,00:14:51.93,"Survivor and that would have happened, it might not have been"
222,00:14:54.67,00:14:54.67,as big as a deal maybe as it turned out to be.
223,00:15:03.50,00:15:03.50,">> You hungry, Sue? You want to cook those eyeballs"
224,00:15:06.13,00:15:06.13,up? >> No.
225,00:15:08.33,00:15:08.33,>> You holler when you want to cook them-- we'll cook
226,00:15:10.63,00:15:10.63,"them up and fry them up. Sue was distant, nonresponsive,"
227,00:15:14.23,00:15:14.23,throwing in the towel. Are you okay?
228,00:15:20.67,00:15:20.67,At the time of the challenge and all the contact and all that
229,00:15:26.87,00:15:26.87,"with Richard, Sue could have handled it different."
230,00:15:32.43,00:15:32.43,"She could have stopped right then and said ""foul."""
231,00:15:35.87,00:15:35.87,"Instead, she turns her head, says, ""Oh, that's gross,"" and"
232,00:15:40.07,00:15:40.07,"goes on. Thinks about it, processes it,"
233,00:15:43.03,00:15:43.03,"comes up with her own agenda, and goes on with that."
234,00:15:52.53,00:15:52.53,>> You can't argue her point. I don't feel what she's feeling.
235,00:15:58.30,00:15:58.30,"I don't. I mean, it didn't happen to me."
236,00:16:01.50,00:16:01.50,I couldn't possibly understand how... She's humiliated.
237,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,She feels completely humiliated. >> That's right.
238,00:16:20.53,00:16:20.53,">> Earlier, Sue was vital to this tribe that we couldn't"
239,00:16:23.67,00:16:23.67,get rid of her. But I want it to be known right
240,00:16:26.50,00:16:26.50,"up, by God, I don't need her. She's very overbearing, and in"
241,00:16:29.73,00:16:29.73,"my opinion, if it was up to old jungle cat, I say stick a fork"
242,00:16:35.57,00:16:35.57,"in her, she's done. >> What I'm doing is I'm"
243,00:16:50.10,00:16:50.10,making a grocery list. It's ending up being pretty much
244,00:16:53.97,00:16:53.97,"all sweet, but I've got... I started off pretty healthy."
245,00:16:57.43,00:16:57.43,"Coming from Saboga, we really had a food advantage on our"
246,00:17:00.70,00:17:00.70,island. We had an endless supply of
247,00:17:02.80,00:17:02.80,"plantains, tons of coconuts. And then I get here to Mogo Mogo"
248,00:17:07.23,00:17:07.23,and all they have right now is rice.
249,00:17:10.60,00:17:10.60,"I need honey-roasted extra crunchy peanut butter, Peanut"
250,00:17:13.97,00:17:13.97,"Butter Crunch, marshmallows, big and small."
251,00:17:16.77,00:17:16.77,"Bananas, apples... gala apples. >> I hate talking about"
252,00:17:20.07,00:17:20.07,food this early in the game. It drives me crazy because then
253,00:17:23.03,00:17:23.03,"all after sudden I have this mirage in my brain, you know, of"
254,00:17:26.00,00:17:26.00,just this big giant ice cream sundae.
255,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,It doesn't make me feel good to get cravings.
256,00:17:31.73,00:17:31.73,">> Milk chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, marshmallow creme,"
257,00:17:34.83,00:17:34.83,graham crackers with cinnamon... >> I am a little bit
258,00:17:37.67,00:17:37.67,concerned about the food situation.
259,00:17:39.87,00:17:39.87,I don't like the fact that our main food provider got voted out
260,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,because I knew every day he'd bring back a fish.
261,00:17:48.20,00:17:48.20,"Oh, Richard Hatch, I miss you already."
262,00:17:51.17,00:17:51.17,Where is the fish? >> I actually thought
263,00:17:58.43,00:17:58.43,about that this morning. I thought about getting up
264,00:18:00.87,00:18:00.87,and going out with a sling. >> You haven't tried it
265,00:18:03.13,00:18:03.13,"yet, have you? >> Not here, no."
266,00:18:04.77,00:18:04.77,I want to. I really wanted to wait until
267,00:18:07.30,00:18:07.30,Richard was out of the picture before I picked up the spear
268,00:18:10.40,00:18:10.40,because I didn't want it to be a competitive thing.
269,00:18:13.67,00:18:13.67,I knew that Richard was really kind of territorial with the
270,00:18:15.83,00:18:15.83,"whole fishing chore, and that was fine."
271,00:18:18.13,00:18:18.13,>> Good luck. >> Easy.
272,00:18:38.27,00:18:38.27,>> Yes! >> He's a natural.
273,00:18:40.43,00:18:40.43,>> I wanted to take on the fisherman's role.
274,00:18:42.47,00:18:42.47,"However, I didn't try to fish today."
275,00:18:44.57,00:18:44.57,"I'm sitting back a little bit, you know, I let him do it all"
276,00:18:47.50,00:18:47.50,today. >> Sharp shooter.
277,00:18:56.33,00:18:56.33,We should have gotten rid of Richard a long time ago.
278,00:19:00.20,00:19:00.20,>> I didn't think it was necessary to let everyone know
279,00:19:03.00,00:19:03.00,that I was an accomplished fisherman.
280,00:19:05.67,00:19:05.67,I think kind of holding your cards a little closer is always
281,00:19:08.13,00:19:08.13,"a good idea in Survivor. >> Yay, the heroes."
282,00:19:15.23,00:19:15.23,It's so funny. You guys look like the guys have
283,00:19:17.67,00:19:17.67,been out for days getting food. >> I got three or four
284,00:19:20.30,00:19:20.30,different kinds. There's some small ones for
285,00:19:22.53,00:19:22.53,"flavor. >> Oh, my God, Lex!"
286,00:19:24.30,00:19:24.30,They're awesome. Look at them all laid out.
287,00:19:26.67,00:19:26.67,It's like a trophy room. >> Wow.
288,00:19:28.90,00:19:28.90,"Lex is a competitor. This is not his first rodeo, as"
289,00:19:32.20,00:19:32.20,"we say in Texas. Because of his ability to fish,"
290,00:19:34.73,00:19:34.73,that is something you check in the back of your mind knowing
291,00:19:37.77,00:19:37.77,that ultimately I'm competing against Lex. Wow.
292,00:19:41.57,00:19:41.57,">> What a treat, getting a taste of all these different"
293,00:19:44.33,00:19:44.33,kinds of fish. >> I know.
294,00:19:45.80,00:19:45.80,It's fun. >> I think that I've got the
295,00:19:48.17,00:19:48.17,favor of the girls right now. If I can show them that I can
296,00:19:51.17,00:19:51.17,"provide them with food, there's no reason for them to feel any"
297,00:19:53.77,00:19:53.77,compulsion to keep the other two guys around.
298,00:20:15.10,00:20:15.10,">> I came in yesterday, felt like a sacrificial lamb."
299,00:20:17.67,00:20:17.67,">> Right. >> Like, just, I felt"
300,00:20:19.40,00:20:19.40,"Rupert can get you guys food and stuff, but, like, if you guys"
301,00:20:21.77,00:20:21.77,"are serious... >> No, we're dead serious"
302,00:20:23.60,00:20:23.60,because me and Rob want to save our asses.
303,00:20:26.00,00:20:26.00,"Like, I'm trying to save my ass but I know Sue wants to get"
304,00:20:28.67,00:20:28.67,rid of me. Rob and I came up with the idea
305,00:20:31.13,00:20:31.13,"to approach Rupert and Jenna, tell them that you know, we"
306,00:20:33.40,00:20:33.40,"think we're on the outs, we think we're in trouble."
307,00:20:36.17,00:20:36.17,We'll save you if you save us. >> But what makes us
308,00:20:38.97,00:20:38.97,believe that you guys aren't coming to us like Alicia came to
309,00:20:41.37,00:20:41.37,you? >> What would we have to
310,00:20:43.60,00:20:43.60,"lose by coming to you, you know? >> I don't know."
311,00:20:47.00,00:20:47.00,>> Momentum is huge in this game.
312,00:20:49.73,00:20:49.73,"When you have it, you want to keep it."
313,00:20:52.50,00:20:52.50,Rupert has a squeaky clean image and attitude.
314,00:20:55.23,00:20:55.23,"There's something about him I just don't trust, so I, uh,"
315,00:20:59.30,00:20:59.30,I formed an alliance with him. >> We are taking a huge
316,00:21:02.30,00:21:02.30,risk at you guys going back and telling the other guys.
317,00:21:05.27,00:21:05.27,">> No, trust me. I'd much rather go in with you"
318,00:21:07.40,00:21:07.40,"guys. >> But I just, and I felt that"
319,00:21:09.60,00:21:09.60,you guys would hopefully want to go with us.
320,00:21:11.60,00:21:11.60,">> Yes. No, we do."
321,00:21:13.10,00:21:13.10,">> Hell, yes. >> When I first"
322,00:21:15.27,00:21:15.27,started this Survivor: All- Star and I hear people
323,00:21:17.60,00:21:17.60,"talking and you know saying that they want to help me, or"
324,00:21:20.73,00:21:20.73,"saying that they want me on their side, I couldn't trust any"
325,00:21:23.73,00:21:23.73,"of them. Now after 16 days, I know that"
326,00:21:26.43,00:21:26.43,"I can trust Jenna, I hope that I can trust Rob and Amber."
327,00:21:30.70,00:21:30.70,I feel pretty confident with where I'm at.
328,00:21:34.17,00:21:34.17,">> If you honestly honor your alliance, you go to"
329,00:21:37.37,00:21:37.37,"the end, no matter what. But always somebody, like,"
330,00:21:40.77,00:21:40.77,gets greedy at one point. Once it gets to the final
331,00:21:44.23,00:21:44.23,"four, then we can, you know, every man for themselves."
332,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50,>> Exactly. >> You got to look at me.
333,00:21:50.70,00:21:50.70,>> I'm cool with it if you guys are cool with it.
334,00:21:53.33,00:21:53.33,You have my word. >> I'm beautiful with it.
335,00:21:55.93,00:21:55.93,">> All right, done. I've got alliances with"
336,00:21:57.87,00:21:57.87,"everybody now, except Sue and Alicia."
337,00:22:00.07,00:22:00.07,"I mean, we can turn around tomorrow and kick Jenna and"
338,00:22:02.73,00:22:02.73,Rupert off. They can be here as
339,00:22:04.87,00:22:04.87,sacrificial lambs. We've got to see what's going
340,00:22:07.30,00:22:07.30,"on. It's my game, buddy."
341,00:22:27.33,00:22:27.33,">> Why do we have tree mail? >> ""You'll do some high-"
342,00:22:32.23,00:22:32.23,"stepping while rewards sail through the sky, so wave your"
343,00:22:35.80,00:22:35.80,hands and stomp your feet. Your taste buds will tell you
344,00:22:38.37,00:22:38.37,"why."" This is coffee in here, by the"
345,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,way. ( sniffing )
346,00:22:43.47,00:22:43.47,"Smell. >> Oh, my God."
347,00:22:45.63,00:22:45.63,>> We could try to make coffee with this.
348,00:22:47.63,00:22:47.63,">> Oh, my God, I'd be up for five days."
349,00:22:51.30,00:22:51.30,I've been dying all day today to be alone with Lex for a few
350,00:22:55.93,00:22:55.93,"minutes, just to kind of put things in order."
351,00:22:59.57,00:22:59.57,"Listen, Lex, I just want you to know, you can trust me."
352,00:23:04.03,00:23:04.03,">> Okay. >> 150,000%."
353,00:23:07.87,00:23:07.87,>> Okay. >> I absolutely adore you.
354,00:23:10.53,00:23:10.53,">> Okay. And you know I trust you, too."
355,00:23:13.03,00:23:13.03,>> Good. And I want you to.
356,00:23:15.03,00:23:15.03,">> I do. >> Because I, personally,"
357,00:23:17.47,00:23:17.47,"out of everybody here, would love to go with you."
358,00:23:22.20,00:23:22.20,">> I appreciate that, Jerri. The conversation I had with"
359,00:23:25.77,00:23:25.77,Jerri was completely sincere. I don't have any reason to
360,00:23:28.93,00:23:28.93,feel that it was anything but. But I am going to do whatever
361,00:23:32.33,00:23:32.33,"it takes to get me further in the game, and that if that"
362,00:23:35.10,00:23:35.10,means exploiting situations where I have a friend that
363,00:23:37.30,00:23:37.30,"might trust me, I'll do it. It's business this time."
364,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,>> What if the reward challenge was a grill and
365,00:23:49.30,00:23:49.30,seasonings and some meat... >> Some seasonings?
366,00:23:53.70,00:23:53.70,">> Oh, my god. >> And a bottle of wine."
367,00:23:55.83,00:23:55.83,>> And a bottle of wine. >> Two bottles of wine.
368,00:23:58.13,00:23:58.13,>> Five bottles. >> Five bottles of wine.
369,00:24:00.17,00:24:00.17,>> That'd be the best reward right now.
370,00:24:03.00,00:24:03.00,">> Every day, we talk about food out here because as"
371,00:24:06.27,00:24:06.27,"good as the rice is, it's terrible."
372,00:24:09.83,00:24:09.83,And it has there has to be some light at the end of the
373,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,tunnel. We're starving over here.

380,00:24:55.73,00:24:55.73,"Ultimately, Sue having her own agenda, will hinder her."
381,00:25:00.50,00:25:00.50,It alienates her from the tribe.

562,00:35:35.13,00:35:35.13,">> Uh-uh. >> Yeah, you do today."
563,00:35:37.30,00:35:37.30,>> It was good. I just wanted to rub my face in
564,00:35:39.60,00:35:39.60,it. I wanted to sleep next to it.
565,00:35:41.53,00:35:41.53,Oh! >> To a great win.
566,00:35:43.23,00:35:43.23,">> Mm-hmm. Hear, hear."
567,00:35:45.07,00:35:45.07,>> Unbelievable team. >> Mm-hmm.
568,00:35:46.63,00:35:46.63,>> Yeah. >> I hope there's no ill will
569,00:35:48.67,00:35:48.67,on the other side because we didn't take any of the stuff
570,00:35:51.37,00:35:51.37,and share it. >> They wanted to play.
571,00:35:53.03,00:35:53.03,">> Yeah? >> Well, that's the"
572,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,"thing, is-is having Sue leave and then losing the challenge,"
573,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"they're going back somewhat demoralized, yeah."
574,00:35:59.20,00:35:59.20,">> No, no, yeah, that's... Yeah, it's going to hurt them."
575,00:36:01.43,00:36:01.43,>> It's a good thing Rich wasn't here.
576,00:36:03.23,00:36:03.23,>> Oh. I don't even want to think about
577,00:36:05.43,00:36:05.43,what that scene would have been. >> I think he would be
578,00:36:07.63,00:36:07.63,mortified. I think the guy does have a
579,00:36:09.87,00:36:09.87,soul. >> I know Richard Hatch.
580,00:36:11.77,00:36:11.77,"As jerky as he might seem, he is not someone who would purposely"
581,00:36:15.70,00:36:15.70,go and sexually violate someone. >> Angry woman.
582,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,>> She must have been feeling something awful for 24
583,00:36:23.07,00:36:23.07,hours to have exploded like that.
584,00:36:24.90,00:36:24.90,>> Uh. >> I felt terrible for
585,00:36:27.10,00:36:27.10,her that she felt so violated and that she felt so humiliated
586,00:36:29.57,00:36:29.57,and insulted. Very mixed emotions.
587,00:36:31.27,00:36:31.27,>> I thought it was brutal. I know it's a horrible thing
588,00:36:34.40,00:36:34.40,"that happened, but my God. That was hard for all of us"
589,00:36:37.23,00:36:37.23,to hear. I don't like her for it.
590,00:36:39.40,00:36:39.40,I'm sorry. I know she went through a lot.
591,00:36:41.97,00:36:41.97,"Still, you got to learn how to contain your emotions."
592,00:36:46.87,00:36:46.87,I was really offended that she'd bring us that far into her core
593,00:36:50.30,00:36:50.30,of hatred. I didn't like it.
594,00:36:52.13,00:36:52.13,So... I don't know if that's
595,00:36:54.33,00:36:54.33,"mean-spirited, but that's how I feel."
596,00:37:07.87,00:37:07.87,>> You think she was influenced?
597,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,You think Sue was influenced... to do what she did by leaving
598,00:37:14.87,00:37:14.87,the game? >> You know?
599,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,"I sat and talked with her for an hour up here, trying to convince"
600,00:37:27.30,00:37:27.30,her that she could still... She could still pursue whatever
601,00:37:30.43,00:37:30.43,she wanted without throwing the game away.
602,00:37:34.60,00:37:34.60,"You know, now as it stands, we kind of gave them a hell of a"
603,00:37:37.87,00:37:37.87,gift. >> Yeah.
604,00:37:39.07,00:37:39.07,>> We didn't give them anything. >> We didn't.
605,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93,"Sue gave them a hell of a gift. With Richard getting voted off,"
606,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"Sue walking out, and losing the challenge, three strikes--"
607,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73,Chapera was almost out for a few minutes.
608,00:38:00.93,00:38:00.93,">> All right. >> Look, guys, there's no"
609,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,"reason why, no matter what, we should be able to win this, if"
610,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,"you think about it, right? We're six strong, they're six"
611,00:38:09.60,00:38:09.60,"strong. And then we can just roll, one"
612,00:38:12.60,00:38:12.60,"right after another, after another."
613,00:38:14.73,00:38:14.73,>> If we stay strong together... >> Then it comes down to us six.
614,00:38:17.07,00:38:17.07,>> Mm-hmm. >> Then whatever.
615,00:38:18.43,00:38:18.43,>> I agree wholehearted. >> Let's all make a pact
616,00:38:20.97,00:38:20.97,to stick together. >> You want to do that?
617,00:38:22.70,00:38:22.70,">> Yes. >> This is it, guys."
618,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,"( all talking ) >> I'm in it, no matter what."
619,00:38:28.20,00:38:28.20,">> No matter what. >> Go, Chapera."
620,00:38:30.23,00:38:30.23,">> One, two, three... >> Chapera!"
621,00:38:32.50,00:38:32.50,>> We all promised each other we'd stick together no
622,00:38:34.33,00:38:34.33,"matter what. What that really means, I don't"
623,00:38:37.33,00:38:37.33,"know, but it's a good gesture, and it's a good show of faith."
624,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,>> Hmm! >> Get ready.
625,00:38:59.53,00:38:59.53,">> Rupe, what's the look on the face?"
626,00:39:01.90,00:39:01.90,>> We got tree mail. >> All right.
627,00:39:03.87,00:39:03.87,">> Oh, let's see. ""A friend of yours has left the"
628,00:39:06.97,00:39:06.97,game. There will be no challenge
629,00:39:09.87,00:39:09.87,"played tonight."" >> Heads down."
630,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37,( humming ) >> Let's have a moment
631,00:39:14.47,00:39:14.47,of silence for Sue. >> For Sue.
632,00:39:17.90,00:39:17.90,">> So, I need to... >> Too bad we don't have any"
633,00:39:20.43,00:39:20.43,whiskey to show her how we really feel.
634,00:39:22.57,00:39:22.57,( Rupert laughs ) >> Let's have some rice.
635,00:39:24.60,00:39:24.60,>> Let's drink to her. >> Is it ready for lunch
636,00:39:26.30,00:39:26.30,already? >> Let's have a drink.
637,00:39:29.50,00:39:29.50,">> It means a lot to lose a member of our tribe,"
638,00:39:31.37,00:39:31.37,especially the way that we had to lose Sue.
639,00:39:34.23,00:39:34.23,But you can never count out Chapera for making a sad moment
640,00:39:37.17,00:39:37.17,"into a happy moment. We're the happy tribe, and"
641,00:39:39.67,00:39:39.67,"somehow, we always find a way to laugh about it."
642,00:39:42.73,00:39:42.73,">> Tom, now that your favorite girl's gone, we're"
643,00:39:45.43,00:39:45.43,going to sing a song for you. >> Okay.
644,00:39:47.87,00:39:47.87,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Ding dong The witch is gone
645,00:39:50.53,00:39:50.53,\xe2\x99\xaa The wicked witch The wicked witch
646,00:39:52.87,00:39:52.87,Ding dong The wicked witch is gone... \xe2\x99\xaa
647,00:39:55.47,00:39:55.47,"Tom's happiest day here. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Farewell, good-bye"
648,00:39:57.33,00:39:57.33,Farewell... \xe2\x99\xaa >> \xe2\x99\xaa She's gone
649,00:39:59.07,00:39:59.07,"Where the goblins gone \xe2\x99\xaa Below, below, below"
650,00:40:00.73,00:40:00.73,Yo-ho Let's... \xe2\x99\xaa
651,00:40:02.23,00:40:02.23,>> Yippee! ( cheering and hooting )
652,00:40:04.60,00:40:04.60,>> Yay! >> Superstar.
653,00:40:06.40,00:40:06.40,">> Give me an ""S."" ( cheering )"
654,00:40:08.23,00:40:08.23,"Give me a ""U."" >> U."
655,00:40:09.87,00:40:09.87,">> Give me an ""E."" >> E."
656,00:40:11.77,00:40:11.77,>> Whoopee. >> S-U-E.
657,00:40:13.77,00:40:13.77,>> I miss her so much. >> It was a sad day in Bedrock.
658,00:40:16.33,00:40:16.33,>> It was... It was heart-wrenching.
659,00:40:18.57,00:40:18.57,>> It's hard to get over. ( laughs )
660,00:40:20.87,00:40:20.87,">> I wasn't real happy with... I mean, I know Big Tom and Sue"
661,00:40:23.63,00:40:23.63,"didn't get along, but his insensitivity in doing the"
662,00:40:26.40,00:40:26.40,"""Sue's Gone"" dance, I think is pretty crummy."
663,00:40:33.27,00:40:33.27,We lost a valuable member of this tribe.
664,00:40:36.03,00:40:36.03,She was like a guy. Sue is hard-core.
665,00:40:38.30,00:40:38.30,And we can count on her every time we went to a challenge.
666,00:40:41.13,00:40:41.13,And everybody knows that. I don't care if you like her or
667,00:40:43.87,00:40:43.87,"you don't like her. >> Ah, Sue..."
668,00:40:45.87,00:40:45.87,">> Well, at least that's what we assumed."
669,00:40:47.80,00:40:47.80,>> Right. >> It's somewhat of a relief.
670,00:40:49.87,00:40:49.87,>> Sue is out of the game. We're going to be six to six.
671,00:40:52.23,00:40:52.23,>> And at least we know that it's playing out the fair way
672,00:40:54.43,00:40:54.43,we wanted it to. >> That's right.
673,00:40:55.97,00:40:55.97,>> Yes... >> That's right.
674,00:40:57.70,00:40:57.70,That's the most important. >> It definitely disappoints me
675,00:40:59.67,00:40:59.67,that Sue couldn't keep it together.
676,00:41:01.83,00:41:01.83,"I mean, I can't help but wish that she was still here."
677,00:41:05.20,00:41:05.20,"We were up a member. But Survivor's true test is, if"
678,00:41:08.03,00:41:08.03,"you're able to keep it together and keep each other happy, then"
679,00:41:11.50,00:41:11.50,"you're good to go. Yeah, we've had bad days, we"
680,00:41:14.37,00:41:14.37,"have our lows, but we have so many more highs."
681,00:41:17.27,00:41:17.27,And that's what we concentrate on in this tribe.
682,00:41:19.30,00:41:19.30,We don't even think about our lows for very long.
683,00:41:21.63,00:41:21.63,"We always think about the highs. >> All right, people, come"
684,00:41:24.20,00:41:24.20,forward. >> My girls.
685,00:41:28.47,00:41:28.47,My girls know how to make rice. >> That's right.
686,00:41:31.67,00:41:31.67,">> Oh, my God. >> You can keep the"
687,00:41:34.43,00:41:34.43,oysters and the snails. This is what Survivor is all
688,00:41:37.97,00:41:37.97,about. ( Rupert laughs )
