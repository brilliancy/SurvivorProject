1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: We are cruising
2,00:00:08.58,00:00:08.58,through a remote and absolutely breathtaking section of the
3,00:00:11.17,00:00:11.17,Pacific. Crystal-clear water that is home
4,00:00:13.83,00:00:13.83,"to one of the most spectacular natural wonders of the world,"
5,00:00:17.92,00:00:17.92,"the island paradise of Palau. It is a unique landscape,"
6,00:00:24.42,00:00:24.42,"featuring hundreds of lush islands,"
7,00:00:27.25,00:00:27.25,magnificent coral reefs and an underwater sanctuary
8,00:00:30.92,00:00:30.92,of sea life like no other. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
9,00:00:35.46,00:00:35.46,"Sharks, manta rays, giant clams, and literally"
10,00:00:38.46,00:00:38.46,millions of jellyfish. But this paradise has
11,00:00:43.12,00:00:43.12,an infamous history. These waters were home to some
12,00:00:46.38,00:00:46.38,"of the most fierce battles of World War II,"
13,00:00:48.71,00:00:48.71,and the remnants of war haunt these jungles
14,00:00:51.21,00:00:51.21,and litter the ocean floor in a watery grave.
15,00:00:54.62,00:00:54.62,It is an eerie mix of man's explosive past
16,00:00:57.42,00:00:57.42,"and nature's power to reclaim. For the first time ever,"
17,00:01:04.29,00:01:04.29,there are 20 survivors. They've been set adrift with
18,00:01:07.71,00:01:07.71,only the clothes on their backs and one canteen of water each.
19,00:01:12.08,00:01:12.08,Everything they've come to expect about the way this game
20,00:01:16.50,00:01:16.50,"begins will soon be wiped out. 39 days, 20 people,"
21,00:01:23.79,00:01:23.79,one survivor. (theme song playing)
22,00:02:04.21,00:02:04.21,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Welcome... to Survivor: Palau.
23,00:03:48.21,00:03:48.21,"Just behind you, that beach is your new home."
24,00:03:53.12,00:03:53.12,"Waiting for you, you will find:"
25,00:03:55.08,00:03:55.08,"two machetes, one map to water,"
26,00:03:58.21,00:03:58.21,along with the most valuable thing in this game: immunity.
27,00:04:01.17,00:04:01.17,There are two immunity necklaces.
28,00:04:04.12,00:04:04.12,"One for the first woman, one for the first man"
29,00:04:07.54,00:04:07.54,who can get to shore and claim them.
30,00:04:14.96,00:04:14.96,How you get to shore is up to you.
31,00:04:16.67,00:04:16.67,"You're still about a mile out. You can paddle in,"
32,00:04:19.21,00:04:19.21,"you can start swimming, a little of both."
33,00:04:21.83,00:04:21.83,"You are all on your own, it is your choice,"
34,00:04:25.17,00:04:25.17,"but I suggest you make a decision and start acting now,"
35,00:04:28.17,00:04:28.17,because this game is on. >> Paddle.
36,00:04:31.96,00:04:31.96,>> Let's paddle. Paddle.
37,00:04:35.25,00:04:35.25,>> PROBST: Good luck. >> Jeff's a son of a bitch.
38,00:04:54.25,00:04:54.25,"I can tell you that. Hell, I thought"
39,00:04:56.21,00:04:56.21,"we were gonna get, you know, some breakfast,"
40,00:04:57.96,00:04:57.96,"food and water or something. Hell, no."
41,00:05:00.92,00:05:00.92,"I knew he was gonna say something like that,"
42,00:05:02.33,00:05:02.33,"that he was gonna say, ""The game is on."""
43,00:05:03.92,00:05:03.92,Something told me. We was...
44,00:05:05.75,00:05:05.75,"pretty much in trouble. >> As we were rowing the boat,"
45,00:05:10.88,00:05:10.88,"and we were getting closer and closer to the beach,"
46,00:05:12.88,00:05:12.88,"everybody was thinking, ""Should I jump out?"
47,00:05:15.04,00:05:15.04,"""Should I swim to the shore? Should I try to beat the boat?"""
48,00:05:21.04,00:05:21.04,>> ( grunts ) >> The fight was on immediately.
49,00:05:27.08,00:05:27.08,"And then people said, ""Oh, I'll take your spot"
50,00:05:30.58,00:05:30.58,"rowing in the back."" And other people were"
51,00:05:33.96,00:05:33.96,"whispering and wondering, oh, is that because they want"
52,00:05:35.96,00:05:35.96,to be at the back of the boat so that when the boat gets close
53,00:05:38.88,00:05:38.88,"to shore, they can run off? >> ( to ""Heart and Soul"" ):"
54,00:05:51.38,00:05:51.38,\xe2\x99\xaa Survivors...  Survivors

56,00:05:58.83,00:05:58.83,">> And we're sitting there on a really hot day,"
57,00:06:02.46,00:06:02.46,"rowing the boat, and this lunatic jumps up"
58,00:06:05.08,00:06:05.08,and starts singing a song-- I wanted
59,00:06:07.29,00:06:07.29,to knock her off with the oar. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Survivors
60,00:06:10.88,00:06:10.88,"And we can take the pain... \xe2\x99\xaa >> I mean, at first, you"
61,00:06:14.08,00:06:14.08,"thought, ""Oh, that's so cute, look, Wanda's singing,"
62,00:06:15.83,00:06:15.83,"oh, how..."" And then she just kept going"
63,00:06:18.21,00:06:18.21,"and going and going, and everybody was just,"
64,00:06:20.75,00:06:20.75,"like, ""Is she gonna stop?"" >> \xe2\x99\xaa We are survivors! \xe2\x99\xaa"
65,00:06:24.12,00:06:24.12,"I've written a bunch of songs for Survivor,"
66,00:06:26.08,00:06:26.08,and I'm all about this being one big party
67,00:06:29.21,00:06:29.21,"as long as it lasts. >> As we were slowly rowing in,"
68,00:06:39.04,00:06:39.04,"I was, like, I think it's close enough,"
69,00:06:41.33,00:06:41.33,"I'm gonna jump, I'm gonna swim. 'Cause I'm a pretty good"
70,00:06:44.21,00:06:44.21,"swimmer, so I figured I could beat the boat."
71,00:06:45.62,00:06:45.62,"Didn't seem like we were moving. Everybody, I'm going."
72,00:06:50.79,00:06:50.79,">> Stephenie just said, ""I can't take it."
73,00:06:52.71,00:06:52.71,"I'm gonna jump in,"" and then I..."
74,00:06:54.42,00:06:54.42,"of course, I was right behind her."
75,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,"I'm out of here. All right, let's go!"
76,00:07:06.88,00:07:06.88,">> Watch out for the oar! >> I got in,"
77,00:07:12.33,00:07:12.33,"and, like, every two strokes, there went the boat,"
78,00:07:14.12,00:07:14.12,"and I was, like, ""Oh, my God, that's the dumbest thing"
79,00:07:16.54,00:07:16.54,"I've ever done."" If we get off,"
80,00:07:18.38,00:07:18.38,can we get back on? What are your names again?
81,00:07:22.08,00:07:22.08,"( others laughing ) Oh, my God!"
82,00:07:26.12,00:07:26.12,"Bad idea, I guess? >> When Stephenie and Jonathan"
83,00:07:29.17,00:07:29.17,"dove in the water, everyone's, like... (sputters)"
84,00:07:31.21,00:07:31.21,"(laughs) ""You don't want to be the first one to dive in!"""
85,00:07:34.58,00:07:34.58,God! That is a gigantic target
86,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,"on your head. >> We were all excited,"
87,00:07:44.04,00:07:44.04,"because we wanted to jump and start swimming,"
88,00:07:47.04,00:07:47.04,but we didn't. We kept waiting and waiting
89,00:07:48.83,00:07:48.83,and waiting. >> The competitive nature
90,00:07:54.04,00:07:54.04,"in me was like, ""You got to take off your shoes and go!"""
91,00:08:35.62,00:08:35.62,( whooping ) >> Good job!
92,00:08:38.25,00:08:38.25,I got the immunity necklace. I was not gonna let that...
93,00:08:42.46,00:08:42.46,little young girl beat me. >> Whoo!
94,00:08:46.88,00:08:46.88,>> Good job. Nice to meet you.
95,00:08:49.00,00:08:49.00,What was your name again? >> Jeff.
96,00:08:50.21,00:08:50.21,">> Ian. >> Good job, man."
97,00:08:52.71,00:08:52.71,">> Ian, he was the first one up there."
98,00:08:55.25,00:08:55.25,"Get his ass up there, skinny boy, I'm telling you,"
99,00:08:57.38,00:08:57.38,"that's a fast little booger. Well, I don't even know"
100,00:09:02.79,00:09:02.79,"if we have a tribe,  because I noticed"
101,00:09:05.12,00:09:05.12,"the banner just says, ""SURVIVOR: Palau."""
102,00:09:08.71,00:09:08.71,It doesn't have any tribe name on it.
103,00:09:10.88,00:09:10.88,">> One map, we're all together. >> Because you've never seen"
104,00:09:15.21,00:09:15.21,"the game start this way, with 20 people, you get a little..."
105,00:09:17.79,00:09:17.79,I found myself getting a little paranoid.
106,00:09:19.62,00:09:19.62,"You know, we're not a tribe, we don't have our buffs,"
107,00:09:22.17,00:09:22.17,we're just getting to know everyone's name.
108,00:09:23.71,00:09:23.71,">> I'm Jolanda. ""Jo"" if you can't say it."
109,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,">> Oh, you guys, they're out there!"
110,00:09:29.71,00:09:29.71,">> Something's gonna happen, something big's gonna happen."
111,00:09:32.54,00:09:32.54,We can't just remain as a group of 20.
112,00:09:34.75,00:09:34.75,It's a big question mark. We don't have a clue
113,00:09:37.54,00:09:37.54,"what's happening next. >> All right, everybody,"
114,00:09:55.75,00:09:55.75,"let's, um... think about who wants to do"
115,00:09:58.29,00:09:58.29,"water, who wants to do shelter. >> I'll do shelter."
116,00:10:01.21,00:10:01.21,">> I'll do water. >> Okay, water people..."
117,00:10:03.75,00:10:03.75,">> Water. >> So we got one,"
118,00:10:06.12,00:10:06.12,"two, three, four, and Coby's five."
119,00:10:09.12,00:10:09.12,Okay. That sound like a good plan?
120,00:10:10.75,00:10:10.75,>> Say what? >> Five people go look for water
121,00:10:12.92,00:10:12.92,and 15 start on the shelter?
122,00:10:15.08,00:10:15.08,">> Yeah. >> When we got on the beach,"
123,00:10:18.08,00:10:18.08,it was such a bore with all the immunities
124,00:10:20.25,00:10:20.25,and just the craziness of just being dropped off.
125,00:10:22.33,00:10:22.33,"But, actually, I think we got to things fairly quickly."
126,00:10:25.17,00:10:25.17,"I mean, we found the map to the water source,"
127,00:10:27.67,00:10:27.67,"we started thinking about shelter and food,"
128,00:10:29.12,00:10:29.12,"and so people just broke off, a group of four"
129,00:10:31.12,00:10:31.12,broke off to go get water. And then everybody else
130,00:10:33.96,00:10:33.96,"stayed with shelter. I mean, it was very quick,"
131,00:10:35.96,00:10:35.96,it happened very fast. >> He knocked it down
132,00:10:41.88,00:10:41.88,like Paul Bunyan. >> I know. ( laughs )
133,00:10:44.88,00:10:44.88,">> ( to ""Heart and Soul"" ): \xe2\x99\xaa Survivors"

138,00:10:55.38,00:10:55.38,everybody's just walking around in different directions.

142,00:11:04.58,00:11:04.58,"into doing the fire, and I'm just, like,"
143,00:11:06.92,00:11:06.92,"that's a loser job, man. All right."
144,00:11:11.67,00:11:11.67,>> Let's get this going. >> Oh.
145,00:11:17.25,00:11:17.25,I got to go to the bathroom.
146,00:11:18.58,00:11:18.58,>> I'll get some more sticks. >> Do we have a strong man here?
147,00:11:21.62,00:11:21.62,Come on. Are you like Hercules?

151,00:11:30.92,00:11:30.92,"you know, the clothes that we had thought we were gonna have"
152,00:11:33.08,00:11:33.08,"with us. It was really difficult,"
153,00:11:35.25,00:11:35.25,"I know, for a lot of people. But there have been some great"

160,00:11:52.17,00:11:52.17,"I had mine tied up earlier, but... decided to..."

170,00:12:21.58,00:12:21.58,"found the water source, and also found a bag"
171,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,"of everybody's shoes, which was really nice"
172,00:12:25.83,00:12:25.83,"to take back into camp, Like, ""Look, no more stilettos."

178,00:12:44.17,00:12:44.17,"know, kindred to one another 'cause we understood"

180,00:12:47.33,00:12:47.33,"Yeah, I have to say, I sighed a sigh of relief"
181,00:12:49.62,00:12:49.62,when I saw you 'cause I realized I wasn't gonna be the weirdest
182,00:12:53.83,00:12:53.83,one here. >> ( laughing )
183,00:12:54.62,00:12:54.62,>> I mean that in a loving way. >> I felt the same way.
184,00:12:56.71,00:12:56.71,"I was, like, ""Oh, we're gonna totally get along."""
185,00:12:58.71,00:12:58.71,>> You can tell that Angie and I are both cut from the same

189,00:13:09.33,00:13:09.33,"'cause if we're too much of an outcast,"
190,00:13:11.71,00:13:11.71,obviously it's gonna make us a target.
191,00:13:14.17,00:13:14.17,>> Now how do we get that up there?
192,00:13:17.33,00:13:17.33,"I don't know. Tom, what were"
193,00:13:18.79,00:13:18.79,you thinking with this? I got this up here.
194,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,"Actually, what we're gonna need is, we're gonna need somebody"
195,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50,to get up here to start putting
196,00:13:26.33,00:13:26.33,these cross pieces. >> The boys really
197,00:13:28.21,00:13:28.21,got together and they used... We used one big tree
198,00:13:30.88,00:13:30.88,"as our base for our shelter, and then they put reeds up,"
199,00:13:34.96,00:13:34.96,"and they said we needed to tie them at the top,"
200,00:13:37.58,00:13:37.58,"so I offered. >> Oh, my God."
201,00:13:42.46,00:13:42.46,"Nice job. >> Oh, watch it."
202,00:13:45.46,00:13:45.46,>> There you go. I'm loving you already.
203,00:13:48.21,00:13:48.21,>> Okay. I don't know if it was
204,00:13:50.92,00:13:50.92,"a good thing or bad thing, but I wanted to help"
205,00:13:52.62,00:13:52.62,and I figured my rock-climbing skills
206,00:13:54.17,00:13:54.17,"would help, so I climbed that had puppy like"
207,00:13:57.21,00:13:57.21,"a monkey and I did what I could. >> Come on, sucker."
208,00:14:01.96,00:14:01.96,>> Where's the sun? Beating down on me
209,00:14:04.21,00:14:04.21,"all day long. I think it is, like, 2:30."
210,00:14:08.04,00:14:08.04,Do you believe this? >> I know.
211,00:14:09.54,00:14:09.54,It's amazing. >> So what are you thinking?
212,00:14:12.58,00:14:12.58,"Ian, me, you? Just an early something here?"
213,00:14:17.12,00:14:17.12,"We might all be split tomorrow, but, uh...."
214,00:14:20.75,00:14:20.75,">> I'm in with that, with you guys,"
215,00:14:22.46,00:14:22.46,'cause we would be strong. The whole thing could
216,00:14:25.04,00:14:25.04,"be reshuffled, but... >> Yeah, absolutely."
217,00:14:26.79,00:14:26.79,>> Grasshoppers have protein. ( yelling ):
218,00:14:34.08,00:14:34.08,Wow! I just ate my first grasshopper!
219,00:14:37.33,00:14:37.33,"Oh, my God. Do you want to knock off"
220,00:14:43.79,00:14:43.79,"threats, or do you want to... You don't know how the game's"
221,00:14:46.12,00:14:46.12,"going to play out after that, right?"
222,00:14:47.67,00:14:47.67,>> Are you not leaning towards any of the girls?
223,00:14:51.00,00:14:51.00,">> Honestly, I'm not leaning towards anyone."
224,00:14:55.58,00:14:55.58,>> I'm leaning towards Jonathan. The one who jumped in the water.
225,00:15:00.75,00:15:00.75,>> Although he worked so hard today...
226,00:15:02.75,00:15:02.75,">> Everybody's working hard, really, when you look at it now,"
227,00:15:05.50,00:15:05.50,"I mean, in their own way. I'm just going"
228,00:15:07.29,00:15:07.29,with connections. I don't real connect with him.
229,00:15:10.04,00:15:10.04,I don't think I've said anything to him
230,00:15:11.54,00:15:11.54,the whole time I've been here. Honestly.
231,00:15:13.17,00:15:13.17,I don't think he's talked to me either.
232,00:15:15.08,00:15:15.08,Everybody's assumption at this point
233,00:15:18.17,00:15:18.17,is that we're all basically screwed
234,00:15:21.79,00:15:21.79,"because we all think we have Tribal Council, like, now."
235,00:15:24.25,00:15:24.25,>> We don't even know if we're going to be on the same team.
236,00:15:27.21,00:15:27.21,">> I know, but that's why you just got to go for today."
237,00:15:29.67,00:15:29.67,"Right, but that could change tomorrow."
238,00:15:31.17,00:15:31.17,>> So we thought we had three days of at least getting
239,00:15:33.25,00:15:33.25,"to know everybody, at least. You know, we don't know"
240,00:15:35.38,00:15:35.38,"if we have that, so everybody's security"
241,00:15:37.25,00:15:37.25,"has been blown, so everybody's freaking out."
242,00:15:40.12,00:15:40.12,>> Whoa! >> But I've definitely
243,00:15:42.71,00:15:42.71,"gone to different groups all day today and said, ""Who"
244,00:15:45.08,00:15:45.08,"are you going to vote for? ""Really? That's interesting."
245,00:15:48.04,00:15:48.04,"""What about voting for this person?"
246,00:15:49.88,00:15:49.88,"What about Jonathan? Hmm. Good."""
247,00:15:51.08,00:15:51.08,"And as long as I do it subtly... You go, boy."
248,00:15:55.21,00:15:55.21,"...and sneak it in there, you can change their minds,"
249,00:15:57.79,00:15:57.79,"'cause at this point, everybody doesn't want it to be them."
250,00:16:25.29,00:16:25.29,"Good morning, everybody. >> Good morning."
251,00:16:33.92,00:16:33.92,">> This one's cashed. >> PROBST: What's going on,"
252,00:16:37.50,00:16:37.50,"guys? >> Oh, hey, how you"
253,00:16:39.58,00:16:39.58,"doing there, Jeff? >> PROBST:  What's up?"
254,00:16:41.25,00:16:41.25,>> Here we go. >> We got visitors!
255,00:16:43.46,00:16:43.46,">> PROBST: What's up? >> Whoo, Jeff."
256,00:16:46.29,00:16:46.29,>> PROBST: How are you? How's everybody doing?
257,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,Big group. Anxious to know
258,00:16:52.71,00:16:52.71,what's happening? >> ALL: Yeah!
259,00:16:55.25,00:16:55.25,">> PROBST: All right, so Jolanda and Ian,"
260,00:16:57.00,00:16:57.00,you guys were the first two to the beach.
261,00:16:58.42,00:16:58.42,Who was the first person? >> Ian.
262,00:17:00.17,00:17:00.17,">> PROBST: Ian. All right, Ian,"
263,00:17:02.17,00:17:02.17,"take a spot right over here, Jolanda right over here."
264,00:17:04.21,00:17:04.21,Getting a little uncomfortable over here?
265,00:17:07.25,00:17:07.25,>> Yep. >> A little nervous now.
266,00:17:08.71,00:17:08.71,">> PROBST: How's that immunity feel, Jolanda?"
267,00:17:10.71,00:17:10.71,>> It feels good. >> PROBST: It ought to feel
268,00:17:12.71,00:17:12.71,real good. The immunity necklaces
269,00:17:15.50,00:17:15.50,that you're wearing guarantee that you're gonna
270,00:17:17.79,00:17:17.79,stay in this game for at least ten more minutes.
271,00:17:22.75,00:17:22.75,Which cannot be said for the other 18 of you.
272,00:17:28.04,00:17:28.04,We're gonna divide into two tribes
273,00:17:31.21,00:17:31.21,"with nine members each, that's 18 people."
274,00:17:34.08,00:17:34.08,There are 20 of you. Two people will not be selected
275,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,"to be on a tribe. Two people will get on a boat,"
276,00:17:43.96,00:17:43.96,"immediately, and be sent home. Ian and Jolanda you will make"
277,00:17:52.04,00:17:52.04,"the first picks, alternating between men and women."
278,00:17:54.79,00:17:54.79,"Each time you choose a person, that person will choose the"
279,00:17:56.54,00:17:56.54,"next member of the tribe. Ian, because were you first to"
280,00:18:00.42,00:18:00.42,"the beach, you will select first; you're picking a girl."
281,00:18:02.96,00:18:02.96,">> Okay. >> Uh, Katie."
282,00:18:09.42,00:18:09.42,">> PROBST: Jolanda, you're picking a guy."
283,00:18:14.75,00:18:14.75,>> Bobby Jon. >> Good choice.
284,00:18:21.58,00:18:21.58,">> PROBST: So, Ian and Jolanda, your work is done."
285,00:18:23.38,00:18:23.38,The person you pick will now pick.
286,00:18:25.12,00:18:25.12,"Katie, you're picking a guy. >> Tom."
287,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17,>> PROBST: Bobby. >> Stephenie.
288,00:18:42.42,00:18:42.42,">> PROBST: Tom, you're picking a woman."

291,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,">> Jeff. >> PROBST: Jeff, gonna make it"
292,00:19:00.67,00:19:00.67,"to at least the first challenge. Janu, you're picking a man."
293,00:19:11.25,00:19:11.25,">> Gregg. >> PROBST: Janu, you look upset."
294,00:19:21.92,00:19:21.92,">> No, it's just kind of weird. >> PROBST: Kind of weird?"
295,00:19:24.71,00:19:24.71,"You don't do this a lot? Jeff, you're picking a girl."
296,00:19:31.29,00:19:31.29,>> Kim. >> PROBST: Kim stays in the
297,00:19:34.08,00:19:34.08,"game. Gregg, you're picking a woman."
298,00:19:45.38,00:19:45.38,">> Jenn. >> PROBST: Kim, you're picking"
299,00:19:53.46,00:19:53.46,a guy. >> James.
300,00:20:01.25,00:20:01.25,">> PROBST: Jenn, you're picking a guy, tough decision."
301,00:20:04.25,00:20:04.25,Getting down to it. >> Uh...
302,00:20:11.25,00:20:11.25,Coby. >> PROBST: James.
303,00:20:18.17,00:20:18.17,">> Ashlee. >> PROBST: Coby, you're"
304,00:20:24.92,00:20:24.92,picking a woman. >> Caryn.
305,00:20:35.21,00:20:35.21,">> PROBST: Caryn, how does that feel to be standing over there?"
306,00:20:37.71,00:20:37.71,What's going through your head?
307,00:20:39.04,00:20:39.04,"It's not a good feeling, Jeff."
308,00:20:40.96,00:20:40.96,"It's better to be on this side. >> PROBST: Ashlee,"
309,00:20:43.96,00:20:43.96,you're picking a guy. >> Ibrehem.
310,00:20:58.92,00:20:58.92,>> PROBST: You each have one pick left.
311,00:21:01.21,00:21:01.21,"You're gonna pick one guy, gonna pick one girl."
312,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,"In doing so, you're gonna pick the final members of your tribe"
313,00:21:07.08,00:21:07.08,and effectively vote out two people from this game.
314,00:21:10.58,00:21:10.58,"How you feeling, Wanda? >> It's been an awful long time"
315,00:21:13.54,00:21:13.54,since my heart pounded this fast.
316,00:21:16.21,00:21:16.21,">> PROBST: Jonathan, how you feeling?"
317,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,>> I'm just... My heart's beating.
318,00:21:20.12,00:21:20.12,I thought I was gonna be picked before this.
319,00:21:24.50,00:21:24.50,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to make the final selections."
320,00:21:29.25,00:21:29.25,"Caryn, you're picking a guy. Make your decision."
321,00:21:40.46,00:21:40.46,>> Willard. >> PROBST: Willard stays in the
322,00:21:43.62,00:21:43.62,"game, Jonathan is out of the game."
323,00:21:50.92,00:21:50.92,"Ibrehem, you're picking a woman. Make your decision."
324,00:21:58.67,00:21:58.67,>> Angie. >> PROBST: Angie stays in the
325,00:22:01.67,00:22:01.67,game. Wanda is out of the game.
326,00:22:12.67,00:22:12.67,"Tough to say, but, guys, it is time for you to go."
327,00:22:15.42,00:22:15.42,"Right past me, you got a boat waiting out here."
328,00:22:23.50,00:22:23.50,>> Go have some chips and salsa.
329,00:22:25.83,00:22:25.83,">> Go get it, Wanda. Go get it, John."
330,00:22:28.29,00:22:28.29,"Come on, now. >> I love you, too."
331,00:22:40.00,00:22:40.00,">> We love you, Wanda! >> Wanda, sing a song!"
332,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,>> Sing a song! >> \xe2\x99\xaa Survivors!
333,00:22:48.04,00:22:48.04,\xe2\x99\xaa We're going to be the survivors \xe2\x99\xaa
334,00:22:52.04,00:22:52.04,\xe2\x99\xaa We've got the energy and heroes we will be again! \xe2\x99\xaa
335,00:22:58.04,00:22:58.04,"Have a good one, guys. >> Bye!"
336,00:23:13.12,00:23:13.12,">> I was really, really, really sad."
337,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,But that's all right. I'm gonna wipe my tears
338,00:23:17.92,00:23:17.92,and refocus. That's in the past.
339,00:23:20.92,00:23:20.92,It's a whole new game. All right.
340,00:23:24.33,00:23:24.33,Let's hand out the buffs. ( cheering )
341,00:23:28.62,00:23:28.62,>> All right. >> PROBST: You guys are Ulong.
342,00:23:32.88,00:23:32.88,You wear blue. Your tribe-- Karor.
343,00:23:38.75,00:23:38.75,You will wear brown. Brown.
344,00:23:41.83,00:23:41.83,">> All right. >> PROBST: Okay, so you're now"
345,00:23:47.21,00:23:47.21,"two tribes-- Ulong, Karor. Two tribes still living"
346,00:23:50.12,00:23:50.12,together on the same beach. Head on back.
347,00:23:54.12,00:23:54.12,>> Get out of here. >> Are you serious?
348,00:23:57.04,00:23:57.04,( laughing ) >> That's the plan.
349,00:24:12.08,00:24:12.08,>> I really thought you're giving away the competition.
350,00:24:16.21,00:24:16.21,( laughing ) >> It's definitely going
351,00:24:20.29,00:24:20.29,"to be weird, all staying on one beach"
352,00:24:22.25,00:24:22.25,"together, though. It's still coming through,"
353,00:24:24.25,00:24:24.25,"though. >> It hurts to be last, but..."
354,00:24:27.12,00:24:27.12,">> Oh, yeah. I felt horrible"
355,00:24:30.46,00:24:30.46,being picked last. I didn't think that I was going
356,00:24:32.54,00:24:32.54,"to be picked last. >> How many girls we have, five?"
357,00:24:35.21,00:24:35.21,>> I thought 100% that Coby was going to pick me.
358,00:24:39.08,00:24:39.08,>> Five and four. >> Five and four.
359,00:24:41.67,00:24:41.67,"I don't feel like I'm on the tribe that I should be on,"
360,00:24:44.62,00:24:44.62,so there's no kindred feelings with my tribe.
361,00:24:47.08,00:24:47.08,I'm the odd man out. >> Never had anything
362,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,"against you, ever. >> Guys, if there's any sort"
363,00:24:55.25,00:24:55.25,of competition that they are trying to put
364,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,"into this game already, let's not be the ones"
365,00:25:00.08,00:25:00.08,"that start into that. >> No, no, no."
366,00:25:01.54,00:25:01.54,>> Our average age is higher. but let's try to weaken them
367,00:25:04.33,00:25:04.33,when it comes to physical stuff. >> I'm altogether
368,00:25:07.17,00:25:07.17,"very, very happy. I wanted a wise tribe, if I had"
369,00:25:10.12,00:25:10.12,the opportunity to pick. We got a little bit of the
370,00:25:12.75,00:25:12.75,"older folks, which I really like, and we're up against a"
371,00:25:15.08,00:25:15.08,bunch of the young bucks. You compare the tribes and you
372,00:25:17.92,00:25:17.92,see a definite difference. They come to you
373,00:25:19.08,00:25:19.08,"and say, oh, listen, so and so on your team"
374,00:25:21.04,00:25:21.04,was talking about you... they are just trying
375,00:25:23.17,00:25:23.17,to break us up. >> I love everybody
376,00:25:24.96,00:25:24.96,on this team. >> We definitely have
377,00:25:26.75,00:25:26.75,"some kind of advantage, which I don't care"
378,00:25:28.75,00:25:28.75,"what you say, you know, smart's in it, too, but"
379,00:25:31.21,00:25:31.21,"athletics is going to play a part in it, also."
380,00:25:38.79,00:25:38.79,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. You guys ready to get"
381,00:25:49.33,00:25:49.33,to the challenge? >> ALL: Yeah.
382,00:25:51.21,00:25:51.21,>> PROBST: It is both reward and immunity.
383,00:25:52.96,00:25:52.96,Here's how it works. Both tribes are going
384,00:25:55.46,00:25:55.46,to compete head-to-head in a jungle obstacle course.
385,00:25:58.58,00:25:58.58,You'll make your way through a net maze
386,00:26:01.04,00:26:01.04,and then through a series of tires.
387,00:26:02.62,00:26:02.62,"You'll reach a covered supply dump, where you will find"
388,00:26:05.25,00:26:05.25,a set of paddles you must take tied
389,00:26:07.62,00:26:07.62,to four survival items you can choose
390,00:26:10.25,00:26:10.25,"to take or leave behind. Fire in the form of flint,"
391,00:26:13.58,00:26:13.58,"two cans to carry water, flour and rice for your food"
392,00:26:17.25,00:26:17.25,"and a tarp for shelter, but the crates"
393,00:26:19.75,00:26:19.75,that these items are in have been weighted to make them
394,00:26:22.54,00:26:22.54,"very heavy to carry. Untie all of your items,"
395,00:26:25.25,00:26:25.25,continue through the course carrying the items.
396,00:26:27.75,00:26:27.75,"You'll go up and over a wall, through a jungle swamp."
397,00:26:31.54,00:26:31.54,"When you reach your canoe, drop the items you chose"
398,00:26:33.79,00:26:33.79,"to take with you, get in the canoe,"
399,00:26:35.62,00:26:35.62,paddle out to retrieve a flag and race back to shore.
400,00:26:38.62,00:26:38.62,The first tribe to get back to their mat
401,00:26:40.33,00:26:40.33,with all nine tribe members and their tribe-colored flag
402,00:26:42.67,00:26:42.67,"wins immunity and all the items they carried to that mat,"
403,00:26:46.67,00:26:46.67,keeping in mind you can only win the items that make it
404,00:26:49.54,00:26:49.54,"all the way to the finish. So, it becomes a choice."
405,00:26:52.42,00:26:52.42,"You want to win to guarantee yourself immunity,"
406,00:26:55.25,00:26:55.25,but you want to win with as many items as possible.
407,00:26:58.88,00:26:58.88,"Now let's get to immunity. Ian, Jolanda,"
408,00:27:01.21,00:27:01.21,"you can you take those off. Like I said, those guaranteed"
409,00:27:03.67,00:27:03.67,you'd stay in the game ten more minutes.
410,00:27:05.79,00:27:05.79,Those ten minutes are over. This is what you covet now.
411,00:27:11.96,00:27:11.96,Immunity-- the only thing that keeps you safe in this game
412,00:27:15.54,00:27:15.54,"is this. As long as you have it,"
413,00:27:17.25,00:27:17.25,you can't be voted out. Take your spots
414,00:27:19.42,00:27:19.42,and wait for my go. Here we go.
415,00:27:25.08,00:27:25.08,"For immunity and reward. Survivors, ready..."
416,00:27:29.04,00:27:29.04,Go! Tom with a big head start.
417,00:27:36.62,00:27:36.62,Neck and neck right now. Tom the first one over
418,00:27:43.12,00:27:43.12,"for Koror, followed by Gregg."
419,00:27:45.67,00:27:45.67,"Here comes Jeff for Ulong. >> Come on, come on, come on!"
420,00:27:50.21,00:27:50.21,>> PROBST: There's Ian for Koror.
421,00:27:52.21,00:27:52.21,We're tight. There's Jenn.
422,00:27:54.46,00:27:54.46,Koror got a bit of a lead. Here comes Caryn for Ulong.
423,00:27:57.92,00:27:57.92,Ulong in one fell swoop catches up.
424,00:28:03.12,00:28:03.12,">> Come on, let's go, guys! >> PROBST: Ulong moving on."
425,00:28:06.88,00:28:06.88,"Koror, go! Up and over, however you want."
426,00:28:18.29,00:28:18.29,Neck and neck still. >> Come on!
427,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,>> PROBST: Start pulling those off.
428,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,You gotta move all your items to the mat before you can
429,00:28:24.17,00:28:24.17,"start untying them. >> Let's go, guys."
430,00:28:27.12,00:28:27.12,">> PROBST: Get that last item, Koror."
431,00:28:30.29,00:28:30.29,"Ulong, start untying. This is where you"
432,00:28:33.54,00:28:33.54,make your first decision. Are you going to take
433,00:28:35.83,00:28:35.83,all your items or not. Koror working together well.
434,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,"Koror, very close. Koror is free."
435,00:28:47.33,00:28:47.33,"Koror is leaving their food and their water,"
436,00:28:51.71,00:28:51.71,taking only their fire with them.
437,00:28:54.75,00:28:54.75,">> You guys, come on! We gotta go."
438,00:28:57.21,00:28:57.21,">> We're gonna lose. >> I'm telling you,"
439,00:29:04.88,00:29:04.88,"I think we should go. You guys, finish it up."
440,00:29:08.12,00:29:08.12,"We gotta go. >> Oh, my God."
441,00:29:10.25,00:29:10.25,">> PROBST: Ulong, keep it moving."
442,00:29:15.17,00:29:15.17,Koror first to the wall. >> Two people push me
443,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17,"up that wall. One, two, three."
444,00:29:23.54,00:29:23.54,">> Come on! >> This way, this way."
445,00:29:27.17,00:29:27.17,">> Come on! You got it, Ulong!"
446,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,>> Get out of the way. Ahh!
447,00:29:32.25,00:29:32.25,No... >> Try jumping down.
448,00:29:36.04,00:29:36.04,>> PROBST: Here comes Ulong right on your tail.
449,00:29:37.58,00:29:37.58,Koror having trouble getting Willard over.
450,00:29:40.17,00:29:40.17,"Ulong brought food and water, did not bring fire."
451,00:29:45.12,00:29:45.12,Interesting strategy. Koror is up and over.
452,00:29:51.58,00:29:51.58,"Koror, go.  Ulong really struggling."
453,00:29:56.92,00:29:56.92,Koror making their way through the swamp
454,00:30:00.25,00:30:00.25,with a big lead. ( grunts and groans )
455,00:30:03.83,00:30:03.83,Ulong finally over the wall. Koror first to their canoe.
456,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,"The strategy was to only bring fire,"
457,00:30:12.04,00:30:12.04,and it's working so far. Paddle out.
458,00:30:15.25,00:30:15.25,Get your flag. Come on.
459,00:30:19.25,00:30:19.25,">> PROBST: Let's go, Ulong!"
460,00:30:21.92,00:30:21.92,Keep it moving. You're still in this.
461,00:30:24.25,00:30:24.25,"Get in, get in. The rest up front."
462,00:30:27.04,00:30:27.04,"Ulong, go. Paddle out."
463,00:30:31.71,00:30:31.71,"Hustle up, guys. Good paddlers might"
464,00:30:35.25,00:30:35.25,be able to catch them. >> Get to that side.
465,00:30:41.17,00:30:41.17,Right side paddle backwards. >> To the right side!
466,00:30:44.50,00:30:44.50,>> Paddle faster. >> Paddle on the right.
467,00:30:47.62,00:30:47.62,>> PROBST: Koror still with a big with a big lead.
468,00:30:51.46,00:30:51.46,>> Left to right side. You'll get taken off to do it.
469,00:30:54.71,00:30:54.71,"Right side. >> That's good,"
470,00:30:55.79,00:30:55.79,"that's good. All right, now listen,"
471,00:30:57.96,00:30:57.96,both sides. >> Turn it around.
472,00:31:00.58,00:31:00.58,">> We're going the wrong way. >> PROBST: Ulong,"
473,00:31:03.12,00:31:03.12,the flag is that way. ( indistinct shouting )
474,00:31:09.33,00:31:09.33,">> Guys, let's freakin' paddle! Ulong is looking for"
475,00:31:13.58,00:31:13.58,another island. >> Go. Go.
476,00:31:19.46,00:31:19.46,">> PROBST: Koror working together, straight,"
477,00:31:24.25,00:31:24.25,"strong, fast. >> Come on!"
478,00:31:29.04,00:31:29.04,Come on! >> Come on!
479,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,>> PROBST: Ulong having a heck of a time paddling.
480,00:31:34.75,00:31:34.75,>> Too many people on one side. >> PROBST: Frustration setting
481,00:31:37.12,00:31:37.12,in for Ulong. >> We're going to get it.
482,00:31:42.62,00:31:42.62,( whooping ) >> Whoo!
483,00:31:50.46,00:31:50.46,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: Koror wins immunity
484,00:31:52.54,00:31:52.54,and reward! >> Yeah!
485,00:31:58.25,00:31:58.25,( whooping ) >> Good strategy.
486,00:32:07.67,00:32:07.67,">> PROBST: All right, Koror, nice strategy."
487,00:32:09.67,00:32:09.67,You chose to only bring fire. You can boil water with that.
488,00:32:14.71,00:32:14.71,"You can cook food with that. Okay, here's immunity."
489,00:32:18.00,00:32:18.00,"Yes, yes, yes! You are safe from"
490,00:32:22.58,00:32:22.58,the vote tonight. One other decision.
491,00:32:24.17,00:32:24.17,"Because you won, you get a choice."
492,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,The two tribes will no longer be living together on one beach.
493,00:32:32.08,00:32:32.08,You can either go back to what you know
494,00:32:35.12,00:32:35.12,"and the shelter you help build,"
495,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,or this is a map to a new unknown beach
496,00:32:39.79,00:32:39.79,where you can start fresh. >> But why see a beach
497,00:32:43.79,00:32:43.79,we already saw? Let's go see something new.
498,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,>> New adventure. >> PROBST: You're going
499,00:32:49.12,00:32:49.12,to take your chances. >> We'll take our chances.
500,00:32:51.92,00:32:51.92,>> PROBST: Give up what you know for the unknown.
501,00:32:53.08,00:32:53.08,">> Yes, we are. >> PROBST: Here's your map"
502,00:32:54.54,00:32:54.54,to your new home. >> Yeah!
503,00:32:57.21,00:32:57.21,">> PROBST: Ulong, good news is, you're going home."
504,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,You're taking your outrigger canoe with you.
505,00:33:02.58,00:33:02.58,"Bad news is, you're get some much-needed"
506,00:33:05.12,00:33:05.12,practice when you paddle to Tribal Council tonight
507,00:33:07.71,00:33:07.71,and officially vote out the first member.
508,00:33:10.04,00:33:10.04,"Get your stuff, head on out. >> After the challenge,"
509,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,"we were so excited. We won immunity,"
510,00:33:28.67,00:33:28.67,and we won the stuff that we needed to make fire.
511,00:33:31.21,00:33:31.21,We were so the underdog. Winning that was huge for us.
512,00:33:42.25,00:33:42.25,"( indistinct chatter ) This wave came,"
513,00:33:53.42,00:33:53.42,and we went over. I don't know what the deal was
514,00:33:56.75,00:33:56.75,"with, you know, who was leaning what way"
515,00:33:58.83,00:33:58.83,"or what, but I think it was just a combination"
516,00:34:00.71,00:34:00.71,"of all forces, and we just went down."
517,00:34:02.54,00:34:02.54,All of the supplies to make fire
518,00:34:04.88,00:34:04.88,were in this heavy steel container
519,00:34:06.96,00:34:06.96,"that went straight down. It was just like,"
520,00:34:10.29,00:34:10.29,"did this really happen? >> I thought I saw something,"
521,00:34:15.08,00:34:15.08,"but hell, I don't know. It may be right there."
522,00:34:17.62,00:34:17.62,">> We were so elated the ride back in the canoe,"
523,00:34:20.12,00:34:20.12,we were just loving life and couldn't wait
524,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,"to see the new beach. And all this to happen,"
525,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,"we're just crushed right now. And we don't have the water,"
526,00:34:28.08,00:34:28.08,we don't have the flint to start a fire to boil
527,00:34:30.58,00:34:30.58,the water and purify it. We lost everything we won today.
528,00:34:34.25,00:34:34.25,We're in a worse scenario than we originally had.
529,00:34:51.17,00:34:51.17,">> We lost to the challenge, and we lost pretty hard."
530,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,The other tribe outplayed us and outwitted us completely.
531,00:34:58.12,00:34:58.12,"You know what, we didn't make smart decisions."
532,00:35:00.33,00:35:00.33,"They were smart, they took just the fire."
533,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,>> The coconuts will sustain us for 39 days if we had to.
534,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,So understand that-- I'm not going to allow
535,00:35:09.12,00:35:09.12,anyone to be negative. >> Nobody needs to be negative.
536,00:35:11.88,00:35:11.88,">> Okay. No, no, about, ""Oh, we don't have this."
537,00:35:13.21,00:35:13.21,"We got everything we need."" >> I know how things work."
538,00:35:15.58,00:35:15.58,"I'm not the strongest person. You know, people are gonna"
539,00:35:19.12,00:35:19.12,choose who doesn't fit into this and who they think
540,00:35:22.08,00:35:22.08,is a weak link. So I definitely think
541,00:35:24.83,00:35:24.83,that I am a target. >> But when it comes
542,00:35:30.54,00:35:30.54,"to challenges, physically, I know I'm stronger"
543,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,"than most of their dudes. Well, let's keep on"
544,00:35:35.88,00:35:35.88,what we was doing. We're gonna do Angie...
545,00:35:37.42,00:35:37.42,>> Right. We're gonna do Angie. But we got to get
546,00:35:39.46,00:35:39.46,"the other guys to go in on it. I want to go talk to Stephenie,"
547,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,"'cause we have issues. If we have issues,"
548,00:35:44.75,00:35:44.75,we need to work them out. >> My vote will be for Angie
549,00:35:48.62,00:35:48.62,"not because I don't like her, but she is a person that"
550,00:35:51.21,00:35:51.21,must be voted off in order for our team
551,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,to be as strong as it can be. >> So you think Angie.
552,00:35:58.79,00:35:58.79,>> I think we need to keep the men.
553,00:36:00.42,00:36:00.42,I think it's absolutely... >> We're keeping the men.
554,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"We can't lose any of our guys. Which, I mean, seriously, I"
555,00:36:04.79,00:36:04.79,"mean, I-I could be voted off. I don't want to be voted off."
556,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,I think the team needs me. >> We need your strength.
557,00:36:10.92,00:36:10.92,"But I do have to say, we should've left earlier."
558,00:36:13.21,00:36:13.21,"Yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right."
559,00:36:14.79,00:36:14.79,"I know that you're just a complete go-getter,"
560,00:36:17.46,00:36:17.46,"and that's why you want us to get everything,"
561,00:36:19.33,00:36:19.33,and I understand that. So I guess Angie.
562,00:36:21.50,00:36:21.50,">> Okay. >> Okay. You, too."
563,00:36:23.33,00:36:23.33,>> Absolutely. >> Okay.
564,00:36:26.71,00:36:26.71,Nervous as hell about Tribal. Wish I wasn't going tonight.
565,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,"We made a dumb mistake, and I don't think"
566,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,"we should be going tonight. But we are, and it's because"
567,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"of one person, I feel. The only reason"
568,00:36:41.46,00:36:41.46,we lost the challenge 'cause we didn't
569,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,leave soon enough. >> We didn't leave soon enough.
570,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,>> She wanted everything. I don't think
571,00:36:46.54,00:36:46.54,we need to get rid of her. I'm not gonna vote for her.
572,00:36:48.71,00:36:48.71,Stephenie's thinking that Jolanda's the reason
573,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"we lost the challenge. But that woman's got a lot,"
574,00:36:54.12,00:36:54.12,a lot of strength. I think she can still
575,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,help us out. I haven't seen where
576,00:36:58.75,00:36:58.75,she's hurting us just yet. >> Who do you want to vote for?
577,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,>> I think Angie right now. >> She's not fit?
578,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,">> Yeah, yeah. >> All right."
579,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,"Well, I don't know, I'm sorry. ( laughs )"
580,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,">> No, that's good, that's good. >> I'll go with you."
581,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,">> Okay, news flash, news flash."
582,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,This is something that I noticed.
583,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"For every two hours, that we work, we're gonna rest"
584,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,"for at least an hour, okay? It is time for us to get"
585,00:37:24.58,00:37:24.58,"focused, kick butt and take names."
586,00:37:26.96,00:37:26.96,>> Jolanda is a strong personality.
587,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,She is not a team player. I didn't know that
588,00:37:33.92,00:37:33.92,that's how you guys felt. >> Right.
589,00:37:35.92,00:37:35.92,>> I thought I was the only one. Are you down with that?
590,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,Are you in? >> Yeah.
591,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,>> Because I'll be pissed if everybody changes their mind.
592,00:37:41.92,00:37:41.92,"I mean, I'll hold it against you for life."
593,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,">> Now she says, ""We're voting out Jo."
594,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,"Are you in?"" I was, like,"
595,00:37:47.75,00:37:47.75,"""Hell, yeah, I'm in."" Like, I'm thinking"
596,00:37:49.71,00:37:49.71,"I'm the one out, like I know how today went."
597,00:37:52.29,00:37:52.29,You don't think I remember exactly the order
598,00:37:55.29,00:37:55.29,in which we got picked for tribes?
599,00:37:57.54,00:37:57.54,I don't trust anyone in this tribe.
600,00:38:00.17,00:38:00.17,"But if I can at least make it past this one,"
601,00:38:02.04,00:38:02.04,I'll be happy. >> PROBST: Behind each of you
602,00:38:30.04,00:38:30.04,is a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch.
603,00:38:32.42,00:38:32.42,"Approach a flame, dip it in and get fire."
604,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,This is part of the ritual of Tribal Council.
605,00:38:40.71,00:38:40.71,"In this game, fire represents your life."
606,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
607,00:38:45.29,00:38:45.29,"When your fire's gone, so are you."
608,00:38:47.17,00:38:47.17,"Have a seat. Well, welcome to your first"
609,00:38:53.79,00:38:53.79,Tribal Council. I know you don't want
610,00:38:56.58,00:38:56.58,"to be here. Stephenie,"
611,00:38:58.08,00:38:58.08,what's been the biggest surprise first three days?
612,00:39:00.08,00:39:00.08,">> Biggest surprise? Oh, God."
613,00:39:02.75,00:39:02.75,"Starving, we can't get fire,"
614,00:39:05.75,00:39:05.75,"we're so thirsty. We were together as one,"
615,00:39:08.00,00:39:08.00,"and now we're separated, we've formed bonds"
616,00:39:09.83,00:39:09.83,"and now they're gone, and we don't know"
617,00:39:12.88,00:39:12.88,what's coming next. It's been really tough.
618,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,>> PROBST: James. Happy with this tribe?
619,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,>> I am. This is a damn fine tribe.
620,00:39:21.25,00:39:21.25,"Everybody in here is tough, they're young, they"
621,00:39:23.96,00:39:23.96,"got a lot of energy, lot of testosterone."
622,00:39:27.33,00:39:27.33,We gonna win some matches. We just didn't do it today.
623,00:39:32.38,00:39:32.38,">> PROBST: Jeff, let's talk about the strategy"
624,00:39:34.88,00:39:34.88,"of today's challenge, because it was about"
625,00:39:37.50,00:39:37.50,making a choice. And it seems as though
626,00:39:40.25,00:39:40.25,"you guys have a very strong tribe,"
627,00:39:42.92,00:39:42.92,but it was brains that beat you today.
628,00:39:45.04,00:39:45.04,Would you agree? >> Yeah.
629,00:39:46.75,00:39:46.75,"We've got the strength, we all have the endurance."
630,00:39:49.25,00:39:49.25,There was just a couple key times
631,00:39:51.21,00:39:51.21,"that we just messed up, and, you know,"
632,00:39:53.04,00:39:53.04,we lost time trying to get everything
633,00:39:54.88,00:39:54.88,"we possibly could and get running with it,"
634,00:39:57.62,00:39:57.62,"and... it wasn't gonna happen. >> PROBST: So, James,"
635,00:40:00.67,00:40:00.67,let me be clear. You didn't even bring fire.
636,00:40:03.46,00:40:03.46,"Oh, hell, no. We should've."
637,00:40:05.46,00:40:05.46,You did not take fire? >> Dumb-ass.
638,00:40:08.12,00:40:08.12,">> Well, we tried to get it, but it was last,"
639,00:40:10.33,00:40:10.33,and then when we realized that we just lost a tremendous
640,00:40:13.46,00:40:13.46,"amount of time, we just said, okay,"
641,00:40:15.12,00:40:15.12,"just take the other stuff. >> PROBST: Ashlee, is there a"
642,00:40:17.46,00:40:17.46,"leader on this tribe yet? >> Jeff, I think that is..."
643,00:40:20.96,00:40:20.96,"the only thing that's holding this group back,"
644,00:40:24.04,00:40:24.04,is that we have yet to come together as a group
645,00:40:28.17,00:40:28.17,and decide who is gonna lead our group right now.
646,00:40:31.25,00:40:31.25,">> PROBST: Jolanda, can this group lead itself..."
647,00:40:33.25,00:40:33.25,"as a group? >> Uh, no."
648,00:40:35.83,00:40:35.83,We need somebody to make a unilateral decision.
649,00:40:38.88,00:40:38.88,"I mean, I would like, if I could,"
650,00:40:40.83,00:40:40.83,to help lead the team. But I also know that I have
651,00:40:43.71,00:40:43.71,"a very strong personality. So, that's been"
652,00:40:45.33,00:40:45.33,"my biggest dilemma, because I don't want"
653,00:40:47.88,00:40:47.88,"for people to say, ""Oh, you know,"
654,00:40:49.29,00:40:49.29,"""her personality's too strong, she's bossy,"
655,00:40:51.75,00:40:51.75,"she's a... a witch."" >> PROBST: Angie, picked last,"
656,00:40:55.54,00:40:55.54,"tribe welcomes you, but now here we are"
657,00:40:58.21,00:40:58.21,"at Tribal Council, and you were still picked last."
658,00:41:01.04,00:41:01.04,>> Yep. >> PROBST: How heavy is that
659,00:41:02.17,00:41:02.17,weighing on your mind? Or have you overcome that?
660,00:41:05.58,00:41:05.58,">> It weighs very heavy on my mind. I mean, it's hard"
661,00:41:09.17,00:41:09.17,being picked last. But I think that I tried
662,00:41:12.04,00:41:12.04,"really, really hard at the challenge today,"
663,00:41:13.88,00:41:13.88,"but I think definitely, my head was gonna be"
664,00:41:16.50,00:41:16.50,"on the chopping block. You know, either there's"
665,00:41:18.58,00:41:18.58,some things going on where somebody has
666,00:41:21.00,00:41:21.00,"somebody else in mind, or it's just..."
667,00:41:23.12,00:41:23.12,"it's gonna overwhelmingly be me, so..."
668,00:41:26.67,00:41:26.67,>> PROBST: We'll find out. It is time to vote.
669,00:41:28.62,00:41:28.62,"Jolanda, you're up. >> Um, Angie,"
670,00:41:41.62,00:41:41.62,I just don't think that we can be happy with losses.
671,00:41:44.38,00:41:44.38,We've got to evaluate and move forward.
672,00:42:18.25,00:42:18.25,">> ( whispers ): It's nothing personal,"
673,00:42:20.25,00:42:20.25,"but it's either you or I, and I don't want it to be me."
674,00:42:30.29,00:42:30.29,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
675,00:42:44.96,00:42:44.96,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
676,00:42:46.83,00:42:46.83,The person voted out will be asked to leave the
677,00:42:48.38,00:42:48.38,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
678,00:42:52.71,00:42:52.71,First vote. Angie.
679,00:43:00.21,00:43:00.21,"Jolanda-- one vote Angie, one vote Jolanda."
680,00:43:06.17,00:43:06.17,"Angie-- two votes Angie, one vote Jolanda."
681,00:43:13.21,00:43:13.21,"Angie. That's three votes Angie,"
682,00:43:15.42,00:43:15.42,one vote Jolanda. Jolanda.
683,00:43:20.58,00:43:20.58,"Three votes Angie, two votes Jolanda."
684,00:43:26.08,00:43:26.08,"Jolanda. We're tied: three votes Angie,"
685,00:43:30.42,00:43:30.42,three votes Jolanda. That's four votes Jolanda.
686,00:43:39.29,00:43:39.29,First person voted out of Survivor: Palau--
687,00:43:42.38,00:43:42.38,"Jolanda. That's five votes,"
688,00:43:44.25,00:43:44.25,that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
689,00:43:48.88,00:43:48.88,">> Good luck, you guys. Watch the way."
690,00:43:56.67,00:43:56.67,">> PROBST: Jolanda, the tribe has spoken."
691,00:44:00.71,00:44:00.71,"It's time for you to go. Well, if there's one thing"
692,00:44:17.54,00:44:17.54,"you should take away from tonight's Tribal Council,"
693,00:44:20.25,00:44:20.25,it should be this: You need to stop
694,00:44:22.29,00:44:22.29,"with the excuses and get a plan, or you will"
695,00:44:25.00,00:44:25.00,be back here very soon. You're not gonna be going
696,00:44:27.38,00:44:27.38,back to camp with fire; you're gonna
697,00:44:29.12,00:44:29.12,earn that on your own. Go back to camp. Good night.
698,00:44:45.58,00:44:45.58,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
699,00:44:52.00,00:44:52.00,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
700,00:44:53.62,00:44:53.62,"( woman screams ) >> Oh, my God, there were three!"
701,00:44:56.46,00:44:56.46,"( thunderclap ) >> Oh, no!"
702,00:44:59.08,00:44:59.08,>> PROBST: ...Koror questions the move to the new beach.
703,00:45:01.04,00:45:01.04,>> Do you think there could be a worse
704,00:45:02.83,00:45:02.83,"island than this? >> PROBST: At Ulong,"
705,00:45:04.12,00:45:04.12,"Jeff and Kim get cozy, and the search"
706,00:45:07.17,00:45:07.17,for flint intensifies. >> Fire is the only thing
707,00:45:10.67,00:45:10.67,"that matters. >> I played this game,"
708,00:45:17.12,00:45:17.12,and I don't think that I would do
709,00:45:19.12,00:45:19.12,"anything differently. I mean, I am the oldest,"
710,00:45:21.29,00:45:21.29,and I think differently than my tribe.
711,00:45:23.42,00:45:23.42,"They are a lot more happy-go-lucky than I am,"
712,00:45:26.29,00:45:26.29,"but that's fine, because this was a great adventure,"
713,00:45:29.75,00:45:29.75,"and it's an experience that I think everyone should try,"
714,00:45:33.12,00:45:33.12,and I don't regret anything that happened out here.
