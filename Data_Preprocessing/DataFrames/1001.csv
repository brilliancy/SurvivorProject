526,00:34:30.58,00:34:30.58,the water and purify it.We lost everything we won today.
527,00:34:34.25,00:34:34.25,We're in a worse scenariothan we originally had.

539,00:35:22.08,00:35:22.08,is a weak link.So I definitely think
540,00:35:24.83,00:35:24.83,that I am a target.>> But when it comes
541,00:35:30.54,00:35:30.54,"to challenges, physically,I know I'm stronger"
542,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,"than most of their dudes.Well, let's keep on"
543,00:35:35.88,00:35:35.88,what we was doing.We're gonna do Angie...
544,00:35:37.42,00:35:37.42,>> Right. We're gonna do Angie.But we got to get
545,00:35:39.46,00:35:39.46,"the other guys to go in on it.I want to go talk to Stephenie,"
546,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,"'cause we have issues.If we have issues,"
547,00:35:44.75,00:35:44.75,we need to work them out.>> My vote will be for Angie
548,00:35:48.62,00:35:48.62,"not because I don't like her,but she is a person that"
549,00:35:51.21,00:35:51.21,must be voted offin order for our team
550,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,to be as strong as it can be.>> So you think Angie.
551,00:35:58.79,00:35:58.79,>> I think we needto keep the men.
552,00:36:00.42,00:36:00.42,I think it's absolutely...>> We're keeping the men.
553,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"We can't lose any of our guys.Which, I mean, seriously, I"
554,00:36:04.79,00:36:04.79,"mean, I-I could be voted off.I don't want to be voted off."
555,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,I think the team needs me.>> We need your strength.
556,00:36:10.92,00:36:10.92,"But I do have to say,we should've left earlier."
557,00:36:13.21,00:36:13.21,"Yeah, you're right,you're right, you're right."
558,00:36:14.79,00:36:14.79,"I know that you're justa complete go-getter,"
559,00:36:17.46,00:36:17.46,"and that's why you want usto get everything,"
560,00:36:19.33,00:36:19.33,and I understand that.So I guess Angie.
561,00:36:21.50,00:36:21.50,">> Okay.>> Okay. You, too."
562,00:36:23.33,00:36:23.33,>> Absolutely.>> Okay.
563,00:36:26.71,00:36:26.71,Nervous as hell about Tribal.Wish I wasn't going tonight.
564,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,"We made a dumb mistake,and I don't think"
565,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,"we should be going tonight.But we are, and it's because"
566,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"of one person, I feel.The only reason"
567,00:36:41.46,00:36:41.46,we lost the challenge'cause we didn't
568,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,leave soon enough.>> We didn't leave soon enough.
569,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,>> She wanted everything.I don't think
570,00:36:46.54,00:36:46.54,we need to get rid of her.I'm not gonna vote for her.
571,00:36:48.71,00:36:48.71,Stephenie's thinkingthat Jolanda's the reason
572,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"we lost the challenge.But that woman's got a lot,"
573,00:36:54.12,00:36:54.12,a lot of strength.I think she can still
574,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,help us out.I haven't seen where
575,00:36:58.75,00:36:58.75,she's hurting us just yet.>> Who do you want to vote for?
576,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,>> I think Angie right now.>> She's not fit?
577,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,">> Yeah, yeah.>> All right."

580,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,">> Okay, news flash, newsflash."
581,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,This is somethingthat I noticed.
582,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"For every two hours, that wework, we're gonna rest"
583,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,"for at least an hour, okay?It is time for us to get"
584,00:37:24.58,00:37:24.58,"focused, kick buttand take names."
585,00:37:26.96,00:37:26.96,>> Jolanda is a strongpersonality.
586,00:37:30.58,00:37:30.58,She is not a team player.I didn't know that
587,00:37:33.92,00:37:33.92,that's how you guys felt.>> Right.
588,00:37:35.92,00:37:35.92,>> I thought I was the only one.Are you down with that?
589,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,Are you in?>> Yeah.

597,00:37:55.29,00:37:55.29,in which we got pickedfor tribes?
598,00:37:57.54,00:37:57.54,I don't trust anyonein this tribe.
599,00:38:00.17,00:38:00.17,"But if I can at leastmake it past this one,"
600,00:38:02.04,00:38:02.04,I'll be happy.>> PROBST: Behind each of you

603,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,This is part of the ritualof Tribal Council.
604,00:38:40.71,00:38:40.71,"In this game,fire represents your life."
605,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,"As long as you have fire,you're still in the game."
606,00:38:45.29,00:38:45.29,"When your fire's gone,so are you."
607,00:38:47.17,00:38:47.17,"Have a seat.Well, welcome to your first"

612,00:39:02.75,00:39:02.75,"Starving,we can't get fire,"
613,00:39:05.75,00:39:05.75,"we're so thirsty.We were together as one,"
614,00:39:08.00,00:39:08.00,"and now we're separated,we've formed bonds"
615,00:39:09.83,00:39:09.83,"and now they're gone,and we don't know"
616,00:39:12.88,00:39:12.88,what's coming next.It's been really tough.
617,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,>> PROBST: James.Happy with this tribe?
618,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,>> I am.This is a damn fine tribe.

620,00:39:23.96,00:39:23.96,"got a lot of energy,lot of testosterone."
621,00:39:27.33,00:39:27.33,We gonna win some matches.We just didn't do it today.

623,00:39:34.88,00:39:34.88,"of today's challenge,because it was about"
624,00:39:37.50,00:39:37.50,making a choice.And it seems as though
625,00:39:40.25,00:39:40.25,"you guys havea very strong tribe,"
626,00:39:42.92,00:39:42.92,but it was brainsthat beat you today.
627,00:39:45.04,00:39:45.04,Would you agree?>> Yeah.
628,00:39:46.75,00:39:46.75,"We've got the strength,we all have the endurance."
629,00:39:49.25,00:39:49.25,There was justa couple key times
630,00:39:51.21,00:39:51.21,"that we just messed up,and, you know,"
631,00:39:53.04,00:39:53.04,we lost time tryingto get everything
632,00:39:54.88,00:39:54.88,"we possibly couldand get running with it,"
633,00:39:57.62,00:39:57.62,"and... it wasn't gonna happen.>> PROBST: So, James,"
634,00:40:00.67,00:40:00.67,let me be clear.You didn't even bring fire.
635,00:40:03.46,00:40:03.46,"Oh, hell, no.We should've."
636,00:40:05.46,00:40:05.46,You did not take fire?>> Dumb-ass.
637,00:40:08.12,00:40:08.12,">> Well, we tried to get it,but it was last,"
638,00:40:10.33,00:40:10.33,and then when we realized thatwe just lost a tremendous
639,00:40:13.46,00:40:13.46,"amount of time,we just said, okay,"
640,00:40:15.12,00:40:15.12,"just take the other stuff.>> PROBST: Ashlee, is there a"

642,00:40:20.96,00:40:20.96,"the only thingthat's holding this group back,"
643,00:40:24.04,00:40:24.04,is that we have yet to cometogether as a group
644,00:40:28.17,00:40:28.17,and decide who is gonna leadour group right now.
645,00:40:31.25,00:40:31.25,">> PROBST: Jolanda, canthis group lead itself..."
646,00:40:33.25,00:40:33.25,"as a group?>> Uh, no."
647,00:40:35.83,00:40:35.83,We need somebodyto make a unilateral decision.
648,00:40:38.88,00:40:38.88,"I mean, I would like,if I could,"
649,00:40:40.83,00:40:40.83,to help lead the team.But I also know that I have
650,00:40:43.71,00:40:43.71,"a very strong personality.So, that's been"
651,00:40:45.33,00:40:45.33,"my biggest dilemma,because I don't want"
652,00:40:47.88,00:40:47.88,"for people to say,""Oh, you know,"
653,00:40:49.29,00:40:49.29,"""her personality'stoo strong, she's bossy,"

658,00:41:02.17,00:41:02.17,weighing on your mind?Or have you overcome that?
659,00:41:05.58,00:41:05.58,">> It weighs very heavy on mymind. I mean, it's hard"
660,00:41:09.17,00:41:09.17,being picked last.But I think that I tried
661,00:41:12.04,00:41:12.04,"really, really hardat the challenge today,"
662,00:41:13.88,00:41:13.88,"but I thinkdefinitely, my head was gonna be"
663,00:41:16.50,00:41:16.50,"on the chopping block.You know, either there's"
664,00:41:18.58,00:41:18.58,some things going onwhere somebody has
665,00:41:21.00,00:41:21.00,"somebody else in mind,or it's just..."
666,00:41:23.12,00:41:23.12,"it's gonna overwhelmingly be me,so..."
