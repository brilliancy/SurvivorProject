434,00:17:11.71,00:17:11.71,HE HAS NO ALLEGIANCE TO US.
435,00:17:13.29,00:17:13.29,HE'S DONE WITH THIS THREE.

458,00:18:00.92,00:18:00.92,HE MADE A MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION TO LOSE IT.

460,00:18:04.54,00:18:04.54,AND HE REALLY DID A BAD THING TO JANE.
461,00:18:07.12,00:18:07.12,HE REALLY LET HER DOWN.
462,00:18:08.58,00:18:08.58,JUST SHOWS YOU WHAT A... HE IS.

464,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,AND THEN HE JUST SPITS IN HER FACE TODAY.
465,00:18:14.88,00:18:14.88,IT WAS DISGUSTING.
466,00:18:16.12,00:18:16.12,>> HE TOLD YOU STRAIGHT UP HE WAS TAKING YOU?
467,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,>> YEAH.

478,00:18:38.08,00:18:38.08,AND THAT WORRIES ME.
479,00:18:50.88,00:18:50.88,">> WHAT'S THIS, WATERMELON?"

719,00:29:13.71,00:29:13.71,"HE'S ALL THINKING ABOUT IT,"
720,00:29:16.50,00:29:16.50,AND YOU CAN TELL

722,00:29:19.12,00:29:19.12,"AND IT'S LIKE, DUDE,"

724,00:29:22.42,00:29:22.42,THIS COULD GO DOWN AS HIS WORST DECISION.

734,00:29:43.29,00:29:43.29,SENDING DAN HOME TONIGHT FOR YOU AND I.
735,00:29:44.96,00:29:44.96,YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS.
736,00:29:48.29,00:29:48.29,>> I THINK WE'RE LEAVING OURSELVES OPEN
737,00:29:51.08,00:29:51.08,TO SOMEONE SNEAKING IN WHO SHOULDN'T.
738,00:29:57.12,00:29:57.12,>> WHAT ARE THEY...

745,00:30:18.83,00:30:18.83,THEN NONE OF US MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS.
746,00:30:22.92,00:30:22.92,THIS GIVES US THE BEST CHANCE
747,00:30:25.00,00:30:25.00,TO MAKE IT TO THE FINAL THREE.
748,00:30:26.21,00:30:26.21,>> UH-HUH.

755,00:30:38.96,00:30:38.96,SO THEY'RE GOING BACK ON IT.

769,00:31:04.17,00:31:04.17,>> THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS.
770,00:31:16.33,00:31:16.33,>> SO IS IT ME?
771,00:31:21.21,00:31:21.21,>> IS THAT WHAT WE DECIDED?
772,00:31:24.54,00:31:24.54,"BECAUSE Y'ALL KNOW I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, BUT..."
773,00:31:30.46,00:31:30.46,IS THAT WHAT Y'ALL ARE DEAD SET ON?
774,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,">> THIS IS NOT EASY, YOU GUYS."

777,00:31:46.50,00:31:46.50,I GUESS THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION
778,00:31:50.21,00:31:50.21,OF VOTING YOU OUT.
779,00:31:53.79,00:31:53.79,">> THE TRUTH IS,"

787,00:32:17.29,00:32:17.29,THAT WAS THE GAME PLAN THE WHOLE TIME.
788,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,SO THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY FLIPPERS.
789,00:32:22.00,00:32:22.00,THEY'RE LIARS.
790,00:32:23.21,00:32:23.21,THEY'RE CHEATS.
791,00:32:24.12,00:32:24.12,THEY'RE BACKSTABBERS.
792,00:32:27.29,00:32:27.29,I'M MOST DISAPPOINTED
793,00:32:29.25,00:32:29.25,"IN MY CAROLINA HOME BOY, CHASE."

799,00:32:47.96,00:32:47.96,NO.
800,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,AND IF HE WANTS TO TRY

805,00:32:56.50,00:32:56.50,BUT SHE RAISED A DAMN LIAR.
806,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,I'VE NOT STABBED ANYBODY
807,00:33:04.71,00:33:04.71,IN THE BACK IN THIS WHOLE GAME.
808,00:33:06.50,00:33:06.50,SO I AM PROUD OF THE WAY
809,00:33:08.12,00:33:08.12,I PLAYED THIS GAME.
810,00:33:09.54,00:33:09.54,(SIGHS)
811,00:33:14.17,00:33:14.17,I GOT A LITTLE BIT OF THINKING TO DO TONIGHT
812,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,PRIOR TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
813,00:33:18.21,00:33:18.21,"BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP,"

823,00:34:41.29,00:34:41.29,IT HAD TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A CRAZY AFTERNOON.
824,00:34:43.79,00:34:43.79,I'M GUESSING.
825,00:34:45.17,00:34:45.17,">> I MEAN, THERE ARE THINGS..."

831,00:34:57.62,00:34:57.62,AND THREW IT OVER OUR FIRE.
832,00:34:59.00,00:34:59.00,>> I SURE DID.
833,00:35:00.00,00:35:00.00,I STARTED THAT FIRE.
834,00:35:01.38,00:35:01.38,AND I WANTED TO BE THE LAST WOMAN STANDING
835,00:35:03.12,00:35:03.12,TO PUT THE FIRE OUT.
836,00:35:04.71,00:35:04.71,>> Jeff: SO THIS WAS SORT OF A PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENT.
837,00:35:08.21,00:35:08.21,">> WELL, CAN I HAVE MY SAY?"
838,00:35:11.58,00:35:11.58,>> Jeff: IT IS YOUR TRIBAL COUNCIL.
839,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,">> WELL, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO LOYALTY IN TONIGHT'S VOTE."
840,00:35:16.54,00:35:16.54,IT'S FULL OF LIARS
841,00:35:18.92,00:35:18.92,AND BACKSTABBERS.
842,00:35:22.58,00:35:22.58,END OF STORY.
843,00:35:23.96,00:35:23.96,>> Jeff: END OF STORY?
844,00:35:25.42,00:35:25.42,"NO, JUST BEGINNING A STORY."
845,00:35:26.67,00:35:26.67,I WANT MORE.
846,00:35:27.96,00:35:27.96,">> OKAY, THEY'RE GOING"
847,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,"TO VOTE ME OUT TONIGHT, OKAY."
848,00:35:30.96,00:35:30.96,"AND I'M GOING TO CALL SOME PEOPLE ON SOME STUFF, OKAY."
849,00:35:33.33,00:35:33.33,"HOLLY, YOU CALL YOURSELF"
850,00:35:35.54,00:35:35.54,A COACH AND A MENTOR.
851,00:35:37.04,00:35:37.04,"YET, YOU STEAL $1,400 WORTH"
852,00:35:39.00,00:35:39.00,OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.
853,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,"WHERE I COME FROM,"
854,00:35:41.62,00:35:41.62,"YOU'D GO TO JAIL, OKAY."
855,00:35:43.12,00:35:43.12,>> Jeff: YOU'RE REFERRING TO?
856,00:35:44.92,00:35:44.92,>> SHOES THAT BELONGED TO DANNY.
857,00:35:47.12,00:35:47.12,OKAY?
858,00:35:48.83,00:35:48.83,>> OKAY.
859,00:35:50.21,00:35:50.21,">> Jeff: SO, JANE, YOU'RE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE..."
860,00:35:52.29,00:35:52.29,">> NO, IT'S NOT THAT I'M FRUSTRATED."
861,00:35:54.04,00:35:54.04,I'M UPSET THAT I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH PEOPLE
862,00:35:57.25,00:35:57.25,"WHO RIGHT NOW ARE THROWING ME UNDER THE BUS,"
863,00:36:00.12,00:36:00.12,AND YET THE FOUR OF US HAD ALWAYS DECIDED
864,00:36:03.25,00:36:03.25,TO GET RID OF THESE TWO
865,00:36:04.62,00:36:04.62,AND US STAY AS A FOURSOME.
866,00:36:06.17,00:36:06.17,THAT WAS THE ALLIANCE.
867,00:36:07.25,00:36:07.25,THAT'S HOW BENRY GOT VOTED OFF.
868,00:36:09.38,00:36:09.38,">> Jeff: CHASE, ALLIANCES ARE ONLY AS GOOD"
869,00:36:13.25,00:36:13.25,AS THEY ARE GOOD.
870,00:36:15.08,00:36:15.08,SO JANE COULD BELIEVE SHE'S IN A FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE
871,00:36:18.29,00:36:18.29,AND NOT ACTUALLY BE IN A FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE.
872,00:36:20.12,00:36:20.12,">> NO, JANE WAS IN A FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE,"
873,00:36:22.08,00:36:22.08,"AND THIS AFTERNOON, WE SET HER ASIDE"
874,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,AND SAID THAT IT'S IN OUR BEST INTEREST
875,00:36:26.92,00:36:26.92,TO HAVE A SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME
876,00:36:28.96,00:36:28.96,TO POSSIBLY SEND HER HOME.
877,00:36:30.46,00:36:30.46,AND WE TOLD HER THAT.
878,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT,"
879,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,LET ME ASK THE ALLIANCE OF THREE
880,00:36:35.75,00:36:35.75,THAT SEEMS TO BE IN CHARGE.
881,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,"IF YOU VOTE OUT JANE TONIGHT, WHO'S NEXT?"
882,00:36:39.29,00:36:39.29,>> I WOULD SAY IT'S...
883,00:36:41.54,00:36:41.54,WHOEVER DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY NEXT.
884,00:36:43.08,00:36:43.08,>> Jeff: SO IT'S FABIO OR DAN.
885,00:36:45.79,00:36:45.79,>> WOULD YOU GUYS AGREE WITH THAT?
886,00:36:47.83,00:36:47.83,">> OH, MY GOD."
887,00:36:52.50,00:36:52.50,>> WOULD YOU GUYS AGREE WITH THAT?
888,00:36:55.29,00:36:55.29,>> Jeff: GAME IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
889,00:36:58.25,00:36:58.25,>> HOLLY?
890,00:36:59.25,00:36:59.25,>> YEAH.
891,00:37:00.33,00:37:00.33,>> YES.
892,00:37:02.04,00:37:02.04,>> Jeff: SO YOU JUST CONFERRED
893,00:37:03.88,00:37:03.88,"IN FRONT OF THE OTHER THREE,"
894,00:37:05.29,00:37:05.29,"WHICH I GOTTA HAND IT TO YOU GUYS,"
895,00:37:07.08,00:37:07.08,"IS A BALLSY, BIG MOVE."
896,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,"SO, FABIO, ARE YOU HEARING"
897,00:37:10.54,00:37:10.54,WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?
898,00:37:11.92,00:37:11.92,">> IT SOUNDS LIKE IF I DON'T WIN AGAIN,"
899,00:37:14.08,00:37:14.08,I COULD BE GOING NEXT.
900,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,">> IT'S WRITING ON THE WALL, FABIO."
901,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,>> Jeff: YOU HAVE THREE PEOPLE
902,00:37:19.88,00:37:19.88,JUST TOLD YOU FLAT OUT
903,00:37:21.67,00:37:21.67,THAT THERE IS A THREE-PERSON ALLIANCE.
904,00:37:24.58,00:37:24.58,"THERE ARE THREE OTHER PEOPLE,"
905,00:37:26.38,00:37:26.38,"DAN, FABIO, AND JANE."
906,00:37:28.29,00:37:28.29,"SO LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION THAT MY MOM WOULD WANT ASKED,"
907,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,WHICH IS WHY DON'T THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ALLIANCE?
908,00:37:34.21,00:37:34.21,TRY TO DO SOMETHING?
909,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,OR FORCE A VOTE?
910,00:37:37.29,00:37:37.29,IT SEEMS CRAZY?
911,00:37:41.29,00:37:41.29,"JANE, WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST"
912,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,TO DO RIGHT NOW?
913,00:37:44.33,00:37:44.33,>> US THREE VOTE HOLLY OUT.
914,00:37:46.71,00:37:46.71,BECAUSE THESE TWO HAVE AN IDOL.
915,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,>> Jeff: OKAY.
916,00:37:51.50,00:37:51.50,"CHASE AND SASH,"
917,00:37:53.08,00:37:53.08,YOU BOTH HAVE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS?
918,00:37:54.38,00:37:54.38,>> NAONKA GAVE IT TO ME.
919,00:37:56.12,00:37:56.12,>> Jeff: AND YOU BROUGHT YOURS.
920,00:37:57.83,00:37:57.83,">> YES, IT'S IN MY BAG."

924,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,"AND SAY I WANT A SHOT TO WIN,"
925,00:38:07.75,00:38:07.75,NOT TAKE FOURTH.
