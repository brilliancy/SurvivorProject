595,00:30:09.23,00:30:09.23,SHE MAKES UP THESE LIES THAT ARE KIND OF BELIEVABLE.
596,00:30:14.00,00:30:14.00,THEY'RE ALWAYS...
597,00:30:14.53,00:30:14.53,>> SHE WASN'T EVEN THE WORST.
598,00:30:16.77,00:30:16.77,I THOUGHT KASS WAS MUCH WORST.
599,00:30:17.97,00:30:17.97,>> I THINK THEY'RE BOTH FEEDING OFF EACH OTHER.
600,00:30:20.17,00:30:20.17,>> HOW DO WE DO THIS?
601,00:30:21.57,00:30:21.57,>> I FEEL LIKE KASS IS KIND OF STIRRING UP THE MOST RIGHT NOW.
602,00:30:24.90,00:30:24.90,>> WITH THIS VOTE I'D RATHER HAVE CIERA GO.
603,00:30:27.50,00:30:27.50,SHE IS SO DANGEROUS.
604,00:30:29.27,00:30:29.27,FOR ME SHE'S PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE AND HAS TO GO.
605,00:30:32.57,00:30:32.57,>> I'M LEANING TOWARD KASS.
606,00:30:34.63,00:30:34.63,>> THAT'S A AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD VOTE.
607,00:30:37.37,00:30:37.37,">> AT THIS POINT IF THE MAJORITY WANTS KASS, SOMETIMES IT'S BEST"
608,00:30:41.23,00:30:41.23,"JUST TO GO WITH THE MAJORITY, BECAUSE KASS IS ALMOST A LITTLE"
609,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,"RUTHLESS AND A LITTLE BIT HAPHAZARD, AND THAT SCARES ME."
610,00:30:51.00,00:30:51.00,>> AS FAR AS WHO YOU WANT TO DO?
611,00:30:55.03,00:30:55.03,IT'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE WHO IS CAUSING PROBLEMS.
612,00:30:59.97,00:30:59.97,WHO DO YOU THINK?
613,00:31:00.53,00:31:00.53,>> I'M THINKING KASS.
614,00:31:02.57,00:31:02.57,>> KASS.
615,00:31:06.37,00:31:06.37,>> THAT'S THE MOVE.
616,00:31:07.53,00:31:07.53,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
617,00:31:09.70,00:31:09.70,THAT'S FINE AND DANDY WITH ME.
618,00:31:10.87,00:31:10.87,">> I'VE BEEN CONFLICTED ABOUT WHICH WAY TO GO, BUT I FEEL THE"
619,00:31:15.93,00:31:15.93,"NUMBERS GOING WHERE THEY'RE GOING, AND NOT STOPPING TO WAIT"
620,00:31:19.93,00:31:19.93,FOR ME.
621,00:31:20.83,00:31:20.83,KASS WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE LAST VOTE THAT WAS WILLING TO
622,00:31:23.40,00:31:23.40,"PLAY WITH ME, AND EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO SAVE HER, I'M NOT SURE I"
623,00:31:27.60,00:31:27.60,CAN.
624,00:31:30.77,00:31:30.77,>> I DON'T THINK SHE DOES.
625,00:31:32.23,00:31:32.23,>> IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY IS VOTING KASS.
626,00:31:35.57,00:31:35.57,"BUT KASS COULD HAVE AN IDOL, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
627,00:31:39.43,00:31:39.43,IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SPLIT VOTES.
628,00:31:41.30,00:31:41.30,>> I KNOW I'M VOTING KASS.
629,00:31:43.90,00:31:43.90,>> KASS.
630,00:31:44.53,00:31:44.53,>> KASS.
631,00:31:44.97,00:31:44.97,>> WE HAVE THE NUMBERS TO VOTE HER OUT.
632,00:31:47.27,00:31:47.27,">> SAY SHE HAS AN IDOL, HOW DO YOU STOP THAT?"
633,00:31:52.10,00:31:52.10,>> IT'S 5-4 SPLIT.
634,00:31:54.37,00:31:54.37,">> FIVE KASS, FOUR CIERA."
635,00:31:57.97,00:31:57.97,">> SO FIVE KASS, FOUR CIERA."
636,00:31:59.60,00:31:59.60,">> I THINK THAT'S FOOLPROOF, RIGHT?"
637,00:32:02.67,00:32:02.67,>> THAT'S THE IDEAL WAY.
638,00:32:04.43,00:32:04.43,">> I HATE TO SAY, THIS YOU KNOW, BUT IF THEY WANT KASS DOWN, I'M"
639,00:32:09.33,00:32:09.33,DOWN FOR IT.
640,00:32:10.33,00:32:10.33,SHE STIRS UP A LOT OF BICKERING.
641,00:32:12.50,00:32:12.50,AT THIS POINT I'D JUST AL-AZAWI SOON LET HER GO.
642,00:32:16.97,00:32:16.97,>> THE BREE DOWN IS HAPPENING.
643,00:32:18.57,00:32:18.57,>> IT'S SUCH AN UGLY SIGHT JUST TO WATCH.
644,00:32:22.13,00:32:22.13,"WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT THING THAT EATS PEOPLE, VULTURES?"
645,00:32:25.40,00:32:25.40,IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED?
646,00:32:26.80,00:32:26.80,>> THEY'RE JUST... WHATEVER.
647,00:32:28.40,00:32:28.40,>> I SHOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THIS.
648,00:32:30.57,00:32:30.57,IT STARTED WITH TASHA.
649,00:32:32.50,00:32:32.50,NOW I THINK KEITH'S GOING WITH THE MAJORITY.
650,00:32:34.83,00:32:34.83,WHY WOULD THEY BE SITTING THERE TALKING?
651,00:32:37.20,00:32:37.20,>> THEY'LL SPLIT THE VOTE.
652,00:32:40.10,00:32:40.10,THEY'LL SPLIT FIVE-FOUR.
653,00:32:42.27,00:32:42.27,>> THEY HAVE THE MAJORITY.
654,00:32:43.67,00:32:43.67,"SO THEY MIGHT SPLIT THE VOTE, AND IF I CAN GET FIVE PEOPLE TO"
655,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,"AGREE TO VOTE TASH, TASHA'S GONE."
656,00:32:51.00,00:32:51.00,>> THEY'RE SPLITTING.
657,00:32:53.13,00:32:53.13,>> ALL WE NEED IS FIVE.
658,00:32:55.83,00:32:55.83,THEY'RE SPLITTING VOTES.
659,00:32:56.37,00:32:56.37,">> IF WE ALL VOTE TASHA, THEY'RE ALL STUCK IN IT."
660,00:33:02.33,00:33:02.33,"IF WE CAN GET TO SPENCER, WE'RE GOOD WITH HIM, WE'LL SEE WHAT'S"
661,00:33:08.30,00:33:08.30,UP?

663,00:33:12.13,00:33:12.13,COULD BE SPLITTING THE VOTE.
664,00:33:13.13,00:33:13.13,"AFTER THE HUGE BLOWOUT FIGHT TODAY, THERE IS A DEFINITE"
665,00:33:16.13,00:33:16.13,CHANCE THAT IT COULD BE ME GOING HOME TONIGHT.
666,00:33:19.33,00:33:19.33,>>IDEALLY I WOULD LOVE IF KASS COULD GET SPENCER SO WE COULD
667,00:33:24.40,00:33:24.40,MAKE A MOVE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
668,00:33:26.43,00:33:26.43,>> THEY'RE SPLITTING VOTES.
669,00:33:27.87,00:33:27.87,"IF WE GET FIVE, WE CAN GET OUT."
670,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,>> YEAH.
671,00:33:31.40,00:33:31.40,>> ABI AND CIERA AND WENTWORTH SAID SHE WOULD DO IT.
672,00:33:36.50,00:33:36.50,>> WE ALL VOTING TASHA?
673,00:33:38.83,00:33:38.83,>> WE ARE.
674,00:33:39.53,00:33:39.53,>> THIS IS A CHANCE TO MAKE A MOVE THAT FURTHERS BOTH OF US.
675,00:33:42.43,00:33:42.43,>> I KNOW.
676,00:33:43.43,00:33:43.43,OKAY.
677,00:33:43.70,00:33:43.70,>> YOU HAD MY BACK.
678,00:33:45.37,00:33:45.37,>> LET'S DO IT.
679,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,>> OKAY.
680,00:33:46.67,00:33:46.67,>> THERE WILL BE A VOTE TONIGHT BETWEEN KASS AND CIERA AND
681,00:33:51.27,00:33:51.27,TASHA.
682,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,>> IT'S GETTING UGLY FOR NO REASON.
683,00:33:55.37,00:33:55.37,>> IT WILL BE BETTER AFTER TONIGHT.
684,00:33:57.03,00:33:57.03,>> MY DECISION TONIGHT WILL DETERMINE WHO GOES HOME.
685,00:33:59.53,00:33:59.53,"I ALWAYS THOUGHT TASHA WAS A FRIEND, BUT KASS AND CIERA"
686,00:34:03.30,00:34:03.30,ACTUALLY HAD MY BACK AND SAVED ME.
687,00:34:06.47,00:34:06.47,MY LUCK HAS TRULY TURNED AROUND.
688,00:34:08.40,00:34:08.40,I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THIS POSITION BEFORE TO INFLUENCE THE
689,00:34:12.30,00:34:12.30,GAME.

691,00:34:36.70,00:34:36.70,"AND GRAB ONE, DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE."
692,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57,THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE FIRE
693,00:34:43.57,00:34:43.57,REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
694,00:34:44.90,00:34:44.90,"WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE YOU."
695,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,SO BIGGEST TRIBAL COUNCIL WE'VE EVER HAD.
696,00:34:53.93,00:34:53.93,"CIERA, TODAY AT THE CHALLENGE, I JUST BRIEFLY ASKED HOW THINGS"
697,00:34:56.83,00:34:56.83,"WERE GOING, AND THE RESPONSE I GOT LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S"
698,00:35:02.53,00:35:02.53,PRETTY CHAOTIC.
699,00:35:02.83,00:35:02.83,>> CHAOTIC IS PUTTING IT MILDLY.
700,00:35:05.17,00:35:05.17,I KNEW COMING INTO THIS SECOND-CHANCE SEASON IT WAS
701,00:35:09.57,00:35:09.57,"GOING TO BE QUICK AND FAST, BUT, MAN, IT'S BEYOND WORDS HOW CRAZY"
702,00:35:12.90,00:35:12.90,IT'S BEEN.
703,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,">> Jeff: KASS, IS THERE A POINT EVEN FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU"
704,00:35:17.47,00:35:17.47,"WHO THRIVES IN TOTAL CHAOS WHERE YOU THINK, THIS IS TOO MUCH EVEN"
705,00:35:20.63,00:35:20.63,FOR ME?
706,00:35:21.07,00:35:21.07,">> WELL, I'M NOT PLAYING THE CHAOS GAME THIS TIME."
707,00:35:23.77,00:35:23.77,I FIND IT FUNNY THAT SOME PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO BE CALM ARE IN THE
708,00:35:28.37,00:35:28.37,CENTER OF CHAOS.
709,00:35:30.43,00:35:30.43,>> Jeff: LIKE WHO?
710,00:35:31.13,00:35:31.13,>> LIKE TASHA?
711,00:35:33.07,00:35:33.07,>> DON'T EVEN PLAY.
712,00:35:34.80,00:35:34.80,DON'T EVEN PLAY.
713,00:35:35.27,00:35:35.27,DO NOT EVEN PLAY WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
714,00:35:37.67,00:35:37.67,CHAOS IS WHAT SHE OPERATES IN.
715,00:35:39.63,00:35:39.63,I DON'T OPERATE IN THAT.
716,00:35:40.77,00:35:40.77,"SO IF THERE IS CHAOS, THAT'S HER M.O., THAT'S NOT MINE."
717,00:35:45.00,00:35:45.00,BUT I'M GOING TO CALL YOU ON YOUR STUFF.
718,00:35:46.53,00:35:46.53,>> SHE TOLD ME THE BAYON ALLIANCE WAS OVER.
719,00:35:48.83,00:35:48.83,">> NO, I DID NOT."
720,00:35:51.20,00:35:51.20,>> BUT KASS IN SOME REGARD IS NOT CREATING LIES.
721,00:35:54.97,00:35:54.97,SOME THINGS SHE'S SAYING ARE TRUE.
722,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,">> DON'T SPIN IT IN A WAY THAT'S ADVANTAGEOUS FOR YOU AND SAID,"
723,00:36:02.77,00:36:02.77,TASHA SAID BYE-BYE BUYON.
724,00:36:04.43,00:36:04.43,I DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT.
725,00:36:05.83,00:36:05.83,>> Jeff: ARE YOU TALKING TO KASS OR CIERA?
726,00:36:07.83,00:36:07.83,>> I'M TALKING TO BOTH.
727,00:36:09.33,00:36:09.33,>> Jeff: CIERA ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT GUILT BY
728,00:36:12.13,00:36:12.13,ASSOCIATION?
729,00:36:12.43,00:36:12.43,>> YES.
730,00:36:12.73,00:36:12.73,YOU NEVER WANT TO BE PART OF NIKKEIORS IN THIS GAME OR HAVE
731,00:36:16.80,00:36:16.80,ANYBODY LOOKING TO YOU.
732,00:36:18.07,00:36:18.07,"BUT OBVIOUSLY MY NAME WAS BROUGHT UP, SO THAT'S THE"
733,00:36:20.67,00:36:20.67,REALITY OF THE GAME.

736,00:36:30.13,00:36:30.13,"MENTIONED, TASH HAS BEEN IN AN ARGUMENT."
737,00:36:32.70,00:36:32.70,IT COULD BE ANYBODY.
738,00:36:33.50,00:36:33.50,">> IT COULD BE ANYBODY, BUT IT'S THE FIRST VOTE AFTER THE MERGE,"
739,00:36:37.77,00:36:37.77,AND EVERYONE IS AFRAID TO JUMP ON ONE SIDE OF THE FENCE OR THE
740,00:36:40.47,00:36:40.47,"OTHER, SO THE EASIEST VOTE ARE THESE THREE RIGHT HERE."
741,00:36:46.23,00:36:46.23,>> Jeff: CIERA HOW DOES IT FEEL HO-TO-HAVE JOE SAY IT SEEMS
742,00:36:51.20,00:36:51.20,"EASY, CIERA, KASS OR TASHA."
743,00:36:53.13,00:36:53.13,>> IT SHOULD NOT BE EASY.
744,00:36:54.87,00:36:54.87,"IT SHOULD BE GOING FOR THE JUGULAR, LIKE IF THIS IS SUCH AN"
745,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,"EASY VOTE, YOU'RE NOT PLAYING THE RIGHT VOTE."
746,00:37:00.20,00:37:00.20,AND I DON'T LAKE PLAYING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED THE PLAY.
747,00:37:03.43,00:37:03.43,I WANT THE WIN.
748,00:37:04.33,00:37:04.33,IT'S NOT FUN TO PLAY WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO WIN?
749,00:37:06.73,00:37:06.73,>> Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
750,00:37:08.10,00:37:08.10,EVERYBODY WANTS TO WIN.
751,00:37:08.87,00:37:08.87,>> ONLY ONE PERSON WILL WIN THIS GAME.
752,00:37:11.13,00:37:11.13,SO EVERYBODY SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR THEMSELVES.
753,00:37:13.57,00:37:13.57,I HAVE PLAYED IN A SITUATION WHERE I PLAYED FOR SIX.
754,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,DON'T.

775,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,>> Jeff: SPENCER.
776,00:38:02.63,00:38:02.63,MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED AN ALLIANCE AT ALL.
777,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,YOU JUST NEED VOTING BLOCS FOR EACH TRIBAL.
