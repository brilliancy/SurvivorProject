46,00:03:23.50,00:03:23.50,"and if they were, then you'regoing to be marked."
47,00:03:26.17,00:03:26.17,">> I went looking for it, but...if I get the next clue, I'll"
48,00:03:30.00,00:03:30.00,"find it, 'cause I'll go lookingfor it again."
49,00:03:38.83,00:03:38.83,>> Russell's going to find outsoon enough that he's out of
50,00:03:41.38,00:03:41.38,his league.I just did everything I could

52,00:03:47.46,00:03:47.46,like a crazy man....but a lot of people are
53,00:03:53.83,00:03:53.83,mad that you went looking forthat idol.
54,00:03:55.75,00:03:55.75,They want your ass off.He's not playing with the
55,00:03:57.92,00:03:57.92,amateurs anymore.He's playing with the big boys
