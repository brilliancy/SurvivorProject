1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.73,00:00:01.73,(Jeff Probst) Previously on Survivor:
3,00:00:04.13,00:00:04.13,"- Down, down, down!"
4,00:00:06.03,00:00:06.03,- (Probst) 16 strangers were abandoned in the heart
5,00:00:08.03,00:00:08.03,of wild Africa.
6,00:00:09.07,00:00:09.07,- Have a nice day.
7,00:00:10.37,00:00:10.37,- We could take one full and if
8,00:00:11.73,00:00:11.73,it's too heavy we can dump it on the way.
9,00:00:12.70,00:00:12.70,- Oh...
10,00:00:14.47,00:00:14.47,- (Probst) Desperation set in when both tribes discovered
11,00:00:17.07,00:00:17.07,their water sources weren't what they expected.
12,00:00:18.77,00:00:18.77,- It's sick.
13,00:00:20.03,00:00:20.03,The water is disgusting.
14,00:00:20.90,00:00:20.90,I'm terrified.
15,00:00:21.93,00:00:21.93,- We'll have to boil it.
16,00:00:24.03,00:00:24.03,You end up with dysentery which basically has you puking and
17,00:00:27.40,00:00:27.40,crapping your guts out.
18,00:00:28.47,00:00:28.47,"- Go, baby!"
19,00:00:29.97,00:00:29.97,"- (Probst) The first challenge took its toll,"
20,00:00:31.97,00:00:31.97,especially on Diane from Boran.
21,00:00:34.27,00:00:34.27,Samburu claimed victory and immunity.
22,00:00:36.30,00:00:36.30,"Back at the Boran camp, Clarence was in hot water for sharing a"
23,00:00:39.73,00:00:39.73,can of beans with Diane while the others were away.
24,00:00:42.57,00:00:42.57,"- Tommy, Tommy..."
25,00:00:43.63,00:00:43.63,I had to open it for her.
26,00:00:45.10,00:00:45.10,- You ain't no doctor.
27,00:00:46.43,00:00:46.43,"- (Probst) At the first Tribal Council,"
28,00:00:47.93,00:00:47.93,"Clarence paid for his actions by receiving votes,"
29,00:00:50.70,00:00:50.70,but Diane was the first one voted out of the tribe.
30,00:00:53.63,00:00:53.63,15 are left.
31,00:00:55.40,00:00:55.40,Who will be voted out tonight?
32,00:00:57.73,00:00:57.73,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
33,00:02:22.50,00:02:22.50,- Going to Tribal Council
34,00:02:23.93,00:02:23.93,is like going to hell for 45 minutes.
35,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,"It's hot, it's uncomfortable,"
36,00:02:29.77,00:02:29.77,and nothing good is going to happen while you're there.
37,00:02:34.43,00:02:34.43,- Did you put your torch there?
38,00:02:36.93,00:02:36.93,"- Yeah, I'm going to go put it away."
39,00:02:38.47,00:02:38.47,"- Well, it was tough."
40,00:02:39.83,00:02:39.83,It was tough on all of us.
41,00:02:44.77,00:02:44.77,- Having your name read by Jeff is horrible.
42,00:02:47.17,00:02:47.17,"There was a sinking feeling,"
43,00:02:48.77,00:02:48.77,like I can't believe this is happening.
44,00:02:52.07,00:02:52.07,- Despite the fact that all of us had agreed that we are all
45,00:02:54.73,00:02:54.73,"going to vote unanimously for Diane, we thought it was a"
46,00:02:56.93,00:02:56.93,really good opportunity for one of us to vote for Clarence just
47,00:03:01.03,00:03:01.03,to teach him a lesson and just so he knows that he's on shaky
48,00:03:04.97,00:03:04.97,ground and that he needs to shape up.
49,00:03:10.80,00:03:10.80,- I'm just trying to explain to you that I wouldn't stop to
50,00:03:13.57,00:03:13.57,"Diane, and she turned around and bit me."
51,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,"All she did was tell me, you know,"
52,00:03:17.30,00:03:17.30,"""You're my only friend here."""
53,00:03:18.33,00:03:18.33,- So what do you think?
54,00:03:19.43,00:03:19.43,Did she try to screw you?
55,00:03:20.60,00:03:20.60,- I think she knew.
56,00:03:21.60,00:03:21.60,"She knew that she made bad waves,"
57,00:03:22.83,00:03:22.83,"and she looking for somebody to scapegoat,"
58,00:03:25.13,00:03:25.13,and she almost had me.
59,00:03:26.27,00:03:26.27,"- Well, I don't know, Clarence."
60,00:03:28.63,00:03:28.63,It was not a very good time.
61,00:03:30.73,00:03:30.73,You shouldn't have done that in the first place.
62,00:03:34.23,00:03:34.23,"- You know, that's my own fault, for being too nice."
63,00:03:37.63,00:03:37.63,- He's very nervous.
64,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,He was shaking.
65,00:03:40.67,00:03:40.67,"He came up to me, and, like, was looking for my approval on how I"
66,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,"felt about him and what he had done, and it felt like he needed"
67,00:03:49.07,00:03:49.07,me to tell him that he was going to be okay.
68,00:03:51.63,00:03:51.63,"- But I'm saying, I didn't do (...) wrong."
69,00:03:53.93,00:03:53.93,- You opened a can of beans.
70,00:03:55.27,00:03:55.27,"- Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right."
71,00:03:57.07,00:03:57.07,- You didn't do nothing wrong?
72,00:03:58.30,00:03:58.30,"- You're right, you're right."
73,00:03:59.73,00:03:59.73,"- Come on, you made a bad call."
74,00:04:01.07,00:04:01.07,"- All right, that's fair."
75,00:04:02.30,00:04:02.30,- You're going to have a fair chance.
76,00:04:03.93,00:04:03.93,You don't have to worry about that.
77,00:04:05.17,00:04:05.17,- I'm not worried about the game.
78,00:04:06.47,00:04:06.47,- You are worried about the game.
79,00:04:07.60,00:04:07.60,You are worried about the game.
80,00:04:08.67,00:04:08.67,Don't sit here and tell me
81,00:04:10.23,00:04:10.23,you're not worried about the game.
82,00:04:11.47,00:04:11.47,"- All right, I'm worried about the game, but..."
83,00:04:12.57,00:04:12.57,- You are worried about the game.
84,00:04:14.63,00:04:14.63,"- We were presented with an unfortunate situation, but we"
85,00:04:18.13,00:04:18.13,"turned around, and it ended up working really in our favor,"
86,00:04:21.23,00:04:21.23,because now everybody knows exactly what Clarence is about.
87,00:04:24.10,00:04:24.10,He can't hide anymore.
88,00:04:41.73,00:04:41.73,"- Man, everything aches."
89,00:04:44.10,00:04:44.10,- Everything aches.
90,00:04:45.77,00:04:45.77,- Sleeping on the ground is getting really tough.
91,00:04:48.67,00:04:48.67,It's a lot colder than I thought it was going to be at night.
92,00:04:51.47,00:04:51.47,I've shivered both nights straight through
93,00:04:53.00,00:04:53.00,the whole entire night.
94,00:04:54.63,00:04:54.63,- I'll never complain again about a lumpy bed in a motel.
95,00:04:58.23,00:04:58.23,- The comfort level sleeping is definitely something that we
96,00:05:01.80,00:05:01.80,could use a little bit more of.
97,00:05:03.60,00:05:03.60,I don't think one person has gotten a good night's sleep
98,00:05:06.40,00:05:06.40,"since we've been here, so that's tough."
99,00:05:13.40,00:05:13.40,- It's amazing how hot it is during the day.
100,00:05:16.67,00:05:16.67,So we worked on a shelter because we knew we really needed
101,00:05:18.77,00:05:18.77,to get under the shade.
102,00:05:20.40,00:05:20.40,"We don't really have any shade in there, and the sun is so hot,"
103,00:05:23.30,00:05:23.30,so we started to build a roof across the top.
104,00:05:24.73,00:05:24.73,- Lindsey.
105,00:05:24.73,00:05:24.73,- Yeah?
106,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,We're going to tear the door apart and save all the materials
107,00:05:28.90,00:05:28.90,over to the side outside the hut.
108,00:05:30.30,00:05:30.30,- Okay.
109,00:05:31.67,00:05:31.67,"Yes, Captain."
110,00:05:33.27,00:05:33.27,"- Frank is a really interesting character, but"
111,00:05:35.97,00:05:35.97,"really for the military, you know, he barks orders and he"
112,00:05:39.40,00:05:39.40,"just wants things to be done, kind of right now, his way."
113,00:05:42.57,00:05:42.57,"- We'll go right here in to this corner, and we'll tie into"
114,00:05:45.27,00:05:45.27,that corner and over to that large one there.
115,00:05:47.40,00:05:47.40,"- Water, excuse me."
116,00:05:49.27,00:05:49.27,I can't speak.
117,00:05:50.73,00:05:50.73,- I've been working my buns off.
118,00:05:52.97,00:05:52.97,"Frank's been working his buns off, and we're always"
119,00:05:55.73,00:05:55.73,thinking the next step ahead
120,00:05:57.30,00:05:57.30,because other people don't do that.
121,00:05:59.10,00:05:59.10,- This is where you're going to come in to the shade.
122,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,He's going to be pushing that in.
123,00:06:02.47,00:06:02.47,"- What do you think, Lindsay, Kim... input?"
124,00:06:04.83,00:06:04.83,- I say you all give me a job and I'll get up on it.
125,00:06:08.57,00:06:08.57,- The youth were out here like on a vacation.
126,00:06:11.77,00:06:11.77,"They just straggle here or there, you know, whether it's"
127,00:06:14.97,00:06:14.97,"their way of making us do all the work, Carl and myself,"
128,00:06:18.57,00:06:18.57,we have to just jump in there and do something.
129,00:06:21.57,00:06:21.57,"You know, Linda and Teresa-- usually don't have to ask them."
130,00:06:24.93,00:06:24.93,"They're up, ""What can we do?"""
131,00:06:27.67,00:06:27.67,- We're almost like two completely different teams.
132,00:06:30.67,00:06:30.67,For some reason our camp is split
133,00:06:33.10,00:06:33.10,right down the middle by age.
134,00:06:35.13,00:06:35.13,"- That's good, that works."
135,00:06:37.60,00:06:37.60,- This is nice.
136,00:06:39.67,00:06:39.67,"- I would like to see these differences overcome, but if it"
137,00:06:42.07,00:06:42.07,happens the way I have this gut feeling it's going to happen and
138,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,"someone's got to be voted out, I have no problem with it."
139,00:06:47.40,00:06:47.40,There's one or two individuals I could get rid of right now that
140,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,are probably more in the way than are any good.
141,00:06:57.50,00:06:57.50,"- Oh, this is the mail route."
142,00:06:59.13,00:06:59.13,This is the first time I've been here.
143,00:07:00.53,00:07:00.53,- This is it.
144,00:07:04.10,00:07:04.10,There's a necklace in here with a message.
145,00:07:07.33,00:07:07.33,"""Go straight to the top for prizes sublime."
146,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,"""The way to succeed is one step at a time."
147,00:07:15.10,00:07:15.10,"""You can't do it alone, you must work as one,"
148,00:07:18.27,00:07:18.27,"or disappointment awaits when the challenge is done."""
149,00:07:22.80,00:07:22.80,- What else is in here? That's it?
150,00:07:25.80,00:07:25.80,"- ""You can't do it alone."
151,00:07:27.07,00:07:27.07,"""You must work as one,"
152,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,"or disappointment awaits when the challenge is done."""
153,00:07:30.97,00:07:30.97,- Maybe it's rock climbing.
154,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,"- Ooh, that would be cool."
155,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,- Ooh.
156,00:07:33.97,00:07:33.97,- We should probably think about what we want because
157,00:07:36.13,00:07:36.13,looks like one of those things where they might give us
158,00:07:38.63,00:07:38.63,a choice of what we want more than anything else.
159,00:07:40.67,00:07:40.67,"- I still say blankets, I think, on the basic needs level."
160,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,- Bedding?
161,00:07:44.07,00:07:44.07,"- Bedding, yeah, it has been"
162,00:07:45.10,00:07:45.10,hard to get comfortable sleeping.
163,00:07:46.83,00:07:46.83,"- Well, I've felt better, but I guess I've felt worse."
164,00:07:49.90,00:07:49.90,We'll open this can of whoop-ass and see what happens.
165,00:07:52.60,00:07:52.60,- There you go.
166,00:07:53.73,00:07:53.73,- There we go.
167,00:08:02.30,00:08:02.30,"- (Probst) Hey, guys."
168,00:08:04.10,00:08:04.10,Today's challenge is for reward.
169,00:08:06.73,00:08:06.73,Here's how it works.
170,00:08:08.07,00:08:08.07,Each tribe has five logs.
171,00:08:09.60,00:08:09.60,"Your goal: Get your five logs to your tower, building a"
172,00:08:13.60,00:08:13.60,"staircase, and get somebody to the top."
173,00:08:16.63,00:08:16.63,Along the way are a series of obstacles on your path.
174,00:08:19.50,00:08:19.50,The first tribe to get all five logs to the tower and get one
175,00:08:23.13,00:08:23.13,member to the top wins a reward.
176,00:08:25.13,00:08:25.13,The reward is a few things...
177,00:08:26.77,00:08:26.77,"We got blankets, food--"
178,00:08:30.07,00:08:30.07,everything else is stuff
179,00:08:31.13,00:08:31.13,you guys left behind back on day one.
180,00:08:32.97,00:08:32.97,You've got to stay together as a tribe.
181,00:08:35.33,00:08:35.33,You've got to stay on your own path.
182,00:08:37.43,00:08:37.43,"Samburu, because you guys have one extra member,"
183,00:08:39.27,00:08:39.27,somebody has to sit this one out.
184,00:08:41.00,00:08:41.00,"And remember, you can't sit the same person out"
185,00:08:43.73,00:08:43.73,in back-to-back challenges.
186,00:08:45.10,00:08:45.10,Wait for my start.
187,00:08:47.17,00:08:47.17,- This is upper body strength.
188,00:08:50.23,00:08:50.23,"- It's me, it's me."
189,00:08:51.80,00:08:51.80,"- (Probst) Okay, here we go."
190,00:08:53.00,00:08:53.00,"Survivors, ready!"
191,00:08:54.07,00:08:54.07,Go!
192,00:08:55.90,00:08:55.90,"- Go, go, go."
193,00:08:58.30,00:08:58.30,- Woo!
194,00:09:00.90,00:09:00.90,"- Here we go, up over this."
195,00:09:02.73,00:09:02.73,"- Foot up, foot up."
196,00:09:03.90,00:09:03.90,Watch stage right.
197,00:09:04.93,00:09:04.93,"Slide, put the log on."
198,00:09:06.73,00:09:06.73,Push it over.
199,00:09:06.73,00:09:06.73,- Slide.
200,00:09:07.63,00:09:07.63,"- Push, push."
201,00:09:08.73,00:09:08.73,- Here we go.
202,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00,"- Lay it down, lay it down."
203,00:09:11.30,00:09:11.30,- Push it.
204,00:09:12.40,00:09:12.40,"Push it, lift."
205,00:09:13.43,00:09:13.43,"Lift, lift, lift."
206,00:09:14.50,00:09:14.50,"Step, step."
207,00:09:15.33,00:09:15.33,- Stop.
208,00:09:16.63,00:09:16.63,"Step up, step up."
209,00:09:18.30,00:09:18.30,"- Go straight, go straight."
210,00:09:21.43,00:09:21.43,"- Get on the other side, somebody."
211,00:09:24.67,00:09:24.67,"- If you're weak, you can jog behind."
212,00:09:28.80,00:09:28.80,- Woo!
213,00:09:31.13,00:09:31.13,"- Steps, guys."
214,00:09:32.40,00:09:32.40,- Here we go: watch your step.
215,00:09:35.10,00:09:35.10,"- Feet up, feet up."
216,00:09:36.40,00:09:36.40,"- You're going to spin us around, right?"
217,00:09:37.50,00:09:37.50,- Right there in the hole.
218,00:09:39.13,00:09:39.13,Set it in the hole.
219,00:09:39.13,00:09:39.13,- Spin it.
220,00:09:39.97,00:09:39.97,- Let's go!
221,00:09:41.00,00:09:41.00,"- Everyone, go, put it up."
222,00:09:45.83,00:09:45.83,Help me up here!
223,00:09:48.17,00:09:48.17,"- Get it-- I got it, I got it."
224,00:09:49.80,00:09:49.80,- Help.
225,00:09:52.67,00:09:52.67,- Watch your hands.
226,00:09:54.83,00:09:54.83,"Up, got it."
227,00:09:56.27,00:09:56.27,- Got it!
228,00:09:58.93,00:09:58.93,- Wait up. Wait up.
229,00:10:00.67,00:10:00.67,- It's the same every time.
230,00:10:02.07,00:10:02.07,- Remember the course.
231,00:10:12.07,00:10:12.07,- Go!
232,00:10:16.43,00:10:16.43,- Over.
233,00:10:18.07,00:10:18.07,- Take a rest.
234,00:10:20.63,00:10:20.63,Take a rest.
235,00:10:24.13,00:10:24.13,"- Walk this, walk this."
236,00:10:31.90,00:10:31.90,(shouting orders)
237,00:10:34.73,00:10:34.73,"- There you go, there you go."
238,00:10:40.83,00:10:40.83,- (Probst) Make sure you stay together as a tribe.
239,00:10:46.93,00:10:46.93,"- Step, got it, you got it."
240,00:10:48.77,00:10:48.77,"- Go, go, go."
241,00:10:50.10,00:10:50.10,"- Come on, baby."
242,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,- Someone help with the back there.
243,00:10:55.60,00:10:55.60,- You go left.
244,00:10:58.13,00:10:58.13,- Ah!
245,00:10:59.77,00:10:59.77,"- Straight up, straight up, straight up."
246,00:11:03.07,00:11:03.07,- Woo!
247,00:11:04.73,00:11:04.73,"- Go, go, go."
248,00:11:06.90,00:11:06.90,- They're up.
249,00:11:08.50,00:11:08.50,"- This is light, now, guys."
250,00:11:12.90,00:11:12.90,"- Trust me, relax your legs, just let them follow the motion."
251,00:11:15.90,00:11:15.90,- (Probst) Make sure everybody
252,00:11:17.30,00:11:17.30,passes the line before it goes in the hole.
253,00:11:20.80,00:11:20.80,- Stand up.
254,00:11:20.80,00:11:20.80,- Go.
255,00:11:23.83,00:11:23.83,"- We've got to drag it back there, guys."
256,00:11:25.33,00:11:25.33,Drag it back.
257,00:11:26.67,00:11:26.67,"- This is it, guys."
258,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,"- Frank, get over!"
259,00:11:33.23,00:11:33.23,"- Go, go, go, go!"
260,00:11:35.13,00:11:35.13,- Woo!
261,00:11:36.50,00:11:36.50,- Step.
262,00:11:39.47,00:11:39.47,- Go!
263,00:11:48.00,00:11:48.00,- Who's running up to the top?
264,00:11:49.93,00:11:49.93,- Right here.
265,00:11:51.10,00:11:51.10,- Go now-- go!
266,00:11:54.27,00:11:54.27,- (Probst) You guys can't put
267,00:11:55.93,00:11:55.93,this in until all your tribe is here.
268,00:11:58.90,00:11:58.90,"- Come on, push! Push!"
269,00:12:05.17,00:12:05.17,- Give it to me.
270,00:12:11.50,00:12:11.50,- Push it in the hole.
271,00:12:14.50,00:12:14.50,- Get it up!
272,00:12:18.77,00:12:18.77,- (Probst) Two feet at the top.
273,00:12:22.60,00:12:22.60,( cheering )
274,00:12:23.73,00:12:23.73,Samburu!
275,00:12:26.27,00:12:26.27,- You kick ass!
276,00:12:28.10,00:12:28.10,"- (Probst) Nice job, guys."
277,00:12:39.57,00:12:39.57,- Samburu!
278,00:12:47.30,00:12:47.30,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
279,00:12:55.97,00:12:55.97,"- Kim, no regrets."
280,00:12:57.17,00:12:57.17,- No regrets.
281,00:12:58.20,00:12:58.20,"- No, as I say, it was my time"
282,00:13:00.37,00:13:00.37,"to, you know, basically screw up."
283,00:13:01.60,00:13:01.60,But I'm a competitor.
284,00:13:03.53,00:13:03.53,"I've competed all my life, and I just want you to know how bad"
285,00:13:05.63,00:13:05.63,I feel for this.
286,00:13:07.47,00:13:07.47,"And while I appreciate the great things you're saying, you guys"
287,00:13:10.00,00:13:10.00,would feel exactly the same.
288,00:13:11.33,00:13:11.33,"There's nothing more than that, you know."
289,00:13:13.80,00:13:13.80,"I tried to give it my best and it was my day to screw up, so..."
290,00:13:17.00,00:13:17.00,I'm sorry.
291,00:13:18.73,00:13:18.73,"- Well, I ain't worried about it."
292,00:13:19.73,00:13:19.73,This is just a game.
293,00:13:20.73,00:13:20.73,- I understand.
294,00:13:22.00,00:13:22.00,- And everybody has a boo-boo.
295,00:13:24.40,00:13:24.40,"Hey, I'm proud to be on your team."
296,00:13:26.30,00:13:26.30,"- Yeah, I agree."
297,00:13:27.70,00:13:27.70,- I'm feeling in a very vulnerable position
298,00:13:29.57,00:13:29.57,because I did fall.
299,00:13:31.07,00:13:31.07,You cannot help but be mad.
300,00:13:32.57,00:13:32.57,"You say the right words, you say to the person, ""Oh, it's okay,"""
301,00:13:35.97,00:13:35.97,"but you know what, it's not okay."
302,00:13:38.47,00:13:38.47,"All things being equal among us, it's a reason to vote me off."
303,00:13:55.90,00:13:55.90,- We almost went too long without water.
304,00:13:58.90,00:13:58.90,"I mean, your body just can't take it."
305,00:14:01.40,00:14:01.40,"A couple people, it's been a week,"
306,00:14:03.77,00:14:03.77,and there ain't nothing we can do about that.
307,00:14:07.80,00:14:07.80,We got two freeloaders.
308,00:14:10.03,00:14:10.03,It hurts.
309,00:14:16.90,00:14:16.90,- I don't know why I'm shaking.
310,00:14:18.33,00:14:18.33,I don't know if it's because of
311,00:14:20.00,00:14:20.00,lack of water or because I'm cold.
312,00:14:23.90,00:14:23.90,I'm probably the only one that hasn't had any water.
313,00:14:26.63,00:14:26.63,It's just very bad.
314,00:14:29.13,00:14:29.13,It's like tar.
315,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,I have to drink it.
316,00:14:33.37,00:14:33.37,I have to drink.
317,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,"God, I never thought drinking water would be so hard."
318,00:14:39.37,00:14:39.37,"- I think we're all worried about Jessie, throwing up when"
319,00:14:43.20,00:14:43.20,you have so little hydration to go around is bad.
320,00:14:46.20,00:14:46.20,"It's bad for her, it's bad for us."
321,00:14:48.50,00:14:48.50,- I think Jessie right now is-- I think she's hurting.
322,00:14:52.23,00:14:52.23,- I want to tell you that she's saying that she's all right.
323,00:14:55.03,00:14:55.03,- No one here is going to tell
324,00:14:56.73,00:14:56.73,whether or not they're feeling all right.
325,00:14:58.80,00:14:58.80,"If they're feeling sick, they don't want to show anybody that"
326,00:15:00.73,00:15:00.73,they're weak because they figure
327,00:15:02.07,00:15:02.07,we're just going to vote them off.
328,00:15:04.37,00:15:04.37,- I'll be the first to admit that the water does not taste
329,00:15:07.53,00:15:07.53,"great, but you just, you look past it because you need it."
330,00:15:12.13,00:15:12.13,"And not only that, if you don't drink it, how are you"
331,00:15:14.80,00:15:14.80,"physically going to help us in challenges, how are you"
332,00:15:17.47,00:15:17.47,"physically going to help us, you know, survive out here?"
333,00:15:20.07,00:15:20.07,Just-- it wears everybody else down because they have to pick
334,00:15:21.80,00:15:21.80,it up another notch.
335,00:15:23.03,00:15:23.03,- Are you hungry?
336,00:15:24.13,00:15:24.13,You have an appetite at all?
337,00:15:24.13,00:15:24.13,- No.
338,00:15:26.30,00:15:26.30,- But if you get a little flavor on your mouth it might
339,00:15:27.80,00:15:27.80,"change things, right?"
340,00:15:28.90,00:15:28.90,- I don't know.
341,00:15:30.37,00:15:30.37,"- All right, well, bye."
342,00:15:32.83,00:15:32.83,Just trying to help.
343,00:15:34.73,00:15:34.73,"- The guys are being really good, you know."
344,00:15:37.40,00:15:37.40,"They said it's okay, I mean, I don't know at this point."
345,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,I don't know.
346,00:15:59.83,00:15:59.83,You guys don't mind me not helping?
347,00:16:03.40,00:16:03.40,- Are you okay? You need help?
348,00:16:04.37,00:16:04.37,"- No, I'm fine."
349,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,"I wanted a seat, so I'm just"
350,00:16:06.80,00:16:06.80,"going to grab this, if that's okay."
351,00:16:08.50,00:16:08.50,- That's fine.
352,00:16:08.50,00:16:08.50,- Whatever.
353,00:16:10.63,00:16:10.63,"- It's the fourth day of the game, and things are starting to"
354,00:16:13.40,00:16:13.40,heat up a little bit.
355,00:16:15.50,00:16:15.50,I think everybody kind of
356,00:16:16.87,00:16:16.87,realizes the seriousness of the game.
357,00:16:19.23,00:16:19.23,"So, you know, what's being said and what's being done are"
358,00:16:21.73,00:16:21.73,just totally different things.
359,00:16:23.40,00:16:23.40,- You trust me?
360,00:16:24.73,00:16:24.73,- I trust you. I trusted you from day one.
361,00:16:26.83,00:16:26.83,- I was thinking and hoping
362,00:16:28.40,00:16:28.40,it wouldn't have come down to this so fast.
363,00:16:30.67,00:16:30.67,"But I really like the younger people, but I just feel like for"
364,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,"me to stay in the game as long as I can, I need to be on the"
365,00:16:37.37,00:16:37.37,"stronger side, and at this point"
366,00:16:38.53,00:16:38.53,"I feel like it's Carl, Frank, and Linda."
367,00:16:43.80,00:16:43.80,- (mumbling) ...you know what I'm saying?
368,00:16:48.07,00:16:48.07,- There's never a moment when someone is not trying to whisper
369,00:16:49.80,00:16:49.80,something in someone's ear.
370,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,"I mean, it's insane."
371,00:16:53.13,00:16:53.13,- See those guys on the grassy knoll over there?
372,00:16:55.00,00:16:55.00,It's a conspiracy.
373,00:16:56.70,00:16:56.70,"- Sitting around, watching groups of people kind of"
374,00:16:58.50,00:16:58.50,"whispering off to the side, you know, you get that little"
375,00:17:00.40,00:17:00.40,anxiety built up inside you.
376,00:17:02.60,00:17:02.60,- We've got to stick tight.
377,00:17:02.60,00:17:02.60,- Right.
378,00:17:03.87,00:17:03.87,"- No doubt, no question."
379,00:17:04.90,00:17:04.90,- Silence is the key.
380,00:17:05.97,00:17:05.97,- Silence is the key.
381,00:17:07.13,00:17:07.13,- Silence is the key.
382,00:17:08.17,00:17:08.17,- I'm not out there trying to
383,00:17:09.47,00:17:09.47,"get anybody hurt, but they have to understand."
384,00:17:10.73,00:17:10.73,They know what they signed up.
385,00:17:13.33,00:17:13.33,If they thought they signed up to go to the YMCA and roast
386,00:17:15.37,00:17:15.37,"marshmallows, and maybe win a million dollars, they're wrong."
387,00:17:18.13,00:17:18.13,- We're going for a water run.
388,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,We just need four people.
389,00:17:21.57,00:17:21.57,"Silas, come on, come on."
390,00:17:30.50,00:17:30.50,- Here's the deal.
391,00:17:33.13,00:17:33.13,"The allegiance with T, Frank and Linda and I... strong."
392,00:17:37.90,00:17:37.90,And we want you on our side.
393,00:17:41.47,00:17:41.47,- If the voting was to go along the lines of the youth and
394,00:17:43.87,00:17:43.87,"the older, obviously would be a tie."
395,00:17:46.17,00:17:46.17,We immediately began working on Silas.
396,00:17:48.70,00:17:48.70,"Silas is a strong, young man,"
397,00:17:50.70,00:17:50.70,physically great for the competition.
398,00:17:52.90,00:17:52.90,"Mentally too, he wants to be a winner."
399,00:17:54.87,00:17:54.87,He wants to go somewhere.
400,00:17:56.33,00:17:56.33,"The four of us have a common denominator, a goal."
401,00:17:59.47,00:17:59.47,"We wanted to make this work,"
402,00:18:00.93,00:18:00.93,"so we picked the strongest, and that was you."
403,00:18:05.07,00:18:05.07,"- You see a strong foursome here,"
404,00:18:06.30,00:18:06.30,you see a weak threesome here.
405,00:18:08.50,00:18:08.50,Where you going to put yourself?
406,00:18:10.00,00:18:10.00,He would be a complete fool and
407,00:18:11.47,00:18:11.47,an idiot not to stay with the type four.
408,00:18:14.23,00:18:14.23,"We like everybody, we all get along, but we got to face the"
409,00:18:16.87,00:18:16.87,"reality of what we're in, we're in a frigging game."
410,00:18:20.03,00:18:20.03,It's not a nice game at times.
411,00:18:21.50,00:18:21.50,Nobody is going to hate anybody.
412,00:18:22.83,00:18:22.83,"- No, I know what you mean."
413,00:18:23.83,00:18:23.83,- It's a chess match.
414,00:18:25.07,00:18:25.07,"- It is, man, I know."
415,00:18:26.33,00:18:26.33,"The strongest survive, I know the damn game."
416,00:18:28.83,00:18:28.83,Do you guys know Linda is for sure?
417,00:18:30.40,00:18:30.40,"- Linda is so concrete,"
418,00:18:32.00,00:18:32.00,she's buried in the bottom of the Hoover Dam.
419,00:18:37.57,00:18:37.57,"- You know, sometimes you can't be a nice guy."
420,00:18:39.70,00:18:39.70,"I mean, we're all here to win."
421,00:18:41.87,00:18:41.87,"And, you know, the nice guy"
422,00:18:44.00,00:18:44.00,"finishes last, and that's a fact."
423,00:18:46.20,00:18:46.20,It's done.
424,00:18:47.30,00:18:47.30,- What was that?
425,00:18:48.57,00:18:48.57,"- Strength and honor, baby."
426,00:18:49.57,00:18:49.57,"- You got it, buddy."
427,00:18:50.37,00:18:50.37,"- We're goin', bud."
428,00:18:51.87,00:18:51.87,"- Let's go home, guys."
429,00:19:16.83,00:19:16.83,- It's amazing how much water we need.
430,00:19:18.83,00:19:18.83,"You know, we haven't even thought about having water back"
431,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,at the place to wash with.
432,00:19:26.00,00:19:26.00,"- At home, getting water is like breathing."
433,00:19:28.80,00:19:28.80,You deserve it-- it's no big deal.
434,00:19:31.73,00:19:31.73,"In the bush, getting water is like receiving gold or platinum."
435,00:19:37.03,00:19:37.03,"Here water is life, water is everything because without it"
436,00:19:40.53,00:19:40.53,you are done like that.
437,00:19:43.50,00:19:43.50,"- The hardest thing I have to say is really, I'm unaccustomed"
438,00:19:46.90,00:19:46.90,to such physical drain.
439,00:19:49.53,00:19:49.53,"You know, I'm unaccustomed to having to work for my food,"
440,00:19:51.23,00:19:51.23,"you know, work for my water."
441,00:19:53.30,00:19:53.30,"Very unaccustomed to it, and that's been hard."
442,00:19:57.47,00:19:57.47,"- Okay, ready?"
443,00:20:04.97,00:20:04.97,"- I mean, we got three strong guys."
444,00:20:06.80,00:20:06.80,I think we can help.
445,00:20:07.90,00:20:07.90,"I mean, I brought that gourd today."
446,00:20:09.90,00:20:09.90,"It was empty, but I brought it empty."
447,00:20:11.87,00:20:11.87,It doesn't really weigh that much.
448,00:20:12.70,00:20:12.70,- Yeah.
449,00:20:13.90,00:20:13.90,- I think it's too heavy to carry back.
450,00:20:15.40,00:20:15.40,"- No, we won't be able to carry that back."
451,00:20:16.23,00:20:16.23,There's no way.
452,00:20:18.13,00:20:18.13,- But it wouldn't shock me to see if the guys all think that
453,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,they were trying to get rid of the girls altogether.
454,00:20:22.70,00:20:22.70,"- No, see, we can't let that happen."
455,00:20:24.20,00:20:24.20,"- Because they want to win the challenges,"
456,00:20:25.20,00:20:25.20,which is understandable.
457,00:20:26.73,00:20:26.73,But it wouldn't shock me if the four of them thought they could
458,00:20:28.87,00:20:28.87,do it better without any of us.
459,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50,- This game breeds paranoia.
460,00:20:35.13,00:20:35.13,"When two people go off in the distance, you instantly think"
461,00:20:37.70,00:20:37.70,they're talking about you.
462,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,"I'm like, maybe they're talking about me and trying to vote me"
463,00:20:43.20,00:20:43.20,off or something.
464,00:20:44.33,00:20:44.33,You have no idea.
465,00:20:57.03,00:20:57.03,"- You know, I hate having to talk about this stuff."
466,00:20:59.90,00:20:59.90,Tom and I talked this morning.
467,00:21:02.03,00:21:02.03,"He and I talked about our three-way, you know, agreement:"
468,00:21:05.30,00:21:05.30,"you, Kim and me."
469,00:21:07.07,00:21:07.07,"- You and Tom are like the two most honest guys, or what we"
470,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,"think is honest, I don't know."
471,00:21:12.90,00:21:12.90,You never know.
472,00:21:14.47,00:21:14.47,"- Well, Tom and I basically promised on our son's names."
473,00:21:16.83,00:21:16.83,That was enough for him and I.
474,00:21:18.33,00:21:18.33,"But, I mean, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
475,00:21:20.63,00:21:20.63,We're comfortable enough with you if you want to be part of it
476,00:21:23.87,00:21:23.87,to be making a long-term three-way alliance.
477,00:21:25.83,00:21:25.83,- There's no other way.
478,00:21:27.47,00:21:27.47,"I mean, if it's the three of us, and we don't cannibalize each"
479,00:21:30.23,00:21:30.23,other until it's three.
480,00:21:31.47,00:21:31.47,- Right.
481,00:21:32.67,00:21:32.67,- Everyone trusts Lex.
482,00:21:33.80,00:21:33.80,He's on everyone's team right now.
483,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,"He's on everyone's side, everyone likes him."
484,00:21:37.63,00:21:37.63,So it's very easy if you're in that position to push things
485,00:21:41.47,00:21:41.47,in one direction.
486,00:21:43.73,00:21:43.73,That's why I'm a little paranoid.
487,00:21:46.03,00:21:46.03,"For all I know, you know, Lex is playing both sides of the fence,"
488,00:21:48.37,00:21:48.37,"you know, Lex is plotting against me."
489,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,I have no idea.
490,00:21:51.67,00:21:51.67,- Get up on that horse.
491,00:21:53.20,00:21:53.20,"Yah, yah."
492,00:21:56.57,00:21:56.57,"Let me lead the way, turn around."
493,00:21:58.40,00:21:58.40,Let me get us home.
494,00:22:00.57,00:22:00.57,"You good, Clarence?"
495,00:22:02.03,00:22:02.03,- Yeah.
496,00:22:28.20,00:22:28.20,- Good to be back.
497,00:22:29.40,00:22:29.40,- How is the water?
498,00:22:31.03,00:22:31.03,"- Good, real good."
499,00:22:32.30,00:22:32.30,"- Good, good."
500,00:22:34.30,00:22:34.30,Yeah... yeah.
501,00:22:43.70,00:22:43.70,- Silas came back from the watering hole and I felt just
502,00:22:46.83,00:22:46.83,that little bit of apprehension and I just got kind of curious
503,00:22:50.00,00:22:50.00,"because I'm thinking, hmm..."
504,00:22:51.40,00:22:51.40,I just want to know what's going on.
505,00:22:53.53,00:22:53.53,"You know what, I'm not letting him stay out there alone."
506,00:22:56.20,00:22:56.20,- Go.
507,00:23:01.97,00:23:01.97,- It's got to be done right now.
508,00:23:03.87,00:23:03.87,- Lindsey's concerned already.
509,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,She knows people are talking.
510,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,- I know.
511,00:23:07.63,00:23:07.63,"Kimmy, if she whines, Brandon, he's out of here."
512,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,- You have to be careful when you talk like that.
513,00:23:14.83,00:23:14.83,So you're not overheard.
514,00:23:16.50,00:23:16.50,Lindsey overheard you.
515,00:23:17.73,00:23:17.73,- That's when the game really
516,00:23:19.63,00:23:19.63,"became real to me, you know?"
517,00:23:21.40,00:23:21.40,"I thought I was out here on a camping trip, just having a good"
518,00:23:24.37,00:23:24.37,"time with a bunch of friends, and to be honest, I don't think"
519,00:23:27.63,00:23:27.63,I trust anybody now.
520,00:23:30.30,00:23:30.30,- You ready?
521,00:23:31.30,00:23:31.30,- Firewood?
522,00:23:34.00,00:23:34.00,- There were some discussions.
523,00:23:35.73,00:23:35.73,The younger group overheard somehow.
524,00:23:37.73,00:23:37.73,We got sloppy and they began to panic.
525,00:23:40.57,00:23:40.57,"- It's just, you guys come back and you're all happy and chipper"
526,00:23:42.83,00:23:42.83,and you're conniving against us.
527,00:23:44.40,00:23:44.40,- Lindsey heard Frank say that Silas was on board with us.
528,00:23:47.00,00:23:47.00,- You heard that?
529,00:23:48.57,00:23:48.57,"- I heard every word of it, I was standing right there."
530,00:23:50.47,00:23:50.47,"- Of course, me being direct and not wanting to be dishonest,"
531,00:23:53.70,00:23:53.70,"all I could say was, yeah."
532,00:23:55.83,00:23:55.83,- She realized something was going on
533,00:23:56.90,00:23:56.90,because she caught me here.
534,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,- And Lindsey...
535,00:23:59.40,00:23:59.40,"- And she's with Silas now, so she knows something's up."
536,00:24:02.03,00:24:02.03,"- She's all upset, you can see it."
537,00:24:03.47,00:24:03.47,- Listen to me.
538,00:24:04.93,00:24:04.93,You better not get me voted out here.
539,00:24:06.13,00:24:06.13,"- Look at me, come on, damn it."
540,00:24:07.83,00:24:07.83,- I don't know.
541,00:24:07.83,00:24:07.83,- Trust me.
542,00:24:09.40,00:24:09.40,We have got to be able to knock people out.
543,00:24:11.33,00:24:11.33,I think Frank should go first.
544,00:24:12.73,00:24:12.73,We're going to take it all the way.
545,00:24:14.97,00:24:14.97,"Trust me, get Kim and Brandon to trust you."
546,00:24:17.13,00:24:17.13,- Are you telling this to everyone?
547,00:24:19.13,00:24:19.13,"No, I'm serious."
548,00:24:20.17,00:24:20.17,"- I have a lot riding on Silas,"
549,00:24:22.57,00:24:22.57,"and honestly, I have no other choice."
550,00:24:26.53,00:24:26.53,"- Trust me on this, all right?"
551,00:24:27.67,00:24:27.67,Do you trust me?
552,00:24:28.83,00:24:28.83,If you trust me.
553,00:24:30.07,00:24:30.07,"- Yeah, damn it, let's go, all right?"
554,00:24:32.07,00:24:32.07,- Who knows what Silas is really up to?
555,00:24:34.07,00:24:34.07,"For all I know, Silas is over"
556,00:24:35.57,00:24:35.57,there with them and we're all going to get screwed.
557,00:24:37.73,00:24:37.73,"You know, you just have to roll with the punches."
558,00:24:39.73,00:24:39.73,- I'll keep working on Silas.
559,00:24:41.23,00:24:41.23,"- Silas is fine, he's no dummy."
560,00:24:43.50,00:24:43.50,- Silas is on our team all the way.
561,00:24:46.07,00:24:46.07,He'll play the other people too
562,00:24:47.67,00:24:47.67,because he's going to go where he feels is the power.
563,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,But he's going to join us.
564,00:24:52.03,00:24:52.03,"Now, do I trust him? Hell, no."
565,00:24:54.03,00:24:54.03,- It's like this double face
566,00:24:55.80,00:24:55.80,thing you have to play while you're out here.
567,00:24:58.33,00:24:58.33,"It's funny, I mean, we're here to win a million dollars."
568,00:25:01.07,00:25:01.07,"So, I'm going to do what it takes to win."
569,00:25:03.03,00:25:03.03,"I don't know, it's interesting."
570,00:25:04.30,00:25:04.30,Things are changing all the time.
571,00:25:12.47,00:25:12.47,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
572,00:25:24.10,00:25:24.10,"- All right, let's see."
573,00:25:25.77,00:25:25.77,"Oh, ho."
574,00:25:27.97,00:25:27.97,Here we go.
575,00:25:29.40,00:25:29.40,"""You've all been affected by food not collected,"
576,00:25:33.70,00:25:33.70,"""so you're invited to our cafe."
577,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,"""You might be elected as the next one ejected, if you find"
578,00:25:40.10,00:25:40.10,"yourself saying, 'No way.'"""
579,00:25:41.90,00:25:41.90,It's a food one!
580,00:25:43.23,00:25:43.23,- It's a gross food challenge!
581,00:25:45.30,00:25:45.30,"- That's all right, I like that."
582,00:25:46.53,00:25:46.53,"- Bring it on, all right!"
583,00:25:48.63,00:25:48.63,"- I don't think anyone is squeamish, do you?"
584,00:25:51.20,00:25:51.20,"My one would be Jess, just because she doesn't feel well."
585,00:25:53.53,00:25:53.53,But as long as she gets it down.
586,00:25:54.60,00:25:54.60,- Yeah.
587,00:25:55.73,00:25:55.73,- Tree mail said that we have
588,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,our disgusting food challenge today.
589,00:25:59.40,00:25:59.40,There's nothing I won't eat.
590,00:26:00.50,00:26:00.50,"You know, it could be beef brain,"
591,00:26:02.93,00:26:02.93,"goat... testicles, whatever."
592,00:26:05.53,00:26:05.53,Sounds good-- breakfast.
593,00:26:07.60,00:26:07.60,"- ""You might be elected as the next one ejected if you find"
594,00:26:11.90,00:26:11.90,"yourself saying, 'No way.'"""
595,00:26:13.97,00:26:13.97,- Food!
596,00:26:15.53,00:26:15.53,- Yes!
597,00:26:16.87,00:26:16.87,"Yes, we can do this!"
598,00:26:18.90,00:26:18.90,- I'm excited.
599,00:26:18.90,00:26:18.90,- That's good!
600,00:26:20.53,00:26:20.53,- I don't think I could eat a dung beetle.
601,00:26:23.30,00:26:23.30,- Just don't think of them as dung beetles.
602,00:26:25.97,00:26:25.97,Think of them as beetles.
603,00:26:26.97,00:26:26.97,- I'll eat them right up.
604,00:26:29.80,00:26:29.80,- Winning today is really important because if we don't
605,00:26:32.63,00:26:32.63,"win, then I stand a good chance of being booted out of the tribe"
606,00:26:36.67,00:26:36.67,just due to the incidents that have happened
607,00:26:38.97,00:26:38.97,in the past three days.
608,00:26:40.23,00:26:40.23,"So, I have to eat everything."
609,00:26:42.00,00:26:42.00,I don't have a choice.
610,00:26:43.50,00:26:43.50,"I'll eat dirt right now, if you want me to,"

625,00:27:23.40,00:27:23.40,have feasted for thousands of years.
626,00:27:25.73,00:27:25.73,They don't really eat vegetables and they rarely eat meat.
627,00:27:28.77,00:27:28.77,"What they really rely on, milk from cattle and blood from"

645,00:28:37.07,00:28:37.07,The blood is completely clean.

818,00:36:05.77,00:36:05.77,sick and she hasn't done anything.
819,00:36:07.20,00:36:07.20,"But personally, I'll tell you right now,"
820,00:36:08.53,00:36:08.53,I'd vote him off before I voted one of the girls off.
821,00:36:11.13,00:36:11.13,"- Well, I'm just telling you face up, I voted against him"
822,00:36:14.00,00:36:14.00,the first time because I want him to know
823,00:36:16.60,00:36:16.60,it was a wake-up call for him.
824,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,"- Tribal Council is a huge drag for us,"
825,00:36:23.13,00:36:23.13,and we're going twice in a row.
826,00:36:25.03,00:36:25.03,"The first two Tribal Councils Boran is going both times,"
827,00:36:28.53,00:36:28.53,and none of us want to go.
828,00:37:03.27,00:37:03.27,"- (Probst) After having done this once,"
829,00:37:05.53,00:37:05.53,I know you don't want to be back here again tonight.
830,00:37:06.70,00:37:06.70,- No.
831,00:37:08.53,00:37:08.53,- Anybody want to own up that this is tougher than
832,00:37:10.83,00:37:10.83,"they thought, those first five minutes out of the truck?"
833,00:37:13.27,00:37:13.27,"- Oh, my God, I never expected anything to be this hard,"
834,00:37:17.13,00:37:17.13,especially the first couple days when we didn't have water and we
835,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,couldn't do anything about food and we had to eat
836,00:37:21.60,00:37:21.60,a lot of the canned food.
837,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,We weren't able to cook anything.
838,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,- Are you feeling better now?
839,00:37:24.77,00:37:24.77,"- Yeah, I'm feeling great."
840,00:37:26.13,00:37:26.13,"- (Probst) Lex, how big an issue six days in is trust?"
841,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,- Trust is probably one of the biggest issues of all.
842,00:37:33.80,00:37:33.80,"I mean, we all came here, eight of us, didn't know anything"
843,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,"about each other, and yet we found ourselves within the first"
844,00:37:41.83,00:37:41.83,day having to depend on each other for just the most
845,00:37:43.83,00:37:43.83,basic survival needs.
846,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,"If you can't trust the people that you're with,"
847,00:37:47.53,00:37:47.53,that's a problem.
848,00:37:49.13,00:37:49.13,"And given the fact that we have had a couple of speed bumps,"
849,00:37:52.20,00:37:52.20,it's made it harder moving ahead.
850,00:37:54.03,00:37:54.03,"- (Probst) Tom, you were very clear last time."
851,00:37:56.33,00:37:56.33,"You said, ""I forgive, but I don't forget."""
852,00:37:58.80,00:37:58.80,"- Just like a father figure, I told Clarence exactly what"
853,00:38:02.23,00:38:02.23,"I felt, and exactly what I thought."
854,00:38:04.60,00:38:04.60,We've done nothing but do better since then.
855,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,"I work closely with Clarence,"
856,00:38:10.20,00:38:10.20,and I think he's proven his self here.
857,00:38:13.53,00:38:13.53,"- (Probst) Clarence, got to ask you, sounds like you've redeemed"
858,00:38:16.53,00:38:16.53,yourself part of the way.
859,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,Are you still worried though that could come up tonight?
860,00:38:20.80,00:38:20.80,"- I think you got to put it in perspective, in that we've only"
861,00:38:24.53,00:38:24.53,been here for six days and that incident was freshly early.
862,00:38:27.97,00:38:27.97,All of our issues with regard
863,00:38:30.37,00:38:30.37,"to me, I believe, are in the past."
864,00:38:31.97,00:38:31.97,- Let's talk about who feels vulnerable.
865,00:38:33.80,00:38:33.80,"Kim, worried at all?"
866,00:38:34.83,00:38:34.83,"The reward challenge, a big"
867,00:38:36.53,00:38:36.53,reward and it was pretty clear you were dragging it.
868,00:38:39.50,00:38:39.50,"- That splat did me in, um... yeah, absolutely."
869,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,"All things being equal in every other area, you figure you go"
870,00:38:48.13,00:38:48.13,with the man at the time who basically messed up.
871,00:38:51.77,00:38:51.77,"So, you know, absolutely, I'm scared and I'm vulnerable."
872,00:38:54.93,00:38:54.93,"- Kelly, last question, you're here tonight."
873,00:38:57.80,00:38:57.80,"- Because of me, I know!"
874,00:39:00.40,00:39:00.40,It's awful.
875,00:39:01.43,00:39:01.43,I feel terrible.
876,00:39:02.90,00:39:02.90,"It sucks too, because it wasn't"
877,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,something I was unprepared to do.
878,00:39:06.43,00:39:06.43,It wasn't something I was incapable of.
879,00:39:08.03,00:39:08.03,"It's something I was excited for,"
880,00:39:09.40,00:39:09.40,"and I couldn't be more bummed, I feel awful."
881,00:39:11.77,00:39:11.77,It just sucks that it fell that way.
882,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,"- (Probst) Okay, it's time to vote."
883,00:39:15.33,00:39:15.33,Jessie.
884,00:39:27.17,00:39:27.17,- Last time I wanted to vote for Clarence and I didn't get
885,00:39:29.87,00:39:29.87,"the chance, so I figure tonight I'm going to set my piece and"
886,00:39:32.53,00:39:32.53,vote for the person who I really wanted to vote for last time.
887,00:39:48.67,00:39:48.67,"- I hate to lose her because she's so nice, but she's having"
888,00:39:52.67,00:39:52.67,"trouble holding up in these horrible, hard conditions and if"
889,00:39:55.77,00:39:55.77,"she's still like that on day five or six, I don't think"
890,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,she's going to be able to hold on for the long haul.
891,00:40:00.43,00:40:00.43,We need all the strength we can get.
892,00:40:25.67,00:40:25.67,"- I forgive, but I don't forget."
893,00:40:28.47,00:40:28.47,This is still another reminder.
894,00:40:37.50,00:40:37.50,- I'll go tally the votes.
895,00:40:57.20,00:40:57.20,"Once the votes have been read, the decision is final."
896,00:40:59.27,00:40:59.27,The person will be asked to
897,00:41:00.67,00:41:00.67,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
898,00:41:02.57,00:41:02.57,I'll read the votes.
899,00:41:07.40,00:41:07.40,First vote.
900,00:41:09.83,00:41:09.83,Jess.
901,00:41:15.53,00:41:15.53,Clarence.
902,00:41:20.97,00:41:20.97,Jessie.
903,00:41:25.80,00:41:25.80,"C.B., Clarence."
904,00:41:27.43,00:41:27.43,"Two votes Jessie, two votes Clarence."
905,00:41:34.33,00:41:34.33,Jessie.
906,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,It's four votes Jessie.
907,00:41:45.97,00:41:45.97,No need to read the last vote.
908,00:41:47.97,00:41:47.97,We'll leave that a mystery.
909,00:41:49.43,00:41:49.43,"You need to bring me your torch, Jessie."
910,00:42:03.83,00:42:03.83,"Jessie, the tribe has spoken."
911,00:42:08.73,00:42:08.73,It's time for you to go.
912,00:42:17.43,00:42:17.43,"Never is easy, is it?"
913,00:42:19.10,00:42:19.10,"Well, it does seem like you guys have bonded."
914,00:42:21.80,00:42:21.80,"Obviously, the next few challenges--"
915,00:42:24.37,00:42:24.37,critical for the Boran Tribe.
916,00:42:26.33,00:42:26.33,Get to camp and get some sleep.
917,00:42:28.03,00:42:28.03,I'll see you tomorrow.
918,00:42:51.37,00:42:51.37,- (Probst) Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
919,00:42:58.67,00:42:58.67,- (Probst) Next time on   Survivor:
920,00:43:00.33,00:43:00.33, Boran has some unwelcome visitors.
921,00:43:02.27,00:43:02.27,- Go away!
922,00:43:03.77,00:43:03.77,"- My mind said stay, but my feet said go."
923,00:43:06.67,00:43:06.67,- Lindsey pushes herself beyond her limit.
924,00:43:08.70,00:43:08.70,- I could take a broken bone over this.
925,00:43:11.53,00:43:11.53,- Lindsey likes to say how strong she is.
926,00:43:14.13,00:43:14.13,Guess she's not so strong.
927,00:43:15.80,00:43:15.80,- And Boran strips down to the bare essentials.
928,00:43:24.43,00:43:24.43,- I know why the guys made the decision they made.
929,00:43:26.47,00:43:26.47,"Obviously, they felt that they"
930,00:43:29.13,00:43:29.13,needed Clarence to stay in the challenge.
931,00:43:32.67,00:43:32.67,He's a little bit stronger than me anyway.
932,00:43:35.90,00:43:35.90,"And that's the decision they made, and I am okay with that."
933,00:43:40.30,00:43:40.30,And I just wanted to tell Tom that I love him.
