12,00:00:20.03,00:00:20.03,The water is disgusting.

14,00:00:21.93,00:00:21.93,- We'll have to boil it.
15,00:00:24.03,00:00:24.03,You end up with dysentery whichbasically has you puking and
16,00:00:27.40,00:00:27.40,crapping your guts out.

21,00:00:36.30,00:00:36.30,"Back at the Boran camp, Clarencewas in hot water for sharing a"
22,00:00:39.73,00:00:39.73,can of beans with Dianewhile the others were away.
23,00:00:42.57,00:00:42.57,"- Tommy, Tommy..."
24,00:00:43.63,00:00:43.63,I had to open itfor her.
25,00:00:45.10,00:00:45.10,- You ain't no doctor.

27,00:00:47.93,00:00:47.93,"Clarence paid for hisactions by receiving votes,"
28,00:00:50.70,00:00:50.70,but Diane was the first onevoted out of the tribe.
29,00:00:53.63,00:00:53.63,15 are left.
30,00:00:55.40,00:00:55.40,Who will be voted outtonight?
31,00:00:57.73,00:00:57.73,♪♪
32,00:02:22.50,00:02:22.50,- Going to Tribal Council
33,00:02:23.93,00:02:23.93,is like going to hell for 45minutes.
34,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,"It's hot, it's uncomfortable,"
35,00:02:29.77,00:02:29.77,and nothing good is going tohappen while you're there.
36,00:02:34.43,00:02:34.43,- Did you put your torch there?
37,00:02:36.93,00:02:36.93,"- Yeah, I'm going togo put it away."
38,00:02:38.47,00:02:38.47,"- Well, it was tough."
39,00:02:39.83,00:02:39.83,It was tough on all of us.
40,00:02:44.77,00:02:44.77,- Having your name read byJeff is horrible.
41,00:02:47.17,00:02:47.17,"There wasa sinking feeling,"
42,00:02:48.77,00:02:48.77,like I can't believe this ishappening.
43,00:02:52.07,00:02:52.07,- Despite the fact that all ofus had agreed that we are all
44,00:02:54.73,00:02:54.73,"going to vote unanimously forDiane, we thought it was a"
45,00:02:56.93,00:02:56.93,really good opportunity for oneof us to vote for Clarence just
46,00:03:01.03,00:03:01.03,to teach him a lesson and justso he knows that he's on shaky
47,00:03:04.97,00:03:04.97,ground and that he needs toshape up.
48,00:03:10.80,00:03:10.80,- I'm just trying to explain toyou that I wouldn't stop to
49,00:03:13.57,00:03:13.57,"Diane, and she turnedaround and bit me."
50,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,"All she did wastell me, you know,"
51,00:03:17.30,00:03:17.30,"""You're my only friendhere."""
52,00:03:18.33,00:03:18.33,- So what do you think?
53,00:03:19.43,00:03:19.43,Did she try to screw you?
54,00:03:20.60,00:03:20.60,- I think she knew.
55,00:03:21.60,00:03:21.60,"She knew that she madebad waves,"
56,00:03:22.83,00:03:22.83,"and she looking forsomebody to scapegoat,"
57,00:03:25.13,00:03:25.13,and she almost had me.
58,00:03:26.27,00:03:26.27,"- Well, I don't know,Clarence."
59,00:03:28.63,00:03:28.63,It was nota very good time.
60,00:03:30.73,00:03:30.73,You shouldn't have done thatin the first place.
61,00:03:34.23,00:03:34.23,"- You know, that's my own fault,for being too nice."
62,00:03:37.63,00:03:37.63,- He's very nervous.
63,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,He was shaking.
64,00:03:40.67,00:03:40.67,"He came up to me, and, like, waslooking for my approval on how I"
65,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,"felt about him and what he haddone, and it felt like he needed"
66,00:03:49.07,00:03:49.07,me to tell him that he wasgoing to be okay.
67,00:03:51.63,00:03:51.63,"- But I'm saying,I didn't do (...) wrong."
68,00:03:53.93,00:03:53.93,- You openeda can of beans.
69,00:03:55.27,00:03:55.27,"- Yeah, yeah, you're right,you're right."

71,00:03:58.30,00:03:58.30,"- You're right,you're right."
72,00:03:59.73,00:03:59.73,"- Come on,you made a bad call."
73,00:04:01.07,00:04:01.07,"- All right, that's fair."
74,00:04:02.30,00:04:02.30,- You're going to havea fair chance.
75,00:04:03.93,00:04:03.93,You don't have toworry about that.
76,00:04:05.17,00:04:05.17,- I'm not worriedabout the game.
77,00:04:06.47,00:04:06.47,- You are worried aboutthe game.
78,00:04:07.60,00:04:07.60,You are worriedabout the game.
79,00:04:08.67,00:04:08.67,Don't sit here and tell me
80,00:04:10.23,00:04:10.23,you're not worriedabout the game.
81,00:04:11.47,00:04:11.47,"- All right, I'm worried aboutthe game, but..."
82,00:04:12.57,00:04:12.57,- You are worriedabout the game.
83,00:04:14.63,00:04:14.63,"- We were presented with anunfortunate situation, but we"
84,00:04:18.13,00:04:18.13,"turned around, and it ended upworking really in our favor,"
85,00:04:21.23,00:04:21.23,because now everybody knowsexactly what Clarence is about.
86,00:04:24.10,00:04:24.10,He can't hide anymore.
87,00:04:41.73,00:04:41.73,"- Man, everything aches."
88,00:04:44.10,00:04:44.10,- Everything aches.
89,00:04:45.77,00:04:45.77,- Sleeping on the ground isgetting really tough.
90,00:04:48.67,00:04:48.67,It's a lot colder than I thoughtit was going to be at night.
91,00:04:51.47,00:04:51.47,I've shivered bothnights straight through
92,00:04:53.00,00:04:53.00,the whole entire night.
93,00:04:54.63,00:04:54.63,- I'll never complain againabout a lumpy bed in a motel.
94,00:04:58.23,00:04:58.23,- The comfort level sleeping isdefinitely something that we
95,00:05:01.80,00:05:01.80,could use alittle bit more of.
96,00:05:03.60,00:05:03.60,I don't think one person hasgotten a good night's sleep
97,00:05:06.40,00:05:06.40,"since we've been here,so that's tough."
98,00:05:13.40,00:05:13.40,- It's amazing how hot it isduring the day.
99,00:05:16.67,00:05:16.67,So we worked on a shelterbecause we knew we really needed
100,00:05:18.77,00:05:18.77,to get under the shade.
101,00:05:20.40,00:05:20.40,"We don't really have any shadein there, and the sun is so hot,"
102,00:05:23.30,00:05:23.30,so we started to build a roofacross the top.
103,00:05:24.73,00:05:24.73,- Lindsey.
104,00:05:24.73,00:05:24.73,- Yeah?
105,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,We're going to tear the doorapart and save all the materials
106,00:05:28.90,00:05:28.90,over to the sideoutside the hut.
107,00:05:30.30,00:05:30.30,- Okay.
108,00:05:31.67,00:05:31.67,"Yes, Captain."
109,00:05:33.27,00:05:33.27,"- Frank is a reallyinteresting character, but"
110,00:05:35.97,00:05:35.97,"really for the military, youknow, he barks orders and he"
111,00:05:39.40,00:05:39.40,"just wants things to be done,kind of right now, his way."
112,00:05:42.57,00:05:42.57,"- We'll go right here in tothis corner, and we'll tie into"
113,00:05:45.27,00:05:45.27,that corner and over tothat large one there.
114,00:05:47.40,00:05:47.40,"- Water, excuse me."
115,00:05:49.27,00:05:49.27,I can't speak.
116,00:05:50.73,00:05:50.73,- I've been workingmy buns off.
117,00:05:52.97,00:05:52.97,"Frank's been working hisbuns off, and we're always"
118,00:05:55.73,00:05:55.73,thinking the next step ahead
119,00:05:57.30,00:05:57.30,because other peopledon't do that.
120,00:05:59.10,00:05:59.10,- This is where you're going tocome in to the shade.
121,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,He's going to bepushing that in.
122,00:06:02.47,00:06:02.47,"- What do you think,Lindsay, Kim... input?"
123,00:06:04.83,00:06:04.83,- I say you all give me a joband I'll get up on it.
124,00:06:08.57,00:06:08.57,- The youth were out herelike on a vacation.
125,00:06:11.77,00:06:11.77,"They just straggle here orthere, you know, whether it's"
126,00:06:14.97,00:06:14.97,"their way of making us do allthe work, Carl and myself,"
127,00:06:18.57,00:06:18.57,we have to just jump inthere and do something.
128,00:06:21.57,00:06:21.57,"You know, Linda and Teresa--usually don't have to ask them."
129,00:06:24.93,00:06:24.93,"They're up,""What can we do?"""
130,00:06:27.67,00:06:27.67,- We're almost like twocompletely different teams.
131,00:06:30.67,00:06:30.67,For some reason our campis split
132,00:06:33.10,00:06:33.10,right downthe middle by age.
133,00:06:35.13,00:06:35.13,"- That's good,that works."
134,00:06:37.60,00:06:37.60,- This is nice.
135,00:06:39.67,00:06:39.67,"- I would like to see thesedifferences overcome, but if it"
136,00:06:42.07,00:06:42.07,happens the way I have this gutfeeling it's going to happen and
137,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,"someone's got to be votedout, I have no problem with it."
138,00:06:47.40,00:06:47.40,There's one or two individuals Icould get rid of right now that
139,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,are probably more in the waythan are any good.
140,00:06:57.50,00:06:57.50,"- Oh, this isthe mail route."
141,00:06:59.13,00:06:59.13,This is the first timeI've been here.
142,00:07:00.53,00:07:00.53,- This is it.
143,00:07:04.10,00:07:04.10,There's a necklacein here with a message.
144,00:07:07.33,00:07:07.33,"""Go straight to the topfor prizes sublime."
145,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,"""The way to succeedis one step at a time."
146,00:07:15.10,00:07:15.10,"""You can't do it alone,you must work as one,"
147,00:07:18.27,00:07:18.27,"or disappointment awaits whenthe challenge is done."""
148,00:07:22.80,00:07:22.80,- What else is in here?That's it?
149,00:07:25.80,00:07:25.80,"- ""You can't do it alone."

151,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,"or disappointment awaits whenthe challenge is done."""
152,00:07:30.97,00:07:30.97,- Maybe it's rock climbing.
153,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,"- Ooh, that would be cool."
154,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,- Ooh.
155,00:07:33.97,00:07:33.97,- We should probably thinkabout what we want because
156,00:07:36.13,00:07:36.13,looks like one of those thingswhere they might give us
157,00:07:38.63,00:07:38.63,a choice of what wewant more than anything else.
158,00:07:40.67,00:07:40.67,"- I still say blankets, Ithink, on the basic needs level."
159,00:07:43.00,00:07:43.00,- Bedding?
160,00:07:44.07,00:07:44.07,"- Bedding,yeah, it has been"
161,00:07:45.10,00:07:45.10,hard to get comfortablesleeping.
162,00:07:46.83,00:07:46.83,"- Well, I've felt better,but I guess I've felt worse."
163,00:07:49.90,00:07:49.90,We'll open this can of whoop-assand see what happens.
164,00:07:52.60,00:07:52.60,- There you go.

278,00:12:55.97,00:12:55.97,"- Kim, no regrets."
279,00:12:57.17,00:12:57.17,- No regrets.
280,00:12:58.20,00:12:58.20,"- No, as I say,it was my time"
281,00:13:00.37,00:13:00.37,"to, you know,basically screw up."
282,00:13:01.60,00:13:01.60,But I'm a competitor.
283,00:13:03.53,00:13:03.53,"I've competed all my life, and Ijust want you to know how bad"
284,00:13:05.63,00:13:05.63,I feel for this.
285,00:13:07.47,00:13:07.47,"And while I appreciate the greatthings you're saying, you guys"
286,00:13:10.00,00:13:10.00,would feel exactly the same.
287,00:13:11.33,00:13:11.33,"There's nothingmore than that, you know."
288,00:13:13.80,00:13:13.80,"I tried to give it my best andit was my day to screw up, so..."
289,00:13:17.00,00:13:17.00,I'm sorry.
290,00:13:18.73,00:13:18.73,"- Well, I ain'tworried about it."
291,00:13:19.73,00:13:19.73,This is just a game.
292,00:13:20.73,00:13:20.73,- I understand.
293,00:13:22.00,00:13:22.00,- And everybody hasa boo-boo.
294,00:13:24.40,00:13:24.40,"Hey, I'm proudto be on your team."
295,00:13:26.30,00:13:26.30,"- Yeah, I agree."
296,00:13:27.70,00:13:27.70,- I'm feeling in a veryvulnerable position
297,00:13:29.57,00:13:29.57,because I did fall.
298,00:13:31.07,00:13:31.07,You cannot help but be mad.
299,00:13:32.57,00:13:32.57,"You say the right words, you sayto the person, ""Oh, it's okay,"""
300,00:13:35.97,00:13:35.97,"but you know what,it's not okay."
301,00:13:38.47,00:13:38.47,"All things being equal among us,it's a reason to vote me off."
302,00:13:55.90,00:13:55.90,- We almost went too longwithout water.
303,00:13:58.90,00:13:58.90,"I mean, your bodyjust can't take it."
304,00:14:01.40,00:14:01.40,"A couple people,it's been a week,"
305,00:14:03.77,00:14:03.77,and there ain't nothing wecan do about that.
306,00:14:07.80,00:14:07.80,We got two freeloaders.
307,00:14:10.03,00:14:10.03,It hurts.
308,00:14:16.90,00:14:16.90,- I don't knowwhy I'm shaking.
309,00:14:18.33,00:14:18.33,I don't know if it'sbecause of
310,00:14:20.00,00:14:20.00,lack of wateror because I'm cold.
311,00:14:23.90,00:14:23.90,I'm probably the only one thathasn't had any water.
312,00:14:26.63,00:14:26.63,It's just very bad.
313,00:14:29.13,00:14:29.13,It's like tar.
314,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,I have to drink it.
315,00:14:33.37,00:14:33.37,I have to drink.
316,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,"God, I never thought drinkingwater would be so hard."
317,00:14:39.37,00:14:39.37,"- I think we're all worriedabout Jessie, throwing up when"
318,00:14:43.20,00:14:43.20,you have so little hydration togo around is bad.
319,00:14:46.20,00:14:46.20,"It's bad for her,it's bad for us."
320,00:14:48.50,00:14:48.50,- I think Jessie right now is--I think she's hurting.
321,00:14:52.23,00:14:52.23,- I want to tell you that she'ssaying that she's all right.
322,00:14:55.03,00:14:55.03,- No one hereis going to tell
323,00:14:56.73,00:14:56.73,whether or not they'refeeling all right.
324,00:14:58.80,00:14:58.80,"If they're feeling sick, theydon't want to show anybody that"
325,00:15:00.73,00:15:00.73,they're weakbecause they figure
326,00:15:02.07,00:15:02.07,we're just going tovote them off.
327,00:15:04.37,00:15:04.37,- I'll be the first to admitthat the water does not taste
328,00:15:07.53,00:15:07.53,"great, but you just, you lookpast it because you need it."
329,00:15:12.13,00:15:12.13,"And not only that, if youdon't drink it, how are you"
330,00:15:14.80,00:15:14.80,"physically going to help us inchallenges, how are you"
331,00:15:17.47,00:15:17.47,"physically going to help us,you know, survive out here?"
332,00:15:20.07,00:15:20.07,Just-- it wears everybody elsedown because they have to pick
333,00:15:21.80,00:15:21.80,it up another notch.
334,00:15:23.03,00:15:23.03,- Are you hungry?
335,00:15:24.13,00:15:24.13,You have an appetite at all?
336,00:15:24.13,00:15:24.13,- No.
337,00:15:26.30,00:15:26.30,- But if you get a littleflavor on your mouth it might
338,00:15:27.80,00:15:27.80,"change things, right?"
339,00:15:28.90,00:15:28.90,- I don't know.
340,00:15:30.37,00:15:30.37,"- All right,well, bye."
341,00:15:32.83,00:15:32.83,Just trying to help.
342,00:15:34.73,00:15:34.73,"- The guys are being reallygood, you know."
343,00:15:37.40,00:15:37.40,"They said it's okay, I mean,I don't know at this point."
344,00:15:42.20,00:15:42.20,I don't know.
345,00:15:59.83,00:15:59.83,You guys don't mind menot helping?
346,00:16:03.40,00:16:03.40,- Are you okay?You need help?
347,00:16:04.37,00:16:04.37,"- No, I'm fine."
348,00:16:05.67,00:16:05.67,"I wanteda seat, so I'm just"
349,00:16:06.80,00:16:06.80,"going to grab this,if that's okay."
350,00:16:08.50,00:16:08.50,- That's fine.
351,00:16:08.50,00:16:08.50,- Whatever.
352,00:16:10.63,00:16:10.63,"- It's the fourth day of thegame, and things are starting to"
353,00:16:13.40,00:16:13.40,heat up a little bit.
354,00:16:15.50,00:16:15.50,I think everybody kind of
355,00:16:16.87,00:16:16.87,realizes the seriousnessof the game.
356,00:16:19.23,00:16:19.23,"So, you know, what's being saidand what's being done are"
357,00:16:21.73,00:16:21.73,just totallydifferent things.
358,00:16:23.40,00:16:23.40,- You trust me?
359,00:16:24.73,00:16:24.73,- I trust you.I trusted you from day one.
360,00:16:26.83,00:16:26.83,- I was thinking and hoping
361,00:16:28.40,00:16:28.40,it wouldn't have come downto this so fast.
362,00:16:30.67,00:16:30.67,"But I really like the youngerpeople, but I just feel like for"
363,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,"me to stay in the game as longas I can, I need to be on the"
364,00:16:37.37,00:16:37.37,"stronger side,and at this point"
365,00:16:38.53,00:16:38.53,"I feel like it's Carl,Frank, and Linda."
366,00:16:43.80,00:16:43.80,- (mumbling)...you know what I'm saying?
367,00:16:48.07,00:16:48.07,- There's never a moment whensomeone is not trying to whisper
368,00:16:49.80,00:16:49.80,something in someone's ear.
369,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,"I mean, it's insane."
370,00:16:53.13,00:16:53.13,- See those guys on the grassyknoll over there?
371,00:16:55.00,00:16:55.00,It's a conspiracy.
372,00:16:56.70,00:16:56.70,"- Sitting around, watchinggroups of people kind of"
373,00:16:58.50,00:16:58.50,"whispering off to the side,you know, you get that little"
374,00:17:00.40,00:17:00.40,anxiety built up inside you.
375,00:17:02.60,00:17:02.60,- We've got to stick tight.
376,00:17:02.60,00:17:02.60,- Right.
377,00:17:03.87,00:17:03.87,"- No doubt, no question."
378,00:17:04.90,00:17:04.90,- Silence is the key.
379,00:17:05.97,00:17:05.97,- Silence is the key.
380,00:17:07.13,00:17:07.13,- Silence is the key.
381,00:17:08.17,00:17:08.17,- I'm not out theretrying to
382,00:17:09.47,00:17:09.47,"get anybody hurt,but they have to understand."
383,00:17:10.73,00:17:10.73,They know whatthey signed up.
384,00:17:13.33,00:17:13.33,If they thought they signed upto go to the YMCA and roast
385,00:17:15.37,00:17:15.37,"marshmallows, and maybe win amillion dollars, they're wrong."
386,00:17:18.13,00:17:18.13,- We're going fora water run.
387,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,We just need four people.
388,00:17:21.57,00:17:21.57,"Silas, come on,come on."
389,00:17:30.50,00:17:30.50,- Here's the deal.
390,00:17:33.13,00:17:33.13,"The allegiance with T, Frank andLinda and I... strong."
391,00:17:37.90,00:17:37.90,And we wantyou on our side.
392,00:17:41.47,00:17:41.47,- If the voting was to go alongthe lines of the youth and
393,00:17:43.87,00:17:43.87,"the older,obviously would be a tie."
394,00:17:46.17,00:17:46.17,We immediately beganworking on Silas.
395,00:17:48.70,00:17:48.70,"Silas isa strong, young man,"
396,00:17:50.70,00:17:50.70,physically great for thecompetition.
397,00:17:52.90,00:17:52.90,"Mentally too,he wants to be a winner."
398,00:17:54.87,00:17:54.87,He wants togo somewhere.
399,00:17:56.33,00:17:56.33,"The four of us have a commondenominator, a goal."
400,00:17:59.47,00:17:59.47,"We wanted tomake this work,"
401,00:18:00.93,00:18:00.93,"so we picked the strongest,and that was you."
402,00:18:05.07,00:18:05.07,"- You see a strongfoursome here,"
403,00:18:06.30,00:18:06.30,you seea weak threesome here.
404,00:18:08.50,00:18:08.50,Where you going toput yourself?
405,00:18:10.00,00:18:10.00,He would bea complete fool and
406,00:18:11.47,00:18:11.47,an idiot not to stay withthe type four.
407,00:18:14.23,00:18:14.23,"We like everybody, we all getalong, but we got to face the"
408,00:18:16.87,00:18:16.87,"reality of what we're in,we're in a frigging game."
409,00:18:20.03,00:18:20.03,It's nota nice game at times.
410,00:18:21.50,00:18:21.50,Nobody is goingto hate anybody.
411,00:18:22.83,00:18:22.83,"- No, I knowwhat you mean."
412,00:18:23.83,00:18:23.83,- It's a chess match.
413,00:18:25.07,00:18:25.07,"- It is, man,I know."
414,00:18:26.33,00:18:26.33,"The strongest survive,I know the damn game."
415,00:18:28.83,00:18:28.83,Do you guysknow Linda is for sure?
416,00:18:30.40,00:18:30.40,"- Linda is so concrete,"
417,00:18:32.00,00:18:32.00,she's buried in the bottomof the Hoover Dam.
418,00:18:37.57,00:18:37.57,"- You know, sometimes youcan't be a nice guy."
419,00:18:39.70,00:18:39.70,"I mean,we're all here to win."
420,00:18:41.87,00:18:41.87,"And, you know,the nice guy"
421,00:18:44.00,00:18:44.00,"finishes last,and that's a fact."
422,00:18:46.20,00:18:46.20,It's done.
423,00:18:47.30,00:18:47.30,- What was that?
424,00:18:48.57,00:18:48.57,"- Strengthand honor, baby."
425,00:18:49.57,00:18:49.57,"- You got it, buddy."
426,00:18:50.37,00:18:50.37,"- We're goin', bud."
427,00:18:51.87,00:18:51.87,"- Let's go home, guys."
428,00:19:16.83,00:19:16.83,- It's amazing how muchwater we need.
429,00:19:18.83,00:19:18.83,"You know, we haven't eventhought about having water back"
430,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,at the place to wash with.
431,00:19:26.00,00:19:26.00,"- At home, getting wateris like breathing."
432,00:19:28.80,00:19:28.80,You deserve it--it's no big deal.
433,00:19:31.73,00:19:31.73,"In the bush, getting water islike receiving gold or platinum."
434,00:19:37.03,00:19:37.03,"Here water is life, water iseverything because without it"
435,00:19:40.53,00:19:40.53,you are done like that.
436,00:19:43.50,00:19:43.50,"- The hardest thing I have tosay is really, I'm unaccustomed"
437,00:19:46.90,00:19:46.90,to such physical drain.
438,00:19:49.53,00:19:49.53,"You know, I'm unaccustomed tohaving to work for my food,"
439,00:19:51.23,00:19:51.23,"you know, work formy water."
440,00:19:53.30,00:19:53.30,"Very unaccustomed to it,and that's been hard."
441,00:19:57.47,00:19:57.47,"- Okay, ready?"
442,00:20:04.97,00:20:04.97,"- I mean,we got three strong guys."
443,00:20:06.80,00:20:06.80,I think we can help.
444,00:20:07.90,00:20:07.90,"I mean, I broughtthat gourd today."
445,00:20:09.90,00:20:09.90,"It was empty, but I broughtit empty."
446,00:20:11.87,00:20:11.87,It doesn't reallyweigh that much.
447,00:20:12.70,00:20:12.70,- Yeah.
448,00:20:13.90,00:20:13.90,- I think it's too heavyto carry back.
449,00:20:15.40,00:20:15.40,"- No, we won't beable to carry that back."
450,00:20:16.23,00:20:16.23,There's no way.
451,00:20:18.13,00:20:18.13,- But it wouldn't shock me tosee if the guys all think that
452,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,they were trying to get rid ofthe girls altogether.
453,00:20:22.70,00:20:22.70,"- No, see, we can'tlet that happen."
454,00:20:24.20,00:20:24.20,"- Because theywant to win the challenges,"
455,00:20:25.20,00:20:25.20,which isunderstandable.
456,00:20:26.73,00:20:26.73,But it wouldn't shock me if thefour of them thought they could
457,00:20:28.87,00:20:28.87,do it betterwithout any of us.
458,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50,- This game breeds paranoia.
459,00:20:35.13,00:20:35.13,"When two people go off in thedistance, you instantly think"
460,00:20:37.70,00:20:37.70,they're talking about you.
461,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,"I'm like, maybe they're talkingabout me and trying to vote me"
462,00:20:43.20,00:20:43.20,off or something.
463,00:20:44.33,00:20:44.33,You have no idea.
464,00:20:57.03,00:20:57.03,"- You know, I hate having totalk about this stuff."
465,00:20:59.90,00:20:59.90,Tom and Italked this morning.
466,00:21:02.03,00:21:02.03,"He and I talked about ourthree-way, you know, agreement:"
467,00:21:05.30,00:21:05.30,"you, Kim and me."
468,00:21:07.07,00:21:07.07,"- You and Tom are like the twomost honest guys, or what we"
469,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,"think is honest,I don't know."
470,00:21:12.90,00:21:12.90,You never know.
471,00:21:14.47,00:21:14.47,"- Well, Tom and I basicallypromised on our son's names."
472,00:21:16.83,00:21:16.83,That was enoughfor him and I.
473,00:21:18.33,00:21:18.33,"But, I mean, that's what Iwanted to talk to you about."
474,00:21:20.63,00:21:20.63,We're comfortable enough withyou if you want to be part of it
475,00:21:23.87,00:21:23.87,to be making a long-termthree-way alliance.
476,00:21:25.83,00:21:25.83,- There's no other way.
477,00:21:27.47,00:21:27.47,"I mean, if it's the three of us,and we don't cannibalize each"
478,00:21:30.23,00:21:30.23,other until it's three.
479,00:21:31.47,00:21:31.47,- Right.
480,00:21:32.67,00:21:32.67,- Everyone trusts Lex.
481,00:21:33.80,00:21:33.80,He's on everyone'steam right now.
482,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,"He's on everyone's side,everyone likes him."
483,00:21:37.63,00:21:37.63,So it's very easy if you'rein that position to push things
484,00:21:41.47,00:21:41.47,in one direction.
485,00:21:43.73,00:21:43.73,That's why I'm a littleparanoid.
486,00:21:46.03,00:21:46.03,"For all I know, you know, Lex isplaying both sides of the fence,"
487,00:21:48.37,00:21:48.37,"you know, Lex is plottingagainst me."
488,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,I have no idea.
489,00:21:51.67,00:21:51.67,- Get up on that horse.
490,00:21:53.20,00:21:53.20,"Yah, yah."
491,00:21:56.57,00:21:56.57,"Let me lead the way,turn around."
492,00:21:58.40,00:21:58.40,Let me get us home.
493,00:22:00.57,00:22:00.57,"You good, Clarence?"
494,00:22:02.03,00:22:02.03,- Yeah.
495,00:22:28.20,00:22:28.20,- Good to be back.
496,00:22:29.40,00:22:29.40,- How is the water?
497,00:22:31.03,00:22:31.03,"- Good, real good."
498,00:22:32.30,00:22:32.30,"- Good, good."
499,00:22:34.30,00:22:34.30,Yeah... yeah.
500,00:22:43.70,00:22:43.70,- Silas came back from thewatering hole and I felt just
501,00:22:46.83,00:22:46.83,that little bit of apprehensionand I just got kind of curious
502,00:22:50.00,00:22:50.00,"because I'mthinking, hmm..."
503,00:22:51.40,00:22:51.40,I just want to knowwhat's going on.
504,00:22:53.53,00:22:53.53,"You know what, I'm not lettinghim stay out there alone."
505,00:22:56.20,00:22:56.20,- Go.
506,00:23:01.97,00:23:01.97,- It's got to be doneright now.
507,00:23:03.87,00:23:03.87,- Lindsey'sconcerned already.
508,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,She knows people are talking.
509,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,- I know.
510,00:23:07.63,00:23:07.63,"Kimmy, if she whines, Brandon,he's out of here."
511,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,- You have to be carefulwhen you talk like that.
512,00:23:14.83,00:23:14.83,So you're not overheard.
513,00:23:16.50,00:23:16.50,Lindsey overheard you.
514,00:23:17.73,00:23:17.73,- That's when the game really
515,00:23:19.63,00:23:19.63,"became real to me, you know?"
516,00:23:21.40,00:23:21.40,"I thought I was out here on acamping trip, just having a good"
517,00:23:24.37,00:23:24.37,"time with a bunch of friends,and to be honest, I don't think"
518,00:23:27.63,00:23:27.63,I trust anybody now.
519,00:23:30.30,00:23:30.30,- You ready?
520,00:23:31.30,00:23:31.30,- Firewood?
521,00:23:34.00,00:23:34.00,- There weresome discussions.
522,00:23:35.73,00:23:35.73,The younger group overheardsomehow.
523,00:23:37.73,00:23:37.73,We got sloppyand they began to panic.
524,00:23:40.57,00:23:40.57,"- It's just, you guys come backand you're all happy and chipper"
525,00:23:42.83,00:23:42.83,and you're connivingagainst us.
526,00:23:44.40,00:23:44.40,- Lindsey heard Frank say thatSilas was on board with us.
527,00:23:47.00,00:23:47.00,- You heard that?
528,00:23:48.57,00:23:48.57,"- I heard every word of it,I was standing right there."
529,00:23:50.47,00:23:50.47,"- Of course, me being direct andnot wanting to be dishonest,"
530,00:23:53.70,00:23:53.70,"all I could say was, yeah."
531,00:23:55.83,00:23:55.83,- She realizedsomething was going on
532,00:23:56.90,00:23:56.90,because she caught mehere.
533,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,- And Lindsey...
534,00:23:59.40,00:23:59.40,"- And she's with Silas now, soshe knows something's up."
535,00:24:02.03,00:24:02.03,"- She's all upset,you can see it."
536,00:24:03.47,00:24:03.47,- Listen to me.
537,00:24:04.93,00:24:04.93,You better notget me voted out here.
538,00:24:06.13,00:24:06.13,"- Look at me,come on, damn it."
539,00:24:07.83,00:24:07.83,- I don't know.
540,00:24:07.83,00:24:07.83,- Trust me.
541,00:24:09.40,00:24:09.40,We have got to be ableto knock people out.
542,00:24:11.33,00:24:11.33,I think Frankshould go first.
543,00:24:12.73,00:24:12.73,We're going to take itall the way.
544,00:24:14.97,00:24:14.97,"Trust me, get Kimand Brandon to trust you."
545,00:24:17.13,00:24:17.13,- Are you telling this toeveryone?
546,00:24:19.13,00:24:19.13,"No, I'm serious."
547,00:24:20.17,00:24:20.17,"- I have a lotriding on Silas,"
548,00:24:22.57,00:24:22.57,"and honestly,I have no other choice."
549,00:24:26.53,00:24:26.53,"- Trust me on this,all right?"
550,00:24:27.67,00:24:27.67,Do you trust me?
551,00:24:28.83,00:24:28.83,If you trust me.
552,00:24:30.07,00:24:30.07,"- Yeah, damn it, let's go,all right?"
553,00:24:32.07,00:24:32.07,- Who knows what Silas isreally up to?
554,00:24:34.07,00:24:34.07,"For all I know,Silas is over"
555,00:24:35.57,00:24:35.57,there with them and we're allgoing to get screwed.
556,00:24:37.73,00:24:37.73,"You know, you just have to rollwith the punches."
557,00:24:39.73,00:24:39.73,- I'll keepworking on Silas.
558,00:24:41.23,00:24:41.23,"- Silas is fine,he's no dummy."
559,00:24:43.50,00:24:43.50,- Silas is onour team all the way.
560,00:24:46.07,00:24:46.07,He'll play the otherpeople too
561,00:24:47.67,00:24:47.67,because he's going to go wherehe feels is the power.
562,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,But he's going to join us.
563,00:24:52.03,00:24:52.03,"Now, do I trust him?Hell, no."
564,00:24:54.03,00:24:54.03,- It's like this double face
565,00:24:55.80,00:24:55.80,thing you have to play whileyou're out here.
566,00:24:58.33,00:24:58.33,"It's funny, I mean, we're hereto win a million dollars."
567,00:25:01.07,00:25:01.07,"So, I'm going to dowhat it takes to win."
568,00:25:03.03,00:25:03.03,"I don't know,it's interesting."

820,00:36:11.13,00:36:11.13,"- Well, I'm just telling youface up, I voted against him"
821,00:36:14.00,00:36:14.00,the first timebecause I want him to know
822,00:36:16.60,00:36:16.60,it was a wake-upcall for him.
823,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,"- Tribal Councilis a huge drag for us,"
824,00:36:23.13,00:36:23.13,and we're goingtwice in a row.
825,00:36:25.03,00:36:25.03,"The first two Tribal CouncilsBoran is going both times,"
826,00:36:28.53,00:36:28.53,and none of us want to go.
827,00:37:03.27,00:37:03.27,"- (Probst) After having donethis once,"
828,00:37:05.53,00:37:05.53,I know you don't wantto be back here again tonight.
829,00:37:06.70,00:37:06.70,- No.
830,00:37:08.53,00:37:08.53,- Anybody want to own upthat this is tougher than
831,00:37:10.83,00:37:10.83,"they thought, those first fiveminutes out of the truck?"
832,00:37:13.27,00:37:13.27,"- Oh, my God, I never expectedanything to be this hard,"
833,00:37:17.13,00:37:17.13,especially the first couple dayswhen we didn't have water and we
834,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,couldn't do anything about foodand we had to eat
835,00:37:21.60,00:37:21.60,a lot of the canned food.
836,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,We weren't able to cookanything.
837,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,- Are you feeling better now?
838,00:37:24.77,00:37:24.77,"- Yeah,I'm feeling great."
839,00:37:26.13,00:37:26.13,"- (Probst) Lex, how big an issuesix days in is trust?"
840,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,- Trust is probably one ofthe biggest issues of all.
841,00:37:33.80,00:37:33.80,"I mean, we all came here, eightof us, didn't know anything"
842,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,"about each other, and yet wefound ourselves within the first"
843,00:37:41.83,00:37:41.83,day having to depend on eachother for just the most
844,00:37:43.83,00:37:43.83,basic survival needs.
845,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,"If you can't trust the peoplethat you're with,"
846,00:37:47.53,00:37:47.53,that's a problem.
847,00:37:49.13,00:37:49.13,"And given the fact that we havehad a couple of speed bumps,"
848,00:37:52.20,00:37:52.20,it's made itharder moving ahead.
849,00:37:54.03,00:37:54.03,"- (Probst) Tom, you were veryclear last time."
850,00:37:56.33,00:37:56.33,"You said, ""I forgive,but I don't forget."""
851,00:37:58.80,00:37:58.80,"- Just like a father figure,I told Clarence exactly what"
852,00:38:02.23,00:38:02.23,"I felt, and exactly whatI thought."
853,00:38:04.60,00:38:04.60,We've done nothingbut do better since then.
854,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,"I work closelywith Clarence,"
855,00:38:10.20,00:38:10.20,and I think he'sproven his self here.
856,00:38:13.53,00:38:13.53,"- (Probst) Clarence, got to askyou, sounds like you've redeemed"
857,00:38:16.53,00:38:16.53,yourself part of the way.
858,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,Are you still worried thoughthat could come up tonight?
859,00:38:20.80,00:38:20.80,"- I think you got to put it inperspective, in that we've only"
860,00:38:24.53,00:38:24.53,been here for six days and thatincident was freshly early.
861,00:38:27.97,00:38:27.97,All of ourissues with regard
862,00:38:30.37,00:38:30.37,"to me, I believe,are in the past."
863,00:38:31.97,00:38:31.97,- Let's talk aboutwho feels vulnerable.
864,00:38:33.80,00:38:33.80,"Kim, worried at all?"
865,00:38:34.83,00:38:34.83,"The reward challenge, a big"
866,00:38:36.53,00:38:36.53,reward and it was pretty clearyou were dragging it.
867,00:38:39.50,00:38:39.50,"- That splat did me in, um...yeah, absolutely."
868,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,"All things being equal in everyother area, you figure you go"
869,00:38:48.13,00:38:48.13,with the man at the timewho basically messed up.
870,00:38:51.77,00:38:51.77,"So, you know, absolutely,I'm scared and I'm vulnerable."
871,00:38:54.93,00:38:54.93,"- Kelly, last question,you're here tonight."
872,00:38:57.80,00:38:57.80,"- Because of me, I know!"
873,00:39:00.40,00:39:00.40,It's awful.
874,00:39:01.43,00:39:01.43,I feel terrible.
875,00:39:02.90,00:39:02.90,"It sucks too,because it wasn't"
876,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,something I was unpreparedto do.
877,00:39:06.43,00:39:06.43,It wasn't somethingI was incapable of.
878,00:39:08.03,00:39:08.03,"It's somethingI was excited for,"
879,00:39:09.40,00:39:09.40,"and I couldn't be morebummed, I feel awful."
880,00:39:11.77,00:39:11.77,It just sucksthat it fell that way.
881,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,"- (Probst) Okay,it's time to vote."
882,00:39:15.33,00:39:15.33,Jessie.
883,00:39:27.17,00:39:27.17,- Last time I wanted to votefor Clarence and I didn't get
884,00:39:29.87,00:39:29.87,"the chance, so I figure tonightI'm going to set my piece and"
885,00:39:32.53,00:39:32.53,vote for the person who I reallywanted to vote for last time.
886,00:39:48.67,00:39:48.67,"- I hate to lose her becauseshe's so nice, but she's having"
887,00:39:52.67,00:39:52.67,"trouble holding up in thesehorrible, hard conditions and if"
888,00:39:55.77,00:39:55.77,"she's still like that on dayfive or six, I don't think"
889,00:39:58.00,00:39:58.00,she's going to be ableto hold on for the long haul.
890,00:40:00.43,00:40:00.43,We need all the strengthwe can get.
891,00:40:25.67,00:40:25.67,"- I forgive,but I don't forget."
892,00:40:28.47,00:40:28.47,This is still anotherreminder.
893,00:40:37.50,00:40:37.50,- I'll gotally the votes.
894,00:40:57.20,00:40:57.20,"Once the votes have been read,the decision is final."
895,00:40:59.27,00:40:59.27,The person will be asked to
896,00:41:00.67,00:41:00.67,leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
897,00:41:02.57,00:41:02.57,I'll read the votes.
898,00:41:07.40,00:41:07.40,First vote.
899,00:41:09.83,00:41:09.83,Jess.
900,00:41:15.53,00:41:15.53,Clarence.
901,00:41:20.97,00:41:20.97,Jessie.
902,00:41:25.80,00:41:25.80,"C.B., Clarence."
903,00:41:27.43,00:41:27.43,"Two votes Jessie,two votes Clarence."
904,00:41:34.33,00:41:34.33,Jessie.
905,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,It's four votes Jessie.
906,00:41:45.97,00:41:45.97,No need to readthe last vote.
907,00:41:47.97,00:41:47.97,We'll leave that a mystery.
908,00:41:49.43,00:41:49.43,"You need to bring meyour torch, Jessie."
909,00:42:03.83,00:42:03.83,"Jessie, the tribe has spoken."
910,00:42:08.73,00:42:08.73,It's time for you to go.
911,00:42:17.43,00:42:17.43,"Never is easy, is it?"
912,00:42:19.10,00:42:19.10,"Well, it does seem likeyou guys have bonded."
913,00:42:21.80,00:42:21.80,"Obviously,the next few challenges--"
914,00:42:24.37,00:42:24.37,critical for theBoran Tribe.
915,00:42:26.33,00:42:26.33,Get to campand get some sleep.
916,00:42:28.03,00:42:28.03,I'll see you tomorrow.
917,00:42:51.37,00:42:51.37,- (Probst) Stay tuned for scenesfrom our next episode.
918,00:42:58.67,00:42:58.67,- (Probst) Next time on  Survivor:
919,00:43:00.33,00:43:00.33, Boran has someunwelcome visitors.
920,00:43:02.27,00:43:02.27,- Go away!
921,00:43:03.77,00:43:03.77,"- My mind said stay,but my feet said go."
922,00:43:06.67,00:43:06.67,- Lindsey pushes herselfbeyond her limit.
923,00:43:08.70,00:43:08.70,- I could take a broken boneover this.
924,00:43:11.53,00:43:11.53,- Lindsey likes tosay how strong she is.
925,00:43:14.13,00:43:14.13,Guess she's not so strong.
926,00:43:15.80,00:43:15.80,- And Boran strips down to thebare essentials.
927,00:43:24.43,00:43:24.43,- I know why the guys made thedecision they made.
928,00:43:26.47,00:43:26.47,"Obviously, they felt that they"
929,00:43:29.13,00:43:29.13,needed Clarence to stayin the challenge.
930,00:43:32.67,00:43:32.67,He's a little bit strongerthan me anyway.
931,00:43:35.90,00:43:35.90,"And that's the decision theymade, and I am okay with that."
932,00:43:40.30,00:43:40.30,And I just wanted to tell Tomthat I love him.
