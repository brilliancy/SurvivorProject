24,00:01:34.08,00:01:34.08,So I just had medical look at it and make sure everything is good
25,00:01:36.42,00:01:36.42,"and give me a little antibacterial, and I'll be all"

30,00:01:58.12,00:01:58.12,"this, okay? >> I work with my hands."
31,00:02:01.25,00:02:01.25,It's very important that I get this thing fixed as soon as
32,00:02:03.21,00:02:03.21,"possible, because I need my hands when I get back home."
33,00:02:06.08,00:02:06.08,>> That infection that's in your finger here has probably gone
34,00:02:08.46,00:02:08.46,"into the joint. If, in the morning, this doesn't"
35,00:02:11.12,00:02:11.12,"look good, then it needs to go to surgery."
36,00:02:23.21,00:02:23.21,"( theme song playing ) >> Okay, so, James, now,"

41,00:03:32.42,00:03:32.42,He got it looked at. And I guess the infection is
42,00:03:35.12,00:03:35.12,"really, really close to the joint, which can lead to"
43,00:03:38.04,00:03:38.04,"permanent problems. Oh, my God, James."
44,00:03:42.29,00:03:42.29,>> It's going to be all right. >> I hope his finger gets
45,00:03:45.71,00:03:45.71,"better, and I hope that they come tomorrow morning and say,"
46,00:03:48.12,00:03:48.12,"""Hey, you're fine,"" you know, like, ""you can finish the game."""

53,00:04:30.21,00:04:30.21,infected. I know this is bad because I am
54,00:04:33.04,00:04:33.04,"a nurse, but... that's two less people I have to fight against"
55,00:04:38.00,00:04:38.00,for a million dollars. >> This is just so sore.
56,00:04:41.62,00:04:41.62,">> It's puffy. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"

194,00:13:10.88,00:13:10.88,you. One more survivor.
195,00:13:14.04,00:13:14.04,Who's going? >> Nat.
196,00:13:16.08,00:13:16.08,">> PROBST: Natalie. Rocky, that means you are going"
197,00:13:20.17,00:13:20.17,to be going to Jellyfish Lake as well.
198,00:13:23.08,00:13:23.08,"All right, Alexis, you have one other big decision to make."
199,00:13:26.62,00:13:26.62,Who are you sending to Exile? >> Amanda.
200,00:13:31.42,00:13:31.42,">> PROBST: Amanda, get your stuff, head out."
201,00:13:33.25,00:13:33.25,Boat's waiting on you. >> Can I give my sister a hug
202,00:13:34.96,00:13:34.96,good-bye? >> PROBST: Nope.
203,00:13:36.29,00:13:36.29,I'm sorry. >> Love you.
204,00:13:38.88,00:13:38.88,"Bye, you guys. >> PROBST: All right, loved"
205,00:13:42.58,00:13:42.58,"ones, Gail, James, Curt, Katrina, time for you guys to"
206,00:13:45.54,00:13:45.54,go. Head back the way you came.
207,00:13:47.38,00:13:47.38,">> I'm doing good, dude. >> Bye, Dad."
208,00:13:49.29,00:13:49.29,>> I'm doing great. >> Bye.
209,00:13:53.33,00:13:53.33,">> PROBST: All right, James, Erik, Parvati, head back to"
210,00:13:55.25,00:13:55.25,"camp. James on your way out, I want"
211,00:13:57.25,00:13:57.25,medical to look at your finger. >> Yes.
212,00:13:59.96,00:13:59.96,">> PROBST: All right, enjoy. >> All right, thanks!"
213,00:14:01.92,00:14:01.92,>> PROBST: Have fun. Head out.
214,00:14:19.79,00:14:19.79,>> How is it faring? >> All right.
215,00:14:22.67,00:14:22.67,So hopefully it'll be cool. She might look at it now and be
216,00:14:25.12,00:14:25.12,"like, ""Hey, it's not that bad."" So hopefully she'll let me stay"
217,00:14:28.08,00:14:28.08,"and we'll be able to just keep things rolling, hopefully."
218,00:14:32.75,00:14:32.75,>> Have you got any pain going into your hand?
219,00:14:35.12,00:14:35.12,">> No, not at all. >> Any going into the rest of"
220,00:14:37.08,00:14:37.08,your finger? >> No.
221,00:14:39.92,00:14:39.92,It hurts on the sides. >> That's where it's sore?
222,00:14:43.04,00:14:43.04,">> Yes, ma'am. >> Okay."
223,00:14:46.38,00:14:46.38,The big risk with this is that it goes into that joint.
224,00:14:50.04,00:14:50.04,Bugs that get in there infect the joint really quickly.
225,00:14:53.00,00:14:53.00,It's not superficial. It's deep.
226,00:14:56.17,00:14:56.17,">> PROBST: So, Carolyn, catch me up."
227,00:14:57.67,00:14:57.67,What's the status? >> The risk of leaving him out
228,00:15:00.79,00:15:00.79,"here, obviously, is that the infection's going to set in."
229,00:15:04.79,00:15:04.79,It's a dirty environment. It's dangerous potentially for
230,00:15:08.17,00:15:08.17,"him-- for not just his finger, but his whole hand."
231,00:15:10.50,00:15:10.50,">> PROBST: So, James, you know the way the game works."
232,00:15:12.71,00:15:12.71,"It's always your call, unless medical decides it's too big a"
233,00:15:16.33,00:15:16.33,"risk. So, Carolyn, are you saying it"
234,00:15:19.50,00:15:19.50,is too big a risk? Are you pulling him from the
235,00:15:21.88,00:15:21.88,game? What's the call?
236,00:15:23.67,00:15:23.67,>> If he'd had absolutely no pain and it was just
237,00:15:25.67,00:15:25.67,"superficial, then I'd be happy. But my call is that it is too"
238,00:15:28.92,00:15:28.92,big a risk. It is.
239,00:15:35.08,00:15:35.08,">> PROBST: All right, let's get you out of here and get you to a"
240,00:15:37.17,00:15:37.17,hospital. >> Cool.
241,00:15:38.50,00:15:38.50,">> PROBST: Thanks, Carolyn. >> Thanks."
242,00:15:42.46,00:15:42.46,">> PROBST: Most of your tribe is on a reward, but those that are"
243,00:15:44.38,00:15:44.38,"here, you want to say good-bye? >> Yeah."
244,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,">> PROBST: All right. >> I mean, I'd much rather have"
245,00:15:48.29,00:15:48.29,"been voted out, but I'm definitely ready to go and get"
246,00:15:50.79,00:15:50.79,this thing fixed. Ain't no need playing with it.
247,00:15:52.38,00:15:52.38,Ain't no need to fraternize about it.
248,00:15:54.08,00:15:54.08,Just go and get it done. >> Get out.
249,00:15:58.54,00:15:58.54,>> Yeah. >> No.
250,00:15:59.75,00:15:59.75,>> You're leaving? >> Yeah.
251,00:16:01.54,00:16:01.54,>> James! >> No way!
252,00:16:04.62,00:16:04.62,">> James is, like, one of the toughest guys I've ever met in"
253,00:16:06.79,00:16:06.79,"my life, and I just have so much respect for James and who he is"
254,00:16:10.67,00:16:10.67,"as a person. It just... it's just not fair,"
255,00:16:13.42,00:16:13.42,you know? It's just not right for him to
256,00:16:15.25,00:16:15.25,go out like that. >> Good-bye.
257,00:16:18.29,00:16:18.29,"All right, man. >> Go drink some beers."
258,00:16:20.54,00:16:20.54,It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
259,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,>> It's going to be so lonely without him.
260,00:16:29.83,00:16:29.83,>> I know. I'm the only man left.
261,00:16:51.04,00:16:51.04,">> Alexis won the challenge, and we got to take our loved ones."
262,00:16:55.38,00:16:55.38,"Never in a million years did you ever think you'd do this, huh?"
263,00:16:58.42,00:16:58.42,And we got to hike up this little path and go swim with
264,00:17:02.58,00:17:02.58,stingless jellyfish. >> You see it?
265,00:17:09.46,00:17:09.46,>> It's right here. >> No wonder I felt something
266,00:17:11.83,00:17:11.83,"touching me. >> Ah, I see one."
267,00:17:13.54,00:17:13.54,"Look, it's in my hand. I see more."
268,00:17:38.12,00:17:38.12,>> It was so magnificent to see nature like that.
269,00:17:42.79,00:17:42.79,I think it might have been a breakthrough for me to swim with
270,00:17:47.04,00:17:47.04,"the jellyfish, because it kind of, like, opened my eyes a"
271,00:17:51.17,00:17:51.17,"little bit. Like, everything is not a"
272,00:17:53.38,00:17:53.38,threat. Maybe it's changed me a little
273,00:17:56.38,00:17:56.38,bit as to being afraid of every little thing.
274,00:18:00.08,00:18:00.08,">> Man, there's a million of them!"
275,00:18:02.12,00:18:02.12,>> They are everywhere. >> Golly!
276,00:18:05.21,00:18:05.21,>> Never before have I ever seen anything like this.
277,00:18:07.50,00:18:07.50,">> Incredible! >> Clue number one, ""Underneath"
278,00:18:18.00,00:18:18.00,"where the waves lap, you'll find another piece of the map."
279,00:18:22.21,00:18:22.21,"Closer than you think, you'll find the next link."""
280,00:18:26.21,00:18:26.21,"I just arrived at Exile, and now that I'm here, my only priority"
281,00:18:30.67,00:18:30.67,while I'm here is getting the idol.
282,00:18:40.29,00:18:40.29,"The waves lap right there. ""Now go back to the top and look"
283,00:18:47.75,00:18:47.75,out to sea. It's not in the mouth where you
284,00:18:50.54,00:18:50.54,"think it might be. But halfway there, you'll find"
285,00:18:53.62,00:18:53.62,"it submerged."" I just found the third clue."
286,00:19:18.08,00:19:18.08,It pretty much says I have to align the smallest island with
287,00:19:21.67,00:19:21.67,"the hut, and it makes a line. So I'm digging a line from the"
288,00:19:27.17,00:19:27.17,tower that's still in line with the island.
289,00:19:30.46,00:19:30.46,Hopefully I'm on the right track.
290,00:19:32.46,00:19:32.46,"If not, I'm going to be doing a lot of digging for no reason."
291,00:19:38.46,00:19:38.46,"Come on! Oh, my God!"
292,00:19:50.00,00:19:50.00,( laughing ) I thought I was going to be
293,00:19:54.83,00:19:54.83,"digging for the rest of my life. ""Hidden immunity idol is"
294,00:19:59.04,00:19:59.04,"buried""-- oh, my God-- ""back at your tribe's camp, underneath"
295,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,"your tribe's flag."" Oh, my God!"
296,00:20:22.67,00:20:22.67,">> Hey! Yeah, Erik's in the cave."
297,00:20:30.21,00:20:30.21,He got medically taken out. >> They took James?
298,00:20:33.71,00:20:33.71,">> Are you kidding me? >> Oh, my God, such a huge shock"
299,00:20:38.17,00:20:38.17,to come back from camp after that family members' reward and
300,00:20:41.38,00:20:41.38,"being, like, so high and hearing that James has been kicked out"
301,00:20:44.67,00:20:44.67,for medical reasons. It's very terrifying the idea
302,00:20:47.46,00:20:47.46,that I would be sent home because my knee is injured.
303,00:20:52.21,00:20:52.21,">> I started bawling, crying. I was, like, so emotional."
304,00:20:54.46,00:20:54.46,And it was just me and Erik. It's been me and Erik all day.
305,00:21:01.25,00:21:01.25,"And with James leaving the game, it kind of puts us in a weird"
306,00:21:06.12,00:21:06.12,"space, because we absolutely have to beat Erik at the next"
307,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,immunity challenge. If it comes down to him winning
308,00:21:15.25,00:21:15.25,"immunity, the women will definitely have to start eating"
309,00:21:18.29,00:21:18.29,each other. >> We're down to six people now?
310,00:21:20.62,00:21:20.62,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, it's us and Erik."
311,00:21:22.50,00:21:22.50,>> So we need to figure out what we need to do.
312,00:21:38.71,00:21:38.71,">> How you feeling this morning? >> It's bad, you know?"
313,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,>> Shaky? >> Yeah.
314,00:21:43.50,00:21:43.50,"Like, I have no stability in it. >> Right."
315,00:21:46.54,00:21:46.54,>> Do you really feel like you can do this for seven more days?
316,00:21:49.21,00:21:49.21,>> Yeah. >> You do?
317,00:21:50.46,00:21:50.46,>> Yeah. It's not even a question.
318,00:21:52.17,00:21:52.17,>> So you don't want us to vote you out?
319,00:21:56.21,00:21:56.21,>> It's not even an option. >> Because it just looks like
320,00:21:59.54,00:21:59.54,"you're in excruciating pain. >> But I can deal with that, you"
321,00:22:02.83,00:22:02.83,know? >> Okay.
322,00:22:05.38,00:22:05.38,">> This morning, Parvati said, ""Listen, girl, like, we can vote"
323,00:22:07.75,00:22:07.75,"you out and, you know, you can go home and, like, have medical"
324,00:22:10.96,00:22:10.96,"attention."" But, I mean, there's definitely"
325,00:22:13.04,00:22:13.04,"something that was a little threatening, so I hope that it's"
326,00:22:16.42,00:22:16.42,not a reflection of her mentality for the rest of the
327,00:22:19.17,00:22:19.17,"game. But then again, you never know."
328,00:22:21.25,00:22:21.25,"But what do y'all see? Like, what were y'all thinking?"
329,00:22:24.67,00:22:24.67,>> Erik goes next. I think it depends on who wins
330,00:22:27.08,00:22:27.08,"immunity and what happens. Like, what do y'all think?"
331,00:22:30.21,00:22:30.21,">> If I were to put myself in the final three, I couldn't win"
332,00:22:35.12,00:22:35.12,"against Amanda. Like, she's played a good social"
333,00:22:40.54,00:22:40.54,"game where everybody is on her side, and that's where the"
334,00:22:43.71,00:22:43.71,problem is. >> It's been pretty much me and
335,00:22:46.17,00:22:46.17,"her since day one, so I feel like I can't screw her over at"
336,00:22:49.21,00:22:49.21,this point. >> Right.
337,00:22:51.21,00:22:51.21,">> So if something were to happen, as far as her getting"
338,00:22:55.08,00:22:55.08,"voted, like, I can't have a part in it."
339,00:22:57.04,00:22:57.04,">> Yeah, you can't write her name down."
340,00:22:58.54,00:22:58.54,">> Like, I just won't. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
341,00:23:18.21,00:23:18.21,"We'll now bring in Amanda, returning from Exile Island."
342,00:23:20.75,00:23:20.75,>> Oh! >> Oh!
343,00:23:27.58,00:23:27.58,>> Where's James? >> He got medically taken out.
344,00:23:31.38,00:23:31.38,>> He got taken out after the challenge.
345,00:23:33.83,00:23:33.83,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Game continues."
346,00:23:37.12,00:23:37.12,"We are down to six, having three people leave this game due to"
347,00:23:42.33,00:23:42.33,reasons other than being voted out-- definitely a Survivor
348,00:23:45.54,00:23:45.54,"first. All right, you guys ready to get"
349,00:23:48.71,00:23:48.71,to today's challenge? >> Yeah.
350,00:23:50.62,00:23:50.62,">> PROBST: First things first. Erik, I'll take back the"
351,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,necklace. >> Here you go.
352,00:23:58.00,00:23:58.00,">> PROBST: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
353,00:24:02.67,00:24:02.67,"For today's challenge, you're each going to take turns firing"
354,00:24:05.04,00:24:05.04,"a high-powered rifle, attempting to break colored sake bottles."
355,00:24:13.33,00:24:13.33,The first person to break all three of their sake bottles wins
356,00:24:17.88,00:24:17.88,"immunity, is guaranteed a one- in-five shot at winning this"
357,00:24:22.12,00:24:22.12,"game. All right, we'll draw for order,"
358,00:24:25.83,00:24:25.83,and we'll get started. Here we go.
359,00:24:30.79,00:24:30.79,"First round, Natalie, you're up. >> Let's go, Nat."
360,00:24:33.46,00:24:33.46,">> Go, mama. >> PROBST: You are aiming for"
361,00:24:35.71,00:24:35.71,one of your three colored sake bottles.
362,00:24:40.12,00:24:40.12,Looking for a purple sake bottle.
363,00:24:43.25,00:24:43.25,"Get on the board early. Natalie connects, breaks her"
364,00:24:53.12,00:24:53.12,first bottle. Natalie on the board with one.
365,00:24:56.54,00:24:56.54,>> Nice shot! >> PROBST: Good first shot.
366,00:24:58.71,00:24:58.71,Amanda. Amanda looking to hit a light-
367,00:25:04.46,00:25:04.46,blue bottle. Misses to the right.
368,00:25:14.17,00:25:14.17,Parvati. Parvati looking to nail that
369,00:25:19.54,00:25:19.54,middle yellow bottle. Parvati connects!
370,00:25:28.33,00:25:28.33,Parvati on the board with her first bottle.
371,00:25:30.58,00:25:30.58,>> Nice! >> PROBST: Natalie and Parvati
372,00:25:32.17,00:25:32.17,both with one. Cirie looking to hit a white
373,00:25:36.21,00:25:36.21,sake bottle with her name on it. >> Damn.
374,00:25:44.58,00:25:44.58,>> PROBST: Cirie misses high and wide to the right.
375,00:25:48.17,00:25:48.17,Erik looking for a red sake bottle.
376,00:25:50.88,00:25:50.88,Got three to choose from. Erik with his first bottle.
377,00:26:00.00,00:26:00.00,">> Good job, Erik. >> PROBST: Alexis is up."
378,00:26:04.33,00:26:04.33,Alexis looking for green. Just misses.

380,00:26:15.25,00:26:15.25,"have one bottle. Natalie, you're up."
381,00:26:19.38,00:26:19.38,Natalie could go back out in the lead with this shot.
382,00:26:23.88,00:26:23.88,">> Get them, mama. >> Oh!"
383,00:26:34.08,00:26:34.08,">> Off the back. >> Ricocheted, ricocheted."
384,00:26:40.83,00:26:40.83,>> PROBST: Amanda looking for a light-blue target.
385,00:26:44.21,00:26:44.21,>> Crap! >> PROBST: Almost hits Alexis's
386,00:26:46.21,00:26:46.21,bottle. >> Whoa.
387,00:26:49.00,00:26:49.00,">> PROBST: Parvati just misses. >> Oh, my God."
388,00:26:53.08,00:26:53.08,>> Nicked the name tag. >> PROBST: Erik connects again!
389,00:26:59.79,00:26:59.79,Erik with his second bottle. >> Wow.
390,00:27:03.12,00:27:03.12,>> PROBST: Erik now in the lead. >> Wow.
391,00:27:06.75,00:27:06.75,">> PROBST: Alexis, no luck. Erik in the lead with two."
392,00:27:11.04,00:27:11.04,Natalie and Parvati both with one.
393,00:27:13.17,00:27:13.17,"Natalie, you're up. Natalie needs another hit to tie"
394,00:27:16.04,00:27:16.04,with Erik. >> Nice.
395,00:27:29.42,00:27:29.42,>> Nice. ( applause )
396,00:27:31.12,00:27:31.12,">> PROBST: Natalie connects, hitting her second bottle."
397,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,Natalie and Erik each have two bottles.
398,00:27:42.00,00:27:42.00,Amanda connects. Amanda on the board with her
399,00:27:43.71,00:27:43.71,first bottle. >> Yeah!
400,00:27:47.25,00:27:47.25,>> PROBST: Parvati misses again. Just misses.
401,00:27:53.04,00:27:53.04,>> Close. >> PROBST: Here's where we
402,00:27:54.92,00:27:54.92,stand. Natalie has two.
403,00:27:56.33,00:27:56.33,Erik has two. Erik has not yet taken his shot
404,00:27:58.12,00:27:58.12,"in this round. Erik, you're up."
405,00:28:00.17,00:28:00.17,"If you hit your third bottle, you win immunity."
406,00:28:09.54,00:28:09.54,Erik can close it out here. Takes his aim.
407,00:28:27.29,00:28:27.29,Erik does it. Erik wins immunity!
408,00:28:31.75,00:28:31.75,">> Wow. Good job, Erik."
409,00:28:34.12,00:28:34.12,">> Good job, Erik. ( applause )"
410,00:28:36.79,00:28:36.79,">> PROBST: Erik, once again immunity is yours."
411,00:28:41.04,00:28:41.04,Erik is safe at tonight's vote. One of you five women going home
412,00:28:45.33,00:28:45.33,tonight. You have the afternoon to figure
413,00:28:47.46,00:28:47.46,out who it's going to be. Head back to camp.
414,00:28:49.17,00:28:49.17,"See you at tribal. >> Okay, first of all, I want"
415,00:29:09.79,00:29:09.79,"you guys to know that I don't have it, so I'm going to empty"
416,00:29:12.71,00:29:12.71,my bag. >> How many clues did you get?
417,00:29:17.12,00:29:17.12,>> Because I don't have it. I could not find the third clue
418,00:29:19.46,00:29:19.46,for the life of me. I couldn't find it.
419,00:29:22.12,00:29:22.12,"It was submerged under the water, and the current was so"
420,00:29:23.96,00:29:23.96,strong I couldn't... I couldn't find it.
421,00:29:26.58,00:29:26.58,">> So the clue was in the water? >> Yeah, it was underwater."
422,00:29:29.54,00:29:29.54,">> That's frustrating. I'm sorry, girl."
423,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,">> That's all right. But I wanted to find it, you"
424,00:29:35.08,00:29:35.08,know? >> That's okay.
425,00:29:40.50,00:29:40.50,"It's cursed anyway. >> Yeah, that's legit, man."
426,00:29:42.79,00:29:42.79,">> It was harder than I thought, obviously."
427,00:29:47.21,00:29:47.21,>> The chicken? >> He's biting the dust.
428,00:29:50.08,00:29:50.08,You want to say bye? >> Time to go.
429,00:29:51.67,00:29:51.67,>> Should I kill it now? Do you guys want to kill it now?
430,00:29:53.67,00:29:53.67,>> I kind of want to do it. >> You want to do it?
431,00:29:55.17,00:29:55.17,">> Killing chicken! >> Oh, slick."
432,00:30:17.12,00:30:17.12,Okay. >> What do you think is the best
433,00:30:20.25,00:30:20.25,move for us. >> I think Alexis.
434,00:30:23.12,00:30:23.12,>> I think Natalie. >> I really think Alexis.
435,00:30:30.21,00:30:30.21,>> I think Alexis is our biggest threat as far as jury votes in
436,00:30:33.12,00:30:33.12,"the end, and I'm looking towards the end of this game right now."
437,00:30:37.00,00:30:37.00,"I see where Amanda is coming from, on the other hand, as far"
438,00:30:39.21,00:30:39.21,as Natalie being the bigger threat in challenges.
439,00:30:41.46,00:30:41.46,So it's kind of a toss-up right now.
440,00:30:43.79,00:30:43.79,And I think that you could get...
441,00:30:45.83,00:30:45.83,They want to. >> They do?
442,00:30:47.62,00:30:47.62,>> They've been talking about it while you're gone.
443,00:30:53.21,00:30:53.21,">> You really don't think that you could, like, hold it over"
444,00:30:55.17,00:30:55.17,his head that you kept him here longer than Ami?
445,00:30:57.08,00:30:57.08,">> That's what I was thinking. >> Find that damn idol, lady."
446,00:31:06.17,00:31:06.17,>> I think Amanda would do really well in the final three--
447,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,"really well. >> Amanda is, hands down, the"
448,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,biggest jury threat. And so it's like... it's not
449,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,even fun to battle it out to get to the final three to just...
450,00:31:17.42,00:31:17.42,>> Lose to her. >> ...lose to her.
451,00:31:19.46,00:31:19.46,And if we have an opportunity to take her out now...
452,00:31:22.00,00:31:22.00,>> Luckily she doesn't have the idol.
453,00:31:23.46,00:31:23.46,>> Yeah. >> So that's the good thing.
454,00:31:42.38,00:31:42.38,">> At this point, I know I'm between you and Parv."
455,00:31:46.92,00:31:46.92,That's where I'm at. >> To vote for me or Parv?
456,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,>> Yeah. I feel like you guys are big
457,00:31:51.17,00:31:51.17,threats. You know?
458,00:31:57.79,00:31:57.79,"And, like, when you needed my help, I helped you out."
459,00:32:01.04,00:32:01.04,>> I feel like you could beat me in a challenge coming up.
460,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,"I honestly do. >> But I helped you out, and I"
461,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,knew that you were a threat. >> Okay.
462,00:32:36.50,00:32:36.50,>> Here we go. Do you know how to carve up a
463,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,chicken? >> Yeah.
464,00:32:40.08,00:32:40.08,>> You on board? >> I was going to ask you.
465,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,So what's the deal? >> That's the deal.
466,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,">> Okay. >> And it makes sense, I think."
467,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,">> Okay. Yeah, I'm on board."
468,00:32:53.21,00:32:53.21,>> Okay. >> I'm going to be so sorry to
469,00:32:56.96,00:32:56.96,"see Amanda go. But strategically, it's not such"
470,00:33:00.08,00:33:00.08,"a bad thing, because I don't think Parvati or myself could"
471,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,beat her with jury votes. So it saddens me that it's going
472,00:33:09.75,00:33:09.75,"to be Amanda, but it's the game, you know?"
473,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,"The game must go on. I want Alexis to go, but Erik is"
474,00:33:16.21,00:33:16.21,"not... If I make it even, Amanda, then"
475,00:33:22.04,00:33:22.04,we're going to have to vote again.
476,00:33:23.92,00:33:23.92,"If nobody changes their vote, then all of us pick a rock, and"
477,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,"whoever gets the colored rock, goes home."
478,00:33:30.25,00:33:30.25,"That's how it is at this point. At the four, then you do a"
479,00:33:32.54,00:33:32.54,"challenge. I'm, like, in between a rock and"
480,00:33:37.33,00:33:37.33,a hard place. What do I do?
481,00:33:39.21,00:33:39.21,Make it even and then pick the rock.
482,00:33:40.92,00:33:40.92,You see my luck. I couldn't even hit a damn
483,00:33:42.58,00:33:42.58,"bottle. Yeah, yeah."
484,00:33:49.62,00:33:49.62,"And it's Erik. No, you know I didn't want it"
485,00:33:51.54,00:33:51.54,"like this. Because now, to me..."
486,00:33:58.88,00:33:58.88,"You know that I would. So what do I do, make it a tie?"
487,00:34:16.33,00:34:16.33,">> Tender. >> Well, what happened to"
488,00:34:27.08,00:34:27.08,"Amanda? >> No, she's coming."
489,00:34:28.75,00:34:28.75,She just wanted to wash her armpits because I told her she
490,00:34:30.38,00:34:30.38,"stunk. >> You know, the consensus is me"
491,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,tonight. So I'm going to have to see if I
492,00:34:40.62,00:34:40.62,can get the hidden immunity idol.
493,00:34:42.42,00:34:42.42,"And if not, I'm gone. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
494,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,"the members of the jury, Eliza, Ozzy, and Jason, voted out at"
495,00:35:08.04,00:35:08.04,the last tribal council. We have one more jury member
496,00:35:14.42,00:35:14.42,slowly making their way to tribal council.
497,00:35:22.12,00:35:22.12,James making his first appearance since being pulled
498,00:35:24.38,00:35:24.38,from the game by our medical team.
499,00:35:37.33,00:35:37.33,"All right, jury, first, let me catch you up."
500,00:35:39.71,00:35:39.71,James was pulled from the game for a medical injury.
501,00:35:42.71,00:35:42.71,He didn't want to go. He didn't have a say in it.
502,00:35:44.88,00:35:44.88,Now let's get to the IV bag. >> I had an infection they had
503,00:35:48.79,00:35:48.79,to take care of. So that's very bad.
504,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"You could lose your hand. I need my hands to work with, so"
505,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,it wasn't a chance I was able to take.
506,00:35:56.25,00:35:56.25,"But I'm here now. As long as I have the IV, I'm"
507,00:35:58.04,00:35:58.04,good. >> PROBST: It's certainly a
508,00:35:59.79,00:35:59.79,first. Glad you're here.
509,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,">> Thanks. >> PROBST: Okay, Amanda, let's"
510,00:36:04.04,00:36:04.04,talk about Exile Island. Did you spend any time looking
511,00:36:06.75,00:36:06.75,"for the hidden immunity idol? >> It was really windy, and the"
512,00:36:10.58,00:36:10.58,"currents were really strong, so I couldn't find it."
513,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,It's frustrating when you're looking for something to save
514,00:36:17.75,00:36:17.75,"your life in this game, and I just didn't do it,"
515,00:36:20.42,00:36:20.42,unfortunately. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
516,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,threats at this point in the game.
517,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,There's the physical threat. Then there's the likability
518,00:36:26.29,00:36:26.29,"threat. Cirie, who are the physical"
519,00:36:28.83,00:36:28.83,threats at this point in the game?
520,00:36:31.12,00:36:31.12,"Erik and Amanda, pretty much. >> PROBST: You can't vote for"
521,00:36:35.12,00:36:35.12,"Erik tonight. Fingers point to you, Amanda."
522,00:36:37.83,00:36:37.83,">> Yeah, pretty much everyone here has told me that they're"
523,00:36:39.71,00:36:39.71,voting for me tonight. The only person that's voting
524,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,with me tonight is Parvati. >> Amanda has become like my
525,00:36:45.71,00:36:45.71,"little sister in this game. I can't vote for her, and I"
526,00:36:48.08,00:36:48.08,won't. >> I feel like it's been kind of
527,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,"me and Erik too. You know, like, we've gone"
528,00:36:53.92,00:36:53.92,"through a lot of this together. And when he needs someone, he"
529,00:36:56.88,00:36:56.88,comes across trustworthy. But then when you need Erik for
530,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,"something, he finds greener grasses somewhere else."
531,00:37:03.71,00:37:03.71,"That's pretty much how it is. >> Amanda, directly, I think, is"
532,00:37:06.58,00:37:06.58,blaming me for the fact that I have to make a decision between
533,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,"who's staying, who's going. >> But you have to understand."
534,00:37:12.88,00:37:12.88,"Like, I helped you stay here through the merge, and then I"
535,00:37:15.25,00:37:15.25,"was asking for your help this time, and you clearly denied me"
536,00:37:18.38,00:37:18.38,"of that. And yeah, I'm mad about it."
537,00:37:21.79,00:37:21.79,"I'm pretty pissed off right now. >> PROBST: Natalie, at this"
538,00:37:26.21,00:37:26.21,"point in the game, who concerns you the most in terms of ""Can't"
539,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,"let them get to the end; they will win""?"
540,00:37:32.00,00:37:32.00,>> Amanda. She has done no wrong to anyone
541,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,"sitting over there on the jury, and voting her out is the"
542,00:37:39.25,00:37:39.25,unfortunate part of getting down to this part of the game.
543,00:37:42.71,00:37:42.71,But I feel the need to at least be honest with my reasoning
544,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,"behind my vote. >> To reiterate what Nat said,"
545,00:37:49.29,00:37:49.29,"you know, like, we adore her, and so, like, we're going to"
546,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,tell her because we respect her so much.
547,00:37:55.38,00:37:55.38,"I would grant that to any of these people, because I truly"
548,00:37:57.88,00:37:57.88,respect every person here right now.
549,00:38:01.92,00:38:01.92,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to the vote."
550,00:38:05.75,00:38:05.75,"Erik, you have the individual immunity necklace."
551,00:38:07.92,00:38:07.92,"As always, you can give it to somebody else if you want."
552,00:38:09.88,00:38:09.88,>> I'm going to keep it. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for
553,00:38:11.58,00:38:11.58,Erik. Everybody else is fair game.
554,00:38:13.25,00:38:13.25,"It is time to vote. Cirie, you're up."
555,00:38:28.29,00:38:28.29,">> This is only because if I did not make this vote, I would be"
556,00:38:32.12,00:38:32.12,"handing you a million dollars. >> Amanda, I absolutely adore"
557,00:38:51.33,00:38:51.33,you. This is one of the hardest votes
558,00:38:53.25,00:38:53.25,I'll put in. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
559,00:39:07.71,00:39:07.71,"votes. >> It's okay, baby."
560,00:39:21.42,00:39:21.42,>> PROBST: If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you
561,00:39:23.83,00:39:23.83,"want to play it, now would be the time to do so."
562,00:39:32.08,00:39:32.08,">> About that, Jeff... I just want to say when I told"
