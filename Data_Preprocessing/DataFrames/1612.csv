270,00:17:51.17,00:17:51.17,"little bit.Like, everything is not a"
271,00:17:53.38,00:17:53.38,threat.Maybe it's changed me a little

285,00:19:18.08,00:19:18.08,It pretty much says I have toalign the smallest island with

287,00:19:27.17,00:19:27.17,tower that's still in line withthe island.
288,00:19:30.46,00:19:30.46,Hopefully I'm on the righttrack.
289,00:19:32.46,00:19:32.46,"If not, I'm going to be doing alot of digging for no reason."

300,00:20:44.67,00:20:44.67,for medical reasons.It's very terrifying the idea
301,00:20:47.46,00:20:47.46,that I would be sent homebecause my knee is injured.
302,00:20:52.21,00:20:52.21,">> I started bawling, crying.I was, like, so emotional."

304,00:21:01.25,00:21:01.25,"And with James leaving the game,it kind of puts us in a weird"
305,00:21:06.12,00:21:06.12,"space, because we absolutelyhave to beat Erik at the next"

307,00:21:15.25,00:21:15.25,"immunity, the women willdefinitely have to start eating"

434,00:30:30.21,00:30:30.21,>> I think Alexis is our biggestthreat as far as jury votes in
435,00:30:33.12,00:30:33.12,"the end, and I'm looking towardsthe end of this game right now."
436,00:30:37.00,00:30:37.00,"I see where Amanda is comingfrom, on the other hand, as far"
437,00:30:39.21,00:30:39.21,as Natalie being the biggerthreat in challenges.
438,00:30:41.46,00:30:41.46,So it's kind of a toss-up rightnow.
439,00:30:43.79,00:30:43.79,And I think that you couldget...
440,00:30:45.83,00:30:45.83,They want to.>> They do?
441,00:30:47.62,00:30:47.62,>> They've been talking about itwhile you're gone.
442,00:30:53.21,00:30:53.21,">> You really don't think thatyou could, like, hold it over"

445,00:31:06.17,00:31:06.17,>> I think Amanda would doreally well in the final three--
446,00:31:09.08,00:31:09.08,"really well.>> Amanda is, hands down, the"
447,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,biggest jury threat.And so it's like... it's not
448,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,even fun to battle it out to getto the final three to just...
449,00:31:17.42,00:31:17.42,>> Lose to her.>> ...lose to her.
450,00:31:19.46,00:31:19.46,And if we have an opportunity totake her out now...
451,00:31:22.00,00:31:22.00,>> Luckily she doesn't have theidol.
452,00:31:23.46,00:31:23.46,>> Yeah.>> So that's the good thing.
453,00:31:42.38,00:31:42.38,">> At this point, I know I'mbetween you and Parv."
454,00:31:46.92,00:31:46.92,That's where I'm at.>> To vote for me or Parv?
455,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,>> Yeah.I feel like you guys are big
456,00:31:51.17,00:31:51.17,threats.You know?
457,00:31:57.79,00:31:57.79,"And, like, when you needed myhelp, I helped you out."
458,00:32:01.04,00:32:01.04,>> I feel like you could beat mein a challenge coming up.
459,00:32:03.88,00:32:03.88,"I honestly do.>> But I helped you out, and I"
460,00:32:06.17,00:32:06.17,knew that you were a threat.>> Okay.
461,00:32:36.50,00:32:36.50,>> Here we go.Do you know how to carve up a
462,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,chicken?>> Yeah.
463,00:32:40.08,00:32:40.08,>> You on board?>> I was going to ask you.
464,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,So what's the deal?>> That's the deal.
465,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,">> Okay.>> And it makes sense, I think."
466,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,">> Okay.Yeah, I'm on board."
467,00:32:53.21,00:32:53.21,>> Okay.>> I'm going to be so sorry to
468,00:32:56.96,00:32:56.96,"see Amanda go.But strategically, it's not such"
469,00:33:00.08,00:33:00.08,"a bad thing, because I don'tthink Parvati or myself could"
470,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,beat her with jury votes.So it saddens me that it's going
471,00:33:09.75,00:33:09.75,"to be Amanda, but it's the game,you know?"
472,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,"The game must go on.I want Alexis to go, but Erik is"
473,00:33:16.21,00:33:16.21,"not...If I make it even, Amanda, then"
474,00:33:22.04,00:33:22.04,we're going to have to voteagain.
475,00:33:23.92,00:33:23.92,"If nobody changes their vote,then all of us pick a rock, and"
476,00:33:27.21,00:33:27.21,"whoever gets the colored rock,goes home."
477,00:33:30.25,00:33:30.25,"That's how it is at this point.At the four, then you do a"
478,00:33:32.54,00:33:32.54,"challenge.I'm, like, in between a rock and"
479,00:33:37.33,00:33:37.33,a hard place.What do I do?
480,00:33:39.21,00:33:39.21,Make it even and then pick therock.
481,00:33:40.92,00:33:40.92,You see my luck.I couldn't even hit a damn
482,00:33:42.58,00:33:42.58,"bottle.Yeah, yeah."
483,00:33:49.62,00:33:49.62,"And it's Erik.No, you know I didn't want it"
484,00:33:51.54,00:33:51.54,"like this.Because now, to me..."
485,00:33:58.88,00:33:58.88,"You know that I would.So what do I do, make it a tie?"
486,00:34:16.33,00:34:16.33,">> Tender.>> Well, what happened to"
487,00:34:27.08,00:34:27.08,"Amanda?>> No, she's coming."
488,00:34:28.75,00:34:28.75,She just wanted to wash herarmpits because I told her she
489,00:34:30.38,00:34:30.38,"stunk.>> You know, the consensus is me"
490,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,tonight.So I'm going to have to see if I
491,00:34:40.62,00:34:40.62,can get the hidden immunityidol.
492,00:34:42.42,00:34:42.42,"And if not, I'm gone.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
493,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,"the members of the jury, Eliza,Ozzy, and Jason, voted out at"
494,00:35:08.04,00:35:08.04,the last tribal council.We have one more jury member
495,00:35:14.42,00:35:14.42,slowly making their way totribal council.
496,00:35:22.12,00:35:22.12,James making his firstappearance since being pulled
497,00:35:24.38,00:35:24.38,from the game by our medicalteam.
498,00:35:37.33,00:35:37.33,"All right, jury, first, let mecatch you up."
499,00:35:39.71,00:35:39.71,James was pulled from the gamefor a medical injury.
500,00:35:42.71,00:35:42.71,He didn't want to go.He didn't have a say in it.
501,00:35:44.88,00:35:44.88,Now let's get to the IV bag.>> I had an infection they had
502,00:35:48.79,00:35:48.79,to take care of.So that's very bad.
503,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,"You could lose your hand.I need my hands to work with, so"
504,00:35:53.79,00:35:53.79,it wasn't a chance I was able totake.
505,00:35:56.25,00:35:56.25,"But I'm here now.As long as I have the IV, I'm"
506,00:35:58.04,00:35:58.04,good.>> PROBST: It's certainly a

511,00:36:10.58,00:36:10.58,"currents were really strong, soI couldn't find it."
512,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,It's frustrating when you'relooking for something to save
513,00:36:17.75,00:36:17.75,"your life in this game, and Ijust didn't do it,"
514,00:36:20.42,00:36:20.42,unfortunately.>> PROBST: Let's talk about
515,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,threats at this point in thegame.
516,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,There's the physical threat.Then there's the likability

523,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,with me tonight is Parvati.>> Amanda has become like my
524,00:36:45.71,00:36:45.71,"little sister in this game.I can't vote for her, and I"
525,00:36:48.08,00:36:48.08,won't.>> I feel like it's been kind of

527,00:36:53.92,00:36:53.92,"through a lot of this together.And when he needs someone, he"
528,00:36:56.88,00:36:56.88,comes across trustworthy.But then when you need Erik for
529,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,"something, he finds greenergrasses somewhere else."
530,00:37:03.71,00:37:03.71,"That's pretty much how it is.>> Amanda, directly, I think, is"
531,00:37:06.58,00:37:06.58,blaming me for the fact that Ihave to make a decision between
532,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,"who's staying, who's going.>> But you have to understand."
533,00:37:12.88,00:37:12.88,"Like, I helped you stay herethrough the merge, and then I"
534,00:37:15.25,00:37:15.25,"was asking for your help thistime, and you clearly denied me"
535,00:37:18.38,00:37:18.38,"of that.And yeah, I'm mad about it."

542,00:37:42.71,00:37:42.71,But I feel the need to at leastbe honest with my reasoning
543,00:37:45.21,00:37:45.21,"behind my vote.>> To reiterate what Nat said,"
544,00:37:49.29,00:37:49.29,"you know, like, we adore her,and so, like, we're going to"
