560,00:35:24.47,00:35:24.47,deal with in the final fewtribal councils is whether I
561,00:35:28.27,00:35:28.27,want to sit beside someone whoalmost guarantees me the million
562,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,"bucks or whether I want to sitbeside someone who, if I don't"
563,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,"win the million bucks, I'llstill feel good about that other"

573,00:36:43.23,00:36:43.23,one idea of who you're going tovote out tonight.
574,00:36:45.73,00:36:45.73,"By the time you get here, it'scompletely different."
575,00:36:48.07,00:36:48.07,"Is that plausible, possible?>> KEITH: You know, you play a"
576,00:36:51.43,00:36:51.43,"lot of mind games with yourself.I mean, you are your own worst"
577,00:36:54.83,00:36:54.83,player at this stage of the gamebecause you're constantly

581,00:37:08.60,00:37:08.60,because... it's where it isright now.
582,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,>> JEFF: Is there a sense ofparanoia that takes over?
583,00:37:14.73,00:37:14.73,"You see two people huddled inthe corner, you think, ""I know"

589,00:37:28.60,00:37:28.60,"And then you see some peoplewhispering and you're like, ""Oh,"

596,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"Elisabeth, tell me about therelationship with Rodger,"
597,00:37:52.40,00:37:52.40,because you guys seem to havereally connected.

600,00:38:04.93,00:38:04.93,knew that there was somethingspecial.
601,00:38:08.23,00:38:08.23,"We've become friends.I feel safe with Rodger around,"
602,00:38:13.13,00:38:13.13,and Rodger's my man.I love him.

605,00:38:22.23,00:38:22.23,flattered.But I could very easily turn the
606,00:38:24.03,00:38:24.03,tables back on Elisabeth.She's a fine young lady.
607,00:38:30.33,00:38:30.33,"Character-wise, morals-wise andshe's tops in my book."

615,00:38:56.30,00:38:56.30,"my faux pas, and that's just theway it goes, part of the game."
616,00:39:00.20,00:39:00.20,What are you going to do?Can't cry over spilled milk.
617,00:39:03.80,00:39:03.80,">> JEFF: All right, guys.11 torches behind me, five left."
