285,00:19:38.23,00:19:38.23,two weeks old. God's giving us a present this

287,00:19:49.73,00:19:49.73,That was a huge find for us. It was the basis behind a great

289,00:19:55.93,00:19:55.93,I literally cannot believe that. >> KEITH: You can see how a
290,00:19:59.20,00:19:59.20,"caveman learned about fire and captured it, picked it up,"
291,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53,brought it back to where he was at.
292,00:20:04.80,00:20:04.80,>> RODGER: And that's how they started having weenie roasts.

296,00:20:32.10,00:20:32.10,"From a material standpoint, we've lost a lot."
297,00:20:35.53,00:20:35.53,"I mean, we have our rice, and now that we know we have food,"
298,00:20:39.23,00:20:39.23,we rationed the rice for the amount of days that we have
299,00:20:41.93,00:20:41.93,left. >> ELISABETH: How much do we
300,00:20:44.37,00:20:44.37,have left? >> RODGER: Two bags of brown
301,00:20:46.40,00:20:46.40,rice and a bag of white rice. >> COLBY: Keith is cooking way
302,00:20:50.57,00:20:50.57,too much rice at every meal. All you've got to do is just
303,00:20:53.53,00:20:53.53,make smaller servings and he just... he can't get it through
304,00:20:55.73,00:20:55.73,his head. >> KEITH: This is where the game
305,00:21:01.23,00:21:01.23,is really on right now. My intention is that I'll be
306,00:21:04.50,00:21:04.50,here with Colby and Tina in the last three.

312,00:21:28.37,00:21:28.37,other members of the group see as a value.
313,00:21:32.00,00:21:32.00,Let me try something on this-- a little experiment here.
314,00:21:35.90,00:21:35.90,">> ELISABETH: Keith just said, ""I'm going to do a little"
315,00:21:37.50,00:21:37.50,"experiment with the brown rice and white rice."""
316,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,"I mean, our portions were huge. And he said, ""You know, I'm used"
317,00:21:42.07,00:21:42.07,to doing this sort of thing. I can I assess how much we
318,00:21:43.47,00:21:43.47,"have."" I think he just feels awfully"
319,00:21:46.40,00:21:46.40,comfortable with the fact that he's going to be one of the
320,00:21:49.23,00:21:49.23,"final three or two, and he knows the portion sizes will be bigger"
321,00:21:51.87,00:21:51.87,then. >> COLBY: Isn't that rice
322,00:21:54.73,00:21:54.73,cooked? >> KEITH: Just cooked a little
323,00:21:56.80,00:21:56.80,"bit of it. It's okay, I blended it in with"
324,00:21:59.13,00:21:59.13,the white. The brown rice cooks up and
325,00:22:01.50,00:22:01.50,expands so much more; gives you more volume.
326,00:22:04.87,00:22:04.87,">> COLBY: Keith, you said the exact opposite five days ago."
327,00:22:07.10,00:22:07.10,You said the brown rice yields less.
328,00:22:08.30,00:22:08.30,">> KEITH: No, I said you have to use more water."
329,00:22:10.27,00:22:10.27,">> COLBY: No, you said it yields less."
330,00:22:11.77,00:22:11.77,You said it three times in a row.
331,00:22:12.97,00:22:12.97,">> KEITH: I said, if you don't use more water."
332,00:22:14.87,00:22:14.87,>> COLBY: Put half a cup ration. We decided on that and we have
333,00:22:17.27,00:22:17.27,not stuck to it in the last four meals.
334,00:22:18.87,00:22:18.87,>> KEITH: Colby... >> COLBY: I'm not going to do
335,00:22:21.33,00:22:21.33,"this ration thing again, where we run out of rice, Keith."
336,00:22:23.03,00:22:23.03,>> KEITH: We're fine. >> COLBY: We were... we're
337,00:22:24.37,00:22:24.37,"eating fine. >> KEITH: Okay, we will be"
338,00:22:25.33,00:22:25.33,"fine. I'll check it again, but I'm"
339,00:22:27.60,00:22:27.60,sure we're more than fine. >> ELISABETH: Check it right
340,00:22:30.27,00:22:30.27,"after we eat. >> KEITH: Yeah, I actually"
341,00:22:32.83,00:22:32.83,"checked it before we ate, actually."
342,00:22:34.30,00:22:34.30,The rice issue today was the first time I've seen Colby blow
343,00:22:36.77,00:22:36.77,"up-- and it got me legitimately concerned, especially when"
344,00:22:40.93,00:22:40.93,"Elisabeth was right there, chiming in."
345,00:22:43.10,00:22:43.10,I thought there's something going on here and I'm really in
346,00:22:45.93,00:22:45.93,a very vulnerable situation. >> COLBY: We had 14 days worth
347,00:22:48.60,00:22:48.60,"of rice with 12 days left, and we're now breaking even."
348,00:22:51.00,00:22:51.00,">> ELISABETH: ...with the brown rice, which doesn't even equal"
349,00:22:52.77,00:22:52.77,"the white. >> KEITH: No, it does equal."
350,00:22:55.03,00:22:55.03,">> COLBY: No, it doesn't, Keith. You're arguing yourself is what"
351,00:22:57.00,00:22:57.00,you're doing because you said two times in a span of five
352,00:23:00.37,00:23:00.37,minutes that brown rice does not yield the same amount as white
353,00:23:01.83,00:23:01.83,rice. >> KEITH: I said you have to use
354,00:23:04.30,00:23:04.30,"more water to cook with. >> COLBY: No, you didn't."
355,00:23:06.43,00:23:06.43,"He's a fool. The guy's a bozo, and I'm just"
356,00:23:09.07,00:23:09.07,tired of it. I'm tired of dealing with him.
357,00:23:11.17,00:23:11.17,I don't take anything that Keith does for face value.
358,00:23:14.70,00:23:14.70,I think there's an ulterior motive to everything he says and
359,00:23:17.90,00:23:17.90,"everything he does, whether it's cooking rice or proposing to his"
360,00:23:20.53,00:23:20.53,girlfriend on-line. I don't like the way he's
361,00:23:23.03,00:23:23.03,playing the game. I think he's trying way too
362,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,hard because he can't make it on just being who he is.
363,00:23:27.97,00:23:27.97,My game with Keith is done. It's over.
364,00:23:30.07,00:23:30.07,>> KEITH: The rice cakes worked beautifully.
365,00:23:46.97,00:23:46.97,>> COLBY: As far as what's wearing on me the most: time.
366,00:23:49.73,00:23:49.73,The long days. That's the only thing getting to
367,00:23:51.60,00:23:51.60,"me, nothing else. And if it weren't for the long"
368,00:23:54.03,00:23:54.03,"days, Keith wouldn't even get to me."
369,00:23:56.13,00:23:56.13,"I mean, I wouldn't be as volatile as I am if it wasn't"

437,00:27:49.37,00:27:49.37,first settlers were prisoners brought over here from Great
438,00:27:51.80,00:27:51.80,"Britain. Now, occasionally, a prisoner"
439,00:27:54.63,00:27:54.63,"tried to escape, but the only place they had to go was into an"
440,00:27:57.53,00:27:57.53,"early grave because these escapees, known as bolters,"
441,00:28:01.67,00:28:01.67,lacked one basic thing-- they lacked basic survival skills.
442,00:28:06.17,00:28:06.17,Sun was their number one enemy. Temperatures can reach upwards
443,00:28:08.80,00:28:08.80,of 110 degrees. You can live for 30 days without
444,00:28:12.20,00:28:12.20,food. Dehydration will kill you in
445,00:28:14.50,00:28:14.50,three days. Prisoners tried to fight this by
446,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17,"taking off their clothes, which exacerbated the dehydration"
447,00:28:21.13,00:28:21.13,"process. And, in spite of how arid it is"
448,00:28:24.60,00:28:24.60,"out here, a lot of sources of water, if you know where to"
449,00:28:26.33,00:28:26.33,look. Same with food.
450,00:28:28.80,00:28:28.80,You've tasted some of the food from the outback.
451,00:28:31.23,00:28:31.23,"Mangrove worms, even spiny leaf insects, which are a better"
452,00:28:35.37,00:28:35.37,source of protein than the bigger lizards.
453,00:28:37.43,00:28:37.43,"You get tired of bugs and reptiles, bats will lead you to"
454,00:28:40.33,00:28:40.33,large fruit that is colorless but edible.
455,00:28:43.40,00:28:43.40,Birds will lead you to fruit that is pretty but inedible.
456,00:28:47.27,00:28:47.27,Their sense of geography was so skewed that they thought China
457,00:28:51.30,00:28:51.30,"and India were just around the corner, thinking China was only"
458,00:28:53.90,00:28:53.90,150 miles from Australia. Had they known some basic
459,00:28:57.53,00:28:57.53,"skills, they could have found their way."

558,00:35:15.20,00:35:15.20,Keith has driven him crazy enough that he'll vote for
559,00:35:19.40,00:35:19.40,Keith. >> TINA: Everybody have their
560,00:35:21.60,00:35:21.60,bag? >> COLBY: The biggest struggle I
561,00:35:24.47,00:35:24.47,deal with in the final few tribal councils is whether I
562,00:35:28.27,00:35:28.27,want to sit beside someone who almost guarantees me the million
563,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,"bucks or whether I want to sit beside someone who, if I don't"
564,00:35:35.50,00:35:35.50,"win the million bucks, I'll still feel good about that other"
565,00:35:37.97,00:35:37.97,person winning. I don't even have my answer to
566,00:35:39.77,00:35:39.77,"that. I did yesterday, but it changed"
567,00:35:42.10,00:35:42.10,this morning and it'll change again tonight.
568,00:36:14.07,00:36:14.07,>> JEFF: We'll bring in the jury now.
569,00:36:27.20,00:36:27.20,I'll once again remind you not to address the jury.
570,00:36:29.97,00:36:29.97,"As we wind down to six days left, certainly the information"
571,00:36:33.40,00:36:33.40,they gather at tribal councils becomes increasingly
572,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,"significant. Keith, how big of an impact does"
573,00:36:39.80,00:36:39.80,daily life have at this point? You wake up in the morning with
574,00:36:43.23,00:36:43.23,one idea of who you're going to vote out tonight.
575,00:36:45.73,00:36:45.73,"By the time you get here, it's completely different."
576,00:36:48.07,00:36:48.07,"Is that plausible, possible? >> KEITH: You know, you play a"
577,00:36:51.43,00:36:51.43,"lot of mind games with yourself. I mean, you are your own worst"
578,00:36:54.83,00:36:54.83,player at this stage of the game because you're constantly
579,00:36:58.57,00:36:58.57,"second-guessing your thought process and, you know, you're"
580,00:37:01.30,00:37:01.30,"confident here and then you're not confident there, and..."
581,00:37:03.57,00:37:03.57,"This game, as I keep saying, ""expect the unexpected"""
582,00:37:08.60,00:37:08.60,because... it's where it is right now.
583,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,>> JEFF: Is there a sense of paranoia that takes over?
584,00:37:14.73,00:37:14.73,"You see two people huddled in the corner, you think, ""I know"
585,00:37:16.80,00:37:16.80,"they're talking about me, they're going to vote me out"
586,00:37:18.20,00:37:18.20,"tonight."" Is that starting to happen?"
587,00:37:19.83,00:37:19.83,>> TINA: Absolutely. Whenever there's this few people
588,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,"left, and you think, ""This is closer than I thought and I"
589,00:37:25.53,00:37:25.53,"could make it, you know? I've only got six days left."""
590,00:37:28.60,00:37:28.60,"And then you see some people whispering and you're like, ""Oh,"
591,00:37:31.47,00:37:31.47,"my gosh, I could go tonight."" You do."
592,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,You start getting nervous and paranoid and then your whole
593,00:37:39.00,00:37:39.00,"day's blown, you know, because you don't know what's going to"
594,00:37:41.30,00:37:41.30,happen. >> JEFF: 36 days you guys have
595,00:37:44.03,00:37:44.03,"spent together. Some relationships have formed,"
596,00:37:46.73,00:37:46.73,even ones I can see from the outside.
597,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"Elisabeth, tell me about the relationship with Rodger,"
598,00:37:52.40,00:37:52.40,because you guys seem to have really connected.
599,00:37:54.97,00:37:54.97,">> ELISABETH: Rodger is... I call him my ""outback daddy."""
600,00:37:59.80,00:37:59.80,"He just really is. And from the moment I saw him, I"
601,00:38:04.93,00:38:04.93,knew that there was something special.
602,00:38:08.23,00:38:08.23,"We've become friends. I feel safe with Rodger around,"
603,00:38:13.13,00:38:13.13,and Rodger's my man. I love him.
604,00:38:17.27,00:38:17.27,">> JEFF: Rodger, how's it feel to have somebody say such kind"
605,00:38:19.90,00:38:19.90,"words about you? >> RODGER: Well, I'm very, very"
606,00:38:22.23,00:38:22.23,flattered. But I could very easily turn the
607,00:38:24.03,00:38:24.03,tables back on Elisabeth. She's a fine young lady.
608,00:38:30.33,00:38:30.33,"Character-wise, morals-wise and she's tops in my book."
609,00:38:36.07,00:38:36.07,">> JEFF: Keith, when you look at Colby with that immunity"
610,00:38:38.70,00:38:38.70,"necklace, knowing if you hadn't dropped one of your locks, you'd"
611,00:38:43.07,00:38:43.07,"be wearing it tonight, what goes through your mind?"
612,00:38:45.03,00:38:45.03,"Do you care at all? >> KEITH: You know, of course I"
613,00:38:47.27,00:38:47.27,"wish I had it around my neck, but that's the way the cookie"
614,00:38:50.17,00:38:50.17,crumbles. That was the way the game was
615,00:38:52.63,00:38:52.63,"played, and it was all fair, and I dropped the lock, and it was"
616,00:38:56.30,00:38:56.30,"my faux pas, and that's just the way it goes, part of the game."
617,00:39:00.20,00:39:00.20,What are you going to do? Can't cry over spilled milk.
618,00:39:03.80,00:39:03.80,">> JEFF: All right, guys. 11 torches behind me, five left."
619,00:39:08.73,00:39:08.73,Another torch is going to join that tonight.
620,00:39:10.90,00:39:10.90,"Let's vote. Elisabeth, you're up."
621,00:39:24.63,00:39:24.63,">> ELISABETH: This is a great group, but, Keith, I think that"
622,00:39:26.40,00:39:26.40,you've been a little overconfident and cocky about
623,00:39:30.33,00:39:30.33,how you're going to be here till the very end.
624,00:40:07.10,00:40:07.10,">> KEITH: Old buddy, I look forward to that home-cooked meal"
625,00:40:09.97,00:40:09.97,"in Kentucky. And if it's my time to go, I"
626,00:40:14.10,00:40:14.10,can't wait to see you on the outside.
627,00:40:22.00,00:40:22.00,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
628,00:40:43.83,00:40:43.83,"Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final."
629,00:40:46.53,00:40:46.53,The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the
630,00:40:48.90,00:40:48.90,tribal council area immediately. First vote...
631,00:40:54.53,00:40:54.53,Keith. Rodger.
632,00:41:09.07,00:41:09.07,Keith. Rodger.
633,00:41:18.13,00:41:18.13,"Two votes Rodger, two votes Keith."
634,00:41:20.37,00:41:20.37,One vote left. Rodger.
635,00:41:32.30,00:41:32.30,"Need to bring me your torch, Rodger."
636,00:41:33.90,00:41:33.90,">> RODGER: See you guys. See you, kiddo."
637,00:41:49.23,00:41:49.23,">> JEFF: Rodger, the tribe has spoken."
638,00:41:58.07,00:41:58.07,It's time for you to go. Grab your torches and head back
639,00:42:08.80,00:42:08.80,to camp. >> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes
640,00:42:29.67,00:42:29.67,from our next episode and hear what Rodger has to say.
641,00:42:36.03,00:42:36.03,"Next time on Survivor... Only four remain of Barramundi,"
642,00:42:40.27,00:42:40.27,and the outback has taken its toll on all of them.
643,00:42:42.80,00:42:42.80,>> ELISABETH: My hair is falling out.
644,00:42:44.60,00:42:44.60,My hair is falling out. >> JEFF: And a surprise guest
645,00:42:49.10,00:42:49.10,visits the remaining survivors. >> ELISABETH: Whoo-hoo!
646,00:42:52.70,00:42:52.70,>> TINA: Welcome to Barramundi! >> RODGER: I was the oldest
647,00:43:01.57,00:43:01.57,"person getting off the plane, 53 years old."
648,00:43:04.37,00:43:04.37,I've been out here 36 days and just had six more to go.
649,00:43:07.77,00:43:07.77,"I could've done without food for those next six days, if I'd"
650,00:43:11.33,00:43:11.33,"had to, to stayed out here. I wish them all the luck and I"
651,00:43:13.87,00:43:13.87,especially wish the best of luck to Elisabeth.
652,00:43:17.83,00:43:17.83,I hope she goes all the way. Thank you.
