571,00:29:28.38,00:29:28.38,responsibility for the losstoday because I couldn't give it
572,00:29:30.33,00:29:30.33,my all.I'm weak. I'm-I'm real weak.
573,00:29:33.04,00:29:33.04,"My stomach just feels so bad.It's like, uh, somebody's in"
574,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,there with... two boxers inthere boxing around.
575,00:29:38.62,00:29:38.62,"But, uh, I'm pretty sure thateverybody started looking at me"
576,00:29:41.21,00:29:41.21,"like, uh, ""Jerry's not gettingany better."
577,00:29:43.54,00:29:43.54,"He's probably the weakest linkon the tribe, so maybe get rid"
578,00:29:46.21,00:29:46.21,"of him.""(bird squawks)"
579,00:30:00.21,00:30:00.21,">> How you feeling, Jerry?Better?"
580,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,>> I'm gonna go take a dip.>> Okay.

584,00:30:23.25,00:30:23.25,But I felt pretty good when wewent down and got that first
585,00:30:26.25,00:30:26.25,"block, but after that all myenergy was zapped."
586,00:30:29.79,00:30:29.79,But I'm trying to... tryingto... endure.
587,00:30:35.58,00:30:35.58,Trying to tough it out best Ican.
588,00:30:38.54,00:30:38.54,"I'm not gonna quit, though.That's for sure."
589,00:30:41.21,00:30:41.21,I'm not a quitter.(chuckles)
590,00:30:44.75,00:30:44.75,They got to vote me out.I'm not giving up.

601,00:31:18.21,00:31:18.21,>> The most unfortunate thingabout this whole situation is
602,00:31:21.08,00:31:21.08,"that as soon as Erinn realizedthat Jerry was not sick, she"
603,00:31:25.00,00:31:25.00,"turned around and looked at thetribe with the evil sneer, kind"
604,00:31:29.33,00:31:29.33,"of like...""I'm staying."""
605,00:31:39.42,00:31:39.42,">> What?>> I'm so pissed off, man."
606,00:31:44.54,00:31:44.54,"When she saw Jerry, itregistered that she was still"

608,00:31:50.12,00:31:50.12,you; I practiced her look.She went like this.
609,00:31:57.17,00:31:57.17,"It was the evilest look.I can't stand it, man."
610,00:32:01.50,00:32:01.50,>> That's why I'm talking toJerry and telling him to stay
611,00:32:04.12,00:32:04.12,strong so we can get rid of her.>> I think my relationship with
612,00:32:08.17,00:32:08.17,Tyson started out like headcoach/assistant coach.
613,00:32:10.29,00:32:10.29,"But I go to him first becauseif he's my right-hand man, if"
614,00:32:12.92,00:32:12.92,"he's my general, then I want tomake sure that we're clear with"
615,00:32:16.00,00:32:16.00,our orders.>> Let's still go with Erinn.
616,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,"But Debbie and Sierra, those arethe two I'm gonna have to talk"

618,00:32:23.88,00:32:23.88,"as our weakest link.>> Well, yeah, she did know she"
619,00:32:26.29,00:32:26.29,was going home if Jerry wasn'tsick.
620,00:32:28.21,00:32:28.21,">> Yeah, and it just makes mesick because I-I exist... to"

622,00:32:35.33,00:32:35.33,exist around people like that.You guys can because you can
623,00:32:38.21,00:32:38.21,socialize with them.I am so true... that existing
624,00:32:42.25,00:32:42.25,around people that smile evillywhen somebody else is on their
625,00:32:47.12,00:32:47.12,knees kills me.I can't exist around... I can't
626,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,"look at her in camp, I can'twalk by her now."
627,00:32:52.38,00:32:52.38,">> Coach is definitely pissedabout voting out Jerry, but I am"
628,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,honestly not going to sever offanother limb so that we can get
629,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,our vendettas against Erinn.>> She's still an asset to a
630,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,certain extent.In the beginning when they saw
631,00:33:04.75,00:33:04.75,"me sick and they saw me weak,they were gonna vote me out."
632,00:33:07.75,00:33:07.75,"So, as much as I have grown toactually like and be fond of"
633,00:33:11.38,00:33:11.38,"Jerry, I'm not gonna be stupid.>> You gotta stay strong, man."
634,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,"You gotta...stick it in there if you can,"
635,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,"you know.Don't... yeah, don't give up."
636,00:33:26.96,00:33:26.96,>> Yeah.What do you have in mind?
637,00:33:31.67,00:33:31.67,>> Erinn.>> Erinn?
638,00:33:33.21,00:33:33.21,>> She was right on board withCandace.
639,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,"To me, it looks like she's justhere to lie and deceive and..."
640,00:33:39.96,00:33:39.96,"you know, get ahead any wayshe can."
641,00:33:43.17,00:33:43.17,>> Has anybody been talkingabout voting me out?
642,00:33:45.88,00:33:45.88,">> No, nobody has.You try and look as strong as"
643,00:33:48.54,00:33:48.54,you can.Don't say anything to anybody.
644,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,>> Yeah.(thunder rumbling)
645,00:34:02.21,00:34:02.21,">> With Tribal Council coming, II knew I only had a couple of"
646,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"hours to get my act togetherand go look for the idol, and so"
647,00:34:08.04,00:34:08.04,I immediately kind of went tothe one place that made the
648,00:34:10.17,00:34:10.17,"most sense to me, and that waskind of the statue next to tree"
649,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,"mail.And I got up to it, and, like,"
650,00:34:17.88,00:34:17.88,"started shaking the thing, andnothing happened."
651,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,"And I finally just, like, pushedit out and, like, tried to look"
652,00:34:22.38,00:34:22.38,underneath it because I thoughtit might be there.
653,00:34:24.79,00:34:24.79,It wasn't there.And then just started kind of
654,00:34:26.75,00:34:26.75,"feeling around and looking atthe skirt, and then kind of"
655,00:34:29.04,00:34:29.04,lifted up the skirt on thebackside of it and saw a little
656,00:34:31.25,00:34:31.25,hole and there was the idol.Yes!
657,00:34:38.75,00:34:38.75,That makes not eating for acouple of days worth it.
658,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,"Good, good, good news.It all worked out."
659,00:34:49.12,00:34:49.12,"You know, the plan worked,which was perfect."
660,00:34:51.42,00:34:51.42,"As an entrepreneur, when Ithink about business, like, to"
661,00:34:54.04,00:34:54.04,"me it was never about makingmoney, and even with Survivor"
662,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,"it's not about making money.I love winning games, I love"
663,00:34:58.62,00:34:58.62,"playing games, competing andwinning them."
664,00:35:02.38,00:35:02.38,So as long as you're focused ondoing something that you love
665,00:35:05.04,00:35:05.04,"and you're playing the game theright way, good stuff happens."
666,00:35:08.79,00:35:08.79,"Keep my fingers crossed.>> Jerry, you want some beans?"
667,00:35:22.96,00:35:22.96,">> Like you don't want to belike, hey, everybody, Jerry's"
668,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,"sick, but you kind of want to belike, hey, everybody, Jerry's"
669,00:35:30.04,00:35:30.04,"sick.And trying to, like, wrestle"
670,00:35:33.54,00:35:33.54,"with all these options of,like, how do you bring it up"
671,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,"delicately, how do you make itlook like you're not trying to"
672,00:35:38.42,00:35:38.42,throw someone under the bus orsave your own ass because every
673,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,time we send someone home whodoesn't want to be here it
674,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,leaves a space for someone whodoes and I want to be here so
675,00:35:47.75,00:35:47.75,"see you, Jerry.>> Where's the thumb meter?"
676,00:35:54.21,00:35:54.21,Sideways?>> I'm doing better.
677,00:35:58.04,00:35:58.04,Thumb is sideways right now.It was down; now it's sideways.
678,00:36:01.79,00:36:01.79,">> It's moving up.>> Yeah, it's moving up."
679,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,"Taste of a good cheeseburger,I'd be back on top."
680,00:36:08.04,00:36:08.04,"(laughing)>> Yeah, I think Jerry's"
681,00:36:16.25,00:36:16.25,illness has put a couple ofeyeballs on him.
682,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,"I mean, if he's in pain andcan't compete in the"
683,00:36:20.08,00:36:20.08,"challenges, if he's the weaklink and it comes to Tribal"
684,00:36:22.54,00:36:22.54,"Council, he could be the nextone to go."
685,00:36:25.79,00:36:25.79,"But anytime there's ablindside, it's pretty awesome,"
686,00:36:28.00,00:36:28.00,just the look on somebody'sface.
687,00:36:31.17,00:36:31.17,"I think Erinn wants to be hereso, so bad, that her getting"
688,00:36:34.58,00:36:34.58,blindsided would look reallycool.
689,00:36:38.12,00:36:38.12,I love seeing people cry whenyou crush their dreams.

691,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,Jalapao clearly has it.How important is it in a game
692,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,like this?>> Momentum's extremely
693,00:37:05.54,00:37:05.54,important.I think we got a little bit
694,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,"arrogant, and they're on a highright now, and we're on a low."
695,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,"I mean, it doesn't take much toregain momentum, just a win."
696,00:37:15.54,00:37:15.54,If we can all focus and gettogether then it can flip-flop
697,00:37:18.92,00:37:18.92,"pretty fast.>> PROBST: Well, what I noticed"
698,00:37:21.71,00:37:21.71,"today in the challenge was Erinnright off the bat said, ""I have"

703,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,"nothing and then went, ""Oh,yeah, okay, that is right."""
704,00:37:36.96,00:37:36.96,And it was too late by then.>> PROBST: How frustrating is
705,00:37:39.62,00:37:39.62,that for you when you felt likeyou knew it all along?
706,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,>> I...it was just frustrating.
707,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,">> PROBST: Brendan, do you thinkthis group communicates as well"

710,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,shaking your head back andforth as fast as you could.
711,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,">> Well, for instance, intoday's challenge, if we'd of"
712,00:37:59.29,00:37:59.29,"had a controlling person to say,""Okay, you got it; we're all"

718,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,"should be leading this tribe?>> Being the devil's advocate,"
719,00:38:18.21,00:38:18.21,let's say Brendan is theleader; he has to take the
720,00:38:20.42,00:38:20.42,reins.I'm not suggesting that I'm the
721,00:38:22.96,00:38:22.96,"leader, but on the truck I wasmaking eye contact with"
722,00:38:25.88,00:38:25.88,everybody and the reason why itworked so smoothly is because I
723,00:38:28.71,00:38:28.71,basically told everybody withmy eyes to get what they needed
724,00:38:32.38,00:38:32.38,to get.>> PROBST: So it sounds like you
725,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,"should be leading.>> Well, absolutely, I would"
726,00:38:36.00,00:38:36.00,love to be leader.That's what I'm used to doing.
727,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,>> PROBST: Erinn you had aboutfive different reactions.
728,00:38:40.08,00:38:40.08,Just share one with me.>> I think it's a role that
729,00:38:42.54,00:38:42.54,Coach is used to.It's a role that he would love
730,00:38:45.08,00:38:45.08,"to be in,  but it's somethingthat Brendan does better."

738,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,"you're going to do."">> PROBST: So you're saying"
739,00:39:10.83,00:39:10.83,"he's a littlepassive-aggressive, throwing"
740,00:39:12.50,00:39:12.50,"throwing out an idea, but notowning it?"

742,00:39:16.46,00:39:16.46,to hear?'Cause it sounds like what
743,00:39:18.46,00:39:18.46,you're struggling with a littlebit is ego.
744,00:39:21.12,00:39:21.12,>> It's not about ego becauseI would rather toe the line and
745,00:39:24.42,00:39:24.42,be a good assistant coach thantry to be a head coach and
746,00:39:27.12,00:39:27.12,stroke my ego.What I was doing was I
