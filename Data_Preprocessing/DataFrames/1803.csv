7,00:00:13.67,00:00:13.67,>> You're taking out some frustration.
8,00:00:15.04,00:00:15.04,">> No, you're taking out frustration."

12,00:00:27.12,00:00:27.12,at Exile Island. >> Taj.
13,00:00:28.92,00:00:28.92,>> PROBST: Taj from Jalapao and Brendan from Timbira went
14,00:00:32.21,00:00:32.21,"to Exile Island and agreed to work together, despite being"
15,00:00:35.67,00:00:35.67,on different tribes. They shared a clue to new

19,00:00:47.25,00:00:47.25,"Tribal Council, turned their sights on Sierra."
20,00:00:53.29,00:00:53.29,">> Okay, got it. >> PROBST: But when Candace"
21,00:00:56.00,00:00:56.00,"turned on Coach... >> Oh, yeah."
22,00:01:00.71,00:01:00.71,>> PROBST: ...he retaliated. >> She got on me.
23,00:01:02.75,00:01:02.75,She's going to get on everybody. The cancer will ruin the tribe.
24,00:01:06.29,00:01:06.29,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Sierra was saved and Coach got"
25,00:01:10.12,00:01:10.12,"his way. Candace, the tribe has spoken."
26,00:01:14.62,00:01:14.62,14 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
27,00:01:30.17,00:01:30.17,>> The last thing in the world I wanted to do was give Candace
28,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,any idea that I was voting for her.
29,00:01:35.29,00:01:35.29,"And, like, not knowing what everybody else was doing, I was"
30,00:01:39.33,00:01:39.33,"like, oh, my God. This could be the very last"
31,00:01:41.58,00:01:41.58,"nail in my own coffin. >> Erinn, obviously didn't see"
32,00:01:46.12,00:01:46.12,"it coming for us voting Candace. And then when she did, she's"
33,00:01:50.25,00:01:50.25,"trying to, she's trying to back out really fast."
34,00:01:52.79,00:01:52.79,She's-she's kind of panicking. >> You guys were pretty
35,00:01:55.46,00:01:55.46,attached at the hips the last two days.
36,00:01:58.00,00:01:58.00,>> 'Cause I wasn't sure about her.
37,00:01:59.92,00:01:59.92,>> But she was turning on the rest of us.
38,00:02:01.75,00:02:01.75,>> Yeah. >> And you...
39,00:02:03.33,00:02:03.33,>> But I did know though... >> You knew that.
40,00:02:06.21,00:02:06.21,">> You knew she was turning on the rest of us, right?"
41,00:02:08.42,00:02:08.42,">> But, like, it just really wasn't a decision that I wanted"
42,00:02:11.25,00:02:11.25,"to make lightly until I felt like, felt like I knew her"
43,00:02:14.00,00:02:14.00,"pretty well. And once I did, I just felt"
44,00:02:16.58,00:02:16.58,like I could not trust her for a second.
45,00:02:20.33,00:02:20.33,>> Not only did she align herself with the wrong person--
46,00:02:23.25,00:02:23.25,Candace-- she's has completely insulted all of our
47,00:02:26.88,00:02:26.88,"intelligences when we came back tonight and she said, ""You"
48,00:02:30.62,00:02:30.62,"know, I've just been hanging around with Candace the last"
49,00:02:32.21,00:02:32.21,couple of days because I just wanted to see what she was up
50,00:02:36.04,00:02:36.04,"to because I didn't trust her."" >> We weren't not getting along."
51,00:02:39.17,00:02:39.17,"I was very cautious with her. But I wasn't like, ""Okay, we're"
52,00:02:42.83,00:02:42.83,"best friends."" Well, it's all over with, so"
53,00:02:45.17,00:02:45.17,that's good. >> For her to say that to us is
54,00:02:50.50,00:02:50.50,"insulting, which is why she never would have been in my"
55,00:02:53.21,00:02:53.21,alliance from the very beginning.
56,00:02:54.79,00:02:54.79,"And she's made her bed, and she's going to have to lie in"
57,00:02:56.83,00:02:56.83,it. (theme song playing)

61,00:04:30.21,00:04:30.21,"this again? I go, ""Okay, a million dollars,"
62,00:04:34.75,00:04:34.75,"a million dollars."" >> Yeah."
63,00:04:36.12,00:04:36.12,(laughter) >> Getting back from Tribal
64,00:04:39.62,00:04:39.62,Council was a little weird. >> Morning.
65,00:04:42.62,00:04:42.62,>> Hi. >> How you doing?
66,00:04:44.96,00:04:44.96,>> I think that the time that I spent with Candace in the last
67,00:04:47.75,00:04:47.75,few days probably associated me a little bit with her more than
68,00:04:51.62,00:04:51.62,I would have liked. Now I have to turn girl that
69,00:04:54.88,00:04:54.88,maybe is kind of on the outs a little bit into absolutely the
70,00:04:59.08,00:04:59.08,opposite of that. >> Got to win this challenge
71,00:05:01.25,00:05:01.25,"today, man. We got to be absolute animals"
72,00:05:03.08,00:05:03.08,today. >> I think it's really
73,00:05:04.58,00:05:04.58,"important that we win challenges, so I have to go in"
74,00:05:06.75,00:05:06.75,there and I have to outperform. Do I think that I can outperform
75,00:05:10.04,00:05:10.04,Sierra and Debbie? I think so.
76,00:05:12.71,00:05:12.71,"I'm just going to have to really, really suck it up and do"
77,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,it because now I feel like I'm kind of fighting for my life a
78,00:05:17.54,00:05:17.54,"little bit. >> Unfortunately, that's all"
79,00:05:26.67,00:05:26.67,"we've got for breakfast, Jerry. Yeah, but you didn't eat"
80,00:05:31.96,00:05:31.96,"dinner, either. >> Oh, my God, yeah."
81,00:05:35.58,00:05:35.58,">> Well, it maybe-maybe had been what had my, uh, stomach screwed"
82,00:05:39.54,00:05:39.54,up. >> Ugh.
83,00:05:44.67,00:05:44.67,>> Yeah. Best beans I ever had.
84,00:05:48.75,00:05:48.75,>> I'm not feeling too hot these last couple days.
85,00:05:51.92,00:05:51.92,I don't know whether it's the beans or something I've been
86,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,eating or something that's been causing my stomach to hurt real
87,00:05:56.38,00:05:56.38,bad. >> You're sure not digging in
88,00:05:58.92,00:05:58.92,"like you usually do, buddy. (chuckles)"
89,00:06:01.71,00:06:01.71,">> Oh, he's taking it slow and steady."
90,00:06:03.88,00:06:03.88,>> Yeah. I'm used to some type of
91,00:06:06.17,00:06:06.17,"situations like this when I was in, uh, Afghanistan or"
92,00:06:09.04,00:06:09.04,"different-- other military spots, so--"
93,00:06:11.42,00:06:11.42,I never like to show weakness anywhere I go.
94,00:06:13.46,00:06:13.46,I always want to be looked upon as one of the stronger ones.
95,00:06:17.50,00:06:17.50,"While everybody is doing their normal activities, I got to"
96,00:06:20.12,00:06:20.12,"pretend that I'm happy, but really inside, it's miserable."
97,00:06:24.21,00:06:24.21,(chuckles) I'm-I'm trying to fight through
98,00:06:26.17,00:06:26.17,"this. I figure another day or so, I"
99,00:06:27.50,00:06:27.50,should be good. (groans)
100,00:06:29.54,00:06:29.54,">> How you feeling, Jerry? >> Mother said there'd be days"
101,00:06:33.79,00:06:33.79,like this. >> Yeah.
102,00:06:35.00,00:06:35.00,(Jerry chuckles) >> There are a bunch over here.
103,00:06:42.92,00:06:42.92,"You want to move on this side? >> Yeah, sure."
104,00:06:45.29,00:06:45.29,"I see some over here. >> There's a couple in there,"
105,00:06:47.71,00:06:47.71,small ones. >> There are a bunch of small
106,00:06:49.67,00:06:49.67,ones over here. >> There's some right-right
107,00:06:51.21,00:06:51.21,under me. >> Drop it.
108,00:06:54.08,00:06:54.08,He was right here. Let's make sure.
109,00:06:56.12,00:06:56.12,">> We got fishing gear in the challenge yesterday, and we were"
110,00:06:59.62,00:06:59.62,all so psyched. We assume... I think we all
111,00:07:01.50,00:07:01.50,imagined that we would be feasting on plates of fish.
112,00:07:05.38,00:07:05.38,">> I see some over here. >> There's a couple in there,"
113,00:07:07.67,00:07:07.67,small ones. >> There's a big one right here.
114,00:07:09.50,00:07:09.50,"If we can get it over enough, we can catch him."
115,00:07:11.83,00:07:11.83,">> Toss it far. >> One, two, three."
116,00:07:16.08,00:07:16.08,You threw it on my head. >> I'm sorry.
117,00:07:17.75,00:07:17.75,">> That might, it might be all right."
118,00:07:19.62,00:07:19.62,">> No, he got out. >> We're having a lot of"
119,00:07:22.46,00:07:22.46,problems catching minnows. We're not entirely sure how to
120,00:07:26.62,00:07:26.62,"use the net. J.T. thinks it's a throw net,"
121,00:07:28.96,00:07:28.96,but it seems way too big for one person to throw.
122,00:07:31.33,00:07:31.33,So we... I think we need to figure out a good system.
123,00:07:34.83,00:07:34.83,">> One, two, three. It's still not easy, but, you"
124,00:07:45.04,00:07:45.04,"know, we figured out, you know, live bait with the minnows is"
125,00:07:47.58,00:07:47.58,definitely the way to go. This water is just a little
126,00:07:49.92,00:07:49.92,"different from where I came from, but we'll get it under"
127,00:07:51.96,00:07:51.96,"control. >> Oh, baby, come on in."
128,00:07:56.88,00:07:56.88,>> You see him? >> Got him.
129,00:07:59.83,00:07:59.83,>> Woo-hoo! >> Attaboy.
130,00:08:03.71,00:08:03.71,">> All right. Attaboy, J."
131,00:08:07.00,00:08:07.00,>> Think this may be first fish I've ever caught.
132,00:08:09.42,00:08:09.42,">> Oh, it is. Good."
133,00:08:11.38,00:08:11.38,">> Oh, oh! I got one, buddy!"
134,00:08:13.83,00:08:13.83,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God!"
135,00:08:17.12,00:08:17.12,Whoa! That is a fish.
136,00:08:19.17,00:08:19.17,"Hello, dinner. >> That's right."
137,00:08:21.21,00:08:21.21,>> My biggest fish yet. >> I could eat.
138,00:08:29.38,00:08:29.38,>> Today is the first day I feel really hungry.
139,00:08:31.71,00:08:31.71,>> Look at that. >> That one looks delish.
140,00:08:33.21,00:08:33.21,">> Oh, my God. It's like a feast."
141,00:08:36.46,00:08:36.46,Mmm. >> It's amazing how it doesn't
142,00:08:39.08,00:08:39.08,"need seasoning. It just tastes well seasoned,"
143,00:08:40.71,00:08:40.71,doesn't it? >> Yeah.
144,00:08:42.33,00:08:42.33,">> Thank you, guys. >> Thank you, guys."
145,00:08:45.38,00:08:45.38,>> Did you eat that skin? >> That fish tasted just like
146,00:08:48.08,00:08:48.08,victory. Just knowing that we got a
147,00:08:50.12,00:08:50.12,"little food, finally using the fishing gear the way it should"
148,00:08:53.12,00:08:53.12,"be used, I think it means that we're just a force to be"
149,00:08:55.79,00:08:55.79,"reckoned with right now. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
150,00:09:11.38,00:09:11.38,Jalapao getting your first look at the new Timbira.
151,00:09:14.46,00:09:14.46,Candace voted out at the last Tribal Council.
152,00:09:19.04,00:09:19.04,"For today's challenge, six members of each tribe will be"
153,00:09:22.29,00:09:22.29,blindfolded and tied together in pairs.
154,00:09:25.42,00:09:25.42,The remaining tribe member will guide you through a maze.
155,00:09:28.25,00:09:28.25,"You'll locate your bucket, then make your way to a water tower,"
156,00:09:31.58,00:09:31.58,"where you must fill your bucket, then race back to the start and"
157,00:09:35.21,00:09:35.21,"empty the water into a container, raising a flag."
158,00:09:38.25,00:09:38.25,"You'll then repeat the process, this time collecting corn from"
159,00:09:41.58,00:09:41.58,another tower. First tribe to fill both
160,00:09:44.17,00:09:44.17,"containers, raising both flags, wins reward."
161,00:09:46.33,00:09:46.33,Want to know what you're playing for?
162,00:09:47.71,00:09:47.71,">> Yes, please! >> PROBST: It starts with this"
163,00:09:50.04,00:09:50.04,tarp. >> Oh!
164,00:09:52.08,00:09:52.08,(shrieking) >> PROBST: It includes an

166,00:09:56.08,00:09:56.08,"In addition, the winning tribe will choose one member of the"
167,00:09:59.83,00:09:59.83,"losing tribe to go to Exile Island, and that person will"
168,00:10:03.08,00:10:03.08,select somebody from the winning tribe to join them.
169,00:10:06.04,00:10:06.04,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
170,00:10:07.96,00:10:07.96,>> PROBST: Give you a minute to figure out who's gonna be
171,00:10:09.88,00:10:09.88,"blindfolded, who's gonna be the guide."
172,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,We'll get started. The caller for Jalapao: Joe.
173,00:10:17.54,00:10:17.54,"For Timbira: Debra. Here we go, for reward."
174,00:10:21.17,00:10:21.17,Survivors ready? Go!
175,00:10:23.25,00:10:23.25,">> J.T., Sydney, go left. Y'all start moving, Spencer."
176,00:10:26.46,00:10:26.46,>> Straight! Straight!
177,00:10:28.00,00:10:28.00,>> PROBST: Take a lot of teamwork to figure this out.
178,00:10:30.33,00:10:30.33,">> Straight, straight, straight! >> J.T., start inching left."
179,00:10:33.42,00:10:33.42,>> PROBST: First thing you have to do is find your buckets.
180,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,Each pair will have a bucket. >> I got a bucket.
181,00:10:39.29,00:10:39.29,">> PROBST: J.T.'s got a bucket. >> Right, right, right!"
182,00:10:41.79,00:10:41.79,Faster! Forward!

186,00:10:49.12,00:10:49.12,Spencer's got a bucket. Jalapao has their buckets.
187,00:10:52.54,00:10:52.54,Now you got to start collecting water.
188,00:10:54.75,00:10:54.75,">> Spencer, water's to your right!"
189,00:10:57.12,00:10:57.12,">> Water's on your right, right! >> Step straight!"

352,00:18:19.08,00:18:19.08,"away, I'll eventually make coach."
353,00:18:21.12,00:18:21.12,He may promote me. I don't know if I'll have my
354,00:18:22.67,00:18:22.67,"own team or will be co-coach, or whatever."
355,00:18:25.12,00:18:25.12,But people are going to start calling me that.
356,00:18:27.21,00:18:27.21,I'm actually going to demand it. If we ever get put on separate
357,00:18:30.62,00:18:30.62,"tribes in this game, I will demand that the other tribe"
358,00:18:34.12,00:18:34.12,"calls me ""Coach,"" too. >> On three."

379,00:19:39.71,00:19:39.71,they're getting soaked and we're staying dry and that's
380,00:19:42.04,00:19:42.04,going to make a big difference on the next challenge.
381,00:19:49.46,00:19:49.46,>> To say... To say something about the fact

383,00:19:56.25,00:19:56.25,took my other blanket and brought it to Exile.
384,00:19:58.54,00:19:58.54,(thunder rumbles) >> Judging on the fact that
385,00:20:02.12,00:20:02.12,"Jalapao seems to be a hell of a lot dirtier than us, they"
386,00:20:05.38,00:20:05.38,probably need that stuff more than we do.
387,00:20:07.54,00:20:07.54,I don't care about comfort. No shelter.
388,00:20:10.25,00:20:10.25,"Let me bury myself in the sand, get eaten by tarantulas and"
389,00:20:13.29,00:20:13.29,bitten by snakes. I don't care about comfort
390,00:20:14.83,00:20:14.83,anymore. I don't want care about
391,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,anything else except for winning this game.

395,00:20:36.04,00:20:36.04,I got it this time. Open in private.
396,00:20:39.67,00:20:39.67,All right. I'll be back in two seconds.
397,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,>> Okay. >> Clue Two.

401,00:20:53.71,00:20:53.71,>> What do we got? >> It's back home.
402,00:20:55.25,00:20:55.25,It's surrounded by wood. >> We got another clue.
403,00:20:57.96,00:20:57.96,>> We got another clue. We got another clue.
404,00:20:59.83,00:20:59.83,">> Oh, perfect. Perfect!"
405,00:21:01.46,00:21:01.46,">> Oh, good. Brendan and I back in Exile"
406,00:21:04.33,00:21:04.33,Island. He's kind of working right
407,00:21:06.54,00:21:06.54,along with me. We both have the same goals in
408,00:21:08.38,00:21:08.38,mind in that we're trying to find the idol so we can both be
409,00:21:11.75,00:21:11.75,"safe in the long run. So, then, we have at least three"
410,00:21:14.04,00:21:14.04,days... Or two days after we get back
411,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,from Exile to find it on our own.
412,00:21:18.75,00:21:18.75,">> When I get back to camp, I'm going to look for the idol"
413,00:21:20.29,00:21:20.29,immediately and the first place I'm going to look is something
414,00:21:22.58,00:21:22.58,"that's surrounded by wood. When I hear, ""surrounded by"
415,00:21:24.83,00:21:24.83,"wood,"" I think of my shelter. I think of the tree mail area."
416,00:21:28.96,00:21:28.96,So that's probably where I'll take a peek.
417,00:21:34.29,00:21:34.29,The key is getting the immunity idol.
418,00:21:36.21,00:21:36.21,>> I know. If we don't find it by the time
419,00:21:38.21,00:21:38.21,"somebody else gets here and gets a clue, then we're outed."
420,00:21:40.33,00:21:40.33,Unless we can convince them to send us again.
421,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,">> God... Hopefully, we can and we'll"
422,00:21:45.50,00:21:45.50,work on that. >> Right.
423,00:21:46.71,00:21:46.71,">> But if we can't, who else do we send?"
424,00:21:49.12,00:21:49.12,>> Steve. Do Steve and I'll prep him
425,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"before the next challenge, so he'll know."
426,00:21:54.71,00:21:54.71,">> Okay. So then, like, I'll go to"
427,00:21:58.62,00:21:58.62,Sierra. >> Are you sure you can trust
428,00:22:00.42,00:22:00.42,"Sierra? >> Yeah, I think I can."
429,00:22:02.71,00:22:02.71,>> Okay. >> I'll make sure.
430,00:22:05.21,00:22:05.21,>> You work Sierra. I'll work Steve.
431,00:22:07.08,00:22:07.08,>> Yeah. >> Once we make it to the
432,00:22:09.21,00:22:09.21,"merge, we would have a four-way alliance that nobody knows"
433,00:22:13.08,00:22:13.08,about. >> That nobody knows about.
434,00:22:14.33,00:22:14.33,>> Exactly. If Brendan and I can line up
435,00:22:16.54,00:22:16.54,"our cards exactly the way we want them, we'll have a secret"
436,00:22:19.38,00:22:19.38,four-way alliance that no one knows about.
437,00:22:21.54,00:22:21.54,This is going to slap them behind the head and they won't
438,00:22:23.79,00:22:23.79,even know it was coming. >> You're the best accomplice
439,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,ever. Ever!

451,00:23:14.67,00:23:14.67,So that made us all sleep pretty soundly.

564,00:29:07.12,00:29:07.12,nothing for you. You guys have the night off.
565,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
566,00:29:10.88,00:29:10.88,">> (whoops) >> PROBST: Timbira, momentum has"
567,00:29:15.00,00:29:15.00,definitely shifted. Three straight wins by Jalapao.
568,00:29:19.38,00:29:19.38,"Another loss, another trip to Tribal Council, another tribe"
569,00:29:22.88,00:29:22.88,member going home. Grab your stuff.
570,00:29:24.17,00:29:24.17,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal
571,00:29:26.42,00:29:26.42,tonight. >> I feel a great deal of
572,00:29:28.38,00:29:28.38,responsibility for the loss today because I couldn't give it
573,00:29:30.33,00:29:30.33,my all. I'm weak. I'm-I'm real weak.
574,00:29:33.04,00:29:33.04,"My stomach just feels so bad. It's like, uh, somebody's in"
575,00:29:36.21,00:29:36.21,there with... two boxers in there boxing around.
576,00:29:38.62,00:29:38.62,"But, uh, I'm pretty sure that everybody started looking at me"
577,00:29:41.21,00:29:41.21,"like, uh, ""Jerry's not getting any better."
578,00:29:43.54,00:29:43.54,"He's probably the weakest link on the tribe, so maybe get rid"
579,00:29:46.21,00:29:46.21,"of him."" (bird squawks)"
580,00:30:00.21,00:30:00.21,">> How you feeling, Jerry? Better?"
581,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,>> I'm gonna go take a dip. >> Okay.
582,00:30:08.42,00:30:08.42,">> Jerry, there's some extra water over here."
583,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,Do you want me to fill your canteen?
584,00:30:15.25,00:30:15.25,"You sure? >> Yeah, I got plenty here."
585,00:30:23.25,00:30:23.25,But I felt pretty good when we went down and got that first
586,00:30:26.25,00:30:26.25,"block, but after that all my energy was zapped."
587,00:30:29.79,00:30:29.79,But I'm trying to... trying to... endure.
588,00:30:35.58,00:30:35.58,Trying to tough it out best I can.
589,00:30:38.54,00:30:38.54,"I'm not gonna quit, though. That's for sure."
590,00:30:41.21,00:30:41.21,I'm not a quitter. (chuckles)
591,00:30:44.75,00:30:44.75,They got to vote me out. I'm not giving up.
592,00:30:51.17,00:30:51.17,>> I think we had a communication breakdown at some
593,00:30:53.88,00:30:53.88,"point today, and I can't quite figure out what it was."
594,00:30:57.33,00:30:57.33,">> We got this, we're just... it's just the beginning of the"
595,00:30:59.62,00:30:59.62,game. >> We're just one behind.
596,00:31:01.38,00:31:01.38,"We're one person behind now. >> Yeah, it's, like, no big"
597,00:31:03.79,00:31:03.79,deal; we'll figure it out. Is Jerry okay?
598,00:31:06.04,00:31:06.04,">> The beans are making him sick, and that's all we... you"
599,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,"know, we can't eat all the rice. >> Shut up."
600,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,>> 'Cause he won't eat the beans.
601,00:31:12.92,00:31:12.92,">> He can't... he hasn't eaten, really, in... since you've left."
602,00:31:18.21,00:31:18.21,>> The most unfortunate thing about this whole situation is
603,00:31:21.08,00:31:21.08,"that as soon as Erinn realized that Jerry was not sick, she"
604,00:31:25.00,00:31:25.00,"turned around and looked at the tribe with the evil sneer, kind"
605,00:31:29.33,00:31:29.33,"of like... ""I'm staying."""
606,00:31:39.42,00:31:39.42,">> What? >> I'm so pissed off, man."
607,00:31:44.54,00:31:44.54,"When she saw Jerry, it registered that she was still"
608,00:31:48.12,00:31:48.12,staying. She went... I'm not kidding
609,00:31:50.12,00:31:50.12,you; I practiced her look. She went like this.
610,00:31:57.17,00:31:57.17,"It was the evilest look. I can't stand it, man."
611,00:32:01.50,00:32:01.50,>> That's why I'm talking to Jerry and telling him to stay
612,00:32:04.12,00:32:04.12,strong so we can get rid of her. >> I think my relationship with
613,00:32:08.17,00:32:08.17,Tyson started out like head coach/assistant coach.
614,00:32:10.29,00:32:10.29,"But I go to him first because if he's my right-hand man, if"
615,00:32:12.92,00:32:12.92,"he's my general, then I want to make sure that we're clear with"
616,00:32:16.00,00:32:16.00,our orders. >> Let's still go with Erinn.
617,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,"But Debbie and Sierra, those are the two I'm gonna have to talk"
618,00:32:21.17,00:32:21.17,"to. >> I mean, we're only as strong"
619,00:32:23.88,00:32:23.88,"as our weakest link. >> Well, yeah, she did know she"
620,00:32:26.29,00:32:26.29,was going home if Jerry wasn't sick.
621,00:32:28.21,00:32:28.21,">> Yeah, and it just makes me sick because I-I exist... to"
622,00:32:31.67,00:32:31.67,"surround myself with people that have integrity, and I cannot"
623,00:32:35.33,00:32:35.33,exist around people like that. You guys can because you can
624,00:32:38.21,00:32:38.21,socialize with them. I am so true... that existing
625,00:32:42.25,00:32:42.25,around people that smile evilly when somebody else is on their
626,00:32:47.12,00:32:47.12,knees kills me. I can't exist around... I can't
627,00:32:49.04,00:32:49.04,"look at her in camp, I can't walk by her now."
628,00:32:52.38,00:32:52.38,">> Coach is definitely pissed about voting out Jerry, but I am"
629,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,honestly not going to sever off another limb so that we can get
630,00:32:59.17,00:32:59.17,our vendettas against Erinn. >> She's still an asset to a
631,00:33:02.79,00:33:02.79,certain extent. In the beginning when they saw
632,00:33:04.75,00:33:04.75,"me sick and they saw me weak, they were gonna vote me out."
633,00:33:07.75,00:33:07.75,"So, as much as I have grown to actually like and be fond of"
634,00:33:11.38,00:33:11.38,"Jerry, I'm not gonna be stupid. >> You gotta stay strong, man."
635,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,"You gotta... stick it in there if you can,"
636,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,"you know. Don't... yeah, don't give up."
637,00:33:26.96,00:33:26.96,>> Yeah. What do you have in mind?
638,00:33:31.67,00:33:31.67,>> Erinn. >> Erinn?
639,00:33:33.21,00:33:33.21,>> She was right on board with Candace.
640,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,"To me, it looks like she's just here to lie and deceive and..."
641,00:33:39.96,00:33:39.96,"you know, get ahead any way she can."
642,00:33:43.17,00:33:43.17,>> Has anybody been talking about voting me out?
643,00:33:45.88,00:33:45.88,">> No, nobody has. You try and look as strong as"
644,00:33:48.54,00:33:48.54,you can. Don't say anything to anybody.
645,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,>> Yeah. (thunder rumbling)
646,00:34:02.21,00:34:02.21,">> With Tribal Council coming, I I knew I only had a couple of"
647,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"hours to get my act together and go look for the idol, and so"
648,00:34:08.04,00:34:08.04,I immediately kind of went to the one place that made the
649,00:34:10.17,00:34:10.17,"most sense to me, and that was kind of the statue next to tree"
650,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,"mail. And I got up to it, and, like,"
651,00:34:17.88,00:34:17.88,"started shaking the thing, and nothing happened."
652,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,"And I finally just, like, pushed it out and, like, tried to look"
653,00:34:22.38,00:34:22.38,underneath it because I thought it might be there.
654,00:34:24.79,00:34:24.79,It wasn't there. And then just started kind of
655,00:34:26.75,00:34:26.75,"feeling around and looking at the skirt, and then kind of"
656,00:34:29.04,00:34:29.04,lifted up the skirt on the backside of it and saw a little
657,00:34:31.25,00:34:31.25,hole and there was the idol. Yes!
658,00:34:38.75,00:34:38.75,That makes not eating for a couple of days worth it.
659,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,"Good, good, good news. It all worked out."
660,00:34:49.12,00:34:49.12,"You know, the plan worked, which was perfect."
661,00:34:51.42,00:34:51.42,"As an entrepreneur, when I think about business, like, to"
662,00:34:54.04,00:34:54.04,"me it was never about making money, and even with Survivor"
663,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,"it's not about making money. I love winning games, I love"
664,00:34:58.62,00:34:58.62,"playing games, competing and winning them."
665,00:35:02.38,00:35:02.38,So as long as you're focused on doing something that you love
666,00:35:05.04,00:35:05.04,"and you're playing the game the right way, good stuff happens."
667,00:35:08.79,00:35:08.79,"Keep my fingers crossed. >> Jerry, you want some beans?"
668,00:35:22.96,00:35:22.96,">> Like you don't want to be like, hey, everybody, Jerry's"
669,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,"sick, but you kind of want to be like, hey, everybody, Jerry's"
670,00:35:30.04,00:35:30.04,"sick. And trying to, like, wrestle"
671,00:35:33.54,00:35:33.54,"with all these options of, like, how do you bring it up"
672,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,"delicately, how do you make it look like you're not trying to"
673,00:35:38.42,00:35:38.42,throw someone under the bus or save your own ass because every
674,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,time we send someone home who doesn't want to be here it
675,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,leaves a space for someone who does and I want to be here so
676,00:35:47.75,00:35:47.75,"see you, Jerry. >> Where's the thumb meter?"
677,00:35:54.21,00:35:54.21,Sideways? >> I'm doing better.
678,00:35:58.04,00:35:58.04,Thumb is sideways right now. It was down; now it's sideways.
679,00:36:01.79,00:36:01.79,">> It's moving up. >> Yeah, it's moving up."
680,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,"Taste of a good cheeseburger, I'd be back on top."
681,00:36:08.04,00:36:08.04,"(laughing) >> Yeah, I think Jerry's"
682,00:36:16.25,00:36:16.25,illness has put a couple of eyeballs on him.
683,00:36:18.00,00:36:18.00,"I mean, if he's in pain and can't compete in the"
684,00:36:20.08,00:36:20.08,"challenges, if he's the weak link and it comes to Tribal"
685,00:36:22.54,00:36:22.54,"Council, he could be the next one to go."
686,00:36:25.79,00:36:25.79,"But anytime there's a blindside, it's pretty awesome,"
687,00:36:28.00,00:36:28.00,just the look on somebody's face.
688,00:36:31.17,00:36:31.17,"I think Erinn wants to be here so, so bad, that her getting"
689,00:36:34.58,00:36:34.58,blindsided would look really cool.
690,00:36:38.12,00:36:38.12,I love seeing people cry when you crush their dreams.
691,00:36:56.88,00:36:56.88,">> PROBST: Tyson, let's talk about momentum."
692,00:37:00.25,00:37:00.25,Jalapao clearly has it. How important is it in a game
693,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,like this? >> Momentum's extremely
694,00:37:05.54,00:37:05.54,important. I think we got a little bit
695,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,"arrogant, and they're on a high right now, and we're on a low."
696,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,"I mean, it doesn't take much to regain momentum, just a win."
697,00:37:15.54,00:37:15.54,If we can all focus and get together then it can flip-flop
698,00:37:18.92,00:37:18.92,"pretty fast. >> PROBST: Well, what I noticed"
699,00:37:21.71,00:37:21.71,"today in the challenge was Erinn right off the bat said, ""I have"
700,00:37:24.42,00:37:24.42,"a plan, let's follow it,"" and it was over."
701,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,>> That's exactly what happened.
702,00:37:29.42,00:37:29.42,"I said, ""This piece goes here."" Everybody said, ""No, no, no,"
703,00:37:31.75,00:37:31.75,"that's not right."" People panicked and we all did"
704,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,"nothing and then went, ""Oh, yeah, okay, that is right."""
705,00:37:36.96,00:37:36.96,And it was too late by then. >> PROBST: How frustrating is
706,00:37:39.62,00:37:39.62,that for you when you felt like you knew it all along?
707,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,>> I... it was just frustrating.
708,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,">> PROBST: Brendan, do you think this group communicates as well"
709,00:37:49.12,00:37:49.12,as it needs to? >> I think we communicate very
710,00:37:51.88,00:37:51.88,"well. >> PROBST: Jerry, you were"
711,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,shaking your head back and forth as fast as you could.
712,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,">> Well, for instance, in today's challenge, if we'd of"
713,00:37:59.29,00:37:59.29,"had a controlling person to say, ""Okay, you got it; we're all"
714,00:38:03.25,00:38:03.25,"going to listen to you, bam."" But that didn't happen."
715,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,We just need to establish a leader.
716,00:38:08.04,00:38:08.04,">> PROBST: Who should it be, Jerry?"
717,00:38:09.92,00:38:09.92,>> I think it should be... Brendan.
718,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,">> PROBST: Coach, you agree with that; Brendan's the guy that"
719,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,"should be leading this tribe? >> Being the devil's advocate,"
720,00:38:18.21,00:38:18.21,let's say Brendan is the leader; he has to take the
721,00:38:20.42,00:38:20.42,reins. I'm not suggesting that I'm the
722,00:38:22.96,00:38:22.96,"leader, but on the truck I was making eye contact with"
723,00:38:25.88,00:38:25.88,everybody and the reason why it worked so smoothly is because I
724,00:38:28.71,00:38:28.71,basically told everybody with my eyes to get what they needed
725,00:38:32.38,00:38:32.38,to get. >> PROBST: So it sounds like you
726,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,"should be leading. >> Well, absolutely, I would"
727,00:38:36.00,00:38:36.00,love to be leader. That's what I'm used to doing.
728,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,>> PROBST: Erinn you had about five different reactions.
729,00:38:40.08,00:38:40.08,Just share one with me. >> I think it's a role that
730,00:38:42.54,00:38:42.54,Coach is used to. It's a role that he would love
731,00:38:45.08,00:38:45.08,"to be in,  but it's something that Brendan does better."
732,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,">> PROBST: Coach? >> Again, I'm not criticizing"
733,00:38:51.25,00:38:51.25,"Brendan, but we've lost three challenges in a row and for her"
734,00:38:54.08,00:38:54.08,"to be so quick to say that, I think comes more to a"
735,00:38:56.75,00:38:56.75,personality clash between us two.
736,00:38:59.12,00:38:59.12,>> I didn't know we had a personality clash.
737,00:39:01.08,00:39:01.08,"You have these great ideas, but I don't ever see you saying"
738,00:39:05.42,00:39:05.42,"more than, ""Well, I have this idea, but you guys do whatever"
739,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,"you're going to do."" >> PROBST: So you're saying"
740,00:39:10.83,00:39:10.83,"he's a little passive-aggressive, throwing"
741,00:39:12.50,00:39:12.50,"throwing out an idea, but not owning it?"
742,00:39:14.21,00:39:14.21,">> Uh-huh. >> PROBST: Coach, is that hard"
743,00:39:16.46,00:39:16.46,to hear? 'Cause it sounds like what
744,00:39:18.46,00:39:18.46,you're struggling with a little bit is ego.
