381,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,">> Not true at all.>> That is not true, Jeff."
382,00:23:05.00,00:23:05.00,>> Not true at all.>> PROBST: You know what?
383,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83,"I'm sitting here asking her ifshe knows how to make fire,"
384,00:23:09.04,00:23:09.04,and you guys are making jokeslike you're at open mic.
385,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,"You tell me,what am I supposed to think?"
386,00:23:27.75,00:23:27.75,"Water starting to rise.Soon, you will run"
387,00:23:35.12,00:23:35.12,out of room completely.This challenge has been going
388,00:23:42.25,00:23:42.25,for about 40 minutes.This is where mind over matter
389,00:23:45.79,00:23:45.79,comes into play.The water's completely covering
390,00:23:58.79,00:23:58.79,everybody's ears.Now it's starting to creep up
391,00:24:03.42,00:24:03.42,toward the mouth and the eyes.Caryn opts out
392,00:24:12.71,00:24:12.71,of the competition.We are down to six.
393,00:24:20.08,00:24:20.08,Water really creeping uptoward the mouth and eyes now.
394,00:24:24.75,00:24:24.75,Jenn almost underwater.Steph partially underwater.
395,00:24:29.62,00:24:29.62,Ian struggling.Pushing his face
396,00:24:32.58,00:24:32.58,through that grate.Jenn is underwater.
397,00:24:43.46,00:24:43.46,Will she come back up?Katie's out of the competition.
398,00:24:51.29,00:24:51.29,Jenn still underwater.Steph goes underwater.
399,00:24:56.96,00:24:56.96,Both remaining women are runningout of breathing room.
400,00:25:01.62,00:25:01.62,Ian goes underwater.Jenn and Steph still underwater.
401,00:25:09.54,00:25:09.54,Ian's back up.Jenn is out of the competition.
402,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,Steph is out of the competition.We are down to three--
403,00:25:16.75,00:25:16.75,"Tom, Gregg and Ian.All five women are"
404,00:25:20.00,00:25:20.00,out of the competition.Immunity at stake.
405,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,"Water coming in over the eyes,into the mouth."
406,00:25:28.58,00:25:28.58,Gregg goes underwater.Gregg is out of the competition.
407,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,">> Good job, Gregg.>> PROBST: Tom trying to create"
408,00:25:36.88,00:25:36.88,a hand snorkel.Ian plugging his nose.
409,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,>> I can't believe they'restill up like that.
410,00:25:43.25,00:25:43.25,">> PROBST: Immunity at stake,safety at Tribal Council."
411,00:26:03.79,00:26:03.79,That's it!Tom wins immunity!
412,00:26:06.12,00:26:06.12,"( applause )>> Good job, Tom."
413,00:26:12.04,00:26:12.04,">> Good job, Tom.>> Was it me?"
414,00:26:14.42,00:26:14.42,">> Yep.>> PROBST: Okay, some business"
415,00:26:19.38,00:26:19.38,"to take care of.First of all, Janu,"
416,00:26:22.08,00:26:22.08,we're gonna bring your boat in.You will be taken
417,00:26:24.75,00:26:24.75,to a deserted island.You'll be left on your own
418,00:26:28.08,00:26:28.08,"with the materials you have.>> Be well, Janu."
419,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,"We'll see you tomorrow.>> Good luck, Janu."
420,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,">> Janu, good luck.>> PROBST: Tom... immunity--"
421,00:26:44.38,00:26:44.38,"come over and get it.Once again, you are safe"
422,00:26:50.29,00:26:50.29,from the vote at tomorrownight's Tribal Council.
423,00:26:54.17,00:26:54.17,"For the rest of you, includingJanu, somebody else is"
424,00:26:56.33,00:26:56.33,going to be voted out of thisgame; you'll become the second
425,00:26:59.08,00:26:59.08,member of the jury.Swim on back to your boat.
426,00:27:16.38,00:27:16.38,">> Right now, I amgoing to a different island,"
427,00:27:19.04,00:27:19.04,"all by myself,because I couldn't finish out"
428,00:27:21.67,00:27:21.67,the immunity challenge.I don't think that I'll be
429,00:27:36.21,00:27:36.21,scared as long as I have fire.I think if I am going to be
430,00:27:39.50,00:27:39.50,"in the dark,then I think I'll get"
431,00:27:42.08,00:27:42.08,"a little bit more scared.This is very hard,"
432,00:27:48.96,00:27:48.96,"and it's very frustrating,but I don't want to give up."
433,00:27:56.25,00:27:56.25,"I just feel very inadequate,'cause I see the fire come up"
434,00:28:00.08,00:28:00.08,and then... it goes away.And I try to put little
435,00:28:06.17,00:28:06.17,pieces... and it's not working.Ow!
436,00:28:24.25,00:28:24.25,"This is a challenge for me,but I needed time"
437,00:28:27.75,00:28:27.75,away from that camp.I'm not getting along well
438,00:28:30.12,00:28:30.12,"with anybody.I feel very much on my own,"
439,00:28:34.25,00:28:34.25,and... it is me against them.Woo!
440,00:28:49.25,00:28:49.25,"I've got fire.Yesterday, I didn't even"
441,00:28:55.17,00:28:55.17,"want to be here, but maybe Godwas just telling me,"
442,00:28:58.96,00:28:58.96,hold on a little bit morebecause this is the feeling
443,00:29:01.42,00:29:01.42,you are supposed to get.So who knows?
444,00:29:03.42,00:29:03.42,"Every day brings newexperiences, and right now,"
445,00:29:06.00,00:29:06.00,"I am probably the happiest thatI have been in these 26 days,"
446,00:29:11.54,00:29:11.54,'cause it's all about meand this little island.
447,00:29:15.46,00:29:15.46,It's mine.It's all mine.
448,00:29:26.50,00:29:26.50,"The moon, the stars,the water..."
449,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,and my fire.It's all mine!
450,00:29:55.92,00:29:55.92,>> The big decision that we'refacing right now is
451,00:29:59.21,00:29:59.21,"who's going home tonight?>> Who we, uh..."
452,00:30:02.42,00:30:02.42,Who we thinking today?And my thought with that is that
453,00:30:10.21,00:30:10.21,that's like an emotionalresponse because they get along
454,00:30:12.83,00:30:12.83,"with Stephenie, and Stepheniehas the ability to form"
455,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,some inside bonds early.No one's going to do that with
456,00:30:19.58,00:30:19.58,"Janu, and so I know I couldconvince Jenn that"
457,00:30:22.67,00:30:22.67,"Stephenie's the one.>> From day two, Katie, Ian,"
458,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,myself and Stephenie had alldecided that we'd try
459,00:30:29.71,00:30:29.71,"to run this as a final four,and we all agreed that"
460,00:30:32.67,00:30:32.67,"should we get splitinto different tribes,"
461,00:30:34.79,00:30:34.79,"every man for himself,but look out for each other"
462,00:30:37.21,00:30:37.21,when we do get back together.The problem with that right now
463,00:30:40.38,00:30:40.38,"is Jenn and Gregg,who have since joined Ian,"
464,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,"Katie, and I, and have becomefive, are adamant"
465,00:30:47.50,00:30:47.50,that Stephenie goes home.So at what point do we stop
466,00:30:55.21,00:30:55.21,"rewarding Janu with, um...>> We're the only ones here,"
467,00:30:59.00,00:30:59.00,right?>> Yeah.
468,00:31:01.42,00:31:01.42,>> Right.I still struggle with the
469,00:31:04.54,00:31:04.54,"question of why, why not now,if then, you know?"
470,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,"I mean, then why for the sameexact reason why wouldn't...?"
471,00:31:11.00,00:31:11.00,">> Well, I think Stephenieis a bigger threat than Janu."
472,00:31:15.88,00:31:15.88,>> And there's no way that Janusqueaks by in the end?
473,00:31:20.21,00:31:20.21,">> If she wants...I mean, she wants"
474,00:31:22.58,00:31:22.58,to go home so bad...>> Well...
475,00:31:25.25,00:31:25.25,we know they have to go.>> Mm-hmm.
476,00:31:27.29,00:31:27.29,>> That's true.I'd-I'd get concerned
477,00:31:29.58,00:31:29.58,"about the whole eleven TribalCouncils in a row, and"
478,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,Stephenie is still surviving.>> Mm-hmm.
479,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,>> I just feel likeit's a story developing
480,00:31:39.88,00:31:39.88,that we need to put an end to.Stephenie is a physical threat.
481,00:31:44.04,00:31:44.04,She's a competitor.She's got a strong will.
482,00:31:47.33,00:31:47.33,"She wants to win this game.There's other folks, like Janu,"
483,00:31:50.96,00:31:50.96,who don't want to win this gameas much as her.
484,00:31:53.17,00:31:53.17,"Stephenie's story has beencontinuing and continuing,"
485,00:31:56.88,00:31:56.88,so you can just see itall coming together.
486,00:31:58.92,00:31:58.92,"Stephenie conquers Ulong, thencomes in and conquers Koror,"
487,00:32:01.96,00:32:01.96,and we want to all preventthat from happening.
488,00:32:04.54,00:32:04.54,>> I love her to death.I'm really going to miss her.
489,00:32:08.12,00:32:08.12,But...>> Right.
490,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,">> Better now, than shegetting too comfortable."
491,00:32:13.58,00:32:13.58,>> Yeah.>> As things seem now
492,00:32:16.25,00:32:16.25,"within the tribe,Stephenie appears"
493,00:32:17.75,00:32:17.75,"to be going home tonight.So, it's not..."
494,00:32:20.54,00:32:20.54,"where my heart is,but anything can happen."
495,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,>> How you doing?>> Hey! How was it?
496,00:32:38.25,00:32:38.25,>> Did she say it was great?>> Yes.
497,00:32:41.12,00:32:41.12,">> Yeah, she said...>> Tell us about it."
498,00:32:44.04,00:32:44.04,Um... It took me about two anda half hours to make a fire.
499,00:32:47.33,00:32:47.33,>> You got it?>> You got fire?
500,00:32:49.79,00:32:49.79,>> You got fire.>> Good for you!
501,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,>> Good job.>> Three hours.
502,00:32:53.46,00:32:53.46,>> You did it. You did it.>> Do you feel better?
503,00:32:55.83,00:32:55.83,>> You seem likeyou feel better?
504,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,">> Better? Um...Yeah. It was, uh..."
505,00:32:59.33,00:32:59.33,full-circle for me.It was... it was great
506,00:33:01.21,00:33:01.21,"to be away from here, and itwas great to be on my own."
507,00:33:04.04,00:33:04.04,"And I just had time to be bymyself, and that was good."
508,00:33:06.54,00:33:06.54,>> Wow. That's amazing.>> Good job.
509,00:33:08.79,00:33:08.79,>> Good for you.> Congratulations.
510,00:33:10.75,00:33:10.75,">> Well done. Well done.>> To be honest, I didn't want"
511,00:33:13.54,00:33:13.54,"to come back here,and when I got here,"
512,00:33:15.96,00:33:15.96,"everybody was like,""Oh, that's great. Hey, good"
513,00:33:18.88,00:33:18.88,"job. Way to go.""The same people that were being"
514,00:33:21.62,00:33:21.62,rude and saying that Icreated animosity.
515,00:33:25.08,00:33:25.08,"Just... not... nice.>> I mean, we all agreed that it"
516,00:33:51.96,00:33:51.96,"was Janu tonight,and Janu wants it to be her,"
517,00:33:55.04,00:33:55.04,but for some reason I havea feeling it's me.
518,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,"Today, there was never a timewhen I could grab anybody alone"
519,00:34:02.08,00:34:02.08,and walk down the beach.>> We'll see.
520,00:34:05.79,00:34:05.79,">> Yeah, that's the plan.Who-- you?"
521,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,">> It almost seems like no onewants to talk about it,"
522,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,so I'm really nervous.>> PROBST: We'll now bring
523,00:34:44.33,00:34:44.33,"in the first member of the jury.Coby, voted out at the"
524,00:34:48.54,00:34:48.54,"last Tribal Council.Janu, let's talk"
525,00:34:56.58,00:34:56.58,about your night alone.You were abandoned
526,00:34:59.12,00:34:59.12,on a separate islandwith meager supplies.
527,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,>> Yup.>> PROBST: How'd you do?
528,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,">> I did great.I, um, finally got the fire"
529,00:35:07.42,00:35:07.42,"going, and then, um,did a little dance."
530,00:35:09.62,00:35:09.62,"It was really exciting.>> PROBST: Yeah, that..."
531,00:35:11.42,00:35:11.42,That had to be a-a bigaccomplishment for you.
532,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,">> It was a very bigaccomplishment, and I tried to"
533,00:35:17.12,00:35:17.12,"put myself to sleep, and inthe morning, the sun rose,"
534,00:35:20.12,00:35:20.12,and it was a whole new day.It was great.
535,00:35:24.92,00:35:24.92,">> PROBST: As you left in yourboat, everybody waved"
536,00:35:28.08,00:35:28.08,and said good luck.Did you buy it?
537,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,">> Um, honestly, Jeff,it-it was, um..."
538,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,No.I'm sure that half of it was
539,00:35:39.33,00:35:39.33,"sincere, but the other halfwas, as they call it, the game."
540,00:35:44.21,00:35:44.21,"And when I came home todayfrom the island, it..."
541,00:35:46.96,00:35:46.96,it just felt really strange.It felt like I didn't belong.
542,00:35:49.17,00:35:49.17,">> PROBST: Caryn, you look likeyou're counting"
543,00:35:51.71,00:35:51.71,to ten over there.I'm just shocked.
544,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,"You know, if that's the wayshe chooses to take it,"
545,00:35:56.75,00:35:56.75,that's-that's...that's in Janu's head.
546,00:36:00.12,00:36:00.12,">> PROBST: Tom, at this pointin the game, is it worth"

549,00:36:11.17,00:36:11.17,gamesmanship now.Nobody is voting
550,00:36:14.29,00:36:14.29,"based on, uh, who they likeor who makes me laugh."
551,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,"The game is on, and peopleare basing their votes"
552,00:36:22.04,00:36:22.04,on how it positions themin the game.
553,00:36:24.71,00:36:24.71,And eliminating competitionis part of this game.

559,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,than you would someone whois giving five million percent.
560,00:36:47.29,00:36:47.29,"And some plans have beenestablished, and some"

568,00:37:14.62,00:37:14.62,>> No reason.They can get rid of me.
569,00:37:20.17,00:37:20.17,>> PROBST: There's no reasonthey should keep you?
570,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,">> No, because, I mean,I have to be honest."
571,00:37:26.04,00:37:26.04,"I had a really rocky road so,if I was them, God, I'd be sick"
572,00:37:31.04,00:37:31.04,of myself already.>> PROBST: You almost seem like
573,00:37:34.62,00:37:34.62,"you want to go home.>> It doesn't matter, Jeff."
574,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"Whatever happens, happens.I'm... I'm completely satisfied."
575,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,">> PROBST: Is there a part ofyou that wants to say ""Vote me"
576,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,"out""?>> Yes. Absolutely."
577,00:37:48.04,00:37:48.04,But I don't know what they'lldo.
578,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,">> PROBST: Ian, why keepsomebody who's saying, ""I want"
579,00:37:53.38,00:37:53.38,"out of this game.I'm not going back to camp""?"
580,00:37:56.25,00:37:56.25,">> Well, if you feellike you don't want"
581,00:37:58.46,00:37:58.46,"to continue in this game--if you feel like, you know, you"
582,00:38:01.21,00:38:01.21,want to set your torch down--then you have the
583,00:38:03.46,00:38:03.46,power to do that.You have the ability and the
584,00:38:05.75,00:38:05.75,"power to set your torch down atany time, and there's nobody"
585,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,"keeping you here.>> PROBST: Stephenie, if looks"
586,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,"could kill, Janu would be on theground."
587,00:38:13.96,00:38:13.96,>> It's just... it's just...it's nothing against Janu.
588,00:38:16.67,00:38:16.67,This... It... it kills me.I can't even...
589,00:38:19.92,00:38:19.92,"Someone who I feel, like,could care less"
590,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,if they're even here.( crying )
591,00:38:27.08,00:38:27.08,"And here I am, like...I'd kill to be here."
592,00:38:33.25,00:38:33.25,">> Yeah, but... what you needto understand from my point is"
593,00:38:37.79,00:38:37.79,that I already received what Ineeded to receive
594,00:38:40.25,00:38:40.25,from this whole experience.>> And you're fine with that.
595,00:38:42.17,00:38:42.17,>> Yes.>> You could care less if you
596,00:38:44.25,00:38:44.25,"leave right now, right?>> Yes. That's... that's"
597,00:38:46.46,00:38:46.46,correct.>> I care. I...
598,00:38:48.54,00:38:48.54,"I'm not done playingthis game and, like,"
599,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,"if someone asked me tovote them out, see ya, because"
600,00:38:53.79,00:38:53.79,you don't deserve to be here.( sniffles )
601,00:38:56.50,00:38:56.50,And I'm...>> PROBST: So you feel you're
602,00:39:01.92,00:39:01.92,on the hot seat tonight?>> I know I am.
603,00:39:10.00,00:39:10.00,It's just... it's not that.It just... it kills me
604,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,"that someone who wantsto basically go home that bad,"
605,00:39:17.96,00:39:17.96,these people will keep aroundjust because...
606,00:39:21.67,00:39:21.67,I don't know why.I guess I showed too much heart
607,00:39:25.08,00:39:25.08,"and too much will.>> PROBST: Tom, in your"
608,00:39:28.38,00:39:28.38,"profession, unity, camaraderie--big part of it."
609,00:39:34.25,00:39:34.25,"When you hear somebody like thatlaying it out, and you have"
610,00:39:37.62,00:39:37.62,"somebody next to themwho's saying,"
611,00:39:40.46,00:39:40.46,"""Please get rid of me,""is there a dilemma for you?"
612,00:39:44.21,00:39:44.21,>> There is a dilemma.Um... Stephenie would fit into
613,00:39:47.62,00:39:47.62,"a 108 truck in a moment, and,uh, everybody in the company"
614,00:39:51.50,00:39:51.50,"would be proud to work with her.And it's... it's not work,"
615,00:39:54.33,00:39:54.33,and it's not camaraderie.It's Survivor.
616,00:39:58.12,00:39:58.12,So there's a hugedifference here.
617,00:40:02.04,00:40:02.04,">> PROBST: Janu, if you had yourway, what would happen tonight?"
618,00:40:06.29,00:40:06.29,>> I would ask the tribe to voteme out and keep Stephenie in.
619,00:40:09.25,00:40:09.25,>> PROBST: What's the differencebetween you
620,00:40:12.83,00:40:12.83,"laying your torch down,and you looking to this group"
621,00:40:15.29,00:40:15.29,"and saying, ""Vote me out""?>> I guess, after reflecting,"
622,00:40:21.29,00:40:21.29,"and, um, understanding this,there would be no difference."
623,00:40:25.75,00:40:25.75,So I would be willing to laydown my torch so that Stephenie
624,00:40:29.42,00:40:29.42,can have a chanceto stay in the game.
625,00:40:36.21,00:40:36.21,>> Not just for me.If she wants to lay down her
626,00:40:39.75,00:40:39.75,"torch and she wants to quit thisgame, she can do it, but..."
627,00:40:43.21,00:40:43.21,not on my account.>> Do you want me to rephrase
628,00:40:45.33,00:40:45.33,it?What I am saying
629,00:40:47.38,00:40:47.38,"is, I will lay down my torch,and I don't want Stephenie"
630,00:40:50.50,00:40:50.50,to feel that I am doingit for her.
631,00:40:53.08,00:40:53.08,That's somethingthat I have to do.
632,00:40:55.33,00:40:55.33,>> PROBST: I just wantto be clear.
633,00:40:57.54,00:40:57.54,"You are, on your own,quitting this game?"
634,00:41:01.08,00:41:01.08,">> Yes, Jeff.I will lay down"
635,00:41:03.25,00:41:03.25,"my torch this evening.>> PROBST: Well, I don't"
636,00:41:07.04,00:41:07.04,know if it's appropriate.We have rain coming down.
637,00:41:10.29,00:41:10.29,Maybe this is your finalepiphany or cleansing moment.
638,00:41:12.71,00:41:12.71,I see that you broughtall your belongings.
639,00:41:15.12,00:41:15.12,"Go ahead and gather them,bring your torch over."
640,00:41:27.58,00:41:27.58,"Janu, per your wishes, this gameis over for you, but you will"
641,00:41:30.21,00:41:30.21,not go home.You'll return and be a part
642,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,"of our jury.Thank you, Jeff."
643,00:41:36.00,00:41:36.00,>> PROBST: Good night.Another strange turn of events
644,00:41:53.38,00:41:53.38,"at Tribal Council.Steph, you've hung in there"
645,00:41:55.54,00:41:55.54,"for a long time, overcomea lot of odds."
646,00:41:58.12,00:41:58.12,You escaped another one tonight.Sounds like you have your work
647,00:42:01.25,00:42:01.25,"cut out for you.Grab your torches, guys."
648,00:42:03.21,00:42:03.21,Head back to camp.Good night.
649,00:42:19.75,00:42:19.75,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenesfrom our next episode.
650,00:42:24.33,00:42:24.33,>> PROBST: Next time onSurvivor:
651,00:42:26.25,00:42:26.25,>> Tom might haveto be the next to go.
652,00:42:28.17,00:42:28.17,>> PROBST: Stephenie steps upher game.
653,00:42:30.21,00:42:30.21,">> I'll do it,if you guys are game."
654,00:42:32.42,00:42:32.42,>> PROBST: And one of the mencould take the fall.
655,00:42:36.12,00:42:36.12,">> We didn't vote Stephenie outwhen we should have, which is"
656,00:42:38.54,00:42:38.54,the first round.You want to think I'm a threat?
657,00:42:42.21,00:42:42.21,I'll show youhow threatening I am.
658,00:42:49.79,00:42:49.79,">> I asked them to please let mego home, and it didn't work,"
659,00:42:53.08,00:42:53.08,"so I made the last move,and I decided to take myself"
660,00:42:56.04,00:42:56.04,out of the game.I guess I did make
661,00:42:58.96,00:42:58.96,"a major power play, and I guessI did ruin their plans."
662,00:43:02.00,00:43:02.00,"Even though I laid down mytorch, no one will ever be able"
663,00:43:05.04,00:43:05.04,to take away this mostunforgettable experience.
664,00:43:07.38,00:43:07.38,No one.
