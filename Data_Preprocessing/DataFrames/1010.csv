56,00:04:06.50,00:04:06.50,I felt betrayed. Nobody had informed me

58,00:04:11.17,00:04:11.17,at summer camp? We're on Survivor.

65,00:04:25.00,00:04:25.00,"She's a crazy person. Last night at Tribal Council,"
66,00:04:28.58,00:04:28.58,she was sitting like a jack-in-the-box
67,00:04:30.96,00:04:30.96,with this really creepy smile and eyes on her face.
68,00:04:33.12,00:04:33.12,She was just so excited. >> She was excited.
69,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,She thought she was going. >> It was scary.
70,00:04:37.12,00:04:37.12,I don't like it at all. It freaked me out.
71,00:04:39.42,00:04:39.42,It was like a clown. >> Katie started...
72,00:04:42.00,00:04:42.00,"she was gossiping about Janu. She was saying,"
73,00:04:45.88,00:04:45.88,"""Ooh, Janu is giving looks. Janu is making faces."""
74,00:04:48.21,00:04:48.21,"And... Janu overheard it. >> What are we,"
75,00:04:51.46,00:04:51.46,"junior high, Katie? We pretend"
76,00:04:53.54,00:04:53.54,we're all good friends? It's-It's silly.
77,00:04:55.67,00:04:55.67,Do you understand what I mean? I have nothing against you
78,00:04:58.04,00:04:58.04,"personally, 'cause I don't know you."
79,00:04:59.83,00:04:59.83,>> I have nothing against you. >> But you're being...
80,00:05:01.92,00:05:01.92,>> You're being creepy. I'm sorry.
81,00:05:03.67,00:05:03.67,">> Well, then why don't you tell me to my face?"
82,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,Why do you have to go to your little friends and tell them?
83,00:05:08.04,00:05:08.04,That's what I don't understand. >> I'm sorry. I...
84,00:05:10.08,00:05:10.08,">> No, you don't have to be... you don't have to be sorry."
85,00:05:12.25,00:05:12.25,>> I'm telling you that I am. >> That's who you are.
86,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,>> I apologize. That wasn't fair.
87,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17,>> I'm not used to playing games.
88,00:05:18.25,00:05:18.25,"If I had something to say about you, I swear to God, I would"
89,00:05:21.25,00:05:21.25,come up and say it to your face. Why do I have to go to...?

92,00:05:28.42,00:05:28.42,comedian-to-be? >> She just talks in these
93,00:05:30.25,00:05:30.25,"circles and doesn't make any sense, and then she's like,"
94,00:05:32.25,00:05:32.25,"and, you know, ""Katie, then you're making fun of me,"""
95,00:05:34.38,00:05:34.38,"and she does the face again, which is even more scary"
96,00:05:36.58,00:05:36.58,when she's impersonating herself being impersonated.
97,00:05:38.33,00:05:38.33,">> I am very upset. >> Okay, I apologized, Janu."
98,00:05:40.42,00:05:40.42,"So if you can't get over that, then that's..."
99,00:05:43.12,00:05:43.12,>> It doesn't matter if I can or not.
100,00:05:44.88,00:05:44.88,You're done. You're done with
101,00:05:46.58,00:05:46.58,the conversation. >> I-I just don't want
102,00:05:48.25,00:05:48.25,"it to turn into, like, you know... you're"
103,00:05:50.42,00:05:50.42,"off in a corner, because... >> It's going to turn into"
104,00:05:52.96,00:05:52.96,"whatever it's going to turn into, 'cause all you guys are"
105,00:05:55.67,00:05:55.67,going to turn on each other. It's fine.
106,00:06:00.42,00:06:00.42,>> Janu is turning it into just something that we need to
107,00:06:03.33,00:06:03.33,kind of put up with out here. It's kind of a buzz kill
108,00:06:06.50,00:06:06.50,"to have her around. It's unfortunate, but..."
109,00:06:08.67,00:06:08.67,what are you going to do? I'm not going to vote someone
110,00:06:14.04,00:06:14.04,out because I don't like them. I can get over it.
111,00:06:16.79,00:06:16.79,"She plays a bigger role in all of our strategies,"
112,00:06:21.17,00:06:21.17,where Stephenie only threatens it.
113,00:06:24.08,00:06:24.08,"Some may think that Stephenie deserves to stay around, but in"
114,00:06:27.58,00:06:27.58,"the grand scheme of things, winning this game"
115,00:06:30.29,00:06:30.29,is hardly about deserving. I don't care if someone
116,00:06:32.58,00:06:32.58,deserves to be here or not. If you have a role
117,00:06:35.17,00:06:35.17,"in my strategy, then you deserve to be here"
118,00:06:37.33,00:06:37.33,so you can help me win a million dollars.
119,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,>> PROBST: Ready for today's reward challenge?
120,00:06:58.25,00:06:58.25,">> Mm-hmm. Yes. >> PROBST: Okay, for today's"

122,00:07:03.50,00:07:03.50,Here's how it will work: We will randomly divide
123,00:07:06.17,00:07:06.17,"into two tribes of four. Using a buoy for assistance,"
124,00:07:10.08,00:07:10.08,you will transport the six pieces of scaffolding
125,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,"one at a time into the water, and construct your tower."
126,00:07:16.08,00:07:16.08,"Once you've built the tower and it's secure,"
127,00:07:18.25,00:07:18.25,"one tribe member will climb to the top, grab the small flag,"
128,00:07:21.08,00:07:21.08,and race back to the beach. First tribe of four
129,00:07:23.67,00:07:23.67,to get back to the map with their flag wins reward.
130,00:07:26.08,00:07:26.08,Want to know what you're playing for?
131,00:07:28.04,00:07:28.04,( Survivors murmuring ) The winning foursome

136,00:07:42.00,00:07:42.00,"to work out tribal politics. You will drink local beer,"
137,00:07:44.96,00:07:44.96,you will also have food and dessert.
138,00:07:47.38,00:07:47.38,Make sense? >> Yes.

259,00:16:04.21,00:16:04.21,to get up and excuse myself. I thought I was going to have
260,00:16:07.88,00:16:07.88,an embolism. ( retching )
261,00:16:16.42,00:16:16.42,">> Yup, she is. >> Thank you."

266,00:16:28.25,00:16:28.25,"that would have enjoyed it a ton, but unfortunately,"
267,00:16:31.42,00:16:31.42,Janu just couldn't handle the entire thing.

271,00:16:53.04,00:16:53.04,"Well, I'll tell you what we got. They rolled out,"
272,00:16:55.29,00:16:55.29,"I mean, we had a fish. It was a regular salad."
273,00:16:58.08,00:16:58.08,>> What kind of dressing? >> Squeezed lime on it.

279,00:17:12.38,00:17:12.38,"and Gregg says, ""Okay, don't finish your stew."
280,00:17:15.00,00:17:15.00,"Don't eat another bite."" Don't, uh... don't fill"
281,00:17:17.21,00:17:17.21,yourselves up too much. Don't full yourselves
282,00:17:19.42,00:17:19.42,up too much. >> Why?
283,00:17:21.29,00:17:21.29,>> 'Cause we brought some back for you.
284,00:17:23.21,00:17:23.21,">> No, you didn't. >> You did not!"
285,00:17:25.04,00:17:25.04,"( screaming, laughing ) >> What is that?"

300,00:17:58.42,00:17:58.42,and reaches out and takes some of the food.
301,00:18:01.00,00:18:01.00,">> It came out in this, like... >> I thought it was interesting"
302,00:18:03.83,00:18:03.83,"that Janu decided to say, ""Oh, you know, I didn't get"

305,00:18:09.79,00:18:09.79,"in there, and ate our dessert. Actually, Caryn did it, too."
306,00:18:14.04,00:18:14.04,"But, you know, what are we going to say?"
307,00:18:17.21,00:18:17.21,"""Get your hands off something that you brought us?"""

321,00:19:07.38,00:19:07.38,"because apparently I'm the ""strongest"" girl,"
322,00:19:11.25,00:19:11.25,and I'm just as much of a threat as any of the guys.
323,00:19:17.25,00:19:17.25,"But we'll see, I mean, I'm doing the best I can out"
324,00:19:19.62,00:19:19.62,"here, and I just hope that I can get immunity."

329,00:19:50.71,00:19:50.71,Today's immunity challenge is going to test your ability
330,00:19:54.08,00:19:54.08,to remain calm and not panic when everything else
331,00:19:58.21,00:19:58.21,in your body says otherwise. You all take a spot in the
332,00:20:00.79,00:20:00.79,"water, underneath a grated steel barrier."
333,00:20:04.62,00:20:04.62,"As the tide begins to rise, the water will rise,"
334,00:20:09.04,00:20:09.04,and your breathing room will slowly decrease
335,00:20:12.50,00:20:12.50,until you run out of breathing room.
336,00:20:15.79,00:20:15.79,The person who stays in this challenge the longest
337,00:20:17.79,00:20:17.79,"wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-seven shot"
338,00:20:21.50,00:20:21.50,at a million bucks and the title of sole survivor.
339,00:20:24.21,00:20:24.21,One more thing: Today's challenge also reveals
340,00:20:26.67,00:20:26.67,how you handle fear. The first person to bail
341,00:20:31.08,00:20:31.08,on this challenge will face the ultimate
342,00:20:33.25,00:20:33.25,test of fear: You'll be taken to a new beach
343,00:20:36.62,00:20:36.62,and abandoned there tonight to live on your own.
344,00:20:45.04,00:20:45.04,"You'll have flint and steel, you'll have a machete, you'll"
345,00:20:47.38,00:20:47.38,"have a jerry can full of water, and you'll have some"
346,00:20:50.04,00:20:50.04,fishing gear. So if you've learned anything
347,00:20:52.21,00:20:52.21,"in your first 26 days out here, you should be fine."
348,00:20:54.88,00:20:54.88,"If not, it's going to be a miserable night."
349,00:20:57.08,00:20:57.08,Make sense? Take a spot out in the water.
350,00:21:00.21,00:21:00.21,We'll get started. >> Here we go.
351,00:21:13.75,00:21:13.75,Survivors ready? Begin.
352,00:21:24.71,00:21:24.71,>> This man walks into a bar. ( laughs )
353,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,>> He's got a bar in one hand and a bar in the other.
354,00:21:30.29,00:21:30.29,"( laughter ) >> PROBST: First person out,"
355,00:21:33.46,00:21:33.46,"leaving here on a boat, taken to an island,"

362,00:21:50.96,00:21:50.96,all right on your own? >> I think it'd be
363,00:21:53.12,00:21:53.12,"kind of tough, actually. >> PROBST: How about you, Janu?"
364,00:21:56.42,00:21:56.42,">> I would try my best. I don't, I'm already"
365,00:21:58.92,00:21:58.92,"getting cold in here, so I don't know how long..."
366,00:22:01.04,00:22:01.04,"What's gonna be worse? >> PROBST: Which would be worse,"
367,00:22:05.42,00:22:05.42,hanging in that water cold or being left alone tonight?
368,00:22:08.79,00:22:08.79,>> Probably hanging in this water cold right now.

370,00:22:14.21,00:22:14.21,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Just like that,"

372,00:22:26.12,00:22:26.12,"What just happened, Janu? Was it me saying"
373,00:22:28.83,00:22:28.83,"the word ""panic""? Janu... how are you at fire?"
374,00:22:41.12,00:22:41.12,">> Uh, I don't know. I'll find out tonight."
375,00:22:43.21,00:22:43.21,>> PROBST: Have you made fire yet?

380,00:22:59.67,00:22:59.67,guys. They don't seem too concerned
381,00:23:01.54,00:23:01.54,about you tonight. >> That's not true.
382,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,">> Not true at all. >> That is not true, Jeff."
383,00:23:05.00,00:23:05.00,>> Not true at all. >> PROBST: You know what?
384,00:23:06.83,00:23:06.83,"I'm sitting here asking her if she knows how to make fire,"
385,00:23:09.04,00:23:09.04,and you guys are making jokes like you're at open mic.
386,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,"You tell me, what am I supposed to think?"
387,00:23:27.75,00:23:27.75,"Water starting to rise. Soon, you will run"
388,00:23:35.12,00:23:35.12,out of room completely. This challenge has been going
389,00:23:42.25,00:23:42.25,for about 40 minutes. This is where mind over matter
390,00:23:45.79,00:23:45.79,comes into play. The water's completely covering
391,00:23:58.79,00:23:58.79,everybody's ears. Now it's starting to creep up
392,00:24:03.42,00:24:03.42,toward the mouth and the eyes. Caryn opts out
393,00:24:12.71,00:24:12.71,of the competition. We are down to six.
394,00:24:20.08,00:24:20.08,Water really creeping up toward the mouth and eyes now.
395,00:24:24.75,00:24:24.75,Jenn almost underwater. Steph partially underwater.
396,00:24:29.62,00:24:29.62,Ian struggling. Pushing his face
397,00:24:32.58,00:24:32.58,through that grate. Jenn is underwater.
398,00:24:43.46,00:24:43.46,Will she come back up? Katie's out of the competition.
399,00:24:51.29,00:24:51.29,Jenn still underwater. Steph goes underwater.
400,00:24:56.96,00:24:56.96,Both remaining women are running out of breathing room.
401,00:25:01.62,00:25:01.62,Ian goes underwater. Jenn and Steph still underwater.
402,00:25:09.54,00:25:09.54,Ian's back up. Jenn is out of the competition.
403,00:25:14.08,00:25:14.08,Steph is out of the competition. We are down to three--
404,00:25:16.75,00:25:16.75,"Tom, Gregg and Ian. All five women are"
405,00:25:20.00,00:25:20.00,out of the competition. Immunity at stake.
406,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,"Water coming in over the eyes, into the mouth."
407,00:25:28.58,00:25:28.58,Gregg goes underwater. Gregg is out of the competition.
408,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,">> Good job, Gregg. >> PROBST: Tom trying to create"
409,00:25:36.88,00:25:36.88,a hand snorkel. Ian plugging his nose.
410,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,>> I can't believe they're still up like that.
411,00:25:43.25,00:25:43.25,">> PROBST: Immunity at stake, safety at Tribal Council."
412,00:26:03.79,00:26:03.79,That's it! Tom wins immunity!
413,00:26:06.12,00:26:06.12,"( applause ) >> Good job, Tom."
414,00:26:12.04,00:26:12.04,">> Good job, Tom. >> Was it me?"
415,00:26:14.42,00:26:14.42,">> Yep. >> PROBST: Okay, some business"
416,00:26:19.38,00:26:19.38,"to take care of. First of all, Janu,"
417,00:26:22.08,00:26:22.08,we're gonna bring your boat in. You will be taken
418,00:26:24.75,00:26:24.75,to a deserted island. You'll be left on your own
419,00:26:28.08,00:26:28.08,"with the materials you have. >> Be well, Janu."
420,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,"We'll see you tomorrow. >> Good luck, Janu."
421,00:26:36.25,00:26:36.25,">> Janu, good luck. >> PROBST: Tom... immunity--"
422,00:26:44.38,00:26:44.38,"come over and get it. Once again, you are safe"
423,00:26:50.29,00:26:50.29,from the vote at tomorrow night's Tribal Council.
424,00:26:54.17,00:26:54.17,"For the rest of you, including Janu, somebody else is"
425,00:26:56.33,00:26:56.33,going to be voted out of this game; you'll become the second
426,00:26:59.08,00:26:59.08,member of the jury. Swim on back to your boat.
427,00:27:16.38,00:27:16.38,">> Right now, I am going to a different island,"
428,00:27:19.04,00:27:19.04,"all by myself, because I couldn't finish out"
429,00:27:21.67,00:27:21.67,the immunity challenge. I don't think that I'll be
430,00:27:36.21,00:27:36.21,scared as long as I have fire. I think if I am going to be
431,00:27:39.50,00:27:39.50,"in the dark, then I think I'll get"
432,00:27:42.08,00:27:42.08,"a little bit more scared. This is very hard,"
433,00:27:48.96,00:27:48.96,"and it's very frustrating, but I don't want to give up."
434,00:27:56.25,00:27:56.25,"I just feel very inadequate, 'cause I see the fire come up"
435,00:28:00.08,00:28:00.08,and then... it goes away. And I try to put little
436,00:28:06.17,00:28:06.17,pieces... and it's not working. Ow!
437,00:28:24.25,00:28:24.25,"This is a challenge for me, but I needed time"
438,00:28:27.75,00:28:27.75,away from that camp. I'm not getting along well
439,00:28:30.12,00:28:30.12,"with anybody. I feel very much on my own,"
440,00:28:34.25,00:28:34.25,and... it is me against them. Woo!
441,00:28:49.25,00:28:49.25,"I've got fire. Yesterday, I didn't even"
442,00:28:55.17,00:28:55.17,"want to be here, but maybe God was just telling me,"
443,00:28:58.96,00:28:58.96,hold on a little bit more because this is the feeling
444,00:29:01.42,00:29:01.42,you are supposed to get. So who knows?
445,00:29:03.42,00:29:03.42,"Every day brings new experiences, and right now,"
446,00:29:06.00,00:29:06.00,"I am probably the happiest that I have been in these 26 days,"
447,00:29:11.54,00:29:11.54,'cause it's all about me and this little island.
448,00:29:15.46,00:29:15.46,It's mine. It's all mine.
449,00:29:26.50,00:29:26.50,"The moon, the stars, the water..."
450,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,and my fire. It's all mine!
451,00:29:55.92,00:29:55.92,>> The big decision that we're facing right now is
452,00:29:59.21,00:29:59.21,"who's going home tonight? >> Who we, uh..."
453,00:30:02.42,00:30:02.42,Who we thinking today? And my thought with that is that
454,00:30:10.21,00:30:10.21,that's like an emotional response because they get along
455,00:30:12.83,00:30:12.83,"with Stephenie, and Stephenie has the ability to form"
456,00:30:16.00,00:30:16.00,some inside bonds early. No one's going to do that with
457,00:30:19.58,00:30:19.58,"Janu, and so I know I could convince Jenn that"
458,00:30:22.67,00:30:22.67,"Stephenie's the one. >> From day two, Katie, Ian,"
459,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,myself and Stephenie had all decided that we'd try
460,00:30:29.71,00:30:29.71,"to run this as a final four, and we all agreed that"
461,00:30:32.67,00:30:32.67,"should we get split into different tribes,"
462,00:30:34.79,00:30:34.79,"every man for himself, but look out for each other"
463,00:30:37.21,00:30:37.21,when we do get back together. The problem with that right now
464,00:30:40.38,00:30:40.38,"is Jenn and Gregg, who have since joined Ian,"
465,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,"Katie, and I, and have become five, are adamant"
466,00:30:47.50,00:30:47.50,that Stephenie goes home. So at what point do we stop
467,00:30:55.21,00:30:55.21,"rewarding Janu with, um... >> We're the only ones here,"
468,00:30:59.00,00:30:59.00,right? >> Yeah.
469,00:31:01.42,00:31:01.42,>> Right. I still struggle with the
470,00:31:04.54,00:31:04.54,"question of why, why not now, if then, you know?"
471,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,"I mean, then why for the same exact reason why wouldn't...?"
472,00:31:11.00,00:31:11.00,">> Well, I think Stephenie is a bigger threat than Janu."
473,00:31:15.88,00:31:15.88,>> And there's no way that Janu squeaks by in the end?
474,00:31:20.21,00:31:20.21,">> If she wants... I mean, she wants"
475,00:31:22.58,00:31:22.58,to go home so bad... >> Well...
476,00:31:25.25,00:31:25.25,we know they have to go. >> Mm-hmm.
477,00:31:27.29,00:31:27.29,>> That's true. I'd-I'd get concerned
478,00:31:29.58,00:31:29.58,"about the whole eleven Tribal Councils in a row, and"
479,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,Stephenie is still surviving. >> Mm-hmm.
480,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,>> I just feel like it's a story developing
481,00:31:39.88,00:31:39.88,that we need to put an end to. Stephenie is a physical threat.
482,00:31:44.04,00:31:44.04,She's a competitor. She's got a strong will.
483,00:31:47.33,00:31:47.33,"She wants to win this game. There's other folks, like Janu,"
484,00:31:50.96,00:31:50.96,who don't want to win this game as much as her.
485,00:31:53.17,00:31:53.17,"Stephenie's story has been continuing and continuing,"
486,00:31:56.88,00:31:56.88,so you can just see it all coming together.
487,00:31:58.92,00:31:58.92,"Stephenie conquers Ulong, then comes in and conquers Koror,"
488,00:32:01.96,00:32:01.96,and we want to all prevent that from happening.
489,00:32:04.54,00:32:04.54,>> I love her to death. I'm really going to miss her.
490,00:32:08.12,00:32:08.12,But... >> Right.
491,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,">> Better now, than she getting too comfortable."
492,00:32:13.58,00:32:13.58,>> Yeah. >> As things seem now
493,00:32:16.25,00:32:16.25,"within the tribe, Stephenie appears"
494,00:32:17.75,00:32:17.75,"to be going home tonight. So, it's not..."
495,00:32:20.54,00:32:20.54,"where my heart is, but anything can happen."
496,00:32:35.21,00:32:35.21,>> How you doing? >> Hey! How was it?
497,00:32:38.25,00:32:38.25,>> Did she say it was great? >> Yes.
498,00:32:41.12,00:32:41.12,">> Yeah, she said... >> Tell us about it."
499,00:32:44.04,00:32:44.04,Um... It took me about two and a half hours to make a fire.
500,00:32:47.33,00:32:47.33,>> You got it? >> You got fire?
501,00:32:49.79,00:32:49.79,>> You got fire. >> Good for you!
502,00:32:51.58,00:32:51.58,>> Good job. >> Three hours.
503,00:32:53.46,00:32:53.46,>> You did it. You did it. >> Do you feel better?
504,00:32:55.83,00:32:55.83,>> You seem like you feel better?
505,00:32:57.50,00:32:57.50,">> Better? Um... Yeah. It was, uh..."
506,00:32:59.33,00:32:59.33,full-circle for me. It was... it was great
507,00:33:01.21,00:33:01.21,"to be away from here, and it was great to be on my own."
508,00:33:04.04,00:33:04.04,"And I just had time to be by myself, and that was good."
509,00:33:06.54,00:33:06.54,>> Wow. That's amazing. >> Good job.
510,00:33:08.79,00:33:08.79,>> Good for you. > Congratulations.
511,00:33:10.75,00:33:10.75,">> Well done. Well done. >> To be honest, I didn't want"
512,00:33:13.54,00:33:13.54,"to come back here, and when I got here,"
513,00:33:15.96,00:33:15.96,"everybody was like, ""Oh, that's great. Hey, good"
514,00:33:18.88,00:33:18.88,"job. Way to go."" The same people that were being"
515,00:33:21.62,00:33:21.62,rude and saying that I created animosity.
516,00:33:25.08,00:33:25.08,"Just... not... nice. >> I mean, we all agreed that it"
517,00:33:51.96,00:33:51.96,"was Janu tonight, and Janu wants it to be her,"
518,00:33:55.04,00:33:55.04,but for some reason I have a feeling it's me.
519,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,"Today, there was never a time when I could grab anybody alone"
520,00:34:02.08,00:34:02.08,and walk down the beach. >> We'll see.
521,00:34:05.79,00:34:05.79,">> Yeah, that's the plan. Who-- you?"
522,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,">> It almost seems like no one wants to talk about it,"
523,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,so I'm really nervous. >> PROBST: We'll now bring
524,00:34:44.33,00:34:44.33,"in the first member of the jury. Coby, voted out at the"
525,00:34:48.54,00:34:48.54,"last Tribal Council. Janu, let's talk"
526,00:34:56.58,00:34:56.58,about your night alone. You were abandoned
527,00:34:59.12,00:34:59.12,on a separate island with meager supplies.
528,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,>> Yup. >> PROBST: How'd you do?
529,00:35:03.83,00:35:03.83,">> I did great. I, um, finally got the fire"
530,00:35:07.42,00:35:07.42,"going, and then, um, did a little dance."
531,00:35:09.62,00:35:09.62,"It was really exciting. >> PROBST: Yeah, that..."
532,00:35:11.42,00:35:11.42,That had to be a-a big accomplishment for you.
533,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,">> It was a very big accomplishment, and I tried to"
534,00:35:17.12,00:35:17.12,"put myself to sleep, and in the morning, the sun rose,"
535,00:35:20.12,00:35:20.12,and it was a whole new day. It was great.
536,00:35:24.92,00:35:24.92,">> PROBST: As you left in your boat, everybody waved"
537,00:35:28.08,00:35:28.08,and said good luck. Did you buy it?
538,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,">> Um, honestly, Jeff, it-it was, um..."
539,00:35:36.12,00:35:36.12,No. I'm sure that half of it was
540,00:35:39.33,00:35:39.33,"sincere, but the other half was, as they call it, the game."
541,00:35:44.21,00:35:44.21,"And when I came home today from the island, it..."
542,00:35:46.96,00:35:46.96,it just felt really strange. It felt like I didn't belong.
543,00:35:49.17,00:35:49.17,">> PROBST: Caryn, you look like you're counting"
544,00:35:51.71,00:35:51.71,to ten over there. I'm just shocked.
545,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,"You know, if that's the way she chooses to take it,"
546,00:35:56.75,00:35:56.75,that's-that's... that's in Janu's head.
547,00:36:00.12,00:36:00.12,">> PROBST: Tom, at this point in the game, is it worth"
548,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00,"versus threat-- who deserves to stay in this game,"
549,00:36:08.75,00:36:08.75,"versus who can't I beat? >> Yeah, well, it's all"
550,00:36:11.17,00:36:11.17,gamesmanship now. Nobody is voting
551,00:36:14.29,00:36:14.29,"based on, uh, who they like or who makes me laugh."
552,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,"The game is on, and people are basing their votes"
553,00:36:22.04,00:36:22.04,on how it positions them in the game.
554,00:36:24.71,00:36:24.71,And eliminating competition is part of this game.
555,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,">> PROBST: Gregg, same question. >> It's... it's not a question"
556,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,"of worthiness, and I think threat, you know?"
557,00:36:36.29,00:36:36.29,Everyone that wants to win the $1 million here
558,00:36:38.54,00:36:38.54,"is a threat to me. I mean, you definitely want"
559,00:36:41.21,00:36:41.21,someone in the game who is not going to really try
560,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,than you would someone who is giving five million percent.
561,00:36:47.29,00:36:47.29,"And some plans have been established, and some"
562,00:36:50.08,00:36:50.08,people may be threats within those plans.
563,00:36:53.38,00:36:53.38,"Unfortunately, you know, Survivor isn't"
564,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,always about fairness and who deserves what.
565,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,">> PROBST: Katie, why keep you? >> Why keep me?"
566,00:37:01.54,00:37:01.54,">> PROBST: Yeah. >> Well, I don't"
567,00:37:04.29,00:37:04.29,pose any threat at this point. Especially as far
568,00:37:08.25,00:37:08.25,"as challenges go. >> PROBST: Janu, why keep you?"
569,00:37:14.62,00:37:14.62,>> No reason. They can get rid of me.
570,00:37:20.17,00:37:20.17,>> PROBST: There's no reason they should keep you?
571,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,">> No, because, I mean, I have to be honest."
572,00:37:26.04,00:37:26.04,"I had a really rocky road so, if I was them, God, I'd be sick"
573,00:37:31.04,00:37:31.04,of myself already. >> PROBST: You almost seem like
574,00:37:34.62,00:37:34.62,"you want to go home. >> It doesn't matter, Jeff."
575,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"Whatever happens, happens. I'm... I'm completely satisfied."
576,00:37:42.17,00:37:42.17,">> PROBST: Is there a part of you that wants to say ""Vote me"
577,00:37:45.50,00:37:45.50,"out""? >> Yes. Absolutely."
578,00:37:48.04,00:37:48.04,But I don't know what they'll do.
579,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,">> PROBST: Ian, why keep somebody who's saying, ""I want"
580,00:37:53.38,00:37:53.38,"out of this game. I'm not going back to camp""?"
581,00:37:56.25,00:37:56.25,">> Well, if you feel like you don't want"
582,00:37:58.46,00:37:58.46,"to continue in this game-- if you feel like, you know, you"
583,00:38:01.21,00:38:01.21,want to set your torch down-- then you have the
584,00:38:03.46,00:38:03.46,power to do that. You have the ability and the
585,00:38:05.75,00:38:05.75,"power to set your torch down at any time, and there's nobody"
586,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,"keeping you here. >> PROBST: Stephenie, if looks"
587,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,"could kill, Janu would be on the ground."
588,00:38:13.96,00:38:13.96,>> It's just... it's just... it's nothing against Janu.
589,00:38:16.67,00:38:16.67,This... It... it kills me. I can't even...
590,00:38:19.92,00:38:19.92,"Someone who I feel, like, could care less"
591,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,if they're even here. ( crying )
592,00:38:27.08,00:38:27.08,"And here I am, like... I'd kill to be here."
593,00:38:33.25,00:38:33.25,">> Yeah, but... what you need to understand from my point is"
594,00:38:37.79,00:38:37.79,that I already received what I needed to receive
595,00:38:40.25,00:38:40.25,from this whole experience. >> And you're fine with that.
596,00:38:42.17,00:38:42.17,>> Yes. >> You could care less if you
597,00:38:44.25,00:38:44.25,"leave right now, right? >> Yes. That's... that's"
598,00:38:46.46,00:38:46.46,correct. >> I care. I...
599,00:38:48.54,00:38:48.54,"I'm not done playing this game and, like,"
600,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,"if someone asked me to vote them out, see ya, because"
601,00:38:53.79,00:38:53.79,you don't deserve to be here. ( sniffles )
602,00:38:56.50,00:38:56.50,And I'm... >> PROBST: So you feel you're
603,00:39:01.92,00:39:01.92,on the hot seat tonight? >> I know I am.
604,00:39:10.00,00:39:10.00,It's just... it's not that. It just... it kills me
605,00:39:14.96,00:39:14.96,"that someone who wants to basically go home that bad,"
606,00:39:17.96,00:39:17.96,these people will keep around just because...
607,00:39:21.67,00:39:21.67,I don't know why. I guess I showed too much heart
608,00:39:25.08,00:39:25.08,"and too much will. >> PROBST: Tom, in your"
609,00:39:28.38,00:39:28.38,"profession, unity, camaraderie-- big part of it."
610,00:39:34.25,00:39:34.25,"When you hear somebody like that laying it out, and you have"
611,00:39:37.62,00:39:37.62,"somebody next to them who's saying,"
612,00:39:40.46,00:39:40.46,"""Please get rid of me,"" is there a dilemma for you?"
613,00:39:44.21,00:39:44.21,>> There is a dilemma. Um... Stephenie would fit into
614,00:39:47.62,00:39:47.62,"a 108 truck in a moment, and, uh, everybody in the company"
615,00:39:51.50,00:39:51.50,"would be proud to work with her. And it's... it's not work,"
616,00:39:54.33,00:39:54.33,and it's not camaraderie. It's Survivor.
617,00:39:58.12,00:39:58.12,So there's a huge difference here.
618,00:40:02.04,00:40:02.04,">> PROBST: Janu, if you had your way, what would happen tonight?"
619,00:40:06.29,00:40:06.29,>> I would ask the tribe to vote me out and keep Stephenie in.
620,00:40:09.25,00:40:09.25,>> PROBST: What's the difference between you
621,00:40:12.83,00:40:12.83,"laying your torch down, and you looking to this group"
622,00:40:15.29,00:40:15.29,"and saying, ""Vote me out""? >> I guess, after reflecting,"
623,00:40:21.29,00:40:21.29,"and, um, understanding this, there would be no difference."
624,00:40:25.75,00:40:25.75,So I would be willing to lay down my torch so that Stephenie
625,00:40:29.42,00:40:29.42,can have a chance to stay in the game.
626,00:40:36.21,00:40:36.21,>> Not just for me. If she wants to lay down her
627,00:40:39.75,00:40:39.75,"torch and she wants to quit this game, she can do it, but..."
628,00:40:43.21,00:40:43.21,not on my account. >> Do you want me to rephrase
629,00:40:45.33,00:40:45.33,it? What I am saying
630,00:40:47.38,00:40:47.38,"is, I will lay down my torch, and I don't want Stephenie"
631,00:40:50.50,00:40:50.50,to feel that I am doing it for her.
632,00:40:53.08,00:40:53.08,That's something that I have to do.
633,00:40:55.33,00:40:55.33,>> PROBST: I just want to be clear.
634,00:40:57.54,00:40:57.54,"You are, on your own, quitting this game?"
635,00:41:01.08,00:41:01.08,">> Yes, Jeff. I will lay down"
636,00:41:03.25,00:41:03.25,"my torch this evening. >> PROBST: Well, I don't"
637,00:41:07.04,00:41:07.04,know if it's appropriate. We have rain coming down.
638,00:41:10.29,00:41:10.29,Maybe this is your final epiphany or cleansing moment.
639,00:41:12.71,00:41:12.71,I see that you brought all your belongings.
640,00:41:15.12,00:41:15.12,"Go ahead and gather them, bring your torch over."
641,00:41:27.58,00:41:27.58,"Janu, per your wishes, this game is over for you, but you will"
642,00:41:30.21,00:41:30.21,not go home. You'll return and be a part
643,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,"of our jury. Thank you, Jeff."
644,00:41:36.00,00:41:36.00,>> PROBST: Good night. Another strange turn of events
645,00:41:53.38,00:41:53.38,"at Tribal Council. Steph, you've hung in there"
646,00:41:55.54,00:41:55.54,"for a long time, overcome a lot of odds."
647,00:41:58.12,00:41:58.12,You escaped another one tonight. Sounds like you have your work
648,00:42:01.25,00:42:01.25,"cut out for you. Grab your torches, guys."
649,00:42:03.21,00:42:03.21,Head back to camp. Good night.
650,00:42:19.75,00:42:19.75,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
651,00:42:24.33,00:42:24.33,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
652,00:42:26.25,00:42:26.25,>> Tom might have to be the next to go.
653,00:42:28.17,00:42:28.17,>> PROBST: Stephenie steps up her game.
654,00:42:30.21,00:42:30.21,">> I'll do it, if you guys are game."
655,00:42:32.42,00:42:32.42,>> PROBST: And one of the men could take the fall.
656,00:42:36.12,00:42:36.12,">> We didn't vote Stephenie out when we should have, which is"
657,00:42:38.54,00:42:38.54,the first round. You want to think I'm a threat?
658,00:42:42.21,00:42:42.21,I'll show you how threatening I am.
659,00:42:49.79,00:42:49.79,">> I asked them to please let me go home, and it didn't work,"
660,00:42:53.08,00:42:53.08,"so I made the last move, and I decided to take myself"
661,00:42:56.04,00:42:56.04,out of the game. I guess I did make
662,00:42:58.96,00:42:58.96,"a major power play, and I guess I did ruin their plans."
663,00:43:02.00,00:43:02.00,"Even though I laid down my torch, no one will ever be able"
664,00:43:05.04,00:43:05.04,to take away this most unforgettable experience.
665,00:43:07.38,00:43:07.38,No one.
