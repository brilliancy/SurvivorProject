8,00:00:17.46,00:00:17.46,Is that kosher?
9,00:00:19.83,00:00:19.83,>> I'm a little bit worried that it might play out to

22,00:00:51.88,00:00:51.88,I just don't fit the stereotype.
23,00:00:52.96,00:00:52.96,It's a very dangerous position for me to be in.

45,00:01:40.08,00:01:40.08,And the two men from Hiki chose Jonathan.

78,00:04:17.12,00:04:17.12,>> It's sparking.
79,00:04:17.96,00:04:17.96,That'd be something.
80,00:04:19.83,00:04:19.83,">> Is it the wind, you think?"
81,00:04:20.67,00:04:20.67,>> We were all a little disheartened.

85,00:04:43.42,00:04:43.42,">> We tried, and we just couldn't get it going."
86,00:04:46.12,00:04:46.12,I don't understand what we're doing wrong.
87,00:04:48.12,00:04:48.12,"We should have fire, but that's not happening."
88,00:04:57.117,00:04:57.117,"We should have fire, but that's not happening."
89,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,>> We're going to make this fire.
90,00:05:07.71,00:05:07.71,It is absolute desperation time.
91,00:05:09.21,00:05:09.21,We've got to do it now.
92,00:05:10.88,00:05:10.88,">> All right, I'm going to try it."
93,00:05:20.92,00:05:20.92,">> All right, I'm going to try it."
94,00:05:28.71,00:05:28.71,">> Guys, it's lit."
95,00:05:30.79,00:05:30.79,What do we do now?
96,00:05:41.25,00:05:41.25,( laughter ) >> We've got a fire.
97,00:05:44.54,00:05:44.54,We've got a fire.
98,00:05:49.08,00:05:49.08,Whoo!
99,00:05:51.08,00:05:51.08,The fire was started by Rebecca.
100,00:05:53.25,00:05:53.25,"Girls, I knew they were all going to step up and really be,"
101,00:05:56.79,00:05:56.79,"like, some tough sisters, and that's what they've done."
102,00:05:58.62,00:05:58.62,And I'm so happy.
103,00:06:00.17,00:06:00.17,"Burn, baby, burn!"
104,00:06:03.54,00:06:03.54,>> This has been a great day for our team.
105,00:06:06.38,00:06:06.38,We're figuring it out and working as one team.
106,00:06:09.75,00:06:09.75,And I couldn't ask for anything more.
107,00:06:19.79,00:06:19.79,And I couldn't ask for anything more.
108,00:06:31.29,00:06:31.29,">> The Aitutaki tribe is doing really, really, really"
109,00:06:34.17,00:06:34.17,well.
110,00:06:36.00,00:06:36.00,"This morning we went and got fish together, and we captured"
111,00:06:38.33,00:06:38.33,"like eight, nine fish and got seven or eight clams, big ones."
112,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,>> Yeah.
113,00:06:45.67,00:06:45.67,>> All right.
114,00:06:46.67,00:06:46.67,Look at our bucket.
115,00:06:50.46,00:06:50.46,>> Latinos are good workers.
116,00:06:51.58,00:06:51.58,"It's kind of in our blood, it's in our heritage."
117,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,">> As me and my partners were running towards the arcade, I"
118,00:06:59.38,00:06:59.38,heard the shots being fired and I felt something hit my arm.
119,00:07:03.04,00:07:03.04,I fractured my humerus and shattered my radius.
120,00:07:05.79,00:07:05.79,"This morning, I brought up the fact that I'm a police officer"
121,00:07:09.62,00:07:09.62,"and that I was shot, almost losing my arm."
122,00:07:12.04,00:07:12.04,And that was a life-changing experience for me.
123,00:07:14.25,00:07:14.25,Initially they were going to take my arm.
124,00:07:16.54,00:07:16.54,The doctors told my mom they wanted to take my arm because
125,00:07:19.04,00:07:19.04,it was so bad and I lost so much blood.
126,00:07:21.04,00:07:21.04,>> Christina is a super strong woman.
127,00:07:23.04,00:07:23.04,I definitely respect all the stuff that she's gone through
128,00:07:24.58,00:07:24.58,in her life.
129,00:07:25.88,00:07:25.88,She's definitely a role model as far as I see it.
130,00:07:27.38,00:07:27.38,>> So I got my arm back and came back to work full time.
131,00:07:30.04,00:07:30.04,>> That's huge.
132,00:07:31.12,00:07:31.12,That's huge.
133,00:07:32.50,00:07:32.50,>> That's why I wear the bullet.
134,00:07:39.29,00:07:39.29,">> There are the chickens over there, they're walking past."
135,00:07:41.58,00:07:41.58,Look over the clothesline.
136,00:07:43.38,00:07:43.38,>> We've been trying to figure out how to snag a chicken for a
137,00:07:45.79,00:07:45.79,few days.
138,00:07:47.29,00:07:47.29,"We've seen them running around wild all over the place, so we"
139,00:07:49.25,00:07:49.25,decided to make a chicken trap.
140,00:07:50.88,00:07:50.88,">> Once the chicken goes up top, we can pull the net and it will"
141,00:07:53.92,00:07:53.92,kind of catch them like in a little bag.
142,00:07:56.46,00:07:56.46,">> Oh, you want to do it that way?"
143,00:07:59.17,00:07:59.17,">> Tina had her chance to set it up, and I'm making a concerted"
144,00:08:01.79,00:08:01.79,effort not to shoot down all of her ideas.
145,00:08:05.17,00:08:05.17,But a lot of the ideas she has are coming from somebody who's
146,00:08:08.96,00:08:08.96,"not done a lot of camping, who's not been in the outdoors a lot,"
147,00:08:11.54,00:08:11.54,so they don't make sense to me.
148,00:08:12.96,00:08:12.96,">> I think we should stretch it, like, wide across here and then"
149,00:08:16.21,00:08:16.21,"we'll create, like, a little tunnel."
150,00:08:21.25,00:08:21.25,>> Let's do it.
151,00:08:23.71,00:08:23.71,">> Ozzy feels like he knows everything, and he probably"
152,00:08:26.12,00:08:26.12,"does, but every idea has to be his idea."
153,00:08:28.79,00:08:28.79,So he is getting under my skin a little bit.
154,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50,>> I think we can do it.
155,00:08:32.54,00:08:32.54,"Look, we have this line right here."
156,00:08:34.79,00:08:34.79,"Christina and I, we don't click very well."
157,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,"I think it's because, for one thing, she's a cop, and also"
158,00:08:39.29,00:08:39.29,just the fact that I'm ten years younger than her and I
159,00:08:42.04,00:08:42.04,"understand, because if I had a 14-year-old telling me what to"
160,00:08:45.08,00:08:45.08,"do, I'd probably get a little pissed off myself."
161,00:08:55.12,00:08:55.12,"do, I'd probably get a little pissed off myself."
162,00:09:02.71,00:09:02.71,">> I feel like I've shown what I offer to the tribe, so I feel"
163,00:09:06.67,00:09:06.67,comfortable with my standing within the rest of the group.
164,00:09:10.50,00:09:10.50,>> There is so much food to cook.
165,00:09:12.46,00:09:12.46,>> There's more.
166,00:09:13.33,00:09:13.33,">> Oh, is there really?"
167,00:09:14.08,00:09:14.08,">> Yeah, look."
168,00:09:15.08,00:09:15.08,>> Awesome.
169,00:09:15.83,00:09:15.83,>> Tina?
170,00:09:18.62,00:09:18.62,>> Is she upset?
171,00:09:20.04,00:09:20.04,>> Is she?
172,00:09:42.08,00:09:42.08,">> We got two chickens, woo-hoo!"
173,00:09:44.12,00:09:44.12,We've got two of them at one time.
174,00:09:46.50,00:09:46.50,"There's two, right?"
175,00:09:47.75,00:09:47.75,">> There's two, yeah."
176,00:09:48.58,00:09:48.58,>> Yes.
177,00:09:49.38,00:09:49.38,">> Good job, Yul, good job."
178,00:09:50.75,00:09:50.75,>> Day four for the Puka tribe started out on a really
179,00:09:52.96,00:09:52.96,high note because Yul actually caught two of the chickens.
180,00:09:55.62,00:09:55.62,We're really excited because I think everybody was pretty
181,00:09:58.08,00:09:58.08,hungry for something substantial.
182,00:10:00.08,00:10:00.08,Yul's a smart guy.
183,00:10:01.50,00:10:01.50,He's very intelligent and a good person to have on your
184,00:10:03.88,00:10:03.88,side.
185,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,>>( inaudible ) I trust you because I feel like...
186,00:10:10.04,00:10:10.04,">> No, that's what... even from the very beginning, yeah."
187,00:10:13.00,00:10:13.00,">> Becky, she's a lawyer, but she does a lot of non-profit"
188,00:10:15.42,00:10:15.42,work.
189,00:10:16.71,00:10:16.71,I respect that and I don't think someone like that
190,00:10:18.12,00:10:18.12,"is likely to be in this game just to make a lot of money, so"
191,00:10:20.25,00:10:20.25,I trust her.
192,00:10:21.50,00:10:21.50,>> I would love to see one of us do it.
193,00:10:23.62,00:10:23.62,">> Especially if there were, like, Korean..."
194,00:10:26.12,00:10:26.12,>> That's why I want us to stay together.
195,00:10:28.50,00:10:28.50,"Yul and I are both Korean, so obviously there's a bond"
196,00:10:31.50,00:10:31.50,"there, and we're automatically going to form alliances because"
197,00:10:34.21,00:10:34.21,of that.
198,00:10:35.88,00:10:35.88,"In Korean, you call an older brother an oppa, and Yul seems"
199,00:10:39.25,00:10:39.25,sort of like an older brother to me.
200,00:10:41.62,00:10:41.62,">> Sticking together, obviously, would help us in"
201,00:10:43.42,00:10:43.42,the game.
202,00:10:44.29,00:10:44.29,>> I want to stay together.
203,00:10:46.12,00:10:46.12,I agree.
204,00:10:47.04,00:10:47.04,Cool.
205,00:10:57.04,00:10:57.04,">> Oh, I think it's him."
206,00:10:59.17,00:10:59.17,Papa bear is coming home.
207,00:11:01.33,00:11:01.33,"( screaming ) >> Oh, God."
208,00:11:11.67,00:11:11.67,"Exile Island was really terrible, but I came back to my"
209,00:11:15.12,00:11:15.12,tribe and they're all very happy to see me and I'm happy
210,00:11:17.21,00:11:17.21,to see them.
211,00:11:20.00,00:11:20.00,>> All over the place.
212,00:11:21.83,00:11:21.83,"I dug around for the idol; I didn't find it, unfortunately."
213,00:11:24.42,00:11:24.42,"Now I've come back and, like, these guys haven't done"
214,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,anything.
215,00:11:28.29,00:11:28.29,How is the shelter for the rain?
216,00:11:30.04,00:11:30.04,">> Well, the most uncomfortable part is the floor."
217,00:11:32.12,00:11:32.12,>> We slept on the ground.
218,00:11:33.83,00:11:33.83,>> Why don't we start a fire and let's make this floor.
219,00:11:36.83,00:11:36.83,You know what I mean?
220,00:11:38.21,00:11:38.21,Because it's going to be night four and we don't have a
221,00:11:40.25,00:11:40.25,real shelter for ourselves.
222,00:11:42.42,00:11:42.42,I don't understand why they don't have a better floor.
223,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,"Basically, it's the same shack they've been in for three or"
224,00:11:47.75,00:11:47.75,four days.
225,00:11:49.25,00:11:49.25,I don't understand that.
226,00:11:54.04,00:11:54.04,>> I'm really excited about pimping out our palace.
227,00:11:56.58,00:11:56.58,>> Yeah.
228,00:11:58.08,00:11:58.08,>> Jonathan and I decided to pick up the speed a bit and
229,00:12:00.46,00:12:00.46,try to get something done to make our camp better.
230,00:12:04.46,00:12:04.46,"But Parvati, Adam and Candice, they like to gossip and waste"
231,00:12:09.12,00:12:09.12,time and not really do things.
232,00:12:11.71,00:12:11.71,"And I was just like, ""Somebody do something."""
233,00:12:13.88,00:12:13.88,Let's get some things done.
234,00:12:15.08,00:12:15.08,"Hey Adam, this is quite a bit of work."
235,00:12:18.12,00:12:18.12,>> I think it's the dumbest thing to be doing this.
236,00:12:20.58,00:12:20.58,Why do you think you'll sleep better when it's raised than on
237,00:12:23.21,00:12:23.21,the ground?
238,00:12:24.21,00:12:24.21,>> It was wet and it was cold.
239,00:12:26.25,00:12:26.25,">> Yeah, but what does raised going to do to change that?"
240,00:12:29.08,00:12:29.08,>> We won't be on the wet ground.
241,00:12:31.17,00:12:31.17,>> Do you two want a raised platform?
242,00:12:32.96,00:12:32.96,>> I thought it sounded nice.
243,00:12:34.75,00:12:34.75,">> I know you do, but these two."
244,00:12:36.33,00:12:36.33,We didn't decide things as a group.
245,00:12:38.21,00:12:38.21,"I want to know what y'all's opinion is, you two, on the"
246,00:12:40.21,00:12:40.21,floor?
247,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,You guys haven't said anything.
248,00:12:42.75,00:12:42.75,>> I think the flat bamboo would be comfortable and it's
249,00:12:45.71,00:12:45.71,already started.
250,00:12:47.83,00:12:47.83,">> It's crazy, I think."
251,00:12:49.21,00:12:49.21,">> Well, what do you want to do today?"
252,00:12:51.00,00:12:51.00,>> I just don't want to waste energy on something that... just
253,00:12:52.96,00:12:52.96,to look good.
254,00:12:54.88,00:12:54.88,I mean this is...
255,00:12:58.08,00:12:58.08,>> I don't know.
256,00:12:59.50,00:12:59.50,Let's see if we can get this floor done.
257,00:13:02.54,00:13:02.54,Adam is hungry and he's crabby and he doesn't understand that
258,00:13:06.00,00:13:06.00,other people have other needs.
259,00:13:07.42,00:13:07.42,And I don't need him being like that.
260,00:13:18.12,00:13:18.12,>> I won't.
261,00:13:19.25,00:13:19.25,I won't.
262,00:13:36.12,00:13:36.12,">> Oh, my God."
263,00:13:37.25,00:13:37.25,Wow.
264,00:13:38.54,00:13:38.54,We got five of them.
265,00:13:39.50,00:13:39.50,">> Oh, wow!"
266,00:13:45.29,00:13:45.29,">> Definitely, I've been trying to conserve my energy because,"
267,00:13:47.75,00:13:47.75,"(a), I don't have a whole lot of energy to burn, and (b), I think"
268,00:13:52.21,00:13:52.21,it's stupid to just waste your time doing something you
269,00:13:55.08,00:13:55.08,don't know anything about.
270,00:13:56.29,00:13:56.29,"So, since they know more about spearing fish and getting"
271,00:13:59.04,00:13:59.04,"coconuts and whatnot, I just let them burn the energy and I'll"
272,00:14:02.54,00:14:02.54,just go ahead and have some of whatever they catch.
273,00:14:05.38,00:14:05.38,>> You want to start getting that net together for the
274,00:14:07.58,00:14:07.58,chicken?
275,00:14:08.58,00:14:08.58,>> We need to clean it off nice and flat.
276,00:14:19.83,00:14:19.83,"You know, it's really difficult if everyone's not pulling their"
277,00:14:22.33,00:14:22.33,"weight, you know?"
278,00:14:24.29,00:14:24.29,It gets tiring having to tell someone what to do all of
279,00:14:27.42,00:14:27.42,the time.
280,00:14:28.88,00:14:28.88,"I go, ""Billy, can you do this?"" ""Billy, can you do that?"""
281,00:14:30.17,00:14:30.17,"""Billy, can you do this?"" You know, I hate saying that."
282,00:14:40.21,00:14:40.21,"""Billy, can you do this?"" You know, I hate saying that."
283,00:14:58.79,00:14:58.79,">> Well, I think we all just work together instead of kind"
284,00:15:01.42,00:15:01.42,of going off in our own little ways.
285,00:15:03.21,00:15:03.21,>> I agree.
286,00:15:04.21,00:15:04.21,>> It will work out so much better.
287,00:15:05.21,00:15:05.21,">> I don't know, I guess I kind of feel a little bit on the"
288,00:15:06.96,00:15:06.96,outside sometimes.
289,00:15:08.00,00:15:08.00,">> They shouldn't... you know what, you should..."
290,00:15:09.96,00:15:09.96,">> It's like, I don't relate the same way as, like... even"
291,00:15:11.38,00:15:11.38,"though I'm Hispanic, I don't feel Hispanic, you know?"
292,00:15:13.79,00:15:13.79,It's like metal is my culture instead of Hispanic being my
293,00:15:16.58,00:15:16.58,culture.
294,00:15:18.12,00:15:18.12,">> I think that's good, because you have differences you bring"

300,00:15:35.62,00:15:35.62,">> So you don't feel excluded, like, you know, jump in."
301,00:15:43.25,00:15:43.25,">> I was working directly in the hot sun, and I quickly got"
302,00:15:47.00,00:15:47.00,"a headache, and Cao Boi came in with his magical powers."
303,00:15:52.67,00:15:52.67,">> There's a deep, deep red."
304,00:15:54.21,00:15:54.21,Yours is just red.
305,00:15:55.58,00:15:55.58,Yours will probably go away within a day.
306,00:15:58.08,00:15:58.08,"Most of the people I know in my life, sooner or later, if"
307,00:16:00.00,00:16:00.00,"they're friends with me long enough, they experience a red"

309,00:16:07.92,00:16:07.92,You're done.
310,00:16:09.12,00:16:09.12,>> ( laughs ) Thank you.
311,00:16:11.38,00:16:11.38,"It helps, a lot."
312,00:16:13.79,00:16:13.79,It felt great.
313,00:16:15.42,00:16:15.42,I asked him not to give me the same kind of slash he gave to
314,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,Brad.
315,00:16:19.46,00:16:19.46,But apparently I guess I have something here now.
316,00:16:21.58,00:16:21.58,But at least my headache's gone.
317,00:16:31.62,00:16:31.62,But at least my headache's gone.
318,00:16:42.25,00:16:42.25,">> Oh, I make fun of them all the time."
319,00:16:44.12,00:16:44.12,"You've got to be able to laugh at yourself, first of all."
320,00:16:46.50,00:16:46.50,">> Well, of course, but, I don't know, I think if you"
321,00:16:48.62,00:16:48.62,were a little bit sensitive about it because of the
322,00:16:50.67,00:16:50.67,situation...
323,00:16:52.21,00:16:52.21,">> I have no hang-up, you know, and I can just make fun of it"
324,00:16:54.21,00:16:54.21,and just laugh.
325,00:16:55.54,00:16:55.54,Like what do you call a Vietnamese with three dogs?
326,00:16:58.29,00:16:58.29,">> I think the bigger picture is, like, we get it, but a lot"
327,00:17:00.83,00:17:00.83,of people won't get it.
328,00:17:02.62,00:17:02.62,>> Exactly.
329,00:17:03.79,00:17:03.79,>> I don't worry about what other people think.
330,00:17:06.17,00:17:06.17,They get to my case because you make this racist joke about

332,00:17:12.71,00:17:12.71,represent your race is not about avoiding the jokes.

336,00:17:23.08,00:17:23.08,">> Well, a joke is a joke, right?"
337,00:17:25.21,00:17:25.21,">> No, it's not."
338,00:17:26.12,00:17:26.12,>> No?

340,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,offensive to anyone here at all?
341,00:17:30.58,00:17:30.58,>> No.
342,00:17:33.96,00:17:33.96,>> One thing about Cao Boi is it's good to have a sense of

346,00:18:08.21,00:18:08.21,I think it could help us in the long run because we're not

364,00:18:52.17,00:18:52.17,disappointing.
365,00:18:53.38,00:18:53.38,And I don't know if I can trust Oscar anymore.

402,00:20:48.17,00:20:48.17,"All right, first things first-- take back immunity."
403,00:20:58.12,00:20:58.12,"Once again, immunity back up for grabs."
404,00:21:02.38,00:21:02.38,I'm going to read you a short story about Captain Cook's
405,00:21:05.17,00:21:05.17,three historic expeditions into the Pacific.
406,00:21:08.88,00:21:08.88,"When I'm finished reading the story, you're going to move as a"
407,00:21:11.29,00:21:11.29,group tied together.
408,00:21:13.12,00:21:13.12,You'll go under and over a series of logs.
409,00:21:15.67,00:21:15.67,You'll go through a field of poles where you must untie and
410,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83,gather seven answer plaques.
411,00:21:22.12,00:21:22.12,You'll cross a two-line rope bridge over a pit of water.
412,00:21:25.46,00:21:25.46,"Once you reach the finish, you will use the seven plaques"
413,00:21:28.54,00:21:28.54,to answer five questions about the story.
414,00:21:32.12,00:21:32.12,Make sense?
415,00:21:33.17,00:21:33.17,>> Yes.

420,00:21:45.21,00:21:45.21,rain.
421,00:21:46.79,00:21:46.79,"So, to be clear, the first tribe to finish gets the tarps; first"

423,00:21:54.25,00:21:54.25,somebody going home.
424,00:21:56.08,00:21:56.08,"And once again, the losing tribe will decide which tribe"
425,00:21:59.62,00:21:59.62,member from the other tribes goes to Exile Island.
426,00:22:02.92,00:22:02.92,Clear?
427,00:22:04.25,00:22:04.25,>> Clear.

435,00:22:18.29,00:22:18.29,Totally... I'm out.
436,00:22:19.75,00:22:19.75,>> All right.
437,00:22:20.62,00:22:20.62,>> Okay.

444,00:22:33.58,00:22:33.58,"Okay, I'll read the story: ""James Cook's first voyage took"

455,00:23:07.08,00:23:07.08,"Now, after hearing this story, if you are not confident that"

458,00:23:16.29,00:23:16.29,Keep in mind reading the book could cost you valuable time.
459,00:23:20.29,00:23:20.29,"For immunity and reward, survivors ready?"
460,00:23:24.17,00:23:24.17,Go!

462,00:23:33.12,00:23:33.12,taking the time to look through it and make sure they are right.

464,00:23:40.17,00:23:40.17,Everybody getting up and over the log.

495,00:25:07.50,00:25:07.50,Puka has it.

503,00:25:26.29,00:25:26.29,Puka doing a great job on the bridge.
504,00:25:30.21,00:25:30.21,It's Puka and Raro fighting for reward.
505,00:25:34.12,00:25:34.12,Hiki starting to make up some ground.
506,00:25:36.62,00:25:36.62,"Aitu not panicking, but they're not moving quickly either."
507,00:25:40.17,00:25:40.17,>> Here we go.
508,00:25:42.00,00:25:42.00,>> It's okay.

513,00:25:54.79,00:25:54.79,>> Cook located the Hawaiian Islands and called them
514,00:25:57.25,00:25:57.25,Sandwich Islands.
515,00:25:58.92,00:25:58.92,>> That's right.

521,00:26:21.00,00:26:21.00,Hiki working together well.
522,00:26:22.54,00:26:22.54,They're still in this challenge.
523,00:26:24.50,00:26:24.50,Immunity on the line.
524,00:26:31.08,00:26:31.08,">> Tahiti, yeah."

528,00:26:50.62,00:26:50.62,Hiki has it right!

530,00:26:59.88,00:26:59.88,from tribal council.
531,00:27:05.50,00:27:05.50,"Okay, first order of business: after reviewing the tapes, it"
532,00:27:09.54,00:27:09.54,is clear the challenge ended in a tie between Puka and
533,00:27:13.62,00:27:13.62,Rarotonga.
534,00:27:16.21,00:27:16.21,You'll each be getting two tarps.
535,00:27:18.96,00:27:18.96,"All right, Aitu, the only good thing about losing this"
536,00:27:21.58,00:27:21.58,"challenge, you get to decide who is going to Exile Island."
537,00:27:25.54,00:27:25.54,A big decision to make.
538,00:27:28.75,00:27:28.75,Who's it going to be?
539,00:27:30.62,00:27:30.62,">> We're going to send Yul, the strongest member over there."
540,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,So we'll try to weaken them up there.
541,00:27:35.42,00:27:35.42,">> Yul, boat's waiting for you now."
542,00:27:38.08,00:27:38.08,"Head down to the beach, boat will pick you up."
543,00:27:51.42,00:27:51.42,">> One thing left to do: Hiki, immunity, no tribal council."
544,00:27:57.25,00:27:57.25,"( applause ) Puka, you, too, are safe."
545,00:28:04.08,00:28:04.08,"Raro, no tribal council."
546,00:28:06.33,00:28:06.33,"Aitu, you know what that means-- tribal council, date"
547,00:28:09.21,00:28:09.21,"with me, somebody going home."
548,00:28:10.42,00:28:10.42,"Grab your stuff, head on back to camp."
549,00:28:20.46,00:28:20.46,"Grab your stuff, head on back to camp."
550,00:28:33.25,00:28:33.25,">> We lost the challenge, basically on purpose, and I'm"
551,00:28:36.00,00:28:36.00,"sorry to say that, but it's something that we had to do."
552,00:28:39.04,00:28:39.04,Billy dug his own hole by just not working.
553,00:28:42.21,00:28:42.21,And his lack of work showed a lack of commitment to the tribe.
554,00:28:49.88,00:28:49.88,And you guys are lollygagging.
555,00:28:53.50,00:28:53.50,">> Losing that challenge, it just really bothered me."
556,00:28:56.04,00:28:56.04,It was such an easy game.
557,00:28:57.38,00:28:57.38,It just makes me realize that Ozzy is very conniving.
558,00:29:00.62,00:29:00.62,He's just all for himself.
559,00:29:02.12,00:29:02.12,And I really see him trying to control everything.
560,00:29:06.71,00:29:06.71,">> No, you don't have... I mean, yeah, you can do it"
561,00:29:09.83,00:29:09.83,like that.
562,00:29:11.04,00:29:11.04,I just like to...
563,00:29:12.04,00:29:12.04,">> So right now, the situation is pretty bleak."
564,00:29:14.12,00:29:14.12,"I just hope to God I can find some opening, some crack to go"
565,00:29:18.12,00:29:18.12,through and somehow pull it out.
566,00:29:27.117,00:29:27.117,through and somehow pull it out.
567,00:29:35.38,00:29:35.38,>> Going to Exile Island really sucked.
568,00:29:38.67,00:29:38.67,There's pretty much nothing on it.
569,00:29:41.29,00:29:41.29,I feel like I have a pretty strong connection with the
570,00:29:43.96,00:29:43.96,members of my tribe.
571,00:29:45.21,00:29:45.21,"I miss them, hopefully they miss me, and it will be an"
572,00:29:46.67,00:29:46.67,opportunity just to uncover the immunity idol.
573,00:29:53.25,00:29:53.25,"""Use the mast and an island to form a letter."
574,00:29:58.88,00:29:58.88,"Block out the south island and you're doing better."""
575,00:30:09.54,00:30:09.54,"From the clues, I basically take it that I have to line up"
576,00:30:13.08,00:30:13.08,"one of two possible isles to get an ""A"" shape using the"
577,00:30:17.17,00:30:17.17,isle and the mast.
578,00:30:19.92,00:30:19.92,The last bit of the clue is that I have to make southern
579,00:30:23.04,00:30:23.04,"island disappear, so I assume that I keep walking up and down"
580,00:30:26.25,00:30:26.25,"the line until I can no longer see the southern isle, and so"
581,00:30:29.42,00:30:29.42,I've marked the place where that occurs.
582,00:30:39.46,00:30:39.46,I've marked the place where that occurs.
583,00:30:59.46,00:30:59.46,I've marked the place where that occurs.
584,00:31:08.62,00:31:08.62,"Oh, mama."
585,00:31:10.75,00:31:10.75,"Oh, wow."
586,00:31:23.29,00:31:23.29,Yes!
587,00:31:26.21,00:31:26.21,It's a compass.
588,00:31:28.29,00:31:28.29,"""You have just discovered something of great value."
589,00:31:30.42,00:31:30.42,This immunity idol will keep you safe from being voted off
590,00:31:33.04,00:31:33.04,at tribal council once only.
591,00:31:34.29,00:31:34.29,The last time you can use any hidden immunity idol is when
592,00:31:36.96,00:31:36.96,they are four survivors remaining in the game.
593,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,"I found the immunity idol, which is probably the single"
594,00:31:41.71,00:31:41.71,biggest stroke of luck I could have had.
595,00:31:44.17,00:31:44.17,"If there is a clear opportunity where it can change the game,"
596,00:31:46.92,00:31:46.92,I'll use it.

598,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,>> Would you rinse it out before you put any stuff in?
599,00:32:04.00,00:32:04.00,>> Yeah.
600,00:32:12.62,00:32:12.62,You don't feel bad?
601,00:32:14.04,00:32:14.04,>> It's all right.
602,00:32:15.29,00:32:15.29,He's not trustworthy.
603,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,"I don't feel bad, I really don't."
604,00:32:22.33,00:32:22.33,">> Once I figured it out, I didn't want to be in this tribe"
605,00:32:24.75,00:32:24.75,anymore.
606,00:32:25.75,00:32:25.75,I think those two guys played me for a patsy.
607,00:32:28.38,00:32:28.38,That whole taking your sweet time basically was a game.
608,00:32:31.79,00:32:31.79,"And once I'm gone, you're on the block."
609,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,>> Exactly.
610,00:32:35.71,00:32:35.71,>> I hope they don't throw another game just to try to get
611,00:32:37.75,00:32:37.75,rid of you.
612,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,"My only avenue right now, my only shot, is with Christina."
613,00:32:43.29,00:32:43.29,"So, I just threw out there that if I go now, she is going"
614,00:32:47.08,00:32:47.08,next.
615,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,"And it flies with her, like, she understands it."
616,00:32:52.88,00:32:52.88,I really don't.
617,00:32:53.79,00:32:53.79,">> No, Ozzy's playing the hardest."
618,00:32:55.46,00:32:55.46,">> Yeah, he really is."
619,00:32:57.00,00:32:57.00,"In my job, I see people all the time, they're always in a lie."
620,00:32:58.79,00:32:58.79,And I had this feeling about Oscar...
621,00:33:00.92,00:33:00.92,"I think Oscar's more of a threat right now, and he has"
622,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,been really playing everybody.
623,00:33:04.25,00:33:04.25,Why have we voted someone from our own team off?
624,00:33:06.29,00:33:06.29,Let's be strong.
625,00:33:07.50,00:33:07.50,">> Yeah, absolutely."
626,00:33:10.50,00:33:10.50,>> I hope you do.
627,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,"Honestly, I hope you do."
628,00:33:20.62,00:33:20.62,"( speaking Spanish ) >> No, girl."
629,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,We're on the same page.
630,00:33:30.67,00:33:30.67,"Look him in the eye, for real."
631,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,We're on the same page.
632,00:33:32.96,00:33:32.96,>> Okay.
633,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,>> Christina came up to me and she asked me if Oscar and I had
634,00:33:37.92,00:33:37.92,any kind of alliance or any kind of an agreement.
635,00:33:40.62,00:33:40.62,And we don't.
636,00:33:41.79,00:33:41.79,But she asked that in Spanish.
637,00:33:44.08,00:33:44.08,>> I'm just kind of nervous.
638,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,Just wondering.
639,00:33:47.67,00:33:47.67,">> As a police officer, she has to trust her partners because"
640,00:33:50.25,00:33:50.25,her life depends on that.
641,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83,So I can imagine how a little bit of that is coming into play
642,00:33:55.46,00:33:55.46,here.
643,00:33:56.83,00:33:56.83,But I hope she can trust me because I'm being honest with
644,00:33:59.21,00:33:59.21,her.
645,00:34:00.38,00:34:00.38,"I'm good with you, for sure."
646,00:34:01.79,00:34:01.79,So it's whatever we decide to do is whatever we decide to do.
647,00:34:04.88,00:34:04.88,">> Okay, sounds good."
648,00:34:10.54,00:34:10.54,>> I do think Billy is going to stir stuff up-- going behind my
649,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,"back and trying to switch people over, trying to"
650,00:34:15.42,00:34:15.42,"flip-flop so that, you know, maybe it's me because he wants"
651,00:34:18.33,00:34:18.33,me gone.
652,00:34:19.71,00:34:19.71,Christina is probably going to be the most sympathetic.
653,00:34:22.38,00:34:22.38,"But if they want to throw me out, go ahead and do it because"
654,00:34:25.25,00:34:25.25,I know they're going to suffer really bad if they lose me.
655,00:34:32.08,00:34:32.08,">> My best hope is that somehow, someway, Christina"
656,00:34:35.12,00:34:35.12,found a way to get in Cecilia's ears and plant the
657,00:34:38.58,00:34:38.58,seed just long enough for her to swing a vote.
658,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,So all my chips are on Christina.
659,00:34:44.96,00:34:44.96,"My hand is a weak hand, but at least I got one queen."
660,00:34:54.100,00:34:54.100,"My hand is a weak hand, but at least I got one queen."
661,00:35:03.12,00:35:03.12,>> PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch.
662,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,"Go ahead and grab a torch, approach the flame and get"
663,00:35:07.17,00:35:07.17,fire.
664,00:35:08.67,00:35:08.67,This is part of the ritual of tribal council because in this
665,00:35:10.38,00:35:10.38,"game, fire represents your life."
666,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"As long as you have fire, you're still in the game."
667,00:35:16.54,00:35:16.54,"When your fire is gone, so you are."
668,00:35:19.29,00:35:19.29,Have a seat.
669,00:35:26.29,00:35:26.29,"So, let's talk about the first six days."
670,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,"Billy, did a leader step up and say, ""Here's what we're going"
671,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,"to do?"" >> Well, initially, we just hit"
672,00:35:34.42,00:35:34.42,"the ground running, but little by little, Ozzy emerged as the"
673,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,big voice.
674,00:35:39.79,00:35:39.79,This was his element; he's very much an outdoorsman.
675,00:35:42.88,00:35:42.88,">> PROBST: Christina, do you agree with Billy that Ozzy is"
676,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,the leader?
677,00:35:46.71,00:35:46.71,>> I don't feel that he's a leader.
678,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,I feel that he tries to take control of certain things
679,00:35:52.08,00:35:52.08,because he does have experience in this area; he feels a
680,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,little more confident in that.
681,00:35:56.46,00:35:56.46,">> PROBST: Ozzy, do you think you're the leader?"
682,00:35:58.58,00:35:58.58,">> No, I don't think I'm the leader."
683,00:36:00.75,00:36:00.75,There are certain things that I have specific knowledge of
684,00:36:03.08,00:36:03.08,"that if I don't voice my opinion, then it's going to get"
685,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,done wrong.
686,00:36:07.58,00:36:07.58,But I think that our strongest thing is we can all get things
687,00:36:11.25,00:36:11.25,done as a team and it gives us a lot of pride because we know
688,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,"that if we work hard, we're going to be stronger than"
689,00:36:18.29,00:36:18.29,anybody else.
690,00:36:19.96,00:36:19.96,>> PROBST: Do you think this tribe represented themselves
691,00:36:22.25,00:36:22.25,well in the last challenge?
692,00:36:23.25,00:36:23.25,">> No, the last challenge-- not really."
693,00:36:26.25,00:36:26.25,">> PROBST: Billy, when I asked the question, you're like,"
694,00:36:28.50,00:36:28.50,"""Oh, come on."""
695,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,">> Actually, a lot of our loss had to do with me."
696,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,J.P. and Ozzy decided I'm hurting the tribe way too much
697,00:36:35.58,00:36:35.58,and so they were going to throw the challenge.
698,00:36:38.21,00:36:38.21,>> PROBST: You believe they threw the challenge?
699,00:36:39.54,00:36:39.54,>> I know they threw the challenge.
700,00:36:41.75,00:36:41.75,">> PROBST: J.P., you threw a challenge?"
701,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,"With only five tribe members, you're already willing to lose"
702,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,somebody?
703,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,">> At this point, yeah."
704,00:36:48.75,00:36:48.75,I don't believe in having to carry weight of somebody
705,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,who I don't believe is trusting and who doesn't carry the
706,00:36:55.50,00:36:55.50,workload.
707,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,">> PROBST: Billy, are you surprised to hear that trust is"
708,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,an issue?
709,00:37:00.38,00:37:00.38,">> I understand that a game is being played, but I fell"
710,00:37:02.21,00:37:02.21,"into a classic trap, and now I'm on the chopping block."
711,00:37:04.88,00:37:04.88,">> No, no, no, no, no."
712,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,I hate the way he's trying to sound like he's a victim right
713,00:37:08.29,00:37:08.29,now.
714,00:37:09.08,00:37:09.08,>> I was a player.
715,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,I'm not saying I'm a victim.
716,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,>> And you know how to say the greatest things to make
717,00:37:12.88,00:37:12.88,yourself look so damn good.
718,00:37:14.42,00:37:14.42,">> I'm clawing and scratching or whatever-- yeah, I'm playing"
719,00:37:15.62,00:37:15.62,the game.
720,00:37:16.46,00:37:16.46,That's my dream.
721,00:37:17.79,00:37:17.79,>> Part of the game is trying to to involve yourself.
722,00:37:19.46,00:37:19.46,That way people find you valuable...
723,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,>> I'm still talking here.
724,00:37:22.08,00:37:22.08,I'm still talking here.
725,00:37:23.12,00:37:23.12,"You'll get your turn, Mr. Bully."
726,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,>> Obviously you're not valuable.
727,00:37:25.17,00:37:25.17,">> You're Mr. Bully, you'll get your turn."
728,00:37:27.08,00:37:27.08,>> Call me whatever you want.
729,00:37:28.25,00:37:28.25,>> I don't give a rat's ass.
730,00:37:29.08,00:37:29.08,"So, like I was saying, I'm playing the game."
731,00:37:31.29,00:37:31.29,That's what I came here to do.
732,00:37:32.08,00:37:32.08,My prize isn't even the million dollars.
733,00:37:34.25,00:37:34.25,"My prize was that I fell in love in this game, love at"
734,00:37:37.21,00:37:37.21,first sight.
735,00:37:38.42,00:37:38.42,Her name is Candice.
736,00:37:39.79,00:37:39.79,And in between...
737,00:37:41.12,00:37:41.12,( laughter ) >> PROBST: Candice from Raro
738,00:37:43.12,00:37:43.12,tribe?
739,00:37:44.25,00:37:44.25,>> Yeah.
740,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,"After the last challenge, we sort of mouthed the words ""I"
741,00:37:47.17,00:37:47.17,"love you"" to one another, and so that was my prize."
742,00:37:49.12,00:37:49.12,My prize was her.
743,00:37:50.92,00:37:50.92,>> PROBST: I've never heard anything that surprised me more
744,00:37:53.58,00:37:53.58,than what you just said.
745,00:37:54.92,00:37:54.92,And I want to be respectful because I don't know what
746,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,happened.
747,00:37:58.62,00:37:58.62,But what would she base feeling the same way you feel on?
748,00:38:01.71,00:38:01.71,">> I think it's just, you know, love at first sight."
749,00:38:03.79,00:38:03.79,I think it's just a rapport thing.
750,00:38:06.08,00:38:06.08,>> PROBST: So you're absolutely sincere now?
751,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,>> I'm dead serious.
752,00:38:11.75,00:38:11.75,">> PROBST: Ozzy, have you noticed anything between Candice"
753,00:38:14.25,00:38:14.25,and Billy?
754,00:38:15.33,00:38:15.33,">> Man, I haven't noticed anything."
755,00:38:17.75,00:38:17.75,"But, I mean, I'm not looking for it."
756,00:38:19.75,00:38:19.75,It's new to me as it is you.
757,00:38:22.04,00:38:22.04,">> PROBST: J.P., what's your take on the Billy/Candice"
758,00:38:24.25,00:38:24.25,romance?
759,00:38:25.33,00:38:25.33,">> Listen, I'm sorry, but from the beginning, he was sketchy."
760,00:38:28.25,00:38:28.25,Just shady.
761,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,From the beginning.
762,00:38:30.50,00:38:30.50,"And if I seemed insensitive to the whole deal, whatever."
763,00:38:32.29,00:38:32.29,But then he brings up things like this love at first sight
764,00:38:35.21,00:38:35.21,"stuff, I mean, it's just... oh, hell, I don't know, it's just"
765,00:38:37.58,00:38:37.58,random.
766,00:38:39.21,00:38:39.21,">> PROBST: Christina, is it unreal?"
767,00:38:41.21,00:38:41.21,">> I think anything's possible in life, but I feel very leery"
768,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,for Billy.
769,00:38:46.38,00:38:46.38,">> PROBST: Christina, you seem to have a soft spot for Billy."
770,00:38:50.79,00:38:50.79,>> I just don't want him to get hurt.
771,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,"I just hate when people get taken advantage of, and I"
772,00:38:55.42,00:38:55.42,just... I'm not into the dishonesty and to the
773,00:38:57.50,00:38:57.50,back-stabbing.
774,00:38:58.62,00:38:58.62,"I just really... I'm, you know, taking care of him,"
775,00:39:00.88,00:39:00.88,"at least, looking out for his best interests."
776,00:39:03.21,00:39:03.21,">> PROBST: Okay, there's been a lot said here tonight, and I'm"
777,00:39:06.04,00:39:06.04,very curious to see how it plays out.
778,00:39:08.12,00:39:08.12,It is time to vote.
779,00:39:09.33,00:39:09.33,"Ozzy, you're up."
780,00:39:23.29,00:39:23.29,">> If I can't trust you now, I won't be able to trust you"
781,00:39:26.25,00:39:26.25,later on in the game.
782,00:39:37.54,00:39:37.54,>> The only reason why I'm voting for you is because you
783,00:39:40.29,00:39:40.29,are the best player in the Aitutaki tribe.
784,00:39:50.33,00:39:50.33,are the best player in the Aitutaki tribe.
785,00:40:05.38,00:40:05.38,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
786,00:40:17.71,00:40:17.71,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
787,00:40:19.79,00:40:19.79,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
788,00:40:21.79,00:40:21.79,council area immediately.
789,00:40:22.96,00:40:22.96,I'll read the votes.
790,00:40:26.08,00:40:26.08,First vote: Billy.
791,00:40:31.67,00:40:31.67,Ozzy.
792,00:40:34.46,00:40:34.46,"One vote Billy, one vote Ozzy."
793,00:40:40.58,00:40:40.58,Billy.
794,00:40:43.08,00:40:43.08,"Two votes Billy, one vote Ozzy."
795,00:40:49.46,00:40:49.46,The second person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands-- Billy.

821,00:42:23.29,00:42:23.29,to live the dream of playing Survivor.
822,00:42:25.42,00:42:25.42,I got... I lived that dream for six days and I think it's
823,00:42:28.08,00:42:28.08,kind of cool that the heavy metal guy's getting eliminated
824,00:42:30.29,00:42:30.29,by some guy named Ozzy.
825,00:42:31.83,00:42:31.83,My biggest regret is I didn't play the way I wish I would of.
826,00:42:33.96,00:42:33.96,I didn't represent myself well in the beginning.
827,00:42:36.08,00:42:36.08,But I'm not going to regret anything because I still got to live the dream.
828,00:42:38.21,00:42:38.21,Too bad there wasn't a heavy metal tribe.  I think I would
829,00:42:39.12,00:42:39.12,have fit in better over there.
