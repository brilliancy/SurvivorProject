138,00:07:49.25,00:07:49.25,decided to make a chicken trap.
139,00:07:50.88,00:07:50.88,">> Once the chicken goes up top,we can pull the net and it will"

144,00:08:05.17,00:08:05.17,But a lot of the ideas she hasare coming from somebody who's
145,00:08:08.96,00:08:08.96,"not done a lot of camping, who'snot been in the outdoors a lot,"
146,00:08:11.54,00:08:11.54,so they don't make sense to me.
147,00:08:12.96,00:08:12.96,">> I think we should stretch it,like, wide across here and then"
148,00:08:16.21,00:08:16.21,"we'll create, like, a littletunnel."
149,00:08:21.25,00:08:21.25,>> Let's do it.

156,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,"I think it's because, for onething, she's a cop, and also"
157,00:08:39.29,00:08:39.29,just the fact that I'm tenyears younger than her and I
158,00:08:42.04,00:08:42.04,"understand, because if I had a14-year-old telling me what to"
159,00:08:45.08,00:08:45.08,"do, I'd probably get a littlepissed off myself."
160,00:08:55.12,00:08:55.12,"do, I'd probably get a littlepissed off myself."

179,00:09:55.62,00:09:55.62,We're really excited becauseI think everybody was pretty
180,00:09:58.08,00:09:58.08,hungry for somethingsubstantial.
181,00:10:00.08,00:10:00.08,Yul's a smart guy.
182,00:10:01.50,00:10:01.50,He's very intelligent and agood person to have on your

599,00:32:12.62,00:32:12.62,You don't feel bad?
600,00:32:14.04,00:32:14.04,>> It's all right.
601,00:32:15.29,00:32:15.29,He's not trustworthy.
602,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,"I don't feel bad, I reallydon't."
603,00:32:22.33,00:32:22.33,">> Once I figured it out, Ididn't want to be in this tribe"
604,00:32:24.75,00:32:24.75,anymore.
605,00:32:25.75,00:32:25.75,I think those two guys playedme for a patsy.
606,00:32:28.38,00:32:28.38,That whole taking your sweettime basically was a game.
607,00:32:31.79,00:32:31.79,"And once I'm gone, you're on theblock."
608,00:32:34.25,00:32:34.25,>> Exactly.
609,00:32:35.71,00:32:35.71,>> I hope they don't throwanother game just to try to get
610,00:32:37.75,00:32:37.75,rid of you.
611,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,"My only avenue right now, myonly shot, is with Christina."
612,00:32:43.29,00:32:43.29,"So, I just threw out therethat if I go now, she is going"
613,00:32:47.08,00:32:47.08,next.
614,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,"And it flies with her, like,she understands it."
615,00:32:52.88,00:32:52.88,I really don't.
616,00:32:53.79,00:32:53.79,">> No, Ozzy's playing thehardest."
617,00:32:55.46,00:32:55.46,">> Yeah, he really is."
618,00:32:57.00,00:32:57.00,"In my job, I see people all thetime, they're always in a lie."
619,00:32:58.79,00:32:58.79,And I had this feeling aboutOscar...
620,00:33:00.92,00:33:00.92,"I think Oscar's more of athreat right now, and he has"
621,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,been really playing everybody.
622,00:33:04.25,00:33:04.25,Why have we voted someone fromour own team off?
623,00:33:06.29,00:33:06.29,Let's be strong.
624,00:33:07.50,00:33:07.50,">> Yeah, absolutely."
625,00:33:10.50,00:33:10.50,>> I hope you do.
626,00:33:11.21,00:33:11.21,"Honestly, I hope you do."
627,00:33:20.62,00:33:20.62,"( speaking Spanish )>> No, girl."
628,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,We're on the same page.
629,00:33:30.67,00:33:30.67,"Look him in the eye, for real."
630,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,We're on the same page.
631,00:33:32.96,00:33:32.96,>> Okay.
632,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,>> Christina came up to me andshe asked me if Oscar and I had
633,00:33:37.92,00:33:37.92,any kind of alliance or anykind of an agreement.
634,00:33:40.62,00:33:40.62,And we don't.
635,00:33:41.79,00:33:41.79,But she asked that in Spanish.
636,00:33:44.08,00:33:44.08,>> I'm just kind of nervous.
637,00:33:46.17,00:33:46.17,Just wondering.
638,00:33:47.67,00:33:47.67,">> As a police officer, she hasto trust her partners because"
639,00:33:50.25,00:33:50.25,her life depends on that.
640,00:33:51.83,00:33:51.83,So I can imagine how a littlebit of that is coming into play
641,00:33:55.46,00:33:55.46,here.
642,00:33:56.83,00:33:56.83,But I hope she can trust mebecause I'm being honest with
643,00:33:59.21,00:33:59.21,her.
644,00:34:00.38,00:34:00.38,"I'm good with you, for sure."
645,00:34:01.79,00:34:01.79,So it's whatever we decide todo is whatever we decide to do.
646,00:34:04.88,00:34:04.88,">> Okay, sounds good."
647,00:34:10.54,00:34:10.54,>> I do think Billy is going tostir stuff up-- going behind my
648,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,"back and trying to switchpeople over, trying to"
649,00:34:15.42,00:34:15.42,"flip-flop so that, you know,maybe it's me because he wants"
650,00:34:18.33,00:34:18.33,me gone.
651,00:34:19.71,00:34:19.71,Christina is probably going tobe the most sympathetic.
652,00:34:22.38,00:34:22.38,"But if they want to throw meout, go ahead and do it because"
653,00:34:25.25,00:34:25.25,I know they're going to sufferreally bad if they lose me.
654,00:34:32.08,00:34:32.08,">> My best hope is thatsomehow, someway, Christina"
655,00:34:35.12,00:34:35.12,found a way to get inCecilia's ears and plant the
656,00:34:38.58,00:34:38.58,seed just long enough for her toswing a vote.
657,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,So all my chips are onChristina.
658,00:34:44.96,00:34:44.96,"My hand is a weak hand, but atleast I got one queen."
659,00:34:54.100,00:34:54.100,"My hand is a weak hand, but atleast I got one queen."
660,00:35:03.12,00:35:03.12,>> PROBST: Behind each of you isa torch.
661,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,"Go ahead and grab a torch,approach the flame and get"
662,00:35:07.17,00:35:07.17,fire.
663,00:35:08.67,00:35:08.67,This is part of the ritual oftribal council because in this
664,00:35:10.38,00:35:10.38,"game, fire represents yourlife."
665,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"As long as you have fire,you're still in the game."
666,00:35:16.54,00:35:16.54,"When your fire is gone, soyou are."
667,00:35:19.29,00:35:19.29,Have a seat.
668,00:35:26.29,00:35:26.29,"So, let's talk about the firstsix days."
669,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,"Billy, did a leader step up andsay, ""Here's what we're going"
670,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,"to do?"">> Well, initially, we just hit"
671,00:35:34.42,00:35:34.42,"the ground running, but littleby little, Ozzy emerged as the"
672,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,big voice.
673,00:35:39.79,00:35:39.79,This was his element; he's verymuch an outdoorsman.
674,00:35:42.88,00:35:42.88,">> PROBST: Christina, do youagree with Billy that Ozzy is"
675,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,the leader?
676,00:35:46.71,00:35:46.71,>> I don't feel that he's aleader.
677,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,I feel that he tries to takecontrol of certain things
678,00:35:52.08,00:35:52.08,because he does have experiencein this area; he feels a
679,00:35:55.08,00:35:55.08,little more confident in that.
680,00:35:56.46,00:35:56.46,">> PROBST: Ozzy, do you thinkyou're the leader?"
681,00:35:58.58,00:35:58.58,">> No, I don't think I'm theleader."
682,00:36:00.75,00:36:00.75,There are certain things that Ihave specific knowledge of
683,00:36:03.08,00:36:03.08,"that if I don't voice myopinion, then it's going to get"
684,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,done wrong.
685,00:36:07.58,00:36:07.58,But I think that our strongestthing is we can all get things
686,00:36:11.25,00:36:11.25,done as a team and it gives usa lot of pride because we know
687,00:36:15.75,00:36:15.75,"that if we work hard, we'regoing to be stronger than"
688,00:36:18.29,00:36:18.29,anybody else.
689,00:36:19.96,00:36:19.96,>> PROBST: Do you think thistribe represented themselves
690,00:36:22.25,00:36:22.25,well in the last challenge?
691,00:36:23.25,00:36:23.25,">> No, the last challenge-- notreally."
692,00:36:26.25,00:36:26.25,">> PROBST: Billy, when I askedthe question, you're like,"
693,00:36:28.50,00:36:28.50,"""Oh, come on."""
694,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,">> Actually, a lot of our losshad to do with me."
695,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,J.P. and Ozzy decided I'mhurting the tribe way too much
696,00:36:35.58,00:36:35.58,and so they were going to throwthe challenge.
697,00:36:38.21,00:36:38.21,>> PROBST: You believe theythrew the challenge?
698,00:36:39.54,00:36:39.54,>> I know they threw thechallenge.
699,00:36:41.75,00:36:41.75,">> PROBST: J.P., you threw achallenge?"
700,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,"With only five tribe members,you're already willing to lose"
701,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,somebody?
702,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,">> At this point, yeah."
703,00:36:48.75,00:36:48.75,I don't believe in havingto carry weight of somebody
704,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,who I don't believe is trustingand who doesn't carry the
705,00:36:55.50,00:36:55.50,workload.
706,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,">> PROBST: Billy, are yousurprised to hear that trust is"
707,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,an issue?
708,00:37:00.38,00:37:00.38,">> I understand that a gameis being played, but I fell"
709,00:37:02.21,00:37:02.21,"into a classic trap, and nowI'm on the chopping block."
710,00:37:04.88,00:37:04.88,">> No, no, no, no, no."
711,00:37:06.38,00:37:06.38,I hate the way he's trying tosound like he's a victim right
712,00:37:08.29,00:37:08.29,now.
713,00:37:09.08,00:37:09.08,>> I was a player.
714,00:37:10.12,00:37:10.12,I'm not saying I'm a victim.
715,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,>> And you know how to say thegreatest things to make
716,00:37:12.88,00:37:12.88,yourself look so damn good.
717,00:37:14.42,00:37:14.42,">> I'm clawing and scratchingor whatever-- yeah, I'm playing"
718,00:37:15.62,00:37:15.62,the game.
719,00:37:16.46,00:37:16.46,That's my dream.
720,00:37:17.79,00:37:17.79,>> Part of the game is trying toto involve yourself.
721,00:37:19.46,00:37:19.46,That way people find youvaluable...
722,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,>> I'm still talking here.

729,00:37:29.08,00:37:29.08,"So, like I was saying, I'mplaying the game."
730,00:37:31.29,00:37:31.29,That's what I came here to do.
731,00:37:32.08,00:37:32.08,My prize isn't even the milliondollars.
732,00:37:34.25,00:37:34.25,"My prize was that I fell inlove in this game, love at"

739,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,"After the last challenge, wesort of mouthed the words ""I"
740,00:37:47.17,00:37:47.17,"love you"" to one another, andso that was my prize."
741,00:37:49.12,00:37:49.12,My prize was her.

745,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,happened.
746,00:37:58.62,00:37:58.62,But what would she base feelingthe same way you feel on?
747,00:38:01.71,00:38:01.71,">> I think it's just, you know,love at first sight."
748,00:38:03.79,00:38:03.79,I think it's just a rapportthing.

750,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,>> I'm dead serious.

754,00:38:17.75,00:38:17.75,"But, I mean, I'm not lookingfor it."
755,00:38:19.75,00:38:19.75,It's new to me as it is you.

759,00:38:28.25,00:38:28.25,Just shady.
760,00:38:29.08,00:38:29.08,From the beginning.
761,00:38:30.50,00:38:30.50,"And if I seemed insensitive tothe whole deal, whatever."
762,00:38:32.29,00:38:32.29,But then he brings up thingslike this love at first sight
763,00:38:35.21,00:38:35.21,"stuff, I mean, it's just... oh,hell, I don't know, it's just"

822,00:42:28.08,00:42:28.08,kind of cool that the heavymetal guy's getting eliminated

826,00:42:36.08,00:42:36.08,But I'm not going to regretanything because I still got tolive the dream.
827,00:42:38.21,00:42:38.21,Too bad there wasn't aheavy metal tribe.  I think Iwould
828,00:42:39.12,00:42:39.12,have fit in better over there.
