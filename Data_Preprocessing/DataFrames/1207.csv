36,00:02:27.04,00:02:27.04,history they were split into four tribes.

38,00:02:35.25,00:02:35.25,versus the older women. This is Exile Island.
39,00:02:38.75,00:02:38.75,Throughout this game tribe members will be banished to this
40,00:02:41.33,00:02:41.33,island. Wasting not time the tribes
41,00:02:43.38,00:02:43.38,faced off in their first challenge.
42,00:02:45.38,00:02:45.38,>> Yeah. >> Let's get it on.

48,00:03:10.12,00:03:10.12,Then another twist was revealed. Hidden somewhere on this island
49,00:03:14.08,00:03:14.08,is an immunity idol. Along the way you'll be given

58,00:03:42.50,00:03:42.50,feel a little bit of energy. >> Our tribe's just hysterical.
59,00:03:45.21,00:03:45.21,"I mean, we all established within two hours of being here"
60,00:03:47.67,00:03:47.67,we don't have a clue what we were doing.
61,00:03:50.17,00:03:50.17,"That's a shelter right there, gentlemen."

64,00:03:57.62,00:03:57.62,"before seen footage, it was a struggle just to open a coconut."

66,00:04:03.71,00:04:03.71,>> I hear it. Let's crack one open.
67,00:04:05.75,00:04:05.75,>> We should. Doesn't seem like very much.
68,00:04:10.83,00:04:10.83,">> Oh, no. >> The machete is a bit tricky."
69,00:04:15.25,00:04:15.25,I'm shocked by how badly I'm doing opening coconuts.
70,00:04:20.38,00:04:20.38,"Damn. >> No, wait, wait, wait."
71,00:04:23.50,00:04:23.50,Go like... >> Really?
72,00:04:26.67,00:04:26.67,I always open coconuts from the front.
73,00:04:29.04,00:04:29.04,>> We were all expecting I think a male to be here to help us out
74,00:04:32.17,00:04:32.17,"with that department. >> All right, you try."
75,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,We'll take turns. >> Just don't come too close to
76,00:04:36.67,00:04:36.67,me because I'm dangerous with a machete.
77,00:04:40.08,00:04:40.08,"Ready... >> Oh, that's it."
78,00:04:43.71,00:04:43.71,Now do that against the wood. >> I love the machete.
79,00:04:46.71,00:04:46.71,I worked construction for a summer and favorite part was
80,00:04:49.08,00:04:49.08,demolition. And maybe that's that side of me
81,00:04:51.21,00:04:51.21,"coming out. >> Gosh, this is so easy."
82,00:04:54.21,00:04:54.21,>> Yeah. >> Gosh.
83,00:04:56.21,00:04:56.21,>> Those little coconuts-- they are hard.
84,00:04:58.42,00:04:58.42,But I love taking that machete and just going to town on
85,00:05:01.21,00:05:01.21,whatever I can. And it worked.
86,00:05:03.88,00:05:03.88,I broke some coconuts. >> Our first coconut.
87,00:05:06.75,00:05:06.75,"We drink from the same coconut, man, yeah."
88,00:05:10.88,00:05:10.88,">> PROBST: At the older men's camp, everything was under"
89,00:05:13.25,00:05:13.25,control... >> That's the best smelling
90,00:05:15.12,00:05:15.12,stinking fire I've seen in a long time.
91,00:05:17.58,00:05:17.58,>> PROBST: ...leaving time for Dan the astronaut and Terry the
92,00:05:20.46,00:05:20.46,fighter pilot to make a pact. >> I'll never lie to you.
93,00:05:23.04,00:05:23.04,>> Okay. >> I expect you to never lie to
94,00:05:25.42,00:05:25.42,me. >> I'll shake on that.
95,00:05:27.25,00:05:27.25,">> Yeah? >> Yeah, yeah."
96,00:05:29.21,00:05:29.21,">> PROBST: Shane however, was wearing down quickly."
97,00:05:31.79,00:05:31.79,>> We're here... all four of us don't know to get the water.
98,00:05:34.46,00:05:34.46,All four of us don't need to head to the path to find the mud
99,00:05:37.42,00:05:37.42,"chute. I'm exhausted, I haven't had a"
100,00:05:39.54,00:05:39.54,"cigarette, and I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day for"
101,00:05:42.21,00:05:42.21,20 years and I haven't had a cigarette in like 31 hours.
102,00:05:45.79,00:05:45.79,"I mean, I'm just at the end of my rope."
103,00:05:50.12,00:05:50.12,">> PROBST: Later that day, Tina made a valuable discovery."
104,00:05:54.54,00:05:54.54,>> Holy criminy. An oyster.
105,00:06:01.54,00:06:01.54,Ah.oyster. I just caught an oyster.
106,00:06:04.46,00:06:04.46,It's just like embedded in there.
107,00:06:06.75,00:06:06.75,That thing has been embedded in there for millions of years I
108,00:06:09.29,00:06:09.29,"think. Oh, my God, look at that."
109,00:06:14.67,00:06:14.67,That is a lot of flesh. That's probably enough to keep
110,00:06:18.50,00:06:18.50,me going for the day. I think it was the best oyster I
111,00:06:25.04,00:06:25.04,ever had in my life. It was beautiful.
112,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,I love oysters. (purring)
113,00:06:31.29,00:06:31.29,"Oh, there's another one. And another one."
114,00:06:36.12,00:06:36.12,Got a couple lunches here. I did not tell anyone that I
115,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,found oysters. I intend to keep them all for
116,00:06:43.62,00:06:43.62,myself. And if you saw where I found
117,00:06:46.58,00:06:46.58,"them, there's no way they're going to know they're there."
118,00:06:51.38,00:06:51.38,">> PROBST: That night at the older men's camp, Bruce had"
119,00:06:55.17,00:06:55.17,trouble sleeping and he put his idle time to good use.
120,00:06:59.00,00:06:59.00,>> Sometimes when things are bothering me late at night I
121,00:07:01.17,00:07:01.17,like to break away and just do my karate.
122,00:07:10.33,00:07:10.33,"My karate practice is very important to me, 'cause it"
123,00:07:13.62,00:07:13.62,always keeps me in shape and keeps my mind focused.
124,00:07:19.08,00:07:19.08,I take my mind off everything else.
125,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,I focus on each karate move. Usually executing a kata--
126,00:07:26.25,00:07:26.25,my ancient form movement. Usually fighting three or four
127,00:07:29.04,00:07:29.04,imaginary opponents. Sometimes I practice 100 at a
128,00:07:31.25,00:07:31.25,time. >> Bruce wants to come down here
129,00:07:56.21,00:07:56.21,and get his Miyagi on in front of the water and karate down.
130,00:08:00.92,00:08:00.92,I'm cool with that. I like odd people.
131,00:08:03.88,00:08:03.88,"I think he's got a lot of anxiety about being here and,"
132,00:08:06.88,00:08:06.88,"uh, I think that's probably how he, you know, gets it out."
133,00:08:12.25,00:08:12.25,">> When I'm doing my kata, I always feel like I'm trying to"
134,00:08:15.42,00:08:15.42,destroy my opponent. So I have to keep that karate as
135,00:08:18.88,00:08:18.88,"part of my game plan. >> PROBST: On day two, Misty"
136,00:08:24.12,00:08:24.12,came up with a plan regarding the hidden immunity idol.
137,00:08:26.92,00:08:26.92,>> I'm the first one voted off should we not win.
138,00:08:29.79,00:08:29.79,Which would make sense if I was in their shoes.
139,00:08:33.21,00:08:33.21,"So when I see my tribe mates at the next immunity challenge,"
140,00:08:36.62,00:08:36.62,I'll trick them into thinking that I found the immunity idol.
141,00:08:41.33,00:08:41.33,">> PROBST: At the first immunity challenge, Misty rejoined her"
142,00:08:45.08,00:08:45.08,tribe and implied that she had found the idol.
143,00:08:47.83,00:08:47.83,"So, Misty, how's Exile Island? >> You told us there was an"
144,00:08:50.88,00:08:50.88,"immunity idol on there and you told us where it was, so..."
145,00:08:53.62,00:08:53.62,>> PROBST: So you spent a little time looking for it?
146,00:08:57.42,00:08:57.42,">> Enough. >> PROBST: During the challenge,"
147,00:09:02.38,00:09:02.38,the younger men fell behind early.
148,00:09:04.58,00:09:04.58,Young guys still trying to get that rope free.
149,00:09:08.17,00:09:08.17,Young guys in serious trouble. While the younger women and the
150,00:09:11.67,00:09:11.67,older men cruised. Younger women have immunity!
151,00:09:16.33,00:09:16.33,"Older men win immunity. >> We got it, we got it, we got"
152,00:09:19.58,00:09:19.58,it. >> PROBST: Down to two tribes.
153,00:09:21.38,00:09:21.38,"One immunity left. Older women, younger guys."
154,00:09:24.08,00:09:24.08,"In the end, the younger men passed the older women for the"
155,00:09:26.54,00:09:26.54,"last piece of immunity. >> Come on, baby."
156,00:09:29.25,00:09:29.25,>> PROBST: Younger men win immunity!
157,00:09:31.62,00:09:31.62,Older women going to Tribal Council.

159,00:09:39.58,00:09:39.58,"first time. >> I love it, you guys."
160,00:09:42.42,00:09:42.42,"This is beautiful. >> Well, when Misty came back"
161,00:09:45.38,00:09:45.38,"from Exile Island, we were extremely anxious to know if"
162,00:09:48.71,00:09:48.71,she'd gotten the idol or not. >> What did you do out there?
163,00:09:52.38,00:09:52.38,You were just like... >> Digging.
164,00:09:55.04,00:09:55.04,>> She was a digging fool. >> You digged both days?
165,00:09:57.67,00:09:57.67,>> I dig... I dug... yeah. Until yesterday afternoon.
166,00:10:00.71,00:10:00.71,">> Like digging? >> Yeah, my whole focus was"
167,00:10:03.38,00:10:03.38,"like, dig, dig, dig. >> And it worked out, I mean,"
168,00:10:07.04,00:10:07.04,"you said you found it, so... >> It's that whole don't tell"
169,00:10:09.92,00:10:09.92,anyone if you have it or don't have it thing.
170,00:10:12.29,00:10:12.29,>> I don't know why you need to keep it quiet.
171,00:10:14.83,00:10:14.83,>> I tried to trick them into thinking that I had the immunity
172,00:10:17.04,00:10:17.04,idol. I think Courtney called my
173,00:10:19.04,00:10:19.04,bluff-- rightly so. I think she's very good at
174,00:10:21.25,00:10:21.25,deceiving people. So I think she could see it in
175,00:10:24.96,00:10:24.96,"me, 'cause I'm really not that great at it."
176,00:10:27.12,00:10:27.12,>> How long did you have to dig before you found it?
177,00:10:29.50,00:10:29.50,>> All day. >> You found it today?
178,00:10:31.92,00:10:31.92,">> No, it was yesterday and I was sitting there..."
179,00:10:34.17,00:10:34.17,"Yeah, no, girl. You think?"
180,00:10:39.08,00:10:39.08,>> I don't know-- she had a good story.
181,00:10:42.50,00:10:42.50,She could have it. I don't want her to pull this
182,00:10:45.17,00:10:45.17,"out of her hat later down the road, when immunity could be"
183,00:10:48.04,00:10:48.04,really worth something. >> Misty came back and told all
184,00:10:52.08,00:10:52.08,of us that she had found the immunity idol.
185,00:10:54.54,00:10:54.54,"And I didn't buy it for a second, but the other girls"
186,00:10:57.25,00:10:57.25,seemed to buy it. >> PROBST: Facing Tribal
187,00:11:01.79,00:11:01.79,"Council, Tina's tribemates were put off by her isolated"
188,00:11:04.08,00:11:04.08,behavior. But Tina's behavior was
189,00:11:14.12,00:11:14.12,misunderstood. >> I wrote this in the sand for

202,00:12:14.96,00:12:14.96,Tina's outdoor skills were not enough to save her and she
203,00:12:17.67,00:12:17.67,became the first person voted off Survivor: Exile Island.

260,00:16:09.54,00:16:09.54,pulled out a narrow victory. La Mina wins reward!
261,00:16:15.42,00:16:15.42,Arriving at the new Casaya beach after the challenge...
262,00:16:19.96,00:16:19.96,"...Shane quickly set up an alliance with Danielle, Courtney"
263,00:16:22.12,00:16:22.12,and Aras. >> I go on the beach and I was

275,00:17:09.79,00:17:09.79,don't have water because we don't have fire.
276,00:17:13.42,00:17:13.42,">> Just that little bit is, like, so refreshing."

278,00:17:20.75,00:17:20.75,Courtney and Daniel have not had water for five days.
279,00:17:23.50,00:17:23.50,Maybe these people can rise to the occasions.
280,00:17:25.58,00:17:25.58,I know they're all competitors. Maybe that's gonna happen.
281,00:17:28.04,00:17:28.04,I don't know. We'll just have to see.

288,00:17:59.88,00:17:59.88,>> Did you try to go back down with the mask?
289,00:18:02.67,00:18:02.67,>> Yeah. It was so deep. >> I'm very frustrated about the
290,00:18:04.83,00:18:04.83,spear. I had no doubt in my mind we
291,00:18:07.33,00:18:07.33,would be eating tons of fish if we had that spear.

303,00:18:48.00,00:18:48.00,Bruce returned from Exile Island and watched as Melinda became
304,00:18:52.08,00:18:52.08,the second person voted off Survivor: Exile Island.
305,00:18:55.62,00:18:55.62,"Melinda, the tribe has spoken. >> It's a hundred-times harder"
306,00:18:59.75,00:18:59.75,than you could ever possibly think it's gonna be.
307,00:19:02.25,00:19:02.25,"Sure, you know, it's all gonna be over in 39 days, but 39 days"
308,00:19:05.62,00:19:05.62,sounds like a lot less time when you're at home on the couch than
309,00:19:09.54,00:19:09.54,when you're laying on bamboo. >> PROBST: That night after
310,00:19:13.08,00:19:13.08,"Tribal Council, Bruce became a member of the Casaya Tribe,"
311,00:19:16.25,00:19:16.25,and his impact was immediate. >> So this is what we're gonna
312,00:19:19.17,00:19:19.17,"do: we're gonna filter water through three T-shirts, double"
313,00:19:22.12,00:19:22.12,layer. That's gonna be 90% pure water.

315,00:19:29.25,00:19:29.25,the top of the tribe. It's the best bottle so far.

317,00:19:37.25,00:19:37.25,acknowledged Bruce's positive effect on the tribe.

320,00:19:44.08,00:19:44.08,>> Bruce is a savior. >> PROBST: But his presence
321,00:19:45.88,00:19:45.88,wasn't enough to beat out a sure-handed La Mina.
322,00:19:48.62,00:19:48.62,">> Fire at will. >> Come on. Get it, Aras!"
323,00:19:54.00,00:19:54.00,>> PROBST: Terry makes an unbelievable catch!
324,00:19:57.08,00:19:57.08,La Mina wins reward! La Mina was on a roll.

326,00:20:03.50,00:20:03.50,sent a member of the losers to Exile Island.
327,00:20:06.21,00:20:06.21,(all whispering) Who are you sending?
328,00:20:10.04,00:20:10.04,">> Bruce, we're sending you back."
329,00:20:12.33,00:20:12.33,>> PROBST: And Bruce was forced to return to Exile Island.

347,00:21:06.25,00:21:06.25,We don't have a team. It's the reason why we're not
348,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,winning. >> I've seen four people walk
349,00:21:17.54,00:21:17.54,down to the beach by themselves. What am I supposed to do?

352,00:21:24.25,00:21:24.25,You're bummed out 'cause you're on the outside.
353,00:21:26.04,00:21:26.04,">> No, I'm bummed out that you guys act like seventh-grade"

362,00:21:42.08,00:21:42.08,fault. I'm saying you have a negative
363,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,"attitude and it drains on me, so I stay away from you."

369,00:22:06.54,00:22:06.54,so he just comes up with different reasons to be upset
370,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17,with people. >> Instead of continuing this

562,00:33:12.54,00:33:12.54,So they didn't do anything wrong.
563,00:33:16.83,00:33:16.83,">> PROBST: The next morning, the fire caused sparks at Casaya in"
564,00:33:20.46,00:33:20.46,this new scene from day 12. >> Pretty much everybody but
565,00:33:30.04,00:33:30.04,Bobby is working. Bobby doesn't ever catch any
566,00:33:33.04,00:33:33.04,"food, never gets any water. He doesn't even try to help get"
567,00:33:37.38,00:33:37.38,"the fire going. For his size, he should have..."
568,00:33:39.75,00:33:39.75,I feel like he should have more strength.
569,00:33:46.42,00:33:46.42,(laughing) (yawning)
570,00:34:03.04,00:34:03.04,>> Bob. Bob...
571,00:34:08.25,00:34:08.25,"You feel okay? >> Yeah, I'm cool."
572,00:34:45.62,00:34:45.62,">> Yeah. Danielle, apparently in her"
573,00:34:48.92,00:34:48.92,"fatigued and dumb state, apparently thought I was"
574,00:34:52.75,00:34:52.75,serious. She apparently thought I really
575,00:34:54.79,00:34:54.79,couldn't figure out that I was supposed to be putting the stick
576,00:34:57.29,00:34:57.29,on the fire. She apparently thought I was
577,00:35:07.83,00:35:07.83,serious. Just like completely over her
578,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,"head, like all this stuff is just, like... just gone."
579,00:35:13.96,00:35:13.96,">> Here, let me do it, I'll do it."
580,00:35:16.58,00:35:16.58,"Bobby takes a twig. ""Where do I put this?"""
581,00:35:18.75,00:35:18.75,"And he did it, he said it, like, six times."
582,00:35:21.38,00:35:21.38,"Finally, I got so aggravated, I go, ""You know what, Bobby, I'll"
583,00:35:24.00,00:35:24.00,"do it. Forget it, forget it, go back to"
584,00:35:26.29,00:35:26.29,"bed."" We figured he's a guy, I mean,"
585,00:35:28.88,00:35:28.88,"guys should be good at that, that he would get it going."
586,00:35:31.58,00:35:31.58,And he didn't give me anything. He just picked up and went back
587,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,"to bed. I don't know, me and him just"
588,00:35:37.33,00:35:37.33,don't click. We just don't get along.
589,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,">> PROBST: In this new footage from day 12 at Casaya, soap from"
590,00:35:50.62,00:35:50.62,an earlier reward was finally put to use.
591,00:35:57.42,00:35:57.42,>> Thank God for that bar of soap.
592,00:36:00.21,00:36:00.21,">> I mean, it almost makes you feel like a different person."
593,00:36:03.96,00:36:03.96,"We won in the reward challenge, three bars of soap, a"
594,00:36:07.08,00:36:07.08,back scrubber... After ten days of not washing
595,00:36:10.71,00:36:10.71,"any part of your body, it felt great."
596,00:36:13.79,00:36:13.79,>> Danielle and I just wanted to have a girls' bar of soap and a
597,00:36:17.25,00:36:17.25,"guys' bar of soap. So far, Bruce has been the first"
598,00:36:20.08,00:36:20.08,"one to use the backscratcher, you know."
599,00:36:22.67,00:36:22.67,"And Bruce has the soap, and it's like, covered in black"
600,00:36:25.12,00:36:25.12,"hairs. And just to let the boys know,"
601,00:36:27.88,00:36:27.88,the soap that's wrapped like this is the girls' soap.
602,00:36:32.75,00:36:32.75,I get kind of grossed out easily.
603,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,">> What, you want the girls to use a bar and the boys to use a"
604,00:36:37.96,00:36:37.96,"bar? >> Yeah, the girls to use a bar"
605,00:36:40.42,00:36:40.42,"and the guys to use a bar. >> Well, the guys have two bars."
606,00:36:43.25,00:36:43.25,"We'll use one. >> We're out here, we're like"
607,00:36:46.38,00:36:46.38,"sharing everything. Courtney's, like, this is the"
608,00:36:48.92,00:36:48.92,"girls' soap, you know what I mean?"
609,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,"And what I wanted to do was look at her and go, ""That's the"
610,00:36:54.88,00:36:54.88,"lunatics' soap."" >> Ugh!"
611,00:36:59.00,00:36:59.00,>> It's nasty. >> PROBST: At the reward
612,00:37:02.54,00:37:02.54,"challenge, the tribes competed for food and wine."
613,00:37:05.42,00:37:05.42,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: La Mina took the"
614,00:37:07.88,00:37:07.88,lead. Terry with a nice grab.
615,00:37:09.92,00:37:09.92,Bruce really having trouble. But Sally struggled and Bobby
616,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,chopped his way to victory for Casaya.
617,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,Casaya wins reward! >> We eat!
618,00:37:18.50,00:37:18.50,>> PROBST: And they won a bounty of fish and wine before they
619,00:37:22.12,00:37:22.12,picked Terry to go back to Exile Island.
620,00:37:24.58,00:37:24.58,">> Good luck, Terry. Casaya returned to a waterlogged"
621,00:37:30.08,00:37:30.08,camp. >> This is a nightmare.
622,00:37:32.62,00:37:32.62,">> We have a ton of fish, but we can't cook it."
623,00:37:35.92,00:37:35.92,Everything is wet. >> PROBST: But even without
624,00:37:38.42,00:37:38.42,"fire, they manage to make the most of their reward."
625,00:37:41.54,00:37:41.54,>> I've never eaten raw fish. I hope I don't wake up in the
626,00:37:44.58,00:37:44.58,morning with some kind of sickness or something.
627,00:37:48.12,00:37:48.12,"(thunder) >> PROBST: That night, Bruce and"
628,00:37:50.54,00:37:50.54,Bobby spent the night in the outhouse with each other and the
629,00:37:53.62,00:37:53.62,"last bottle of wine. In the morning, the missing"
630,00:37:59.46,00:37:59.46,bottle did not go unnoticed. >> Someone would have to pour
631,00:38:06.12,00:38:06.12,it down my throat for me to drink the last bottle of wine
632,00:38:09.04,00:38:09.04,"that we as a tribe won. >> You really made a bad, bad"
633,00:38:11.50,00:38:11.50,call. >> I don't feel bad that I stole
634,00:38:14.17,00:38:14.17,"your wine. Like, I feel bad that I deprived"
635,00:38:16.25,00:38:16.25,"them of wine, but I have no hard feelings whatsoever about the"
636,00:38:18.92,00:38:18.92,fact that you've been deprived of wine.
637,00:38:22.00,00:38:22.00,>> PROBST: At the immunity challenge...
638,00:38:24.04,00:38:24.04,La Mina with a big lead. La Mina finally put an end to
639,00:38:26.62,00:38:26.62,their losing streak. La Mina has it!
640,00:38:29.75,00:38:29.75,"La Mina wins immunity! At Tribal Council, Bobby paid"
641,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,the price for drinking the last of the wine and he was the fifth
642,00:38:39.79,00:38:39.79,person voted off Survivor: Exile Island.
643,00:38:43.08,00:38:43.08,"Bobby, the tribe has spoken. >> I was kind of mixed up with a"
644,00:38:48.08,00:38:48.08,"bunch of little jokers that, you know, pretty much had it in for"
645,00:38:51.00,00:38:51.00,"me from the get-go. In a game like this, you get"
646,00:38:53.46,00:38:53.46,"enough weaklings together, they can form a pretty strong block."
647,00:38:58.04,00:38:58.04,">> PROBST: The following morning, Shane wanted out of the"
648,00:39:00.21,00:39:00.21,alliance he had built on the promise of his son's name.
649,00:39:03.21,00:39:03.21,>> I want to ask you guys if I can take my son's name...
650,00:39:06.21,00:39:06.21,>> Done. >> Done?
651,00:39:07.54,00:39:07.54,">> PROBST: Fed up with Shane's antics, the girls agreed"
652,00:39:09.54,00:39:09.54,"immediately. >> Well, if that's how you feel"
653,00:39:11.75,00:39:11.75,"about it, then fine. Get out of the alliance, you're"
654,00:39:13.83,00:39:13.83,off anyway. See ya later. Bye.
655,00:39:16.58,00:39:16.58,"Out. >> PROBST: Meanwhile, at La"
656,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,"Mina, Sally knew her days were numbered."
657,00:39:22.96,00:39:22.96,>> It's been a rough couple of days.
658,00:39:25.25,00:39:25.25,The four guys were kind of doing like a boys club thing.
659,00:39:28.25,00:39:28.25,But I think it's short sighted. >> PROBST: At a high stakes
660,00:39:31.17,00:39:31.17,"challenge for reward and immunity, there was an"
661,00:39:33.75,00:39:33.75,unexpected twist. The person you send to Exile
662,00:39:36.71,00:39:36.71,Island will not go to Tribal Council tonight.
663,00:39:39.62,00:39:39.62,That means they cannot be voted out.
664,00:39:43.00,00:39:43.00,Terry's back with the last puzzle piece.
665,00:39:45.08,00:39:45.08,La Mina took an early lead. Dan and Sally quickly getting to
666,00:39:47.92,00:39:47.92,work. But when Dan and Sally struggled
667,00:39:50.62,00:39:50.62,"on the puzzle, Casaya... >> Step on it! Step on it!"
668,00:39:54.17,00:39:54.17,>> PROBST: ...put the pieces together for the victory.
669,00:39:56.62,00:39:56.62,"Casaya wins reward and immunity! Casaya, who's it going to be?"
670,00:40:02.08,00:40:02.08,>> Sally. >> PROBST: When Casaya chose
671,00:40:04.58,00:40:04.58,"Sally to go to Exile Island, it meant the end of the game for"
672,00:40:07.54,00:40:07.54,one of the remaining four La Mina men.
673,00:40:12.42,00:40:12.42,>> I'm so happy right now. >> PROBST: Casaya reveled in the
674,00:40:15.21,00:40:15.21,glory of a Panamanian feast. >> I just ate everything in
675,00:40:18.12,00:40:18.12,sight. >> PROBST: With bellies full of
676,00:40:20.50,00:40:20.50,"food, their tribal wounds began to heal."
677,00:40:22.75,00:40:22.75,">> And I apologize, okay? >> Accepted."
678,00:40:25.79,00:40:25.79,>> PROBST: But Cirie was not happy with the rediscovered
679,00:40:28.38,00:40:28.38,"harmony. >> I almost wanted to lose,"
680,00:40:30.38,00:40:30.38,because I really felt that Shane was going.
681,00:40:33.04,00:40:33.04,But now... everybody's all in love again.
682,00:40:36.21,00:40:36.21,Damn! >> PROBST: With Sally safe on
683,00:40:40.38,00:40:40.38,"Exile Island, the La Mina men had to make a difficult"
684,00:40:43.96,00:40:43.96,decision at Tribal Council. And Dan became the sixth person
685,00:40:47.12,00:40:47.12,voted off Survivor: Exile Island.
686,00:40:49.58,00:40:49.58,"Dan, the tribe has spoken. >> As the days went on, even"
687,00:40:53.83,00:40:53.83,"though the hunger grew and the deprivation grew, the sense of"
688,00:40:57.04,00:40:57.04,being part of nature also grew. It was beautiful and I was not
689,00:41:01.00,00:41:01.00,"ready to go home. >> PROBST: Where 16 once stood,"
690,00:41:13.46,00:41:13.46,only ten remain. What will happen as the rewards
691,00:41:17.71,00:41:17.71,get bigger? The risks get greater?
692,00:41:21.50,00:41:21.50,"Whoa, easy guys. >> We have a medical emergency."
693,00:41:29.21,00:41:29.21,>> PROBST: And one could be forced to leave the game.
