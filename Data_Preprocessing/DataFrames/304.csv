1,00:00:01.30,00:00:01.30,>> JEFF PROBST: Previously on  Survivor...
2,00:00:03.87,00:00:03.87,"At Samburu, the gap between young and old widened when Silas"
3,00:00:06.43,00:00:06.43,took sides with his own generation.
4,00:00:08.33,00:00:08.33,>> Straddling the fence is over. I am no longer with the older
5,00:00:10.93,00:00:10.93,"people, and I don't care if they know that."
6,00:00:12.53,00:00:12.53,">> 'Cause they're immature, they're trying to get under"
7,00:00:14.67,00:00:14.67,"their skin, and it's working. >> PROBST: Boran rebounded from"
8,00:00:16.60,00:00:16.60,"their losing streak, winning their first reward challenge."
9,00:00:20.60,00:00:20.60,"Then they bared all to claim immunity, sending Samburu to"
10,00:00:24.60,00:00:24.60,"their first Tribal Council, where the young-old split caused"
11,00:00:27.83,00:00:27.83,a deadlock tie between Lindsey and Carl.
12,00:00:30.83,00:00:30.83,"With no previous votes between them to break the tie, a sudden-"
13,00:00:33.67,00:00:33.67,death competition sent Carl packing.
14,00:00:36.00,00:00:36.00,>> PROBST: True. The tribe has spoken.
15,00:00:38.87,00:00:38.87,And Lindsey returned to camp with four votes.
16,00:00:41.77,00:00:41.77,"13 are left. Tonight, one more will go."
17,00:00:45.70,00:00:45.70,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> All right, make that fire"
18,00:02:05.13,00:02:05.13,big. >> Big fire.
19,00:02:06.97,00:02:06.97,Torches by the flag. >> Yeah.
20,00:02:09.43,00:02:09.43,">> Well, we had our first Tribal Council."
21,00:02:11.33,00:02:11.33,We voted Doc off. All eight of us went in there
22,00:02:13.80,00:02:13.80,and split four and four. >> I am still here and I am
23,00:02:15.67,00:02:15.67,smiling big. >> Anything could've happened.
24,00:02:18.87,00:02:18.87,"It was literally a crapshoot. Whoever won, uh, won that Tribal"
25,00:02:23.37,00:02:23.37,"Council basically won the majority, and basically more or"
26,00:02:26.93,00:02:26.93,less took over the tribe. >> Here's the deal.
27,00:02:29.97,00:02:29.97,"If you guys want to go to the water hole or whatever, we"
28,00:02:32.43,00:02:32.43,"understand that. But, I mean, just, you know, let"
29,00:02:35.13,00:02:35.13,"us know, and we'll go-- we'll either go as a group or you guys"
30,00:02:37.03,00:02:37.03,can go. >> And the people that get up
31,00:02:39.40,00:02:39.40,right away need to just be patient for those that need a
32,00:02:41.90,00:02:41.90,"little extra sleep, that may have stayed up a little bit"
33,00:02:43.67,00:02:43.67,later. >> By the time I got back to
34,00:02:45.80,00:02:45.80,"camp I felt really angry, just like, it all hit me just like,"
35,00:02:48.80,00:02:48.80,"oh, my God, they picked me, those bastards!"
36,00:02:52.67,00:02:52.67,You know? And I just got really angry and I just wanted to lash
37,00:02:55.20,00:02:55.20,out and just be mad at those three people for voting for me.
38,00:02:58.77,00:02:58.77,Seriously pumped to get an award tomorrow.
39,00:03:00.90,00:03:00.90,"Seriously pumped, and trust me, when I'm pumped you don't want"
40,00:03:03.90,00:03:03.90,"to ... with me. Don't underestimate me, people."
41,00:03:08.30,00:03:08.30,">> The thing about Lindsey, of course she handled it wrong."
42,00:03:11.23,00:03:11.23,"We needed their support and we needed to be kind to them, but,"
43,00:03:14.90,00:03:14.90,"boy, she really just kind of flew off, you know, the deep"
44,00:03:17.23,00:03:17.23,end. >> Trust me.
45,00:03:19.37,00:03:19.37,">> It was difficult hearing comments when they came back,"
46,00:03:22.37,00:03:22.37,"like Lindsey was saying, ""They ... with the wrong girl,"""
47,00:03:25.47,00:03:25.47,"and comments like, ""Okay, so come here, team,"" and they"
48,00:03:28.57,00:03:28.57,really meant the four of them. >> Tomorrow morning we are like
49,00:03:32.13,00:03:32.13,a full-on team again. So let's just have one more
50,00:03:33.90,00:03:33.90,moment. >> It was no accident because I
51,00:03:37.37,00:03:37.37,"was standing right there where Silas was over by the fire, and"
52,00:03:40.70,00:03:40.70,"they got him, and I thought, oh, God... that's mean."
53,00:03:43.80,00:03:43.80,>> Tomorrow is a new day. >> It can be.
54,00:03:47.03,00:03:47.03,"It's got to be. >> It don't got to be, I mean,"
55,00:03:49.97,00:03:49.97,it can be. >> Now it's a new day.
56,00:03:53.50,00:03:53.50,"Yeah, sure, we're outnumbered four to three, but basically"
57,00:03:56.07,00:03:56.07,"they run the show, you know. But, uh... damn you, Carl, for"
58,00:04:01.23,00:04:01.23,"leaving me with a bunch of misfits, you know, to go camping"
59,00:04:03.57,00:04:03.57,"with, 'cause it's gonna be pretty miserable the next couple"
60,00:04:05.93,00:04:05.93,of days. >> Day ten.
61,00:04:20.83,00:04:20.83,>> Day ten. Let's win. >> Yeah.
62,00:04:27.63,00:04:27.63,>> How's it looking? >> Looks like we don't have as
63,00:04:30.17,00:04:30.17,much as we thought we had. >> But it was very generous in
64,00:04:31.83,00:04:31.83,the beginning. >> Very good.
65,00:04:34.27,00:04:34.27,>> Breakfast is served. Breakfast of champions.
66,00:04:38.37,00:04:38.37,">> You know, I worry about Tommy."
67,00:04:39.97,00:04:39.97,Tommy's not eating. A lot of what we have to eat is
68,00:04:42.50,00:04:42.50,"cornmeal, and he has a really tough time eating it."
69,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,I don't think it's a taste thing.
70,00:04:46.97,00:04:46.97,He just... he physically just doesn't like the way it goes
71,00:04:48.93,00:04:48.93,down. All it is really is just grits.
72,00:04:53.00,00:04:53.00,Like you would serve it with breakfast.
73,00:04:56.27,00:04:56.27,">> Well, grits is a nice thought for this stuff, but going down"
74,00:05:02.10,00:05:02.10,"the hatch, it reminds you more of something rhymes with grits."
75,00:05:09.20,00:05:09.20,But... basically no grits. We've got to find a little
76,00:05:13.10,00:05:13.10,something we can munch on. >> Let's start with the fruit.
77,00:05:18.40,00:05:18.40,>> Can you hit that? >> I can hit that.
78,00:05:20.47,00:05:20.47,">> You sure you can hit that? >> Hell, yes, I... You watch me."
79,00:05:23.70,00:05:23.70,>> The big country bear saw the palm trees.
80,00:05:26.60,00:05:26.60,The palm trees have what's called a dome palm fruit on it.
81,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,The palm tree that Tommy found was about 50 feet in the air.
82,00:05:34.23,00:05:34.23,(laughs) He was silly enough to think he
83,00:05:36.57,00:05:36.57,"was going to climb it. >> Tommy, Tommy."
84,00:05:40.93,00:05:40.93,"Hell, no, hell no! Get down, man!"
85,00:05:45.30,00:05:45.30,Tommy... T... Tommy. Your big country ass is climbing
86,00:05:49.03,00:05:49.03,"a tree in the middle of Africa. You realize that, don't you?"
87,00:05:51.07,00:05:51.07,>> What? >> You come down.
88,00:05:53.30,00:05:53.30,"Come down, you don't have no safety harnesses."
89,00:05:58.00,00:05:58.00,I thought he was nuts. Dawg.
90,00:06:00.73,00:06:00.73,"(laughs): He's silly as hell. So finally he got down, and we"
91,00:06:05.03,00:06:05.03,just started throwing rocks at it trying to get something to
92,00:06:08.10,00:06:08.10,"happen. >> All right, brother, rock and"
93,00:06:10.53,00:06:10.53,roll here. >> Watch your head!
94,00:06:18.87,00:06:18.87,">> Damn, Tommy! And, uh, we actually got two of"
95,00:06:21.40,00:06:21.40,"them down. >> Look it, palm!"
96,00:06:23.63,00:06:23.63,">> And then after that, we've hammered ourselves to death"
97,00:06:26.70,00:06:26.70,trying to get the doggoned thing open.
98,00:06:34.43,00:06:34.43,>> Looks like you're getting a nice slice there.
99,00:06:37.97,00:06:37.97,">> Throwing for over 30 minutes, getting two, then taking 20"
100,00:06:42.70,00:06:42.70,minutes to open one-- we had something about the size of your
101,00:06:46.00,00:06:46.00,thumb there that you could eat. >> (gasps)
102,00:06:49.00,00:06:49.00,">> In my opinion, it ain't worth it."
103,00:06:50.97,00:06:50.97,">> I mean, it's not as good as coconut."
104,00:06:52.77,00:06:52.77,It's got a bad aftertaste. >> I ain't mentioned it to Linda
105,00:07:17.23,00:07:17.23,and Teresa. I said I was taking it out of
106,00:07:20.07,00:07:20.07,"fifth gear as far as responsibility, you know,"
107,00:07:22.00,00:07:22.00,"accountability, organizing things, and I was going to sit"
108,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,back. They were the majority-- let's
109,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,see how they run a household. >> Let's see what we have now.
110,00:07:39.27,00:07:39.27,">> When Frank and I got mail this morning, I was loving it."
111,00:07:44.27,00:07:44.27,"Oh, yeah, that was great. I thought, if anything that will"
112,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,drill in that you can't just sleep late.
113,00:07:49.10,00:07:49.10,"Our water is low. Now, we don't have time to get"
114,00:07:52.67,00:07:52.67,"to the water hole. Hey, guys, hate to wake you up."
115,00:07:59.23,00:07:59.23,We got mail! And we got 30 minutes.
116,00:08:02.87,00:08:02.87,">> Oh, my God. >> We were sleeping late, and"
117,00:08:05.63,00:08:05.63,"Linda had gotten tree mail, and came up and woke us and said we"
118,00:08:07.97,00:08:07.97,"had half an hour to go to our reward challenge, which was just"
119,00:08:10.27,00:08:10.27,huge and shocking. So we'd all gotten up and were
120,00:08:12.00,00:08:12.00,all groggy and very cranky. >> Who would like to read this?
121,00:08:15.10,00:08:15.10,">> You read it. You read it. >> No, no, no."
122,00:08:17.43,00:08:17.43,"Why don't one of you read it? >> ""You'll have to decide how"
123,00:08:20.97,00:08:20.97,"high..."" >> Go on. You got it."
124,00:08:23.73,00:08:23.73,">> ""...you should climb. But if your team's better and"
125,00:08:28.80,00:08:28.80,"quick, like a spider, you'll be celebrating as your bellies get"
126,00:08:38.53,00:08:38.53,"wider."" >> Oh!"
127,00:08:40.97,00:08:40.97,>> Yeah! Rise and shine! It's a beautiful day.
128,00:08:44.47,00:08:44.47,">> Let's make it happen, team. >> It's a food reward."
129,00:08:47.43,00:08:47.43,>> It's hot already. >> Anybody hungry?
130,00:08:49.47,00:08:49.47,">> We tried to sleep in, and we got... we were awakened and now"
131,00:08:52.43,00:08:52.43,we're struggling to get our bearings.
132,00:08:56.03,00:08:56.03,">> All right, guys, this is a reward, baby, this is a big 'un."
133,00:09:01.20,00:09:01.20,"Frank, come here. Linda... Hey, you guys come here for a"
134,00:09:03.57,00:09:03.57,"second. Come here, Frank, for just a"
135,00:09:06.47,00:09:06.47,"second, man. You guys, you know what, dad-"
136,00:09:10.90,00:09:10.90,"gummit, man, I know last night was a... you know, we went in"
137,00:09:14.87,00:09:14.87,there 50-50. I realize the situation right
138,00:09:16.77,00:09:16.77,"now, guys. Let's come together right now as"
139,00:09:18.77,00:09:18.77,"a team. I mean, this is... we're so"
140,00:09:21.10,00:09:21.10,"unorganized right now, you know. And we're so... we're so..."
141,00:09:23.83,00:09:23.83,>> Still. >> Still.
142,00:09:25.60,00:09:25.60,">> Silas, with the knee, I've seen him on the knee twice, and"
143,00:09:28.77,00:09:28.77,"I looked at that, and I guess, I don't know, that's like a"
144,00:09:31.57,00:09:31.57,football thing where the coach gets down and just whatever.
145,00:09:36.83,00:09:36.83,Maybe it's genuine. It seemed so cheesy to me.
146,00:09:40.70,00:09:40.70,>> Let's get fired up here and win this.
147,00:09:42.37,00:09:42.37,">> Could I make one suggestion? >> Please, please do. Please."
148,00:09:45.83,00:09:45.83,">> If, um, there were several things last night that were"
149,00:09:47.80,00:09:47.80,"stated, and what that did, that, you know, we were all willing to"
150,00:09:52.83,00:09:52.83,"do this, totally willing to do this..."
151,00:09:54.23,00:09:54.23,>> I know. >> ...and that made it go...
152,00:09:56.57,00:09:56.57,">> You have to understand this, though, too, Linda."
153,00:09:58.27,00:09:58.27,>> That's all. >> What if that was you on the
154,00:10:00.10,00:10:00.10,cutting board? >> There's no way I would have
155,00:10:01.73,00:10:01.73,"come back and said to the three people, ""Hey, team, team, come"
156,00:10:05.57,00:10:05.57,"here,"" and there's no way I would have said, with that girl,"
157,00:10:09.10,00:10:09.10,"""Revenge, revenge."" There's no way I would have"
158,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53,"disrespected any of you that way, no way."
159,00:10:14.53,00:10:14.53,"Kim, you know. >> It's over."
160,00:10:16.30,00:10:16.30,We're coming together now. It's over.
161,00:10:18.10,00:10:18.10,>> It's over and out. >> Thank you!
162,00:10:20.57,00:10:20.57,">> So, I'm sorry that... I'm sorry that it happened."
163,00:10:22.77,00:10:22.77,">> You know... >> Yeah, we got to go."
164,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13,I've been dying to be on this team!
165,00:10:29.13,00:10:29.13,"Let me on the team! >> Linda, this morning, really"
166,00:10:31.90,00:10:31.90,"came unglued. She has two very, very different"
167,00:10:33.77,00:10:33.77,"sides. It's, like, this sweet little"
168,00:10:36.97,00:10:36.97,"New England mom, and then there's this, I don't know,"
169,00:10:41.67,00:10:41.67,"crazy-woman side, too. >> You know, I'm ready to be on"
170,00:10:43.90,00:10:43.90,"the team! Ready to be on the team, honey."
171,00:10:46.80,00:10:46.80,Could I have a hug! See? You're even hesitating.
172,00:10:49.47,00:10:49.47,Give me a hug. You know... why can't you hug
173,00:10:51.30,00:10:51.30,me? >> I hugged you.
174,00:10:53.43,00:10:53.43,">> Frank? Come on, Frank. >> Can I... can we demonstrate a"
175,00:10:55.47,00:10:55.47,"hug? This is a hug, sweetie."
176,00:10:59.60,00:10:59.60,Did your mama never hug you? There you go.
177,00:11:02.33,00:11:02.33,">> They were saying, oh, it was just 'cause anger and, like, let"
178,00:11:04.40,00:11:04.40,"it go. I'm, like, okay, great, let it"
179,00:11:06.30,00:11:06.30,"go, let's hug. And arms went like this, and she"
180,00:11:09.13,00:11:09.13,"has... she got that look in her eyes, like, like, I don't"
181,00:11:12.00,00:11:12.00,"know, I had a knife in my hand or she was gonna... it was..."
182,00:11:15.20,00:11:15.20,it was awfully strange. Why don't you give me a real
183,00:11:17.43,00:11:17.43,hug? >> It was hard.
184,00:11:18.83,00:11:18.83,"It's hard, you know? >> Okay, you're not ready to, I"
185,00:11:21.33,00:11:21.33,"understand, I respect that. >> I saw a side to you that..."
186,00:11:23.63,00:11:23.63,>> I totally respect that. >> ...I'm really nervous about.
187,00:11:25.97,00:11:25.97,">> Well, you know what anger is? Anger is a cover-up for sadness."
188,00:11:28.33,00:11:28.33,"Whenever we're angry... >> Well, I'm good at it, Linda."
189,00:11:30.20,00:11:30.20,">> Sadness, just get there. >> Well, it's funny, I think,"
190,00:11:33.03,00:11:33.03,"it's... if, you know, no matter if it went..."
191,00:11:35.30,00:11:35.30,>> (crying): Don't tell me it's all right.
192,00:11:36.50,00:11:36.50,">> Just trying, just trying. But I respect your space."
193,00:11:40.87,00:11:40.87,">> Just everything sort of hit me this morning, and I just"
194,00:11:43.27,00:11:43.27,"started to cry, because I felt just... I felt sectioned out of"
195,00:11:47.20,00:11:47.20,"my little group, even though they're totally supportive of"
196,00:11:49.17,00:11:49.17,me. I felt like the older group
197,00:11:51.10,00:11:51.10,"picked me, and how can I face them again, and I just felt sad."
198,00:11:55.60,00:11:55.60,"(sniffles) >> PROBST: Good morning, guys."
199,00:12:14.20,00:12:14.20,How's the cornmeal taste? Getting a little bland?
200,00:12:16.93,00:12:16.93,>> Getting? (laughter)
201,00:12:18.40,00:12:18.40,>> PROST: It was bland to begin with.
202,00:12:20.10,00:12:20.10,"All right, hopefully we can do a little something about that"
203,00:12:22.07,00:12:22.07,today. Today's challenge is a food
204,00:12:23.37,00:12:23.37,"reward. Behind us on a rope web, 12"
205,00:12:26.57,00:12:26.57,items that will dramatically improve your meals.
206,00:12:30.10,00:12:30.10,"Things like olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes."
207,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,>> Ooh... >> PROBST: So a big food reward.
208,00:12:36.37,00:12:36.37,"Here's how it works. One at a time, tribe members"
209,00:12:38.40,00:12:38.40,"are gonna make their way up the ramp, across the netting and up"
210,00:12:40.40,00:12:40.40,the rope web. They are going to grab one item
211,00:12:43.53,00:12:43.53,and bring it back. Once you cross the line the next
212,00:12:45.00,00:12:45.00,person goes. The first tribe to get all items
213,00:12:47.57,00:12:47.57,back in their basket wins the food reward.
214,00:12:50.80,00:12:50.80,Losers get squat. Make sense?
215,00:12:54.53,00:12:54.53,"Wait for my go. Here we go, guys."
216,00:12:59.27,00:12:59.27,"Survivors, ready! >> (whoops)"
217,00:13:01.60,00:13:01.60,">> Go! >> Go! Go, baby!"
218,00:13:04.23,00:13:04.23,"(cheering, shouting) (groaning)"
219,00:13:10.87,00:13:10.87,(grunts) (gasps)
220,00:13:17.20,00:13:17.20,>> Whoa! >> Go! Go!
221,00:13:23.50,00:13:23.50,"(whooping, whistling) >> Come on!"
222,00:13:27.57,00:13:27.57,"Come on, Clarence! (indistinct shouts)"
223,00:13:37.93,00:13:37.93,">> Come on, girl. >> Good job!"
224,00:13:40.67,00:13:40.67,(whooping) >> Let's go!
225,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,">> Let's go, team! Come on, team!"
226,00:13:45.27,00:13:45.27,(indistinct shouts) >> Go!
227,00:13:52.03,00:13:52.03,"(whooping) >> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
228,00:13:55.87,00:13:55.87,">> Go, Linda! Come on, Frank!"
229,00:14:03.27,00:14:03.27,"(whooping) >> Let's go, Frank!"
230,00:14:06.13,00:14:06.13,">> PROBST: Okay, guys, get ready for your second run."
231,00:14:08.60,00:14:08.60,"You're still neck and neck. >> Go, B.!"
232,00:14:10.57,00:14:10.57,">> Go! (indistinct shouts, whistling)"
233,00:14:15.67,00:14:15.67,"(grunts) >> Go, go, go, climb!"
234,00:14:32.50,00:14:32.50,It's not like you've never climbed before!
235,00:14:34.13,00:14:34.13,">> Go, T-bird! >> PROBST: All right, guys,"
236,00:14:39.17,00:14:39.17,you're still even. (indistinct shouts)
237,00:14:49.07,00:14:49.07,(indistinct shouts) >> Come on!
238,00:14:55.00,00:14:55.00,">> Come on, Kimmy! (whooping, shouting)"
239,00:15:00.80,00:15:00.80,">> Let's go, let's go! (indistinct shout)"
240,00:15:05.00,00:15:05.00,">> Go, Lindsey! (whooping)"
241,00:15:08.83,00:15:08.83,(whistling) (indistinct shouts)
242,00:15:11.63,00:15:11.63,"(whooping, whistling continue) >> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!"
243,00:15:24.90,00:15:24.90,">> Come on, Kimmy! >> Yeah!"
244,00:15:27.13,00:15:27.13,">> PROBST: Samburu, this is your last basket."
245,00:15:29.17,00:15:29.17,"Boran, you still got two. >> Yeah!"
246,00:15:55.27,00:15:55.27,>> Yeah! >> Samburu!
247,00:16:04.20,00:16:04.20,">> PROBST: Samburu, a lot of stuff in there."
248,00:16:07.33,00:16:07.33,"Take your prize home, have a good meal."
249,00:16:09.97,00:16:09.97,I'll see you guys tomorrow for immunity.
250,00:16:11.80,00:16:11.80,"All right, see you guys."
251,00:16:34.07,00:16:34.07,">> We lost the challenge. Unfortunately, you know, it came"
252,00:16:37.73,00:16:37.73,down to Kim went really slow. I feel terrible for her.
253,00:16:42.40,00:16:42.40,"She couldn't feel good, and I know she doesn't feel good, and"
254,00:16:44.67,00:16:44.67,"it's hard, it must be really... I'm glad I'm not in that"
255,00:16:48.97,00:16:48.97,"situation. >> Sorry, not a great job."
256,00:16:52.97,00:16:52.97,"Well, also, I mean, I don't like to be that terrible at"
257,00:16:55.13,00:16:55.13,"something. That's, like..."
258,00:16:56.73,00:16:56.73,">> No one does. >> That's, like, really"
259,00:16:58.27,00:16:58.27,"terrible. >> You know, we all fell, we all"
260,00:17:00.33,00:17:00.33,"took our time, every one us took fell down."
261,00:17:01.80,00:17:01.80,">> We all said, you know, ""Good job, you did the best you"
262,00:17:03.80,00:17:03.80,"could,"" but, you know, really, she was, like, ""I suck,"" and"
263,00:17:05.87,00:17:05.87,"we're, like, ""Yeah, you... you suck."""
264,00:17:07.80,00:17:07.80,>> I could tell from your faces everybody gave it 100%.
265,00:17:11.10,00:17:11.10,">> You know, in competition it's not about giving it your best"
266,00:17:13.50,00:17:13.50,sometimes; sometimes it's about actual... the winning.
267,00:17:16.50,00:17:16.50,">> We just got to, got to hope we get out there and get them"
268,00:17:18.20,00:17:18.20,next time. >> Let's just drink the water.
269,00:17:21.00,00:17:21.00,>> I wonder what immunity is going to be.
270,00:17:22.53,00:17:22.53,>> I don't know. >> The thing that was most
271,00:17:25.80,00:17:25.80,difficult about today's challenge was my having to face
272,00:17:30.23,00:17:30.23,the reality that Kim is definitely not up to some of the
273,00:17:33.80,00:17:33.80,more physical challenges. >> There's nothing good about
274,00:17:36.13,00:17:36.13,"losing, like, nothing. >> If our team is just real"
275,00:17:40.00,00:17:40.00,"losers and we lose everything, that's going to be awful."
276,00:17:53.90,00:17:53.90,>> All right! (whooping)
277,00:17:56.83,00:17:56.83,">> This morning was a little tense, but we really pulled"
278,00:18:00.20,00:18:00.20,together today and we won some food.
279,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,"All in all, it was an unbelievable victory today."
280,00:18:04.77,00:18:04.77,"So it boosted up morale, boosted spirits, boosted everything,"
281,00:18:08.53,00:18:08.53,confidence-- it was a good thing.
282,00:18:10.27,00:18:10.27,Let's pull them out one at a time and tell me what it is.
283,00:18:12.87,00:18:12.87,>> We've got... golden chicken blend.
284,00:18:14.97,00:18:14.97,>> Nice. >> Spice?
285,00:18:16.70,00:18:16.70,">> Ooh, to put in the mush. >> Olive oil!"
286,00:18:19.03,00:18:19.03,"(gasps) >> Yeah, olive oil."
287,00:18:20.73,00:18:20.73,>> The basket we won was just amazing.
288,00:18:22.70,00:18:22.70,"We won soup mix, you know, rice, we won, like, jelly to put on"
289,00:18:25.77,00:18:25.77,"stuff. I mean, it's flavor, for the"
290,00:18:29.10,00:18:29.10,"food that we have, and that's key."
291,00:18:31.87,00:18:31.87,(speaking indistinctly) >> I cannot be any more excited
292,00:18:35.43,00:18:35.43,"about the fact we got food, unless it was water."
293,00:18:37.20,00:18:37.20,(laughs) I would give it all up for
294,00:18:39.10,00:18:39.10,"water. >> Should we do a water run,"
295,00:18:40.27,00:18:40.27,right now? >> Right now.
296,00:18:41.40,00:18:41.40,">> We're going to have a heck of a hike, though-- we're carrying"
297,00:18:43.47,00:18:43.47,all three big gourds... >> We'll go slow.
298,00:18:44.80,00:18:44.80,>> ...all the water gourds. Load up.
299,00:18:45.93,00:18:45.93,">> We can take some rests, I think, 'cause..."
300,00:18:47.23,00:18:47.23,>> Sure. >> One of the big focuses in our
301,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,"group is water, obviously. We have to go get the water, we"
302,00:18:51.67,00:18:51.67,have to boil the water. Frank and Doc were kind of the
303,00:18:54.10,00:18:54.10,"two people who took it under their wing, they were kind of"
304,00:18:56.53,00:18:56.53,"the water people, getting the water going."
305,00:18:58.33,00:18:58.33,And our group was going... and they were doing all the
306,00:19:01.47,00:19:01.47,work. Fine with us; we don't do any of
307,00:19:03.30,00:19:03.30,it. We were more focused on the
308,00:19:05.07,00:19:05.07,split in the tribe and manipulating people and doing
309,00:19:08.07,00:19:08.07,that than we were about any other part of surviving out
310,00:19:10.13,00:19:10.13,"here. >> You fill this one, then you"
311,00:19:13.30,00:19:13.30,"take a breather, I'll fill this, and we'll rotate the fillers"
312,00:19:15.80,00:19:15.80,"here. Because I know, you know, you"
313,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,"and Linda usually fill these things, and we'll rotate."
314,00:19:20.03,00:19:20.03,>> That's cool. >> We were in a real water
315,00:19:22.10,00:19:22.10,"crunch. I mean, we were all dehydrated"
316,00:19:24.37,00:19:24.37,from the challenge severely. And I'm sure to prove a point to
317,00:19:29.07,00:19:29.07,"us, Frank and Linda and T let the water level get..."
318,00:19:32.67,00:19:32.67,"completely gone. >> Come on, guys, last leg."
319,00:19:35.13,00:19:35.13,We're almost there. >> We're just going...
320,00:19:38.93,00:19:38.93,">> Then we came home, lost another pot completely."
321,00:19:44.17,00:19:44.17,"Pots are extremely valuable, because that's the only way we"
322,00:19:46.50,00:19:46.50,have to have clean drinking water.
323,00:19:47.97,00:19:47.97,We have to boil it. >> Is it leaking right now?
324,00:19:50.40,00:19:50.40,>> Yeah. >> Yep.
325,00:19:51.90,00:19:51.90,>> One of our pots now is completely unusable and the
326,00:19:54.03,00:19:54.03,"other one, you know, is still on its side and just, it's"
327,00:19:55.97,00:19:55.97,crumbling. Every time we put it in the fire
328,00:19:58.30,00:19:58.30,it crumbles more and more. >> Let's fill it up.
329,00:20:00.37,00:20:00.37,Who's got a gourd? >> Things began to slack off.
330,00:20:12.17,00:20:12.17,"You know, the water rations went down."
331,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,"My plan of attack was, you know, to let the comfort level drop"
332,00:20:17.70,00:20:17.70,"completely low, and they would..."
333,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,"I know they would break down. And, uh, you could see that"
334,00:20:22.77,00:20:22.77,"things were falling apart. >> Oh, my gosh."
335,00:20:26.30,00:20:26.30,"Guys, we're in a heap of trouble."
336,00:20:28.80,00:20:28.80,>> Can you save the bottom? Can you save it where it's
337,00:20:30.67,00:20:30.67,leaking out? >> Hold that side.
338,00:20:35.20,00:20:35.20,>> You ready? >> Let's see if we can lift it.
339,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,Lift it off the ground. Right there.
340,00:20:40.43,00:20:40.43,>> We now have completely shattered all of our pots.
341,00:20:45.20,00:20:45.20,So it's a horrible situation that we got ourselves into.
342,00:20:48.20,00:20:48.20,">> Huh. >> We are not in good shape,"
343,00:20:50.77,00:20:50.77,"boys and girls, I'll just say that right now."
344,00:20:52.43,00:20:52.43,">> We'll make due, we'll make due."
345,00:20:53.83,00:20:53.83,">> I'm still, like, God, this tribe, can we get our act"
346,00:20:55.43,00:20:55.43,"together? You know, there's still that"
347,00:20:57.67,00:20:57.67,"hanging over my head, like... what's wrong with us?"
348,00:21:01.20,00:21:01.20,"You know, we crack pots, we whine, we complain, we have"
349,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73,"problems, people are fighting, da-da-da-da, whatever, and I'm"
350,00:21:06.53,00:21:06.53,"like, God, when are we going to get this together?"
351,00:21:18.70,00:21:18.70,"(screeching) >> What's up ahead, Tom?"
352,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60,>> Baboons. Looks like a pretty good tribe
353,00:21:23.33,00:21:23.33,of them. >> Best thing we can do is just
354,00:21:25.40,00:21:25.40,let them go. They let us go.
355,00:21:27.83,00:21:27.83,We're starting to be animal- friendly.
356,00:21:29.70,00:21:29.70,"Whatever they want, we'll do. >> Sometimes you do get"
357,00:21:32.67,00:21:32.67,"comfortable, a little bit comfortable here, and, you know,"
358,00:21:35.50,00:21:35.50,you think you're all safe and everything's great.
359,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,And then you get a wake-up call. (whistling)
360,00:21:40.27,00:21:40.27,">> Buffalo. >> Tom had his eyes up, thank"
361,00:21:43.90,00:21:43.90,God. >> Stand there.
362,00:21:49.20,00:21:49.20,">> We've all done our homework, and we all know that that is the"
363,00:21:52.63,00:21:52.63, one animal that we need to be most careful of.
364,00:21:56.63,00:21:56.63,It's considered to be the most dangerous animal in Africa.
365,00:22:00.20,00:22:00.20,">> You don't mess with this, you guys, you know?"
366,00:22:01.90,00:22:01.90,>> It was scary. It was there and it was huge.
367,00:22:04.57,00:22:04.57,"So when we saw this thing, we made a lot of noise."
368,00:22:07.13,00:22:07.13,>> Ho! (whistling)
369,00:22:09.80,00:22:09.80,>> And then we realized at that point we needed to leave this
370,00:22:11.67,00:22:11.67,"place. >> All right, guys, let's go."
371,00:22:14.07,00:22:14.07,">> You want to head a little left, Tommy?"
372,00:22:15.33,00:22:15.33,>> You all in agreement that we should go a little bit fur...
373,00:22:17.30,00:22:17.30,"left? >> I can still see him, too."
374,00:22:20.20,00:22:20.20,"I don't want to move. >> I don't think we should move,"
375,00:22:21.57,00:22:21.57,either. >> He's coming right towards
376,00:22:22.73,00:22:22.73,camp. >> We're not in a hurry.
377,00:22:24.23,00:22:24.23,>> Not a single one of us came here thinking that all of this
378,00:22:28.33,00:22:28.33,danger was going to be real. >> Our camp's right over there
379,00:22:31.17,00:22:31.17,to the left. >> We're finding on a daily
380,00:22:33.07,00:22:33.07,"basis, we're having these kind of sobering experiences"
381,00:22:35.30,00:22:35.30,"that remind us every day that we need to respect the land, and"
382,00:22:40.77,00:22:40.77,that this whole thing is very real.
383,00:22:43.67,00:22:43.67,Danger is here. >> Bad-tempered.
384,00:22:47.93,00:22:47.93,>> Bad neighbors.
385,00:23:05.87,00:23:05.87,">> Good morning, camp Samburu. Rise and shine."
386,00:23:11.37,00:23:11.37,Don't plug in the curling irons. There ain't no beauty contest
387,00:23:14.10,00:23:14.10,"this morning, just a little watering hole expedition."
388,00:23:16.57,00:23:16.57,(groaning) This morning I took a long shot.
389,00:23:19.70,00:23:19.70,"First thing before the sun even got up, I got them up."
390,00:23:22.40,00:23:22.40,"The water thing I can't ignore. Believe me, if it was just me"
391,00:23:25.37,00:23:25.37,"and them, I'd let them fall flat on their faces, 'cause I don't"
392,00:23:28.27,00:23:28.27,"give a damn, you know? But I can't do that to Teresa"
393,00:23:30.00,00:23:30.00,"and Linda. I feel compelled to, you know,"
394,00:23:32.57,00:23:32.57,want to protect and make life easy for them as well.
395,00:23:35.60,00:23:35.60,You can take a nice little morning hike.
396,00:23:38.07,00:23:38.07,"Get it out of the way. While it's nice and cool, all"
397,00:23:40.40,00:23:40.40,right? >> All right.
398,00:23:41.70,00:23:41.70,">> Come on, guys. >> Frank, we just hit the snooze"
399,00:23:44.37,00:23:44.37,button. >> Oh don't tell me you guys are
400,00:23:47.13,00:23:47.13,the snooze button type of people.
401,00:23:48.47,00:23:48.47,">> Mm-hmm. >> Oh, you don't need a snooze"
402,00:23:50.07,00:23:50.07,button. You've been sleeping most of
403,00:23:51.87,00:23:51.87,"your lives. Come on, it's getting hot"
404,00:23:53.80,00:23:53.80,already. >> Who-who agreed on this?
405,00:23:59.70,00:23:59.70,"Who, uh... >> Shut up. Shut up."
406,00:24:20.83,00:24:20.83,"(elephant trumpeting) >> My ass is on the line here,"
407,00:24:24.23,00:24:24.23,you know. >> It's not... I mean...

409,00:24:28.37,00:24:28.37,>> We'll just buy you a little more time...
410,00:24:29.73,00:24:29.73,">> I know. Then we don't have... >> one more challenge, then you"
411,00:24:31.83,00:24:31.83,"don't have to worry about it. ""Living like nomads means moving"
412,00:24:38.13,00:24:38.13,"around. Do well at this challenge, you"
413,00:24:42.73,00:24:42.73,may stick around. Now if you fall behind and the
414,00:24:46.50,00:24:46.50,"other tribe wins, it's immunity for them as your hike to Council"
415,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,"begins."" It is physical, but I'm sure you"
416,00:24:52.50,00:24:52.50,"have to do... smarts with it, too."
417,00:24:54.97,00:24:54.97,"It isn't just brute, like pushing a rock."
418,00:25:09.77,00:25:09.77,">> PROBST: All right, first thing I need to do-- take back"
419,00:25:11.67,00:25:11.67,"the immunity idol. Give it up, Clarence."
420,00:25:14.53,00:25:14.53,(laughter) Immunity back at stake again
421,00:25:17.07,00:25:17.07,"today. For today's immunity challenge,"
422,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,we're going to look to our African hosts for a little
423,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,inspiration. The tribes of East Africa are
424,00:25:25.13,00:25:25.13,"nomadic, thus they are constantly relocating their"
425,00:25:27.20,00:25:27.20,camp. That's what you guys are going
426,00:25:29.80,00:25:29.80,to do today. Each tribe has a camp with a
427,00:25:32.33,00:25:32.33,"hut, an animal pen, flagpole, and various camp supplies."
428,00:25:37.27,00:25:37.27,"First tribe to relocate their camp up to your new home, 200"
429,00:25:41.03,00:25:41.03,"yards up the hill, and recreate it exactly as it is here, wins"
430,00:25:45.87,00:25:45.87,immunity. Here are the rules.
431,00:25:48.47,00:25:48.47,Two members from each tribe will be your architects.
432,00:25:52.40,00:25:52.40,Their job is to remember how the camp looks here and to make sure
433,00:25:56.10,00:25:56.10,that it gets recreated exactly the same way in your new home.
434,00:25:59.27,00:25:59.27,They will not help move the camp.
435,00:26:01.27,00:26:01.27,They will be up at the new location.
436,00:26:02.97,00:26:02.97,And they can only help you rebuild once your pieces have
437,00:26:05.80,00:26:05.80,been placed inside your circle. The other members will be
438,00:26:08.83,00:26:08.83,responsible for actually physically relocating the camp.
439,00:26:12.97,00:26:12.97,Last rule. The flagpole is the last thing
440,00:26:16.20,00:26:16.20,"you put in. Samburu, because you guys are"
441,00:26:18.60,00:26:18.60,"still one member ahead, somebody is sitting out."
442,00:26:20.23,00:26:20.23,"Once you've made that decision, send that person with your"
443,00:26:23.27,00:26:23.27,architects to the top of the hill.
444,00:26:27.13,00:26:27.13,"All right, Samburu, you're sitting out Teresa."
445,00:26:29.73,00:26:29.73,Brandon and Linda will be your architects.
446,00:26:32.33,00:26:32.33,"Boran, you've selected Kelly and Kim as your architects."
447,00:26:37.10,00:26:37.10,"All right, architects are in place at the top of the hill."
448,00:26:40.60,00:26:40.60,"Immunity at stake. Survivors, ready!"
449,00:26:44.17,00:26:44.17,"Go! >> Go, go, go!"
450,00:26:55.73,00:26:55.73,">> Lift it up, lift it up. (indistinct shouts)"
451,00:27:06.60,00:27:06.60,>> Let's go! I got it. Lift it up.
452,00:27:10.70,00:27:10.70,>> Make it steady up the hill! You guys are doing awesome!
453,00:27:16.20,00:27:16.20,>> Take your time. >> Just go! Move it.
454,00:27:17.77,00:27:17.77,>> Take your time. (indistinct talking)
455,00:27:23.70,00:27:23.70,">> Come on, let's go. >> Turn. Turn."
456,00:27:29.10,00:27:29.10,"Come on, turn. Back it up, back it up."
457,00:27:30.93,00:27:30.93,"Down. 'Kay, yeah. Little back this way."
458,00:27:33.60,00:27:33.60,">> Move, Frank! Move! >> Let's go!"
459,00:27:37.07,00:27:37.07,">> Drop, drop, drop, drop it. (indistinct shouts)"
460,00:27:46.10,00:27:46.10,>> Lift it up. >> What about the basket?
461,00:27:49.43,00:27:49.43,">> Wait, wait, wait! >> Come on! You're doing great!"
462,00:27:55.40,00:27:55.40,>> Your pace is excellent! >> Let's go!
463,00:27:58.40,00:27:58.40,"Kim, get on it, use your shoulders."
464,00:27:59.60,00:27:59.60,>> I have it! >> Excellent work.

466,00:28:13.13,00:28:13.13,">> You got to go ack, back, back. Okay."
467,00:28:14.90,00:28:14.90,(shouts continue) >> PROBST: Boran all you have
468,00:28:18.67,00:28:18.67,left are your roof and your flag.
469,00:28:21.03,00:28:21.03,Samburu you still need the walls to your hut.
470,00:28:26.13,00:28:26.13,>> That goes over here. >> Ready?
471,00:28:29.23,00:28:29.23,"Come on, Tommy. Come on, Tommy."

486,00:29:27.00,00:29:27.00,"(indistinct talking) >> Good job, guys!"

490,00:29:40.33,00:29:40.33,>> PROBST: See you guys tomorrow
491,00:29:41.50,00:29:41.50,night at Tribal Council.
492,00:30:34.33,00:30:34.33,">> Happy birthday. >> Oh, thank you, sweetie."
493,00:30:36.37,00:30:36.37,"Happy Birthday. >> This morning, Frank's"
494,00:30:38.30,00:30:38.30,"birthday, got up, gave him a birthday hug, and he was"
495,00:30:40.90,00:30:40.90,"whittling on his torch, and he was carving his children and his"
496,00:30:42.93,00:30:42.93,wife's name. I thought that was just
497,00:30:46.23,00:30:46.23,beautiful. >> I grabbed my Tribal Council
498,00:30:51.13,00:30:51.13,"torch, and I wanted my wife and two daughters, Josyln and Sage's"
499,00:30:54.13,00:30:54.13,"name to be on that, for not only now, the strength, but even"
500,00:30:57.43,00:30:57.43,"when I leave, you know, I want it to be carried with me."
501,00:31:00.60,00:31:00.60,They were with me all the time. So it was important for me to do
502,00:31:02.80,00:31:02.80,that. >> I'll tell you one thing.
503,00:31:08.90,00:31:08.90,We could have used Carl yesterday.
504,00:31:10.93,00:31:10.93,"We might have won. Oh, yeah. I bet you tactically they were"
505,00:31:14.87,00:31:14.87,wondering about that. But I think you can get some
506,00:31:17.83,00:31:17.83,"mileage, Frank. If you fly low, you can get"
507,00:31:19.37,00:31:19.37,there. >> If I get there I think I'm
508,00:31:23.37,00:31:23.37,going to go behind enemy lines. >> Are you?
509,00:31:26.57,00:31:26.57,>> Just to stir things up. >> It's nice to be walking
510,00:31:35.83,00:31:35.83,"someplace for fun, isn't it? >> What a change, what a"
511,00:31:37.83,00:31:37.83,difference. >> We kicked ass in that
512,00:31:40.77,00:31:40.77,"challenge and we won, and it saved Kim's life."
513,00:31:45.60,00:31:45.60,>> Words can't express how happy I am.
514,00:31:47.97,00:31:47.97,"I mean, I could just stand here and cry."
515,00:31:51.30,00:31:51.30,I'm so happy. And the thing that makes me
516,00:31:53.73,00:31:53.73,really happy... is that I think they're all
517,00:31:57.77,00:31:57.77,"happy about it, even personally, for me."
518,00:32:01.60,00:32:01.60,">> We've won immunity, and the other team is going to Tribal"
519,00:32:04.90,00:32:04.90,"Council, so we have to whole day to ourselves, no chores, so we"
520,00:32:07.53,00:32:07.53,decided to explore a little bit. When our tribe climbed up that
521,00:32:15.50,00:32:15.50,"mountain, you know, I got that feeling back about why, what was"
522,00:32:19.33,00:32:19.33,really important and why I was there.
523,00:32:25.70,00:32:25.70,"Everyone is happy and the tribe is happy, and we're all having"
524,00:32:27.83,00:32:27.83,"fun. And it was just so pleasant, it"
525,00:32:32.50,00:32:32.50,"was like... we're here, like, we're in Africa."
526,00:32:38.43,00:32:38.43,">> Tribe, you've seen the promised land."
527,00:32:55.87,00:32:55.87,">> It's obviously D day. Um, we go to Tribal Council this"
528,00:32:58.57,00:32:58.57,evening. We know it's either going to be
529,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,"myself, T or Frank that's going to go."
530,00:33:05.83,00:33:05.83,">> I wish it had been me who had been voted for, because it"
531,00:33:08.33,00:33:08.33,wouldn't have bothered me at all.
532,00:33:09.40,00:33:09.40,">> I was just kind of sitting there relaxing, and everyone"
533,00:33:11.73,00:33:11.73,started opening up very neutrally and casually.
534,00:33:14.87,00:33:14.87,>> I think tonight will be better.
535,00:33:15.97,00:33:15.97,I think we're calmer. >> Yeah.
536,00:33:17.00,00:33:17.00,">> And we understand what's going on a little bit better,"
537,00:33:18.97,00:33:18.97,and I won't be voted out. (laughs)
538,00:33:22.73,00:33:22.73,">> So who's going tonight, since we're so open?"
539,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,">> Yeah, I like that. >> Well, hey, I know this sounds"
540,00:33:27.27,00:33:27.27,crazy. We know it's one of us.
541,00:33:29.23,00:33:29.23,Wouldn't you rather know if it's gonna be you?
542,00:33:30.73,00:33:30.73,>> We're not gonna tell you. >> We're not gonna tell you.
543,00:33:34.27,00:33:34.27,">> Just hold off, because I agree with Brandon."
544,00:33:36.37,00:33:36.37,Let me just throw this out. >> I don't want this day to be
545,00:33:38.13,00:33:38.13,bad. >> Let me throw this out.
546,00:33:39.80,00:33:39.80,And I don't want the day to be bad anyway.
547,00:33:41.47,00:33:41.47,But let's just be real here that we're playing the game.
548,00:33:43.90,00:33:43.90,Lindsey already has four votes against her.
549,00:33:46.03,00:33:46.03,"If you ever go into Tribal Council with a tie, like myself"
550,00:33:48.53,00:33:48.53,"and someone else, the tiebreaker who has the most"
551,00:33:50.60,00:33:50.60,votes is out. None of us have one vote against
552,00:33:53.33,00:33:53.33,"us, not one. >> Except for Lindsey."
553,00:33:57.10,00:33:57.10,>> Except for Lindsey-- this is the key.
554,00:33:58.77,00:33:58.77,>> As of this moment. >> This is the key.
555,00:34:00.60,00:34:00.60,">> I never thought I'd say, ""Vote for me three times"
556,00:34:03.77,00:34:03.77,"tonight. Come on!"" But it will help us, it'll help"
557,00:34:06.20,00:34:06.20,"us in the end, as long as I don't get voted for, you know,"
558,00:34:09.00,00:34:09.00,once the merger happens. >> Whoever is being voted off
559,00:34:12.20,00:34:12.20,tonight should vote for Lindsey. >> And what's in it for us?
560,00:34:14.17,00:34:14.17,">> Nothing. >> Please stick with us on this,"
561,00:34:17.53,00:34:17.53,"and just think about it, and vote for Lindsey."
562,00:34:19.83,00:34:19.83,">> I'll be honest, I care, but, like, if I'm the person who's"
563,00:34:22.70,00:34:22.70,"going this evening, I'm not going to do that."
564,00:34:26.00,00:34:26.00,Because there's totally nothing in it for me.
565,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,">> Well, they wouldn't say who's going tonight, but they had a"
566,00:34:32.13,00:34:32.13,"plan they wanted us to follow-- you know, us now."
567,00:34:36.87,00:34:36.87,"It's just, it's funny, that's all."
568,00:34:39.00,00:34:39.00,">> Would you rather bring the whole ship down with you, or"
569,00:34:40.93,00:34:40.93,would you rather save your ship? >> The whole ship is not coming
570,00:34:42.77,00:34:42.77,"down. >> That's the point, Linda."
571,00:34:44.40,00:34:44.40,>> I do not want to see Silas win the million dollars.
572,00:34:47.57,00:34:47.57,"I can see any of the other three win the million dollars, but I"
573,00:34:50.00,00:34:50.00,don't want him winning the million dollars.
574,00:34:51.70,00:34:51.70,"I don't trust him at all. There's something, there's"
575,00:34:54.30,00:34:54.30,something up there. I'm not even sure of his name.
576,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,There's just something not quite right.
577,00:35:02.27,00:35:02.27,>> One of the three of you has to go. I mean...
578,00:35:05.03,00:35:05.03,">> I don't know, Frank and Linda how do you guys feel?"
579,00:35:07.87,00:35:07.87,"If I'm going, I'd rather know. >> The minute we told you and we"
580,00:35:12.40,00:35:12.40,"were about to be honest with you, you said, ""What's in it for"
581,00:35:14.03,00:35:14.03,"me?"" So why in the world would we"
582,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,go ahead and finish? That was a bitter taste in
583,00:35:18.30,00:35:18.30,the mouth right there. >> I really don't know which way
584,00:35:20.93,00:35:20.93,"they're going, but I guess there's a reason they could keep"
585,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,each one of us and a reason they could decide to take each one of
586,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77,us off. >> Let's drop this.
587,00:35:27.73,00:35:27.73,Let's drop this. >> There's not an event in the
588,00:35:31.37,00:35:31.37,future that would alarm me. I can't wait until the merge
589,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90,because I plan on winning this. You might as well write the
590,00:35:37.87,00:35:37.87,"check and hand it to me, because I'm shooting for the stars,"
591,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57,and-and... I'm going to get there.
592,00:36:13.03,00:36:13.03,">> PROBST: Well, guys, back for a second time in a row."
593,00:36:15.73,00:36:15.73,Let's go back to the first time you were here.
594,00:36:18.90,00:36:18.90,Pretty intense dialogue was had. When you went back to camp that
595,00:36:23.07,00:36:23.07,"night, was there any of the bonding that you guys talked"
596,00:36:26.73,00:36:26.73,about making the tribe one again?
597,00:36:29.40,00:36:29.40,">> The first night, you know, there was some emotional times"
598,00:36:32.03,00:36:32.03,"right after the Council. Feelings were hurt, you know."
599,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,None of us know how it feels except Lindsey to get a vote
600,00:36:39.03,00:36:39.03,"against you, and so that was hard, Jeff."
601,00:36:42.57,00:36:42.57,"But after that, the second day, much better."
602,00:36:45.40,00:36:45.40,"We came together as a unit. >> PROBST: Frank, after the last"
603,00:36:49.27,00:36:49.27,"immunity challenge, you guys knew you were coming back to"
604,00:36:51.37,00:36:51.37,Tribal Council. What happened when you went back
605,00:36:52.87,00:36:52.87,to camp? What was the tone of the tribe?
606,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,"Were you guys concerned? >> Well, obviously the three of"
607,00:36:57.67,00:36:57.67,"us, you know, we knew one of us would be going."
608,00:36:59.47,00:36:59.47,">> PROBST: The three of you, referring to Linda and Teresa?"
609,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,">> To Linda, Teresa and myself. There are two tribes within one"
610,00:37:04.37,00:37:04.37,still. >> PROBST: It's surprising to
611,00:37:07.87,00:37:07.87,"me, because it's the first time I've ever seen this."
612,00:37:10.43,00:37:10.43,"I'm trying to figure out where the logic to this is, because"
613,00:37:13.13,00:37:13.13,"going into a merge, you need numbers."
614,00:37:16.10,00:37:16.10,">> Is there a sure thing in this whole game, Jeff?"
615,00:37:18.23,00:37:18.23,Can you tell me one sure thing about this whole entire game?
616,00:37:20.67,00:37:20.67,>> PROBST: I can tell you... >> Just one.
617,00:37:22.07,00:37:22.07,">> PROBST: Yeah, I can tell you one sure thing."
618,00:37:24.07,00:37:24.07,If Samburu goes into a merge with four people solid and one
619,00:37:27.57,00:37:27.57,"not solid, and Boran goes in with five people solid, Samburu"
620,00:37:30.77,00:37:30.77,is in trouble. That I can tell you for certain.
621,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,">> Jeff, you need to take into consideration, if I wasn't here"
622,00:37:36.20,00:37:36.20,tonight... >> There we go.
623,00:37:38.37,00:37:38.37,>> ...one of us would be going. It would be the same thing.
624,00:37:40.60,00:37:40.60,It would be the exact same thing but reversed.
625,00:37:43.20,00:37:43.20,">> PROBST: Frank, anything you can do to turn this game around"
626,00:37:45.80,00:37:45.80,"at this point? >> Oh, there's always something"
627,00:37:47.13,00:37:47.13,to do. It's just waiting for the proper
628,00:37:49.57,00:37:49.57,"opening, you know, to happen. >> PROBST: So you have a game"
629,00:37:51.77,00:37:51.77,plan? >> Absolutely.
630,00:37:52.93,00:37:52.93,>> PROBST: You're sticking to it?
631,00:37:54.73,00:37:54.73,">> Mm-hmm. >> PROBST: Lindsey, have you"
632,00:37:57.50,00:37:57.50,"made any mistakes so far, anything that...?"
633,00:37:59.63,00:37:59.63,">> Oh, tons. I'm a walking mistake."
634,00:38:02.50,00:38:02.50,">> You know, when you hear things-- ""Oh, you're the one"
635,00:38:04.60,00:38:04.60,"that's next,"" ""No, Kim's next,"" ""Oh, no, it's Brandon,"" you"
636,00:38:06.87,00:38:06.87,"panic, and I brought some negative energy to the group"
637,00:38:10.47,00:38:10.47,"because I was frustrated and fed up, and I freaked out about the"
638,00:38:14.27,00:38:14.27,whole manipulative process and the panic attacks and the
639,00:38:17.43,00:38:17.43,"feelings of anxiety like you're the one that's going to go next,"
640,00:38:20.60,00:38:20.60,"and, you know, you lose sight of reality because it's not"
641,00:38:23.50,00:38:23.50,reality. It's just a game and we're
642,00:38:26.07,00:38:26.07,"trying to keep that in perspective, and I'm awful at it"
643,00:38:28.23,00:38:28.23,"because I'm sensitive, I get my feelings hurt."
644,00:38:30.90,00:38:30.90,">> PROBST: Brandon, have you ever taken a walk by yourself"
645,00:38:33.83,00:38:33.83,"and thought, ""Okay, wait a minute..."""
646,00:38:34.97,00:38:34.97,>> I don't do anything by myself-- I'm always with them.
647,00:38:37.57,00:38:37.57,Always. I'm always with them. These are my friends.
648,00:38:41.97,00:38:41.97,"Even aside from the game, they're my friends."
649,00:38:43.80,00:38:43.80,I'm not changing my mind on any of that.
650,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,"Yeah, definitely. >> PROBST: It's time to vote."
651,00:38:48.40,00:38:48.40,"Lindsey, you're first. >> It's a game..."
652,00:39:04.30,00:39:04.30,"and it's your time to go. >> Well, buddy, this is for"
653,00:39:39.43,00:39:39.43,"Carl, for Frank and for Teresa. It's only a game."
654,00:39:44.27,00:39:44.27,Play nicely. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
655,00:40:09.03,00:40:09.03,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
656,00:40:30.23,00:40:30.23,decision is final. The person will be asked to
657,00:40:32.13,00:40:32.13,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
658,00:40:34.20,00:40:34.20,I'll read the votes. First vote...
659,00:40:40.27,00:40:40.27,Silas. Silas.
660,00:40:55.83,00:40:55.83,Silas. Three votes Silas.
661,00:41:03.47,00:41:03.47,Linda. Linda.
662,00:41:13.83,00:41:13.83,"Linda. Three votes Silas, three votes"
663,00:41:16.33,00:41:16.33,Linda. Final vote.
664,00:41:24.70,00:41:24.70,Linda. You need to bring me your torch.
665,00:41:31.43,00:41:31.43,(speaking quietly) >> Play nicely.
666,00:41:42.10,00:41:42.10,>> PROBST: Linda... the tribe has spoken.
667,00:41:45.20,00:41:45.20,>> Got it. >> PROBST: It's time for you to
668,00:41:49.27,00:41:49.27,go. >> Bye guys.
669,00:41:50.60,00:41:50.60,">> Bye. >> PROBST: Well, one very clear"
670,00:41:58.03,00:41:58.03,"result of this split within your own tribe is that, Lindsey, you"
671,00:42:00.83,00:42:00.83,"now have four votes against you, Silas you have three votes."
672,00:42:03.87,00:42:03.87,That's a lot of votes after only two Tribal Councils.
673,00:42:06.13,00:42:06.13,Could most definitely come into play in future votes.
674,00:42:09.03,00:42:09.03,>> No doubt. >> We know very well.
675,00:42:10.57,00:42:10.57,>> PROBST: I'll leave you with this final thought.
676,00:42:13.37,00:42:13.37,"Silas, you said it best: this game changes minute by minute."
677,00:42:17.10,00:42:17.10,It certainly does. You guys can head back to camp.
678,00:42:19.63,00:42:19.63,"I'll see you tomorrow. >> Well, it's been an"
679,00:42:52.80,00:42:52.80,"interesting 12 days. I think our vote tonight, the"
680,00:42:55.30,00:42:55.30,"older people's alliance, is a very significant honor."
681,00:42:59.73,00:42:59.73,It's very important to us. Integrity is very important to
682,00:43:02.13,00:43:02.13,"us. To me, it's not whether you win"
683,00:43:05.47,00:43:05.47,"or lose, it's how you play the game."
684,00:43:08.13,00:43:08.13,"I've grown, I've learned. It's just been great."
685,00:43:11.07,00:43:11.07, Namaste.
