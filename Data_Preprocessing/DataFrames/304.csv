68,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,I don't think it's a tastething.

74,00:05:09.20,00:05:09.20,But... basically no grits.We've got to find a little
75,00:05:13.10,00:05:13.10,something we can munch on.>> Let's start with the fruit.
76,00:05:18.40,00:05:18.40,>> Can you hit that?>> I can hit that.

80,00:05:31.00,00:05:31.00,The palm tree that Tommy foundwas about 50 feet in the air.
81,00:05:34.23,00:05:34.23,(laughs)He was silly enough to think he

270,00:17:25.80,00:17:25.80,difficult about today'schallenge was my having to face
271,00:17:30.23,00:17:30.23,the reality that Kim isdefinitely not up to some of the
272,00:17:33.80,00:17:33.80,more physical challenges.>> There's nothing good about

279,00:18:04.77,00:18:04.77,"So it boosted up morale, boostedspirits, boosted everything,"
280,00:18:08.53,00:18:08.53,confidence-- it was a goodthing.
281,00:18:10.27,00:18:10.27,Let's pull them out one at atime and tell me what it is.
282,00:18:12.87,00:18:12.87,>> We've got...golden chicken blend.

289,00:18:29.10,00:18:29.10,"food that we have, and that'skey."
290,00:18:31.87,00:18:31.87,(speaking indistinctly)>> I cannot be any more excited
291,00:18:35.43,00:18:35.43,"about the fact we got food,unless it was water."
292,00:18:37.20,00:18:37.20,(laughs)I would give it all up for
293,00:18:39.10,00:18:39.10,"water.>> Should we do a water run,"
294,00:18:40.27,00:18:40.27,right now?>> Right now.

298,00:18:45.93,00:18:45.93,">> We can take some rests, Ithink, 'cause..."
299,00:18:47.23,00:18:47.23,>> Sure.>> One of the big focuses in our
300,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,"group is water, obviously.We have to go get the water, we"
301,00:18:51.67,00:18:51.67,have to boil the water.Frank and Doc were kind of the
302,00:18:54.10,00:18:54.10,"two people who took it undertheir wing, they were kind of"
303,00:18:56.53,00:18:56.53,"the water people, getting thewater going."
304,00:18:58.33,00:18:58.33,And our group was going...and they were doing all the
305,00:19:01.47,00:19:01.47,work.Fine with us; we don't do any of
306,00:19:03.30,00:19:03.30,it.We were more focused on the
307,00:19:05.07,00:19:05.07,split in the tribe andmanipulating people and doing
308,00:19:08.07,00:19:08.07,that than we were about anyother part of surviving out
309,00:19:10.13,00:19:10.13,"here.>> You fill this one, then you"
310,00:19:13.30,00:19:13.30,"take a breather, I'll fill this,and we'll rotate the fillers"
311,00:19:15.80,00:19:15.80,"here.Because I know, you know, you"
312,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,"and Linda usually fill thesethings, and we'll rotate."
313,00:19:20.03,00:19:20.03,>> That's cool.>> We were in a real water
314,00:19:22.10,00:19:22.10,"crunch.I mean, we were all dehydrated"
315,00:19:24.37,00:19:24.37,from the challenge severely.And I'm sure to prove a point to
316,00:19:29.07,00:19:29.07,"us, Frank and Linda and T letthe water level get..."
317,00:19:32.67,00:19:32.67,"completely gone.>> Come on, guys, last leg."
318,00:19:35.13,00:19:35.13,We're almost there.>> We're just going...
319,00:19:38.93,00:19:38.93,">> Then we came home,lost another pot completely."
320,00:19:44.17,00:19:44.17,"Pots are extremely valuable,because that's the only way we"
321,00:19:46.50,00:19:46.50,have to have clean drinkingwater.
322,00:19:47.97,00:19:47.97,We have to boil it.>> Is it leaking right now?
323,00:19:50.40,00:19:50.40,>> Yeah.>> Yep.
324,00:19:51.90,00:19:51.90,>> One of our pots now iscompletely unusable and the
325,00:19:54.03,00:19:54.03,"other one, you know, is still onits side and just, it's"
326,00:19:55.97,00:19:55.97,crumbling.Every time we put it in the fire
327,00:19:58.30,00:19:58.30,it crumbles more and more.>> Let's fill it up.
328,00:20:00.37,00:20:00.37,Who's got a gourd?>> Things began to slack off.
329,00:20:12.17,00:20:12.17,"You know, the water rations wentdown."
330,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,"My plan of attack was, you know,to let the comfort level drop"
331,00:20:17.70,00:20:17.70,"completely low, and theywould..."
332,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,"I know they would break down.And, uh, you could see that"
333,00:20:22.77,00:20:22.77,"things were falling apart.>> Oh, my gosh."
334,00:20:26.30,00:20:26.30,"Guys, we're in a heap oftrouble."
335,00:20:28.80,00:20:28.80,>> Can you save the bottom?Can you save it where it's
336,00:20:30.67,00:20:30.67,leaking out?>> Hold that side.
337,00:20:35.20,00:20:35.20,>> You ready?>> Let's see if we can lift it.
338,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,Lift it off the ground.Right there.
339,00:20:40.43,00:20:40.43,>> We now have completelyshattered all of our pots.
340,00:20:45.20,00:20:45.20,So it's a horrible situationthat we got ourselves into.
341,00:20:48.20,00:20:48.20,">> Huh.>> We are not in good shape,"
342,00:20:50.77,00:20:50.77,"boys and girls, I'll just saythat right now."
343,00:20:52.43,00:20:52.43,">> We'll make due, we'll makedue."
344,00:20:53.83,00:20:53.83,">> I'm still, like, God, thistribe, can we get our act"
345,00:20:55.43,00:20:55.43,"together?You know, there's still that"
346,00:20:57.67,00:20:57.67,"hanging over my head, like...what's wrong with us?"
347,00:21:01.20,00:21:01.20,"You know, we crack pots, wewhine, we complain, we have"
348,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73,"problems, people are fighting,da-da-da-da, whatever, and I'm"
349,00:21:06.53,00:21:06.53,"like, God, when are we going toget this together?"
350,00:21:18.70,00:21:18.70,"(screeching)>> What's up ahead, Tom?"
351,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60,>> Baboons.Looks like a pretty good tribe
352,00:21:23.33,00:21:23.33,of them.>> Best thing we can do is just
353,00:21:25.40,00:21:25.40,let them go.They let us go.
354,00:21:27.83,00:21:27.83,We're starting to be animal-friendly.
355,00:21:29.70,00:21:29.70,"Whatever they want, we'll do.>> Sometimes you do get"
356,00:21:32.67,00:21:32.67,"comfortable, a little bitcomfortable here, and, you know,"
357,00:21:35.50,00:21:35.50,you think you're all safe andeverything's great.
358,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,And then you get a wake-up call.(whistling)
359,00:21:40.27,00:21:40.27,">> Buffalo.>> Tom had his eyes up, thank"
360,00:21:43.90,00:21:43.90,God.>> Stand there.

362,00:21:52.63,00:21:52.63, one animal that we need to bemost careful of.
363,00:21:56.63,00:21:56.63,It's considered to be the mostdangerous animal in Africa.
364,00:22:00.20,00:22:00.20,">> You don't mess with this, youguys, you know?"
365,00:22:01.90,00:22:01.90,>> It was scary.It was there and it was huge.
366,00:22:04.57,00:22:04.57,"So when we saw this thing, wemade a lot of noise."
367,00:22:07.13,00:22:07.13,>> Ho!(whistling)
368,00:22:09.80,00:22:09.80,>> And then we realized at thatpoint we needed to leave this

421,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,we're going to look to ourAfrican hosts for a little
422,00:25:23.00,00:25:23.00,inspiration.The tribes of East Africa are
423,00:25:25.13,00:25:25.13,"nomadic, thus they areconstantly relocating their"
424,00:25:27.20,00:25:27.20,camp.That's what you guys are going
425,00:25:29.80,00:25:29.80,to do today.Each tribe has a camp with a
426,00:25:32.33,00:25:32.33,"hut, an animal pen, flagpole,and various camp supplies."
427,00:25:37.27,00:25:37.27,"First tribe to relocate theircamp up to your new home, 200"

429,00:25:45.87,00:25:45.87,immunity.Here are the rules.
430,00:25:48.47,00:25:48.47,Two members from each tribe willbe your architects.
431,00:25:52.40,00:25:52.40,Their job is to remember how thecamp looks here and to make sure
432,00:25:56.10,00:25:56.10,that it gets recreated exactlythe same way in your new home.
433,00:25:59.27,00:25:59.27,They will not help move thecamp.
434,00:26:01.27,00:26:01.27,They will be up at the newlocation.
435,00:26:02.97,00:26:02.97,And they can only help yourebuild once your pieces have
436,00:26:05.80,00:26:05.80,been placed inside your circle.The other members will be
437,00:26:08.83,00:26:08.83,responsible for actuallyphysically relocating the camp.
438,00:26:12.97,00:26:12.97,Last rule.The flagpole is the last thing

563,00:34:26.00,00:34:26.00,Because there's totally nothingin it for me.
564,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,">> Well, they wouldn't say who'sgoing tonight, but they had a"
565,00:34:32.13,00:34:32.13,"plan they wanted us to follow--you know, us now."

570,00:34:44.40,00:34:44.40,>> I do not want to see Silaswin the million dollars.
571,00:34:47.57,00:34:47.57,"I can see any of the other threewin the million dollars, but I"
572,00:34:50.00,00:34:50.00,don't want him winning themillion dollars.
573,00:34:51.70,00:34:51.70,"I don't trust him at all.There's something, there's"
574,00:34:54.30,00:34:54.30,something up there.I'm not even sure of his name.
575,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,There's just something not quiteright.
576,00:35:02.27,00:35:02.27,>> One of the three of you hasto go. I mean...

581,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,go ahead and finish?That was a bitter taste in
582,00:35:18.30,00:35:18.30,the mouth right there.>> I really don't know which way
583,00:35:20.93,00:35:20.93,"they're going, but I guessthere's a reason they could keep"
584,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,each one of us and a reason theycould decide to take each one of
585,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77,us off.>> Let's drop this.
586,00:35:27.73,00:35:27.73,Let's drop this.>> There's not an event in the
587,00:35:31.37,00:35:31.37,future that would alarm me.I can't wait until the merge
588,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90,because I plan on winning this.You might as well write the
589,00:35:37.87,00:35:37.87,"check and hand it to me, becauseI'm shooting for the stars,"
590,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57,and-and... I'm going to getthere.

619,00:37:30.77,00:37:30.77,is in trouble.That I can tell you for certain.

625,00:37:45.80,00:37:45.80,"at this point?>> Oh, there's always something"
626,00:37:47.13,00:37:47.13,to do.It's just waiting for the proper

671,00:42:03.87,00:42:03.87,That's a lot of votes after onlytwo Tribal Councils.
672,00:42:06.13,00:42:06.13,Could most definitely come intoplay in future votes.
673,00:42:09.03,00:42:09.03,>> No doubt.>> We know very well.
674,00:42:10.57,00:42:10.57,>> PROBST: I'll leave you withthis final thought.

682,00:43:05.47,00:43:05.47,"or lose, it's how you play thegame."
683,00:43:08.13,00:43:08.13,"I've grown, I've learned.It's just been great."
