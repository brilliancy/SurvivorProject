58,00:03:17.80,00:03:17.80,when we're not emotional.

70,00:03:37.20,00:03:37.20,"and all this stuff,"
71,00:03:38.37,00:03:38.37,"and it just proved rightnow that, you know,"
72,00:03:40.33,00:03:40.33,you guys just...are full of crap.
73,00:03:50.27,00:03:50.27,"- Uh, Tribal Council, and, uh,we had to go in there"
74,00:03:53.57,00:03:53.57,"and eliminate somebody,and, of course,"
75,00:03:54.83,00:03:54.83,it was going to be one
76,00:03:55.97,00:03:55.97,"of the three eldersof the tribe,"
77,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67,"uh, myself or Teresa or Linda."

79,00:04:01.70,00:04:01.70,"But, uh, that's the way it wasgoing to happen, we knew that."
80,00:04:05.37,00:04:05.37,"Uh, we are stilla tribe divided."
81,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,We're two tribes in one.
82,00:04:08.80,00:04:08.80,"Um, the youth,they think they can do it alone."
83,00:04:11.13,00:04:11.13,"They need us, and, uh,"
84,00:04:12.93,00:04:12.93,they basically just ignored usand cut us off.
85,00:04:15.30,00:04:15.30,"Keep isolating us, we're goingto keep fighting, you know?"
86,00:04:17.20,00:04:17.20,"I haven't seen an invitationcome across the board, so..."
87,00:04:20.50,00:04:20.50,"- Hey, it's a game,which they utter every minute,"

92,00:04:33.50,00:04:33.50,and it feels good.
93,00:04:46.53,00:04:46.53,"- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,they definitely set up mine,"
94,00:04:50.90,00:04:50.90,"up Silas, and A.K.A."
95,00:04:54.77,00:04:54.77,"They weren't here to playthe game last night, you know."
96,00:04:56.67,00:04:56.67,"They were there for revengefor them to show,"
97,00:04:58.70,00:04:58.70,"""Ah, kiss my ass,"" you know."
98,00:04:59.77,00:04:59.77,"""We have the power."

100,00:05:02.53,00:05:02.53,"And, you know, again, it justshows the older group's maturity"
101,00:05:04.70,00:05:04.70,"level, and, again, it's a gameand, you know, no big deal."
102,00:05:08.07,00:05:08.07,- I'm not used toall these emotional people.
103,00:05:10.73,00:05:10.73,"This is a game and, you know,we're supposed to be thinking."
104,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10,"Whether they believe it or not,"
105,00:05:15.30,00:05:15.30,we have to havethose two people.
106,00:05:17.53,00:05:17.53,"I mean, we have to win one moreimmunity challenge,"
107,00:05:19.63,00:05:19.63,or it doesn't matter what we door how many votes we have.
108,00:05:21.93,00:05:21.93,We're all screwed.
109,00:05:23.33,00:05:23.33,It's very frustrating for meto see a clear picture and have
110,00:05:25.67,00:05:25.67,"these people around me just,like, living in the momentand not having any--"
111,00:05:30.10,00:05:30.10,"Like, not caring at all thatthe things they say are really--"

202,00:09:33.73,00:09:33.73,- Yeah.
203,00:09:35.57,00:09:35.57,- So welcome! Come here!
204,00:09:37.20,00:09:37.20,"- Oh, my God, are you kidding?"
205,00:09:39.00,00:09:39.00,"- Something is up, though."
206,00:09:40.70,00:09:40.70,- That's people from theirtribe coming to us.
207,00:09:43.33,00:09:43.33,- It is?
208,00:09:44.97,00:09:44.97,"- When I saw them coming up,I thought they were going to try"
209,00:09:46.93,00:09:46.93,"to, like, steal our flagor get some info from us"
210,00:09:50.37,00:09:50.37,or check on our house.
211,00:09:51.97,00:09:51.97,"- Clarence, Ethan, Jim!"
212,00:09:55.60,00:09:55.60,- We're switching homes?- I'm Boran. Silas.
213,00:09:59.40,00:09:59.40,- Yeah? Holy...
214,00:10:01.80,00:10:01.80,It was a switch.
215,00:10:04.10,00:10:04.10,"They're, like,""We're on your side now,"""
216,00:10:06.13,00:10:06.13,"and my stomach dropped,"
217,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,"because everythingI had worked for,"
218,00:10:09.57,00:10:09.57,"all the bonds I had made,"
219,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,two closest friendson the team were now gone.
220,00:10:14.63,00:10:14.63,"And I was, like, ""I'm goingto have to start over."""
221,00:10:16.77,00:10:16.77,"Oh, man. Nice.You guys have a roof on yours?"
222,00:10:19.80,00:10:19.80,- Yeah.- You built a roof?
223,00:10:21.30,00:10:21.30,- Yeah.- Is it nice?
224,00:10:22.93,00:10:22.93,- We built a roof and we put...
225,00:10:24.10,00:10:24.10,"in the day in the heat,we put blankets over it"
226,00:10:26.47,00:10:26.47,and put blankets down for shade.
227,00:10:28.73,00:10:28.73,"This is all our... you know,the creek water here."
228,00:10:31.73,00:10:31.73,"My old tribe,I had an alliance"
229,00:10:34.60,00:10:34.60,with fourof the young people.
230,00:10:36.13,00:10:36.13,"Now as far as the situation,you know, yeah,"
231,00:10:37.77,00:10:37.77,it's not that great.
232,00:10:38.97,00:10:38.97,"I mean, I came here withthe two people"
233,00:10:40.17,00:10:40.17,"that I didn't probablywant to come here with,"
234,00:10:41.57,00:10:41.57,"and you know,left three of my buddies"
235,00:10:42.87,00:10:42.87,"back at the other camp,and that was kind of tough."
236,00:10:45.87,00:10:45.87,"I mean, we're just..."
237,00:10:46.97,00:10:46.97,our minds right noware going crazy.
238,00:10:56.23,00:10:56.23,- Is that what they'relooking for?
239,00:10:57.60,00:10:57.60,"- Yeah, yeah.- Yeah, absolutely gorgeous."
240,00:10:59.53,00:10:59.53,Careful-- we're trying not tolet the rice drop because
241,00:11:00.67,00:11:00.67,if it expands in their...
242,00:11:01.73,00:11:01.73,- We have really good food.
243,00:11:03.00,00:11:03.00,"You know, the water's kindof like mud here,"
244,00:11:04.13,00:11:04.13,but the food's really good.
245,00:11:05.47,00:11:05.47,So there's kind of a trade-off.
246,00:11:07.03,00:11:07.03,- So what do you guysdo all day?
247,00:11:08.47,00:11:08.47,Do you lounge around like we do?
248,00:11:10.00,00:11:10.00,- There's a lot of lounging.
249,00:11:11.50,00:11:11.50,- All of us-- and I'm sure theold Samburu felt the same way--
250,00:11:14.50,00:11:14.50,all of us had been so carefulabout arranging our strategies
251,00:11:18.83,00:11:18.83,and arranging for our ownsecurity and well-being...
252,00:11:24.80,00:11:24.80,"that, all of a sudden,"
253,00:11:26.13,00:11:26.13,all of that was completelyblown asunder.
254,00:11:28.27,00:11:28.27,How's the firewood?Do you guys have a lot of wood?
255,00:11:30.37,00:11:30.37,- No.- No.
256,00:11:31.90,00:11:31.90,"- Are you guys struggling, too?"
257,00:11:32.97,00:11:32.97,"- We have tons stored up,though."
258,00:11:34.70,00:11:34.70,- You should see how muchwe stored up.
259,00:11:36.20,00:11:36.20,We stored up enoughfor the next week.
260,00:11:37.87,00:11:37.87,- I'm so pissed off.
261,00:11:39.10,00:11:39.10,"- You think you're on topone minute,"
262,00:11:40.40,00:11:40.40,and then we just hadthis incredible loop thrown
263,00:11:43.00,00:11:43.00,"towards us, and, you know..."
264,00:11:45.50,00:11:45.50,"just this kink in the loopthat just threw everything off,"
265,00:11:49.23,00:11:49.23,all confidence completelydown the drain.
266,00:11:52.80,00:11:52.80,"- This is amazing, y'all."
267,00:11:56.27,00:11:56.27,"- You know, I don't mind"
268,00:11:57.40,00:11:57.40,"playing the cardsthey've dealt me,"
269,00:11:59.03,00:11:59.03,and I'm taking it likea little man.
270,00:12:02.00,00:12:02.00,"I put a smileon my face this morning,"
271,00:12:03.90,00:12:03.90,but I had to move ita little bit.
272,00:12:06.03,00:12:06.03,- Whoa.
273,00:12:07.20,00:12:07.20,"- Oh, it's all coming outthe back."
274,00:12:08.80,00:12:08.80,"- Oh, gosh, watch it."
275,00:12:10.30,00:12:10.30,"- Okay, we should have madea bigger depression in there."
276,00:12:12.20,00:12:12.20,"- We were, we were pissed aboutthe fact that when we got there,"
277,00:12:15.23,00:12:15.23,it looked like a bunch oflazy people
278,00:12:17.07,00:12:17.07,had been running the camp.
279,00:12:18.57,00:12:18.57,"You know, can you lift it up,so I can just dig a pit for it?"
280,00:12:20.83,00:12:20.83,"There was a mound of ash,you know,"
281,00:12:22.97,00:12:22.97,a foot-and-a-half high.
282,00:12:24.43,00:12:24.43,They hadn't really been takingcare of their fire properly.
283,00:12:27.17,00:12:27.17,There was almostno firewood inside the camp.
284,00:12:29.47,00:12:29.47,"And one of my first questionswas, you know,"
285,00:12:31.67,00:12:31.67,"""Where's all the firewood?"""
286,00:12:33.03,00:12:33.03,And so you're all more thanwelcome to look around.
287,00:12:34.40,00:12:34.40,There's the firewood--
288,00:12:35.60,00:12:35.60,we've pretty much yankedall the firewood.
289,00:12:37.33,00:12:37.33,- We can all do a firewood runafter we go to the water hole.
290,00:12:40.07,00:12:40.07,"- Yeah, but, I mean,there's just not much around."
291,00:12:54.27,00:12:54.27,- We've all... we've workedreally hard and suffered a lot
292,00:12:56.70,00:12:56.70,"with no food and no waterand stuff like that,"
293,00:12:58.57,00:12:58.57,and just to seepeople out here who just...
294,00:13:00.40,00:13:00.40,"don't take it seriouslyand be stuck with them,"
295,00:13:03.17,00:13:03.17,it's painful.
296,00:13:04.30,00:13:04.30,- Did you find the map?- I didn't look.
297,00:13:06.67,00:13:06.67,- We kind of made a little pathwith rocks.
298,00:13:11.93,00:13:11.93,It's really mushy.
299,00:13:13.80,00:13:13.80,"If you step in the wrong spot,you'll sink."
300,00:13:16.03,00:13:16.03,"- Now go left.- Oh, left?"
301,00:13:19.07,00:13:19.07,"- Yeah, now go left."
302,00:13:20.77,00:13:20.77,- And then straight?
303,00:13:22.13,00:13:22.13,Do we go over the dry riverbed?
304,00:13:23.37,00:13:23.37,"- No, go along it."
305,00:13:24.87,00:13:24.87,- There's a path right there.- Oh.
306,00:13:26.03,00:13:26.03,- Go north.- Okay.
307,00:13:27.50,00:13:27.50,"It was obvious that these peoplewere napping all day,"
308,00:13:29.90,00:13:29.90,and thatthey weren't doing squat.
309,00:13:35.23,00:13:35.23,This is mud.
310,00:13:36.97,00:13:36.97,"- They've been drinking outof a mud hole, like hell."
311,00:13:41.10,00:13:41.10,- Hi.- Hello.
312,00:13:43.23,00:13:43.23,"- Yeah, it's pretty harsh, huh?"
313,00:13:44.47,00:13:44.47,"- Yeah.- Yeah, this is sick."
314,00:13:46.80,00:13:46.80,"Oh, my God,it's even dirtier today."
315,00:13:48.67,00:13:48.67,- It's really bad.- We've been clearing it out.
316,00:13:50.77,00:13:50.77,- Yuck!- ...clean my feet.
317,00:13:52.73,00:13:52.73,- Do you guysdo laundry in this?
318,00:13:55.03,00:13:55.03,- Yeah.- I don't know.
319,00:13:56.93,00:13:56.93,They keep waiting fora mysterious thing
320,00:13:57.87,00:13:57.87,to happen here in Africa--
321,00:13:58.87,00:13:58.87,"wood's gonna fallout of the sky,"
322,00:14:00.50,00:14:00.50,there's going to be an artesianwell coming up in the camp.
323,00:14:03.83,00:14:03.83,"I don't know,maybe a swimming pool."
324,00:14:06.07,00:14:06.07,"But I don't thinkthat's going to happen,"
325,00:14:07.73,00:14:07.73,and I feel like we're goingto have to get out there
326,00:14:11.07,00:14:11.07,and pull the plow.
327,00:14:13.23,00:14:13.23,♪♪
328,00:14:24.03,00:14:24.03,- You want small stuff.
329,00:14:25.63,00:14:25.63,"- All this stuff burns,like, a madman."
330,00:14:28.13,00:14:28.13,- I'm definitely onthe other side right now.
331,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,"I was on the good side,now I'm on the bad side."
332,00:14:32.83,00:14:32.83,This twist in the game hasreally stuck a thorn in my side.
333,00:14:36.70,00:14:36.70,- I wanted this.I wanted you on my team anyway.
334,00:14:39.03,00:14:39.03,"- I know,that's what I said, man."
335,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33,"- I said, ""If you, like,give me him, we'll be straight."""
336,00:14:42.53,00:14:42.53,- Do you think this is a coolthing to have happened?
337,00:14:45.00,00:14:45.00,"- Frank and I thought,""Are we going down this way?"""
338,00:14:47.10,00:14:47.10,- Right.
339,00:14:48.10,00:14:48.10,"- Just because the four,you know..."
340,00:14:50.00,00:14:50.00,"- Obviously, either youor Frank was next."
341,00:14:51.20,00:14:51.20,- Right.- Yeah.
342,00:14:52.50,00:14:52.50,"- Frank and T, this has justrejuvenated their life."
343,00:14:54.30,00:14:54.30,"- I mean, this is like a wholenew opportunity for them,you know,"
344,00:14:57.33,00:14:57.33,because they knew at leastone of them was going
345,00:14:59.00,00:14:59.00,to go the next vote.
346,00:15:00.63,00:15:00.63,"- All this happening today,Frank and I looked at each other"
347,00:15:03.33,00:15:03.33,"and thought, you know..."
348,00:15:04.57,00:15:04.57,- We're alive again.
349,00:15:08.97,00:15:08.97,(elephants trumpet)
350,00:15:09.97,00:15:09.97,"- There's, like, nine of them."
351,00:15:11.57,00:15:11.57,- They're there.
352,00:15:12.87,00:15:12.87,"- Oh, yeah, I see them rightthrough here, actually,"
353,00:15:14.27,00:15:14.27,right there.
354,00:15:15.40,00:15:15.40,- I don't see the babies.
355,00:15:16.90,00:15:16.90,"- I see this large one comingup behind this one, as well."
356,00:15:18.67,00:15:18.67,- It's nice... there's atrumpeting of the elephant.
357,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67,Magnificent creature this close.
358,00:15:24.27,00:15:24.27,Unbelievable.
359,00:15:25.37,00:15:25.37,(low rumbling)
360,00:15:35.90,00:15:35.90,"- Even in the face of defeat,we're not going down."
361,00:15:38.77,00:15:38.77,"You never give up,absolutely not,"
362,00:15:39.90,00:15:39.90,right till the end.
363,00:15:41.00,00:15:41.00,Not till I'm six feetunderground.
364,00:15:43.17,00:15:43.17,"- So they were asking you guysto vote with them,"
365,00:15:44.37,00:15:44.37,but they wouldn't tell youwhich one of you
366,00:15:45.43,00:15:45.43,they were going to vote off?- Right.
367,00:15:47.50,00:15:47.50,"That's how bad it was,you know, it was just..."
368,00:15:51.07,00:15:51.07,And when they triedto tell Teresa
369,00:15:52.43,00:15:52.43,to vote for Lindseybecause they wanted Lindsey
370,00:15:56.17,00:15:56.17,to keep all the strikesagainst her...
371,00:15:57.20,00:15:57.20,- Who said to vote for Lindsey?
372,00:15:58.50,00:15:58.50,Those same peopletold to you vote for...
373,00:16:00.73,00:16:00.73,- All four of them.- They wanted to keep...
374,00:16:02.63,00:16:02.63,"So the other threewouldn't get any,"
375,00:16:05.20,00:16:05.20,"because they were an alliance,they weren't going to break up,"
376,00:16:07.07,00:16:07.07,so as long as they hadthe control...
377,00:16:09.53,00:16:09.53,"- It's even betterthey told Linda and Teresa, """
378,00:16:12.90,00:16:12.90,"Now, you guys vote like thatand we'll drag you along."""
379,00:16:16.80,00:16:16.80,"- So both times you guys wentto Tribal Council, it was,"
380,00:16:18.70,00:16:18.70,"like, all out war."
381,00:16:20.63,00:16:20.63,"- And I told you never give up,right, girl?"
382,00:16:22.60,00:16:22.60,- You did.- Not till the end.
383,00:16:50.47,00:16:50.47,- This is now Samburu tribe.
384,00:16:52.23,00:16:52.23,I'm not on the Samburu tribe.
385,00:16:53.47,00:16:53.47,The red is a red herring.
386,00:16:54.57,00:16:54.57,It's a false front.
387,00:16:55.83,00:16:55.83,I'm still on Boranand so is Lex and so is Tom.
388,00:16:58.67,00:16:58.67,- We've been herdinga castrated bull
389,00:17:01.70,00:17:01.70,is what we've been herding.
390,00:17:03.33,00:17:03.33,And there... we've got a queerand two girls as tight
391,00:17:05.63,00:17:05.63,as a banger hide.
392,00:17:08.03,00:17:08.03,And I don't think we canget rid of Brandon.
393,00:17:10.00,00:17:10.00,I think we're gonna have to tryto go for Lindsey.
394,00:17:12.47,00:17:12.47,She's a whiner.
395,00:17:13.70,00:17:13.70,"But, hell,they're out here doing..."
396,00:17:15.57,00:17:15.57,We've inherited a campthat ain't done nothing.
397,00:17:18.97,00:17:18.97,- I think Brandon's got
398,00:17:21.30,00:17:21.30,"at least a vote against him,though."
399,00:17:23.13,00:17:23.13,- You think that?- Uh-huh.
400,00:17:24.70,00:17:24.70,I think Frank--I think Frank voted for him.
401,00:17:27.30,00:17:27.30,"Hey, you guys didn't dothree hours, did you?"
402,00:17:30.50,00:17:30.50,- I tried.
403,00:17:31.90,00:17:31.90,I thought we were out therefor at least two-and-a-half.
404,00:17:33.67,00:17:33.67,- Let's don't get caughthuddled up.
405,00:17:39.67,00:17:39.67,- I hate this game.

407,00:17:45.63,00:17:45.63,It's not even a question.
408,00:17:46.80,00:17:46.80,"I guarantee you,"
409,00:17:48.10,00:17:48.10,none of these people havefour votes against them.
410,00:17:50.30,00:17:50.30,- We have to anticipate goingto Tribal Council
411,00:17:52.03,00:17:52.03,because we're out-mannedso drastically.
412,00:17:55.13,00:17:55.13,"If this challengeis in any way physical,"
413,00:17:56.67,00:17:56.67,I don't see the pointin playing.
414,00:17:58.67,00:17:58.67,We will lose.
415,00:17:59.80,00:17:59.80,- But I thinkwe will lose today.

417,00:18:03.77,00:18:03.77,- Why?
418,00:18:05.10,00:18:05.10,- Because they have Silasand Clarence and Ethan.
419,00:18:07.70,00:18:07.70,"- Oh, man."
420,00:18:09.03,00:18:09.03,"- The good part about it is,that me, Lex and Tom"
421,00:18:12.67,00:18:12.67,have no votes against us.
422,00:18:13.70,00:18:13.70,- Good morning.- How are you?
423,00:18:15.47,00:18:15.47,"- So no matter who they pick,we should be okay as long as"
424,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,we pick the one of themthat has votes against them.
425,00:18:21.73,00:18:21.73,Tom and I and Lex have all sortof whispered a little bit.
426,00:18:25.20,00:18:25.20,"They talk too loud, though, too."
427,00:18:26.63,00:18:26.63,"You've got to watch becauseof the eavesdropping, of course,"
428,00:18:28.57,00:18:28.57,goes both ways.
429,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,(birds screeching)
430,00:18:30.67,00:18:30.67,"Whoa, birds, God."

432,00:18:36.13,00:18:36.13,"Well, I mean, that's not true."
433,00:18:37.33,00:18:37.33,"I like Kim a lot, too,"
434,00:18:38.87,00:18:38.87,but Kim is just so much moreof a physical threat.
435,00:18:40.40,00:18:40.40,"And then Lindsey, everyonethinks is really annoying."
436,00:18:43.07,00:18:43.07,Aw...

444,00:19:06.07,00:19:06.07,- I think he's just gonna popright off when I get him.
445,00:19:10.10,00:19:10.10,(groans)
446,00:19:11.13,00:19:11.13,- Hold still..
447,00:19:13.00,00:19:13.00,"- Okay, that's hot,that's really hot."
448,00:19:15.33,00:19:15.33,"- Lindsey had a tickon her butt,"
449,00:19:17.13,00:19:17.13,"and tell you the truth,"
450,00:19:18.33,00:19:18.33,"when a woman had troubleon her butt,"
451,00:19:20.17,00:19:20.17,I told her that's justwhat I was made for.
452,00:19:22.57,00:19:22.57,(groaning)
453,00:19:24.60,00:19:24.60,- Ow!

456,00:19:34.20,00:19:34.20,- Looks like he's...
457,00:19:39.20,00:19:39.20,"See, he's already moving,he's not happy."
458,00:19:43.10,00:19:43.10,Is that all right?
459,00:19:44.33,00:19:44.33,- Son of a...
460,00:19:45.80,00:19:45.80,"- I think pretty soon,"
461,00:19:47.00,00:19:47.00,"we can pull him, he's just goingto come out."

470,00:20:22.70,00:20:22.70,- Getting my first look

550,00:25:27.90,00:25:27.90,was kind ofweird in the beginning.
551,00:25:29.37,00:25:29.37,"You know, it was definitelyannoying to see Silas and Frank"
552,00:25:32.87,00:25:32.87,"were really, like,blocking us"
553,00:25:35.30,00:25:35.30,from getting intothe little corals.
554,00:25:36.73,00:25:36.73,"It was frustrating just becauseit's, like, Silas, you know,"
555,00:25:39.33,00:25:39.33,it's somebody we wereworking together with
556,00:25:41.37,00:25:41.37,"and now he's workingagainst you,"
557,00:25:43.40,00:25:43.40,so it wasvery frustrating.

564,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,It's luck.
565,00:25:58.87,00:25:58.87,We didn't knowthis was going to happen.
566,00:26:00.37,00:26:00.37,- Can't vote for me.
567,00:26:04.37,00:26:04.37,(sniffles)
568,00:26:05.77,00:26:05.77,There's no stability out here.
569,00:26:07.67,00:26:07.67,"It's just, like, walking onegg shells every second, and..."

572,00:26:17.60,00:26:17.60,"you know, we just hadthis new team appear"
573,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,"and we're all stressed out,"
574,00:26:22.33,00:26:22.33,and I'm just emotionalover it all.
575,00:26:24.33,00:26:24.33,"You know, I've madethese great new friends,"
576,00:26:26.73,00:26:26.73,and I'm so excited to leavewith this experience
577,00:26:28.63,00:26:28.63,"because it's awesome,"
578,00:26:29.97,00:26:29.97,but I'm not ready to leave yetand I'm terrified.
579,00:26:32.60,00:26:32.60,I don't want to go.
580,00:26:33.73,00:26:33.73,- I don't care.

586,00:26:43.77,00:26:43.77,she's just running scaredthey're going to vote for her.
587,00:26:45.43,00:26:45.43,"And she doesn't care that we'retrying so extra hard, Kim and I,"
588,00:26:48.50,00:26:48.50,to keep that from happening.
589,00:26:50.33,00:26:50.33,"- You guys, I almost criedwhen I saw Silas"
590,00:26:52.60,00:26:52.60,"and then after the challenge,"
591,00:26:53.53,00:26:53.53,I wanted to punch him out.
592,00:26:54.90,00:26:54.90,"- I will find a way to get themto vote for me tomorrow,"

606,00:27:19.77,00:27:19.77,They'll back you upand they'll vote for
607,00:27:21.03,00:27:21.03,"whoever you tell themto vote for,"
608,00:27:22.17,00:27:22.17,but you have totell them who to vote for.
609,00:27:23.57,00:27:23.57,You have to tell themwhat to do.
610,00:27:24.63,00:27:24.63,"You have to tell them, look,"
611,00:27:25.90,00:27:25.90,"""You don't need to beso nice today, Kim."
612,00:27:27.47,00:27:27.47,"You need to bea little bit bitchy,"
613,00:27:28.77,00:27:28.77,"so that they'll haveanother choice besides Lindsey,"
614,00:27:30.30,00:27:30.30,"because we're both screwedif do you that."""
615,00:27:31.73,00:27:31.73,"When you have to think ofeverything,"
616,00:27:33.00,00:27:33.00,and then all they dois cry and whine and moan
617,00:27:35.83,00:27:35.83,"and bitch and complainall the time,"
618,00:27:37.43,00:27:37.43,I'm just like...
619,00:27:38.53,00:27:38.53,It's such a great thingthat I'm gay
620,00:27:40.53,00:27:40.53,because I could not stand toput up with a crying woman now.
621,00:27:42.87,00:27:42.87,I couldn't do it.
622,00:27:51.13,00:27:51.13,"- So from your team,Lindsey has four votes?"
623,00:27:53.53,00:27:53.53,Or she has more than that?
624,00:27:54.67,00:27:54.67,"- She, uh, has four."
625,00:27:57.50,00:27:57.50,"- Then me and her,if it came down to it,"
626,00:27:59.90,00:27:59.90,we'd be tied.
627,00:28:01.77,00:28:01.77,- I see what you mean because...
628,00:28:04.03,00:28:04.03,- They'll try and hit me.
629,00:28:05.23,00:28:05.23,All the immunity challengesare huge to us.
630,00:28:07.07,00:28:07.07,"This one coming up is just astepping-stone to the next one,"
631,00:28:09.83,00:28:09.83,especially for Silas and I.
632,00:28:11.47,00:28:11.47,"We have bull's-eyes on us,no doubt,"
633,00:28:13.23,00:28:13.23,so we got to make the mostout of having both of us
634,00:28:15.73,00:28:15.73,on the same tribe.
635,00:28:17.13,00:28:17.13,Take a big lead and then pickoff the others one by one.
636,00:28:20.07,00:28:20.07,"- (whispering) If we starttelling him to vote for Silas,"
637,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,I don't trust him.
638,00:28:23.27,00:28:23.27,I think he might go to Silas
639,00:28:24.77,00:28:24.77,and tell him because he's tryingto be buddies with Silas.
640,00:28:26.27,00:28:26.27,"Ethan thinks up over him becausehe thinks he has, you know..."
641,00:28:29.57,00:28:29.57,"- He won't come to one of youguys and say,"
642,00:28:31.60,00:28:31.60,"""Let's get off the big guy?"""
643,00:28:33.83,00:28:33.83,- No. He thinks they're makingsome bond together.
644,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,He's very foolish that way.
645,00:28:37.70,00:28:37.70,"I mean, he really believes thatthe two of them can go into it"
646,00:28:40.43,00:28:40.43,"and win the thing,the two of them together, so..."
647,00:28:44.60,00:28:44.60,"- Oh, I just figured he'd gowith him, so..."
648,00:28:46.30,00:28:46.30,- I don't thinkhe'll vote for Silas.
649,00:28:48.03,00:28:48.03,- Okay.
650,00:28:49.10,00:28:49.10,♪♪
651,00:28:53.87,00:28:53.87,"- I've talked with Kim,I'm like,"
652,00:28:54.97,00:28:54.97,"""Kim, this may sound crazy"
653,00:28:56.40,00:28:56.40,"and I've never done thisin my life,"
654,00:28:57.60,00:28:57.60,"I'm an athlete,I go out to win,"
655,00:28:59.70,00:28:59.70,"I've never fixed anything."""
656,00:29:01.37,00:29:01.37,"I'm like,""What would you think if we lost"
657,00:29:03.90,00:29:03.90,"this next challengeon purpose?"""
658,00:29:05.97,00:29:05.97,It's going to be very toughfor me not to win this.
659,00:29:07.83,00:29:07.83,"I mean, I'll be honest with you"
660,00:29:10.20,00:29:10.20,because I've never done thatin my life.
661,00:29:13.30,00:29:13.30,- Only two more immunitychallenges before the merger.
662,00:29:15.37,00:29:15.37,I talked with Kimand also with Ethan...
663,00:29:18.47,00:29:18.47,"that if we didn't win this one,that was okay."
664,00:29:21.80,00:29:21.80,- Immunity challenge isa win-win situation.
665,00:29:24.60,00:29:24.60,"We win the challenge, great--"
666,00:29:27.00,00:29:27.00,we don't haveto go to Tribal Council.
667,00:29:28.53,00:29:28.53,"We lose, we end up goingto Tribal Council"
668,00:29:31.57,00:29:31.57,"and I get to vote off, you know,my biggest threat."
669,00:29:35.70,00:29:35.70,- We all ready?
670,00:29:37.90,00:29:37.90,(exhales)
671,00:29:51.83,00:29:51.83,- Take it back.
672,00:29:52.93,00:29:52.93,Immunity is back up for grabs.
673,00:29:54.63,00:29:54.63,"Today's immunity challengeis very simple,"
674,00:29:57.27,00:29:57.27,as simple as it gets.
675,00:29:58.43,00:29:58.43,Behind you guys are 20 piecesto a puzzle.
676,00:30:00.67,00:30:00.67,The first tribe to putthe puzzle back together
677,00:30:02.97,00:30:02.97,correctly wins.
678,00:30:05.63,00:30:05.63,One key element: you mustwork together as a tribe.
679,00:30:09.27,00:30:09.27,"You don't have team work,you will lose."
680,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,"For the winners, at leastthree more days in Africa,"
681,00:30:14.43,00:30:14.43,one step closer to the merge.
682,00:30:16.07,00:30:16.07,"For the losers,another visit to Tribal Council,"
683,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,another membervoted out of your tribe.
684,00:30:20.03,00:30:20.03,I'll give you guysa couple of minutes
685,00:30:21.20,00:30:21.20,to figure out your strategy.
686,00:30:22.37,00:30:22.37,Wait for my go.
687,00:30:25.33,00:30:25.33,- Tall guys grabthe higher pieces.
688,00:30:27.20,00:30:27.20,- You are the center man.
689,00:30:28.87,00:30:28.87,You tell us whatto get
690,00:30:30.10,00:30:30.10,and we'll grab it and we'llbring it back.
691,00:30:31.30,00:30:31.30,- Immunity at stake.

702,00:31:11.77,00:31:11.77,Move these.
703,00:31:13.17,00:31:13.17,- Does this go up top?Does this go with the head?
704,00:31:14.90,00:31:14.90,This is the head. Come on.

719,00:31:42.60,00:31:42.60,We need a sharp point.
720,00:31:44.03,00:31:44.03,"Right there, Ethan."
721,00:31:45.20,00:31:45.20,Does that fit?
722,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,"No, that doesn't fit."
723,00:31:47.23,00:31:47.23,- It goes down here!

759,00:33:20.57,00:33:20.57,"- You know what'scoming next, right?"
760,00:33:23.23,00:33:23.23,"Tribal Council, tonight."
761,00:33:24.60,00:33:24.60,You're goingto lose another member.
762,00:33:26.60,00:33:26.60,- Don't worry about it.Good work.
763,00:33:50.93,00:33:50.93,"- Me and Silas had it out,over in the bushes."
764,00:33:53.63,00:33:53.63,"He's like, ""Ethan, let's go getsome wood."""
765,00:33:55.93,00:33:55.93,"I'm like, okay, we're going tohave a meeting."
766,00:33:58.07,00:33:58.07,"- Let me tell you this, Frankstabbed everybody in my tribe in"
767,00:33:59.63,00:33:59.63,the back.
768,00:34:01.23,00:34:01.23,"He would have been gone a longtime ago, but we needed"
769,00:34:03.13,00:34:03.13,a strength.
770,00:34:04.40,00:34:04.40,"- Meanwhile, in my head I'm,like, I like Frank."
771,00:34:06.60,00:34:06.60,"- I don't know, just God..."
772,00:34:12.40,00:34:12.40,He's the most manipulative ofthem all.
773,00:34:15.43,00:34:15.43,"And I'm like, well, I seeClarence as a threat to me"
774,00:34:18.43,00:34:18.43,come the merger.
775,00:34:19.83,00:34:19.83,- I don't see Frank as a threatto me at all.
776,00:34:22.13,00:34:22.13,- I don't either.
777,00:34:23.67,00:34:23.67,"- I have a tough time withClarence, and that's what it"
778,00:34:25.23,00:34:25.23,comes down to and I don't wanthim here anymore.
779,00:34:27.37,00:34:27.37,It's as simple as that.
780,00:34:28.70,00:34:28.70,I haven't wanted him here sinceday three.
781,00:34:30.40,00:34:30.40,"- I mean... T and Frank,I think I can get them to,"
782,00:34:33.03,00:34:33.03,you know...
783,00:34:34.90,00:34:34.90,- Vote for Clarence?
784,00:34:35.97,00:34:35.97,- Mm-hmm.
785,00:34:42.80,00:34:42.80,"- Ethan and Kim, they've hadtheir problems, I guess,"
786,00:34:44.33,00:34:44.33,with Clarence.
787,00:34:45.87,00:34:45.87,"They'd like to see him out,so I don't think he's got"
788,00:34:48.07,00:34:48.07,the cards in his handon this one.
789,00:34:49.63,00:34:49.63,This one'sgoing to slip through.
790,00:34:53.43,00:34:53.43,"- (Kim)Clarence's past experienceshave been relayed to Teresa,"
791,00:34:57.10,00:34:57.10,"Silas and Frank, the fact thatClarence ate seventh-eighths of"
792,00:35:00.43,00:35:00.43,"the can of food, and that he hadno permission to do it."
793,00:35:03.03,00:35:03.03,And I think there have beenrumblings with the new tribe
794,00:35:05.57,00:35:05.57,members that we've had someissues of trust with Clarence.
795,00:35:10.93,00:35:10.93,"Silas makes Ethan verynervous, and I think that he has"
796,00:35:13.87,00:35:13.87,very strong connections in hisother tribe.
797,00:35:19.77,00:35:19.77,Are you in an alliance at all?
798,00:35:21.03,00:35:21.03,"- Well, with the three thatwere left behind."
799,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,"It's, like,Ethan and Lex and Tom."
800,00:35:26.97,00:35:26.97,"More than anything, I want toget to the merger."
801,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,- So you are in alliancewith the three others?
802,00:35:31.07,00:35:31.07,"- No,when I say alliance..."
803,00:35:32.40,00:35:32.40,It was just personality-wise.There was no alliance.
804,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90,"- No, well, I'm glad you toldme because I didn't realize that"
805,00:35:36.40,00:35:36.40,"you were so tight with, like,three other ones that were"
806,00:35:38.53,00:35:38.53,"already there, and so that'ssort of why it's important you"
807,00:35:40.23,00:35:40.23,"get to the merger, maybe, too."
808,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,"- I mean, I came to win,obviously."
809,00:35:43.87,00:35:43.87,"- Right, right."
810,00:35:44.93,00:35:44.93,"- I mean, there's only..."
811,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,- Right.
812,00:35:47.70,00:35:47.70,He may be a real nice guy inreal life.
813,00:35:49.63,00:35:49.63,"In our tribe,I don't buy his schmooziness."
814,00:35:52.20,00:35:52.20,"- I mean, hey, look at meright now."
815,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50,Let's go get some firewood.
816,00:36:00.77,00:36:00.77,I went to get wood with Ethanand just kind of wanted to pick
817,00:36:03.73,00:36:03.73,"his brain, and he said he wantedto get rid of Clarence, and I"
818,00:36:06.90,00:36:06.90,think he has some ill feelingstowards Clarence and I know Kim
819,00:36:09.07,00:36:09.07,"does too, and, hopefully, thoseare strong enough to convince T"
820,00:36:12.60,00:36:12.60,"and Frank, and vote for him andthen he'll go off."
821,00:36:15.00,00:36:15.00,What did you talk to Clarenceabout?
822,00:36:16.40,00:36:16.40,- I told Clarence because I sawyou talking to Kim.
823,00:36:18.10,00:36:18.10,"I'm like, Clarence, I thinkthere's a plot against me."
824,00:36:19.80,00:36:19.80,"- See, Ethan, this is my logic."
825,00:36:21.43,00:36:21.43,"I think you're all against me,now."
826,00:36:23.13,00:36:23.13,"Come on, man, look mein the eye."
827,00:36:26.10,00:36:26.10,- I'll look you in the eye.
828,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,"This morning, I thought weagreed on Clarence."
829,00:36:31.20,00:36:31.20,- Frank and T are goingto probably vote for me.
830,00:36:33.40,00:36:33.40,- I thought they were with you.
831,00:36:34.63,00:36:34.63,You said they werewith you this morning.
832,00:36:35.80,00:36:35.80,You were going to get theirvotes.
833,00:36:37.53,00:36:37.53,"- Well, which onedo you want to take?"
834,00:36:38.93,00:36:38.93,"- That's what I'm saying.- Well, let's decide, damn it."
835,00:36:40.73,00:36:40.73,"- I thought you were, I thoughtyou were 100%..."
836,00:36:42.63,00:36:42.63,(both talking at once)...something about T and Frank
837,00:36:45.63,00:36:45.63,getting Clarence.
838,00:36:47.23,00:36:47.23,I thought we were going to befive against one.
839,00:36:48.77,00:36:48.77,"- You, me and Clarence aregoing to vote for Frank."
840,00:36:50.83,00:36:50.83,I don't think Kim wants tovote for Frank.
841,00:36:53.03,00:36:53.03,Who does she want to votefor?
842,00:36:54.83,00:36:54.83,"- Clarence, if anyone."
843,00:36:56.03,00:36:56.03,- I'm dying to see what's goingto happen.
844,00:36:57.63,00:36:57.63,"It's tough, but I definitelyknow it's going to be probably"
845,00:36:59.83,00:36:59.83,myself or Clarence.
846,00:37:01.07,00:37:01.07,It's going to be a good TribalCouncil tonight.
847,00:37:23.37,00:37:23.37,"- Hey, guys.- Hey, Jeff."
848,00:37:25.40,00:37:25.40,- It's been a busythree days.
849,00:37:28.20,00:37:28.20,- Yeah.
850,00:37:30.30,00:37:30.30,"- Ethan, what was yourreaction when these three new"
851,00:37:32.57,00:37:32.57,guys show up at your camp?
852,00:37:35.07,00:37:35.07,"- Well, our first reaction wasthey're coming to, you know,"
853,00:37:39.10,00:37:39.10,"steal our flag or, you know,steal something from our tribe."
854,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,"So we were very skeptical andparanoid, I guess could you say."
855,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,"But then we saw they had ourbuffs on, and they're like,"
856,00:37:50.50,00:37:50.50,"""Listen, we're part of you now."""
857,00:37:51.60,00:37:51.60,And it was absolute shock.
858,00:37:54.20,00:37:54.20,I didn't know what to think.
859,00:37:55.60,00:37:55.60,"You know, my stomach dropped,and I was just like..."
860,00:37:57.83,00:37:57.83,"""Oh, my God."""
861,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,"- The thing that was hard, itseemed because we had agonized"
862,00:38:03.23,00:38:03.23,"over who was going to go, whowas going to stay and we had all"
863,00:38:05.53,00:38:05.53,kinds of reasons why the peoplethat were going should go.
864,00:38:08.27,00:38:08.27,"And then when we actually sawwhat had happened, you still"
865,00:38:11.07,00:38:11.07,weren't sure if you had made theright decision to go or to stay.
866,00:38:14.17,00:38:14.17,"It was, like, you didn't know"
867,00:38:16.50,00:38:16.50,if it was a good thingor a bad thing.
868,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,"- Silas, spending threedays with this new tribe, do you"
869,00:38:20.53,00:38:20.53,"feel now that you guys are onetribe together, or are there"
870,00:38:22.70,00:38:22.70,still two tribal lines in there?
871,00:38:24.90,00:38:24.90,"- Well, Jeff, as soon as youswitched the buffs on us"
872,00:38:27.53,00:38:27.53,"and gave us the new colors,obviously it was a new game."
873,00:38:30.37,00:38:30.37,"So I think when we're allwearing yellow buffs,"
874,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,we're a team.
875,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"And I think that Samburu, thesame thing, they're wearing red"
876,00:38:39.90,00:38:39.90,and they're a team.
877,00:38:41.10,00:38:41.10,"- Frank, would you sayyour lot was improved or"
878,00:38:44.23,00:38:44.23,weakened by this swap?
879,00:38:47.40,00:38:47.40,"- Personally, improved, mostdefinitely."
880,00:38:50.20,00:38:50.20,Camp conditions-- excellent.
881,00:38:52.47,00:38:52.47,Good open line of communication.
882,00:38:54.80,00:38:54.80,"Very mature people--respect, a two-way street."
883,00:38:56.73,00:38:56.73,"Seem to have their prioritiesvery well set,"
884,00:38:58.60,00:38:58.60,their securities high.
885,00:39:00.40,00:39:00.40,I really like it.
886,00:39:02.30,00:39:02.30,"- Clarence, one of thenew things for you is another"
887,00:39:04.67,00:39:04.67,"young alpha male comingin here,"
888,00:39:06.93,00:39:06.93,does thatlessen the need for you?
889,00:39:09.43,00:39:09.43,"- No, actually, Silas coming inactually, you know, helps."
890,00:39:12.73,00:39:12.73,"I think that we're strongertogether, you know, and I think"
891,00:39:15.87,00:39:15.87,everyone here realizes thatwe're stronger together.
892,00:39:18.93,00:39:18.93,"Obviously,we saw that with the goats."
893,00:39:20.93,00:39:20.93,"You know, I picked up two goatsand it certainly helped,"
894,00:39:23.33,00:39:23.33,"you know, having my new tag teampartner, now that Tom's gone,"
895,00:39:26.53,00:39:26.53,having him pick up two goats.
896,00:39:28.03,00:39:28.03,"So, you know, having him here isdefinitely going to be"
897,00:39:30.70,00:39:30.70,"a benefit, more so thana hindrance, for me."
898,00:39:33.00,00:39:33.00,"- Okay, guys,time to vote."
899,00:39:34.53,00:39:34.53,"Silas, you're first."
900,00:40:24.33,00:40:24.33,"- I love you, man, but I can'ttrust you."
901,00:40:34.20,00:40:34.20,- I'll go tally the votes.
902,00:40:54.23,00:40:54.23,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
903,00:40:56.33,00:40:56.33,The person will be asked toleave the Tribal Council area
904,00:40:58.13,00:40:58.13,immediately.
905,00:40:59.37,00:40:59.37,I'll read the votes.
906,00:41:05.53,00:41:05.53,First vote...
907,00:41:08.03,00:41:08.03,Silas.
908,00:41:16.03,00:41:16.03,Silas.
909,00:41:27.10,00:41:27.10,Silas.
910,00:41:34.07,00:41:34.07,"The fourth and deciding vote,Silas."
911,00:41:38.03,00:41:38.03,No need to read the other two.
912,00:41:39.53,00:41:39.53,"You need to bring me yourtorch, Silas."
913,00:41:51.73,00:41:51.73,"Silas, the tribe has spoken."
914,00:41:57.20,00:41:57.20,It's time for you to go.
915,00:42:07.47,00:42:07.47,"Well, there's been a lot ofassumptions made by you guys"
916,00:42:10.30,00:42:10.30,so far in this game.
917,00:42:11.87,00:42:11.87,"One of them is that, in threedays, there'll be a merge."
918,00:42:19.10,00:42:19.10,You can head back to camp.I'll see you tomorrow.
919,00:42:42.13,00:42:42.13,Stay tuned for scenesfrom our next episode.

922,00:42:52.90,00:42:52.90,"- If there's no merger afterthree days, we have no food."
923,00:42:55.53,00:42:55.53,- (Jeff)At Samburu...
924,00:42:57.03,00:42:57.03,"- Strategy is becoming morecritical than ever,"
925,00:42:59.07,00:42:59.07,more than itwas even a couple days ago.
926,00:43:01.13,00:43:01.13,- (Jeff)Brandon and Kim continueto help Lindsey hide
927,00:43:03.30,00:43:03.30,her votesfrom their new tribe mates.
928,00:43:05.57,00:43:05.57,- They just assume that Ihave a vote.
929,00:43:07.13,00:43:07.13,- It's a wholedifferent ball game.
930,00:43:13.43,00:43:13.43,- The twist of the gamewas amazing.
931,00:43:15.07,00:43:15.07,I kind of had my cards lined upthe way I wanted them going into
932,00:43:18.73,00:43:18.73,"the merge, because I was withthe two people that were"
933,00:43:21.20,00:43:21.20,about to kick off.
934,00:43:22.53,00:43:22.53,"You know, I just couldn'trecover from it."
935,00:43:24.20,00:43:24.20,I was a threat to Ethanand the rest of the group.
936,00:43:26.80,00:43:26.80,It's tough to be sitting here.
937,00:43:28.17,00:43:28.17,"I, you know, I plannedon winning the whole thing."
938,00:43:30.13,00:43:30.13,I'd play the game tomorrow.I'd play it next year.
939,00:43:32.00,00:43:32.00,"I mean, it's unreal."
