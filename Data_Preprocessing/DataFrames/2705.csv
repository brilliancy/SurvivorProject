550,00:35:48.30,00:35:48.30,"I'M HERE AGAIN IN FRONT OF THIS FIRE, IN FRONT OF YOU."
551,00:35:50.63,00:35:50.63,IT'S VERY SURREAL TO ME. I CAME INTO THIS GAME THINKING I
552,00:35:53.27,00:35:53.27,"COULD PLAY IT A CERTAIN WAY, BUT THAT IS DEAD AND GONE."
553,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,THAT'S 13 YEARS AGO. THAT'S NOT NOW.
554,00:35:58.40,00:35:58.40,"THESE PEOPLE MAKE MOVES. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE WHEELING AND"
555,00:36:01.20,00:36:01.20,"DEALING FROM DAY ONE, LIKE, EITHER I NEED TO GET ON BOARD,"

557,00:36:07.70,00:36:07.70,THE WAY TO THE SECOND SEASON. WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE FROM YOUR
558,00:36:11.43,00:36:11.43,VANTAGE POINT AS ONE OF THE ORIGINATORS OF THIS GAME?
559,00:36:14.00,00:36:14.00,">> YOU KNOW, JEFF, I REMEMBER THINKING ON DAY 5 I HAD PLAYED"
560,00:36:17.57,00:36:17.57,MORE IN FIVE DAYS THAN I PLAYED MY ENTIRE SEASON IN AUSTRALIA.
561,00:36:22.10,00:36:22.10,"IT'S GOING THAT QUICKLY. AND THE ""BLOOD VERSUS WATER"""
562,00:36:26.47,00:36:26.47,"THING, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GAME JUST YOU, YOU CAN PLAY"
563,00:36:31.23,00:36:31.23,BALLS TO THE WALL. BUT IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

565,00:36:37.97,00:36:37.97,CHANGE THE GAME? >> THE STAKES ARE HIGHER.
566,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,"EVERY TIME GUTO A DUEL NOW FOR ME, I'M LOOKING OUT THERE FOR MY"
567,00:36:43.77,00:36:43.77,"LOVED ONE. AND THEN PEOPLE START THINKING,"
568,00:36:46.30,00:36:46.30,"WELL, WHO HAS MORE POWER WHEN THEY GET TO THE MERGE AND"
569,00:36:49.97,00:36:49.97,THEY'RE PERHAPS PLAYING WITH A LOVED ONE?
570,00:36:51.53,00:36:51.53,AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BECOME A TEAM OF TWO.
571,00:36:55.43,00:36:55.43,SO IT MAKES THE STRESS IN THE GAME TWOISES -- MUCH.
572,00:36:58.97,00:36:58.97,">> Jeff: OARAS, THAT LOYALTY OF WHETHER A LOVED ONE WILL VOTE"
573,00:37:01.70,00:37:01.70,THEIR LOVED ONE OUT OR NOT IS ONE OF THE BIG FACTORS.
574,00:37:04.50,00:37:04.50,">> IT'S A BIG FACTOR. YOU MAKE AN ALLIANCE, AND THEN"
575,00:37:07.83,00:37:07.83,YOU WONDER IN WHOIN MY ALLIANCE MIGHT GO WITH THEIR LOVED ONE.
576,00:37:10.77,00:37:10.77,YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.
577,00:37:13.03,00:37:13.03,"BUT RIGHT NOW, LET VYTAS DO WHAT VYTAS DOES AND MAYBE THERE'S"
578,00:37:17.67,00:37:17.67,SPACE FOR HIM OR MAYBE THERE'S NOT.
579,00:37:20.40,00:37:20.40,I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I SHORE UP ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIP.
580,00:37:23.53,00:37:23.53,>> Jeff: ARAS SAYS MY LOVED ONE IS ON HIS OWN.
581,00:37:26.67,00:37:26.67,IT'S THE ONLY THING YOU CAN SAY.
582,00:37:28.30,00:37:28.30,>> IT'S THE TRUTH. THERE'S A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO
583,00:37:30.37,00:37:30.37,"CUT THE APRON STRINGS AND SAY, SEAR AYOU HAVE TO FLY ON YOUR"
584,00:37:34.27,00:37:34.27,OWN. YOU CAN'T LIVE UNDER MY WING
585,00:37:37.23,00:37:37.23,ANYMORE. IT SOUNDS REALLY COLD AND HARD
586,00:37:38.77,00:37:38.77,BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS OUR BLOOD.
587,00:37:40.57,00:37:40.57,">> Jeff: AND, GERVASE, LAURA M. COULD MAKE A GOOD ARGUMENT"
588,00:37:43.73,00:37:43.73,SHE'S PROVEN SHE WILL SQUASH HER DAUGHTER AS SHE HAS REPEATEDLY
589,00:37:47.40,00:37:47.40,IN CHALLENGES. DOES THAT GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
590,00:37:49.60,00:37:49.60,"HER LOYALTY TO THIS TRIBE? >> HONESTLY, SPENDING TIME WITH"
591,00:37:52.47,00:37:52.47,"LAURA M., AND HEARING HER TALK ABOUT CIERA, THEY'RE CLOSE."
592,00:37:56.13,00:37:56.13,"AND THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR, BUT IT'S ALSO THREATENING."
593,00:37:59.37,00:37:59.37,"UN, IT'S FOR EVERYBODY HERE-- MOTHER-DAUGHTER, BROTHERS,"
594,00:38:03.70,00:38:03.70,"BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND, OR HUSBAND AND WIVES."
595,00:38:05.53,00:38:05.53,IT DOESN'T GET TIGHTER THAN THAT.
596,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,">> Jeff: LAURA B., YOU WERE VOTED OUT SECONDS INTO THE"

602,00:38:23.47,00:38:23.47,"I AM A BIG PART OF THIS TRIBE, AND I THINK I'VE SHOWN THAT."
603,00:38:26.17,00:38:26.17,"SO I DO BELONG HERE. OF COURSE, I BELONG HERE."
604,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,>> Jeff: MONICA WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
605,00:38:35.83,00:38:35.83,>> ABSOLUTELY. SHE WAS WITH US DAY ONE.
606,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,SHE IS A PART OF WHAT IS HAPPENING.
607,00:38:39.90,00:38:39.90,SHE FISHES. SHE DOES FIRE.
608,00:38:41.63,00:38:41.63,SHE DEFINITELY HAS A PLACE IN THIS TRIBE.

610,00:38:47.80,00:38:47.80,BEFORE THEY VOTE THEM OUT-- GREATEST TRIBE MEMBER EVER.
611,00:38:50.30,00:38:50.30,>> THERE IS ALWAYS THE BACKSIDE I COULD BE AN EASY VOTE.
612,00:38:53.33,00:38:53.33,I WAS WELCOMED WITH OPEN ARMS BUT I DID SEE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
613,00:38:57.13,00:38:57.13,"IN MY TRIBE'S EYES. >> Jeff: DO YOU GET THAT,"
614,00:39:01.20,00:39:01.20,"LAURA B., EVEN THOUGH YOU WANT TO PLAY, YOU'RE NOT RUPERT."
615,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40,"RUPERT IS TIE DYE, MAN IN THE WOODS."
616,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,>> BUT THE CONFIDENCE IN ME THINKS I'M SUCH A HUGE PART OF
617,00:39:12.40,00:39:12.40,"THIS TRIBE, AND I'VE BONDED WITH THESE PEOPLE I FEEL LIKE."
