247,00:15:06.70,00:15:06.70,IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO LIVE WITH YOU KNOW.
248,00:15:10.07,00:15:10.07,I WATCHED SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN FRONT OF ME.
249,00:15:13.07,00:15:13.07,"I SEEN MY FRIENDS IN BODY BAGS, AND I'VE JUST BEEN IN A LOT OF"

419,00:27:17.07,00:27:17.07,"OF THE THREE THAT ARE ON THE OUTS RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO KEEP"
420,00:27:20.97,00:27:20.97,REYNOLD AND EDDIE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE TO WIN SOME OF THESE
421,00:27:23.77,00:27:23.77,CHALANGES THAT'S WHY TONIGHT IT SHOULD BE HOPE.

447,00:28:51.90,00:28:51.90,>> YEAH-- >> IT'S NOT THE BEST FEELING.
448,00:28:56.27,00:28:56.27,I'M JUST TRYING TO ENJOY MY LAST LITTLE MOMENT.
449,00:28:59.43,00:28:59.43,"YOU KNOW, I'M CONCERNED I'M ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT."
450,00:29:03.57,00:29:03.57,REYNOLD IS SAFE BECAUSE HE HAS THE IDOL.
451,00:29:05.63,00:29:05.63,I CAN'T SEE HIM GIVING UP HIS IDOL BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A RISKY
452,00:29:09.03,00:29:09.03,"MOVE. >> IF IT I WAS UP TO ME, IT"
453,00:29:12.43,00:29:12.43,"WOULD BE DIFFERENT, I WOULD TAKE HIM OUT."
454,00:29:14.27,00:29:14.27,"BUT HE HAS THAT NECKLACE. TRUST ME, I WOULD MUCH RATHER"

456,00:29:22.23,00:29:22.23,"I'LL BE HONEST, I'M NOT VOTING FOR YOU TONIGHT."
457,00:29:24.87,00:29:24.87,">> WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT. I FEEL LIKE IT'S OUT OF MY"

466,00:29:57.27,00:29:57.27,TO GIVE HER A HINT ON WHAT WOULD SAVE HER FATE.
467,00:30:00.63,00:30:00.63,AFTER YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M
468,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,SAYING. WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE

470,00:30:07.63,00:30:07.63,"LIKE, ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS VOTE UNDER EDDIE TO SAVE HERSELF."
471,00:30:11.07,00:30:11.07,BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S REALLY GOING TO TAKE HEED.
472,00:30:15.00,00:30:15.00,>> I TALKED TO SHAMAR. >> UH-HUH.
473,00:30:18.53,00:30:18.53,>> AND HE JUST MADE IT SOUND LIKE IT WAS FOR SURE THE GROUP
474,00:30:22.13,00:30:22.13,HAD DECIDE IT WAS ME OR EDDIE GOING HOME.
475,00:30:25.30,00:30:25.30,>> SHAMAR TOLD HOPE THE PLAN THAT WE'RE DOING.

480,00:30:38.33,00:30:38.33,>> AND COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE BLURBED WHAT OUR PLAN WAS
481,00:30:41.00,00:30:41.00,BECAUSE I THINK HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE GAME.
482,00:30:43.60,00:30:43.60,SHAMAR JUST TOLD HOPE THAT-- OUR PLAN.
483,00:30:48.20,00:30:48.20,YUP. >> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT BUT I CAN
484,00:30:50.73,00:30:50.73,BELIEVE IT THAT SHAMAR JUST OPENED HIS MOUTH.
485,00:30:53.23,00:30:53.23,>> IF HE JUST TOLD HOPE THE PLAN HE'S NOT PLANNING ON VOTING WITH
486,00:30:57.87,00:30:57.87,"US, IS HE. SHAMAR AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE"
487,00:31:01.63,00:31:01.63,IS A COMPLETE WILD CARD. >> ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SHAMAR
