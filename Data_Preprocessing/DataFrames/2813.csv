553,00:32:23.77,00:32:23.77,HE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE FINAL TWO THIS SEASON.

597,00:35:08.23,00:35:08.23,BROKEN AT THIS STAGE BY A FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.
598,00:35:13.83,00:35:13.83,DOES TONY WANT TO FORCE THAT? SPENCER WOULD PROBABLY LOVE TO

628,00:37:17.60,00:37:17.60,IT SOFTENED ME UP. AND MY SISTER SAID IT BEST TODAY
629,00:37:21.23,00:37:21.23,AT THE CHALLENGE EYE AM NEUROTIC.
630,00:37:23.60,00:37:23.60,AND THIS WILL BITE IF I LEAVE THE GAME TWO DAYS SHORT OF MY

685,00:41:03.50,00:41:03.50,THAT'S THE SPECIAL POWERS THAT THIS IDOL HAS.
686,00:41:06.27,00:41:06.27,HOWEVER IT CAN ONLY BE PLAYED WITH FIVE REMAINING PLAYERS
687,00:41:09.53,00:41:09.53,LEFT. THAT'S THE LAST TIME I CAN PLAY
688,00:41:11.07,00:41:11.07,"IT. TODAY THERE ARE ONLY FOUR, SO"
689,00:41:12.83,00:41:12.83,THIS IDOL IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS TONIGHT.
690,00:41:14.97,00:41:14.97,SO THE WAY I USED IT TONIGHT IS BY WEARING IT AROUND MY NECK.
691,00:41:18.07,00:41:18.07,"IF MY NAME APPEARS THREE TIMES, I'M GOING HOME TONIGHT."
692,00:41:21.37,00:41:21.37,I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE. >> Jeff: OKAY.

713,00:43:25.50,00:43:25.50,LOT OF DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE BECAUSE SPENCER WAS
714,00:43:29.00,00:43:29.00,ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR PLAISHZ THIS SEASON.
715,00:43:31.50,00:43:31.50,YOU SAW HIM WALKING OUT OF TRIBAL.
716,00:43:34.50,00:43:34.50,AND I GET THIS QUESTION A LOT-- THEY'RE WALKING.
717,00:43:36.53,00:43:36.53,"WHERE ARE THEY GO? ALL RIGHT, HERE'S LITERALLY WHAT"

984,01:00:45.33,01:00:45.33,"THAT'S HOW THE GAME GOES, WOO. MY ARGUMENT TO WOO IS A PRETTY"
985,01:00:49.57,01:00:49.57,VALID ARGUMENT. WOO HAS BASED HIS GAME AROUND

987,01:00:56.13,01:00:56.13,FOR TO YOU OUST ME NOW. YOU JUST THREW YOUR GAME PLAN

994,01:01:12.87,01:01:12.87,I WOULDN'T BUY IT. I'D TAKE MY CHANCES WITH KASS.
995,01:01:18.73,01:01:18.73,>> REMEMBER WHAT TONY'S BEEN TELLING YOU THIS WHOLE TIME IS
996,01:01:21.63,01:01:21.63,"TAKE KASS, TAKE KASS, BECAUSE WE CAN BEAT HER."
997,01:01:24.27,01:01:24.27,RIGHT? >> I HEAR THAT.
998,01:01:25.77,01:01:25.77,>> WHY WOULD HIS REASONING CHANGE RIGHT NOW.
999,01:01:27.80,01:01:27.80,>> UH-HUH. >> HE CARRIED ME ALL THIS WAY
1000,01:01:31.57,01:01:31.57,"BECAUSE HE KNEW I'M UNLIKABLE. TO ME, YOU ARE LIKE FABIO RIGHT"
1001,01:01:36.27,01:01:36.27,NOW. YOU HAVEN'T REALLY HURT ANYBODY.
1002,01:01:39.30,01:01:39.30,NOBODY REALLY KNOWS YOU. EVERYBODY HATES ME.
1003,01:01:41.77,01:01:41.77,"BUT IF GUWITH TONY, TONY'S GOING TO SAY, ""I PULLED HIM ALONG."
1004,01:01:46.07,01:01:46.07,"WE HURT THE SAME PEOPLE, BUT I MADE THE MOVES."
1005,01:01:50.00,01:01:50.00,"WHY SHOULD HE GET THE MONEY WHEN I DID ALL THE WORK."""
1006,01:01:52.93,01:01:52.93,THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY IF I WAS TONY.
1007,01:01:56.60,01:01:56.60,"IF I'M ON THERE, I'M VOTING FOR TONY."
1008,01:01:59.27,01:01:59.27,"BECAUSE HE PLAYED THE BEST GAME. WOO IS LIKE A CUTE SURFER DUDE,"
1009,01:02:06.60,01:02:06.60,"AWESOME, COOL. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?"
1010,01:02:08.30,01:02:08.30,HOW DO I SPELL THEIR NAME? THIS IS SO INSANE RIGHT NOW.
1011,01:02:12.57,01:02:12.57,BUT I HEAR YOU 100%. >> YEAH.
1012,01:02:15.40,01:02:15.40,IT'S HORRIFYING. THE PERSON WHO HASN'T MADE A
1013,01:02:17.47,01:02:17.47,DECISION THE WHOLE GAME IS IN CHARGE OF MY FATE.
1014,01:02:21.67,01:02:21.67,>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD TONY.
1015,01:02:24.27,01:02:24.27,I'M GOING TO TAKE A DAY TO THINK ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS OF BOTH
1016,01:02:30.97,01:02:30.97,"ARGUMENTS, AND I'LL JUST MAKE MY DECISIONA TRIBAL COUNCIL"
1017,01:02:34.20,01:02:34.20,TONIGHT. >> I RESPECT THAT.
1018,01:02:35.57,01:02:35.57,"I WANT WOO TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM, WHICH IS TO TAKE ME."
1019,01:02:40.30,01:02:40.30,"IF HE UNDERSTANDS HOW PEOPLE THINK, TAKING ME IS HIS BETTER"
1020,01:02:45.07,01:02:45.07,OPTION. REALLY.
1021,01:02:53.70,01:02:53.70,>> I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SITTING AT THE END WITH TONY.
1022,01:02:57.00,01:02:57.00,THIS IS THE GUY I STARTED WITH. THIS IS THE GUY I COMMITTED
1023,01:03:01.97,01:03:01.97,"MYSELF WITH. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, LIKE,"
1024,01:03:04.90,01:03:04.90,TAKING TONY MEANS MY CHANCES OF WINNING ARE NOT SO GREAT.
1025,01:03:11.90,01:03:11.90,"OH, BRO. IF I TAKE SOMEONE LIKE KASS, YOU"
1026,01:03:15.20,01:03:15.20,"KNOW, AND I BREAK MY LOYALTY WITH TONY, IT COMPLETELY"
1027,01:03:19.97,01:03:19.97,CONTRADICTS WHO I AM. AND I BECOME THE BIGGEST
1028,01:03:25.07,01:03:25.07,HYPOCRITE. SO IT'S TOUGH.
1029,01:03:26.63,01:03:26.63,I WANT TO BE A SOLE SURVIVOR. AND TO HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS.

1058,01:05:33.90,01:05:33.90,TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE THE NIGHT.
1059,01:05:35.40,01:05:35.40,I WAS LOYAL TO WOO. I KNOW WOO'S GAME PLAY WAS
