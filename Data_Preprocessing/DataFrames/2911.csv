365,00:21:12.70,00:21:12.70,NOT GOING TO HURT ANYBODY. IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE CREAM
366,00:21:15.97,00:21:15.97,"CHEESE-- YOU KNOW, CREAM CHEESE YOU CAN'T HURT MANY THINGS WITH"
367,00:21:19.50,00:21:19.50,PUTTING CREAM CHEESE ON IT. YOU KNOW I WANTED TO PLAY WITH
368,00:21:22.40,00:21:22.40,YOU AND IT SEEMED LIKE YOU DIDN'T AT ALL GIVE ME THE TIME
369,00:21:25.07,00:21:25.07,"OF DAY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. >> LOOKING AT ALEC AND JACLYN,"
370,00:21:28.07,00:21:28.07,I'M THINKING WHY IS JACLYN FLIRTING WITH HIM?
371,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,"JON'S BEEN GONE TWO DAYS, AND ALEC AND HER BODY LANGUAGE IS"
372,00:21:33.77,00:21:33.77,"JUST REALLY INAPPROPRIATE. IF IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND HERE, I"
373,00:21:37.13,00:21:37.13,WOULDN'T BE ACTING LIKE THAT WITH ALEC.
374,00:21:47.27,00:21:47.27,>> I NEED TO GET FAT. >> I WANT TO HAVE A COMPETITION

377,00:22:05.07,00:22:05.07,SUSPICIOUS THAT JACLYN IS WORKING WITH ALEC MORE CLOSELY
378,00:22:07.83,00:22:07.83,THAN I THOUGHT. >> MY CONCERN IS DEFINITELY THAT
379,00:22:16.47,00:22:16.47,"JACLYN WILL BE SUEDE BY ALAND HE CAN THE OTHER GUYS, AND IF SHE'S"
380,00:22:20.40,00:22:20.40,"SWAYED, THEN JON IS SWAYED, BECAUSE JACLYN AND JON DO"
381,00:22:23.67,00:22:23.67,EVERYTHING TOGETHER. SO JACLYN AND ALEC FLIRTING AND
382,00:22:26.07,00:22:26.07,TALKING ABOUT THE GAME IS JUST NOT OKAY.

412,00:24:40.43,00:24:40.43,THAT WAS FAST. REED LANDS ONE RIGHT IN THE
413,00:24:45.60,00:24:45.60,CENTER. THAT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO WORK

545,00:32:24.73,00:32:24.73,CONSIDERING IT A LITTLE MORE THAN HE WANTS TO LET ON.
546,00:32:26.63,00:32:26.63,>> ALL RIGHT. >> I HONESTLY DON'T CARE IF YOU
547,00:32:28.83,00:32:28.83,"GUYS WANT TO TALK. >> NO, WE'RE GOOD."
548,00:32:31.03,00:32:31.03,>> IT'S COOL. >> I THINK JACLYN GOT A LITTLE
549,00:32:33.57,00:32:33.57,CONFUSED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SHE NECESSARILY SAW THE WINK
550,00:32:35.63,00:32:35.63,HAPPEN AND SHE WAS STILL STIEWG ABOUT I THINK BEING BLOWN UP AT
551,00:32:38.87,00:32:38.87,"BY JON, WHICH I'M KIND OF LIKE, AH, THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS."
552,00:32:45.37,00:32:45.37,>> I TALKED TO JON AND JACLYN. AND THEY ACTUALLY MIGHT BE
553,00:32:49.60,00:32:49.60,"WILLING TO WORK WITH US. IF WE STAY STRONG, WE MAY HAVE A"
554,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,SHOT AT I THIS. >> I'M PRETTY SURE JON IS
555,00:32:58.50,00:32:58.50,STANDING THERE SCRAMBLING WITH MISSY.
556,00:33:00.20,00:33:00.20,>> I DID FIND THE IDOL. ( LAUGHING )

558,00:33:06.80,00:33:06.80,>> YUP. I FOUND IT.
559,00:33:08.20,00:33:08.20,">> OH, MY GOD! >> I LITERALLY HAVE THE WORST"
560,00:33:13.37,00:33:13.37,HEADACHE RIGHT NOW. TELL ME WHOSE NAME TO WRITE
561,00:33:15.80,00:33:15.80,DOWN. I DON'T CARE.
562,00:33:16.77,00:33:16.77,"AFTER OUR ARGUMENT, THE ONLY PERSON I WOULD EXPECT JON TO"
563,00:33:19.53,00:33:19.53,TALK TO WOULD BE MISSY BECAUSE HE LOOKS TO HIS MOM FOR ADVICE
564,00:33:23.23,00:33:23.23,"IN REAL LIFE, AND I THINK THAT MISSY HAS TAKEN ON THAT ROLE ON"
565,00:33:26.27,00:33:26.27,THE ISLAND. AND IT MADE ME MAD MAHE TALKED
566,00:33:28.67,00:33:28.67,"TO HER FOR, LIKE, A HALF HOUR, AND DIDN'T COME TALK TO ME AT"
567,00:33:31.80,00:33:31.80,ALL. THAT MADE ME EVEN MORE MAD.
568,00:33:33.70,00:33:33.70,"LIKE, YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING WITH MISSY."
569,00:33:36.27,00:33:36.27,YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH ME. >> HE JUST FREAKED OUT WHEN I
570,00:33:38.63,00:33:38.63,TRIED TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TWO DAYS.
571,00:33:41.70,00:33:41.70,>> FREAKED OUT LIKE WHAT. >> FREAKED OUT ON ME.
572,00:33:44.23,00:33:44.23,SCREW HIM. HE DOESN'T NEED ME.
573,00:33:45.87,00:33:45.87,"I DON'T NEED TO BE HERE. >> NO, HE DOES NEED YOU."
574,00:33:48.60,00:33:48.60,MY FEARS ARE THAT JON AND JACLYN ARE NOT AS ATTACHED AT THE HIP
575,00:33:52.60,00:33:52.60,AS THEY SEEMED TO BE WHICH THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF FRICTION WHEN
576,00:33:55.53,00:33:55.53,IT COMES TO HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.
577,00:33:58.13,00:33:58.13,">> OH, GOD. I'M EVEN MORE ANNOYED RIGHT NOW."
578,00:34:00.70,00:34:00.70,">> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I WANT JON AND JACLYN FINE FOR TONIGHT."
579,00:34:03.60,00:34:03.60,I CAN'T DO ANY MORE SURPRISES AT TRIBAL.
580,00:34:06.37,00:34:06.37,>> HI. >> I'M SORRY.

586,00:34:30.33,00:34:30.33,PAGE AS I AM. AND SHE REFUSES TO TALK TO ME.
587,00:34:33.80,00:34:33.80,NOT A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT. >> I FEEL REALLY BAD NOW.
588,00:34:42.80,00:34:42.80,"I DIDN'T MEAN TO-- I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS, LIKE, EXPLODING ON"
589,00:34:46.60,00:34:46.60,HER. >> JUST NOW?

594,00:35:25.13,00:35:25.13,>> I'M NOT READY TO TALK YET. >> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TALK NOW?
595,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,>> I'M NOT READY TO TALK YET. >> NO!
596,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,STOP! >> I'M GETTING THE SILENT
597,00:35:40.50,00:35:40.50,"TREATMENT RIGHT NOW FROM JACLYN, AND IT'S THE MOST FRUSTRATING"
598,00:35:44.27,00:35:44.27,THING THAT SHE DOES. THERE'S NO POINT.
599,00:35:46.93,00:35:46.93,TALK IT OUT. LET'S TALK.
600,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,>> NINE DAYS LEFT. >> THAT CAN BE MY ONLY CHANCE TO

602,00:36:01.50,00:36:01.50,ALEC. SO WHAT DO WE DO?
603,00:36:02.97,00:36:02.97,VOTE FOR REED OR VOTE FOR MISSY. >> YOU KNOW HOW DISRESPECTED YOU
604,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,"MADE ME FEEL TODAY. LIKE, WHY DID YOU YELL AT ME"
605,00:36:11.67,00:36:11.67,LIKE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING--

607,00:36:16.33,00:36:16.33,EXILE. I MISSED YOU.
608,00:36:17.60,00:36:17.60,"LIKE, ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND RELAX FOR A"
609,00:36:20.60,00:36:20.60,"MINUTE. OKAY, YOU KNOW, WHAT?"

611,00:36:25.63,00:36:25.63,"ME, GO BACK BY THE FIRE. IT'S FINE."
612,00:36:27.57,00:36:27.57,>> I'M LISTENING. >> YOU'RE ROLLING YOUR EYES.
613,00:36:30.83,00:36:30.83,>> YOU'RE BEING A ( BLEEP ) NOW. >> I'M PISSED.
614,00:36:33.43,00:36:33.43,>> GOOD! >> MY WHOLE PLAN HINGES ON JON
615,00:36:38.17,00:36:38.17,"AND JACLYN, AND SHE'S FURIOUS. SHE'S STOMPING AROUND CAMP AND"
616,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,NOT TALKING TO HIM. MY LIFE HINGES ON THOSE TWO
617,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND FIGURING OUT WHO THEY WANT TO GO
618,00:36:48.63,00:36:48.63,WITH THIS ALLIANCE OR THAT ALLIANCE.
619,00:36:50.80,00:36:50.80,>>ALLIANCE. >> THEN THAT SUCKS FOR YOU.

905,00:56:34.30,00:56:34.30,"NATALIE, THE MORE REASSURED I AM OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR ALLIANCE."
906,00:56:43.27,00:56:43.27,">> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, CHEERS TO DAY 30, AND THEN WE CAN START."
907,00:56:46.77,00:56:46.77,>> CHEERS. >> REWARD AT THIS POINT IN THE
908,00:56:50.10,00:56:50.10,GAME IS WAY MORE THAN JUST GETTING TO SLEEP IN A BED AND
909,00:56:53.30,00:56:53.30,"ENJOYING PASTA AND CHICKEN PARM. >> OH, MY GOD."
910,00:56:56.90,00:56:56.90,THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT FOR 30 DAYS.
911,00:57:00.40,00:57:00.40,>> EVERYBODY IS SO COMFORTABLE NOW.
912,00:57:02.13,00:57:02.13,THEY PROBABLY WANT TO GET RID OF KEITH BECAUSE KEITH'S CONNECTION
913,00:57:06.47,00:57:06.47,WITH THE JURY IS SCARY. BUT I WANT TO BLINDED SIDE JON.
914,00:57:10.47,00:57:10.47,I'M GETTING BACK AT JON FOR JEREMY.
915,00:57:14.43,00:57:14.43,I DON'T TRUST JON IN THE LONG RUN.
916,00:57:16.30,00:57:16.30,I WANT TO MOVEED FOR WITH A NEW PLAN WITHOUT JON IN IT YOU CAN
917,00:57:20.93,00:57:20.93,HAVE MY WINE. >> THANKS!
918,00:57:23.40,00:57:23.40,">> CALL ME A WINE SNOB, BUT I LIKE WINE BECAUSE IT'S A MEMORY"
919,00:57:28.90,00:57:28.90,OF MY DAD TEACH MEEG HOW TO DRINK WINE PROPERLY.
920,00:57:32.20,00:57:32.20,THERE WERE SO MANY LAYERS OF COMPLEXITY TO WINE.
921,00:57:34.53,00:57:34.53,"THAT THE FURTHER YOU GET INTO IT, THE MORE YOU REALIZE OH, MY"
922,00:57:37.50,00:57:37.50,GOSH. I HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED THE
923,00:57:38.80,00:57:38.80,SURFACE OF IT. AND IT'S SUCH A CONVERSATION
924,00:57:43.23,00:57:43.23,PIECE. I WANT TO GET MY REP PORUP FOR
925,00:57:46.83,00:57:46.83,BEING A SOMELLIER. I WILL PROBABLY END UP WORKING
926,00:57:50.17,00:57:50.17,IN ONE OF THE NICE ESTRESTAURANTS IN LAS VEGAS.
927,00:57:52.50,00:57:52.50,"IT WILL BE, LIKE, A YEAR IN LAS VEGAS AND THEN WE FINISH LIVING"
928,00:57:55.90,00:57:55.90,"A YEAR IN ITALY. >> OH, MY GOD, AMAZING."
929,00:57:59.30,00:57:59.30,JON IS ALWAYS BRINGING UP ANY EXCUSE TO TALK ABOUT WINE AND
930,00:58:02.30,00:58:02.30,"HOW HE WANTS TO-- I DON'T KNOW, BE SOME KIND OF WINE SPECIALIST"
931,00:58:07.23,00:58:07.23,"IN THE FUTURE AND MOVE TO VEGAS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT, BUT HE IS"
932,00:58:11.73,00:58:11.73,ALWAYS TRYING TO PRETEND HE KNOWS EVERYTHING AND THE
933,00:58:14.33,00:58:14.33,ARROGANCE OR ENTITLEMENT JON HAS.
934,00:58:16.37,00:58:16.37,"HONESTLY, EVERY TIME HE TALKS ABOUT WINE I JUST WANT TO BE"
935,00:58:18.73,00:58:18.73,"LIKE SHUT UP. IT WAS TORTURE, BASICALLY."
936,00:58:21.80,00:58:21.80,ARE WE GOING TO TALK STRATEGY AT ALL.
937,00:58:23.70,00:58:23.70,>> WHAT STRATEGY DO WE NEED TO TALK?
938,00:58:25.50,00:58:25.50,>> I DON'T KNOW. >> I JUST FEEL LIKE I CAN TRUST
939,00:58:27.80,00:58:27.80,100% THAT THE PLAN IS WHAT WE SAY IT IS BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE
940,00:58:31.77,00:58:31.77,WE CAN TRUST YOU VERY WELL. HOW ABOUT THIS.
941,00:58:37.73,00:58:37.73,"BECAUSE OF HOW COMFORTABLE WE ARE WITH YOU, I DID FIND THE"
942,00:58:41.70,00:58:41.70,IDOL. >> THAT'S CRAZY.
943,00:58:43.30,00:58:43.30,>> THAT'S SO CRAZY. >> YOU'VE HAD SO MUCH LUCK ON
944,00:58:46.53,00:58:46.53,EXILE. JON SHOULD NOT TRUST ME BUT I'M
945,00:58:49.33,00:58:49.33,HAPPY THAT HE DOES. THE FACT THAT HE TOLD ME THAT HE
946,00:58:52.27,00:58:52.27,FOUND AN IDOL ON EXILE IS AMAZING BECAUSE I'VE BECOME LIKE
947,00:58:55.93,00:58:55.93,THE BEST FRIEND NOW FOR HIM. GETTING JON OUT NOW IS REALLY
948,00:58:59.40,00:58:59.40,IMPORTANT. I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO
949,00:59:00.80,00:59:00.80,"DO ALL THIS, AND IF I COULD FULL OFF, THAT WOULD BE AMAZING."
950,00:59:23.10,00:59:23.10,">> YOU WERE MOVING A LOT. >> I KNOW, SORRY."
951,00:59:26.43,00:59:26.43,I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE. IT FREAKED ME OUT.
952,00:59:36.67,00:59:36.67,I WAS JUST LISTENING TO HIM TALK AND TALK AND TALK.
953,00:59:39.13,00:59:39.13,HE FEELS SO COMFORTABLE AFTER LAST NIGHT.
954,00:59:42.60,00:59:42.60,HE'S ALREADY BANKING ON WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO WITH THE
955,00:59:44.57,00:59:44.57,MILLION DOLLARS. HE'S LIKE I CAN'T WAIT TO DO
956,00:59:46.60,00:59:46.60,THIS AND THIS AND THIS. >> IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY.
957,00:59:48.57,00:59:48.57,>> EVERYTHING. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GAME FOR
958,00:59:50.77,00:59:50.77,THEM. IT'S JUST ABOUT THEM AND THEIR
959,00:59:52.57,00:59:52.57,PERFECT LIFE THEY WANT AS A COUPLE.
960,00:59:53.90,00:59:53.90,JON IS VERY CONFIDENT. HE THINKS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE
961,00:59:57.23,00:59:57.23,A REALLY EASY CAKEWALK TO THE FINAL THREE BECAUSE HE HAS MISSY
962,01:00:00.90,01:00:00.90,AROUND HIS FINGER. HE THINKS BAYLOR IS NOT GOING TO
963,01:00:03.53,01:00:03.53,DO ANYTHING TO MESS UP HIS MOM'S PLAN.
964,01:00:05.83,01:00:05.83,HE HAS HIS GIRLFRIEND WRAPPED AROUND HIS FINGER AND HE THINKS
965,01:00:09.00,01:00:09.00,I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.
966,01:00:12.30,01:00:12.30,>> HE'S SUCH A PUNK. >> I JUST WANT HIM OUT.
967,01:00:14.70,01:00:14.70,">> YEAH. EVEN THOUGH HE'S OBNOXIOUS,"
968,01:00:17.37,01:00:17.37,JON'S PLAYED A REALLY GOOD GAME. THE MORE AND MORE I'M THINKING
969,01:00:19.87,01:00:19.87,"OF THE JURY, WHY RISK EVEN GOING TO FINAL THREE WITH SOMEBODY"
970,01:00:22.83,01:00:22.83,"LIKE JON. IF HE WINS, I WILL LITERALLY"
971,01:00:24.97,01:00:24.97,KILL MYSELF. I SAY WE VOTE OUT JON.
972,01:00:27.67,01:00:27.67,BUT DON'T TELL MISSY BECAUSE THESE NOT GOING TO VOTE JON OFF.
973,01:00:31.60,01:00:31.60,YOUR MOM IS KIND OF BLINDED BY JON.
974,01:00:33.40,01:00:33.40,">> NOT ONLY THAT, MY NOM IS BLINDED BY TRYING TO HELP HIM."
975,01:00:40.30,01:00:40.30,">> ME AND NATALIE ARE KIND OF ""SURVIVOR"""" SISTER AT THIS POINT"
976,01:00:45.87,01:00:45.87,"AND DECIDED TO GET RID OF JON. UNFORTUNATELY, MY MOM, MY"
977,01:00:49.53,01:00:49.53,"CLOSEST ALLIANCE HERE, IS ALIGNED WITH HIM."
978,01:00:50.93,01:00:50.93,>> HOW WAS IT? SO GOOD?
979,01:00:52.73,01:00:52.73,">> IT WAS GOOD. IT'S WEIRD, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE"
980,01:00:55.17,01:00:55.17,"WE'RE, LIKE SITTING OVER THERE AND THE WHOLE TIME WE'RE LIKE,"
981,01:00:58.80,01:00:58.80,"THIS SUCTION, WE CAN'T JUST SHARE THIS WITH EVERYBODY."
982,01:01:02.50,01:01:02.50,>> JON JUST REMIND ME TOO MUCH OF PAST MEN IN MY MOM'S LIFE
983,01:01:07.80,01:01:07.80,"WHERE SHE GETS BLINDS SIDED, HEARTBROKEN AND HURT AND I DON'T"
984,01:01:11.23,01:01:11.23,WANT HIM TO SCREW HER OVER. IT DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL BAD
985,01:01:15.30,01:01:15.30,"VOTING HIM OUT. >> ME, YOU, KEITH, AND ALEC."
986,01:01:18.80,01:01:18.80,I KNOW THEY WILL VOTE HIM BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE JON.
987,01:01:21.30,01:01:21.30,JUST HOPEFULLY HE DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY.
988,01:01:43.10,01:01:43.10,>> THEY SLEEP ALL NIGHT AND THEY SLEEP ALL DAY.
989,01:01:49.83,01:01:49.83,"I'M BEHIND THE 8 BALL RIGHT NOW, AND IT PISSES ME OFF THAT JON'S"
990,01:01:54.63,01:01:54.63,JUST COASTING. I DON'T HAVE NO STROKE OUT HERE.
991,01:01:57.50,01:01:57.50,I'M NOT THE CAPTAIN OUT THERE. THAT FIVE-SOME THEY'VE GOT IS
992,01:02:03.80,01:02:03.80,TIGHT. I'M ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN.
993,01:02:05.23,01:02:05.23,I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BOLT BEFORE LONG AND HOPEFULLY
994,01:02:09.03,01:02:09.03,"THEY'LL BOLT MY WAY. >> TODAY, I GOT A VERY WEIRD"
995,01:02:32.17,01:02:32.17,VIBE FROM CAMP. AND IT WORRIED ME BECAUSE WE'RE
996,01:02:34.60,01:02:34.60,SO CLOSE TO THE END. A WEIRD VIBE CAN MEAN VERY BAD
997,01:02:40.47,01:02:40.47,THINGS. >> I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S GOING
998,01:02:43.60,01:02:43.60,ON BACK THERE. DO YOU REALLY TRUST NATALIE?
999,01:02:47.23,01:02:47.23,>> YEAH. >> MAYBE I'M JUST BEING
1000,01:02:51.50,01:02:51.50,PARANOID. I DON'T KNOW.
1001,01:02:53.70,01:02:53.70,"I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY OUT HERE, HONESTLY."
1002,01:02:56.33,01:02:56.33,BUT IF-- BUT YOU HAVE A CONNECTION WITH THEM.
1003,01:02:58.77,01:02:58.77,I DON'T. >> I'M WORRIED THAT KEITH IS
1004,01:03:03.80,01:03:03.80,"TRYING TO SWAY MISSY, BAYLOR, AND NATALIE TO PROBABLY VOTE OUT"
1005,01:03:07.60,01:03:07.60,JON. IT JUST MAKES ME SO NERVOUS THAT
1006,01:03:10.17,01:03:10.17,"JON THINKS HE GOT IT IN THE BAG, AND THAT'S HOW WE ARE IN REAL"
1007,01:03:14.27,01:03:14.27,"LIFE, TOO. LIKE, HE GETS SUPER AMPED UP FOR"
1008,01:03:17.93,01:03:17.93,"STUFF AND REALLY POSITIVE AND, ""I GOT IT."""
1009,01:03:20.37,01:03:20.37,AND THEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND HE'S SUPER DISAPPOINTED.
1010,01:03:22.80,01:03:22.80,"AND I'M WORRIED IF HE'S NOT CAREFUL, THAT COULD HAPPEN TO"
1011,01:03:25.27,01:03:25.27,"HIM AGAIN. >> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS."
1012,01:03:53.87,01:03:53.87,"WE'LL NOW BRING IN ALEC, RETURNING FROM EXILE ISLAND."
1013,01:03:56.40,01:03:56.40,>> YAY! ( APPLAUSE )
1014,01:04:01.20,01:04:01.20,">> ALEC! >> HI, GUYS."

1018,01:04:17.63,01:04:17.63,LOVED ONES THAT ARE FATIGUED REALLY CAN AFFECT YOUR OWN GAME.
1019,01:04:21.63,01:04:21.63,">> Jeff: MISSY, WHAT'S GOING ON."
1020,01:04:24.67,01:04:24.67,YOU'RE HOLDING BACK THE TEARS. >> I'M FINE.

1022,01:04:30.93,01:04:30.93,CAN YOU PINPOINT IT? >> IT'S-- IT'S JUST PHYSICAL.
1023,01:04:34.50,01:04:34.50,"IT IS-- I MEAN, I'M SO DEPLETED. IT'S NOT EVEN FOOD FOR ME."
1024,01:04:39.20,01:04:39.20,"IT'S SLEEP. >> Jeff: BAYLOR, WHAT'S IT"
1025,01:04:42.23,01:04:42.23,"LIKE TO SEE YOUR MOM, WHO FOR MOST OF YOUR LIFE HAS PROBABLY"
1026,01:04:45.50,01:04:45.50,"BEEN THE SOURCE OF STRENGTH, AND NOW YOU'RE GETTING TO SEE HER"
1027,01:04:49.23,01:04:49.23,SHOW A VULNERABLE SIDE THAT MOMS DON'T OFTEN SHOW TO THEIR KIDS?
1028,01:04:53.50,01:04:53.50,>> I JUST WISH I COULD GIVE HER SOME OF MY ENERGY AND STRENGTH
1029,01:04:56.63,01:04:56.63,"BECAUSE I KNOW YOU COULD MAKE IT SEVEN MORE DAYS, BUT I CAN'T."
1030,01:04:59.83,01:04:59.83,SO I JUST GOTTA BE THERE FOR HER AS MUCH AS I CAN AS A DAUGHTER.

1116,01:11:10.47,01:11:10.47,WINNING THIS IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

1118,01:11:18.47,01:11:18.47,ALLIANCE. I'M PRETTY SURE THAT I WAS JUST

1120,01:11:24.50,01:11:24.50,TRIBAL HAVING THE NECKLACE. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
1121,01:11:27.23,01:11:27.23,ANYTHING GOING ON TONIGHT. JUST FOCUS ON WHAT WE NEED TO
1122,01:11:29.67,01:11:29.67,DO. JUST IN CASE ONE OF THEM SOMEHOW
1123,01:11:32.97,01:11:32.97,"HAS AN IDOL, WE HAVE THE NUMBERS."
1124,01:11:36.87,01:11:36.87,WE SHOULD JUST SPLIT THE VOTE JUST TO BE SAFE.
1125,01:11:39.77,01:11:39.77,"THREE ON KEITH, AND AS LONG AS HE DOESN'T PLAY AN IDOL, HE'S"
1126,01:11:42.57,01:11:42.57,GOING HOME. >> EXACTLY.
1127,01:11:44.30,01:11:44.30,">> TRIBAL TONIGHT, THE PLAN IS TO GET KEITH OUT."
1128,01:11:47.07,01:11:47.07,HE'S AN INCREDIBLE THREAT AND NALL IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.
1129,01:11:50.87,01:11:50.87,HE'S BEEN RIGHT IN THE FIGHT IN EVERY SINGLE ONE.
1130,01:11:53.03,01:11:53.03,HE'S WON TWO OF THEM. SO HE NEEDS TO GO.
1131,01:11:57.43,01:11:57.43,">> JON WANTS TO SPLIT THE VOTES, AND THAT'S FINE WITH ME."
1132,01:12:01.77,01:12:01.77,JON IS MY GUY. HE'S GOT MY BACK.
1133,01:12:05.53,01:12:05.53,"SO OUR FAB FIVE IS STRONG, AND WE'RE SENDING KEITH HOME."
1134,01:12:15.50,01:12:15.50,">> ME, YOU, AND JON ON KEITH, AND MISSY AND BAYLOR ON ALEC."

1136,01:12:23.93,01:12:23.93,HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE. >> LET'S SPLIT.
1137,01:12:25.43,01:12:25.43,WE MIGHT AS WELL. >> THAT'S GOOD.
1138,01:12:27.13,01:12:27.13,"JON WINDS IMMUNITY, AND I WAS JUST SO MAD."
1139,01:12:30.43,01:12:30.43,I FELT LIKE EVERYTHING I WAS DOING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF
1140,01:12:32.93,01:12:32.93,"DAYS WAS JUST DOWN THE CRANE, AND IT MAKES ME REALLY DEPRESSED"
1141,01:12:36.53,01:12:36.53,"AT THIS POINT. EVERYTHING DITO GET HIM OUT, AND"
1142,01:12:39.50,01:12:39.50,I CAN'T KICK HIM OUT. I GAVE HIM THE REWARD BECAUSE I
1143,01:12:42.43,01:12:42.43,"WANTED TO BLINDS SIDE HIM. >> TRUST ME, I WAS ON BOARD FOR"
1144,01:12:45.90,01:12:45.90,"TODAY. >> KEITH, STUPID ASS."
1145,01:12:47.40,01:12:47.40,">> I KNOW, HE FREAKED OUT. >> I NEED HIMED TO WIN THAT."
1146,01:12:50.10,01:12:50.10,>> IT COMPLETELY SUCKS THAT JON WON IMMUNITY TODAY.
1147,01:12:53.00,01:12:53.00,NATALIE AND I WERE BANKING ON HIM NOT WINNING AND NOW IT'S
1148,01:12:56.03,01:12:56.03,BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THERE'S
1149,01:12:58.53,01:12:58.53,NOT MUCH TIME LEFT. >> EVERYBODY I WAS CLOSE WITH IN
1150,01:13:09.97,01:13:09.97,THE GAME IS GONE. BESIDES YOU.
1151,01:13:14.53,01:13:14.53,"BUT I'M JUST SAYING, YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE ME OUT, TOO."
1152,01:13:17.90,01:13:17.90,DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE A TOSS-UP BETWEEN KEITH AND MYSELF.
1153,01:13:20.67,01:13:20.67,"BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. I MEAN, MY BACK'S AGAINST THE"
1154,01:13:23.97,01:13:23.97,"WAW, AND I JUST GOTTA START SWINGING."
1155,01:13:27.97,01:13:27.97,"SO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO, WHOEVER I HAVE TO LIE TO, FLIRT"
1156,01:13:31.67,01:13:31.67,"WITH, WHATEVER, I'M WILLING TO DO IT AT THIS POINT."
1157,01:13:33.70,01:13:33.70,"I'M NOT, LIKE, AN EMOTIONAL DUDE."
1158,01:13:36.47,01:13:36.47,"NORMALLY I'M, LIKE, SUPER TOUGH, AND I JUST SAY ( BLEEP ) AND DO"
1159,01:13:39.60,01:13:39.60,MY OWN THING AND I'LL BE FINE. I JUST KIND OF LOST THAT.
1160,01:13:49.53,01:13:49.53,WHAT? WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?
1161,01:13:51.77,01:13:51.77,">> I'M JUST GETTING WISDOM FROM ALEC, AND I LIKE IT."
1162,01:13:55.10,01:13:55.10,>> I'M NOT GIVING YOU WISDOM. IT'S NOT WISDOM.
1163,01:13:58.20,01:13:58.20,>> I'M GETTING TRUE FEELINGS FROM ALEC.
1164,01:14:00.77,01:14:00.77,THAT'S-- THAT'S NEW. >> YEAH.
1165,01:14:02.27,01:14:02.27,I NORMALLY DON'T SHARE MY FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS.
1166,01:14:07.43,01:14:07.43,BUT THIS GAME HAS REALLY DONE SOMETHING TO ME.
1167,01:14:10.43,01:14:10.43,>> ALEC AND I EYE DON'T KNOW. WE DO HAVE SUCH AN UP-AND-DOWN
1168,01:14:16.57,01:14:16.57,"RELATIONSHIP, BROTHER-SISTER, BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND WEIRD KIND"
1169,01:14:19.50,01:14:19.50,"OF THING. STILL, PART OF ME IS GLAD HE'S"
1170,01:14:21.73,01:14:21.73,NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT BECAUSE I SAW A DIFFERENT SIDE OF HIM THEY
1171,01:14:24.97,01:14:24.97,HAVEN'T SEEN IN THIS GAME. AND I LIKED IT.
1172,01:14:27.20,01:14:27.20,I LIKED IT A LOT. JUST BE PATIENT.
1173,01:14:30.97,01:14:30.97,TRUST ME. >> WELL YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IT'S
1174,01:14:42.77,01:14:42.77,"LIKE-- IT'S EITHER YOU OR ALEC TONIGHT, RIGHT?"
1175,01:14:45.13,01:14:45.13,">> OH, YEAH. >> I FEEL LIKE YOU DESERVE TO BE"
1176,01:14:47.50,01:14:47.50,HERE MORE THAN ALEC. BUT I THINK YOU'RE SCARY ON
1177,01:14:52.93,01:14:52.93,IMMUNITY CHALLENGES. THAT'S YET DECISION IS
1178,01:14:54.67,01:14:54.67,"PROBABLY-- >> OH, ME?"
1179,01:14:55.40,01:14:55.40,">> YEAH, COME ON, ALEC IS USELESS."
1180,01:14:58.47,01:14:58.47,">> YEAR, HE IS. >> WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT"
1181,01:15:01.40,01:15:01.40,HIM WINNING. >> I WAS REAL CLOSE AGAIN TO
1182,01:15:03.63,01:15:03.63,"GETTING THE NECKLACE TODAY, AND I COULD KICK MYSELF RIGHT NOW."
1183,01:15:06.27,01:15:06.27,I NEEDED IT. I NEEDED IT.
1184,01:15:08.30,01:15:08.30,EVERYBODY KNOWS I NEED IT. IT IS A BAD FEELING.
1185,01:15:12.83,01:15:12.83,"IT'S BURNING YESTERDAY, AND IT'S BURNING AGAIN TODAY THAT THEY'RE"
1186,01:15:15.37,01:15:15.37,JUST LAYING UP OVER THERE. AND Y'ALL ARE TAKING THEM TO THE
1187,01:15:19.27,01:15:19.27,END? YOU ALL COULD SEND A MESSAGE
1188,01:15:20.73,01:15:20.73,JUST LIKE THAT. TAKE ALEC OUT OR TAKE ME OUT BUT
1189,01:15:24.43,01:15:24.43,YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EVENTUALLY TAKE EACH OTHER OUT.
1190,01:15:26.73,01:15:26.73,>> I HAVE BEEN FEELING COMPLETELY HELPLESS TO DO
1191,01:15:29.17,01:15:29.17,"ANYTHING AT THIS POINT, BUT I JUST REALIZED, OH, MY GOD, I"
1192,01:15:33.37,01:15:33.37,COULD TOTALLY FLIP THE ENTIRE GAME.
1193,01:15:36.37,01:15:36.37,>> YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO THINK WHO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE THREE

1198,01:15:50.30,01:15:50.30,"FOR KEITH, BUT FIFLIP, AND KEITH VOTES ALEC, ALEC WILL GO HOME"

1200,01:16:01.60,01:16:01.60,BLINDS SIDE JON. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR
1201,01:16:03.90,01:16:03.90,TONIGHT? >> I GUESS I'LL VOTE FOR ALEC.
1202,01:16:05.67,01:16:05.67,">> FIDO THIS AND BETRAY JON, IT WILL BE MY BIGGEST MOVE YET."
1203,01:16:09.13,01:16:09.13,"THE ONLY SCARY THING FOR ME, THEN, IS DEALING WITH EVERYTHING"
1204,01:16:11.93,01:16:11.93,WHEN I COME BACK TO CAMP BECAUSE JON IS GOING TO BE REALLY
1205,01:16:15.30,01:16:15.30,PISSED. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'M THINK.
1206,01:16:18.33,01:16:18.33,I VOTE ALEC TONIGHT INSTEAD OF KEITH.
1207,01:16:20.87,01:16:20.87,YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY. KEITH IS GOOD ON IMMUNITY
1208,01:16:24.27,01:16:24.27,CHALLENGES AND WOULD BE AGAINST JON.

1210,01:16:30.63,01:16:30.63,DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO GET RID OF ALEC RIGHT NOW.
1211,01:16:34.20,01:16:34.20,IT'S A HUGE RISK BECAUSE JON COULD FREAK OUT AND TURN ON US
1212,01:16:37.53,01:16:37.53,IN A HEARTBEAT. ALEC WILL DO WHATEVER WE SAY
1213,01:16:41.93,01:16:41.93,AFTER KEITH'S GONE. >> THE THING SI DON'T KNOW IF
1214,01:16:44.90,01:16:44.90,"IT'S WORTH IT ME GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH MY ALLIANCE, SO I'M"
1215,01:16:48.20,01:16:48.20,"GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION, I GUESS, TONIGHT."

1232,01:17:58.47,01:17:58.47,DOWN TO AT THIS POINT. >> Jeff: SO IF THAT STRATEGY
1233,01:18:02.83,01:18:02.83,"COMES OUT TO PLAY, KEITH, THEN YOU WOULD BE THE OBVIOUS TARGET"
1234,01:18:05.90,01:18:05.90,BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS IN CHALLENGES.

1238,01:18:17.83,01:18:17.83,SOMETHING? OR IS THIS JUST THE WAY THIS
1239,01:18:19.30,01:18:19.30,"GROUP IS GOING, THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT ANYONE TO BEAT US?"
1240,01:18:23.67,01:18:23.67,">> UM, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE. BUT I WOULD SAY IF SOMEBODY'S"

1242,01:18:32.40,01:18:32.40,BUT I THINK THERE IS A LOT MORE THAT GOES UNDER IT.

1252,01:19:10.03,01:19:10.03,AND THAT IS YOU GUYS ARE LIVING IN THE JUNGLE WITH NOTHING.
1253,01:19:14.07,01:19:14.07,TRY TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE FOR ME.
1254,01:19:17.50,01:19:17.50,>> I ACTUALLY THINK BACK JUST TO THIS MOST RECENT REWARD.
1255,01:19:20.87,01:19:20.87,"IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE SMALLEST THING, BUT IT BROUGHT OUT A"
1256,01:19:24.83,01:19:24.83,"TRAY, AND THERE WAS AN ACTUAL WINE GLASS ON IT."
1257,01:19:27.90,01:19:27.90,I'M A HUGE WINE FAN. THAT'S BECAUSE MY DAD INTRODUCED
1258,01:19:30.97,01:19:30.97,"ME TO WINE, AND HE'S DYING OF BRAIN CANCER RIGHT NOW, AND, YOU"
1259,01:19:34.10,01:19:34.10,"KNOW, BEING OUT HERE JUST REMINDS YOU WHAT'S IMPORTANT."
1260,01:19:39.13,01:19:39.13,"AND WHEN I WON THIS IMMUNITY TODAY, I TEARED UP, BECAUSE I"
1261,01:19:42.60,01:19:42.60,KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT MY DAD IS GOING TO
1262,01:19:45.73,01:19:45.73,"BE ABLE TO SAY TO ME, ""SON, I'M PROUD OF YOU FOR THAT."""
1263,01:19:48.77,01:19:48.77,AND I DON'T HAVE VERY MANY OF THOSE MOMENTS LEFT WITH HIM.
1264,01:19:52.57,01:19:52.57,">> Jeff: WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR DAD SAY THE WORDS ""SON, I'M"
1265,01:19:56.50,01:19:56.50,"PROUD OF YOU,"" WHAT IS THE FEELING INSIDE?"
1266,01:20:00.27,01:20:00.27,>> I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS REGRET.
1267,01:20:07.37,01:20:07.37,BECAUSE MY DAD AND I REALLY ONLY STARTED TO BOND A LOT THE PAST
1268,01:20:11.13,01:20:11.13,TWO OR THREE YEARS. AND I CAN ADD SO MUCH MORE TIME
1269,01:20:16.57,01:20:16.57,"AND COULD HAVE BUILT SO MUCH MORE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM,"
1270,01:20:21.03,01:20:21.03,AND I LOOK BACK AT ALL THE YEARS THAT I WAS STUBBORN AND THAT I
1271,01:20:25.73,01:20:25.73,"WOULDN'T LET HIM IN, THAT I-- I REGRET IT EVERY DAY."
1272,01:20:31.60,01:20:31.60,"I REGRET SO MUCH OF IT. >> Jeff: KEITH, YOU'RE A DAD."
1273,01:20:39.77,01:20:39.77,YOUR SON IS SITTING RIGHT OVER THERE ON THE JURY.
1274,01:20:42.10,01:20:42.10,"THIS GAME IS COMPLICATED. BECAUSE ON ONE HAND, THIS IS A"
1275,01:20:47.83,01:20:47.83,VERY PERSONAL SHARING THAT JON IS DOING.
1276,01:20:49.93,01:20:49.93,"AND YET, THERE'S THIS CRAZY GAME."
1277,01:20:53.67,01:20:53.67,"AND IT'S ONLY A GAME. BUT YOU CAN'T HELP BUT THINK,"
1278,01:20:57.30,01:20:57.30,"MAN, COULD HIS TRAGEDY WORK AGAINST ME IN THIS GAME?"
1279,01:21:02.40,01:21:02.40,AND IS THAT FAIR? >> I-- I GUESS IT'S ALL FAIR ON
1280,01:21:07.13,01:21:07.13,"""SURVIVOR,"" BUT I HOPE THEM FOUR OVER THERE ARE SHARPER THAN"
1281,01:21:10.17,01:21:10.17,THAT. I'M GOING TO BE OVER THERE
1282,01:21:11.87,01:21:11.87,EVENTUALLY. A LOT OF US ARE.
1283,01:21:13.20,01:21:13.20,AND I HOPE WE'RE SHARPER THAN THAT TO SEE THROUGH SOME OF THIS
1284,01:21:17.07,01:21:17.07,"STUFF. >> Jeff: SO, KEITH, IF YOU'RE"
1285,01:21:18.00,01:21:18.00,"THE TARGET, AND YOU KNOW THAT, WHAT DO YOU CO?"
1286,01:21:20.77,01:21:20.77,BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LAY DOWN AND DIE.
1287,01:21:23.13,01:21:23.13,">> THAT'S RIGHT, JEFF. I'VE GOT A VOTE HERE."
1288,01:21:25.40,01:21:25.40,"IF WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING, USE MY VOTE."
1289,01:21:29.07,01:21:29.07,SEE WHO THEY THINK. SEE IF THEY'LL TAKE ME UP ON IT.
1290,01:21:31.90,01:21:31.90,">> Jeff: NATALIE, THIS IS WHY TONIGHT'S VOTE IS SO CRITICAL."
1291,01:21:35.60,01:21:35.60,IT'S A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEBODY IN THIS FIVE TO MAKE A
1292,01:21:38.60,01:21:38.60,"GIANT MOVE AND SAY TO THE JURY, ""I CAME TO PLAY, AND I CAME TO"
1293,01:21:43.17,01:21:43.17,"WIN."" >> YEAH, I FEEL LIKE NO MATTER"
1294,01:21:45.20,01:21:45.20,"WHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I KNOW EVERYBODY IS THINKING ABOUT"
1295,01:21:47.57,01:21:47.57,"ONE THING, WHICH IS THEY WANT TO WIN A MILLION BUCKS."
1296,01:21:50.87,01:21:50.87,"SO NO MATTER WHAT ALLIANCE WE'RE IN, EVERYBODY IS LOOKING OUT FOR"
1297,01:21:53.97,01:21:53.97,THEMSELVES. AND I KNOW IT'S COMING AND IT'S
1298,01:21:55.73,01:21:55.73,"SCARY, BUT TONIGHT I'M CONFIDENT THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL OF US ARE ON"
1299,01:21:58.40,01:21:58.40,"THE SAME PAGE, NO SURPRISES WHEN IT COMES TO THE ALLIANCE OF"
1300,01:22:02.17,01:22:02.17,"FIVE. >> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, IT IS TIME"
1301,01:22:06.87,01:22:06.87,"TO VOTE. BAYLOR, YOU'RE UP."
1302,01:22:21.30,01:22:21.30,">> SORRY, BROTHER. IT'S EITHER YOU OR ME."
1303,01:22:24.43,01:22:24.43,HAD TO DO IT. >> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
1304,01:22:50.03,01:22:50.03,VOTES. IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
1305,01:22:59.97,01:22:59.97,"IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO."
1306,01:23:08.00,01:23:08.00,"OKAY. ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE"
1307,01:23:08.77,01:23:08.77,DECISION IS FINAL. THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE
1308,01:23:09.73,01:23:09.73,ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
1309,01:23:11.07,01:23:11.07,I'LL READ THE VOTES. FIRST VOTE.
1310,01:23:15.80,01:23:15.80,KEITH. ALEC.
1311,01:23:23.77,01:23:23.77,KEITH. ALEC.
1312,01:23:27.07,01:23:27.07,"WE'RE TIED. TWO VOTES KEITH, TWO VOTES ALEC."
1313,01:23:32.43,01:23:32.43,THAT'S THREE VOTES KEITH. WE'RE TIED.
1314,01:23:39.23,01:23:39.23,"THREE VOTES ALEC, THREE VOTES KEITH, ONE VOTE LEFT."
1315,01:23:44.50,01:23:44.50,"11th PERSON VOTED OUT AND THE FIFTH MEMBER OF OUR JURY,"
1316,01:23:49.43,01:23:49.43,ALEC. YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
1317,01:24:04.33,01:24:04.33,"ALEC, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN. >> Jeff: WELL, BASED ON THE"
1318,01:24:20.57,01:24:20.57,"REACTIONS AFTER THE VOTE, THIS TIGHT ALLIANCE OF FIVE MIGHT NOT"
1319,01:24:24.20,01:24:24.20,"BE SO TIGHT. KEITH, THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR"
1320,01:24:27.13,01:24:27.13,YOU. >> SURE IS.
1321,01:24:28.50,01:24:28.50,>> Jeff: GRAB YOUR TORCHES. HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
1322,01:24:31.97,01:24:31.97,GOOD NIGHT. >> JEFF: STAY TUNED FOR SCENES
1323,01:24:42.03,01:24:42.03,FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE. >> Jeff:NEXT TIME ON
1324,01:24:49.77,01:24:49.77,"""SURVIVOR"": >> Jeff: NATALIE WON'T REST"
1325,01:24:52.53,01:24:52.53,UNTIL SHE GETS REREVENGE ON JON. >> I WANT JON OUT BAD.
1326,01:24:57.63,01:24:57.63,>> Jeff: BUT ONE MOMENT COULD CHANGE THE FATE OF THE GAME.
1327,01:25:03.30,01:25:03.30,>> YOU NEED AN X-RAY. >> IT'S FRUSTRATING!
1328,01:25:13.27,01:25:13.27,>> I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY MY AMBITION I CLEARLY WASN'T GOOD
1329,01:25:18.17,01:25:18.17,AT ANY OF THE CHALLENGES. AND THE ODDS WERE AGAINST ME FOR
1330,01:25:20.77,01:25:20.77,A LONG TIME IN THE GAME. AND I JUST KEPT FIGHTING AND I'M
1331,01:25:24.33,01:25:24.33,NOT COMPLETELY CONTENT BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO FURTHER.
1332,01:25:26.63,01:25:26.63,"BUT I GAVE IT MY ALL. I DIDN'T WIN, BUT AT LEAST I"
1333,01:25:30.47,01:25:30.47,BEAT DREW. SO THAT COUNTS AS A WIN FOR ME.
