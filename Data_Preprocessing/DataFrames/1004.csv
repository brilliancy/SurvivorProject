2,00:00:02.58,00:00:02.58,Survivor: >> Everything I say you have
3,00:00:04.88,00:00:04.88,some snotty remark! >> PROBST: Caryn and Katie went
4,00:00:06.25,00:00:06.25,head-to-head. >> Get off me!
5,00:00:08.25,00:00:08.25,>> She's crazy. She's completely lost it.
6,00:00:10.33,00:00:10.33,>> PROBST: Survivors ready. At the reward challenge...
7,00:00:13.00,00:00:13.00,Go! ...as the tribes faced off
8,00:00:15.92,00:00:15.92,"in hand-to-hand combat, Koror took a beating..."
9,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,Angie dunks Gregg! ...and Ulong dunked their way
10,00:00:22.21,00:00:22.21,to victory... Ulong wins reward!
11,00:00:25.67,00:00:25.67,...winning material and a sewing kit.
12,00:00:28.33,00:00:28.33,">> Ulong! >> PROBST: Back at Ulong,"
13,00:00:31.12,00:00:31.12,although morale was up... >> That was so awesome.
14,00:00:33.46,00:00:33.46,>> We totally kicked their ass. >> PROBST: ...Bobby Jon grew
15,00:00:36.96,00:00:36.96,frustrated. >> I'm very disappointed with
16,00:00:38.21,00:00:38.21,"my tribe right now. >> Oh, so close."
17,00:00:41.08,00:00:41.08,>> Especially Kim. I don't think she understands
18,00:00:44.17,00:00:44.17,the value of work. >> PROBST: At Koror...
19,00:00:47.67,00:00:47.67,">> It's definitely a sea krait, so be careful."
20,00:00:50.08,00:00:50.08,>> PROBST: ...the tribe tangled with some deadly creatures.
21,00:00:52.04,00:00:52.04,>> That thing right there. It's coming closer.
22,00:00:54.21,00:00:54.21,This is probably the stupidest thing I've done in a while.
23,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,>> It's a game of survival and we're going to get a shark.
24,00:00:59.21,00:00:59.21,">> Okay, here comes one. >> PROBST: Before the immunity"
25,00:01:03.08,00:01:03.08,"challenge, Ulong faced a setback when Jeff sprained his ankle."
26,00:01:07.25,00:01:07.25,>> It's totally my luck. I hurt my ankle and we have
27,00:01:09.58,00:01:09.58,a challenge the very next morning.
28,00:01:11.04,00:01:11.04,"If I mess up today, it's on my shoulders."
29,00:01:13.46,00:01:13.46,">> PROBST: Go! Right away, Jeff's unclipping."
30,00:01:16.50,00:01:16.50,"Jeff took no chances and bailed out of the challenge, but after"
31,00:01:20.71,00:01:20.71,"a long test of strength and endurance, it was Koror who"
32,00:01:23.04,00:01:23.04,pulled through. Koror wins their third immunity
33,00:01:27.67,00:01:27.67,challenge in a row. >> Whoo!
34,00:01:30.96,00:01:30.96,">> PROBST: Back at camp, Jeff gathered his tribe."
35,00:01:33.83,00:01:33.83,I know there's no possible way that I can get to the end
36,00:01:36.08,00:01:36.08,"with a busted-up ankle. If I stay in here, you guys"
37,00:01:38.71,00:01:38.71,aren't going to get to the end. >> PROBST: Some were not
38,00:01:41.04,00:01:41.04,convinced. >> I feel very strongly
39,00:01:42.75,00:01:42.75,that Jeff should stay. We should get rid of Kim
40,00:01:45.12,00:01:45.12,for sure. >> PROBST: But at Tribal
41,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,"Council, Kim was spared when the tribe honored Jeff's"
42,00:01:51.04,00:01:51.04,"wishes and voted him out. Jeff, the tribe has spoken."
43,00:01:55.79,00:01:55.79,15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
44,00:03:26.46,00:03:26.46,>> I can't believe this is all that's left.
45,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,"We started out with, like, so many people."
46,00:03:35.46,00:03:35.46,">> I know. >> Tonight at Tribal Council,"
47,00:03:39.12,00:03:39.12,Jeff went home. I am very sad he's not here.
48,00:03:42.54,00:03:42.54,He's great for the team. He's a great friend.
49,00:03:44.58,00:03:44.58,It absolutely is horrible to lose the strongest player on
50,00:03:48.21,00:03:48.21,"your tribe, but that's what he had wanted, and so that's"
51,00:03:52.12,00:03:52.12,what we did. >> Koror is using strategy when
52,00:03:55.88,00:03:55.88,it comes to the immunity challenge.
53,00:03:58.33,00:03:58.33,">> Yeah, but they're a weak-ass team."
54,00:04:00.25,00:04:00.25,There's obviously something going wrong because they're
55,00:04:03.08,00:04:03.08,not in shape and they're kicking our asses.
56,00:04:05.21,00:04:05.21,>> We're not going to Tribal again.
57,00:04:06.75,00:04:06.75,You guys understand me? I'm going to stomp
58,00:04:09.83,00:04:09.83,anybody's ass that lags. You know what I mean.
59,00:04:15.21,00:04:15.21,">> He means it in a good way, though."
60,00:04:18.29,00:04:18.29,>> I don't know. This tribe right now doesn't
61,00:04:19.96,00:04:19.96,"have a lot of togetherness. and closeness, like we thought"
62,00:04:21.71,00:04:21.71,"we had. As it's built right now,"
63,00:04:24.04,00:04:24.04,"everybody's self-esteem's getting down, but I'm hoping"
64,00:04:26.25,00:04:26.25,"we're going to turn it around. I hope we do learn something,"
65,00:04:30.08,00:04:30.08,"but right now, I don't think we have."
66,00:04:47.12,00:04:47.12,>> Tree mail. Uh...
67,00:04:51.50,00:04:51.50,">> I knew it. >> ""Today you must choose one"
68,00:04:54.29,00:04:54.29,and only one tribal representative to make some
69,00:04:56.88,00:04:56.88,important choices. The tribe will then have to
70,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,"live with those decisions."" >> Katie and I went to go get"
71,00:05:02.58,00:05:02.58,tree mail this morning and it basically says the we need
72,00:05:05.42,00:05:05.42,"to send a tribal representative out, and that we have to live"
73,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,with the decisions that we make. >> We need to figure out
74,00:05:11.62,00:05:11.62,what it is. It could be a person swap.
75,00:05:13.75,00:05:13.75,">> Yeah, or what if the person goes doesn't get to come back?"
76,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,">> I think Gregg should go. >> I'm not crazy about it,"
77,00:05:24.38,00:05:24.38,but I'm not opposed to it. >> Everyone else is up for it?
78,00:05:29.21,00:05:29.21,>> I am. >> I would definitely be willing
79,00:05:31.46,00:05:31.46,to go. >> I would do it.
80,00:05:34.12,00:05:34.12,>> I would do it. >> I'll speak right out
81,00:05:36.83,00:05:36.83,"on that and do a vote. Ian, you've made many good"
82,00:05:39.12,00:05:39.12,"decisions, you've been the team leader here."
83,00:05:42.62,00:05:42.62,You want to go? I say you go.
84,00:05:44.08,00:05:44.08,">> Yeah, he'd be good. >> Today we were volunteering"
85,00:05:47.21,00:05:47.21,"on who wanted to go, me, Caryn and Janu all volunteered."
86,00:05:51.42,00:05:51.42,But it's like nobody listened to us.
87,00:05:53.00,00:05:53.00,"They just said, ""So, should it be Gregg or should be it Ian?"""
88,00:05:55.54,00:05:55.54,"""I want to go."" ""Well, should it be Gregg"
89,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,"or should it be Ian?"" ""I want to go,"" I just kept"
90,00:06:01.12,00:06:01.12,repeating myself. >> I just don't want to lose
91,00:06:02.54,00:06:02.54,you. >> I'll be back.
92,00:06:03.42,00:06:03.42,We'll see each other again. Is that cool?
93,00:06:06.04,00:06:06.04,>> It's definitely the tribe's vote.
94,00:06:07.04,00:06:07.04,Everybody seems to go for Ian. I'm not going to fight for it.
95,00:06:09.62,00:06:09.62,"By picking the team leader, the separation of the group"
96,00:06:12.58,00:06:12.58,"is just obvious. Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian"
97,00:06:14.29,00:06:14.29,"and Tom are one unit, so that makes five against four."
98,00:06:19.42,00:06:19.42,"Once we saw them all band together, it was obvious that"
99,00:06:22.71,00:06:22.71,we're definitely the underdogs here.
100,00:06:30.88,00:06:30.88,">> ""Today you must choose one and only one."""
101,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,>> So somebody is going to be the top dog here.
102,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,"We represent you. >> Hey, we're picking out of a"
103,00:06:40.21,00:06:40.21,hat. >> How do you feel about
104,00:06:44.88,00:06:44.88,"doing it, Kim? >> I'm fine with it."
105,00:06:47.71,00:06:47.71,"I think you're good at it, too, though."
106,00:06:51.50,00:06:51.50,>> Maybe we'll draw straws or something.
107,00:06:55.12,00:06:55.12,>> I don't know. I don't agree with the
108,00:06:59.04,00:06:59.04,drawing straws. It seems like nobody likes
109,00:07:01.04,00:07:01.04,to sit down and think about it for a second.
110,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,"It's very impulsive, and I'm sure that it won't be the best"
111,00:07:07.54,00:07:07.54,decision once it's made. >> Want to see what the
112,00:07:10.38,00:07:10.38,challenge is and then go from there?
113,00:07:12.21,00:07:12.21,>> Yeah. We have to go fishing right now.
114,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00,"Let's go. >> Yeah, let's do that."
115,00:07:15.46,00:07:15.46,>> Let's go fishing. >> There's a boat coming.
116,00:07:36.75,00:07:36.75,>> This is like some kind of World War II thing.
117,00:07:39.04,00:07:39.04,">> It's on its way. >> Oh, look at it."
118,00:07:43.29,00:07:43.29,">> PROBST: What's going on, Koror?"
119,00:07:45.42,00:07:45.42,>> Hey. >> PROBST: Who's the
120,00:07:51.04,00:07:51.04,representative? >> Ian.
121,00:07:52.29,00:07:52.29,">> PROBST: Ian, come on up. >> Bye, Ian."
122,00:07:54.08,00:07:54.08,">> See you guys. >> PROBST: All right, Ian,"
123,00:07:57.42,00:07:57.42,"for today's reward challenge, your tribe is going to build"
124,00:07:59.79,00:07:59.79,"a bathroom, two sections: a toilet area and a shower"
125,00:08:04.08,00:08:04.08,"and a wash area. To help you build your bathroom,"
126,00:08:06.42,00:08:06.42,we go to the Home Depot toolshed.
127,00:08:11.21,00:08:11.21,"(all exclaiming) >> Oh, my God."
128,00:08:14.08,00:08:14.08,">> Oh, my God. >> Who'd have thought I'd be"
129,00:08:17.12,00:08:17.12,that excited to see tools? >> PROBST: A few items.
130,00:08:19.04,00:08:19.04,"You have a bush shower, a shower curtain, some rings,"
131,00:08:23.21,00:08:23.21,"toilet seat, some twine, wire, rope, lots of nails, right?"
132,00:08:27.96,00:08:27.96,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: In addition, timber,"
133,00:08:31.88,00:08:31.88,and you get to pick six tools from the toolshed-- six tools
134,00:08:35.21,00:08:35.21,that you will build your bathroom with and six tools you
135,00:08:38.08,00:08:38.08,will keep for the remainder of your time out here.
136,00:08:40.25,00:08:40.25,>> Jeff gave me the choice to pick six tools out of
137,00:08:42.25,00:08:42.25,his toolbox. It was a difficult decision.
138,00:08:44.25,00:08:44.25,But my dad owns a construction company and I
139,00:08:46.08,00:08:46.08,"grew up on a farm, so it worked out okay."
140,00:08:48.96,00:08:48.96,>> PROBST: What's the last item going to be?
141,00:08:50.92,00:08:50.92,">> It's going to be this one. >> PROBST: All right, you have"
142,00:08:53.29,00:08:53.29,one more decision. >> Mm-hmm.
143,00:08:54.54,00:08:54.54,>> PROBST: Koror now has three extra members.
144,00:08:56.12,00:08:56.12,You're sitting three people out. They cannot participate in the
145,00:08:58.21,00:08:58.21,planning or the execution of this challenge.
146,00:09:02.00,00:09:02.00,"Keep in mind, Ian, you cannot sit the same people out in"
147,00:09:05.46,00:09:05.46,"back-to-back challenges. >> Oh, that's right."
148,00:09:07.04,00:09:07.04,"Okay, we have a immunity challenge coming up, too."
149,00:09:09.25,00:09:09.25,"Okay, so we're going to sit out Jen, Coby, Janu."
150,00:09:14.00,00:09:14.00,">> PROBST: Okay. Tomorrow morning, I'm going to"
151,00:09:15.62,00:09:15.62,come back with a judge. The person doing
152,00:09:17.83,00:09:17.83,the judging is Jesse. He's got a degree
153,00:09:19.54,00:09:19.54,in Construction Management. He's been with the show since
154,00:09:21.42,00:09:21.42,"day one, and his team builds all the challenges out here."
155,00:09:25.58,00:09:25.58,He knows what's possible to be built out here.
156,00:09:28.88,00:09:28.88,"For the winning tribe, Jesse will come back"
157,00:09:31.88,00:09:31.88,"with our entire construction department, and they will build"
158,00:09:33.92,00:09:33.92,a shelter the likes of which has never been seen.
159,00:09:39.17,00:09:39.17,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Worth doing?"
160,00:09:40.79,00:09:40.79,>> Absolutely. >> PROBST: All right.
161,00:09:42.29,00:09:42.29,Get somebody to come help you get all of your tools
162,00:09:45.21,00:09:45.21,"and get to work. >> Nice job, Ian."
163,00:09:47.88,00:09:47.88,>> Are we okay? Yeah?
164,00:09:50.08,00:09:50.08,"As far as my choices go, I hope the tribe's happy with it,"
165,00:09:53.04,00:09:53.04,"but I'm feeling fantastic, the adrenaline's running."
166,00:10:11.67,00:10:11.67,">> Good job, James. Bigger than what we've"
167,00:10:14.58,00:10:14.58,been getting. >> We found Nemo.
168,00:10:26.04,00:10:26.04,">> PROBST: Ulong, come on in. Good to see you guys"
169,00:10:28.38,00:10:28.38,out here fishing. >> We're trying.
170,00:10:30.29,00:10:30.29,>> We try. We try.
171,00:10:31.21,00:10:31.21,">> PROBST: All right, so, the reason I'm out here--"
172,00:10:33.50,00:10:33.50,who's your representative? >> Can we ask questions or no?
173,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,>> Can we ask you questions? >> PROBST: You have not picked
174,00:10:39.04,00:10:39.04,a representative yet? You guys don't have a leader.
175,00:10:42.00,00:10:42.00,You can't even pick a representative.
176,00:10:43.33,00:10:43.33,Give me somebody. >> James.
177,00:10:46.25,00:10:46.25,>> James. >> James.
178,00:10:47.62,00:10:47.62,">> PROBST: James, get up here on the barge."
179,00:10:49.71,00:10:49.71,>> You okay with that? >> All right.
180,00:10:51.21,00:10:51.21,>> All right. >> PROBST: James is worried.
181,00:10:53.21,00:10:53.21,>> I wasn't trying to be the leader.
182,00:10:55.25,00:10:55.25,"They picked me, but luckily they did pick me"
183,00:10:59.12,00:10:59.12,because if they didn't we wouldn't have got
184,00:11:00.71,00:11:00.71,the tools we needed to build our lavatory.
185,00:11:03.67,00:11:03.67,My stuff. I used to build houses.
186,00:11:06.92,00:11:06.92,>> PROBST: So you've got a background in construction.
187,00:11:09.25,00:11:09.25,>> I got a background. This is hatchet with a hammer
188,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,"on one end, hatchet on the other."
189,00:11:14.92,00:11:14.92,">> Good choice, James. >> PROBST: Okay, here's what's"
190,00:11:16.96,00:11:16.96,what's going to happen. Some of the guys from the
191,00:11:19.04,00:11:19.04,"construction department are going to build,"

196,00:11:29.83,00:11:29.83,"but when a reward challenge is at stake, somebody's"
197,00:11:32.04,00:11:32.04,"got to step up and say, ""Hey, get up off your asses"
198,00:11:35.83,00:11:35.83,"and let's get to work."" >> The Koror construction crew"
199,00:11:50.17,00:11:50.17,"is in high gear. We have a plan now, so we're"
200,00:11:53.58,00:11:53.58,gonna pull all the stops out. Koror is going nuts with this
201,00:11:56.92,00:11:56.92,thing. >> Nice.
202,00:12:00.12,00:12:00.12,">> Got a nice pathway going. >> Willard, we couldn't have"
203,00:12:03.08,00:12:03.08,planned it better ourselves. Look at that notch-- my God!

211,00:12:32.38,00:12:32.38,That's what he does for a living.
212,00:12:34.04,00:12:34.04,He's an officer in the fire department.
213,00:12:36.00,00:12:36.00,He's highly motivated. He works hard.
214,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,He's our little motor that makes the train run.
215,00:12:47.75,00:12:47.75,>> Here we go. Add water.
216,00:12:52.17,00:12:52.17,>> Every leader for every project is always Tom.
217,00:12:56.21,00:12:56.21,That's the way it is in this tribe.

222,00:13:16.83,00:13:16.83,"and I want a little bit of elbow room, you know,"
223,00:13:19.38,00:13:19.38,so... 35 inches right here. Mark it.

227,00:13:30.92,00:13:30.92,"a little outhouse, so we can win us a shelter."
228,00:13:34.12,00:13:34.12,"So measure from right there, down there."

232,00:13:45.00,00:13:45.00,because this is going to not be real sturdy?
233,00:13:47.46,00:13:47.46,">> Oh, honey. >> What?"
234,00:13:49.62,00:13:49.62,">> We've got to nail it. >> Yeah, I know."

244,00:14:17.04,00:14:17.04,When I have something broken at my house I fix it.
245,00:14:19.83,00:14:19.83,"Landlord don't fix it, I fix it. >> What's wrong?"
246,00:14:25.00,00:14:25.00,>> I'm really weak. Like I need food.

248,00:14:30.12,00:14:30.12,better than I can without it. Like I'm so dizzy I could
249,00:14:32.75,00:14:32.75,pass out right now. >> What do you want to do?
250,00:14:35.46,00:14:35.46,>> I don't know. >> Why don't you start taking

277,00:16:22.96,00:16:22.96,and letting the beast attack the beast.

302,00:17:38.04,00:17:38.04,"is it? >> No, it's not."
303,00:17:39.88,00:17:39.88,>> The tour was terrific. It was taking them through

305,00:17:45.08,00:17:45.08,what we came up with. I'm very confident.
306,00:17:49.25,00:17:49.25,I'd be surprised if we didn't win and we need this.
307,00:17:51.62,00:17:51.62,"We have Rat City, USA. And we need a shelter."
308,00:17:54.04,00:17:54.04,">> Yeah, let's have a look at the shower."
309,00:17:55.96,00:17:55.96,"All right. I like the path, a nice touch."
310,00:17:58.21,00:17:58.21,">> We mounted the actual shower above the tree, and you're"

318,00:18:19.71,00:18:19.71,">> No problem. >> PROBST: So here's the deal,"
319,00:18:21.12,00:18:21.12,guys: Jesse's is going to judge you based on creativity
320,00:18:23.79,00:18:23.79,and functionality. If he decides that
321,00:18:25.25,00:18:25.25,your bathroom is the best... you'll know it.
322,00:18:27.92,00:18:27.92,We'll return. Fair enough?
323,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17,>> Fair enough. Thank you.

328,00:18:39.58,00:18:39.58,very impressed. I don't think there's any way
329,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,we can lose this one. >> Ulong.
330,00:18:51.38,00:18:51.38,>> Here he comes. >> Uh-oh.
331,00:18:54.33,00:18:54.33,Hurry. They didn't even see it.
332,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,">> They didn't even see it. >> Hurry, hurry."
333,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,They're right here now. >> That's it-- stop.
334,00:19:03.21,00:19:03.21,>> Right here. >> Put the shovel up.
335,00:19:04.54,00:19:04.54,Put the shovel up. >> PROBST: Looks like you guys
336,00:19:06.79,00:19:06.79,are still working. This is Jesse Jensen--
337,00:19:08.33,00:19:08.33,he's the guy I told you about. You want to give him
338,00:19:10.75,00:19:10.75,a tour or you want him just to look around?
339,00:19:12.62,00:19:12.62,"James is going to do that. >> You ready for a tour, buddy?"
340,00:19:15.08,00:19:15.08,">> I'm ready for a tour. ""For a good time"

346,00:19:32.21,00:19:32.21,but they have. I don't brush my teeth

351,00:19:47.83,00:19:47.83,It's a lot nicer than we thought it would ever be.
352,00:19:49.71,00:19:49.71,>> Let's have a look around the back.

360,00:20:13.33,00:20:13.33,not coming back. >> Fair enough.

372,00:20:54.08,00:20:54.08,proud. But you never know what

377,00:21:28.21,00:21:28.21,(cheering) Yeah!
378,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,">> All right! Yeah, bring it!"
379,00:21:33.04,00:21:33.04,">> Oh, my g... >> Yeah!"
380,00:21:35.29,00:21:35.29,"Yes! >> Come on, cartwheels"
381,00:21:37.58,00:21:37.58,down the beach! (cheering)
382,00:21:41.46,00:21:41.46,The barge boat came around the corner again.
383,00:21:43.33,00:21:43.33,"We could see the Home Depot sign on it, and there was a lot"
384,00:21:46.33,00:21:46.33,"of, lot of joy in camp. >> Yeah!"
385,00:21:49.58,00:21:49.58,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, we're going"
386,00:21:53.75,00:21:53.75,to sleep good tonight. >> We totally deserve this.
387,00:21:57.04,00:21:57.04,>> Bring it home. >> Yeah.
388,00:21:59.17,00:21:59.17,>> I knew it. >> Yes!
389,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,">> They'll be back. >> I don't know, man."
390,00:22:17.00,00:22:17.00,I'm kind of thinking that we may have lost.
391,00:22:19.67,00:22:19.67,Still trying to keep hope up because the sun hasn't set
392,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"all the way. It's not dark yet,"
393,00:22:24.96,00:22:24.96,"but it's looking kind of grim. (hammer pounding, saw buzzing)"
394,00:22:43.62,00:22:43.62,">> Instead, we get a construction crew."
395,00:22:45.12,00:22:45.12,"Like, come on. We have a new shelter going on,"
396,00:22:49.21,00:22:49.21,"so, uh... so a good day for Koror,"
397,00:22:51.88,00:22:51.88,for sure. Everything worked out the way
398,00:22:53.58,00:22:53.58,"it's supposed to. Oh, it's a frickin' palace."
399,00:22:56.42,00:22:56.42,It's like the Taj Mahal. It's fantastic.
400,00:22:58.46,00:22:58.46,"Gosh, thank you so much. >> No problem."
401,00:23:00.33,00:23:00.33,You're welcome. >> It's fantastic.
402,00:23:05.25,00:23:05.25,>> I can't even begin to explain how great our shelter is--
403,00:23:08.62,00:23:08.62,"it's beautiful. It's not even a shelter,"
404,00:23:11.29,00:23:11.29,it's a home. We've got a hammock in there
405,00:23:14.12,00:23:14.12,"and a lantern, and they built us a picnic table"
406,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,"and, like, a little platform for us to just hang out on."
407,00:23:19.83,00:23:19.83,It makes the quality of life here so much better.
408,00:23:22.54,00:23:22.54,">> We got something else here for you, a little housewarming."
409,00:23:25.38,00:23:25.38,>> Oh...! >> What is it?
410,00:23:28.04,00:23:28.04,(cheering) >> Yeah!
411,00:23:31.42,00:23:31.42,"Yeah! >> To you guys, thank you."
412,00:23:34.71,00:23:34.71,">> Thank you. >> Oh, this feels so good."
413,00:23:37.25,00:23:37.25,">> Thank you. >> Thanks a lot, guys."
414,00:23:39.08,00:23:39.08,Awesome. Thank you. Thank you.
415,00:23:42.00,00:23:42.00,">> As if the shelter wasn't enough, these wonderful people"
416,00:23:44.96,00:23:44.96,"turned around and gave us a housewarming gift,"
417,00:23:47.25,00:23:47.25,and it was a crate with two bottles of ice-cold champagne
418,00:23:49.46,00:23:49.46,in it. We don't even know
419,00:23:52.46,00:23:52.46,"if it was the alcohol, but it was the most delicious"
420,00:23:55.29,00:23:55.29,thing you ever tasted and it felt great.
421,00:23:58.46,00:23:58.46,I'm not that light yet. (giggling)
422,00:24:01.17,00:24:01.17,>> Caryn? (cackling)
423,00:24:11.08,00:24:11.08,>> I guess the other team won. >> I don't get it.
424,00:24:14.88,00:24:14.88,Damn. >> Probably just because
425,00:24:17.33,00:24:17.33,they haven't won one yet. >> No.
426,00:24:20.12,00:24:20.12,"That's B.S. >> Yeah, it is."
427,00:24:23.17,00:24:23.17,It seems that we lost the challenge.
428,00:24:26.04,00:24:26.04,"I was confident that we had it, you know?"
429,00:24:28.79,00:24:28.79,We worked hard. It looks good.
430,00:24:30.62,00:24:30.62,"It's a shame. But that's all right,"
431,00:24:33.12,00:24:33.12,'cause it just makes us more angry that we lost.
432,00:24:36.33,00:24:36.33,"We're ticked off, so we're going after them"
433,00:24:39.08,00:24:39.08,and we're going to run right them like a dang bulldozer.
434,00:24:42.21,00:24:42.21,"They won the first three times, it was their time."
435,00:24:45.12,00:24:45.12,It's our time now. >> Yo!
436,00:24:59.25,00:24:59.25,"We got tree mail. >> Oh, my God, it's"
437,00:25:07.12,00:25:07.12,a gladiator thing. We're going to have to hit
438,00:25:09.46,00:25:09.46,each other off beams. >> That's what I'm thinking.
439,00:25:11.33,00:25:11.33,">> ""Square off in a circle against your opponents."
440,00:25:13.08,00:25:13.08,Balance and strength: two crucial components.
441,00:25:16.00,00:25:16.00,David beat Goliath using brains over brawn.
442,00:25:19.08,00:25:19.08,"Be the one to lose this one, you could be the next gone."""
443,00:25:22.08,00:25:22.08,We're going to all have to take on one person with that.
444,00:25:24.96,00:25:24.96,">> Oh, yeah, that's what it's going to be."
445,00:25:26.21,00:25:26.21,>> I'm going to practice a little bit.
446,00:25:28.88,00:25:28.88,"I hate for things to come down to the wire,"
447,00:25:30.25,00:25:30.25,but it seems like it has with us.
448,00:25:31.75,00:25:31.75,"I mean, this next immunity can make or break us."
449,00:25:34.08,00:25:34.08,"If we don't get it, we're down to five and they have nine."
450,00:25:36.79,00:25:36.79,We can't lose another tribe member.
451,00:25:38.33,00:25:38.33,>> We're going to be like wolverines.
452,00:25:40.58,00:25:40.58,>> All I know to do to win this next immunity challenge
453,00:25:42.92,00:25:42.92,"is just to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight."
454,00:25:44.62,00:25:44.62,That's all I know to do. You've got to block out the past
455,00:25:47.54,00:25:47.54,"and worry about right now. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
456,00:26:04.08,00:26:04.08,Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
457,00:26:06.04,00:26:06.04,">> Yes. >> Yes, sir."
458,00:26:07.25,00:26:07.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: First things first.
459,00:26:08.67,00:26:08.67,Katie... Immunity back up for grabs.
460,00:26:15.21,00:26:15.21,"For today's immunity challenge, tribe members will engage"
461,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,one-on-one in a sumo-style battle on a platform.
462,00:26:23.42,00:26:23.42,"Using large padded bags, you will attempt to knock"
463,00:26:26.92,00:26:26.92,your opponent off the platform. Two rules-- you got to keep two
464,00:26:31.33,00:26:31.33,hands on the bag at all times. You cannot use your feet
465,00:26:34.42,00:26:34.42,as a weapon. First tribe to six wins
466,00:26:36.75,00:26:36.75,"immunity. Koror, because you have"
467,00:26:38.50,00:26:38.50,"three extra members, you're sitting three people out."
468,00:26:41.25,00:26:41.25,"And because this is men versus men, women versus women,"
469,00:26:42.79,00:26:42.79,you have to sit out two men and one woman
470,00:26:45.58,00:26:45.58,to even up the tribes. Who's sitting out?
471,00:26:47.46,00:26:47.46,">> I am. >> PROBST: Ian, Katie, Willard,"
472,00:26:50.29,00:26:50.29,sit out. Everybody else runs.
473,00:26:52.29,00:26:52.29,Take your spots. Wait for my go.
474,00:26:55.08,00:26:55.08,"All right, first round, man versus man--"
475,00:26:58.25,00:26:58.25,it is Tom for Koror and Bobby Jon for Ulong.
476,00:27:01.17,00:27:01.17,">> Here we go, Bobby. >> Come on, Tom."
477,00:27:04.17,00:27:04.17,>> PROBST: Survivors ready. Go!

572,00:32:33.00,00:32:33.00,Koror. For the fourth time.
573,00:32:36.08,00:32:36.08,No Tribal Council tonight. Nobody going home for this
574,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,tribe-- staying strong at nine. Ulong-- nothing to say.
575,00:32:43.12,00:32:43.12,Four straight visits to Tribal Council.
576,00:32:45.08,00:32:45.08,This tribe of six will become five tonight.
577,00:32:47.79,00:32:47.79,Head on back to camp. >> I thought we would have
578,00:33:12.58,00:33:12.58,"it today. >> Me, too."
579,00:33:15.33,00:33:15.33,>> I didn't know Coby was that much stronger than James.
580,00:33:20.50,00:33:20.50,">> Feels terrible to have my butt whooped by a homosexual,"
581,00:33:24.42,00:33:24.42,"you know, but a lot of gay folks are strong, man."
582,00:33:27.96,00:33:27.96,"They all working out at the gym and all, you know."
583,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,Damn. >> We got our butts kicked
584,00:33:36.21,00:33:36.21,today. Imagine that.
585,00:33:37.96,00:33:37.96,That's what's been happening here lately.
586,00:33:39.38,00:33:39.38,"I personally got my butt whipped, and now we got to go"
587,00:33:42.17,00:33:42.17,to Council tonight and we got to vote somebody off.
588,00:33:44.29,00:33:44.29,">> I am so sick of losing, I don't know what to do."
589,00:33:48.12,00:33:48.12,I've never lost this bad my entire life.
590,00:33:51.21,00:33:51.21,I'm about to flip out. When we got back
591,00:33:53.88,00:33:53.88,"from the challenge, I was so mad and upset"
592,00:33:56.46,00:33:56.46,and embarrassed and just pissed because James lost it for
593,00:33:58.71,00:33:58.71,"all of us. We could have won immunity,"
594,00:34:00.75,00:34:00.75,"and there it was out of our hands again, four in a row."
595,00:34:03.33,00:34:03.33,We lost. I'm friggin' embarrassed.
596,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,>> Yeah. >> I'm mortified.
597,00:34:08.12,00:34:08.12,">> Well, at least we know that we're doing our part."
598,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,>> Right. >> We didn't fall off.
599,00:34:14.62,00:34:14.62,">> Angie and I, we did the best we could do."
600,00:34:17.38,00:34:17.38,"We won both our heats, so thank God for the women,"
601,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,"'cause the guys, they're getting their butts handed"
602,00:34:22.12,00:34:22.12,"to them. >> Hey, Kim."
603,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,">> What? >> Tonight, we ain't playing"
604,00:34:27.25,00:34:27.25,the game. We ain't even going
605,00:34:28.75,00:34:28.75,to talk about it. We're just gonna go write
606,00:34:30.88,00:34:30.88,"a name down, you know. We all know whose name's"
607,00:34:34.75,00:34:34.75,going down. >> I'm laying right here in
608,00:34:37.42,00:34:37.42,"the shade. >> Kim, she sits on her butt,"
609,00:34:41.17,00:34:41.17,"but that's it, you know. She don't do nothing."
610,00:34:43.83,00:34:43.83,"She might drink some coconut juice, you know."
611,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,"That's about the most work she will do, you know."
612,00:34:48.21,00:34:48.21,Come on. So she's gone.
613,00:34:50.92,00:34:50.92,">> James told me, don't talk about your vote."
614,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,"Like, if anybody else had said it, it would have been"
615,00:34:55.75,00:34:55.75,"fine, but ever since then, it just makes me cry."
616,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,">> If you get voted off, it's going to be three guys"
617,00:35:01.54,00:35:01.54,versus two girls. And they're just going to vote
618,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"the girls off, one-by-one. Kim, she knows she can be the"
619,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,next one to go. Everybody is completely
620,00:35:11.71,00:35:11.71,"fed up with her. But if we vote Kim out,"
621,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,"and three guys and two girls, Angie and I are in big trouble."
622,00:35:17.08,00:35:17.08,I don't even know what to do. >> Kick all the guys off.
623,00:35:24.25,00:35:24.25,I think the girls definitely see the value
624,00:35:27.04,00:35:27.04,"of us sticking together, and I would more than be"
625,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,willing to see some of these guys go because they aren't
626,00:35:32.83,00:35:32.83,"the greatest. >> It's a slam dunk for me, man."
627,00:35:40.12,00:35:40.12,"Kim, I just think she's not a very strong girl,"
628,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,so I just think it's smarter to vote off the weakest link.
629,00:35:47.54,00:35:47.54,"Way to go, man. >> They're just going to totally"
630,00:35:50.58,00:35:50.58,take us out. >> Yeah.
631,00:35:53.29,00:35:53.29,">> So what are we going to do? >> Well, I just feel like"
632,00:35:56.88,00:35:56.88,we need to take control. >> Me and Steph are definitely
633,00:35:59.29,00:35:59.29,talking about trying to vote trying to vote one of the guys
634,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"out instead of Kim. We'd have the upper hand,"
635,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,"but then again, we might just lose another immunity challenge"
636,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,"because she's not pulling her weight, so what's the lesser"
637,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,of two evils? Trying to keep somebody around
638,00:36:12.08,00:36:12.08,"and hope you may not get voted off, but if she helps us lose"
639,00:36:14.71,00:36:14.71,"it, then-- pfft!-- you know, somebody's going anyways."
640,00:36:18.62,00:36:18.62,>> The tide's never up this high-- what the hell?
641,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,>> It could go either way. I could go or one
642,00:36:27.46,00:36:27.46,of the guys could go because this is a group
643,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,that actually won't make final decisions till it's time
644,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,to pick up that pen and write down the name.
645,00:36:56.04,00:36:56.04,>> PROBST: I saved your seats for you from last time.
646,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,>> Appreciate it. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
647,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,"some of the facts. Seven challenges,"
648,00:37:05.00,00:37:05.00,"you've lost five of them. Steph, how frustrating is it"
649,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,for you to continue to get beat? >> It's so frustrating.
650,00:37:11.88,00:37:11.88,I feel like I've never lost this much in my life.
651,00:37:14.25,00:37:14.25,"Like, I don't know whether to scream, flip out, cry..."
652,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,"I mean, I feel like we are giving it our best and it's"
653,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,not enough. Or at least I know I am
654,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"and it's, it's killing me. >> PROBST: Angie?"
655,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,">> I was really, really upset we didn't win that reward"
656,00:37:27.71,00:37:27.71,"challenge for that shelter, and then, on top of it,"
657,00:37:32.17,00:37:32.17,"to lose, like, you know, the next immunity challenge."
658,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,"Oh, man, it's just devastating. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon, I don't"
659,00:37:38.58,00:37:38.58,think we've ever had a tribe lose this many in a row.
660,00:37:41.08,00:37:41.08,">> Right. Yeah, things aren't good."
661,00:37:42.75,00:37:42.75,"Yeah, we're, we're bad. Right now, we're down."
662,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,"Obviously, you know what? I'm not doing something right,"
663,00:37:47.29,00:37:47.29,"and I mean, I consider my head being on the chopping block,"
664,00:37:50.04,00:37:50.04,"if you want to know the truth, 'cause I have let our tribe"
665,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,"down in the challenges, and I know I have and there's no"
666,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,"excuse for that, bottom line. >> PROBST: Okay, tonight, we're"
667,00:37:57.12,00:37:57.12,going to talk about accountability.
668,00:37:58.29,00:37:58.29,It is time to get to the bottom of what is wrong with this
669,00:38:01.92,00:38:01.92,"tribe, starting with camp life. Kim."
670,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,Is there one person that goes fishing?
671,00:38:06.50,00:38:06.50,Two people? Does everybody do it?
672,00:38:07.96,00:38:07.96,">> We all go out, but it seems that Bobby Jon and James take"
673,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,the Hawaiian sling the most and go.
674,00:38:15.12,00:38:15.12,>> PROBST: When's the last time you went fishing?
675,00:38:16.88,00:38:16.88,>> We all go out together. We don't go into the water
676,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,and fish. >> PROBST: So what are you
677,00:38:20.50,00:38:20.50,doing? >> We sit on the boat.
678,00:38:23.21,00:38:23.21,">> PROBST: Well, how useful is that?"
679,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,">> I mean, Stephenie and I couldn't just row out there"
680,00:38:28.46,00:38:28.46,all the way into the deep blue and go fishing and turn
681,00:38:31.88,00:38:31.88,"around and row back in. I mean, you might have"
682,00:38:34.25,00:38:34.25,"to send a search team out. >> PROBST: Steph, if you had no"
683,00:38:36.71,00:38:36.71,"men in this tribe, could you guys survive?"
684,00:38:38.42,00:38:38.42,Are you self-sufficient as women or are you relying
685,00:38:40.71,00:38:40.71,"on these guys? >> I think we rely on them,"
686,00:38:42.79,00:38:42.79,but I think we could be self-sufficient if we had to be.
687,00:38:45.96,00:38:45.96,>> I'm not sure if the guys think that us women are as
688,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,wieldy with things like the machete and axes and the spear.
689,00:38:52.83,00:38:52.83,"Like, when we were working on our reward"
690,00:38:55.21,00:38:55.21,"challenge, people were trying to help me nail-- now,"
691,00:38:58.12,00:38:58.12,"I nail a lot at home, okay? I know how to hammer a nail,"
692,00:39:01.88,00:39:01.88,it's not hard. But the guys think we're
693,00:39:04.04,00:39:04.04,a little bit more delicate than we really are.
694,00:39:06.21,00:39:06.21,>> PROBST: Bobby Jon. Is that fair to say?
695,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,">> You know, I've only been out here 11 days, and I've learned"
696,00:39:10.17,00:39:10.17,that these women right here are just as strong or more
697,00:39:12.58,00:39:12.58,stronger than men. If Kim can use that sling
698,00:39:16.08,00:39:16.08,"and go and kill us a bear, I mean, I want her to."
699,00:39:18.50,00:39:18.50,>> PROBST: Let's talk about today's challenge.
700,00:39:20.42,00:39:20.42,James. Frustrating to lose to Coby?
701,00:39:23.75,00:39:23.75,">> No doubt. I'm thinking, ""Man,"
702,00:39:25.67,00:39:25.67,he's a hairdresser. He don't look like he's
703,00:39:28.21,00:39:28.21,"got any muscle tone, I ought to be able to whoop him."""
704,00:39:31.29,00:39:31.29,"I tell you what, that boy right there has got some"
705,00:39:33.33,00:39:33.33,"ass behind him. >> PROBST: Well, of course"
706,00:39:35.62,00:39:35.62,you're going to say that... >> Whooped my ass! Yeah!
707,00:39:37.50,00:39:37.50,>> PROBST: Today it took six points to win.
708,00:39:40.21,00:39:40.21,Five of their six points came from beating the men.
709,00:39:44.04,00:39:44.04,The women carried this tribe again.
710,00:39:46.96,00:39:46.96,">> Yes, they did. >> PROBST: Kim, today you"
711,00:39:48.92,00:39:48.92,"may have lost, but as a whole, the women..."
712,00:39:52.29,00:39:52.29,>> Were stronger. >> PROBST: The women kept you
713,00:39:54.71,00:39:54.71,"guys in the challenge today. >> Yeah, definitely."
714,00:39:56.88,00:39:56.88,If we had had stronger guys with a burning passion
715,00:39:59.25,00:39:59.25,and control with that passion we would not be here right now.
716,00:40:03.08,00:40:03.08,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to vote."
717,00:40:05.33,00:40:05.33,"Ibrehem, you're up. >> Kim, you're a good girl, but"
718,00:40:19.25,00:40:19.25,you're just not putting much effort into the tribe lately.
719,00:40:22.08,00:40:22.08,Sorry. >> My vote is for James.
720,00:40:34.79,00:40:34.79,"James, just wary of dictating a little too much."
721,00:40:53.21,00:40:53.21,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
722,00:41:07.42,00:41:07.42,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
723,00:41:09.58,00:41:09.58,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
724,00:41:11.96,00:41:11.96,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
725,00:41:16.17,00:41:16.17,First vote. Kim.
726,00:41:21.33,00:41:21.33,"James. One vote Kim, one vote James."
727,00:41:29.46,00:41:29.46,Kim. Two votes Kim.
728,00:41:31.21,00:41:31.21,One vote James. Kim.
729,00:41:36.21,00:41:36.21,That's three votes Kim. Fourth person voted out
730,00:41:40.92,00:41:40.92,of Survivor: Palau-- Kim.
731,00:41:43.12,00:41:43.12,That's four. That's enough.
732,00:41:44.58,00:41:44.58,"You need to bring me your torch. >> Good luck, guys."
733,00:41:51.00,00:41:51.00,">> Bye, Kim. >> PROBST: Kim, the tribe has"
734,00:41:56.62,00:41:56.62,spoken. It's time for you to go.
735,00:42:11.00,00:42:11.00,"After a demoralizing first 11 days, the question is,"
736,00:42:13.54,00:42:13.54,what are you going to do to change the outcome?
737,00:42:17.08,00:42:17.08,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
738,00:42:33.25,00:42:33.25,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
739,00:42:40.12,00:42:40.12,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
740,00:42:42.29,00:42:42.29,While Gregg and Jen get cozy at Koror...
741,00:42:45.21,00:42:45.21,>> They're gonna think we're stupid if we can't tell
742,00:42:47.08,00:42:47.08,"that they're together. >> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
743,00:42:49.21,00:42:49.21,>> PROBST: ...the Ulong tribe gets lost.
744,00:42:51.12,00:42:51.12,>> Do you know the way to get back there?
745,00:42:53.12,00:42:53.12,>> No. >> I'm trying.
746,00:42:54.21,00:42:54.21,Don't get down my throat. >> PROBST: And the game takes
747,00:42:56.71,00:42:56.71,an incredible turn. >> I had a lot of fun
748,00:43:05.42,00:43:05.42,playing Survivor. I wish it had lasted quite a bit
749,00:43:08.25,00:43:08.25,"longer, but, unfortunately, I guess tonight was my night"
750,00:43:10.58,00:43:10.58,to go. I hope the girls really
751,00:43:13.75,00:43:13.75,"stick up for themselves, because Lord knows, the guys"
752,00:43:15.92,00:43:15.92,"have proven that they're nothing special on our tribe,"
753,00:43:19.71,00:43:19.71,"and I really hope that, in the end, somebody from Ulong wins,"
754,00:43:23.08,00:43:23.08,and not somebody from Koror.
