20,00:00:52.04,00:00:52.04,>> That thing right there.It's coming closer.
21,00:00:54.21,00:00:54.21,This is probably the stupidestthing I've done in a while.
22,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,>> It's a game of survival andwe're going to get a shark.
23,00:00:59.21,00:00:59.21,">> Okay, here comes one.>> PROBST: Before the immunity"
24,00:01:03.08,00:01:03.08,"challenge, Ulong faced a setbackwhen Jeff sprained his ankle."
25,00:01:07.25,00:01:07.25,>> It's totally my luck.I hurt my ankle and we have
26,00:01:09.58,00:01:09.58,a challenge the very nextmorning.

30,00:01:20.71,00:01:20.71,"a long test of strength andendurance, it was Koror who"
31,00:01:23.04,00:01:23.04,pulled through.Koror wins their third immunity
32,00:01:27.67,00:01:27.67,challenge in a row.>> Whoo!
33,00:01:30.96,00:01:30.96,">> PROBST: Back at camp,Jeff gathered his tribe."
34,00:01:33.83,00:01:33.83,I know there's no possible waythat I can get to the end
35,00:01:36.08,00:01:36.08,"with a busted-up ankle.If I stay in here, you guys"
36,00:01:38.71,00:01:38.71,aren't going to get to the end.>> PROBST: Some were not
37,00:01:41.04,00:01:41.04,convinced.>> I feel very strongly
38,00:01:42.75,00:01:42.75,that Jeff should stay.We should get rid of Kim
39,00:01:45.12,00:01:45.12,for sure.>> PROBST: But at Tribal
40,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,"Council, Kim was spared whenthe tribe honored Jeff's"
41,00:01:51.04,00:01:51.04,"wishes and voted him out.Jeff, the tribe has spoken."
42,00:01:55.79,00:01:55.79,15 are left.Who will be voted out tonight?
43,00:03:26.46,00:03:26.46,>> I can't believe this is allthat's left.
44,00:03:29.00,00:03:29.00,"We started out with,like, so many people."
45,00:03:35.46,00:03:35.46,">> I know.>> Tonight at Tribal Council,"
46,00:03:39.12,00:03:39.12,Jeff went home.I am very sad he's not here.
47,00:03:42.54,00:03:42.54,He's great for the team.He's a great friend.
48,00:03:44.58,00:03:44.58,It absolutely is horrible tolose the strongest player on
49,00:03:48.21,00:03:48.21,"your tribe, but that's whathe had wanted, and so that's"
50,00:03:52.12,00:03:52.12,what we did.>> Koror is using strategy when
51,00:03:55.88,00:03:55.88,it comes to the immunitychallenge.
52,00:03:58.33,00:03:58.33,">> Yeah, but they're aweak-ass team."
53,00:04:00.25,00:04:00.25,There's obviously somethinggoing wrong because they're
54,00:04:03.08,00:04:03.08,not in shape and they'rekicking our asses.
55,00:04:05.21,00:04:05.21,>> We're not going to Tribalagain.
56,00:04:06.75,00:04:06.75,You guys understand me?I'm going to stomp
57,00:04:09.83,00:04:09.83,anybody's ass that lags.You know what I mean.
58,00:04:15.21,00:04:15.21,">> He means it in a good way,though."
59,00:04:18.29,00:04:18.29,>> I don't know.This tribe right now doesn't
60,00:04:19.96,00:04:19.96,"have a lot of togetherness.and closeness, like we thought"
61,00:04:21.71,00:04:21.71,"we had.As it's built right now,"
62,00:04:24.04,00:04:24.04,"everybody's self-esteem'sgetting down, but I'm hoping"
63,00:04:26.25,00:04:26.25,"we're going to turn it around.I hope we do learn something,"
64,00:04:30.08,00:04:30.08,"but right now, I don't thinkwe have."
65,00:04:47.12,00:04:47.12,>> Tree mail.Uh...
66,00:04:51.50,00:04:51.50,">> I knew it.>> ""Today you must choose one"
67,00:04:54.29,00:04:54.29,and only one tribalrepresentative to make some
68,00:04:56.88,00:04:56.88,important choices.The tribe will then have to
69,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,"live with those decisions."">> Katie and I went to go get"
70,00:05:02.58,00:05:02.58,tree mail this morning and itbasically says the we need
71,00:05:05.42,00:05:05.42,"to send a tribal representativeout, and that we have to live"
72,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,with the decisions that we make.>> We need to figure out
73,00:05:11.62,00:05:11.62,what it is.It could be a person swap.
74,00:05:13.75,00:05:13.75,">> Yeah, or what if the persongoes doesn't get to come back?"
75,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,">> I think Gregg should go.>> I'm not crazy about it,"
76,00:05:24.38,00:05:24.38,but I'm not opposed to it.>> Everyone else is up for it?
77,00:05:29.21,00:05:29.21,>> I am.>> I would definitely be willing
78,00:05:31.46,00:05:31.46,to go.>> I would do it.
79,00:05:34.12,00:05:34.12,>> I would do it.>> I'll speak right out
80,00:05:36.83,00:05:36.83,"on that and do a vote.Ian, you've made many good"
81,00:05:39.12,00:05:39.12,"decisions, you've been theteam leader here."
82,00:05:42.62,00:05:42.62,You want to go?I say you go.
83,00:05:44.08,00:05:44.08,">> Yeah, he'd be good.>> Today we were volunteering"
84,00:05:47.21,00:05:47.21,"on who wanted to go, me,Caryn and Janu all volunteered."
85,00:05:51.42,00:05:51.42,But it's like nobody listenedto us.
86,00:05:53.00,00:05:53.00,"They just said, ""So, should itbe Gregg or should be it Ian?"""
87,00:05:55.54,00:05:55.54,"""I want to go.""""Well, should it be Gregg"
88,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,"or should it be Ian?""""I want to go,"" I just kept"
89,00:06:01.12,00:06:01.12,repeating myself.>> I just don't want to lose
90,00:06:02.54,00:06:02.54,you.>> I'll be back.
91,00:06:03.42,00:06:03.42,We'll see each other again.Is that cool?
92,00:06:06.04,00:06:06.04,>> It's definitelythe tribe's vote.
93,00:06:07.04,00:06:07.04,Everybody seems to go for Ian.I'm not going to fight for it.
94,00:06:09.62,00:06:09.62,"By picking the team leader,the separation of the group"
95,00:06:12.58,00:06:12.58,"is just obvious.Katie, Jennifer, Gregg, Ian"
96,00:06:14.29,00:06:14.29,"and Tom are one unit,so that makes five against four."
97,00:06:19.42,00:06:19.42,"Once we saw them all bandtogether, it was obvious that"
98,00:06:22.71,00:06:22.71,we're definitely theunderdogs here.
99,00:06:30.88,00:06:30.88,">> ""Today you must choose oneand only one."""
100,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,>> So somebody is going to bethe top dog here.

102,00:06:40.21,00:06:40.21,hat.>> How do you feel about
103,00:06:44.88,00:06:44.88,"doing it, Kim?>> I'm fine with it."
104,00:06:47.71,00:06:47.71,"I think you're good at it,too, though."
105,00:06:51.50,00:06:51.50,>> Maybe we'll draw strawsor something.
106,00:06:55.12,00:06:55.12,>> I don't know.I don't agree with the
107,00:06:59.04,00:06:59.04,drawing straws.It seems like nobody likes
108,00:07:01.04,00:07:01.04,to sit down and think about itfor a second.
109,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,"It's very impulsive, and I'msure that it won't be the best"
110,00:07:07.54,00:07:07.54,decision once it's made.>> Want to see what the
111,00:07:10.38,00:07:10.38,challenge is and then go fromthere?
112,00:07:12.21,00:07:12.21,>> Yeah.We have to go fishing right now.
113,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00,"Let's go.>> Yeah, let's do that."
114,00:07:15.46,00:07:15.46,>> Let's go fishing.>> There's a boat coming.
115,00:07:36.75,00:07:36.75,>> This is like some kindof World War II thing.
116,00:07:39.04,00:07:39.04,">> It's on its way.>> Oh, look at it."
117,00:07:43.29,00:07:43.29,">> PROBST: What's going on,Koror?"
118,00:07:45.42,00:07:45.42,>> Hey.>> PROBST: Who's the

128,00:08:17.12,00:08:17.12,that excited to see tools?>> PROBST: A few items.
129,00:08:19.04,00:08:19.04,"You have a bush shower,a shower curtain, some rings,"
130,00:08:23.21,00:08:23.21,"toilet seat, some twine, wire,rope, lots of nails, right?"

136,00:08:42.25,00:08:42.25,his toolbox.It was a difficult decision.
137,00:08:44.25,00:08:44.25,But my dad ownsa construction company and I
138,00:08:46.08,00:08:46.08,"grew up on a farm, so itworked out okay."

591,00:33:56.46,00:33:56.46,and embarrassed and just pissedbecause James lost it for
592,00:33:58.71,00:33:58.71,"all of us.We could have won immunity,"
593,00:34:00.75,00:34:00.75,"and there it was out of ourhands again, four in a row."

600,00:34:20.21,00:34:20.21,"'cause the guys, they'regetting their butts handed"
601,00:34:22.12,00:34:22.12,"to them.>> Hey, Kim."
602,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,">> What?>> Tonight, we ain't playing"
603,00:34:27.25,00:34:27.25,the game.We ain't even going
604,00:34:28.75,00:34:28.75,to talk about it.We're just gonna go write
605,00:34:30.88,00:34:30.88,"a name down, you know.We all know whose name's"
606,00:34:34.75,00:34:34.75,going down.>> I'm laying right here in
607,00:34:37.42,00:34:37.42,"the shade.>> Kim, she sits on her butt,"
608,00:34:41.17,00:34:41.17,"but that's it, you know.She don't do nothing."
609,00:34:43.83,00:34:43.83,"She might drink somecoconut juice, you know."
610,00:34:45.75,00:34:45.75,"That's about the most workshe will do, you know."
611,00:34:48.21,00:34:48.21,Come on.So she's gone.
612,00:34:50.92,00:34:50.92,">> James told me, don't talkabout your vote."
613,00:34:53.29,00:34:53.29,"Like, if anybody else hadsaid it, it would have been"
614,00:34:55.75,00:34:55.75,"fine, but ever since then,it just makes me cry."
615,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,">> If you get voted off,it's going to be three guys"
616,00:35:01.54,00:35:01.54,versus two girls.And they're just going to vote
617,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"the girls off, one-by-one.Kim, she knows she can be the"
618,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,next one to go.Everybody is completely
619,00:35:11.71,00:35:11.71,"fed up with her.But if we vote Kim out,"
620,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,"and three guys and two girls,Angie and I are in big trouble."
621,00:35:17.08,00:35:17.08,I don't even know what to do.>> Kick all the guys off.
622,00:35:24.25,00:35:24.25,I think the girlsdefinitely see the value
623,00:35:27.04,00:35:27.04,"of us sticking together,and I would more than be"
624,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,willing to see some of theseguys go because they aren't
625,00:35:32.83,00:35:32.83,"the greatest.>> It's a slam dunk for me, man."
626,00:35:40.12,00:35:40.12,"Kim, I just think she'snot a very strong girl,"
627,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,so I just think it's smarterto vote off the weakest link.
628,00:35:47.54,00:35:47.54,"Way to go, man.>> They're just going to totally"
629,00:35:50.58,00:35:50.58,take us out.>> Yeah.
630,00:35:53.29,00:35:53.29,">> So what are we going to do?>> Well, I just feel like"
631,00:35:56.88,00:35:56.88,we need to take control.>> Me and Steph are definitely
632,00:35:59.29,00:35:59.29,talking about trying to votetrying to vote one of the guys
633,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"out instead of Kim.We'd have the upper hand,"
634,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,"but then again, we might justlose another immunity challenge"
635,00:36:07.21,00:36:07.21,"because she's not pullingher weight, so what's the lesser"
636,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,of two evils?Trying to keep somebody around
637,00:36:12.08,00:36:12.08,"and hope you may not get votedoff, but if she helps us lose"
638,00:36:14.71,00:36:14.71,"it, then-- pfft!-- you know,somebody's going anyways."
639,00:36:18.62,00:36:18.62,>> The tide's never up thishigh-- what the hell?
640,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,>> It could go either way.I could go or one
641,00:36:27.46,00:36:27.46,of the guys could gobecause this is a group
642,00:36:29.83,00:36:29.83,that actually won't makefinal decisions till it's time
643,00:36:32.21,00:36:32.21,to pick up that pen and writedown the name.

648,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,for you to continue to get beat?>> It's so frustrating.
649,00:37:11.88,00:37:11.88,I feel like I've never lostthis much in my life.
650,00:37:14.25,00:37:14.25,"Like, I don't know whetherto scream, flip out, cry..."
651,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,"I mean, I feel like we aregiving it our best and it's"
652,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,not enough.Or at least I know I am
653,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"and it's, it's killing me.>> PROBST: Angie?"
654,00:37:24.67,00:37:24.67,">> I was really, really upsetwe didn't win that reward"
655,00:37:27.71,00:37:27.71,"challenge for that shelter,and then, on top of it,"
656,00:37:32.17,00:37:32.17,"to lose, like, you know,the next immunity challenge."
657,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,"Oh, man, it's just devastating.>> PROBST: Bobby Jon, I don't"

661,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,"Obviously, you know what?I'm not doing something right,"
662,00:37:47.29,00:37:47.29,"and I mean, I consider my headbeing on the chopping block,"
663,00:37:50.04,00:37:50.04,"if you want to know the truth,'cause I have let our tribe"

687,00:38:50.04,00:38:50.04,wieldy with things like themachete and axes and the spear.
