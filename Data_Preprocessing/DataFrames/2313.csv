895,00:29:00.50,00:29:00.50,STICKS HIS FREAKING SMELLY FOOT
896,00:29:02.70,00:29:02.70,IN HIS MOUTH AND GET IN TROUBLE.
897,00:29:04.30,00:29:04.30,I'M NOT GOING TO LET THIS MAKE
898,00:29:05.70,00:29:05.70,ME DOWN.
899,00:29:06.30,00:29:06.30,IF SHE WANTS TO PUT ME AS HER

914,00:29:48.00,00:29:48.00,AND BRANDON OPENED HIS MOUTH.
915,00:29:49.53,00:29:49.53,HE WAS REALLY RUDE TO EDNA.
916,00:29:51.20,00:29:51.20,THERE WAS NO REASON TO TELL HER
917,00:29:53.77,00:29:53.77,"""WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET YOU"
918,00:29:55.27,00:29:55.27,"OUT."""
919,00:29:55.43,00:29:55.43,"I MEAN, THAT'S A BULLYING THING"
920,00:29:57.40,00:29:57.40,TO DO.
921,00:29:57.73,00:29:57.73,DO YOU BOYS NEED SOME WATER
922,00:30:01.73,00:30:01.73,FILTERED?
923,00:30:02.50,00:30:02.50,"WHY DO YOU GOT TO DO THAT,"
924,00:30:05.10,00:30:05.10,BRANDON?
925,00:30:05.27,00:30:05.27,AND I LIKE EDNA.
926,00:30:06.30,00:30:06.30,IT DIDN'T NEED TO HAPPEN.
927,00:30:07.40,00:30:07.40,SHE WAS CLEARLY NOT GOING TO WIN
928,00:30:08.50,00:30:08.50,THE GAME SO WHY KICK HER IN THE
929,00:30:10.80,00:30:10.80,"GUTS LIKE A LITTLE DOG, CALLING"
930,00:30:12.57,00:30:12.57,"A DOG OVER, COME HERE, COME"
931,00:30:14.27,00:30:14.27,"HERE, COME HERE, AND WHACK IT IN"
932,00:30:15.53,00:30:15.53,THE GUT WITH YOUR FOOT.
933,00:30:16.67,00:30:16.67,"YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT RIGHT."
934,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,"EDNA, I JUST WANTED TO LET"
935,00:30:19.63,00:30:19.63,"YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE"
936,00:30:21.30,00:30:21.30,YOU FEEL BAD OR ANYTHING.
937,00:30:22.33,00:30:22.33,"WELL, YOU DID."
938,00:30:23.43,00:30:23.43,DID I REALLY?
939,00:30:24.43,00:30:24.43,"YES, I WAS ABOUT TO CRY."
940,00:30:26.07,00:30:26.07,I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO CRY
941,00:30:27.77,00:30:27.77,NOW.
942,00:30:27.93,00:30:27.93,"WELL, YOU KNOW ME IN ANY"
943,00:30:30.53,00:30:30.53,"SITUATION, I'M VERY TRANSPARENT"
944,00:30:32.10,00:30:32.10,WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
945,00:30:33.60,00:30:33.60,HOPEFULLY YOU RESPECT THAT.
946,00:30:34.73,00:30:34.73,I DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM.
947,00:30:37.07,00:30:37.07,I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE WE
948,00:30:38.53,00:30:38.53,SAYING SOMEONE'S NAME.
949,00:30:39.30,00:30:39.30,THE FACT THAT YOU EVEN
950,00:30:41.00,00:30:41.00,BROUGHT IT UP IS A LITTLE BIT
951,00:30:42.40,00:30:42.40,UNNECESSARY TO MENTION.
952,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,I THINK.
953,00:30:44.37,00:30:44.37,ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M SORRY
954,00:30:46.43,00:30:46.43,AND I HOPE YOU ACCEPT MY
955,00:30:47.83,00:30:47.83,APOLOGY.
956,00:30:48.00,00:30:48.00,"I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, IT'S"
957,00:30:50.07,00:30:50.07,"LIKE YOU ALREADY DID IT, SO."
958,00:30:52.50,00:30:52.50,I UNDERSTAND.
959,00:30:53.97,00:30:53.97,I ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY
960,00:30:56.23,00:30:56.23,ACTION.
961,00:30:56.40,00:30:56.40,BRANDON DID VERBALIZE AN
962,00:30:58.70,00:30:58.70,APOLOGY BUT IT'S INSIGNE TEAR.
963,00:31:00.57,00:31:00.57,IT'S LIKE BEATING YOUR WIFE.
964,00:31:02.60,00:31:02.60,AND THEN APPROXIMATIONING OR
965,00:31:03.87,00:31:03.87,BUYING HER A DIAMOND NECKLACE.
966,00:31:05.93,00:31:05.93,I BOUGHT HER A DIAMOND NECKLACE.
967,00:31:08.03,00:31:08.03,"I APOLOGIZED, AND THAT'S IT."
968,00:31:09.63,00:31:09.63,"IN HIS MIND, IT'S LIKE OKAY, SHE"
969,00:31:14.23,00:31:14.23,APOLOGIZED.
970,00:31:14.47,00:31:14.47,LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
971,00:31:16.10,00:31:16.10,INSULT.
972,00:31:16.27,00:31:16.27,"BRENDAN, I THINK, OFTEN"
973,00:31:19.03,00:31:19.03,THINKS HIS APOLOGY ABSOLVES ALL
974,00:31:21.53,00:31:21.53,SIN.
975,00:31:21.70,00:31:21.70,MAYBE THAT'S TRUE IN CHURCH BUT
976,00:31:22.80,00:31:22.80,"ON ""SURVIVOR"" PEOPLE ARE NOT AS"
977,00:31:25.67,00:31:25.67,"FORGIVING, YOU KNOW, AS JESUS"
978,00:31:26.87,00:31:26.87,CHRIST IS.
979,00:31:27.47,00:31:27.47,AND EDNA IS NOT AS FORGIVING AND
980,00:31:29.23,00:31:29.23,THE REST OF THE TRIBE-- IT
981,00:31:32.10,00:31:32.10,DIDN'T GO UNNOTICED WITH US.
982,00:31:38.53,00:31:38.53,I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU
983,00:31:41.10,00:31:41.10,ALL.
984,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,"OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO SAVE MY OWN"
985,00:31:43.90,00:31:43.90,HIDE AND LIVE ANOTHER DAY IN
986,00:31:45.20,00:31:45.20,THIS GAME.
987,00:31:45.83,00:31:45.83,MY CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW IS AT THE
988,00:31:47.73,00:31:47.73,EXPENSE OF BRANDON.
989,00:31:51.33,00:31:51.33,WE'VE BEEN PREACHING THAT OUR
990,00:31:52.43,00:31:52.43,"TRIBE IS ABOUT HONOR, INTEGRITY,"
991,00:31:55.10,00:31:55.10,AND PLAYING THIS LIKE IT'S REAL
992,00:31:56.70,00:31:56.70,LIFE.
993,00:31:57.40,00:31:57.40,AND I FEEL AS THO THE ACTIONS OF
994,00:32:00.20,00:32:00.20,BRANDON IN THE LAST 32 DAYS
995,00:32:03.93,00:32:03.93,DON'T-- AREN'T REALLY CONSISTENT
996,00:32:04.93,00:32:04.93,WITH THAT.
997,00:32:05.93,00:32:05.93,"IT'S DAY 32, AND I ASK YOU TO"
998,00:32:08.00,00:32:08.00,DEFINE WHAT HONOR AND INTEGRITY
999,00:32:09.93,00:32:09.93,IS.
1000,00:32:10.20,00:32:10.20,DOES IT INCLUDE LYING TO YOUR
1001,00:32:12.53,00:32:12.53,OTHER TRIBE MATES?
1002,00:32:13.63,00:32:13.63,DOES IT INCLUDE ALL THESE
1003,00:32:15.10,00:32:15.10,EMOTIONAL OUTBREAKS?
1004,00:32:16.47,00:32:16.47,I JUST ASK YOU TO JUXTAPOSE
1005,00:32:18.90,00:32:18.90,AGAINST THE WAY I PERFORMED IN
1006,00:32:20.60,00:32:20.60,THIS GAME.
1007,00:32:21.23,00:32:21.23,I JUST CANNOT ACCEPT THE FACT
1008,00:32:22.93,00:32:22.93,THAT OUR TRIBE SAYS HONOR AND
1009,00:32:24.93,00:32:24.93,INTEGRITY AND HONOR AND
1010,00:32:25.63,00:32:25.63,INTEGRITY AND THEN YOU ALLOW
1011,00:32:26.90,00:32:26.90,SUCH BEHAVIOR TO HAPPEN IN OUR
1012,00:32:28.23,00:32:28.23,CAMP.
1013,00:32:28.40,00:32:28.40,THAT IS ALMOST A HALL PASS FOR
1014,00:32:30.27,00:32:30.27,HIM TO ACT IRRATIONALLY AROUND
1015,00:32:32.07,00:32:32.07,CAMP AND EMOTIONALLY DESTRUCTIVE
1016,00:32:33.53,00:32:33.53,"TO EVERYBODY AROUND US-- ME,"
1017,00:32:36.07,00:32:36.07,"MIKAYLA, YOU GUYS, WHEN YOU GUYS"

1024,00:32:46.57,00:32:46.57,HERE.
1025,00:32:46.73,00:32:46.73,EDNA PROVOCATIVELY PUT
1026,00:32:51.30,00:32:51.30,SOMETHING ON THE TABLE.
1027,00:32:52.00,00:32:52.00,"VOTE OUT BRANDON TONIGHT, KEEP"
1028,00:32:53.77,00:32:53.77,"ME, AND THE FOUR OF US WILL TAKE"
1029,00:32:56.20,00:32:56.20,OWNERSHIP OF THIS GAME.
1030,00:32:58.67,00:32:58.67,SYSTEMATICALLY SHE JUST LAID IT
1031,00:32:59.63,00:32:59.63,ALL THE OUT FOR US.
1032,00:33:01.20,00:33:01.20,IF THERE'S ANY ARGUMENT FOR US
1033,00:33:02.43,00:33:02.43,TO SEND SOMEBODY ELSE HOME
1034,00:33:04.53,00:33:04.53,"TONIGHT, SHE SERVED BRANDON UP"
1035,00:33:08.10,00:33:08.10,VO-PITCH STYLE.
1036,00:33:09.20,00:33:09.20,A PITCH WE CAN KNOCK OUT OF THE
1037,00:33:12.23,00:33:12.23,PARK.
1038,00:33:12.40,00:33:12.40,ON A DAY WE DEFINITELY THOUGHT
1039,00:33:13.87,00:33:13.87,"EDNA WAS GOING TO GO HOME,"
1040,00:33:15.23,00:33:15.23,THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.
1041,00:33:16.40,00:33:16.40,"ALL RIGHT, GIVE IT TO ME"
1042,00:33:19.47,00:33:19.47,STRAIGHT.
1043,00:33:23.37,00:33:23.37,YOU TAKE AN INDEPENDENT JURY.
1044,00:33:25.20,00:33:25.20,AND YOU PUT EDNA ON THE STAND
1045,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,AND YOU PUT BRENDAN ON THE
1046,00:33:30.57,00:33:30.57,STABBED.
1047,00:33:30.80,00:33:30.80,WHO WILL BE CONVICTED GUILTY?
1048,00:33:32.53,00:33:32.53,BRANDON.
1049,00:33:32.77,00:33:32.77,WHO IS MORE DESERVING OF
1050,00:33:35.20,00:33:35.20,STAYING?
1051,00:33:35.80,00:33:35.80,IDNA.
1052,00:33:36.27,00:33:36.27,ABSOLUTELY.
1053,00:33:36.43,00:33:36.43,THEY DON'T WANT TO SEND BRANDON
1054,00:33:38.37,00:33:38.37,"TO REDEMPTION, HAVE HIM WIN AND"
1055,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90,COME BACK.
1056,00:33:40.93,00:33:40.93,THAT'S FINE AND GOOD AND
1057,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,EVERYTHING.
1058,00:33:43.43,00:33:43.43,IT'S JUST-- I HAVE TO ASK THIS
1059,00:33:45.67,00:33:45.67,QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY
1060,00:33:46.77,00:33:46.77,AN OPTION.
1061,00:33:48.30,00:33:48.30,WOULD YOU BE-- I HAVE TO ASK IT
1062,00:33:52.97,00:33:52.97,BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY AN
1063,00:33:54.07,00:33:54.07,OPTION.
1064,00:33:54.30,00:33:54.30,WILL YOU PLAY YOUR IDOL FOR ME?
1065,00:33:55.77,00:33:55.77,NO.
1066,00:33:56.23,00:33:56.23,WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS FOR
1067,00:33:57.63,00:33:57.63,THE IDOL.
1068,00:33:58.20,00:33:58.20,WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL USE IT?

1152,00:36:47.97,00:36:47.97,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO TARGET

1162,00:37:09.63,00:37:09.63,DEVIATES MOST FROM OUR MANTRA.
1163,00:37:12.63,00:37:12.63,"FROM THE FIRST TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
1164,00:37:14.53,00:37:14.53,HE PLOTTED A LIE THAT INVOLVED

1199,00:38:05.83,00:38:05.83,PERSONALLY.
1200,00:38:06.03,00:38:06.03,I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY OPEN

1207,00:38:12.33,00:38:12.33,AND AFTER HEARING THE THINGS

1209,00:38:15.47,00:38:15.47,MY FEELINGS A LOT BECAUSE I'VE
1210,00:38:16.93,00:38:16.93,NEVER HAD A NEGATIVE THING TO

1212,00:38:20.83,00:38:20.83,THAT SHE'S RUNNING AROUND THE
1213,00:38:22.00,00:38:22.00,TRIBE AND PLANTING SEEDS IN
1214,00:38:24.07,00:38:24.07,PEOPLE'S MINDS.
1215,00:38:24.70,00:38:24.70,Jeff: EDNA--
1216,00:38:25.83,00:38:25.83,"TO CLARIFY, I WASN'T PLANTING"
1217,00:38:28.10,00:38:28.10,SEEDS.
1218,00:38:28.27,00:38:28.27,I AM NOT FABRICATING THE EVENTS

1226,00:38:41.70,00:38:41.70,NOW THAT YOU ARE WITH A GROUP OF
1227,00:38:44.03,00:38:44.03,PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN
1228,00:38:45.40,00:38:45.40,TOGETHER FOR 32 DAYS?
1229,00:38:46.17,00:38:46.17,RIGHT.

1236,00:38:55.60,00:38:55.60,I THINK TODAY IS THAT DAY THAT
1237,00:38:57.43,00:38:57.43,IT'S ENDING.

1242,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

1244,00:39:06.60,00:39:06.60,"BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT CORE,"
1245,00:39:08.57,00:39:08.57,IT ALWAYS STARTS TO GET THINNER
1246,00:39:09.67,00:39:09.67,AND THINNER THE DEEPER GO INTO
