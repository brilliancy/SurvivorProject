914,00:29:49.53,00:29:49.53,HE WAS REALLY RUDE TO EDNA.
915,00:29:51.20,00:29:51.20,THERE WAS NO REASON TO TELL HER
916,00:29:53.77,00:29:53.77,"""WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET YOU"
917,00:29:55.27,00:29:55.27,"OUT."""

923,00:30:05.10,00:30:05.10,BRANDON?
924,00:30:05.27,00:30:05.27,AND I LIKE EDNA.
925,00:30:06.30,00:30:06.30,IT DIDN'T NEED TO HAPPEN.
926,00:30:07.40,00:30:07.40,SHE WAS CLEARLY NOT GOING TOWIN
927,00:30:08.50,00:30:08.50,THE GAME SO WHY KICK HER IN THE

931,00:30:15.53,00:30:15.53,THE GUT WITH YOUR FOOT.
932,00:30:16.67,00:30:16.67,"YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT RIGHT."
933,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,"EDNA, I JUST WANTED TO LET"
934,00:30:19.63,00:30:19.63,"YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE"
935,00:30:21.30,00:30:21.30,YOU FEEL BAD OR ANYTHING.
936,00:30:22.33,00:30:22.33,"WELL, YOU DID."
937,00:30:23.43,00:30:23.43,DID I REALLY?
938,00:30:24.43,00:30:24.43,"YES, I WAS ABOUT TO CRY."
939,00:30:26.07,00:30:26.07,I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO CRY
940,00:30:27.77,00:30:27.77,NOW.
941,00:30:27.93,00:30:27.93,"WELL, YOU KNOW ME IN ANY"
942,00:30:30.53,00:30:30.53,"SITUATION, I'M VERY TRANSPARENT"

944,00:30:33.60,00:30:33.60,HOPEFULLY YOU RESPECT THAT.
945,00:30:34.73,00:30:34.73,I DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM.
946,00:30:37.07,00:30:37.07,I DIDN'T WANT TO BE RUDE WE
947,00:30:38.53,00:30:38.53,SAYING SOMEONE'S NAME.
948,00:30:39.30,00:30:39.30,THE FACT THAT YOU EVEN
949,00:30:41.00,00:30:41.00,BROUGHT IT UP IS A LITTLE BIT
950,00:30:42.40,00:30:42.40,UNNECESSARY TO MENTION.
951,00:30:43.37,00:30:43.37,I THINK.
952,00:30:44.37,00:30:44.37,ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M SORRY
953,00:30:46.43,00:30:46.43,AND I HOPE YOU ACCEPT MY
954,00:30:47.83,00:30:47.83,APOLOGY.
955,00:30:48.00,00:30:48.00,"I MEAN, AT THIS POINT, IT'S"
956,00:30:50.07,00:30:50.07,"LIKE YOU ALREADY DID IT, SO."
957,00:30:52.50,00:30:52.50,I UNDERSTAND.
958,00:30:53.97,00:30:53.97,I ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES OF MY
959,00:30:56.23,00:30:56.23,ACTION.
960,00:30:56.40,00:30:56.40,BRANDON DID VERBALIZE AN
961,00:30:58.70,00:30:58.70,APOLOGY BUT IT'S INSIGNE TEAR.
962,00:31:00.57,00:31:00.57,IT'S LIKE BEATING YOUR WIFE.
963,00:31:02.60,00:31:02.60,AND THEN APPROXIMATIONING OR
964,00:31:03.87,00:31:03.87,BUYING HER A DIAMOND NECKLACE.
965,00:31:05.93,00:31:05.93,I BOUGHT HER A DIAMONDNECKLACE.
966,00:31:08.03,00:31:08.03,"I APOLOGIZED, AND THAT'S IT."
967,00:31:09.63,00:31:09.63,"IN HIS MIND, IT'S LIKE OKAY,SHE"
968,00:31:14.23,00:31:14.23,APOLOGIZED.
969,00:31:14.47,00:31:14.47,LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
970,00:31:16.10,00:31:16.10,INSULT.
971,00:31:16.27,00:31:16.27,"BRENDAN, I THINK, OFTEN"
972,00:31:19.03,00:31:19.03,THINKS HIS APOLOGY ABSOLVES ALL
973,00:31:21.53,00:31:21.53,SIN.
974,00:31:21.70,00:31:21.70,MAYBE THAT'S TRUE IN CHURCH BUT
975,00:31:22.80,00:31:22.80,"ON ""SURVIVOR"" PEOPLE ARE NOT AS"
976,00:31:25.67,00:31:25.67,"FORGIVING, YOU KNOW, AS JESUS"
977,00:31:26.87,00:31:26.87,CHRIST IS.
978,00:31:27.47,00:31:27.47,AND EDNA IS NOT AS FORGIVINGAND
979,00:31:29.23,00:31:29.23,THE REST OF THE TRIBE-- IT
980,00:31:32.10,00:31:32.10,DIDN'T GO UNNOTICED WITH US.
981,00:31:38.53,00:31:38.53,I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU
982,00:31:41.10,00:31:41.10,ALL.
983,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,"OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO SAVE MYOWN"
984,00:31:43.90,00:31:43.90,HIDE AND LIVE ANOTHER DAY IN
985,00:31:45.20,00:31:45.20,THIS GAME.
986,00:31:45.83,00:31:45.83,MY CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW IS AT THE
987,00:31:47.73,00:31:47.73,EXPENSE OF BRANDON.
988,00:31:51.33,00:31:51.33,WE'VE BEEN PREACHING THAT OUR

990,00:31:55.10,00:31:55.10,AND PLAYING THIS LIKE IT'S REAL
991,00:31:56.70,00:31:56.70,LIFE.
992,00:31:57.40,00:31:57.40,AND I FEEL AS THO THE ACTIONSOF
993,00:32:00.20,00:32:00.20,BRANDON IN THE LAST 32 DAYS
994,00:32:03.93,00:32:03.93,DON'T-- AREN'T REALLYCONSISTENT
995,00:32:04.93,00:32:04.93,WITH THAT.
996,00:32:05.93,00:32:05.93,"IT'S DAY 32, AND I ASK YOU TO"
997,00:32:08.00,00:32:08.00,DEFINE WHAT HONOR AND INTEGRITY
998,00:32:09.93,00:32:09.93,IS.
999,00:32:10.20,00:32:10.20,DOES IT INCLUDE LYING TO YOUR
1000,00:32:12.53,00:32:12.53,OTHER TRIBE MATES?
1001,00:32:13.63,00:32:13.63,DOES IT INCLUDE ALL THESE
1002,00:32:15.10,00:32:15.10,EMOTIONAL OUTBREAKS?
1003,00:32:16.47,00:32:16.47,I JUST ASK YOU TO JUXTAPOSE

1006,00:32:21.23,00:32:21.23,I JUST CANNOT ACCEPT THE FACT
1007,00:32:22.93,00:32:22.93,THAT OUR TRIBE SAYS HONOR AND
1008,00:32:24.93,00:32:24.93,INTEGRITY AND HONOR AND
1009,00:32:25.63,00:32:25.63,INTEGRITY AND THEN YOU ALLOW

1012,00:32:28.40,00:32:28.40,THAT IS ALMOST A HALL PASS FOR
1013,00:32:30.27,00:32:30.27,HIM TO ACT IRRATIONALLY AROUND
1014,00:32:32.07,00:32:32.07,CAMP AND EMOTIONALLYDESTRUCTIVE

1037,00:33:12.40,00:33:12.40,ON A DAY WE DEFINITELY THOUGHT
1038,00:33:13.87,00:33:13.87,"EDNA WAS GOING TO GO HOME,"
1039,00:33:15.23,00:33:15.23,THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.

1052,00:33:36.43,00:33:36.43,THEY DON'T WANT TO SEND BRANDON
1053,00:33:38.37,00:33:38.37,"TO REDEMPTION, HAVE HIM WIN AND"
1054,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90,COME BACK.
