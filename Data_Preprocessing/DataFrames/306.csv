1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:00.47,00:00:00.47,- (Jeff Probst) Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:02.93,00:00:02.93,All bets were off when the game took a drastic twist.
4,00:00:05.50,00:00:05.50,"Silas, Teresa, Frank, you guys are now members of Boran."
5,00:00:08.17,00:00:08.17,"Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys are now members of Samburu."
6,00:00:11.27,00:00:11.27,"- No, what?"
7,00:00:12.33,00:00:12.33,"- (Probst) At Samburu, Lindsey,"
8,00:00:13.77,00:00:13.77,Brandon and Kim were shocked to meet their new tribe mates.
9,00:00:16.57,00:00:16.57,"- I'm just, like..."
10,00:00:17.57,00:00:17.57,"- (Probst) At Boran, Ethan, Kim"
11,00:00:19.07,00:00:19.07,and Clarence had the same surprise.
12,00:00:21.23,00:00:21.23,"- Hey, you got a nice holster."
13,00:00:22.50,00:00:22.50,- I'm definitely on the other side right now.
14,00:00:24.30,00:00:24.30,"I was on the good side, now I'm on the bad side."
15,00:00:26.00,00:00:26.00,"- Frank and I looked at each other and thought, ""You know..."""
16,00:00:28.10,00:00:28.10,- We're alive again.
17,00:00:29.63,00:00:29.63,- (Probst) Boran won three egg-laying chickens
18,00:00:32.93,00:00:32.93,and a rooster at the reward challenge.
19,00:00:34.70,00:00:34.70,Boran wins!
20,00:00:35.73,00:00:35.73,- Boran!
21,00:00:37.10,00:00:37.10,- (Probst) But Samburu won the immunity challenge...
22,00:00:39.07,00:00:39.07,(cheering)
23,00:00:41.47,00:00:41.47,"...sending Boran to Tribal Council,"
24,00:00:42.83,00:00:42.83,where Silas was voted out of the tribe.
25,00:00:46.40,00:00:46.40,"Well, there's been a lot of assumptions made by you"
26,00:00:48.27,00:00:48.27,guys so far in this game.
27,00:00:50.33,00:00:50.33,One of them is that in three days there will be a merge.
28,00:00:54.40,00:00:54.40,11 are left.
29,00:00:55.40,00:00:55.40,"Tonight, one more will go."
30,00:00:59.87,00:00:59.87,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
31,00:01:59.37,00:01:59.37,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
32,00:02:12.63,00:02:12.63,(clucking)
33,00:02:17.57,00:02:17.57,"- You know, during our questioning, Jeff's, like,"
34,00:02:19.27,00:02:19.27,"""Ethan, with this merger coming up,"
35,00:02:21.33,00:02:21.33,"are you vulnerable getting voted off?"""
36,00:02:23.27,00:02:23.27,So the merger is coming up.
37,00:02:24.80,00:02:24.80,"- My gut feeling would be, if the merger was changed from the"
38,00:02:28.00,00:02:28.00,"norm, that it would be sooner rather than later."
39,00:02:30.83,00:02:30.83,"- Well, I think either way,"
40,00:02:32.33,00:02:32.33,beginning tomorrow morning we're just going to have to be ready
41,00:02:34.27,00:02:34.27,for whatever comes.
42,00:02:35.37,00:02:35.37,- Right.
43,00:02:37.00,00:02:37.00,- The whole thing with the merge is driving me insane.
44,00:02:39.23,00:02:39.23,"At the end of Tribal Council the other night, Jeff said,"
45,00:02:41.60,00:02:41.60,"""You guys assume the merge is in three days."""
46,00:02:45.67,00:02:45.67,"So, you know, he throws the question out there."
47,00:02:47.43,00:02:47.43,He throws the thought out there.
48,00:02:49.57,00:02:49.57,"Put it in our head that, like, oh, my God, maybe the merge"
49,00:02:51.20,00:02:51.20, isn't in three days.
50,00:02:53.57,00:02:53.57,We rationed our food so we're ending all our food at
51,00:02:55.83,00:02:55.83,"the merger, which is in three days."
52,00:02:57.50,00:02:57.50,If we eat all our food and there's no merger after three
53,00:02:59.70,00:02:59.70,"days, we have no food."
54,00:03:01.63,00:03:01.63,- We have three chickens.
55,00:03:03.57,00:03:03.57,"- We need to decide, do we stay"
56,00:03:05.17,00:03:05.17,"with our normal food intake, do we ration?"
57,00:03:08.17,00:03:08.17,"I mean, how do you guys want to proceed?"
58,00:03:10.13,00:03:10.13,- We prepare for the worst.
59,00:03:10.13,00:03:10.13,- Yeah.
60,00:03:11.67,00:03:11.67,"- I mean, what happens if it's in ten days?"
61,00:03:13.37,00:03:13.37,We're screwed.
62,00:03:28.23,00:03:28.23,(crickets chirping)
63,00:03:31.20,00:03:31.20,- I got another hour before daylight.
64,00:03:32.73,00:03:32.73,- Mm-hmm.
65,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57,"- (whispers) We got, like, five-hour watch."
66,00:03:43.67,00:03:43.67,I think we came out about 1:00 in the morning.
67,00:03:47.13,00:03:47.13,Tom and I took in a long night shift last night.
68,00:03:49.67,00:03:49.67,"Everyone else took about an hour and a half, two hours, and we"
69,00:03:52.47,00:03:52.47,"got, like... we got stuck with about five hours."
70,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93,We've been staying up all night for over two weeks.
71,00:03:56.93,00:03:56.93,These guys have no concept of what a three-hour shift is.
72,00:04:00.57,00:04:00.57,They just throw a log on the fire and go to bed.
73,00:04:02.93,00:04:02.93,- That sucks.
74,00:04:04.13,00:04:04.13,"- I know, it's terrible,"
75,00:04:05.40,00:04:05.40,but she just does not want to do it at all.
76,00:04:08.10,00:04:08.10,- I think Lindsey's heart is in the right place.
77,00:04:10.77,00:04:10.77,"- Oh, yeah, she's a sweet girl."
78,00:04:12.50,00:04:12.50,- She's just a big...
79,00:04:15.57,00:04:15.57,- It was painfully obvious the moment we stepped foot in camp
80,00:04:18.43,00:04:18.43,"here that, you know, we had three people here that..."
81,00:04:20.70,00:04:20.70,they were here for a little resort vacation.
82,00:04:23.43,00:04:23.43,They weren't here to do anything
83,00:04:25.03,00:04:25.03,but nap and eat and make a couple meals.
84,00:04:27.50,00:04:27.50,- How was your guys' last shift?
85,00:04:28.77,00:04:28.77,"Was it too long, too short?"
86,00:04:30.40,00:04:30.40,- It was at least five hours.
87,00:04:31.47,00:04:31.47,"- Was it, really?"
88,00:04:35.13,00:04:35.13,Everyone is stressed out right now.
89,00:04:36.80,00:04:36.80,This whole switcheroo thing has made
90,00:04:38.47,00:04:38.47,everyone's mind kind of go crazy.
91,00:04:40.47,00:04:40.47,"Everyone is thinking, ""Oh, we're two new tribes now."
92,00:04:42.23,00:04:42.23,"Let's not think of our old tribes."""
93,00:04:43.37,00:04:43.37,"But it's inevitable,"
94,00:04:44.47,00:04:44.47,you're going to think of your old tribe.
95,00:04:45.87,00:04:45.87,- I want to know who the hell got the boot.
96,00:04:48.13,00:04:48.13,- Frank is a target.
97,00:04:49.30,00:04:49.30,- I think everyone will vote for him.
98,00:04:52.63,00:04:52.63,- I hope so.
99,00:04:54.20,00:04:54.20,"- People just want to see what's shaking up at Boran,"
100,00:04:56.67,00:04:56.67,because what goes on over there could totally affect
101,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,what happens over here.
102,00:05:00.53,00:05:00.53,- What do you think?
103,00:05:01.83,00:05:01.83,- I'm concerned that Kim may have gotten canned.
104,00:05:04.93,00:05:04.93,"- We know if we get beat in a challenge, we've got our vote,"
105,00:05:08.27,00:05:08.27,and we know it's going to be three-three.
106,00:05:10.80,00:05:10.80,"They're going to pick out somebody on us, and we're going"
107,00:05:13.03,00:05:13.03,to pick out somebody on them.
108,00:05:15.30,00:05:15.30,But the key to the vote is what's happened before.
109,00:05:19.60,00:05:19.60,"- If we have to go to Tribal Council,"
110,00:05:21.67,00:05:21.67,it's all about past votes.
111,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90,"If we have a tie, it comes down to who has more votes, then I"
112,00:05:27.13,00:05:27.13,"already have four votes against me, so I'd be gone."
113,00:05:30.70,00:05:30.70,- Three more nights y'all have got with us.
114,00:05:32.63,00:05:32.63,"- God, I'm glad we got you guys."
115,00:05:33.97,00:05:33.97,"- Yeah, we lucked out, we did really, really well."
116,00:05:35.87,00:05:35.87,"- I'm really trying to save my own butt, you know?"
117,00:05:38.13,00:05:38.13,I don't want them to have any clue about my situation.
118,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,"I mean, I set a goal for myself, and I am the kind of person that"
119,00:05:44.30,00:05:44.30,"when I set a goal, I'm going to achieve it."
120,00:06:01.63,00:06:01.63,- I can't stop thinking about food.
121,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,I dream about food.
122,00:06:05.73,00:06:05.73,I think about food when I'm eating food.
123,00:06:07.33,00:06:07.33,I think about food 24/7.
124,00:06:10.50,00:06:10.50,Any eggs yet?
125,00:06:10.50,00:06:10.50,- No.
126,00:06:12.60,00:06:12.60,"- Ah, you know what that means-- chopping-block day."
127,00:06:15.90,00:06:15.90,"- Since we got those chickens,"
128,00:06:17.40,00:06:17.40,we'll have to keep an eye on you.
129,00:06:18.47,00:06:18.47,"Every time you walk by the cage,"
130,00:06:20.53,00:06:20.53,we'll have to keep an eye on you.
131,00:06:21.60,00:06:21.60,- I will not deny that I'm
132,00:06:22.90,00:06:22.90,having homicidal feelings about those damn chickens.
133,00:06:25.37,00:06:25.37,- What do you guys think?
134,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00,What do you and Kim think about the chicken situation?
135,00:06:29.10,00:06:29.10,- I don't know.
136,00:06:30.20,00:06:30.20,"I mean, you just want to eat them?"
137,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,- I'd rather have eggs.
138,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,"- Yeah, me, too."
139,00:06:34.63,00:06:34.63,- For some reason I don't know that that's going to happen.
140,00:06:37.53,00:06:37.53,- Yeah.
141,00:06:38.93,00:06:38.93,"Some people want to eat the chickens right away,"
142,00:06:40.90,00:06:40.90,"like Clarence, and some people want to wait"
143,00:06:44.10,00:06:44.10,to see if they'll lay some eggs.
144,00:06:45.70,00:06:45.70,"It's just, the problem is, if we go to the merger and we're not"
145,00:06:47.80,00:06:47.80,"allowed to take the chickens, then it's a waste."
146,00:06:51.77,00:06:51.77,- Chicken nuggets.
147,00:06:53.87,00:06:53.87,"- Clarence, are they acting like they're thinking about"
148,00:06:55.73,00:06:55.73,laying eggs?
149,00:06:56.93,00:06:56.93,"- Hell, no."
150,00:06:59.37,00:06:59.37,I'm breaking straw for your little asses.
151,00:07:01.27,00:07:01.27,Lay some eggs.
152,00:07:03.60,00:07:03.60,"- The chickens are presently still up for debate, but we're"
153,00:07:06.53,00:07:06.53,going to wait till today's reward challenge to see
154,00:07:08.80,00:07:08.80,what's available today and then probably
155,00:07:10.57,00:07:10.57,make a decision tonight.
156,00:07:17.87,00:07:17.87,"- Whatever it is, I hope there's no animals."
157,00:07:20.27,00:07:20.27,"No goats, chickens."
158,00:07:22.27,00:07:22.27,The only animal I want is something that's going to be on
159,00:07:24.87,00:07:24.87,"a plate, that I could eat."
160,00:07:27.27,00:07:27.27,"That's all I want, just food."
161,00:07:28.67,00:07:28.67,- Good old food.
162,00:07:31.37,00:07:31.37,"- Yep, there is mail."
163,00:07:34.87,00:07:34.87,You ready?
164,00:07:35.87,00:07:35.87,- Yeah.
165,00:07:37.63,00:07:37.63,"- ""Stick with your tribe."
166,00:07:39.10,00:07:39.10,"""Make your way to the bottom."
167,00:07:41.07,00:07:41.07,"""Just give us your answers, that is, if you got 'em."
168,00:07:44.80,00:07:44.80,"""You must work as a team, confer with your bunch."
169,00:07:47.53,00:07:47.53,"Make a wrong move and watch the others eat lunch."""
170,00:07:50.03,00:07:50.03,"- Oh, that's good."
171,00:07:51.50,00:07:51.50,"- The reward they said is ""lunch,"" so the food-- maybe,"
172,00:07:54.57,00:07:54.57,"we'll go someplace, and have a"
173,00:07:56.00,00:07:56.00,nice sit-down lunch-slash-dinner.
174,00:07:58.43,00:07:58.43,"- ""Make your way to the bottom."""
175,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97,That's the clue in there.
176,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97,"- Maybe it's, like, a giant board game or something."
177,00:08:03.80,00:08:03.80,- How comfortable are you guys with all the stuff in the book?
178,00:08:06.23,00:08:06.23,Pretty good with all that?
179,00:08:07.43,00:08:07.43,Today's tree mail indicates
180,00:08:08.77,00:08:08.77,that it's probably something sort of cerebral.
181,00:08:11.47,00:08:11.47,We've been studying all the things we learned in our
182,00:08:13.47,00:08:13.47,"survival manual-- the desert out here, and the plants and"
183,00:08:16.03,00:08:16.03,the animals-- hoping that we can win us a free lunch.
184,00:08:27.77,00:08:27.77,"- Silas is gone, Silas is gone."
185,00:08:32.37,00:08:32.37,"Oh, my God."
186,00:08:36.10,00:08:36.10,"- (Probst) Hey, guys."
187,00:08:37.13,00:08:37.13,"Samburu, getting your first look"
188,00:08:38.87,00:08:38.87,at the latest member of Boran to be voted out.
189,00:08:41.87,00:08:41.87,Silas is gone.
190,00:08:43.10,00:08:43.10,Reactions? Surprised?
191,00:08:44.27,00:08:44.27,- Uh-uh.
192,00:08:44.27,00:08:44.27,- No.
193,00:08:45.87,00:08:45.87,- No... no.
194,00:08:47.33,00:08:47.33,"- All right, today for your reward challenge, I'm going"
195,00:08:50.77,00:08:50.77,"to ask you a series of questions about Africa, and you'll answer"
196,00:08:54.77,00:08:54.77,each question as a tribe.
197,00:08:56.80,00:08:56.80,"Each time you get one right, you move one step down on"
198,00:08:59.63,00:08:59.63,"the bleacher, one step closer to the finish."
199,00:09:01.63,00:09:01.63,First tribe to reach the finish gets the reward.
200,00:09:05.23,00:09:05.23,Want to know what you're playing for?
201,00:09:07.07,00:09:07.07,"- Yes, sir."
202,00:09:08.70,00:09:08.70,- Oh...

369,00:15:09.73,00:15:09.73,I was definitely shocked.

371,00:15:13.37,00:15:13.37,would think it would come down three and three.
372,00:15:15.00,00:15:15.00,- You know why Silas has votes against him?
373,00:15:16.43,00:15:16.43,'cause Frank tried to get Silas in an alliance
374,00:15:17.60,00:15:17.60,and Silas said no.
375,00:15:17.60,00:15:17.60,- Really.
376,00:15:19.60,00:15:19.60,- So Frank went ballistic.

383,00:15:35.80,00:15:35.80,And I think they were definitely out for some kind of revenge.
384,00:15:38.00,00:15:38.00,"- Frank must have totally sold out Silas, 'cause there's no way"
385,00:15:39.77,00:15:39.77,they would have known to vote for him.
386,00:15:41.20,00:15:41.20,"- Oh, yeah, that's exac-- that's what I mean."
387,00:15:42.60,00:15:42.60,- What a little pig.
388,00:15:44.10,00:15:44.10,- I told Lindsey that probably was a big part of them switching

390,00:15:49.80,00:15:49.80,"have to really think about it, if they're backed into a corner."
391,00:15:52.77,00:15:52.77,Looks to me like we're the ones kind of over the pit now.
392,00:16:04.60,00:16:04.60,"- I think for the rest of my life,"
393,00:16:05.63,00:16:05.63,I want to be a food critic.

408,00:16:38.03,00:16:38.03,"We'll get an egg or two, hopefully."
409,00:16:40.73,00:16:40.73,"- The members of my tribe, they're of the opinion that"
410,00:16:43.00,00:16:43.00,"given the right environment, our chickens are going to lay eggs,"
411,00:16:46.90,00:16:46.90,which is completely... a joke to me.
412,00:16:51.33,00:16:51.33,(chickens clucking)
413,00:16:54.27,00:16:54.27,"- Believe it or not, I think we're all unsure what the hens"
414,00:16:57.23,00:16:57.23,need to do to lay the eggs.
415,00:16:58.63,00:16:58.63,Frank wants to put a net out there
416,00:16:59.97,00:16:59.97,so they can run around and play.
417,00:17:03.20,00:17:03.20,(quiet laugh)
418,00:17:06.80,00:17:06.80,"- Oh, giving you something nice."
419,00:17:10.30,00:17:10.30,"I think that's better for them, don't you?"
420,00:17:11.97,00:17:11.97,- One of you say your good-byes.
421,00:17:14.07,00:17:14.07,"Don't get mad. Don't get mad, man."
422,00:17:15.73,00:17:15.73,"- Oh, she's telling you."
423,00:17:16.83,00:17:16.83,- Don't get mad.
424,00:17:17.87,00:17:17.87,Tribal Council for you tonight.
425,00:17:20.37,00:17:20.37,"- As much as we're joking about it,"
426,00:17:21.70,00:17:21.70,I am serious about killing one of those chickens.
427,00:17:23.73,00:17:23.73,(knife scraping)
428,00:17:28.07,00:17:28.07,"You know, I've talked to each one of the chickens personally,"
429,00:17:32.00,00:17:32.00,"and I've informed them that, you know, they're on notice."
430,00:17:34.80,00:17:34.80,- Last night you told them you loved them and...
431,00:17:37.13,00:17:37.13,"- I do, man. I also told them, you know, you got 24 hours to"
432,00:17:40.27,00:17:40.27,"lay an egg, and now technically,"
433,00:17:41.93,00:17:41.93,"it'll be 48 hours, so that's on them."
434,00:17:44.53,00:17:44.53,- What if they lay an egg by tomorrow morning?
435,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,- Then we spare them. How's that?
436,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,- Really?
437,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,- I swear.
438,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,"- You hear that, you guys?"
439,00:17:50.40,00:17:50.40,"Clarence says if we find an egg in the morning,"
440,00:17:52.37,00:17:52.37,the chicken lives.
441,00:17:54.27,00:17:54.27,"- All they have to do is lay an egg, one egg."
442,00:18:06.90,00:18:06.90,"- I mean, we don't know what's happened over there."
443,00:18:10.10,00:18:10.10,"I mean, we have no idea, like, they have no idea that all"
444,00:18:12.00,00:18:12.00,of us are over here totally getting along.
445,00:18:13.50,00:18:13.50,"- Yeah, that's true."
446,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,- I'm kind of loving it.
447,00:18:16.03,00:18:16.03,I kind of think it's cool.
448,00:18:18.67,00:18:18.67,- I've had some moments with Kelly that I feel like we've
449,00:18:20.77,00:18:20.77,"sort of bonded and we've had a good time, and she has expressed"
450,00:18:23.73,00:18:23.73,"that she's fearful of her demise, so..."
451,00:18:27.03,00:18:27.03,She seems pretty genuine.
452,00:18:29.20,00:18:29.20,- (whispers) I think Kelly really likes her.
453,00:18:31.70,00:18:31.70,- I think they really like all three of us.
454,00:18:33.73,00:18:33.73,But that has nothing to do with it.
455,00:18:36.17,00:18:36.17,We cannot vote for Lindsey.
456,00:18:38.33,00:18:38.33,"If she gets voted against, I'm gone in the next six days."
457,00:18:41.40,00:18:41.40,And that's the same with you.
458,00:18:43.77,00:18:43.77,And that's not good enough.
459,00:18:45.73,00:18:45.73,"- If we have to go to a Tribal Council, we're assuming that it"
460,00:18:48.30,00:18:48.30,will go to a tiebreaker and
461,00:18:49.83,00:18:49.83,they'll ask us questions from this handbook.
462,00:18:51.37,00:18:51.37,- Which is what they did the last time.
463,00:18:52.90,00:18:52.90,- Which is what they did the last time.
464,00:18:54.57,00:18:54.57,"- But, see, you're not, I mean, you don't see the big picture."
465,00:18:56.40,00:18:56.40,They are not... they are not going to vote for you.
466,00:18:59.97,00:18:59.97,"They like you more than me, 'cause I have haven't been"
467,00:19:02.10,00:19:02.10,trying to be all that extra nice to them.
468,00:19:04.40,00:19:04.40,I just haven't.
469,00:19:05.77,00:19:05.77,"I mean, I don't care."
470,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,(rooster crowing)
471,00:19:17.00,00:19:17.00,(chickens clucking)
472,00:19:26.93,00:19:26.93,"- Good morning, boys and girls."
473,00:19:29.97,00:19:29.97,Did you guys leave us any eggs?
474,00:19:31.90,00:19:31.90,(chickens clucking)
475,00:19:33.23,00:19:33.23,"I went into the cage this morning, and I didn't see"
476,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,"anything in the beginning at all, and I thought, ""Oh, damn,"
477,00:19:38.27,00:19:38.27,"these chickens didn't lay any eggs again."""
478,00:19:46.37,00:19:46.37,(quietly) Yay. Look at this.
479,00:19:49.13,00:19:49.13,"Look at this, you guys. Yay."
480,00:19:51.63,00:19:51.63,"Yes, yes."
481,00:19:53.47,00:19:53.47,"Yes, we have eggs."
482,00:19:54.97,00:19:54.97,"- Oh, don't tell..."
483,00:19:56.90,00:19:56.90,She's got something in her hand.
484,00:19:57.97,00:19:57.97,- (whistling a tune)
485,00:19:59.03,00:19:59.03,- I'll be damned.
486,00:20:01.33,00:20:01.33,"Look at that, see?"
487,00:20:02.77,00:20:02.77,"You've got an egg, right?"
488,00:20:06.47,00:20:06.47,"Oh, yeah!"
489,00:20:08.63,00:20:08.63,Great.
490,00:20:09.63,00:20:09.63,- Isn't that cool?
491,00:20:10.97,00:20:10.97,Let's just put it right there.
492,00:20:12.50,00:20:12.50,- Just let it sit there.
493,00:20:15.23,00:20:15.23,- So we're just going to keep it right on the tray there until
494,00:20:17.70,00:20:17.70,Clarence wakes up and sees the egg.
495,00:20:19.83,00:20:19.83,"(imitates Clarence) Oh, damn!"
496,00:20:21.30,00:20:21.30,"Damn, those chickens."
497,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,We finally have an egg.
498,00:20:24.60,00:20:24.60,- I loved it this morning when Kim brought over that egg.
499,00:20:27.67,00:20:27.67,"'cause last night Clarence was, like, ""Well, one of them have an"
500,00:20:30.47,00:20:30.47,"egg, we don't have to eat the chicken."""
501,00:20:35.70,00:20:35.70,- An egg!
502,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,- Shh.
503,00:20:41.03,00:20:41.03,- (whispers) Wow!
504,00:20:42.03,00:20:42.03,- Shh. He's coming.
505,00:20:48.23,00:20:48.23,- What's up?
506,00:20:50.13,00:20:50.13,"- What's up, Clarence?"
507,00:20:54.20,00:20:54.20,"- Aw, hell, no! Come on!"
508,00:20:56.37,00:20:56.37,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
509,00:20:58.13,00:20:58.13,"(whooping, cheering)"
510,00:21:01.40,00:21:01.40,- No chicken for you!
511,00:21:03.03,00:21:03.03,- I hate you and you and you
512,00:21:05.63,00:21:05.63,"and you, and you did it just to spite me, so whatever."
513,00:21:09.20,00:21:09.20,"And you laid... and they laid the smallest egg possible, too."
514,00:21:11.10,00:21:11.10,(laughter)
515,00:21:13.73,00:21:13.73,"If you scramble that egg, it might disappear."
516,00:21:16.07,00:21:16.07,(laughter)
517,00:21:18.37,00:21:18.37,"Oh, I hate those chickens."
518,00:21:19.80,00:21:19.80,"- Truth is, I don't think any"
519,00:21:20.93,00:21:20.93,of us mind killing a chicken for dinner.
520,00:21:22.63,00:21:22.63,"- We tormented him a little bit, but we decided we were"
521,00:21:26.27,00:21:26.27,going to kill a chicken and eat it for dinner anyway.
522,00:21:37.27,00:21:37.27,- You can come to my house
523,00:21:38.37,00:21:38.37,and carve a Thanksgiving turkey anytime.
524,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,- Wow.
525,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,- Mmm.
526,00:21:42.87,00:21:42.87,"- Oh, my God."
527,00:21:44.17,00:21:44.17,The chicken tastes great.
528,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,"Everyone had a hand in preparing it, and, I mean, I was just,"
529,00:21:49.27,00:21:49.27,"wow, it was just... mwah!"
530,00:21:52.03,00:21:52.03,- Oh.
531,00:21:53.43,00:21:53.43,(chuckling)
532,00:21:54.83,00:21:54.83,"- Oh, God."
533,00:21:55.87,00:21:55.87,- Okay. Well...
534,00:21:55.87,00:21:55.87,- Wow.
535,00:21:57.47,00:21:57.47,- How good is that?
536,00:21:58.50,00:21:58.50,- Mmm.
537,00:21:59.97,00:21:59.97,"- Since our arrival, Teresa and I, we've been smiling."
538,00:22:03.83,00:22:03.83,It's been a very comfortable transition.
539,00:22:05.73,00:22:05.73,"Thank you, everyone."
540,00:22:06.87,00:22:06.87,"You know, I wish we would have"
541,00:22:08.10,00:22:08.10,been here from day one with these people.
542,00:22:09.67,00:22:09.67,"- Y'all, that was very delicious."
543,00:22:15.27,00:22:15.27,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
544,00:22:32.63,00:22:32.63,- (whispering) That makes sense.
545,00:22:34.10,00:22:34.10,"I can't believe I never thought of that, why Kim was doing it."
546,00:22:36.93,00:22:36.93,"- No, I didn't know she was doing this."
547,00:22:39.30,00:22:39.30,- She did it at the...
548,00:22:40.67,00:22:40.67,- All I saw her do is this.
549,00:22:42.37,00:22:42.37,"- She did that yesterday, too."
550,00:22:44.03,00:22:44.03,- I'm such an idiot.
551,00:22:45.87,00:22:45.87,"All this time, Kim, at the challenges, she was doing this."
552,00:22:48.03,00:22:48.03,"I'm, like, what does this mean, lose?"
553,00:22:49.43,00:22:49.43,Do you want me to throw the challenge?
554,00:22:51.13,00:22:51.13,What's the L? The L?
555,00:22:52.70,00:22:52.70,"Then I'm sitting there, and I'm, like, ""Oh, Lindsey."""
556,00:22:55.50,00:22:55.50,"Obviously, she thinks Lindsey has votes against her."
557,00:22:57.97,00:22:57.97,And also I think she was trying to tell me Brandon.
558,00:23:00.67,00:23:00.67,"Because if she was doing something like this, I don't"
559,00:23:02.47,00:23:02.47,"know, I think it's ""B"" in sign language."
560,00:23:03.90,00:23:03.90,She knows sign language. I don't know it.
561,00:23:05.40,00:23:05.40,"- They were totally communicating,"
562,00:23:07.30,00:23:07.30,"and I was like... ""What's going on?"""
563,00:23:09.73,00:23:09.73,And she kept going...
564,00:23:13.60,00:23:13.60,- They were trying to tell them something.
565,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,"I don't know if it was, you know, vote for Lindsey,"
566,00:23:18.27,00:23:18.27,"she has votes, or... I don't know."
567,00:23:28.70,00:23:28.70,- I... I think we need to go
568,00:23:30.53,00:23:30.53,"with the safest bet, as we've said all along."
569,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,"- I mean, we're playing hard ball now."
570,00:23:34.53,00:23:34.53,"- Yeah, that's true."
571,00:23:36.97,00:23:36.97,- We're pretty sure that
572,00:23:38.10,00:23:38.10,Brandon already has votes against him.
573,00:23:40.07,00:23:40.07,We suspected that from the start.
574,00:23:41.73,00:23:41.73,"Knowing that Frank had been in the same tribe with him,"
575,00:23:43.80,00:23:43.80,we figured if there was anybody that Frank was just going to
576,00:23:46.37,00:23:46.37,throw a vote at just on
577,00:23:47.90,00:23:47.90,"principal alone, it would have been Brandon."
578,00:23:53.30,00:23:53.30,"- I don't know what they're thinking, but I don't have any"
579,00:23:55.83,00:23:55.83,"votes, so I still think I have a really good chance."
580,00:23:58.90,00:23:58.90,"But if they vote for Lindsey, then it's done, she's gone."
581,00:24:01.97,00:24:01.97,"Out of the three of us, they're gonna be most likely to think"
582,00:24:04.37,00:24:04.37,"that I have a vote from Frank, you know what I mean?"
583,00:24:06.53,00:24:06.53,"- That's why they think they're sitting pretty, it's because"
584,00:24:08.60,00:24:08.60,they assume that you have a vote.
585,00:24:09.93,00:24:09.93,- They just assume that I have a vote from Frank.
586,00:24:11.40,00:24:11.40,- Should we just vote for Tom and stick to it?
587,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,- We stick with it.
588,00:24:14.23,00:24:14.23,"That's it, period."
589,00:24:17.50,00:24:17.50,- (loud snoring)
590,00:24:20.43,00:24:20.43,- We're totally confident that if it's a three-and-three tie
591,00:24:22.67,00:24:22.67,"against Brandon and Tom, that Brandon can win the questions."
592,00:24:25.97,00:24:25.97,- (groaning)
593,00:24:29.70,00:24:29.70,"- I mean, Kelly, she's like a walking thesaurus, and Lex"
594,00:24:32.23,00:24:32.23,"probably is too much of a chance, too."
595,00:24:35.20,00:24:35.20,"So we think we're going to vote for Tom, knowing that Brandon"
596,00:24:38.33,00:24:38.33,could probably beat him in trivia.
597,00:24:39.97,00:24:39.97,"- I'm going to do it, there's just no way around it."
598,00:24:42.17,00:24:42.17,"There's no way I can lose to him, unless it's..."
599,00:24:44.60,00:24:44.60,I can't imagine what question they would ask that he would
600,00:24:46.30,00:24:46.30,know and I wouldn't.
601,00:24:47.73,00:24:47.73,"I mean, I told the girls this is what we would do."
602,00:24:49.90,00:24:49.90,I'll have to just take a bullet for her.
603,00:24:51.93,00:24:51.93,Let's have a group hug.
604,00:24:54.07,00:24:54.07,Come here.
605,00:25:01.07,00:25:01.07,"- It looks like they're still a little divided, so it probably"
606,00:25:03.30,00:25:03.30,will be a three-three vote on their side.
607,00:25:05.20,00:25:05.20,- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
608,00:25:06.60,00:25:06.60,- And hopefully they got the clue that Lindsey has four
609,00:25:09.07,00:25:09.07,"votes, and they'll vote her."
610,00:25:11.27,00:25:11.27,- Yeah.
611,00:25:18.53,00:25:18.53,"- Oh, yes!"
612,00:25:21.03,00:25:21.03,"- (both) ""To bring home the bounty, the key is to aim."
613,00:25:25.13,00:25:25.13,"""If you can't hit the mark, there's no one to blame."
614,00:25:29.07,00:25:29.07,"""It may seem so easy, but lest ye confuse,"
615,00:25:33.33,00:25:33.33,"the last tribe to do it will pick one to lose."""
616,00:25:36.20,00:25:36.20,- So everyone's got to do it.
617,00:25:37.23,00:25:37.23,- Yep.
618,00:25:38.80,00:25:38.80,"- So Frank can teach us all how to do it, which is good."
619,00:25:41.30,00:25:41.30,"- Oh, that's right, he's a hunter."
620,00:25:42.83,00:25:42.83,"- You know, immediately they read the mail, and it was going"
621,00:25:45.83,00:25:45.83,to take a team effort by all of us.
622,00:25:47.57,00:25:47.57,"So being what I consider proficient somewhat in archery,"
623,00:25:51.10,00:25:51.10,I was immediately thrust right into the limelight.
624,00:25:54.13,00:25:54.13,"Okay, T, here's the line, right here."
625,00:25:56.57,00:25:56.57,Point your left foot right at the target.
626,00:25:58.37,00:25:58.37,Got it?
627,00:25:59.43,00:25:59.43,"Index finger on top, let it seep."
628,00:26:01.90,00:26:01.90,"Lean a little forward, draw back, and hold that form until"
629,00:26:05.67,00:26:05.67,the arrow hits the ground.
630,00:26:08.37,00:26:08.37,Okay.
631,00:26:09.43,00:26:09.43,That's a start.
632,00:26:10.77,00:26:10.77,"- Frank, I'm starting to figure"
633,00:26:11.93,00:26:11.93,out about Frank is he's a teacher.
634,00:26:13.73,00:26:13.73,He loves instruction.
635,00:26:16.10,00:26:16.10,"You know, I think that probably comes from a little bit, mostly"
636,00:26:18.37,00:26:18.37,"from the military, in terms of giving orders."
637,00:26:20.20,00:26:20.20,"- Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute."
638,00:26:22.27,00:26:22.27,Are you planning on shooting?
639,00:26:22.27,00:26:22.27,- No.
640,00:26:23.80,00:26:23.80,"- Oh, okay, because you are loaded right now."
641,00:26:26.13,00:26:26.13,It's like having a gun right now in your hand.
642,00:26:28.33,00:26:28.33,"- Frank, definitely, I mean, this is Frank's thing."
643,00:26:31.03,00:26:31.03,"He's very, you know, vocal and giving us all the help he can."
644,00:26:35.27,00:26:35.27,- Okay. It's a timing issue.
645,00:26:37.53,00:26:37.53,"- Without him, you know, I wouldn't know all the little"
646,00:26:39.90,00:26:39.90,stuff that could bring us the win later on.
647,00:26:42.93,00:26:42.93,"- Very good, straight arrow."
648,00:26:45.43,00:26:45.43,See how nice and straight that went?
649,00:26:47.07,00:26:47.07,- (whoops) Beautiful!
650,00:26:49.33,00:26:49.33,"- That's very nice, nicely done."
651,00:26:50.80,00:26:50.80,"- This immunity challenge is important, because right now,"
652,00:26:53.03,00:26:53.03,"although on paper the old Boran tribe has a one-person edge,"
653,00:26:58.97,00:26:58.97,you still don't know what's going on.
654,00:27:01.70,00:27:01.70,- Yes.
655,00:27:19.27,00:27:19.27,- (Probst) First things first.
656,00:27:20.53,00:27:20.53,"Lindsey, got to take back immunity idol."
657,00:27:24.20,00:27:24.20,Immunity is back up for grabs.
658,00:27:26.60,00:27:26.60,"As you can see, we have some fires, nice and smoky, burning."
659,00:27:29.33,00:27:29.33,Those will come into play for today's immunity challenge.
660,00:27:31.80,00:27:31.80,We're going to test your
661,00:27:32.87,00:27:32.87,proficiency with a bow and arrow.
662,00:27:35.23,00:27:35.23,"Each tribe has five targets, ranging from 30 to 70 feet."
663,00:27:39.37,00:27:39.37,"You'll square off against each other, one member from each"
664,00:27:42.10,00:27:42.10,"tribe taking one shot, then the next pair will go."
665,00:27:45.50,00:27:45.50,First tribe using lighted arrows to light up all five targets
666,00:27:49.23,00:27:49.23,"wins immunity, avoids the vote."
667,00:27:51.87,00:27:51.87,Pick your first shooter and wait for my go.
668,00:27:54.97,00:27:54.97,"Samburu, because you have one extra member, you've chosen"
669,00:27:57.00,00:27:57.00,Kelly to sit out.
670,00:27:59.27,00:27:59.27,"First shooters, take your spot."
671,00:28:01.73,00:28:01.73,"- All right, Kim!"
672,00:28:02.77,00:28:02.77,- Let's go!
673,00:28:04.47,00:28:04.47,- (whooping)

709,00:29:24.43,00:29:24.43,"- Come on, you can do this."

760,00:32:09.33,00:32:09.33,"So we find ourselves faced with Tribal Council today, which puts"
761,00:32:12.43,00:32:12.43,us all in a potentially vulnerable position.
762,00:32:16.57,00:32:16.57,"Because now, you know, we find ourselves having to..."
763,00:32:19.33,00:32:19.33,to vote someone out.
764,00:32:23.17,00:32:23.17,- You and I have not talked at all about this thing tonight.

772,00:32:39.60,00:32:39.60,"- Right. I'm not taking anything personal, and if y'all"
773,00:32:41.70,00:32:41.70,"vote for me, that's cool."
774,00:32:43.00,00:32:43.00,"I mean, that's part of the game, that's part of the game."
775,00:32:45.53,00:32:45.53,I'm totally prepared for it.
776,00:32:47.07,00:32:47.07,- All right.

779,00:32:53.57,00:32:53.57,I'm not going to lose sleep about it anymore.
780,00:32:55.30,00:32:55.30,"If we could just do the thing tonight, it's going to be me,"
781,00:32:58.43,00:32:58.43,"and I can beat him, okay?"
782,00:33:03.80,00:33:03.80,"We were talking about going to Tribal Council, and Kelly was"
783,00:33:07.17,00:33:07.17,standing on the other side of
784,00:33:08.70,00:33:08.70,the hut and we didn't realize it.
785,00:33:10.43,00:33:10.43,So now Lindsey thinks that they know she has votes.
786,00:33:14.13,00:33:14.13,- She heard everything.
787,00:33:15.57,00:33:15.57,Positive.

789,00:33:20.70,00:33:20.70,"I just, I can't believe that Brandon didn't whisper, and she"
790,00:33:23.30,00:33:23.30,was standing right there.
791,00:33:24.73,00:33:24.73,- That may have just... me.
792,00:33:28.23,00:33:28.23,"- He's, like, ""I'm going to make it through this, it's okay,"
793,00:33:29.93,00:33:29.93,"da-da-da-da-da."""
794,00:33:31.43,00:33:31.43,"So they've got this plan, and they sound like they've had it"
795,00:33:33.53,00:33:33.53,"for, like, two or three days now."
796,00:33:35.10,00:33:35.10,"- If that's the way they're going to vote, that's the way"
797,00:33:37.13,00:33:37.13,they're going to vote.
798,00:33:38.20,00:33:38.20,There's nothing we can do.
799,00:33:40.53,00:33:40.53,"- Yeah, there is something we can do."
800,00:33:42.07,00:33:42.07,- What?
801,00:33:43.93,00:33:43.93,- Vote with them.
802,00:33:45.73,00:33:45.73,- Vote with them?
803,00:33:49.20,00:33:49.20,"You know, we made a pact with Brandon in the beginning of this"
804,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,"game, but he screwed me over by letting them overhear that"
805,00:33:54.30,00:33:54.30,"I have votes, so I was... I was upset."
806,00:33:56.77,00:33:56.77,"So right now, I feel like this"
807,00:33:58.20,00:33:58.20,is a selfish game and I'm in it for myself.
808,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,We're not Samburu anymore.
809,00:34:01.87,00:34:01.87,- Right.
810,00:34:01.87,00:34:01.87,- You know what I mean?
811,00:34:03.53,00:34:03.53,- So you guys are going to... relinquish Brandon?
812,00:34:06.13,00:34:06.13,"- Yeah, I mean, I just feel so bad, like,"
813,00:34:08.93,00:34:08.93,"selling someone out, but..."
814,00:34:11.40,00:34:11.40,- Everyone would look really positively at it.
815,00:34:14.33,00:34:14.33,- Let me think about it.
816,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,"- Yeah, just think about it, we can talk after lunch."
817,00:34:17.73,00:34:17.73,"Okay, that's fine."
818,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,"- I just thought, oh, my God, if this can secure them not"
819,00:34:22.57,00:34:22.57,"voting for me, I'll do it, and this isn't cheating."
820,00:34:25.37,00:34:25.37,I'm not sticking a card up my sleeve.
821,00:34:26.97,00:34:26.97,This is just making the right move for myself.
822,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,"So what if we vote against Brandon, then what happens?"
823,00:34:33.07,00:34:33.07,- It sounds like a kind of a merger to me.
824,00:34:36.27,00:34:36.27,- And if we don't?
825,00:34:38.30,00:34:38.30,"- Well, if not, it's going to hurt everybody later."
826,00:34:42.93,00:34:42.93,"- They're basically saying align with us, we'll take you"
827,00:34:45.23,00:34:45.23,"further, and I'm just not going to do it."
828,00:34:47.47,00:34:47.47,I'm not comfortable with it.
829,00:34:48.80,00:34:48.80,I know Brandon wouldn't do it to me.
830,00:34:50.47,00:34:50.47,"He wouldn't do it to me, no matter what."
831,00:34:53.13,00:34:53.13,- I'm kind of in a no-win situation.
832,00:34:56.17,00:34:56.17,"I mean, do I go against my personal morals and values"
833,00:34:59.80,00:34:59.80,and vote against Brandon?
834,00:35:01.63,00:35:01.63,Or do I vote with Brandon and Kim and risk being the next one
835,00:35:05.63,00:35:05.63,voted out of here?
836,00:35:07.10,00:35:07.10,"I don't know what I'm going to do, and I don't think I'll know"
837,00:35:09.53,00:35:09.53,until I get to Tribal Council.
838,00:35:34.70,00:35:34.70,"- How's it going, guys?"
839,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50,First time we've had this configuration
840,00:35:37.77,00:35:37.77,here at Tribal Council.
841,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"Lex, take me back to when you had this new tribe formed."
842,00:35:43.60,00:35:43.60,How is that working out?
843,00:35:45.03,00:35:45.03,"- It was a real shocker to begin with, but I think we've"
844,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,all acclimated pretty well.
845,00:35:48.80,00:35:48.80,"We've kind of come together as a tribe,"
846,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,which makes a night like tonight pretty tough.
847,00:35:53.37,00:35:53.37,"- (Probst) Brandon, at this point,"
848,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,do you trust these other five?
849,00:35:56.90,00:35:56.90,"- I think that as far as trust goes,"
850,00:35:59.43,00:35:59.43,you don't trust anybody in the game.
851,00:36:01.00,00:36:01.00,"It's just, it's a fact of life, one of us has to go,"
852,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,"and it may be me, may be somebody else, we'll just see."
853,00:36:06.10,00:36:06.10,"- (Probst) Kim, is this game more ethically challenging"
854,00:36:09.00,00:36:09.00,than you anticipated?
855,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,- Yes. I think that you either decide that you're going to play
856,00:36:13.73,00:36:13.73,"this for me, and I'm going to get myself to be number one and"
857,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,"as far as I can, or you decide I'm going to do this with value"
858,00:36:20.73,00:36:20.73,"and integrity and all of my own ethics, and I don't think"
859,00:36:23.70,00:36:23.70,that there's a middle road anywhere.
860,00:36:25.23,00:36:25.23,"- (Probst) Kelly, what started out as Samburu and Boran,"
861,00:36:28.10,00:36:28.10,are those tribes just gone now?
862,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,- I wouldn't say they're just gone.
863,00:36:30.93,00:36:30.93,"Obviously, you know, we..."
864,00:36:32.43,00:36:32.43,"we're very close with some of the people that were on Boran,"
865,00:36:34.47,00:36:34.47,"and we still have loyalties to them,"
866,00:36:35.93,00:36:35.93,but it just really opened up our eyes that these people
867,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,"are great, and it's really changed up"
868,00:36:38.57,00:36:38.57,the game in a lot of ways.
869,00:36:39.70,00:36:39.70,It's made everything a lot harder.
870,00:36:43.30,00:36:43.30,- It's time to vote.
871,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,"Brandon, you're up first."
872,00:37:28.67,00:37:28.67,- (whispering) I hate having to vote for this person.
873,00:37:30.90,00:37:30.90,"I'd rather vote for myself right now, 'cause this is miserable."
874,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80,- I'll go tally the votes.
875,00:37:58.50,00:37:58.50,"Once the votes have been read, the decision is final."
876,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,The person will be asked to
877,00:38:02.00,00:38:02.00,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
878,00:38:04.67,00:38:04.67,I'll read the votes.
879,00:38:07.90,00:38:07.90,First vote...
880,00:38:11.53,00:38:11.53,Big Tom.
881,00:38:17.97,00:38:17.97,Big Tom.
882,00:38:25.00,00:38:25.00,Lindsey.
883,00:38:32.03,00:38:32.03,Lindsey.
884,00:38:38.50,00:38:38.50,Tom.
885,00:38:40.97,00:38:40.97,- Hey.
886,00:38:42.03,00:38:42.03,- I'm so sorry.
887,00:38:43.07,00:38:43.07,- It's okay. Stop it.
888,00:38:45.83,00:38:45.83,It's me. Go.
889,00:38:49.03,00:38:49.03,- (Probst) Lindsey.
890,00:38:52.13,00:38:52.13,"- Guys, it's a game!"
891,00:38:54.57,00:38:54.57,"- (Probst) Lindsey, where are you going?"
892,00:38:56.47,00:38:56.47,Sit it.
893,00:38:57.50,00:38:57.50,- (laughing)
894,00:38:58.93,00:38:58.93,"- (Probst) That's three votes Lindsey, three votes Tom."
895,00:39:01.27,00:39:01.27,We're going to vote again.
896,00:39:02.37,00:39:02.37,- Okay.
897,00:39:03.50,00:39:03.50,"- (Probst) But before we vote,"
898,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00,I'm going to give you guys a chance to plead your case.
899,00:39:07.63,00:39:07.63,You're fighting for your life in this game right now.
900,00:39:09.93,00:39:09.93,Be convincing.
901,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,"Tom, you first."
902,00:39:13.13,00:39:13.13,"- Well, only thing I can say is, I'm who I am, I'm nobody"
903,00:39:17.93,00:39:17.93,"different, and I'm not going to change."
904,00:39:19.33,00:39:19.33,"So... that's... you got Big Tom here, and that's the way it is."
905,00:39:24.10,00:39:24.10,"- Lindsey, obviously tribal lines coming into play here."
906,00:39:27.83,00:39:27.83,This is a chance for you to turn somebody's vote around.
907,00:39:31.80,00:39:31.80,"- Um, all I really want to say is that I came to Tribal Council"
908,00:39:35.63,00:39:35.63,"tonight thinking, um, the majority of them were going"
909,00:39:39.80,00:39:39.80,"to vote for Brandon, and I considered it."
910,00:39:42.67,00:39:42.67,I considered joining with them and voting for Brandon.
911,00:39:45.40,00:39:45.40,"And on the way here, um..."
912,00:39:48.70,00:39:48.70,(voice breaking) ...my dignity took over.
913,00:39:54.27,00:39:54.27,"I don't care if I'm voted out tonight, because I didn't vote"
914,00:39:57.53,00:39:57.53,"for a friend of mine, and that makes me the happiest person on"
915,00:40:00.43,00:40:00.43,the face of the Earth.
916,00:40:02.00,00:40:02.00,So I'm not going to convince you
917,00:40:03.77,00:40:03.77,"to keep me, 'cause I'm leaving with my pride."
918,00:40:08.23,00:40:08.23,That's all.
919,00:40:10.10,00:40:10.10,"- (Probst) Obviously, a tough vote for you guys."
920,00:40:12.30,00:40:12.30,I believe that.
921,00:40:13.53,00:40:13.53,We got to do it again.
922,00:40:15.80,00:40:15.80,"Lindsey and Tom, you won't vote this time."
923,00:40:17.47,00:40:17.47,"The other four of you will,"
924,00:40:19.13,00:40:19.13,"and you have to vote, obviously, for Tom or for Lindsey."
925,00:40:42.80,00:40:42.80,I'll go tally the votes.
926,00:40:55.03,00:40:55.03,I'll read the re-vote.
927,00:41:00.53,00:41:00.53,First vote...
928,00:41:02.57,00:41:02.57,Big Tom.
929,00:41:07.93,00:41:07.93,Tom.
930,00:41:12.57,00:41:12.57,Lindsey.
931,00:41:20.40,00:41:20.40,And we're deadlocked.
932,00:41:25.53,00:41:25.53,"Well, as you guys know, Tribal Council is a place where you"
933,00:41:29.27,00:41:29.27,account for your actions.
934,00:41:30.50,00:41:30.50,"In the case of a deadlock,"
935,00:41:31.63,00:41:31.63,we go to votes cast at previous Tribal Councils.
936,00:41:34.60,00:41:34.60,"Tom, how many votes have you had cast against you?"
937,00:41:37.33,00:41:37.33,- None that I know of.
938,00:41:38.80,00:41:38.80,- (Probst) Lindsey?
939,00:41:39.87,00:41:39.87,- A couple.
940,00:41:40.93,00:41:40.93,- (Probst) Four?
941,00:41:41.93,00:41:41.93,- Maybe.
942,00:41:43.17,00:41:43.17,- (Probst) That's enough.
943,00:41:44.43,00:41:44.43,You need to bring me your torch.
944,00:41:46.37,00:41:46.37,"- Oh, stop it."
945,00:41:48.90,00:41:48.90,(speaking inaudibly)
946,00:41:56.23,00:41:56.23,It's okay.
947,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,"It's a game, guys."
948,00:42:00.13,00:42:00.13,You're the best.
949,00:42:01.97,00:42:01.97,"- I love you, too."
950,00:42:10.03,00:42:10.03,"- Lindsey, the tribe has spoken."
951,00:42:17.10,00:42:17.10,It's time for you to go.
952,00:42:18.13,00:42:18.13,Good night.
953,00:42:19.13,00:42:19.13,- Bye.
954,00:42:20.47,00:42:20.47,- We'll miss you.
955,00:42:25.87,00:42:25.87,"- Well, clearly, in spite of what was said tonight,"
956,00:42:28.17,00:42:28.17,"tribal lines still playing a big part, because this was the most"
957,00:42:30.90,00:42:30.90,emotional Tribal Council I think we've ever had.
958,00:42:34.03,00:42:34.03,You guys can head back to camp.
959,00:42:51.40,00:42:51.40,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
960,00:42:58.13,00:42:58.13,- (Probst) Next time on   Survivor...
961,00:42:59.93,00:42:59.93,"The tribes eagerly anticipate the traditional merge,"
962,00:43:02.27,00:43:02.27,but anxieties run high.
963,00:43:03.83,00:43:03.83,- It is absolutely horrible.
964,00:43:06.97,00:43:06.97,- (Probst) Because no one knows how or when it will happen.
965,00:43:10.13,00:43:10.13,- Kind of like standing on a corner
966,00:43:11.50,00:43:11.50,and the bus didn't come by.
967,00:43:12.80,00:43:12.80,"- Wake up, wake up."
968,00:43:13.90,00:43:13.90,"Yo, we got mail."
969,00:43:14.97,00:43:14.97,It is big and it is nasty.
970,00:43:23.07,00:43:23.07,- Tonight's vote was a surprise.
971,00:43:24.50,00:43:24.50,I thought that they would vote for Brandon.
972,00:43:26.27,00:43:26.27,"I honestly don't think I could have gone on much longer,"
973,00:43:28.33,00:43:28.33,because this game is a serious emotional roller coaster ride.
974,00:43:31.87,00:43:31.87,"And, you know, I'm an athlete, but I'd much rather do it in a"
975,00:43:35.23,00:43:35.23,"civilized environment, where I'm not battling malicious behavior."
976,00:43:38.57,00:43:38.57,I don't like that aspect of this game at all.
977,00:43:41.00,00:43:41.00,See you on the dark side.
