24,00:00:46.40,00:00:46.40,"Well, there's beena lot of assumptions made by you"
25,00:00:48.27,00:00:48.27,guys so far in this game.
26,00:00:50.33,00:00:50.33,One of them is that in threedays there will be a merge.

35,00:02:23.27,00:02:23.27,So the merger is coming up.
36,00:02:24.80,00:02:24.80,"- My gut feeling would be, ifthe merger was changed from the"
37,00:02:28.00,00:02:28.00,"norm, that it would be soonerrather than later."
38,00:02:30.83,00:02:30.83,"- Well,I think either way,"
39,00:02:32.33,00:02:32.33,beginning tomorrow morning we'rejust going to have to be ready

42,00:02:37.00,00:02:37.00,- The whole thing with themerge is driving me insane.
43,00:02:39.23,00:02:39.23,"At the end of Tribal Council theother night, Jeff said,"
44,00:02:41.60,00:02:41.60,"""You guys assumethe merge is in three days."""

46,00:02:47.43,00:02:47.43,He throwsthe thought out there.
47,00:02:49.57,00:02:49.57,"Put it in our head that, like,oh, my God, maybe the merge"
48,00:02:51.20,00:02:51.20, isn't in three days.
49,00:02:53.57,00:02:53.57,We rationed our food so we'reending all our food at
50,00:02:55.83,00:02:55.83,"the merger,which is in three days."
51,00:02:57.50,00:02:57.50,If we eat all our food andthere's no merger after three
52,00:02:59.70,00:02:59.70,"days, we have no food."
53,00:03:01.63,00:03:01.63,- We have three chickens.
54,00:03:03.57,00:03:03.57,"- We need to decide,do we stay"
55,00:03:05.17,00:03:05.17,"with our normalfood intake, do we ration?"
56,00:03:08.17,00:03:08.17,"I mean, how do you guyswant to proceed?"
57,00:03:10.13,00:03:10.13,- We prepare for the worst.
58,00:03:10.13,00:03:10.13,- Yeah.
59,00:03:11.67,00:03:11.67,"- I mean, what happensif it's in ten days?"
60,00:03:13.37,00:03:13.37,We're screwed.
61,00:03:28.23,00:03:28.23,(crickets chirping)
62,00:03:31.20,00:03:31.20,- I got another hourbefore daylight.
63,00:03:32.73,00:03:32.73,- Mm-hmm.
64,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57,"- (whispers) We got, like,five-hour watch."
65,00:03:43.67,00:03:43.67,I think we came outabout 1:00 in the morning.
66,00:03:47.13,00:03:47.13,Tom and I took in a long nightshift last night.
67,00:03:49.67,00:03:49.67,"Everyone else took about an hourand a half, two hours, and we"
68,00:03:52.47,00:03:52.47,"got, like... we got stuck withabout five hours."
69,00:03:54.93,00:03:54.93,We've been staying up all nightfor over two weeks.
70,00:03:56.93,00:03:56.93,These guys have no conceptof what a three-hour shift is.
71,00:04:00.57,00:04:00.57,They just throw a log onthe fire and go to bed.
72,00:04:02.93,00:04:02.93,- That sucks.
73,00:04:04.13,00:04:04.13,"- I know, it's terrible,"
74,00:04:05.40,00:04:05.40,but she just doesnot want to do it at all.
75,00:04:08.10,00:04:08.10,- I think Lindsey's heart is inthe right place.
76,00:04:10.77,00:04:10.77,"- Oh, yeah,she's a sweet girl."
77,00:04:12.50,00:04:12.50,- She's just a big...
78,00:04:15.57,00:04:15.57,- It was painfully obvious themoment we stepped foot in camp
79,00:04:18.43,00:04:18.43,"here that, you know, we hadthree people here that..."
80,00:04:20.70,00:04:20.70,they were here fora little resort vacation.
81,00:04:23.43,00:04:23.43,They weren't hereto do anything
82,00:04:25.03,00:04:25.03,but nap and eatand make a couple meals.
83,00:04:27.50,00:04:27.50,- How was your guys'last shift?
84,00:04:28.77,00:04:28.77,"Was ittoo long, too short?"
85,00:04:30.40,00:04:30.40,- It was at leastfive hours.
86,00:04:31.47,00:04:31.47,"- Was it, really?"
87,00:04:35.13,00:04:35.13,Everyone isstressed out right now.
88,00:04:36.80,00:04:36.80,This whole switcheroothing has made
89,00:04:38.47,00:04:38.47,everyone's mindkind of go crazy.
90,00:04:40.47,00:04:40.47,"Everyone is thinking, ""Oh, we'retwo new tribes now."
91,00:04:42.23,00:04:42.23,"Let's not thinkof our old tribes."""
92,00:04:43.37,00:04:43.37,"But it's inevitable,"
93,00:04:44.47,00:04:44.47,you're going to think ofyour old tribe.
94,00:04:45.87,00:04:45.87,- I want to know who the hellgot the boot.
95,00:04:48.13,00:04:48.13,- Frank is a target.
96,00:04:49.30,00:04:49.30,- I think everyonewill vote for him.
97,00:04:52.63,00:04:52.63,- I hope so.
98,00:04:54.20,00:04:54.20,"- People just want to seewhat's shaking up at Boran,"
99,00:04:56.67,00:04:56.67,because what goes on over therecould totally affect
100,00:04:58.83,00:04:58.83,what happens over here.
101,00:05:00.53,00:05:00.53,- What do you think?
102,00:05:01.83,00:05:01.83,- I'm concerned that Kim mayhave gotten canned.
103,00:05:04.93,00:05:04.93,"- We know if we get beat in achallenge, we've got our vote,"
104,00:05:08.27,00:05:08.27,and we know it's going to bethree-three.
105,00:05:10.80,00:05:10.80,"They're going to pick outsomebody on us, and we're going"
106,00:05:13.03,00:05:13.03,to pick out somebodyon them.
107,00:05:15.30,00:05:15.30,But the key to the voteis what's happened before.
108,00:05:19.60,00:05:19.60,"- If we have to go toTribal Council,"
109,00:05:21.67,00:05:21.67,it's allabout past votes.
110,00:05:23.90,00:05:23.90,"If we have a tie, it comes downto who has more votes, then I"
111,00:05:27.13,00:05:27.13,"already have four votesagainst me, so I'd be gone."
112,00:05:30.70,00:05:30.70,- Three more nights y'all havegot with us.
113,00:05:32.63,00:05:32.63,"- God, I'm gladwe got you guys."
114,00:05:33.97,00:05:33.97,"- Yeah, we lucked out,we did really, really well."
115,00:05:35.87,00:05:35.87,"- I'm really trying to save myown butt, you know?"
116,00:05:38.13,00:05:38.13,I don't want them to have anyclue about my situation.
117,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,"I mean, I set a goal for myself,and I am the kind of person that"
118,00:05:44.30,00:05:44.30,"when I set a goal,I'm going to achieve it."
119,00:06:01.63,00:06:01.63,- I can't stopthinking about food.
120,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,I dream about food.
121,00:06:05.73,00:06:05.73,I think about food when I'meating food.
122,00:06:07.33,00:06:07.33,I think about food 24/7.
123,00:06:10.50,00:06:10.50,Any eggs yet?
124,00:06:10.50,00:06:10.50,- No.
125,00:06:12.60,00:06:12.60,"- Ah, you know what thatmeans-- chopping-block day."
126,00:06:15.90,00:06:15.90,"- Since we got thosechickens,"
127,00:06:17.40,00:06:17.40,we'll have tokeep an eye on you.
128,00:06:18.47,00:06:18.47,"Every time you walkby the cage,"
129,00:06:20.53,00:06:20.53,we'll have tokeep an eye on you.
130,00:06:21.60,00:06:21.60,- I will not deny that I'm
131,00:06:22.90,00:06:22.90,having homicidal feelings aboutthose damn chickens.
132,00:06:25.37,00:06:25.37,- What doyou guys think?
133,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00,What do you and Kim think aboutthe chicken situation?
134,00:06:29.10,00:06:29.10,- I don't know.
135,00:06:30.20,00:06:30.20,"I mean, you justwant to eat them?"
136,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,- I'd rather have eggs.
137,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,"- Yeah, me, too."
138,00:06:34.63,00:06:34.63,- For some reason I don't knowthat that's going to happen.
139,00:06:37.53,00:06:37.53,- Yeah.
140,00:06:38.93,00:06:38.93,"Some people want to eatthe chickens right away,"
141,00:06:40.90,00:06:40.90,"like Clarence,and some people want to wait"
142,00:06:44.10,00:06:44.10,to see if they'll laysome eggs.
143,00:06:45.70,00:06:45.70,"It's just, the problem is, if wego to the merger and we're not"
144,00:06:47.80,00:06:47.80,"allowed to take the chickens,then it's a waste."
145,00:06:51.77,00:06:51.77,- Chicken nuggets.
146,00:06:53.87,00:06:53.87,"- Clarence, are they actinglike they're thinking about"
147,00:06:55.73,00:06:55.73,laying eggs?

155,00:07:17.87,00:07:17.87,"- Whatever it is,I hope there's no animals."
156,00:07:20.27,00:07:20.27,"No goats, chickens."

175,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97,"- Maybe it's, like, a giantboard game or something."
176,00:08:03.80,00:08:03.80,- How comfortable are you guyswith all the stuff in the book?
177,00:08:06.23,00:08:06.23,Pretty good withall that?

179,00:08:08.77,00:08:08.77,that it's probably somethingsort of cerebral.

410,00:16:46.90,00:16:46.90,which is completely...a joke to me.
411,00:16:51.33,00:16:51.33,(chickens clucking)
412,00:16:54.27,00:16:54.27,"- Believe it or not, I thinkwe're all unsure what the hens"
413,00:16:57.23,00:16:57.23,need to do to laythe eggs.
414,00:16:58.63,00:16:58.63,Frank wants toput a net out there
415,00:16:59.97,00:16:59.97,so they can run aroundand play.
416,00:17:03.20,00:17:03.20,(quiet laugh)
417,00:17:06.80,00:17:06.80,"- Oh, givingyou something nice."
418,00:17:10.30,00:17:10.30,"I think that's better for them,don't you?"
419,00:17:11.97,00:17:11.97,- One of you sayyour good-byes.
420,00:17:14.07,00:17:14.07,"Don't get mad.Don't get mad, man."
421,00:17:15.73,00:17:15.73,"- Oh, she's telling you."
422,00:17:16.83,00:17:16.83,- Don't get mad.
423,00:17:17.87,00:17:17.87,Tribal Councilfor you tonight.
424,00:17:20.37,00:17:20.37,"- As much as we'rejoking about it,"
425,00:17:21.70,00:17:21.70,I am serious about killingone of those chickens.
426,00:17:23.73,00:17:23.73,(knife scraping)
427,00:17:28.07,00:17:28.07,"You know, I've talked to eachone of the chickens personally,"
428,00:17:32.00,00:17:32.00,"and I've informed them that,you know, they're on notice."
429,00:17:34.80,00:17:34.80,- Last night you told them youloved them and...
430,00:17:37.13,00:17:37.13,"- I do, man. I also told them,you know, you got 24 hours to"
431,00:17:40.27,00:17:40.27,"lay an egg,and now technically,"
432,00:17:41.93,00:17:41.93,"it'll be 48 hours, so that'son them."
433,00:17:44.53,00:17:44.53,- What if they lay an egg bytomorrow morning?
434,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,- Then we spare them.How's that?
435,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,- Really?
436,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,- I swear.
437,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,"- You hear that,you guys?"
438,00:17:50.40,00:17:50.40,"Clarence says ifwe find an egg in the morning,"
439,00:17:52.37,00:17:52.37,the chicken lives.
440,00:17:54.27,00:17:54.27,"- All they have to dois lay an egg, one egg."
441,00:18:06.90,00:18:06.90,"- I mean, we don't know what'shappened over there."
442,00:18:10.10,00:18:10.10,"I mean, we have no idea,like, they have no idea that all"
443,00:18:12.00,00:18:12.00,of us are over here totallygetting along.
444,00:18:13.50,00:18:13.50,"- Yeah, that's true."
445,00:18:14.87,00:18:14.87,- I'm kind of loving it.
446,00:18:16.03,00:18:16.03,I kind of think it's cool.
447,00:18:18.67,00:18:18.67,- I've had some moments withKelly that I feel like we've
448,00:18:20.77,00:18:20.77,"sort of bonded and we've had agood time, and she has expressed"
449,00:18:23.73,00:18:23.73,"that she's fearful of herdemise, so..."
450,00:18:27.03,00:18:27.03,She seems pretty genuine.
451,00:18:29.20,00:18:29.20,- (whispers)I think Kelly really likes her.
452,00:18:31.70,00:18:31.70,- I think they really likeall three of us.
453,00:18:33.73,00:18:33.73,But that hasnothing to do with it.
454,00:18:36.17,00:18:36.17,We cannot vote for Lindsey.
455,00:18:38.33,00:18:38.33,"If she gets voted against, I'mgone in the next six days."
456,00:18:41.40,00:18:41.40,And that'sthe same with you.
457,00:18:43.77,00:18:43.77,And that's notgood enough.
458,00:18:45.73,00:18:45.73,"- If we have to go to a TribalCouncil, we're assuming that it"
459,00:18:48.30,00:18:48.30,will go to a tiebreaker and
460,00:18:49.83,00:18:49.83,they'll ask us questions fromthis handbook.
461,00:18:51.37,00:18:51.37,- Which is whatthey did the last time.
462,00:18:52.90,00:18:52.90,- Which is what they didthe last time.
463,00:18:54.57,00:18:54.57,"- But, see, you're not, I mean,you don't see the big picture."
464,00:18:56.40,00:18:56.40,They are not... they are notgoing to vote for you.
465,00:18:59.97,00:18:59.97,"They like you more than me,'cause I have haven't been"
466,00:19:02.10,00:19:02.10,trying to beall that extra nice to them.
467,00:19:04.40,00:19:04.40,I just haven't.
468,00:19:05.77,00:19:05.77,"I mean, I don't care."
469,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,(rooster crowing)
470,00:19:17.00,00:19:17.00,(chickens clucking)
471,00:19:26.93,00:19:26.93,"- Good morning,boys and girls."
472,00:19:29.97,00:19:29.97,Did you guysleave us any eggs?
473,00:19:31.90,00:19:31.90,(chickens clucking)
474,00:19:33.23,00:19:33.23,"I went into the cage thismorning, and I didn't see"
475,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,"anything in the beginning atall, and I thought, ""Oh, damn,"
476,00:19:38.27,00:19:38.27,"these chickens didn't layany eggs again."""
477,00:19:46.37,00:19:46.37,(quietly)Yay. Look at this.
478,00:19:49.13,00:19:49.13,"Look at this,you guys. Yay."
479,00:19:51.63,00:19:51.63,"Yes, yes."
480,00:19:53.47,00:19:53.47,"Yes, we have eggs."
481,00:19:54.97,00:19:54.97,"- Oh, don't tell..."
482,00:19:56.90,00:19:56.90,She's gotsomething in her hand.
483,00:19:57.97,00:19:57.97,- (whistling a tune)
484,00:19:59.03,00:19:59.03,- I'll be damned.
485,00:20:01.33,00:20:01.33,"Look at that, see?"
486,00:20:02.77,00:20:02.77,"You've got an egg,right?"
487,00:20:06.47,00:20:06.47,"Oh, yeah!"
488,00:20:08.63,00:20:08.63,Great.
489,00:20:09.63,00:20:09.63,- Isn't that cool?
490,00:20:10.97,00:20:10.97,Let's just put it right there.
491,00:20:12.50,00:20:12.50,- Just let it sit there.
492,00:20:15.23,00:20:15.23,- So we're just going to keepit right on the tray there until
493,00:20:17.70,00:20:17.70,Clarence wakes upand sees the egg.
494,00:20:19.83,00:20:19.83,"(imitates Clarence)Oh, damn!"
495,00:20:21.30,00:20:21.30,"Damn, those chickens."
496,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,We finallyhave an egg.
497,00:20:24.60,00:20:24.60,- I loved it this morning whenKim brought over that egg.
498,00:20:27.67,00:20:27.67,"'cause last night Clarence was,like, ""Well, one of them have an"
499,00:20:30.47,00:20:30.47,"egg, we don't have toeat the chicken."""
500,00:20:35.70,00:20:35.70,- An egg!
501,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,- Shh.
502,00:20:41.03,00:20:41.03,- (whispers) Wow!
503,00:20:42.03,00:20:42.03,- Shh. He's coming.
504,00:20:48.23,00:20:48.23,- What's up?
505,00:20:50.13,00:20:50.13,"- What's up,Clarence?"
506,00:20:54.20,00:20:54.20,"- Aw, hell, no!Come on!"
507,00:20:56.37,00:20:56.37,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
508,00:20:58.13,00:20:58.13,"(whooping, cheering)"
509,00:21:01.40,00:21:01.40,- No chicken for you!
510,00:21:03.03,00:21:03.03,- I hate youand you and you
511,00:21:05.63,00:21:05.63,"and you, and you did it just tospite me, so whatever."
512,00:21:09.20,00:21:09.20,"And you laid... and they laidthe smallest egg possible, too."
513,00:21:11.10,00:21:11.10,(laughter)
514,00:21:13.73,00:21:13.73,"If you scramble that egg,it might disappear."
515,00:21:16.07,00:21:16.07,(laughter)
516,00:21:18.37,00:21:18.37,"Oh, I hate thosechickens."
517,00:21:19.80,00:21:19.80,"- Truth is,I don't think any"
518,00:21:20.93,00:21:20.93,of us mind killing a chickenfor dinner.
519,00:21:22.63,00:21:22.63,"- We tormented him a littlebit, but we decided we were"
520,00:21:26.27,00:21:26.27,going to kill a chicken and eatit for dinner anyway.
521,00:21:37.27,00:21:37.27,- You can come to my house
522,00:21:38.37,00:21:38.37,and carve a Thanksgivingturkey anytime.
523,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,- Wow.
524,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,- Mmm.
525,00:21:42.87,00:21:42.87,"- Oh, my God."
526,00:21:44.17,00:21:44.17,The chicken tastes great.
527,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,"Everyone had a hand in preparingit, and, I mean, I was just,"
528,00:21:49.27,00:21:49.27,"wow, it was just... mwah!"
529,00:21:52.03,00:21:52.03,- Oh.
530,00:21:53.43,00:21:53.43,(chuckling)
531,00:21:54.83,00:21:54.83,"- Oh, God."
532,00:21:55.87,00:21:55.87,- Okay. Well...
533,00:21:55.87,00:21:55.87,- Wow.
534,00:21:57.47,00:21:57.47,- How good is that?
535,00:21:58.50,00:21:58.50,- Mmm.
536,00:21:59.97,00:21:59.97,"- Since our arrival, Teresa andI, we've been smiling."
537,00:22:03.83,00:22:03.83,It's been a verycomfortable transition.
538,00:22:05.73,00:22:05.73,"Thank you, everyone."
539,00:22:06.87,00:22:06.87,"You know,I wish we would have"
540,00:22:08.10,00:22:08.10,been here from day one withthese people.
541,00:22:09.67,00:22:09.67,"- Y'all, that wasvery delicious."
542,00:22:15.27,00:22:15.27,♪♪
543,00:22:32.63,00:22:32.63,- (whispering)That makes sense.
544,00:22:34.10,00:22:34.10,"I can't believe I never thoughtof that, why Kim was doing it."
545,00:22:36.93,00:22:36.93,"- No, I didn't know she wasdoing this."
546,00:22:39.30,00:22:39.30,- She did it at the...
547,00:22:40.67,00:22:40.67,- All I saw her dois this.
548,00:22:42.37,00:22:42.37,"- She didthat yesterday, too."
549,00:22:44.03,00:22:44.03,- I'm such an idiot.
550,00:22:45.87,00:22:45.87,"All this time, Kim, at thechallenges, she was doing this."
551,00:22:48.03,00:22:48.03,"I'm, like, what doesthis mean, lose?"
552,00:22:49.43,00:22:49.43,Do you want meto throw the challenge?
553,00:22:51.13,00:22:51.13,What's the L? The L?
554,00:22:52.70,00:22:52.70,"Then I'm sitting there, and I'm,like, ""Oh, Lindsey."""
555,00:22:55.50,00:22:55.50,"Obviously, she thinksLindsey has votes against her."
556,00:22:57.97,00:22:57.97,And also I think she was tryingto tell me Brandon.
557,00:23:00.67,00:23:00.67,"Because if she was doingsomething like this, I don't"
558,00:23:02.47,00:23:02.47,"know, I think it's ""B""in sign language."
559,00:23:03.90,00:23:03.90,She knows sign language.I don't know it.
560,00:23:05.40,00:23:05.40,"- They were totallycommunicating,"
561,00:23:07.30,00:23:07.30,"and I was like...""What's going on?"""
562,00:23:09.73,00:23:09.73,And she kept going...
563,00:23:13.60,00:23:13.60,- They were trying totell them something.
564,00:23:15.33,00:23:15.33,"I don't know if it was, youknow, vote for Lindsey,"
565,00:23:18.27,00:23:18.27,"she has votes, or...I don't know."
566,00:23:28.70,00:23:28.70,- I... I thinkwe need to go
567,00:23:30.53,00:23:30.53,"with the safest bet,as we've said all along."
568,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,"- I mean, we're playinghard ball now."
569,00:23:34.53,00:23:34.53,"- Yeah, that's true."
570,00:23:36.97,00:23:36.97,- We're pretty sure that
571,00:23:38.10,00:23:38.10,Brandon already has votesagainst him.
572,00:23:40.07,00:23:40.07,We suspected thatfrom the start.
573,00:23:41.73,00:23:41.73,"Knowing that Frank had beenin the same tribe with him,"
574,00:23:43.80,00:23:43.80,we figured if there was anybodythat Frank was just going to
575,00:23:46.37,00:23:46.37,throw a vote at just on
576,00:23:47.90,00:23:47.90,"principal alone, it would havebeen Brandon."
577,00:23:53.30,00:23:53.30,"- I don't know what they'rethinking, but I don't have any"
578,00:23:55.83,00:23:55.83,"votes, so I still think I havea really good chance."
579,00:23:58.90,00:23:58.90,"But if they vote for Lindsey,then it's done, she's gone."
580,00:24:01.97,00:24:01.97,"Out of the three of us, they'regonna be most likely to think"
581,00:24:04.37,00:24:04.37,"that I have a vote from Frank,you know what I mean?"
582,00:24:06.53,00:24:06.53,"- That's why they think they'resitting pretty, it's because"
583,00:24:08.60,00:24:08.60,they assumethat you have a vote.
584,00:24:09.93,00:24:09.93,- They just assume that I havea vote from Frank.
585,00:24:11.40,00:24:11.40,- Should we just votefor Tom and stick to it?
586,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,- We stick with it.
587,00:24:14.23,00:24:14.23,"That's it, period."
588,00:24:17.50,00:24:17.50,- (loud snoring)
589,00:24:20.43,00:24:20.43,- We're totally confident thatif it's a three-and-three tie
590,00:24:22.67,00:24:22.67,"against Brandon and Tom, thatBrandon can win the questions."
591,00:24:25.97,00:24:25.97,- (groaning)
592,00:24:29.70,00:24:29.70,"- I mean, Kelly, she's likea walking thesaurus, and Lex"
593,00:24:32.23,00:24:32.23,"probably is too muchof a chance, too."
594,00:24:35.20,00:24:35.20,"So we think we're going to votefor Tom, knowing that Brandon"
595,00:24:38.33,00:24:38.33,could probablybeat him in trivia.
596,00:24:39.97,00:24:39.97,"- I'm going to do it,there's just no way around it."
597,00:24:42.17,00:24:42.17,"There's no way I can lose tohim, unless it's..."
598,00:24:44.60,00:24:44.60,I can't imagine what questionthey would ask that he would
599,00:24:46.30,00:24:46.30,know and I wouldn't.
600,00:24:47.73,00:24:47.73,"I mean, I told the girls thisis what we would do."
601,00:24:49.90,00:24:49.90,I'll have to justtake a bullet for her.
602,00:24:51.93,00:24:51.93,Let's have a group hug.
603,00:24:54.07,00:24:54.07,Come here.
604,00:25:01.07,00:25:01.07,"- It looks like they're stilla little divided, so it probably"
605,00:25:03.30,00:25:03.30,will be a three-three vote ontheir side.
606,00:25:05.20,00:25:05.20,- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

815,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,"- Yeah, just think about it,we can talk after lunch."
816,00:34:17.73,00:34:17.73,"Okay, that's fine."
817,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,"- I just thought, oh, my God,if this can secure them not"
818,00:34:22.57,00:34:22.57,"voting for me, I'll do it,and this isn't cheating."
819,00:34:25.37,00:34:25.37,I'm not stickinga card up my sleeve.
820,00:34:26.97,00:34:26.97,This is just making the rightmove for myself.
821,00:34:29.50,00:34:29.50,"So what if we vote againstBrandon, then what happens?"
822,00:34:33.07,00:34:33.07,- It sounds like a kind ofa merger to me.
823,00:34:36.27,00:34:36.27,- And if we don't?
824,00:34:38.30,00:34:38.30,"- Well, if not, it's going tohurt everybody later."
825,00:34:42.93,00:34:42.93,"- They're basically sayingalign with us, we'll take you"
826,00:34:45.23,00:34:45.23,"further, and I'm just notgoing to do it."
827,00:34:47.47,00:34:47.47,I'm not comfortable with it.
828,00:34:48.80,00:34:48.80,I know Brandonwouldn't do it to me.
829,00:34:50.47,00:34:50.47,"He wouldn't do it to me,no matter what."
830,00:34:53.13,00:34:53.13,- I'm kind of in a no-winsituation.
831,00:34:56.17,00:34:56.17,"I mean, do I go against mypersonal morals and values"
832,00:34:59.80,00:34:59.80,and vote against Brandon?
833,00:35:01.63,00:35:01.63,Or do I vote with Brandon andKim and risk being the next one
834,00:35:05.63,00:35:05.63,voted out of here?
835,00:35:07.10,00:35:07.10,"I don't know what I'm going todo, and I don't think I'll know"
836,00:35:09.53,00:35:09.53,until I get to Tribal Council.
837,00:35:34.70,00:35:34.70,"- How's it going, guys?"
838,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50,First time we'vehad this configuration
839,00:35:37.77,00:35:37.77,here at TribalCouncil.
840,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"Lex, take me back to when youhad this new tribe formed."
841,00:35:43.60,00:35:43.60,How is that working out?
842,00:35:45.03,00:35:45.03,"- It was a real shocker tobegin with, but I think we've"
843,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,all acclimated pretty well.
844,00:35:48.80,00:35:48.80,"We've kind ofcome together as a tribe,"
845,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,which makes a night liketonight pretty tough.
846,00:35:53.37,00:35:53.37,"- (Probst) Brandon,at this point,"
847,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,do you trustthese other five?
848,00:35:56.90,00:35:56.90,"- I think thatas far as trust goes,"
849,00:35:59.43,00:35:59.43,you don't trust anybodyin the game.
850,00:36:01.00,00:36:01.00,"It's just, it's a fact of life,one of us has to go,"
851,00:36:03.17,00:36:03.17,"and it may be me, may besomebody else, we'll just see."
852,00:36:06.10,00:36:06.10,"- (Probst) Kim, is this gamemore ethically challenging"
853,00:36:09.00,00:36:09.00,than you anticipated?
854,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,- Yes. I think that you eitherdecide that you're going to play
855,00:36:13.73,00:36:13.73,"this for me, and I'm going toget myself to be number one and"
856,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,"as far as I can, or you decideI'm going to do this with value"
857,00:36:20.73,00:36:20.73,"and integrity and all of my ownethics, and I don't think"
858,00:36:23.70,00:36:23.70,that there'sa middle road anywhere.
859,00:36:25.23,00:36:25.23,"- (Probst) Kelly, what startedout as Samburu and Boran,"
860,00:36:28.10,00:36:28.10,are thosetribes just gone now?
861,00:36:29.70,00:36:29.70,- I wouldn't say they'rejust gone.
862,00:36:30.93,00:36:30.93,"Obviously, you know, we..."
863,00:36:32.43,00:36:32.43,"we're very close with some ofthe people that were on Boran,"
864,00:36:34.47,00:36:34.47,"and we still haveloyalties to them,"
865,00:36:35.93,00:36:35.93,but it just really opened up oureyes that these people
866,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,"are great,and it's really changed up"
867,00:36:38.57,00:36:38.57,the game in a lot of ways.
868,00:36:39.70,00:36:39.70,It's made everythinga lot harder.
869,00:36:43.30,00:36:43.30,- It's time to vote.
870,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,"Brandon,you're up first."
871,00:37:28.67,00:37:28.67,- (whispering) I hate havingto vote for this person.
872,00:37:30.90,00:37:30.90,"I'd rather vote for myself rightnow, 'cause this is miserable."
873,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80,- I'll go tally the votes.
874,00:37:58.50,00:37:58.50,"Once the votes have been read,the decision is final."
875,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,The person will be asked to
876,00:38:02.00,00:38:02.00,leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
877,00:38:04.67,00:38:04.67,I'll read the votes.
878,00:38:07.90,00:38:07.90,First vote...
879,00:38:11.53,00:38:11.53,Big Tom.
880,00:38:17.97,00:38:17.97,Big Tom.
881,00:38:25.00,00:38:25.00,Lindsey.
882,00:38:32.03,00:38:32.03,Lindsey.
883,00:38:38.50,00:38:38.50,Tom.
884,00:38:40.97,00:38:40.97,- Hey.
885,00:38:42.03,00:38:42.03,- I'm so sorry.
886,00:38:43.07,00:38:43.07,- It's okay. Stop it.
887,00:38:45.83,00:38:45.83,It's me. Go.
888,00:38:49.03,00:38:49.03,- (Probst) Lindsey.
889,00:38:52.13,00:38:52.13,"- Guys, it's a game!"
890,00:38:54.57,00:38:54.57,"- (Probst) Lindsey,where are you going?"
891,00:38:56.47,00:38:56.47,Sit it.
892,00:38:57.50,00:38:57.50,- (laughing)
893,00:38:58.93,00:38:58.93,"- (Probst) That's three votesLindsey, three votes Tom."
894,00:39:01.27,00:39:01.27,We're going to vote again.
895,00:39:02.37,00:39:02.37,- Okay.
896,00:39:03.50,00:39:03.50,"- (Probst)But before we vote,"
897,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00,I'm going to give you guysa chance to plead your case.
898,00:39:07.63,00:39:07.63,You're fighting for your life inthis game right now.
899,00:39:09.93,00:39:09.93,Be convincing.
900,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,"Tom, you first."
901,00:39:13.13,00:39:13.13,"- Well, only thing I can sayis, I'm who I am, I'm nobody"
902,00:39:17.93,00:39:17.93,"different, and I'm notgoing to change."
903,00:39:19.33,00:39:19.33,"So... that's... you got Big Tomhere, and that's the way it is."
904,00:39:24.10,00:39:24.10,"- Lindsey, obviously triballines coming into play here."
905,00:39:27.83,00:39:27.83,This is a chance for you to turnsomebody's vote around.
906,00:39:31.80,00:39:31.80,"- Um, all I really want to sayis that I came to Tribal Council"
907,00:39:35.63,00:39:35.63,"tonight thinking, um,the majority of them were going"
908,00:39:39.80,00:39:39.80,"to vote for Brandon,and I considered it."
909,00:39:42.67,00:39:42.67,I considered joining with themand voting for Brandon.
910,00:39:45.40,00:39:45.40,"And on the way here, um..."
911,00:39:48.70,00:39:48.70,(voice breaking)...my dignity took over.
912,00:39:54.27,00:39:54.27,"I don't care if I'm voted outtonight, because I didn't vote"
913,00:39:57.53,00:39:57.53,"for a friend of mine, and thatmakes me the happiest person on"
914,00:40:00.43,00:40:00.43,the face of the Earth.
915,00:40:02.00,00:40:02.00,So I'm notgoing to convince you
916,00:40:03.77,00:40:03.77,"to keep me, 'cause I'm leavingwith my pride."
917,00:40:08.23,00:40:08.23,That's all.
918,00:40:10.10,00:40:10.10,"- (Probst) Obviously, a toughvote for you guys."
919,00:40:12.30,00:40:12.30,I believe that.
920,00:40:13.53,00:40:13.53,We got to do it again.
921,00:40:15.80,00:40:15.80,"Lindsey and Tom,you won't vote this time."
922,00:40:17.47,00:40:17.47,"The other four of you will,"
923,00:40:19.13,00:40:19.13,"and you have to vote, obviously,for Tom or for Lindsey."
924,00:40:42.80,00:40:42.80,I'll go tally the votes.
925,00:40:55.03,00:40:55.03,I'll read the re-vote.
926,00:41:00.53,00:41:00.53,First vote...
927,00:41:02.57,00:41:02.57,Big Tom.
928,00:41:07.93,00:41:07.93,Tom.
929,00:41:12.57,00:41:12.57,Lindsey.
930,00:41:20.40,00:41:20.40,And we're deadlocked.
931,00:41:25.53,00:41:25.53,"Well, as you guys know, TribalCouncil is a place where you"
932,00:41:29.27,00:41:29.27,account for your actions.
933,00:41:30.50,00:41:30.50,"In the case of a deadlock,"
934,00:41:31.63,00:41:31.63,we go to votes cast at previousTribal Councils.
935,00:41:34.60,00:41:34.60,"Tom, how many votes haveyou had cast against you?"
936,00:41:37.33,00:41:37.33,- None that I know of.
937,00:41:38.80,00:41:38.80,- (Probst) Lindsey?
938,00:41:39.87,00:41:39.87,- A couple.
939,00:41:40.93,00:41:40.93,- (Probst) Four?
940,00:41:41.93,00:41:41.93,- Maybe.
941,00:41:43.17,00:41:43.17,- (Probst)That's enough.
942,00:41:44.43,00:41:44.43,You need to bring meyour torch.
943,00:41:46.37,00:41:46.37,"- Oh, stop it."
944,00:41:48.90,00:41:48.90,(speaking inaudibly)
945,00:41:56.23,00:41:56.23,It's okay.
946,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,"It's a game, guys."
947,00:42:00.13,00:42:00.13,You're the best.
948,00:42:01.97,00:42:01.97,"- I love you, too."
949,00:42:10.03,00:42:10.03,"- Lindsey,the tribe has spoken."
950,00:42:17.10,00:42:17.10,It's time for you to go.
951,00:42:18.13,00:42:18.13,Good night.
952,00:42:19.13,00:42:19.13,- Bye.
953,00:42:20.47,00:42:20.47,- We'll miss you.
954,00:42:25.87,00:42:25.87,"- Well, clearly, in spite ofwhat was said tonight,"
955,00:42:28.17,00:42:28.17,"tribal lines still playing a bigpart, because this was the most"
956,00:42:30.90,00:42:30.90,emotional Tribal Council I thinkwe've ever had.
957,00:42:34.03,00:42:34.03,You guys canhead back to camp.
958,00:42:51.40,00:42:51.40,Stay tuned for scenes from ournext episode.
959,00:42:58.13,00:42:58.13,- (Probst) Next time on  Survivor...
960,00:42:59.93,00:42:59.93,"The tribes eagerly anticipatethe traditional merge,"
961,00:43:02.27,00:43:02.27,but anxieties run high.
962,00:43:03.83,00:43:03.83,- It is absolutelyhorrible.
963,00:43:06.97,00:43:06.97,- (Probst) Because no one knowshow or when it will happen.
964,00:43:10.13,00:43:10.13,- Kind of likestanding on a corner
965,00:43:11.50,00:43:11.50,and the bus didn'tcome by.
966,00:43:12.80,00:43:12.80,"- Wake up, wake up."
967,00:43:13.90,00:43:13.90,"Yo, we got mail."
968,00:43:14.97,00:43:14.97,It is bigand it is nasty.
969,00:43:23.07,00:43:23.07,- Tonight's vote was asurprise.
970,00:43:24.50,00:43:24.50,I thought that theywould vote for Brandon.
971,00:43:26.27,00:43:26.27,"I honestly don't think I couldhave gone on much longer,"
972,00:43:28.33,00:43:28.33,because this game is a seriousemotional roller coaster ride.
973,00:43:31.87,00:43:31.87,"And, you know, I'm an athlete,but I'd much rather do it in a"
974,00:43:35.23,00:43:35.23,"civilized environment, where I'mnot battling malicious behavior."
975,00:43:38.57,00:43:38.57,I don't like that aspectof this game at all.
976,00:43:41.00,00:43:41.00,See you on the dark side.
