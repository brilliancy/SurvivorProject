1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: We are off the
2,00:00:12.46,00:00:12.46,coast of Panama on a remote island that will play a dramatic
3,00:00:15.71,00:00:15.71,role in the lives of our 16 survivors over the next 39 days.
4,00:00:20.12,00:00:20.12,"This is Exile Island. Each week, at least one survivor"
5,00:00:31.08,00:00:31.08,"will be banished here, separated from their tribe-- they'll have"
6,00:00:34.21,00:00:34.21,no idea what's going on back at camp-- and they'll be forced to
7,00:00:37.08,00:00:37.08,live on their own until they return to the game.
8,00:00:41.33,00:00:41.33,But there is a silver lining to Exile Island: it's a mystery
9,00:00:44.92,00:00:44.92,that could help one of our survivors win the million
10,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83,dollars and the title of sole survivor.
11,00:00:50.67,00:00:50.67,"It's a twist like never before, turning strategy on its head."
12,00:00:55.42,00:00:55.42,These 16 Americans have already begun the adventure of a
13,00:00:58.71,00:00:58.71,lifetime. They have been divided into four
14,00:01:02.62,00:01:02.62,"tribes, each with four members. They are strangers from"
15,00:01:06.50,00:01:06.50,"different walks of life, forced to work together to create a new"
16,00:01:09.75,00:01:09.75,society while battling the elements and each other.
17,00:01:14.04,00:01:14.04,They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted from the tribe.
18,00:01:17.29,00:01:17.29,"In the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar"
19,00:01:20.12,00:01:20.12,"prize. 39 days, 16 people, one..."
20,00:01:27.54,00:01:27.54,survivor.  Captioning sponsored by

22,00:02:34.38,00:02:34.38,"Come on in, guys. Welcome to Survivor."
23,00:02:56.88,00:02:56.88,"Cirie, what do you think about the way you've been divided?"
24,00:02:59.96,00:02:59.96,"First reaction. >> It looks like younger, older."
25,00:03:04.38,00:03:04.38,">> PROBST: Shane, is that what it's sizing up to you?"
26,00:03:07.50,00:03:07.50,">> Yeah, I mean, genders and ages separated, the four of us."
27,00:03:10.42,00:03:10.42,"I mean, it will be interesting. I don't think this has ever"
28,00:03:13.04,00:03:13.04,happened before. >> PROBST: Shane's right.
29,00:03:15.25,00:03:15.25,"For the first time ever, you have been divided into four"
30,00:03:18.54,00:03:18.54,tribes by age and gender: Younger men versus younger women
31,00:03:24.88,00:03:24.88,versus the older men versus the older women.
32,00:03:28.67,00:03:28.67,>> Uh... I thought I was young. W-W-W-W-W-W--
33,00:03:32.96,00:03:32.96,(laughing): I'm on the wrong team.
34,00:03:36.17,00:03:36.17,Why do they think I'm older? Do I look older?
35,00:03:38.83,00:03:38.83,(older women laughing) >> I would certainly prefer to
36,00:03:42.29,00:03:42.29,"have some females on our team. My personality, I can't help but"
37,00:03:46.71,00:03:46.71,"flirt with, you know, basically any female I come into contact"
38,00:03:50.38,00:03:50.38,with. >> There was the young beefcake
39,00:03:53.83,00:03:53.83,"crowd, of which I was the charter member and president,"
40,00:03:56.42,00:03:56.42,"and then there was the Love Boat crowd, which was the older men,"
41,00:03:59.04,00:03:59.04,and there was the Golden Girls and then there was the Spice
42,00:04:01.79,00:04:01.79,Girls. It will be interesting to see
43,00:04:03.50,00:04:03.50,how things shake out. >> PROBST: Let me tell you a
44,00:04:05.46,00:04:05.46,little bit about the island you're on right now.
45,00:04:07.83,00:04:07.83,"You will not be living here as tribes, but over the next 39"
46,00:04:12.25,00:04:12.25,"days, many of you will be spending some time out here"
47,00:04:15.75,00:04:15.75,alone. This is Exile Island.
48,00:04:20.21,00:04:20.21,"Throughout this game, tribe members will be banished to this"
49,00:04:23.25,00:04:23.25,"island, where you will have to live with very meager supplies,"
50,00:04:27.00,00:04:27.00,"dealing with all the elements, with nobody to watch your back."
51,00:04:29.83,00:04:29.83,"And even worse, when you're on Exile Island, you are not back"
52,00:04:33.00,00:04:33.00,at your camp. You are out of the loop and you
53,00:04:36.04,00:04:36.04,don't know what is going on. Now I've got another surprise.
54,00:04:41.12,00:04:41.12,"You're going to compete, right now, in your first reward"
55,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,challenge. >> Yeah.
56,00:04:46.58,00:04:46.58,>> Let's get it on. >> I was just pumped that we had
57,00:04:49.04,00:04:49.04,"a challenge right off the bat. I mean, that's my forte, that's"
58,00:04:51.04,00:04:51.04,"my thing. I'm an athlete, you know, I'm"
59,00:04:53.08,00:04:53.08,physical. That's what I came here for.
60,00:04:57.54,00:04:57.54,">> PROBST: All right, each tribe will choose one person to run"
61,00:04:59.96,00:04:59.96,"for them. On my go, you will race to the"
62,00:05:02.21,00:05:02.21,"other end of the island, where you will find a pile of skulls."
63,00:05:05.58,00:05:05.58,"Taking one skull at a time, smash it on a rock."
64,00:05:09.46,00:05:09.46,"Inside, you'll find a tightly wrapped ball of fabric."
65,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,"Untie it. You're looking for an amulet,"
66,00:05:15.50,00:05:15.50,"not a stone. Once you find an amulet, race"
67,00:05:18.50,00:05:18.50,back to the finish. The first three tribe members
68,00:05:21.21,00:05:21.21,"back with an amulet win, for their tribe, fire in the form of"
69,00:05:25.21,00:05:25.21,"flint. In addition, the losing tribe"
70,00:05:28.54,00:05:28.54,"will choose one person to stay behind on Exile Island, right"
71,00:05:35.12,00:05:35.12,off the bat. >> (whistling): Wow.
72,00:05:37.54,00:05:37.54,>> PROBST: Big enough stakes? >> Yeah.
73,00:05:39.67,00:05:39.67,">> Oh, yeah. >> Definitely."
74,00:05:40.46,00:05:40.46,">> PROBST: All right, I know you don't know each other very well,"
75,00:05:42.29,00:05:42.29,but you got to make a decision. I'll give you a second to
76,00:05:44.29,00:05:44.29,strategize. Who is going to run?
77,00:05:46.12,00:05:46.12,(all talking indistinctly) >> PROBST: All right.
78,00:05:53.67,00:05:53.67,"Older Women, who's going to run the challenge?"
79,00:05:56.42,00:05:56.42,">> Ruth-Marie. >> PROBST: Older guys, who's it"
80,00:05:58.46,00:05:58.46,going to be? >> Terry.
81,00:05:59.42,00:05:59.42,>> PROBST: For the younger women?
82,00:06:00.50,00:06:00.50,>> Danielle. >> PROBST: How about for the
83,00:06:01.71,00:06:01.71,younger guys? >> Austin.
84,00:06:03.25,00:06:03.25,">> PROBST: Austin, Danielle, Terry, Ruth-Marie, come up to"
85,00:06:06.04,00:06:06.04,"the start. >> Let's go, Terry."
86,00:06:08.00,00:06:08.00,>> Look for the amulet. Look for the amulet.
87,00:06:11.38,00:06:11.38,>> PROBST: For reward in the form of fire.
88,00:06:15.17,00:06:15.17,Survivors ready. Go!
89,00:06:18.50,00:06:18.50,(all shouting) Austin down already.
90,00:06:21.50,00:06:21.50,"Gotta get those jitters out. >> Let's go, Terry."
91,00:06:53.04,00:06:53.04,>> (whispering): I hope she can pound it.
92,00:07:09.21,00:07:09.21,">> PROBST: Here comes somebody. >> Let's go, Terry!"
93,00:07:14.42,00:07:14.42,"Yeah, Terry! >> PROBST: Terry back first, for"
94,00:07:17.25,00:07:17.25,the older guys. Only two amulets remaining.
95,00:07:19.42,00:07:19.42,(whooping) >> Yeah!
96,00:07:28.83,00:07:28.83,>> There he is. >> Austin!
97,00:07:32.62,00:07:32.62,>> PROBST: Austin back with the second amulet for the younger
98,00:07:35.42,00:07:35.42,"guys. >> My boy, that's my boy."
99,00:07:38.25,00:07:38.25,">> PROBST: Older women, younger women, getting nervous?"
100,00:07:41.62,00:07:41.62,Nobody wants to stay behind here.
101,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,>> She's not a smasher. >> God is gonna help her.
102,00:07:53.88,00:07:53.88,>> I just can't breathe until I see her come up here.
103,00:08:01.12,00:08:01.12,">> Come on, Ruth, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come"
104,00:08:05.21,00:08:05.21,"on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
105,00:08:15.08,00:08:15.08,>> PROBST: Here comes the final amulet.
106,00:08:17.79,00:08:17.79,"I don't know who's got it. >> Lord, please let it be"
107,00:08:21.25,00:08:21.25,Ruth-Marie. >> PROBST: Ruth-Marie back with
108,00:08:29.46,00:08:29.46,the final amulet for the older women!
109,00:08:32.50,00:08:32.50,"Older women, older men, younger men all have amulets."
110,00:08:36.62,00:08:36.62,">> That's good, that's good, that's great, you did it."
111,00:08:40.83,00:08:40.83,>> PROBST: Here she comes. (applause)
112,00:08:49.67,00:08:49.67,"For the young men, fire. For the older guys, fire."
113,00:08:53.67,00:08:53.67,The older women-- Ruth-Marie. >> Yay!
114,00:08:55.88,00:08:55.88,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: For the younger
115,00:08:58.33,00:08:58.33,"women, big disadvantage right off the bat-- no fire, and the"
116,00:09:03.50,00:09:03.50,worst news is you got to give me a name now.
117,00:09:06.58,00:09:06.58,Who is going to stay behind at Exile Island?
118,00:09:10.96,00:09:10.96,>> I'll stay. >> Uh-uh.
119,00:09:12.58,00:09:12.58,">> You shouldn't have to. >> I said, you know, ""I lost the"
120,00:09:16.08,00:09:16.08,"challenge, I feel like I should stay,"" and then the other girls"
121,00:09:19.00,00:09:19.00,"were like, ""No, no, no, you can't."
122,00:09:21.08,00:09:21.08,"You just did the challenge."" You know, they were really cool"
123,00:09:23.25,00:09:23.25,"about it. >> Should we, like, pick up"
124,00:09:25.25,00:09:25.25,sticks or something? Whoever gets the shortest?
125,00:09:27.33,00:09:27.33,">> Rock, paper, scissors? >> That sounds great."
126,00:09:30.08,00:09:30.08,">> Can we do rock, paper, scissors?"
127,00:09:32.08,00:09:32.08,>> PROBST: You can do whatever you want.
128,00:09:34.75,00:09:34.75,(talking indistinctly) >> No one really wanted to make
129,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,a decision in our group. The whole time I'm holding my
130,00:09:41.25,00:09:41.25,"breath. I'm thinking, ""Please, God, I"
131,00:09:43.08,00:09:43.08,"don't want to start off Survivor on the losing end."""
132,00:09:48.08,00:09:48.08,">> One, two, three, hit-- ready? >> All right, I'm here."
133,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,"But, you know, I'm the one who got stuck sitting on Exile"
134,00:09:56.38,00:09:56.38,Island. >> PROBST: Misty is sticking
135,00:09:58.46,00:09:58.46,behind. >> I'm staying.
136,00:09:59.71,00:09:59.71,>> PROBST: Here's how it's going to work.
137,00:10:01.79,00:10:01.79,"You will stay here until the first immunity challenge, at"
138,00:10:04.08,00:10:04.08,"which point, you will return back to your tribe."
139,00:10:06.96,00:10:06.96,You will compete. There's one other element to
140,00:10:09.83,00:10:09.83,Exile Island. Hidden somewhere on this island
141,00:10:14.42,00:10:14.42,is an immunity idol. >> Ooh-hoo.
142,00:10:17.25,00:10:17.25,>> PROBST: So while you're out here trying to figure out how to
143,00:10:20.42,00:10:20.42,"survive, you ought to be looking for it."
144,00:10:22.42,00:10:22.42,"If you find the idol, you can share that information with"
145,00:10:25.33,00:10:25.33,whoever you want. You can keep it a secret.
146,00:10:27.50,00:10:27.50,It's up to you. The important thing to remember
147,00:10:30.17,00:10:30.17,"is that you can use it anytime, up through the final four, but"
148,00:10:34.04,00:10:34.04,"once there are only three of you remaining, the idol can be used"
149,00:10:37.42,00:10:37.42,no more. But here's the best part: you
150,00:10:40.50,00:10:40.50,can hold on to that idol until after the votes have been
151,00:10:44.75,00:10:44.75,revealed at Tribal Council. That means you could have enough
152,00:10:48.04,00:10:48.04,"votes to get you voted out, you hold up that idol, you are now"
153,00:10:51.71,00:10:51.71,"immune, and the person with the next most votes goes home."
154,00:10:57.79,00:10:57.79,It is a huge shift in how this game is played.
155,00:11:02.21,00:11:02.21,"Along the way, you'll be given clues as to the whereabouts of"
156,00:11:05.33,00:11:05.33,"that idol. Younger Guys, get out of here."
157,00:11:08.79,00:11:08.79,Here's a map. Let's go.
158,00:11:11.04,00:11:11.04,"Older Guys, here's a map to your beach."
159,00:11:13.75,00:11:13.75,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Have fun.
160,00:11:15.33,00:11:15.33,>> All righty. >> PROBST: Older Women.
161,00:11:17.04,00:11:17.04,"(whooping) Sally, Danielle, Courtney,"
162,00:11:21.00,00:11:21.00,here's a map to your beach. The boat is waiting to take you
163,00:11:25.25,00:11:25.25,"there. All right, Misty."
164,00:11:36.83,00:11:36.83,"Tough way to start the game. A few minutes in, you're"
165,00:11:39.17,00:11:39.17,already left on your own. Here's what you have on Exile
166,00:11:42.21,00:11:42.21,"Island: one machete, one bucket of water."
167,00:11:45.54,00:11:45.54,"Water not going to do you a lot of get good, 'cause you really"
168,00:11:48.17,00:11:48.17,"need to boil it before you drink it, and you don't have fire."
169,00:11:51.29,00:11:51.29,You also have a lot of time to think about why fate chose you
170,00:11:57.75,00:11:57.75,"to be the first one out here, which is also why immunity is"
171,00:12:02.29,00:12:02.29,already so important. And as for your first clue to
172,00:12:05.29,00:12:05.29,"the whereabouts, I've already given it to you."
173,00:12:08.12,00:12:08.12,Good luck. See you at the immunity
174,00:12:10.21,00:12:10.21,"challenge. >> Nice work out there, buddy."
175,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,>> Uh-huh! (yelling like Tarzan)
176,00:12:37.21,00:12:37.21,>> Where's the map? Who's got the map?
177,00:12:54.04,00:12:54.04,>> I am the first person exiled to Exile Island.
178,00:12:58.38,00:12:58.38,I definitely feel very vulnerable.
179,00:13:01.42,00:13:01.42,"I didn't expect this, this soon, this early, so it came as"
180,00:13:04.96,00:13:04.96,"quite a shock. Think, Misty, think."
181,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,"Jeff did say there's an immunity idol on the island, and he left"
182,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50,"me with clues. He said, ""Why did fate leave"
183,00:13:14.50,00:13:14.50,"you behind?"" Behind me."
184,00:13:17.75,00:13:17.75,It seems to me like he was trying to tell us that the
185,00:13:20.08,00:13:20.08,"immunity idol was buried behind us, where we were standing."
186,00:13:24.25,00:13:24.25,"That was my guess, anyways. Behind me."
187,00:13:30.33,00:13:30.33,I'm going to be definitely searching for that immunity

191,00:13:51.21,00:13:51.21,The machete kind of scared me a little bit.
192,00:13:53.75,00:13:53.75,I thought we might have to clear an area to build a house or
193,00:13:56.83,00:13:56.83,something. And clearing areas kind of
194,00:13:59.71,00:13:59.71,"scares me, because when you clear the area, the things that"
195,00:14:02.12,00:14:02.12,"used to live there come out, and I'm not good with things."
196,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,>> And bless our team. Bless everyone here...

228,00:15:54.42,00:15:54.42,"a lot of outdoor experience. Heck, we went to gather leaves"

244,00:16:49.25,00:16:49.25,"All right, so right now, I want you guys just to think, right"
245,00:16:51.38,00:16:51.38,"now, what we're going to do. We're going to make fire."
246,00:16:53.25,00:16:53.25,>> Okay. >> Okay.

257,00:17:23.17,00:17:23.17,"Like, we need to worry about basics."
258,00:17:24.75,00:17:24.75,>> Use that power in the hand. You got it.
259,00:17:26.79,00:17:26.79,>> Brace yourself. >> Think about this thing and
260,00:17:28.88,00:17:28.88,catching it. Okay. (clanging)
261,00:17:33.92,00:17:33.92,">> Oh, my hand. >> Keep the faith."
262,00:17:38.17,00:17:38.17,"Keep the faith, fellas. >> I mean, is there something"
263,00:17:40.42,00:17:40.42,we're just missing? Like some component of

269,00:17:57.21,00:17:57.21,(clicks tongue) We don't have a clue what we
270,00:17:59.50,00:17:59.50,are doing. (laughs)
271,00:18:02.42,00:18:02.42,"That's the shelter right there, gentlemen."
272,00:18:04.75,00:18:04.75,>> Look at that. >> (chuckling): Yeah.
273,00:18:06.62,00:18:06.62,>> Where's Bob Vila when you need him?
274,00:18:08.21,00:18:08.21,>> That is the sorriest shelter I think we could have
275,00:18:10.12,00:18:10.12,possibly come up with. >> Possibly.
276,00:18:11.79,00:18:11.79,">> Got to be proud of it. First night, you know?"
277,00:18:13.79,00:18:13.79,We wouldn't want to peak the first night.
278,00:18:15.79,00:18:15.79,>> Let's just hope it doesn't rain.
279,00:18:17.79,00:18:17.79,"Right now, it's not. (birds calling)"
280,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,">> Oh, this is kind of cool, too, this little... story."
281,00:18:30.42,00:18:30.42,>> We could do a lean-to. >> Yeah.
282,00:18:33.25,00:18:33.25,"We could... and it's flat. >> Well, there are so many"
283,00:18:38.21,00:18:38.21,places. I don't know.
284,00:18:40.08,00:18:40.08,We should keep looking. Don't you think?
285,00:18:42.08,00:18:42.08,>> What would Misty like? (laughing): What would...
286,00:18:44.96,00:18:44.96,>> It hasn't been the greatest day for us.
287,00:18:47.17,00:18:47.17,"We started off, like, you know, underdogs."
288,00:18:50.08,00:18:50.08,"Plus, you know, since we didn't win the flint and, everyone else"
289,00:18:53.29,00:18:53.29,"did, we don't have fire, and don't have water."
290,00:18:56.04,00:18:56.04,"And we only have three of us, so..."
291,00:18:58.75,00:18:58.75,And none of us has ever made a shelter before.
292,00:19:01.46,00:19:01.46,"It's such a cool tree, huh? It seems like we could do"
293,00:19:04.29,00:19:04.29,something with this. >> I don't know.
294,00:19:06.62,00:19:06.62,>> I don't know. >> I'm-I'm not...
295,00:19:08.58,00:19:08.58,Are you feeling it? >> No.
296,00:19:10.29,00:19:10.29,(laughter) >> Nope... Next!
297,00:19:13.08,00:19:13.08,>> I'm just kidding. >> We are so back-and-forth
298,00:19:16.38,00:19:16.38,about where to pick our shelter. We were being women:
299,00:19:19.17,00:19:19.17,"""Huh. Do you think this will work?"""
300,00:19:21.50,00:19:21.50,"""I don't know. What do you think?"""
301,00:19:23.33,00:19:23.33,"""I don't know. Is purple my color?"""
302,00:19:26.08,00:19:26.08,Hmm. Uh...
303,00:19:30.75,00:19:30.75,>> Do you want to keep walking? Other options?
304,00:19:33.12,00:19:33.12,">> I-I'm happy walking, just checking out where we're living,"
305,00:19:35.08,00:19:35.08,"just for fun. >> All right, let's check it"
306,00:19:36.46,00:19:36.46,out. I started to get a little bit
307,00:19:38.42,00:19:38.42,"frustrated with the whole, like, where we should do the shelter."
308,00:19:41.58,00:19:41.58,"If you see it and you like it, don't even look any more,"
309,00:19:44.12,00:19:44.12,because it's just a waste of time at that point.
310,00:19:46.21,00:19:46.21,"It's starting to get dark. >> Oh, man!"
311,00:19:49.33,00:19:49.33,"How old this guy is. Oh, man!"
312,00:19:54.50,00:19:54.50,"Dead, on this little beach. Come on."
313,00:19:59.08,00:19:59.08,"That's-That's really weird, huh? Oh, we love you."
314,00:20:08.08,00:20:08.08,"I thought it was really ironic that the turtle, that"
315,00:20:11.62,00:20:11.62,"represents, like, mother and goddess and, like, Native"
316,00:20:14.04,00:20:14.04,"American culture, and, that like, this is the island where"
317,00:20:16.25,00:20:16.25,"three women, you know, are living on."
318,00:20:19.71,00:20:19.71,"It just to me, it just seemed really significant."
319,00:20:22.83,00:20:22.83,"I mean, they're just, like, such a symbol."
320,00:20:25.58,00:20:25.58,"Like, the turtle is Mother Earth."
321,00:20:27.62,00:20:27.62,"Even more specifically, North America is called Turtle Island."
322,00:20:32.25,00:20:32.25,>> Courtney's kind of just so out there.
323,00:20:35.79,00:20:35.79,She had all this symbolism for a dead sea turtle.
324,00:20:38.08,00:20:38.08,"To me, it's just a turtle. I cannot fake that I'm, like,"
325,00:20:41.83,00:20:41.83,deep into this. >> Should we just...
326,00:20:44.96,00:20:44.96,">> I don't... I don't know. I'm thinking about high tide,"
327,00:20:46.75,00:20:46.75,"just, like, rolling her back in the ocean or something."
328,00:20:49.92,00:20:49.92,>> Rolling it back in the ocean? >> Yeah.
329,00:20:53.08,00:20:53.08,">> I think Courtney... she overdramatizes things, I"
330,00:20:56.79,00:20:56.79,"believe, which is not needed. We need to, you know,"
331,00:20:59.79,00:20:59.79,"build a shelter, catch food, build a fire."
332,00:21:03.08,00:21:03.08,">> Oh, my gosh. It just freaks me out, man."
333,00:21:05.88,00:21:05.88,>> There's so much to do and so little time to do it.
334,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,(birds singing) (grunting)
335,00:21:22.21,00:21:22.21,">> All right, Bruce. (grunting)"
336,00:21:26.42,00:21:26.42,>> Some I already cut. >> Awesome!
337,00:21:29.67,00:21:29.67,>> We're feeling really good because we got our fire and
338,00:21:32.42,00:21:32.42,boiling water. You see any other smoke on any
339,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,of the other islands? >> Let's make a rally up into
340,00:21:37.67,00:21:37.67,"the thing and get some really dry wood, 'cause we're putting"
341,00:21:39.75,00:21:39.75,wet wood on the deal. >> Okay.
342,00:21:41.50,00:21:41.50,">> We're stoked. We're Older Guys, and we're"
343,00:21:43.38,00:21:43.38,"into this, and we're doing the Boy Scout thing right now."
344,00:21:45.71,00:21:45.71,That's the best-smelling stinking fire I've seen in a
345,00:21:47.62,00:21:47.62,"long time. When people come over here, if"
346,00:21:50.92,00:21:50.92,"they do, they're going to see a roaring fire, and they're going"
347,00:21:53.25,00:21:53.25,to see some shrimp on the barbie.
348,00:21:59.12,00:21:59.12,>> Can I trust you? >> Yeah.
349,00:22:02.25,00:22:02.25,Yeah. >> I'll never lie to you.
350,00:22:04.71,00:22:04.71,>> Okay. >> And I expect you to never lie
351,00:22:06.71,00:22:06.71,to me. >> I'll shake on that.
352,00:22:08.71,00:22:08.71,>> Yeah? >> Yeah.
353,00:22:10.71,00:22:10.71,">> All right, we'll never lie to each other."
354,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,>> No matter what. >> All right.
355,00:22:25.12,00:22:25.12,>> Really? >> Yeah.
356,00:22:26.75,00:22:26.75,So... >> That's awesome!
357,00:22:28.38,00:22:28.38,">> Yeah. >> Well, I did do, do a little"
358,00:22:30.79,00:22:30.79,"white lie to you. You know I am, you know, I'm an"
359,00:22:33.04,00:22:33.04,American Airlines pilot... >> Yeah.
360,00:22:35.04,00:22:35.04,>> ... but I-I didn't want people knowing the military
361,00:22:37.08,00:22:37.08,"thing. Uh, yeah, I flew F-14s."
362,00:22:39.50,00:22:39.50,Aircraft carriers. >> Terry's a great guy.
363,00:22:42.12,00:22:42.12,"I found out he was a military pilot, flew F-14s."
364,00:22:45.62,00:22:45.62,My background is that I retired from NASA as an astronaut.
365,00:22:49.08,00:22:49.08,There are some similarities between the expedition to space
366,00:22:51.33,00:22:51.33,and the expedition to a deserted island.
367,00:22:54.21,00:22:54.21,The teamwork concept is very much alive on this island.
368,00:23:03.08,00:23:03.08,">> By the way, I'm getting chewed to death right now."
369,00:23:07.08,00:23:07.08,"I don't know if they're in the sand, but..."
370,00:23:10.71,00:23:10.71,">> Let's get all these back first, and don't waste a lot of"
371,00:23:13.38,00:23:13.38,energy on one. >> We're coming!
372,00:23:15.38,00:23:15.38,>> I already want to start calling people out because
373,00:23:17.21,00:23:17.21,they're moronic. >> Come on!

375,00:23:21.54,00:23:21.54,"fit in with them all that much, and they just want to work all"
376,00:23:25.38,00:23:25.38,"the time, and I'm exhausted. I haven't had a cigarette."
377,00:23:28.00,00:23:28.00,"You know, I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day for 20 years,"
378,00:23:31.83,00:23:31.83,"and I haven't had a cigarette in like, 31 hours."
379,00:23:35.21,00:23:35.21,"I mean, I'm just at the end of my rope."
380,00:23:37.71,00:23:37.71,"I'm fried. Yo, man, we also got to stop"
381,00:23:40.42,00:23:40.42,worrying about hurting people's feelings at this point.
382,00:23:43.71,00:23:43.71,"Like, we're here. All four of us don't need to"
383,00:23:45.79,00:23:45.79,get the water. All four of us don't need to
384,00:23:47.88,00:23:47.88,head to the path to find the mud chute.

388,00:23:59.08,00:23:59.08,I left it there. >> What's Daffy Duck doing over

391,00:24:07.21,00:24:07.21,"detox for sure, the cigarette stuff."
392,00:24:09.75,00:24:09.75,It's... I can't lash out at anybody.
393,00:24:13.88,00:24:13.88,"I can't, I can't, I can't. It is unbelievably hard."
394,00:24:16.96,00:24:16.96,And I've been here a day. >> Woo-hoo!
395,00:24:34.79,00:24:34.79,(thunder rumbling) >> Spending the night on Exile
396,00:24:58.21,00:24:58.21,Island was my worst nightmare. I'm tired.
397,00:25:02.58,00:25:02.58,"I'm hungry. I'm really, really, really"
398,00:25:04.58,00:25:04.58,thirsty. Protein...
399,00:25:11.12,00:25:11.12,"My tribe mates, the three of them hopefully are doing better"
400,00:25:14.21,00:25:14.21,"than me, so they're strong for our next immunity challenge."
401,00:25:16.54,00:25:16.54,"But, uh, I definitely feel at a huge disadvantage."
402,00:25:20.33,00:25:20.33,And I'm the first one voted off should we not win.
403,00:25:23.71,00:25:23.71,"So, I have been digging around, because Jeff mentioned that"
404,00:25:27.71,00:25:27.71,whoever finds the immunity idol on Exile Island doesn't have to
405,00:25:31.62,00:25:31.62,"tell anyone else. Well, I think that's going to be"
406,00:25:34.33,00:25:34.33,"a huge advantage, and I definitely want to use it."
407,00:25:36.62,00:25:36.62,"So when I see my tribe mates at the next immunity challenge,"
408,00:25:40.08,00:25:40.08,I'll trick them into thinking that I found the immunity idol.
409,00:25:54.17,00:25:54.17,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Misty,"
410,00:26:11.38,00:26:11.38,returning from her stay on Exile Island.

412,00:26:21.83,00:26:21.83,">> PROBST: So, Misty, how's Exile Island?"
413,00:26:24.62,00:26:24.62,">> It's been lonely, but it has its advantages."
414,00:26:27.12,00:26:27.12,>> PROBST: What advantages does Exile Island have?
415,00:26:29.04,00:26:29.04,">> Well, you told us there was an immunity idol in there, and"
416,00:26:31.62,00:26:31.62,"you told us where it was, so... >> PROBST: So you spent a little"
417,00:26:34.96,00:26:34.96,time looking for it. >> Enough.
418,00:26:39.54,00:26:39.54,">> PROBST: Okay, well, in this game, there is nothing more"
419,00:26:42.08,00:26:42.08,powerful than what? >> Immunity.
420,00:26:45.04,00:26:45.04,>> PROBST: Immunity. This is what you're playing for.
421,00:26:48.96,00:26:48.96,">> Yeah, baby! >> Yeah!"
422,00:26:49.88,00:26:49.88,>> PROBST: This is the immunity idol.
423,00:26:51.62,00:26:51.62,"There are three pieces to it because at today's challenge,"
424,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83,three tribes will win immunity. The losing tribe goes to Tribal
425,00:26:59.21,00:26:59.21,"Council tonight, the first person will be voted out of this"
426,00:27:01.54,00:27:01.54,game. Today's challenge is going to
427,00:27:04.50,00:27:04.50,test you physically. It is also going to test you
428,00:27:07.04,00:27:07.04,mentally. Here's how it works: all four
429,00:27:09.12,00:27:09.12,tribe members will start on the dock.
430,00:27:11.62,00:27:11.62,"On my ""go,"" climb up and over a barrier, swim out to your raft."
431,00:27:15.17,00:27:15.17,The raft is attached to a clip underwater.
432,00:27:18.79,00:27:18.79,"Once you've released the raft, start paddling to shore."
433,00:27:21.46,00:27:21.46,You'll then race up the beach where you have to solve a
434,00:27:25.04,00:27:25.04,brainteaser. Your goal at the brainteaser is
435,00:27:27.33,00:27:27.33,to release a metal ring from the rope.
436,00:27:30.21,00:27:30.21,Buried in the sand is a diagram to help you.
437,00:27:33.33,00:27:33.33,Your dilemma is whether you choose spend the time digging
438,00:27:36.04,00:27:36.04,that diagram up or solving the puzzle on your own.
439,00:27:39.79,00:27:39.79,"Once you release the metal ring, you'll toss the ring out,"
440,00:27:42.62,00:27:42.62,retrieve a grappling hook. When you pull on the grappling
441,00:27:45.25,00:27:45.25,hook it drops a flag. The first three tribes to drop
442,00:27:48.33,00:27:48.33,"their flag win immunity. Losing tribe, Tribal Council."
443,00:27:52.12,00:27:52.12,Make sense? >> Yeah.
444,00:27:53.42,00:27:53.42,">> PROBST: Swim out, we'll get going."
445,00:27:56.46,00:27:56.46,"Here we go, for immunity, survivors ready!"
446,00:28:02.17,00:28:02.17,"Go! Up and over, one at a time."
447,00:28:26.33,00:28:26.33,Everybody over. Tina bringing it up for the
448,00:28:29.21,00:28:29.21,older women. Now you've got to get down and
449,00:28:32.12,00:28:32.12,unhook those rafts. >> Go!
450,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,>> PROBST: Older men are the first ones free.
451,00:28:47.17,00:28:47.17,"Younger women right behind. >> Oh, my God."

456,00:29:20.08,00:29:20.08,their boat! Younger guys still trying to get
457,00:29:25.79,00:29:25.79,that rope free. Everybody following the lead of
458,00:29:29.21,00:29:29.21,the younger women. Young guys in serious trouble.
459,00:29:35.17,00:29:35.17,Still cannot get it free. They're swapping out.

462,00:29:49.75,00:29:49.75,free. All four tribes paddling to
463,00:29:52.17,00:29:52.17,"shore. >> Back, paddle back, backwards,"
464,00:29:55.12,00:29:55.12,"keep going backwards, you're steering us."
465,00:29:57.38,00:29:57.38,>> Got it. >> PROBST: Young women are first
466,00:29:59.17,00:29:59.17,back to the beach. Moving on to the brainteaser.

519,00:32:44.17,00:32:44.17,Maybe it has a little more spiritual power.

521,00:32:50.00,00:32:50.00,the four of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure

527,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,now... from our tribe. I'm really nervous.
528,00:33:32.92,00:33:32.92,I don't feel like I'm the most physically fit person on the
529,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,tribe. I don't want to be the first one

534,00:34:16.96,00:34:16.96,And he was just 16 years old... and he was my only child.
535,00:34:23.88,00:34:23.88,I am sad... because I miss him.
536,00:34:29.46,00:34:29.46,But I would like to keep that to myself for now.

542,00:35:20.88,00:35:20.88,of the lumberjack lady. >> And I think Tina's starting
543,00:35:28.92,00:35:28.92,"to aggravate her, just a little bit."
544,00:35:31.12,00:35:31.12,"Because she was like, ""I mean, I really like her, but she is kind"

546,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,That's a fish. That thing is breathing.

561,00:36:31.25,00:36:31.25,gazillion reasons to keep her. >> Let's go clean it.
562,00:36:34.71,00:36:34.71,>> We're going to fry him up. >> I do think that Cirie's the
563,00:36:37.58,00:36:37.58,weak link right now. >> Do you want to do it?
564,00:36:41.75,00:36:41.75,"Go ahead and do it. >> That's a big fish, you guys."
565,00:36:46.04,00:36:46.04,>> Slippery sucker. I scaled the fish.
566,00:36:48.62,00:36:48.62,It's almost like everything that I do is kind of like to ensure
567,00:36:53.42,00:36:53.42,to Ruth-Marie and Melinda that we'll be okay without the
568,00:36:56.29,00:36:56.29,lumberjack lady. And I hope it's working out.
569,00:37:27.29,00:37:27.29,>> PROBST: Behind each of you is a torch.
570,00:37:29.71,00:37:29.71,"Go ahead and grab a torch and approach the flame,"
571,00:37:32.67,00:37:32.67,dip it in and get fire. This is part of the ritual at
572,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,"Tribal Council because, in this game, fire represents your life:"
573,00:37:41.50,00:37:41.50,"as long as you have it, you're still in the game; when your"
574,00:37:44.12,00:37:44.12,"fire's gone, so are you. Take a seat."
575,00:37:51.08,00:37:51.08,"Well, welcome to Tribal Council. Not where you want to be."
576,00:37:55.12,00:37:55.12,"Melinda, been out here three days."
577,00:37:57.54,00:37:57.54,Tougher than you thought? Less tough than you expected?
578,00:38:00.79,00:38:00.79,"No, I would say that I'm currently in Panamanian Hell,"
579,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,"right about now. I mean, this is, by far, the"
580,00:38:07.08,00:38:07.08,hardest thing that I've ever done in my entire life.
581,00:38:09.54,00:38:09.54,And it's because it's all-encompassing.
582,00:38:12.00,00:38:12.00,"It's mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually,"
583,00:38:15.12,00:38:15.12,"I mean, that's why it's so difficult."
584,00:38:18.29,00:38:18.29,"You should try it. >> PROBST: It that right, Cirie?"
585,00:38:20.58,00:38:20.58,>> Absolutely. I've never lived outdoors.
586,00:38:22.62,00:38:22.62,"I've never even slept outdoors. So, for the people at home that"
587,00:38:27.04,00:38:27.04,"are like me, on the couch, stay on the couch."
588,00:38:30.46,00:38:30.46,(laughter) >> I completely agree.
589,00:38:33.54,00:38:33.54,">> Seriously, it's totally crazy to me."
590,00:38:37.62,00:38:37.62,"But now that I'm here, I want to do more."
591,00:38:42.21,00:38:42.21,">> PROBST: How you doing, Tina? >> I think I'm doing well."
592,00:38:45.25,00:38:45.25,I think it's been exciting to be out there.
593,00:38:47.79,00:38:47.79,"And I knew it was going to be very difficult, but, um, I'm"
594,00:38:49.88,00:38:49.88,pretty confident in what I know how to do.
595,00:38:53.08,00:38:53.08,And I've been living outdoors all my life.
596,00:38:56.42,00:38:56.42,"Ruth-Marie, that's got to be a little comforting to have"
597,00:38:59.25,00:38:59.25,somebody on your tribe who feels very comfortable in the
598,00:39:02.08,00:39:02.08,outdoors. >> Very much so.
599,00:39:04.21,00:39:04.21,It's been wonderful. We have someone who had those
600,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,abilities and took charge. And I think we did a good job
601,00:39:10.25,00:39:10.25,"of saying, you know, let her take the ball, run with it, and"
602,00:39:14.17,00:39:14.17,"we'll try to fill in the gaps. >> PROBST: Cirie, it's starting"
603,00:39:18.25,00:39:18.25,"to sound like, in some ways, Tina is leading you through"
604,00:39:21.12,00:39:21.12,"these first three days. >> Yeah, you can say that."
605,00:39:24.17,00:39:24.17,She... kind of took that position.
606,00:39:26.79,00:39:26.79,She did know how to start the fire.
607,00:39:29.67,00:39:29.67,"Um, she found the water. >> PROBST: Those are two huge"
608,00:39:33.12,00:39:33.12,things. Starting fire and finding
609,00:39:35.88,00:39:35.88,"the water are gigantic. >> Well, if Tina didn't find the"
610,00:39:39.04,00:39:39.04,"water, I'm sure one of the three of us could have found the"
611,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,water; and I believe we can start fire.
612,00:39:44.75,00:39:44.75,"She just stepped up and started doing things, so, I mean,"
613,00:39:47.29,00:39:47.29,"what do you do, break her arm, don't do that, don't start"
614,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,the fire? Don't go fish?
615,00:39:52.96,00:39:52.96,>> TINA: Do you think these other three are pulling their
616,00:39:55.04,00:39:55.04,"weight? >> Um, not as much as I would"
617,00:39:57.83,00:39:57.83,like to. I have a really huge work ethic.
618,00:40:01.04,00:40:01.04,"But I feel like if I keep saying, let's get more firewood,"
619,00:40:04.71,00:40:04.71,"let's go find a fishing spot, they're going to look at me as"
620,00:40:07.17,00:40:07.17,"a bigger leader than I am, and then my head's on the chopping"
621,00:40:09.88,00:40:09.88,block. So I just go out by myself and
622,00:40:12.46,00:40:12.46,"work hard and have a good life. >> PROBST: Melinda, any"
623,00:40:15.04,00:40:15.04,"disagreement on that? >> Um, no offense to Tina,"
624,00:40:17.46,00:40:17.46,"because she really has been out there working, but it's not like"
625,00:40:20.21,00:40:20.21,she's out there working and the three of us are taking a nap.
626,00:40:22.88,00:40:22.88,"I mean, all four of us are constantly doing something."
627,00:40:25.83,00:40:25.83,It's just that we might not be doing the same thing Tina's
628,00:40:28.25,00:40:28.25,"doing. >> PROBST: Okay, well, three"
629,00:40:31.88,00:40:31.88,"days in, only four people; sadly, there is very little room"
630,00:40:34.54,00:40:34.54,to hide. One of the four of you is about
631,00:40:36.96,00:40:36.96,to go home. It is time to vote.
632,00:40:39.17,00:40:39.17,"Melinda, you're up. >> I wish I could've learned"
633,00:40:58.04,00:40:58.04,more about you. We just didn't click.
634,00:41:13.04,00:41:13.04,">> Somebody has to go, and your fear of leaves was my biggest"
635,00:41:17.75,00:41:17.75,factor because we have to go in the leaves too.
636,00:41:28.83,00:41:28.83,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
637,00:41:39.17,00:41:39.17,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final. "
638,00:41:41.92,00:41:41.92,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
639,00:41:44.17,00:41:44.17,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
640,00:41:49.12,00:41:49.12,First vote: Tina. Cirie.
641,00:41:55.88,00:41:55.88,"One vote Tina, one vote Cirie. Tina."
642,00:42:03.92,00:42:03.92,"Two votes Tina, one vote Cirie, one vote left."
643,00:42:11.92,00:42:11.92,First person voted out of Survivor: Exile Island.
644,00:42:15.38,00:42:15.38,"Tina, would you bring my your torch."
645,00:42:27.42,00:42:27.42,"Tina, your tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
646,00:42:34.00,00:42:34.00,">> Have fun. >> PROBST: Well, you're only"
647,00:42:47.46,00:42:47.46,three days in to what all of you have agreed is already the
648,00:42:51.17,00:42:51.17,"toughest thing you've ever done, and yet, you vote out the one"
649,00:42:54.25,00:42:54.25,person who could make your life a little easier.
650,00:42:57.38,00:42:57.38,Be interesting to see how it plays out.
651,00:42:59.42,00:42:59.42,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
652,00:43:01.42,00:43:01.42,Good night. Captioned by 
653,00:43:08.38,00:43:08.38, Media Access Group at WGBH  access.wgbh.org
654,00:43:12.75,00:43:12.75,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
655,00:43:18.12,00:43:18.12,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
656,00:43:20.12,00:43:20.12,A twist on Exile Island raises the stakes.
657,00:43:23.54,00:43:23.54,>> Ah... >> PROBST: The pressure gets to
658,00:43:25.58,00:43:25.58,Shane. >> There's no reason for me to
659,00:43:27.17,00:43:27.17,be doing this. >> Shane wants to quit.
660,00:43:29.96,00:43:29.96,Let him quit. >> PROBST: And the storm moves
661,00:43:32.50,00:43:32.50,in. >> This place breeds bad luck.
662,00:43:35.96,00:43:35.96,(thunder crashes) >> I think the girls made a huge
663,00:43:43.50,00:43:43.50,"mistake, voting me out. I hope they do terribly."
664,00:43:47.08,00:43:47.08,"Working hard is what I do, and I think it worked against me on"
665,00:43:50.25,00:43:50.25,"this one, but I would not have been able to change a thing,"
666,00:43:55.62,00:43:55.62,'cause that's just who I am. That was really a great
667,00:43:58.04,00:43:58.04,experience.  I have no regrets.
668,00:44:00.12,00:44:00.12,I was just with the wrong girls.
