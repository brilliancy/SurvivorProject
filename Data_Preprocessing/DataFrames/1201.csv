145,00:10:27.50,00:10:27.50,It's up to you.The important thing to remember
146,00:10:30.17,00:10:30.17,"is that you can use it anytime,up through the final four, but"
147,00:10:34.04,00:10:34.04,"once there are only three of youremaining, the idol can be used"
148,00:10:37.42,00:10:37.42,no more.But here's the best part: you
149,00:10:40.50,00:10:40.50,can hold on to that idol untilafter the votes have been
150,00:10:44.75,00:10:44.75,revealed at Tribal Council.That means you could have enough

168,00:11:51.29,00:11:51.29,You also have a lot of time tothink about why fate chose you
169,00:11:57.75,00:11:57.75,"to be the first one out here,which is also why immunity is"
170,00:12:02.29,00:12:02.29,already so important.And as for your first clue to
171,00:12:05.29,00:12:05.29,"the whereabouts, I've alreadygiven it to you."
172,00:12:08.12,00:12:08.12,Good luck.See you at the immunity

177,00:12:58.38,00:12:58.38,I definitely feel veryvulnerable.
178,00:13:01.42,00:13:01.42,"I didn't expect this, thissoon, this early, so it came as"
179,00:13:04.96,00:13:04.96,"quite a shock.Think, Misty, think."
180,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,"Jeff did say there's an immunityidol on the island, and he left"
181,00:13:11.50,00:13:11.50,"me with clues.He said, ""Why did fate leave"
182,00:13:14.50,00:13:14.50,"you behind?""Behind me."
183,00:13:17.75,00:13:17.75,It seems to me like he wastrying to tell us that the
184,00:13:20.08,00:13:20.08,"immunity idol was buried behindus, where we were standing."
185,00:13:24.25,00:13:24.25,"That was my guess, anyways.Behind me."

565,00:36:48.62,00:36:48.62,It's almost like everything thatI do is kind of like to ensure
566,00:36:53.42,00:36:53.42,to Ruth-Marie and Melinda thatwe'll be okay without the
567,00:36:56.29,00:36:56.29,lumberjack lady.And I hope it's working out.

572,00:37:41.50,00:37:41.50,"as long as you have it, you'restill in the game; when your"

577,00:38:00.79,00:38:00.79,"No, I would say that I'mcurrently in Panamanian Hell,"
578,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,"right about now.I mean, this is, by far, the"
579,00:38:07.08,00:38:07.08,hardest thing that I've everdone in my entire life.
580,00:38:09.54,00:38:09.54,And it's because it'sall-encompassing.
581,00:38:12.00,00:38:12.00,"It's mentally, physically,emotionally, spiritually,"
582,00:38:15.12,00:38:15.12,"I mean, that's why it's sodifficult."
583,00:38:18.29,00:38:18.29,"You should try it.>> PROBST: It that right, Cirie?"
584,00:38:20.58,00:38:20.58,>> Absolutely.I've never lived outdoors.
585,00:38:22.62,00:38:22.62,"I've never even slept outdoors.So, for the people at home that"
586,00:38:27.04,00:38:27.04,"are like me, on the couch, stayon the couch."
587,00:38:30.46,00:38:30.46,(laughter)>> I completely agree.

591,00:38:45.25,00:38:45.25,I think it's been exciting to beout there.
592,00:38:47.79,00:38:47.79,"And I knew it was going to bevery difficult, but, um, I'm"
593,00:38:49.88,00:38:49.88,pretty confident in what I knowhow to do.
594,00:38:53.08,00:38:53.08,And I've been living outdoorsall my life.
595,00:38:56.42,00:38:56.42,"Ruth-Marie, that's got to bea little comforting to have"
596,00:38:59.25,00:38:59.25,somebody on your tribe who feelsvery comfortable in the
597,00:39:02.08,00:39:02.08,outdoors.>> Very much so.
598,00:39:04.21,00:39:04.21,It's been wonderful.We have someone who had those
599,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,abilities and took charge.And I think we did a good job
600,00:39:10.25,00:39:10.25,"of saying, you know, let hertake the ball, run with it, and"
601,00:39:14.17,00:39:14.17,"we'll try to fill in the gaps.>> PROBST: Cirie, it's starting"
602,00:39:18.25,00:39:18.25,"to sound like, in some ways,Tina is leading you through"
603,00:39:21.12,00:39:21.12,"these first three days.>> Yeah, you can say that."
604,00:39:24.17,00:39:24.17,She... kind of took thatposition.
605,00:39:26.79,00:39:26.79,She did know how to start thefire.
606,00:39:29.67,00:39:29.67,"Um, she found the water.>> PROBST: Those are two huge"
607,00:39:33.12,00:39:33.12,things.Starting fire and finding
608,00:39:35.88,00:39:35.88,"the water are gigantic.>> Well, if Tina didn't find the"
609,00:39:39.04,00:39:39.04,"water, I'm sure one of the threeof us could have found the"
610,00:39:42.00,00:39:42.00,water; and I believe we canstart fire.
611,00:39:44.75,00:39:44.75,"She just stepped up and starteddoing things, so, I mean,"
612,00:39:47.29,00:39:47.29,"what do you do, break her arm,don't do that, don't start"
613,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,the fire?Don't go fish?
614,00:39:52.96,00:39:52.96,>> TINA: Do you think theseother three are pulling their
615,00:39:55.04,00:39:55.04,"weight?>> Um, not as much as I would"
616,00:39:57.83,00:39:57.83,like to.I have a really huge work ethic.
617,00:40:01.04,00:40:01.04,"But I feel like if I keepsaying, let's get more firewood,"
618,00:40:04.71,00:40:04.71,"let's go find a fishing spot,they're going to look at me as"
619,00:40:07.17,00:40:07.17,"a bigger leader than I am, andthen my head's on the chopping"
620,00:40:09.88,00:40:09.88,block.So I just go out by myself and
621,00:40:12.46,00:40:12.46,"work hard and have a good life.>> PROBST: Melinda, any"
622,00:40:15.04,00:40:15.04,"disagreement on that?>> Um, no offense to Tina,"
623,00:40:17.46,00:40:17.46,"because she really has been outthere working, but it's not like"
624,00:40:20.21,00:40:20.21,she's out there working and thethree of us are taking a nap.
625,00:40:22.88,00:40:22.88,"I mean, all four of us areconstantly doing something."
626,00:40:25.83,00:40:25.83,It's just that we might not bedoing the same thing Tina's
627,00:40:28.25,00:40:28.25,"doing.>> PROBST: Okay, well, three"
