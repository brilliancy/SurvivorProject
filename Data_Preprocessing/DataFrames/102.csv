2,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,  JEFF PROBST:   16 Americans forced  to abandon ship
3,00:00:04.50,00:00:04.50, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:08.47,00:00:08.47," Marooned for 39 days,"
5,00:00:11.63,00:00:11.63," they must work together     to build shelter,"
6,00:00:13.87,00:00:13.87,"  find food,  and survive the island."
7,00:00:16.60,00:00:16.60," But ultimately, it is     everyone for themselves."
8,00:00:20.50,00:00:20.50,  Every third night they will     hike deep into the jungle
9,00:00:23.50,00:00:23.50, to take part   in the Tribal Council
10,00:00:25.53,00:00:25.53,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
11,00:00:29.53,00:00:29.53," In the end,  only one will remain"
12,00:00:31.53,00:00:31.53,  and will leave the island
13,00:00:33.20,00:00:33.20,  with $1 million in cash.
14,00:00:38.73,00:00:38.73, Last week on Survivor
15,00:00:42.00,00:00:42.00, the two tribes arrived    at separate beaches
16,00:00:43.90,00:00:43.90,  and began building  their new home.
17,00:00:45.30,00:00:45.30,  ( whooping )
18,00:00:47.17,00:00:47.17," On Pagong Beach, trouble began"
19,00:00:48.93,00:00:48.93,  when B.B. tried to force   his work ethic on the tribe.
20,00:00:51.63,00:00:51.63, B.B.:   We got a lot of lazy people  if you want to know the truth.
21,00:00:54.03,00:00:54.03," JOEL:  He's a character, man."
22,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07,I don't think he likes me much.
23,00:00:58.57,00:00:58.57,   We can't have lazy people.
24,00:00:59.90,00:00:59.90," JEFF:   Over at Tagi Beach,"
25,00:01:01.03,00:01:01.03,  the generation gap
26,00:01:02.03,00:01:02.03,  was also causing problems.
27,00:01:03.83,00:01:03.83, KELLY:  He was yelling at everybody.
28,00:01:06.90,00:01:06.90, He may be 72 years old
29,00:01:08.33,00:01:08.33,"  and an ex-Navy Seal,"
30,00:01:09.63,00:01:09.63, but that doesn't mean that this is his world.
31,00:01:12.30,00:01:12.30,"   I don't even know   what ""MTV"" means, you know."
32,00:01:14.57,00:01:14.57,"  I got to fit in, not them."
33,00:01:16.07,00:01:16.07," You know, there's more of them   than there is of me."
34,00:01:18.27,00:01:18.27," JEFF:    And Stacey, the attorney,   attempted to organize"
35,00:01:20.73,00:01:20.73, the women against Rudy.
36,00:01:21.93,00:01:21.93,STACEY: Kelly and I get along real well
37,00:01:23.57,00:01:23.57, and we've been talking
38,00:01:25.53,00:01:25.53,  about who    would be best to vote off.
39,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33, We've talked to Sue about it.
40,00:01:29.17,00:01:29.17, SUSAN:   She don't like Rudy  because he's too barky.
41,00:01:31.77,00:01:31.77,  Anybody's too barky     and too bossy for Stacey
42,00:01:33.90,00:01:33.90,  because she   doesn't move her ass.
43,00:01:35.43,00:01:35.43,  The chicks think I'm voting   for one person and I'm not.
44,00:01:37.93,00:01:37.93,  What time do we   got to do this at?
45,00:01:39.40,00:01:39.40,  We've got    the Tribal Council tonight
46,00:01:41.03,00:01:41.03,and one of us is going to leave.
47,00:01:42.60,00:01:42.60,RICHARD:  I've narrowed it down to four.
48,00:01:44.23,00:01:44.23,I'm one of them.
49,00:01:50.63,00:01:50.63,  First person voted   off the island...
50,00:01:53.60,00:01:53.60,  Sonja.
51,00:01:55.53,00:01:55.53,   The tribe has spoken.
52,00:01:57.10,00:01:57.10,"  Although likable and sweet,   Sonja was considered"
53,00:01:59.67,00:01:59.67, the weakest link in the tribe   and was first to go.
54,00:02:03.50,00:02:03.50, 15 are left.
55,00:02:04.90,00:02:04.90, Who will be going home    this week?
56,00:03:07.73,00:03:07.73,STACEY:   I'm hungry.
57,00:03:09.17,00:03:09.17,I think we're all pretty hungry.
58,00:03:10.77,00:03:10.77," I've gone days when I've only  had some fruit, but..."
59,00:03:13.37,00:03:13.37, there's no prospect of having   any fruit here. It's worse.
60,00:03:16.60,00:03:16.60,"  We got two rats,  primed and ready to be cooked."
61,00:03:19.63,00:03:19.63,  It's dire.
62,00:03:21.47,00:03:21.47, RUDY:  These guys were talking    about eating a rat.
63,00:03:25.07,00:03:25.07," And when I get hungry enough,    I'll eat one, but not now."
64,00:03:28.03,00:03:28.03,I'm not close to it yet.
65,00:03:29.53,00:03:29.53, SEAN:   I'd like to catch something
66,00:03:32.40,00:03:32.40," and eat something of our own,     and not have it be a rat."
67,00:03:34.87,00:03:34.87, I'd like that a lot.
68,00:03:37.00,00:03:37.00," KELLY:  Fishing, um..."
69,00:03:39.60,00:03:39.60,"   I think we've been doing,    you know,"
70,00:03:41.67,00:03:41.67,  w-what we're supposed to do. We've...
71,00:03:43.63,00:03:43.63, We've collected   hermit crabs.
72,00:03:45.43,00:03:45.43, We've put them in the traps.
73,00:03:46.83,00:03:46.83,  We rafted them out.
74,00:03:48.53,00:03:48.53,"  You know, if we can just    catch the one fish,"
75,00:03:50.27,00:03:50.27,  then we can use that as bait
76,00:03:51.57,00:03:51.57, and we'll catch more.
77,00:03:53.10,00:03:53.10,"  Right there.    Right there, right there."
78,00:03:54.70,00:03:54.70,"STACEY: Yep, there it is."
79,00:03:56.20,00:03:56.20,"   White, floatie, floatie..."
80,00:03:57.20,00:03:57.20,Straight ahead.
81,00:03:58.97,00:03:58.97,RICHARD:    Damn well better be fish.
82,00:04:00.43,00:04:00.43,"KELLY: Oh, my gosh."
83,00:04:02.13,00:04:02.13,  ( humming fanfare )
84,00:04:05.20,00:04:05.20,"Come on, fishy, baby."
85,00:04:07.00,00:04:07.00,Fish are pretty stupid.
86,00:04:09.13,00:04:09.13,See what?
87,00:04:10.40,00:04:10.40,Bait hanging and nothing moving.
88,00:04:11.87,00:04:11.87,  Oh.
89,00:04:12.90,00:04:12.90, Empty.
90,00:04:14.13,00:04:14.13,These suck.
91,00:04:15.30,00:04:15.30,  These do suck.
92,00:04:16.57,00:04:16.57," We're getting there,  getting to know"
93,00:04:18.47,00:04:18.47, each other a little bit more.
94,00:04:20.03,00:04:20.03, I really want to learn
95,00:04:21.10,00:04:21.10,a little bit more about Stacey.
96,00:04:22.43,00:04:22.43,"  Because, you know-- I voted her off."
97,00:04:23.53,00:04:23.53, She thinks it was Rudy.
98,00:04:24.83,00:04:24.83,  She even came up  to me and said
99,00:04:26.33,00:04:26.33,"  ""Yeah, I think Rudy voted  me off, but that's okay"
100,00:04:28.67,00:04:28.67,"  'cause he's next anyway."""
101,00:04:30.40,00:04:30.40,STACEY:  I think after the vote   at the Island Council
102,00:04:32.53,00:04:32.53, Rudy realized that he was just    sort of a liability to us.
103,00:04:35.30,00:04:35.30, He was sitting around  barking orders
104,00:04:36.90,00:04:36.90,and not really helping out much.
105,00:04:38.70,00:04:38.70,  We've all seen him eating     extra food and just doing
106,00:04:41.47,00:04:41.47, inappropriate things  in the kitchen.
107,00:04:43.10,00:04:43.10," Like, he's leaving the knives    out, they're getting rusty,"
108,00:04:46.07,00:04:46.07,  and he's opening  canned goods and fruit
109,00:04:47.80,00:04:47.80, without asking anybody.
110,00:04:49.23,00:04:49.23," I mean, we don't have   a lot of food here,"
111,00:04:50.63,00:04:50.63, so I spoke up.
112,00:04:51.93,00:04:51.93,"   Actually, Kelly, Sue and I decided"
113,00:04:53.50,00:04:53.50,  that somebody needed    to say something.
114,00:04:54.80,00:04:54.80,And we put all the canned goods   in one spot.
115,00:04:56.30,00:04:56.30,We're all going to vote  before we open something else.
116,00:04:58.57,00:04:58.57, RUDY:  Me and her wouldn't get along
117,00:05:01.57,00:05:01.57,   if we were friends    on the outside...
118,00:05:03.97,00:05:03.97,   I'd definitely avoid her.
119,00:05:06.00,00:05:06.00," She's too, uh,"
120,00:05:07.90,00:05:07.90," prim-like, you know.   I mean, uh..."
121,00:05:09.70,00:05:09.70,"after about three weeks out here in this jungle,"
122,00:05:12.50,00:05:12.50,"  she's going to learn    a lesson, I think."
123,00:05:17.10,00:05:17.10,STACEY:    Boards underneath
124,00:05:18.63,00:05:18.63,or the support structure   underneath?
125,00:05:20.67,00:05:20.67, B.B.:   How are you working  on your back?
126,00:05:22.50,00:05:22.50,Tie that into there?
127,00:05:23.63,00:05:23.63, Yeah. Tie it into here.
128,00:05:25.03,00:05:25.03,You think I'm a miracle worker?
129,00:05:25.03,00:05:25.03,   Well...
130,00:05:33.53,00:05:33.53, JENNA:    We're getting things done
131,00:05:34.93,00:05:34.93, because B.B.  is such a great worker.
132,00:05:36.53,00:05:36.53, He gets us up.    We're moving stuff
133,00:05:38.03,00:05:38.03,  this morning and everything.
134,00:05:39.27,00:05:39.27,  He's doing that.
135,00:05:40.27,00:05:40.27,   Whatever you say.
136,00:05:41.27,00:05:41.27,All right.
137,00:05:42.27,00:05:42.27,You've cut her four times.
138,00:05:43.90,00:05:43.90,"They're still too short, right?"
139,00:05:50.53,00:05:50.53," B.B.:    When you get done, you're   gonna have to take the broom"
140,00:05:52.70,00:05:52.70,   and sweep out this place.
141,00:05:59.43,00:05:59.43,"COLLEEN:  I mean, really, B.B."
142,00:06:01.17,00:06:01.17, He's adorable.
143,00:06:02.20,00:06:02.20,"I mean, who doesn't want to own"
144,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40, the B.B. action figure?
145,00:06:05.60,00:06:05.60,   He's great. He's amazing.
146,00:06:07.00,00:06:07.00, He's got more stories
147,00:06:08.43,00:06:08.43,  than anybody    I've ever met in my life.
148,00:06:10.33,00:06:10.33,I think he's a little bit out of his element and he doesn't know
149,00:06:14.17,00:06:14.17,  how to fix it without being a little bit aggressive.
150,00:06:17.53,00:06:17.53, Ready? Careful.
151,00:06:18.60,00:06:18.60,Yeah. All right.
152,00:06:19.63,00:06:19.63,Hold tight.
153,00:06:22.07,00:06:22.07,The biggest workers are probably
154,00:06:23.63,00:06:23.63," Gretchen, Craig and... I can't think of the lady's name"
155,00:06:26.40,00:06:26.40,"   in the pink swimming suit,"
156,00:06:28.97,00:06:28.97,"  but she,     she works her heart out."
157,00:06:30.33,00:06:30.33,"You got two hands, right?"
158,00:06:32.10,00:06:32.10,"   I've got two, but    I-I'm keeping"
159,00:06:34.23,00:06:34.23,  myself up with one.
160,00:06:35.93,00:06:35.93,   GRETCHEN:   Work ethic  is a big issue to B.B.
161,00:06:37.73,00:06:37.73," Regardless of their wonderful    personality or something,"
162,00:06:40.50,00:06:40.50,"you know, it comes down    to that with him."
163,00:06:42.27,00:06:42.27,RAMONA:  You're working your butt off   and he doesn't like to rest.
164,00:06:45.53,00:06:45.53,  He's like this workaholic.
165,00:06:47.83,00:06:47.83," He just wants to get it done,    get it done, get it done,"
166,00:06:50.50,00:06:50.50,"and, yeah, that's great    sometimes,"
167,00:06:52.00,00:06:52.00,  but you can't push    yourself like that
168,00:06:54.27,00:06:54.27," and still, you know,    maintain..."
169,00:06:56.33,00:06:56.33,I don't know. I just...
170,00:06:57.57,00:06:57.57, I don't see it lasting too much longer.
171,00:07:00.97,00:07:00.97, What's our  fish situation?
172,00:07:02.40,00:07:02.40,Who doesn't have chopsticks now?
173,00:07:04.07,00:07:04.07," GREG:  B.B., These are great."
174,00:07:06.43,00:07:06.43," Yeah, they work  really well."
175,00:07:07.63,00:07:07.63, Uh-huh.
176,00:07:09.53,00:07:09.53,"  B.B.    The only thing I ask you,   is take care of them"
177,00:07:10.57,00:07:10.57,"so I don't have to redo this again,"
178,00:07:12.77,00:07:12.77,'cause after I make eight
179,00:07:13.93,00:07:13.93,I won't remember how to make nine sets.
180,00:07:15.63,00:07:15.63,"RAMONA:   At this point, no one wants"
181,00:07:17.57,00:07:17.57," to have a confrontation     with him,"
182,00:07:20.07,00:07:20.07," so, it's like,  whatever B.B. says, it's like"
183,00:07:22.60,00:07:22.60,"  ""Okay, B.B., yeah.    Whatever you want."""
184,00:07:24.37,00:07:24.37,"  And, I don't know,    I guess, honestly,"
185,00:07:26.83,00:07:26.83,if we were to ever lose  an immunity challenge
186,00:07:28.90,00:07:28.90,  I think he'd probably be     the first one voted off.
187,00:07:41.53,00:07:41.53, RICHARD:  Rudy's cooking.
188,00:07:43.17,00:07:43.17,"   KELLY:    Oh, nice."
189,00:07:45.07,00:07:45.07,"  Whatcha cooking, Rude?"
190,00:07:47.30,00:07:47.30,   I'm going to make  the rice and a papaya.
191,00:07:49.33,00:07:49.33,Cool.
192,00:07:50.60,00:07:50.60,  Mix it...
193,00:07:50.60,00:07:50.60,Beautiful.
194,00:07:51.83,00:07:51.83,Do we have any lemon left?
195,00:07:54.60,00:07:54.60,"Yeah, you can put it in    yourself."
196,00:07:56.27,00:07:56.27,RICHARD: Sounds awesome.
197,00:07:57.73,00:07:57.73,"Cook it up, Rude."
198,00:07:57.73,00:07:57.73,Chef Rudy.
199,00:07:59.77,00:07:59.77,   We're ready whenever.
200,00:08:01.07,00:08:01.07,"We don't have any fish, but we got the traps set."
201,00:08:04.53,00:08:04.53,RICHARD:  Rudy and I--   i-it's an interesting dynamic
202,00:08:07.30,00:08:07.30, because if he knew I were gay
203,00:08:09.03,00:08:09.03," that would probably be really   difficult for him, I think."
204,00:08:12.30,00:08:12.30,"72 Years old, Navy vet."
205,00:08:13.60,00:08:13.60,I think it would just freak him.
206,00:08:15.60,00:08:15.60,"  But, he doesn't,   as far as I know, know that,"
207,00:08:18.63,00:08:18.63,and I think he feels comfortable  talking to me.
208,00:08:20.07,00:08:20.07,   I'm certainly comfortable
209,00:08:21.07,00:08:21.07, talking to him.
210,00:08:22.40,00:08:22.40, He's an interesting character.
211,00:08:27.13,00:08:27.13,DIRK: There's an excellent review...
212,00:08:27.13,00:08:27.13,Self-sufficient.
213,00:08:28.93,00:08:28.93,"on male, I mean, I know, you're not just homosexual."
214,00:08:30.83,00:08:30.83,I know gay guys don't like to be called that
215,00:08:32.97,00:08:32.97,"'cause you're not homosexual, you're gay, you know."
216,00:08:35.77,00:08:35.77, No. I'm homosexual. Do we not   not like to be called that?
217,00:08:37.50,00:08:37.50,"No, because it just..."
218,00:08:39.47,00:08:39.47,  No... it's only   classifying people   in sexual terms.
219,00:08:41.03,00:08:41.03,   SUSAN:    It's a lifestyle.
220,00:08:42.03,00:08:42.03,Right.
221,00:08:42.03,00:08:42.03,Right.
222,00:08:43.27,00:08:43.27,"   Well, there is a lifestyle"
223,00:08:44.77,00:08:44.77,"   associated with being gay,"
224,00:08:46.30,00:08:46.30,Yeah.
225,00:08:46.30,00:08:46.30,but it's not something...
226,00:08:48.10,00:08:48.10," You can't say,  ""I decided to be gay."""
227,00:08:50.50,00:08:50.50,   But it's been interesting    in this new environment
228,00:08:52.73,00:08:52.73,   to kind of decide    when to say
229,00:08:53.93,00:08:53.93,what about yourselves.
230,00:08:55.67,00:08:55.67,I think there's only one person
231,00:08:58.03,00:08:58.03,you got to worry about.
232,00:08:59.60,00:08:59.60,"RICHARD: Oh, I'm not worried about him at all."
233,00:09:02.20,00:09:02.20,"   As people get to know me,   they learn who I am"
234,00:09:04.63,00:09:04.63,"and then eventually, over time,    find out I'm gay."
235,00:09:07.33,00:09:07.33,   I've never once in my life  encountered prejudice
236,00:09:09.67,00:09:09.67, based on my being homosexual.
237,00:09:12.30,00:09:12.30, RUDY:   I was big-mouthing the whole time coming over here
238,00:09:14.67,00:09:14.67, about being with homosexuals   and lesbians.
239,00:09:17.90,00:09:17.90,"  So I found out last night,     you know."
240,00:09:20.37,00:09:20.37, When he came up here
241,00:09:22.73,00:09:22.73,"he said, uh, ""You want to talk?"""
242,00:09:24.63,00:09:24.63,"I says,   ""No, I don't want to talk."""
243,00:09:26.93,00:09:26.93,  And he was going to tell me    he was queer then.
244,00:09:29.53,00:09:29.53,The weather ain't going to change.
245,00:09:30.87,00:09:30.87,If we went six degrees below.
246,00:09:32.60,00:09:32.60,Where the hell is Borneo?
247,00:09:34.37,00:09:34.37,   That way?
248,00:09:36.10,00:09:36.10," RUDY:  The homosexual,"
249,00:09:37.50,00:09:37.50,  he's one of the nicest guys    I ever met
250,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33," and he's good at what he does,    you know."
251,00:09:42.93,00:09:42.93,"  He's got leadership ability,"
252,00:09:44.93,00:09:44.93,"  and if these people here   would listen to him,"
253,00:09:47.13,00:09:47.13, he would take them a long way.
254,00:09:49.10,00:09:49.10,"  But anyway,"
255,00:09:51.23,00:09:51.23,me and Richard got to be  pretty good friends--
256,00:09:54.37,00:09:54.37,"not in a homosexual way, that's for sure."
257,00:09:57.03,00:09:57.03,Make sure you get this on TV.
258,00:09:58.70,00:09:58.70,"Oh, boy, you better have a beer   in your hand"
259,00:10:01.10,00:10:01.10,"  when you're doing this one,  Rudy."
260,00:10:02.90,00:10:02.90, RUDY:  He's a pretty good guy.
261,00:10:04.53,00:10:04.53,  I don't know what my buddies are going to say
262,00:10:06.83,00:10:06.83,"when I get home, but..."
263,00:10:08.23,00:10:08.23,  I'll have to deal with that.
264,00:10:14.57,00:10:14.57, KELLY:  I'm thinking we should dam off a part.
265,00:10:18.20,00:10:18.20,To walk over?
266,00:10:19.43,00:10:19.43," Yeah, well."
267,00:10:20.67,00:10:20.67,"Now it's, like, satiated, 'cause I wanted papaya."
268,00:10:23.83,00:10:23.83, Here.
269,00:10:23.83,00:10:23.83,You don't want it?
270,00:10:25.27,00:10:25.27,Nope.
271,00:10:25.27,00:10:25.27,"Well, then, I'll eat it."
272,00:10:27.03,00:10:27.03,"RAMONA:  I'm very, very finicky"
273,00:10:28.90,00:10:28.90," and as hungry as I am,   if I really... if I eat that"
274,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,   I'm going to throw it up.
275,00:10:33.80,00:10:33.80,   And I'd rather them eat it
276,00:10:35.60,00:10:35.60,   and be able to swallow it  and digest it
277,00:10:38.00,00:10:38.00,"   than me to waste it, so..."
278,00:10:39.87,00:10:39.87," I'll just drink water,    try to compensate."
279,00:10:42.37,00:10:42.37,   Ramona's hurting big-time.
280,00:10:44.13,00:10:44.13,"  I feel bad for her, 'cause she wants so hard"
281,00:10:46.87,00:10:46.87," to, you know, get into the mix  of things and help out"
282,00:10:50.33,00:10:50.33,"  and do her job, do her part,"
283,00:10:51.80,00:10:51.80,but she's just not feeling well.
284,00:10:59.63,00:10:59.63,"  JENNA:   You all right,   Ramona?"
285,00:11:01.20,00:11:01.20,  ( coughing )
286,00:11:07.67,00:11:07.67,  ( coughing )
287,00:11:09.57,00:11:09.57,   GRETCHEN:  I don't think    this is what she expected.
288,00:11:11.87,00:11:11.87, I don't think she'd ever quit.
289,00:11:13.53,00:11:13.53, I think she doesn't even want to admit
290,00:11:15.37,00:11:15.37," that she's laying down a lot,"
291,00:11:17.00,00:11:17.00,"   but, um, I think it's only because she doesn't want to say"
292,00:11:19.67,00:11:19.67,"  that she can't be successful  at something,"
293,00:11:20.83,00:11:20.83, 'cause I think she... I think at home
294,00:11:22.23,00:11:22.23, she's very successful    at what she does.
295,00:11:28.13,00:11:28.13, B.B.:  Well...
296,00:11:29.67,00:11:29.67, I think the work-ethic problem    is-- doesn't ever change.
297,00:11:32.03,00:11:32.03,The people who are working work
298,00:11:33.73,00:11:33.73, and the people who rest     are resting and that's...
299,00:11:37.00,00:11:37.00," that's the way it is about 80, 85% of the time."
300,00:11:39.23,00:11:39.23, The laziest person is Ramona.
301,00:11:41.07,00:11:41.07,"  I mean, she just doesn't   contribute anything."
302,00:11:43.47,00:11:43.47,  She probably hasn't worked ten or 15 minutes in five days.
303,00:11:46.77,00:11:46.77,"  She's really a drag   because she drinks our water,"
304,00:11:49.53,00:11:49.53,   takes our... eats our food
305,00:11:51.63,00:11:51.63, and takes room in the hutch.
306,00:11:53.37,00:11:53.37,GERVASE:    He's such a hard worker.
307,00:11:54.67,00:11:54.67, If you're not working  as hard as him
308,00:11:56.27,00:11:56.27,you're not working hard.
309,00:11:57.37,00:11:57.37, I think it's just that simple.
310,00:11:59.00,00:11:59.00,I feel everybody's been pulling    their weight here.
311,00:12:00.47,00:12:00.47, Nobody's been slacking.
312,00:12:01.70,00:12:01.70," I mean, people have been sick."
313,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,People have been hurting and I don't expect them to work.
314,00:12:06.03,00:12:06.03, GREG:   B.B.'s a good guy.
315,00:12:07.57,00:12:07.57,   He's pretty strong-willed  and he's got his plan as well.
316,00:12:10.50,00:12:10.50, He's caring.    He demands respect.
317,00:12:13.30,00:12:13.30,Definitely feels the difference  between his age and other  people
318,00:12:16.80,00:12:16.80,and doesn't seem to want    to bridge that gap
319,00:12:18.47,00:12:18.47, as much as just be who he is.
320,00:12:21.30,00:12:21.30,   We're probably about five   or six minutes away
321,00:12:23.63,00:12:23.63,  from a delicious breakfast.
322,00:12:25.13,00:12:25.13,"GRETCHEN: You know, B.B., throw a lot more water in there."
323,00:12:26.67,00:12:26.67,You guys are like backseat cooks.
324,00:12:29.00,00:12:29.00,"   RAMONA:    You're a backseat    everything,"
325,00:12:30.60,00:12:30.60,so don't be throwing stones.
326,00:12:32.37,00:12:32.37,"I think they find me, probably, abrasive, authoritarian."
327,00:12:35.53,00:12:35.53,   There's probably a couple   of other adjectives
328,00:12:37.73,00:12:37.73,"you could throw in there  that would probably work, too."
329,00:12:40.63,00:12:40.63,When you get to be 64 years old
330,00:12:42.67,00:12:42.67,"   I'll let you give  all the orders, okay?"
331,00:12:44.87,00:12:44.87,   I won't make    it that long.
332,00:12:46.20,00:12:46.20,  B.B.  I don't care.
333,00:12:47.63,00:12:47.63, I'm not trying to win  a personality contest.
334,00:12:49.67,00:12:49.67,I just want to make my life here    as comfortable as possible
335,00:12:52.43,00:12:52.43,   and then get the hell off.
336,00:13:01.47,00:13:01.47,It's really no problem.
337,00:13:03.00,00:13:03.00,  It's just like   walking across
338,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13, a log in the river.
339,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,"Oh, yeah."
340,00:13:06.03,00:13:06.03,"RAMONA:  Well, the whole     Colleen-and-Greg thing--"
341,00:13:08.80,00:13:08.80," I don't know what's going on,   what's not going on,"
342,00:13:12.67,00:13:12.67, but I kind of noticed  like a couple of times
343,00:13:15.67,00:13:15.67, they went off for fruit   or whatever.
344,00:13:20.40,00:13:20.40, GREG:   Colleen and I share
345,00:13:22.83,00:13:22.83,a similar way of looking at everything that's happening.
346,00:13:25.50,00:13:25.50,   Don't smile on swampie there.
347,00:13:27.00,00:13:27.00,COLLEEN:  Greg is great.
348,00:13:28.53,00:13:28.53," It's just good    to have a friend, you know."
349,00:13:30.47,00:13:30.47,"  Sometimes, when you come"
350,00:13:31.80,00:13:31.80, to a country--   a foreign country--
351,00:13:33.40,00:13:33.40, a lot of times  you're really nervous
352,00:13:35.30,00:13:35.30,about all the mysteries that are there.
353,00:13:37.37,00:13:37.37,"  You know,  you hear about malaria."
354,00:13:38.77,00:13:38.77," You hear about this,   you hear about that."
355,00:13:40.80,00:13:40.80,  Those aren't worms;   those are leeches.
356,00:13:42.70,00:13:42.70, What?
357,00:13:42.70,00:13:42.70,Nothing.
358,00:13:44.27,00:13:44.27,"COLLEEN:    Like him,  walking around barefoot"
359,00:13:46.03,00:13:46.03," and picking up things   and whatever,"
360,00:13:48.63,00:13:48.63,"you feel a lot more comfortable,"
361,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17, and the place becomes more your home.
362,00:13:51.67,00:13:51.67,( Colleen chuckling )
363,00:13:53.30,00:13:53.30,Come on over this way.
364,00:13:54.90,00:13:54.90,"  Oh, my God!"
365,00:13:56.03,00:13:56.03,"Oh, this is so fun."
366,00:13:57.30,00:13:57.30, GREG:  She's really fun to play with
367,00:13:58.47,00:13:58.47," because she's fun, energetic."
368,00:14:01.00,00:14:01.00,"   Oh, yeah."
369,00:14:03.13,00:14:03.13,"  She's, uh, rough and ready."
370,00:14:04.30,00:14:04.30," It's just, like, I'm actually"
371,00:14:05.47,00:14:05.47,"   making a friend out here,"
372,00:14:06.87,00:14:06.87,  which I didn't think   was really possible.
373,00:14:09.67,00:14:09.67,RAMONA:   Greg and Colleen--    they had disappeared again.
374,00:14:12.87,00:14:12.87,"  And we were, like,  where are they?"
375,00:14:14.43,00:14:14.43," I mean, they were gone    for, like, an hour."
376,00:14:17.70,00:14:17.70,"You know, they come back    and we had no idea"
377,00:14:19.83,00:14:19.83,"   where they'd gone,    what they'd done,"
378,00:14:21.37,00:14:21.37,"   until that night, you know, they were like"
379,00:14:22.97,00:14:22.97,"   ""Okay, we're going   to have game night."""
380,00:14:25.20,00:14:25.20,   And we played the All-new  Newly Stranded Survivor game.
381,00:14:31.03,00:14:31.03,   ( hooting and hollering )
382,00:14:36.83,00:14:36.83," GREG:    Today, we're going to play the All-new Newly Stranded game."
383,00:14:43.13,00:14:43.13,  ( cheering )
384,00:14:44.90,00:14:44.90,"RAMONA:  Basically, it was kind of like     a newlywed game."
385,00:14:47.47,00:14:47.47, Team one was Gretchen and B.B.
386,00:14:50.47,00:14:50.47," Team two was myself,    Jenna and Gervase,"
387,00:14:53.13,00:14:53.13,"  and then, the third team   was Colleen and Joel."
388,00:14:57.00,00:14:57.00,  If you were to describe your   favorite lovemaking position
389,00:15:00.57,00:15:00.57,"   as a food,"
390,00:15:01.77,00:15:01.77,"  um, which food would that be and why?"
391,00:15:06.53,00:15:06.53,Oh...
392,00:15:07.77,00:15:07.77,Dude! Answer the question!
393,00:15:09.93,00:15:09.93,"I'm thinking, like, Good & Plenty."
394,00:15:12.63,00:15:12.63,I don't know.
395,00:15:14.57,00:15:14.57, ( shrieks )
396,00:15:16.77,00:15:16.77,Excellent.
397,00:15:18.67,00:15:18.67,"RAMONA:   And so, of course,     Greg was the host"
398,00:15:20.43,00:15:20.43, and he's just so wacky.
399,00:15:21.87,00:15:21.87,  I love this guy.
400,00:15:24.07,00:15:24.07," Like, no matter what,     he will have you laughing"
401,00:15:26.67,00:15:26.67," at least, like,     five times a day."
402,00:15:29.17,00:15:29.17,  ( laughing )
403,00:15:31.57,00:15:31.57,  And completely unpalatable.
404,00:15:34.17,00:15:34.17, That is such a relief  to have somebody there
405,00:15:37.50,00:15:37.50," that's, like, the icebreaker."
406,00:15:41.03,00:15:41.03," GREG:  On to our next category, then."
407,00:16:02.47,00:16:02.47,Did you sleep last night worrying about this thing?
408,00:16:05.27,00:16:05.27,"I mean, I got reason to worry."
409,00:16:07.37,00:16:07.37,"   GRETCHEN:  When we first got here, we started arguing, B.B. and I,"
410,00:16:10.40,00:16:10.40, about where to put the shelter    and I thought it should be
411,00:16:13.40,00:16:13.40,"  up in the canopy, you know,"
412,00:16:14.90,00:16:14.90," out of the sun    and with some protection,"
413,00:16:16.93,00:16:16.93,  and he thought it should be    down on the beach.
414,00:16:19.23,00:16:19.23, B.B.:    Idle water won't hurt us.
415,00:16:21.80,00:16:21.80,   GRETCHEN:  This morning we woke up
416,00:16:23.43,00:16:23.43,  and we saw that the moon     was not yet full
417,00:16:25.53,00:16:25.53,   and high tide came almost to our doorstep.
418,00:16:27.87,00:16:27.87,B.B.: This is going to be a breakwater.
419,00:16:31.00,00:16:31.00,I want to get down there   far enough to where
420,00:16:33.60,00:16:33.60, the waves will come up over it and start dumping sand.
421,00:16:37.43,00:16:37.43,"One, two, three."
422,00:16:38.60,00:16:38.60,B.B.: I already had my end up on two.
423,00:16:39.83,00:16:39.83, We started bringing logs down
424,00:16:43.47,00:16:43.47,   and keep the waves from breaking on the hut
425,00:16:45.33,00:16:45.33,"   'cause it's going to wash away the support posts,"
426,00:16:47.77,00:16:47.77,   and so he admitted  that maybe I was right
427,00:16:49.43,00:16:49.43," about putting it back further, he said"
428,00:16:51.37,00:16:51.37,  but he still doesn't    want it up in the canopy.
429,00:16:53.33,00:16:53.33,"Said he never will sleep up there, so..."
430,00:16:55.03,00:16:55.03,"  All right,   hold it, Greg."
431,00:16:56.77,00:16:56.77,Right in there.
432,00:16:58.40,00:16:58.40,We're right in.
433,00:16:59.43,00:16:59.43,All the way over now.
434,00:17:01.17,00:17:01.17,  Walk straight in   towards the hutch.
435,00:17:02.73,00:17:02.73,   Damn it. Walk    straight in.
436,00:17:05.37,00:17:05.37,"Okay, stop."
437,00:17:06.73,00:17:06.73,  Put it down.   Put it down.
438,00:17:07.87,00:17:07.87,  ( screams )
439,00:17:09.90,00:17:09.90,"   Okay, steady."
440,00:17:13.97,00:17:13.97,"  No, no, no. Everybody,   let's don't rush this."
441,00:17:16.10,00:17:16.10, B.B.:  But I think that's  the way it ought to be.
442,00:17:17.83,00:17:17.83," Well, you can  disagree without being smart."
443,00:17:19.40,00:17:19.40,"Well, how many times do we have to say it?"
444,00:17:21.70,00:17:21.70,  I know; that's   not right.
445,00:17:22.87,00:17:22.87,"Well, it may not be that right,"
446,00:17:24.53,00:17:24.53,   but how many times we got  to say-- make those decisions?
447,00:17:26.57,00:17:26.57,"B.B., I thought we were"
448,00:17:28.80,00:17:28.80,going to double up...
449,00:17:30.00,00:17:30.00,   We did.    We doubled up
450,00:17:31.00,00:17:31.00, off three feet.
451,00:17:32.20,00:17:32.20,That's not going to do it.
452,00:17:34.93,00:17:34.93,"   Yes, it will."
453,00:17:36.07,00:17:36.07," JOEL:  You know, if the sky was blue"
454,00:17:37.80,00:17:37.80, and I said it was blue
455,00:17:39.37,00:17:39.37,  he'd say it was red     just to disagree.
456,00:17:40.60,00:17:40.60, I can't let it  bring me down anymore.
457,00:17:44.17,00:17:44.17,"If we're building a health gym,    a health facility,"
458,00:17:46.90,00:17:46.90,I'll let you do it.
459,00:17:48.93,00:17:48.93,"  So, if we're going   to have kids,   that's my job."
460,00:17:50.80,00:17:50.80,What does that mean?
461,00:17:52.13,00:17:52.13," I mean, remarks  like that do  not help."
462,00:17:56.27,00:17:56.27,He makes   all of these great promises
463,00:17:58.70,00:17:58.70,"and-and of what    he's going to do,"
464,00:18:00.57,00:18:00.57,like catch fish and do everything else.
465,00:18:03.17,00:18:03.17, He has not performed one thing     he said he'd do.
466,00:18:05.80,00:18:05.80,  He reminds me of a guy that
467,00:18:07.43,00:18:07.43,  when you buy him    for what he's worth
468,00:18:09.13,00:18:09.13,"  and sell him  for what he thinks he's worth,"
469,00:18:11.30,00:18:11.30, you'd make $1 million.
470,00:18:12.63,00:18:12.63,  I meant   significant water.
471,00:18:14.27,00:18:14.27," GREG:  Well, I think     they knock heads."
472,00:18:16.23,00:18:16.23,  B.B.'s very strong-willed   and Joel is as well.
473,00:18:18.97,00:18:18.97, They don't back down     from one another
474,00:18:21.10,00:18:21.10,and that causes   a bit of friction--
475,00:18:23.10,00:18:23.10,  a bit of chafing if you want    to put it in island terms.
476,00:18:30.63,00:18:30.63,We got a float.
477,00:18:31.87,00:18:31.87,I'm definitely catching a fish today.
478,00:18:35.47,00:18:35.47,   Sea bass or salmon
479,00:18:36.93,00:18:36.93,  or whatever the hell  we can get out of this ocean.
480,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17, Fish is a priority right now.
481,00:18:40.27,00:18:40.27, Fish is very much a priority.
482,00:18:42.13,00:18:42.13," Now that we have the fire, we   need something to cook it in."
483,00:18:44.93,00:18:44.93,"Hey, where's super pole?"
484,00:18:47.37,00:18:47.37,This is so super pole.
485,00:18:48.70,00:18:48.70,Look at this-- I got the man's grip.
486,00:18:51.23,00:18:51.23,  Where's your hook?
487,00:18:52.27,00:18:52.27,We're working-- it's right underneath.
488,00:18:54.37,00:18:54.37,This sinker's a free-floating float and all I do
489,00:18:56.83,00:18:56.83,"is I take the line out, line out,"
490,00:18:58.67,00:18:58.67,cast home that super pole.
491,00:19:00.60,00:19:00.60,Then I reel in the big one.
492,00:19:04.67,00:19:04.67,Not too shabby.
493,00:19:11.63,00:19:11.63, SUSAN:  Sean sits there for five hours  and builds a super pole
494,00:19:15.53,00:19:15.53,   and doesn't catch anything with it.
495,00:19:24.53,00:19:24.53, SEAN:   Been fishing all day today    and still nothing.
496,00:19:28.03,00:19:28.03,  I don't even get a nibble.
497,00:19:30.00,00:19:30.00," So that's, you know,  really dissatisfying."
498,00:19:31.90,00:19:31.90," Get anything, Stacey?"
499,00:19:34.60,00:19:34.60,  No.
500,00:19:36.60,00:19:36.60, SUSAN:   I told him  it was a waste of time.
501,00:19:38.93,00:19:38.93,"   ""Oh, no, it's not    a waste of time."""
502,00:19:40.53,00:19:40.53,"   ""Did you catch any fish?"""
503,00:19:41.60,00:19:41.60," ""No."""
504,00:19:42.73,00:19:42.73,"RICHARD:    He's, um, really"
505,00:19:43.83,00:19:43.83, wanting to get fish.
506,00:19:45.27,00:19:45.27," Hadn't been able to bring any in, and I think that was"
507,00:19:47.40,00:19:47.40,really starting to eat at him.
508,00:19:48.70,00:19:48.70,  Maybe the area's overfished  or something.
509,00:19:50.47,00:19:50.47,  We'll figure it out     sooner or later.
510,00:19:57.93,00:19:57.93, ( chuckling )
511,00:19:59.00,00:19:59.00, ( indistinct talking )
512,00:20:03.00,00:20:03.00,You washing your clothes in our food container?
513,00:20:07.80,00:20:07.80,He's washing his clothes in freshwater.
514,00:20:10.17,00:20:10.17,He's washing his clothes
515,00:20:11.70,00:20:11.70,with the canteen water?
516,00:20:12.87,00:20:12.87," Yeah. It's unbelievable, man."
517,00:20:14.67,00:20:14.67," JOEL:  When we get back, we're going to make some rice, we're happy."
518,00:20:17.40,00:20:17.40,  First thing he does is he washes his T-shirt
519,00:20:21.27,00:20:21.27,   in the kettle we're going   to cook the rice in.
520,00:20:23.87,00:20:23.87,Every canteen was empty    and the sun's going down.
521,00:20:26.13,00:20:26.13, It's starting to rain.
522,00:20:27.57,00:20:27.57,"   When are we going to get water, you know?"
523,00:20:29.17,00:20:29.17,You think I have time to go now?
524,00:20:30.97,00:20:30.97,  No.
525,00:20:32.07,00:20:32.07,"  I wasn't sure I'd have time,"
526,00:20:33.27,00:20:33.27, so it's stupid to go up there.
527,00:20:34.83,00:20:34.83," There's places where you can, you know,"
528,00:20:36.67,00:20:36.67,  it's wet now  'cause it was raining
529,00:20:38.13,00:20:38.13,and you can barely walk.
530,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,"  She's a little upset, too,"
531,00:20:40.63,00:20:40.63,that...
532,00:20:41.77,00:20:41.77,The freshwater for some cleansing supplies.
533,00:20:43.60,00:20:43.60, Yeah.
534,00:20:45.37,00:20:45.37,  I thought we would   discuss this
535,00:20:46.77,00:20:46.77, from the beginning.
536,00:20:48.40,00:20:48.40,"  Before anybody   does anything,   we got to vote"
537,00:20:50.63,00:20:50.63,on whatever we're doing.
538,00:20:52.07,00:20:52.07,   Now that's a    canteen of water.
539,00:20:53.47,00:20:53.47,   But you can't    just do that.
540,00:20:54.47,00:20:54.47,We can't go back
541,00:20:55.77,00:20:55.77,to the water hole tonight because we'll get lost.
542,00:20:57.97,00:20:57.97, I don't mind. I'll go.
543,00:20:58.97,00:20:58.97,"No, we can't."
544,00:21:00.10,00:21:00.10,It's getting dark and it's raining.
545,00:21:01.53,00:21:01.53,...then you're hurt.
546,00:21:01.53,00:21:01.53,Why?
547,00:21:02.97,00:21:02.97,"   If you get hurt,    then we all lose."
548,00:21:04.00,00:21:04.00,  But that's not   the point.
549,00:21:05.80,00:21:05.80, B.B.:    I'm not going to get hurt   if I go after water.
550,00:21:06.80,00:21:06.80,"   B.B., please. B.B."
551,00:21:07.80,00:21:07.80,"It is not about ""I."" It's about us."
552,00:21:10.03,00:21:10.03,   I'm not arguing.
553,00:21:10.03,00:21:10.03,You're missing the whole point.
554,00:21:11.87,00:21:11.87, You're the one    who brought it up.
555,00:21:12.87,00:21:12.87,  I didn't say a word.
556,00:21:13.87,00:21:13.87,"You know, if that was your canteen"
557,00:21:15.07,00:21:15.07,that's cool. There you go.
558,00:21:16.90,00:21:16.90,"   I don't even know if that's cool,"
559,00:21:18.57,00:21:18.57, because if you get dehydrated
560,00:21:20.60,00:21:20.60,"and we have to compete,   we all lose."
561,00:21:22.67,00:21:22.67, I'm not imposing my...
562,00:21:24.23,00:21:24.23, You can't do anything here  without everybody agreeing.
563,00:21:25.87,00:21:25.87, We all have to agree  what we're going to do.
564,00:21:27.53,00:21:27.53, That's the whole thing.
565,00:21:28.53,00:21:28.53,I've been working my ass off
566,00:21:30.00,00:21:30.00,"and the lot of you have been laying on your ass watching me,"
567,00:21:32.00,00:21:32.00,so don't give me any of that ...
568,00:21:33.37,00:21:33.37, Everyone's been  working their  ass off.
569,00:21:34.50,00:21:34.50,Bull ... Bull ...
570,00:21:36.17,00:21:36.17,"   Hey, we've    all been working."
571,00:21:37.17,00:21:37.17,I've worked 20 times as much as you.
572,00:21:38.77,00:21:38.77," I'm not faulting you,"
573,00:21:40.43,00:21:40.43,   but when you start getting    on my ass about working...
574,00:21:41.67,00:21:41.67,  That's what you think.
575,00:21:42.87,00:21:42.87,You didn't take one trek in this jungle yet.
576,00:21:44.87,00:21:44.87,   Your ass has been    sitting down here    chillin'.
577,00:21:46.67,00:21:46.67,"GERVASE:  If B.B. thinks anybody     on our tribe is slacking,"
578,00:21:47.67,00:21:47.67,   the heat is affecting him.
579,00:21:49.00,00:21:49.00, Everybody on our tribe is working hard.
580,00:21:51.07,00:21:51.07,"   I mean, everybody   has different jobs."
581,00:21:52.77,00:21:52.77,  Building the shelter   is probably the hardest job.
582,00:21:55.17,00:21:55.17,   He took that challenge on
583,00:21:56.73,00:21:56.73,  so somebody going out there    trying to catch some fish
584,00:21:58.97,00:21:58.97," might not look that important,"
585,00:22:00.40,00:22:00.40,  but it's just as important.
586,00:22:01.90,00:22:01.90,   I didn't want this    to turn into this.
587,00:22:03.10,00:22:03.10,  It's going to turn   into this.
588,00:22:05.10,00:22:05.10,"You knew it was. I mean, there's no other way around it."
589,00:22:08.03,00:22:08.03, This is the meeting we were talking about
590,00:22:09.67,00:22:09.67,we needed to have.
591,00:22:11.10,00:22:11.10, You can't be making decisions   on your own.
592,00:22:13.27,00:22:13.27,"I'll try to at least get  all eight of us here for this,"
593,00:22:15.70,00:22:15.70,  and then we'll talk.
594,00:22:16.70,00:22:16.70, I'm going after water.
595,00:22:18.30,00:22:18.30, B.B.:  I'm not voting  when I wash my clothes.
596,00:22:19.87,00:22:19.87,  No one's going to tell me  when I can do stuff like that.
597,00:22:22.97,00:22:22.97," First place,     this is not a democracy."
598,00:22:25.43,00:22:25.43,"  I'll vote on things    that don't matter,"
599,00:22:27.33,00:22:27.33,"  but things that matter, uh,    and my survival..."
600,00:22:32.83,00:22:32.83,"   and... my comfort,  I'm not going to vote."
601,00:22:41.30,00:22:41.30, Throughout their time  on the island
602,00:22:42.93,00:22:42.93,the tribes will compete    in a series of challenges.
603,00:22:45.73,00:22:45.73,They'll receive messages  notifying them
604,00:22:48.07,00:22:48.07, of these competitions   at their tree mail.
605,00:22:51.10,00:22:51.10,"  Lose, face Tribal Council    where you must vote"
606,00:22:54.53,00:22:54.53,  one member off the island.
607,00:22:56.73,00:22:56.73,You did?
608,00:22:58.10,00:22:58.10,   We got something.
609,00:22:59.47,00:22:59.47,  ( chuckles )
610,00:23:00.93,00:23:00.93,"  Info, info."

617,00:23:22.70,00:23:22.70,Oh! Can you imagine?!
618,00:23:24.73,00:23:24.73,I bet you're right.
619,00:23:26.57,00:23:26.57,   Eating disgusting things.
620,00:23:28.53,00:23:28.53,  ( groans )
621,00:23:29.53,00:23:29.53,   I don't know.
622,00:23:31.07,00:23:31.07,   I'm going to pull out    some of the maps.
623,00:23:35.63,00:23:35.63,Eating bugs. We're going
624,00:23:37.17,00:23:37.17,to be eating some bugs tonight.
625,00:23:40.07,00:23:40.07,"   Come on, man. I love bugs."
626,00:23:41.80,00:23:41.80,  I know you do.
627,00:23:42.83,00:23:42.83,Huh?
628,00:23:50.77,00:23:50.77," RUDY:  ""And will be served al fresco"
629,00:23:54.23,00:23:54.23,"in the shadow of the banyan tree   along the Lari-Lari trail."""
630,00:24:00.53,00:24:00.53,"   Hmm, sounds tasty."
631,00:24:03.93,00:24:03.93,"  Oh, I'll swallow everything."
632,00:24:05.73,00:24:05.73,You won't even eat rice.
633,00:24:07.47,00:24:07.47, What are you talking about?
634,00:24:09.07,00:24:09.07,   This is for immunity.    That's different.
635,00:24:10.53,00:24:10.53, Let's have a little  strategy meeting
636,00:24:14.83,00:24:14.83,for the immunity challenge.
637,00:24:18.13,00:24:18.13,Okay.
638,00:24:19.13,00:24:19.13,I think we ought to consider how
639,00:24:21.27,00:24:21.27,   we're going to do it.
640,00:24:22.37,00:24:22.37, Whether we even  want to win it.
641,00:24:24.40,00:24:24.40,   'Cause I think...
642,00:24:25.40,00:24:25.40,"Yes, we want to win it."
643,00:24:26.43,00:24:26.43,"No, I want to talk about it"
644,00:24:28.20,00:24:28.20,   'cause I think    we ought to think
645,00:24:30.13,00:24:30.13,about lightening the load here.
646,00:24:32.50,00:24:32.50," I'm not going to quit,"
647,00:24:34.03,00:24:34.03, but if I can engineer    an escape route for myself
648,00:24:37.20,00:24:37.20,"and do it right, do it ethically   and do it correctly,"
649,00:24:40.50,00:24:40.50,"then, sure, I'll do it."
650,00:24:42.00,00:24:42.00,   I don't agree with that...
651,00:24:44.00,00:24:44.00,  with quitting or engineering   something just to save face.
652,00:24:48.57,00:24:48.57,  I think he's trying   to save face
653,00:24:50.43,00:24:50.43,before getting voted off
654,00:24:51.80,00:24:51.80, because I don't think he would have come here
655,00:24:53.83,00:24:53.83, if that was the case.
656,00:24:55.23,00:24:55.23,"  What's the point of coming   all this way,"
657,00:24:57.03,00:24:57.03,  going through all the crap
658,00:24:58.40,00:24:58.40," we had to go through   to get here,"
659,00:24:59.97,00:24:59.97,  for you to all of a sudden  decide
660,00:25:01.60,00:25:01.60,that you want to get voted off.
661,00:25:03.57,00:25:03.57,"   B.B., you can put    up with this"
662,00:25:04.93,00:25:04.93,for a little longer.
663,00:25:06.07,00:25:06.07,The name of the game is to reduce the tribe.
664,00:25:09.23,00:25:09.23,The name of the game is to stay together
665,00:25:11.50,00:25:11.50, as long as you can.
666,00:25:12.80,00:25:12.80,"   Yeah, to survive."
667,00:25:14.23,00:25:14.23, To survive.
668,00:25:15.33,00:25:15.33,"Sometimes strategy-wise, it might be best."
669,00:25:17.97,00:25:17.97,"   You have a chance    to go, everyone."
670,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,"Oh, I understand that,"
671,00:25:20.43,00:25:20.43,but I'm just saying
672,00:25:21.83,00:25:21.83,I think we ought to at least decide
673,00:25:23.70,00:25:23.70,what we want to do.
674,00:25:25.13,00:25:25.13, We want to win.
675,00:25:26.20,00:25:26.20,Win.
676,00:25:27.27,00:25:27.27,Then the subject's closed.
677,00:25:28.60,00:25:28.60, JEFF:   This is the immunity idol.
678,00:25:32.30,00:25:32.30,  The tribe holding the idol
679,00:25:33.93,00:25:33.93, does not have to hike     to Tribal Council
680,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,  and vote one of their own  off the island.
681,00:25:40.23,00:25:40.23, The Pagong Tribe won  last week's immunity challenge
682,00:25:43.10,00:25:43.10,"  ""Quest for Fire."""
683,00:25:44.83,00:25:44.83,  We're just not going to let this out!

685,00:25:53.57,00:25:53.57,  and immunity from tonight's  Tribal Council.
686,00:25:58.00,00:25:58.00," Yeah, baby!"
687,00:25:59.63,00:25:59.63,( all cheering )
688,00:26:01.97,00:26:01.97,JEFF: Welcome.

693,00:26:09.03,00:26:09.03, How's it going?
694,00:26:11.87,00:26:11.87,"  Pagong, thanks   for bringing back   the immunity idol."
695,00:26:14.00,00:26:14.00,It's up for grabs again.
696,00:26:15.47,00:26:15.47,"Losing tribe, you know the drill."
697,00:26:16.90,00:26:16.90,"   You go to Tribal Council,"
698,00:26:18.20,00:26:18.20,"  one of your members gets voted off,"
699,00:26:19.73,00:26:19.73, not a fun place to go.
700,00:26:21.77,00:26:21.77,I know you guys probably   been six days without food.
701,00:26:23.93,00:26:23.93,"So, I went out,  I looked long and hard"
702,00:26:25.40,00:26:25.40, to find a true local delicacy.
703,00:26:28.67,00:26:28.67,"And we turned it  into an immunity competition,"
704,00:26:30.63,00:26:30.63,so let me just give you    a visual.
705,00:26:31.67,00:26:31.67,"Oh, God."
706,00:26:32.90,00:26:32.90,  Gross!
707,00:26:34.67,00:26:34.67,"  Yeah. In Borneo,   this is considered   like sushi."
708,00:26:36.70,00:26:36.70,   ( cheering and groaning )
709,00:26:41.63,00:26:41.63,"   Everybody, just take one."
710,00:26:42.80,00:26:42.80,"Now, these will swim away."
711,00:26:43.90,00:26:43.90, Gerv's going to  have to eat it!
712,00:26:49.07,00:26:49.07,  JEFF:   Put it on   your plate
713,00:26:50.27,00:26:50.27,  and don't let   it crawl away.

723,00:27:08.70,00:27:08.70,  are simple:

727,00:27:17.47,00:27:17.47, off the island   at tonight's Tribal Council.

844,00:30:55.17,00:30:55.17, You'll wash them in that bowl;  you'll put them in your bowl.

890,00:32:12.30,00:32:12.30,  was eating those two bugs

911,00:33:15.23,00:33:15.23,"   I mean, you have to stand    in judgment of your maker,"

914,00:33:26.27,00:33:26.27,  My length of stay   on the island depends
915,00:33:28.50,00:33:28.50," on either what, like,   somebody thinks of me"
916,00:33:31.17,00:33:31.17, or what they don't think of me    or of my abilities.

918,00:33:35.70,00:33:35.70,"but I kind of like to be  in control of things,"
919,00:33:37.97,00:33:37.97, and I have no control    over whether I stay or go.
920,00:33:40.23,00:33:40.23,My vote would be I would vote Ramona off
921,00:33:42.80,00:33:42.80,because B.B. is such a great wor... gets us up.
922,00:33:46.03,00:33:46.03,He... We're moving stuff   this morning and everything.
923,00:33:48.27,00:33:48.27,"I mean,    we're getting things done"

927,00:33:53.43,00:33:53.43, Ramona was back in bed.

929,00:33:56.20,00:33:56.20,  B.B. will be the first one voted off.
930,00:33:58.10,00:33:58.10,   I think he pretty much...  he dug his own grave.
931,00:34:00.40,00:34:00.40,Now he's saying he wants to go.
932,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33," So, if that's what he wants,   that's fine."
933,00:34:04.97,00:34:04.97, B.B.:  The first two people   that I would consider voting
934,00:34:08.43,00:34:08.43," out of here, besides myself,  would be, uh..."
935,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,"Joel and, uh... Ramona."

941,00:34:23.73,00:34:23.73,I think we-we've bonded already.
942,00:34:25.33,00:34:25.33, I think that's how everybody   was feeling.

944,00:34:30.07,00:34:30.07, and some people didn't.
945,00:34:31.67,00:34:31.67,I'm going to take my chopsticks with me.
946,00:34:33.67,00:34:33.67,Maybe somebody needs chopsticks.
947,00:34:35.60,00:34:35.60,  I can sell them on the side
948,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20,and make a little extra money.

953,00:34:47.27,00:34:47.27, B.B.: They got to think long and hard  before they vote me out
954,00:34:50.40,00:34:50.40, because I think    I contribute a lot.

995,00:36:40.43,00:36:40.43,"   monitor lizards, snakes--"
996,00:36:41.60,00:36:41.60,but it's not by accident
997,00:36:43.10,00:36:43.10, the Tribal Council is located  in the center of the jungle.
998,00:36:46.70,00:36:46.70,"  What happens here is sacred,  needs to be respected."
999,00:36:50.43,00:36:50.43,The way you've handled yourself  will either come back
1000,00:36:53.10,00:36:53.10,"  to help you,"
1001,00:36:54.37,00:36:54.37,"  or it may come back  to haunt you,"
1002,00:36:56.03,00:36:56.03,   but those actions    will play a part
1003,00:36:57.23,00:36:57.23,   as we'll find out tonight.
1004,00:36:59.13,00:36:59.13," If you look over here,"
1005,00:37:00.93,00:37:00.93,  you'll see the only
1006,00:37:02.77,00:37:02.77,   unlit staff on this ruin.
1007,00:37:04.40,00:37:04.40,That represents Sonja--
1008,00:37:06.13,00:37:06.13,the first person  voted off the island.
1009,00:37:08.47,00:37:08.47,"  Tonight, one of you"
1010,00:37:09.77,00:37:09.77,"  will have your flame  extinguished,"
1011,00:37:12.30,00:37:12.30, and you will go home.
1012,00:37:14.13,00:37:14.13," It's tough, but that's  the nature of Tribal Council,"
1013,00:37:17.20,00:37:17.20,  the way it's set up.
1014,00:37:18.30,00:37:18.30," So, before we get to the vote,"
1015,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,"  Colleen, what was your take"
1016,00:37:22.27,00:37:22.27,   on what went down in terms
1017,00:37:24.10,00:37:24.10, of who stepped forward    to take the reins?
1018,00:37:25.47,00:37:25.47,"I mean, I think we have"
1019,00:37:27.17,00:37:27.17,"  two or three strong leaders    in our group, definitely,"
1020,00:37:30.27,00:37:30.27,"  and they took, uh..."
1021,00:37:31.77,00:37:31.77,"   they guided the rest of us into, uh, doing the right things"
1022,00:37:35.40,00:37:35.40,  and getting everything done.
1023,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,"I mean, we have a great place now,"
1024,00:37:38.90,00:37:38.90,"thanks to them, I think."
1025,00:37:41.57,00:37:41.57,"   Gervase, what are you    feeling right now"
1026,00:37:43.50,00:37:43.50," first time at Tribal Council,"
1027,00:37:45.10,00:37:45.10,   knowing what you're going  to have to do tonight?
1028,00:37:47.27,00:37:47.27,   I-I just feel bad.
1029,00:37:48.60,00:37:48.60,"You know, I kind of feel like I let my team down"
1030,00:37:51.07,00:37:51.07," by, uh... not winning,    but, uh..."
1031,00:37:54.47,00:37:54.47," I mean, that's-that's    really about it, you know."
1032,00:37:57.83,00:37:57.83, I-I just wish  we kicked their butt.
1033,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,"Didn't happen that way, you know, but..."
1034,00:38:02.90,00:38:02.90,"  JEFF:   Jenna, you've been   a little bit"
1035,00:38:04.47,00:38:04.47,of a cheerleader for the group.
1036,00:38:06.07,00:38:06.07,"So, how does this play for you,"
1037,00:38:07.97,00:38:07.97,"   coming over here,  having to vote one person off?"
1038,00:38:10.57,00:38:10.57,  It's unfair.
1039,00:38:12.30,00:38:12.30,"  We've really bonded, so to kick one of us off"
1040,00:38:15.13,00:38:15.13,"is like losing a family member,    and then it's going to be"
1041,00:38:18.93,00:38:18.93,"  a large, empty gap   in the bed tonight."
1042,00:38:21.27,00:38:21.27,  All right.
1043,00:38:22.83,00:38:22.83, Let me explain  how the voting works.
1044,00:38:24.70,00:38:24.70,"One by one, starting with B.B.,   you come along here,"
1045,00:38:27.40,00:38:27.40, go across  this bridge
1046,00:38:28.77,00:38:28.77, into our voting  confessional.
1047,00:38:31.07,00:38:31.07,   There's a piece of paper.
1048,00:38:32.17,00:38:32.17,   You need to write the name
1049,00:38:33.47,00:38:33.47, of the person    you're voting off
1050,00:38:34.50,00:38:34.50," in large, clear  block letters."
1051,00:38:36.53,00:38:36.53, Hold it up.
1052,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,   Speak your piece.
1053,00:38:38.87,00:38:38.87,  All right.
1054,00:38:40.27,00:38:40.27,   It's time to vote.
1055,00:38:41.27,00:38:41.27,"B.B., you're up."
1056,00:38:42.57,00:38:42.57,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1057,00:39:02.70,00:39:02.70,"B.B.:  Uh, I think that  this, uh, person contributed"
1058,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,  probably the least of anyone  in all of our efforts.
1059,00:39:11.40,00:39:11.40,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1060,00:39:19.70,00:39:19.70,I chose B.B. 'cause he was like   a get-out-of-jail-free card.
1061,00:39:22.80,00:39:22.80,"He said that he was ready to go,"
1062,00:39:24.73,00:39:24.73," and he'd done   what he came to do,"
1063,00:39:26.37,00:39:26.37,  and he might not have been  my first choice
1064,00:39:28.63,00:39:28.63," if he wasn't ready to go home,"
1065,00:39:30.17,00:39:30.17, because he certainly     is a hard worker
1066,00:39:31.90,00:39:31.90,and he kicked some butt.
1067,00:39:33.97,00:39:33.97,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1068,00:39:55.13,00:39:55.13,  I think it's time     for Ramona to go.
1069,00:39:57.23,00:39:57.23,"  She's a strong challenger,   but it seems like she, uh..."
1070,00:40:01.10,00:40:01.10, she doesn't want to be a part of the...
1071,00:40:03.53,00:40:03.53,  or is struggling with being  part of the group life
1072,00:40:06.73,00:40:06.73,  that we have there.
1073,00:40:08.10,00:40:08.10,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1074,00:40:28.27,00:40:28.27,"  Uh, I voted him off    because he's about"
1075,00:40:32.10,00:40:32.10,the only choice    we had right now.
1076,00:40:33.90,00:40:33.90,"   Uh, we all talked   about other ones, but, uh..."
1077,00:40:36.20,00:40:36.20,"   right now,    he's just the best choice"
1078,00:40:37.70,00:40:37.70, because we have to win  the next competitions.
1079,00:40:39.77,00:40:39.77,"Unfortunately, we had to do it."
1080,00:40:41.43,00:40:41.43,"  Sorry, man."
1081,00:40:44.13,00:40:44.13,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1082,00:40:55.97,00:40:55.97," JEFF: Well, obviously, there are a lot"
1083,00:40:58.37,00:40:58.37,   of reasons  why you guys are here.
1084,00:41:00.40,00:41:00.40,"   $1 million, enough reason  probably for anybody,"
1085,00:41:02.93,00:41:02.93,  and I'm sure  there are some of you
1086,00:41:05.20,00:41:05.20, who may have different reasons  or additional reasons.
1087,00:41:07.37,00:41:07.37,"Regardless, to achieve your goal"
1088,00:41:09.23,00:41:09.23,  you have to survive    tonight's Tribal Council.
1089,00:41:11.40,00:41:11.40,   One of you won't.
1090,00:41:12.40,00:41:12.40,I'll go tally the votes.
1091,00:41:26.57,00:41:26.57,"Before I read the votes,"
1092,00:41:27.97,00:41:27.97,"I just want to say that once the decision has been made,"
1093,00:41:31.00,00:41:31.00,  it is final.
1094,00:41:32.00,00:41:32.00,"  I'll guide you through this,"
1095,00:41:33.43,00:41:33.43,  but you'll be asked to leave the island immediately.
1096,00:41:36.10,00:41:36.10, No good-byes.
1097,00:41:37.43,00:41:37.43,"   All right,  let's count the votes."
1098,00:41:45.47,00:41:45.47,"   First vote: ""B.B."""
1099,00:41:51.77,00:41:51.77,"   ""Ramona."""
1100,00:42:00.23,00:42:00.23," ""B.B."""
1101,00:42:02.80,00:42:02.80,"   ""Ramona."""
1102,00:42:05.83,00:42:05.83,"  That's two votes for Ramona,    two votes for B.B."
1103,00:42:10.43,00:42:10.43," ""B.B."""
1104,00:42:19.27,00:42:19.27," ""B.B."""
1105,00:42:25.60,00:42:25.60," ""B.B."""
1106,00:42:27.30,00:42:27.30,  The last vote   is irrelevant.
1107,00:42:28.93,00:42:28.93,"B.B., I need to have you grab your torch"
1108,00:42:31.23,00:42:31.23, and bring it to me.
1109,00:42:35.37,00:42:35.37,Go ahead and slide over here.
1110,00:42:45.87,00:42:45.87," B.B., the tribe  has spoken."
1111,00:42:54.47,00:42:54.47,  It's time   for you to go.
1112,00:42:56.07,00:42:56.07,   All right.
1113,00:42:57.27,00:42:57.27,Good-bye.
1114,00:43:08.37,00:43:08.37," JEFF:   To the rest of you,   uh, congratulations."
1115,00:43:10.33,00:43:10.33,  You survived    your first Tribal Council.
1116,00:43:12.77,00:43:12.77,"   Not a fun process,"
1117,00:43:14.13,00:43:14.13,but one you'll have to do again.
1118,00:43:16.67,00:43:16.67,   You can take your torches  and head back to camp.
1119,00:43:19.80,00:43:19.80,  \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
1120,00:43:41.93,00:43:41.93, Next week on Survivor:
1121,00:43:44.13,00:43:44.13, My testimony is not something   I'm afraid to share.
1122,00:43:46.57,00:43:46.57,"   When Christ came,"
1123,00:43:47.97,00:43:47.97,   he opened the door  to every human being.
1124,00:43:49.87,00:43:49.87, I can only take    so much preaching.
1125,00:43:51.43,00:43:51.43,  Dirk's about driving me wild    with that.
1126,00:43:52.87,00:43:52.87," The ""oomph"" is a little gone."
1127,00:43:54.40,00:43:54.40,I think that not eating is a factor of our mood.
1128,00:43:56.83,00:43:56.83,  I'm so ready to eat rat.
1129,00:43:58.80,00:43:58.80,"  I want to gut him, bone him  and..."
1130,00:44:00.10,00:44:00.10, Surf and turf.
1131,00:44:01.10,00:44:01.10,   Minnows and rats.
1132,00:44:07.57,00:44:07.57,I'm a little sad  to leave these people
1133,00:44:10.87,00:44:10.87,"because after the last six days,"
1134,00:44:12.43,00:44:12.43," you know, we've gotten pretty close, all of us."
1135,00:44:14.60,00:44:14.60,  There isn't anybody   in that group I don't like.
1136,00:44:16.73,00:44:16.73," Some I like more than others,    but that's normal."
1137,00:44:19.13,00:44:19.13, And I hope that I showed them   a little bit of work ethic;
1138,00:44:22.30,00:44:22.30, that I don't back off  from-from what I did.
1139,00:44:24.87,00:44:24.87,   I think what I did    was the right way.
