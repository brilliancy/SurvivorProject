193,00:13:47.12,00:13:47.12,and James.That tub looks the most
194,00:13:49.88,00:13:49.88,attractive to jump into rightnow.
195,00:13:52.83,00:13:52.83,That tub right there.>> I am so happy right now.
196,00:13:58.04,00:13:58.04,>> I tried my best to be as faraway from Jean-Robert in the
197,00:14:02.46,00:14:02.46,bathtub as could possibly happenin that place.
198,00:14:06.00,00:14:06.00,"He had the one on the far end,I took the one on the other far"
199,00:14:08.46,00:14:08.46,end.He's kind of gross.
200,00:14:10.50,00:14:10.50,Every single part of me wants tosee Jean-Robert go.
201,00:14:13.08,00:14:13.08,I just don't like him.He's a horrible person.
202,00:14:21.08,00:14:21.08,">> Oh, there we go!We've got some butt action"
203,00:14:23.58,00:14:23.58,happening!>> Whoo!
204,00:14:26.12,00:14:26.12,">> Yeah!>> Yeah, James!"
205,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,">> Don't tease me, James!Don't tease me!"
206,00:14:32.88,00:14:32.88,">> James has such a nice butt.He was in the shower, lathering"

209,00:14:42.25,00:14:42.25,"I mean, he might as well show itoff."
210,00:14:44.46,00:14:44.46,>> Why y'all messing with me?>> I'll speak for myself.
211,00:15:03.88,00:15:03.88,I'm tired of losing.>> We're so into keeping Sherea
212,00:15:31.67,00:15:31.67,"Frosti, Erik, Peih-Gee and Itogether."
213,00:15:34.50,00:15:34.50,We thought we would do anythingto save them-- we'd throw a
214,00:15:37.17,00:15:37.17,"challenge to save them.We did it, you know?"
215,00:15:40.38,00:15:40.38,But Frosti won't make eyecontact with us.
216,00:15:42.38,00:15:42.38,We don't know if he's changedhis mind and switched over with
217,00:15:44.54,00:15:44.54,"them.You know, everything's just"
218,00:15:47.17,00:15:47.17,"unknown, so it's really hard todeal with, especially when"
219,00:15:49.04,00:15:49.04,there's just three of us hereand there's so many over there.
220,00:15:52.00,00:15:52.00,">> Now I'm not sure about Frostiand Sherea, because that flips"
221,00:15:54.25,00:15:54.25,"everything.>> I mean, we have three right"
222,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,"here, three strong.That's great."
223,00:16:03.25,00:16:03.25,>> But it's not enough.>> This the best reward yet.
224,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,>> It's so nice to clean myfeet.

226,00:16:24.62,00:16:24.62,"throughout this game, I feellike I am the only one playing."
227,00:16:28.46,00:16:28.46,So I knew right away when wekidnapped James that I would

232,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,I hope it's worth it.I need something to save me.
233,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,I'm in a bad spot right now.Todd is the cornerstone to all
234,00:17:13.50,00:17:13.50,"the alliances on this tribe, soI'm going to roll with Todd and"
235,00:17:16.62,00:17:16.62,roll the old dice and maybe itwill come up right.
236,00:17:19.67,00:17:19.67,"If not, I'm pretty much goneanyway, so I have to do it."

240,00:17:57.75,00:17:57.75,It's those stupid bats above thefreakin' thing.
241,00:18:18.42,00:18:18.42,">> I went over where we thoughtthe idol would be, and I was"
242,00:18:20.75,00:18:20.75,just hitting off shingles sopeople didn't know what I was

244,00:18:25.46,00:18:25.46,">> Knock those down.>> He gets up there, and he"
245,00:18:33.33,00:18:33.33,"starts pulling on the thing.>> All of a sudden, Frosti comes"
246,00:18:47.75,00:18:47.75,"running over and climbs up, so Igo into panic mode of, ""He's"

248,00:18:52.25,00:18:52.25,"And Amanda's like, ""Get down,Frosti, get down, Frosti,"""
249,00:18:54.17,00:18:54.17,"because she knows about it.And I'm telling him to get down,"
250,00:19:02.54,00:19:02.54,"and I started panicking, and...Hey, hey, hey!"
251,00:19:15.00,00:19:15.00,"Wait, wait, wait!>> What?"
252,00:19:18.29,00:19:18.29,">> All I could think was Frosti,Frosti, no!"

256,00:19:43.88,00:19:43.88,I knew something like that wasgoing to happen.

264,00:20:29.54,00:20:29.54,"loses immunity, they vote forhim, but he uses the idol to get"
265,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,"rid of Jaime, we sever the tiebetween her and Erik."
266,00:20:37.54,00:20:37.54,"Hopefully, at ten we'll merge,and we'll still have our numbers"
267,00:20:40.21,00:20:40.21,"to go strong into the merge.Now, here's the way it works."

272,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,"And it's all good, because I'mnot going anywhere."
273,00:20:58.46,00:20:58.46,"I have the immunity idol.It's all good, baby."

459,00:31:58.25,00:31:58.25,us and this tonight will helphim trust us.
460,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,Does that make sense?Because we want to trust him
461,00:32:03.12,00:32:03.12,just as much as he wants totrust us.
462,00:32:06.25,00:32:06.25,">> I'm also coming to get water.>> Oh, good."

470,00:32:27.54,00:32:27.54,"But when I thought about for alittle while, I actually like"
471,00:32:30.71,00:32:30.71,Sharea.And if it came down to it of who
472,00:32:33.75,00:32:33.75,"I thought would vote me outquicker, I definitely think that"
473,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,she would keep me around longerthan Jean-Robert.
474,00:33:19.38,00:33:19.38,">> Well, right now, the peopleat Fei Long want me to go home."
475,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,What they don't understand isthey need to be scared of the

477,00:33:27.12,00:33:27.12,he'll vote any of them out.So the same time they're looking
478,00:33:30.88,00:33:30.88,"at me, they need to be scared ofeach other."

484,00:33:55.17,00:33:55.17,smarter move.>> Do you know what I mean?
485,00:34:06.38,00:34:06.38,>> It's the smarter idea rightnow to stick with more of our
486,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,"tribe.And honestly, it has to be"
487,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,Frosti or Sharea.>> Do you know what I mean?

490,00:34:25.50,00:34:25.50,And we have to look at thebigger picture of things.
491,00:34:28.42,00:34:28.42,">> The thing is, it's like, ourgreat plan didn't work today"
492,00:34:31.58,00:34:31.58,either.Do you know what I mean?

494,00:34:42.54,00:34:42.54,"Like, you can't predict what'sgoing to happen."
495,00:34:57.33,00:34:57.33,">> I like to trust my gut and myvibe, and so far, I've really"
496,00:35:01.62,00:35:01.62,felt comfortable about myposition in the game.
497,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,"All of a sudden, somethingdoesn't feel 100% to me."
498,00:35:10.46,00:35:10.46,"The plan was either Sherea orFrosti, most likely Sherea."
499,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,"But I've got to tell you, I'muneasy right now."
500,00:35:24.33,00:35:24.33,>> I feel like we should voteout Jean-Robert tonight.

502,00:35:28.00,00:35:28.00,We are lining ourselves up aspower players.
503,00:35:30.79,00:35:30.79,They will get rid of us if wedon't start doing what people
504,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,want.Because Jean-Robert is not
505,00:35:37.08,00:35:37.08,"stupid, and he will turn on us.He will."
506,00:35:41.79,00:35:41.79,">> Sharea will too.Todd, I don't know."
507,00:35:46.88,00:35:46.88,I think Jean-Robert definitelyhas to go.
508,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"I don't think now is the time,honestly."
509,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,">> I don't know what to do.>> Honestly, my gut feeling is"
