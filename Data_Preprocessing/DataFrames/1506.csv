34,00:02:16.50,00:02:16.50,>> I definitely feel confident about throwing the challenge and
35,00:02:19.62,00:02:19.62,getting Aaron off the game. He was one of the most powerful
36,00:02:22.46,00:02:22.46,"players, and suddenly we had full control of him, and we"
37,00:02:25.17,00:02:25.17,still have that over James. If we throw the next immunity
38,00:02:29.54,00:02:29.54,"challenge, James is going to be gone."
39,00:02:33.96,00:02:33.96,"Best possible scenario, we merge at that point."

43,00:02:48.42,00:02:48.42,right now. The best thing for me to do
44,00:02:53.88,00:02:53.88,"is to keep them rested so in competitions, there's no excuse"
45,00:02:57.21,00:02:57.21,of anybody being tired. It makes me look good in the
46,00:02:59.75,00:02:59.75,long run. They're going to keep me around.
47,00:03:02.08,00:03:02.08,So I'm trying to deal with it and make it work.
48,00:03:04.08,00:03:04.08,"Because if they throw another challenge, I'm gone."

50,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,It has to stay between us. There's a hidden immunity idol
51,00:04:37.29,00:04:37.29,"here at our camp. When we kidnap people, they give"

56,00:05:04.12,00:05:04.12,"to the immunity idol, which I was kind of shocked because I"
57,00:05:09.25,00:05:09.25,didn't know about any hidden immunity idol.
58,00:05:12.29,00:05:12.29,So we're going to do everything we can to find that idol today.
59,00:05:16.04,00:05:16.04,"We have to. >> If we win reward today, we"

61,00:05:25.67,00:05:25.67,because they're going to give us a clue as to where that hidden

194,00:13:47.12,00:13:47.12,and James. That tub looks the most
195,00:13:49.88,00:13:49.88,attractive to jump into right now.
196,00:13:52.83,00:13:52.83,That tub right there. >> I am so happy right now.
197,00:13:58.04,00:13:58.04,>> I tried my best to be as far away from Jean-Robert in the
198,00:14:02.46,00:14:02.46,bathtub as could possibly happen in that place.
199,00:14:06.00,00:14:06.00,"He had the one on the far end, I took the one on the other far"
200,00:14:08.46,00:14:08.46,end. He's kind of gross.
201,00:14:10.50,00:14:10.50,Every single part of me wants to see Jean-Robert go.
202,00:14:13.08,00:14:13.08,I just don't like him. He's a horrible person.
203,00:14:21.08,00:14:21.08,">> Oh, there we go! We've got some butt action"
204,00:14:23.58,00:14:23.58,happening! >> Whoo!
205,00:14:26.12,00:14:26.12,">> Yeah! >> Yeah, James!"
206,00:14:28.17,00:14:28.17,">> Don't tease me, James! Don't tease me!"
207,00:14:32.88,00:14:32.88,">> James has such a nice butt. He was in the shower, lathering"
208,00:14:37.54,00:14:37.54,"up. He's stripping down, and none of"
209,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,us cared. He has a nice butt.
210,00:14:42.25,00:14:42.25,"I mean, he might as well show it off."
211,00:14:44.46,00:14:44.46,>> Why y'all messing with me? >> I'll speak for myself.
212,00:15:03.88,00:15:03.88,I'm tired of losing. >> We're so into keeping Sherea
213,00:15:31.67,00:15:31.67,"Frosti, Erik, Peih-Gee and I together."
214,00:15:34.50,00:15:34.50,We thought we would do anything to save them-- we'd throw a
215,00:15:37.17,00:15:37.17,"challenge to save them. We did it, you know?"
216,00:15:40.38,00:15:40.38,But Frosti won't make eye contact with us.
217,00:15:42.38,00:15:42.38,We don't know if he's changed his mind and switched over with
218,00:15:44.54,00:15:44.54,"them. You know, everything's just"
219,00:15:47.17,00:15:47.17,"unknown, so it's really hard to deal with, especially when"
220,00:15:49.04,00:15:49.04,there's just three of us here and there's so many over there.
221,00:15:52.00,00:15:52.00,">> Now I'm not sure about Frosti and Sherea, because that flips"
222,00:15:54.25,00:15:54.25,"everything. >> I mean, we have three right"
223,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,"here, three strong. That's great."
224,00:16:03.25,00:16:03.25,>> But it's not enough. >> This the best reward yet.
225,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,>> It's so nice to clean my feet.
226,00:16:18.04,00:16:18.04,"This is the life. >> You know, sometimes"
227,00:16:24.62,00:16:24.62,"throughout this game, I feel like I am the only one playing."
228,00:16:28.46,00:16:28.46,So I knew right away when we kidnapped James that I would
229,00:16:31.96,00:16:31.96,"approach him. >> ""In this sealed tube is a"
230,00:16:58.21,00:16:58.21,clue to the hidden immunity idol.
231,00:17:00.58,00:17:00.58,You must give this to a member of this tribe before you rejoin
232,00:17:03.08,00:17:03.08,"your own."" Cool."
233,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,I hope it's worth it. I need something to save me.
234,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,I'm in a bad spot right now. Todd is the cornerstone to all
235,00:17:13.50,00:17:13.50,"the alliances on this tribe, so I'm going to roll with Todd and"
236,00:17:16.62,00:17:16.62,roll the old dice and maybe it will come up right.
237,00:17:19.67,00:17:19.67,"If not, I'm pretty much gone anyway, so I have to do it."
238,00:17:48.92,00:17:48.92,">> ""There are four that surround it, and four much the same."
239,00:17:51.62,00:17:51.62,"The one etched finer could salvage the game."""
240,00:17:54.38,00:17:54.38,I know what they're talking about.
241,00:17:57.75,00:17:57.75,It's those stupid bats above the freakin' thing.
242,00:18:18.42,00:18:18.42,">> I went over where we thought the idol would be, and I was"
243,00:18:20.75,00:18:20.75,just hitting off shingles so people didn't know what I was
244,00:18:23.17,00:18:23.17,doing. And then Todd comes over...
245,00:18:25.46,00:18:25.46,">> Knock those down. >> He gets up there, and he"
246,00:18:33.33,00:18:33.33,"starts pulling on the thing. >> All of a sudden, Frosti comes"
247,00:18:47.75,00:18:47.75,"running over and climbs up, so I go into panic mode of, ""He's"
248,00:18:50.17,00:18:50.17,"going to find out. He's going to see this!"""
249,00:18:52.25,00:18:52.25,"And Amanda's like, ""Get down, Frosti, get down, Frosti,"""
250,00:18:54.17,00:18:54.17,"because she knows about it. And I'm telling him to get down,"
251,00:19:02.54,00:19:02.54,"and I started panicking, and... Hey, hey, hey!"
252,00:19:15.00,00:19:15.00,"Wait, wait, wait! >> What?"
253,00:19:18.29,00:19:18.29,">> All I could think was Frosti, Frosti, no!"
254,00:19:34.08,00:19:34.08,>> This has to be the worst way in history of getting an
255,00:19:37.75,00:19:37.75,"immunity idol. Like, honestly, in front of"
256,00:19:40.79,00:19:40.79,"everybody, Todd's yelling. He's so impatient."
257,00:19:43.88,00:19:43.88,I knew something like that was going to happen.
258,00:20:02.42,00:20:02.42,>> Being there when they got the idol cements my place in their
259,00:20:04.79,00:20:04.79,little group. I'm there for sure.
260,00:20:07.25,00:20:07.25,Frosti's in. In!
261,00:20:18.17,00:20:18.17,">> James came down. I gave him the idol, and I told"
262,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,him what needs to happen. This is it.
263,00:20:22.92,00:20:22.92,>> Yeah. >> You've just got to lose the
264,00:20:24.54,00:20:24.54,"game. >> So if James takes that idol,"
265,00:20:29.54,00:20:29.54,"loses immunity, they vote for him, but he uses the idol to get"
266,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,"rid of Jaime, we sever the tie between her and Erik."
267,00:20:37.54,00:20:37.54,"Hopefully, at ten we'll merge, and we'll still have our numbers"
268,00:20:40.21,00:20:40.21,"to go strong into the merge. Now, here's the way it works."
269,00:20:43.79,00:20:43.79,"Everybody votes. You stand up and say, ""Jeff, I"
270,00:20:47.00,00:20:47.00,"have the hidden immunity idol."" All of your votes are immune."
271,00:20:50.08,00:20:50.08,The person you vote for is gone. >> Cool.
272,00:20:52.96,00:20:52.96,>> You can make that Jaime. >> I cannot stop smiling.
273,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,"And it's all good, because I'm not going anywhere."
274,00:20:58.46,00:20:58.46,"I have the immunity idol. It's all good, baby."
275,00:21:01.83,00:21:01.83,">> I don't know if the clues are the same as theirs, but they"
276,00:21:04.00,00:21:04.00,"might be. The second you get to camp,"
277,00:21:07.25,00:21:07.25,"their camp, you run up and you grab it off."
278,00:21:10.46,00:21:10.46,>> Cool. I was going to do that anyway.
279,00:21:12.38,00:21:12.38,>> But do it without them noticing.
280,00:21:14.33,00:21:14.33,>> I'm the only one with real access to the other immunity
281,00:21:17.12,00:21:17.12,idol at the other tribe. So now all I have to do is stay
282,00:21:19.75,00:21:19.75,"focused, keep my head in the game, lose the immunity"
283,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,"challenge, get the other idol. Now I have both of them."
284,00:21:24.67,00:21:24.67,"I mean, it's going to be wonderful."
285,00:21:26.71,00:21:26.71,I'm having a great time. >> This saved our asses.
286,00:21:44.92,00:21:44.92,">> Jaime, all right. >> Do you know how?"
287,00:21:47.00,00:21:47.00,I found the hidden immunity idol.
288,00:21:48.92,00:21:48.92,>> You found it? >> I gave it to James for them
289,00:21:51.21,00:21:51.21,to lose and get rid of Jaime. So we still have our numbers.
290,00:21:54.79,00:21:54.79,>> How did you find it? >> See that empty square up
291,00:21:56.88,00:21:56.88,"there? >> No way, just right there in"
292,00:21:58.38,00:21:58.38,front of everybody. >> Yeah.
293,00:22:02.04,00:22:02.04,>> Okay. >> James knows to throw the
294,00:22:04.25,00:22:04.25,challenge. >> I can't believe it.
295,00:22:06.21,00:22:06.21,Here it was sitting right in front of us at camp the whole
296,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,"darn time. >> So I will be doing my best,"
297,00:22:10.29,00:22:10.29,"as I always give 110%, because that's the only way I know how"
298,00:22:13.12,00:22:13.12,to go. >> Me telling Courtney and
299,00:22:20.29,00:22:20.29,Denise about the hidden immunity idol helped them realize that
300,00:22:23.04,00:22:23.04,"they had to try harder for immunity today, especially if"
301,00:22:26.08,00:22:26.08,"they're fighting to lose, which we don't even know is the case."
302,00:22:29.46,00:22:29.46,">> Over at Zhan Hu, I'm pretty much a dead man walking."
303,00:22:33.83,00:22:33.83,But now I have the upper hand. They think they're safe-- wrong.
304,00:22:37.83,00:22:37.83,"I'll be able to get them. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys!"
305,00:22:59.04,00:22:59.04,"So James, time to head back to your tribe, Zhan Hu."
306,00:23:02.17,00:23:02.17,">> JEFF: All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity"
307,00:23:07.04,00:23:07.04,"challenge? First things first, Todd."
308,00:23:10.79,00:23:10.79,"Take back immunity. Once again, immunity back up for"
309,00:23:16.29,00:23:16.29,grabs. Today's challenge will be a
310,00:23:19.12,00:23:19.12,food-eating competition. You're going to eat traditional
311,00:23:23.88,00:23:23.88,Chinese dishes that are anything but pleasant.
312,00:23:29.71,00:23:29.71,">> Oh, my god. >> Oh, gross."
313,00:23:31.54,00:23:31.54,">> One at a time, players from each tribe will step up and"
314,00:23:33.50,00:23:33.50,square off. The first person to get their
315,00:23:35.62,00:23:35.62,food down scores a point for their tribe.
316,00:23:37.54,00:23:37.54,"The first tribe to four wins immunity, safe in this game."
317,00:23:40.67,00:23:40.67,"Make sense? >> Oh, yeah."
318,00:23:43.12,00:23:43.12,">> JEFF: Fei Long, you have three extra members."
319,00:23:45.08,00:23:45.08,You're sitting three people out. You cannot sit the same people
320,00:23:46.96,00:23:46.96,"out in back-to-back challenges. Courtney, Amanda, and Denise sat"
321,00:23:50.29,00:23:50.29,out in the last challenge. You are playing in this
322,00:23:53.08,00:23:53.08,challenge. You need one more member to join
323,00:23:54.92,00:23:54.92,them. >> That's going to be Frosti.
324,00:23:56.58,00:23:56.58,>> JEFF: Frosti. Everybody else take a spot on
325,00:23:59.17,00:23:59.17,the bench. We'll get started.
326,00:24:02.12,00:24:02.12,First two come up. Frosti taking on Peih-Gee.
327,00:24:06.17,00:24:06.17,">> Come on, Frosti. You own this."
328,00:24:09.58,00:24:09.58,">> JEFF: Chinese name for this, ghi ching."
329,00:24:12.21,00:24:12.21,You know what that is? >> No.
330,00:24:14.62,00:24:14.62,">> JEFF: Chicken hearts. >> Oh, yeah."
331,00:24:17.83,00:24:17.83,"You own this! >> Oh, my god."
332,00:24:20.17,00:24:20.17,>> JEFF: Ten each. Got to get all ten down.
333,00:24:24.92,00:24:24.92,Survivors ready? Go.
334,00:24:29.12,00:24:29.12,Peih-Gee shoving them down. Frosti shoving them down.
335,00:24:32.58,00:24:32.58,">> Swallow them, Peih-Gee. >> Oh, Frosti, don't enjoy them,"
336,00:24:37.92,00:24:37.92,"swallow them. >> Swallow, Peih-Gee, swallow."
337,00:24:40.29,00:24:40.29,">> That's it, Frosti, good job. >> JEFF: Frosti making quick"
338,00:24:43.29,00:24:43.29,work of the chicken hearts. He's got to get them down now.
339,00:24:46.04,00:24:46.04,">> Oh, that's beautiful. >> JEFF: He's licking the plate."
340,00:24:50.12,00:24:50.12,">> Yeah, baby! >> What?"
341,00:24:52.12,00:24:52.12,>> JEFF: For emphasis. Fei Long scores.
342,00:24:54.79,00:24:54.79,"Fei Long leads, one-zip. Next two, Jaime and Courtney."
343,00:25:04.29,00:25:04.29,Nizho is the Chinese name for this.
344,00:25:07.08,00:25:07.08,"You guys got off easy-- eel. >> Oh, cool."
345,00:25:11.04,00:25:11.04,">> JEFF: Three pieces of eel Got to get all of it down,"
346,00:25:13.29,00:25:13.29,including the heads. Fei Long leads one-zip for

348,00:25:17.38,00:25:17.38,"Go. >> Come on, Jaime."
349,00:25:20.25,00:25:20.25,">> Good job, Courtney. >> JEFF: Courtney and Jaime both"
350,00:25:22.12,00:25:22.12,attacking the eel. Probably the best food you've
351,00:25:24.54,00:25:24.54,had in 18 days. Jaime not messing around.
352,00:25:28.21,00:25:28.21,She's already on her second piece of eel.
353,00:25:31.75,00:25:31.75,Courtney still working on the first.
354,00:25:33.79,00:25:33.79,Jaime working on her third piece of eel.
355,00:25:35.83,00:25:35.83,">> Come on, Courtney. >> JEFF: Jaime finishing up her"
356,00:25:38.75,00:25:38.75,third piece of eel. Courtney catching up.
357,00:25:41.54,00:25:41.54,Courtney now done with her second piece of eel.
358,00:25:45.04,00:25:45.04,">> There's the puking, there's the gagging."
359,00:25:47.17,00:25:47.17,There it comes. Here it comes.
360,00:25:48.71,00:25:48.71,">> Go, Courtney. >> Go, Courtney."
361,00:25:50.58,00:25:50.58,"Swallow it, swallow it, Courtney."
362,00:25:52.21,00:25:52.21,Keep going. >> JEFF: Jamie on her last bit.
363,00:25:54.25,00:25:54.25,Courtney trying to shove the last of her eel down.
364,00:25:56.62,00:25:56.62,Jaime has it. Zhan Hu scores.
365,00:26:00.58,00:26:00.58,"We're tied one-one. Next two, come up."
366,00:26:06.25,00:26:06.25,">> Do this, Amanda. >> All right, Erik, you're"
367,00:26:09.00,00:26:09.00,hungry. >> JEFF: Jhing zeng wei is the
368,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,name of this dish. Baby turtles.

370,00:26:18.04,00:26:18.04,everything? >> JEFF: Three each.
371,00:26:21.62,00:26:21.62,We're tied one-one for immunity. Survivors ready?
372,00:26:27.12,00:26:27.12,Go. Amanda throws the first two in
373,00:26:31.92,00:26:31.92,her mouth. Erik working one at a time.
374,00:26:35.21,00:26:35.21,">> Wow, Amanda! You're a champion, Amanda!"
375,00:26:38.17,00:26:38.17,">> Swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow."

380,00:26:47.96,00:26:47.96,Swallow it! >> JEFF: Erik has it.
381,00:26:53.00,00:26:53.00,Zhan Hu leads two-one. Playing to four.
382,00:26:56.62,00:26:56.62,Next two. Denise and James.
383,00:27:01.50,00:27:01.50,"Chinese name for this, mau dje don."
384,00:27:07.08,00:27:07.08,Balut is the name we call it. These are chicken fetuses.
385,00:27:12.83,00:27:12.83,">> Come on, Denise. You can do this."
386,00:27:16.00,00:27:16.00,>> JEFF: You each have two. They've been weighed.
387,00:27:18.42,00:27:18.42,It is equal portions. They still have the feathers on
388,00:27:21.38,00:27:21.38,"them, so be careful of that when they go down."
389,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,Zhan Hu leads two-one. Playing to four.
390,00:27:27.92,00:27:27.92,Survivors ready? Go.
391,00:27:33.08,00:27:33.08,>> Ah! >> JEFF: James spitting it back
392,00:27:35.42,00:27:35.42,"up. >> Come on, James."
393,00:27:37.38,00:27:37.38,"It's a cheeseburger. Oh, it's a sandwich."
394,00:27:39.17,00:27:39.17,>> Get in my mouth! Ah!
395,00:27:41.12,00:27:41.12,Get in there. Aaggh!
396,00:27:43.25,00:27:43.25,>> JEFF: Denise takes a big chunk of feathers.
397,00:27:45.67,00:27:45.67,"James struggling. >> James, you're going to let"
398,00:27:48.04,00:27:48.04,Denise show you up? >> JEFF: James spitting it back
399,00:27:50.79,00:27:50.79,up into his bowl. >> Over in two seconds.
400,00:27:53.67,00:27:53.67,">> Just swallow it, Denise. You got this, own it!"
401,00:27:56.38,00:27:56.38,">> JEFF: Denise, you're struggling."
402,00:28:00.12,00:28:00.12,"Mind over matter. >> That's the way, Denise."
403,00:28:04.58,00:28:04.58,"Denise puts it down, and it comes right back up."
404,00:28:07.79,00:28:07.79,">> Oh, Denise, you've got him. >> Denise, you've got him."
405,00:28:10.62,00:28:10.62,"He's gagging on it, Denise. >> Oh, yeah, he's full from"
406,00:28:13.00,00:28:13.00,"breakfast. >> Are you giving up, James?"
407,00:28:15.17,00:28:15.17,Give me a break. You going to let Denise beat
408,00:28:17.25,00:28:17.25,you.? >> You've got this James.
409,00:28:22.58,00:28:22.58,">> Put it in your mouth, hold your nose, chew and swallow."
410,00:28:27.21,00:28:27.21,">> Yeah, hold your nose, James. >> Sorry, James."
411,00:28:29.25,00:28:29.25,">> JEFF: Denise, you giving up? >> No way Denise is giving up."
412,00:28:33.08,00:28:33.08,">> Denise, come on. >> I got it."
413,00:28:47.12,00:28:47.12,">> Oh, god. >> Chew it."
414,00:28:50.67,00:28:50.67,>> JEFF: James puts it all in his mouth.
415,00:28:54.46,00:28:54.46,">> Come on, man. >> JEFF: James scores for Zhan"
416,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,Hu. Zhan Hu leads 3-1.
417,00:29:03.67,00:29:03.67,>> You are the man! Give him some water.
418,00:29:05.62,00:29:05.62,"Good job, Denise. >> JEFF: Next two, come up."
419,00:29:08.25,00:29:08.25,Frosti coming up for Fei Long. Erik coming back for Zhan Hu.
420,00:29:12.33,00:29:12.33,Everybody's gone once. We're on the second round.
421,00:29:15.88,00:29:15.88,Pei dhong is the name. Thousand-year-old egg.
422,00:29:21.21,00:29:21.21,"Put a little clay around them, some ash to keep them preserved."
423,00:29:23.96,00:29:23.96,I promise you this will not be the best thing you've ever
424,00:29:26.04,00:29:26.04,"eaten, and it will rival anything you've tried before."
425,00:29:30.12,00:29:30.12,>> Yes. >> JEFF: Here's where we stand.
426,00:29:32.42,00:29:32.42,"Zhan Hu leads three-one. Frosti, if you do not win this"
427,00:29:35.62,00:29:35.62,"point, Zhan Hu wins immunity. Eric, win this point, you win"
428,00:29:39.12,00:29:39.12,immunity for Zhan Hu. Survivors ready.
429,00:29:42.17,00:29:42.17,Go. Frosti is not messing around at
430,00:29:47.96,00:29:47.96,all. Get it all in there.
431,00:29:51.00,00:29:51.00,">> Come on, Frost. Erik's got it for Zhan Hu."
432,00:29:57.08,00:29:57.08,"Zhan Hu wins immunity. >> Good job, Frost."
433,00:30:08.71,00:30:08.71,"Zhan Hu, congratulations. No tribal council tonight,"
434,00:30:13.62,00:30:13.62,nobody going home. >> Yes!
435,00:30:16.75,00:30:16.75,">> Finally. >> JEFF: Fei Long, tribal"
436,00:30:19.33,00:30:19.33,council tonight where one of the seven of you will be going home.
437,00:30:23.08,00:30:23.08,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
438,00:30:25.12,00:30:25.12,"I'll see you at tribal. >> See you, guys."
439,00:30:47.50,00:30:47.50,">> Heads up high, guys, because we played well."
440,00:30:50.29,00:30:50.29,"Denise, you got brutalized. That was, like... obviously,"
441,00:30:53.12,00:30:53.12,"that was the toughest one. >> I just feel bad, though, you"
442,00:30:55.42,00:30:55.42,know. I'm sorry.
443,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,I let my teammates down today. James tried to eat that balut as
444,00:31:01.75,00:31:01.75,slow as he possibly could so that I could keep up with him.
445,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,"But unfortunately, I just could not get that down my throat, so"
446,00:31:08.33,00:31:08.33,"we ended up on the losing end. >> Perfect plan, genius idea,"
447,00:31:17.04,00:31:17.04,smashed. And so we're trying to look on
448,00:31:20.00,00:31:20.00,"the positive side and say, ""Hey, we lost."""
449,00:31:22.17,00:31:22.17,"We still get rid of one of the old Zhan Hu, and we still have"
450,00:31:25.17,00:31:25.17,our numbers. Courtney's on our side for sure.
451,00:31:39.25,00:31:39.25,"I'm positive, almost positive James is on our side."
452,00:31:42.50,00:31:42.50,>> Yeah. >> Because he did try to throw
453,00:31:44.08,00:31:44.08,that. And I don't think he has
454,00:31:45.79,00:31:45.79,anything going on with the new guys.
455,00:31:47.25,00:31:47.25,">> No, I don't think so. I think he's... seriously, I"
456,00:31:48.88,00:31:48.88,think he's with us. >> He's with us.
457,00:31:50.42,00:31:50.42,>> I really do think he's with us.
458,00:31:52.12,00:31:52.12,>> We've got five right there. And I'm almost 100% positive
459,00:31:54.00,00:31:54.00,that Frosti will stay. Right now we need him to trust
460,00:31:58.25,00:31:58.25,us and this tonight will help him trust us.
461,00:32:00.17,00:32:00.17,Does that make sense? Because we want to trust him
462,00:32:03.12,00:32:03.12,just as much as he wants to trust us.
463,00:32:06.25,00:32:06.25,">> I'm also coming to get water. >> Oh, good."
464,00:32:08.46,00:32:08.46,So Sherea is gone tonight. >> Right.
465,00:32:15.00,00:32:15.00,">> All right, so we're in agreement for Sherea tonight,"
466,00:32:16.58,00:32:16.58,huh? >> Yeah.
467,00:32:18.38,00:32:18.38,">> So after Todd's and Amanda's plans went awry, they're like,"
468,00:32:21.54,00:32:21.54,"""Okay, well, no question about it, we're voting off Sherea,"
469,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,"okay?"" Sherea, Sherea, Sherea."
470,00:32:25.12,00:32:25.12,"And I'm like, ""Yeah, okay, whatever."""
471,00:32:27.54,00:32:27.54,"But when I thought about for a little while, I actually like"
472,00:32:30.71,00:32:30.71,Sharea. And if it came down to it of who
473,00:32:33.75,00:32:33.75,"I thought would vote me out quicker, I definitely think that"
474,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,she would keep me around longer than Jean-Robert.
475,00:33:19.38,00:33:19.38,">> Well, right now, the people at Fei Long want me to go home."
476,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,What they don't understand is they need to be scared of the
477,00:33:24.62,00:33:24.62,"people in their tribe, too. You know, as far as Jean-Robert,"
478,00:33:27.12,00:33:27.12,he'll vote any of them out. So the same time they're looking
479,00:33:30.88,00:33:30.88,"at me, they need to be scared of each other."
480,00:33:34.62,00:33:34.62,"Mm-hmm. >> You know, everybody's name"
481,00:33:44.00,00:33:44.00,"gets on the list eventually. I mean, I hate doing it, I"
482,00:33:47.25,00:33:47.25,"really do, because I like her a lot."
483,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,"I hate it. >> I do, too."
484,00:33:51.17,00:33:51.17,">> Obviously, I'd rather it be her than me, and I think it's a"
485,00:33:55.17,00:33:55.17,smarter move. >> Do you know what I mean?
486,00:34:06.38,00:34:06.38,>> It's the smarter idea right now to stick with more of our
487,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,"tribe. And honestly, it has to be"
488,00:34:11.12,00:34:11.12,Frosti or Sharea. >> Do you know what I mean?
489,00:34:19.29,00:34:19.29,">> No, I totally understand. >> Eventually, it will be down"
490,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33,"to like, our people, you know? But right now, it's not."
491,00:34:25.50,00:34:25.50,And we have to look at the bigger picture of things.
492,00:34:28.42,00:34:28.42,">> The thing is, it's like, our great plan didn't work today"
493,00:34:31.58,00:34:31.58,either. Do you know what I mean?
494,00:34:39.12,00:34:39.12,">> There's only so much planning we can do at, like, every stage."
495,00:34:42.54,00:34:42.54,"Like, you can't predict what's going to happen."
496,00:34:57.33,00:34:57.33,">> I like to trust my gut and my vibe, and so far, I've really"
497,00:35:01.62,00:35:01.62,felt comfortable about my position in the game.
498,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,"All of a sudden, something doesn't feel 100% to me."
499,00:35:10.46,00:35:10.46,"The plan was either Sherea or Frosti, most likely Sherea."
500,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,"But I've got to tell you, I'm uneasy right now."
501,00:35:24.33,00:35:24.33,>> I feel like we should vote out Jean-Robert tonight.
502,00:35:26.08,00:35:26.08,Do you know what's happening now?
503,00:35:28.00,00:35:28.00,We are lining ourselves up as power players.
504,00:35:30.79,00:35:30.79,They will get rid of us if we don't start doing what people
505,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,want. Because Jean-Robert is not
506,00:35:37.08,00:35:37.08,"stupid, and he will turn on us. He will."
507,00:35:41.79,00:35:41.79,">> Sharea will too. Todd, I don't know."
508,00:35:46.88,00:35:46.88,I think Jean-Robert definitely has to go.
509,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"I don't think now is the time, honestly."
510,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,">> I don't know what to do. >> Honestly, my gut feeling is"
511,00:35:55.54,00:35:55.54,that... >> My gut's saying Jean-Robert.
512,00:36:01.92,00:36:01.92,>> So I guess it comes down to who we feel we can trust more at
513,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,this point-- Jean-Robert or Sherea.
514,00:36:08.67,00:36:08.67,">> I... this sucks. >> JEFF: Well, when you're"
515,00:36:39.96,00:36:39.96,"winning, it's easy to get along. You start to lose, things"
516,00:36:42.04,00:36:42.04,"change. Sherea, what did you sense when"
517,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,you guys got back today after losing?
518,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,>> I sense a lot of shadiness today.
519,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,"You know, people talking like, ""Let's talk here."
520,00:36:51.79,00:36:51.79,"Okay, now let's talk. Let me go talk."
521,00:36:53.38,00:36:53.38,"I'll be back."" That's how it's running over"
522,00:36:55.08,00:36:55.08,"here, you know? >> JEFF: Jean-Robert, does the"
523,00:36:57.71,00:36:57.71,"game continue to change day to day, and does that then affect"
524,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,the way you play it? >> I'll tell you what-- it's day
525,00:37:05.33,00:37:05.33,"18, Jeff, and I'm a changed person."
526,00:37:07.88,00:37:07.88,"I mean, I find myself doing a little cooking, a little fire."
527,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,And it's routine now. It's not even chores.
528,00:37:12.96,00:37:12.96,>> Did you ask him all that? Wow.
529,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,Somebody along the way told him that he had something important
530,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,"to say, because he does a lot of talking, always running his"
531,00:37:20.33,00:37:20.33,"mouth, story after story. >> What do you say to that?"
532,00:37:25.46,00:37:25.46,>> You don't say anything. That's why you don't say
533,00:37:27.46,00:37:27.46,"anything to me, because you know you don't want me to say"
534,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,anything back to you. You talk to the people who
535,00:37:31.04,00:37:31.04,aren't going to say anything to you.
536,00:37:32.92,00:37:32.92,"Little do you know, they don't like you."
537,00:37:35.71,00:37:35.71,">> JEFF: Would that surprise you, Jean-Robert, if you found"
538,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,out that the people on the tribe didn't like you?
539,00:37:41.54,00:37:41.54,>> I'm certain that some of the people do not like me.
540,00:37:43.54,00:37:43.54,I'm a bad boy. Sometimes that happens.
541,00:37:45.04,00:37:45.04,"But, you know, even as a bad boy, and being aggressive, I"
542,00:37:48.58,00:37:48.58,"like the way I'm playing this game, and I think I'm doing just"
543,00:37:50.42,00:37:50.42,"fine. >> JEFF: Courtney, the look on"
544,00:37:52.92,00:37:52.92,"your face, very smug. >> Bad boy?"
545,00:37:56.00,00:37:56.00,Not quite the term I would have perhaps selected.
546,00:37:59.50,00:37:59.50,But it's always interesting to hear people talk about
547,00:38:02.92,00:38:02.92,"themselves and, really, ""Bad boy, bad boy,"" because you play"
548,00:38:06.83,00:38:06.83,poker or something? Do you have a Harley I don't
549,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,know about? >> JEFF: Would a Harley make
550,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,"Jean-Robert a bad boy? >> Well, I mean, bad boy... who"
551,00:38:14.21,00:38:14.21,"do you think you are, Luke Perry?"
552,00:38:16.08,00:38:16.08,">> JEFF: How would you describe Jean-Robert, Courtney?"
553,00:38:19.79,00:38:19.79,">> I mean, we don't get along. We don't like each other."
554,00:38:23.04,00:38:23.04,"I think he walks around, he talks a lot, jokes that aren't"
555,00:38:25.12,00:38:25.12,"funny, lot of judgments of other people, a lot of self-"
556,00:38:27.79,00:38:27.79,"righteousness. You know, I think, like, that"
557,00:38:30.42,00:38:30.42,"kind of stuff is, like... he's just a crappy person."
558,00:38:34.08,00:38:34.08,"And, yeah, I'm going to laugh at him when he's like, ""I'm a bad"
559,00:38:36.58,00:38:36.58,"boy, but, you know, I go out and get some fish."""
560,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,"Like, it's just funny, just as an observer and to being like"
561,00:38:42.75,00:38:42.75,sort of the outsider of my tribe.
562,00:38:45.62,00:38:45.62,"Like, I know we have two members of another tribe that have"
563,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"joined us, but I think I was on the outs before they got here."
564,00:38:51.88,00:38:51.88,">> See, that kinds of hurts, though, because I love you, and"
565,00:38:53.96,00:38:53.96,"I've love you since day three, is what I say, because day one"
566,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,and two I didn't really like you.
567,00:38:58.25,00:38:58.25,">> But... >> I love you, and we get along"
568,00:39:00.17,00:39:00.17,"so well. >> I love you guys, too, but"
569,00:39:01.92,00:39:01.92,"it's also... you know, it's a really cliquey tribe."
570,00:39:04.25,00:39:04.25,>> And I click well with you is how I felt.
571,00:39:06.58,00:39:06.58,"And so, like, for you to say that you're on the outskirts and"
572,00:39:08.79,00:39:08.79,"that you're not close to me is a little bit of, like, rubbing"
573,00:39:11.50,00:39:11.50,salt in the wounds. >> But...
574,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,">> I guess that's just how it is, though."
575,00:39:17.25,00:39:17.25,">> I got to tell you, Jeff, even with this infighting going on,"
576,00:39:21.71,00:39:21.71,"and this is a place to air out dirty laundry, when it comes to"
577,00:39:24.12,00:39:24.12,"the challenges and coming together, I think we really do"
578,00:39:27.92,00:39:27.92,"work well together as a team. And to be honest with you, we're"
579,00:39:29.58,00:39:29.58,in a good spot. I like where we're at.
580,00:39:31.50,00:39:31.50,">> JEFF: On that note, it is time to vote."
581,00:39:33.67,00:39:33.67,"Denise, you're up. >> It's unfortunate we didn't"
582,00:39:50.17,00:39:50.17,get a chance to know each other a little better.
583,00:40:04.17,00:40:04.17,>> Somebody along the way told you you were hot.
584,00:40:06.12,00:40:06.12,I'm going to bust that big bubble you call a mouth and tell
585,00:40:08.04,00:40:08.04,you you're not. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the
586,00:40:25.12,00:40:25.12,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
587,00:40:36.21,00:40:36.21,decision is final. The person voted out will be
588,00:40:38.04,00:40:38.04,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
589,00:40:40.00,00:40:40.00,"I'll read the votes. First vote, J.R, Jean-Robert."
590,00:40:49.75,00:40:49.75,Jean-Robert. Two votes Jean-Robert.
591,00:40:55.67,00:40:55.67,"Sherea. Two votes Jean-Robert, one vote"
592,00:40:57.62,00:40:57.62,Sherea. Sherea.
593,00:41:02.21,00:41:02.21,"Two votes Jean-Robert, two votes Sherea."
594,00:41:07.62,00:41:07.62,"Sherea. That's three votes Sherea, two"
595,00:41:09.83,00:41:09.83,votes Jean-Robert. Sixth person voted out of
596,00:41:15.08,00:41:15.08,"Survivor: China, Sherea. That's four."
597,00:41:17.54,00:41:17.54,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
598,00:41:29.29,00:41:29.29,"Sherea, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
599,00:41:46.04,00:41:46.04,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."

604,00:42:08.67,00:42:08.67,from our next episode. >> JEFF: Next time on Survivor:
605,00:42:14.54,00:42:14.54,Jamie and Erik make a discovery. >> It looks idol-ish.
606,00:42:20.04,00:42:20.04,>> I want to be friends with you!
607,00:42:23.04,00:42:23.04,>> JEFF: Todd struggles to held his alliance together.
608,00:42:25.29,00:42:25.29,>> I don't feel like you're my friends.
609,00:42:27.25,00:42:27.25,">> If I get screwed, I'm going to hold you responsible."

611,00:42:37.83,00:42:37.83,>> The fact that the Fei Long people decided to stick together
612,00:42:41.46,00:42:41.46,"because of numbers, you know, it just says that they're getting"
613,00:42:44.38,00:42:44.38,played. They'll realize it sooner or
614,00:42:47.62,00:42:47.62,"later, and I hope half of them get screwed, since some of them"
615,00:42:50.21,00:42:50.21,"screwed me. But, you know, they knew they"
616,00:42:52.21,00:42:52.21,couldn't beat me in the challenges.
617,00:42:53.62,00:42:53.62,"I was the strong one, they were the weak ones."
618,00:42:55.12,00:42:55.12,So of course they're going to take out the threat.
