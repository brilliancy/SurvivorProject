189,00:12:57.57,00:12:57.57,ME AND DENISE HAVE BEEN SUPER TIGHT SINCE THE BEGINNING.
190,00:13:00.23,00:13:00.23,>> OKAY. >> AND YOU'RE MY NEW MOMMA AND
191,00:13:03.60,00:13:03.60,NOOSE JUST HOW IT'S GOING TO BE. IT'S THE THREE OF US TO THE END.
192,00:13:06.27,00:13:06.27,NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. >> OKAY.

194,00:13:11.33,00:13:11.33,"HOPEFULLY HAS A HEART. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, NOW I'M"
195,00:13:14.40,00:13:14.40,LOCKED INTO THIS INVOLUNTARY ALLIANCE WITH LISA AND
196,00:13:17.97,00:13:17.97,DENEETION. IT'S LITERALLY THE TWO PEOPLE
197,00:13:19.20,00:13:19.20,I'M NOT CONFIDENT I CAN BEAT IN THE FINAL THREE.
198,00:13:21.20,00:13:21.20,"JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NICE, BUT THE WHOLE DYNAMICS COULD SHIFT,"
199,00:13:24.73,00:13:24.73,AND THE ENTIRE CAMP IS GOING CRAZY WITH SCRAMBLING.
200,00:13:28.43,00:13:28.43,>> I'M SORRY. >> YOU GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK.
201,00:13:31.03,00:13:31.03,">> MALCOLM PROMISED FINAL THREE WITH ME AND DENISE, AND THAT'S"
202,00:13:35.10,00:13:35.10,REALLY NICE. BUT YOU KIND OF HAVE TO TAKE ALL
203,00:13:38.63,00:13:38.63,THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. I'M NOT THE ONLY ACTOR ON THIS
204,00:13:43.20,00:13:43.20,ISLAND. SO I COULD BE BEING PLAYED.
205,00:14:08.33,00:14:08.33,">> OH, THAT'S AMAZING. >> I HAVEN'T HAD TO DEAL WITH"
206,00:14:14.93,00:14:14.93,IT. >> THEY'RE TOO YOUNG.
207,00:14:15.67,00:14:15.67,>> I KNOW. I'M SHOCKED.
208,00:14:18.90,00:14:18.90,">> YOU KNOW, THIS IS JUST SO MUCH FUN TO JUST GET TO BE ME."
209,00:14:23.00,00:14:23.00,>> YEAH. >> SO PENNER IS AWARE OF MY PAST
210,00:14:26.60,00:14:26.60,AS A CHILD STAR. BUT WE DIDN'T TALK STRATEGY.
211,00:14:31.00,00:14:31.00,"AND IF WE WEREN'T ON THIS ISLAND, WE WOULD HAVE A REALLY"

213,00:14:37.63,00:14:37.63,LIVES. AND IF YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF
214,00:14:40.07,00:14:40.07,"CONNECTION, THAT IS VALUABLE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO END UP"
215,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,"ALIGNED LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD. >> YOU JUST NEVER, EVER REALLY"
216,00:14:48.70,00:14:48.70,KNOW IF SOMEBODY LIKES YOU FOR YOU AND TO HAVE THESE
217,00:14:51.43,00:14:51.43,FRIENDSHIPS ALREADY THAT REALLY ARE TOTALLY BASED ON LIKING ME
218,00:14:55.30,00:14:55.30,FOR ME. IS VERY HEALING IN A REALLY DEEP
219,00:14:59.63,00:14:59.63,WAY. >> YEAH.

224,00:15:17.27,00:15:17.27,LISA IS KIND OF A COOL LADY. I THINK SHE COULD ACTUALLY GO
225,00:15:20.67,00:15:20.67,PRETTY FAR AS AN UNDER-THE-RADAR NONTHREATENING PERSON WHO COULD
226,00:15:25.97,00:15:25.97,FIND HERSELF SITTING AT A FINAL THREE.
227,00:15:27.70,00:15:27.70,I BELIEVE THAT. I WON'T BLOW YOUR COVER.
228,00:15:29.77,00:15:29.77,>> THANK YOU. >> THEY'VE GOT THE NUMBERS NOW.
229,00:15:45.63,00:15:45.63,THEY COULD VOTE YOU AND I OUT IF THEY WANT TO.

231,00:15:54.13,00:15:54.13,SURVIVE. >> THE RETURNING PLAYER BULL'S

233,00:15:57.70,00:15:57.70,SMARTEST MOVE? I'M TRYING TO FIND FISSURES IN
234,00:16:03.87,00:16:03.87,THIS YELLOW TRIBE AND SKUPIN SEEMS LIKE A COOL GUY.
235,00:16:06.63,00:16:06.63,SO I GOT TO HELP HIM FEEL AS COMFORTABLE AS HE CAN ABOUT
236,00:16:10.60,00:16:10.60,SLITTING THE THROATS OF THE PEOPLE HE SPENT 17 DAYS WITH.
237,00:16:13.43,00:16:13.43,YOU KNOW. SO I'M TRYING TO DO THAT.
238,00:16:15.40,00:16:15.40,"MY BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL, TOO. >> RIGHT."

240,00:16:20.83,00:16:20.83,IS I GOT FOUR LOYAL PEOPLE. I HAVE A REALLY SERIOUS BLOC.

242,00:16:27.73,00:16:27.73,INCREDIBLE. >> WHAT PERCENT ARE YOU ON

247,00:16:50.20,00:16:50.20,WOULD LIKE TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE SECURE.

251,00:17:07.83,00:17:07.83,OBVIOUS ABOUT ME AND MIKE. THEY OFTSIDES US BOTH FOR 17
252,00:17:11.07,00:17:11.07,DAYS. SO PENNER CORRALLED HIS

254,00:17:18.00,00:17:18.00,SIX. SO WHY WOULDN'T WE DO SOMETHING?

363,00:25:57.07,00:25:57.07,>> HAVING THE NECKLACE ON TONIGHT WOULD BE SWEET.
364,00:25:59.97,00:25:59.97,"AND, YEAH, I JUST WANT TO WIN. >> Jeff: AND JUST LIKE THAT,"
365,00:26:14.10,00:26:14.10,JEFF DROPS OUT. CARTER WINS INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY.
366,00:26:17.47,00:26:17.47,">> GO, CARTER! >> Jeff: CARTER AND DENISE"
367,00:26:20.43,00:26:20.43,BOTH WILL HAVE IMMUNITY AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.
368,00:26:22.60,00:26:22.60,">> JEFF, I KNOW YOU COULD HAVE KEPT GOING."
369,00:26:24.77,00:26:24.77,>> THAT WAS WAR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
370,00:26:27.60,00:26:27.60,">> Jeff: DENISE, COME ON OVER. ( APPLAUSE )"
371,00:26:34.17,00:26:34.17,>> THAT'S THE FIRST TIME SHE'S HAD IMMUNITY.
372,00:26:36.70,00:26:36.70,>> IT MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN HER. >> OH!
373,00:26:39.30,00:26:39.30,">> Jeff: DENISE, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL."
374,00:26:42.30,00:26:42.30,"SLIDE RIGHT OVER HERE. CARTER, COME ON OVER."
375,00:26:46.73,00:26:46.73,"( APPLAUSE ) >> GO, CARTER!"
376,00:26:50.90,00:26:50.90,">> Jeff: CARTER, SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL."
377,00:26:54.30,00:26:54.30,"AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, TONIGHT YOUR SHOT AT THE MILLION DOLLARS"
378,00:26:58.37,00:26:58.37,WILL COME TO AN END. GRAB YOUR STUFF.
379,00:27:01.70,00:27:01.70,HEAD BACK TO CAMP. SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
380,00:27:04.00,00:27:04.00,>> I'M ACSTATIC THAT PEB PENNER AND R.C. DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE
381,00:27:08.20,00:27:08.20,TO WINNING IMMUNITY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE
382,00:27:11.23,00:27:11.23,"BETWEEN PENNER AND R.C., AND IF PENNER PLAYS THE IDOL, R.C. GOES"
383,00:27:14.97,00:27:14.97,"HOME. IF PENNER DOESN'T PLAY THE IDOL,"
384,00:27:16.93,00:27:16.93,HE'LL GO HOME WITH THE IDOL. SO FAR.
385,00:27:50.70,00:27:50.70,"NO, I DIDN'T WIN IMMUNITY, BUT WE SORT OF HAVE THIS VERY COOR"
386,00:27:54.40,00:27:54.40,"SIX IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. ME AND MIKE ARE SOLID, AND WE"
387,00:27:57.43,00:27:57.43,ARE DEFINITELY WITH KALABAW. WITH US SIX WE ARE IN THE
388,00:28:01.67,00:28:01.67,MAJORITY. >> I NEVER HAVE EVER FELT
389,00:28:09.67,00:28:09.67,"THREATENED BEFORE, AND TONIGHT, RETURNING PLAYERS ARE A MAJOR"
390,00:28:15.83,00:28:15.83,"THREAT. LIKE, MY REPUTATION IS PRETTY"
391,00:28:18.47,00:28:18.47,COMPETITIVE. MY REPUTATION ISN'T BEING LOYAL
392,00:28:21.07,00:28:21.07,TO A TRIBE THAT HASN'T BEEN LOYAL TO ME.
393,00:28:23.87,00:28:23.87,THERE ISN'T ANYBODY THAT WOULD THINK THAT I WOULD GO DOWN
394,00:28:25.93,00:28:25.93,WITHOUT A FIGHT. I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WITH THEM.
395,00:28:48.80,00:28:48.80,>> YEAH. BIGGEST HANG-UP I HAVE OF ALL
396,00:28:53.43,00:28:53.43,THIS IS I DON'T WANT TO LET PENNER BEAT ME OUT IN THIS GAME.
397,00:28:58.27,00:28:58.27,"IT'S AND YOU PENNER GET TOGETHER, AND THERE ARE TWO"
398,00:29:03.17,00:29:03.17,VETERAN GUYS. LET'S TAKE IT TO THE END.
399,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,SO WE GET SCREWED. THAT'S THE OWNING THING I WORRY
400,00:29:08.93,00:29:08.93,ABOUT. >> I CAN TELL WITH YOU INTEGRITY
401,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,THAT I WOULD FOLLOW YOU GUYS. IT JUST TAKES TWO PEOPLE FROM
402,00:29:15.77,00:29:15.77,TANDANG TO REALIGN WITH THE KALABAW TRIBE.
403,00:29:19.03,00:29:19.03,THEN THEY WOULD BE SIX STRONG. UNLESS GOD HIMSELF APPEARS LIVE
404,00:29:24.77,00:29:24.77,"BEFORE ME AND SPEAKS TO ME, I CANNOT FOLLOW PETE, ARTIS, AND"
405,00:29:32.10,00:29:32.10,"ABI, AS LONG AS I HAVE SOME ASSURANCE THAT JEFF AND CARTER"
406,00:29:35.60,00:29:35.60,AREN'T GOING TO SWITCH OVER TO THE OLD TANDANG TRIBE.
407,00:29:39.20,00:29:39.20,"BECAUSE IF R.C. AND I GO THIS WAY, AND JEFF AND CARTER GO THIS"
408,00:29:42.93,00:29:42.93,"WAY, WHAT HAPPENS? NOTHING GOT GAINED."
409,00:29:50.47,00:29:50.47,">> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, MAN? SO THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF"
410,00:29:54.67,00:29:54.67,HERE IS YOU AND I HOLD THE KEY. >> YUP.
411,00:29:58.47,00:29:58.47,>> SO I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
412,00:30:02.10,00:30:02.10,">> WELL, IT'S JONATHAN, SKUPIN, R.C., DENISE, YOU, ME, THAT'S"
413,00:30:07.87,00:30:07.87,ALL WE NEED. >> YUP.
414,00:30:10.07,00:30:10.07,SIX. WE JUST NEED SIX.
415,00:30:14.53,00:30:14.53,>> I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU THINK WE COULD GET
416,00:30:17.73,00:30:17.73,FARTHER WITH SKUPIN AND PENNER? >> I JUST HAD A GOOD
417,00:30:20.90,00:30:20.90,"CONVERSATION WITH SKUPIN, AND I JUST SAID, ""LOOK, IF I DO THIS"
418,00:30:23.77,00:30:23.77,"WITH YOU, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME THAT PENNER WILL NOT STAY HERE"
419,00:30:28.00,00:30:28.00,"LONGER THAN US."" AND HE GAVE ME HIS WORD HE WOULD"
420,00:30:32.17,00:30:32.17,VOTE WITH US TO GET PENNER OUT. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY IS HOW
421,00:30:37.70,00:30:37.70,MUCH-- I MEAN WE BUILT SOME KIND OF VALUE WITH PENNER.
422,00:30:42.63,00:30:42.63,>> YEAH. >> IF YOU AND I JUMP AND GO OVER
423,00:30:46.83,00:30:46.83,"TO THE YELLOW TRIBE, YOU AND I JUST MAY BE ON THE BOTTOM."
424,00:30:50.80,00:30:50.80,">> HERE COMES PENNER BEHIND US. >> WHAT'S UP, PENNER?"
425,00:30:56.50,00:30:56.50,>> HOW WE DOING? >> GOOD.
426,00:31:00.50,00:31:00.50,>> WE'RE JUST TALKING THROUGH ALL THE B.S. WE HAVE BEEN
427,00:31:03.63,00:31:03.63,"HEARING. >> WELL, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHERE"
428,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,I STAND. AND I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU GUYS.
429,00:31:08.37,00:31:08.37,I HOPE THE HELL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE WITH THEM AGAINST ME
430,00:31:11.77,00:31:11.77,TONIGHT. YOU HAVE MY LOYALTY.
431,00:31:13.47,00:31:13.47,>> IF THE PEOPLE THEY BELIEVE ARE GOING TO VOTE WITH ME ARE
432,00:31:16.97,00:31:16.97,"REALLY NOT GOING TO VOTE WITH ME, IF ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN"
433,00:31:19.93,00:31:19.93,"SMOKE, THEN I'M A TERRIBLE JUDGE OF CHARACTER."
434,00:31:21.97,00:31:21.97,AND THEN I DON'T REALLY DESERVE TO STAY IN THE GAME.
435,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53,BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SKUPIN AND R.C. AND DENISE AND CARTER AND
436,00:31:30.00,00:31:30.00,"JEFF, THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE WITH ME."
437,00:31:31.53,00:31:31.53,THEY ALL MEAN IT. I REALLY BELIEVE THEY DO.
438,00:31:36.20,00:31:36.20,"LOOK, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT."
439,00:31:38.20,00:31:38.20,"BUT IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN FLIP THIS VOTE, AND WE ARE THE"
440,00:31:42.87,00:31:42.87,LAST PEOPLE STANDING THE FOUR TIGHT KALABAW PEOPLE AND THE TWO
441,00:31:48.70,00:31:48.70,"PEOPLE WE BROUGHT, IN WE CAN TAKE CONTROL."
442,00:31:50.93,00:31:50.93,YOU KNOW? THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.
443,00:31:56.40,00:31:56.40,"WE'RE GOOD, OKAY. WE REALLY ARE GOOD."
444,00:32:08.37,00:32:08.37,>> WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE STILL HANGING.
445,00:32:10.70,00:32:10.70,>> YEAH. >> YOU DOING IT?
446,00:32:14.60,00:32:14.60,>> WE'RE STILL HANGING. YEAH.
447,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67,WE WANT THESE VETERANS OUT OF HERE.
448,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,>> I'M NERVOUS HERE. >> WE'RE ALL NERVOUS HERE ON
449,00:32:21.53,00:32:21.53,"THIS THING. RIGHT NOW, I'M ON A CROSSROADS."
450,00:32:27.00,00:32:27.00,I'M EITHER GOING WITH VETERAN PLAYERS THAT I DON'T WANT TO WIN
451,00:32:30.57,00:32:30.57,"THIS GAME AND RIDE THEM OUT, OR I'M GOING TO GO WITH THE TANDANG"
452,00:32:34.03,00:32:34.03,"TRIBE AND GET PEN ERP OUT OF HERE, BUT THEN I'M ON THE"
453,00:32:36.80,00:32:36.80,BOTTOM. IF YOU TREAT BASEBALL WITH
454,00:32:39.83,00:32:39.83,"DISRESPECT, YOU'LL BE BIT IN THE ASS, AND I KNOW YOU TREAT THIS"
455,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,"GAME WITH DISRESPECT, YOU'LL GET BIT IN THE ASS TOO."
456,00:32:47.43,00:32:47.43,"WITH ALL HUMBLENESS, I SAY THE DECISION OF WHO GOES HOME"
457,00:32:50.40,00:32:50.40,TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE HEAVILY BASED ON WHICH WAY I GO AND WHO
458,00:32:55.00,00:32:55.00,I CARRY OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE I PROTECT
459,00:32:58.43,00:32:58.43,"MYSELF BECAUSE WHATEVER MOVE I MAKE, IT'S NOT GOING TO SIT WELL"
460,00:33:01.77,00:33:01.77,WITH EITHER TRIBE. >> Jeff: FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
461,00:33:23.67,00:33:23.67,"DON'T HAVE A TORCH. GO AHEAD AND GRAB ONE, APPROACH"
462,00:33:27.87,00:33:27.87,"THE FLAME, DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE."
463,00:33:30.63,00:33:30.63,THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
464,00:33:34.07,00:33:34.07,"GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE"
465,00:33:38.63,00:33:38.63,YOU. THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO
466,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,"SOMEBODY TONIGHT. SO, WE'RE MAKING HISTORY."
467,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,THE ORIGINAL TANDANG SIX NEVER LOST.
468,00:33:46.37,00:33:46.37,AND IN 25 SEASONS WE HAVE NEVER HAD A TRIBE NOT GO TO TRIBAL
469,00:33:50.53,00:33:50.53,COUNCIL UNTIL THEY REACHED THE MERGE.
470,00:33:53.27,00:33:53.27,"ON THE FLIP SIDE, DENISE, YOU'VE BEEN TO EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL"
471,00:33:57.27,00:33:57.27,COUNCIL SINCE THE GAME STARTED. >> EVERY ONE.
472,00:33:59.80,00:33:59.80,>> Jeff: AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS YOU'VE SURVIVED.
473,00:34:02.07,00:34:02.07,>> I SOMEHOW SURVIVED IT ONE MORE TIME.
474,00:34:07.93,00:34:07.93,"I'M SAFE. >> Jeff: SKUPIN, 19 DAYS IN"
475,00:34:09.97,00:34:09.97,THERE HAS TO BE SOME ANIMOSITY WITHIN TANDANG.
476,00:34:12.37,00:34:12.37,>> TRUE. LITTLE FRACT STARTED TO OCCUR
477,00:34:16.17,00:34:16.17,BUT IT'S KIND OF NATURAL TO HAPPEN WHEN SIX OR SEVEN PEOPLE
478,00:34:18.60,00:34:18.60,"GET TOGETHER. YET, WE STILL PULLED OUT"
479,00:34:21.17,00:34:21.17,"VICTORIES. >> Jeff: R.C., HOW BAD HAS IT"
480,00:34:24.20,00:34:24.20,GOTTEN AT CAMP? >> IT WAS PRETTY BAD AT TANDANG.
481,00:34:26.93,00:34:26.93,BUT WE'RE A FAMILY. FAMILIES FIGHT SOMETIMES.
482,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,">> Jeff: ABI, THERE'S ONLY ONE WINNER."
483,00:34:32.13,00:34:32.13,FAMILIES DON'T WIN SURVIVE. >> RIGHT.
484,00:34:34.40,00:34:34.40,AND THE GAME HAS BEEN SHIFTING CONSTANTLY.
485,00:34:36.47,00:34:36.47,I WAS VERY CLOSE TO R.C. IN THE BEGINNING.
486,00:34:38.50,00:34:38.50,"HOWEVER, SHE BETRAYED ME. SO I HAD TO MOVE ON TO A"
487,00:34:43.00,00:34:43.00,DIFFERENT ALLIANCE. >> I AM GLAD THIS FINALLY CAME
488,00:34:45.83,00:34:45.83,UP BECAUSE I'M STILL UNAWARE OF HOW I BETRAYED HER.
489,00:34:49.10,00:34:49.10,">> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED, ABI? >> WE FOUND THE CLUE FOR THE"
490,00:34:52.03,00:34:52.03,"IMMUNITY IDOL TOGETHER, AND HID THE CLUE TOGETHER."
491,00:34:56.30,00:34:56.30,"HOWEVER, SHE UNBURIED THE CLUE WITHOUT TELLING ME, SO I CAN'T"
492,00:34:59.63,00:34:59.63,TRUST HER. >> I DIDN'T UNBURY ANYTHING.
493,00:35:02.27,00:35:02.27,"I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING. >> I MEAN, IT WASN'T ME."
494,00:35:06.63,00:35:06.63,>> IT WASN'T ME. >> AND THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
495,00:35:08.57,00:35:08.57,BUT YOU BLEW UP AND WOULDN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH ME.
496,00:35:10.53,00:35:10.53,">> I TRUST MY ACTIONS, NOT YOURS >> Jeff: SO, LISA, WHEN YOU"
497,00:35:18.00,00:35:18.00,"HEAR TWO TRIBE MATES FROM THE ORIGINAL TANDANG SIX ARGUING,"
498,00:35:22.17,00:35:22.17,CONCERN YOU AT ALL THAT SOMEBODY FROM KALABAW MIGHT COME OVER AND
499,00:35:25.90,00:35:25.90,"SAY, ""LETCH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM"
500,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,IS. COME OVER HERE AND WE HAVE FIVE
501,00:35:30.73,00:35:30.73,"AND WE CONTROL THIS GAME."" >> IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE"
502,00:35:33.13,00:35:33.13,"WHOLE 11 PEOPLE, THEN THEY WERE TOP DOG HERE STAYING WITH"
503,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03,TANDANG THAN GOING TO KALABAW. AND THEN JUST GETTING VOTED OFF
504,00:35:39.87,00:35:39.87,"AT THE END THERE. >> Jeff: JEFF, WHAT'S WRONG"
505,00:35:43.07,00:35:43.07,WITH LISA'S ARGUMENT? >> THERE'S A TRIBE THAT COMES IN
506,00:35:45.53,00:35:45.53,"WITH FOUR, AND IS OFFERING A FIVE SLOT VERSUS A SIX OR A"
507,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,"SEVEN SLOT, THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR A GAME--CHANGING SWITCH."
508,00:35:55.33,00:35:55.33,">> BUT ONCE YOU FLIP, YOU'RE NOT REALLY A STRONG NUMBER."
509,00:35:58.13,00:35:58.13,YOU'RE A WEAKER NUMBER BECAUSE YOU'VE SHOWN THAT YOU CAN'T BE
510,00:36:01.77,00:36:01.77,TRUSTED IN YOUR ALLIANCE. >> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT
511,00:36:07.03,00:36:07.03,RETURNING PLAYERS. TWO OF THEM ARE STILL IN THE
512,00:36:08.97,00:36:08.97,"GAME, SKUPIN AND PENNER. PETE, IS THERE A GROUP THOUGHT"
513,00:36:11.70,00:36:11.70,IN TERMS OF YOU HAD YOUR SHOT? GET OUT?
514,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,">> I MEAN, EVERY SEASON WHERE THEY RETURN PLAYERS, USUALLY"
515,00:36:18.30,00:36:18.30,PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT THEY'RE HERE.
516,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,"I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT TO PLAY THE GAME BEFORE."
517,00:36:22.80,00:36:22.80,SO THERE'S ALWAYS A KIND OF MUTINY FEELING.
518,00:36:25.43,00:36:25.43,BUT TANDANG HAS NEVER HAD TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL SO YOU NEVER
519,00:36:28.70,00:36:28.70,REALLY KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
520,00:36:30.77,00:36:30.77,>> Jeff: IT'S ALSO ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHY KALABAW IS LICKING
521,00:36:35.30,00:36:35.30,THEIR CHOPS. R.C. COULD BE UP FOR GRAPS.
522,00:36:38.00,00:36:38.00,YOU SKUPIN COULD BE UP FOR GRABS.
523,00:36:40.87,00:36:40.87,AND LISA IS THERE ANY CONCERN MALCOLM AND DENISE STARTED THE
524,00:36:44.73,00:36:44.73,GAME TOGETHER. THEY'RE BOTH STILL HERE AND NOW
525,00:36:46.97,00:36:46.97,THEY'RE BACK TOGETHER? >> ABSOLUTELY.
526,00:36:48.10,00:36:48.10,IT'S A HUGE CONCERN AND IT BRICKS UP SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T
527,00:36:52.27,00:36:52.27,ADDRESSED. THERE'S ALSO EVERY POSSIBILITY
528,00:36:55.40,00:36:55.40,THAT SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE BOTTOM FLOOR IS THINKING IF I
529,00:36:58.27,00:36:58.27,"COME OVER TO TANDANG, MAYBE I CAN STAY A LITTLE LONGER."
530,00:37:01.40,00:37:01.40,I WON'T BE TOP DOG BUT AT LEAST I WON'T BE THE DOG KICKED TO THE
531,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,SIDE OF THE ROAD SO THERE IS ALSO THAT POSSIBILITY THAT COULD
532,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,"BE HAPPENING. >> Jeff: SO, PETE, WHAT'S THE"
533,00:37:11.37,00:37:11.37,CONSENSUS ON THE IDOLS? HOW MANY MIGHT THERE BE IN PLAY
534,00:37:14.37,00:37:14.37,TONIGHT? >> I THINK THERE WERE TWO IN THE
535,00:37:15.27,00:37:15.27,GAME RIGHT NOW. I'M PRETTY SURE MASTING'S IS
536,00:37:21.07,00:37:21.07,"GONE. >> Jeff: PETE, CONCERNED IT"
537,00:37:22.03,00:37:22.03,"COULD BE YOU TONIGHT? CLEARLY, ARE YOU ONE OF THE FIT,"
