86,00:04:27.13,00:04:27.13,TEARS ME APART THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO EVENTUALLY

176,00:11:08.23,00:11:08.23,LOOK AT THAT THING. >> I'M ACTUALLY GLAD TONY
177,00:11:10.90,00:11:10.90,PICKED TRISH FOR THE REWARD BECAUSE IT JUST SOLIDIFIES
178,00:11:13.77,00:11:13.77,THAT THOSE TWO ARE LOCKED TOGETHER.
179,00:11:16.03,00:11:16.03,TONY IS THE ALPHA MALE OUT HERE AND SHE'S THE FEMALE.
180,00:11:18.97,00:11:18.97,THEY ARE LIKE A COUPLE OF BABOONS.

184,00:11:29.80,00:11:29.80,MUCH POWER. THE PIZZA REWARD IS KIND OF
185,00:11:40.73,00:11:40.73,LIKE A METAPHOR FOR WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE GAME.
186,00:11:43.77,00:11:43.77,"TONY IS WINNING. HE'S TAKING LONG TRISH, AND"
187,00:11:46.97,00:11:46.97,NO ONE SEEMS TO BE BOTHERED BY THAT.

241,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,"BULLY, JUST AN EXTREMELY UNLIKEABLE PERSON."
242,00:14:46.03,00:14:46.03,AND HE WON'T GET ANY VOTES FROM THE JURY.
243,00:14:49.17,00:14:49.17,SO CHAOS KASS IS BACK. WOO TOLD ME EVERYTHING I

263,00:15:48.03,00:15:48.03,ELSE THAT'S TAKING ME TO THE FINAL 3 BECAUSE AT THIS
264,00:15:50.00,00:15:50.00,POINT YOU WANT AS MUCH PARANOIAS YOU CAN STIR UP
265,00:15:53.40,00:15:53.40,ESPECIALLY AMONG TIGHT TIGHT PEOPLE SO HE JUST SCREWED
266,00:15:56.80,00:15:56.80,HIMSELF BECAUSE NOW PERHAPS WOO DOESN'T TRUST HIM.
267,00:16:00.27,00:16:00.27,>> SO. >> PLEASE DON'T TALK TO ME.
268,00:16:03.70,00:16:03.70,>> EVERYBODY IS A LAWED TO TALK TO TONY BUT NOBODY IS
269,00:16:05.97,00:16:05.97,ALLOWED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.
270,00:16:07.63,00:16:07.63,>> THAT IS HOW INTELLIGENT YOU ARE.
271,00:16:09.70,00:16:09.70,YOU HAVE NO IDEA. TALKING TO PEOPLE AND REVEALING
272,00:16:12.53,00:16:12.53,SECRETS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ANIMAL.
273,00:16:14.57,00:16:14.57,"WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT, YOU WERE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO"
274,00:16:18.03,00:16:18.03,"TELL HIM. I'M SORRY, I'M SUPPOSED TO"
275,00:16:20.37,00:16:20.37,TALK DRAMA TO YOU. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
276,00:16:23.07,00:16:23.07,BETTER? THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW THAT
277,00:16:25.20,00:16:25.20,BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK. IT'S LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING
278,00:16:27.27,00:16:27.27,ME. STRATEGICALLY KASS IS
279,00:16:29.43,00:16:29.43,PERFECT TO BRING TO THE END BUT SHE'S SUCH AN INSULT TO
280,00:16:32.00,00:16:32.00,THIS GAME.
281,00:16:34.70,00:16:34.70,"THIS GAME. SO AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,"
282,00:16:35.47,00:16:35.47,WE'RE DONE.
283,00:16:52.00,00:16:52.00,TONY I WANT YOU TO NOW 
284,00:16:54.27,00:16:54.27,THAT WHAT I DID WAS STRATEGIC.
285,00:16:56.00,00:16:56.00,I DON'T TRUST YOU TONY.
286,00:16:58.00,00:16:58.00,"I KNOW THAT, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM"
287,00:16:59.23,00:16:59.23,YOU'RE OWN WORST ENEMY.
288,00:17:00.00,00:17:00.00,NOW ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE
289,00:17:01.00,00:17:01.00,DOESN'T KNOW IF HE'S ONE 
290,00:17:01.90,00:17:01.90,OF YOUR PEOPLE.
291,00:17:05.20,00:17:05.20,WHAT ARE YOU DIGGING FOR NOW
292,00:17:06.00,00:17:06.00,PLEASE THAT'S ENOUGH.
293,00:17:12.83,00:17:12.83,LET ME CHECK TO SEE IF THAT TREE IS RIPE WITH COCONUT.
294,00:17:19.83,00:17:19.83,"I'M KIND OF OVER THE WHOLE TONY THING,"
295,00:17:22.27,00:17:22.27,BUT WU YOU NEEDED TO KNOW THAT STUFF.
296,00:17:25.70,00:17:25.70,HE WAS GOING TO TAKE ME TO THE FINAL THREE.
297,00:17:27.97,00:17:27.97,TO ME HE WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES WHEN HE TELLS WU SOMETHIING
298,00:17:30.70,00:17:30.70,AND HE TELLS ME THE SAME THING.
299,00:17:33.33,00:17:33.33,"A TYPICAL STRATEGY WOULD BE TO GET RID OF TONY, "
300,00:17:36.47,00:17:36.47,"BUT HE HAS AT LEAST ONE IDOL THAT WE ARE AWARE OF,"
301,00:17:39.43,00:17:39.43,PLUS HE'S SUCH A JERK I THINK I CAN BEAT HIM IN THE END.
302,00:17:43.40,00:17:43.40,SO I THINK THE BEST OPTION FOR ME AT THIS POINT
303,00:17:46.37,00:17:46.37,IS TO FILL IN WU AND SPENCER
304,00:17:48.30,00:17:48.30,AND SCRU UP TONY'S GAME.
305,00:17:50.67,00:17:50.67,AND HE REALLY DID PROMISE ON HIS WIFE AND BABY WHICH I'M SURE 
306,00:17:53.23,00:17:53.23,HE PROMISED YOU ON THE BOAT THE OTHER DAY.
307,00:17:57.10,00:17:57.10,DID HE SWEAR ON HIS WIFE AND BABY WITH YOU ON THE BOAT?
308,00:18:00.00,00:18:00.00,HE DIDN'T
309,00:18:06.73,00:18:06.73,WU DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS?
310,00:18:09.77,00:18:09.77,I DO THANK YOU!
311,00:18:22.17,00:18:22.17,NO YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE.
312,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77,THAT'S EXACTLY WHY HE MIGHT NOT.
313,00:18:26.40,00:18:26.40,I THINK HE REALLY WANT TO KEEP ME BECAUSE
314,00:18:28.00,00:18:28.00,HE DOESN'T THINK I CAN WIN.
315,00:18:30.07,00:18:30.07,THAT'S WHY HE'S SO MAD.
316,00:18:34.33,00:18:34.33,>> I HAVE BEEN A CLOSE ALLY WITH TONY PLAYING THIS GAME
317,00:18:37.77,00:18:37.77,WITH HIM SINCE DAY ONE. BUT IT'S COME OUT THAT HE
318,00:18:40.37,00:18:40.37,PROMISED CASS ON HIS WIFE AN BABY GIRL THAT HE WOULD TAKE
319,00:18:43.17,00:18:43.17,HER TO THE FINAL 3. WHICH MEANS THAT I KNOW FOR
320,00:18:47.27,00:18:47.27,ALMOST FOR A FACT THAT TONY WAS GOING TO BLINDSIDE ME SO
321,00:18:51.00,00:18:51.00,MY TRUST IN TONY HAS GONE DOWN TREMENDOUSLY.
322,00:18:54.73,00:18:54.73,"I MEAN WOO IF I GO OUT, RIGHT, TONY AND TRISH ARE"
323,00:18:58.53,00:18:58.53,DECIDING WHICH ONE OF YOU GOES TO THE END WITH THEM
324,00:19:00.30,00:19:00.30,AND WHICH ONE OF THEM GOES HOME.
325,00:19:02.37,00:19:02.37,>> THE QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.
326,00:19:04.70,00:19:04.70,">> WELL, IF YOU WANT TO INSURANCE YOU MAKE THE FINAL"
327,00:19:09.47,00:19:09.47,3. >> GET TRISH.
