287,00:17:00.00,00:17:00.00,NOW ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE
288,00:17:01.00,00:17:01.00,DOESN'T KNOW IF HE'S ONE 
289,00:17:01.90,00:17:01.90,OF YOUR PEOPLE.

297,00:17:30.70,00:17:30.70,AND HE TELLS ME THE SAME THING.
298,00:17:33.33,00:17:33.33,"A TYPICAL STRATEGY WOULD BE TOGET RID OF TONY, "
299,00:17:36.47,00:17:36.47,"BUT HE HAS AT LEAST ONE IDOLTHAT WE ARE AWARE OF,"
300,00:17:39.43,00:17:39.43,PLUS HE'S SUCH A JERK I THINK ICAN BEAT HIM IN THE END.
301,00:17:43.40,00:17:43.40,SO I THINK THE BEST OPTION FORME AT THIS POINT
302,00:17:46.37,00:17:46.37,IS TO FILL IN WU AND SPENCER

312,00:18:26.40,00:18:26.40,I THINK HE REALLY WANT TO KEEPME BECAUSE
313,00:18:28.00,00:18:28.00,HE DOESN'T THINK I CAN WIN.
314,00:18:30.07,00:18:30.07,THAT'S WHY HE'S SO MAD.
