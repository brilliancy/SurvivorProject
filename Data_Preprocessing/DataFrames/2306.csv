145,00:04:50.97,00:04:50.97,THAT WASN'T THE CASE.

158,00:05:09.60,00:05:09.60,DID.
159,00:05:10.27,00:05:10.27,IF HE WOULD HAVE NOT REACTED
160,00:05:12.07,00:05:12.07,SO QUICKLY AND GOT EMOTIONAL HE

189,00:06:04.13,00:06:04.13,BECAUSE I LIKE TO HAVE ALL THE
190,00:06:05.40,00:06:05.40,CARDS ON THE TABLE.

196,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,DOWN THE ROAD.

859,00:27:53.07,00:27:53.07,SUCKS.
860,00:27:53.77,00:27:53.77,NOW WE'VE GOT TO COME BACK TO
861,00:27:54.63,00:27:54.63,CAMP AND WE'VE GOT TO DO THE
862,00:27:56.00,00:27:56.00,DIRTY WORK.
863,00:27:56.67,00:27:56.67,WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE
864,00:27:58.13,00:27:58.13,GOING TO VOTE OFF MIKAYLA OR
865,00:28:02.10,00:28:02.10,EDNA?
866,00:28:02.83,00:28:02.83,NEITHER ONE OF THEM WAS PART OF
867,00:28:03.83,00:28:03.83,THE ORIGINAL FIVE BUT MIKAYLA
868,00:28:06.03,00:28:06.03,WASN'T COACHABLE IN THE
869,00:28:07.73,00:28:07.73,CHALLENGE.
870,00:28:08.40,00:28:08.40,SHE DOESN'T FOLLOW ORDERS SO
871,00:28:09.23,00:28:09.23,SHE'S GOING HOME TONIGHT.
872,00:28:18.07,00:28:18.07,COACH AND BRANDON ARE GOING TO
873,00:28:19.40,00:28:19.40,TRY TO GET YOU BUT I'M NOT GOING
874,00:28:20.83,00:28:20.83,TO LET THAT HAPPEN.
875,00:28:21.60,00:28:21.60,WHY?
876,00:28:22.27,00:28:22.27,"TRUST ME, THERE'S NOTHING TO"
877,00:28:23.57,00:28:23.57,WORRY ABOUT.
878,00:28:24.27,00:28:24.27,I CAN GET COACH TO LISTEN TO ME.
879,00:28:25.60,00:28:25.60,SO WE LOST THE CHALLENGE.
880,00:28:28.13,00:28:28.13,NOW AL TOLD ME THAT COACH IS
881,00:28:30.60,00:28:30.60,"SKEPTICAL ABOUT ME, AND IT JUST"
882,00:28:32.20,00:28:32.20,MAKES ME LAUGH BECAUSE ALL THESE
883,00:28:34.53,00:28:34.53,"PEOPLE ARE ABOUT STRENGTH, AND"
884,00:28:37.30,00:28:37.30,YOU'RE REALLY THROWING MY NAME
885,00:28:38.57,00:28:38.57,UP AGAIN.
886,00:28:39.27,00:28:39.27,"THE GIRL WHO IS HALF MY SIZE,"
887,00:28:42.40,00:28:42.40,"ALMOST DOUBLE MY AGE, YOU HAVE"
888,00:28:43.83,00:28:43.83,TO BE KIDDING ME.
889,00:28:44.70,00:28:44.70,COACH WILL DEFINITELY GO WITH
890,00:28:46.40,00:28:46.40,ME.
891,00:28:46.90,00:28:46.90,IT'S 100% CERTAIN.
892,00:28:48.50,00:28:48.50,"IT SUCKS, BUT I DEFINITELY DO"
893,00:28:51.63,00:28:51.63,"TRUST AL, AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN"
894,00:28:53.40,00:28:53.40,"TO IT, HOPEFULLY HE'LL TRUST IN"
895,00:28:55.80,00:28:55.80,ME.
896,00:28:59.00,00:28:59.00,"LISTEN, GUYS, I KNOW THAT"
897,00:29:00.50,00:29:00.50,EDNA WAS BROUGHT IN AS THE SIXTH
898,00:29:02.57,00:29:02.57,"PERSON, BUT EDNA HAS ZERO"
899,00:29:04.77,00:29:04.77,"CHALLENGE VALUES, ZERO."
900,00:29:07.20,00:29:07.20,"WELL, THAT'S WHY WE HAD EDNA"
901,00:29:09.07,00:29:09.07,SIT OUT TODAY.
902,00:29:09.73,00:29:09.73,THAT'S REASON WE SAT HER OUT
903,00:29:11.47,00:29:11.47,TO BEGIN WITH AND IF WE LOSE
904,00:29:13.00,00:29:13.00,"THIS NEXT ONE, WE'RE IN A"
905,00:29:14.60,00:29:14.60,"TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE SPOT."
906,00:29:15.40,00:29:15.40,"IF I HAD TO DO A ""SURVIVOR"""
907,00:29:18.43,00:29:18.43,DRAFT AND HAD EDNA AND MIKAYLA
908,00:29:20.53,00:29:20.53,"NEXT TO EACH OTHER, IT'S A NO"
909,00:29:22.73,00:29:22.73,BRAINER.
910,00:29:23.27,00:29:23.27,I'D GO WITH MIKAYLA.
911,00:29:26.47,00:29:26.47,EDNA IS A SHARP PLAYER WHO IS
912,00:29:28.43,00:29:28.43,GOING TO BE TACTICAL AND THAT'S
913,00:29:30.03,00:29:30.03,WAY TOO DANGEROUS.
914,00:29:30.80,00:29:30.80,MY FEAR IS THIS-- SHE'S SMART
915,00:29:32.30,00:29:32.30,ENOUGH TO KNOW SHE'S THE SIXTH
916,00:29:33.83,00:29:33.83,PERSON.
917,00:29:34.50,00:29:34.50,"OH, YEAH, SHE'S BY FAR SMART"
918,00:29:37.00,00:29:37.00,ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT.
919,00:29:37.77,00:29:37.77,AND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THEY'RE
920,00:29:39.03,00:29:39.03,THE SIXTH PERSON IS GOING TO
921,00:29:40.87,00:29:40.87,MAYBE REACT DESPERATELY WHEN WE
922,00:29:42.57,00:29:42.57,GET TO A MERGE.
923,00:29:43.60,00:29:43.60,EDNA HAS BEEN BUSTING HER
924,00:29:45.87,00:29:45.87,ASS FOR US AND I DON'T KNOW IF
925,00:29:47.13,00:29:47.13,SHE'S GOING IN THE BACK OF HER
926,00:29:48.53,00:29:48.53,"MIND YOU LAZY, NO GOOD PUKES."
927,00:29:51.07,00:29:51.07,ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT
928,00:29:52.40,00:29:52.40,DECISION?
929,00:29:53.07,00:29:53.07,I THINK IT'S THE BEST FOR US
930,00:29:54.10,00:29:54.10,FIVE.
931,00:29:54.77,00:29:54.77,"HOW ARE YOU FEELING, SOPHIE."
932,00:29:57.43,00:29:57.43,WE'RE ALL CONVINCED NAIS
933,00:29:59.80,00:29:59.80,GOING HOME BUT WE NEED TO
934,00:30:02.73,00:30:02.73,CONVINCE BRANDON AND COACH OF
935,00:30:04.87,00:30:04.87,THAT.
936,00:30:05.47,00:30:05.47,"HONESTLY, THE WAY WE CAME"
937,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,TOGETHER ON DAY TWO WAS REAL AND
938,00:30:09.87,00:30:09.87,LEGITIMATE.
939,00:30:10.53,00:30:10.53,AND THE WAY I FEEL EDNA WAS
940,00:30:11.50,00:30:11.50,"BROUGHT INTO THAT GROUP, IT"
941,00:30:13.50,00:30:13.50,WASN'T AS AUTHENTIC.
942,00:30:14.70,00:30:14.70,I UNDERSTAND.
943,00:30:15.83,00:30:15.83,"AND, HONESTLY, IF I CAN CHANGE"
944,00:30:18.03,00:30:18.03,"BACK TIME, HONESTLY, I WOULD NOT"
945,00:30:20.20,00:30:20.20,VOTE MIKAYLA OFF THIS TRIBE.
946,00:30:23.10,00:30:23.10,I'M UNEASY ABOUT EDNA.
947,00:30:24.40,00:30:24.40,SHE'S GOT THIS LOOK ON HER FACE
948,00:30:26.90,00:30:26.90,"LIKE SHE'S PLAYING PEOPLE, AND I"
949,00:30:28.00,00:30:28.00,DON'T LIKE IT.
950,00:30:28.73,00:30:28.73,I DON'T LIKE IT.
951,00:30:30.13,00:30:30.13,I'M STARTING TO TRUST MIKAYLA
952,00:30:31.83,00:30:31.83,MORE BECAUSE EDNA IS JUST--
953,00:30:33.20,00:30:33.20,"SHE'S ACTING TOO, TOO SWEET TO"
954,00:30:35.67,00:30:35.67,NOT BE PLAYING US.
955,00:30:37.00,00:30:37.00,I DON'T KNOW IF EDNA IS FULL OF
956,00:30:39.07,00:30:39.07,ME.
957,00:30:39.77,00:30:39.77,I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING.
958,00:30:41.23,00:30:41.23,BUT I'M STARTING TO NOT TRUST
959,00:30:43.20,00:30:43.20,HER.
960,00:30:43.90,00:30:43.90,BUT I WANT TO BE A RADICAL FOR
961,00:30:45.63,00:30:45.63,GOD WHEN IT COMES TO DOING
962,00:30:47.70,00:30:47.70,"RIGHT, DOING GOOD, MAN."
963,00:30:48.87,00:30:48.87,I WOULD RATHER VOTE EDNA OUT OF
964,00:30:50.43,00:30:50.43,THIS TRIBE TODAY BUT I'M NOT
965,00:30:51.70,00:30:51.70,"GOING TO, BECAUSE I AM MY WORD."
966,00:30:53.57,00:30:53.57,EVERYONE AT ONE POINT IN TIME
967,00:30:55.07,00:30:55.07,"SAID, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE"
968,00:30:56.53,00:30:56.53,EDNA FOR OUR SIXTH.
969,00:30:57.70,00:30:57.70,AND I'M GOING TO STICK TO MY
970,00:30:59.30,00:30:59.30,WORD IF IT COSTS ME THE GAME.
971,00:31:01.70,00:31:01.70,I PRAY YOU GUYS RESPECT THAT.
972,00:31:04.67,00:31:04.67,BRENDAN ACTUALLY WANTS EDNA
973,00:31:06.43,00:31:06.43,TO LEAVE.
974,00:31:07.10,00:31:07.10,HE LIKES MIKAYLA BETTER NOW.
975,00:31:08.80,00:31:08.80,HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.
976,00:31:10.27,00:31:10.27,SHE'S NO LONGER THE WHORE OF THE
977,00:31:13.67,00:31:13.67,"TRIBE, BUT HE'S STILL GOING TO"
978,00:31:15.07,00:31:15.07,VOTE HER OUT.
979,00:31:15.77,00:31:15.77,I DON'T GET IT.
980,00:31:16.63,00:31:16.63,"HE IS NUTS, ABSOLUTELY NUTS."
981,00:31:19.67,00:31:19.67,THIS SUCKS.
982,00:31:21.13,00:31:21.13,"BRANDON IS THE KIND OF GUY THAT,"
983,00:31:22.87,00:31:22.87,"UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T TALK"
984,00:31:24.23,00:31:24.23,STRATEGY WITH.
985,00:31:25.10,00:31:25.10,YOU TALK MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES
986,00:31:26.47,00:31:26.47,OF STRATEGY WITH HIM HE STARTS
987,00:31:28.63,00:31:28.63,GRABBING HIS HEAD AND IS ABOUT
988,00:31:31.10,00:31:31.10,TO CRY.
989,00:31:31.80,00:31:31.80,"I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,"
990,00:31:33.13,00:31:33.13,I THINK RIGHT NOW AT THIS STAGE
991,00:31:34.43,00:31:34.43,KEEPING EDNA IS A MISTAKE.
992,00:31:35.70,00:31:35.70,I THINK THE VALUE EDNA BRINGS TO
993,00:31:37.80,00:31:37.80,CHALLENGES IS NOTHING.
994,00:31:38.67,00:31:38.67,"I LOVE EDNA, DUDE, BUT NEXT"
995,00:31:40.97,00:31:40.97,CHALLENGE IS MAKE OR BREAK.
996,00:31:41.93,00:31:41.93,I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT
997,00:31:43.43,00:31:43.43,"NOW FROM ONE COACH TO ANOTHER, I"
998,00:31:45.00,00:31:45.00,LOST THE CHALLENGE TODAY.
999,00:31:45.70,00:31:45.70,YOU DEPARTMENT LOSE THE
1000,00:31:46.80,00:31:46.80,CHALLENGE.
1001,00:31:47.30,00:31:47.30,"LISTEN, NO, I DID."
1002,00:31:48.40,00:31:48.40,BECAUSE NOBODY LISTENED TO ME
1003,00:31:50.27,00:31:50.27,TODAY.
1004,00:31:50.97,00:31:50.97,I TOLD MIKAYLA STOP SHOOTING.
1005,00:31:53.43,00:31:53.43,SHE'S LIKE I GOT THIS.
1006,00:31:55.93,00:31:55.93,SHE DIDN'T GET A THING.
1007,00:31:58.77,00:31:58.77,"IF I HAD TOLD EDNA, STOP IT."
1008,00:32:01.90,00:32:01.90,SHE WOULD HAVE STOPPED.
1009,00:32:03.67,00:32:03.67,MIKAYLA HAS NOT WON ANYTHING FOR
1010,00:32:05.63,00:32:05.63,US.
1011,00:32:06.37,00:32:06.37,"EDNA, IF YOU WERE TATOLL HER AT"
1012,00:32:09.17,00:32:09.17,"THE MERGE, ""EDNA,IMENT TO FOLLOW"
1013,00:32:11.90,00:32:11.90,OZZY WHEN HAD HE TAKES A
1014,00:32:14.77,00:32:14.77,"( BLEEP ) AND WIPE IT FOR HIM."""
1015,00:32:16.40,00:32:16.40,I THINK SHE'S PLAYING US WHEN
1016,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,IT COMES TO LOYALTY.
1017,00:32:19.43,00:32:19.43,"ALBERT, I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT"
1018,00:32:20.90,00:32:20.90,NOW I'D RATHER TAKE EDNA INTO
1019,00:32:23.00,00:32:23.00,BATTLE THAN MIKAYLA.
1020,00:32:24.10,00:32:24.10,THE REASON COACH WANTS TO
1021,00:32:25.30,00:32:25.30,KEEP EDNA IS COACH FEELS EDNA IS
1022,00:32:28.23,00:32:28.23,DIRECTLY IN HIS POCKET.
1023,00:32:29.03,00:32:29.03,HE THINKS SHE'S GOING TO LISTEN
1024,00:32:30.63,00:32:30.63,TO EVERYTHING HE SAYS AND FOLLOW
1025,00:32:32.50,00:32:32.50,HIM BLINDLY TO THE END.
1026,00:32:33.67,00:32:33.67,MY CAP IS OFF TO COACH FOR
1027,00:32:35.03,00:32:35.03,HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF STRATEGY
1028,00:32:36.23,00:32:36.23,"IN THIS, BUT REALISTICALLY,"
1029,00:32:38.87,00:32:38.87,KEEPING EDIA AROUND IS A BAD
1030,00:32:40.40,00:32:40.40,PLAY FOR US WINNING THE NEXT
1031,00:32:41.83,00:32:41.83,CHALLENGE AND IT'S A BAD PLAY
1032,00:32:43.40,00:32:43.40,FOR ME IN MY END GAME.
1033,00:32:47.00,00:32:47.00,I JUST WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
1034,00:32:48.37,00:32:48.37,"OH, YEAH."
1035,00:32:49.13,00:32:49.13,MAN TO MAN.
1036,00:32:50.53,00:32:50.53,I FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE TRYING TO
1037,00:32:52.10,00:32:52.10,BE A LITTLE BIT RAILROADED RIGHT
1038,00:32:54.77,00:32:54.77,NOW.
1039,00:32:55.20,00:32:55.20,YOU KNOW WHAT?
1040,00:32:55.87,00:32:55.87,NUMBER ONE IS GETTING TO THE
1041,00:32:56.77,00:32:56.77,MERGE WITH NUMBERS.
1042,00:32:58.27,00:32:58.27,NUMBER TWO IS HAVING SOMEBODY
1043,00:32:59.47,00:32:59.47,YOU CAN TRUST THROUGH THICK AND
1044,00:33:01.07,00:33:01.07,THIN.
1045,00:33:01.63,00:33:01.63,EDNA IS LOYAL.
1046,00:33:02.63,00:33:02.63,ALBERT AND SOPHIE MIGHT THINK
1047,00:33:03.93,00:33:03.93,EDNA IS GOING HOME BUT I'M GOING
1048,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IF I HAVE
1049,00:33:06.67,00:33:06.67,ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT THAT'S
1050,00:33:07.83,00:33:07.83,NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
1051,00:33:09.03,00:33:09.03,ALBERT SAYS SHE'S PLAYING US BUT
1052,00:33:10.90,00:33:10.90,EDNA WILL DO WHAT SHE'S TOLD.
1053,00:33:12.33,00:33:12.33,I WANT TO BE FORTUNE UNIFIED AS
1054,00:33:14.23,00:33:14.23,THE FIVE OF US AND IF YOU CAN ME
1055,00:33:16.63,00:33:16.63,"WHAT MY GUT FEELING IS, GET RID"
1056,00:33:18.87,00:33:18.87,OF MIKAYLA.
1057,00:33:19.73,00:33:19.73,I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO
1058,00:33:21.70,00:33:21.70,SEND EDNA HOME BUT I TALKED WITH
1059,00:33:23.30,00:33:23.30,COACH AND HE WANTS TO VOTE FOR
1060,00:33:26.33,00:33:26.33,MIKAYLA.
1061,00:33:26.97,00:33:26.97,"COWBOY, I WANT TO TELL YOU"
1062,00:33:27.67,00:33:27.67,"RIGHT NOW, MAN, THE VOTE'S IN"
1063,00:33:29.47,00:33:29.47,YOUR HANDS 100%.
1064,00:33:30.83,00:33:30.83,I DON'T THINK ME AND SOVIET

1082,00:34:19.00,00:34:19.00,BLEW IT.
1083,00:34:19.60,00:34:19.60,WHAT HAPPENED?
1084,00:34:20.30,00:34:20.30,WE JUST DIDN'T REALLY COMPETE
1085,00:34:21.83,00:34:21.83,AS A TEAM TODAY.
1086,00:34:23.07,00:34:23.07,"YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE"
1087,00:34:25.20,00:34:25.20,YELLING AT PEOPLE AND MIKAYLA
1088,00:34:27.13,00:34:27.13,AND I WERE BOTH MISSES SHOTS.
1089,00:34:30.30,00:34:30.30,"I SAID, MIKAYLA, MAYBE SHU STOP"
1090,00:34:32.77,00:34:32.77,LET ALBERT DO IT.
1091,00:34:34.03,00:34:34.03,"SHE SAID NO, LET ME DO IT."
1092,00:34:35.73,00:34:35.73,I GOT THE FEEL OF IT.
1093,00:34:37.00,00:34:37.00,"Jeff: MIKAYLA, YOUR"
1094,00:34:38.30,00:34:38.30,EXPRESSION SAYS YOU DON'T AGREE
1095,00:34:39.47,00:34:39.47,WITH THIS AT ALL.
1096,00:34:40.47,00:34:40.47,"WELL, DURING THE GAME,"
1097,00:34:42.40,00:34:42.40,"OBVIOUSLY, AL WAS HOT."
1098,00:34:44.10,00:34:44.10,BUT THERE WAS NEVER A POINT
1099,00:34:45.20,00:34:45.20,"WHERE COACH SAID MUCALLA, LET AL"
1100,00:34:48.97,00:34:48.97,DO THE REST OF IT.
1101,00:34:50.20,00:34:50.20,"Jeff: MIKAYLA AONCE AGAIN,"
1102,00:34:52.53,00:34:52.53,YOUR TRIBE SAT YOU OUT OF THE
1103,00:34:54.47,00:34:54.47,CHALLENGE.
1104,00:34:55.17,00:34:55.17,WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU THINK YOUR
1105,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83,TRIBE IS SENDING YOU?

1109,00:35:01.77,00:35:01.77,IT IS WITH ME.
1110,00:35:04.03,00:35:04.03,Jeff: BRANDON IS THERE MUCH
1111,00:35:06.07,00:35:06.07,TALK ABOUT THE MERGE AND BEING
1112,00:35:07.67,00:35:07.67,UP OR DOWN WITH THE NUMBERS?
1113,00:35:09.07,00:35:09.07,ABSOLUTELY.
1114,00:35:09.77,00:35:09.77,WE HAVE TO BE UP IN NUMBERS IN
1115,00:35:11.73,00:35:11.73,THE MERGE.
1116,00:35:12.43,00:35:12.43,THIS NEXT CHALLENGE IS
1117,00:35:14.30,00:35:14.30,ABSOLUTELY DETRIMENTAL TO THE
1118,00:35:16.30,00:35:16.30,WAY THIS GAME TURNS OUT.
1119,00:35:17.43,00:35:17.43,Jeff: THERE ARE TWO SIDES
1120,00:35:18.90,00:35:18.90,TO THAT COIN.
1121,00:35:19.73,00:35:19.73,ONE IS DO YOU KEEP THE PLAYER
1122,00:35:21.33,00:35:21.33,THAT WILL HELP YOU GET TO THE
1123,00:35:22.70,00:35:22.70,MERGE OR DO YOU KEEP THE PLAYER
1124,00:35:24.57,00:35:24.57,WHO WILL BE LOYAL AFTER A MERGE?
1125,00:35:25.73,00:35:25.73,"YOU GOTTA GET THERE, BUT YOU"
1126,00:35:27.13,00:35:27.13,WANT TO GET THERE WITH PEOPLE
1127,00:35:28.80,00:35:28.80,WHO ARE GOING TO BE LOYAL.
1128,00:35:30.40,00:35:30.40,WHAT'S NUMBERS IF ONE OR TWO
1129,00:35:31.50,00:35:31.50,PEOPLE ON YOUR TRIBE IS NOT
1130,00:35:33.10,00:35:33.10,LOYAL?
1131,00:35:33.70,00:35:33.70,IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
1132,00:35:34.50,00:35:34.50,"Jeff: ALBERT, WHAT IF THE"
1133,00:35:36.10,00:35:36.10,PERSON YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
1134,00:35:37.97,00:35:37.97,BEING LOYAL IS THE SAME PERSON
1135,00:35:38.97,00:35:38.97,WHO HELPS YOU GET TO THE MERGE
1136,00:35:40.77,00:35:40.77,WITH NUMBERS?
1137,00:35:41.43,00:35:41.43,IF THE ONE PERSON THAT HELPS
1138,00:35:43.53,00:35:43.53,YOU GET TO THE MERGE ISN'T THE
1139,00:35:46.53,00:35:46.53,"MOST LOYAL, TO ME THAT'S"
1140,00:35:47.80,00:35:47.80,SOMETHING WE HAVE TO COMPROMISE
1141,00:35:49.67,00:35:49.67,BECAUSE IN THIS GAME IT'S OF THE
1142,00:35:51.70,00:35:51.70,UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO GET TO THE
1143,00:35:53.07,00:35:53.07,MERGE WITH NUMBERS AND AN EDGE.
1144,00:35:54.57,00:35:54.57,Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING CAN'T
1145,00:35:55.67,00:35:55.67,WORRY ABOUT THE LOYALTY AFTER
1146,00:35:56.63,00:35:56.63,THE MERGE IF YOU DON'T GET TO
1147,00:35:57.87,00:35:57.87,THE MERGE.
1148,00:35:58.47,00:35:58.47,RIGHT.
1149,00:35:59.10,00:35:59.10,"Jeff: SOPHIE, WHERE DO YOU"
1150,00:36:00.50,00:36:00.50,FALL ON THIS MERGE ARGUMENT?
1151,00:36:01.53,00:36:01.53,I THINK YOU GO IN DOWN
1152,00:36:03.90,00:36:03.90,"NUMBERS IN THE MERGE IT, DOESN'T"
1153,00:36:05.37,00:36:05.37,MATTER IF EVERYBODY IS LOYAL.
1154,00:36:06.53,00:36:06.53,IT DOESN'T.
1155,00:36:07.23,00:36:07.23,YOU HAVE TO GO IN WITH AS MANY
1156,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,AS YOU CAN AND BE AS STRONG AS
1157,00:36:10.30,00:36:10.30,YOU CAN.
1158,00:36:10.87,00:36:10.87,"Jeff: COACH, A DIVIDED"
1159,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,TRIBE.
1160,00:36:12.63,00:36:12.63,A FEW PEOPLE THINK TAKE THE BEST
1161,00:36:13.83,00:36:13.83,TO THE MERGE.
1162,00:36:15.37,00:36:15.37,WE'LL DOOL WITH LOYALTY LATER.
1163,00:36:17.80,00:36:17.80,AND SOME OF THE OTHERS SAY DEAL
1164,00:36:19.07,00:36:19.07,WITH LOYALTY RIGHT NOW.
1165,00:36:19.93,00:36:19.93,ABSOLUTELY.
1166,00:36:20.53,00:36:20.53,IT DOES DIVIDE THE TRIBE.
1167,00:36:22.30,00:36:22.30,FOR ME YOU KNOW WHAT MY ANSWER
1168,00:36:25.53,00:36:25.53,"IS GOING TO BE, HONOR, LOYALTY,"
1169,00:36:26.63,00:36:26.63,INTEGRITY.
1170,00:36:28.67,00:36:28.67,THE ONE THING THAT WORRIES ME
1171,00:36:30.13,00:36:30.13,IS LOYALTY CAN BE FAKED.
1172,00:36:31.70,00:36:31.70,YOU CAN'T FAKE STRENGTH.
1173,00:36:32.73,00:36:32.73,A REALLY GOOD PERSON REQUEST CON
1174,00:36:34.43,00:36:34.43,PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THEY'RE
1175,00:36:35.87,00:36:35.87,LOYAL.
1176,00:36:36.50,00:36:36.50,IT'S HARD TO CON PEOPLE TO
1177,00:36:39.17,00:36:39.17,"BELIEVE YOU'RE REALLY GOOD,"
1178,00:36:40.93,00:36:40.93,ATHLETIC AND STRONG.
1179,00:36:42.17,00:36:42.17,Jeff: BRANDON.
1180,00:36:42.87,00:36:42.87,I'M REALLY TRYING TO BE QUIET
1181,00:36:44.37,00:36:44.37,BUT I CAN'T.
1182,00:36:45.47,00:36:45.47,LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WE WERE
1183,00:36:46.37,00:36:46.37,"TALKING LOYAL, LOYAL, LOYAL."
1184,00:36:47.43,00:36:47.43,AND THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL WE'RE
1185,00:36:48.73,00:36:48.73,TALKING LOYAL.
1186,00:36:49.63,00:36:49.63,HOW COME WE'RE SPLIT?
1187,00:36:51.40,00:36:51.40,WE ALL MADE A PACT TO HAVE SIX
1188,00:36:53.33,00:36:53.33,PEOPLE THAT WERE GOING TO MAKE
1189,00:36:54.37,00:36:54.37,"IT AND WE WERE GOING TO STAY,"
1190,00:36:56.07,00:36:56.07,AND WE CHOSE TO KEEP EDNA.
1191,00:36:57.77,00:36:57.77,"I LOVE YOU, MIKAYLA ABUT I WANT"
1192,00:36:59.80,00:36:59.80,TO KEEP EVERYBODY TO THEIR WORD.
1193,00:37:01.30,00:37:01.30,SO THERE SHOULD BE ONLY ONE VOTE
1194,00:37:03.03,00:37:03.03,BEING VOTED TONIGHT.
1195,00:37:05.43,00:37:05.43,"HALF OF US ARE ON ONE SIDE, HALF"
1196,00:37:08.03,00:37:08.03,OF US ARE ON THE OTHER AND IT
1197,00:37:09.93,00:37:09.93,CONCERNS ME.
1198,00:37:10.63,00:37:10.63,THAT'S NOT LOYALTY.
1199,00:37:11.40,00:37:11.40,THAT'S A HOUSE DIVIDED AND A
1200,00:37:13.10,00:37:13.10,HOUSE DIVIDE--
1201,00:37:13.67,00:37:13.67,THAT'S A DIFFERENCE IN
1202,00:37:15.07,00:37:15.07,"OPINION, THOUGH."
1203,00:37:15.73,00:37:15.73,LOYALTY AND OPINIONS ARE TWO
1204,00:37:17.07,00:37:17.07,SEPARATE IDEAS.
1205,00:37:17.77,00:37:17.77,"WE'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING, MAN."
1206,00:37:19.13,00:37:19.13,WE CANNOT BE DIVIDED AND HAVE
1207,00:37:21.43,00:37:21.43,LOYALTY.
1208,00:37:22.13,00:37:22.13,VOTE ME OUT TODAY IF WE'RE GOING
1209,00:37:24.30,00:37:24.30,"TO PLAY DISLOYAL, BECAUSE MONEY"
1210,00:37:25.63,00:37:25.63,YOU CAN THROW IT IN THAT FIRE
1211,00:37:27.17,00:37:27.17,AND IT'S GONE.
1212,00:37:28.03,00:37:28.03,CHARACTER YOU LIVE WITH FOR THE
1213,00:37:29.30,00:37:29.30,REST OF YOUR LIFE.
1214,00:37:31.50,00:37:31.50,"Jeff: SO, MIKAYLA, IT"
1215,00:37:33.20,00:37:33.20,SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE IN THE
1216,00:37:34.30,00:37:34.30,MIDDLE OF A DIVIDED TRIBE-- AT
1217,00:37:35.83,00:37:35.83,LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
1218,00:37:36.77,00:37:36.77,IS THAT WHAT YOU HEARD?
1219,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"WELL, OBVIOUSLY, BRANDON'S"
1220,00:37:39.20,00:37:39.20,HAD SOMETHING AGAINST ME FROM
1221,00:37:40.33,00:37:40.33,THE BEGINNING--
1222,00:37:41.03,00:37:41.03,BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST YOU YOU
1223,00:37:42.77,00:37:42.77,OR EDNA STRATEGICALLY IN THIS
1224,00:37:44.97,00:37:44.97,GAME.

1227,00:37:48.20,00:37:48.20,BUT BECAUSE I SAID I WOULD NOT
1228,00:37:49.37,00:37:49.37,"VOTE EDNA OUT OF THIS TRIBE, I'M"
1229,00:37:52.03,00:37:52.03,"BOUND TO WHAT I SAID, PERIOD."

1238,00:38:07.00,00:38:07.00,BEFORE THE VOTE.
1239,00:38:07.97,00:38:07.97,THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S A
1240,00:38:10.13,00:38:10.13,POINT OF BEING TOO HONEST AND
1241,00:38:12.00,00:38:12.00,YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THERE
1242,00:38:13.47,00:38:13.47,ARE SOME CARDS THAT NEED TO BE

1245,00:38:19.13,00:38:19.13,BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE
