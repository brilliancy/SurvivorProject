1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.47,00:00:02.47,Survivor... Sandra approached Darrah about making
3,00:00:05.03,00:00:05.03,an all-girl alliance. >> I want the guys to go.
4,00:00:08.43,00:00:08.43,">> Yeah, yeah. >> Burton is a bigger threat"
5,00:00:10.17,00:00:10.17,"than Jon, because Jon is just like a girl."
6,00:00:13.40,00:00:13.40,">> PROBST: At the reward challenge, the Survivors"
7,00:00:15.40,00:00:15.40,competed in teams of three. Sandra took a chinner
8,00:00:18.40,00:00:18.40,"on the platform, and Lill, Darrah and Jon won the reward."
9,00:00:22.27,00:00:22.27,"Lill, Darrah, Jon-- overnight spa reward!"
10,00:00:25.73,00:00:25.73,And they were off on a scenic flight to a luxury spa.
11,00:00:28.97,00:00:28.97,>> This could be the best reward in the history of the game.
12,00:00:31.50,00:00:31.50,>> PROBST: The three enjoyed first-class service.
13,00:00:33.53,00:00:33.53,">> Oh, baby. >> PROBST: And Jon continued to"
14,00:00:35.90,00:00:35.90,play up his dead grandmother lie.
15,00:00:38.20,00:00:38.20,>> And I told them that one of her last wishes was that I win.
16,00:00:41.30,00:00:41.30,">> PROBST: After returning to camp, Lill sought reassurance"
17,00:00:44.67,00:00:44.67,from Burton about their alliance.
18,00:00:47.47,00:00:47.47,>> You're telling me now that you have second thoughts?
19,00:00:50.00,00:00:50.00,>> I have never promised her top two.
20,00:00:52.40,00:00:52.40,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Darrah's steady aim"
21,00:00:54.87,00:00:54.87,won her immunity for the second time in a row.
22,00:00:58.53,00:00:58.53,"Once again, Darrah wins immunity."
23,00:01:01.57,00:01:01.57,"Before Tribal Council, Christa and Sandra believed"
24,00:01:04.37,00:01:04.37,"Lill would be the one to go. >> So, Lill, is it tonight?"
25,00:01:07.60,00:01:07.60,>> I just want to make sure everybody was on the same sheet
26,00:01:10.03,00:01:10.03,"of music. >> PROBST: But, in the end,"
27,00:01:11.73,00:01:11.73,Darrah and Lill joined the guys and voted out Sandra's old ally.
28,00:01:15.23,00:01:15.23,"Christa, the tribe has spoken. Five are left."
29,00:01:20.10,00:01:20.10,Who will be voted out tonight? ( theme music playing )

32,00:02:37.53,00:02:37.53,">> So, before you cuss me out tonight, Sandra, Christa"
33,00:02:41.03,00:02:41.03,"offered you up all day long. She said, as long as you're"
34,00:02:45.20,00:02:45.20,"here, she'll never get to enjoy a reward."
35,00:02:48.30,00:02:48.30,"And you refuse to accept that this is a one-person,"
36,00:02:50.50,00:02:50.50,"not a two-player game. >> Last Tribal Council,"
37,00:02:53.33,00:02:53.33,another blindside. Chalk another one up
38,00:02:56.23,00:02:56.23,for Jon and me. Uh... Christa didn't see it coming.
39,00:02:59.73,00:02:59.73,"Um... just out of nowhere, she was voted out."
40,00:03:03.13,00:03:03.13,Beautiful thing is that's three in a row.
41,00:03:05.57,00:03:05.57,>> So she asked that we switch it from Lill to you all day
42,00:03:08.73,00:03:08.73,"long. >> I guess I can't complain,"
43,00:03:10.70,00:03:10.70,"huh? I got three more days, right?"
44,00:03:13.80,00:03:13.80,>> Sandra's clueless in the fact that she's positive she's going
45,00:03:16.80,00:03:16.80,"next, and it's not true. She's a much weaker competitor"
46,00:03:20.10,00:03:20.10,than D. Sandra probably feels about
47,00:03:22.67,00:03:22.67,"as vulnerable as possible, and, uh..."
48,00:03:24.77,00:03:24.77,I want her to keep feeling that way.
49,00:03:26.07,00:03:26.07,"(thunder roaring) >> Today is day 34 and, um..."
50,00:03:39.53,00:03:39.53,"I'm not feeling too good, because of the fact that"
51,00:03:42.67,00:03:42.67,"now Christa's gone, and I know I'm vulnerable."
52,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,I know my days are numbered. >> I'm just thinking of things
53,00:03:47.87,00:03:47.87,"we need to do-- like, probably boil water, probably get"
54,00:03:50.13,00:03:50.13,"firewood. So, who's going to go get"
55,00:03:52.27,00:03:52.27,mussels with me? >> Lill.
56,00:03:54.33,00:03:54.33,">> Jon, Burton, Lill and Darrah, they all deceived, so"
57,00:03:57.50,00:03:57.50,now I'm working on my revenge. My plan right now is to start on
58,00:04:02.20,00:04:02.20,"the two water cans. I'm going to hide those,"
59,00:04:05.57,00:04:05.57,"I'm going to hide the nets, 'cause they haven't used them"
60,00:04:07.47,00:04:07.47,"in a long time. Lord, give me the strength"
61,00:04:09.50,00:04:09.50,to make it through all of this ...
62,00:04:11.90,00:04:11.90,"I'm going to hide the pickax, all the knives,"
63,00:04:14.97,00:04:14.97,"all the machetes. I mean, little by little, they"
64,00:04:17.70,00:04:17.70,just won't even see it coming. >> See you in ten minutes.
65,00:04:20.70,00:04:20.70,>> I'm going to hide the spear and all four masks.
66,00:04:23.73,00:04:23.73,"Therefore, they don't have a way to fish unless they're going"
67,00:04:26.37,00:04:26.37,to go out there with their bare hands.
68,00:04:28.23,00:04:28.23,"I know I'm going down, but they're going to feel it more"
69,00:04:30.63,00:04:30.63,"than I am. Yes, they are."
70,00:04:38.90,00:04:38.90,">> You guys aren't getting any snails, right?"
71,00:04:40.77,00:04:40.77,"Just, uh, mussels? >> Yep."
72,00:04:42.67,00:04:42.67,"I talked to Lill yesterday about, uh... the possibility"
73,00:04:45.27,00:04:45.27,of going after... getting rid of D next.
74,00:04:48.07,00:04:48.07,">> Yeah. >> And, Lill, what do you think?"
75,00:04:51.90,00:04:51.90,>> I'm not real wild about it. >> But she understood why.
76,00:04:55.53,00:04:55.53,D could win the next immunity challenge.
77,00:04:57.73,00:04:57.73,Then we'd have to decide between ourselves.
78,00:04:59.40,00:04:59.40,">> Jon and Burton said, ""We're going to get rid of"
79,00:05:02.47,00:05:02.47,"Darrah next because she's such a threat."""
80,00:05:04.60,00:05:04.60,"And I thought, ""This is not right."
81,00:05:07.50,00:05:07.50,"I don't like this."" You know, what happened to our"
82,00:05:11.30,00:05:11.30,"alliance of four people? >> You okay, Lill?"
83,00:05:14.57,00:05:14.57,">> Yeah. First, Burton promised me"
84,00:05:17.93,00:05:17.93,number two spot and now he's hem-hawing and saying
85,00:05:21.37,00:05:21.37,"that may not happen. Not only that, they started"
86,00:05:24.50,00:05:24.50,talking about getting rid of Darrah before Sandra.
87,00:05:27.27,00:05:27.27,>> You have no problem with D going out?
88,00:05:28.87,00:05:28.87,">> No, I mean, it's better D than me."
89,00:05:30.63,00:05:30.63,And you two promised me at least third.
90,00:05:33.40,00:05:33.40,>> So everything's cool. >> We made a pact!
91,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,"So I started thinking, ""If they can screw her over,"
92,00:05:38.73,00:05:38.73,"they can screw me over."" >> PROBST: 34 days and we are"
93,00:05:52.80,00:05:52.80,down to five. Congratulations.
94,00:05:55.33,00:05:55.33,>> Thanks. >> Thank you.
95,00:05:56.90,00:05:56.90,>> PROBST: Today's reward challenge is called Second
96,00:05:58.93,00:05:58.93,Chances. You will get a second
97,00:06:00.87,00:06:00.87,chance at some of your favorite challenges.
98,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,You'll begin by being tied up to a post with two pieces of
99,00:06:06.40,00:06:06.40,"rope, one on your hands, one around your ankles."
100,00:06:09.73,00:06:09.73,"Once you're untied, you'll take the two pieces of rope,"
101,00:06:12.40,00:06:12.40,dig under a bamboo fence. You'll then come to a compass.
102,00:06:15.87,00:06:15.87,"Using a map and the two pieces of rope, find the place where"
103,00:06:18.57,00:06:18.57,"the coordinates intersect. Dig down, get a key."
104,00:06:21.23,00:06:21.23,That key lets you into one side of a jail cell.
105,00:06:24.67,00:06:24.67,"Once you're in, you need to get out."
106,00:06:27.30,00:06:27.30,You do this by using sticks and twine to build a pole.
107,00:06:30.00,00:06:30.00,Use the pole to retrieve a second key.
108,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,That will unlock the other side of the jail cell.
109,00:06:34.87,00:06:34.87,You'll then proceed to the firing range.
110,00:06:37.40,00:06:37.40,"Using a slingshot, you will then break three plates."
111,00:06:39.93,00:06:39.93,Attached to each plate is a bag of letter puzzle pieces.
112,00:06:42.70,00:06:42.70,"Once you have all three bags, use the letters to unscramble"
113,00:06:45.40,00:06:45.40,a very famous pirate term. First person to complete the
114,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,pirate term and have it on their board wins reward.
115,00:06:53.60,00:06:53.60,"As you know by now, Panama was once a very rich city--"
116,00:06:57.50,00:06:57.50,gold and silver-- until Morgan came over in 1671
117,00:07:01.30,00:07:01.30,"and decided he wanted it. Took the place, took the money,"
118,00:07:04.27,00:07:04.27,"burned it to the ground, city was never rebuilt."
119,00:07:06.50,00:07:06.50,"The ruins are all that remain. So, the winner will travel"
120,00:07:10.37,00:07:10.37,by boat to Panama City. You will camp out overnight
121,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,"in comfort, among the ruins of old Panama-- Panama Viejo."
122,00:07:18.37,00:07:18.37,"While spending the night in the ruins, you will feast on"
123,00:07:21.03,00:07:21.03,"suckling pig, you'll have roasted potatoes, great dessert."
124,00:07:25.30,00:07:25.30,Worth playing for? >> Absolutely.
125,00:07:27.60,00:07:27.60,">> PROBST: All right, we'll draw numbers for your spot."
126,00:07:29.53,00:07:29.53,"Wait for my ""Go."" For reward."
127,00:07:34.07,00:07:34.07,Survivors ready? Go!
128,00:07:38.43,00:07:38.43,Sandra using her mouth to untie the knot.
129,00:07:41.50,00:07:41.50,So's Burton. Lill already working on her
130,00:07:44.97,00:07:44.97,feet. And Lill's off.
131,00:07:50.73,00:07:50.73,Lill with a big lead. Burton is through the other
132,00:08:07.07,00:08:07.07,side. Lill is through the other side.
133,00:08:09.50,00:08:09.50,Darrah working it. Jon and Sandra still digging.
134,00:08:12.27,00:08:12.27,Darrah is now out through the other side.
135,00:08:14.53,00:08:14.53,"Lill found her coordinates. Using her pieces of rope,"
136,00:08:17.13,00:08:17.13,try and find where they intersect.
137,00:08:19.67,00:08:19.67,You have two coordinates. Use the pieces of rope to help
138,00:08:22.40,00:08:22.40,you find where they intersect. Jon is through.
139,00:08:25.40,00:08:25.40,Sandra is now through. Burton is digging.
140,00:08:27.83,00:08:27.83,Lill is having a hard time. Darrah's found her spot.
141,00:08:31.13,00:08:31.13,She's starting to dig. Burton digging down.
142,00:08:33.80,00:08:33.80,Is he in the right spot? He's not sure.
143,00:08:36.53,00:08:36.53,Lill just going to start digging.
144,00:08:39.90,00:08:39.90,"Doesn't know where the coordinates are, just going"
145,00:08:41.67,00:08:41.67,"to dig. >> All right, all right."
146,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47,Let's think about it. Focus. North.
147,00:08:45.53,00:08:45.53,>> PROBST: Jon has his key and he's through.
148,00:08:48.10,00:08:48.10,"Jon unlocking the jail cell, moving on."
149,00:08:51.27,00:08:51.27,"Lill, you need to slow down and start over."
150,00:08:53.83,00:08:53.83,>> I can't think what I'm doing. North. West...
151,00:08:55.93,00:08:55.93,>> PROBST: Sandra's going to dig in another spot.
152,00:08:58.37,00:08:58.37,Burton's still digging in the same spot.
153,00:09:00.10,00:09:00.10,"Thinks he's in the right spot, and he is-- Burton has his key."
154,00:09:05.97,00:09:05.97,>> Northwest. >> PROBST: Jon at work on his
155,00:09:09.30,00:09:09.30,pole. Sandra has her key.
156,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,Lill has her key. Burton moving quickly
157,00:09:27.23,00:09:27.23,"on his pole. >> Slow down, Lill, slow down."
158,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,"Focus. Focus. Come on, old girl. Focus."
159,00:09:37.10,00:09:37.10,>> PROBST: Darrah has her key. She's in the game.
160,00:09:46.13,00:09:46.13,"Jon's still working on his pole, wants to make sure it's long"
161,00:09:49.13,00:09:49.13,enough. Burton has his key.
162,00:10:00.60,00:10:00.60,"Burton has his key in the cage, going to unlock himself,"
163,00:10:03.73,00:10:03.73,let himself out of the cell. Burton is the first one out.
164,00:10:06.80,00:10:06.80,Goes to work on his slingshot. Burton breaks his first plate.
165,00:10:15.37,00:10:15.37,Jon six inches short. Lill going to give her pole
166,00:10:21.27,00:10:21.27,a shot. Burton has all three plates.
167,00:10:26.57,00:10:26.57,Burton starting to work on his letter pieces.
168,00:10:29.73,00:10:29.73,"Burton has his first pieces open, dumps them on the ground"
169,00:10:32.87,00:10:32.87,for letters. Lill very close.
170,00:10:36.83,00:10:36.83,"A lot of bend, it doesn't look strong enough."
171,00:10:55.50,00:10:55.50,">> Got it. >> PROBST: Say it, Burton."
172,00:10:58.87,00:10:58.87,">> ""Jolly Roger."" >> PROBST: Burton wins reward."
173,00:11:01.73,00:11:01.73,"Nice job. Burton, come on over."
174,00:11:13.93,00:11:13.93,"Well, it wouldn't be much of a memory if you had to do it"
175,00:11:16.73,00:11:16.73,alone. >> Yep.
176,00:11:18.17,00:11:18.17,It's an overnight feast. Who do you want to bring
177,00:11:20.03,00:11:20.03,with you? >> I'm going to take Jon.
178,00:11:21.77,00:11:21.77,">> PROBST: Jon, come on over. >> You're getting a big hug,"
179,00:11:23.57,00:11:23.57,"baby! >> Going into the reward,"
180,00:11:44.27,00:11:44.27,"I had talked to Jon that if I went, I'm gonna take him and"
181,00:11:47.10,00:11:47.10,"vice versa. 'Cause, honestly, we've been"
182,00:11:49.13,00:11:49.13,going on these rewards with people that we don't like
183,00:11:51.70,00:11:51.70,"that much. So, I was looking forward"
184,00:11:53.93,00:11:53.93,to going on a reward with someone it'd be fun with.
185,00:11:56.80,00:11:56.80,">> Wow, that is awesome. >> There, there."
186,00:12:00.47,00:12:00.47,"There, there. >> Oh, this is so awesome."
187,00:12:03.87,00:12:03.87,Do you see how close we are? It was cool that Burton picked
188,00:12:06.97,00:12:06.97,me to share along the experience.
189,00:12:09.53,00:12:09.53,And it was the first time in the game in which Burton and I
190,00:12:12.40,00:12:12.40,"felt as though we could both step away from camp,"
191,00:12:15.63,00:12:15.63,"strategically, and not overly worry."
192,00:12:32.57,00:12:32.57,">> PROBST: Thanks for the ride, guys."
193,00:12:35.00,00:12:35.00,>> We finally get to Panama City and we're walking up
194,00:12:38.30,00:12:38.30,"the boat ramp and I see in a parking lot all by itself,"
195,00:12:41.90,00:12:41.90,"brand spanking new, a GMC Envoy SUV."
196,00:12:45.37,00:12:45.37,>> PROBST: Let's catch ourselves a ride...
197,00:12:48.93,00:12:48.93,"unless, of course, you're digging that ride."
198,00:12:50.93,00:12:50.93,">> Yeah. >> Oh, yeah."
199,00:12:52.93,00:12:52.93,>> PROBST: I happen to have the keys.
200,00:12:54.93,00:12:54.93,"They now belong to you. >> Oh, well, congratulations!"
201,00:12:56.93,00:12:56.93,>> Right on. Let's check it out. Come on.
202,00:12:59.43,00:12:59.43,"Jeff pulled out the keys, and sure enough, the brand-new"
203,00:13:01.90,00:13:01.90,"Envoy is, uh, my new vehicle. (laughs)"
204,00:13:06.50,00:13:06.50,">> Congratulations, man! Congratulations!"
205,00:13:09.53,00:13:09.53,">> PROBST: It's a kind of a combination SUV, truck, car."
206,00:13:12.10,00:13:12.10,>> Right. >> PROBST: A couple of cool
207,00:13:13.70,00:13:13.70,features. Come back here. This comes with the car.
208,00:13:16.13,00:13:16.13,"It's full-on camping gear. Set this up, it becomes"
209,00:13:18.60,00:13:18.60,"a camper. >> It's an awesome prize, and"
210,00:13:21.00,00:13:21.00,"I love camping, snowboarding and skiing."
211,00:13:23.53,00:13:23.53,So the four-wheel drive and everything is... it's awesome.
212,00:13:25.93,00:13:25.93,">> PROBST: So, there's a map inside."
213,00:13:27.87,00:13:27.87,It will lead you to the ruins. I think you'll know 'em when
214,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,you see 'em. Food awaits.
215,00:13:32.27,00:13:32.27,"Have a good time, guys. >> 30-plus days ago,"
216,00:13:35.40,00:13:35.40,I would have been pissed off if anyone had won it but me.
217,00:13:38.43,00:13:38.43,"But, uh, at this point in the game, uh, seeing what Burton's"
218,00:13:41.57,00:13:41.57,"done for the tribe and for me personally, and what he has"
219,00:13:44.90,00:13:44.90,"done challenge-wise, he deserved the car more than anyone else."
220,00:13:48.27,00:13:48.27,And it's kind of a cool feeling knowing I can say that
221,00:13:51.13,00:13:51.13,"and actually mean it. Win, lose or draw, you're"
222,00:13:54.03,00:13:54.03,the only person that I like in this game.
223,00:14:01.60,00:14:01.60,"Are you loving it? >> Dude, I can't believe it."
224,00:14:05.27,00:14:05.27,This is amazing. We drove through downtown
225,00:14:13.77,00:14:13.77,"Panama City, and as we're getting closer, you could see a"
226,00:14:16.80,00:14:16.80,large tower that's still standing.
227,00:14:19.10,00:14:19.10,"And then, when you actually get in there, there's quite"
228,00:14:21.37,00:14:21.37,a bit of the city left from a structural standpoint--
229,00:14:24.20,00:14:24.20,all the old stone walls and structures.
230,00:14:30.70,00:14:30.70,"So we pulled into the ruins, and our feast was set up"
231,00:14:34.53,00:14:34.53,under this tent and our jaws just hit the ground.
232,00:14:38.37,00:14:38.37,"Oh, my Lord. >> Beans, apple sauce, rice,"
233,00:14:41.70,00:14:41.70,fruit... >> Mm-hmm.
234,00:14:43.07,00:14:43.07,">> Dude, marshmallows. >> Wow."
235,00:14:45.37,00:14:45.37,>> I'm gonna start eating. >> There's just food everywhere
236,00:14:48.30,00:14:48.30,"and we started eating everything, basically, at the"
237,00:14:51.67,00:14:51.67,same time. We're going to be eating for
238,00:14:53.73,00:14:53.73,"about five hours. >> Oh, my God."
239,00:14:55.63,00:14:55.63,">> There was no first course, second course and dessert,"
240,00:14:58.47,00:14:58.47,it was just anything goes. Oh!
241,00:15:02.07,00:15:02.07,"Your face, dude. Good meal and good company."
242,00:15:06.00,00:15:06.00,">> Mm-hmm, finally. >> To the girls eating mussels."
243,00:15:08.93,00:15:08.93,>> To the girls eating mussels. (Burton chuckling)
244,00:15:12.33,00:15:12.33,">> Jon and I were kind of laughing because the girls,"
245,00:15:14.97,00:15:14.97,"all they had were mussels that Jon, Lill and I collected."
246,00:15:18.10,00:15:18.10,And they're not going to catch any fish.
247,00:15:20.50,00:15:20.50,"I mean, honestly, those three girls have all been riding"
248,00:15:24.20,00:15:24.20,coattails the entire time they've been out here.
249,00:15:27.20,00:15:27.20,(birds screeching) >> You don't know what those
250,00:15:35.63,00:15:35.63,boys are cooking up. You don't know what they're
251,00:15:38.03,00:15:38.03,saying. You don't know what they've
252,00:15:40.70,00:15:40.70,"promised all of us. >> Yeah, I know."
253,00:15:43.33,00:15:43.33,They promise everyone something different.
254,00:15:44.93,00:15:44.93,>> Mm-hmm. >> Until it comes down
255,00:15:46.87,00:15:46.87,to the very wire. >> Yep.
256,00:15:49.07,00:15:49.07,">> When we got back from the reward today, Lill said that"
257,00:15:51.30,00:15:51.30,"she was kind of scared, um, about trusting the guys."
258,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,"That's why I tell you, don't listen to anything Jon says."
259,00:15:57.50,00:15:57.50,">> Jon screwed me once, twice, Jon will screw me again."
260,00:16:00.57,00:16:00.57,"He slapped me in the face once, he slapped me in the face twice,"
261,00:16:03.03,00:16:03.03,he won't slap me... I have always said that they
262,00:16:05.57,00:16:05.57,were both snakes and I have always said that they're good
263,00:16:07.87,00:16:07.87,"liars. So, everything that Lill was"
264,00:16:10.07,00:16:10.07,saying is stuff that I had already mentioned from before.
265,00:16:12.90,00:16:12.90,">> Well, let me tell you something, little one."
266,00:16:15.03,00:16:15.03,They're ready to get rid of you.
267,00:16:17.00,00:16:17.00,">> I know, that's why I want to win immunity."
268,00:16:18.57,00:16:18.57,>> They're ready to get rid of you before Sandra.
269,00:16:20.40,00:16:20.40,"I wasn't going to tell you that, but I was fighting for you."
270,00:16:23.67,00:16:23.67,"And I said, ""This is not right. It should be Sandra."""
271,00:16:26.73,00:16:26.73,I couldn't lie anymore. I had to tell Darrah.
272,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33,And it pissed me off that these two boys were so easy
273,00:16:32.13,00:16:32.13,"to break their alliance. >> Well, I think that we"
274,00:16:36.73,00:16:36.73,"should get rid of the boys. >> All you got to say to me,"
275,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,"""Sandra, whichever one of the guys doesn't have immunity,"
276,00:16:45.47,00:16:45.47,"that's who's going home."" You don't even have to whisper"
277,00:16:47.97,00:16:47.97,and take me in the bushes and talk to me for two hours.
278,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,">> We... wait a minute. The whole funny thing here is,"
279,00:16:53.20,00:16:53.20,"no matter what, I may, uh, still only come in third."
280,00:16:57.20,00:16:57.20,>> But we all have a fair chance.
281,00:16:59.03,00:16:59.03,>> But at least your chances are better.
282,00:17:00.93,00:17:00.93,>> Neither one of you... you've already told me
283,00:17:02.53,00:17:02.53,you don't want to go up in front of a jury with me.
284,00:17:04.27,00:17:04.27,">> But if you were standing there, Lill, you'd get"
285,00:17:06.13,00:17:06.13,my million-dollar vote. >> Only if you're on the jury.
286,00:17:08.47,00:17:08.47,>> Lill doesn't seem to understand.
287,00:17:11.00,00:17:11.00,"She keeps thinking that, regardless, she's done at three."
288,00:17:14.23,00:17:14.23,"And I tell her, I'm not  stronger than you, Lill."
289,00:17:16.63,00:17:16.63,Have I ever showed you that I  was stronger than you in all
290,00:17:18.63,00:17:18.63,these competitions? You're not bad for 50 years old.
291,00:17:21.20,00:17:21.20,"So, if you're with them, you're going to get third."
292,00:17:23.70,00:17:23.70,"But being against us, you have a chance to move up on your own."
293,00:17:26.53,00:17:26.53,>> The only way you're going to have a chance at one and two
294,00:17:29.13,00:17:29.13,is with us three. Jon's going to take Burton.
295,00:17:32.53,00:17:32.53,Burton's going to take Jon. >> Let's see who does
296,00:17:35.90,00:17:35.90,"immunity tomorrow, guys. 'Cause I think we need to get..."
297,00:17:38.80,00:17:38.80,think about Burton first. >> Because he's the strongest?
298,00:17:42.00,00:17:42.00,">> So, if Burton wins immunity, Jon's gone, right?"
299,00:17:47.70,00:17:47.70,>> Right. >> If one of us three win
300,00:17:49.87,00:17:49.87,"immunity, Burton's gone. >> I am totally psyched."
301,00:17:52.70,00:17:52.70,I am very happy knowing that there's still a chance.
302,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,The only problem now is that I had so many plans of sabotage
303,00:18:00.73,00:18:00.73,"that now I have to hold off, because I think it's in my"
304,00:18:03.93,00:18:03.93,best interest not to  start commotion.
305,00:18:06.73,00:18:06.73,"I'd be happy with third. >> Heck, yeah."
306,00:18:09.43,00:18:09.43,"I would be, too. >> All right, let's..."
307,00:18:11.13,00:18:11.13,let's do this. Let's see who gets
308,00:18:13.10,00:18:13.10,immunity tomorrow. >> They're going home.
309,00:18:14.80,00:18:14.80,It's going to be us three girls in the end.
310,00:18:21.37,00:18:21.37,>> Are we worried about the girls strategizing
311,00:18:24.10,00:18:24.10,"against us? >> No, 'cause I think that..."
312,00:18:26.07,00:18:26.07,>> I feel like we're pretty confident in our abilities...
313,00:18:27.90,00:18:27.90,">> Yeah, I think we can squash their plans pretty quickly."
314,00:18:29.87,00:18:29.87,">> Yeah. I... >> I mean, not one of them has"
315,00:18:31.50,00:18:31.50,had a strategy yet in this game. >> Yeah.
316,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,>> I don't know why it'd start now.
317,00:18:35.20,00:18:35.20,">> Yeah, exactly. Burton and I basically"
318,00:18:36.73,00:18:36.73,just went over the fact that the three girls
319,00:18:38.67,00:18:38.67,were probably discussing a girls-versus-guys plan
320,00:18:40.53,00:18:40.53,while we're gone. But it only takes one person
321,00:18:42.70,00:18:42.70,"to swing the vote. So, figure we had"
322,00:18:45.03,00:18:45.03,a one-out-of-three chance of pulling one of them back.
323,00:18:47.60,00:18:47.60,And we feel that we definitely have an intellectual advantage
324,00:18:49.80,00:18:49.80,over the others. >> Good to go.
325,00:18:51.80,00:18:51.80,"Hey, hey. Dude, this thing's pretty sweet."
326,00:18:54.77,00:18:54.77,"Jon and I were just kind of shooting the breeze,"
327,00:18:58.00,00:18:58.00,talking about not talking about the car when we got back to
328,00:19:00.53,00:19:00.53,"camp, because it is something that someone might hold against"
329,00:19:04.13,00:19:04.13,me. I think we should be able to get
330,00:19:06.67,00:19:06.67,"back and smooth everything over. We literally need to be like,"
331,00:19:09.33,00:19:09.33,"""Lill, ""we've gotten you this far."""
332,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,"Like, ""Don't mess it up."" We were talking about"
333,00:19:14.73,00:19:14.73,"who we trusted, who we didn't. We had told Lill that we were"
334,00:19:17.73,00:19:17.73,going to vote Darrah out next and she wasn't comfortable
335,00:19:20.70,00:19:20.70,with it. So I don't know if I can trust
336,00:19:22.83,00:19:22.83,anything she says to me here on out.
337,00:19:24.93,00:19:24.93,I think we approach Sandra just as a backup.
338,00:19:28.13,00:19:28.13,">> Yeah. >> Be like, ""Hey, Sandra..."""
339,00:19:30.80,00:19:30.80,">> ""Final Three."" >> ""Final Three..."""
340,00:19:33.50,00:19:33.50,">> She doesn't trust us at all, but you know what,"
341,00:19:36.17,00:19:36.17,I bet she would again. How many times have I dogged
342,00:19:38.70,00:19:38.70,"that girl out? >> To be honest, Jon and I"
343,00:19:41.73,00:19:41.73,have been running the show for the last 20 days nearly.
344,00:19:45.13,00:19:45.13,"And those three girls, I don't think they could come"
345,00:19:48.07,00:19:48.07,up with a decent strategy if they had to.
346,00:19:49.90,00:19:49.90,>> We have played everything about as perfectly as it
347,00:19:53.83,00:19:53.83,can be played in this game. >> A lot of people are about
348,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,"to get run over by the bus, but you and I are good."
349,00:20:00.57,00:20:00.57,>> Exactly. (Jon laughing)
350,00:20:28.57,00:20:28.57,>> I don't know why God's putting me through this.
351,00:20:33.40,00:20:33.40,"I just can't sleep, guys, and it hurts."
352,00:20:35.47,00:20:35.47,>> You can take it for four days.
353,00:20:37.57,00:20:37.57,You will have to take it for four days.
354,00:20:40.27,00:20:40.27,>> You going to have to. >> You going to have to take it
355,00:20:42.67,00:20:42.67,for four days. >> It's going to drag you along.
356,00:20:44.87,00:20:44.87,">> I can't sleep because, you know, my arms and my legs"
357,00:20:49.00,00:20:49.00,are on fire. I'm just...
358,00:20:51.70,00:20:51.70,I just feel numb this morning. I'm just...
359,00:20:54.60,00:20:54.60,"I don't know if it's menopause. I don't know what it is,"
360,00:20:58.17,00:20:58.17,"but it's hurting me. >> I think, yeah..."
361,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,I think you're stressing now. >> If I could just get some
362,00:21:04.13,00:21:04.13,rest. >> You have to think positive.
363,00:21:07.13,00:21:07.13,">> Yeah, but, see, if I could just rest in my mind."
364,00:21:10.13,00:21:10.13,My mind is just not rested. >> Are you thinking about
365,00:21:13.60,00:21:13.60,Burton? Is that why you're so stressed?
366,00:21:15.40,00:21:15.40,Is that one of the primary reasons?
367,00:21:17.70,00:21:17.70,"I'm worried that he's going to get immunity and Jon goes,"
368,00:21:20.73,00:21:20.73,and then he's going to attack. (sighs)
369,00:21:33.30,00:21:33.30,>> You think Lill's getting nervous?
370,00:21:35.43,00:21:35.43,>> She stresses out about every little thing.
371,00:21:39.97,00:21:39.97,">> I would hate for today to be one of those relaxed days,"
372,00:21:43.23,00:21:43.23,'cause we need to get Burton out of here as soon as possible.
373,00:21:45.50,00:21:45.50,>> Mm-hmm. >> 'Cause one whole day is
374,00:21:47.90,00:21:47.90,enough time to turn anybody's head around.
375,00:21:52.53,00:21:52.53,That's not good. >> Uh-uh.
376,00:21:55.10,00:21:55.10,">> When Burton and Jon come back, I'm going to do what I"
377,00:21:57.17,00:21:57.17,usually do whenever they betray me-- be the outcast until Jon

379,00:22:03.77,00:22:03.77,"I swear, you won't be the next to go, as long as you vote"
380,00:22:06.27,00:22:06.27,"this person out."" ""Okay, Jon."
381,00:22:08.40,00:22:08.40,"If that'll save my skin again, then I shall do that."""
382,00:22:11.23,00:22:11.23,"We already made our pact. I'll say ""yes"" to whatever he"
383,00:22:13.60,00:22:13.60,"says, and I'll come back and let you know."
384,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97,I won't betray. The sooner we get rid of these
385,00:22:18.97,00:22:18.97,"jackasses, the better. I can't worry about what"
386,00:22:21.97,00:22:21.97,Lill's going to do. If every minute I'm looking over
387,00:22:24.03,00:22:24.03,"my shoulder like, ""What in the hell is Lill doing?"""
388,00:22:25.90,00:22:25.90,They're going to know something's up.
389,00:22:27.63,00:22:27.63,"That's usually Burton's job, to keep control of everybody"
390,00:22:29.80,00:22:29.80,"and figure out where everyone's at-- who's with who, who's not"
391,00:22:31.93,00:22:31.93,"with who, who's peeing, who's cooking..."
392,00:22:34.47,00:22:34.47,"No, I'm going to lay there and, hopefully, try to take a"
393,00:22:37.23,00:22:37.23,nap and just relax. When I see them sitting up on
394,00:22:40.00,00:22:40.00,"the beach, I'm just going to lay down..."
395,00:22:42.63,00:22:42.63,and put on my game face. >> Sounds good.
396,00:23:09.10,00:23:09.10,>> Hell or high water. I'm not changing my mind.
397,00:23:22.10,00:23:22.10,"I hope you guys have hangovers. >> Yeah, that's the one"
398,00:23:27.13,00:23:27.13,thing you do have. >> All regrets...
399,00:23:29.33,00:23:29.33,and hangovers a little bit. >> I'll tell you what...
400,00:23:31.67,00:23:31.67,"When Jon and I got off the boat, Lill and Darrah met us."
401,00:23:34.67,00:23:34.67,"Like, ""Hey, how's it going?"" We told them what we were..."
402,00:23:37.40,00:23:37.40,"how our thing was. And we're like, ""So, how'd"
403,00:23:39.57,00:23:39.57,"everything go here?"" And they immediately started"
404,00:23:41.40,00:23:41.40,"bashing Sandra. She's ready to go,"
405,00:23:43.37,00:23:43.37,"she wants to be gone, and that's how she's acting."
406,00:23:45.70,00:23:45.70,It's like... >> She went by herself and
407,00:23:47.50,00:23:47.50,we were off by ourselves. >> She hasn't tried to
408,00:23:49.37,00:23:49.37,strategize? >> No.
409,00:23:50.93,00:23:50.93,>> No. >> We were taking a bath.
410,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,"She wouldn't even come by us. >> Well, she had to have said,"
411,00:23:54.33,00:23:54.33,"""Let's vote Burton out or Jon out."""
412,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,">> No, she didn't. She just said, ""I'm done."""
413,00:23:57.90,00:23:57.90,>> She really has not talked to us at all.
414,00:23:59.60,00:23:59.60,>> She's so mad. >> Wow.
415,00:24:01.00,00:24:01.00,">> Like, we ask her something, she answers us and that's it."
416,00:24:02.87,00:24:02.87,It's like she just cuts us short.
417,00:24:07.13,00:24:07.13,">> Sandra D., how are you doing? What's wrong?"
418,00:24:15.07,00:24:15.07,>> Nothing. >> You all right?
419,00:24:23.80,00:24:23.80,>> I'm good. >> All right.
420,00:24:26.00,00:24:26.00,All good in the hood? >> All good in the hood.
421,00:24:29.67,00:24:29.67,The girls seem to be putting up quite an act.
422,00:24:32.53,00:24:32.53,"Lill and Darrah came up, ""Sandra's not talking to us."
423,00:24:35.67,00:24:35.67,"Sandra hasn't done anything."" Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
424,00:24:37.43,00:24:37.43,Sandra's in bed pouting and puffing.
425,00:24:41.43,00:24:41.43,>> Why should I do anything if I'm thinking I'm going home?
426,00:24:43.83,00:24:43.83,"Why should I lift a finger? >> So, you want to go home?"
427,00:24:45.77,00:24:45.77,>> Why...? No. Why should I go get water if I'm
428,00:24:47.83,00:24:47.83,going to get bit by the mosquitoes?
429,00:24:49.63,00:24:49.63,">> Guys, I got to put my feet in the water."
430,00:24:51.47,00:24:51.47,"I'll be back. >> Hey, D?"
431,00:24:55.07,00:24:55.07,">> Yeah. >> Come on, walk with me."
432,00:24:57.70,00:24:57.70,>> Still not exactly buying what the girls are selling.
433,00:25:00.37,00:25:00.37,"I don't know if I can trust them, but I know, given"
434,00:25:03.10,00:25:03.10,"enough time, we're going to catch them in some lies."
435,00:25:05.63,00:25:05.63,"'Cause, one, none of them are good liars and, two, none of"
436,00:25:08.37,00:25:08.37,"them have any good strategies. So, we need to put some"
437,00:25:11.87,00:25:11.87,pressure on them and figure out what's going on.
438,00:25:15.10,00:25:15.10,"Well, what are you... what are you thinking"
439,00:25:17.07,00:25:17.07,at this point in the game? >> I don't know.
440,00:25:21.13,00:25:21.13,>> I can't believe you three didn't try to figure out
441,00:25:24.33,00:25:24.33,a girl alliance to go against Jon and me.
442,00:25:27.23,00:25:27.23,">> Sandra is ready to leave. >> Yeah, but Sandra's also"

453,00:25:59.27,00:25:59.27,Are you aware of that? 'Cause they won't turn
454,00:26:01.93,00:26:01.93,"on each other. >> Talk to me in English, Jon."
455,00:26:04.80,00:26:04.80,>> Talk to you in English? Okay.

469,00:26:40.07,00:26:40.07,"If D wins immunity, it's Lill. Do we... I mean, I need you to"

563,00:32:34.87,00:32:34.87,you have immunity. You are safe at the next
564,00:32:36.63,00:32:36.63,"Tribal Council. Sandra, Lill, Jon and Burton,"
565,00:32:40.37,00:32:40.37,one of the four of you is going home.
566,00:32:42.87,00:32:42.87,"Immunity right up there. Swim over, grab it."
567,00:32:46.60,00:32:46.60,You guys can head back into camp.
568,00:33:19.03,00:33:19.03,">> Uh, D won for the third time in a row."
569,00:33:22.47,00:33:22.47,"Uh, Lill is now next to go as a result."
570,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,"And, you know, I feel kind of bad about that,"
571,00:33:27.23,00:33:27.23,"but Lill has, uh, physically and emotionally"
572,00:33:29.77,00:33:29.77,just broken down at this point. Lill has not talked with us
573,00:33:32.90,00:33:32.90,"like she usually does. Uh, Lill has, uh, not done"
574,00:33:36.37,00:33:36.37,the work that she... that she usually does.
575,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,"And, uh, that's a different Lill."
576,00:33:41.30,00:33:41.30,And her actions are telling me that I can't trust her
577,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,"right now. What's the word, T-bird?"
578,00:33:46.03,00:33:46.03,>> I just gave Burton my full report.
579,00:33:49.00,00:33:49.00,Go ask Burton. I'm not feeling well.
580,00:33:53.10,00:33:53.10,I'm not sleeping. I hurt like hell.
581,00:33:55.97,00:33:55.97,"So please, you two, stop playing tag team"
582,00:33:59.07,00:33:59.07,"on me, please. >> We're not playing tag team."
583,00:34:01.40,00:34:01.40,I was just asking how you're doing.
584,00:34:03.60,00:34:03.60,">> Oh. I'm okay. >> No, no, no."
585,00:34:19.03,00:34:19.03,">> Mm-hmm. >> Lill is, Lill is a basket"
586,00:34:24.87,00:34:24.87,case right now. >> I know.
587,00:34:26.23,00:34:26.23,>> Her body is shutting off. She sleeps an hour a night.
588,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,She's freaking out. She's a disaster.
589,00:34:31.60,00:34:31.60,"If, if no other reason, that's why we got"
590,00:34:33.97,00:34:33.97,to get rid of her. Lill's acting weird.
591,00:34:35.70,00:34:35.70,She's on her last legs. She's just not doing well.
592,00:34:38.30,00:34:38.30,And she's developing a pretty tight relationship with Darrah
593,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57,"that's making me nervous. Um, but the way Jon and I"
594,00:34:43.77,00:34:43.77,"are seeing it, if we can get Sandra to vote"
595,00:34:47.10,00:34:47.10,"with us to get Lill off, um, I think"
596,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,it'll be a pretty good move. >> This is not good for
597,00:34:52.03,00:34:52.03,business. >> What?
598,00:34:53.30,00:34:53.30,>> This chick winning everything.
599,00:34:55.57,00:34:55.57,">> No. So, here's the deal."
600,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"Lill told me that you three had talked about,"
601,00:35:00.07,00:35:00.07,"like, a girls' alliance. >> She must be making that up,"
602,00:35:02.43,00:35:02.43,'cause I'm not going with Lill anyway.
603,00:35:04.27,00:35:04.27,I know how much... how she feels about me.
604,00:35:06.17,00:35:06.17,"She... they whisper about me. I know they do,"
605,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,regardless of this grandma niceness that she portrays.
606,00:35:11.57,00:35:11.57,>> What about Darrah? Same thing?
607,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,>> Darrah don't even talk to me. You know what I'm saying?
608,00:35:15.57,00:35:15.57,">> Well, you two should... >> We don't, we haven't even "
609,00:35:17.53,00:35:17.53,been talking about chocolate  chips which is something
610,00:35:19.37,00:35:19.37,that we always talk about. >> Yeah.
611,00:35:21.10,00:35:21.10,">> So I wouldn't worry if I were you,"
612,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,'cause I'm a write Lill's name down big as ...
613,00:35:26.37,00:35:26.37,"If that's what's going to save me, then so be it."
614,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,">> Uh, I've really never spoken strategy with Sandra."
615,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,"The good thing about her, though, is she'd vote out her"
616,00:35:34.47,00:35:34.47,"best friend, her worst enemy. She would go to the next level"
617,00:35:37.10,00:35:37.10,with five people she hated to get to that next level.
618,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"So, it's very cut and dry with Sandra."
619,00:35:42.83,00:35:42.83,"There's no, ""Oh, I have feelings for this person"""
620,00:35:45.43,00:35:45.43,"or ""I don't know if we should do that."""
621,00:35:47.07,00:35:47.07,"She doesn't care. She goes, ""If I'm staying in"
622,00:35:48.93,00:35:48.93,"the game, I'll vote for them."" >> That's a good fire, right"
623,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17,there. >> Mm-hmm.
624,00:35:57.57,00:35:57.57,">> No, no, no. >> Leave her something."
625,00:35:59.27,00:35:59.27,">> We're definitely going to leave her food, but we're all"
626,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,"100% in agreement for, um, Lill? >> Yeah."
627,00:36:06.03,00:36:06.03,">> And, and it's the smartest thing for all of us to do"
628,00:36:08.23,00:36:08.23,because... >> Absolutely. We all agree.
629,00:36:09.97,00:36:09.97,">> With her in the game, if someone ends up against her,"
630,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,they're not going to win. >> Right.
631,00:36:13.67,00:36:13.67,>> All right. >> All three girls are as dumb.
632,00:36:15.57,00:36:15.57,There's no... they share a brain...
633,00:36:18.03,00:36:18.03,"I don't even think they share a whole brain, or obviously they"
634,00:36:20.10,00:36:20.10,"would figure out, ""Hey, we can get rid of these guys."""
635,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,"They're foolish. I mean, uh, the girls"
636,00:36:24.53,00:36:24.53,"in this game have... have done nothing to, uh,"
637,00:36:27.30,00:36:27.30,nothing for women's rights or anything like that.
638,00:36:29.87,00:36:29.87,"I mean, like, uh, they'd be better off, you know,"
639,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,"scrubbing potatoes and mopping floors, uh, to... to get bills"
640,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,"passed at this point. Uh, they, they've shown"
641,00:36:37.73,00:36:37.73,they're nothing more than followers in this game.
642,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,I think it's downright foolish that they didn't talk.
643,00:36:42.63,00:36:42.63,"But, uh, I felt, and will continue to feel that I'm much"
644,00:36:45.70,00:36:45.70,"smarter than them anyways. So, I guess, uh,"
645,00:36:48.43,00:36:48.43,kind of par for the course. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
646,00:37:05.07,00:37:05.07,"the members of our jury: Ryno, Rupert, T, and Christa,"
647,00:37:10.40,00:37:10.40,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
648,00:37:15.73,00:37:15.73,"36 days you've been out here. Darrah, how are you"
649,00:37:19.97,00:37:19.97,"holding up? >> Um, I'm holding up pretty"
650,00:37:22.03,00:37:22.03,"good, besides losing all the weight."
651,00:37:24.37,00:37:24.37,">> PROBST: Although, that worked to your advantage yesterday."
652,00:37:26.80,00:37:26.80,">> Yeah. Yeah, majorly, for having small hands."
653,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,"But, um, I don't have as much energy to do, really, anything."
654,00:37:33.30,00:37:33.30,"This morning, getting firewood just, like, killed me, but,"
655,00:37:36.50,00:37:36.50,um... >> We don't even talk.
656,00:37:38.23,00:37:38.23,>> PROBST: What's that? >> We don't even talk.
657,00:37:40.80,00:37:40.80,>> PROBST: It's too much energy. >> Yeah.
658,00:37:42.97,00:37:42.97,You don't even want to open your mouth.
659,00:37:45.10,00:37:45.10,">> PROBST: Jon, you've got to be a little impressed that, of"
660,00:37:47.73,00:37:47.73,"the five people left, three are women."
661,00:37:50.83,00:37:50.83,">> Lill is the strongest person here, easily."
662,00:37:53.37,00:37:53.37,"I mean, she works harder than everyone else."
663,00:37:55.93,00:37:55.93,Sandra is as tough as every single one of us.
664,00:37:58.70,00:37:58.70,"And D, three immunities in a row."
665,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,There's not a guy here that can say that.
666,00:38:03.20,00:38:03.20,"So, I'm very impressed with these women, in that aspect."
667,00:38:05.40,00:38:05.40,">> PROBST: Lill, did you honestly expect you would be "
668,00:38:08.00,00:38:08.00,"here 36 days in? >> Truthfully, between"
669,00:38:11.67,00:38:11.67,"you, me and God, no. I never thought I would make it"
670,00:38:16.27,00:38:16.27,this far. I've done some tough things in
671,00:38:19.20,00:38:19.20,"my life, but nothing like this. I just need the strength"
672,00:38:22.73,00:38:22.73,to go on for another three days or however long my tribe
673,00:38:26.47,00:38:26.47,will keep me here. >> PROBST: Jon...
674,00:38:29.20,00:38:29.20,how you feeling tonight? >> Tribal Councils scare
675,00:38:31.40,00:38:31.40,"the crap out of me, man. I don't like them."
676,00:38:34.00,00:38:34.00,I don't like them at all. This has turned into
677,00:38:36.30,00:38:36.30,surprise Tribal Council every time.
678,00:38:38.63,00:38:38.63,"So, uh, I don't want to be on the other end of a surprise."
679,00:38:41.73,00:38:41.73,">> PROBST: Burton, do you feel badly at all when"
680,00:38:44.83,00:38:44.83,you send somebody out of here who had no idea it was coming?
681,00:38:48.40,00:38:48.40,>> I feel awful when people get blindsided.
682,00:38:51.77,00:38:51.77,I was somewhat blindsided when I got voted out.
683,00:38:54.90,00:38:54.90,And it's something that I don't wish to do on anybody.
684,00:38:58.50,00:38:58.50,"But, I mean, a lot of times you do it and it's the only way"
685,00:39:01.47,00:39:01.47,you can guarantee that somehow it doesn't get reversed around
686,00:39:04.27,00:39:04.27,"and you get blindsided. So, it, it's"
687,00:39:07.47,00:39:07.47,"a double-edged sword. >> PROBST: Darrah, for the third"
688,00:39:09.87,00:39:09.87,"time, you have immunity. I'm not sensing you want"
689,00:39:12.23,00:39:12.23,to give it up. >> No.
690,00:39:13.97,00:39:13.97,>> PROBST: All right. Darrah is the only
691,00:39:15.73,00:39:15.73,one you cannot vote for. It is time to find out which way
692,00:39:18.50,00:39:18.50,that sword will cut tonight. It's time to vote.
693,00:39:21.43,00:39:21.43,"Burton, you're up. >> Lill, you're not someone I'd"
694,00:39:34.37,00:39:34.37,"want to go up against in the Final Two, so your time has"
695,00:39:37.00,00:39:37.00,come. >> I'm hardcore. I'm hardcore.
696,00:39:52.53,00:39:52.53,I'm hardcore. And you're nice. Have a nice day.
697,00:40:10.23,00:40:10.23,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
698,00:40:22.53,00:40:22.53,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
699,00:40:25.43,00:40:25.43,The person voted out will be asked to leave
700,00:40:27.43,00:40:27.43,the Tribal Council area immediately.
701,00:40:29.40,00:40:29.40,I'll read the votes. First vote:
702,00:40:35.07,00:40:35.07,"""Lill."" ""Lill."""
703,00:40:42.10,00:40:42.10,"Two votes Lill. ""Burton."""

706,00:40:58.90,00:40:58.90,"two votes, Burton. 12th person voted out"
707,00:41:03.80,00:41:03.80,"of the tribe... ""Burton."""
708,00:41:09.83,00:41:09.83,"Bring me your torch. Burton, for the second time"
709,00:41:18.37,00:41:18.37,the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go.
710,00:41:34.23,00:41:34.23,"Well, another surprise vote. I got to hand it to you guys."
711,00:41:39.87,00:41:39.87,"You have become masters of the blindside,"
712,00:41:42.67,00:41:42.67,which should make these last three days very interesting
713,00:41:46.17,00:41:46.17,"because clearly, based on tonight's 3-2 vote,"
714,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,three of you are together. The only problem:
715,00:41:52.97,00:41:52.97,ain't nobody playing for third. You guys can head back to camp.
716,00:41:56.03,00:41:56.03,Good night. Stay tuned for scenes
