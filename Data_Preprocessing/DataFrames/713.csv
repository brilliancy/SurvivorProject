192,00:12:35.00,00:12:35.00,>> We finally get to Panama Cityand we're walking up
193,00:12:38.30,00:12:38.30,"the boat ramp and I seein a parking lot all by itself,"
194,00:12:41.90,00:12:41.90,"brand spanking new,a GMC Envoy SUV."
195,00:12:45.37,00:12:45.37,>> PROBST: Let's catch ourselvesa ride...
196,00:12:48.93,00:12:48.93,"unless, of course,you're digging that ride."
197,00:12:50.93,00:12:50.93,">> Yeah.>> Oh, yeah."
198,00:12:52.93,00:12:52.93,>> PROBST: I happen to have thekeys.
199,00:12:54.93,00:12:54.93,"They now belong to you.>> Oh, well, congratulations!"
200,00:12:56.93,00:12:56.93,>> Right on.Let's check it out. Come on.
201,00:12:59.43,00:12:59.43,"Jeff pulled out the keys,and sure enough, the brand-new"
202,00:13:01.90,00:13:01.90,"Envoy is, uh, my new vehicle.(laughs)"
203,00:13:06.50,00:13:06.50,">> Congratulations, man!Congratulations!"
204,00:13:09.53,00:13:09.53,">> PROBST: It's a kind ofa combination SUV, truck, car."
205,00:13:12.10,00:13:12.10,>> Right.>> PROBST: A couple of cool
206,00:13:13.70,00:13:13.70,features. Come back here.This comes with the car.
207,00:13:16.13,00:13:16.13,"It's full-on camping gear.Set this up, it becomes"
208,00:13:18.60,00:13:18.60,"a camper.>> It's an awesome prize, and"
209,00:13:21.00,00:13:21.00,"I love camping, snowboardingand skiing."
210,00:13:23.53,00:13:23.53,So the four-wheel drive andeverything is... it's awesome.
211,00:13:25.93,00:13:25.93,">> PROBST: So, there's a mapinside."
212,00:13:27.87,00:13:27.87,It will lead you to the ruins.I think you'll know 'em when
213,00:13:30.20,00:13:30.20,you see 'em.Food awaits.
214,00:13:32.27,00:13:32.27,"Have a good time, guys.>> 30-plus days ago,"
215,00:13:35.40,00:13:35.40,I would have been pissed offif anyone had won it but me.
216,00:13:38.43,00:13:38.43,"But, uh, at this point in thegame, uh, seeing what Burton's"
217,00:13:41.57,00:13:41.57,"done for the tribe and forme personally, and what he has"
218,00:13:44.90,00:13:44.90,"done challenge-wise, he deservedthe car more than anyone else."
219,00:13:48.27,00:13:48.27,And it's kind of a cool feelingknowing I can say that
220,00:13:51.13,00:13:51.13,"and actually mean it.Win, lose or draw, you're"
221,00:13:54.03,00:13:54.03,the only personthat I like in this game.
222,00:14:01.60,00:14:01.60,"Are you loving it?>> Dude, I can't believe it."
223,00:14:05.27,00:14:05.27,This is amazing.We drove through downtown
224,00:14:13.77,00:14:13.77,"Panama City, and as we'regetting closer, you could see a"
225,00:14:16.80,00:14:16.80,large tower that's stillstanding.
226,00:14:19.10,00:14:19.10,"And then, when you actuallyget in there, there's quite"
227,00:14:21.37,00:14:21.37,a bit of the city leftfrom a structural standpoint--
228,00:14:24.20,00:14:24.20,all the old stone wallsand structures.
229,00:14:30.70,00:14:30.70,"So we pulled into the ruins,and our feast was set up"
230,00:14:34.53,00:14:34.53,under this tent and our jawsjust hit the ground.
231,00:14:38.37,00:14:38.37,"Oh, my Lord.>> Beans, apple sauce, rice,"
232,00:14:41.70,00:14:41.70,fruit...>> Mm-hmm.
233,00:14:43.07,00:14:43.07,">> Dude, marshmallows.>> Wow."
234,00:14:45.37,00:14:45.37,>> I'm gonna start eating.>> There's just food everywhere
235,00:14:48.30,00:14:48.30,"and we started eatingeverything, basically, at the"
236,00:14:51.67,00:14:51.67,same time.We're going to be eating for
237,00:14:53.73,00:14:53.73,"about five hours.>> Oh, my God."
238,00:14:55.63,00:14:55.63,">> There was no first course,second course and dessert,"
239,00:14:58.47,00:14:58.47,it was just anything goes.Oh!
240,00:15:02.07,00:15:02.07,"Your face, dude.Good meal and good company."
241,00:15:06.00,00:15:06.00,">> Mm-hmm, finally.>> To the girls eating mussels."
242,00:15:08.93,00:15:08.93,>> To the girls eating mussels.(Burton chuckling)
243,00:15:12.33,00:15:12.33,">> Jon and I were kind oflaughing because the girls,"
244,00:15:14.97,00:15:14.97,"all they had were musselsthat Jon, Lill and I collected."
245,00:15:18.10,00:15:18.10,And they're not goingto catch any fish.
246,00:15:20.50,00:15:20.50,"I mean, honestly, those threegirls have all been riding"
247,00:15:24.20,00:15:24.20,coattails the entire timethey've been out here.
248,00:15:27.20,00:15:27.20,(birds screeching)>> You don't know what those
249,00:15:35.63,00:15:35.63,boys are cooking up.You don't know what they're
250,00:15:38.03,00:15:38.03,saying.You don't know what they've
251,00:15:40.70,00:15:40.70,"promised all of us.>> Yeah, I know."
252,00:15:43.33,00:15:43.33,They promise everyonesomething different.
253,00:15:44.93,00:15:44.93,>> Mm-hmm.>> Until it comes down
254,00:15:46.87,00:15:46.87,to the very wire.>> Yep.
255,00:15:49.07,00:15:49.07,">> When we got back from thereward today, Lill said that"
256,00:15:51.30,00:15:51.30,"she was kind of scared,um, about trusting the guys."
257,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,"That's why I tell you, don'tlisten to anything Jon says."
258,00:15:57.50,00:15:57.50,">> Jon screwed me once, twice,Jon will screw me again."
259,00:16:00.57,00:16:00.57,"He slapped me in the face once,he slapped me in the face twice,"
260,00:16:03.03,00:16:03.03,he won't slap me...I have always said that they
261,00:16:05.57,00:16:05.57,were both snakes and I havealways said that they're good
262,00:16:07.87,00:16:07.87,"liars.So, everything that Lill was"
263,00:16:10.07,00:16:10.07,saying is stuff that I hadalready mentioned from before.
264,00:16:12.90,00:16:12.90,">> Well, let me tell yousomething, little one."
265,00:16:15.03,00:16:15.03,They're ready to get rid ofyou.
266,00:16:17.00,00:16:17.00,">> I know, that's why I want towin immunity."
267,00:16:18.57,00:16:18.57,>> They're ready to get ridof you before Sandra.
268,00:16:20.40,00:16:20.40,"I wasn't going to tell you that,but I was fighting for you."
269,00:16:23.67,00:16:23.67,"And I said, ""This is not right.It should be Sandra."""
270,00:16:26.73,00:16:26.73,I couldn't lie anymore.I had to tell Darrah.
271,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33,And it pissed me off thatthese two boys were so easy
272,00:16:32.13,00:16:32.13,"to break their alliance.>> Well, I think that we"
273,00:16:36.73,00:16:36.73,"should get rid of the boys.>> All you got to say to me,"
274,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,"""Sandra, whichever one of theguys doesn't have immunity,"
275,00:16:45.47,00:16:45.47,"that's who's going home.""You don't even have to whisper"
276,00:16:47.97,00:16:47.97,and take me in the bushesand talk to me for two hours.
277,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,">> We... wait a minute.The whole funny thing here is,"
278,00:16:53.20,00:16:53.20,"no matter what, I may, uh,still only come in third."
279,00:16:57.20,00:16:57.20,>> But we all have a fairchance.
280,00:16:59.03,00:16:59.03,>> But at least your chancesare better.
281,00:17:00.93,00:17:00.93,>> Neither one of you...you've already told me
282,00:17:02.53,00:17:02.53,you don't want to go up infront of a jury with me.
283,00:17:04.27,00:17:04.27,">> But if you were standingthere, Lill, you'd get"
284,00:17:06.13,00:17:06.13,my million-dollar vote.>> Only if you're on the jury.
285,00:17:08.47,00:17:08.47,>> Lill doesn't seemto understand.
286,00:17:11.00,00:17:11.00,"She keeps thinking that,regardless, she's done at three."
287,00:17:14.23,00:17:14.23,"And I tell her, I'm not stronger than you, Lill."
288,00:17:16.63,00:17:16.63,Have I ever showed you that I was stronger than you in all
289,00:17:18.63,00:17:18.63,these competitions?You're not bad for 50 years old.
290,00:17:21.20,00:17:21.20,"So, if you're with them,you're going to get third."
291,00:17:23.70,00:17:23.70,"But being against us, you havea chance to move up on your own."
292,00:17:26.53,00:17:26.53,>> The only way you're goingto have a chance at one and two
293,00:17:29.13,00:17:29.13,is with us three.Jon's going to take Burton.
294,00:17:32.53,00:17:32.53,Burton's going to take Jon.>> Let's see who does
295,00:17:35.90,00:17:35.90,"immunity tomorrow, guys.'Cause I think we need to get..."
296,00:17:38.80,00:17:38.80,think about Burton first.>> Because he's the strongest?
297,00:17:42.00,00:17:42.00,">> So, if Burton wins immunity,Jon's gone, right?"
298,00:17:47.70,00:17:47.70,>> Right.>> If one of us three win
299,00:17:49.87,00:17:49.87,"immunity, Burton's gone.>> I am totally psyched."
300,00:17:52.70,00:17:52.70,I am very happy knowing thatthere's still a chance.
301,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,The only problem now is that Ihad so many plans of sabotage
302,00:18:00.73,00:18:00.73,"that now I have to hold off,because I think it's in my"
303,00:18:03.93,00:18:03.93,best interest not to start commotion.
304,00:18:06.73,00:18:06.73,"I'd be happy with third.>> Heck, yeah."
305,00:18:09.43,00:18:09.43,"I would be, too.>> All right, let's..."
306,00:18:11.13,00:18:11.13,let's do this.Let's see who gets
307,00:18:13.10,00:18:13.10,immunity tomorrow.>> They're going home.
308,00:18:14.80,00:18:14.80,It's going to be us three girlsin the end.
309,00:18:21.37,00:18:21.37,>> Are we worried aboutthe girls strategizing
310,00:18:24.10,00:18:24.10,"against us?>> No, 'cause I think that..."
311,00:18:26.07,00:18:26.07,>> I feel like we're prettyconfident in our abilities...
312,00:18:27.90,00:18:27.90,">> Yeah, I think we can squashtheir plans pretty quickly."
313,00:18:29.87,00:18:29.87,">> Yeah. I...>> I mean, not one of them has"
314,00:18:31.50,00:18:31.50,had a strategy yet in this game.>> Yeah.
315,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,>> I don't know why it'dstart now.
316,00:18:35.20,00:18:35.20,">> Yeah, exactly.Burton and I basically"
317,00:18:36.73,00:18:36.73,just went over the factthat the three girls
318,00:18:38.67,00:18:38.67,were probably discussinga girls-versus-guys plan
319,00:18:40.53,00:18:40.53,while we're gone.But it only takes one person
320,00:18:42.70,00:18:42.70,"to swing the vote.So, figure we had"
321,00:18:45.03,00:18:45.03,a one-out-of-three chanceof pulling one of them back.
322,00:18:47.60,00:18:47.60,And we feel that we definitelyhave an intellectual advantage
323,00:18:49.80,00:18:49.80,over the others.>> Good to go.
324,00:18:51.80,00:18:51.80,"Hey, hey.Dude, this thing's pretty sweet."
325,00:18:54.77,00:18:54.77,"Jon and I were just kind ofshooting the breeze,"
326,00:18:58.00,00:18:58.00,talking about not talking aboutthe car when we got back to
327,00:19:00.53,00:19:00.53,"camp, because it is somethingthat someone might hold against"
328,00:19:04.13,00:19:04.13,me.I think we should be able to get
329,00:19:06.67,00:19:06.67,"back and smooth everything over.We literally need to be like,"
330,00:19:09.33,00:19:09.33,"""Lill, ""we've gotten you thisfar."""
331,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,"Like, ""Don't mess it up.""We were talking about"
332,00:19:14.73,00:19:14.73,"who we trusted, who we didn't.We had told Lill that we were"
333,00:19:17.73,00:19:17.73,going to vote Darrah out nextand she wasn't comfortable
334,00:19:20.70,00:19:20.70,with it.So I don't know if I can trust
335,00:19:22.83,00:19:22.83,anything she says to mehere on out.
336,00:19:24.93,00:19:24.93,I think we approach Sandrajust as a backup.
337,00:19:28.13,00:19:28.13,">> Yeah.>> Be like, ""Hey, Sandra..."""
338,00:19:30.80,00:19:30.80,">> ""Final Three."">> ""Final Three..."""
339,00:19:33.50,00:19:33.50,">> She doesn't trust us at all,but you know what,"
340,00:19:36.17,00:19:36.17,I bet she would again.How many times have I dogged
341,00:19:38.70,00:19:38.70,"that girl out?>> To be honest, Jon and I"
342,00:19:41.73,00:19:41.73,have been running the showfor the last 20 days nearly.
343,00:19:45.13,00:19:45.13,"And those three girls,I don't think they could come"
344,00:19:48.07,00:19:48.07,up with a decent strategyif they had to.
345,00:19:49.90,00:19:49.90,>> We have played everythingabout as perfectly as it
346,00:19:53.83,00:19:53.83,can be played in this game.>> A lot of people are about
347,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,"to get run over by the bus,but you and I are good."
348,00:20:00.57,00:20:00.57,>> Exactly.(Jon laughing)
349,00:20:28.57,00:20:28.57,>> I don't know why God'sputting me through this.
350,00:20:33.40,00:20:33.40,"I just can't sleep, guys,and it hurts."
351,00:20:35.47,00:20:35.47,>> You can take it for fourdays.
352,00:20:37.57,00:20:37.57,You will have to take it forfour days.
353,00:20:40.27,00:20:40.27,>> You going to have to.>> You going to have to take it
354,00:20:42.67,00:20:42.67,for four days.>> It's going to drag you along.
355,00:20:44.87,00:20:44.87,">> I can't sleep because,you know, my arms and my legs"
356,00:20:49.00,00:20:49.00,are on fire.I'm just...
357,00:20:51.70,00:20:51.70,I just feel numb this morning.I'm just...
358,00:20:54.60,00:20:54.60,"I don't know if it's menopause.I don't know what it is,"
359,00:20:58.17,00:20:58.17,"but it's hurting me.>> I think, yeah..."
360,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,I think you're stressing now.>> If I could just get some
361,00:21:04.13,00:21:04.13,rest.>> You have to think positive.
362,00:21:07.13,00:21:07.13,">> Yeah, but, see, if I couldjust rest in my mind."
363,00:21:10.13,00:21:10.13,My mind is just not rested.>> Are you thinking about
364,00:21:13.60,00:21:13.60,Burton?Is that why you're so stressed?
365,00:21:15.40,00:21:15.40,Is that one of the primaryreasons?
366,00:21:17.70,00:21:17.70,"I'm worried that he's goingto get immunity and Jon goes,"
367,00:21:20.73,00:21:20.73,and then he's going to attack.(sighs)
368,00:21:33.30,00:21:33.30,>> You think Lill's gettingnervous?
369,00:21:35.43,00:21:35.43,>> She stresses out aboutevery little thing.
370,00:21:39.97,00:21:39.97,">> I would hate for today to beone of those relaxed days,"
371,00:21:43.23,00:21:43.23,'cause we need to get Burton outof here as soon as possible.
372,00:21:45.50,00:21:45.50,>> Mm-hmm.>> 'Cause one whole day is
373,00:21:47.90,00:21:47.90,enough time to turn anybody'shead around.
374,00:21:52.53,00:21:52.53,That's not good.>> Uh-uh.

567,00:33:19.03,00:33:19.03,">> Uh, D won for the third timein a row."
568,00:33:22.47,00:33:22.47,"Uh, Lill is now next to goas a result."
569,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,"And, you know, I feelkind of bad about that,"
570,00:33:27.23,00:33:27.23,"but Lill has, uh,physically and emotionally"
571,00:33:29.77,00:33:29.77,just broken down at this point.Lill has not talked with us
572,00:33:32.90,00:33:32.90,"like she usually does.Uh, Lill has, uh, not done"
573,00:33:36.37,00:33:36.37,the work that she...that she usually does.
574,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,"And, uh, that'sa different Lill."
575,00:33:41.30,00:33:41.30,And her actions are telling methat I can't trust her
576,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,"right now.What's the word, T-bird?"
577,00:33:46.03,00:33:46.03,>> I just gave Burtonmy full report.
578,00:33:49.00,00:33:49.00,Go ask Burton.I'm not feeling well.
579,00:33:53.10,00:33:53.10,I'm not sleeping.I hurt like hell.
580,00:33:55.97,00:33:55.97,"So please, you two,stop playing tag team"
581,00:33:59.07,00:33:59.07,"on me, please.>> We're not playing tag team."
582,00:34:01.40,00:34:01.40,I was just askinghow you're doing.
583,00:34:03.60,00:34:03.60,">> Oh. I'm okay.>> No, no, no."
584,00:34:19.03,00:34:19.03,">> Mm-hmm.>> Lill is, Lill is a basket"
585,00:34:24.87,00:34:24.87,case right now.>> I know.
586,00:34:26.23,00:34:26.23,>> Her body is shutting off.She sleeps an hour a night.
587,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,She's freaking out.She's a disaster.
588,00:34:31.60,00:34:31.60,"If, if no other reason,that's why we got"
589,00:34:33.97,00:34:33.97,to get rid of her.Lill's acting weird.
590,00:34:35.70,00:34:35.70,She's on her last legs.She's just not doing well.
591,00:34:38.30,00:34:38.30,And she's developing a prettytight relationship with Darrah
592,00:34:40.57,00:34:40.57,"that's making me nervous.Um, but the way Jon and I"
593,00:34:43.77,00:34:43.77,"are seeing it,if we can get Sandra to vote"
594,00:34:47.10,00:34:47.10,"with us to get Lill off,um, I think"
595,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,it'll be a pretty good move.>> This is not good for
596,00:34:52.03,00:34:52.03,business.>> What?
597,00:34:53.30,00:34:53.30,>> This chick winningeverything.
598,00:34:55.57,00:34:55.57,">> No.So, here's the deal."
599,00:34:57.53,00:34:57.53,"Lill told me that you threehad talked about,"
600,00:35:00.07,00:35:00.07,"like, a girls' alliance.>> She must be making that up,"
601,00:35:02.43,00:35:02.43,'cause I'm not goingwith Lill anyway.
602,00:35:04.27,00:35:04.27,I know how much...how she feels about me.
603,00:35:06.17,00:35:06.17,"She... they whisper about me.I know they do,"
604,00:35:09.20,00:35:09.20,regardless of this grandmaniceness that she portrays.
605,00:35:11.57,00:35:11.57,>> What about Darrah?Same thing?
606,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,>> Darrah don't even talk to me.You know what I'm saying?
607,00:35:15.57,00:35:15.57,">> Well, you two should...>> We don't, we haven't even "
608,00:35:17.53,00:35:17.53,been talking about chocolate chips which is something
609,00:35:19.37,00:35:19.37,that we always talk about.>> Yeah.
610,00:35:21.10,00:35:21.10,">> So I wouldn't worryif I were you,"
611,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,'cause I'm a write Lill's namedown big as ...
612,00:35:26.37,00:35:26.37,"If that's what's goingto save me, then so be it."
613,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,">> Uh, I've really neverspoken strategy with Sandra."
614,00:35:31.73,00:35:31.73,"The good thing about her,though, is she'd vote out her"
615,00:35:34.47,00:35:34.47,"best friend, her worst enemy.She would go to the next level"
616,00:35:37.10,00:35:37.10,with five people she hatedto get to that next level.
617,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"So, it's very cut and drywith Sandra."
618,00:35:42.83,00:35:42.83,"There's no, ""Oh, I havefeelings for this person"""
619,00:35:45.43,00:35:45.43,"or ""I don't knowif we should do that."""
620,00:35:47.07,00:35:47.07,"She doesn't care.She goes, ""If I'm staying in"
621,00:35:48.93,00:35:48.93,"the game, I'll vote for them."">> That's a good fire, right"
622,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17,there.>> Mm-hmm.
623,00:35:57.57,00:35:57.57,">> No, no, no.>> Leave her something."
624,00:35:59.27,00:35:59.27,">> We're definitely going toleave her food, but we're all"
625,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,"100% in agreement for, um, Lill?>> Yeah."
626,00:36:06.03,00:36:06.03,">> And, and it's the smartestthing for all of us to do"
627,00:36:08.23,00:36:08.23,because...>> Absolutely. We all agree.
628,00:36:09.97,00:36:09.97,">> With her in the game,if someone ends up against her,"
629,00:36:11.93,00:36:11.93,they're not going to win.>> Right.
630,00:36:13.67,00:36:13.67,>> All right.>> All three girls are as dumb.
631,00:36:15.57,00:36:15.57,There's no...they share a brain...
632,00:36:18.03,00:36:18.03,"I don't even think they share awhole brain, or obviously they"
633,00:36:20.10,00:36:20.10,"would figure out, ""Hey, we canget rid of these guys."""
634,00:36:22.50,00:36:22.50,"They're foolish.I mean, uh, the girls"
635,00:36:24.53,00:36:24.53,"in this game have...have done nothing to, uh,"
636,00:36:27.30,00:36:27.30,nothing for women's rightsor anything like that.
637,00:36:29.87,00:36:29.87,"I mean, like, uh,they'd be better off, you know,"
638,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,"scrubbing potatoes and moppingfloors, uh, to... to get bills"
639,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,"passed at this point.Uh, they, they've shown"
640,00:36:37.73,00:36:37.73,they're nothing more thanfollowers in this game.
641,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,I think it's downright foolishthat they didn't talk.
642,00:36:42.63,00:36:42.63,"But, uh, I felt, and willcontinue to feel that I'm much"
643,00:36:45.70,00:36:45.70,"smarter than them anyways.So, I guess, uh,"
644,00:36:48.43,00:36:48.43,kind of par for the course.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
