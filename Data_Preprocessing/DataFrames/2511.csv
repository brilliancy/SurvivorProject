451,00:29:13.30,00:29:13.30,THIS IS OKAY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
452,00:29:15.70,00:29:15.70,BECAUSE WE MADE A PACT. AND WE'VE STUCK TO IT.
453,00:29:20.37,00:29:20.37,"IT'S PENNER. >> I LOVE THIS GAME, AND I WANT"
454,00:29:22.73,00:29:22.73,TO BE A GOOD PLAYER. I JUST-- I THINK PERHAPS I'M NOT
455,00:29:26.80,00:29:26.80,CUT OUT FOR THIS GAME. I THINK IT'S TOO BIG FOR ME.
456,00:29:36.63,00:29:36.63,I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THIS GAME. I JUST DON'T EYE DON'T WANT TO
457,00:29:40.03,00:29:40.03,"LIE TO YOU THAT I'M TOTALLY IN. >> OH, COME ON."
458,00:29:43.17,00:29:43.17,CUT THE CRAP. REALLY?

473,00:30:49.10,00:30:49.10,>> I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT. I'M SO NOT GOOD AT THIS GAME.
474,00:30:58.33,00:30:58.33,>> THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
475,00:31:01.63,00:31:01.63,TO ME. BECAUSE I DIDN'T MAKE EMPTY

480,00:31:15.77,00:31:15.77,GAME BECAUSE I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
481,00:31:17.67,00:31:17.67,>> I DON'T. >> I KNOW YOU DON'T.
482,00:31:19.30,00:31:19.30,">> I REALLY, REALLY-- I REALLY, REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT."
483,00:31:22.47,00:31:22.47,>> LISA ONCE AGAIN LOST HER MIND.
484,00:31:26.20,00:31:26.20,AND SHE HAD TO CONFESS TO ME THAT SHE WAS IN ANOTHER
485,00:31:29.83,00:31:29.83,"ALLIANCE, THAT SHE'S VOTING FOR ME TONIGHT."
486,00:31:32.67,00:31:32.67,AND I GUESS TO HER CREDIT SHE'S GOING TO STICK BY HER GUNS.
487,00:31:36.53,00:31:36.53,SHE WILL NOT BE SUEDE. I THINK HER GUNS ARE RIDICULOUS.
488,00:31:43.47,00:31:43.47,">> I TO TELL YOU, AND I KNOW YOU BELIEVE ME, I LIKE YOU MORE THAN"
489,00:31:49.60,00:31:49.60,ANYBODY OUT HERE. I WANT TO GO TO THE FINAL THREE

498,00:32:38.77,00:32:38.77,THE MIDDLE WITHOUT MAKING A COMMITMENT TO ANYBODY.
499,00:32:40.97,00:32:40.97,THAT WAS PROBABLY MY MISTAKE. I DID NOT CHOOSE A SIDE.
500,00:32:51.10,00:32:51.10,"WELL, WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR DENISE."
501,00:32:53.40,00:32:53.40,>> I'M ON BOARD. PEOPLE ARE A BIT WARY OF MALCOLM

515,00:33:54.97,00:33:54.97,CONFLICTED BUT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GO AGAINST HER WORD.
516,00:33:58.43,00:33:58.43,SO SHE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR ME. AND IT'S UP TO-- IT'S UP TO YOU.
517,00:34:04.00,00:34:04.00,>> TRIBAL COUNCIL DAY IS A ZOO. MY DILEMMA IS I'M GOING TO MAKE
