34,00:01:40.75,00:01:40.75,A twist temporarily split thetribe into two random teams.
35,00:01:44.54,00:01:44.54,Yau-Man working quickly.The orange team is heading out.
36,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,And Yau Man proved himself avaluable asset.
37,00:01:50.46,00:01:50.46,"Yau-man makes a last-minuteswitch, and it's a good thing he"
38,00:01:52.38,00:01:52.38,did.Orange team wins immunity and
39,00:01:55.08,00:01:55.08,"reward!Michelle, Stacy, Alex, Mookie,"
40,00:01:59.25,00:01:59.25,"Dreamz, you will not be goingback to camp."
41,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,We're heading to tribal councilright now.
42,00:02:05.54,00:02:05.54,At tribal council...Ninth person voted out and the
43,00:02:08.08,00:02:08.08,third member of our jury...Dreamz waffled and betrayed
44,00:02:11.08,00:02:11.08,Mookie when he voted forMichelle instead of Stacy.
45,00:02:13.54,00:02:13.54,"Michelle, the tribe has spoken.Nine are left."
46,00:02:18.29,00:02:18.29,"Who will be voted out tonight?>> Guaranteed, I think, Michelle"
47,00:02:38.42,00:02:38.42,or Stacy are gone.>> Who is Dreamz more tight
48,00:02:41.67,00:02:41.67,"with?>> I don't know, because he"
49,00:02:45.79,00:02:45.79,doesn't like Stacy at all.>> Welcome home.
50,00:02:59.88,00:02:59.88,">> Voting suck?>> Yeah, it sucked."
51,00:03:10.04,00:03:10.04,>> I guess you could say I'mpretty upset right now.
52,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,"Earlier on, Dreamz and I had aconversation of exactly going"
53,00:03:15.29,00:03:15.29,"back to the original plan thatwe had, that we would take out"
54,00:03:17.88,00:03:17.88,Stacy.But Dreamz still votes off
55,00:03:20.17,00:03:20.17,Michelle.We just basically gave all the
56,00:03:22.08,00:03:22.08,"power to Alex.You know, we just basically"
57,00:03:24.08,00:03:24.08,screwed ourselves.>> I made it very clear I that
58,00:03:29.25,00:03:29.25,"was voting for Michelle.I thought you were, like, doing"
59,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,your own thing.I was like...
60,00:03:33.08,00:03:33.08,">> No.>> Okay, that's fine."
61,00:03:34.79,00:03:34.79,"It's just miscommunication.But listen, the way to seal the"
62,00:03:38.29,00:03:38.29,final four in blood is to takethe immunity idol and rotate it.
63,00:03:41.79,00:03:41.79,"Each of us gets it a day, andthat way..."
64,00:03:44.12,00:03:44.12,">> That does nothing.>> It does, dude."
65,00:03:46.29,00:03:46.29,It does.>> It doesn't do anything.
66,00:03:48.12,00:03:48.12,">> It does.It does, Mookie."
67,00:03:50.12,00:03:50.12,Because what it tells me andtells everybody is that none of
68,00:03:52.00,00:03:52.00,"us can screw each other over.If I... look, the three of us"
69,00:03:54.25,00:03:54.25,"found it together.You started digging in one area,"
70,00:03:56.38,00:03:56.38,I pointed to another area.We were all digging.
71,00:03:58.96,00:03:58.96,You happened to be the first oneto touch it.
72,00:04:01.33,00:04:01.33,And now you're telling me you'renot going to part with it unless
73,00:04:04.29,00:04:04.29,"only on your terms.That's messed up, dude."
74,00:04:07.25,00:04:07.25,>> I'm not saying that.>> That's exactly what you're
75,00:04:09.08,00:04:09.08,saying.You're saying something
76,00:04:10.58,00:04:10.58,"different?Be honest, man."
77,00:04:13.88,00:04:13.88,>> You know what?What's going to happen now is
78,00:04:17.25,00:04:17.25,"Alex is like, ""You know what?You have to trust us, and we're"
79,00:04:19.50,00:04:19.50,each going to share the immunityidol.
80,00:04:21.29,00:04:21.29,"We're going to hold it onceevery day."""
81,00:04:26.29,00:04:26.29,"Then he's like, ""Four Horsemenis nothing."""
82,00:04:29.00,00:04:29.00,"No we can't.No we don't, because they don't"
83,00:04:31.92,00:04:31.92,trust us.This is what just... you screwed
84,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,everything with that.>> When we got to tribal
85,00:04:37.67,00:04:37.67,"council, Michelle start talking.And when she says in the tribal"
86,00:04:40.12,00:04:40.12,"council, ""I don't know Dre,I never hung around him,"""
87,00:04:44.42,00:04:44.42,"it kind of let me know, ""Wait aminute, I don't know her"
88,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,neither.I don't know what alliance she's
89,00:04:48.21,00:04:48.21,"in.""So it kind of scared me a little"
90,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,"bit, so it caused me to vote hername."
91,00:04:51.71,00:04:51.71,"If she never said that, she'dstill be here right now."
92,00:04:54.79,00:04:54.79,">> You did, trust me.Don't worry about it."
93,00:04:57.29,00:04:57.29,Trust me.You just screwed both of us.
94,00:05:42.71,00:05:42.71,">> Well, the tribe, the otherhalf returned from tribal"
95,00:05:45.38,00:05:45.38,"council, and I was hoping thatStacy was gone."
96,00:05:51.17,00:05:51.17,"It was definitely a shock.I was very disappointed, and"
97,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,that just flipped the wholescript around for everything in
98,00:05:57.42,00:05:57.42,my head.>> If you all want to take me in
99,00:06:01.96,00:06:01.96,"as a swing vote we'll make it tothe five with me, you,"
100,00:06:05.08,00:06:05.08,"Cassandra, Yau-- because I knowyou're tight with Yau, Yau's a"
101,00:06:08.71,00:06:08.71,"solid, solid, person-- andDreamz."
102,00:06:12.12,00:06:12.12,"The rest of them, they're allbackstabbers."
103,00:06:14.83,00:06:14.83,">> I think ... I mean, as longas we take out Alex first."
104,00:06:19.38,00:06:19.38,">> That's fine with me, but thething is Dreamz is not going to"
105,00:06:22.42,00:06:22.42,want to take Alex out.>> You think Dreamz is not going
106,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,to want to take Alex out?>> He likes Alex.
107,00:06:27.08,00:06:27.08,>> When Boo and I had our man-to-man talk and looked each
108,00:06:30.08,00:06:30.08,"other in the eye andsaid he was with me, I still"
109,00:06:32.21,00:06:32.21,didn't buy it.Boo is just trying to save his
110,00:06:35.00,00:06:35.00,own neck at all times.But I need to know if he's with
111,00:06:37.75,00:06:37.75,"us.I mean, because we really need"
112,00:06:39.50,00:06:39.50,his vote since we don't haveMichelle.
113,00:06:41.92,00:06:41.92,"That should go a few hours.Basically, the main core is"
114,00:06:48.04,00:06:48.04,"myself, Yau, and Cassandra.I trust them completely."
115,00:06:52.12,00:06:52.12,Dreamz is definitely a wild cardand I don't know if I trust
116,00:06:56.25,00:06:56.25,"Mookie all the way yet, becausehe's already kind of... tries to"
117,00:06:59.25,00:06:59.25,manipulate a lot as well.It's that part of the chess game
118,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,"where you've already lost acouple of really good pieces,"
119,00:07:06.25,00:07:06.25,and now you have to reallythink.
120,00:07:08.54,00:07:08.54,You can't trust everybody.But I like playing this game.
121,00:07:10.88,00:07:10.88,And I am still here.>> PROBST: You guys ready to get

400,00:24:25.21,00:24:25.21,Not a bit of breeze out here.Edgardo looks like he could go
401,00:24:37.96,00:24:37.96,all day.Mookie looks like he might be
402,00:24:40.42,00:24:40.42,asleep he's so comfortable.>> Ouch!

433,00:27:23.96,00:27:23.96,"Boo almost loses it, and saveshimself again."

444,00:28:17.33,00:28:17.33,luck to everybody.>> By Cassandra sending me to
445,00:28:25.29,00:28:25.29,Exile Island she ruined the gamefor herself and her alliance.
446,00:28:27.38,00:28:27.38,I am going to take out her wholealliance one by one.
447,00:28:37.04,00:28:37.04,Knowing that Earl potentiallyhas the idol does change the
448,00:28:40.25,00:28:40.25,game a little bit in terms ofstrategy.
449,00:28:42.75,00:28:42.75,"You want to get the guy with theimmunity idol, and get him by"
450,00:28:44.83,00:28:44.83,surprise.And hopefully we can take him
451,00:28:47.58,00:28:47.58,"out, and take him out with theimmunity idol, and he won't use"
452,00:28:49.50,00:28:49.50,"it.>> Hey, look-- I trust you guys."
453,00:28:52.12,00:28:52.12,You're my best bet.>> When I was on Exile Island I
454,00:28:55.67,00:28:55.67,"committed myself to that.I'm like, ""I will not be"
455,00:28:57.92,00:28:57.92,faltered.I will not be wavered by

457,00:29:01.79,00:29:01.79,"sticking with-- Earl, Yau Man,Boo."
458,00:29:04.00,00:29:04.00,It's done.>> It's done.
459,00:29:05.67,00:29:05.67,>> It's done.>> Are you 100% on Stacy?
460,00:29:07.42,00:29:07.42,>> Stacy is with us.She's with us.
461,00:29:10.08,00:29:10.08,>> Are you sure?>> It's so weird.
462,00:29:18.46,00:29:18.46,"We're going go to tribalcouncil, and I have no idea"
463,00:29:20.17,00:29:20.17,what's going on.I have no idea.
464,00:29:34.75,00:29:34.75,>> But it makes no point if I'mthe only person that's voting
465,00:29:37.25,00:29:37.25,"for Alex.Okay, as long as I have that"
466,00:29:42.04,00:29:42.04,assurance.Then I'll do that to save myself
467,00:29:47.17,00:29:47.17,then.Are you in?
468,00:30:11.92,00:30:11.92,">> I, of course, want to go withthe majority."
469,00:30:14.00,00:30:14.00,So it's who do I trust more atthis point in the game?
470,00:30:16.58,00:30:16.58,I don't owe anything to Alex.If saving myself means severing
471,00:30:19.29,00:30:19.29,"a tie, then I'll sever that tie.>> That means she's not in,"
472,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,dude.No.
473,00:30:41.12,00:30:41.12,>> What do you think?I think not.
474,00:30:43.17,00:30:43.17,>> I think... I don't know.I think not.
475,00:30:48.04,00:30:48.04,>> Pretty much.>> You think Mookie is going to
476,00:30:55.92,00:30:55.92,do that?>> That's the thing.
477,00:31:00.46,00:31:00.46,If Stacy comes through today...>> Os to show the immunity idol.
478,00:31:10.08,00:31:10.08,">> Show the immunity idol.All right, well, have that in"
479,00:31:13.21,00:31:13.21,"line, and have that thing readyjust in case."
480,00:31:21.00,00:31:21.00,>> My hope was that Stacy wouldvote with us today to make it
481,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,"5-3, but it seems like she's notvoting with us anymore."
482,00:31:27.12,00:31:27.12,I don't want to use the immunityidol this early in the game.
483,00:31:30.83,00:31:30.83,"But at the same time, I have tostrategically think about what's"
484,00:31:33.71,00:31:33.71,going to get me the furthest inthis game.
485,00:31:36.12,00:31:36.12,"I can save Alex by giving himthe immunity idol, but this"
486,00:31:38.62,00:31:38.62,early in the game to use theimmunity idol is kind of a
487,00:31:41.12,00:31:41.12,disadvantage.So things have gotten very
488,00:31:43.42,00:31:43.42,"complicated.>> Mook, Mook, Mook, Mook."
489,00:32:49.58,00:32:49.58,">> Turns out that Mookie gavethe idol to Alex, so we're going"
490,00:32:53.58,00:32:53.58,to vote Mookie just to catchthem off guard.
491,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,">> Dreamz, Alex, Mookie and Iare voting for Cassandra."
492,00:33:16.71,00:33:16.71,I think that's the smartestmove.
493,00:33:18.67,00:33:18.67,"And also, it will be like... youknow, have the hardest punch at"
494,00:33:20.46,00:33:20.46,tribal council.This is an all-or-nothing move.
495,00:33:23.50,00:33:23.50,"But if it works out, it willprobably be one of the best"
496,00:33:25.79,00:33:25.79,moves ever.>> I think we should talk about
497,00:33:52.29,00:33:52.29,"it between the five of us.Look, we should do... look, we"
498,00:33:54.04,00:33:54.04,"should do the five of us forEdgardo, and not say anything to"
499,00:33:56.71,00:33:56.71,anybody else.That's it.
500,00:34:07.17,00:34:07.17,>> What's going on now is totalchaos.
501,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,A lot of people are paranoid.The panic button has been
502,00:34:12.71,00:34:12.71,pushed.Mookie had the idol.
503,00:34:17.33,00:34:17.33,"He actually gave it to Alex.So that was from our source,"
504,00:34:21.17,00:34:21.17,"which is Dreamz, but it could bea test."
505,00:34:25.12,00:34:25.12,"It doesn't matter, because we'resmarter than that, so we won't"
506,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,vote Alex or Mookie.We're going to vote Edgardo.
507,00:34:30.71,00:34:30.71,">> Alex, Alex.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
508,00:35:32.88,00:35:32.88,"the members of our jury.Rocky, Lisi, and Michelle, voted"

510,00:35:49.25,00:35:49.25,scramble when you got back afterthe challenge today?
511,00:35:51.88,00:35:51.88,">> Jeff, if you was on thatbeach, it was chaotic."
512,00:35:54.79,00:35:54.79,"The most chaotic day of anytime-- swing pitchers, swing"
513,00:35:59.25,00:35:59.25,"voters, swing hitters.And I'm talking on behalf of"
514,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,everybody.It's the most chaotic day ever.

516,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,majority is.I'm lost.
517,00:36:08.92,00:36:08.92,"I'm, like, paranoid.I've been paranoid ever since..."
518,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,"I mean, I'm paranoid right now.>> PROBST: Yau-Man, the one"
519,00:36:13.71,00:36:13.71,guy who doesn't have to beparanoid tonight is you.
520,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,>> This is the first time I'vecome to a tribal council meeting
521,00:36:21.46,00:36:21.46,with a regular heart rate andnormal blood pressure.
522,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,And that's a good thing for anold man.
523,00:36:28.04,00:36:28.04,">> PROBST: Mookie, so you'regone two days, and you come back"
524,00:36:31.75,00:36:31.75,to the most chaotic day outhere.
525,00:36:34.83,00:36:34.83,">> Like Edgardo said, tons ofdifferent names coming up."
526,00:36:38.58,00:36:38.58,"I'm thinking I'm one of thepeople, since I was at Exile."
527,00:36:42.46,00:36:42.46,"I don't know what's going on,either."
528,00:36:44.25,00:36:44.25,But I guess I have to use my ownjudgment.
529,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, the way theidol plays this season is a"
530,00:36:48.12,00:36:48.12,little different.How does that impact how you
531,00:36:50.75,00:36:50.75,vote?>> If we suspect someone has the
532,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,"idol, we should try to avoidvoting for that person and vote"
533,00:36:58.42,00:36:58.42,somebody in his alliance outfirst.
534,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,There's two ways to defeat anarmy.
535,00:37:03.62,00:37:03.62,One is to cut off the head.The other is to take away all
536,00:37:05.71,00:37:05.71,"the soldiers.>> PROBST: Alex, how much time"
537,00:37:09.62,00:37:09.62,do you spend thinking about theidol in terms of your strategy?
538,00:37:13.46,00:37:13.46,">> Logically speaking, I'm goingto suspect that the people who"
539,00:37:16.83,00:37:16.83,"have been to Exile Island, likeEarl, are probably going to have"
540,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,it.So that tells me either avoid
541,00:37:22.12,00:37:22.12,Earl or try to take out peoplein an Earl's alliance.
542,00:37:27.25,00:37:27.25,">> PROBST: Dreamz, how crazy isthis vote going to be tonight?"
543,00:37:29.88,00:37:29.88,>> This vote right here is goingto determine everything in the

546,00:37:37.67,00:37:37.67,"to the vote.First thing, if somebody has the"
547,00:37:39.96,00:37:39.96,"hidden immunity idol and youwant to play it, you would"
548,00:37:42.12,00:37:42.12,"present it to me after we voted,but before I read the votes."
549,00:37:45.38,00:37:45.38,"Yau-Man, you have individualimmunity."
550,00:37:48.33,00:37:48.33,"You can, of course, give that tosomebody if you want to, or you"
551,00:37:50.54,00:37:50.54,can hang on to it.>> I'll hang on to it for
552,00:37:53.42,00:37:53.42,tonight.>> PROBST: Yau-Man is safe.
553,00:37:55.54,00:37:55.54,You cannot vote for Yau-Mantonight.
554,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,Everybody else is fair game.It's time to vote.
555,00:37:59.79,00:37:59.79,"Alex, you're up.>> A strategic move."

561,00:39:27.88,00:39:27.88,Alex is playing the hiddenimmunity idol.
