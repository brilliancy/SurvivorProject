2,00:00:03.21,00:00:03.21,Survivor: The two tribes paddled to Exile
3,00:00:06.21,00:00:06.21,"Island and merged into one. >> ""Drop your old buffs and wear"
4,00:00:09.62,00:00:09.62,"these new ones as you paddle to your home, the old Moto camp."""
5,00:00:13.62,00:00:13.62,>> I'll probably get a turn at the bed tonight.
6,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,"Finally, things are looking up. >> PROBST: When they returned to"
7,00:00:19.88,00:00:19.88,Moto's beach of luxury... >> What the hell?
8,00:00:23.04,00:00:23.04,>> PROBST: ...everything was gone.
9,00:00:24.79,00:00:24.79,">> Oh, my god! >> Oh, no."
10,00:00:26.62,00:00:26.62,"This is like a bad dream. >> No bed, no couch, no shelter,"
11,00:00:29.29,00:00:29.29,no nothing. >> PROBST: The new merged tribe
12,00:00:33.25,00:00:33.25,"contained two alliances-- the Four Horsemen of Alex, Edgardo,"
13,00:00:36.25,00:00:36.25,"Mookie, and the not-so-reliable Dreamz..."
14,00:00:40.08,00:00:40.08,">> Unless I'm mistaken, the four of us are controlling this game"
15,00:00:42.04,00:00:42.04,right now. >> PROBST: ...and a separate
16,00:00:44.08,00:00:44.08,alliance of four. >> There's a tribe within the
17,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17,"tribe-- myself, Michelle, Cassandra and Yau."
18,00:00:50.04,00:00:50.04,>> PROBST: Leaving Stacy and Boo on the outs.
19,00:00:56.71,00:00:56.71,Mookie finally told Dreamz about finding the hidden immunity idol
20,00:00:59.08,00:00:59.08,at the old Ravu camp. >> But you can't say a word.
21,00:01:03.42,00:01:03.42,">> Do I look like... shut up! We had a pact, and it kind of"
22,00:01:06.67,00:01:06.67,"made me not trust them a little bit, and made me feel I'm on the"
23,00:01:08.46,00:01:08.46,outskirts. So I'm going to trust them until
24,00:01:10.79,00:01:10.79,I can't trust them no more. >> PROBST: And the Four
25,00:01:17.50,00:01:17.50,Horsemen's alliance began to fall apart.
26,00:01:19.21,00:01:19.21,>> They just want Stacy on their side to take one of us out.
27,00:01:21.17,00:01:21.17,">> No way, no. Point blank, no."
28,00:01:23.08,00:01:23.08,">> PROBST: In order to protect themselves, Mookie and Dreamz"
29,00:01:25.54,00:01:25.54,decided to go against the Four Horsemen and target Stacy.
30,00:01:29.54,00:01:29.54,>> I'll really looking forward to voting off Stacy.
31,00:01:32.21,00:01:32.21,She's got to go. >> PROBST: At the immunity
32,00:01:34.29,00:01:34.29,challenge... Reveal.
33,00:01:36.62,00:01:36.62,If you have orange go to the orange mat.
34,00:01:38.67,00:01:38.67,"If you have green, go to the green mat."
35,00:01:40.75,00:01:40.75,A twist temporarily split the tribe into two random teams.
36,00:01:44.54,00:01:44.54,Yau-Man working quickly. The orange team is heading out.
37,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,And Yau Man proved himself a valuable asset.
38,00:01:50.46,00:01:50.46,"Yau-man makes a last-minute switch, and it's a good thing he"
39,00:01:52.38,00:01:52.38,did. Orange team wins immunity and
40,00:01:55.08,00:01:55.08,"reward! Michelle, Stacy, Alex, Mookie,"
41,00:01:59.25,00:01:59.25,"Dreamz, you will not be going back to camp."
42,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,We're heading to tribal council right now.
43,00:02:05.54,00:02:05.54,At tribal council... Ninth person voted out and the
44,00:02:08.08,00:02:08.08,third member of our jury... Dreamz waffled and betrayed
45,00:02:11.08,00:02:11.08,Mookie when he voted for Michelle instead of Stacy.
46,00:02:13.54,00:02:13.54,"Michelle, the tribe has spoken. Nine are left."
47,00:02:18.29,00:02:18.29,"Who will be voted out tonight? >> Guaranteed, I think, Michelle"
48,00:02:38.42,00:02:38.42,or Stacy are gone. >> Who is Dreamz more tight
49,00:02:41.67,00:02:41.67,"with? >> I don't know, because he"
50,00:02:45.79,00:02:45.79,doesn't like Stacy at all. >> Welcome home.
51,00:02:59.88,00:02:59.88,">> Voting suck? >> Yeah, it sucked."
52,00:03:10.04,00:03:10.04,>> I guess you could say I'm pretty upset right now.
53,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,"Earlier on, Dreamz and I had a conversation of exactly going"
54,00:03:15.29,00:03:15.29,"back to the original plan that we had, that we would take out"
55,00:03:17.88,00:03:17.88,Stacy. But Dreamz still votes off
56,00:03:20.17,00:03:20.17,Michelle. We just basically gave all the
57,00:03:22.08,00:03:22.08,"power to Alex. You know, we just basically"
58,00:03:24.08,00:03:24.08,screwed ourselves. >> I made it very clear I that
59,00:03:29.25,00:03:29.25,"was voting for Michelle. I thought you were, like, doing"
60,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,your own thing. I was like...
61,00:03:33.08,00:03:33.08,">> No. >> Okay, that's fine."
62,00:03:34.79,00:03:34.79,"It's just miscommunication. But listen, the way to seal the"
63,00:03:38.29,00:03:38.29,final four in blood is to take the immunity idol and rotate it.
64,00:03:41.79,00:03:41.79,"Each of us gets it a day, and that way..."
65,00:03:44.12,00:03:44.12,">> That does nothing. >> It does, dude."
66,00:03:46.29,00:03:46.29,It does. >> It doesn't do anything.
67,00:03:48.12,00:03:48.12,">> It does. It does, Mookie."
68,00:03:50.12,00:03:50.12,Because what it tells me and tells everybody is that none of
69,00:03:52.00,00:03:52.00,"us can screw each other over. If I... look, the three of us"
70,00:03:54.25,00:03:54.25,"found it together. You started digging in one area,"
71,00:03:56.38,00:03:56.38,I pointed to another area. We were all digging.
72,00:03:58.96,00:03:58.96,You happened to be the first one to touch it.
73,00:04:01.33,00:04:01.33,And now you're telling me you're not going to part with it unless
74,00:04:04.29,00:04:04.29,"only on your terms. That's messed up, dude."
75,00:04:07.25,00:04:07.25,>> I'm not saying that. >> That's exactly what you're
76,00:04:09.08,00:04:09.08,saying. You're saying something
77,00:04:10.58,00:04:10.58,"different? Be honest, man."
78,00:04:13.88,00:04:13.88,>> You know what? What's going to happen now is
79,00:04:17.25,00:04:17.25,"Alex is like, ""You know what? You have to trust us, and we're"
80,00:04:19.50,00:04:19.50,each going to share the immunity idol.
81,00:04:21.29,00:04:21.29,"We're going to hold it once every day."""
82,00:04:26.29,00:04:26.29,"Then he's like, ""Four Horsemen is nothing."""
83,00:04:29.00,00:04:29.00,"No we can't. No we don't, because they don't"
84,00:04:31.92,00:04:31.92,trust us. This is what just... you screwed
85,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,everything with that. >> When we got to tribal
86,00:04:37.67,00:04:37.67,"council, Michelle start talking. And when she says in the tribal"
87,00:04:40.12,00:04:40.12,"council, ""I don't know Dre, I never hung around him,"""
88,00:04:44.42,00:04:44.42,"it kind of let me know, ""Wait a minute, I don't know her"
89,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,neither. I don't know what alliance she's
90,00:04:48.21,00:04:48.21,"in."" So it kind of scared me a little"
91,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,"bit, so it caused me to vote her name."
92,00:04:51.71,00:04:51.71,"If she never said that, she'd still be here right now."
93,00:04:54.79,00:04:54.79,">> You did, trust me. Don't worry about it."
94,00:04:57.29,00:04:57.29,Trust me. You just screwed both of us.
95,00:05:42.71,00:05:42.71,">> Well, the tribe, the other half returned from tribal"
96,00:05:45.38,00:05:45.38,"council, and I was hoping that Stacy was gone."
97,00:05:51.17,00:05:51.17,"It was definitely a shock. I was very disappointed, and"
98,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,that just flipped the whole script around for everything in
99,00:05:57.42,00:05:57.42,my head. >> If you all want to take me in
100,00:06:01.96,00:06:01.96,"as a swing vote we'll make it to the five with me, you,"
101,00:06:05.08,00:06:05.08,"Cassandra, Yau-- because I know you're tight with Yau, Yau's a"
102,00:06:08.71,00:06:08.71,"solid, solid, person-- and Dreamz."
103,00:06:12.12,00:06:12.12,"The rest of them, they're all backstabbers."
104,00:06:14.83,00:06:14.83,">> I think ... I mean, as long as we take out Alex first."
105,00:06:19.38,00:06:19.38,">> That's fine with me, but the thing is Dreamz is not going to"
106,00:06:22.42,00:06:22.42,want to take Alex out. >> You think Dreamz is not going
107,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,to want to take Alex out? >> He likes Alex.
108,00:06:27.08,00:06:27.08,>> When Boo and I had our man- to-man talk and looked each
109,00:06:30.08,00:06:30.08,"other in the eye and said he was with me, I still"
110,00:06:32.21,00:06:32.21,didn't buy it. Boo is just trying to save his
111,00:06:35.00,00:06:35.00,own neck at all times. But I need to know if he's with
112,00:06:37.75,00:06:37.75,"us. I mean, because we really need"
113,00:06:39.50,00:06:39.50,his vote since we don't have Michelle.
114,00:06:41.92,00:06:41.92,"That should go a few hours. Basically, the main core is"
115,00:06:48.04,00:06:48.04,"myself, Yau, and Cassandra. I trust them completely."
116,00:06:52.12,00:06:52.12,Dreamz is definitely a wild card and I don't know if I trust
117,00:06:56.25,00:06:56.25,"Mookie all the way yet, because he's already kind of... tries to"
118,00:06:59.25,00:06:59.25,manipulate a lot as well. It's that part of the chess game
119,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,"where you've already lost a couple of really good pieces,"
120,00:07:06.25,00:07:06.25,and now you have to really think.
121,00:07:08.54,00:07:08.54,You can't trust everybody. But I like playing this game.
122,00:07:10.88,00:07:10.88,And I am still here. >> PROBST: You guys ready to get
123,00:07:25.12,00:07:25.12,to today's challenge? >> Yeah.
124,00:07:27.17,00:07:27.17,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, we're going to test"
125,00:07:29.17,00:07:29.17,how in tune are you with the rest of your tribe.
126,00:07:33.17,00:07:33.17,I have a series of questions. Each of you are going to answer
127,00:07:36.00,00:07:36.00,"these questions in private. I'll tally the results, then"
128,00:07:38.92,00:07:38.92,I'll explain the challenge. Let's go.
129,00:07:50.00,00:07:50.00,"Okay, I have tallied the results."
130,00:07:52.29,00:07:52.29,"Now I'm going ask you these same questions again, only this time"
131,00:07:55.00,00:07:55.00,"you're trying to guess what the group said-- in other words,"
132,00:07:58.62,00:07:58.62,whose name came up the most often.
133,00:08:01.92,00:08:01.92,That may differ from what you wrote down.
134,00:08:04.21,00:08:04.21,You're looking to match the group consensus.
135,00:08:07.71,00:08:07.71,"Each time you get it right, you get to smash another tribe"
136,00:08:10.54,00:08:10.54,"member's tower. When your three towers are gone,"
137,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,you're out of the challenge. The last person left standing
138,00:08:16.00,00:08:16.00,wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
139,00:08:18.25,00:08:18.25,for? The winner of this challenge
140,00:08:20.17,00:08:20.17,will spend the night on a 70-foot luxury yacht.
141,00:08:23.79,00:08:23.79,>> Whoo! All right!
142,00:08:26.38,00:08:26.38,>> PROBST: You'll have a snack and cocktail when you get on
143,00:08:28.33,00:08:28.33,"board, a nice barbecue. You'll spend the night on the"
144,00:08:31.17,00:08:31.17,"yacht in a comfortable bed. In addition, the winner of this"
145,00:08:33.96,00:08:33.96,challenge will send one person to Exile Island.
146,00:08:37.21,00:08:37.21,Worth playing for? >> Yeah.
147,00:08:39.21,00:08:39.21,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: We'll get started.
148,00:08:45.25,00:08:45.25,"All right, so remember, you're looking to match the consensus"
149,00:08:48.25,00:08:48.25,as a group whose name came up the most often.
150,00:08:51.38,00:08:51.38,First question-- who would you trust with your life?
151,00:08:57.17,00:08:57.17,Reveal. The answer most commonly given
152,00:09:02.21,00:09:02.21,by the group was Earl. Yau-Man got it right.
153,00:09:06.17,00:09:06.17,Cassandra got it right. And Boo got it right.
154,00:09:09.25,00:09:09.25,Cassandra drew the strike first. You're up.
155,00:09:12.08,00:09:12.08,">> Just random, anybody? >> PROBST: It's not random."
156,00:09:15.08,00:09:15.08,"Your reason, your choice. You're giving somebody their"
157,00:09:18.96,00:09:18.96,"first blow in this game. With force, Cassandra gives"
158,00:09:23.12,00:09:23.12,Stacy her first knock. Boo is not wasting any time.
159,00:09:28.46,00:09:28.46,"Knocks out Stacy's second tower. Yau-Man, you're up."
160,00:09:34.08,00:09:34.08,"Just like that, Stacy is out of this challenge."
161,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,Have a seat on the bench. Next question-- who are you
162,00:09:41.67,00:09:41.67,least likely to invite to a family dinner?
163,00:09:49.25,00:09:49.25,Everybody reveal. Correct answer-- Boo.
164,00:09:54.42,00:09:54.42,>> Wow. >> PROBST: Cassandra got it
165,00:09:56.50,00:09:56.50,"right, Mookie got it right, Dreamz got it right, and Alex"
166,00:09:58.29,00:09:58.29,"got it right. Mookie, you're up."
167,00:10:04.83,00:10:04.83,Will we have a repeat? Will we have a second person
168,00:10:10.50,00:10:10.50,knocked out? Boo is out of the challenge.
169,00:10:16.21,00:10:16.21,Once again Cassandra gets to hit.
170,00:10:19.08,00:10:19.08,And knocks out Alex's first tower.
171,00:10:22.62,00:10:22.62,Next question-- who most has a sense of entitlement?
172,00:10:28.58,00:10:28.58,Everybody reveal. The group felt Alex.
173,00:10:33.33,00:10:33.33,Cassandra got it right. Mookie got it right.
174,00:10:36.50,00:10:36.50,"Cassandra, you're up. Cassandra going right back to"
175,00:10:40.42,00:10:40.42,Alex. Alex now down to his last tower.
176,00:10:46.04,00:10:46.04,Mookie smashes Earl's first tower.
177,00:10:50.33,00:10:50.33,Next question-- who would you most like to be stranded on an
178,00:10:53.08,00:10:53.08,island with? Whose name came up the most
179,00:10:57.04,00:10:57.04,often? Everybody reveal.
180,00:11:01.46,00:11:01.46,The correct answer is Yau-Man. Everybody got it right except
181,00:11:05.75,00:11:05.75,Alex. There is going to be some damage
182,00:11:08.58,00:11:08.58,"done in this round. Earl, you're up first."
183,00:11:13.00,00:11:13.00,Earl nonchalant. Payback has begun.
184,00:11:16.62,00:11:16.62,Mookie back to Earl. Dreamz heads to Alex.
185,00:11:21.08,00:11:21.08,Alex is out of this challenge. Edgardo gives Earl a little
186,00:11:25.88,00:11:25.88,what's up and takes him out of the challenge.
187,00:11:29.25,00:11:29.25,Yau-Man heads to Edgardo. Cassandra knocks Mookie's
188,00:11:34.04,00:11:34.04,"second tower out. Okay, Earl and Alex are out of"
189,00:11:37.54,00:11:37.54,the challenge. Take a seat on the bench.
190,00:11:40.08,00:11:40.08,Who do you not want to see again after the game?
191,00:11:43.88,00:11:43.88,Everybody reveal. Everybody said Stacy.
192,00:11:49.96,00:11:49.96,Correct answer was Stacy. Dreamz surveying the field.
193,00:11:56.79,00:11:56.79,Who's going to get his love? Edgardo heading directly to
194,00:12:02.08,00:12:02.08,Yau-Man's towers. Yau-Man getting even with
195,00:12:08.08,00:12:08.08,Dreamz. Mookie going to pay Cassandra
196,00:12:11.92,00:12:11.92,back for her last hit. Cassandra takes Mookie out of
197,00:12:15.67,00:12:15.67,the game. Next question-- who smells the
198,00:12:19.71,00:12:19.71,worst? Out of all the people left in
199,00:12:23.29,00:12:23.29,"this game, who smells the worst? Everybody reveal."
200,00:12:27.62,00:12:27.62,Edgardo thinks he smells the worse.
201,00:12:30.12,00:12:30.12,Yau-Man thinks Stacy smells the worst.
202,00:12:32.50,00:12:32.50,Cassandra and Dreamz think Dreamz smells the worst.
203,00:12:35.88,00:12:35.88,Dreamz is nodding. He knows.
204,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17,It is Dreamz. Cassandra got it right.
205,00:12:40.17,00:12:40.17,And Dreamz got it right. Cassandra knocks Yau-Man out of
206,00:12:44.25,00:12:44.25,"the game. Just like that, Edgardo down to"
207,00:12:49.04,00:12:49.04,his last tower. Next question-- who mistakenly
208,00:12:52.38,00:12:52.38,believes they are in control of this game?
209,00:12:59.33,00:12:59.33,Everybody reveal. The group felt Alex was the
210,00:13:03.67,00:13:03.67,person who mistakenly believed they were in control of this
211,00:13:06.25,00:13:06.25,game. Cassandra is right.
212,00:13:09.21,00:13:09.21,Make your move. Edgardo's out of the game.
213,00:13:13.58,00:13:13.58,He takes a spot on the bench. We are down to two.
214,00:13:18.17,00:13:18.17,Both have two towers left. Who has wasted this great
215,00:13:22.12,00:13:22.12,opportunity? Everybody reveal.
216,00:13:28.21,00:13:28.21,Correct answer is Stacy. Cassandra got it right.
217,00:13:32.17,00:13:32.17,Make your move. Cassandra knocks Dreamz's whole
218,00:13:38.25,00:13:38.25,name off the board. >> Not so hard.
219,00:13:41.21,00:13:41.21,>> PROBST: Dreamz down to his last tower.
220,00:13:43.42,00:13:43.42,"Cassandra get this right, she wins the challenge."
221,00:13:46.83,00:13:46.83,"Athletically, who out here has surprised you the most in terms"
222,00:13:50.08,00:13:50.08,of their athleticism? Reveal.
223,00:13:54.67,00:13:54.67,Dreamz says Cassandra. Dreamz is wrong.
224,00:13:59.54,00:13:59.54,Cassandra says Yau-Man. Cassandra is right.
225,00:14:04.50,00:14:04.50,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Take your last hit.
226,00:14:08.33,00:14:08.33,"And with that, Cassandra wins this challenge."
227,00:14:13.50,00:14:13.50,Not one question wrong. Nice job.
228,00:14:16.67,00:14:16.67,First order of business will not be fun.
229,00:14:19.21,00:14:19.21,You're sending one person to Exile Island.
230,00:14:21.58,00:14:21.58,They will stay there until the next immunity challenge.
231,00:14:24.04,00:14:24.04,Who are you going send off? >> Mookie.
232,00:14:27.96,00:14:27.96,">> PROBST: Mookie, going back to Exile Island."
233,00:14:30.96,00:14:30.96,The boat will pick you up. Head on down to the water.
234,00:14:39.25,00:14:39.25,"All right, next part of this reward's a little more fun."
235,00:14:41.58,00:14:41.58,Here is your boarding pass to your yacht.
236,00:14:45.21,00:14:45.21,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: We'll pick you up at
237,00:14:47.25,00:14:47.25,camp. You'll return to camp in the
238,00:14:48.96,00:14:48.96,"morning, refreshed, some good food in your belly."
239,00:14:51.04,00:14:51.04,Here are three more boarding passes.
240,00:14:53.62,00:14:53.62,You are going to decide which three people join you on this
241,00:14:56.96,00:14:56.96,"reward, and you're going to do it when you get back to your"
242,00:14:59.04,00:14:59.04,camp. >> Okay.
243,00:15:02.08,00:15:02.08,">> I'll lick your feet, man. >> PROBST: Some negotiating to"
244,00:15:04.25,00:15:04.25,be had. >> Uh-huh.
245,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,">> PROBST: All right, guys, grab your stuff."
246,00:15:07.88,00:15:07.88,Head on back to camp. >> I am very irritated with
247,00:15:26.58,00:15:26.58,Cassandra. She just sent me to Exile
248,00:15:28.79,00:15:28.79,"Island. Cassandra is quiet, but in a"
249,00:15:37.67,00:15:37.67,"deceiving, conniving way. She just made the worst mistake"
250,00:15:40.21,00:15:40.21,"of her life. Given the clues, there has to be"
251,00:15:49.04,00:15:49.04,two idols. The Moto tribe members get the
252,00:15:51.21,00:15:51.21,same exact clues as the Ravu members.
253,00:15:53.25,00:15:53.25,"I mean, if you couldn't find this on the third clue, you must"
254,00:15:56.04,00:15:56.04,be stupid. Worthless.
255,00:15:58.46,00:15:58.46,"Earl came to Exile Island about five, six times."
256,00:16:01.00,00:16:01.00,Most likely Earl found the other one.
257,00:16:03.25,00:16:03.25,I'm 99% sure that Earl has the immunity idol.
258,00:16:06.79,00:16:06.79,Smart guy. All I want to do is take out
259,00:16:10.83,00:16:10.83,"Cassandra and her alliance, period."
260,00:16:13.58,00:16:13.58,"Call it revenge, but I'm gunning for her."
261,00:16:15.38,00:16:15.38,"I just have to get in touch with the Four Horsemen, and it's"
262,00:16:17.25,00:16:17.25,done. >> Cassandra back in high
263,00:16:24.83,00:16:24.83,school. The most popular girl
264,00:16:26.33,00:16:26.33,"again. >> I just won my first reward,"
265,00:16:29.46,00:16:29.46,"first time on a yacht, and I had a chance to take three people."
266,00:16:32.58,00:16:32.58,Dreamz you may as well come up. >> What number?
267,00:16:39.17,00:16:39.17,">> Boo, come on up. >> Oh, yes!"
268,00:16:41.62,00:16:41.62,>> Basically my strategy was to choose people that I needed to
269,00:16:44.88,00:16:44.88,"form an alliance with. Dreamz and Boo, I wasn't sure"
270,00:16:47.62,00:16:47.62,"where they stood. Of course, it just gets tougher"
271,00:16:50.25,00:16:50.25,"as I narrow it down. Oh, god."
272,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,This is hard. Wow.
273,00:16:56.25,00:16:56.25,"I mean, Yau-Man, would you join me?"
274,00:16:58.71,00:16:58.71,>> Thank you. >> And then the last one was
275,00:17:01.79,00:17:01.79,Yau-Man. I just think Yau-Man works so
276,00:17:03.96,00:17:03.96,"hard, and he needed a break. >> De plane!"
277,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,">> Hey, let's go, y'all. They're honking for us."
278,00:17:10.21,00:17:10.21,>> De plane! De plane!
279,00:17:20.67,00:17:20.67,">> Oh, yeah! >> Welcome on board."
280,00:17:23.17,00:17:23.17,">> Well, thank you very much. The first thing I saw on the"
281,00:17:25.71,00:17:25.71,"yacht was cheese and crackers and olives, just an amazing"
282,00:17:29.71,00:17:29.71,spread. That's when it really started
283,00:17:32.12,00:17:32.12,"hitting me-- I just won. Boo, you want a margarita?"
284,00:17:36.25,00:17:36.25,">> Yeah, I want a margarita! >> I felt like ""Welcome to the"
285,00:17:38.62,00:17:38.62,"lifestyle of the rich and famous."""
286,00:17:41.29,00:17:41.29,>> Champagne for you two. I'll pass them over.
287,00:17:45.96,00:17:45.96,">> Cling-cling, cling-cling. >> Boo, you're solidly with us."
288,00:17:49.38,00:17:49.38,">> Man, I am solidly... >> Part of our syndicate."
289,00:17:55.21,00:17:55.21,"And, Dreamz, the syndicate. >> From day one."
290,00:17:59.42,00:17:59.42,>> Let's not make any more mistakes.
291,00:18:02.33,00:18:02.33,Let's proceed carefully. We'll go all the way.
292,00:18:04.92,00:18:04.92,">> It was hardball yesterday. I was like, ""Ooh!"""
293,00:18:07.79,00:18:07.79,">> There's a lot of work to be done on Dreamz, a little bit"
294,00:18:10.12,00:18:10.12,"more, so we can be absolutely sure we have him on our side."
295,00:18:13.08,00:18:13.08,"And this is a way for to us to solidify it-- feed him, get him"
296,00:18:17.25,00:18:17.25,"away from everybody. Just brainwash him, basically."
297,00:18:26.25,00:18:26.25,Cheers. >> Cheers.
298,00:18:28.58,00:18:28.58,>> So we're all straight with our alliance?
299,00:18:31.54,00:18:31.54,>> Uh-huh. Without a doubt.
300,00:18:35.12,00:18:35.12,>> The next one to go is Alex. >> Uh-huh.
301,00:18:37.92,00:18:37.92,He's playing a Harvard graduate game.
302,00:18:40.21,00:18:40.21,He's playing hardball. I think Dreamz is playing both
303,00:18:43.38,00:18:43.38,"sides right now, because I can't sense in his eyes 100%"
304,00:18:46.42,00:18:46.42,"commitment to our alliance, so I don't know what the future is"
305,00:18:50.04,00:18:50.04,"going to be for us with Dreamz. >> Firecrackers, Joe."
306,00:18:59.21,00:18:59.21,>> I'm the swing vote that's stuck between the two alliances.
307,00:19:02.96,00:19:02.96,Mookie' plan was to stick with the old plan and go with the
308,00:19:05.83,00:19:05.83,four boys and Stacy. But my heart telling me go with
309,00:19:08.62,00:19:08.62,"Cassandra, Earl, and Yau-Man and Boo."
310,00:19:13.46,00:19:13.46,"So it's like, so much information going on that it's"
311,00:19:16.75,00:19:16.75,"clogging my mind, and I don't know what to do right now."
312,00:19:18.67,00:19:18.67,It's like I'm being tugged in every direction except my own.
313,00:19:36.25,00:19:36.25,">> Alex, man, they're going to use your name."
314,00:19:38.75,00:19:38.75,They'll probably put your name in the pot tomorrow.
315,00:19:42.79,00:19:42.79,Your name is going to come up tomorrow.
316,00:19:45.12,00:19:45.12,"Man, we messed up. >> That's the thing."
317,00:19:50.00,00:19:50.00,What about Mookie? If Mookie don't give you the
318,00:19:52.25,00:19:52.25,idol... You haven't seen Lord of the
319,00:19:56.25,00:19:56.25,"Rings?"" When they get the ring, like,"
320,00:20:00.12,00:20:00.12,"""My precious..."" >> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
321,00:20:02.08,00:20:02.08,Gollum. >> Yeah.
322,00:20:04.58,00:20:04.58,He's getting like that. >> I understand.
323,00:20:06.42,00:20:06.42,But I don't want to get knocked out.
324,00:20:08.12,00:20:08.12,">> Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying."
325,00:20:10.08,00:20:10.08,I don't want you to get knocked out.
326,00:20:11.92,00:20:11.92,>> Can we get the pot? We need the pot.
327,00:20:14.25,00:20:14.25,">> Oh, you guys need the pot? >> You guys are gone forever,"
328,00:20:17.25,00:20:17.25,and we don't have that much wood.
329,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,There is a major part of me that wants to let Dreamz go.
330,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,"You know, right now I'm trying to keep it personal between us,"
331,00:20:26.54,00:20:26.54,"but if you keep on fraternizing with the people that, you know,"
332,00:20:30.46,00:20:30.46,"we're talking about getting rid of, then, you know, you're going"
333,00:20:32.62,00:20:32.62,to have to get cut. >> Who's going?
334,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,">> You know... >> No, just say it."
335,00:20:37.58,00:20:37.58,">> Earl, I mean, he was... he's not doubting you."
336,00:20:39.75,00:20:39.75,>> It hurt my feelings when you just said that.
337,00:20:42.12,00:20:42.12,">> No. >> Come here, Earl."
338,00:20:44.46,00:20:44.46,">> No, let me talk to you. >> Let me talk to you."
339,00:20:46.71,00:20:46.71,Cassandra told me that you're... >> I said we're not sure what
340,00:20:50.21,00:20:50.21,camp you're in and we need to know that you're firm on our
341,00:20:52.46,00:20:52.46,side. >> You know I heard what y'all
342,00:20:54.58,00:20:54.58,"were saying, right? You know I was standing there."
343,00:20:56.58,00:20:56.58,">> Yeah, yeah. That's the whole thing."
344,00:20:58.54,00:20:58.54,"What did we say? Earl, I can tell by the way"
345,00:21:02.04,00:21:02.04,you're looking at me that you're doubting me.
346,00:21:03.88,00:21:03.88,>> This is one thing you need to start doing a little bit more.
347,00:21:05.67,00:21:05.67,>> You don't see the show enough.
348,00:21:07.21,00:21:07.21,"You don't see the show enough to strategize, because I can tell"
349,00:21:09.04,00:21:09.04,you ain't strategizing. >> I'm someone you need to
350,00:21:11.00,00:21:11.00,"listen to more, because I notice that you talk over us."
351,00:21:13.00,00:21:13.00,"Now, we have agreed on this. >> Mookie's got the immunity"
352,00:21:15.17,00:21:15.17,"idol. Yes, Mookie has found the"
353,00:21:18.50,00:21:18.50,immunity idol. Mookie's got the idol.
354,00:21:21.08,00:21:21.08,>> He told you he had it? >> I seen the idol.
355,00:21:23.38,00:21:23.38,>> What did it look like? >> It's a turtle.
356,00:21:25.46,00:21:25.46,>> It's a turtle? >> It's a little turtle
357,00:21:27.38,00:21:27.38,necklace. >> A turtle necklace?
358,00:21:30.62,00:21:30.62,>> Yeah. >> So he has the idol?
359,00:21:33.08,00:21:33.08,>> He has the idol. >> Mm-hmm.
360,00:21:36.71,00:21:36.71,>> Why are you just now telling me this about this idol?
361,00:21:39.21,00:21:39.21,I didn't even know anybody had it from over there.
362,00:21:41.54,00:21:41.54,I should have been knowing that. >> Mookie's got it.
363,00:21:45.92,00:21:45.92,">> Dreamz, his problem is he's trying to do a lot of strategy"
364,00:21:48.75,00:21:48.75,"on his own, and, yes, it can be effective, but if you don't tell"
365,00:21:51.54,00:21:51.54,"people what you're doing, I'm sorry, I'm just not going to"
366,00:21:54.75,00:21:54.75,"trust anybody, especially someone that, you know, has all"
367,00:21:58.67,00:21:58.67,"these little antics and things about them that, you know, I"
368,00:22:01.12,00:22:01.12,still kind of question anyway. >> Homebody keep asking Mookie
369,00:22:03.17,00:22:03.17,about the idol. >> He told everybody he has the
370,00:22:05.08,00:22:05.08,"idol? >> Yeah, him and Alex got the"
371,00:22:07.58,00:22:07.58,idol. >> They found it together?
372,00:22:09.58,00:22:09.58,>> Yes. >> They didn't fight over it?
373,00:22:11.33,00:22:11.33,>> No. >> There are two hidden immunity
374,00:22:14.38,00:22:14.38,idols. The one over here in the Moto
375,00:22:18.04,00:22:18.04,camp was dug up by me. Dreamz revealed that Mookie
376,00:22:22.79,00:22:22.79,actually have the immunity idol from Ravu island.
377,00:22:26.50,00:22:26.50,"The fact that Mookie have it made me very nervous, and not"
378,00:22:29.50,00:22:29.50,"only that, the other two crucial members, Edgardo and Alex, also"
379,00:22:32.71,00:22:32.71,know he has it. I have to rethink how this will
380,00:22:35.46,00:22:35.46,"play out. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
381,00:22:49.50,00:22:49.50,"We'll now bring in Mookie, returning from Exile Island."
382,00:22:56.50,00:22:56.50,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
383,00:22:58.21,00:22:58.21,>> Yep. >> PROBST: First things first.
384,00:23:00.12,00:23:00.12,Give it up. Tribal immunity is no more.
385,00:23:07.38,00:23:07.38,Individual immunity is what you covet.
386,00:23:11.25,00:23:11.25,"You have this around your neck, you cannot be voted out."
387,00:23:14.25,00:23:14.25,Shall we get to the challenge? >> Yeah.
388,00:23:17.00,00:23:17.00,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: For today's challenge
389,00:23:20.21,00:23:20.21,you are going to use your arms to brace between two walls while
390,00:23:24.04,00:23:24.04,your feet are positioned on very narrow footholds.
391,00:23:27.92,00:23:27.92,"Every 30 minutes, you'll step down to an even smaller"
392,00:23:31.08,00:23:31.08,"foothold, making it more difficult."
393,00:23:33.54,00:23:33.54,"When you reach the third and final foothold, you will stay"
394,00:23:35.88,00:23:35.88,"there for as long as you can. When you fall off, you're out."
395,00:23:39.21,00:23:39.21,"Big rules-- no hips, no back, no butt."
396,00:23:42.21,00:23:42.21,Arms and feet only. Last person left standing wins
397,00:23:45.12,00:23:45.12,immunity. Losers go to tribal council.
398,00:23:47.29,00:23:47.29,Somebody will be going home. Take your spots.
399,00:23:49.42,00:23:49.42,We'll get started. This challenge is officially
400,00:23:59.29,00:23:59.29,"underway. Day 27, another hot one."
401,00:24:25.21,00:24:25.21,Not a bit of breeze out here. Edgardo looks like he could go
402,00:24:37.96,00:24:37.96,all day. Mookie looks like he might be
403,00:24:40.42,00:24:40.42,asleep he's so comfortable. >> Ouch!
404,00:24:48.08,00:24:48.08,>> PROBST: Cassandra steps down. She's the first person out of
405,00:24:49.96,00:24:49.96,the challenge. Take a spot on the bench.
406,00:25:03.88,00:25:03.88,( drumming ) >> Meke!
407,00:25:10.29,00:25:10.29,"Voodoo. >> Oh, man!"
408,00:25:19.42,00:25:19.42,">> PROBST: Out of nowhere, Edgardo slips off."
409,00:25:22.54,00:25:22.54,And then there were seven. The foothold you're standing on
410,00:25:26.08,00:25:26.08,"now, less than an inch wide. By the time you get to the"
411,00:25:28.92,00:25:28.92,"bottom, less than a quarter inch."
412,00:25:33.17,00:25:33.17,"Okay, you've been up there 30 minutes."
413,00:25:36.12,00:25:36.12,It is time to move down one foothold.
414,00:25:39.21,00:25:39.21,Everybody move. You are now sitting on a
415,00:25:43.25,00:25:43.25,foothold less than a half an inch wide.
416,00:25:46.08,00:25:46.08,Mookie looks like a fixed piece of art.
417,00:25:50.67,00:25:50.67,"Mookie slips off, but recovers. Earl..."
418,00:25:54.46,00:25:54.46,>> Slipped. >> PROBST: ...slipped.
419,00:25:57.04,00:25:57.04,Earl is the third person out of this challenge.
420,00:25:59.25,00:25:59.25,"Who is the odds-on favorite now, Earl?"
421,00:26:06.21,00:26:06.21,>> Stacy. >> PROBST: Cassandra?
422,00:26:08.21,00:26:08.21,>> Stacy. >> PROBST: Edgardo?
423,00:26:10.08,00:26:10.08,">> What I would say right now by looking at everybody, Stacy."
424,00:26:18.92,00:26:18.92,>> PROBST: Mookie the fourth person out of this challenge.
425,00:26:27.92,00:26:27.92,Five of you have lasted one hour.
426,00:26:30.75,00:26:30.75,Everybody step down. You'll be standing on less than
427,00:26:32.67,00:26:32.67,a quarter inch of wood. Dreamz struggling.
428,00:26:41.25,00:26:41.25,"Alex drops out. We are now down to Boo, Dreamz,"
429,00:26:47.21,00:26:47.21,"Stacy, and Yau Man. Dreamz is out of the challenge."
430,00:26:52.79,00:26:52.79,And we are now down to three people left.
431,00:27:13.12,00:27:13.12,">> PROBST: After an hour and 15 minutes, Stacy is out of the"
432,00:27:15.38,00:27:15.38,challenge. >> Ooh-wee!
433,00:27:20.71,00:27:20.71,>> PROBST: Boo with a very nice recovery.
434,00:27:23.96,00:27:23.96,"Boo almost loses it, and saves himself again."
435,00:27:27.71,00:27:27.71,>> How many lives does that guy have?
436,00:27:30.88,00:27:30.88,>> PROBST: Boo slipping again and hanging in there.
437,00:27:36.71,00:27:36.71,Boo struggling to recover. >> Oh!
438,00:27:41.04,00:27:41.04,>> PROBST: Yau-Man wins first individual immunity.
439,00:27:44.08,00:27:44.08,>> I'm sure I could stay another hour.
440,00:27:46.17,00:27:46.17,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, come on over."
441,00:27:52.17,00:27:52.17,"Congratulations. Yau-Man, safe tonight at the"
442,00:27:54.54,00:27:54.54,vote. One of you is going home
443,00:27:56.88,00:27:56.88,"tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to"
444,00:27:59.00,00:27:59.00,"camp. >> All right, it will bring good"
445,00:28:17.33,00:28:17.33,luck to everybody. >> By Cassandra sending me to
446,00:28:25.29,00:28:25.29,Exile Island she ruined the game for herself and her alliance.
447,00:28:27.38,00:28:27.38,I am going to take out her whole alliance one by one.
448,00:28:37.04,00:28:37.04,Knowing that Earl potentially has the idol does change the
449,00:28:40.25,00:28:40.25,game a little bit in terms of strategy.
450,00:28:42.75,00:28:42.75,"You want to get the guy with the immunity idol, and get him by"
451,00:28:44.83,00:28:44.83,surprise. And hopefully we can take him
452,00:28:47.58,00:28:47.58,"out, and take him out with the immunity idol, and he won't use"
453,00:28:49.50,00:28:49.50,"it. >> Hey, look-- I trust you guys."
454,00:28:52.12,00:28:52.12,You're my best bet. >> When I was on Exile Island I
455,00:28:55.67,00:28:55.67,"committed myself to that. I'm like, ""I will not be"
456,00:28:57.92,00:28:57.92,faltered. I will not be wavered by
457,00:28:59.79,00:28:59.79,"anybody."" This is the order that we're"
458,00:29:01.79,00:29:01.79,"sticking with-- Earl, Yau Man, Boo."
459,00:29:04.00,00:29:04.00,It's done. >> It's done.
460,00:29:05.67,00:29:05.67,>> It's done. >> Are you 100% on Stacy?
461,00:29:07.42,00:29:07.42,>> Stacy is with us. She's with us.
462,00:29:10.08,00:29:10.08,>> Are you sure? >> It's so weird.
463,00:29:18.46,00:29:18.46,"We're going go to tribal council, and I have no idea"
464,00:29:20.17,00:29:20.17,what's going on. I have no idea.
465,00:29:34.75,00:29:34.75,>> But it makes no point if I'm the only person that's voting
466,00:29:37.25,00:29:37.25,"for Alex. Okay, as long as I have that"
467,00:29:42.04,00:29:42.04,assurance. Then I'll do that to save myself
468,00:29:47.17,00:29:47.17,then. Are you in?
469,00:30:11.92,00:30:11.92,">> I, of course, want to go with the majority."
470,00:30:14.00,00:30:14.00,So it's who do I trust more at this point in the game?
471,00:30:16.58,00:30:16.58,I don't owe anything to Alex. If saving myself means severing
472,00:30:19.29,00:30:19.29,"a tie, then I'll sever that tie. >> That means she's not in,"
473,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,dude. No.
474,00:30:41.12,00:30:41.12,>> What do you think? I think not.
475,00:30:43.17,00:30:43.17,>> I think... I don't know. I think not.
476,00:30:48.04,00:30:48.04,>> Pretty much. >> You think Mookie is going to
477,00:30:55.92,00:30:55.92,do that? >> That's the thing.
478,00:31:00.46,00:31:00.46,If Stacy comes through today... >> Os to show the immunity idol.
479,00:31:10.08,00:31:10.08,">> Show the immunity idol. All right, well, have that in"
480,00:31:13.21,00:31:13.21,"line, and have that thing ready just in case."
481,00:31:21.00,00:31:21.00,>> My hope was that Stacy would vote with us today to make it
482,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,"5-3, but it seems like she's not voting with us anymore."
483,00:31:27.12,00:31:27.12,I don't want to use the immunity idol this early in the game.
484,00:31:30.83,00:31:30.83,"But at the same time, I have to strategically think about what's"
485,00:31:33.71,00:31:33.71,going to get me the furthest in this game.
486,00:31:36.12,00:31:36.12,"I can save Alex by giving him the immunity idol, but this"
487,00:31:38.62,00:31:38.62,early in the game to use the immunity idol is kind of a
488,00:31:41.12,00:31:41.12,disadvantage. So things have gotten very
489,00:31:43.42,00:31:43.42,"complicated. >> Mook, Mook, Mook, Mook."
490,00:32:49.58,00:32:49.58,">> Turns out that Mookie gave the idol to Alex, so we're going"
491,00:32:53.58,00:32:53.58,to vote Mookie just to catch them off guard.
492,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,">> Dreamz, Alex, Mookie and I are voting for Cassandra."
493,00:33:16.71,00:33:16.71,I think that's the smartest move.
494,00:33:18.67,00:33:18.67,"And also, it will be like... you know, have the hardest punch at"
495,00:33:20.46,00:33:20.46,tribal council. This is an all-or-nothing move.
496,00:33:23.50,00:33:23.50,"But if it works out, it will probably be one of the best"
497,00:33:25.79,00:33:25.79,moves ever. >> I think we should talk about
498,00:33:52.29,00:33:52.29,"it between the five of us. Look, we should do... look, we"
499,00:33:54.04,00:33:54.04,"should do the five of us for Edgardo, and not say anything to"
500,00:33:56.71,00:33:56.71,anybody else. That's it.
501,00:34:07.17,00:34:07.17,>> What's going on now is total chaos.
502,00:34:10.12,00:34:10.12,A lot of people are paranoid. The panic button has been
503,00:34:12.71,00:34:12.71,pushed. Mookie had the idol.
504,00:34:17.33,00:34:17.33,"He actually gave it to Alex. So that was from our source,"
505,00:34:21.17,00:34:21.17,"which is Dreamz, but it could be a test."
506,00:34:25.12,00:34:25.12,"It doesn't matter, because we're smarter than that, so we won't"
507,00:34:27.79,00:34:27.79,vote Alex or Mookie. We're going to vote Edgardo.
508,00:34:30.71,00:34:30.71,">> Alex, Alex. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
509,00:35:32.88,00:35:32.88,"the members of our jury. Rocky, Lisi, and Michelle, voted"
510,00:35:39.62,00:35:39.62,"out at the last tribal council. Okay, Dreamz, was there a mad"
511,00:35:49.25,00:35:49.25,scramble when you got back after the challenge today?
512,00:35:51.88,00:35:51.88,">> Jeff, if you was on that beach, it was chaotic."
513,00:35:54.79,00:35:54.79,"The most chaotic day of any time-- swing pitchers, swing"
514,00:35:59.25,00:35:59.25,"voters, swing hitters. And I'm talking on behalf of"
515,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,everybody. It's the most chaotic day ever.
516,00:36:04.25,00:36:04.25,">> I mean, seriously, right now, I don't even know who the"
517,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,majority is. I'm lost.
518,00:36:08.92,00:36:08.92,"I'm, like, paranoid. I've been paranoid ever since..."
519,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,"I mean, I'm paranoid right now. >> PROBST: Yau-Man, the one"
520,00:36:13.71,00:36:13.71,guy who doesn't have to be paranoid tonight is you.
521,00:36:17.38,00:36:17.38,>> This is the first time I've come to a tribal council meeting
522,00:36:21.46,00:36:21.46,with a regular heart rate and normal blood pressure.
523,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,And that's a good thing for an old man.
524,00:36:28.04,00:36:28.04,">> PROBST: Mookie, so you're gone two days, and you come back"
525,00:36:31.75,00:36:31.75,to the most chaotic day out here.
526,00:36:34.83,00:36:34.83,">> Like Edgardo said, tons of different names coming up."
527,00:36:38.58,00:36:38.58,"I'm thinking I'm one of the people, since I was at Exile."
528,00:36:42.46,00:36:42.46,"I don't know what's going on, either."
529,00:36:44.25,00:36:44.25,But I guess I have to use my own judgment.
530,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, the way the idol plays this season is a"
531,00:36:48.12,00:36:48.12,little different. How does that impact how you
532,00:36:50.75,00:36:50.75,vote? >> If we suspect someone has the
533,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,"idol, we should try to avoid voting for that person and vote"
534,00:36:58.42,00:36:58.42,somebody in his alliance out first.
535,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,There's two ways to defeat an army.
536,00:37:03.62,00:37:03.62,One is to cut off the head. The other is to take away all
537,00:37:05.71,00:37:05.71,"the soldiers. >> PROBST: Alex, how much time"
538,00:37:09.62,00:37:09.62,do you spend thinking about the idol in terms of your strategy?
539,00:37:13.46,00:37:13.46,">> Logically speaking, I'm going to suspect that the people who"
540,00:37:16.83,00:37:16.83,"have been to Exile Island, like Earl, are probably going to have"
541,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,it. So that tells me either avoid
542,00:37:22.12,00:37:22.12,Earl or try to take out people in an Earl's alliance.
543,00:37:27.25,00:37:27.25,">> PROBST: Dreamz, how crazy is this vote going to be tonight?"
544,00:37:29.88,00:37:29.88,>> This vote right here is going to determine everything in the
545,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,game. It's going to separate the
546,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,"snakes and rats right here. >> PROBST: All right, let's get"
547,00:37:37.67,00:37:37.67,"to the vote. First thing, if somebody has the"
548,00:37:39.96,00:37:39.96,"hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, you would"
549,00:37:42.12,00:37:42.12,"present it to me after we voted, but before I read the votes."
550,00:37:45.38,00:37:45.38,"Yau-Man, you have individual immunity."
551,00:37:48.33,00:37:48.33,"You can, of course, give that to somebody if you want to, or you"
552,00:37:50.54,00:37:50.54,can hang on to it. >> I'll hang on to it for
553,00:37:53.42,00:37:53.42,tonight. >> PROBST: Yau-Man is safe.
554,00:37:55.54,00:37:55.54,You cannot vote for Yau-Man tonight.
555,00:37:57.33,00:37:57.33,Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote.
556,00:37:59.79,00:37:59.79,"Alex, you're up. >> A strategic move."
557,00:38:13.67,00:38:13.67,"Let's still be friends. >> Nothing against you, but"
558,00:38:26.38,00:38:26.38,better you than me. Let's see if this works.
559,00:38:48.04,00:38:48.04,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
560,00:39:02.83,00:39:02.83,"Okay, if anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to"
561,00:39:05.21,00:39:05.21,"play it, now is the time to do so."
562,00:39:27.88,00:39:27.88,Alex is playing the hidden immunity idol.
