4,00:00:06.07,00:00:06.07,It sucks to beoutside right now.
5,00:00:07.60,00:00:07.60,PROBST: ...while Jaburu's pitiful shelter
6,00:00:09.47,00:00:09.47,left the women out in the cold.
7,00:00:10.83,00:00:10.83,I can't believehow badly this sucks.
8,00:00:14.93,00:00:14.93,"PROBST: At the reward challenge, the women"
9,00:00:16.47,00:00:16.47,won some much-needed fish bait.

11,00:00:21.60,00:00:21.60," Back at Tambaqui, the men licked their wounds."
12,00:00:23.87,00:00:23.87,DAVE: Everybody wants to win.
13,00:00:25.33,00:00:25.33, Particularly seven guys
14,00:00:26.67,00:00:26.67,don't want to loseto a bunch of girls.
15,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,"PROBST: And at Jaburu,"
16,00:00:29.83,00:00:29.83, the discovery of a granola bar
17,00:00:31.20,00:00:31.20, put Janet in hot water.
18,00:00:32.53,00:00:32.53,JOANNA: Jeanne saw the little candy bar thing
19,00:00:35.53,00:00:35.53,inside of Janet's bag.
20,00:00:36.83,00:00:36.83,"JANET: If you're gonnavote me off, that's fine,"
21,00:00:38.20,00:00:38.20,"as long as it's notfor that reason,"
22,00:00:39.53,00:00:39.53,"because if it is,you're making a mistake."
23,00:00:40.97,00:00:40.97,"PROBST:Jaburu, no score."
24,00:00:42.03,00:00:42.03,The contest is over.
25,00:00:44.10,00:00:44.10,Tambaqui-- immunity.
26,00:00:45.60,00:00:45.60,"-(cheering) -At the immunity challenge,"
27,00:00:47.13,00:00:47.13,"the men finally tasted victory,"
28,00:00:49.47,00:00:49.47," sending the Jaburu women to their first Tribal Council,"
29,00:00:52.47,00:00:52.47, where Janet was the secondperson voted out of the Amazon.
30,00:00:57.13,00:00:57.13, 14 are left.
31,00:00:58.40,00:00:58.40, Who will be voted out tonight?
32,00:02:08.57,00:02:08.57,"(thunder cracks, rumbles)"
33,00:02:09.57,00:02:09.57,"And on the seventh day,the Lord said to rest,"
34,00:02:12.40,00:02:12.40,but that's not us.
35,00:02:21.77,00:02:21.77,"Come on, baby."
36,00:02:24.63,00:02:24.63,That hurt.
37,00:02:26.67,00:02:26.67,"ROB: We had a bad rainstorm yesterday, and we had"
38,00:02:30.47,00:02:30.47," a lot of leaks, and everybody was getting wet,"
39,00:02:33.83,00:02:33.83, and we decided to fix up our roof today.
40,00:02:37.07,00:02:37.07,I can't imaginethat the girls have a shelter
41,00:02:39.93,00:02:39.93,that is comparable to ours.
42,00:02:41.77,00:02:41.77,"Uh, maybe it's more comfortable than ours,"
43,00:02:43.50,00:02:43.50," but we're men, and we just build,"
44,00:02:45.83,00:02:45.83, and we think about comfort later.
45,00:02:47.73,00:02:47.73," Where we want to build an awesome structure,"
46,00:02:50.10,00:02:50.10,"something big to look at,that's what we do."
47,00:02:52.27,00:02:52.27,We're the men.
48,00:02:57.57,00:02:57.57,"Oh, Danny, can you get ussome water?"
49,00:03:00.40,00:03:00.40,Sure.
50,00:03:03.00,00:03:03.00,Can you handle itby yourself or not?
51,00:03:05.07,00:03:05.07,Yeah.
52,00:03:06.53,00:03:06.53,"Okay, when you carry it back,put it on your shoulder."
53,00:03:08.80,00:03:08.80,Are you goingto go with me or what?
54,00:03:10.67,00:03:10.67,"Well, I was goingto go do it myself..."
55,00:03:12.37,00:03:12.37,"I don't, I don't..."
56,00:03:15.07,00:03:15.07,I think if you...
57,00:03:16.60,00:03:16.60,I'll go do it.
58,00:03:24.13,00:03:24.13,(thunder cracks)
59,00:03:41.90,00:03:41.90,"ROGER: Picked up the deal,"
60,00:03:43.50,00:03:43.50," went down myself, and I told him..."
61,00:03:44.77,00:03:44.77, Look at him.
62,00:03:45.90,00:03:45.90, Come on. He's a little Hercules.
63,00:03:47.47,00:03:47.47,"If I can go down and pick upa five-gallon deal,"
64,00:03:49.60,00:03:49.60,"put it on my shoulders,and carry it back up..."
65,00:03:51.50,00:03:51.50, And I real... It really got me hot.
66,00:03:53.47,00:03:53.47," I, um... I had to..."
67,00:03:56.17,00:03:56.17,"I'm tempted to slap the kidaround, to be honest with you."
68,00:04:03.47,00:04:03.47,DANIEL: The-the thing that irritates me about Roger
69,00:04:06.17,00:04:06.17, is that he just barks orders all the time.
70,00:04:08.20,00:04:08.20,"I mean, he's notvery friendly about it."
71,00:04:09.43,00:04:09.43,He just tells people what to do.
72,00:04:11.27,00:04:11.27," Uh, I'm not really speaking to Roger right now."
73,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67," Um, he knows that he wants"
74,00:04:15.03,00:04:15.03," to vote for me, and I know I want to vote for him."
75,00:04:17.83,00:04:17.83," And also, he smells bad."
76,00:04:19.30,00:04:19.30,He smellslike really spoiled vinegar?
77,00:04:22.30,00:04:22.30,Almost...Almost had it out with him.
78,00:04:25.27,00:04:25.27,DAVE:Which one?
79,00:04:26.27,00:04:26.27,Dan. Lazy...
80,00:04:28.40,00:04:28.40, It really pissed me off.
81,00:04:31.27,00:04:31.27, Almost to the point
82,00:04:32.47,00:04:32.47,that I was readyto give him a kung fu chop.
83,00:04:35.20,00:04:35.20,"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
84,00:04:36.90,00:04:36.90,But I'm relaxing. 
85,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80,I'm relaxing.
86,00:04:41.03,00:04:41.03,MATTHEW: It'll be cool.
87,00:04:42.03,00:04:42.03, I think what you should do--
88,00:04:43.77,00:04:43.77,don't let this situationget you down.
89,00:04:46.57,00:04:46.57,"Don't get bummed out about it,even though it's... it's..."
90,00:04:49.07,00:04:49.07,"There's a lot of, uh,bull going on,"
91,00:04:51.73,00:04:51.73,"you know, people still"
92,00:04:53.07,00:04:53.07,jockeying for positionand currying favor.
93,00:04:56.87,00:04:56.87,"Right now, there's stillmomentum to boot Roger."
94,00:04:59.67,00:04:59.67,He's still the prime candidate.
95,00:05:01.07,00:05:01.07,(Matthew speaking Mandarin)
96,00:05:11.67,00:05:11.67, MATTHEW: Daniel and I came together because
97,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10, he speaks Mandarin and Cantonese;
98,00:05:15.50,00:05:15.50, I was born in Hong Kong;
99,00:05:17.77,00:05:17.77," I speak some Mandarin,"
100,00:05:19.37,00:05:19.37,"and we started to speakMandarin together,"
101,00:05:21.53,00:05:21.53,and there wasan immediate connection.
102,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,Physically or what?
103,00:05:41.60,00:05:41.60,-Oh.-Secure.
104,00:05:45.73,00:05:45.73,DANIEL: Matthew and I are great friends.
105,00:05:47.10,00:05:47.10," He's my best friend out here,"
106,00:05:48.10,00:05:48.10, and he's a really good ally.
107,00:05:49.93,00:05:49.93,"When he tells you something,he's being truthful,"
108,00:05:52.00,00:05:52.00,whereas the other guysaround here--
109,00:05:53.37,00:05:53.37,"when they tell you something,you have no idea"
110,00:05:55.23,00:05:55.23,if they're telling the truthor if they're lying.
111,00:06:02.77,00:06:02.77,Mm-hmm.
112,00:06:04.27,00:06:04.27,"All right, dude, let's go back"
113,00:06:06.83,00:06:06.83,"to the, uh, the rat pack."
114,00:06:12.20,00:06:12.20,(squawking)
115,00:06:16.87,00:06:16.87,(insects buzzing)
116,00:06:26.30,00:06:26.30,"JEANNE: This is day seven,"
117,00:06:27.77,00:06:27.77, and our tribe is pretty much pathetic.
118,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43,Definitely the hygieneof the camp right now--
119,00:06:33.20,00:06:33.20,"that's, uh, lacking."
120,00:06:34.83,00:06:34.83,(buzzing)
121,00:06:36.17,00:06:36.17,"I thought they cleaned the pot, but they didn't"
122,00:06:37.77,00:06:37.77," clean it out thoroughly, and there's wasps"
123,00:06:39.53,00:06:39.53,all over the camp this morning.
124,00:06:41.30,00:06:41.30,"Yeah, I'm actuallyallergic to bees,"
125,00:06:43.27,00:06:43.27,so that's why I want to tryto trap them in there.
126,00:06:46.00,00:06:46.00,(buzzing)
127,00:06:49.87,00:06:49.87,(soft groaning)
128,00:06:51.87,00:06:51.87,That's what attractedall those noises last night.
129,00:06:54.97,00:06:54.97,-Tarantula.-Can I see?
130,00:06:56.63,00:06:56.63,DEENA:Holy crappy-oli.
131,00:06:58.53,00:06:58.53,-(chopping in distance)-Give me the knife.
132,00:07:00.67,00:07:00.67,JENNA:What's with our food?
133,00:07:01.80,00:07:01.80,They always want our food.
134,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,-Jeanne!-(laughter)
135,00:07:09.17,00:07:09.17,Sorry.
136,00:07:10.17,00:07:10.17,Spider's dead.
137,00:07:12.57,00:07:12.57,"Oh, that's lovely."
138,00:07:14.60,00:07:14.60,"That would be the nice,fresh smell of mold."
139,00:07:16.93,00:07:16.93,"That needs to come out,that moldy stuff."
140,00:07:24.90,00:07:24.90,What are we doing?
141,00:07:26.73,00:07:26.73,The four of us here--do we have a plan?
142,00:07:30.87,00:07:30.87,"We need wood,and we need fire going."
143,00:07:36.93,00:07:36.93,JEANNE:We've been spinning our wheels.
144,00:07:38.93,00:07:38.93, You can't spin your wheels in the jungle.
145,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,Everyone has their own agenda.
146,00:07:43.20,00:07:43.20,My priority is water.
147,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,See? We have none.
148,00:07:47.00,00:07:47.00,My agenda is food.
149,00:07:49.27,00:07:49.27,And then whatever elsewe have to do-- I have no idea.
150,00:07:51.70,00:07:51.70,"I'm so hungry,I can't even think straight."
151,00:07:53.77,00:07:53.77,We've got girlswho are freezing at night.
152,00:07:55.13,00:07:55.13,"They don't have any shoeson their feet,"
153,00:07:57.30,00:07:57.30,"and there's no firenear the shelter,"
154,00:07:59.27,00:07:59.27,and the shelter over thereis not big enough.
155,00:08:01.33,00:08:01.33,"JEANNE: We got one, two, three, four,"
156,00:08:04.43,00:08:04.43,five different kind of thingsgoing on here.
157,00:08:06.67,00:08:06.67," We promised each other as a tribe, last night,"
158,00:08:08.93,00:08:08.93,that we were going to havea meeting to get our...
159,00:08:11.47,00:08:11.47,things in order.
160,00:08:12.73,00:08:12.73,We all have to call this meetingin order now.
161,00:08:20.67,00:08:20.67,"Shawna, can you make itto a meeting?"
162,00:08:23.40,00:08:23.40,Shawna?
163,00:08:24.50,00:08:24.50,She's sleeping.
164,00:08:25.77,00:08:25.77,"-She's out.-Well, she's part of the tribe."
165,00:08:27.47,00:08:27.47,I'm gonna wake her up.
166,00:08:28.80,00:08:28.80,Hey...
167,00:08:30.43,00:08:30.43,we need to have a meeting.
168,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50,Can you take a...
169,00:08:32.63,00:08:32.63,-SHAWNA: Yeah. -Okay.We're going to go over there.
170,00:08:36.63,00:08:36.63,The meeting is called to order.
171,00:08:40.10,00:08:40.10,"So I think we should, uh, maybe"
172,00:08:43.27,00:08:43.27,initiate a leader.
173,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,"I, um, initiate Deena."
174,00:08:48.83,00:08:48.83,-Anybody...?-Second that? Okay.
175,00:08:50.73,00:08:50.73,"JEANNE: Strategically, Joanna and I decided to put"
176,00:08:54.00,00:08:54.00,Deena up forthe leadership position because
177,00:08:57.13,00:08:57.13," we think she's a little hotheaded,"
178,00:08:58.80,00:08:58.80, and I think she's going to create a little friction.
179,00:09:01.33,00:09:01.33,"Deena, do you accept the offer?"
180,00:09:04.80,00:09:04.80,"You know, I'm going to..."
181,00:09:06.97,00:09:06.97,All I want to do is--we delegate the tasks
182,00:09:09.17,00:09:09.17,-that are important for the day.-SHAWNA: We don't need a leader.
183,00:09:11.27,00:09:11.27,We need a delegator. We needsomeone who's gonna step in
184,00:09:13.33,00:09:13.33,"-and give us some structure.-""Okay, hey, you do that,"
185,00:09:14.87,00:09:14.87,"-you do that""?-DEENA: Nobody wants to step up"
186,00:09:16.67,00:09:16.67,"to be leader, because that puts"
187,00:09:17.90,00:09:17.90,"a big target on your body,"
188,00:09:19.53,00:09:19.53,and who wants to get votedout of the game?
189,00:09:22.07,00:09:22.07," I didn't take that with open arms,"
190,00:09:23.43,00:09:23.43," but, yes, I am going to do it."
191,00:09:24.97,00:09:24.97, I am going to delegate tasks.
192,00:09:26.07,00:09:26.07, I told them that that was my goal.
193,00:09:27.83,00:09:27.83,"Okay,we're a little bit raggedy."
194,00:09:29.83,00:09:29.83,"-We're okay. -HEIDI: You knowwhat's impressive,"
195,00:09:31.73,00:09:31.73,"is that we live like this,"
196,00:09:33.57,00:09:33.57,and we've wontwo out of three things.
197,00:09:35.07,00:09:35.07,"-(laughter)-I mean, really."
198,00:09:36.33,00:09:36.33, This group is such a good group.
199,00:09:37.83,00:09:37.83," When it, when it comes time to pull your butt together"
200,00:09:40.97,00:09:40.97,"and say, hey, what..."
201,00:09:42.40,00:09:42.40,"here's the organization we needfor... to win this thing,"
202,00:09:45.20,00:09:45.20, we are such a good group together.
203,00:09:46.47,00:09:46.47,(indistinct talking)
204,00:09:48.07,00:09:48.07," Jaburu is beating Tambaqui,"

412,00:17:09.73,00:17:09.73,which is an exciting prospect.
413,00:17:12.10,00:17:12.10,I had a great time.I finally got to meet Shawna
414,00:17:13.77,00:17:13.77,and I think she digs me.
415,00:17:14.87,00:17:14.87,I can tell by the littletwinkle in her eye
416,00:17:16.60,00:17:16.60,"when I met her, you know."
417,00:17:17.83,00:17:17.83,"ROGER: And the fun I had--honestly, honestly, Alex--"
418,00:17:19.80,00:17:19.80,was to see you guysreact with these women.
419,00:17:21.87,00:17:21.87,"DANIEL: Overall,they seemed pretty nice."
420,00:17:23.00,00:17:23.00,-ROB: With the exceptionof Joanna. -Yeah.
421,00:17:25.73,00:17:25.73,I think she was showingher true colors a little bit.
422,00:17:27.77,00:17:27.77,ROB: I don't like Joanna.
423,00:17:29.33,00:17:29.33,She's always yelling about Jesusand how Jesus loves Jaburu.
424,00:17:33.77,00:17:33.77, I didn't know that Jesus had
425,00:17:35.03,00:17:35.03," a vested interest in Survivor 'cause,"
426,00:17:37.40,00:17:37.40,"as far as I've seen everypicture of him, Jesus is a guy."
427,00:17:39.50,00:17:39.50,I would think thathe would want the guys to win.
428,00:17:41.57,00:17:41.57,"And Jenna has always had thekind of dark, mysterious smile"
429,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,out of the corner of her eyeand a little twinkle.
430,00:17:45.77,00:17:45.77,Who is Jenna?
431,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,Jenna is the onewho was standing
432,00:17:47.83,00:17:47.83,"right next to me,with the black hair."
433,00:17:49.00,00:17:49.00,"-I know, I'm saying...-Oh, who is she?"
434,00:17:50.17,00:17:50.17,-philosophically.-Who is she?
435,00:17:51.23,00:17:51.23,We don't know.
436,00:17:52.23,00:17:52.23,"I think Jenna-- Jenna's, uh..."
437,00:17:54.50,00:17:54.50,"she turned and looked at me,we had eye contact for a second."
438,00:17:57.83,00:17:57.83,She is-- she has anengaging stare.
439,00:18:00.90,00:18:00.90,"Jenna is the hot chick at thebar who doesn't say anything,"
440,00:18:04.10,00:18:04.10,who's got the eyeand looks around
441,00:18:06.00,00:18:06.00,-and waits for the guy...-Waits for something to happen.
442,00:18:07.67,00:18:07.67,"...and the thing is,"
443,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67,"if you're not that guy,"
444,00:18:09.97,00:18:09.97,she'll shoot you downreal quick.
445,00:18:11.37,00:18:11.37,Jenna is a gorgeous individual.
446,00:18:13.73,00:18:13.73,She has-- her butt is so sexy.
447,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,"And Butch, the girls wereasking you more than once."
448,00:18:21.03,00:18:21.03,"Yeah, Shawna and Jenna."
449,00:18:22.17,00:18:22.17,"Shawna on the left,Jenna on the right."
450,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77,BUTCH: What I thought of Jenna was--
451,00:18:26.47,00:18:26.47,"I didn't consider like theother guys as a, as a hottie."
452,00:18:28.93,00:18:28.93,"I mean, I guess she is."
453,00:18:30.47,00:18:30.47,"Um, you know, I'm 50 years old."
454,00:18:31.67,00:18:31.67,"I'm not supposed to lookat things like that,"
455,00:18:33.23,00:18:33.23,but of courseI'm not dead either.
456,00:18:34.90,00:18:34.90,I really cannot wait to watch
457,00:18:37.00,00:18:37.00,when the girlsare all taking baths.
458,00:18:39.73,00:18:39.73,"""Heidi, do you need some helpwith your bosom?"""
459,00:18:42.43,00:18:42.43,"""Oh, sure, Jenna."""
460,00:18:44.10,00:18:44.10,(laughter)
461,00:18:53.27,00:18:53.27,DEENA: I can't get the mud from yesterday out of my shorts.
462,00:18:58.40,00:18:58.40,JEANNE:I just don't come clean.
463,00:19:01.07,00:19:01.07,DEENA:I'm losing my hair.
464,00:19:03.13,00:19:03.13,My hair.
465,00:19:05.60,00:19:05.60,CHRISTY: Bathing in general in front of other people--
466,00:19:09.10,00:19:09.10," it's a very, um,"
467,00:19:10.30,00:19:10.30,self-conscious thing.
468,00:19:11.97,00:19:11.97,Anyone need the scrub brush?
469,00:19:14.47,00:19:14.47,"CHRISTY: When we were bathing,I bathed with Jeanne and Deena."
470,00:19:18.93,00:19:18.93," And, of course,"
471,00:19:20.70,00:19:20.70,the girls my age...
472,00:19:21.97,00:19:21.97,"Heidi, we have to gobefore it gets dark."
473,00:19:24.23,00:19:24.23," ...are the ones that,"
474,00:19:25.27,00:19:25.27,"that, of course,I'm not invited."
475,00:19:27.40,00:19:27.40,(laughs)
476,00:19:28.40,00:19:28.40,And that's okay.
477,00:19:29.47,00:19:29.47,"I've learned to accept that,"
478,00:19:31.13,00:19:31.13, and they can go off and do their bathing thing
479,00:19:34.13,00:19:34.13, and wash and be pretty
480,00:19:35.70,00:19:35.70,and check each other out.
481,00:19:38.20,00:19:38.20,"Be like,""Oh, do I have any dirty spots?"""
482,00:19:46.03,00:19:46.03,"SHAWNA:Oh, this is so awesome."
483,00:19:48.73,00:19:48.73,HEIDI: The cuter girls-- me and Jenna and Shawna--
484,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80, kind of went off
485,00:19:52.53,00:19:52.53, from the older women because we're younger and we're cuter;
486,00:19:56.03,00:19:56.03," we've got better bodies; and, for some reason,"
487,00:19:58.60,00:19:58.60,that's like a huge issuewith older people.
488,00:20:00.80,00:20:00.80,"JENNA:Yes, we are masters of beauty."
489,00:20:02.47,00:20:02.47,(laughter)
490,00:20:03.90,00:20:03.90,"HEIDI: We're all very confident with our bodies,"
491,00:20:05.70,00:20:05.70," we're all three having fun,"
492,00:20:07.90,00:20:07.90,"we don't have these older women judging us, telling us"
493,00:20:09.93,00:20:09.93, what we should and shouldn't be doing.
494,00:20:12.13,00:20:12.13,-I'm taking my top off.-That's what I'm doing.
495,00:20:14.30,00:20:14.30,Oh.
496,00:20:18.20,00:20:18.20,(laughter)
497,00:20:20.27,00:20:20.27,"-It does feel good, doesn't it?-It feels like I was wearing"
498,00:20:22.30,00:20:22.30,"a sports bra for, like, years."
499,00:20:24.33,00:20:24.33,Ah... relief.
500,00:20:25.77,00:20:25.77,"SHAWNA: The three of us were washing each other,"
501,00:20:27.77,00:20:27.77, bathing topless in the Amazon River.
502,00:20:28.87,00:20:28.87, It felt like a soap commercial
503,00:20:30.07,00:20:30.07," that went wrong, and it felt so good"
504,00:20:33.53,00:20:33.53,to just be myself
505,00:20:34.97,00:20:34.97,and be partially nakedin an Amazon river.
506,00:20:38.87,00:20:38.87,"I mean, we're in Brazil."
507,00:20:41.40,00:20:41.40,It's nice to get underneathand all around.
508,00:20:43.53,00:20:43.53,"HEIDI: If there's a merge,"
509,00:20:45.10,00:20:45.10,it would definitely be to ouradvantage to go topless because
510,00:20:47.80,00:20:47.80,"guys, it's allthey ever think about."
511,00:20:49.90,00:20:49.90,"I think that they would just,like, have that on their brains"
512,00:20:51.87,00:20:51.87," all the time, instead of the game."
513,00:20:52.93,00:20:52.93," I think they'd be more like,"
514,00:20:54.30,00:20:54.30," ""I want to keep you on my team as long as possible"
515,00:20:57.17,00:20:57.17,"if I get to see thatall the time,"""
516,00:20:58.67,00:20:58.67,"so if their mind is distracted,"
517,00:21:00.93,00:21:00.93, then that just gives me achance to move one space ahead.
518,00:21:09.97,00:21:09.97,DAVE: It's hard for me to...to be with these personalities.
519,00:21:14.93,00:21:14.93," I mean, these guys are-- they're intense."
520,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,MATTHEW:Let me ask you something.
521,00:21:18.43,00:21:18.43,"Do you think that, uh..."
522,00:21:20.00,00:21:20.00,Which situation would be better:
523,00:21:21.87,00:21:21.87,without Daniel or without Roger?
524,00:21:25.87,00:21:25.87,I believe that taking out Danwould be better.
525,00:21:29.00,00:21:29.00,"After that,we'll see how it goes."
526,00:21:33.07,00:21:33.07,I think that you arethe best player on this tribe.
527,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83,"-Thank you, I appreciate it.-I think that I am"
528,00:21:38.90,00:21:38.90,"-a very underestimated player...-I think so, too."
529,00:21:42.03,00:21:42.03,...and I know thatI'm on the outside looking in.
530,00:21:44.37,00:21:44.37,"Yeah, but thatdoesn't have to be."
531,00:21:45.87,00:21:45.87,I would...
532,00:21:47.30,00:21:47.30,"There's a, there's,there's a certain someone"
533,00:21:48.87,00:21:48.87,"whose name's been brought up,"
534,00:21:50.33,00:21:50.33,"that if he went away, it wouldchange things very, very much."
535,00:21:53.93,00:21:53.93,-Roger?-Mm.
536,00:21:55.23,00:21:55.23,I want to do it.
537,00:21:56.80,00:21:56.80,"I mean, the person who makesthe most sense to eliminate"
538,00:22:00.43,00:22:00.43,"based on performance,obviously, is Daniel."
539,00:22:03.03,00:22:03.03,"But based on personalitiesand other issues,"
540,00:22:07.67,00:22:07.67,"both Rob and Al have pushed me,and mentioned Roger's name."
541,00:22:11.27,00:22:11.27,I said I wasn't gonna do it
542,00:22:12.37,00:22:12.37,unless it was gonna bea done deal.
543,00:22:13.43,00:22:13.43,I'm not gonna be onthe losing side at all.
544,00:22:14.93,00:22:14.93,Matt alread--Matt already came to me...
545,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,-And you want to do it?-...and brought it up.
546,00:22:17.73,00:22:17.73,I don't really trust anybody.
547,00:22:19.67,00:22:19.67,-Dude.-You know.
548,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,"I mean, you won't tellAlex this,"
549,00:22:22.27,00:22:22.27,"right, but, I mean,I don't trust him."
550,00:22:24.93,00:22:24.93,I don't trust Alex at all.
551,00:22:26.93,00:22:26.93,What about Dave?
552,00:22:28.67,00:22:28.67,I think we leave Daveout of it for right now.
553,00:22:30.17,00:22:30.17,That's-- I can't believethat this is happening.
554,00:22:32.60,00:22:32.60,This is the best day of my life.
555,00:22:34.23,00:22:34.23,This is like a dream come true.
556,00:22:36.30,00:22:36.30,(laughter)
557,00:22:37.60,00:22:37.60,There's a fish.
558,00:22:39.63,00:22:39.63,"Me being-- actually, I'll geta great-- another worm."
559,00:22:42.33,00:22:42.33,What a stitch.
560,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,"Dude, give me a potato."
561,00:22:45.77,00:22:45.77,-We'll hook that up.-What the...?
562,00:22:48.43,00:22:48.43,"Textbook, baby."
563,00:22:50.90,00:22:50.90,Leave him in the boat;let's get another one.
564,00:22:56.53,00:22:56.53,"Got some fish, guys."
565,00:22:57.93,00:22:57.93,-Monsters.-All right.
566,00:23:00.30,00:23:00.30,"Oh, yeah."
567,00:23:01.50,00:23:01.50,"We're going to needa bigger fire, man."
568,00:23:03.00,00:23:03.00,"Ready, dude?"
569,00:23:05.57,00:23:05.57,(laughter)
570,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,Cheapie soup.
571,00:23:09.63,00:23:09.63,What do you say-- six ounces?
572,00:23:11.60,00:23:11.60,BUTCH:Not even.
573,00:23:13.13,00:23:13.13,"DAVE: You know, for the past, past week or so,"
574,00:23:15.47,00:23:15.47, the focus has been really on surviving
575,00:23:18.23,00:23:18.23, and how we're going to make it out here.
576,00:23:19.60,00:23:19.60," And talking to Matt this morning,"
577,00:23:20.97,00:23:20.97,it really came.
578,00:23:22.10,00:23:22.10,"You know, we're hereto play a game"
579,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,and we're here to eliminate15 other people.
580,00:23:26.23,00:23:26.23,ALEX:You caught a fish?
581,00:23:27.23,00:23:27.23,-MATTHEW: Three.-Three.
582,00:23:28.73,00:23:28.73,"All right, look at that, baby."
583,00:23:32.70,00:23:32.70,Nice. Nice.
584,00:23:35.83,00:23:35.83,"Um, and what was interesting intalking to Matt this morning"
585,00:23:37.97,00:23:37.97,was to hear him talk about how
586,00:23:40.33,00:23:40.33," Alex has been talking to Rob about getting rid of Roger,"
587,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50," and, you know, it kind of opened up my eyes."
588,00:23:47.03,00:23:47.03,There's a lot more going onbehind the scenes
589,00:23:48.37,00:23:48.37,than I'm aware of.
590,00:23:49.70,00:23:49.70,"Guys, we got the momentum now,man... got the momentum."
591,00:23:52.87,00:23:52.87,ROB: David and Matthew
592,00:23:55.17,00:23:55.17,went out on a fishing tripand brought back three guppies.
593,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67," And Matthew is like, ""Oh, I'm going to make"
594,00:24:01.90,00:24:01.90," ""a fish bouillon soup,and it's so, it's so depressing"
595,00:24:06.40,00:24:06.40,"for a chef like myselfwithout these seasonings."""
596,00:24:09.73,00:24:09.73,"We're going to haveto wing it, guys."
597,00:24:10.97,00:24:10.97,"I mean, no utensils,no real service vessels."
598,00:24:15.23,00:24:15.23,It's going to be primitive.
599,00:24:17.37,00:24:17.37,We'll figure it out.
600,00:24:18.97,00:24:18.97,I think we can handle primitive.
601,00:24:20.73,00:24:20.73," I was like: Matt,"
602,00:24:21.73,00:24:21.73,"when I was in the fraternity,"
603,00:24:23.03,00:24:23.03,I would swallow fish that werebigger than this whole.
604,00:24:25.27,00:24:25.27,"-How we doing, fellas?-Did we get some flavor?"
605,00:24:27.23,00:24:27.23,MATTHEW:It's not a lot of flavor.
606,00:24:29.57,00:24:29.57,"You guys, I mean,I could put this broth"
607,00:24:31.73,00:24:31.73,back on the fire and concentrateit even more; it'd be better.
608,00:24:35.63,00:24:35.63,"Right now, it's pretty light."

856,00:35:11.37,00:35:11.37,I wasn't in on it.
857,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,ROB: Roger has told me
858,00:35:14.67,00:35:14.67, that he is at his wit's end with Daniel
859,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53, and that he may be very close
860,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,"to bursting,and I hope that happens."
861,00:35:20.93,00:35:20.93,I know that any timeany two people in the tribe
862,00:35:23.80,00:35:23.80,"are butting heads,that's good for business."
863,00:35:26.43,00:35:26.43,Who do you think Alexis going to vote for?
864,00:35:28.03,00:35:28.03,I think Alexis going to vote for Roger.
865,00:35:29.47,00:35:29.47,"-Yeah. Yeah. -A couple days ago,I thought it was going to be"
866,00:35:31.53,00:35:31.53,"-you and then me, but I thinkwe're going to be... -All right."
867,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,I think we're going to be herefor a little bit.
868,00:35:35.63,00:35:35.63,Roger's a pain in the ass.
869,00:35:36.90,00:35:36.90,"-Yeah, he is a pain in the ass.-Yeah."
870,00:35:38.57,00:35:38.57,"All right, I'm going to walkback to camp,"
871,00:35:40.27,00:35:40.27,but don't walk back...don't walk back with me.
872,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,DANIEL:Yeah. Yeah.
873,00:35:44.43,00:35:44.43,DANIEL: I'm just trying to realign right now
874,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47," with Rob, Alex and Matthew, and Rob really"
875,00:35:50.07,00:35:50.07," wants Roger to go, but Rob will only vote"
876,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,against Roger as long as the...the numbers are there.
877,00:35:56.20,00:35:56.20,"Rob, of course, approached me,and then Matt."
878,00:35:58.03,00:35:58.03,"He's going to try to save me,you know, if he..."
879,00:36:00.63,00:36:00.63,"whatever he can, but he can'treally do it much himself."
880,00:36:02.93,00:36:02.93,Right.
881,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00,So it's just allup in the air.
882,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,"Wherever you vote,Rob's going to vote."
883,00:36:08.13,00:36:08.13,"That's what he told me, so..."
884,00:36:10.40,00:36:10.40,"-Hmm. -You vote for me,he votes for me."
885,00:36:12.70,00:36:12.70,"-Hmm. -Vote for Roger,you... he votes for Roger."
886,00:36:15.10,00:36:15.10,Whatever.
887,00:36:17.47,00:36:17.47,"DAVE: Because it is relatively early in the game,"
888,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50, I don't really trust anybody.
889,00:36:20.93,00:36:20.93," We still are out here as a game,"
890,00:36:23.47,00:36:23.47, and to hear Matthew talk about how Alex
891,00:36:26.93,00:36:26.93,"seems to be tryingto be everybody's friends,"
892,00:36:29.13,00:36:29.13,"and-and get on different sides,"
893,00:36:31.73,00:36:31.73,"it made me wonder,what am I missing?"
894,00:36:34.93,00:36:34.93,"One for Dan, one for Roger."
895,00:36:36.87,00:36:36.87,"-One for Dan, one for Roger.-One Dan, one for Roger."
896,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,"Two for Dan, two for Roger."
897,00:36:43.53,00:36:43.53,Yeah.
898,00:36:44.70,00:36:44.70,And then three in a row for Dan.
899,00:36:46.97,00:36:46.97,Good night.
900,00:36:51.63,00:36:51.63,ROGER:And that will be that.
901,00:36:53.57,00:36:53.57,Mm-hmm.
902,00:37:26.03,00:37:26.03,How you guys feeling?
903,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,Rob?
904,00:37:28.63,00:37:28.63,I don't think any of usare feeling that great.
905,00:37:30.60,00:37:30.60,"We're at Tribal Councilfor the second time,"
906,00:37:32.80,00:37:32.80,which is two more times than anyof us had wanted to be here.
907,00:37:35.63,00:37:35.63,"So I think we're feelingpretty lousy right now, Jeff."
908,00:37:38.20,00:37:38.20,"-How about you, Dave?-Eight guys"
909,00:37:40.00,00:37:40.00,"certainly don't like to loseagainst eight girls,"
910,00:37:42.20,00:37:42.20,"and, uh, we had a slow start,"
911,00:37:44.30,00:37:44.30,"but, uh, I really...I'm-I'm fully confident"
912,00:37:46.57,00:37:46.57,"that we can come backand, uh,"
913,00:37:48.07,00:37:48.07,pull some big winsin the near future.
914,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"PROBST:Roger, do you feel a little"
915,00:37:51.63,00:37:51.63,like Bobby Riggsand Billie Jean King?
916,00:37:54.00,00:37:54.00,You're letting downan entire gender here.
917,00:37:56.70,00:37:56.70,"We did everythingas best we could, and..."
918,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,"hey, they beat us, so..."
919,00:38:01.43,00:38:01.43,"PROBST:Matthew, how about you?"
920,00:38:02.53,00:38:02.53,"How hungry,scale of one to ten?"
921,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,I'm about an eight.
922,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33,-That's pretty hungry.-Manioc is getting very old.
923,00:38:08.37,00:38:08.37,I have a hard timekeeping it down.
924,00:38:10.60,00:38:10.60,"How about you, Alex?"
925,00:38:11.97,00:38:11.97,About the same as Matthew.
926,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,"I'm up there at eight,maybe even a nine."
927,00:38:15.80,00:38:15.80,"Mm-- I'm hungry,and I'm feeling it."
928,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,"Daniel, how about the fishing?"
929,00:38:20.20,00:38:20.20,How many hours a dayare you guys working on that?
930,00:38:21.93,00:38:21.93,"We're actually going out therea couple hours a day, at least."
931,00:38:24.47,00:38:24.47,How many hours of daylightyou figure you get out here?
932,00:38:26.80,00:38:26.80,About ten.
933,00:38:28.03,00:38:28.03,"PROBST:Roger, did you fish today?"
934,00:38:29.73,00:38:29.73,"Uh, no. I'm not a fisherman."
935,00:38:31.13,00:38:31.13,-PROBST: Matthew?-I did fish today.
936,00:38:33.00,00:38:33.00,-How long?-Fished for about an hour.
937,00:38:35.53,00:38:35.53,"Would you say it's fairto say, ""Hey, Jeff,"
938,00:38:38.20,00:38:38.20,"""if you were watching us,you'd see we are putting forth"
939,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,"everything we canto try and figure this out?"""
940,00:38:42.47,00:38:42.47,I think we could spendmore time out there.
941,00:38:45.20,00:38:45.20,Let's talk about friendships.
942,00:38:46.93,00:38:46.93,"Daniel, feeling any bondwith any of these guys?"
943,00:38:50.10,00:38:50.10,"Well, the person I getalong with the best is Matthew."
944,00:38:52.87,00:38:52.87,"He was born in...in Hong Kong, so..."
945,00:38:55.07,00:38:55.07,he's probably more Chinesethan I am.
946,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,"And, uh, he knowshow to speak Chinese,"
947,00:38:58.30,00:38:58.30,so that's a definite plus.
948,00:38:59.97,00:38:59.97,"Um, I'm differentthan anybody else."
949,00:39:02.30,00:39:02.30,I'm one Asian guyversus seven other white guys.
950,00:39:05.43,00:39:05.43,"Even though I was bornand raised in the U.S.,"
951,00:39:07.53,00:39:07.53,"you know, just,even before I speak,"
952,00:39:09.63,00:39:09.63,"I stand out from the rest,"
953,00:39:10.90,00:39:10.90,and sometimesthat makes me an outcast.
954,00:39:12.63,00:39:12.63,ROB:That is completely false.
955,00:39:15.00,00:39:15.00,I don't think for one secondany of us said
956,00:39:18.13,00:39:18.13,"that we're going to treat Danielany differently because his,"
957,00:39:20.90,00:39:20.90,"uh, relativesare from a different country"
958,00:39:22.43,00:39:22.43,than our relatives may be from.
959,00:39:23.80,00:39:23.80,We're all fromdifferent places and from
960,00:39:26.23,00:39:26.23,"different backgrounds,and we all realize"
961,00:39:28.63,00:39:28.63,that everybody's differentand that's what makes us unique.
962,00:39:31.87,00:39:31.87,"PROBST: Roger, you were shakingyour head a little bit."
963,00:39:33.40,00:39:33.40,"What's your assessment? I mean,obviously, there's friction"
964,00:39:36.10,00:39:36.10,-between you two guys.-ROGER: My frustration with Dan
965,00:39:38.87,00:39:38.87,"started, uh, when I asked him"
966,00:39:40.60,00:39:40.60,"to go down to the lakeand get the water,"
967,00:39:42.43,00:39:42.43,"and he kind of hesitatedand, you know,"
968,00:39:44.67,00:39:44.67,"""You need to help me,""kind of a deal."
969,00:39:46.77,00:39:46.77,"So I said, ""Screw it, buddy.I'll go down and get it myself."""
970,00:39:50.20,00:39:50.20,"Well, in defense to...to what Roger said, uh,"
971,00:39:52.63,00:39:52.63,he's been barking orders likea drill sergeant since day one.
972,00:39:55.37,00:39:55.37,"Um... I mean, he doesn't...he doesn't ask nicely, you know?"
973,00:39:59.10,00:39:59.10,"So I said, ""Fine. You wantto do it, go right ahead."""
974,00:40:06.03,00:40:06.03,So friendship's out the window.
975,00:40:09.37,00:40:09.37,It is time to vote.
976,00:40:10.53,00:40:10.53,"Daniel, you're first."
977,00:40:22.27,00:40:22.27,"Roger, you've been out heresix days too long."
978,00:40:24.73,00:40:24.73,Talk to you later.
979,00:40:35.70,00:40:35.70,"Dan, I think I pretty muchsaid it at Tribal Council."
980,00:40:39.20,00:40:39.20,"You're out of your element,"
981,00:40:40.87,00:40:40.87, and you have not been a team player.
982,00:41:09.03,00:41:09.03,I'll go tally the votes.
983,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
984,00:41:25.17,00:41:25.17,Person voted outwill be asked to leave
985,00:41:26.87,00:41:26.87,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
986,00:41:28.57,00:41:28.57,I'll read the votes.
987,00:41:33.67,00:41:33.67,First vote.
988,00:41:36.37,00:41:36.37,Dan.
989,00:41:41.87,00:41:41.87,"Roger. That's one vote Roger,one vote Dan."
990,00:41:48.77,00:41:48.77,Dan.That's two votes.
991,00:41:52.43,00:41:52.43,Three votes Dan.
992,00:42:02.37,00:42:02.37,Dan. That's four votes.
993,00:42:04.33,00:42:04.33,That's enough.Need to bring me your torch.
994,00:42:15.93,00:42:15.93,"Daniel, the tribe has spoken."
995,00:42:18.40,00:42:18.40,It's time for you to go.
996,00:42:32.73,00:42:32.73,You guys have lost fourout of five challenges.
997,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,I think you guys knowwhat you need to do--
998,00:42:36.73,00:42:36.73,you just need to go do it.
999,00:42:38.37,00:42:38.37,You can head back to camp.Good night.
