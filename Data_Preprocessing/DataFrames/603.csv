2,00:00:01.43,00:00:01.43,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor:
3,00:00:02.90,00:00:02.90," When an Amazon rainstorm  blew in,"
4,00:00:04.47,00:00:04.47, Tambaqui took cover...
5,00:00:06.07,00:00:06.07,It sucks to be outside right now.
6,00:00:07.60,00:00:07.60,PROBST: ...while  Jaburu's pitiful shelter
7,00:00:09.47,00:00:09.47,left the women out in the cold.
8,00:00:10.83,00:00:10.83,I can't believe how badly this sucks.
9,00:00:14.93,00:00:14.93,"PROBST: At the reward  challenge, the women"
10,00:00:16.47,00:00:16.47,won some much-needed fish bait.
11,00:00:18.47,00:00:18.47,Jaburu wins their second challenge in a row.
12,00:00:21.60,00:00:21.60," Back at Tambaqui,  the men licked their wounds."
13,00:00:23.87,00:00:23.87,DAVE:  Everybody wants to win.
14,00:00:25.33,00:00:25.33, Particularly seven guys
15,00:00:26.67,00:00:26.67,don't want to lose to a bunch of girls.
16,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,"PROBST:  And at Jaburu,"
17,00:00:29.83,00:00:29.83, the discovery of a granola bar
18,00:00:31.20,00:00:31.20, put Janet in hot water.
19,00:00:32.53,00:00:32.53,JOANNA: Jeanne saw  the little candy bar thing
20,00:00:35.53,00:00:35.53,inside of Janet's bag.
21,00:00:36.83,00:00:36.83,"JANET: If you're gonna vote me off, that's fine,"
22,00:00:38.20,00:00:38.20,"as long as it's not for that reason,"
23,00:00:39.53,00:00:39.53,"because if it is, you're making a mistake."
24,00:00:40.97,00:00:40.97,"PROBST: Jaburu, no score."
25,00:00:42.03,00:00:42.03,The contest is over.
26,00:00:44.10,00:00:44.10,Tambaqui-- immunity.
27,00:00:45.60,00:00:45.60,"-(cheering)  -At the immunity challenge,"
28,00:00:47.13,00:00:47.13,"the men finally tasted victory,"
29,00:00:49.47,00:00:49.47," sending the Jaburu women  to their first Tribal Council,"
30,00:00:52.47,00:00:52.47, where Janet was the second person voted out of the Amazon.
31,00:00:57.13,00:00:57.13, 14 are left.
32,00:00:58.40,00:00:58.40, Who will be voted out tonight?
33,00:02:08.57,00:02:08.57,"(thunder cracks, rumbles)"
34,00:02:09.57,00:02:09.57,"And on the seventh day, the Lord said to rest,"
35,00:02:12.40,00:02:12.40,but that's not us.
36,00:02:21.77,00:02:21.77,"Come on, baby."
37,00:02:24.63,00:02:24.63,That hurt.
38,00:02:26.67,00:02:26.67,"ROB: We had a bad rainstorm  yesterday, and we had"
39,00:02:30.47,00:02:30.47," a lot of leaks,  and everybody was getting wet,"
40,00:02:33.83,00:02:33.83, and we decided to fix up  our roof today.
41,00:02:37.07,00:02:37.07,I can't imagine that the girls have a shelter
42,00:02:39.93,00:02:39.93,that is comparable to ours.
43,00:02:41.77,00:02:41.77,"Uh, maybe it's more comfortable  than ours,"
44,00:02:43.50,00:02:43.50," but we're men,  and we just build,"
45,00:02:45.83,00:02:45.83, and we think  about comfort later.
46,00:02:47.73,00:02:47.73," Where we want to build  an awesome structure,"
47,00:02:50.10,00:02:50.10,"something big to look at, that's what we do."
48,00:02:52.27,00:02:52.27,We're the men.
49,00:02:57.57,00:02:57.57,"Oh, Danny, can you get us some water?"
50,00:03:00.40,00:03:00.40,Sure.
51,00:03:03.00,00:03:03.00,Can you handle it by yourself or not?
52,00:03:05.07,00:03:05.07,Yeah.
53,00:03:06.53,00:03:06.53,"Okay, when you carry it back, put it on your shoulder."
54,00:03:08.80,00:03:08.80,Are you going to go with me or what?
55,00:03:10.67,00:03:10.67,"Well, I was going to go do it myself..."
56,00:03:12.37,00:03:12.37,"I don't, I don't..."
57,00:03:15.07,00:03:15.07,I think if you...
58,00:03:16.60,00:03:16.60,I'll go do it.
59,00:03:24.13,00:03:24.13,(thunder cracks)
60,00:03:41.90,00:03:41.90,"ROGER:  Picked up the deal,"
61,00:03:43.50,00:03:43.50," went down myself,  and I told him..."
62,00:03:44.77,00:03:44.77, Look at him.
63,00:03:45.90,00:03:45.90, Come on.  He's a little Hercules.
64,00:03:47.47,00:03:47.47,"If I can go down and pick up a five-gallon deal,"
65,00:03:49.60,00:03:49.60,"put it on my shoulders, and carry it back up..."
66,00:03:51.50,00:03:51.50, And I real...  It really got me hot.
67,00:03:53.47,00:03:53.47," I, um... I had to..."
68,00:03:56.17,00:03:56.17,"I'm tempted to slap the kid around, to be honest with you."
69,00:04:03.47,00:04:03.47,DANIEL: The-the thing  that irritates me about Roger
70,00:04:06.17,00:04:06.17, is that he just barks orders  all the time.
71,00:04:08.20,00:04:08.20,"I mean, he's not very friendly about it."
72,00:04:09.43,00:04:09.43,He just tells people what to do.
73,00:04:11.27,00:04:11.27," Uh, I'm not really speaking  to Roger right now."
74,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67," Um, he knows that he wants"
75,00:04:15.03,00:04:15.03," to vote for me, and I know  I want to vote for him."
76,00:04:17.83,00:04:17.83," And also, he smells bad."
77,00:04:19.30,00:04:19.30,He smells like really spoiled vinegar?
78,00:04:22.30,00:04:22.30,Almost... Almost had it out with him.
79,00:04:25.27,00:04:25.27,DAVE: Which one?
80,00:04:26.27,00:04:26.27,Dan. Lazy...
81,00:04:28.40,00:04:28.40, It really pissed me off.
82,00:04:31.27,00:04:31.27, Almost to the point
83,00:04:32.47,00:04:32.47,that I was ready to give him a kung fu chop.
84,00:04:35.20,00:04:35.20,"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
85,00:04:36.90,00:04:36.90,But I'm relaxing. 
86,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80,I'm relaxing.
87,00:04:41.03,00:04:41.03,MATTHEW:  It'll be cool.
88,00:04:42.03,00:04:42.03, I think what you should do--
89,00:04:43.77,00:04:43.77,don't let this situation get you down.
90,00:04:46.57,00:04:46.57,"Don't get bummed out about it, even though it's... it's..."
91,00:04:49.07,00:04:49.07,"There's a lot of, uh, bull going on,"
92,00:04:51.73,00:04:51.73,"you know, people still"
93,00:04:53.07,00:04:53.07,jockeying for position and currying favor.
94,00:04:56.87,00:04:56.87,"Right now, there's still momentum to boot Roger."
95,00:04:59.67,00:04:59.67,He's still the prime candidate.
96,00:05:01.07,00:05:01.07,(Matthew speaking Mandarin)
97,00:05:11.67,00:05:11.67, MATTHEW: Daniel and I  came together because
98,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10, he speaks Mandarin  and Cantonese;
99,00:05:15.50,00:05:15.50, I was born in Hong Kong;
100,00:05:17.77,00:05:17.77," I speak some Mandarin,"
101,00:05:19.37,00:05:19.37,"and we started to speak Mandarin together,"
102,00:05:21.53,00:05:21.53,and there was an immediate connection.
103,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,Physically or what?
104,00:05:41.60,00:05:41.60,-Oh. -Secure.
105,00:05:45.73,00:05:45.73,DANIEL: Matthew and I  are great friends.
106,00:05:47.10,00:05:47.10," He's my best friend out here,"
107,00:05:48.10,00:05:48.10, and he's a really good ally.
108,00:05:49.93,00:05:49.93,"When he tells you something, he's being truthful,"
109,00:05:52.00,00:05:52.00,whereas the other guys around here--
110,00:05:53.37,00:05:53.37,"when they tell you something, you have no idea"
111,00:05:55.23,00:05:55.23,if they're telling the truth or if they're lying.
112,00:06:02.77,00:06:02.77,Mm-hmm.
113,00:06:04.27,00:06:04.27,"All right, dude, let's go back"
114,00:06:06.83,00:06:06.83,"to the, uh, the rat pack."
115,00:06:12.20,00:06:12.20,(squawking)
116,00:06:16.87,00:06:16.87,(insects buzzing)
117,00:06:26.30,00:06:26.30,"JEANNE:  This is day seven,"
118,00:06:27.77,00:06:27.77, and our tribe is  pretty much pathetic.
119,00:06:31.43,00:06:31.43,Definitely the hygiene of the camp right now--
120,00:06:33.20,00:06:33.20,"that's, uh, lacking."
121,00:06:34.83,00:06:34.83,(buzzing)
122,00:06:36.17,00:06:36.17,"I thought they cleaned the pot,  but they didn't"
123,00:06:37.77,00:06:37.77," clean it out thoroughly,  and there's wasps"
124,00:06:39.53,00:06:39.53,all over the camp this morning.
125,00:06:41.30,00:06:41.30,"Yeah, I'm actually allergic to bees,"
126,00:06:43.27,00:06:43.27,so that's why I want to try to trap them in there.
127,00:06:46.00,00:06:46.00,(buzzing)
128,00:06:49.87,00:06:49.87,(soft groaning)
129,00:06:51.87,00:06:51.87,That's what attracted all those noises last night.
130,00:06:54.97,00:06:54.97,-Tarantula. -Can I see?
131,00:06:56.63,00:06:56.63,DEENA: Holy crappy-oli.
132,00:06:58.53,00:06:58.53,-(chopping in distance) -Give me the knife.
133,00:07:00.67,00:07:00.67,JENNA: What's with our food?
134,00:07:01.80,00:07:01.80,They always want our food.
135,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,-Jeanne! -(laughter)
136,00:07:09.17,00:07:09.17,Sorry.
137,00:07:10.17,00:07:10.17,Spider's dead.
138,00:07:12.57,00:07:12.57,"Oh, that's lovely."
139,00:07:14.60,00:07:14.60,"That would be the nice, fresh smell of mold."
140,00:07:16.93,00:07:16.93,"That needs to come out, that moldy stuff."
141,00:07:24.90,00:07:24.90,What are we doing?
142,00:07:26.73,00:07:26.73,The four of us here-- do we have a plan?
143,00:07:30.87,00:07:30.87,"We need wood, and we need fire going."
144,00:07:36.93,00:07:36.93,JEANNE: We've been spinning our wheels.
145,00:07:38.93,00:07:38.93, You can't spin your wheels  in the jungle.
146,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,Everyone has their own agenda.
147,00:07:43.20,00:07:43.20,My priority is water.
148,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,See? We have none.
149,00:07:47.00,00:07:47.00,My agenda is food.
150,00:07:49.27,00:07:49.27,And then whatever else we have to do-- I have no idea.
151,00:07:51.70,00:07:51.70,"I'm so hungry, I can't even think straight."
152,00:07:53.77,00:07:53.77,We've got girls who are freezing at night.
153,00:07:55.13,00:07:55.13,"They don't have any shoes on their feet,"
154,00:07:57.30,00:07:57.30,"and there's no fire near the shelter,"
155,00:07:59.27,00:07:59.27,and the shelter over there is not big enough.
156,00:08:01.33,00:08:01.33,"JEANNE:  We got one, two, three, four,"
157,00:08:04.43,00:08:04.43,five different kind of things going on here.
158,00:08:06.67,00:08:06.67," We promised each other  as a tribe, last night,"
159,00:08:08.93,00:08:08.93,that we were going to have a meeting to get our...
160,00:08:11.47,00:08:11.47,things in order.
161,00:08:12.73,00:08:12.73,We all have to call this meeting in order now.
162,00:08:20.67,00:08:20.67,"Shawna, can you make it to a meeting?"
163,00:08:23.40,00:08:23.40,Shawna?
164,00:08:24.50,00:08:24.50,She's sleeping.
165,00:08:25.77,00:08:25.77,"-She's out. -Well, she's part of the tribe."
166,00:08:27.47,00:08:27.47,I'm gonna wake her up.
167,00:08:28.80,00:08:28.80,Hey...
168,00:08:30.43,00:08:30.43,we need to have a meeting.
169,00:08:31.50,00:08:31.50,Can you take a...
170,00:08:32.63,00:08:32.63,-SHAWNA: Yeah. -Okay. We're going to go over there.
171,00:08:36.63,00:08:36.63,The meeting is called to order.
172,00:08:40.10,00:08:40.10,"So I think we should, uh, maybe"
173,00:08:43.27,00:08:43.27,initiate a leader.
174,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,"I, um, initiate Deena."
175,00:08:48.83,00:08:48.83,-Anybody...? -Second that? Okay.
176,00:08:50.73,00:08:50.73,"JEANNE: Strategically,  Joanna and I decided to put"
177,00:08:54.00,00:08:54.00,Deena up for the leadership position because
178,00:08:57.13,00:08:57.13," we think she's  a little hotheaded,"
179,00:08:58.80,00:08:58.80, and I think she's going  to create a little friction.
180,00:09:01.33,00:09:01.33,"Deena, do you accept the offer?"
181,00:09:04.80,00:09:04.80,"You know, I'm going to..."
182,00:09:06.97,00:09:06.97,All I want to do is-- we delegate the tasks
183,00:09:09.17,00:09:09.17,-that are important for the day. -SHAWNA: We don't need a leader.
184,00:09:11.27,00:09:11.27,We need a delegator. We need someone who's gonna step in
185,00:09:13.33,00:09:13.33,"-and give us some structure. -""Okay, hey, you do that,"
186,00:09:14.87,00:09:14.87,"-you do that""? -DEENA: Nobody wants to step up"
187,00:09:16.67,00:09:16.67,"to be leader, because that puts"
188,00:09:17.90,00:09:17.90,"a big target on your body,"
189,00:09:19.53,00:09:19.53,and who wants to get voted out of the game?
190,00:09:22.07,00:09:22.07," I didn't take that  with open arms,"
191,00:09:23.43,00:09:23.43," but, yes, I am going to do it."
192,00:09:24.97,00:09:24.97, I am going to delegate tasks.
193,00:09:26.07,00:09:26.07, I told them  that that was my goal.
194,00:09:27.83,00:09:27.83,"Okay, we're a little bit raggedy."
195,00:09:29.83,00:09:29.83,"-We're okay. -HEIDI: You know what's impressive,"
196,00:09:31.73,00:09:31.73,"is that we live like this,"
197,00:09:33.57,00:09:33.57,and we've won two out of three things.
198,00:09:35.07,00:09:35.07,"-(laughter) -I mean, really."
199,00:09:36.33,00:09:36.33, This group is  such a good group.
200,00:09:37.83,00:09:37.83," When it, when it comes time  to pull your butt together"
201,00:09:40.97,00:09:40.97,"and say, hey, what..."
202,00:09:42.40,00:09:42.40,"here's the organization we need for... to win this thing,"
203,00:09:45.20,00:09:45.20, we are such a good group  together.
204,00:09:46.47,00:09:46.47,(indistinct talking)

410,00:17:01.27,00:17:01.27, She's probably a 9 1/2
411,00:17:02.70,00:17:02.70,"in real life and right about now she's closing in on a six,"
412,00:17:06.67,00:17:06.67,"so that kind of levels the playing field for a guy like me,"
413,00:17:09.73,00:17:09.73,which is an exciting prospect.
414,00:17:12.10,00:17:12.10,I had a great time. I finally got to meet Shawna
415,00:17:13.77,00:17:13.77,and I think she digs me.
416,00:17:14.87,00:17:14.87,I can tell by the little twinkle in her eye
417,00:17:16.60,00:17:16.60,"when I met her, you know."
418,00:17:17.83,00:17:17.83,"ROGER: And the fun I had-- honestly, honestly, Alex--"
419,00:17:19.80,00:17:19.80,was to see you guys react with these women.
420,00:17:21.87,00:17:21.87,"DANIEL: Overall, they seemed pretty nice."
421,00:17:23.00,00:17:23.00,-ROB: With the exception of Joanna. -Yeah.
422,00:17:25.73,00:17:25.73,I think she was showing her true colors a little bit.
423,00:17:27.77,00:17:27.77,ROB:  I don't like Joanna.
424,00:17:29.33,00:17:29.33,She's always yelling about Jesus and how Jesus loves Jaburu.
425,00:17:33.77,00:17:33.77, I didn't know that Jesus had
426,00:17:35.03,00:17:35.03," a vested interest  in Survivor 'cause,"
427,00:17:37.40,00:17:37.40,"as far as I've seen every picture of him, Jesus is a guy."
428,00:17:39.50,00:17:39.50,I would think that he would want the guys to win.
429,00:17:41.57,00:17:41.57,"And Jenna has always had the kind of dark, mysterious smile"
430,00:17:43.83,00:17:43.83,out of the corner of her eye and a little twinkle.
431,00:17:45.77,00:17:45.77,Who is Jenna?
432,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,Jenna is the one who was standing
433,00:17:47.83,00:17:47.83,"right next to me, with the black hair."
434,00:17:49.00,00:17:49.00,"-I know, I'm saying... -Oh, who is she?"
435,00:17:50.17,00:17:50.17,-philosophically. -Who is she?
436,00:17:51.23,00:17:51.23,We don't know.
437,00:17:52.23,00:17:52.23,"I think Jenna-- Jenna's, uh..."
438,00:17:54.50,00:17:54.50,"she turned and looked at me, we had eye contact for a second."
439,00:17:57.83,00:17:57.83,She is-- she has an engaging stare.
440,00:18:00.90,00:18:00.90,"Jenna is the hot chick at the bar who doesn't say anything,"
441,00:18:04.10,00:18:04.10,who's got the eye and looks around
442,00:18:06.00,00:18:06.00,-and waits for the guy... -Waits for something to happen.
443,00:18:07.67,00:18:07.67,"...and the thing is,"
444,00:18:08.67,00:18:08.67,"if you're not that guy,"
445,00:18:09.97,00:18:09.97,she'll shoot you down real quick.
446,00:18:11.37,00:18:11.37,Jenna is a gorgeous individual.
447,00:18:13.73,00:18:13.73,She has-- her butt is so sexy.
448,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,"And Butch, the girls were asking you more than once."
449,00:18:21.03,00:18:21.03,"Yeah, Shawna and Jenna."
450,00:18:22.17,00:18:22.17,"Shawna on the left, Jenna on the right."
451,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77,BUTCH:  What I thought of Jenna was--
452,00:18:26.47,00:18:26.47,"I didn't consider like the other guys as a, as a hottie."
453,00:18:28.93,00:18:28.93,"I mean, I guess she is."
454,00:18:30.47,00:18:30.47,"Um, you know, I'm 50 years old."
455,00:18:31.67,00:18:31.67,"I'm not supposed to look at things like that,"
456,00:18:33.23,00:18:33.23,but of course I'm not dead either.
457,00:18:34.90,00:18:34.90,I really cannot wait to watch
458,00:18:37.00,00:18:37.00,when the girls are all taking baths.
459,00:18:39.73,00:18:39.73,"""Heidi, do you need some help with your bosom?"""
460,00:18:42.43,00:18:42.43,"""Oh, sure, Jenna."""
461,00:18:44.10,00:18:44.10,(laughter)
462,00:18:53.27,00:18:53.27,DEENA: I can't get the mud from  yesterday out of my shorts.
463,00:18:58.40,00:18:58.40,JEANNE: I just don't come clean.
464,00:19:01.07,00:19:01.07,DEENA: I'm losing my hair.
465,00:19:03.13,00:19:03.13,My hair.
466,00:19:05.60,00:19:05.60,CHRISTY: Bathing in general  in front of other people--
467,00:19:09.10,00:19:09.10," it's a very, um,"
468,00:19:10.30,00:19:10.30,self-conscious thing.
469,00:19:11.97,00:19:11.97,Anyone need the scrub brush?
470,00:19:14.47,00:19:14.47,"CHRISTY: When we were bathing, I bathed with Jeanne and Deena."
471,00:19:18.93,00:19:18.93," And, of course,"
472,00:19:20.70,00:19:20.70,the girls my age...
473,00:19:21.97,00:19:21.97,"Heidi, we have to go before it gets dark."
474,00:19:24.23,00:19:24.23," ...are the ones that,"
475,00:19:25.27,00:19:25.27,"that, of course, I'm not invited."
476,00:19:27.40,00:19:27.40,(laughs)
477,00:19:28.40,00:19:28.40,And that's okay.
478,00:19:29.47,00:19:29.47,"I've learned to accept that,"
479,00:19:31.13,00:19:31.13, and they can go off  and do their bathing thing
480,00:19:34.13,00:19:34.13, and wash and be pretty
481,00:19:35.70,00:19:35.70,and check each other out.
482,00:19:38.20,00:19:38.20,"Be like, ""Oh, do I have any dirty spots?"""
483,00:19:46.03,00:19:46.03,"SHAWNA: Oh, this is so awesome."
484,00:19:48.73,00:19:48.73,HEIDI: The cuter girls--  me and Jenna and Shawna--
485,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80, kind of went off
486,00:19:52.53,00:19:52.53, from the older women because  we're younger and we're cuter;
487,00:19:56.03,00:19:56.03," we've got better bodies;  and, for some reason,"
488,00:19:58.60,00:19:58.60,that's like a huge issue with older people.
489,00:20:00.80,00:20:00.80,"JENNA: Yes, we are masters of beauty."
490,00:20:02.47,00:20:02.47,(laughter)
491,00:20:03.90,00:20:03.90,"HEIDI: We're all very confident  with our bodies,"
492,00:20:05.70,00:20:05.70," we're all three having fun,"
493,00:20:07.90,00:20:07.90,"we don't have these older women  judging us, telling us"
494,00:20:09.93,00:20:09.93, what we should  and shouldn't be doing.
495,00:20:12.13,00:20:12.13,-I'm taking my top off. -That's what I'm doing.
496,00:20:14.30,00:20:14.30,Oh.
497,00:20:18.20,00:20:18.20,(laughter)
498,00:20:20.27,00:20:20.27,"-It does feel good, doesn't it? -It feels like I was wearing"
499,00:20:22.30,00:20:22.30,"a sports bra for, like, years."
500,00:20:24.33,00:20:24.33,Ah... relief.
501,00:20:25.77,00:20:25.77,"SHAWNA: The three of us  were washing each other,"
502,00:20:27.77,00:20:27.77, bathing topless  in the Amazon River.
503,00:20:28.87,00:20:28.87, It felt like a soap commercial
504,00:20:30.07,00:20:30.07," that went wrong,  and it felt so good"
505,00:20:33.53,00:20:33.53,to just be myself
506,00:20:34.97,00:20:34.97,and be partially naked in an Amazon river.
507,00:20:38.87,00:20:38.87,"I mean, we're in Brazil."
508,00:20:41.40,00:20:41.40,It's nice to get underneath and all around.
509,00:20:43.53,00:20:43.53,"HEIDI:  If there's a merge,"
510,00:20:45.10,00:20:45.10,it would definitely be to our advantage to go topless because
511,00:20:47.80,00:20:47.80,"guys, it's all they ever think about."
512,00:20:49.90,00:20:49.90,"I think that they would just, like, have that on their brains"
513,00:20:51.87,00:20:51.87," all the time,  instead of the game."
514,00:20:52.93,00:20:52.93," I think they'd be more like,"
515,00:20:54.30,00:20:54.30," ""I want to keep you on my team  as long as possible"
516,00:20:57.17,00:20:57.17,"if I get to see that all the time,"""
517,00:20:58.67,00:20:58.67,"so if their mind is distracted,"
518,00:21:00.93,00:21:00.93, then that just gives me a chance to move one space ahead.
519,00:21:09.97,00:21:09.97,DAVE: It's hard for me to... to be with these personalities.
520,00:21:14.93,00:21:14.93," I mean, these guys are--  they're intense."
521,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,MATTHEW: Let me ask you something.
522,00:21:18.43,00:21:18.43,"Do you think that, uh..."
523,00:21:20.00,00:21:20.00,Which situation would be better:
524,00:21:21.87,00:21:21.87,without Daniel or without Roger?
525,00:21:25.87,00:21:25.87,I believe that taking out Dan would be better.
526,00:21:29.00,00:21:29.00,"After that, we'll see how it goes."
527,00:21:33.07,00:21:33.07,I think that you are the best player on this tribe.
528,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83,"-Thank you, I appreciate it. -I think that I am"
529,00:21:38.90,00:21:38.90,"-a very underestimated player... -I think so, too."
530,00:21:42.03,00:21:42.03,...and I know that I'm on the outside looking in.
531,00:21:44.37,00:21:44.37,"Yeah, but that doesn't have to be."
532,00:21:45.87,00:21:45.87,I would...
533,00:21:47.30,00:21:47.30,"There's a, there's, there's a certain someone"
534,00:21:48.87,00:21:48.87,"whose name's been brought up,"
535,00:21:50.33,00:21:50.33,"that if he went away, it would change things very, very much."
536,00:21:53.93,00:21:53.93,-Roger? -Mm.
537,00:21:55.23,00:21:55.23,I want to do it.
538,00:21:56.80,00:21:56.80,"I mean, the person who makes the most sense to eliminate"
539,00:22:00.43,00:22:00.43,"based on performance, obviously, is Daniel."
540,00:22:03.03,00:22:03.03,"But based on personalities and other issues,"
541,00:22:07.67,00:22:07.67,"both Rob and Al have pushed me, and mentioned Roger's name."
542,00:22:11.27,00:22:11.27,I said I wasn't gonna do it
543,00:22:12.37,00:22:12.37,unless it was gonna be a done deal.
544,00:22:13.43,00:22:13.43,I'm not gonna be on the losing side at all.
545,00:22:14.93,00:22:14.93,Matt alread-- Matt already came to me...
546,00:22:16.10,00:22:16.10,-And you want to do it? -...and brought it up.
547,00:22:17.73,00:22:17.73,I don't really trust anybody.
548,00:22:19.67,00:22:19.67,-Dude. -You know.
549,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,"I mean, you won't tell Alex this,"
550,00:22:22.27,00:22:22.27,"right, but, I mean, I don't trust him."
551,00:22:24.93,00:22:24.93,I don't trust Alex at all.
552,00:22:26.93,00:22:26.93,What about Dave?
553,00:22:28.67,00:22:28.67,I think we leave Dave out of it for right now.
554,00:22:30.17,00:22:30.17,That's-- I can't believe that this is happening.
555,00:22:32.60,00:22:32.60,This is the best day of my life.
556,00:22:34.23,00:22:34.23,This is like a dream come true.
557,00:22:36.30,00:22:36.30,(laughter)
558,00:22:37.60,00:22:37.60,There's a fish.
559,00:22:39.63,00:22:39.63,"Me being-- actually, I'll get a great-- another worm."
560,00:22:42.33,00:22:42.33,What a stitch.
561,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,"Dude, give me a potato."
562,00:22:45.77,00:22:45.77,-We'll hook that up. -What the...?
563,00:22:48.43,00:22:48.43,"Textbook, baby."
564,00:22:50.90,00:22:50.90,Leave him in the boat; let's get another one.
565,00:22:56.53,00:22:56.53,"Got some fish, guys."
566,00:22:57.93,00:22:57.93,-Monsters. -All right.
567,00:23:00.30,00:23:00.30,"Oh, yeah."
568,00:23:01.50,00:23:01.50,"We're going to need a bigger fire, man."
569,00:23:03.00,00:23:03.00,"Ready, dude?"
570,00:23:05.57,00:23:05.57,(laughter)
571,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,Cheapie soup.
572,00:23:09.63,00:23:09.63,What do you say-- six ounces?
573,00:23:11.60,00:23:11.60,BUTCH: Not even.
574,00:23:13.13,00:23:13.13,"DAVE: You know,  for the past, past week or so,"
575,00:23:15.47,00:23:15.47, the focus has been really  on surviving
576,00:23:18.23,00:23:18.23, and how we're going  to make it out here.
577,00:23:19.60,00:23:19.60," And talking to Matt  this morning,"
578,00:23:20.97,00:23:20.97,it really came.
579,00:23:22.10,00:23:22.10,"You know, we're here to play a game"
580,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,and we're here to eliminate 15 other people.
581,00:23:26.23,00:23:26.23,ALEX: You caught a fish?
582,00:23:27.23,00:23:27.23,-MATTHEW: Three. -Three.
583,00:23:28.73,00:23:28.73,"All right, look at that, baby."
584,00:23:32.70,00:23:32.70,Nice. Nice.
585,00:23:35.83,00:23:35.83,"Um, and what was interesting in talking to Matt this morning"
586,00:23:37.97,00:23:37.97,was to hear him talk about how
587,00:23:40.33,00:23:40.33," Alex has been talking to Rob  about getting rid of Roger,"
588,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50," and, you know,  it kind of opened up my eyes."
589,00:23:47.03,00:23:47.03,There's a lot more going on behind the scenes
590,00:23:48.37,00:23:48.37,than I'm aware of.
591,00:23:49.70,00:23:49.70,"Guys, we got the momentum now, man... got the momentum."
592,00:23:52.87,00:23:52.87,ROB:  David and Matthew
593,00:23:55.17,00:23:55.17,went out on a fishing trip and brought back three guppies.
594,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67," And Matthew is like,  ""Oh, I'm going to make"
595,00:24:01.90,00:24:01.90," ""a fish bouillon soup, and it's so, it's so depressing"
596,00:24:06.40,00:24:06.40,"for a chef like myself without these seasonings."""
597,00:24:09.73,00:24:09.73,"We're going to have to wing it, guys."
598,00:24:10.97,00:24:10.97,"I mean, no utensils, no real service vessels."
599,00:24:15.23,00:24:15.23,It's going to be primitive.
600,00:24:17.37,00:24:17.37,We'll figure it out.
601,00:24:18.97,00:24:18.97,I think we can handle primitive.
602,00:24:20.73,00:24:20.73," I was like: Matt,"
603,00:24:21.73,00:24:21.73,"when I was in the fraternity,"
604,00:24:23.03,00:24:23.03,I would swallow fish that were bigger than this whole.
605,00:24:25.27,00:24:25.27,"-How we doing, fellas? -Did we get some flavor?"
606,00:24:27.23,00:24:27.23,MATTHEW: It's not a lot of flavor.
607,00:24:29.57,00:24:29.57,"You guys, I mean, I could put this broth"
608,00:24:31.73,00:24:31.73,back on the fire and concentrate it even more; it'd be better.
609,00:24:35.63,00:24:35.63,"Right now, it's pretty light."
610,00:24:39.20,00:24:39.20,Kind of tastes like wet manioc.
611,00:24:42.07,00:24:42.07,That was delicious.
612,00:24:44.03,00:24:44.03,"I must have got, like, the spine."
613,00:24:45.47,00:24:45.47,ALEX: It's kind of changed  a couple of times
614,00:24:47.13,00:24:47.13, over the last couple days.
615,00:24:48.40,00:24:48.40,"Rob has put on a good front for the whole crew,"
616,00:24:51.10,00:24:51.10,"other than, I think, me."
617,00:24:52.90,00:24:52.90," He came into this game,"
618,00:24:55.30,00:24:55.30, deciding that  he was going to play
619,00:24:56.97,00:24:56.97,like the goofy kid.
620,00:24:58.50,00:24:58.50,"I went to go visit my grandfather in the nursing home,"
621,00:25:01.20,00:25:01.20,"so I went and I said, ""Grandpa, how's it going?"""
622,00:25:04.03,00:25:04.03,"He said, ""Oh, it's crazy here."
623,00:25:05.97,00:25:05.97,"""Every night, before we go to bed,"
624,00:25:07.23,00:25:07.23,"they're giving us hot chocolate and Viagra."""
625,00:25:09.90,00:25:09.90,"I said, ""Hot chocolate and Viagra?"""
626,00:25:12.03,00:25:12.03,"ALEX: He really wanted  to get rid of Roger,"
627,00:25:13.50,00:25:13.50, and Roger had already come  to me and Butch and Dave.
628,00:25:17.20,00:25:17.20, We kind of all agreed  that Dan was next to go.
629,00:25:19.80,00:25:19.80," Well, then,"
630,00:25:21.03,00:25:21.03,"Rob came to me and wanted to get rid of Roger,"
631,00:25:24.73,00:25:24.73, and he had Dan and Matt.
632,00:25:27.57,00:25:27.57,So I'm kind of the swing.
633,00:25:28.77,00:25:28.77,I'm kind of the person-- I can decide.
634,00:25:30.40,00:25:30.40," I can go, ""Which one?"",  you know, and..."
635,00:25:34.97,00:25:34.97,I can go either way.
636,00:25:36.43,00:25:36.43,"He said, ""Yes, I'll explain, sir."
637,00:25:38.30,00:25:38.30,"""The hot chocolate is so they go to sleep,"
638,00:25:40.80,00:25:40.80,"and the Viagra is so they don't roll out of the bed."""
639,00:25:43.27,00:25:43.27,(chuckles)
640,00:25:47.53,00:25:47.53,(sighs)
641,00:26:04.03,00:26:04.03,SHAWNA:  Jaburu is on the upswing.
642,00:26:24.50,00:26:24.50, Deena did an amazing job
643,00:26:26.13,00:26:26.13, taking up the role of leadership within our tribe.
644,00:26:28.50,00:26:28.50,"DEENA: Then after breakfast, we'll all go get palm fronds,"
645,00:26:30.50,00:26:30.50,"and then the next two can go out fishing, if they want."
646,00:26:33.17,00:26:33.17,"SHAWNA:  She's got her stuff together,"
647,00:26:34.57,00:26:34.57, and she knows how to delegate.
648,00:26:37.07,00:26:37.07,"DEENA: Fix these posts right here, and then..."
649,00:26:38.33,00:26:38.33,"SHAWNA: And, sometimes,  she can come off bossy,"
650,00:26:40.27,00:26:40.27," but you realized  you picked her,"
651,00:26:42.70,00:26:42.70,"and that's the reason you picked her,"
652,00:26:43.97,00:26:43.97,is 'cause you want her to boss you around.
653,00:26:46.03,00:26:46.03,-Christy? -What's up?
654,00:26:47.27,00:26:47.27,I really need you to work on the fire shelter
655,00:26:49.30,00:26:49.30,and then the roof.
656,00:26:50.90,00:26:50.90,Okay.
657,00:26:52.30,00:26:52.30,DEENA: The net effect of the leadership has been that
658,00:26:54.83,00:26:54.83," we have, so far,  boiled five pots of water;"
659,00:26:58.17,00:26:58.17, there is the roof that is  pretty much completed;
660,00:27:01.60,00:27:01.60, and the camp has been
661,00:27:03.03,00:27:03.03," completely cleared out  of debris,"
662,00:27:04.80,00:27:04.80,so that it looks like it's organized.
663,00:27:06.27,00:27:06.27,"Like, it looks as if somebody, yes, lives there"
664,00:27:09.03,00:27:09.03,and cares about their environment
665,00:27:10.67,00:27:10.67,and is going to take care of it.
666,00:27:12.30,00:27:12.30,"JOANNA: Uh-huh, come on..."
667,00:27:13.80,00:27:13.80,"CHRISTY: Get it, get it, bring it up, bring it up."
668,00:27:15.80,00:27:15.80,"-Yeah, dawg. -All right!"
669,00:27:17.97,00:27:17.97,DEENA:  We're not starving to death.
670,00:27:19.27,00:27:19.27," Some of the girls  have been catching fish,"
671,00:27:20.90,00:27:20.90,and I think that that's a huge source of protein.
672,00:27:23.03,00:27:23.03," It was what we needed  to get us at par,"
673,00:27:26.77,00:27:26.77,so that we could play the game against the men.
674,00:27:29.03,00:27:29.03,CHRISTY: Ah! I caught my first fish in the Amazon!
675,00:27:32.10,00:27:32.10,JOANNA: \xe2\x99\xaa Hallelujah! \xe2\x99\xaa
676,00:27:34.43,00:27:34.43,"\xe2\x99\xaa Oh, glory! \xe2\x99\xaa"
677,00:27:36.37,00:27:36.37,I can actually go fishing.
678,00:27:38.53,00:27:38.53,"Oh, my God, that's humongous!"
679,00:27:42.63,00:27:42.63,"Oh, shoot! I got to put him up here."
680,00:27:44.93,00:27:44.93,Bring the machete. Help me 'cause he's a big one.
681,00:27:47.33,00:27:47.33,"-Whoa!... -Uh, I handled it."
682,00:27:49.27,00:27:49.27,I am...
683,00:27:51.77,00:27:51.77,"Do it, Jesus."
684,00:27:52.87,00:27:52.87,"Look, that's my Jesus."
685,00:27:54.13,00:27:54.13,(laughs)

702,00:28:42.50,00:28:42.50,Whoo!
703,00:28:43.87,00:28:43.87,I'm so excited we're going to challenge.
704,00:28:46.07,00:28:46.07,I really have a good feeling inside
705,00:28:48.73,00:28:48.73,that we're going to beat them boys.
706,00:28:52.90,00:28:52.90,I'm ready.

716,00:29:29.03,00:29:29.03,Will Jenna give the old man here the look?

727,00:30:05.30,00:30:05.30,Okay. I will take back the immunity idol.
728,00:30:09.13,00:30:09.13,"Clearly, with a very arrogant addition, I would say."
729,00:30:11.53,00:30:11.53,Thoughts when you see the  immunity idol with their colors?
730,00:30:14.67,00:30:14.67,We'd like to remind them we had it first.
731,00:30:17.00,00:30:17.00,Yeah.
732,00:30:18.00,00:30:18.00,And we'll remove it later.
733,00:30:19.30,00:30:19.30,(chuckling)
734,00:30:20.40,00:30:20.40,"Okay, when you guys agreed"

736,00:30:24.77,00:30:24.77,you basically agreed to be trapped with strangers.
737,00:30:28.63,00:30:28.63,Today's challenge epitomizes that.
738,00:30:31.43,00:30:31.43,You are going to be trapped in a cage.
739,00:30:34.13,00:30:34.13,There's an escape hatch at the top.
740,00:30:35.87,00:30:35.87,"To get to it, you're going to have to make your way"
741,00:30:37.83,00:30:37.83,through a rope web of knots until you release a machete.
742,00:30:41.60,00:30:41.60,"Next, you'll find ten more knots."
743,00:30:44.30,00:30:44.30,"Once you've untied those knots, use the machete"
744,00:30:46.50,00:30:46.50,"to cut the correct rope, then slide the board out."
745,00:30:48.13,00:30:48.13,That'll release a pole.
746,00:30:49.93,00:30:49.93,Use the pole to retrieve three sets of keys.
747,00:30:53.97,00:30:53.97,Use the keys to unlock the locks and open the hatch.
748,00:30:56.57,00:30:56.57,First tribe to open the hatch wins immunity.
749,00:30:59.77,00:30:59.77,"If everybody in your tribe does not work together,"
750,00:31:03.00,00:31:03.00,"you will go to Tribal Council,"
751,00:31:04.50,00:31:04.50,and somebody from your tribe will be going home tonight.
752,00:31:06.93,00:31:06.93,"All right, everybody get in your cages-- I'll lock you in."
753,00:31:15.60,00:31:15.60,For immunity.

757,00:31:21.60,00:31:21.60,Pull this.

762,00:31:32.33,00:31:32.33,all you have to do is release that machete.
763,00:31:35.73,00:31:35.73,I don't know if I'm doing any good.
764,00:31:37.20,00:31:37.20,"-Pull it, pull it, pull it. -That a way, Tambaqui."
765,00:31:38.60,00:31:38.60,"-Dave, I finally went... -Nice."
766,00:31:40.13,00:31:40.13,"-I found it... -Okay, we got this through."
767,00:31:41.80,00:31:41.80,PROBST: Jaburu with two knots undone on the machete.
768,00:31:44.63,00:31:44.63,Tambaqui with both knots undone on the machete.
769,00:31:47.73,00:31:47.73,We're down to one knot left.
770,00:31:49.07,00:31:49.07,I can take it. I can take it. I can...
771,00:31:50.77,00:31:50.77,It's right here. It goes right through this one.
772,00:31:52.50,00:31:52.50,-Keep pulling. Keep pulling. -I can't.
773,00:31:53.70,00:31:53.70,She's pulling the other way.
774,00:31:55.30,00:31:55.30,"It's Jenna first, then Christy."
775,00:31:57.17,00:31:57.17,It's going to get into a knot if we pull like that.
776,00:31:58.73,00:31:58.73,"All right, hold it, Alex. Pull, pull, pull."
777,00:32:00.37,00:32:00.37,Someone feed that.
778,00:32:01.57,00:32:01.57,"Someone feed it, or it's going to get stuck."
779,00:32:02.93,00:32:02.93,"-I got it. I got it. -Alex, good."
780,00:32:04.10,00:32:04.10,"Good move, Alex."

783,00:32:08.20,00:32:08.20,"I got the machete, guys. I got the machete."
784,00:32:09.47,00:32:09.47,"-Okay. -PROBST: Once that machete's free,"
785,00:32:11.07,00:32:11.07,-you're fine to use it. -You go inside.
786,00:32:13.20,00:32:13.20,-I'll go outside. -Jaburu has their machete free.

805,00:32:45.53,00:32:45.53,"Here. Here, you hold it. I'll saw the rope."
806,00:32:47.63,00:32:47.63,"-Okay. -Here we go, Joanna."
807,00:32:48.80,00:32:48.80,"It's all you, babe. It's all you."
808,00:32:50.07,00:32:50.07,You got it. Good job.
809,00:32:52.13,00:32:52.13,"PROBST: Tambaqui, still trying to get out of their first stage."

813,00:33:03.63,00:33:03.63,-You got a lock. -I what?
814,00:33:05.50,00:33:05.50,"-You are on that lock. -Yeah, okay."
815,00:33:07.33,00:33:07.33,There you go. There you go. Work it.
816,00:33:08.93,00:33:08.93,"Good job, Joanna. Good job."

821,00:33:18.37,00:33:18.37,Jaburu is working on their keys.
822,00:33:20.03,00:33:20.03,"Tambaqui, still stuck on first stage."
823,00:33:22.43,00:33:22.43,"Jaburu has two locks undone, one lock remaining."

828,00:33:36.40,00:33:36.40,PROBST: Tambaqui still on stage one.
829,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,Jaburu on their last lock.
830,00:33:40.67,00:33:40.67,Push it back. Push it back. Push it back.
831,00:33:43.90,00:33:43.90,-Pull it! -Immunity: Jaburu!

835,00:33:59.13,00:33:59.13,Who wants it?
836,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,"Wait. I'm sorry, guys."
837,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,You... you forgot something.
838,00:34:04.90,00:34:04.90,"-Oh, that's right. -That's okay."
839,00:34:06.03,00:34:06.03,Hey... thank you.
840,00:34:07.50,00:34:07.50,"PROBST: Jaburu, congratulations."
841,00:34:09.73,00:34:09.73,Immunity; no Tribal Council tonight.
842,00:34:11.63,00:34:11.63,-Three more days in the Amazon. -Whoo!
843,00:34:13.33,00:34:13.33,Yeah!
844,00:34:14.57,00:34:14.57,"PROBST: Tambaqui, sadly, not the same news for you."
845,00:34:17.37,00:34:17.37,Tribal Council tonight.
846,00:34:18.70,00:34:18.70,Somebody else going home.
847,00:34:22.10,00:34:22.10,(cheering)
848,00:34:25.13,00:34:25.13,Alleluia!
849,00:34:42.60,00:34:42.60,"Man, I want to lose it every now and then, but..."
850,00:34:46.50,00:34:46.50,"Hey, this hurts. There's no doubt about it."
851,00:34:48.03,00:34:48.03,"-It stings. -Yeah, I'm not sure how evenly matched we are,"
852,00:34:50.03,00:34:50.03,having dropped four out of five challenges.
853,00:34:51.93,00:34:51.93,The Lord is on their side.
854,00:34:54.23,00:34:54.23,Yeah. Uh-huh.
855,00:35:04.77,00:35:04.77,Dan is looking for... to get the votes to go for you tonight.
856,00:35:10.23,00:35:10.23,Whoa!
857,00:35:11.37,00:35:11.37,I wasn't in on it.
858,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,ROB:  Roger has told me
859,00:35:14.67,00:35:14.67, that he is at his wit's end  with Daniel
860,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53, and that he may be very close
861,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,"to bursting, and I hope that happens."
862,00:35:20.93,00:35:20.93,I know that any time any two people in the tribe
863,00:35:23.80,00:35:23.80,"are butting heads, that's good for business."
864,00:35:26.43,00:35:26.43,Who do you think Alex is going to vote for?
865,00:35:28.03,00:35:28.03,I think Alex is going to vote for Roger.
866,00:35:29.47,00:35:29.47,"-Yeah. Yeah. -A couple days ago, I thought it was going to be"
867,00:35:31.53,00:35:31.53,"-you and then me, but I think we're going to be... -All right."
868,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,I think we're going to be here for a little bit.
869,00:35:35.63,00:35:35.63,Roger's a pain in the ass.
870,00:35:36.90,00:35:36.90,"-Yeah, he is a pain in the ass. -Yeah."
871,00:35:38.57,00:35:38.57,"All right, I'm going to walk back to camp,"
872,00:35:40.27,00:35:40.27,but don't walk back... don't walk back with me.
873,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,DANIEL: Yeah. Yeah.
874,00:35:44.43,00:35:44.43,DANIEL: I'm just trying  to realign right now
875,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47," with Rob, Alex and Matthew,  and Rob really"
876,00:35:50.07,00:35:50.07," wants Roger to go,  but Rob will only vote"
877,00:35:53.50,00:35:53.50,against Roger as long as the... the numbers are there.
878,00:35:56.20,00:35:56.20,"Rob, of course, approached me, and then Matt."
879,00:35:58.03,00:35:58.03,"He's going to try to save me, you know, if he..."
880,00:36:00.63,00:36:00.63,"whatever he can, but he can't really do it much himself."
881,00:36:02.93,00:36:02.93,Right.
882,00:36:04.00,00:36:04.00,So it's just all up in the air.
883,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,"Wherever you vote, Rob's going to vote."
884,00:36:08.13,00:36:08.13,"That's what he told me, so..."
885,00:36:10.40,00:36:10.40,"-Hmm. -You vote for me, he votes for me."
886,00:36:12.70,00:36:12.70,"-Hmm. -Vote for Roger, you... he votes for Roger."
887,00:36:15.10,00:36:15.10,Whatever.
888,00:36:17.47,00:36:17.47,"DAVE: Because it is  relatively early in the game,"
889,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50, I don't really trust anybody.
890,00:36:20.93,00:36:20.93," We still are out here  as a game,"
891,00:36:23.47,00:36:23.47, and to hear Matthew talk  about how Alex
892,00:36:26.93,00:36:26.93,"seems to be trying to be everybody's friends,"
893,00:36:29.13,00:36:29.13,"and-and get on different sides,"
894,00:36:31.73,00:36:31.73,"it made me wonder, what am I missing?"
895,00:36:34.93,00:36:34.93,"One for Dan, one for Roger."
896,00:36:36.87,00:36:36.87,"-One for Dan, one for Roger. -One Dan, one for Roger."
897,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,"Two for Dan, two for Roger."
898,00:36:43.53,00:36:43.53,Yeah.
899,00:36:44.70,00:36:44.70,And then three in a row for Dan.
900,00:36:46.97,00:36:46.97,Good night.
901,00:36:51.63,00:36:51.63,ROGER: And that will be that.
902,00:36:53.57,00:36:53.57,Mm-hmm.
903,00:37:26.03,00:37:26.03,How you guys feeling?
904,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,Rob?
905,00:37:28.63,00:37:28.63,I don't think any of us are feeling that great.
906,00:37:30.60,00:37:30.60,"We're at Tribal Council for the second time,"
907,00:37:32.80,00:37:32.80,which is two more times than any of us had wanted to be here.
908,00:37:35.63,00:37:35.63,"So I think we're feeling pretty lousy right now, Jeff."
909,00:37:38.20,00:37:38.20,"-How about you, Dave? -Eight guys"
910,00:37:40.00,00:37:40.00,"certainly don't like to lose against eight girls,"
911,00:37:42.20,00:37:42.20,"and, uh, we had a slow start,"
912,00:37:44.30,00:37:44.30,"but, uh, I really... I'm-I'm fully confident"
913,00:37:46.57,00:37:46.57,"that we can come back and, uh,"
914,00:37:48.07,00:37:48.07,pull some big wins in the near future.
915,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"PROBST: Roger, do you feel a little"
916,00:37:51.63,00:37:51.63,like Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King?
917,00:37:54.00,00:37:54.00,You're letting down an entire gender here.
918,00:37:56.70,00:37:56.70,"We did everything as best we could, and..."
919,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,"hey, they beat us, so..."
920,00:38:01.43,00:38:01.43,"PROBST: Matthew, how about you?"
921,00:38:02.53,00:38:02.53,"How hungry, scale of one to ten?"
922,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,I'm about an eight.
923,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33,-That's pretty hungry. -Manioc is getting very old.
924,00:38:08.37,00:38:08.37,I have a hard time keeping it down.
925,00:38:10.60,00:38:10.60,"How about you, Alex?"
926,00:38:11.97,00:38:11.97,About the same as Matthew.
927,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,"I'm up there at eight, maybe even a nine."
928,00:38:15.80,00:38:15.80,"Mm-- I'm hungry, and I'm feeling it."
929,00:38:18.90,00:38:18.90,"Daniel, how about the fishing?"
930,00:38:20.20,00:38:20.20,How many hours a day are you guys working on that?
931,00:38:21.93,00:38:21.93,"We're actually going out there a couple hours a day, at least."
932,00:38:24.47,00:38:24.47,How many hours of daylight you figure you get out here?
933,00:38:26.80,00:38:26.80,About ten.
934,00:38:28.03,00:38:28.03,"PROBST: Roger, did you fish today?"
935,00:38:29.73,00:38:29.73,"Uh, no. I'm not a fisherman."
936,00:38:31.13,00:38:31.13,-PROBST: Matthew? -I did fish today.
937,00:38:33.00,00:38:33.00,-How long? -Fished for about an hour.
938,00:38:35.53,00:38:35.53,"Would you say it's fair to say, ""Hey, Jeff,"
939,00:38:38.20,00:38:38.20,"""if you were watching us, you'd see we are putting forth"
940,00:38:40.57,00:38:40.57,"everything we can to try and figure this out?"""
941,00:38:42.47,00:38:42.47,I think we could spend more time out there.
942,00:38:45.20,00:38:45.20,Let's talk about friendships.
943,00:38:46.93,00:38:46.93,"Daniel, feeling any bond with any of these guys?"
944,00:38:50.10,00:38:50.10,"Well, the person I get along with the best is Matthew."
945,00:38:52.87,00:38:52.87,"He was born in... in Hong Kong, so..."
946,00:38:55.07,00:38:55.07,he's probably more Chinese than I am.
947,00:38:56.60,00:38:56.60,"And, uh, he knows how to speak Chinese,"
948,00:38:58.30,00:38:58.30,so that's a definite plus.
949,00:38:59.97,00:38:59.97,"Um, I'm different than anybody else."
950,00:39:02.30,00:39:02.30,I'm one Asian guy versus seven other white guys.
951,00:39:05.43,00:39:05.43,"Even though I was born and raised in the U.S.,"
952,00:39:07.53,00:39:07.53,"you know, just, even before I speak,"
953,00:39:09.63,00:39:09.63,"I stand out from the rest,"
954,00:39:10.90,00:39:10.90,and sometimes that makes me an outcast.
955,00:39:12.63,00:39:12.63,ROB: That is completely false.
956,00:39:15.00,00:39:15.00,I don't think for one second any of us said
957,00:39:18.13,00:39:18.13,"that we're going to treat Daniel any differently because his,"
958,00:39:20.90,00:39:20.90,"uh, relatives are from a different country"
959,00:39:22.43,00:39:22.43,than our relatives may be from.
960,00:39:23.80,00:39:23.80,We're all from different places and from
961,00:39:26.23,00:39:26.23,"different backgrounds, and we all realize"
962,00:39:28.63,00:39:28.63,that everybody's different and that's what makes us unique.
963,00:39:31.87,00:39:31.87,"PROBST: Roger, you were shaking your head a little bit."
964,00:39:33.40,00:39:33.40,"What's your assessment? I mean, obviously, there's friction"
965,00:39:36.10,00:39:36.10,-between you two guys. -ROGER: My frustration with Dan
966,00:39:38.87,00:39:38.87,"started, uh, when I asked him"
967,00:39:40.60,00:39:40.60,"to go down to the lake and get the water,"
968,00:39:42.43,00:39:42.43,"and he kind of hesitated and, you know,"
969,00:39:44.67,00:39:44.67,"""You need to help me,"" kind of a deal."
970,00:39:46.77,00:39:46.77,"So I said, ""Screw it, buddy. I'll go down and get it myself."""
971,00:39:50.20,00:39:50.20,"Well, in defense to... to what Roger said, uh,"
972,00:39:52.63,00:39:52.63,he's been barking orders like a drill sergeant since day one.
973,00:39:55.37,00:39:55.37,"Um... I mean, he doesn't... he doesn't ask nicely, you know?"
974,00:39:59.10,00:39:59.10,"So I said, ""Fine. You want to do it, go right ahead."""
975,00:40:06.03,00:40:06.03,So friendship's out the window.
976,00:40:09.37,00:40:09.37,It is time to vote.
977,00:40:10.53,00:40:10.53,"Daniel, you're first."
978,00:40:22.27,00:40:22.27,"Roger, you've been out here six days too long."
979,00:40:24.73,00:40:24.73,Talk to you later.
980,00:40:35.70,00:40:35.70,"Dan, I think I pretty much said it at Tribal Council."
981,00:40:39.20,00:40:39.20,"You're out of your element,"
982,00:40:40.87,00:40:40.87, and you have not been  a team player.
983,00:41:09.03,00:41:09.03,I'll go tally the votes.
984,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
985,00:41:25.17,00:41:25.17,Person voted out will be asked to leave
986,00:41:26.87,00:41:26.87,the Tribal Council area immediately.
987,00:41:28.57,00:41:28.57,I'll read the votes.
988,00:41:33.67,00:41:33.67,First vote.
989,00:41:36.37,00:41:36.37,Dan.
990,00:41:41.87,00:41:41.87,"Roger. That's one vote Roger, one vote Dan."
991,00:41:48.77,00:41:48.77,Dan. That's two votes.
992,00:41:52.43,00:41:52.43,Three votes Dan.
993,00:42:02.37,00:42:02.37,Dan. That's four votes.
994,00:42:04.33,00:42:04.33,That's enough. Need to bring me your torch.
995,00:42:15.93,00:42:15.93,"Daniel, the tribe has spoken."
996,00:42:18.40,00:42:18.40,It's time for you to go.
997,00:42:32.73,00:42:32.73,You guys have lost four out of five challenges.
998,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,I think you guys know what you need to do--
999,00:42:36.73,00:42:36.73,you just need to go do it.
