504,00:35:38.90,00:35:38.90,HAD BEEN TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGESTSTRATEGIC THREAT AND I KNOW SHE
505,00:35:43.87,00:35:43.87,DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY AND I KNOWSHE'S NOT EXPECTING IT AND I
506,00:35:47.03,00:35:47.03,KNOW IT WILL ONLY TAKE THREEVOTES TO GET HER TO GO HOME
507,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,TONIGHT.>> WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS MAYBE I'M
508,00:35:51.03,00:35:51.03,A LITTLE BIT SWAYED BY COCHRAN'SEMOTION AND LAST TIME I LEFT MY
509,00:35:55.03,00:35:55.03,GAME A LITTLE BIT IN HIS HANDSAND HE CONTROLLED IT AND I WENT
510,00:35:58.47,00:35:58.47,HOME BEFORE HIM AND I DON'T WANTTO DO THAT THIS TIME.
