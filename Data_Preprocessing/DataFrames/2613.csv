365,00:25:25.00,00:25:25.00,WE'RE AT THAT POINT IN THE GAME WHERE LIKABILITY IS A LIABILITY
366,00:25:27.70,00:25:27.70,AND I KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE AND I THINK BRENDA

398,00:28:10.47,00:28:10.47,OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE. I WANT TO WIN IT BUT IF EDDIE
399,00:28:13.00,00:28:13.00,WINS IMMUNITY IT'S GOING TO BE A PRETTY STRESSFUL DAY AT CAMP.
400,00:28:17.53,00:28:17.53,">> YOU GO FIRST, BUDDY. >> Jeff: EDDY IS THIS A BATTLE"

406,00:28:40.50,00:28:40.50,TIME TO LOWER YOU AGAIN. EDDIE NOW REALLY STRUGGLING.

408,00:29:12.17,00:29:12.17,OF A CHALLENGE THAT MIGHT DO HIM IN.

410,00:29:20.17,00:29:20.17,"WE ARE DOWN TO THREE: DAWN, SHERRI, AND BRENDA."
411,00:29:26.53,00:29:26.53,PART OF THIS CHALLENGE AT THIS POINT IS NOT LETTING ANYONE ELSE
412,00:29:30.40,00:29:30.40,KNOW HOW YOU'RE REALLY FEELING. SHERRI STRUGGLING TO DO THAT.
413,00:29:33.40,00:29:33.40,>> CAN'T DO IT. AND SHERRI IS NOW OUT OF THE
414,00:29:38.30,00:29:38.30,CHALLENGE. >> I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE ALL

424,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,LET ME HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. >> YES.
425,00:30:08.50,00:30:08.50,BUT THAT'S OKAY. I KNOW BRENDA WANTS TO CHALLENGE
426,00:30:10.83,00:30:10.83,HERSELF AND I RESPECT IT. >> Jeff: DOWN TO TWO.
427,00:30:16.37,00:30:16.37,"THE DAWN ON ONE END, BRENDA ON THE OTHER."
428,00:30:19.07,00:30:19.07,GOING TO LOWER YOU A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE WATER.
429,00:30:21.70,00:30:21.70,HERE WE GO. BOTH WOMEN WAY OUT THERE.
430,00:30:43.03,00:30:43.03,"BOTH WOMEN FIGHTING THAT GRIP, TRYING TO HOLD ON, KEEP THAT"
431,00:30:48.10,00:30:48.10,BLOOD PUMPING THROUGH THERE. THIS IS IT.
432,00:30:51.27,00:30:51.27,THE TWO WOMEN WHO DID NOT SPEND TIME WITH THEIR LOVED ONES
433,00:30:55.13,00:30:55.13,BATTLING IT OUT. >> YES!
434,00:31:07.20,00:31:07.20,JUST LIKE THAT BRENDA CANNOT HANG ON.
435,00:31:10.50,00:31:10.50,DAWN WINS IMMUNITY AND IS GUARANTEED A SPOT IN THE FINAL
436,00:31:15.37,00:31:15.37,FIVE! >> THAT WAS CLOSE.
437,00:31:17.20,00:31:17.20,">> ALL RIGHT, DAWN, COME ON OVER."
438,00:31:19.13,00:31:19.13,(APPLAUSE) FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER
439,00:31:26.63,00:31:26.63,"""SURVIVOR"" CAREER, DAWN IS WEARING THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE."
440,00:31:30.47,00:31:30.47,DAWN IS SAFE AFTER 36 DAYS IN THIS GAME.
441,00:31:32.60,00:31:32.60,YOU WILL LIVE TO SAY DAY 37. YOU HAVE A SPOT IN THE FINAL
442,00:31:37.40,00:31:37.40,"FIVE. UNFORTUNATELY EDDIE, COCHRAN,"
443,00:31:39.73,00:31:39.73,"BRENDA, ERIK, SHERRI, ONE OF YOU GOING HOME TONIGHT."
444,00:31:42.97,00:31:42.97,"GRAB YOUR STUFF, HEAD BACK TO CAMP, SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL,"
445,00:31:46.23,00:31:46.23,CONGRATS. >> THANK YOU!
446,00:31:48.10,00:31:48.10,"YAY! >> I NEVER, EVER WANT TO BE THAT"
447,00:31:50.33,00:31:50.33,PERSON THAT JUMPS INTO THE WATER THAT GIVES UP IMMUNITY.
448,00:31:54.27,00:31:54.27,IF THAT WAS EDDIE UP THERE I WOULD HAVE HUNG ON A LOT LONGER.
449,00:31:58.53,00:31:58.53,"BUT SOMEONE AS PARANOID AS DAWN, GOT TO KEEP HER HAPPY, JUMPED IN"
450,00:32:02.40,00:32:02.40,THE WATER. IT WAS ALL GOOD.
451,00:32:31.87,00:32:31.87,THAT FELT GOOD. >> THE WHOLE CHALLENGE TODAY WAS
452,00:32:33.97,00:32:33.97,TO MAKE SURE EDDIE DIDN'T WIN IMMUNITY AND AS SOON AS EDDIE
453,00:32:37.03,00:32:37.03,JUMPED IN THE WATER IT WAS LIKE GLEE ALL OVER MY FACE.
454,00:32:39.77,00:32:39.77,I HAVE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE I FELT BAD SHOWING HOW HAPPY I WAS
455,00:32:44.63,00:32:44.63,>> MY ARMS FEEL LIKE SPAGHETTI. >> I THINK IT'S A
456,00:32:48.30,00:32:48.30,STRAIGHTFORWARD VOTE TONIGHT. EDDIE'S GOING HOME AND AFTER
457,00:32:52.17,00:32:52.17,EDDIE THE PLAN IS TO TAKE OUT COCHRAN.
458,00:32:54.40,00:32:54.40,IN MY HEAD IT'S THE PERFECT PLAN IF WE CAN JUST STICK TO IT
459,00:32:57.93,00:32:57.93,EVERYTHING WILL GO AMAZING. THIS IS EXTREMELY
460,00:33:05.87,00:33:05.87,STRAIGHTFORWARD. I KNOW IT.
461,00:33:06.83,00:33:06.83,>> YUP. >> RIGHT?
462,00:33:08.03,00:33:08.03,>> YUP. >> IF I HAD MY PICK BETWEEN
463,00:33:12.50,00:33:12.50,"EDDIE AND BRENDA, PERSONALLY I'D LIKE TO HAVE BRENDA GO."
464,00:33:16.73,00:33:16.73,I THINK IT'S A GREAT MOVE THAT BENEFITS ME AND EVEN INDIRECTLY
465,00:33:20.97,00:33:20.97,"BENEFITS DAWN AND SHERRI. BUT I'M THINKING, OKAY, THE"
466,00:33:23.57,00:33:23.57,PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT EVERYBODY IS SO GUNG-HO ABOUT
467,00:33:25.97,00:33:25.97,GETTING EDDIE OUT. IT'S A FOREGONE CONCLUSION WHEN
468,00:33:29.60,00:33:29.60,WE GOT BACK TO CAMP SO I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY
469,00:33:32.40,00:33:32.40,HARD SELL. SOME THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'VE
470,00:33:36.43,00:33:36.43,"GUARANTEED OURSELVES FINAL FOUR. LIKE, YOU REALIZE THAT, RIGHT?"
471,00:33:39.20,00:33:39.20,>> YES. ABSOLUTELY.
472,00:33:45.77,00:33:45.77,>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT. I'M RUNNING THROUGH IT.
473,00:33:48.63,00:33:48.63,>> CAN I GUESS WHAT YOUR SCENARIO IS GOING TO BE?
474,00:33:51.40,00:33:51.40,>> SURE. >> BLIND SIDE BRENDA TONIGHT.
475,00:33:54.10,00:33:54.10,>> YEAH. >> BECAUSE SHE'D NEVER SEE IT
476,00:33:56.07,00:33:56.07,COMING. I WAS ALREADY THERE.
477,00:33:57.23,00:33:57.23,>> IT IS THE PERFECT MOVE BECAUSE TONIGHT IS THE PERFECT
478,00:34:00.07,00:34:00.07,NIGHT TO MAKE IT. IF BRENDA HAD ONE MORE DAY IN
479,00:34:02.40,00:34:02.40,THIS GAME SHE COULD UPSET EVERYTHING.
480,00:34:03.93,00:34:03.93,THERE ARE ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT. SHE COULD GO ON A WINNING STREAK
481,00:34:07.17,00:34:07.17,"WIN AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL, I'M MAKING SURE THAT DOESN'T"
482,00:34:10.60,00:34:10.60,HAPPEN. BRENDA IS A BIG THREAT.
483,00:34:12.80,00:34:12.80,>> AGREED AND WE KNOW SHE'S -- >> SHE HASN'T BETRAYED A SINGLE
484,00:34:18.40,00:34:18.40,"PERSON, SHE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONES, SHE WON"
485,00:34:22.13,00:34:22.13,IMMUNITY. >> SO LET'S SAY THAT LEAVES
486,00:34:25.03,00:34:25.03,EDDIE AND EDDIE WINS THE LAST CHALLENGE AND THEN WE'RE LEFT AT
487,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,KIND OF THE MERCY OF EDDIE'S DECISION MAKING ON WHO GOES TO
488,00:34:34.37,00:34:34.37,THE END. >> YOU THINK EDDIE STAYING IN
489,00:34:36.90,00:34:36.90,THE GAME IS A BIG THREAT? >> THERE IS A PART OF ME THAT MY
490,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,GUT TELLS ME BRENDA'S KIND OF STAY THE COURSE.
491,00:34:43.90,00:34:43.90,EVERYTHING'S FALLEN INTO PLACE SO I'M GUESSING IN HER MIND
492,00:34:48.40,00:34:48.40,"SHE'S THINKING EDDIE CAME DOWN TODAY, NEXT WILL BE EITHER"
493,00:34:53.50,00:34:53.50,SHERRI OR COCHRAN. SHE'S NOT MARRIED TO IT.
494,00:34:56.33,00:34:56.33,"I MEAN, WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO GET HARD YOU KNOW?"
495,00:34:59.47,00:34:59.47,I'M STILL LOCKED TO YOU BUT I DIDN'T PLAY MY OWN GAME LAST
496,00:35:02.57,00:35:02.57,TIME SO I'M TRYING TO AND IT'S JUST HARD.
497,00:35:06.33,00:35:06.33,THIS IS A POINT WHERE THERE'S A FORK.
498,00:35:09.00,00:35:09.00,THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS WE TAKE EDDIE OUT TONIGHT LIKE WE
499,00:35:13.57,00:35:13.57,"SAY AND WE DEAL WITH THIS EXACT SAME THING TOMORROW, RIGHT?"
500,00:35:17.37,00:35:17.37,">> OKAY, WE CAN STICK WITH EDDIE THEN."
501,00:35:25.77,00:35:25.77,>> THERE IS THE KIND OF THE PART WHERE IT'S SO EASY TO GET RID OF
502,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,BRENDA IT'S TANTALIZING. >> AGREED.
503,00:35:32.70,00:35:32.70,ORIGINALLY I THOUGHT VOTE OUT EDDIE BUT BRENDA IS THE BIGGEST
504,00:35:36.20,00:35:36.20,STRATEGIC THREAT IN THIS GAME TO WIN IT AND MY APPROACH ALL ALONG
505,00:35:38.90,00:35:38.90,HAD BEEN TO TAKE OUT THE BIGGEST STRATEGIC THREAT AND I KNOW SHE
506,00:35:43.87,00:35:43.87,DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY AND I KNOW SHE'S NOT EXPECTING IT AND I
507,00:35:47.03,00:35:47.03,KNOW IT WILL ONLY TAKE THREE VOTES TO GET HER TO GO HOME
508,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,TONIGHT. >> WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS MAYBE I'M
509,00:35:51.03,00:35:51.03,A LITTLE BIT SWAYED BY COCHRAN'S EMOTION AND LAST TIME I LEFT MY
510,00:35:55.03,00:35:55.03,GAME A LITTLE BIT IN HIS HANDS AND HE CONTROLLED IT AND I WENT
511,00:35:58.47,00:35:58.47,HOME BEFORE HIM AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT THIS TIME.
512,00:36:07.37,00:36:07.37,I'M REALLY CONFUSED. >> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE
513,00:36:21.20,00:36:21.20,"MEMBERS OF OUR JURY. MIKE, PHILLIP, MALCOLM, REYNOLD"
514,00:36:29.53,00:36:29.53,AND ANDREA VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
515,00:36:36.93,00:36:36.93,"SO, DAWN, WEARING THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME"
516,00:36:40.07,00:36:40.07,"AFTER ALL THE DAYS YOU'VE PLAYED THIS THIS GAME, HOW DOES IT"
517,00:36:43.17,00:36:43.17,"FEEL? >> YEAH, IT FEELS GOOD COME TO"
518,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,TRIBAL COUNCIL AND JUST BREATHE AND JUST NOT WORRY SO MUCH.
519,00:36:49.23,00:36:49.23,I'M GLAD TO BE SAFE BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING IT WAS A FEELING
520,00:36:51.47,00:36:51.47,"OF I DID THAT, I TRAINED FOR THIS GAME AND I CAME AND DID"
521,00:36:56.03,00:36:56.03,SOMETHING IT'S LIKE A BUCKETLESS THING.
522,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,">> BRENDA, WHAT'S THE FEELING WHERE YOU KNOW I'M AT MY END AND"
523,00:37:03.83,00:37:03.83,THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON LEFT? >> IN THIS CASE IT WAS OKAY
524,00:37:08.03,00:37:08.03,BECAUSE IT WAS DAWN. I WANTED HER TO WIN IT VERSUS ME
525,00:37:10.80,00:37:10.80,JUST JUMPING OFF AND I THOUGHT I'VE GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES MAX
526,00:37:15.53,00:37:15.53,ON THIS THING AND THEN I FELL OFF.
527,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,">> Jeff: SO EDDIE, ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU FELT THE PRESSURE-- AS"
528,00:37:21.53,00:37:21.53,YOU HAVE GOING BACK TO DAY ONE-- BUT YOU NEEDED TO WIN.
529,00:37:25.40,00:37:25.40,>> ABSOLUTELY. IF I DIDN'T WIN I WAS PROBABLY
530,00:37:27.80,00:37:27.80,PACKING MY BAGS FOR THE LAST TIME AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
531,00:37:30.17,00:37:30.17,>> Jeff: AND YET HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SAID THAT AT TRIBAL?
532,00:37:32.97,00:37:32.97,">> YEAH, I KNOW, KIND OF LIKE A BROKEN RECORD."
533,00:37:36.70,00:37:36.70,BUT MY AMIGO FUSE IS RUNNING A LITTLE BIT SHORT.
534,00:37:39.80,00:37:39.80,>> Jeff: SO THERE WAS ANOTHER BIG EVENT.
535,00:37:42.37,00:37:42.37,FINALLY THE LOVED ONES. BRENDA GETS TO THE LOVED ONE
536,00:37:47.07,00:37:47.07,CHALLENGE AND YOU WIN AND YOU'RE FACED WITH A BIG DILEMMA.
537,00:37:50.27,00:37:50.27,">> TO JUST THINK WOW, MY GOD, I'M STANDING NEXT TO MY DAD AND"
538,00:37:53.60,00:37:53.60,THEN MY SISTER IS HERE AND THEN THE DILEMMA COMES.
