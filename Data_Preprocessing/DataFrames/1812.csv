18,00:01:00.67,00:01:00.67,to be voted for: Stephen and Debbie.
19,00:01:02.38,00:01:02.38,It was preposterous. Erinn and Taj need to be cut
20,00:01:04.50,00:01:04.50,off at the kneecaps. I'm pissed at them for writing

28,00:01:30.21,00:01:30.21,You know what? We're going to run them through
29,00:01:31.71,00:01:31.71,with a sword the next two votes. And I'm thinking Taj has to go
30,00:01:34.42,00:01:34.42,next. >> You got to let it go or it's
31,00:01:36.21,00:01:36.21,going to drive you nuts. >> What a bunch of freaking
32,00:01:37.96,00:01:37.96,cowards. I'm so pissed at them.

39,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,dialogue as to why. It gets so old.
40,00:02:00.25,00:02:00.25,He called me over to talk. He's really upset.
41,00:02:02.58,00:02:02.58,"I said, ""I know, but it's over."" You know?"
42,00:02:11.25,00:02:11.25,>> I don't care about the million dollars.
43,00:02:14.71,00:02:14.71,I care about my integrity and honesty and changing this game

51,00:02:55.96,00:02:55.96,be attached to Coach. He's a downer.

64,00:03:45.17,00:03:45.17,cannon than I thought. Debbie may be up to some no good
65,00:03:48.08,00:03:48.08,around here. I'm so sick of Debbie.
66,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,>> I'm starting to really dislike her.

84,00:04:42.62,00:04:42.62,"player, and I think people don't give her enough credit because"
85,00:04:45.96,00:04:45.96,"she is sweet and because she is chattery, but she has definitely"
86,00:04:49.04,00:04:49.04,"got a lot going on underneath that persona, and she worries me"

191,00:10:17.62,00:10:17.62,"there, might have been a little hard to hear."
192,00:10:20.71,00:10:20.71,There's one... >> See you back at the camp!
193,00:10:22.83,00:10:22.83,"Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God."
194,00:10:27.33,00:10:27.33,>> What?! >> PROBST: Just dawned on her.
195,00:10:30.83,00:10:30.83,">> Oh, my God! Thank you so much!"
196,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,Thank you! >> That's wonderful.
197,00:10:39.42,00:10:39.42,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God!"
198,00:10:42.12,00:10:42.12,"Can we go now? >> PROBST: Taj, come on back up"
199,00:10:44.12,00:10:44.12,here. I'll tell you how it's going to
200,00:10:46.12,00:10:46.12,work. So the last thing Eddie said on
201,00:10:48.71,00:10:48.71,"this tape was, ""I'll see you back at camp."""
202,00:10:52.21,00:10:52.21,Which means just what you think it does.
203,00:10:55.04,00:10:55.04,The bad news is he's the only loved one that's coming back to
204,00:10:59.08,00:10:59.08,"camp, but everyone can have a loved one back at camp if"
205,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,you're willing to make a sacrifice.
206,00:11:05.29,00:11:05.29,"If instead of taking Eddie back to camp, you will instead send"
207,00:11:10.04,00:11:10.04,"yourself to Exile Island, where Eddie will come with you..."
208,00:11:14.08,00:11:14.08,>> Oh! Oh! >> PROBST: Then everybody else
209,00:11:16.88,00:11:16.88,gets a loved one back at camp. >> I'll do it!
210,00:11:18.75,00:11:18.75,"I'll do it! >> Yeah, baby!"
211,00:11:21.21,00:11:21.21,">> I'll do it. >> Okay, can we go now?"
212,00:11:29.71,00:11:29.71,>> A romantic night in the dunes.
213,00:11:31.33,00:11:31.33,Are you crazy? >> Exactly.
214,00:11:33.08,00:11:33.08,>> PROBST: Here's a map. Not that you need it.
215,00:11:35.50,00:11:35.50,>> Where do I go? >> PROBST: Right up this way.
216,00:11:37.29,00:11:37.29,">> Bye, guys. Have fun."
217,00:11:38.88,00:11:38.88,">> Have fun, Taj. >> Thank you, Taj!"
218,00:11:41.12,00:11:41.12,>> PROBST: Taj will return back into the game in time for the
219,00:11:43.29,00:11:43.29,next immunity challenge. I know you guys are ready to
220,00:11:46.17,00:11:46.17,get back to camp. Grab your stuff.
221,00:11:47.96,00:11:47.96,Get out of here. Have a good afternoon.
222,00:11:49.46,00:11:49.46,">> Thanks, Jeff! (screaming)"
223,00:12:12.71,00:12:12.71,"(laughing) >> Oh, missing you, babe!"
224,00:12:20.79,00:12:20.79,"Missing you! >> Oh, baby!"
225,00:12:29.04,00:12:29.04,">> Golly, you look bad. (laughing)"
226,00:12:33.25,00:12:33.25,">> I do. Look at that. >> Oh, my God."
227,00:12:35.21,00:12:35.21,>> I've been wearing this dress for a month.
228,00:12:37.04,00:12:37.04,My husband jumps out from behind a tree and he just
229,00:12:40.04,00:12:40.04,looked like an angel. He just looked like a big old
230,00:12:43.88,00:12:43.88,muscle-bound... I just wanted to take him to the side to have a
231,00:12:46.25,00:12:46.25,"conjugal visit. >> Oh, my God."
232,00:12:48.71,00:12:48.71,>> Look at my back. Look at me legs.
233,00:12:50.21,00:12:50.21,They've been killing me. I'm like the bugs' favorite
234,00:12:52.17,00:12:52.17,"treat out here. >> Golly, you've lost so much"
235,00:12:54.92,00:12:54.92,weight! >> I don't eat.
236,00:12:57.21,00:12:57.21,">> She looks great. I mean, she looks... she looks"
237,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,"happy, you know. She doesn't look withered or"
238,00:13:03.46,00:13:03.46,worn down. She's dirty now.
239,00:13:06.33,00:13:06.33,"She smells filthy, you know, but there's something about the"
240,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,"wild, you know, that make you sexy, you know."
241,00:13:13.00,00:13:13.00,"It's kind of a turn-on, you know?"
242,00:13:15.33,00:13:15.33,"This is all right. >> Funky D, what's up?!"
243,00:13:28.12,00:13:28.12,">> Oh, my God. There's my daughter."
244,00:13:31.96,00:13:31.96,"There's my baby. >> Oh, my God, I am so happy to"
245,00:13:36.25,00:13:36.25,see you! >> Awesome!
246,00:13:39.21,00:13:39.21,">> Oh! >> Oh, my God!"
247,00:13:46.25,00:13:46.25,I don't want you to have to see. >> I was crying.
248,00:13:50.83,00:13:50.83,>> Like my home? >> I am so gross.
249,00:13:56.08,00:13:56.08,You're going to need to disinfect yourself.
250,00:13:58.46,00:13:58.46,>> As soon as I saw my brother standing there with his hand
251,00:14:02.08,00:14:02.08,"over his mouth. >> Oh, my God!"
252,00:14:03.71,00:14:03.71,>> It was just like shock at seeing me.
253,00:14:05.08,00:14:05.08,">> Oh, my God! >> I just, like, gave him a big"
254,00:14:08.25,00:14:08.25,hug. I mean it was maybe one of the
255,00:14:11.79,00:14:11.79,"like most just biggest, sincerest, like, warmest hug"
256,00:14:14.71,00:14:14.71,"we've ever shared, like, if not the most."
257,00:14:17.25,00:14:17.25,>> What do you think of this place?
258,00:14:19.12,00:14:19.12,Can you believe I've lived here 31 days?
259,00:14:21.50,00:14:21.50,>> I cannot say. It's... No.
260,00:14:25.33,00:14:25.33,">> Pretty river, isn't it? >> Yeah."
261,00:14:28.21,00:14:28.21,">> When I saw Adrianna, she was crying."
262,00:14:32.08,00:14:32.08,"It was real huge. I mean, it was like, I didn't"
263,00:14:34.04,00:14:34.04,care about nothing. I just had to get with my
264,00:14:35.92,00:14:35.92,"little sister, you know. Put it on."
265,00:14:37.12,00:14:37.12,I want to see it. >> All right.
266,00:14:38.75,00:14:38.75,>> That looks nice on you. >> You look great.
267,00:14:41.12,00:14:41.12,You look healthy. You look thin.
268,00:14:43.04,00:14:43.04,>> Don't eat me! >> I sleep right here.
269,00:14:46.88,00:14:46.88,Those are my pants. Here's my stuff.
270,00:14:50.50,00:14:50.50,My dad was proud of me just for coming out here.
271,00:14:54.54,00:14:54.54,>> Now you know that's all you need.
272,00:14:56.17,00:14:56.17,">> Yeah. He was like, ""Wait a minute."
273,00:14:58.17,00:14:58.17,"You're doing this. What the hell?"""
274,00:15:02.04,00:15:02.04,"Like, I'm always dressed up. I'm always super girly and,"
275,00:15:04.50,00:15:04.50,"like, I think for him to see me outside of that was a"
276,00:15:07.50,00:15:07.50,"little bit shocking to him. >> Hey, man, guess what they"
277,00:15:09.71,00:15:09.71,call me in this game? Dragonslayer because I'm
278,00:15:12.83,00:15:12.83,"slaying all the dragons. I'm running this freaking show,"
279,00:15:15.21,00:15:15.21,let me tell you that right now. I think I'll be in the final
280,00:15:18.04,00:15:18.04,two. >> I hope so.
281,00:15:19.17,00:15:19.17,>> Unless something crazy comes up.
282,00:15:22.17,00:15:22.17,If you were to say you could have filet mignon or you can see
283,00:15:24.29,00:15:24.29,"your assistant coach for ten minutes, I would say I want to"
284,00:15:26.46,00:15:26.46,see my assistant coach. (back cracking)
285,00:15:32.12,00:15:32.12,"Ah. Yeah, that's what I'm talking"
286,00:15:36.67,00:15:36.67,"about. Get this, too."
287,00:15:42.12,00:15:42.12,"Yeah, no, push, forward, more. We are not doing weird sexual"
288,00:15:48.04,00:15:48.04,"positions, by the way. It's just I haven't had my back"
289,00:15:51.33,00:15:51.33,cracked. >> What is that?
290,00:15:56.42,00:15:56.42,>> Corongutoba. You can make tortillas out of
291,00:15:59.08,00:15:59.08,it. >> You can?
292,00:16:00.46,00:16:00.46,"Mm-hmm. Here, try it. >> Suck on the pit for a while."
293,00:16:04.25,00:16:04.25,"Don't break your teeth. >> Smells like dirty feet, kind"
294,00:16:06.54,00:16:06.54,of. >> That's my favorite snack
295,00:16:09.38,00:16:09.38,we got. >> You don't have to finish it.
296,00:16:12.71,00:16:12.71,I know. I know.
297,00:16:15.12,00:16:15.12,We love it. >> Mm.
298,00:16:21.38,00:16:21.38,>> And another thing you have to be careful of out here is
299,00:16:23.79,00:16:23.79,like the scorpions and stuff like to hide under the branches
300,00:16:26.08,00:16:26.08,so you be careful where you grab it.
301,00:16:28.54,00:16:28.54,">> Scorpions, huh? >> Yeah."
302,00:16:30.42,00:16:30.42,>> Underneath where? >> They're more afraid of you
303,00:16:32.62,00:16:32.62,than you of them. >> I don't want to find out.
304,00:16:35.38,00:16:35.38,"You know what, I played ball. I played against great Steeler"
305,00:16:39.12,00:16:39.12,"defenses; I played against great players like Ray Lewis,"
306,00:16:42.29,00:16:42.29,"but, oh, snakes, scorpions, spiders... I'm like, ""What?!"
307,00:16:47.38,00:16:47.38,"You live with... these are your friends now?"""
308,00:16:54.25,00:16:54.25,>> Look at you! That's my man!
309,00:16:56.62,00:16:56.62,Okay. Let's get some on there.
310,00:16:58.79,00:16:58.79,Keep it going. >> I have a newfound respect
311,00:17:01.12,00:17:01.12,"for her doing this for 31 days, and not any help and standing"
312,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,strong. I know plenty of women that
313,00:17:08.88,00:17:08.88,wouldn't even think about coming out here and enduring
314,00:17:11.75,00:17:11.75,"this. So, you know, she gets all of"
315,00:17:14.38,00:17:14.38,my love for this one. She's the best.
316,00:17:17.17,00:17:17.17,>> I'll be home soon. >> This is your half...
317,00:17:20.17,00:17:20.17,not halftime. This is the fourth-quarter prep.
318,00:17:25.04,00:17:25.04,">> Seeing my husband just, just... it really helped me."
319,00:17:27.92,00:17:27.92,He is my fire. He is the love of my life.
320,00:17:30.75,00:17:30.75,So it was just like the skies just parted; the sun came out.
321,00:17:34.12,00:17:34.12,I just... and nothing else hurt after that.
322,00:17:40.96,00:17:40.96,">> You're doing great, man. You're doing amazingly."
323,00:17:44.17,00:17:44.17,>> It's okay. >> Huh?
324,00:17:46.50,00:17:46.50,>> I just hate breaking down. >> Why?
325,00:17:48.25,00:17:48.25,">> You know, it's like you're not... you don't think about"
326,00:17:50.58,00:17:50.58,"these things, but when I'm out here I don't think about that..."
327,00:17:53.67,00:17:53.67,I try not to think about the people I'm missing at home.
328,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,>> They're good. She told me to tell you that she
329,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,loves you. And wants to know when you're
330,00:18:03.58,00:18:03.58,getting back. >> I never thought I'd miss you
331,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,and Mom and Jamie so much. >> Wishing you could be with
332,00:18:09.25,00:18:09.25,"the cows. >> I know, me, too."
333,00:18:14.21,00:18:14.21,>> And I'm so glad I did it because it's changed...
334,00:18:17.75,00:18:17.75,"it's changed me to be a better person, to not take things for"
335,00:18:21.17,00:18:21.17,granted. Look at my hands.
336,00:18:25.46,00:18:25.46,>> It's okay. That will all fix.
337,00:18:28.25,00:18:28.25,That will all fix. >> Today has been the most
338,00:18:32.04,00:18:32.04,emotional day for my husband and I.
339,00:18:34.71,00:18:34.71,It just showed how really intense our love is for each
340,00:18:37.96,00:18:37.96,other. It meant the world to me that
341,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,my husband came out here to support me.
342,00:18:45.62,00:18:45.62,"I didn't want him to go, though. >> Very cool thing, like, I've"
343,00:18:49.04,00:18:49.04,definitely changed a lot. I'm a total badass.
344,00:18:53.08,00:18:53.08,That's all I have to say about that.
345,00:18:55.50,00:18:55.50,"Now when I go home, like, there's somebody that I don't"
346,00:18:58.62,00:18:58.62,have to explain this to. And to have somebody here that
347,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,"you can just tell everything to, and know that he wouldn't"
348,00:19:04.62,00:19:04.62,use anything against you. Somebody who loves you no
349,00:19:08.58,00:19:08.58,matter what. Somebody's who's worried about
350,00:19:10.25,00:19:10.25,"you, somebody who's concerned about you, was a really great"
351,00:19:12.88,00:19:12.88,thing. Out here you kind of forget
352,00:19:15.33,00:19:15.33,"what that feels like, and it's really nice."
353,00:19:19.25,00:19:19.25,">> It's good to meet you, Dave. >> Good to meet you, J.T.,"
354,00:19:21.00,00:19:21.00,and good luck to you. >> Absolutely.
355,00:19:22.79,00:19:22.79,>> Hey. You've got a good woman.
356,00:19:25.33,00:19:25.33,She cares a lot about you. >> Thanks.
357,00:19:27.21,00:19:27.21,>> She does. I mean that.
358,00:19:29.38,00:19:29.38,>> I'm so glad everybody was here.
359,00:19:32.12,00:19:32.12,">> I don't want you all to go. >> I know, I know."
360,00:19:34.88,00:19:34.88,">> Okay, bye. >> Good to meet you, Coach."
361,00:19:39.00,00:19:39.00,">> You, too. >> Good luck to you."
362,00:19:40.04,00:19:40.04,>> Thank you. >> Please don't tell Mom how
363,00:19:41.88,00:19:41.88,"skinny I am. Oh, I had a tough time saying"
364,00:19:47.17,00:19:47.17,"good-bye. It was really, really hard"
365,00:19:50.92,00:19:50.92,"to let go of him. All I can see is my dad, and I"
366,00:19:53.33,00:19:53.33,"just want to be there, and I want to hang out with him,"
367,00:19:55.71,00:19:55.71,and it was awesome. >> I love you.
368,00:19:59.08,00:19:59.08,">> I love you, too. >> Oh!"
369,00:20:01.29,00:20:01.29,I can't wait to come home. >> I'm so proud of you.
370,00:20:05.29,00:20:05.29,">> Thank you. >> You're the best, you know"
371,00:20:07.33,00:20:07.33,that? >> Yes.
372,00:20:08.79,00:20:08.79,(laughter) >> I love you.
373,00:20:12.92,00:20:12.92,>> I love you more. I won't smell like this for
374,00:20:16.25,00:20:16.25,long. >> I know.
375,00:20:18.04,00:20:18.04,That's okay. I love you.
376,00:20:20.96,00:20:20.96,>> I love you! >> Don't let the bedbugs bite!
377,00:20:25.54,00:20:25.54,>> Too late! >> Cool today.
378,00:20:39.08,00:20:39.08,>> Uh-huh. >> Kind of cool this morning.
379,00:20:42.08,00:20:42.08,">> Yeah, it is. Day 32."
380,00:20:45.25,00:20:45.25,Can't believe that. >> So when he's on a walk
381,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,"today, let's try to figure out how we can get out because I"
382,00:20:53.54,00:20:53.54,"came up with some other ideas, too."
383,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,>> Okay. >> Things we need to think of
384,00:20:57.12,00:20:57.12,"down the line. >> Right, okay."
385,00:21:00.12,00:21:00.12,Debbie's opened up like white on rice in the past few days.
386,00:21:03.21,00:21:03.21,And that leads me to believe that she's turning her game face
387,00:21:07.46,00:21:07.46,on. She's throwing Coach under the
388,00:21:09.58,00:21:09.58,"bus right now, and they've been tight since day one."
389,00:21:13.96,00:21:13.96,You gotta watch out for people like that.
390,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,>> ...Good to always be talking strategy and stuff.
391,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,">> Yeah. >> Um, I really think Taj needs"
392,00:21:22.58,00:21:22.58,"to go. I have this gut feeling, I keep"
393,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,"thinking that if she plays the immunity idol, then one of us"
394,00:21:30.58,00:21:30.58,could go home. You see what I'm saying?
395,00:21:33.21,00:21:33.21,"I'm not trying to get paranoid, but I just don't want any wild"
396,00:21:35.62,00:21:35.62,"cards sneaking up on us, you know what I'm saying?"
397,00:21:38.08,00:21:38.08,Does that sound like a plan? >> That sounds like a plan.
398,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,">> All right, I'm not trying to push, uh, Taj down your throat."
399,00:21:44.71,00:21:44.71,I want you to feel comfortable about that.
400,00:21:46.33,00:21:46.33,">> No, I understand completely. >> I just have a feeling about"
401,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,"it, man. >> Yeah, we'll do that."
402,00:21:49.67,00:21:49.67,We'll talk with Stephen today. We can't let Taj in our ear
403,00:21:52.08,00:21:52.08,anymore. >> Uh-uh.
404,00:21:55.12,00:21:55.12,>> I'm going to go get some more wood.
405,00:21:59.58,00:21:59.58,>> Coach's strategy's not the same as mine at this point in
406,00:22:01.88,00:22:01.88,the game. I feel like I'm really like a
407,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,few steps ahead of Coach when it comes to strategy.
408,00:22:06.75,00:22:06.75,I tell him what he wants to hear at this point to make it
409,00:22:09.46,00:22:09.46,"look like I'm on the same page he's on, when in turn, you know,"
410,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,we're not really on the same page right now.
411,00:22:22.88,00:22:22.88,">> I just feel like, you know, exactly, like I said..."
412,00:22:26.79,00:22:26.79,">> Okay, wait. Do you agree, Erinn?"
413,00:22:28.71,00:22:28.71,">> Yeah. Yeah, I agree."
414,00:22:31.62,00:22:31.62,">> Um, he definitely don't do nothing around camp."
415,00:22:35.33,00:22:35.33,">> And also, I think I'm just ready to see him go."
416,00:22:39.12,00:22:39.12,>> Yeah. >> It's going to have to be
417,00:22:40.71,00:22:40.71,"like we did, like y'all did with Tyson."
418,00:22:42.38,00:22:42.38,It's got to be a blindside. >> Right.
419,00:22:44.08,00:22:44.08,>> Sure. >> But it has to be every
420,00:22:45.71,00:22:45.71,single one of us writing it down.
421,00:22:47.29,00:22:47.29,>> Yeah. >> He's going to be furious
422,00:22:50.08,00:22:50.08,or devastated more. But he's going to feel mostly
423,00:22:52.96,00:22:52.96,"betrayed by me. Talk is, and this is going to"
424,00:22:56.46,00:22:56.46,break his heart and he's going to feel like I have definitely
425,00:22:58.79,00:22:58.79,"betrayed him, but the talk is for Coach to be the next one to"
426,00:23:01.67,00:23:01.67,"go. So, he's going to think we're"
427,00:23:03.92,00:23:03.92,voting off Taj. >> Yep.
428,00:23:05.83,00:23:05.83,>> That's who Coach will think we're voting for.
429,00:23:07.25,00:23:07.25,>> Exactly. >> Okay.
430,00:23:08.83,00:23:08.83,>> He's pretty much driving everybody crazy in the camp
431,00:23:10.83,00:23:10.83,"right now, including me at times."
432,00:23:13.17,00:23:13.17,"Coach thinks he's in an alliance with myself, J.T., and"
433,00:23:16.17,00:23:16.17,Stephen. But J.T. and Stephen have had it
434,00:23:18.17,00:23:18.17,"as well. >> At least in the next vote,"
435,00:23:22.50,00:23:22.50,we gotta be secure in what we do.
436,00:23:24.33,00:23:24.33,">> Okay, I think we need to go ahead and kick Coach out 'cause"
437,00:23:26.54,00:23:26.54,"he's driving everybody insane. Honestly, you are two of the"
438,00:23:34.33,00:23:34.33,people that I care most about in this whole thing and I will
439,00:23:37.42,00:23:37.42,do anything in my power for you two to be sitting there at the 
440,00:23:39.88,00:23:39.88,very end. I swear to you.
441,00:23:41.88,00:23:41.88,"I swear to God I will. And honestly, I'll even do this"
442,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,"for y'all. If I have the immunity idol,"
443,00:23:50.58,00:23:50.58,"and it's down to us three, I will give it to one of you"
444,00:23:54.46,00:23:54.46,so I can be voted out. >> Wow.
445,00:23:57.12,00:23:57.12,>> And I mean that. I'm happy with third.
446,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,"Swear to God. I would hand it to you, J.T."
447,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17,">> That's awesome, Debbie. You're an incredible person."
448,00:24:06.96,00:24:06.96,">> I would do it. I swear to you, I'd do it."
449,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,>> You cannot really trust anybody's promises out here.
450,00:24:15.29,00:24:15.29,I don't know Debbie that well. I've known her for ten days.
451,00:24:18.21,00:24:18.21,I don't know her personal relationship with God or what
452,00:24:21.00,00:24:21.00,"her swears to God mean, but, you know, it's a very lucrative"
453,00:24:24.29,00:24:24.29,offer. A lock for sure on the final
454,00:24:27.21,00:24:27.21,two. >> She just told Stephen and
455,00:24:33.04,00:24:33.04,myself that she would do anything to see me and him
456,00:24:35.29,00:24:35.29,in the final two. Those were her exact words.
457,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,">> Okay, she's out. >> With Debbie making that"
458,00:24:41.25,00:24:41.25,"promise to Stephen and myself, it also makes me wonder what"
459,00:24:44.62,00:24:44.62,"other promises she's made to other people, uh, because she"
460,00:24:47.75,00:24:47.75,shows she's willing to do whatever it takes to move
461,00:24:50.12,00:24:50.12,"forward in this game, even if she says she only wants third"
462,00:24:53.00,00:24:53.00,place. Nobody wants third place in this
463,00:24:54.79,00:24:54.79,game. >> Did she tell Taj the same
464,00:24:56.71,00:24:56.71,"thing? >> Yep, yep."
465,00:24:59.96,00:24:59.96,"She goes. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
466,00:25:17.04,00:25:17.04,We'll now bring in Taj returning from Exile Island.
467,00:25:21.08,00:25:21.08,">> Come on, Taj! >> Hey!"
468,00:25:28.92,00:25:28.92,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
469,00:25:31.67,00:25:31.67,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: First things first,"
470,00:25:33.33,00:25:33.33,"Coach. Once again, immunity is back up"
471,00:25:40.54,00:25:40.54,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you're"
472,00:25:43.54,00:25:43.54,going to make your way through a series of obstacles.
473,00:25:46.21,00:25:46.21,You'll dig your way under a log. You'll go across a balance
474,00:25:48.75,00:25:48.75,"beam, then under a rope crawl and out into a field where you"
475,00:25:53.12,00:25:53.12,will find ten spinning math symbols.
476,00:25:56.21,00:25:56.21,"You'll memorize the sequence of symbols, then race back to your"
477,00:25:58.83,00:25:58.83,answer board and write them down in the same sequence to
478,00:26:02.46,00:26:02.46,solve a math equation. First person to get all the
479,00:26:05.75,00:26:05.75,symbols right and the correct answer to the equation wins
480,00:26:09.50,00:26:09.50,immunity and is guaranteed a one-in-...
481,00:26:13.25,00:26:13.25,>> ALL: Five. >> PROBST: Five shot at winning
482,00:26:17.17,00:26:17.17,the million bucks. >> Wow.
483,00:26:20.50,00:26:20.50,>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.
484,00:26:27.08,00:26:27.08,"Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready?"
485,00:26:31.12,00:26:31.12,Go! First stage is dig a big hole.
486,00:26:38.83,00:26:38.83,"So you can crawl under. Lost a lot of weight out here,"
487,00:26:43.12,00:26:43.12,but you still want to make sure you can get your butt through
488,00:26:46.12,00:26:46.12,that hole. J.T. gonna give it a shot.
489,00:26:53.12,00:26:53.12,J.T. is stuck. J.T. is halfway through.
490,00:26:57.67,00:26:57.67,Taj giving it a shot. Taj is stuck.
491,00:27:03.92,00:27:03.92,J.T. is through! J.T. moving through to the
492,00:27:11.71,00:27:11.71,crawl-through. J.T. having a big lead right
493,00:27:16.96,00:27:16.96,now. Memorize as many of those
494,00:27:19.21,00:27:19.21,symbols as you can in one shot. Debbie's through the
495,00:27:26.83,00:27:26.83,crawl-through. (mumbling)
496,00:27:30.50,00:27:30.50,"Plus, plus. >> PROBST: Stephen gonna have to"
497,00:27:35.08,00:27:35.08,dig a lot more to squeeze through.
498,00:27:39.79,00:27:39.79,J.T. across the beam. Gotta get back through that
499,00:27:42.25,00:27:42.25,hole now before he can start working on the answer.
500,00:27:45.12,00:27:45.12,Coach is now through. He's heading out.
501,00:27:49.33,00:27:49.33,J.T. starting to work on his answer.
502,00:27:53.29,00:27:53.29,Taj is through now. Stephen squeaks through.
503,00:28:04.29,00:28:04.29,Stephen falls off. J.T. heading out to try and
504,00:28:07.08,00:28:07.08,remember some more symbols. Stephen falls off again.
505,00:28:15.88,00:28:15.88,Debbie back. J.T.'s across again.
506,00:28:20.08,00:28:20.08,Stephen cannot get across the balance beam.
507,00:28:23.21,00:28:23.21,He's quickly falling out of this challenge.
508,00:28:28.50,00:28:28.50,Taj taking a look at the symbols.
509,00:28:30.83,00:28:30.83,J.T. racing back. Coach heading back.
510,00:28:34.46,00:28:34.46,Erinn is finally through! Stephen finally across the
511,00:28:37.67,00:28:37.67,"balance beam, but way behind. Debbie heading back."
512,00:28:43.54,00:28:43.54,"J.T. back from his second trip, filling in the last of the"
513,00:28:47.17,00:28:47.17,symbols. J.T. working on the math portion
514,00:28:50.92,00:28:50.92,of this. The symbols have to be right in
515,00:28:54.29,00:28:54.29,order for the math to be right. Coach back with his first set
516,00:29:07.04,00:29:07.04,of symbols. Stephen heading back after
517,00:29:09.42,00:29:09.42,being out there a long time. Debbie back from her second
518,00:29:15.17,00:29:15.17,trip. Taj back from her first trip.
519,00:29:19.75,00:29:19.75,Coach going to head out looking for more symbols.
520,00:29:23.96,00:29:23.96,Debbie working on the math. J.T. doing the math.
521,00:29:28.83,00:29:28.83,Stephen back with his first set of symbols.
522,00:29:31.38,00:29:31.38,He was out there a long time. How many can his brain hold?
523,00:29:41.04,00:29:41.04,Taj heading back out. With only one look at the
524,00:29:45.17,00:29:45.17,"symbols, Stephen's doing all of this on one pass."
525,00:29:49.12,00:29:49.12,"Is he right? >> So, two minus..."
526,00:29:57.04,00:29:57.04,>> PROBST: It's J.T. and Stephen neck and neck.
527,00:30:09.67,00:30:09.67,">> Jeff, is that right? >> PROBST: Stephen thinks he has"
528,00:30:12.42,00:30:12.42,it. >> I got it.
529,00:30:14.17,00:30:14.17,">> PROBST: If he did it, he did it with only one look at the"
530,00:30:16.21,00:30:16.21,symbols. Stephen is right!
531,00:30:21.54,00:30:21.54,"Stephen wins immunity! >> Oh, my God!"
532,00:30:24.21,00:30:24.21,I won immunity! I can't even believe it!
533,00:30:27.62,00:30:27.62,"(cheering) >> PROBST: Stephen, I gotta ask"
534,00:30:34.29,00:30:34.29,you. You memorized all ten symbols in
535,00:30:37.04,00:30:37.04,"one pass. >> Well, I divided... I made"
536,00:30:40.04,00:30:40.04,"each symbol be a number so I had plus is one, divided by is"
537,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,"four, times is three. And I know the brain can"
538,00:30:46.04,00:30:46.04,remember a seven-digit number 'cause that's why phone numbers
539,00:30:48.54,00:30:48.54,"are seven digits. So, I divided it into two"
540,00:30:51.04,00:30:51.04,"numbers, um, and just remembered those two numbers."
541,00:30:54.71,00:30:54.71,">> PROBST: Well, it worked. Come on over."
542,00:30:56.67,00:30:56.67,">> All right, Stephen! >> PROBST: That was one of the"
543,00:30:59.12,00:30:59.12,biggest come-from-behind victories ever.
544,00:31:01.79,00:31:01.79,>> I was pretty much last. >> PROBST: With this around his
545,00:31:03.92,00:31:03.92,"neck, Stephen is safe at tonight's Tribal Council."
546,00:31:06.42,00:31:06.42,"J.T., Debbie, Coach, Taj, Erinn, after 33 days out here, one of"
547,00:31:12.83,00:31:12.83,you going home tonight. Grab your stuff.
548,00:31:15.00,00:31:15.00,Head back to camp. I will see you at Tribal.
549,00:31:16.83,00:31:16.83,"Nice work. >> Thanks a lot, Jeff."
550,00:31:19.33,00:31:19.33,>> I look over at Stephen and I see the necklace around his
551,00:31:21.29,00:31:21.29,"neck, and it was just like I got the necklace."
552,00:31:23.50,00:31:23.50,"You know, every time something goes our way, I try hard not to"
553,00:31:27.88,00:31:27.88,"do it, but I always look at Stephen and smile because he"
554,00:31:30.33,00:31:30.33,knows just like I do we just keep battling it out.
555,00:31:33.12,00:31:33.12,Keep doing what we're doing. We can do this.
556,00:31:49.33,00:31:49.33,">> Good job, Steve-o! >> Thank you."
557,00:31:52.29,00:31:52.29,>> Steve-o. Steve-o!
558,00:31:54.38,00:31:54.38,>> The day I did not think would come.
559,00:31:56.67,00:31:56.67,>> I'm going to go and rinse off.
560,00:31:58.67,00:31:58.67,">> Me, too. >> Yeah."
561,00:31:59.92,00:31:59.92,>> Let me get some of this sand off.
562,00:32:02.50,00:32:02.50,"J.T. and I, we came into this merge basically expecting to be"
563,00:32:06.67,00:32:06.67,picked off. And now we're in the dominant
564,00:32:09.21,00:32:09.21,position. Now the Timbira people are
565,00:32:10.96,00:32:10.96,"individually coming to us and, you know, begging for our mercy."
566,00:32:14.38,00:32:14.38,"So to have done that together with Taj and J.T., to have"
567,00:32:18.04,00:32:18.04,"stuck tight, even when all of these different factions were"
568,00:32:21.29,00:32:21.29,"vying for our attentions, we feel pretty good about it."
569,00:32:26.75,00:32:26.75,>> Debbie thinks Coach... >> Debbie is strategical woman
570,00:32:29.25,00:32:29.25,"of the year. >> Oh, my God."
571,00:32:30.71,00:32:30.71,She's sucking up to everybody. >> She promised us if we'd take
572,00:32:33.50,00:32:33.50,"her to the final three, she would give up immunity and take"
573,00:32:36.71,00:32:36.71,third place. >> Get out.
574,00:32:38.21,00:32:38.21,">> Which we don't believe. >> In the same day, she said"
575,00:32:39.62,00:32:39.62,we've got to get rid of Erinn. >> Get out.
576,00:32:41.88,00:32:41.88,">> So, I said, ""Erinn, when you got nauseous at the end,"
577,00:32:45.12,00:32:45.12,"Debbie just threw you under the bus."""
578,00:32:46.67,00:32:46.67,"She said, ""Coach, then you, and then Taj, of course, next."""
579,00:32:50.04,00:32:50.04,">> Oh, Lord. He's like, ""Are you okay out"
580,00:32:52.92,00:32:52.92,"here?"" I was like, ""I have two brothers"
581,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"that are taking care of me."" >> Taj really trusts Stephen"
582,00:32:58.12,00:32:58.12,"and myself. I mean, we're her only two"
583,00:32:59.50,00:32:59.50,"guys out here. It's good to know, you know,"
584,00:33:02.29,00:33:02.29,"that she's still sticking with us, but no one else in this"
585,00:33:05.25,00:33:05.25,entire tribe knows what's really going on like Stephen and I do.
586,00:33:14.12,00:33:14.12,>> Huh? The more you think about it?
587,00:33:15.08,00:33:15.08,>> The Debbie thing is not a good idea.
588,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,What do you think? The downsides of losing Debbie
589,00:33:20.83,00:33:20.83,are she is a really hard worker around camp.
590,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,She is a very strong positive presence.
591,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,I actually think she would step aside at three and let J.T. and
592,00:33:28.38,00:33:28.38,"me have it. >> Man, that spa was so nice"
593,00:33:30.88,00:33:30.88,right now. >> We went at the wrong time.
594,00:33:32.71,00:33:32.71,We went when it was overcast and gross.
595,00:33:34.46,00:33:34.46,>> Yeah. >> You feeling good?
596,00:33:37.71,00:33:37.71,>> I'm feeling good now. >> My ass.
597,00:33:41.54,00:33:41.54,(laughing) >> Other downsides to losing
598,00:33:46.42,00:33:46.42,Debbie are a couple more days here with Coach.
599,00:33:49.08,00:33:49.08,">> I think about it, and I've got my instincts saying you've"
600,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,"got to get rid of Taj next because if she has the idol,"
601,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,"she's going to play the five. >> We're solid, man, the four"
602,00:33:57.54,00:33:57.54,of us. We don't have nothing to worry
603,00:33:58.92,00:33:58.92,about. The only thing to get in our
604,00:34:00.58,00:34:00.58,"way is the idol. We play this right, that's over"
605,00:34:03.38,00:34:03.38,with. That's done.
606,00:34:06.25,00:34:06.25,"Coach, you know, he's always wanting to reassure that things"
607,00:34:10.62,00:34:10.62,"are going his way, and it's just hard to deal with him."
608,00:34:13.58,00:34:13.58,"I mean, I don't want to lie to him."
609,00:34:17.33,00:34:17.33,">> All the way, fellas. >> Let's do it."
610,00:34:20.54,00:34:20.54,>> Do you guys realize... I'm just going to tell you this
611,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,right now. I'm just going to throw a
612,00:34:24.04,00:34:24.04,reality check on you. One of us three is going to win
613,00:34:27.08,00:34:27.08,"it. >> I hate lying to anybody, so"
614,00:34:28.58,00:34:28.58,"anybody I got to lie to, I try to avoid them."
615,00:34:31.38,00:34:31.38,So the sooner I get the people I've got to lie to out of the
616,00:34:33.29,00:34:33.29,"game, the better. >> Whether or not Debbie is"
617,00:35:09.75,00:35:09.75,"scheming, whether or not Coach is delusional, right now it"
618,00:35:12.58,00:35:12.58,doesn't matter. We need to figure each move
619,00:35:14.58,00:35:14.58,strategically to make things easier for the next move.
620,00:35:18.08,00:35:18.08,We don't need any of them to be loyal right now; as long as we
621,00:35:20.88,00:35:20.88,"have a strong alliance, we can pick them off one by one."
622,00:35:38.25,00:35:38.25,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
623,00:35:43.21,00:35:43.21,"Brendan, Tyson, and Sierra, voted out at the last Tribal"
624,00:35:48.42,00:35:48.42,"Council. Coach, from the beginning of"
625,00:35:54.33,00:35:54.33,"this game, you've talked about going to the end with the best"
626,00:35:57.38,00:35:57.38,players. >> Right.
627,00:35:58.79,00:35:58.79,">> PROBST: With only six people left, everybody can't be"
628,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,"equally deserving. >> I think that, you know, what"
629,00:36:04.54,00:36:04.54,might be considered a strength in my mind might not be a
630,00:36:08.00,00:36:08.00,strength in somebody else's mind.
631,00:36:09.38,00:36:09.38,"Stephen, you know, he's a warrior to me because he has"
632,00:36:12.71,00:36:12.71,gone from a boy who likes to read books about adventure to a
633,00:36:16.54,00:36:16.54,man who is living an adventure and excelling at it without any
634,00:36:19.79,00:36:19.79,complaints. >> PROBST: Let's go a little
635,00:36:21.42,00:36:21.42,further with this. How about Debbie?
636,00:36:23.38,00:36:23.38,Why should she be here at the end and not someone else
637,00:36:26.00,00:36:26.00,sitting up here? >> I'd say that Debbie is
638,00:36:28.08,00:36:28.08,"playing the game for the same reasons that I am, and that is"
639,00:36:30.92,00:36:30.92,for integrity. And so that's why we paired up
640,00:36:33.50,00:36:33.50,"on day three because I know she will never lie to me,"
641,00:36:36.54,00:36:36.54,no matter what. >> PROBST: And because you feel
642,00:36:39.42,00:36:39.42,"that way, that makes her the best to go to the end."
643,00:36:42.04,00:36:42.04,>> I trust her implicitly. She will not lie to me in this
644,00:36:45.04,00:36:45.04,"game. >> PROBST: Taj, how risky is"
645,00:36:47.38,00:36:47.38,"that for Coach to say, ""I paired up with Debbie on day"
646,00:36:51.08,00:36:51.08,"three?"" >> Um, it's not risky."
647,00:36:53.12,00:36:53.12,That's what people do. You build alliances.
648,00:36:54.54,00:36:54.54,"You do what you have to do to survive in the game, and he's"
649,00:36:57.04,00:36:57.04,done a great job. He's a warrior.
650,00:36:58.75,00:36:58.75,He's a dragonslayer. He-He's...
651,00:37:00.79,00:37:00.79,>> PROBST: A warrior. >> That's what he says.
652,00:37:02.58,00:37:02.58,He's a warrior... >> PROBST: That's what you said.
653,00:37:05.42,00:37:05.42,>> Because that's what he calls himself.
654,00:37:07.25,00:37:07.25,">> I didn't come up with that, by the way."
655,00:37:09.08,00:37:09.08,>> PROBST: Let me guess: some chief in a small village...
656,00:37:11.62,00:37:11.62,(laughter) >> That's fine.
657,00:37:15.17,00:37:15.17,"Hey, every time we come in here and you want to try to cut me"
658,00:37:18.46,00:37:18.46,"down because you want to try to ferret out the truth, I love it."
659,00:37:22.88,00:37:22.88,>> PROBST: Okay. Let's take it to the next step.
660,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,Tell me about Taj. What is it that makes her best
661,00:37:28.54,00:37:28.54,to go to the end? >> When I saw the raw emotions
662,00:37:31.71,00:37:31.71,"of her the other day at the auction, you know, she has made"
663,00:37:37.12,00:37:37.12,"the ultimate sacrifice, taking time away from her son that"
664,00:37:40.88,00:37:40.88,"she'll never get back. And so, that is incredible."
665,00:37:44.12,00:37:44.12,">> PROBST: Coach, how hard would it be to vote out Taj"
666,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50,tonight after making that sacrifice so that you guys
667,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,could all get your loved ones? >> I think every time that each
668,00:37:52.08,00:37:52.08,"one of us sit here and analyze each person up here, we all"
669,00:37:55.25,00:37:55.25,"think, ""Is it justifiable?"" And obviously, coming on the"
670,00:37:58.54,00:37:58.54,"heels of her doing something like that, it would be very"
671,00:38:01.08,00:38:01.08,difficult for any of us to want to vote her out tonight.
672,00:38:04.54,00:38:04.54,">> PROBST: Now, let's turn the tables."
673,00:38:06.17,00:38:06.17,"J.T., what makes Coach worthy? He talks about wanting to take"
674,00:38:09.33,00:38:09.33,the best to the end. What if he's not one of the
675,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,best? >> Anyone that will stand here
676,00:38:13.08,00:38:13.08,"and put himself out on the line and be this honest, you know,"
677,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,"has never told a lie, deserves to go as far as his body can"
678,00:38:19.83,00:38:19.83,"stand. >> Debbie, what is working"
679,00:38:22.25,00:38:22.25,against Coach making it to the end?
680,00:38:25.00,00:38:25.00,>> I think Coach is determined to be honest.
681,00:38:27.25,00:38:27.25,"And this is a game that honesty is huge, but can it really last"
682,00:38:32.62,00:38:32.62,through the duration of this game?
683,00:38:34.92,00:38:34.92,I don't know. But if there is an Achilles'
684,00:38:37.04,00:38:37.04,"heel on Coach, that could be it. >> PROBST: Erinn, is tonight's"
685,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,"vote going to surprise somebody? >> Um, there might be surprises"
686,00:38:45.29,00:38:45.29,"tonight. >> PROBST: Debbie, how will"
687,00:38:47.58,00:38:47.58,"tonight's vote change this game? >> Um, that's a really good"
688,00:38:53.46,00:38:53.46,"question, Jeff. I think that it's going to"
689,00:38:56.17,00:38:56.17,change the way this tribe behaves and how we're going to
690,00:38:59.79,00:38:59.79,"figure out who belongs where, and, um, I do think it will be a"
691,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,"surprise. >> PROBST: Stephen, you have"
692,00:39:09.25,00:39:09.25,the individual immunity necklace.
693,00:39:10.71,00:39:10.71,"As always, it's yours to assign to somebody else if you want"
694,00:39:13.21,00:39:13.21,"or keep it for yourself. >> I'm going to hold on to it,"
695,00:39:14.54,00:39:14.54,Jeff. >> PROBST: You cannot vote
696,00:39:15.71,00:39:15.71,for Stephen. Everybody else is fair game.
697,00:39:17.88,00:39:17.88,"It's time to vote. Coach, you're up."
698,00:39:28.88,00:39:28.88,">> Taj, you're a beautiful soul. Best of luck."
699,00:39:55.88,00:39:55.88,">> I'm sorry, Coach, but this game is changing, and you wanted"
700,00:39:58.92,00:39:58.92,"to play it with honesty and integrity, and it's time for you"
701,00:40:01.88,00:40:01.88,to go. Hope you forgive me.
702,00:40:16.08,00:40:16.08,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
703,00:40:28.21,00:40:28.21,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
704,00:40:30.21,00:40:30.21,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
705,00:40:35.75,00:40:35.75,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
706,00:40:39.00,00:40:39.00,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
707,00:40:40.71,00:40:40.71,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
708,00:40:45.75,00:40:45.75,First vote: Taj. Coach.
709,00:40:53.54,00:40:53.54,One vote Taj; one vote Coach. Debbie.
710,00:41:00.79,00:41:00.79,One vote Taj; one vote Coach; one vote Debbie.
711,00:41:08.83,00:41:08.83,Debbie. That's two votes Debbie;
712,00:41:11.25,00:41:11.25,one vote Taj; one vote Coach. 11th person voted out and the
713,00:41:18.21,00:41:18.21,fourth member of our jury: Debbie.
714,00:41:21.17,00:41:21.17,That's three. That's enough.
715,00:41:22.21,00:41:22.21,"You need to bring me your torch. Debbie, the tribe has spoken."
716,00:41:35.08,00:41:35.08,"Time for you to go. Well, there's no doubt the best"
717,00:41:48.29,00:41:48.29,players will make it to the end. The more interesting question:
718,00:41:52.08,00:41:52.08,"of the five of you, who's the best of the best?"
719,00:41:55.75,00:41:55.75,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
