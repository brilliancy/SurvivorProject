2,00:00:01.96,00:00:01.96,">> Jeff: PREVIOUSLY ON ""SURVIVOR"": 20 AMERICANS TREKKED"
3,00:00:05.17,00:00:05.17,"INTO THE WILDS OF NICARAGUA, AN UNTAMED LAND OF ACTIVE VOLCANOS,"
4,00:00:09.46,00:00:09.46,DENSE RAIN FORESTS AND FIERCE WILDLIFE.
5,00:00:12.54,00:00:12.54,">> EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, THERE'S MONKEYS HANGING FROM THINGS."
6,00:00:16.38,00:00:16.38,THERE'S DANGEROUS ANIMALS HERE.
7,00:00:18.62,00:00:18.62,IT'S LIKE-- IT'S REAL.
8,00:00:20.33,00:00:20.33,>> Jeff: THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO TRIBES--
9,00:00:22.04,00:00:22.04,THE YOUNG VERSUS THE OLD.
10,00:00:23.54,00:00:23.54,">> OH, MAN."
11,00:00:25.12,00:00:25.12,I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE CARRYING ME.
12,00:00:29.54,00:00:29.54,>> Jeff: THE OLDER TRIBE IMMEDIATELY FELL UNDER THE SWAY
13,00:00:31.71,00:00:31.71,OF TWO-TIME SUPER BOWL-WINNING COACH JIMMIE JOHNSON.
14,00:00:35.25,00:00:35.25,>> AS LONG AS WE'RE PSYCHED UP FOR IT AND WE KNOW
15,00:00:36.88,00:00:36.88,"WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DO, WE'LL KICK THEIR ASS."
16,00:00:39.50,00:00:39.50,>> I JUST GOT A PEP TALK FROM JIMMIE JOHNSON!
17,00:00:42.42,00:00:42.42,">> Jeff: ON THE YOUNGER TRIBE, SHANNON DECIDED"
18,00:00:44.92,00:00:44.92,THAT HE WAS THE ALPHA MALE
19,00:00:46.38,00:00:46.38,AND IMMEDIATELY FORMED A STRONG MAN ALLIANCE WITH CHASE.
20,00:00:49.88,00:00:49.88,"WITHOUT ME OR YOU, I THINK THEY'RE SCREWED."
21,00:00:51.29,00:00:51.29,BUT CHASE WAS ALSO DRAWN TO BRENDA.
22,00:00:53.08,00:00:53.08,>> SHE'S A CUTE GIRL.
23,00:00:54.25,00:00:54.25,"I MEAN, YEAH, I'M ATTRACTED TO HER."
24,00:00:55.79,00:00:55.79,I FOR SOME REASON REALLY TRUST HER.
25,00:00:57.29,00:00:57.29,>> Jeff: SO HE GOT INTO A SECOND ALLIANCE WITH HER.
26,00:01:00.21,00:01:00.21,">> CHASE, HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY."
27,00:01:02.62,00:01:02.62,BUT HE'S CLUELESS.
28,00:01:03.75,00:01:03.75,">> Jeff: MEANWHILE, ALINA AND KELLY B."
29,00:01:06.17,00:01:06.17,FOUND A CLUE TO A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
30,00:01:08.29,00:01:08.29,>> WE KEEP IT BETWEEN US.
31,00:01:09.62,00:01:09.62,>> Jeff: FINDING THE CLUE WAS A STROKE OF LUCK FOR KELLY B.
32,00:01:13.29,00:01:13.29,BECAUSE HER ARTIFICIAL LEG MADE HER A TARGET.
33,00:01:18.21,00:01:18.21,>> SHE WILL DEFINITELY BEAT UP WITH SYMPATHY VOTE
34,00:01:19.79,00:01:19.79,SO SHE'S DEFINITELY GOT TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO GO.
35,00:01:22.67,00:01:22.67,">> Jeff: AT THE IMMUNITY CHALLENGE, THE OLDER TRIBE"
36,00:01:24.29,00:01:24.29,HELD THE MEDALLION OF POWER WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM
37,00:01:27.21,00:01:27.21,AN ADVANTAGE IN THE COMPETITION.
38,00:01:29.21,00:01:29.21,"IF YOU USE IT, THE MEDALLION GOES TO THE YOUNGER TRIBE"
39,00:01:31.46,00:01:31.46,AND THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
40,00:01:33.38,00:01:33.38,TO USE IT AT THE NEXT CHALLENGE.
41,00:01:35.21,00:01:35.21,>> WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT.
42,00:01:36.17,00:01:36.17,>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO NOT USE IT.
43,00:01:37.38,00:01:37.38,>> DON'T NEED IT.
44,00:01:38.79,00:01:38.79,">> Jeff: UNFORTUNATELY BY NOT PLAYING THE MEDALLION,"
45,00:01:40.38,00:01:40.38,THE OLDER TRIBE MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
46,00:01:42.46,00:01:42.46,YOUNGER TRIBE WINS IMMUNITY!
47,00:01:45.42,00:01:45.42,"BRENDA, WOULD YOU HAVE USED THAT MEDALLION OF POWER"
48,00:01:47.92,00:01:47.92,IN TODAY'S CHALLENGE?
49,00:01:49.33,00:01:49.33,">> DEFINITELY, BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE TO WIN SO WHY TAKE CHANCES?"
50,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,">> Jeff: BACK AT CAMP,"
51,00:01:53.25,00:01:53.25,JIMMIE JOHNSON DECIDED WENDY WAS THE WEAK LINK.
52,00:01:55.96,00:01:55.96,">> YOU ASK YOURSELF, DOES THE TEAM GET STRONGER WITHOUT WENDY?"
53,00:01:58.62,00:01:58.62,>> Jeff: JIMMY'S CHOICE CONCERNED HOLLY
54,00:02:00.54,00:02:00.54,BECAUSE SHE WAS IN AN ALLIANCE WITH WENDY.
55,00:02:02.88,00:02:02.88,>> FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY CAUGHT IN A DILEMMA
56,00:02:05.25,00:02:05.25,BECAUSE I SHOOK HER HAND AND GAVE HER MY WORD.
57,00:02:08.04,00:02:08.04,">> Jeff: BUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, HOLLY TURNED HER BACK"
58,00:02:10.92,00:02:10.92,ON HER ALLY AND SIDED WITH COACH JIMMIE
59,00:02:13.29,00:02:13.29,AND REST OF THE TRIBE TO VOTE OUT WENDY.
60,00:02:16.25,00:02:16.25,"WENDY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
61,00:02:19.38,00:02:19.38,19 ARE LEFT.
62,00:02:20.83,00:02:20.83,WHO WILL BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT?
63,00:02:32.21,00:02:32.21,">> I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF RIGHT NOW ON THE OUTS,"
64,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17,AND I KNOW MY TRIBE SENSES I AM.
65,00:02:37.12,00:02:37.12,"I JUST FELT BAD ABOUT MAKING THE ALLIANCE WITH WENDY AND THEN,"
66,00:02:41.33,00:02:41.33,"OF COURSE, I WENT IN WITH EVERYBODY ELSE TO VOTE HER OUT."
67,00:02:44.33,00:02:44.33,TONIGHT'S DECISION WAS FOR MY TEAM.
68,00:02:46.92,00:02:46.92,>> NO QUESTION.
69,00:02:48.25,00:02:48.25,>> I REALLY LIKED WENDY.
70,00:02:49.83,00:02:49.83,"I KNOW IT'S PART OF THE GAME TO LIE,"
71,00:02:51.38,00:02:51.38,AND THAT'S PART OF THE STRATEGY.
72,00:02:54.08,00:02:54.08,SO I THINK MY NEXT STEP NEEDS TO BE TO RETHINK EVERYTHING.
73,00:02:58.38,00:02:58.38,BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW THESE PEOPLE
74,00:03:00.83,00:03:00.83,"THAT I CAN KICK THEIR ASS ON ""SURVIVOR."""
75,00:04:23.54,00:04:23.54,>> I DON'T THINK I SLEPT A WINK.
76,00:04:24.92,00:04:24.92,>> REALLY.
77,00:04:26.21,00:04:26.21,>> THAT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK.
78,00:04:28.62,00:04:28.62,">> NO, YOU'VE GOT TO GET SOME SLEEP."
79,00:04:31.46,00:04:31.46,>> THE PLAN FOR TODAY IS TO GET
80,00:04:33.33,00:04:33.33,TO A BETTER PLACE WITH REGARDS TO SLEEP.
81,00:04:35.29,00:04:35.29,THE SHELTER'S STILL NOT TOTALLY THERE.
82,00:04:37.50,00:04:37.50,PEOPLE WERE UP ALL NIGHT.
83,00:04:38.58,00:04:38.58,WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT DOWN BETTER.
84,00:04:40.00,00:04:40.00,I HAVEN'T SLEPT AT ALL.
85,00:04:43.42,00:04:43.42,">> WE'VE GOT EVERYBODY HERE,"
86,00:04:44.67,00:04:44.67,MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A GROUP CONVERSATION.
87,00:04:48.92,00:04:48.92,>> LOOK AT REARRANGING THE BAMBOO AND LATCHING IT ALL UP.
88,00:04:52.79,00:04:52.79,AND PUTTING THE BEDDING.
89,00:04:54.33,00:04:54.33,>> THE MORNING MEETING WENT PRETTY GOOD.
90,00:04:55.75,00:04:55.75,IT SEEMS TO BE THIS ROUTINE WE'VE FALLEN INTO.
91,00:04:57.67,00:04:57.67,EVERYONE SIT DOWN AND DECIDE WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THE DAY.
92,00:05:01.25,00:05:01.25,COACH GAVE US OUR ASSIGNMENTS FOR TODAY.
93,00:05:04.88,00:05:04.88,>> YOU'RE GOING TO HANDLE THE BAMBOO.
94,00:05:06.25,00:05:06.25,>> I'LL HELP ON THE ROOF.
95,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,>> JIMMY T. WAS HELPING ME ON THAT.
96,00:05:12.08,00:05:12.08,>> JANE HAS THIS GOOD IDEA OF GOING FISHING.
97,00:05:15.42,00:05:15.42,">> TIME OUT, TIME OUT."
98,00:05:16.67,00:05:16.67,>> LET'S STAY ON TRACK.
99,00:05:18.88,00:05:18.88,"HEY, JIMMY, WE HEAR YOU."
100,00:05:20.71,00:05:20.71,AND THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
101,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,THAT'S-- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
102,00:05:25.75,00:05:25.75,"SO ON THE ROOF, WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?"
103,00:05:27.83,00:05:27.83,">> JIMMY'S THE MAN NOW,"
104,00:05:29.21,00:05:29.21,"AND EVERYBODY IS BUYING IN HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER."
105,00:05:31.50,00:05:31.50,SO NOW HE'S GOING TO HAVE TD DOING THIS
106,00:05:35.96,00:05:35.96,"AND NOBODY IS SAYING ""JIMMY T. WHAT DO YOU THINK?"""
107,00:05:37.96,00:05:37.96,AND IT'S STARTING TO WEAR ON ME.
108,00:05:40.54,00:05:40.54,">> WITH THIS HERE, THE KNOTS ARE GOING TO BE A PROBLEM."
109,00:05:44.25,00:05:44.25,">> YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE TRUE."
110,00:05:49.17,00:05:49.17,>> JIMMY J. IS JUMPING IN
111,00:05:50.67,00:05:50.67,AND TRYING TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE WHOLE TRIBE
112,00:05:51.96,00:05:51.96,AND I SAID LET'S ROLL WITH THAT.
113,00:05:54.58,00:05:54.58,THAT'S FINE.
114,00:05:55.96,00:05:55.96,"FRANKLY, NOW I'M PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON HIM."
115,00:05:59.25,00:05:59.25,I'M NOT PUTTING MY FACE OUT THERE ANYMORE.
116,00:06:00.83,00:06:00.83,YOU'RE THE MAN.
117,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,I THINK I CAN USE THAT TO MY ADVANTAGE
118,00:06:04.29,00:06:04.29,IN THE EVENT WE HAVE TO VOTE SOMEBODY ELSE OFF.
119,00:06:12.29,00:06:12.29,>> I'VE NEVER GONE SO LONG WITHOUT SHOWERING
120,00:06:14.96,00:06:14.96,OR BRUSHING MY TEETH.
121,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,>> I HAVE.
122,00:06:17.71,00:06:17.71,(\\LAUGHTER\\)
123,00:06:20.96,00:06:20.96,>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS TRIBE?
124,00:06:23.12,00:06:23.12,>> I'M REALLY HAPPY.
125,00:06:25.75,00:06:25.75,I KNOW ALL THE GUYS ARE REALLY STRONG.
126,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,I KNOW YOU'RE STRONG.
127,00:06:29.50,00:06:29.50,>> WHY EVERYBODY THINK I'M STRONG?
128,00:06:31.67,00:06:31.67,">> LOOK AT THOSE MUSCLES, GIRL."
129,00:06:33.29,00:06:33.29,>> WHATEVER.
130,00:06:35.25,00:06:35.25,"BUT NOBODY HAS, LIKE, NO GUYS CAME AND TALKED TO ME"
131,00:06:37.46,00:06:37.46,OR APPROACHED ME OR NOTHING.
132,00:06:39.25,00:06:39.25,I LIKE SASH A WHOLE LOT.
133,00:06:41.75,00:06:41.75,HE'S DOWN TO EARTH AND HE HAS THAT MILLION-DOLLAR SMILE.
134,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,"AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A GOOD VIBE, A GOOD CHEMISTRY."
135,00:06:47.75,00:06:47.75,>> I'M HALF BLACK.
136,00:06:49.12,00:06:49.12,MY DAD IS FROM JAMAICA SO I'D LOVE TO BRING AS MANY MINORITIES
137,00:06:52.96,00:06:52.96,"TO THE END AS POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
138,00:06:55.29,00:06:55.29,>> THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD.
139,00:06:56.71,00:06:56.71,I WON'T SHAKE YOUR HAND BUT I'LL WINK AT YOU.
140,00:06:59.62,00:06:59.62,">> WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, WE CAN TRY AND BRING IN BRENDA."
141,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,I THINK SHE'S THE SMARTEST PERSON HERE
142,00:07:05.42,00:07:05.42,"AND I THINK SHE WOULD BE A GOOD ASSET, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?"
143,00:07:08.21,00:07:08.21,"BEING MINORITIES, WE HAVE A BOND THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN SHARE."
144,00:07:11.00,00:07:11.00,"IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS, WE COULD DOMINATE THIS GAME."
145,00:07:15.12,00:07:15.12,NOW IT'S JUST UP TO THE ASIAN SENSATION
146,00:07:17.08,00:07:17.08,"IF SHE'S WILLING TO ALIGN WITH US OR NOT, SO WE'LL HAVE TO SEE."
147,00:07:20.21,00:07:20.21,"I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TRY AND, YOU KNOW,"
148,00:07:22.33,00:07:22.33,MAKE FRIENDS WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.
149,00:07:23.92,00:07:23.92,>> EXACTLY.
150,00:07:25.08,00:07:25.08,">> BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL A NUMBERS GAME."
151,00:07:26.83,00:07:26.83,>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT KELLY B.?
152,00:07:28.75,00:07:28.75,>> KELLY B. IS A BIG THREAT
153,00:07:30.25,00:07:30.25,"BECAUSE IF SHE CAN MAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE END,"
154,00:07:31.42,00:07:31.42,IT'S A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT.
155,00:07:32.42,00:07:32.42,>> RIGHT.
156,00:07:33.83,00:07:33.83,I'VE ALREADY TOLD MYSELF IF THERE'S A CHALLENGE
157,00:07:35.50,00:07:35.50,"WHERE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO, LIKE, RACE,"
158,00:07:38.08,00:07:38.08,"AND THAT LEG FALLS OFF, SHE'S OUT OF HERE."
159,00:07:41.88,00:07:41.88,FOR REAL.
160,00:07:43.25,00:07:43.25,"KELLY B., SHE'S A CHARITY CASE."
161,00:07:45.67,00:07:45.67,"SHE HAS THE HEART, SHE HAS THE MIND,"
162,00:07:47.75,00:07:47.75,BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE 100% OF THE BODY
163,00:07:49.42,00:07:49.42,AND THAT'S GOING TO HURT US.
164,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,"TODAY, I SAW JILL EATING SNAILS,"
165,00:08:07.12,00:08:07.12,AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU COULD EAT THEM OR NOT.
166,00:08:10.12,00:08:10.12,SHE WAS GOING LIKE THIS...
167,00:08:13.46,00:08:13.46,"AND ROLLING HER EYES, AND THEN THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED"
168,00:08:16.58,00:08:16.58,"WHEN JILL ACTED THAT WAY, THAT YOU REALLY COULDN'T EAT THEM."
169,00:08:19.46,00:08:19.46,>> YOU GOTTA TRY THESE.
170,00:08:20.92,00:08:20.92,">> THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I'LL PASS."
171,00:08:23.08,00:08:23.08,IT'S A BAD IDEA.
172,00:08:24.08,00:08:24.08,>> NO.
173,00:08:25.25,00:08:25.25,">> I'LL ADMIT IT, IT'S A BAD IDEA."
174,00:08:26.83,00:08:26.83,YOU HONESTLY THINK YOU CAN EAT THESE THINGS?
175,00:08:29.21,00:08:29.21,YOU GUYS ARE STUPID.
176,00:08:31.00,00:08:31.00,>> ARE YOU LOSING IT?
177,00:08:32.00,00:08:32.00,ARE YOU HAVING A MELTDOWN?
178,00:08:33.00,00:08:33.00,>> WHY IS SHE GETTING ALL MAD?
179,00:08:34.17,00:08:34.17,>> I DON'T KNOW.
180,00:08:36.04,00:08:36.04,>> HOLLY IS A VERY NICE PERSON BUT SHE'S OFF THE DEEP END.
181,00:08:40.21,00:08:40.21,SHE NEEDS TO DO WELL IN THIS GAME AND SHE'S NOT
182,00:08:42.96,00:08:42.96,AND NOW SHE'S HITTING THE PANIC BUTTON.
183,00:08:46.75,00:08:46.75,>> THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SNAILS
184,00:08:48.33,00:08:48.33,SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF HOLLY.
185,00:08:51.12,00:08:51.12,"HER MENTAL STATE IS NOT GOOD, AND IN ""SURVIVOR"""
186,00:08:53.50,00:08:53.50,YOU DON'T WANT TO COME ACROSS AS MENTALLY UNSTABLE.
187,00:08:56.21,00:08:56.21,"ALL OF A SUDDEN HOLLY GRABBED THE POT AND, LIKE,"
188,00:08:58.67,00:08:58.67,"TOOK OFF, AND SHE DUMPED THEM."
189,00:09:00.50,00:09:00.50,>> WOW.
190,00:09:02.42,00:09:02.42,"THROWING AWAY FOOD, THAT'S--"
191,00:09:03.42,00:09:03.42,>> AND THEY WERE HUGE.
192,00:09:04.42,00:09:04.42,AND THEY WERE GOOD PROTEIN.
193,00:09:05.42,00:09:05.42,>> THAT'S CRAZY.
194,00:09:06.83,00:09:06.83,>> THEY WEREN'T EDIBLE?
195,00:09:07.83,00:09:07.83,>> THEY WERE FINE.
196,00:09:08.83,00:09:08.83,>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
197,00:09:10.25,00:09:10.25,>> HOLLY SNAPPED AT JILL
198,00:09:12.00,00:09:12.00,AND IT WAS REALLY KIND OF A BIZARRE TYPE THING.
199,00:09:14.58,00:09:14.58,I'M JUST KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED
200,00:09:16.58,00:09:16.58,THAT SHE CAN TURN IT AROUND BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
201,00:09:20.42,00:09:20.42,">> SHE'S CRAZY AS (\\NO AUDIO\\), MAN."

206,00:09:34.08,00:09:34.08,SO I THINK THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WITH DAN
207,00:09:38.58,00:09:38.58,IS TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO RELEASE MY ANGER.
208,00:09:42.33,00:09:42.33,"THE NEW YORK CITY BOY, DAN, HE DOESN'T LIKE SAND ON HIM."
209,00:09:45.96,00:09:45.96,"SO LET'S JUST FILL HIS SHOES UP, AND THEN..."

214,00:09:57.12,00:09:57.12,AND LET THEM RUB THINGS IN MY FACE.
215,00:10:00.38,00:10:00.38,I'VE BEEN TOO NICE UP TO THIS POINT.
216,00:10:03.12,00:10:03.12,BUT THE GAME HAS JUST BEGUN.

228,00:10:48.21,00:10:48.21,>> WERE THEY EXPENSIVE?
229,00:10:49.38,00:10:49.38,">> $1,600."
230,00:10:50.46,00:10:50.46,>> WHAT? FOR A PAIR OF SHOES?
231,00:10:51.96,00:10:51.96,">> OH, MY GOD."
232,00:10:53.12,00:10:53.12,>> THAT MEANS SOMEBODY HERE WANTS TO PLAY GAMES.
233,00:10:55.96,00:10:55.96,>> TOO EARLY TO START PLAYING GAMES AND HIDING STUFF.
234,00:11:07.92,00:11:07.92,">> RIGHT NOW, I'M STRUGGLING EMOTIONALLY."
235,00:11:10.29,00:11:10.29,THIS GAME IS TURNING ME INTO SOMEBODY I'M NOT.

237,00:11:15.08,00:11:15.08,AND I'M REALIZING THIS MIGHT NOT BE FOR ME.
238,00:11:18.42,00:11:18.42,I DID THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE I SHOULDN'T HAVE AND IT BOTHERS ME
239,00:11:21.83,00:11:21.83,SO I THINK IT'S BEST IF I COME CLEAN.
240,00:11:24.58,00:11:24.58,CAN WE HAVE A TRIBE MEETING?
241,00:11:26.25,00:11:26.25,>> YOU HAVE THE FLOOR.

587,00:25:36.42,00:25:36.42,TO GET PEOPLE WHIPPED UP AND IN LINE.
588,00:25:38.17,00:25:38.17,>> ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE SEEN US HERE.
589,00:25:39.92,00:25:39.92,WE GOT TO FIND THIS THING.
590,00:25:41.29,00:25:41.29,EVERYBODY WILL BE BACK HERE DIGGING.
591,00:25:42.25,00:25:42.25,WE GOT TO FIND IT.
592,00:25:43.67,00:25:43.67,">> GOT TO KEEP DIGGING. WE CAN'T GIVE UP, I GUESS."
593,00:25:45.46,00:25:45.46,>> WE I KNOW IT'S HERE.
594,00:25:46.67,00:25:46.67,>> I KNOW WE MUST BE CLOSE.
595,00:25:48.67,00:25:48.67,>> IT'S RIGHT HERE.
596,00:25:50.04,00:25:50.04,>> OH!
597,00:25:54.08,00:25:54.08,"THE IDOL. JILL, I GOT IT IT."
598,00:25:56.17,00:25:56.17,"I GOT THE IDOL, BABY."
599,00:25:58.29,00:25:58.29,I GOT THE FIRST... WE GOT THE IDOL.
600,00:26:00.46,00:26:00.46,">> WE GOT THE IDOL. >> DO NOT FORGET, WE GOT IT."
601,00:26:03.29,00:26:03.29,I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND THE IDOL
602,00:26:05.21,00:26:05.21,"IF JILL HAD NOT GIVEN THE CLUE ABOUT TREE MAIL,"
603,00:26:07.38,00:26:07.38,NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
604,00:26:08.58,00:26:08.58,"JILL, THIS IS SO MONEY."
605,00:26:10.96,00:26:10.96,"SO THE CHALLENGE NOW IS, HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK?"
606,00:26:18.08,00:26:18.08,>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE FUN TONIGHT.
607,00:26:21.75,00:26:21.75,>> I KNOW.
608,00:26:23.38,00:26:23.38,>> I DON'T LIKE THIS.
609,00:26:26.12,00:26:26.12,>> BLAME THE MEDALLION. >> YEAH.
610,00:26:27.08,00:26:27.08,>> BLAME THAT ONE BALL. >> RIGHT.
611,00:26:28.50,00:26:28.50,>> IT'S THE BEST THING WE CAN DO. >> RIGHT.
612,00:26:30.29,00:26:30.29,>> THOSE GIRLS ARE SAVAGE.
613,00:26:31.62,00:26:31.62,>> THEY WERE AWESOME.
614,00:26:35.08,00:26:35.08,">> ...WORRIED ABOUT, BUT SHE DOMINATED IT."
615,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,>> WE HAD A GOOD CHALLENGE TODAY SO THAT YOU COULD FINALLY SHOW
616,00:26:40.50,00:26:40.50,THAT YOU'RE JUST AS ATHLETIC AS THE REST OF US.
617,00:26:44.00,00:26:44.00,>> TODAY I SAT OUT AT THE CHALLENGE
618,00:26:46.12,00:26:46.12,BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE IF KELLY B.
619,00:26:47.71,00:26:47.71,WAS GOING TO USE HER LEG AS AN EXCUSE
620,00:26:49.17,00:26:49.17,BECAUSE IT WAS A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE.
621,00:26:50.96,00:26:50.96,"I WAS VERY PROUD OF HER, THE FACT THAT SHE DIDN'T DO THAT."
622,00:26:54.17,00:26:54.17,"I MEAN, SHE'S JUST... SHE'S JUST AWESOME."
623,00:26:56.21,00:26:56.21,"I DON'T LIKE HER, BUT SHE'S JUST AWESOME."
624,00:26:58.04,00:26:58.04,>> WHO ARE WE VOTING? NAY.
625,00:26:59.25,00:26:59.25,>> WE'RE EITHER GOING BRENDA OR NAY.
626,00:27:05.04,00:27:05.04,">> WELL, SEE THAT'S WHY IT WILL BE EASY TO GET RID OF HER LATER."
627,00:27:07.04,00:27:07.04,">> EXACTLY, BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE BRENDA NOW."
628,00:27:11.12,00:27:11.12,">> I THINK BRENDA DEFINITELY HAS A THING FOR CHASE,"
629,00:27:13.12,00:27:13.12,BECAUSE THEY HANG OUT A LOT.
630,00:27:14.50,00:27:14.50,SO WE'RE KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT THEM
631,00:27:16.17,00:27:16.17,"'CAUSE HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY AND,"
632,00:27:17.21,00:27:17.21,"YOU KNOW, HE'S GOING TO TELL HER THINGS."
633,00:27:19.04,00:27:19.04,"AND THEY MIGHT TRY TO WORK THAT ANGLE,"
634,00:27:20.96,00:27:20.96,SO WE HAVE TO BREAK THAT UP.
635,00:27:23.12,00:27:23.12,(snorting)
636,00:27:27.46,00:27:27.46,">> WELL, I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS WHO I WANT TO GET RID OF."
637,00:27:29.29,00:27:29.29,"I WANT TO WRITE DOWN NAONKA, MAN."
638,00:27:32.96,00:27:32.96,>> CHASE?
639,00:27:36.29,00:27:36.29,>> WHO ARE YOU WRITING DOWN?
640,00:27:38.08,00:27:38.08,>> EVERYBODY SAID THEY'RE WRITING DOWN NAY.
641,00:27:40.79,00:27:40.79,>> WHY?
642,00:27:42.12,00:27:42.12,"SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE BEING A LITTLE EMOTIONAL, DOESN'T IT?"
643,00:27:45.71,00:27:45.71,>> WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE?
644,00:27:47.08,00:27:47.08,>> I THINK BRENDA'S GONNA BE MORE OF A THREAT.
645,00:27:49.00,00:27:49.00,WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT OUT THERE.
646,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17,>> CHASE IS CONSTANTLY GOING OFF ON BRENDA ALL THE TIME.
647,00:27:54.92,00:27:54.92,"I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GETTING BLINDED BY A WOMAN,"
648,00:27:57.50,00:27:57.50,"BUT KELLY B. AND ALINA-- THEY'RE KIND OF NERVOUS,"
649,00:28:00.88,00:28:00.88,"AND I'M GETTING KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT BRENDA, TOO."
650,00:28:06.42,00:28:06.42,>> ...THEY'RE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW.
651,00:28:07.67,00:28:07.67,"THEY HAVE THREE, AND THEY HAVE FOUR WITH SASH."
652,00:28:09.83,00:28:09.83,THEY NEED YOU ALL TWO.
653,00:28:11.29,00:28:11.29,WHY DO YOU THINK BRENDA'S CLINGING TO YOU?
654,00:28:13.58,00:28:13.58,"SHE'S TRYING TO PLAY YOUR ASS,"
655,00:28:15.29,00:28:15.29,AND WE'RE TOO STRONG OF A TRIBE TO GO SCREW THIS ALL UP
656,00:28:18.21,00:28:18.21,AND GO LOSE TO SOME OLD ASSES.
657,00:28:19.62,00:28:19.62,>> BUT WE GOT TO TAKE BRENDA OUT FIRST.
658,00:28:22.46,00:28:22.46,>> I HATE TO PUT YOU IN THAT POSITION
659,00:28:24.04,00:28:24.04,"BY VOTING BRENDA BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR GIRL, BUT..."
660,00:28:25.71,00:28:25.71,>> RIGHT.
661,00:28:27.17,00:28:27.17,I AM DEFINITELY IN A MESS RIGHT NOW.
662,00:28:29.08,00:28:29.08,"EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GAME,"
663,00:28:31.04,00:28:31.04,"I PRAYED THAT GOD COULD GIVE ME SOMEONE THAT I COULD TRUST,"
664,00:28:33.12,00:28:33.12,AND I FEEL THAT BRENDA WAS THAT PERSON RIGHT FROM THE START.
665,00:28:36.50,00:28:36.50,"BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH SHANNON."
666,00:28:40.12,00:28:40.12,AND NOW HE WANTS BRENDA SENT HOME FIRST.
667,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,"SO, I'M CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO DIFFERENT ALLIANCES."
668,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,AND I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
669,00:28:48.71,00:28:48.71,>> I JUST WANT TO SECURE US TO GO TO THE FINAL THING.
670,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17,THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO.
671,00:28:52.88,00:28:52.88,CHASE-- HE KIND OF FEELS BAD ABOUT SENDING BRENDA HOME
672,00:28:55.67,00:28:55.67,"'CAUSE OF HER FEELINGS, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."
673,00:28:57.29,00:28:57.29,BUT CHASE IS MY NUMBER ONE GUY.
674,00:29:00.12,00:29:00.12,"AND IF MY ALLIANCES ARE DOING WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING,"
675,00:29:02.08,00:29:02.08,"THEN, BRENDA'S THE FIRST ONE TO GO."
676,00:29:23.17,00:29:23.17,>> HE'S TALKING TO EVERYBODY TELLING EVERYBODY OFF...
677,00:29:24.83,00:29:24.83,>> YEAH. IS HE TALKING TO YOU?
678,00:29:26.25,00:29:26.25,>> HE HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING TO ME.
679,00:29:27.54,00:29:27.54,>> IS HE'S TALKING TO ME?
680,00:29:28.79,00:29:28.79,>> RIGHT. >> THERE YOU GO.
681,00:29:34.04,00:29:34.04,">> ME, TOO. HE'S A PUPPY. >> YEAH."
682,00:29:36.50,00:29:36.50,">> THE SECOND PERSON I WANT IS-- WHAT'S HIS NAM-- JUDE, JUD?"
683,00:29:38.38,00:29:38.38,>> YEAH. >> GONE.
684,00:29:41.25,00:29:41.25,>> I LIKE YOUR LIST.
685,00:29:42.58,00:29:42.58,">> YESTERDAY, I WENT OFF ON FABIO,"
686,00:29:45.12,00:29:45.12,AND IT WAS JUST BECAUSE HE RUBBED ME THE WRONG WAY.
687,00:29:47.08,00:29:47.08,I CAN'T STAND HIM. HE CAN'T STAND ME.
688,00:29:48.96,00:29:48.96,"SO, I WANT FABIO OUT OF HERE, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO OUT,"
689,00:29:52.54,00:29:52.54,"LIKE, TONIGHT, BECAUSE HE'S NOT A THREAT TO ANYONE."
690,00:29:55.17,00:29:55.17,"BUT SHANNON-- HE'S MAKING HIMSELF A THREAT RIGHT NOW,"
691,00:29:58.33,00:29:58.33,TALKING TO EVERYBODY.
692,00:30:00.21,00:30:00.21,"AND I'M, LIKE, ""YOU WANT TO DO THAT?"
693,00:30:01.79,00:30:01.79,"""OKAY, WELL, JUST KNOW YOU HAVE BUILT YOUR OWN STEPPING STONE"
694,00:30:04.54,00:30:04.54,"TO THE GRAVE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL."""
695,00:30:06.46,00:30:06.46,SASH-- HE HASN'T TALKED TO YOU
696,00:30:08.33,00:30:08.33,ABOUT WHAT HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT.
697,00:30:09.58,00:30:09.58,>> WHICH IS WHAT?
698,00:30:11.12,00:30:11.12,>> HE WANTS TO BRING ALL OF US MINORITIES TO THE END.
699,00:30:13.67,00:30:13.67,DID HE TELL YOU THAT?
700,00:30:15.12,00:30:15.12,>> NO. >> YEAH.
701,00:30:16.08,00:30:16.08,I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT.
702,00:30:17.38,00:30:17.38,>> THAT IS HIS PLAN. >> I LIKE SASH.
703,00:30:19.67,00:30:19.67,>> YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?
704,00:30:21.25,00:30:21.25,I HAVE PEOPLE ON MY SIDE WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.
705,00:30:23.46,00:30:23.46,I GET A GOOD VIBE FROM NAY.
706,00:30:25.29,00:30:25.29,SASH WAS SAYING HOW HE WANTS TO BE AN ALLIANCE.
707,00:30:27.71,00:30:27.71,I FEEL LIKE I CAN GET KELLY PURPLE.
708,00:30:29.25,00:30:29.25,AND I'M REALLY TIGHT WITH CHASE. THAT MAKES FIVE.
709,00:30:32.46,00:30:32.46,">> CHASE TALKS TO ME, AND I FEEL LIKE HE'S REAL."
710,00:30:34.88,00:30:34.88,">> YEAH: >> I DO FEEL LIKE HE'S NERVOUS, THOUGH."
711,00:30:37.29,00:30:37.29,>> I THOUGHT HE WAS HE WAS STRONGER THAN THAT.
712,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,">> HE'S NOT, AND IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE WE COULD RULE THIS."
713,00:30:42.08,00:30:42.08,">> LIKE, DO I HAVE YOUR WORD?"
714,00:30:43.29,00:30:43.29,>> DEFINITELY.
715,00:30:44.50,00:30:44.50,>> WE'RE TAKING SHANNON OUT.
716,00:30:50.46,00:30:50.46,>> THAT ONE RIGHT THERE. >> YEAH.
717,00:30:52.17,00:30:52.17,">> THEY HAVE SHANNON, ALINA, FABIO, BEN, AND KB."
718,00:30:56.21,00:30:56.21,AND THEY SAID THEY WANT YOU GONE FIRST.
719,00:30:59.96,00:30:59.96,I'M SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.
720,00:31:02.08,00:31:02.08,"EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS GAME,"
721,00:31:03.42,00:31:03.42,I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO I CAN TRUST
722,00:31:05.79,00:31:05.79,AND WHO I CAN PLAY THE GAME WITH.
723,00:31:07.21,00:31:07.21,"I LIKED SHANNON RIGHT AWAY, AND HE WANTED TO BE ALIGNED WITH ME,"
724,00:31:10.58,00:31:10.58,BUT NOW THERE'S JUST A FEELING
725,00:31:12.25,00:31:12.25,THAT I HAVE THAT'S NOT RIGHT ABOUT HIM.
726,00:31:13.88,00:31:13.88,I DID NOT WANT TO PLAY THE GAME THIS WAY.
727,00:31:15.33,00:31:15.33,"I THOUGHT I WOULD BE ABLE TO COME IN, NOT TALK MUCH..."
728,00:31:17.17,00:31:17.17,">> WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT SHANNON IS THE ONE"
729,00:31:18.96,00:31:18.96,"CALLING ALL THE SHOTS,"
730,00:31:20.21,00:31:20.21,SO WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST WANT TO TAKE HIM OUT FIRST?
731,00:31:22.92,00:31:22.92,WHY DO YOU NEED HIM?
732,00:31:24.08,00:31:24.08,TELL ME A GOOD REASON WHY YOU NEED HIM.
733,00:31:25.58,00:31:25.58,>> I DON'T NEED HIM AT ALL.
734,00:31:27.00,00:31:27.00,">> SO, THEN WHY WOULD YOU KEEP HIM?"
735,00:31:28.21,00:31:28.21,>> HE'S THE ONE CALLING THE SHOTS.
736,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,">> VERY TRUE, THAT'S RIGHT."
737,00:31:30.46,00:31:30.46,>> HE'S THE ONE TALKING AND MOTIVATING PEOPLE
738,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,AND WHISPERING THINGS IN THEIR EAR.
739,00:31:33.92,00:31:33.92,"SO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T TAKE HIM OUT FIRST."
740,00:31:37.29,00:31:37.29,">> WELL, WE COULD. NUMBERS, YOU, ME, UM..."
741,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,>> PURPLE.  >> KELLY PURPLE.

743,00:31:42.50,00:31:42.50,>> I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT

747,00:31:50.67,00:31:50.67,BUT CHASE-- I THINK HE WANTS TO KEEP ME HERE
748,00:31:54.00,00:31:54.00,BECAUSE HE JUST TRUSTS ME.
749,00:31:55.42,00:31:55.42,BUT IT'S LOOKING LIKE IT WILL BE A TIE--
750,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,"FIVE FOR ME, AND FIVE FOR SHANNON--"
751,00:31:59.67,00:31:59.67,SO WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

756,00:32:12.17,00:32:12.17,AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
757,00:32:14.25,00:32:14.25,"GUYS, CHASE IS WITH THEM."
758,00:32:16.96,00:32:16.96,>> ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
759,00:32:18.38,00:32:18.38,>> YEAH! BRENDA STIRRED IT UP.
760,00:32:19.88,00:32:19.88,>> BRENDA STIRRED IT UP.
761,00:32:21.25,00:32:21.25,>> BRENDA IS SO MUCH MORE OF A THREAT.
762,00:32:22.71,00:32:22.71,"SHE HAS HER LITTLE CHARM ON HIM, I'M TELLING YOU."

767,00:32:30.96,00:32:30.96,AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS.
768,00:32:32.50,00:32:32.50,AND WE'RE WONDERING IF CHASE IS GOING TO LIE
769,00:32:34.75,00:32:34.75,"TO BRENDA AND VOTE HER OUT,"
770,00:32:36.08,00:32:36.08,"OR TELL THE FOUR OF US ONE THING, AND THEN FLIP."

778,00:32:52.67,00:32:52.67,I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST.
779,00:32:54.00,00:32:54.00,"IF CHASE IS A MAN OF HIS WORD,"
780,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,THEN BRENDA WILL GO HOME TONIGHT.
781,00:32:57.75,00:32:57.75,"IF NOT, I HAVE A BIG TARGET ON MY BACK."
782,00:33:00.12,00:33:00.12,>> SOMEBODY WILL BE EATING PEANUT BUTTER
783,00:33:02.21,00:33:02.21,AND JELLY SANDWICHES TONIGHT.
784,00:33:03.92,00:33:03.92,>> SOMEBODY WILL BE.
785,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS A TORCH.
786,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH AND APPROACH A FLAME.
787,00:33:26.12,00:33:26.12,DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
788,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF TRIBAL COUNCIL
789,00:33:31.79,00:33:31.79,BECAUSE FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
790,00:33:34.17,00:33:34.17,"AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE, YOU'RE STILL IN THE GAME."
791,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,"WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE YOU."
792,00:33:40.21,00:33:40.21,WELCOME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
793,00:33:43.04,00:33:43.04,"SO, SHANNON, HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT"
794,00:33:45.04,00:33:45.04,HAS THIS ADVENTURE BEEN THAN YOU ANTICIPATED?
795,00:33:47.42,00:33:47.42,">> OH, IT'S BEEN BRUTAL."
796,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,"I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN CAMPING A DAY IN MY LIFE"
797,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,SO THIS IS THE WORST THING I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.
798,00:33:52.21,00:33:52.21,IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S GOTTEN BETTER.
799,00:33:53.42,00:33:53.42,I'M HERE. I'LL WING IT OUT.
800,00:33:55.08,00:33:55.08,"BUT IT'S BEEN INTERESTING. WE'VE HAD PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,"
801,00:33:57.25,00:33:57.25,"SAY WE'RE ALL TOGETHER, AND THEN I'M COMING TO FIND OUT"
802,00:34:00.54,00:34:00.54,THERE'S NO LOYALTY. SO WE'LL SEE.
803,00:34:03.42,00:34:03.42,HE BETTER HOPE HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYS WITH HIM ON THIS TRIBE
804,00:34:05.62,00:34:05.62,"TONIGHT BECAUSE IF NOT, HE'LL BE GOING HOME NEXT."
805,00:34:07.46,00:34:07.46,>> Jeff: WOW!
806,00:34:08.58,00:34:08.58,>> HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.
807,00:34:09.79,00:34:09.79,>> Jeff: WHO'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND?
808,00:34:11.62,00:34:11.62,>> I GUESS-- I GUESS--
809,00:34:12.62,00:34:12.62,>> EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S BRENDA.
810,00:34:13.88,00:34:13.88,>> SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.
811,00:34:15.21,00:34:15.21,FROM DAY ONE I TRUSTED BRENDA AND I TRUSTED BEN.
812,00:34:17.46,00:34:17.46,THOSE WERE THE TWO PEOPLE I TRUSTED THE MOST.
813,00:34:20.67,00:34:20.67,>> Jeff: SHANNON?
814,00:34:21.67,00:34:21.67,>> CAN I SAY WHY IT'S LIKE THIS?
815,00:34:23.17,00:34:23.17,I THOUGHT CHASE HAD MY BACK AND I THOUGHT WE WERE THERE
816,00:34:25.21,00:34:25.21,AND WE'RE NOT NOT AND IT PISSES ME OFF.
817,00:34:27.25,00:34:27.25,ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS BE HONEST AND SAY YOU'RE WITH HER.
818,00:34:30.29,00:34:30.29,>> I'M COMING OUT WITH THE TRUTH.
819,00:34:31.62,00:34:31.62,I'VE BEEN BETWEEN TWO ALLIANCES AND BEFORE WE CAME OUT HERE
820,00:34:35.29,00:34:35.29,"I WAS VERY, VERY UNSURE WHO I WANTED TO VOTE FOR,"
821,00:34:39.12,00:34:39.12,WHETHER I WANTED TO VOTE FOR SHANNON OR VOTE OFF BRENDA.
822,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,THAT'S AS HONEST AS YOU CAN GET.
823,00:34:44.67,00:34:44.67,>> YOU START OFF WITH ALL YOUR INTEGRITY AND LOYALTY.
824,00:34:46.75,00:34:46.75,WHERE'S IT BEEN?
825,00:34:47.96,00:34:47.96,YOU'VE BEEN LYING AND GOING BOTH WAYS.
826,00:34:50.54,00:34:50.54,">> Jeff: I'VE GOT TO SAY, 21 SEASONS OF ""SURVIVOR,"""
827,00:34:54.67,00:34:54.67,NEVER HAD AN OPENING QUESTION OPEN THAT MUCH WHOOP-ASS
828,00:34:57.58,00:34:57.58,ON A TRIBE EVER.
829,00:34:59.58,00:34:59.58,>> I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW HOW UPSET I AM.
830,00:35:01.33,00:35:01.33,BECAUSE I GAVE MY WORD.
831,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,">> Jeff: WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE, JUD?"
832,00:35:06.71,00:35:06.71,>> I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL SHANNON TO NOT MAKE ENEMIES.
833,00:35:09.12,00:35:09.12,"HE JUST GETS AGGRESSIVE SO QUICK AND I'M TRYING TO TELL HIM,"
834,00:35:12.21,00:35:12.21,"THAT'S NOT SMART, MAN."
835,00:35:14.21,00:35:14.21,">> FABIO, HOME BOY IS TRYING TO VOTE ME OUT."
836,00:35:15.58,00:35:15.58,I'M NOT MAKING AN ENEMY.
837,00:35:17.08,00:35:17.08,HE KNOWS IF THAT DOESN'T GO DOWN TONIGHT HE GOES NEXT.
838,00:35:20.00,00:35:20.00,">> Jeff: BRENDA, CONVENIENTLY YOU ARE CENTERED IN THE MIDDLE"
839,00:35:23.33,00:35:23.33,OF THIS WHOLE THING WITH SHANNON LOSING HIS MIND BEHIND YOU.
840,00:35:26.71,00:35:26.71,>> I THINK IT JUST SHOWS A CERTAIN WEAKNESS
841,00:35:28.75,00:35:28.75,HAS BEEN EXPOSED.
842,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,IT'S HARD TO TRUST HIM.
843,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,">> NOBODY HERE TRUSTS YOU, BUD."
844,00:35:33.96,00:35:33.96,">> FABIO, YOU DON'T TRUST ME?"
845,00:35:35.08,00:35:35.08,">> I DO, MAN."
846,00:35:37.21,00:35:37.21,>> YOU DON'T TRUST ME? I TOLD YOU TO VOTE ONE WAY?
847,00:35:38.88,00:35:38.88,"HOW ABOUT ALINA, KB, HAVE I LIED TO YOU ALL?"
848,00:35:42.08,00:35:42.08,>> I TRUST YOU.
849,00:35:43.33,00:35:43.33,>> I'M NOT LYING TO ANYBODY.
850,00:35:44.92,00:35:44.92,">> Jeff: BUT, SHANNON, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE"
851,00:35:47.92,00:35:47.92,THE WISEST MOVE TO THROW IT ALL OUT HERE BEFORE A VOTE?
852,00:35:52.04,00:35:52.04,>> I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON WHEN I AM UPSET
853,00:35:54.04,00:35:54.04,AND SOMEBODY HAS BETRAYED ME LIKE THAT
854,00:35:55.58,00:35:55.58,I'LL SPEAK MY MIND AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
855,00:35:56.92,00:35:56.92,>> YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH DIGGING YOUR OWN GRAVE.
856,00:35:59.50,00:35:59.50,>> I'M GONNA GET THIS OUT OF THE WAY-- ARE YOU GAY?
857,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,>> I'M SURE I'VE HAD A LOT MORE BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIENDS
858,00:36:12.25,00:36:12.25,"THAN YOU HAVE, BUDDY."
859,00:36:13.38,00:36:13.38,">> YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T, MY BROTHER, BUT GOOD LUCK."
860,00:36:15.17,00:36:15.17,"TRUST ME, YOU HAVEN'T."
861,00:36:16.17,00:36:16.17,>> I'M 100%.
862,00:36:17.17,00:36:17.17,>> TRUST ME.
863,00:36:18.58,00:36:18.58,>> I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU WORK YOUR MAGIC IN NEW YORK.
864,00:36:20.58,00:36:20.58,>> NEW YORK IS FULL OF A BUNCH OF GAY PEOPLE.
865,00:36:24.38,00:36:24.38,>> Jeff: NEW YORK IS FULL OF GAY PEOPLE.
866,00:36:26.33,00:36:26.33,">> THEY GOT A LOT OF THEM, JEFF, MORE THAN IN LOUISIANA."
867,00:36:29.12,00:36:29.12,">> BE QUIET, DUDE!"
868,00:36:30.46,00:36:30.46,"WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM FOR THE NEXT TWO, THREE WEEKS."
869,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,">> Jeff: FABIO, GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE TREES."
870,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,THIS IS A TRIBE COMPLETELY DIVIDED
871,00:36:37.71,00:36:37.71,"AND IF EXPERIENCE MEANS ANYTHING,"
872,00:36:39.62,00:36:39.62,IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH SAILING FOR YOU GUYS.
873,00:36:42.92,00:36:42.92,"ALINA, IS IT FOOLISH TO BELIEVE YOU CAN TRUST SOMEBODY"
874,00:36:46.21,00:36:46.21,SIX DAYS IN OF A MILLION-DOLLAR GAME.
875,00:36:49.75,00:36:49.75,>> IT'S VERY FOOLISH.
876,00:36:51.00,00:36:51.00,"I THOUGHT I TRUSTED CHASE, TOO."
877,00:36:52.50,00:36:52.50,AND IT'S FUNNY EVERYBODY IS SAYING SHANNON IS THE ONE
878,00:36:56.08,00:36:56.08,NOBODY CAN TRUST BUT SHANNON HASN'T SAID A LIE TO ME
879,00:36:58.29,00:36:58.29,BUT CHASE HAS.
880,00:37:01.29,00:37:01.29,>> SURPRISED TRUST IS THIS BIG OF AN ISSUE THIS FAST?
881,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,>> ABSOLUTELY.
882,00:37:06.42,00:37:06.42,IT HAPPENED SO FAST HOW THERE WAS ALL OF A SUDDEN
883,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,TWO ALLIANCES AND YOU WERE EITHER ON THIS SIDE
884,00:37:11.12,00:37:11.12,OR THIS SIDE.
885,00:37:12.67,00:37:12.67,"I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO TO TRUST ANYMORE, EITHER."
886,00:37:17.17,00:37:17.17,">> Jeff: BRENDA, WHY ARE YOU A TARGET?"
887,00:37:19.08,00:37:19.08,>> I'M GUESSING IT'S BECAUSE SHANNON WANTS TO TAKE OUT
888,00:37:21.96,00:37:21.96,"A STRONG GIRL, BUT I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE"
889,00:37:24.38,00:37:24.38,"HE WOULD CHOOSE SOMEONE LIKE ME BECAUSE I'M REALLY NOT,"
890,00:37:27.08,00:37:27.08,"YOU KNOW, SITTING HERE PLOTTING ALL DAY LONG."
891,00:37:29.29,00:37:29.29,">> THE THING IS, JEFF, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE ON THE TRIBE"
892,00:37:31.12,00:37:31.12,"THOUGHT SHE WAS A THREAT, NOT JUST ME."
893,00:37:32.75,00:37:32.75,"AND EVEN TODAY, IT WAS NAY."
894,00:37:34.58,00:37:34.58,"AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK, AND THEN IT CHANGED"
895,00:37:36.21,00:37:36.21,BECAUSE WE FELT BRENDA WOULD BE THE BIGGER THREAT
896,00:37:38.25,00:37:38.25,TO THE OTHER GIRLS IN OUR ALLIANCE.
897,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,">> Jeff: NAONKA, IS THAT NEWS TO YOU?"
898,00:37:42.12,00:37:42.12,>> I THOUGHT MAYBE IF THEY WERE GONNA VOTE ME OUT
899,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T DO THE CHALLENGE TODAY
900,00:37:46.29,00:37:46.29,AND I WAS HOPING WE WERE GOING TO WIN SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE
901,00:37:48.67,00:37:48.67,TO BE HERE BECAUSE WE WERE STRONG.
902,00:37:50.38,00:37:50.38,WE WERE A UNIT.
903,00:37:52.08,00:37:52.08,">> Jeff: YOU WERE NOT TIGHT, NAONKA,"
904,00:37:53.79,00:37:53.79,"AND IF YOU'RE STILL THINKING YOU ARE,"
905,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THE TREE FABIO IS UP IN.
906,00:37:57.67,00:37:57.67,">> OH, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT TREE."
907,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,>> Jeff: SO YOU DON'T LIKE FABIO?
908,00:38:00.67,00:38:00.67,>> NOPE.
909,00:38:01.88,00:38:01.88,>> Jeff: WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS?
910,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,>> EVERY TIME I SAY SOMETHING TO HIM
911,00:38:05.75,00:38:05.75,HE HAS SOMETHING SMART TO SAY LIKE I'M DUMB.
912,00:38:08.12,00:38:08.12,AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY HOW I FEEL ABOUT FABIO.
913,00:38:10.92,00:38:10.92,"FABIO, I DON'T LIKE YOU."
914,00:38:14.12,00:38:14.12,>> Jeff: OKAY.
915,00:38:15.29,00:38:15.29,"FABIO, SHE DON'T LIKE YOU."
916,00:38:17.00,00:38:17.00,>> THAT ATTITUDE HAS BEEN PRESENT THE WHOLE TIME.
917,00:38:19.38,00:38:19.38,"AND I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP IT COOL,"
918,00:38:21.08,00:38:21.08,BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY HARD TO DO THAT.
919,00:38:22.92,00:38:22.92,>> HE DON'T TRY HARD ENOUGH.
920,00:38:24.96,00:38:24.96,">> Jeff: NAONKA, ARE YOU A LITTLE COMPLICATED?"
921,00:38:27.38,00:38:27.38,ME?
922,00:38:28.58,00:38:28.58,NO!
923,00:38:29.83,00:38:29.83,AM I?
924,00:38:34.96,00:38:34.96,>> CAN WE VOTE?
925,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,>> CAN WE?
926,00:38:37.12,00:38:37.12,>> Jeff: HOLD ON.
927,00:38:38.46,00:38:38.46,"KELLY B., FIRST BIG VOTE."
928,00:38:40.92,00:38:40.92,I'M GUESSING IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD THING
929,00:38:42.33,00:38:42.33,TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY.
930,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,WHAT'S THE CRITERIA?
931,00:38:45.12,00:38:45.12,">> UM, I'M KIND OF WONDERING WHAT'S GOING"
932,00:38:47.21,00:38:47.21,TO UNIFY OUR TRIBE THE MOST.
933,00:38:49.25,00:38:49.25,I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE NEED IS UNITY AS A TRIBE
934,00:38:51.75,00:38:51.75,"SO WE CAN GO BACK AND WIN THE OTHER CHALLENGES,"
935,00:38:53.42,00:38:53.42,AND I THINK THAT'S HOW PEOPLE WILL VOTE TONIGHT.
936,00:38:59.67,00:38:59.67,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO VOTE, WE'LL VOTE."
937,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,"KELLY B., YOU'RE UP."
938,00:39:14.67,00:39:14.67,>> I GUESS THIS IS STILL OUR GAME PLAN?
939,00:39:17.29,00:39:17.29,I DON'T REALLY KNOW.
940,00:39:28.46,00:39:28.46,>> IT WAS EITHER ME OR HIM SO THIS WAS AN EASY VOTE FOR ME.
941,00:39:51.83,00:39:51.83,>> YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO HAVE MESSED
942,00:39:53.08,00:39:53.08,WITH THE BIGGEST BACHELOR IN NEW YORK.
943,00:39:55.33,00:39:55.33,"AS THEY SAY IN NICARAGUA, HASTA LA VISTA."
944,00:40:11.08,00:40:11.08,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
945,00:40:25.58,00:40:25.58,ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE DECISION IS FINAL.
946,00:40:27.92,00:40:27.92,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
947,00:40:29.08,00:40:29.08,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
948,00:40:30.96,00:40:30.96,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
949,00:40:34.21,00:40:34.21,"FIRST VOTE, SHANNON."
950,00:40:39.42,00:40:39.42,BRENDA.
951,00:40:43.50,00:40:43.50,SHANNON.
952,00:40:45.17,00:40:45.17,"TWO VOTES SHANNON, ONE VOTE BRENDA."
953,00:40:48.54,00:40:48.54,BRENDA.
954,00:40:49.88,00:40:49.88,"TIED AGAIN, TWO VOTES SHANNON, TWO VOTES BRENDA."
955,00:40:54.21,00:40:54.21,SHANNON.
956,00:40:55.29,00:40:55.29,"THREE VOTE SHANNON, TWO VOTES BRENDA."
957,00:40:59.29,00:40:59.29,BRENDA.
958,00:41:00.67,00:41:00.67,"WE'RE TIED, THREE VOTES SHANNON, THREE VOTES BRENDA."
959,00:41:05.46,00:41:05.46,SHANNON.
960,00:41:07.00,00:41:07.00,"THAT'S FOUR VOTES SHANNON, THREE VOTES BRENDA."
961,00:41:11.79,00:41:11.79,SHANNON.
962,00:41:13.29,00:41:13.29,"THAT'S FIVE VOTES SHANNON, THREE VOTES BRENDA."
963,00:41:18.21,00:41:18.21,"SECOND PERSON VOTED OUT OF ""SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA,"" SHANNON."
964,00:41:21.79,00:41:21.79,THAT'S SIX. THAT'S ENOUGH.
965,00:41:22.79,00:41:22.79,YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
966,00:41:30.46,00:41:30.46,"SHANNON, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
967,00:41:35.12,00:41:35.12,TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
968,00:41:49.21,00:41:49.21,"WELL, IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL"
