508,00:17:32.20,00:17:32.20,MAINLY BY STAYING SILENT AND

510,00:17:36.00,00:17:36.00,IT WAS A PERSONAL DECISION.
511,00:17:36.70,00:17:36.70,I VIEWED IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
512,00:17:37.73,00:17:37.73,TAKE CONTROL OF MY OWN FATE IN
513,00:17:39.27,00:17:39.27,THIS GAME TO PLAY WITH THE SORT

534,00:18:10.30,00:18:10.30,I SAVED COCHRAN IN THE SECOND
535,00:18:12.07,00:18:12.07,VOTE.
536,00:18:12.80,00:18:12.80,"KEITH, WHITNEY, AND I, SAVED HIM"

1073,00:34:12.90,00:34:12.90,BETTER AT THIS STAGE TO BE THAT
1074,00:34:14.47,00:34:14.47,KIND OF PERSON BECAUSE I'M

1079,00:34:22.47,00:34:22.47,IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHETHER I
1080,00:34:24.00,00:34:24.00,CAN HANG ON LONG ENOUGH.
1081,00:34:32.63,00:34:32.63,"JIM, I CAN BEAT JIM IN A LOT OF"
1082,00:34:34.93,00:34:34.93,THOSE TYPE CHALLENGES.
1083,00:34:42.30,00:34:42.30,WE SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.
1084,00:34:44.07,00:34:44.07,"ALBERT, HE'S GETTING NERVOUS."

1087,00:34:47.90,00:34:47.90,I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT
1088,00:34:48.90,00:34:48.90,THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IN GENERAL
1089,00:34:53.23,00:34:53.23,"""SURVIVOR"" STRAIT SNEE."

1094,00:35:03.57,00:35:03.57,JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A GREATER

1100,00:35:18.50,00:35:18.50,AT THIS MOMENT.

1123,00:36:04.90,00:36:04.90,"FOR DAWN, JIM, AND WHITNEY, IS"
1124,00:36:06.50,00:36:06.50,IT FAIR TO ASSUME THAT SINCE

1132,00:36:20.47,00:36:20.47,I THINK THEY BOTH HAVE THEIR
1133,00:36:22.67,00:36:22.67,NICHES.

1250,00:39:07.03,00:39:07.03,I NEVER ONCE WAS A BULLY.
1251,00:39:08.30,00:39:08.30,IT'S HARD TO TAKE.
1252,00:39:09.30,00:39:09.30,I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.
1253,00:39:17.13,00:39:17.13,"Jeff: BRANDON, IS IT HARD"
1254,00:39:18.10,00:39:18.10,FOR YOU TO SEE WHITNEY CRYING?
