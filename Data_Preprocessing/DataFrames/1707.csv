12,00:00:36.71,00:00:36.71,That honor went to Dan.The tribe has spoken.

17,00:00:55.29,00:00:55.29,Who will be voted out tonight?>> What's so funny?
18,00:01:05.00,00:01:05.00,>> How was that compared to theother Tribal Councils you had?
19,00:01:08.46,00:01:08.46,">> Uh, the other ones are easy.(laughter)"
20,00:01:12.75,00:01:12.75,"That wasn't meant to be funny.>> No. Yeah, it was tough."
21,00:01:16.88,00:01:16.88,">> Yeah, I mean, I didn't say itto get people to laugh."
22,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67,Tonight was not fun.That was my friend that left.
23,00:01:21.46,00:01:21.46,">> Yeah.>> You know, think about what I"
24,00:01:24.42,00:01:24.42,"say before you just instantlystart laughing, 'cause not all"
25,00:01:28.04,00:01:28.04,the time I'm trying to be funny.We voted Dan off tonight.
26,00:01:32.29,00:01:32.29,"Uh, the vote was 4-3.I voted for Susie just in case"
27,00:01:36.42,00:01:36.42,Dan had the hidden immunityidol and could have taken
28,00:01:39.08,00:01:39.08,"anybody he wanted out.He was my friend, but he had to"
29,00:01:43.38,00:01:43.38,go.>> I would like to analyze
30,00:01:46.08,00:01:46.08,what our weaknesses are andshore 'em up.
31,00:01:48.17,00:01:48.17,Because I personally feel likethe merge is coming in the next
32,00:01:51.42,00:01:51.42,"couple days.>> Well, and the way I look at"
33,00:01:54.62,00:01:54.62,"it, operation clean sweep;these six mowing down that four."
34,00:01:58.17,00:01:58.17,"You know, this is the heart ofwho's left, the six of us."
35,00:02:01.46,00:02:01.46,>> Let's do it.>> We can make it happen.
36,00:02:04.12,00:02:04.12,">> We can't, like... I mean,I'm not trying to call you out,"
37,00:02:07.17,00:02:07.17,"particularly Susie, but like youcan't threaten to vote for"
38,00:02:09.46,00:02:09.46,Corinne and not tell somebodythat there is a problem there.
39,00:02:11.92,00:02:11.92,>> Yeah. When you and I had theconversation and you said I
40,00:02:14.50,00:02:14.50,"wasn't helpful around camp,you know, I understood that."
41,00:02:16.67,00:02:16.67,I'm sensitive to it now.But what I don't understand is
42,00:02:19.38,00:02:19.38,"during Tribal you had, like, alot of other gripes."
43,00:02:21.50,00:02:21.50,"Prior to going in, Susie toldme that she was gonna vote for"
44,00:02:24.17,00:02:24.17,me based on the fact that shedid not think I did enough work
45,00:02:26.92,00:02:26.92,"around camp.Well, then we get to Tribal."
46,00:02:29.25,00:02:29.25,Who's the weakest player in thegame?
47,00:02:31.12,00:02:31.12,I think Corinne's weakerthan me.
48,00:02:33.04,00:02:33.04,"I think I swim better thanCorinne, I think I have"
49,00:02:34.71,00:02:34.71,better upper-body strength.The woman is 47 years old.
50,00:02:36.42,00:02:36.42,What could she possibly haveover me?
51,00:02:38.54,00:02:38.54,"Look, I'm not really sure thatyou're not going to vote me out"
52,00:02:41.04,00:02:41.04,"as soon as you get your nextopportunity, and I don't want to"
53,00:02:43.83,00:02:43.83,feel that way about somebody whoI'm planning on going to
54,00:02:46.00,00:02:46.00,the final six with.>> I guess what we're
55,00:02:47.58,00:02:47.58,wondering is...>> Will I sell you out sooner?
56,00:02:49.50,00:02:49.50,"Is that what you're asking me?>> Yeah, basically."
57,00:02:52.04,00:02:52.04,>> No. Right now they have me intheir alliance of six.
58,00:02:54.42,00:02:54.42,"They may think they have allthe power, but I'm feeling like"
59,00:02:58.08,00:02:58.08,my goal is that I have thepower.

65,00:04:21.88,00:04:21.88,>> No worries.>> That was a textbook blindside
66,00:04:23.54,00:04:23.54,to Ace.So I'm so glad that I stuck to
67,00:04:27.75,00:04:27.75,my promise and didn't vote himout.
68,00:04:31.33,00:04:31.33,But I'm not gonna cornermyself with any pacts on my
69,00:04:33.83,00:04:33.83,girlfriend again.Ace told me he had you in his

74,00:04:44.04,00:04:44.04,you.>> I trust Kenny a lot more
75,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,than I trust Ace.And Kenny's completely honest
76,00:04:49.04,00:04:49.04,with me and told me that Acehas been trying to throw me
77,00:04:51.46,00:04:51.46,"under the bus, so I figured I'dbetter take him out as soon as"
78,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,I can.>> You're gonna be gunning
79,00:04:57.08,00:04:57.08,"for me now, Crystal.>> No, she's not."
80,00:04:59.00,00:04:59.00,">> Dude, that is... that's done.I mean, I'm looking at you in"

83,00:05:06.12,00:05:06.12,">> Don't let anybody else...>> Yeah, don't let anybody else"
84,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,get in your head.>> I'm a little concerned that
85,00:05:11.38,00:05:11.38,"Crystal's upset with me,because I voted for Crystal."
86,00:05:14.25,00:05:14.25,I had no options.I-I couldn't break that promise
87,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,to Ace.I'm just praying for a merge
88,00:05:19.29,00:05:19.29,"and I'm praying for this gameto change and if it doesn't,"
89,00:05:21.92,00:05:21.92,"I'm in deep trouble.>> Guys, I have a plan for the"
90,00:05:30.67,00:05:30.67,merge tomorrow.>> I hope there's a merge.

99,00:05:56.88,00:05:56.88,we can go as far as possible.>> You guys are all survivors.
100,00:06:00.54,00:06:00.54,>> Welcome to the game.(laughs)

189,00:10:34.21,00:10:34.21,immediately and became thechampion of this idea.
190,00:10:37.04,00:10:37.04,>> Anybody opposed to findingthe idol and setting it adrift?
191,00:10:40.33,00:10:40.33,Sending it to the ocean gods?>> I think that'd be cool.

373,00:20:54.29,00:20:54.29,It's just you or I.>> You're right.
374,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,>> We have to keep our eyes andears open.
375,00:20:57.54,00:20:57.54,"So, if I hear that you're goingto be voted out..."
376,00:20:59.21,00:20:59.21,>> Yeah?>> You've got to use the idol.
377,00:21:01.21,00:21:01.21,>> I know.>> If you're gonna hear that I'm
378,00:21:02.71,00:21:02.71,"going to get voted out, yougotta tell me so I can try to"
379,00:21:05.21,00:21:05.21,maneuver something.Me and Sugar have each other's
380,00:21:06.96,00:21:06.96,"back and she has the idol.So, I think we can help each"
381,00:21:09.25,00:21:09.25,other.>> Were you trying to bring this
382,00:21:21.75,00:21:21.75,"back?>> Yeah, I have."
383,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,I've brought some big logs back.I just...
384,00:21:25.79,00:21:25.79,"I might have to break this up.Hey, you know what?"
385,00:21:27.96,00:21:27.96,It might be easier to pull itup that way and then take it
386,00:21:30.00,00:21:30.00,out.>> We have a powerful pact to
387,00:21:34.29,00:21:34.29,get us to the final six withouteven batting an eyelash.
388,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,The way things divided up isperfect.
389,00:21:40.71,00:21:40.71,">> And theoretically, like,nothing should change."
390,00:21:43.04,00:21:43.04,Bob gives me a lot ofconfidence that he's not going
391,00:21:45.42,00:21:45.42,to budge on the situation.But Susie always made me a bit
392,00:21:48.46,00:21:48.46,"nervous.I think, given the opportunity,"
393,00:21:51.50,00:21:51.50,she would sell me down theriver in a second.
394,00:21:57.71,00:21:57.71,">> We have numbers on bothsides, kind of, right now."
395,00:22:00.17,00:22:00.17,Let's say for some reason welost.
396,00:22:02.83,00:22:02.83,I can make a decision to go oneway or the other.
397,00:22:05.79,00:22:05.79,>> I am far more paranoid thanI have been in this game.
398,00:22:09.12,00:22:09.12,Kenny and Crystal are supertight and Bob and I are super
399,00:22:11.71,00:22:11.71,"tight here and Susie's in themiddle, spinning around in"
400,00:22:14.75,00:22:14.75,"circles, playing dizzy bat.And where is she going to stop?"
401,00:22:17.38,00:22:17.38,I have no idea.>> We can make it to the top
402,00:22:19.67,00:22:19.67,"six. That's our goal, right? >> Yeah."
403,00:22:21.12,00:22:21.12,"But then, when we're there,where does that put me, then?"
404,00:22:23.12,00:22:23.12,'Cause I am one of the weakerpeople. Is that gonna...
405,00:22:24.71,00:22:24.71,Am I always going to be sixth?Because think about it.
406,00:22:28.54,00:22:28.54,"It's one thing to be in the topsix, but I need to be in the"
407,00:22:30.62,00:22:30.62,"top three.Marcus is basically the king,"
408,00:22:35.04,00:22:35.04,but I have the power right nowto just cut his head off.
409,00:22:38.17,00:22:38.17,"If I do switch, it's his ownfault because he didn't give me"
410,00:22:40.67,00:22:40.67,a clear statement.(snorting)
411,00:23:04.04,00:23:04.04,>> We got mail!>> I just think...
412,00:23:08.92,00:23:08.92,"Can you imagine a better...I mean, three and three?"
413,00:23:11.92,00:23:11.92,>> It's perfect.>> My only concern is that that
414,00:23:13.79,00:23:13.79,crazy bitch Susie could flip toget rid of Bob and Marcus.
415,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17,">> And that is a ""save Marcus""move more than anything."
416,00:23:24.88,00:23:24.88,"And then, then it doesn't reallymatter what crazy Susie does."
417,00:23:28.79,00:23:28.79,>> Right.I was very pleased with the
418,00:23:30.12,00:23:30.12,conversation I had with Randythis morning just regarding
419,00:23:32.54,00:23:32.54,"Matty, because we need to getrid of him first if we have to"
420,00:23:35.38,00:23:35.38,"go to Tribal, and, like, hetotally is on board."
421,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,"100%.>> If we have to go, as much as"
422,00:23:41.25,00:23:41.25,"I'd hate to do it, we'd have totake out Matty."
423,00:23:44.12,00:23:44.12,>> Yeah.>> Just because of the idol.
424,00:23:46.17,00:23:46.17,"There is a one in a billionchance that Sugar is, like, a"
425,00:23:50.58,00:23:50.58,rocket scientist and she'shiding the idol.
426,00:23:53.04,00:23:53.04,"I'd like to see Matty stayaround, but keeping Charlie and"
427,00:23:57.33,00:23:57.33,Corinne happy is more importantthan keeping Matty happy.
428,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,">> Hey, we got mail!""If you can't keep it up, there"
429,00:24:04.25,00:24:04.25,is reason to worry.You may be the first to join
430,00:24:07.12,00:24:07.12,"the jury."">> If we can't keep it up? Up."
431,00:24:09.29,00:24:09.29,Something in the air.>> You've seen the challenges
432,00:24:11.00,00:24:11.00,where your wrist is likestrapped to a huge bucket of
433,00:24:13.33,00:24:13.33,water?>> Oh!
434,00:24:14.92,00:24:14.92,">> At this point in the game,I'm very concerned about my"
435,00:24:17.29,00:24:17.29,"time here, and I don't know howmuch I have left."
436,00:24:20.46,00:24:20.46,Every moment seems to be prettyvaluable.
437,00:24:23.21,00:24:23.21,So today I'm going to give itmy all.

442,00:24:52.83,00:24:52.83,">> Uh, yeah, I threw away mygame plan the minute I saw that"
443,00:24:56.62,00:24:56.62,box open up and reached in andpulled a number out.
444,00:24:59.08,00:24:59.08,">> PROBST: Corinne, happy withthe new tribe division?"

448,00:25:07.04,00:25:07.04,"'cause ""Fang"" has such a badconnotation."

450,00:25:12.42,00:25:12.42,"is it hard to hear Corinnesay, ""We don't even say 'Fang'"

459,00:25:39.83,00:25:39.83,"With your arms outstretched,you will use the tops of your"

559,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,"super honest if you can do it ornot-- would be, like, I hate to"
560,00:32:23.00,00:32:23.00,"say it, but like, if Ken goeshome tonight then we're good."
561,00:32:27.54,00:32:27.54,And then that gives us a shoe infor who goes next.
562,00:32:30.29,00:32:30.29,"Like, it's obviously going tobe Susie."
563,00:32:32.54,00:32:32.54,"That's, that's a no-brainerfor me."
564,00:32:35.33,00:32:35.33,"But the hope is that you're nowpart of the Kota Six, instead of"
565,00:32:38.38,00:32:38.38,"Susie. It just...>> Well, can you sell 'em on it?"
566,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,">> Yeah, because Corinne can'tstand Susie."
567,00:32:44.83,00:32:44.83,"Randy, you know can't standSusie and frankly, Crystal,"
568,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,the benefit of you screwing upin challenges is that...
569,00:32:53.46,00:32:53.46,">> Right now, I am batting zero.>> I hate to do this."
570,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,">> Marcus and I now have asolid relationship, but when you"
571,00:33:06.79,00:33:06.79,start talking about knockingoff my number-one ally just so
572,00:33:10.71,00:33:10.71,"you can get further in thegame, I'm not pleased. At all."
573,00:33:15.25,00:33:15.25,>> I know you told me yesterdayyou weren't writing my name
574,00:33:16.96,00:33:16.96,down.>> No.
575,00:33:18.38,00:33:18.38,>> I'm telling you that I'm notwriting your name down tonight.
576,00:33:20.29,00:33:20.29,">> Marcus is playing the niceguy, but he's a schemer."
577,00:33:23.58,00:33:23.58,"I'm playing nice girl, liarand schemer."
578,00:33:27.75,00:33:27.75,"The game is outwit, outlast andyou can't outwit Crystal Cox,"
579,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,baby.>> I'm thinking that the least
580,00:33:36.88,00:33:36.88,threatening person is Crystal.She's not going to beat us.
581,00:33:40.25,00:33:40.25,"I mean, she has not run faster,she cannot swim, she can't"
582,00:33:42.71,00:33:42.71,balance.She can't even do the hand
583,00:33:44.25,00:33:44.25,"thing.>> Yeah, she had a hard time"
584,00:33:45.92,00:33:45.92,"with that.>> So, let's minimize our risk"
585,00:33:47.33,00:33:47.33,of somebody getting immunity.>> I said we should take
586,00:33:50.21,00:33:50.21,Crystal out first because shemay do better now that she's
587,00:33:52.75,00:33:52.75,"eating.>> Yeah, but you..."
588,00:33:54.17,00:33:54.17,">> But then at the same time...>> Bob beat her, I beat her..."
589,00:33:56.12,00:33:56.12,"Like, she couldn't even hold--You beat her. She's atrocious."
590,00:33:58.50,00:33:58.50,">> Yeah, yeah.>> My thought was tonight Ken"
591,00:34:00.88,00:34:00.88,and then hopefully we don'thave to go for a while but then
592,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,Crystal would be next.>> Marcus has a lot of control
593,00:34:07.21,00:34:07.21,of who should be voted off andBob's just going to follow
594,00:34:09.83,00:34:09.83,whatever he says.I feel safer at this point
595,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,to stay with Marcus in whichway we're going to vote.
596,00:34:16.08,00:34:16.08,"Right now I'm actually puttingtrust in you, and that's huge."
597,00:34:19.00,00:34:19.00,>> I thought we've been doingthat for a while at this point.
598,00:34:21.42,00:34:21.42,">> Yeah, I know.And my guarantee is that you "
599,00:34:24.25,00:34:24.25,"will help me get there.>> Once we get there, let's say"
600,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,that you got Matty and Randythere.
601,00:34:29.29,00:34:29.29,>> Then it's just...But everybody knows Matty's a
602,00:34:32.62,00:34:32.62,"threat so, Matty's gonna gofirst and then Randy and Bob"
603,00:34:36.04,00:34:36.04,and then Corinne...>> I'm good with that.
604,00:34:39.54,00:34:39.54,">> So, that makes the mostsense."
605,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,>> Okay.>> I feel like I can use Marcus
606,00:34:44.25,00:34:44.25,to get me at least to the topthree so I have a chance at one.
607,00:34:47.38,00:34:47.38,That's how I look at it.>> Yeah.
608,00:34:57.75,00:34:57.75,>> Okay.>> Okay.
609,00:34:59.29,00:34:59.29,Susie will either go with us orshe gets voted off tonight.
610,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,That's... that's...What do you mean no?
611,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,What do you mean?>> Really?
612,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,>> Yes.I can't let them do it.
613,00:35:16.33,00:35:16.33,>> Marcus told you that hewanted to write my name down?
614,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,">> Yes.And I'm not writing your name,"
615,00:35:23.25,00:35:23.25,Kenny.>> Kenny being safe tonight is
616,00:35:29.58,00:35:29.58,riding 100% on Sue.Or else Kenny goes home.
617,00:35:37.67,00:35:37.67,">> Did you clean the fish, Bob?>> What's that?"
618,00:35:39.12,00:35:39.12,">> You clean the fish?>> Yeah, I got it all right."
619,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,>> Almost ready to eat.>> I don't feel super
620,00:36:24.38,00:36:24.38,comfortable if I was to votewith Crystal and Kenny and
621,00:36:27.62,00:36:27.62,vote off Marcus.'Cause I don't know if Crystal
622,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,and Kenny could help me get tothe top three.
623,00:36:36.46,00:36:36.46,">> Susie, Susie...Okay?"
624,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,>> Okay.I have a huge decision to
625,00:36:43.62,00:36:43.62,make tonight in which way to go.Either Marcus or Bob or I can
626,00:36:46.92,00:36:46.92,vote with Kenny and Crystal.I don't know if it's good or
627,00:36:49.75,00:36:49.75,bad.I'm confused and I just don't
628,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,know.I don't know how to feel about
629,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,it right now.It's scary and that's the truth.
630,00:37:21.62,00:37:21.62,">> PROBST: So, Crystal, you andKenny had not spent any time"
631,00:37:24.62,00:37:24.62,with Kota.What's it like?
632,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,">> To me, the Kota camp is likecorporate espionage."
633,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,"You wear the suit, but what'sgoing on in your head?"
634,00:37:34.29,00:37:34.29,"Whereas at Fang, this is theprojects, I'm eating some rice,"
635,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,"we're hungry, let's go to war.And over there it's like ""I wear"
636,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,"my suit."">> PROBST: So, Bob, now that a"
637,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,"merge maybe isn't around thecorner, does it change your"
638,00:37:47.96,00:37:47.96,strategy?>> Yes.
639,00:37:49.75,00:37:49.75,Last time I was here one of thereasons I made the decision I
640,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,made was I thought a merge wasimminent.
641,00:37:55.38,00:37:55.38,"I made a mistake.>> PROBST: So, you're saying you"
642,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,regret your last vote?>> Had I known it was going to
643,00:38:00.88,00:38:00.88,"go this way, yes, I might havedone something differently."
644,00:38:04.00,00:38:04.00,">> PROBST: So, Marcus, is itimportant to keep this tribe"
645,00:38:06.29,00:38:06.29,physically strong to winchallenges or that I hang on to
646,00:38:09.58,00:38:09.58,this alliance and hope that amerge is coming?
647,00:38:12.12,00:38:12.12,>> I think it's important tokeep the tribe physically
648,00:38:14.33,00:38:14.33,strong and ready for challenges.My hope is to keep us as strong
649,00:38:17.92,00:38:17.92,"as we can.>> I think that's total bull,"
650,00:38:20.25,00:38:20.25,what he just said in his mouth.He's definitely looking for a
651,00:38:23.12,00:38:23.12,merge around the corner andhave numbers to take out Fang.
652,00:38:26.12,00:38:26.12,"Is it not a strategy, Marcus,to vote out Fang?"
653,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,>> You know very well that webeat you guys seven times in a
654,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,row and why would we want tochange any of the people in
655,00:38:34.12,00:38:34.12,"there?Frankly, I think you're really"
656,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,a nice guy and it sucksthat your frustration is being
657,00:38:38.12,00:38:38.12,"taken out in this direction, youknow?"
658,00:38:40.38,00:38:40.38,>> But I feel that you are theleader of Kota and that you
659,00:38:44.00,00:38:44.00,are the special Kota guy thateverybody's listening to to
660,00:38:47.38,00:38:47.38,vote somebody off.>> I'm one of the five opinions
661,00:38:49.92,00:38:49.92,here and we don't see who wevote for until the final vote
662,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,"is called, so...>> PROBST: So, Bob, getting to"

671,00:39:49.21,00:39:49.21,tonight makes it a little biteasier.
672,00:39:58.29,00:39:58.29,>> You like comics when thelittle guy takes out the big guy
673,00:40:00.92,00:40:00.92,"or the bully?Well, hopefully that happens"
674,00:40:03.71,00:40:03.71,tonight.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
