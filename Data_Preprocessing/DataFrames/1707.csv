2,00:00:02.12,00:00:02.12,Survivor: The Kota tribe has enjoyed
3,00:00:05.38,00:00:05.38,the benefits of winning a staggering nine out of 11
4,00:00:08.21,00:00:08.21,"challenges against the rapidly dwindling Fang tribe, but on day"
5,00:00:12.96,00:00:12.96,21 both tribes competed for individual immunity.
6,00:00:17.00,00:00:17.00,Ace in the water first! Marcus wins individual immunity!
7,00:00:20.46,00:00:20.46,And both tribes were sent to Tribal Council.
8,00:00:24.00,00:00:24.00,"At the Kota Tribal Council, Susie dissed Corinne..."
9,00:00:27.21,00:00:27.21,>> I think I'm stronger than Corinne.
10,00:00:29.00,00:00:29.00,>> PROBST: Corinne not buying that at all.
11,00:00:30.75,00:00:30.75,...and narrowly avoided getting voted out.
12,00:00:32.79,00:00:32.79,"We're tied, three votes Susie, three votes Dan, one vote left."
13,00:00:36.71,00:00:36.71,That honor went to Dan. The tribe has spoken.
14,00:00:42.25,00:00:42.25,"At the Fang Tribal Council, Sugar surprised everyone by"
15,00:00:45.17,00:00:45.17,stabbing her closest ally in the back.
16,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,"With physical force Ace out of the game, Fang needs a miracle"
17,00:00:52.58,00:00:52.58,to turn things around. Ten are left.
18,00:00:55.29,00:00:55.29,Who will be voted out tonight? >> What's so funny?
19,00:01:05.00,00:01:05.00,>> How was that compared to the other Tribal Councils you had?
20,00:01:08.46,00:01:08.46,">> Uh, the other ones are easy. (laughter)"
21,00:01:12.75,00:01:12.75,"That wasn't meant to be funny. >> No. Yeah, it was tough."
22,00:01:16.88,00:01:16.88,">> Yeah, I mean, I didn't say it to get people to laugh."
23,00:01:19.67,00:01:19.67,Tonight was not fun. That was my friend that left.
24,00:01:21.46,00:01:21.46,">> Yeah. >> You know, think about what I"
25,00:01:24.42,00:01:24.42,"say before you just instantly start laughing, 'cause not all"
26,00:01:28.04,00:01:28.04,the time I'm trying to be funny. We voted Dan off tonight.
27,00:01:32.29,00:01:32.29,"Uh, the vote was 4-3. I voted for Susie just in case"
28,00:01:36.42,00:01:36.42,Dan had the hidden immunity idol and could have taken
29,00:01:39.08,00:01:39.08,"anybody he wanted out. He was my friend, but he had to"
30,00:01:43.38,00:01:43.38,go. >> I would like to analyze
31,00:01:46.08,00:01:46.08,what our weaknesses are and shore 'em up.
32,00:01:48.17,00:01:48.17,Because I personally feel like the merge is coming in the next
33,00:01:51.42,00:01:51.42,"couple days. >> Well, and the way I look at"
34,00:01:54.62,00:01:54.62,"it, operation clean sweep; these six mowing down that four."
35,00:01:58.17,00:01:58.17,"You know, this is the heart of who's left, the six of us."
36,00:02:01.46,00:02:01.46,>> Let's do it. >> We can make it happen.
37,00:02:04.12,00:02:04.12,">> We can't, like... I mean, I'm not trying to call you out,"
38,00:02:07.17,00:02:07.17,"particularly Susie, but like you can't threaten to vote for"
39,00:02:09.46,00:02:09.46,Corinne and not tell somebody that there is a problem there.
40,00:02:11.92,00:02:11.92,>> Yeah. When you and I had the conversation and you said I
41,00:02:14.50,00:02:14.50,"wasn't helpful around camp, you know, I understood that."
42,00:02:16.67,00:02:16.67,I'm sensitive to it now. But what I don't understand is
43,00:02:19.38,00:02:19.38,"during Tribal you had, like, a lot of other gripes."
44,00:02:21.50,00:02:21.50,"Prior to going in, Susie told me that she was gonna vote for"
45,00:02:24.17,00:02:24.17,me based on the fact that she did not think I did enough work
46,00:02:26.92,00:02:26.92,"around camp. Well, then we get to Tribal."
47,00:02:29.25,00:02:29.25,Who's the weakest player in the game?
48,00:02:31.12,00:02:31.12,I think Corinne's weaker than me.
49,00:02:33.04,00:02:33.04,"I think I swim better than Corinne, I think I have"
50,00:02:34.71,00:02:34.71,better upper-body strength. The woman is 47 years old.
51,00:02:36.42,00:02:36.42,What could she possibly have over me?
52,00:02:38.54,00:02:38.54,"Look, I'm not really sure that you're not going to vote me out"
53,00:02:41.04,00:02:41.04,"as soon as you get your next opportunity, and I don't want to"
54,00:02:43.83,00:02:43.83,feel that way about somebody who I'm planning on going to
55,00:02:46.00,00:02:46.00,the final six with. >> I guess what we're
56,00:02:47.58,00:02:47.58,wondering is... >> Will I sell you out sooner?
57,00:02:49.50,00:02:49.50,"Is that what you're asking me? >> Yeah, basically."
58,00:02:52.04,00:02:52.04,>> No. Right now they have me in their alliance of six.
59,00:02:54.42,00:02:54.42,"They may think they have all the power, but I'm feeling like"
60,00:02:58.08,00:02:58.08,my goal is that I have the power.

63,00:04:05.58,00:04:05.58,"(man groans) >> How gnarly was that, dude?"
64,00:04:13.83,00:04:13.83,>> We can make a fire and... >> That was crazy.
65,00:04:19.88,00:04:19.88,>> Sorry to surprise you like that.
66,00:04:21.88,00:04:21.88,>> No worries. >> That was a textbook blindside
67,00:04:23.54,00:04:23.54,to Ace. So I'm so glad that I stuck to
68,00:04:27.75,00:04:27.75,my promise and didn't vote him out.
69,00:04:31.33,00:04:31.33,But I'm not gonna corner myself with any pacts on my
70,00:04:33.83,00:04:33.83,girlfriend again. Ace told me he had you in his
71,00:04:36.08,00:04:36.08,"back pocket, like you guys are friends, buddy buddy."
72,00:04:37.67,00:04:37.67,">> Yeah, that's exactly what he thought."
73,00:04:39.38,00:04:39.38,">> As far as I know, Ace was totally like your..."
74,00:04:42.04,00:04:42.04,">> He was playing you, Matty. >> Okay, well, he was playing"
75,00:04:44.04,00:04:44.04,you. >> I trust Kenny a lot more
76,00:04:46.25,00:04:46.25,than I trust Ace. And Kenny's completely honest
77,00:04:49.04,00:04:49.04,with me and told me that Ace has been trying to throw me
78,00:04:51.46,00:04:51.46,"under the bus, so I figured I'd better take him out as soon as"
79,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,I can. >> You're gonna be gunning
80,00:04:57.08,00:04:57.08,"for me now, Crystal. >> No, she's not."
81,00:04:59.00,00:04:59.00,">> Dude, that is... that's done. I mean, I'm looking at you in"
82,00:05:01.38,00:05:01.38,"the whatever light we have, Matty."
83,00:05:03.42,00:05:03.42,"If you want to start from a clean slate, we can."
84,00:05:06.12,00:05:06.12,">> Don't let anybody else... >> Yeah, don't let anybody else"
85,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,get in your head. >> I'm a little concerned that
86,00:05:11.38,00:05:11.38,"Crystal's upset with me, because I voted for Crystal."
87,00:05:14.25,00:05:14.25,I had no options. I-I couldn't break that promise
88,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,to Ace. I'm just praying for a merge
89,00:05:19.29,00:05:19.29,"and I'm praying for this game to change and if it doesn't,"
90,00:05:21.92,00:05:21.92,"I'm in deep trouble. >> Guys, I have a plan for the"
91,00:05:30.67,00:05:30.67,merge tomorrow. >> I hope there's a merge.
92,00:05:32.88,00:05:32.88,">> We are going to be the final four, us four right here."
93,00:05:35.88,00:05:35.88,Sugar does have the idol. >> You guys cannot tell them
94,00:05:39.75,00:05:39.75,"that I still have it. >> Yeah, okay."
95,00:05:41.54,00:05:41.54,>> Nobody will know you have the idol.
96,00:05:43.21,00:05:43.21,>> Cool. We're good. We're starting over.
97,00:05:45.25,00:05:45.25,">> Hopes are high right now for the current Fang members, and if"
98,00:05:48.08,00:05:48.08,"there's going to be a merge, hopefully we can outwit,"
99,00:05:51.88,00:05:51.88,outlast and outplay the current remaining Kota members so that
100,00:05:56.88,00:05:56.88,we can go as far as possible. >> You guys are all survivors.
101,00:06:00.54,00:06:00.54,>> Welcome to the game. (laughs)
102,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,(growling) >> Not only did I go above and
103,00:06:15.12,00:06:15.12,"beyond to be extra nice to Susie, I understood that she"
104,00:06:17.12,00:06:17.12,thought I didn't do much around camp.
105,00:06:19.08,00:06:19.08,"Then we got to Tribal and she, like, whips out all"
106,00:06:21.17,00:06:21.17,"this other stuff. I was, like, highly annoyed with"
107,00:06:22.96,00:06:22.96,it. >> Uh-oh.
108,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17,">> Oh... Ooh. Oh, it's a spoon."
109,00:06:29.25,00:06:29.25,"After what Susie said at last night's Tribal, I plan on"
110,00:06:31.96,00:06:31.96,"burying her as soon as possible, alive."
111,00:06:35.67,00:06:35.67,"I am an extremely vindictive person, and I will get my"
112,00:06:37.79,00:06:37.79,revenge. >> Here they come.
113,00:06:39.79,00:06:39.79,">> Tree mail. ""For a feast that will be"
114,00:06:43.12,00:06:43.12,"catered and enjoyed under the sun, it's time to party on the"
115,00:06:48.12,00:06:48.12,"equator like a beach bash, so have some fun."""
116,00:06:51.25,00:06:51.25,">> Wait, there's more. ""Take only your personal"
117,00:06:53.42,00:06:53.42,possessions. All you need awaits
118,00:06:56.21,00:06:56.21,"your arrival, a brand-new tribe, a brand-new game, a"
119,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,"new way of survival."" >> Whoo!"
120,00:07:02.04,00:07:02.04,>> Is this my personal possession? 
121,00:07:04.04,00:07:04.04,">> This is mine. >> We got a beach, and there's"
122,00:07:06.04,00:07:06.04,"food! >> Tree mail's got ""merge"""
123,00:07:07.96,00:07:07.96,written all over it. It's talking about a feast.
124,00:07:10.92,00:07:10.92,"It's talking about fun, and most importantly it's talking about"
125,00:07:13.46,00:07:13.46,moving to the beach. >> We're going to the equator.
126,00:07:16.58,00:07:16.58,">> All I want to say is Kota six, and that's all that needs"
127,00:07:19.58,00:07:19.58,to be said on that. And don't be fooled.
128,00:07:22.17,00:07:22.17,"New tribe of the ten of us remaining, Kota Six to the end,"
129,00:07:26.00,00:07:26.00,"Fang four, good-bye. >> Oh, wow!"
130,00:07:40.62,00:07:40.62,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God!"
131,00:07:42.04,00:07:42.04,">> Oh, my God! >> There's mixed nuts!"
132,00:07:44.88,00:07:44.88,>> Oh! >> Hi!
133,00:07:52.75,00:07:52.75,>> My heart was pounding 'cause I couldn't tell you the
134,00:07:55.33,00:07:55.33,feeling that seeing an endless amount of food.
135,00:07:58.75,00:07:58.75,"It was, like, it was so nice. It was so nice."
136,00:08:02.88,00:08:02.88,"It was unforgettable. It says ""Open only after you"
137,00:08:06.38,00:08:06.38,"have finished enjoying your feast, as once this box is"
138,00:08:09.08,00:08:09.08,"opened, the feast is over."" >> We're not opening that until"
139,00:08:12.00,00:08:12.00,"this is depleted. >> Guys, we're gonna be here"
140,00:08:14.96,00:08:14.96,all afternoon. The meatloaf?
141,00:08:20.17,00:08:20.17,>> I gotta remember to swallow. >> Stay away from the box.
142,00:08:23.92,00:08:23.92,">> There's a big box that says, ""Do not open until everybody's"
143,00:08:27.25,00:08:27.25,"done eating."" And I don't know what's in the"
144,00:08:29.17,00:08:29.17,box. I know whatever it is it ends
145,00:08:32.21,00:08:32.21,"the fun and it starts the game play again, and I am going to"
146,00:08:37.25,00:08:37.25,prolong that as long as I can. >> This meatloaf tastes so good!
147,00:08:41.12,00:08:41.12,">> Chow down! >> Kenny, no need to speak,"
148,00:08:45.96,00:08:45.96,"just eat, dude. >> Oh, sweet."
149,00:08:48.04,00:08:48.04,>> Does anyone want me to pour them a glass of white wine?
150,00:08:50.21,00:08:50.21,">> Matty, could you hook me up? >> I would love red wine."
151,00:08:52.54,00:08:52.54,">> There's, like, juice. >> There's two bottles of wine"
152,00:08:54.17,00:08:54.17,right there. >> Yeah.
153,00:09:01.42,00:09:01.42,">> Oh, my God. >> I saw the hidden immunity"
154,00:09:05.25,00:09:05.25,idol note under the table. And the idol was more
155,00:09:07.12,00:09:07.12,tempting than the food. >> What's that clue...? Is that
156,00:09:09.92,00:09:09.92,"something you guys brought? >> Yeah, let's see what it says."
157,00:09:12.21,00:09:12.21,>> I was trying to read it to see what it was.
158,00:09:14.38,00:09:14.38,And by then Charlie already looked over and started reading
159,00:09:16.67,00:09:16.67,"it, too. >> Read it out loud."
160,00:09:18.12,00:09:18.12,">> And then, I read it and it said ""You can either share it or"
161,00:09:21.25,00:09:21.25,"keep it to yourself."" And I wanted to keep it to"
162,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,myself. >> Put it down until we eat.
163,00:09:24.79,00:09:24.79,Just-just cover it and we'll read it...
164,00:09:26.29,00:09:26.29,>> I want to eat. >> Let's live in the moment
165,00:09:28.08,00:09:28.08,"right now. >> And then I was like, ""Okay, I"
166,00:09:30.12,00:09:30.12,"guess my cover is blown."" >> Guys, I feel bad not sharing"
167,00:09:32.67,00:09:32.67,this because I saw the whole thing.
168,00:09:34.12,00:09:34.12,"So I feel like you guys should take a look, too."
169,00:09:36.67,00:09:36.67,>> What does it say? >> It's about the immunity idol.
170,00:09:39.04,00:09:39.04,">> Damn it, damn it, there's my chance to find the hidden"
171,00:09:41.50,00:09:41.50,"immunity idol for myself, and Charlie blew it for me."
172,00:09:44.42,00:09:44.42,">> ""You have just discovered a clue to another hidden immunity"
173,00:09:47.46,00:09:47.46,idol. You can keep it a secret or
174,00:09:49.17,00:09:49.17,"share. Either way, you must find it"
175,00:09:51.38,00:09:51.38,before your day at the beach is over.
176,00:09:53.38,00:09:53.38,On the sand lies a large dead log cradled in the crook of a
177,00:09:56.58,00:09:56.58,tree. Beneath the end of the tree's
178,00:09:58.96,00:09:58.96,"lowest limb you can dig for immunity."""
179,00:10:01.58,00:10:01.58,>> Who wants it? I see it. >> It's whoever decides to get
180,00:10:04.21,00:10:04.21,up and finish eating. >> It's right over my right
181,00:10:06.21,00:10:06.21,shoulder. >> I like that idea. I would...
182,00:10:12.33,00:10:12.33,>> That's a good idea. >> It occurred to me that if
183,00:10:14.75,00:10:14.75,everyone's gonna act so casual about not really wanting an
184,00:10:18.04,00:10:18.04,"immunity idol that's hidden just a few feet away from the table,"
185,00:10:21.21,00:10:21.21,"then fine, I'll call all of your bluffs... and I will force you"
186,00:10:25.08,00:10:25.08,"to get rid of it. What do you say we find it and,"
187,00:10:28.12,00:10:28.12,"as a group, set it sail? >> Yeah, yeah, set it free."
188,00:10:30.17,00:10:30.17,>> That's a great idea. >> We don't need no stinkin'
189,00:10:32.50,00:10:32.50,idol. >> Randy caught my drift
190,00:10:34.21,00:10:34.21,immediately and became the champion of this idea.
191,00:10:37.04,00:10:37.04,>> Anybody opposed to finding the idol and setting it adrift?
192,00:10:40.33,00:10:40.33,Sending it to the ocean gods? >> I think that'd be cool.
193,00:10:43.00,00:10:43.00,>> Let's go. >> All right.
194,00:10:44.58,00:10:44.58,">> I'm gonna start off shirtless-- if we get naked,"
195,00:10:46.83,00:10:46.83,then so be it. I didn't even need to see a
196,00:10:49.00,00:10:49.00,note. I knew that the weird-shaped
197,00:10:51.33,00:10:51.33,tree on the beach was significant.
198,00:10:53.96,00:10:53.96,"It was, like, pointing into the sand, and I'm, like, ""How"
199,00:10:56.12,00:10:56.12,"obvious."" >> What about over there?"
200,00:11:00.17,00:11:00.17,">> I told you I would in less than a minute, and it took two"
201,00:11:02.33,00:11:02.33,"seconds. >> Yeah, Randy!"
202,00:11:04.21,00:11:04.21,">> I'm sorry if I'm sounding arrogant, but it was a joke."
203,00:11:06.79,00:11:06.79,I gave myself 20 seconds. I think I took seven.
204,00:11:09.88,00:11:09.88,"I'm king of Gabon. >> That's your boasting rights,"
205,00:11:13.25,00:11:13.25,my friend. >> That's right.
206,00:11:14.67,00:11:14.67,>> I'll say it loud and proud. Congratulations for your quick
207,00:11:17.54,00:11:17.54,"wit and mind. >> I found it, and, uh, I don't"
208,00:11:20.96,00:11:20.96,"want it, and if anybody else wants it, by all means, take it."
209,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,">> You touch that, it's ""good game"" for you."
210,00:11:28.50,00:11:28.50,Immunity-- the most important thing in this game.
211,00:11:30.96,00:11:30.96,"But if I were to take it, then I'd look like a snake."
212,00:11:34.00,00:11:34.00,I can't take that chance. >> It's the apple in the Garden
213,00:11:36.88,00:11:36.88,"of Eden. >> Yeah, you want the apple,"
214,00:11:38.46,00:11:38.46,"take it, but... no. >> You want the apple, Matty."
215,00:11:43.58,00:11:43.58,">> Crystal? >> No, don't touch it, dawg."
216,00:11:45.04,00:11:45.04,>> Don't touch it. >> I wanted that immunity idol.
217,00:11:47.67,00:11:47.67,I'm not even gonna sit here and lie.
218,00:11:50.08,00:11:50.08,"I wanted that immunity idol, because that's pretty much your"
219,00:11:53.92,00:11:53.92,"protection in the game. >> It was the apple in Eden, and"
220,00:11:58.75,00:11:58.75,"that idol represented the apple in Eden, and if you grab that"
221,00:12:02.96,00:12:02.96,"idol, you are biting into the apple and you'd be exiled from"
222,00:12:06.21,00:12:06.21,"Eden. >> Matty, you're thinking too"
223,00:12:08.17,00:12:08.17,long. >> I'm not gonna do it.
224,00:12:09.83,00:12:09.83,And nobody wants to be thrown out of Eden.
225,00:12:13.08,00:12:13.08,(several talking at once) >> Just to tie it to the...
226,00:12:16.38,00:12:16.38,">> You sure? >> Yeah, 'cause of the sand."
227,00:12:18.46,00:12:18.46,">> All right, guys, all of us to the beach."
228,00:12:27.12,00:12:27.12,">> With all due respect to President Bongo, I am the new"
229,00:12:29.71,00:12:29.71,"king of Gabon. I'm sorry, but I rule."
230,00:12:32.79,00:12:32.79,"This ocean, it's mine. One last time-- anybody who"
231,00:12:36.83,00:12:36.83,"wants immunity, it's theirs. >> Oh, my God."
232,00:12:39.25,00:12:39.25,>> Who wants it? >> The ocean wants it.
233,00:12:42.17,00:12:42.17,">> The ocean! All those Fang, Kota members,"
234,00:12:46.42,00:12:46.42,they work for me. I'm king. Cheers.
235,00:12:56.54,00:12:56.54,(whooping) >> These people are so stupid.
236,00:13:00.88,00:13:00.88,I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean.
237,00:13:06.79,00:13:06.79,It's never been done. It was a perfect way to make the
238,00:13:10.08,00:13:10.08,situation much easier for the Kota Six to gain control of the
239,00:13:14.50,00:13:14.50,"game, because there's no extra idol floating around to really"
240,00:13:17.96,00:13:17.96,screw up any votes. >> Throwing the immunity idol
241,00:13:21.12,00:13:21.12,"out to sea, yeah, it was a beautiful, lovely thought and"
242,00:13:23.96,00:13:23.96,"everything, but that is a very prized possession in this game,"
243,00:13:27.79,00:13:27.79,"and luckily, I have one. (laughter)"
244,00:13:31.29,00:13:31.29,>> You guys want me to read it? >> Yeah.
245,00:13:34.46,00:13:34.46,">> Oh, it's open. >> It says: ""Note number one."""
246,00:13:38.00,00:13:38.00,">> ""Note number one."" >> Here we go."
247,00:13:40.12,00:13:40.12,">> ""In this bag, there are ten numbered stones."
248,00:13:44.54,00:13:44.54,"Without looking, each tribe member will grab a stone."
249,00:13:48.71,00:13:48.71,"When you are finished, read number two."""
250,00:13:51.88,00:13:51.88,>> Okay. >> All right.
251,00:13:53.21,00:13:53.21,">> ""Note number two."" >> ""Congratulations, you have"
252,00:13:56.42,00:13:56.42,"just divided yourself into two new tribes."""
253,00:13:59.92,00:13:59.92,>> I thought there were gonna be ten new buffs in the box and
254,00:14:02.29,00:14:02.29,that we were gonna be a merged tribe.
255,00:14:04.67,00:14:04.67,I just never in a million years... predicted.
256,00:14:07.92,00:14:07.92,">> ""The odd numbers are the new Fang Tribe."
257,00:14:11.88,00:14:11.88,"The even numbers are the new Kota Tribe."""
258,00:14:14.83,00:14:14.83,>> Not again! (chuckles) Damn! (sighs)
259,00:14:18.38,00:14:18.38,">> ""Open the bag, collect your new buffs, and immediately"
260,00:14:22.29,00:14:22.29,return to your respective camps. The game has changed once
261,00:14:25.50,00:14:25.50,"again."" >> I knew that was gonna happen."
262,00:14:27.62,00:14:27.62,">> ""Enjoy the adventure."" The new Kota Tribe is Bob and"
263,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,"Marcus, Susie, Crystal and Kenny."
264,00:14:33.42,00:14:33.42,"I missed you once, I'll miss you again."
265,00:14:35.75,00:14:35.75,"I'll see you in a day or two. The new Fang Tribe: myself,"
266,00:14:38.79,00:14:38.79,"Charlie and Corinne, and then we've got Matty and Sugar."
267,00:14:42.33,00:14:42.33,"Charlie and Corinne and myself have a deal, so... we're safe."
268,00:14:45.62,00:14:45.62,"Uh, I am worried about Marcus. I just don't trust Susie."
269,00:14:50.17,00:14:50.17,"Susie's crazy and Susie's stupid, and that's a horrible"
270,00:14:54.00,00:14:54.00,combination. >> Are you going?
271,00:14:55.71,00:14:55.71,>> Yeah. See you in a day or two.
272,00:14:58.21,00:14:58.21,">> We actually got lucky, and there is a majority of the Kota"
273,00:15:01.54,00:15:01.54,six in each of the two tribes. I don't need the immunity idol.
274,00:15:04.96,00:15:04.96,I have great relationships in this game.
275,00:15:06.79,00:15:06.79,And that's honestly what I'm banking on.
276,00:15:08.58,00:15:08.58,"Because I know, at the end of the day, that no immunity idol"
277,00:15:11.21,00:15:11.21,"gets me to the finals. >> Are you here with us, or are"
278,00:15:13.75,00:15:13.75,you leaving? >> I feel like I have a lot more
279,00:15:16.29,00:15:16.29,"power right now, because I really can, if I want to,"
280,00:15:19.62,00:15:19.62,swing... with Kenny and Crystal and take the power away from
281,00:15:25.04,00:15:25.04,Marcus and Bob. >> I'm still... the enemy.
282,00:15:29.38,00:15:29.38,"Even though I have on a yellow bandana, I don't feel very"
283,00:15:32.21,00:15:32.21,hopeful right now as far as me lasting in this game if I'm
284,00:15:37.12,00:15:37.12,gonna be on the shorter end of the stick.
285,00:15:59.21,00:15:59.21,(indistinct chatter) >> Welcome home.
286,00:16:03.25,00:16:03.25,>> Thank you. >> Yes. This is it.
287,00:16:04.79,00:16:04.79,>> You ready to do this? >> Are you ready to do this?
288,00:16:10.42,00:16:10.42,>> I'm ready to do this. >> It's Kota.
289,00:16:12.25,00:16:12.25,">> 'Cause you know what this means, right?"
290,00:16:14.25,00:16:14.25,">> Yeah, this is... This is us, Bob."
291,00:16:20.08,00:16:20.08,>> Yes. Yes. >> Everybody thought it was
292,00:16:23.08,00:16:23.08,"gonna be the merge, but now I'm Kota."
293,00:16:25.21,00:16:25.21,"Over here, all I have is Crystal."
294,00:16:26.92,00:16:26.92,"I feel like I don't have numbers, and I feel like, you"
295,00:16:29.75,00:16:29.75,"know, I might be the next to go, but hopefully, that's not the"
296,00:16:32.62,00:16:32.62,"case. >> I know, that's so cool."
297,00:16:40.21,00:16:40.21,">> Yes, he is. >> One of my best friends from"
298,00:16:45.29,00:16:45.29,Atlanta is her cousin. >> Yeah. 'Cause we were just
299,00:16:48.38,00:16:48.38,"talking, and he was just, like, ""Yeah, you may not know this guy"
300,00:16:51.29,00:16:51.29,"named Kenny. Kenny Cox."" >> And she's, like, ""Actually,"
301,00:16:55.00,00:16:55.00,"yeah..."" >> ""Yeah, that's my cousin."""
302,00:16:56.62,00:16:56.62,(laughs) >> It's a small world.
303,00:16:59.25,00:16:59.25,>> That's insane. >> I come to find out that
304,00:17:03.04,00:17:03.04,Crystal is the cousin of one of my best friends.
305,00:17:06.62,00:17:06.62,"It's a really strange situation, because I feel... a little torn."
306,00:17:12.83,00:17:12.83,I'm in a situation where I have completely calculated voting her
307,00:17:16.50,00:17:16.50,"out. But, you know, since we changed"
308,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,"tribes, I don't know if that's still the case."
309,00:17:23.04,00:17:23.04,"If you're anything like your cousin, I mean, then I know..."
310,00:17:26.88,00:17:26.88,"I know you're good people, and-and I just... I just want to"
311,00:17:29.54,00:17:29.54,"keep good people around, but... >> That's, that's how I am."
312,00:17:31.88,00:17:31.88,"I think that was Kenny's concern, too."
313,00:17:36.12,00:17:36.12,>> Crystal is actually a really cool girl.
314,00:17:38.21,00:17:38.21,This is a person I can be straight-up with.
315,00:17:40.46,00:17:40.46,This is a person I can talk to. This is me crumpling up my
316,00:17:43.46,00:17:43.46,"playbook, throwing it out the window."
317,00:17:45.88,00:17:45.88,">> I'm telling you, this is my word."
318,00:17:47.67,00:17:47.67,>> Yeah. >> In the unlikely event we have
319,00:17:50.08,00:17:50.08,"to go to Tribal, I'm not writing your name down."
320,00:17:52.62,00:17:52.62,>> Yeah. >> I'm not writing Kenny's name
321,00:17:54.29,00:17:54.29,down. I'm not writing Bob's name down.
322,00:17:56.21,00:17:56.21,>> Yeah. I'm... >> I'm telling you that right
323,00:17:57.83,00:17:57.83,"now. Marcus and I now have a link,"
324,00:18:00.50,00:18:00.50,"and hopefully, I can use that link to my advantage."
325,00:18:04.42,00:18:04.42,"But me telling Marcus that I won't write his name down,"
326,00:18:08.25,00:18:08.25,that's me playing the game. Because I also told Ace I would
327,00:18:11.29,00:18:11.29,"not write his name down, and Ace got blindsided."
328,00:18:19.96,00:18:19.96,"(trumpeting) >> Welcome to Fang, everybody."
329,00:18:30.04,00:18:30.04,">> Thanks. >> That was a surprise, huh?"
330,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17,">> Oh, my God. I knew that kind of crap was"
331,00:18:35.67,00:18:35.67,gonna happen. >> Yeah?
332,00:18:37.38,00:18:37.38,">> I didn't want to believe it. >> The Kota Six, before the"
333,00:18:40.33,00:18:40.33,"switch-up, decided that we were all gonna stick together going"
334,00:18:43.25,00:18:43.25,into the hypothetical merge. But now we've been split up into
335,00:18:45.33,00:18:45.33,"two tribes... The Kota Six, luckily, were"
336,00:18:52.25,00:18:52.25,up three-two in both of the tribes.
337,00:18:54.21,00:18:54.21,"So we can still execute our plan and stay together, Kota Six."
338,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,"So I need to make sure that here at Fang, Corinne, Randy and I"
339,00:19:01.33,00:19:01.33,stick together as the previous members of the Kota Tribe.
340,00:19:07.83,00:19:07.83,">> Oh. >> It's good to see you, man."
341,00:19:15.88,00:19:15.88,">> You, too. >> It's suicide."
342,00:19:27.00,00:19:27.00,"I mean, if she has the idol... The only thing we can say is we"
343,00:19:29.71,00:19:29.71,"can tell Matty we're voting for Sugar, Sugar we're voting for"
344,00:19:31.58,00:19:31.58,"Matty, and then hope that if she has the idol, Matty goes."
345,00:19:33.67,00:19:33.67,">> If I were to vote tomorrow, I would vote for Matty."
346,00:19:35.88,00:19:35.88,He doesn't have a hidden immunity idol and he's too much
347,00:19:37.96,00:19:37.96,"of a threat for me in individual immunity, and he's threatening"
348,00:19:40.12,00:19:40.12,to Marcus and Marcus is my alliance.
349,00:19:42.00,00:19:42.00,So he will go home as soon as we vote.
350,00:19:44.71,00:19:44.71,>> How do you get along with Corinne and Charlie?
351,00:19:47.25,00:19:47.25,>> Awesome. My first gay friend.
352,00:19:49.42,00:19:49.42,">> What about Corinne? >> She's-she's cool, too."
353,00:19:51.21,00:19:51.21,">> Randy is a great dude, I love having him around, but I don't"
354,00:19:54.08,00:19:54.08,"trust him. He went to Kota, he found a"
355,00:19:57.88,00:19:57.88,"home at Kota, and that's his new family."
356,00:20:03.21,00:20:03.21,"I'm not too unpleased that Ace got voted out, because I"
357,00:20:06.33,00:20:06.33,"didn't have to do it, I didn't have to break my promise."
358,00:20:08.79,00:20:08.79,">> Uh-huh. >> But it upset me, because you"
359,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,just went along with Crystal like that.
360,00:20:12.96,00:20:12.96,">> I thought I was going along with Kenny, 'cause Kenny was"
361,00:20:15.46,00:20:15.46,"being honest with me. >> No, Kenny didn't trust Ace."
362,00:20:18.00,00:20:18.00,>> Wow...! >> Y-Y-You...
363,00:20:21.00,00:20:21.00,>> I know. I know. >> Ace was covering you the
364,00:20:22.88,00:20:22.88,whole time. He never was gunning for you.
365,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,Ever. >> Now I believe that.
366,00:20:27.33,00:20:27.33,">> And he might have gunned for you later, but he wasn't gunning"
367,00:20:29.92,00:20:29.92,for you now. >> I didn't know.
368,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,I think Kenny and Crystal duped me.
369,00:20:36.71,00:20:36.71,I feel awful that I got rid of Ace.
370,00:20:39.75,00:20:39.75,I feel so bad. I wish I could apologize to Ace.
371,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,"I think I may have made a big mistake, and I feel really bad."
372,00:20:48.25,00:20:48.25,I believe you. Thank you.
373,00:20:51.58,00:20:51.58,"We have to, I guess. >> There's nothing else to do."
374,00:20:54.29,00:20:54.29,It's just you or I. >> You're right.
375,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,>> We have to keep our eyes and ears open.
376,00:20:57.54,00:20:57.54,"So, if I hear that you're going to be voted out..."
377,00:20:59.21,00:20:59.21,>> Yeah? >> You've got to use the idol.
378,00:21:01.21,00:21:01.21,>> I know. >> If you're gonna hear that I'm
379,00:21:02.71,00:21:02.71,"going to get voted out, you gotta tell me so I can try to"
380,00:21:05.21,00:21:05.21,maneuver something. Me and Sugar have each other's
381,00:21:06.96,00:21:06.96,"back and she has the idol. So, I think we can help each"
382,00:21:09.25,00:21:09.25,other. >> Were you trying to bring this
383,00:21:21.75,00:21:21.75,"back? >> Yeah, I have."
384,00:21:23.04,00:21:23.04,I've brought some big logs back. I just...
385,00:21:25.79,00:21:25.79,"I might have to break this up. Hey, you know what?"
386,00:21:27.96,00:21:27.96,It might be easier to pull it up that way and then take it
387,00:21:30.00,00:21:30.00,out. >> We have a powerful pact to
388,00:21:34.29,00:21:34.29,get us to the final six without even batting an eyelash.
389,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,The way things divided up is perfect.
390,00:21:40.71,00:21:40.71,">> And theoretically, like, nothing should change."
391,00:21:43.04,00:21:43.04,Bob gives me a lot of confidence that he's not going
392,00:21:45.42,00:21:45.42,to budge on the situation. But Susie always made me a bit
393,00:21:48.46,00:21:48.46,"nervous. I think, given the opportunity,"
394,00:21:51.50,00:21:51.50,she would sell me down the river in a second.
395,00:21:57.71,00:21:57.71,">> We have numbers on both sides, kind of, right now."
396,00:22:00.17,00:22:00.17,Let's say for some reason we lost.
397,00:22:02.83,00:22:02.83,I can make a decision to go one way or the other.
398,00:22:05.79,00:22:05.79,>> I am far more paranoid than I have been in this game.
399,00:22:09.12,00:22:09.12,Kenny and Crystal are super tight and Bob and I are super
400,00:22:11.71,00:22:11.71,"tight here and Susie's in the middle, spinning around in"
401,00:22:14.75,00:22:14.75,"circles, playing dizzy bat. And where is she going to stop?"
402,00:22:17.38,00:22:17.38,I have no idea. >> We can make it to the top
403,00:22:19.67,00:22:19.67,"six. That's our goal, right?  >> Yeah."
404,00:22:21.12,00:22:21.12,"But then, when we're there, where does that put me, then?"
405,00:22:23.12,00:22:23.12,'Cause I am one of the weaker people. Is that gonna...
406,00:22:24.71,00:22:24.71,Am I always going to be sixth? Because think about it.
407,00:22:28.54,00:22:28.54,"It's one thing to be in the top six, but I need to be in the"
408,00:22:30.62,00:22:30.62,"top three. Marcus is basically the king,"
409,00:22:35.04,00:22:35.04,but I have the power right now to just cut his head off.
410,00:22:38.17,00:22:38.17,"If I do switch, it's his own fault because he didn't give me"
411,00:22:40.67,00:22:40.67,a clear statement. (snorting)
412,00:23:04.04,00:23:04.04,>> We got mail! >> I just think...
413,00:23:08.92,00:23:08.92,"Can you imagine a better... I mean, three and three?"
414,00:23:11.92,00:23:11.92,>> It's perfect. >> My only concern is that that
415,00:23:13.79,00:23:13.79,crazy bitch Susie could flip to get rid of Bob and Marcus.
416,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17,">> And that is a ""save Marcus"" move more than anything."
417,00:23:24.88,00:23:24.88,"And then, then it doesn't really matter what crazy Susie does."
418,00:23:28.79,00:23:28.79,>> Right. I was very pleased with the
419,00:23:30.12,00:23:30.12,conversation I had with Randy this morning just regarding
420,00:23:32.54,00:23:32.54,"Matty, because we need to get rid of him first if we have to"
421,00:23:35.38,00:23:35.38,"go to Tribal, and, like, he totally is on board."
422,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,"100%. >> If we have to go, as much as"
423,00:23:41.25,00:23:41.25,"I'd hate to do it, we'd have to take out Matty."
424,00:23:44.12,00:23:44.12,>> Yeah. >> Just because of the idol.
425,00:23:46.17,00:23:46.17,"There is a one in a billion chance that Sugar is, like, a"
426,00:23:50.58,00:23:50.58,rocket scientist and she's hiding the idol.
427,00:23:53.04,00:23:53.04,"I'd like to see Matty stay around, but keeping Charlie and"
428,00:23:57.33,00:23:57.33,Corinne happy is more important than keeping Matty happy.
429,00:24:00.21,00:24:00.21,">> Hey, we got mail! ""If you can't keep it up, there"
430,00:24:04.25,00:24:04.25,is reason to worry. You may be the first to join
431,00:24:07.12,00:24:07.12,"the jury."" >> If we can't keep it up? Up."
432,00:24:09.29,00:24:09.29,Something in the air. >> You've seen the challenges
433,00:24:11.00,00:24:11.00,where your wrist is like strapped to a huge bucket of
434,00:24:13.33,00:24:13.33,water? >> Oh!
435,00:24:14.92,00:24:14.92,">> At this point in the game, I'm very concerned about my"
436,00:24:17.29,00:24:17.29,"time here, and I don't know how much I have left."
437,00:24:20.46,00:24:20.46,Every moment seems to be pretty valuable.
438,00:24:23.21,00:24:23.21,So today I'm going to give it my all.
439,00:24:31.75,00:24:31.75,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! How you guys doing?"
440,00:24:46.62,00:24:46.62,>> Great. >> Good.
441,00:24:48.71,00:24:48.71,">> PROBST: Marcus, are you starting to think maybe you"
442,00:24:50.33,00:24:50.33,don't have this game completely figured out?
443,00:24:52.83,00:24:52.83,">> Uh, yeah, I threw away my game plan the minute I saw that"
444,00:24:56.62,00:24:56.62,box open up and reached in and pulled a number out.
445,00:24:59.08,00:24:59.08,">> PROBST: Corinne, happy with the new tribe division?"
446,00:25:01.50,00:25:01.50,">> You know, I've been Kota for a really long time."
447,00:25:03.21,00:25:03.21,"I still feel like Kota. In fact, we're not calling it"
448,00:25:05.58,00:25:05.58,"""Fang."" We're calling it ""Fayng,"" just"
449,00:25:07.04,00:25:07.04,"'cause ""Fang"" has such a bad connotation."
450,00:25:08.62,00:25:08.62,">> PROBST: Matty, as the only true remaining Fang member,"
451,00:25:12.42,00:25:12.42,"is it hard to hear Corinne say, ""We don't even say 'Fang'"
452,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,"'cause that's tainted."" >> I'm trapped in the "
453,00:25:18.88,00:25:18.88,"ghetto, man-- I can't get out of the ghetto, so whatever you want"
454,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,"to call it, I don't care. ""Fang,"" ""Fayng,"" I just want to"
455,00:25:25.21,00:25:25.21,get out of there one day. (Corinne laughing)
456,00:25:28.42,00:25:28.42,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
457,00:25:30.58,00:25:30.58,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
458,00:25:33.21,00:25:33.21,"is back up for grabs. Today's challenge, very simple"
459,00:25:37.04,00:25:37.04,"in concept, much more difficult to execute."
460,00:25:39.83,00:25:39.83,"With your arms outstretched, you will use the tops of your"
461,00:25:43.33,00:25:43.33,hands to hold two polls against an overhead board.
462,00:25:47.96,00:25:47.96,"If you lower your arms even slightly, you'll release the"
463,00:25:52.00,00:25:52.00,"pressure on the polls, the polls will drop."
464,00:25:54.58,00:25:54.58,"When a poll drops, you're out of the challenge."
465,00:25:57.08,00:25:57.08,The last person left standing wins immunity for their entire
466,00:26:01.71,00:26:01.71,"tribe, keeps the entire tribe safe from Tribal Council."
467,00:26:05.38,00:26:05.38,"To put it another way, the first tribe to lose all their"
468,00:26:09.38,00:26:09.38,members from this challenge goes to Tribal Council.
469,00:26:12.33,00:26:12.33,Somebody will be voted out. Make sense?
470,00:26:14.96,00:26:14.96,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Each of you has an
471,00:26:16.79,00:26:16.79,individual station that has been adjusted based on your
472,00:26:19.50,00:26:19.50,"height, so everything is fair. Take a spot at your station."
473,00:26:22.25,00:26:22.25,We'll get started. Everybody feel good?
474,00:26:31.33,00:26:31.33,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Okay.
475,00:26:34.12,00:26:34.12,This challenge is officially underway.
476,00:26:39.88,00:26:39.88,"And after one second, Crystal is out."
477,00:26:44.12,00:26:44.12,Last person left in this challenge wins immunity for
478,00:26:47.04,00:26:47.04,their entire tribe. You will be a hero.
479,00:26:52.17,00:26:52.17,Sugar is out after ten seconds. This is all about mind over
480,00:26:57.17,00:26:57.17,matter. It is going to hurt and it's
481,00:26:58.88,00:26:58.88,going to hurt quickly. 24 days you've been out here
482,00:27:03.21,00:27:03.21,living on very little. Not much sleep.
483,00:27:08.12,00:27:08.12,A lot of mental pressure. Susie's out of the challenge
484,00:27:13.79,00:27:13.79,for Kota. Kota now down to three members
485,00:27:16.46,00:27:16.46,left. Randy's starting to shake a bit.
486,00:27:31.00,00:27:31.00,"Randy's out of the challenge, and Corinne is out of the"
487,00:27:33.00,00:27:33.00,challenge. Two more Fang members drop at
488,00:27:35.46,00:27:35.46,the same time. Fang now down to two people
489,00:27:39.75,00:27:39.75,left. Kenny drops the pole.
490,00:27:50.75,00:27:50.75,Kenny is out of the challenge for Kota.
491,00:27:52.79,00:27:52.79,"Very quickly, this is coming down to a showdown."
492,00:27:56.21,00:27:56.21,Bob and Marcus left for Kota. Charlie and Matty left for Fang.
493,00:28:04.42,00:28:04.42,"Marcus starting to shake a little bit, going to have to"
494,00:28:07.08,00:28:07.08,"dig deep, find somewhere else to go."
495,00:28:11.33,00:28:11.33,Change arm position. Marcus drops the pole.
496,00:28:19.08,00:28:19.08,He's out of the challenge. Kota down to their last member.
497,00:28:21.67,00:28:21.67,"The oldest person in this game, Bob, fighting to hold on to"
498,00:28:26.21,00:28:26.21,"Tribal immunity for Kota, while Matty and Charlie fight for"
499,00:28:31.12,00:28:31.12,"Fang. Bob drops his poles, Kota goes"
500,00:28:34.38,00:28:34.38,"to Tribal Council, somebody going home."
501,00:28:38.17,00:28:38.17,Charlie struggling to hang on. Charlie is out.
502,00:28:48.08,00:28:48.08,"We have a showdown. Matty, the last Fang member"
503,00:28:52.88,00:28:52.88,"remaining and Bob, the last Kota member remaining."
504,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,">> Ain't no thing, Bobby Boy. >> PROBST: Do not get foolish."
505,00:29:01.58,00:29:01.58,Don't lose your concentration. Don't start listening to
506,00:29:04.04,00:29:04.04,"anybody, including me. All it takes is a moment's"
507,00:29:08.88,00:29:08.88,lapse in your concentration and you're out of this challenge.
508,00:29:12.38,00:29:12.38,That's it. (laughs)
509,00:29:14.58,00:29:14.58,>> PROBST: Block it out. >> Matty's going to drop.
510,00:29:18.46,00:29:18.46,He's going to drop. Matty's been shaking for a
511,00:29:21.25,00:29:21.25,"while, Bob, stick it up. (Matty laughs)"
512,00:29:23.62,00:29:23.62,>> PROBST: Matty's going to be laughing his way right to
513,00:29:25.42,00:29:25.42,Tribal Council. That pole is right on the
514,00:29:27.38,00:29:27.38,edge. Both poles on the edge of the
515,00:29:29.21,00:29:29.21,board for Matty. You need to stop jabbering and
516,00:29:32.17,00:29:32.17,"start concentrating. >> You've got this, Bob."
517,00:29:36.25,00:29:36.25,>> PROBST: Matty has less than a quarter of an inch hanging on
518,00:29:40.62,00:29:40.62,"to the edge of that board. If it slips off, it will fall."
519,00:29:45.12,00:29:45.12,It's over for Fang. Bob hanging in there for Kota.
520,00:29:51.12,00:29:51.12,Matty fighting. That pole is right on the edge.
521,00:29:55.46,00:29:55.46,">> Hold on, Bob. Hold on, Bob. >> PROBST: Trying to work it"
522,00:29:58.08,00:29:58.08,back now. Bob hanging in there for Kota.
523,00:30:03.12,00:30:03.12,Matty flirting with disaster. Bob drops his pole!
524,00:30:11.83,00:30:11.83,Matty wins immunity for the Fang tribe.
525,00:30:19.92,00:30:19.92,">> Way to go, man. I couldn't do it."
526,00:30:21.96,00:30:21.96,">> Good job, Bob. >> PROBST: Matty,"
527,00:30:24.38,00:30:24.38,congratulations. Not only do you keep yourself
528,00:30:26.04,00:30:26.04,"safe, you keep your entire tribe safe."
529,00:30:28.38,00:30:28.38,Nice job. Matty single-handedly wins
530,00:30:31.54,00:30:31.54,immunity for the Fang tribe. >> PROBST: Grab your stuff.
531,00:30:33.88,00:30:33.88,"Head back to camp. >> It's ""Fayng."""
532,00:30:35.88,00:30:35.88,">> PROBST: Don't forget your tribe flag, Fayng."
533,00:30:39.83,00:30:39.83,">> It was good to win, but it really didn't matter."
534,00:30:42.58,00:30:42.58,"In fact, if we had lost, I'm absolutely sure that Matty"
535,00:30:45.92,00:30:45.92,would have been going home. >> I'm pretty happy with myself
536,00:30:50.58,00:30:50.58,"right now that I, uh, I managed to pull that off."
537,00:30:53.25,00:30:53.25,"Now the curiosity is killing me. What's going to happen in Kota,"
538,00:30:56.25,00:30:56.25,'cause it's totally up in the air.
539,00:31:00.04,00:31:00.04,">> PROBST: Kota, not such good news for you."
540,00:31:03.12,00:31:03.12,Tribal Council tonight where one of the five of you will be
541,00:31:05.50,00:31:05.50,"voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to"
542,00:31:07.88,00:31:07.88,camp. I will see you at Tribal.
543,00:31:12.21,00:31:12.21,>> I would like to see either Kenny or Crystal go home.
544,00:31:15.54,00:31:15.54,The big question for me is can I get to the final three by
545,00:31:18.12,00:31:18.12,trusting Marcus? We'll see where this is going
546,00:31:20.17,00:31:20.17,to get me. I've got to get to that top
547,00:31:22.12,00:31:22.12,"three, I have to. >> We just got back from our"
548,00:31:45.00,00:31:45.00,"first challenge as Kota Part Three, and it was a less than"
549,00:31:48.88,00:31:48.88,ideal result. >> You did awesome.
550,00:31:50.58,00:31:50.58,>> I really looked up to you. >> Yeah.
551,00:31:52.25,00:31:52.25,">> You did really great. >> Oh, wow."
552,00:31:54.00,00:31:54.00,">> I didn't even get one second out of it, 'cause it just"
553,00:31:56.08,00:31:56.08,wasn't... it didn't fit right. >> Once they tilted it in I'm
554,00:31:58.83,00:31:58.83,"like, damn it. >> That was a tough one, for"
555,00:32:00.62,00:32:00.62,"sure. Unfortunately, either Kenny"
556,00:32:03.50,00:32:03.50,or Crystal is going to have to go home tonight.
557,00:32:06.75,00:32:06.75,"I would prefer to have Ken go home tonight, just because"
558,00:32:09.58,00:32:09.58,Crystal and I have a reasonably good relationship at this point.
559,00:32:16.88,00:32:16.88,Let me tell you what I was thinking-- and I need you to be
560,00:32:19.21,00:32:19.21,"super honest if you can do it or not-- would be, like, I hate to"
561,00:32:23.00,00:32:23.00,"say it, but like, if Ken goes home tonight then we're good."
562,00:32:27.54,00:32:27.54,And then that gives us a shoe in for who goes next.
563,00:32:30.29,00:32:30.29,"Like, it's obviously going to be Susie."
564,00:32:32.54,00:32:32.54,"That's, that's a no-brainer for me."
565,00:32:35.33,00:32:35.33,"But the hope is that you're now part of the Kota Six, instead of"
566,00:32:38.38,00:32:38.38,"Susie. It just... >> Well, can you sell 'em on it?"
567,00:32:41.71,00:32:41.71,">> Yeah, because Corinne can't stand Susie."
568,00:32:44.83,00:32:44.83,"Randy, you know can't stand Susie and frankly, Crystal,"
569,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,the benefit of you screwing up in challenges is that...
570,00:32:53.46,00:32:53.46,">> Right now, I am batting zero. >> I hate to do this."
571,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,">> Marcus and I now have a solid relationship, but when you"
572,00:33:06.79,00:33:06.79,start talking about knocking off my number-one ally just so
573,00:33:10.71,00:33:10.71,"you can get further in the game, I'm not pleased. At all."
574,00:33:15.25,00:33:15.25,>> I know you told me yesterday you weren't writing my name
575,00:33:16.96,00:33:16.96,down. >> No.
576,00:33:18.38,00:33:18.38,>> I'm telling you that I'm not writing your name down tonight.
577,00:33:20.29,00:33:20.29,">> Marcus is playing the nice guy, but he's a schemer."
578,00:33:23.58,00:33:23.58,"I'm playing nice girl, liar and schemer."
579,00:33:27.75,00:33:27.75,"The game is outwit, outlast and you can't outwit Crystal Cox,"
580,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,baby. >> I'm thinking that the least
581,00:33:36.88,00:33:36.88,threatening person is Crystal. She's not going to beat us.
582,00:33:40.25,00:33:40.25,"I mean, she has not run faster, she cannot swim, she can't"
583,00:33:42.71,00:33:42.71,balance. She can't even do the hand
584,00:33:44.25,00:33:44.25,"thing. >> Yeah, she had a hard time"
585,00:33:45.92,00:33:45.92,"with that. >> So, let's minimize our risk"
586,00:33:47.33,00:33:47.33,of somebody getting immunity. >> I said we should take
587,00:33:50.21,00:33:50.21,Crystal out first because she may do better now that she's
588,00:33:52.75,00:33:52.75,"eating. >> Yeah, but you..."
589,00:33:54.17,00:33:54.17,">> But then at the same time... >> Bob beat her, I beat her..."
590,00:33:56.12,00:33:56.12,"Like, she couldn't even hold-- You beat her. She's atrocious."
591,00:33:58.50,00:33:58.50,">> Yeah, yeah. >> My thought was tonight Ken"
592,00:34:00.88,00:34:00.88,and then hopefully we don't have to go for a while but then
593,00:34:04.12,00:34:04.12,Crystal would be next. >> Marcus has a lot of control
594,00:34:07.21,00:34:07.21,of who should be voted off and Bob's just going to follow
595,00:34:09.83,00:34:09.83,whatever he says. I feel safer at this point
596,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,to stay with Marcus in which way we're going to vote.
597,00:34:16.08,00:34:16.08,"Right now I'm actually putting trust in you, and that's huge."
598,00:34:19.00,00:34:19.00,>> I thought we've been doing that for a while at this point.
599,00:34:21.42,00:34:21.42,">> Yeah, I know. And my guarantee is that you "
600,00:34:24.25,00:34:24.25,"will help me get there. >> Once we get there, let's say"
601,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,that you got Matty and Randy there.
602,00:34:29.29,00:34:29.29,>> Then it's just... But everybody knows Matty's a
603,00:34:32.62,00:34:32.62,"threat so, Matty's gonna go first and then Randy and Bob"
604,00:34:36.04,00:34:36.04,and then Corinne... >> I'm good with that.
605,00:34:39.54,00:34:39.54,">> So, that makes the most sense."
606,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,>> Okay. >> I feel like I can use Marcus
607,00:34:44.25,00:34:44.25,to get me at least to the top three so I have a chance at one.
608,00:34:47.38,00:34:47.38,That's how I look at it. >> Yeah.
609,00:34:57.75,00:34:57.75,>> Okay. >> Okay.
610,00:34:59.29,00:34:59.29,Susie will either go with us or she gets voted off tonight.
611,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,That's... that's... What do you mean no?
612,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,What do you mean? >> Really?
613,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,>> Yes. I can't let them do it.
614,00:35:16.33,00:35:16.33,>> Marcus told you that he wanted to write my name down?
615,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,">> Yes. And I'm not writing your name,"
616,00:35:23.25,00:35:23.25,Kenny. >> Kenny being safe tonight is
617,00:35:29.58,00:35:29.58,riding 100% on Sue. Or else Kenny goes home.
618,00:35:37.67,00:35:37.67,">> Did you clean the fish, Bob? >> What's that?"
619,00:35:39.12,00:35:39.12,">> You clean the fish? >> Yeah, I got it all right."
620,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,>> Almost ready to eat. >> I don't feel super
621,00:36:24.38,00:36:24.38,comfortable if I was to vote with Crystal and Kenny and
622,00:36:27.62,00:36:27.62,vote off Marcus. 'Cause I don't know if Crystal
623,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,and Kenny could help me get to the top three.
624,00:36:36.46,00:36:36.46,">> Susie, Susie... Okay?"
625,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,>> Okay. I have a huge decision to
626,00:36:43.62,00:36:43.62,make tonight in which way to go. Either Marcus or Bob or I can
627,00:36:46.92,00:36:46.92,vote with Kenny and Crystal. I don't know if it's good or
628,00:36:49.75,00:36:49.75,bad. I'm confused and I just don't
629,00:36:51.29,00:36:51.29,know. I don't know how to feel about
630,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,it right now. It's scary and that's the truth.
631,00:37:21.62,00:37:21.62,">> PROBST: So, Crystal, you and Kenny had not spent any time"
632,00:37:24.62,00:37:24.62,with Kota. What's it like?
633,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,">> To me, the Kota camp is like corporate espionage."
634,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,"You wear the suit, but what's going on in your head?"
635,00:37:34.29,00:37:34.29,"Whereas at Fang, this is the projects, I'm eating some rice,"
636,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,"we're hungry, let's go to war. And over there it's like ""I wear"
637,00:37:42.21,00:37:42.21,"my suit."" >> PROBST: So, Bob, now that a"
638,00:37:45.17,00:37:45.17,"merge maybe isn't around the corner, does it change your"
639,00:37:47.96,00:37:47.96,strategy? >> Yes.
640,00:37:49.75,00:37:49.75,Last time I was here one of the reasons I made the decision I
641,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,made was I thought a merge was imminent.
642,00:37:55.38,00:37:55.38,"I made a mistake. >> PROBST: So, you're saying you"
643,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,regret your last vote? >> Had I known it was going to
644,00:38:00.88,00:38:00.88,"go this way, yes, I might have done something differently."
645,00:38:04.00,00:38:04.00,">> PROBST: So, Marcus, is it important to keep this tribe"
646,00:38:06.29,00:38:06.29,physically strong to win challenges or that I hang on to
647,00:38:09.58,00:38:09.58,this alliance and hope that a merge is coming?
648,00:38:12.12,00:38:12.12,>> I think it's important to keep the tribe physically
649,00:38:14.33,00:38:14.33,strong and ready for challenges. My hope is to keep us as strong
650,00:38:17.92,00:38:17.92,"as we can. >> I think that's total bull,"
651,00:38:20.25,00:38:20.25,what he just said in his mouth. He's definitely looking for a
652,00:38:23.12,00:38:23.12,merge around the corner and have numbers to take out Fang.
653,00:38:26.12,00:38:26.12,"Is it not a strategy, Marcus, to vote out Fang?"
654,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,>> You know very well that we beat you guys seven times in a
655,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,row and why would we want to change any of the people in
656,00:38:34.12,00:38:34.12,"there? Frankly, I think you're really"
657,00:38:36.12,00:38:36.12,a nice guy and it sucks that your frustration is being
658,00:38:38.12,00:38:38.12,"taken out in this direction, you know?"
659,00:38:40.38,00:38:40.38,>> But I feel that you are the leader of Kota and that you
660,00:38:44.00,00:38:44.00,are the special Kota guy that everybody's listening to to
661,00:38:47.38,00:38:47.38,vote somebody off. >> I'm one of the five opinions
662,00:38:49.92,00:38:49.92,here and we don't see who we vote for until the final vote
663,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,"is called, so... >> PROBST: So, Bob, getting to"
664,00:38:57.88,00:38:57.88,"the vote, is it clear-cut? >> Uh, yes."
665,00:39:01.58,00:39:01.58,"Yeah. >> PROBST: Susie, is this an"
666,00:39:04.58,00:39:04.58,easy decision for you tonight? >> I've made my decision and
667,00:39:08.04,00:39:08.04,"I'm okay with it. >> PROBST: All right, it is time"
668,00:39:12.62,00:39:12.62,"to get to the vote. Marcus, you're up."
669,00:39:25.12,00:39:25.12,">> Ken, sorry, buddy, it's just that it's time."
670,00:39:35.21,00:39:35.21,>> You are not the Kota god. Good-bye.
671,00:39:46.25,00:39:46.25,">> Sorry, Ken. However, spilling your guts"
672,00:39:49.21,00:39:49.21,tonight makes it a little bit easier.
673,00:39:58.29,00:39:58.29,>> You like comics when the little guy takes out the big guy
674,00:40:00.92,00:40:00.92,"or the bully? Well, hopefully that happens"
675,00:40:03.71,00:40:03.71,tonight. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
676,00:40:23.58,00:40:23.58,votes. If anybody has the hidden
677,00:40:35.88,00:40:35.88,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
678,00:40:38.08,00:40:38.08,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
679,00:40:43.54,00:40:43.54,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
680,00:40:45.25,00:40:45.25,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
681,00:40:47.83,00:40:47.83,I'll read the votes. First vote...
682,00:40:53.04,00:40:53.04,Marcus. Kenny.
683,00:40:58.42,00:40:58.42,"One vote Marcus, one vote Kenny. Kenny."
684,00:41:03.67,00:41:03.67,"Two votes Kenny, one vote Marcus."
685,00:41:08.79,00:41:08.79,Marcus. We're tied.
686,00:41:10.79,00:41:10.79,"Two votes Marcus, two votes Kenny."
687,00:41:13.46,00:41:13.46,One vote left. Ninth person voted out of
688,00:41:20.25,00:41:20.25,Survivor: Gabon and the first member of our jury...
689,00:41:24.29,00:41:24.29,Marcus. You need to bring me your torch.
690,00:41:36.67,00:41:36.67,"Marcus, the tribe has spoken. Just when you think you're"
691,00:41:51.12,00:41:51.12,"in control of this game, blindside."
692,00:41:54.12,00:41:54.12,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."

697,00:42:12.08,00:42:12.08,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor.
698,00:42:23.25,00:42:23.25,Meet the new Fayng. >> Just set it forward and drop
699,00:42:25.42,00:42:25.42,"it, please. >> Shh!"
700,00:42:27.12,00:42:27.12,">> Right now, just drop it. >> PROBST: Same as the old Fang."
701,00:42:29.67,00:42:29.67,"Fayng, one big happy tribe, obviously."
702,00:42:31.67,00:42:31.67,"And at Kota, Kenny is the man of the house."
703,00:42:34.04,00:42:34.04,>> Right now I know for a fact that I can win this game.
704,00:42:41.92,00:42:41.92,>> I see the future of Kota Part Three as being probably a
705,00:42:45.58,00:42:45.58,"very sneaky one. I mean, talk about corporate"
706,00:42:48.96,00:42:48.96,espionage. I feel bad for Bob.
707,00:42:51.17,00:42:51.17,I don't see him necessarily surviving the next few days.
708,00:42:54.25,00:42:54.25,"You know, obviously the people that wrote my name down get to"
709,00:42:56.67,00:42:56.67,"see me in the future. And, you know, I forgive, but I"
710,00:42:59.54,00:42:59.54,don't forget.
