497,00:29:31.57,00:29:31.57,IN ORDER TO GET MORE RICE. BUT THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE
498,00:29:35.37,00:29:35.37,HEAVY. THAT'S GOING TO HIT HARD.
499,00:29:36.67,00:29:36.67,I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO I'M SCARED.

512,00:30:32.63,00:30:32.63,IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. IT'S FOUR AGAINST THREE.

514,00:30:42.40,00:30:42.40,HAVE BEEN AROUND CAMP ARE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS DRIVING MY VOTE.

516,00:30:50.67,00:30:50.67,SHE'LL TELL SOMEBODY TO VOTE ONE WAY AND THEN SHE CHANGES HER
517,00:30:54.20,00:30:54.20,VOTE AT THE LAST MINUTE. AND THAT MAKES YOU NERVOUS AS
518,00:30:57.20,00:30:57.20,HELL AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME. SO WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO WORK
519,00:31:01.97,00:31:01.97,WITH JON AND JACLYN BECAUSE THEY'RE SWING VOTE.
520,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,NOW IT'S SCRAMBLE CITY. AND THEN SHE SWAPPED HER VOTE
521,00:31:15.20,00:31:15.20,"BACK TO NADIYA, SO ALL THE GIRLS VOTED FOR ME."
522,00:31:19.23,00:31:19.23,>> OH. >> SO SHE'S-- SO.

529,00:31:42.90,00:31:42.90,SIDE. IF THE WHOLE POINT IS TO CHOOSE
530,00:31:44.47,00:31:44.47,A PAIR AND THAT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME THEN I'M CHOOSING JON
531,00:31:48.07,00:31:48.07,AND JACLYN. MISSY AND BAYLOR ARE OUT.
532,00:31:50.17,00:31:50.17,">> NEW TRIBE, NEW GAME. WE START FROM SCRATCH NOW."

534,00:32:00.93,00:32:00.93,IT REALLY IS ALL ABOUT FINDING YOUR COUPLE THAT YOU MATCH UP
535,00:32:04.63,00:32:04.63,WITH. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO
536,00:32:06.33,00:32:06.33,BE ABLE TO READ A SITUATION AND BE ABLE TO SAY IS THIS THE BEST
537,00:32:10.43,00:32:10.43,THING FOR ME NOW? SO I'M LEAVING ROOM FOR MAKING
538,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,ADJUSTMENTS. >> DALE SEEMS TO WANT TO BE WITH
539,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,"YOU. >> YEAH, DALE DEFINITELY DOES."
540,00:32:21.70,00:32:21.70,>> DALE DOESN'T TRUST BAYLOR. >> BAYLOR OUT.
541,00:32:24.90,00:32:24.90,I DON'T KNOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO WE'RE CLOSE WITH HERE.
542,00:32:27.73,00:32:27.73,>> YEAH. >> WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S

546,00:32:40.57,00:32:40.57,SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU TWO HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME SIDE THE WHOLE

548,00:32:46.57,00:32:46.57,SUCKED BECAUSE I IN TO GO WITH THE GUYS.
549,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,SO IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST THE GIRL
550,00:32:50.80,00:32:50.80,WHICH WAS SO ANNOYING BECAUSE I LOVED YOU.
551,00:32:52.93,00:32:52.93,BUT I COULDN'T SAY ANYBODY EXWG TO JACLYN YET BECAUSE I WAS WITH

554,00:33:01.27,00:33:01.27,AND I NEVER REALLY WORKED TOGETHER ONE ON ONE.
555,00:33:04.20,00:33:04.20,SO THIS IS-- THIS IS A NEW BALLGAME WITH ME AND HER FOR
556,00:33:07.23,00:33:07.23,"SURE. SO, JACLYN, WHAT'S THE STORY"
557,00:33:08.90,00:33:08.90,WITH DALE AROUND HERE? WHAT'S THE VIBE?
