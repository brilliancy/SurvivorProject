1,00:00:01.30,00:00:01.30,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.30,00:00:03.30, Jaburu was divided
3,00:00:04.67,00:00:04.67, by differences in work ethic.
4,00:00:06.33,00:00:06.33,"Can we keep it clean, please?"
5,00:00:07.57,00:00:07.57,SHAWNA: They're just constantly trying
6,00:00:09.23,00:00:09.23,"to make everyone feel bad,like they're not doing enough."
7,00:00:11.33,00:00:11.33,"PROBST: And Heidi, Shawna and Jenna"
8,00:00:13.13,00:00:13.13, formed an alliance to protect themselves.
9,00:00:15.60,00:00:15.60,"If we could swingDeena's vote,"
10,00:00:17.00,00:00:17.00,"then it was, you know, game on."
11,00:00:18.43,00:00:18.43,HEIDI:I just need to know.
12,00:00:19.60,00:00:19.60,-Yes.-(shouting)
13,00:00:20.93,00:00:20.93,PROBST:The men won their first reward.
14,00:00:22.67,00:00:22.67,"Ah, yeah, boys!"
15,00:00:24.17,00:00:24.17,Tambaqui!
16,00:00:25.63,00:00:25.63,PROBST: Jaburu's loss sent them
17,00:00:27.27,00:00:27.27," -into a downward spiral. -Well, that sucked."
18,00:00:29.80,00:00:29.80,PROBST: And Shawna asked her tribe to vote her out.
19,00:00:32.43,00:00:32.43,I don't see myself lastingfor 30 more days.
20,00:00:35.43,00:00:35.43, PROBST: Tambaqui's fishing skills won them immunity.
21,00:00:37.80,00:00:37.80,"Tambaqui, congratulations."
22,00:00:39.70,00:00:39.70,And Jaburu was forced to choose
23,00:00:41.07,00:00:41.07, between protecting their alliance or Shawna's health.
24,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,"If Shawna wants to go first,are we putting her first"
25,00:00:47.07,00:00:47.07,-before Joanna?-No.
26,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,DEENA: It's about the core alliance.
27,00:00:50.03,00:00:50.03,"And suck it up, baby,"
28,00:00:51.17,00:00:51.17, 'cause you're along as long as we want you to.
29,00:00:53.97,00:00:53.97,"PROBST: Although Shawna chose not to vote with the alliance,"
30,00:00:56.40,00:00:56.40, they still forced her to stay in the game
31,00:00:58.50,00:00:58.50, by voting Joanna out of the tribe.
32,00:01:01.37,00:01:01.37,The tribe has spoken.
33,00:01:03.03,00:01:03.03, 12 are left.
34,00:01:04.97,00:01:04.97, Who will be voted out tonight?
35,00:02:26.80,00:02:26.80,"DEENA: With Joanna gone, I feel as if I am in control."
36,00:02:30.83,00:02:30.83, I am...
37,00:02:32.63,00:02:32.63,alpha female top dogright at this point in time.
38,00:02:37.13,00:02:37.13, But Jeanne is unbelievably pissed off.
39,00:02:39.83,00:02:39.83, I can't even begin to tell you how pissed off Jeanne is.
40,00:02:44.20,00:02:44.20,JEANNE: I was really in shock
41,00:02:45.57,00:02:45.57, when Joanna got voted off last night.
42,00:02:48.73,00:02:48.73, Shawna's such a liability. She needed to go.
43,00:02:51.47,00:02:51.47,She was crying.
44,00:02:52.63,00:02:52.63,"She was almost begging to go,"
45,00:02:54.77,00:02:54.77,and they votethe strongest person off.
46,00:02:57.43,00:02:57.43,Smart.
47,00:03:02.17,00:03:02.17,SHAWNA: It's truly ironic
48,00:03:03.97,00:03:03.97, that the people I set up my alliance with
49,00:03:06.10,00:03:06.10,are now trapping meinside the game
50,00:03:08.23,00:03:08.23, totally against my will.
51,00:03:10.33,00:03:10.33,"I'm just...I'm at the lowest of my low,"
52,00:03:12.90,00:03:12.90,and no one is respecting thefact that I am falling apart.
53,00:03:18.17,00:03:18.17,DEENA:Shawna's problem is 70% mental.
54,00:03:20.97,00:03:20.97,"We're not going to sacrificeourselves for her sake,"
55,00:03:23.97,00:03:23.97, so she might as well buck up and play with the rest of us.
56,00:03:45.77,00:03:45.77,ALEX: I think we're definitely
57,00:03:46.97,00:03:46.97, getting the hang of living out here.
58,00:03:48.43,00:03:48.43,"Like, I was thinkingabout it today."
59,00:03:50.00,00:03:50.00,We just tromp around out herelike it's our backyard.
60,00:03:53.93,00:03:53.93,"How you doing over there, Butch?"
61,00:03:55.47,00:03:55.47,I went through mine.
62,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,I'm almost through this thing.
63,00:04:05.03,00:04:05.03,Ow!
64,00:04:08.47,00:04:08.47,-All right?-Damn it.
65,00:04:09.47,00:04:09.47,Come on.
66,00:04:11.27,00:04:11.27,Banged myself in the forehead.
67,00:04:16.60,00:04:16.60,"Yeah, you got a cut."
68,00:04:18.17,00:04:18.17,Keep going.Clear right through.
69,00:04:20.03,00:04:20.03,What happened to you?

71,00:04:22.27,00:04:22.27,With the machete?
72,00:04:23.57,00:04:23.57,-Are you bleeding?-Yeah.
73,00:04:24.97,00:04:24.97,Go get a cold Coke.
74,00:04:26.40,00:04:26.40,I got it! I got it!
75,00:04:31.10,00:04:31.10,I don't want to bandage ittill I get the swell...
76,00:04:32.67,00:04:32.67,-make sure the swellinggoes down. -Yeah.
77,00:04:34.30,00:04:34.30,"-Thanks. -I really want to getsome iodine on there, you know?"
78,00:04:36.93,00:04:36.93,This will... Okay.
79,00:04:38.03,00:04:38.03,MATTHEW: I'm actually surprised
80,00:04:39.47,00:04:39.47, that an injury like this has not happened earlier.
81,00:04:41.93,00:04:41.93,No one here is reallythat experienced
82,00:04:43.77,00:04:43.77,"with, uh, workingwith a machete."
83,00:04:45.47,00:04:45.47," So he's lucky, since it's not very serious."
84,00:04:48.03,00:04:48.03,I'm going to pull your skin.Do you feel like
85,00:04:50.23,00:04:50.23,"-it's going togethera little bit? -Yeah, it's fine."
86,00:04:51.70,00:04:51.70,Fine.
87,00:04:52.73,00:04:52.73,"Not only does itlook functional, Alex,"
88,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,but it looks cool.
89,00:04:55.40,00:04:55.40,-Yeah.-It really does look cool.
90,00:04:57.50,00:04:57.50,-Yep.-Yeah.
91,00:04:58.60,00:04:58.60,"ALEX:Chicks dig scars, so, you know,"
92,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"maybe, uh... maybe that'llwork out for the best."
93,00:05:08.67,00:05:08.67,JEANNE: I just wantedto address every...
94,00:05:11.17,00:05:11.17,"everybody this morning,because of"
95,00:05:13.30,00:05:13.30,a conversationI overheard last night.
96,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,"You guys were talkingpretty loud,"
97,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77,and I didn't sleep at all.
98,00:05:18.13,00:05:18.13,I wasn't feeling too hot.
99,00:05:19.57,00:05:19.57,I heard Deena say your problem
100,00:05:22.90,00:05:22.90,was that you weren't partof the team.
101,00:05:24.83,00:05:24.83,If you think that I wasn't partof the team...
102,00:05:27.00,00:05:27.00,I was talking about her.
103,00:05:32.10,00:05:32.10,It didn't sound like that.
104,00:05:33.60,00:05:33.60,"DEENA:No, I was talking about"
105,00:05:35.20,00:05:35.20,Christy's attitudein the first three days.

110,00:05:45.80,00:05:45.80,"-I mean, you know you do a lot.-It's an atmosphere of paranoia."
111,00:05:48.63,00:05:48.63,I didn't knowwhat your plan was yesterday.

210,00:10:07.63,00:10:07.63,"DAVE: First thing we did was get out of the stinky,"
211,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70," sweaty clothes,put on the bath robes, and, uh,"

221,00:10:30.57,00:10:30.57,Though I know our tribeis pretty boring.
222,00:10:32.07,00:10:32.07,"See, we don't do a lotof talking, and I try"
223,00:10:34.10,00:10:34.10,"to tell the girls,I'm, like, you know what,"
224,00:10:35.80,00:10:35.80,"we should do, like,talk, like, every day"
225,00:10:37.07,00:10:37.07,just to be real.

227,00:10:40.30,00:10:40.30,"to someone of the opposite sex,we were, like, ready"
228,00:10:42.57,00:10:42.57,"to just, like, chat away."

232,00:10:50.47,00:10:50.47,And Shawna is falling apart.
233,00:10:52.37,00:10:52.37,She doesn't wanna be here;we just keep her on the tribe.
234,00:10:54.90,00:10:54.90, Jenna did go into great detail about the status of her tribe.
235,00:10:59.37,00:10:59.37," However, you got to think,"
236,00:11:01.77,00:11:01.77,do you want to berevealing all this
237,00:11:03.60,00:11:03.60,about... about your tribe?

243,00:11:12.07,00:11:12.07,"There's us,our four, against three."
244,00:11:14.80,00:11:14.80,Who would you have voted next?
245,00:11:16.13,00:11:16.13,"Uh, probably Jeanne."
246,00:11:17.57,00:11:17.57,Her attitude has really
247,00:11:19.13,00:11:19.13,gotten bad since Joanna's left.
248,00:11:21.60,00:11:21.60,"I'm telling you allthis stuff, but, oh, well."

257,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,"All of us, like,all the guys are really nice."
258,00:11:41.40,00:11:41.40,But it's crude.
259,00:11:42.77,00:11:42.77,Rob talks about Heidi's breasts.
260,00:11:45.27,00:11:45.27,We talk about your-your ass.
261,00:11:47.87,00:11:47.87,Mine?!

266,00:11:59.13,00:11:59.13," Went and took a shower, I had four walls."
267,00:12:02.20,00:12:02.20, The walls were made out of palm fronds.
268,00:12:05.00,00:12:05.00, They were semi-translucent.
269,00:12:07.10,00:12:07.10, But the water's clean.
270,00:12:09.23,00:12:09.23,"You know, it felt really goodjust to have something..."
271,00:12:11.00,00:12:11.00,something fall on my head.

286,00:12:47.83,00:12:47.83,"a better reward challenge,because we didn't have"
287,00:12:49.97,00:12:49.97,to do anything exceptjust be born in the right year.
288,00:12:53.03,00:12:53.03,JENNA:Oh... this is so funny.

295,00:13:26.90,00:13:26.90, and Jenna was fantastic to sleep next to.
296,00:13:29.90,00:13:29.90,She didn't kick;she didn't bite;
297,00:13:31.80,00:13:31.80,she didn't...

421,00:18:35.53,00:18:35.53,"I chose, strategy-wise,on how I thought"
422,00:18:38.73,00:18:38.73,the six of us were... would bestrongest to go into the merge.
423,00:18:43.17,00:18:43.17,-ROB: We taking our stuff?-You're taking

431,00:18:59.73,00:18:59.73, that my fate in this game would be determined by Dave.
432,00:19:02.37,00:19:02.37,I don't think he hasmy best interests at heart.
433,00:19:05.90,00:19:05.90,"Tambaqui at heart, fellas."
434,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50," He cares about himself, and, apparently,"
435,00:19:10.13,00:19:10.13, about Roger and about Butch.
436,00:19:11.73,00:19:11.73,I-I really hope it works out.
437,00:19:13.40,00:19:13.40,"It was kind of the, uh, thought"
438,00:19:14.70,00:19:14.70,-behind the whole thing.-Let me take a look at the map.
439,00:19:16.90,00:19:16.90,"-Good luck. I mean that. -Seeyou guys on the flip side, guys."
440,00:19:19.33,00:19:19.33,"-All right.-Hey, give me a hug."

446,00:19:37.60,00:19:37.60,"It was fun, until"
447,00:19:38.80,00:19:38.80,"a certain point,and then it didn't get fun."
448,00:19:40.97,00:19:40.97,-JEANNE: It was fun till what?-Three of you guys are going
449,00:19:43.80,00:19:43.80,"to Tambaqui,"
450,00:19:45.80,00:19:45.80,"and it's Heidi,Jeanne and Christy."
451,00:19:48.83,00:19:48.83,"HEIDI: Jenna and I are pretty buddy-buddy,"
452,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80, so when she came up and told the three of us...
453,00:19:53.67,00:19:53.67,"-It was, uh, we picked...-Oh, can I get a hug?"
454,00:19:55.53,00:19:55.53,"-they picked, we... -Can we geta group hug before we do this?"
455,00:19:57.97,00:19:57.97,I really couldn't...it was a shock to me.
456,00:20:00.70,00:20:00.70," So, I mean, it was kind of, like,"
457,00:20:02.37,00:20:02.37," ""Oh, man, that really stinks!"""
458,00:20:04.10,00:20:04.10,"-I love you.-I love you, too."

467,00:20:21.80,00:20:21.80," Obviously, I was feeling fine."
468,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,I was happy thatI was leaving that group.

507,00:22:05.23,00:22:05.23, in how well she is doing.
508,00:22:07.77,00:22:07.77,I never would have guessedthat she was deaf
509,00:22:10.10,00:22:10.10,by watching the other tribe.
510,00:22:12.47,00:22:12.47," -It's... it's amazing. -So, where you guys from?"

529,00:22:59.27,00:22:59.27, a little bit of testosterone can do for somebody.
530,00:23:02.00,00:23:02.00,"Boys come into the camp,and Shawna is..."
531,00:23:05.13,00:23:05.13,180 degrees better.

540,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,So I knew you were as excitedas I was to be here.

545,00:23:34.83,00:23:34.83," should Shawna and Jenna walk around here naked,"
546,00:23:37.13,00:23:37.13, I will promise them I will not cast a vote
547,00:23:39.67,00:23:39.67, in their direction until the merger.
548,00:24:00.67,00:24:00.67,"CHRISTY: That really shows that, yeah, man,"
549,00:24:02.93,00:24:02.93, I'm actually in a team
550,00:24:04.40,00:24:04.40,where... we're thinking
551,00:24:07.47,00:24:07.47,"on the same level--like, I think"
552,00:24:09.60,00:24:09.60,-we'll kick some butt. -The one thing
553,00:24:11.57,00:24:11.57, I like about this tribe is
554,00:24:13.63,00:24:13.63,"they're very aware that,okay, we got somebody who's deaf"
555,00:24:16.27,00:24:16.27,and they really tryto make sure I'm looking.
556,00:24:19.20,00:24:19.20,ROGER:Can you... can you see?
557,00:24:20.70,00:24:20.70,CHRISTY:I see Roger. I see Butch.
558,00:24:22.90,00:24:22.90,"-ROGER: Is that okay?-I think, yeah."
559,00:24:24.17,00:24:24.17,"BUTCH: You have to look at Christy,"
560,00:24:26.07,00:24:26.07, because she's deaf. I'm making
561,00:24:27.20,00:24:27.20, an extra effort to make sure
562,00:24:28.70,00:24:28.70,she knows what's going on.
563,00:24:30.20,00:24:30.20,"I'm making sure that she,you know, sees me."
564,00:24:32.63,00:24:32.63, At night we can make the lantern a little brighter.
565,00:24:35.30,00:24:35.30,"That way, she can read our lips"
566,00:24:36.93,00:24:36.93, and be included in the evening conversation
567,00:24:39.23,00:24:39.23,and make her feeleven more welcome.
568,00:24:42.57,00:24:42.57,"Guys, I mean, I'm justreally glad to be in a group"
569,00:24:45.13,00:24:45.13,"where this lanternis useful, you know?"
570,00:24:48.00,00:24:48.00,"In that Jaburu tribe,it was not even..."
571,00:24:50.63,00:24:50.63,it was never possible.
572,00:24:53.07,00:24:53.07,"So I really, you know...and me feeling comfortable,"
573,00:24:55.33,00:24:55.33,I will definitely do...put my 110% into this tribe.
574,00:24:59.57,00:24:59.57," It's just a really, uh... good feeling inside."
575,00:25:01.57,00:25:01.57," So knowing that I was in a really good group,"
576,00:25:04.50,00:25:04.50,I really appreciate that.
577,00:25:15.83,00:25:15.83,ALEX: See if you guys can guesswho got the most votes
578,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,for the hottest girl on...
579,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,on the old Jaburu tribe.
580,00:25:21.83,00:25:21.83,Jenna.
581,00:25:22.97,00:25:22.97,-My guess was Shawna.-ROB: You are correct.
582,00:25:24.63,00:25:24.63,-That is correct.-SHAWNA: Huh!
583,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,"-Shawna, you...-Shawna, Shawna took the..."
584,00:25:27.83,00:25:27.83,Shawna took it down.
585,00:25:29.57,00:25:29.57,SHAWNA: Alex is so fun.
586,00:25:31.53,00:25:31.53, I dig him so much.
587,00:25:33.20,00:25:33.20, He is adorable.
588,00:25:34.67,00:25:34.67,I dig his sense of humor.
589,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,"He's my type, you know?"
590,00:25:37.67,00:25:37.67,"MATTHEW: Yeah, I-I really likethe way the team came together."
591,00:25:39.90,00:25:39.90,"I mean, based on what we knowabout who we left behind."
592,00:25:42.33,00:25:42.33,ALEX:Yeah.
593,00:25:43.57,00:25:43.57,DEENA: I'm hurtin'.
594,00:25:45.03,00:25:45.03, Deena went from top to the bottom.
595,00:25:47.37,00:25:47.37,Shawna may not be so interestedin the chick thing anymore.
596,00:25:51.37,00:25:51.37,Shawna may be interestedin the Alex thing.
597,00:25:54.63,00:25:54.63, How loyal will she be to Jenna and myself?
598,00:25:59.47,00:25:59.47, Because clearly it should be the three women
599,00:26:01.73,00:26:01.73," against the three men, if we are going"

802,00:34:54.63,00:34:54.63,We wanted to beas fair as we can be.
803,00:34:57.10,00:34:57.10,"We figured that's probablywhat they're gonna do, too."
804,00:35:07.00,00:35:07.00,DAVE:Today was a pisser.
805,00:35:08.50,00:35:08.50,"HEIDI:Long, long pisser."
806,00:35:10.80,00:35:10.80, Dave and I went to go pick up some firewood.
807,00:35:13.33,00:35:13.33,"He just pulled me aside andhe's, like, ""Uh, you know,"
808,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"I-I definitely wantto talk to you about something."""
809,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33,"DAVE:Um, I picked you,"
810,00:35:19.77,00:35:19.77,because I want to carry youover into the merge.
811,00:35:24.10,00:35:24.10,"And I talked to Butch and Roger,and you're..."
812,00:35:28.00,00:35:28.00,"I mean, it's gonna bethe four of us."
813,00:35:29.70,00:35:29.70," And so he just told me, you know, ""I really want you to"
814,00:35:32.27,00:35:32.27,"try to be an alliance with theother three guys here,"" so..."
815,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17, It's just the conversation just all of a sudden
816,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50," came up, so that kind of caught me"
817,00:35:37.93,00:35:37.93," -off guard, actually. -Like, if you were"
818,00:35:39.30,00:35:39.30,"in my position, whatdo you think you would do?"
819,00:35:41.33,00:35:41.33,-I'd c... I'd come with us.-You would?
820,00:35:44.40,00:35:44.40,We're going with plan A.
821,00:35:46.00,00:35:46.00,Jeanne's gone tonight.
822,00:35:47.57,00:35:47.57,"-Oh, man. -Heidi needs to know"
823,00:35:49.47,00:35:49.47,that we plan on getting rid ofJeanne first and then Christy.
824,00:35:53.67,00:35:53.67, Jeanne was kind of next on the chopping block
825,00:35:56.23,00:35:56.23, for Jaburu.
826,00:35:57.70,00:35:57.70,"So I understand with my vote,I mean, definitely you guys"
827,00:36:00.33,00:36:00.33,are getting ahead.
828,00:36:01.77,00:36:01.77,"But if we lose the next two,you know I'm out of here."
829,00:36:05.07,00:36:05.07,-You know what I'm trying tosay? -I-I...
830,00:36:06.67,00:36:06.67,"-I won't bull ... you, you know?That's what it is. -I know."
831,00:36:08.63,00:36:08.63,I know it is.
832,00:36:10.47,00:36:10.47,HEIDI: I had a strong alliance with the girls before I came
833,00:36:13.47,00:36:13.47, into this tribe.
834,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83," It's kind of like, okay, now what do I do? I mean..."
835,00:36:18.67,00:36:18.67,I am really injust a rock and a hard stone.
836,00:36:21.27,00:36:21.27,"I mean, I am just right there."
837,00:36:22.73,00:36:22.73,"I am, like,the key factor right now"
838,00:36:24.60,00:36:24.60,to this wholevoting process tonight.
839,00:36:26.93,00:36:26.93,And I'm incrediblyuncomfortable with that.
840,00:37:01.93,00:37:01.93,Welcome to your first TribalCouncil as the new Tambaqui.
841,00:37:05.37,00:37:05.37,First thing I wantto know is reaction
842,00:37:07.37,00:37:07.37,to the switch of tribes.Jeanne?
843,00:37:09.37,00:37:09.37,"I was excited for a change,"
844,00:37:11.37,00:37:11.37,"I really was,and the gentlemen here,"
845,00:37:13.37,00:37:13.37,"they were gentlemen,they welcomed us."
846,00:37:15.87,00:37:15.87,"-It really was great.-Heidi,"
847,00:37:17.90,00:37:17.90,"what does that do to yourfeelings of the old Jaburu,"
848,00:37:20.90,00:37:20.90,the women thatare still on Jaburu?
849,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,"HEIDI:I adore Jenna,"
850,00:37:23.90,00:37:23.90,"so, I mean, I haveno hard feelings whatsoever."
851,00:37:26.90,00:37:26.90,She made the choice basedon what she had to go with.
852,00:37:29.07,00:37:29.07,I still love 'em all.
853,00:37:30.90,00:37:30.90,"I'm glad to be herejust as much, though."
854,00:37:33.07,00:37:33.07,"PROBST:Christy, how has"
855,00:37:34.43,00:37:34.43,your assimilationwith this new tribe been?
856,00:37:37.43,00:37:37.43,These guys handled itso much better
857,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,than the girls didwhen I joined their tribe.
858,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93,"They were awesome,and I just really appreciate it."
859,00:37:46.93,00:37:46.93,"You know, they really would trytheir best to look at me,"
860,00:37:50.03,00:37:50.03,and try their bestto really include me
861,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,and not feel likeI do have a disability.
862,00:37:54.47,00:37:54.47,"Which is just...oh, I'm so impressed."
863,00:37:57.97,00:37:57.97,PROBST:So what do you do now?
864,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,Somebody's going tonight.
865,00:38:01.57,00:38:01.57,"What's that gonna bebased on, Christy?"
866,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,Alliances.
867,00:38:05.07,00:38:05.07,PROBST:So do you...
868,00:38:06.93,00:38:06.93,"look at old alliancesand give them a value,"
869,00:38:09.50,00:38:09.50,"or do you say, you know,"
870,00:38:11.07,00:38:11.07,"""I can't, I'm in a new tribe""?"
871,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,"Well, it's hard, we've only..."
872,00:38:14.87,00:38:14.87,I met these guysa day and a half.
873,00:38:17.47,00:38:17.47,We didn't really have timeto really mingle.
874,00:38:19.93,00:38:19.93,"I don't know, it isa very hard decision,"
875,00:38:22.47,00:38:22.47,"and yes, it's on numbers,and I'd have to say alliance."
876,00:38:25.60,00:38:25.60,"You know, allianceis what I can depend on."
877,00:38:29.03,00:38:29.03,"PROBST:Well, alliances give both tribes"
878,00:38:31.10,00:38:31.10,a 50-50 chance of beingthe dominant faction tomorrow.
879,00:38:35.63,00:38:35.63,"-Right. -Right nowyou're even, three-three."
880,00:38:38.13,00:38:38.13,"Three women, three men."
881,00:38:39.87,00:38:39.87,"So, Roger,"
882,00:38:41.03,00:38:41.03,-how you vote?-It's a new day.
883,00:38:43.43,00:38:43.43,"I'm gonna vote, uh, who I thinkis the weakest, uh..."
884,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,weakest link to go on.
885,00:38:48.37,00:38:48.37,PROBST:So old alliances with
886,00:38:50.47,00:38:50.47,the men could be out thewindow-- if Butch is
887,00:38:52.17,00:38:52.17,"the weak guy,that's the way it goes."
888,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,Exactly.
889,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43,"Jeanne, how you voting?"
890,00:38:56.67,00:38:56.67,Weakest link.
891,00:38:58.47,00:38:58.47,And alliance.
892,00:39:01.23,00:39:01.23,And they both are the same?
893,00:39:02.67,00:39:02.67,Mm-hmm.
894,00:39:03.73,00:39:03.73,"Heidi, how are you voting?"
895,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,I'd say...
896,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,"I mean, yeah."
897,00:39:09.07,00:39:09.07,There are so many things runningthrough my head right now.
898,00:39:11.27,00:39:11.27,"-Give me one.-You know, I mean, it is"
899,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,"girls against guys, and thenat the same time we're a team."
900,00:39:17.07,00:39:17.07,That's justkilling me right now.
901,00:39:18.33,00:39:18.33,"Just, like, you know,head spinning. (laughs)"
902,00:39:21.40,00:39:21.40,"And, uh, it's killing me."
903,00:39:24.20,00:39:24.20,It is time to vote.
904,00:39:26.00,00:39:26.00,Butch.
905,00:40:48.23,00:40:48.23,I'll go tally the votes.
906,00:40:59.90,00:40:59.90,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
907,00:41:02.83,00:41:02.83,Person voted out'llbe asked to leave
908,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
909,00:41:05.90,00:41:05.90,I'll read the votes.
910,00:41:09.03,00:41:09.03,First vote...
911,00:41:11.83,00:41:11.83,...Jeanne.
912,00:41:16.73,00:41:16.73,"Butch. One vote-- Butch,one vote-- Jeanne."
913,00:41:26.43,00:41:26.43,Jeanne.That's two.
914,00:41:32.77,00:41:32.77,"That's two votes-- Butch,two votes-- Jeanne."
915,00:41:41.30,00:41:41.30,"Jeanne. That's three votes--Jeanne, two votes-- Butch."

918,00:41:53.33,00:41:53.33,Jeanne.
919,00:41:55.13,00:41:55.13,You need to bring me your torch.
920,00:42:10.00,00:42:10.00,"Jeanne, the tribe has spoken."
921,00:42:21.80,00:42:21.80,"So I guess the question is,"
922,00:42:25.13,00:42:25.13,"was tonight's vote basedon old tribal gender lines, or,"
923,00:42:30.37,00:42:30.37,"as you guys say, the weak linkin a new, big, happy tribe?"
924,00:42:34.63,00:42:34.63,Guess we'll find out.
925,00:42:35.90,00:42:35.90,You can head back to camp.Good night.
926,00:42:50.53,00:42:50.53,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

929,00:43:02.20,00:43:02.20," BUTCH: That smile on Christy's face, that's a moment, I'll"
930,00:43:04.20,00:43:04.20,never forget thatas long as I live.
931,00:43:05.53,00:43:05.53,"PROBST: And at Jaburu, Shawna's recovery"
932,00:43:07.90,00:43:07.90, is sparked by Alex.
933,00:43:09.10,00:43:09.10,SHAWNA: I definitely want
934,00:43:10.17,00:43:10.17,to get to know him better.
935,00:43:11.40,00:43:11.40," Like, he's an incredible person."
936,00:43:13.13,00:43:13.13,"At Jaburu,is there romance"
937,00:43:14.40,00:43:14.40, in the air? Maybe.
938,00:43:21.60,00:43:21.60,"I guess I wasn't madeto play this game, because..."
939,00:43:25.27,00:43:25.27," I didn't want to lie or cheat,"
940,00:43:27.40,00:43:27.40, and I know that's how I'm off right now.
941,00:43:29.47,00:43:29.47, I played a tough game-- I'm
942,00:43:31.07,00:43:31.07," tough, I'm mean, I'm focused"
943,00:43:32.63,00:43:32.63," I'm determined, but I guess"
944,00:43:34.07,00:43:34.07, I'm just not a nasty liar.
945,00:43:35.43,00:43:35.43, And that's really what you have to be.
946,00:43:37.43,00:43:37.43,"Good luck to them,because in the game of life,"
947,00:43:39.73,00:43:39.73,I'm the winner.
