1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.30,00:00:01.30,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.30,00:00:03.30, Jaburu was divided
4,00:00:04.67,00:00:04.67, by differences in work ethic.
5,00:00:06.33,00:00:06.33,"Can we keep it clean, please?"
6,00:00:07.57,00:00:07.57,SHAWNA:  They're just constantly trying
7,00:00:09.23,00:00:09.23,"to make everyone feel bad, like they're not doing enough."
8,00:00:11.33,00:00:11.33,"PROBST:  And Heidi, Shawna and Jenna"
9,00:00:13.13,00:00:13.13, formed an alliance  to protect themselves.
10,00:00:15.60,00:00:15.60,"If we could swing Deena's vote,"
11,00:00:17.00,00:00:17.00,"then it was, you know, game on."
12,00:00:18.43,00:00:18.43,HEIDI: I just need to know.
13,00:00:19.60,00:00:19.60,-Yes. -(shouting)
14,00:00:20.93,00:00:20.93,PROBST: The men won their first reward.
15,00:00:22.67,00:00:22.67,"Ah, yeah, boys!"
16,00:00:24.17,00:00:24.17,Tambaqui!
17,00:00:25.63,00:00:25.63,PROBST:  Jaburu's loss sent them
18,00:00:27.27,00:00:27.27," -into a downward spiral.  -Well, that sucked."
19,00:00:29.80,00:00:29.80,PROBST: And Shawna asked  her tribe to vote her out.
20,00:00:32.43,00:00:32.43,I don't see myself lasting for 30 more days.
21,00:00:35.43,00:00:35.43, PROBST: Tambaqui's fishing  skills won them immunity.
22,00:00:37.80,00:00:37.80,"Tambaqui, congratulations."
23,00:00:39.70,00:00:39.70,And Jaburu was forced to choose
24,00:00:41.07,00:00:41.07, between protecting their  alliance or Shawna's health.
25,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,"If Shawna wants to go first, are we putting her first"
26,00:00:47.07,00:00:47.07,-before Joanna? -No.
27,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,DEENA:  It's about the core alliance.
28,00:00:50.03,00:00:50.03,"And suck it up, baby,"
29,00:00:51.17,00:00:51.17, 'cause you're along  as long as we want you to.
30,00:00:53.97,00:00:53.97,"PROBST: Although Shawna chose  not to vote with the alliance,"
31,00:00:56.40,00:00:56.40, they still forced her  to stay in the game
32,00:00:58.50,00:00:58.50, by voting Joanna  out of the tribe.
33,00:01:01.37,00:01:01.37,The tribe has spoken.
34,00:01:03.03,00:01:03.03, 12 are left.
35,00:01:04.97,00:01:04.97, Who will be voted out tonight?
36,00:02:26.80,00:02:26.80,"DEENA: With Joanna gone,  I feel as if I am in control."
37,00:02:30.83,00:02:30.83, I am...
38,00:02:32.63,00:02:32.63,alpha female top dog right at this point in time.
39,00:02:37.13,00:02:37.13, But Jeanne  is unbelievably pissed off.
40,00:02:39.83,00:02:39.83, I can't even begin to tell you  how pissed off Jeanne is.
41,00:02:44.20,00:02:44.20,JEANNE:  I was really in shock
42,00:02:45.57,00:02:45.57, when Joanna  got voted off last night.
43,00:02:48.73,00:02:48.73, Shawna's such a liability.  She needed to go.
44,00:02:51.47,00:02:51.47,She was crying.
45,00:02:52.63,00:02:52.63,"She was almost begging to go,"
46,00:02:54.77,00:02:54.77,and they vote the strongest person off.
47,00:02:57.43,00:02:57.43,Smart.
48,00:03:02.17,00:03:02.17,SHAWNA:  It's truly ironic
49,00:03:03.97,00:03:03.97, that the people  I set up my alliance with
50,00:03:06.10,00:03:06.10,are now trapping me inside the game
51,00:03:08.23,00:03:08.23, totally against my will.
52,00:03:10.33,00:03:10.33,"I'm just... I'm at the lowest of my low,"
53,00:03:12.90,00:03:12.90,and no one is respecting the fact that I am falling apart.
54,00:03:18.17,00:03:18.17,DEENA: Shawna's problem is 70% mental.
55,00:03:20.97,00:03:20.97,"We're not going to sacrifice ourselves for her sake,"
56,00:03:23.97,00:03:23.97, so she might as well buck up  and play with the rest of us.
57,00:03:45.77,00:03:45.77,ALEX:  I think we're definitely
58,00:03:46.97,00:03:46.97, getting the hang  of living out here.
59,00:03:48.43,00:03:48.43,"Like, I was thinking about it today."
60,00:03:50.00,00:03:50.00,We just tromp around out here like it's our backyard.
61,00:03:53.93,00:03:53.93,"How you doing over there, Butch?"
62,00:03:55.47,00:03:55.47,I went through mine.
63,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,I'm almost through this thing.
64,00:04:05.03,00:04:05.03,Ow!
65,00:04:08.47,00:04:08.47,-All right? -Damn it.
66,00:04:09.47,00:04:09.47,Come on.
67,00:04:11.27,00:04:11.27,Banged myself in the forehead.
68,00:04:16.60,00:04:16.60,"Yeah, you got a cut."
69,00:04:18.17,00:04:18.17,Keep going. Clear right through.
70,00:04:20.03,00:04:20.03,What happened to you?
71,00:04:21.10,00:04:21.10,Banged myself in the head.
72,00:04:22.27,00:04:22.27,With the machete?
73,00:04:23.57,00:04:23.57,-Are you bleeding? -Yeah.
74,00:04:24.97,00:04:24.97,Go get a cold Coke.
75,00:04:26.40,00:04:26.40,I got it! I got it!
76,00:04:31.10,00:04:31.10,I don't want to bandage it till I get the swell...
77,00:04:32.67,00:04:32.67,-make sure the swelling goes down. -Yeah.
78,00:04:34.30,00:04:34.30,"-Thanks. -I really want to get some iodine on there, you know?"
79,00:04:36.93,00:04:36.93,This will... Okay.
80,00:04:38.03,00:04:38.03,MATTHEW:  I'm actually surprised
81,00:04:39.47,00:04:39.47, that an injury like this  has not happened earlier.
82,00:04:41.93,00:04:41.93,No one here is really that experienced
83,00:04:43.77,00:04:43.77,"with, uh, working with a machete."
84,00:04:45.47,00:04:45.47," So he's lucky,  since it's not very serious."
85,00:04:48.03,00:04:48.03,I'm going to pull your skin. Do you feel like
86,00:04:50.23,00:04:50.23,"-it's going together a little bit? -Yeah, it's fine."
87,00:04:51.70,00:04:51.70,Fine.
88,00:04:52.73,00:04:52.73,"Not only does it look functional, Alex,"
89,00:04:54.17,00:04:54.17,but it looks cool.
90,00:04:55.40,00:04:55.40,-Yeah. -It really does look cool.
91,00:04:57.50,00:04:57.50,-Yep. -Yeah.
92,00:04:58.60,00:04:58.60,"ALEX: Chicks dig scars, so, you know,"
93,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"maybe, uh... maybe that'll work out for the best."
94,00:05:08.67,00:05:08.67,JEANNE: I just wanted to address every...
95,00:05:11.17,00:05:11.17,"everybody this morning, because of"
96,00:05:13.30,00:05:13.30,a conversation I overheard last night.
97,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33,"You guys were talking pretty loud,"
98,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77,and I didn't sleep at all.
99,00:05:18.13,00:05:18.13,I wasn't feeling too hot.
100,00:05:19.57,00:05:19.57,I heard Deena say your problem
101,00:05:22.90,00:05:22.90,was that you weren't part of the team.
102,00:05:24.83,00:05:24.83,If you think that I wasn't part of the team...
103,00:05:27.00,00:05:27.00,I was talking about her.
104,00:05:32.10,00:05:32.10,It didn't sound like that.
105,00:05:33.60,00:05:33.60,"DEENA: No, I was talking about"
106,00:05:35.20,00:05:35.20,Christy's attitude in the first three days.
107,00:05:37.93,00:05:37.93,-Is something else bothering you? -JEANNE: No.
108,00:05:40.80,00:05:40.80,No.
109,00:05:42.37,00:05:42.37,-This is a big deal. -I don't see why you would even think
110,00:05:44.10,00:05:44.10,you... we wouldn't think you were part... You do so much.
111,00:05:45.80,00:05:45.80,"-I mean, you know you do a lot. -It's an atmosphere of paranoia."
112,00:05:48.63,00:05:48.63,I didn't know what your plan was yesterday.
113,00:05:51.30,00:05:51.30,"-No one, you know... -DEENA: There was some"
114,00:05:52.83,00:05:52.83,"personality differences, and we all want to feel like"
115,00:05:55.63,00:05:55.63,"-we're unified. -Well, I feel like you guys"
116,00:05:57.67,00:05:57.67,"are unified, 'cause you guys hang here"
117,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,and I... I'm always out there.
118,00:06:01.63,00:06:01.63,"So I'm gonna stay here today,"
119,00:06:03.17,00:06:03.17,"near the fire, and let you guys go out there."
120,00:06:05.33,00:06:05.33,I... and... have at it.
121,00:06:07.90,00:06:07.90,-Okay. -Because I'm sick and tired of the damn thing.
122,00:06:09.70,00:06:09.70,Okay.
123,00:06:11.07,00:06:11.07,-Have it. -Cool.
124,00:06:13.80,00:06:13.80,DEENA: Jeanne is sweating  in her panties.
125,00:06:15.53,00:06:15.53," She's thinking,"
126,00:06:17.60,00:06:17.60,"""God help me, what am I going to do?"""
127,00:06:20.70,00:06:20.70,Cool.
128,00:06:35.53,00:06:35.53,"I have a feeling this is, like, Pandora's Box."
129,00:06:38.10,00:06:38.10,-Ooh... -Ooh...
130,00:06:40.03,00:06:40.03,Vino!
131,00:06:41.70,00:06:41.70,"-Okay, cats. -Hey, hey, sports fans."
132,00:06:45.33,00:06:45.33,"ROB: ""Prepare to have"
133,00:06:47.23,00:06:47.23,"""a little fun,"
134,00:06:48.83,00:06:48.83,"""unfortunately, for only one."
135,00:06:52.00,00:06:52.00,"""The map will show you the place you're after."
136,00:06:54.60,00:06:54.60,"Send your youngest for wine and laughter."""
137,00:06:58.60,00:06:58.60,"DAVE: Hey, hey, we got a map."
138,00:07:01.03,00:07:01.03,"-So, who's going? -Who's our youngest?"
139,00:07:02.70,00:07:02.70,-Who's our youngest? -Who's our youngest?
140,00:07:04.13,00:07:04.13,-Dave! -Yeah!
141,00:07:05.13,00:07:05.13,I wish I had voted Dave out of here on day one.
142,00:07:07.97,00:07:07.97,"ROB:  I was very upset, because..."
143,00:07:10.60,00:07:10.60,I wanted to go for wine and laughter.
144,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77, I'm just very annoyed
145,00:07:15.60,00:07:15.60, that the golden boy Dave falls  face-first into good luck.
146,00:07:19.77,00:07:19.77,"-Prepare to have a little fun. -DAVE: Well, I better go"
147,00:07:21.87,00:07:21.87,"get showered and, uh, lathered up, baby."
148,00:07:30.10,00:07:30.10,"JEANNE: ""...only one."
149,00:07:31.77,00:07:31.77,"""The map will show the place you're after."
150,00:07:34.03,00:07:34.03,"""Send your youngest for wine"
151,00:07:35.17,00:07:35.17,"and laughter."""
152,00:07:36.47,00:07:36.47,No way! Is that just Jenna's going?
153,00:07:38.17,00:07:38.17,"DEENA: Get ready, baby."
154,00:07:39.30,00:07:39.30,JENNA: And it said  only one person can go
155,00:07:42.07,00:07:42.07,"and send your youngest, and immediately I was, like, oh,"
156,00:07:44.33,00:07:44.33,"I'm the youngest, so I'm gonna have to do something by myself."
157,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,Don't assume youngest means age.
158,00:07:50.07,00:07:50.07,"What do you think, we age differently, like cheese?"
159,00:07:52.60,00:07:52.60,"-Could be youngest at heart. -JENNA: And I was, like,"
160,00:07:54.77,00:07:54.77,"youngest means youngest-- come on, now."
161,00:07:56.13,00:07:56.13,I'm the youngest; give it a break.
162,00:07:57.77,00:07:57.77,"I'm going somewhere, and you're not."
163,00:07:59.23,00:07:59.23,"-Good luck. -Have fun. -Thank you. Bye, guys."
164,00:08:01.30,00:08:01.30,"-Bye. -Take care. -Rock on, Jenna!"
165,00:08:26.40,00:08:26.40,"Come on in, guys."
166,00:08:27.47,00:08:27.47,Paddle in as close as you can get.
167,00:08:29.67,00:08:29.67,"DAVE: After quite  a long paddle, ended up"
168,00:08:32.47,00:08:32.47, at this fantastic  bungalow with Jenna.
169,00:08:36.83,00:08:36.83," We paddled up together,"
170,00:08:38.20,00:08:38.20,"a little apprehensive, uh, curious."
171,00:08:41.47,00:08:41.47,"-Welcome, guys. -DAVE: Hello."
172,00:08:43.73,00:08:43.73,"-You know each other, right? -Right."
173,00:08:45.20,00:08:45.20,"13 days, you've been"
174,00:08:46.63,00:08:46.63,out here in the Amazon jungle.
175,00:08:48.00,00:08:48.00,-That's right. -Separated from
176,00:08:49.23,00:08:49.23,day one into tribes of men and women
177,00:08:51.33,00:08:51.33,with no tribal interaction outside of challenges.
178,00:08:54.03,00:08:54.03,"You know, in the Amazon the local Indians"
179,00:08:56.00,00:08:56.00,"have a saying: History belongs to the old men,"
180,00:08:58.70,00:08:58.70,"the village belongs to the adults,"
181,00:09:00.90,00:09:00.90,but opportunity is for the young.
182,00:09:03.47,00:09:03.47,"So we thought, maybe it's about time"
183,00:09:05.13,00:09:05.13,"we had an official ""get to know you."""
184,00:09:07.90,00:09:07.90,-Yeah. -Based on age--
185,00:09:09.03,00:09:09.03,you are both the youngest-- you were selected.
186,00:09:11.47,00:09:11.47,You may view this as a break
187,00:09:13.93,00:09:13.93,from the tribes;
188,00:09:15.07,00:09:15.07,you may view it as a strategic opportunity.
189,00:09:18.07,00:09:18.07,That is up to you guys.
190,00:09:20.53,00:09:20.53,You will have plenty of food...
191,00:09:22.20,00:09:22.20,-Oh! -Oh! -(both laughing)
192,00:09:24.07,00:09:24.07,"...couple of bottles of wine,"
193,00:09:25.90,00:09:25.90, outdoor shower with fresh  water.
194,00:09:28.73,00:09:28.73," We've got towels, slippers,"
195,00:09:31.07,00:09:31.07,"robes, and of course, a beautiful"
196,00:09:33.40,00:09:33.40," and very, very soft bed..."
197,00:09:35.47,00:09:35.47,-We're staying here? -...with clean sheets.
198,00:09:36.80,00:09:36.80,-For the night? -You're staying here tonight.
199,00:09:38.47,00:09:38.47,"-Oh, yes! -Very nice! -Your casa..."
200,00:09:40.63,00:09:40.63,-awaits. -Thank you very much. -Yay!
201,00:09:42.13,00:09:42.13,"-Thank you. -Have a good time, guys."
202,00:09:43.57,00:09:43.57,Will do.
203,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10,All right!
204,00:09:53.53,00:09:53.53,"-Oh, my God! -(laughs)"
205,00:09:55.17,00:09:55.17,"JENNA: It was, like,  our own little, like, private"
206,00:09:57.47,00:09:57.47,"bungalow for two in the middle of, like, this gorgeous jungle,"
207,00:10:00.10,00:10:00.10," and I was, like,"
208,00:10:02.10,00:10:02.10,"""You've got to be crapping me,"" because..."
209,00:10:04.80,00:10:04.80," it's, like, sensory overload."
210,00:10:05.80,00:10:05.80,"Oh, shoes off."
211,00:10:07.63,00:10:07.63,"DAVE: First thing we did  was get out of the stinky,"
212,00:10:10.70,00:10:10.70," sweaty clothes, put on the bath robes, and, uh,"
213,00:10:13.57,00:10:13.57,we both sat down and started eating grapes and drinking wine
214,00:10:18.17,00:10:18.17,and eating cheese and cra...
215,00:10:20.33,00:10:20.33,It was... it was heaven.
216,00:10:21.60,00:10:21.60,It was... it was heaven in the Amazon.
217,00:10:23.43,00:10:23.43,-Cheers. -Cheers.
218,00:10:24.53,00:10:24.53,Okay.
219,00:10:25.37,00:10:25.37,"So, yeah, so Jaburu life's"
220,00:10:27.90,00:10:27.90,"-going well? -Um, it's good."
221,00:10:29.30,00:10:29.30,-Mm-hmm. -It's good.
222,00:10:30.57,00:10:30.57,Though I know our tribe is pretty boring.
223,00:10:32.07,00:10:32.07,"See, we don't do a lot of talking, and I try"
224,00:10:34.10,00:10:34.10,"to tell the girls, I'm, like, you know what,"
225,00:10:35.80,00:10:35.80,"we should do, like, talk, like, every day"
226,00:10:37.07,00:10:37.07,just to be real.
227,00:10:38.33,00:10:38.33,JENNA: We were so excited  to actually talk
228,00:10:40.30,00:10:40.30,"to someone of the opposite sex, we were, like, ready"
229,00:10:42.57,00:10:42.57,"to just, like, chat away."
230,00:10:44.87,00:10:44.87,"Heidi, who I've become really close to..."
231,00:10:47.37,00:10:47.37,"-I expected that. -She's, like,"
232,00:10:48.90,00:10:48.90,"really, really upbeat all the time."
233,00:10:50.47,00:10:50.47,And Shawna is falling apart.
234,00:10:52.37,00:10:52.37,She doesn't wanna be here; we just keep her on the tribe.
235,00:10:54.90,00:10:54.90, Jenna did go into great detail  about the status of her tribe.
236,00:10:59.37,00:10:59.37," However, you got to think,"
237,00:11:01.77,00:11:01.77,do you want to be revealing all this
238,00:11:03.60,00:11:03.60,about... about your tribe?
239,00:11:05.30,00:11:05.30,"So I approached Heidi, I was, like,"
240,00:11:06.60,00:11:06.60,"we need to stick together,"
241,00:11:07.63,00:11:07.63,"the younger people, and we"
242,00:11:08.93,00:11:08.93,"approached Shawna, said we need to stick together."
243,00:11:10.67,00:11:10.67,Shawna approached Deena.
244,00:11:12.07,00:11:12.07,"There's us, our four, against three."
245,00:11:14.80,00:11:14.80,Who would you have voted next?
246,00:11:16.13,00:11:16.13,"Uh, probably Jeanne."
247,00:11:17.57,00:11:17.57,Her attitude has really
248,00:11:19.13,00:11:19.13,gotten bad since Joanna's left.
249,00:11:21.60,00:11:21.60,"I'm telling you all this stuff, but, oh, well."
250,00:11:24.13,00:11:24.13,"DAVE: I'll give you a rundown of our tribe. Roger,"
251,00:11:26.60,00:11:26.60,he's a kind of engineer.
252,00:11:28.00,00:11:28.00,He's 56.
253,00:11:29.17,00:11:29.17,Alex is 33.
254,00:11:31.67,00:11:31.67,-Wow. -He is
255,00:11:33.00,00:11:33.00,a triathlon coach out of Los Angeles...
256,00:11:35.60,00:11:35.60,"(fading): and, uh..."
257,00:11:37.13,00:11:37.13,"We, uh... we have a good time."
258,00:11:39.33,00:11:39.33,"All of us, like, all the guys are really nice."
259,00:11:41.40,00:11:41.40,But it's crude.
260,00:11:42.77,00:11:42.77,Rob talks about Heidi's breasts.
261,00:11:45.27,00:11:45.27,We talk about your-your ass.
262,00:11:47.87,00:11:47.87,Mine?!
263,00:11:49.13,00:11:49.13,-Barely even there. -You have a sexy ass.
264,00:11:50.63,00:11:50.63,"(laughs): Oh, God!"
265,00:11:51.70,00:11:51.70,"You have a sexy ass, so we talk about your sexy ass."
266,00:11:57.87,00:11:57.87,Oh... ah...
267,00:11:59.13,00:11:59.13," Went and took a shower,  I had four walls."
268,00:12:02.20,00:12:02.20, The walls were made  out of palm fronds.
269,00:12:05.00,00:12:05.00, They were semi-translucent.
270,00:12:07.10,00:12:07.10, But the water's clean.
271,00:12:09.23,00:12:09.23,"You know, it felt really good just to have something..."
272,00:12:11.00,00:12:11.00,something fall on my head.
273,00:12:12.30,00:12:12.30,"You didn't wear shoes, did you?"
274,00:12:13.87,00:12:13.87,"-No, I didn't.  -Jenna took a shower"
275,00:12:15.67,00:12:15.67, after I took a shower.
276,00:12:17.27,00:12:17.27,"See, you're gonna be able to see my, like, boobs. (laughs)"
277,00:12:21.10,00:12:21.10,"DAVE: So, there's a naked girl  in the shower that"
278,00:12:23.50,00:12:23.50," you can see into,  and I'm standing"
279,00:12:25.70,00:12:25.70," on the other side of camp  brushing my teeth, thinking"
280,00:12:28.20,00:12:28.20,that this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
281,00:12:34.70,00:12:34.70,-JENNA: Very cool. -Are you a snorer?
282,00:12:36.77,00:12:36.77,I don't know. Do you snore?
283,00:12:38.43,00:12:38.43,"DAVE: I twitch for, like..."
284,00:12:40.10,00:12:40.10,-right before I fall asleep. -(laughing)
285,00:12:42.57,00:12:42.57,"JENNA: We got to sleep  in a bed, which was"
286,00:12:46.23,00:12:46.23,so refreshing. It couldn't have been
287,00:12:47.83,00:12:47.83,"a better reward challenge, because we didn't have"
288,00:12:49.97,00:12:49.97,to do anything except just be born in the right year.
289,00:12:53.03,00:12:53.03,JENNA: Oh... this is so funny.
290,00:12:55.47,00:12:55.47,-DAVE: This is classic. -(laughs)
291,00:13:12.70,00:13:12.70,"(birds chirping, insects chittering)"
292,00:13:20.77,00:13:20.77,-(Dave groans) -JENNA: Good morning.
293,00:13:23.10,00:13:23.10,DAVE: Morning.
294,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50,That was nice.
295,00:13:25.63,00:13:25.63,"DAVE:  I slept so well,"
296,00:13:26.90,00:13:26.90, and Jenna was fantastic  to sleep next to.
297,00:13:29.90,00:13:29.90,She didn't kick; she didn't bite;
298,00:13:31.80,00:13:31.80,she didn't...
299,00:13:33.63,00:13:33.63,snore.
300,00:13:36.00,00:13:36.00,"DAVE: Oh, my God."
301,00:13:38.03,00:13:38.03,"Jenna, you are gonna die"
302,00:13:39.47,00:13:39.47,when you see this food out here right now.
303,00:13:41.87,00:13:41.87,There's more?
304,00:13:43.30,00:13:43.30,We're eating it in bed.
305,00:13:45.27,00:13:45.27,"Oh, wow!"
306,00:13:46.90,00:13:46.90,"JENNA: There was,  like, fruit juice there,"
307,00:13:49.47,00:13:49.47," crescent rolls, breads,"
308,00:13:50.93,00:13:50.93," Danish-type bread,"
309,00:13:52.27,00:13:52.27," fruit, bananas."
310,00:13:55.40,00:13:55.40,It was so great.
311,00:13:56.50,00:13:56.50,This is just bitchin'.
312,00:13:58.30,00:13:58.30,I'm gonna fall asleep.
313,00:13:59.77,00:13:59.77,JENNA: Uh-oh.
314,00:14:01.40,00:14:01.40,Good morning.
315,00:14:03.50,00:14:03.50,-Morning. -Look at this scene.
316,00:14:05.27,00:14:05.27,"Oh, my."
317,00:14:06.50,00:14:06.50,-We had fun. We really... -Yeah? -Uh-huh.
318,00:14:08.60,00:14:08.60,And we didn't... we didn't hold back anything.
319,00:14:10.87,00:14:10.87,We told it all.
320,00:14:12.63,00:14:12.63,We pretty much know everything about each other's
321,00:14:14.33,00:14:14.33,-tribes now. -Good.
322,00:14:15.30,00:14:15.30,Plant it down here.
323,00:14:16.57,00:14:16.57,"Grab a pillow. Boom, here and here."
324,00:14:17.77,00:14:17.77,"Just a little more business to take care of, that's all."
325,00:14:19.97,00:14:19.97,-We'll be out of here. -Oh...
326,00:14:21.47,00:14:21.47,"JENNA:  And then he said, okay,"
327,00:14:22.90,00:14:22.90," take a seat at the table,  and I was, like,"
328,00:14:25.23,00:14:25.23,"aw, man, take a seat at the table--"
329,00:14:27.03,00:14:27.03,"I was, like, that means this isn't even over yet."
330,00:14:29.33,00:14:29.33,"Well, I am glad to hear that you guys"
331,00:14:31.23,00:14:31.23,shared a little bit of information.
332,00:14:32.77,00:14:32.77,"That information's gonna come in real handy,"
333,00:14:34.40,00:14:34.40,'cause the game's about to take a turn.
334,00:14:37.07,00:14:37.07,"We're gonna have a little draft,"
335,00:14:38.87,00:14:38.87,and you two are in charge of picking new tribes.
336,00:14:45.50,00:14:45.50,"So, here's how it's gonna work."
337,00:14:48.47,00:14:48.47,You two will alternate in your choices
338,00:14:50.50,00:14:50.50,"and you'll begin with a member of the opposite sex,"
339,00:14:53.00,00:14:53.00,"and then you'll go man, woman, man, woman."
340,00:14:54.87,00:14:54.87,So it really doesn't matter who goes first. Anybody want to?
341,00:14:57.13,00:14:57.13,You go first.
342,00:14:58.37,00:14:58.37,"Dave, make your first choice: it's a woman."
343,00:15:02.77,00:15:02.77,DAVE:  I think she regretted saying
344,00:15:05.47,00:15:05.47,a lot of the information she did.
345,00:15:07.20,00:15:07.20, Jenna had talked a lot  about her alliance with Heidi
346,00:15:10.90,00:15:10.90, and how strong Heidi was.
347,00:15:13.13,00:15:13.13,You know...
348,00:15:14.57,00:15:14.57,"-Oh, God, don't screw me... -I..."
349,00:15:16.40,00:15:16.40,"I've only heard good things about Heidi,"
350,00:15:18.37,00:15:18.37,"-and, uh... -Oh, God, no."
351,00:15:20.13,00:15:20.13,-So... -PROBST: Heidi.
352,00:15:22.23,00:15:22.23,First member of Tambaqui.
353,00:15:24.30,00:15:24.30,"-Sorry. -Killing me, you're killing me."
354,00:15:26.03,00:15:26.03," Aw, man, I hurt hard when he took her because she was, like,"
355,00:15:29.47,00:15:29.47,"my rock here, and I don't know what I'm gonna do without her."
356,00:15:31.33,00:15:31.33,"Like, when she... she... Ooh, it almost made me want to cry."
357,00:15:33.97,00:15:33.97,"Jenna, who's the first guy?"
358,00:15:38.03,00:15:38.03,"Um, I'm gonna have to pull Alex,"
359,00:15:40.10,00:15:40.10,because of his athletic ability and stamina.
360,00:15:44.47,00:15:44.47,PROBST: Alex now a member of Jaburu.
361,00:15:47.03,00:15:47.03,"All right, Dave, now you're picking a guy."
362,00:15:51.77,00:15:51.77,-Butch. -So you're gonna keep Butch
363,00:15:53.80,00:15:53.80,-on Tambaqui. -I'm keeping Butch.
364,00:15:54.80,00:15:54.80,Jenna.
365,00:15:55.87,00:15:55.87,Deena. Deena by far.
366,00:15:57.47,00:15:57.47,-PROBST: Deena stays on Jaburu. -Yeah.
367,00:15:59.30,00:15:59.30,Dave.
368,00:16:00.27,00:16:00.27,Picking a woman.
369,00:16:04.83,00:16:04.83,I'm gonna take Christy.
370,00:16:06.10,00:16:06.10,PROBST: Christy now a member of Tambaqui.
371,00:16:08.93,00:16:08.93,"Pick another guy, Jenna."
372,00:16:12.33,00:16:12.33,I'm gonna have to go for Rob.
373,00:16:14.83,00:16:14.83,PROBST: Rob now a member of Jaburu.
374,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,"-Dave, pick a guy. -Um..."
375,00:16:20.17,00:16:20.17,I'm gonna take Roger.
376,00:16:21.33,00:16:21.33,PROBST: Roger stays on Tambaqui.
377,00:16:22.60,00:16:22.60,I'm gonna take Shawna.
378,00:16:24.27,00:16:24.27,PROBST: Shawna stays with Jaburu.
379,00:16:25.70,00:16:25.70,Last two choices
380,00:16:27.00,00:16:27.00,are already made.
381,00:16:28.20,00:16:28.20,-You got Jeanne... -JENNA (whispers): Matthew.
382,00:16:30.20,00:16:30.20,and Matthew becomes a member of Jaburu.
383,00:16:33.33,00:16:33.33,"So, those are our new tribes."
384,00:16:36.87,00:16:36.87,"JENNA:  So, that was it, new tribes,"
385,00:16:38.43,00:16:38.43,"as easy as that, in ten minutes. (laughs)"
386,00:16:41.53,00:16:41.53, It's just like  the game started again.
387,00:16:43.77,00:16:43.77," -It's like a brand-new game.  -PROBST: Jenna,"
388,00:16:45.60,00:16:45.60,three new buffs.

390,00:16:49.93,00:16:49.93, -Let's go.  -...and said
391,00:16:51.70,00:16:51.70,we had to paddle back and...
392,00:16:53.63,00:16:53.63,"tell everybody,"
393,00:16:54.97,00:16:54.97, and away they go.

403,00:17:45.50,00:17:45.50,He brought the map back.
404,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,All right.
405,00:17:49.33,00:17:49.33,"Woke up early this morning, I had... had some food,"
406,00:17:53.00,00:17:53.00,"thought of you guys, raised a toast and all that stuff."
407,00:17:55.33,00:17:55.33,"Jeff came in, and he dumps out all these chips on the table"
408,00:17:58.67,00:17:58.67,with names of all the tribe members.
409,00:18:01.90,00:18:01.90,So we have new tribes.
410,00:18:06.27,00:18:06.27,Um...
411,00:18:07.43,00:18:07.43,"with that being said, I picked..."
412,00:18:10.77,00:18:10.77,"Butch and Roger staying here with me, and..."
413,00:18:14.00,00:18:14.00,"Alex, Rob and Matt are going to Jenna's tribe."
414,00:18:17.20,00:18:17.20,"ROB:  So he's, like, ""Well,"
415,00:18:19.10,00:18:19.10," ""let me tell you guys this:"
416,00:18:20.77,00:18:20.77," ""I completely was true to us,"
417,00:18:23.33,00:18:23.33,"""and I completely took advantage of Jenna."
418,00:18:25.33,00:18:25.33,"""Oh, by the way, Rob, Alex and Matt,"
419,00:18:28.23,00:18:28.23,"""you're gonna go live with... you're gonna go to Jenna's camp"
420,00:18:30.57,00:18:30.57," ""with Shawna and Deena,  and a bunch of other girls"
421,00:18:33.27,00:18:33.27," are gonna stay here  with me, Butch and Roger."""
422,00:18:35.53,00:18:35.53,"I chose, strategy-wise, on how I thought"
423,00:18:38.73,00:18:38.73,the six of us were... would be strongest to go into the merge.
424,00:18:43.17,00:18:43.17,-ROB: We taking our stuff? -You're taking
425,00:18:44.57,00:18:44.57,your stuff and your luxury item.
426,00:18:45.97,00:18:45.97,"-Okay, guys. Here. -The chicks coming..."
427,00:18:47.57,00:18:47.57,"-The chicks coming here? -Roger, take care. See you soon."
428,00:18:50.83,00:18:50.83,"DAVE: And, uh, we'll tag up with you guys"
429,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,tomorrow at the immunity challenge.
430,00:18:54.77,00:18:54.77,-We're good. -Whup your ass.
431,00:18:57.43,00:18:57.43,ROB: I was very mad  when I found out
432,00:18:59.73,00:18:59.73, that my fate in this game  would be determined by Dave.
433,00:19:02.37,00:19:02.37,I don't think he has my best interests at heart.
434,00:19:05.90,00:19:05.90,"Tambaqui at heart, fellas."
435,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50," He cares about himself,  and, apparently,"
436,00:19:10.13,00:19:10.13, about Roger and about Butch.
437,00:19:11.73,00:19:11.73,I-I really hope it works out.
438,00:19:13.40,00:19:13.40,"It was kind of the, uh, thought"
439,00:19:14.70,00:19:14.70,-behind the whole thing. -Let me take a look at the map.
440,00:19:16.90,00:19:16.90,"-Good luck. I mean that. -See you guys on the flip side, guys."
441,00:19:19.33,00:19:19.33,"-All right. -Hey, give me a hug."
442,00:19:20.83,00:19:20.83,"-All right, buddy. -See you later, buddy, all right?"
443,00:19:22.60,00:19:22.60,"-All right, you guys. -Peace."
444,00:19:33.33,00:19:33.33,"-Yay...! -Oh, my God!"
445,00:19:35.00,00:19:35.00,JEANNE: Cinderella's back from the ball!
446,00:19:36.20,00:19:36.20,How was it?
447,00:19:37.60,00:19:37.60,"It was fun, until"
448,00:19:38.80,00:19:38.80,"a certain point, and then it didn't get fun."
449,00:19:40.97,00:19:40.97,-JEANNE: It was fun till what? -Three of you guys are going
450,00:19:43.80,00:19:43.80,"to Tambaqui,"
451,00:19:45.80,00:19:45.80,"and it's Heidi, Jeanne and Christy."
452,00:19:48.83,00:19:48.83,"HEIDI: Jenna and I  are pretty buddy-buddy,"
453,00:19:50.80,00:19:50.80, so when she came up  and told the three of us...
454,00:19:53.67,00:19:53.67,"-It was, uh, we picked... -Oh, can I get a hug?"
455,00:19:55.53,00:19:55.53,"-they picked, we... -Can we get a group hug before we do this?"
456,00:19:57.97,00:19:57.97,I really couldn't... it was a shock to me.
457,00:20:00.70,00:20:00.70," So, I mean,  it was kind of, like,"
458,00:20:02.37,00:20:02.37," ""Oh, man, that really stinks!"""
459,00:20:04.10,00:20:04.10,"-I love you. -I love you, too."
460,00:20:06.80,00:20:06.80,I'm sorry. I tried to keep us all together.
461,00:20:09.43,00:20:09.43,(sniffles)
462,00:20:10.90,00:20:10.90,I tried.
463,00:20:12.57,00:20:12.57,"-Cool. -Bye, guys."
464,00:20:14.40,00:20:14.40,"-Bye. -Bye, ladies."
465,00:20:16.47,00:20:16.47,"CHRISTY: Jeanne, I think your clothes are over here."
466,00:20:18.63,00:20:18.63,"JEANNE: Ha, ha, ha..."
467,00:20:20.13,00:20:20.13,"I'm psyched, actually."
468,00:20:21.80,00:20:21.80," Obviously, I was feeling fine."
469,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,I was happy that I was leaving that group.
470,00:20:27.00,00:20:27.00,-Bye! -JENNA: Here's your map.
471,00:20:30.00,00:20:30.00,JENNA: Love you guys.
472,00:20:36.03,00:20:36.03,HEIDI: All three of us are in the same situation right now.
473,00:20:38.50,00:20:38.50,What are they gonna think? What are we gonna do?
474,00:20:40.23,00:20:40.23,"Yeah, but if we ever had to create"
475,00:20:42.33,00:20:42.33,"an alliance, it's now."
476,00:20:43.63,00:20:43.63,"CHRISTY: Thank you, Jeanne, for paddling over there."
477,00:20:45.77,00:20:45.77,-I'm so glad. -That's okay.
478,00:20:46.97,00:20:46.97,I just wanted to tell you...
479,00:21:01.47,00:21:01.47,"-DAVE: Hey, hey, hey, hey! -HEIDI: Hey!"
480,00:21:03.70,00:21:03.70,-Welcome to Tambaqui. -Whoo-hoo!
481,00:21:06.87,00:21:06.87,-Uh-oh. -Here they are.
482,00:21:08.17,00:21:08.17,-Comb my hair. -Put my shirt on.
483,00:21:10.90,00:21:10.90,"-We're up here. Why don't, uh... -HEIDI: Okay, great."
484,00:21:12.93,00:21:12.93,...you come do the tour.
485,00:21:14.43,00:21:14.43,"-Hi, guys. -We mixed it all up. -Wow!"
486,00:21:18.97,00:21:18.97,-How are you? -Butch.
487,00:21:21.13,00:21:21.13,"-Jeanne. -Jeanne, I'm pleased to meet you."
488,00:21:22.70,00:21:22.70,"-Roger. -Roger, Jeanne."
489,00:21:23.70,00:21:23.70,"-Hi. Christy. -Christy, good to meet you."
490,00:21:25.63,00:21:25.63,"Good to meet you, Chr-Christy."
491,00:21:26.93,00:21:26.93,-Christy. -So nice to meet you.
492,00:21:28.27,00:21:28.27,"-Hi, Heidi. -Pleasure."
493,00:21:29.93,00:21:29.93,-Hi. -Sorry we stink; we were fishing.
494,00:21:32.60,00:21:32.60,JEANNE:  I was impressed.
495,00:21:34.20,00:21:34.20," Dave, Roger and Butch  all welcomed us."
496,00:21:38.20,00:21:38.20,"I mean, it was like a celebration of a new tribe."
497,00:21:40.43,00:21:40.43, -I felt awesome.  -Cool!
498,00:21:42.23,00:21:42.23,"Just to let you guys know, since we're in a circle, I am deaf,"
499,00:21:45.20,00:21:45.20,"so, um, you just got to look at me when you talk to me."
500,00:21:47.67,00:21:47.67,"When I say ""What?"" please say it again."
501,00:21:49.87,00:21:49.87,"I'm... at nighttime,"
502,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,I'm very... not helpful.
503,00:21:53.43,00:21:53.43,"If um... don't know how you guys watch fire,"
504,00:21:55.87,00:21:55.87,"if, like, one person will stay up all night and watch fire."
505,00:21:58.37,00:21:58.37,"-No, we don't watch fire. -We don't watch fire."
506,00:22:00.17,00:22:00.17,ROGER:  Very surprised to find out
507,00:22:01.47,00:22:01.47," that Christy is deaf,  and also very surprised"
508,00:22:05.23,00:22:05.23, in how well she is doing.
509,00:22:07.77,00:22:07.77,I never would have guessed that she was deaf
510,00:22:10.10,00:22:10.10,by watching the other tribe.
511,00:22:12.47,00:22:12.47," -It's... it's amazing.  -So, where you guys from?"
512,00:22:14.43,00:22:14.43,"DAVE: Well, I think without further ado, though..."
513,00:22:16.17,00:22:16.17,-Yeah! -All right!
514,00:22:17.70,00:22:17.70,JEANNE: Is this our initiation?
515,00:22:19.37,00:22:19.37,-Yup. -Cool. Thanks.
516,00:22:21.30,00:22:21.30,DAVE: If you got any speeches or whatnot.
517,00:22:23.77,00:22:23.77,"JEANNE: So, I'm psyched."
518,00:22:25.43,00:22:25.43,Raise up. You're the new guys... or the new girls.
519,00:22:28.97,00:22:28.97,ALL: Cheers!
520,00:22:30.03,00:22:30.03,-Tambaqui! -Tambaqui! -Tambaqui!
521,00:22:32.80,00:22:32.80,JEANNE: I'm psyched. I'm psyched.
522,00:22:39.97,00:22:39.97,(insects chittering)
523,00:22:42.20,00:22:42.20,"-ALEX: Honey, we're home! -ROB: Ladies, we're here!"
524,00:22:45.93,00:22:45.93,-DEENA: They're coming. -(Shawna groans)
525,00:22:49.43,00:22:49.43,"Oh, yeah! What's up?"
526,00:22:51.87,00:22:51.87,"-Whoo! -What's up, boys?"
527,00:22:54.03,00:22:54.03,-(laughs) -Yay!
528,00:22:55.70,00:22:55.70,Yeah!
529,00:22:57.47,00:22:57.47,DEENA:  It's amazing what
530,00:22:59.27,00:22:59.27, a little bit of testosterone  can do for somebody.
531,00:23:02.00,00:23:02.00,"Boys come into the camp, and Shawna is..."
532,00:23:05.13,00:23:05.13,180 degrees better.
533,00:23:07.27,00:23:07.27,-Hi. (laughing) -How are you?
534,00:23:08.83,00:23:08.83,-How are you guys? -We all stink really bad.
535,00:23:10.63,00:23:10.63,"-Hey. -Oh, it's okay. How are you?"
536,00:23:11.93,00:23:11.93,-Good. -Hey!
537,00:23:13.73,00:23:13.73,-Hi! -Hi! Great to be part of the family.
538,00:23:16.40,00:23:16.40,Look at this new buff.
539,00:23:18.17,00:23:18.17,It's a privilege to be here.
540,00:23:19.67,00:23:19.67,"ROB: You were smiling all the time, just like I was."
541,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,So I knew you were as excited as I was to be here.
542,00:23:23.33,00:23:23.33,"JENNA: See, that's what we were lacking here, some laughter."
543,00:23:25.73,00:23:25.73,"-Well, that's... -Oh, well, you got the right guys, then."
544,00:23:27.73,00:23:27.73,ROB: I'm going to wait  before I attempt any sort
545,00:23:32.33,00:23:32.33,"of proposition  to these girls, but..."
546,00:23:34.83,00:23:34.83," should Shawna and Jenna  walk around here naked,"
547,00:23:37.13,00:23:37.13, I will promise them  I will not cast a vote
548,00:23:39.67,00:23:39.67, in their direction  until the merger.
549,00:24:00.67,00:24:00.67,"CHRISTY: That really  shows that, yeah, man,"
550,00:24:02.93,00:24:02.93, I'm actually in a team
551,00:24:04.40,00:24:04.40,where... we're thinking
552,00:24:07.47,00:24:07.47,"on the same level-- like, I think"
553,00:24:09.60,00:24:09.60,-we'll kick some butt.  -The one thing
554,00:24:11.57,00:24:11.57, I like about this tribe is
555,00:24:13.63,00:24:13.63,"they're very aware that, okay, we got somebody who's deaf"
556,00:24:16.27,00:24:16.27,and they really try to make sure I'm looking.
557,00:24:19.20,00:24:19.20,ROGER: Can you... can you see?
558,00:24:20.70,00:24:20.70,CHRISTY: I see Roger. I see Butch.
559,00:24:22.90,00:24:22.90,"-ROGER: Is that okay? -I think, yeah."
560,00:24:24.17,00:24:24.17,"BUTCH:  You have to look at Christy,"
561,00:24:26.07,00:24:26.07, because she's deaf.  I'm making
562,00:24:27.20,00:24:27.20, an extra effort to make sure
563,00:24:28.70,00:24:28.70,she knows what's going on.
564,00:24:30.20,00:24:30.20,"I'm making sure that she, you know, sees me."
565,00:24:32.63,00:24:32.63, At night we can make  the lantern a little brighter.
566,00:24:35.30,00:24:35.30,"That way, she can read our lips"
567,00:24:36.93,00:24:36.93, and be included  in the evening conversation
568,00:24:39.23,00:24:39.23,and make her feel even more welcome.
569,00:24:42.57,00:24:42.57,"Guys, I mean, I'm just really glad to be in a group"
570,00:24:45.13,00:24:45.13,"where this lantern is useful, you know?"
571,00:24:48.00,00:24:48.00,"In that Jaburu tribe, it was not even..."
572,00:24:50.63,00:24:50.63,it was never possible.
573,00:24:53.07,00:24:53.07,"So I really, you know... and me feeling comfortable,"
574,00:24:55.33,00:24:55.33,I will definitely do... put my 110% into this tribe.
575,00:24:59.57,00:24:59.57," It's just a really, uh...  good feeling inside."
576,00:25:01.57,00:25:01.57," So knowing that I was  in a really good group,"
577,00:25:04.50,00:25:04.50,I really appreciate that.
578,00:25:15.83,00:25:15.83,ALEX: See if you guys can guess who got the most votes
579,00:25:19.20,00:25:19.20,for the hottest girl on...
580,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,on the old Jaburu tribe.
581,00:25:21.83,00:25:21.83,Jenna.
582,00:25:22.97,00:25:22.97,-My guess was Shawna. -ROB: You are correct.
583,00:25:24.63,00:25:24.63,-That is correct. -SHAWNA: Huh!
584,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,"-Shawna, you... -Shawna, Shawna took the..."
585,00:25:27.83,00:25:27.83,Shawna took it down.
586,00:25:29.57,00:25:29.57,SHAWNA:  Alex is so fun.
587,00:25:31.53,00:25:31.53, I dig him so much.
588,00:25:33.20,00:25:33.20, He is adorable.
589,00:25:34.67,00:25:34.67,I dig his sense of humor.
590,00:25:36.03,00:25:36.03,"He's my type, you know?"
591,00:25:37.67,00:25:37.67,"MATTHEW: Yeah, I-I really like the way the team came together."
592,00:25:39.90,00:25:39.90,"I mean, based on what we know about who we left behind."
593,00:25:42.33,00:25:42.33,ALEX: Yeah.
594,00:25:43.57,00:25:43.57,DEENA:  I'm hurtin'.
595,00:25:45.03,00:25:45.03, Deena went  from top to the bottom.
596,00:25:47.37,00:25:47.37,Shawna may not be so interested in the chick thing anymore.

797,00:34:33.63,00:34:33.63,Butch or Roger?
798,00:34:35.87,00:34:35.87,Shorter stick goes.
799,00:34:46.67,00:34:46.67,Which one's shorter?
800,00:34:49.07,00:34:49.07,-That one. Butch. -Butch.
801,00:34:51.30,00:34:51.30,CHRISTY: So Butch goes.
802,00:34:53.07,00:34:53.07,JEANNE:  It was really a toss-up.
803,00:34:54.63,00:34:54.63,We wanted to be as fair as we can be.
804,00:34:57.10,00:34:57.10,"We figured that's probably what they're gonna do, too."
805,00:35:07.00,00:35:07.00,DAVE: Today was a pisser.
806,00:35:08.50,00:35:08.50,"HEIDI: Long, long pisser."
807,00:35:10.80,00:35:10.80, Dave and I went to go  pick up some firewood.
808,00:35:13.33,00:35:13.33,"He just pulled me aside and he's, like, ""Uh, you know,"
809,00:35:15.00,00:35:15.00,"I-I definitely want to talk to you about something."""
810,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33,"DAVE: Um, I picked you,"
811,00:35:19.77,00:35:19.77,because I want to carry you over into the merge.
812,00:35:24.10,00:35:24.10,"And I talked to Butch and Roger, and you're..."
813,00:35:28.00,00:35:28.00,"I mean, it's gonna be the four of us."
814,00:35:29.70,00:35:29.70," And so he just told me, you  know, ""I really want you to"
815,00:35:32.27,00:35:32.27,"try to be an alliance with the other three guys here,"" so..."
816,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17, It's just the conversation  just all of a sudden
817,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50," came up, so that  kind of caught me"
818,00:35:37.93,00:35:37.93," -off guard, actually.  -Like, if you were"
819,00:35:39.30,00:35:39.30,"in my position, what do you think you would do?"
820,00:35:41.33,00:35:41.33,-I'd c... I'd come with us. -You would?
821,00:35:44.40,00:35:44.40,We're going with plan A.
822,00:35:46.00,00:35:46.00,Jeanne's gone tonight.
823,00:35:47.57,00:35:47.57,"-Oh, man.  -Heidi needs to know"
824,00:35:49.47,00:35:49.47,that we plan on getting rid of Jeanne first and then Christy.
825,00:35:53.67,00:35:53.67, Jeanne was kind of next  on the chopping block
826,00:35:56.23,00:35:56.23, for Jaburu.
827,00:35:57.70,00:35:57.70,"So I understand with my vote, I mean, definitely you guys"
828,00:36:00.33,00:36:00.33,are getting ahead.
829,00:36:01.77,00:36:01.77,"But if we lose the next two, you know I'm out of here."
830,00:36:05.07,00:36:05.07,-You know what I'm trying to say? -I-I...
831,00:36:06.67,00:36:06.67,"-I won't bull ... you, you know? That's what it is. -I know."
832,00:36:08.63,00:36:08.63,I know it is.
833,00:36:10.47,00:36:10.47,HEIDI: I had a strong alliance  with the girls before I came
834,00:36:13.47,00:36:13.47, into this tribe.
835,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83," It's kind of like, okay, now  what do I do? I mean..."
836,00:36:18.67,00:36:18.67,I am really in just a rock and a hard stone.
837,00:36:21.27,00:36:21.27,"I mean, I am just right there."
838,00:36:22.73,00:36:22.73,"I am, like, the key factor right now"
839,00:36:24.60,00:36:24.60,to this whole voting process tonight.
840,00:36:26.93,00:36:26.93,And I'm incredibly uncomfortable with that.
841,00:37:01.93,00:37:01.93,Welcome to your first Tribal Council as the new Tambaqui.
842,00:37:05.37,00:37:05.37,First thing I want to know is reaction
843,00:37:07.37,00:37:07.37,to the switch of tribes. Jeanne?
844,00:37:09.37,00:37:09.37,"I was excited for a change,"
845,00:37:11.37,00:37:11.37,"I really was, and the gentlemen here,"
846,00:37:13.37,00:37:13.37,"they were gentlemen, they welcomed us."
847,00:37:15.87,00:37:15.87,"-It really was great. -Heidi,"
848,00:37:17.90,00:37:17.90,"what does that do to your feelings of the old Jaburu,"
849,00:37:20.90,00:37:20.90,the women that are still on Jaburu?
850,00:37:22.67,00:37:22.67,"HEIDI: I adore Jenna,"
851,00:37:23.90,00:37:23.90,"so, I mean, I have no hard feelings whatsoever."
852,00:37:26.90,00:37:26.90,She made the choice based on what she had to go with.
853,00:37:29.07,00:37:29.07,I still love 'em all.
854,00:37:30.90,00:37:30.90,"I'm glad to be here just as much, though."
855,00:37:33.07,00:37:33.07,"PROBST: Christy, how has"
856,00:37:34.43,00:37:34.43,your assimilation with this new tribe been?
857,00:37:37.43,00:37:37.43,These guys handled it so much better
858,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83,than the girls did when I joined their tribe.
859,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93,"They were awesome, and I just really appreciate it."
860,00:37:46.93,00:37:46.93,"You know, they really would try their best to look at me,"
861,00:37:50.03,00:37:50.03,and try their best to really include me
862,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,and not feel like I do have a disability.
863,00:37:54.47,00:37:54.47,"Which is just... oh, I'm so impressed."
864,00:37:57.97,00:37:57.97,PROBST: So what do you do now?
865,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,Somebody's going tonight.
866,00:38:01.57,00:38:01.57,"What's that gonna be based on, Christy?"
867,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,Alliances.
868,00:38:05.07,00:38:05.07,PROBST: So do you...
869,00:38:06.93,00:38:06.93,"look at old alliances and give them a value,"
870,00:38:09.50,00:38:09.50,"or do you say, you know,"
871,00:38:11.07,00:38:11.07,"""I can't, I'm in a new tribe""?"
872,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,"Well, it's hard, we've only..."
873,00:38:14.87,00:38:14.87,I met these guys a day and a half.
874,00:38:17.47,00:38:17.47,We didn't really have time to really mingle.
875,00:38:19.93,00:38:19.93,"I don't know, it is a very hard decision,"
876,00:38:22.47,00:38:22.47,"and yes, it's on numbers, and I'd have to say alliance."
877,00:38:25.60,00:38:25.60,"You know, alliance is what I can depend on."
878,00:38:29.03,00:38:29.03,"PROBST: Well, alliances give both tribes"
879,00:38:31.10,00:38:31.10,a 50-50 chance of being the dominant faction tomorrow.
880,00:38:35.63,00:38:35.63,"-Right. -Right now you're even, three-three."
881,00:38:38.13,00:38:38.13,"Three women, three men."
882,00:38:39.87,00:38:39.87,"So, Roger,"
883,00:38:41.03,00:38:41.03,-how you vote? -It's a new day.
884,00:38:43.43,00:38:43.43,"I'm gonna vote, uh, who I think is the weakest, uh..."
885,00:38:47.13,00:38:47.13,weakest link to go on.
886,00:38:48.37,00:38:48.37,PROBST: So old alliances with
887,00:38:50.47,00:38:50.47,the men could be out the window-- if Butch is
888,00:38:52.17,00:38:52.17,"the weak guy, that's the way it goes."
889,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,Exactly.
890,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43,"Jeanne, how you voting?"
891,00:38:56.67,00:38:56.67,Weakest link.
892,00:38:58.47,00:38:58.47,And alliance.
893,00:39:01.23,00:39:01.23,And they both are the same?
894,00:39:02.67,00:39:02.67,Mm-hmm.
895,00:39:03.73,00:39:03.73,"Heidi, how are you voting?"
896,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,I'd say...
897,00:39:07.17,00:39:07.17,"I mean, yeah."
898,00:39:09.07,00:39:09.07,There are so many things running through my head right now.
899,00:39:11.27,00:39:11.27,"-Give me one. -You know, I mean, it is"
900,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,"girls against guys, and then at the same time we're a team."
901,00:39:17.07,00:39:17.07,That's just killing me right now.
902,00:39:18.33,00:39:18.33,"Just, like, you know, head spinning. (laughs)"
903,00:39:21.40,00:39:21.40,"And, uh, it's killing me."
904,00:39:24.20,00:39:24.20,It is time to vote.
905,00:39:26.00,00:39:26.00,Butch.
906,00:40:48.23,00:40:48.23,I'll go tally the votes.
907,00:40:59.90,00:40:59.90,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
908,00:41:02.83,00:41:02.83,Person voted out'll be asked to leave
909,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33,the Tribal Council area immediately.
910,00:41:05.90,00:41:05.90,I'll read the votes.
911,00:41:09.03,00:41:09.03,First vote...
912,00:41:11.83,00:41:11.83,...Jeanne.
913,00:41:16.73,00:41:16.73,"Butch. One vote-- Butch, one vote-- Jeanne."
914,00:41:26.43,00:41:26.43,Jeanne. That's two.
915,00:41:32.77,00:41:32.77,"That's two votes-- Butch, two votes-- Jeanne."
916,00:41:41.30,00:41:41.30,"Jeanne. That's three votes-- Jeanne, two votes-- Butch."
917,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,Last vote.
918,00:41:50.97,00:41:50.97,Fifth person voted out of the Amazon...
919,00:41:53.33,00:41:53.33,Jeanne.
920,00:41:55.13,00:41:55.13,You need to bring me your torch.
921,00:42:10.00,00:42:10.00,"Jeanne, the tribe has spoken."
922,00:42:21.80,00:42:21.80,"So I guess the question is,"
923,00:42:25.13,00:42:25.13,"was tonight's vote based on old tribal gender lines, or,"
924,00:42:30.37,00:42:30.37,"as you guys say, the weak link in a new, big, happy tribe?"
925,00:42:34.63,00:42:34.63,Guess we'll find out.
926,00:42:35.90,00:42:35.90,You can head back to camp. Good night.
927,00:42:50.53,00:42:50.53,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
928,00:42:56.43,00:42:56.43,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
929,00:42:59.13,00:42:59.13, Tambaqui shares  a tender moment.
930,00:43:02.20,00:43:02.20," BUTCH: That smile on Christy's  face, that's a moment, I'll"
931,00:43:04.20,00:43:04.20,never forget that as long as I live.
932,00:43:05.53,00:43:05.53,"PROBST: And at Jaburu,  Shawna's recovery"
933,00:43:07.90,00:43:07.90, is sparked by Alex.
934,00:43:09.10,00:43:09.10,SHAWNA:  I definitely want
935,00:43:10.17,00:43:10.17,to get to know him better.
936,00:43:11.40,00:43:11.40," Like, he's  an incredible person."
937,00:43:13.13,00:43:13.13,"At Jaburu, is there romance"
938,00:43:14.40,00:43:14.40, in the air? Maybe.
939,00:43:21.60,00:43:21.60,"I guess I wasn't made to play this game, because..."
940,00:43:25.27,00:43:25.27," I didn't want to lie or cheat,"
941,00:43:27.40,00:43:27.40, and I know that's  how I'm off right now.
942,00:43:29.47,00:43:29.47, I played a tough game-- I'm
943,00:43:31.07,00:43:31.07," tough, I'm mean, I'm focused"
944,00:43:32.63,00:43:32.63," I'm determined, but I guess"
945,00:43:34.07,00:43:34.07, I'm just not a nasty liar.
946,00:43:35.43,00:43:35.43, And that's really  what you have to be.
947,00:43:37.43,00:43:37.43,"Good luck to them, because in the game of life,"
948,00:43:39.73,00:43:39.73,I'm the winner.
