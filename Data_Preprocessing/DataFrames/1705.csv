3,00:00:05.04,00:00:05.04,tribes have been battling. Nobody on the Fang goal!
4,00:00:08.08,00:00:08.08,"How does that happen? Kota, the yellow tribe, has won"
5,00:00:11.08,00:00:11.08,six out of eight challenges and lives very well.
6,00:00:14.12,00:00:14.12,>> Life is good. >> The rich are definitely
7,00:00:16.50,00:00:16.50,"getting richer here at Kota. >> PROBST: Fang, the red tribe,"
8,00:00:19.17,00:00:19.17,"has struggled with everything, and squandered most of their"
9,00:00:21.62,00:00:21.62,food. >> It's the Goof Troop.
10,00:00:23.29,00:00:23.29,"It's ridiculous. >> PROBST: At Fang, Ace and"
11,00:00:25.42,00:00:25.42,Sugar were tight with each other and no one else.
12,00:00:28.21,00:00:28.21,And Sugar had the hidden immunity idol.
13,00:00:34.42,00:00:34.42,>> I trust you. >> PROBST: So when the rest of
14,00:00:36.04,00:00:36.04,"Fang discovered the idol, they agreed that Sugar and Ace were"
15,00:00:39.38,00:00:39.38,"the next to go. >> See ya, beeyotch."
16,00:00:42.75,00:00:42.75,>> PROBST: The two outsiders got a temporary reprieve when GC
17,00:00:46.83,00:00:46.83,got tired of the game and said he couldn't go on.
18,00:00:49.04,00:00:49.04,>> He came up to me and said that he's just done with this.
19,00:00:52.00,00:00:52.00,He's had enough. >> PROBST: The tribe saw his
20,00:00:54.04,00:00:54.04,"weakness and voted him out. GC, the tribe has spoken."
21,00:00:58.25,00:00:58.25,Can Fang turn it around? And can Ace and Sugar survive
22,00:01:01.38,00:01:01.38,another Tribal Council? 13 are left.
23,00:01:04.67,00:01:04.67,Who will be voted out tonight? (metal striking repeatedly)
24,00:01:23.75,00:01:23.75,">> Nice! >> Yay, Matty!"
25,00:01:26.04,00:01:26.04,">> Ah, I'm so happy. >> Oh, yeah."
26,00:01:28.88,00:01:28.88,">> It's just, like, positive energy now; we're all positive."
27,00:01:32.08,00:01:32.08,"Nobody is dragging. >> You know, tonight was"
28,00:01:34.33,00:01:34.33,"particularly hard. >> Yeah, tonight was hard."
29,00:01:38.38,00:01:38.38,">> Tribal Council is sad. You know, not unexpected."
30,00:01:43.00,00:01:43.00,"Um... GC had to go. I've got Sugar in my pocket, and"
31,00:01:47.21,00:01:47.21,I need to try and arrange something that I can save myself
32,00:01:51.54,00:01:51.54,until merge. I just don't know who would be
33,00:01:54.21,00:01:54.21,my potential Benedict Arnold. >> (sings indistinctly)
34,00:02:04.08,00:02:04.08,>> Good morning. >> How'd you sleep?
35,00:02:07.83,00:02:07.83,">> Not very good. I was, like, up all night."
36,00:02:11.12,00:02:11.12,">> That's crazy, dude. >> I know what means the most to"
37,00:02:14.62,00:02:14.62,"me in my life. Every night I dream about food,"
38,00:02:18.71,00:02:18.71,"my dog, and my girlfriend. Every night."
39,00:02:21.29,00:02:21.29,This is by far the hardest thing I've ever done.
40,00:02:25.04,00:02:25.04,But... my whole driving force out here is Jamie-- she's my
41,00:02:27.96,00:02:27.96,girlfriend-- so I'm trying to make some sort of ring-type
42,00:02:30.25,00:02:30.25,thing. It's just something to keep
43,00:02:33.38,00:02:33.38,"myself reminded of her. Because of her, I want to finish"
44,00:02:37.50,00:02:37.50,"this out to the end. I'm in a terrible position, and"
45,00:02:39.79,00:02:39.79,I feel like I've been in a bad position the moment this game
46,00:02:42.92,00:02:42.92,started with Fang. If somebody approached me with
47,00:02:45.33,00:02:45.33,"a legitimate, logical, reasonable plan that might"
48,00:02:48.79,00:02:48.79,"work, for sure I'm on board, man."
49,00:02:51.21,00:02:51.21,I am jumping on board and I'm flying with it.
50,00:02:55.75,00:02:55.75,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Come over here.
51,00:03:03.12,00:03:03.12,"What do you think? >> I'm just stressed, man."
52,00:03:05.46,00:03:05.46,">> Why? >> Man, I just want to make it"
53,00:03:07.54,00:03:07.54,"as far as possible, you know? >> You know, I just... I prefer"
54,00:03:15.54,00:03:15.54,not to be blindsided. >> It all just depends on how
55,00:03:21.08,00:03:21.08,"close everyone is, you know? I mean, you want to keep Kenny"
56,00:03:24.62,00:03:24.62,"around? Or Crystal, and all them?"
57,00:03:30.21,00:03:30.21,">> Kenny. >> I mean, I-I don't really want"
58,00:03:38.17,00:03:38.17,"Sugar to go. You've got your Kenny, I've..."
59,00:03:40.08,00:03:40.08,">> That's fine. Okay, that's cool."
60,00:03:42.04,00:03:42.04,That's the deal. >> Deal?
61,00:03:43.25,00:03:43.25,">> Deal. I got my Kenny, and you got your Sugar."
62,00:03:45.17,00:03:45.17,">> Until merge, you're... on your girl, you're not"
63,00:03:47.08,00:03:47.08,gonna stab me in the back. >> Okay.
64,00:03:50.17,00:03:50.17,>> I'll... I can guarantee I'm with you.
65,00:03:51.46,00:03:51.46,">> Okay, what do you have to put it on, then?"
66,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,>> My mother's life. >> Your mother's life that
67,00:03:57.08,00:03:57.08,"you're gonna get me to... >> Yeah, same as your girl's."
68,00:03:59.04,00:03:59.04,">> Okay, I'll put it on my girl, then."
69,00:04:00.92,00:04:00.92,>> Okay? >> All right.
70,00:04:02.71,00:04:02.71,">> I mean, that's huge. My mother's my best friend."
71,00:04:05.12,00:04:05.12,>> My girl's my everything. I think Ace and I are probably
72,00:04:09.29,00:04:09.29,"some of the top competitors out here physically, and I do like"
73,00:04:12.67,00:04:12.67,"him on my side, and... I made a pact with Ace that I can't"
74,00:04:17.67,00:04:17.67,"break, and I promised on my girlfriend, which is the love of"
75,00:04:20.54,00:04:20.54,"my life. She's my driving force out here,"
76,00:04:22.21,00:04:22.21,and I'm not gonna break that promise for a million dollars.
77,00:04:25.12,00:04:25.12,Not for $5 million. (theme song playing)

84,00:05:44.88,00:05:44.88,>> Randy. Are you gonna eat off this one?
85,00:05:47.00,00:05:47.00,>> Yeah. >> We might have to share
86,00:05:48.79,00:05:48.79,"together, Bob. >> Yep. It works."
87,00:05:51.96,00:05:51.96,"We've been eating very well, and when we got spices and salt, we"
88,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,started eating quite a bit. But Dan was shoveling it on with
89,00:05:59.29,00:05:59.29,"a spoon, and I realized when I served Susie and I, I put the"
90,00:06:03.58,00:06:03.58,same number of scoops on my plate for Susie and I to share
91,00:06:07.79,00:06:07.79,as Dan put on for himself. >> It doesn't matter if you
92,00:06:15.17,00:06:15.17,"weigh a hundred pounds more than me, you've still got the same,"
93,00:06:18.12,00:06:18.12,"like, proportion of food. But Dan's decided that he"
94,00:06:21.50,00:06:21.50,deserves fourth and fifth servings of food.
95,00:06:25.12,00:06:25.12,(indistinct chatter) So now we are going through food
96,00:06:30.50,00:06:30.50,"at an alarming rate, and he takes... multiple servings."
97,00:06:35.50,00:06:35.50,I'm sick about how much food is being wasted on him.
98,00:06:39.17,00:06:39.17,(frustrated grunt) \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
99,00:06:49.83,00:06:49.83,">> Well, what do you guys think? You think there's enough rice to"
100,00:06:52.46,00:06:52.46,get through nine days? >> Here's the thing.
101,00:06:55.21,00:06:55.21,We could do two small. Say you want... or one big one
102,00:06:59.71,00:06:59.71,"later? >> So whatever you guys think,"
103,00:07:01.62,00:07:01.62,man. That's better for digestion:
104,00:07:04.46,00:07:04.46,"we get two small meals. >> Cooking small, it's not that"
105,00:07:08.83,00:07:08.83,good 'cause a lot of it sticks to the side.
106,00:07:11.25,00:07:11.25,">> I agree. >> Starting on day one, I was"
107,00:07:14.62,00:07:14.62,talking about how everybody does not reserve the right to just
108,00:07:17.04,00:07:17.04,"eating it raw and... and just spilling it all over the place,"
109,00:07:19.62,00:07:19.62,"and now, of course, we have a shortage of rice."
110,00:07:23.17,00:07:23.17,"We have about six days' worth. If we don't have rice, we're"
111,00:07:26.04,00:07:26.04,"dead. Basically, we're gone."
112,00:07:28.12,00:07:28.12,It's hard for our tribe right now.
113,00:07:30.25,00:07:30.25,"It's, like, we're at rock bottom."
114,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00,>> Hello there. >> Hello.
115,00:07:47.04,00:07:47.04,>> Why? >> Yeah. Um...
116,00:08:15.17,00:08:15.17,Right? I was trying to hang on to my
117,00:08:19.79,00:08:19.79,"idol as long as possible, but Ace came and told me that he"
118,00:08:23.79,00:08:23.79,thinks they've gone through my bag and found it.
119,00:08:29.08,00:08:29.08,So I gave it to Ace for safekeeping.
120,00:08:34.96,00:08:34.96,Ace is now in possession of the idol.
121,00:08:37.17,00:08:37.17,He's got it in his pocket. I'm really putting a lot of
122,00:08:39.83,00:08:39.83,"faith in Ace right now. Ace is kind of a snake, but he's"
123,00:08:42.92,00:08:42.92,"my snake, and I'm glad to have him."
124,00:08:45.71,00:08:45.71,>> It's been a crazy couple of days.
125,00:08:47.83,00:08:47.83,It went from me being in a position of no power to a
126,00:08:51.17,00:08:51.17,"position of supremacy, having the immunity idol in my pocket."
127,00:08:55.92,00:08:55.92,I have Matty's word. I have Sugar.
128,00:08:58.21,00:08:58.21,"I feel like I've put myself in a very good position, coming from"
129,00:09:01.42,00:09:01.42,a tribe that I didn't have any alliance with.
130,00:09:04.38,00:09:04.38,"And now suddenly, you know, I've got people there."
131,00:09:08.04,00:09:08.04,"(elephant trumpets) Oh, my God, this is amazing."
132,00:09:13.33,00:09:13.33,I just turned around and there's an elephant swimming
133,00:09:15.42,00:09:15.42,"through the water. Oh, how beautiful."
134,00:09:19.12,00:09:19.12,I guess that's one way to get from one side to the other.

189,00:12:28.04,00:12:28.04,Here we go. >> Come on!
190,00:12:30.92,00:12:30.92,>> We've got to speed up. >> We got to move!
191,00:12:32.75,00:12:32.75,>> PROBST: Kota continues to make up ground.
192,00:12:35.62,00:12:35.62,>> We're gaining on them. >> PROBST: Fang is fading very
193,00:12:38.12,00:12:38.12,quickly. >> Drop half the people and we
194,00:12:40.17,00:12:40.17,sprint. Go. Just get off.
195,00:12:43.12,00:12:43.12,">> Okay. >> Sugar, go. Kenny, go."
196,00:12:45.75,00:12:45.75,>> Run! >> PROBST: Sugar and Kenny both
197,00:12:47.46,00:12:47.46,"drop out, and that seems to help Fang."
198,00:12:49.75,00:12:49.75,">> Come on, guys. >> PROBST: They're now moving"
199,00:12:51.67,00:12:51.67,much more quickly. >> Put 'em down right now.  
200,00:12:54.21,00:12:54.21,">> Go, Kelly. Get out of here. Just unhook."
201,00:12:57.83,00:12:57.83,>> PROBST: Kelly has now dropped out.
202,00:13:00.17,00:13:00.17,>> Let's do this! >> PROBST: Fang is down to
203,00:13:01.71,00:13:01.71,"three members. >> Come on, guys."
204,00:13:05.96,00:13:05.96,>> PROBST: Susie drops out for Kota.
205,00:13:08.62,00:13:08.62,Fang now getting some distance on Kota now that they've lost
206,00:13:12.25,00:13:12.25,Kenny and Sugar and Kelly. >> I'm getting tired.
207,00:13:19.54,00:13:19.54,>> PROBST: Crystal is starting to drag now.
208,00:13:21.42,00:13:21.42,>> They're dragging. Come on!
209,00:13:25.04,00:13:25.04,>> PROBST: Matty pushing her. Frustrated.
210,00:13:29.58,00:13:29.58,">> Crystal, just drop out if you can't do it!"
211,00:13:31.38,00:13:31.38,>> PROBST: Crystal now drops out.
212,00:13:33.08,00:13:33.08,">> I can't take all that  weight, Matty."
213,00:13:34.38,00:13:34.38,>> Come on. Let's go! >> PROBST: It's all on Matty
214,00:13:36.67,00:13:36.67,and Ace. Big opening for Kota now.
215,00:13:39.54,00:13:39.54,">> Yeah, you've got this! >> PROBST: Kota with five"
216,00:13:41.58,00:13:41.58,"strong guys going up against Matty and Ace, who are"
217,00:13:46.25,00:13:46.25,struggling. >> Come on the side of me!
218,00:13:48.08,00:13:48.08,"Come on the side of me, man! (grunting)"
219,00:13:51.00,00:13:51.00,"Come on, grab it! >> PROBST: Matty carrying half"
220,00:13:53.00,00:13:53.00,that snake himself. Ace dragging the other half.
221,00:13:55.83,00:13:55.83,Ace trying to keep his pants up! Kota closing in on a big win
222,00:13:59.42,00:13:59.42,and a huge reward. >> Yeah!
223,00:14:02.00,00:14:02.00,Yeah! Yeah!
224,00:14:04.54,00:14:04.54,>> PROBST: Kota wins reward. >> Yeah!
225,00:14:10.00,00:14:10.00,>> Not even close. Not even close.
226,00:14:12.25,00:14:12.25,"Nice. >> You all right, Bob?"
227,00:14:13.46,00:14:13.46,">> Oh, God. >> If I can do it at your age..."
228,00:14:20.17,00:14:20.17,">> PROBST: Kota, congratulations."
229,00:14:22.79,00:14:22.79,This reward has enough for you to sample a little now and
230,00:14:27.21,00:14:27.21,still have plenty to take back to camp.
231,00:14:29.50,00:14:29.50,>> Can you share? >> Can we have one?
232,00:14:31.58,00:14:31.58,">> Uh, no. >> Everyone grab one of these."
233,00:14:34.75,00:14:34.75,">> Thank you, Jeff. >> Ooh, I want some"
234,00:14:37.25,00:14:37.25,strawberries. >> Mmm!
235,00:14:41.75,00:14:41.75,">> Crystal, what hurts more, losing or seeing this tempting"
236,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,array of food in front of you and knowing you can't have it?
237,00:14:50.17,00:14:50.17,>> Losing over and over. (sniffles)
238,00:14:52.92,00:14:52.92,It's starting to hurt. >> PROBST: Something you're not
239,00:14:54.38,00:14:54.38,used to. >> No.
240,00:14:56.58,00:14:56.58,">> Waah, waah, waah! >> PROBST: All right, Kota, who"
241,00:15:00.88,00:15:00.88,are you going to send from Fang to Exile Island?
242,00:15:03.17,00:15:03.17,">> Sugar. >> PROBST: Sugar, for the"
243,00:15:05.08,00:15:05.08,"fourth time, you'll be sent to Exile Island."
244,00:15:09.04,00:15:09.04,"Sugar, you will return in time for the next immunity challenge."
245,00:15:15.17,00:15:15.17,"Fang, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff."
246,00:15:17.54,00:15:17.54,Head back to camp. >> I love winning challenges.
247,00:15:23.38,00:15:23.38,"More importantly than winning challenges, I absolutely love"
248,00:15:27.54,00:15:27.54,"watching them lose. >> PROBST: Kota,"
249,00:15:30.21,00:15:30.21,congratulations. Come get your reward.
250,00:15:34.21,00:15:34.21,">> Randy? To me, he's just... He's a troll."
251,00:15:37.17,00:15:37.17,He's a troll under the bridge that's just mean and angry with
252,00:15:39.79,00:15:39.79,the world. I don't play like that.
253,00:15:42.25,00:15:42.25,Do not disrespect me like that. I have a feeling that in the
254,00:15:46.08,00:15:46.08,"event there's a merge, that old Fang and new Fang won't"
255,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,"get along.  >> No pun intended, but sweet."
256,00:16:07.17,00:16:07.17,">> Today's challenge just showed that Kota is a strong, unified"
257,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,team. And I'm so excited to see that.
258,00:16:12.17,00:16:12.17,"I mean, when it works like a charm in the challenges, there's"
259,00:16:16.83,00:16:16.83,just no better feeling. >> I think we need a table to
260,00:16:19.08,00:16:19.08,sit down and have breakfast at. >> Has anyone thought about how
261,00:16:21.58,00:16:21.58,we want to split this up? >> Charlie had a great idea.
262,00:16:23.71,00:16:23.71,"Split it up, and each individual person can just eat"
263,00:16:27.12,00:16:27.12,"their share as they want. >> Well, I know that, um, there"
264,00:16:30.54,00:16:30.54,are definitely seven croissants and there's seven
265,00:16:32.38,00:16:32.38,of these jelly things. >> Okay.
266,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,>> And then we could figure out how many's in the middle.
267,00:16:37.08,00:16:37.08,">> So, if someone doesn't want an eclair, they can get an"
268,00:16:38.71,00:16:38.71,extra one of these. If someone doesn't want
269,00:16:40.54,00:16:40.54,"a Cinnabon, they can get one of those."
270,00:16:41.83,00:16:41.83,">> If it wasn't for Dan, we wouldn't have rationing laws,"
271,00:16:43.46,00:16:43.46,"so when the pastries came back, like, the old Kota"
272,00:16:46.04,00:16:46.04,"members like me, Marcus, and Charlie are already like, ""How"
273,00:16:49.46,00:16:49.46,"are we going to divide this?"" So we tried to make it as fair"
274,00:16:51.50,00:16:51.50,as possible. >> This will be...
275,00:16:53.25,00:16:53.25,>> This should just be gravy. >> What do you mean gravy?
276,00:16:57.25,00:16:57.25,">> Extra. Go with the original plan, which"
277,00:16:59.29,00:16:59.29,"was cook dinner and, um, you know, this is just..."
278,00:17:07.21,00:17:07.21,">> Yeah, 'cause that will give us one more meal on the back"
279,00:17:09.04,00:17:09.04,end. >> Exactly.
280,00:17:10.00,00:17:10.00,>> That's why it's a good idea. >> I don't want to be hungry
281,00:17:12.04,00:17:12.04,"come midnight. >> Dan, he has annoyed"
282,00:17:15.38,00:17:15.38,everybody. He's even annoyed me a little
283,00:17:18.08,00:17:18.08,bit. >> This is so good.
284,00:17:19.83,00:17:19.83,"I can't stop. >> Yeah, it does."
285,00:17:22.25,00:17:22.25,It feels so good when it hits my lips.
286,00:17:24.29,00:17:24.29,>> My best move might be to just kind of slowly distance
287,00:17:27.46,00:17:27.46,myself from Dan as I bring myself closer to the original
288,00:17:31.58,00:17:31.58,"Kota. >> God, those pastries are good."
289,00:17:34.96,00:17:34.96,">> Go for it. >> If I take one bite, I only"
290,00:17:36.21,00:17:36.21,have one and a half left. >> It's a reward.
291,00:17:38.75,00:17:38.75,There's no rationing. >> Don't do that.
292,00:17:49.08,00:17:49.08,>> I knew that they were probably going to send me back
293,00:17:51.96,00:17:51.96,to Exile. This is lame.
294,00:17:54.00,00:17:54.00,Why-why... Why do I get to come back here
295,00:18:01.46,00:18:01.46,and... Eat fruit when everybody is
296,00:18:04.42,00:18:04.42,"starving at my tribe, and they're running out of food,"
297,00:18:07.12,00:18:07.12,and they don't have anything but rice.
298,00:18:08.96,00:18:08.96,And I'm feeling really guilty. I just feel bad knowing that I
299,00:18:17.54,00:18:17.54,"already have the idol. Actually, I gave Ace the idol in"
300,00:18:21.21,00:18:21.21,"case he needs it before Tribal, but..."
301,00:18:25.33,00:18:25.33,"Well, we'll see if that happens. >> I wouldn't mind getting some"
302,00:18:33.79,00:18:33.79,"more of the fruit. >> Hey, this is my opinion."
303,00:18:35.79,00:18:35.79,Today it's super mellow out. >> Re-hydrate.
304,00:18:38.62,00:18:38.62,">> Tomorrow we're going to have a big day, and it's probably"
305,00:18:40.25,00:18:40.25,going to be super hot. So we might as well get
306,00:18:42.46,00:18:42.46,"everything done today, get all the canteens filled."
307,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,>> I don't know why you're stressing over it.
308,00:18:47.88,00:18:47.88,">> I'm not stressing. >> Yes, you are."
309,00:18:51.25,00:18:51.25,>> Fang lost another challenge. We needed that food because
310,00:18:54.92,00:18:54.92,"I'm, like, withering away, and we have, like, three scoops"
311,00:18:58.08,00:18:58.08,"of rice. And then, Crystal's reaction"
312,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,"of our loss was huge. She just, like, broke down in"
313,00:19:03.25,00:19:03.25,"tears. Personally, I just think her"
314,00:19:04.88,00:19:04.88,personality sucks. >> I know.
315,00:19:10.50,00:19:10.50,"Like, seriously, that all just, like, sucks."
316,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,"It's like a damper on the team. Like, you don't need to cry,"
317,00:19:16.58,00:19:16.58,"right? >> Well, it's just a different"
318,00:19:18.62,00:19:18.62,sort of cry than uh... Sugar's cry is more a...
319,00:19:21.33,00:19:21.33,">> Emotional. >> Emotional, I'm happy to be"
320,00:19:22.88,00:19:22.88,here. >> Right.
321,00:19:31.25,00:19:31.25,>> Don't view my tears at today's challenge as a sign of
322,00:19:34.96,00:19:34.96,weakness. Because it's far from that.
323,00:19:40.04,00:19:40.04,You and Kelly view me as weak now because I was crying?
324,00:19:42.58,00:19:42.58,">> Not weak. >> Where did they go, up by the"
325,00:19:45.38,00:19:45.38,hill or they went by tree mail? >> By tree mail and by the hill.
326,00:19:49.67,00:19:49.67,">> I hope that they don't put me in the same category as GC,"
327,00:19:53.04,00:19:53.04,someone that wants to give up. Because shortly after I got
328,00:19:56.54,00:19:56.54,"back to camp, I snapped out of my funk."
329,00:19:58.50,00:19:58.50,"But Kelly hasn't had two words to say to me, and so now she's"
330,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,going to feel the wrath of Crystal.
331,00:20:04.04,00:20:04.04,">> Hey, how did you get here? >> Same way you got here."
332,00:20:07.12,00:20:07.12,>> Really? >> She walked.
333,00:20:08.54,00:20:08.54,">> Are you feeling better? >> Yeah, I mean, y'all have"
334,00:20:11.71,00:20:11.71,already had the comforts of food.
335,00:20:13.54,00:20:13.54,"I mean, you guys have had fish. I've had a pinch of a freaking"
336,00:20:19.08,00:20:19.08,sardine. You know what I'm saying?
337,00:20:21.08,00:20:21.08,">> Mm-hmm. >> But, like I tell you and like"
338,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,I tell everybody else in my tribe: don't mistake my tears
339,00:20:25.67,00:20:25.67,"as a sign of weakness because at some point, we all get"
340,00:20:28.79,00:20:28.79,depressed. It's just that mine come out
341,00:20:30.67,00:20:30.67,"through my eyes, you know. I mean, I think I can still"
342,00:20:33.92,00:20:33.92,battle with the best of them and just don't mistake it as a
343,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83,sign of weakness because it's not.
344,00:20:38.21,00:20:38.21,But I'm fine now. >> I definitely think that
345,00:20:40.79,00:20:40.79,"Crystal crying in front of the Kota tribe and our tribe, it"
346,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,"shows a sign of weakness. Like, you could take it"
347,00:20:45.46,00:20:45.46,"either which way, you know. Like, she can explain it to us,"
348,00:20:47.79,00:20:47.79,but she can't explain it to the Kota tribe.
349,00:20:50.08,00:20:50.08,">> I think more so with me, it wasn't the danish, it was the"
350,00:20:52.42,00:20:52.42,"pride. >> It just sucks,"
351,00:20:54.67,00:20:54.67,"especially when you lose, and we lose every time."
352,00:21:11.46,00:21:11.46,>> Marcus. A giant turtle.
353,00:21:13.67,00:21:13.67,">> A giant turtle? >> Not giant, but big enough."
354,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,">> Okay, hold on, hold on. Hold on."
355,00:21:20.25,00:21:20.25,Let me give you my shirt or something.
356,00:21:22.12,00:21:22.12,Untie me. I'll bring the boat around.
357,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,>> Your hands are too important. Hold on.
358,00:21:27.92,00:21:27.92,>> Listen to me. I don't want you to lose your
359,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,hand. >> It doesn't matter.
360,00:21:31.21,00:21:31.21,It's food. >> Whoo!
361,00:21:33.54,00:21:33.54,">> All right, we've got a turtle!"
362,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,I was really excited because it was like winning a reward
363,00:21:38.12,00:21:38.12,"challenge, except we did it ourselves, so it had that extra"
364,00:21:41.92,00:21:41.92,bit of joy to it. >> That is neat.
365,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,">> You know... You know how to cook that,"
366,00:21:44.88,00:21:44.88,right? >> That's good size.
367,00:21:46.12,00:21:46.12,">> Kill it and then crack the shell, break it out, and cut it"
368,00:21:49.38,00:21:49.38,in cubes and boil it. >> Wow.
369,00:21:50.79,00:21:50.79,>> Go for it. I'm excited about it.
370,00:21:52.33,00:21:52.33,I think it's going to taste good.
371,00:21:53.71,00:21:53.71,Have you ever had gumbo turtle soup here in the jungles of
372,00:21:58.25,00:21:58.25,Africa? How cool is that?
373,00:21:59.79,00:21:59.79,>> It's going to be delish. I know it.

375,00:22:04.42,00:22:04.42,Mmm. >> I can't complain.
376,00:22:08.62,00:22:08.62,">> Right now, the Kota tribe is probably at our highest high."
377,00:22:11.83,00:22:11.83,The fact that we caught a turtle has just knocked us up
378,00:22:14.58,00:22:14.58,ten notches. Fang better watch out.
379,00:22:17.00,00:22:17.00,">> (muffled): I love it. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."

388,00:23:07.25,00:23:07.25,Each pair will be tethered together by rope.
389,00:23:10.17,00:23:10.17,"On my go, the first pair will crawl under a cargo net, race"

392,00:23:20.38,00:23:20.38,Then the next pair goes. Each leg of the challenge adds
393,00:23:23.96,00:23:23.96,"another obstacle, making it more difficult."

469,00:28:16.88,00:28:16.88,We are neck and neck! Matty and Kenny made up a lot
470,00:28:20.58,00:28:20.58,of time. Got to get back to the mat.
471,00:28:24.38,00:28:24.38,Then you can start work working on the flagpole.
472,00:28:28.42,00:28:28.42,"Get back, Kenny. You got to get back!"
473,00:28:30.17,00:28:30.17,">> Get up! >> Come on, Kenny!"

475,00:28:35.88,00:28:35.88,first. Then you start working

477,00:28:44.29,00:28:44.29,That's not it! >> PROBST: This is where

482,00:29:06.08,00:29:06.08,Ace trying to muscle it in. All the pieces will interlock.
483,00:29:10.08,00:29:10.08,You don't need to force anything.
484,00:29:14.17,00:29:14.17,Kota quickly working together on assembling their flagpole.
485,00:29:17.50,00:29:17.50,>> It's not going in! >> PROBST: Ace still struggling 
486,00:29:20.25,00:29:20.25,to make sense of this. (cheering)
487,00:29:28.50,00:29:28.50,"Kota wins immunity once again! >> Good job, guys!"
488,00:29:32.29,00:29:32.29,>> Yes! >> Yes!

492,00:29:55.79,00:29:55.79,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
493,00:29:57.96,00:29:57.96,">> Thanks, Jeff. >> PROBST: And Fang, once again,"
494,00:30:00.21,00:30:00.21,"Tribal Council, all yours. And if you continue to play"
495,00:30:03.75,00:30:03.75,"like individuals, you'll be there every time."
496,00:30:06.12,00:30:06.12,"Tonight, one of the six of you going home."
497,00:30:08.71,00:30:08.71,You have the afternoon to figure out who it's going to be.
498,00:30:10.54,00:30:10.54,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
499,00:30:12.88,00:30:12.88,>> Ace is a tyrant and a bully and a lot of people see Ace as
500,00:30:16.92,00:30:16.92,"a strong competitor, but he's been in our tribe for three or"
501,00:30:19.12,00:30:19.12,"four challenges now, and we haven't won anything."
502,00:30:22.38,00:30:22.38,"So, how is he benefiting me? \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
503,00:30:42.12,00:30:42.12,>> The challenge was challenging.
504,00:30:43.83,00:30:43.83,There were a couple of people that died right at the end.
505,00:30:46.33,00:30:46.33,"I was expecting more from Kelly, and she really just sort"
506,00:30:48.79,00:30:48.79,"of petered out. She goes, it strengthens the"
507,00:30:52.12,00:30:52.12,"team, and I think she's just irritating and really dumb."
508,00:30:56.46,00:30:56.46,Kelly's going home tonight. It would be stupid not to send
509,00:30:59.17,00:30:59.17,"her. >> All right, don't get mad at"
510,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33,"me when I say this, but, uh, if we, if we merge at nine..."
511,00:31:05.12,00:31:05.12,>> Yeah. >> And we go into the last
512,00:31:07.08,00:31:07.08,"three ,and it's going to be you, Sugar or me, she can play the"
513,00:31:10.50,00:31:10.50,"idol and I can leave, dude. I think we should flush the"
514,00:31:14.12,00:31:14.12,"idol tonight. You and I and her, that's too"
515,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,much of a risk. Why can't we play it tonight?
516,00:31:20.58,00:31:20.58,">> Matty, look at me. She can't play the idol."
517,00:31:23.21,00:31:23.21,Trust me. >> If it's us three...
518,00:31:24.75,00:31:24.75,">> Trust me. >> Okay, all right, I trust"
519,00:31:26.67,00:31:26.67,you then. >> Matty wanted to get the idol
520,00:31:29.71,00:31:29.71,out and I just tried to convey to him that he doesn't really
521,00:31:32.96,00:31:32.96,have to worry about that to that extent because although I don't
522,00:31:36.04,00:31:36.04,"want to tell him I have the idol; obviously, I do."
523,00:31:39.08,00:31:39.08,"Man, don't worry about the idol. I promise we'll take care of it."
524,00:31:44.50,00:31:44.50,">> All right. Kelly, then."
525,00:31:46.04,00:31:46.04,>> Kelly. >> Okay.
526,00:31:47.79,00:31:47.79,>> The alliance is sound. I would hope to trust Matty.
527,00:31:50.21,00:31:50.21,Sugar I pretty much trust completely.
528,00:31:52.54,00:31:52.54,I don't see any reason why Kenny would not go with what it
529,00:31:54.96,00:31:54.96,"is, and I think it makes sense for everyone to get rid of"
530,00:31:56.88,00:31:56.88,Kelly. >> Why not?
531,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,>> Because it's not going to work.
532,00:32:10.08,00:32:10.08,That's what I tried to run by Ace right when I got here.
533,00:32:12.12,00:32:12.12,>> Why do you trust Ace? >> Who said I did?
534,00:32:15.21,00:32:15.21,">> Well, then, when you went to talk to him in the woods, what"
535,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,did you ask him? What did he say?
536,00:32:20.79,00:32:20.79,">> He said, ""Kelly."" ""Kelly."""
537,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,"I said, ""I guess. That sound good to me, dude."""
538,00:32:27.79,00:32:27.79,>> I really want Ace out of here.
539,00:32:29.50,00:32:29.50,>> We can't vote Ace off. We have to win a freaking

541,00:32:33.25,00:32:33.25,he's been here? Okay.
542,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,>> I don't know what's going through Matty's head.
543,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,He's running and telling Ace everything and Ace ain't
544,00:32:39.25,00:32:39.25,running and telling him anything.
545,00:32:40.88,00:32:40.88,>> Let's just get out Kelly. I don't know why we have to
546,00:32:42.79,00:32:42.79,get... Let's just start with this.
547,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,>> Okay. I'm still very leery of Ace and
548,00:32:50.58,00:32:50.58,"Sugar because they are in an alliance, and Kenny, myself,"
549,00:32:55.42,00:32:55.42,"and Matty, we have to be leery of everything that's going on"
550,00:32:58.33,00:32:58.33,around us. >> Something is up tonight.
551,00:33:05.50,00:33:05.50,">> Matty... >> No, no. "
552,00:33:07.04,00:33:07.04,">> He's just riding the fence. >> Right now, the safest best is"
553,00:33:09.83,00:33:09.83,to write down Kelly. >> Ace is probably writing down
554,00:33:11.71,00:33:11.71,Kelly. Sugar is writing down Kelly.
555,00:33:13.92,00:33:13.92,>> Matty is writing down Kelly. >> Matty is writing down Kelly.
556,00:33:17.17,00:33:17.17,"Right now, I'm really torn 'cause I really want Ace out of"
557,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,here. >> Do we trust Ace or Kelly?
558,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,I don't trust Ace. >> I don't trust Ace.

560,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,"Crystal is on to something. Right now, know what Crystal"
561,00:33:32.38,00:33:32.38,"told me? She told me that, ""Yeah, I'm"
562,00:33:34.12,00:33:34.12,"worried about Matty, that he's flipping."""
563,00:33:35.50,00:33:35.50,"And I'm like, ""Don't worry. We're sticking together."""
564,00:33:37.17,00:33:37.17,"Crystal said, ""Okay."" >> All that we have to know is"
565,00:33:39.46,00:33:39.46,that Kelly goes next. That's it.
566,00:33:41.17,00:33:41.17,That's all we have to know right now.
567,00:33:42.46,00:33:42.46,>> Or blindside Ace. >> I can't.
568,00:33:44.25,00:33:44.25,I made a promise that I can't break.
569,00:33:46.25,00:33:46.25,">> Yeah, but, man, you can't trust someone like that when"
570,00:33:48.54,00:33:48.54,they say they have an agreement. >> We made a serious agreement.
571,00:33:51.04,00:33:51.04,He swore on his mother. >> You got to think it over.
572,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,"Matty, like, you just can't take anybody's word."
573,00:33:56.38,00:33:56.38,"In order for you and me to guarantee to make the merge,"
574,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,we have to blindside Ace and then that's a guaranteed merge
575,00:34:01.96,00:34:01.96,for you and me. I don't trust Ace at all.
576,00:34:04.21,00:34:04.21,I know he's sneaky. I know he has alliances
577,00:34:06.79,00:34:06.79,back in the Kota tribe. And Sugar's going to go with Ace
578,00:34:09.21,00:34:09.21,"no matter what. So I was like, I had to talk to"
579,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,"Sugar on a one-on-one basis. It's weird 'cause his game, you"
580,00:34:16.17,00:34:16.17,"see people who are really honest and sweet, kind of get, like,"
581,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,their heads chopped off by people like...
582,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,>> That's why I connected with Ace.
583,00:34:23.21,00:34:23.21,>> By people like... >> Ace.
584,00:34:25.67,00:34:25.67,>> Ace. (laughs)
585,00:34:27.21,00:34:27.21,"So I figured, you know, maybe we could stick together."
586,00:34:35.75,00:34:35.75,">> I know. I know, huh?"
587,00:34:41.42,00:34:41.42,>> I was so shocked today when Sugar told me that she gave the
588,00:34:44.62,00:34:44.62,"hidden immunity idol to Ace. And I was like, ""Wait. What?!"""
589,00:34:48.29,00:34:48.29,"Since you gave the idol to Ace, that just shows that you he"
590,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,"is... >> Well, he didn't ask for it. "
591,00:34:53.71,00:34:53.71,I gave it to him. >> You just gave it to him on
592,00:34:55.08,00:34:55.08,your own will. >> Yeah.
593,00:34:56.21,00:34:56.21,"He didn't, like, talk me out of it or anything, but I know Ace"
594,00:34:58.25,00:34:58.25,"is a sneak. >> Yeah, he's very sleazy."
595,00:35:07.54,00:35:07.54,>> I just wanted to let you know that they took the idol out
596,00:35:10.00,00:35:10.00,"of your bag-- I mean, out of your jacket-- so you don't think"
597,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,"that somebody else did it. >> Oh, okay."
598,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,">> But I don't think I need to play it, right?"
599,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,>> No. >> You're sure I'm good?
600,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,">> Yeah. >> Okay, cool."
601,00:35:18.92,00:35:18.92,>> All right. >> All right.
602,00:35:24.08,00:35:24.08,">> I told Sugar, ""Always keep the idol with you, you know."
603,00:35:27.29,00:35:27.29,"In case something happens."" I just made sure that it's not"
604,00:35:30.58,00:35:30.58,"in the snake's hands, Ace's hands and it's back to Sugar's"
605,00:35:33.21,00:35:33.21,"hands. >> Uh, the deal with Sugar and"
606,00:35:36.92,00:35:36.92,"the idol is she has it, and I think it's quite possible Sugar"
607,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,"thinks ""I've used Ace to the extent that I can."""
608,00:35:44.00,00:35:44.00,I'm not particularly worried in relation to my own regard at the
609,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,moment. I'm going in confident.
610,00:35:49.42,00:35:49.42,That could be the worst thing possible.
611,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,"(Probst sighs) >> PROBST: So, out of ten"
612,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,"challenges, you have won two. Matty, what is the mood of this"
613,00:36:16.62,00:36:16.62,tribe? >> We're... cursed.
614,00:36:20.62,00:36:20.62,(laughing) There's something in our water.
615,00:36:22.71,00:36:22.71,There's something in our rice. But I think we have a curse.
616,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,">> PROBST: Kelly, what's your take on this tribe?"
617,00:36:28.25,00:36:28.25,">> Um, we just can't come, like, as a team, and just, like, work"
618,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,together. >> PROBST: I think Kelly hit it
619,00:36:34.08,00:36:34.08,on the head. What I saw today at the
620,00:36:35.75,00:36:35.75,challenge is a group of people working as individuals.
621,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,">> Jeff, when it came to putting that flag and pole"
622,00:36:42.46,00:36:42.46,"together, I really, honestly felt like Ace wanted to be the"
623,00:36:45.62,00:36:45.62,"person to put it all together. ""We got to try this."""
624,00:36:48.21,00:36:48.21,"We got to try this."" I'm like, ""We can all piece it"
625,00:36:50.71,00:36:50.71,"together."" >> PROBST: Ace, do you think"
626,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,"you guys were effective in how you were working at the end,"
627,00:36:54.58,00:36:54.58,trying to put that flag together?
628,00:36:55.92,00:36:55.92,">> No, we didn't come together as a group."
629,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,And I think I can apportion definitely a larger percentage
630,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,of the blame for how it went together at the end.
631,00:37:06.88,00:37:06.88,">> PROBST: Crystal, would it be fair to give Ace a vote,"
632,00:37:09.21,00:37:09.21,"simply because you thought you knew how to do it, and you"
633,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,didn't? >> Yes.
634,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,">> PROBST: Surprise you, Ace? >> Nothing surprises me in"
635,00:37:16.04,00:37:16.04,"Tribal Council, honestly. >> PROBST: Crystal, you've"
636,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,been upset at a lot of challenges.
637,00:37:22.33,00:37:22.33,Tears have come out often. Do you think it's starting to
638,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"have an impact? >> Oh, definitely."
639,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,Some of my tribemates tend to take it as weakness and will
640,00:37:31.00,00:37:31.00,very well use it against me tonight.
641,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,">> PROBST: Kelly, you're nodding your head."
642,00:37:34.92,00:37:34.92,">> Um, I never said she was weak, but when somebody cries,"
643,00:37:37.71,00:37:37.71,"it's just like, ""Why are you crying?"""
644,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,"Clearly something is, like, you're just not stable."
645,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,>> You don't know where my tears come from.
646,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,"Yeah, I'm hurt because we're losing."
647,00:37:46.04,00:37:46.04,We're not eating. We're not winning.
648,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"And if you don't understand that, you won't last too much"
649,00:37:50.54,00:37:50.54,longer in the game yourself. >> Okay...
650,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,>> And you took me crying one time as a sign of weakness?
651,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,"I don't think so. >> Okay, well, I didn't say that"
652,00:37:57.46,00:37:57.46,"you were weak, so you can take what you want."
653,00:37:59.92,00:37:59.92,">> Next question, please. >> PROBST: Now, Kelly didn't say"
654,00:38:02.96,00:38:02.96,you were weak. Kelly said you were unstable.
655,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,">> Yeah, that's worse. >> She didn't explain to us why"
656,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,she was crying. I asked is her afterwards if she
657,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,was okay. She told me...
658,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,You don't have to explain. It's understood.
659,00:38:12.29,00:38:12.29,And sometimes you don't have to have things written out in black
660,00:38:14.25,00:38:14.25,and white. I'm not crying over no doggone
661,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,"danishes, okay? Really, it gets frustrating,"
662,00:38:19.75,00:38:19.75,Kelly; it really does. We've been down and out from
663,00:38:22.38,00:38:22.38,day one. But you wouldn't understand it
664,00:38:25.12,00:38:25.12,because you came from a a winning situation.
665,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,">> I'm not banging her down. Like, I just saw her cry."
666,00:38:29.54,00:38:29.54,That doesn't mean anything. I wasn't the only one talking 
667,00:38:31.62,00:38:31.62,about it. Ace talked about it...
668,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,">> Whoa, before you start to try and throw people under busses"
669,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"for no apparent reason, the only thing I said about Crystal was I"
670,00:38:39.08,00:38:39.08,actually understood because it's frustrating losing over and
671,00:38:42.42,00:38:42.42,"over again, just so it drives you up the wall."
672,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,">> PROBST: Kelly, the whole time Ace was talking, you had a"
673,00:38:48.21,00:38:48.21,"look on your face like, ""Not true."""
674,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,">> He is 100% double-talking and it's just just so annoying, I"
675,00:38:53.29,00:38:53.29,"just, like, don't even know how to explain it."
676,00:38:55.38,00:38:55.38,">> Honestly, Kelly, I would be impressed if you understood"
677,00:38:57.46,00:38:57.46,what I was saying half the time. >> He always has to have the
678,00:39:00.50,00:39:00.50,last word. It's disgusting.
679,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,">> PROBST: Matty, you seem like one of the few guys tonight who"
680,00:39:08.71,00:39:08.71,might have reason to actually not be worried.
681,00:39:11.17,00:39:11.17,">> There's no sort of semblance or logic in this tribe, though."
682,00:39:15.38,00:39:15.38,>> PROBST: That must be maddening when you get to the
683,00:39:17.04,00:39:17.04,"vote. There are so many people,"
684,00:39:18.67,00:39:18.67,"tonight, it feels like, that are on the chopping block."
685,00:39:21.38,00:39:21.38,>> It could be any one of us. It really could be any single
686,00:39:24.25,00:39:24.25,"one of us tonight. >> PROBST: Well, it sounds like"
687,00:39:27.17,00:39:27.17,it's going to be an interesting vote.
688,00:39:29.29,00:39:29.29,"It is time to vote. Ace, you're up."
689,00:39:41.38,00:39:41.38,">> My dear, this has been a been a long time in the coming."
690,00:39:44.62,00:39:44.62,"Hopefully, it happens tonight. >> Forget you."
691,00:40:12.62,00:40:12.62,Go home. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
692,00:40:20.17,00:40:20.17,votes. If anybody has the hidden
693,00:40:31.29,00:40:31.29,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
694,00:40:34.08,00:40:34.08,to do so. Okay.
695,00:40:39.96,00:40:39.96,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
696,00:40:42.12,00:40:42.12,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
697,00:40:43.58,00:40:43.58,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
698,00:40:48.96,00:40:48.96,First vote: Kelly. Crystal.
699,00:40:55.04,00:40:55.04,One vote Kelly; one vote Crystal.
700,00:40:59.04,00:40:59.04,Kelly. Two votes Kelly;
701,00:41:01.50,00:41:01.50,one vote Crystal. Kelly.
702,00:41:06.33,00:41:06.33,That's three votes Kelly; one vote Crystal.
703,00:41:11.12,00:41:11.12,Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Gabon: Kelly.
704,00:41:13.38,00:41:13.38,That's four. That's enough.
705,00:41:15.67,00:41:15.67,"You need to bring me your torch. Kelly, the tribe has spoken."
706,00:41:29.00,00:41:29.00,"Time for you to go. Well, tonight was the first"
707,00:41:48.17,00:41:48.17,Tribal Council that I saw some true passion.
708,00:41:51.79,00:41:51.79,Maybe that's what's been missing.
709,00:41:53.58,00:41:53.58,Time will tell. Grab your torches.
710,00:41:55.12,00:41:55.12,Head back to camp. Good night.

716,00:42:18.04,00:42:18.04,Both tribes are going to vote somebody out.
717,00:42:21.00,00:42:21.00,>> Susie has made it far enough in this game.
718,00:42:22.67,00:42:22.67,>> Blindside Ace. >> Blindside Ace.
719,00:42:24.67,00:42:24.67,">> Take Marcus out. >> Kenny, Crystal, and I vote"
720,00:42:27.25,00:42:27.25,for Sugar. >> I think it's going to be 
721,00:42:28.54,00:42:28.54,Dan. >> Crystal thinks Kenny's

724,00:42:33.88,00:42:33.88,>> Okay. >> I was actually going to vote
725,00:42:35.29,00:42:35.29,"you. >> I voted for Crystal because,"
726,00:42:42.58,00:42:42.58,you know what? She doesn't really have the
727,00:42:44.21,00:42:44.21,power to push a team when she's the one quitting half the
728,00:42:47.21,00:42:47.21,challenges. I think the Fang tribe is still
729,00:42:50.00,00:42:50.00,cursed. I think they're still going to
730,00:42:51.29,00:42:51.29,go down. They need to work together.
731,00:42:53.54,00:42:53.54,"Maybe tonight's Tribal Council, they'll communicate better,"
732,00:42:55.79,00:42:55.79,"but I definitely wanted to stay in the game, but, you know,"
733,00:42:57.46,00:42:57.46,"if it's my time to go, it's my time to go."
