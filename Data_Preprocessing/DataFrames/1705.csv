291,00:17:49.08,00:17:49.08,>> I knew that they wereprobably going to send me back
292,00:17:51.96,00:17:51.96,to Exile.This is lame.
293,00:17:54.00,00:17:54.00,Why-why...Why do I get to come back here
294,00:18:01.46,00:18:01.46,and...Eat fruit when everybody is
295,00:18:04.42,00:18:04.42,"starving at my tribe, andthey're running out of food,"
296,00:18:07.12,00:18:07.12,and they don't have anythingbut rice.
297,00:18:08.96,00:18:08.96,And I'm feeling really guilty.I just feel bad knowing that I
298,00:18:17.54,00:18:17.54,"already have the idol.Actually, I gave Ace the idol in"
299,00:18:21.21,00:18:21.21,"case he needs it before Tribal,but..."
300,00:18:25.33,00:18:25.33,"Well, we'll see if that happens.>> I wouldn't mind getting some"

304,00:18:40.25,00:18:40.25,going to be super hot.So we might as well get

306,00:18:45.08,00:18:45.08,>> I don't know why you'restressing over it.
307,00:18:47.88,00:18:47.88,">> I'm not stressing.>> Yes, you are."
308,00:18:51.25,00:18:51.25,>> Fang lost another challenge.We needed that food because

310,00:18:58.08,00:18:58.08,"of rice.And then, Crystal's reaction"
311,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,"of our loss was huge.She just, like, broke down in"
312,00:19:03.25,00:19:03.25,"tears.Personally, I just think her"

314,00:19:10.50,00:19:10.50,"Like, seriously, that all just,like, sucks."
315,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,"It's like a damper on the team.Like, you don't need to cry,"
316,00:19:16.58,00:19:16.58,"right?>> Well, it's just a different"
317,00:19:18.62,00:19:18.62,sort of cry than uh...Sugar's cry is more a...

320,00:19:31.25,00:19:31.25,>> Don't view my tears attoday's challenge as a sign of
321,00:19:34.96,00:19:34.96,weakness.Because it's far from that.
322,00:19:40.04,00:19:40.04,You and Kelly view me as weaknow because I was crying?
323,00:19:42.58,00:19:42.58,">> Not weak.>> Where did they go, up by the"
324,00:19:45.38,00:19:45.38,hill or they went by tree mail?>> By tree mail and by the hill.
325,00:19:49.67,00:19:49.67,">> I hope that they don't putme in the same category as GC,"
326,00:19:53.04,00:19:53.04,someone that wants to give up.Because shortly after I got
327,00:19:56.54,00:19:56.54,"back to camp, I snapped out ofmy funk."
328,00:19:58.50,00:19:58.50,"But Kelly hasn't had two wordsto say to me, and so now she's"
329,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,going to feel the wrath ofCrystal.
330,00:20:04.04,00:20:04.04,">> Hey, how did you get here?>> Same way you got here."

332,00:20:08.54,00:20:08.54,">> Are you feeling better?>> Yeah, I mean, y'all have"
333,00:20:11.71,00:20:11.71,already had the comforts offood.
334,00:20:13.54,00:20:13.54,"I mean, you guys have had fish.I've had a pinch of a freaking"
335,00:20:19.08,00:20:19.08,sardine.You know what I'm saying?
336,00:20:21.08,00:20:21.08,">> Mm-hmm.>> But, like I tell you and like"
337,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,I tell everybody else in mytribe: don't mistake my tears
338,00:20:25.67,00:20:25.67,"as a sign of weakness becauseat some point, we all get"
339,00:20:28.79,00:20:28.79,depressed.It's just that mine come out
340,00:20:30.67,00:20:30.67,"through my eyes, you know.I mean, I think I can still"
341,00:20:33.92,00:20:33.92,battle with the best of themand just don't mistake it as a
342,00:20:36.83,00:20:36.83,sign of weakness because it'snot.
343,00:20:38.21,00:20:38.21,But I'm fine now.>> I definitely think that
344,00:20:40.79,00:20:40.79,"Crystal crying in front ofthe Kota tribe and our tribe, it"
345,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,"shows a sign of weakness.Like, you could take it"
346,00:20:45.46,00:20:45.46,"either which way, you know.Like, she can explain it to us,"
347,00:20:47.79,00:20:47.79,but she can't explain it to theKota tribe.
348,00:20:50.08,00:20:50.08,">> I think more so with me, itwasn't the danish, it was the"
349,00:20:52.42,00:20:52.42,"pride.>> It just sucks,"
350,00:20:54.67,00:20:54.67,"especially when you lose,and we lose every time."
351,00:21:11.46,00:21:11.46,>> Marcus.A giant turtle.
352,00:21:13.67,00:21:13.67,">> A giant turtle?>> Not giant, but big enough."
353,00:21:16.25,00:21:16.25,">> Okay, hold on, hold on.Hold on."
354,00:21:20.25,00:21:20.25,Let me give you my shirt orsomething.
355,00:21:22.12,00:21:22.12,Untie me.I'll bring the boat around.
356,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,>> Your hands are too important.Hold on.
357,00:21:27.92,00:21:27.92,>> Listen to me.I don't want you to lose your
358,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,hand.>> It doesn't matter.
359,00:21:31.21,00:21:31.21,It's food.>> Whoo!
360,00:21:33.54,00:21:33.54,">> All right, we've got aturtle!"
361,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,I was really excited because itwas like winning a reward
362,00:21:38.12,00:21:38.12,"challenge, except we did itourselves, so it had that extra"
363,00:21:41.92,00:21:41.92,bit of joy to it.>> That is neat.
364,00:21:43.67,00:21:43.67,">> You know...You know how to cook that,"
365,00:21:44.88,00:21:44.88,right?>> That's good size.
366,00:21:46.12,00:21:46.12,">> Kill it and then crack theshell, break it out, and cut it"
367,00:21:49.38,00:21:49.38,in cubes and boil it.>> Wow.
368,00:21:50.79,00:21:50.79,>> Go for it.I'm excited about it.
369,00:21:52.33,00:21:52.33,I think it's going to tastegood.
370,00:21:53.71,00:21:53.71,Have you ever had gumbo turtlesoup here in the jungles of
371,00:21:58.25,00:21:58.25,Africa?How cool is that?
372,00:21:59.79,00:21:59.79,>> It's going to be delish.I know it.

566,00:33:42.46,00:33:42.46,>> Or blindside Ace.>> I can't.
567,00:33:44.25,00:33:44.25,I made a promise that I can'tbreak.
568,00:33:46.25,00:33:46.25,">> Yeah, but, man, you can'ttrust someone like that when"
569,00:33:48.54,00:33:48.54,they say they have an agreement.>> We made a serious agreement.
570,00:33:51.04,00:33:51.04,He swore on his mother.>> You got to think it over.
571,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,"Matty, like, you just can't takeanybody's word."
572,00:33:56.38,00:33:56.38,"In order for you and me toguarantee to make the merge,"
573,00:33:59.17,00:33:59.17,we have to blindside Ace andthen that's a guaranteed merge
574,00:34:01.96,00:34:01.96,for you and me.I don't trust Ace at all.
575,00:34:04.21,00:34:04.21,I know he's sneaky.I know he has alliances
576,00:34:06.79,00:34:06.79,back in the Kota tribe.And Sugar's going to go with Ace
577,00:34:09.21,00:34:09.21,"no matter what.So I was like, I had to talk to"
578,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,"Sugar on a one-on-one basis.It's weird 'cause his game, you"
579,00:34:16.17,00:34:16.17,"see people who are really honestand sweet, kind of get, like,"
580,00:34:20.08,00:34:20.08,their heads chopped off bypeople like...
581,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,>> That's why I connected withAce.
582,00:34:23.21,00:34:23.21,>> By people like...>> Ace.
583,00:34:25.67,00:34:25.67,>> Ace.(laughs)
584,00:34:27.21,00:34:27.21,"So I figured, you know, maybewe could stick together."
585,00:34:35.75,00:34:35.75,">> I know.I know, huh?"
586,00:34:41.42,00:34:41.42,>> I was so shocked today whenSugar told me that she gave the
587,00:34:44.62,00:34:44.62,"hidden immunity idol to Ace.And I was like, ""Wait. What?!"""
588,00:34:48.29,00:34:48.29,"Since you gave the idol toAce, that just shows that you he"
589,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,"is...>> Well, he didn't ask for it. "
590,00:34:53.71,00:34:53.71,I gave it to him.>> You just gave it to him on
591,00:34:55.08,00:34:55.08,your own will.>> Yeah.
592,00:34:56.21,00:34:56.21,"He didn't, like, talk me out ofit or anything, but I know Ace"
593,00:34:58.25,00:34:58.25,"is a sneak.>> Yeah, he's very sleazy."
594,00:35:07.54,00:35:07.54,>> I just wanted to let youknow that they took the idol out
595,00:35:10.00,00:35:10.00,"of your bag-- I mean, out ofyour jacket-- so you don't think"
596,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,"that somebody else did it.>> Oh, okay."
597,00:35:14.17,00:35:14.17,">> But I don't think I need toplay it, right?"
598,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,>> No.>> You're sure I'm good?
599,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,">> Yeah.>> Okay, cool."
600,00:35:18.92,00:35:18.92,>> All right.>> All right.
601,00:35:24.08,00:35:24.08,">> I told Sugar, ""Always keepthe idol with you, you know."
602,00:35:27.29,00:35:27.29,"In case something happens.""I just made sure that it's not"
603,00:35:30.58,00:35:30.58,"in the snake's hands, Ace'shands and it's back to Sugar's"
604,00:35:33.21,00:35:33.21,"hands.>> Uh, the deal with Sugar and"
605,00:35:36.92,00:35:36.92,"the idol is she has it, and Ithink it's quite possible Sugar"
606,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,"thinks ""I've used Ace to theextent that I can."""
607,00:35:44.00,00:35:44.00,I'm not particularly worried inrelation to my own regard at the
608,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,moment.I'm going in confident.
609,00:35:49.42,00:35:49.42,That could be the worst thingpossible.
610,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,"(Probst sighs)>> PROBST: So, out of ten"
611,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,"challenges, you have won two.Matty, what is the mood of this"
612,00:36:16.62,00:36:16.62,tribe?>> We're... cursed.
613,00:36:20.62,00:36:20.62,(laughing)There's something in our water.
614,00:36:22.71,00:36:22.71,There's something in our rice.But I think we have a curse.
615,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,">> PROBST: Kelly, what's yourtake on this tribe?"
616,00:36:28.25,00:36:28.25,">> Um, we just can't come, like,as a team, and just, like, work"
617,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,together.>> PROBST: I think Kelly hit it
618,00:36:34.08,00:36:34.08,on the head.What I saw today at the
619,00:36:35.75,00:36:35.75,challenge is a group of peopleworking as individuals.
620,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,">> Jeff, when it came toputting that flag and pole"
621,00:36:42.46,00:36:42.46,"together, I really, honestlyfelt like Ace wanted to be the"
622,00:36:45.62,00:36:45.62,"person to put it all together.""We got to try this."""
623,00:36:48.21,00:36:48.21,"We got to try this.""I'm like, ""We can all piece it"
624,00:36:50.71,00:36:50.71,"together."">> PROBST: Ace, do you think"
625,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,"you guys were effective in howyou were working at the end,"
626,00:36:54.58,00:36:54.58,trying to put that flagtogether?
627,00:36:55.92,00:36:55.92,">> No, we didn't come togetheras a group."
628,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,And I think I can apportiondefinitely a larger percentage
629,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,of the blame for how it wenttogether at the end.
630,00:37:06.88,00:37:06.88,">> PROBST: Crystal, would itbe fair to give Ace a vote,"
631,00:37:09.21,00:37:09.21,"simply because you thought youknew how to do it, and you"
632,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,didn't?>> Yes.
633,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,">> PROBST: Surprise you, Ace?>> Nothing surprises me in"
634,00:37:16.04,00:37:16.04,"Tribal Council, honestly.>> PROBST: Crystal, you've"
635,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,been upset at a lot ofchallenges.
636,00:37:22.33,00:37:22.33,Tears have come out often.Do you think it's starting to
637,00:37:25.21,00:37:25.21,"have an impact?>> Oh, definitely."
638,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,Some of my tribemates tend totake it as weakness and will
639,00:37:31.00,00:37:31.00,very well use it against metonight.
640,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,">> PROBST: Kelly, you'renodding your head."
641,00:37:34.92,00:37:34.92,">> Um, I never said she wasweak, but when somebody cries,"
642,00:37:37.71,00:37:37.71,"it's just like, ""Why are youcrying?"""
643,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,"Clearly something is, like,you're just not stable."
644,00:37:42.79,00:37:42.79,>> You don't know where mytears come from.
645,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,"Yeah, I'm hurt because we'relosing."
646,00:37:46.04,00:37:46.04,We're not eating.We're not winning.
647,00:37:48.08,00:37:48.08,"And if you don't understandthat, you won't last too much"
648,00:37:50.54,00:37:50.54,longer in the game yourself.>> Okay...
649,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,>> And you took me crying onetime as a sign of weakness?
650,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,"I don't think so.>> Okay, well, I didn't say that"
651,00:37:57.46,00:37:57.46,"you were weak, so you can takewhat you want."
652,00:37:59.92,00:37:59.92,">> Next question, please.>> PROBST: Now, Kelly didn't say"
653,00:38:02.96,00:38:02.96,you were weak.Kelly said you were unstable.
654,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,">> Yeah, that's worse.>> She didn't explain to us why"
655,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,she was crying.I asked is her afterwards if she
656,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,was okay.She told me...
657,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,You don't have to explain.It's understood.
658,00:38:12.29,00:38:12.29,And sometimes you don't have tohave things written out in black
659,00:38:14.25,00:38:14.25,and white.I'm not crying over no doggone
660,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,"danishes, okay?Really, it gets frustrating,"
661,00:38:19.75,00:38:19.75,Kelly; it really does.We've been down and out from
662,00:38:22.38,00:38:22.38,day one.But you wouldn't understand it
663,00:38:25.12,00:38:25.12,because you came from aa winning situation.
664,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,">> I'm not banging her down.Like, I just saw her cry."
665,00:38:29.54,00:38:29.54,That doesn't mean anything.I wasn't the only one talking 
666,00:38:31.62,00:38:31.62,about it.Ace talked about it...
667,00:38:33.04,00:38:33.04,">> Whoa, before you start to tryand throw people under busses"
668,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"for no apparent reason, the onlything I said about Crystal was I"
669,00:38:39.08,00:38:39.08,actually understood becauseit's frustrating losing over and
670,00:38:42.42,00:38:42.42,"over again, just so it drivesyou up the wall."
671,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,">> PROBST: Kelly, the wholetime Ace was talking, you had a"
672,00:38:48.21,00:38:48.21,"look on your face like, ""Nottrue."""
673,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,">> He is 100% double-talking andit's just just so annoying, I"
674,00:38:53.29,00:38:53.29,"just, like, don't even know howto explain it."
675,00:38:55.38,00:38:55.38,">> Honestly, Kelly, I wouldbe impressed if you understood"
676,00:38:57.46,00:38:57.46,what I was saying half the time.>> He always has to have the
677,00:39:00.50,00:39:00.50,last word.It's disgusting.
678,00:39:05.04,00:39:05.04,">> PROBST: Matty, you seem likeone of the few guys tonight who"
679,00:39:08.71,00:39:08.71,might have reason to actuallynot be worried.
680,00:39:11.17,00:39:11.17,">> There's no sort of semblanceor logic in this tribe, though."
681,00:39:15.38,00:39:15.38,>> PROBST: That must bemaddening when you get to the
682,00:39:17.04,00:39:17.04,"vote.There are so many people,"
683,00:39:18.67,00:39:18.67,"tonight, it feels like, thatare on the chopping block."
684,00:39:21.38,00:39:21.38,>> It could be any one of us.It really could be any single
685,00:39:24.25,00:39:24.25,"one of us tonight.>> PROBST: Well, it sounds like"
686,00:39:27.17,00:39:27.17,it's going to be an interestingvote.
687,00:39:29.29,00:39:29.29,"It is time to vote.Ace, you're up."
688,00:39:41.38,00:39:41.38,">> My dear, this has been abeen a long time in the coming."
689,00:39:44.62,00:39:44.62,"Hopefully, it happens tonight.>> Forget you."
690,00:40:12.62,00:40:12.62,Go home.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
691,00:40:20.17,00:40:20.17,votes.If anybody has the hidden
692,00:40:31.29,00:40:31.29,"immunity idol and you want toplay it, now would be the time"
693,00:40:34.08,00:40:34.08,to do so.Okay.
694,00:40:39.96,00:40:39.96,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
695,00:40:42.12,00:40:42.12,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
696,00:40:43.58,00:40:43.58,Council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
697,00:40:48.96,00:40:48.96,First vote: Kelly.Crystal.
698,00:40:55.04,00:40:55.04,One vote Kelly;one vote Crystal.
699,00:40:59.04,00:40:59.04,Kelly.Two votes Kelly;
700,00:41:01.50,00:41:01.50,one vote Crystal.Kelly.
701,00:41:06.33,00:41:06.33,That's three votes Kelly;one vote Crystal.
702,00:41:11.12,00:41:11.12,Sixth person voted out ofSurvivor: Gabon: Kelly.
703,00:41:13.38,00:41:13.38,That's four.That's enough.
704,00:41:15.67,00:41:15.67,"You need to bring me your torch.Kelly, the tribe has spoken."
705,00:41:29.00,00:41:29.00,"Time for you to go.Well, tonight was the first"
706,00:41:48.17,00:41:48.17,Tribal Council that I saw sometrue passion.
707,00:41:51.79,00:41:51.79,Maybe that's what's beenmissing.
708,00:41:53.58,00:41:53.58,Time will tell.Grab your torches.
709,00:41:55.12,00:41:55.12,Head back to camp.Good night.

727,00:42:47.21,00:42:47.21,challenges.I think the Fang tribe is still
728,00:42:50.00,00:42:50.00,cursed.I think they're still going to
729,00:42:51.29,00:42:51.29,go down.They need to work together.
730,00:42:53.54,00:42:53.54,"Maybe tonight's Tribal Council,they'll communicate better,"
