1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF: Previously on Survivor:
2,00:00:02.92,00:00:02.92,Erik was the last man left in the game.
3,00:00:05.38,00:00:05.38,And the women's alliance desperately wanted him out.
4,00:00:08.25,00:00:08.25,>> It's us and Erik. >> We need to figure out what we
5,00:00:10.67,00:00:10.67,need to do. >> JEFF: But when he won the
6,00:00:13.21,00:00:13.21,"immunity challenge, Erik threw a wrench into their plans."
7,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,>> What are we all thinking? >> I couldn't win against
8,00:00:18.62,00:00:18.62,"Amanda. >> JEFF: So Natalie, Alexis, and"
9,00:00:22.71,00:00:22.71,"Erik decided to vote out Amanda. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Da, da, da, da. \xe2\x99\xaa"
10,00:00:26.04,00:00:26.04,">> JEFF: Cirie was still tight with Amanda and Parvati, but"
11,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,"reluctant to force a tie. >> So what do I do, make it a"
12,00:00:31.17,00:00:31.17,tie? >> You know that I would.
13,00:00:40.08,00:00:40.08,">> JEFF: At tribal council, Amanda tore into Erik for"
14,00:00:43.00,00:00:43.00,turning his back on her. >> I helped you stay here
15,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,"through the merge, and then I was asking for your help, and"
16,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83,you clearly denied me of that. >> JEFF: Then Amanda pulled off
17,00:00:50.71,00:00:50.71,the biggest blindside yet by playing the hidden immunity
18,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,idol. >> \xe2\x99\xaa But I got it. \xe2\x99\xaa
19,00:00:56.79,00:00:56.79,>> JEFF: The rest of the tribe was stunned as Alexis was sent
20,00:00:58.92,00:00:58.92,"home. Alexis, the tribe has spoken."
21,00:01:02.04,00:01:02.04,Only five are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
22,00:01:16.42,00:01:16.42,>> I didn't have it when I told you guys I didn't have it.
23,00:01:21.12,00:01:21.12,"I got it afterwards. >> Whoo-ee, tribal council, boy,"
24,00:01:25.38,00:01:25.38,"is getting dangerous, from the idols floating around and people"
25,00:01:29.54,00:01:29.54,using them and not using them. You want me to make a fire?
26,00:01:33.96,00:01:33.96,">> Can do you it in the dark? >> I mean, Amanda put me through"
27,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,"the wringer. She is good, though, because she"
28,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,had me right at the brink of being willing to make it a tie
29,00:01:41.33,00:01:41.33,"vote. You know, I guess that's what"
30,00:01:44.29,00:01:44.29,she needed to see to know that she can trust me.
31,00:01:46.67,00:01:46.67,>> It was a pretty wild night. >> They took out Alexis.
32,00:02:04.08,00:02:04.08,"That's... if Parvati and Cirie are smart, they'll recognize"
33,00:02:08.83,00:02:08.83,"that Amanda is very popular with the jury, and they won't take"
34,00:02:13.54,00:02:13.54,her. >> It just doesn't make sense
35,00:02:17.12,00:02:17.12,for anyone to take her to the final three.
36,00:02:19.71,00:02:19.71,It doesn't make any sense. >> Yeah.
37,00:02:22.88,00:02:22.88,I would like to see Amanda just... outie.
38,00:02:28.25,00:02:28.25,"At tribal council, Amanda made me feel like a fool, and I"
39,00:02:31.33,00:02:31.33,definitely am pissed off about that.
40,00:02:34.12,00:02:34.12,But everything can be switched up with the hidden immunity
41,00:02:36.33,00:02:36.33,idol. I want us to find the hidden
42,00:02:38.67,00:02:38.67,immunity idol. That's the problem with Exile
43,00:02:41.00,00:02:41.00,"Island, though, because if they win, they can send anybody."
44,00:02:44.38,00:02:44.38,And I don't know if they would send me.
45,00:02:47.08,00:02:47.08,"To go to Exile Island at this point, you have to find that"
46,00:02:49.17,00:02:49.17,"idol, because it's the last chance you get to use it."
47,00:02:52.12,00:02:52.12,"So whoever gets the idol, that's pretty much like winning"
48,00:02:54.67,00:02:54.67,"individual immunity. And then if I win, like if I"
49,00:02:58.08,00:02:58.08,win... I'm going to try and win. Okay.
50,00:03:00.62,00:03:00.62,Okay. >> And if I win you want me to
51,00:03:04.12,00:03:04.12,"send you? I mean, that's in our best"
52,00:03:08.12,00:03:08.12,"interest right now. >> I think so, yes."
53,00:03:10.83,00:03:10.83,"You need to. Probably... like, I don't want"
54,00:03:13.17,00:03:13.17,"to go, because it's Exile, but we have to at this point."
55,00:03:17.29,00:03:17.29,"At this point, I'm weighing the pros and cons of different"
56,00:03:20.08,00:03:20.08,choices I could make in this game.
57,00:03:22.25,00:03:22.25,I might have to listen to Natalie and go with Natalie.
58,00:03:24.00,00:03:24.00,But nothing is set in stone right now.
59,00:03:25.88,00:03:25.88,"I mean, everything is just... it's still moving, it's still"
60,00:03:27.67,00:03:27.67,kind of evolving. So at this point I don't trust
61,00:03:29.79,00:03:29.79,anybody in this game. I really can't 100% trust
62,00:03:32.17,00:03:32.17,anybody. But I do have to pick sides.

65,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,>> Don't even qualify it. He's going.
66,00:04:37.75,00:04:37.75,>> Exactly. That's what I'm thinking.
67,00:04:39.75,00:04:39.75,I don't really have a question mark about Cirie anymore.
68,00:04:42.12,00:04:42.12,I pretty much tested her trust when... she was pretty much
69,00:04:44.71,00:04:44.71,"ready to pick rocks, so I'm not too worried about Cirie's"
70,00:04:47.62,00:04:47.62,"loyalty. You know, I trust my girls"
71,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,"again. I trust Parv and Cirie, and it's"
72,00:04:52.42,00:04:52.42,us three to the end. >> It matters if he wins...
73,00:04:59.46,00:04:59.46,>> I know. We don't want Erik or Natalie
74,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,"going to Exile, because if one of them gets the hidden immunity"
75,00:05:06.58,00:05:06.58,"idol, it could be the end of the game for me, Parvati, or Cirie."
76,00:05:10.46,00:05:10.46,>> Erik is whoever gets to him first.
77,00:05:13.21,00:05:13.21,It Amanda could get in his head that she forgives him...
78,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,>> Yeah. >> ...he'll do whatever she
79,00:05:19.25,00:05:19.25,says. >> You.
80,00:05:23.54,00:05:23.54,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, talk to him."
81,00:05:26.25,00:05:26.25,"Try to get him... >> So, what are your thoughts"
82,00:05:36.25,00:05:36.25,now about things going on? >> I'm looking to whatever this
83,00:05:38.75,00:05:38.75,reward is. And... I don't know.
84,00:05:43.88,00:05:43.88,"I feel like I could win it, like I want to win it, because I am"
85,00:05:46.62,00:05:46.62,starving. I feel like it's going to be
86,00:05:49.04,00:05:49.04,"food. >> Amanda is a very, very"
87,00:05:53.54,00:05:53.54,strategic player. So I don't know if I can trust
88,00:05:56.79,00:05:56.79,her after she ripped me over the coals at the last tribal
89,00:05:59.71,00:05:59.71,council. And now she is pushing for
90,00:06:02.25,00:06:02.25,herself to go with me on the reward.
91,00:06:05.04,00:06:05.04,>> I'm not going out of this game without a fight.
92,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,>> Right. >> And I think it's better that
93,00:06:08.96,00:06:08.96,"we team up, you being the most physical player on the team and"
94,00:06:10.79,00:06:10.79,me the most strategic and battle against the odds rather than...
95,00:06:13.12,00:06:13.12,>> Than play into what they're doing.
96,00:06:15.29,00:06:15.29,>> ...possibly lose a challenge and be out.
97,00:06:17.67,00:06:17.67,>> That's how I do feel. I feel very stressed.
98,00:06:20.38,00:06:20.38,">> You think? Me, too."
99,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,">> It's true. >> Erik's very, very naive, so I"
100,00:06:27.04,00:06:27.04,think I can definitely manipulate his mind into sending
101,00:06:32.08,00:06:32.08,Parvati to Exile. >> What are your thoughts on
102,00:06:34.96,00:06:34.96,Exile today? Natalie was pushing for me to
103,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,"possibly go. Like, she wanted me to go."
104,00:06:41.12,00:06:41.12,>> Of course she wants you to. >> And I don't want to go at
105,00:06:42.92,00:06:42.92,all. >> Because she wants you to be
106,00:06:45.17,00:06:45.17,weaker for the next challenge. >> I don't want to go there at
107,00:06:47.21,00:06:47.21,all. >> You're playing a physical
108,00:06:48.88,00:06:48.88,game. Why would you weaken yourself?
109,00:06:50.67,00:06:50.67,>> That's true. >> It doesn't make any sense.
110,00:06:53.46,00:06:53.46,>> True. >> Why not send Parvati?
111,00:06:55.46,00:06:55.46,"Parvati is so weak right now, she won't even want to look for"
112,00:06:57.46,00:06:57.46,it. She'll just sit there on the
113,00:06:59.08,00:06:59.08,"island. >> It's really weird, because I"
114,00:07:01.08,00:07:01.08,feel like I have some kind of choice to make on the fact that
115,00:07:04.21,00:07:04.21,"I'm starting to win some challenges, and now I feel like"
116,00:07:06.71,00:07:06.71,it's basically Natalie and Amanda who are trying to talk me
117,00:07:09.50,00:07:09.50,into some different plan. So it's very... who do you
118,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,trust? Who do you really trust here?
119,00:07:15.79,00:07:15.79,">> You're good at thinking, Erik."
120,00:07:17.75,00:07:17.75,"Like, you're almost there sometimes."
121,00:07:19.46,00:07:19.46,">> Almost there. I mean, it's not all hair up on"
122,00:07:21.88,00:07:21.88,"my head. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys!"
123,00:07:35.67,00:07:35.67,>> Sweet. >> You guys ready to get to your
124,00:07:38.58,00:07:38.58,challenge? >> Yeah.
125,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,>> Yeah. >> JEFF: Today's challenge is
126,00:07:41.67,00:07:41.67,going to test how well you know this game you love so well.
127,00:07:45.29,00:07:45.29,"For today's challenge, I'm going to ask you questions about"
128,00:07:47.92,00:07:47.92,favorite moments from past seasons of Survivor.
129,00:07:52.92,00:07:52.92,"Every time you get one right, you score a point."
130,00:07:55.08,00:07:55.08,First to four wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
131,00:07:57.67,00:07:57.67,for? >> Yes!
132,00:07:59.33,00:07:59.33,>> JEFF: The winner of this challenge will board a
133,00:08:01.29,00:08:01.29,helicopter. You will take a beautiful flight
134,00:08:03.62,00:08:03.62,over the rock islands. You will land at a luxury
135,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,"resort. >> Oh, my god!"
136,00:08:08.33,00:08:08.33,">> JEFF: Massage, meal. >> Meal!"
137,00:08:11.33,00:08:11.33,>> JEFF: You'll return to camp in the morning.
138,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,"In addition, the winner of the challenge will send one person"
139,00:08:16.96,00:08:16.96,to Exile Island. Because Amanda played the hidden
140,00:08:19.79,00:08:19.79,"immunity idol at the last tribal council, there is yet another"
141,00:08:23.04,00:08:23.04,hidden immunity idol. The last time you can use the
142,00:08:26.96,00:08:26.96,hidden immunity idol is the next tribal council.
143,00:08:29.71,00:08:29.71,"That means you have one chance to find the idol, one time to"
144,00:08:32.96,00:08:32.96,play it. Big enough stakes?
145,00:08:35.12,00:08:35.12,">> Yeah. >> JEFF: All right, we'll get"
146,00:08:36.83,00:08:36.83,"started. All right, first question."
147,00:08:41.29,00:08:41.29,On which season of Survivor did a castaway have a pet snake?
148,00:08:52.42,00:08:52.42,Everybody locked in? Cirie makes a last-minute
149,00:08:55.21,00:08:55.21,"change, and it's a good thing she did."
150,00:08:57.38,00:08:57.38,The correct answer is Pearl Islands.
151,00:08:59.54,00:08:59.54,Cirie gets it right. Erik gets it right.
152,00:09:02.38,00:09:02.38,Rupert had a pet snake named Balboa.
153,00:09:06.04,00:09:06.04,"One point Cirie, one point Erik. Next question."
154,00:09:09.83,00:09:09.83,"In which season of Survivor did a shark bite a survivor, and in"
155,00:09:14.04,00:09:14.04,retaliation the survivor bit it back?
156,00:09:18.88,00:09:18.88,"If you are a fan of this game, you should know this."
157,00:09:23.00,00:09:23.00,Erik says it was the first season of Survivor.
158,00:09:28.50,00:09:28.50,That is not right. Parvati and Cirie says Palau.
159,00:09:31.42,00:09:31.42,Palau is wrong. Natalie and Amanda say Survivor
160,00:09:33.83,00:09:33.83,All-Stars. All-Stars is right.
161,00:09:36.96,00:09:36.96,Amanda and Natalie both score a point.
162,00:09:39.17,00:09:39.17,Richard Hatch got bitten by a shark and he bit it back.
163,00:09:42.75,00:09:42.75,">> His teeth, right there, he's got me."
164,00:09:46.88,00:09:46.88,">> JEFF: Cirie, Amanda, Natalie, and Erik all with one."
165,00:09:50.17,00:09:50.17,Playing to four. Next question:
166,00:09:52.75,00:09:52.75,In which season of Survivor did a tribemate ask another
167,00:09:56.46,00:09:56.46,tribemate to pee on their hand after being stung by a sea
168,00:10:00.42,00:10:00.42,"urchin? If you saw the season, you'll"
169,00:10:03.71,00:10:03.71,remember this moment. One person got it right.
170,00:10:09.83,00:10:09.83,The correct answer was Survivor: Marcasis.
171,00:10:13.92,00:10:13.92,"Erik, the only one to get it right."
172,00:10:16.25,00:10:16.25,John asked Kathy to pee on his hand after being stung by a sea
173,00:10:19.25,00:10:19.25,urchin. >> I need somebody who can pee
174,00:10:21.08,00:10:21.08,"on my hand. Okay, okay."
175,00:10:26.71,00:10:26.71,>> JEFF: Erik moves into the lead with two.
176,00:10:28.75,00:10:28.75,"Cirie, Amanda, Natalie with one. Parvati with zero."
177,00:10:31.71,00:10:31.71,Next question. During which season of Survivor
178,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,was one of the castaways evacuated after falling into the
179,00:10:37.92,00:10:37.92,"fire? Cirie, Parvati, and Erik all say"
180,00:10:50.67,00:10:50.67,"Survivor: Australia. Erik is nodding, certain he's"
181,00:10:53.25,00:10:53.25,right. The correct answer is Survivor:
182,00:10:55.50,00:10:55.50,Australia. Michael fell in the fire.
183,00:10:59.38,00:10:59.38,>> You're coming right now. >> JEFF: That was 2001.
184,00:11:03.62,00:11:03.62,Erik was 14 years old. Proof of your superfan status.
185,00:11:09.25,00:11:09.25,"Erik now in the lead with three, Cirie with two, Parvati, Amanda,"
186,00:11:13.04,00:11:13.04,and Natalie with one. Next question.
187,00:11:16.17,00:11:16.17,"Erik, get this one right, you win reward."
188,00:11:23.12,00:11:23.12,During which season of Survivor did we first divide
189,00:11:25.75,00:11:25.75,the castaways into four separate tribes?
190,00:11:31.25,00:11:31.25,When was the first time we divided the castaways into four
191,00:11:35.12,00:11:35.12,separate tribes? Parvati and Amanda both say the
192,00:11:45.29,00:11:45.29,Cooks. Both wrong.
193,00:11:47.75,00:11:47.75,"Cirie, Natalie, and Erik all say Exile Island."
194,00:11:51.75,00:11:51.75,"For the first time ever, you have been divided into four"
195,00:11:55.50,00:11:55.50,tribes by age and gender. Exile island is correct.
196,00:11:59.33,00:11:59.33,Erik wins reward. >> Survivor!
197,00:12:04.25,00:12:04.25,">> Spin it, baby. >> JEFF: Nice job."
198,00:12:07.62,00:12:07.62,">> Thank you. >> JEFF: Okay, first decision."
199,00:12:10.12,00:12:10.12,Who you sending to Exile Island? Big strategy at this point.
200,00:12:15.00,00:12:15.00,>> I'm pretty sure that I want to send Parvati to Exile Island.
201,00:12:19.62,00:12:19.62,">> Bye, guys. >> JEFF: Parvati, boat's waiting"
202,00:12:23.54,00:12:23.54,"for you. All right, Erik, next decision."
203,00:12:26.54,00:12:26.54,You have three people left. You're going to choose one
204,00:12:28.79,00:12:28.79,"person to go with you. >> Before the challenge, I gave"
205,00:12:31.96,00:12:31.96,Amanda my word that I would take her.
206,00:12:34.42,00:12:34.42,"And if she won, she had her word that she would take me."
207,00:12:37.38,00:12:37.38,"So I'm going to pick Amanda. >> JEFF: Come on over, Amanda."
208,00:12:44.21,00:12:44.21,>> Thank you for keeping your word.
209,00:12:48.21,00:12:48.21,">> JEFF: All right, Cirie, Natalie, grab your stuff."
210,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,Head back to camp. I got nothing for you.
211,00:12:51.88,00:12:51.88,">> Bye, guys. >> JEFF: Erik, Amanda, nice"
212,00:12:54.08,00:12:54.08,"reward-- massage, nice meal, good night's sleep."
213,00:12:57.04,00:12:57.04,>> Yes! High five.
214,00:12:59.04,00:12:59.04,>> JEFF: Helicopter's waiting for you.
215,00:13:00.58,00:13:00.58,Enjoy it. Head on out.
216,00:13:13.42,00:13:13.42,">> Well, that was a doozy. >> Mm-hmm."
217,00:13:16.75,00:13:16.75,I'm so upset. Just stunned.
218,00:13:21.17,00:13:21.17,"Like, if Erik seriously wanted to get Amanda out, it would have"
219,00:13:25.33,00:13:25.33,"been a sure-fire thing to send me to Exile, not Parvati."
220,00:13:30.12,00:13:30.12,Had a reward challenge. Erik won.
221,00:13:33.17,00:13:33.17,"I was hoping for him to win, considering the conversation we"
222,00:13:36.46,00:13:36.46,had this morning about it. He said he'd send me to Exile or
223,00:13:39.29,00:13:39.29,"take me on the reward. Well, Parvati's on Exile, and he"
224,00:13:42.17,00:13:42.17,"chooses to take Amanda on the reward, which adds up not one"
225,00:13:47.75,00:13:47.75,iota. >> Erik is a little weasel.
226,00:13:52.79,00:13:52.79,"To me, where do his loyalties lie if he told you he'd take"
227,00:13:56.12,00:13:56.12,"you, and he told her he'd take her, and he took her, but she's"
228,00:13:59.42,00:13:59.42,the one he's going to vote out? I was kind of just yanking
229,00:14:03.75,00:14:03.75,"Natalie around a little bit, which is fun for me because it's"
230,00:14:06.67,00:14:06.67,killing her. She thinks she has Erik in her
231,00:14:08.67,00:14:08.67,pocket. You do not feed and take care of
232,00:14:11.46,00:14:11.46,the person that you plan on beating in the next immunity
233,00:14:15.75,00:14:15.75,challenge to make sure that she's the one he's going to vote
234,00:14:18.12,00:14:18.12,"out. I mean, maybe that's a new"
235,00:14:21.75,00:14:21.75,tactic that I don't know about. >> Yeah.
236,00:14:25.79,00:14:25.79,">> ""Let me make you as strong as possible so I can vote you out."""
237,00:14:29.25,00:14:29.25,The only pleasure I'm getting out of today in not going on the
238,00:14:33.04,00:14:33.04,reward is seeing Natalie stress out over Erik taking Amanda and
239,00:14:38.67,00:14:38.67,"Parvati being on Exile. >> Looks like a rat, smells like"
240,00:14:42.75,00:14:42.75,a rat. >> Give it cheese.
241,00:14:45.46,00:14:45.46,>> Yeah. Is that them?
242,00:14:48.21,00:14:48.21,>> Where? >> Natalie out there?
243,00:15:03.54,00:15:03.54,">> They're waving. >> Oh, my god!"
244,00:15:05.50,00:15:05.50,">> Yeah, they were. >> Oh, look at this view!"
245,00:15:11.08,00:15:11.08,">> Oh, my god! >> This is awesome!"
246,00:15:15.33,00:15:15.33,Woo! >> Woo!
247,00:15:21.04,00:15:21.04,">> I'm really glad that you came with me, that I chose you."
248,00:15:23.67,00:15:23.67,"Honestly, I would want a friend on this trip rather than a"
249,00:15:25.96,00:15:25.96,stranger. >> I feel the same way.
250,00:15:29.62,00:15:29.62,>> I know I didn't do what Natalie wanted me to do.
251,00:15:32.58,00:15:32.58,"If I brought Natalie, there would be no relaxation, I don't"
252,00:15:34.92,00:15:34.92,"feel, and there was a part of me that legitimately wanted to"
253,00:15:38.21,00:15:38.21,spend time with Amanda and just get to know her more as a friend
254,00:15:41.04,00:15:41.04,"again. >> Oh, my god!"
255,00:15:45.92,00:15:45.92,>> I want to enjoy this as much as I can.
256,00:15:49.08,00:15:49.08,"And I feel like I'm thinking about the game way too much,"
257,00:15:52.46,00:15:52.46,"and, thinking, ""Is Amanda manipulating you, are you"
258,00:15:55.08,00:15:55.08,"manipulating Amanda, whatever?"" And I don't want to think about"
259,00:15:57.79,00:15:57.79,that at all. >> Woo-hoo!
260,00:16:04.75,00:16:04.75,>> Woo! >> Oh!
261,00:16:11.17,00:16:11.17,">> Oh, my god. >> This is the best reward ever."
262,00:16:18.46,00:16:18.46,">> Oh, yes. >> Put them in."
263,00:16:22.12,00:16:22.12,">> Oh, my god. We're getting foot treatments."
264,00:16:25.62,00:16:25.62,>> Whatever you're doing to the toes...
265,00:16:30.25,00:16:30.25,I've never been to a spa in my life.
266,00:16:32.71,00:16:32.71,>> Really? >> Never been to a spa in my
267,00:16:34.58,00:16:34.58,life. >> I feel like ever since I got
268,00:16:43.58,00:16:43.58,"immunity last time, like, I'm, like, the center of all that's"
269,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,"going on. >> Well, you kind of are."
270,00:16:51.33,00:16:51.33,">> People are coming to me to ask me, ""What decision do you"
271,00:16:54.25,00:16:54.25,"want to make?"" And I'm just like, ""I work in an"
272,00:16:57.75,00:16:57.75,ice cream parlor. I don't do this.
273,00:16:59.71,00:16:59.71,"I don't make these decisions about people."""
274,00:17:01.71,00:17:01.71,>> Why not? >> I just...
275,00:17:04.25,00:17:04.25,>> It's good to be in a power position.
276,00:17:05.92,00:17:05.92,>> I'm just not used to it. I'm going to kick myself
277,00:17:08.29,00:17:08.29,"probably for whatever choices that I made today, but I'm"
278,00:17:11.12,00:17:11.12,trying to go with what I have. I'm trying to go with what I can
279,00:17:14.00,00:17:14.00,see right now and make the best decision.
280,00:17:16.54,00:17:16.54,"I just need to step up, I think. I mean, that's part of being a"
281,00:17:19.71,00:17:19.71,"man, being an ice cream man instead of an ice cream boy."
282,00:17:37.92,00:17:37.92,">> I got here to Exile, and it's gorgeous."
283,00:17:40.83,00:17:40.83,It's paradise for me. This is kind of like my own
284,00:17:43.00,00:17:43.00,"little private vacation. I love it, because I really"
285,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17,"needed this time to just chill, maybe get a little tan, maybe"
286,00:17:49.04,00:17:49.04,"look for the idol if I want to. If I don't want to, I don't have"
287,00:17:51.92,00:17:51.92,"to, because the reason for me being here is just to prevent"
288,00:17:56.04,00:17:56.04,Natalie and Erik from getting a chance at getting the idol.
289,00:17:59.21,00:17:59.21,"So it doesn't really matter if I find the idol or not, because"
290,00:18:01.54,00:18:01.54,"Cirie, Amanda, and me, we have the numbers."
291,00:18:16.46,00:18:16.46,>> I hate feeling bitter when people come back from rewards.
292,00:18:20.12,00:18:20.12,But you just can't help it. >> I'm not bitter about that.
293,00:18:22.08,00:18:22.08,"I'm bitter about... well, we promised each other if we won"
294,00:18:25.21,00:18:25.21,we'd take each other. What?
295,00:18:27.54,00:18:27.54,>> Where is everybody? >> I don't know.
296,00:18:32.33,00:18:32.33,">> Probably sleeping. >> Oh, yeah."
297,00:18:35.04,00:18:35.04,I think that's them. >> Yeah.
298,00:18:40.04,00:18:40.04,>> Look who's back. Bitches.
299,00:18:43.17,00:18:43.17,Don't try to look pitiful. I know it was absolutely
300,00:18:46.17,00:18:46.17,wonderful. I won that same challenge in my
301,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,season. So I don't want to hear that it
302,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,wasn't fun and y'all didn't wake up at 3:00 AM and eat more food.
303,00:18:54.71,00:18:54.71,>> We actually didn't eat more food.
304,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,>> You should have. That's what we did.
305,00:18:59.25,00:18:59.25,">> They had just dinner. Like, you pick from the list."
306,00:19:03.17,00:19:03.17,">> We had, like, a waitress. >> I wish we all could have"
307,00:19:05.04,00:19:05.04,gone. >> Returning to camp was very
308,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,"bad. I come back to camp, and Natalie"
309,00:19:18.38,00:19:18.38,didn't even look at me. She doesn't even talk to me.
310,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,It's no longer sunshine and happiness.
311,00:19:23.21,00:19:23.21,"I mean, she obviously had resentment."
312,00:19:37.21,00:19:37.21,I know Nat is pissed off at me for a lot of reasons.
313,00:19:40.58,00:19:40.58,>> Yeah. I guess she thinks you should
314,00:19:42.54,00:19:42.54,"have taken her, but she did... see, I don't know."
315,00:19:44.17,00:19:44.17,Because she did say she wanted to go to Exile.
316,00:19:46.21,00:19:46.21,>> Mm-hmm. >> And I guess she feels like if
317,00:19:49.04,00:19:49.04,"you were going to vote Amanda out, how would you take her on a"
318,00:19:51.96,00:19:51.96,reward? >> I feel regardless of what
319,00:19:54.75,00:19:54.75,"happens right now, I'm going to piss somebody off."
320,00:19:57.21,00:19:57.21,">> See, that's the thing. >> I'm either going to piss off"
321,00:20:00.25,00:20:00.25,Nat or piss off Amanda right now for sure.
322,00:20:02.25,00:20:02.25,>> Do you think if Natalie was sitting next to you she would
323,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,"beat you hands down, or you think if Amanda was sitting next"
324,00:20:05.54,00:20:05.54,to you she'd beat you hands down?
325,00:20:07.04,00:20:07.04,>> That's what I have to think about.
326,00:20:08.75,00:20:08.75,">> That's the question. >> I feel like me, you, and"
327,00:20:10.62,00:20:10.62,"Parvati are still on the fence, because we don't know which one"
328,00:20:12.71,00:20:12.71,is most likely to win all the votes.
329,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,We think that both of them have a really good chance.
330,00:20:18.00,00:20:18.00,"So maybe me, you, and Parv should go to the end and do that"
331,00:20:19.71,00:20:19.71,instead. >> That would mean we would get
332,00:20:22.12,00:20:22.12,rid of who? >> Either Nat or Amanda.
333,00:20:27.08,00:20:27.08,">> God, this idiot. I literally walked right in"
334,00:20:31.21,00:20:31.21,front of Erik and heard his entire conversation with Cirie
335,00:20:34.58,00:20:34.58,about how Natalie and Amanda are the biggest jury vote threats.
336,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,Everybody's going to vote for them on the jury so they can't
337,00:20:41.67,00:20:41.67,go to the final three. You know what?
338,00:20:44.38,00:20:44.38,"I could have literally bitch- slapped him, smack him like his"
339,00:20:46.88,00:20:46.88,mother. >> What just happened just now?
340,00:20:59.62,00:20:59.62,>> I just overheard a complete conversation.
341,00:21:01.50,00:21:01.50,">> He just told me that it would probably be beneficial for me,"
342,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,"him, and Parv to go to the end. >> I'm not surprised."
343,00:21:09.25,00:21:09.25,"Am I surprised? No, I know this is him."
344,00:21:14.88,00:21:14.88,"See, the problem with Erik's strategy is that there's five"
345,00:21:21.04,00:21:21.04,"people left, and four of them are women."
346,00:21:25.12,00:21:25.12,And when you go to each woman and you tell her something
347,00:21:28.17,00:21:28.17,"different, pretty soon the women are going to talk."
348,00:21:30.92,00:21:30.92,>> Idiot. >> I might have screwed up quite
349,00:21:38.25,00:21:38.25,a bit. I've been telling these girls
350,00:21:41.12,00:21:41.12,"all these different things, and I walked up on all three of them"
351,00:21:44.12,00:21:44.12,"talking to each other, and I'm worried."
352,00:21:46.71,00:21:46.71,I'm definitely worried. I feel like all of the women
353,00:21:56.33,00:21:56.33,here think I'm full of crap. >> Don't you know everyone is
354,00:21:58.75,00:21:58.75,"going to talk? >> Yeah, I know."
355,00:22:07.58,00:22:07.58,">> Well, you need to pick one side or the other."
356,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,You can't keep flipping. You don't want to be with me
357,00:22:12.04,00:22:12.04,because you think I'm a threat. And then you want to vote me
358,00:22:14.08,00:22:14.08,"out. And then all of a sudden, we're,"
359,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,"like, best friends. And then I hear from everyone"
360,00:22:19.12,00:22:19.12,else that you still are planning on voting me out.
361,00:22:22.21,00:22:22.21,>> I make so many mistakes. I know the girls don't trust me
362,00:22:25.79,00:22:25.79,at all. And I'm scared I'm the next to
363,00:22:28.67,00:22:28.67,go. I can't stress how important it
364,00:22:31.38,00:22:31.38,is that I win the next immunity. Right now it's just like the
365,00:22:34.04,00:22:34.04,animal kingdom. It's either you win and survive
366,00:22:36.21,00:22:36.21,"or you fail and you die. >> JEFF: Come on in, guys!"
367,00:22:53.04,00:22:53.04,"I'll now bring in Parvati, returning from Exile Island."
368,00:22:57.12,00:22:57.12,">> Hey, Parv. >> JEFF: You guys ready to get"
369,00:23:01.08,00:23:01.08,"to today's challenge? Erik, I'll take back the"
370,00:23:03.83,00:23:03.83,necklace once again. >> Here you go.
371,00:23:07.75,00:23:07.75,">> It's good to see you. >> Hi, baby!"
372,00:23:09.08,00:23:09.08,">> Hi! >> Hey, girl."
373,00:23:11.67,00:23:11.67,">> JEFF: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
374,00:23:14.46,00:23:14.46,"For today's challenge, you will work to solve three puzzles."
375,00:23:17.21,00:23:17.21,"Using a set of coordinates, you will cross two ropes."

442,00:28:33.46,00:28:33.46,probably. >> Yeah.

444,00:28:39.54,00:28:39.54,He told us all three same thing. >> Wow.
445,00:28:44.50,00:28:44.50,>> Busted. >> He got busted?
446,00:28:47.25,00:28:47.25,>> Mm-hmm. >> That sucks that he won!
447,00:28:50.58,00:28:50.58,"God. If he didn't have that necklace,"
448,00:28:53.67,00:28:53.67,"he'd be gone. Probably not, huh?"
449,00:29:04.25,00:29:04.25,>> What? >> If he would give you his
450,00:29:06.12,00:29:06.12,necklace. Do you think you could talk
451,00:29:08.04,00:29:08.04,him into giving you the necklace?
452,00:29:10.79,00:29:10.79,">> Nat, work your magic. You can convince him to give it"
453,00:29:14.50,00:29:14.50,to you. >> Why would it benefit him
454,00:29:16.33,00:29:16.33,"giving me the necklace? >> Say, ""I'll convince the"
455,00:29:18.62,00:29:18.62,"jury..."" you know, ""They'll know everything you've done."
456,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,They're not going to vote for you anyways.

459,00:29:28.29,00:29:28.29,"Just go off. >> Nat, tell him if he were to"
460,00:29:30.92,00:29:30.92,"give you the necklace, that would redeem him, and we would"
461,00:29:34.54,00:29:34.54,vote for Amanda. >> Who would fall for that?
462,00:29:37.71,00:29:37.71,"Like, I feel stupid listening to you right now."
463,00:29:40.29,00:29:40.29,">> Ozzy, Jason, and Erik. He belongs in that threesome."
464,00:29:44.17,00:29:44.17,"He belongs in that trio. >> You're good at this, Nat."
465,00:29:48.29,00:29:48.29,">> Yeah, but, I mean, this is just ridiculous."
466,00:29:52.29,00:29:52.29,"I mean, I'll try it, but... I'll say I talked to Cirie about it,"
467,00:29:55.54,00:29:55.54,she's down with voting Amanda. >> But the only way I'll go
468,00:29:58.04,00:29:58.04,"along is if he saves you. >> Right, right, right, right."
469,00:30:00.92,00:30:00.92,>> Because I don't believe him. I have to see him save you to
470,00:30:03.42,00:30:03.42,"believe that he'll vote Amanda, because of all the stuff he's"
471,00:30:05.88,00:30:05.88,been saying. Perfect.
472,00:30:07.92,00:30:07.92,>> I think it could work. >> It depends on how good you
473,00:30:11.46,00:30:11.46,"are with this right here. >> Honestly, I'm on my way home"
474,00:30:20.92,00:30:20.92,packing tonight. But I had the most harebrained
475,00:30:22.83,00:30:22.83,idea. >> Okay.
476,00:30:24.67,00:30:24.67,">> I'll run it by you, you make your decision."
477,00:30:28.38,00:30:28.38,>> Harebrained. I can relate.
478,00:30:30.08,00:30:30.08,>> It's crazy. >> Okay.
479,00:30:31.96,00:30:31.96,>> But it's brilliant. Myself or Amanda are your
480,00:30:36.50,00:30:36.50,"biggest threats, right? That's who you want..."
481,00:30:38.29,00:30:38.29,>> That's how I feel. >> Okay.
482,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,">> Yeah. >> Well, what if me, you, and"
483,00:30:44.75,00:30:44.75,Cirie vote Amanda tonight? >> Okay.
484,00:30:50.42,00:30:50.42,>> This is where it gets funny and tricky.
485,00:30:53.00,00:30:53.00,You give me your necklace. >> I'm not even going to
486,00:30:55.17,00:30:55.17,consider that. >> Just hear me out.
487,00:30:57.25,00:30:57.25,"If you give me your necklace tonight, Cirie said she would"
488,00:30:59.62,00:30:59.62,hands down vote for Amanda. That's all we need.
489,00:31:02.04,00:31:02.04,>> What's wrong with voting for Amanda without me giving up the
490,00:31:06.08,00:31:06.08,necklace? Everybody thinks I'm an idiot
491,00:31:09.00,00:31:09.00,right now. >> I'm just thinking jury votes
492,00:31:11.79,00:31:11.79,for you. Because you're riding this thing
493,00:31:13.29,00:31:13.29,"all the way to the end. >> When I get there, I'm not"
494,00:31:14.96,00:31:14.96,going to have anybody. >> Right.
495,00:31:16.62,00:31:16.62,We were thinking you redeem yourself with the jury.
496,00:31:19.71,00:31:19.71,"I just think it would be a huge, pivotal move for you."
497,00:31:23.00,00:31:23.00,Because you're going to need a pivotal move if you want a jury
498,00:31:24.54,00:31:24.54,vote. >> Mm-hmm.
499,00:31:26.46,00:31:26.46,I have felt like I don't have a lot of jury votes.
500,00:31:30.08,00:31:30.08,">> Yeah. >> All right, let me talk to"
501,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,"Cirie. >> At this point, Amanda is a"
502,00:31:38.58,00:31:38.58,threat. There's no question.
503,00:31:40.46,00:31:40.46,What is the problem with me keeping immunity and still
504,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,voting Amanda? >> Because I don't... I don't
505,00:31:45.54,00:31:45.54,know if I would believe that you would vote Amanda.
506,00:31:47.92,00:31:47.92,">> Right. >> I wish I could, like, trust"
507,00:31:50.04,00:31:50.04,"you in the fact of just you saying it, but you kind of..."
508,00:31:55.12,00:31:55.12,>> Blew that up. >> ...took that all away.
509,00:31:57.88,00:31:57.88,>> My word isn't good anymore. >> No.
510,00:32:00.00,00:32:00.00,>> And I'm all sketchy. >> Exactly.
511,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,>> I'm like this. >> So what do I do?
512,00:32:04.00,00:32:04.00,Do I... that's why it has to be that way.
513,00:32:05.71,00:32:05.71,"I mean, I know it's hard to ask somebody to give up immunity,"
514,00:32:09.17,00:32:09.17,"but for me, if you were to save Nat, then I would believe you,"
515,00:32:13.62,00:32:13.62,and that would cue me that we're all going to vote Amanda.
516,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67,"We've thrown the line out to Erik, and I think he's nibbling"
517,00:32:21.67,00:32:21.67,around the edges. >> I have to think about it.
518,00:32:24.50,00:32:24.50,">> Yeah, of course, I'm sure. If Erik takes that necklace off,"
519,00:32:29.54,00:32:29.54,"his torch would be snuffed so quick, I don't even think he"
520,00:32:33.25,00:32:33.25,could have time to blink his eyes.
521,00:32:36.25,00:32:36.25,"Oh, I just don't know, you know? Erik is a pretty smart guy."
522,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,So it's like a 50-50 shot. Him being blasted at tribal
523,00:32:44.42,00:32:44.42,could push him over the edge. Even if he doesn't make up his
524,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,"mind before we go, at tribal, you and Parvati blast him, and"
525,00:32:50.83,00:32:50.83,"me and Natalie won't so he can be thinking, like, ""Maybe this"
526,00:32:54.46,00:32:54.46,"will be a good move."" >> Okay."
527,00:32:56.08,00:32:56.08,>> That's all I want to say. I don't want him to see me
528,00:32:57.71,00:32:57.71,"talking to you. >> I'm scared about immunity,"
529,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,the hidden immunity. Because I feel like Parvati
530,00:33:05.54,00:33:05.54,"found it, and she has it, and she's going to give it to"
531,00:33:07.96,00:33:07.96,Amanda. What is the possibility that you
532,00:33:10.58,00:33:10.58,guys will vote Parv with me instead of Amanda?
533,00:33:14.08,00:33:14.08,">> Well, if it makes more sense and you feel more comfortable"
534,00:33:19.79,00:33:19.79,going a different route. >> Right.
535,00:33:22.17,00:33:22.17,"Like, I feel like all the girls like, ""Let's get Erik."""
536,00:33:24.21,00:33:24.21,>> I get your concern. I get you having to angle out
537,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,every possible angle. I get it.
538,00:33:32.83,00:33:32.83,>> I'm still scared... I'm just being honest.
539,00:33:34.62,00:33:34.62,"That's my fear. >> No, I get it, but just go out"
540,00:33:37.21,00:33:37.21,on a limb. Go out on a limb.
541,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,>> I don't know. >> He's worried about the hidden
542,00:33:53.08,00:33:53.08,"immunity, and he would feel much better if the three of us voted"
543,00:33:55.58,00:33:55.58,for Parv. He is afraid Parv's going to
544,00:33:58.25,00:33:58.25,"pull the idol. >> All right, I'll agree with"
545,00:34:01.71,00:34:01.71,"anything right now. Girl, we've got him on a hook."
546,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,We've got him on the hook. We've just got to reel him in.
547,00:34:06.25,00:34:06.25,It would be the ultimate Jedi mind trick.
548,00:34:09.00,00:34:09.00,I just don't know-- will he buy it?
549,00:34:27.42,00:34:27.42,>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
550,00:34:30.04,00:34:30.04,"Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James, and Alexis, voted out at the last"
551,00:34:39.83,00:34:39.83,"tribal council. Erik, let's talk about the"
552,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,reward challenge. You decide to bring Amanda with
553,00:34:47.46,00:34:47.46,you after she had completely worked you at the last tribal
554,00:34:51.92,00:34:51.92,"council. >> Well, I felt like I needed to"
555,00:34:54.42,00:34:54.42,"redeem myself, and I felt like that she could see it as some"
556,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,kind of nice gesture to kind of bury the hatchet.
557,00:34:59.62,00:34:59.62,">> JEFF: So, Parvati, tell me about your time on Exile."
558,00:35:04.50,00:35:04.50,">> It ended up being, like, a little nice mini-vacation for"
559,00:35:08.08,00:35:08.08,"me. But when I got back from Exile,"
560,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,I heard about Erik running around and making alliances with
561,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,"every single person, and then breaking their alliances, and"
562,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,"then switching back up, and switching back over, when he"
563,00:35:20.42,00:35:20.42,didn't even need to do that. He'd won immunity for the past
564,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,"three times in a row. So I was happy to be on Exile,"
565,00:35:26.12,00:35:26.12,"actually, to be away from that. >> JEFF: Erik, what's it feel"
566,00:35:30.04,00:35:30.04,"like to hear Parvati out you, saying you made alliances with"
567,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,"everybody here, you lied to everybody here, and all the"
568,00:35:36.33,00:35:36.33,"women are nodding their head going, ""Yep, yep, yep, yep""?"
569,00:35:39.25,00:35:39.25,">> I was nodding my head with them, because everyone"
570,00:35:41.71,00:35:41.71,"basically turned around and went to each other and said, ""Hey,"
571,00:35:44.00,00:35:44.00,Erik's full of crap. Erik's telling everybody what
572,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,"they want to hear."" It was stupid."
573,00:35:48.42,00:35:48.42,It was just a mistake. And I feel like I need to come
574,00:35:50.38,00:35:50.38,"to this tribal tonight and ask for some kind of forgiveness,"
575,00:35:52.92,00:35:52.92,"some kind of ""I'm sorry."" >> The thing, is Erik your word"
576,00:35:55.46,00:35:55.46,means nothing to anybody anymore at all.
577,00:35:57.75,00:35:57.75,">> Exactly. >> You say you're sorry, and,"
578,00:35:59.50,00:35:59.50,"like, take me on a reward, and that's great and all, but you"
579,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,only took me to get my vote on the jury.
580,00:36:05.83,00:36:05.83,"And not only that, but everything that you were telling"
581,00:36:07.79,00:36:07.79,"me on the reward you've told her, you've told her, you've"
582,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,"told her. >> Well, that's what I'm coming"
583,00:36:12.62,00:36:12.62,forward about right now. That's what I'm trying to say
584,00:36:14.96,00:36:14.96,right now. >> But it's too late!
585,00:36:16.75,00:36:16.75,"Don't you see? >> I mean, you've just lost a"
586,00:36:18.54,00:36:18.54,lot of respect among the women here you're sitting with.
587,00:36:21.17,00:36:21.17,>> I know this. It's not like I can't... and I'm
588,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,not going to deny it right now. I'm not going to pretend I did
589,00:36:25.04,00:36:25.04,not say the things that I said. >> Because you can't!
590,00:36:27.04,00:36:27.04,">> Because I can't, exactly. I mean, game aside, I'm hoping"
591,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33,"there's some sense of forgiveness, some sense of,"
592,00:36:32.62,00:36:32.62,"""We'll try and trust you again."" >> You can't say, ""Game aside,"""
593,00:36:34.58,00:36:34.58,because we're playing this game. >> That's true.
594,00:36:36.58,00:36:36.58,">> We're in this game right now. You can't say, ""Game aside, I"
595,00:36:38.29,00:36:38.29,"apologize."" This is the game."
596,00:36:40.88,00:36:40.88,>> I'm sorry. I am sorry.
597,00:36:43.29,00:36:43.29,"I just want to tell you that, if it means anything at all."
598,00:36:50.67,00:36:50.67,">> JEFF: Erik, what's it going to take for you to actually win"
599,00:36:52.88,00:36:52.88,this game? >> That's been a question that's
600,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,"concerned me. I mean, I'm looking down the"
601,00:36:57.25,00:36:57.25,"road here to the final, and I don't see any friendly faces."
602,00:37:00.04,00:37:00.04,"I don't see anybody on the jury that's going to say, ""Hey, you"
603,00:37:02.88,00:37:02.88,"did a pretty good job."" Or, ""You didn't backstab me,"""
604,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,"or, ""You didn't lie to my face."" And especially after what I did"
605,00:37:07.92,00:37:07.92,"to piss everybody off here. I mean, I need some kind of"
606,00:37:11.75,00:37:11.75,redemption before I can have a chance of considering myself in
607,00:37:15.96,00:37:15.96,"the finals. >> JEFF: Cirie, is it realistic"
608,00:37:18.71,00:37:18.71,"to say, ""I'm sorry?"" Does it matter if you redeem"
609,00:37:21.12,00:37:21.12,"yourself? >> I think it does matter, Jeff,"
610,00:37:25.00,00:37:25.00,"because, ultimately, it lies in the hands of the people who are"
611,00:37:29.08,00:37:29.08,voted out this late and become jury members.
612,00:37:31.88,00:37:31.88,"So I think you are able to redeem yourself, and I think"
613,00:37:35.46,00:37:35.46,"it's really important that you do, especially if you've been"
614,00:37:38.29,00:37:38.29,"discredited. If you've been discredited, the"
615,00:37:41.04,00:37:41.04,words you say means absolutely nothing.
616,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,It's your actions that will show and prove what's really going
617,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,"on. >> JEFF: All right, let's get to"
618,00:37:50.21,00:37:50.21,"the vote. Erik, you have the individual"
619,00:37:52.71,00:37:52.71,"immunity necklace. As always, you can give it up to"
620,00:37:54.92,00:37:54.92,"somebody if you choose to. Otherwise, it is yours, and you"
621,00:37:57.29,00:37:57.29,are safe tonight. >> This is a very tough decision
622,00:38:02.71,00:38:02.71,"for me, for a lot of reasons. As a competitor, I always say,"
623,00:38:06.25,00:38:06.25,"""You know what? Keep your fate in our own"
624,00:38:08.88,00:38:08.88,"hands."" But there is so much weighing on"
625,00:38:10.67,00:38:10.67,my mind. I've made a lot of mistakes in
626,00:38:12.12,00:38:12.12,the past couple days. And I know that actions do speak
627,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,louder than words. I want to give individual
628,00:38:15.79,00:38:15.79,"immunity to Natalie. >> JEFF: Suddenly, Natalie, you"
629,00:38:32.88,00:38:32.88,are safe. Big change right before the
630,00:38:37.00,00:38:37.00,vote. Natalie is now safe from the
631,00:38:39.75,00:38:39.75,vote. Everybody else is fair game.
632,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,"And it is time to vote. Erik, you're up."
633,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,>> I'm voting for Parvati. You've got to take some risks
634,00:39:04.17,00:39:04.17,sometime and hope people keep their word.
635,00:39:06.79,00:39:06.79,"Oh, god! >> I don't even know what to"
636,00:39:16.67,00:39:16.67,say. But thank you.
637,00:39:25.08,00:39:25.08,">> You know... >> My mother always told me,"
638,00:39:38.50,00:39:38.50,"""You may not be able to beat them with these all time, but"
639,00:39:42.29,00:39:42.29,"you can always beat them with this."""
640,00:39:45.25,00:39:45.25,Sorry. >> You're crazy!
641,00:39:53.25,00:39:53.25,You officially go down as the dumbest survivor ever in the
642,00:39:56.17,00:39:56.17,"history of Survivor, ever. >> JEFF: I'll go tally the"
643,00:40:08.29,00:40:08.29,votes. >> JEFF: If anybody has the
644,00:40:23.25,00:40:23.25,"hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be"
645,00:40:25.12,00:40:25.12,"the time to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
646,00:40:34.08,00:40:34.08,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
647,00:40:36.21,00:40:36.21,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
648,00:40:38.29,00:40:38.29,I'll read the votes. First vote.
649,00:40:43.96,00:40:43.96,Erik. Parvati.
650,00:40:52.21,00:40:52.21,"One vote Erik, one vote Parvati. Erik."
651,00:40:58.17,00:40:58.17,Two votes Erik. 13th person voted out and the
652,00:41:04.17,00:41:04.17,"sixth member of our jury, Erik. That's three."
653,00:41:07.29,00:41:07.29,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
654,00:41:10.33,00:41:10.33,>> You guys drive me crazy. >> I've lost my reign as dumbest
655,00:41:15.67,00:41:15.67,survivor ever. >> I should have known better.
656,00:41:24.62,00:41:24.62,">> JEFF: Erik, the tribe has spoken."
657,00:41:42.25,00:41:42.25,>> JEFF: I think that is what you call a life lesson.
658,00:41:45.67,00:41:45.67,Three days left in this game. Who knows what is going to
659,00:41:49.04,00:41:49.04,happen? Grab your torches.
660,00:41:52.25,00:41:52.25,Head back to camp. Good night.
