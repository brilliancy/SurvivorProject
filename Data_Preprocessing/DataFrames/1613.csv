1,00:00:02.92,00:00:02.92,Erik was the last man left inthe game.
2,00:00:05.38,00:00:05.38,And the women's alliancedesperately wanted him out.
3,00:00:08.25,00:00:08.25,>> It's us and Erik.>> We need to figure out what we
4,00:00:10.67,00:00:10.67,need to do.>> JEFF: But when he won the
5,00:00:13.21,00:00:13.21,"immunity challenge, Erik threw awrench into their plans."
6,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,>> What are we all thinking?>> I couldn't win against
7,00:00:18.62,00:00:18.62,"Amanda.>> JEFF: So Natalie, Alexis, and"
8,00:00:22.71,00:00:22.71,"Erik decided to vote out Amanda.>> ♪ Da, da, da, da. ♪"
9,00:00:26.04,00:00:26.04,">> JEFF: Cirie was still tightwith Amanda and Parvati, but"
10,00:00:28.83,00:00:28.83,"reluctant to force a tie.>> So what do I do, make it a"
11,00:00:31.17,00:00:31.17,tie?>> You know that I would.
12,00:00:40.08,00:00:40.08,">> JEFF: At tribal council,Amanda tore into Erik for"
13,00:00:43.00,00:00:43.00,turning his back on her.>> I helped you stay here
14,00:00:45.25,00:00:45.25,"through the merge, and then Iwas asking for your help, and"
15,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83,you clearly denied me of that.>> JEFF: Then Amanda pulled off
16,00:00:50.71,00:00:50.71,the biggest blindside yet byplaying the hidden immunity
17,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,idol.>> ♪ But I got it. ♪
18,00:00:56.79,00:00:56.79,>> JEFF: The rest of the tribewas stunned as Alexis was sent
19,00:00:58.92,00:00:58.92,"home.Alexis, the tribe has spoken."
20,00:01:02.04,00:01:02.04,Only five are left.Who will be voted out tonight?
21,00:01:16.42,00:01:16.42,>> I didn't have it when I toldyou guys I didn't have it.
22,00:01:21.12,00:01:21.12,"I got it afterwards.>> Whoo-ee, tribal council, boy,"
23,00:01:25.38,00:01:25.38,"is getting dangerous, from theidols floating around and people"
24,00:01:29.54,00:01:29.54,using them and not using them.You want me to make a fire?
25,00:01:33.96,00:01:33.96,">> Can do you it in the dark?>> I mean, Amanda put me through"
26,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,"the wringer.She is good, though, because she"
27,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,had me right at the brink ofbeing willing to make it a tie
28,00:01:41.33,00:01:41.33,"vote.You know, I guess that's what"
29,00:01:44.29,00:01:44.29,she needed to see to know thatshe can trust me.
30,00:01:46.67,00:01:46.67,>> It was a pretty wild night.>> They took out Alexis.
31,00:02:04.08,00:02:04.08,"That's... if Parvati and Cirieare smart, they'll recognize"
32,00:02:08.83,00:02:08.83,"that Amanda is very popular withthe jury, and they won't take"
33,00:02:13.54,00:02:13.54,her.>> It just doesn't make sense
34,00:02:17.12,00:02:17.12,for anyone to take her to thefinal three.
35,00:02:19.71,00:02:19.71,It doesn't make any sense.>> Yeah.
36,00:02:22.88,00:02:22.88,I would like to see Amandajust... outie.
37,00:02:28.25,00:02:28.25,"At tribal council, Amanda mademe feel like a fool, and I"
38,00:02:31.33,00:02:31.33,definitely am pissed off aboutthat.
39,00:02:34.12,00:02:34.12,But everything can be switchedup with the hidden immunity
40,00:02:36.33,00:02:36.33,idol.I want us to find the hidden
41,00:02:38.67,00:02:38.67,immunity idol.That's the problem with Exile
42,00:02:41.00,00:02:41.00,"Island, though, because if theywin, they can send anybody."
43,00:02:44.38,00:02:44.38,And I don't know if they wouldsend me.
44,00:02:47.08,00:02:47.08,"To go to Exile Island at thispoint, you have to find that"
45,00:02:49.17,00:02:49.17,"idol, because it's the lastchance you get to use it."
46,00:02:52.12,00:02:52.12,"So whoever gets the idol, that'spretty much like winning"
47,00:02:54.67,00:02:54.67,"individual immunity.And then if I win, like if I"
48,00:02:58.08,00:02:58.08,win... I'm going to try and win.Okay.
49,00:03:00.62,00:03:00.62,Okay.>> And if I win you want me to
50,00:03:04.12,00:03:04.12,"send you?I mean, that's in our best"
51,00:03:08.12,00:03:08.12,"interest right now.>> I think so, yes."
52,00:03:10.83,00:03:10.83,"You need to.Probably... like, I don't want"
53,00:03:13.17,00:03:13.17,"to go, because it's Exile, butwe have to at this point."
54,00:03:17.29,00:03:17.29,"At this point, I'm weighing thepros and cons of different"
55,00:03:20.08,00:03:20.08,choices I could make in thisgame.
56,00:03:22.25,00:03:22.25,I might have to listen toNatalie and go with Natalie.
57,00:03:24.00,00:03:24.00,But nothing is set in stoneright now.
58,00:03:25.88,00:03:25.88,"I mean, everything is just...it's still moving, it's still"
59,00:03:27.67,00:03:27.67,kind of evolving.So at this point I don't trust
60,00:03:29.79,00:03:29.79,anybody in this game.I really can't 100% trust
61,00:03:32.17,00:03:32.17,anybody.But I do have to pick sides.

65,00:04:37.75,00:04:37.75,>> Exactly.That's what I'm thinking.
66,00:04:39.75,00:04:39.75,I don't really have a questionmark about Cirie anymore.
67,00:04:42.12,00:04:42.12,I pretty much tested her trustwhen... she was pretty much
68,00:04:44.71,00:04:44.71,"ready to pick rocks, so I'm nottoo worried about Cirie's"
69,00:04:47.62,00:04:47.62,"loyalty.You know, I trust my girls"
70,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,"again.I trust Parv and Cirie, and it's"
71,00:04:52.42,00:04:52.42,us three to the end.>> It matters if he wins...
72,00:04:59.46,00:04:59.46,>> I know.We don't want Erik or Natalie
73,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,"going to Exile, because if oneof them gets the hidden immunity"
74,00:05:06.58,00:05:06.58,"idol, it could be the end of thegame for me, Parvati, or Cirie."
75,00:05:10.46,00:05:10.46,>> Erik is whoever gets to himfirst.
76,00:05:13.21,00:05:13.21,It Amanda could get in his headthat she forgives him...
77,00:05:17.12,00:05:17.12,>> Yeah.>> ...he'll do whatever she
78,00:05:19.25,00:05:19.25,says.>> You.
79,00:05:23.54,00:05:23.54,"Mm-hmm.Yeah, talk to him."
80,00:05:26.25,00:05:26.25,"Try to get him...>> So, what are your thoughts"
81,00:05:36.25,00:05:36.25,now about things going on?>> I'm looking to whatever this
82,00:05:38.75,00:05:38.75,reward is.And... I don't know.
83,00:05:43.88,00:05:43.88,"I feel like I could win it, likeI want to win it, because I am"
84,00:05:46.62,00:05:46.62,starving.I feel like it's going to be
85,00:05:49.04,00:05:49.04,"food.>> Amanda is a very, very"
86,00:05:53.54,00:05:53.54,strategic player.So I don't know if I can trust
87,00:05:56.79,00:05:56.79,her after she ripped me over thecoals at the last tribal
88,00:05:59.71,00:05:59.71,council.And now she is pushing for
89,00:06:02.25,00:06:02.25,herself to go with me on thereward.
90,00:06:05.04,00:06:05.04,>> I'm not going out of thisgame without a fight.
91,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,>> Right.>> And I think it's better that
92,00:06:08.96,00:06:08.96,"we team up, you being the mostphysical player on the team and"
93,00:06:10.79,00:06:10.79,me the most strategic and battleagainst the odds rather than...
94,00:06:13.12,00:06:13.12,>> Than play into what they'redoing.
95,00:06:15.29,00:06:15.29,>> ...possibly lose a challengeand be out.
96,00:06:17.67,00:06:17.67,>> That's how I do feel.I feel very stressed.
97,00:06:20.38,00:06:20.38,">> You think?Me, too."
98,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,">> It's true.>> Erik's very, very naive, so I"
99,00:06:27.04,00:06:27.04,think I can definitelymanipulate his mind into sending
100,00:06:32.08,00:06:32.08,Parvati to Exile.>> What are your thoughts on
101,00:06:34.96,00:06:34.96,Exile today?Natalie was pushing for me to
102,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,"possibly go.Like, she wanted me to go."
103,00:06:41.12,00:06:41.12,>> Of course she wants you to.>> And I don't want to go at
104,00:06:42.92,00:06:42.92,all.>> Because she wants you to be
105,00:06:45.17,00:06:45.17,weaker for the next challenge.>> I don't want to go there at
106,00:06:47.21,00:06:47.21,all.>> You're playing a physical
107,00:06:48.88,00:06:48.88,game.Why would you weaken yourself?
108,00:06:50.67,00:06:50.67,>> That's true.>> It doesn't make any sense.
109,00:06:53.46,00:06:53.46,>> True.>> Why not send Parvati?
110,00:06:55.46,00:06:55.46,"Parvati is so weak right now,she won't even want to look for"
111,00:06:57.46,00:06:57.46,it.She'll just sit there on the
112,00:06:59.08,00:06:59.08,"island.>> It's really weird, because I"
113,00:07:01.08,00:07:01.08,feel like I have some kind ofchoice to make on the fact that
114,00:07:04.21,00:07:04.21,"I'm starting to win somechallenges, and now I feel like"
115,00:07:06.71,00:07:06.71,it's basically Natalie andAmanda who are trying to talk me
116,00:07:09.50,00:07:09.50,into some different plan.So it's very... who do you
117,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,trust?Who do you really trust here?
118,00:07:15.79,00:07:15.79,">> You're good at thinking,Erik."
119,00:07:17.75,00:07:17.75,"Like, you're almost theresometimes."

142,00:08:29.71,00:08:29.71,"That means you have one chanceto find the idol, one time to"
143,00:08:32.96,00:08:32.96,play it.Big enough stakes?

192,00:11:47.75,00:11:47.75,"Cirie, Natalie, and Erik allsay Exile Island."
193,00:11:51.75,00:11:51.75,"For the first time ever, youhave been divided into four"
194,00:11:55.50,00:11:55.50,tribes by age and gender.Exile island is correct.
195,00:11:59.33,00:11:59.33,Erik wins reward.>> Survivor!
196,00:12:04.25,00:12:04.25,">> Spin it, baby.>> JEFF: Nice job."
197,00:12:07.62,00:12:07.62,">> Thank you.>> JEFF: Okay, first decision."
198,00:12:10.12,00:12:10.12,Who you sending to Exile Island?Big strategy at this point.
199,00:12:15.00,00:12:15.00,>> I'm pretty sure that I wantto send Parvati to Exile Island.
200,00:12:19.62,00:12:19.62,">> Bye, guys.>> JEFF: Parvati, boat's waiting"
201,00:12:23.54,00:12:23.54,"for you.All right, Erik, next decision."
202,00:12:26.54,00:12:26.54,You have three people left.You're going to choose one
203,00:12:28.79,00:12:28.79,"person to go with you.>> Before the challenge, I gave"
204,00:12:31.96,00:12:31.96,Amanda my word that I would takeher.
205,00:12:34.42,00:12:34.42,"And if she won, she had her wordthat she would take me."
206,00:12:37.38,00:12:37.38,"So I'm going to pick Amanda.>> JEFF: Come on over, Amanda."
207,00:12:44.21,00:12:44.21,>> Thank you for keeping yourword.
208,00:12:48.21,00:12:48.21,">> JEFF: All right, Cirie,Natalie, grab your stuff."
209,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,Head back to camp.I got nothing for you.
210,00:12:51.88,00:12:51.88,">> Bye, guys.>> JEFF: Erik, Amanda, nice"
211,00:12:54.08,00:12:54.08,"reward-- massage, nice meal,good night's sleep."
212,00:12:57.04,00:12:57.04,>> Yes!High five.
213,00:12:59.04,00:12:59.04,>> JEFF: Helicopter's waitingfor you.
214,00:13:00.58,00:13:00.58,Enjoy it.Head on out.
215,00:13:13.42,00:13:13.42,">> Well, that was a doozy.>> Mm-hmm."
216,00:13:16.75,00:13:16.75,I'm so upset.Just stunned.
217,00:13:21.17,00:13:21.17,"Like, if Erik seriously wantedto get Amanda out, it would have"
218,00:13:25.33,00:13:25.33,"been a sure-fire thing to sendme to Exile, not Parvati."
219,00:13:30.12,00:13:30.12,Had a reward challenge.Erik won.
220,00:13:33.17,00:13:33.17,"I was hoping for him to win,considering the conversation we"
221,00:13:36.46,00:13:36.46,had this morning about it.He said he'd send me to Exile or
222,00:13:39.29,00:13:39.29,"take me on the reward.Well, Parvati's on Exile, and he"
223,00:13:42.17,00:13:42.17,"chooses to take Amanda on thereward, which adds up not one"
224,00:13:47.75,00:13:47.75,iota.>> Erik is a little weasel.
225,00:13:52.79,00:13:52.79,"To me, where do his loyaltieslie if he told you he'd take"
226,00:13:56.12,00:13:56.12,"you, and he told her he'd takeher, and he took her, but she's"
227,00:13:59.42,00:13:59.42,the one he's going to vote out?I was kind of just yanking
228,00:14:03.75,00:14:03.75,"Natalie around a little bit,which is fun for me because it's"
229,00:14:06.67,00:14:06.67,killing her.She thinks she has Erik in her
230,00:14:08.67,00:14:08.67,pocket.You do not feed and take care of
231,00:14:11.46,00:14:11.46,the person that you plan onbeating in the next immunity
232,00:14:15.75,00:14:15.75,challenge to make sure thatshe's the one he's going to vote
233,00:14:18.12,00:14:18.12,"out.I mean, maybe that's a new"
234,00:14:21.75,00:14:21.75,tactic that I don't know about.>> Yeah.
235,00:14:25.79,00:14:25.79,">> ""Let me make you as strong aspossible so I can vote you out."""
236,00:14:29.25,00:14:29.25,The only pleasure I'm gettingout of today in not going on the
237,00:14:33.04,00:14:33.04,reward is seeing Natalie stressout over Erik taking Amanda and
238,00:14:38.67,00:14:38.67,"Parvati being on Exile.>> Looks like a rat, smells like"
239,00:14:42.75,00:14:42.75,a rat.>> Give it cheese.
240,00:14:45.46,00:14:45.46,>> Yeah.Is that them?
241,00:14:48.21,00:14:48.21,>> Where?>> Natalie out there?

245,00:15:15.33,00:15:15.33,Woo!>> Woo!
246,00:15:21.04,00:15:21.04,">> I'm really glad that you camewith me, that I chose you."
247,00:15:23.67,00:15:23.67,"Honestly, I would want a friendon this trip rather than a"
248,00:15:25.96,00:15:25.96,stranger.>> I feel the same way.
249,00:15:29.62,00:15:29.62,>> I know I didn't do whatNatalie wanted me to do.
250,00:15:32.58,00:15:32.58,"If I brought Natalie, therewould be no relaxation, I don't"
251,00:15:34.92,00:15:34.92,"feel, and there was a part of methat legitimately wanted to"
252,00:15:38.21,00:15:38.21,spend time with Amanda and justget to know her more as a friend
253,00:15:41.04,00:15:41.04,"again.>> Oh, my god!"
254,00:15:45.92,00:15:45.92,>> I want to enjoy this as muchas I can.
255,00:15:49.08,00:15:49.08,"And I feel like I'm thinkingabout the game way too much,"
256,00:15:52.46,00:15:52.46,"and, thinking, ""Is Amandamanipulating you, are you"
257,00:15:55.08,00:15:55.08,"manipulating Amanda, whatever?""And I don't want to think about"
258,00:15:57.79,00:15:57.79,that at all.>> Woo-hoo!

281,00:17:37.92,00:17:37.92,">> I got here to Exile, and it'sgorgeous."
282,00:17:40.83,00:17:40.83,It's paradise for me.This is kind of like my own
283,00:17:43.00,00:17:43.00,"little private vacation.I love it, because I really"
284,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17,"needed this time to just chill,maybe get a little tan, maybe"
285,00:17:49.04,00:17:49.04,"look for the idol if I want to.If I don't want to, I don't have"
286,00:17:51.92,00:17:51.92,"to, because the reason for mebeing here is just to prevent"
287,00:17:56.04,00:17:56.04,Natalie and Erik from getting achance at getting the idol.
288,00:17:59.21,00:17:59.21,"So it doesn't really matter if Ifind the idol or not, because"
289,00:18:01.54,00:18:01.54,"Cirie, Amanda, and me, we havethe numbers."

293,00:18:25.21,00:18:25.21,we'd take each other.What?
294,00:18:27.54,00:18:27.54,>> Where is everybody?>> I don't know.
295,00:18:32.33,00:18:32.33,">> Probably sleeping.>> Oh, yeah."
296,00:18:35.04,00:18:35.04,I think that's them.>> Yeah.
297,00:18:40.04,00:18:40.04,>> Look who's back.Bitches.
298,00:18:43.17,00:18:43.17,Don't try to look pitiful.I know it was absolutely
299,00:18:46.17,00:18:46.17,wonderful.I won that same challenge in my
300,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,season.So I don't want to hear that it
301,00:18:51.04,00:18:51.04,wasn't fun and y'all didn't wakeup at 3:00 AM and eat more food.
302,00:18:54.71,00:18:54.71,>> We actually didn't eat morefood.
303,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,>> You should have.That's what we did.
304,00:18:59.25,00:18:59.25,">> They had just dinner.Like, you pick from the list."
305,00:19:03.17,00:19:03.17,">> We had, like, a waitress.>> I wish we all could have"
306,00:19:05.04,00:19:05.04,gone.>> Returning to camp was very
307,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,"bad.I come back to camp, and Natalie"
308,00:19:18.38,00:19:18.38,didn't even look at me.She doesn't even talk to me.
309,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,It's no longer sunshine andhappiness.
310,00:19:23.21,00:19:23.21,"I mean, she obviously hadresentment."
311,00:19:37.21,00:19:37.21,I know Nat is pissed off at mefor a lot of reasons.
312,00:19:40.58,00:19:40.58,>> Yeah.I guess she thinks you should
313,00:19:42.54,00:19:42.54,"have taken her, but she did...see, I don't know."
314,00:19:44.17,00:19:44.17,Because she did say she wantedto go to Exile.
315,00:19:46.21,00:19:46.21,>> Mm-hmm.>> And I guess she feels like if
316,00:19:49.04,00:19:49.04,"you were going to vote Amandaout, how would you take her on a"
317,00:19:51.96,00:19:51.96,reward?>> I feel regardless of what
318,00:19:54.75,00:19:54.75,"happens right now, I'm going topiss somebody off."
319,00:19:57.21,00:19:57.21,">> See, that's the thing.>> I'm either going to piss off"
320,00:20:00.25,00:20:00.25,Nat or piss off Amanda right nowfor sure.
321,00:20:02.25,00:20:02.25,>> Do you think if Natalie wassitting next to you she would
322,00:20:04.00,00:20:04.00,"beat you hands down, or youthink if Amanda was sitting next"
323,00:20:05.54,00:20:05.54,to you she'd beat you handsdown?
324,00:20:07.04,00:20:07.04,>> That's what I have to thinkabout.
325,00:20:08.75,00:20:08.75,">> That's the question.>> I feel like me, you, and"
326,00:20:10.62,00:20:10.62,"Parvati are still on the fence,because we don't know which one"
327,00:20:12.71,00:20:12.71,is most likely to win all thevotes.
328,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,We think that both of them havea really good chance.
329,00:20:18.00,00:20:18.00,"So maybe me, you, and Parvshould go to the end and do that"
330,00:20:19.71,00:20:19.71,instead.>> That would mean we would get
331,00:20:22.12,00:20:22.12,rid of who?>> Either Nat or Amanda.
332,00:20:27.08,00:20:27.08,">> God, this idiot.I literally walked right in"
333,00:20:31.21,00:20:31.21,front of Erik and heard hisentire conversation with Cirie
334,00:20:34.58,00:20:34.58,about how Natalie and Amanda arethe biggest jury vote threats.
335,00:20:39.33,00:20:39.33,Everybody's going to vote forthem on the jury so they can't
336,00:20:41.67,00:20:41.67,go to the final three.You know what?
337,00:20:44.38,00:20:44.38,"I could have literally bitch-slapped him, smack him like his"
338,00:20:46.88,00:20:46.88,mother.>> What just happened just now?
339,00:20:59.62,00:20:59.62,>> I just overheard a completeconversation.
340,00:21:01.50,00:21:01.50,">> He just told me that it wouldprobably be beneficial for me,"
341,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,"him, and Parv to go to the end.>> I'm not surprised."
342,00:21:09.25,00:21:09.25,"Am I surprised?No, I know this is him."
343,00:21:14.88,00:21:14.88,"See, the problem with Erik'sstrategy is that there's five"
344,00:21:21.04,00:21:21.04,"people left, and four of themare women."
345,00:21:25.12,00:21:25.12,And when you go to each womanand you tell her something
346,00:21:28.17,00:21:28.17,"different, pretty soon the womenare going to talk."
347,00:21:30.92,00:21:30.92,>> Idiot.>> I might have screwed up quite
348,00:21:38.25,00:21:38.25,a bit.I've been telling these girls
349,00:21:41.12,00:21:41.12,"all these different things, andI walked up on all three of them"
350,00:21:44.12,00:21:44.12,"talking to each other, and I'mworried."
351,00:21:46.71,00:21:46.71,I'm definitely worried.I feel like all of the women
352,00:21:56.33,00:21:56.33,here think I'm full of crap.>> Don't you know everyone is
353,00:21:58.75,00:21:58.75,"going to talk?>> Yeah, I know."
354,00:22:07.58,00:22:07.58,">> Well, you need to pick oneside or the other."
355,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,You can't keep flipping.You don't want to be with me
356,00:22:12.04,00:22:12.04,because you think I'm a threat.And then you want to vote me
357,00:22:14.08,00:22:14.08,"out.And then all of a sudden, we're,"
358,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,"like, best friends.And then I hear from everyone"
359,00:22:19.12,00:22:19.12,else that you still are planningon voting me out.
360,00:22:22.21,00:22:22.21,>> I make so many mistakes.I know the girls don't trust me
361,00:22:25.79,00:22:25.79,at all.And I'm scared I'm the next to
362,00:22:28.67,00:22:28.67,go.I can't stress how important it
363,00:22:31.38,00:22:31.38,is that I win the next immunity.Right now it's just like the
364,00:22:34.04,00:22:34.04,animal kingdom.It's either you win and survive
365,00:22:36.21,00:22:36.21,"or you fail and you die.>> JEFF: Come on in, guys!"
366,00:22:53.04,00:22:53.04,"I'll now bring in Parvati,returning from Exile Island."

496,00:31:23.00,00:31:23.00,Because you're going to need apivotal move if you want a jury
497,00:31:24.54,00:31:24.54,vote.>> Mm-hmm.
498,00:31:26.46,00:31:26.46,I have felt like I don't have alot of jury votes.
499,00:31:30.08,00:31:30.08,">> Yeah.>> All right, let me talk to"
500,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,"Cirie.>> At this point, Amanda is a"
501,00:31:38.58,00:31:38.58,threat.There's no question.
502,00:31:40.46,00:31:40.46,What is the problem with mekeeping immunity and still
503,00:31:43.21,00:31:43.21,voting Amanda?>> Because I don't... I don't
504,00:31:45.54,00:31:45.54,know if I would believe that youwould vote Amanda.
505,00:31:47.92,00:31:47.92,">> Right.>> I wish I could, like, trust"
506,00:31:50.04,00:31:50.04,"you in the fact of just yousaying it, but you kind of..."
507,00:31:55.12,00:31:55.12,>> Blew that up.>> ...took that all away.
508,00:31:57.88,00:31:57.88,>> My word isn't good anymore.>> No.
509,00:32:00.00,00:32:00.00,>> And I'm all sketchy.>> Exactly.
510,00:32:02.08,00:32:02.08,>> I'm like this.>> So what do I do?
511,00:32:04.00,00:32:04.00,Do I... that's why it has to bethat way.
512,00:32:05.71,00:32:05.71,"I mean, I know it's hard to asksomebody to give up immunity,"
513,00:32:09.17,00:32:09.17,"but for me, if you were to saveNat, then I would believe you,"
514,00:32:13.62,00:32:13.62,and that would cue me that we'reall going to vote Amanda.
515,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67,"We've thrown the line out toErik, and I think he's nibbling"
516,00:32:21.67,00:32:21.67,around the edges.>> I have to think about it.
517,00:32:24.50,00:32:24.50,">> Yeah, of course, I'm sure.If Erik takes that necklace off,"
518,00:32:29.54,00:32:29.54,"his torch would be snuffed soquick, I don't even think he"
519,00:32:33.25,00:32:33.25,could have time to blink hiseyes.
520,00:32:36.25,00:32:36.25,"Oh, I just don't know, you know?Erik is a pretty smart guy."
521,00:32:40.17,00:32:40.17,So it's like a 50-50 shot.Him being blasted at tribal
522,00:32:44.42,00:32:44.42,could push him over the edge.Even if he doesn't make up his
523,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,"mind before we go, at tribal,you and Parvati blast him, and"
524,00:32:50.83,00:32:50.83,"me and Natalie won't so he canbe thinking, like, ""Maybe this"
525,00:32:54.46,00:32:54.46,"will be a good move."">> Okay."
526,00:32:56.08,00:32:56.08,>> That's all I want to say.I don't want him to see me
527,00:32:57.71,00:32:57.71,"talking to you.>> I'm scared about immunity,"
528,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,the hidden immunity.Because I feel like Parvati
529,00:33:05.54,00:33:05.54,"found it, and she has it, andshe's going to give it to"
530,00:33:07.96,00:33:07.96,Amanda.What is the possibility that you
531,00:33:10.58,00:33:10.58,guys will vote Parv with meinstead of Amanda?
532,00:33:14.08,00:33:14.08,">> Well, if it makes more senseand you feel more comfortable"
533,00:33:19.79,00:33:19.79,going a different route.>> Right.
534,00:33:22.17,00:33:22.17,"Like, I feel like all the girlslike, ""Let's get Erik."""
535,00:33:24.21,00:33:24.21,>> I get your concern.I get you having to angle out
536,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,every possible angle.I get it.
537,00:33:32.83,00:33:32.83,>> I'm still scared... I'm justbeing honest.
538,00:33:34.62,00:33:34.62,"That's my fear.>> No, I get it, but just go out"
539,00:33:37.21,00:33:37.21,on a limb.Go out on a limb.
540,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,>> I don't know.>> He's worried about the hidden
541,00:33:53.08,00:33:53.08,"immunity, and he would feel muchbetter if the three of us voted"
542,00:33:55.58,00:33:55.58,for Parv.He is afraid Parv's going to
543,00:33:58.25,00:33:58.25,"pull the idol.>> All right, I'll agree with"
544,00:34:01.71,00:34:01.71,"anything right now.Girl, we've got him on a hook."
545,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,We've got him on the hook.We've just got to reel him in.
546,00:34:06.25,00:34:06.25,It would be the ultimate Jedimind trick.
547,00:34:09.00,00:34:09.00,I just don't know-- will he buyit?
548,00:34:27.42,00:34:27.42,>> JEFF: We'll now bring in themembers of our jury.

555,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,kind of nice gesture to kind ofbury the hatchet.
556,00:34:59.62,00:34:59.62,">> JEFF: So, Parvati, tell meabout your time on Exile."
