1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF: Previously on Survivor:
2,00:00:03.20,00:00:03.20,Kucha and Ogakor merged into one tribe at equal numbers with five
3,00:00:06.80,00:00:06.80,"members each, calling themselves Barramundi."
4,00:00:09.17,00:00:09.17,The tribe set up camp on a new beach and started from scratch.
5,00:00:12.97,00:00:12.97,"( cheering ) In a test of endurance, the"
6,00:00:16.20,00:00:16.20,first individual immunity challenge lasted over ten hours.
7,00:00:19.93,00:00:19.93,"Tina stepped down to give the more vulnerable Keith immunity,"
8,00:00:23.57,00:00:23.57,so that the ex-Ogakor tribe could take the advantage at
9,00:00:25.90,00:00:25.90,"Tribal Council. So, we're ruling this a deadlock"
10,00:00:28.43,00:00:28.43,vote. Colby and Jeff were deadlocked
11,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,"into tie, so Jeff's votes at previously Tribal Councils"
12,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,"tipped the scales, and Jeff was voted out of the tribe."
13,00:00:38.27,00:00:38.27,Nine survivors remain. Who will be voted out tonight?
14,00:01:55.57,00:01:55.57,">> RODGER: It's a late-sleeping bunch, isn't it?"
15,00:01:56.90,00:01:56.90,>> ALICIA: Yeah. >> RODGER: A lot different
16,00:01:59.10,00:01:59.10,than... than us. >> ALICIA: I know.
17,00:02:01.10,00:02:01.10,>> RODGER: Mike would've been up three hours ago.
18,00:02:02.83,00:02:02.83,">> ALICIA: I know. >> RODGER: Every time I do that,"
19,00:02:05.90,00:02:05.90,I think about old Mike. >> ALICIA: No kidding.
20,00:02:07.67,00:02:07.67,">> RODGER: And, you know, every time from now on, when we're..."
21,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,"when we're around the fire, we will think of it."
22,00:02:11.17,00:02:11.17,>> ALICIA: Yep. >> RODGER: After the last Tribal
23,00:02:23.17,00:02:23.17,"Council, I just felt like we had been outwitted by Ogakor."
24,00:02:27.23,00:02:27.23,Kucha's tribe could be picked off very easily.
25,00:02:31.13,00:02:31.13,They're in a good position to do that.
26,00:02:33.20,00:02:33.20,"We could be an extinct tribe, no longer on the face of the earth."
27,00:02:38.17,00:02:38.17,"To me, it's, uh, one-on-one and every man for himself from here"
28,00:02:40.77,00:02:40.77,"on out. See, I can catch 'em."
29,00:02:53.40,00:02:53.40,I am in it to win just like anybody else.
30,00:02:56.33,00:02:56.33,I'm going to give it my best shot.
31,00:02:58.03,00:02:58.03,My game plan right now to try to assure my survival is try to
32,00:03:02.47,00:03:02.47,"keep catching fish. Ooh, yes."
33,00:03:06.60,00:03:06.60,"If they're going to vote somebody off, it's going to"
34,00:03:08.87,00:03:08.87,probably not be the person that is supplying 'em with the food.
35,00:03:14.63,00:03:14.63,I think that is my greatest asset at this time.
36,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,"I love this fishing hole. Whoo! >> NICK: Wow, look at that"
37,00:03:36.87,00:03:36.87,crocodile. Do not want to go in that water
38,00:03:41.53,00:03:41.53,again. >> ALICIA: This game has
39,00:03:46.07,00:03:46.07,definitely changed. There's no doubt about it.
40,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,It's a whole new game. New people. New set of rules.
41,00:03:54.33,00:03:54.33,">> NICK: You keep on catching fish, you'll definitely be the"
42,00:03:56.27,00:03:56.27,last of Kutcha to go. ( laughing )
43,00:03:58.93,00:03:58.93,>> ALICIA: Ogakor knows they're in a good position now to be the
44,00:04:00.93,00:04:00.93,"last five, but they also have to know that four members on this"
45,00:04:05.33,00:04:05.33,"jury now are going to be Kucha members, and these people decide"
46,00:04:11.30,00:04:11.30,who's going to be the winner. They better start stepping up
47,00:04:15.00,00:04:15.00,and being real nice to us. >> KEITH: I feel like I'm on a
48,00:04:34.07,00:04:34.07,fishing trip with you. It's like I'm with... you're my
49,00:04:36.60,00:04:36.60,older brother and taking me fishing.
50,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13,">> RODGER: Everybody is-is real nice to everybody else, but then"
51,00:04:42.70,00:04:42.70,"you can still see groups getting off and talking, and you know"
52,00:04:46.23,00:04:46.23,what they're talking about. You know the million dollars for
53,00:04:49.27,00:04:49.27,being the final survivor is on everybody's mind.
54,00:04:51.90,00:04:51.90,>> AMBER: We're exactly where we want to be.
55,00:04:54.13,00:04:54.13,">> COLBY: As a team, Ogakor, we outplayed 'em."
56,00:04:56.67,00:04:56.67,">> AMBER: It's just, like, I feel, like, some pressure has"
57,00:04:59.07,00:04:59.07,been lifted off my shoulders. >> COLBY: I agree.
58,00:05:00.33,00:05:00.33,I... I'm sleeping so much better now after getting past the merge
59,00:05:03.37,00:05:03.37,and the final... the final vote to see who-who grabs the
60,00:05:07.80,00:05:07.80,majority. >> AMBER: I know.
61,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67,>> COLBY: And we won. >> AMBER: Geez!
62,00:05:16.70,00:05:16.70,">> KEITH: Yeah, I think Ogakor was definitely a team that"
63,00:05:19.37,00:05:19.37,stayed out of vision knowing that we needed to whittle down
64,00:05:23.47,00:05:23.47,the Kucha people. Kucha knows what we're doing.
65,00:05:27.90,00:05:27.90,"They are really good, nice people, which does make it"
66,00:05:30.47,00:05:30.47,harder as the days go on. And the closer you become to an
67,00:05:33.03,00:05:33.03,"individual, you start questioning, ""Geez, you know, I"
68,00:05:37.63,00:05:37.63,"like this person better than somebody I know on my own team."""
69,00:05:42.77,00:05:42.77,">> RODGER: Well, if I had to guess, I'd say somebody in your"
70,00:05:44.93,00:05:44.93,all's group is going to be a millionaire.
71,00:05:49.90,00:05:49.90,">> KEITH: Well, you know, help yourself out, my friend."
72,00:05:53.07,00:05:53.07,It just seems natural that certain individuals gravitate to
73,00:05:55.73,00:05:55.73,"each other, and Tina and I have made the decision that we want"
74,00:05:59.63,00:05:59.63,to be with people we like right at the very end.
75,00:06:03.67,00:06:03.67,>> ELISABETH: You know Rodger has my heart. I love him.
76,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87,>> TINA: He's a good one. >> ELISABETH: I love him.
77,00:06:09.17,00:06:09.17,"See, I knew you guys would hit it off, too."
78,00:06:10.33,00:06:10.33,>> TINA: I like him. You go into a merger thinking
79,00:06:13.73,00:06:13.73,"that you're very much aligned with a team, but then, as time"
80,00:06:18.07,00:06:18.07,"goes by, you might find out that there's people that are more"
81,00:06:21.37,00:06:21.37,"deserving, you know? I want this to be on an"
82,00:06:25.47,00:06:25.47,"individual basis, and I want the good guys to win."
83,00:06:34.77,00:06:34.77,>> JERRI: Today has been just so... weird.
84,00:06:37.40,00:06:37.40,"I feel, like, a lot of distance between myself and everybody"
85,00:06:40.87,00:06:40.87,else right now. We do have the advantage now.
86,00:06:43.40,00:06:43.40,"We're five... Kucha's... to Kucha's four, but that's not"
87,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,relaxing me at all. It's the paranoia again setting
88,00:06:49.90,00:06:49.90,in. We're in a situation where Tina
89,00:06:53.80,00:06:53.80,and Keith could team up with the Kucha people.
90,00:06:57.37,00:06:57.37,You cannot be complacent. Your back will be stabbed faster
91,00:06:59.60,00:06:59.60,than you can spit. ( clattering )
92,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,Ooh! >> TINA: Ever since the
93,00:07:22.73,00:07:22.73,"beginning, the cooking of the rice has been a problem."
94,00:07:26.07,00:07:26.07,"It was a problem at Ogakor, and the same problem came with us to"
95,00:07:29.50,00:07:29.50,"Barramundi. Basically, what it is is the"
96,00:07:34.07,00:07:34.07,rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications.
97,00:07:36.93,00:07:36.93,It has to be stirred a certain number of times.
98,00:07:38.73,00:07:38.73,"The lid has to stay on. It has to be... perfect, you"
99,00:07:43.07,00:07:43.07,"know, or... you-you catch it. >> What kind of spices we"
100,00:07:47.53,00:07:47.53,"have tonight, ladies? >> ELISABETH: A little parmesan"
101,00:07:50.53,00:07:50.53,pizza mix. >> ALICIA: The lemon pepper is
102,00:07:52.73,00:07:52.73,not great on the rice. >> AMBER: It's not?
103,00:07:54.50,00:07:54.50,>> ALICIA: No. Not great.
104,00:07:57.30,00:07:57.30,">> ELISABETH: Alicia and I were on the side of the fire, and"
105,00:07:59.70,00:07:59.70,Jerri and Amber were sitting on a log just watching every move
106,00:08:02.17,00:08:02.17,we made. Every time I would... I would
107,00:08:05.77,00:08:05.77,"take a lid off, I could see them, you know, tensing up,"
108,00:08:08.57,00:08:08.57,"like, you know, ""Why is she taking the lid off?"
109,00:08:11.53,00:08:11.53,"Why is she stirring now?"" >> AMBER: Be careful."
110,00:08:20.97,00:08:20.97,>> TINA: They're not going to go.
111,00:08:22.13,00:08:22.13,They're not going to go. >> AMBER: If you guys have a
112,00:08:24.00,00:08:24.00,"knife, a knife might be easier to stir."
113,00:08:25.20,00:08:25.20,">> ELISABETH: Well, don't even worry about it."
114,00:08:26.67,00:08:26.67,>> TINA: She actually got it. >> AMBER: You got it?
115,00:08:28.33,00:08:28.33,>> ELISABETH: Alicia and I were getting more tense trying to
116,00:08:29.47,00:08:29.47,"make it. You know, we were testing the"
117,00:08:31.20,00:08:31.20,rice. We always test to it make sure
118,00:08:33.33,00:08:33.33,"it's done, and Jerri's over on her log."
119,00:08:36.67,00:08:36.67,"""It's mushy,"" she says. >> JERRI: Mashed potatoes."
120,00:08:40.30,00:08:40.30,>> ELISABETH: I know you don't like mushy... but it's mushy.
121,00:08:44.03,00:08:44.03,>> ALICIA: I'll stir it until it's done.
122,00:08:46.17,00:08:46.17,>> JERRI: I guess it doesn't really matter.
123,00:08:48.10,00:08:48.10,"It's such crappy rice, anyway. >> ELISABETH: I felt as if I"
124,00:08:50.60,00:08:50.60,"were under a magnifying glass, and I do not need to be meant to"
125,00:08:54.23,00:08:54.23,"feel that way at all. Like, don't tell me what I'm"
126,00:08:56.67,00:08:56.67,supposed to be doing when I'm making you dinner. Don't.
127,00:08:59.77,00:08:59.77,">> TINA: Whenever you have a whole bunch, it's really hard to"
128,00:09:02.13,00:09:02.13,"make it, I think. Poor little old Elisabeth was"
129,00:09:05.57,00:09:05.57,"sitting there trying to cook the rice, and Jerri made some"
130,00:09:07.40,00:09:07.40,"comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth's feelings,"
131,00:09:10.27,00:09:10.27,"because here she is, trying to help the tribe, and then to not"
132,00:09:13.63,00:09:13.63,be appreciated for it and to be judged-- that's very hurtful.
133,00:09:18.27,00:09:18.27,And I think that right there probably was enough for
134,00:09:21.37,00:09:21.37,"Elisabeth to say, ""You know what?"
135,00:09:23.17,00:09:23.17,"You'll get my vote."" I try to stay away from cooking,"
136,00:09:26.50,00:09:26.50,so I don't have to be judged. >> JERRI: Ah!
137,00:09:31.63,00:09:31.63,">> ELISABETH: Within Ogakor, I already am spotting some cracks."
138,00:09:36.40,00:09:36.40,There is definite dissent between Tina and Jerri.
139,00:09:40.70,00:09:40.70,Does everybody have something to eat with?
140,00:09:44.03,00:09:44.03,">> TINA: Yes. >> ALICIA: Okay, hold on."
141,00:09:44.97,00:09:44.97,>> COLBY: Amber? Thank you. >> Rodger would like to say a
142,00:09:47.70,00:09:47.70,blessing. >> TINA: That's a good idea.
143,00:09:51.70,00:09:51.70,">> You ready? >> RODGER: Yes, everybody ready?"
144,00:09:53.57,00:09:53.57,">> Okay. >> RODGER: Father God, we give"
145,00:09:55.30,00:09:55.30,Thee thanks today for this beautiful Lord's day and for all
146,00:09:57.83,00:09:57.83,"Thy many wonderful blessings. We thank Thee, dear Lord, for"
147,00:10:01.77,00:10:01.77,this opportunity which we have as a group to come to know one
148,00:10:05.47,00:10:05.47,another. >> ELISABETH: If things are
149,00:10:07.67,00:10:07.67,"going to get really crazy, especially now, you know, and"
150,00:10:10.80,00:10:10.80,"seeing that there is a hole in Ogakor, it kind of opens the"
151,00:10:14.47,00:10:14.47,door to really take advantage of that.
152,00:10:16.97,00:10:16.97,"If they're not all together, their plan's kind of wrecked."
153,00:10:21.27,00:10:21.27,>> RODGER: All these things we ask in the name of our lord and
154,00:10:23.27,00:10:23.27,"savior, Jesus Christ. Amen. >> ALL: Amen."
155,00:10:26.20,00:10:26.20,">> TINA: Thank you, Rodger. >> JERRI: That was nice."
156,00:10:28.27,00:10:28.27,>> ELISABETH: It wasn't until today that I really started
157,00:10:30.40,00:10:30.40,"feeling like, ""Okay, Elisabeth, do what you can do to take Kucha"
158,00:10:33.07,00:10:33.07,"to a victory. ""If you want to keep playing"
159,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,"this game... you better get a little more ruthless."""
160,00:11:02.03,00:11:02.03,>> RODGER: I'm going to try to catch something with a cork and
161,00:11:04.43,00:11:04.43,I just bet I don't have any luck.
162,00:11:07.27,00:11:07.27,>> ALICIA: With a cork? >> RODGER: Yeah.
163,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,"Oh, we're just sitting ducks now."
164,00:11:11.10,00:11:11.10,>> ALICIA: You know what? >> RODGER: Sitting ducks sitting
165,00:11:13.27,00:11:13.27,by the fire. >> ALICIA: Whatever.
166,00:11:14.87,00:11:14.87,It's not fun anymore. Laying down and talking to
167,00:11:16.87,00:11:16.87,everybody at night is not as much fun as it used to be.
168,00:11:19.00,00:11:19.00,">> RODGER: No, no, no... >> ALICIA: You know?"
169,00:11:20.83,00:11:20.83,Waking up in the morning and seeing everybody's face-- not as
170,00:11:23.13,00:11:23.13,fun as it used to be. It's not fun anymore.
171,00:11:26.30,00:11:26.30,>> ELISABETH: You're not here to sit back and wait for someone to
172,00:11:27.70,00:11:27.70,vote you off. I just really would love to just
173,00:11:31.67,00:11:31.67,"light a fire under everyone. Well, that makes me sick."
174,00:11:34.97,00:11:34.97,I'm not going to sit here and be a sitting duck.
175,00:11:36.93,00:11:36.93,"No one else wants to keep playing, I'll do whatever it"
176,00:11:39.60,00:11:39.60,"takes to stay out here longest and keep, keep Kucha going."
177,00:11:42.40,00:11:42.40,I think there's a crack in their tribe right now. Watch.
178,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,"You guys, pay attention to Jerri and Tina."
179,00:11:46.93,00:11:46.93,Pay real... >> RODGER: You think it's going
180,00:11:49.33,00:11:49.33,to be women against the men? >> ELISABETH: Pay attention
181,00:11:51.33,00:11:51.33,to... >> ALICIA: No.
182,00:11:52.70,00:11:52.70,">> ELISABETH: No, because I think Jerri and Tina have"
183,00:11:53.97,00:11:53.97,"issues. >> ALICIA: And, well, Jerri and"

367,00:21:24.57,00:21:24.57,"over there, but they've got two extra helpings of rice, so..."
368,00:21:27.40,00:21:27.40,( laughs ) >> JEFF: Great trade off.
369,00:21:29.00,00:21:29.00,">> AMBER: Right, right. ( Amber laughs )"
370,00:21:30.30,00:21:30.30,"Yeah. Things are going good, though,"
371,00:21:32.00,00:21:32.00,"as far as, like, people getting along and everything."
372,00:21:37.13,00:21:37.13,>> ELISABETH: This is the first time since we got here that I
373,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,"feel just, like, kind of just relaxed, hanging out."
374,00:21:41.93,00:21:41.93,>> KEITH: Isn't it nice? >> ELISABETH: Enjoying dinner.
375,00:21:43.40,00:21:43.40,Yeah. >> ALICIA: This is how it...
376,00:21:44.97,00:21:44.97,>> KEITH: What's missing? What's making it feel that way?
377,00:21:46.67,00:21:46.67,What could that be? How can I put my finger on that?
378,00:21:48.37,00:21:48.37,( someone gasps ) >> ...spaghetti.
379,00:21:49.93,00:21:49.93,>> ALICIA: You know what's kind of weird?
380,00:21:51.27,00:21:51.27,>> KEITH: The Wicked Witch of the West isn't here.
381,00:21:52.80,00:21:52.80,>> ALICIA: How could Amber have acted so...
382,00:21:54.27,00:21:54.27,>> KEITH: That's what it is. >> ALICIA: ...surprised that she
383,00:21:56.03,00:21:56.03,was the beauty queen... >> KEITH: It's all fake.
384,00:21:57.77,00:21:57.77,>> ALICIA: ...that knew she was going to win...
385,00:21:59.30,00:21:59.30,">> KEITH: It's all fake. Yeah, exactly."
386,00:22:00.77,00:22:00.77,">> ALICIA: And-And, like, was, like, ""Oh, my god!"""
387,00:22:02.23,00:22:02.23,>> KEITH: Did you see...? >> ALICIA: Did you see her face?
388,00:22:04.23,00:22:04.23,"I looked at her, like, ""Okay, Amber."""
389,00:22:05.60,00:22:05.60,>> KEITH: You chose me?! >> ELISABETH: It was kind of
390,00:22:07.63,00:22:07.63,"funny, because everyone else kind of felt like we won the"
391,00:22:09.93,00:22:09.93,reward. That was probably the one time I
392,00:22:12.07,00:22:12.07,felt like Barramundi. We just kind of hung out.
393,00:22:14.73,00:22:14.73,"Everyone kind of vented about how they feel about Jerri, and"
394,00:22:18.27,00:22:18.27,it was an eye-opener to some people.
395,00:22:20.10,00:22:20.10,"I knew it. >> KEITH: Well, see, I cooked"
396,00:22:21.80,00:22:21.80,"for two Presidents, I've cooked for all kinds of people..."
397,00:22:23.87,00:22:23.87,">> ELISABETH: Have you really? >> KEITH: And I've never, ever,"
398,00:22:25.90,00:22:25.90,ever been stressed. Other than these last so many
399,00:22:27.43,00:22:27.43,days. >> Isn't that weird?!
400,00:22:29.43,00:22:29.43,>> KEITH: Never been stressed. >> I can't believe that.
401,00:22:32.67,00:22:32.67,>> KEITH: Over cooking rice! >> ALICIA: Over rice.
402,00:22:35.37,00:22:35.37,>> Beautiful. >> TINA: I'm so excited.
403,00:22:39.70,00:22:39.70,I love spaghetti. I'm so excited.
404,00:22:42.37,00:22:42.37,>> ELISABETH: This isn't gonna make a difference to me.
405,00:22:44.70,00:22:44.70,"I'll have rice. Honestly, please, because..."
406,00:22:46.83,00:22:46.83,"I'm not kidding. >> TINA: Thank you, Elisabeth."
407,00:22:48.90,00:22:48.90,>> ELISABETH: One of my worst foods.
408,00:22:50.37,00:22:50.37,>> TINA: You are so sweet. Thank you.
409,00:22:51.70,00:22:51.70,"Thank you for, like, Elisabeth, giving some of her spaghetti!"
410,00:22:53.40,00:22:53.40,( laughs ) >> ELISABETH: I just haven't
411,00:22:56.60,00:22:56.60,"seen you enjoy anything like this, Tina, like no reward..."
412,00:23:01.80,00:23:01.80,>> AMBER: Talk about Tina being extra chipper...
413,00:23:04.60,00:23:04.60,She's had a constant smile on her face since the merge.
414,00:23:06.80,00:23:06.80,>> JERRI: Mm-hmm. >> AMBER: She's been talking in
415,00:23:08.97,00:23:08.97,a different voice. >> JERRI: I know.
416,00:23:11.37,00:23:11.37,">> AMBER: ""Oh, you want to go do this?"
417,00:23:12.77,00:23:12.77,"Want to go do that?"" ( speaking gibberish )"
418,00:23:14.37,00:23:14.37,It's unbelievable. She's a completely different
419,00:23:16.03,00:23:16.03,person. >> JERRI: You got to really keep
420,00:23:18.07,00:23:18.07,"your eye on Tina, 'cause she has been acting really weird."
421,00:23:22.17,00:23:22.17,"I'm, like, so sure that she's going to back stab us."
422,00:23:26.70,00:23:26.70,">> AMBER: Oh, I totally agree. >> JERRI: Well... and she'd be"
423,00:23:30.00,00:23:30.00,doing it with people who would be ready to jump ship.
424,00:23:31.77,00:23:31.77,>> AMBER: Yeah. >> JERRI: Jump right on her
425,00:23:33.10,00:23:33.10,ship. >> AMBER: Mm-hmm. It's a
426,00:23:34.87,00:23:34.87,completely different game. >> JERRI: Yeah.
427,00:23:36.50,00:23:36.50,>> AMBER: Isn't it weird? Playing for yourself is
428,00:23:38.00,00:23:38.00,"definitely different. >> JERRI: So, we need to talk to"
429,00:23:40.07,00:23:40.07,Colby. >> AMBER: Yeah.
430,00:23:45.00,00:23:45.00,>> JERRI: To making it to the end.
431,00:23:46.77,00:23:46.77,>> AMBER: Yeah. >> ELISABAETH: I just would
432,00:23:59.00,00:23:59.00,never want to have to make that decision.
433,00:24:00.07,00:24:00.07,">> COLBY: Hey, ladies. >> JERRI: Hi, you guys!"
434,00:24:02.00,00:24:02.00,>> AMBER: Hi. We come bearing gifts.
435,00:24:03.17,00:24:03.17,">> JERRI: You guys, we got boomerangs."
436,00:24:04.10,00:24:04.10,There's one bent one and one straight one for everybody.
437,00:24:06.17,00:24:06.17,>> AMBER: Everybody gets two. It was very weird coming back to
438,00:24:10.03,00:24:10.03,the tribe after we had eaten our meal.
439,00:24:11.83,00:24:11.83,"Like, nobody even turned around to look at us."
440,00:24:15.03,00:24:15.03,It was very uncomfortable. I didn't like the feeling at
441,00:24:16.67,00:24:16.67,all. >> TINA: What kind of dessert
442,00:24:19.07,00:24:19.07,did you get? >> AMBER: I don't want to say
443,00:24:21.53,00:24:21.53,anything. >> JERRI: I know. We-we feel...
444,00:24:22.73,00:24:22.73,guilty. >> TINA: She doesn't want to
445,00:24:23.90,00:24:23.90,hear it. We had a great time.
446,00:24:26.20,00:24:26.20,Don't you feel bad at all. >> COLBY: When Jerri and Amber
447,00:24:28.90,00:24:28.90,"came back, I made my way down to the beach just to get some..."
448,00:24:31.67,00:24:31.67,"grab some time alone, and Jerri came up, sat down beside me and"
449,00:24:36.03,00:24:36.03,decided it was time for us to talk.
450,00:24:37.73,00:24:37.73,>> JERRI: The next person Amber and my concern... with Tina and
451,00:24:41.53,00:24:41.53,Keith taking off and gathering three Kuchas...
452,00:24:44.47,00:24:44.47,>> COLBY: Mm-hmm. >> JERRI: And coming after us.
453,00:24:50.17,00:24:50.17,"She said the same as me-- like, she wouldn't doubt it, after"
454,00:24:54.00,00:24:54.00,that whole episode with Tina before.
455,00:24:56.13,00:24:56.13,It's not good for us to just assume that we can trust her.
456,00:24:59.77,00:24:59.77,Colby's kind of middle ground. Nobody really knows what he's...
457,00:25:01.97,00:25:01.97,"what he's going to do, and he's not really letting anyone onto"
458,00:25:05.27,00:25:05.27,"what his plans are. I mean, have you ever considered"
459,00:25:08.47,00:25:08.47,"maybe... maybe, um... even leading Keith and Tina to"
460,00:25:16.03,00:25:16.03,believe that you want the three of them to be the final three?
461,00:25:21.47,00:25:21.47,>> COLBY: Keith and Tina? >> JERRI: Yeah.
462,00:25:22.90,00:25:22.90,>> COLBY: And myself? >> JERRI: Have you... have you
463,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,"ever thought maybe...? >> COLBY: Oh, they're fully"
464,00:25:26.13,00:25:26.13,convinced that's what's going to happen.
465,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,">> JERRI: Oh, they are? >> COLBY: I mean, they've-"
466,00:25:28.83,00:25:28.83,they've-they've thought that for...
467,00:25:30.30,00:25:30.30,">> JERRI: For a while? >> COLBY: Before the merge,"
468,00:25:31.37,00:25:31.37,"yeah. >> JERRI: Oh, really."
469,00:25:33.37,00:25:33.37,>> COLBY; And that's been my... >> JERRI: And you didn't tell
470,00:25:34.47,00:25:34.47,"me. >> COLBY: Oh, I'm sorry."
471,00:25:35.93,00:25:35.93,That's been my only bargain... That's been my only bargaining
472,00:25:37.03,00:25:37.03,"chip. So, the inevitable came."
473,00:25:40.83,00:25:40.83,I was painted into a corner and- and had to lie to her to
474,00:25:44.00,00:25:44.00,convince her that there wasn't anything going on.
475,00:25:46.07,00:25:46.07,"I just said, ""Look, Jerri, Keith owes me one on this."
476,00:25:48.87,00:25:48.87,"""He and Tina think that the three of us are going into the"
477,00:25:52.53,00:25:52.53,"finals,"" which is the truth, but Jerri thinks it's just a"
478,00:25:54.67,00:25:54.67,ploy. You and I and Amber still have
479,00:26:00.37,00:26:00.37,"complete control of this thing. >> JERRI: Okay, 'cause I-I was"
480,00:26:03.47,00:26:03.47,"completely unaware that, at this point, you were leading Tina and"
481,00:26:08.47,00:26:08.47,Keith to believe that it was going to be the three of you.
482,00:26:10.27,00:26:10.27,>> COLBY: I haven't held led 'em.
483,00:26:11.40,00:26:11.40,They've assumed that. >> JERRI: Okay.
484,00:26:12.37,00:26:12.37,">> COLBY: Jerri doesn't deserve to win this thing, if for no"
485,00:26:15.30,00:26:15.30,"other reason, simply because of the way she's treated the people"
486,00:26:17.70,00:26:17.70,around her. And that was the biggest
487,00:26:19.73,00:26:19.73,decision when I had to choose between carrying my plans out
488,00:26:23.00,00:26:23.00,with either Amber and Jerri or Keith and Tina.
489,00:26:25.70,00:26:25.70,"Yeah, everything's cool. >> JERRI: And this is the deal."
490,00:26:28.23,00:26:28.23,>> AMBER: Do you think it makes sense?
491,00:26:29.23,00:26:29.23,">> JERRI: No, no, I didn't even, like, have to talk to him about"
492,00:26:31.57,00:26:31.57,"that. >> AMBER: Oh, really?"
493,00:26:32.50,00:26:32.50,">> JERRI: Yeah, because he... >> AMBER: Okay, go."
494,00:26:35.00,00:26:35.00,">> JERRI: He, um, filled me in on something I was completely"
495,00:26:37.40,00:26:37.40,unaware of. >> COLBY: Yeah. I didn't like
496,00:26:38.37,00:26:38.37,"the fact that I had to lie, but because I was lying to Jerri, I"
497,00:26:42.13,00:26:42.13,didn't lose sleep over it. >> AMBER: Give me a hug.
498,00:26:46.00,00:26:46.00,I really owe you one. >> COLBY: Are you so full of
499,00:26:48.50,00:26:48.50,"food, you can't? Is that tummy full right now,"
500,00:26:50.03,00:26:50.03,there? >> JERRI: I want a hug.
501,00:26:53.37,00:26:53.37,>> AMBER: The biggest it's ever been.
502,00:26:54.13,00:26:54.13,">> JERRI: I buy it. I-I-I believe him, 'cause-'cause"
503,00:26:56.73,00:26:56.73,"to him... to him, right now, winning means everything."
504,00:26:58.87,00:26:58.87,"So, I mean, I'm... I'm looking at this whole thing right now"
505,00:27:02.13,00:27:02.13,"as, yes, we are working as a team to get to a specific point,"
506,00:27:05.37,00:27:05.37,and so that doesn't leave me feeling very vulnerable at this
507,00:27:08.70,00:27:08.70,"point. >> ALICIA: Oh, boy."
508,00:27:18.87,00:27:18.87,Is that it? >> NICK: Bits and pieces.
509,00:27:21.43,00:27:21.43,"Want to open that? >> ALICIA: No, let's go."
510,00:27:23.37,00:27:23.37,Let's wait. >> NICK: Screw them.
511,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,Open it now. >> ALICIA: ( laughs )
512,00:27:28.63,00:27:28.63,"Hey, you guys, we got tree mail! >> NICK: Ah, let see what we got"
513,00:27:33.67,00:27:33.67,here. I love puzzles.
514,00:27:38.47,00:27:38.47,>> ALICIA: A-ha! One more.
515,00:27:43.83,00:27:43.83,">> NICK: This is the last piece. Probably just a straight line,"
516,00:27:46.40,00:27:46.40,"you guys. ""When marking your land, there"

520,00:27:58.17,00:27:58.17,"immunity you need."" >> ALICIA: Wow."
521,00:28:01.67,00:28:01.67,>> NICK: What can it be? Very interesting.
522,00:28:04.83,00:28:04.83,"Uh, we got tree mail, and, uh, it says for our immunity"
523,00:28:08.50,00:28:08.50,"challenge, uh, we got to keep others out of your land and"
524,00:28:11.67,00:28:11.67,fence each... everybody off. >> AMBER: That is very
525,00:28:14.83,00:28:14.83,interesting. >> TINA: Cool. What if it's like
526,00:28:16.97,00:28:16.97,one of those...? >> ALICIA: Whatever you think it
527,00:28:18.97,00:28:18.97,"is, think something else. >> JERRI: Right, right."
528,00:28:21.83,00:28:21.83,Alicia right now is our biggest threat by far.
529,00:28:25.07,00:28:25.07,"She's got the guns, and she out- strengthens even the men."
530,00:28:30.23,00:28:30.23,"The men are sweating it right now over Alicia, so I think"
531,00:28:35.77,00:28:35.77,"she... she probably knows that, and it's probably very important"
532,00:28:39.50,00:28:39.50,to her to win immunity right now.
533,00:28:41.67,00:28:41.67,">> RODGER: Just... just hang in there and do your best, kiddo."
534,00:28:44.90,00:28:44.90,>> ALICIA: Okay. >> RODGER: All we can... we can
535,00:28:48.47,00:28:48.47,do. >> ALICIA: That's it.
536,00:29:04.37,00:29:04.37,">> JEFF: I'll take back the immunity necklace from you,"
537,00:29:06.87,00:29:06.87,Keith. Put it right back here.
538,00:29:09.97,00:29:09.97,Up for grabs again. Today's immunity challenge has
539,00:29:12.60,00:29:12.60,nothing to do with age or strength.
540,00:29:15.27,00:29:15.27,It's all about how you think. We've created a challenge using
541,00:29:18.47,00:29:18.47,posts and rope. The object of the game: connect
542,00:29:22.40,00:29:22.40,the ropes to the poles to make as many squares as possible.
543,00:29:26.33,00:29:26.33,You'll each take turns connecting one rope at a time.
544,00:29:29.60,00:29:29.60,"If it's your rope that completes the square, you drop a disk in"
545,00:29:32.63,00:29:32.63,"it, you go again. Person with the most squares at"
546,00:29:35.97,00:29:35.97,"the end wins immunity, cannot be voted out at tonight's Tribal"
547,00:29:40.20,00:29:40.20,"Council. Ready to go? Head over here to your disks,"
548,00:29:43.10,00:29:43.10,and we'll start. The order in which you'll take
549,00:29:45.47,00:29:45.47,your turns we determined by drawing numbers outs of a hat.
550,00:29:48.63,00:29:48.63,"Jerri, you're up. You're going to start it."
551,00:29:57.63,00:29:57.63,"Keith. All right, Amber, you're up."
552,00:30:05.63,00:30:05.63,"All right, Tina, you're up. Okay, Alicia, your turn."
553,00:30:11.53,00:30:11.53,"All right, Elisabeth. Go, Kentucky Joe."
554,00:30:18.97,00:30:18.97,"Let's go, Colby. All right, Nick."
555,00:30:24.80,00:30:24.80,"Okay, now it gets a little harder, 'cause any move you"
556,00:30:27.63,00:30:27.63,make's going to either going to give you a box or set somebody
557,00:30:29.47,00:30:29.47,"else up for a run, so choose wisely."
558,00:30:33.20,00:30:33.20,A gift. First on the board. Somebody's going to have a good
559,00:30:41.30,00:30:41.30,run in a minute. Getting tough out there.
560,00:30:44.70,00:30:44.70,>> ALICIA: It's getting tough. >> ELISABETH: You can all thank
561,00:30:46.80,00:30:46.80,me later. Nick can thank me now.
562,00:30:54.90,00:30:54.90,>> JEFF: Nick has one. Amber has one.
563,00:30:58.37,00:30:58.37,>> COLBY: Did you leave Rodger a square?
564,00:30:59.13,00:30:59.13,">> NICK: No. >> COLBY: Come on, Rodg, help"
565,00:31:01.23,00:31:01.23,your brother out. >> JEFF: Now you're brothers.
566,00:31:03.40,00:31:03.40,>> RODGER: Yeah. >> COLBY: Me and Rodg-- we go
567,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,way back. >> RODGER: All family now.
568,00:31:07.10,00:31:07.10,>> COLBY: Four days. >> JEFF: No box for Rodger.
569,00:31:10.30,00:31:10.30,Let's see what he left for Colby.
570,00:31:15.77,00:31:15.77,Colby has one. See if he gets another one.
571,00:31:21.77,00:31:21.77,"Colby has two. >> COLBY: There you go, Jerri."
572,00:31:36.93,00:31:36.93,>> JEFF: Looks like Jerri's on a run.
573,00:31:38.77,00:31:38.77,"Oh, that hurts. Good run. Six."
574,00:31:43.23,00:31:43.23,Jerri in the lead. Keith is anxiously awaiting your
575,00:31:45.87,00:31:45.87,next move. >> JERRI: I'm sure he is.
576,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,">> JEFF: Nine. Keith, you hit the jackpot."
577,00:32:05.50,00:32:05.50,I guess you have Jerri to thank for that. 15.
578,00:32:08.77,00:32:08.77,">> AMBER: Girl, you set him up. >> JERRI: Yes, I did."
579,00:32:11.30,00:32:11.30,>> JEFF: 16. 17.
580,00:32:16.03,00:32:16.03,">> KEITH: All good things come to an end, though."
581,00:32:17.60,00:32:17.60,>> JERRI: I want a massage. >> JEFF: Good run.
582,00:32:20.87,00:32:20.87,Keith in the lead with 17. >> JERRI: Whoo!
583,00:32:22.93,00:32:22.93,">> JEFF: Amber, think you can make a dent in Keith's 17?"
584,00:32:39.37,00:32:39.37,">> AMBER: I got 'em all, right? >> RODGER: Yeah, you got 'em"
585,00:32:40.87,00:32:40.87,"all. >> AMBER: Ah, this is killing"
586,00:32:43.67,00:32:43.67,me! >> TINA: It's killing me too.
587,00:32:47.47,00:32:47.47,">> Let's go. >> AMBER: Oh, you guys."
588,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,>> JEFF: Tina has a plan. 14. 15.
589,00:33:06.37,00:33:06.37,"16. All right, Tina, you got 16. Keith's got 17."
590,00:33:10.53,00:33:10.53,You got to find one more spot on the board.
591,00:33:13.30,00:33:13.30,"This is for immunity. >> TINA: Yep, and I think that's"
592,00:33:15.60,00:33:15.60,"all of mine. >> JEFF: Good effort, Tina."
593,00:33:18.67,00:33:18.67,Not good enough. Mathematically impossible for
594,00:33:21.73,00:33:21.73,"Keith to be beat. Nicely done, Keith."
595,00:33:25.40,00:33:25.40,You get the immunity necklace again.
596,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,Congratulations. >> TINA: Good job.
597,00:33:30.67,00:33:30.67,">> JEFF: Feels good, doesn't it? You're getting used to that."
598,00:33:32.47,00:33:32.47,"All right, you guys can head back to camp."
599,00:33:34.87,00:33:34.87,"I'll see you tonight at Tribal Council, where one of you will"
600,00:33:37.60,00:33:37.60,be voted out of the tribe. Somebody's going home tonight.
601,00:34:06.67,00:34:06.67,">> ELISABETH: Lightning. >> TINA: Whoa, that was close."
602,00:34:18.03,00:34:18.03,( thunder rumbling ) ( lightning crashes )
603,00:34:24.87,00:34:24.87,>> RODGER: I love it here in the Australian outback! Whoo-hoo!
604,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,">> KEITH: Mysteriously, every time we go to Tribal Council, we"
605,00:34:33.40,00:34:33.40,"have a rainstorm. I don't know what that means,"
606,00:34:39.73,00:34:39.73,but you have to think there's something working there of
607,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,stronger powers than we're aware of.
608,00:34:52.37,00:34:52.37,>> ALICIA: Elisabeth thinks that the next vote at Tribal Council
609,00:34:55.57,00:34:55.57,will go for Jerri. I think Elisabeth is naive in a
610,00:34:57.93,00:34:57.93,"lot of ways. You know, Colby and Keith and"
611,00:35:01.50,00:35:01.50,Tina would be foolish to vote Jerri off.
612,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,It would put them at a disadvantage.
613,00:35:06.20,00:35:06.20,So Nick and I both feel like it's going to be one of us that
614,00:35:09.67,00:35:09.67,they're targeting. >> ELISABETH: I'm hoping that
615,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,that swing vote to get Jerri off is Tina.
616,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50,But I really think Jerri is a goner tonight.
617,00:35:20.13,00:35:20.13,And I just want to keep playing. I'm not ready to go home.
618,00:35:23.70,00:35:23.70,"I'm not ready to see my friends go, either."
619,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,Tribal Council is going to be much more interesting than the
620,00:35:29.00,00:35:29.00,"last, and... who knows what is going to happen?"
621,00:36:01.50,00:36:01.50,>> JEFF: Always seems to rain at Tribal Council.
622,00:36:04.67,00:36:04.67,"Elisabeth, talk about the tribes merging, now that you've had a"
623,00:36:07.00,00:36:07.00,few days. Has it been an interesting
624,00:36:10.03,00:36:10.03,dynamic in two different ways of living coming together now and
625,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,forming a new way of living? >> ELISABETH: It has.
626,00:36:16.33,00:36:16.33,"It's been quite interesting. I mean, I think that we probably"
627,00:36:18.47,00:36:18.47,couldn't have done things in a more opposite way when you look
628,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,at the two tribes. I-I just think that the
629,00:36:25.20,00:36:25.20,"differences are known. I mean, sometimes it's tricky,"
630,00:36:28.77,00:36:28.77,"and you get used to doing things your own way, but, um, then you"
631,00:36:33.73,00:36:33.73,"realize that, well, there might be a more efficient way also, so"
632,00:36:36.50,00:36:36.50,"there's been compromise, and I think it's worked to our benefit"
633,00:36:40.47,00:36:40.47,as a group so far. >> JEFF: What was the reaction
634,00:36:44.10,00:36:44.10,"last night, Amber, when you and Jerri came back with little"
635,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,bellies from a nice meal? >> AMBER: It was a very weird
636,00:36:50.30,00:36:50.30,"feeling, a guilty kind of feeling, and I couldn't help but"
637,00:36:54.60,00:36:54.60,feel like somewhat of an outsider for a little while.
638,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,">> JEFF: So, what was it like for you guys not having two"
639,00:37:00.57,00:37:00.57,"people around last night? Different feeling, Alicia?"
640,00:37:03.67,00:37:03.67,>> ALICIA: It was interesting going back to camp just having
641,00:37:05.20,00:37:05.20,"seven people. It was, you know, a little"
642,00:37:07.43,00:37:07.43,"quieter, and everybody was, you know, kind of contemplating the"
643,00:37:10.77,00:37:10.77,"situation, and... and our situation."
644,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03,"Uh, a lot of us had already resigned ourselves to the fact"
645,00:37:16.53,00:37:16.53,"that we'd be having rice that night, so, um... it was... it"
646,00:37:19.63,00:37:19.63,"was all good. >> JEFF: Well, you nine have"
647,00:37:21.53,00:37:21.53,reached... really the final phase: the last leg of Survivor.
648,00:37:27.53,00:37:27.53,"Someone will be voted out of the tribe tonight, but they don't go"
649,00:37:29.30,00:37:29.30,"home. They become a part of that jury,"
650,00:37:34.07,00:37:34.07,"and will have a big part in how this thing plays out, because"
651,00:37:38.37,00:37:38.37,the jury will ultimately decide who the winner is.
652,00:37:41.77,00:37:41.77,"You each have, right now, a one in nine shot at a million bucks."
653,00:37:45.53,00:37:45.53,"So, this game is really shifted now."
654,00:37:48.43,00:37:48.43,The goal is get to the final two with the goodwill of the other
655,00:37:50.90,00:37:50.90,seven. Every vote from here on out
656,00:37:55.83,00:37:55.83,"counts, so you better think about that when you're casting"
657,00:38:00.23,00:38:00.23,"your vote, because the game has changed."
658,00:38:02.67,00:38:02.67,"Let's vote. Elisabeth, you're first."
659,00:38:16.67,00:38:16.67,>> ELISABETH: Tonight I'm voting for Jerri.
660,00:38:19.77,00:38:19.77,"I just feel it's her time to go, and she gets really cranky when"
661,00:38:22.97,00:38:22.97,"she's hungry, and it's bumming me out a little."
662,00:38:48.23,00:38:48.23,">> AMBER: My vote's for Alicia, and girl, you're strong inside"
663,00:38:51.50,00:38:51.50,and out. That's the main reason why I
664,00:38:54.80,00:38:54.80,have to vote for you-- because you're threatening.
665,00:38:57.33,00:38:57.33,"So, this is a respect vote, and I'm going to miss you a lot."
666,00:39:22.03,00:39:22.03,">> RODGER: Nice kid, but way too loud."
667,00:39:24.97,00:39:24.97,"Way too loud. >> JERRI: Alicia, not only do"
668,00:39:44.17,00:39:44.17,"you intimidate the hell out of the women around here, but also"
669,00:39:46.60,00:39:46.60,the men. They are scared to death of you.
670,00:39:53.23,00:39:53.23,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
671,00:39:54.90,00:39:54.90,"( music playing ) Once the votes are tallied, the"
672,00:40:15.37,00:40:15.37,"decision is final, the person will be asked to leave the"
673,00:40:18.33,00:40:18.33,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
674,00:40:25.83,00:40:25.83,First vote... Jerri.
675,00:40:34.63,00:40:34.63,Very muscular... ( laughing )
676,00:40:37.80,00:40:37.80,Alicia. >> ALICIA: Who did that?
677,00:40:40.03,00:40:40.03,Who did that? >> JEFF: Jerri.
678,00:40:50.73,00:40:50.73,Alicia. Alicia.
679,00:41:05.07,00:41:05.07,Alicia. Jerri.
680,00:41:19.07,00:41:19.07,"Jerri. Four votes Jerri, four votes"
681,00:41:22.53,00:41:22.53,Alicia. Final vote...
682,00:41:32.50,00:41:32.50,"Alicia. Alicia, you need to bring me"
683,00:41:35.30,00:41:35.30,your torch. >> ALICIA: Okay.
684,00:41:37.77,00:41:37.77,"Listen, bear in mind, be safe, everybody here."
685,00:41:40.60,00:41:40.60,>> See you in three days. >> ALICIA: See you all in three
686,00:41:42.07,00:41:42.07,"days. Thank you; thanks, guys."
687,00:41:48.37,00:41:48.37,"Thank you, sweetie. Be good."
688,00:41:56.87,00:41:56.87,">> JEFF: Alicia, the tribe has spoken."
689,00:42:03.03,00:42:03.03,"It's time for you to go. >> ALICIA: Bye, guys."
690,00:42:12.37,00:42:12.37,>> JEFF: Grab your torches and head back to camp.
691,00:42:14.67,00:42:14.67,Good night. ( music playing )
692,00:42:34.07,00:42:34.07,>> ALICIA: I have to say that I was expecting this.
693,00:42:36.90,00:42:36.90,"We knew there was going to be a threat, and I just hope somebody"
694,00:42:39.93,00:42:39.93,from Kucha can take this thing out and break Ogakor's spirit.
695,00:42:43.77,00:42:43.77,"It's all good, though. Now I get to sit on the jury and"
696,00:42:47.30,00:42:47.30,"watch everything that happens. Peace, out."
