3,00:00:09.17,00:00:09.17,The tribe set up camp on a newbeach and started from scratch.

5,00:00:16.20,00:00:16.20,first individual immunitychallenge lasted over ten hours.
6,00:00:19.93,00:00:19.93,"Tina stepped down to give themore vulnerable Keith immunity,"
7,00:00:23.57,00:00:23.57,so that the ex-Ogakor tribecould take the advantage at
8,00:00:25.90,00:00:25.90,"Tribal Council.So, we're ruling this a deadlock"
9,00:00:28.43,00:00:28.43,vote.Colby and Jeff were deadlocked
10,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,"into tie, so Jeff's votes atpreviously Tribal Councils"
11,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,"tipped the scales, and Jeff wasvoted out of the tribe."
12,00:00:38.27,00:00:38.27,Nine survivors remain.Who will be voted out tonight?

14,00:01:56.90,00:01:56.90,>> ALICIA: Yeah.>> RODGER: A lot different
15,00:01:59.10,00:01:59.10,than... than us.>> ALICIA: I know.
16,00:02:01.10,00:02:01.10,>> RODGER: Mike would've been upthree hours ago.
17,00:02:02.83,00:02:02.83,">> ALICIA: I know.>> RODGER: Every time I do that,"
18,00:02:05.90,00:02:05.90,I think about old Mike.>> ALICIA: No kidding.
19,00:02:07.67,00:02:07.67,">> RODGER: And, you know, everytime from now on, when we're..."
20,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,"when we're around the fire, wewill think of it."
21,00:02:11.17,00:02:11.17,>> ALICIA: Yep.>> RODGER: After the last Tribal
22,00:02:23.17,00:02:23.17,"Council, I just felt like we hadbeen outwitted by Ogakor."
23,00:02:27.23,00:02:27.23,Kucha's tribe could be pickedoff very easily.
24,00:02:31.13,00:02:31.13,They're in a good position to dothat.
25,00:02:33.20,00:02:33.20,"We could be an extinct tribe, nolonger on the face of the earth."
26,00:02:38.17,00:02:38.17,"To me, it's, uh, one-on-one andevery man for himself from here"
27,00:02:40.77,00:02:40.77,"on out.See, I can catch 'em."
28,00:02:53.40,00:02:53.40,I am in it to win just likeanybody else.
29,00:02:56.33,00:02:56.33,I'm going to give it my bestshot.
30,00:02:58.03,00:02:58.03,My game plan right now to try toassure my survival is try to
31,00:03:02.47,00:03:02.47,"keep catching fish.Ooh, yes."
32,00:03:06.60,00:03:06.60,"If they're going to votesomebody off, it's going to"
33,00:03:08.87,00:03:08.87,probably not be the person thatis supplying 'em with the food.
34,00:03:14.63,00:03:14.63,I think that is my greatestasset at this time.
35,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,"I love this fishing hole. Whoo!>> NICK: Wow, look at that"
36,00:03:36.87,00:03:36.87,crocodile.Do not want to go in that water
37,00:03:41.53,00:03:41.53,again.>> ALICIA: This game has
38,00:03:46.07,00:03:46.07,definitely changed.There's no doubt about it.
39,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,It's a whole new game.New people. New set of rules.
40,00:03:54.33,00:03:54.33,">> NICK: You keep on catchingfish, you'll definitely be the"
41,00:03:56.27,00:03:56.27,last of Kutcha to go.( laughing )
42,00:03:58.93,00:03:58.93,>> ALICIA: Ogakor knows they'rein a good position now to be the
43,00:04:00.93,00:04:00.93,"last five, but they also have toknow that four members on this"
44,00:04:05.33,00:04:05.33,"jury now are going to be Kuchamembers, and these people decide"
45,00:04:11.30,00:04:11.30,who's going to be the winner.They better start stepping up
46,00:04:15.00,00:04:15.00,and being real nice to us.>> KEITH: I feel like I'm on a
47,00:04:34.07,00:04:34.07,fishing trip with you.It's like I'm with... you're my
48,00:04:36.60,00:04:36.60,older brother and taking mefishing.
49,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13,">> RODGER: Everybody is-is realnice to everybody else, but then"
50,00:04:42.70,00:04:42.70,"you can still see groups gettingoff and talking, and you know"
51,00:04:46.23,00:04:46.23,what they're talking about.You know the million dollars for
52,00:04:49.27,00:04:49.27,being the final survivor is oneverybody's mind.
53,00:04:51.90,00:04:51.90,>> AMBER: We're exactly where wewant to be.
54,00:04:54.13,00:04:54.13,">> COLBY: As a team, Ogakor, weoutplayed 'em."
55,00:04:56.67,00:04:56.67,">> AMBER: It's just, like, Ifeel, like, some pressure has"
56,00:04:59.07,00:04:59.07,been lifted off my shoulders.>> COLBY: I agree.
57,00:05:00.33,00:05:00.33,I... I'm sleeping so much betternow after getting past the merge
58,00:05:03.37,00:05:03.37,and the final... the final voteto see who-who grabs the
59,00:05:07.80,00:05:07.80,majority.>> AMBER: I know.
60,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67,>> COLBY: And we won.>> AMBER: Geez!
61,00:05:16.70,00:05:16.70,">> KEITH: Yeah, I think Ogakorwas definitely a team that"
62,00:05:19.37,00:05:19.37,stayed out of vision knowingthat we needed to whittle down
63,00:05:23.47,00:05:23.47,the Kucha people.Kucha knows what we're doing.
64,00:05:27.90,00:05:27.90,"They are really good, nicepeople, which does make it"
65,00:05:30.47,00:05:30.47,harder as the days go on.And the closer you become to an
66,00:05:33.03,00:05:33.03,"individual, you startquestioning, ""Geez, you know, I"
67,00:05:37.63,00:05:37.63,"like this person better thansomebody I know on my own team."""
68,00:05:42.77,00:05:42.77,">> RODGER: Well, if I had toguess, I'd say somebody in your"
69,00:05:44.93,00:05:44.93,all's group is going to be amillionaire.
70,00:05:49.90,00:05:49.90,">> KEITH: Well, you know, helpyourself out, my friend."
71,00:05:53.07,00:05:53.07,It just seems natural thatcertain individuals gravitate to
72,00:05:55.73,00:05:55.73,"each other, and Tina and I havemade the decision that we want"
73,00:05:59.63,00:05:59.63,to be with people we like rightat the very end.
74,00:06:03.67,00:06:03.67,>> ELISABETH: You know Rodgerhas my heart. I love him.
75,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87,>> TINA: He's a good one.>> ELISABETH: I love him.
76,00:06:09.17,00:06:09.17,"See, I knew you guys would hitit off, too."
77,00:06:10.33,00:06:10.33,>> TINA: I like him.You go into a merger thinking
78,00:06:13.73,00:06:13.73,"that you're very much alignedwith a team, but then, as time"
79,00:06:18.07,00:06:18.07,"goes by, you might find out thatthere's people that are more"
80,00:06:21.37,00:06:21.37,"deserving, you know?I want this to be on an"
81,00:06:25.47,00:06:25.47,"individual basis, and I want thegood guys to win."
82,00:06:34.77,00:06:34.77,>> JERRI: Today has been justso... weird.
83,00:06:37.40,00:06:37.40,"I feel, like, a lot of distancebetween myself and everybody"
84,00:06:40.87,00:06:40.87,else right now.We do have the advantage now.
85,00:06:43.40,00:06:43.40,"We're five... Kucha's...to Kucha's four, but that's not"
86,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,relaxing me at all.It's the paranoia again setting
87,00:06:49.90,00:06:49.90,in.We're in a situation where Tina
88,00:06:53.80,00:06:53.80,and Keith could team up with theKucha people.
89,00:06:57.37,00:06:57.37,You cannot be complacent.Your back will be stabbed faster
90,00:06:59.60,00:06:59.60,than you can spit.( clattering )
91,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,Ooh!>> TINA: Ever since the
92,00:07:22.73,00:07:22.73,"beginning, the cooking of therice has been a problem."
93,00:07:26.07,00:07:26.07,"It was a problem at Ogakor, andthe same problem came with us to"
94,00:07:29.50,00:07:29.50,"Barramundi.Basically, what it is is the"
95,00:07:34.07,00:07:34.07,rice has to be cooked to Jerri'sspecifications.
96,00:07:36.93,00:07:36.93,It has to be stirred a certainnumber of times.
97,00:07:38.73,00:07:38.73,"The lid has to stay on.It has to be... perfect, you"
98,00:07:43.07,00:07:43.07,"know, or... you-you catch it.>> What kind of spices we"
99,00:07:47.53,00:07:47.53,"have tonight, ladies?>> ELISABETH: A little parmesan"
100,00:07:50.53,00:07:50.53,pizza mix.>> ALICIA: The lemon pepper is
101,00:07:52.73,00:07:52.73,not great on the rice.>> AMBER: It's not?
102,00:07:54.50,00:07:54.50,>> ALICIA: No.Not great.
103,00:07:57.30,00:07:57.30,">> ELISABETH: Alicia and I wereon the side of the fire, and"
104,00:07:59.70,00:07:59.70,Jerri and Amber were sitting ona log just watching every move
105,00:08:02.17,00:08:02.17,we made.Every time I would... I would
106,00:08:05.77,00:08:05.77,"take a lid off, I could seethem, you know, tensing up,"
107,00:08:08.57,00:08:08.57,"like, you know, ""Why is shetaking the lid off?"
108,00:08:11.53,00:08:11.53,"Why is she stirring now?"">> AMBER: Be careful."
109,00:08:20.97,00:08:20.97,>> TINA: They're not going togo.
110,00:08:22.13,00:08:22.13,They're not going to go.>> AMBER: If you guys have a
111,00:08:24.00,00:08:24.00,"knife, a knife might be easierto stir."
112,00:08:25.20,00:08:25.20,">> ELISABETH: Well, don't evenworry about it."
113,00:08:26.67,00:08:26.67,>> TINA: She actually got it.>> AMBER: You got it?
114,00:08:28.33,00:08:28.33,>> ELISABETH: Alicia and I weregetting more tense trying to
115,00:08:29.47,00:08:29.47,"make it.You know, we were testing the"
116,00:08:31.20,00:08:31.20,rice.We always test to it make sure
117,00:08:33.33,00:08:33.33,"it's done, and Jerri's over onher log."
118,00:08:36.67,00:08:36.67,"""It's mushy,"" she says.>> JERRI: Mashed potatoes."
119,00:08:40.30,00:08:40.30,>> ELISABETH: I know you don'tlike mushy... but it's mushy.
120,00:08:44.03,00:08:44.03,>> ALICIA: I'll stir it untilit's done.
121,00:08:46.17,00:08:46.17,>> JERRI: I guess it doesn'treally matter.
122,00:08:48.10,00:08:48.10,"It's such crappy rice, anyway.>> ELISABETH: I felt as if I"
123,00:08:50.60,00:08:50.60,"were under a magnifying glass,and I do not need to be meant to"
124,00:08:54.23,00:08:54.23,"feel that way at all.Like, don't tell me what I'm"
125,00:08:56.67,00:08:56.67,supposed to be doing when I'mmaking you dinner. Don't.
126,00:08:59.77,00:08:59.77,">> TINA: Whenever you have awhole bunch, it's really hard to"
127,00:09:02.13,00:09:02.13,"make it, I think.Poor little old Elisabeth was"
128,00:09:05.57,00:09:05.57,"sitting there trying to cook therice, and Jerri made some"
129,00:09:07.40,00:09:07.40,"comments about it.It hurt Elisabeth's feelings,"
130,00:09:10.27,00:09:10.27,"because here she is, trying tohelp the tribe, and then to not"
131,00:09:13.63,00:09:13.63,be appreciated for it and to bejudged-- that's very hurtful.
132,00:09:18.27,00:09:18.27,And I think that right thereprobably was enough for
133,00:09:21.37,00:09:21.37,"Elisabeth to say, ""You knowwhat?"
134,00:09:23.17,00:09:23.17,"You'll get my vote.""I try to stay away from cooking,"
135,00:09:26.50,00:09:26.50,so I don't have to be judged.>> JERRI: Ah!
136,00:09:31.63,00:09:31.63,">> ELISABETH: Within Ogakor, Ialready am spotting some cracks."
137,00:09:36.40,00:09:36.40,There is definite dissentbetween Tina and Jerri.
138,00:09:40.70,00:09:40.70,Does everybody have something toeat with?
139,00:09:44.03,00:09:44.03,">> TINA: Yes.>> ALICIA: Okay, hold on."
140,00:09:44.97,00:09:44.97,>> COLBY: Amber? Thank you.>> Rodger would like to say a
141,00:09:47.70,00:09:47.70,blessing.>> TINA: That's a good idea.
142,00:09:51.70,00:09:51.70,">> You ready?>> RODGER: Yes, everybody ready?"
143,00:09:53.57,00:09:53.57,">> Okay.>> RODGER: Father God, we give"
144,00:09:55.30,00:09:55.30,Thee thanks today for thisbeautiful Lord's day and for all
145,00:09:57.83,00:09:57.83,"Thy many wonderful blessings.We thank Thee, dear Lord, for"
146,00:10:01.77,00:10:01.77,this opportunity which we haveas a group to come to know one
147,00:10:05.47,00:10:05.47,another.>> ELISABETH: If things are
148,00:10:07.67,00:10:07.67,"going to get really crazy,especially now, you know, and"
149,00:10:10.80,00:10:10.80,"seeing that there is a hole inOgakor, it kind of opens the"
150,00:10:14.47,00:10:14.47,door to really take advantage ofthat.
151,00:10:16.97,00:10:16.97,"If they're not all together,their plan's kind of wrecked."
152,00:10:21.27,00:10:21.27,>> RODGER: All these things weask in the name of our lord and
153,00:10:23.27,00:10:23.27,"savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.>> ALL: Amen."
154,00:10:26.20,00:10:26.20,">> TINA: Thank you, Rodger.>> JERRI: That was nice."
155,00:10:28.27,00:10:28.27,>> ELISABETH: It wasn't untiltoday that I really started
156,00:10:30.40,00:10:30.40,"feeling like, ""Okay, Elisabeth,do what you can do to take Kucha"
157,00:10:33.07,00:10:33.07,"to a victory.""If you want to keep playing"
158,00:10:36.17,00:10:36.17,"this game... you better get alittle more ruthless."""
159,00:11:02.03,00:11:02.03,>> RODGER: I'm going to try tocatch something with a cork and
160,00:11:04.43,00:11:04.43,I just bet I don't have anyluck.
161,00:11:07.27,00:11:07.27,>> ALICIA: With a cork?>> RODGER: Yeah.
162,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,"Oh, we're just sitting ducksnow."
163,00:11:11.10,00:11:11.10,>> ALICIA: You know what?>> RODGER: Sitting ducks sitting
164,00:11:13.27,00:11:13.27,by the fire.>> ALICIA: Whatever.
165,00:11:14.87,00:11:14.87,It's not fun anymore.Laying down and talking to
166,00:11:16.87,00:11:16.87,everybody at night is not asmuch fun as it used to be.
167,00:11:19.00,00:11:19.00,">> RODGER: No, no, no...>> ALICIA: You know?"
168,00:11:20.83,00:11:20.83,Waking up in the morning andseeing everybody's face-- not as
169,00:11:23.13,00:11:23.13,fun as it used to be.It's not fun anymore.
170,00:11:26.30,00:11:26.30,>> ELISABETH: You're not here tosit back and wait for someone to
171,00:11:27.70,00:11:27.70,vote you off.I just really would love to just
172,00:11:31.67,00:11:31.67,"light a fire under everyone.Well, that makes me sick."
173,00:11:34.97,00:11:34.97,I'm not going to sit here and bea sitting duck.
174,00:11:36.93,00:11:36.93,"No one else wants to keepplaying, I'll do whatever it"
175,00:11:39.60,00:11:39.60,"takes to stay out here longestand keep, keep Kucha going."
176,00:11:42.40,00:11:42.40,I think there's a crack in theirtribe right now. Watch.
177,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,"You guys, pay attention to Jerriand Tina."
178,00:11:46.93,00:11:46.93,Pay real...>> RODGER: You think it's going

181,00:11:52.70,00:11:52.70,">> ELISABETH: No, because Ithink Jerri and Tina have"

486,00:26:19.73,00:26:19.73,decision when I had to choosebetween carrying my plans out
487,00:26:23.00,00:26:23.00,with either Amber and Jerri orKeith and Tina.

605,00:34:39.73,00:34:39.73,but you have to think there'ssomething working there of
606,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,stronger powers than we're awareof.
607,00:34:52.37,00:34:52.37,>> ALICIA: Elisabeth thinks thatthe next vote at Tribal Council
608,00:34:55.57,00:34:55.57,will go for Jerri.I think Elisabeth is naive in a

610,00:35:01.50,00:35:01.50,Tina would be foolish to voteJerri off.
611,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,It would put them at adisadvantage.
612,00:35:06.20,00:35:06.20,So Nick and I both feel likeit's going to be one of us that
613,00:35:09.67,00:35:09.67,they're targeting.>> ELISABETH: I'm hoping that
614,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,that swing vote to get Jerri offis Tina.
615,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50,But I really think Jerri is agoner tonight.

617,00:35:23.70,00:35:23.70,"I'm not ready to see my friendsgo, either."
618,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,Tribal Council is going to bemuch more interesting than the

624,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,forming a new way of living?>> ELISABETH: It has.
625,00:36:16.33,00:36:16.33,"It's been quite interesting.I mean, I think that we probably"
626,00:36:18.47,00:36:18.47,couldn't have done things in amore opposite way when you look
627,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,at the two tribes.I-I just think that the
628,00:36:25.20,00:36:25.20,"differences are known.I mean, sometimes it's tricky,"
629,00:36:28.77,00:36:28.77,"and you get used to doing thingsyour own way, but, um, then you"
630,00:36:33.73,00:36:33.73,"realize that, well, there mightbe a more efficient way also, so"
631,00:36:36.50,00:36:36.50,"there's been compromise, and Ithink it's worked to our benefit"
632,00:36:40.47,00:36:40.47,as a group so far.>> JEFF: What was the reaction
633,00:36:44.10,00:36:44.10,"last night, Amber, when you andJerri came back with little"

649,00:37:34.07,00:37:34.07,"and will have a big part in howthis thing plays out, because"
