321,00:21:07.88,00:21:07.88,"to stay strong, but the weakpart of his plan is, why would I"

323,00:21:18.12,00:21:18.12,">> We will win the next one,I guess."

328,00:21:47.04,00:21:47.04,could go home tonight.There's no one who is safe.
329,00:21:50.17,00:21:50.17,Nobody has immunity and we'reall looking to get each other
330,00:21:52.46,00:21:52.46,out of this game so we can getfurther.
331,00:21:55.04,00:21:55.04,And I'm just hoping that Garyand Amy aren't pulling the wool
332,00:21:57.21,00:21:57.21,over my eyes and everybody justends up voting for me.
333,00:22:00.17,00:22:00.17,"Because honestly, anything,anything can happen at Tribal"

340,00:22:33.21,00:22:33.21,"it sucks, man.>> Even though we won the"
341,00:22:36.71,00:22:36.71,"reward, the barbecue, and I wonindividual immunity, both tribes"
342,00:22:40.04,00:22:40.04,still have to go to TribalCouncil.
343,00:22:42.92,00:22:42.92,So it kind of takes a littlesomething out of the victory
344,00:22:45.21,00:22:45.21,because nobody ever wants to goto Tribal Council.
345,00:22:53.42,00:22:53.42,">> So we're down to what, welose Margaret tonight,"
346,00:22:56.42,00:22:56.42,"then we're down to how many,what, six, right?"

355,00:23:20.25,00:23:20.25,I can do what I want aroundthese people.
356,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,"Rafe, you sure you don't wantthat beer?"
357,00:23:25.29,00:23:25.29,">> Yeah.>> Yeah, man, I got no problem"
358,00:23:27.67,00:23:27.67,"taking it.>> Judd is the person, I think,"
359,00:23:31.62,00:23:31.62,"as a tribe member andas a person, is the most"

363,00:23:42.71,00:23:42.71,"So now I got two beers.>> Well, no, there's only two"
364,00:23:45.04,00:23:45.04,"left.>> Judd does what Judd wants to,"
365,00:23:47.92,00:23:47.92,when he wants to and how hewants to.
366,00:23:51.17,00:23:51.17,The funny part is Judd'sJudd's biggest enemy.
367,00:23:54.71,00:23:54.71,>> There's only two beers left.>> Uh-oh.
368,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67,">> I definitely got one coming,without a doubt."
369,00:24:01.25,00:24:01.25,">> No, one beer's mine.These are mine."

371,00:24:08.54,00:24:08.54,"But, somehow, it ended up thatwhat's left does not equal out"
372,00:24:11.92,00:24:11.92,"to what is owed.So basically, we have a"
373,00:24:15.33,00:24:15.33,"beer-root beer conundrum.>> Who's hiding the beer, man?"
374,00:24:19.67,00:24:19.67,>> There's three beers left.What are you talking about?
375,00:24:22.25,00:24:22.25,">> One is Cindy's half-full one.>> Whenever Judd screws up, Judd"

395,00:25:19.00,00:25:19.00,Because outbursts ofinconsideration like that is
396,00:25:21.79,00:25:21.79,going to be a negative mark onhis slate.

416,00:26:52.96,00:26:52.96,Jamie can be very expressive.And they don't hesitate to just
417,00:26:56.83,00:26:56.83,blurt it all out there.Sometimes you have to learn to
418,00:26:59.71,00:26:59.71,control your emotions when youare on the ball field.
419,00:27:02.62,00:27:02.62,">> PROBST: Judd, chomping at thebit-- what's on your mind?"

445,00:28:03.54,00:28:03.54,"is unsportsman but I have seenit, especially from Judd."

458,00:28:38.54,00:28:38.54,it puts a little bit ofnegativity into the air.
459,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,And negativity is not good forthe entire tribe.
460,00:28:44.25,00:28:44.25,>> PROBST: Margaret?>> Judd doesn't listen to

566,00:35:21.79,00:35:21.79,"Sometimes when two males arecompeting against each other,"
567,00:35:24.04,00:35:24.04,it's like two bulls in a ring.You just get aggressive and you
568,00:35:26.67,00:35:26.67,"know it just kind of came out.Two male people, a lot of"
569,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,testosterone built up and weboth want to win.

578,00:35:55.29,00:35:55.29,athletic person.So I knew I could take whatever
579,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,was handed to me.So when it's time to bring out
580,00:35:59.42,00:35:59.42,"the physical, I will definitelybring it out."

585,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,do it.>> PROBST: A kamikaze that is
586,00:36:12.54,00:36:12.54,"going to bust a wedge.>> This boy right here, he's"
587,00:36:15.21,00:36:15.21,constantly thinking Survivor.The guy knows his game.
588,00:36:18.38,00:36:18.38,"He is just a good old boy, youknow?"

592,00:36:30.88,00:36:30.88,"impression of Brian, when wewere over at Nakum, was he's"

599,00:36:50.62,00:36:50.62,tripped and fell too.>> PROBST: Tweaked it a little
600,00:36:52.62,00:36:52.62,bit?>> Yup.
601,00:36:54.92,00:36:54.92,">> PROBST: Brandon, had to be alittle impressed because, after"
602,00:36:58.21,00:36:58.21,"Amy went down, she could barelyget off of that field, only to"
603,00:37:01.04,00:37:01.04,turn around and have to go backout again.
604,00:37:04.04,00:37:04.04,">> Oh, man, Jeff, you have noidea how impressed I was."
605,00:37:07.00,00:37:07.00,"I mean, Amy got that look on herface and just started going at"
