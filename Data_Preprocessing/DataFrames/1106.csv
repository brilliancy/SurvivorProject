46,00:03:36.79,00:03:36.79,"it happened. >> What do you think, man?"
47,00:03:40.33,00:03:40.33,"Any regrets about last night? >> Um, yeah, some, but that's"
48,00:03:45.38,00:03:45.38,just... it was just a part... a part of that... that was a

56,00:04:29.25,00:04:29.25,we need to start knocking out former Nakum members one by one.
57,00:04:32.25,00:04:32.25,It's got to happen. >> What I don't see is why they
58,00:05:05.21,00:05:05.21,have to bite you through the shirt.
59,00:05:07.62,00:05:07.62,"I mean, do they just have to? >> This morning is kind of like"
60,00:05:13.96,00:05:13.96,every morning. The mosquitoes are horrible.

62,00:05:19.83,00:05:19.83,>> Mosquitoes are thick. Like a hundred times worse than
63,00:05:23.96,00:05:23.96,I have ever seen in Florida in the mangroves in the middle of
64,00:05:26.04,00:05:26.04,the night. That's how bad it is.
65,00:05:34.62,00:05:34.62,>> Everyone is trying to get along really hard.
66,00:05:36.79,00:05:36.79,"Like, you know, I keep trying to be positive and it's harder to"
67,00:05:40.12,00:05:40.12,do that when someone is being really a negative energy around
68,00:05:43.42,00:05:43.42,"camp, which is what Margaret's being right now."
69,00:05:47.33,00:05:47.33,"After Brooke got voted off, she was just devastated, and just"
70,00:05:50.58,00:05:50.58,"took it to so hard. The six of us get along really,"
71,00:05:54.12,00:05:54.12,"really well and Margaret is just, like, kind of fading out."
72,00:06:00.17,00:06:00.17,">> She is miserable, probably because she got stuck with me"
73,00:06:03.67,00:06:03.67,instead of getting stuck with Brandon.
74,00:06:06.04,00:06:06.04,"Instead of getting stuck with Blake, instead of getting stuck"
75,00:06:08.08,00:06:08.08,with Danni or one of them. She got me.
76,00:06:12.17,00:06:12.17,>> I used to be much higher on the food chain than I am now.
77,00:06:17.21,00:06:17.21,Now I'm absolutely on the opposite end after the mix-up.
78,00:06:22.58,00:06:22.58,I'm sure Judd's waiting to get me off.
79,00:06:24.92,00:06:24.92,I'm not giving up. But I'm not going to beat my
80,00:06:27.79,00:06:27.79,head against the wall. I will wait for there to be an
81,00:06:30.12,00:06:30.12,opening. >> You have somebody that has a
82,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,"sore thumb walking around camp, man, miserable."
83,00:06:36.88,00:06:36.88,"That puts the team down, man. We don't need that right now."
84,00:06:39.79,00:06:39.79,>> She just can't grasp the fact that the old tribe ain't coming
85,00:06:45.21,00:06:45.21,"back, man, and this is what you're stuck with."
86,00:06:50.00,00:06:50.00,">> PROBST: Come on in, Nakum. Come on in, Yaxha!"

89,00:07:08.21,00:07:08.21,You guys ready to get to it? First things first.
90,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,"Glad to see that you brought the immunity idol with you,"
91,00:07:17.42,00:07:17.42,"as instructed. It doesn't play a part today,"
92,00:07:19.54,00:07:19.54,though. I will explain that in a minute.
93,00:07:22.25,00:07:22.25,Let's get to today's challenge. Each tribe will put two people
94,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,on opposite sides of a giant ball.
95,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,"On my go, both teams will push the ball against each other."
96,00:07:32.17,00:07:32.17,The object is to maneuver the ball over your own goal line.
97,00:07:35.92,00:07:35.92,"First, you'll put up two women, then you'll put up two men, then"
98,00:07:38.50,00:07:38.50,one of each. First tribe to score three goals
99,00:07:41.29,00:07:41.29,wins reward. Want to know what are you're
100,00:07:43.25,00:07:43.25,playing for? >> Absolutely.
101,00:07:45.17,00:07:45.17,">> PROBST: It's pretty decent. >> Oh, my God!"
102,00:07:48.04,00:07:48.04,">> Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."

105,00:08:01.75,00:08:01.75,So the good news is the winning tribe will feast today.
106,00:08:05.67,00:08:05.67,>> Yes! >> PROBST: The bad news is
107,00:08:08.92,00:08:08.92,"tonight, both tribes are going to Tribal Council."
108,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,Both tribes are voting somebody out.
109,00:08:14.46,00:08:14.46,Two people are going home. There is another element to
110,00:08:18.04,00:08:18.04,this. In addition to the barbecue
111,00:08:20.50,00:08:20.50,"feast, the winning tribe earns the right to compete in another"
112,00:08:23.75,00:08:23.75,challenge immediately following this one for individual
113,00:08:27.17,00:08:27.17,immunity. One tribe member will win this
114,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,immunity necklace. One tribe member will be safe at
115,00:08:32.33,00:08:32.33,their Tribal Council tonight. That person will also sit in on
116,00:08:37.25,00:08:37.25,the other tribe's Tribal Council where they will be able to
117,00:08:39.58,00:08:39.58,gather information. And in a game where knowledge is
118,00:08:42.21,00:08:42.21,"power, this is a crucial opportunity."
119,00:08:45.75,00:08:45.75,"Nakum, you have one extra member."
120,00:08:47.79,00:08:47.79,You're sitting somebody out. >> Lydia.

192,00:13:09.67,00:13:09.67,right away with an advantage. Danni and Amy pushing Margaret
193,00:13:13.25,00:13:13.25,and Cindy back. Margaret and Cindy pushing back
194,00:13:16.75,00:13:16.75,"now. Margaret and Cindy, now trying"
195,00:13:23.04,00:13:23.04,to hold off Danni and an injured Amy.
196,00:13:26.75,00:13:26.75,>> Push! >> Get on the left!

198,00:13:30.92,00:13:30.92,a lot of ground. Amy and Danni with huge
199,00:13:33.25,00:13:33.25,momentum. Yaxha scores.
200,00:13:36.88,00:13:36.88,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: We are tied 2-2!
201,00:13:39.25,00:13:39.25,>> Yes! Yes!
202,00:13:42.83,00:13:42.83,">> PROBST: We are tied up 2-2, this point will decide it,"
203,00:13:46.88,00:13:46.88,"barbecue feast, shot at individual immunity at stake."
204,00:13:50.08,00:13:50.08,We have a new matchup for Yaxha.
205,00:13:52.83,00:13:52.83,Bobby Jon and Brian taking on Judd and Jamie for Nakum.
206,00:13:57.25,00:13:57.25,"Survivors, ready, go! >> Go, go!"
207,00:14:01.75,00:14:01.75,"Yeah! >> Your ball, your ball!"
208,00:14:05.12,00:14:05.12,Yes! >> PROBST: Brian shoved against
209,00:14:07.12,00:14:07.12,the tree. He's lost a lot of leverage.
210,00:14:10.04,00:14:10.04,(shouting) Judd is down!
211,00:14:14.38,00:14:14.38,"Bobby Jon and Brian pushing, making up ground into the"

216,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,And they have it! Nakum wins a barbecue feast and
217,00:14:37.96,00:14:37.96,"a shot at individual immunity. >> PROBST: Yaxha, good effort."
218,00:14:48.38,00:14:48.38,"Amy coming back strong, not enough."
219,00:14:51.17,00:14:51.17,"No reward, no shot at individual immunity."
220,00:14:53.46,00:14:53.46,The only thing you have to look forward to is Tribal Council
221,00:14:55.67,00:14:55.67,tonight. I will see you there.
222,00:14:58.04,00:14:58.04,"Head on back to camp. Nakum, good effort."
223,00:15:02.12,00:15:02.12,Two victories in a row. Barbecue feast is yours.
224,00:15:05.08,00:15:05.08,But that is later. We're not through here yet.
225,00:15:07.21,00:15:07.21,One more challenge. Somebody is going to get
226,00:15:09.04,00:15:09.04,individual immunity for tonight's Tribal Council.
227,00:15:11.50,00:15:11.50,"Follow me and I will explain. All right, the barbecue feast is"
228,00:15:18.67,00:15:18.67,already yours. But this is what you should be
229,00:15:21.12,00:15:21.12,concentrating on now. One of you gets a shot at
230,00:15:23.21,00:15:23.21,individual immunity. Here's how it works:
231,00:15:25.96,00:15:25.96,"On my go, all seven of you will race out into the field to"
232,00:15:29.04,00:15:29.04,collect three bags of letter tiles.
233,00:15:31.21,00:15:31.21,"Each time you untie a bag, you got to bring it back to your"
234,00:15:33.88,00:15:33.88,station. Once you've collected all three
235,00:15:35.96,00:15:35.96,"bags, untie them, empty out 11 letters."
236,00:15:39.00,00:15:39.00,Use those 11 letters to form a two-word phrase.
237,00:15:42.88,00:15:42.88,"First person to spell that phrase correctly wins immunity,"
238,00:15:45.92,00:15:45.92,safe tonight at Tribal Council. Clear?
239,00:15:49.00,00:15:49.00,Take a spot. We'll get started.
240,00:15:51.38,00:15:51.38,"For immunity, Survivors ready? Go!"
241,00:15:57.54,00:15:57.54,"Each time you untie a bag, you bring it back to your station."
242,00:16:01.17,00:16:01.17,"Once you have all three bags, you untie the bags, empty out"
243,00:16:04.25,00:16:04.25,"the letters, start spelling the word."
244,00:16:06.62,00:16:06.62,"Steph back with her first bag, Cindy back with her first bag."
245,00:16:10.25,00:16:10.25,Margaret back with her first bag.
246,00:16:13.25,00:16:13.25,"Lydia, Rafe, Jamie, back with his bag."
247,00:16:16.62,00:16:16.62,Judd bringing up the rear with his first bag.
248,00:16:18.75,00:16:18.75,Stephanie back with bag number two.
249,00:16:20.96,00:16:20.96,Cindy back with bag number two. Margaret and Rafe with their
250,00:16:25.88,00:16:25.88,second bags. Lydia with her second bag.
251,00:16:30.83,00:16:30.83,"Jamie with bag number two. Stephanie has her third bag, she"
252,00:16:34.75,00:16:34.75,can begin emptying the tiles. Cindy back with her third bag.
253,00:16:38.42,00:16:38.42,Rafe in it now. Margaret and Jamie in it now.
254,00:16:41.38,00:16:41.38,Judd in it now. Two-word phrase-- when you think
255,00:16:45.12,00:16:45.12,"you have it, yell it out. Steph has all of her letter"
256,00:16:48.38,00:16:48.38,tiles out. Margaret has all her tiles out.
257,00:16:53.08,00:16:53.08,">> I can't get it freakin' out of the bag, man."
258,00:16:55.71,00:16:55.71,>> PROBST: Judd having trouble even getting his tiles out.
259,00:16:57.83,00:16:57.83,Margaret trying to figure it out.
260,00:17:03.62,00:17:03.62,Rafe very close. Ancient ruin... ancient ruin...
261,00:17:10.92,00:17:10.92,"ancient ruin. >> PROBST: Two word phrase, when"
262,00:17:13.92,00:17:13.92,"you think you have it, yell it out."
263,00:17:16.08,00:17:16.08,>> Got it. >> PROBST: Stop!
264,00:17:18.29,00:17:18.29,Rafe has it first. Ancient Ruin.
265,00:17:20.79,00:17:20.79,Rafe wins immunity. >> Rafe?
266,00:17:23.12,00:17:23.12,>> Thanks. >> Thank you.
267,00:17:26.12,00:17:26.12,">> Judd had it, but he didn't have the puzzle."
268,00:17:28.83,00:17:28.83,Damn! I had it! Next time I got to keep my
269,00:17:32.04,00:17:32.04,"mouth shut, man. >> PROBST: So Judd, you weren't"
270,00:17:35.25,00:17:35.25,"in this challenge at all, you figure out the phrase and say it"
271,00:17:39.04,00:17:39.04,and Rafe gets it. >> I didn't know I was that
272,00:17:41.04,00:17:41.04,"smart, man. >> PROBST: Rafe is wearing"
273,00:17:43.04,00:17:43.04,"immunity. Rafe, come on over."
274,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17,>> Great stuff! >> PROBST: Turn around.
275,00:17:48.92,00:17:48.92,You are safe tonight at Tribal Council.
276,00:17:51.04,00:17:51.04,"So, you guys have a barbecue feast."
277,00:17:53.12,00:17:53.12,Grab it and head out. >> (whoops)
278,00:17:58.62,00:17:58.62,">> Oh, my God! >> Way to go, Nakum!"
279,00:18:09.83,00:18:09.83,">> Good job! >> Whoo! We did it again, kids."
280,00:18:14.08,00:18:14.08,>> We're on a winning streak. >> Today was an amazing day.
281,00:18:17.83,00:18:17.83,Today we won the barbecue and then we had individual immunity
282,00:18:21.00,00:18:21.00,"and I won the first individual immunity, which is awesome!"
283,00:18:24.33,00:18:24.33,">> Good job! >> Right here, baby."
284,00:18:27.25,00:18:27.25,Whoo! That was just an all-around
285,00:18:30.54,00:18:30.54,"good day, man. >> No kidding."
286,00:18:35.58,00:18:35.58,">> What happened to Bobby Jon, man?"
287,00:18:37.79,00:18:37.79,">> Today in that reward challenge, man, Bobby Jon hit a"
288,00:18:39.71,00:18:39.71,"flip switch, man. I was just waiting for him to"
289,00:18:42.04,00:18:42.04,"swing, 'cause I was just going to block that and knock him"
290,00:18:43.88,00:18:43.88,right there. >> He always does that.
291,00:18:45.88,00:18:45.88,>> Why? I'm like why? >> Is he crazy?
292,00:18:49.00,00:18:49.00,>> The guy got right in my face and started screaming because I
293,00:18:51.46,00:18:51.46,was happy because we won. So I started screaming back.
294,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,"I thought it was about to go to blows, you know."
295,00:18:56.17,00:18:56.17,"Just Southern people, we're crazy and we know it."
296,00:18:59.29,00:18:59.29,>> Here's to Nakum. >> To Nakum.
297,00:19:02.21,00:19:02.21,>> And our families that can't be with us.
298,00:19:04.75,00:19:04.75,">> Thank you, guys. >> Thank you, God."
299,00:19:26.96,00:19:26.96,>> Who the hell wants to go to Tribal Council?
300,00:19:29.75,00:19:29.75,It sucks. You know?
301,00:19:31.67,00:19:31.67,"Two in a row, one night after the other."
302,00:19:34.29,00:19:34.29,It's horrible. >> Keep going.
303,00:19:38.17,00:19:38.17,"You too, Danni. >> Well, we all gave everything,"
304,00:19:40.54,00:19:40.54,"I mean, you know. That's just, they're just"
305,00:19:43.62,00:19:43.62,"bigger, more weight, that's all. >> We just can't dwell on it."
306,00:19:53.04,00:19:53.04,>> Mm-hmm. >> Whoa. Whoa!
307,00:19:58.00,00:19:58.00,>> Jamie is kind of cocky and arrogant and there is a line
308,00:20:00.29,00:20:00.29,crossed with me. And he crossed it today.
309,00:20:02.29,00:20:02.29,And I just went over there and I put him in his place.
310,00:20:11.62,00:20:11.62,">> You know, there's another bear out in the woods, too."
311,00:20:17.67,00:20:17.67,>> I am concerned. I felt I let them down when I
312,00:20:21.17,00:20:21.17,fell that second time I went out there.
313,00:20:23.29,00:20:23.29,I went to go push back and my same ankle goes and it snaps.
314,00:20:27.12,00:20:27.12,I wasn't sure what actually happened.
315,00:20:29.08,00:20:29.08,"But, you know, it's okay, 'cause I went out there the next time."
316,00:20:31.33,00:20:31.33,"It's swollen, but I can live with it."
317,00:20:41.92,00:20:41.92,">> As a tribe, we're three former Yaxha, and three former"
318,00:20:45.83,00:20:45.83,"Nakum, everybody is vulnerable. You know, it might be an easy"
319,00:20:48.25,00:20:48.25,"vote to vote out Amy tonight, but would it be our smartest"
320,00:20:50.62,00:20:50.62,vote down the road because Gary and I will be outnumbered by
321,00:20:53.08,00:20:53.08,three former Nakum. >> Brian wants to rejoin Yaxha
322,00:21:07.88,00:21:07.88,"to stay strong, but the weak part of his plan is, why would I"
323,00:21:11.75,00:21:11.75,"get rid of Bobby Jon, one of the strongest players on this team?"
324,00:21:18.12,00:21:18.12,">> We will win the next one, I guess."
325,00:21:27.42,00:21:27.42,>> Amy and Brian are probably in the biggest threat of getting
326,00:21:30.75,00:21:30.75,voted off. Because I don't know what kind
327,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50,"of alliances they have. But you know, they're probably"
328,00:21:36.58,00:21:36.58,"the physically weaker players. >> Of the six of us, any one"
329,00:21:47.04,00:21:47.04,could go home tonight. There's no one who is safe.
330,00:21:50.17,00:21:50.17,Nobody has immunity and we're all looking to get each other
331,00:21:52.46,00:21:52.46,out of this game so we can get further.
332,00:21:55.04,00:21:55.04,And I'm just hoping that Gary and Amy aren't pulling the wool
333,00:21:57.21,00:21:57.21,over my eyes and everybody just ends up voting for me.
334,00:22:00.17,00:22:00.17,"Because honestly, anything, anything can happen at Tribal"
335,00:22:03.96,00:22:03.96,"Council tonight. >> Oh, my God!"
336,00:22:19.12,00:22:19.12,>> I never had a hamburger taste like this.
337,00:22:22.08,00:22:22.08,>> It doesn't get better than this.
338,00:22:25.62,00:22:25.62,">> The only thing that sucks about this, man, is that we've"
339,00:22:27.62,00:22:27.62,got to go to freakin' Tribal Council.
340,00:22:30.58,00:22:30.58,"I just hate that. >> Just gearing up for that,"
341,00:22:33.21,00:22:33.21,"it sucks, man. >> Even though we won the"
342,00:22:36.71,00:22:36.71,"reward, the barbecue, and I won individual immunity, both tribes"
343,00:22:40.04,00:22:40.04,still have to go to Tribal Council.
344,00:22:42.92,00:22:42.92,So it kind of takes a little something out of the victory
345,00:22:45.21,00:22:45.21,because nobody ever wants to go to Tribal Council.
346,00:22:53.42,00:22:53.42,">> So we're down to what, we lose Margaret tonight,"
347,00:22:56.42,00:22:56.42,"then we're down to how many, what, six, right?"
348,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,">> Yeah, six. >> I think Margaret knows she's"
349,00:23:03.71,00:23:03.71,going. She's not even trying to put up
350,00:23:06.04,00:23:06.04,a fight. >> She's always on the
351,00:23:08.00,00:23:08.00,"sidelines, man. >> I go to Tribal Council"
352,00:23:10.17,00:23:10.17,"tonight, man, not a damn worry in the world, man."
353,00:23:13.83,00:23:13.83,"Hell, no, man, they need me, man."
354,00:23:16.04,00:23:16.04,"I'm one of the big guns here, man."
355,00:23:18.12,00:23:18.12,"I'm not saying I'm going overboard, but I feel, you know,"
356,00:23:20.25,00:23:20.25,I can do what I want around these people.
357,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,"Rafe, you sure you don't want that beer?"
358,00:23:25.29,00:23:25.29,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, man, I got no problem"
359,00:23:27.67,00:23:27.67,"taking it. >> Judd is the person, I think,"
360,00:23:31.62,00:23:31.62,"as a tribe member and as a person, is the most"
361,00:23:35.08,00:23:35.08,offensive to the tribe. >> (belches)
362,00:23:37.92,00:23:37.92,">> I give you the whole beer, you give me your hot dog."
363,00:23:41.12,00:23:41.12,>> You want to switch? >> Absolutely.
364,00:23:42.71,00:23:42.71,"So now I got two beers. >> Well, no, there's only two"
365,00:23:45.04,00:23:45.04,"left. >> Judd does what Judd wants to,"
366,00:23:47.92,00:23:47.92,when he wants to and how he wants to.
367,00:23:51.17,00:23:51.17,The funny part is Judd's Judd's biggest enemy.
368,00:23:54.71,00:23:54.71,>> There's only two beers left. >> Uh-oh.
369,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67,">> I definitely got one coming, without a doubt."
370,00:24:01.25,00:24:01.25,">> No, one beer's mine. These are mine."
371,00:24:05.75,00:24:05.75,Each were supposed to have two beers and one root beer.
372,00:24:08.54,00:24:08.54,"But, somehow, it ended up that what's left does not equal out"
373,00:24:11.92,00:24:11.92,"to what is owed. So basically, we have a"
374,00:24:15.33,00:24:15.33,"beer-root beer conundrum. >> Who's hiding the beer, man?"
375,00:24:19.67,00:24:19.67,>> There's three beers left. What are you talking about?
376,00:24:22.25,00:24:22.25,">> One is Cindy's half-full one. >> Whenever Judd screws up, Judd"
377,00:24:26.17,00:24:26.17,"makes a big deal about it, and tries to make it a whole"
378,00:24:29.79,00:24:29.79,explosion so it kind of diffuses the focus on him.
379,00:24:33.17,00:24:33.17,>> I don't understand this whole beer thing.
380,00:24:35.08,00:24:35.08,How are we not...? >> I don't either.
381,00:24:36.83,00:24:36.83,>> It doesn't make any sense. >> I know.
382,00:24:41.04,00:24:41.04,">> We will never figure it out. >> Yeah, but who?"
383,00:24:43.71,00:24:43.71,Whoever drank the beer is going home tonight.
384,00:24:46.08,00:24:46.08,>> Judd's got to watch his mouth.
385,00:24:49.21,00:24:49.21,He gets so pumped up. And his mouth works before his
386,00:24:52.50,00:24:52.50,brain does. >> You had two from you.
387,00:24:55.00,00:24:55.00,And you had one of his and whose else's?
388,00:24:57.08,00:24:57.08,>> How many beers do I have left?
389,00:24:59.12,00:24:59.12,"I had two, right? >> I felt like I freaking"
390,00:25:01.21,00:25:01.21,"deserved it anyway, if I took an extra beer, you wouldn't be"
391,00:25:04.12,00:25:04.12,eating damn hot dog and this cheeseburger if it wasn't for
392,00:25:06.46,00:25:06.46,"me. >> You know what, everybody can"
393,00:25:09.08,00:25:09.08,kiss my ass. And I hope you enjoyed your hot
394,00:25:12.21,00:25:12.21,dog and your hamburger today. >> He's got to stop and think
395,00:25:15.58,00:25:15.58,about what he's saying before it comes out of his mouth.
396,00:25:19.00,00:25:19.00,Because outbursts of inconsideration like that is
397,00:25:21.79,00:25:21.79,going to be a negative mark on his slate.
398,00:25:24.88,00:25:24.88,"And in the end, that could come back to get him."
399,00:26:03.33,00:26:03.33,>> PROBST: All right. Let's start with the
400,00:26:05.96,00:26:05.96,"fun stuff first. Steph, tell me about the feast."
401,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,>> It was awesome. We cooked the hamburgers up
402,00:26:11.17,00:26:11.17,right away. There were a coup of trades
403,00:26:13.12,00:26:13.12,"going on, beer for root beer, root beer for beer."
404,00:26:15.79,00:26:15.79,I traded Judd for a hot dog. He took my beer.
405,00:26:19.25,00:26:19.25,">> Judd, you gave up food for beer?"
406,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,">> Oh, yeah, man. Without a doubt, I'll give up a"
407,00:26:24.08,00:26:24.08,"hot dog for a beer, any day, Jeff."
408,00:26:26.50,00:26:26.50,"Out here in 122 degree weather, I will take a beer any day,"
409,00:26:29.58,00:26:29.58,buddy. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
410,00:26:31.38,00:26:31.38,"today's challenge. Jamie, what happened between you"
411,00:26:33.58,00:26:33.58,"and Bobby Jon? >> I celebrated when I won,"
412,00:26:36.12,00:26:36.12,"because I had so much energy. And he hates losing, so he was"
413,00:26:39.38,00:26:39.38,in my face yelling. I'm from the South; only thing
414,00:26:42.04,00:26:42.04,"I know how to do is yell back. >> PROBST: Margaret, does this"
415,00:26:45.62,00:26:45.62,tribe have good sportsmanship? Are you guys good sports?
416,00:26:48.62,00:26:48.62,">> That's tough, Jeff, because Judd is very vocal and"
417,00:26:52.96,00:26:52.96,Jamie can be very expressive. And they don't hesitate to just
418,00:26:56.83,00:26:56.83,blurt it all out there. Sometimes you have to learn to
419,00:26:59.71,00:26:59.71,control your emotions when you are on the ball field.
420,00:27:02.62,00:27:02.62,">> PROBST: Judd, chomping at the bit-- what's on your mind?"
421,00:27:04.88,00:27:04.88,>> I don't know what the heck Margaret is talking about.
422,00:27:07.04,00:27:07.04,"I mean, it's not like we're being bad sportsmanships at all."
423,00:27:09.21,00:27:09.21,"We just go out there and we give it 120 damn percent, man."
424,00:27:11.79,00:27:11.79,"Whatever it takes, we'll give it."
425,00:27:14.12,00:27:14.12,"That's what I did today, and everybody ate good."
426,00:27:16.33,00:27:16.33,"So, no matter what I do, I'm giving it my damn all, man."
427,00:27:19.00,00:27:19.00,>> PROBST: Giving it your damn  all doesn't mean you are a good
428,00:27:21.12,00:27:21.12,sport or bad sport. There is no equal sign between
429,00:27:22.92,00:27:22.92,"those two words. >> A win is a win, man."
430,00:27:25.00,00:27:25.00,"If we did good, we are going to go out there and go crazy, man."
431,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,It's like scoring a damn touchdown in a football game.
432,00:27:30.38,00:27:30.38,"That gives us more motivation to keep going and going, man."
433,00:27:33.25,00:27:33.25,"Drive it right to them, man. Keep driving it to them."
434,00:27:35.62,00:27:35.62,"That is what we are doing. I mean, that's not bad"
435,00:27:37.62,00:27:37.62,sportsmanship. We just keep on driving and
436,00:27:39.50,00:27:39.50,"driving, man. We'll drive that ball all the"
437,00:27:41.50,00:27:41.50,"way down field until we score a touchdown, man."
438,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50,>> Judd. >> You know what?
439,00:27:45.04,00:27:45.04,"You probably never played a damn sport in your life, anyway,"
440,00:27:47.21,00:27:47.21,"so you don't even know what it is like, man, so you should just"
441,00:27:49.04,00:27:49.04,shut up. >> This is what happens all the
442,00:27:51.12,00:27:51.12,"time. When Judd gets vocal, Judd plows"
443,00:27:54.12,00:27:54.12,over anybody in front of him. He trash talks anybody he
444,00:27:59.21,00:27:59.21,doesn't like. And that's not good
445,00:28:01.21,00:28:01.21,sportsmanship. I'm not saying the whole tribe
446,00:28:03.54,00:28:03.54,"is unsportsman but I have seen it, especially from Judd."
447,00:28:07.12,00:28:07.12,">> PROBST: Judd, you look like if I would let you, you would go"
448,00:28:09.88,00:28:09.88,over and strangle Margaret right now.
449,00:28:12.00,00:28:12.00,">> I'm just... you know, playing sports my whole life, man,"
450,00:28:14.92,00:28:14.92,I wouldn't consider myself a bad sportsmanship.
451,00:28:17.88,00:28:17.88,">> Uh-huh. >> This team that I have here,"
452,00:28:19.88,00:28:19.88,"man, is awesome. I love it, man."
453,00:28:21.88,00:28:21.88,"Except for Margaret, I love this damn team, man."
454,00:28:24.71,00:28:24.71,">> PROBST: Cindy, does this hostility between Judd and"
455,00:28:28.38,00:28:28.38,Margaret concern you a little bit?
456,00:28:31.08,00:28:31.08,">> Well, it concerns all of us because we all have to live, you"
457,00:28:33.38,00:28:33.38,"know, in the same group together and deal with it."
458,00:28:36.12,00:28:36.12,"And when we have two people that don't like each other very much,"
459,00:28:38.54,00:28:38.54,it puts a little bit of negativity into the air.
460,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,And negativity is not good for the entire tribe.
461,00:28:44.25,00:28:44.25,>> PROBST: Margaret? >> Judd doesn't listen to
462,00:28:46.17,00:28:46.17,anybody. Judd only listens to Judd.
463,00:28:48.21,00:28:48.21,>> Let's ask the other team if Judd listens to anybody.
464,00:28:52.08,00:28:52.08,"Cindy, do I listen to everybody? >> Yeah..."
465,00:28:55.08,00:28:55.08,">> Okay, Rafe, do I listen to everybody?"
466,00:28:57.54,00:28:57.54,">> I... I honestly think that... >> Rafe, have an opinion."
467,00:28:59.33,00:28:59.33,Just say yes or no. >> I'm saying my opinion right
468,00:29:01.21,00:29:01.21,now. Time-out.
469,00:29:03.21,00:29:03.21,">> Stephanie when you talk to me, do I listen to you?"
470,00:29:05.08,00:29:05.08,">> Yes, yes. >> Do I listen to you?"
471,00:29:06.50,00:29:06.50,Do I listen to you? >> Yes.
472,00:29:07.88,00:29:07.88,">> There you go. >> But this is what Judd does,"
473,00:29:09.50,00:29:09.50,"Judd bullies, and that's just what he does."
474,00:29:11.75,00:29:11.75,">> You're full of it, man. Get out of here."
475,00:29:14.46,00:29:14.46,">> PROBST: Rafe, put you on the spot a little bit."
476,00:29:16.62,00:29:16.62,Are you intimidated a little bit by Judd?
477,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17,>> I'm really not. I totally was really nervous
478,00:29:21.29,00:29:21.29,about being on the tribe with Judd.
479,00:29:23.12,00:29:23.12,"Judd has a temper, it's obvious, but he has been good to me since"
480,00:29:26.17,00:29:26.17,the day I walked on to this tribe.
481,00:29:28.50,00:29:28.50,>> I just think Judd's high strung.
482,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,He's a lot like me-- can't sit still.
483,00:29:32.67,00:29:32.67,It's hard for him to keep.... >> When I first walked into
484,00:29:34.96,00:29:34.96,"camp, she's telling me that I have A.D.D."
485,00:29:37.12,00:29:37.12,That's how you approach me. That is what you like to say.
486,00:29:39.79,00:29:39.79,"She comes to camp: ""You have A.D.D."
487,00:29:42.12,00:29:42.12,"Do you know that?"" When you first meet somebody, is"
488,00:29:44.21,00:29:44.21,that something nice to say? Is that a compliment?
489,00:29:46.25,00:29:46.25,I have A.D.D.? >> The other problem with Judd
490,00:29:49.25,00:29:49.25,is he has a problem with recall. >> Yeah.
491,00:29:51.96,00:29:51.96,"Did you or did you not, soon as you saw me, did you tell me that"
492,00:29:54.08,00:29:54.08,I had A.D.D.? Is that true or is that false?
493,00:29:57.96,00:29:57.96,"Don't ask me such a stupid question, man."
494,00:30:00.54,00:30:00.54,>> This is what it is like to try to talk to him.
495,00:30:03.21,00:30:03.21,">> Yeah, because I don't want to talk to you."
496,00:30:05.08,00:30:05.08,"And don't talk to me. I won't talk to you, man, that's"
497,00:30:07.25,00:30:07.25,"it. >> PROBST: So, Judd, not a big"
498,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,"question who are you voting for. >> Not a big question at all,"
499,00:30:12.79,00:30:12.79,man. >> PROBST: I have really never
500,00:30:15.12,00:30:15.12,"ever seen anything like this, and I will be honest with you, I"
501,00:30:19.04,00:30:19.04,"have never seen such... >> Hey, Jeff, can I say"
502,00:30:21.25,00:30:21.25,something first? >> PROBST: Of course.
503,00:30:23.00,00:30:23.00,>> Let me say something. She was so miserable that the
504,00:30:26.62,00:30:26.62,"other tribe wasn't coming back, and she got stuck with me."
505,00:30:30.79,00:30:30.79,"That's the bottom line, man. I'm telling you, that's what"
506,00:30:33.62,00:30:33.62,"happened. >> What happened, Jeff, is"
507,00:30:36.08,00:30:36.08,"within two hours, he was up that pyramid, already flipping over"
508,00:30:39.12,00:30:39.12,"on us. It was four old Nakum,"
509,00:30:43.21,00:30:43.21,four old Yaxha. We had a chance to stay strong.
510,00:30:47.04,00:30:47.04,He rolled over right away. >> You would you have done the
511,00:30:49.17,00:30:49.17,"same damn thing to me too, man, if you had the opportunity."
512,00:30:51.58,00:30:51.58,>> I didn't. I didn't. >> Trust me.
513,00:30:53.42,00:30:53.42,">> PROBST: Steph, how do you trust somebody who so quickly"
514,00:30:57.71,00:30:57.71,"dismisses their old tribe and says, ""No, you are my new"
515,00:31:00.38,00:31:00.38,"friends now."" >> Because that is his old"
516,00:31:02.54,00:31:02.54,tribe. We are the new tribe.
517,00:31:04.29,00:31:04.29,I think he embraced his new tribe and is willing to go as
518,00:31:06.46,00:31:06.46,far as we can go together with this tribe.
519,00:31:09.42,00:31:09.42,"What's he going to be like, ""Oh, I'm not going to talk to you"
520,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,"guys, because my old tribe is not on my tribe anymore""?"
521,00:31:14.21,00:31:14.21,"It's retarded. >> PROBST: You know, tonight,"
522,00:31:16.71,00:31:16.71,"watching what is going on with this group, there is a lot of"
523,00:31:18.88,00:31:18.88,"hostility. Cindy, do you think it ends with"
524,00:31:21.62,00:31:21.62,tonight's Tribal Council? Do you get rid of the bad apple
525,00:31:24.21,00:31:24.21,and now the tribe is sound and complete?
526,00:31:26.50,00:31:26.50,>> I think it will be okay for awhile.
527,00:31:29.04,00:31:29.04,We'll have to see what happens in the future.
528,00:31:31.08,00:31:31.08,But I think we all know what we have to do.
529,00:31:34.33,00:31:34.33,">> PROBST: Well, let's find out what it is you have to do."
530,00:31:37.21,00:31:37.21,Rafe is the only person you cannot vote for.
531,00:31:39.17,00:31:39.17,"It is time to vote. Jamie, you're up."
532,00:31:51.71,00:31:51.71,">> Hey, Margaret, if you leave this jungle now, it ain't soon"
533,00:31:54.17,00:31:54.17,"enough, man. Get out, now."
534,00:32:10.54,00:32:10.54,">> Judd, you are a bully. You are self-righteous, you're"
535,00:32:14.83,00:32:14.83,"rude, you're profane-- no one like you deserves a million"
536,00:32:17.25,00:32:17.25,"dollars. My vote is for you, buddy."
537,00:32:30.38,00:32:30.38,>> PROBST: I will go tally the votes.
538,00:32:42.25,00:32:42.25,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
539,00:32:45.21,00:32:45.21,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
540,00:32:47.04,00:32:47.04,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
541,00:32:49.71,00:32:49.71,"First vote, Margaret. Judd."
542,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,"One vote Margaret, one vote Judd."
543,00:33:03.33,00:33:03.33,Margaret: two votes Margaret. Margaret: three votes Margaret.
544,00:33:14.25,00:33:14.25,Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Guatemala.
545,00:33:18.17,00:33:18.17,"Margaret, that's four, that's enough."
546,00:33:20.17,00:33:20.17,"You need to bring me your torch. Margaret, the tribe has spoken."
547,00:33:34.50,00:33:34.50,"It's time for you to go. Well, to paraphrase your words,"
548,00:33:44.79,00:33:44.79,tonight you got rid of the problem.
549,00:33:47.46,00:33:47.46,"If that's true, it should mean happy days at Nakum."
550,00:33:50.92,00:33:50.92,"As part of winning individual immunity today, Rafe earned the"
551,00:33:53.79,00:33:53.79,right to listen in on Yaxha's Tribal Council.
552,00:33:56.79,00:33:56.79,"Rafe, you will move over to the jury area."
553,00:33:59.12,00:33:59.12,"Everybody else, grab your torches."
554,00:34:01.17,00:34:01.17,Head on back to camp. >> This is probably
555,00:34:10.21,00:34:10.21,physically the most challenging thing that I've ever had to do
556,00:34:13.12,00:34:13.12,in my life. And I'm so excited that I did
557,00:34:15.62,00:34:15.62,it. Best wishes to Nakum tribe.
558,00:34:19.17,00:34:19.17,I'm sure that a lot of tension will be gone now.
559,00:34:21.79,00:34:21.79,But I think you will have a lot of troubles with Judd.
560,00:34:25.00,00:34:25.00,So take care. >> PROBST: Now bring in Yaxha.
561,00:35:04.83,00:35:04.83,>> PROBST: Rafe is going to be listening in on your Tribal
562,00:35:07.29,00:35:07.29,Council tonight. It is a right he earned
563,00:35:09.83,00:35:09.83,along with winning individual immunity today.
564,00:35:13.08,00:35:13.08,Let's talk about today's challenge.
565,00:35:16.92,00:35:16.92,"Bobby Jon, what happened with you and Jamie?"
566,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,">> I just got in the heat of the moment, you know."
567,00:35:21.79,00:35:21.79,"Sometimes when two males are competing against each other,"
568,00:35:24.04,00:35:24.04,it's like two bulls in a ring. You just get aggressive and you
569,00:35:26.67,00:35:26.67,"know it just kind of came out. Two male people, a lot of"
570,00:35:29.25,00:35:29.25,testosterone built up and we both want to win.
571,00:35:33.58,00:35:33.58,">> PROBST: Gary, do you consider Nakum to be good sports?"
572,00:35:36.42,00:35:36.42,">> I would say, yes. Every once in a while, I would"
573,00:35:39.04,00:35:39.04,say maybe Jamie has a tendency to get a little excited and
574,00:35:42.04,00:35:42.04,"maybe talk some trash our way, but on the whole, I would say"
575,00:35:45.42,00:35:45.42,"yes. >> PROBST: Brian, you come"
576,00:35:47.42,00:35:47.42,into this game with a certain tendency to work up here.
577,00:35:50.38,00:35:50.38,And now are you being tested with your body.
578,00:35:52.79,00:35:52.79,Do you feel a change happening? >> I have always been an
579,00:35:55.29,00:35:55.29,athletic person. So I knew I could take whatever
580,00:35:57.58,00:35:57.58,was handed to me. So when it's time to bring out
581,00:35:59.42,00:35:59.42,"the physical, I will definitely bring it out."
582,00:36:01.50,00:36:01.50,"But when it's time to bring out the mental, I'll have that ready"
583,00:36:03.46,00:36:03.46,"too. >> PROBST: Bobby Jon, what's"
584,00:36:05.88,00:36:05.88,"your take on Brian? >> I mean, if you want to find"
585,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,"a kamikaze that will bust a wedge, this is the man who about"
586,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,do it. >> PROBST: A kamikaze that is
587,00:36:12.54,00:36:12.54,"going to bust a wedge. >> This boy right here, he's"
588,00:36:15.21,00:36:15.21,constantly thinking Survivor. The guy knows his game.
589,00:36:18.38,00:36:18.38,"He is just a good old boy, you know?"
590,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,"He would be a great neighbor. >> PROBST: Danni, did you ever"
591,00:36:25.50,00:36:25.50,"think you would say Bobby Jon say about Brian, ""He's just a"
592,00:36:27.79,00:36:27.79,"good ol' boy""? >> You know, our first"
593,00:36:30.88,00:36:30.88,"impression of Brian, when we were over at Nakum, was he's"
594,00:36:34.67,00:36:34.67,"strong, and he's just such a gentleman, too, it is all I can"
595,00:36:37.67,00:36:37.67,"say about him. He is definitely strong, he's"
596,00:36:39.42,00:36:39.42,"smart but he is a classy, classy guy."
597,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,">> PROBST: All right, now let's talk about Amy's chronic"
598,00:36:45.00,00:36:45.00,"injury to that ankle. So Amy, how is the ankle?"
599,00:36:48.38,00:36:48.38,">> It's good. I tweaked it a little bit, but I"
600,00:36:50.62,00:36:50.62,tripped and fell too. >> PROBST: Tweaked it a little
601,00:36:52.62,00:36:52.62,bit? >> Yup.
602,00:36:54.92,00:36:54.92,">> PROBST: Brandon, had to be a little impressed because, after"
603,00:36:58.21,00:36:58.21,"Amy went down, she could barely get off of that field, only to"
604,00:37:01.04,00:37:01.04,turn around and have to go back out again.
605,00:37:04.04,00:37:04.04,">> Oh, man, Jeff, you have no idea how impressed I was."
606,00:37:07.00,00:37:07.00,"I mean, Amy got that look on her face and just started going at"
607,00:37:10.79,00:37:10.79,"it, limping and cussing and everything."
608,00:37:13.46,00:37:13.46,"I was, like, man, you know, that is what I like to see-- I"
609,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"mean, go above the odds, you know, and Amy did."
610,00:37:20.08,00:37:20.08,I'm like... I was so impressed with her
611,00:37:22.29,00:37:22.29,"today. >> PROBST: So Bobby Jon, there"
612,00:37:24.33,00:37:24.33,doesn't appear to be an obvious weak link.
613,00:37:26.62,00:37:26.62,But you got to get rid of somebody-- what do you base it
614,00:37:28.62,00:37:28.62,"on? >> Jeff, that's a real good"
615,00:37:31.71,00:37:31.71,question. I think today we all did a lot
616,00:37:33.88,00:37:33.88,of soul-searching and we know that nobody has done anything
617,00:37:36.96,00:37:36.96,wrong to leave. Everybody's giving 110% in
618,00:37:40.04,00:37:40.04,a challenge. Everybody is giving 110% around
619,00:37:42.33,00:37:42.33,"camp. You know, you look up, and"
620,00:37:44.33,00:37:44.33,"somebody's throwing a corn cake in your mouth, you know,"
621,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50,"it going to be a tough one but like you said, it's"
622,00:37:48.88,00:37:48.88,going to happen and this is the way it is.
623,00:37:51.79,00:37:51.79,">> PROBST: All right, one more thing before the vote."
624,00:37:54.25,00:37:54.25,In addition to Rafe being able to sit in and listen to your
625,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,"Tribal Council, he also earned the right to give one of you"
626,00:38:01.42,00:38:01.42,"immunity. Okay, Rafe, here's how it will"
627,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,work: Write the name of the person you
628,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,"want to give immunity to, put it in an envelope, seal it, put it"
629,00:38:13.50,00:38:13.50,in the voting urn. Then come down and get your
630,00:38:16.33,00:38:16.33,torch and head on back to your camp.
631,00:38:18.75,00:38:18.75,Go make your vote. >> Okay.
632,00:38:45.54,00:38:45.54,>> PROBST: You can leave your immunity necklace behind.
633,00:38:48.58,00:38:48.58,"Good night. Okay, Yaxha, Rafe's choice for"
634,00:38:59.17,00:38:59.17,immunity will remain a secret until after your vote.
635,00:39:03.33,00:39:03.33,"Gary, you're up. >> This would be the outwit part"
636,00:39:18.50,00:39:18.50,"of ""outwit, outplay, outlast."" >> Brian, you are a great kid"
637,00:39:36.62,00:39:36.62,with a ton of heart. You have done a remarkable job.
638,00:39:39.12,00:39:39.12,You should be proud of yourself. >> PROBST: I will go tally the
639,00:39:49.38,00:39:49.38,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
640,00:40:02.83,00:40:02.83,decision is final. The person voted out will be
641,00:40:04.79,00:40:04.79,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
642,00:40:07.04,00:40:07.04,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Bobby Jon."
643,00:40:17.00,00:40:17.00,"Brian-- one vote Brian, one vote Bobby Jon."
644,00:40:22.08,00:40:22.08,"Brian: two votes Brian. Brian: that's three votes Brian,"
645,00:40:31.04,00:40:31.04,"one vote Bobby Jon. Brian: that's four votes, that's"
646,00:40:38.04,00:40:38.04,enough to vote you out. You have one shot left.
647,00:40:41.46,00:40:41.46,"Rafe's immunity. Brian, Rafe gave immunity to"
648,00:40:49.58,00:40:49.58,Gary. Seventh person voted out of
649,00:40:52.83,00:40:52.83,"Survivor: Guatemala is Brian. >> Good jobs guys, good luck."
650,00:40:56.83,00:40:56.83,">> Good luck, Brian. >> PROBST: Brian, the tribe has"
651,00:41:07.08,00:41:07.08,"spoken. >> Good luck, guys."
652,00:41:19.12,00:41:19.12,">> PROBST: Well, I got to hand it to you."
653,00:41:21.04,00:41:21.04,You did a great job of pumping Brian up and making him feel
654,00:41:23.50,00:41:23.50,secure. And then you cut his throat.
655,00:41:27.17,00:41:27.17,"If it could happen to him, it could happen to you."
656,00:41:30.00,00:41:30.00,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."

662,00:41:52.92,00:41:52.92,"Survivor, Amy confronts Gary. >> Give me the lowdown"
663,00:41:55.12,00:41:55.12,"on Mr. Gary Hawkins, ex-professional football player."
664,00:41:57.75,00:41:57.75,">> Yeah, I wish. >> If you are and I find out"
665,00:41:59.58,00:41:59.58,"after, I'm going to beat you down."
666,00:42:02.04,00:42:02.04,>> PROBST: And Nakum gets an unexpected visit.
667,00:42:04.83,00:42:04.83,>> Nakum! >> I think the other tribe is

669,00:42:08.75,00:42:08.75,here. >> Hi!
670,00:42:16.62,00:42:16.62,">> Well, I certainly went down fighting-- I know I played this"
671,00:42:19.21,00:42:19.21,game very hard. I did everything I could and I
672,00:42:21.88,00:42:21.88,"did not see that coming, which is how I wanted to go out."
673,00:42:24.17,00:42:24.17,"So the fact they pulled one over on me, I'm really proud of them."
674,00:42:26.67,00:42:26.67,I'm glad they are playing the game.
675,00:42:28.75,00:42:28.75,I never really had to push myself like that before.
676,00:42:30.42,00:42:30.42,So I will take from this experience the fact that I was
677,00:42:32.46,00:42:32.46,able to go into a really difficult situation and come out
678,00:42:33.75,00:42:33.75,feeling great.
