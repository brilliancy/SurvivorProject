616,00:27:08.54,00:27:08.54,I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.
617,00:27:11.08,00:27:11.08,I THOUGHT I COULD DOBETTER THAN THAT.
618,00:27:14.00,00:27:14.00,GAVE IT ALL I HAD.

622,00:27:23.50,00:27:23.50,THAT JEFF SAIDTO DEFINITELY BRING
623,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,IS GOOD NEWS FOR ME.
624,00:27:27.17,00:27:27.17,IT MIGHT NOT BE.

626,00:27:30.25,00:27:30.25,BUT ALL I'M DOING IS HOPING.

635,00:27:58.17,00:27:58.17,SO STEVE'S NOTGOING TO DO ANYTHING
636,00:28:00.17,00:28:00.17,TO CAUSE ANY PROBLEMSWITH ANYBODY.
637,00:28:02.08,00:28:02.08,"RALPH, ON THE OTHER HAND,"

640,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,SO RALPH'S GOT TO GO NEXT.
641,00:28:10.67,00:28:10.67,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEREHAS TO BE A TWIST.
642,00:28:14.25,00:28:14.25,ALWAYS A TWIST.

647,00:28:25.42,00:28:25.42,MAYBE IT'S A SITUATIONWHERE TWO PEOPLE
648,00:28:27.38,00:28:27.38,ARE GOING TO GO HOMEBUT WE ONLY GET TO VOTE ONCE.
649,00:28:29.29,00:28:29.29,IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
650,00:28:30.67,00:28:30.67,SO WE'VE GOT TO HEDGE OUR BETS
651,00:28:32.54,00:28:32.54,AND MAKE SURE WE HAVEBACKUP PLANS
652,00:28:34.83,00:28:34.83,AND KNOW WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR.

662,00:29:17.29,00:29:17.29,WE'RE VOTING FOR RALPH TONIGHT.
663,00:29:19.21,00:29:19.21,"THERE'S ALSO A TWIST, THOUGH,"
664,00:29:20.79,00:29:20.79,"AND WE MAY HAVE TO VOTE OUTTWO PEOPLE TONIGHT,"

676,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17,NOBODY WILL VOTE FOR NIMROD.
677,00:29:59.29,00:29:59.29,SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO BEVOTING FOR ROB TONIGHT.
