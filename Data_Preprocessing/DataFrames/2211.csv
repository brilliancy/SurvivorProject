180,00:07:38.33,00:07:38.33,>> IT GETS HARDER AND HARD TO GET UP EVERY MORNING.
181,00:07:40.96,00:07:40.96,MATT HAD INCREDIBLE STRENGTH
182,00:07:43.33,00:07:43.33,GOING THROUGH REDEMPTION ISLAND THE FIRST TIME.
183,00:07:45.96,00:07:45.96,AFTER HE WAS BLINDSIDED THE SECOND TIME
184,00:07:49.29,00:07:49.29,"BY THE FOLKS HE THOUGHT WERE TRULY HIS FRIENDS,"
185,00:07:53.29,00:07:53.29,HE'S KIND OF BEEN ON A LITTLE DOWNWARD SPIRAL.
186,00:07:58.50,00:07:58.50,>> I'M GONNA GO SIT ON THE BEACH FOR LITTLE WHILE.
187,00:08:00.79,00:08:00.79,>> OKAY.

189,00:08:04.92,00:08:04.92,AND HE'S ABLE TO ENDURE A LOT OF HARDSHIP
190,00:08:08.25,00:08:08.25,BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH IN GOD.
191,00:08:10.25,00:08:10.25,>> POOR MATT. HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S DONE.
192,00:08:12.25,00:08:12.25,">> YEAH, HE'S PRETTY DOWN."
193,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,BUT YOU CAN TELL HE'S KIND OF AT HIS BREAKING POINT.
194,00:08:16.25,00:08:16.25,YOU KNOW IT'S ALL THOSE SUBCONSCIOUS THINGS.
195,00:08:17.96,00:08:17.96,"HE'S ALREADY THINKING ABOUT GOING HOME,"
196,00:08:19.88,00:08:19.88,AND THAT CAN AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF A CHALLENGE.
197,00:08:22.79,00:08:22.79,>> I THINK COMING BACK HERE WAS
198,00:08:24.71,00:08:24.71,"REALLY, REALLY ROUGH ON HIM."
199,00:08:26.50,00:08:26.50,IT TOOK A LOT OF THE WIND OUT OF HIS SAILS
200,00:08:28.75,00:08:28.75,AND AFTER BEING HERE FOR THREE WEEKS AND COMPETING
201,00:08:32.12,00:08:32.12,"IN, LIKE, SIX DUELS."

610,00:26:41.38,00:26:41.38,">> I'M BEAT, MAN."
611,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,">> I THINK THAT US SIX HAVING SO MUCH FAITH IN EACH OTHER,"
612,00:26:49.08,00:26:49.08,I THINK IT WOULD BE SILLY TO GET RID
613,00:26:51.12,00:26:51.12,OF ONE OF OUR OWN BEFORE THE ZAPATERA PEOPLE.
614,00:26:56.08,00:26:56.08,>> PARDON ME?
615,00:26:59.58,00:26:59.58,>> ONE MORE TIME.
616,00:27:05.12,00:27:05.12,>> CAN'T PULL ANOTHER WIN.
617,00:27:08.54,00:27:08.54,I'M DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF.
618,00:27:11.08,00:27:11.08,I THOUGHT I COULD DO BETTER THAN THAT.
619,00:27:14.00,00:27:14.00,GAVE IT ALL I HAD.
620,00:27:16.04,00:27:16.04,"ONE OF US IS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,"
621,00:27:17.58,00:27:17.58,AND IT'S PROBABLY ME.
622,00:27:21.12,00:27:21.12,ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE WHATEVER IS IN THAT LITTLE BOX
623,00:27:23.50,00:27:23.50,THAT JEFF SAID TO DEFINITELY BRING
624,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,IS GOOD NEWS FOR ME.
625,00:27:27.17,00:27:27.17,IT MIGHT NOT BE.
626,00:27:28.62,00:27:28.62,"CHANCES IT BEING FOR ME, NO,"
627,00:27:30.25,00:27:30.25,BUT ALL I'M DOING IS HOPING.
628,00:27:31.83,00:27:31.83,ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE.
629,00:27:33.08,00:27:33.08,>> THOSE CARDS WILL STIR UP SOMETHING TONIGHT.
630,00:27:35.79,00:27:35.79,"ME, I'M READY TO DROP."
631,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17,MY STRENGTH IS-- IS--
632,00:27:45.33,00:27:45.33,MY STOMACH IS JUST SUCKED IN.
633,00:27:51.88,00:27:51.88,>> THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW--
634,00:27:54.50,00:27:54.50,"STEVE'S THINKING, I'VE HAD IT."
635,00:27:56.17,00:27:56.17,I'M DONE.
636,00:27:58.17,00:27:58.17,SO STEVE'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
637,00:28:00.17,00:28:00.17,TO CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS WITH ANYBODY.
638,00:28:02.08,00:28:02.08,"RALPH, ON THE OTHER HAND,"
639,00:28:03.58,00:28:03.58,"POSES A THREAT BECAUSE PHYSICALLY,"
640,00:28:05.42,00:28:05.42,HE'S CAPABLE AND HIS HEAD IS STILL IN THE GAME
641,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,SO RALPH'S GOT TO GO NEXT.
642,00:28:10.67,00:28:10.67,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE HAS TO BE A TWIST.
643,00:28:14.25,00:28:14.25,ALWAYS A TWIST.
644,00:28:15.62,00:28:15.62,>> I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE TWIST.
645,00:28:17.25,00:28:17.25,">> I AM, TOO, BECAUSE THE BALL'S IN OUR COURT."
646,00:28:19.75,00:28:19.75,>> WHO KNOWS WHAT THIS TWIST IS ALL ABOUT.
647,00:28:22.58,00:28:22.58,MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE HAS A CHANCE TO WIN IMMUNITY.
648,00:28:25.42,00:28:25.42,MAYBE IT'S A SITUATION WHERE TWO PEOPLE
649,00:28:27.38,00:28:27.38,ARE GOING TO GO HOME BUT WE ONLY GET TO VOTE ONCE.
650,00:28:29.29,00:28:29.29,IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
651,00:28:30.67,00:28:30.67,SO WE'VE GOT TO HEDGE OUR BETS
652,00:28:32.54,00:28:32.54,AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE BACKUP PLANS
653,00:28:34.83,00:28:34.83,AND KNOW WHO WE'RE VOTING FOR.
654,00:28:36.79,00:28:36.79,"GRANT AND I, WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT GETTING RID OF ANDREA"
655,00:28:39.71,00:28:39.71,"BEFORE ZAPATERA, SO IT LEAVES US OTHER OPTIONS."
656,00:29:00.38,00:29:00.38,">> TONIGHT, IT'S OBVIOUSLY RALPH."
657,00:29:04.33,00:29:04.33,IF IT'S A TWIST AND WE HAVE TO GET RID OF TWO PEOPLE--
658,00:29:07.25,00:29:07.25,>> IF WE HAVE TO VOTE SOMEBODY ELSE OFF.
659,00:29:08.79,00:29:08.79,>> THEN IT'S HER.
660,00:29:10.08,00:29:10.08,">> ROB'S VERY SMART, AND HE'S"
661,00:29:12.50,00:29:12.50,"PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE, AND SO"
662,00:29:14.88,00:29:14.88,WE'RE KIND OF TAKING OUR LEAD FROM HIM.
663,00:29:17.29,00:29:17.29,WE'RE VOTING FOR RALPH TONIGHT.
664,00:29:19.21,00:29:19.21,"THERE'S ALSO A TWIST, THOUGH,"
665,00:29:20.79,00:29:20.79,"AND WE MAY HAVE TO VOTE OUT TWO PEOPLE TONIGHT,"
666,00:29:23.33,00:29:23.33,"IN WHICH CASE, ANDREA WILL GO HOME."
667,00:29:26.17,00:29:26.17,"IF MATT COMES BACK FROM REDEMPTION ISLAND,"
668,00:29:28.50,00:29:28.50,"SHE'S STILL GOT A SOFT SPOT FOR MATT,"
669,00:29:30.38,00:29:30.38,SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO GET HER OUT.
670,00:29:44.83,00:29:44.83,YOU THREE GIRLS COULD TURN THIS
671,00:29:46.38,00:29:46.38,WHOLE THING UPSIDE DOWN.
672,00:29:48.00,00:29:48.00,I WOULD GUARANTEE YOU THAT ROB'S
673,00:29:49.92,00:29:49.92,PRETTY MUCH MAKING THE DECISIONS
674,00:29:52.25,00:29:52.25,WHO COMES AND WHO GOES.
675,00:29:53.58,00:29:53.58,"HE'LL START PICKING YOU GUYS OFF,"
676,00:29:55.00,00:29:55.00,AND TAKE NIMROD WITH HIM TO THE FINALS.
677,00:29:57.17,00:29:57.17,NOBODY WILL VOTE FOR NIMROD.
678,00:29:59.29,00:29:59.29,SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE VOTING FOR ROB TONIGHT.
679,00:30:01.75,00:30:01.75,"IF YOU THREE JUMP IN, IT'S YOUR GAME."
680,00:30:05.12,00:30:05.12,>> WE'LL CONSIDER.
681,00:30:06.42,00:30:06.42,THANK YOU.
682,00:30:19.42,00:30:19.42,>> STEVE CAME UP TO US AND WAS BASICALLY LIKE
683,00:30:23.25,00:30:23.25,"OUR TWO VOTES ARE GOING FOR ROB,"
684,00:30:25.50,00:30:25.50,"SO IF YOU THREE GIRLS WANT TO MAKE A BIG MOVE,"
685,00:30:28.12,00:30:28.12,"LIKE, NOW'S THE TIME, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."
686,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,"WHICH, OBVIOUSLY, WE DIDN'T ENTERTAIN."
687,00:30:33.29,00:30:33.29,>> I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO DO THIS.
688,00:30:35.29,00:30:35.29,"IT'S THEIR LAST ATTEMPT, AND THAT'S WHY"
689,00:30:37.17,00:30:37.17,THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET ANYTHING THEY CAN
690,00:30:38.92,00:30:38.92,AND DO WHATEVER THEY CAN.
691,00:30:40.88,00:30:40.88,SO LET'S JUST HANG IN THERE.
692,00:30:43.17,00:30:43.17,>> YEAH.
693,00:30:44.79,00:30:44.79,>> IT SEEMED LIKE STEVE MAY HAVE GOTTEN HIS SECOND WIND.
694,00:30:47.33,00:30:47.33,HE'S GOING TO MEMBERS OF MY ALLIANCE BEHIND MY BACK
695,00:30:49.67,00:30:49.67,"TRYING TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO GET ME OUT OF HERE,"
696,00:30:52.33,00:30:52.33,WHICH MAKES ME THINK I SHOULD MAYBE GET RID OF HIM FIRST.
697,00:30:55.83,00:30:55.83,WHAT I WAS ORIGINALLY THINKING ABOUT
698,00:30:58.08,00:30:58.08,I'M THINKING ABOUT NOT DOING NOW
699,00:31:00.08,00:31:00.08,BECAUSE I MAY HAVE TO WAIT TO GET RID OF ANDREA.
700,00:31:14.00,00:31:14.00,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
701,00:31:19.96,00:31:19.96,DAVID AND JULIE.
702,00:31:27.75,00:31:27.75,"ROB, THE LAST THREE TRIBAL COUNCILS,"
703,00:31:29.92,00:31:29.92,"ZAPATERA, ZAPATERA, ZAPATERA."
704,00:31:31.75,00:31:31.75,IS THAT WHERE WE ARE AGAIN?
705,00:31:33.21,00:31:33.21,IS IT GOING TO BE STEVE OR RALPH?
706,00:31:35.08,00:31:35.08,>> MOST LIKELY.
707,00:31:36.79,00:31:36.79,UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
708,00:31:38.67,00:31:38.67,">> Jeff: STEVE, YOU KIND OF SENSE THAT,"
709,00:31:41.04,00:31:41.04,THAT THIS OMETEPE GROUP IS UNBREAKABLE?
710,00:31:43.83,00:31:43.83,">> SURE, YEAH, THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL."
711,00:31:45.50,00:31:45.50,WE'VE TRIED TO STIR IT UP AND RAISE A LITTLE HAVOC.
712,00:31:48.38,00:31:48.38,"WE'VE TOLD VARIOUS GROUPS WHO RALPH AND I ARE VOTING FOR,"
713,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,"AND IF THEY WANT TO JUMP ON BOARD,"
714,00:31:55.08,00:31:55.08,IT COULD BE HUGE TONIGHT.
715,00:31:56.50,00:31:56.50,">> Jeff: ANDREA, STEVE DOES MAKE A GOOD POINT."
716,00:31:59.21,00:31:59.21,"AT MOST, THE OMETEPE SIX HAVE TWO MORE VOTES."
717,00:32:02.33,00:32:02.33,STEVE AND RALPH.
718,00:32:03.71,00:32:03.71,THERE IS A CERTAIN TIME WHEN IT
719,00:32:05.29,00:32:05.29,MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO SAY I'M MAKING A MOVE.
720,00:32:07.71,00:32:07.71,">> I MEAN, IT DOES MAKE SENSE STRATEGICALLY,"
721,00:32:10.29,00:32:10.29,BUT I FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE THAT WE'RE ALL ROCK SOLID
722,00:32:13.25,00:32:13.25,BECAUSE WE REALLY DO FEEL LIKE WE'VE WORKED HARD
723,00:32:15.29,00:32:15.29,TO GET TO THE PLACE THAT WE'RE AT.
724,00:32:17.62,00:32:17.62,">> Jeff: RALPH, ODDS ARE, TONIGHT'S VOTE,"
725,00:32:20.21,00:32:20.21,ONE OF YOU TWO ARE GOING HOME.
726,00:32:21.79,00:32:21.79,">> WELL, I WENT A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE GAME TONIGHT."
727,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,I'D SAY IT'S GOING TO BE ME.
728,00:32:26.08,00:32:26.08,">> Jeff: STEVE, HOW ABOUT YOU?"
729,00:32:28.42,00:32:28.42,>> I'M THINKING IT MOST LIKELY WOULD BE RALPH.
730,00:32:32.29,00:32:32.29,RALPH'S BEEN REALLY TOUGH IN THE CHALLENGES.
731,00:32:34.21,00:32:34.21,BETTER PERFORMING THAN MYSELF.
732,00:32:36.33,00:32:36.33,SO...
733,00:32:38.12,00:32:38.12,">> Jeff: ROB, THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO SAY IF YOU'RE STEVE."
734,00:32:40.58,00:32:40.58,"""I DON'T HAVE MUCH ENERGY."
735,00:32:42.21,00:32:42.21,I'M KIND OF WORTHLESS IN CHALLENGES.
736,00:32:44.04,00:32:44.04,"VOTE HIM OUT."""
737,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,>> IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO SAY IF HE WANTS TO STAY.
738,00:32:48.21,00:32:48.21,>> UH-HUH.
739,00:32:49.54,00:32:49.54,">> BUT, JEFF, YOU CAN'T TAKE STEVE'S"
740,00:32:51.67,00:32:51.67,"LACKADAISICAL ANSWER AS ""I'M QUITTING."""
741,00:32:54.12,00:32:54.12,THE DUDE PLAYED IN THE NFL.
742,00:32:56.38,00:32:56.38,HE'S NOT QUITTING.
743,00:32:57.42,00:32:57.42,>> Jeff: NOT A QUITTER.
744,00:32:58.42,00:32:58.42,>> HE'S NOT A QUITTER.
745,00:32:59.54,00:32:59.54,>> I WOULD SECOND WHAT GRANT JUST SAID
746,00:33:01.42,00:33:01.42,BECAUSE I'M RECOGNIZING THAT HE'S NOT AS FEEBLE
747,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,AS BEING PUT OUT THERE.
748,00:33:07.21,00:33:07.21,I THINK HE COULD STEP UP AT THE RIGHT CHALLENGE.
749,00:33:09.62,00:33:09.62,GOTCHA.
750,00:33:12.25,00:33:12.25,">> Jeff: STEVE, BEFORE WE GO TO THE VOTE,"
751,00:33:14.08,00:33:14.08,THIS COULD BE YOUR LAST CHANCE TO SPEAK UP.
752,00:33:16.71,00:33:16.71,">> I REMIND THE GIRLS OF THE SEASONS PAST,"

755,00:33:26.46,00:33:26.46,SO IT WILL GET BRUTAL AFTER RALPH AND I ARE GONE.
756,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,SO IT'S NOW OR NEVER TO DO SOMETHING LARGE.

759,00:33:38.92,00:33:38.92,ROB MADE AN ALLIANCE WITH AMBER
760,00:33:41.21,00:33:41.21,ALL THE WAY TO THE END AND SHE BEAT HIM.
761,00:33:43.08,00:33:43.08,THERE WAS ONE CRITICAL MOMENT WHERE HE NEEDED HELP

763,00:33:47.83,00:33:47.83,HE CUT HIS THROAT.
764,00:33:49.58,00:33:49.58,THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS HE DIDN'T BETRAY AMBER.
765,00:33:53.08,00:33:53.08,"IN FACT, HE HASN'T BETRAYED HER SINCE."
766,00:33:56.04,00:33:56.04,>> THAT'S TRUE.

769,00:34:01.58,00:34:01.58,HE COULD TAKE YOU ALL THE WAY.

788,00:35:29.38,00:35:29.38,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
