18,00:00:36.42,00:00:36.42,BOTH TRIBES ARE GOING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.
19,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,BOTH TRIBES WILL VOTE SOMEBODY OUT OF THIS GAME.
20,00:00:43.96,00:00:43.96,"AT LA FLOR, BRENDA AND SASH WERE IN COMPLETE CONTROL."
21,00:00:47.29,00:00:47.29,THEY WANTED TO FLUSH OUT MARTY'S HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
22,00:00:50.21,00:00:50.21,AND BLIND-SIDE KELLY B.
23,00:00:51.88,00:00:51.88,">> IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN,"
24,00:00:53.54,00:00:53.54,WE'LL BE ABLE TO KILL A COUPLE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

28,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,"AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO."
29,00:01:08.38,00:01:08.38,BUT HE SHOCKED THEM BY HOLDING ON TO IT.
30,00:01:11.08,00:01:11.08,"MARTY'S GAMBLE PAID OFF, BECAUSE HE KEPT HIS IDOL"
31,00:01:13.67,00:01:13.67,AND KELLY B. WENT HOME.
32,00:01:15.62,00:01:15.62,"KELLY B., THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
33,00:01:18.46,00:01:18.46,NOW MARTY AND HIS ALLY JILL ARE TWO AGAINST FIVE.
34,00:01:23.38,00:01:23.38,"AT THE ESPADA TRIBAL COUNCIL, THE YOUTH HAD TO DECIDE"
35,00:01:26.25,00:01:26.25,"BETWEEN YVE, WHOSE STRENGTH COULD HELP THEM IN CHALLENGES,"
36,00:01:29.33,00:01:29.33,"OR DAN, WHO, BECAUSE OF HIS BAD KNEE, WOULD NEVER BE A THREAT."
37,00:01:34.08,00:01:34.08,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
38,00:01:36.00,00:01:36.00,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE
39,00:01:37.96,00:01:37.96,THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
40,00:01:39.17,00:01:39.17,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
41,00:01:40.42,00:01:40.42,"IN THE END, YVE'S STRENGTH WAS HER UNDOING."
42,00:01:42.88,00:01:42.88,"YVE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."

52,00:02:17.17,00:02:17.17,"BECAUSE EVERY TIME THEY'D TRY AND GET HIM ON SOMETHING,"
53,00:02:19.54,00:02:19.54,IT COULD NEVER STICK.
54,00:02:21.33,00:02:21.33,SO I FEEL LIKE TEFLON DAN.
55,00:02:23.12,00:02:23.12,">> AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, WE DISCUSSED THE ORIGINAL PLAN"
56,00:02:26.29,00:02:26.29,"AND VOTE YVE OUT TONIGHT,"
57,00:02:28.38,00:02:28.38,BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT DAN'S PERFORMANCE.
58,00:02:30.75,00:02:30.75,IT'LL DEFINITELY BE A HARD PILL TO SWALLOW
59,00:02:32.33,00:02:32.33,IF DAN COSTS US THE CHALLENGES.
60,00:02:33.92,00:02:33.92,"BUT WE'VE MADE OUR DECISIONS, WE'VE MADE OUR BEDS,"
61,00:02:35.75,00:02:35.75,AND WE'VE GOT TO LAY IN IT.
62,00:02:44.75,00:02:44.75,>> ALINA IS STRONG
63,00:02:47.92,00:02:47.92,AND SHE'S VERY SMART.
64,00:02:50.83,00:02:50.83,"FROM DAY ONE, SHE HAD THESE EYES"
65,00:02:52.83,00:02:52.83,THAT CAN JUST SEE STRAIGHT THROUGH YOU.
66,00:02:55.25,00:02:55.25,I NEVER TRUSTED HER AT ALL.
67,00:02:57.21,00:02:57.21,SO WE NEED TO GET ALINA OUT NEXT.
68,00:02:59.58,00:02:59.58,AND THAT'S FOR SURE.
69,00:03:00.62,00:03:00.62,>> MM-HMM.
70,00:03:01.71,00:03:01.71,>> ALL RIGHT? >> OKAY.

75,00:03:25.17,00:03:25.17,>> WHY ANY VOTES ON ME? WHAT WERE THE VOTES ON ME?
76,00:03:28.88,00:03:28.88,WHAT WAS THAT?
77,00:03:31.00,00:03:31.00,>> YOU HAVE THE IDOL.
78,00:03:32.33,00:03:32.33,">> YOU GOT TO HAVE BIG, BIG CAJONES"
79,00:03:34.42,00:03:34.42,"TO PULL THE MOVE THAT I PULLED TONIGHT,"
80,00:03:36.50,00:03:36.50,"WHICH IS, I DID NOT PLAY THE IMMUNITY IDOL."
81,00:03:39.38,00:03:39.38,"I SENSED THAT YOU GUYS WANTED TO FLUSH THE IDOL,"
82,00:03:42.29,00:03:42.29,BUT SOMETHING IN MY GUT SAID
83,00:03:45.75,00:03:45.75,THAT THAT WASN'T TOTALLY BULL ... SO...
84,00:03:48.00,00:03:48.00,"I KEPT THAT IMMUNITY IDOL IN MY POCKET,"
85,00:03:50.25,00:03:50.25,"AND I DEBATED LONG AND HARD,"
86,00:03:52.96,00:03:52.96,"AND SOMETHING TOLD ME HANG ON TO IT, AND I WAS RIGHT."
87,00:03:56.21,00:03:56.21,I ALSO NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF JANE.
88,00:03:58.67,00:03:58.67,"OBVIOUSLY, JANE VOTED FOR ME TONIGHT,"
89,00:04:00.50,00:04:00.50,SO THAT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH.
90,00:04:02.79,00:04:02.79,"I'M JUST SITTING HERE SEETHING ABOUT JANE, ACTUALLY."
91,00:04:05.29,00:04:05.29,"I HAVE NEVER LIED TO HER ONCE,"
92,00:04:07.12,00:04:07.12,"I HAVE NEVER MISLED HER, I'VE NEVER VOTED FOR HER."
93,00:04:09.50,00:04:09.50,SHE TURNED ON ME.
94,00:04:11.12,00:04:11.12,"SHE'S A DESPERATE ONE AND SHE HAS BEEN FROM THE BEGINNING,"
95,00:04:13.67,00:04:13.67,AND SHE'S GOT TO GO.
96,00:04:15.29,00:04:15.29,>> SHE'S NEXT. >> SHE'S PISSING ME OFF.
97,00:05:21.29,00:05:21.29,">> HEY, THE ONE THING I WANTED TO SAY"
98,00:05:23.17,00:05:23.17,"AFTER LAST NIGHT TO YOU IS... ACTUALLY, LIKE, THREE THINGS."
99,00:05:25.96,00:05:25.96,ONE IS...
100,00:05:28.00,00:05:28.00,"I HAVE NEVER, EVER LIED TO YOU."
101,00:05:30.21,00:05:30.21,"UNLESS YOU TELL ME RIGHT NOW YOU THINK I'VE LIED ABOUT SOMETHING,"
102,00:05:33.21,00:05:33.21,I'LL SET IT STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW.
103,00:05:34.46,00:05:34.46,>> I DON'T THINK YOU'VE LIED. >> I HAVE NEVER...
104,00:05:36.12,00:05:36.12,"I HAVE NEVER, EVER ONCE LIED TO YOU."
105,00:05:37.79,00:05:37.79,"I'VE NEVER MISREPRESENTED MYSELF TO YOU IN THIS GAME,"
106,00:05:40.29,00:05:40.29,NOT EVEN ONCE.

108,00:05:43.25,00:05:43.25,"AND I HAVE NEVER, EVER SUGGESTED THAT YOUR NAME SHOULD GO DOWN."
109,00:05:47.08,00:05:47.08,"THEY ALL TOLD US YOU WERE GOING, BUT WHEN I SAW EVERYTHING TURN,"
110,00:05:50.17,00:05:50.17,"THAT'S WHY I TURNED TO YOU AND SAID, ""VOTE FOR BRENDA,"""

112,00:05:55.29,00:05:55.29,I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS GOING.
113,00:05:57.12,00:05:57.12,I FELT LIKE THEY HAD TURNED ON US.
114,00:05:59.33,00:05:59.33,SO I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR ON WHAT ALL THEIR STRATEGY WAS.
115,00:06:02.71,00:06:02.71,I THINK THEY WANTED TO FLUSH THE IDOL OUT.
116,00:06:05.08,00:06:05.08,"TWO, THEY WANTED TO GET RID OF KELLY B., BUT THEY WERE WORRIED"
117,00:06:08.58,00:06:08.58,THAT KELLY B. HAD MAYBE COME AND TALKED TO US
118,00:06:11.21,00:06:11.21,AND THAT WE WOULD USE KELLY B. TO FLIP ON THEM.
119,00:06:13.96,00:06:13.96,>> BE A FOURSOME. >> RIGHT.
120,00:06:15.29,00:06:15.29,">> AND WE HAD NO IDEA, I NEVER, EVER HAD A CLUE."

590,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,">> JANE, ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR MARTY?"
591,00:28:41.92,00:28:41.92,">> I'M SORRY, I WAS THE UGLY DUCKLING OVER THERE."
592,00:28:45.33,00:28:45.33,>> YOU'RE A PRIZED POSSESSION OVER HERE.
593,00:28:47.83,00:28:47.83,">> I'M A FIRM BELIEVER, WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND."
594,00:28:52.83,00:28:52.83,"MARTY AND JILL HAVE TREATED ME LIKE I DON'T EXIST FROM DAY ONE,"
595,00:28:57.71,00:28:57.71,GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE ESPADA TRIBE.
596,00:29:01.21,00:29:01.21,"I MEAN, I REALLY FELT LIKE THE UGLY DUCKLING OVER THERE,"
597,00:29:04.50,00:29:04.50,"AND I KNOW I GAINED THE RESPECT OF BRENDA,"
598,00:29:07.96,00:29:07.96,"PURPLE KELLY, FABIO AND SASH."
599,00:29:10.79,00:29:10.79,"SO AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, I HOPE MARTY GOES HOME."
600,00:29:13.92,00:29:13.92,IT'S STILL ICING ON THE CAKE IF JILL GOES HOME. (\\LAUGHS\\)
601,00:29:16.79,00:29:16.79,"I WANT THE CAKE, AND I WANT TO EAT IT, TOO,"
602,00:29:19.17,00:29:19.17,AND I WANT BOTH OF THEM GONE. (\\LAUGHS\\)
603,00:29:22.04,00:29:22.04,>> WHY DON'T I DO THIS?
604,00:29:23.79,00:29:23.79,WHY DON'T I GO UP TO MARTY AND TELL HIM IT'S GOING TO BE
605,00:29:27.25,00:29:27.25,"THREE VOTES FOR YOU, TWO VOTES FOR JILL,"
606,00:29:29.62,00:29:29.62,"WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO PLAY YOUR IDOL TONIGHT,"
607,00:29:31.58,00:29:31.58,OR... I GUARANTEE YOU...
608,00:29:34.00,00:29:34.00,>> YOU WON'T GO HOME.
609,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,">> ...JILL WILL GO HOME, AND GIVE ME THE IDOL"
610,00:29:37.38,00:29:37.38,SO THAT WE HAVE IT
611,00:29:42.04,00:29:42.04,">> RIGHT NOW THE GAME PLAN IS,"
612,00:29:44.17,00:29:44.17,"PUT THREE OF OUR VOTES ON MARTY AND TWO ON JILL,"
613,00:29:47.21,00:29:47.21,"AND TELL MARTY, LIKE, ""BRO, YOU GOTTA PLAY THE IDOL NOW,"""
614,00:29:50.71,00:29:50.71,"SO HE DOES, AND THEN IT WILL BE A TIE"
615,00:29:53.42,00:29:53.42,BETWEEN JILL AND WHOEVER MARTY... AND JILL VOTE.
616,00:29:57.46,00:29:57.46,"AND THEN ON THE REVOTE, JILL WOULD END UP GOING HOME."
617,00:30:03.12,00:30:03.12,>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
618,00:30:04.71,00:30:04.71,>> I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER THIS.
619,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,ASK MARTY FOR THE IDOL.
620,00:30:09.29,00:30:09.29,"TELL HIM, ""YOU'RE SAFE, GIVE US THE IDOL,"
621,00:30:12.12,00:30:12.12,"WE'LL VOTE OUT JILL,"" AND THEN WE VOTE HIM OUT."
622,00:30:16.75,00:30:16.75,>> THE... THEN THE ONLY PROBLEM
623,00:30:19.83,00:30:19.83,I SEE WITH THAT IS THAT JILL
624,00:30:22.67,00:30:22.67,WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO ALLEGIANCE
625,00:30:25.25,00:30:25.25,OR CONFIDENCE IN US.
626,00:30:26.79,00:30:26.79,>> IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER WAY.
627,00:30:28.46,00:30:28.46,"YOU THINK SHE WILL EVER, EVER, EVER TRUST US?"
628,00:30:30.96,00:30:30.96,WE JUST VOTED OUT MARTY.
629,00:30:32.42,00:30:32.42,>> TH-THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. >> OR-OR WE VOTE OUT HER.
630,00:30:34.83,00:30:34.83,"EITHER ONE, THEY DON'T TRUST US, AND THEY NEVER WILL TRUST US."
631,00:30:38.08,00:30:38.08,"THEY'RE NOT THAT DUMB, SASH."
632,00:30:40.00,00:30:40.00,TONIGHT EITHER MARTY OR JILL IS GOING TO GO HOME.
633,00:30:42.25,00:30:42.25,THAT'S THE PLAN.
634,00:30:43.79,00:30:43.79,"SASH AND I ARE BOTH STUCK ON WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO,"
635,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,"AND WE'RE WONDERING, WHAT IF WE COULD BE,"
636,00:30:49.21,00:30:49.21,"LIKE, SUPER MEAN, ASK MARTY FOR THE IDOL AND VOTE HIS ASS OUT."
637,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33,">> I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SUCH A TOUGH DAY, DUDE."
638,00:31:04.42,00:31:04.42,SO... WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS...
639,00:31:08.62,00:31:08.62,THEY'LL SPLIT THE VOTE THREE TO TWO TONIGHT.
640,00:31:12.42,00:31:12.42,>> THREE VOTES FOR YOU; >> YEAH.
641,00:31:14.42,00:31:14.42,">> TWO VOTES FOR JILL, >> YEAH."
642,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,">> IN HOPES THAT-THE THE IDOL IS FLUSHED,"
643,00:31:20.21,00:31:20.21,">> YEAH. >> UM, AND THEN IT'D GO TO A TIE"
644,00:31:22.62,00:31:22.62,"AND THEN IN A TIEBREAKER, JILL WOULD GO HOME."
645,00:31:25.54,00:31:25.54,">> YEAH. >> UM, THE OTHER OPTION"
646,00:31:28.29,00:31:28.29,TO STRENGTHEN US...
647,00:31:30.08,00:31:30.08,"YOU HAND THE IDOL OVER AND I LOOK YOU IN THE EYE,"
648,00:31:33.25,00:31:33.25,"MAN TO MAN, AND SHAKE YOUR HAND"
649,00:31:35.08,00:31:35.08,THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT.
650,00:31:37.17,00:31:37.17,">> RIGHT. YEAH, BUT I..."
651,00:31:38.75,00:31:38.75,>> WOULD YOU DO THAT? >> I'D JUST GO HOME NEXT TIME.
652,00:31:41.21,00:31:41.21,">> LOOK, IF THIS HAPPENS, IF YOU GIVE IT TO ME,"
653,00:31:43.62,00:31:43.62,"UM, I'LL LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND SHAKE YOUR HAND AGAIN."
654,00:31:46.96,00:31:46.96,"IF WE LOSE THE NEXT IMMUNITY CHALLENGE,"
655,00:31:49.92,00:31:49.92,I'M GONNA GIVE YOU BACK THE IDOL.
656,00:31:55.29,00:31:55.29,"YOU KNOW, JILL'S GOING HOME, REGARDLESS."
657,00:31:59.96,00:31:59.96,">> I CAN'T VOTE FOR HER. >> NO, NO, NO."
658,00:32:01.92,00:32:01.92,>> I HOPE YOUR PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.
659,00:32:03.75,00:32:03.75,">> NO, NO, NO. YOU... YOU'LL VOTE FOR..."
660,00:32:07.21,00:32:07.21,">> JANE. >> JANE, BRENDA,"
661,00:32:08.33,00:32:08.33,WHOEVER YOU WANT.
662,00:32:09.92,00:32:09.92,"I THINK IT MAKES SENSE, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S..."
663,00:32:13.21,00:32:13.21,"YOU KNOW, I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR OWN IDOL, SO..."
664,00:32:19.08,00:32:19.08,>> RIGHT NOW I FEEL...
665,00:32:21.46,00:32:21.46,ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS IN EVERY...
666,00:32:26.00,00:32:26.00,"WAY, SHAPE OR FORM."
667,00:32:28.04,00:32:28.04,IF I KEEP THE IDOL...
668,00:32:30.08,00:32:30.08,"I HAVE TO USE THE IDOL TONIGHT, SO..."
669,00:32:32.71,00:32:32.71,"I GIVE SASH THE IDOL, AND MAYBE I GO HOME TONIGHT,"
670,00:32:35.92,00:32:35.92,MAYBE I DON'T.
671,00:32:37.00,00:32:37.00,"I GOT TO GIVE THE IDOL TO SOMEBODY,"
672,00:32:39.25,00:32:39.25,SO I'M EITHER GIVING IT TO JEFF TONIGHT
673,00:32:41.08,00:32:41.08,OR I'M GIVING IT TO SASH.
674,00:32:44.46,00:32:44.46,"A CURSE AT TIMES, A GOOD THING AT TIMES--"
675,00:32:48.21,00:32:48.21,THE IMMUNITY IDOL IS YOURS.
676,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,">> THANK YOU, BROTHER."
677,00:32:51.92,00:32:51.92,"WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, OKAY?"
678,00:32:54.38,00:32:54.38,>> IT'S IN YOUR HANDS.
679,00:32:56.29,00:32:56.29,"I'D RATHER GIVE IT TO SASH,"
680,00:32:58.21,00:32:58.21,"BECAUSE MAYBE, IF HE LIVES UP TO HIS WORD,"
681,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,I WOULD MAYBE LIVE ONE MORE CYCLE.
682,00:33:04.04,00:33:04.04,ONE MORE CYCLE COULD POTENTIALLY GET ME
683,00:33:06.54,00:33:06.54,"TO THE MERGE, AND THEN THINGS ARE WIDE OPEN."
684,00:33:14.25,00:33:14.25,">> WELL, IT TURNS OUT I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DIG FOR IDOLS."
685,00:33:17.17,00:33:17.17,ALL I HAVE TO DO IS ASK FOR THEM.
686,00:33:19.50,00:33:19.50,PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY
687,00:33:20.67,00:33:20.67,HAND ME AN IDOL
688,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,JUST BECAUSE I MAY OR MAY NOT KEEP THEM IN THE GAME
689,00:33:26.50,00:33:26.50,A LITTLE LONGER.
690,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,MARTY MADE A BIG MISTAKE.
691,00:33:30.29,00:33:30.29,THAT'S PROBABLY HIS BIGGEST MISTAKE IN THE GAME.
692,00:34:05.00,00:34:05.00,">> Jeff: SO FABIO, BACK-TO-BACK LOSSES, REWARD AND IMMUNITY."
693,00:34:09.21,00:34:09.21,DOES ESPADA HAVE MOMENTUM?
694,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,>> YEAH. I THINK THEIR SPIRITS ARE UP.
695,00:34:13.42,00:34:13.42,I THINK THEY HAVE MOMENTUM.
696,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,I THINK THEY'RE A STRONG TRIBE.
697,00:34:16.62,00:34:16.62,I THINK WE'RE ALSO STRONG.
698,00:34:19.04,00:34:19.04,"I THINK TOMORROW OR THE NEXT REWARD CHALLENGE,"
699,00:34:21.83,00:34:21.83,I THINK IT WILL STILL BE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD.
700,00:34:24.08,00:34:24.08,"BUT, YEAH, THEY'RE FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOW."
701,00:34:25.88,00:34:25.88,">> Jeff: JANE, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL WAS CRAZY."
702,00:34:28.42,00:34:28.42,"PEOPLE BEING SURPRISED, DOUBLE CROSSES."
703,00:34:31.17,00:34:31.17,WHAT WAS THE VIBE BEFORE THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL?
704,00:34:34.21,00:34:34.21,>> SOME OF US GOT TOGETHER AND TALKED;
705,00:34:37.58,00:34:37.58,"THE ONES OF US THAT HAVE MESHED TOGETHER REALLY GOOD,"
706,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,AND WE MADE A DECISION.
707,00:34:43.12,00:34:43.12,">> Jeff: IS IT OBVIOUS, JANE, WHO DOESN'T MESH TOGETHER?"
708,00:34:45.29,00:34:45.29,WHO'S ON THE OUTSIDE?
709,00:34:46.54,00:34:46.54,>> UH-HUH.
710,00:34:47.92,00:34:47.92,>> Jeff: AND DO THEY KNOW THEY'RE ON THE OUTSIDE?
711,00:34:50.12,00:34:50.12,>> I THINK SO. MM-HMM.
712,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,">> Jeff: MARTY, DO YOU FEEL THAT?"
713,00:34:53.75,00:34:53.75,THERE'S A SENSE OF BEING IN WITH THE GROUP
714,00:34:56.04,00:34:56.04,AND BEING OUTSIDE OF THE GROUP?
715,00:34:57.21,00:34:57.21,">> YEAH, CLEARLY."
716,00:34:58.38,00:34:58.38,"I MEAN, WE CAME IN AS A MINORITY INTO THIS TRIBE,"
717,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"AND SOME OF US DID MORE OF A FLIP-FLOP,"
718,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,AND SOME OF US JUST TRIED TO INCORPORATE OURSELVES
719,00:35:05.46,00:35:05.46,WHERE WE FELT WE FIT IN.
720,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,>> Jeff: WHO FLIP-FLOPPED?
721,00:35:08.33,00:35:08.33,>> I THINK JANE'S A FLIPPER.
722,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,SHE'LL GO WHEREVER THE WIND BLOWS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE
723,00:35:13.46,00:35:13.46,"THAT SHE SAVES HER OWN SKIN,"
724,00:35:15.25,00:35:15.25,AND WE TRIED TO REMAIN STRONG
725,00:35:17.29,00:35:17.29,AND TRIED TO FIT IN WITH WHOEVER WE COULD.
726,00:35:19.38,00:35:19.38,">> Jeff: ""WE"" MEANING YOU AND JILL."
727,00:35:20.92,00:35:20.92,">> JILL AND I, YEAH."
728,00:35:22.21,00:35:22.21,">> Jeff: JANE, FAIR CRITICISM?"
729,00:35:24.21,00:35:24.21,">> WELL, WHEN WE BECAME YELLOW, I BECAME YELLOW."
730,00:35:27.12,00:35:27.12,AND THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.
731,00:35:29.29,00:35:29.29,">> Jeff: BRENDA, COULD YOU FEEL THAT FROM JANE?"
732,00:35:31.88,00:35:31.88,>> TOTALLY.
733,00:35:33.08,00:35:33.08,FROM DAY ONE.
734,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,SHE JUST... SHE'S JUST VERY GENUINE.
735,00:35:36.25,00:35:36.25,"SHE NEVER REALLY TRIED TO MAKE AN ALLIANCE,"
736,00:35:38.75,00:35:38.75,IT JUST BECAME A NATURAL FRIENDSHIP.
737,00:35:41.83,00:35:41.83,">> Jeff: JILL, DO YOU FEEL THE SEPARATION?"
738,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,">> OH, DEFINITELY. FROM THE MINUTE WE GOT TO CAMP,"
739,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,CLEARLY IT'S AN OLD/YOUNG DIVISION THAT STILL EXISTS.
740,00:35:50.33,00:35:50.33,"SO IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING TO BE PUT IN THAT SITUATION,"
741,00:35:53.08,00:35:53.08,BUT IT'S MY OBLIGATION TO PLAY OUT OF IT IF I CAN.
742,00:35:55.71,00:35:55.71,">> Jeff: MARTY, LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL"
743,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE IDOL,"
744,00:36:00.08,00:36:00.08,"AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAD IT, WOULD YOU PLAY IT OR NOT."
745,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,DID THAT COME UP AGAIN TODAY?
746,00:36:04.33,00:36:04.33,">> OH, SURE. AND YOU COULD ARGUE"
747,00:36:05.75,00:36:05.75,THAT MAYBE IT WAS THE STUPIDEST MOVE NOT TO PLAY IT
748,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
749,00:36:09.58,00:36:09.58,OR YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IT WAS THE GUTSIEST MOVE.
750,00:36:11.88,00:36:11.88,BUT I WENT WITH MY GUT INSTINCTS AND DECIDED TO HOLD ONTO IT.
751,00:36:15.00,00:36:15.00,"BUT TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I FEEL LIKE"
752,00:36:17.62,00:36:17.62,I MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE THIS EVENING.
753,00:36:21.21,00:36:21.21,I'M AT A DISADVANTAGE NOW.
754,00:36:23.08,00:36:23.08,"AND SO DO YOU DO SOMETHING, TRUST SOMEBODY AND TRANSFER"
755,00:36:26.38,00:36:26.38,"THE POWER OF THE IDOL, AND MAYBE IF THINGS WORK OUT AND YOU TAKE"
756,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,"A RISK, IT BUYS YOU A LITTLE MORE TIME IN THIS GAME, WHICH,"
757,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,"IT'S A CRAZY GAME, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN."
758,00:36:34.46,00:36:34.46,">> Jeff: BRENDA, WORRIED ABOUT WHERE THE IDOL IS?"
759,00:36:36.71,00:36:36.71,DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE IDOL IS?
760,00:36:38.21,00:36:38.21,">> WELL, I DON'T KNOW PHYSICALLY WHERE IT IS."
761,00:36:40.12,00:36:40.12,I THINK SASH HAS IT.
762,00:36:41.29,00:36:41.29,">> JEFF, THE IDOL IS IN MY POCKET."
763,00:36:47.08,00:36:47.08,>> I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS IN HIS POCKET.
764,00:36:50.54,00:36:50.54,">> Jeff: SO MARTY, WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE IDOL?"
765,00:36:53.42,00:36:53.42,">> IN TALKING TO SASH, WE AGREED"
766,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,THAT I WOULD TRANSFER THE IDOL TO HIM.
767,00:36:59.12,00:36:59.12,>> Jeff: SO YOU GAVE YOUR IDOL TO SASH?
768,00:37:02.46,00:37:02.46,>> I DID. IT COULD GO DOWN
769,00:37:04.29,00:37:04.29,AS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST MOVES EVER OR MAYBE NOT.
770,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,">> Jeff: FABIO, REASONABLE OF MARTY TO BE A LITTLE CONCERNED"
771,00:37:11.29,00:37:11.29,THAT HE MIGHT HAVE JUST MADE A BLUNDER?
772,00:37:13.75,00:37:13.75,">> YEAH, I THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE"
773,00:37:15.46,00:37:15.46,BECAUSE WE COULD EASILY VOTE HIM OUT TONIGHT.
774,00:37:17.83,00:37:17.83,"BUT EITHER WAY,"
775,00:37:19.17,00:37:19.17,"WE HAVE THE IDOL, SO I THINK WE COME OUT ON TOP."
776,00:37:23.21,00:37:23.21,">> Jeff: BRENDA, IT'S INTERESTING THAT FABIO SAYS,"
