627,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
628,00:33:13.80,00:33:13.80,AND I DON'T THINK HER GAME IS GOOD ENOUGH TO KEEP HER MOUTH
629,00:33:16.10,00:33:16.10,SHUT.
630,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,I DON'T KNOW.

662,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,SO I HAVE TO DECIDE DO I WANT TO GO WITH THE GIRLS OR DO I WANT
663,00:34:49.13,00:34:49.13,TO STICK TO MY BLUE-COLLAR ALLIANCE?
664,00:34:51.70,00:34:51.70,>> ACTUALLY I'M JUST READY FOR THE GIRLS.
