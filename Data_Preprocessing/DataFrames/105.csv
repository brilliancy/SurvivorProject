2,00:00:02.17,00:00:02.17, JEFF PROBST:  16 Americans forced to abandon ship
3,00:00:05.10,00:00:05.10, in the middle     of the South China sea...
4,00:00:08.07,00:00:08.07," Marooned for 39 days,  they must work together"
5,00:00:12.00,00:00:12.00,"  to build shelter, find food  and survive the island"
6,00:00:16.17,00:00:16.17,"  but, ultimately,  it is everyone for themselves."
7,00:00:20.63,00:00:20.63,  Every third night
8,00:00:21.87,00:00:21.87, they will hike   deep into the jungle
9,00:00:23.60,00:00:23.60, to take part   in the Tribal Council
10,00:00:25.47,00:00:25.47, where they must vote     one of their own
11,00:00:27.00,00:00:27.00, off the island.
12,00:00:29.37,00:00:29.37,"  In the end,   only one will remain,"
13,00:00:31.80,00:00:31.80,  and will leave the island     with $1 million in cash.

15,00:00:39.53,00:00:39.53,  Last week on Survivor...
16,00:00:41.60,00:00:41.60,  ( thunder crashing )
17,00:00:43.37,00:00:43.37,RAMONA:  It was the worst night
18,00:00:45.23,00:00:45.23,I've ever slept.
19,00:00:47.03,00:00:47.03,  Gretchen decided
20,00:00:48.23,00:00:48.23,  she wouldn't sleep  one more night
21,00:00:49.73,00:00:49.73,  in their poorly constructed     shelter.
22,00:00:51.90,00:00:51.90, I don't want to sleep in that anymore.
23,00:00:53.40,00:00:53.40, I don't want to  be antisocial
24,00:00:54.40,00:00:54.40, but I'm going
25,00:00:55.40,00:00:55.40, in the woods.
26,00:00:57.07,00:00:57.07, JEFF:   Ramona felt like an outcast
27,00:00:59.03,00:00:59.03, and wanted to redeem herself.
28,00:01:01.13,00:01:01.13,"Want to play rough, huh?"
29,00:01:02.87,00:01:02.87,"JENNA:  She's trying,  but I think maybe it is"
30,00:01:04.73,00:01:04.73, a little too little too late.
31,00:01:06.60,00:01:06.60," JEFF:  At Tagi tribe, Sue continued  her quest to find more food..."
32,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50,  Tapioca. Tapioca's supposed to have red lines and...
33,00:01:13.10,00:01:13.10,Got to find the tapioca.
34,00:01:14.67,00:01:14.67,  While Sean worked   on other island necessities.
35,00:01:16.77,00:01:16.77, SEAN:   I had this vision.
36,00:01:18.40,00:01:18.40,   I thought I'd build myself a bowling alley
37,00:01:20.17,00:01:20.17,   right about here.
38,00:01:21.53,00:01:21.53,SUSAN:  Sean sits there for five hours
39,00:01:22.80,00:01:22.80, and builds his bowling alley.
40,00:01:24.40,00:01:24.40,  I'm tired of feeding people that don't do anything.
41,00:01:26.33,00:01:26.33, My parents would be so proud.
42,00:01:28.47,00:01:28.47," JEFF:   A cunning plan was hatched  by Sue, Kelly and Rich."
43,00:01:31.80,00:01:31.80," RICH:  So, the, um..."
44,00:01:33.10,00:01:33.10, alliances have begun.
45,00:01:35.07,00:01:35.07,The whole point   of forming an alliance is so
46,00:01:36.90,00:01:36.90,we're all going to vote  the same way.
47,00:01:38.30,00:01:38.30, JEFF:   Tagi was on a roll.
48,00:01:39.80,00:01:39.80,  They won  the reward challenge...
49,00:01:41.07,00:01:41.07,   Go get it.
50,00:01:42.07,00:01:42.07," And, then..."
51,00:01:43.07,00:01:43.07, the Immunity Challenge.
52,00:01:45.07,00:01:45.07,  ( cheering )
53,00:01:46.07,00:01:46.07," So, a distraught Pagong tribe"
54,00:01:48.17,00:01:48.17, had to return    to Tribal Council.
55,00:01:50.23,00:01:50.23,   GERVASE: The most difficult thing for me
56,00:01:51.97,00:01:51.97,   was to vote somebody off.
57,00:01:53.20,00:01:53.20, JEFF:  And even though Ramona
58,00:01:54.87,00:01:54.87,"  had been working     harder than ever,"
59,00:01:56.10,00:01:56.10,  she was still voted off.
60,00:01:58.27,00:01:58.27,  Last vote: Ramona.
61,00:02:00.67,00:02:00.67, The tribe  has spoken.
62,00:02:02.50,00:02:02.50, 12 people left.
63,00:02:05.17,00:02:05.17,  Who will be voted off next?

65,00:02:13.87,00:02:13.87,  ( primal chanting )
66,00:03:06.43,00:03:06.43,   ( birds chirping )
67,00:03:16.90,00:03:16.90,   COLLEEN:  We slept late    for the first time
68,00:03:19.30,00:03:19.30, since we've been here today.
69,00:03:21.50,00:03:21.50,Everybody's a little bit on edge.
70,00:03:24.20,00:03:24.20,  Everybody's    a little vulnerable today.
71,00:03:26.13,00:03:26.13,  ( insects buzzing )
72,00:03:27.73,00:03:27.73, JOEL:  I think today   we're just a little bit down
73,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17," because another person's gone,    of course,"
74,00:03:32.23,00:03:32.23, and we can see that the group's getting
75,00:03:34.17,00:03:34.17, a little bit smaller.
76,00:03:35.43,00:03:35.43,"  Even if it's only two people smaller,"
77,00:03:37.23,00:03:37.23,  it's still getting   a little bit smaller
78,00:03:39.40,00:03:39.40,"  and, uh, and we're starting     to see that a little bit."
79,00:03:42.33,00:03:42.33,"JENNA:    For some reason,"
80,00:03:43.83,00:03:43.83,  the last two to three days   we've just been really down.
81,00:03:46.97,00:03:46.97,"  I think it's got a lot to do  with just, uh,"
82,00:03:49.17,00:03:49.17, we lost two in a row.
83,00:03:50.50,00:03:50.50, We lost a member of the group  and one of...
84,00:03:52.70,00:03:52.70," who I consider  one of our male leaders, Greg,"
85,00:03:55.10,00:03:55.10,  was really feeling terrible.
86,00:03:56.63,00:03:56.63,  He's got an ear infection.
87,00:03:58.53,00:03:58.53,  He's really sick.
88,00:04:04.40,00:04:04.40,   GRETCHEN:  I think the camp looks trashy.
89,00:04:06.50,00:04:06.50, I think stuff's    all over the place.
90,00:04:08.17,00:04:08.17, I think the flag should be up.
91,00:04:10.00,00:04:10.00," I mean,     there's a lot we could do"
92,00:04:11.67,00:04:11.67, to make    this camp look really nice.
93,00:04:13.77,00:04:13.77,"   I mean, something's going    to have to change."
94,00:04:15.17,00:04:15.17,   Something's going to have    to happen
95,00:04:17.00,00:04:17.00,  to make everybody decide   to pitch in.
96,00:04:35.43,00:04:35.43,"Welcome to the big top,  ladies and gentlemen."
97,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80, RUDY:  That is the parachute
98,00:04:40.37,00:04:40.37,  that they dropped   the cargo with the other day
99,00:04:42.87,00:04:42.87,"  that, uh,  contained some goodies"
100,00:04:44.40,00:04:44.40," and, uh, right now, they want"
101,00:04:46.83,00:04:46.83,to hang the parachute up    for shade.
102,00:05:03.70,00:05:03.70,"KELLY:  Me, personally,     I was a little irritated"
103,00:05:07.07,00:05:07.07,"with, um, Sean and Dirk's effort   around camp."
104,00:05:09.47,00:05:09.47,"I mean,"
105,00:05:10.47,00:05:10.47, they try to go fishing
106,00:05:12.03,00:05:12.03, when they know they're    not going to catch anything
107,00:05:13.90,00:05:13.90,"  and I think, personally,    it's just so they can say,"
108,00:05:16.00,00:05:16.00," ""Hey, well, we did something."""
109,00:05:17.63,00:05:17.63,   Kelly thinks that failure to catch fish is failure to try.
110,00:05:20.00,00:05:20.00,"You know, I think she's equating  those two, which is not true."
111,00:05:22.97,00:05:22.97,Right now we could be working...
112,00:05:24.77,00:05:24.77,driving through rush hour traffic.
113,00:05:26.80,00:05:26.80,Yep.
114,00:05:27.83,00:05:27.83,Fighting bills
115,00:05:28.87,00:05:28.87,and trying to get dates.
116,00:05:30.20,00:05:30.20,Instead we're just chilling on the South China sea.
117,00:05:32.40,00:05:32.40, SEAN:  The fish are not biting hooks out here for some reason.
118,00:05:35.17,00:05:35.17,"Either we got the wrong bait, or  we're going at the wrong time."
119,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37," Fishing with a hook, I think,   is useless."
120,00:05:40.03,00:05:40.03,  They put about 25 hours in
121,00:05:42.40,00:05:42.40, and not a bite.
122,00:05:45.37,00:05:45.37,That's a big enough hint for me not to go fishing with a hook.
123,00:05:48.73,00:05:48.73,You guys getting anything?
124,00:05:50.23,00:05:50.23,SEAN: Not even a nibble.
125,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,"   It's our    day off, brother."
126,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57, SUSAN:   I'm just irritated    with Sean and Dirk
127,00:05:56.57,00:05:56.57, going out and wasting    three days
128,00:05:57.97,00:05:57.97,in the daylight fishing.
129,00:05:59.23,00:05:59.23,"  And I let them know, too."
130,00:06:02.37,00:06:02.37,"   During the day, you should   go out in the woods"
131,00:06:04.27,00:06:04.27,  looking for tapioca
132,00:06:05.33,00:06:05.33,and fish at night.
133,00:06:06.67,00:06:06.67,You guys wasted
134,00:06:08.03,00:06:08.03,   three days fishing during the day.
135,00:06:09.47,00:06:09.47, DIRK:  I don't think  it was a waste.
136,00:06:11.70,00:06:11.70,"  Well, did you catch    anything?"
137,00:06:12.87,00:06:12.87,"  No, ma'am."
138,00:06:13.87,00:06:13.87, Okay.
139,00:06:17.27,00:06:17.27,  It was a waste of time then.
140,00:06:21.77,00:06:21.77, SEAN:  It's expected to get on   each other's nerves.
141,00:06:24.33,00:06:24.33,"  Maybe everyone's    on my nerves, too,"
142,00:06:25.80,00:06:25.80,  but I just  don't really act on it.
143,00:06:26.83,00:06:26.83,  I just wanted to be happy--
144,00:06:28.27,00:06:28.27, have a nice life here  and that's it.
145,00:06:31.60,00:06:31.60, KELLY: It's been the people who really    work and contribute to camp
146,00:06:35.23,00:06:35.23,   versus the people   who are lazy
147,00:06:36.83,00:06:36.83, and don't really do anything
148,00:06:38.57,00:06:38.57,  to contribute to the camp.
149,00:06:41.30,00:06:41.30,  The second I stop having fun
150,00:06:42.80,00:06:42.80,I'll vote myself off the island.
151,00:06:44.77,00:06:44.77,"  I came here   to have a great time,"
152,00:06:46.43,00:06:46.43,  grow in my faith
153,00:06:47.43,00:06:47.43, with the Lord
154,00:06:48.87,00:06:48.87, and that's the most important   thing to me.
155,00:06:50.90,00:06:50.90, RUDY:   It's funny to me that a guy  would read the Bible out here.
156,00:06:54.70,00:06:54.70,The only reason    I'd bring a Bible is if...
157,00:06:57.43,00:06:57.43,"  I mean, I'm religious too..."
158,00:06:59.47,00:06:59.47,   if I needed toilet paper.
159,00:07:19.10,00:07:19.10,"  Come on over, guys."
160,00:07:22.57,00:07:22.57,  I bring news of tomorrow's challenge.
161,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,  Right here.
162,00:07:26.27,00:07:26.27," ""First Annual"

164,00:07:29.73,00:07:29.73,"The battle in Borneo."""
165,00:07:31.40,00:07:31.40,"Now, it's a reward challenge,"
166,00:07:33.47,00:07:33.47,so you'll be competing against the other tribe
167,00:07:36.23,00:07:36.23,for something I have a feeling you all want-- food.
168,00:07:38.80,00:07:38.80,So here's the deal.
169,00:07:40.23,00:07:40.23, It'll be three rounds.
170,00:07:42.47,00:07:42.47,First round is a blowgun.
171,00:07:45.40,00:07:45.40,  Five darts.
172,00:07:46.77,00:07:46.77, Second round--    a mighty slingshot
173,00:07:50.40,00:07:50.40,"  and the third round,  spear tossing."
174,00:07:52.73,00:07:52.73,   So you'll pick one person for each event.
175,00:07:54.77,00:07:54.77,  So only three people    will participate.
176,00:07:56.33,00:07:56.33, And I'm coming to bring these   so you can practice.
177,00:07:58.70,00:07:58.70,Yeah!
178,00:07:58.70,00:07:58.70,I love it.
179,00:08:06.57,00:08:06.57, SEAN:  We had a little visit
180,00:08:09.23,00:08:09.23,"  from Jeff, our host, today,"
181,00:08:11.13,00:08:11.13,   and he came by and told us  that tomorrow's going
182,00:08:13.10,00:08:13.10, to be a competition--   a reward challenge.
183,00:08:15.00,00:08:15.00,  So we've been practicing     all day at that.
184,00:08:18.93,00:08:18.93,  ( laughing )
185,00:08:21.03,00:08:21.03,  ( cheering )
186,00:08:22.03,00:08:22.03,Right in the coconut.
187,00:08:26.60,00:08:26.60,  That wasn't too bad.
188,00:08:27.63,00:08:27.63, Turns out that I'm pretty good
189,00:08:29.33,00:08:29.33,   with the blowgun.  And I never really...
190,00:08:31.17,00:08:31.17,  never shot a blowgun before   in my life.
191,00:08:37.17,00:08:37.17, Dead on. Good.
192,00:08:39.07,00:08:39.07,   Turns out Rich is   an expert marksman.
193,00:08:40.60,00:08:40.60,   Something we didn't know about him
194,00:08:41.83,00:08:41.83," until today, so, uh..."
195,00:08:42.83,00:08:42.83, He has excellent aim
196,00:08:43.83,00:08:43.83, when it comes to a slingshot.
197,00:08:45.57,00:08:45.57,  No worries.
198,00:08:50.33,00:08:50.33,"Yeah, I think he's slingshot boy."
199,00:08:52.67,00:08:52.67,   And Sue throws that spear
200,00:08:54.23,00:08:54.23,  much better than any    of the guys in our tribe.
201,00:08:56.70,00:08:56.70,  She's a wild woman  with the spear.
202,00:09:03.50,00:09:03.50,I always wanted to kill a pig with a javelin... with a spear.
203,00:09:07.13,00:09:07.13,And I was kind of hoping   that I'd be good at nothing
204,00:09:09.50,00:09:09.50," so that I could just, like, hang back"
205,00:09:11.03,00:09:11.03,and let the pressure go    on somebody else.
206,00:09:12.87,00:09:12.87,  Turns out I throw   the javelin the best.
207,00:09:21.13,00:09:21.13, I'm thinking the other team's    going to have a guy
208,00:09:24.07,00:09:24.07,  throwing the spear.
209,00:09:25.33,00:09:25.33,"So if there is,  there's a good chance"
210,00:09:27.23,00:09:27.23,that I can dog some guy on national TV.
211,00:09:31.33,00:09:31.33, Cool.
212,00:09:33.03,00:09:33.03,"   No matter who    they put up,    you got it."
213,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,  SUE:  Even if we lost
214,00:09:36.03,00:09:36.03," and I at least dogged the guy  in the spear throwing,"
215,00:09:38.07,00:09:38.07,they'd be happy.
216,00:09:50.93,00:09:50.93,"GERVASE: Next up, out of Green Bay,"
217,00:09:55.13,00:09:55.13,"weighing in at 2... excuse me,"
218,00:09:57.27,00:09:57.27,he lost 20 pounds. 180.
219,00:10:00.03,00:10:00.03,"   Big country    all-American,"
220,00:10:03.37,00:10:03.37,  the world's strongest man!
221,00:10:18.47,00:10:18.47,( quacking )
222,00:10:21.83,00:10:21.83,  I never really threw   a spear in my life.
223,00:10:23.83,00:10:23.83,"  Except, you know...    anything serious."
224,00:10:25.63,00:10:25.63,  It's kind of hard   to keep it straight.
225,00:10:31.40,00:10:31.40," That's a good distance,"
226,00:10:34.00,00:10:34.00,"  especially a little thing    like this,"
227,00:10:35.43,00:10:35.43, and you don't know if you can   take a running start
228,00:10:38.27,00:10:38.27,"  or how you should do it,     or what the thing is, so"
229,00:10:40.77,00:10:40.77,this looks like it's going to be   our weakest event for sure.
230,00:10:43.23,00:10:43.23, Because the other girls have  the blowguns down really well.
231,00:10:49.63,00:10:49.63,  The slingshot looks good.
232,00:10:53.87,00:10:53.87,  So it would be nice     to win it today.
233,00:10:55.87,00:10:55.87,"A lot of these reward challenges  we haven't really been after,"
234,00:10:58.60,00:10:58.60, but I think we're all really     determined for this one.
235,00:11:01.80,00:11:01.80,  Looks good.
236,00:11:03.30,00:11:03.30,  ( cheering )
237,00:11:22.83,00:11:22.83,"  Welcome to the First Annual   Survivor Weapons Challenge,"
238,00:11:25.80,00:11:25.80,otherwise known as The Battle in Borneo.
239,00:11:28.03,00:11:28.03,  It's three rounds--    first round is blow darts.
240,00:11:30.40,00:11:30.40, You guys have selected your blow dart shooters?
241,00:11:33.43,00:11:33.43,"   All right,   you guys'll have ten darts."
242,00:11:35.27,00:11:35.27,Go ahead and take your shot here.
243,00:11:37.07,00:11:37.07,"Tagi, over here;    Pagong over here to watch."
244,00:11:39.43,00:11:39.43,  Any of the fruit you   hit goes into a basket
245,00:11:41.20,00:11:41.20,  that we carry over
246,00:11:42.63,00:11:42.63,  to the next round.
247,00:11:48.47,00:11:48.47,  Chinese melon!
248,00:11:52.37,00:11:52.37,Yeah!
249,00:11:53.40,00:11:53.40,   Yeah!
250,00:11:54.40,00:11:54.40,  JEFF:   Last shot.
251,00:11:56.17,00:11:56.17,"Good round, guys."
252,00:11:58.17,00:11:58.17,Head over to the slingshot area.
253,00:11:59.90,00:11:59.90,I'll collect your fruit.
254,00:12:01.73,00:12:01.73,"Hey, good work, buddy."
255,00:12:04.17,00:12:04.17," JEFF:  All right, it's a time trial."
256,00:12:06.23,00:12:06.23,Let's have the two slingshotters come up.
257,00:12:08.40,00:12:08.40,"Come on, Gretchen!"
258,00:12:09.60,00:12:09.60,"  Come on, baby,   come on, now!"
259,00:12:11.13,00:12:11.13, JEFF:   Here are the rules  for this round:
260,00:12:13.03,00:12:13.03,"  If you knock the fruit off,"
261,00:12:14.47,00:12:14.47, if you break the vase
262,00:12:17.50,00:12:17.50, or if you embed a rock   in the fruit
263,00:12:19.10,00:12:19.10, it goes into the fruit basket.
264,00:12:20.57,00:12:20.57, You have two minutes
265,00:12:22.10,00:12:22.10,  to hit as many of the items    as you can.
266,00:12:29.60,00:12:29.60,  ( cheering )
267,00:12:32.30,00:12:32.30, Yeah!
268,00:12:40.00,00:12:40.00,"JEFF: All right, round three..."
269,00:12:42.90,00:12:42.90,"spear throwing,"
270,00:12:44.87,00:12:44.87,   and this is where    it gets very interesting.
271,00:12:46.87,00:12:46.87,This is a winner-take-all event.
272,00:12:48.93,00:12:48.93,The single spear that is closest
273,00:12:50.67,00:12:50.67,   to the bull's-eye  when it's over
274,00:12:52.50,00:12:52.50, gets the basket  of fruit
275,00:12:55.50,00:12:55.50,and a very special food source--  a mystery food source.
276,00:12:58.77,00:12:58.77,Who are your two spear throwers?
277,00:13:00.30,00:13:00.30,"Step up, mate."
278,00:13:02.60,00:13:02.60,  This box is    for shooters only.
279,00:13:04.80,00:13:04.80,You each get three tosses.
280,00:13:06.73,00:13:06.73,"Susan, you're up."
281,00:13:17.07,00:13:17.07,Good shot!
282,00:13:17.07,00:13:17.07,Nice shot!
283,00:13:19.07,00:13:19.07,"  Come on, Joel,   you can do it."
284,00:13:21.87,00:13:21.87,"  Come on, Joel."
285,00:13:34.40,00:13:34.40,( cheering )
286,00:13:34.40,00:13:34.40,"Nice, Joel!"
287,00:13:36.43,00:13:36.43,Good job!
288,00:13:38.17,00:13:38.17,   Good job!
289,00:13:39.97,00:13:39.97, This is our closest right now. Pagong.
290,00:13:52.10,00:13:52.10,Nice shot!
291,00:13:54.07,00:13:54.07,( all talking at once )
292,00:13:57.17,00:13:57.17,JEFF: Those are even right now.
293,00:13:58.53,00:13:58.53," Come on, Joel."
294,00:14:16.20,00:14:16.20,   ( loud cheering )
295,00:14:19.10,00:14:19.10,Nice!
296,00:14:21.73,00:14:21.73,We want fruit!
297,00:14:23.33,00:14:23.33,   New mark to beat.
298,00:14:26.50,00:14:26.50,"Come on, Sue."
299,00:14:29.70,00:14:29.70,"JEFF: Last shot, Susan. Got to get inside that mark."
300,00:14:47.50,00:14:47.50,Nice!
301,00:14:49.50,00:14:49.50,   ( groaning and cheering )
302,00:14:54.00,00:14:54.00,JEFF: Victory for Pagong.
303,00:14:55.43,00:14:55.43,"Pagong, over here."
304,00:14:56.67,00:14:56.67,Tagi...
305,00:14:57.77,00:14:57.77,stay on your mat.
306,00:14:59.83,00:14:59.83,"Nice job, guys-- you get all the fruit..."
307,00:15:01.93,00:15:01.93,   Yes! Yes!
308,00:15:02.93,00:15:02.93,And a very special
309,00:15:04.23,00:15:04.23, mystery food prize.
310,00:15:07.03,00:15:07.03,  Pizza?
311,00:15:07.03,00:15:07.03,  Apple?
312,00:15:08.97,00:15:08.97,"Oh, snickers bars!"
313,00:15:08.97,00:15:08.97,A chicken!
314,00:15:12.00,00:15:12.00,Are you kidding? Oh!
315,00:15:13.03,00:15:13.03,( laughing )
316,00:15:14.93,00:15:14.93,Yes!
317,00:15:14.93,00:15:14.93,Yeah!
318,00:15:17.33,00:15:17.33, Egg-laying chickens...
319,00:15:20.70,00:15:20.70,  and all the fruit-- congratulations.
320,00:15:22.43,00:15:22.43,"Tagi, sorry."
321,00:15:28.57,00:15:28.57, ( chickens clucking )
322,00:15:29.83,00:15:29.83,Don't let them go.
323,00:15:31.57,00:15:31.57," Yeah, that's going to happen."
324,00:15:34.80,00:15:34.80,  This is so awesome; we got chickens.
325,00:15:37.00,00:15:37.00,You guys going to name these chickens?
326,00:15:39.43,00:15:39.43,"   Breakfast,    lunch and dinner."
327,00:15:40.43,00:15:40.43,"  Breakfast, lunch and dinner."
328,00:15:52.53,00:15:52.53," JENNA:    I don't know what brought    us down, but it seems like"
329,00:15:55.27,00:15:55.27,  winning that challenge just brought everybody right back up.
330,00:15:59.60,00:15:59.60," I can't speak    for the rest of the tribe,"
331,00:16:01.67,00:16:01.67,  but I really wanted to win    'cause it was food.
332,00:16:04.00,00:16:04.00, I wanted to win that
333,00:16:05.63,00:16:05.63, more than any  of the other rewards thus far.
334,00:16:08.17,00:16:08.17,"   Unexpectedly, we came back with three live chickens"
335,00:16:10.53,00:16:10.53,which was absolutely wonderful.
336,00:16:12.23,00:16:12.23,Don't you dare.
337,00:16:14.33,00:16:14.33, Uh...
338,00:16:19.57,00:16:19.57, Whoo!
339,00:16:21.70,00:16:21.70,"JENNA: Aw, Gretchen!"
340,00:16:23.77,00:16:23.77,You're so mean.
341,00:16:25.27,00:16:25.27," Mean, my ass."
342,00:16:26.97,00:16:26.97,"  Well, we're going to see     if they produce any eggs,"
343,00:16:28.63,00:16:28.63,  but I'm really thinking     that we're going to wait
344,00:16:30.10,00:16:30.10, every other day    and eat a chicken.
345,00:16:32.07,00:16:32.07,   GRETCHEN:    They're not going    to be around long.
346,00:16:33.47,00:16:33.47,  Everybody's waiting   for them to lay eggs
347,00:16:35.13,00:16:35.13,  but I think  they're under a lot of stress
348,00:16:37.57,00:16:37.57,   and there's three of them   in that box
349,00:16:39.50,00:16:39.50,and so they have   a very short time to produce
350,00:16:41.67,00:16:41.67,  before they're slaughtered.
351,00:16:43.23,00:16:43.23,  You could make   a big omelet.
352,00:16:44.63,00:16:44.63,That or we could just make fried rice with it.
353,00:16:47.37,00:16:47.37," Oh, chicken fried rice?"
354,00:16:48.60,00:16:48.60,Chicken fried rice.
355,00:16:49.73,00:16:49.73,"  Oh, gross! Oh, my God!"
356,00:16:51.27,00:16:51.27,"JENNA: Sorry, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner."
357,00:16:57.73,00:16:57.73,GERVASE:   The fruit and the chickens     was just so huge
358,00:17:00.23,00:17:00.23,"to us, really, I mean..."
359,00:17:02.33,00:17:02.33,   I think that's the biggest  reward so far to date.
360,00:17:05.40,00:17:05.40,  Fresh fruit.
361,00:17:14.77,00:17:14.77,  Ooh!
362,00:17:16.17,00:17:16.17,  ( laughing )
363,00:17:17.33,00:17:17.33,( squeals )
364,00:17:18.60,00:17:18.60,( laughing )
365,00:17:20.37,00:17:20.37,GERVASE:  I think we were down   just because we lost.
366,00:17:22.67,00:17:22.67," I mean, no matter how   you look at it, losing hurts"
367,00:17:25.13,00:17:25.13,  and we had to vote   somebody off.
368,00:17:26.83,00:17:26.83,"   So we just had to get out  of that, and then, when we won"
369,00:17:30.20,00:17:30.20," the reward challenge, that was     our momentum right there."
370,00:17:47.63,00:17:47.63," SUSAN:    As far as losing   the challenge today,"
371,00:17:50.53,00:17:50.53,   I was a little irritated.
372,00:17:52.80,00:17:52.80,  Here's my dream come true.
373,00:17:54.50,00:17:54.50,  I can stomp a guy  on national television
374,00:17:56.67,00:17:56.67,  and I miss by two inches.
375,00:17:58.17,00:17:58.17,"  It was a bummer, but then"
376,00:17:59.77,00:17:59.77," when they pulled the chickens out, I started laughing."
377,00:18:02.47,00:18:02.47, Cutting off a chicken's head?
378,00:18:04.10,00:18:04.10," No, it's not what I would want  to do for food."
379,00:18:07.23,00:18:07.23, I can live without the chicken    right now.
380,00:18:08.53,00:18:08.53, So that was all right.
381,00:18:09.97,00:18:09.97,The other team won some  live chickens with some eggs.
382,00:18:12.93,00:18:12.93,  So we came back here
383,00:18:14.37,00:18:14.37, and I went spearfishing  and got us a nice eel.
384,00:18:16.40,00:18:16.40, That's the first eel.
385,00:18:18.50,00:18:18.50,"  If I'd seen others, I'd have gotten others."
386,00:18:21.80,00:18:21.80,"SUSAN: Oh, wow."
387,00:18:24.80,00:18:24.80,"It's all beautiful meat, the whole thing."
388,00:18:27.23,00:18:27.23," Nice job, Rich."
389,00:18:28.90,00:18:28.90,Is that pretty?
390,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17, It's so pretty.
391,00:18:31.53,00:18:31.53,That's a lot of meat.
392,00:18:31.53,00:18:31.53,"That's a lot of meat, there."
393,00:18:32.90,00:18:32.90,It's all meat.
394,00:18:34.00,00:18:34.00, Beats the hell  out of chicken.
395,00:18:35.87,00:18:35.87, KELLY:  I'd rather eat some eel    than some chicken.
396,00:18:37.53,00:18:37.53, At least we eat stuff     that we go out and catch
397,00:18:40.07,00:18:40.07,"  and look for ourselves, and  we don't have it handed to us."
398,00:19:10.87,00:19:10.87,It might be a little overcooked.
399,00:19:15.53,00:19:15.53,It's meat.
400,00:19:16.73,00:19:16.73,   It's meat.
401,00:19:18.20,00:19:18.20,RICHARD: Grab a piece.
402,00:19:20.23,00:19:20.23,SUSAN: Grab a piece and see if you can rip it apart.
403,00:19:23.00,00:19:23.00,That's what it's going to take.
404,00:19:24.57,00:19:24.57,"RICHARD: It's cartilaginous, so chew on it."
405,00:19:36.33,00:19:36.33, SEAN:  The eel was pretty horrible.
406,00:19:38.47,00:19:38.47," Uh, it wasn't any good   whatsoever."
407,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17, KELLY:    We thought it was     just going to be
408,00:19:43.47,00:19:43.47,"   you know, big, fat steaks  of meat, but it really wasn't."
409,00:19:46.27,00:19:46.27, RUDY:  I wouldn't go  after eel again
410,00:19:48.50,00:19:48.50,  if I had a choice--  I would have rather had
411,00:19:50.87,00:19:50.87,chicken without a doubt.
412,00:19:52.57,00:19:52.57, Wow. That's something.
413,00:20:07.00,00:20:07.00,   GRETCHEN:   My feelings
414,00:20:08.37,00:20:08.37, on who the leader is   has always been Greg.
415,00:20:10.80,00:20:10.80,  He's just really good at it.
416,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,I may be slipping into some sort of leadership position.
417,00:20:15.37,00:20:15.37,  I'm attempting to avoid it.
418,00:20:16.90,00:20:16.90,   I don't want to be the leader of anything.
419,00:20:18.67,00:20:18.67," I go play by myself, help out    the tribe as much as I can"
420,00:20:22.87,00:20:22.87, and try and recharge   my batteries
421,00:20:25.23,00:20:25.23, so I can be there fully    with them.
422,00:20:28.17,00:20:28.17,"He's really good   at living in the woods, too."
423,00:20:29.73,00:20:29.73,"I think, out of everybody here,"
424,00:20:31.43,00:20:31.43,  Greg's the most comfortable   in the woods.
425,00:20:37.23,00:20:37.23, GREG:    My psychological comfort   does not come
426,00:20:40.27,00:20:40.27, from sleeping with the group     in a hut.
427,00:20:42.00,00:20:42.00,"  In fact,   they kind of make me nervous,"
428,00:20:43.87,00:20:43.87,  'cause there are   a lot of people doing
429,00:20:45.43,00:20:45.43,  a lot of different things
430,00:20:47.47,00:20:47.47,  and it's a lot of energy   in a very small space
431,00:20:50.00,00:20:50.00,  while I'm trying to clear    my head of energy.
432,00:20:52.13,00:20:52.13, Sleeping in the forest  is comfortable
433,00:20:53.93,00:20:53.93, for me.
434,00:20:55.27,00:20:55.27,   I'm making  a little sleeping pad.
435,00:20:56.73,00:20:56.73," Sleeping pad, sleeping bag--  depending on how big it gets."
436,00:20:59.53,00:20:59.53,  I just used some bedding     of debris
437,00:21:01.53,00:21:01.53,  or whatever I can find--    palm or the leaves
438,00:21:03.83,00:21:03.83,  that are around--  and pile up a bunch of debris.
439,00:21:06.90,00:21:06.90,  It's all a nesting instinct.
440,00:21:08.40,00:21:08.40,"  As with everything,  make yourself a nest."
441,00:21:10.30,00:21:10.30,  I nest like a mama bird.
442,00:21:13.23,00:21:13.23, Papa bird-- more like   a papa bird than a mama bird.
443,00:21:16.80,00:21:16.80,"  A single...  like a bachelor bird, I guess."
444,00:21:20.87,00:21:20.87, Colleen has joined me  in the forest to sleep.
445,00:21:23.70,00:21:23.70," She apparently finds it    more comfortable, as well."
446,00:21:27.07,00:21:27.07,"   I mean, they go off a lot,   seems like together."
447,00:21:29.27,00:21:29.27," Like last night, for example,"
448,00:21:31.37,00:21:31.37," while everybody     was going to bed,"
449,00:21:33.30,00:21:33.30," they got out,    and nobody saw them"
450,00:21:35.63,00:21:35.63, till just this morning     sometime.
451,00:21:42.03,00:21:42.03, JENNA:   I noticed they seem    to be spending their nights
452,00:21:45.23,00:21:45.23,  out under the stars     and cuddling up.
453,00:21:47.20,00:21:47.20,I think it's stepped up    a notch--
454,00:21:49.33,00:21:49.33,maybe a little romance going on.
455,00:21:51.67,00:21:51.67,"  Um, when we go off,   it's all about sex."
456,00:21:54.27,00:21:54.27,   It's all that's happening.
457,00:21:55.90,00:21:55.90, Um...
458,00:21:57.53,00:21:57.53,  it's a really passionate     affair right now.
459,00:21:59.53,00:21:59.53,Things are going great.
460,00:22:01.33,00:22:01.33,  ( laughing )
461,00:22:02.33,00:22:02.33, The question was asked before
462,00:22:04.67,00:22:04.67,"whether this was   a romantic situation or not,"
463,00:22:08.00,00:22:08.00,  and I will reaffirm     that there is no romance.
464,00:22:10.80,00:22:10.80,"   COLLEEN:   You know,"
465,00:22:12.20,00:22:12.20,"  he reminds me of my friends back home, so it's like"
466,00:22:14.77,00:22:14.77," I can totally, totally    be myself with him."
467,00:22:17.13,00:22:17.13, GREG:  So we like to play together--
468,00:22:19.13,00:22:19.13," not as a romantic situation,     but, yeah"
469,00:22:21.07,00:22:21.07, heading back out in the forest  and sleeping out there
470,00:22:24.23,00:22:24.23, and the rest of it is great.
471,00:22:36.87,00:22:36.87,RICHARD:  This is a yellow-banded    sea crate.
472,00:22:39.77,00:22:39.77,  We find a number of them  in the jungle.
473,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,  I haven't seen one  down here on the beach.
474,00:22:44.17,00:22:44.17,  I'm hoping    he goes for a swim.
475,00:22:46.27,00:22:46.27,  I might help him.
476,00:22:50.27,00:22:50.27, He's awake now.
477,00:22:52.30,00:22:52.30,"   Oh, I'm not    afraid of snakes."
478,00:22:54.13,00:22:54.13,"I mean,    I don't want to be bitten"
479,00:22:55.90,00:22:55.90,"  by something that's deadly, but, no, I used to play"
480,00:22:58.37,00:22:58.37,"  with garter snakes, when I was a kid"
481,00:22:59.80,00:22:59.80,"  and feed them frogs, and..."
482,00:23:01.43,00:23:01.43,"  You know, they're not..."
483,00:23:03.13,00:23:03.13,"  They are quick, and it's...    they can move fast,"
484,00:23:05.10,00:23:05.10, but you can see    when he's about to coil up
485,00:23:07.10,00:23:07.10,  and strike   and you can prepare yourself
486,00:23:08.93,00:23:08.93, and you can get ready to move  before it does.
487,00:23:13.10,00:23:13.10, I want to put him in the water 'cause I want to watch him swim.
488,00:23:24.60,00:23:24.60, We've been told
489,00:23:26.03,00:23:26.03,  they're extremely deadly--
490,00:23:28.67,00:23:28.67,"  immediately deadly,     within six hours deadly."
491,00:23:33.77,00:23:33.77,Horseflies bother me more.
492,00:23:44.13,00:23:44.13, SEAN:  I knew today was going to be    a good day when I woke up.
493,00:23:47.20,00:23:47.20, I haven't had a bowel movement   in nearly two weeks.
494,00:23:49.87,00:23:49.87,"  This morning, I had my first bowel movement-- felt fantastic."
495,00:23:53.00,00:23:53.00,  ( cheering )
496,00:23:54.27,00:23:54.27,I am one of the bowel movers now.
497,00:23:56.93,00:23:56.93,  I'm getting thinner   and thinner.
498,00:23:58.47,00:23:58.47,  I think I'm using  most of the rice I make
499,00:24:00.30,00:24:00.30, 'cause I'm not bloated
500,00:24:02.10,00:24:02.10, and my pants   are getting skinnier.
501,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17, Very excited about it--   it's the way
502,00:24:05.70,00:24:05.70," to start the day off, with a little bit of a bowel movement."
503,00:24:08.53,00:24:08.53,"Nice work, Sean."
504,00:24:09.83,00:24:09.83,"   Go, New York, go."
505,00:24:19.37,00:24:19.37," We were concerned about Dirk   and his eating a while ago,"
506,00:24:22.53,00:24:22.53, because he was really    disappearing into nothing.
507,00:24:25.37,00:24:25.37,"   We're all losing a little  bit of weight,"
508,00:24:26.90,00:24:26.90,   but Dirk was really losing a lot of weight.
509,00:24:31.20,00:24:31.20," DIRK:    I definitely lost  a lot of mass,"
510,00:24:33.40,00:24:33.40," a lot of muscle mass,    a lot of strength."
511,00:24:35.43,00:24:35.43,  It's not going to help me
512,00:24:37.10,00:24:37.10,"   but, as long as I conserve   my energy--"
513,00:24:39.37,00:24:39.37,don't waste it on things   that we don't need--
514,00:24:41.93,00:24:41.93," as long as I'm smart about it,  I think I'll be okay."
515,00:24:45.17,00:24:45.17, KELLY:   We've noticed Dirk kind of
516,00:24:48.73,00:24:48.73,getting a little skinny.
517,00:24:50.10,00:24:50.10,"Um, there was a few days"
518,00:24:51.67,00:24:51.67,   where we were all   kind of concerned about him
519,00:24:53.67,00:24:53.67,"and, uh, he was just kind of..."
520,00:24:56.43,00:24:56.43," I think, you know, mentally,    he was a little bummed out"
521,00:24:59.93,00:24:59.93,"   and all of us were, like, ""eat more rice, eat more rice."""
522,00:25:02.97,00:25:02.97, DIRK:  We're going on  a tapioca hunt.
523,00:25:05.27,00:25:05.27,"   That way, you can eat more, Dirk,"
524,00:25:07.23,00:25:07.23,'cause you're looking like hell.
525,00:25:09.23,00:25:09.23,"You look like a nazi war   prisoner camp, dude."
526,00:25:11.63,00:25:11.63,  I don't look that bad.
527,00:25:12.63,00:25:12.63,"Yeah, you do."
528,00:25:13.73,00:25:13.73,Nazi war prisoner camp dude.
529,00:25:15.17,00:25:15.17,Your Adam's apple's about out to the bottom of your chin.
530,00:25:17.27,00:25:17.27,It usually is anyway.
531,00:25:17.27,00:25:17.27,"Yeah. Hell, my arm's"
532,00:25:19.53,00:25:19.53,  as big as yours now.
533,00:25:21.03,00:25:21.03,  But it was before.
534,00:25:22.83,00:25:22.83,"  Well, we all kind of try     and keep an eye on him,"
535,00:25:24.97,00:25:24.97,   'cause he was real skinny  to begin with.
536,00:25:26.93,00:25:26.93, I'm doing the dishes;  I'm going out.
537,00:25:28.70,00:25:28.70,We got that.
538,00:25:29.90,00:25:29.90, Anybody else?
539,00:25:31.83,00:25:31.83," KELLY:    The labor thing,     it's actually better now."
540,00:25:34.33,00:25:34.33, Sean and Dirk    started to realize
541,00:25:36.27,00:25:36.27,"  that they better, you know,  do something."
542,00:25:38.83,00:25:38.83,"Otherwise, they're out of here."
543,00:25:40.53,00:25:40.53,Want me to peel one of the big ones
544,00:25:41.80,00:25:41.80,when you guys are done?
545,00:25:42.97,00:25:42.97,Yeah.
546,00:25:42.97,00:25:42.97,Is there another knife?
547,00:25:44.87,00:25:44.87," SUSAN:   They've kind of come around     the last couple,"
548,00:25:46.80,00:25:46.80," two, three days     and started doing"
549,00:25:48.47,00:25:48.47,"a little more, but it's   a little too late for that."
550,00:25:51.47,00:25:51.47, Maybe I am on thin ice   with this team now.
551,00:25:53.77,00:25:53.77, I don't know.
552,00:25:55.13,00:25:55.13,  I feel like   I'm pulling my weight
553,00:25:57.23,00:25:57.23,  and I think    the group sees that
554,00:25:58.80,00:25:58.80,"  and I'm just going to find    tapioca, and I'm just going"
555,00:26:01.20,00:26:01.20,   to let it work itself out.
556,00:26:02.37,00:26:02.37,Where you going? For tapioca?
557,00:26:03.70,00:26:03.70,SEAN: Yeah.
558,00:26:05.17,00:26:05.17,"KELLY: You know what the, uh, roots look like."
559,00:26:07.23,00:26:07.23,"Yeah, yeah, I just showed Dirk."
560,00:26:08.60,00:26:08.60,SUSAN: And you know
561,00:26:09.60,00:26:09.60, what the trunks  look like.
562,00:26:10.90,00:26:10.90,"Yeah. No, I just showed him the thing by the raft."
563,00:26:13.07,00:26:13.07,"RICHARD:   Kelly, Sue and I--"
564,00:26:14.63,00:26:14.63, we need to decide cohesively     who we're going to reject
565,00:26:17.33,00:26:17.33,"and it's between Sean and Dirk,    and Sean--"
566,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,"yesterday, he was talking about how he doesn't want"
567,00:26:22.90,00:26:22.90,to form an alliance because...
568,00:26:24.47,00:26:24.47,Yeah.
569,00:26:25.50,00:26:25.50,"You know, ""do unto others"" and..."
570,00:26:27.17,00:26:27.17,What? You're in the midst of a game.
571,00:26:27.17,00:26:27.17,"""...as others do unto you."""
572,00:26:29.60,00:26:29.60,  It's just a game;   this is not real life.
573,00:26:31.03,00:26:31.03,"So, we're thinking, ""boy, Sean, it's time for you to go, bud."""
574,00:26:43.73,00:26:43.73,"  Tapioca's good eating, too."
575,00:26:45.17,00:26:45.17,We definitely want a lot of it.
576,00:26:46.97,00:26:46.97,  I don't even know if I know  what I'm looking for.
577,00:26:49.20,00:26:49.20,   It's a distinctive  reddish root.
578,00:26:51.07,00:26:51.07,  Will I know when I find it?
579,00:26:53.07,00:26:53.07,"   If we look further along the trail,"
580,00:26:55.20,00:26:55.20, maybe we'll have better luck.
581,00:26:57.37,00:26:57.37," I can't find any tapioca, man."
582,00:26:59.83,00:26:59.83,   I don't know where it is.
583,00:27:01.93,00:27:01.93,SEAN: Hermit crab crawling through the jungle.
584,00:27:05.43,00:27:05.43,Look at the claws on that thing.
585,00:27:07.43,00:27:07.43,   They do make them big    here in the jungle.
586,00:27:09.37,00:27:09.37, What about the tapioca?
587,00:27:11.00,00:27:11.00,   They make any tapioca    big in this jungle?
588,00:27:12.53,00:27:12.53,Not really.
589,00:27:14.10,00:27:14.10,  We still ain't   found any.
590,00:27:16.27,00:27:16.27,  We're sucking at   this jungle thing.
591,00:27:21.63,00:27:21.63, SEAN:  There was about five   on this stem that I picked up
592,00:27:24.63,00:27:24.63, but only one was good.
593,00:27:25.93,00:27:25.93,  The rest were mushy.
594,00:27:27.60,00:27:27.60,So I had to throw the rest away.
595,00:27:30.67,00:27:30.67,  It wasn't a   complete loss.
596,00:27:32.30,00:27:32.30,   I think that we've    exhausted our supply.
597,00:27:34.10,00:27:34.10,"So that's the end of the tapioca, then?"
598,00:27:36.43,00:27:36.43,"I think. I mean,    you guys have better luck."

601,00:27:44.30,00:27:44.30,Yep.
602,00:27:45.30,00:27:45.30,"Maybe it's you and me, man."
603,00:27:46.83,00:27:46.83, Maybe we're a bad team.
604,00:27:48.00,00:27:48.00,Probably.
605,00:27:49.27,00:27:49.27,"We're a fun team, though."
606,00:28:02.40,00:28:02.40,Got our message.

613,00:28:15.97,00:28:15.97, KELLY:  Today's day 15
614,00:28:18.00,00:28:18.00,  and we have   an Immunity Challenge today.
615,00:28:20.47,00:28:20.47,"Hopefully, um, it'll be  something that, uh..."
616,00:28:22.97,00:28:22.97,"that we can win pretty handily,   and I don't feel like going"
617,00:28:25.70,00:28:25.70, to the Immune Council tonight  by any means.
618,00:28:28.73,00:28:28.73,   I think we're    all swimming    except one rower.
619,00:28:30.70,00:28:30.70," Gervase can't  swim, and he's  kind of gangly,"
620,00:28:33.47,00:28:33.47,  so I don't picture him   rowing all that well.
621,00:28:36.07,00:28:36.07,   I don't know.    Maybe he can.
622,00:28:37.50,00:28:37.50,I think we certainly have an edge up.
623,00:28:40.27,00:28:40.27," Apparently, we need one rower  and the rest of us swimming,"
624,00:28:42.80,00:28:42.80," which is good, because we have   Kelly who's a rower."
625,00:28:45.47,00:28:45.47, That's what she does   as a profession for a living.
626,00:28:47.87,00:28:47.87,"So it's your turn to shine, Kel."
627,00:28:49.47,00:28:49.47,"Oh, boy. This is it."
628,00:28:50.47,00:28:50.47,You've been waiting for this.
629,00:28:52.10,00:28:52.10,   Your time    to shine.
630,00:28:53.80,00:28:53.80," KELLY:    I'm a commercial  white-water raft guide,"
631,00:28:56.77,00:28:56.77," so obviously,   I'm the rower today."
632,00:29:00.47,00:29:00.47," Feeling a little pressure, but  I'm not too worried about it."
633,00:29:04.63,00:29:04.63,"  I know Gervase can't swim,    so my guess"
634,00:29:08.23,00:29:08.23,"is that they're going to put him   in the boat rowing,"
635,00:29:11.70,00:29:11.70,  which is cool for me
636,00:29:13.17,00:29:13.17, because I can beat him   any day of the week.
637,00:29:21.20,00:29:21.20,"GERVASE:  ""Selecting one     is always a chore"
638,00:29:24.47,00:29:24.47,"""so check your ego at the door."

641,00:29:31.80,00:29:31.80,  The decision that is obvious   is that Gervase should row.
642,00:29:35.30,00:29:35.30, JENNA:   You can look at it     as a disadvantage
643,00:29:36.93,00:29:36.93,  that Gervase can't swim.
644,00:29:38.53,00:29:38.53,  But we all are going to have our differences.
645,00:29:42.87,00:29:42.87,Not all of us are going   to be strong at everything.
646,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,Wow.
647,00:29:47.37,00:29:47.37,  Swimming and rowing.
648,00:29:49.27,00:29:49.27,I sent Gervase to row so he doesn't have to swim.
649,00:29:51.67,00:29:51.67,But they'll guess that.
650,00:29:53.03,00:29:53.03,   They'll know that that's what we're doing.
651,00:29:54.30,00:29:54.30,"Yeah, but I mean, what other choice do we have?"
652,00:29:56.30,00:29:56.30,We might not even get a life preserver.

658,00:30:09.17,00:30:09.17,"To me, I'll sink  like I was in a pool."
659,00:30:11.37,00:30:11.37,Maybe we have to build something
660,00:30:12.97,00:30:12.97,  and the people who swim have to push it and one guy rows it.

675,00:30:54.80,00:30:54.80, Five members   from each tribe are stranded

679,00:31:05.13,00:31:05.13, the members of their own tribe    by using outrigger canoes.
680,00:31:09.70,00:31:09.70,  Kelly was chosen  to row by Tagi
681,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,  and Gervase   was chosen by Pagong.
682,00:31:16.47,00:31:16.47,  Here's the premise.
683,00:31:17.83,00:31:17.83, It's all on you guys.
684,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,You're each going to be in one of these canoes.
685,00:31:21.23,00:31:21.23,You're going to swim out

687,00:31:24.70,00:31:24.70,yellow and orange.
688,00:31:25.83,00:31:25.83,Once you go on the outside
689,00:31:27.57,00:31:27.57,"  of the buoy,  you start heading back"
690,00:31:29.50,00:31:29.50,and you start picking up  tribe members.
691,00:31:31.57,00:31:31.57,"Once they are on board, though,"
692,00:31:33.60,00:31:33.60,   they can start helping you  with paddles.
693,00:31:36.10,00:31:36.10,"   You've got three paddles,    and you've got one bailer,"
694,00:31:38.80,00:31:38.80,"   'cause you    will take on water today,"
695,00:31:40.60,00:31:40.60,as rough as it is.

700,00:31:50.40,00:31:50.40, Why are you the rower?

702,00:31:53.93,00:31:53.93," so this is my element   right here,"
703,00:31:56.30,00:31:56.30,so there was no choice.

707,00:32:04.13,00:32:04.13,  Are you rowing   because you'd
708,00:32:05.53,00:32:05.53,  rather row   than swim?
709,00:32:06.77,00:32:06.77,"I think that's what we were thinking at first,"
710,00:32:10.00,00:32:10.00, but I knew it would be something kind of tricky
711,00:32:12.67,00:32:12.67,"  and it's show time, so I like the spotlight."
712,00:32:15.27,00:32:15.27,Really? Lot of pressure.
713,00:32:17.10,00:32:17.10,Pressure's good.

743,00:35:05.77,00:35:05.77, Yeah.

761,00:36:11.60,00:36:11.60,Absolutely.
762,00:36:12.63,00:36:12.63,I say that to myself all the time.

776,00:36:39.63,00:36:39.63,  and I've had a strategy from day one.
777,00:36:41.60,00:36:41.60,I've already built an alliance and we're going to work through

790,00:37:08.83,00:37:08.83, I think I'll be here tomorrow.

792,00:37:50.23,00:37:50.23, What's to say?
793,00:37:51.70,00:37:51.70,Tribal council.
794,00:37:53.37,00:37:53.37,"Tough situation. Kelly, tell me about morale."
795,00:37:55.73,00:37:55.73, Two tough losses back-to-back.
796,00:37:58.47,00:37:58.47,"  Personally, for me,  today was really hard."
797,00:38:03.60,00:38:03.60," Um... coulda, shoulda, woulda    a lot of things, you know?"
798,00:38:07.67,00:38:07.67,   I said some things    at the beach... whatever.
799,00:38:10.43,00:38:10.43," I'm not making excuses,"
800,00:38:12.00,00:38:12.00," not trying to,  not going to, you know?"
801,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53,"I gave it my best today and just wasn't good enough,"
802,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,"   so ate a little crow,    it's all right."
803,00:38:20.27,00:38:20.27,Doesn't mean I have to like it.
804,00:38:22.40,00:38:22.40," Sean, your role here?"
805,00:38:24.30,00:38:24.30,Very nebulous.
806,00:38:25.90,00:38:25.90,  I don't know   what I'm doing here.
807,00:38:27.77,00:38:27.77,  After how long we been here?
808,00:38:29.57,00:38:29.57,"  15, 16 days."
809,00:38:30.57,00:38:30.57,I still haven't found my niche.
810,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,I'm just here to have fun.
811,00:38:34.53,00:38:34.53,  I'll take it as far   as I can go
812,00:38:36.07,00:38:36.07,   till you throw me kicking  and screaming off this island.
813,00:38:38.93,00:38:38.93,Yeah?
814,00:38:38.93,00:38:38.93,Dirk?
815,00:38:40.27,00:38:40.27,   It seems like    I've noticed
816,00:38:41.43,00:38:41.43,you spending more time alone.
817,00:38:43.43,00:38:43.43,   How much of that time    do you spend thinking
818,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,  about how effective you are    at fitting in this group?
819,00:38:49.73,00:38:49.73,I'd say very little.
820,00:38:51.37,00:38:51.37,"I can't think myself into being    more effective, you know?"
821,00:38:54.00,00:38:54.00,   I'm working hard.
822,00:38:55.00,00:38:55.00,   I'm catching fish
823,00:38:56.17,00:38:56.17,and I've been completely  unsuccessful.
824,00:38:58.13,00:38:58.13,I'm working hard    at hunting tapioca
825,00:38:59.50,00:38:59.50,and I've been completely  unsuccessful.
826,00:39:00.60,00:39:00.60,I've been working ha...
827,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,"You know, it's like I've failed    at everything I've tried,"
828,00:39:04.13,00:39:04.13,"   but it's not like the effort's not there,"
829,00:39:05.77,00:39:05.77,you know what I'm saying?
830,00:39:07.60,00:39:07.60,"Yeah, man."
831,00:39:07.60,00:39:07.60,Richard?
832,00:39:09.17,00:39:09.17," 15 days now together,"
833,00:39:10.63,00:39:10.63,"inevitable that certain alliances, even within a group,"
834,00:39:14.77,00:39:14.77, smaller factions begin   to develop.
835,00:39:16.57,00:39:16.57, Have you guys  reached a point now
836,00:39:18.10,00:39:18.10, where you have  this tight unit
837,00:39:19.63,00:39:19.63,that these alliances are going to come in to play in the vote?
838,00:39:22.53,00:39:22.53,"  The alliances that you talk  about, the Rudy and I"
839,00:39:25.97,00:39:25.97," and the Sean and Dirk kind of hanging,"
840,00:39:28.43,00:39:28.43,"and the Sue and Kelly together, are almost kind of little teams"
841,00:39:33.00,00:39:33.00,   within a team doing things
842,00:39:34.80,00:39:34.80,'cause it usually takes a couple of people to do things.
843,00:39:38.57,00:39:38.57,  I think a bigger alliance is what all six of us have created
844,00:39:43.93,00:39:43.93, so I don't think that the smaller ones detract
845,00:39:47.53,00:39:47.53, from how we feel about  the six of...
846,00:39:51.07,00:39:51.07,  all of us together.
847,00:39:53.07,00:39:53.07,   It's time to vote.
848,00:39:54.37,00:39:54.37, Dirk.
849,00:40:11.53,00:40:11.53,"  I love you, but I just can't  stand the complaining."
850,00:40:34.17,00:40:34.17,"  For the first time,   I'm voting for Rudy,"
851,00:40:36.27,00:40:36.27,  only because this is
852,00:40:37.57,00:40:37.57,probably an athletic competition    coming up
853,00:40:39.47,00:40:39.47,that we're going  to have to win
854,00:40:41.30,00:40:41.30,   and that's the only reason I would cast a vote against him.
855,00:40:46.37,00:40:46.37,   He's a phenomenal person.
856,00:41:03.13,00:41:03.13,  Fire represents life  on the island.
857,00:41:05.10,00:41:05.10, Your torches represent   your identity here.
858,00:41:07.37,00:41:07.37,  Directly across from you are
859,00:41:09.07,00:41:09.07,  four torches that represent  the first four people
860,00:41:12.13,00:41:12.13,  that have been voted off the island.
861,00:41:14.30,00:41:14.30," Tonight, a fifth torch   will be added to that group."
862,00:41:18.23,00:41:18.23,I'll go tally the votes.
863,00:41:38.47,00:41:38.47,"   Before I read the votes,    I just want to remind you"
864,00:41:40.83,00:41:40.83," once they're tallied,  the decision is final"
865,00:41:43.00,00:41:43.00,  and the person must  leave the island immediately.
866,00:41:45.60,00:41:45.60,  I'll read   the votes.
867,00:41:52.37,00:41:52.37, First vote...

871,00:42:16.97,00:42:16.97," ""Dirk."""
872,00:42:18.90,00:42:18.90, That's two  votes for Dirk.

874,00:42:29.03,00:42:29.03, That's three votes.
875,00:42:30.40,00:42:30.40,  We don't need to   read the last one.
876,00:42:46.37,00:42:46.37, The tribe  has spoken.
877,00:42:52.53,00:42:52.53,   It's time for    you to go.
878,00:42:53.53,00:42:53.53,All right.
879,00:42:54.60,00:42:54.60,Good-bye.
880,00:42:54.60,00:42:54.60,"Guys, good luck."
881,00:43:11.43,00:43:11.43,   You can take your torches  and head back to camp.
882,00:43:14.20,00:43:14.20,  Good night.
