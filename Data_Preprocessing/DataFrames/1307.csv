5,00:00:16.79,00:00:16.79,>> We play for our team. >> Right.
6,00:00:18.46,00:00:18.46,">> And when we're in the merge together, we keep an eye out for"
7,00:00:20.29,00:00:20.29,"each other, and that's going to be the difference between our"
8,00:00:22.33,00:00:22.33,culture verses others. >> PROBST: You'll see 14 scenes
9,00:00:26.96,00:00:26.96,of all-new footage. >> Let's get this party started.
10,00:00:31.08,00:00:31.08,"Keep it going, dog. >> Throw it."
11,00:00:35.46,00:00:35.46,">> Stefannie had about three swigs, and she's delirious."
12,00:00:39.21,00:00:39.21,">> Oh, yeah, hold her up. ( laughter )"
13,00:00:49.08,00:00:49.08,">> I mean, we're getting blown away from our island."
14,00:00:50.83,00:00:50.83,>> I know. I don't know what to do about
15,00:00:52.29,00:00:52.29,it. >> What is that?
16,00:00:55.62,00:00:55.62,>> I hope that's not them flipped over.
17,00:00:57.50,00:00:57.50,">> Oh, my god. >> PROBST: You'll see highlights"
18,00:01:03.08,00:01:03.08,from the first 18 days of this adventure.
19,00:01:06.83,00:01:06.83,>> Ah! >> No!
20,00:01:08.67,00:01:08.67,">> Ah, stop! I am so sorry."
21,00:01:15.21,00:01:15.21,>> I came here to play the game. That's my dream.
22,00:01:16.88,00:01:16.88,My prize isn't even the million dollars.
23,00:01:18.50,00:01:18.50,"My prize was I fell in love in this game, love at first sight."
24,00:01:25.79,00:01:25.79,">> Oh, my god. >> What?"
25,00:01:29.71,00:01:29.71,">> The little chick. >> Oh, man."
26,00:01:32.92,00:01:32.92,">> This thing is newborn, like today."
27,00:01:35.17,00:01:35.17,>> Wow. I am really sorry.
28,00:01:37.08,00:01:37.08,I mean it. >> PROBST: And we'll delve
29,00:01:40.58,00:01:40.58,deeper into Survivor's most controversial season ever.
30,00:01:44.12,00:01:44.12,>> This was a racially based set of tribes.
31,00:01:48.21,00:01:48.21,I think it'll be interesting to see if there really is cultural
32,00:01:50.54,00:01:50.54,"bias. You know, the Asian tribe,"
33,00:01:53.42,00:01:53.42,"they're not all from one country, per se, I'm assuming."
34,00:01:57.12,00:01:57.12,"And I'm a white guy, but I'm a white Jew."
35,00:02:01.54,00:02:01.54,>> You represent your race. It's not about avoiding.
36,00:02:04.46,00:02:04.46,It's always a wall. We can never let that wall down
37,00:02:08.04,00:02:08.04,to interact or be honest with others.
38,00:02:12.08,00:02:12.08,>> It's a little bit uncomfortable for me.
39,00:02:14.17,00:02:14.17,"It's like you're trying to change the world in 39 days, and"
40,00:02:16.38,00:02:16.38,that just made the game that much harder.
41,00:02:27.54,00:02:27.54,">> Watch it, watch it, watch it! >> PROBST: 18 days ago, 20"
42,00:02:30.38,00:02:30.38,Americans began the adventure of a lifetime.
43,00:02:35.12,00:02:35.12,They had just two minutes to gather everything they would
44,00:02:39.29,00:02:39.29,need for the next 39 days. 30 seconds!
45,00:02:48.75,00:02:48.75,>> The chicken! >> Forget about the chicken!
46,00:02:50.17,00:02:50.17,Let's go! >> Get overboard!
47,00:02:54.46,00:02:54.46,>> Paddle. >> Where's the Hawaiian sling?
48,00:02:58.46,00:02:58.46,>> The teams were actually devised by ethnicity.
49,00:03:02.21,00:03:02.21,You had a Latino team. You had an Asian team.
50,00:03:06.62,00:03:06.62,You had a Caucasian team. And then you had an African-
51,00:03:10.08,00:03:10.08,"American team. So I was like, ""Oh, snap, you"
52,00:03:12.75,00:03:12.75,"know, I'm not the only token brother for once."""
53,00:03:19.17,00:03:19.17,>> Ah! >> I personally feel like the
54,00:03:23.33,00:03:23.33,"division is kind of strange. Like, I've never been separated"
55,00:03:28.21,00:03:28.21,"because of my skin color before, and I don't really like it."
56,00:03:33.33,00:03:33.33,">> Row, row! >> The Asian invasion!"
57,00:03:40.17,00:03:40.17,">> I'm pretty, you know, as Americanized as you can get."
58,00:03:43.04,00:03:43.04,"At the same time, I mean, growing up, there were times"
59,00:03:45.33,00:03:45.33,when people would make presumptions about me or make
60,00:03:47.29,00:03:47.29,fun of me or insult me because of my ethnicity.
61,00:03:50.29,00:03:50.29,"I remember when I was a kid, every time we put up Christmas"
62,00:03:52.29,00:03:52.29,"lights, young kids would come by and smash our Christmas lights."
63,00:04:01.21,00:04:01.21,">> To me, being a Dominican American is just a conversation"
64,00:04:03.38,00:04:03.38,"piece. Because, like, being a"
65,00:04:06.54,00:04:06.54,"Dominican, what is that going to do for me out here?"
66,00:04:08.62,00:04:08.62,I think that means squat. I think the content of your
67,00:04:10.62,00:04:10.62,"character means everything. Building stuff, there should be"
68,00:04:14.42,00:04:14.42,"the shelter, plus I know how to make a toilet."
69,00:04:18.08,00:04:18.08,">> You want the machete? >> Well, no."
70,00:04:19.50,00:04:19.50,"First I'll just explain it to you, and then we'll all be,"
71,00:04:22.04,00:04:22.04,"like, on the same page. We'll all have the blueprint."
72,00:04:23.88,00:04:23.88,>> Do you want them with us? >> They're going to do the
73,00:04:25.83,00:04:25.83,leaves and stuff. They don't really need to hear
74,00:04:27.21,00:04:27.21,"all this part. >> PROBST: At Aitu, Billy"
75,00:04:29.38,00:04:29.38,quickly found himself on the outs...
76,00:04:33.92,00:04:33.92,>> It was kind of obvious to me that he didn't really know
77,00:04:36.67,00:04:36.67,exactly what he was doing. >> PROBST: ...forcing Ozzy to
78,00:04:40.25,00:04:40.25,"step up. >> Oh, my god."
79,00:04:44.25,00:04:44.25,">> I mean, he may not be very big, but he's an athlete, and"
80,00:04:46.79,00:04:46.79,he's somebody who'd be pretty good at this game.
81,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,>> Really good job. >> Good job.
82,00:04:53.08,00:04:53.08,>> PROBST: On Puka... >> You've got a touch of bad
83,00:04:54.88,00:04:54.88,wind. >> PROBST: ...Cao Boi resorted
84,00:04:56.38,00:04:56.38,"to some traditional healing. >> There, you'll feel better"
85,00:04:58.92,00:04:58.92,now. >> It looks like it's burned.
86,00:05:02.58,00:05:02.58,Does it hurt? >> I've never been accepted by
87,00:05:05.00,00:05:05.00,the Asian community. I just don't fit the stereotype.
88,00:05:09.08,00:05:09.08,It's a very dangerous position for me to be in.
89,00:05:12.08,00:05:12.08,">> You all know what this is, right?"
90,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,"Represent, represent, represent! >> Whoo!"
91,00:05:19.67,00:05:19.67,">> PROBST: At Hiki, Sekou quickly emerged as a natural"
92,00:05:22.21,00:05:22.21,"leader. >> Okay, everybody, focus, okay?"
93,00:05:25.12,00:05:25.12,Focus on what we're doing. >> Is it smoking?
94,00:05:29.46,00:05:29.46,">> Yeah. >> Come on, oh, yes!"
95,00:05:31.21,00:05:31.21,>> Yes! >> PROBST: And then almost as
96,00:05:33.75,00:05:33.75,quickly... >> I need a break.
97,00:05:35.58,00:05:35.58,>> PROBST: ...burned out. >> Want to do it?
98,00:05:37.92,00:05:37.92,>> Yeah. >> It's all for you.
99,00:05:40.33,00:05:40.33,">> Hey, y'all, look, a boat! Look!"
100,00:05:42.83,00:05:42.83,">> What? >> Yeah, we upgraded!"
101,00:05:45.42,00:05:45.42,">> PROBST: But as this never- before-seen footage shows, it"
102,00:05:47.92,00:05:47.92,wasn't just Sekou who lacked outdoor skills at Hiki.
103,00:05:52.17,00:05:52.17,>> Be careful. >> Look at all the water in our
104,00:06:01.38,00:06:01.38,"boat. >> You know, we thought we were"
105,00:06:03.08,00:06:03.08,"all canoe tight, like, ""Yeah, we're going to row this thing"
106,00:06:05.67,00:06:05.67,"out."" That was easier said than done."
107,00:06:11.46,00:06:11.46,">> Oh! >> Oh, no!"
108,00:06:14.25,00:06:14.25,>> I'm trying to hold it! >> We're a bunch of city kids.
109,00:06:17.33,00:06:17.33,"It's not that we are black, white, Asian, Latino."
110,00:06:20.50,00:06:20.50,It's not that. We're city kids.
111,00:06:23.38,00:06:23.38,We have one person who's from the South.
112,00:06:27.12,00:06:27.12,">> Oh, no! Oh, you okay?"
113,00:06:29.04,00:06:29.04,>> Yeah. >> It's harder than it looks.
114,00:06:31.08,00:06:31.08,>> You know paddling isn't our specialty.
115,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,">> No, the whole boat experience, rafts, boats,"
116,00:06:37.08,00:06:37.08,"anything on water that... >> I don't know everything, but"
117,00:06:47.96,00:06:47.96,I never got on a boat that did that.
118,00:06:52.25,00:06:52.25,>> I have no clue. >> So are you getting in the
119,00:07:02.17,00:07:02.17,front? >> It really doesn't matter to
120,00:07:03.62,00:07:03.62,me. I'll do it either way.
121,00:07:05.88,00:07:05.88,">> I'll be in the driver's seat. >> We're about to go out,"
122,00:07:08.46,00:07:08.46,"Candice and I, catch us some food."
123,00:07:11.71,00:07:11.71,"Ready? I'm dying for some protein, so"
124,00:07:15.04,00:07:15.04,hopefully we can catch some fish and get that.
125,00:07:17.08,00:07:17.08,Hopefully by the end of the day we'll have all that for us.
126,00:07:29.12,00:07:29.12,>> PROBST: Day two at Raro found Adam and Candice eager for an
127,00:07:31.12,00:07:31.12,adventure. >> PROBST: But when the weather
128,00:07:37.33,00:07:37.33,"turned, the adventure went south."
129,00:07:40.38,00:07:40.38,">> I mean, we're getting pulled away from our island."
130,00:07:43.38,00:07:43.38,>> I know. I don't know what to do about
131,00:07:45.08,00:07:45.08,it. Found a little sandbar here to
132,00:08:00.17,00:08:00.17,"hang out at, because every time we try to start paddling, the"
133,00:08:03.04,00:08:03.04,"current's so strong, it actually brings us straight back."
134,00:08:10.75,00:08:10.75,Cold? >> Yeah.
135,00:08:15.67,00:08:15.67,>> We'd been out there for hours.
136,00:08:17.25,00:08:17.25,We were exhausted. It was awful.
137,00:08:19.38,00:08:19.38,"I mean, we were shivering. My knees were shaking."
138,00:08:22.79,00:08:22.79,"My jaw was shivering. We were wet, and it's just the"
139,00:08:26.25,00:08:26.25,frustration wearing on you. It's the worst situation I've
140,00:08:29.12,00:08:29.12,"been in in a long, long time. I want to do something."
141,00:08:33.00,00:08:33.00,"I don't want to sit... >> Yeah, I don't think we can"
142,00:08:34.21,00:08:34.21,paddle it. I really don't.
143,00:08:36.96,00:08:36.96,">> You know, we're just going to have to sacrifice the boat."
144,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,>> What is that? >> I hope that's not them
145,00:08:43.96,00:08:43.96,"flipped over. >> Oh, my god."
146,00:08:49.21,00:08:49.21,">> I don't even see a boat. >> You know, with the wind and"
147,00:08:54.92,00:08:54.92,"the current, I mean, we were shivering, and we were freezing,"
148,00:08:58.08,00:08:58.08,and we were exhausted. It was awful.
149,00:09:01.04,00:09:01.04,But we finally made it back. >> Can you see the little speck
150,00:09:04.04,00:09:04.04,out there? >> That's our boat?
151,00:09:06.46,00:09:06.46,">> Yeah, I think so. >> Did it flip over?"
152,00:09:08.67,00:09:08.67,">> No. >> Wait, it's not flipped over"
153,00:09:10.17,00:09:10.17,"or anything? >> No, no."
154,00:09:11.83,00:09:11.83,It's anchored to the sandbar. >> You couldn't paddle it?
155,00:09:14.33,00:09:14.33,You guys were too tired? I was concerned about Candice
156,00:09:17.88,00:09:17.88,"and Adam, when they came back without the boat, and they're,"
157,00:09:20.75,00:09:20.75,"like, shivering and purple. And then after I got over my"
158,00:09:24.79,00:09:24.79,"initial concern, I'm concerned about the boat."
159,00:09:28.17,00:09:28.17,"We need that to go fishing. Like, we need food."
160,00:09:31.75,00:09:31.75,">> I just can't stand giving up, you know?"
161,00:09:33.54,00:09:33.54,">> Yeah, I know. >> Save the other leaves for"
162,00:09:44.33,00:09:44.33,when we make the tent for tomorrow.
163,00:09:47.04,00:09:47.04,>> Why do you say we need more cross bars?
164,00:09:48.42,00:09:48.42,">> Because when you look underneath, they're starting to"
165,00:09:50.04,00:09:50.04,bow. We probably just need one more.
166,00:09:52.12,00:09:52.12,">> Oh, okay, that's fine. >> All right."
167,00:09:53.67,00:09:53.67,>> There's a couple here. >> PROBST: While the Aitu tribe
168,00:09:55.12,00:09:55.12,"worked on their shelter, Billy, in this new footage, went to"
169,00:09:58.17,00:09:58.17,"work on Aitu. >> Well, strategically, first I"
170,00:10:07.21,00:10:07.21,"went up to J.P., and I set up an alliance with him right away."
171,00:10:08.62,00:10:08.62,"Me and him to the end, that was the first thing I said."
172,00:10:10.08,00:10:10.08,And he didn't want to hear why. He was just happy with it.
173,00:10:26.79,00:10:26.79,"But we don't want to get caught, like, a surprise challenge, then"
174,00:10:29.12,00:10:29.12,"we lose, and then right away we go to tribal, and then we don't"
175,00:10:31.46,00:10:31.46,know what we're doing. The next thing I did was I went
176,00:10:33.12,00:10:33.12,"up to Christa and Cecilia, and I put the idea in her head."
177,00:10:36.75,00:10:36.75,"It's like you want to hope for the best, but you got to prepare"
178,00:10:40.04,00:10:40.04,for the worst. If you two are going to get
179,00:10:42.00,00:10:42.00,"together, then I want to be with you two."
180,00:10:43.38,00:10:43.38,">> Right. >> You know, it's out there so"
181,00:10:45.25,00:10:45.25,"we don't get caught. We can just like... you know,"
182,00:10:47.96,00:10:47.96,"whatever, give a sign. >> Okay."
183,00:10:50.08,00:10:50.08,>> And then we know. I was trying to play both sides
184,00:10:52.12,00:10:52.12,"of the fence, because this game shifts so much that if you rely"
185,00:10:55.50,00:10:55.50,"on just one alliance or one person to get you to the end,"
186,00:10:59.58,00:10:59.58,you're not going to make it. >> PROBST: Hiki has their torch!
187,00:11:05.96,00:11:05.96,They're coming back! At the first immunity challenge
188,00:11:08.58,00:11:08.58,on day three... Puka wins the challenge!
189,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,"...Puka, Aitu, and Raro won immunity and flint to make fire."
190,00:11:17.21,00:11:17.21,"Hiki was not so lucky. No fire for you, somebody going"
191,00:11:20.17,00:11:20.17,home. But a surprise was revealed.
192,00:11:22.88,00:11:22.88,The losing tribe will choose one person from any of the other
193,00:11:27.08,00:11:27.08,tribes to go to Exile Island. And the two men of Hiki chose
194,00:11:31.12,00:11:31.12,"Jonathan. On Exile Island, Jonathan"
195,00:11:34.12,00:11:34.12,searched for the hidden immunity idol.
196,00:11:36.50,00:11:36.50,">> The idol! I'm cold, miserable, shivering."
197,00:11:39.58,00:11:39.58,Exile Island's really terrible. >> PROBST: Back at the Hiki
198,00:11:47.12,00:11:47.12,"camp, as this new footage reveals, the tribe considered"
199,00:11:50.25,00:11:50.25,the consequences of losing the first challenge.
200,00:11:54.17,00:11:54.17,>> I think today we learned a lot about working as a team.
201,00:11:58.00,00:11:58.00,>> Rather than us trying to do 50 things?
202,00:12:00.67,00:12:00.67,>> Yeah. >> I don't like being on a
203,00:12:04.04,00:12:04.04,losing team. I don't like it.
204,00:12:07.46,00:12:07.46,"But you know, we're sticking together."
205,00:12:09.00,00:12:09.00,"We're keeping our spirits up. >> You know, it's only natural"
206,00:12:11.25,00:12:11.25,"that we're all just like... I mean, I might not even say it,"
207,00:12:16.04,00:12:16.04,but I think it. >> Of course.
208,00:12:17.50,00:12:17.50,>> And it's just... >> If you have any ounce of
209,00:12:19.25,00:12:19.25,"awareness, you know, I think you do."
210,00:12:23.54,00:12:23.54,>> I knew that I gave it my all and that should be enough.
211,00:12:27.83,00:12:27.83,"But now, because it's been divided by race, it's not"
212,00:12:31.25,00:12:31.25,enough. And that's how the group pretty
213,00:12:35.17,00:12:35.17,"much feels, because we do, on some level, feel like we're"
214,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17,representing a race. If whatever we... if we lose a
215,00:12:42.00,00:12:42.00,"challenge or we don't succeed in something, it has nothing to do"
216,00:12:45.67,00:12:45.67,with the color of our skin. >> No!
217,00:12:47.21,00:12:47.21,>> Nothing. We're just all people trying to
218,00:12:51.38,00:12:51.38,succeed in a game. Now it was just figuring out who
219,00:12:57.21,00:12:57.21,"was the weak link within our tribe, which, again, doesn't"
220,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,"have anything to do with the color of a person's skin, just"
221,00:13:03.46,00:13:03.46,"personality, who clashes. >> PROBST: At the first tribal"
222,00:13:08.54,00:13:08.54,council... First person voted out of
223,00:13:10.38,00:13:10.38,Survivor: Cook Islands... ...the women of Hiki decided
224,00:13:15.04,00:13:15.04,"that Sekou was their weak link. Sekou, the tribe has spoken."
225,00:13:23.04,00:13:23.04,>> I knew my head was on the chopping block.
226,00:13:25.71,00:13:25.71,Nathan kept warning me all along that the sisters would stick
227,00:13:29.08,00:13:29.08,"together. I don't know, maybe they felt I"
228,00:13:31.88,00:13:31.88,was taking a leadership role and they needed to get me out.
229,00:13:35.12,00:13:35.12,"There were some things that I'm not knowledgeable about, but I"
230,00:13:38.04,00:13:38.04,was willing to come out here and learn.
231,00:13:40.12,00:13:40.12,"I take a lot of pride in that. You know, that's what made it"
232,00:13:42.62,00:13:42.62,"such an adventure for me. >> Let me just say straight out,"
233,00:13:54.25,00:13:54.25,"like, I trust you. >> No, that's what... you were"
234,00:13:56.54,00:13:56.54,"from the very beginning, yeah. >> PROBST: On day three, Yul and"
235,00:13:59.75,00:13:59.75,Becky formed an alliance at Puka.
236,00:14:02.25,00:14:02.25,">> Sticking together, obviously, would help us in the game."
237,00:14:04.12,00:14:04.12,>> I want to stay together. I agree.
238,00:14:06.67,00:14:06.67,"Yul and I are both Asian, both Korean, that we're automatically"
239,00:14:10.33,00:14:10.33,going to form alliances because of that.
240,00:14:12.42,00:14:12.42,"In Korean, you call an older brother an opa, and he seems"
241,00:14:17.04,00:14:17.04,"sort of like an older brother to me, and I trust him a lot."
242,00:14:22.88,00:14:22.88,">> Oh, this is good eating. These are some kind of nuts."
243,00:14:27.29,00:14:27.29,I don't know what they call them.
244,00:14:29.12,00:14:29.12,">> PROBST: Later, Cao Boi and Yul searched for food and common"
245,00:14:31.25,00:14:31.25,ground. >> You mentioned the other day
246,00:14:34.42,00:14:34.42,that people assume that you're Japanese.
247,00:14:35.88,00:14:35.88,Why? >> I look... I look Japanese.
248,00:14:38.42,00:14:38.42,"I go to Vietnam, they all try to speak Japanese to me."
249,00:14:40.71,00:14:40.71,"But then I tell them, ""No, why don't you look at a history"
250,00:14:42.50,00:14:42.50,"book? This is your ancestor's face."""
251,00:14:45.67,00:14:45.67,"""No!"" ""All of you look Chinese to me."""
252,00:14:49.12,00:14:49.12,"They don't like that, but they do."
253,00:14:52.50,00:14:52.50,>> A lot of people can't differentiate among Asian
254,00:14:54.92,00:14:54.92,"Americans. I mean, ""Asian American"" is a"
255,00:14:56.79,00:14:56.79,"very broad term that encompasses a broad range of communities,"
256,00:14:59.58,00:14:59.58,and we're not all alike. >> Each one of us is an
257,00:15:03.00,00:15:03.00,"ambassador of our own race, right?"
258,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,>> Yeah. >> We play for our team.
259,00:15:06.17,00:15:06.17,>> Right. >> And when we're in the merge
260,00:15:07.96,00:15:07.96,"together, we keep an eye out for each other."
261,00:15:09.96,00:15:09.96,That's going to be the difference between our culture
262,00:15:11.50,00:15:11.50,versus others. >> All right.
263,00:15:14.12,00:15:14.12,">> I'll see you, brother. Good job."
264,00:15:15.42,00:15:15.42,"Thank you. >> PROBST: At Aitu, Billy wasn't"
265,00:15:21.58,00:15:21.58,"pulling his weight. >> We lose Billy, we come back"
266,00:15:24.92,00:15:24.92,stronger than ever. >> PROBST: So Ozzy suggested a
267,00:15:27.25,00:15:27.25,bold plan to throw the challenge and oust Billy.
268,00:15:30.96,00:15:30.96,">> Billy is just dead weight, so we might as well cut our losses"
269,00:15:34.04,00:15:34.04,"now and get on with the game. >> PROBST: J.P. was on board,"
270,00:15:36.75,00:15:36.75,"but Christina was skeptical. >> I'm thinking, ""You know, this"
271,00:15:39.83,00:15:39.83,"doesn't seem right."" I don't know if I can trust"
272,00:15:41.38,00:15:41.38,Oscar anymore. >> PROBST: But at the
273,00:15:43.92,00:15:43.92,challenge... Puka's on the course.
274,00:15:45.08,00:15:45.08,Raro's on the course. Hiki's on the course.
275,00:15:47.29,00:15:47.29,...Ozzy's plan went into action. Aitu completely unconcerned
276,00:15:50.88,00:15:50.88,"about this challenge. Puka, Raro, Hiki all safe from"
277,00:15:56.08,00:15:56.08,tribal council. Aitu came in dead last and chose
278,00:16:00.29,00:16:00.29,Yul from the Puka tribe to go to Exile Island.
279,00:16:03.50,00:16:03.50,"Yul, boat's waiting for you now. Before the tribes parted, Billy"
280,00:16:05.79,00:16:05.79,thought he and Candice made a connection.
281,00:16:15.08,00:16:15.08,">> PROBST: At Aitu's tribal council on night six, J.P."
282,00:16:17.96,00:16:17.96,confronted Billy about his work ethic.
283,00:16:21.00,00:16:21.00,>> I came here to play the game. That's my dream.
284,00:16:23.00,00:16:23.00,>> Part of the game is trying to involve yourself.
285,00:16:24.50,00:16:24.50,"That way, people find... >> Well, excuse me, I'm still"
286,00:16:26.00,00:16:26.00,"talking here. >> That way, people find you as"
287,00:16:27.33,00:16:27.33,value... >> I'm still talking here.
288,00:16:28.12,00:16:28.12,"You'll get your turn. >> That way, people find you as"
289,00:16:29.67,00:16:29.67,valuable. >> I'm still talking here.
290,00:16:30.58,00:16:30.58,"You'll get your turn, Mr. Bully. >> Because obviously you're not"
291,00:16:32.04,00:16:32.04,valuable. >> My prize isn't even the
292,00:16:33.17,00:16:33.17,million dollars. My prize was I fell in love in
293,00:16:35.08,00:16:35.08,"this game, love at first sight. Her name is Candice, and in"
294,00:16:38.54,00:16:38.54,between... ( laughter )
295,00:16:40.92,00:16:40.92,>> PROBST: Candice from Raro tribe?
296,00:16:42.50,00:16:42.50,">> Yeah. After the last challenge, we"
297,00:16:44.25,00:16:44.25,"sort of mouthed the words ""I love you"" to one another."
298,00:16:46.62,00:16:46.62,So that was my prize. My prize was her.
299,00:16:50.38,00:16:50.38,">> PROBST: In the end, Billy's tribe mates cut him lose."
300,00:16:53.54,00:16:53.54,"Billy, the tribe has spoken. >> Wow."
301,00:17:02.21,00:17:02.21,"I learned so much about myself. First of all, I learned what my"
302,00:17:04.50,00:17:04.50,priority was. I learned that I'm not motivated
303,00:17:06.54,00:17:06.54,by money. I never was.
304,00:17:08.25,00:17:08.25,This game definitely favors those that are willing to stoop.
305,00:17:11.62,00:17:11.62,"That part of the game, I kind of wish I'd have did without and"
306,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,"just played, you know, to have a good time."
307,00:17:17.08,00:17:17.08,I'm definitely not the conniving type or whatever.
308,00:17:19.29,00:17:19.29,That's not for me. That was definitely the wrong
309,00:17:20.92,00:17:20.92,"way to go. >> PROBST: On day six, Yul made"
310,00:17:33.29,00:17:33.29,the most of his time on Exile Island.
311,00:17:38.50,00:17:38.50,">> Oh, mama. I found the immunity idol, which"
312,00:17:40.71,00:17:40.71,is probably the single biggest stroke of luck I could have had.
313,00:17:44.21,00:17:44.21,">> PROBST: and in this never- before-seen footage, Yul"
314,00:17:47.04,00:17:47.04,destroyed the note and covered up all evidence of him finding
315,00:17:49.83,00:17:49.83,the hidden immunity idol. >> I didn't want the box lying
316,00:17:53.83,00:17:53.83,"around on the island, so I constructed a little raft made"
317,00:17:57.21,00:17:57.21,"out of coconut husk, and I'm going to set it adrift."
318,00:18:06.75,00:18:06.75,">> PROBST: With the idol gone, everyone else searched in vain."
319,00:18:13.29,00:18:13.29,">> Okay. ""Use the mast and an island to"
320,00:18:17.21,00:18:17.21,"form a letter. Block out the south, and you'll"
321,00:18:22.46,00:18:22.46,"be doing better."" Okay."
322,00:18:26.58,00:18:26.58,"So many places it can be. I'm just going to cover a big,"
323,00:18:31.08,00:18:31.08,wide swath 20 feet long and three feet down.
324,00:18:36.83,00:18:36.83,"If I don't find it, well, it's not from want of trying, you"
325,00:18:38.96,00:18:38.96,"know. Boy, I could use a toothbrush"
326,00:18:41.58,00:18:41.58,real bad. >> I have a good chance of
327,00:18:54.83,00:18:54.83,"finding it if I'm digging in the right place, but I guess anybody"
328,00:18:57.75,00:18:57.75,has a good chance of finding it if they're digging in the right
329,00:19:01.17,00:19:01.17,place. And it's got to be in between
330,00:19:05.38,00:19:05.38,"here somewhere. >> ""If the southern isle"
331,00:19:10.71,00:19:10.71,"vanishes, a salvation you'll find."""
332,00:19:14.17,00:19:14.17,That makes me think that I should head that way.
333,00:19:25.71,00:19:25.71,>> I don't know if the idol is even still here.
334,00:19:30.08,00:19:30.08,Right now I'm just kind of digging wherever.
335,00:19:37.58,00:19:37.58,">> PROBST: All right, drop your buffs."
336,00:19:41.38,00:19:41.38,"On day seven, the four ethnically divided tribes merged"
337,00:19:45.50,00:19:45.50,into two very diverse groups. You are the new Aitu tribe.
338,00:19:51.12,00:19:51.12,"You are the new Raro tribe. Two new tribes, a whole new"
339,00:19:54.17,00:19:54.17,game. >> Yeah!
340,00:19:56.92,00:19:56.92,"( cheering ) >> One, two, three, Raro!"
341,00:20:06.92,00:20:06.92,">> You just moved up, girl. ( laughter )"
342,00:20:12.71,00:20:12.71,">> At first it's going to be all smiles and ""A pleasure to meet"
343,00:20:14.75,00:20:14.75,"you, and we're glad you're here."""
344,00:20:17.33,00:20:17.33,"But in the back of your mind, it's a game, and you're in it to"
345,00:20:19.71,00:20:19.71,"win it for yourself-- and first and foremost, cold, hard cash."
346,00:20:25.67,00:20:25.67,( cheering ) >> PROBST: At the new Aitu
347,00:20:28.92,00:20:28.92,"tribe, Jonathan and Becky understood this immediately, and"
348,00:20:32.04,00:20:32.04,the game was on. >> I trust Yul.
349,00:20:34.83,00:20:34.83,I trust Candice. >> I totally agree.
350,00:20:37.38,00:20:37.38,"Becky came right to me. She said, ""Yul and I would like"
351,00:20:39.88,00:20:39.88,"to get together with you and Candice."""
352,00:20:41.46,00:20:41.46,"I said, ""I believe that I have Flicka."""
353,00:20:43.38,00:20:43.38,"Stay with me and Candice, and we'll take these other two, and"
354,00:20:45.58,00:20:45.58,the five of us will go to the merge.
355,00:20:48.21,00:20:48.21,>> PROBST: And Yul solidified his bond with Becky.
356,00:20:51.21,00:20:51.21,">> I found the idol. >> Oh, I'm so excited!"
357,00:20:53.88,00:20:53.88,I'm so proud of you. That's so awesome.
358,00:21:00.42,00:21:00.42,">> PROBST: Back at Raro, Parvati saw an opening of her own."
359,00:21:04.21,00:21:04.21,>> There are so many men on this tribe now.
360,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,"It seems like we got all the, like, really big, buff guys."
361,00:21:09.04,00:21:09.04,"Your pants are falling off, Nate."
362,00:21:10.96,00:21:10.96,I'm absolutely going to flirt with them.
363,00:21:12.62,00:21:12.62,It's what I do best. >> I think Parvati feels really
364,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83,"safe because the guys love her. She's, you know, a happy-go-"
365,00:21:24.83,00:21:24.83,"lucky, young, adorable girl, and I don't think they want to see"
366,00:21:28.33,00:21:28.33,her go at all. She's entertainment for them.
367,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,"You know, it's like watching a movie to them, sitting around"
368,00:21:34.21,00:21:34.21,and letting her be adorable. >> Bombs away.
369,00:21:39.08,00:21:39.08,">> Okay, mama, you do that one more time, I'm going to come up"
370,00:21:41.17,00:21:41.17,"there... When I first saw Parvati, I was"
371,00:21:42.71,00:21:42.71,"like, ""Damn!"" >> Boys will be boys, you know?"

491,00:29:09.12,00:29:09.12,"I thought it was Stephannie too, but..."
492,00:29:12.21,00:29:12.21,>> PROBST: But J.P. was kept completely in the dark.
493,00:29:15.04,00:29:15.04,>> And I was just so pissed at myself and wanting us to win so

502,00:29:44.92,00:29:44.92,So I basically played my tail off on that one.

504,00:29:52.29,00:29:52.29,"do what you do, and you go out on top, and you smile, hold your"

522,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,the reward challenge slip from their fingers.
523,00:30:58.75,00:30:58.75,Jessica drops out. Raro wins reward!
524,00:31:02.83,00:31:02.83,( cheering ) And Raro took home wine and
525,00:31:06.08,00:31:06.08,fishing supplies. >> That's what I'm talking
526,00:31:09.04,00:31:09.04,"about! >> PROBST: that night, as seen"
527,00:31:12.58,00:31:12.58,"in this new footage, Raro celebrated."
528,00:31:16.33,00:31:16.33,>> Are we just going to drink out of the bottle?
529,00:31:18.12,00:31:18.12,>> Yeah. >> We're swigging out of the
530,00:31:19.38,00:31:19.38,bottle. >> I'm down with that.
531,00:31:22.29,00:31:22.29,">> We won some wine, so we're getting our fade on, which is"
532,00:31:25.12,00:31:25.12,quite nice. >> That's what I'm talking
533,00:31:27.08,00:31:27.08,"about, dog. >> You know, we can all get"
534,00:31:30.17,00:31:30.17,"loose, and I think everyone's real personalities are going to"
535,00:31:32.96,00:31:32.96,kind of come out when we get a little booze in us-- especially
536,00:31:35.58,00:31:35.58,Stephannie. She don't ever drink.
537,00:31:37.79,00:31:37.79,>> Is it good? >> It tastes like a buttery
538,00:31:41.21,00:31:41.21,Chardonnay. >> We're all happy.
539,00:31:46.38,00:31:46.38,>> No! ( laughter )
540,00:31:53.29,00:31:53.29,">> Let's get this party started! Keep it going, dog!"
541,00:31:56.67,00:31:56.67,>> She's a lightweight here. >> She drunk?
542,00:32:00.12,00:32:00.12,>> Mama's drunk. >> I'm taking care of my mama.
543,00:32:03.12,00:32:03.12,I'm taking care of my mama. >> Mama needs to lay down.
544,00:32:05.67,00:32:05.67,"She hasn't eaten anything. >> Oh, my god!"
545,00:32:08.62,00:32:08.62,She's wasted. ( laughter )
546,00:32:14.17,00:32:14.17,">> Stephannie's, like, on some drugs right now."
547,00:32:16.71,00:32:16.71,She is torn back. >> Give her another shot!
548,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,"( laughter ) >> It's funny, though, because"
549,00:32:24.25,00:32:24.25,you can tell she's like the good old Southern mom who doesn't get
550,00:32:26.54,00:32:26.54,"faded. So, like, a couple of sips, so"
551,00:32:28.96,00:32:28.96,she's kind of like... she's more than drunk.
552,00:32:31.38,00:32:31.38,Home girl's on another level. >> You all right?
553,00:32:36.54,00:32:36.54,">> Hold her up! >> Stephannie had about,"
554,00:32:39.29,00:32:39.29,"probably, like, three swigs, and she's delirious."
555,00:32:44.42,00:32:44.42,She's just talking nonsense and kind of almost passing out.
556,00:32:47.54,00:32:47.54,It's really cute. >> Walk this way.
557,00:32:53.38,00:32:53.38,">> Good girl! >> Okay, we need to get..."
558,00:33:07.46,00:33:07.46,>> What are we doing with it? >> We need some coconut juice.
559,00:33:09.50,00:33:09.50,We need to open up some coconuts.
560,00:33:11.08,00:33:11.08,We need coconut pieces and then a little bit of saltwater.
561,00:33:14.92,00:33:14.92,">> PROBST: On day 13, Christina was getting on Raro's nerves."
562,00:33:18.96,00:33:18.96,">> Then we got to that pot, take it to the water."
563,00:33:21.04,00:33:21.04,>> We're all annoyed by Christina.
564,00:33:22.71,00:33:22.71,"She tells people, ""Can you do this?"
565,00:33:24.67,00:33:24.67,"Can do you that?"" Christina is coming across as,"
566,00:33:31.58,00:33:31.58,"like, our new J.P. So she better watch herself."
567,00:33:44.88,00:33:44.88,">> Mine are worse, aren't they? Are mine worse?"
568,00:33:46.88,00:33:46.88,">> Yours aren't that bad. >> PROBST: At Aitu, Ozzy had a"
569,00:33:52.08,00:33:52.08,"difficult time getting Candice, Sundra, and Becky motivated."
570,00:33:57.62,00:33:57.62,">> Do any of you guys want to go out in the boat to the reef, go"
571,00:34:01.17,00:34:01.17,do some relaxing diving? >> Yeah.
572,00:34:05.25,00:34:05.25,The fish are right out there. >> The reason that I hesitate to
573,00:34:08.62,00:34:08.62,go is that I get really cold. >> Yeah.
574,00:34:11.50,00:34:11.50,">> If it was sunny, I would be out there all day."
575,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,"I feel like once I get really cold, I'm just, like, sitting"
576,00:34:17.08,00:34:17.08,"there, and I'm no good for doing anything."
577,00:34:20.54,00:34:20.54,">> It's starting to get really trying on my patience, and it's"
578,00:34:24.12,00:34:24.12,getting harder and harder for me to motivate to want to go out
579,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,and fish when I know that I get one-eighth of the fish that I
580,00:34:31.88,00:34:31.88,"catch, and the rest of it goes to, you know, some people that"
581,00:34:36.29,00:34:36.29,"aren't as deserving. >> Go for it, guys."
582,00:34:41.17,00:34:41.17,It'll be a little hot. >> Everyone get a crab who wants
583,00:34:44.04,00:34:44.04,a crab? >> I'll eat the bones when
584,00:34:47.67,00:34:47.67,you're done if you're not going to eat them.
585,00:34:49.29,00:34:49.29,>> Eat the bones? >> I'm annoyed that these
586,00:34:52.88,00:34:52.88,princesses sit around. They eat the most.
587,00:34:55.08,00:34:55.08,"They consume the most calories, and they expend the least."
588,00:34:57.62,00:34:57.62,They don't appreciate a darn thing.
589,00:34:59.75,00:34:59.75,They appreciate when they eat it that it tastes great.
590,00:35:02.29,00:35:02.29,"But watch out, there's a knife poised at your back at all"
591,00:35:04.29,00:35:04.29,"times. >> PROBST: Later, Ozzy, Cao Boi,"
592,00:35:17.88,00:35:17.88,and Jessica set out to explore the neighboring island.
593,00:35:21.08,00:35:21.08,">> I don't want to go back, almost."
594,00:35:22.46,00:35:22.46,>> PROBST: And they made a surprising discovery.
595,00:35:24.79,00:35:24.79,>> Why is their tribe here? >> How you doing?
596,00:35:27.12,00:35:27.12,>> PROBST: And Raro was not pleased.
597,00:35:33.12,00:35:33.12,">> How are you, my man? >> Hi, Cao Boi."
598,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,>> Parvati. >> You're Parv...
599,00:35:37.29,00:35:37.29,>> Parvati. >> Par...
600,00:35:38.79,00:35:38.79,>> Par-va-ti. >> Par-va-ti.
601,00:35:41.79,00:35:41.79,>> I didn't like it at all. I don't think they should be on
602,00:35:43.88,00:35:43.88,our island. This is our turf.
603,00:35:45.46,00:35:45.46,This is our territory. They got their own island.
604,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,">> PROBST: On day 14, Aitu won the immunity challenge."
605,00:36:03.12,00:36:03.12,Aitu wins immunity! >> Damn!
606,00:36:09.29,00:36:09.29,>> PROBST: And Raro was united on who should go next.
607,00:36:16.58,00:36:16.58,">> Okay. >> Yeah, yeah."
608,00:36:19.12,00:36:19.12,>> PROBST: But Stephannie's talk of home...
609,00:36:21.08,00:36:21.08,>> I can easily see myself going home and getting some mashed
610,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,potatoes and gravy. >> PROBST: ...made the tribe
611,00:36:25.50,00:36:25.50,question their decision. >> She's already mentally
612,00:36:28.04,00:36:28.04,"checked out. >> PROBST: At tribal council,"
613,00:36:32.33,00:36:32.33,Christina realized she was on shaky ground.
614,00:36:35.29,00:36:35.29,">> Just her personality. You know, it can be a little"
615,00:36:37.46,00:36:37.46,nerve-racking sometimes. >> PROBST: Fifth person voted
616,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,out of the Cook Islands... But it was Stephannie who was
617,00:36:42.12,00:36:42.12,sent back to the home she missed so much.
618,00:36:44.88,00:36:44.88,"Stephannie, the tribe has spoken."
619,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,">> Actually, I'm extremely proud that I made it for 14 days."
620,00:36:51.38,00:36:51.38,"Sure, I would have loved to have stayed in the game a lot longer."
621,00:36:54.08,00:36:54.08,"You know, anybody would be. I think what took me out of the"
622,00:36:57.46,00:36:57.46,"game was the emotional aspect of missing my family, and that"
623,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,really started messing with my psyche.
624,00:37:11.25,00:37:11.25,">> PROBST: After tribal council, Christina confronted her"
625,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,"accusers. >> For the past few days, you"
626,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,"guys have been kind of rude, and I've notice it, like when it"
627,00:37:17.58,00:37:17.58,comes to passing things. You snapped at me twice.
628,00:37:19.83,00:37:19.83,">> I said you were annoying. It's just the way... I mean,"
629,00:37:22.42,00:37:22.42,it's just the way it is. >> I never thought that's what
630,00:37:27.42,00:37:27.42,they thought of me. But I'm going to stick my head
631,00:37:31.04,00:37:31.04,"up high still. You know, I've gone through a"
632,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,lot of stuff. I've been shot and all that
633,00:37:36.12,00:37:36.12,"stuff. I mean, yeah, that's a tragedy"
634,00:37:37.58,00:37:37.58,of my life. I know I survived a lot of other
635,00:37:39.42,00:37:39.42,"things in my life, and I'll survive this."
636,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,">> PROBST: But the next day, Christina couldn't let it go."
637,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,>> I'm not a robot. Just because I'm a cop doesn't
638,00:37:48.38,00:37:48.38,mean I don't have emotions. I have emotions just like you
639,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,and anyone else. >> Right.
640,00:37:52.29,00:37:52.29,">> And you know what? I was going to say something,"
641,00:37:54.21,00:37:54.21,"and I'm like, ""You know, what? If they have a problem, they'll"
642,00:37:55.50,00:37:55.50,"say something to me."" And I actually asked Adam in the"
643,00:37:56.92,00:37:56.92,"boat, ""Is everything okay? Why are you yelling?"""
644,00:37:58.21,00:37:58.21,You didn't say anything about being annoying.
645,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,">> I'm just like, settle down. I mean, it just... it's nerve-"
646,00:38:07.17,00:38:07.17,"racking sometimes. >> Well, then you should have"
647,00:38:09.58,00:38:09.58,said something. >> I said you were annoying.
648,00:38:11.17,00:38:11.17,">> No, you didn't say it. >> I don't know how else to tell"
649,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,"you. >> Honestly, you didn't say it."
650,00:38:13.92,00:38:13.92,"I swear to God you didn't say it, and I never swear to God."
651,00:38:15.21,00:38:15.21,">> Well, I swear I did. >> Maybe you thought you did."
652,00:38:18.21,00:38:18.21,">> Christina, I said it to you. >> Nope."
653,00:38:20.75,00:38:20.75,>> She said over and over again that she wished we would tell
654,00:38:23.04,00:38:23.04,her the way she is and be open and up front.
655,00:38:27.04,00:38:27.04,"You know, if she needs to know it, then I'll tell her."
656,00:38:35.29,00:38:35.29,>> PROBST: At the challenge... Good news/bad news.
657,00:38:37.42,00:38:37.42,Good news is the winners will feast.

659,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,"or lose, both tribes are going to tribal council tonight."
660,00:38:48.21,00:38:48.21,>> Ooh! >> PROBST: Go!
661,00:38:50.00,00:38:50.00,>> Let go. >> PROBST: Aitu endured a brutal
662,00:38:51.71,00:38:51.71,test of physical strength... Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.
663,00:38:55.21,00:38:55.21,...and handed Raro a beat down. Aitu wins the challenge!
664,00:39:01.50,00:39:01.50,Here's how it's going to work tonight.
665,00:39:02.96,00:39:02.96,Aitu will go to tribal council first.
666,00:39:05.00,00:39:05.00,You will vote somebody out. You will then enjoy your feast
667,00:39:08.38,00:39:08.38,while listening in on Raro's tribal council.
668,00:39:16.12,00:39:16.12,"Thinking Jonathan had the immunity idol, Cao Boi dreamed"
669,00:39:19.79,00:39:19.79,up a scheme to get the idol out in the open.
670,00:39:27.88,00:39:27.88,>> Plan Voodoo would split our votes between Jonathan and
671,00:39:29.88,00:39:29.88,Candice. I think the plan is ingenious.
672,00:39:32.79,00:39:32.79,"I know that neither Jonathan or Candice has the immunity idol,"
673,00:39:35.21,00:39:35.21,because I have it. >> PROBST: At tribal council...
674,00:39:39.25,00:39:39.25,Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands.
675,00:39:41.50,00:39:41.50,...Plan Voodoo never came to fruition.
676,00:39:43.79,00:39:43.79,"Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken. And Cao Boi's wild ways finally"
677,00:39:47.00,00:39:47.00,got him voted him out. >> I was perfectly comfortable
678,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,in terms of survival. It was the human element that I
679,00:39:52.08,00:39:52.08,overlooked. The Puka tribe caught me by
680,00:39:55.12,00:39:55.12,surprise. I thought their parents had
681,00:39:57.12,00:39:57.12,taught them honor. I thought they would know what's
682,00:40:00.21,00:40:00.21,right and what's wrong about not screwing somebody over or back-
683,00:40:04.12,00:40:04.12,"stabbing anybody, but I guessed it wrong."
684,00:40:10.08,00:40:10.08,">> PROBST: After Cao Boi's departure, Aitu indulged in a"

687,00:40:18.38,00:40:18.38,"on Raro's drama. >> Unfortunately, she just found"
688,00:40:21.12,00:40:21.12,out our true feelings. >> PROBST: Then another
689,00:40:23.96,00:40:23.96,"surprise. Aitu, you will now kidnap one"
690,00:40:27.08,00:40:27.08,member from the Raro tribe. They will be a part of your
691,00:40:30.75,00:40:30.75,tribe through the next reward challenge.
692,00:40:33.88,00:40:33.88,"Aitu, who are you going to kidnap?"

694,00:40:37.88,00:40:37.88,food. Nate had a hearty meal...
695,00:40:40.21,00:40:40.21,Seventh person voted out of the Cook Islands...
696,00:40:42.88,00:40:42.88,...before Christina was sent packing.
697,00:40:45.04,00:40:45.04,"Christine, the tribe has spoken. >> Being a police officer, you"
698,00:40:50.67,00:40:50.67,"know, you would think you come into a game playing it a certain"
699,00:40:53.33,00:40:53.33,"way and use my experience. But you know, at the same time,"
700,00:40:56.88,00:40:56.88,you realize you're human. You're a person.
701,00:40:59.79,00:40:59.79,You're going to have emotions. You're going to go through
702,00:41:02.00,00:41:02.00,different things like anyone else.
703,00:41:03.62,00:41:03.62,"I would do it all over again, and I'm glad I got the"
