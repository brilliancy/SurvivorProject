32,00:01:53.42,00:01:53.42,"they're not all from onecountry, per se, I'm assuming."

42,00:02:35.12,00:02:35.12,They had just two minutes togather everything they would
43,00:02:39.29,00:02:39.29,need for the next 39 days.30 seconds!
44,00:02:48.75,00:02:48.75,>> The chicken!>> Forget about the chicken!

48,00:03:02.21,00:03:02.21,You had a Latino team.You had an Asian team.
49,00:03:06.62,00:03:06.62,You had a Caucasian team.And then you had an African-
50,00:03:10.08,00:03:10.08,"American team.So I was like, ""Oh, snap, you"
51,00:03:12.75,00:03:12.75,"know, I'm not the only tokenbrother for once."""
52,00:03:19.17,00:03:19.17,>> Ah!>> I personally feel like the
53,00:03:23.33,00:03:23.33,"division is kind of strange.Like, I've never been separated"
54,00:03:28.21,00:03:28.21,"because of my skin color before,and I don't really like it."
55,00:03:33.33,00:03:33.33,">> Row, row!>> The Asian invasion!"
56,00:03:40.17,00:03:40.17,">> I'm pretty, you know, asAmericanized as you can get."
57,00:03:43.04,00:03:43.04,"At the same time, I mean,growing up, there were times"
58,00:03:45.33,00:03:45.33,when people would makepresumptions about me or make
59,00:03:47.29,00:03:47.29,fun of me or insult me becauseof my ethnicity.
60,00:03:50.29,00:03:50.29,"I remember when I was a kid,every time we put up Christmas"
61,00:03:52.29,00:03:52.29,"lights, young kids would come byand smash our Christmas lights."

63,00:04:03.38,00:04:03.38,"piece.Because, like, being a"
64,00:04:06.54,00:04:06.54,"Dominican, what is that going todo for me out here?"
65,00:04:08.62,00:04:08.62,I think that means squat.I think the content of your
66,00:04:10.62,00:04:10.62,"character means everything.Building stuff, there should be"
67,00:04:14.42,00:04:14.42,"the shelter, plus I know how tomake a toilet."
68,00:04:18.08,00:04:18.08,">> You want the machete?>> Well, no."
69,00:04:19.50,00:04:19.50,"First I'll just explain it toyou, and then we'll all be,"
70,00:04:22.04,00:04:22.04,"like, on the same page.We'll all have the blueprint."
71,00:04:23.88,00:04:23.88,>> Do you want them with us?>> They're going to do the
72,00:04:25.83,00:04:25.83,leaves and stuff.They don't really need to hear

75,00:04:33.92,00:04:33.92,>> It was kind of obvious to methat he didn't really know
76,00:04:36.67,00:04:36.67,exactly what he was doing.>> PROBST: ...forcing Ozzy to
77,00:04:40.25,00:04:40.25,"step up.>> Oh, my god."
78,00:04:44.25,00:04:44.25,">> I mean, he may not be verybig, but he's an athlete, and"
79,00:04:46.79,00:04:46.79,he's somebody who'd be prettygood at this game.
80,00:04:49.79,00:04:49.79,>> Really good job.>> Good job.
81,00:04:53.08,00:04:53.08,>> PROBST: On Puka...>> You've got a touch of bad

84,00:04:58.92,00:04:58.92,now.>> It looks like it's burned.
85,00:05:02.58,00:05:02.58,Does it hurt?>> I've never been accepted by
86,00:05:05.00,00:05:05.00,the Asian community.I just don't fit the stereotype.
87,00:05:09.08,00:05:09.08,It's a very dangerous positionfor me to be in.
88,00:05:12.08,00:05:12.08,">> You all know what this is,right?"
89,00:05:14.83,00:05:14.83,"Represent, represent, represent!>> Whoo!"
90,00:05:19.67,00:05:19.67,">> PROBST: At Hiki, Sekouquickly emerged as a natural"

100,00:05:45.42,00:05:45.42,">> PROBST: But as this never-before-seen footage shows, it"
101,00:05:47.92,00:05:47.92,wasn't just Sekou who lackedoutdoor skills at Hiki.
102,00:05:52.17,00:05:52.17,>> Be careful.>> Look at all the water in our

108,00:06:17.33,00:06:17.33,"It's not that we are black,white, Asian, Latino."
109,00:06:20.50,00:06:20.50,It's not that.We're city kids.
110,00:06:23.38,00:06:23.38,We have one person who's fromthe South.
111,00:06:27.12,00:06:27.12,">> Oh, no!Oh, you okay?"
112,00:06:29.04,00:06:29.04,>> Yeah.>> It's harder than it looks.

116,00:06:47.96,00:06:47.96,I never got on a boat that didthat.
117,00:06:52.25,00:06:52.25,>> I have no clue.>> So are you getting in the

119,00:07:03.62,00:07:03.62,me.I'll do it either way.
120,00:07:05.88,00:07:05.88,">> I'll be in the driver's seat.>> We're about to go out,"

137,00:08:22.79,00:08:22.79,"My jaw was shivering.We were wet, and it's just the"
138,00:08:26.25,00:08:26.25,frustration wearing on you.It's the worst situation I've

140,00:08:33.00,00:08:33.00,"I don't want to sit...>> Yeah, I don't think we can"

142,00:08:36.96,00:08:36.96,">> You know, we're just going tohave to sacrifice the boat."
143,00:08:41.92,00:08:41.92,>> What is that?>> I hope that's not them
144,00:08:43.96,00:08:43.96,"flipped over.>> Oh, my god."
145,00:08:49.21,00:08:49.21,">> I don't even see a boat.>> You know, with the wind and"

147,00:08:58.08,00:08:58.08,and we were exhausted.It was awful.
148,00:09:01.04,00:09:01.04,But we finally made it back.>> Can you see the little speck
149,00:09:04.04,00:09:04.04,out there?>> That's our boat?
150,00:09:06.46,00:09:06.46,">> Yeah, I think so.>> Did it flip over?"

153,00:09:11.83,00:09:11.83,It's anchored to the sandbar.>> You couldn't paddle it?
154,00:09:14.33,00:09:14.33,You guys were too tired?I was concerned about Candice

156,00:09:20.75,00:09:20.75,"like, shivering and purple.And then after I got over my"

158,00:09:28.17,00:09:28.17,"We need that to go fishing.Like, we need food."

162,00:09:47.04,00:09:47.04,>> Why do you say we need morecross bars?
163,00:09:48.42,00:09:48.42,">> Because when you lookunderneath, they're starting to"
164,00:09:50.04,00:09:50.04,bow.We probably just need one more.
165,00:09:52.12,00:09:52.12,">> Oh, okay, that's fine.>> All right."
166,00:09:53.67,00:09:53.67,>> There's a couple here.>> PROBST: While the Aitu tribe

169,00:10:07.21,00:10:07.21,"went up to J.P., and I set up analliance with him right away."
170,00:10:08.62,00:10:08.62,"Me and him to the end, that wasthe first thing I said."
171,00:10:10.08,00:10:10.08,And he didn't want to hear why.He was just happy with it.
172,00:10:26.79,00:10:26.79,"But we don't want to get caught,like, a surprise challenge, then"
173,00:10:29.12,00:10:29.12,"we lose, and then right away wego to tribal, and then we don't"
174,00:10:31.46,00:10:31.46,know what we're doing.The next thing I did was I went
175,00:10:33.12,00:10:33.12,"up to Christa and Cecilia, andI put the idea in her head."

183,00:10:52.12,00:10:52.12,"of the fence, because this gameshifts so much that if you rely"

185,00:10:59.58,00:10:59.58,you're not going to make it.>> PROBST: Hiki has their torch!
