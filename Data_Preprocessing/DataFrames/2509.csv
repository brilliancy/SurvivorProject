187,00:12:05.83,00:12:05.83,"SHE'S COMING OVER. GO, RED!"

192,00:12:29.50,00:12:29.50,GRABBED THE BALLS AND PUT THEM UP THERE.

196,00:12:37.77,00:12:37.77,"GO, RED! DENISE ON THE COURSE FOR THE RED"
197,00:12:41.47,00:12:41.47,TEAM. LISA STRUGGLING WITH THAT RICE.

203,00:13:03.63,00:13:03.63,PETE IS OVER THE A-FRAME. PETE NOW HAS TO DIG TO FIND A

206,00:13:14.37,00:13:14.37,PENNER'S STRATEGY REALLY PAYING OFF.
207,00:13:18.03,00:13:18.03,MALCOLM OUT ON THE COURSE IN THE WATER.
208,00:13:19.53,00:13:19.53,"ALL HE'S GOT TO DO IS PICK UP THAT LAST BAG, AND JUST LIKE"

216,00:13:46.27,00:13:46.27,12 BALLS TOTAL NEED TO GO IN THAT BASKET.

218,00:13:54.77,00:13:54.77,CARTER SCORES ONE. ARTIS IS OVER THE A-FRAME.
219,00:13:58.70,00:13:58.70,HE'S STILL GOT TO FIND THE FOURTH BAG.

222,00:14:11.77,00:14:11.77,ARTIS FINALLY FINDS THE BAG AND HE'S CRAWLING THROUGH THE RICE.
223,00:14:16.00,00:14:16.00,SLOWLY THROUGH THAT RICE. SIX.

238,00:15:09.13,00:15:09.13,AND A BIG REWARD ON THE LINE. THAT'S SIX FOR YELLOW.
239,00:15:14.77,00:15:14.77,THIS COULD DO IT. MALCOLM WINS REWARD FOR THE RED

249,00:16:28.80,00:16:28.80,"WALKED US UP TO THIS LOVELY NATIVE VILLAGE, WHICH IS"
250,00:16:31.63,00:16:31.63,"STRAIGHT OUT OF THE ""BLUE LAGOON"" OR SOMETHING."

256,00:16:50.93,00:16:50.93,THIS REWARD IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY.
257,00:16:52.97,00:16:52.97,PEOPLE OF ALL AGES ARE JUST HANGING OUT TOGETHER.
258,00:16:56.20,00:16:56.20,"BROTHERS, SISTERS, MOTHERS, FATHERS, GRANDFATHERS, AND THEY"

261,00:17:16.40,00:17:16.40,WE PLAYED A LOCAL GAME WHICH IS SIMILAR TO A PINATA KIND OF GAME
262,00:17:20.43,00:17:20.43,"WE WOULD HAVE, AND I SORT OF, YOU KNOW, JOKED AROUND A LITTLE"
263,00:17:25.30,00:17:25.30,"BIT, AND THE KIDS WENT WILD.  ( CHEERS )"
264,00:17:28.23,00:17:28.23,IT SEEMS TO BE THE HAPPIEST COMMUNITY I'VE EVER WALKED INTO.

266,00:17:35.63,00:17:35.63,>> NO BOYFRIENDS? >> NO!

271,00:17:50.00,00:17:50.00,"KIDS, AND HOW FULFILLING THAT CAN BE"
272,00:17:53.27,00:17:53.27,( LAUGHTER ) >> WHAT!
273,00:17:57.03,00:17:57.03,WHY DID I GIVE THIS UP? THIS MEANS SO MUCH FOR TO ME
274,00:18:01.37,00:18:01.37,THAN POURING DRINKS FOR GIRLS IN BARS.
275,00:18:03.70,00:18:03.70,IT REALLY MADE ME CONSIDER WHAT I WAS DOING WITH MY LIFE FOR THE
276,00:18:07.07,00:18:07.07,PAST YEAR. IT REALLY WAS A LIFE-SHAPING
277,00:18:09.20,00:18:09.20,"EXPERIENCE FOR ME. >> OH, MY GOD!"
278,00:18:12.00,00:18:12.00,">> OH, MY GOD! >> I WANT SOME SO BAD."

281,00:18:27.27,00:18:27.27,>> IT'S A GREAT BREAK FROM THE GAME ALTHOUGH I HOPE WE GET TO
282,00:18:31.00,00:18:31.00,TALK STRATEGY OVER A BEER OR TWO BECAUSE I'M IN A VERY TOUGH
283,00:18:34.87,00:18:34.87,POSITION. >> THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD
284,00:18:36.17,00:18:36.17,MAKE THIS BETTER IS IF WE HAD SKUPIN.
285,00:18:38.63,00:18:38.63,>> IF WE GET SKUPIN. LISA I THINK WE HAVE TO BE
286,00:18:42.67,00:18:42.67,CAREFUL WITH. >> SKUPIN WAS TREATED HORRIBLY
287,00:18:45.60,00:18:45.60,BY THOSE GUYS. >> HE DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE A
288,00:18:48.87,00:18:48.87,TRAITOR. >> THAT WOULD GIVE MORE MERIT TO
289,00:18:51.97,00:18:51.97,LEAVING THAT THAN STAYING WITH THAT.
290,00:18:54.10,00:18:54.10,OUT OF JUST SOME SENSE OF LOYALTY.
291,00:18:57.53,00:18:57.53,">> RIGHT NOW, THE LINES HAVE BEEN DRAWN AND IT'S FORMER"
292,00:19:03.77,00:19:03.77,"TANDANG VERSUS EVERYONE ELSE, BUT LAST NIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL"
293,00:19:06.60,00:19:06.60,THEY MADE A MOCKERY OF SKUPIN. I FEEL LIKE HE'S BEEN MISTREATED
294,00:19:10.57,00:19:10.57,AND THEY MISTREATED LISA. SO WE'RE TRYING TO GET SKUPIN
295,00:19:13.80,00:19:13.80,AND LISA IN WITH US BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY THE
296,00:19:16.87,00:19:16.87,BIGGEST ROLE IN WHICH ALLIANCE MOVES ON AND WHICH STARTS
297,00:19:21.03,00:19:21.03,"GETTING PICKED OFF. >> I'M PISSED, ARTIS."
298,00:19:32.30,00:19:32.30,">> ME, TOO. >> LOSING A CHALLENGE LIKE THIS"
299,00:19:35.10,00:19:35.10,IS AWFUL. IT'S REALLY DEMORALIZING.
300,00:19:38.87,00:19:38.87,YOU KIND OF NEED THAT ENERGY. BUT AT LEAST I GET TIME WITH
301,00:19:42.93,00:19:42.93,LISA WHO DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AFTER THE TRIBAL
302,00:19:45.37,00:19:45.37,"COUNCIL, WHERE SHE GOT OBLITERATED, AND SKUPIN."
303,00:19:49.30,00:19:49.30,>> BUMMER! >> YUP.
304,00:19:51.23,00:19:51.23,IT'S REALLY IRONIC SOMEONE I WANTED TO GET RID OF FIRST OR
305,00:19:53.90,00:19:53.90,SECOND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME NOW I'M FORCED TO WORK
306,00:19:56.77,00:19:56.77,WITH. BUT WE NEED THE MAJORITY RIGHT
307,00:19:58.17,00:19:58.17,"NOW, AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO IT IS, BUT WHY NOT GO"
308,00:20:00.90,00:20:00.90,TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE STARTED THIS GAME WITH?
309,00:20:03.10,00:20:03.10,WE'RE BACK TO TANDANG STRONG. THEY'RE GOING TO TRUST US A LOT
310,00:20:06.40,00:20:06.40,MORE THAN THEY'RE GOING TO TRUST PENNER OR ANYBODY.
311,00:20:09.43,00:20:09.43,SO GETTING THEM CLOSE AND KEEPING THEM CLOSE IS DEFINITELY
312,00:20:11.97,00:20:11.97,"WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO, AND MAKING THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE."
313,00:20:15.73,00:20:15.73,">> YOU KNOW, IF PENNER DOESN'T WIN IMMUNITY NEXT, HE NEEDS TO"
314,00:20:20.80,00:20:20.80,"GO. >> NO, I KNOW."
315,00:20:21.70,00:20:21.70,>> HE NEEDS TO GO ASAP. HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.
316,00:20:24.77,00:20:24.77,">> AND HE'S ANNOYING. >> YEAH, AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE"
317,00:20:28.43,00:20:28.43,"NOT GOING TO BE... AGAIN, LISA. YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BRING"
318,00:20:31.50,00:20:31.50,INFORMATION FROM OUR SIDE TO THEM.
319,00:20:33.43,00:20:33.43,YOU DON'T NEED TO BRING THAT UP AGAIN.
320,00:20:35.87,00:20:35.87,"I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW. >> I'D LIKE TO SAY, SOME MAY I"
321,00:20:38.80,00:20:38.80,"SAY SOMETHING-- >> ANYWAY, WITH ALL OF THAT"
322,00:20:40.87,00:20:40.87,"BEING SAID, I UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY."
323,00:20:43.57,00:20:43.57,"I THINK YOU'RE JUST GULLIBLE. I THINK YOU'RE JUST NAIVE, AND"
324,00:20:46.97,00:20:46.97,YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO-- TO DO BOTH.
325,00:20:50.63,00:20:50.63,YOU KNOW-- YOU-- YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
326,00:20:52.93,00:20:52.93,>> ABY IS JUST A LOOSE CANNON. SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS SO MUCH
327,00:21:01.37,00:21:01.37,ABOUT THE GAME AND SO MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE IN GENERAL.
328,00:21:03.17,00:21:03.17,I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD HER THAT. BUT SHE NEEDS TO SHUT UP BEFORE
329,00:21:07.30,00:21:07.30,SHE SCHIEWZ EVERYTHING ALL UP. >> IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US
330,00:21:11.27,00:21:11.27,"FIVE RIGHT NOW, AND HOPEFULLY MIKE WILL BE ON BOARD, TOO, TO"
331,00:21:15.43,00:21:15.43,"MAKE SURE THAT FTHAT MAN, PENNER, DOES NOT WIN IMMUNITY"
332,00:21:19.27,00:21:19.27,"TOMORROW, HE'S GOING HOME. ALL FIVE OF US HERE NEEDS TO"
333,00:21:21.93,00:21:21.93,VOTE FOR HIM BECAUSE I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME OR
334,00:21:25.40,00:21:25.40,"FOR PETER AGAIN. SO WE HAVE TO BE REALLY STRONG,"
335,00:21:27.80,00:21:27.80,"THE FIVE OF US. >> ONCE PENNER GOES HOME, THIS"
336,00:21:30.57,00:21:30.57,"IS A CAKEWALK. >> YEAH, LIKE BEING-- YOU JUST"
337,00:21:34.93,00:21:34.93,NEED TO BE A FIGHTER NOW AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE PENNER GOES
338,00:21:37.87,00:21:37.87,HOME. >> I'M ALL FOR THAT.
339,00:21:38.93,00:21:38.93,VERYINTERESTING HOW THINGS SPLIT AT THE CHALLENGE TODAY.
340,00:21:44.30,00:21:44.30,MY THOUGHT WAS AT LEAST WE GOT SOME TIME.
341,00:21:47.70,00:21:47.70,MAYBE WE COULD REEVALUATE AND BE SOLAND I HAD BE TANDANG FIVE.
342,00:21:51.17,00:21:51.17,"BUT THEN I GET BACK HERE TO THE ISLAND, AND ABI WAS TERRIBLE."
343,00:21:54.40,00:21:54.40,">> YOU GOTTA KEEP SKUPIN ON A LITTLE BIT OF A LEASH, TOO--"
344,00:21:59.37,00:21:59.37,">> OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY. >> SO MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE TO GO"
345,00:22:02.60,00:22:02.60,WITH THE OTHER ALLIANCE. BUT I'VE MADE THIS GRAND STAND
346,00:22:05.97,00:22:05.97,"AT TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR LOYALTY TO TANDANG TO KEEP SKUPIN, SO TO"
347,00:22:10.83,00:22:10.83,"FLIP OVER TO KALABAW LOOKS ON THE OUTSIDE REALLY AWFUL, BUT ON"
348,00:22:15.10,00:22:15.10,"THE INSIDE, IT PROBABLY MAKES MORE SENSE."
349,00:22:18.33,00:22:18.33,SO I'M JUST ABSOLUTELY-- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO THINK NOW.
350,00:22:36.33,00:22:36.33,">> Jeff: COME ON IN, GUYS! YOU GUYS READY TO GET TO TODAY'S"

359,00:23:15.83,00:23:15.83,ONE OF SIX SPOTS. FIRST PERSON TO GET A BALL ON

474,00:31:35.27,00:31:35.27,PLAY THIS GAME WITH LISA. BUT I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IF I'M

490,00:32:31.80,00:32:31.80,FROM THE BEGINNING I'VE THOUGHT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS KEEP
491,00:32:35.47,00:32:35.47,TANDANG MEMBERS STRONG BECAUSE I WANT TO STAY LOYAL TO TANDANG.
492,00:32:40.10,00:32:40.10,I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAY FROM THE BEGINNING I WAS LOYAL TO
493,00:32:44.50,00:32:44.50,TANDANG. BUT IF TANDANG IS NO LONGER

553,00:36:25.53,00:36:25.53,PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN BECAUSE I CAME OUT ORIGINALLY FOR THE
554,00:36:29.07,00:36:29.07,MONEY. AND THEN THE GAME GOT BIGGER
555,00:36:32.00,00:36:32.00,THAN THE MONEY. >> Jeff: SO AS A FAN OF THE
556,00:36:35.07,00:36:35.07,"GAME, DID YOU APPRECIATE LISA'S MOVE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL?"

562,00:36:53.27,00:36:53.27,">> Jeff: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> WHAT THAT MEANS IS, IS THIS"
563,00:36:56.90,00:36:56.90,JUST A GAME OR CAN I JUST CUT OFF MY HEART TO PLAY IT?

566,00:37:11.10,00:37:11.10,CAN LEARN IT ALL IN 39 DAYS. BUT I DO KNOW THESE 39 DAYS ARE
567,00:37:16.67,00:37:16.67,GOING TO PROBABLY CHANGE MY MORE THAN MAYBE 39 OF MY 49 YEARS.

574,00:37:42.33,00:37:42.33,"THINK THE TANDANG TRIBE BELIEVES THE NUMBERS WILL SHIFT, BUT"
575,00:37:46.30,00:37:46.30,DEFINITELY THAT'S THE HOPE. THE NUMBERS MAY SHIFT AND THINGS
576,00:37:48.37,00:37:48.37,"WILL BE UPSIDE DOWN TONIGHT. >> Jeff: ABI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?"

588,00:38:29.27,00:38:29.27,"BUT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I NEED TO HEAR THESE WORDS AND THESE"
589,00:38:33.63,00:38:33.63,ACTIONS AND... THINK ABOUT A DECISION.
