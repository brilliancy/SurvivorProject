2,00:00:02.10,00:00:02.10,Survivor... The Morgan Tribe continued
3,00:00:04.50,00:00:04.50,to struggle. >> It's very hard
4,00:00:06.67,00:00:06.67,to not be able to sleep. It's very hard
5,00:00:08.33,00:00:08.33,to freeze every night. >> PROBST: At the first reward
6,00:00:10.87,00:00:10.87,"challenge, the tribes learned that a treasure was buried"
7,00:00:13.67,00:00:13.67,on each of their islands. You want to know what
8,00:00:15.40,00:00:15.40,you're playing for? >> Yeah.
9,00:00:17.00,00:00:17.00,>> PROBST: First clue: piece of the map
10,00:00:18.37,00:00:18.37,that will lead you to your treasure chest.
11,00:00:20.13,00:00:20.13,The winning tribe will also get to loot one item 
12,00:00:22.90,00:00:22.90,one item from the other tribe's camp.
13,00:00:24.97,00:00:24.97,"Go! During the challenge,"
14,00:00:26.70,00:00:26.70,skinny Ryan's struggle caused the Morgans
15,00:00:28.90,00:00:28.90,to fall behind. Drake wins the reward!
16,00:00:31.57,00:00:31.57,">> One, two, three... Drake!"
17,00:00:33.77,00:00:33.77,>> PROBST: Sandra was chosen by her tribe to loot the Morgan
18,00:00:36.20,00:00:36.20,camp. >> I want that tarp.
19,00:00:38.00,00:00:38.00,"I got to do what I got to do, right?"
20,00:00:39.80,00:00:39.80,That whole tribe is a bunch of (bleep).
21,00:00:41.77,00:00:41.77,">> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe was devastated, and Osten"
22,00:00:43.60,00:00:43.60,contemplated quitting. >> Do I sleep out in the cold
23,00:00:46.57,00:00:46.57,"just until I get pneumonia? >> If you're gone, we got no"
24,00:00:48.80,00:00:48.80,hope. >> PROBST: At the immunity
25,00:00:51.57,00:00:51.57,"challenge, the underdog Morgans took an early lead."
26,00:00:54.40,00:00:54.40,>> Here we go! >> PROBST: But in the end...
27,00:00:56.83,00:00:56.83,"Drake wins immunity! ...having had enough,"
28,00:01:00.07,00:01:00.07,"Osten wanted to be voted out. >> When it comes down to it,"
29,00:01:03.27,00:01:03.27,it's mental. I was personally upset
30,00:01:05.23,00:01:05.23,and disappointed with Osten for quitting.
31,00:01:07.37,00:01:07.37,>> PROBST: But at Tribal Council...
32,00:01:09.20,00:01:09.20,Second member voted out of the Morgan Tribe.
33,00:01:11.10,00:01:11.10,...the Morgans decided to keep Osten for his strength
34,00:01:13.50,00:01:13.50,and voted skinny Ryan out of the Pearl Islands.
35,00:01:17.13,00:01:17.13,Fourteen are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
36,00:02:42.63,00:02:42.63,>> We only have six tribe mates left.
37,00:02:44.73,00:02:44.73,"I keep looking around for, uh, two more."
38,00:02:47.90,00:02:47.90,It's kind of strange. Morale is low.
39,00:02:51.53,00:02:51.53,"We need a victory, any kind of victory."
40,00:03:01.13,00:03:01.13,">> We need to stay in this, Lord."
41,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,Help us strive. Give us strength.
42,00:03:09.60,00:03:09.60,I'm praying to give us strength.
43,00:03:13.00,00:03:13.00,Maybe I'm praying for something so personal--
44,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,"my husband, my troop, my new friend Ryan."
45,00:03:24.37,00:03:24.37,"Tribal Council was difficult because I lost, it felt like,"
46,00:03:28.33,00:03:28.33,my best friend in the tribe. And I did vote for Osten
47,00:03:33.23,00:03:33.23,"after some conversation that... yeah, he quit."
48,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,He's the one that didn't have the heart.
49,00:03:41.37,00:03:41.37,So what I'm doing is I'm just staying in here
50,00:03:44.57,00:03:44.57,as long as I can. I'm just going to show
51,00:03:47.37,00:03:47.37,"that I'm worthy to stay here-- maybe above, uh, Darrah."
52,00:03:50.93,00:03:50.93,She's sitting underneath the shelter right now.
53,00:03:55.10,00:03:55.10,>> You don't think Darrah's strong in challenges?
54,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43,">> She's 102 pounds. >> I know, but..."
55,00:04:00.97,00:04:00.97,"no, I mean, in terms of endurance, stamina?"
56,00:04:04.27,00:04:04.27,>> No stronger than me. >> Fair enough. I'm just asking.
57,00:04:09.20,00:04:09.20,">> Well, I do appreciate Osten understanding"
58,00:04:12.93,00:04:12.93,that I just couldn't vote Ryan out.
59,00:04:15.23,00:04:15.23,"But see, that's... that's the other thing, he quit."
60,00:04:17.77,00:04:17.77,He didn't... he didn't quit. He said he was interested
61,00:04:21.83,00:04:21.83,"in quitting, and I think there's a big difference"
62,00:04:24.47,00:04:24.47,between quitting and pulling the trigger and actually quitting.
63,00:04:27.00,00:04:27.00,"You know, there was one point, uh, that Osten threw in the"
64,00:04:29.37,00:04:29.37,towel and said that he  wanted to leave.
65,00:04:31.80,00:04:31.80,"But my concern is that, from a physical standpoint,"
66,00:04:34.70,00:04:34.70,he's somewhat anchoring our tribe.
67,00:04:38.20,00:04:38.20,>> We're not winning challenges right now.
68,00:04:41.20,00:04:41.20,"We're not winning immunity challenges,"
69,00:04:43.43,00:04:43.43,"we're not winning anything. It gets you down a little bit,"
70,00:04:46.77,00:04:46.77,"but, you know, just got to pick it up, just use that as extra"
71,00:04:49.33,00:04:49.33,"motivation. You know, I sat back,"
72,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,"said a prayer to the good man upstairs and, uh..."
73,00:04:55.10,00:04:55.10,"I'm not going to quit. You know, would I like to be"
74,00:04:57.83,00:04:57.83,sitting at home right now eating about three
75,00:04:59.70,00:04:59.70,double cheeseburgers? Absolutely.
76,00:05:02.10,00:05:02.10,But... I'm not right now. >> We got to get O.T.
77,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,fired up for this challenge. He's got to get fired up
78,00:05:09.57,00:05:09.57,like the first one. He was a madman.
79,00:05:11.93,00:05:11.93,He could have lifted that cannon himself.
80,00:05:14.27,00:05:14.27,Every tribe mate has an obligation to the tribe
81,00:05:17.10,00:05:17.10,"that you have to check, you know, your mental infirmities"
82,00:05:19.50,00:05:19.50,"at the door, get rid of those, and just suck it up"
83,00:05:21.97,00:05:21.97,"and do what you need to do. Really, for Osten, the key is"
84,00:05:25.20,00:05:25.20,mental stability and it's... it's something he's going
85,00:05:27.90,00:05:27.90,to struggle with his entire time out here.
86,00:05:30.77,00:05:30.77,"So, I'm just going to do everything I can to help the guy"
87,00:05:32.77,00:05:32.77,"out, to get him back to that... that awesome, larger-than-life"
88,00:05:36.13,00:05:36.13,individual he was  when he set foot on this beach.
89,00:05:48.77,00:05:48.77,>> Everyone think we should go look for the treasure in the
90,00:05:50.63,00:05:50.63,"boat? >> Yeah, I'd love to find"
91,00:05:52.23,00:05:52.23,"the treasure. If it's got good, good,"
92,00:05:54.27,00:05:54.27,"goodies in it, like booze, a big bottle of rum."
93,00:05:57.53,00:05:57.53,(chuckles) >> After winning
94,00:06:00.63,00:06:00.63,"the first reward challenge, we got the first third"
95,00:06:03.50,00:06:03.50,"of our treasure map. We'll be heading east,"
96,00:06:05.97,00:06:05.97,"that way. It said, ""If you go"
97,00:06:09.00,00:06:09.00,"when the time is right""-- and the only way time"
98,00:06:11.50,00:06:11.50,really affects things around here is tide--
99,00:06:13.90,00:06:13.90,"so, it must mean something you can only get to during low tide"
100,00:06:16.20,00:06:16.20,"or see during low tide. >> So, we took out the boat--"
101,00:06:24.97,00:06:24.97,we decided to go and look for big landmarks--
102,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00,and we went around for... I don't know how long
103,00:06:30.13,00:06:30.13,we were out for. And it was hard because
104,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,"the more we were searching, the more possibilities"
105,00:06:35.33,00:06:35.33,we were coming up with. >> I want to find
106,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,that treasure so bad. What about right here?
107,00:06:44.07,00:06:44.07,It just eats me up that there's a treasure
108,00:06:46.83,00:06:46.83,out there that could have warm clothes
109,00:06:49.17,00:06:49.17,"or junk food or potato chips or, I don't know,"
110,00:06:52.57,00:06:52.57,something in there. >> What about...
111,00:06:54.83,00:06:54.83,"is there something around this way, too?"
112,00:06:56.33,00:06:56.33,>> There's probably more sand around this way.
113,00:06:58.77,00:06:58.77,We're baffled right now. We've been searching
114,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,and searching and haven't found the treasure
115,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,"yet, but we'll find it. It's going to take almost all of"
116,00:07:06.23,00:07:06.23,us to dig in this one part. >> I know.
117,00:07:09.03,00:07:09.03,>> Our tribe went out half-cocked.
118,00:07:10.90,00:07:10.90,"I played into that for awhile, too, until I "
119,00:07:12.80,00:07:12.80,started thinking about it. Pirates were not idiots and
120,00:07:16.70,00:07:16.70,people are not idiots. And you don't bury things in
121,00:07:18.80,00:07:18.80,the sand that you don't want to be washed back up.
122,00:07:22.57,00:07:22.57,>> You guys just want us to dig up the whole island?
123,00:07:24.40,00:07:24.40,>> Sounds like it's about it. Kind of got a little discouraged
124,00:07:27.27,00:07:27.27,"and decided to, um, take a break and check another time,"
125,00:07:30.07,00:07:30.07,"and hopefully get another piece of the map today,"
126,00:07:33.17,00:07:33.17,so we can get that next clue. >> Tree mail.
127,00:07:40.70,00:07:40.70,">> Tree mail, tree mail, tree mail!"
128,00:07:43.90,00:07:43.90,"""Ever get that sinking feeling that you just can't stay"
129,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,afloat? Is it the fault of a lazy crew
130,00:07:49.93,00:07:49.93,or a problem with your boat? Should you bail out of
131,00:07:53.20,00:07:53.20,"trouble, or steer the other way, Will you get a good night's"
132,00:07:56.87,00:07:56.87,"sleep, will your possessions go away?"""
133,00:08:00.43,00:08:00.43,">> If we screw up on this one, they're gonna come"
134,00:08:02.63,00:08:02.63,and take whatever. >> Steal something else.
135,00:08:04.80,00:08:04.80,">> Right now, we need this win, I think, more than anything."
136,00:08:07.33,00:08:07.33,"When we read the tree mail, it was a reward for some"
137,00:08:10.13,00:08:10.13,"sleeping material. So, I'm assuming, like, blankets"
138,00:08:12.77,00:08:12.77,"and pillows and stuff like that. And then, we get to raid"
139,00:08:15.67,00:08:15.67,the other tribe's camp. >> I want is some clothes.
140,00:08:18.13,00:08:18.13,">> Oh, clothes? Yeah, child. >> A blanket."
141,00:08:20.90,00:08:20.90,>> If I have to be as cold as it was last night--
142,00:08:22.77,00:08:22.77,"I was freezing. >> Well, we alternated"
143,00:08:26.13,00:08:26.13,in thinking about is who's going to sit out.
144,00:08:28.10,00:08:28.10,">> If it... if it's physical, I'll sit out this one."
145,00:08:30.73,00:08:30.73,"If it's not, I won't. We're heading"
146,00:08:32.83,00:08:32.83,"into a reward challenge, so we have to think about who"
147,00:08:35.50,00:08:35.50,"we're going to sit out, because we are getting the"
148,00:08:38.23,00:08:38.23,"advantage over the Morgan Tribe and we will have to sit out,"
149,00:08:40.50,00:08:40.50,"you know, two people. If it happens to be"
150,00:08:42.57,00:08:42.57,"a swimming challenge, Sandra's not the best"
151,00:08:44.50,00:08:44.50,swimmer in the world. Sandra wouldn't be a bad one
152,00:08:46.17,00:08:46.17,"to do today, because the immunity"
153,00:08:48.63,00:08:48.63,could have swimming. >> So what makes you
154,00:08:50.63,00:08:50.63,a better swimmer than me? >> I'm not saying
155,00:08:52.53,00:08:52.53,that you can't swim! I'm just saying we want...
156,00:08:54.10,00:08:54.10,">> The day we jumped off the boat, where were you"
157,00:08:57.27,00:08:57.27,when I was already onshore? Still in the damn water.
158,00:09:01.03,00:09:01.03,"I said, ""When we jumped off the boat the very first day,"
159,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,"I had already landed on shore."" He was still out there"
160,00:09:06.43,00:09:06.43,"doggy paddling. So, he's weaker than I am."
161,00:09:09.30,00:09:09.30,But he gets mad. He doesn't want to seem like
162,00:09:11.53,00:09:11.53,"he's the weakest one out here, which he is."
163,00:09:13.43,00:09:13.43,">> Okay, like, when we were swimming to shore,"
164,00:09:15.57,00:09:15.57,"I had her glasses in my sock, I couldn't"
165,00:09:17.60,00:09:17.60,"kick my legs, so I swam with just my arms,"
166,00:09:20.47,00:09:20.47,"and how much did you beat me by, using your entire body to swim"
167,00:09:23.03,00:09:23.03,and me just using my arms? >> What day? What day?
168,00:09:25.03,00:09:25.03,">> Day one! Day one! Swimming from the boat,"
169,00:09:27.53,00:09:27.53,you beat me by so bad. How much did you beat me by?
170,00:09:29.27,00:09:29.27,>> Swimming to the boat? What are you talking about?
171,00:09:30.57,00:09:30.57,">> Swimming from the boat, when we jumped off the (clang) boat"
172,00:09:32.53,00:09:32.53,and we went to the shore. If you beat me so (clang) bad
173,00:09:35.40,00:09:35.40,"and I just used my arms, how bad did you beat me?"
174,00:09:38.23,00:09:38.23,">> You know what? I can get loud, too!"
175,00:09:40.40,00:09:40.40,"What the ... I can get loud, too!"
176,00:09:42.63,00:09:42.63,>> I don't want to (clang) argue with you.
177,00:09:44.13,00:09:44.13,That's why I'm (clang) from you. You're the one who wants
178,00:09:46.50,00:09:46.50,to fight. I walked away because she could
179,00:09:48.47,00:09:48.47,argue all day long. That's because she's foolish.
180,00:09:51.07,00:09:51.07,">> I can have a bigger mouth. >> Good, have the (clang) last"
181,00:09:53.87,00:09:53.87,word! That's all you (clang) want.
182,00:09:56.13,00:09:56.13,">> Well, then, be quiet, so that I can finish it."
183,00:09:58.53,00:09:58.53,"Screw Jon, 'cause he's an ass. Everything that comes out"
184,00:10:02.50,00:10:02.50,of his mouth is just ridiculous. >> Her days are numbered.
185,00:10:05.73,00:10:05.73,"We have bigger threats to get rid of first, but she's not one"
186,00:10:08.33,00:10:08.33,"of the final four. So... And I, and I got a mil"
187,00:10:12.43,00:10:12.43,that says she won't be the final one.
188,00:10:23.43,00:10:23.43,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Okay, you guys ready"
189,00:10:27.07,00:10:27.07,for the challenge? >> Yes.
190,00:10:29.93,00:10:29.93,">> PROBST: For today's reward challenge, you will battle the"

192,00:10:35.87,00:10:35.87,"There will be two boats for each tribe,"
193,00:10:37.90,00:10:37.90,three people in each boat. Your goal: sink both
194,00:10:40.87,00:10:40.87,of the other tribe's boats. Each boat will have eight holes.
195,00:10:44.53,00:10:44.53,Those holes are plugged with corks.
196,00:10:47.07,00:10:47.07,"Using your grappling hook, get ahold of that cork"
197,00:10:49.70,00:10:49.70,"and pull it out of the boat, causing the boat to sink."
198,00:10:52.83,00:10:52.83,You can also use it to grab the boat
199,00:10:54.80,00:10:54.80,and bring it closer to you. You can also use it
200,00:10:56.67,00:10:56.67,to push down on that other boat and try and sink it.
201,00:10:59.17,00:10:59.17,The bucket can be used for bailing water
202,00:11:01.43,00:11:01.43,out of your own boat. You can also use it to put water
203,00:11:03.20,00:11:03.20,onto the other boat. Want to know
204,00:11:05.83,00:11:05.83,what you're playing for? >> Yeah!
205,00:11:09.93,00:11:09.93,>> Whoa! >> Oh.
206,00:11:14.10,00:11:14.10,">> PROBST: You got a mattress, you got four pillows,"
207,00:11:16.43,00:11:16.43,"and you have four blankets. In addition, another piece"
208,00:11:19.97,00:11:19.97,of the puzzle to finding your buried treasure.
209,00:11:23.87,00:11:23.87,"For Drake, it'll be your second piece."
210,00:11:26.37,00:11:26.37,"Morgan, it would your first. And the fun part"
211,00:11:28.63,00:11:28.63,of reward challenge is the winning tribe
212,00:11:31.07,00:11:31.07,gets to loot one item from the losing tribe.
213,00:11:33.67,00:11:33.67,"Drake, because you have two extra members,"
214,00:11:35.80,00:11:35.80,"you're sitting two people out, keeping in mind you cannot"
215,00:11:37.77,00:11:37.77,sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges.
216,00:11:40.83,00:11:40.83,"Who's it going to be? Jon, Michelle, sitting out."
217,00:11:48.23,00:11:48.23,"Everybody else, swim out, wait for my ""Go."""
218,00:11:58.97,00:11:58.97,"Here we go, guys. Last boat floating"
219,00:12:02.03,00:12:02.03,wins reward for their tribe. Survivors ready?
220,00:12:06.43,00:12:06.43,Go! Drake making
221,00:12:13.17,00:12:13.17,a beeline for Morgan. Shawn and Osten battling.
222,00:12:18.83,00:12:18.83,Lill throwing some water. Christa throwing some water.
223,00:12:22.93,00:12:22.93,"Osten almost out, but hangs on. Trish pulls the first cork"
224,00:12:30.50,00:12:30.50,from the Morgan Tribe. Osten pulls a cork
225,00:12:38.13,00:12:38.13,from Rupert's boat. All boats are taking on water.
226,00:12:50.33,00:12:50.33,"Darrah doing damage to Drake with her bucket, soaking Rupert."
227,00:12:55.93,00:12:55.93,Drake taking on a lot of water. (shouting)
228,00:13:00.97,00:13:00.97,Osten's boat has moved away from the action.
229,00:13:03.70,00:13:03.70,>> Get over here! >> PROBST: Rupert using brute

231,00:13:16.13,00:13:16.13,Osten's boat taking on a lot of water.
232,00:13:19.70,00:13:19.70,"Osten, you're sinking your own boat."
233,00:13:24.47,00:13:24.47,You need to bail. Morgan's boat is down.
234,00:13:30.70,00:13:30.70,"Osten, Lill, Tijuana, you're out."
235,00:13:34.00,00:13:34.00,"Morgan down to one boat, getting double-teamed."
236,00:13:37.17,00:13:37.17,You guys need to get out of there.
237,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,Get out of there. Ryan trying to get
238,00:13:42.87,00:13:42.87,some force on Drake's boat. Rupert putting the hammer down
239,00:13:48.00,00:13:48.00,on Morgan. Morgan taking on a lot of water.
240,00:13:59.23,00:13:59.23,Drake wins their fourth challenge in a row.
241,00:14:02.70,00:14:02.70,Wins reward. (cheering)
242,00:14:13.73,00:14:13.73,"All right, Drake-- your mattress,"
243,00:14:16.60,00:14:16.60,"four blankets, four pillows, will be delivered to camp."
244,00:14:20.17,00:14:20.17,We'll do the looting tomorrow morning.
245,00:14:22.27,00:14:22.27,"Morgan, expect another visit from Drake,"
246,00:14:24.47,00:14:24.47,"and we're gonna take one item. >> Yeah, we just got"
247,00:14:51.47,00:14:51.47,our ass kicked again. It takes all the fun away.
248,00:14:54.50,00:14:54.50,It's just demoralizing. God. How can you not
249,00:14:58.00,00:14:58.00,take it personally? How can you
250,00:15:00.33,00:15:00.33,"not let it affect you? Well, we just came back from"
251,00:15:03.17,00:15:03.17,our second reward challenge. We lost miserably.
252,00:15:06.43,00:15:06.43,"All-time low, the Morgan Tribe. They won, they get the bed,"
253,00:15:09.93,00:15:09.93,they get the pillows and the blankets
254,00:15:11.77,00:15:11.77,and that's something that strikes so near
255,00:15:13.87,00:15:13.87,"and dear to our hearts, because the only thing"
256,00:15:16.07,00:15:16.07,"we ever complain about is the, uh, sleeping,"
257,00:15:18.70,00:15:18.70,"um, facility. >> So, why do you think we're"
258,00:15:22.80,00:15:22.80,getting our ass kicked? >> I think a couple
259,00:15:25.30,00:15:25.30,of their players were stronger than
260,00:15:27.33,00:15:27.33,a couple of our players. >> In every situation?
261,00:15:29.80,00:15:29.80,">> No, not in every situation, but Rupert has killed us."
262,00:15:32.67,00:15:32.67,We had as many plugs out as they did.
263,00:15:35.00,00:15:35.00,"Rupert was stronger. Right now, the problem"
264,00:15:38.43,00:15:38.43,with the Morgan Tribe is we're doubting ourselves.
265,00:15:42.33,00:15:42.33,We're doubting whether we can actually win.
266,00:15:45.60,00:15:45.60,Osten's on the fence. I don't... I don't know
267,00:15:47.43,00:15:47.43,if he has the confidence. He definitely doesn't have the
268,00:15:49.73,00:15:49.73,confidence he had in day three. All's you need
269,00:15:52.53,00:15:52.53,"is something to roll, like, just something"
270,00:15:54.87,00:15:54.87,"to start you off. Like, for instance, like,"
271,00:15:57.17,00:15:57.17,"when a tugboat pulls out those big ships,"
272,00:15:58.93,00:15:58.93,it just needs something to get it started.
273,00:16:01.43,00:16:01.43,>> I think we're doing fine. >> So do I.
274,00:16:03.87,00:16:03.87,>> There's a couple of things I think...
275,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17,"Like, I want to go fishing in the morning."
276,00:16:07.10,00:16:07.10,Do I know anything about fishing? No.
277,00:16:09.73,00:16:09.73,But am I going to try it? Yes. >> What are you smiling
278,00:16:28.70,00:16:28.70,"about, sleepy head? You'd get fired,"
279,00:16:32.07,00:16:32.07,if you were working for me. >> Where's Lill?
280,00:16:34.47,00:16:34.47,">> Oh, I don't know. She went by herself fishing."
281,00:16:36.87,00:16:36.87,"This needs to stop, guys. She just... people just"
282,00:16:40.60,00:16:40.60,going off in different directions.
283,00:16:42.83,00:16:42.83,"A little bit ago, Lill went fishing by herself."
284,00:16:45.87,00:16:45.87,I think we need to be more of a team
285,00:16:48.27,00:16:48.27,and we're still doing this separatist stuff
286,00:16:51.03,00:16:51.03,"and I'm... I'm tired of it. It's nothing against her,"
287,00:16:53.73,00:16:53.73,"it's just, here we are again, spreading out."
288,00:17:02.00,00:17:02.00,>> I decided last night-- we need some food.
289,00:17:04.70,00:17:04.70,The rice had sand in it. I can't even swallow that
290,00:17:08.50,00:17:08.50,"without throwing up. So, I told the guys"
291,00:17:11.53,00:17:11.53,"I was gonna go fishing, and they said,"
292,00:17:14.30,00:17:14.30,"""Well, you need two people."" Well, they still are in bed."
293,00:17:17.67,00:17:17.67,"Okay, God, I need some help here."
294,00:17:20.63,00:17:20.63,(Jaws-like theme playing) (gasps)
295,00:17:31.03,00:17:31.03,"Oh, my God. I just lost the hook."
296,00:17:36.27,00:17:36.27,"Oh, I'm gone for good now. I think we started"
297,00:17:42.27,00:17:42.27,with three or four hooks. We're down to one.
298,00:17:46.07,00:17:46.07,There was a blowfish in the water--
299,00:17:48.10,00:17:48.10,which I know you can't eat-- and they're the ones
300,00:17:51.37,00:17:51.37,that kept taking my bait. And then I lost the hook.
301,00:17:57.63,00:17:57.63,>> How we doing? >> Great on blowfish.
302,00:18:01.37,00:18:01.37,They love me. I gave them breakfast.
303,00:18:06.07,00:18:06.07,>> Nothing else? >> Nothing. I couldn't
304,00:18:09.27,00:18:09.27,even see anything else. And I lost the hook.
305,00:18:14.97,00:18:14.97,>> Seriously. You lost it on the rocks
306,00:18:21.27,00:18:21.27,"or something? >> No, they just took it."
307,00:18:25.10,00:18:25.10,"I had the fisherman, uh, knot on there,"
308,00:18:28.37,00:18:28.37,"and it was strong. >> I'm shocked, actually."
309,00:18:32.63,00:18:32.63,I'm a deer in headlights because she's a Boy Scout troop master
310,00:18:35.77,00:18:35.77,"and she knows many different knots,"
311,00:18:38.03,00:18:38.03,including the fisherman's knot. The only way you lose
312,00:18:41.30,00:18:41.30,"a hook like that is two ways: either the line breaks,"
313,00:18:43.93,00:18:43.93,"which it didn't, or your knot wasn't secure,"
314,00:18:47.00,00:18:47.00,"which it wasn't. I don't know, man."
315,00:18:50.53,00:18:50.53,"We got to... We got to have a talk with Lill, I guess."
316,00:18:53.40,00:18:53.40,She's just not... >> She's not accepting of
317,00:18:56.07,00:18:56.07,"any talks, you know that. >> Well, hey, she's gonna"
318,00:18:58.73,00:18:58.73,have to accept something. I'm pissed.
319,00:19:02.07,00:19:02.07,She's being a little bit impatient
320,00:19:04.13,00:19:04.13,about the whole issue of going fishing.
321,00:19:06.40,00:19:06.40,"If she waited just that little bit,"
322,00:19:08.13,00:19:08.13,"I would have been able to go with her,"
323,00:19:09.57,00:19:09.57,"but next thing you know, she's gone,"
324,00:19:11.13,00:19:11.13,and I wasn't too happy about it.
325,00:19:14.10,00:19:14.10,">> If we lose the next go-around, it's either me or"
326,00:19:17.20,00:19:17.20,"Darrah. So, I was hoping that I"
327,00:19:21.43,00:19:21.43,"could, you know, just shine a little bit here."
328,00:19:38.10,00:19:38.10,>> Oh. See? See? We're going
329,00:19:40.07,00:19:40.07,around the island. That's all the rocky stuff.
330,00:19:42.33,00:19:42.33,"Just need one more map. >> Yeah, he only said"
331,00:19:44.60,00:19:44.60,there were three. Anyone want to go
332,00:19:46.57,00:19:46.57,"for a quick treasure hunt? >> Last night, it was decided"
333,00:19:48.37,00:19:48.37,that the treasure hunt was the last thing on
334,00:19:50.10,00:19:50.10,our list of things to do. We should do everything
335,00:19:51.83,00:19:51.83,"else before that. >> Yeah, but we got"
336,00:19:53.47,00:19:53.47,"everything else done. >> Hey, you guys,"
337,00:19:56.20,00:19:56.20,pillage the village? Hello?
338,00:19:58.87,00:19:58.87,>> Hello. >> Am I going?
339,00:20:01.57,00:20:01.57,">> To pillage? Yeah, oh, yeah."
340,00:20:04.43,00:20:04.43,>> I was chosen among our... our tribe here
341,00:20:07.43,00:20:07.43,"to go loot the other tribe, as part of our reward"
342,00:20:10.47,00:20:10.47,for winning the challenge the other day.
343,00:20:13.17,00:20:13.17,Just take what you have to take and then just leave.
344,00:20:15.43,00:20:15.43,">> Don't tell them anything about us,"
345,00:20:16.93,00:20:16.93,and try to find out all the dirt on them.
346,00:20:18.63,00:20:18.63,">> The last time, Sandra came back and reported"
347,00:20:20.60,00:20:20.60,that they had one water pot for all their food
348,00:20:23.10,00:20:23.10,"and all their water. So, group decision,"
349,00:20:26.17,00:20:26.17,"we're taking their water pot. But if they only have one pot,"
350,00:20:29.67,00:20:29.67,"you guys, how are they going to boil water?"
351,00:20:31.43,00:20:31.43,>> I know. How are they going to live?
352,00:20:32.67,00:20:32.67,">> How would you boil water, Burton,"
353,00:20:35.07,00:20:35.07,"and survive without a pot? >> Because, if they come to us"
354,00:20:37.70,00:20:37.70,"and take ours, we're screwed. But if we have two then,"
355,00:20:40.33,00:20:40.33,they can take one back and we're not so screwed.
356,00:20:42.00,00:20:42.00,">> Just like we have two tarps now, they take one..."
357,00:20:43.80,00:20:43.80,>> Water is a little different than a tarp.
358,00:20:45.53,00:20:45.53,>> You have to have water to live.
359,00:20:47.13,00:20:47.13,">> Really, we're taking away their life."
360,00:20:49.23,00:20:49.23,">> If their pot is the only water cleaning source they have,"
361,00:20:51.63,00:20:51.63,"my God, I feel terrible about taking it."
362,00:20:55.00,00:20:55.00,"But I have to remind myself, we are pirates"
363,00:20:57.60,00:20:57.60,and this is our game. And Drake is the power
364,00:21:02.50,00:21:02.50,"to be reckoned with. >> They would do the same to us,"
365,00:21:09.17,00:21:09.17,if they could. >> Absolutely will.
366,00:21:10.87,00:21:10.87,">> They hate us. >> Right now, I'm making a,"
367,00:21:24.27,00:21:24.27,"uh... or trying to make a dragnet, maybe to catch some"
368,00:21:26.83,00:21:26.83,fish. I got to become MacGyver out here
369,00:21:29.60,00:21:29.60,"to be able to survive, I guess. >> Won't they take it?"
370,00:21:34.63,00:21:34.63,What if we just bunch it back up like a useless net
371,00:21:37.73,00:21:37.73,and stick it in the dinghy? >> Okay.
372,00:21:41.67,00:21:41.67,">> Not a good morning. One of the, uh, infamous Drake"
373,00:21:44.07,00:21:44.07,tribe members is coming over to loot our camp to take one
374,00:21:47.47,00:21:47.47,of our prized possessions. We don't have
375,00:21:50.97,00:21:50.97,a whole lot right now. >> They can't take
376,00:21:54.23,00:21:54.23,"our canteens, right? >> No."
377,00:21:56.10,00:21:56.10,">> No, I don't think they can take all of them."
378,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83,>> The two boiling pots are in a strategic area.
379,00:22:02.27,00:22:02.27,The one thing that I hope we don't lose
380,00:22:04.70,00:22:04.70,"is the silver pan, because we need it to boil water in."
381,00:22:08.10,00:22:08.10,"But it's got some really, really nasty,"
382,00:22:10.33,00:22:10.33,"uh, blanket in it right now that's been cooking for a while,"
383,00:22:13.37,00:22:13.37,"so, you know, let them, uh, take the thing hot."
384,00:22:16.37,00:22:16.37,I don't care. Burn their hands. (chuckles)
385,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,Is there a boat coming? >> Who is it?
386,00:22:28.37,00:22:28.37,>> It's Drake. Looks like the blonde chick.
387,00:22:31.23,00:22:31.23,>> The tall blonde? >> It's all right.
388,00:22:33.93,00:22:33.93,It's all right. How are you? What's your name?
389,00:22:36.40,00:22:36.40,">> Christa. >> Christa, I'm Tijuana."
390,00:22:38.10,00:22:38.10,Nice to meet you. Congratulations again.
391,00:22:41.27,00:22:41.27,"Come on to our humble abode. This is Christa, guys."
392,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,">> Hey, I'm Andrew, by the way. We haven't formally met."
393,00:22:47.13,00:22:47.13,Good to meet you after all this time.
394,00:22:49.57,00:22:49.57,>> After all this time. Everything good?
395,00:22:51.60,00:22:51.60,>> Everything's good. >> Good night's sleep?
396,00:22:53.63,00:22:53.63,">> I bet, with those pillows and blankets."
397,00:22:55.67,00:22:55.67,">> Did everyone fit on...? >> No, nobody could fit all"
398,00:22:57.23,00:22:57.23,"on the mattress. >> I use my buff, and I roll"
399,00:22:59.63,00:22:59.63,it up for my pillow at night. (Christa laughing)
400,00:23:02.83,00:23:02.83,">> You guys, I hate to, you know, cut it short."
401,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,I'm going to take the... your big old pot behind you.
402,00:23:09.40,00:23:09.40,">> It's hot. >> Yeah, watch your fingers,"
403,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,that's very hot. >> Thank God they had another
404,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,pot. Thank God. I would've felt horrible.
405,00:23:16.60,00:23:16.60,I don't even think I could have looked at any of them
406,00:23:18.60,00:23:18.60,in the eyes when I left. >> They don't have any pots?
407,00:23:21.70,00:23:21.70,>> I don't know. >> It's really cool
408,00:23:24.40,00:23:24.40,"in your tribe, pretty much? or you got some...?"
409,00:23:27.90,00:23:27.90,">> Yeah, yeah. Everybody's getting along."
410,00:23:29.57,00:23:29.57,">> So, who's the leader? Do you, have a..."
411,00:23:32.93,00:23:32.93,"did you designate a...? >> Uh, nobody."
412,00:23:34.90,00:23:34.90,Everybody just kicks back. It's just the strangest thing.
413,00:23:37.00,00:23:37.00,It was just really hard because I was just put
414,00:23:40.20,00:23:40.20,so on the spot. I felt so under pressure--
415,00:23:42.57,00:23:42.57,"everybody was trying to hammer me with questions,"
416,00:23:44.67,00:23:44.67,and I was just trying to think of the right thing to say.
417,00:23:47.10,00:23:47.10,">> The first immunity challenge you lose, who do you think's"
418,00:23:48.83,00:23:48.83,gone in your tribe? >> I have no idea.
419,00:23:51.10,00:23:51.10,"Well, that's the funny part... >> Come on."
420,00:23:52.97,00:23:52.97,">> No, I really don't. I really don't."
421,00:23:54.70,00:23:54.70,">> I mean, it doesn't matter if we know because we're not"
422,00:23:56.33,00:23:56.33,in your tribe. >> I know.
423,00:23:57.80,00:23:57.80,"I don't know, you guys. I didn't tell them anything."
424,00:24:01.00,00:24:01.00,"At least I was trying not to tell them anything,"
425,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73,and it was just really hard. It was overwhelming.
426,00:24:05.77,00:24:05.77,It was overwhelming. I just wanted
427,00:24:07.17,00:24:07.17,to get out of there. I just wanted to get
428,00:24:08.80,00:24:08.80,"out of there. You guys, it's been a pleasure."
429,00:24:10.53,00:24:10.53,"I'm sorry. Give me a hug, you guys."
430,00:24:12.67,00:24:12.67,>> It was nice meeting you; you're sweet.
431,00:24:14.50,00:24:14.50,">> All right, you guys. >> Bye."
432,00:24:16.57,00:24:16.57,">> Later on, Ryan. Later on, Darrah."
433,00:24:18.53,00:24:18.53,">> I asked her, if they lose immunity,"
434,00:24:20.77,00:24:20.77,who gets voted out? Said she has no idea.
435,00:24:24.23,00:24:24.23,>> She's lying. Just think about it.
436,00:24:26.53,00:24:26.53,The girl's trying to be crafty. She ain't as dumb and dorky
437,00:24:28.47,00:24:28.47,as she's trying to play off. Her Big Bird-type personality
438,00:24:30.73,00:24:30.73,she's trying to portray on us is ridiculous.
439,00:24:33.00,00:24:33.00,"It's a farce, it's a phony."
440,00:24:34.97,00:24:34.97,">> I think, right now, the Morgan Tribe, mentally,"
441,00:24:37.40,00:24:37.40,"is probably stronger than the Drake Tribe,"
442,00:24:39.47,00:24:39.47,because we have experienced so much defeat.
443,00:24:41.57,00:24:41.57,"You know, they've probably been sleeping better than us,"
444,00:24:43.17,00:24:43.17,probably have the same amount of water.
445,00:24:45.10,00:24:45.10,They definitely have the same amount of bug bites.
446,00:24:47.43,00:24:47.43,"But they have this euphoria, the adrenaline that naturally "
447,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,"results from winning, and that's huge out here."
448,00:24:53.40,00:24:53.40,We haven't had that yet. So I can't wait for Drake
449,00:24:55.87,00:24:55.87,to suffer some defeat and see if they just crumble.
450,00:25:16.23,00:25:16.23,">> Oh, baby. Oh, baby. This looks like a compass."
451,00:25:22.87,00:25:22.87,"We got mail, guys. Here's our flag."
452,00:25:26.07,00:25:26.07,>> How cool. That's awesome.
453,00:25:29.00,00:25:29.00,"Look at that thing. >> ""Your flag holds tribe pride,"
454,00:25:32.53,00:25:32.53,"never let it fall. Select a friend to represent,"
455,00:25:37.10,00:25:37.10,choose the one most small. You must also
456,00:25:40.17,00:25:40.17,"choose your strongest, on their shoulders"
457,00:25:43.53,00:25:43.53,your fate will rest. 'Pure Will'
458,00:25:46.10,00:25:46.10,"in a game of fortitude, defines this final test."""
459,00:25:49.47,00:25:49.47,">> We just got some, uh, tree mail."
460,00:25:52.87,00:25:52.87,It indicated we should select our smallest and our strongest.
461,00:25:56.00,00:25:56.00,"You the strongest? >> I hope so, yeah."
462,00:25:59.60,00:25:59.60,>> I agree. >> Yeah.
463,00:26:02.37,00:26:02.37,">> Osten has struggled a little bit, uh,"
464,00:26:06.03,00:26:06.03,psychologically in the last couple of days.
465,00:26:08.23,00:26:08.23,"He clearly has the physical strength, but he also has to"
466,00:26:10.77,00:26:10.77,have the focus and the mental toughness.
467,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50,"Not to put any pressure on you, so our entire fate"
468,00:26:14.80,00:26:14.80,"is on your shoulders. >> Play it, don't say it."
469,00:26:17.47,00:26:17.47,>> All right. It says to choose your smallest.
470,00:26:19.43,00:26:19.43,"You're the smallest, right? >> I guess."
471,00:26:23.80,00:26:23.80,"We need to win this challenge today bad, because going"
472,00:26:26.87,00:26:26.87,"to Tribal Council is not fun, and, you know, who wants"
473,00:26:29.63,00:26:29.63,"to vote off a member of your own tribe, you know?"
474,00:26:32.23,00:26:32.23,And now we have six and they have eight.
475,00:26:34.70,00:26:34.70,Sounds like a two-man show. >> We're down four.
476,00:26:37.50,00:26:37.50,"Four challenges we've lost. We go to another Tribal Council,"
477,00:26:40.83,00:26:40.83,"we're finished. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
478,00:26:51.10,00:26:51.10,I like the tribe flags. Looking good.
479,00:26:53.73,00:26:53.73,You'll be bringing those with you to challenges.
480,00:26:55.60,00:26:55.60,"Okay, first things first. Thank you, Shawn."
481,00:27:01.03,00:27:01.03,Immunity back up for grabs. We talk a lot about
482,00:27:05.53,00:27:05.53,pulling your own weight in this game Survivor.
483,00:27:09.70,00:27:09.70,Today's challenge is going to put that notion
484,00:27:11.70,00:27:11.70,to the test literally. Dangling over the water are
485,00:27:15.07,00:27:15.07,"your two smallest tribe mates-- Michelle for Drake,"
486,00:27:18.00,00:27:18.00,Darrah for Morgan. The rest of you are going
487,00:27:20.70,00:27:20.70,"to hold them up, using a rope and pulley system."
488,00:27:23.40,00:27:23.40,The two tribe mates that you chose as your strongest--
489,00:27:25.80,00:27:25.80,"Rupert for Drake, Osten for Morgan--"
490,00:27:27.97,00:27:27.97,are going to be your anchors at the back.
491,00:27:30.03,00:27:30.03,"And, every five minutes, a tribe mate at the front"
492,00:27:32.13,00:27:32.13,"will let go of the rope, which will put more weight"
493,00:27:34.00,00:27:34.00,on the people in the back until only Rupert and Osten remain.
494,00:27:37.03,00:27:37.03,"At that point, it becomes a showdown between "
495,00:27:39.37,00:27:39.37,"these final two tribe members. For the losers,"
496,00:27:42.93,00:27:42.93,"a trip to Tribal Council, a lot at stake."
497,00:27:45.47,00:27:45.47,"Drake, you sat out Jon and Michelle in the last challenge."
498,00:27:49.00,00:27:49.00,Who are you sitting out today? Burton and Trish.
499,00:27:52.03,00:27:52.03,"All right. Everybody gear up,"
500,00:27:53.53,00:27:53.53,"wait for my ""Go."" Here we go, for immunity."
501,00:27:58.50,00:27:58.50,Survivors ready? Unhook.
502,00:28:04.77,00:28:04.77,Go! You guys doing all right?
503,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,"First five minutes. Jon, Lill, let go of the ropes."
504,00:28:21.20,00:28:21.20,Take a spot back on your mats. And then there were four.
505,00:28:25.47,00:28:25.47,"How you doing, Sandra? >> Couldn't be any better."
506,00:28:28.23,00:28:28.23,">> PROBST: You got another five minutes in you, right?"
507,00:28:29.97,00:28:29.97,">> Six, if I have to. >> PROBST: Okay, we've reached"
508,00:28:37.60,00:28:37.60,"another five minutes. Tijuana, Sandra,"
509,00:28:40.20,00:28:40.20,let go of the rope now. You guys need to take
510,00:28:44.50,00:28:44.50,as much of this off of these final two as you can.
511,00:28:52.33,00:28:52.33,"Five more minutes have elapsed. Christa, Andrew,"
512,00:28:56.37,00:28:56.37,"let go of the rope now. Ryno, gonna have to do"
513,00:28:59.27,00:28:59.27,some work now. Shawn having to do some work.
514,00:29:02.73,00:29:02.73,"Michelle, tell me how you're feeling."
515,00:29:04.93,00:29:04.93,So-so? What's hurting? The legs?
516,00:29:07.83,00:29:07.83,">> I can't even feel my legs. >> PROBST: Darrah, how are your"
517,00:29:10.40,00:29:10.40,legs? >> Numb.
518,00:29:12.17,00:29:12.17,>> PROBST: You want them to let you go?
519,00:29:13.80,00:29:13.80,>> No. >> PROBST: Another five minutes
520,00:29:21.27,00:29:21.27,"have elapsed. Shawn, Ryno, let go now."
521,00:29:24.93,00:29:24.93,"This is it, down to the big men."
522,00:29:30.67,00:29:30.67,"Remember, guys, we're going to make this harder as we go along."
523,00:29:37.47,00:29:37.47,Michelle does not look comfortable right now.
524,00:29:39.77,00:29:39.77,">> Looking good, baby, looking good!"
525,00:29:42.03,00:29:42.03,">> That's it, Darrah. >> Hang in there, Darrah."
526,00:29:43.97,00:29:43.97,">> Good job, Darrah! >> Whoo!"
527,00:29:57.10,00:29:57.10,">> PROBST: You guys feeling the bugs crawling around you,"
528,00:29:59.37,00:29:59.37,coming out of the sand? >> There's no bugs.
529,00:30:01.93,00:30:01.93,>> PROBST: Or is the pain overriding that?
530,00:30:04.27,00:30:04.27,>> We sleep in bugs. We love crabs
531,00:30:07.80,00:30:07.80,on our head at night. >> PROBST: Let me throw out a
532,00:30:17.67,00:30:17.67,notion-- What are the odds that Darrah or Michelle will quit?
533,00:30:22.43,00:30:22.43,Do you have any idea how much pain they're in?
534,00:30:25.33,00:30:25.33,Someone will quit. One of you two
535,00:30:27.13,00:30:27.13,"or one of those two will quit. All right, guys,"
536,00:30:36.97,00:30:36.97,you've reached 90 minutes. The rest of the challenge is now
537,00:30:39.43,00:30:39.43,"going to play out on your feet, so go ahead"
538,00:30:42.13,00:30:42.13,and transition to your feet. (rope creaks)
539,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,Down to the nitty-gritty now. Osten's struggling to hang on.
540,00:30:50.23,00:30:50.23,Rupert is using his midsection. Michelle and Darrah
541,00:30:53.53,00:30:53.53,are doing their best to keep some circulation
542,00:30:55.33,00:30:55.33,in their body. Rupert's showing some signs
543,00:30:58.57,00:30:58.57,of struggle. >> Uh-oh. Be careful.
544,00:31:01.17,00:31:01.17,>> PROBST: Michelle dropping a little bit.
545,00:31:03.67,00:31:03.67,Rupert trying to find a new spot.
546,00:31:05.83,00:31:05.83,Nothing comfortable. Everything hurts.
547,00:31:32.67,00:31:32.67,You guys are at two hours. Gonna move to the last phase.
548,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,There will be no leaning against the hitching post with your body
549,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17,and no wrapping the rope around the hitching post.
550,00:31:43.07,00:31:43.07,"It's going to be on your feet, back, rope in your hands."
551,00:31:46.33,00:31:46.33,It's coming down to pure body strength and will.
552,00:31:50.03,00:31:50.03,"Five, four, three, two, one. Get it off, off, off."
553,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,"Keep it off your hitching post, Osten."
554,00:32:02.83,00:32:02.83,"Get it up off there, Osten. Don't quit, guys. Fight."
555,00:32:07.87,00:32:07.87,">> Come on, Osten. >> You got it. You got it."
556,00:32:09.30,00:32:09.30,">> That a way. >> Come on, Osten."
557,00:32:12.53,00:32:12.53,"Come on, Osten. >> PROBST: Stay strong, you guys"
558,00:32:15.37,00:32:15.37,have been out here a long time. Get it up off that.
559,00:32:17.63,00:32:17.63,"Don't use it as leverage. Osten, you got to keep your body"
560,00:32:19.47,00:32:19.47,off it. (gasps)
561,00:32:24.00,00:32:24.00,"Boom, Osten can't hang. Rupert wins immunity for Drake."
562,00:32:28.07,00:32:28.07,(cheering) >> Yeah!
563,00:32:31.40,00:32:31.40,(cheering) You are the king!
564,00:32:37.60,00:32:37.60,">> PROBST: Drake, third straight time, immunity."
565,00:32:41.23,00:32:41.23,Go on back to your camp. >> (screams): Yeah!
566,00:32:45.80,00:32:45.80,">> PROBST: Morgan, I wish we had different news."
567,00:32:48.20,00:32:48.20,Great effort. Did what you could do.
568,00:32:50.33,00:32:50.33,"Hung in there a long time, just wasn't enough."
569,00:32:52.23,00:32:52.23,Tribal Council once again. Voting somebody else out.
570,00:32:55.60,00:32:55.60,You guys can head back to camp. See you at Tribal.
571,00:32:58.03,00:32:58.03,"(applause) >> You know, after this"
572,00:33:26.07,00:33:26.07,"immunity challenge, you start thinking to yourselves, ""What"
573,00:33:28.77,00:33:28.77,"do we have to do to win?"" This was different than"
574,00:33:32.07,00:33:32.07,"a couple of the others, because this, there's nothing"
575,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,else we could've done to win. I couldn't believe
576,00:33:38.53,00:33:38.53,you lasted that long. I thought it'd be...
577,00:33:40.87,00:33:40.87,five minutes. >> The weight of the world
578,00:33:44.73,00:33:44.73,"was on my shoulders for a day, and I didn't come up at the end."
579,00:33:48.53,00:33:48.53,I just didn't have the energy left to hold it up.
580,00:33:50.90,00:33:50.90,"I was spent, my hands were chopped up,"
581,00:33:52.77,00:33:52.77,"and the rope just slipped... was slipping through my hands,"
582,00:33:55.37,00:33:55.37,so it was just a matter of time. >> Facing Tribal Council
583,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"the third time in a row is, uh, disheartening."
584,00:34:03.37,00:34:03.37,"It's one of us, and I don't want it to be me."
585,00:34:06.00,00:34:06.00,>> Who does more around camp? (laughs softly)
586,00:34:09.00,00:34:09.00,">> Um, well, of course. Her work ethic, she never quits."
587,00:34:13.00,00:34:13.00,Even when she could slack off if she wanted to.
588,00:34:15.93,00:34:15.93,>> Is there anything that Lill does that D can't?
589,00:34:18.30,00:34:18.30,">> That's what I'm saying, like, who can't do a fire?"
590,00:34:20.07,00:34:20.07,"Who can't go get water, day in and day out?"
591,00:34:22.97,00:34:22.97,">> Ryno, O.T. and myself and T have... an alliance,"
592,00:34:26.90,00:34:26.90,I guess you would call it. So we're not going anywhere.
593,00:34:29.53,00:34:29.53,So it's either Darrah or Lill. Raw intelligence.
594,00:34:33.00,00:34:33.00,>> Raw intelligence. Her ability to think
595,00:34:34.73,00:34:34.73,outside the box. I haven't seen any of
596,00:34:37.47,00:34:37.47,"that from Darrah, tell you... tell you the truth."
597,00:34:39.33,00:34:39.33,"Not that it's not there, but... This is a critical vote--"
598,00:34:43.30,00:34:43.30,"we're down to six, we're gonna be down one more,"
599,00:34:45.77,00:34:45.77,"as of tonight. Clearly, Lill's up here--"
600,00:34:48.10,00:34:48.10,"contributes a hell of a lot more than Darrah,"
601,00:34:50.53,00:34:50.53,"from what I can see at camp. In the challenges,"
602,00:34:53.13,00:34:53.13,Darrah's probably stronger. I don't think Lill could have
603,00:34:55.07,00:34:55.07,"done what Darrah did, being suspended in the tripod."
604,00:35:00.20,00:35:00.20,The person that is... least valuable to the tribe is
605,00:35:02.93,00:35:02.93,"the one that should go tonight, and whoever that is,"
606,00:35:05.87,00:35:05.87,"shouldn't have any problem with it, because they should put"
607,00:35:08.50,00:35:08.50,the interests of the tribe ahead of their own personal 
608,00:35:11.37,00:35:11.37,"interests. Now, that's a good theory..."
609,00:35:13.80,00:35:13.80,"(chuckles), but... How would you feel if you were"
610,00:35:18.20,00:35:18.20,"the one to go tonight? >> Very, very resentful."
611,00:35:22.63,00:35:22.63,">> Well, we'll have to have a conversation."
612,00:35:25.20,00:35:25.20,">> Well, you know what? >> I mean, it's a tough issue..."
613,00:35:27.43,00:35:27.43,">> Listen, I'm so glad you had the balls just to talk to me."
614,00:35:29.97,00:35:29.97,">> Oh, hell, either way, Lill, you've been an unbelievable "
615,00:35:32.43,00:35:32.43,asset to this tribe. The least you deserve is
616,00:35:35.47,00:35:35.47,"the brutal, honest truth. If it's not going your way,"
617,00:35:39.03,00:35:39.03,"I'll tell you. If it's going your way,"
618,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57,I'll tell you. >> I'm just looking at it
619,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43,that we need to win the next challenge.
620,00:35:45.40,00:35:45.40,>> Right. I think what's been looked at is
621,00:35:47.57,00:35:47.57,the strength and weaknesses on both ends.
622,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"Just curious, um, if you thought more about it,"
623,00:35:53.07,00:35:53.07,or if it was a factor to be concerned about or not or...
624,00:35:56.07,00:35:56.07,">> I mean, yeah, I want to say, too, but I'm not gonna go"
625,00:35:59.07,00:35:59.07,whine and mope around like she's doing.
626,00:36:02.53,00:36:02.53,">> Darrah and I, we walked around the cove."
627,00:36:04.67,00:36:04.67,"We talked about, basically, what's going on."
628,00:36:06.63,00:36:06.63,I let her know that... she potentially would be
629,00:36:08.50,00:36:08.50,"on the cutting block tonight, and she was pretty nonchalant"
630,00:36:11.27,00:36:11.27,about it. Which kind of concerns me.
631,00:36:14.40,00:36:14.40,"I don't know what that means. I could very well take it as,"
632,00:36:16.63,00:36:16.63,"does she care, or is she overly confident to know"
633,00:36:19.57,00:36:19.57,that that's not gonna happen? She didn't have anything
634,00:36:21.80,00:36:21.80,"to say, actually. >> Really? Did she say that"
635,00:36:23.60,00:36:23.60,she's stronger or... >> She didn't say anything.
636,00:36:26.13,00:36:26.13,>> You're kidding. Does Darrah think
637,00:36:28.37,00:36:28.37,she's not going anywhere? >> I have no clue.
638,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,>> Does Darrah deserve... has she earned her spot in our
639,00:36:33.93,00:36:33.93,tribe to make it another three days?
640,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,I don't know. >> PROBST: Welcome to another
641,00:37:01.40,00:37:01.40,"windy Tribal Council. So, let's get to it."
642,00:37:04.67,00:37:04.67,"As of now, you're one of the losingest tribes"
643,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,"ever, and with many more challenges to go, chances are"
644,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,you may set a record that won't be broken.
645,00:37:13.93,00:37:13.93,"So, Tijuana, is the Drake tribe simply a better tribe?"
646,00:37:19.63,00:37:19.63,">> No, they're not. I think we have a better tribe."
647,00:37:22.27,00:37:22.27,"Um, we are very focused. It's just us coming together"
648,00:37:25.83,00:37:25.83,"when it comes time for challenge time,"
649,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,"and we're not doing that. >> PROBST: Ryno, do you agree"
650,00:37:30.70,00:37:30.70,with that? Is this tribe really
651,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,"unified and focused? >> Yeah, I believe we're..."
652,00:37:36.40,00:37:36.40,we're pretty unified. It's just one of those
653,00:37:38.70,00:37:38.70,things right now. You got to get over a hump.
654,00:37:40.77,00:37:40.77,"You know, you're gonna get a win."
655,00:37:42.57,00:37:42.57,It's-it's inevitable. >> PROBST: Really?
656,00:37:45.57,00:37:45.57,">> I believe it's so. I mean, at our challenge,"
657,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,"Osten was the man-- I mean, I think we did great."
658,00:37:50.93,00:37:50.93,">> PROBST: Osten, are you surprised at where this tribe"
659,00:37:53.57,00:37:53.57,is at? >> I feel still we have a lot
660,00:37:56.03,00:37:56.03,of fight left in this team; it's not over.
661,00:37:57.90,00:37:57.90,We still have a pulse; heart's still beating.
662,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,And everybody goes through a slump.
663,00:38:01.80,00:38:01.80,It's just the ability to come out sooner than later.
664,00:38:04.47,00:38:04.47,">> PROBST: So, this is the thing I don't get."
665,00:38:06.67,00:38:06.67,You guys don't seem worried. You haven't won a challenge.
666,00:38:10.03,00:38:10.03,"In fact, you've self-destructed at several challenges."
667,00:38:12.70,00:38:12.70,"And here you come and you're, like, ""Eh, you know what?"
668,00:38:14.73,00:38:14.73,"We'll get it together. It's a slump."""
669,00:38:16.33,00:38:16.33,>> Everyone's worried about it. There's nothing worse than
670,00:38:18.23,00:38:18.23,"going O-and-five, and it's demoralizing,"
671,00:38:21.37,00:38:21.37,"but the good news is that we're all strong-willed,"
672,00:38:24.80,00:38:24.80,"and I predict, the next challenge,"
673,00:38:26.70,00:38:26.70,"we're gonna be on-on the top, on the winning side."
674,00:38:29.53,00:38:29.53,">> PROBST: Well, you know, four more Tribal Councils,"
675,00:38:31.77,00:38:31.77,"we have no tribe left. So, Tijuana, do you think about"
676,00:38:34.53,00:38:34.53,"""We got to do better challenges""?"
677,00:38:36.73,00:38:36.73,"Do you think about, ""I need something to eat""?"
678,00:38:38.97,00:38:38.97,What's the overriding thought that's going through your head
679,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,"out here right now? >> I think, overall,"
680,00:38:43.27,00:38:43.27,"um, just working together, understanding what our strengths"
681,00:38:45.40,00:38:45.40,"and weaknesses are, and how are we gonna stay"
682,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,"together as a team, no matter what."
683,00:38:49.90,00:38:49.90,">> PROBST: Darrah, you're living with"
684,00:38:51.97,00:38:51.97,virtually nothing. What areas are you
685,00:38:54.30,00:38:54.30,"uncomfortable with? >> Um, I guess not knowing"
686,00:38:56.37,00:38:56.37,"really how to build a fire, you know."
687,00:38:58.47,00:38:58.47,I'm not good at fires. That's Lill's job.
688,00:39:01.27,00:39:01.27,"But, you know, I put out my 110% at the challenges."
689,00:39:04.63,00:39:04.63,"Just like yesterday, I thought I was gonna die,"
690,00:39:07.40,00:39:07.40,but quitting never went through my mind.
691,00:39:10.23,00:39:10.23,">> PROBST: So, Lill, you got to feel pretty good"
692,00:39:12.03,00:39:12.03,about your place in this tribe and what you bring to it.
693,00:39:14.23,00:39:14.23,>> I'd like to think I'm valuable.
694,00:39:16.70,00:39:16.70,"You know, I was never more proud when, um, Andrew said"
695,00:39:19.27,00:39:19.27,"that I had good work ethics, which I do."
696,00:39:24.67,00:39:24.67,"Now, hopefully, they'll look at that"
697,00:39:26.57,00:39:26.57,and consider that when they're voting.
698,00:39:30.90,00:39:30.90,">> PROBST: It is time to vote.  Ryno, you're up."
699,00:39:46.90,00:39:46.90,">> Lill, you're a great woman and a hard worker,"
700,00:39:50.30,00:39:50.30,and you contributed well around camp.
701,00:40:02.23,00:40:02.23,">> Darrah, you are like the Mississippi belle."
702,00:40:06.17,00:40:06.17,You're fragile and know very few skills.
703,00:40:10.33,00:40:10.33,"No hard feelings, honey. >> This is totally based"
704,00:40:26.43,00:40:26.43,upon a strategy. We'll see if it works.
705,00:40:34.67,00:40:34.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
706,00:40:46.53,00:40:46.53,"Once the votes are read, the  decision is final."
707,00:40:49.27,00:40:49.27,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
708,00:40:51.07,00:40:51.07,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
709,00:40:56.33,00:40:56.33,First vote... Lill.
710,00:41:03.03,00:41:03.03,Darrah. Lill.
711,00:41:10.53,00:41:10.53,"That's two votes Lill, one vote Darrah."
712,00:41:15.03,00:41:15.03,Three votes Lill. Third person
713,00:41:20.07,00:41:20.07,voted out of the Morgan Tribe... Lill.
714,00:41:24.57,00:41:24.57,"That's four votes, that's enough."
715,00:41:26.43,00:41:26.43,"You need to bring me your torch. Lill, the tribe has spoken."
716,00:41:39.03,00:41:39.03,Try that again. They don't want you to go.
717,00:41:41.67,00:41:41.67,">> Yeah, right. >> PROBST: It's time for you"
718,00:41:46.43,00:41:46.43,"to go. Well, I don't think"
719,00:41:57.60,00:41:57.60,tonight's vote was easy. Don't give up on yourselves.
720,00:42:01.03,00:42:01.03,"Get your torches, head back to camp."
721,00:42:03.20,00:42:03.20,Good night. Stay tuned for scenes
722,00:42:23.27,00:42:23.27,from our next episode. Next time on Survivor...
723,00:42:28.73,00:42:28.73,"At Drake, winning has a downside."
724,00:42:30.57,00:42:30.57,>> A little more help would be appreciated.
725,00:42:32.40,00:42:32.40,>> It's starting to get annoying because we really want somebody
726,00:42:34.47,00:42:34.47,to leave. >> At some point we should lose.
727,00:42:37.47,00:42:37.47,Can you do that? >> He's a traitor.
728,00:42:39.70,00:42:39.70,"If this was a pirate culture, he'd already be dead."
729,00:42:42.60,00:42:42.60,>> PROBST: And Osten's in trouble.
730,00:42:43.70,00:42:43.70,"Osten, you're okay? >> I need help!"
731,00:42:45.70,00:42:45.70,>> PROBST: Hang on! >> My biggest regret is that
732,00:42:52.80,00:42:52.80,I didn't stay in longer to represent
733,00:42:55.20,00:42:55.20,my beautiful state of Ohio. It bothers me that our leader
734,00:42:59.30,00:42:59.30,"said he would get back to me after I stated my case,"
735,00:43:02.67,00:43:02.67,and he didn't. Because it does seem to be
736,00:43:06.83,00:43:06.83,"a game of a lot of deceit and a lot of lying, and I'm not"
737,00:43:10.53,00:43:10.53,real good at that.
