18,00:00:38.00,00:00:38.00,"I got to do what I got to do,right?"
19,00:00:39.80,00:00:39.80,That whole tribe is a bunch of(bleep).

26,00:00:56.83,00:00:56.83,"Drake wins immunity!...having had enough,"
27,00:01:00.07,00:01:00.07,"Osten wanted to be voted out.>> When it comes down to it,"
28,00:01:03.27,00:01:03.27,it's mental.I was personally upset
29,00:01:05.23,00:01:05.23,and disappointedwith Osten for quitting.
30,00:01:07.37,00:01:07.37,>> PROBST: But at TribalCouncil...
31,00:01:09.20,00:01:09.20,Second member voted outof the Morgan Tribe.
32,00:01:11.10,00:01:11.10,...the Morgans decided to keepOsten for his strength
33,00:01:13.50,00:01:13.50,and voted skinny Ryan outof the Pearl Islands.
34,00:01:17.13,00:01:17.13,Fourteen are left.Who will be voted out tonight?
35,00:02:42.63,00:02:42.63,>> We only have sixtribe mates left.
36,00:02:44.73,00:02:44.73,"I keep looking aroundfor, uh, two more."
37,00:02:47.90,00:02:47.90,It's kind of strange.Morale is low.
38,00:02:51.53,00:02:51.53,"We need a victory,any kind of victory."
39,00:03:01.13,00:03:01.13,">> We need to stay in this,Lord."
40,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,Help us strive.Give us strength.
41,00:03:09.60,00:03:09.60,I'm prayingto give us strength.
42,00:03:13.00,00:03:13.00,Maybe I'm praying for somethingso personal--
43,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,"my husband, my troop,my new friend Ryan."
44,00:03:24.37,00:03:24.37,"Tribal Council was difficultbecause I lost, it felt like,"
45,00:03:28.33,00:03:28.33,my best friend in the tribe.And I did vote for Osten
46,00:03:33.23,00:03:33.23,"after some conversationthat... yeah, he quit."
47,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,He's the one thatdidn't have the heart.
48,00:03:41.37,00:03:41.37,So what I'm doing isI'm just staying in here
49,00:03:44.57,00:03:44.57,as long as I can.I'm just going to show
50,00:03:47.37,00:03:47.37,"that I'm worthy to stay here--maybe above, uh, Darrah."
51,00:03:50.93,00:03:50.93,She's sitting underneaththe shelter right now.
52,00:03:55.10,00:03:55.10,>> You don't think Darrah'sstrong in challenges?
53,00:03:58.43,00:03:58.43,">> She's 102 pounds.>> I know, but..."
54,00:04:00.97,00:04:00.97,"no, I mean, in terms ofendurance, stamina?"
55,00:04:04.27,00:04:04.27,>> No stronger than me.>> Fair enough. I'm just asking.
56,00:04:09.20,00:04:09.20,">> Well, I do appreciateOsten understanding"
57,00:04:12.93,00:04:12.93,that I just couldn'tvote Ryan out.
58,00:04:15.23,00:04:15.23,"But see, that's...that's the other thing, he quit."
59,00:04:17.77,00:04:17.77,He didn't... he didn't quit.He said he was interested
60,00:04:21.83,00:04:21.83,"in quitting, and I thinkthere's a big difference"
61,00:04:24.47,00:04:24.47,between quitting and pulling thetrigger and actually quitting.
62,00:04:27.00,00:04:27.00,"You know, there was one point,uh, that Osten threw in the"
63,00:04:29.37,00:04:29.37,towel and said that he wanted to leave.
64,00:04:31.80,00:04:31.80,"But my concern is that,from a physical standpoint,"
65,00:04:34.70,00:04:34.70,he's somewhat anchoringour tribe.
66,00:04:38.20,00:04:38.20,>> We're not winningchallenges right now.
67,00:04:41.20,00:04:41.20,"We're not winningimmunity challenges,"
68,00:04:43.43,00:04:43.43,"we're not winning anything.It gets you down a little bit,"
69,00:04:46.77,00:04:46.77,"but, you know, just got to pickit up, just use that as extra"
70,00:04:49.33,00:04:49.33,"motivation.You know, I sat back,"
71,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,"said a prayer to the good manupstairs and, uh..."
72,00:04:55.10,00:04:55.10,"I'm not going to quit.You know, would I like to be"
73,00:04:57.83,00:04:57.83,sitting at home right noweating about three
74,00:04:59.70,00:04:59.70,double cheeseburgers?Absolutely.
75,00:05:02.10,00:05:02.10,But... I'm not right now.>> We got to get O.T.
76,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,fired up for this challenge.He's got to get fired up
77,00:05:09.57,00:05:09.57,like the first one.He was a madman.
78,00:05:11.93,00:05:11.93,He could have liftedthat cannon himself.
79,00:05:14.27,00:05:14.27,Every tribe mate has anobligation to the tribe
80,00:05:17.10,00:05:17.10,"that you have to check, youknow, your mental infirmities"
81,00:05:19.50,00:05:19.50,"at the door, get rid of those,and just suck it up"
82,00:05:21.97,00:05:21.97,"and do what you need to do.Really, for Osten, the key is"
83,00:05:25.20,00:05:25.20,mental stability and it's...it's something he's going
84,00:05:27.90,00:05:27.90,to struggle withhis entire time out here.
85,00:05:30.77,00:05:30.77,"So, I'm just going to doeverything I can to help the guy"
86,00:05:32.77,00:05:32.77,"out, to get him back to that...that awesome, larger-than-life"
87,00:05:36.13,00:05:36.13,individual he was when he set foot on this beach.
88,00:05:48.77,00:05:48.77,>> Everyone think we should golook for the treasure in the
89,00:05:50.63,00:05:50.63,"boat?>> Yeah, I'd love to find"
90,00:05:52.23,00:05:52.23,"the treasure.If it's got good, good,"
91,00:05:54.27,00:05:54.27,"goodies in it, like booze,a big bottle of rum."
92,00:05:57.53,00:05:57.53,(chuckles)>> After winning
93,00:06:00.63,00:06:00.63,"the first reward challenge,we got the first third"
94,00:06:03.50,00:06:03.50,"of our treasure map.We'll be heading east,"
95,00:06:05.97,00:06:05.97,"that way.It said, ""If you go"
96,00:06:09.00,00:06:09.00,"when the time is right""--and the only way time"
97,00:06:11.50,00:06:11.50,really affects thingsaround here is tide--
98,00:06:13.90,00:06:13.90,"so, it must mean something youcan only get to during low tide"
99,00:06:16.20,00:06:16.20,"or see during low tide.>> So, we took out the boat--"
100,00:06:24.97,00:06:24.97,we decided to go and lookfor big landmarks--
101,00:06:27.00,00:06:27.00,and we went around for...I don't know how long
102,00:06:30.13,00:06:30.13,we were out for.And it was hard because
103,00:06:32.47,00:06:32.47,"the more we were searching,the more possibilities"
104,00:06:35.33,00:06:35.33,we were coming up with.>> I want to find
105,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,that treasure so bad.What about right here?
106,00:06:44.07,00:06:44.07,It just eats me upthat there's a treasure
107,00:06:46.83,00:06:46.83,out therethat could have warm clothes
108,00:06:49.17,00:06:49.17,"or junk food or potato chipsor, I don't know,"
109,00:06:52.57,00:06:52.57,something in there.>> What about...
110,00:06:54.83,00:06:54.83,"is there something aroundthis way, too?"
111,00:06:56.33,00:06:56.33,>> There's probably more sandaround this way.
112,00:06:58.77,00:06:58.77,We're baffled right now.We've been searching
113,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,and searchingand haven't found the treasure
114,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,"yet, but we'll find it.It's going to take almost all of"
115,00:07:06.23,00:07:06.23,us to dig in this one part.>> I know.
116,00:07:09.03,00:07:09.03,>> Our tribe went outhalf-cocked.
117,00:07:10.90,00:07:10.90,"I played into thatfor awhile, too, until I "
118,00:07:12.80,00:07:12.80,started thinking about it.Pirates were not idiots and
119,00:07:16.70,00:07:16.70,people are not idiots.And you don't bury things in
120,00:07:18.80,00:07:18.80,the sand that you don't wantto be washed back up.
121,00:07:22.57,00:07:22.57,>> You guys just want usto dig up the whole island?
122,00:07:24.40,00:07:24.40,>> Sounds like it's about it.Kind of got a little discouraged
123,00:07:27.27,00:07:27.27,"and decided to, um, take abreak and check another time,"
124,00:07:30.07,00:07:30.07,"and hopefully get anotherpiece of the map today,"
125,00:07:33.17,00:07:33.17,so we can get that next clue.>> Tree mail.
126,00:07:40.70,00:07:40.70,">> Tree mail, tree mail, treemail!"
127,00:07:43.90,00:07:43.90,"""Ever get that sinking feelingthat you just can't stay"
128,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,afloat?Is it the fault of a lazy crew
129,00:07:49.93,00:07:49.93,or a problem with your boat?Should you bail out of
130,00:07:53.20,00:07:53.20,"trouble, or steer the other way,Will you get a good night's"
131,00:07:56.87,00:07:56.87,"sleep, will your possessionsgo away?"""
132,00:08:00.43,00:08:00.43,">> If we screw up on this one,they're gonna come"
133,00:08:02.63,00:08:02.63,and take whatever.>> Steal something else.
134,00:08:04.80,00:08:04.80,">> Right now, we need this win,I think, more than anything."
135,00:08:07.33,00:08:07.33,"When we read the tree mail,it was a reward for some"
136,00:08:10.13,00:08:10.13,"sleeping material.So, I'm assuming, like, blankets"
137,00:08:12.77,00:08:12.77,"and pillows and stuff like that.And then, we get to raid"
138,00:08:15.67,00:08:15.67,the other tribe's camp.>> I want is some clothes.
139,00:08:18.13,00:08:18.13,">> Oh, clothes? Yeah, child.>> A blanket."
140,00:08:20.90,00:08:20.90,>> If I have to be as coldas it was last night--
141,00:08:22.77,00:08:22.77,"I was freezing.>> Well, we alternated"
142,00:08:26.13,00:08:26.13,in thinking aboutis who's going to sit out.
143,00:08:28.10,00:08:28.10,">> If it... if it's physical,I'll sit out this one."
144,00:08:30.73,00:08:30.73,"If it's not, I won't.We're heading"
145,00:08:32.83,00:08:32.83,"into a reward challenge,so we have to think about who"
146,00:08:35.50,00:08:35.50,"we're going to sit out,because we are getting the"
147,00:08:38.23,00:08:38.23,"advantage over the Morgan Tribeand we will have to sit out,"
148,00:08:40.50,00:08:40.50,"you know, two people.If it happens to be"
149,00:08:42.57,00:08:42.57,"a swimming challenge,Sandra's not the best"
150,00:08:44.50,00:08:44.50,swimmer in the world.Sandra wouldn't be a bad one
151,00:08:46.17,00:08:46.17,"to do today,because the immunity"
152,00:08:48.63,00:08:48.63,could have swimming.>> So what makes you
153,00:08:50.63,00:08:50.63,a better swimmer than me?>> I'm not saying
154,00:08:52.53,00:08:52.53,that you can't swim!I'm just saying we want...
155,00:08:54.10,00:08:54.10,">> The day we jumped off theboat, where were you"
156,00:08:57.27,00:08:57.27,when I was already onshore?Still in the damn water.
157,00:09:01.03,00:09:01.03,"I said, ""When we jumped offthe boat the very first day,"
158,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,"I had already landed on shore.""He was still out there"
159,00:09:06.43,00:09:06.43,"doggy paddling.So, he's weaker than I am."
160,00:09:09.30,00:09:09.30,But he gets mad.He doesn't want to seem like
161,00:09:11.53,00:09:11.53,"he's the weakest one out here,which he is."
162,00:09:13.43,00:09:13.43,">> Okay, like, when wewere swimming to shore,"
163,00:09:15.57,00:09:15.57,"I had her glassesin my sock, I couldn't"
164,00:09:17.60,00:09:17.60,"kick my legs,so I swam with just my arms,"
165,00:09:20.47,00:09:20.47,"and how much did you beat me by,using your entire body to swim"
166,00:09:23.03,00:09:23.03,and me just using my arms?>> What day? What day?
167,00:09:25.03,00:09:25.03,">> Day one! Day one!Swimming from the boat,"
168,00:09:27.53,00:09:27.53,you beat me by so bad.How much did you beat me by?
169,00:09:29.27,00:09:29.27,>> Swimming to the boat?What are you talking about?
170,00:09:30.57,00:09:30.57,">> Swimming from the boat, whenwe jumped off the (clang) boat"
171,00:09:32.53,00:09:32.53,and we went to the shore.If you beat me so (clang) bad
172,00:09:35.40,00:09:35.40,"and I just used my arms,how bad did you beat me?"
173,00:09:38.23,00:09:38.23,">> You know what?I can get loud, too!"
174,00:09:40.40,00:09:40.40,"What the ...I can get loud, too!"
175,00:09:42.63,00:09:42.63,>> I don't want to (clang)argue with you.
176,00:09:44.13,00:09:44.13,That's why I'm (clang) from you.You're the one who wants
177,00:09:46.50,00:09:46.50,to fight.I walked away because she could
178,00:09:48.47,00:09:48.47,argue all day long.That's because she's foolish.
179,00:09:51.07,00:09:51.07,">> I can have a bigger mouth.>> Good, have the (clang) last"
180,00:09:53.87,00:09:53.87,word!That's all you (clang) want.
181,00:09:56.13,00:09:56.13,">> Well, then, be quiet,so that I can finish it."
182,00:09:58.53,00:09:58.53,"Screw Jon, 'cause he's an ass.Everything that comes out"
183,00:10:02.50,00:10:02.50,of his mouth is just ridiculous.>> Her days are numbered.
184,00:10:05.73,00:10:05.73,"We have bigger threats to getrid of first, but she's not one"
185,00:10:08.33,00:10:08.33,"of the final four.So... And I, and I got a mil"
186,00:10:12.43,00:10:12.43,that says she won't bethe final one.
187,00:10:23.43,00:10:23.43,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys.Okay, you guys ready"
188,00:10:27.07,00:10:27.07,for the challenge?>> Yes.

295,00:17:36.27,00:17:36.27,"Oh, I'm gone for good now.I think we started"
296,00:17:42.27,00:17:42.27,with three or four hooks.We're down to one.
297,00:17:46.07,00:17:46.07,There wasa blowfish in the water--
298,00:17:48.10,00:17:48.10,which I know you can't eat--and they're the ones
299,00:17:51.37,00:17:51.37,that kept taking my bait.And then I lost the hook.
300,00:17:57.63,00:17:57.63,>> How we doing?>> Great on blowfish.
301,00:18:01.37,00:18:01.37,They love me.I gave them breakfast.

303,00:18:09.27,00:18:09.27,even see anything else.And I lost the hook.
304,00:18:14.97,00:18:14.97,>> Seriously.You lost it on the rocks
305,00:18:21.27,00:18:21.27,"or something?>> No, they just took it."
306,00:18:25.10,00:18:25.10,"I had the fisherman,uh, knot on there,"
307,00:18:28.37,00:18:28.37,"and it was strong.>> I'm shocked, actually."

311,00:18:41.30,00:18:41.30,"a hook like that is two ways:either the line breaks,"
312,00:18:43.93,00:18:43.93,"which it didn't,or your knot wasn't secure,"
313,00:18:47.00,00:18:47.00,"which it wasn't.I don't know, man."
314,00:18:50.53,00:18:50.53,"We got to... We got to havea talk with Lill, I guess."
315,00:18:53.40,00:18:53.40,She's just not...>> She's not accepting of

319,00:19:04.13,00:19:04.13,about the whole issueof going fishing.

323,00:19:11.13,00:19:11.13,and I wasn'ttoo happy about it.

382,00:22:13.37,00:22:13.37,"so, you know, let them,uh, take the thing hot."
383,00:22:16.37,00:22:16.37,I don't care. Burn their hands.(chuckles)
384,00:22:25.00,00:22:25.00,Is there a boat coming?>> Who is it?

396,00:22:55.67,00:22:55.67,">> Did everyone fit on...?>> No, nobody could fit all"
397,00:22:57.23,00:22:57.23,"on the mattress.>> I use my buff, and I roll"
398,00:22:59.63,00:22:59.63,it up for my pillow at night.(Christa laughing)
399,00:23:02.83,00:23:02.83,">> You guys, I hate to,you know, cut it short."
400,00:23:05.43,00:23:05.43,I'm going to take the...your big old pot behind you.
401,00:23:09.40,00:23:09.40,">> It's hot.>> Yeah, watch your fingers,"
402,00:23:11.33,00:23:11.33,that's very hot.>> Thank God they had another
403,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,pot. Thank God.I would've felt horrible.
404,00:23:16.60,00:23:16.60,I don't even think I could havelooked at any of them
405,00:23:18.60,00:23:18.60,in the eyes when I left.>> They don't have any pots?
406,00:23:21.70,00:23:21.70,>> I don't know.>> It's really cool
407,00:23:24.40,00:23:24.40,"in your tribe, pretty much?or you got some...?"
408,00:23:27.90,00:23:27.90,">> Yeah, yeah. Everybody'sgetting along."
409,00:23:29.57,00:23:29.57,">> So, who's the leader?Do you, have a..."
410,00:23:32.93,00:23:32.93,"did you designate a...?>> Uh, nobody."
411,00:23:34.90,00:23:34.90,Everybody just kicks back.It's just the strangest thing.
412,00:23:37.00,00:23:37.00,It was just really hardbecause I was just put
413,00:23:40.20,00:23:40.20,so on the spot.I felt so under pressure--
414,00:23:42.57,00:23:42.57,"everybody was trying to hammerme with questions,"
415,00:23:44.67,00:23:44.67,and I was just trying to thinkof the right thing to say.
416,00:23:47.10,00:23:47.10,">> The first immunity challengeyou lose, who do you think's"
417,00:23:48.83,00:23:48.83,gone in your tribe?>> I have no idea.
418,00:23:51.10,00:23:51.10,"Well, that's the funny part...>> Come on."
419,00:23:52.97,00:23:52.97,">> No, I really don't.I really don't."
420,00:23:54.70,00:23:54.70,">> I mean, it doesn't matterif we know because we're not"
421,00:23:56.33,00:23:56.33,in your tribe.>> I know.
422,00:23:57.80,00:23:57.80,"I don't know, you guys.I didn't tell them anything."
423,00:24:01.00,00:24:01.00,"At least I was tryingnot to tell them anything,"
424,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73,and it was just really hard.It was overwhelming.
425,00:24:05.77,00:24:05.77,It was overwhelming.I just wanted
426,00:24:07.17,00:24:07.17,to get out of there.I just wanted to get
427,00:24:08.80,00:24:08.80,"out of there.You guys, it's been a pleasure."
428,00:24:10.53,00:24:10.53,"I'm sorry.Give me a hug, you guys."
429,00:24:12.67,00:24:12.67,>> It was nice meetingyou; you're sweet.
430,00:24:14.50,00:24:14.50,">> All right, you guys.>> Bye."
431,00:24:16.57,00:24:16.57,">> Later on, Ryan.Later on, Darrah."
432,00:24:18.53,00:24:18.53,">> I asked her,if they lose immunity,"
433,00:24:20.77,00:24:20.77,who gets voted out?Said she has no idea.
434,00:24:24.23,00:24:24.23,>> She's lying.Just think about it.
435,00:24:26.53,00:24:26.53,The girl's trying to be crafty.She ain't as dumb and dorky
436,00:24:28.47,00:24:28.47,as she's trying to play off.Her Big Bird-type personality
437,00:24:30.73,00:24:30.73,she's trying to portrayon us is ridiculous.
438,00:24:33.00,00:24:33.00,"It's a farce,it's a phony."
439,00:24:34.97,00:24:34.97,">> I think, right now,the Morgan Tribe, mentally,"
440,00:24:37.40,00:24:37.40,"is probably strongerthan the Drake Tribe,"
441,00:24:39.47,00:24:39.47,because we have experiencedso much defeat.
442,00:24:41.57,00:24:41.57,"You know, they've probablybeen sleeping better than us,"
443,00:24:43.17,00:24:43.17,probably have the sameamount of water.
444,00:24:45.10,00:24:45.10,They definitely have the sameamount of bug bites.
445,00:24:47.43,00:24:47.43,"But they have this euphoria, theadrenaline that naturally "
446,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,"results from winning,and that's huge out here."
447,00:24:53.40,00:24:53.40,We haven't had that yet.So I can't wait for Drake
448,00:24:55.87,00:24:55.87,to suffer some defeatand see if they just crumble.
449,00:25:16.23,00:25:16.23,">> Oh, baby. Oh, baby.This looks like a compass."
450,00:25:22.87,00:25:22.87,"We got mail, guys.Here's our flag."
451,00:25:26.07,00:25:26.07,>> How cool.That's awesome.
452,00:25:29.00,00:25:29.00,"Look at that thing.>> ""Your flag holds tribe pride,"

459,00:25:52.87,00:25:52.87,It indicated we should selectour smallest and our strongest.
460,00:25:56.00,00:25:56.00,"You the strongest?>> I hope so, yeah."
461,00:25:59.60,00:25:59.60,>> I agree.>> Yeah.
462,00:26:02.37,00:26:02.37,">> Osten has struggleda little bit, uh,"
463,00:26:06.03,00:26:06.03,psychologically in the lastcouple of days.

467,00:26:14.80,00:26:14.80,"is on your shoulders.>> Play it, don't say it."
468,00:26:17.47,00:26:17.47,>> All right.It says to choose your smallest.
469,00:26:19.43,00:26:19.43,"You're the smallest, right?>> I guess."
470,00:26:23.80,00:26:23.80,"We need to win this challengetoday bad, because going"
471,00:26:26.87,00:26:26.87,"to Tribal Council is not fun,and, you know, who wants"
472,00:26:29.63,00:26:29.63,"to vote off a member of yourown tribe, you know?"
473,00:26:32.23,00:26:32.23,And now we have sixand they have eight.
474,00:26:34.70,00:26:34.70,Sounds like a two-man show.>> We're down four.

478,00:26:53.73,00:26:53.73,You'll be bringing thosewith you to challenges.
479,00:26:55.60,00:26:55.60,"Okay, first things first.Thank you, Shawn."
480,00:27:01.03,00:27:01.03,Immunity back up for grabs.We talk a lot about
481,00:27:05.53,00:27:05.53,pulling your own weightin this game Survivor.
482,00:27:09.70,00:27:09.70,Today's challengeis going to put that notion
483,00:27:11.70,00:27:11.70,to the test literally.Dangling over the water are

492,00:27:34.00,00:27:34.00,on the people in the back untilonly Rupert and Osten remain.
493,00:27:37.03,00:27:37.03,"At that point,it becomes a showdown between "
494,00:27:39.37,00:27:39.37,"these final two tribe members.For the losers,"

570,00:32:58.03,00:32:58.03,"(applause)>> You know, after this"
571,00:33:26.07,00:33:26.07,"immunity challenge, you startthinking to yourselves, ""What"
572,00:33:28.77,00:33:28.77,"do we have to do to win?""This was different than"
573,00:33:32.07,00:33:32.07,"a couple of the others,because this, there's nothing"
574,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,else we could've done to win.I couldn't believe
575,00:33:38.53,00:33:38.53,you lasted that long.I thought it'd be...
576,00:33:40.87,00:33:40.87,five minutes.>> The weight of the world
577,00:33:44.73,00:33:44.73,"was on my shoulders for a day,and I didn't come up at the end."
578,00:33:48.53,00:33:48.53,I just didn't have the energyleft to hold it up.
579,00:33:50.90,00:33:50.90,"I was spent,my hands were chopped up,"
580,00:33:52.77,00:33:52.77,"and the rope just slipped...was slipping through my hands,"
581,00:33:55.37,00:33:55.37,so it was just a matter of time.>> Facing Tribal Council
582,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"the third time in a row is,uh, disheartening."
583,00:34:03.37,00:34:03.37,"It's one of us,and I don't want it to be me."
584,00:34:06.00,00:34:06.00,>> Who does more around camp?(laughs softly)
585,00:34:09.00,00:34:09.00,">> Um, well, of course.Her work ethic, she never quits."
586,00:34:13.00,00:34:13.00,Even when she could slack offif she wanted to.
587,00:34:15.93,00:34:15.93,>> Is there anything thatLill does that D can't?
588,00:34:18.30,00:34:18.30,">> That's what I'm saying,like, who can't do a fire?"
589,00:34:20.07,00:34:20.07,"Who can't go get water,day in and day out?"
590,00:34:22.97,00:34:22.97,">> Ryno, O.T. and myself and Thave... an alliance,"
591,00:34:26.90,00:34:26.90,I guess you would call it.So we're not going anywhere.
592,00:34:29.53,00:34:29.53,So it's either Darrah or Lill.Raw intelligence.
593,00:34:33.00,00:34:33.00,>> Raw intelligence.Her ability to think
594,00:34:34.73,00:34:34.73,outside the box.I haven't seen any of
595,00:34:37.47,00:34:37.47,"that from Darrah, tell you...tell you the truth."
596,00:34:39.33,00:34:39.33,"Not that it's not there, but...This is a critical vote--"
597,00:34:43.30,00:34:43.30,"we're down to six,we're gonna be down one more,"
598,00:34:45.77,00:34:45.77,"as of tonight.Clearly, Lill's up here--"
599,00:34:48.10,00:34:48.10,"contributes a hell of a lot morethan Darrah,"
600,00:34:50.53,00:34:50.53,"from what I can see at camp.In the challenges,"
601,00:34:53.13,00:34:53.13,Darrah's probably stronger.I don't think Lill could have
602,00:34:55.07,00:34:55.07,"done what Darrah did,being suspended in the tripod."
603,00:35:00.20,00:35:00.20,The person that is...least valuable to the tribe is
604,00:35:02.93,00:35:02.93,"the one that should go tonight,and whoever that is,"
605,00:35:05.87,00:35:05.87,"shouldn't have any problemwith it, because they should put"
606,00:35:08.50,00:35:08.50,the interests of the tribeahead of their own personal 
607,00:35:11.37,00:35:11.37,"interests.Now, that's a good theory..."
608,00:35:13.80,00:35:13.80,"(chuckles), but...How would you feel if you were"
609,00:35:18.20,00:35:18.20,"the one to go tonight?>> Very, very resentful."
610,00:35:22.63,00:35:22.63,">> Well, we'll have to havea conversation."
611,00:35:25.20,00:35:25.20,">> Well, you know what?>> I mean, it's a tough issue..."
612,00:35:27.43,00:35:27.43,">> Listen, I'm so glad you hadthe balls just to talk to me."
613,00:35:29.97,00:35:29.97,">> Oh, hell, either way, Lill,you've been an unbelievable "
614,00:35:32.43,00:35:32.43,asset to this tribe.The least you deserve is
615,00:35:35.47,00:35:35.47,"the brutal, honest truth.If it's not going your way,"
616,00:35:39.03,00:35:39.03,"I'll tell you.If it's going your way,"
617,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57,I'll tell you.>> I'm just looking at it
618,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43,that we need to win thenext challenge.
619,00:35:45.40,00:35:45.40,>> Right.I think what's been looked at is
620,00:35:47.57,00:35:47.57,the strength andweaknesses on both ends.
621,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"Just curious, um, if youthought more about it,"
622,00:35:53.07,00:35:53.07,or if it was a factor to beconcerned about or not or...
623,00:35:56.07,00:35:56.07,">> I mean, yeah, I want to say,too, but I'm not gonna go"
624,00:35:59.07,00:35:59.07,whine and mope around like she'sdoing.
625,00:36:02.53,00:36:02.53,">> Darrah and I, we walkedaround the cove."
626,00:36:04.67,00:36:04.67,"We talked about, basically,what's going on."
627,00:36:06.63,00:36:06.63,I let her know that...she potentially would be
628,00:36:08.50,00:36:08.50,"on the cutting block tonight,and she was pretty nonchalant"
629,00:36:11.27,00:36:11.27,about it.Which kind of concerns me.
630,00:36:14.40,00:36:14.40,"I don't know what that means.I could very well take it as,"
631,00:36:16.63,00:36:16.63,"does she care, or is she overlyconfident to know"
632,00:36:19.57,00:36:19.57,that that's not gonna happen?She didn't have anything
633,00:36:21.80,00:36:21.80,"to say, actually.>> Really? Did she say that"
634,00:36:23.60,00:36:23.60,she's stronger or...>> She didn't say anything.
635,00:36:26.13,00:36:26.13,>> You're kidding.Does Darrah think
636,00:36:28.37,00:36:28.37,she's not going anywhere?>> I have no clue.
637,00:36:31.33,00:36:31.33,>> Does Darrah deserve...has she earned her spot in our
638,00:36:33.93,00:36:33.93,tribe to make it anotherthree days?
639,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,I don't know.>> PROBST: Welcome to another
640,00:37:01.40,00:37:01.40,"windy Tribal Council.So, let's get to it."
641,00:37:04.67,00:37:04.67,"As of now, you're oneof the losingest tribes"
642,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,"ever, and with many morechallenges to go, chances are"
643,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,you may set a recordthat won't be broken.
644,00:37:13.93,00:37:13.93,"So, Tijuana, is the Drake tribesimply a better tribe?"
645,00:37:19.63,00:37:19.63,">> No, they're not.I think we have a better tribe."
646,00:37:22.27,00:37:22.27,"Um, we are very focused.It's just us coming together"
647,00:37:25.83,00:37:25.83,"when it comes timefor challenge time,"
648,00:37:27.83,00:37:27.83,"and we're not doing that.>> PROBST: Ryno, do you agree"
649,00:37:30.70,00:37:30.70,with that?Is this tribe really
650,00:37:32.20,00:37:32.20,"unified and focused?>> Yeah, I believe we're..."
651,00:37:36.40,00:37:36.40,we're pretty unified.It's just one of those
652,00:37:38.70,00:37:38.70,things right now.You got to get over a hump.
653,00:37:40.77,00:37:40.77,"You know,you're gonna get a win."
654,00:37:42.57,00:37:42.57,It's-it's inevitable.>> PROBST: Really?
655,00:37:45.57,00:37:45.57,">> I believe it's so.I mean, at our challenge,"
656,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,"Osten was the man-- I mean,I think we did great."
657,00:37:50.93,00:37:50.93,">> PROBST: Osten, are yousurprised at where this tribe"
658,00:37:53.57,00:37:53.57,is at?>> I feel still we have a lot
659,00:37:56.03,00:37:56.03,of fight left in this team;it's not over.
660,00:37:57.90,00:37:57.90,We still have a pulse;heart's still beating.
661,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,And everybody goesthrough a slump.
662,00:38:01.80,00:38:01.80,It's just the ability to comeout sooner than later.
663,00:38:04.47,00:38:04.47,">> PROBST: So, this is thething I don't get."
664,00:38:06.67,00:38:06.67,You guys don't seem worried.You haven't won a challenge.
665,00:38:10.03,00:38:10.03,"In fact, you've self-destructedat several challenges."
666,00:38:12.70,00:38:12.70,"And here you come and you're,like, ""Eh, you know what?"
667,00:38:14.73,00:38:14.73,"We'll get it together.It's a slump."""
668,00:38:16.33,00:38:16.33,>> Everyone's worried about it.There's nothing worse than
669,00:38:18.23,00:38:18.23,"going O-and-five,and it's demoralizing,"
670,00:38:21.37,00:38:21.37,"but the good news isthat we're all strong-willed,"
671,00:38:24.80,00:38:24.80,"and I predict,the next challenge,"
672,00:38:26.70,00:38:26.70,"we're gonna be on-on the top,on the winning side."
673,00:38:29.53,00:38:29.53,">> PROBST: Well, you know,four more Tribal Councils,"
674,00:38:31.77,00:38:31.77,"we have no tribe left.So, Tijuana, do you think about"
675,00:38:34.53,00:38:34.53,"""We got to dobetter challenges""?"
676,00:38:36.73,00:38:36.73,"Do you think about,""I need something to eat""?"
677,00:38:38.97,00:38:38.97,What's the overriding thoughtthat's going through your head
678,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,"out here right now?>> I think, overall,"
679,00:38:43.27,00:38:43.27,"um, just working together,understanding what our strengths"
680,00:38:45.40,00:38:45.40,"and weaknesses are,and how are we gonna stay"
681,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,"together as a team,no matter what."
682,00:38:49.90,00:38:49.90,">> PROBST: Darrah,you're living with"
683,00:38:51.97,00:38:51.97,virtually nothing.What areas are you
684,00:38:54.30,00:38:54.30,"uncomfortable with?>> Um, I guess not knowing"
685,00:38:56.37,00:38:56.37,"really how to build a fire,you know."
686,00:38:58.47,00:38:58.47,I'm not good at fires.That's Lill's job.
687,00:39:01.27,00:39:01.27,"But, you know, I put out my 110%at the challenges."
688,00:39:04.63,00:39:04.63,"Just like yesterday,I thought I was gonna die,"
689,00:39:07.40,00:39:07.40,but quitting neverwent through my mind.
690,00:39:10.23,00:39:10.23,">> PROBST: So, Lill,you got to feel pretty good"
691,00:39:12.03,00:39:12.03,about your place in this tribeand what you bring to it.
692,00:39:14.23,00:39:14.23,>> I'd like to think I'mvaluable.
693,00:39:16.70,00:39:16.70,"You know, I was never more proudwhen, um, Andrew said"
694,00:39:19.27,00:39:19.27,"that I had good work ethics,which I do."
695,00:39:24.67,00:39:24.67,"Now, hopefully,they'll look at that"
696,00:39:26.57,00:39:26.57,and consider thatwhen they're voting.
697,00:39:30.90,00:39:30.90,">> PROBST: It is time to vote. Ryno, you're up."
698,00:39:46.90,00:39:46.90,">> Lill, you're a great womanand a hard worker,"
699,00:39:50.30,00:39:50.30,and you contributedwell around camp.
700,00:40:02.23,00:40:02.23,">> Darrah, you are likethe Mississippi belle."
701,00:40:06.17,00:40:06.17,You're fragileand know very few skills.
702,00:40:10.33,00:40:10.33,"No hard feelings, honey.>> This is totally based"
703,00:40:26.43,00:40:26.43,upon a strategy.We'll see if it works.
704,00:40:34.67,00:40:34.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
705,00:40:46.53,00:40:46.53,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
706,00:40:49.27,00:40:49.27,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
707,00:40:51.07,00:40:51.07,Council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
708,00:40:56.33,00:40:56.33,First vote...Lill.
709,00:41:03.03,00:41:03.03,Darrah.Lill.
710,00:41:10.53,00:41:10.53,"That's two votes Lill,one vote Darrah."
711,00:41:15.03,00:41:15.03,Three votes Lill.Third person
712,00:41:20.07,00:41:20.07,voted out of the Morgan Tribe...Lill.
713,00:41:24.57,00:41:24.57,"That's four votes,that's enough."
714,00:41:26.43,00:41:26.43,"You need to bring me your torch.Lill, the tribe has spoken."
715,00:41:39.03,00:41:39.03,Try that again.They don't want you to go.
716,00:41:41.67,00:41:41.67,">> Yeah, right.>> PROBST: It's time for you"
717,00:41:46.43,00:41:46.43,"to go.Well, I don't think"
718,00:41:57.60,00:41:57.60,tonight's vote was easy.Don't give up on yourselves.
719,00:42:01.03,00:42:01.03,"Get your torches,head back to camp."
720,00:42:03.20,00:42:03.20,Good night.Stay tuned for scenes
721,00:42:23.27,00:42:23.27,from our next episode.Next time on Survivor...
722,00:42:28.73,00:42:28.73,"At Drake,winning has a downside."
723,00:42:30.57,00:42:30.57,>> A little more helpwould be appreciated.
724,00:42:32.40,00:42:32.40,>> It's starting to get annoyingbecause we really want somebody
725,00:42:34.47,00:42:34.47,to leave.>> At some point we should lose.
726,00:42:37.47,00:42:37.47,Can you do that?>> He's a traitor.
727,00:42:39.70,00:42:39.70,"If this was a pirate culture,he'd already be dead."
728,00:42:42.60,00:42:42.60,>> PROBST: And Osten's introuble.

730,00:42:45.70,00:42:45.70,>> PROBST: Hang on!>> My biggest regret is that
731,00:42:52.80,00:42:52.80,I didn't stay in longerto represent
732,00:42:55.20,00:42:55.20,my beautiful state of Ohio.It bothers me that our leader
733,00:42:59.30,00:42:59.30,"said he would get back to meafter I stated my case,"
734,00:43:02.67,00:43:02.67,and he didn't.Because it does seem to be
735,00:43:06.83,00:43:06.83,"a game of a lot of deceitand a lot of lying, and I'm not"
736,00:43:10.53,00:43:10.53,real good at that.
