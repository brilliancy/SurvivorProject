2,00:00:02.83,00:00:02.83,Survivor: 16 castaways began their adventure as four tribes.
3,00:00:06.67,00:00:06.67,"This is Exile Island. Throughout this game, tribe"
4,00:00:09.54,00:00:09.54,members will be banished to this island.
5,00:00:12.25,00:00:12.25,The tribes immediately faced off in their first reward
6,00:00:14.96,00:00:14.96,challenge. >> Yeah.
7,00:00:16.21,00:00:16.21,>> Let's get it on. >> PROBST: The losing tribe will
8,00:00:18.54,00:00:18.54,choose one person to stay behind on Exile Island right off the
9,00:00:23.88,00:00:23.88,"bat. In a race to find three amulets,"
10,00:00:28.04,00:00:28.04,"the older men, the younger men, and the older women were all"
11,00:00:31.38,00:00:31.38,winners. The young women finished last
12,00:00:34.67,00:00:34.67,"and chose Misty to stay behind. >> All right, I'm here."
13,00:00:39.21,00:00:39.21,>> PROBST: And a secret of Exile Island was revealed.
14,00:00:42.12,00:00:42.12,Hidden somewhere on this island is an immunity idol.
15,00:00:46.79,00:00:46.79,"Along the way, you'll be given clues as to the whereabouts of"
16,00:00:49.83,00:00:49.83,"that idol. At the older women's camp, Tina"
17,00:00:54.46,00:00:54.46,"emerged as a natural leader. >> Okay, here we go, kids."
18,00:00:58.25,00:00:58.25,Starting a fire was highly successful.
19,00:01:01.79,00:01:01.79,>> PROBST: The young men floundered.
20,00:01:03.46,00:01:03.46,>> That is the sorriest shelter I think we could have possibly
21,00:01:05.62,00:01:05.62,come up with. >> PROBST: And the younger women
22,00:01:07.50,00:01:07.50,struggled with indecision. >> Are you feeling it?
23,00:01:09.62,00:01:09.62,>> Next. >> I started to get a little
24,00:01:12.21,00:01:12.21,"bit frustrated with the whole, like, where we should do the"
25,00:01:15.08,00:01:15.08,shelter. >> PROBST: The older men thrived
26,00:01:17.17,00:01:17.17,>> That's the best-smelling stinking fire I've seen in a
27,00:01:19.71,00:01:19.71,"long time. >> PROBST: And Dan, the"
28,00:01:22.00,00:01:22.00,"astronaut, bonded with Terry, the fighter pilot."
29,00:01:24.21,00:01:24.21,>> I'll shake on that. >> PROBST: But Shane was on
30,00:01:26.12,00:01:26.12,edge. >> I smoke three packs of
31,00:01:27.92,00:01:27.92,"cigarettes a day, and I haven't had a cigarette in, like, 31"
32,00:01:31.08,00:01:31.08,hours. It is unbelievably hard.
33,00:01:36.38,00:01:36.38,">> PROBST: Alone on Exile Island, Misty toughed it out..."
34,00:01:39.96,00:01:39.96,">> I'm hungry. I'm really, really, really"
35,00:01:41.71,00:01:41.71,thirsty. >> PROBST: ...and made a plan.
36,00:01:43.29,00:01:43.29,">> When I see my tribe mates at the next immunity challenge,"
37,00:01:45.83,00:01:45.83,I'll trick them into thinking that I found the immunity idol.
38,00:01:49.08,00:01:49.08,>> PROBST: Misty returned to her tribe at the immunity challenge
39,00:01:53.38,00:01:53.38,and helped the younger women make a comeback.
40,00:01:56.50,00:01:56.50,Younger women have immunity. Older men win immunity.
41,00:02:03.12,00:02:03.12,Younger men win immunity. Older women going to Tribal
42,00:02:06.12,00:02:06.12,"Council. Before Tribal Council, Cirie"
43,00:02:09.29,00:02:09.29,knew she was in trouble. >> I'm really nervous.
44,00:02:12.00,00:02:12.00,I don't want to be the first one to go home.
45,00:02:14.88,00:02:14.88,>> PROBST: So she campaigned to have Tina voted out.
46,00:02:21.79,00:02:21.79,>> Whoa! >> PROBST: But when Tina found a
47,00:02:24.29,00:02:24.29,"fish, the decision was complicated."
48,00:02:26.83,00:02:26.83,>> I do think that Cirie is the weak link.
49,00:02:28.96,00:02:28.96,There are a hundred reasons to keep Tina.
50,00:02:32.71,00:02:32.71,>> PROBST: But at Tribal Council Tina ruffled feathers when she
51,00:02:35.04,00:02:35.04,criticized her tribe mates. Do you think these other three
52,00:02:38.21,00:02:38.21,are pulling their weight? >> Not as much as I would like.
53,00:02:40.75,00:02:40.75,">> No offense to Tina, but it's not like she's out there"
54,00:02:43.00,00:02:43.00,working and the three of us are taking a nap.
55,00:02:45.21,00:02:45.21,">> PROBST: In the end, Cirie got her wish when the older women"
56,00:02:48.04,00:02:48.04,voted off their strongest member.
57,00:02:50.29,00:02:50.29,"Tina, the tribe has spoken. 15 are left."
58,00:02:54.29,00:02:54.29,Who will be voted out tonight?  Captioning sponsored by

60,00:03:24.79,00:03:24.79,">> Yo, it's such a drag because shelter is somewhat useless"
61,00:03:28.21,00:03:28.21,because the way the rain is coming.
62,00:03:30.33,00:03:30.33,">> Yeah, how could we have known?"
63,00:03:37.12,00:03:37.12,">> Uh, well, the update is that we're in a torrential downpour."
64,00:03:41.58,00:03:41.58,"And our canopy wasn't completely built, so we rushed to try and"
65,00:03:46.04,00:03:46.04,"get the palm fronds on there, and we did it."
66,00:03:49.12,00:03:49.12,The problem is that the rain is coming in from the other side
67,00:03:52.21,00:03:52.21,"now, so a little bit of bad luck."
68,00:03:55.42,00:03:55.42,This place breeds bad luck. (thunder cracking)
69,00:04:32.21,00:04:32.21,">> Okay, we're getting close. It's going out."
70,00:04:42.33,00:04:42.33,>> That's no good. >> We don't have enough stuff
71,00:04:44.83,00:04:44.83,right here. >> I feel like I want to hammer
72,00:04:46.42,00:04:46.42,the freaking thing! (laughing)
73,00:04:52.83,00:04:52.83,">> Oh, shoot. >> I got it."
74,00:04:58.21,00:04:58.21,">> That's it, honey. Come on."
75,00:05:01.00,00:05:01.00,"Oh, it's ripe. Oh, we can eat this right now."
76,00:05:03.42,00:05:03.42,>> Almost. >> It's going to be so good.
77,00:05:06.38,00:05:06.38,That's just me stabbing it. >> You rock.
78,00:05:09.08,00:05:09.08,">> Nice job, girl. >> Yeah!"
79,00:05:12.33,00:05:12.33,>> Whoo! >> I'm so happy.
80,00:05:15.29,00:05:15.29,">> Ta-dah...! >> Mm, perfect."
81,00:05:18.25,00:05:18.25,>> Cheers. >> Salud.
82,00:05:20.12,00:05:20.12,>> Salud. Papaya love.
83,00:05:22.25,00:05:22.25,">> Papaya love. >> Sisters de bayoneta, our"
84,00:05:24.79,00:05:24.79,first papaya. >> Savor it.
85,00:05:30.58,00:05:30.58,>> I like it soft like that. It's really juicy.
86,00:05:33.67,00:05:33.67,">> Okay, this is just... I'm like, wow!"
87,00:05:38.71,00:05:38.71,>> Mm... >> Mm...
88,00:05:40.92,00:05:40.92,">> It's almost orgasmically wonderful, honestly."
89,00:05:43.12,00:05:43.12,>> Yeah! >> It's so good.
90,00:05:45.46,00:05:45.46,"Oh, it's like heaven. I'm about to cry."
91,00:05:48.50,00:05:48.50,We have food. >> It looks... it looks bad to
92,00:05:55.42,00:05:55.42,"the west, and it looks bad to the north."
93,00:06:02.12,00:06:02.12,">> You know, I think about everything that I'm missing"
94,00:06:04.25,00:06:04.25,right now. I think about my kid.
95,00:06:06.17,00:06:06.17,"I think about, you know, it's football practice, and we have"
96,00:06:10.12,00:06:10.12,"a game Saturday, and I miss him so much."
97,00:06:16.62,00:06:16.62,"I miss my kid a lot. I don't, you know, there's no..."
98,00:06:20.38,00:06:20.38,there's no reason for me to be doing this.
99,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,"Like, we are going... I mean, I more than enough money."
100,00:06:25.92,00:06:25.92,I don't know why I did this to myself.
101,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50,">> I don't like you, sand flea. I don't like flea!"
102,00:06:33.25,00:06:33.25,>> This whole scenario is so different from the way that I
103,00:06:36.79,00:06:36.79,"live my life. Like, my life is very busy and"
104,00:06:40.04,00:06:40.04,"it's always all the time, it's like constant, like ADD, you"
105,00:06:42.79,00:06:42.79,"know what I mean, psycho boy. But I'm just... I have a real"
106,00:06:46.25,00:06:46.25,hard time with the nothing-to-do part.
107,00:06:49.08,00:06:49.08,"I mean, there's plenty to do, but it's monotonous, and it's"
108,00:06:51.83,00:06:51.83,hard. It's hard.
109,00:06:57.00,00:06:57.00,"No more torrential downpours, sir God!"
110,00:07:02.42,00:07:02.42,"No more of those! >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."

126,00:08:15.12,00:08:15.12,"man. Therefore, ladies first."

193,00:11:39.17,00:11:39.17,six snakes throughout the entire course.
194,00:11:42.25,00:11:42.25,"On my ""go,"" you'll make your way to the first station, where"
195,00:11:44.58,00:11:44.58,you will collect your first two snakes.
196,00:11:47.04,00:11:47.04,"Once you have those, you'll crawl under a fence, over a"
197,00:11:50.17,00:11:50.17,12-foot A-frame wall. You'll make your way under the
198,00:11:53.08,00:11:53.08,"bamboo crawl, grab two more snakes."
199,00:11:55.88,00:11:55.88,You now have one person carrying four snakes.
200,00:11:58.88,00:11:58.88,You then go across a ladder bridge.
201,00:12:01.46,00:12:01.46,"If you fall off the bridge, you got to go back to the start"
202,00:12:03.67,00:12:03.67,"and go again. For the last phase, you go"
203,00:12:06.21,00:12:06.21,"through the water and into a pit of leaves, where you must find"
204,00:12:09.83,00:12:09.83,the last two snakes. First tribe to cross the finish
205,00:12:12.92,00:12:12.92,line with all six snakes wins reward.
206,00:12:15.71,00:12:15.71,You want to know what you're playing for?
207,00:12:17.25,00:12:17.25,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Fishing gear.
208,00:12:20.62,00:12:20.62,">> Beautiful! >> PROBST: In addition, waiting"
209,00:12:23.79,00:12:23.79,"for you at camp, one raft, four paddles to go with it."
210,00:12:27.50,00:12:27.50,Should help you trying to get some food.
211,00:12:29.67,00:12:29.67,Worth playing for? >> Yeah.
212,00:12:31.04,00:12:31.04,">> Definitely. >> PROBST: All right, let's take"
213,00:12:32.38,00:12:32.38,our spots. We'll get started.
214,00:12:40.25,00:12:40.25,"La Mina, who is going to be your snake wrangler?"
215,00:12:42.67,00:12:42.67,"Nick. For Casaya, Courtney."
216,00:12:45.67,00:12:45.67,"Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready?"
217,00:12:50.04,00:12:50.04,Go! Both tribes pushing people up
218,00:12:57.21,00:12:57.21,"quickly. You've got to get the untied,"
219,00:13:00.12,00:13:00.12,and one person is carrying them. Danielle and Courtney have the
220,00:13:04.17,00:13:04.17,first snake untied for Casaya. La Mina has their first snake.
221,00:13:11.12,00:13:11.12,Sally has the second snake for La Mina.
222,00:13:14.83,00:13:14.83,Both tribes have both snakes. Got to get everybody on the mat.
223,00:13:19.21,00:13:19.21,"La Mina, go! Casaya, go!"
224,00:13:25.29,00:13:25.29,Both tribes are dead even. When you have all seven over to
225,00:13:30.29,00:13:30.29,"the other side, you can go. >> Go, go, go!"
226,00:13:36.17,00:13:36.17,>> Go! >> PROBST: Carry those snakes.
227,00:13:39.04,00:13:39.04,"That a way. Casaya, go!"
228,00:13:43.71,00:13:43.71,Two more snakes to collect on your way through.
229,00:13:46.88,00:13:46.88,Both tribes pretty even. Both snakes are free for La
230,00:13:53.88,00:13:53.88,Mina. Both snakes are free for Casaya.
231,00:14:01.21,00:14:01.21,"La Mina, go! Casaya, go!"
232,00:14:05.67,00:14:05.67,">> Take your time. >> PROBST: Shane falls off,"
233,00:14:10.83,00:14:10.83,heads back to the start. This is going to be a challenge
234,00:14:14.04,00:14:14.04,for the snake wranglers. It's a lot to handle.
235,00:14:18.08,00:14:18.08,Nick's across. Move on!
236,00:14:22.42,00:14:22.42,Courtney's across. Go!
237,00:14:28.29,00:14:28.29,Last stage. We are neck and neck again.
238,00:14:31.88,00:14:31.88,Two snakes left buried in the leaves.
239,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,>> Got one! >> PROBST: Terry's got his hands
240,00:14:38.79,00:14:38.79,"on one. >> Got one, got one, got one."
241,00:14:42.75,00:14:42.75,>> PROBST: Aras has a snake for Casaya.
242,00:14:48.54,00:14:48.54,">> I got it, I got it! >> PROBST: Dan's released the"
243,00:14:50.38,00:14:50.38,sixth one for La Mina. They've got 'em all.
244,00:14:52.92,00:14:52.92,You got to get all six across the finish.
245,00:14:59.33,00:14:59.33,La Mina wins reward! >> Yeah!
246,00:15:13.12,00:15:13.12,">> PROBST: Casaya, you guys worked well together."
247,00:15:15.17,00:15:15.17,I don't even think you were out-hustled.
248,00:15:16.83,00:15:16.83,You just loss. I got nothing for you.
249,00:15:19.00,00:15:19.00,"You're heading back to the Casaya beach, previously the"
250,00:15:21.12,00:15:21.12,older women's camp. Head on out.
251,00:15:24.17,00:15:24.17,"La Mina, nice effort, won yourself a nice reward."
252,00:15:27.46,00:15:27.46,"Come get it, head on out, heading to the older men's camp."
253,00:15:44.62,00:15:44.62,">> It looks like a nice camp. >> Yeah, this camp is so much"
254,00:15:48.25,00:15:48.25,nicer than ours. We didn't stop working.
255,00:16:04.04,00:16:04.04,I'm in a much better mood than I was this morning.
256,00:16:07.29,00:16:07.29,I've always related better with younger people.
257,00:16:09.08,00:16:09.08,"I'm 34, but I'm definitely young for my age in the way"
258,00:16:11.62,00:16:11.62,"that I think about life. When I was at the older tribe,"
259,00:16:14.04,00:16:14.04,I was thinking about every single minute about when I was
260,00:16:16.25,00:16:16.25,"gonna be leaving. Here I haven't thought about,"
261,00:16:21.12,00:16:21.12,"you know what I mean, I haven't thought about leaving"
262,00:16:22.75,00:16:22.75,yet. >> Do you all want to see your
263,00:16:26.00,00:16:26.00,new home? >> We have not been wet at all.
264,00:16:29.04,00:16:29.04,>> I'm so impressed. Why?
265,00:16:30.83,00:16:30.83,This is how we made ours. >> Wow!
266,00:16:33.21,00:16:33.21,">> You see this, Bob? >> We can add a little bit more"
267,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,"on this side to make it wider, maybe."
268,00:16:37.58,00:16:37.58,>> How are the bugs? >> Not bad.
269,00:16:40.00,00:16:40.00,">> You guys, this is definitely the best spot for that."
270,00:16:42.21,00:16:42.21,">> You guys are awesome, man! >> It's so great."
271,00:16:46.62,00:16:46.62,We're going to have fun. >> This is so much better.
272,00:16:49.17,00:16:49.17,"I'm so excited. >> Oh, my God."
273,00:16:51.88,00:16:51.88,We have been invaded. >> Fire!
274,00:16:55.75,00:16:55.75,"Way to go, way to go, way to go. I like our name."
275,00:16:59.79,00:16:59.79,I like our color. I like our people.
276,00:17:02.42,00:17:02.42,"First and foremost... >> I mean, some of the people,"
277,00:17:06.12,00:17:06.12,"like Danielle, she's okay, and Courtney, like, I mean, you"
278,00:17:09.21,00:17:09.21,"know, like, she, like... >> I'm, like..."
279,00:17:12.25,00:17:12.25,"I'm, like, gangster Hollywood, man."
280,00:17:15.88,00:17:15.88,"I'm like near like Playboy, liquor and stuff."
281,00:17:18.04,00:17:18.04,"I'm, like, where the Hill starts to rise, you know?"
282,00:17:21.38,00:17:21.38,I can walk to Avalon. >> It's like that game where
283,00:17:25.58,00:17:25.58,"you have to figure out what doesn't belong in a group, and"
284,00:17:29.67,00:17:29.67,Cirie and I are the ones that stick out.
285,00:17:33.12,00:17:33.12,>> it's so fun having so many more people.
286,00:17:34.38,00:17:34.38,>> It's fun for me having girls around.
287,00:17:36.12,00:17:36.12,I like having girls around. >> If our tribe loses the
288,00:17:38.62,00:17:38.62,"coming-up immunity challenge, I think Cirie and I are screwed."
289,00:17:46.12,00:17:46.12,"Yep, we're screwed. >> I just have to get the"
290,00:17:52.08,00:17:52.08,heat and now I'm happy. >> What?
291,00:17:54.67,00:17:54.67,">> Yo, you, it's the three of us."
292,00:17:56.67,00:17:56.67,It's the three of us and Aras. >> Totally.
293,00:17:59.12,00:17:59.12,>> The four of us. >> Here's the deal.
294,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,Can we not make it dramatic and like cheat on each other
295,00:18:04.79,00:18:04.79,"five people in, just the four of us go to the four, done?"
296,00:18:08.46,00:18:08.46,No more discussion about it. If I just can get through this
297,00:18:11.50,00:18:11.50,"part, which is the surviving, and do well in the challenges,"
298,00:18:15.00,00:18:15.00,"we're going to be fine. I got on the beach, and I was"
299,00:18:17.62,00:18:17.62,"right there. I was like here it is, you,"
300,00:18:20.04,00:18:20.04,"you, you, you, let's lock in right now."
301,00:18:23.83,00:18:23.83,You've just been welcomed into the group.
302,00:18:27.08,00:18:27.08,I swear to you on my son's life...
303,00:18:29.50,00:18:29.50,"It's us four. >> Yeah, totally, 100%."
304,00:18:37.29,00:18:37.29,">> For Shane, the first five minutes we were there, he was"
305,00:18:41.83,00:18:41.83,"just like, ""us four."" me, Shane, Aras and Courtney."
306,00:18:46.38,00:18:46.38,The people that don't talk and communicate and see what's
307,00:18:48.79,00:18:48.79,going on and see how people are feeling and look people in
308,00:18:51.12,00:18:51.12,"the eye, they're the ones who get voted off."
309,00:18:55.17,00:18:55.17,">> No way! >> Oh, my God!"
310,00:18:58.79,00:18:58.79,>> This is so awesome. >> This is really nice.
311,00:19:02.08,00:19:02.08,">> Let's make sure we get some poles, though."
312,00:19:03.92,00:19:03.92,I am thrilled with this outcome. It was a close call for me.
313,00:19:07.12,00:19:07.12,"I was the 15th guy picked, but Ruth Marie did pick me, and this"
314,00:19:11.25,00:19:11.25,was the team I definitely wanted to be on.
315,00:19:14.08,00:19:14.08,">> Oh, fire! It feels so good."
316,00:19:18.33,00:19:18.33,Thank you so much for letting us come here.
317,00:19:20.75,00:19:20.75,>> Terry and I have a fantastic relationship and a strategy
318,00:19:24.00,00:19:24.00,that's going to take us all the way.
319,00:19:26.12,00:19:26.12,So it's great. >> Dan and I were talking that
320,00:19:33.04,00:19:33.04,"we'd like to make a bond with you guys, look each other in the"
321,00:19:36.96,00:19:36.96,"eye, shake hands, and say, you know, we're going to do our"
322,00:19:41.12,00:19:41.12,"best to get everyone to the merge, but if we have to start"
323,00:19:43.88,00:19:43.88,dropping people it's not going to be one of us four guys.
324,00:19:47.04,00:19:47.04,">> It's in our best interest, probably."
325,00:19:49.33,00:19:49.33,">> You have my word, you know, you have my word, definitely."
326,00:19:52.25,00:19:52.25,>> What do you think? >> It makes a lot of sense.
327,00:19:54.33,00:19:54.33,Terry just laid it out there. He said him and Dan are together
328,00:19:56.96,00:19:56.96,and they want Austin and I with them.
329,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,"I think that him and Dan are both strong players, both in the"
330,00:20:01.62,00:20:01.62,challenges and around camp. >> It's done.
331,00:20:03.67,00:20:03.67,">> Okay, thanks a lot, man. >> Trust you, and I need you."
332,00:20:05.83,00:20:05.83,">> I trust you and I need you. If we're gonna do this, I need"
333,00:20:07.88,00:20:07.88,"you. >> We're gonna do this, all"
334,00:20:09.17,00:20:09.17,right. >> It makes sense for the short
335,00:20:10.38,00:20:10.38,term in the tribe. The four of us really have
336,00:20:12.29,00:20:12.29,nothing to worry about with the majority over the three women.
337,00:20:14.50,00:20:14.50,"But, I don't know, you never know what's going to happen."
338,00:20:17.46,00:20:17.46,>> So let's talk strategy for a minute.
339,00:20:20.21,00:20:20.21,"I talked to Misty a little bit, and we were thinking if the"
340,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,"four of us stuck together, meaning you and Nick, we would"
341,00:20:29.75,00:20:29.75,"have the numbers, and then it feels kind of even because it's"
342,00:20:32.42,00:20:32.42,"you know, two girls, two guys, and we can figure it out from"
343,00:20:34.79,00:20:34.79,"there, you know? We would definitely want to vote"
344,00:20:38.88,00:20:38.88,with you guys if you wanted to. >> Okay.
345,00:20:41.04,00:20:41.04,">> So talk to Nick when you can. >> All right, I will."
346,00:20:43.71,00:20:43.71,Cool. It is definitely Austin and
347,00:20:46.33,00:20:46.33,Nick in the middle right now. We are right in the middle of a
348,00:20:48.88,00:20:48.88,tug-of-war. It lets me know that this game
349,00:20:50.88,00:20:50.88,is serious. This isn't just all fun and
350,00:20:52.79,00:20:52.79,games. Somebody is going to have to
351,00:20:54.21,00:20:54.21,"get hurt out here. >> ""Clue one, day one."
352,00:21:09.71,00:21:09.71,You also have a lot of time to think about why fate chose
353,00:21:14.08,00:21:14.08,"you to be the first one out here."""
354,00:21:16.88,00:21:16.88,"""Clue two, it is above the tide line."""
355,00:21:20.54,00:21:20.54,I read the clue. The clue just showed me a
356,00:21:24.12,00:21:24.12,little section where the idol is not.
357,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,Also it said it's above the tide mark.
358,00:21:31.00,00:21:31.00,So I figured right against the cliff someplace.
359,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50,"I'm going to be ripping this island apart, and I'm going to"
360,00:21:36.92,00:21:36.92,find that immunity idol. That's where I'm going to put
361,00:21:39.21,00:21:39.21,"most of my energy, after I get the fire set up."
362,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,"And it's a little bit miserable. Inconvenience, that's all it is."
363,00:21:50.17,00:21:50.17,(murmuring) It's all worn out.
364,00:22:06.42,00:22:06.42,(yells) >> My practice will
365,00:22:08.67,00:22:08.67,"really help me clear my mind, focus, get my mind ready, like"
366,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,for battle. And then I get my mind ready
367,00:22:15.38,00:22:15.38,the same way to be on this island.
368,00:22:25.75,00:22:25.75,">> This place is, like, horrible, evil..."
369,00:22:29.71,00:22:29.71,It's like not good to be here. I would not wish this on my
370,00:22:33.12,00:22:33.12,worst enemy. (thunderclap)
371,00:22:46.12,00:22:46.12,">> All right, I'm gonna go catch us dinner."
372,00:22:48.83,00:22:48.83,>> Are you going to do the spear and the goggles?
373,00:22:50.88,00:22:50.88,>> I never used one of those. >> I haven't either.
374,00:22:52.88,00:22:52.88,We'll have to experiment with that a little bit.
375,00:22:54.88,00:22:54.88,">> Yeah, let's play with it. >> At the reward challenge, we"
376,00:22:58.42,00:22:58.42,"won fishing gear: spear gun, hooks, tackle, a couple of drop"
377,00:23:02.62,00:23:02.62,"lines, fins and a mask and the raft."
378,00:23:06.75,00:23:06.75,So it's pretty exciting. It will be nice to get out
379,00:23:09.42,00:23:09.42,there and bring in some fish for everybody.
380,00:23:12.12,00:23:12.12,"Just point at the fish, hopefully, and there you go."
381,00:23:15.12,00:23:15.12,>> That's kind of fun. >> Just remember to hold on to
382,00:23:17.71,00:23:17.71,it. >> I saw some fish just right
383,00:23:22.71,00:23:22.71,over there. Look at them!
384,00:23:25.58,00:23:25.58,>> That's amazing. Should we toss in a line?
385,00:23:27.38,00:23:27.38,>> Let's just see what it's like down here.
386,00:23:29.21,00:23:29.21,">> Yeah, might as well. We've paddled enough."
387,00:23:37.33,00:23:37.33,"I was sitting on the edge of the raft, and I decided I'm"
388,00:23:40.67,00:23:40.67,"going to try the spear, and I'm like, oh, this will be a"
389,00:23:43.25,00:23:43.25,practice shot. So you...
390,00:23:45.92,00:23:45.92,Oh! >> Uh-oh.
391,00:23:53.08,00:23:53.08,">> The first time I attempted to use that stupid spear, it flew"
392,00:23:57.29,00:23:57.29,"off my arm, and I dove down, and it was so deep."
393,00:24:02.21,00:24:02.21,>> Any sign of it? >> I should have stuck to what
394,00:24:05.62,00:24:05.62,I knew. >> That's all right.
395,00:24:07.92,00:24:07.92,"Is it down 30, 40 feet, probably?"
396,00:24:10.00,00:24:10.00,">> I can't see anything. >> Don't, like, stress out."
397,00:24:12.00,00:24:12.00,"Don't, like, hurt yourself. >> Nick was cool about it."
398,00:24:22.08,00:24:22.08,"He was like just don't worry about it, but I was really"
399,00:24:24.12,00:24:24.12,nervous to come back and tell the rest of the tribe.
400,00:24:26.08,00:24:26.08,I have some bad news. >> What?
401,00:24:28.96,00:24:28.96,>> I lost that spear. It was so... it was stupid.
402,00:24:33.92,00:24:33.92,>> Did it fall over or something or fell through?
403,00:24:36.42,00:24:36.42,>> I'm so sorry. >> Did you try to go back with
404,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,"the mask? >> It was so deep, I couldn't"
405,00:24:40.42,00:24:40.42,"get down there. >> We were out about 100 yards,"
406,00:24:44.29,00:24:44.29,"probably 30, 40 feet of water. >> I was very frustrated about"
407,00:24:48.08,00:24:48.08,the spear. I have no doubt in my mind we
408,00:24:50.71,00:24:50.71,would be eating tons of fish if we had that spear.
409,00:24:53.25,00:24:53.25,>> I lost our spear. I feel terrible.
410,00:24:55.79,00:24:55.79,>> Don't worry. We'll make... We can make one.
411,00:25:06.29,00:25:06.29,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Okay, how is everybody doing?"
412,00:25:18.38,00:25:18.38,"Misty, how're you hanging in there?"
413,00:25:20.38,00:25:20.38,>> Pretty good. The good part about our team is
414,00:25:22.38,00:25:22.38,we're all very upbeat. And that's kind of our rule:
415,00:25:24.38,00:25:24.38,Don't get down and out; just be thankful and stay positive.
416,00:25:26.38,00:25:26.38,">> PROBST: Casaya, how are things going for you?"
417,00:25:28.38,00:25:28.38,">> I don't know how people want to feel about stuff, but"
418,00:25:30.38,00:25:30.38,I'm not gonna lie. We are in a dire situation.
419,00:25:32.38,00:25:32.38,"And you know, the whole like ""Ooh, let's act like we're"
420,00:25:35.38,00:25:35.38,"doing all right, so the other tribe thinks we're..."""
421,00:25:38.83,00:25:38.83,"You know what I mean? Screw that, we are not in a"
422,00:25:41.79,00:25:41.79,"good way. Physically, we're wrecked."
423,00:25:47.08,00:25:47.08,">> PROBST: Okay, let's get to today's challenge."
424,00:25:50.17,00:25:50.17,Here's how it works: today's immunity challenge will test
425,00:25:52.88,00:25:52.88,your ability to work together while transporting a giant
426,00:25:56.08,00:25:56.08,zombie head from the ocean to the beach.
427,00:25:59.67,00:25:59.67,Each tribe has a boat. That boat is anchored to the
428,00:26:02.83,00:26:02.83,bottom of the ocean floor with a large wooden box.
429,00:26:06.00,00:26:06.00,"In addition, each boat has six holes, filled with rubber plugs."
430,00:26:11.12,00:26:11.12,"On my ""Go,"" five tribe members pull out the plugs and begin"
431,00:26:15.00,00:26:15.00,bailing the water that is now coming in the boat.
432,00:26:17.88,00:26:17.88,"The other two tribe members jump into the water, start"
433,00:26:20.67,00:26:20.67,"moving the boat forward by pulling the anchor, which is"
434,00:26:23.58,00:26:23.58,"very heavy. Once you get to shore, clip"
435,00:26:26.08,00:26:26.08,your boat into the hitching post.
436,00:26:27.96,00:26:27.96,You must now transport the anchor up the beach to your
437,00:26:31.58,00:26:31.58,finish mat. The first tribe to get their
438,00:26:34.25,00:26:34.25,"zombie head on the zombie body wins immunity, safe from Tribal"
439,00:26:37.21,00:26:37.21,"Council. Losers, somebody going home"
440,00:26:39.21,00:26:39.21,tonight; big enough stakes? >> Yes.
441,00:26:40.96,00:26:40.96,">> PROBST: Swim out, we'll get started."
442,00:26:47.21,00:26:47.21,For immunity... Survivors ready?
443,00:26:52.08,00:26:52.08,Go! Aras in the water for Casaya.
444,00:26:55.88,00:26:55.88,Bobby's right behind. Going to have to work together
445,00:27:04.21,00:27:04.21,to keep that water out of the boat!
446,00:27:10.04,00:27:10.04,Terry and Nick in the water for La Mina.
447,00:27:25.71,00:27:25.71,Casaya's going backwards. Nick and Austin going to switch
448,00:27:29.42,00:27:29.42,it up for La Mina. >> PROBST: Bobby and Shane
449,00:27:43.79,00:27:43.79,swapping out for Casaya. Shane made zero progress in the
450,00:27:54.79,00:27:54.79,water. La Mina still in the lead but
451,00:27:57.58,00:27:57.58,only because Casaya is absolutely inept.
452,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,Casaya switching out members again.
453,00:28:10.08,00:28:10.08,>> You take the back. I'll take the front.
454,00:28:21.88,00:28:21.88,>> PROBST: Casaya making up some ground.
455,00:28:24.08,00:28:24.08,">> Go, let's go! >> PROBST: Casaya getting"
456,00:28:26.08,00:28:26.08,"closer. La Mina, got to pick it up!"
457,00:28:35.04,00:28:35.04,Terry pulling that anchor in. La Mina's first back to the
458,00:28:38.58,00:28:38.58,beach. Casaya not giving up.
459,00:28:44.08,00:28:44.08,Get that anchor to the shore. Get that boat clipped in.
460,00:28:47.75,00:28:47.75,>> Pull! >> PROBST: The boat is stuck.
461,00:28:50.88,00:28:50.88,La Mina trying to muscle it in. Still a few inches short.
462,00:28:55.96,00:28:55.96,Casaya starting to close the gap.
463,00:28:58.79,00:28:58.79,Misty's got it clipped! The boat is done.
464,00:29:02.25,00:29:02.25,Get the anchor to the finish mat.
465,00:29:04.33,00:29:04.33,">> Pull. >> Come on, come on!"
466,00:29:06.42,00:29:06.42,">> Come on, hurry! (indistinct shouts)"
467,00:29:16.50,00:29:16.50,>> PROBST: Casaya still has a shot.
468,00:29:19.33,00:29:19.33,La Mina very close. (indistinct shouts)
469,00:29:26.12,00:29:26.12,You're good. Get the head on the body for
470,00:29:28.75,00:29:28.75,immunity. >> Get closer.
471,00:29:32.25,00:29:32.25,>> You got it. >> PROBST: La Mina wins
472,00:29:34.25,00:29:34.25,immunity! (cheering)
473,00:29:38.29,00:29:38.29,"(muttering) La Mina, immunity."
474,00:29:47.46,00:29:47.46,>> Whoo-whoo! >> PROBST: No Tribal Council.
475,00:29:50.04,00:29:50.04,"Congratulations. Casaya, Tribal Council tonight."
476,00:29:53.92,00:29:53.92,It's going to cost you a member. You have the afternoon to
477,00:29:56.29,00:29:56.29,figure out who that's going to be.
478,00:29:57.96,00:29:57.96,See you at Tribal tonight. >> Whenever there's a
479,00:30:23.29,00:30:23.29,"competition of any sort, I don't like to lose, you know, I just,"
480,00:30:26.92,00:30:26.92,"uh, I hate to lose anything. I'm beat. I'm wiped-out."
481,00:30:30.29,00:30:30.29,I want a cigarette. I want a coffee.
482,00:30:33.08,00:30:33.08,I want to have a big sandwich. I want to call my kid.
483,00:30:35.42,00:30:35.42,I want to tell him I love him and this is just the stupidest
484,00:30:37.71,00:30:37.71,thing I ever did in my whole life.
485,00:30:40.04,00:30:40.04,I am not well without him. I'm not well without him.
486,00:30:50.17,00:30:50.17,">> Shane, what are you doing? >> It's not what I'm doing or"
487,00:30:53.54,00:30:53.54,"what I'm not doing. I'm telling you, I can't finish."
488,00:30:56.67,00:30:56.67,I'm gonna quit. I have to quit. >> Come on.
489,00:30:59.67,00:30:59.67,">> It only gets better from here, we're gonna win food..."
490,00:31:01.67,00:31:01.67,">> Really, just give it a chance, please."
491,00:31:04.79,00:31:04.79,Don't fall down on this moment. >> What's up?
492,00:31:08.04,00:31:08.04,>> He's just not feeling so good right now.
493,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,">> Emotionally? Physically? >> I just, you know, I don't"
494,00:31:13.54,00:31:13.54,"want to be here anymore. Like, I really just want you"
495,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,guys to vote me off. >> That's nuts.
496,00:31:19.12,00:31:19.12,">> We need you, man. I mean, you're dropping on us,"
497,00:31:22.08,00:31:22.08,"too, you know that, right? >> I'm not dropping on you guys."
498,00:31:24.29,00:31:24.29,">> Yeah, you are. Shane is letting us down"
499,00:31:26.83,00:31:26.83,"completely. He's leaving us high and dry,"
500,00:31:29.67,00:31:29.67,and I just feel like he snapped today and threw in the towel.
501,00:31:33.17,00:31:33.17,"I mean, it's just like, come on, man, pick it up!"
502,00:31:53.29,00:31:53.29,>> Where is he? >> Just when we thought it was
503,00:31:55.67,00:31:55.67,"over, Shane wants to quit. Aahh!"
504,00:32:00.04,00:32:00.04,You have people begging to stay here.
505,00:32:03.58,00:32:03.58,"If somebody wants to quit, let him quit."
506,00:32:06.79,00:32:06.79,">> So you, basically this is what'll happen."
507,00:32:09.21,00:32:09.21,"You're gonna, you know, we're gonna be here."
508,00:32:11.08,00:32:11.08,We're going to have water. And we're going to have food
509,00:32:14.58,00:32:14.58,"tomorrow, you'll be set. And we'll be eating not like a"
510,00:32:16.58,00:32:16.58,champion... >> I don't want to be here.
511,00:32:19.75,00:32:19.75,>> Are you sure? >> I'm positive. I'm positive.
512,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,"I'm sorry. >> Shane, come back here."
513,00:32:25.21,00:32:25.21,You-You know that thought was in your head.
514,00:32:28.21,00:32:28.21,">> I just don't want to, like, if I get hydrated, and I get"
515,00:32:30.21,00:32:30.21,food... >> Just try it. Okay?
516,00:32:43.83,00:32:43.83,>> Okay. All right. >> Just 'cause it's not like I
517,00:32:45.67,00:32:45.67,"can do anything. >> I know, but..."
518,00:32:51.21,00:32:51.21,>> We can just bring it up right now.
519,00:32:55.00,00:32:55.00,"Hey, guys, I hate to be the one to bring this up..."
520,00:32:58.50,00:32:58.50,">> Oh, no. >> But Shane wants to stay."
521,00:33:00.88,00:33:00.88,"He doesn't want to go home. >> I'm really sorry about my,"
522,00:33:04.46,00:33:04.46,"like, insanity flip-flop today. It's like there's no reason why"
523,00:33:08.04,00:33:08.04,I shouldn't try and stay. I haven't had water in two days.
524,00:33:11.67,00:33:11.67,"It's like, if I drink, I might feel better in my brain and in"
525,00:33:14.79,00:33:14.79,"my head, and I might want to stay, you know what I mean?"
526,00:33:17.54,00:33:17.54,So like... >> And so now we have to talk
527,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,about who we're going to vote off.
528,00:33:23.67,00:33:23.67,"So, I'm... I just want to do this with honesty and like"
529,00:33:27.12,00:33:27.12,"openness, and-and where I stand here is, like, I want our tribe"
530,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,to be as physically strong as possible.
531,00:33:33.67,00:33:33.67,"So, I think, like, for me, I per... and this is nothing"
532,00:33:39.04,00:33:39.04,"against you two, either one, but I'm going to throw my vote"
533,00:33:42.25,00:33:42.25,either with you or you. And I haven't decided yet.
534,00:33:44.50,00:33:44.50,"Cirie, you're looking at me like you hate me, and I..."
535,00:33:46.75,00:33:46.75,">> No, I just don't... What do you want me..."
536,00:33:48.75,00:33:48.75,I don't know what to say about that.
537,00:33:55.12,00:33:55.12,">> Well, since you just dropped this bomb on here, seriously..."
538,00:33:57.12,00:33:57.12,>> I just wanted... I just wanted to put it out there.
539,00:33:59.12,00:33:59.12,">> Jason just dropped a huge bomb, like, boom!"
540,00:34:02.04,00:34:02.04,>> I don't want anyone to show up at Tribal Council and have
541,00:34:04.04,00:34:04.04,their back stabbed. >> Aras literally came over to
542,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,"the shelter, not having spoken to anyone about what he was"
543,00:34:09.79,00:34:09.79,"about to do, and he said, ""Cirie or Melinda are going to go home"
544,00:34:12.75,00:34:12.75,"tonight."" It was so stupid."
545,00:34:16.12,00:34:16.12,"And it was his decision. He just came over and was like,"
546,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,"""Boop!"" >> There's been an arrangement"
547,00:34:21.46,00:34:21.46,obviously made. What he said sounded insincere.
548,00:34:23.50,00:34:23.50,"I don't know what to tell you. Like, I don't care which one of"
549,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83,you goes. You know what I mean?
550,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,"I just don't... Like, whoever doesn't go now"
551,00:34:30.67,00:34:30.67,"is going next. >> And then Shane piped in, you"
552,00:34:34.42,00:34:34.42,"know, that yeah, it's the four of us, like literally just said"
553,00:34:38.50,00:34:38.50,right out loud that we have an alliance.
554,00:34:41.04,00:34:41.04,You don't let... You don't tell everyone what's
555,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,going on. If this total instability
556,00:34:46.46,00:34:46.46,"continues, it's going to be very hard to know that he will"
557,00:34:49.92,00:34:49.92,be there for us. >> We're screwed.
558,00:34:59.08,00:34:59.08,"I think it's me. I think it's me, and whatever."
559,00:35:02.83,00:35:02.83,There's nothing I can do right now.
560,00:35:05.96,00:35:05.96,I'm going to stop... (mumbles.) >> I don't know who's going to
561,00:35:10.62,00:35:10.62,go first. Cirie seems to think she'll go
562,00:35:12.79,00:35:12.79,"first, but I-I'm not so sure that it won't be me."
563,00:35:15.96,00:35:15.96,>> I... I feel so awful. I don't like this.
564,00:35:20.38,00:35:20.38,">> (crying): Yeah, there's a lot about it that's not fair."
565,00:35:24.17,00:35:24.17,There really is. I was the last one picked of
566,00:35:28.21,00:35:28.21,"our group, so that's one reason that I think it might be me."
567,00:35:32.21,00:35:32.21,"And I'm not all, ""Ooh, meditative, cool, yeah."""
568,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,"That's just not me. >> I mean, it's one or the"
569,00:35:44.00,00:35:44.00,other at this point. Cirie and Melinda are going to
570,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,"go one-two, whatever, you know. They're the first two to go."
571,00:35:49.04,00:35:49.04,The thing I don't feel safe about is my brain giving up.
572,00:35:53.12,00:35:53.12,"Like, I have this part of me that wants to go into Tribal"
573,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,"Council tonight and just say, ""Listen, cut me out, because"
574,00:35:57.17,00:35:57.17,"I don't, I don't want to be here anymore."""
575,00:36:13.33,00:36:13.33,">> PROBST: For those of you who don't have torches, there's one"
576,00:36:15.33,00:36:15.33,behind you. Go ahead and grab it and
577,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,"approach the flame, dip it in and get fire."
578,00:36:23.17,00:36:23.17,"This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council, because in this"
579,00:36:26.12,00:36:26.12,"game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire,"
580,00:36:29.71,00:36:29.71,"you're in the game. When the fire is gone, so are"
581,00:36:32.29,00:36:32.29,you. We'll now bring in Bruce from
582,00:36:35.92,00:36:35.92,"Exile Island. During Tribal Council, Bruce is"
583,00:36:43.58,00:36:43.58,"just listening in, trying to get a gauge of the tribe"
584,00:36:46.67,00:36:46.67,"dynamics. Once the vote's over, he will"
585,00:36:49.29,00:36:49.29,"join this tribe, go back to camp with you guys."
586,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,"Shane, you made no bones about it at the challenge today."
587,00:36:56.96,00:36:56.96,"You said, ""Jeff, I'm not going to pretend for the other tribe"
588,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,"that everything's fine. It's miserable."""
589,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,">> Yeah, it's the worst thing that has ever happened to me in"
590,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,my entire life. Like I wanted to quit.
591,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,I wanted them all to write my name down and I wanted to leave
592,00:37:07.75,00:37:07.75,"here because I couldn't get out of the mania of dehydration,"
593,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,"not being able to eat, and on top of that, I smoke three"
594,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,"packs of cigarettes a day, and quit the day I got here, so"
595,00:37:19.29,00:37:19.29,"I'm in the midst of this insane withdrawal from that, and I was"
596,00:37:22.96,00:37:22.96,done. I wanted out of here.
597,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,>> PROBST: So is this like a detox for you?
598,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,">> It's like, it's some kind of psychotic, bad-idea detox."
599,00:37:32.54,00:37:32.54,"(laughter) >> PROBST: Cirie, let's talk"
600,00:37:35.46,00:37:35.46,about what's going on at camp life.
601,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,">> I think for the most part, everybody was okay with"
602,00:37:40.29,00:37:40.29,"everyone else, up until today. >> PROBST: What happened today?"
603,00:37:44.04,00:37:44.04,">> Well, no matter how happy you try to be, it's hard to"
604,00:37:47.88,00:37:47.88,"stay like that when you're told, ""It's us four,"" and"
605,00:37:51.96,00:37:51.96,that's basically what it was. And either one of y'all are
606,00:37:56.04,00:37:56.04,going to go home today. It's hurtful.
607,00:37:58.04,00:37:58.04,"I mean, I'm human. >> Especially when I think in"
608,00:38:01.42,00:38:01.42,the challenges that we have competed together in the team.
609,00:38:03.46,00:38:03.46,I don't think that there's anything that Cirie or I did or
610,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,didn't do that they have point... that they could point
611,00:38:08.75,00:38:08.75,"out to and say, ""You should have done that better."""
612,00:38:11.50,00:38:11.50,">> PROBST: So if it's you tonight, just the way it goes?"
613,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,">> No. I mean, I'm disappointed."
614,00:38:17.92,00:38:17.92,I'm pissed. I'm... hurt.
615,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,It bothers me when somebody even remotely had the thought
616,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,"to quit, and you have me here who is trying my best to stay."
617,00:38:29.96,00:38:29.96,">> PROBST: Cirie, if it's you tonight, six days is not bad."
618,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,">> Six days isn't bad, but the disappointment that my family"
619,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,would have is bad. >> PROBST: Why would they be
620,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,disappointed in you? You're giving it your all.
621,00:38:53.58,00:38:53.58,">> My family might not be disappointed, but I will be"
622,00:38:57.08,00:38:57.08,"disappointed for them, because part of the reason I"
623,00:38:59.79,00:38:59.79,"come... came here was to help them, so..."
624,00:39:04.71,00:39:04.71,"They probably wouldn't be, um, disappointed... but I would."
625,00:39:16.17,00:39:16.17,">> PROBST: To me, this tribe seems a little all over the map."
626,00:39:18.54,00:39:18.54,I'm curious to see how it plays out.
627,00:39:20.50,00:39:20.50,"It is time to vote. Cirie, you're up."
628,00:39:35.25,00:39:35.25,">> (whispering): Shane, you made me promise that I would vote for"
629,00:39:38.12,00:39:38.12,"you, and I don't go back on a promise."
630,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
631,00:40:04.88,00:40:04.88,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
632,00:40:07.21,00:40:07.21,The person voted out will be asked to leave Tribal Council
633,00:40:09.21,00:40:09.21,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
634,00:40:11.71,00:40:11.71,First vote... Shane.
635,00:40:18.38,00:40:18.38,Shane. Two votes Shane.
636,00:40:24.25,00:40:24.25,Melinda. One vote Melinda.
637,00:40:29.04,00:40:29.04,"Melinda. That's two votes Shane, two"
638,00:40:31.50,00:40:31.50,"votes Melinda. Three votes Melinda, two votes"
639,00:40:37.58,00:40:37.58,Shane. Second person voted out of
640,00:40:43.75,00:40:43.75,"Survivor Exile Island: Melinda. That's four, that's enough."
641,00:40:46.67,00:40:46.67,"You need to bring me your torch. Melinda, the tribe has spoken."
642,00:41:01.17,00:41:01.17,It's time for you to go. >> Take care.
643,00:41:13.58,00:41:13.58,">> PROBST: Bruce, drop your buff."
644,00:41:16.08,00:41:16.08,"Join your new tribe, Casaya. >> How are you doing?"
645,00:41:22.04,00:41:22.04,"Yeah, brother. Hey, brother."
646,00:41:27.04,00:41:27.04,>> PROBST: Here's your buff. Grab your torches.
647,00:41:31.08,00:41:31.08,Head back to camp. Good night.

660,00:42:15.92,00:42:15.92,"tribe that's like, ""Hey, man, yo, dude, what's up?"""
661,00:42:20.50,00:42:20.50,"And that's just not me. It won't ever be me, nor do I"
662,00:42:23.67,00:42:23.67,"think I want it to be me, so I just wish Cirie luck because I"
663,00:42:27.79,00:42:27.79,know she didn't want to go back there without me.
664,00:42:29.79,00:42:29.79,"It's just going to be hell. But I'm going to have a shower,"
665,00:42:31.79,00:42:31.79,"and I'm going to drink water, and I'm going to eat food!"
