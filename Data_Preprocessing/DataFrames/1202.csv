326,00:19:54.33,00:19:54.33,Terry just laid it out there.He said him and Dan are together
327,00:19:56.96,00:19:56.96,and they want Austin and I withthem.
328,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,"I think that him and Dan areboth strong players, both in the"

334,00:20:10.38,00:20:10.38,term in the tribe.The four of us really have
335,00:20:12.29,00:20:12.29,nothing to worry about with themajority over the three women.
336,00:20:14.50,00:20:14.50,"But, I don't know, you neverknow what's going to happen."
337,00:20:17.46,00:20:17.46,>> So let's talk strategy for aminute.
338,00:20:20.21,00:20:20.21,"I talked to Misty a little bit,and we were thinking if the"
339,00:20:24.83,00:20:24.83,"four of us stuck together,meaning you and Nick, we would"
340,00:20:29.75,00:20:29.75,"have the numbers, and then itfeels kind of even because it's"
341,00:20:32.42,00:20:32.42,"you know, two girls, two guys,and we can figure it out from"
342,00:20:34.79,00:20:34.79,"there, you know?We would definitely want to vote"
343,00:20:38.88,00:20:38.88,with you guys if you wanted to.>> Okay.
344,00:20:41.04,00:20:41.04,">> So talk to Nick when you can.>> All right, I will."
345,00:20:43.71,00:20:43.71,Cool.It is definitely Austin and
346,00:20:46.33,00:20:46.33,Nick in the middle right now.We are right in the middle of a
347,00:20:48.88,00:20:48.88,tug-of-war.It lets me know that this game
348,00:20:50.88,00:20:50.88,is serious.This isn't just all fun and
349,00:20:52.79,00:20:52.79,games.Somebody is going to have to
350,00:20:54.21,00:20:54.21,"get hurt out here.>> ""Clue one, day one."
351,00:21:09.71,00:21:09.71,You also have a lot of timeto think about why fate chose

353,00:21:16.88,00:21:16.88,"""Clue two, it is above the tideline."""
354,00:21:20.54,00:21:20.54,I read the clue.The clue just showed me a

356,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,Also it said it's above thetide mark.
357,00:21:31.00,00:21:31.00,So I figured right against thecliff someplace.
358,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50,"I'm going to be ripping thisisland apart, and I'm going to"
359,00:21:36.92,00:21:36.92,find that immunity idol.That's where I'm going to put
360,00:21:39.21,00:21:39.21,"most of my energy, after I getthe fire set up."
361,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,"And it's a little bit miserable.Inconvenience, that's all it is."
362,00:21:50.17,00:21:50.17,(murmuring)It's all worn out.
363,00:22:06.42,00:22:06.42,(yells)>> My practice will

365,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,for battle.And then I get my mind ready
366,00:22:15.38,00:22:15.38,the same way to be on thisisland.
367,00:22:25.75,00:22:25.75,">> This place is, like,horrible, evil..."
368,00:22:29.71,00:22:29.71,It's like not good to be here.I would not wish this on my

554,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,going on.If this total instability
555,00:34:46.46,00:34:46.46,"continues, it's going to bevery hard to know that he will"
556,00:34:49.92,00:34:49.92,be there for us.>> We're screwed.

559,00:35:05.96,00:35:05.96,I'm going to stop... (mumbles.)>> I don't know who's going to
560,00:35:10.62,00:35:10.62,go first.Cirie seems to think she'll go
561,00:35:12.79,00:35:12.79,"first, but I-I'm not so surethat it won't be me."
562,00:35:15.96,00:35:15.96,>> I... I feel so awful.I don't like this.
563,00:35:20.38,00:35:20.38,">> (crying): Yeah, there's a lotabout it that's not fair."
564,00:35:24.17,00:35:24.17,There really is.I was the last one picked of
565,00:35:28.21,00:35:28.21,"our group, so that's one reasonthat I think it might be me."
566,00:35:32.21,00:35:32.21,"And I'm not all, ""Ooh,meditative, cool, yeah."""
567,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,"That's just not me.>> I mean, it's one or the"
568,00:35:44.00,00:35:44.00,other at this point.Cirie and Melinda are going to
569,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,"go one-two, whatever, you know.They're the first two to go."
570,00:35:49.04,00:35:49.04,The thing I don't feel safeabout is my brain giving up.
571,00:35:53.12,00:35:53.12,"Like, I have this part of methat wants to go into Tribal"
572,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,"Council tonight and just say,""Listen, cut me out, because"

588,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,">> Yeah, it's the worst thingthat has ever happened to me in"
589,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,my entire life.Like I wanted to quit.
590,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,I wanted them all to write myname down and I wanted to leave
591,00:37:07.75,00:37:07.75,"here because I couldn't get outof the mania of dehydration,"
592,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,"not being able to eat, and ontop of that, I smoke three"
593,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,"packs of cigarettes a day, andquit the day I got here, so"
594,00:37:19.29,00:37:19.29,"I'm in the midst of this insanewithdrawal from that, and I was"
595,00:37:22.96,00:37:22.96,done.I wanted out of here.

597,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,">> It's like, it's some kind ofpsychotic, bad-idea detox."
598,00:37:32.54,00:37:32.54,"(laughter)>> PROBST: Cirie, let's talk"
599,00:37:35.46,00:37:35.46,about what's going on at camplife.
600,00:37:37.33,00:37:37.33,">> I think for the most part,everybody was okay with"
601,00:37:40.29,00:37:40.29,"everyone else, up until today.>> PROBST: What happened today?"
602,00:37:44.04,00:37:44.04,">> Well, no matter how happyyou try to be, it's hard to"
603,00:37:47.88,00:37:47.88,"stay like that when you'retold, ""It's us four,"" and"
604,00:37:51.96,00:37:51.96,that's basically what it was.And either one of y'all are
605,00:37:56.04,00:37:56.04,going to go home today.It's hurtful.
606,00:37:58.04,00:37:58.04,"I mean, I'm human.>> Especially when I think in"
607,00:38:01.42,00:38:01.42,the challenges that we havecompeted together in the team.
608,00:38:03.46,00:38:03.46,I don't think that there'sanything that Cirie or I did or
609,00:38:06.46,00:38:06.46,didn't do that they havepoint... that they could point
610,00:38:08.75,00:38:08.75,"out to and say, ""You shouldhave done that better."""
611,00:38:11.50,00:38:11.50,">> PROBST: So if it's youtonight, just the way it goes?"

614,00:38:21.12,00:38:21.12,It bothers me when somebodyeven remotely had the thought
615,00:38:24.50,00:38:24.50,"to quit, and you have me herewho is trying my best to stay."
616,00:38:29.96,00:38:29.96,">> PROBST: Cirie, if it's youtonight, six days is not bad."
617,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,">> Six days isn't bad, but thedisappointment that my family"
618,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,would have is bad.>> PROBST: Why would they be
619,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,disappointed in you?You're giving it your all.
620,00:38:53.58,00:38:53.58,">> My family might not bedisappointed, but I will be"
621,00:38:57.08,00:38:57.08,"disappointed for them,because part of the reason I"

623,00:39:04.71,00:39:04.71,"They probably wouldn't be, um,disappointed... but I would."
