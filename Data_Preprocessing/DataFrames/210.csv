4,00:00:10.03,00:00:10.03,disdain for Jerri. >> ELISABETH: I think there's a
5,00:00:13.17,00:00:13.17,crack in the tribe right now. Jerri-- I think she's going to
6,00:00:16.07,00:00:16.07,get votes from their tribe. >> JEFF: Jerri won the reward
7,00:00:21.43,00:00:21.43,"challenge and chose Amber to share in her victory, while back"
8,00:00:24.77,00:00:24.77,"at camp, Barramundi had their own celebration without them."
9,00:00:29.03,00:00:29.03,>> KEITH: What's missing? What's making it feel that way?
10,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27,The Wicked Witch of the West isn't here.

14,00:00:44.30,00:00:44.30,rainstorm... Alicia.
15,00:00:45.60,00:00:45.60,...where the former Kucha members learned that Ogakor's
16,00:00:48.03,00:00:48.03,alliance was still strong. The tribe has spoken.
17,00:00:50.93,00:00:50.93,"Alicia was voted out, becoming the first member of the jury."
18,00:00:54.27,00:00:54.27,Eight are left. Who will be the next to go?
19,00:02:11.73,00:02:11.73,>> COLBY: Last night it was just tossing and turning all night.
20,00:02:15.60,00:02:15.60,The floor of the tent was uncomfortable.
21,00:02:17.83,00:02:17.83,"When the rain started coming in, I was on the end, started"
22,00:02:21.43,00:02:21.43,"getting some water flow in my side of the tent, just draining"
23,00:02:24.83,00:02:24.83,off the tarp that we lay on. And then wake up to see the rain
24,00:02:29.47,00:02:29.47,"like this, our fire's out. It's going to be a long day."
25,00:02:40.83,00:02:40.83,">> JERRI: Right now my main concern is staying dry, 'cause I"
26,00:02:45.30,00:02:45.30,don't want to get cold. So I'm just feeling kind of
27,00:02:50.00,00:02:50.00,drained and lazy right now. So... I'm sleeping in.
28,00:02:54.07,00:02:54.07,>> ELISABETH: It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
29,00:02:59.07,00:02:59.07,">> RODGER: Yeah, maybe it'll clear off."
30,00:03:00.93,00:03:00.93,Maybe it'll only rain half the day.
31,00:03:02.67,00:03:02.67,>> AMBER: I hope our sunny days aren't completely gone though.
32,00:03:05.20,00:03:05.20,>> ELISABETH: The rainy season is upon us.
33,00:03:13.13,00:03:13.13,>> KEITH: They don't call me fireman for nothing.
34,00:03:18.70,00:03:18.70,>> NICK: Look at that. Look at that.
35,00:03:22.53,00:03:22.53,>> KEITH: The physical work is not light.
36,00:03:24.00,00:03:24.00,"You've got to go get wood, you've got to break it down,"
37,00:03:25.80,00:03:25.80,you've got to keep the fire going.
38,00:03:29.23,00:03:29.23,"And life in the outback is tough, and it's getting tougher."
39,00:03:31.67,00:03:31.67,It really is getting tougher for everybody.
40,00:03:35.43,00:03:35.43,( Nick gargling ) >> ELISABETH: What are you
41,00:03:39.43,00:03:39.43,"doing, Nick? >> NICK: I swear, every time I"
42,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57,swallow my throat just burns. The roof of my mouth feels like
43,00:03:44.93,00:03:44.93,it's been burned for the last three days.
44,00:03:47.47,00:03:47.47,>> ELISABETH: You have large taste buds?
45,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,>> NICK: Enlarged. >> ELISABETH: Wow.
46,00:03:51.63,00:03:51.63,">> NICK: I had in, like, three or four enlarged taste buds on"
47,00:03:54.63,00:03:54.63,"my tongue, which just is terrible."
48,00:03:58.17,00:03:58.17,"And I'm feeling better, but my mouth is still raw, so I can't"
49,00:04:00.97,00:04:00.97,"even drink water normally, and it's just, like, ugh."
50,00:04:05.43,00:04:05.43,>> TINA: Sure doesn't look like the spring water from home.
51,00:04:08.13,00:04:08.13,">> RODGER: No, that looks dirty. >> NICK: That's 'cause the"
52,00:04:10.53,00:04:10.53,"river's so muddy. If it's been boiled, then I'll"
53,00:04:13.83,00:04:13.83,drink it. We're out of water.
54,00:04:15.37,00:04:15.37,>> RODGER: We better... we need to definitely boil up some
55,00:04:17.43,00:04:17.43,water. >> NICK: Just dump it and get
56,00:04:19.00,00:04:19.00,some more. >> RODGER: Yeah.
57,00:04:20.73,00:04:20.73,">> TINA: The rain settled in here and it muddied our water,"
58,00:04:24.40,00:04:24.40,"and it's so cloudy, that fishing has not been good at all."
59,00:04:28.00,00:04:28.00,We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish
60,00:04:31.47,00:04:31.47,from shore and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.
61,00:04:34.30,00:04:34.30,">> RODGER: Tina, would you come down here?"
62,00:04:36.53,00:04:36.53,I'm going to have to get out of the water.
63,00:04:37.80,00:04:37.80,I've got a line hung up. >> TINA: You got a line stuck?
64,00:04:40.70,00:04:40.70,">> RODGER: Yeah, about two feet offshore here."
65,00:04:43.33,00:04:43.33,The water's just so much muddier.
66,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,"Of course I'm taking a chance on losing my hook in here, I do"
67,00:04:47.30,00:04:47.30,know that. Let me poke this way...
68,00:04:52.77,00:04:52.77,"Maybe tomorrow, we got a full day, maybe the water will clear"
69,00:04:55.37,00:04:55.37,up a little bit... >> TINA: Yeah.
70,00:04:57.03,00:04:57.03,>> RODGER: ...and try to get some fishing.
71,00:04:58.87,00:04:58.87,Something besides rice. >> COLBY: Because we're not
72,00:05:02.20,00:05:02.20,"having the fish, we're having to rely on our rice."
73,00:05:04.23,00:05:04.23,We're eating a lot more rice than maybe we should be.
74,00:05:09.03,00:05:09.03,We're down to about two or three days supply at the rate we're
75,00:05:11.40,00:05:11.40,going. We still have eight people to
76,00:05:12.90,00:05:12.90,"feed. Keith, you want me to start the"
77,00:05:14.80,00:05:14.80,"rice in ten minutes? >> KEITH: Yeah, if Jerri's up"
78,00:05:16.80,00:05:16.80,for that. >> AMBER: Or we could do the two
79,00:05:18.93,00:05:18.93,"cups of rice, it doesn't matter. >> ELISABETH: Maybe go back to"
80,00:05:21.23,00:05:21.23,the two cups. >> JERRI: One more meal of rice
81,00:05:26.03,00:05:26.03,is all we have left. >> AMBER: At the most.
82,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,">> COLBY: Ooh. >> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh, I"
83,00:05:34.70,00:05:34.70,knew it was going to be something fun.
84,00:05:37.07,00:05:37.07,">> COLBY: A rope ladder. >> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh."
85,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,">> COLBY: Oh, my gosh. Hey, guys, you guys are going"
86,00:05:43.30,00:05:43.30,to dig this one. >> ELISABETH: It's gonna be a
87,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,good one. >> COLBY: They have upped the
88,00:05:47.03,00:05:47.03,ante. It came on a rope ladder.
89,00:05:49.20,00:05:49.20,"It says ""Mental or physical, you never can tell."
90,00:05:51.77,00:05:51.77,"But you'll need a partner so, you must pair up well."
91,00:05:54.70,00:05:54.70,"One guy, one girl, one reward to split."
92,00:05:57.47,00:05:57.47,"If there's one reward to win, then this one is it."""
93,00:06:00.23,00:06:00.23,( exclaiming happily ) >> Wow!
94,00:06:03.23,00:06:03.23,">> COLBY: So we're splitting the reward, and this one is going to"
95,00:06:05.57,00:06:05.57,be big and chunky. >> TINA: A good one.
96,00:06:07.27,00:06:07.27,>> ELISABETH: How do you guys think we should decide partners?
97,00:06:09.40,00:06:09.40,>> AMBER: I don't know. Should we pull them out of the
98,00:06:10.77,00:06:10.77,hat? >> COLBY: You want to do that?
99,00:06:13.37,00:06:13.37,>> JERRI: I don't think so. >> ELISABETH: You don't want to
100,00:06:15.87,00:06:15.87,pull out of a hat? >> JERRI: No.
101,00:06:17.63,00:06:17.63,I think we should pick. >> ELISABETH: Who would you
102,00:06:20.77,00:06:20.77,pick? >> JERRI: I'd pick Colby.
103,00:06:22.27,00:06:22.27,">> TINA: Well, duh, who wouldn't?"
104,00:06:23.80,00:06:23.80,">> JERRI: Well, the whole thing is, you know, when did this game"
105,00:06:26.47,00:06:26.47,"start being fair? >> TINA: No, but I think it is"
106,00:06:29.67,00:06:29.67,"about team-manship. >> RODGER: I'm the old guy here,"
107,00:06:32.53,00:06:32.53,"I know nobody wants to be with me, but you know..."
108,00:06:34.37,00:06:34.37,">> AMBER: Oh, Rodger! >> RODGER: Sometimes you've just"
109,00:06:36.40,00:06:36.40,"got to go with the flow. >> TINA: How we going to do it,"
110,00:06:38.83,00:06:38.83,Colby? >> COLBY: I've got all the guys'
111,00:06:41.03,00:06:41.03,names written on a piece of paper.
112,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,>> AMBER: And the girls pick? >> COLBY: Yep.
113,00:06:45.80,00:06:45.80,">> AMBER: Don't open it yet, till we all get one."
114,00:06:47.53,00:06:47.53,">> TINA: Did I get one? >> COLBY: Yep, you got it."
115,00:06:49.77,00:06:49.77,"Don't look at them yet. All right, you can look at them."
116,00:06:52.60,00:06:52.60,">> AMBER: Keith, you're my partner!"
117,00:06:54.07,00:06:54.07,">> ELISABETH: Nick, you're my partner."
118,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23,">> JERRI: Colby. >> TINA: Oh, my goodness."
119,00:06:59.03,00:06:59.03,>> ELISABETH: That's funny. ( scattered chuckling )
120,00:07:02.57,00:07:02.57,>> COLBY: Ready to rock? >> JERRI: Yeah.
121,00:07:05.70,00:07:05.70,"Ironically enough, I ended up being Colby's partner, anyway."
122,00:07:08.10,00:07:08.10,I think it's important that people are constantly reminded
123,00:07:10.93,00:07:10.93,of the reality of our situation. There's nothing fair about this.
124,00:07:16.33,00:07:16.33,"And... you know, it's about winning."
125,00:07:20.13,00:07:20.13,">> COLBY: Jerri said, ""Well, I don't want to draw names."""
126,00:07:24.10,00:07:24.10,"Tina said, ""Why not?"" She said, ""I think we ought to"
127,00:07:26.77,00:07:26.77,"pick."" She said ""Who would you pick?"""
128,00:07:28.20,00:07:28.20,"She said ""Colby."" I'm sitting there going, well,"
129,00:07:31.33,00:07:31.33,"now hold on, let's think about who Colby would pick here."
130,00:07:33.67,00:07:33.67,"Granted, I want to win this thing, but I don't know that I"
131,00:07:36.20,00:07:36.20,want to share with her whatever it is.
132,00:07:45.83,00:07:45.83,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys. Today's reward challenge"
133,00:07:49.07,00:07:49.07,is the biggest one yet. A helicopter is going to land at
134,00:07:52.77,00:07:52.77,Barramundi Beach and take you to one of the Seven Wonders of the
135,00:07:55.57,00:07:55.57,"World-- the Great Barrier Reef. >> ELISABETH: Oh, my gosh."
136,00:07:59.77,00:07:59.77,>> JEFF: Where you'll go snorkeling in the clear blue
137,00:08:02.43,00:08:02.43,"water, and you'll be treated to a great lunch."
138,00:08:04.80,00:08:04.80,The challenge is an obstacle course.
139,00:08:07.13,00:08:07.13,You and your partner must stay together.
140,00:08:08.73,00:08:08.73,There will be three heats with two teams competing.
141,00:08:11.27,00:08:11.27,"It's simple elimination. If you win, you advance."
142,00:08:13.70,00:08:13.70,"If you lose, you're out. The winners from the first two"
143,00:08:17.13,00:08:17.13,heats will move on to the final. The winning team is going to the
144,00:08:20.07,00:08:20.07,Reef. You've already drawn straws to
145,00:08:22.03,00:08:22.03,see who's going to race first. You've picked your partners.
146,00:08:24.27,00:08:24.27,Let's go. This is heat number one.

276,00:19:26.07,00:19:26.07,and see one of the wonders of the world would have been great.

279,00:19:35.77,00:19:35.77,"really clear blue water and have a big meal, it would've been"

289,00:20:48.00,00:20:48.00,of that environment. This is basically the perfect
290,00:20:53.60,00:20:53.60,honeymoon without the sex. >> COLBY: Jerri was quite giddy
291,00:21:06.70,00:21:06.70,on our little getaway. >> JERRI: Mmm!
292,00:21:09.93,00:21:09.93,>> COLBY: She made a comment to me about it being a honeymoon
293,00:21:12.13,00:21:12.13,"without the sex, and it couldn't be farther from the truth for"
294,00:21:13.43,00:21:13.43,"me. I mean, we certainly didn't sit"

297,00:21:20.03,00:21:20.03,for. I was just looking for some down
298,00:21:22.27,00:21:22.27,time away from the game and that's what I got.

302,00:21:35.47,00:21:35.47,so we're just going to go back in and try to be as humble as
303,00:21:37.70,00:21:37.70,"possible about it. If somebody pisses me off, then"

363,00:25:02.53,00:25:02.53,So that determines why Nick goes before them.

369,00:25:22.43,00:25:22.43,"says, ""Listen, I'm rea... You know, I'm ready to go."""
370,00:25:24.57,00:25:24.57,"So, I don't feel real bad about that."
371,00:25:27.97,00:25:27.97,>> ELISABETH: I don't think we've been alone together in a
372,00:25:29.70,00:25:29.70,"long time, the three of us. >> NICK: That's true."
373,00:25:31.57,00:25:31.57,>> RODGER: You're right. >> ELISABETH: The remaining

376,00:25:38.80,00:25:38.80,"Well, basically, Kucha's outnumbered right now by Ogakor,"
377,00:25:41.90,00:25:41.90,"and there's a chance, one by one, we could go."
378,00:25:44.40,00:25:44.40,I know Nick feels as if he's probably the next to go out of
379,00:25:47.23,00:25:47.23,"our tribe, but if he wins immunity, it could just as"

381,00:25:52.57,00:25:52.57,"immunity challenge, I think I'm a goner."
382,00:25:55.83,00:25:55.83,"I'll go boil water. >> RODGER: Well, maybe that's"
383,00:25:56.87,00:25:56.87,why. They...

389,00:26:09.17,00:26:09.17,challenge is important to stay alive.

410,00:27:13.83,00:27:13.83,"your strength. In fact, one of the keys is"
411,00:27:16.23,00:27:16.23,figuring out how to use your opponent's strength against them
412,00:27:19.33,00:27:19.33,to knock them off balance. There will be three rounds.
413,00:27:22.10,00:27:22.10,Each round's a different challenge.
414,00:27:23.90,00:27:23.90,"It's single elimination. Lose, you're out."
415,00:27:25.90,00:27:25.90,"Win, you move on. First round, you'll climb up"
416,00:27:28.50,00:27:28.50,"onto the towers, one against another, and using a rope,"
417,00:27:31.33,00:27:31.33,you're going to try and knock your opponent off balance into
418,00:27:34.17,00:27:34.17,the water. It's not a tug of war.
419,00:27:36.37,00:27:36.37,"You can pull on the rope, or if you want, just let it go."
420,00:27:39.60,00:27:39.60,"Next round, you have a shaky beam."
421,00:27:41.67,00:27:41.67,"So, it's all about using your legs and redistributing weight"
422,00:27:44.90,00:27:44.90,to get them forward or backwards.

500,00:33:00.57,00:33:00.57,"So, I think it's totally... >> JERRI: The main thing that's"
501,00:33:04.37,00:33:04.37,changing now that Nick has won today's immunity is that we were
502,00:33:09.07,00:33:09.07,all going to vote him off tonight.
503,00:33:11.80,00:33:11.80,"So, it was discussed on the walk back to camp who we would be"
504,00:33:16.47,00:33:16.47,voting for instead. It was decided by the ex-Ogakor
505,00:33:21.97,00:33:21.97,"tribe that, um, Elisabeth would be the next one to go."
506,00:33:26.87,00:33:26.87,>> ELISABETH: It made me scared a little.

508,00:33:34.73,00:33:34.73,Could be me or you. >> ELISABETH: It could be.
509,00:33:37.20,00:33:37.20,>> AMBER: The tribal council's definitely never a place where I
510,00:33:39.37,00:33:39.37,want to go. I hate going every single time.
511,00:33:41.30,00:33:41.30,It's voting somebody off. It doesn't matter if you've been
512,00:33:43.67,00:33:43.67,with that person the whole entire time or only a couple
513,00:33:45.50,00:33:45.50,days. It's still really hard to do.
514,00:33:52.90,00:33:52.90,"I definitely want to talk to, you know, Jerri and Colby and"
515,00:33:55.60,00:33:55.60,Tina and Keith tonight to see if our original plan's still in
516,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,effect. The plan was kind of just get
517,00:34:01.07,00:34:01.07,rid of Kucha one by one by one. >> ELISABETH: You guys are
518,00:34:04.20,00:34:04.20,pretty much in control-- you know that-- 'cause of your
519,00:34:06.43,00:34:06.43,"numbers. And, I mean, I..."
520,00:34:10.07,00:34:10.07,"My next vote would be for Jerri, anyway."
521,00:34:12.93,00:34:12.93,"I think that she just brings people down, and I don't like"
522,00:34:15.37,00:34:15.37,how she is to even people on her own tribe.
523,00:34:17.43,00:34:17.43,Her allegiance is only to herself.
524,00:34:18.63,00:34:18.63,>> TINA: Mm-hmm. But we have to vote you or
525,00:34:19.90,00:34:19.90,Rodger off. >> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm.
526,00:34:21.40,00:34:21.40,">> TINA: Because, you know, that's the safe thing to do."
527,00:34:23.10,00:34:23.10,>> ELISABETH: Right. >> TINA: It's hard.
528,00:34:24.57,00:34:24.57,It's hard to talk about. >> ELISABETH: Mm-hmm.
529,00:34:26.27,00:34:26.27,">> TINA: You know, because you and Rodger just have more of"
530,00:34:28.27,00:34:28.27,that heart and soul that we want.
531,00:34:31.63,00:34:31.63,Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the
532,00:34:35.07,00:34:35.07,order. We all agree or disagree on
533,00:34:37.60,00:34:37.60,things. >> COLBY: But there is one other
534,00:34:40.80,00:34:40.80,alternative. That we can eliminate Jerri.
535,00:34:43.37,00:34:43.37,>> KEITH: I mean... we are... We're stuck with her...
536,00:34:45.83,00:34:45.83,Well... I don't know.
537,00:34:47.33,00:34:47.33,">> COLBY: Keith, I'm sorry, but we're talking about a lot of"
538,00:34:50.33,00:34:50.33,"money at stake. >> KEITH: No, I understand that."
539,00:34:52.43,00:34:52.43,"I understand that, man. >> COLBY: Okay."
540,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,>> KEITH: We have an opportunity that is staring us right in the
541,00:34:56.73,00:34:56.73,"face, and it's guaranteed. Want to get rid of Jerri"
542,00:34:58.83,00:34:58.83,"collectively? >> COLBY: Keith, listen to what"
543,00:35:01.20,00:35:01.20,you just said. Why would we allow that
544,00:35:03.30,00:35:03.30,possibility to even come to fruition when we've got an
545,00:35:06.07,00:35:06.07,opportunity right now to keep things going exactly the way
546,00:35:09.03,00:35:09.03,"they are, and then get rid of Jerri as soon as we can?"
547,00:35:13.30,00:35:13.30,"And, boy, do I want to. Man, I had to put up with her"
548,00:35:16.53,00:35:16.53,"all day yesterday. >> KEITH: You know, it's, uh..."
549,00:35:19.20,00:35:19.20,>> COLBY: I can't imagine getting rid of Elisabeth over
550,00:35:20.73,00:35:20.73,"her, but... >> KEITH: I know, and, uh..."
551,00:35:22.27,00:35:22.27,>> COLBY: It's just... It's-It's...
552,00:35:23.73,00:35:23.73,>> KEITH: My gut tells me... >> COLBY: It's the right move.
553,00:35:25.67,00:35:25.67,">> KEITH: I understand. I mean, it makes sense."
554,00:35:36.03,00:35:36.03,>> COLBY: Blue. >> JERRI: Hey.
555,00:35:37.87,00:35:37.87,">> RODGER: Hey, now. Here you go."
556,00:35:44.73,00:35:44.73,>> JERRI: We're off like a herd of turtles.
557,00:35:46.23,00:35:46.23,"( indistinct conversation ) >> JEFF: Now, I'll bring in the"
558,00:36:17.97,00:36:17.97,first member of our jury. The jury is not to be addressed.
559,00:36:25.80,00:36:25.80,"No comments, reference to the jury."
560,00:36:28.03,00:36:28.03,The jury will not speak to you. The jury is merely here to
561,00:36:31.70,00:36:31.70,gather information that they will use in deciding which one
562,00:36:35.13,00:36:35.13,of the final two gets the million dollars.
563,00:36:38.40,00:36:38.40,"Each tribal council, as you guys are voted off, you will become a"
564,00:36:41.23,00:36:41.23,"part of the jury, and the power will shift to that side."
565,00:36:44.80,00:36:44.80,"Nick, on a scale of one to ten, how important was immunity for"
566,00:36:48.13,00:36:48.13,"you today? >> NICK: Oh, this is a ten."
567,00:36:51.20,00:36:51.20,"If, um... if I hadn't won immunity today, I fully expected"
568,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,to get voted off. >> JEFF: Based on?
569,00:36:56.20,00:36:56.20,">> NICK: Based on the way voting has been going, uh, based on"
570,00:36:59.67,00:36:59.67,"my place in the tribe. Uh, I-I fully expected if I lost"
571,00:37:04.20,00:37:04.20,"today to, uh, be sitting on... in the jury the next... next"
572,00:37:07.50,00:37:07.50,"time around, so... >> JEFF: Jerri, as you look at"
573,00:37:11.17,00:37:11.17,"the jury, you got one member over there."
574,00:37:13.20,00:37:13.20,"You guys, right now, have a one- in-eight shot at a million"
575,00:37:14.80,00:37:14.80,bucks. Have you surprised yourself with
576,00:37:17.53,00:37:17.53,"the way you've acted out here? >> JERRI: Honestly, I had no"
577,00:37:20.83,00:37:20.83,idea that this was going to be as tough as it is.
578,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,And I have woken up in the morning and gone through an
579,00:37:27.63,00:37:27.63,entire day wondering who I am. Things come out of my mouth in
580,00:37:31.80,00:37:31.80,"frustration and out of hunger and just stress that, after they"
581,00:37:36.17,00:37:36.17,"come out, I want to suck them back in and... 'cause I..."
582,00:37:41.93,00:37:41.93,It's not something that I would normally say or... or act.
583,00:37:45.37,00:37:45.37,"So, yeah, I've surprised myself in a lot of ways."
584,00:37:49.63,00:37:49.63,">> JEFF: Elisabeth, due to the numbers, you're having to sort"
585,00:37:53.03,00:37:53.03,of go their way. Worried at all?
586,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,"Strong competitor, you're going to be tough if you get to the"
587,00:37:58.40,00:37:58.40,final two. You're probably a target at some
588,00:38:00.93,00:38:00.93,point. >> ELISABETH: That definitely
589,00:38:03.03,00:38:03.03,"goes through my mind. You know, you come here, and"
590,00:38:05.87,00:38:05.87,"basically, anyone is a target. But when you're in a minority,"
591,00:38:10.10,00:38:10.10,"you know, of numbers, the reality sets in a little more"
592,00:38:13.60,00:38:13.60,harshly. You're always vulnerable here.
593,00:38:18.03,00:38:18.03,"Nothing is guaranteed, and you can't assume anything, because"
594,00:38:21.07,00:38:21.07,"that's the most dangerous, dangerous thing you can possibly"
595,00:38:24.63,00:38:24.63,do here in the outback in this game is assume.
596,00:38:28.63,00:38:28.63,"Assume you're safe, assume you're right."
597,00:38:30.97,00:38:30.97,"You're not. And, so I come here prepared..."
598,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,"for the worst. >> JEFF: So, let's vote."
599,00:38:38.17,00:38:38.17,"Elisabeth, you're first. >> AMBER: Elisabeth, this is"
600,00:39:14.30,00:39:14.30,"going to be the hardest vote yet, and the hardest vote for"
601,00:39:16.30,00:39:16.30,the rest of the game. But the only reason why I am
602,00:39:18.97,00:39:18.97,"making it is because I made a word with my original tribe, and"
603,00:39:22.13,00:39:22.13,"I want to stick to my word. >> RODGER: Most days, she gets"
604,00:39:45.00,00:39:45.00,"up in a good mood, but oh, baby, look out if she gets up in a bad"
605,00:39:48.20,00:39:48.20,mood. >> JERRI: I've never in my life
606,00:40:09.53,00:40:09.53,met anyone more likable and more lovable.
607,00:40:13.00,00:40:13.00,"Because you are such a likable person, it is a definite threat."
608,00:40:25.33,00:40:25.33,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
609,00:40:36.53,00:40:36.53,"Once the votes are tallied, the decision is final."
610,00:40:38.77,00:40:38.77,The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the
611,00:40:41.40,00:40:41.40,tribal council area immediately. First vote...
612,00:40:49.43,00:40:49.43,Elisabeth. Jerri.
613,00:40:59.63,00:40:59.63,Elisabeth. Jerri.
614,00:41:06.93,00:41:06.93,"Two votes Elisabeth, two votes Jerri."
615,00:41:13.00,00:41:13.00,"Three votes Jerri. Four votes Jerri, two votes"
616,00:41:19.97,00:41:19.97,Elisabeth. Five votes Jerri.
617,00:41:31.23,00:41:31.23,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
618,00:41:40.40,00:41:40.40,>> JERRI: Checkmate. You guys got me.
619,00:41:42.30,00:41:42.30,( laughs ) Good game.
620,00:41:47.57,00:41:47.57,">> JEFF: Jerri, the tribe has spoken."
621,00:41:54.13,00:41:54.13,"It's time for you to go. Based on that vote, maybe the"
622,00:42:01.50,00:42:01.50,"game has changed, and a new tribe finally has been born."
623,00:42:06.53,00:42:06.53,Barramundi is alive and kicking. You guys can head back to camp.
624,00:42:27.00,00:42:27.00,>> JEFF: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode and hear
625,00:42:29.07,00:42:29.07,what Jerri has to say. Next time on Survivor:
626,00:42:36.47,00:42:36.47,The tribe wakes up and realizes that Jerri is really gone.
627,00:42:40.90,00:42:40.90,>> COLBY: Sweet. >> ELISABETH: Her own tribe
628,00:42:42.83,00:42:42.83,voted against her. >> JEFF: But the survivors are
629,00:42:44.97,00:42:44.97,"too hungry to celebrate. >> ELISABETH: I'm just, like,"
630,00:42:47.57,00:42:47.57,shaking and weak. >> JEFF: They are offered more
631,00:42:50.23,00:42:50.23,"food, but at what price? >> JERRI: You know, it's funny"
632,00:43:00.77,00:43:00.77,because I absolutely knew this was coming.
633,00:43:04.13,00:43:04.13,It must have been my remark about how this game isn't fair.
634,00:43:09.57,00:43:09.57,I'm pretty sure that's what set everyone off.
635,00:43:12.00,00:43:12.00,I've had a great time. And I'm still up for sitting
636,00:43:15.00,00:43:15.00,around with everybody having a beer and laughing about this
637,00:43:17.13,00:43:17.13,whole thing.
