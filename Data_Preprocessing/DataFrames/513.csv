2,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST:   Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.53,00:00:03.53, Clay gave Jake  a piece of his mind.
4,00:00:05.13,00:00:05.13,I didn't like that statement
5,00:00:06.87,00:00:06.87,worth a ... up at that council meeting.
6,00:00:08.53,00:00:08.53,"I'll put my production up, basically, against anybody's."
7,00:00:11.37,00:00:11.37, And that offended Clay.
8,00:00:13.13,00:00:13.13,PROBST: The tribe was  surprised to find
9,00:00:14.70,00:00:14.70, their loved  ones at the reward challenge.
10,00:00:17.90,00:00:17.90, But even more surprised  when the family members
11,00:00:20.27,00:00:20.27, had to compete  against each other.
12,00:00:22.13,00:00:22.13,There's that juice.
13,00:00:23.27,00:00:23.27, It was Helen's husband Jim  who stomached the victory
14,00:00:27.63,00:00:27.63, and became an honorary tribe  member for a day.
15,00:00:30.20,00:00:30.20," With Jim as a confidant,"
16,00:00:32.60,00:00:32.60, Helen had a chance  to talk about strategy.
17,00:00:35.33,00:00:35.33,Brian'll play fair; Clay won't.
18,00:00:37.87,00:00:37.87,Clay's a selfish son of a gun.
19,00:00:39.27,00:00:39.27,"PROBST:  At the immunity challenge,"
20,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00, the tribe was  surprised again.
21,00:00:42.73,00:00:42.73,-No! -(shouting)
22,00:00:45.43,00:00:45.43,"PROBST: This time, castaways  and family members"
23,00:00:47.27,00:00:47.27," competed together,"
24,00:00:48.73,00:00:48.73, and brotherly teamwork  paid off for Ted.
25,00:00:51.37,00:00:51.37,-Big Ted! -(shouting)
26,00:00:53.57,00:00:53.57," Before Tribal Council,  Helen approached Brian"
27,00:00:55.77,00:00:55.77, with her concerns about Clay.
28,00:00:58.40,00:00:58.40,Do you feel that he has
29,00:00:59.83,00:00:59.83,earned a number one or two spot?
30,00:01:03.03,00:01:03.03,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,  despite a campaign"
31,00:01:05.40,00:01:05.40," to get rid of Clay,"
32,00:01:06.63,00:01:06.63, Jake was voted out  of the tribe.
33,00:01:08.73,00:01:08.73,The tribe has spoken.
34,00:01:11.27,00:01:11.27, The five former members  of Chuay Gahn
35,00:01:13.57,00:01:13.57, are all that remain.
36,00:01:15.20,00:01:15.20," Tonight, one of them will go."
37,00:03:03.40,00:03:03.40,JAN: 34 days.
38,00:03:05.10,00:03:05.10,Five to go.
39,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,HELEN: We haven't been  to Tribal Council
40,00:03:09.67,00:03:09.67, to vote off a Chuay Gahn  member since day 12.
41,00:03:13.20,00:03:13.20,"Chuay Gahn, who started out as the joke team of Survivor,"
42,00:03:17.13,00:03:17.13," as the losers,  as the old people,"
43,00:03:19.80,00:03:19.80," as the ones  that, you know what,"
44,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17," ""You band of misfits,"
45,00:03:22.53,00:03:22.53," you can't  do anything right."""
46,00:03:25.33,00:03:25.33,But we never lost focus and we never gave up.
47,00:03:27.43,00:03:27.43,TED: The core of Chuay Gahn is right here.
48,00:03:30.60,00:03:30.60,CLAY: Yep.
49,00:03:31.80,00:03:31.80,"If it wasn't for us,"
50,00:03:34.50,00:03:34.50,we would have been extinct.
51,00:03:36.00,00:03:36.00,"HELEN: And now, definitely,  the game is on."
52,00:03:39.37,00:03:39.37," Jake left,  now it's Chuay Gahn,"
53,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57, now we have to vote  each other out.
54,00:03:43.27,00:03:43.27," The game is on,"
55,00:03:44.37,00:03:44.37,full speed ahead.
56,00:03:45.73,00:03:45.73,(whistling tune)
57,00:03:48.27,00:03:48.27,BRIAN:  What skills come into play
58,00:03:50.10,00:03:50.10, at this part of the game?
59,00:03:51.70,00:03:51.70,Skating skills. Who's the best skater?
60,00:03:54.40,00:03:54.40,Ice skater.
61,00:03:55.57,00:03:55.57," Who's got  the longest skates on,"
62,00:03:57.37,00:03:57.37," who's the best at cutting  corners, going around circles?"
63,00:04:01.50,00:04:01.50,Because usually on skating you got to be ice cold.
64,00:04:03.90,00:04:03.90," You can't lose your cool,  you got to be like ice."
65,00:04:06.53,00:04:06.53," You're going to have  friendships,"
66,00:04:07.77,00:04:07.77, you got to cut off  those friendships.
67,00:04:09.43,00:04:09.43," You got to keep  stringing people along,"
68,00:04:10.80,00:04:10.80, and-- bam!--  throw them a nice slider.
69,00:04:12.60,00:04:12.60,Mr. Freeze is in the house.
70,00:04:15.10,00:04:15.10,"Even though it's about 110 out here, I've got my skates on."
71,00:04:19.67,00:04:19.67,CLAY: Got us some mail.
72,00:04:22.83,00:04:22.83,"Oh, hey, a mirror."
73,00:04:26.47,00:04:26.47,Holy crap.
74,00:04:28.30,00:04:28.30,Can you believe this?
75,00:04:31.23,00:04:31.23,Look at this.
76,00:04:32.83,00:04:32.83,I'm a nothing.
77,00:04:34.27,00:04:34.27,Hey! Treemail!
78,00:04:37.73,00:04:37.73,-Oh! -TED: Read it.
79,00:04:39.33,00:04:39.33,"Oh, y'all got to come see this. I can't read this."
80,00:04:42.17,00:04:42.17,We got a mirror.
81,00:04:43.43,00:04:43.43,Don't look at it too much. We don't want it to crack.
82,00:04:46.47,00:04:46.47,Y'all not going to believe the wrinkles in my face.
83,00:04:49.47,00:04:49.47, I could not believe
84,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,how I looked.
85,00:04:52.60,00:04:52.60,"I mean, it looks like I'm... I'm 60."
86,00:04:55.43,00:04:55.43,"I'll tell you all one damn thing,"
87,00:04:57.43,00:04:57.43,I-I got a lot more wrinkles I got now
88,00:04:59.80,00:04:59.80,"-than I had when I came. -HELEN: Oh, my God."
89,00:05:01.93,00:05:01.93,-TED: Get out of here. -BRIAN: That's just funny.
90,00:05:03.80,00:05:03.80,CLAY: We got to go get our mirror and bring it...
91,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,"-Wait, here comes Brian. -""Behold the magic mirror,"
92,00:05:07.63,00:05:07.63,"""you've never looked so great."
93,00:05:09.57,00:05:09.57,"""This is no illusion, you've really lost some weight."
94,00:05:13.03,00:05:13.03,"""Compare yourself to these photos"
95,00:05:15.03,00:05:15.03,"""taken just before the game."
96,00:05:16.70,00:05:16.70,"You may return to regular size, but you'll never be the same."""
97,00:05:20.43,00:05:20.43,Ohh...
98,00:05:21.43,00:05:21.43,"Oh, God."
99,00:05:23.03,00:05:23.03,(all shouting)
100,00:05:25.03,00:05:25.03,Chubby face.
101,00:05:26.30,00:05:26.30,Hold on a second now. Hold on a second now.
102,00:05:28.83,00:05:28.83,Oh!
103,00:05:30.47,00:05:30.47,JAN: When I first saw my own  picture I started laughing
104,00:05:33.37,00:05:33.37,'cause I was full where I had these little cheekbone...
105,00:05:37.03,00:05:37.03,"these little chubby cheeks there,"
106,00:05:38.30,00:05:38.30, and I had some bosoms.
107,00:05:40.57,00:05:40.57, That was kind of funny.
108,00:05:41.97,00:05:41.97, And now I look kind of like
109,00:05:43.27,00:05:43.27,a stick figure.
110,00:05:45.07,00:05:45.07,"-Look at Clay... -CLAY: I am hot, y'all!"
111,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,-Big teeth. -You handsome thing.

113,00:05:52.50,00:05:52.50,Wow.
114,00:05:53.53,00:05:53.53,-310 pounds. -You look chubby here!
115,00:05:55.97,00:05:55.97,"-That's the worst picture. -I like this, boy."
116,00:05:57.67,00:05:57.67,That's where you are.
117,00:05:59.33,00:05:59.33,Yeah.
118,00:06:01.87,00:06:01.87,This is a lineman.
119,00:06:03.57,00:06:03.57,-I told you your whole face changed. -This is like a...
120,00:06:05.47,00:06:05.47,"a tight end, wide receiver."
121,00:06:06.83,00:06:06.83,"Yeah, I told you your whole face..."
122,00:06:08.30,00:06:08.30,Look at how little your neck is.
123,00:06:09.90,00:06:09.90,Look how big it is there.
124,00:06:11.17,00:06:11.17,"TED: Actually seeing myself  in the mirror,"
125,00:06:12.70,00:06:12.70, I didn't know  who the heck I was.
126,00:06:14.60,00:06:14.60,"I mean, I looked at myself before,"
127,00:06:16.20,00:06:16.20," and now, oh, my gosh,"
128,00:06:19.30,00:06:19.30,it's like two totally different people.
129,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17,I look like my brother.
130,00:06:24.10,00:06:24.10,"-This guy is gone. -CLAY: What you think, Helen?"
131,00:06:25.97,00:06:25.97,HELEN: I think I still look fat.
132,00:06:27.83,00:06:27.83,"-Oh, shut up! -You-You're on drugs."
133,00:06:30.10,00:06:30.10,JAN: You lost it everywhere.
134,00:06:32.03,00:06:32.03,TED: You don't see the six pack?
135,00:06:33.10,00:06:33.10,-Six pack? -Yeah.
136,00:06:35.17,00:06:35.17,-I see little lines right here. -You-You're tripping.
137,00:06:36.93,00:06:36.93,HELEN:  You kind of look at yourself
138,00:06:38.43,00:06:38.43," and tell you're losing  some weight,"
139,00:06:39.77,00:06:39.77,but looking at yourself in a full-length mirror...
140,00:06:42.47,00:06:42.47," I-I... you know, one look was  enough for me."
141,00:06:44.40,00:06:44.40," I'm like, ""Uh, yeah,  I still look fat,"
142,00:06:46.03,00:06:46.03,"and, uh... great, I got lines on my face, okay, I'm done."""
143,00:06:48.87,00:06:48.87,Now my damn teeth are yellow.
144,00:06:50.87,00:06:50.87,-JAN: Would y'all quit playing? -The guns are gone.
145,00:06:53.10,00:06:53.10,"Excuse me, uh, pretty girls."
146,00:06:55.17,00:06:55.17,We have three guys in the mirror.
147,00:06:56.93,00:06:56.93,Would-Would y'all quit playing?

149,00:07:00.43,00:07:00.43,-Look at 'em! -I got like nine millimeters now.
150,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,BRIAN: This isn't fair.
151,00:07:03.70,00:07:03.70,JAN: The women could barely  see themselves
152,00:07:05.47,00:07:05.47, because the men took  over the mirror.
153,00:07:06.90,00:07:06.90, That was pathetic.
154,00:07:08.20,00:07:08.20, We couldn't get  the men out of the way.
155,00:07:10.20,00:07:10.20," They were admiring, lifting..."
156,00:07:12.07,00:07:12.07,"""Hey, look at these guns."""
157,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77,"I mean, they were pathetic."

161,00:07:26.87,00:07:26.87,"Who's, uh, who's next?"
162,00:07:29.17,00:07:29.17,"Uh... You know who, don't you? Janny."
163,00:07:32.03,00:07:32.03,-Jan? -Yeah.

170,00:07:44.67,00:07:44.67,Yeah. It's... (mutters)

172,00:07:48.10,00:07:48.10,"with, uh, everyone else."
173,00:07:49.43,00:07:49.43,"So it might be every man for himself,"
174,00:07:51.00,00:07:51.00,"keep on your toes sort of thing,"

183,00:08:07.77,00:08:07.77,I have a feeling Clay is going to try to get me.

204,00:08:51.40,00:08:51.40,in our... in our alliance-- that something has changed.
205,00:08:54.67,00:08:54.67,"Lookee, lookee, lookee!"
206,00:08:56.43,00:08:56.43,We haven't even opened it.
207,00:08:58.17,00:08:58.17,We haven't opened it. I just opened it.
208,00:08:59.57,00:08:59.57,-It looks like a book. -JAN: Oh!
209,00:09:01.07,00:09:01.07,"-Oh, my gosh. Quite a book. -Oh, this is cool."

217,00:09:25.13,00:09:25.13,Oh...
218,00:09:26.43,00:09:26.43,"""This reward's the one for you"
219,00:09:28.97,00:09:28.97,"if you're hungry, tired and sore."""
220,00:09:31.03,00:09:31.03,"Well, that's me. Who's always asking about food?"
221,00:09:33.60,00:09:33.60,-So y'all just... -You don't get any more food!
222,00:09:35.53,00:09:35.53,You've already had yours.
223,00:09:37.57,00:09:37.57,"You've had your food. Sorry, so you're done."
224,00:09:39.50,00:09:39.50,"TED: With me, on those  that I've trusted"
225,00:09:43.10,00:09:43.10," up until this point, I want  to continue to trust,"
226,00:09:45.57,00:09:45.57," maybe 80, 85%."
227,00:09:47.57,00:09:47.57,But I'm not going to sit back
228,00:09:50.10,00:09:50.10,and just base the results of this game on that trust.
229,00:10:03.63,00:10:03.63, One of my strategies  from day one
230,00:10:05.57,00:10:05.57, was to adapt  to any given situation.
231,00:10:10.30,00:10:10.30, So I wanted to communicate  with Helen
232,00:10:12.40,00:10:12.40, and ask her her feelings of who she thought
233,00:10:14.37,00:10:14.37,the top four would be.
234,00:10:16.80,00:10:16.80," And I started drawing in the sand, the alternative option is"
235,00:10:20.53,00:10:20.53," to eliminate Clay and bring  Helen, myself and Janny"
236,00:10:25.13,00:10:25.13," in the final four,"
237,00:10:27.53,00:10:27.53, then make a decision  on how we want to operate
238,00:10:30.67,00:10:30.67," with Brian,  you know, whether we want"
239,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17, to keep him  or whether we want to
240,00:10:34.53,00:10:34.53,"you know, vote him out."
241,00:10:35.73,00:10:35.73, And it was good for me to know
242,00:10:38.17,00:10:38.17," that she was basically on the  same thought path as I was,"
243,00:10:41.63,00:10:41.63, as far as Clay's contribution  to the tribe.
244,00:10:44.93,00:10:44.93, Clay doesn't do anything.  He lays around all day.
245,00:10:48.63,00:10:48.63," He doesn't go out, get wood."
246,00:10:51.13,00:10:51.13," He doesn't go out for the  water hole, he does nothing."
247,00:10:54.17,00:10:54.17," He just lays around all day,  so..."
248,00:10:56.30,00:10:56.30," So logically, he would be  the next, in my mind,"
249,00:10:58.43,00:10:58.43, the next person  to get voted out.
250,00:11:07.23,00:11:07.23,"Hey, guys!"
251,00:11:08.80,00:11:08.80,(shouting and laughter)
252,00:11:10.13,00:11:10.13,What do you think of the ride?
253,00:11:11.43,00:11:11.43,"Let's go. Big Ted, take the front."
254,00:11:12.90,00:11:12.90,Oh!
255,00:11:15.47,00:11:15.47,Lord have mercy.
256,00:11:16.97,00:11:16.97,"Get on in, baby. This is what you're playing for."
257,00:11:20.20,00:11:20.20,"-Oh, my God! -Ow!"
258,00:11:22.13,00:11:22.13,"HELEN: Oh, it's got that new car smell."
259,00:11:24.03,00:11:24.03,JAN: Whoa!
260,00:11:25.33,00:11:25.33,Ah!
261,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,Kind of a heavy foot there.
262,00:11:29.20,00:11:29.20,(screaming)
263,00:11:32.23,00:11:32.23,This is what I'm talking about.
264,00:11:34.33,00:11:34.33,CLAY: Whoa!
265,00:11:35.77,00:11:35.77,"JAN: Oh, my God."
266,00:11:38.93,00:11:38.93,I don't want to get out. It fits too good.
267,00:11:41.33,00:11:41.33,Hop out. We got a challenge to do.
268,00:11:47.07,00:11:47.07,First things first.
269,00:11:48.53,00:11:48.53,"Let's talk about this SUV. Not a bad-looking ride, huh?"
270,00:11:51.23,00:11:51.23,-JAN: Uh-uh. Gorgeous. -Perfect. Perfect. 
271,00:11:53.10,00:11:53.10,The winner will win the Chevy Trail Blazer.
272,00:11:55.93,00:11:55.93,The other part of the reward is
273,00:11:58.40,00:11:58.40,"a day at a spa, Survivor  style."
274,00:12:00.77,00:12:00.77,Ah...
275,00:12:01.77,00:12:01.77,-We've also arranged for a nice massage. -(gasps)
276,00:12:03.93,00:12:03.93,And what would a day at the spa be without food?
277,00:12:06.80,00:12:06.80,"Nice, big Thai meal."
278,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,Could be a huge advantage
279,00:12:10.77,00:12:10.77,going into the last five days.
280,00:12:12.53,00:12:12.53,Worth playing for?
281,00:12:13.53,00:12:13.53,"-Yes, yes. -CLAY: Yes, sir."
282,00:12:15.33,00:12:15.33,Here's the challenge. It is a race.
283,00:12:17.23,00:12:17.23,Your goal: collect and unscramble
284,00:12:19.17,00:12:19.17,a collection of letters that spell an activity.
285,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,Here's how it works.
286,00:12:23.40,00:12:23.40," At the start, you're going  to be standing"
287,00:12:25.40,00:12:25.40, on your first of eight  English letters.
288,00:12:27.77,00:12:27.77," Unlash it, move to a trough."
289,00:12:29.97,00:12:29.97, Mixed in with  a bunch of Thai symbols
290,00:12:32.03,00:12:32.03, you will each find an  underscored English letter.
291,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20," Once you find your second  letter, move on."
292,00:12:37.37,00:12:37.37, You'll then come to a group  of flag poles.
293,00:12:39.43,00:12:39.43," Choose one, untie it.  Your next letter will release."
294,00:12:42.80,00:12:42.80,The third stop: cargo net.
295,00:12:44.97,00:12:44.97," Get up the cargo net,  get your letter, get down."
296,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17," Around the corner,  you'll find a tree."
297,00:12:51.00,00:12:51.00," Again, Thai symbols  and English letters."
298,00:12:53.07,00:12:53.07, This time they are covered  in silk.
299,00:12:54.80,00:12:54.80,Start uncovering them until you  find another English letter.
300,00:12:58.63,00:12:58.63, You're then going to move  to a rope pole.
301,00:13:01.10,00:13:01.10," There are 17 ropes, but only five of the rope poles"
302,00:13:04.20,00:13:04.20, lead to an English letter.
303,00:13:05.83,00:13:05.83, This time attached  to the letter is a key.
304,00:13:08.53,00:13:08.53, Take the letter and the key  and move to a treasure chest.
305,00:13:11.47,00:13:11.47, Use the key to unlock  the treasure chest.
306,00:13:13.97,00:13:13.97,At the bottom of the treasure chest
307,00:13:15.50,00:13:15.50,you'll find the two last letters.
308,00:13:18.63,00:13:18.63,"You'll then race to one of the easels,"
309,00:13:20.13,00:13:20.13,"like the one you're standing in front of,"
310,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50,and unscramble the letters
311,00:13:22.87,00:13:22.87,of two words that describe an activity.
312,00:13:25.77,00:13:25.77,First person to unscramble them correctly
313,00:13:27.87,00:13:27.87,"wins the Chevy Trail Blazer, the day at the spa,"
314,00:13:31.77,00:13:31.77,a break from the game.
315,00:13:33.13,00:13:33.13,Let's head over to the start. We'll get going.
316,00:13:35.83,00:13:35.83,"Here we go, guys, great reward at stake."
317,00:13:38.30,00:13:38.30,You are looking for eight letters total.
318,00:13:39.97,00:13:39.97,You're standing on the first one.

320,00:13:42.43,00:13:42.43,-JAN: Yeah. -Go!

322,00:13:48.13,00:13:48.13,You're standing on the first one.
323,00:13:50.20,00:13:50.20,"-Clay, you're right. -That's what I thought I heard you say."
324,00:13:51.97,00:13:51.97,I wasn't for sure.
325,00:13:58.83,00:13:58.83,PROBST: Clay's got his first one.
326,00:14:05.60,00:14:05.60,Where we going? Jeff?
327,00:14:06.67,00:14:06.67,"-Got to go back to get your first one, Brian. -Man, hey!"
328,00:14:08.53,00:14:08.53,-Got one underneath you. -I said you're standing
329,00:14:10.17,00:14:10.17,-on your first one. -Oh.
330,00:14:15.47,00:14:15.47,Looking for the underscore.
331,00:14:20.40,00:14:20.40,Looking for an underscore.
332,00:14:21.43,00:14:21.43,Underscore means English letter.
333,00:14:23.83,00:14:23.83,Helen's got two.
334,00:14:30.80,00:14:30.80,Ted's got two.
335,00:14:32.53,00:14:32.53,"Brian's got two, Clay's got two."
336,00:14:35.00,00:14:35.00,It's a tight race.
337,00:14:37.83,00:14:37.83,All you're doing here is untying.
338,00:14:39.73,00:14:39.73,Drop the letter.
339,00:14:44.40,00:14:44.40,Helen has her third letter.
340,00:14:46.37,00:14:46.37,Ted's got his third letter. Clay's got his third letter.
341,00:14:48.87,00:14:48.87,Brian's got his third letter.
342,00:15:00.47,00:15:00.47,"Jan, don't give up! You're still alive!"
343,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,Everybody's got four except Jan.
344,00:15:07.10,00:15:07.10,You're looking for another letter; remember the underscore.
345,00:15:09.83,00:15:09.83,"Clay's got his fifth letter, and he's off."
346,00:15:12.63,00:15:12.63,Brian's got his fifth.
347,00:15:20.40,00:15:20.40,"Clay, you got lucky on your first one."
348,00:15:24.30,00:15:24.30,"Nope, try again, Brian."
349,00:15:29.17,00:15:29.17,Brian's got one. Take the letter and the key.
350,00:15:31.80,00:15:31.80,The last two letters are in the treasure chest.
351,00:15:34.70,00:15:34.70,"-(Brian sighs) -Nice little surprise in there, huh?"
352,00:15:36.20,00:15:36.20,"-Looks like dinner, huh? -CLAY: Squid."
353,00:15:37.77,00:15:37.77,Moving to an easel. Start solving them.

379,00:16:50.90,00:16:50.90,"-How much fun is it if you can't share it, right? -True enough."
380,00:16:53.97,00:16:53.97,"But at this point, picking somebody to share it with is not"
381,00:16:57.37,00:16:57.37,-such an easy task with only five days left. -It isn't.
382,00:16:59.87,00:16:59.87,There was an immunity challenge

385,00:17:06.13,00:17:06.13,and I always told her that I owed her.
386,00:17:07.53,00:17:07.53,"So, Helen, let's have some fun, baby."

489,00:21:00.83,00:21:00.83,I didn't even get a thanks.
490,00:21:02.40,00:21:02.40,He should have thanked me.

653,00:27:17.00,00:27:17.00,would be willing to vote for Clay.
654,00:27:19.37,00:27:19.37,This is the opportunity.

662,00:27:34.80,00:27:34.80,Or if you want to tell me right before we're going

666,00:27:40.87,00:27:40.87,Then do me a favor and let me know who you're doing
667,00:27:42.43,00:27:42.43,-because if we don't vote in a block... -Okay. That's right.
668,00:27:44.93,00:27:44.93,HELEN: But just don't say  anything to Clay
669,00:27:47.10,00:27:47.10,"or to Brian that we talked,"
670,00:27:48.40,00:27:48.40,'cause that'll slit both of our throats.

672,00:27:51.53,00:27:51.53, -So... -JAN: Brian has played  a very good game.
673,00:27:53.23,00:27:53.23,"HELEN:  Yes, he has."
674,00:27:54.57,00:27:54.57,I have no problem with him.
675,00:27:55.97,00:27:55.97,Why do you think he keeps Clay so close?
676,00:27:57.87,00:27:57.87,Keep your friends close;
677,00:27:59.43,00:27:59.43,-you keep your enemies closer. -Mm-hmm.

687,00:28:25.73,00:28:25.73,Then he wanted to stay up and talk all night.
688,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,I was like... (whimpers)
689,00:28:28.57,00:28:28.57,"BRIAN: Helen could very well  be playing me,"
690,00:28:30.43,00:28:30.43," but at the same time,  she won't."
691,00:28:32.60,00:28:32.60, Helen is somebody  that respects me completely.
692,00:28:34.47,00:28:34.47, I've taken her a long way.
693,00:28:36.20,00:28:36.20,"She owes me, and she knows it."

696,00:28:42.60,00:28:42.60,-Or give a... the wrong impression. -Okay.
697,00:28:44.83,00:28:44.83,"I have a feeling, if Clay sees me talking to Ted at all..."
698,00:28:46.77,00:28:46.77,"Right. I've already had to, uh,"
699,00:28:48.30,00:28:48.30,say you're going to be fine and not to worry.
700,00:28:50.30,00:28:50.30,"Don't... I mean, I'm locked."
701,00:28:51.87,00:28:51.87,HELEN: I'm definitely playing  two sides of the fence.
702,00:28:53.87,00:28:53.87," Yeah, that's what  you got to do."

704,00:28:56.53,00:28:56.53,everybody out here is playing both sides of the fence.
705,00:28:58.30,00:28:58.30,Just hope you don't get caught.
706,00:28:59.47,00:28:59.47,"Now, I sat and listened to everything he said,"
707,00:29:01.37,00:29:01.37,and I yeah-yeah-yeahed him to death.
708,00:29:02.73,00:29:02.73,"-Yeah, I know. I know that you... -Agreed, agreed, agreed."
709,00:29:04.73,00:29:04.73,-Let Ted believe what he thinks he believes. -Yep.
710,00:29:07.43,00:29:07.43,"HELEN: Ted thinks I'm solidly  in his court, and I may be."

719,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00, of a ten-step staircase.
720,00:29:46.43,00:29:46.43," The only problem is,"
721,00:29:48.07,00:29:48.07, the steps to the staircase  are not finished.
722,00:29:50.83,00:29:50.83, Ten missing pieces  are out in the field.
723,00:29:53.13,00:29:53.13, Each piece is unique  and will only fit in one step.
724,00:29:56.53,00:29:56.53," You gather your missing pieces  one at a time,"

804,00:34:40.63,00:34:40.63,"I told you, I'm not sure the deal with--"
805,00:34:42.40,00:34:42.40,like I said before-- Clay and H.
806,00:34:44.63,00:34:44.63,"Unless something changes, I'll let you know."
807,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,"All right, cool. I just wanted to..."
808,00:34:49.23,00:34:49.23,I figured you're the only person
809,00:34:50.63,00:34:50.63,that would give me a straight-up answer.
810,00:34:52.20,00:34:52.20,"I told you, I'm not sure what's up with them."
811,00:34:54.57,00:34:54.57,I'm not sure about that.
812,00:34:55.87,00:34:55.87,Yeah. Yeah.
813,00:34:56.93,00:34:56.93,"So, anyway..."
814,00:34:58.73,00:34:58.73,"So, targeting... Jan?"
815,00:35:01.93,00:35:01.93,-Janny. -Okay.
816,00:35:04.00,00:35:04.00,"JAN: Those are really pretty, Teddy."
817,00:35:05.67,00:35:05.67,"I got one with nature, and it was just beautiful,"
818,00:35:08.27,00:35:08.27,hunting for rocks and everything.
819,00:35:10.63,00:35:10.63,JAN: Those are really cool.
820,00:35:13.13,00:35:13.13,"How about picking one of these,"
821,00:35:15.13,00:35:15.13,with the exception of this one and that one?
822,00:35:16.73,00:35:16.73,-Yeah. Give me one. -Here.
823,00:35:18.50,00:35:18.50,"Okay, Teddy."
824,00:35:20.50,00:35:20.50,"JAN: Helen had come to me  because, if you look at it,"
825,00:35:23.63,00:35:23.63,it's... I could be a swing vote.
826,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27," You know, if Helen and Ted  had an alliance,"
827,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83," they could pull me,  and we could vote Clay out."
828,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67," I really have to think  about it,"
829,00:35:34.53,00:35:34.53,and I would think about it from the standpoint
830,00:35:36.97,00:35:36.97,of what would be best for me in the long run.
831,00:35:39.40,00:35:39.40," I'm not sure there's any true,  true alliance right now."
832,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43," I think people are talking,"
833,00:35:45.30,00:35:45.30," but I don't think  the word ""alliance""--"
834,00:35:47.87,00:35:47.87," that ""I will not vote  against you""--"
835,00:35:50.13,00:35:50.13, has ever really been said  by any of the five.
836,00:35:52.87,00:35:52.87," You know, Helen and I  are very, very tight,"
837,00:35:55.47,00:35:55.47, but trust at this point  in the game--
838,00:35:58.27,00:35:58.27," it's very hard,  and it's a very thin line."
839,00:36:00.83,00:36:00.83, And I might trust you
840,00:36:02.73,00:36:02.73," with everything  in another situation,"
841,00:36:04.60,00:36:04.60," but this is a game,  so even if someone"
842,00:36:07.23,00:36:07.23,"tells you something, they might not do it."
843,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,"Hey, we got to be careful with my pot holder socks"
844,00:36:12.40,00:36:12.40,"since they actually, technically,"
845,00:36:13.43,00:36:13.43,are still socks that I wear.
846,00:36:15.37,00:36:15.37,Someone's burning them again.
847,00:36:16.90,00:36:16.90,"-I got a... I got a new, uh, burn in them. -JAN: Hmm."
848,00:36:19.63,00:36:19.63,"BRIAN: When you know  where everyone's head's at,"
849,00:36:22.30,00:36:22.30," it gives you  that much more control,"
850,00:36:23.93,00:36:23.93," gives you that much more  confidence,"
851,00:36:26.07,00:36:26.07," it gives you  a little bit more, uh..."
852,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83," uh, more useful ammunition."
853,00:36:29.73,00:36:29.73,I've got three pieces of ammunition I can use.
854,00:36:32.00,00:36:32.00,"One, I've got my trump card, Jan."
855,00:36:34.87,00:36:34.87,"Grandma Jan, she's disposable."
856,00:36:36.57,00:36:36.57,Looking good on that black!
857,00:36:38.90,00:36:38.90,"-Ooh, yeah. Sharp. -Stylish!"
858,00:36:41.23,00:36:41.23,"Oh, boy. Yeah."
859,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,"Number two, I've got my loyal and trustworthy soldier, Helen."
860,00:36:47.43,00:36:47.43, I know where her head's at.  I know how she feels about me.
861,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83," I'm very confident and, uh,"
862,00:36:51.83,00:36:51.83, good feeling about her  and her work ethic.
863,00:36:54.27,00:36:54.27,"My good friend, Uncle Clay."
864,00:36:56.63,00:36:56.63, I know what he wants;  he knows what I want.
865,00:36:58.47,00:36:58.47, I know he doesn't want Helen.  I know Helen doesn't want him.
866,00:37:00.87,00:37:00.87," When I need to use that  against each other, I will,"
867,00:37:03.40,00:37:03.40," but in the meantime,  I'm just sitting back."
868,00:37:06.10,00:37:06.10, So there's my three--  those are my three ins.
869,00:37:08.70,00:37:08.70,"One disposable, a loyal soldier..."
870,00:37:12.57,00:37:12.57,Oops. And a good friend.
871,00:37:14.10,00:37:14.10,(chuckling)
872,00:37:18.87,00:37:18.87,"CLAY: Uh, really, if you get  to thinking about it,"
873,00:37:21.13,00:37:21.13, using people in this game--  isn't everybody
874,00:37:22.73,00:37:22.73, getting used  in one way or the 'nother?
875,00:37:24.83,00:37:24.83, That's the name of this game.
876,00:37:26.23,00:37:26.23, Use everybody you can  on your way to the top.
877,00:37:28.87,00:37:28.87,Here we go again.
878,00:37:30.03,00:37:30.03,The circus has come to town.
879,00:37:49.87,00:37:49.87,We'll now bring in our jury.
880,00:37:52.37,00:37:52.37,"Erin, Ken, Penny and Jake."
881,00:38:02.73,00:38:02.73,"Think about it-- five of you,"
882,00:38:05.43,00:38:05.43,five Chuay Gahn members still in the quest for a million dollars
883,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,and the title of sole Survivor.
884,00:38:11.20,00:38:11.20,"Directly across from you,"
885,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,"four people, the four members of our jury,"
886,00:38:15.30,00:38:15.30,"all four Sook Jai members, all four voted out by you,"
887,00:38:19.60,00:38:19.60,"and up until tonight, you were in control."
888,00:38:22.30,00:38:22.30,"Chuay Gahn had the numbers, and systematically, one by one,"
889,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,"you eliminated them and in doing so,"
890,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,put your fate in their hands.
891,00:38:29.57,00:38:29.57,"That is now the majority of the jury,"
892,00:38:32.30,00:38:32.30,and I wonder how that feels
893,00:38:35.33,00:38:35.33,to be sitting there knowing
894,00:38:37.53,00:38:37.53,it may be too late to do anything about it.
895,00:38:39.83,00:38:39.83,"Clay, how does it feel?"
896,00:38:41.33,00:38:41.33,"Uh, scary, and, and believe me,"
897,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,I laid awake at night a lot and thought about that.
898,00:38:47.43,00:38:47.43,"Uh, they've got to vote for somebody."
899,00:38:49.00,00:38:49.00,I just hope I'm one of the two
900,00:38:50.93,00:38:50.93,"that they're, they're voting for."
901,00:38:52.63,00:38:52.63,"That's the only thing I can hope for, is to try"
902,00:38:54.30,00:38:54.30,to figure how to get to the top the easiest
903,00:38:55.83,00:38:55.83,"and, and the best way for Clay to do it,"
904,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03,"and, uh, that's what I'm searching for."
905,00:39:00.27,00:39:00.27,"Helen, how do you win this game?"
906,00:39:02.20,00:39:02.20,"Um... they have the numbers, that's right,"
907,00:39:06.53,00:39:06.53,"but they also have to vote for one of the two,"
908,00:39:08.40,00:39:08.40,"and unfortunately for them,"
909,00:39:09.63,00:39:09.63,one of the two is going to be a Chuay Gahn member.
910,00:39:11.47,00:39:11.47,"I'm hoping that when it comes down to voting, um,"
911,00:39:15.23,00:39:15.23,"that they vote on, uh, merit--"
912,00:39:17.43,00:39:17.43,"who pulled their weight, who was a good member to be around."
913,00:39:21.47,00:39:21.47,"Brian, you've been out here 36 days now."
914,00:39:24.43,00:39:24.43,"In a sense, is your fate sealed within this tribe?"
915,00:39:27.63,00:39:27.63,"Uh, no, nobody's fate's ever sealed"
916,00:39:29.83,00:39:29.83,"until the, uh, fat lady sings, as I like to say."
917,00:39:32.80,00:39:32.80,"There's, uh, still a couple days left,"
918,00:39:34.93,00:39:34.93,and I can't predict the future.
919,00:39:36.73,00:39:36.73,"Uh, who knows what's going to happen?"
920,00:39:38.37,00:39:38.37,"PROBST: Jan, you put this tribe together."
921,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,Is there an added burden on you when it comes to voting?
922,00:39:45.20,00:39:45.20,"Yes, I feel very much so because I've grown with this tribe."
923,00:39:50.07,00:39:50.07,"We scraped and fought our way to keep together, so"
924,00:39:54.97,00:39:54.97,it's very hard to have to vote someone off
925,00:39:58.97,00:39:58.97,that has worked very hard.
926,00:40:00.87,00:40:00.87,There's very little difference between any of the five of us.
927,00:40:04.00,00:40:04.00,It is time to vote.
928,00:40:05.00,00:40:05.00,"Jan, you're up."
929,00:40:23.93,00:40:23.93,"You're a fierce competitor and so am I,"
930,00:40:26.10,00:40:26.10," which means  if it's down to you or me,"
931,00:40:27.37,00:40:27.37,it's going to be you before me.
932,00:40:38.43,00:40:38.43,"Nothing but strategy,"
933,00:40:40.43,00:40:40.43, and it's time for you to go.
934,00:40:41.87,00:40:41.87, Good-bye.
935,00:40:55.43,00:40:55.43,I'll go tally the votes.
936,00:41:06.33,00:41:06.33,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
937,00:41:08.27,00:41:08.27,The person will be asked
938,00:41:09.43,00:41:09.43,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
939,00:41:11.50,00:41:11.50,I'll read the votes.
940,00:41:16.27,00:41:16.27,First vote-- Ted.
941,00:41:24.27,00:41:24.27,Ted. That's two votes-- Ted.
942,00:41:31.40,00:41:31.40,"Jan. One vote-- Jan, two votes-- Ted."
943,00:41:41.57,00:41:41.57,Ted.
944,00:41:45.53,00:41:45.53,No need to read the last vote.
945,00:41:46.63,00:41:46.63,You need to bring me your torch.
946,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,"TED: Take care, guys."
947,00:41:56.30,00:41:56.30,"Ted, the tribe has spoken."
948,00:41:58.70,00:41:58.70,"Thanks for everything, man."
949,00:42:01.00,00:42:01.00,I appreciate it. Take care.
950,00:42:02.80,00:42:02.80,"All right, you guys, take care."
951,00:42:17.33,00:42:17.33,"Well, you've lasted 36 days."
952,00:42:19.67,00:42:19.67,You have made it to the final four.
953,00:42:21.27,00:42:21.27,Here's what's left.
954,00:42:22.53,00:42:22.53,"Over the next three days, there will be three Tribal Councils,"
955,00:42:25.30,00:42:25.30,"two immunity challenges, one winner."
956,00:42:28.57,00:42:28.57,That winner will be determined by that jury.
957,00:42:33.50,00:42:33.50,You guys can head back to camp.
958,00:42:34.60,00:42:34.60,Good night.
959,00:42:46.13,00:42:46.13,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
960,00:42:52.20,00:42:52.20,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
961,00:42:54.57,00:42:54.57, Only four remain...
962,00:42:56.57,00:42:56.57,"CLAY: Y'all, there's only four torches."
963,00:42:57.90,00:42:57.90,PROBST: ...and it's down to the  last three days on the island.
964,00:43:00.67,00:43:00.67,"HELEN:  At this level in the game,"
965,00:43:02.20,00:43:02.20," it becomes cutthroat, so  the next couple days I expect"
966,00:43:04.30,00:43:04.30,to be extremely stressful.
967,00:43:05.83,00:43:05.83,PROBST:  Join us for a two-hour finale
968,00:43:08.07,00:43:08.07, and find out  who will be the sole Survivor.
969,00:43:17.37,00:43:17.37,This has been a long and wonderful trip.
970,00:43:21.33,00:43:21.33, I was truly blessed  to make it this far.
971,00:43:23.47,00:43:23.47," Sure, I would have loved  to have won, but it's okay."
972,00:43:26.67,00:43:26.67, I sucked it all in  and I have no regrets.
973,00:43:29.80,00:43:29.80," To my baby Morgan, I did this"
974,00:43:32.87,00:43:32.87,to show you that nothing beats a failure but a try.
