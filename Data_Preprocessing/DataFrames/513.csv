1,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.53,00:00:03.53, Clay gave Jake a piece of his mind.
3,00:00:05.13,00:00:05.13,I didn't like that statement
4,00:00:06.87,00:00:06.87,worth a ... up at thatcouncil meeting.
5,00:00:08.53,00:00:08.53,"I'll put my production up,basically, against anybody's."
6,00:00:11.37,00:00:11.37, And that offended Clay.
7,00:00:13.13,00:00:13.13,PROBST: The tribe was surprised to find
8,00:00:14.70,00:00:14.70, their loved ones at the reward challenge.
9,00:00:17.90,00:00:17.90, But even more surprised when the family members
10,00:00:20.27,00:00:20.27, had to compete against each other.
11,00:00:22.13,00:00:22.13,There's that juice.
12,00:00:23.27,00:00:23.27, It was Helen's husband Jim who stomached the victory
13,00:00:27.63,00:00:27.63, and became an honorary tribe member for a day.
14,00:00:30.20,00:00:30.20," With Jim as a confidant,"
15,00:00:32.60,00:00:32.60, Helen had a chance to talk about strategy.
16,00:00:35.33,00:00:35.33,Brian'll play fair; Clay won't.
17,00:00:37.87,00:00:37.87,Clay's a selfish son of a gun.
18,00:00:39.27,00:00:39.27,"PROBST: At the immunity challenge,"
19,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00, the tribe was surprised again.

21,00:00:45.43,00:00:45.43,"PROBST: This time, castaways and family members"
22,00:00:47.27,00:00:47.27," competed together,"
23,00:00:48.73,00:00:48.73, and brotherly teamwork paid off for Ted.
24,00:00:51.37,00:00:51.37,-Big Ted!-(shouting)
25,00:00:53.57,00:00:53.57," Before Tribal Council, Helen approached Brian"
26,00:00:55.77,00:00:55.77, with her concerns about Clay.
27,00:00:58.40,00:00:58.40,Do you feel that he has
28,00:00:59.83,00:00:59.83,earned a number one or two spot?
29,00:01:03.03,00:01:03.03,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, despite a campaign"
30,00:01:05.40,00:01:05.40," to get rid of Clay,"
31,00:01:06.63,00:01:06.63, Jake was voted out of the tribe.
32,00:01:08.73,00:01:08.73,The tribe has spoken.
33,00:01:11.27,00:01:11.27, The five former members of Chuay Gahn
34,00:01:13.57,00:01:13.57, are all that remain.
35,00:01:15.20,00:01:15.20," Tonight, one of them will go."
36,00:03:03.40,00:03:03.40,JAN:34 days.
37,00:03:05.10,00:03:05.10,Five to go.
38,00:03:07.13,00:03:07.13,HELEN: We haven't been to Tribal Council
39,00:03:09.67,00:03:09.67, to vote off a Chuay Gahn member since day 12.
40,00:03:13.20,00:03:13.20,"Chuay Gahn, who started out asthe joke team of Survivor,"
41,00:03:17.13,00:03:17.13," as the losers, as the old people,"
42,00:03:19.80,00:03:19.80," as the ones that, you know what,"
43,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17," ""You band of misfits,"
44,00:03:22.53,00:03:22.53," you can't  do anything right."""
45,00:03:25.33,00:03:25.33,But we never lost focusand we never gave up.
46,00:03:27.43,00:03:27.43,TED: The core of Chuay Gahnis right here.
47,00:03:30.60,00:03:30.60,CLAY:Yep.
48,00:03:31.80,00:03:31.80,"If it wasn't for us,"
49,00:03:34.50,00:03:34.50,we would have been extinct.
50,00:03:36.00,00:03:36.00,"HELEN: And now, definitely, the game is on."
51,00:03:39.37,00:03:39.37," Jake left, now it's Chuay Gahn,"
52,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57, now we have to vote each other out.
53,00:03:43.27,00:03:43.27," The game is on,"
54,00:03:44.37,00:03:44.37,full speed ahead.
55,00:03:45.73,00:03:45.73,(whistling tune)
56,00:03:48.27,00:03:48.27,BRIAN: What skills come into play
57,00:03:50.10,00:03:50.10, at this part of the game?
58,00:03:51.70,00:03:51.70,Skating skills.Who's the best skater?
59,00:03:54.40,00:03:54.40,Ice skater.
60,00:03:55.57,00:03:55.57," Who's got the longest skates on,"
61,00:03:57.37,00:03:57.37," who's the best at cutting  corners, going around circles?"
62,00:04:01.50,00:04:01.50,Because usually on skating yougot to be ice cold.
63,00:04:03.90,00:04:03.90," You can't lose your cool, you got to be like ice."
64,00:04:06.53,00:04:06.53," You're going to have friendships,"
65,00:04:07.77,00:04:07.77, you got to cut off those friendships.
66,00:04:09.43,00:04:09.43," You got to keep stringing people along,"
67,00:04:10.80,00:04:10.80, and-- bam!-- throw them a nice slider.

69,00:04:15.10,00:04:15.10,"Even though it's about 110 outhere, I've got my skates on."

102,00:05:30.47,00:05:30.47,JAN: When I first saw my own picture I started laughing

204,00:08:54.67,00:08:54.67,"Lookee, lookee, lookee!"
205,00:08:56.43,00:08:56.43,We haven't even opened it.
206,00:08:58.17,00:08:58.17,We haven't opened it.I just opened it.

216,00:09:25.13,00:09:25.13,Oh...

218,00:09:28.97,00:09:28.97,"if you're hungry,tired and sore."""
219,00:09:31.03,00:09:31.03,"Well, that's me.Who's always asking about food?"
220,00:09:33.60,00:09:33.60,-So y'all just...-You don't get any more food!
221,00:09:35.53,00:09:35.53,You've already had yours.
222,00:09:37.57,00:09:37.57,"You've had your food.Sorry, so you're done."
223,00:09:39.50,00:09:39.50,"TED: With me, on those that I've trusted"
224,00:09:43.10,00:09:43.10," up until this point, I want to continue to trust,"
225,00:09:45.57,00:09:45.57," maybe 80, 85%."
226,00:09:47.57,00:09:47.57,But I'm not going to sit back
227,00:09:50.10,00:09:50.10,and just base the results ofthis game on that trust.
228,00:10:03.63,00:10:03.63, One of my strategies from day one
229,00:10:05.57,00:10:05.57, was to adapt to any given situation.
230,00:10:10.30,00:10:10.30, So I wanted to communicate with Helen
231,00:10:12.40,00:10:12.40, and ask herher feelings of who she thought
232,00:10:14.37,00:10:14.37,the top four would be.
233,00:10:16.80,00:10:16.80," And I started drawing in thesand, the alternative option is"
234,00:10:20.53,00:10:20.53," to eliminate Clay and bring Helen, myself and Janny"
235,00:10:25.13,00:10:25.13," in the final four,"
236,00:10:27.53,00:10:27.53, then make a decision on how we want to operate
237,00:10:30.67,00:10:30.67," with Brian, you know, whether we want"
238,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17, to keep him or whether we want to
239,00:10:34.53,00:10:34.53,"you know, vote him out."
240,00:10:35.73,00:10:35.73, And it was good for me to know
241,00:10:38.17,00:10:38.17," that she was basically on the same thought path as I was,"
242,00:10:41.63,00:10:41.63, as far as Clay's contribution to the tribe.
243,00:10:44.93,00:10:44.93, Clay doesn't do anything.  He lays around all day.
244,00:10:48.63,00:10:48.63," He doesn't go out, get wood."
245,00:10:51.13,00:10:51.13," He doesn't go out for the water hole, he does nothing."
246,00:10:54.17,00:10:54.17," He just lays around all day, so..."
247,00:10:56.30,00:10:56.30," So logically, he would be the next, in my mind,"
248,00:10:58.43,00:10:58.43, the next person to get voted out.
249,00:11:07.23,00:11:07.23,"Hey, guys!"
250,00:11:08.80,00:11:08.80,(shouting and laughter)
251,00:11:10.13,00:11:10.13,What do you think of the ride?
252,00:11:11.43,00:11:11.43,"Let's go.Big Ted, take the front."
253,00:11:12.90,00:11:12.90,Oh!
254,00:11:15.47,00:11:15.47,Lord have mercy.
255,00:11:16.97,00:11:16.97,"Get on in, baby.This is what you're playing for."
256,00:11:20.20,00:11:20.20,"-Oh, my God!-Ow!"
257,00:11:22.13,00:11:22.13,"HELEN:Oh, it's got that new car smell."
258,00:11:24.03,00:11:24.03,JAN:Whoa!
259,00:11:25.33,00:11:25.33,Ah!
260,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,Kind of a heavy foot there.
261,00:11:29.20,00:11:29.20,(screaming)
262,00:11:32.23,00:11:32.23,This is what I'm talking about.
263,00:11:34.33,00:11:34.33,CLAY:Whoa!
264,00:11:35.77,00:11:35.77,"JAN:Oh, my God."
265,00:11:38.93,00:11:38.93,I don't want to get out.It fits too good.
266,00:11:41.33,00:11:41.33,Hop out. We got achallenge to do.
267,00:11:47.07,00:11:47.07,First things first.
268,00:11:48.53,00:11:48.53,"Let's talk about this SUV.Not a bad-looking ride, huh?"
269,00:11:51.23,00:11:51.23,-JAN: Uh-uh. Gorgeous.-Perfect. Perfect. 
270,00:11:53.10,00:11:53.10,The winner will winthe Chevy Trail Blazer.
271,00:11:55.93,00:11:55.93,The other part of the reward is
272,00:11:58.40,00:11:58.40,"a day at a spa, Survivor style."
273,00:12:00.77,00:12:00.77,Ah...
274,00:12:01.77,00:12:01.77,-We've also arrangedfor a nice massage. -(gasps)
275,00:12:03.93,00:12:03.93,And what would a day at the spabe without food?
276,00:12:06.80,00:12:06.80,"Nice, big Thai meal."
277,00:12:09.17,00:12:09.17,Could be a huge advantage
278,00:12:10.77,00:12:10.77,going into the last five days.
279,00:12:12.53,00:12:12.53,Worth playing for?
280,00:12:13.53,00:12:13.53,"-Yes, yes.-CLAY: Yes, sir."
281,00:12:15.33,00:12:15.33,Here's the challenge.It is a race.
282,00:12:17.23,00:12:17.23,Your goal: collectand unscramble
283,00:12:19.17,00:12:19.17,a collection of lettersthat spell an activity.
284,00:12:22.17,00:12:22.17,Here's how it works.
285,00:12:23.40,00:12:23.40," At the start, you're going to be standing"
286,00:12:25.40,00:12:25.40, on your first of eight English letters.
287,00:12:27.77,00:12:27.77," Unlash it, move to a trough."
288,00:12:29.97,00:12:29.97, Mixed in with a bunch of Thai symbols
289,00:12:32.03,00:12:32.03, you will each find an underscored English letter.
290,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20," Once you find your second letter, move on."
291,00:12:37.37,00:12:37.37, You'll then come to a group of flag poles.
292,00:12:39.43,00:12:39.43," Choose one, untie it. Your next letter will release."
293,00:12:42.80,00:12:42.80,The third stop: cargo net.
294,00:12:44.97,00:12:44.97," Get up the cargo net, get your letter, get down."
295,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17," Around the corner, you'll find a tree."
296,00:12:51.00,00:12:51.00," Again, Thai symbols and English letters."
297,00:12:53.07,00:12:53.07, This time they are covered in silk.
298,00:12:54.80,00:12:54.80,Start uncovering them until you find another English letter.
299,00:12:58.63,00:12:58.63, You're then going to move to a rope pole.
300,00:13:01.10,00:13:01.10," There are 17 ropes,but only five of the rope poles"
301,00:13:04.20,00:13:04.20, lead to an English letter.
302,00:13:05.83,00:13:05.83, This time attached to the letter is a key.
303,00:13:08.53,00:13:08.53, Take the letter and the key and move to a treasure chest.
304,00:13:11.47,00:13:11.47, Use the key to unlock the treasure chest.
305,00:13:13.97,00:13:13.97,At the bottomof the treasure chest
306,00:13:15.50,00:13:15.50,you'll findthe two last letters.
307,00:13:18.63,00:13:18.63,"You'll then raceto one of the easels,"
308,00:13:20.13,00:13:20.13,"like the one you'restanding in front of,"
309,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50,and unscramble the letters
310,00:13:22.87,00:13:22.87,of two wordsthat describe an activity.
311,00:13:25.77,00:13:25.77,First person to unscramblethem correctly

331,00:14:21.43,00:14:21.43,Underscore means English letter.

335,00:14:35.00,00:14:35.00,It's a tight race.
336,00:14:37.83,00:14:37.83,All you're doing hereis untying.

807,00:34:49.23,00:34:49.23,I figured you're the only person
808,00:34:50.63,00:34:50.63,that would give mea straight-up answer.
809,00:34:52.20,00:34:52.20,"I told you, I'm not surewhat's up with them."
810,00:34:54.57,00:34:54.57,I'm not sure about that.
811,00:34:55.87,00:34:55.87,Yeah. Yeah.
812,00:34:56.93,00:34:56.93,"So, anyway..."
813,00:34:58.73,00:34:58.73,"So, targeting... Jan?"
814,00:35:01.93,00:35:01.93,-Janny.-Okay.
815,00:35:04.00,00:35:04.00,"JAN:Those are really pretty, Teddy."
816,00:35:05.67,00:35:05.67,"I got one with nature,and it was just beautiful,"
817,00:35:08.27,00:35:08.27,hunting for rocksand everything.
818,00:35:10.63,00:35:10.63,JAN:Those are really cool.
819,00:35:13.13,00:35:13.13,"How about picking one of these,"
820,00:35:15.13,00:35:15.13,with the exceptionof this one and that one?
821,00:35:16.73,00:35:16.73,-Yeah. Give me one.-Here.
822,00:35:18.50,00:35:18.50,"Okay, Teddy."
823,00:35:20.50,00:35:20.50,"JAN: Helen had come to me because, if you look at it,"
824,00:35:23.63,00:35:23.63,it's... I could be a swing vote.
825,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27," You know, if Helen and Ted had an alliance,"
826,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83," they could pull me, and we could vote Clay out."
827,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67," I really have to think about it,"
828,00:35:34.53,00:35:34.53,and I would think about itfrom the standpoint
829,00:35:36.97,00:35:36.97,of what would be bestfor me in the long run.
830,00:35:39.40,00:35:39.40," I'm not sure there's any true, true alliance right now."
831,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43," I think people are talking,"
832,00:35:45.30,00:35:45.30," but I don't think the word ""alliance""--"
833,00:35:47.87,00:35:47.87," that ""I will not vote against you""--"
834,00:35:50.13,00:35:50.13, has ever really been said by any of the five.
835,00:35:52.87,00:35:52.87," You know, Helen and I are very, very tight,"
836,00:35:55.47,00:35:55.47, but trust at this point in the game--
837,00:35:58.27,00:35:58.27," it's very hard, and it's a very thin line."
838,00:36:00.83,00:36:00.83, And I might trust you
839,00:36:02.73,00:36:02.73," with everything in another situation,"
840,00:36:04.60,00:36:04.60," but this is a game, so even if someone"
841,00:36:07.23,00:36:07.23,"tells you something,they might not do it."
842,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,"Hey, we got to be carefulwith my pot holder socks"
843,00:36:12.40,00:36:12.40,"since they actually,technically,"
844,00:36:13.43,00:36:13.43,are still socks that I wear.
845,00:36:15.37,00:36:15.37,Someone's burning them again.
846,00:36:16.90,00:36:16.90,"-I got a... I got a new, uh,burn in them. -JAN: Hmm."
847,00:36:19.63,00:36:19.63,"BRIAN: When you know where everyone's head's at,"
848,00:36:22.30,00:36:22.30," it gives you that much more control,"
849,00:36:23.93,00:36:23.93," gives you that much more confidence,"
850,00:36:26.07,00:36:26.07," it gives you a little bit more, uh..."
851,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83," uh, more useful ammunition."
852,00:36:29.73,00:36:29.73,I've got three piecesof ammunition I can use.
853,00:36:32.00,00:36:32.00,"One, I've gotmy trump card, Jan."
854,00:36:34.87,00:36:34.87,"Grandma Jan, she's disposable."
855,00:36:36.57,00:36:36.57,Looking good on that black!
856,00:36:38.90,00:36:38.90,"-Ooh, yeah. Sharp.-Stylish!"
857,00:36:41.23,00:36:41.23,"Oh, boy. Yeah."
858,00:36:44.00,00:36:44.00,"Number two, I've got my loyaland trustworthy soldier, Helen."
859,00:36:47.43,00:36:47.43, I know where her head's at. I know how she feels about me.
860,00:36:49.83,00:36:49.83," I'm very confident and, uh,"
861,00:36:51.83,00:36:51.83, good feeling about her and her work ethic.
862,00:36:54.27,00:36:54.27,"My good friend, Uncle Clay."
863,00:36:56.63,00:36:56.63, I know what he wants; he knows what I want.
864,00:36:58.47,00:36:58.47, I know he doesn't want Helen. I know Helen doesn't want him.
865,00:37:00.87,00:37:00.87," When I need to use that against each other, I will,"
866,00:37:03.40,00:37:03.40," but in the meantime, I'm just sitting back."
867,00:37:06.10,00:37:06.10, So there's my three-- those are my three ins.
868,00:37:08.70,00:37:08.70,"One disposable,a loyal soldier..."
869,00:37:12.57,00:37:12.57,Oops. And a good friend.
870,00:37:14.10,00:37:14.10,(chuckling)
871,00:37:18.87,00:37:18.87,"CLAY: Uh, really, if you get to thinking about it,"
872,00:37:21.13,00:37:21.13, using people in this game-- isn't everybody
873,00:37:22.73,00:37:22.73, getting used in one way or the 'nother?
874,00:37:24.83,00:37:24.83, That's the name of this game.
875,00:37:26.23,00:37:26.23, Use everybody you can on your way to the top.
876,00:37:28.87,00:37:28.87,Here we go again.
877,00:37:30.03,00:37:30.03,The circus has come to town.
878,00:37:49.87,00:37:49.87,We'll now bring in our jury.
879,00:37:52.37,00:37:52.37,"Erin, Ken, Penny and Jake."
880,00:38:02.73,00:38:02.73,"Think about it-- five of you,"
881,00:38:05.43,00:38:05.43,five Chuay Gahn members still inthe quest for a million dollars
882,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90,and the title of sole Survivor.
883,00:38:11.20,00:38:11.20,"Directly across from you,"
884,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,"four people,the four members of our jury,"
885,00:38:15.30,00:38:15.30,"all four Sook Jai members,all four voted out by you,"
886,00:38:19.60,00:38:19.60,"and up until tonight,you were in control."
887,00:38:22.30,00:38:22.30,"Chuay Gahn had the numbers,and systematically, one by one,"
888,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,"you eliminated themand in doing so,"
889,00:38:27.33,00:38:27.33,put your fate in their hands.
890,00:38:29.57,00:38:29.57,"That is now the majorityof the jury,"
891,00:38:32.30,00:38:32.30,and I wonder how that feels
892,00:38:35.33,00:38:35.33,to be sitting there knowing
893,00:38:37.53,00:38:37.53,it may be too lateto do anything about it.
894,00:38:39.83,00:38:39.83,"Clay, how does it feel?"
895,00:38:41.33,00:38:41.33,"Uh, scary, and, and believe me,"
896,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,I laid awake at night a lotand thought about that.
897,00:38:47.43,00:38:47.43,"Uh, they've gotto vote for somebody."
898,00:38:49.00,00:38:49.00,I just hope I'm one of the two
899,00:38:50.93,00:38:50.93,"that they're,they're voting for."
900,00:38:52.63,00:38:52.63,"That's the only thingI can hope for, is to try"
901,00:38:54.30,00:38:54.30,to figure how to getto the top the easiest
902,00:38:55.83,00:38:55.83,"and, and the best wayfor Clay to do it,"
903,00:38:58.03,00:38:58.03,"and, uh, that'swhat I'm searching for."
904,00:39:00.27,00:39:00.27,"Helen, how do you win this game?"
905,00:39:02.20,00:39:02.20,"Um... they have the numbers,that's right,"
906,00:39:06.53,00:39:06.53,"but they also have to votefor one of the two,"
907,00:39:08.40,00:39:08.40,"and unfortunately for them,"
908,00:39:09.63,00:39:09.63,one of the two is goingto be a Chuay Gahn member.
909,00:39:11.47,00:39:11.47,"I'm hoping that when it comesdown to voting, um,"
910,00:39:15.23,00:39:15.23,"that they vote on, uh, merit--"
911,00:39:17.43,00:39:17.43,"who pulled their weight, who wasa good member to be around."
912,00:39:21.47,00:39:21.47,"Brian, you've been out here36 days now."
913,00:39:24.43,00:39:24.43,"In a sense, is your fate sealedwithin this tribe?"
914,00:39:27.63,00:39:27.63,"Uh, no, nobody's fate'sever sealed"
915,00:39:29.83,00:39:29.83,"until the, uh, fat lady sings,as I like to say."
916,00:39:32.80,00:39:32.80,"There's, uh, stilla couple days left,"
917,00:39:34.93,00:39:34.93,and I can't predict the future.
918,00:39:36.73,00:39:36.73,"Uh, who knowswhat's going to happen?"
919,00:39:38.37,00:39:38.37,"PROBST: Jan, you putthis tribe together."
920,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,Is there an added burden on youwhen it comes to voting?
921,00:39:45.20,00:39:45.20,"Yes, I feel very much so becauseI've grown with this tribe."
922,00:39:50.07,00:39:50.07,"We scraped and fought our wayto keep together, so"
923,00:39:54.97,00:39:54.97,it's very hardto have to vote someone off
924,00:39:58.97,00:39:58.97,that has worked very hard.
925,00:40:00.87,00:40:00.87,There's very little differencebetween any of the five of us.
926,00:40:04.00,00:40:04.00,It is time to vote.
927,00:40:05.00,00:40:05.00,"Jan, you're up."
928,00:40:23.93,00:40:23.93,"You're a fierce competitorand so am I,"
929,00:40:26.10,00:40:26.10," which means if it's down to you or me,"
930,00:40:27.37,00:40:27.37,it's going to be you before me.
931,00:40:38.43,00:40:38.43,"Nothing but strategy,"
932,00:40:40.43,00:40:40.43, and it's time for you to go.
933,00:40:41.87,00:40:41.87, Good-bye.
934,00:40:55.43,00:40:55.43,I'll go tally the votes.
935,00:41:06.33,00:41:06.33,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
936,00:41:08.27,00:41:08.27,The person will be asked
937,00:41:09.43,00:41:09.43,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
938,00:41:11.50,00:41:11.50,I'll read the votes.
939,00:41:16.27,00:41:16.27,First vote-- Ted.
940,00:41:24.27,00:41:24.27,Ted.That's two votes-- Ted.
941,00:41:31.40,00:41:31.40,"Jan.One vote-- Jan, two votes-- Ted."
942,00:41:41.57,00:41:41.57,Ted.
943,00:41:45.53,00:41:45.53,No need to read the last vote.
944,00:41:46.63,00:41:46.63,You need to bring me your torch.
945,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,"TED:Take care, guys."
946,00:41:56.30,00:41:56.30,"Ted, the tribe has spoken."
947,00:41:58.70,00:41:58.70,"Thanks for everything, man."
948,00:42:01.00,00:42:01.00,I appreciate it.Take care.
949,00:42:02.80,00:42:02.80,"All right, you guys, take care."
950,00:42:17.33,00:42:17.33,"Well, you've lasted 36 days."
951,00:42:19.67,00:42:19.67,You have made itto the final four.
952,00:42:21.27,00:42:21.27,Here's what's left.
953,00:42:22.53,00:42:22.53,"Over the next three days, therewill be three Tribal Councils,"
954,00:42:25.30,00:42:25.30,"two immunity challenges,one winner."
955,00:42:28.57,00:42:28.57,That winner will be determinedby that jury.
956,00:42:33.50,00:42:33.50,You guys can head back to camp.
957,00:42:34.60,00:42:34.60,Good night.
958,00:42:46.13,00:42:46.13,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
959,00:42:52.20,00:42:52.20,PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
960,00:42:54.57,00:42:54.57, Only four remain...
961,00:42:56.57,00:42:56.57,"CLAY: Y'all, there'sonly four torches."
962,00:42:57.90,00:42:57.90,PROBST: ...and it's down to the last three days on the island.
963,00:43:00.67,00:43:00.67,"HELEN: At this level in the game,"
964,00:43:02.20,00:43:02.20," it becomes cutthroat, so the next couple days I expect"
965,00:43:04.30,00:43:04.30,to be extremely stressful.
966,00:43:05.83,00:43:05.83,PROBST: Join us for a two-hour finale
967,00:43:08.07,00:43:08.07, and find out who will be the sole Survivor.
968,00:43:17.37,00:43:17.37,This has beena long and wonderful trip.
969,00:43:21.33,00:43:21.33, I was truly blessed to make it this far.
970,00:43:23.47,00:43:23.47," Sure, I would have loved to have won, but it's okay."
971,00:43:26.67,00:43:26.67, I sucked it all in and I have no regrets.
972,00:43:29.80,00:43:29.80," To my baby Morgan, I did this"
973,00:43:32.87,00:43:32.87,to show you that nothing beatsa failure but a try.
