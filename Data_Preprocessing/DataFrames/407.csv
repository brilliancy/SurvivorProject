189,00:12:03.63,00:12:03.63,Will you remember in the morningthat we made an agreement?
190,00:12:06.37,00:12:06.37,">> We made an agreement, buddy.>> Then in the end it'll be me"
191,00:12:09.07,00:12:09.07,and you.>> That will be a riot.
192,00:12:10.47,00:12:10.47,Let's see if we can do it.>> Rob and I promised each other
193,00:12:29.77,00:12:29.77,not to tell anybody that wediscussed the tribal issues.
194,00:12:33.60,00:12:33.60,We just were going to tell boththe Rotu members and Maraamu
195,00:12:37.33,00:12:37.33,"that the conversation was aboutthe new tribe name, the flag,"
196,00:12:40.73,00:12:40.73,getting to know each other.>> Don't panic.
197,00:12:43.33,00:12:43.33,Don't be nervous.>> We came back to Maraamu.
198,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,">> Hi, guys!>> And we had to inform Paschal"

205,00:13:15.23,00:13:15.23,here.>> We got it. We got it.

207,00:13:20.03,00:13:20.03,">> Let's go.>> Okay, that's it."
208,00:13:31.67,00:13:31.67,Grapefruits coming down.>> One minute!
209,00:13:43.60,00:13:43.60,One minute!(panting)

215,00:14:06.77,00:14:06.77,">> Oh, my God, we did it.>> With only four of us we did"
216,00:14:11.37,00:14:11.37,it.We're a team.
217,00:14:15.73,00:14:15.73,"All of us.No, there's a merge."
218,00:14:18.17,00:14:18.17,">> Oh, really.>> We have so much to talk"
219,00:14:20.90,00:14:20.90,"about.>> Here you go, man."
220,00:14:22.73,00:14:22.73,>> So this is our new buff?(coughing)

223,00:15:28.20,00:15:28.20,">> You know, upon arriving tothe new tribe, it was great to"
224,00:15:32.07,00:15:32.07,"see everyone, but I definitelyentered with hesitancy."
225,00:15:36.57,00:15:36.57,>> You're the only person Ididn't give a hug.
226,00:15:38.60,00:15:38.60,">> I know.Hi, Tam."
227,00:15:39.43,00:15:39.43,"Good, I'm tired.But it's good to see you."
228,00:15:41.33,00:15:41.33,>> You guys also.>> And I was aloof and trying to
229,00:15:44.70,00:15:44.70,figure it all out after hearingwhat Boston Rob told me about
230,00:15:48.27,00:15:48.27,these people wanting to vote meoff.
231,00:15:51.87,00:15:51.87,">> Great seeing you.>> I was disappointed, too, that"
232,00:15:56.10,00:15:56.10,the loyalty's shot.It's gone.
233,00:15:59.77,00:15:59.77,">> So how you doing, Zoe?>> What's that?"
234,00:16:02.00,00:16:02.00,>> How you doing?>> Doing better now that you
235,00:16:04.43,00:16:04.43,"guys are here.Here, I'll put this up in a"
236,00:16:07.53,00:16:07.53,tree.I think we got most of it.
237,00:16:10.23,00:16:10.23,"I was aloof to Zoe, worried thatshe actually was going to vote"
238,00:16:14.73,00:16:14.73,me off.I didn't trust her.
239,00:16:16.23,00:16:16.23,I didn't trust John.I didn't trust Tammy.
240,00:16:18.47,00:16:18.47,I didn't trust the General.I didn't trust anybody when I
241,00:16:21.80,00:16:21.80,"got back here, really.I was very, very, aloof and"
242,00:16:24.77,00:16:24.77,"somewhat quiet, just sort ofhanging on the outer rim."
243,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,>> All right.So these are the new buffs and
244,00:16:31.57,00:16:31.57,"the new flags.>> What's the new name, guys?"
245,00:16:34.37,00:16:34.37,">> Yeah, what's the new name?>> The new name, we had like a"
246,00:16:38.90,00:16:38.90,"half-hour to make this, thismorning, so."
247,00:16:42.00,00:16:42.00,The name of it is Soliantu.>> Soliantu.
248,00:16:49.40,00:16:49.40,>> And the name means...Sacred allegiance to the sun.
249,00:16:55.63,00:16:55.63,">> That's cool, guys.Yeah!"
250,00:16:57.13,00:16:57.13,>> Everybody hold hands.Soliantu!
251,00:17:00.87,00:17:00.87,">> Ready?One, two, three."
252,00:17:03.83,00:17:03.83,Soliantu!>> Let's just get it out of the
253,00:17:07.40,00:17:07.40,way right now.>> Rob and Kathy together
254,00:17:10.23,00:17:10.23,"developed our new name,Soliantu, and our new flag."
255,00:17:13.93,00:17:13.93,"We got our new buffs, pinkbuffs."
256,00:17:16.07,00:17:16.07,The women were very happy aboutit.
257,00:17:18.37,00:17:18.37,"You know, I don't care what theysay."
258,00:17:20.60,00:17:20.60,Real men don't wear pink.>> What was that?
259,00:17:23.27,00:17:23.27,">> I said real men wear pink.>> Okay, Rob."
260,00:17:26.70,00:17:26.70,">> Well, when we finally got theramp and the supplies on shore,"
261,00:17:30.13,00:17:30.13,everybody just like busy littlebeavers went right to doing what
262,00:17:33.57,00:17:33.57,they had to do.>> Reposition.
263,00:17:38.30,00:17:38.30,There we go.>> We were just so happy to be
264,00:17:41.40,00:17:41.40,back together again.It was like old times.
265,00:17:43.67,00:17:43.67,">> So we got a harvest here,Dear Lord, in the name of Jesus,"
266,00:17:46.87,00:17:46.87,"with new tribe members, newcolors and a new life."
267,00:17:49.43,00:17:49.43,"We thank you, Lord, in the nameof Jesus that everyone got here"
268,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,"safely, keep our spirits high,for we know not what's going to"
269,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,"happen tomorrow.We give you all the honor, glory"
270,00:17:59.20,00:17:59.20,"and praise, today andforevermore, for Solianu."
271,00:18:02.37,00:18:02.37,Soliantu?Solianu.
272,00:18:04.80,00:18:04.80,>> Soliantu.>> Soliantu.
273,00:18:06.93,00:18:06.93,"One, two, three, Soliantu.>> The game faces are on in full"
274,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,tilt and nobody wants to talkabout it.
275,00:18:14.80,00:18:14.80,Weird.Nobody wants to talk to me about
276,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,it.I think the game has changed in
277,00:18:25.33,00:18:25.33,the sense that the Rotu loyaltyhas dissolved or it has taken on
278,00:18:30.40,00:18:30.40,new shape.And there is definitely some
279,00:18:34.73,00:18:34.73,undercurrent alliance that'sbeen formed while we were over
280,00:18:40.30,00:18:40.30,at Maraamu.But in my heart I just can't get
281,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,over that this Rotu tribe wantedto vote me off.
282,00:18:59.23,00:18:59.23,>> I'm about ready to get axed.>> Eh.
283,00:19:01.27,00:19:01.27,">> No, I'm serious.I believe it."
284,00:19:04.57,00:19:04.57,"So I don't know what to do.Powerful people on this beach,"
285,00:19:09.10,00:19:09.10,"if you ask me.They're playing us, just so you"
286,00:19:12.17,00:19:12.17,know.They're playing you and Neleh
287,00:19:14.20,00:19:14.20,"too, and I just want you tounderstand that."
288,00:19:16.63,00:19:16.63,">> Oh, I understand thatcompletely."
289,00:19:18.03,00:19:18.03,>> Yeah.I think it's time to find out
290,00:19:19.53,00:19:19.53,how we all are playing out inthese people's minds.
291,00:19:23.07,00:19:23.07,Not just sit and wait to getvoted off.
292,00:19:28.63,00:19:28.63,">> Well, when we first landed,Kathy, I think she may have been"
293,00:19:32.70,00:19:32.70,advised by Rob either on the wayover here or sometime shortly
294,00:19:37.50,00:19:37.50,"after we got here, that she wasbeing looked at very closely as"
295,00:19:40.90,00:19:40.90,"a possible first elimination,and she was really upset about"
296,00:19:44.27,00:19:44.27,"it.I just told Kathy, I said look,"
297,00:19:46.30,00:19:46.30,"you know, I'll listen and maybethere's an opportunity that"
298,00:19:49.57,00:19:49.57,"we'll find ourselves in, and ifI do, I'll let you know."
299,00:19:52.73,00:19:52.73,I just didn't want her to get ina confrontational mode this
300,00:19:56.13,00:19:56.13,"early on after reuniting.>> By God, it's a game."
301,00:19:59.10,00:19:59.10,But I don't think lying fitsinto games.
302,00:20:01.63,00:20:01.63,"So just tell me the truth, man,and keep it upfront because"
303,00:20:05.57,00:20:05.57,I just can't deal with lying.And integrity is critical in
304,00:20:09.60,00:20:09.60,"this game, I feel.So I really appreciate it."
305,00:20:21.13,00:20:21.13,>> Those little white ballthings-- I don't know what those
306,00:20:24.33,00:20:24.33,are called.>> A couple people said that you
307,00:20:27.47,00:20:27.47,absolutely should not lie toplay this game.
308,00:20:30.83,00:20:30.83,"Let's, you know, start somethingnew."
309,00:20:32.53,00:20:32.53,Let's tell everybody beforethey're going to get voted out
310,00:20:35.30,00:20:35.30,"and let's not lie, ever.And you know what, that is just"
311,00:20:39.63,00:20:39.63,"great, up here.But it's not realistic."
312,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,>> I don't want any bugscrawling in my ears.
313,00:20:44.90,00:20:44.90,Same here.>> This is a game about being
314,00:20:48.87,00:20:48.87,"the smartest person, outwitting,outplaying and outlasting"
315,00:20:52.40,00:20:52.40,"everybody else, and you may haveto tell a white lie along the"
316,00:20:56.13,00:20:56.13,way or two or three.But I went into this game
317,00:20:59.23,00:20:59.23,knowing that I was going to dowhat it takes to win the game.
318,00:21:03.77,00:21:03.77,I hope when all is said and donethat these people still look at
319,00:21:06.83,00:21:06.83,me and still like me.I don't intend to lie to any of
320,00:21:09.40,00:21:09.40,"their faces, but I do intend toplay the game and win it."
321,00:21:26.23,00:21:26.23,>> What's up?Should we have a little talk?
322,00:21:30.97,00:21:30.97,>> Sure.>> I wanted to talk to you two
323,00:21:32.63,00:21:32.63,privately.Sure.
324,00:21:33.53,00:21:33.53,>> Branch down here to sit on.>> I want to talk about a couple
325,00:21:39.70,00:21:39.70,things.>> Oh...
326,00:21:42.50,00:21:42.50,>> I'm just curious.Who you guys voting for?
327,00:21:44.63,00:21:44.63,>> I haven't figured my vote.>> I don't think it's any of
328,00:21:47.07,00:21:47.07,"your business, first of all.>> I find you amazing, Zoe."
329,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,>> Excuse me?>> I find you amazing.
330,00:21:50.83,00:21:50.83,">> Why thank you.>> I trust you, and everybody is"
331,00:21:54.13,00:21:54.13,"lying, left and right.>> You know what it is, it's all"
332,00:21:57.40,00:21:57.40,"about tribal loyalty.There's still a ghost of Rotu,"
333,00:21:59.70,00:21:59.70,"and that's what the problem is.>> Right, but that wasn't the"
334,00:22:02.47,00:22:02.47,"way it was supposed to be, wasit, Zoe?"
335,00:22:04.20,00:22:04.20,"I mean, I thought we had anagreement, Zoe, you know?"
336,00:22:06.60,00:22:06.60,"You and I and John and Tammy andSean, and Vecepia and Rob."
337,00:22:11.80,00:22:11.80,>> Agreement about?>> Didn't we have an agreement
338,00:22:14.13,00:22:14.13,about taking everybody fromtheir side of the island off?
339,00:22:16.83,00:22:16.83,You don't remember anythingabout that?
340,00:22:19.07,00:22:19.07,">> No.>> See, this is what I mean."
341,00:22:21.10,00:22:21.10,Unbelievable.And Kathy wasn't your first
342,00:22:23.30,00:22:23.30,"choice as soon as she got here,and we promised that if we got"
343,00:22:26.37,00:22:26.37,rid of Gabe that we'd staytogether?
344,00:22:28.07,00:22:28.07,>> How did you ever get that?>> How do I ever get that?
345,00:22:31.40,00:22:31.40,"Unbelievable.Tell the truth, go on, will you?"
346,00:22:34.20,00:22:34.20,"Tell the truth.Don't worry, everybody."
347,00:22:36.70,00:22:36.70,"I'm telling everybody tonight,Zoe, everybody."
348,00:22:39.80,00:22:39.80,"The other day, didn't you tellme you were voting for Kathy,"
349,00:22:42.53,00:22:42.53,"yes or no?>> No, I didn't."
350,00:22:47.83,00:22:47.83,">> No, you didn't?You paused and you lied."
351,00:22:50.77,00:22:50.77,I can't say that I didn't see itcoming.
352,00:22:52.93,00:22:52.93,"It was like a certain degree oftrust that I felt, among the"
353,00:22:56.20,00:22:56.20,group.And it completely got shattered.
354,00:23:00.23,00:23:00.23,"Where you going?You leaving, Kathy?"
355,00:23:02.60,00:23:02.60,">> Yeah, for crying out loud, Iget a story from you and then I"
356,00:23:05.53,00:23:05.53,"get a story from Zoe and peopleare lying through their teeth,"
357,00:23:08.43,00:23:08.43,"and I haven't lied once, man.I don't know what this stupid"
358,00:23:12.80,00:23:12.80,"game is about, but I'm out ofhere."
359,00:23:13.93,00:23:13.93,">> You can believe what you wantto believe, okay."
360,00:23:16.77,00:23:16.77,">> I don't like to be lied to,and then again and again and"
361,00:23:20.17,00:23:20.17,again.It irritates me.
362,00:23:44.87,00:23:44.87,>> Zoe is lying to me.They're all lying to me.
363,00:23:48.10,00:23:48.10,"They're all lying to me,and I'm being played as a pawn."
364,00:23:51.90,00:23:51.90,A pawn.I need the immunity because I'm
365,00:23:59.30,00:23:59.30,getting the ax.I don't know.
366,00:24:01.20,00:24:01.20,"It's just not adding up, but I'mgoing to trust what Rob told me,"
367,00:24:04.77,00:24:04.77,and I need immunity to stay inthe game.
368,00:24:22.03,00:24:22.03,">> PROBST: First things first.As always, Edgar is coming back."
369,00:24:27.40,00:24:27.40,"Let me say, congratulations onmaking the merge."
370,00:24:30.07,00:24:30.07,The good news is you now have aone in ten shot of being the
371,00:24:33.00,00:24:33.00,sole survivor.Now because we are an individual

497,00:33:00.63,00:33:00.63,worse than Rob.I probably wanted to push John
498,00:33:03.13,00:33:03.13,into that freaking fire.The reason I'm more upset
499,00:33:05.57,00:33:05.57,because I've had personalone-on-ones with John and we've
500,00:33:08.40,00:33:08.40,"self-disclosed stuff.How it's like to be a black man,"
501,00:33:10.77,00:33:10.77,"how it's like to be a gay man,what it's like to be isolated."
502,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,We shared moments that gotnothing to do with this game.
503,00:33:15.87,00:33:15.87,"And when we share those kind ofmoments, and then you come and"
504,00:33:19.03,00:33:19.03,"try to pull some BS like this,it's really hurtful."

523,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,I think it is a differentmindset because you're coming

525,00:34:49.40,00:34:49.40,So you're no longer looking atthe other person as your

558,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,">> PROBST: How about you, Rob?Are you happy with the way you"
559,00:36:37.43,00:36:37.43,played?>> I'm happy with the way I've
560,00:36:38.83,00:36:38.83,play the game.>> PROBST: Have you lied?
561,00:36:40.73,00:36:40.73,>> Yes.>> PROBST: Anybody else here
562,00:36:43.27,00:36:43.27,lied to you?>> Without a doubt people have
563,00:36:45.80,00:36:45.80,lied to me.People that are sitting here
564,00:36:47.93,00:36:47.93,"telling you right now that theyhave not lied, they have lied."
565,00:36:51.27,00:36:51.27,Those people know who they are.I don't feel it's necessary to
566,00:36:55.37,00:36:55.37,"one by one single them out, butI think people need to be able"
567,00:36:59.23,00:36:59.23,to look in the mirror atthemselves after and if they're
568,00:37:02.47,00:37:02.47,"happy with the way they playedthe game, that's fair enough for"
569,00:37:06.03,00:37:06.03,me.>> PROBST: All right.
570,00:37:07.37,00:37:07.37,"There's a new facet now toimmunity, now that we've reached"
571,00:37:10.53,00:37:10.53,"the individual stage, and itworks like this."
572,00:37:12.93,00:37:12.93,"When you win immunity, you nowown immunity, and you can assign"
573,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,"that immunity to somebody else.So if you feel very secure, you"
574,00:37:22.13,00:37:22.13,"can buy a favor, you can buysomebody's vote, you can protect"
575,00:37:26.43,00:37:26.43,somebody if you want simply bygiving your immunity to them.
576,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,"Kathy, you didn't have theluxury of negotiating today."
577,00:37:34.10,00:37:34.10,So I'll put you on the spot now.And are you secure enough now to
578,00:37:38.37,00:37:38.37,give that immunity to somebodyelse?
579,00:37:40.73,00:37:40.73,>> After what I went throughtoday?
580,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,I do not feel secure.Because I feel that there were
581,00:37:45.93,00:37:45.93,some really strange things thathappened today with deceit and
582,00:37:49.60,00:37:49.60,lies that I'll talk to peopleabout it and hopefully get it
583,00:37:53.07,00:37:53.07,"resolved, but I question thewhole loyalty thing."
584,00:37:55.97,00:37:55.97,It evaporated.So the immunity to me right now
585,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,is important.>> PROBST: It's time to vote.
586,00:38:03.03,00:38:03.03,Kathy is the only one safe fromthe vote.
587,00:38:05.27,00:38:05.27,"Neleh, you're first.>> Boston Rob, I'm voting for"
588,00:38:28.30,00:38:28.30,"you, boy.You tried to stir up a lot of"
589,00:38:30.67,00:38:30.67,stuff today.I knew from the beginning that
590,00:38:32.93,00:38:32.93,you weren't going to keep yourword.
591,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"You attacked me personally, soI'm more than happy to put this"
592,00:38:37.73,00:38:37.73,in here for you.>> I vote for Johnny.
593,00:38:51.83,00:38:51.83,"You play the game real well.Hopefully, if things swing"
594,00:38:55.33,00:38:55.33,"right, you'll be gone.If not we'll see you on the flip"
595,00:38:58.53,00:38:58.53,"side.>> Yo, look here, man."
596,00:39:09.03,00:39:09.03,"I'm voting for you because youdissed me and my boy, and if I"
597,00:39:11.87,00:39:11.87,"get voted out next, I reallydon't give a damn."
598,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,But your time is coming.You definitely lied to us.
599,00:39:18.00,00:39:18.00,"That's for me and you, dawg.>> My vote tonight is for Rob"
600,00:39:40.57,00:39:40.57,"Mariano.Brother, you know, we came into"
601,00:39:43.13,00:39:43.13,"this tribe with not the rightnumbers, so we were kind of"
602,00:39:46.70,00:39:46.70,down.But I know soon I'll have to set
603,00:39:50.17,00:39:50.17,up that debt for the Maraamutribe and give you guys all
604,00:39:54.20,00:39:54.20,pizza and beer.I'm looking forward to it.
605,00:39:56.70,00:39:56.70,See you soon.>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
606,00:40:04.03,00:40:04.03,"votes.Once the votes are read,"
607,00:40:19.00,00:40:19.00,the decision is final.The person will be asked to
608,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.

614,00:41:13.57,00:41:13.57,Rob.That's five.
615,00:41:19.57,00:41:19.57,Seventh person voted out of thetribe: Boston Rob.
616,00:41:23.43,00:41:23.43,"No need to read the last vote.Rob, the tribe has spoken."
617,00:41:35.27,00:41:35.27,">> Good luck, guys.>> PROBST: Well, you've made it"

619,00:41:54.93,00:41:54.93,which means the fate of two ofyou rests in the hands of the

621,00:42:01.73,00:42:01.73,should make for a veryinteresting final 18 days.

623,00:42:19.17,00:42:19.17,Stay tuned for scenesfrom our next episode.

627,00:42:31.33,00:42:31.33,>> Zoe just lied to mepoint-blank.

632,00:42:41.67,00:42:41.67,I'm following my heart.There's got to be something
633,00:42:43.77,00:42:43.77,changed here.>> I like people to know that
634,00:42:51.43,00:42:51.43,"this was a game, and I hopeeverybody doesn't take so much"
635,00:42:54.70,00:42:54.70,of everything that I saidseriously.
636,00:42:56.67,00:42:56.67,I was trying to be funny.It's just my personality.
637,00:42:59.23,00:42:59.23,I definitely enjoyed the game.I like trying to manipulate more
638,00:43:02.50,00:43:02.50,than anything else.I hope nobody comes away with
639,00:43:04.97,00:43:04.97,any bad feelings afterwards.I hope we can all be friends.
