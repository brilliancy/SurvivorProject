2,00:00:02.53,00:00:02.53,Survivor: John made an alliance with the other three original
3,00:00:05.63,00:00:05.63,Rotu members and took control of the tribe.
4,00:00:07.80,00:00:07.80,>> Everyone knows I'm the leader.
5,00:00:09.20,00:00:09.20,Everyone knows it's my plan. >> PROBST: But Rob and Sean were
6,00:00:11.87,00:00:11.87,left out of the alliance and have their own plans for John.
7,00:00:14.43,00:00:14.43,">> If I have any opportunity at all to get rid of John, I will."
8,00:00:17.43,00:00:17.43,>> PROBST: Rob and John decided to make a pitch and join John's
9,00:00:20.50,00:00:20.50,"alliance. >> I'm giving you my word, 100%."
10,00:00:22.43,00:00:22.43,>> PROBST: They cut a deal. In case of a merge they'll vote
11,00:00:25.07,00:00:25.07,together to eliminate Maraamu first.
12,00:00:26.70,00:00:26.70,">> I want them to trust me, but he shouldn't."
13,00:00:29.30,00:00:29.30,>> PROBST: Go! Rob then led Rotu to victory in
14,00:00:32.00,00:00:32.00,"the immunity challenge, >> Rotu wins!"
15,00:00:34.20,00:00:34.20,">> PROBST ...sending Maraamu to Tribal Council, where they voted"
16,00:00:38.00,00:00:38.00,Gina out of the tribe. The tribe has spoken.
17,00:00:42.43,00:00:42.43,Ten survivors remain. Who will be voted out tonight?
18,00:02:07.07,00:02:07.07,">> It's a skull of a man! >> Oh, that's definitely a"
19,00:02:11.43,00:02:11.43,skull. >> What is that?
20,00:02:13.73,00:02:13.73,Is that the eyeball socket? >> Yeah.
21,00:02:15.23,00:02:15.23,That's the eye socket. >> Oh!
22,00:02:17.90,00:02:17.90,>> This is unbelievable. >> It really is.
23,00:02:19.70,00:02:19.70,>> It's hard to believe how many centuries we're looking at right
24,00:02:22.47,00:02:22.47,"here. >> Look, that's his ribcage."
25,00:02:24.47,00:02:24.47,Do we agree that's a paepae? >> It is a paepae because these
26,00:02:28.23,00:02:28.23,rocks are too evenly formed. A paepae is a Marquesan
27,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,monument. That's where they had their
28,00:02:33.73,00:02:33.73,ceremonies and where they even performed cannibalism.
29,00:02:36.50,00:02:36.50,>> They just buried them in the side of a wall?
30,00:02:38.83,00:02:38.83,>> Look at how this skull is fractured.
31,00:02:40.70,00:02:40.70,">> Yeah, that's what I was talking about."
32,00:02:42.70,00:02:42.70,>> It's obvious it had some blunt trauma to the head.
33,00:02:45.57,00:02:45.57,A fracture all the way across here.
34,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70,>> I think it was an emotional day.
35,00:02:54.97,00:02:54.97,"Last night, it was tough. Tough vote."
36,00:02:57.27,00:02:57.27,"I was happy at one point that the vote went my way, but when I"
37,00:03:00.80,00:03:00.80,"saw Gina leave, I felt really bad."
38,00:03:02.67,00:03:02.67,">> Go over here, back under... >> Paschal and Neleh, I don't"
39,00:03:06.73,00:03:06.73,think I can break up that situation.
40,00:03:08.53,00:03:08.53,They have a really great bond. Because we're at three right
41,00:03:11.43,00:03:11.43,"now, I have to work it. It'll be tough."
42,00:03:13.30,00:03:13.30,"I think if we do get to another vote, they'll vote me off."
43,00:03:30.97,00:03:30.97,>> You're thinking of catching a piglet.
44,00:03:33.03,00:03:33.03,I'm thinking of catching a pig. I mean there are a bunch of pigs
45,00:03:36.43,00:03:36.43,running around. There's one right there.
46,00:03:40.53,00:03:40.53,>> This tribe is a bunch of morons.
47,00:03:45.87,00:03:45.87,I've just about had it with this tribe.
48,00:03:47.73,00:03:47.73,>> Hello. >> How are you?
49,00:03:49.53,00:03:49.53,Good morning. >> Doing great.
50,00:03:51.63,00:03:51.63,>> Vecepia is just so fake to me.
51,00:03:54.13,00:03:54.13,"The way people are acting, it drives me crazy."
52,00:03:56.77,00:03:56.77,Maybe that's their game. Everybody is going to be happy
53,00:04:00.17,00:04:00.17,"to each other, but I hate it. I think at the other camp I"
54,00:04:05.10,00:04:05.10,"always had an ace in the hole, and over here I don't."
55,00:04:08.10,00:04:08.10,>> The only thing is we don't know if they're keeping their
56,00:04:10.73,00:04:10.73,"word. Say, like, they get rid of Kathy"
57,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,"like they said the first time, but then say just as a"
58,00:04:15.87,00:04:15.87,precaution they might get rid of one of us.
59,00:04:18.13,00:04:18.13,Just so we can't do an alliance. I've been stuck in a roadblock
60,00:04:22.20,00:04:22.20,"situation for the past ten days, and I haven't been able to get"
61,00:04:25.63,00:04:25.63,around it. And it's like I've tried going
62,00:04:27.83,00:04:27.83,up one side of the mountain and I've tried going up the other
63,00:04:31.13,00:04:31.13,"side, and maybe it's time to try to just dig a hole right through"
64,00:04:34.67,00:04:34.67,it. >> Mail call.
65,00:04:43.13,00:04:43.13,"Okay, ladies! >> No, you."
66,00:04:45.57,00:04:45.57,">> Yeah, go right ahead. Oh, it's a long one."
67,00:04:51.03,00:04:51.03,">> It's a long one. ""You'll be left in stitches if"
68,00:04:53.63,00:04:53.63,you sew up this reward. Give this map to one survivor.
69,00:04:57.13,00:04:57.13,Defeat can you not afford. Choose your one wisely with
70,00:05:00.90,00:05:00.90,long sleeves and long pants. Don't send the wrong tribe
71,00:05:04.20,00:05:04.20,"mate. This may be your last chance."""
72,00:05:06.27,00:05:06.27,One of us has to leave. >> There's a map here.
73,00:05:10.90,00:05:10.90,"We've got five minutes to pick one person, get them outfitted"
74,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63,"in long-sleeved pants, tennis shoes, and have them start"
75,00:05:17.13,00:05:17.13,"following this map. Okay, who do we want to send?"
76,00:05:27.37,00:05:27.37,>> I'll volunteer. I'll go do it.
77,00:05:33.27,00:05:33.27,>> Is there anybody else that wants to go do this one?
78,00:05:35.37,00:05:35.37,">> Okay, that's fine. >> I've got five minutes?"
79,00:05:39.10,00:05:39.10,>> Less than that now. Put on long pants.
80,00:05:42.37,00:05:42.37,">> I'm going to do it for us. Rotu, come on."
81,00:05:44.40,00:05:44.40,">> All right, man, Rotu, Rotu. >> I got my pack."
82,00:05:47.80,00:05:47.80,I'll take some mango. Thank you.
83,00:05:54.50,00:05:54.50,Give me the map. >> Be careful!
84,00:05:56.57,00:05:56.57,>> I will. >> Where's the knife?
85,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,Give me a knife. >> You going to want socks also?
86,00:06:00.73,00:06:00.73,">> Might as well, right? >> We're all counting on you,"
87,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,babe. Put some coconut in your pocket.
88,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,"Come on, boy. >> Now it's in God's hands."
89,00:06:11.57,00:06:11.57,">> Yeah, I volunteered because I thought there may be a change"
90,00:06:15.30,00:06:15.30,and something might be getting shaken up.
91,00:06:18.00,00:06:18.00,But that's how I've been playing this game.
92,00:06:19.73,00:06:19.73,"I've been taking chances. >> PROBST: Hey, guys."
93,00:06:45.20,00:06:45.20,"Hey. >> PROBST: How you doing, man?"
94,00:06:47.13,00:06:47.13,"Kathy, how are you? >> Good to see you."
95,00:06:49.53,00:06:49.53,>> PROBST: Welcome to Kamuihei. This area in particular is
96,00:06:52.73,00:06:52.73,"called a tohua, which is a public meeting place, so"
97,00:06:55.60,00:06:55.60,anything important that would happen in tribal life would
98,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,happen right here. You will now serve as
99,00:07:00.87,00:07:00.87,"ambassadors to a very important event in your world, the merging"
100,00:07:04.50,00:07:04.50,"of your two tribes. Rotu, Maraamu, no more."
101,00:07:08.40,00:07:08.40,"Tonight, the new tribe will be born under your guidance."
102,00:07:11.43,00:07:11.43,You will sleep under the stars on the same paepae where rival
103,00:07:16.33,00:07:16.33,chiefs would meet 500 years ago to discuss and make decisions.
104,00:07:21.27,00:07:21.27,"By morning, you will have made several important decisions,"
105,00:07:24.87,00:07:24.87,"among them creating the new tribes' name, and painting the"
106,00:07:27.87,00:07:27.87,new tribal flag. Now because this is a very big
107,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,"responsibility, we want you guys to be well fed, so you're"
108,00:07:33.47,00:07:33.47,"thinking very clearly. So if you guys will have a seat,"
109,00:07:36.43,00:07:36.43,I will go get your food. >> We got a lot to talk about.
110,00:07:40.47,00:07:40.47,">> Yeah, man. >> PROBST: Tell me this is not"
111,00:07:43.47,00:07:43.47,"going to be a fun night. >> Oh, my God, yes!"
112,00:07:46.10,00:07:46.10,>> PROBST: A little more to come.
113,00:07:47.87,00:07:47.87,>> Thank you! >> PROBST: Now what would pizza
114,00:07:50.97,00:07:50.97,be without beer! >> All right!
115,00:07:55.03,00:07:55.03,">> Oh, my God. Jeff sat us down to pizza and"
116,00:07:59.43,00:07:59.43,30 Coors Light. >> Cheers.
117,00:08:03.97,00:08:03.97,>> Cheers. >> I was siting across from this
118,00:08:09.03,00:08:09.03,"young buck, and I'm going, ""I'm going to pound beers and"
119,00:08:12.90,00:08:12.90,"eat pizza with this guy?"" I've heard a lot about you."
120,00:08:23.57,00:08:23.57,>> I've heard a lot about you. (laughing)
121,00:08:31.03,00:08:31.03,>> So we have to come up with a name.
122,00:08:32.97,00:08:32.97,>> Bernie's tribe. >> That's original.
123,00:08:36.87,00:08:36.87,>> I was just on a total high. I knew that by responding to
124,00:08:40.47,00:08:40.47,"this challenge I was taking a chance, and it paid off."
125,00:08:44.80,00:08:44.80,Pizza and beer! >> I feel so bad.
126,00:08:47.13,00:08:47.13,My tribe people would love pizza.
127,00:08:49.50,00:08:49.50,">> I feel bad, too. >> You do not."
128,00:08:53.80,00:08:53.80,>> That's too bad for them. >> We started talking
129,00:09:00.63,00:09:00.63,immediately about what's happening with the tribes.
130,00:09:04.23,00:09:04.23,"Zoe and I were like the moms. You know, we were cleaning up."
131,00:09:06.67,00:09:06.67,We were getting the tribe going. >> Really.
132,00:09:08.43,00:09:08.43,">> Oh, yeah. >> You and Zoe feel you're"
133,00:09:10.03,00:09:10.03,pretty close? >> Zoe and I were like moms.
134,00:09:11.73,00:09:11.73,"""Let's clean the place up."" >> Unreal."
135,00:09:13.37,00:09:13.37,That's unreal. The lies going on.
136,00:09:15.27,00:09:15.27,"Honestly, you feel you're close, you and Zoe?"
137,00:09:17.80,00:09:17.80,>> Zoe? >> Yeah.
138,00:09:19.13,00:09:19.13,Unreal. Zoe is funny because I
139,00:09:21.70,00:09:21.70,confronted Zoe. She told me that she was voting
140,00:09:24.67,00:09:24.67,"you off, right, and then I go to John, I said, ""John, who's"
141,00:09:28.87,00:09:28.87,"next?,"" and he said, ""Kathy."" She doesn't know if I'm telling"
142,00:09:32.83,00:09:32.83,"the truth or lying, just like I don't know, just like nobody in"
143,00:09:36.53,00:09:36.53,this game knows who's telling the truth.
144,00:09:40.30,00:09:40.30,">> After talking to Gina, I thought he was just a lazy kid."
145,00:09:43.20,00:09:43.20,"Young, didn't care. I'm having a hard time with it."
146,00:09:47.30,00:09:47.30,>> What exactly did Gina say about me that made me out to be
147,00:09:49.97,00:09:49.97,such a bad person that they want to vote me off so bad now?
148,00:09:52.63,00:09:52.63,>> You're a lazy bum and you don't care about anything.
149,00:09:55.57,00:09:55.57,>> Really? >> She thinks you were two-faced
150,00:09:58.33,00:09:58.33,and you were mean. >> Really.
151,00:10:00.27,00:10:00.27,That's unreal. >> You're telling me Zoe is
152,00:10:02.47,00:10:02.47,"voting me off. Zoe and I bonded, so you think"
153,00:10:04.50,00:10:04.50,that's not a shock to my system? >> Let me tell you something.
154,00:10:07.43,00:10:07.43,"I'm sitting here talking to you right now, Kathy."
155,00:10:09.93,00:10:09.93,I may be writing my own destiny up here.
156,00:10:13.77,00:10:13.77,"If they find out that I said anything, then they're going to"
157,00:10:17.57,00:10:17.57,take me out and you'll be second.
158,00:10:19.67,00:10:19.67,Unless we're going to change that.
159,00:10:21.77,00:10:21.77,"You want to make a pact, me and you?"
160,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,>> Do you want to? >> They'll never know.
161,00:10:26.70,00:10:26.70,It will be just me and you. >> I felt this pact we were
162,00:10:30.27,00:10:30.27,"going to form was okay, but it happened so quickly, and he"
163,00:10:34.00,00:10:34.00,"wanted it so badly, I just sort of shook hands."
164,00:10:36.63,00:10:36.63,All right. >> All right.
165,00:10:39.43,00:10:39.43,>> Let's do it. >> Serious.
166,00:10:40.70,00:10:40.70,">> All right, I am really serious."
167,00:10:42.30,00:10:42.30,Don't stab me. >> You don't have to ask me
168,00:10:44.03,00:10:44.03,"twice. I swear to God, I will never"
169,00:10:45.33,00:10:45.33,vote you off. I promise.
170,00:10:46.40,00:10:46.40,John thinks I have an alliance with the team.
171,00:10:48.90,00:10:48.90,Now she thinks I have an alliance with her.
172,00:10:50.80,00:10:50.80,"Dude, I've been lying this whole game."
173,00:11:03.57,00:11:03.57,John thinks he's going to ride it all the way to the end.
174,00:11:06.83,00:11:06.83,"I'm being serious. >> No, I'm totally agreeing with"
175,00:11:09.53,00:11:09.53,you. I just can't get over how
176,00:11:11.03,00:11:11.03,"conniving it is. >> Who is John, some kind of"
177,00:11:13.73,00:11:13.73,Marquesan god? (laughing)
178,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,Have another beer. >> I'm a little hesitant on why
179,00:11:21.70,00:11:21.70,he just suddenly decided to make me on as his soulmate or
180,00:11:25.87,00:11:25.87,whatever it is. It was so quick.
181,00:11:28.53,00:11:28.53,And I just don't trust that element of it.
182,00:11:31.00,00:11:31.00,"We're going to sleep well, under mosquito netting, my God."
183,00:11:34.47,00:11:34.47,Does that mean that we can sleep without pants on?
184,00:11:37.60,00:11:37.60,Don't panic. >> You're crazy.
185,00:11:41.03,00:11:41.03,We can't talk about anything that's going on.
186,00:11:44.63,00:11:44.63,I basically saw another Sarah in her for me.
187,00:11:47.83,00:11:47.83,"Warm me up, baby. Want to massage me, baby?"
188,00:11:55.47,00:11:55.47,It's going to be interesting because if I actually do stand
189,00:12:00.07,00:12:00.07,"by my word and go with Kathy, it's a new game."
190,00:12:03.63,00:12:03.63,Will you remember in the morning that we made an agreement?
191,00:12:06.37,00:12:06.37,">> We made an agreement, buddy. >> Then in the end it'll be me"
192,00:12:09.07,00:12:09.07,and you. >> That will be a riot.
193,00:12:10.47,00:12:10.47,Let's see if we can do it. >> Rob and I promised each other
194,00:12:29.77,00:12:29.77,not to tell anybody that we discussed the tribal issues.
195,00:12:33.60,00:12:33.60,We just were going to tell both the Rotu members and Maraamu
196,00:12:37.33,00:12:37.33,"that the conversation was about the new tribe name, the flag,"
197,00:12:40.73,00:12:40.73,getting to know each other. >> Don't panic.
198,00:12:43.33,00:12:43.33,Don't be nervous. >> We came back to Maraamu.
199,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,">> Hi, guys! >> And we had to inform Paschal"
200,00:12:49.53,00:12:49.53,and Neleh that we had to get everything out of the camp onto
201,00:12:53.70,00:12:53.70,a raft in five minutes. We got five minutes!
202,00:12:56.63,00:12:56.63,"Everything we got, come on. Everything we got."
203,00:12:59.63,00:12:59.63,Everything! Get the kettles.
204,00:13:04.07,00:13:04.07,"Get the knives, Neleh! >> Put everything on top."
205,00:13:12.20,00:13:12.20,"Water jugs, Pappy. Kathy, help me get it on top"
206,00:13:15.23,00:13:15.23,here. >> We got it. We got it.
207,00:13:17.33,00:13:17.33,Keep going. Keep going.
208,00:13:20.03,00:13:20.03,">> Let's go. >> Okay, that's it."
209,00:13:31.67,00:13:31.67,Grapefruits coming down. >> One minute!
210,00:13:43.60,00:13:43.60,One minute! (panting)
211,00:13:51.07,00:13:51.07,"Everybody back to the raft. Now, Paschal!"
212,00:13:56.80,00:13:56.80,"Touch the raft. Good job, guys."
213,00:14:01.60,00:14:01.60,">> Good job, buddy. Nice to meet you."
214,00:14:04.00,00:14:04.00,">> Yeah, you too, buddy. Rob."
215,00:14:05.87,00:14:05.87,Pascal. Neleh.
216,00:14:06.77,00:14:06.77,">> Oh, my God, we did it. >> With only four of us we did"
217,00:14:11.37,00:14:11.37,it. We're a team.
218,00:14:15.73,00:14:15.73,"All of us. No, there's a merge."
219,00:14:18.17,00:14:18.17,">> Oh, really. >> We have so much to talk"
220,00:14:20.90,00:14:20.90,"about. >> Here you go, man."
221,00:14:22.73,00:14:22.73,>> So this is our new buff? (coughing)
222,00:14:26.77,00:14:26.77,>> This is it. (cheers)
223,00:14:33.63,00:14:33.63,">> Good job, guys. Unbelievable."
224,00:15:28.20,00:15:28.20,">> You know, upon arriving to the new tribe, it was great to"
225,00:15:32.07,00:15:32.07,"see everyone, but I definitely entered with hesitancy."
226,00:15:36.57,00:15:36.57,>> You're the only person I didn't give a hug.
227,00:15:38.60,00:15:38.60,">> I know. Hi, Tam."
228,00:15:39.43,00:15:39.43,"Good, I'm tired. But it's good to see you."
229,00:15:41.33,00:15:41.33,>> You guys also. >> And I was aloof and trying to
230,00:15:44.70,00:15:44.70,figure it all out after hearing what Boston Rob told me about
231,00:15:48.27,00:15:48.27,these people wanting to vote me off.
232,00:15:51.87,00:15:51.87,">> Great seeing you. >> I was disappointed, too, that"
233,00:15:56.10,00:15:56.10,the loyalty's shot. It's gone.
234,00:15:59.77,00:15:59.77,">> So how you doing, Zoe? >> What's that?"
235,00:16:02.00,00:16:02.00,>> How you doing? >> Doing better now that you
236,00:16:04.43,00:16:04.43,"guys are here. Here, I'll put this up in a"
237,00:16:07.53,00:16:07.53,tree. I think we got most of it.
238,00:16:10.23,00:16:10.23,"I was aloof to Zoe, worried that she actually was going to vote"
239,00:16:14.73,00:16:14.73,me off. I didn't trust her.
240,00:16:16.23,00:16:16.23,I didn't trust John. I didn't trust Tammy.
241,00:16:18.47,00:16:18.47,I didn't trust the General. I didn't trust anybody when I
242,00:16:21.80,00:16:21.80,"got back here, really. I was very, very, aloof and"
243,00:16:24.77,00:16:24.77,"somewhat quiet, just sort of hanging on the outer rim."
244,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,>> All right. So these are the new buffs and
245,00:16:31.57,00:16:31.57,"the new flags. >> What's the new name, guys?"
246,00:16:34.37,00:16:34.37,">> Yeah, what's the new name? >> The new name, we had like a"
247,00:16:38.90,00:16:38.90,"half-hour to make this, this morning, so."
248,00:16:42.00,00:16:42.00,The name of it is Soliantu. >> Soliantu.
249,00:16:49.40,00:16:49.40,>> And the name means... Sacred allegiance to the sun.
250,00:16:55.63,00:16:55.63,">> That's cool, guys. Yeah!"
251,00:16:57.13,00:16:57.13,>> Everybody hold hands. Soliantu!
252,00:17:00.87,00:17:00.87,">> Ready? One, two, three."
253,00:17:03.83,00:17:03.83,Soliantu! >> Let's just get it out of the
254,00:17:07.40,00:17:07.40,way right now. >> Rob and Kathy together
255,00:17:10.23,00:17:10.23,"developed our new name, Soliantu, and our new flag."
256,00:17:13.93,00:17:13.93,"We got our new buffs, pink buffs."
257,00:17:16.07,00:17:16.07,The women were very happy about it.
258,00:17:18.37,00:17:18.37,"You know, I don't care what they say."
259,00:17:20.60,00:17:20.60,Real men don't wear pink. >> What was that?
260,00:17:23.27,00:17:23.27,">> I said real men wear pink. >> Okay, Rob."
261,00:17:26.70,00:17:26.70,">> Well, when we finally got the ramp and the supplies on shore,"
262,00:17:30.13,00:17:30.13,everybody just like busy little beavers went right to doing what
263,00:17:33.57,00:17:33.57,they had to do. >> Reposition.
264,00:17:38.30,00:17:38.30,There we go. >> We were just so happy to be
265,00:17:41.40,00:17:41.40,back together again. It was like old times.
266,00:17:43.67,00:17:43.67,">> So we got a harvest here, Dear Lord, in the name of Jesus,"
267,00:17:46.87,00:17:46.87,"with new tribe members, new colors and a new life."
268,00:17:49.43,00:17:49.43,"We thank you, Lord, in the name of Jesus that everyone got here"
269,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,"safely, keep our spirits high, for we know not what's going to"
270,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,"happen tomorrow. We give you all the honor, glory"
271,00:17:59.20,00:17:59.20,"and praise, today and forevermore, for Solianu."
272,00:18:02.37,00:18:02.37,Soliantu? Solianu.
273,00:18:04.80,00:18:04.80,>> Soliantu. >> Soliantu.
274,00:18:06.93,00:18:06.93,"One, two, three, Soliantu. >> The game faces are on in full"
275,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,tilt and nobody wants to talk about it.
276,00:18:14.80,00:18:14.80,Weird. Nobody wants to talk to me about
277,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,it. I think the game has changed in
278,00:18:25.33,00:18:25.33,the sense that the Rotu loyalty has dissolved or it has taken on
279,00:18:30.40,00:18:30.40,new shape. And there is definitely some
280,00:18:34.73,00:18:34.73,undercurrent alliance that's been formed while we were over
281,00:18:40.30,00:18:40.30,at Maraamu. But in my heart I just can't get
282,00:18:43.27,00:18:43.27,over that this Rotu tribe wanted to vote me off.
283,00:18:59.23,00:18:59.23,>> I'm about ready to get axed. >> Eh.
284,00:19:01.27,00:19:01.27,">> No, I'm serious. I believe it."
285,00:19:04.57,00:19:04.57,"So I don't know what to do. Powerful people on this beach,"
286,00:19:09.10,00:19:09.10,"if you ask me. They're playing us, just so you"
287,00:19:12.17,00:19:12.17,know. They're playing you and Neleh
288,00:19:14.20,00:19:14.20,"too, and I just want you to understand that."
289,00:19:16.63,00:19:16.63,">> Oh, I understand that completely."
290,00:19:18.03,00:19:18.03,>> Yeah. I think it's time to find out
291,00:19:19.53,00:19:19.53,how we all are playing out in these people's minds.
292,00:19:23.07,00:19:23.07,Not just sit and wait to get voted off.
293,00:19:28.63,00:19:28.63,">> Well, when we first landed, Kathy, I think she may have been"
294,00:19:32.70,00:19:32.70,advised by Rob either on the way over here or sometime shortly
295,00:19:37.50,00:19:37.50,"after we got here, that she was being looked at very closely as"
296,00:19:40.90,00:19:40.90,"a possible first elimination, and she was really upset about"
297,00:19:44.27,00:19:44.27,"it. I just told Kathy, I said look,"
298,00:19:46.30,00:19:46.30,"you know, I'll listen and maybe there's an opportunity that"
299,00:19:49.57,00:19:49.57,"we'll find ourselves in, and if I do, I'll let you know."
300,00:19:52.73,00:19:52.73,I just didn't want her to get in a confrontational mode this
301,00:19:56.13,00:19:56.13,"early on after reuniting. >> By God, it's a game."
302,00:19:59.10,00:19:59.10,But I don't think lying fits into games.
303,00:20:01.63,00:20:01.63,"So just tell me the truth, man, and keep it upfront because"
304,00:20:05.57,00:20:05.57,I just can't deal with lying. And integrity is critical in
305,00:20:09.60,00:20:09.60,"this game, I feel. So I really appreciate it."
306,00:20:21.13,00:20:21.13,>> Those little white ball things-- I don't know what those
307,00:20:24.33,00:20:24.33,are called. >> A couple people said that you
308,00:20:27.47,00:20:27.47,absolutely should not lie to play this game.
309,00:20:30.83,00:20:30.83,"Let's, you know, start something new."
310,00:20:32.53,00:20:32.53,Let's tell everybody before they're going to get voted out
311,00:20:35.30,00:20:35.30,"and let's not lie, ever. And you know what, that is just"
312,00:20:39.63,00:20:39.63,"great, up here. But it's not realistic."
313,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,>> I don't want any bugs crawling in my ears.
314,00:20:44.90,00:20:44.90,Same here. >> This is a game about being
315,00:20:48.87,00:20:48.87,"the smartest person, outwitting, outplaying and outlasting"
316,00:20:52.40,00:20:52.40,"everybody else, and you may have to tell a white lie along the"
317,00:20:56.13,00:20:56.13,way or two or three. But I went into this game
318,00:20:59.23,00:20:59.23,knowing that I was going to do what it takes to win the game.
319,00:21:03.77,00:21:03.77,I hope when all is said and done that these people still look at
320,00:21:06.83,00:21:06.83,me and still like me. I don't intend to lie to any of
321,00:21:09.40,00:21:09.40,"their faces, but I do intend to play the game and win it."
322,00:21:26.23,00:21:26.23,>> What's up? Should we have a little talk?
323,00:21:30.97,00:21:30.97,>> Sure. >> I wanted to talk to you two
324,00:21:32.63,00:21:32.63,privately. Sure.
325,00:21:33.53,00:21:33.53,>> Branch down here to sit on. >> I want to talk about a couple
326,00:21:39.70,00:21:39.70,things. >> Oh...
327,00:21:42.50,00:21:42.50,>> I'm just curious. Who you guys voting for?
328,00:21:44.63,00:21:44.63,>> I haven't figured my vote. >> I don't think it's any of
329,00:21:47.07,00:21:47.07,"your business, first of all. >> I find you amazing, Zoe."
330,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,>> Excuse me? >> I find you amazing.
331,00:21:50.83,00:21:50.83,">> Why thank you. >> I trust you, and everybody is"
332,00:21:54.13,00:21:54.13,"lying, left and right. >> You know what it is, it's all"
333,00:21:57.40,00:21:57.40,"about tribal loyalty. There's still a ghost of Rotu,"
334,00:21:59.70,00:21:59.70,"and that's what the problem is. >> Right, but that wasn't the"
335,00:22:02.47,00:22:02.47,"way it was supposed to be, was it, Zoe?"
336,00:22:04.20,00:22:04.20,"I mean, I thought we had an agreement, Zoe, you know?"
337,00:22:06.60,00:22:06.60,"You and I and John and Tammy and Sean, and Vecepia and Rob."
338,00:22:11.80,00:22:11.80,>> Agreement about? >> Didn't we have an agreement
339,00:22:14.13,00:22:14.13,about taking everybody from their side of the island off?
340,00:22:16.83,00:22:16.83,You don't remember anything about that?
341,00:22:19.07,00:22:19.07,">> No. >> See, this is what I mean."
342,00:22:21.10,00:22:21.10,Unbelievable. And Kathy wasn't your first
343,00:22:23.30,00:22:23.30,"choice as soon as she got here, and we promised that if we got"
344,00:22:26.37,00:22:26.37,rid of Gabe that we'd stay together?
345,00:22:28.07,00:22:28.07,>> How did you ever get that? >> How do I ever get that?
346,00:22:31.40,00:22:31.40,"Unbelievable. Tell the truth, go on, will you?"
347,00:22:34.20,00:22:34.20,"Tell the truth. Don't worry, everybody."
348,00:22:36.70,00:22:36.70,"I'm telling everybody tonight, Zoe, everybody."
349,00:22:39.80,00:22:39.80,"The other day, didn't you tell me you were voting for Kathy,"
350,00:22:42.53,00:22:42.53,"yes or no? >> No, I didn't."
351,00:22:47.83,00:22:47.83,">> No, you didn't? You paused and you lied."
352,00:22:50.77,00:22:50.77,I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
353,00:22:52.93,00:22:52.93,"It was like a certain degree of trust that I felt, among the"
354,00:22:56.20,00:22:56.20,group. And it completely got shattered.
355,00:23:00.23,00:23:00.23,"Where you going? You leaving, Kathy?"
356,00:23:02.60,00:23:02.60,">> Yeah, for crying out loud, I get a story from you and then I"
357,00:23:05.53,00:23:05.53,"get a story from Zoe and people are lying through their teeth,"
358,00:23:08.43,00:23:08.43,"and I haven't lied once, man. I don't know what this stupid"
359,00:23:12.80,00:23:12.80,"game is about, but I'm out of here."
360,00:23:13.93,00:23:13.93,">> You can believe what you want to believe, okay."
361,00:23:16.77,00:23:16.77,">> I don't like to be lied to, and then again and again and"
362,00:23:20.17,00:23:20.17,again. It irritates me.
363,00:23:44.87,00:23:44.87,>> Zoe is lying to me. They're all lying to me.
364,00:23:48.10,00:23:48.10,"They're all lying to me, and I'm being played as a pawn."
365,00:23:51.90,00:23:51.90,A pawn. I need the immunity because I'm
366,00:23:59.30,00:23:59.30,getting the ax. I don't know.
367,00:24:01.20,00:24:01.20,"It's just not adding up, but I'm going to trust what Rob told me,"
368,00:24:04.77,00:24:04.77,and I need immunity to stay in the game.
369,00:24:22.03,00:24:22.03,">> PROBST: First things first. As always, Edgar is coming back."
370,00:24:27.40,00:24:27.40,"Let me say, congratulations on making the merge."
371,00:24:30.07,00:24:30.07,The good news is you now have a one in ten shot of being the
372,00:24:33.00,00:24:33.00,sole survivor. Now because we are an individual
373,00:24:35.30,00:24:35.30,"immunity, the idol is no more. This is what you covet."
374,00:24:38.27,00:24:38.27,"Since you're now competing against one another, you have a"
375,00:24:41.90,00:24:41.90,chance to win individual immunity.
376,00:24:44.03,00:24:44.03,"Win it, you alone are safe from the vote."
377,00:24:45.77,00:24:45.77,"To win it, you're going to have to have some good sea legs for"
378,00:24:48.47,00:24:48.47,our immunity challenge today. Each tribe member will stand on
379,00:24:51.53,00:24:51.53,a platform in the water. The person to stand the longest
380,00:24:54.67,00:24:54.67,without falling off wins. Only your feet may touch the
381,00:24:57.83,00:24:57.83,platform. Any other body part touches the
382,00:25:00.37,00:25:00.37,"platform, you're out. You've randomly drawn numbers"
383,00:25:02.97,00:25:02.97,for which platform you'll stand on.
384,00:25:04.50,00:25:04.50,Take your spot on your platform. Wait for my go.
385,00:25:08.63,00:25:08.63,">> Good luck, guys. >> PROBST: Immunity at stake."
386,00:25:16.13,00:25:16.13,Survivors ready? >> Ready.
387,00:25:18.00,00:25:18.00,>> PROBST: Go! Challenge is on!
388,00:25:29.80,00:25:29.80,"Neleh, you touched the platform. Neleh and General are down."
389,00:25:38.07,00:25:38.07,"Neleh, General, take a spot on the shoreline."
390,00:25:47.43,00:25:47.43,Paschal is down. >> Watch out.
391,00:25:54.47,00:25:54.47,There you go! Bye-bye!
392,00:25:59.30,00:25:59.30,>> PROBST: V. is down. Going to do the backstroke to
393,00:26:02.83,00:26:02.83,"the beach. Zoe, you look very comfortable"
394,00:26:07.50,00:26:07.50,"out there. >> Nice recovery, John."
395,00:26:24.90,00:26:24.90,"Oh, baby. >> Come on, Johnny."
396,00:26:36.03,00:26:36.03,">> PROBST: Sorry, Sean, you touched."
397,00:26:39.03,00:26:39.03,"Down to five. Zoe, you're out."
398,00:26:51.97,00:26:51.97,">> Oh. >> Hang in there, buddy."
399,00:26:54.70,00:26:54.70,Hang in there. >> Whoa!
400,00:27:08.20,00:27:08.20,Whoa! >> He touched it!
401,00:27:17.23,00:27:17.23,">> PROBST: Whoa, Rob. You're done."
402,00:27:22.43,00:27:22.43,>> Told you about being a wise ass.
403,00:27:26.57,00:27:26.57,">> Oh, God. >> Steady foot, John!"
404,00:27:31.73,00:27:31.73,">> Go, Johnny, pots and pans. Baby!"
405,00:27:37.87,00:27:37.87,>> PROBST: Tammy goes in head first.
406,00:27:40.13,00:27:40.13,Take a spot on the shoreline. We are down to two.
407,00:27:43.77,00:27:43.77,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: John and Kathy.
408,00:27:48.03,00:27:48.03,For immunity. >> So many times he's like
409,00:27:52.30,00:27:52.30,"stumbled and he just stay there, man."
410,00:27:54.10,00:27:54.10,And he hasn't touched once. He just stays up there.
411,00:28:01.83,00:28:01.83,Kathy is holding in there. >> Kathy is pretty steady.
412,00:28:14.47,00:28:14.47,Steady. >> PROBST: Whoa.
413,00:28:25.10,00:28:25.10,John. Kathy wins immunity.
414,00:28:31.57,00:28:31.57,"You lost your concentration, John."
415,00:28:33.57,00:28:33.57,Kathy. >> What?
416,00:28:34.57,00:28:34.57,>> PROBST: You want this? >> Yeah!
417,00:28:36.80,00:28:36.80,">> PROBST: Come get it. >> All right, baby!"
418,00:28:42.20,00:28:42.20,(cheering) Well earned.
419,00:28:47.50,00:28:47.50,Well earned. >> PROBST: Turn around here.
420,00:28:49.97,00:28:49.97,Here we go. >> Yes!
421,00:29:23.57,00:29:23.57,>> It's terrible living over here with these people.
422,00:29:26.10,00:29:26.10,They're all trying to merge into one like they're one big happy
423,00:29:29.27,00:29:29.27,"family. The way I see it now, Kathy"
424,00:29:33.50,00:29:33.50,"probably blabbed to John, ratted me out."
425,00:29:37.33,00:29:37.33,"John's slick, but he's not as smart as he thinks he is."
426,00:29:43.43,00:29:43.43,"See the thing is, you can't have secrets too long in this game,"
427,00:29:46.57,00:29:46.57,especially in an individual situation like we're in now.
428,00:29:49.73,00:29:49.73,"But within the next two Tribal Councils, John is going to get"
429,00:29:52.80,00:29:52.80,"exposed one way or another. I mean, that's the game."
430,00:29:55.43,00:29:55.43,"If you can figure out what buttons to push on what people,"
431,00:29:58.37,00:29:58.37,then you're going to have the advantage.
432,00:30:17.47,00:30:17.47,">> Hey, what's up? Where you going tonight?"
433,00:30:20.03,00:30:20.03,>> I have no idea. >> I thought we were taking them
434,00:30:22.87,00:30:22.87,out one at a time. >> There's lots of things we
435,00:30:25.27,00:30:25.27,came up with. >> What happened about my word
436,00:30:27.93,00:30:27.93,"is my bond? >> Oh, yeah, mine was fine"
437,00:30:30.00,00:30:30.00,until you went right to Kathy and went right over at that
438,00:30:32.83,00:30:32.83,"other side and said, ""They're going to vote you out first."""
439,00:30:35.80,00:30:35.80,>> I did not say that to Kathy. >> I'm not going to have this
440,00:30:38.37,00:30:38.37,conversation. Don't lie to my face.
441,00:30:39.83,00:30:39.83,">> There we go. Now it's on, man."
442,00:30:41.67,00:30:41.67,"Now it's personal. >> No, no."
443,00:30:43.30,00:30:43.30,You know why it's personal because you're going to stand
444,00:30:46.13,00:30:46.13,here and act like you didn't have that conversation.
445,00:30:48.80,00:30:48.80,">> You're over here, Mr. I'm Not Lying."
446,00:30:50.80,00:30:50.80,">> We had conversations. We looked each other in the eye,"
447,00:30:53.17,00:30:53.17,looked each other in the eye. And if it would have rested and
448,00:30:55.73,00:30:55.73,"it would have stayed still, then I would have been like fine"
449,00:30:58.00,00:30:58.00,with it. >> So why you didn't come to me
450,00:30:59.37,00:30:59.37,"man to man, then, John? >> Because at that point you"
451,00:31:01.53,00:31:01.53,betrayed me. >> How I betray you?
452,00:31:05.57,00:31:05.57,">> This is too much drama. >> Obviously, it was a mutual"
453,00:31:10.33,00:31:10.33,agreement between everybody. Now this changed?
454,00:31:12.93,00:31:12.93,">> Dude, how can it be a mutual agreement?"
455,00:31:15.30,00:31:15.30,"Each person is an individual, they get to decide."
456,00:31:17.33,00:31:17.33,>> Why wasn't the individual vote thrown in when it was
457,00:31:19.63,00:31:19.63,Gabriel's turn to get voted out? It wasn't individual then.
458,00:31:22.17,00:31:22.17,"It was a (blip) alliance of seven, right?"
459,00:31:24.00,00:31:24.00,Don't hand me that individual's (blip) when Gabe's ass was time
460,00:31:26.63,00:31:26.63,to get out because he didn't fit into your plan.
461,00:31:28.63,00:31:28.63,"So he had to go. Now we're talking about, well,"
462,00:31:30.67,00:31:30.67,everybody got their own vote. Everybody got their own vote.
463,00:31:33.23,00:31:33.23,"You all got a four thing going, you included us and said, ""All"
464,00:31:35.97,00:31:35.97,"right, we're going to go in seven."""
465,00:31:37.50,00:31:37.50,"Everybody was like, ""We team. We team."""
466,00:31:39.20,00:31:39.20,">> You flat out said... >> But I'm saying, don't tell me"
467,00:31:42.40,00:31:42.40,one thing and just because I think about something or just
468,00:31:46.20,00:31:46.20,"because I talk to somebody, then all of a sudden it's off."
469,00:31:48.87,00:31:48.87,>> So wait a minute. What am I supposed to be?
470,00:31:50.63,00:31:50.63,"Like, naive? >> You're not playing both"
471,00:31:52.33,00:31:52.33,"sides? >> I'm not playing both sides,"
472,00:31:54.07,00:31:54.07,"Rob. >> It's all right, well,"
473,00:31:55.37,00:31:55.37,"everything is coming out tonight, so don't worry."
474,00:31:57.67,00:31:57.67,>> It's already out. What more do you want?
475,00:31:59.80,00:31:59.80,It's already out. >> I hope you don't have any
476,00:32:02.17,00:32:02.17,secrets. This here is getting clean.
477,00:32:03.97,00:32:03.97,">> That's fine. I'm totally clean, too."
478,00:32:05.93,00:32:05.93,I have no worries. >> Cool.
479,00:32:08.63,00:32:08.63,">> Rob, you want to vote me out tonight, vote me out."
480,00:32:11.23,00:32:11.23,"But tell me man to man like Gabe did, okay?"
481,00:32:14.00,00:32:14.00,"Okay, bud? Don't go to Kathy and say..."
482,00:32:16.20,00:32:16.20,">> I've been true to one person had this whole thing, me."
483,00:32:19.50,00:32:19.50,I keep my word to me. >> I hear you.
484,00:32:21.00,00:32:21.00,"I hear you. I keep my word to myself, too."
485,00:32:22.77,00:32:22.77,">> I've told nobody nothing, and that's the way it is."
486,00:32:25.07,00:32:25.07,>> You haven't told anybody anything?
487,00:32:26.63,00:32:26.63,>> I made no alliances to you. I made no alliances to nobody.
488,00:32:29.23,00:32:29.23,I just keep my word to myself. >> That's what I'm saying.
489,00:32:31.77,00:32:31.77,That's cool. >> I haven't talked to anybody.
490,00:32:33.83,00:32:33.83,"Nobody's talked to me. Fine, I'm happy."
491,00:32:35.67,00:32:35.67,I do my own thing. >> That's fine.
492,00:32:37.23,00:32:37.23,If you're telling the truth... >> I'm The General and that's
493,00:32:39.87,00:32:39.87,that. >> Cool.
494,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00,>> It's tough because you're looking for angles.
495,00:32:44.80,00:32:44.80,You're constantly looking for an angle to play.
496,00:32:49.13,00:32:49.13,"Maybe everybody is lying, you know."
497,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,"Who knows? >> Five years ago, I'd have been"
498,00:33:00.63,00:33:00.63,worse than Rob. I probably wanted to push John
499,00:33:03.13,00:33:03.13,into that freaking fire. The reason I'm more upset
500,00:33:05.57,00:33:05.57,because I've had personal one-on-ones with John and we've
501,00:33:08.40,00:33:08.40,"self-disclosed stuff. How it's like to be a black man,"
502,00:33:10.77,00:33:10.77,"how it's like to be a gay man, what it's like to be isolated."
503,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,We shared moments that got nothing to do with this game.
504,00:33:15.87,00:33:15.87,"And when we share those kind of moments, and then you come and"
505,00:33:19.03,00:33:19.03,"try to pull some BS like this, it's really hurtful."
506,00:33:23.80,00:33:23.80,>> What outfit should I wear tonight to Tribal Council?
507,00:33:28.07,00:33:28.07,">> Now everybody is back to that love tribe, happy family thing,"
508,00:33:30.57,00:33:30.57,"so I didn't expect it to be that way, but it is."
509,00:33:34.07,00:33:34.07,God only knows how many people are real about it.
510,00:33:36.77,00:33:36.77,"It's flipping me out. >> Like I said, day one is"
511,00:33:40.30,00:33:40.30,completely different than day 21 or whatever.
512,00:33:43.00,00:33:43.00,>> Let's go over it so I feel better.
513,00:33:45.20,00:33:45.20,"Okay, babe. Thank you."
514,00:33:46.47,00:33:46.47,"I just have to keep telling myself it's a game, and get into"
515,00:33:49.80,00:33:49.80,"this peculiar act of kissy and love, and I love you, but guess"
516,00:33:53.27,00:33:53.27,"what, when we go to the next Tribal Council, you're out."
517,00:34:23.17,00:34:23.17,>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal Council.
518,00:34:25.07,00:34:25.07,Congratulations on making it this far.
519,00:34:27.07,00:34:27.07,"Survive tonight, you are guaranteed a place in the jury"
520,00:34:30.37,00:34:30.37,and a chance to be the sole Survivor.
521,00:34:32.77,00:34:32.77,"Let's start at the top. V, is it a different mindset"
522,00:34:36.03,00:34:36.03,"now that it's no longer two tribes facing off, but it is ten"
523,00:34:39.63,00:34:39.63,individuals? >> Most definitely.
524,00:34:41.67,00:34:41.67,I think it is a different mindset because you're coming
525,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,from competing as a group entity to competing one-on-one.
526,00:34:49.40,00:34:49.40,So you're no longer looking at the other person as your
527,00:34:53.20,00:34:53.20,"teammate per se, but looking at each and every one of these as"
528,00:34:57.07,00:34:57.07,"our adversary. I mean, they're all our great"
529,00:34:59.87,00:34:59.87,"friends, but this is my adversary now."
530,00:35:02.40,00:35:02.40,"This is my adversary now, but we love each other very much."
531,00:35:05.20,00:35:05.20,">> PROBST: Sean, what's the mood of this tribe?"
532,00:35:07.93,00:35:07.93,">> I feel like the outsider, quite frankly, because it is an"
533,00:35:12.10,00:35:12.10,old reunion of old tribe members.
534,00:35:14.40,00:35:14.40,"I can't speak for Maraamu right now is a mixture of emotions,"
535,00:35:18.30,00:35:18.30,"right now, because I'm fighting for my life individually, since"
536,00:35:22.33,00:35:22.33,"I came over, I felt like. >> PROBST: Zoe, how do you"
537,00:35:26.07,00:35:26.07,"respond to Sean feeling like, you know what, I don't have a"
538,00:35:29.67,00:35:29.67,"shot in hell right now, because you guys all have a pact and no"
539,00:35:32.23,00:35:32.23,"matter what I do, no matter how I contribute, you'll never let"
540,00:35:34.80,00:35:34.80,"me in the group? >> Well, I don't think that's"
541,00:35:37.10,00:35:37.10,necessarily the case. Everybody has their own feelings
542,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57,"about, you know, how strong they feel within our family and our"
543,00:35:44.50,00:35:44.50,tribe. And if that's the way Sean
544,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,"feels, I feel sorry for him feeling that way, but if that's"
545,00:35:51.20,00:35:51.20,"the way he feels, I don't see that."
546,00:35:53.80,00:35:53.80,">> PROBST: How about you, General?"
547,00:35:55.43,00:35:55.43,What's your point of view on how far you'll go in this game?
548,00:35:58.37,00:35:58.37,>> I'll never do anything to compromise my values.
549,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,"You know, I am who I am, and I, you know, my word is my bond."
550,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,"I'm not a youngster. You know, my word is all I got."
551,00:36:10.03,00:36:10.03,">> PROBST: John, same for you? I think you've told me that, you"
552,00:36:13.30,00:36:13.30,"know, I'm going to tell you the way it is."
553,00:36:15.47,00:36:15.47,">> My personal rule is that, you know, if somebody wants to have"
554,00:36:19.10,00:36:19.10,"a bond with me or whatever you want to call it, fine."
555,00:36:22.13,00:36:22.13,"Come talk to me, and if I agree to it, that's great."
556,00:36:24.23,00:36:24.23,"If you come to me and say one thing, and you agree to it, and"
557,00:36:27.77,00:36:27.77,then you immediately turn around and start adjusting it without
558,00:36:31.47,00:36:31.47,"telling me you're adjusting it, to me that's the same as lying."
559,00:36:35.17,00:36:35.17,">> PROBST: How about you, Rob? Are you happy with the way you"
560,00:36:37.43,00:36:37.43,played? >> I'm happy with the way I've
561,00:36:38.83,00:36:38.83,play the game. >> PROBST: Have you lied?
562,00:36:40.73,00:36:40.73,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Anybody else here
563,00:36:43.27,00:36:43.27,lied to you? >> Without a doubt people have
564,00:36:45.80,00:36:45.80,lied to me. People that are sitting here
565,00:36:47.93,00:36:47.93,"telling you right now that they have not lied, they have lied."
566,00:36:51.27,00:36:51.27,Those people know who they are. I don't feel it's necessary to
567,00:36:55.37,00:36:55.37,"one by one single them out, but I think people need to be able"
568,00:36:59.23,00:36:59.23,to look in the mirror at themselves after and if they're
569,00:37:02.47,00:37:02.47,"happy with the way they played the game, that's fair enough for"
570,00:37:06.03,00:37:06.03,me. >> PROBST: All right.
571,00:37:07.37,00:37:07.37,"There's a new facet now to immunity, now that we've reached"
572,00:37:10.53,00:37:10.53,"the individual stage, and it works like this."
573,00:37:12.93,00:37:12.93,"When you win immunity, you now own immunity, and you can assign"
574,00:37:17.57,00:37:17.57,"that immunity to somebody else. So if you feel very secure, you"
575,00:37:22.13,00:37:22.13,"can buy a favor, you can buy somebody's vote, you can protect"
576,00:37:26.43,00:37:26.43,somebody if you want simply by giving your immunity to them.
577,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,"Kathy, you didn't have the luxury of negotiating today."
578,00:37:34.10,00:37:34.10,So I'll put you on the spot now. And are you secure enough now to
579,00:37:38.37,00:37:38.37,give that immunity to somebody else?
580,00:37:40.73,00:37:40.73,>> After what I went through today?
581,00:37:42.83,00:37:42.83,I do not feel secure. Because I feel that there were
582,00:37:45.93,00:37:45.93,some really strange things that happened today with deceit and
583,00:37:49.60,00:37:49.60,lies that I'll talk to people about it and hopefully get it
584,00:37:53.07,00:37:53.07,"resolved, but I question the whole loyalty thing."
585,00:37:55.97,00:37:55.97,It evaporated. So the immunity to me right now
586,00:38:00.20,00:38:00.20,is important. >> PROBST: It's time to vote.
587,00:38:03.03,00:38:03.03,Kathy is the only one safe from the vote.
588,00:38:05.27,00:38:05.27,"Neleh, you're first. >> Boston Rob, I'm voting for"
589,00:38:28.30,00:38:28.30,"you, boy. You tried to stir up a lot of"
590,00:38:30.67,00:38:30.67,stuff today. I knew from the beginning that
591,00:38:32.93,00:38:32.93,you weren't going to keep your word.
592,00:38:34.70,00:38:34.70,"You attacked me personally, so I'm more than happy to put this"
593,00:38:37.73,00:38:37.73,in here for you. >> I vote for Johnny.
594,00:38:51.83,00:38:51.83,"You play the game real well. Hopefully, if things swing"
595,00:38:55.33,00:38:55.33,"right, you'll be gone. If not we'll see you on the flip"
596,00:38:58.53,00:38:58.53,"side. >> Yo, look here, man."
597,00:39:09.03,00:39:09.03,"I'm voting for you because you dissed me and my boy, and if I"
598,00:39:11.87,00:39:11.87,"get voted out next, I really don't give a damn."
599,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,But your time is coming. You definitely lied to us.
600,00:39:18.00,00:39:18.00,"That's for me and you, dawg. >> My vote tonight is for Rob"
601,00:39:40.57,00:39:40.57,"Mariano. Brother, you know, we came into"
602,00:39:43.13,00:39:43.13,"this tribe with not the right numbers, so we were kind of"
603,00:39:46.70,00:39:46.70,down. But I know soon I'll have to set
604,00:39:50.17,00:39:50.17,up that debt for the Maraamu tribe and give you guys all
605,00:39:54.20,00:39:54.20,pizza and beer. I'm looking forward to it.
606,00:39:56.70,00:39:56.70,See you soon. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
607,00:40:04.03,00:40:04.03,"votes. Once the votes are read,"
608,00:40:19.00,00:40:19.00,the decision is final. The person will be asked to
609,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
610,00:40:22.67,00:40:22.67,I'll read the votes. First vote...
611,00:40:29.10,00:40:29.10,Rob. Rob.
612,00:40:40.97,00:40:40.97,John. John.
613,00:40:54.57,00:40:54.57,"Three votes Rob, two votes John. Zoe."
614,00:41:07.17,00:41:07.17,"Four votes Rob, two votes John, one vote Zoe."
615,00:41:13.57,00:41:13.57,Rob. That's five.
616,00:41:19.57,00:41:19.57,Seventh person voted out of the tribe: Boston Rob.
617,00:41:23.43,00:41:23.43,"No need to read the last vote. Rob, the tribe has spoken."
618,00:41:35.27,00:41:35.27,">> Good luck, guys. >> PROBST: Well, you've made it"
619,00:41:52.37,00:41:52.37,"21 days. You've reached the final nine,"
620,00:41:54.93,00:41:54.93,which means the fate of two of you rests in the hands of the
621,00:41:59.07,00:41:59.07,"others. And from what I heard tonight,"
622,00:42:01.73,00:42:01.73,should make for a very interesting final 18 days.
623,00:42:05.10,00:42:05.10,You guys can head back to camp. See you tomorrow.
624,00:42:19.17,00:42:19.17,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
625,00:42:25.07,00:42:25.07,>> PROBST: Next time on  Survivor:
626,00:42:26.33,00:42:26.33,Kathy confronts Zoe about her lying ways.
627,00:42:29.07,00:42:29.07,>> There was never any intention of voting you off.
628,00:42:31.33,00:42:31.33,>> Zoe just lied to me point-blank.
629,00:42:33.33,00:42:33.33,>> The Survivors reach new heights.
630,00:42:35.33,00:42:35.33,Fly! Neleh gets upset with the
631,00:42:37.70,00:42:37.70,actions of some of her tribe mates.
632,00:42:39.77,00:42:39.77,>> I've been nothing but honest to everybody.
633,00:42:41.67,00:42:41.67,I'm following my heart. There's got to be something
634,00:42:43.77,00:42:43.77,changed here. >> I like people to know that
635,00:42:51.43,00:42:51.43,"this was a game, and I hope everybody doesn't take so much"
636,00:42:54.70,00:42:54.70,of everything that I said seriously.
637,00:42:56.67,00:42:56.67,I was trying to be funny. It's just my personality.
638,00:42:59.23,00:42:59.23,I definitely enjoyed the game. I like trying to manipulate more
639,00:43:02.50,00:43:02.50,than anything else. I hope nobody comes away with
640,00:43:04.97,00:43:04.97,any bad feelings afterwards. I hope we can all be friends.
