381,00:25:14.71,00:25:14.71,"Adam, safe from the votetonight."
382,00:25:16.92,00:25:16.92,But here is a fact: one of youguys is going home tonight.
383,00:25:20.25,00:25:20.25,"See you at tribal.Grab your stuff, head on back to"
384,00:25:21.79,00:25:21.79,"camp.>> Take a little one, and you"
385,00:25:39.25,00:25:39.25,pop it.>> Welcome back.
386,00:25:42.33,00:25:42.33,>> Thank you.Adam won immunity today at the
387,00:25:44.42,00:25:44.42,"challenge, so tonight we'regoing to tribal council, and"
388,00:25:48.12,00:25:48.12,it's looking like my number'sup.
389,00:25:51.08,00:25:51.08,It's upsetting to think thatJonathan will get farther than
390,00:25:53.79,00:25:53.79,"me in this game, and that'supsetting to think that someone"
391,00:25:57.79,00:25:57.79,"that everyone feels-- everyone,even the people in his alliance"
392,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,"feel that Jonathan is a snake.>> Jonathan's just a slime ball,"
393,00:26:07.96,00:26:07.96,"and he needs to be voted off.>> I mean, I understand why you"
394,00:26:10.58,00:26:10.58,"don't like Jonathan, but howdoes this help you?"
395,00:26:13.21,00:26:13.21,>> I don't care.>> It doesn't help us...
396,00:26:14.67,00:26:14.67,>> I'll be at peace with myselfif he's voted out before us.
397,00:26:17.58,00:26:17.58,">> Honestly, I will feel like Ihave won if he is voted out"
398,00:26:20.25,00:26:20.25,before I am.>> You're an upstanding guy.
399,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,">> He's behind you, Yul.>> Got a flounder."
400,00:26:35.08,00:26:35.08,">> Yeah, my first flounder.>> Nice."
401,00:26:40.17,00:26:40.17,">> If we can get a fire going,we can cook some fish."
402,00:26:47.08,00:26:47.08,">> Adam, Parvati, and Candiceapproached me today."
403,00:26:49.88,00:26:49.88,"They really want Jonathan out ofthe game, so they asked me, kind"
404,00:26:52.75,00:26:52.75,"of appealing to my sense of, youknow, justice and integrity, to"
405,00:26:56.42,00:26:56.42,please vote him off first.Jonathan is not my first choice
406,00:26:59.79,00:26:59.79,"to kind of welcome him back.Like, he's... you know, he is"
407,00:27:03.12,00:27:03.12,what he is.>> I think you're
408,00:27:04.88,00:27:04.88,underestimating him.>> Let me finish.
409,00:27:06.38,00:27:06.38,"I understand how he thinks,right?"
410,00:27:08.00,00:27:08.00,"The guy is selfish, and he'srational, right?"
411,00:27:11.04,00:27:11.04,"So I can predict, basically,what he's going to go for."
412,00:27:14.12,00:27:14.12,"I can predict, like, what makessense to him."
413,00:27:29.17,00:27:29.17,>> I'm not the ring leader.I mean...
414,00:27:31.12,00:27:31.12,">> Yeah, you are.>> Let me just... it's not that"
415,00:27:36.38,00:27:36.38,simple.If we change things up right
416,00:27:38.21,00:27:38.21,"now, it will have otherramifications, and you know,"
417,00:27:40.92,00:27:40.92,"obviously, I can't really talkabout that stuff."
418,00:27:57.29,00:27:57.29,>> Adam was eating that.Are you taking that away?
419,00:27:59.17,00:27:59.17,">> Oh, I'm sorry.>> Yeah, what are you doing?"
420,00:28:00.42,00:28:00.42,>> I didn't realize it was yourcoconut.
421,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,"No, no, you eat it.>> No, I don't want it!"
422,00:28:04.62,00:28:04.62,You eat it!>> Then what's the problem?
423,00:28:08.25,00:28:08.25,"All I did was pick it up so Icould share it, that's all."
424,00:28:11.08,00:28:11.08,">> Well, cut it up, eat it.>> Great, thank you."
425,00:28:14.08,00:28:14.08,>> It's not that complicated.>> I'll go get some more
426,00:28:16.92,00:28:16.92,firewood so we can make somefish.
427,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,Things finally came to a head.They've been percolating and
428,00:28:29.08,00:28:29.08,"brewing, a lot of silence, a lotof glares, and I'm getting a"
429,00:28:32.96,00:28:32.96,little mad.( laughter )
430,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,>> You did not miss me.You have not been cuddly.
431,00:28:38.08,00:28:38.08,>> I missed you.>> And you know what?
432,00:28:40.00,00:28:40.00,You missed your last night tocuddle.
433,00:28:41.42,00:28:41.42,You missed your last cuddlychance.
434,00:28:44.75,00:28:44.75,">> I'm uncomfortable!>> Okay, come here, we'll give"
435,00:28:48.25,00:28:48.25,"you a smooch too.>> Jonathan, thank you for the"
436,00:29:11.38,00:29:11.38,fish.>> Yeah.
437,00:29:12.75,00:29:12.75,">> Thank you, Jonathan.>> You're so welcome, guys, of"
438,00:29:14.21,00:29:14.21,course.I wish it could be more.
439,00:29:23.12,00:29:23.12,>> Where'd they all go?Are they eating?
440,00:29:26.38,00:29:26.38,">> Yeah, probably.>> That is wrong."
441,00:29:30.88,00:29:30.88,"That's coming out at tribal.All right, I'll be back."
442,00:29:38.25,00:29:38.25,"( thunder )>> What's going on, guys?"
443,00:29:46.29,00:29:46.29,">> Well, what do you mean?>> I mean, since when do you"
444,00:29:49.88,00:29:49.88,guys not share food?This is so arrogant and so rude.
445,00:29:55.29,00:29:55.29,"I can't believe this.>> Didn't you call me a... well,"
446,00:29:59.42,00:29:59.42,it doesn't matter.>> Didn't I call you a what?
447,00:30:02.12,00:30:02.12,>> I was told that I was adisgusting rat and that I should
448,00:30:05.88,00:30:05.88,be voted against tonight forwhatever reason.
449,00:30:07.58,00:30:07.58,">> Well, Jonathan, you're a ratbecause you betrayed everybody"
450,00:30:09.33,00:30:09.33,"in this game.>> Okay, well... and yet... and"
451,00:30:13.17,00:30:13.17,yet...>> Everybody knows that you only
452,00:30:14.54,00:30:14.54,care about yourself.Yul said it this afternoon that
453,00:30:17.29,00:30:17.29,he can predict your behaviorbecause you're selfish...
454,00:30:20.12,00:30:20.12,>> Self-interested.>> ...and that you're... so he
455,00:30:23.88,00:30:23.88,knows what you're going to do.He knows what move you're going
456,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,to make because you make theselfish decision.
457,00:30:28.12,00:30:28.12,">> Candice...>> And so everybody knows that,"
458,00:30:30.12,00:30:30.12,"and everybody...>> Candice, don't speak for me."
459,00:30:32.33,00:30:32.33,"I can speak for myself, allright?"
460,00:30:33.96,00:30:33.96,>> Then what did you say?>> This is not...
461,00:30:35.79,00:30:35.79,>> What did you say?>> This is not how I would...
462,00:30:37.25,00:30:37.25,">> What did you say?>> Look, I said he was a self-"
463,00:30:39.17,00:30:39.17,"interested, rational player,right?"
464,00:30:41.62,00:30:41.62,To that extent...>> You said he's selfish.
465,00:30:43.58,00:30:43.58,>> ...I have certainty as to howhe's going to predict... that I
466,00:30:45.67,00:30:45.67,"can predict his behavior,because I know what's going to"
467,00:30:47.58,00:30:47.58,"like...>> And you don't like Jonathan,"
468,00:30:49.21,00:30:49.21,and you said that too.And all these people have said
469,00:30:55.12,00:30:55.12,"that, that they don't like you.>> Let's talk about this meal."
470,00:31:00.25,00:31:00.25,We all came home from that...>> Everybody has their days
471,00:31:02.92,00:31:02.92,where they lay down in the tent.>> You know what?
472,00:31:05.08,00:31:05.08,"That's bollocks, and you knowit."
473,00:31:06.92,00:31:06.92,The rest of us do not choose ourdays to go lay down in the tent.
474,00:31:09.29,00:31:09.29,I work my ass off every singleday.
475,00:31:11.50,00:31:11.50,">> Yeah, because you're tryingto weasel your way in somehow."
476,00:31:14.00,00:31:14.00,">> But luckily you're not namecalling, I appreciate that."
477,00:31:16.00,00:31:16.00,>> I'm not.I'm saying you're trying to
478,00:31:17.75,00:31:17.75,weasel your way in.>> How dare you...
479,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,">> ""Weasel"" is a verb in thissituation."
480,00:31:22.79,00:31:22.79,>> How dare you imply...>> Weasel your way in.
481,00:31:24.79,00:31:24.79,>> Excuse me.How dare you imply that I'm
482,00:31:26.38,00:31:26.38,behaving differently today thanI have for the last 30 days.
483,00:31:30.50,00:31:30.50,You cannot say that that's true.It's not true.
484,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,>> You know...>> You know what?
485,00:31:34.25,00:31:34.25,And I don't even want to talkabout it.
486,00:31:35.92,00:31:35.92,You've said more than enough forme.
487,00:31:37.75,00:31:37.75,"Thank you.>> Oh, that's what you're"
488,00:31:52.83,00:31:52.83,"worried about, thinking they'regoing to be mad at you for not"
489,00:31:54.54,00:31:54.54,changing your vote?>> Do it again.
490,00:32:05.21,00:32:05.21,>> But I guess my question toyou is there's three of them.
491,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,Are you going to wait until eachone gets voted off to then vote
492,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,off Jonathan.They're basically all saying the
493,00:32:10.46,00:32:10.46,same thing.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
494,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,"the members of our jury: Brad,Rebecca, Jenny, and Nate, voted"
495,00:32:53.50,00:32:53.50,"out at the last tribal council.I'll remind you, the jury is"
496,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,here merely to observe.They're gathering information
497,00:33:06.08,00:33:06.08,for a million-dollar decision.Let's start with the auction.
498,00:33:12.04,00:33:12.04,"Becky, the turning point waswhen you sent Candice to Exile"
499,00:33:15.92,00:33:15.92,Island for the fourth time.Why Candice?
500,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,">> I think just seeing herstrength and her endurance, she"
501,00:33:22.50,00:33:22.50,was probably the fiercestcompetitor.
502,00:33:25.00,00:33:25.00,"She was the obvious choice.>> PROBST: Candice, you return"
503,00:33:28.46,00:33:28.46,"from Exile Island, yet you stillcome back with a smile on your"
504,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,face.>> I'm out here because I love
505,00:33:35.00,00:33:35.00,"this game, and it's been rough,you know?"
506,00:33:37.38,00:33:37.38,There have been some low points.But like Adam always asks
507,00:33:40.46,00:33:40.46,"everybody, ""Are you stillsmiling?"""
508,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"And you know, I think you haveto keep that spirit up or else,"
509,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,"you know, you'll collapse.>> PROBST: Ozzy, what happened"
510,00:33:49.25,00:33:49.25,when you got back to camp afterthe challenge?
511,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,>> I spent a good amount of timelooking for firewood and trying
512,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,to get the fire going.Jonathan went out fishing.
513,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,"Candice, Parvati, and Adam justwent into the tent basically and"
514,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,later on caused a huge ordealwith us five eating fish and
515,00:34:06.88,00:34:06.88,them three not eating the fish.>> Not sharing the fish.
516,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,>> PROBST: You say not eatingthe fish.
517,00:34:13.33,00:34:13.33,"You say not sharing the fish.>> Inviting us to dinner,"
518,00:34:15.83,00:34:15.83,"basically.>> PROBST: All right, Parvati,"
519,00:34:18.88,00:34:18.88,tell me your story.What happened?
520,00:34:20.88,00:34:20.88,">> Basically, the three of us,me, Candice, and Adam, know"
521,00:34:24.17,00:34:24.17,"we're on the outside.So they have their five, and we"
522,00:34:26.92,00:34:26.92,"have our three.And we're in the tent, you know,"
523,00:34:29.08,00:34:29.08,"just spending time with eachother, you know."
524,00:34:31.08,00:34:31.08,Apparently it pissed some peopleoff that we weren't helping
525,00:34:33.92,00:34:33.92,around camp.So Jonathan gets back and
526,00:34:37.50,00:34:37.50,decides that he doesn't want toshare his fish that he's caught.
527,00:34:40.62,00:34:40.62,">> Everybody but Jonathan, Ithink, was cool with us working"
528,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,"together.I think... I mean, haven't"
529,00:34:46.21,00:34:46.21,"talked to Jonathan, so I don'tknow what his thoughts are."
530,00:34:48.96,00:34:48.96,>> PROBST: Are you and Jonathannot speaking to each other?
531,00:34:51.83,00:34:51.83,>> I don't really care forJonathan at this point.
532,00:34:55.12,00:34:55.12,>> It's just interesting themore comfortable he gets with
533,00:34:57.04,00:34:57.04,"his position in this game, themore his true colors show, and"
534,00:35:00.62,00:35:00.62,it just shows the level ofimmaturity.
535,00:35:03.17,00:35:03.17,"I'm sorry, but I'm half his age,and I'm twice as mature as he"
536,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,is.>> I agree.
537,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,>> Now it's all starting to comeout.
538,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,I understand that you guys arehurt or disappointed or
539,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,whatever.But you have five people
540,00:35:12.54,00:35:12.54,"working, and you have threepeople who don't do any work."
541,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,At what point does the fivepeople who are working and the
542,00:35:17.88,00:35:17.88,three people who are basicallywaiting for the dinner bell so
543,00:35:20.08,00:35:20.08,"that they can get fed-- youknow, when is that not"
544,00:35:23.12,00:35:23.12,appropriate?>> I think it's an arrogance
545,00:35:25.33,00:35:25.33,"thing.""We got the numbers."
546,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,You're going down.You're on a sinking ship.
547,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,"You know, we got the food.We don't have to feed you."""
548,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"And you know, all of them havesaid that they don't like"
549,00:35:34.58,00:35:34.58,Jonathan.>> Everyone knows how you are.
550,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,It's not a secret.>> What am I?
551,00:35:39.88,00:35:39.88,>> You're a rat!I mean...
552,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,">> That's a fact, that I'm arat?"
553,00:35:42.50,00:35:42.50,I don't even know what thatmeans.
554,00:35:43.83,00:35:43.83,>> You're just...>> I'm a cancer.
555,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,I know.That's enough out of you.
556,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,>> Is that right?There's absolutely no reason for
557,00:35:48.96,00:35:48.96,"you to be around now though.>> Says you, jack-- says you."
558,00:35:52.58,00:35:52.58,"I've earned my place here today.>> Jonathan, you have."
559,00:35:55.21,00:35:55.21,"You have outwitted your place...>> Oh, come on."
