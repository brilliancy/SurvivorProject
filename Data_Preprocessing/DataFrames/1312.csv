5,00:00:07.12,00:00:07.12,>> PROBST: ...Jonathan's direction turns some people off.
6,00:00:09.42,00:00:09.42,>> Don't be coming around barking orders at me in the
7,00:00:11.88,00:00:11.88,"morning. It's like ""Shut up, fool."""
8,00:00:13.88,00:00:13.88,>> PROBST: Drop your buffs. You are merging.
9,00:00:16.67,00:00:16.67,"Raro and Aitu became one. >> Thank you, sir."

13,00:00:29.46,00:00:29.46,four felt vulnerable. >> Our backs are against the
14,00:00:32.12,00:00:32.12,wall. We need someone to flip.
15,00:00:34.25,00:00:34.25,So I think I know what would change the game.
16,00:00:36.17,00:00:36.17,>> PROBST: Yul formulated a plan...
17,00:00:37.62,00:00:37.62,>> I have the idol. >> PROBST: ...to use the hidden
18,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,immunity idol as leverage. >> I think I can use it to get
19,00:00:42.21,00:00:42.21,"Jonathan. If it works out, it could change"
20,00:00:44.25,00:00:44.25,"the course of the game. Hypothetically, say I have the"
21,00:00:45.92,00:00:45.92,idol... >> I'd have to think long and
22,00:00:47.71,00:00:47.71,hard about my reaction if you even implied that you could show
23,00:00:49.92,00:00:49.92,me the idol. >> PROBST: At the first
24,00:00:53.92,00:00:53.92,individual immunity challenge... We are down to the final two.
25,00:00:57.38,00:00:57.38,...Candice and Ozzy battled it out.
26,00:00:59.67,00:00:59.67,But in the end... Candice drops out.
27,00:01:02.25,00:01:02.25,Ozzy wins the first individual immunity.
28,00:01:05.12,00:01:05.12,You are safe in tonight's vote. After the challenge...
29,00:01:08.04,00:01:08.04,>> This is the idol. >> PROBST: ...Yul tried to seal
30,00:01:11.08,00:01:11.08,the deal with Jonathan... >> I appreciate you showing that
31,00:01:13.42,00:01:13.42,"to me. Basically, Yul said, ""Vote with"
32,00:01:15.46,00:01:15.46,"us, or you're going home tonight."""
33,00:01:17.75,00:01:17.75,>> PROBST: ...while Candice and Adam were playing their own
34,00:01:19.25,00:01:19.25,game. With tribal council looming...
35,00:01:23.12,00:01:23.12,>> Please understand I have to think about this.
36,00:01:24.75,00:01:24.75,>> PROBST: ...Jonathan was the swing vote that would make all

38,00:01:28.92,00:01:28.92,to be pissed. Either I'll have betrayed the
39,00:01:30.92,00:01:30.92,"Raro people and I'm a complete bastard, or I didn't jump over"
40,00:01:34.25,00:01:34.25,to the Aitu people and I'm a complete bastard.
41,00:01:36.75,00:01:36.75,">> PROBST: But at tribal council, when it came time for"
42,00:01:39.25,00:01:39.25,his decision... 12th person voted out and the
43,00:01:42.58,00:01:42.58,fourth member of our jury... ...Jonathan betrayed his former
44,00:01:46.00,00:01:46.00,Raro tribe and joined the Aitu four in voting out Nate.
45,00:01:49.75,00:01:49.75,"Nate, the tribe has spoken. Eight are left."
46,00:01:53.29,00:01:53.29,Who will be voted out tonight? >> All I can tell you is this.
47,00:02:10.71,00:02:10.71,You ready? If it wasn't going to be me
48,00:02:12.29,00:02:12.29,"tonight, it was going to be you. >> He was going to play the idol"
49,00:02:14.38,00:02:14.38,tonight. You know?
50,00:02:20.96,00:02:20.96,"I was not going to play that game, because the next time, the"
51,00:02:22.96,00:02:22.96,"four of them are gunning for me, and I'm in a tie-breaker"
52,00:02:24.88,00:02:24.88,situation. So I either had a 100% chance of
53,00:02:27.17,00:02:27.17,going home tonight or a 50% change of going home the next
54,00:02:29.75,00:02:29.75,time. Because I wanted to swing the
55,00:02:33.08,00:02:33.08,"vote, flip the game, I vote for Nate."
56,00:02:36.54,00:02:36.54,And the truth is that I would rather play with the Aitu
57,00:02:38.79,00:02:38.79,"people; I'd rather see them win, if I don't win."
58,00:02:41.50,00:02:41.50,"I was in the position to make that choice, and I did, and I"
59,00:02:43.58,00:02:43.58,"believe I made the right choice. >> So at tribal council, I think"
60,00:02:58.12,00:02:58.12,everyone was holding their breath.
61,00:02:59.58,00:02:59.58,"I believed Jonathan, and I believed he was sincere in"
62,00:03:02.08,00:03:02.08,"switching over, but I wasn't sure."
63,00:03:12.17,00:03:12.17,>> It was a huge risk that we took.
64,00:03:14.42,00:03:14.42,But this is how I wanted to play the idol.
65,00:03:16.38,00:03:16.38,"I wanted to play it at a point in time where it, you know,"
66,00:03:19.12,00:03:19.12,"resets the entire game in your favor, and it worked."
67,00:03:24.83,00:03:24.83,">> You pissed everyone in this game off, so I hope you're happy"
68,00:03:30.75,00:03:30.75,with second place. I just think that you played
69,00:03:35.79,00:03:35.79,"yourself out tonight, and I am so disappointed."
70,00:03:41.42,00:03:41.42,It's vile to me. It makes me... I feel sick to my
71,00:03:45.21,00:03:45.21,"stomach. After tribal, I just felt like"
72,00:03:47.88,00:03:47.88,"that nausea, and I... really, all I wanted to do was take"
73,00:03:52.12,00:03:52.12,Jonathan's face and just throw up all over it.
74,00:03:54.88,00:03:54.88,You weren't going home tonight. >> I could have been going home
75,00:03:56.46,00:03:56.46,"tonight. >> No, you couldn't have."
76,00:03:58.17,00:03:58.17,">> If I didn't throw in with them, they all would have vote"
77,00:03:59.71,00:03:59.71,for me. You all would have voted for
78,00:04:02.25,00:04:02.25,"Yul, and it would have bounced off Yul and hit me."
79,00:04:04.92,00:04:04.92,>> Not if you told us about the idol.
80,00:04:06.46,00:04:06.46,>> Yul doesn't have the idol. >> Yul does have the idol.
81,00:04:10.00,00:04:10.00,He showed me the idol. I don't know what you think
82,00:04:12.25,00:04:12.25,"you're talking about. And even my saying that, you"
83,00:04:18.25,00:04:18.25,wouldn't trust that I was telling the truth.
84,00:04:19.58,00:04:19.58,>> I don't. I absolutely don't trust a word
85,00:04:20.92,00:04:20.92,that comes out of your mouth. >> Fair enough.
86,00:04:28.08,00:04:28.08,>> I couldn't control myself. I snapped on him and told him
87,00:04:29.92,00:04:29.92,how I felt about him and called him out.
88,00:04:32.67,00:04:32.67,"And I think that he's a filthy, miserable rat."

99,00:06:27.42,00:06:27.42,would not help her in her life. It would screw her life up.

190,00:11:44.88,00:11:44.88,"know, we might as well just make sure."
191,00:11:50.04,00:11:50.04,>> Wow. >> This is it right here.
192,00:11:53.25,00:11:53.25,It's a compass on the necklace. >> Looks authentic.
193,00:11:58.50,00:11:58.50,">> PROBST: Yul, why did you want everyone to know something"
194,00:12:00.46,00:12:00.46,that's so valuable? >> I wanted to play it at a
195,00:12:04.21,00:12:04.21,"critical moment in a game. That opportunity came up, when"
196,00:12:07.29,00:12:07.29,we were down in the merge. We came in with lower numbers--
197,00:12:10.29,00:12:10.29,"four, five. We had to make someone switch,"
198,00:12:12.83,00:12:12.83,"so at that point, I felt like ""This is the right moment."
199,00:12:15.17,00:12:15.17,"If I play this right, it could change the entire ending of this"
200,00:12:17.21,00:12:17.21,"whole adventure."" And fortunately, it did."
201,00:12:20.88,00:12:20.88,">> PROBST: All right, Candice, you've given your money to"
202,00:12:22.50,00:12:22.50,Becky. Follow the path.
203,00:12:24.50,00:12:24.50,The boat will pick you up. You will return in time for the
204,00:12:27.12,00:12:27.12,next immunity challenge. >> PROBST: Ready for your next
205,00:12:37.58,00:12:37.58,item? >> Yes.
206,00:12:39.58,00:12:39.58,">> PROBST: Something else a little unusual, a never-ending"
207,00:12:43.17,00:12:43.17,ice cream maker. >> Holy...
208,00:12:45.38,00:12:45.38,">> Whoa! >> Oh, my god!"
209,00:12:47.25,00:12:47.25,">> PROBST: For as long as we are at the challenge, you can eat"
210,00:12:49.21,00:12:49.21,ice cream. >> 400.
211,00:12:51.04,00:12:51.04,">> PROBST: 400, Jonathan, everyone penny he's got."
212,00:12:53.83,00:12:53.83,">> 420. >> PROBST: 420, the magic"
213,00:12:55.83,00:12:55.83,"number, going once, twice, sold to dolphin boy."
214,00:13:01.46,00:13:01.46,( laughter ) >> Don't waste time!
215,00:13:06.25,00:13:06.25,"Don't be funny! Eat, eat!"
216,00:13:08.54,00:13:08.54,"Yeah, don't mess around. >> PROBST: Next item will remain"
217,00:13:12.12,00:13:12.12,covered. >> 160.
218,00:13:14.08,00:13:14.08,>> 180. >> 200.
219,00:13:15.54,00:13:15.54,>> 240. >> PROBST: 240 to Jonathan.
220,00:13:18.08,00:13:18.08,"Going once, going twice, sold to Jonathan."
221,00:13:23.21,00:13:23.21,">> Oh! >> Oh, it's what I like too."
222,00:13:25.12,00:13:25.12,It's got pepperoni on it. Pepperoni pizza.
223,00:13:28.58,00:13:28.58,"Oh, my favorite! And no sharing, right?"
224,00:13:36.04,00:13:36.04,"Oh, my god. >> PROBST: Next item up for bid,"
225,00:13:40.88,00:13:40.88,also covered. >> 60.
226,00:13:45.00,00:13:45.00,>> 80. >> 100.
227,00:13:46.08,00:13:46.08,>> 120. >> 140.
228,00:13:47.88,00:13:47.88,">> PROBST: 140 to Sundra. Going once, twice, sold to"
229,00:13:52.25,00:13:52.25,"Sundra, $140. Something straight from your"
230,00:13:56.25,00:13:56.25,"beach, a sea cucumber. A little something to clean up"
231,00:14:01.67,00:14:01.67,after eating. >> 100.
232,00:14:04.04,00:14:04.04,>> PROBST: And nobody interested.
233,00:14:06.21,00:14:06.21,>> PROBST: Do you have $100? >> I just bid it.
234,00:14:09.17,00:14:09.17,>> PROBST: Sold to Jonathan for 100 bucks.
235,00:14:11.62,00:14:11.62,>> Here's 100. Here's a tip for you.
236,00:14:13.83,00:14:13.83,">> PROBST: Thanks. >> Oh, man, if this is the end"
237,00:14:15.67,00:14:15.67,"of the challenge, I'm going to jump off a bridge."
238,00:14:19.83,00:14:19.83,>> PROBST: That's it. Survivor auction is over.
239,00:14:49.25,00:14:49.25,>> Jonathan cleaned up on that one.
240,00:14:51.04,00:14:51.04,>> I got a hot dog and French fries.
241,00:14:53.25,00:14:53.25,I got a pizza. >> The hard part was just
242,00:14:55.33,00:14:55.33,watching other people eat while you couldn't eat.
243,00:14:57.62,00:14:57.62,">> Of course. >> That is painful, surprisingly"
244,00:14:59.50,00:14:59.50,painful. I didn't think it would bother
245,00:15:01.29,00:15:01.29,"me, but it was actually very, very difficult."
246,00:15:04.17,00:15:04.17,">> I got to say, I'm much thirstier having ate that."
247,00:15:07.08,00:15:07.08,I don't know if it's the amount of food or just the kind of
248,00:15:09.58,00:15:09.58,food. I wouldn't eat that much food in
249,00:15:12.83,00:15:12.83,the real world. ( burps )
250,00:15:17.50,00:15:17.50,">> Oh, I definitely smell that pepperoni-- whew."
251,00:15:36.58,00:15:36.58,>> Does this make you guys want to reconsider the order?
252,00:15:40.00,00:15:40.00,"( Sundra sighing ) >> I was just like, ""Hmm, maybe"
253,00:16:02.12,00:16:02.12,"there's a little... a little resentment, a little hostility"
254,00:16:04.67,00:16:04.67,"brewing."" >> We just figured, like,"
255,00:16:07.96,00:16:07.96,today's show was very... >> Revealing.
256,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,>> ...very revealing. I think that we were all
257,00:16:12.29,00:16:12.29,surprised. >> And if he gets in the final
258,00:16:21.12,00:16:21.12,"four, I will shoot myself. Potentially, this game could get"
259,00:16:26.79,00:16:26.79,"flipped on top of its head once more-- I'm hoping, I'm praying."
260,00:16:30.08,00:16:30.08,It all hangs on other people right now.
261,00:16:33.67,00:16:33.67,So the best I can do is try to be as persuasive as I can and
262,00:16:36.38,00:16:36.38,try not to be pushy. >> I'm going to get octopus.
263,00:16:40.54,00:16:40.54,>> Okay. >> It's something that they've
264,00:16:48.42,00:16:48.42,seen. It's like just seeing the wrong
265,00:16:50.08,00:16:50.08,person get ahead. I think Jonathan was a little
266,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,too arrogant and a little too cocky at the food auction.
267,00:16:57.83,00:16:57.83,And it just shows a little bit maybe of what his true character
268,00:17:00.17,00:17:00.17,is like. >> After today and just... I
269,00:17:03.08,00:17:03.08,feel like his true personality is coming out.
270,00:17:05.04,00:17:05.04,>> I agree. >> And actually spending the
271,00:17:07.04,00:17:07.04,last few days with him also is not something I find
272,00:17:09.08,00:17:09.08,particularly pleasant. >> Is he coming?
273,00:17:15.25,00:17:15.25,>> So we were just talking about... talking with Sundra
274,00:17:16.92,00:17:16.92,about the whole order of voting people out.
275,00:17:18.38,00:17:18.38,>> Cool. Something is up.
276,00:17:21.75,00:17:21.75,"Unfortunately, I think Parvati and Adam have obviously gotten"
277,00:17:25.75,00:17:25.75,"in the girls' ear, and I just don't know to what degree that"
278,00:17:30.04,00:17:30.04,"has really worked. Clearly, the energy has shifted."
279,00:17:39.92,00:17:39.92,>> Fourth time coming out to Exile.
280,00:17:42.46,00:17:42.46,It's tough to keep coming out here over and over and over
281,00:17:45.54,00:17:45.54,"again. I really miss Adam, and it'd be"
282,00:17:49.71,00:17:49.71,"really nice, you know, just to get a hug."
283,00:17:58.33,00:17:58.33,"I think I'm next on the chopping block, and so I need this"
284,00:18:00.62,00:18:00.62,immunity. ( thunder )
285,00:18:07.50,00:18:07.50,I wish I wasn't feeling so down right now.
286,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,"Emotionally, I'm on the edge. >> ""When were we rolled in a"
287,00:18:30.25,00:18:30.25,barrel? We merged how many days ago?
288,00:18:33.83,00:18:33.83,All these key moments remembered now become crucial to know.
289,00:18:39.33,00:18:39.33,Your past will affect your future.
290,00:18:42.12,00:18:42.12,"Stay calm, but you better hurry. Take too long or things don't"
291,00:18:47.04,00:18:47.04,"add up, you might be the next on the jury."""
292,00:18:50.54,00:18:50.54,>> This challenge is very important for me personally.
293,00:18:53.08,00:18:53.08,I don't like what Jonathan stands for.
294,00:18:54.92,00:18:54.92,I don't like having Jonathan around.
295,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,"He's just a dirty, dirty rat, and I would love to get some"
296,00:19:02.08,00:19:02.08,revenge against Jonathan and continue to be in this game.
297,00:19:06.92,00:19:06.92,"So I need to win this one. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
298,00:19:24.38,00:19:24.38,"Now bring in Candice, returning from Exile Island."
299,00:19:36.46,00:19:36.46,Shall we get to today's challenge?
300,00:19:38.08,00:19:38.08,>> Sure. >> PROBST: First things first.
301,00:19:39.58,00:19:39.58,"Ozzy, why don't you take that off?"
302,00:19:46.96,00:19:46.96,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
303,00:19:50.12,00:19:50.12,"For today's challenge, you will be quizzed on how well you"
304,00:19:53.62,00:19:53.62,recollect the events of the last 30 days.
305,00:19:56.92,00:19:56.92,"On my go, you will read four questions."
306,00:19:59.67,00:19:59.67,This will give you answers in the form of numbers.
307,00:20:02.33,00:20:02.33,"You will then add, subtract, or divide the answers to come up"
308,00:20:06.04,00:20:06.04,with a final number. You'll then untie a
309,00:20:08.75,00:20:08.75,"corresponding box, searching for a key."
310,00:20:12.04,00:20:12.04,"You'll use that key to open a lock, which will raise a flag."
311,00:20:17.08,00:20:17.08,The first three to raise their flag move on to the final round.
312,00:20:21.33,00:20:21.33,"The winner of that round wins immunity, guaranteed a one-in-"
313,00:20:25.42,00:20:25.42,"seven shot at a million bucks. Losers, tribal council, somebody"
314,00:20:30.21,00:20:30.21,going home. Big enough stakes?
315,00:20:32.38,00:20:32.38,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, take your"
316,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,"spots on the start, we'll get going."
317,00:20:38.33,00:20:38.33,Here we go. First three move on to the final
318,00:20:40.17,00:20:40.17,round. Survivors ready?
319,00:20:45.17,00:20:45.17,"Go. First question, the total number"
320,00:20:49.04,00:20:49.04,of pieces used to construct the stepping stones for the fifth
321,00:20:52.67,00:20:52.67,immunity challenge used to transport tribe members from one
322,00:20:56.46,00:20:56.46,platform to the next. Take that number and add it with
323,00:21:00.92,00:21:00.92,the number of plaster boxes to be smashed by each tribe with
324,00:21:04.46,00:21:04.46,a club to retrieve keys in the challenge to win the catalog
325,00:21:07.54,00:21:07.54,"reward. Take those two numbers, subtract"
326,00:21:10.67,00:21:10.67,"the number of days since the Aitutaki Tribe mutiny, including"
327,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,"today, and subtract the number of people currently in the jury,"
328,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,and you have your number. How well do you recall what has
329,00:21:22.75,00:21:22.75,happened out here over the last month?
330,00:21:27.04,00:21:27.04,"Jonathan untying, thinks he has it."
331,00:21:29.08,00:21:29.08,"Ozzy untying. Yul now untying, thinks he has"
332,00:21:31.25,00:21:31.25,it. If you find a piece of metal
333,00:21:40.62,00:21:40.62,"that is not a key, you are wrong."
334,00:21:45.00,00:21:45.00,"Jonathan was wrong, has to start again."
335,00:21:48.00,00:21:48.00,Is Ozzy right? No.
336,00:21:52.21,00:21:52.21,"It's been a long 30 days, hard to remember everything that's"
337,00:21:54.75,00:21:54.75,"happened out here. Parvati, the first one to get it"
338,00:22:02.58,00:22:02.58,right. Parvati moving on to the final.
339,00:22:06.58,00:22:06.58,Two more people moving on to the final.
340,00:22:16.04,00:22:16.04,Candice close. Does she have a key?
341,00:22:18.71,00:22:18.71,Who's it going to be? Adam has a key.
342,00:22:22.67,00:22:22.67,Jonathan has a key. Candice has a key.
343,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,Jonathan is good. Adam is good.
344,00:22:32.08,00:22:32.08,"Candice, just a second too late. Jonathan, Adam, Parvati moving"
345,00:22:38.33,00:22:38.33,"on to the next round. For this round, you will answer"
346,00:22:42.38,00:22:42.38,more questions. You'll use the key to unlock a
347,00:22:45.46,00:22:45.46,"timber tunnel, crawl through the tunnel, over a series of"
348,00:22:48.21,00:22:48.21,"floating pontoons, and raise one final flag."
349,00:22:52.21,00:22:52.21,Winner gets immunity. Survivors ready?
350,00:22:55.88,00:22:55.88,Go. Here are the next questions: the
351,00:22:59.12,00:22:59.12,"number of immunity challenges so far, including this one, plus"
352,00:23:04.50,00:23:04.50,the number of survivors at tribal council during the lamb
353,00:23:07.88,00:23:07.88,"shank feast, divided by the number of underwater flags"
354,00:23:12.75,00:23:12.75,collected in the barrel rolling competition.
355,00:23:16.46,00:23:16.46,"Get that right, you have the number, you get the key, you win"
356,00:23:19.79,00:23:19.79,"immunity. Adam, the first to start"
357,00:23:25.46,00:23:25.46,"untying. Parvati, Jonathan, nowhere close"
358,00:23:29.08,00:23:29.08,"at this point. Adam is right, he has a big"
359,00:23:33.25,00:23:33.25,"lead. And if he's wrong, he'll have to"
360,00:23:36.04,00:23:36.04,start over. Parvati now untying.
361,00:23:39.17,00:23:39.17,"Jonathan taking his time, wanting to be right."
362,00:23:41.92,00:23:41.92,Adam already searching for that key.
363,00:23:44.17,00:23:44.17,Is he right? Adam has the key.
364,00:23:51.12,00:23:51.12,He's moving on. Jonathan untying.
365,00:23:53.38,00:23:53.38,Parvati still trying to stay in this.
366,00:23:56.71,00:23:56.71,Adam ripping through the knots. Adam starts through the tunnel.
367,00:24:07.67,00:24:07.67,Jonathan does not have it right. He's got to do his math again.
368,00:24:10.50,00:24:10.50,Adam up and over. Parvati has the key.
369,00:24:14.12,00:24:14.12,Adam untying the last knots of the timber tunnel.
370,00:24:18.17,00:24:18.17,"Jonathan, still no key. Parvati has to untie her knots."
371,00:24:27.12,00:24:27.12,"Adam, through the tunnel. One leg left, the floating"
372,00:24:29.88,00:24:29.88,pontoons. Can he make it in one go?
373,00:24:34.62,00:24:34.62,He's hanging on. >> You got it.
374,00:24:37.25,00:24:37.25,>> PROBST: Struggling to hang on.
375,00:24:38.88,00:24:38.88,Trying to crawl. And he's doing it.
376,00:24:43.67,00:24:43.67,>> Come on! >> Yeah!
377,00:24:45.75,00:24:45.75,">> PROBST: Adam first to cross, casually raises his flag."
378,00:24:51.62,00:24:51.62,( applause ) Adam wins immunity!
379,00:24:55.75,00:24:55.75,">> Nice job, Adam. >> Nice job!"
380,00:24:59.29,00:24:59.29,">> Very good job. >> PROBST: Adam, come on over."
381,00:25:10.83,00:25:10.83,Congratulations. ( applause )
382,00:25:14.71,00:25:14.71,"Adam, safe from the vote tonight."
383,00:25:16.92,00:25:16.92,But here is a fact: one of you guys is going home tonight.
384,00:25:20.25,00:25:20.25,"See you at tribal. Grab your stuff, head on back to"
385,00:25:21.79,00:25:21.79,"camp. >> Take a little one, and you"
386,00:25:39.25,00:25:39.25,pop it. >> Welcome back.
387,00:25:42.33,00:25:42.33,>> Thank you. Adam won immunity today at the
388,00:25:44.42,00:25:44.42,"challenge, so tonight we're going to tribal council, and"
389,00:25:48.12,00:25:48.12,it's looking like my number's up.
390,00:25:51.08,00:25:51.08,It's upsetting to think that Jonathan will get farther than
391,00:25:53.79,00:25:53.79,"me in this game, and that's upsetting to think that someone"
392,00:25:57.79,00:25:57.79,"that everyone feels-- everyone, even the people in his alliance"
393,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,"feel that Jonathan is a snake. >> Jonathan's just a slime ball,"
394,00:26:07.96,00:26:07.96,"and he needs to be voted off. >> I mean, I understand why you"
395,00:26:10.58,00:26:10.58,"don't like Jonathan, but how does this help you?"
396,00:26:13.21,00:26:13.21,>> I don't care. >> It doesn't help us...
397,00:26:14.67,00:26:14.67,>> I'll be at peace with myself if he's voted out before us.
398,00:26:17.58,00:26:17.58,">> Honestly, I will feel like I have won if he is voted out"
399,00:26:20.25,00:26:20.25,before I am. >> You're an upstanding guy.
400,00:26:22.17,00:26:22.17,">> He's behind you, Yul. >> Got a flounder."
401,00:26:35.08,00:26:35.08,">> Yeah, my first flounder. >> Nice."
402,00:26:40.17,00:26:40.17,">> If we can get a fire going, we can cook some fish."
403,00:26:47.08,00:26:47.08,">> Adam, Parvati, and Candice approached me today."
404,00:26:49.88,00:26:49.88,"They really want Jonathan out of the game, so they asked me, kind"
405,00:26:52.75,00:26:52.75,"of appealing to my sense of, you know, justice and integrity, to"
406,00:26:56.42,00:26:56.42,please vote him off first. Jonathan is not my first choice
407,00:26:59.79,00:26:59.79,"to kind of welcome him back. Like, he's... you know, he is"
408,00:27:03.12,00:27:03.12,what he is. >> I think you're
409,00:27:04.88,00:27:04.88,underestimating him. >> Let me finish.
410,00:27:06.38,00:27:06.38,"I understand how he thinks, right?"
411,00:27:08.00,00:27:08.00,"The guy is selfish, and he's rational, right?"
412,00:27:11.04,00:27:11.04,"So I can predict, basically, what he's going to go for."
413,00:27:14.12,00:27:14.12,"I can predict, like, what makes sense to him."
414,00:27:29.17,00:27:29.17,>> I'm not the ring leader. I mean...
415,00:27:31.12,00:27:31.12,">> Yeah, you are. >> Let me just... it's not that"
416,00:27:36.38,00:27:36.38,simple. If we change things up right
417,00:27:38.21,00:27:38.21,"now, it will have other ramifications, and you know,"
418,00:27:40.92,00:27:40.92,"obviously, I can't really talk about that stuff."
419,00:27:57.29,00:27:57.29,>> Adam was eating that. Are you taking that away?
420,00:27:59.17,00:27:59.17,">> Oh, I'm sorry. >> Yeah, what are you doing?"
421,00:28:00.42,00:28:00.42,>> I didn't realize it was your coconut.
422,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,"No, no, you eat it. >> No, I don't want it!"
423,00:28:04.62,00:28:04.62,You eat it! >> Then what's the problem?
424,00:28:08.25,00:28:08.25,"All I did was pick it up so I could share it, that's all."
425,00:28:11.08,00:28:11.08,">> Well, cut it up, eat it. >> Great, thank you."
426,00:28:14.08,00:28:14.08,>> It's not that complicated. >> I'll go get some more
427,00:28:16.92,00:28:16.92,firewood so we can make some fish.
428,00:28:26.12,00:28:26.12,Things finally came to a head. They've been percolating and
429,00:28:29.08,00:28:29.08,"brewing, a lot of silence, a lot of glares, and I'm getting a"
430,00:28:32.96,00:28:32.96,little mad. ( laughter )
431,00:28:36.17,00:28:36.17,>> You did not miss me. You have not been cuddly.
432,00:28:38.08,00:28:38.08,>> I missed you. >> And you know what?
433,00:28:40.00,00:28:40.00,You missed your last night to cuddle.
434,00:28:41.42,00:28:41.42,You missed your last cuddly chance.
435,00:28:44.75,00:28:44.75,">> I'm uncomfortable! >> Okay, come here, we'll give"
436,00:28:48.25,00:28:48.25,"you a smooch too. >> Jonathan, thank you for the"
437,00:29:11.38,00:29:11.38,fish. >> Yeah.
438,00:29:12.75,00:29:12.75,">> Thank you, Jonathan. >> You're so welcome, guys, of"
439,00:29:14.21,00:29:14.21,course. I wish it could be more.
440,00:29:23.12,00:29:23.12,>> Where'd they all go? Are they eating?
441,00:29:26.38,00:29:26.38,">> Yeah, probably. >> That is wrong."
442,00:29:30.88,00:29:30.88,"That's coming out at tribal. All right, I'll be back."
443,00:29:38.25,00:29:38.25,"( thunder ) >> What's going on, guys?"
444,00:29:46.29,00:29:46.29,">> Well, what do you mean? >> I mean, since when do you"
445,00:29:49.88,00:29:49.88,guys not share food? This is so arrogant and so rude.
446,00:29:55.29,00:29:55.29,"I can't believe this. >> Didn't you call me a... well,"
447,00:29:59.42,00:29:59.42,it doesn't matter. >> Didn't I call you a what?
448,00:30:02.12,00:30:02.12,>> I was told that I was a disgusting rat and that I should
449,00:30:05.88,00:30:05.88,be voted against tonight for whatever reason.
450,00:30:07.58,00:30:07.58,">> Well, Jonathan, you're a rat because you betrayed everybody"
451,00:30:09.33,00:30:09.33,"in this game. >> Okay, well... and yet... and"
452,00:30:13.17,00:30:13.17,yet... >> Everybody knows that you only
453,00:30:14.54,00:30:14.54,care about yourself. Yul said it this afternoon that
454,00:30:17.29,00:30:17.29,he can predict your behavior because you're selfish...
455,00:30:20.12,00:30:20.12,>> Self-interested. >> ...and that you're... so he
456,00:30:23.88,00:30:23.88,knows what you're going to do. He knows what move you're going
457,00:30:26.17,00:30:26.17,to make because you make the selfish decision.
458,00:30:28.12,00:30:28.12,">> Candice... >> And so everybody knows that,"
459,00:30:30.12,00:30:30.12,"and everybody... >> Candice, don't speak for me."
460,00:30:32.33,00:30:32.33,"I can speak for myself, all right?"
461,00:30:33.96,00:30:33.96,>> Then what did you say? >> This is not...
462,00:30:35.79,00:30:35.79,>> What did you say? >> This is not how I would...
463,00:30:37.25,00:30:37.25,">> What did you say? >> Look, I said he was a self-"
464,00:30:39.17,00:30:39.17,"interested, rational player, right?"
465,00:30:41.62,00:30:41.62,To that extent... >> You said he's selfish.
466,00:30:43.58,00:30:43.58,>> ...I have certainty as to how he's going to predict... that I
467,00:30:45.67,00:30:45.67,"can predict his behavior, because I know what's going to"
468,00:30:47.58,00:30:47.58,"like... >> And you don't like Jonathan,"
469,00:30:49.21,00:30:49.21,and you said that too. And all these people have said
470,00:30:55.12,00:30:55.12,"that, that they don't like you. >> Let's talk about this meal."
471,00:31:00.25,00:31:00.25,We all came home from that... >> Everybody has their days
472,00:31:02.92,00:31:02.92,where they lay down in the tent. >> You know what?
473,00:31:05.08,00:31:05.08,"That's bollocks, and you know it."
474,00:31:06.92,00:31:06.92,The rest of us do not choose our days to go lay down in the tent.
475,00:31:09.29,00:31:09.29,I work my ass off every single day.
476,00:31:11.50,00:31:11.50,">> Yeah, because you're trying to weasel your way in somehow."
477,00:31:14.00,00:31:14.00,">> But luckily you're not name calling, I appreciate that."
478,00:31:16.00,00:31:16.00,>> I'm not. I'm saying you're trying to
479,00:31:17.75,00:31:17.75,weasel your way in. >> How dare you...
480,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,">> ""Weasel"" is a verb in this situation."
481,00:31:22.79,00:31:22.79,>> How dare you imply... >> Weasel your way in.
482,00:31:24.79,00:31:24.79,>> Excuse me. How dare you imply that I'm
483,00:31:26.38,00:31:26.38,behaving differently today than I have for the last 30 days.
484,00:31:30.50,00:31:30.50,You cannot say that that's true. It's not true.
485,00:31:32.79,00:31:32.79,>> You know... >> You know what?
486,00:31:34.25,00:31:34.25,And I don't even want to talk about it.
487,00:31:35.92,00:31:35.92,You've said more than enough for me.
488,00:31:37.75,00:31:37.75,"Thank you. >> Oh, that's what you're"
489,00:31:52.83,00:31:52.83,"worried about, thinking they're going to be mad at you for not"
490,00:31:54.54,00:31:54.54,changing your vote? >> Do it again.
491,00:32:05.21,00:32:05.21,>> But I guess my question to you is there's three of them.
492,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,Are you going to wait until each one gets voted off to then vote
493,00:32:08.83,00:32:08.83,off Jonathan. They're basically all saying the
494,00:32:10.46,00:32:10.46,same thing. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
495,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,"the members of our jury: Brad, Rebecca, Jenny, and Nate, voted"
496,00:32:53.50,00:32:53.50,"out at the last tribal council. I'll remind you, the jury is"
497,00:33:02.25,00:33:02.25,here merely to observe. They're gathering information
498,00:33:06.08,00:33:06.08,for a million-dollar decision. Let's start with the auction.
499,00:33:12.04,00:33:12.04,"Becky, the turning point was when you sent Candice to Exile"
500,00:33:15.92,00:33:15.92,Island for the fourth time. Why Candice?
501,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,">> I think just seeing her strength and her endurance, she"
502,00:33:22.50,00:33:22.50,was probably the fiercest competitor.
503,00:33:25.00,00:33:25.00,"She was the obvious choice. >> PROBST: Candice, you return"
504,00:33:28.46,00:33:28.46,"from Exile Island, yet you still come back with a smile on your"
505,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,face. >> I'm out here because I love
506,00:33:35.00,00:33:35.00,"this game, and it's been rough, you know?"
507,00:33:37.38,00:33:37.38,There have been some low points. But like Adam always asks
508,00:33:40.46,00:33:40.46,"everybody, ""Are you still smiling?"""
509,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"And you know, I think you have to keep that spirit up or else,"
510,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,"you know, you'll collapse. >> PROBST: Ozzy, what happened"
511,00:33:49.25,00:33:49.25,when you got back to camp after the challenge?
512,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,>> I spent a good amount of time looking for firewood and trying
513,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,to get the fire going. Jonathan went out fishing.
514,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,"Candice, Parvati, and Adam just went into the tent basically and"
515,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,later on caused a huge ordeal with us five eating fish and
516,00:34:06.88,00:34:06.88,them three not eating the fish. >> Not sharing the fish.
517,00:34:11.04,00:34:11.04,>> PROBST: You say not eating the fish.
518,00:34:13.33,00:34:13.33,"You say not sharing the fish. >> Inviting us to dinner,"
519,00:34:15.83,00:34:15.83,"basically. >> PROBST: All right, Parvati,"
520,00:34:18.88,00:34:18.88,tell me your story. What happened?
521,00:34:20.88,00:34:20.88,">> Basically, the three of us, me, Candice, and Adam, know"
522,00:34:24.17,00:34:24.17,"we're on the outside. So they have their five, and we"
523,00:34:26.92,00:34:26.92,"have our three. And we're in the tent, you know,"
524,00:34:29.08,00:34:29.08,"just spending time with each other, you know."
525,00:34:31.08,00:34:31.08,Apparently it pissed some people off that we weren't helping
526,00:34:33.92,00:34:33.92,around camp. So Jonathan gets back and
527,00:34:37.50,00:34:37.50,decides that he doesn't want to share his fish that he's caught.
528,00:34:40.62,00:34:40.62,">> Everybody but Jonathan, I think, was cool with us working"
529,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,"together. I think... I mean, haven't"
530,00:34:46.21,00:34:46.21,"talked to Jonathan, so I don't know what his thoughts are."
531,00:34:48.96,00:34:48.96,>> PROBST: Are you and Jonathan not speaking to each other?
532,00:34:51.83,00:34:51.83,>> I don't really care for Jonathan at this point.
533,00:34:55.12,00:34:55.12,>> It's just interesting the more comfortable he gets with
534,00:34:57.04,00:34:57.04,"his position in this game, the more his true colors show, and"
535,00:35:00.62,00:35:00.62,it just shows the level of immaturity.
536,00:35:03.17,00:35:03.17,"I'm sorry, but I'm half his age, and I'm twice as mature as he"
537,00:35:05.50,00:35:05.50,is. >> I agree.
538,00:35:07.08,00:35:07.08,>> Now it's all starting to come out.
539,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,I understand that you guys are hurt or disappointed or
540,00:35:10.71,00:35:10.71,whatever. But you have five people
541,00:35:12.54,00:35:12.54,"working, and you have three people who don't do any work."
542,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,At what point does the five people who are working and the
543,00:35:17.88,00:35:17.88,three people who are basically waiting for the dinner bell so
544,00:35:20.08,00:35:20.08,"that they can get fed-- you know, when is that not"
545,00:35:23.12,00:35:23.12,appropriate? >> I think it's an arrogance
546,00:35:25.33,00:35:25.33,"thing. ""We got the numbers."
547,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,You're going down. You're on a sinking ship.
548,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,"You know, we got the food. We don't have to feed you."""
549,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"And you know, all of them have said that they don't like"
550,00:35:34.58,00:35:34.58,Jonathan. >> Everyone knows how you are.
551,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,It's not a secret. >> What am I?
552,00:35:39.88,00:35:39.88,>> You're a rat! I mean...
553,00:35:41.04,00:35:41.04,">> That's a fact, that I'm a rat?"
554,00:35:42.50,00:35:42.50,I don't even know what that means.
555,00:35:43.83,00:35:43.83,>> You're just... >> I'm a cancer.
556,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,I know. That's enough out of you.
557,00:35:46.83,00:35:46.83,>> Is that right? There's absolutely no reason for
558,00:35:48.96,00:35:48.96,"you to be around now though. >> Says you, jack-- says you."
559,00:35:52.58,00:35:52.58,"I've earned my place here today. >> Jonathan, you have."
560,00:35:55.21,00:35:55.21,"You have outwitted your place... >> Oh, come on."
561,00:35:57.46,00:35:57.46,>> ...to be here today. >> You're just tired of hearing
562,00:35:59.54,00:35:59.54,"the truth, man. The truth hurts, doesn't it?"
563,00:36:01.88,00:36:01.88,>> That I'm a rat and a cancer? >> Come on.
564,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,>> That's the truth? >> You are.
565,00:36:07.08,00:36:07.08,">> Okay. >> PROBST: Well, just sitting"
566,00:36:09.12,00:36:09.12,"here, it seems to me that rather than a tribe of five and a tribe"
567,00:36:11.96,00:36:11.96,"of three, there's a tribe of three, with Adam, Candice and"
568,00:36:14.83,00:36:14.83,"Parvati, a foursome with Ozzy, Sundra, Becky, and Yul, and"
569,00:36:19.21,00:36:19.21,there's Jonathan on the other. >> I would disagree.
570,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,">> PROBST: Well, you're the UN. I'm expecting the UN to come in"
571,00:36:24.29,00:36:24.29,here and make everything nice. ( laughter )
572,00:36:27.38,00:36:27.38,">> Look, I mean, obviously when we tell them things, right,"
573,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,we're going to do it in a way that's going to serve our own
574,00:36:31.46,00:36:31.46,"interest. So, you know, I wouldn't take"
575,00:36:33.38,00:36:33.38,them at their word. The way they're painting the
576,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,picture is not accurate. I'll leave it at that.
577,00:36:37.88,00:36:37.88,">> He's the puppet master, and we're all puppets in his little"
578,00:36:40.04,00:36:40.04,"play. >> Come on, what do you expect"
579,00:36:41.54,00:36:41.54,"me to do? Look, we're all here trying to"
580,00:36:42.96,00:36:42.96,win. You can't fault me for that.
581,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,>> I do not at all. I respect completely all four of
582,00:36:47.21,00:36:47.21,you. >> And I'd have a lot more
583,00:36:49.46,00:36:49.46,"respect, and so would the people on the jury, if they cut loose"
584,00:36:52.08,00:36:52.08,of their cancer that they have hooked on them.
585,00:36:54.21,00:36:54.21,>> Even if all three of us were next to go.
586,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,">> Yeah, one, two, three after that."
587,00:36:57.50,00:36:57.50,">> Boom, boom, boom, sitting ducks."
588,00:36:59.62,00:36:59.62,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Jonathan, a lot has"
589,00:37:02.58,00:37:02.58,been said tonight. You have been the hub of 90% of
590,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,it. How are you feeling right now?
591,00:37:08.25,00:37:08.25,">> I feel fine. I mean, you know, one never"
592,00:37:10.46,00:37:10.46,"wants to hear some of the names that I've been called, you know."
593,00:37:13.75,00:37:13.75,So what am I going to do? Move on with the game.
594,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"Luckily for me right now, I'm in a better position than I was"
595,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,"when I was with them. >> PROBST: Candice, what are you"
596,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,basing your vote on? What can you guys do to try and
597,00:37:24.83,00:37:24.83,"turn this? >> Jeff, we've tried everything,"
598,00:37:28.54,00:37:28.54,"but they're going to vote how they're going to vote, and maybe"
599,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,"they're going to vote with us, and maybe they're not."
600,00:37:34.08,00:37:34.08,I just wanted to say that this is a decision that the jury is
601,00:37:36.83,00:37:36.83,going to make. They need to know what's really
602,00:37:39.00,00:37:39.00,"going on around camp, because it's been kind of ugly."
603,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,">> PROBST: Okay, let's get to the vote."
604,00:37:47.42,00:37:47.42,"Adam, you have the immunity necklace."
605,00:37:49.33,00:37:49.33,Do you want to give it up? >> I'm keeping it.
606,00:37:51.25,00:37:51.25,>> PROBST: You cannot vote for Adam.
607,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,There is also the hidden immunity idol.
608,00:37:54.50,00:37:54.50,"You all know that Yul found it, but he could have given it to"
609,00:37:57.46,00:37:57.46,someone else. Whoever is in possession of the
610,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,"idol, if you need to play it tonight, you would present it to"
611,00:38:03.21,00:38:03.21,me after the vote. The person with the next highest
612,00:38:05.71,00:38:05.71,number of votes would be sent home.
613,00:38:07.96,00:38:07.96,"It is time to vote. Ozzy, you're up."
614,00:38:22.58,00:38:22.58,">> I'm not going to sacrifice myself for you, and tonight, you"
615,00:38:25.58,00:38:25.58,"showed me your true colors. >> Wow, piece of work."
616,00:38:59.58,00:38:59.58,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
617,00:39:10.71,00:39:10.71,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
618,00:39:12.25,00:39:12.25,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
619,00:39:14.21,00:39:14.21,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
620,00:39:18.04,00:39:18.04,"First vote, Jonathan. Candice."
621,00:39:23.38,00:39:23.38,"One vote Jonathan, one vote Candice."
622,00:39:26.92,00:39:26.92,"Jonathan. Two votes Jonathan, one vote"
623,00:39:30.08,00:39:30.08,Candice. Candice.
624,00:39:34.92,00:39:34.92,"Two votes Candice, two votes Jonathan."
625,00:39:39.42,00:39:39.42,"Jonathan. That's three votes Jonathan, two"
626,00:39:42.25,00:39:42.25,votes Candice. Candice.
627,00:39:47.33,00:39:47.33,"We're tied, three votes Jonathan, three votes Candice."
628,00:39:53.46,00:39:53.46,"Candice. That's four votes Candice, three"
629,00:39:56.21,00:39:56.21,votes Jonathan. 13th person vote out and the
630,00:40:05.33,00:40:05.33,"fifth member of our jury, Candice."
631,00:40:08.21,00:40:08.21,"That's five, that's enough. Unless you have the hidden"
632,00:40:09.75,00:40:09.75,"immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch."
633,00:40:33.46,00:40:33.46,"Well, the kiss is nice. Maybe if it were love, he'd have"
634,00:40:36.04,00:40:36.04,"given you the immunity necklace. Candice, the tribe has spoken."
635,00:40:43.04,00:40:43.04,">> Still smiling, guys. Have fun."
636,00:40:44.79,00:40:44.79,Love ya. >> PROBST: Time for you to go.
637,00:40:59.29,00:40:59.29,"Well, I think tonight's tribal council speaks for itself."
638,00:41:03.33,00:41:03.33,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

645,00:41:28.21,00:41:28.21,I feel like my finger's about to fall off.
646,00:41:30.04,00:41:30.04,">> That could be bad. I mean, I don't know if you can"
647,00:41:32.04,00:41:32.04,stay out here with that. >> PROBST: And Yul feels the
648,00:41:34.21,00:41:34.21,pressure. >> They're going to say anything
649,00:41:36.08,00:41:36.08,"they can, because if you fall for it, then I'm gone; they're"

652,00:41:41.79,00:41:41.79,"arranging a hit on somebody. >> Wow, what can I say?"
653,00:41:50.21,00:41:50.21,What a fabulous time I've had out here playing this game.
654,00:41:54.00,00:41:54.00,I think I can look myself in the mirror and be comfortable with
655,00:41:57.25,00:41:57.25,"the way I played this game, definitely."
656,00:42:00.12,00:42:00.12,"That little kiss with Adam, it was a nice way to leave."
657,00:42:02.83,00:42:02.83,"We were partners through this, and it was sincere."
