437,00:27:23.38,00:27:23.38,"I have the immunity idol, butI'm still a target, because they"
438,00:27:26.50,00:27:26.50,know it's in my possession.So my game right now is biding
439,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,"my time and, uh, looking for thelittle cracks in their alliance"
440,00:27:33.92,00:27:33.92,that we can use to save ournecks.

444,00:27:49.62,00:27:49.62,>> ...on Tom and Colby...>> Mm-hmm.
445,00:27:51.67,00:27:51.67,>> ...and Tom plays the idol...>> Uh-huh.
446,00:27:53.62,00:27:53.62,>> ...Colby goes home becausehe's the one with the next most.
447,00:27:55.62,00:27:55.62,"Okay?If Tom doesn't play the idol,"
448,00:27:57.88,00:27:57.88,that would force a tie betweenthe two of them.
449,00:28:00.17,00:28:00.17,Then the rest of us vote four onone and two on the other...
450,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,">> So, let me just get thisstraight-- tie-breaker."
451,00:28:06.08,00:28:06.08,And they can't vote at all.>> And they can't vote at all.
452,00:28:08.12,00:28:08.12,">> Oh, so we're good.>> So, if he plays the idol,"
453,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,"then, yeah.>> So either way, we're good."
454,00:28:12.21,00:28:12.21,>> Right.We're going to Tribal Council
455,00:28:14.21,00:28:14.21,"tonight, and we kind of have aplan of what we want to do."
456,00:28:16.67,00:28:16.67,"Tom has the idol, and we needto be extra careful right now."
457,00:28:21.21,00:28:21.21,"But as long as we're all on thesame page, yeah, theoretically,"
458,00:28:25.00,00:28:25.00,"it should work out.>> Yeah, but he's not going to"
459,00:28:40.29,00:28:40.29,hurt us.>> It just scares me because
460,00:28:42.29,00:28:42.29,"Tom's smart, you know?>> I'm just telling you, I"
461,00:28:44.29,00:28:44.29,trust him a hell of a lot morethan I trust Candice.
462,00:28:47.04,00:28:47.04,"I would love to have Tom andhis idol in alliance with me,"
463,00:28:50.96,00:28:50.96,no doubt.Tom and Colby are both
464,00:28:52.96,00:28:52.96,shoot-you-straight kind ofguys.
465,00:28:55.04,00:28:55.04,"They look you in the eye, shakeyour hand, tell you how they"
466,00:28:57.21,00:28:57.21,"feel, and you can take it to thebank."
467,00:28:59.12,00:28:59.12,">> Hey, there.>> But I'd rather have someone"
468,00:29:01.21,00:29:01.21,like that I can count on thanCandice.
469,00:29:03.21,00:29:03.21,"The scrambling, the runningaround she's done the past"
470,00:29:05.21,00:29:05.21,couple of days.I don't trust her as far as I
471,00:29:07.21,00:29:07.21,can throw her.>> So I'm trying to figure out
472,00:29:09.75,00:29:09.75,what makes sense to you and youand James.
473,00:29:12.17,00:29:12.17,"And Colby and I, as partners,definitely makes more sense."
474,00:29:15.04,00:29:15.04,"I think you have two guys whoare going to be honest, and two"
475,00:29:18.12,00:29:18.12,guys who are going to competebetter than Cirie and Candice.
476,00:29:21.08,00:29:21.08,>> Mm-hmm.>> My concern is that because
477,00:29:24.58,00:29:24.58,"there is an immunity idol...I wish there wasn't one, and"
478,00:29:27.17,00:29:27.17,I'm trying to figure out how toget that stain off of me.
479,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,>> Why don't you just give meyour word that immunity idol's
480,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,not going to be used against usor something.
481,00:29:34.21,00:29:34.21,">> Oh, no, no.I swear to God, we'll play that"
482,00:29:38.04,00:29:38.04,"thing as a committee.If there was no idol, I'd feel"
483,00:29:40.50,00:29:40.50,much better about this.The idol is scaring me.
484,00:29:43.00,00:29:43.00,"I can give it to you if one ofyou wants it, and then it's your"
485,00:29:46.08,00:29:46.08,idol.>> With Tom having the immunity
486,00:29:48.83,00:29:48.83,"idol, he's either a big threat,or someone  great to work with."
487,00:29:53.38,00:29:53.38,"I'm a little leery of him,because Tom has voted for me in"
488,00:29:56.08,00:29:56.08,"Tribal Council, but he was readyto give us the idol, and there's"
489,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,a part of him that I really dothink is honest.
490,00:30:05.79,00:30:05.79,>> We were just talking aboutthat.
491,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,">> I don't really trust Candice.>> I like her, but she's too"
492,00:30:13.21,00:30:13.21,"scatter-brained.>> I mean, I just want to win."
493,00:30:15.25,00:30:15.25,"I just want the strongest team.>> I want to win, too."
494,00:30:17.21,00:30:17.21,">> That's what I want, too.I am totally trusting you here,"
495,00:30:19.21,00:30:19.21,Tom.>> Okay. Come here.
496,00:30:21.21,00:30:21.21,"You know, I've been trying toingratiate myself with the"
497,00:30:23.21,00:30:23.21,"powers that be, and I had alittle something to bring to the"
498,00:30:25.79,00:30:25.79,"table at this point, so asupposed new alliance was born,"
499,00:30:29.38,00:30:29.38,"but I don't believe or trustanybody in this game, so we'll"
500,00:30:31.38,00:30:31.38,see.>> Mm-hmm.
501,00:30:43.42,00:30:43.42,">> He's, like, ""Well, I don'teven want this thing."
502,00:30:45.46,00:30:45.46,I just want to be here.I'll even give it to one of you
503,00:30:47.46,00:30:47.46,"guys..."">> Mm-hmm."
504,00:30:52.29,00:30:52.29,>> That is the dumbest thing.Did he give it to you?
505,00:30:56.96,00:30:56.96,>> Amanda.These are the same people that
506,00:30:59.79,00:30:59.79,wanted you gone desperately.>> I know.
507,00:31:01.88,00:31:01.88,>> Desperately.And now you're going to save
508,00:31:04.08,00:31:04.08,them?This is so stupid.
509,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,"Tom and Colby, and they're amuch bigger threat than she is."
510,00:31:11.29,00:31:11.29,"Can you beat them?Oh, my God!"
511,00:31:16.21,00:31:16.21,"Amanda-- I love her to death,but she is not the sharpest tool"
512,00:31:20.12,00:31:20.12,in the shed.My alliance-- they're so
513,00:31:22.67,00:31:22.67,"wishy-washy.Like, these people, like, panic"
514,00:31:25.12,00:31:25.12,and do crazy stuff.Why didn't you tell me the plan
515,00:31:28.21,00:31:28.21,was changing?Unbelievable! Unbelievable!
516,00:31:34.88,00:31:34.88,"If she was so untrustworthy,your girl right here wouldn't"
517,00:31:37.67,00:31:37.67,"be standing here now.With this one, at least we can"
518,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,"keep her under control.>> Well, no."
519,00:31:42.12,00:31:42.12,"We haven't made up the finaldecision yet, though, babe."
520,00:31:44.46,00:31:44.46,>> I know.Come on.
521,00:31:46.46,00:31:46.46,Tom is very charismatic.He's very athletic.
522,00:31:49.75,00:31:49.75,He's already won this game oncebefore.
523,00:31:52.96,00:31:52.96,Why keep someone like that inthe game?
524,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,It makes no sense. It's crazy.>> Cirie is right.
525,00:32:06.58,00:32:06.58,"Amanda wants to do it, butCirie's talking the rest out"
526,00:32:08.50,00:32:08.50,"of it.At this point, you need to get"
527,00:32:12.12,00:32:12.12,"your idol out, get it, because Iain't got any control any more."
528,00:32:15.79,00:32:15.79,Cirie's the mastermind behindthis whole deal.
529,00:32:18.79,00:32:18.79,>> You know what?I thought that we had this thing
530,00:32:20.96,00:32:20.96,solid this afternoon.Amanda-- after she talked to
531,00:32:23.04,00:32:23.04,"Cirie-- she broke faith, andthis deal was off."
532,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,"Cirie's the puppet master, andshe's got her arm jammed up"
533,00:32:30.29,00:32:30.29,"there, so it could be the endof us."
534,00:32:41.88,00:32:41.88,">> They're going to vote threefor me, three for you."
535,00:32:53.04,00:32:53.04,>> There you go.>> I've got to make a big
536,00:32:59.04,00:32:59.04,"decision, a very big decision.I've seen Cirie operate."
537,00:33:03.12,00:33:03.12,I know how she plays.And it won't be long before she
538,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,gets rid of someone like me.>> I think we do three and three
539,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,to keep Candice in and keep oursix strong.
540,00:33:11.12,00:33:11.12,Yes?>> Yep.
541,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,>> All right.>> And we're not going to
542,00:33:14.42,00:33:14.42,discuss it no more.>> My gut's telling me to just
543,00:33:16.75,00:33:16.75,"go with the flow, write Colby'sname down, and don't piss"
544,00:33:20.00,00:33:20.00,"everybody off, and my heart saysI'm going to keep the good guys"
545,00:33:23.42,00:33:23.42,"in the game and get rid ofCirie, but you listen to your"
546,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,"heart, you get hurt out here, soit's all up to me."
547,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,"I know where everybody over hereis voting, except me."

549,00:33:59.83,00:33:59.83,"voted out Steph, which seemed alittle surprising, given that"
550,00:34:03.21,00:34:03.21,you've lost now three out offour immunity challenges.
551,00:34:06.58,00:34:06.58,"So, Tom, where is the philosophyof the tribe in terms of voting"
552,00:34:10.21,00:34:10.21,people out?>> Stephenie was on the wrong
553,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,side of the numbers formed onday one.

556,00:34:22.29,00:34:22.29,is it inevitable that greatpeople are going to go home
557,00:34:25.08,00:34:25.08,early merely because they're onthe wrong side of the numbers?
