4,00:00:07.88,00:00:07.88,"By day six, the Heroes had lost two challenges and were beaten"
5,00:00:11.29,00:00:11.29,and demoralized. >> If we don't become a cohesive
6,00:00:14.96,00:00:14.96,"team, we will continue to lose. >> PROBST: Things were so bad"
7,00:00:18.92,00:00:18.92,that some of the Heroes started to behave like villains.
8,00:00:22.21,00:00:22.21,James bullied the tribe. >> One voice.
9,00:00:24.17,00:00:24.17,That's all I ask. Then I get people telling
10,00:00:26.17,00:00:26.17,everybody they're wrong. >> PROBST: And J.T. was equally
11,00:00:28.25,00:00:28.25,villainous. >> I'm going to form alliances
12,00:00:30.08,00:00:30.08,with everyone I can. My strategy is to keep everyone
13,00:00:32.62,00:00:32.62,"on my side, man. >> PROBST: He made conflicting"
14,00:00:34.58,00:00:34.58,"deals with both James and Tom. At the Villains' camp, Rob's"
15,00:00:41.46,00:00:41.46,heroic actions made him the de facto tribe leader.
16,00:00:44.54,00:00:44.54,">> You are the man, and it's like, when you're talking, I'm"
17,00:00:46.67,00:00:46.67,just hanging on every word. >> I appreciate it.
18,00:00:48.29,00:00:48.29,">> Rob thinks he's the boss of the camp, but this is my"
19,00:00:51.04,00:00:51.04,mountain and I'm still the king of the hill.
20,00:00:53.83,00:00:53.83,>> PROBST: Russell got fed up with his tribe following Rob and
21,00:00:56.83,00:00:56.83,staged a rebellion by hiding the machete.
22,00:00:59.12,00:00:59.12,>> Getting rid of the machete will cause conflict in this
23,00:01:02.04,00:01:02.04,"camp, and that's a good thing. >> PROBST: Go!"
24,00:01:04.62,00:01:04.62,">> Tom, get him! >> Yeah!"
25,00:01:06.50,00:01:06.50,"Go, go! >> PROBST: But at the last"
26,00:01:08.08,00:01:08.08,"immunity challenge, everything changed."
27,00:01:10.62,00:01:10.62,Heroes win! The Heroes destroyed the
28,00:01:12.83,00:01:12.83,"Villains in a huge blowout. In addition to immunity, you"
29,00:01:16.12,00:01:16.12,"have coffee, sugar. >> Yes!"
30,00:01:19.21,00:01:19.21,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Sandra called out Coach for"
31,00:01:22.04,00:01:22.04,"being lazy. >> Coach'll delegate, ""You do"
32,00:01:24.04,00:01:24.04,"this and I'll do this and we'll go do that,"" but then when you"
33,00:01:26.75,00:01:26.75,"look, Coach is gone two miles out."
34,00:01:29.25,00:01:29.25,">> PROBST: But in the end, the entire tribe voted out their"
35,00:01:31.75,00:01:31.75,"oldest and most abrasive member. Randy, the tribe has spoken."
36,00:01:35.33,00:01:35.33,"Now, if the Villains can't get their act together, the Heroes"
37,00:01:38.38,00:01:38.38,will even the score. 17 are left.
38,00:01:41.08,00:01:41.08,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Sandra tried to call me out
39,00:01:59.33,00:01:59.33,"in Tribal tonight, and it was just very disheartening."
40,00:02:02.38,00:02:02.38,"I'm human, I'm sensitive. I'm probably more sensitive"
41,00:02:05.42,00:02:05.42,than most people. I just hide it behind a lot of
42,00:02:08.25,00:02:08.25,things that I've done and accomplished and behind a lot of
43,00:02:11.12,00:02:11.12,machismo. What did I do to deserve Sandra
44,00:02:15.42,00:02:15.42,saying that tonight? There's never been somebody like
45,00:02:18.29,00:02:18.29,me out here and there's never going to be anybody like me
46,00:02:20.08,00:02:20.08,"again. All of this, man, I don't need"
47,00:02:24.17,00:02:24.17,"it. I'm ... the man, and I don't"
48,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,need anybody to tell me or validate that.
49,00:02:30.08,00:02:30.08,I'm the only person out here that will not ... compromise.
50,00:02:35.96,00:02:35.96,(Coach clears throat) >> I understand where you're
51,00:02:39.12,00:02:39.12,"coming from, dude. >> It's unbelievable, man."
52,00:02:48.21,00:02:48.21,Why doesn't anybody ever say anything good about me?
53,00:02:50.83,00:02:50.83,"Am I that bad of a person, man? Nobody ever does, man."
54,00:02:56.08,00:02:56.08,"I'm sensitive. >> Coach, I know you're"
55,00:02:57.71,00:02:57.71,"sensitive, dude. >> But, dude..."
56,00:03:09.21,00:03:09.21,">> If you want to stick it out, I'll help you through it."
57,00:03:12.96,00:03:12.96,">> Thanks for coming out here, man."
58,00:03:15.00,00:03:15.00,">> No problem, dude. Just let me know how I can help."
59,00:03:23.75,00:03:23.75,I promise you. >> Like what?
60,00:03:26.75,00:03:26.75,>> Don't wear feathers in your hair at Tribal.
61,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17,Don't tell your stories. People don't believe your
62,00:03:32.08,00:03:32.08,stories. They mock you.
63,00:03:33.79,00:03:33.79,There's no reason to tell them. And do your tai chi in private
64,00:03:36.71,00:03:36.71,where nobody can see you. >> Coach pulled me aside and
65,00:03:43.88,00:03:43.88,"said he wanted to go home, but the Villains do need Coach in"
66,00:03:46.71,00:03:46.71,"the game. I mean, he's, he's much, much"
67,00:03:49.12,00:03:49.12,"stronger than the last time he played physically, and that's"
68,00:03:52.88,00:03:52.88,"what we need right now. >> I'm telling you, dude, I"
69,00:03:55.04,00:03:55.04,don't care what anybody says. >> When we got back from Tribal
70,00:04:23.58,00:04:23.58,"Council, Coach broke down in tears and said he didn't think"
71,00:04:26.42,00:04:26.42,"the game deserved his nobility, and he wanted to quit the game,"
72,00:04:30.12,00:04:30.12,so I told him to stick in there and he knew what he was getting
73,00:04:32.96,00:04:32.96,into. It's not like any of us are
74,00:04:36.12,00:04:36.12,"Survivor virgins. >> Is he okay, Tyson?"
75,00:04:38.92,00:04:38.92,>> He's sad. He talked to me last night and
76,00:04:41.17,00:04:41.17,said he was really thinking about just going home.
77,00:04:43.25,00:04:43.25,>> Really? >> Yeah.
78,00:04:45.21,00:04:45.21,"He cried. He was, like, sobbing."
79,00:04:49.08,00:04:49.08,>> I can't believe that. This morning has been a little
80,00:04:52.38,00:04:52.38,bit of an attitude shift. Coach had a little sob session
81,00:04:55.79,00:04:55.79,"with Tyson, wanted to quit the game or something."
82,00:04:58.33,00:04:58.33,"I don't know. That's not much of a coach, if"
83,00:05:00.75,00:05:00.75,"you ask me. What was that all about, man?"
84,00:05:05.71,00:05:05.71,>> It's just I feel like I'm on the outside.
85,00:05:08.25,00:05:08.25,"I want to bond with you, but I feel like you started playing"
86,00:05:10.21,00:05:10.21,the game... >> I'm gonna tell you something
87,00:05:11.75,00:05:11.75,right now. You're not on the outside.
88,00:05:14.12,00:05:14.12,Okay? I'm gonna tell you that.
89,00:05:17.54,00:05:17.54,"We're good. Look it, it's going to be okay,"
90,00:05:20.17,00:05:20.17,"for real, man. Come here."
91,00:05:21.96,00:05:21.96,I know you're hurting. It's all right.
92,00:05:23.33,00:05:23.33,">> I want-- I mean, I, like, want to, like, sharpen each"
93,00:05:25.25,00:05:25.25,"other out here. I want to, like, do stuff"
94,00:05:26.75,00:05:26.75,together. >> Then you're going to have to
95,00:05:28.62,00:05:28.62,"trust me. Like, literally trust me, and"
96,00:05:30.79,00:05:30.79,you're going to be fine. All right?
97,00:05:32.42,00:05:32.42,">> But I feel like the only time you, like, want to bond with me"
98,00:05:34.58,00:05:34.58,"is when we're getting up for the challenges, which is cool, and"
99,00:05:37.58,00:05:37.58,if that's all you want... >> I'm not gonna say anymore.
100,00:05:39.92,00:05:39.92,I'm gonna say you have to trust me.
101,00:05:42.21,00:05:42.21,"And it's all about this island, all right, so don't worry about"
102,00:05:44.46,00:05:44.46,"it. Don't sweat it, man, and pick"
103,00:05:46.96,00:05:46.96,"your ... head up and act like a man, for real."
104,00:05:49.88,00:05:49.88,All right? >> All right.
105,00:05:54.58,00:05:54.58,I'm different than most people. I'm one of a kind.
106,00:05:59.42,00:05:59.42,"The last of the Mohicans, King Arthur-- a legend."
107,00:06:05.21,00:06:05.21,Nobody out here has got what I have.
108,00:06:09.25,00:06:09.25,Confucius says that the greatest glory a man can have is not in
109,00:06:12.79,00:06:12.79,"never falling but in rising again every time he falls, and I"
110,00:06:16.58,00:06:16.58,fell hard last night. You got to be weak to be strong.
111,00:06:21.88,00:06:21.88,"There's power in weakness. Today's challenge, you'll see an"
112,00:06:26.42,00:06:26.42,even fiercer warrior from me. >> Yay!
113,00:06:38.96,00:06:38.96,>> All right. >> Whoo!
114,00:06:41.04,00:06:41.04,">> Read it, read it. >> ""Choose from this mountain"

120,00:06:53.17,00:06:53.17,">> ""Sears: Life. Well Spent."" >> Oh, my God."
121,00:06:57.21,00:06:57.21,">> Yeah, I love that. >> Yes!"
122,00:06:59.17,00:06:59.17,>> What does it say-- how many we can pick?
123,00:07:01.00,00:07:01.00,>> Two items. >> Fishing kit.
124,00:07:03.25,00:07:03.25,>> Oh! >> Yes!
125,00:07:05.71,00:07:05.71,>> We kind of proved at the last challenge that we're serious
126,00:07:08.62,00:07:08.62,"about this now and we're more united, and I think it's changed"
127,00:07:12.04,00:07:12.04,us as a tribe. So if the Villains walk away
128,00:07:15.54,00:07:15.54,"with this Sears stuff, I'm going to be mad because I don't want"
129,00:07:19.12,00:07:19.12,"to lose momentum. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"

191,00:11:23.67,00:11:23.67,"reward. >> Come on, Sandra!"
192,00:11:25.79,00:11:25.79,>> PROBST: Survivors ready? >> No pressure.
193,00:11:27.79,00:11:27.79,">> PROBST: Go! James, no trouble, grabs the"
194,00:11:33.96,00:11:33.96,"ball, keeps going, up on his feet like he's done it before."
195,00:11:37.75,00:11:37.75,Sandra crawling her way to number five.
196,00:11:42.17,00:11:42.17,"James scores for the Heroes! Villains lead, three-two."

200,00:11:57.83,00:11:57.83,win. You're going for number one.
201,00:12:01.25,00:12:01.25,Survivors ready? Go!
202,00:12:07.08,00:12:07.08,"Danielle not messing around, launches herself."
203,00:12:10.12,00:12:10.12,Has her ball first. Rupert loses his.
204,00:12:13.17,00:12:13.17,Rupert playing with a broken toe.
205,00:12:15.83,00:12:15.83,Danielle drops her ball now. Everybody panicking.
206,00:12:20.17,00:12:20.17,Big reward on the line. Both tribes want it.
207,00:12:25.96,00:12:25.96,Rupert must score to keep the Heroes in it.
208,00:12:28.21,00:12:28.21,">> Come on, Rupert, take your time."
209,00:12:30.21,00:12:30.21,>> PROBST: Danielle can win it for the Villains.
210,00:12:33.08,00:12:33.08,(frustrated shouts) The Villains can smell that
211,00:12:36.00,00:12:36.00,reward. Rupert scores for the Heroes!
212,00:12:40.08,00:12:40.08,"We are tied, three-three. (Rupert yells)"
213,00:12:43.04,00:12:43.04,It's going to come down to one last point.
214,00:12:46.17,00:12:46.17,Last match-up of this challenge will be Colby for the Heroes
215,00:12:50.21,00:12:50.21,taking on Tyson for the Villains.
216,00:12:53.25,00:12:53.25,Winner wins reward for their tribe.
217,00:12:56.62,00:12:56.62,You're going for number ten. Survivors ready?
218,00:13:04.12,00:13:04.12,Go! Donaldson has his ball.
219,00:13:12.21,00:13:12.21,Tyson right behind. Tyson has his ball.
220,00:13:16.46,00:13:16.46,Donaldson gets off the first shot.
221,00:13:20.12,00:13:20.12,Just misses. Tyson... just misses.
222,00:13:24.38,00:13:24.38,">> Come on, Tyson, you got it! >> Come on, Tyson!"

226,00:13:39.17,00:13:39.17,Villains! Villains win reward!
227,00:13:47.50,00:13:47.50,"All right, Heroes, I got nothing for you."
228,00:13:49.54,00:13:49.54,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
229,00:13:53.08,00:13:53.08,"Congratulations, Villains. Come grab your reward."
230,00:13:56.33,00:13:56.33,>> Sears! (whoops)
231,00:14:11.04,00:14:11.04,>> Good work. >> All right!
232,00:14:13.04,00:14:13.04,">> Well done. The challenge was great, and the"
233,00:14:18.12,00:14:18.12,dragon slayer's feeling top- notch.
234,00:14:21.21,00:14:21.21,"I'm ready to rock and roll, and I'm ready to move forward."
235,00:14:23.71,00:14:23.71,Will I change? No. Will I be the dragon slayer
236,00:14:25.96,00:14:25.96,and slay everybody? Yes. Will I wear my heart on my
237,00:14:28.33,00:14:28.33,"sleeve every day? Absolutely, unequivocably, yes."
238,00:14:31.71,00:14:31.71,">> Nice. >> I open the tools, I grab this"
239,00:14:40.00,00:14:40.00,"serrated blade, and I notice something in it immediately."
240,00:14:44.75,00:14:44.75,(indistinct chatter) >> A little note here in this.
241,00:14:53.50,00:14:53.50,>> Uh-oh. >> There you go.
242,00:14:55.62,00:14:55.62,>> Woops. >> I thought that it was
243,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,something that holds the blade in place.
244,00:15:00.12,00:15:00.12,"I wasn't thinking. And I'm like, man!"
245,00:15:03.38,00:15:03.38,"I just blew it! >> ""An immunity idol is hidden"
246,00:15:06.92,00:15:06.92,"at your camp, and you have found the clue."
247,00:15:10.25,00:15:10.25,Head down to the beach to a crazy palm which juts out over
248,00:15:14.79,00:15:14.79,the sea. Go just beyond it and to the
249,00:15:18.08,00:15:18.08,"right and dig around the roots of the double tree."""
250,00:15:21.00,00:15:21.00,>> So I grabbed the note. Little did I know it was a
251,00:15:23.21,00:15:23.21,clue to a hidden immunity idol. Who knew?
252,00:15:25.50,00:15:25.50,There were never any hidden immunity idols when I played
253,00:15:27.46,00:15:27.46,the game. What do you guys want to do?
254,00:15:31.04,00:15:31.04,We can all go find it and then do what with it?
255,00:15:38.58,00:15:38.58,">> If you get it, we're going to write your name down so that"
256,00:15:41.46,00:15:41.46,we force you to use it. It's not fair for one person to
257,00:15:44.96,00:15:44.96,have an immunity idol. >> Rob says we're finding the
258,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,hidden immunity idol all together and we'll get rid of
259,00:15:52.88,00:15:52.88,"it, but they're too dumb to walk even down the beach."
260,00:15:56.17,00:15:56.17,This is a bunch of idiots out here!
261,00:15:58.96,00:15:58.96,"Man, if I could find that hidden immunity idol, I will"
262,00:16:02.12,00:16:02.12,become powerful in this game. >> Could you guys give me a
263,00:16:05.83,00:16:05.83,"little help here? We got to clean all of this, and"
264,00:16:08.21,00:16:08.21,we have to make a floor. >> Okay.
265,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,">> And then we can take a piece of wood and push it out, so"
266,00:16:13.25,00:16:13.25,it's more of a shelter. >> Yep.
267,00:16:15.46,00:16:15.46,>> There's no way that I can get a clue for the hidden
268,00:16:18.08,00:16:18.08,immunity idol and not find it. That's not going to happen.
269,00:16:20.96,00:16:20.96,"So I'm thinking that that's the palm over the water, and they"
270,00:16:26.25,00:16:26.25,"have two trees right next to it, so I'm going to find it."
271,00:16:35.92,00:16:35.92,">> Okay. >> The question is, is he"
272,00:16:43.96,00:16:43.96,"really going for a walk, or is he going looking for the idol?"
273,00:17:34.04,00:17:34.04,">> I mean, it sucks, but that's what we said, right?"
274,00:17:40.04,00:17:40.04,">> That's what we said. We said, if you go for it, then"
275,00:17:43.12,00:17:43.12,you seal your own fate. >> Exactly.
276,00:17:45.25,00:17:45.25,>> Russell's a bonehead. He's like the hobbit on crack.
277,00:17:49.08,00:17:49.08,And you know what? I don't trust Russell's ass at
278,00:17:52.08,00:17:52.08,all. And the safest thing to do with
279,00:17:54.29,00:17:54.29,someone like that is to just get rid of him right away.
280,00:18:16.12,00:18:16.12,">> Oh, me, too, by far. Everybody slept pretty sound"
281,00:18:19.12,00:18:19.12,"last night. You can put a little more,"
282,00:18:26.08,00:18:26.08,"maybe. >> 'Cause it was kind of weak,"
283,00:18:28.00,00:18:28.00,wasn't it? >> Mm-hmm.
284,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17,>> Oh. >> Hmm.
285,00:18:37.21,00:18:37.21,">> I wonder what this is? >> I don't know, but hurry up"
286,00:18:39.75,00:18:39.75,"and open it. >> Oh, ""An immunity idol is"
287,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,hidden at your camp... and you have found the clue.
288,00:18:47.12,00:18:47.12,"At the end of your beach, you'll find the right angle."
289,00:18:50.67,00:18:50.67,In a clearing are three sections of a tree.
290,00:18:54.00,00:18:54.00,"One tall, one fallen, and one on the ground."
291,00:18:56.79,00:18:56.79,"Dig under the rock beneath the 90 degrees."""
292,00:19:02.83,00:19:02.83,(Tom laughs) Think one of us was supposed to
293,00:19:05.04,00:19:05.04,find this and not all of us? (laughter)
294,00:19:07.00,00:19:07.00,>> For real! >> This morning everything
295,00:19:10.21,00:19:10.21,"changed. As we poured out the coffee, we"
296,00:19:12.46,00:19:12.46,found a clue to a hidden immunity idol somewhere on our
297,00:19:14.79,00:19:14.79,beach. Colby and I are on the outs
298,00:19:18.12,00:19:18.12,"with this tribe with no way to get in, so we need this to stay"
299,00:19:21.79,00:19:21.79,alive in this game. >> There went J.T.
300,00:19:34.12,00:19:34.12,>> Hmm. (laughs)
301,00:19:41.50,00:19:41.50,>> I think I'll go this way. >> Damn!
302,00:20:02.71,00:20:02.71,>> We searched the first clearing.
303,00:20:05.17,00:20:05.17,"I moved to the next one, immediately saw a leaning tree,"
304,00:20:08.29,00:20:08.29,"a fallen tree, an upstanding tree, forming a triangle."
305,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,"Everybody was going to see it, I felt, so I had to get down"
306,00:20:14.38,00:20:14.38,and try to get it first. James arrived.
307,00:20:19.88,00:20:19.88,"I moved to a different spot, 'cause I could see that the sand"
308,00:20:22.50,00:20:22.50,was a little loose. I knew I was on it.
309,00:20:24.58,00:20:24.58,"So I dug quickly. And while nobody was looking,"
310,00:20:29.17,00:20:29.17,"I found the immunity idol, dropped it into my sock."
311,00:20:33.08,00:20:33.08,"Now, a few more people are on the scene."
312,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,"We got... Candice is over there. It's getting a little crowded,"
313,00:20:38.00,00:20:38.00,and I have no idea what to do with this thing.
314,00:20:44.58,00:20:44.58,">> Tom, he was acting a little funny, and when I came up on"
315,00:20:47.67,00:20:47.67,"him, I saw him put something into his sock, and then he went"
316,00:20:50.17,00:20:50.17,behind a tree. So I knew he had it.
317,00:20:55.17,00:20:55.17,">> Like, there's a lot of rocks under here."
318,00:21:00.71,00:21:00.71,">> Tom has it. >> Aw, shucks."
319,00:21:05.62,00:21:05.62,">> You know, we were getting along so good."
320,00:21:07.67,00:21:07.67,Now this is going to make everybody crazy again.
321,00:21:13.04,00:21:13.04,>> She did? All right. >> The hidden immunity idol
322,00:21:20.12,00:21:20.12,"changed the whole playing field, and that's all we needed."
323,00:21:22.50,00:21:22.50,We needed an opening. Tom and I needed an opening to
324,00:21:24.88,00:21:24.88,"get back in this game. Granted, neither Tom nor"
325,00:21:28.75,00:21:28.75,"myself, we're not comfortable. But we're in a little bit"
326,00:21:31.12,00:21:31.12,better of a position than we were a couple of days ago.
327,00:21:36.33,00:21:36.33,">> Yeah, right, what a morning. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
328,00:22:02.12,00:22:02.12,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?"
329,00:22:05.96,00:22:05.96,">> Let's do it. >> PROBST: First things first,"
330,00:22:08.00,00:22:08.00,J.T. Give it up.
331,00:22:12.04,00:22:12.04,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
332,00:22:16.08,00:22:16.08,"For today's challenge, one person will be strapped inside a"
333,00:22:18.58,00:22:18.58,giant ball. That person must then guide two
334,00:22:22.88,00:22:22.88,"other tribe members, who will be blindfolded, as they push the"
335,00:22:26.25,00:22:26.25,"ball down a long, winding course to a table maze."
336,00:22:30.67,00:22:30.67,The person inside the ball must then guide four other tribe
337,00:22:34.00,00:22:34.00,"members, also blindfolded, as they maneuver the ball through"
338,00:22:37.50,00:22:37.50,the table maze to the finish hole.
339,00:22:39.96,00:22:39.96,"First tribe to finish wins immunity, lives to see another"
340,00:22:43.38,00:22:43.38,day. Losers go to Tribal Council.
341,00:22:47.46,00:22:47.46,"Somebody will be voted out. This entire season, we've been"
342,00:22:50.96,00:22:50.96,doing classic challenges from past seasons of Survivor.
343,00:22:55.08,00:22:55.08,This challenge is classic for another reason.
344,00:22:57.75,00:22:57.75,This is the only challenge in the history of Survivor to not
345,00:23:01.46,00:23:01.46,be completed. It was stopped last season due
346,00:23:03.83,00:23:03.83,to a medical emergency. So although Russell has run
347,00:23:07.00,00:23:07.00,"this challenge, one of these two tribes will get the honor and"
348,00:23:10.04,00:23:10.04,distinction of being the first tribe to win it.
349,00:23:11.75,00:23:11.75,"Villains, you're sitting out two people in this challenge."
350,00:23:13.71,00:23:13.71,Who's sitting out? >> Courtney and Sandra.

354,00:23:21.71,00:23:21.71,>> PROBST: Cirie sitting out for the Heroes.
355,00:23:23.71,00:23:23.71,"Sit-outs, take a spot on the bench."
356,00:23:25.67,00:23:25.67,"Give you a minute to strategize, we'll get started."
357,00:23:33.04,00:23:33.04,"All right, stepping up and leading for the Villains is Rob."
358,00:23:35.96,00:23:35.96,Tom calling the shots for the Heroes.
359,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,"Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready?"
360,00:23:43.25,00:23:43.25,"Go! >> Doing good, doing good."

375,00:24:17.25,00:24:17.25,There you go. Come on! >> That's good.
376,00:24:19.21,00:24:19.21,A little towards Rupert. A little faster.

378,00:24:23.08,00:24:23.08,">> A little speed. Coach's side, Coach's side."
379,00:24:25.04,00:24:25.04,>> PROBST: Villains very close. >> Right to the side.
380,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,">> PROBST: Take off your blindfolds, Coach and Tyson."
381,00:24:29.00,00:24:29.00,">> Okay, take 'em off, guys... Take 'em off."
382,00:24:31.04,00:24:31.04,">> PROBST: Get him in a position so he can see, and then you can"
383,00:24:34.04,00:24:34.04,start calling shots. >> Right there.
384,00:24:35.96,00:24:35.96,"Okay, Parvati, down. >> PROBST: Rob is guiding"
385,00:24:38.04,00:24:38.04,"Parvati, Russell, Danielle and Jerri."
386,00:24:40.79,00:24:40.79,">> Okay, good. >> PROBST: Heroes are now here."
387,00:24:42.79,00:24:42.79,>> I'm in. >> PROBST: Take off your
388,00:24:44.75,00:24:44.75,"blindfolds, get him oriented. >> Get me straight."
389,00:24:48.42,00:24:48.42,"J.T. and Amanda, down to the left a little bit."
390,00:24:51.25,00:24:51.25,">> PROBST: Tom guiding Colby, Candice, J.T. and Amanda."
391,00:24:54.92,00:24:54.92,">> A little more, a little more, a little more."
392,00:24:57.46,00:24:57.46,"Okay. >> Danielle, slowly lift it up."
393,00:24:59.79,00:24:59.79,"Russell down. >> PROBST: If they're right, the"
394,00:25:02.83,00:25:02.83,Villains have a bit of a lead. >> I want Danielle and Russell
395,00:25:05.92,00:25:05.92,to come up at the same time. Now.
396,00:25:07.92,00:25:07.92,"Good. Don't move, don't move. >> Colby and Candice towards my"
397,00:25:12.04,00:25:12.04,"voice now. Towards the guys, towards the"
398,00:25:14.04,00:25:14.04,"guys. A little more, a little more,"
399,00:25:16.04,00:25:16.04,"a little more, and a hard left. Hard. Yes! Great!"
400,00:25:18.50,00:25:18.50,">> There's a little gate here, so this is going to be the"
401,00:25:20.50,00:25:20.50,"tricky part, 'cause we can't let it go through."
402,00:25:22.79,00:25:22.79,"Parvati up, up. Russell, up, up, up."
403,00:25:28.00,00:25:28.00,"Good, good. Don't move..."
404,00:25:30.04,00:25:30.04,>> PROBST: Rob with a big move for the Villains.
405,00:25:32.04,00:25:32.04,">> All right, we want to go hard towards the ladies."
406,00:25:34.04,00:25:34.04,Hard towards the ladies. Yes! Great! Perfect!
407,00:25:38.96,00:25:38.96,>> PROBST: Tom with a nice move for the Heroes.
408,00:25:41.25,00:25:41.25,">> Russell and Danielle, slowly up."

410,00:25:45.25,00:25:45.25,don't move! >> PROBST: Very close now for
411,00:25:47.21,00:25:47.21,the Villains. >> Keep going now.
412,00:25:49.21,00:25:49.21,"Amanda's corner down, J.T. up. >> PROBST: Heroes close."
413,00:25:52.00,00:25:52.00,">> Jerri down, Jerri down. Oh!"
414,00:25:54.00,00:25:54.00,>> Down towards Amanda. Oh! No!
415,00:25:56.00,00:25:56.00,">> Jerri, up, up, up. And we got it."
416,00:25:58.00,00:25:58.00,>> We got it! >> PROBST: Villains win
417,00:26:00.00,00:26:00.00,immunity! (cheering)
418,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,">> Oh, my God! (screaming)"
419,00:26:04.00,00:26:04.00,>> I can't do anything. (indistinct chatter)
420,00:26:08.46,00:26:08.46,">> Hey, can someone help me out? >> Good job, Rob."
421,00:26:12.83,00:26:12.83,>> Good team work. Good team work.
422,00:26:15.42,00:26:15.42,">> PROBST: All right, Rob, you stepped up in a very gutsy"
423,00:26:18.50,00:26:18.50,position as caller. Paid off.
424,00:26:21.04,00:26:21.04,Immunity... for the Villains. >> Yay!
425,00:26:23.00,00:26:23.00,"(applause) >> PROBST: Heroes, you have the"
426,00:26:27.04,00:26:27.04,afternoon to figure out who's going home.
427,00:26:29.00,00:26:29.00,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
428,00:26:30.96,00:26:30.96,I will see you at Tribal. >> We're going back to Tribal
429,00:26:34.08,00:26:34.08,"Council, and getting rid of Colby or Tom tonight would be"
430,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,the smart thing to do. They have been on the outs with
431,00:26:41.33,00:26:41.33,"our tribe since maybe day three. And for my game, I need some of"
432,00:26:46.04,00:26:46.04,these strong people gone. (sighing)
433,00:27:03.17,00:27:03.17,">> I'm sorry, guys. >> No, you had the hardest damn"
434,00:27:05.17,00:27:05.17,job of it all. >> The challenge was a
435,00:27:14.75,00:27:14.75,heartbreaker. Colby and I are low men on the
436,00:27:17.71,00:27:17.71,"totem pole within the tribe, and the last thing I need is to be"
437,00:27:21.21,00:27:21.21,marching off to Tribal Council tonight.
438,00:27:23.38,00:27:23.38,"I have the immunity idol, but I'm still a target, because they"
439,00:27:26.50,00:27:26.50,know it's in my possession. So my game right now is biding
440,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,"my time and, uh, looking for the little cracks in their alliance"
441,00:27:33.92,00:27:33.92,that we can use to save our necks.
442,00:27:40.25,00:27:40.25,">> This is good, I think, for us."
443,00:27:42.25,00:27:42.25,">> Mm-hmm. Um, if we split the votes three"
444,00:27:47.62,00:27:47.62,and three... >> Mm-hmm.
445,00:27:49.62,00:27:49.62,>> ...on Tom and Colby... >> Mm-hmm.
446,00:27:51.67,00:27:51.67,>> ...and Tom plays the idol... >> Uh-huh.
447,00:27:53.62,00:27:53.62,>> ...Colby goes home because he's the one with the next most.
448,00:27:55.62,00:27:55.62,"Okay? If Tom doesn't play the idol,"
449,00:27:57.88,00:27:57.88,that would force a tie between the two of them.
450,00:28:00.17,00:28:00.17,Then the rest of us vote four on one and two on the other...
451,00:28:04.12,00:28:04.12,">> So, let me just get this straight-- tie-breaker."
452,00:28:06.08,00:28:06.08,And they can't vote at all. >> And they can't vote at all.
453,00:28:08.12,00:28:08.12,">> Oh, so we're good. >> So, if he plays the idol,"
454,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,"then, yeah. >> So either way, we're good."
455,00:28:12.21,00:28:12.21,>> Right. We're going to Tribal Council
456,00:28:14.21,00:28:14.21,"tonight, and we kind of have a plan of what we want to do."
457,00:28:16.67,00:28:16.67,"Tom has the idol, and we need to be extra careful right now."
458,00:28:21.21,00:28:21.21,"But as long as we're all on the same page, yeah, theoretically,"
459,00:28:25.00,00:28:25.00,"it should work out. >> Yeah, but he's not going to"
460,00:28:40.29,00:28:40.29,hurt us. >> It just scares me because
461,00:28:42.29,00:28:42.29,"Tom's smart, you know? >> I'm just telling you, I"
462,00:28:44.29,00:28:44.29,trust him a hell of a lot more than I trust Candice.
463,00:28:47.04,00:28:47.04,"I would love to have Tom and his idol in alliance with me,"
464,00:28:50.96,00:28:50.96,no doubt. Tom and Colby are both
465,00:28:52.96,00:28:52.96,shoot-you-straight kind of guys.
466,00:28:55.04,00:28:55.04,"They look you in the eye, shake your hand, tell you how they"
467,00:28:57.21,00:28:57.21,"feel, and you can take it to the bank."
468,00:28:59.12,00:28:59.12,">> Hey, there. >> But I'd rather have someone"
469,00:29:01.21,00:29:01.21,like that I can count on than Candice.
470,00:29:03.21,00:29:03.21,"The scrambling, the running around she's done the past"
471,00:29:05.21,00:29:05.21,couple of days. I don't trust her as far as I
472,00:29:07.21,00:29:07.21,can throw her. >> So I'm trying to figure out
473,00:29:09.75,00:29:09.75,what makes sense to you and you and James.
474,00:29:12.17,00:29:12.17,"And Colby and I, as partners, definitely makes more sense."
475,00:29:15.04,00:29:15.04,"I think you have two guys who are going to be honest, and two"
476,00:29:18.12,00:29:18.12,guys who are going to compete better than Cirie and Candice.
477,00:29:21.08,00:29:21.08,>> Mm-hmm. >> My concern is that because
478,00:29:24.58,00:29:24.58,"there is an immunity idol... I wish there wasn't one, and"
479,00:29:27.17,00:29:27.17,I'm trying to figure out how to get that stain off of me.
480,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,>> Why don't you just give me your word that immunity idol's
481,00:29:32.21,00:29:32.21,not going to be used against us or something.
482,00:29:34.21,00:29:34.21,">> Oh, no, no. I swear to God, we'll play that"
483,00:29:38.04,00:29:38.04,"thing as a committee. If there was no idol, I'd feel"
484,00:29:40.50,00:29:40.50,much better about this. The idol is scaring me.
485,00:29:43.00,00:29:43.00,"I can give it to you if one of you wants it, and then it's your"
486,00:29:46.08,00:29:46.08,idol. >> With Tom having the immunity
487,00:29:48.83,00:29:48.83,"idol, he's either a big threat, or someone  great to work with."
488,00:29:53.38,00:29:53.38,"I'm a little leery of him, because Tom has voted for me in"
489,00:29:56.08,00:29:56.08,"Tribal Council, but he was ready to give us the idol, and there's"
490,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,a part of him that I really do think is honest.
491,00:30:05.79,00:30:05.79,>> We were just talking about that.
492,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,">> I don't really trust Candice. >> I like her, but she's too"
493,00:30:13.21,00:30:13.21,"scatter-brained. >> I mean, I just want to win."
494,00:30:15.25,00:30:15.25,"I just want the strongest team. >> I want to win, too."
495,00:30:17.21,00:30:17.21,">> That's what I want, too. I am totally trusting you here,"
496,00:30:19.21,00:30:19.21,Tom. >> Okay. Come here.
497,00:30:21.21,00:30:21.21,"You know, I've been trying to ingratiate myself with the"
498,00:30:23.21,00:30:23.21,"powers that be, and I had a little something to bring to the"
499,00:30:25.79,00:30:25.79,"table at this point, so a supposed new alliance was born,"
500,00:30:29.38,00:30:29.38,"but I don't believe or trust anybody in this game, so we'll"
501,00:30:31.38,00:30:31.38,see. >> Mm-hmm.
502,00:30:43.42,00:30:43.42,">> He's, like, ""Well, I don't even want this thing."
503,00:30:45.46,00:30:45.46,I just want to be here. I'll even give it to one of you
504,00:30:47.46,00:30:47.46,"guys..."" >> Mm-hmm."
505,00:30:52.29,00:30:52.29,>> That is the dumbest thing. Did he give it to you?
506,00:30:56.96,00:30:56.96,>> Amanda. These are the same people that
507,00:30:59.79,00:30:59.79,wanted you gone desperately. >> I know.
508,00:31:01.88,00:31:01.88,>> Desperately. And now you're going to save
509,00:31:04.08,00:31:04.08,them? This is so stupid.
510,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,"Tom and Colby, and they're a much bigger threat than she is."
511,00:31:11.29,00:31:11.29,"Can you beat them? Oh, my God!"
512,00:31:16.21,00:31:16.21,"Amanda-- I love her to death, but she is not the sharpest tool"
513,00:31:20.12,00:31:20.12,in the shed. My alliance-- they're so
514,00:31:22.67,00:31:22.67,"wishy-washy. Like, these people, like, panic"
515,00:31:25.12,00:31:25.12,and do crazy stuff. Why didn't you tell me the plan
516,00:31:28.21,00:31:28.21,was changing? Unbelievable! Unbelievable!
517,00:31:34.88,00:31:34.88,"If she was so untrustworthy, your girl right here wouldn't"
518,00:31:37.67,00:31:37.67,"be standing here now. With this one, at least we can"
519,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,"keep her under control. >> Well, no."
520,00:31:42.12,00:31:42.12,"We haven't made up the final decision yet, though, babe."
521,00:31:44.46,00:31:44.46,>> I know. Come on.
522,00:31:46.46,00:31:46.46,Tom is very charismatic. He's very athletic.
523,00:31:49.75,00:31:49.75,He's already won this game once before.
524,00:31:52.96,00:31:52.96,Why keep someone like that in the game?
525,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,It makes no sense. It's crazy. >> Cirie is right.
526,00:32:06.58,00:32:06.58,"Amanda wants to do it, but Cirie's talking the rest out"
527,00:32:08.50,00:32:08.50,"of it. At this point, you need to get"
528,00:32:12.12,00:32:12.12,"your idol out, get it, because I ain't got any control any more."
529,00:32:15.79,00:32:15.79,Cirie's the mastermind behind this whole deal.
530,00:32:18.79,00:32:18.79,>> You know what? I thought that we had this thing
531,00:32:20.96,00:32:20.96,solid this afternoon. Amanda-- after she talked to
532,00:32:23.04,00:32:23.04,"Cirie-- she broke faith, and this deal was off."
533,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,"Cirie's the puppet master, and she's got her arm jammed up"
534,00:32:30.29,00:32:30.29,"there, so it could be the end of us."
535,00:32:41.88,00:32:41.88,">> They're going to vote three for me, three for you."
536,00:32:53.04,00:32:53.04,>> There you go. >> I've got to make a big
537,00:32:59.04,00:32:59.04,"decision, a very big decision. I've seen Cirie operate."
538,00:33:03.12,00:33:03.12,I know how she plays. And it won't be long before she
539,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,gets rid of someone like me. >> I think we do three and three
540,00:33:09.21,00:33:09.21,to keep Candice in and keep our six strong.
541,00:33:11.12,00:33:11.12,Yes? >> Yep.
542,00:33:13.08,00:33:13.08,>> All right. >> And we're not going to
543,00:33:14.42,00:33:14.42,discuss it no more. >> My gut's telling me to just
544,00:33:16.75,00:33:16.75,"go with the flow, write Colby's name down, and don't piss"
545,00:33:20.00,00:33:20.00,"everybody off, and my heart says I'm going to keep the good guys"
546,00:33:23.42,00:33:23.42,"in the game and get rid of Cirie, but you listen to your"
547,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,"heart, you get hurt out here, so it's all up to me."
548,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,"I know where everybody over here is voting, except me."
549,00:33:56.17,00:33:56.17,">> PROBST: So, last time you guys were at Tribal Council, you"
550,00:33:59.83,00:33:59.83,"voted out Steph, which seemed a little surprising, given that"
551,00:34:03.21,00:34:03.21,you've lost now three out of four immunity challenges.
552,00:34:06.58,00:34:06.58,"So, Tom, where is the philosophy of the tribe in terms of voting"
553,00:34:10.21,00:34:10.21,people out? >> Stephenie was on the wrong
554,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,side of the numbers formed on day one.
555,00:34:15.62,00:34:15.62,"She was with the wrong group, so she was sacrificed."
556,00:34:19.08,00:34:19.08,">> PROBST: So, Colby, if this game is already about alliances,"
557,00:34:22.29,00:34:22.29,is it inevitable that great people are going to go home
558,00:34:25.08,00:34:25.08,early merely because they're on the wrong side of the numbers?
559,00:34:28.21,00:34:28.21,">> It's unfortunate, but that looks to be what's going to take"
560,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,"place. >> PROBST: J.T., where is the"
561,00:34:34.83,00:34:34.83,wisdom in having alliances this early that cause you to vote out
562,00:34:38.92,00:34:38.92,somebody strong merely because they're on the wrong side of the
563,00:34:41.33,00:34:41.33,numbers? >> It's way too early to vote
564,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,out people that should get used to beat the other tribe.
565,00:34:46.54,00:34:46.54,"It's way too early for that, but unfortunately all of these"
566,00:34:49.62,00:34:49.62,people here are good and they all have reasons why they should
567,00:34:52.58,00:34:52.58,be here. >> PROBST: So then what do you
568,00:34:54.12,00:34:54.12,base the vote on? >> It's pretty simple-- you got
569,00:34:57.25,00:34:57.25,to have people that's not going to get scared.
570,00:34:59.33,00:34:59.33,They're going to stick to what they promised you to begin with.
571,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,">> PROBST: Rupert, how about you?"
572,00:35:04.08,00:35:04.08,What are you basing your vote on?
573,00:35:06.25,00:35:06.25,>> Trying to figure out how the heck we can bond together in
574,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,these challenges and win. But...
575,00:35:18.25,00:35:18.25,I made alliances that-- and promises that I want to keep.
576,00:35:22.62,00:35:22.62,>> PROBST: So it sounds like what you're saying with that
577,00:35:25.25,00:35:25.25,"long pause is: ""Not sure it will be the best vote, but I will be"
578,00:35:29.38,00:35:29.38,"keeping my word."" >> That is exactly what I am"
579,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,saying. I am keeping my word.
580,00:35:34.88,00:35:34.88,>> PROBST: Wow. >> I am going to stand up to
581,00:35:37.12,00:35:37.12,what I said. >> PROBST: What part of that
582,00:35:39.54,00:35:39.54,makes sense? Keeping your word in a game
583,00:35:41.96,00:35:41.96,"called ""Outwit, Outplay, Outlast""?"
584,00:35:43.50,00:35:43.50,Keeping your word because I'm an honorable man and I want people
585,00:35:46.21,00:35:46.21,to see me that way? 'Cause I'm looking at a tribe
586,00:35:49.00,00:35:49.00,"who-- you all keeping your word, great."
587,00:35:51.33,00:35:51.33,All it's doing is giving you more time with me at Tribal
588,00:35:53.21,00:35:53.21,Council. >> And sitting here at Tribal
589,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,"Council sucks, and I know I j... >> PROBST: You're a part of the"
590,00:35:59.12,00:35:59.12,"reason, based on that philosophy, Rupert."
591,00:36:00.62,00:36:00.62,>> I know I am. >> PROBST: That's the most
592,00:36:04.71,00:36:04.71,honest and illuminating answer we've had in any of our Tribals
593,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,"together. So, Cirie, how worried are you"
594,00:36:13.08,00:36:13.08,tonight that you might be going home?
595,00:36:15.08,00:36:15.08,">> I'm always worried, always. >> Tom, do you believe Cirie is"
596,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,worried that she's going home tonight?
597,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,>> I believe that Cirie is not worried that she's going home
598,00:36:23.62,00:36:23.62,"tonight. >> PROBST: Colby, are you"
599,00:36:25.54,00:36:25.54,concerned you're going home? >> Without question.
600,00:36:28.62,00:36:28.62,It's going to take a bold move to save me tonight.
601,00:36:32.12,00:36:32.12,">> PROBST: James, how you voting tonight?"
602,00:36:34.25,00:36:34.25,>> We need to win. I want gifts.
603,00:36:35.50,00:36:35.50,I want that food. I want to hold the idol.
604,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,"I want to do all that good stuff, you know?"
605,00:36:39.21,00:36:39.21,>> Are you going to base your vote on that tonight?
606,00:36:40.67,00:36:40.67,">> Yes, yes, sir. >> What you just said you"
607,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,"wanted? >> Yes, sir."
608,00:36:43.79,00:36:43.79,>> Okay. >> I want everybody to stop all
609,00:36:45.92,00:36:45.92,this crazy stuff and to win. >> PROBST: What's the crazy
610,00:36:48.46,00:36:48.46,stuff? >> Just the whole social thing.
611,00:36:51.04,00:36:51.04,The social game is a distraction.
612,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,"James don't do this stuff. >> But, James, it's a necessity"
613,00:36:56.08,00:36:56.08,if your name is the one on the top of the list to go home.
614,00:36:59.42,00:36:59.42,">> Yes, sir, I hear you. >> I agree, it's not fun, but"
615,00:37:02.96,00:37:02.96,"it's necessary when you're the one faced with leaving, you"
616,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,"know. >> PROBST: J.T., how concerned"
617,00:37:09.71,00:37:09.71,are you that you're going home? >> I don't feel like I'm going
618,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,"home tonight, and a lot of people are going to hate me for"
619,00:37:15.58,00:37:15.58,"saying it, but if I didn't trust the people that I put my trust"
620,00:37:18.25,00:37:18.25,"in tonight, I probably would already be gone, and I mean, I"
621,00:37:21.58,00:37:21.58,trust these people I'm in alliance with tonight.
622,00:37:24.54,00:37:24.54,">> PROBST: Well, there's a lot of talk tonight about trust and"
623,00:37:29.42,00:37:29.42,"an equal amount of apparent dissension, so I'm really"
624,00:37:32.29,00:37:32.29,curious to see how the vote plays out.
625,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,"It is time to vote. Rupert, you're up."
626,00:37:54.92,00:37:54.92,">> I think you're a great guy, but hopefully it's you and not"
627,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,"me tonight. >> Love you as a person, but"
628,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,you're way too good at wrapping some of these really weak minds
629,00:38:18.62,00:38:18.62,around your little finger. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
630,00:38:46.83,00:38:46.83,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
631,00:39:02.17,00:39:02.17,decision is final. Person voted out will be asked
632,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
633,00:39:06.75,00:39:06.75,I'll read the votes. >> Jeff.
634,00:39:11.25,00:39:11.25,I have something that I was hoping not to use until this
635,00:39:13.62,00:39:13.62,"team was able to use it against the Villains, but evident in"
636,00:39:16.83,00:39:16.83,"camp today was I needed it to save myself, so... I'd like to"
637,00:39:22.21,00:39:22.21,play the immunity idol. >> PROBST: Thank you.
638,00:39:29.50,00:39:29.50,The rules of Survivor state that if somebody plays the hidden
639,00:39:32.21,00:39:32.21,"immunity idol, then any votes cast against them will not count"
640,00:39:36.08,00:39:36.08,and the person with the next highest number of votes will be
641,00:39:38.71,00:39:38.71,"sent home. This is, indeed, a hidden"
642,00:39:40.79,00:39:40.79,immunity idol. Any votes cast for Tom will not
643,00:39:43.04,00:39:43.04,count. I'll read the votes.
644,00:39:49.71,00:39:49.71,First vote-- Tom. Does not count.

650,00:40:29.08,00:40:29.08,"Two votes-- Colby, one vote-- Cirie."
651,00:40:34.88,00:40:34.88,"Cirie. Two votes-- Colby, two votes--"
652,00:40:37.17,00:40:37.17,Cirie. One vote left.

656,00:41:10.33,00:41:10.33,"Time for you to go. Well, I would say that qualifies"
657,00:41:24.67,00:41:24.67,as your first blindside. Should make for a very
658,00:41:27.00,00:41:27.00,"interesting next few days. Grab your torches, head back to"
659,00:41:29.04,00:41:29.04,camp. Good night.

671,00:42:12.71,00:42:12.71,">> Maybe I said too much or stepped on J.T.'s toes, but I"
672,00:42:16.71,00:42:16.71,couldn't just sit back and play J.T.'s game.
673,00:42:19.88,00:42:19.88,"I'm playing this game for myself as well, so I couldn't do it."
674,00:42:24.29,00:42:24.29,I don't blame them at all. I felt like I was gotten with
675,00:42:27.88,00:42:27.88,"one of my moves. You know, my hats off to them."
676,00:42:30.62,00:42:30.62,They got me.
