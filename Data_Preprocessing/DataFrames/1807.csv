2,00:00:03.62,00:00:03.62,Survivor: >> Yes.
3,00:00:06.04,00:00:06.04,>> PROBST: Brendan and Sierra were in possession of the
4,00:00:08.42,00:00:08.42,"hidden immunity idol at Timbira. While their allies, Taj and"
5,00:00:13.12,00:00:13.12,"Stephen, made the discovery at Jalapao."
6,00:00:15.79,00:00:15.79,">> Okay, stuff this in your pocket."
7,00:00:17.25,00:00:17.25,"Do something with it, hide it. >> PROBST: Launch."
8,00:00:22.54,00:00:22.54,Spencer's poor defense at the challenge cost Jalapao immunity.
9,00:00:27.04,00:00:27.04,So J.T. wanted to vote him out. >> I don't have any problem
10,00:00:30.62,00:00:30.62,writing his name down. >> I don't want to get rid of
11,00:00:32.38,00:00:32.38,"anyone, but it's got to be Spencer."
12,00:00:34.54,00:00:34.54,>> Everybody can kiss my ass. >> PROBST: And Taj's
13,00:00:36.88,00:00:36.88,frustration at the loss caught Joe's attention.
14,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,>> Moves like that out here will get you voted off.
15,00:00:42.50,00:00:42.50,>> PROBST: But Taj was saved when the tribe came to an
16,00:00:45.04,00:00:45.04,"agreement. Spencer, the tribe has spoken."
17,00:00:49.33,00:00:49.33,"Down one member, can Jalapao regain their momentum?"
18,00:00:53.50,00:00:53.50,11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
19,00:01:05.29,00:01:05.29,">> What's up, Big T? >> Right."
20,00:01:10.08,00:01:10.08,>> Nobody wants to go. >> They're definitely not going
21,00:01:12.79,00:01:12.79,"to get any easier, though. >> I know."
22,00:01:14.88,00:01:14.88,>> It didn't bother me at all to see Spencer go.
23,00:01:17.21,00:01:17.21,"Only the fact that, you know, if there's a merge at ten,"
24,00:01:20.92,00:01:20.92,"rather than going in six-four, we only have a shot at going in"
25,00:01:23.58,00:01:23.58,"five-five.. Within the tribe right now,"
26,00:01:26.08,00:01:26.08,"I mean, we're all united. So if we were to lose again,"
27,00:01:29.33,00:01:29.33,it's going to be another tough one.
28,00:01:47.88,00:01:47.88,">> I'm serious, I'm tell you straight up."
29,00:01:49.71,00:01:49.71,>> I definitely feel nervous about being a target if we do
30,00:01:52.08,00:01:52.08,end up losing the next immunity challenge because the boys
31,00:01:56.00,00:01:56.00,"might stick together. Joe is awesome in challenges,"
32,00:01:59.71,00:01:59.71,and Stephen and J.T. are always hanging out together.
33,00:02:03.04,00:02:03.04,So I feel like Taj and I are on the chopping block.
34,00:02:10.88,00:02:10.88,>> You'll go to the merge. Sydney's very nervous because
35,00:02:15.12,00:02:15.12,"she knows that every time we lose, she's getting potentially"
36,00:02:17.75,00:02:17.75,closer to going home. And Taj is a very strong
37,00:02:20.92,00:02:20.92,challenger for a spot in the tribe.
38,00:02:23.62,00:02:23.62,"But I think J.T. and Steve trust Sydney, plus, I got a little"
39,00:02:27.71,00:02:27.71,"thing for Syd. I mean, she's gorgeous, so"
40,00:02:30.08,00:02:30.08,"she's safe. I mean, as far as I'm concerned,"
41,00:02:32.96,00:02:32.96,you got a free pass. >> I'm excited.

45,00:03:51.75,00:03:51.75,"(bird shrieking) >> Today, we were cooking beans,"
46,00:04:03.58,00:04:03.58,and they were finished. But Coach likes the beans cooked
47,00:04:07.04,00:04:07.04,"softer, so he decided to add dirty river water."
48,00:04:15.33,00:04:15.33,(thunder rumbles) >> The beans are just barely
49,00:04:17.92,00:04:17.92,"done, and that's when they eat them because they can't just"
50,00:04:20.92,00:04:20.92,wait. And actually it makes the beans
51,00:04:22.96,00:04:22.96,"taste good. You know, I mean, come on."
52,00:04:26.04,00:04:26.04,(thunder rumbles) >> Yeah.
53,00:04:42.08,00:04:42.08,>> This nasty storm has been rolling in all day.
54,00:04:44.29,00:04:44.29,"We knew it was coming, and it's just like, Coach, like, that's a"
55,00:04:47.08,00:04:47.08,pretty selfish decision. The worst part was is he put
56,00:04:54.08,00:04:54.08,"all that stuff in there, and then he didn't stay out there"
57,00:04:56.12,00:04:56.12,"and tend to the beans. Instead, he just got inside the"
58,00:04:58.21,00:04:58.21,shelter. It's another one of those
59,00:05:00.54,00:05:00.54,"""Coach moments."" >> It tastes funny."
60,00:05:08.17,00:05:08.17,>> I don't know what happened. >> They're not good?
61,00:05:10.33,00:05:10.33,>> Some of these beans are like charcoal.
62,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,">> Eventually, the rain stopped, and the beans burned--"
63,00:05:17.29,00:05:17.29,just stuck to the whole entire bottom.
64,00:05:19.33,00:05:19.33,We lost a good amount of beans. >> Half of our beans are burned
65,00:05:22.42,00:05:22.42,to the pot. >> Gross.
66,00:05:24.29,00:05:24.29,">> Ew! >> I mean, it's almost like"
67,00:05:26.58,00:05:26.58,"eating charcoal. >> Oh, my goodness."
68,00:05:32.04,00:05:32.04,>> There's just a part of me that finally just had had it.
69,00:05:34.92,00:05:34.92,I'm tired of feeding his needs. >> I don't know how many times
70,00:05:38.58,00:05:38.58,"we can clean the pot, but it's just going to cook it more and"
71,00:05:40.62,00:05:40.62,more each time. >> We didn't we clean the pot
72,00:05:42.08,00:05:42.08,after last time? >> I don't think that's why two
73,00:05:43.46,00:05:43.46,"inches of buildup came onto it. >> I'm just frustrated, as you"
74,00:05:51.67,00:05:51.67,would have been to one of us if we would have done it.
75,00:05:54.00,00:05:54.00,">> And the truth shall set you free, Sierra."
76,00:05:58.25,00:05:58.25,Go and be free! Always about the beans.
77,00:06:03.04,00:06:03.04,"Beans, beans, beans. Who gives a rip about these"
78,00:06:05.12,00:06:05.12,beans? It was really a combination
79,00:06:07.12,00:06:07.12,that I wanted them to cook longer.
80,00:06:08.67,00:06:08.67,"If it started raining, it was just a bad combination."
81,00:06:11.12,00:06:11.12,"No need to blame anybody. I know, that's what's eating at"
82,00:06:14.17,00:06:14.17,"you, and you wanted to say that. So thank you for saying that."
83,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,"I will acknowledge it. In fact, I'll take full"
84,00:06:18.17,00:06:18.17,responsibility. I don't care.
85,00:06:20.29,00:06:20.29,"I screwed up the beans, my bad. Forgive me, all of you."
86,00:06:26.12,00:06:26.12,"Especially you, Sierra, who seems to have the most angst"
87,00:06:28.33,00:06:28.33,about it. >> If you want your beans made a
88,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,"different way, maybe you should make it in a different pot."
89,00:06:32.96,00:06:32.96,>> I probably won't make a separate pot for my beans.
90,00:06:36.17,00:06:36.17,"You know, I can't believe this is going on over such a"
91,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,trivial subject. Screw all this stuff.
92,00:06:40.54,00:06:40.54,"It's all meaningless. Water under the bridge,"
93,00:06:43.00,00:06:43.00,"hopefully. It doesn't seem like it, but"
94,00:06:44.38,00:06:44.38,"hopefully it is. >> With Coach, there's probably"
95,00:06:47.25,00:06:47.25,"five, six situations like that where Coach has done things"
96,00:06:50.54,00:06:50.54,"where you're just like, ""Come on, that's really not for the"
97,00:06:53.25,00:06:53.25,best of everybody. That's for the best of just
98,00:06:54.92,00:06:54.92,"you."" But while he does do some"
99,00:06:57.00,00:06:57.00,"irritating things, I totally accept it because he's a"
100,00:07:00.17,00:07:00.17,predictable player. And predictable in this game
101,00:07:02.71,00:07:02.71,is-is great. >> I know.
102,00:07:16.17,00:07:16.17,"They're so good, though. >> I know."
103,00:07:19.04,00:07:19.04,"It's day 16, and it's getting strange around here."
104,00:07:22.79,00:07:22.79,Jalapao has only five tribe members left.
105,00:07:25.62,00:07:25.62,"Hopefully, everyone's got a good outlook on me."
106,00:07:28.21,00:07:28.21,"I am a country boy, you know, and it's hard for me to be mean"
107,00:07:31.08,00:07:31.08,to people. I've been honest with everyone
108,00:07:33.62,00:07:33.62,"here at Jalapao so far, and I'm gonna do my best to stay that"
109,00:07:36.17,00:07:36.17,"way. Hopefully, everyone's being"
110,00:07:38.38,00:07:38.38,honest with me as well. (Taj laughs)
111,00:07:45.96,00:07:45.96,">> What do you think? >> No, it'll work."
112,00:07:47.29,00:07:47.29,"I just heard it cracking. >> Well, I just think it will"
113,00:07:55.92,00:07:55.92,"solidify that I trust him enough, you know, to tell him"
114,00:07:58.96,00:07:58.96,the truth. >> I just think it might make
115,00:08:00.50,00:08:00.50,"him wary of you. >> Mm, I see what you're saying."
116,00:08:05.29,00:08:05.29,">> After the last Tribal Council, when J.T. voted for"
117,00:08:08.79,00:08:08.79,"Spencer over me, I-I just... that's when I knew that he was"
118,00:08:12.00,00:08:12.00,"definitely in our corner.  >> Taj came and said, ""I want to"
119,00:08:20.17,00:08:20.17,"tell J.T. about the idol.""  Until J.T. knows, I'm basically"
120,00:08:23.62,00:08:23.62,controlling the information flow between Taj and J.T. and to the
121,00:08:28.21,00:08:28.21,"extent possible, I want to remain that bridge because if"
122,00:08:31.33,00:08:31.33,"they connect, you know, I might become a less essential part of"
123,00:08:33.88,00:08:33.88,"the loop. He's going to trust me less,"
124,00:08:35.46,00:08:35.46,too. J.T. will if we tell him about
125,00:08:37.25,00:08:37.25,the idol. >> I wasn't gonna implicate
126,00:08:38.54,00:08:38.54,"you at all. >> Right, I'm just saying."
127,00:08:40.08,00:08:40.08,You haven't... >> The real alliance for me
128,00:08:42.25,00:08:42.25,"is my four-person alliance once the merge happens, which is"
129,00:08:45.04,00:08:45.04,"Steve, Brendan, Sierra, and myself."
130,00:08:48.54,00:08:48.54,"Here I just want to make it to the merge, and with J.T. on my"
131,00:08:51.79,00:08:51.79,"side, I'm going to be in good shape."
132,00:08:54.04,00:08:54.04,">> So, you're not going to tell him about Brendan then?"
133,00:08:56.54,00:08:56.54,">> Oh, no, no, no. Just about the idol."
134,00:08:58.25,00:08:58.25,">> Okay. >> Yeah, just about the idol."
135,00:09:04.75,00:09:04.75,">> No, I'm not sure at all. >> Okay."
136,00:09:12.75,00:09:12.75,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Timbira getting your first look"
137,00:09:22.54,00:09:22.54,at the new Jalapao tribe. Spencer voted out at the last
138,00:09:26.00,00:09:26.00,Tribal Council. >> Crazy.
139,00:09:29.21,00:09:29.21,>> PROBST: Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
140,00:09:31.42,00:09:31.42,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: For today's
141,00:09:33.08,00:09:33.08,"challenge, each tribe will have five minutes to build a"
142,00:09:35.62,00:09:35.62,barricade inside the other tribe's frame.
143,00:09:38.79,00:09:38.79,You will then attempt to toss ceramic pigs through the
144,00:09:41.88,00:09:41.88,barricade the other tribe built in your frame.
145,00:09:45.12,00:09:45.12,"If you drop a pig or if it breaks, it doesn't count."
146,00:09:48.58,00:09:48.58,The tribe with the most pigs on their bench at the end of ten
147,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,minutes wins reward. Want to know what you're
148,00:09:53.75,00:09:53.75,playing for? >> Yeah!
149,00:09:55.25,00:09:55.25,>> PROBST: The winning tribe will be taken to a beautiful
150,00:09:57.46,00:09:57.46,waterfall where you will enjoy a relaxing afternoon barbecue.
151,00:10:03.96,00:10:03.96,"Hamburgers, all the fixings. In addition, the winning tribe"
152,00:10:08.08,00:10:08.08,will choose one member from the losing tribe to go to Exile
153,00:10:10.67,00:10:10.67,Island. That person will in turn choose
154,00:10:13.46,00:10:13.46,"somebody from the winning tribe to join them, which means"
155,00:10:16.88,00:10:16.88,somebody from the winning tribe will not partake in the reward.
156,00:10:21.21,00:10:21.21,"I know it's worth playing for. Timbira, you have one extra"
157,00:10:23.25,00:10:23.25,"member, sitting somebody out. Cannot sit out the same person"
158,00:10:25.62,00:10:25.62,in back-to-back challenges. Who's going to sit this one
159,00:10:28.08,00:10:28.08,out? >> Erinn.
160,00:10:30.21,00:10:30.21,">> PROBST: Erinn, take a spot on the bench."
161,00:10:31.50,00:10:31.50,"Everybody else, we'll get started."
162,00:10:35.33,00:10:35.33,"Here we go, first stage. Each tribe will have five"
163,00:10:37.92,00:10:37.92,minutes to build a barricade in the other tribe's frame.
164,00:10:40.88,00:10:40.88,Survivors ready? Go!
165,00:10:43.17,00:10:43.17,">> Come on, guys! >> PROBST: The idea is to make"
166,00:10:47.08,00:10:47.08,this as impenetrable as possible so the other tribe can't get
167,00:10:50.96,00:10:50.96,"their pig through. >> Right here, just like that."
168,00:10:55.12,00:10:55.12,>> We need to put all these in the front.
169,00:10:57.71,00:10:57.71,>> That solid? >> No.
170,00:10:59.21,00:10:59.21,>> They're building X's. >> Look what they're doing.
171,00:11:02.79,00:11:02.79,>> PROBST: Four minutes left. You need to make them count.
172,00:11:17.54,00:11:17.54,">> PROBST: Five, four,"
173,00:11:20.08,00:11:20.08,"three, two,"
174,00:11:22.46,00:11:22.46,one. Stop the work.
175,00:11:24.58,00:11:24.58,"That's it. All right, each tribe now has"
176,00:11:31.62,00:11:31.62,ten minutes to get as many ceramic pigs through the
177,00:11:34.38,00:11:34.38,barricade built by the other tribe as you can.
178,00:11:37.29,00:11:37.29,Tribe with the most pigs at the end of ten minutes wins reward.
179,00:11:40.88,00:11:40.88,Survivors ready? Go.
180,00:11:43.17,00:11:43.17,">> Come on, guys. >> PROBST: Can only throw one"
181,00:11:44.96,00:11:44.96,pig at a time. If it drops or it breaks like
182,00:11:47.33,00:11:47.33,"that one, doesn't count. >> Sorry."
183,00:11:53.17,00:11:53.17,"Next. >> Come on, guys!"
184,00:11:55.08,00:11:55.08,>> PROBST: A lot of pigs breaking right now.
185,00:11:57.12,00:11:57.12,Big learning curve here. Brendan to Tyson.
186,00:12:00.83,00:12:00.83,Easily to Coach. Coach to Sierra.
187,00:12:04.96,00:12:04.96,Timbira is on the board with their first point.
188,00:12:07.17,00:12:07.17,There's one through. Joe to J.T.

237,00:14:48.12,00:14:48.12,"Let me smash it! >> PROBST: Timbira,"
238,00:14:55.58,00:14:55.58,"congratulations. All right, first decision."
239,00:14:58.67,00:14:58.67,Who from Jalapao are you going to send to Exile Island?
240,00:15:02.08,00:15:02.08,">> Right now, everything with Brendan, Sierra, and Stephen is"
241,00:15:05.38,00:15:05.38,in place. We have both idols.
242,00:15:07.96,00:15:07.96,"We have the alliance intact. So, when Timbira had to send"
243,00:15:11.83,00:15:11.83,"someone to Exile Island, all I kept thinking was, send someone"
244,00:15:15.12,00:15:15.12,else. >> Joe.
245,00:15:18.21,00:15:18.21,>> PROBST: Joe going to Exile Island.
246,00:15:20.08,00:15:20.08,"Joe, grab your personal items. Come on over."
247,00:15:22.96,00:15:22.96,"Joe, now you have a little power."
248,00:15:25.21,00:15:25.21,"You get to pick somebody from Timbira to join you on Exile,"
249,00:15:28.33,00:15:28.33,"and you will keep them from the waterfall, burgers, all the"
250,00:15:31.88,00:15:31.88,"fixings. >> Uh... come on, Erinn."
251,00:15:37.75,00:15:37.75,The decision to bring Erinn with me to Exile was strategic
252,00:15:41.04,00:15:41.04,"because going into a merge, we need somebody to flip, and my"
253,00:15:44.08,00:15:44.08,"charm game is definitely part of my strategy, and she's an"
254,00:15:47.75,00:15:47.75,attractive woman. >> PROBST: Who wants the map?
255,00:15:50.83,00:15:50.83,>> He can take it. >> I'll take it.
256,00:15:53.00,00:15:53.00,">> PROBST: All right, guys. Head out to Exile."
257,00:15:55.04,00:15:55.04,You'll both return in time for the next immunity challenge.
258,00:15:58.12,00:15:58.12,"Timbira, ready for a fun afternoon?"
259,00:16:00.92,00:16:00.92,>> Absolutely! >> Like nothing else.
260,00:16:02.33,00:16:02.33,>> PROBST: Grab your stuff. Head out. Enjoy it.
261,00:16:04.04,00:16:04.04,">> Bye, guys. >> Thanks."
262,00:16:06.42,00:16:06.42,"See you, guys. >> PROBST: All right, guys."
263,00:16:09.46,00:16:09.46,"I got nothing for you. Jalapao, head back to camp."
264,00:16:12.12,00:16:12.12,">> We definitely lost a reward today, and it sucked, but I'm"
265,00:16:14.88,00:16:14.88,not going to feel sorry for myself all day.
266,00:16:17.25,00:16:17.25,"I mean, I don't really care about the reward."
267,00:16:18.96,00:16:18.96,It's just a reward. But if we lose the next immunity
268,00:16:21.21,00:16:21.21,"challenge, we go down six-four in numbers, so we just can't"
269,00:16:24.75,00:16:24.75,blow it. We need to win.
270,00:16:39.42,00:16:39.42,(squealing excitedly) >> Yep.
271,00:16:44.62,00:16:44.62,">> High five, man. >> Oh, yeah!"
272,00:16:47.75,00:16:47.75,">> When we walked into the reward, we saw, like, the"
273,00:16:50.33,00:16:50.33,"perfect all-American picnic. I mean, watermelon, chips,"
274,00:16:54.08,00:16:54.08,"cooler of drinks. >> Look, there's hamburgers"
275,00:16:57.17,00:16:57.17,"over there on the grill! Oh, my God!"
276,00:17:01.96,00:17:01.96,">> I'm going to eat enough to puke, and then I have room for"
277,00:17:04.25,00:17:04.25,"hamburgers after that. >> Oh, yum."
278,00:17:08.25,00:17:08.25,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my gosh!"
279,00:17:11.96,00:17:11.96,>> Unbelievable. >> The first bite of the burger
280,00:17:15.12,00:17:15.12,"was just like heaven, basically. >> There's so much food that I"
281,00:17:19.12,00:17:19.12,can't fit enough in my mouth. >> Manners were out the window.
282,00:17:23.50,00:17:23.50,"Eating as much as we could. I mean, we were like animals."
283,00:17:31.67,00:17:31.67,">> Oh, my gosh! >> Oh, my God, look at that"
284,00:17:34.42,00:17:34.42,waterfall. >> This is so amazing.
285,00:17:45.17,00:17:45.17,>> The water is just so crystal clear.
286,00:17:48.17,00:17:48.17,"It's beautiful. >> Oh, wow."
287,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,">> A small part of me feels guilty that Erinn is not here,"
288,00:17:55.58,00:17:55.58,"but in my opinion, she's lucky to still be in this game."
289,00:17:58.04,00:17:58.04,"These people right here, uh, from the tribe, these are the"
290,00:18:01.08,00:18:01.08,people I would have picked to be enjoying this with.
291,00:18:03.46,00:18:03.46,>> Go. (cheering)
292,00:18:06.04,00:18:06.04,">> All in all, a great win, great day."
293,00:18:08.88,00:18:08.88,There's no bickering. It's awesome.
294,00:18:11.00,00:18:11.00,"It's good to feel that momentum back, especially this late in"
295,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,the game. (laughter)
296,00:18:25.21,00:18:25.21,">> ""You must each choose an urn."""
297,00:18:27.67,00:18:27.67,I insist. Ladies first.
298,00:18:41.12,00:18:41.12,">> All right, he's out. I'll see you in a while."
299,00:18:43.25,00:18:43.25,">> Later. >> Joe and I came out to Exile,"
300,00:18:45.58,00:18:45.58,"picked two urns, and I got the one with the clue in it."
301,00:18:48.62,00:18:48.62,It's very apparent that the idol is not here.
302,00:18:51.25,00:18:51.25,"It's back at camp. And if it's back at camp,"
303,00:18:53.75,00:18:53.75,"there's more than one, so now I just need to figure out: do I"
304,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,trust Joe? Do I not trust Joe?
305,00:18:59.38,00:18:59.38,Because I have no alliances out here.
306,00:19:02.08,00:19:02.08,"So, he could be a good ally, and if we were aligned and had two"
307,00:19:05.71,00:19:05.71,"idols, that might not be a bad thing for us."
308,00:19:08.96,00:19:08.96,">> So, who's your favorite over there?"
309,00:19:10.46,00:19:10.46,>> I don't know about favorites. Can you have favorites in this?
310,00:19:12.29,00:19:12.29,"How about you? >> Uh, J.T."
311,00:19:14.96,00:19:14.96,"J.T. is a good dude. >> Yeah, he seems like it."
312,00:19:18.92,00:19:18.92,>> We'll be up and running here soon.
313,00:19:21.46,00:19:21.46,"Need any help with those clues? >> Oh, maybe."
314,00:19:24.04,00:19:24.04,I'll let you know. >> Let me know.
315,00:19:26.04,00:19:26.04,Maybe we can work on it together or something.
316,00:19:28.17,00:19:28.17,"I picked the empty urn, and I have no clue where the idol is."
317,00:19:30.79,00:19:30.79,"Uh, I think she knows where it's at, so hopefully I can just get"
318,00:19:34.08,00:19:34.08,"it out of her, but we'll see how it goes."
319,00:19:36.17,00:19:36.17,"There's got to be one out here, you know."
320,00:19:39.25,00:19:39.25,Let's go find both of them. They're at camp?
321,00:19:45.04,00:19:45.04,>> I decided I was going to tell Joe about the idol.
322,00:19:48.92,00:19:48.92,I'm hoping that Joe turns out to be a trustworthy individual.
323,00:19:53.00,00:19:53.00,"""Go to the spot where you often get mail."
324,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,"""Don't skirt the issue. Try lifting the veil."""
325,00:19:59.62,00:19:59.62,>> It's right there. >> Yeah.
326,00:20:01.08,00:20:01.08,>> Your tree mail. >> Easy if it's still there.
327,00:20:03.67,00:20:03.67,">> I'll let you know, all right? >> Good stuff."
328,00:20:06.46,00:20:06.46,>> This couldn't be any better right now.
329,00:20:08.04,00:20:08.04,"I picked the empty urn, and now I know where the idol is."
330,00:20:10.17,00:20:10.17,"If Erinn and I both get the immunity idol, that's a"
331,00:20:13.21,00:20:13.21,humongous alliance. It could probably rival anything
332,00:20:16.42,00:20:16.42,that I have back at... at camp. (squawking)
333,00:20:23.00,00:20:23.00,">> When Joe comes back, he's going to have enough clues to"
334,00:20:25.83,00:20:25.83,find the idol in about 30 seconds.
335,00:20:28.46,00:20:28.46,">> Right, so we need to put something in the tree mail ASAP."
336,00:20:31.54,00:20:31.54,>> I have some stuff. I have some feathers.
337,00:20:34.58,00:20:34.58,I have some leather straps. >> That will be fine.
338,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,"I mean, anything that looks authentic."
339,00:20:38.71,00:20:38.71,"When Joe comes back from Exile looking for the immunity idol,"
340,00:20:42.08,00:20:42.08,"he'll have all the clues, so he'll know to look inside tree"
341,00:20:45.67,00:20:45.67,"mail, and I don't want him to know that I already have it, so"
342,00:20:49.12,00:20:49.12,I need to make the best-looking little fake idol that I can come
343,00:20:52.29,00:20:52.29,up with. I just went to pick up the real
344,00:20:56.21,00:20:56.21,idol from Stephen's pants pocket just to know what it looks like
345,00:20:59.92,00:20:59.92,so I can make it look authentic and genuine.
346,00:21:02.33,00:21:02.33,"Hopefully, I'll be able to throw Joe off."
347,00:21:23.29,00:21:23.29,(chuckling) >> Yeah.
348,00:22:05.88,00:22:05.88,>> Stephen and I was going fishing.
349,00:22:07.92,00:22:07.92,"So, I go to grab an empty bag, and right on top is the hidden"
350,00:22:12.46,00:22:12.46,"immunity idol. Apparently, Taj found the idol."
351,00:22:21.25,00:22:21.25,"And I was like, ""Oh, my God."" >> I know it's right there!"
352,00:22:30.46,00:22:30.46,"When J.T. found the idol, I was thinking what the heck do I say?"
353,00:22:35.67,00:22:35.67,"So I said, ""I know,"" and, you know, I don't think I had the"
354,00:22:39.38,00:22:39.38,appropriate amount of shock on my face.
355,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,>> Do you think she just now found it?
356,00:22:49.25,00:22:49.25,>> Yeah. >> Or that's good.
357,00:22:53.83,00:22:53.83,"I mean, I think she was just worried, you know, about the"
358,00:22:56.08,00:22:56.08,"next vote, so wanted to make sure we were all on board."
359,00:23:00.00,00:23:00.00,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
360,00:23:03.46,00:23:03.46,">> Oh, we-we got a hidden immunity idol at camp."
361,00:23:14.29,00:23:14.29,>> J.T.? >> Yeah.
362,00:23:16.04,00:23:16.04,>> Yeah. >> I wanted to just talk to Taj
363,00:23:18.58,00:23:18.58,to tell her that J.T. found the idol in her bag.
364,00:23:22.79,00:23:22.79,And she has to tell J.T. that she has it so the three of us
365,00:23:26.12,00:23:26.12,are on the same page. >> J.T.
366,00:23:32.04,00:23:32.04,Look. I got you some puka berries.
367,00:23:37.04,00:23:37.04,">> Oh, I-I seen this a while ago before I left."
368,00:23:39.12,00:23:39.12,>> Did you? >> Yes.
369,00:23:40.71,00:23:40.71,>> How? >> I walked over here...
370,00:23:44.92,00:23:44.92,That is beautiful. >> Isn't it gorgeous?
371,00:23:47.12,00:23:47.12,">> That is beautiful. It's a necklace, isn't it?"
372,00:23:49.21,00:23:49.21,>> Yeah. >> You got to hide it 'cause

376,00:23:57.25,00:23:57.25,Stephen to go out prematurely for no reason.
377,00:24:00.04,00:24:00.04,"If you need it, you can have it. I'm serious."
378,00:24:03.08,00:24:03.08,>> All right. Taj showed me the idol.
379,00:24:05.71,00:24:05.71,"I think she felt like she could trust me, and her sharing this"
380,00:24:09.29,00:24:09.29,information was huge. 'Cause Taj has just made a
381,00:24:12.21,00:24:12.21,promise to me that any time that I may need the hidden immunity
382,00:24:15.17,00:24:15.17,"idol, she would give it to me. So, that... I mean, that's big."
383,00:24:18.92,00:24:18.92,"That's a big promise, you know. Hopefully, she'll keep it."
384,00:24:25.04,00:24:25.04,>> Yeah. >> Here.
385,00:24:30.04,00:24:30.04,"All right, now everybody give me theirs hands."
386,00:24:32.67,00:24:32.67,"We're going to the merge. >> Yeah, we're going to the end."

388,00:24:41.25,00:24:41.25,Stephen in a really tight alliance.
389,00:24:43.33,00:24:43.33,It doesn't make me uncomfortable that they found the idol before
390,00:24:46.17,00:24:46.17,Taj showed it to me. It took her a little while to
391,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,"come around, but she was honest. And Stephen has been very honest"
392,00:24:52.08,00:24:52.08,"with me, and I feel like I can trust Stephen all the way."
393,00:24:56.29,00:24:56.29,I just hope I'm not wrong. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

404,00:25:58.17,00:25:58.17,The emptying sand will cause the next tile to be revealed and
405,00:26:01.29,00:26:01.29,will release a bag of puzzle pieces from above.
406,00:26:04.75,00:26:04.75,"You'll retrieve the bag, move on to the next tile."

452,00:28:23.83,00:28:23.83,target on that third tile will not get any larger than it is
453,00:28:27.54,00:28:27.54,right now. It has been J.T. and Tyson all
454,00:28:30.71,00:28:30.71,the way. Nobody else has fired a shot.

482,00:29:50.00,00:29:50.00,Jalapao could be right back in this.
483,00:29:53.62,00:29:53.62,">> Nope. No, it doesn't fit."
484,00:29:55.21,00:29:55.21,">> Hold on, one more. >> That fits, there."

505,00:30:56.83,00:30:56.83,"And I really think that this was so pivotal, this win, because it"
506,00:31:00.04,00:31:00.04,really shifts control of the game.
507,00:31:02.17,00:31:02.17,">> PROBST: Timbira, grab your stuff."
508,00:31:03.17,00:31:03.17,Head back to camp. Enjoy the night off.
509,00:31:06.21,00:31:06.21,"Jalapao, I got nothing for you except a date with me once again"

512,00:31:15.25,00:31:15.25,I will see you at Tribal. >> It's not a good thing to go
513,00:31:18.67,00:31:18.67,to Tribal Council. I've been told by Joe I am safer
514,00:31:23.00,00:31:23.00,"than Taj, but you know, no one's safe at this point."
515,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,And it really just sucks. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
516,00:31:41.17,00:31:41.17,">> Damn! I'm sorry, guys."
517,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,">> Man, I want to say nobody blames you at all."
518,00:31:47.67,00:31:47.67,">> No, not at all. >> It's hard not to."
519,00:31:49.67,00:31:49.67,">> Every challenge you're at, you give your all, and like this"
520,00:31:51.75,00:31:51.75,"time it didn't work out as well. >> Are you all right, man?"
521,00:31:54.96,00:31:54.96,>> Your leg looks bad. It's red all the way down from
522,00:31:58.33,00:31:58.33,the knee to the ankle. >> Pretty painful.
523,00:32:07.00,00:32:07.00,"This should be good, like, tomorrow."
524,00:32:10.21,00:32:10.21,">> Oh, man, that place sucks. What do you think?"
525,00:32:14.88,00:32:14.88,>> No way? You didn't?
526,00:32:16.46,00:32:16.46,">> I let her go first. I go, ""I insist."""
527,00:32:19.83,00:32:19.83,>> She didn't show it to you? >> I tried to juice her for
528,00:32:22.12,00:32:22.12,info. >> Nothing?
529,00:32:23.58,00:32:23.58,">> Nada. >> Wow, that's weird."
530,00:32:25.17,00:32:25.17,">> It was a long two days, man. >> I need some water."
531,00:32:37.58,00:32:37.58,"(laughing) >> At Exile, Erinn gave me a"
532,00:32:44.04,00:32:44.04,"scroll with five clues on it, and it was really easy."
533,00:32:48.04,00:32:48.04,"I mean, I walked up and got the idol in literally ten seconds."
534,00:32:51.38,00:32:51.38,This is the hidden immunity idol.
535,00:32:54.17,00:32:54.17,"""Don't skirt the issue. Try lifting the veil."
536,00:32:56.42,00:32:56.42,"Here it is."" I was stoked."
537,00:32:58.04,00:32:58.04,Just pure relief. Now I feel like I got a great
538,00:33:01.62,00:33:01.62,"shot at extra time in this game. >> Tonight, we are all voting"
539,00:33:23.21,00:33:23.21,for Taj. Joe made sure we were all on the
540,00:33:25.88,00:33:25.88,"same page, and that's that. I think Taj knows something's"
541,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,"up, but she's not someone who's trying to stab people behind"
542,00:33:33.88,00:33:33.88,their backs or trying to talk crap right before we have Tribal
543,00:33:36.54,00:33:36.54,Council. She's not that kind of person.
544,00:33:42.04,00:33:42.04,>> I don't believe I have anything to worry about tonight
545,00:33:45.46,00:33:45.46,at Tribal Council. I think I have Stephen and
546,00:33:47.58,00:33:47.58,"J.T.'s trust completely, and plus I have the idol."
547,00:33:51.46,00:33:51.46,">> Yeah, it's perfect. >> I think Sydney believes"
548,00:33:54.58,00:33:54.58,everything is going to work in her favor because Joe is going
549,00:33:57.29,00:33:57.29,"to protect her, but I'm pretty confident tonight I'm not going."
550,00:34:00.12,00:34:00.12,(laughs) >> Yeah.
551,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,">> Taj, myself, and Stephen have a tight alliance right now, and"
552,00:34:20.62,00:34:20.62,Taj has got the hidden immunity idol that I could use.
553,00:34:23.83,00:34:23.83,"You know, that's just like my idol, and there's no way I could"
554,00:34:27.33,00:34:27.33,vote my hidden immunity idol out of this game right now.
555,00:34:30.88,00:34:30.88,He's gonna want to know why it's got to be Sydney and not Taj.
556,00:34:41.96,00:34:41.96,">> Whoo! Oh, dude."
557,00:34:45.67,00:34:45.67,">> It feels good, don't it? >> Yeah, man."
558,00:35:13.21,00:35:13.21,>> We should at least talk about it.
559,00:35:19.71,00:35:19.71,">> I go to the water to talk with J.T. and Steve, and they"
560,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,got this crazy look in their eye about keeping Taj.
561,00:35:27.25,00:35:27.25,"They started talking out all these plans that could happen,"
562,00:35:30.46,00:35:30.46,but I kind of envisioned Taj being the odd man out and going
563,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,home should we lose. I need to try to honor that.
564,00:35:48.21,00:35:48.21,The three of us were not in any agreement on who to vote for
565,00:35:51.54,00:35:51.54,"tonight, and if J.T. and Steve-- they don't really give me"
566,00:35:55.21,00:35:55.21,"consideration, then I might hand over the idol to Sydney and make"
567,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,a point. (thunder rumbles)
568,00:36:12.29,00:36:12.29,(Stephen sighs) >> We don't want that.
569,00:36:19.46,00:36:19.46,">> Uh-uh, and if we get rid of her, the idol's gone, too."
570,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,">> Well, that's not true. >> She gave it to you, didn't"
571,00:36:28.88,00:36:28.88,she? You have the idol.
572,00:36:34.25,00:36:34.25,She told you to put it in your pocket and keep it.
573,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,>> That means it's technically mine.
574,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,>> It's your idol right now. >> Yeah.
575,00:36:46.17,00:36:46.17,">> I mean, that guarantees you and I have the idol."
576,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,"Oh, man, this is tough. I do believe Taj is comfortable"
577,00:36:55.79,00:36:55.79,right now because she has a very strong alliance with Stephen and
578,00:36:58.58,00:36:58.58,"myself, but the idol is in Stephen and my possession"
579,00:37:02.75,00:37:02.75,"already, so I could vote Taj out right now, and we'll still have"
580,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,the idol. I have no idea what I'm doing.
581,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,I'm probably gonna decide when I get there.
582,00:37:14.96,00:37:14.96,This is terrible. I'm going to hell.
583,00:37:19.12,00:37:19.12,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: J.T., give me the"
584,00:37:32.25,00:37:32.25,state of affairs of this game right now.
585,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,"Where does it sit? >> Jeff, it ain't sitting real"
586,00:37:36.62,00:37:36.62,"good for Jalapao right now. You know, we're down two members"
587,00:37:39.79,00:37:39.79,"after tonight, and if there's a merge, we're down and out."
588,00:37:42.88,00:37:42.88,">> PROBST: Stephen, how much time is spent talking about a"
589,00:37:46.25,00:37:46.25,possible merge? >> It's looming real large for
590,00:37:48.96,00:37:48.96,"us, and especially now that we're about to be down to four"
591,00:37:51.58,00:37:51.58,"tribe members, you know, we're all a little bit intimidated of"
592,00:37:54.04,00:37:54.04,"what might happen. >> PROBST: Joe, if you do merge,"
593,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,"just based on numbers, you're in trouble."
594,00:37:59.42,00:37:59.42,So how much of tonight's vote is going to be made based on a
595,00:38:03.92,00:38:03.92,possible merge? >> I would say the vote tonight
596,00:38:06.92,00:38:06.92,"is based on trust. To go into a merge, I want"
597,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,"somebody who I know I can share information with, they'll share"
598,00:38:13.12,00:38:13.12,"information with me, and it won't leave outside that."
599,00:38:16.62,00:38:16.62,">> PROBST: Taj, is this a point in the game where being on Exile"
600,00:38:19.46,00:38:19.46,so many days can work against you?
601,00:38:21.46,00:38:21.46,"You've spent so much time with people from the other tribe, you"
602,00:38:24.25,00:38:24.25,could have the idol. You have a lot of potential
603,00:38:26.67,00:38:26.67,"weapons. >> Definitely, but I don't think"
604,00:38:28.71,00:38:28.71,it's a matter that they don't trust me.
605,00:38:30.54,00:38:30.54,It's just the situations that I've been in are distrustful.
606,00:38:33.62,00:38:33.62,">> PROBST: So if you guys were to merge, how are you going to"
607,00:38:36.21,00:38:36.21,help these other four people get further in the game?
608,00:38:38.17,00:38:38.17,">> Well, I think that I will be able to create relationships on"
609,00:38:41.12,00:38:41.12,the other side with Timbira. I've been on Exile with Sierra
610,00:38:44.83,00:38:44.83,"and Brendan, so I think I could probably talk them into maybe"
611,00:38:48.08,00:38:48.08,flipping over on our side. I think I'd be valuable in that
612,00:38:50.88,00:38:50.88,"way. >> PROBST: J.T., the flip side"
613,00:38:53.29,00:38:53.29,of what Taj is talking about is she's made relationships.
614,00:38:57.00,00:38:57.00,You haven't. >> Exactly.
615,00:38:59.08,00:38:59.08,"I worry about that, too, Jeff, you know."
616,00:39:01.00,00:39:01.00,"She could always fall in with them and start another alliance,"
617,00:39:04.21,00:39:04.21,"and we'd still be sitting ducks. >> PROBST: Sydney, how about"
618,00:39:07.33,00:39:07.33,you? What do you bring that could
619,00:39:09.25,00:39:09.25,help the rest of Jalapao if you merge?
620,00:39:12.25,00:39:12.25,">> Well, I mean, it's not like I spent Exile time with a bunch of"
621,00:39:15.21,00:39:15.21,"people from the other tribe, so I definitely bring loyalty to"
622,00:39:19.25,00:39:19.25,these people. >> PROBST: So you are the flip
623,00:39:21.33,00:39:21.33,"of Taj. Taj is saying, ""I have"
624,00:39:23.46,00:39:23.46,"relationships. I will utilize them."""
625,00:39:25.46,00:39:25.46,"You're saying, ""I don't have any relationships."
626,00:39:27.42,00:39:27.42,"I'm loyal to the tribe I was born into."""
627,00:39:30.08,00:39:30.08,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Joe, one of the"
628,00:39:32.04,00:39:32.04,advantages Timbira has with the numbers is they have options.
629,00:39:35.38,00:39:35.38,Jalapao doesn't have any options.
630,00:39:37.38,00:39:37.38,"If you guys don't stick together, you're in trouble."
631,00:39:40.12,00:39:40.12,>> That's why I feel it's so important to go into the merge
632,00:39:43.42,00:39:43.42,"knowing that you at least have four, and you can't have any"
633,00:39:47.29,00:39:47.29,"doubt that they're going to, you know, do anything drastic and"
634,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,"leave you. >> PROBST: So dead set, know"
635,00:39:51.46,00:39:51.46,what you're doing tonight on the vote?
636,00:39:53.38,00:39:53.38,">> Yeah, I'm ready to put pencil to paper."
637,00:39:56.08,00:39:56.08,">> PROBST: J.T., any questions in your mind as we get ready to"
638,00:39:58.58,00:39:58.58,"vote? >> All afternoon, Jeff, and it's"
639,00:40:01.58,00:40:01.58,still going through my mind right now.
640,00:40:03.29,00:40:03.29,"Here I am: I blew the challenge today, and I got to make a"
641,00:40:05.67,00:40:05.67,decision to send someone home. It's a terrible situation for me
642,00:40:09.17,00:40:09.17,"to be in right now. >> PROBST: Well, the time has"
643,00:40:12.21,00:40:12.21,come to make that decision. It is time to vote.
644,00:40:15.42,00:40:15.42,"Joe, you're up. >> This is not an easy decision."
645,00:40:27.50,00:40:27.50,"Good luck. >> (whispering): Love you, girl."
646,00:40:56.00,00:40:56.00,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
647,00:41:06.17,00:41:06.17,votes. If anybody has the hidden

649,00:41:24.25,00:41:24.25,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
650,00:41:28.67,00:41:28.67,the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked
651,00:41:30.67,00:41:30.67,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
652,00:41:32.92,00:41:32.92,I'll read the votes. First vote: Sydney.
653,00:41:44.04,00:41:44.04,Taj. One vote Sydney;
654,00:41:47.17,00:41:47.17,one vote Taj. Taj.

660,00:42:20.04,00:42:20.04,>> PROBST: You need to bring me your torch.
661,00:42:32.54,00:42:32.54,"Sydney, the tribe has spoken. Well, there was a lot of"
662,00:42:51.17,00:42:51.17,discussion tonight about a possible merge.
663,00:42:53.50,00:42:53.50,"If indeed you guys merge down two members, you've got your"
