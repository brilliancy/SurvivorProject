2,00:00:07.23,00:00:07.23,"JEFF PROBST:  36 days ago, deep within"
3,00:00:09.37,00:00:09.37," the world's largest  rain forest,"
4,00:00:11.53,00:00:11.53, 16 Americans began  the adventure of a lifetime.
5,00:00:14.30,00:00:14.30," They were abandoned  on the Rio Negro,"
6,00:00:17.33,00:00:17.33, in the heart of the Amazon.
7,00:00:18.90,00:00:18.90,"As I call out your name, I want you to climb"
8,00:00:20.90,00:00:20.90,down the rope ladder and get in the yellow boat.
9,00:00:22.80,00:00:22.80, The castaways were shocked  to learn
10,00:00:25.07,00:00:25.07, the tribes were divided  by gender.
11,00:00:27.13,00:00:27.13,ROGER: It's going to be the men  against the women.
12,00:00:28.97,00:00:28.97, But they don't have  the strength.
13,00:00:30.90,00:00:30.90,It's pathetic.
14,00:00:31.87,00:00:31.87,PROBST:  And Christy had a shock
15,00:00:33.50,00:00:33.50, of her own  for the Jaburu women.
16,00:00:35.57,00:00:35.57,"It's not a big deal, but I think it's something"
17,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,that every tribe member should know-- that I am deaf.
18,00:00:40.30,00:00:40.30,JENNA: I'm just wondering  how she's going to be able
19,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60, to work with the group  when she can't
20,00:00:44.37,00:00:44.37,really hear well.
21,00:00:45.43,00:00:45.43,"PROBST:  That night, Christy discovered"
22,00:00:47.70,00:00:47.70, she had trouble communicating  with her tribe.
23,00:00:49.20,00:00:49.20,"CHRISTY: As soon as it  gets dark, that's where"
24,00:00:52.80,00:00:52.80,"my whole communication just shuts down,"
25,00:00:55.87,00:00:55.87, because I can't see...  can't read their lips.
26,00:00:59.23,00:00:59.23,(crying): I'm at a big disadvantage.
27,00:01:04.67,00:01:04.67,PROBST: The men of Tambaqui  quickly built their shelter...
28,00:01:07.10,00:01:07.10,I think I missed my calling in life as a lumberjack.
29,00:01:10.20,00:01:10.20,(sighs) That's... that's looking good right there.
30,00:01:13.73,00:01:13.73,(thunder crashing)
31,00:01:15.50,00:01:15.50,PROBST: ...while the women  were left out in the rain.
32,00:01:18.00,00:01:18.00,Forgot that we're in the middle of the Amazon
33,00:01:19.93,00:01:19.93,and that torrential rainstorms come by daily.
34,00:01:22.03,00:01:22.03,I can't believe how badly this sucks.
35,00:01:24.87,00:01:24.87,PROBST: The men discovered  the hazards of jungle life.
36,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33,Ow!
37,00:01:28.67,00:01:28.67,Damn it.
38,00:01:30.43,00:01:30.43,Ow! God!
39,00:01:33.90,00:01:33.90,PROBST:  And it appeared the women
40,00:01:35.27,00:01:35.27, might not be able  to survive at all.
41,00:01:37.17,00:01:37.17,"I'm just... I'm at the lowest of my low,"
42,00:01:39.50,00:01:39.50,and no one is respecting the fact that I am falling apart.
43,00:01:43.37,00:01:43.37,I'm having trouble walking.
44,00:01:45.30,00:01:45.30,(sniffles)
45,00:01:46.37,00:01:46.37, I'm just spent.
46,00:01:47.37,00:01:47.37,I don't think I've ever been this physically exhausted.
47,00:01:50.00,00:01:50.00,"PROBST: Despite the women's  problems at camp,"
48,00:01:51.77,00:01:51.77, they proved they could be  fierce competitors
49,00:01:53.93,00:01:53.93, and won four out of the first  five challenges.
50,00:01:57.23,00:01:57.23,Jaburu wins immunity!
51,00:01:59.40,00:01:59.40,"-Jaburu wins reward! -Yeah, baby!"
52,00:02:02.17,00:02:02.17,Jaburu wins reward.
53,00:02:03.80,00:02:03.80,"Immunity, Jaburu!"
54,00:02:06.30,00:02:06.30," But in the end, neither tribe  could escape Tribal Council,"
55,00:02:09.37,00:02:09.37, where two men...
56,00:02:11.73,00:02:11.73, and two women...
57,00:02:13.90,00:02:13.90, were voted out of the Amazon.
58,00:02:16.30,00:02:16.30," On day 13, Dave and Jenna went  on date night in the jungle."
59,00:02:21.07,00:02:21.07,"We were, like, ready to just, like, chat away."
60,00:02:24.23,00:02:24.23,"Heidi, who I've become"
61,00:02:25.73,00:02:25.73,"-really close to, which... -I expected that."
62,00:02:27.80,00:02:27.80,"PROBST: But the next day,  the game took a turn"
63,00:02:30.53,00:02:30.53, when they were forced  to pick new tribes.
64,00:02:32.60,00:02:32.60,DAVE:  Think she regretted saying
65,00:02:34.53,00:02:34.53,a lot of the information she did.
66,00:02:36.27,00:02:36.27,I've only heard good things about Heidi.
67,00:02:40.10,00:02:40.10,"PROBST:  Alex, Rob and Matthew"
68,00:02:42.10,00:02:42.10," went to Jaburu,  and Christy, Jeanne"
69,00:02:44.73,00:02:44.73," and Heidi went to Tambaqui,"
70,00:02:46.70,00:02:46.70, bringing tears for some...
71,00:02:48.60,00:02:48.60,"-I love you. -I love you, too."
72,00:02:51.10,00:02:51.10,"-Honey, we're home! -Oh, yeah!"
73,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70,PROBST:  ...and excitement for others.
74,00:02:55.17,00:02:55.17,"Boys come into the camp, and Shawna is 180 degrees better."
75,00:02:59.03,00:02:59.03,Hi!
76,00:03:00.97,00:03:00.97,I'm just really glad to be in a group
77,00:03:02.97,00:03:02.97,where this lantern is useful.
78,00:03:05.57,00:03:05.57,-Jaburu wins immunity! -(cheering)
79,00:03:07.97,00:03:07.97,"PROBST:  When Tambaqui lost immunity,"
80,00:03:09.77,00:03:09.77, Dave approached Heidi  to avoid a three-three tie.
81,00:03:12.43,00:03:12.43,"Like, if you were in my position,"
82,00:03:14.00,00:03:14.00,what do you think you would do?
83,00:03:15.43,00:03:15.43,I'd c... I'd come with us.
84,00:03:17.13,00:03:17.13,PROBST: So Heidi sided with  the men to vote out Jeanne.
85,00:03:21.33,00:03:21.33," At Jaburu, Rob and Deena  formed an unlikely alliance."
86,00:03:25.50,00:03:25.50,"ROB:  Deena is as hungry as I am,"
87,00:03:28.13,00:03:28.13,and she's the kind of person that nobody would suspect
88,00:03:30.67,00:03:30.67,I would have anything in common with.
89,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,"PROBST: Jaburu went  to the next Tribal Council,"
90,00:03:34.97,00:03:34.97, where the women sided  with the men.
91,00:03:37.60,00:03:37.60,Shawna.
92,00:03:38.27,00:03:38.27, And Shawna was voted out.
93,00:03:41.40,00:03:41.40," On day 19,  the two tribes merged,"
94,00:03:44.13,00:03:44.13, and Jacar\xc3\xa9 was born.
95,00:03:45.97,00:03:45.97,"Hey, here's to the new tribe, and here's to new friends."
96,00:03:49.03,00:03:49.03,-Yay! -Cheers!
97,00:03:50.60,00:03:50.60,PROBST:  The women appeared to be
98,00:03:51.80,00:03:51.80, outnumbered  and at a disadvantage.
99,00:03:54.07,00:03:54.07,ROGER: Our original game plan  was the six guys
100,00:03:56.40,00:03:56.40,"against the, uh... against the girls, and..."
101,00:03:59.60,00:03:59.60,"you know, it should be just, pick 'em off."
102,00:04:01.87,00:04:01.87,"PROBST: But a new alliance  composed of Rob,"
103,00:04:03.77,00:04:03.77," Deena, Alex, Heidi and Jenna"
104,00:04:06.47,00:04:06.47," blindsided Roger,  and then Dave,"
105,00:04:09.77,00:04:09.77, making him  the first member of the jury.
106,00:04:12.23,00:04:12.23,"It is not the battle of the sexes anymore,"
107,00:04:14.43,00:04:14.43,but it's the battle of the weaker versus the stronger.
108,00:04:17.30,00:04:17.30,PROBST:  Deena tried to get rid
109,00:04:19.10,00:04:19.10, -of her biggest threat.  -DEENA: Alex must go.
110,00:04:21.37,00:04:21.37,"Period, end of statement."
111,00:04:22.77,00:04:22.77,"PROBST:  But her plan backfired,"
112,00:04:24.03,00:04:24.03, and her own alliance  turned on her.
113,00:04:26.23,00:04:26.23,Ninth person voted out and the second member of our jury...
114,00:04:30.47,00:04:30.47," The foursome of Heidi,  Rob, Alex and Jenna"
115,00:04:33.40,00:04:33.40," were in control, until Alex  revealed his plan to Rob."
116,00:04:37.60,00:04:37.60,-The way I see it... -Mm-hmm.
117,00:04:39.70,00:04:39.70,"...if I win immunity, my vote goes for you."
118,00:04:44.93,00:04:44.93,PROBST: So Rob quickly formed  a new alliance.
119,00:04:47.77,00:04:47.77,"Me, you, Butch and Christy vote out Alex tomorrow."
120,00:04:49.80,00:04:49.80,That's what I was thinking.
121,00:04:51.23,00:04:51.23,I don't trust Alex anymore.
122,00:04:53.23,00:04:53.23,He's lied and changed his story a number of times.
123,00:04:56.23,00:04:56.23,"PROBST: After a stunned Alex  was voted out,"
124,00:04:58.43,00:04:58.43, Jenna and Heidi were furious at Rob's betrayal.
125,00:05:02.10,00:05:02.10,This is the point-- you don't care
126,00:05:03.57,00:05:03.57,about personal relationships; you just care about yourself.
127,00:05:05.37,00:05:05.37,I'm sorry I tried to keep myself in a majority
128,00:05:07.43,00:05:07.43,in a game where you vote people out.
129,00:05:09.23,00:05:09.23,But you're hurting people in the process.
130,00:05:10.73,00:05:10.73,PROBST: When Matthew  won the reward challenge...
131,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,Matthew wins reward!
132,00:05:14.53,00:05:14.53, ...he sacrificed a visit  from his mother...
133,00:05:16.53,00:05:16.53,Would you say it is better to give
134,00:05:18.47,00:05:18.47,-or to receive? -It is better to give.
135,00:05:20.57,00:05:20.57, ...so the rest of the tribe  could see their loved ones.
136,00:05:23.37,00:05:23.37,ROB:  After Matthew gave everybody
137,00:05:24.63,00:05:24.63," their visit from home,"
138,00:05:26.90,00:05:26.90, I'm beginning to seriously  doubt whether he's
139,00:05:28.73,00:05:28.73,"a beatable opponent anymore, and I may have"
140,00:05:31.13,00:05:31.13,to cut him off before the final two.
141,00:05:33.47,00:05:33.47,PROBST:  Christy was unsure how she
142,00:05:35.13,00:05:35.13, was going to vote  at Tribal Council.
143,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,You're still going to vote for Heidi tonight?
144,00:05:39.80,00:05:39.80,I guess so. I...
145,00:05:41.63,00:05:41.63,"-Guess so? -I-I... you know, I don't know."
146,00:05:44.53,00:05:44.53,The question is: who can I go farther with?
147,00:05:47.30,00:05:47.30,What can get me to be the sole Survivor?
148,00:05:49.63,00:05:49.63,PROBST:  And her ambivalence forced Rob
149,00:05:51.70,00:05:51.70, to change sides once again.
150,00:05:53.63,00:05:53.63,Would you just want to make this
151,00:05:54.93,00:05:54.93,really easy on everybody and vote out Christy tonight?
152,00:05:57.97,00:05:57.97,And you're willing to do that?
153,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,"PROBST:  So, at Tribal Council,"
154,00:06:01.53,00:06:01.53, Christy was the 11th person  voted out.
155,00:06:04.97,00:06:04.97,"-(howling) -PROBST: Last week,"
156,00:06:06.37,00:06:06.37, Matthew won  the reward challenge
157,00:06:07.83,00:06:07.83, and invited Rob  to a tailgate cookout.
158,00:06:10.43,00:06:10.43,"ROB: What do you want, a burger or hot dog first?"
159,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,MATTHEW: Hot dog.
160,00:06:14.03,00:06:14.03,I love hot dogs so much.
161,00:06:15.80,00:06:15.80,"Bon app\xc3\xa9tit, dude."
162,00:06:17.97,00:06:17.97,PROBST: And while the rest  of the tribe headed home...
163,00:06:21.97,00:06:21.97, ...an unattended fire  destroyed their camp.
164,00:06:30.27,00:06:30.27,"-HEIDI: Oh, my God. -JENNA: All my stuff."
165,00:06:33.53,00:06:33.53,All of our stuff-- everything we have is gone.
166,00:06:36.33,00:06:36.33,PROBST: And Jenna learned  her endurance has its limits.
167,00:06:38.93,00:06:38.93,(crying): I can't do this anymore. I feel like crap.
168,00:06:42.30,00:06:42.30,I hate every minute of being here.
169,00:06:46.53,00:06:46.53,PROBST:  After Matthew won immunity...
170,00:06:48.60,00:06:48.60,Matthew wins immunity!
171,00:06:50.37,00:06:50.37," ...the men forced  a sick Jenna to stay,"
172,00:06:53.00,00:06:53.00, and Heidi was the 12th person  voted out of the Amazon
173,00:06:55.83,00:06:55.83, and the fifth member  of the jury.
174,00:06:58.27,00:06:58.27,-Yep. -The tribe has spoken.
175,00:07:01.80,00:07:01.80, Only four remain:
176,00:07:03.53,00:07:03.53," Matthew, Jenna,"
177,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00, Butch and Rob.
178,00:07:08.33,00:07:08.33," Tonight, they will compete"
179,00:07:09.50,00:07:09.50, in their final  immunity challenges.
180,00:07:12.10,00:07:12.10, Two will advance  to face the jury.
181,00:07:13.97,00:07:13.97,One will outlast all the others and become the sole Survivor.
182,00:08:26.97,00:08:26.97,(thunder crashing)
183,00:08:40.77,00:08:40.77,-JENNA: I see embers. -MATTHEW: I-I got it.
184,00:08:45.00,00:08:45.00,Give me the dry stuff.
185,00:08:46.30,00:08:46.30,"ROB: Voting Heidi out  was a tough decision,"
186,00:08:49.20,00:08:49.20, but these last couple days  reminded me of a birthday card
187,00:08:52.73,00:08:52.73," that had a really hot girl on  the front, and inside it says,"
188,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,"""No matter how hot you think this girl is,"
189,00:08:57.80,00:08:57.80,"""somebody somewhere is sick and tired"
190,00:08:59.20,00:08:59.20,"of putting up with her crap."""
191,00:09:02.47,00:09:02.47,Can you give me some sticks?
192,00:09:03.77,00:09:03.77,-BUTCH: That... there they are. -Great.
193,00:09:05.00,00:09:05.00,BUTCH:  Final four--
194,00:09:06.63,00:09:06.63,"just like in college basketball  Final Four, it's big-time."
195,00:09:09.57,00:09:09.57," It's still miserable  conditions-- cold, wet--"
196,00:09:12.53,00:09:12.53,"but deep inside, you're just jumping with joy."
197,00:09:18.37,00:09:18.37,-JENNA: There you go. -MATTHEW: More sticks.
198,00:09:19.97,00:09:19.97,BUTCH: I've got some more on the way.
199,00:09:21.77,00:09:21.77,Here it comes. Got 'em?
200,00:09:22.93,00:09:22.93,Yep.

251,00:11:54.37,00:11:54.37, so we don't really have  to worry about it
252,00:11:55.97,00:11:55.97, and spend the last couple of  days just enjoying ourselves.
253,00:12:00.70,00:12:00.70,"MATTHEW: Butch, do a little dance."
254,00:12:02.03,00:12:02.03,"When I do that, I embarrass my family."

403,00:18:31.13,00:18:31.13,"JENNA: Oh, my God."
404,00:18:34.87,00:18:34.87,You don't know how bad I needed this.
405,00:18:39.03,00:18:39.03,"Jenna, come on up."
406,00:18:43.57,00:18:43.57,Nice work.
407,00:18:45.90,00:18:45.90,Anything can happen.
408,00:18:46.90,00:18:46.90,-Turn around. -That's true.
409,00:18:50.67,00:18:50.67,The very valuable immunity necklace...
410,00:18:52.90,00:18:52.90,-You have no idea. -...is yours.
411,00:18:55.17,00:18:55.17,You are safe from the vote tonight.
412,00:18:57.23,00:18:57.23,"The other three of you, fair game."
413,00:18:59.63,00:18:59.63,"Guys, head back, try and get dry."
414,00:19:01.63,00:19:01.63,I'll see you tonight at Tribal Council.
415,00:19:29.67,00:19:29.67,It's always a shock
416,00:19:31.03,00:19:31.03,when we get back to camp and it's still in one piece.
417,00:19:33.80,00:19:33.80,-Yeah. -(Jenna chuckles)
418,00:19:35.83,00:19:35.83,"ROB:  Butch, Matt and I"
419,00:19:37.77,00:19:37.77,"were going to be the final three of this game,"
420,00:19:40.30,00:19:40.30," and when Jenna won immunity,  it threw all that into chaos."
421,00:19:43.50,00:19:43.50,"JENNA: What did you have a problem with, Matt?"
422,00:19:45.47,00:19:45.47,"Um, I couldn't... my problem was..."
423,00:19:47.80,00:19:47.80,I was trying to find earth.
424,00:19:49.23,00:19:49.23,ROB: I've bitten  all my fingernails off.
425,00:19:52.10,00:19:52.10, I'm pacing around.
426,00:19:53.70,00:19:53.70," I don't know what exactly  I'm going to do yet,"
427,00:19:56.93,00:19:56.93,but it's a very scary time in the game for me.
428,00:19:59.70,00:19:59.70,"Yeah, I-I want to, uh, wash up a little bit."
429,00:20:03.40,00:20:03.40,You want us to wash any of your stuff?
430,00:20:05.97,00:20:05.97,"No, it's... I'm fine."
431,00:20:06.97,00:20:06.97,"These socks are kind of gross, though."
432,00:20:08.63,00:20:08.63,JENNA: It was so great  to win immunity.
433,00:20:10.30,00:20:10.30," I mean, I needed this to stay  in the game-- case closed."
434,00:20:13.03,00:20:13.03,And now they got to change their plan.
435,00:20:17.07,00:20:17.07,-You want to go down and do that? -Sure.
436,00:20:18.87,00:20:18.87,"Let's do it, dude. Might as well, and then we"
437,00:20:20.23,00:20:20.23,can come back and do the manioc.
438,00:20:21.30,00:20:21.30,MATTHEW:  I don't know
439,00:20:22.53,00:20:22.53, how Jenna feels  about who should go.
440,00:20:25.23,00:20:25.23, I really don't know how things  are going to unfold.
441,00:20:27.17,00:20:27.17,I anticipate that there are going to be
442,00:20:29.10,00:20:29.10,a lot of negotiations this evening.
443,00:20:35.47,00:20:35.47,"What's up, Butch?"
444,00:20:37.30,00:20:37.30,"Um, you got plans yet?"
445,00:20:38.70,00:20:38.70,You know I got to ask you.
446,00:20:39.93,00:20:39.93,I-I don't know what to do.
447,00:20:41.40,00:20:41.40,What do... what... I don't know
448,00:20:42.70,00:20:42.70,"what you guys had... uh, were thinking."
449,00:20:44.33,00:20:44.33,What are you thinking?
450,00:20:45.60,00:20:45.60,"Well, I guess... uh, I guess I'm not..."
451,00:20:49.33,00:20:49.33,I guess the only thing I have to say
452,00:20:51.23,00:20:51.23,"is, yeah, I'd like to be in the final three with you guys."
453,00:20:54.07,00:20:54.07,I... Okay.
454,00:20:55.53,00:20:55.53,"And I don't know, I'm just saying"
455,00:20:56.67,00:20:56.67,that this is what I'd like to do...
456,00:20:58.33,00:20:58.33,"I'd say they'll probably go for... you know, I don't know."
457,00:21:00.27,00:21:00.27,I have to get back and tell you.
458,00:21:01.73,00:21:01.73,"I'd say they're probably going to talk up, say, ""Well,"
459,00:21:03.33,00:21:03.33,"who are we going to get?"" And they'll probably say, ""Butch."""
460,00:21:05.00,00:21:05.00,MATTHEW: You'll... you'll let me know if she approaches you
461,00:21:07.17,00:21:07.17,"to say, ""Let's get rid of Matthew."""
462,00:21:08.83,00:21:08.83,"If she's going to vote for you,"
463,00:21:10.83,00:21:10.83,"then me and you just vote for Butch,"
464,00:21:12.67,00:21:12.67,"and Butch is going to vote for me, and Butch goes."
465,00:21:14.93,00:21:14.93,"Yeah, exactly."
466,00:21:16.83,00:21:16.83,"ROB: Matt and I went  through all the scenarios,"
467,00:21:19.93,00:21:19.93,"and basically, what I told Matt is that we need"
468,00:21:23.27,00:21:23.27," to vote for Butch,  and he agreed."
469,00:21:24.60,00:21:24.60,"I got so many things in my head now,"
470,00:21:26.20,00:21:26.20,"-I can't... -I know. Well,"
471,00:21:27.47,00:21:27.47,the only decision that... that has to happen...
472,00:21:29.17,00:21:29.17,"okay, Jenna decides she's going to vote..."
473,00:21:30.53,00:21:30.53,"she's going to vote for Butch,"
474,00:21:31.83,00:21:31.83,"all right, we vote for Butch, and it's done."
475,00:21:34.20,00:21:34.20,-Right. -Butch is gone. We go to the final three.
476,00:21:37.80,00:21:37.80,Who would you like to see go?
477,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,"Well, who would you like to see go? 'Cause I'm help..."
478,00:21:41.97,00:21:41.97,"you know, I'm asking you for your help."
479,00:21:44.50,00:21:44.50,"Well, probably the person who dogged me."
480,00:21:46.17,00:21:46.17,Probably Rob.
481,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50,You've never done anything to me.
482,00:21:48.67,00:21:48.67,-Right. -Matt's never done anything to me.
483,00:21:50.17,00:21:50.17,"The only person who screwed me royally was Rob, and that's"
484,00:21:52.83,00:21:52.83,"-the only thing I can go on. -Yeah. Well, if you would"
485,00:21:54.50,00:21:54.50,"stand by that, I would, uh... I would really appreciate it."
486,00:21:56.53,00:21:56.53,"No, no, that's what I... that's where we're at now."
487,00:21:58.47,00:21:58.47,"I appreciate the... you-you know, here I am asking you..."
488,00:22:01.90,00:22:01.90,-And I... I said that's fine. -21... a 50-year-old guy asking
489,00:22:03.37,00:22:03.37,"-a 21-year-old girl. -Hey, the youngest and the oldest"
490,00:22:04.77,00:22:04.77,-sticking together. -Youngest... isn't that neat--
491,00:22:05.93,00:22:05.93,"the youngest and the oldest, huh?"
492,00:22:06.93,00:22:06.93,That's... that's really neat.
493,00:22:07.93,00:22:07.93,"Okay. Hey, I'm excited now."
494,00:22:09.53,00:22:09.53,I-I-I'm really excited.
495,00:22:11.27,00:22:11.27,"Yeah, don't be nervous. I'm for you."
496,00:22:13.37,00:22:13.37,All right.
497,00:22:17.97,00:22:17.97,"ROB: You know, don't... don't screw me over here, Matt."
498,00:22:20.00,00:22:20.00,"-No, I know. I'd like to... -Don't... It's-it's your call."
499,00:22:22.73,00:22:22.73,"Well, like I said, I'm telling you honestly"
500,00:22:25.47,00:22:25.47,and upfront as I have throughout the game
501,00:22:27.17,00:22:27.17,that I'm going to do my best to make a plan
502,00:22:29.60,00:22:29.60,-that has our best interests in mind. -Mm-hmm.
503,00:22:31.33,00:22:31.33,MATTHEW:  Rob is in real trouble.
504,00:22:33.47,00:22:33.47, He doesn't have a great  relationship with Jenna.
505,00:22:36.60,00:22:36.60, He doesn't have  any relationship with Butch.
506,00:22:39.10,00:22:39.10,His only real relationship in this game is with yours truly.
507,00:22:42.77,00:22:42.77, So I'm the only guy
508,00:22:44.20,00:22:44.20," who can really, uh,  keep him going in this game."
509,00:22:46.80,00:22:46.80,Trust me.
510,00:22:48.07,00:22:48.07,"And I'm... I'm going to, um..."
511,00:22:49.30,00:22:49.30,"I'm going to do my best to speak to her today,"
512,00:22:51.17,00:22:51.17,-and I'm gonna work that deal. -And I appreciate that.
513,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,"MATTHEW: I know that Rob, you know,"
514,00:23:14.63,00:23:14.63,-is a bigger threat. -Screwed me.
515,00:23:15.97,00:23:15.97,"-You know, and he also screwed you. -Right."
516,00:23:17.77,00:23:17.77,"Um, when I think about it, who really"
517,00:23:19.87,00:23:19.87,"-deserves it, you know, and... and I... -Right."
518,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,"you know, Butch hasn't screwed anyone..."
519,00:23:22.10,00:23:22.10,"JENNA: No, but he hasn't worked."
520,00:23:23.43,00:23:23.43,-...but Butch hasn't done anything. -I know.
521,00:23:25.07,00:23:25.07,-I just don't think he deserves to be there. -Right.
522,00:23:27.70,00:23:27.70,Rob has played the damn game.
523,00:23:28.90,00:23:28.90,"Yeah, he's-he's betrayed a lot of people,"
524,00:23:30.33,00:23:30.33,-and you know what? -Whatever.
525,00:23:32.03,00:23:32.03,-Both of us have a pretty decent shot. -Right.
526,00:23:33.73,00:23:33.73,-Because he's ... so many people over. -Right.
527,00:23:35.13,00:23:35.13,"-You know, and I'm cool about it. -Mm-hmm."
528,00:23:37.27,00:23:37.27,And that's the one thing that I have going for me now
529,00:23:39.03,00:23:39.03,-is I haven't screwed anyone. -Right. Right.
530,00:23:40.40,00:23:40.40,"You know, I haven't lied to anyone."
531,00:23:41.77,00:23:41.77,I haven't stabbed anyone in the back...
532,00:23:43.23,00:23:43.23,-stabbed anyone in the back. -No. That's true.
533,00:23:44.57,00:23:44.57,So how do you feel about a secret alliance
534,00:23:50.70,00:23:50.70,based on a shared voting strategy this evening?
535,00:23:56.80,00:23:56.80,Okay.
536,00:23:57.80,00:23:57.80,"During tomorrow's immunity challenge,"
537,00:24:00.13,00:24:00.13,-and if I won... -Mm-hmm.
538,00:24:01.77,00:24:01.77,"...or if you won, we would select the other person."
539,00:24:03.83,00:24:03.83,"JENNA: Matt comes up to me  and said that, you know,"
540,00:24:06.10,00:24:06.10," ""I promise you  that I will take you"
541,00:24:07.73,00:24:07.73," to the final two  if I win immunity."""
542,00:24:09.37,00:24:09.37," It's a strategical move  on my part,"
543,00:24:11.50,00:24:11.50,"but people could still, you know, lie."
544,00:24:14.33,00:24:14.33,"I mean, Matt could take Rob, and that's fine,"
545,00:24:16.20,00:24:16.20,but he has to remember that I'm on the jury then
546,00:24:18.47,00:24:18.47,and he stabbed me in the back.
547,00:24:19.97,00:24:19.97,"-Okay, I swear on everything. -And-and we'll shake on it"
548,00:24:21.90,00:24:21.90,-right now before they come back. -Yeah.
549,00:24:23.40,00:24:23.40,JENNA: Okay. I will vote for Butch tonight.
550,00:24:24.60,00:24:24.60,Okay. And I'm sure Rob will do the same.
551,00:24:27.07,00:24:27.07,"MATTHEW: If I win tomorrow's  immunity challenge,"
552,00:24:30.33,00:24:30.33, I will take her  to the final two.
553,00:24:32.43,00:24:32.43," Now, I will either"
554,00:24:34.40,00:24:34.40,"honor that secret alliance, or..."
555,00:24:39.40,00:24:39.40,do some backstabbing.
556,00:24:47.80,00:24:47.80,"JENNA: Butch doesn't want  to vote for Matt,"
557,00:24:49.87,00:24:49.87," Rob doesn't want to vote  for Matt,"
558,00:24:51.37,00:24:51.37,"so I have an opportunity to... to kick off someone like Butch,"
559,00:24:53.87,00:24:53.87," who I don't feel has done  any work to get here, or Rob."
560,00:24:57.57,00:24:57.57,"You know, I could get him back for what he did to me."
561,00:25:49.23,00:25:49.23,Now bring in the members of our jury--
562,00:25:51.17,00:25:51.17,"Dave, Deena, Alex,"
563,00:25:54.43,00:25:54.43,Christy and Heidi.
564,00:26:06.97,00:26:06.97,37 days.
565,00:26:09.23,00:26:09.23,"Butch, you just ducked your head when I said that."
566,00:26:11.93,00:26:11.93,Just exhaust you hearing it?
567,00:26:13.50,00:26:13.50,It's-it's a... it's a wonderful feeling-- 37 days.
568,00:26:16.27,00:26:16.27,"Um, for me, personally, um,"
569,00:26:19.00,00:26:19.00,"I feel I've accomplished more than what, uh,"
570,00:26:21.67,00:26:21.67,I've ever dreamed about accomplishing.
571,00:26:23.90,00:26:23.90,"Um, it's been a wonderful experience."
572,00:26:24.97,00:26:24.97,PROBST: How do you think you got here?
573,00:26:26.53,00:26:26.53,How did you outlast 12 other people?
574,00:26:28.90,00:26:28.90,I didn't make a lot of loud and noisy comments
575,00:26:31.60,00:26:31.60,and didn't cut anybody down.
576,00:26:32.93,00:26:32.93,I was very positive with everybody.
577,00:26:34.43,00:26:34.43,I looked for the good in a person
578,00:26:36.07,00:26:36.07,"and tried to, um, utilize that."
579,00:26:39.50,00:26:39.50,"Matthew, how'd you end up here?"
580,00:26:41.13,00:26:41.13,"Well, I had a very multifaceted strategy,"
581,00:26:43.70,00:26:43.70,"uh, based on honesty and versatility."
582,00:26:46.80,00:26:46.80,"Tried to be smart, um, tried to be intelligent,"
583,00:26:50.40,00:26:50.40,"and again, above all,"
584,00:26:51.93,00:26:51.93,tried to maintain my honesty and my integrity
585,00:26:54.13,00:26:54.13,so that people would trust me.
586,00:26:56.20,00:26:56.20,"Rob, how did you end up in this final four?"
587,00:26:59.03,00:26:59.03,I've been asking myself that question all day.
588,00:27:01.53,00:27:01.53,"I've been very fortunate, I think."
589,00:27:03.87,00:27:03.87,"Most of the time, when I..."
590,00:27:05.23,00:27:05.23,"when I've zigged, I should have zigged."
591,00:27:06.87,00:27:06.87,"Most of the time, when I zagged, I should have zagged."
592,00:27:09.13,00:27:09.13,"And I've been very, very lucky that I have taken"
593,00:27:12.80,00:27:12.80,a lot of risks in this game
594,00:27:14.17,00:27:14.17,and they've mostly paid off to this point.
595,00:27:16.43,00:27:16.43,"PROBST: Jenna, there have been times"
596,00:27:18.00,00:27:18.00,"where I thought you were going to throw your hands up and say,"
597,00:27:21.13,00:27:21.13,"""You know what? Had enough. Get me out of here,"""
598,00:27:23.97,00:27:23.97,"try and engineer a quit, and yet,"
599,00:27:25.83,00:27:25.83,"not only are you in the final four,"
600,00:27:27.33,00:27:27.33,you're sitting with immunity around your neck.
601,00:27:28.83,00:27:28.83,"Yeah, I mean, uh,"
602,00:27:30.27,00:27:30.27,"I've had really high highs and really low lows,"
603,00:27:32.47,00:27:32.47,"and there were times where I wanted to quit,"
604,00:27:34.73,00:27:34.73,"but then I said, ""God,"
605,00:27:36.27,00:27:36.27,"I'm just going to kick myself if I do that."""
606,00:27:38.53,00:27:38.53,"I've never needed immunity more than I needed it today,"
607,00:27:41.40,00:27:41.40,so I just... I fought hard for it.
608,00:27:43.57,00:27:43.57,"Rob, how important was that immunity today,"
609,00:27:46.07,00:27:46.07,and how badly did you want it?
610,00:27:47.83,00:27:47.83,"Well, we're down to four people,"
611,00:27:50.03,00:27:50.03,"and one person's going to go home,"
612,00:27:52.33,00:27:52.33,and the person that wears the immunity necklace
613,00:27:55.50,00:27:55.50,"can't be that person, so it's pretty damn important"
614,00:27:57.87,00:27:57.87,at this... at this stage in the game.
615,00:27:59.27,00:27:59.27,"Jenna, so as you sit there with immunity around your neck"
616,00:28:02.27,00:28:02.27,"and you go back to camp,"
617,00:28:03.80,00:28:03.80,had to be a pretty interesting afternoon.
618,00:28:06.37,00:28:06.37,Did all of these guys approach you at one time or another
619,00:28:08.57,00:28:08.57,"and say, ""Jenna, let me talk to you?"""
620,00:28:10.03,00:28:10.03,"I-I've talked to all of them, because obviously there..."
621,00:28:12.67,00:28:12.67,it was a big game switch.
622,00:28:13.77,00:28:13.77,"Obviously, I was probably the next to go."
623,00:28:15.90,00:28:15.90,"So I-I've spoken to all of them, yeah."
624,00:28:18.63,00:28:18.63,Tell me about that feeling to be in the catbird seat.
625,00:28:21.20,00:28:21.20,It's different right now for me to feel like...
626,00:28:23.50,00:28:23.50,"like I'm... you know, have a little bit of control"
627,00:28:26.10,00:28:26.10,considering the last three or whatever days
628,00:28:29.00,00:28:29.00,"I have had none, so... basically,"
629,00:28:31.83,00:28:31.83,"and it's a good feeling-- it's good to feel like,"
630,00:28:33.80,00:28:33.80,"you know, you can make an important decision,"
631,00:28:36.00,00:28:36.00,and it's a big deal to have immunity
632,00:28:38.00,00:28:38.00,at this point in time in the game.
633,00:28:39.27,00:28:39.27,"Butch, as you sit here about to vote,"
634,00:28:41.27,00:28:41.27,what's it going to be based on?
635,00:28:42.57,00:28:42.57,Strategy.
636,00:28:43.90,00:28:43.90,Trying to stay in the game.
637,00:28:45.47,00:28:45.47,PROBST: Did you hustle today
638,00:28:46.80,00:28:46.80,to try and make sure you could stay in?
639,00:28:48.33,00:28:48.33,"Um, I want to assure you, I hustled today,"
640,00:28:50.63,00:28:50.63,"and, um, I tried... I'm trying to stay in the game, yes."
641,00:28:53.93,00:28:53.93,"PROBST: Rob, what kind of maneuvering"
642,00:28:55.27,00:28:55.27,did you try to do today
643,00:28:56.60,00:28:56.60,"to, uh, get on Jenna's good side?"
644,00:28:58.50,00:28:58.50,"Uh, I tried to make Jenna lunch this afternoon."
645,00:29:02.93,00:29:02.93,I told her that she looked beautiful today.
646,00:29:05.83,00:29:05.83,"But, seriously, I don't think"
647,00:29:08.93,00:29:08.93,that anything you can do after somebody wins immunity
648,00:29:11.77,00:29:11.77,is going to change their mind.
649,00:29:13.17,00:29:13.17,I think it has to do with what you did
650,00:29:15.97,00:29:15.97,before they had that power in the game.
651,00:29:18.23,00:29:18.23,"And, uh, we'll see what happens here tonight."
652,00:29:20.53,00:29:20.53,"On that note, it is time to vote."
653,00:29:22.97,00:29:22.97,"Rob, you're up."
654,00:29:37.00,00:29:37.00,I don't think all the firewood
655,00:29:39.43,00:29:39.43," in the forest is going to keep  your torch lit tonight, buddy."
656,00:29:42.60,00:29:42.60,Nice game.
657,00:29:56.47,00:29:56.47,"Rob, I want to wish you the very best."
658,00:29:58.20,00:29:58.20,You're a real good kid.
659,00:30:22.43,00:30:22.43,I'll go tally the votes.
660,00:30:34.70,00:30:34.70,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
661,00:30:37.10,00:30:37.10,Person voted out will be asked to leave
662,00:30:38.67,00:30:38.67,the Tribal Council area immediately.
663,00:30:40.30,00:30:40.30,I'll read the votes.
664,00:30:42.90,00:30:42.90,First vote.
665,00:30:46.47,00:30:46.47,Butch.
666,00:30:52.40,00:30:52.40,Rob.
667,00:30:53.50,00:30:53.50,"One vote-- Rob, one vote-- Butch."
668,00:31:00.73,00:31:00.73,Butch.
669,00:31:01.87,00:31:01.87,"Two votes Butch, one vote Rob."
670,00:31:07.17,00:31:07.17,Last vote.
671,00:31:15.87,00:31:15.87,Butch.
672,00:31:17.17,00:31:17.17,"That's it, Butch. You need to bring me your torch."
673,00:31:21.67,00:31:21.67,-Good luck. -Good luck.
674,00:31:23.03,00:31:23.03,"Guys, bl-bless you."
675,00:31:25.23,00:31:25.23,"I mean it, all right?"
676,00:31:31.73,00:31:31.73,"Butch, the tribe has spoken."
677,00:31:39.60,00:31:39.60,-It's time for you to go. -Good luck.
678,00:31:41.40,00:31:41.40,"-Bye, Butch. -Bye, Butch."
679,00:32:01.47,00:32:01.47,"PROBST: Well, today's immunity challenge"
680,00:32:03.17,00:32:03.17,and tonight's Tribal Council clearly showed
681,00:32:05.27,00:32:05.27,the value of immunity and how quickly
682,00:32:07.27,00:32:07.27,it can change the course of the game for the person who has it.
683,00:32:10.43,00:32:10.43,"You have one immunity challenge left, and it's the biggest."
684,00:32:13.13,00:32:13.13,Guarantees you a spot in the final two
685,00:32:15.07,00:32:15.07,and the right to decide
686,00:32:16.70,00:32:16.70,who goes to the final Tribal Council with you.
687,00:32:20.03,00:32:20.03,Big day tomorrow. Head back to camp.
688,00:32:22.20,00:32:22.20,Good night.
689,00:32:27.43,00:32:27.43,I just experienced an adventure of a lifetime.
690,00:32:31.13,00:32:31.13, I will never forget  these 37 days.
691,00:32:33.10,00:32:33.10, I feel I played the game hard  and I played it well.
692,00:32:35.73,00:32:35.73, The sign that I took--
693,00:32:37.17,00:32:37.17," I mean it when I say,"
694,00:32:38.47,00:32:38.47,"""Believe in yourself."""
695,00:32:39.77,00:32:39.77,You can do things if you go out and set your goals
696,00:32:42.93,00:32:42.93,and have your dreams and then go out and do them.
697,00:32:45.40,00:32:45.40,Look at me. I made it through Survivor.
698,00:33:11.87,00:33:11.87,"Man, is there anything we... we can do about moths?"
699,00:33:15.00,00:33:15.00,"They're, like, killer moths. They're, like, biting."
700,00:33:20.80,00:33:20.80,ROB: After we thought  the worst was over
701,00:33:24.03,00:33:24.03,"between the rain and getting finally dry,"
702,00:33:27.47,00:33:27.47," we were attacked by moths,  and they just wanted to crash"
703,00:33:32.37,00:33:32.37, right into us  like kamikaze moths.
704,00:33:34.93,00:33:34.93, I don't know where  they all came from.
705,00:33:37.13,00:33:37.13,"I hadn't seen one moth in 37 days, but last night,"
706,00:33:40.27,00:33:40.27, moths were just everywhere.
707,00:33:41.53,00:33:41.53,There do seem to be a lot of them.
708,00:33:43.87,00:33:43.87,"-They're crazy. -JENNA: Yeah, they're, like, dive-bombing."
709,00:34:05.30,00:34:05.30,"ROB: Um, by my estimates,"
710,00:34:06.83,00:34:06.83,I would imagine that each of us will get about...
711,00:34:09.83,00:34:09.83,between 16 to 17 manioc patties.
712,00:34:13.30,00:34:13.30,JENNA: Yes! This is the best day of my life!
713,00:34:15.30,00:34:15.30,Babassu nuts out the ass.
714,00:34:17.60,00:34:17.60,-ROB: Yep. -And manioc.
715,00:34:19.33,00:34:19.33,"When we woke up this morning,"
716,00:34:20.80,00:34:20.80,we decided to have the biggest breakfast
717,00:34:23.17,00:34:23.17, of our 38 days  out in the jungle.
718,00:34:26.23,00:34:26.23,"MATTHEW: You guys, this is going to be the most babassu"
719,00:34:28.17,00:34:28.17,we've had to date.
720,00:34:29.33,00:34:29.33,This is going to be the most manioc
721,00:34:30.77,00:34:30.77,-we've had to date. -This is going to be great.
722,00:34:31.83,00:34:31.83,MATTHEW: Big meal for a big day.
723,00:34:33.97,00:34:33.97,"-JENNA: Very good, Rob. -Mm-hmm."
724,00:34:41.63,00:34:41.63,JENNA: Maybe the treemail will be a candy bar.
725,00:34:44.40,00:34:44.40,ROB: You say that every time.
726,00:34:45.73,00:34:45.73,-I know. -What's that?
727,00:34:47.43,00:34:47.43,-He can read it. -It's something that should be...
728,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,Mr. Treemail Man's got one last thing to tell us.
729,00:34:52.03,00:34:52.03,Let's each put our arm on this.
730,00:34:56.57,00:34:56.57,-Guys ready? -The final time.
731,00:34:58.23,00:34:58.23,"MATTHEW: One, two, three."
732,00:35:00.83,00:35:00.83,All right. Let's switch lines.
733,00:35:04.47,00:35:04.47,"MATTHEW: ""It's not a challenge."
734,00:35:06.03,00:35:06.03,"ROB: ""Just fun to do."
735,00:35:07.30,00:35:07.30,"JENNA: ""So step on up."
736,00:35:08.50,00:35:08.50,"MATTHEW: See what's left of you."""
737,00:35:10.30,00:35:10.30,It's a scale.
738,00:35:13.53,00:35:13.53,Whoa.
739,00:35:14.97,00:35:14.97,-(Jenna laughing) -MATTHEW: So...
740,00:35:16.60,00:35:16.60,"Hey, let's go take it back to camp."
741,00:35:17.90,00:35:17.90,JENNA: Let's take it back to camp.
742,00:35:19.23,00:35:19.23,"I thought they meant, ""See what's"
743,00:35:20.37,00:35:20.37,"left of you,"" and I looked left."
744,00:35:21.63,00:35:21.63,"ROB: What, so you were looking off to the left?"
745,00:35:23.87,00:35:23.87,"Yeah, I thought they meant, like,"
746,00:35:25.07,00:35:25.07,there'd be something waiting for us.
747,00:35:26.27,00:35:26.27,-You're crazy. -(Jenna laughs)
748,00:35:27.73,00:35:27.73,"When it says... when... when somebody tells you,"
749,00:35:29.23,00:35:29.23,"""That's right,"" do you turn to your right?"
750,00:35:31.00,00:35:31.00,"JENNA: No, but I don't know."
751,00:35:33.23,00:35:33.23," ROB: We just got a gift  from the treemail gods,"
752,00:35:36.30,00:35:36.30,and we got a scale so we could weigh ourselves.
753,00:35:39.00,00:35:39.00,And we've all been dying to know just how much we weigh.
754,00:35:41.93,00:35:41.93,MATTHEW: Does it say 63?
755,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90,JENNA: Looks like 64.
756,00:35:46.13,00:35:46.13,64. So I went from 80 to 64.
757,00:35:49.47,00:35:49.47,-JENNA: Wow. -Which is 16 kilos.
758,00:35:53.47,00:35:53.47,JENNA: So... and that all means what?
759,00:35:54.73,00:35:54.73,"-Uh, you got to do the math. -2.2 kilos to one pound."
760,00:35:56.87,00:35:56.87,This is too much work.
761,00:35:58.43,00:35:58.43,"MATTHEW: The scale was in kilos,  and one kilo is 2.2 pounds,"
762,00:36:02.77,00:36:02.77, so I weighed myself in kilos  and converted back to pounds.
763,00:36:06.47,00:36:06.47, I realized that my weight
764,00:36:07.87,00:36:07.87,"has gone from 173 to 148,"
765,00:36:11.87,00:36:11.87," and if I've lost 28 pounds,  I think that I have lost"
766,00:36:14.60,00:36:14.60," most of the fat  on my body and that,"
767,00:36:17.30,00:36:17.30," um, I'm right now  losing muscle."
768,00:36:19.40,00:36:19.40,-Well... -You-you go fir... You go next.
769,00:36:22.83,00:36:22.83,JENNA: You're at 60.
770,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"ROB: Yeah, I weigh 60 kilos, so..."
771,00:36:26.57,00:36:26.57,"according to this, I weigh about 130 pounds,"
772,00:36:29.57,00:36:29.57,but I don't think that that's correct.
773,00:36:31.90,00:36:31.90,"-(Jenna laughs) -ROB: Basically,"
774,00:36:33.90,00:36:33.90,"over the last 38 days, my body has just"
775,00:36:36.50,00:36:36.50,deteriorated and... and turned against itself.
776,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20," I mean, I've lost almost  a pound a day for 38 days."
777,00:36:43.13,00:36:43.13,"60 kilos. Let me, uh, get a pen."
778,00:36:46.20,00:36:46.20,MATTHEW: What did you start out at?
779,00:36:47.73,00:36:47.73,"I came into this game at about 170 pounds,"
780,00:36:49.93,00:36:49.93,"and I think I weigh around, like, 138 pounds right now,"
781,00:36:52.90,00:36:52.90,which is ridiculous.
782,00:36:57.30,00:36:57.30,"Okay, I weigh 46 kilos."
783,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,MATTHEW: 46 kilos times 2.2 pounds per kilo.
784,00:37:04.83,00:37:04.83,"JENNA:  I started at 118 pounds,"
785,00:37:07.30,00:37:07.30,"and I weigh 99, so that is a lot of weight to lose."
786,00:37:10.53,00:37:10.53,"Yeah, I think... don't think this is right."
787,00:37:12.03,00:37:12.03,"JENNA: Well, how do you think...? What about mine?"
788,00:37:14.00,00:37:14.00,So what's the difference in kilos?
789,00:37:15.43,00:37:15.43,"JENNA: I-I weigh 45 kilos,"
790,00:37:17.77,00:37:17.77,and I started at 118 pounds.
791,00:37:20.47,00:37:20.47,"That's not good to lose that much weight,"
792,00:37:22.47,00:37:22.47,"but then again, it'll be really fun to gain it all back."
793,00:37:30.80,00:37:30.80,That amounts to about...
794,00:37:33.13,00:37:33.13,"What's up, guys?"
795,00:37:34.37,00:37:34.37,What's going on?
796,00:37:35.77,00:37:35.77,"-Come on... come on in. -JENNA: Jeff came into camp,"
797,00:37:37.70,00:37:37.70," and he's like,  ""What's up, guys?"""
798,00:37:39.87,00:37:39.87," I was like,  ""Whoa. What is going on?"""
799,00:37:41.47,00:37:41.47," I thought I was in, like,  a dreamland."
800,00:37:43.00,00:37:43.00,Okay. 38 days.
801,00:37:46.03,00:37:46.03,You're telling us.
802,00:37:47.50,00:37:47.50,"PROBST: You've been surviving in the Amazon,"
803,00:37:49.17,00:37:49.17,"living off this land,"
804,00:37:50.80,00:37:50.80,"utilizing its resources when you were able to,"
805,00:37:53.23,00:37:53.23,definitely fighting the elements
806,00:37:54.87,00:37:54.87,-when you had to. -Yeah. -Mm-hmm.
807,00:37:56.77,00:37:56.77,"So I thought it might be fun,"
808,00:37:58.57,00:37:58.57,"since this time is almost over,"
809,00:37:59.97,00:37:59.97,to take one last look at the Amazon
810,00:38:02.03,00:38:02.03,from a slightly different view-- from up above.
811,00:38:04.70,00:38:04.70,"-JENNA: Oh... -Oh, sweet."
812,00:38:06.10,00:38:06.10,PROBST: So we have a seaplane ride scheduled for you.
813,00:38:08.77,00:38:08.77,"Give you an aerial tour of this area you've been calling home,"
814,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,and I suggest-- if you can-- to put the game on hold
815,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,for a few minutes and take it in.
816,00:38:16.87,00:38:16.87,Really take it in.
817,00:38:18.23,00:38:18.23,You're never coming back here again.
818,00:38:19.77,00:38:19.77,"When the ride is over, the pilot will drop you off"
819,00:38:22.33,00:38:22.33,"at a new canoe, smaller than the boat you already have."
820,00:38:25.63,00:38:25.63,"You'll take this map. I'll give it to you, Jenna."
821,00:38:27.80,00:38:27.80,Thank you.
822,00:38:28.80,00:38:28.80,PROBST: Follow this map to your new destination.
823,00:38:30.93,00:38:30.93," You will find beads,  paints, feathers"
824,00:38:34.47,00:38:34.47, and one headdress
825,00:38:36.00,00:38:36.00,-for each of you. -(chuckling)
826,00:38:37.37,00:38:37.37,You're going to decorate
827,00:38:38.67,00:38:38.67,and adorn your body just like Amazon warriors did
828,00:38:41.73,00:38:41.73,when they prepared for battle
829,00:38:43.00,00:38:43.00,"because, in a sense, that is what you are doing."
830,00:38:45.20,00:38:45.20,You are preparing for your final immunity challenge.
831,00:38:48.80,00:38:48.80,"When you're done, you will get in your new boat"
832,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,and you will head to Tribal Council.
833,00:38:52.90,00:38:52.90,"-Sounds awesome. -Right on, guys."
834,00:38:54.17,00:38:54.17,"-We'll see you tonight, Jeff. -Bye."
835,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43,-I'll see you tonight. -Thanks for stopping by.
836,00:38:57.00,00:38:57.00,Thanks a lot.
837,00:38:58.00,00:38:58.00,MATTHEW: This opportunity  to take a ride in a seaplane
838,00:39:00.13,00:39:00.13, and go above the canopy  and see a lot
839,00:39:01.77,00:39:01.77,of the surroundings that really are inaccessible to us
840,00:39:04.30,00:39:04.30,"was just, uh... just amazing."
841,00:39:06.40,00:39:06.40, And we all were so excited  and so happy.
842,00:39:10.60,00:39:10.60, It really felt like a reward
843,00:39:12.17,00:39:12.17, for all the time  that we'd spent here.
844,00:39:14.87,00:39:14.87," We paddled up to the seaplane,  climbed in, and..."
845,00:39:19.40,00:39:19.40,we were off. We were gone.
846,00:39:50.50,00:39:50.50,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
847,00:40:20.53,00:40:20.53, JENNA: It's hard to...  to... to really grasp
848,00:40:24.20,00:40:24.20, how large the Amazon is  and how beautiful it is.
849,00:40:26.27,00:40:26.27, It's unbelievable.
850,00:40:27.83,00:40:27.83,"It's really something everybody  should try to experience,"
851,00:40:29.87,00:40:29.87," you know, once in their life."
852,00:40:31.83,00:40:31.83,"MATTHEW: We saw rolling  green carpets of jungle,"
853,00:40:36.53,00:40:36.53,and it was such an exhilarating  feeling to...
854,00:40:38.87,00:40:38.87, to... to get away from camp
855,00:40:40.33,00:40:40.33, and to... to take in  the surroundings from...
856,00:40:43.90,00:40:43.90,"from a seaplane from high above  the, uh, jungle floor."
857,00:40:47.37,00:40:47.37," Uh, difficult to describe  in words."
858,00:40:50.43,00:40:50.43,ROB: For us to have  that opportunity
859,00:40:52.07,00:40:52.07,"was really a, uh... a nice time  and a chance to enjoy the..."
860,00:40:56.17,00:40:56.17," you know, the amazing scenery"
861,00:40:57.90,00:40:57.90, that we've been  a part of down here.
862,00:40:59.73,00:40:59.73," But under the surface, the game is still being played,"
863,00:41:04.33,00:41:04.33," and there certainly  is strategy going on,"
864,00:41:06.40,00:41:06.40, and this game  is pretty far from over.
865,00:41:19.33,00:41:19.33,"MATTHEW:  After our plane flight,"
866,00:41:21.40,00:41:21.40, we boarded a small canoe  and navigated through a...
867,00:41:25.60,00:41:25.60, a weed-choked river  to a small hut.
868,00:41:32.37,00:41:32.37,Wow.
869,00:41:33.60,00:41:33.60,What are these?  I wonder how these are worn.
870,00:41:35.67,00:41:35.67,This is so cool. I want this around my neck.
871,00:41:38.40,00:41:38.40,"And what's this, like, some sort of crotch protector?"
872,00:41:40.70,00:41:40.70,ROB: I-I don't think it's a cup-- I'm pretty sure.
873,00:41:42.70,00:41:42.70,"JENNA: I think that's a little small to be a cup there, cowboy."
874,00:41:45.33,00:41:45.33,Yeah. Cowboy.
875,00:41:46.93,00:41:46.93,"JENNA: We had all this jewelry  and beads in there,"
876,00:41:49.00,00:41:49.00," really cool stuff, and...  and flowers"
877,00:41:50.43,00:41:50.43, that we just put everywhere
878,00:41:51.87,00:41:51.87, and really decorated ourselves  really cool and...
879,00:41:54.10,00:41:54.10,"started to just, like, go crazy and paint each other's faces."
880,00:42:18.10,00:42:18.10,"Yeah, okay."
881,00:42:19.37,00:42:19.37,That looks cool.
882,00:42:20.70,00:42:20.70,"ROB:  Right now, I don't know"
883,00:42:22.70,00:42:22.70, what the immunity challenge  is going to be.
884,00:42:24.73,00:42:24.73, All I know  is it's the most important
885,00:42:27.23,00:42:27.23," immunity challenge  of this game,"
886,00:42:28.77,00:42:28.77, so I'm preparing  for everything:
887,00:42:30.07,00:42:30.07," mental, physical, anything."
888,00:42:31.57,00:42:31.57, This one could cost me  a million dollars
889,00:42:34.93,00:42:34.93, if I'm not successful  here today.
890,00:42:36.90,00:42:36.90,Let me see.
891,00:42:38.27,00:42:38.27,MATTHEW: If Jenna or Rob  won the immunity challenge
892,00:42:42.37,00:42:42.37," and picked me,  I wouldn't have to vote"
893,00:42:44.27,00:42:44.27, against the...  the third person.
894,00:42:46.07,00:42:46.07, That third person  would most likely favor me
895,00:42:50.47,00:42:50.47, over the person  who voted them out.
896,00:42:52.23,00:42:52.23, It could be a wise strategic move for me to lose on purpose.
897,00:42:58.30,00:42:58.30,Watch the makeup.
898,00:42:59.97,00:42:59.97,JENNA: It's time for the serious  players to be in the game.
899,00:43:02.07,00:43:02.07, I really have worked hard  to get here.
900,00:43:04.03,00:43:04.03,"Happy, happy, happy."
901,00:43:05.30,00:43:05.30,Don't... j-just don't let it go...
902,00:43:07.13,00:43:07.13, I don't know who I could beat  in the final two.
903,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80, I don't know  what the jury's thinking.
904,00:43:10.03,00:43:10.03,-How's that? -Good.
905,00:43:11.30,00:43:11.30,"Rob burned me, he burned Heidi,  he burned Alex,"
906,00:43:14.17,00:43:14.17," he burned our whole alliance,"
907,00:43:15.60,00:43:15.60," and he-he may be the one  easier to beat,"
908,00:43:17.93,00:43:17.93," but it's out of my hands  after the immunity challenge,"
909,00:43:21.03,00:43:21.03, so I'm not going to stress  over it.
910,00:43:23.07,00:43:23.07,We look cool.
911,00:43:24.67,00:43:24.67,You guys ready?
912,00:44:02.43,00:44:02.43,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
913,00:44:28.10,00:44:28.10,"Now bring in the members of our jury-- Dave, Deena,"
914,00:44:31.53,00:44:31.53,"Alex, Christy, Heidi and Butch,"
915,00:44:34.83,00:44:34.83,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
916,00:44:41.90,00:44:41.90,"Well, I'm glad to see that you embraced"
917,00:44:44.67,00:44:44.67,"the warrior preparation part of your afternoon because,"
918,00:44:48.33,00:44:48.33,"as I told you, you are about to embark"
919,00:44:50.67,00:44:50.67,on your final immunity challenge.
920,00:44:52.43,00:44:52.43,"It will take place here,"
921,00:44:53.83,00:44:53.83,and it will play out in front of the jury.
922,00:44:56.20,00:44:56.20,And it will be followed by a Tribal Council
923,00:44:59.63,00:44:59.63,where the person who holds immunity
924,00:45:01.90,00:45:01.90,will not only vote out the 14th member of the tribe
925,00:45:04.23,00:45:04.23,"and put them over on the jury, they will also decide"
926,00:45:06.83,00:45:06.83,who they are taking with them to the final vote--
927,00:45:10.00,00:45:10.00,probably the most critical decision in this game.
928,00:45:13.57,00:45:13.57,This is the purest of immunity challenges
929,00:45:16.83,00:45:16.83,because it is simply based on will.
930,00:45:19.33,00:45:19.33,How badly do you want it?
931,00:45:21.00,00:45:21.00,Here's how it's going to work.
932,00:45:22.83,00:45:22.83,You're going to be standing barefoot
933,00:45:24.90,00:45:24.90,on a narrow wooden perch.
934,00:45:26.30,00:45:26.30, It's going to be hard  to keep your balance.
935,00:45:28.77,00:45:28.77,You'll be holding your headdress above you.
936,00:45:31.10,00:45:31.10,I'll put a collar around your neck.
937,00:45:33.27,00:45:33.27,"On that collar will be a string of beads,"
938,00:45:35.23,00:45:35.23,which will attach to the back of your headdress
939,00:45:38.07,00:45:38.07,so that you can't move too far forward or too far to the side.
940,00:45:40.97,00:45:40.97,Your goal-- stay on that perch longer than anybody else.
941,00:45:45.37,00:45:45.37,"If you fall off the perch, you're out."
942,00:45:48.30,00:45:48.30,If your headdress touches
943,00:45:49.90,00:45:49.90,"any part of your head or your body, you're out."
944,00:45:53.27,00:45:53.27,The person to stay on their perch the longest
945,00:45:55.13,00:45:55.13,with their headdress above them wins immunity.
946,00:45:58.63,00:45:58.63,"Jenna, I need back the necklace."
947,00:46:07.53,00:46:07.53,"For the last time, this tattered immunity necklace"
948,00:46:10.17,00:46:10.17,is back up for grabs.
949,00:46:12.43,00:46:12.43,All right. Take off your shoes.
950,00:46:13.97,00:46:13.97,Take a spot behind your perch.
951,00:46:15.47,00:46:15.47,Put your headdress above your head.
952,00:46:17.43,00:46:17.43,Step up on your perch.
953,00:46:19.27,00:46:19.27,"Find a good, comfortable spot."
954,00:46:22.90,00:46:22.90,Relax.
955,00:46:24.67,00:46:24.67,Find your balance.
956,00:46:26.30,00:46:26.30,Everybody feeling good?
957,00:46:27.90,00:46:27.90,Mmm.
958,00:46:29.10,00:46:29.10,PROBST: Are you comfortable?
959,00:46:30.30,00:46:30.30,-No. -Are you balanced?
960,00:46:32.03,00:46:32.03,No.
961,00:46:33.30,00:46:33.30,Here we go. The challenge is now... starting.
962,00:47:09.03,00:47:09.03,"Oh. Matthew, you're out."
963,00:47:11.43,00:47:11.43,You two hold tight.
964,00:47:13.70,00:47:13.70,"Matthew, sit squat on the floor right in front of here."
965,00:47:29.03,00:47:29.03,"-Jenna, you want to make a deal? -(Jenna chuckles)"
966,00:47:31.87,00:47:31.87,"Jenna, step down, and I'll take you."
967,00:47:33.53,00:47:33.53,"No. No, let's just fight it out."
968,00:47:35.73,00:47:35.73,I think we should just fight it out
969,00:47:38.43,00:47:38.43,and pick whoever we wanted to pick.
970,00:47:47.63,00:47:47.63,"PROBST: Matt, are you surprised at all"
971,00:47:49.03,00:47:49.03,-that Rob's trying to make a deal? -Little bit.
972,00:47:51.53,00:47:51.53,"But you know what? If I was in his position,"
973,00:47:52.97,00:47:52.97,I might be doing the same thing. I don't know.
974,00:47:54.73,00:47:54.73,I didn't do well enough to find out.
975,00:47:58.83,00:47:58.83,PROBST: You guys are past the tough point.
976,00:48:01.17,00:48:01.17,-You've found your balance. -My... my ankles are so weak.
977,00:48:15.33,00:48:15.33,PROBST: Immunity has never been more important.
978,00:48:33.37,00:48:33.37,Whoa.
979,00:48:35.40,00:48:35.40,PROBST: You guys hang tight.
980,00:48:39.20,00:48:39.20,You're doing great.
981,00:48:40.87,00:48:40.87,Make an impressive showing to the jury.
982,00:49:00.53,00:49:00.53,Rob is out.
983,00:49:02.27,00:49:02.27,"Jenna, take a step down."
984,00:49:05.27,00:49:05.27,You have the most important immunity.
985,00:49:07.83,00:49:07.83,Take a seat. Congratulations.
986,00:49:09.83,00:49:09.83,"Congratulations, Jenna."
987,00:49:10.83,00:49:10.83,-Jenna. -Thanks.
988,00:49:12.47,00:49:12.47,Great job.
989,00:49:14.07,00:49:14.07,PROBST: Take a seat.
990,00:49:18.83,00:49:18.83,Jenna...
991,00:49:20.57,00:49:20.57,this is a ceremony.
992,00:49:26.60,00:49:26.60,"You have a lot of decorations on,"
993,00:49:28.07,00:49:28.07,but none more valuable than that immunity necklace.
994,00:49:35.63,00:49:35.63,"Well, I know how you're feeling, Jenna."
995,00:49:38.07,00:49:38.07,You're guaranteed a spot in the final two.
996,00:49:39.27,00:49:39.27,You're in the driver's seat.
997,00:49:41.20,00:49:41.20,"How you feeling, Rob? You hung in there as long as you could."
998,00:49:43.60,00:49:43.60,I did... I did the best I could.
999,00:49:45.70,00:49:45.70,"Uh, you know, I-I don't feel"
1000,00:49:47.53,00:49:47.53,"like I'm in a great position right now,"
1001,00:49:49.20,00:49:49.20,but what can I do at this point?
1002,00:49:50.93,00:49:50.93,-But a great job by Jenna. -PROBST: Matthew...
1003,00:49:52.73,00:49:52.73,"Matthew, you were the first out, and you were out quickly."
1004,00:49:55.13,00:49:55.13,"Are you worried that Jenna might say, ""You know what,"
1005,00:49:57.20,00:49:57.20,"you don't deserve it""?"
1006,00:49:58.57,00:49:58.57,"I did my best, you know."
1007,00:49:59.87,00:49:59.87,I was exhausted today.
1008,00:50:01.33,00:50:01.33,It affected my performance.
1009,00:50:03.27,00:50:03.27,"Um, Jenna did an exceptional job."
1010,00:50:06.90,00:50:06.90,She won. She deserves it.
1011,00:50:08.90,00:50:08.90,She'll make the right decision.
1012,00:50:10.47,00:50:10.47,-It's her decision to make. -So what do you base it on?
1013,00:50:13.57,00:50:13.57,We talk about this all the time at Tribal Council.
1014,00:50:15.07,00:50:15.07,What do you base votes on?
1015,00:50:16.67,00:50:16.67,"Um, I think it's someone I think deserves it,"
1016,00:50:20.03,00:50:20.03,someone I think's worked hard.
1017,00:50:21.47,00:50:21.47,"Um, also, like I said,"
1018,00:50:23.60,00:50:23.60,good competition at the end is important for me.
1019,00:50:27.07,00:50:27.07,So you don't want to nec...
1020,00:50:28.50,00:50:28.50,I don't want someone I can beat.
1021,00:50:29.87,00:50:29.87,So you're not going to pick the easy mark.
1022,00:50:31.90,00:50:31.90,"No, because that's... I-I feel like winning"
1023,00:50:34.33,00:50:34.33,"is beating your best competition,"
1024,00:50:36.30,00:50:36.30,and I really meant that when I said it.
1025,00:50:38.33,00:50:38.33,"PROBST: And you're willing to risk $900,000--"
1026,00:50:41.13,00:50:41.13,the difference between a million and second place-- on that?
1027,00:50:43.80,00:50:43.80,"But I feel like I've played the game well,"
1028,00:50:46.33,00:50:46.33,so I feel like good competitions never hurt.
1029,00:50:49.70,00:50:49.70,"So, Jenna, you have a big, big decision."
1030,00:50:51.50,00:50:51.50,-Are you ready to make it? -Yes.
1031,00:50:54.53,00:50:54.53,"Rob, you can't vote for Jenna."
1032,00:50:56.23,00:50:56.23,-You can only vote for Matthew. -Understood.
1033,00:50:57.87,00:50:57.87,"Matthew, you can't vote for Jenna."
1034,00:50:59.00,00:50:59.00,You can only vote for Rob.
1035,00:51:00.17,00:51:00.17,You two cancel each other out.
1036,00:51:01.53,00:51:01.53,"Therefore, the only person voting is Jenna."
1037,00:51:03.50,00:51:03.50,"Jenna, in casting this vote, you are simultaneously"
1038,00:51:07.17,00:51:07.17,voting out the 14th member and deciding
1039,00:51:10.27,00:51:10.27,who you're taking with you to the final two.
1040,00:51:12.40,00:51:12.40,It is time to vote. Jenna.
1041,00:51:21.83,00:51:21.83,"-Mateo. -Good luck, dude."
1042,00:51:22.83,00:51:22.83,-Good luck. -May the best man
1043,00:51:24.40,00:51:24.40,go to the final two.
1044,00:51:47.87,00:51:47.87,I'll go get the vote.
1045,00:52:00.50,00:52:00.50,"Once the vote is read, the decision is final."
1046,00:52:02.43,00:52:02.43,Person voted out will be asked to leave
1047,00:52:04.13,00:52:04.13,the Tribal Council area immediately.
1048,00:52:05.50,00:52:05.50,I will read the vote.
1049,00:52:13.17,00:52:13.17,"The 14th person voted out,"
1050,00:52:15.93,00:52:15.93,and the last member of our jury...
1051,00:52:20.47,00:52:20.47,Rob.
1052,00:52:21.47,00:52:21.47,It's okay. It's okay.
1053,00:52:22.47,00:52:22.47,PROBST: Need to bring me your torch.
1054,00:52:23.93,00:52:23.93,"Good luck, dude."
1055,00:52:33.83,00:52:33.83,"Rob, the tribe has spoken."
1056,00:52:37.87,00:52:37.87,It's time for you to go.
1057,00:52:47.33,00:52:47.33,"Well, Matt and Jenna, congratulations."
1058,00:52:50.83,00:52:50.83,You've worked hard to get here.
1059,00:52:52.27,00:52:52.27,You've gone as far as you can go in this game.
1060,00:52:55.10,00:52:55.10,The power now shifts to the jury.
1061,00:52:58.00,00:52:58.00,There'll be one final Tribal Council where you will get
1062,00:53:01.60,00:53:01.60,a chance to state your case
1063,00:53:03.27,00:53:03.27,as to why you deserve the title of sole Survivor
1064,00:53:06.83,00:53:06.83,and the reward of a million dollars.
1065,00:53:09.43,00:53:09.43,You have tonight and tomorrow to think about that.
1066,00:53:12.97,00:53:12.97,Head back to camp.
1067,00:53:14.40,00:53:14.40,Good night.
1068,00:53:24.27,00:53:24.27,"ROB:  Well, what can I say?"
1069,00:53:25.90,00:53:25.90,38 days out here in the Amazon.
1070,00:53:28.23,00:53:28.23,"I have, honestly, no complaints."
1071,00:53:30.20,00:53:30.20,I wouldn't change one thing about how I played the game.
1072,00:53:32.10,00:53:32.10, Most tremendous time  of my entire life.
1073,00:53:36.07,00:53:36.07,I said I wasn't going to stop smiling
1074,00:53:37.70,00:53:37.70,"until they put my torch out, and you know what?"
1075,00:53:39.77,00:53:39.77,I'm still smiling.
1076,00:53:59.43,00:53:59.43,JENNA: Where's the white paint?
1077,00:54:01.43,00:54:01.43,MATTHEW: You got to come right by my side.
1078,00:54:03.60,00:54:03.60,"-I am. -Add this, too."
1079,00:54:06.30,00:54:06.30,JENNA: Last time we will ever do this in the Amazon.
1080,00:54:08.83,00:54:08.83,And we're the only two people here to witness it.
1081,00:54:10.90,00:54:10.90,I'll put my fingerprint on the tree.
1082,00:54:12.80,00:54:12.80,-Yep. -Just in case anybody wants to arrest me.
1083,00:54:16.20,00:54:16.20,MATTHEW:  Now it's day 39. It's over.
1084,00:54:18.90,00:54:18.90, It's wrap-up time.
1085,00:54:20.00,00:54:20.00," Yeah, I can say I'm..."
1086,00:54:21.33,00:54:21.33,"I'm a bit sad, you know,"
1087,00:54:22.90,00:54:22.90,"to see it all kind of, uh, come to an end."
1088,00:54:25.73,00:54:25.73,"Just been an amazing, unforgettable experience."
1089,00:54:29.83,00:54:29.83,(thunder rumbling)
1090,00:54:41.30,00:54:41.30,JENNA: The weather's  been horrid-- terrible rain--
1091,00:54:44.17,00:54:44.17," so we decided  to take a look back,"
1092,00:54:46.57,00:54:46.57," and, um, we're going  to kind of write"
1093,00:54:48.20,00:54:48.20,everybody's name in white paint
1094,00:54:49.73,00:54:49.73, in the order  they got kicked off.
1095,00:54:51.27,00:54:51.27," It's just about the memories,  the people,"
1096,00:54:53.63,00:54:53.63,"all of that, because it's all important."
1097,00:54:58.87,00:54:58.87,MATTHEW: Ryan.
1098,00:55:00.10,00:55:00.10,JENNA: \xe2\x99\xaa Ryan. \xe2\x99\xaa
1099,00:55:01.90,00:55:01.90,-JENNA: First person voted off.  -MATTHEW: Voted off. Ryan...
1100,00:55:04.63,00:55:04.63," -I remember him as being a  pretty decent guy. -He, um..."
1101,00:55:06.87,00:55:06.87,"JENNA: Janet, I thought, like,  was my, like, mom in the game."
1102,00:55:10.50,00:55:10.50," -Yeah? -Like, she was so  motherly and so caring and..."
1103,00:55:12.63,00:55:12.63,MATTHEW:  Voted off-- Dan.
1104,00:55:14.37,00:55:14.37,JENNA: Dan! Another one  I didn't get to meet.
1105,00:55:16.40,00:55:16.40,"MATTHEW: He was a decent guy, and it was tough to see him go."
1106,00:55:19.70,00:55:19.70," -Joanna.  -You never met Joanna, either."
1107,00:55:22.00,00:55:22.00,MATTHEW: A lot of the guys  in our tribe really thought
1108,00:55:24.23,00:55:24.23, that she was probably  pretty tough to deal with.
1109,00:55:26.53,00:55:26.53," Now, the fifth person  voted out was Jeanne, correct?"
1110,00:55:29.47,00:55:29.47,"JENNA:  Mm-hmm. The merge, right?"
1111,00:55:30.87,00:55:30.87, But she definitely  was a hard worker nonstop.
1112,00:55:32.63,00:55:32.63,MATTHEW:  Right.
1113,00:55:34.00,00:55:34.00,"JENNA:  And, um... oh, Shawna."
1114,00:55:37.03,00:55:37.03,"MATTHEW: Shawna, Shawna.  I remember Shawna."
1115,00:55:39.37,00:55:39.37," So that's six.  Now, the seventh person"
1116,00:55:41.10,00:55:41.10,"voted out, I believe, is Roger."
1117,00:55:43.50,00:55:43.50, -Correct?  -Roger!
1118,00:55:44.63,00:55:44.63,MATTHEW:  Roger-- everyone's favorite.
1119,00:55:46.70,00:55:46.70, So the next person is Dave.
1120,00:55:48.87,00:55:48.87, -Boo-yah!  -Boo-yah!
1121,00:55:50.70,00:55:50.70, -Bangarang!  -Bangarang!
1122,00:55:52.17,00:55:52.17,JENNA:  I'll never forget that.
1123,00:55:53.67,00:55:53.67, Deena.
1124,00:55:55.63,00:55:55.63," I think that Deena  is a strong, strong woman,"
1125,00:55:58.50,00:55:58.50, and that's great character  to have.
1126,00:56:00.60,00:56:00.60,"MATTHEW: All right, that's nine.  Number ten is Alex."
1127,00:56:02.90,00:56:02.90,"JENNA: Yes, and I had a really  good time with him at the,"
1128,00:56:05.27,00:56:05.27," um, Amazon Cafe after he won  the reward..."
1129,00:56:06.87,00:56:06.87,-MATTHEW: So it's going to be  number 11-- Christy. -Yes.
1130,00:56:08.97,00:56:08.97,"MATTHEW: You know, I found her  to be probably the most"
1131,00:56:11.17,00:56:11.17, independent-minded person of  all of the members of Jacar\xc3\xa9.
1132,00:56:14.20,00:56:14.20,-JENNA: Next.  -MATTHEW: Next is Heidi.
1133,00:56:16.23,00:56:16.23, -Heidi!  -Your buddy.
1134,00:56:17.67,00:56:17.67,"JENNA:  Ooh, I miss her so much."
1135,00:56:19.70,00:56:19.70, I don't want to talk about  her-- it'll make me cry.
1136,00:56:22.00,00:56:22.00, -Butch.  -Butch.
1137,00:56:23.27,00:56:23.27,MATTHEW:  My buddy Butch.
1138,00:56:25.13,00:56:25.13,I-I really enjoyed his company.
1139,00:56:27.47,00:56:27.47, He was one of the far...  hardest-working...
1140,00:56:29.33,00:56:29.33,JENNA:  Rob Cesternino.
1141,00:56:30.63,00:56:30.63,"MATTHEW:  Robasu. I owe him so much,"
1142,00:56:33.07,00:56:33.07," because when I came  into the game, I..."
1143,00:56:35.37,00:56:35.37,JENNA:  And that sums up 14 people
1144,00:56:36.87,00:56:36.87, that have probably changed  the rest of our lives
1145,00:56:38.77,00:56:38.77, that we would have never  met in real life.
1146,00:56:40.70,00:56:40.70, It's just closure to a chapter
1147,00:56:42.27,00:56:42.27,"in our life that I don't think will ever be fully closed,"
1148,00:56:45.10,00:56:45.10,but we're just kind of putting the bookmark in it
1149,00:56:47.23,00:56:47.23, and closing it for right now.
1150,00:57:08.63,00:57:08.63,MATTHEW:  It feels great
1151,00:57:10.43,00:57:10.43, that the strategic part  of this game is over.
1152,00:57:13.00,00:57:13.00, It's been such an incredible  evolution for me.
1153,00:57:15.83,00:57:15.83,To go from being an underdog
1154,00:57:18.60,00:57:18.60," and to have everyone gunning for me at every corner,"
1155,00:57:22.67,00:57:22.67, and to eventually learn  how to build strategy
1156,00:57:26.00,00:57:26.00," and make it to the final two,"
1157,00:57:29.17,00:57:29.17,"it's almost absurd, but somehow I did it."
1158,00:57:34.23,00:57:34.23,"JENNA:  21, the youngest Survivor."
1159,00:57:37.27,00:57:37.27, I don't think  I've quite realized
1160,00:57:39.00,00:57:39.00, what it's like  to be in the final two.
1161,00:57:40.70,00:57:40.70,"I mean, I feel like I've worked  really hard to get here,"
1162,00:57:43.37,00:57:43.37," and it's an honor, and this is"
1163,00:57:44.83,00:57:44.83,"the biggest accomplishment in this game, and in my life,"
1164,00:57:47.07,00:57:47.07,and I don't think it's sunk in yet.
1165,00:57:52.37,00:57:52.37,MATTHEW: I'm absolutely ecstatic  to have made the final two.
1166,00:57:55.67,00:57:55.67," There was certainly  luck involved,"
1167,00:57:57.80,00:57:57.80, but there was a lot  of strategy.
1168,00:58:00.20,00:58:00.20,I actually threw that final immunity challenge.
1169,00:58:02.67,00:58:02.67, I did fall off of the perch  on purpose.
1170,00:58:07.27,00:58:07.27, I was convinced that  whoever won would select me.
1171,00:58:12.13,00:58:12.13,"It was a huge risk, and it does reflect a lot of..."
1172,00:58:14.80,00:58:14.80,"of what I've learned from Rob,"
1173,00:58:16.70,00:58:16.70, because he really is  a mastermind at this game.
1174,00:58:21.03,00:58:21.03,JENNA:  This is not a vacation.
1175,00:58:22.37,00:58:22.37, When you're pressed  to your limits
1176,00:58:23.90,00:58:23.90, and you have high highs  and low lows
1177,00:58:25.83,00:58:25.83,"and no in-betweens and no one to turn to,"
1178,00:58:28.20,00:58:28.20, it's just really a chance  to really learn about yourself
1179,00:58:31.13,00:58:31.13, and learn about how you feel  about your life
1180,00:58:33.17,00:58:33.17, and really learn
1181,00:58:34.43,00:58:34.43,about other people.
1182,00:58:38.13,00:58:38.13,MATTHEW:  I will come out of this
1183,00:58:39.77,00:58:39.77, with a different perspective  on life.
1184,00:58:42.30,00:58:42.30," I'm a very intense individual,  maybe too much so."
1185,00:58:47.27,00:58:47.27,"I should really go out and enjoy life,"
1186,00:58:51.23,00:58:51.23,"uh, more than I have."
1187,00:58:53.40,00:58:53.40," Spend more time watching TV,"
1188,00:58:56.30,00:58:56.30, versus how I've led  my life to date.
1189,00:58:58.13,00:58:58.13," For instance, I could spend"
1190,00:58:59.70,00:58:59.70,20 hours on a weekend studying Swedish.
1191,00:59:04.37,00:59:04.37,-Two different types of fish. -I'm starving.
1192,00:59:06.23,00:59:06.23,JENNA:  Don't underestimate people
1193,00:59:07.77,00:59:07.77, because they're a woman
1194,00:59:09.57,00:59:09.57, or because they're small  or skinny or something.
1195,00:59:12.43,00:59:12.43,Being here taught me that I can push beyond my limits
1196,00:59:15.00,00:59:15.00,"way beyond I ever could think,"
1197,00:59:16.57,00:59:16.57," and that is, like,  a valuable life lesson,"
1198,00:59:18.70,00:59:18.70, especially for me  being so young.
1199,00:59:19.93,00:59:19.93," Like, I feel like"
1200,00:59:21.07,00:59:21.07,I can do anything right now.
1201,00:59:22.77,00:59:22.77,"Anything that you throw at me, I can handle."
1202,00:59:41.80,00:59:41.80,"MATTHEW:  I was out fishing,"
1203,00:59:43.07,00:59:43.07," and it was the tail end  of my fishing trip,"
1204,00:59:44.77,00:59:44.77," just getting ready  to wrap things up,"
1205,00:59:46.23,00:59:46.23," and I noticed that, uh,  the boat that we've been using"
1206,00:59:48.50,00:59:48.50, for the last two weeks  was floating nearby.
1207,00:59:50.63,00:59:50.63,I guess that we forgot to tether it
1208,00:59:53.13,00:59:53.13,"once we, um, boarded the, um, seaplane yesterday."
1209,00:59:58.37,00:59:58.37,I don't think we're going to be  needing it much longer.
1210,01:00:00.63,01:00:00.63, It is the 39th day.
1211,01:00:02.27,01:00:02.27," So I'm going to tug it  back to camp,"
1212,01:00:04.63,01:00:04.63," and I've got some ideas  how we can, uh, use it."
1213,01:00:08.97,01:00:08.97, My plan is to stockpile  some wood inside
1214,01:00:12.93,01:00:12.93, and plant our treemail dude  on top
1215,01:00:15.43,01:00:15.43, along with some artifacts  from our campsite.
1216,01:00:22.57,01:00:22.57, And basically light it on fire  and send it off.
1217,01:00:26.90,01:00:26.90,I think it's a great way to get some closure
1218,01:00:28.97,01:00:28.97,on this whole experience.
1219,01:00:32.40,01:00:32.40,I want to have him face this way.
1220,01:00:34.27,01:00:34.27,Okay.
1221,01:00:36.00,01:00:36.00,That looks good.
1222,01:00:37.10,01:00:37.10,Yep.
1223,01:00:40.33,01:00:40.33,-Treemail dude. -Very nice.
1224,01:00:46.90,01:00:46.90,-Let's torch it. -Yeah.
1225,01:00:58.23,01:00:58.23,JENNA: I'm ready to see it burn.
1226,01:01:00.10,01:01:00.10,"All right, I'm going to step back."
1227,01:01:01.23,01:01:01.23,You ready to light this baby?
1228,01:01:08.80,01:01:08.80,JENNA: Whoo!
1229,01:01:11.00,01:01:11.00,That was great!
1230,01:01:12.63,01:01:12.63,"-Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm fine. (mutters)"
1231,01:01:14.97,01:01:14.97,-That's cool. -Push that bad boy out there.
1232,01:01:17.03,01:01:17.03,Whoo!
1233,01:01:19.03,01:01:19.03,(Jenna laughs)
1234,01:01:25.40,01:01:25.40,"JENNA: All right, let it go."
1235,01:01:30.13,01:01:30.13,Very cool.
1236,01:01:34.30,01:01:34.30,JENNA: It's over.  It's out of our hands.
1237,01:01:36.70,01:01:36.70, We have done all we can do.
1238,01:01:38.33,01:01:38.33,The jury will come back tonight  with questions.
1239,01:01:40.60,01:01:40.60," That's kind of, like,  our last chance to..."
1240,01:01:42.63,01:01:42.63,really cement what we feel about ourself and them
1241,01:01:45.83,01:01:45.83,one last time to the jury.
1242,01:01:47.47,01:01:47.47,I do feel like the m-majority of the jury
1243,01:01:49.33,01:01:49.33,probably already has their decision made
1244,01:01:50.87,01:01:50.87,by the time they come... came there.
1245,01:01:52.63,01:01:52.63," I would, you know,  um, but it's out of our hands."
1246,01:01:56.00,01:01:56.00, It's really out of our hands  right now.
1247,01:01:58.23,01:01:58.23,MATTHEW: The final two: Jenna and Mateo.
1248,01:02:01.20,01:02:01.20,-We did... -Who would've thought?
1249,01:02:03.53,01:02:03.53,All right. Let's go.
1250,01:02:04.93,01:02:04.93,Let's wrap it up.
1251,01:02:06.17,01:02:06.17,Let's head to our final TC.
1252,01:02:14.90,01:02:14.90,"ROB: This game began  as a battle of the sexes,"
1253,01:02:18.33,01:02:18.33," and in the end, it shall be  as it was in the beginning--"
1254,01:02:21.67,01:02:21.67, a man versus a woman.
1255,01:02:23.70,01:02:23.70,"I think both of them have played this game dishonest,"
1256,01:02:25.97,01:02:25.97,and both of them claim to be honest players
1257,01:02:28.17,01:02:28.17,who've played this game with integrity.
1258,01:02:30.07,01:02:30.07, Loyalty is out the window  at this point.
1259,01:02:32.10,01:02:32.10," It's who did the best job to outwit, outplay and outlast."
1260,01:02:36.03,01:02:36.03," Is it Jenna, or is it Matt?"
1261,01:02:38.07,01:02:38.07,"I wish there was a choice ""C""--"
1262,01:02:39.87,01:02:39.87,none of the above-- but there isn't.
1263,01:02:48.90,01:02:48.90,"CHRISTY: Jenna is a very  determined, very strong woman."
1264,01:02:53.20,01:02:53.20," I mean, she made it  all the way. Go, girl."
1265,01:02:55.60,01:02:55.60,Matt is a very sincere
1266,01:02:58.27,01:02:58.27,"and very generous, very caring person that..."
1267,01:03:02.50,01:03:02.50,everyone likes if you get to know him.
1268,01:03:12.43,01:03:12.43,ALEX: The response  that I'm really looking for
1269,01:03:14.77,01:03:14.77, is an honest response.
1270,01:03:16.33,01:03:16.33, We know what answers  we want to hear.
1271,01:03:18.03,01:03:18.03, We know what  the honest answer is.
1272,01:03:19.83,01:03:19.83, I just want to know  who's honest enough to say it.
1273,01:03:21.73,01:03:21.73,"I want the person to... up there to say,"
1274,01:03:24.23,01:03:24.23,"""I played the game, I came here to kick ass,"
1275,01:03:26.60,01:03:26.60,"""I kicked ass, and that's all there was to it."
1276,01:03:28.73,01:03:28.73," You don't like it,  you should've played better."""
1277,01:03:40.27,01:03:40.27,HEIDI: Tonight's choice  will be very easy for me.
1278,01:03:43.07,01:03:43.07,Jenna is... she's my number-one hero.
1279,01:03:46.20,01:03:46.20,"I just... I totally, completely adore her."
1280,01:03:48.80,01:03:48.80,"And, uh, then you've got Matt,"
1281,01:03:50.77,01:03:50.77,"who has played the game based on his ""honesty"" values,"
1282,01:03:54.23,01:03:54.23,"and, uh, sorry, Matt, it's just..."
1283,01:03:56.53,01:03:56.53,it's just not working for you.
1284,01:04:08.30,01:04:08.30,BUTCH:  Matt is the one
1285,01:04:10.17,01:04:10.17,that contributed the most.
1286,01:04:11.87,01:04:11.87,"Matt is the one that, um, has done more for everybody,"
1287,01:04:16.27,01:04:16.27, and Matt would be the one  more deserving than Jenna.
1288,01:04:26.40,01:04:26.40,DEENA:  You are dealing with two
1289,01:04:28.07,01:04:28.07,completely different personalities
1290,01:04:29.53,01:04:29.53,between Matt and Jenna.
1291,01:04:31.07,01:04:31.07,"Matt was the workhorse, Jenna was the sex goddess,"
1292,01:04:34.80,01:04:34.80,and the two of them used their abilities to their advantage.
1293,01:04:39.73,01:04:39.73,Matt worked his way to the top.
1294,01:04:42.27,01:04:42.27,Jenna... played her way to the top.
1295,01:04:54.17,01:04:54.17,DAVE: It is amazing at Tribal Council
1296,01:04:56.80,01:04:56.80,to kind of look at all the bull  that people throw out.
1297,01:04:59.50,01:04:59.50,It isn't friendship.
1298,01:05:01.47,01:05:01.47,It isn't honesty and integrity
1299,01:05:03.43,01:05:03.43,that's got them to this position.
1300,01:05:05.47,01:05:05.47,It's the fact that other people have kind of pulled them along.
1301,01:05:09.17,01:05:09.17, I think my vote  is going to be based
1302,01:05:11.27,01:05:11.27, upon their answer  to my question tonight.
1303,01:05:13.50,01:05:13.50, I want them to think  and give an intelligent answer
1304,01:05:16.40,01:05:16.40," and, uh... and then see if..."
1305,01:05:18.57,01:05:18.57,if they start... start talking out of their ass again.
1306,01:05:52.77,01:05:52.77,We'll now bring in our jury.
1307,01:05:58.50,01:05:58.50,"Dave, Deena, Alex,"
1308,01:06:00.83,01:06:00.83,"Christy, Heidi, Butch"
1309,01:06:04.20,01:06:04.20,"and Rob, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
1310,01:06:18.80,01:06:18.80,Welcome to your final Tribal Council.
1311,01:06:21.70,01:06:21.70,"First of all, let me say congratulations"
1312,01:06:23.80,01:06:23.80,on making it this far.
1313,01:06:26.83,01:06:26.83,"Tonight, the game shifts-- it enters the last phase."
1314,01:06:30.20,01:06:30.20,"For the past 39 days, the two of you"
1315,01:06:31.73,01:06:31.73,either directly or indirectly have had a hand in voting out
1316,01:06:35.07,01:06:35.07,the 14 other people who you started this game with.
1317,01:06:40.53,01:06:40.53,"Tonight, you won't vote."
1318,01:06:43.50,01:06:43.50,"Tonight, the power of the vote shifts to your jury."
1319,01:06:46.40,01:06:46.40,Seven people that you had a hand in voting out
1320,01:06:49.47,01:06:49.47,now hold your fate entirely in their hands.
1321,01:06:52.67,01:06:52.67,Tonight's Tribal Council
1322,01:06:54.40,01:06:54.40,is a chance for them to gather the information they need
1323,01:06:57.00,01:06:57.00,to help them make a big decision--
1324,01:06:58.47,01:06:58.47,which one of the two of you
1325,01:06:59.70,01:06:59.70,do they feel is the most deserving
1326,01:07:02.33,01:07:02.33,of the title of sole Survivor
1327,01:07:04.20,01:07:04.20,and the million dollars that goes with it.
1328,01:07:06.50,01:07:06.50,"Matthew and Jenna, in a moment,"
1329,01:07:08.63,01:07:08.63,you're going to have a chance to address the jury
1330,01:07:10.43,01:07:10.43,with your opening statements.
1331,01:07:12.50,01:07:12.50,Think about what you want to say.
1332,01:07:30.07,01:07:30.07,"PROBST: All right, we'll begin with the opening statements."
1333,01:07:31.40,01:07:31.40,Jenna.
1334,01:07:32.70,01:07:32.70,Um... I-I don't know.
1335,01:07:34.80,01:07:34.80,I really don't have much to say.
1336,01:07:36.50,01:07:36.50,"Um, I feel like you know enough about me"
1337,01:07:39.10,01:07:39.10,"in order to make an educated decision,"
1338,01:07:41.13,01:07:41.13,which I know that you will.
1339,01:07:42.50,01:07:42.50,"I feel like I've played this game morally,"
1340,01:07:44.90,01:07:44.90,and that means a lot to me.
1341,01:07:47.00,01:07:47.00,"And so I feel like you'll make the right decision,"
1342,01:07:49.83,01:07:49.83,so I'm just going to end it right there.
1343,01:07:52.43,01:07:52.43,Matthew.
1344,01:07:54.10,01:07:54.10,"Um, you know, I've done my best to provide for the tribe."
1345,01:07:57.20,01:07:57.20,I've been out fishing.
1346,01:07:58.67,01:07:58.67,"You know, I think that, um, I've shown"
1347,01:08:00.97,01:08:00.97,"that, um, I am dedicated to the tribe a-as a whole."
1348,01:08:05.30,01:08:05.30,"I feel that I have also shown that I am a serious competitor,"
1349,01:08:09.33,01:08:09.33,"that I play with heart,"
1350,01:08:11.60,01:08:11.60,"that I have a... a never-say-die attitude,"
1351,01:08:13.97,01:08:13.97,and I believe that I've been able
1352,01:08:15.57,01:08:15.57,to play the game honorably and maintain a level
1353,01:08:19.50,01:08:19.50,"of morality and integrity, uh, throughout."
1354,01:08:22.77,01:08:22.77,And I just wanted to share that with you.
1355,01:08:26.17,01:08:26.17,"PROBST: All right, jury."
1356,01:08:27.47,01:08:27.47,You've had a chance to hear their opening comments
1357,01:08:29.40,01:08:29.40,about why they feel they're most deserving.
1358,01:08:30.57,01:08:30.57,Now it's a chance for you
1359,01:08:32.57,01:08:32.57,to get a little more information.
1360,01:08:34.23,01:08:34.23,"You can make a comment,"
1361,01:08:35.30,01:08:35.30,"and if you want, you can ask a question."
1362,01:08:37.10,01:08:37.10,"Butch, you're first."
1363,01:08:42.83,01:08:42.83,"Matt and Jenna, congratulations."
1364,01:08:44.17,01:08:44.17,"-Thank you, Butch. -I want to address"
1365,01:08:45.80,01:08:45.80,this question to the both of you.
1366,01:08:47.70,01:08:47.70,(rustling)
1367,01:08:48.70,01:08:48.70,-Heads up. -Whoa! -Whoa. -Whoa.
1368,01:08:51.27,01:08:51.27,-Wow. -(Butch sighs)
1369,01:08:53.00,01:08:53.00,"Butch, maybe you better rethink that question."
1370,01:08:54.77,01:08:54.77,(laughter)
1371,01:08:56.07,01:08:56.07,-All right. -Dude.
1372,01:08:57.20,01:08:57.20,"PROBST: Hey, the Amazon is speaking."
1373,01:08:58.80,01:08:58.80,"Let's keep it going, guys."
1374,01:09:00.27,01:09:00.27,-Okay. (clears throat) -You were saying?
1375,01:09:02.43,01:09:02.43,My question is addressed to the both of you.
1376,01:09:04.87,01:09:04.87,"I've heard tonight the word ""integrity"" and ""honesty."""
1377,01:09:08.57,01:09:08.57,Are you telling me-- yes or no--
1378,01:09:11.70,01:09:11.70,"that you have not lied, that you were not deceitful"
1379,01:09:16.10,01:09:16.10,during our time together?
1380,01:09:18.43,01:09:18.43,I'd like to have a yes or no answer.
1381,01:09:20.67,01:09:20.67,Jenna.
1382,01:09:22.13,01:09:22.13,"Yes, I did lie to Deena when she asked me if..."
1383,01:09:24.87,01:09:24.87,"who I was voting for that night at Tribal Council,"
1384,01:09:26.43,01:09:26.43,"and I was voting for her, and I..."
1385,01:09:28.03,01:09:28.03,"did not tell her I was voting for her only because, um,"
1386,01:09:30.83,01:09:30.83,"I felt like she betrayed me and betrayed the alliance,"
1387,01:09:33.17,01:09:33.17,and I felt like it was the only necessary move to make.
1388,01:09:36.57,01:09:36.57,Thank you.
1389,01:09:37.83,01:09:37.83,Matthew.
1390,01:09:39.07,01:09:39.07,"Yes, I have lied. I lied to Roger."
1391,01:09:41.40,01:09:41.40,"He's not a member of the jury,"
1392,01:09:43.23,01:09:43.23,"but I lied to him as part of, um, an alliance strategy"
1393,01:09:47.10,01:09:47.10,at the time to eliminate him.
1394,01:09:50.03,01:09:50.03,And I deceived Alex in order to save my own skin.
1395,01:09:55.37,01:09:55.37,"-I appreciate your answers. -Thanks, Butch."
1396,01:09:57.67,01:09:57.67,Thank you.
1397,01:09:59.57,01:09:59.57,Rob.
1398,01:10:04.83,01:10:04.83,I would like to hear why you think
1399,01:10:08.77,01:10:08.77,the person next to you does not deserve
1400,01:10:11.20,01:10:11.20,to be here in the final two.
1401,01:10:13.23,01:10:13.23,Your answer to my question will determine my vote.
1402,01:10:16.50,01:10:16.50,Matthew.
1403,01:10:17.73,01:10:17.73,"I think that Jenna has, um,"
1404,01:10:22.00,01:10:22.00,not done as much as the rest of us to contribute at camp.
1405,01:10:27.00,01:10:27.00,"I haven't seen her collect water, boil water,"
1406,01:10:30.00,01:10:30.00,"um, gather wood, um,"
1407,01:10:32.90,01:10:32.90,help with the shelter.
1408,01:10:34.33,01:10:34.33,There were times when she
1409,01:10:37.17,01:10:37.17,"had expressed a desire to give up in the game,"
1410,01:10:39.23,01:10:39.23,"and I felt that, uh, that was, um,"
1411,01:10:42.87,01:10:42.87,really inappropriate and really affected
1412,01:10:44.40,01:10:44.40,my feelings towards her.
1413,01:10:45.87,01:10:45.87,PROBST: Jenna.
1414,01:10:47.23,01:10:47.23,"Um, I don't think Matthew"
1415,01:10:49.23,01:10:49.23,has played the game from the beginning.
1416,01:10:50.87,01:10:50.87,I think he took the opportunity
1417,01:10:52.67,01:10:52.67,to tag along at the end of an alliance.
1418,01:10:54.37,01:10:54.37,"Um, he doesn't need the money,"
1419,01:10:56.10,01:10:56.10,"he doesn't care about the people here,"
1420,01:10:58.37,01:10:58.37,"and, um, I just don't feel like this is a big deal for him."
1421,01:11:01.47,01:11:01.47,I feel like it's just another adventure
1422,01:11:02.80,01:11:02.80,on his list of things to do.
1423,01:11:05.00,01:11:05.00,"PROBST: Thanks, Rob."
1424,01:11:10.03,01:11:10.03,Alex.
1425,01:11:13.70,01:11:13.70,"Hey, you guys."
1426,01:11:14.70,01:11:14.70,"You know, we've sat around this... on the jury,"
1427,01:11:18.57,01:11:18.57,"listened to you guys at Tribal Council,"
1428,01:11:20.33,01:11:20.33,"and, um, the two words that I never,"
1429,01:11:22.80,01:11:22.80,"ever want to hear again are ""honesty"" and ""integrity."""
1430,01:11:26.03,01:11:26.03,Those words have no meaning to me anymore.
1431,01:11:28.50,01:11:28.50,I want to know from each of you
1432,01:11:31.13,01:11:31.13,what your biggest regret in this game is.
1433,01:11:33.57,01:11:33.57,If there was one thing that you could go back and change
1434,01:11:36.00,01:11:36.00,"about the way that you've played this game,"
1435,01:11:37.60,01:11:37.60,what is it and why?
1436,01:11:39.90,01:11:39.90,Jenna.
1437,01:11:41.27,01:11:41.27,I think my biggest regret looking back in this game
1438,01:11:43.30,01:11:43.30,is putting a little bit too much trust
1439,01:11:45.30,01:11:45.30,in people that I couldn't trust.
1440,01:11:47.43,01:11:47.43,"You know, why would somebody be honest to me all the time"
1441,01:11:49.50,01:11:49.50,when they have a chance to be dishonest
1442,01:11:50.53,01:11:50.53,and win a million dollars?
1443,01:11:51.53,01:11:51.53,"So I think that was, uh,"
1444,01:11:53.33,01:11:53.33,definitely one of my faults.
1445,01:11:56.07,01:11:56.07,Matthew.
1446,01:11:57.17,01:11:57.17,"My biggest regret, really,"
1447,01:12:00.47,01:12:00.47,is my na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9
1448,01:12:03.40,01:12:03.40,when I began the game
1449,01:12:05.93,01:12:05.93,and my decision initially
1450,01:12:09.07,01:12:09.07,to support Ryan
1451,01:12:13.17,01:12:13.17,"and his, um, alliance and voting strategy"
1452,01:12:17.17,01:12:17.17,that started this whole process
1453,01:12:19.10,01:12:19.10,of people regarding me as a threat.
1454,01:12:20.73,01:12:20.73,And it resulted in two weeks of...
1455,01:12:23.73,01:12:23.73,of-of near depression for me.
1456,01:12:26.63,01:12:26.63,Thanks.
1457,01:12:29.00,01:12:29.00,Heidi.
1458,01:12:33.47,01:12:33.47,"Hey, guys. Congratulations."
1459,01:12:35.70,01:12:35.70,"Um, I understand that the two of you"
1460,01:12:38.03,01:12:38.03,"are trying to outdo each other here, but since, uh,"
1461,01:12:41.23,01:12:41.23,"we're a part of the jury and we're deciding your fate,"
1462,01:12:43.53,01:12:43.53,I'd like to know if there is a particular person here
1463,01:12:45.63,01:12:45.63,that would be more deserving to be in your position.
1464,01:12:48.57,01:12:48.57,"And, uh, if you don't feel that way, that's fine."
1465,01:12:51.60,01:12:51.60,If you think you're more deserving
1466,01:12:52.80,01:12:52.80,"than any of us, that's fine,"
1467,01:12:54.63,01:12:54.63,but please explain why.
1468,01:12:56.07,01:12:56.07,-Matthew. -MATTHEW: Yeah.
1469,01:12:57.23,01:12:57.23,"I would say that, um..."
1470,01:13:00.13,01:13:00.13,"I think Rob deserves my seat,"
1471,01:13:03.00,01:13:03.00,because I think he's proven to be an amazing strategist.
1472,01:13:08.03,01:13:08.03,"I am in debt to him forever, because"
1473,01:13:11.00,01:13:11.00,"without Rob and without his... I-I would even call it tutelage,"
1474,01:13:15.27,01:13:15.27,there's no way that I would be here today.
1475,01:13:17.53,01:13:17.53,I would've been wiped out a long time ago.
1476,01:13:19.73,01:13:19.73,"If I had won immunity yesterday, Rob would be sitting next to me."
1477,01:13:24.30,01:13:24.30,I think that he deserves it more than Jenna.
1478,01:13:30.00,01:13:30.00,Jenna.
1479,01:13:31.13,01:13:31.13,"Um, unfortunately, I'm going to have"
1480,01:13:33.10,01:13:33.10,to echo Matt and say Rob.
1481,01:13:34.33,01:13:34.33,When it comes down to strategical game play
1482,01:13:36.33,01:13:36.33,"and just general wealth of knowledge of the game,"
1483,01:13:39.93,01:13:39.93,Rob has all that encompassed into one.
1484,01:13:42.37,01:13:42.37,So that's my answer.
1485,01:13:44.17,01:13:44.17,"I mean, just... I think that... is that the only person?"
1486,01:13:50.87,01:13:50.87,-I think they covered it. Yeah. -Okay.
1487,01:13:52.83,01:13:52.83,"-Okay. Is that it? Uh-huh. -Thanks, Heidi."
1488,01:13:55.03,01:13:55.03,Deena.
1489,01:13:58.57,01:13:58.57,"I've been sitting here listening,"
1490,01:14:01.30,01:14:01.30,"but as I listened to one of your responses, Jenna,"
1491,01:14:03.60,01:14:03.60,I was a little concerned.
1492,01:14:04.87,01:14:04.87,Because you said Matt shouldn't be there
1493,01:14:08.30,01:14:08.30,because he doesn't need the money.
1494,01:14:11.00,01:14:11.00,Do you honestly think
1495,01:14:12.57,01:14:12.57,that the way that we should judge our vote
1496,01:14:16.37,01:14:16.37,is based on need
1497,01:14:18.53,01:14:18.53,and not the way that the other person played the game?
1498,01:14:20.63,01:14:20.63,I-I think that need
1499,01:14:22.73,01:14:22.73,should come into it because that's just personally how I
1500,01:14:25.30,01:14:25.30,would go about voting if I was on the jury.
1501,01:14:26.80,01:14:26.80,"I know everybody's different,"
1502,01:14:28.13,01:14:28.13,but that's personally how I feel I would do it.
1503,01:14:31.60,01:14:31.60,"Okay. A-And, Matt, you very boldly and very clearly stated"
1504,01:14:35.67,01:14:35.67,"a couple of Tribal Councils ago, ""May the best man win,"""
1505,01:14:38.87,01:14:38.87,to which I was offended on Jenna's behalf.
1506,01:14:40.83,01:14:40.83,I don't know if she was offended.
1507,01:14:42.67,01:14:42.67,I thought that was a load of hooey.
1508,01:14:43.83,01:14:43.83,And... and it was based on your alliance
1509,01:14:46.70,01:14:46.70,with Butch and with Rob and with yourself.
1510,01:14:48.87,01:14:48.87,"Yeah, I don't remember saying,"
1511,01:14:50.90,01:14:50.90,"""May the best man win,"" but if I did,"
1512,01:14:52.90,01:14:52.90,I completely regret it
1513,01:14:54.80,01:14:54.80,because I'm not a... I'm not a chauvinist.
1514,01:14:57.57,01:14:57.57,"And I'm happy you pointed that out, because perhaps it did"
1515,01:15:01.13,01:15:01.13,reflect the fact that I thought we had it all locked up.
1516,01:15:03.97,01:15:03.97,All right. Thank you.
1517,01:15:05.23,01:15:05.23,"-Thanks, Deena. -Thanks."
1518,01:15:07.23,01:15:07.23,Christy.
1519,01:15:09.50,01:15:09.50,"(sighs) Hello, you guys."
1520,01:15:13.40,01:15:13.40,I think I'll go with Matt.
1521,01:15:14.93,01:15:14.93,What was your first initial reaction
1522,01:15:18.20,01:15:18.20,when you found out you were competing
1523,01:15:19.97,01:15:19.97,with a deaf woman like me?
1524,01:15:22.03,01:15:22.03,My initial reaction was
1525,01:15:24.50,01:15:24.50,that you were going to be really just like everyone else.
1526,01:15:28.63,01:15:28.63,"Um, I didn't treat you any differently."
1527,01:15:31.37,01:15:31.37,So your opinion inside never changed
1528,01:15:33.27,01:15:33.27,when you first found out that you were competing...
1529,01:15:35.17,01:15:35.17,"No, not at all. Not at all."
1530,01:15:36.50,01:15:36.50,I thought you had a funky accent.
1531,01:15:38.30,01:15:38.30,-That's all. -(laughing)
1532,01:15:39.60,01:15:39.60,"Okay. Jenna,"
1533,01:15:41.47,01:15:41.47,I found it very fascinating
1534,01:15:43.93,01:15:43.93,when you said that you had a handicap
1535,01:15:46.03,01:15:46.03,because you're beautiful.
1536,01:15:47.40,01:15:47.40,"And I am sitting there, like,"
1537,01:15:49.87,01:15:49.87,"""Hmm."" How... how is that a handicap?"
1538,01:15:52.77,01:15:52.77,"I-I've never, ever... outside in the real world,"
1539,01:15:55.40,01:15:55.40,I've never heard anybody say that they
1540,01:15:57.17,01:15:57.17,have a handicap because they're beautiful.
1541,01:15:58.50,01:15:58.50,So I would like you to explain that to me.
1542,01:16:00.93,01:16:00.93,-Okay. -I-I don't...
1543,01:16:02.67,01:16:02.67,"I don't know if I ever used the word ""handicap."""
1544,01:16:04.70,01:16:04.70,"-I can't find it... -I remember you used the word ""handicap."""
1545,01:16:07.00,01:16:07.00,"-Okay. I... -Um, do you guys remember hearing that? Okay."
1546,01:16:10.10,01:16:10.10,I-I was asked a question about how I felt
1547,01:16:12.80,01:16:12.80,like I was perceived when I came into this game.
1548,01:16:15.17,01:16:15.17,By no means did I mean to compare it in any way
1549,01:16:18.23,01:16:18.23,to what you are going through.
1550,01:16:20.67,01:16:20.67,"Okay, so you felt like basically from day one to now"
1551,01:16:23.90,01:16:23.90,that you have had a handicap because you're beautiful?
1552,01:16:26.80,01:16:26.80,JENNA: I didn't mean it like that.
1553,01:16:28.77,01:16:28.77,I thought because of me being 21 and attractive-looking
1554,01:16:32.67,01:16:32.67,and being a swimsuit model that people would
1555,01:16:34.57,01:16:34.57,automatically judge me as someone who was not tough
1556,01:16:37.63,01:16:37.63,and not smart and couldn't think for themself.
1557,01:16:39.90,01:16:39.90,"And that's what I meant by ""handicap."""
1558,01:16:42.73,01:16:42.73,-I'm sorry if you were offended. -Okay.
1559,01:16:47.03,01:16:47.03,"Dave, the last jury member."
1560,01:16:51.53,01:16:51.53,(clears throat) Evening.
1561,01:16:53.67,01:16:53.67,My question for both of you is:
1562,01:16:56.93,01:16:56.93,What modern influential leader
1563,01:16:59.80,01:16:59.80,have you emulated during this game?
1564,01:17:02.33,01:17:02.33,And what qualities do you feel
1565,01:17:05.80,01:17:05.80,from that individual that you have shown best?
1566,01:17:08.77,01:17:08.77,I'm trying to get somebody that... that I can relate to--
1567,01:17:12.50,01:17:12.50,"a-a name of-of somebody that I would say,"
1568,01:17:15.17,01:17:15.17,"""All right, Matt's done this like this person."""
1569,01:17:18.57,01:17:18.57,Matthew.
1570,01:17:19.57,01:17:19.57,"I would say, um, Colin Powell."
1571,01:17:22.83,01:17:22.83,"His whole concept of... of versatility,"
1572,01:17:25.83,01:17:25.83,"um, was a critical factor in my ability to..."
1573,01:17:29.77,01:17:29.77,to be here seated in this seat today.
1574,01:17:35.00,01:17:35.00,Jenna.
1575,01:17:36.53,01:17:36.53,"Um, I think that's a really g-great question,"
1576,01:17:39.07,01:17:39.07,"but honestly, I... I cannot think"
1577,01:17:41.27,01:17:41.27,of a modern leader that I emulated.
1578,01:17:43.00,01:17:43.00,"I choose to emulate people that I know really well, becau..."
1579,01:17:45.83,01:17:45.83,not just what I see on TV or read.
1580,01:17:47.70,01:17:47.70,"Um, that person that I do emulate, I think, is my mom."
1581,01:17:50.17,01:17:50.17,"I mean, I emulate my mom and dad both, and I gain from both,"
1582,01:17:53.17,01:17:53.17,"but mostly my mom, just because of her fight and strength,"
1583,01:17:56.27,01:17:56.27,and I think those are two really important qualities
1584,01:17:58.37,01:17:58.37,"not just to have here, but to have in real life."
1585,01:18:03.03,01:18:03.03,-Are you satisfied with that? -I'm satisfied.
1586,01:18:05.07,01:18:05.07,PROBST: Great. Thank you.
1587,01:18:08.33,01:18:08.33,"Okay, jury, you've had a chance to hear from the final two."
1588,01:18:09.97,01:18:09.97,You got a chance to ask your questions.
1589,01:18:12.17,01:18:12.17,"In a moment, you will vote."
1590,01:18:14.23,01:18:14.23,"Take a moment, think about it."
1591,01:18:41.20,01:18:41.20,"PROBST: All right. Matthew and Jenna,"
1592,01:18:43.07,01:18:43.07,you've had a chance to address.
1593,01:18:45.27,01:18:45.27,They've had a chance to question you.
1594,01:18:47.33,01:18:47.33,This is your last shot at convincing them
1595,01:18:49.03,01:18:49.03,"why you are the most deserving person,"
1596,01:18:51.67,01:18:51.67,"why you deserve the title of sole Survivor,"
1597,01:18:53.53,01:18:53.53,"and more importantly, why you deserve a million dollars."
1598,01:18:56.53,01:18:56.53,"Jenna began this last time, so, Matthew, you will begin."
1599,01:18:59.80,01:18:59.80,I realize that I have been deceptive
1600,01:19:03.63,01:19:03.63,"and that I have lied, and I realize that..."
1601,01:19:08.13,01:19:08.13,now that is part of the game.
1602,01:19:11.37,01:19:11.37,"Um, and I don't belong on a pedestal"
1603,01:19:15.90,01:19:15.90,because I think everyone has done
1604,01:19:19.27,01:19:19.27,a certain amount of lying
1605,01:19:20.50,01:19:20.50,and there's been a certain amount of betrayal.
1606,01:19:22.10,01:19:22.10,"And I have, um, come to the realization that..."
1607,01:19:26.90,01:19:26.90,I do not have the level of integrity
1608,01:19:29.20,01:19:29.20,"or the, um, high moral character that I preach."
1609,01:19:32.73,01:19:32.73,"And, in fact, don't deserve that... that title."
1610,01:19:37.00,01:19:37.00,And I'd just like to end by saying
1611,01:19:38.77,01:19:38.77,that I've done my best to... to play this game
1612,01:19:41.83,01:19:41.83,to the best of my ability
1613,01:19:43.27,01:19:43.27,and I've learned a lot along the way.
1614,01:19:45.97,01:19:45.97,That's all I have to say.
1615,01:19:47.40,01:19:47.40,-Thank you. -PROBST: Jenna.
1616,01:19:48.80,01:19:48.80,"Yeah. Um, first of all, I just want to thank you guys"
1617,01:19:51.57,01:19:51.57,for really p-poking and prodding with the questions.
1618,01:19:54.43,01:19:54.43,They really gave me a chance to look back at things
1619,01:19:56.70,01:19:56.70,that I've done in this game that maybe I just wanted
1620,01:19:58.93,01:19:58.93,to put out of my mind or that I forgot.
1621,01:20:00.97,01:20:00.97,"Yeah, maybe I'm not the strongest person"
1622,01:20:02.33,01:20:02.33,"to cut down all the trees, but I still feel"
1623,01:20:04.30,01:20:04.30,"like I've put in my, you know, work at camp,"
1624,01:20:08.37,01:20:08.37,and I do feel like I've worked hard at the challenges.
1625,01:20:11.20,01:20:11.20,"And I... you know, I... when I came through at the end"
1626,01:20:13.87,01:20:13.87,"where I needed to save my butt,"
1627,01:20:15.67,01:20:15.67,"my determination really came through for me,"
1628,01:20:17.47,01:20:17.47,and I... I was really proud of myself.
1629,01:20:19.33,01:20:19.33,So it's hard for me to say any more than that.
1630,01:20:22.33,01:20:22.33,"Okay, jury, the voting process is a little different tonight."
1631,01:20:25.00,01:20:25.00,"Tonight, you are not voting somebody out."
1632,01:20:27.47,01:20:27.47,"Tonight, you are voting for someone."
1633,01:20:29.57,01:20:29.57,You are voting for the person you think is most deserving
1634,01:20:33.27,01:20:33.27,of the title of sole Survivor
1635,01:20:34.83,01:20:34.83,"and, as importantly, the million dollars that goes with it."
1636,01:20:38.23,01:20:38.23,"So, Matthew and Jenna, you want your name"
1637,01:20:41.07,01:20:41.07,to be written down tonight.
1638,01:20:43.37,01:20:43.37,"For the last time in the Amazon, it is time to vote."
1639,01:20:46.77,01:20:46.77,"Butch, you're up."
1640,01:20:59.20,01:20:59.20,BUTCH:  Congratulations to both.
1641,01:21:01.67,01:21:01.67, I'm very proud  to have known both of you.
1642,01:21:04.00,01:21:04.00," But tonight, the true Survivor"
1643,01:21:05.77,01:21:05.77,is Matthew.
1644,01:21:07.27,01:21:07.27,"And, Matthew, I believe you said it all"
1645,01:21:09.33,01:21:09.33,in your opening statement.
1646,01:21:11.00,01:21:11.00, I also appreciate  your honesty--
1647,01:21:12.97,01:21:12.97," that you did lie,  that you did deceive."
1648,01:21:15.57,01:21:15.57, It meant a lot to me.
1649,01:21:17.17,01:21:17.17," Congratulations to both,  but, Matthew,"
1650,01:21:19.70,01:21:19.70,you are the true Survivor of Survivor VI.
1651,01:21:48.57,01:21:48.57,"Jenna, I'm voting for you tonight because"
1652,01:21:51.60,01:21:51.60, I adore you.
1653,01:21:53.77,01:21:53.77, I love you.
1654,01:21:55.27,01:21:55.27, You played the game hard.
1655,01:21:56.90,01:21:56.90," But more importantly,"
1656,01:21:58.50,01:21:58.50,you represented someone that I could trust and respect
1657,01:22:02.03,01:22:02.03,in the most adverse circumstances.
1658,01:22:05.07,01:22:05.07,"Good luck, girl."
1659,01:22:43.33,01:22:43.33,You did show here that you have the will
1660,01:22:45.90,01:22:45.90," and the determination it took  to get to the final two,"
1661,01:22:50.03,01:22:50.03, and I'll give credit  where credit is due--
1662,01:22:52.23,01:22:52.23,that there are only two players  in this entire game
1663,01:22:55.63,01:22:55.63, that I didn't vote off.
1664,01:23:04.47,01:23:04.47,"Matthew, Jenna, I'll go get the votes."
1665,01:23:26.57,01:23:26.57,"Guys, I would love to read these votes right now."
1666,01:23:30.50,01:23:30.50,You've been out here a long time.
1667,01:23:31.83,01:23:31.83,I know you want to know the answer.
1668,01:23:33.17,01:23:33.17,"Unfortunately, the reading of the votes"
1669,01:23:34.93,01:23:34.93,will have to wait until we get back to the United States.
1670,01:23:39.23,01:23:39.23,I'll see you there.
1671,01:24:09.43,01:24:09.43,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

1677,01:26:20.47,01:26:20.47,(crowd cheering and applauding)
1678,01:26:51.00,01:26:51.00,(cheering and applause continue)
1679,01:27:10.73,01:27:10.73,Let's get to it.
1680,01:27:12.27,01:27:12.27,'Cause these guys have been waiting.
1681,01:27:22.13,01:27:22.13,"Hello, Jenna."
1682,01:27:23.63,01:27:23.63,"Hello, Matthew."
1683,01:27:25.60,01:27:25.60,"Jury, everybody here, looking good."
1684,01:27:28.47,01:27:28.47,Surviving the weather that we're having here in New York City.
1685,01:27:31.43,01:27:31.43,Okay.
1686,01:27:33.00,01:27:33.00,It's been a great season.
1687,01:27:34.97,01:27:34.97,It is time to bring it to a close.
1688,01:27:38.07,01:27:38.07,I think Rob said it best:
1689,01:27:40.10,01:27:40.10,it started as a battle of the sexes;
1690,01:27:41.83,01:27:41.83,it is only fitting that it end the same way.
1691,01:27:44.77,01:27:44.77,It was a long 39 days for you guys.
1692,01:27:48.20,01:27:48.20,"You don't get to the final two without doing something right,"
1693,01:27:50.47,01:27:50.47,"but ultimately, only one of you will be the sole Survivor."
1694,01:27:54.23,01:27:54.23,"Before we get to the votes, I want to do something different."
1695,01:27:57.07,01:27:57.07,I want to check in and see
1696,01:28:00.17,01:28:00.17,how confident you're both feeling.
1697,01:28:03.97,01:28:03.97,"Matthew, you've had a long time to think about this."
1698,01:28:06.27,01:28:06.27,You saw how it played out.
1699,01:28:07.50,01:28:07.50,You know what you said and did out there.
1700,01:28:09.37,01:28:09.37,"Of the seven jury members that you spent 39 days with,"
1701,01:28:11.97,01:28:11.97,"one way or another,"
1702,01:28:13.37,01:28:13.37,how many of these guys do you think voted for you?
1703,01:28:16.63,01:28:16.63,How many votes do you have?
1704,01:28:18.27,01:28:18.27,"I feel I've got two votes for, five votes against."
1705,01:28:21.70,01:28:21.70,Not very optimistic.
1706,01:28:23.73,01:28:23.73,CROWD: Aw.
1707,01:28:26.00,01:28:26.00,PROBST: Who voted for you?
1708,01:28:28.53,01:28:28.53,"I'm pretty confident that, um,"
1709,01:28:30.40,01:28:30.40,Butch and Christy are on my side.
1710,01:28:32.83,01:28:32.83,Rob a wild card?
1711,01:28:34.83,01:28:34.83,Rob is a wild card.
1712,01:28:36.90,01:28:36.90,"Jenna, how about you?"
1713,01:28:38.23,01:28:38.23,"Looking across at these guys,"
1714,01:28:39.23,01:28:39.23,-who do you know you have? -Um...
1715,01:28:40.47,01:28:40.47,"I would hope that Alex and Heidi voted for me,"
1716,01:28:42.70,01:28:42.70,"and I think that, honestly, the rest probably went to Matt."
1717,01:28:46.03,01:28:46.03,Okay. Now we're being humble.
1718,01:28:47.90,01:28:47.90,-All right. -(laughter)
1719,01:28:52.93,01:28:52.93,Here's how it's going to work.
1720,01:28:54.87,01:28:54.87,I will read the votes.
1721,01:28:57.60,01:28:57.60,This is something where you want to see your name.
1722,01:29:00.13,01:29:00.13,It's a little different tonight.
1723,01:29:01.73,01:29:01.73,They voted for a winner.
1724,01:29:02.90,01:29:02.90,Here's what's at stake-- for the winner:
1725,01:29:04.73,01:29:04.73,"Saturn Ion, which Matthew already owns one,"
1726,01:29:07.63,01:29:07.63,"bragging rights, the title of sole Survivor,"
1727,01:29:10.67,01:29:10.67,"and a little thing, uh,"
1728,01:29:12.20,01:29:12.20,about the million dollars that comes with it.
1729,01:29:14.37,01:29:14.37,"Jury, you've already made the decision."
1730,01:29:16.03,01:29:16.03,Let's share it with everybody else.
1731,01:29:17.53,01:29:17.53,There are seven votes inside here.
1732,01:29:19.17,01:29:19.17,It only takes four votes to win.
1733,01:29:22.67,01:29:22.67,You guys get settled.
1734,01:29:24.43,01:29:24.43,-I'll now read the votes. -(crowd laughing)
1735,01:29:29.83,01:29:29.83,Here we go.
1736,01:29:34.30,01:29:34.30,First vote...
1737,01:29:39.07,01:29:39.07,...Matt.
