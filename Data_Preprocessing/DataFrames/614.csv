1,00:00:07.23,00:00:09.37,"JEFF PROBST: 36 days ago, deep within"
2,00:00:09.37,00:00:11.53," the world's largest rain forest,"
3,00:00:11.53,00:00:14.30, 16 Americans began the adventure of a lifetime.
4,00:00:14.30,00:00:17.33," They were abandoned on the Rio Negro,"
5,00:00:17.33,00:00:18.90, in the heart of the Amazon.
6,00:00:18.90,00:00:20.90,"As I call out your name,I want you to climb"
7,00:00:20.90,00:00:22.80,down the rope ladderand get in the yellow boat.
8,00:00:22.80,00:00:25.07, The castaways were shocked to learn
9,00:00:25.07,00:00:27.13, the tribes were divided by gender.
10,00:00:27.13,00:00:28.97,ROGER: It's going to be the men against the women.
11,00:00:28.97,00:00:30.90, But they don't have the strength.
12,00:00:30.90,00:00:31.87,It's pathetic.
13,00:00:31.87,00:00:33.50,PROBST: And Christy had a shock
14,00:00:33.50,00:00:35.57, of her own for the Jaburu women.
15,00:00:35.57,00:00:37.83,"It's not a big deal,but I think it's something"
16,00:00:37.83,00:00:40.30,that every tribe membershould know-- that I am deaf.
17,00:00:40.30,00:00:42.60,JENNA: I'm just wondering how she's going to be able
18,00:00:42.60,00:00:44.37, to work with the group when she can't
19,00:00:44.37,00:00:45.43,really hear well.
20,00:00:45.43,00:00:47.70,"PROBST: That night, Christy discovered"
21,00:00:47.70,00:00:49.20, she had trouble communicating with her tribe.
22,00:00:49.20,00:00:52.80,"CHRISTY: As soon as it gets dark, that's where"
23,00:00:52.80,00:00:55.87,"my whole communicationjust shuts down,"
24,00:00:55.87,00:00:59.23, because I can't see... can't read their lips.
25,00:00:59.23,00:01:01.57,(crying): I'm ata big disadvantage.
26,00:01:04.67,00:01:07.10,PROBST: The men of Tambaqui quickly built their shelter...
27,00:01:07.10,00:01:10.20,I think I missed my callingin life as a lumberjack.
28,00:01:10.20,00:01:12.23,(sighs) That's...that's looking good right there.
29,00:01:13.73,00:01:15.50,(thunder crashing)
30,00:01:15.50,00:01:18.00,PROBST: ...while the women were left out in the rain.
31,00:01:18.00,00:01:19.93,Forgot that we're inthe middle of the Amazon
32,00:01:19.93,00:01:22.03,and that torrential rainstormscome by daily.
33,00:01:22.03,00:01:24.87,I can't believehow badly this sucks.
34,00:01:24.87,00:01:27.33,PROBST: The men discovered the hazards of jungle life.
35,00:01:27.33,00:01:28.67,Ow!
36,00:01:28.67,00:01:30.43,Damn it.
37,00:01:30.43,00:01:32.63,Ow! God!
38,00:01:33.90,00:01:35.27,PROBST: And it appeared the women
39,00:01:35.27,00:01:37.17, might not be able to survive at all.
40,00:01:37.17,00:01:39.50,"I'm just...I'm at the lowest of my low,"
41,00:01:39.50,00:01:43.37,and no one is respecting thefact that I am falling apart.
42,00:01:43.37,00:01:45.30,I'm having trouble walking.
43,00:01:45.30,00:01:46.37,(sniffles)
44,00:01:46.37,00:01:47.37, I'm just spent.
45,00:01:47.37,00:01:50.00,I don't think I've ever beenthis physically exhausted.
46,00:01:50.00,00:01:51.77,"PROBST: Despite the women's problems at camp,"
47,00:01:51.77,00:01:53.93, they proved they could be fierce competitors
48,00:01:53.93,00:01:57.23, and won four out of the first five challenges.
49,00:01:57.23,00:01:59.40,Jaburu wins immunity!
50,00:01:59.40,00:02:02.17,"-Jaburu wins reward!-Yeah, baby!"
51,00:02:02.17,00:02:03.80,Jaburu wins reward.
52,00:02:03.80,00:02:06.30,"Immunity, Jaburu!"
53,00:02:06.30,00:02:09.37," But in the end, neither tribe could escape Tribal Council,"
54,00:02:09.37,00:02:11.73, where two men...
55,00:02:11.73,00:02:13.90, and two women...
56,00:02:13.90,00:02:16.30, were voted out of the Amazon.
57,00:02:16.30,00:02:21.07," On day 13, Dave and Jenna went on date night in the jungle."
58,00:02:21.07,00:02:24.23,"We were, like, ready to just,like, chat away."
59,00:02:24.23,00:02:25.73,"Heidi, who I've become"
60,00:02:25.73,00:02:27.80,"-really close to, which...-I expected that."
61,00:02:27.80,00:02:30.53,"PROBST: But the next day, the game took a turn"
62,00:02:30.53,00:02:32.60, when they were forced to pick new tribes.
63,00:02:32.60,00:02:34.53,DAVE: Think she regretted saying
64,00:02:34.53,00:02:36.27,a lot of the informationshe did.
65,00:02:36.27,00:02:38.80,I've only heard good thingsabout Heidi.
66,00:02:40.10,00:02:42.10,"PROBST: Alex, Rob and Matthew"
67,00:02:42.10,00:02:44.73," went to Jaburu, and Christy, Jeanne"
68,00:02:44.73,00:02:46.70," and Heidi went to Tambaqui,"
69,00:02:46.70,00:02:48.60, bringing tears for some...
70,00:02:48.60,00:02:51.10,"-I love you.-I love you, too."
71,00:02:51.10,00:02:52.70,"-Honey, we're home!-Oh, yeah!"
72,00:02:52.70,00:02:55.17,PROBST: ...and excitement for others.
73,00:02:55.17,00:02:59.03,"Boys come into the camp, andShawna is 180 degrees better."
74,00:02:59.03,00:03:00.97,Hi!
75,00:03:00.97,00:03:02.97,I'm just really gladto be in a group
76,00:03:02.97,00:03:05.57,where this lantern is useful.
77,00:03:05.57,00:03:07.97,-Jaburu wins immunity!-(cheering)
78,00:03:07.97,00:03:09.77,"PROBST: When Tambaqui lost immunity,"
79,00:03:09.77,00:03:12.43, Dave approached Heidi to avoid a three-three tie.
80,00:03:12.43,00:03:14.00,"Like, if you werein my position,"
81,00:03:14.00,00:03:15.43,what do you thinkyou would do?
82,00:03:15.43,00:03:17.13,I'd c... I'd come with us.
83,00:03:17.13,00:03:21.33,PROBST: So Heidi sided with the men to vote out Jeanne.
84,00:03:21.33,00:03:25.50," At Jaburu, Rob and Deena formed an unlikely alliance."
85,00:03:25.50,00:03:28.13,"ROB: Deena is as hungry as I am,"
86,00:03:28.13,00:03:30.67,and she's the kind of personthat nobody would suspect
87,00:03:30.67,00:03:32.77,I would have anythingin common with.
88,00:03:32.77,00:03:34.97,"PROBST: Jaburu went to the next Tribal Council,"
89,00:03:34.97,00:03:37.60, where the women sided with the men.
90,00:03:37.60,00:03:38.27,Shawna.
91,00:03:38.27,00:03:41.40, And Shawna was voted out.
92,00:03:41.40,00:03:44.13," On day 19, the two tribes merged,"
93,00:03:44.13,00:03:45.97, and Jacar√© was born.
94,00:03:45.97,00:03:49.03,"Hey, here's to the new tribe,and here's to new friends."
95,00:03:49.03,00:03:50.60,-Yay!-Cheers!
96,00:03:50.60,00:03:51.80,PROBST: The women appeared to be
97,00:03:51.80,00:03:54.07, outnumbered and at a disadvantage.
98,00:03:54.07,00:03:56.40,ROGER: Our original game plan was the six guys
99,00:03:56.40,00:03:59.60,"against the, uh...against the girls, and..."
100,00:03:59.60,00:04:01.87,"you know, it should be just,pick 'em off."
101,00:04:01.87,00:04:03.77,"PROBST: But a new alliance composed of Rob,"
102,00:04:03.77,00:04:06.47," Deena, Alex, Heidi and Jenna"
103,00:04:06.47,00:04:09.77," blindsided Roger, and then Dave,"
104,00:04:09.77,00:04:12.23, making him the first member of the jury.
105,00:04:12.23,00:04:14.43,"It is not the battleof the sexes anymore,"
106,00:04:14.43,00:04:17.30,but it's the battle of theweaker versus the stronger.
107,00:04:17.30,00:04:19.10,PROBST: Deena tried to get rid
108,00:04:19.10,00:04:21.37, -of her biggest threat. -DEENA: Alex must go.
109,00:04:21.37,00:04:22.77,"Period, end of statement."
110,00:04:22.77,00:04:24.03,"PROBST: But her plan backfired,"
111,00:04:24.03,00:04:26.23, and her own alliance turned on her.
112,00:04:26.23,00:04:28.90,Ninth person voted out andthe second member of our jury...
113,00:04:30.47,00:04:33.40," The foursome of Heidi, Rob, Alex and Jenna"
114,00:04:33.40,00:04:37.60," were in control, until Alex revealed his plan to Rob."
115,00:04:37.60,00:04:39.70,-The way I see it...-Mm-hmm.
116,00:04:39.70,00:04:43.63,"...if I win immunity,my vote goes for you."
117,00:04:44.93,00:04:47.77,PROBST: So Rob quickly formed a new alliance.
118,00:04:47.77,00:04:49.80,"Me, you, Butch and Christyvote out Alex tomorrow."
119,00:04:49.80,00:04:51.23,That's what I was thinking.
120,00:04:51.23,00:04:53.23,I don't trust Alex anymore.
121,00:04:53.23,00:04:56.23,He's lied and changed his storya number of times.
122,00:04:56.23,00:04:58.43,"PROBST: After a stunned Alex was voted out,"
123,00:04:58.43,00:05:02.10, Jenna and Heidiwere furious at Rob's betrayal.
124,00:05:02.10,00:05:03.57,This is the point--you don't care
125,00:05:03.57,00:05:05.37,about personal relationships;you just care about yourself.
126,00:05:05.37,00:05:07.43,I'm sorry I tried to keepmyself in a majority
127,00:05:07.43,00:05:09.23,in a gamewhere you vote people out.
128,00:05:09.23,00:05:10.73,But you're hurting peoplein the process.
129,00:05:10.73,00:05:13.00,PROBST: When Matthew won the reward challenge...
130,00:05:13.00,00:05:14.53,Matthew wins reward!
131,00:05:14.53,00:05:16.53, ...he sacrificed a visit from his mother...
132,00:05:16.53,00:05:18.47,Would you say it is betterto give
133,00:05:18.47,00:05:20.57,-or to receive?-It is better to give.
134,00:05:20.57,00:05:23.37, ...so the rest of the tribe could see their loved ones.
135,00:05:23.37,00:05:24.63,ROB: After Matthew gave everybody
136,00:05:24.63,00:05:26.90," their visit from home,"
137,00:05:26.90,00:05:28.73, I'm beginning to seriously doubt whether he's
138,00:05:28.73,00:05:31.13,"a beatable opponent anymore,and I may have"
139,00:05:31.13,00:05:33.47,to cut him offbefore the final two.
140,00:05:33.47,00:05:35.13,PROBST: Christy was unsure how she
141,00:05:35.13,00:05:37.37, was going to vote at Tribal Council.
142,00:05:37.37,00:05:39.80,You're still going to votefor Heidi tonight?
143,00:05:39.80,00:05:41.63,I guess so. I...
144,00:05:41.63,00:05:44.53,"-Guess so?-I-I... you know, I don't know."
145,00:05:44.53,00:05:47.30,The question is:who can I go farther with?
146,00:05:47.30,00:05:49.63,What can get me to bethe sole Survivor?
147,00:05:49.63,00:05:51.70,PROBST: And her ambivalence forced Rob
148,00:05:51.70,00:05:53.63, to change sides once again.
149,00:05:53.63,00:05:54.93,Would you just wantto make this
150,00:05:54.93,00:05:57.97,really easy on everybodyand vote out Christy tonight?
151,00:05:57.97,00:05:59.80,And you're willing to do that?
152,00:05:59.80,00:06:01.53,"PROBST: So, at Tribal Council,"
153,00:06:01.53,00:06:04.97, Christy was the 11th person voted out.
154,00:06:04.97,00:06:06.37,"-(howling)-PROBST: Last week,"
155,00:06:06.37,00:06:07.83, Matthew won the reward challenge
156,00:06:07.83,00:06:10.43, and invited Rob to a tailgate cookout.
157,00:06:10.43,00:06:12.90,"ROB: What do you want,a burger or hot dog first?"
158,00:06:12.90,00:06:14.03,MATTHEW:Hot dog.
159,00:06:14.03,00:06:15.80,I love hot dogs so much.
160,00:06:15.80,00:06:17.97,"Bon app√©tit, dude."
161,00:06:17.97,00:06:20.37,PROBST: And while the rest of the tribe headed home...
162,00:06:21.97,00:06:24.47, ...an unattended fire destroyed their camp.
163,00:06:30.27,00:06:33.53,"-HEIDI: Oh, my God.-JENNA: All my stuff."
164,00:06:33.53,00:06:36.33,All of our stuff--everything we have is gone.
165,00:06:36.33,00:06:38.93,PROBST: And Jenna learned her endurance has its limits.
166,00:06:38.93,00:06:42.30,(crying): I can't do thisanymore. I feel like crap.
167,00:06:42.30,00:06:44.70,I hate every minuteof being here.
168,00:06:46.53,00:06:48.60,PROBST: After Matthew won immunity...
169,00:06:48.60,00:06:50.37,Matthew wins immunity!
170,00:06:50.37,00:06:53.00," ...the men forced a sick Jenna to stay,"
171,00:06:53.00,00:06:55.83, and Heidi was the 12th person voted out of the Amazon
172,00:06:55.83,00:06:58.27, and the fifth member of the jury.
173,00:06:58.27,00:07:00.20,-Yep.-The tribe has spoken.
174,00:07:01.80,00:07:03.53, Only four remain:
175,00:07:03.53,00:07:06.00," Matthew, Jenna,"
176,00:07:06.00,00:07:08.33, Butch and Rob.
177,00:07:08.33,00:07:09.50," Tonight, they will compete"
178,00:07:09.50,00:07:12.10, in their final immunity challenges.
179,00:07:12.10,00:07:13.97, Two will advance to face the jury.
180,00:07:13.97,00:07:18.70,One will outlast all the othersand become the sole Survivor.
181,00:08:26.97,00:08:29.40,(thunder crashing)
182,00:08:40.77,00:08:45.00,-JENNA: I see embers.-MATTHEW: I-I got it.
183,00:08:45.00,00:08:46.30,Give me the dry stuff.
184,00:08:46.30,00:08:49.20,"ROB: Voting Heidi out was a tough decision,"
185,00:08:49.20,00:08:52.73, but these last couple days reminded me of a birthday card
186,00:08:52.73,00:08:55.83," that had a really hot girl on the front, and inside it says,"
187,00:08:55.83,00:08:57.80,"""No matter how hotyou think this girl is,"
188,00:08:57.80,00:08:59.20,"""somebody somewhereis sick and tired"
189,00:08:59.20,00:09:00.53,"of putting up with her crap."""
190,00:09:02.47,00:09:03.77,Can you give me some sticks?
191,00:09:03.77,00:09:05.00,-BUTCH: That... there they are.-Great.
192,00:09:05.00,00:09:06.63,BUTCH: Final four--
193,00:09:06.63,00:09:09.57,"just like in college basketball Final Four, it's big-time."
194,00:09:09.57,00:09:12.53," It's still miserable conditions-- cold, wet--"
195,00:09:12.53,00:09:16.97,"but deep inside,you're just jumping with joy."
196,00:09:18.37,00:09:19.97,-JENNA: There you go.-MATTHEW: More sticks.
197,00:09:19.97,00:09:21.77,BUTCH:I've got some more on the way.
198,00:09:21.77,00:09:22.93,Here it comes. Got 'em?
199,00:09:22.93,00:09:24.57,Yep.
200,00:09:24.57,00:09:26.10,JENNA: To be in the final four and be
201,00:09:26.10,00:09:28.00, the last woman here is really cool.

406,00:18:45.90,00:18:46.90,Anything can happen.
407,00:18:46.90,00:18:48.07,-Turn around.-That's true.
408,00:18:50.67,00:18:52.90,The very valuableimmunity necklace...
409,00:18:52.90,00:18:55.17,-You have no idea.-...is yours.
410,00:18:55.17,00:18:57.23,You are safefrom the vote tonight.
411,00:18:57.23,00:18:59.63,"The other three of you,fair game."
412,00:18:59.63,00:19:01.63,"Guys, head back,try and get dry."
413,00:19:01.63,00:19:03.83,I'll see you tonightat Tribal Council.
414,00:19:29.67,00:19:31.03,It's always a shock
415,00:19:31.03,00:19:33.80,when we get back to campand it's still in one piece.
416,00:19:33.80,00:19:35.83,-Yeah.-(Jenna chuckles)
417,00:19:35.83,00:19:37.77,"ROB: Butch, Matt and I"
418,00:19:37.77,00:19:40.30,"were going to be the final threeof this game,"
419,00:19:40.30,00:19:43.50," and when Jenna won immunity, it threw all that into chaos."
420,00:19:43.50,00:19:45.47,"JENNA: What did you havea problem with, Matt?"
421,00:19:45.47,00:19:47.80,"Um, I couldn't...my problem was..."
422,00:19:47.80,00:19:49.23,I was trying to find earth.
423,00:19:49.23,00:19:52.10,ROB: I've bitten all my fingernails off.
424,00:19:52.10,00:19:53.70, I'm pacing around.
425,00:19:53.70,00:19:56.93," I don't know what exactly I'm going to do yet,"
426,00:19:56.93,00:19:59.70,but it's a very scary timein the game for me.
427,00:19:59.70,00:20:03.40,"Yeah, I-I want to, uh,wash up a little bit."
428,00:20:03.40,00:20:05.97,You want us to washany of your stuff?
429,00:20:05.97,00:20:06.97,"No, it's... I'm fine."
430,00:20:06.97,00:20:08.63,"These socksare kind of gross, though."
431,00:20:08.63,00:20:10.30,JENNA: It was so great to win immunity.
432,00:20:10.30,00:20:13.03," I mean, I needed this to stay in the game-- case closed."
433,00:20:13.03,00:20:17.07,And now they got to changetheir plan.
434,00:20:17.07,00:20:18.87,-You want to go downand do that? -Sure.
435,00:20:18.87,00:20:20.23,"Let's do it, dude.Might as well, and then we"
436,00:20:20.23,00:20:21.30,can come back and do the manioc.
437,00:20:21.30,00:20:22.53,MATTHEW: I don't know
438,00:20:22.53,00:20:25.23, how Jenna feels about who should go.
439,00:20:25.23,00:20:27.17, I really don't know how things are going to unfold.
440,00:20:27.17,00:20:29.10,I anticipate that thereare going to be
441,00:20:29.10,00:20:31.10,a lot of negotiationsthis evening.
442,00:20:35.47,00:20:37.30,"What's up, Butch?"
443,00:20:37.30,00:20:38.70,"Um, you got plans yet?"
444,00:20:38.70,00:20:39.93,You know I got to ask you.
445,00:20:39.93,00:20:41.40,I-I don't know what to do.
446,00:20:41.40,00:20:42.70,What do... what...I don't know
447,00:20:42.70,00:20:44.33,"what you guys had...uh, were thinking."
448,00:20:44.33,00:20:45.60,What are you thinking?
449,00:20:45.60,00:20:49.33,"Well, I guess...uh, I guess I'm not..."
450,00:20:49.33,00:20:51.23,I guess the only thingI have to say
451,00:20:51.23,00:20:54.07,"is, yeah, I'd like to be inthe final three with you guys."
452,00:20:54.07,00:20:55.53,I... Okay.
453,00:20:55.53,00:20:56.67,"And I don't know,I'm just saying"
454,00:20:56.67,00:20:58.33,that this is whatI'd like to do...
455,00:20:58.33,00:21:00.27,"I'd say they'll probably gofor... you know, I don't know."
456,00:21:00.27,00:21:01.73,I have to get back and tell you.
457,00:21:01.73,00:21:03.33,"I'd say they're probably goingto talk up, say, ""Well,"
458,00:21:03.33,00:21:05.00,"who are we going to get?"" Andthey'll probably say, ""Butch."""
459,00:21:05.00,00:21:07.17,MATTHEW: You'll... you'll let meknow if she approaches you
460,00:21:07.17,00:21:08.83,"to say, ""Let's get ridof Matthew."""
461,00:21:08.83,00:21:10.83,"If she's going to vote for you,"
462,00:21:10.83,00:21:12.67,"then me and youjust vote for Butch,"
463,00:21:12.67,00:21:14.93,"and Butch is going to votefor me, and Butch goes."
464,00:21:14.93,00:21:16.83,"Yeah, exactly."
465,00:21:16.83,00:21:19.93,"ROB: Matt and I went through all the scenarios,"
466,00:21:19.93,00:21:23.27,"and basically, what I told Mattis that we need"
467,00:21:23.27,00:21:24.60," to vote for Butch, and he agreed."
468,00:21:24.60,00:21:26.20,"I got so many thingsin my head now,"
469,00:21:26.20,00:21:27.47,"-I can't...-I know. Well,"
470,00:21:27.47,00:21:29.17,the only decision that...that has to happen...
471,00:21:29.17,00:21:30.53,"okay, Jenna decidesshe's going to vote..."
472,00:21:30.53,00:21:31.83,"she's going to vote for Butch,"
473,00:21:31.83,00:21:34.20,"all right, we vote for Butch,and it's done."
474,00:21:34.20,00:21:35.80,-Right. -Butch is gone.We go to the final three.
475,00:21:37.80,00:21:39.67,Who would you like to see go?
476,00:21:39.67,00:21:41.97,"Well, who would you liketo see go? 'Cause I'm help..."
477,00:21:41.97,00:21:44.50,"you know, I'm asking youfor your help."
478,00:21:44.50,00:21:46.17,"Well, probably the personwho dogged me."
479,00:21:46.17,00:21:47.50,Probably Rob.
480,00:21:47.50,00:21:48.67,You've never done anythingto me.
481,00:21:48.67,00:21:50.17,-Right. -Matt's never doneanything to me.
482,00:21:50.17,00:21:52.83,"The only person who screwed meroyally was Rob, and that's"
483,00:21:52.83,00:21:54.50,"-the only thing I can go on.-Yeah. Well, if you would"
484,00:21:54.50,00:21:56.53,"stand by that, I would, uh...I would really appreciate it."
485,00:21:56.53,00:21:58.47,"No, no, that's what I...that's where we're at now."
486,00:21:58.47,00:22:01.90,"I appreciate the... you-youknow, here I am asking you..."
487,00:22:01.90,00:22:03.37,-And I... I said that's fine.-21... a 50-year-old guy asking
488,00:22:03.37,00:22:04.77,"-a 21-year-old girl. -Hey,the youngest and the oldest"
489,00:22:04.77,00:22:05.93,-sticking together.-Youngest... isn't that neat--
490,00:22:05.93,00:22:06.93,"the youngestand the oldest, huh?"
491,00:22:06.93,00:22:07.93,That's... that's really neat.
492,00:22:07.93,00:22:09.53,"Okay. Hey, I'm excited now."
493,00:22:09.53,00:22:11.27,I-I-I'm really excited.
494,00:22:11.27,00:22:13.37,"Yeah, don't be nervous.I'm for you."
495,00:22:13.37,00:22:14.37,All right.
496,00:22:17.97,00:22:20.00,"ROB: You know, don't...don't screw me over here, Matt."
497,00:22:20.00,00:22:22.73,"-No, I know. I'd like to...-Don't... It's-it's your call."
498,00:22:22.73,00:22:25.47,"Well, like I said,I'm telling you honestly"
499,00:22:25.47,00:22:27.17,and upfront as I havethroughout the game
500,00:22:27.17,00:22:29.60,that I'm going to do my bestto make a plan
501,00:22:29.60,00:22:31.33,-that has our best interestsin mind. -Mm-hmm.
502,00:22:31.33,00:22:33.47,MATTHEW: Rob is in real trouble.
503,00:22:33.47,00:22:36.60, He doesn't have a great relationship with Jenna.
504,00:22:36.60,00:22:39.10, He doesn't have any relationship with Butch.
505,00:22:39.10,00:22:42.77,His only real relationship inthis game is with yours truly.
506,00:22:42.77,00:22:44.20, So I'm the only guy
507,00:22:44.20,00:22:46.80," who can really, uh, keep him going in this game."
508,00:22:46.80,00:22:48.07,Trust me.
509,00:22:48.07,00:22:49.30,"And I'm... I'm going to, um..."
510,00:22:49.30,00:22:51.17,"I'm going to do my bestto speak to her today,"
511,00:22:51.17,00:22:53.53,-and I'm gonna work that deal.-And I appreciate that.
512,00:23:12.33,00:23:14.63,"MATTHEW:I know that Rob, you know,"
513,00:23:14.63,00:23:15.97,-is a bigger threat.-Screwed me.
514,00:23:15.97,00:23:17.77,"-You know, and he alsoscrewed you. -Right."
515,00:23:17.77,00:23:19.87,"Um, when I think about it,who really"
516,00:23:19.87,00:23:21.00,"-deserves it, you know,and... and I... -Right."
517,00:23:21.00,00:23:22.10,"you know, Butchhasn't screwed anyone..."
518,00:23:22.10,00:23:23.43,"JENNA:No, but he hasn't worked."
519,00:23:23.43,00:23:25.07,-...but Butch hasn'tdone anything. -I know.
520,00:23:25.07,00:23:27.70,-I just don't think he deservesto be there. -Right.
521,00:23:27.70,00:23:28.90,Rob has played the damn game.
522,00:23:28.90,00:23:30.33,"Yeah, he's-he's betrayeda lot of people,"
523,00:23:30.33,00:23:32.03,-and you know what?-Whatever.
524,00:23:32.03,00:23:33.73,-Both of us have a prettydecent shot. -Right.
525,00:23:33.73,00:23:35.13,-Because he's ...so many people over. -Right.
526,00:23:35.13,00:23:37.27,"-You know, and I'm coolabout it. -Mm-hmm."
527,00:23:37.27,00:23:39.03,And that's the one thingthat I have going for me now
528,00:23:39.03,00:23:40.40,-is I haven't screwed anyone.-Right. Right.
529,00:23:40.40,00:23:41.77,"You know, I haven't liedto anyone."
530,00:23:41.77,00:23:43.23,I haven't stabbed anyonein the back...
531,00:23:43.23,00:23:44.57,-stabbed anyone in the back.-No. That's true.
532,00:23:44.57,00:23:50.70,So how do you feelabout a secret alliance
533,00:23:50.70,00:23:56.80,based on a sharedvoting strategy this evening?
534,00:23:56.80,00:23:57.80,Okay.
535,00:23:57.80,00:24:00.13,"During tomorrow'simmunity challenge,"
536,00:24:00.13,00:24:01.77,-and if I won...-Mm-hmm.
537,00:24:01.77,00:24:03.83,"...or if you won, we wouldselect the other person."
538,00:24:03.83,00:24:06.10,"JENNA: Matt comes up to me and said that, you know,"
539,00:24:06.10,00:24:07.73," ""I promise you that I will take you"
540,00:24:07.73,00:24:09.37," to the final two if I win immunity."""
541,00:24:09.37,00:24:11.50," It's a strategical move on my part,"
542,00:24:11.50,00:24:14.33,"but people could still,you know, lie."
543,00:24:14.33,00:24:16.20,"I mean, Matt could take Rob,and that's fine,"
544,00:24:16.20,00:24:18.47,but he has to rememberthat I'm on the jury then
545,00:24:18.47,00:24:19.97,and he stabbed mein the back.
546,00:24:19.97,00:24:21.90,"-Okay, I swear on everything.-And-and we'll shake on it"
547,00:24:21.90,00:24:23.40,-right now before theycome back. -Yeah.
548,00:24:23.40,00:24:24.60,JENNA: Okay. I will votefor Butch tonight.
549,00:24:24.60,00:24:27.07,Okay. And I'm sure Robwill do the same.
550,00:24:27.07,00:24:30.33,"MATTHEW: If I win tomorrow's immunity challenge,"
551,00:24:30.33,00:24:32.43, I will take her to the final two.
552,00:24:32.43,00:24:34.40," Now, I will either"
553,00:24:34.40,00:24:39.40,"honor that secret alliance,or..."
554,00:24:39.40,00:24:41.40,do some backstabbing.
555,00:24:47.80,00:24:49.87,"JENNA: Butch doesn't want to vote for Matt,"
556,00:24:49.87,00:24:51.37," Rob doesn't want to vote for Matt,"
557,00:24:51.37,00:24:53.87,"so I have an opportunity to...to kick off someone like Butch,"
558,00:24:53.87,00:24:57.57," who I don't feel has done any work to get here, or Rob."
559,00:24:57.57,00:25:00.17,"You know, I could get him backfor what he did to me."
560,00:25:49.23,00:25:51.17,Now bring inthe members of our jury--
561,00:25:51.17,00:25:54.43,"Dave, Deena, Alex,"
562,00:25:54.43,00:25:57.80,Christy and Heidi.
563,00:26:06.97,00:26:09.23,37 days.
564,00:26:09.23,00:26:11.93,"Butch, you just ducked your headwhen I said that."
565,00:26:11.93,00:26:13.50,Just exhaust you hearing it?
566,00:26:13.50,00:26:16.27,It's-it's a... it's a wonderfulfeeling-- 37 days.
567,00:26:16.27,00:26:19.00,"Um, for me, personally, um,"
568,00:26:19.00,00:26:21.67,"I feel I've accomplishedmore than what, uh,"
569,00:26:21.67,00:26:23.90,I've ever dreamedabout accomplishing.
570,00:26:23.90,00:26:24.97,"Um, it's beena wonderful experience."
571,00:26:24.97,00:26:26.53,PROBST: How do you thinkyou got here?
572,00:26:26.53,00:26:28.90,How did you outlast12 other people?
573,00:26:28.90,00:26:31.60,I didn't make a lotof loud and noisy comments
574,00:26:31.60,00:26:32.93,and didn't cut anybody down.
575,00:26:32.93,00:26:34.43,I was very positivewith everybody.
576,00:26:34.43,00:26:36.07,I looked for the goodin a person
577,00:26:36.07,00:26:39.50,"and tried to, um, utilize that."
578,00:26:39.50,00:26:41.13,"Matthew, how'd you end up here?"
579,00:26:41.13,00:26:43.70,"Well, I hada very multifaceted strategy,"
580,00:26:43.70,00:26:46.80,"uh, based on honestyand versatility."
581,00:26:46.80,00:26:50.40,"Tried to be smart,um, tried to be intelligent,"
582,00:26:50.40,00:26:51.93,"and again, above all,"
583,00:26:51.93,00:26:54.13,tried to maintain my honestyand my integrity
584,00:26:54.13,00:26:56.20,so that people would trust me.
585,00:26:56.20,00:26:59.03,"Rob, how did you end upin this final four?"
586,00:26:59.03,00:27:01.53,I've been asking myselfthat question all day.
587,00:27:01.53,00:27:03.87,"I've been very fortunate,I think."
588,00:27:03.87,00:27:05.23,"Most of the time, when I..."
589,00:27:05.23,00:27:06.87,"when I've zigged,I should have zigged."
590,00:27:06.87,00:27:09.13,"Most of the time, when I zagged,I should have zagged."
591,00:27:09.13,00:27:12.80,"And I've been very, very luckythat I have taken"
592,00:27:12.80,00:27:14.17,a lot of risks in this game
593,00:27:14.17,00:27:16.43,and they've mostly paid offto this point.
594,00:27:16.43,00:27:18.00,"PROBST:Jenna, there have been times"
595,00:27:18.00,00:27:21.13,"where I thought you were goingto throw your hands up and say,"
596,00:27:21.13,00:27:23.97,"""You know what? Had enough.Get me out of here,"""
597,00:27:23.97,00:27:25.83,"try and engineer a quit,and yet,"
598,00:27:25.83,00:27:27.33,"not only are youin the final four,"
599,00:27:27.33,00:27:28.83,you're sitting with immunityaround your neck.
600,00:27:28.83,00:27:30.27,"Yeah, I mean, uh,"
601,00:27:30.27,00:27:32.47,"I've had really high highsand really low lows,"
602,00:27:32.47,00:27:34.73,"and there were timeswhere I wanted to quit,"
603,00:27:34.73,00:27:36.27,"but then I said, ""God,"
604,00:27:36.27,00:27:38.53,"I'm just going to kick myselfif I do that."""
605,00:27:38.53,00:27:41.40,"I've never needed immunitymore than I needed it today,"
606,00:27:41.40,00:27:43.57,so I just...I fought hard for it.
607,00:27:43.57,00:27:46.07,"Rob, how importantwas that immunity today,"
608,00:27:46.07,00:27:47.83,and how badly did you want it?
609,00:27:47.83,00:27:50.03,"Well, we're downto four people,"
610,00:27:50.03,00:27:52.33,"and one person'sgoing to go home,"
611,00:27:52.33,00:27:55.50,and the person that wearsthe immunity necklace
612,00:27:55.50,00:27:57.87,"can't be that person,so it's pretty damn important"
613,00:27:57.87,00:27:59.27,at this...at this stage in the game.
614,00:27:59.27,00:28:02.27,"Jenna, so as you sit therewith immunity around your neck"
615,00:28:02.27,00:28:03.80,"and you go back to camp,"
616,00:28:03.80,00:28:06.37,had to be a pretty interestingafternoon.
617,00:28:06.37,00:28:08.57,Did all of these guys approachyou at one time or another
618,00:28:08.57,00:28:10.03,"and say,""Jenna, let me talk to you?"""
619,00:28:10.03,00:28:12.67,"I-I've talked to all of them,because obviously there..."
620,00:28:12.67,00:28:13.77,it was a big game switch.
621,00:28:13.77,00:28:15.90,"Obviously, I was probablythe next to go."
622,00:28:15.90,00:28:18.63,"So I-I've spokento all of them, yeah."
623,00:28:18.63,00:28:21.20,Tell me about that feelingto be in the catbird seat.
624,00:28:21.20,00:28:23.50,It's different right nowfor me to feel like...
625,00:28:23.50,00:28:26.10,"like I'm... you know,have a little bit of control"
626,00:28:26.10,00:28:29.00,considering the last threeor whatever days
627,00:28:29.00,00:28:31.83,"I have had none, so...basically,"
628,00:28:31.83,00:28:33.80,"and it's a good feeling--it's good to feel like,"
629,00:28:33.80,00:28:36.00,"you know, you can makean important decision,"
630,00:28:36.00,00:28:38.00,and it's a big dealto have immunity
631,00:28:38.00,00:28:39.27,at this point in timein the game.
632,00:28:39.27,00:28:41.27,"Butch, as you sit hereabout to vote,"
633,00:28:41.27,00:28:42.57,what's it going to be based on?
634,00:28:42.57,00:28:43.90,Strategy.
635,00:28:43.90,00:28:45.47,Trying to stay in the game.
636,00:28:45.47,00:28:46.80,PROBST:Did you hustle today
637,00:28:46.80,00:28:48.33,to try and make sureyou could stay in?
638,00:28:48.33,00:28:50.63,"Um, I want to assure you,I hustled today,"
639,00:28:50.63,00:28:53.93,"and, um, I tried... I'm tryingto stay in the game, yes."
640,00:28:53.93,00:28:55.27,"PROBST:Rob, what kind of maneuvering"
641,00:28:55.27,00:28:56.60,did you try to do today
642,00:28:56.60,00:28:58.50,"to, uh, geton Jenna's good side?"
643,00:28:58.50,00:29:02.93,"Uh, I tried to make Jennalunch this afternoon."
644,00:29:02.93,00:29:05.83,I told her that shelooked beautiful today.
645,00:29:05.83,00:29:08.93,"But, seriously, I don't think"
646,00:29:08.93,00:29:11.77,that anything you can doafter somebody wins immunity
647,00:29:11.77,00:29:13.17,is going to change their mind.
648,00:29:13.17,00:29:15.97,I think it has to dowith what you did
649,00:29:15.97,00:29:18.23,before they hadthat power in the game.
650,00:29:18.23,00:29:20.53,"And, uh, we'll seewhat happens here tonight."
651,00:29:20.53,00:29:22.97,"On that note,it is time to vote."
652,00:29:22.97,00:29:24.10,"Rob, you're up."
653,00:29:37.00,00:29:39.43,I don't think all the firewood
654,00:29:39.43,00:29:42.60," in the forest is going to keep your torch lit tonight, buddy."
655,00:29:42.60,00:29:44.23,Nice game.
656,00:29:56.47,00:29:58.20,"Rob, I want to wish youthe very best."
657,00:29:58.20,00:29:59.40,You're a real good kid.
658,00:30:22.43,00:30:24.23,I'll go tally the votes.
659,00:30:34.70,00:30:37.10,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
660,00:30:37.10,00:30:38.67,Person voted outwill be asked to leave
661,00:30:38.67,00:30:40.30,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
662,00:30:40.30,00:30:41.50,I'll read the votes.
663,00:30:42.90,00:30:44.23,First vote.

670,00:31:15.87,00:31:17.17,Butch.
671,00:31:17.17,00:31:19.73,"That's it, Butch.You need to bring me your torch."
672,00:31:21.67,00:31:23.03,-Good luck.-Good luck.
673,00:31:23.03,00:31:25.23,"Guys, bl-bless you."
674,00:31:25.23,00:31:26.97,"I mean it, all right?"
675,00:31:31.73,00:31:33.87,"Butch, the tribe has spoken."
676,00:31:39.60,00:31:41.40,-It's time for you to go.-Good luck.
677,00:31:41.40,00:31:43.67,"-Bye, Butch.-Bye, Butch."
678,00:32:01.47,00:32:03.17,"PROBST:Well, today's immunity challenge"
679,00:32:03.17,00:32:05.27,and tonight's Tribal Councilclearly showed
680,00:32:05.27,00:32:07.27,the value of immunityand how quickly
681,00:32:07.27,00:32:10.43,it can change the course of thegame for the person who has it.
682,00:32:10.43,00:32:13.13,"You have one immunity challengeleft, and it's the biggest."
683,00:32:13.13,00:32:15.07,Guarantees you a spotin the final two
684,00:32:15.07,00:32:16.70,and the right to decide
685,00:32:16.70,00:32:20.03,who goes to the finalTribal Council with you.
686,00:32:20.03,00:32:22.20,Big day tomorrow.Head back to camp.
687,00:32:22.20,00:32:24.13,Good night.
688,00:32:27.43,00:32:31.13,I just experiencedan adventure of a lifetime.
689,00:32:31.13,00:32:33.10, I will never forget these 37 days.
690,00:32:33.10,00:32:35.73, I feel I played the game hard and I played it well.
691,00:32:35.73,00:32:37.17, The sign that I took--
692,00:32:37.17,00:32:38.47," I mean it when I say,"
693,00:32:38.47,00:32:39.77,"""Believe in yourself."""
694,00:32:39.77,00:32:42.93,You can do things if you go outand set your goals
695,00:32:42.93,00:32:45.40,and have your dreamsand then go out and do them.
696,00:32:45.40,00:32:47.53,Look at me.I made it through Survivor.
697,00:33:11.87,00:33:15.00,"Man, is there anything we...we can do about moths?"
698,00:33:15.00,00:33:17.70,"They're, like, killer moths.They're, like, biting."
699,00:33:20.80,00:33:24.03,ROB: After we thought the worst was over
700,00:33:24.03,00:33:27.47,"between the rainand getting finally dry,"
701,00:33:27.47,00:33:32.37," we were attacked by moths, and they just wanted to crash"
702,00:33:32.37,00:33:34.93, right into us like kamikaze moths.
703,00:33:34.93,00:33:37.13, I don't know where they all came from.
704,00:33:37.13,00:33:40.27,"I hadn't seen one mothin 37 days, but last night,"
705,00:33:40.27,00:33:41.53, moths were just everywhere.
706,00:33:41.53,00:33:43.87,There do seem to bea lot of them.
707,00:33:43.87,00:33:46.23,"-They're crazy. -JENNA: Yeah,they're, like, dive-bombing."
708,00:34:05.30,00:34:06.83,"ROB:Um, by my estimates,"
709,00:34:06.83,00:34:09.83,I would imagine that each of uswill get about...
710,00:34:09.83,00:34:13.30,between 16 to 17 manioc patties.
711,00:34:13.30,00:34:15.30,JENNA: Yes! This is the best dayof my life!
712,00:34:15.30,00:34:17.60,Babassu nuts out the ass.
713,00:34:17.60,00:34:19.33,-ROB: Yep.-And manioc.
714,00:34:19.33,00:34:20.80,"When we woke up this morning,"
715,00:34:20.80,00:34:23.17,we decided to havethe biggest breakfast
716,00:34:23.17,00:34:26.23, of our 38 days out in the jungle.
717,00:34:26.23,00:34:28.17,"MATTHEW: You guys, this is goingto be the most babassu"
718,00:34:28.17,00:34:29.33,we've had to date.
719,00:34:29.33,00:34:30.77,This is going to bethe most manioc
720,00:34:30.77,00:34:31.83,-we've had to date.-This is going to be great.
721,00:34:31.83,00:34:33.97,MATTHEW:Big meal for a big day.
722,00:34:33.97,00:34:36.43,"-JENNA: Very good, Rob.-Mm-hmm."
723,00:34:41.63,00:34:44.40,JENNA: Maybe the treemailwill be a candy bar.
724,00:34:44.40,00:34:45.73,ROB:You say that every time.
725,00:34:45.73,00:34:47.43,-I know.-What's that?
726,00:34:47.43,00:34:49.37,-He can read it. -It's somethingthat should be...
727,00:34:49.37,00:34:52.03,Mr. Treemail Man's gotone last thing to tell us.
728,00:34:52.03,00:34:54.13,Let's each put our armon this.
729,00:34:56.57,00:34:58.23,-Guys ready?-The final time.
730,00:34:58.23,00:35:00.83,"MATTHEW:One, two, three."
731,00:35:00.83,00:35:03.23,All right.Let's switch lines.
732,00:35:04.47,00:35:06.03,"MATTHEW:""It's not a challenge."
733,00:35:06.03,00:35:07.30,"ROB:""Just fun to do."
734,00:35:07.30,00:35:08.50,"JENNA:""So step on up."
735,00:35:08.50,00:35:10.30,"MATTHEW:See what's left of you."""
736,00:35:10.30,00:35:11.40,It's a scale.
737,00:35:13.53,00:35:14.97,Whoa.
738,00:35:14.97,00:35:16.60,-(Jenna laughing)-MATTHEW: So...
739,00:35:16.60,00:35:17.90,"Hey, let's go take itback to camp."
740,00:35:17.90,00:35:19.23,JENNA:Let's take it back to camp.
741,00:35:19.23,00:35:20.37,"I thought they meant,""See what's"
742,00:35:20.37,00:35:21.63,"left of you,"" and I looked left."
743,00:35:21.63,00:35:23.87,"ROB: What, so you were lookingoff to the left?"
744,00:35:23.87,00:35:25.07,"Yeah, I thoughtthey meant, like,"
745,00:35:25.07,00:35:26.27,there'd be somethingwaiting for us.
746,00:35:26.27,00:35:27.73,-You're crazy.-(Jenna laughs)
747,00:35:27.73,00:35:29.23,"When it says... when...when somebody tells you,"
748,00:35:29.23,00:35:31.00,"""That's right,""do you turn to your right?"
749,00:35:31.00,00:35:33.23,"JENNA:No, but I don't know."
750,00:35:33.23,00:35:36.30," ROB: We just got a gift from the treemail gods,"
751,00:35:36.30,00:35:39.00,and we got a scaleso we could weigh ourselves.
752,00:35:39.00,00:35:41.93,And we've all been dying to knowjust how much we weigh.
753,00:35:41.93,00:35:43.90,MATTHEW:Does it say 63?
754,00:35:43.90,00:35:46.13,JENNA:Looks like 64.
755,00:35:46.13,00:35:49.47,64. So I went from 80 to 64.
756,00:35:49.47,00:35:52.07,-JENNA: Wow.-Which is 16 kilos.
757,00:35:53.47,00:35:54.73,JENNA:So... and that all means what?
758,00:35:54.73,00:35:56.87,"-Uh, you got to do the math.-2.2 kilos to one pound."
759,00:35:56.87,00:35:58.43,This is too much work.
760,00:35:58.43,00:36:02.77,"MATTHEW: The scale was in kilos, and one kilo is 2.2 pounds,"
761,00:36:02.77,00:36:06.47, so I weighed myself in kilos and converted back to pounds.
762,00:36:06.47,00:36:07.87, I realized that my weight
763,00:36:07.87,00:36:11.87,"has gone from 173 to 148,"
764,00:36:11.87,00:36:14.60," and if I've lost 28 pounds, I think that I have lost"
765,00:36:14.60,00:36:17.30," most of the fat on my body and that,"
766,00:36:17.30,00:36:19.40," um, I'm right now losing muscle."
767,00:36:19.40,00:36:21.10,-Well...-You-you go fir... You go next.
768,00:36:22.83,00:36:24.17,JENNA:You're at 60.
769,00:36:24.17,00:36:26.57,"ROB:Yeah, I weigh 60 kilos, so..."
770,00:36:26.57,00:36:29.57,"according to this,I weigh about 130 pounds,"
771,00:36:29.57,00:36:31.90,but I don't thinkthat that's correct.
772,00:36:31.90,00:36:33.90,"-(Jenna laughs)-ROB: Basically,"
773,00:36:33.90,00:36:36.50,"over the last 38 days,my body has just"
774,00:36:36.50,00:36:39.20,deteriorated and...and turned against itself.
775,00:36:39.20,00:36:43.13," I mean, I've lost almost a pound a day for 38 days."
776,00:36:43.13,00:36:46.20,"60 kilos.Let me, uh, get a pen."
777,00:36:46.20,00:36:47.73,MATTHEW:What did you start out at?
778,00:36:47.73,00:36:49.93,"I came into this gameat about 170 pounds,"
779,00:36:49.93,00:36:52.90,"and I think I weigh around,like, 138 pounds right now,"
780,00:36:52.90,00:36:54.53,which is ridiculous.
781,00:36:57.30,00:37:00.43,"Okay, I weigh 46 kilos."
782,00:37:00.43,00:37:04.83,MATTHEW: 46 kilostimes 2.2 pounds per kilo.
783,00:37:04.83,00:37:07.30,"JENNA: I started at 118 pounds,"
784,00:37:07.30,00:37:10.53,"and I weigh 99, so that is a lotof weight to lose."
785,00:37:10.53,00:37:12.03,"Yeah, I think...don't think this is right."
786,00:37:12.03,00:37:14.00,"JENNA: Well, how do youthink...? What about mine?"
787,00:37:14.00,00:37:15.43,So what's the differencein kilos?
788,00:37:15.43,00:37:17.77,"JENNA:I-I weigh 45 kilos,"
789,00:37:17.77,00:37:20.47,and I started at 118 pounds.
790,00:37:20.47,00:37:22.47,"That's not goodto lose that much weight,"
791,00:37:22.47,00:37:25.83,"but then again, it'll bereally fun to gain it all back."
792,00:37:30.80,00:37:33.13,That amounts to about...
793,00:37:33.13,00:37:34.37,"What's up, guys?"
794,00:37:34.37,00:37:35.77,What's going on?
795,00:37:35.77,00:37:37.70,"-Come on... come on in.-JENNA: Jeff came into camp,"
796,00:37:37.70,00:37:39.87," and he's like, ""What's up, guys?"""
797,00:37:39.87,00:37:41.47," I was like, ""Whoa. What is going on?"""
798,00:37:41.47,00:37:43.00," I thought I was in, like, a dreamland."
799,00:37:43.00,00:37:46.03,Okay. 38 days.
800,00:37:46.03,00:37:47.50,You're telling us.
801,00:37:47.50,00:37:49.17,"PROBST: You've been survivingin the Amazon,"
802,00:37:49.17,00:37:50.80,"living off this land,"
803,00:37:50.80,00:37:53.23,"utilizing its resourceswhen you were able to,"
804,00:37:53.23,00:37:54.87,definitely fighting the elements
805,00:37:54.87,00:37:56.77,-when you had to.-Yeah. -Mm-hmm.
806,00:37:56.77,00:37:58.57,"So I thought it might be fun,"
807,00:37:58.57,00:37:59.97,"since this time is almost over,"
808,00:37:59.97,00:38:02.03,to take one last lookat the Amazon
809,00:38:02.03,00:38:04.70,from a slightly different view--from up above.
810,00:38:04.70,00:38:06.10,"-JENNA: Oh...-Oh, sweet."
811,00:38:06.10,00:38:08.77,PROBST: So we have a seaplaneride scheduled for you.

813,00:38:12.17,00:38:14.67,and I suggest-- if you can--to put the game on hold
814,00:38:14.67,00:38:16.87,for a few minutesand take it in.
815,00:38:16.87,00:38:18.23,Really take it in.
816,00:38:18.23,00:38:19.77,You're never comingback here again.
817,00:38:19.77,00:38:22.33,"When the ride is over,the pilot will drop you off"
818,00:38:22.33,00:38:25.63,"at a new canoe, smallerthan the boat you already have."
819,00:38:25.63,00:38:27.80,"You'll take this map.I'll give it to you, Jenna."
820,00:38:27.80,00:38:28.80,Thank you.

826,00:38:38.67,00:38:41.73,and adorn your bodyjust like Amazon warriors did
827,00:38:41.73,00:38:43.00,when they prepared for battle
828,00:38:43.00,00:38:45.20,"because, in a sense,that is what you are doing."
829,00:38:45.20,00:38:48.80,You are preparing for your finalimmunity challenge.
830,00:38:48.80,00:38:51.30,"When you're done,you will get in your new boat"
831,00:38:51.30,00:38:52.90,and you will headto Tribal Council.
832,00:38:52.90,00:38:54.17,"-Sounds awesome.-Right on, guys."

835,00:38:57.00,00:38:58.00,Thanks a lot.
836,00:38:58.00,00:39:00.13,MATTHEW: This opportunity to take a ride in a seaplane
837,00:39:00.13,00:39:01.77, and go above the canopy and see a lot
838,00:39:01.77,00:39:04.30,of the surroundings that reallyare inaccessible to us
839,00:39:04.30,00:39:06.40,"was just, uh... just amazing."
840,00:39:06.40,00:39:10.60, And we all were so excited and so happy.
841,00:39:10.60,00:39:12.17, It really felt like a reward
842,00:39:12.17,00:39:14.87, for all the time that we'd spent here.
843,00:39:14.87,00:39:19.40," We paddled up to the seaplane, climbed in, and..."
844,00:39:19.40,00:39:20.87,we were off. We were gone.
845,00:39:50.50,00:39:52.40,‚ô™ ‚ô™
846,00:40:20.53,00:40:24.20, JENNA: It's hard to... to... to really grasp
847,00:40:24.20,00:40:26.27, how large the Amazon is and how beautiful it is.
848,00:40:26.27,00:40:27.83, It's unbelievable.
849,00:40:27.83,00:40:29.87,"It's really something everybody should try to experience,"
850,00:40:29.87,00:40:31.83," you know, once in their life."
851,00:40:31.83,00:40:36.53,"MATTHEW: We saw rolling green carpets of jungle,"
852,00:40:36.53,00:40:38.87,and it was such an exhilarating feeling to...
853,00:40:38.87,00:40:40.33, to... to get away from camp
854,00:40:40.33,00:40:43.90, and to... to take in the surroundings from...
855,00:40:43.90,00:40:47.37,"from a seaplane from high above the, uh, jungle floor."
856,00:40:47.37,00:40:50.43," Uh, difficult to describe in words."
857,00:40:50.43,00:40:52.07,ROB: For us to have that opportunity
858,00:40:52.07,00:40:56.17,"was really a, uh... a nice time and a chance to enjoy the..."
859,00:40:56.17,00:40:57.90," you know, the amazing scenery"
860,00:40:57.90,00:40:59.73, that we've been a part of down here.
861,00:40:59.73,00:41:04.33," But under the surface,the game is still being played,"
862,00:41:04.33,00:41:06.40," and there certainly is strategy going on,"
863,00:41:06.40,00:41:08.03, and this game is pretty far from over.
864,00:41:19.33,00:41:21.40,"MATTHEW: After our plane flight,"
865,00:41:21.40,00:41:25.60, we boarded a small canoe and navigated through a...
866,00:41:25.60,00:41:29.53, a weed-choked river to a small hut.
867,00:41:32.37,00:41:33.60,Wow.
868,00:41:33.60,00:41:35.67,What are these? I wonder how these are worn.
869,00:41:35.67,00:41:38.40,This is so cool.I want this around my neck.
870,00:41:38.40,00:41:40.70,"And what's this, like,some sort of crotch protector?"
871,00:41:40.70,00:41:42.70,ROB: I-I don't think it'sa cup-- I'm pretty sure.
872,00:41:42.70,00:41:45.33,"JENNA: I think that's a littlesmall to be a cup there, cowboy."
873,00:41:45.33,00:41:46.93,Yeah. Cowboy.
874,00:41:46.93,00:41:49.00,"JENNA: We had all this jewelry and beads in there,"
875,00:41:49.00,00:41:50.43," really cool stuff, and... and flowers"
876,00:41:50.43,00:41:51.87, that we just put everywhere
877,00:41:51.87,00:41:54.10, and really decorated ourselves really cool and...
878,00:41:54.10,00:41:57.17,"started to just, like, go crazyand paint each other's faces."
879,00:42:18.10,00:42:19.37,"Yeah, okay."
880,00:42:19.37,00:42:20.70,That looks cool.
881,00:42:20.70,00:42:22.70,"ROB: Right now, I don't know"
882,00:42:22.70,00:42:24.73, what the immunity challenge is going to be.
883,00:42:24.73,00:42:27.23, All I know is it's the most important
884,00:42:27.23,00:42:28.77," immunity challenge of this game,"
885,00:42:28.77,00:42:30.07, so I'm preparing for everything:
886,00:42:30.07,00:42:31.57," mental, physical, anything."
887,00:42:31.57,00:42:34.93, This one could cost me a million dollars
888,00:42:34.93,00:42:36.90, if I'm not successful here today.
889,00:42:36.90,00:42:38.27,Let me see.
890,00:42:38.27,00:42:42.37,MATTHEW: If Jenna or Rob won the immunity challenge
891,00:42:42.37,00:42:44.27," and picked me, I wouldn't have to vote"
892,00:42:44.27,00:42:46.07, against the... the third person.
893,00:42:46.07,00:42:50.47, That third person would most likely favor me
894,00:42:50.47,00:42:52.23, over the person who voted them out.
895,00:42:52.23,00:42:56.23, It could be a wise strategicmove for me to lose on purpose.
896,00:42:58.30,00:42:59.97,Watch the makeup.
897,00:42:59.97,00:43:02.07,JENNA: It's time for the serious players to be in the game.
898,00:43:02.07,00:43:04.03, I really have worked hard to get here.
899,00:43:04.03,00:43:05.30,"Happy, happy, happy."
900,00:43:05.30,00:43:07.13,Don't...j-just don't let it go...
901,00:43:07.13,00:43:08.80, I don't know who I could beat in the final two.
902,00:43:08.80,00:43:10.03, I don't know what the jury's thinking.
903,00:43:10.03,00:43:11.30,-How's that?-Good.
904,00:43:11.30,00:43:14.17,"Rob burned me, he burned Heidi, he burned Alex,"
905,00:43:14.17,00:43:15.60," he burned our whole alliance,"
906,00:43:15.60,00:43:17.93," and he-he may be the one easier to beat,"
907,00:43:17.93,00:43:21.03," but it's out of my hands after the immunity challenge,"
908,00:43:21.03,00:43:23.07, so I'm not going to stress over it.
909,00:43:23.07,00:43:24.67,We look cool.
910,00:43:24.67,00:43:26.57,You guys ready?
911,00:44:02.43,00:44:04.33,‚ô™ ‚ô™
912,00:44:28.10,00:44:31.53,"Now bring in the membersof our jury-- Dave, Deena,"
913,00:44:31.53,00:44:34.83,"Alex, Christy, Heidi and Butch,"
914,00:44:34.83,00:44:37.43,voted out at the lastTribal Council.
915,00:44:41.90,00:44:44.67,"Well, I'm glad to seethat you embraced"
916,00:44:44.67,00:44:48.33,"the warrior preparation partof your afternoon because,"
917,00:44:48.33,00:44:50.67,"as I told you,you are about to embark"
918,00:44:50.67,00:44:52.43,on your finalimmunity challenge.
919,00:44:52.43,00:44:53.83,"It will take place here,"
920,00:44:53.83,00:44:56.20,and it will play outin front of the jury.
921,00:44:56.20,00:44:59.63,And it will be followedby a Tribal Council
922,00:44:59.63,00:45:01.90,where the personwho holds immunity
923,00:45:01.90,00:45:04.23,will not only vote outthe 14th member of the tribe
924,00:45:04.23,00:45:06.83,"and put them over on the jury,they will also decide"
925,00:45:06.83,00:45:10.00,who they are taking with themto the final vote--
926,00:45:10.00,00:45:13.57,probably the most criticaldecision in this game.
927,00:45:13.57,00:45:16.83,This is the purestof immunity challenges
928,00:45:16.83,00:45:19.33,because it is simplybased on will.
929,00:45:19.33,00:45:21.00,How badly do you want it?
930,00:45:21.00,00:45:22.83,Here's how it's going to work.
931,00:45:22.83,00:45:24.90,You're going to bestanding barefoot
932,00:45:24.90,00:45:26.30,on a narrow wooden perch.
933,00:45:26.30,00:45:28.77, It's going to be hard to keep your balance.
934,00:45:28.77,00:45:31.10,You'll be holding your headdressabove you.
935,00:45:31.10,00:45:33.27,I'll put a collararound your neck.
936,00:45:33.27,00:45:35.23,"On that collarwill be a string of beads,"
937,00:45:35.23,00:45:38.07,which will attachto the back of your headdress
938,00:45:38.07,00:45:40.97,so that you can't move too farforward or too far to the side.
939,00:45:40.97,00:45:45.37,Your goal-- stay on that perchlonger than anybody else.
940,00:45:45.37,00:45:48.30,"If you fall off the perch,you're out."
941,00:45:48.30,00:45:49.90,If your headdress touches
942,00:45:49.90,00:45:53.27,"any part of your heador your body, you're out."
943,00:45:53.27,00:45:55.13,The person to stayon their perch the longest
944,00:45:55.13,00:45:58.63,with their headdress above themwins immunity.
945,00:45:58.63,00:46:01.37,"Jenna, I need back the necklace."
946,00:46:07.53,00:46:10.17,"For the last time,this tattered immunity necklace"
947,00:46:10.17,00:46:12.43,is back up for grabs.
948,00:46:12.43,00:46:13.97,All right.Take off your shoes.
949,00:46:13.97,00:46:15.47,Take a spot behind your perch.
950,00:46:15.47,00:46:17.43,Put your headdressabove your head.
951,00:46:17.43,00:46:19.27,Step up on your perch.
952,00:46:19.27,00:46:22.90,"Find a good, comfortable spot."
953,00:46:22.90,00:46:24.67,Relax.
954,00:46:24.67,00:46:26.30,Find your balance.
955,00:46:26.30,00:46:27.90,Everybody feeling good?
956,00:46:27.90,00:46:29.10,Mmm.
957,00:46:29.10,00:46:30.30,PROBST:Are you comfortable?
958,00:46:30.30,00:46:32.03,-No.-Are you balanced?

960,00:46:33.30,00:46:36.53,Here we go. The challengeis now... starting.
961,00:47:09.03,00:47:11.43,"Oh. Matthew, you're out."
962,00:47:11.43,00:47:13.70,You two hold tight.
963,00:47:13.70,00:47:17.30,"Matthew, sit squat on the floorright in front of here."
964,00:47:29.03,00:47:31.87,"-Jenna, you want to make a deal?-(Jenna chuckles)"
965,00:47:31.87,00:47:33.53,"Jenna, step down,and I'll take you."
966,00:47:33.53,00:47:35.73,"No. No, let's justfight it out."
967,00:47:35.73,00:47:38.43,I think we shouldjust fight it out
968,00:47:38.43,00:47:41.37,and pick whoever we wantedto pick.
969,00:47:47.63,00:47:49.03,"PROBST:Matt, are you surprised at all"
970,00:47:49.03,00:47:51.53,-that Rob's tryingto make a deal? -Little bit.
971,00:47:51.53,00:47:52.97,"But you know what?If I was in his position,"
972,00:47:52.97,00:47:54.73,I might be doing the same thing.I don't know.
973,00:47:54.73,00:47:57.33,I didn't do well enoughto find out.
974,00:47:58.83,00:48:01.17,PROBST: You guys are pastthe tough point.

992,00:49:28.07,00:49:31.80,but none more valuablethan that immunity necklace.
993,00:49:35.63,00:49:38.07,"Well, I knowhow you're feeling, Jenna."
994,00:49:38.07,00:49:39.27,You're guaranteed a spotin the final two.
995,00:49:39.27,00:49:41.20,You're in the driver's seat.
996,00:49:41.20,00:49:43.60,"How you feeling, Rob? You hungin there as long as you could."
997,00:49:43.60,00:49:45.70,I did...I did the best I could.
998,00:49:45.70,00:49:47.53,"Uh, you know, I-I don't feel"
999,00:49:47.53,00:49:49.20,"like I'm in a great positionright now,"
1000,00:49:49.20,00:49:50.93,but what can I doat this point?
1001,00:49:50.93,00:49:52.73,-But a great job by Jenna.-PROBST: Matthew...
1002,00:49:52.73,00:49:55.13,"Matthew, you were the first out,and you were out quickly."
1003,00:49:55.13,00:49:57.20,"Are you worried that Jennamight say, ""You know what,"
1004,00:49:57.20,00:49:58.57,"you don't deserve it""?"
1005,00:49:58.57,00:49:59.87,"I did my best, you know."
1006,00:49:59.87,00:50:01.33,I was exhausted today.
1007,00:50:01.33,00:50:03.27,It affected my performance.
1008,00:50:03.27,00:50:06.90,"Um, Jenna didan exceptional job."
1009,00:50:06.90,00:50:08.90,She won. She deserves it.
1010,00:50:08.90,00:50:10.47,She'll make the right decision.
1011,00:50:10.47,00:50:13.57,-It's her decision to make.-So what do you base it on?
1012,00:50:13.57,00:50:15.07,We talk about this all the timeat Tribal Council.
1013,00:50:15.07,00:50:16.67,What do you base votes on?
1014,00:50:16.67,00:50:20.03,"Um, I think it's someoneI think deserves it,"
1015,00:50:20.03,00:50:21.47,someone I think's worked hard.
1016,00:50:21.47,00:50:23.60,"Um, also, like I said,"
1017,00:50:23.60,00:50:27.07,good competition at the endis important for me.
1018,00:50:27.07,00:50:28.50,So you don't want to nec...
1019,00:50:28.50,00:50:29.87,I don't want someoneI can beat.
1020,00:50:29.87,00:50:31.90,So you're not going to pickthe easy mark.
1021,00:50:31.90,00:50:34.33,"No, because that's...I-I feel like winning"
1022,00:50:34.33,00:50:36.30,"is beatingyour best competition,"
1023,00:50:36.30,00:50:38.33,and I really meant thatwhen I said it.
1024,00:50:38.33,00:50:41.13,"PROBST: And you're willingto risk $900,000--"
1025,00:50:41.13,00:50:43.80,the difference between a millionand second place-- on that?
1026,00:50:43.80,00:50:46.33,"But I feel like I've playedthe game well,"
1027,00:50:46.33,00:50:49.70,so I feel like good competitionsnever hurt.
1028,00:50:49.70,00:50:51.50,"So, Jenna, you havea big, big decision."
1029,00:50:51.50,00:50:54.53,-Are you ready to make it?-Yes.
1030,00:50:54.53,00:50:56.23,"Rob, you can't vote for Jenna."
1031,00:50:56.23,00:50:57.87,-You can only vote for Matthew.-Understood.
1032,00:50:57.87,00:50:59.00,"Matthew, you can't votefor Jenna."
1033,00:50:59.00,00:51:00.17,You can only vote for Rob.
1034,00:51:00.17,00:51:01.53,You two cancel each other out.
1035,00:51:01.53,00:51:03.50,"Therefore, the only personvoting is Jenna."
1036,00:51:03.50,00:51:07.17,"Jenna, in casting this vote,you are simultaneously"
1037,00:51:07.17,00:51:10.27,voting out the 14th memberand deciding
1038,00:51:10.27,00:51:12.40,who you're taking with youto the final two.
1039,00:51:12.40,00:51:14.90,It is time to vote.Jenna.
1040,00:51:21.83,00:51:22.83,"-Mateo.-Good luck, dude."
1041,00:51:22.83,00:51:24.40,-Good luck.-May the best man
1042,00:51:24.40,00:51:25.93,go to the final two.
1043,00:51:47.87,00:51:49.30,I'll go get the vote.
1044,00:52:00.50,00:52:02.43,"Once the vote is read,the decision is final."
1045,00:52:02.43,00:52:04.13,Person voted outwill be asked to leave
1046,00:52:04.13,00:52:05.50,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
1047,00:52:05.50,00:52:07.73,I will read the vote.
1048,00:52:13.17,00:52:15.93,"The 14th person voted out,"
1049,00:52:15.93,00:52:17.50,and the last memberof our jury...
1050,00:52:20.47,00:52:21.47,Rob.
1051,00:52:21.47,00:52:22.47,It's okay. It's okay.
1052,00:52:22.47,00:52:23.93,PROBST:Need to bring me your torch.
1053,00:52:23.93,00:52:25.00,"Good luck, dude."
1054,00:52:33.83,00:52:35.27,"Rob, the tribe has spoken."
1055,00:52:37.87,00:52:39.60,It's time for you to go.
1056,00:52:47.33,00:52:50.83,"Well, Matt and Jenna,congratulations."
1057,00:52:50.83,00:52:52.27,You've worked hard to get here.
1058,00:52:52.27,00:52:55.10,You've gone as faras you can go in this game.
1059,00:52:55.10,00:52:58.00,The power now shiftsto the jury.
1060,00:52:58.00,00:53:01.60,There'll be one final TribalCouncil where you will get
1061,00:53:01.60,00:53:03.27,a chance to state your case
1062,00:53:03.27,00:53:06.83,as to why you deserve the titleof sole Survivor
1063,00:53:06.83,00:53:09.43,and the rewardof a million dollars.
1064,00:53:09.43,00:53:12.97,You have tonight and tomorrowto think about that.
1065,00:53:12.97,00:53:14.40,Head back to camp.
1066,00:53:14.40,00:53:16.53,Good night.
1067,00:53:24.27,00:53:25.90,"ROB: Well, what can I say?"
1068,00:53:25.90,00:53:28.23,38 days out here in the Amazon.
1069,00:53:28.23,00:53:30.20,"I have, honestly, no complaints."
1070,00:53:30.20,00:53:32.10,I wouldn't change one thingabout how I played the game.
1071,00:53:32.10,00:53:36.07, Most tremendous time of my entire life.
1072,00:53:36.07,00:53:37.70,I said I wasn't goingto stop smiling
1073,00:53:37.70,00:53:39.77,"until they put my torch out,and you know what?"
1074,00:53:39.77,00:53:40.80,I'm still smiling.
1075,00:53:59.43,00:54:01.43,JENNA:Where's the white paint?
1076,00:54:01.43,00:54:03.60,MATTHEW: You got to comeright by my side.
1077,00:54:03.60,00:54:05.73,"-I am.-Add this, too."
1078,00:54:06.30,00:54:08.83,JENNA: Last time we will everdo this in the Amazon.
1079,00:54:08.83,00:54:10.90,And we're the only two peoplehere to witness it.
1080,00:54:10.90,00:54:12.80,I'll put my fingerprinton the tree.
1081,00:54:12.80,00:54:16.20,-Yep. -Just in case anybodywants to arrest me.
1082,00:54:16.20,00:54:18.90,MATTHEW: Now it's day 39. It's over.
1083,00:54:18.90,00:54:20.00, It's wrap-up time.
1084,00:54:20.00,00:54:21.33," Yeah, I can say I'm..."
1085,00:54:21.33,00:54:22.90,"I'm a bit sad, you know,"
1086,00:54:22.90,00:54:25.73,"to see it all kind of, uh,come to an end."
1087,00:54:25.73,00:54:29.83,"Just been an amazing,unforgettable experience."
1088,00:54:29.83,00:54:32.60,(thunder rumbling)
1089,00:54:41.30,00:54:44.17,JENNA: The weather's been horrid-- terrible rain--
1090,00:54:44.17,00:54:46.57," so we decided to take a look back,"
1091,00:54:46.57,00:54:48.20," and, um, we're going to kind of write"
1092,00:54:48.20,00:54:49.73,everybody's name in white paint
1093,00:54:49.73,00:54:51.27, in the order they got kicked off.
1094,00:54:51.27,00:54:53.63," It's just about the memories, the people,"
1095,00:54:53.63,00:54:55.70,"all of that,because it's all important."
1096,00:54:58.87,00:55:00.10,MATTHEW:Ryan.
1097,00:55:00.10,00:55:01.90,JENNA:‚ô™ Ryan. ‚ô™
1098,00:55:01.90,00:55:04.63,-JENNA: First person voted off. -MATTHEW: Voted off. Ryan...
1099,00:55:04.63,00:55:06.87," -I remember him as being a pretty decent guy. -He, um..."
1100,00:55:06.87,00:55:10.50,"JENNA: Janet, I thought, like, was my, like, mom in the game."
1101,00:55:10.50,00:55:12.63," -Yeah? -Like, she was so motherly and so caring and..."
1102,00:55:12.63,00:55:14.37,MATTHEW: Voted off-- Dan.
1103,00:55:14.37,00:55:16.40,JENNA: Dan! Another one I didn't get to meet.
1104,00:55:16.40,00:55:19.70,"MATTHEW: He was a decent guy,and it was tough to see him go."
1105,00:55:19.70,00:55:22.00," -Joanna. -You never met Joanna, either."
1106,00:55:22.00,00:55:24.23,MATTHEW: A lot of the guys in our tribe really thought
1107,00:55:24.23,00:55:26.53, that she was probably pretty tough to deal with.
1108,00:55:26.53,00:55:29.47," Now, the fifth person voted out was Jeanne, correct?"
1109,00:55:29.47,00:55:30.87,"JENNA: Mm-hmm. The merge, right?"
1110,00:55:30.87,00:55:32.63, But she definitely was a hard worker nonstop.
1111,00:55:32.63,00:55:34.00,MATTHEW: Right.
1112,00:55:34.00,00:55:37.03,"JENNA: And, um... oh, Shawna."
1113,00:55:37.03,00:55:39.37,"MATTHEW: Shawna, Shawna. I remember Shawna."
1114,00:55:39.37,00:55:41.10," So that's six. Now, the seventh person"
1115,00:55:41.10,00:55:43.50,"voted out, I believe, is Roger."
1116,00:55:43.50,00:55:44.63, -Correct? -Roger!
1117,00:55:44.63,00:55:46.70,MATTHEW: Roger-- everyone's favorite.
1118,00:55:46.70,00:55:48.87, So the next person is Dave.
1119,00:55:48.87,00:55:50.70, -Boo-yah! -Boo-yah!
1120,00:55:50.70,00:55:52.17, -Bangarang! -Bangarang!
1121,00:55:52.17,00:55:53.67,JENNA: I'll never forget that.
1122,00:55:53.67,00:55:55.63, Deena.
1123,00:55:55.63,00:55:58.50," I think that Deena is a strong, strong woman,"
1124,00:55:58.50,00:56:00.60, and that's great character to have.
1125,00:56:00.60,00:56:02.90,"MATTHEW: All right, that's nine. Number ten is Alex."
1126,00:56:02.90,00:56:05.27,"JENNA: Yes, and I had a really good time with him at the,"
1127,00:56:05.27,00:56:06.87," um, Amazon Cafe after he won the reward..."
1128,00:56:06.87,00:56:08.97,-MATTHEW: So it's going to be number 11-- Christy. -Yes.
1129,00:56:08.97,00:56:11.17,"MATTHEW: You know, I found her to be probably the most"
1130,00:56:11.17,00:56:14.20, independent-minded person of all of the members of Jacar√©.
1131,00:56:14.20,00:56:16.23,-JENNA: Next. -MATTHEW: Next is Heidi.
1132,00:56:16.23,00:56:17.67, -Heidi! -Your buddy.
1133,00:56:17.67,00:56:19.70,"JENNA: Ooh, I miss her so much."
1134,00:56:19.70,00:56:22.00, I don't want to talk about her-- it'll make me cry.
1135,00:56:22.00,00:56:23.27, -Butch. -Butch.
1136,00:56:23.27,00:56:25.13,MATTHEW: My buddy Butch.
1137,00:56:25.13,00:56:27.47,I-I really enjoyed his company.
1138,00:56:27.47,00:56:29.33, He was one of the far... hardest-working...
1139,00:56:29.33,00:56:30.63,JENNA: Rob Cesternino.
1140,00:56:30.63,00:56:33.07,"MATTHEW: Robasu. I owe him so much,"
1141,00:56:33.07,00:56:35.37," because when I came into the game, I..."
1142,00:56:35.37,00:56:36.87,JENNA: And that sums up 14 people
1143,00:56:36.87,00:56:38.77, that have probably changed the rest of our lives
1144,00:56:38.77,00:56:40.70, that we would have never met in real life.
1145,00:56:40.70,00:56:42.27, It's just closure to a chapter
1146,00:56:42.27,00:56:45.10,"in our life that I don't thinkwill ever be fully closed,"
1147,00:56:45.10,00:56:47.23,but we're just kind of puttingthe bookmark in it
1148,00:56:47.23,00:56:49.13, and closing it for right now.
1149,00:57:08.63,00:57:10.43,MATTHEW: It feels great
1150,00:57:10.43,00:57:13.00, that the strategic part of this game is over.
1151,00:57:13.00,00:57:15.83, It's been such an incredible evolution for me.
1152,00:57:15.83,00:57:18.60,To go from being an underdog
1153,00:57:18.60,00:57:22.67," and to have everyonegunning for me at every corner,"
1154,00:57:22.67,00:57:26.00, and to eventually learn how to build strategy
1155,00:57:26.00,00:57:29.17," and make it to the final two,"
1156,00:57:29.17,00:57:32.60,"it's almost absurd,but somehow I did it."
1157,00:57:34.23,00:57:37.27,"JENNA: 21, the youngest Survivor."
1158,00:57:37.27,00:57:39.00, I don't think I've quite realized
1159,00:57:39.00,00:57:40.70, what it's like to be in the final two.
1160,00:57:40.70,00:57:43.37,"I mean, I feel like I've worked really hard to get here,"
1161,00:57:43.37,00:57:44.83," and it's an honor, and this is"
1162,00:57:44.83,00:57:47.07,"the biggest accomplishmentin this game, and in my life,"
1163,00:57:47.07,00:57:49.40,and I don't thinkit's sunk in yet.
1164,00:57:52.37,00:57:55.67,MATTHEW: I'm absolutely ecstatic to have made the final two.
1165,00:57:55.67,00:57:57.80," There was certainly luck involved,"
1166,00:57:57.80,00:58:00.20, but there was a lot of strategy.
1167,00:58:00.20,00:58:02.67,I actually threwthat final immunity challenge.
1168,00:58:02.67,00:58:07.27, I did fall off of the perch on purpose.
1169,00:58:07.27,00:58:12.13, I was convinced that whoever won would select me.
1170,00:58:12.13,00:58:14.80,"It was a huge risk,and it does reflect a lot of..."
1171,00:58:14.80,00:58:16.70,"of what I've learned from Rob,"
1172,00:58:16.70,00:58:19.67, because he really is a mastermind at this game.
1173,00:58:21.03,00:58:22.37,JENNA: This is not a vacation.
1174,00:58:22.37,00:58:23.90, When you're pressed to your limits
1175,00:58:23.90,00:58:25.83, and you have high highs and low lows
1176,00:58:25.83,00:58:28.20,"and no in-betweensand no one to turn to,"
1177,00:58:28.20,00:58:31.13, it's just really a chance to really learn about yourself
1178,00:58:31.13,00:58:33.17, and learn about how you feel about your life
1179,00:58:33.17,00:58:34.43, and really learn
1180,00:58:34.43,00:58:35.73,about other people.
1181,00:58:38.13,00:58:39.77,MATTHEW: I will come out of this
1182,00:58:39.77,00:58:42.30, with a different perspective on life.
1183,00:58:42.30,00:58:47.27," I'm a very intense individual, maybe too much so."
1184,00:58:47.27,00:58:51.23,"I should really go outand enjoy life,"
1185,00:58:51.23,00:58:53.40,"uh, more than I have."
1186,00:58:53.40,00:58:56.30," Spend more time watching TV,"
1187,00:58:56.30,00:58:58.13, versus how I've led my life to date.
1188,00:58:58.13,00:58:59.70," For instance, I could spend"
1189,00:58:59.70,00:59:02.73,20 hours on a weekendstudying Swedish.
1190,00:59:04.37,00:59:06.23,-Two different types of fish.-I'm starving.
1191,00:59:06.23,00:59:07.77,JENNA: Don't underestimate people
1192,00:59:07.77,00:59:09.57, because they're a woman
1193,00:59:09.57,00:59:12.43, or because they're small or skinny or something.
1194,00:59:12.43,00:59:15.00,Being here taught me that Ican push beyond my limits
1195,00:59:15.00,00:59:16.57,"way beyond I ever could think,"
1196,00:59:16.57,00:59:18.70," and that is, like, a valuable life lesson,"
1197,00:59:18.70,00:59:19.93, especially for me being so young.
1198,00:59:19.93,00:59:21.07," Like, I feel like"
1199,00:59:21.07,00:59:22.77,I can do anything right now.
1200,00:59:22.77,00:59:25.80,"Anything that you throw at me,I can handle."
1201,00:59:41.80,00:59:43.07,"MATTHEW: I was out fishing,"
1202,00:59:43.07,00:59:44.77," and it was the tail end of my fishing trip,"
1203,00:59:44.77,00:59:46.23," just getting ready to wrap things up,"
1204,00:59:46.23,00:59:48.50," and I noticed that, uh, the boat that we've been using"
1205,00:59:48.50,00:59:50.63, for the last two weeks was floating nearby.
1206,00:59:50.63,00:59:53.13,I guess that we forgotto tether it
1207,00:59:53.13,00:59:56.73,"once we, um, boardedthe, um, seaplane yesterday."
1208,00:59:58.37,01:00:00.63,I don't think we're going to be needing it much longer.
1209,01:00:00.63,01:00:02.27, It is the 39th day.
1210,01:00:02.27,01:00:04.63," So I'm going to tug it back to camp,"
1211,01:00:04.63,01:00:07.07," and I've got some ideas how we can, uh, use it."
1212,01:00:08.97,01:00:12.93, My plan is to stockpile some wood inside
1213,01:00:12.93,01:00:15.43, and plant our treemail dude on top
1214,01:00:15.43,01:00:18.23, along with some artifacts from our campsite.
1215,01:00:22.57,01:00:26.90, And basically light it on fire and send it off.
1216,01:00:26.90,01:00:28.97,I think it's a great wayto get some closure
1217,01:00:28.97,01:00:30.53,on this whole experience.
1218,01:00:32.40,01:00:34.27,I want to have himface this way.
1219,01:00:34.27,01:00:36.00,Okay.
1220,01:00:36.00,01:00:37.10,That looks good.
1221,01:00:37.10,01:00:39.00,Yep.
1222,01:00:40.33,01:00:41.90,-Treemail dude.-Very nice.
1223,01:00:46.90,01:00:48.33,-Let's torch it.-Yeah.
1224,01:00:58.23,01:01:00.10,JENNA:I'm ready to see it burn.
1225,01:01:00.10,01:01:01.23,"All right,I'm going to step back."
1226,01:01:01.23,01:01:03.13,You ready to lightthis baby?
1227,01:01:08.80,01:01:11.00,JENNA:Whoo!
1228,01:01:11.00,01:01:12.63,That was great!
1229,01:01:12.63,01:01:14.97,"-Are you all right?-Yeah, I'm fine. (mutters)"
1230,01:01:14.97,01:01:17.03,-That's cool.-Push that bad boy out there.
1231,01:01:17.03,01:01:19.03,Whoo!
1232,01:01:19.03,01:01:21.30,(Jenna laughs)
1233,01:01:25.40,01:01:27.30,"JENNA:All right, let it go."
1234,01:01:30.13,01:01:32.03,Very cool.
1235,01:01:34.30,01:01:36.70,JENNA: It's over. It's out of our hands.
1236,01:01:36.70,01:01:38.33, We have done all we can do.
1237,01:01:38.33,01:01:40.60,The jury will come back tonight with questions.
1238,01:01:40.60,01:01:42.63," That's kind of, like, our last chance to..."
1239,01:01:42.63,01:01:45.83,really cement what we feelabout ourself and them
1240,01:01:45.83,01:01:47.47,one last time to the jury.
1241,01:01:47.47,01:01:49.33,I do feel like the m-majorityof the jury
1242,01:01:49.33,01:01:50.87,probably alreadyhas their decision made
1243,01:01:50.87,01:01:52.63,by the time they come...came there.
1244,01:01:52.63,01:01:56.00," I would, you know, um, but it's out of our hands."
1245,01:01:56.00,01:01:58.23, It's really out of our hands right now.
1246,01:01:58.23,01:02:01.20,MATTHEW: The final two:Jenna and Mateo.
1247,01:02:01.20,01:02:03.53,-We did...-Who would've thought?
1248,01:02:03.53,01:02:04.93,All right. Let's go.
1249,01:02:04.93,01:02:06.17,Let's wrap it up.
1250,01:02:06.17,01:02:08.20,Let's head to our final TC.
1251,01:02:14.90,01:02:18.33,"ROB: This game began as a battle of the sexes,"
1252,01:02:18.33,01:02:21.67," and in the end, it shall be as it was in the beginning--"
1253,01:02:21.67,01:02:23.70, a man versus a woman.
1254,01:02:23.70,01:02:25.97,"I think both of themhave played this game dishonest,"
1255,01:02:25.97,01:02:28.17,and both of them claimto be honest players
1256,01:02:28.17,01:02:30.07,who've played this gamewith integrity.
1257,01:02:30.07,01:02:32.10, Loyalty is out the window at this point.
1258,01:02:32.10,01:02:36.03," It's who did the best jobto outwit, outplay and outlast."
1259,01:02:36.03,01:02:38.07," Is it Jenna, or is it Matt?"
1260,01:02:38.07,01:02:39.87,"I wish there was a choice ""C""--"
1261,01:02:39.87,01:02:41.63,none of the above--but there isn't.
1262,01:02:48.90,01:02:53.20,"CHRISTY: Jenna is a very determined, very strong woman."
1263,01:02:53.20,01:02:55.60," I mean, she made it all the way. Go, girl."
1264,01:02:55.60,01:02:58.27,Matt is a very sincere
1265,01:02:58.27,01:03:02.50,"and very generous,very caring person that..."
1266,01:03:02.50,01:03:05.17,everyone likesif you get to know him.
1267,01:03:12.43,01:03:14.77,ALEX: The response that I'm really looking for
1268,01:03:14.77,01:03:16.33, is an honest response.
1269,01:03:16.33,01:03:18.03, We know what answers we want to hear.
1270,01:03:18.03,01:03:19.83, We know what the honest answer is.
1271,01:03:19.83,01:03:21.73, I just want to know who's honest enough to say it.
1272,01:03:21.73,01:03:24.23,"I want the person to...up there to say,"
1273,01:03:24.23,01:03:26.60,"""I played the game,I came here to kick ass,"
1274,01:03:26.60,01:03:28.73,"""I kicked ass, and that'sall there was to it."
1275,01:03:28.73,01:03:31.60," You don't like it, you should've played better."""
1276,01:03:40.27,01:03:43.07,HEIDI: Tonight's choice will be very easy for me.
1277,01:03:43.07,01:03:46.20,Jenna is...she's my number-one hero.
1278,01:03:46.20,01:03:48.80,"I just... I totally,completely adore her."
1279,01:03:48.80,01:03:50.77,"And, uh, then you've got Matt,"
1280,01:03:50.77,01:03:54.23,"who has played the gamebased on his ""honesty"" values,"
1281,01:03:54.23,01:03:56.53,"and, uh, sorry, Matt,it's just..."
1282,01:03:56.53,01:03:58.87,it's just not working for you.
1283,01:04:08.30,01:04:10.17,BUTCH: Matt is the one
1284,01:04:10.17,01:04:11.87,that contributed the most.
1285,01:04:11.87,01:04:16.27,"Matt is the one that, um,has done more for everybody,"
1286,01:04:16.27,01:04:20.20, and Matt would be the one more deserving than Jenna.
1287,01:04:26.40,01:04:28.07,DEENA: You are dealing with two
1288,01:04:28.07,01:04:29.53,completely differentpersonalities
1289,01:04:29.53,01:04:31.07,between Matt and Jenna.
1290,01:04:31.07,01:04:34.80,"Matt was the workhorse,Jenna was the sex goddess,"
1291,01:04:34.80,01:04:39.73,and the two of them used theirabilities to their advantage.
1292,01:04:39.73,01:04:42.27,Matt worked his way to the top.
1293,01:04:42.27,01:04:45.93,Jenna...played her way to the top.
1294,01:04:54.17,01:04:56.80,DAVE:It is amazing at Tribal Council
1295,01:04:56.80,01:04:59.50,to kind of look at all the bull that people throw out.
1296,01:04:59.50,01:05:01.47,It isn't friendship.
1297,01:05:01.47,01:05:03.43,It isn't honesty and integrity
1298,01:05:03.43,01:05:05.47,that's got themto this position.
1299,01:05:05.47,01:05:09.17,It's the fact that other peoplehave kind of pulled them along.
1300,01:05:09.17,01:05:11.27, I think my vote is going to be based
1301,01:05:11.27,01:05:13.50, upon their answer to my question tonight.
1302,01:05:13.50,01:05:16.40, I want them to think and give an intelligent answer
1303,01:05:16.40,01:05:18.57," and, uh... and then see if..."
1304,01:05:18.57,01:05:21.73,if they start... start talkingout of their ass again.
1305,01:05:52.77,01:05:54.53,We'll now bring in our jury.
1306,01:05:58.50,01:06:00.83,"Dave, Deena, Alex,"
1307,01:06:00.83,01:06:04.20,"Christy, Heidi, Butch"
1308,01:06:04.20,01:06:07.70,"and Rob, voted outat the last Tribal Council."
1309,01:06:18.80,01:06:21.70,Welcome to your finalTribal Council.
1310,01:06:21.70,01:06:23.80,"First of all,let me say congratulations"
1311,01:06:23.80,01:06:24.90,on making it this far.
1312,01:06:26.83,01:06:30.20,"Tonight, the game shifts--it enters the last phase."
1313,01:06:30.20,01:06:31.73,"For the past 39 days,the two of you"
1314,01:06:31.73,01:06:35.07,either directly or indirectlyhave had a hand in voting out
1315,01:06:35.07,01:06:38.27,the 14 other peoplewho you started this game with.
1316,01:06:40.53,01:06:43.50,"Tonight, you won't vote."
1317,01:06:43.50,01:06:46.40,"Tonight, the power of the voteshifts to your jury."
1318,01:06:46.40,01:06:49.47,Seven people that you had a handin voting out
1319,01:06:49.47,01:06:52.67,now hold your fateentirely in their hands.
1320,01:06:52.67,01:06:54.40,Tonight's Tribal Council
1321,01:06:54.40,01:06:57.00,is a chance for them to gatherthe information they need
1322,01:06:57.00,01:06:58.47,to help them makea big decision--
1323,01:06:58.47,01:06:59.70,which one of the two of you
1324,01:06:59.70,01:07:02.33,do they feelis the most deserving
1325,01:07:02.33,01:07:04.20,of the title of sole Survivor
1326,01:07:04.20,01:07:06.50,and the million dollarsthat goes with it.
1327,01:07:06.50,01:07:08.63,"Matthew and Jenna, in a moment,"
1328,01:07:08.63,01:07:10.43,you're going to have a chanceto address the jury
1329,01:07:10.43,01:07:12.50,with your opening statements.
1330,01:07:12.50,01:07:14.13,Think about whatyou want to say.
1331,01:07:30.07,01:07:31.40,"PROBST: All right, we'll beginwith the opening statements."
1332,01:07:31.40,01:07:32.70,Jenna.
1333,01:07:32.70,01:07:34.80,Um... I-I don't know.
1334,01:07:34.80,01:07:36.50,I really don't have much to say.
1335,01:07:36.50,01:07:39.10,"Um, I feel like you knowenough about me"
1336,01:07:39.10,01:07:41.13,"in order to makean educated decision,"
1337,01:07:41.13,01:07:42.50,which I know that you will.
1338,01:07:42.50,01:07:44.90,"I feel like I've playedthis game morally,"
1339,01:07:44.90,01:07:47.00,and that means a lot to me.
1340,01:07:47.00,01:07:49.83,"And so I feel like you'll makethe right decision,"
1341,01:07:49.83,01:07:52.43,so I'm justgoing to end it right there.
1342,01:07:52.43,01:07:54.10,Matthew.
1343,01:07:54.10,01:07:57.20,"Um, you know, I've done my bestto provide for the tribe."
1344,01:07:57.20,01:07:58.67,I've been out fishing.
1345,01:07:58.67,01:08:00.97,"You know, I think that, um,I've shown"
1346,01:08:00.97,01:08:05.30,"that, um, I am dedicatedto the tribe a-as a whole."
1347,01:08:05.30,01:08:09.33,"I feel that I have also shownthat I am a serious competitor,"
1348,01:08:09.33,01:08:11.60,"that I play with heart,"
1349,01:08:11.60,01:08:13.97,"that I have a...a never-say-die attitude,"
1350,01:08:13.97,01:08:15.57,and I believethat I've been able
1351,01:08:15.57,01:08:19.50,to play the game honorablyand maintain a level
1352,01:08:19.50,01:08:22.77,"of morality and integrity,uh, throughout."
1353,01:08:22.77,01:08:26.17,And I just wantedto share that with you.
1354,01:08:26.17,01:08:27.47,"PROBST:All right, jury."
1355,01:08:27.47,01:08:29.40,You've had a chance to heartheir opening comments
1356,01:08:29.40,01:08:30.57,about why they feelthey're most deserving.
1357,01:08:30.57,01:08:32.57,Now it's a chance for you
1358,01:08:32.57,01:08:34.23,to get a little moreinformation.
1359,01:08:34.23,01:08:35.30,"You can make a comment,"
1360,01:08:35.30,01:08:37.10,"and if you want,you can ask a question."
1361,01:08:37.10,01:08:39.63,"Butch, you're first."
1362,01:08:42.83,01:08:44.17,"Matt and Jenna,congratulations."
1363,01:08:44.17,01:08:45.80,"-Thank you, Butch.-I want to address"
1364,01:08:45.80,01:08:47.70,this questionto the both of you.
1365,01:08:47.70,01:08:48.70,(rustling)
1366,01:08:48.70,01:08:51.27,-Heads up.-Whoa! -Whoa. -Whoa.
1367,01:08:51.27,01:08:53.00,-Wow.-(Butch sighs)
1368,01:08:53.00,01:08:54.77,"Butch, maybe you betterrethink that question."
1369,01:08:54.77,01:08:56.07,(laughter)
1370,01:08:56.07,01:08:57.20,-All right.-Dude.
1371,01:08:57.20,01:08:58.80,"PROBST:Hey, the Amazon is speaking."
1372,01:08:58.80,01:09:00.27,"Let's keep it going, guys."
1373,01:09:00.27,01:09:02.43,-Okay. (clears throat)-You were saying?
1374,01:09:02.43,01:09:04.87,My question is addressedto the both of you.
1375,01:09:04.87,01:09:08.57,"I've heard tonight the word""integrity"" and ""honesty."""
1376,01:09:08.57,01:09:11.70,Are you telling me-- yes or no--
1377,01:09:11.70,01:09:16.10,"that you have not lied,that you were not deceitful"
1378,01:09:16.10,01:09:18.43,during our time together?
1379,01:09:18.43,01:09:20.67,I'd like to havea yes or no answer.
1380,01:09:20.67,01:09:22.13,Jenna.
1381,01:09:22.13,01:09:24.87,"Yes, I did lie to Deenawhen she asked me if..."
1382,01:09:24.87,01:09:26.43,"who I was voting for that nightat Tribal Council,"
1383,01:09:26.43,01:09:28.03,"and I was voting for her,and I..."
1384,01:09:28.03,01:09:30.83,"did not tell her I was votingfor her only because, um,"
1385,01:09:30.83,01:09:33.17,"I felt like she betrayed meand betrayed the alliance,"
1386,01:09:33.17,01:09:36.57,and I felt like it wasthe only necessary move to make.
1387,01:09:36.57,01:09:37.83,Thank you.
1388,01:09:37.83,01:09:39.07,Matthew.
1389,01:09:39.07,01:09:41.40,"Yes, I have lied.I lied to Roger."
1390,01:09:41.40,01:09:43.23,"He's not a member of the jury,"
1391,01:09:43.23,01:09:47.10,"but I lied to him as part of,um, an alliance strategy"
1392,01:09:47.10,01:09:50.03,at the time to eliminate him.
1393,01:09:50.03,01:09:55.37,And I deceived Alexin order to save my own skin.
1394,01:09:55.37,01:09:57.67,"-I appreciate your answers.-Thanks, Butch."
1395,01:09:57.67,01:09:59.57,Thank you.
1396,01:09:59.57,01:10:00.33,Rob.
1397,01:10:04.83,01:10:08.77,I would like to hearwhy you think
1398,01:10:08.77,01:10:11.20,the person next to youdoes not deserve
1399,01:10:11.20,01:10:13.23,to be here in the final two.
1400,01:10:13.23,01:10:16.50,Your answer to my questionwill determine my vote.
1401,01:10:16.50,01:10:17.73,Matthew.
1402,01:10:17.73,01:10:22.00,"I think that Jenna has, um,"
1403,01:10:22.00,01:10:27.00,not done as much as the restof us to contribute at camp.
1404,01:10:27.00,01:10:30.00,"I haven't seen hercollect water, boil water,"
1405,01:10:30.00,01:10:32.90,"um, gather wood, um,"
1406,01:10:32.90,01:10:34.33,help with the shelter.
1407,01:10:34.33,01:10:37.17,There were times when she
1408,01:10:37.17,01:10:39.23,"had expressed a desireto give up in the game,"
1409,01:10:39.23,01:10:42.87,"and I felt that, uh,that was, um,"
1410,01:10:42.87,01:10:44.40,really inappropriateand really affected
1411,01:10:44.40,01:10:45.87,my feelings towards her.
1412,01:10:45.87,01:10:47.23,PROBST:Jenna.
1413,01:10:47.23,01:10:49.23,"Um, I don't think Matthew"
1414,01:10:49.23,01:10:50.87,has played the gamefrom the beginning.
1415,01:10:50.87,01:10:52.67,I think he took the opportunity
1416,01:10:52.67,01:10:54.37,to tag alongat the end of an alliance.
1417,01:10:54.37,01:10:56.10,"Um, he doesn't need the money,"
1418,01:10:56.10,01:10:58.37,"he doesn't careabout the people here,"
1419,01:10:58.37,01:11:01.47,"and, um, I just don't feellike this is a big deal for him."
1420,01:11:01.47,01:11:02.80,I feel like it's justanother adventure
1421,01:11:02.80,01:11:05.00,on his list of things to do.
1422,01:11:05.00,01:11:06.27,"PROBST:Thanks, Rob."
1423,01:11:10.03,01:11:10.67,Alex.
1424,01:11:13.70,01:11:14.70,"Hey, you guys."
1425,01:11:14.70,01:11:18.57,"You know, we've sataround this... on the jury,"
1426,01:11:18.57,01:11:20.33,"listened to you guysat Tribal Council,"
1427,01:11:20.33,01:11:22.80,"and, um, the two wordsthat I never,"
1428,01:11:22.80,01:11:26.03,"ever want to hear againare ""honesty"" and ""integrity."""
1429,01:11:26.03,01:11:28.50,Those words have no meaningto me anymore.
1430,01:11:28.50,01:11:31.13,I want to know from each of you
1431,01:11:31.13,01:11:33.57,what your biggest regretin this game is.
1432,01:11:33.57,01:11:36.00,If there was one thing that youcould go back and change
1433,01:11:36.00,01:11:37.60,"about the waythat you've played this game,"
1434,01:11:37.60,01:11:39.90,what is it and why?
1435,01:11:39.90,01:11:41.27,Jenna.
1436,01:11:41.27,01:11:43.30,I think my biggest regretlooking back in this game
1437,01:11:43.30,01:11:45.30,is puttinga little bit too much trust
1438,01:11:45.30,01:11:47.43,in peoplethat I couldn't trust.
1439,01:11:47.43,01:11:49.50,"You know, why would somebodybe honest to me all the time"
1440,01:11:49.50,01:11:50.53,when they have a chanceto be dishonest
1441,01:11:50.53,01:11:51.53,and win a million dollars?
1442,01:11:51.53,01:11:53.33,"So I think that was, uh,"
1443,01:11:53.33,01:11:56.07,definitely one of my faults.
1444,01:11:56.07,01:11:57.17,Matthew.
1445,01:11:57.17,01:12:00.47,"My biggest regret, really,"
1446,01:12:00.47,01:12:03.40,is my na√Øvet√©
1447,01:12:03.40,01:12:05.93,when I began the game
1448,01:12:05.93,01:12:09.07,and my decision initially
1449,01:12:09.07,01:12:13.17,to support Ryan
1450,01:12:13.17,01:12:17.17,"and his, um, allianceand voting strategy"
1451,01:12:17.17,01:12:19.10,that started this whole process
1452,01:12:19.10,01:12:20.73,of people regarding meas a threat.
1453,01:12:20.73,01:12:23.73,And it resultedin two weeks of...
1454,01:12:23.73,01:12:26.63,of-of near depression for me.
1455,01:12:26.63,01:12:29.00,Thanks.
1456,01:12:29.00,01:12:29.90,Heidi.
1457,01:12:33.47,01:12:35.70,"Hey, guys.Congratulations."
1458,01:12:35.70,01:12:38.03,"Um, I understandthat the two of you"
1459,01:12:38.03,01:12:41.23,"are trying to outdoeach other here, but since, uh,"
1460,01:12:41.23,01:12:43.53,"we're a part of the juryand we're deciding your fate,"
1461,01:12:43.53,01:12:45.63,I'd like to know if thereis a particular person here
1462,01:12:45.63,01:12:48.57,that would be more deservingto be in your position.
1463,01:12:48.57,01:12:51.60,"And, uh, if you don'tfeel that way, that's fine."
1464,01:12:51.60,01:12:52.80,If you thinkyou're more deserving
1465,01:12:52.80,01:12:54.63,"than any of us, that's fine,"
1466,01:12:54.63,01:12:56.07,but please explain why.
1467,01:12:56.07,01:12:57.23,-Matthew.-MATTHEW: Yeah.
1468,01:12:57.23,01:13:00.13,"I would say that, um..."
1469,01:13:00.13,01:13:03.00,"I think Rob deserves my seat,"
1470,01:13:03.00,01:13:08.03,because I think he's provento be an amazing strategist.
1471,01:13:08.03,01:13:11.00,"I am in debt to him forever,because"
1472,01:13:11.00,01:13:15.27,"without Rob and without his...I-I would even call it tutelage,"
1473,01:13:15.27,01:13:17.53,there's no waythat I would be here today.
1474,01:13:17.53,01:13:19.73,I would've been wiped outa long time ago.
1475,01:13:19.73,01:13:24.30,"If I had won immunity yesterday,Rob would be sitting next to me."
1476,01:13:24.30,01:13:28.53,I think that he deserves itmore than Jenna.
1477,01:13:30.00,01:13:31.13,Jenna.
1478,01:13:31.13,01:13:33.10,"Um, unfortunately,I'm going to have"
1479,01:13:33.10,01:13:34.33,to echo Matt and say Rob.
1480,01:13:34.33,01:13:36.33,When it comes downto strategical game play
1481,01:13:36.33,01:13:39.93,"and just general wealthof knowledge of the game,"
1482,01:13:39.93,01:13:42.37,Rob has all thatencompassed into one.
1483,01:13:42.37,01:13:44.17,So that's my answer.
1484,01:13:44.17,01:13:47.57,"I mean, just... I think that...is that the only person?"
1485,01:13:50.87,01:13:52.83,-I think they covered it. Yeah.-Okay.
1486,01:13:52.83,01:13:55.03,"-Okay. Is that it? Uh-huh.-Thanks, Heidi."
1487,01:13:55.03,01:13:56.10,Deena.
1488,01:13:58.57,01:14:01.30,"I've been sitting herelistening,"
1489,01:14:01.30,01:14:03.60,"but as I listened to oneof your responses, Jenna,"
1490,01:14:03.60,01:14:04.87,I was a little concerned.
1491,01:14:04.87,01:14:08.30,Because you said Mattshouldn't be there
1492,01:14:08.30,01:14:11.00,because he doesn't needthe money.
1493,01:14:11.00,01:14:12.57,Do you honestly think
1494,01:14:12.57,01:14:16.37,that the waythat we should judge our vote
1495,01:14:16.37,01:14:18.53,is based on need
1496,01:14:18.53,01:14:20.63,and not the way that the otherperson played the game?
1497,01:14:20.63,01:14:22.73,I-I think that need
1498,01:14:22.73,01:14:25.30,should come into it becausethat's just personally how I
1499,01:14:25.30,01:14:26.80,would go about votingif I was on the jury.
1500,01:14:26.80,01:14:28.13,"I know everybody's different,"
1501,01:14:28.13,01:14:31.60,but that's personallyhow I feel I would do it.
1502,01:14:31.60,01:14:35.67,"Okay. A-And, Matt, you veryboldly and very clearly stated"
1503,01:14:35.67,01:14:38.87,"a couple of Tribal Councils ago,""May the best man win,"""
1504,01:14:38.87,01:14:40.83,to which I was offendedon Jenna's behalf.
1505,01:14:40.83,01:14:42.67,I don't knowif she was offended.
1506,01:14:42.67,01:14:43.83,I thought that was a loadof hooey.
1507,01:14:43.83,01:14:46.70,And... and it was basedon your alliance
1508,01:14:46.70,01:14:48.87,with Butch and with Roband with yourself.
1509,01:14:48.87,01:14:50.90,"Yeah, I don't remember saying,"
1510,01:14:50.90,01:14:52.90,"""May the best man win,""but if I did,"
1511,01:14:52.90,01:14:54.80,I completely regret it
1512,01:14:54.80,01:14:57.57,because I'm not a...I'm not a chauvinist.
1513,01:14:57.57,01:15:01.13,"And I'm happy you pointed thatout, because perhaps it did"
1514,01:15:01.13,01:15:03.97,reflect the fact that I thoughtwe had it all locked up.
1515,01:15:03.97,01:15:05.23,All right. Thank you.
1516,01:15:05.23,01:15:07.23,"-Thanks, Deena.-Thanks."
1517,01:15:07.23,01:15:08.20,Christy.
1518,01:15:09.50,01:15:11.87,"(sighs)Hello, you guys."
1519,01:15:13.40,01:15:14.93,I think I'll go with Matt.
1520,01:15:14.93,01:15:18.20,What was your firstinitial reaction
1521,01:15:18.20,01:15:19.97,when you found outyou were competing
1522,01:15:19.97,01:15:22.03,with a deaf woman like me?
1523,01:15:22.03,01:15:24.50,My initial reaction was
1524,01:15:24.50,01:15:28.63,that you were going to be reallyjust like everyone else.
1525,01:15:28.63,01:15:31.37,"Um, I didn't treat youany differently."
1526,01:15:31.37,01:15:33.27,So your opinion insidenever changed
1527,01:15:33.27,01:15:35.17,when you first found outthat you were competing...
1528,01:15:35.17,01:15:36.50,"No, not at all.Not at all."
1529,01:15:36.50,01:15:38.30,I thought you hada funky accent.
1530,01:15:38.30,01:15:39.60,-That's all.-(laughing)
1531,01:15:39.60,01:15:41.47,"Okay. Jenna,"
1532,01:15:41.47,01:15:43.93,I found it very fascinating
1533,01:15:43.93,01:15:46.03,when you saidthat you had a handicap
1534,01:15:46.03,01:15:47.40,because you're beautiful.
1535,01:15:47.40,01:15:49.87,"And I am sitting there, like,"
1536,01:15:49.87,01:15:52.77,"""Hmm.""How... how is that a handicap?"
1537,01:15:52.77,01:15:55.40,"I-I've never, ever...outside in the real world,"
1538,01:15:55.40,01:15:57.17,I've never heard anybody saythat they
1539,01:15:57.17,01:15:58.50,have a handicapbecause they're beautiful.
1540,01:15:58.50,01:16:00.93,So I would like youto explain that to me.
1541,01:16:00.93,01:16:02.67,-Okay.-I-I don't...
1542,01:16:02.67,01:16:04.70,"I don't know if I everused the word ""handicap."""
1543,01:16:04.70,01:16:07.00,"-I can't find it... -I rememberyou used the word ""handicap."""
1544,01:16:07.00,01:16:10.10,"-Okay. I... -Um, do you guysremember hearing that? Okay."
1545,01:16:10.10,01:16:12.80,I-I was asked a questionabout how I felt
1546,01:16:12.80,01:16:15.17,like I was perceivedwhen I came into this game.
1547,01:16:15.17,01:16:18.23,By no means did I meanto compare it in any way
1548,01:16:18.23,01:16:20.67,to what you are going through.
1549,01:16:20.67,01:16:23.90,"Okay, so you felt like basicallyfrom day one to now"
1550,01:16:23.90,01:16:26.80,that you have had a handicapbecause you're beautiful?
1551,01:16:26.80,01:16:28.77,JENNA:I didn't mean it like that.
1552,01:16:28.77,01:16:32.67,I thought because of me being 21and attractive-looking
1553,01:16:32.67,01:16:34.57,and being a swimsuit modelthat people would
1554,01:16:34.57,01:16:37.63,automatically judge meas someone who was not tough
1555,01:16:37.63,01:16:39.90,and not smartand couldn't think for themself.
1556,01:16:39.90,01:16:42.73,"And that's what I meantby ""handicap."""
1557,01:16:42.73,01:16:44.83,-I'm sorry if you were offended.-Okay.
1558,01:16:47.03,01:16:49.50,"Dave, the last jury member."
1559,01:16:51.53,01:16:53.67,(clears throat)Evening.
1560,01:16:53.67,01:16:56.93,My question for both of you is:
1561,01:16:56.93,01:16:59.80,What modern influential leader
1562,01:16:59.80,01:17:02.33,have you emulatedduring this game?
1563,01:17:02.33,01:17:05.80,And what qualities do you feel
1564,01:17:05.80,01:17:08.77,from that individualthat you have shown best?
1565,01:17:08.77,01:17:12.50,I'm trying to get somebodythat... that I can relate to--
1566,01:17:12.50,01:17:15.17,"a-a name of-of somebodythat I would say,"
1567,01:17:15.17,01:17:18.57,"""All right, Matt's done thislike this person."""
1568,01:17:18.57,01:17:19.57,Matthew.
1569,01:17:19.57,01:17:22.83,"I would say, um, Colin Powell."
1570,01:17:22.83,01:17:25.83,"His whole concept of...of versatility,"
1571,01:17:25.83,01:17:29.77,"um, was a critical factorin my ability to..."
1572,01:17:29.77,01:17:33.40,to be here seatedin this seat today.
1573,01:17:35.00,01:17:36.53,Jenna.
1574,01:17:36.53,01:17:39.07,"Um, I think that'sa really g-great question,"
1575,01:17:39.07,01:17:41.27,"but honestly, I...I cannot think"
1576,01:17:41.27,01:17:43.00,of a modern leaderthat I emulated.
1577,01:17:43.00,01:17:45.83,"I choose to emulate people thatI know really well, becau..."
1578,01:17:45.83,01:17:47.70,not just what I seeon TV or read.
1579,01:17:47.70,01:17:50.17,"Um, that person that I doemulate, I think, is my mom."
1580,01:17:50.17,01:17:53.17,"I mean, I emulate my mom and dadboth, and I gain from both,"
1581,01:17:53.17,01:17:56.27,"but mostly my mom, just becauseof her fight and strength,"
1582,01:17:56.27,01:17:58.37,and I think those are tworeally important qualities
1583,01:17:58.37,01:18:01.43,"not just to have here,but to have in real life."
1584,01:18:03.03,01:18:05.07,-Are you satisfied with that?-I'm satisfied.
1585,01:18:05.07,01:18:05.97,PROBST:Great. Thank you.
1586,01:18:08.33,01:18:09.97,"Okay, jury, you've had a chanceto hear from the final two."
1587,01:18:09.97,01:18:12.17,You got a chanceto ask your questions.
1588,01:18:12.17,01:18:14.23,"In a moment, you will vote."
1589,01:18:14.23,01:18:16.13,"Take a moment, think about it."
1590,01:18:41.20,01:18:43.07,"PROBST: All right.Matthew and Jenna,"
1591,01:18:43.07,01:18:45.27,you've had a chance to address.
1592,01:18:45.27,01:18:47.33,They've had a chanceto question you.
1593,01:18:47.33,01:18:49.03,This is your last shotat convincing them
1594,01:18:49.03,01:18:51.67,"why you are the mostdeserving person,"
1595,01:18:51.67,01:18:53.53,"why you deserve the titleof sole Survivor,"
1596,01:18:53.53,01:18:56.53,"and more importantly, why youdeserve a million dollars."
1597,01:18:56.53,01:18:59.80,"Jenna began this last time,so, Matthew, you will begin."
1598,01:18:59.80,01:19:03.63,I realizethat I have been deceptive
1599,01:19:03.63,01:19:08.13,"and that I have lied,and I realize that..."
1600,01:19:08.13,01:19:11.37,now that is part of the game.
1601,01:19:11.37,01:19:15.90,"Um, and I don't belongon a pedestal"
1602,01:19:15.90,01:19:19.27,because I think everyonehas done
1603,01:19:19.27,01:19:20.50,a certain amount of lying
1604,01:19:20.50,01:19:22.10,and there's beena certain amount of betrayal.
1605,01:19:22.10,01:19:26.90,"And I have, um,come to the realization that..."
1606,01:19:26.90,01:19:29.20,I do not have the levelof integrity
1607,01:19:29.20,01:19:32.73,"or the, um, high moral characterthat I preach."
1608,01:19:32.73,01:19:37.00,"And, in fact, don't deservethat... that title."
1609,01:19:37.00,01:19:38.77,And I'd just like to endby saying
1610,01:19:38.77,01:19:41.83,that I've done my best to...to play this game
1611,01:19:41.83,01:19:43.27,to the best of my ability
1612,01:19:43.27,01:19:45.97,and I've learned a lotalong the way.
1613,01:19:45.97,01:19:47.40,That's all I have to say.
1614,01:19:47.40,01:19:48.80,-Thank you.-PROBST: Jenna.
1615,01:19:48.80,01:19:51.57,"Yeah. Um, first of all,I just want to thank you guys"
1616,01:19:51.57,01:19:54.43,for really p-pokingand prodding with the questions.
1617,01:19:54.43,01:19:56.70,They really gave me a chanceto look back at things
1618,01:19:56.70,01:19:58.93,that I've done in this gamethat maybe I just wanted
1619,01:19:58.93,01:20:00.97,to put out of my mindor that I forgot.
1620,01:20:00.97,01:20:02.33,"Yeah, maybe I'm notthe strongest person"
1621,01:20:02.33,01:20:04.30,"to cut down all the trees,but I still feel"
1622,01:20:04.30,01:20:08.37,"like I've put in my,you know, work at camp,"
1623,01:20:08.37,01:20:11.20,and I do feel like I'veworked hard at the challenges.
1624,01:20:11.20,01:20:13.87,"And I... you know, I...when I came through at the end"
1625,01:20:13.87,01:20:15.67,"where I needed to save my butt,"
1626,01:20:15.67,01:20:17.47,"my determinationreally came through for me,"
1627,01:20:17.47,01:20:19.33,and I... I was really proudof myself.
1628,01:20:19.33,01:20:22.33,So it's hard for me to sayany more than that.
1629,01:20:22.33,01:20:25.00,"Okay, jury, the voting processis a little different tonight."
1630,01:20:25.00,01:20:27.47,"Tonight, you are not votingsomebody out."
1631,01:20:27.47,01:20:29.57,"Tonight, you are votingfor someone."
1632,01:20:29.57,01:20:33.27,You are voting for the personyou think is most deserving
1633,01:20:33.27,01:20:34.83,of the title of sole Survivor
1634,01:20:34.83,01:20:38.23,"and, as importantly, the milliondollars that goes with it."
1635,01:20:38.23,01:20:41.07,"So, Matthew and Jenna,you want your name"
1636,01:20:41.07,01:20:43.37,to be written down tonight.
1637,01:20:43.37,01:20:46.77,"For the last time in the Amazon,it is time to vote."
1638,01:20:46.77,01:20:48.10,"Butch, you're up."
1639,01:20:59.20,01:21:01.67,BUTCH: Congratulations to both.
1640,01:21:01.67,01:21:04.00, I'm very proud to have known both of you.
1641,01:21:04.00,01:21:05.77," But tonight, the true Survivor"
1642,01:21:05.77,01:21:07.27,is Matthew.
1643,01:21:07.27,01:21:09.33,"And, Matthew,I believe you said it all"
1644,01:21:09.33,01:21:11.00,in your opening statement.
1645,01:21:11.00,01:21:12.97, I also appreciate your honesty--
1646,01:21:12.97,01:21:15.57," that you did lie, that you did deceive."
1647,01:21:15.57,01:21:17.17, It meant a lot to me.
1648,01:21:17.17,01:21:19.70," Congratulations to both, but, Matthew,"
1649,01:21:19.70,01:21:22.93,you are the true Survivorof Survivor VI.
1650,01:21:48.57,01:21:51.60,"Jenna, I'm votingfor you tonight because"
1651,01:21:51.60,01:21:53.77, I adore you.
1652,01:21:53.77,01:21:55.27, I love you.
1653,01:21:55.27,01:21:56.90, You played the game hard.
1654,01:21:56.90,01:21:58.50," But more importantly,"
1655,01:21:58.50,01:22:02.03,you represented someonethat I could trust and respect
1656,01:22:02.03,01:22:05.07,in the most adversecircumstances.
1657,01:22:05.07,01:22:07.07,"Good luck, girl."
1658,01:22:43.33,01:22:45.90,You did show herethat you have the will
1659,01:22:45.90,01:22:50.03," and the determination it took to get to the final two,"
1660,01:22:50.03,01:22:52.23, and I'll give credit where credit is due--
1661,01:22:52.23,01:22:55.63,that there are only two players in this entire game
1662,01:22:55.63,01:22:57.30, that I didn't vote off.
1663,01:23:04.47,01:23:08.07,"Matthew, Jenna,I'll go get the votes."
1664,01:23:26.57,01:23:30.50,"Guys, I would loveto read these votes right now."

1666,01:23:31.83,01:23:33.17,I know you wantto know the answer.
1667,01:23:33.17,01:23:34.93,"Unfortunately,the reading of the votes"
1668,01:23:34.93,01:23:39.23,will have to wait until we getback to the United States.

1686,01:27:34.97,01:27:38.07,It is time to bring itto a close.
1687,01:27:38.07,01:27:40.10,I think Rob said it best:
1688,01:27:40.10,01:27:41.83,it started as a battleof the sexes;
1689,01:27:41.83,01:27:44.77,it is only fittingthat it end the same way.
1690,01:27:44.77,01:27:48.20,It was a long 39 daysfor you guys.
1691,01:27:48.20,01:27:50.47,"You don't get to the final twowithout doing something right,"
1692,01:27:50.47,01:27:54.23,"but ultimately, only one of youwill be the sole Survivor."
1693,01:27:54.23,01:27:57.07,"Before we get to the votes, Iwant to do something different."
1694,01:27:57.07,01:28:00.17,I want to check in and see
1695,01:28:00.17,01:28:03.97,how confidentyou're both feeling.
1696,01:28:03.97,01:28:06.27,"Matthew, you've had a long timeto think about this."
1697,01:28:06.27,01:28:07.50,You saw how it played out.
1698,01:28:07.50,01:28:09.37,You know what you saidand did out there.
1699,01:28:09.37,01:28:11.97,"Of the seven jury membersthat you spent 39 days with,"

1701,01:28:13.37,01:28:16.63,how many of these guysdo you think voted for you?

1703,01:28:18.27,01:28:21.70,"I feel I've got two votes for,five votes against."
1704,01:28:21.70,01:28:23.73,Not very optimistic.
1705,01:28:23.73,01:28:26.00,CROWD:Aw.

1709,01:28:32.83,01:28:34.83,Rob a wild card?
1710,01:28:34.83,01:28:36.90,Rob is a wild card.
1711,01:28:36.90,01:28:38.23,"Jenna, how about you?"
1712,01:28:38.23,01:28:39.23,"Looking across at these guys,"
1713,01:28:39.23,01:28:40.47,-who do you know you have?-Um...
1714,01:28:40.47,01:28:42.70,"I would hope that Alex and Heidivoted for me,"
1715,01:28:42.70,01:28:46.03,"and I think that, honestly,the rest probably went to Matt."
1716,01:28:46.03,01:28:47.90,Okay. Now we're being humble.
1717,01:28:47.90,01:28:50.20,-All right.-(laughter)

1728,01:29:14.37,01:29:16.03,"Jury, you've already madethe decision."
