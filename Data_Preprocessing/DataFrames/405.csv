29,00:02:45.90,00:02:45.90,I'm definitely almost positivehe's going to be the first to
30,00:02:49.63,00:02:49.63,"go, then it's probably goingto be a tossup between myself"
31,00:02:53.27,00:02:53.27,and V.And they'll probably take me out
32,00:02:55.43,00:02:55.43,"second, because V's a lot betterat... (smooching sound)"
33,00:02:58.53,00:02:58.53,You know what I'm saying?>> It's cool to finally get a

45,00:03:31.33,00:03:31.33,long they're going to be here.These guys brought the game in
46,00:03:34.60,00:03:34.60,with them.They brought the game with them.
47,00:03:36.23,00:03:36.23,It started here in our camp now.>> Ready?
48,00:03:38.53,00:03:38.53,We're off.>> I came here to try to build a
49,00:03:41.90,00:03:41.90,"society with seven strangers,but the switch sort of turned my"
50,00:03:46.13,00:03:46.13,initial experience around.>> Sounds like their game has
51,00:03:49.57,00:03:49.57,"been so different than ours,really interesting."
52,00:03:51.80,00:03:51.80,>> It's like it was cutthroatfrom the beginning in their
53,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,"group, though.>> Especially if you start"
54,00:03:55.93,00:03:55.93,getting the thing where you'reactually lying to people.
55,00:03:58.13,00:03:58.13,">> Yeah, that's weird.>> They were lying from day one."
56,00:04:00.87,00:04:00.87,"I mean, these were like realrelationships."
57,00:04:02.97,00:04:02.97,"Granted, we are in a gameformat..."
58,00:04:04.63,00:04:04.63,">> Not ""like,"" they are realrelationships."

66,00:04:24.03,00:04:24.03,that we had of eight people.I'm here to see if eight people
67,00:04:27.60,00:04:27.60,"from all over the country,from eight different kinds of"
68,00:04:31.70,00:04:31.70,"lives can come here and do this,and live and be happy."
69,00:04:35.60,00:04:35.60,And build something amazing.>> But would you lie to win the
70,00:04:38.60,00:04:38.60,game?>> I'm not here to play the
71,00:04:39.83,00:04:39.83,game.>> But you are playing the game.
72,00:04:41.37,00:04:41.37,"You are here.>> No, that's not what I'm here"

75,00:04:47.80,00:04:47.80,"this game, you're not hereon a commune."
76,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,"You know, this is not the'60s, and free love and all that"
77,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,"kind of stuff.>> Once the swap happened, it"
78,00:05:02.30,00:05:02.30,"really should have been game onfor everybody, but I could just"
79,00:05:05.63,00:05:05.63,"sense that something wasn't, youknow, right."
80,00:05:07.53,00:05:07.53,"So I'm like, ""Okay fine, I'lljust, you know, watch him"
81,00:05:10.80,00:05:10.80,"carefully, watch who he'stalking to, and then I'll deal"
82,00:05:14.30,00:05:14.30,"with him accordingly.>> Heavenly Father, we're very"
83,00:05:29.63,00:05:29.63,"grateful for this wonderful daythat we have ahead of us, and we"
84,00:05:32.80,00:05:32.80,ask Thee if Thou would pleasehelp us find all the things we

86,00:05:38.90,00:05:38.90,">> The vibe, the morning afterSarah left, was actually very"
87,00:05:43.03,00:05:43.03,good.>> All right.
88,00:05:44.43,00:05:44.43,"Okay, guys.>> I think they wanted her out"
89,00:05:46.83,00:05:46.83,just as much as I did.I think we all just bonded.
90,00:05:49.23,00:05:49.23,We knew our team was pretty muchcomplete at that point.
91,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,>> This is so nice to be overhere.
92,00:05:54.53,00:05:54.53,It's like so peaceful today.>> It reminds me of living in
93,00:05:58.03,00:05:58.03,"Atlanta, which I did most of mylife, and living in a little old"
94,00:06:01.73,00:06:01.73,"country town, which I do rightnow."
95,00:06:03.73,00:06:03.73,">> I think the point is that allfour of us, are, like, we just"
96,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87,all have this energy about us.We just have this spirit that we
97,00:06:09.93,00:06:09.93,just all want to win.>> I have a feeling that we're
98,00:06:12.70,00:06:12.70,"going to win our nextchallenges, too."
99,00:06:14.87,00:06:14.87,">> I keep hearing crabs over inthe corner, what I thought were"
100,00:06:18.80,00:06:18.80,crabs in the back.The only thing I can think is
101,00:06:21.03,00:06:21.03,that they're eating our basket.>> Kathy and Paschal wanted to
102,00:06:23.67,00:06:23.67,"go get crab, and then Neleh andI are like, ""No, we'll all go."
103,00:06:26.67,00:06:26.67,"Let's go as a group.""I think that was really the"
104,00:06:29.53,00:06:29.53,first thing that we had done asa tribe that meant something.
105,00:06:34.27,00:06:34.27,>> So before you know it we wereunder these acacia trees and all
106,00:06:38.47,00:06:38.47,"of a sudden, these dudes, theseandroids were just going back"
107,00:06:41.97,00:06:41.97,and forth...And they were so easy to catch.
108,00:06:50.77,00:06:50.77,>> I've got three here.>> I've got two here.
109,00:06:52.10,00:06:52.10,">> It's really hilarious to seethem, because they're all"
110,00:06:53.77,00:06:53.77,screwing around thinking they'rehiding.
111,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,>> Yow!He got me.
112,00:07:02.07,00:07:02.07,"Whoa!>> Oh, look, here's one right"
113,00:07:04.47,00:07:04.47,"here, too.>> Oh, my God, look at the size"
114,00:07:06.53,00:07:06.53,of this puppy.>> We pocketed probably about
115,00:07:09.57,00:07:09.57,12 crab.Good job.
116,00:07:11.03,00:07:11.03,>> The crabs then came back tocamp.
117,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,>> Oh! Oh!So we put them in one big pot of
118,00:07:18.50,00:07:18.50,"salt water and started boilingthem until they change color,"
119,00:07:23.13,00:07:23.13,"and, unfortunately, it does takea lot to get the meat out..."
120,00:07:29.97,00:07:29.97,but the reward is so huge.Because it's fresh plumpy crab
121,00:07:35.13,00:07:35.13,"meat.So we were just picking away,"
122,00:07:36.87,00:07:36.87,and every little thing went inthat was edible.
123,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20,Then we just ate the biggestspoonfuls.
124,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,We weren't dainty at all.>> You couldn't ask for
125,00:07:50.73,00:07:50.73,anything better.>> Maybe little crackers.
126,00:07:53.33,00:07:53.33,">> Boy, that's delicious.>> If that isn't a morale"
127,00:07:57.07,00:07:57.07,"booster, I didn't know what is.>> Whoo-wee."
128,00:07:59.57,00:07:59.57,">> I think we all have thespirit, and it's here, this is"

394,00:22:17.10,00:22:17.10,"Right now, I've got Rob, Zoe,Tammy and myself."
395,00:22:20.80,00:22:20.80,The only thing I have to reallyworry about is if we lose
396,00:22:22.97,00:22:22.97,"tomorrow's immunity challenge,because if that happens, I could"

408,00:23:13.47,00:23:13.47,we've got to make our camp ascolorful and creative as

412,00:23:25.20,00:23:25.20,and down.>> We can do a red sheet and
413,00:23:26.90,00:23:26.90,then we got black ash and putS.O.S. on the red sheets.
414,00:23:30.83,00:23:30.83,We started brainstorming.Came up with the idea of using
415,00:23:33.90,00:23:33.90,our blankets that we had gottenthe day before.
416,00:23:36.47,00:23:36.47,>> Plus we have four pillows.>> Use the old pot of theirs.

422,00:23:51.40,00:23:51.40,standing up.>> What do you think about using

424,00:24:00.80,00:24:00.80,>> We can win this one.>> Yep.
425,00:24:03.07,00:24:03.07,">> I want to win this immunityfor two reasons, one of those is"
426,00:24:07.37,00:24:07.37,because we don't have to go toTribal Council if we win.
427,00:24:09.77,00:24:09.77,But the other reason is so thatwe can send the other team to
428,00:24:12.80,00:24:12.80,Tribal Council.One of my hopes is that one of
429,00:24:15.30,00:24:15.30,the three members of the oldMaraamu will get voted off
430,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,"tomorrow night.>> Good-bye, Sean."

445,00:25:02.80,00:25:02.80,Maraamu might have won twochallenges in a row by winning
446,00:25:05.73,00:25:05.73,the one yesterday and raidingour camp.
447,00:25:07.63,00:25:07.63,Because a lot of the materialsthat we would have used in our

449,00:25:14.50,00:25:14.50,the white blankets.>> They have the blankets and

492,00:27:46.27,00:27:46.27,Sean could create a foursome.That would put me at a
493,00:27:49.73,00:27:49.73,disadvantage.I needed at least one of the

495,00:27:54.67,00:27:54.67,case Gabe figured out that I wastrying to vote him out.
496,00:27:57.30,00:27:57.30,"Sean, take a walk with me.So then I went to Sean because I"
497,00:28:05.63,00:28:05.63,wanted to get him to voteagainst Gabe.
498,00:28:08.80,00:28:08.80,"And that's no bull.I mean, I told you straight up"
499,00:28:11.10,00:28:11.10,"when you first came to thiscamp, that I would always be"
500,00:28:13.83,00:28:13.83,honest with you.That I was never going to lie in

513,00:28:45.97,00:28:45.97,"going to get rid of Gabe, whichis surprising."
514,00:28:49.17,00:28:49.17,I think it was a mistake thatJohn told me that.
515,00:28:51.93,00:28:51.93,"If they're going to vote forGabriel, they needed to just do"
516,00:28:53.90,00:28:53.90,it and let me just sit there andthink that I was going to be

595,00:34:13.53,00:34:13.53,figure out a way to spin it.I thought Gabe would have been a
596,00:34:16.53,00:34:16.53,good way if we could get him.If we can trust him.
597,00:34:19.53,00:34:19.53,"If we could, then we'd have theadvantage over here."

608,00:34:56.60,00:34:56.60,My only question I have for youis if you were 100% set in the

613,00:35:18.33,00:35:18.33,A way to shake things up.Just do me a favor and don't
614,00:35:21.60,00:35:21.60,tell anybody what we talkedabout right now.

622,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,maybe try to hatch somethingelse.
623,00:35:50.93,00:35:50.93,"I'm a little bit nervous, isthis plan going to work?"
624,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,"And if it does, it's awesome.I'm sitting in a really great"

646,00:37:25.53,00:37:25.53,But we had a good roll and we'restill optimistic that we're
