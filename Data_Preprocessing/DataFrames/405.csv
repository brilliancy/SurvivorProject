1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.03,00:00:02.03, Survivor... The tribes were switched up
3,00:00:03.57,00:00:03.57,"at random, making it a brand-new game for everyone."
4,00:00:05.27,00:00:05.27,"Number of tribe members in each tribe hasn't changed, just the"
5,00:00:08.27,00:00:08.27,"members within the tribe. While Paschal, Neleh and Kathy"
6,00:00:11.43,00:00:11.43,discovered Maraamu's beautiful beach...
7,00:00:13.93,00:00:13.93,>> I feel like we're at a four-star hotel.
8,00:00:15.93,00:00:15.93,>> To our new little family. >> PROBST: ...Rob Mariano and
9,00:00:18.60,00:00:18.60,Sean didn't like their new Rotu environment.
10,00:00:20.50,00:00:20.50,>> Life over here is about two degrees shy of hell.
11,00:00:23.70,00:00:23.70,>> We're not going to walk around here like slaves to prove
12,00:00:26.40,00:00:26.40,anything to anybody. >> PROBST: And Vecepia avoided
13,00:00:29.03,00:00:29.03,"all conflict. >> As far as the drama, bump"
14,00:00:31.40,00:00:31.40,that. I ain't with it.
15,00:00:32.63,00:00:32.63,>> PROBST: New faces couldn't break Maraamu's losing streak.
16,00:00:35.70,00:00:35.70,Rotu! >> Yes!
17,00:00:37.77,00:00:37.77,">> PROBST: At their fourth consecutive Tribal Council,"
18,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00,Sarah was voted off the island. The tribe has spoken.
19,00:00:44.77,00:00:44.77,12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
20,00:02:16.63,00:02:16.63,">> Three days ago, we switched tribes."
21,00:02:20.37,00:02:20.37,And now I'm over here at the Rotu tribe.
22,00:02:23.37,00:02:23.37,"Kind of gross, huh? I'm not really too happy about"
23,00:02:27.67,00:02:27.67,it. I had pretty much everything
24,00:02:29.73,00:02:29.73,"under control at Maraamu. Over here, we're five against"
25,00:02:33.43,00:02:33.43,three. And we're in the minority.
26,00:02:35.70,00:02:35.70,>> Like it? >> Nectar of the gods.
27,00:02:38.00,00:02:38.00,I love it. >> Sean definitely is done with
28,00:02:41.90,00:02:41.90,"the game. He's just laying around, he"
29,00:02:43.90,00:02:43.90,doesn't want to try to fit in at all.
30,00:02:45.90,00:02:45.90,I'm definitely almost positive he's going to be the first to
31,00:02:49.63,00:02:49.63,"go, then it's probably going to be a tossup between myself"
32,00:02:53.27,00:02:53.27,and V. And they'll probably take me out
33,00:02:55.43,00:02:55.43,"second, because V's a lot better at... (smooching sound)"
34,00:02:58.53,00:02:58.53,You know what I'm saying? >> It's cool to finally get a
35,00:03:02.43,00:03:02.43,"chance to talk with all of you, get to know you all."
36,00:03:05.10,00:03:05.10,">> Myself, I wanted to try to get in with their tribe, make"
37,00:03:08.60,00:03:08.60,some kind of agreement or an alliance.
38,00:03:10.87,00:03:10.87,You consider us Rotu more than you consider the other people
39,00:03:14.10,00:03:14.10,"that were originally on Rotu? >> As far as I'm concerned, you"
40,00:03:17.17,00:03:17.17,"guys are Rotu. Right now, that's what we deal"
41,00:03:19.30,00:03:19.30,"with. >> I couldn't tell you that,"
42,00:03:21.10,00:03:21.10,"honestly, you know, you're more Rotu than them, or them more"
43,00:03:24.37,00:03:24.37,"than you. Right now, you're here."
44,00:03:26.07,00:03:26.07,"You're Rotu, man. >> That's the way I feel, for"
45,00:03:29.57,00:03:29.57,sure. >> People are worried about how
46,00:03:31.33,00:03:31.33,long they're going to be here. These guys brought the game in
47,00:03:34.60,00:03:34.60,with them. They brought the game with them.
48,00:03:36.23,00:03:36.23,It started here in our camp now. >> Ready?
49,00:03:38.53,00:03:38.53,We're off. >> I came here to try to build a
50,00:03:41.90,00:03:41.90,"society with seven strangers, but the switch sort of turned my"
51,00:03:46.13,00:03:46.13,initial experience around. >> Sounds like their game has
52,00:03:49.57,00:03:49.57,"been so different than ours, really interesting."
53,00:03:51.80,00:03:51.80,>> It's like it was cutthroat from the beginning in their
54,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,"group, though. >> Especially if you start"
55,00:03:55.93,00:03:55.93,getting the thing where you're actually lying to people.
56,00:03:58.13,00:03:58.13,">> Yeah, that's weird. >> They were lying from day one."
57,00:04:00.87,00:04:00.87,"I mean, these were like real relationships."
58,00:04:02.97,00:04:02.97,"Granted, we are in a game format..."
59,00:04:04.63,00:04:04.63,">> Not ""like,"" they are real relationships."
60,00:04:06.70,00:04:06.70,">> Be honest, stick to your, you know, stick to your ethics,"
61,00:04:10.00,00:04:10.00,and... >> What are the ethics in this
62,00:04:12.40,00:04:12.40,"game? >> To me, it's tell the truth."
63,00:04:15.20,00:04:15.20,Be honest. >> Maybe.
64,00:04:17.87,00:04:17.87,>> Are you saying that you would lie to win this game?
65,00:04:19.60,00:04:19.60,">> Oh, I'm not even here to play the game, man."
66,00:04:21.60,00:04:21.60,I'm here for what we had. I'm here for that society
67,00:04:24.03,00:04:24.03,that we had of eight people. I'm here to see if eight people
68,00:04:27.60,00:04:27.60,"from all over the country, from eight different kinds of"
69,00:04:31.70,00:04:31.70,"lives can come here and do this, and live and be happy."
70,00:04:35.60,00:04:35.60,And build something amazing. >> But would you lie to win the
71,00:04:38.60,00:04:38.60,game? >> I'm not here to play the
72,00:04:39.83,00:04:39.83,game. >> But you are playing the game.
73,00:04:41.37,00:04:41.37,"You are here. >> No, that's not what I'm here"
74,00:04:43.20,00:04:43.20,for. >> Gabriel says he's not playing
75,00:04:45.40,00:04:45.40,"the game. I mean, you are here to play"
76,00:04:47.80,00:04:47.80,"this game, you're not here on a commune."
77,00:04:50.33,00:04:50.33,"You know, this is not the '60s, and free love and all that"
78,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,"kind of stuff. >> Once the swap happened, it"
79,00:05:02.30,00:05:02.30,"really should have been game on for everybody, but I could just"
80,00:05:05.63,00:05:05.63,"sense that something wasn't, you know, right."
81,00:05:07.53,00:05:07.53,"So I'm like, ""Okay fine, I'll just, you know, watch him"
82,00:05:10.80,00:05:10.80,"carefully, watch who he's talking to, and then I'll deal"
83,00:05:14.30,00:05:14.30,"with him accordingly. >> Heavenly Father, we're very"
84,00:05:29.63,00:05:29.63,"grateful for this wonderful day that we have ahead of us, and we"
85,00:05:32.80,00:05:32.80,ask Thee if Thou would please help us find all the things we
86,00:05:36.03,00:05:36.03,"need today, that we may be able to work hard together as a team."
87,00:05:38.90,00:05:38.90,">> The vibe, the morning after Sarah left, was actually very"
88,00:05:43.03,00:05:43.03,good. >> All right.
89,00:05:44.43,00:05:44.43,"Okay, guys. >> I think they wanted her out"
90,00:05:46.83,00:05:46.83,just as much as I did. I think we all just bonded.
91,00:05:49.23,00:05:49.23,We knew our team was pretty much complete at that point.
92,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,>> This is so nice to be over here.
93,00:05:54.53,00:05:54.53,It's like so peaceful today. >> It reminds me of living in
94,00:05:58.03,00:05:58.03,"Atlanta, which I did most of my life, and living in a little old"
95,00:06:01.73,00:06:01.73,"country town, which I do right now."
96,00:06:03.73,00:06:03.73,">> I think the point is that all four of us, are, like, we just"
97,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87,all have this energy about us. We just have this spirit that we
98,00:06:09.93,00:06:09.93,just all want to win. >> I have a feeling that we're
99,00:06:12.70,00:06:12.70,"going to win our next challenges, too."
100,00:06:14.87,00:06:14.87,">> I keep hearing crabs over in the corner, what I thought were"
101,00:06:18.80,00:06:18.80,crabs in the back. The only thing I can think is
102,00:06:21.03,00:06:21.03,that they're eating our basket. >> Kathy and Paschal wanted to
103,00:06:23.67,00:06:23.67,"go get crab, and then Neleh and I are like, ""No, we'll all go."
104,00:06:26.67,00:06:26.67,"Let's go as a group."" I think that was really the"
105,00:06:29.53,00:06:29.53,first thing that we had done as a tribe that meant something.
106,00:06:34.27,00:06:34.27,>> So before you know it we were under these acacia trees and all
107,00:06:38.47,00:06:38.47,"of a sudden, these dudes, these androids were just going back"
108,00:06:41.97,00:06:41.97,and forth... And they were so easy to catch.
109,00:06:50.77,00:06:50.77,>> I've got three here. >> I've got two here.
110,00:06:52.10,00:06:52.10,">> It's really hilarious to see them, because they're all"
111,00:06:53.77,00:06:53.77,screwing around thinking they're hiding.
112,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,>> Yow! He got me.
113,00:07:02.07,00:07:02.07,"Whoa! >> Oh, look, here's one right"
114,00:07:04.47,00:07:04.47,"here, too. >> Oh, my God, look at the size"
115,00:07:06.53,00:07:06.53,of this puppy. >> We pocketed probably about
116,00:07:09.57,00:07:09.57,12 crab. Good job.
117,00:07:11.03,00:07:11.03,>> The crabs then came back to camp.
118,00:07:14.33,00:07:14.33,>> Oh! Oh! So we put them in one big pot of
119,00:07:18.50,00:07:18.50,"salt water and started boiling them until they change color,"
120,00:07:23.13,00:07:23.13,"and, unfortunately, it does take a lot to get the meat out..."
121,00:07:29.97,00:07:29.97,but the reward is so huge. Because it's fresh plumpy crab
122,00:07:35.13,00:07:35.13,"meat. So we were just picking away,"
123,00:07:36.87,00:07:36.87,and every little thing went in that was edible.
124,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20,Then we just ate the biggest spoonfuls.
125,00:07:47.33,00:07:47.33,We weren't dainty at all. >> You couldn't ask for
126,00:07:50.73,00:07:50.73,anything better. >> Maybe little crackers.
127,00:07:53.33,00:07:53.33,">> Boy, that's delicious. >> If that isn't a morale"
128,00:07:57.07,00:07:57.07,"booster, I didn't know what is. >> Whoo-wee."
129,00:07:59.57,00:07:59.57,">> I think we all have the spirit, and it's here, this is"
130,00:08:02.90,00:08:02.90,"our time now. >> We're going to win today,"
131,00:08:05.33,00:08:05.33,"that's a promise. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
132,00:08:17.57,00:08:17.57,"Maraamu, lost another member at the last Tribal Council."
133,00:08:20.73,00:08:20.73,Sarah is out of the game. They're now down to four.
134,00:08:23.27,00:08:23.27,Rotu still a full tribe at eight.
135,00:08:25.13,00:08:25.13,"Today's reward challenge requires teamwork, but most"
136,00:08:28.80,00:08:28.80,"importantly, trust. When the challenge begins, four"
137,00:08:31.87,00:08:31.87,tikis for each tribe will have been deconstructed and the 14
138,00:08:35.13,00:08:35.13,pieces separated and scattered out into the surrounding area.
139,00:08:38.67,00:08:38.67,Four members of each tribe will participate.
140,00:08:40.93,00:08:40.93,Three will be blindfolded. One person will be your set of
141,00:08:44.10,00:08:44.10,eyes. This caller will direct the
142,00:08:45.77,00:08:45.77,blindfolded members to the various pieces scattered in the
143,00:08:48.70,00:08:48.70,field. First tribe to get all 14 pieces
144,00:08:51.03,00:08:51.03,back may remove their blindfolds and then begin constructing
145,00:08:54.77,00:08:54.77,their tikis. First tribe to get their tikis
146,00:08:57.63,00:08:57.63,constructed properly wins reward.
147,00:09:00.10,00:09:00.10,And this reward is a big one. The winning tribe gets to visit
148,00:09:04.23,00:09:04.23,the losing tribe's beach and then gets to basically raid the
149,00:09:08.77,00:09:08.77,"camp. >> Oh, my gosh!"
150,00:09:11.97,00:09:11.97,">> PROBST: So for Maraamu, a chance to get in this game."
151,00:09:15.77,00:09:15.77,"For Rotu, potentially a chance to put the nail in the coffin of"
152,00:09:19.43,00:09:19.43,Maraamu. A very big reward.
153,00:09:21.27,00:09:21.27,>> Wow. >> PROBST: Rotu because you have
154,00:09:22.77,00:09:22.77,"eight, you have to sit four out, keeping in mind you cannot sit"
155,00:09:24.73,00:09:24.73,the same people out in back-to- back challenges.
156,00:09:26.50,00:09:26.50,"Who's sitting out? All right, V, Sean, Rob and Zoe,"
157,00:09:29.60,00:09:29.60,you four will hang back with me. You guys will get blindfolded.
158,00:09:33.37,00:09:33.37,"Let's do this, begin. >> Let's go, guys."
159,00:09:35.63,00:09:35.63,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: Okay.
160,00:09:41.43,00:09:41.43,">> This is going to be fun, you guys, just remember that."
161,00:09:43.73,00:09:43.73,">> Yeah, this is fun. >> PROBST: Survivors ready!"
162,00:09:47.00,00:09:47.00,"Go! >> John, move to your 2:00."
163,00:09:49.30,00:09:49.30,">> John, keep going straight. >> Gabe."
164,00:09:50.77,00:09:50.77,">> All right, John, move a little to your left."
165,00:09:52.60,00:09:52.60,"Move to your left. Straight, straight, John."
166,00:09:54.67,00:09:54.67,"Okay, turn left, John! Turn left, John."
167,00:09:56.47,00:09:56.47,"Keep going, keep going. >> Gabe."
168,00:09:58.40,00:09:58.40,">> All right, John, right in front of you on the ground to"
169,00:09:59.97,00:09:59.97,"your right. On your right, John on the"
170,00:10:01.57,00:10:01.57,"ground. That's you, that's you right"
171,00:10:02.80,00:10:02.80,there. All right.
172,00:10:03.77,00:10:03.77,">> Gina in front of you, down, barely left."
173,00:10:06.37,00:10:06.37,"That's it, you got it. Stop, Paschal, take a right"
174,00:10:09.80,00:10:09.80,"Paschal, no, left! Left, Paschal, you got it, left,"
175,00:10:13.50,00:10:13.50,"left! I want you to keep going, keep"
176,00:10:15.53,00:10:15.53,"going. Okay, you're on it!"
177,00:10:17.07,00:10:17.07,You're standing on it! That's great.
178,00:10:19.30,00:10:19.30,">> Okay, Tammy, stop. Tammy, stop."
179,00:10:20.63,00:10:20.63,Right on your left there's a basket on the ground.
180,00:10:22.63,00:10:22.63,"A little to your left, Tammy. A little to your left."
181,00:10:24.67,00:10:24.67,"Tammy, to your right. Tammy, to your right."
182,00:10:26.37,00:10:26.37,"That's it. All right, straight ahead, John."
183,00:10:28.57,00:10:28.57,"Now stop. >> Go to your left, right there,"
184,00:10:30.80,00:10:30.80,"go left. Okay, you're here."
185,00:10:32.77,00:10:32.77,">> Keep going, keep going. Okay, Tammy right towards me."
186,00:10:34.93,00:10:34.93,Hear my voice? Hear my voice?
187,00:10:36.33,00:10:36.33,"That's it. Stop, stop, stop."

210,00:11:25.17,00:11:25.17,"Paschal, go straight. Whoops."
211,00:11:27.40,00:11:27.40,">> Which way, come on?. >> Straight, ten feet."
212,00:11:29.77,00:11:29.77,">> Paschal, little bit to your right, a little to your left."
213,00:11:32.93,00:11:32.93,"Okay, stop Paschal, to your right, in the basket, that's it,"
214,00:11:36.93,00:11:36.93,"you got it. >> John, right behind you."
215,00:11:39.03,00:11:39.03,There's some oars. The other side of the oars.
216,00:11:41.33,00:11:41.33,"That's it. It's the last one, John."
217,00:11:43.10,00:11:43.10,"Follow my voice. >> Through the bushes, keep"

223,00:11:56.00,00:11:56.00,"Can they take them off? >> PROBST: No, Rotu, you got 13."
224,00:11:58.87,00:11:58.87,"You're still missing one. >> Go down, that's it."
225,00:12:01.87,00:12:01.87,"Okay, you can run. >> Where's the last one?"

229,00:12:11.13,00:12:11.13,"Take them off. >> PROBST: Maraamu, take them"

233,00:12:26.33,00:12:26.33,"John, straight ahead. A little to your right."
234,00:12:28.53,00:12:28.53,"A little to your right. No, no, left."
235,00:12:30.20,00:12:30.20,">> Come on, gang, let's go. Straight ahead!"
236,00:12:34.40,00:12:34.40,"Right on your right, on the ground, right there on the"

243,00:12:49.80,00:12:49.80,">> Come on, you guys, help. That's right, that's right."
244,00:12:53.27,00:12:53.27,"Okay, keep going. Yes."
245,00:12:54.67,00:12:54.67,"Okay, okay. But where's this guy?"
246,00:12:57.23,00:12:57.23,">> Don't match. Yeah, these match."
247,00:12:59.30,00:12:59.30,"We're fine. >> Yes, where's this one go?"
248,00:13:01.17,00:13:01.17,>> This goes on top of this one. >> Yellow on the top.
249,00:13:03.70,00:13:03.70,"Hurry! Oh, my God."
250,00:13:04.77,00:13:04.77,"Oh, my God! >> PROBST: Maraamu wins!"
251,00:13:07.67,00:13:07.67,(screaming) We won!
252,00:13:17.13,00:13:17.13,">> PROBST: All right, guys, we're heading over to Rotu's"
253,00:13:19.27,00:13:19.27,"camp. Maraamu, prepare to raid."
254,00:13:21.47,00:13:21.47,"(cheering) >> PROBST: Let's go, guys, this"
255,00:13:51.47,00:13:51.47,"way. Okay, guys, come on in."
256,00:13:56.27,00:13:56.27,"Gina, this is Rotu's home. Kathy, Paschal, Neleh, welcome"
257,00:14:00.73,00:14:00.73,"back to your old camp. All right, keep this in mind"
258,00:14:04.33,00:14:04.33,during the raid. These are the items you cannot
259,00:14:07.23,00:14:07.23,"take, these are the items you must leave."
260,00:14:09.23,00:14:09.23,"One knife, one cooking pot, one water container, the magnifying"
261,00:14:16.00,00:14:16.00,glass. You cannot take any personal
262,00:14:18.27,00:14:18.27,items. Everything else is fair game.
263,00:14:20.90,00:14:20.90,You guys have two minutes and it begins right now.
264,00:14:22.93,00:14:22.93,Go. >> What about their lanterns?
265,00:14:34.53,00:14:34.53,>> Lanterns? >> PROBST: One minute 15 to go.
266,00:14:48.67,00:14:48.67,>> PROBST: 45 seconds. >> Where's their knives?
267,00:15:04.53,00:15:04.53,>> 20 seconds left. 10 seconds.
268,00:15:16.03,00:15:16.03,"Five, four, three, two, one. Raid is over."
269,00:15:26.63,00:15:26.63,">> We did this as a team, okay? >> PROBST: All right, Maraamu,"
270,00:15:37.07,00:15:37.07,"start gathering your stuff. Your boat is waiting, head back"
271,00:15:40.07,00:15:40.07,to camp. >> We got the peppers.
272,00:15:44.47,00:15:44.47,The peppers are in there. Here you go.
273,00:15:47.03,00:15:47.03,>> Let me put that in there. >> Why are we taking a coconut?
274,00:15:50.70,00:15:50.70,">> We can take, like, two trips if we have to."
275,00:15:53.07,00:15:53.07,">> Good-bye, pirates. >> They just called us pirates."
276,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,>> Forgot this! >> We should have taken the
277,00:16:03.80,00:16:03.80,frying pan. >> Everything that we had worked
278,00:16:20.47,00:16:20.47,"for this whole time, everything that we won was just, like, the"
279,00:16:24.00,00:16:24.00,rug was pulled out from under our feet.
280,00:16:26.30,00:16:26.30,">> You guys, let's kind of split up and go get everything we need"
281,00:16:29.63,00:16:29.63,for dinner. >> A lot of times when you face
282,00:16:32.17,00:16:32.17,"adversity and you feel that you're at your weakest point,"
283,00:16:35.73,00:16:35.73,the best thing you can do is bond together and strengthen as
284,00:16:39.93,00:16:39.93,a unit. >> I will start peeling taro if
285,00:16:42.30,00:16:42.30,somebody else wants to start chopping coconut.
286,00:16:45.00,00:16:45.00,>> I was going to do that after he finishes up.
287,00:16:47.43,00:16:47.43,"I felt that this was a perfect opportunity for all of us, you"
288,00:16:51.03,00:16:51.03,"know, because we were still in some sense still a little"
289,00:16:54.23,00:16:54.23,"divided, still with the three and the five."
290,00:16:56.83,00:16:56.83,That this would be the opportunity for us to really
291,00:17:00.20,00:17:00.20,mesh. >> Nice.
292,00:17:01.50,00:17:01.50,"We'll cook it. That's the tiniest bird, boy."
293,00:17:05.00,00:17:05.00,Boy. >> Woo!
294,00:17:21.00,00:17:21.00,>> We had a great time just bringing everything on shore.
295,00:17:25.07,00:17:25.07,">> Oh, my God, that is so much fun!"
296,00:17:27.37,00:17:27.37,I even like seeing that sitting there.
297,00:17:29.97,00:17:29.97,">> We are relishing every little item we took from Rotu, but,"
298,00:17:33.23,00:17:33.23,"most of all, we were happy to put a dent in the big tribe."
299,00:17:36.97,00:17:36.97,"And we were happy that they lost, so they could experience a"
300,00:17:40.43,00:17:40.43,loss. Woo!
301,00:17:45.67,00:17:45.67,>> It's an amazing feeling to have this victory.
302,00:17:48.30,00:17:48.30,"I mean, more than anything I wanted to win so bad, especially"
303,00:17:50.83,00:17:50.83,"for Gina, because she doesn't know what it feels like to win."
304,00:17:53.80,00:17:53.80,>> This is the first time I have ever won here and it's day 13.
305,00:17:57.63,00:17:57.63,">> And that is not easy. >> We have blankets, we got"
306,00:18:00.67,00:18:00.67,pillows. We got a knife.
307,00:18:02.10,00:18:02.10,"We got lanterns. We got their water jugs, we got"
308,00:18:05.03,00:18:05.03,their cutting board with their name on it and we got all their
309,00:18:09.13,00:18:09.13,hot peppers. Words cannot explain how I
310,00:18:11.60,00:18:11.60,felt when we won. I was so happy and so ecstatic.
311,00:18:14.33,00:18:14.33,It was the first time I'd felt as though I'd been on a real
312,00:18:17.63,00:18:17.63,"team. >> You know the old saying, they"
313,00:18:19.30,00:18:19.30,took everything but the kitchen sink?
314,00:18:20.87,00:18:20.87,>> Mm-hmm. >> I think we took the kitchen
315,00:18:22.33,00:18:22.33,sink. >> I think we did.
316,00:18:23.13,00:18:23.13,>> Being the underdog and coming back in a situation like this is
317,00:18:25.37,00:18:25.37,"just, like, huge. It's triumphant."
318,00:18:26.57,00:18:26.57,It's like the best feeling I've had since I've been here.
319,00:18:28.60,00:18:28.60,It beats any one that I had with Rotu.
320,00:18:30.37,00:18:30.37,"God, it's fun to win. >> Mm-hmm."
321,00:18:48.43,00:18:48.43,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Now chillin' on my rap in the South Pacific

336,00:19:32.90,00:19:32.90,starting to bond with the three new members.
337,00:19:35.17,00:19:35.17,"Spending a lot of time together, lots and lots of time together."
338,00:19:39.13,00:19:39.13,(beat-boxing) Gabriel has pretty much said as
339,00:19:43.70,00:19:43.70,much that it's five and three and his plan was to vote them
340,00:19:47.23,00:19:47.23,"all out and to go back to, you know, one big happy family."
341,00:19:54.83,00:19:54.83,">> I'm just going to reconfirm with him saying, you know, are"
342,00:19:57.37,00:19:57.37,you on board and do I have your word that you're going to stick
343,00:20:00.13,00:20:00.13,to this? If he does then I'm fine.
344,00:20:01.67,00:20:01.67,"Two days ago, you said you were going to vote them off one by"
345,00:20:04.87,00:20:04.87,"one. >> No, no, what I said was, I'm"
346,00:20:07.20,00:20:07.20,not here for anything that I can't show to everybody.
347,00:20:10.77,00:20:10.77,I'm not here to do or say anything...
348,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,>> So your goal isn't to put the eight back together then?
349,00:20:14.83,00:20:14.83,I'm going to deal with voting people off when we have to vote
350,00:20:16.53,00:20:16.53,people off. I'm not going to say no matter
351,00:20:18.70,00:20:18.70,what I'm only going to vote for these three people.
352,00:20:21.80,00:20:21.80,">> I don't care what you say to me, I mean, you're going to play"
353,00:20:24.80,00:20:24.80,"your own game. >> No, I'm not!"
354,00:20:26.53,00:20:26.53,">> You are. >> No, I'm not."
355,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47,">> But I think you are. To me at that point, when he"
356,00:20:30.60,00:20:30.60,"said that, I'm like, ""You know what, you're done."
357,00:20:32.80,00:20:32.80,"You're not safe any more."" >> Anybody that I'm going to"
358,00:20:35.30,00:20:35.30,"vote for in this tribe, on this tribe or on a new tribe or the"
359,00:20:38.47,00:20:38.47,"old tribe, I will tell you before it happens."
360,00:20:41.00,00:20:41.00,>> So we just want to make sure...
361,00:20:42.40,00:20:42.40,>> It just got misconstrued. That's all.
362,00:20:44.07,00:20:44.07,">> Okay, are we staying tight? Is that the deal?"
363,00:20:45.90,00:20:45.90,Are we trying to put Rotu back together?
364,00:20:47.43,00:20:47.43,>> John pushed Gabe a little bit too far.
365,00:20:49.43,00:20:49.43,"He hammered him on it. He pushed, and he's still got a"
366,00:20:52.33,00:20:52.33,"chip on his shoulder about it. >> Okay, it's all good."
367,00:20:55.60,00:20:55.60,"Come here, guys. >> Thanks, Tammy."
368,00:21:01.10,00:21:01.10,">> Yeah. >> At that point, I realized I"
369,00:21:05.37,00:21:05.37,had to get rid of Gabe right away.
370,00:21:08.40,00:21:08.40,So I started to devise a plan to be able to do that.
371,00:21:11.83,00:21:11.83,"Basically, I want four people that I know will not vote for"
372,00:21:15.97,00:21:15.97,"me, just plain and simple. I don't have those yet."
373,00:21:19.27,00:21:19.27,"But I mean, I just want, whether you call it alliance, an"
374,00:21:22.37,00:21:22.37,agreement or whatever. >> I have no intention of voting
375,00:21:24.80,00:21:24.80,"you out of here, so don't worry about me."
376,00:21:26.53,00:21:26.53,">> Okay, then I'll give you the same word back."
377,00:21:28.97,00:21:28.97,"I mean, Rob, I'm serious, when I say that, that means that I will"
378,00:21:33.20,00:21:33.20,not write your name down. 100 percent.
379,00:21:37.47,00:21:37.47,"So right now, what we're shooting for, for the final four"
380,00:21:40.23,00:21:40.23,"is yourself, me, Tammy and Rob. Just voting this block."
381,00:21:43.73,00:21:43.73,>> Okay. >> We just hope we have your
382,00:21:45.43,00:21:45.43,"support for that. >> Yeah, of course you do."
383,00:21:47.00,00:21:47.00,">> Because otherwise if we don't, you know, we're screwed."
384,00:21:49.47,00:21:49.47,"We have to vote as a block. Tammy, I'm not playing you."
385,00:21:53.13,00:21:53.13,"Trust me, 100%. I mean, I don't know what else I"
386,00:21:56.20,00:21:56.20,"can say to you. Split my hand open, rub blood on"
387,00:21:58.33,00:21:58.33,you. I have your back.
388,00:22:00.13,00:22:00.13,You are my partner. >> Swear you're not playing me.
389,00:22:04.13,00:22:04.13,">> Tammy, on my mother's ... life."
390,00:22:06.60,00:22:06.60,">> If you're playing me, I swear I'll kick your ass."
391,00:22:08.50,00:22:08.50,>> What else can I tell you? On my mother's life.
392,00:22:10.23,00:22:10.23,">> All right. >> I mean, who is going to stand"
393,00:22:11.90,00:22:11.90,here and say that they're going to swear on their mother's life?
394,00:22:15.13,00:22:15.13,What kind of creep is going to do that?
395,00:22:17.10,00:22:17.10,"Right now, I've got Rob, Zoe, Tammy and myself."
396,00:22:20.80,00:22:20.80,The only thing I have to really worry about is if we lose
397,00:22:22.97,00:22:22.97,"tomorrow's immunity challenge, because if that happens, I could"
398,00:22:25.97,00:22:25.97,"be out. Gabe is a wild card right now,"
399,00:22:28.50,00:22:28.50,and he could turn the tables on me.
400,00:22:43.20,00:22:43.20,">> Ooh, it's so simple. ""Ships passing in the distance"
401,00:22:50.73,00:22:50.73,"when you're struggling to survive, to get that ship's"
402,00:22:53.87,00:22:53.87,"attention might just keep your tribe alive."""
403,00:22:56.63,00:22:56.63,">> ""Build any signal possible, except no fire can you blaze, if"
404,00:23:01.30,00:23:01.30,"you hear the ship's horn sound. >> ""You just bought three more"
405,00:23:05.37,00:23:05.37,"days."" >> Yes!"
406,00:23:06.10,00:23:06.10,We can do this! >> We got tree mail.
407,00:23:08.47,00:23:08.47,We're really excited. It's going to be some type of
408,00:23:11.37,00:23:11.37,S.O.S. thing. The ship's going to come by and
409,00:23:13.47,00:23:13.47,we've got to make our camp as colorful and creative as
410,00:23:15.60,00:23:15.60,"possible, so we can catch their attention and win immunity."
411,00:23:18.73,00:23:18.73,>> Is a red triangle distress? >> Black.
412,00:23:21.87,00:23:21.87,">> Maybe we could put our sheets together and, like, wave them up"
413,00:23:25.20,00:23:25.20,and down. >> We can do a red sheet and
414,00:23:26.90,00:23:26.90,then we got black ash and put S.O.S. on the red sheets.
415,00:23:30.83,00:23:30.83,We started brainstorming. Came up with the idea of using
416,00:23:33.90,00:23:33.90,our blankets that we had gotten the day before.
417,00:23:36.47,00:23:36.47,>> Plus we have four pillows. >> Use the old pot of theirs.
418,00:23:40.00,00:23:40.00,Win immunity by using their blankets.
419,00:23:42.07,00:23:42.07,">> Oh, we're going to win again! Yeah!"
420,00:23:44.17,00:23:44.17,">> Yeah, we are. >> We're like, thank you, Rotu,"
421,00:23:46.40,00:23:46.40,"you know, thanks for everything. >> So we got to build something"
422,00:23:49.20,00:23:49.20,"to hold the sheets, too. >> It's definitely got to be"
423,00:23:51.40,00:23:51.40,standing up. >> What do you think about using
424,00:23:58.00,00:23:58.00,"a triangle instead of S.O.S. >> Ooh, yeah."
425,00:24:00.80,00:24:00.80,>> We can win this one. >> Yep.
426,00:24:03.07,00:24:03.07,">> I want to win this immunity for two reasons, one of those is"
427,00:24:07.37,00:24:07.37,because we don't have to go to Tribal Council if we win.
428,00:24:09.77,00:24:09.77,But the other reason is so that we can send the other team to
429,00:24:12.80,00:24:12.80,Tribal Council. One of my hopes is that one of
430,00:24:15.30,00:24:15.30,the three members of the old Maraamu will get voted off
431,00:24:18.23,00:24:18.23,"tomorrow night. >> Good-bye, Sean."
432,00:24:20.87,00:24:20.87,">> Good-bye, Rob. Bye-bye! Bye-bye!"
433,00:24:27.50,00:24:27.50,">> Oh, man. >> Can't build a fire, but"
434,00:24:30.90,00:24:30.90,anything else goes. >> Can't build a fire.
435,00:24:32.40,00:24:32.40,>> And the four that helped yesterday can't help at all
436,00:24:34.43,00:24:34.43,today. The four people that are sitting
437,00:24:36.67,00:24:36.67,"out today, which is, myself, John Gabe and Tammy."
438,00:24:39.67,00:24:39.67,"We competed in the reward challenge yesterday, so we're"
439,00:24:42.83,00:24:42.83,not allowed to compete in this challenge today.
440,00:24:45.57,00:24:45.57,">> Okay, one thing we're going to want to use is our magnifying"
441,00:24:48.47,00:24:48.47,glass. >> Did you help yesterday?
442,00:24:50.27,00:24:50.27,">> Oh, we can't talk even. >> You are not involved at all."
443,00:24:53.63,00:24:53.63,">> You know what, we should brainstorm with all the"
444,00:24:56.70,00:24:56.70,"materials that we may use, lay it out, look at it and see what"
445,00:25:00.33,00:25:00.33,"we're going to do. >> The way I look at it is,"
446,00:25:02.80,00:25:02.80,Maraamu might have won two challenges in a row by winning
447,00:25:05.73,00:25:05.73,the one yesterday and raiding our camp.
448,00:25:07.63,00:25:07.63,Because a lot of the materials that we would have used in our
449,00:25:10.80,00:25:10.80,"signal for immunity, would be the stuff they took, especially"
450,00:25:14.50,00:25:14.50,the white blankets. >> They have the blankets and
451,00:25:17.17,00:25:17.17,all that. >> We're just going to worry
452,00:25:19.00,00:25:19.00,"about what we have, we can't worry about what they have."
453,00:25:21.80,00:25:21.80,">> How about this, how about... >> Building a structure or"
454,00:25:25.23,00:25:25.23,something. >> We need to make orange
455,00:25:27.70,00:25:27.70,standing out on a white background.
456,00:25:30.20,00:25:30.20,>> Either white or the black. >> Black.
457,00:25:33.33,00:25:33.33,Stretch it out on this. >> I don't believe that the
458,00:25:36.87,00:25:36.87,people that are making our distress signal are the most
459,00:25:40.03,00:25:40.03,creative that we have in the group.
460,00:25:44.33,00:25:44.33,Our immunity fate is in the hands of the three ex-Maraamu
461,00:25:49.30,00:25:49.30,"people and Zoe. >> One, two, three."
462,00:25:53.43,00:25:53.43,">> I have full confidence in Zoe, you know, she's been a"
463,00:25:56.80,00:25:56.80,seafaring woman her whole life. Rob and Sean have sat out both
464,00:26:00.57,00:26:00.57,"the challenges so far, so this is the first time they're"
465,00:26:03.10,00:26:03.10,actually stepping up to the plate.
466,00:26:04.63,00:26:04.63,"A lot of it is riding on them, you know, to see if they can"
467,00:26:07.80,00:26:07.80,pull out a victory for us. >> Good.
468,00:26:11.67,00:26:11.67,">> Yeah, that's a good design. >> Now, how will we make the"
469,00:26:15.07,00:26:15.07,life preservers stay? >> We could put one in each
470,00:26:17.23,00:26:17.23,"corner. >> Propped up, I think we could"
471,00:26:20.30,00:26:20.30,also use it to stretch out our sign.
472,00:26:36.77,00:26:36.77,>> The importance of this distress signal is that it's an
473,00:26:41.33,00:26:41.33,"immunity challenge at stake, which means if we don't pull it"
474,00:26:44.80,00:26:44.80,"off, one of us is not going to be here."
475,00:26:47.07,00:26:47.07,"If we do pull it off, it also guarantees us three more days."
476,00:26:50.37,00:26:50.37,>> We know this is the challenge that one person is going to be
477,00:26:53.20,00:26:53.20,leaving and it is not going to be Rotu.
478,00:26:54.97,00:26:54.97,"So, Father God, in the name of Jesus, we thank you for the"
479,00:26:57.17,00:26:57.17,"wisdom and knowledge today. We thank you for understanding,"
480,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,Father God. We thank you for the coming of
481,00:27:01.27,00:27:01.27,"the minds, Dear Lord, that we can come up with the best plan"
482,00:27:03.67,00:27:03.67,that we know That we can win this challenge.
483,00:27:13.13,00:27:13.13,>> Even though it looks like Fat Albert and the Cosby kids'
484,00:27:16.63,00:27:16.63,"S.O.S. sign, it's still... I think it's pretty good,"
485,00:27:20.17,00:27:20.17,considering what we have. >> Win one for the Gipper.
486,00:27:23.93,00:27:23.93,>> The Gipper? >>> Yeah.
487,00:27:25.53,00:27:25.53,>> Who's that? >> I don't know.
488,00:27:27.67,00:27:27.67,"Somebody says that. Some big name says that,"
489,00:27:29.60,00:27:29.60,"""Win one for the Gipper."" >> Rotu!"
490,00:27:33.47,00:27:33.47,">> Okay, we have our oars ready. >> We don't have to hoot and"
491,00:27:37.47,00:27:37.47,"holler, but let's get in position and see how we're going"
492,00:27:39.90,00:27:39.90,"to be. >> Gabe, Rob Mariano, V. and"
493,00:27:46.27,00:27:46.27,Sean could create a foursome. That would put me at a
494,00:27:49.73,00:27:49.73,disadvantage. I needed at least one of the
495,00:27:51.87,00:27:51.87,"other new members, so I don't get myself caught in a tie, in"
496,00:27:54.67,00:27:54.67,case Gabe figured out that I was trying to vote him out.
497,00:27:57.30,00:27:57.30,"Sean, take a walk with me. So then I went to Sean because I"
498,00:28:05.63,00:28:05.63,wanted to get him to vote against Gabe.
499,00:28:08.80,00:28:08.80,"And that's no bull. I mean, I told you straight up"
500,00:28:11.10,00:28:11.10,"when you first came to this camp, that I would always be"
501,00:28:13.83,00:28:13.83,honest with you. That I was never going to lie in
502,00:28:16.33,00:28:16.33,"this game, ever. Just, because... it's just this"
503,00:28:19.00,00:28:19.00,gut feeling I have. >> Mm-hmm.
504,00:28:20.53,00:28:20.53,>> I'm going to vote Gabe tomorrow.
505,00:28:22.00,00:28:22.00,>> Mm-hmm. >> But I do want you to know
506,00:28:23.60,00:28:23.60,"that, if we lose this one today, you're not going home."
507,00:28:25.93,00:28:25.93,>> Okay. >> But you have to be tight.
508,00:28:27.63,00:28:27.63,You have to keep your mouth quiet.
509,00:28:29.23,00:28:29.23,"The fact is, we need your strength and that puts your ass,"
510,00:28:32.10,00:28:32.10,"you know, way up there. What I want to do is just get"
511,00:28:34.40,00:28:34.40,everybody to the merge. That's my whole point.
512,00:28:36.23,00:28:36.23,"Just get there, and then we can all just duke it out."
513,00:28:42.63,00:28:42.63,">> As you see the story unfold, the consensus is that they're"
514,00:28:45.97,00:28:45.97,"going to get rid of Gabe, which is surprising."
515,00:28:49.17,00:28:49.17,I think it was a mistake that John told me that.
516,00:28:51.93,00:28:51.93,"If they're going to vote for Gabriel, they needed to just do"
517,00:28:53.90,00:28:53.90,it and let me just sit there and think that I was going to be
518,00:28:56.97,00:28:56.97,"next, or Rob or V. That's their own camp turning on"
519,00:28:59.97,00:28:59.97,"one of their own. It doesn't negate what Rob,"
520,00:29:03.23,00:29:03.23,myself and V. have. Now we have the upper hand.
521,00:29:06.73,00:29:06.73,"All I'm saying is... stay tuned. >> We got one shot at this, so"
522,00:29:13.30,00:29:13.30,"if we got the three of us with Gabe, we got a chance of going"
523,00:29:17.73,00:29:17.73,in four on four. >> The boat.
524,00:29:20.20,00:29:20.20,">> The boat's coming? >> Yeah, that's it, guys."
525,00:29:29.83,00:29:29.83,">> PROBST: We're on board the French vessel, Kaohanui with"
526,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,"Captain Lauren in the South Pacific, just off the coast of"
527,00:29:36.30,00:29:36.30,the Marquesas Islands where our two tribes are living.
528,00:29:39.00,00:29:39.00,"If you were marooned on an island, the one thing you'd want"
529,00:29:42.40,00:29:42.40,to see passing by is a ship like this one.
530,00:29:45.27,00:29:45.27,We've asked both tribes to build a distress signal.
531,00:29:48.13,00:29:48.13,"The tribe whose signal is most clearly visible and, in the"
532,00:29:51.00,00:29:51.00,"expert opinion of Captain Lauren, most likely to attract"
533,00:29:55.83,00:29:55.83,"attention, wins immunity. (screaming)"
534,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,(shouting) Woo-hoo!
535,00:30:12.23,00:30:12.23,">> Keep it going, we'll get their attention!"
536,00:30:15.53,00:30:15.53,"(whistle blowing) >> Come on, boat!"
537,00:30:21.27,00:30:21.27,">> PROBST: All right, Captain, we are at Camp Rotu."
538,00:30:23.43,00:30:23.43,Grab the binoculars and let's take a look.
539,00:30:28.90,00:30:28.90,Would this attract your attention?
540,00:30:31.27,00:30:31.27,">> No, not really. They got plants, trees, it's not"
541,00:30:35.90,00:30:35.90,"very clear, I don't think it's a big attraction."
542,00:30:39.30,00:30:39.30,Maybe after the other I can see if they're better.
543,00:30:43.13,00:30:43.13,">> PROBST: Okay, let's go to Camp Maraamu and we'll let you"
544,00:30:45.57,00:30:45.57,"decide. >> Okay, we go."
545,00:30:46.93,00:30:46.93,">> PROBST: Camp Maraamu, here we come."
546,00:30:48.83,00:30:48.83,">> They're turning around. >> Come on, Rob, wave."
547,00:30:52.23,00:30:52.23,It looks like they're turning. (whistle blowing)
548,00:30:55.93,00:30:55.93,Did you hear anything? >> I didn't hear anything.
549,00:31:08.53,00:31:08.53,">> I've always said, not for a million dollars would I do this."
550,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,>> Yeah! >> I made him wear a hat today
551,00:31:14.57,00:31:14.57,because he looks like a pilgrim boy.
552,00:31:16.30,00:31:16.30,Look at him. >> Hot damn! Paschal!
553,00:31:19.87,00:31:19.87,">> I'm going to kill you, Pixie. >> Run with it, it's cute."
554,00:31:24.13,00:31:24.13,">> This is our ace in the hole right here, the American flag."
555,00:31:26.50,00:31:26.50,"I don't care where you in the world, when you see this, you"
556,00:31:29.60,00:31:29.60,"recognize it. If this can't do it, there is"
557,00:31:32.17,00:31:32.17,"nothing on earth can do it. >> All right, guys, this is it!"
558,00:31:38.53,00:31:38.53,"Better do it. There's the boat, guys!"
559,00:31:42.00,00:31:42.00,"(screaming) >> Keep it straight up and down,"
560,00:31:46.90,00:31:46.90,you guys. >> What?
561,00:31:48.17,00:31:48.17,">> Keep it up and down. >> Tighten it up, Gina."
562,00:31:50.83,00:31:50.83,">> Come on, guys, honk your horn."
563,00:31:54.13,00:31:54.13,">> Keep it going. >> PROBST: All right, Captain"
564,00:31:56.33,00:31:56.33,we're at Camp Maraamu. Grab the binoculars and take a
565,00:31:59.47,00:31:59.47,look. What's your call?
566,00:32:01.97,00:32:01.97,">> Oh, I see a big color red on the sand."
567,00:32:04.77,00:32:04.77,"Red ball, and American flag that attracts me."
568,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,">> PROBST: So the color red? >> Yes, the color red moving,"
569,00:32:11.47,00:32:11.47,"and the flag, too. >> PROBST: Comparing the first"
570,00:32:13.67,00:32:13.67,"distress signal at Camp Rotu to this one, which one would more"
571,00:32:16.43,00:32:16.43,"clearly get your attention? >> Oh, I think this one more"
572,00:32:19.07,00:32:19.07,than the other one. >> PROBST: Very good.
573,00:32:21.00,00:32:21.00,"Okay, Captain Lauren has made his call."
574,00:32:22.83,00:32:22.83,"Camp Maraamu's distress signal is most clearly visible, would"
575,00:32:26.53,00:32:26.53,"attract the attention of a ship. Therefore, Camp Maraamu wins"
576,00:32:30.30,00:32:30.30,"immunity. Hold it steady, I'm going to"
577,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,drop some cargo. >> Help! Help us.
578,00:32:36.40,00:32:36.40,Come on! Honk your horn!
579,00:32:39.40,00:32:39.40,">> Oh, come on, blow your horn. >> I want that horn!"
580,00:32:42.57,00:32:42.57,(horn blares) (screaming)
581,00:32:49.53,00:32:49.53,">> Hey, we tried. We did the best we could."
582,00:33:04.43,00:33:04.43,">> Let's go get it, guys. >> Are you serious?"
583,00:33:07.37,00:33:07.37,">> Oh, my God. >> Let's go get it."
584,00:33:15.50,00:33:15.50,>> All right! >> Who is that under there?
585,00:33:41.20,00:33:41.20,">> Are we feeling better, dude? >> I'm feeling much better."
586,00:33:45.23,00:33:45.23,">> I was just telling Sean that, you know, it's like, if it is a"
587,00:33:48.03,00:33:48.03,"normal merge, then we'll just go in and we take out the other"
588,00:33:50.87,00:33:50.87,"side and we all just stick together, and then the worst"
589,00:33:53.53,00:33:53.53,that any of us can do is seventh place.
590,00:33:55.50,00:33:55.50,"After that, everyone just dukes it out."
591,00:33:57.47,00:33:57.47,">> All right, man. I appreciate it, you know, for"
592,00:33:59.90,00:33:59.90,"including us. >> Well, we're all a tribe."
593,00:34:02.60,00:34:02.60,">> To tell you the truth, I don't believe John for a second."
594,00:34:05.20,00:34:05.20,"I think he's, like, slick, and I have a plan that may work to get"
595,00:34:11.03,00:34:11.03,rid of John. I'm just saying we have to
596,00:34:13.53,00:34:13.53,figure out a way to spin it. I thought Gabe would have been a
597,00:34:16.53,00:34:16.53,good way if we could get him. If we can trust him.
598,00:34:19.53,00:34:19.53,"If we could, then we'd have the advantage over here."
599,00:34:23.80,00:34:23.80,You know? >> If Gabe is willing to align
600,00:34:26.57,00:34:26.57,himself with us we may vote for John.
601,00:34:28.97,00:34:28.97,>> Did we stir the taro lately? >> I'm watching it.
602,00:34:32.10,00:34:32.10,">> If you get rid of the head and we have numbers, then, you"
603,00:34:35.87,00:34:35.87,"know, the rest may fall. I look at how the cards are"
604,00:34:39.23,00:34:39.23,"stacked, it's five on three. Unless there's a shakeup, either"
605,00:34:43.17,00:34:43.17,"myself, V. or Rob are going next."
606,00:34:48.83,00:34:48.83,>> Do you know how you're voting?
607,00:34:51.07,00:34:51.07,">> No, I don't know 100% yet. I guess a lot of it is going to"
608,00:34:54.53,00:34:54.53,be how I felt after I talked to you.
609,00:34:56.60,00:34:56.60,My only question I have for you is if you were 100% set in the
610,00:35:01.43,00:35:01.43,"way you wanted to play the game, and you're happy with it, that"
611,00:35:05.90,00:35:05.90,"it's your time to go, then I have no arguments with that."
612,00:35:09.53,00:35:09.53,"I can't argue with that. If, however, you would consider"
613,00:35:13.73,00:35:13.73,"anything else, then maybe we could talk, definitely a twist."
614,00:35:18.33,00:35:18.33,A way to shake things up. Just do me a favor and don't
615,00:35:21.60,00:35:21.60,tell anybody what we talked about right now.
616,00:35:23.97,00:35:23.97,>> Rob Mariano was explaining that it's probably going to be
617,00:35:27.90,00:35:27.90,me voted out tonight. I knew there was only so far in
618,00:35:31.20,00:35:31.20,"the game I could get doing it my way, and now I got another"
619,00:35:34.80,00:35:34.80,"chance. >> The more zip you put on it,"
620,00:35:37.07,00:35:37.07,the tighter your spiral. >> I wish I had not hatched my
621,00:35:40.37,00:35:40.37,plan so quickly with Rob Mariano and Sean.
622,00:35:46.30,00:35:46.30,"I had this little feeling that said, you know, they're going to"
623,00:35:49.30,00:35:49.30,maybe try to hatch something else.
624,00:35:50.93,00:35:50.93,"I'm a little bit nervous, is this plan going to work?"
625,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,"And if it does, it's awesome. I'm sitting in a really great"
626,00:35:59.07,00:35:59.07,"spot. If it doesn't, I'll be eating"
627,00:36:01.03,00:36:01.03,"some good food tonight. >> So, dude, we have to bring"
628,00:36:04.17,00:36:04.17,everything? >> Yeah.
629,00:36:05.43,00:36:05.43,>> I think of all the votes that probably have occurred anywhere
630,00:36:07.93,00:36:07.93,"in this game up to this point, this one is the most pivotal."
631,00:36:11.63,00:36:11.63,It's huge. I think it will be the biggest
632,00:36:13.90,00:36:13.90,move of the game. I think it will send it into a
633,00:36:16.70,00:36:16.70,"whole different direction. >> PROBST: V. and Sean and Rob,"
634,00:36:40.43,00:36:40.43,"you guys can remain seated. The rest of you guys, there's a"
635,00:36:43.40,00:36:43.40,personalized torch behind you. Go ahead and find your torch and
636,00:36:47.10,00:36:47.10,approach the flame. Go ahead and light it up.
637,00:36:54.07,00:36:54.07,"Put it back in its slot. For a lot of you, it's the first"
638,00:36:59.37,00:36:59.37,"time at Tribal Council, and for this tribe a pretty interesting"
639,00:37:03.40,00:37:03.40,first 15 days. Started out as a very strong
640,00:37:06.07,00:37:06.07,"tribe, unbeatable, won every immunity, then suddenly your"
641,00:37:09.27,00:37:09.27,first loss. Results in a camp raid.
642,00:37:11.23,00:37:11.23,Then you lose immunity and here you are tonight.
643,00:37:13.97,00:37:13.97,"Tammy, tonight, as of now what is the mood of this tribe?"
644,00:37:17.50,00:37:17.50,>> I think we're still very upbeat.
645,00:37:19.27,00:37:19.27,"I mean, it was going to happen sometime that we would lose"
646,00:37:22.27,00:37:22.27,"immunity or lose some challenge, so it was just a matter time."
647,00:37:25.53,00:37:25.53,But we had a good roll and we're still optimistic that we're
648,00:37:28.13,00:37:28.13,going to keep winning. >> PROBST: Anybody in here the
649,00:37:31.20,00:37:31.20,"jester of the group? So far, Zoe, who within your"
650,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,tribe is the person that can light the mood?
651,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,">> Well, that is definitely Gabriel."
652,00:37:40.20,00:37:40.20,He'll take a really down moment and it will hit just that little
653,00:37:44.47,00:37:44.47,"giggle Gabriel has, just like that."
654,00:37:46.80,00:37:46.80,That's all he has to do is just a little giggle.
655,00:37:49.73,00:37:49.73,">> PROBST: Gabe, one of the benefits of this experience--"
656,00:37:53.30,00:37:53.30,new friendships. Do you trust these guys?
657,00:37:55.90,00:37:55.90,>> Is trust the biggest member of our tribe?
658,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,No. People are here to play the
659,00:38:01.93,00:38:01.93,game. People are here to win a million
660,00:38:03.80,00:38:03.80,"dollars. So trust is fleeting here,"
661,00:38:05.87,00:38:05.87,because there's only going to be one winner.
662,00:38:08.70,00:38:08.70,">> PROBST: John, is there a leader in this tribe?"
663,00:38:10.97,00:38:10.97,">> I would say if anything, I think I've stepped up if you"
664,00:38:13.60,00:38:13.60,"want to call it a leader, but I wouldn't say that I'm a leader,"
665,00:38:16.67,00:38:16.67,"you know, like most people would think."
666,00:38:18.70,00:38:18.70,But I have definite leadership qualities.
667,00:38:20.83,00:38:20.83,>> PROBST: At this point in the game is it good to be a leader
668,00:38:23.50,00:38:23.50,"because you still want a strong tribe, or are you setting"
669,00:38:25.97,00:38:25.97,"yourself apart a little and letting people know that, hmm,"
670,00:38:29.03,00:38:29.03,"he's a bright guy, got to keep an eye out."
671,00:38:31.27,00:38:31.27,">> I think being, basically, it's coming out of the shadows"
672,00:38:35.10,00:38:35.10,and into the light puts you at risk to a certain extent.
673,00:38:38.43,00:38:38.43,">> PROBST: If you were betting tonight, how confident are you"
674,00:38:40.93,00:38:40.93,that you're not going home? >> That's an evil question.
675,00:38:45.33,00:38:45.33,"I mean, you know, if you want on honest answer, I feel pretty"
676,00:38:48.73,00:38:48.73,"confident that I'm not, but again, you know, anything is"
677,00:38:53.00,00:38:53.00,possible. >> PROBST: We're going to vote
678,00:38:54.50,00:38:54.50,"here in just a minute. But before we get to that,"
679,00:38:56.33,00:38:56.33,"what's the voting criteria going to be tonight, Rob?"
680,00:38:58.83,00:38:58.83,">> Tonight, I'm going to vote for what I think will be in my"
681,00:39:01.83,00:39:01.83,"best interest. >> PROBST: So at this point,"
682,00:39:04.00,00:39:04.00,"it's an individual vote for you? >> I think all votes, when it"
683,00:39:07.77,00:39:07.77,"comes down to it, are individual votes."
684,00:39:10.53,00:39:10.53,"When we come to Tribal Council, I think people in general are"
685,00:39:14.03,00:39:14.03,looking out for themselves. >> PROBST: All right.
686,00:39:16.77,00:39:16.77,"It's time to vote. Gabe, you're first."
687,00:39:50.70,00:39:50.70,>> I'm voting for Gabriel. You just proved yourself
688,00:39:53.70,00:39:53.70,untrustworthy and we're too far into the game at this point to
689,00:39:56.70,00:39:56.70,be wishy-washy. >> You've made it clear from the
690,00:40:44.57,00:40:44.57,"beginning, you're not here to play the game."
691,00:40:46.80,00:40:46.80,"You don't care about the money, and I'm here to play the game"
692,00:40:50.23,00:40:50.23,and I care about the money. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
693,00:40:59.07,00:40:59.07,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
694,00:41:17.57,00:41:17.57,decision is final. The person will be asked to
695,00:41:19.53,00:41:19.53,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
696,00:41:21.13,00:41:21.13,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Gabe."
697,00:41:35.27,00:41:35.27,Gabe. Two votes Gabe.
698,00:41:43.80,00:41:43.80,Three votes Gabe. That's four votes Gabe.
699,00:41:55.47,00:41:55.47,"First person voted out of Rotu, Gabe."
700,00:42:00.10,00:42:00.10,I don't need to read the other votes.
701,00:42:01.80,00:42:01.80,"You need to bring me your torch, Gabe."
702,00:42:10.30,00:42:10.30,"Gabe, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
703,00:42:27.83,00:42:27.83,"In voting out Gabe, you vote out a guy who appears to be strong,"
704,00:42:31.30,00:42:31.30,"kept your spirits up, works hard."
705,00:42:34.13,00:42:34.13,We'll see how it plays out. You can get your torches and
706,00:42:36.17,00:42:36.17,head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes
707,00:42:51.43,00:42:51.43,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
708,00:42:57.60,00:42:57.60, Survivor... Paschal is stunned to learn Gabe
709,00:42:59.87,00:42:59.87,had been voted off Rotu. >> I was bitterly disappointed.
710,00:43:02.67,00:43:02.67,>> I knew that would break his heart.
711,00:43:03.97,00:43:03.97,">> What a kid. >> PROBST: Back at Rotu, Gabe's"
712,00:43:07.03,00:43:07.03,departure has left John firmly in control.
713,00:43:09.10,00:43:09.10,>> Everyone knows I'm running the show.
714,00:43:10.50,00:43:10.50,>> PROBST: But Boston Rob's not buying it.
715,00:43:12.03,00:43:12.03,">> Do I have ""stupid"" written on my forehead?"
716,00:43:22.17,00:43:22.17,>> I miss you guys already. The experience of being with all
717,00:43:25.63,00:43:25.63,"of you, even the new members, was really, really fantastic."
718,00:43:29.50,00:43:29.50,"But I came to experience the game, not to play the game, so"
719,00:43:34.27,00:43:34.27,this is... looks like perfect timing.
720,00:43:37.37,00:43:37.37,"You guys play safe, all right? Have a good time."
