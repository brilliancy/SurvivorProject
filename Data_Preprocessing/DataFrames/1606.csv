3,00:00:04.83,00:00:04.83,idol on Exile Island and replaced it with a fake one as a
4,00:00:08.46,00:00:08.46,decoy. The idol put Ozzy and his
5,00:00:12.54,00:00:12.54,"alliance of Amanda, Parvati, and James in control of the game."
6,00:00:17.25,00:00:17.25,">> It's in our little four clique, and I think it's going"
7,00:00:19.71,00:00:19.71,to stay in our little four clique.
8,00:00:21.25,00:00:21.25,>> JEFF: But their control was short-lived....
9,00:00:23.04,00:00:23.04,Drop your buffs. We are switching tribes.
10,00:00:25.58,00:00:25.58,...as the fans and favorites were mixed.
11,00:00:27.75,00:00:27.75,You must choose somebody from the opposite tribe.
12,00:00:30.38,00:00:30.38,>> James. >> JEFF: James joins the new
13,00:00:33.04,00:00:33.04,Airai tribe. Ozzy's alliance was split when
14,00:00:35.58,00:00:35.58,"James and Parvati went to Airai. >> Oh, don't look so pissed off."
15,00:00:38.75,00:00:38.75,"The new Malakal tribe combined Ozzy, Amanda, Amy, and Cirie"
16,00:00:43.46,00:00:43.46,"from the favorites with Joel, Erik, Tracy, and Chet from the"
17,00:00:47.96,00:00:47.96,"fans. The new Airai combined James,"
18,00:00:52.21,00:00:52.21,"Parvati, Jonathan, and Eliza from the favorites with Natalie,"
19,00:00:56.79,00:00:56.79,"Alexis, Jason, and Kathy from the fans."
20,00:01:01.04,00:01:01.04,At the new Airai... >> Ow!
21,00:01:05.25,00:01:05.25,Damn it! >> JEFF: Jonathan was seriously
22,00:01:07.58,00:01:07.58,injured and required stitches. But his injury didn't keep his
23,00:01:11.83,00:01:11.83,tribe from winning immunity. Airai wins!
24,00:01:15.71,00:01:15.71,"At Malakal, Joel came up with a plan."
25,00:01:19.00,00:01:19.00,>> What do you think? >> JEFF: But the favorites had a
26,00:01:25.08,00:01:25.08,different idea. >> Joel is a bigger threat for
27,00:01:27.88,00:01:27.88,"us than Chet is. >> JEFF: At tribal council, the"
28,00:01:31.58,00:01:31.58,fans on the new Malakal tribe got a firsthand lesson on how
29,00:01:35.04,00:01:35.04,the favorites operate. The favorites used Tracy and
30,00:01:39.12,00:01:39.12,"Chet to blindside Joel. Joel, the tribe has spoken."
31,00:01:43.50,00:01:43.50,15 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
32,00:02:09.08,00:02:09.08,">> Joel just kind of sat there just in disbelief, and then at"
33,00:02:11.46,00:02:11.46,"the end of it, he didn't, like, make any emotion at all."
34,00:02:14.71,00:02:14.71,And then he was gone. I felt pretty shafted to see
35,00:02:19.42,00:02:19.42,"Joel go. I mean, those guys are tough as"
36,00:02:21.71,00:02:21.71,nails. You cannot trust favorites at
37,00:02:23.96,00:02:23.96,all. They're tanks.
38,00:02:28.04,00:02:28.04,"I mean, they have armor on. If the playing field has been"
39,00:02:31.58,00:02:31.58,lowered to lying and just tricking people straight to
40,00:02:35.25,00:02:35.25,"their face, I think I might have to do some of that."

44,00:03:59.83,00:03:59.83,>> Whatever. >> We had no other choice.
45,00:04:01.62,00:04:01.62,Joel was popping anyway. It was so hard to vote off Joel.
46,00:04:07.12,00:04:07.12,They had four and we had four. And we should have gained
47,00:04:09.67,00:04:09.67,control against the favorites. But Joel was hell bent on
48,00:04:12.17,00:04:12.17,"getting rid of Chet, taking away my alliance."
49,00:04:15.12,00:04:15.12,So what are you going to do? And this is absolutely driving
50,00:04:18.46,00:04:18.46,me batty not being in control. >> ...to bend over.
51,00:04:31.04,00:04:31.04,>> These guys are vicious. >> They are so vicious.
52,00:04:36.33,00:04:36.33,And I think you are next to go. You're a threat.
53,00:04:39.83,00:04:39.83,They don't want to compete against you.
54,00:04:45.25,00:04:45.25,">> Yeah, they aren't going to take you with them."
55,00:04:47.04,00:04:47.04,You need to understand that. They're not going to take me
56,00:04:49.33,00:04:49.33,with them. The only thing that we can do is
57,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,to try to get one of them to vote with us.
58,00:04:52.79,00:04:52.79,"If we can get one of them off, then we're back."
59,00:04:54.54,00:04:54.54,That's all we need. I'm just going to boil a bunch
60,00:05:06.75,00:05:06.75,to get it really soft. >> You look like a chicken
61,00:05:09.17,00:05:09.17,farmer. >> Are you doing okay?
62,00:05:16.96,00:05:16.96,>> Mm-hmm. >> Right where you are right now
63,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,is where I was when I first came here.
64,00:05:25.12,00:05:25.12,">> Tracy seemed like she'd given up, so I went and had a pep talk"
65,00:05:28.17,00:05:28.17,"with her. Even though I'm, like, at the"
66,00:05:30.42,00:05:30.42,"bottom of the rung in the old Malakal, I'm not going to be poo"
67,00:05:33.12,00:05:33.12,"pants, because the more you're poo pants, the sooner you're"
68,00:05:35.92,00:05:35.92,going out. You've just got to keep on
69,00:05:38.12,00:05:38.12,"going, you know? >> Thanks."
70,00:05:41.25,00:05:41.25,">> Yeah, of course. I just don't like to see when"
71,00:05:44.67,00:05:44.67,somebody is having a really rough time.
72,00:05:46.71,00:05:46.71,And I know how it feels. >> I was never part of the
73,00:05:49.88,00:05:49.88,"original alliance between James, Parvati, Cirie, Amanda, and"
74,00:05:52.96,00:05:52.96,Ozzy. So I'm also in a very vulnerable
75,00:05:55.71,00:05:55.71,situation. Maybe I need to play the game a
76,00:05:59.21,00:05:59.21,"little differently, but I'm thinking in baby steps right"
77,00:06:01.62,00:06:01.62,"now, and we'll see what happens. >> It's feeling better."
78,00:06:20.42,00:06:20.42,"More slowly than I wish, but it is getting there."
79,00:06:23.08,00:06:23.08,"No question. But it would just suck, because"
80,00:06:34.38,00:06:34.38,"he's really a good motivator, a good guy to have around."
81,00:06:52.62,00:06:52.62,">> I loved it. I think we turned out... I mean,"
82,00:06:55.00,00:06:55.00,"we got the wrong beach, we got the better tribe, for sure."
83,00:06:59.04,00:06:59.04,>> Fans versus favorites is over in my mind.
84,00:07:02.17,00:07:02.17,"As a new Airai tribe, we are four fans and four favorites,"
85,00:07:05.33,00:07:05.33,"but I think once we earn the fans' trust, Jonathan and I are"
86,00:07:09.08,00:07:09.08,"going to try to work with them, and definitely get rid of"
87,00:07:11.62,00:07:11.62,Parvati and James before there is any type of merge and they
88,00:07:14.08,00:07:14.08,can get back with Amanda and Ozzy.
89,00:07:29.04,00:07:29.04,">> JEFF: Come on in, guys! Malakal, come on in."
90,00:07:45.00,00:07:45.00,Airai getting your first look at the new Malakal tribe.
91,00:07:47.42,00:07:47.42,>> Joel is out? >> JEFF: Joel voted out at the
92,00:07:49.08,00:07:49.08,last tribal council. >> JEFF: You guys ready to get
93,00:07:57.08,00:07:57.08,to today's challenge? >> Yeah.
94,00:07:58.46,00:07:58.46,">> Yeah. >> JEFF: On my go, both tribes"
95,00:08:00.50,00:08:00.50,"will swim out and collect several bundles of planks,"
96,00:08:03.08,00:08:03.08,"sticks, and rope. You'll have ten minutes to use"
97,00:08:06.00,00:08:06.00,these materials to build a blockade in the other tribe's
98,00:08:08.88,00:08:08.88,"tunnel. Once the ten minutes are up,"
99,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,you'll then race to tear down the blockade that the other
100,00:08:15.92,00:08:15.92,tribe built in your tunnel. First tribe to get all their
101,00:08:18.71,00:08:18.71,members through their tunnel and on the mat win reward.
102,00:08:21.71,00:08:21.71,Want to know what you're playing for?
103,00:08:24.33,00:08:24.33,>> Yes. >> Yeah.
104,00:08:26.08,00:08:26.08,">> JEFF: For the winning tribe, two native Micronesians who"
105,00:08:28.12,00:08:28.12,spent their entire life living off this land will come to your
106,00:08:31.25,00:08:31.25,camp and show you how to get the most out of it.
107,00:08:34.62,00:08:34.62,"If you pay attention, it will change camp life."
108,00:08:37.96,00:08:37.96,Worth playing for? >> Yes.
109,00:08:39.88,00:08:39.88,">> Absolutely! >> JEFF: In addition, the"
110,00:08:41.62,00:08:41.62,winning tribe will choose one member from the losing tribe to
111,00:08:43.29,00:08:43.29,go to Exile Island. You will also select one member
112,00:08:45.54,00:08:45.54,from your own tribe to join them.
113,00:08:48.17,00:08:48.17,"On Exile, you'll find a clue to the whereabouts of the hidden"
114,00:08:50.83,00:08:50.83,"immunity idol. Airai, you have one extra"
115,00:08:52.71,00:08:52.71,member. Sitting somebody out.
116,00:08:54.62,00:08:54.62,Cannot sit out the same person in back-to-back challenges.
117,00:08:56.83,00:08:56.83,Who's it going to be? >> I think I can be very helpful
118,00:08:59.12,00:08:59.12,in putting this together and pushing through.
119,00:09:01.38,00:09:01.38,Absolutely. >> I'll sit out.
120,00:09:03.83,00:09:03.83,>> JEFF: Natalie is going to sit this one out.
121,00:09:05.42,00:09:05.42,"Take a spot on the bench, give you a minute to strategize."
122,00:09:07.08,00:09:07.08,We'll get started. Here we go.
123,00:09:10.33,00:09:10.33,For reward. Survivors ready?
124,00:09:12.62,00:09:12.62,"Go! You've got to swim out, collect"
125,00:09:17.71,00:09:17.71,"all your materials, get them back to your mat before you can"
126,00:09:22.08,00:09:22.08,start building. Ozzy first to the platform for
127,00:09:27.54,00:09:27.54,Malakal. Jason right behind for Airai.

134,00:09:50.62,00:09:50.62,for Malakal. Penner really limping on that
135,00:09:53.42,00:09:53.42,bad leg. Trying to muscle them up.
136,00:10:01.04,00:10:01.04,Penner takes a big fall. That leg is really giving him
137,00:10:03.29,00:10:03.29,"trouble. Malakal, you have everything."
138,00:10:09.08,00:10:09.08,Start building! Airai has everything back.
139,00:10:16.33,00:10:16.33,They're building. You have ten minutes to use all
140,00:10:19.29,00:10:19.29,these materials to build a blockade in the other tribe's
141,00:10:22.08,00:10:22.08,tunnel. You're trying to prevent them
142,00:10:24.42,00:10:24.42,"from getting through. >> JEFF: Cirie, Ozzy, and Tracy"
143,00:10:38.38,00:10:38.38,have got a blockade going in the front.

145,00:10:45.83,00:10:45.83,You have five minutes left. Last 30 seconds.
146,00:11:00.00,00:11:00.00,Make them count. Big reward.
147,00:11:05.25,00:11:05.25,"When the time is up, I'm going to tell to you switch sides, and"
148,00:11:07.54,00:11:07.54,you will start tearing down what the other tribe has built up.
149,00:11:11.42,00:11:11.42,"Five, four, three, two, one."
150,00:11:15.79,00:11:15.79,Switch. Now your goal is to get through
151,00:11:19.33,00:11:19.33,the blockade the other tribe just created.
152,00:11:22.25,00:11:22.25,Malakal making quick work of Airai's first big blockade.
153,00:11:27.00,00:11:27.00,The Airai tribe having a little more trouble.

157,00:11:39.12,00:11:39.12,"Penner, bad leg and all, ripping those planks out of there."

162,00:11:57.42,00:11:57.42,through the tunnel and onto the mat.
163,00:12:00.71,00:12:00.71,Doesn't matter if you leave any of the blockade behind.

170,00:12:19.33,00:12:19.33,They got through the first big blockade and that's all there
171,00:12:21.75,00:12:21.75,"was. Eliza is out, Parvati is out."
172,00:12:24.08,00:12:24.08,Malakal falling behind now. Alexis is through.

192,00:13:37.25,00:13:37.25,Utilize these guys. Ask them every question you can
193,00:13:39.54,00:13:39.54,"think of. Before that happens, Penner,"
194,00:13:42.46,00:13:42.46,medical's going to take a look at that knee.
195,00:14:01.50,00:14:01.50,">> Do you have any pain in your groin at all, up in here?"
196,00:14:05.92,00:14:05.92,"Is it a bit tender in here? >> Yeah, a little bit, but not"
197,00:14:08.12,00:14:08.12,"terrible. >> See, I mean, Jonathan,"
198,00:14:11.00,00:14:11.00,"there's a big abscess in there, a big collection of pus."
199,00:14:13.54,00:14:13.54,This is going to need intravenous antibiotics.
200,00:14:15.92,00:14:15.92,It probably needs surgical washout.
201,00:14:19.12,00:14:19.12,It's not going to be a quick fix.
202,00:14:21.96,00:14:21.96,">> Oh, god bless it. I'm not quitting."
203,00:14:26.62,00:14:26.62,>> I can only recommend that you get treatment in hospital for
204,00:14:30.08,00:14:30.08,the sake of your knee. Antibiotics are not working at
205,00:14:33.29,00:14:33.29,this stage. It's showing signs of spreading
206,00:14:35.71,00:14:35.71,around your body. It's moved up into your lymph
207,00:14:37.50,00:14:37.50,"nodes. It can make you really, really"
208,00:14:39.50,00:14:39.50,"sick, okay? An infection that goes into your"
209,00:14:41.75,00:14:41.75,bloodstream is potentially fatal.
210,00:14:45.62,00:14:45.62,">> Oh, god! Okay."
211,00:14:53.17,00:14:53.17,">> JEFF: So this isn't a case of ""Another afternoon, I'll come"
212,00:14:57.12,00:14:57.12,"check you later in today""? >> I can only recommend for the"
213,00:15:00.17,00:15:00.17,sake of his leg and his life that he leave the game now.
214,00:15:03.46,00:15:03.46,He needs hospital treatment. It's not going to get better.
215,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,It will just get worse. >> JEFF: What can you do?
216,00:15:11.08,00:15:11.08,">> I know. Sorry, guys."
217,00:15:18.62,00:15:18.62,"Bad luck on Johnny. I had this game, too."
218,00:15:23.54,00:15:23.54,"I saw the daylight. >> JEFF: All right, let's let"
219,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,you say good-bye to your tribe. We'll get you on a boat and get
220,00:15:30.12,00:15:30.12,"you fixed up. >> I'm sorry, guys."
221,00:15:36.75,00:15:36.75,>> It's okay. >> We're sorry.
222,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,>> I couldn't have done everything else.
223,00:15:42.08,00:15:42.08,They did everything they could do.
224,00:15:44.83,00:15:44.83,And they've got to take me to the hospital right now.
225,00:15:47.42,00:15:47.42,I loved hanging out with all you guys.
226,00:15:50.17,00:15:50.17,">> We'll miss you. >> All right, baby."
227,00:15:52.17,00:15:52.17,"Take care. >> Jonathan, you take care of"
228,00:15:54.50,00:15:54.50,yourself. >> We need you.
229,00:15:56.38,00:15:56.38,We need you. I need you.
230,00:15:59.04,00:15:59.04,>> I'm sorry. >> I really hate to see him go.
231,00:16:01.38,00:16:01.38,"He was like the pillar of strength around camp, and, so,"
232,00:16:04.08,00:16:04.08,"yeah, it's... I'm sad to see him go."
233,00:16:10.12,00:16:10.12,"I only knew him for, like, three days, but what I knew, I loved"
234,00:16:12.75,00:16:12.75,"him, you know? >> I'm proud of you guys."
235,00:16:15.96,00:16:15.96,>> You just kicked ass at that last challenge.
236,00:16:18.12,00:16:18.12,">> Have fun, guys. I'll see you at the reunion."
237,00:16:22.79,00:16:22.79,>> All right. >> JEFF: Want me to give you a
238,00:16:27.25,00:16:27.25,"hand? >> I've got it, Jeff."
239,00:16:28.75,00:16:28.75,Thank you. >> JEFF: Take it on your own.
240,00:16:30.38,00:16:30.38,"Hey, hate to see you go, man. Pleasure."
241,00:16:32.25,00:16:32.25,">> Pleasure was mine, buddy. It really was."
242,00:16:34.38,00:16:34.38,I'll see you later. I was kicking ass in this game.
243,00:16:48.17,00:16:48.17,I swear to god. I don't want to be out of the
244,00:16:52.12,00:16:52.12,game. But I don't want to lose my leg.
245,00:16:57.17,00:16:57.17,Couldn't have tried any better. Couldn't have fought any harder.
246,00:17:03.58,00:17:03.58,It was fun while it lasted. >> Poor Jonathan.
247,00:17:27.29,00:17:27.29,">> I needed Jonathan, because these girls are driving me"
248,00:17:29.54,00:17:29.54,"crazy. I'm with a bunch of girls, and"
249,00:17:31.62,00:17:31.62,I'm not that persuasive in the verbal manner to woo people
250,00:17:35.12,00:17:35.12,"on my side, and they are. >> Two guys."
251,00:17:41.67,00:17:41.67,">> If I make it to the merge it's all good, but chances of me"
252,00:17:44.08,00:17:44.08,making it are not that... this is not in my favor right now.
253,00:17:49.62,00:17:49.62,>> Yay! Hi!
254,00:17:54.12,00:17:54.12,>> Hi! >> Welcome.
255,00:17:56.79,00:17:56.79,>> Hi. >> Hi.
256,00:18:08.83,00:18:08.83,">> When Edwin and Joe came, they brought a fishing line."
257,00:18:11.88,00:18:11.88,"They brought an extra machete, a knife, a paring knife."
258,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,">> Yes, I am. >> That's okay."
259,00:18:18.62,00:18:18.62,( laughs ) We can still hang out.
260,00:18:20.88,00:18:20.88,>> They brought a fishing net we can cast out to catch bait.
261,00:18:23.17,00:18:23.17,"They brought vegetables, fruits-- I mean, just amazing,"
262,00:18:26.04,00:18:26.04,amazing stuff. We were thrilled.
263,00:18:28.88,00:18:28.88,">> The first thing we'll do, I'm going to set up the bait for the"
264,00:18:32.17,00:18:32.17,crab. We'll show you how to do it.
265,00:18:37.25,00:18:37.25,">> Yeah, great. >> And then after that, we're"
266,00:18:39.83,00:18:39.83,going to show you how to fish. >> I got one.
267,00:19:29.79,00:19:29.79,>> Yay! >> I think this is one of the
268,00:19:33.17,00:19:33.17,"best rewards we've gotten, because we can actually"
269,00:19:36.50,00:19:36.50,continually use this knowledge and come out here and fish in
270,00:19:38.75,00:19:38.75,the morning instead of eating just coconuts day after day
271,00:19:41.62,00:19:41.62,after day. It's going to be amazing for us.
272,00:19:44.88,00:19:44.88,>> Yeah! >> Attagirl!
273,00:20:06.50,00:20:06.50,">> They're, like, slowing us down."
274,00:20:08.08,00:20:08.08,I felt like the challenge today was us four against the whole
275,00:20:09.79,00:20:09.79,tribe over there. >> Yeah.
276,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,>> Did you feel like that? >> Yeah.
277,00:20:25.50,00:20:25.50,">> ...and I lost, I couldn't go back to my job."
278,00:20:28.25,00:20:28.25,( laughter ) >> Yeah.
279,00:20:31.29,00:20:31.29,We lost the reward challenge today.
280,00:20:33.04,00:20:33.04,It's our third challenge in a row that we lost as the new
281,00:20:34.92,00:20:34.92,Malakal tribe. We just don't work well as a
282,00:20:38.58,00:20:38.58,team. And we need the fans to step it
283,00:20:41.75,00:20:41.75,"up. >> She's like, what, 53?"
284,00:20:45.08,00:20:45.08,At least 55. It's just... you know what's
285,00:20:49.17,00:20:49.17,getting on my nerves? That not only do you have to
286,00:20:51.42,00:20:51.42,"play the game, you have to teach them the game, too."
287,00:20:54.42,00:20:54.42,I don't want to teach. >> It's starting to kind of get
288,00:20:57.96,00:20:57.96,"to me, the fan bashing. Yeah, they seem slow and they're"
289,00:21:00.38,00:21:00.38,"not doing anything, but you know what?"
290,00:21:03.17,00:21:03.17,"They're coming around. And we were there once, too."
291,00:21:05.08,00:21:05.08,"So I'm kind of starting to feel, you know what?"
292,00:21:06.92,00:21:06.92,Why not give them a chance? >> I thought about your
293,00:21:12.00,00:21:12.00,"position, and if we can stick together and help each other"
294,00:21:14.75,00:21:14.75,"out, then... >> How tight are you and Cirie,"
295,00:21:17.08,00:21:17.08,pretty tight? >> No.
296,00:21:19.00,00:21:19.00,">> When you guys first came to camp, I was happy to vote for"
297,00:21:20.88,00:21:20.88,Cirie then. >> I know Erik wants to vote for
298,00:21:23.38,00:21:23.38,her. >> Really?
299,00:21:25.29,00:21:25.29,">> Who else would vote for her? >> Chet, me, Erik, and you, and"
300,00:21:27.50,00:21:27.50,then she'd be gone. And I'd feel better.
301,00:21:30.25,00:21:30.25,It's just that she's got such a cute smile and you want to trust
302,00:21:33.12,00:21:33.12,"her. >> She's really sweet, but"
303,00:21:35.42,00:21:35.42,"there's that side that's like... see, that's exactly why I came"
304,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,and talked to you guys. I had the same uneasy feeling.
305,00:21:42.58,00:21:42.58,"I'm really conflicted right now. The thing is, I just don't trust"
306,00:21:47.12,00:21:47.12,"Cirie, I just don't. She screwed me over once when"
307,00:21:50.29,00:21:50.29,she voted out Yau-Man. And I feel it coming again.
308,00:21:54.12,00:21:54.12,>> I hope so. >> I really trust you.
309,00:21:56.75,00:21:56.75,">> You should. >> I really, really trust you."
310,00:21:58.50,00:21:58.50,">> Look, I'll look you right... I trust you."
311,00:22:00.58,00:22:00.58,">> I trust you, too. >> Okay?"
312,00:22:02.25,00:22:02.25,>> Okay. Do you feel so much better?
313,00:22:04.00,00:22:04.00,">> Oh, my gosh, yes. >> Like a new person."
314,00:22:05.54,00:22:05.54,>> Like a whole new person. I'm giving all my trust to you.
315,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,>> Okay. >> Take care of me.
316,00:22:09.29,00:22:09.29,"Take care of me, you guys, please, because I'm really"
317,00:22:11.08,00:22:11.08,"sticking my neck out there, you guys."
318,00:22:18.46,00:22:18.46,>> I wonder if Jason found the idol.
319,00:22:20.62,00:22:20.62,Chet probably got under that little cave and just stayed
320,00:22:22.62,00:22:22.62,there. >> I have the real immunity
321,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,"idol, and after I found the immunity idol, I decided to"
322,00:22:29.92,00:22:29.92,"fashion a fake one of my own, and I wrapped it back up and hid"
323,00:22:33.25,00:22:33.25,it right back where I found it. I really want Jason to find the
324,00:22:37.25,00:22:37.25,"fake one, because, from what I've heard, he might be naive"
325,00:22:41.79,00:22:41.79,enough to believe that it's the real one and use it in some
326,00:22:45.58,00:22:45.58,manner that might end up getting him voted off.
327,00:23:04.04,00:23:04.04,>> We can just do what we need to do for us.
328,00:23:05.88,00:23:05.88,">> Yeah, take your time. I'm just going to go, like, get"
329,00:23:07.79,00:23:07.79,"a little organized, and then maybe go search or something."
330,00:23:10.38,00:23:10.38,>> Okay. That's fine.
331,00:23:13.08,00:23:13.08,">> The other day, in one of the challenges, I got a piece of"
332,00:23:16.08,00:23:16.08,"coral sort of wedged up into my foot, and it really hurts, like,"
333,00:23:19.00,00:23:19.00,really bad and it's sort of like an infection.
334,00:23:22.08,00:23:22.08,"So I feel like I'm at the end of my tether right now, and I don't"
335,00:23:24.29,00:23:24.29,"it to get any worse or anything. I mean, obviously my health is"
336,00:23:27.12,00:23:27.12,"more important right now. >> ""Clue number one."
337,00:23:30.50,00:23:30.50,To progress further go back to the start.
338,00:23:33.04,00:23:33.04,"The thing which you covet requires ascension."""
339,00:23:37.79,00:23:37.79,"Chet believes Ozzy holds the hidden immunity idol already, so"
340,00:23:41.08,00:23:41.08,I think he's given up on the hope of finding it.
341,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50,"Me, on the other hand, you know, I'm going to keep looking and"
342,00:23:47.38,00:23:47.38,"see what happens. ""Continue your quest by crossing"
343,00:23:50.12,00:23:50.12,"the ocean. You've done it before, now"
344,00:23:53.33,00:23:53.33,"repeat the motion."" Back over."

349,00:24:36.79,00:24:36.79,carving of a piece of wood with a little guy on it.
350,00:24:41.12,00:24:41.12,And... this is pretty incredible.
351,00:24:45.58,00:24:45.58,"So, you know, I'm going to have to hold on to this tight."
352,00:24:47.83,00:24:47.83,"This means Ozzy doesn't have it. I have it, so this is really"
353,00:24:50.46,00:24:50.46,good for me. Sweet!
354,00:25:03.08,00:25:03.08,>> See that? See that?
355,00:25:06.00,00:25:06.00,See that? Come here.
356,00:25:08.75,00:25:08.75,"Right here. It's eating now, it's eating."
357,00:25:11.17,00:25:11.17,"Right there, see? See that?"
358,00:25:13.46,00:25:13.46,>> Yeah. Come here.
359,00:25:28.21,00:25:28.21,>> So where's your plate? >> Right here.
360,00:25:30.12,00:25:30.12,My god. It's so good.
361,00:25:32.21,00:25:32.21,">> I love garlic, anything in garlic."
362,00:25:34.96,00:25:34.96,">> Oh, the fish stew is hands down the best meal we've had so"
363,00:25:38.75,00:25:38.75,far. It was delicious.
364,00:25:41.33,00:25:41.33,"I think we had 25 different types of fish tonight, on top of"
365,00:25:44.04,00:25:44.04,"all the incredible seasonings that they brought with them, and"
366,00:25:46.33,00:25:46.33,just kind of showing us how to do it.
367,00:25:49.96,00:25:49.96,">> Oh, it smells good! >> Oh!"
368,00:25:52.46,00:25:52.46,">> Oh, boy! ( speaking a Micronesian"

375,00:26:35.96,00:26:35.96,>> Holy crapola. >> JEFF: We'll now bring in Chet
376,00:26:40.12,00:26:40.12,and Jason returning from Exile Island.

378,00:26:47.46,00:26:47.46,">> Tough days. >> Jason, we lost Jonathan."
379,00:26:49.92,00:26:49.92,>> Because of his leg? >> He had to go.
380,00:26:52.75,00:26:52.75,">> JEFF: All right, let me catch everybody up."
381,00:26:56.04,00:26:56.04,"Jonathan Penner is, obviously, not here."
382,00:26:58.46,00:26:58.46,"I think everybody here knows that at a previous challenge, he"
383,00:27:01.25,00:27:01.25,got injured. The doctors came in to check his
384,00:27:03.46,00:27:03.46,stitches. They saw that an infection had
385,00:27:05.58,00:27:05.58,started. They assessed it and made the
386,00:27:08.12,00:27:08.12,"decision that it was too risky to let him stay in the game,"
387,00:27:11.62,00:27:11.62,"because if the infection spread, it would become life-"
388,00:27:14.62,00:27:14.62,"threatening. They took him to the hospital,"
389,00:27:17.04,00:27:17.04,"performed surgery, opened up the wound, cleaned it out."
390,00:27:19.92,00:27:19.92,"He's doing fine. So we're now even, seven-seven,"
391,00:27:23.83,00:27:23.83,again. Game continues.
392,00:27:27.42,00:27:27.42,"Switching topics. Chet, Jason, did you guys have"
393,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,any time to look for the idol out on Exile?
394,00:27:34.17,00:27:34.17,">> Well, yeah, it was a long time out there."
395,00:27:36.54,00:27:36.54,But I kind of gave up. And the conclusion I've come to
396,00:27:38.92,00:27:38.92,right now is that Ozzy has already discovered the hidden
397,00:27:41.75,00:27:41.75,"immunity idol. >> JEFF: Ozzy, interesting play"
398,00:27:44.54,00:27:44.54,going on. Only a few people have been to
399,00:27:47.04,00:27:47.04,"Exile, so only a few of you really know the truth about"
400,00:27:50.12,00:27:50.12,what's happening out there. >> I don't know if he isn't that
401,00:27:54.08,00:27:54.08,"good at following clues, or if someone else has found it."
402,00:27:57.38,00:27:57.38,I guess we're only going to find out in the next couple of days.
403,00:28:00.38,00:28:00.38,>> JEFF: All right. You guys ready to get to today's
404,00:28:03.71,00:28:03.71,immunity challenge? >> Yep.
405,00:28:05.96,00:28:05.96,">> JEFF: For today's challenge, both tribes will use stepping"
406,00:28:08.83,00:28:08.83,poles to transfer two tribe members from one large platform
407,00:28:13.21,00:28:13.21,to another. All seven tribe members must
408,00:28:17.17,00:28:17.17,then swim out to a final very small tower.
409,00:28:20.62,00:28:20.62,First tribe to get all seven tribe members to the top of the
410,00:28:24.00,00:28:24.00,"tower with both feet on or above the top deck wins immunity, safe"
411,00:28:28.08,00:28:28.08,"from tribal council. Losers, date with me."
412,00:28:32.17,00:28:32.17,Somebody going home. We are even at seven-seven.
413,00:28:34.75,00:28:34.75,Nobody sitting it out. I'll give you a chance to
414,00:28:36.79,00:28:36.79,strategize. We'll get started.
415,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,Here we go. For immunity.
416,00:28:44.08,00:28:44.08,Survivors ready? Go!
417,00:28:48.42,00:28:48.42,It's a big collision as you've got to switch lanes to begin.
418,00:28:51.88,00:28:51.88,"First step, untie the stepping poles."
419,00:28:56.29,00:28:56.29,Tracy and Ami going to be carried across the water for
420,00:29:00.54,00:29:00.54,Malakal. Eliza and Parvati for Airai.
421,00:29:04.04,00:29:04.04,Takes a lot of teamwork in this challenge.
422,00:29:06.92,00:29:06.92,">> Okay, I'm on. >> Way to go, guys."
423,00:29:15.33,00:29:15.33,"Slow and steady. >> JEFF: Wow, Airai trying to"
424,00:29:17.83,00:29:17.83,"outthink the challenge, not using two poles."
425,00:29:21.33,00:29:21.33,>> Way to go. >> JEFF: James carrying the
426,00:29:23.83,00:29:23.83,pole. The rest of the tribe keeping it
427,00:29:26.62,00:29:26.62,"steady. If it works, it is a great"
428,00:29:29.04,00:29:29.04,strategy. And it does.
429,00:29:31.83,00:29:31.83,"Eliza is across. Great idea, great execution by"
430,00:29:34.62,00:29:34.62,Airai. Not the way this challenge was
431,00:29:38.17,00:29:38.17,designed or the way we thought it would go.
432,00:29:41.42,00:29:41.42,Airai going to try it again with Parvati.
433,00:29:46.67,00:29:46.67,Can she keep her balance? Malakal sticking with their plan
434,00:29:52.12,00:29:52.12,of using both poles. They have not stolen Airai's
435,00:29:55.75,00:29:55.75,strategy. James is powering Airai to a
436,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,huge lead. Airai has-- oh!
437,00:30:05.33,00:30:05.33,Oh! It almost worked.
438,00:30:07.92,00:30:07.92,">> Wait, she didn't touch... >> No, you're down."
439,00:30:10.12,00:30:10.12,You're using the ladder. All the way to the back.
440,00:30:13.38,00:30:13.38,Airai was very close. Parvati fell off at the last
441,00:30:17.25,00:30:17.25,second. Got to go all the way back to
442,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,the start. Airai giving it another go.
443,00:30:29.25,00:30:29.25,"Parvati trying to balance again. Malakal taking a lot of time,"
444,00:30:35.67,00:30:35.67,making very little progress. Airai very close again.
445,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,Will it work? Parvati's across.
446,00:30:51.21,00:30:51.21,Eliza's across. Everybody to the platform.
447,00:30:58.12,00:30:58.12,Malakal still working on their first tribe member as Airai
448,00:31:01.29,00:31:01.29,climbs up the final tower. You've got to get all seven
449,00:31:05.08,00:31:05.08,"people on or above the top deck. >> Help me, help me, somebody."
450,00:31:11.25,00:31:11.25,>> JEFF: Cirie is losing it. Tracy very close.
451,00:31:15.12,00:31:15.12,Can she get there from there? She is.
452,00:31:17.71,00:31:17.71,Malakal has the first tribe member across.
453,00:31:19.79,00:31:19.79,They're heading back to pick up Ami.
454,00:31:21.83,00:31:21.83,"Everyone in Airai hanging on to James, trying to figure out how"
455,00:31:25.17,00:31:25.17,to get seven people on a platform built for five.
456,00:31:30.75,00:31:30.75,Immunity at stake. Malakal now using Airai's
457,00:31:36.12,00:31:36.12,strategy. Are they too late?
458,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,">> Okay, my foot's up. >> One, two, three."
459,00:31:43.62,00:31:43.62,>> Jeff! >> JEFF: Airai has it!
460,00:31:46.46,00:31:46.46,"Airai wins immunity! Airai, creative thinking made"
461,00:32:02.71,00:32:02.71,that a very easy win for you guys.
462,00:32:05.62,00:32:05.62,Come on over and get immunity. Congratulations.
463,00:32:13.88,00:32:13.88,No tribal council for Airai. Safe in this game at least one
464,00:32:16.62,00:32:16.62,"more day. Malakal, tribal council tonight."
465,00:32:19.54,00:32:19.54,One of you going home. You have the afternoon to figure
466,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,it out. I'll see you at tribal.
467,00:32:24.04,00:32:24.04,"Get in your boat and head back. >> Well, if he had to have"
468,00:32:52.08,00:32:52.08,"immediate surgery, it's pretty bad."
469,00:32:54.08,00:32:54.08,">> I expected him to go out in, like, a ball of blazing..."
470,00:32:57.17,00:32:57.17,>> Blazing glory. >> Yeah.
471,00:33:04.54,00:33:04.54,>> How are you feeling? >> A fish hook?
472,00:33:06.29,00:33:06.29,Why? >> I need to do some surgery on
473,00:33:08.00,00:33:08.00,my foot. >> No!
474,00:33:09.54,00:33:09.54,">> Look at this. Isn't this, like, a pocket of"
475,00:33:11.42,00:33:11.42,just pus? >> I would not open that out
476,00:33:13.04,00:33:13.04,here. >> That's what's hurt.
477,00:33:15.21,00:33:15.21,That's what it is. I just want to open it up and
478,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,get that out and the pain will be gone.
479,00:33:18.96,00:33:18.96,">> Don't do that. >> You ready to go, huh?"
480,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,">> Oh, man. Damn."
481,00:33:30.08,00:33:30.08,"Losing everyone. What is going on, man?"
482,00:33:34.12,00:33:34.12,We lost the immunity challenge yet again.
483,00:33:37.67,00:33:37.67,"And all of a sudden, Chet comes up and says, ""Please do me a"
484,00:33:40.58,00:33:40.58,"favor and vote me out tonight."" I was like, ""All right, Chet,"
485,00:33:44.42,00:33:44.42,"we'll vote you out."" Was there any question anyways?"
486,00:33:49.92,00:33:49.92,>> Dropping like flies. >> Took the words out of my
487,00:33:52.17,00:33:52.17,mouth. >> Craziness.
488,00:34:04.62,00:34:04.62,>> Everything frickin' changes on a dime in this game.
489,00:34:08.62,00:34:08.62,">> Chet's injured, he's done. He wants to leave the game by"
490,00:34:11.25,00:34:11.25,"being voted out, because he thinks that's honorable."
491,00:34:13.67,00:34:13.67,"But I think it would be totally more honorable to help Tracy,"
492,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,"his longtime friend since he's been in this game, and myself to"
493,00:34:19.83,00:34:19.83,"get out, like, one of the bigger threats right now."
494,00:34:22.79,00:34:22.79,We need him so bad just so we can get Cirie out right now or
495,00:34:25.71,00:34:25.71,"Ozzy, even. >> What if Ozzy's got the idol?"
496,00:34:36.08,00:34:36.08,">> If Chet makes it all the way until tribal and votes, it would"
497,00:34:38.38,00:34:38.38,be amazing. >> Chet and I are tight.
498,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,"And I understand he's sick, but it is imperative that Chet vote"
499,00:34:45.17,00:34:45.17,"with us today. If he doesn't, I'm screwed."
500,00:34:47.71,00:34:47.71,But I'm not going to put his name down.
501,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,"I won't do it. >> You're just more than ready,"
502,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,"huh? >> Come on, guys."
503,00:35:04.92,00:35:04.92,I have too much going on right now.
504,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,And these last two days have been total hell.
505,00:35:08.46,00:35:08.46,"I can't even think straight. Please, that's all I'm asking."
506,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,">> You could help take Ozzy down, because he's not expecting"
507,00:35:14.75,00:35:14.75,it. This would be the craziest play
508,00:35:17.17,00:35:17.17,ever in the history of this game if you helped us do this.
509,00:35:20.04,00:35:20.04,>> The target keeps changing. Now Erik and Tracy are looking
510,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,"at Ozzy, going, ""Ozzy might have the idol, he's a threat."""
511,00:35:27.71,00:35:27.71,And I'm definitely going to have to deal with Ozzy at some point.
512,00:35:30.42,00:35:30.42,So if Tracey and Erik convince Chet to stay in the game and
513,00:35:34.42,00:35:34.42,"make a vote, I would vote with them."
514,00:35:42.29,00:35:42.29,">> I know. >> If you did this for us, it"
515,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,would be the biggest gift you could give us on the way out to
516,00:35:46.25,00:35:46.25,just take a little pride. Me and Tracy would be so
517,00:35:49.04,00:35:49.04,grateful. We would be amazingly grateful
518,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,"for that, that you could use your last dying breath to do"
519,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,something for us in this game. I would be incredibly grateful.
520,00:35:58.29,00:35:58.29,">> Just think about it, okay? >> I'll think about it."
521,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,Tracy and I committed to each other from day one that we would
522,00:36:03.62,00:36:03.62,"do whatever we could for each other, but I've been having some"
523,00:36:06.17,00:36:06.17,issues with my foot and some other health issues.
524,00:36:08.38,00:36:08.38,I pretty much told them I would take the hit tonight.
525,00:36:11.00,00:36:11.00,But Tracy and Erik have another plan up their sleeve.
526,00:36:13.21,00:36:13.21,They want to use my vote to try to take out Ozzy.
527,00:36:15.54,00:36:15.54,"I did tell Tracy and Erik I would think about it, and I will"
528,00:36:18.21,00:36:18.21,"think about it, but to be honest, I'm not sure what I'm"
529,00:36:20.17,00:36:20.17,"going to do. >> JEFF: Cirie, was there much"
530,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,discussion today about Penner's exit in regards to how difficult
531,00:36:50.67,00:36:50.67,this game really is? >> It just sucks to go out the
532,00:36:54.62,00:36:54.62,way he did. I know if he could have argued
533,00:36:57.67,00:36:57.67,"the point, he would still be here."
534,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,>> JEFF: He tried. >> I'm sure he did.
535,00:37:03.92,00:37:03.92,">> JEFF: Ozzy, when you see somebody go out like that, what"
536,00:37:06.88,00:37:06.88,goes through your head? >> Jonathan is the last
537,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,person... I thought he was just a really strong guy.
538,00:37:11.62,00:37:11.62,"And I've seen him get cut worse, and you don't think a that"
539,00:37:14.75,00:37:14.75,"little bug gets in you, and, boom, you're all of a sudden"
540,00:37:17.38,00:37:17.38,"out of the game. >> JEFF: Erik, at today's"
541,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,"challenge, Jason made a comment after going to Exile, basically"
542,00:37:24.08,00:37:24.08,"saying, ""I've been there. I looked around."
543,00:37:26.46,00:37:26.46,"I think Ozzy has the idol."" Did that put any thoughts in"
544,00:37:28.54,00:37:28.54,your head? >> What Jason said definitely
545,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,put some thoughts in my head. And I wouldn't put it past Ozzy
546,00:37:34.42,00:37:34.42,that he found the idol. That's based on knowing Ozzy.
547,00:37:37.71,00:37:37.71,">> JEFF: Cirie, when you hear Jason's comment, do you, like"
548,00:37:42.62,00:37:42.62,"Erik, believe him at face value? >> No, I don't really take"
549,00:37:47.38,00:37:47.38,anything anybody out here says at face value.
550,00:37:50.96,00:37:50.96,Jason could have it himself and is trying to throw us off his
551,00:37:54.25,00:37:54.25,"track by saying Ozzy had it. >> JEFF: Ozzy, does that concern"
552,00:37:57.04,00:37:57.04,you? >> I'm not the one going home
553,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,"tonight. I mean, everybody knows who's"
554,00:38:01.04,00:38:01.04,"going home, so it's not really of any concern."
555,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,"I mean, if I do get voted off tonight, I will be so blown away"
556,00:38:07.96,00:38:07.96,and so blindsided that I'll just get naked and jump off the pier
557,00:38:13.25,00:38:13.25,"right now. I mean, let's be honest with"
558,00:38:16.83,00:38:16.83,each other right now-- Chet's going home tonight.
559,00:38:19.71,00:38:19.71,"And if somehow everyone is not voting that way, then I have no"
560,00:38:23.67,00:38:23.67,business being here. >> JEFF: You wouldn't be the
561,00:38:26.21,00:38:26.21,"first to be blindsided. >> That's true, that's very"
562,00:38:28.33,00:38:28.33,true. >> JEFF: Chet?
563,00:38:31.04,00:38:31.04,">> Well, the way it's been in every tribal council, there"
564,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,always seems to be an obvious person but it never turns out to
565,00:38:37.29,00:38:37.29,be that person. So I think there's always going
566,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,"to be that uncertainty, and that mix of you never know exactly"
567,00:38:43.25,00:38:43.25,"what's going to happen. >> JEFF: So Amanda, coming to"
568,00:38:46.21,00:38:46.21,"tribal council, you have an idea who you're going to vote for."
569,00:38:49.12,00:38:49.12,You may have an idea who a lot of people are going to vote for.
570,00:38:51.29,00:38:51.29,"From a strategy point of view, do you think twice about"
571,00:38:54.12,00:38:54.12,everything you hear? >> Well I've learned you're
572,00:38:56.67,00:38:56.67,pretty much going to be the one gone if you start feeling
573,00:38:58.38,00:38:58.38,comfortable. So I never feel comfortable.
574,00:39:00.79,00:39:00.79,And even though I'm pretty certain on what's going on
575,00:39:03.50,00:39:03.50,"tonight, you can never be certain in this game."
576,00:39:05.83,00:39:05.83,">> JEFF: Okay, it is time to vote."
577,00:39:09.38,00:39:09.38,"Cirie, you're up. >> Thanks for letting us use you"
578,00:39:30.17,00:39:30.17,"to vote out Joel, and I hope your foot gets better."
579,00:39:51.88,00:39:51.88,>> I'm sorry to see you go. Bye.
580,00:40:15.58,00:40:15.58,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
581,00:40:28.42,00:40:28.42,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
582,00:40:30.33,00:40:30.33,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
583,00:40:38.21,00:40:38.21,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
584,00:40:40.04,00:40:40.04,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
585,00:40:41.75,00:40:41.75,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
586,00:40:45.79,00:40:45.79,"First vote, Chet. Chet."
587,00:40:55.75,00:40:55.75,Two votes Chet. Chet.
588,00:41:02.21,00:41:02.21,That's three votes Chet. Sixth person voted out of
589,00:41:10.38,00:41:10.38,"Survivor: Fans Versus Favorites, Chet."
590,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,"That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch."
591,00:41:22.42,00:41:22.42,"Chet, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
592,00:41:28.21,00:41:28.21,">> Love you guys. >> JEFF: Well, the good news is"
593,00:41:43.33,00:41:43.33,you've lasted 17 days. The bad news is you're down to
594,00:41:45.71,00:41:45.71,six. Got to start winning.
595,00:41:47.88,00:41:47.88,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

601,00:42:16.33,00:42:16.33,The fans at Malakal struggle to stay in the game.
602,00:42:19.12,00:42:19.12,>> I'm going to fight like hell to win immunity.
603,00:42:21.17,00:42:21.17,>> JEFF: While the Airai tribe struggles to stay alive.
604,00:42:23.79,00:42:23.79,>> It's just savagery. It's like you're cavemen.
605,00:42:28.08,00:42:28.08,>> JEFF: And Kathy's hanging on by a thread.
606,00:42:29.96,00:42:29.96,>> It's brutally torturous. >> I decided at the end not to
607,00:42:39.58,00:42:39.58,go with Tracy and Erik's plan to blindside Ozzy.
608,00:42:42.04,00:42:42.04,I just felt that's something they can take care of after I'm
609,00:42:45.71,00:42:45.71,gone. I'm very proud of the way I
610,00:42:47.75,00:42:47.75,"played the game. I may be going out now, but I"
611,00:42:49.67,00:42:49.67,lasted a lot longer than some other people thought I would.
612,00:42:51.29,00:42:51.29,"I am so honored to be part of the Survivor family forever, and"
613,00:42:54.08,00:42:54.08,"it has been a great experience, and thank you again."
