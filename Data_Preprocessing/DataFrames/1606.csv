286,00:20:54.42,00:20:54.42,I don't want to teach.>> It's starting to kind of get

300,00:21:30.25,00:21:30.25,It's just that she's got such acute smile and you want to trust
301,00:21:33.12,00:21:33.12,"her.>> She's really sweet, but"
302,00:21:35.42,00:21:35.42,"there's that side that's like...see, that's exactly why I came"

304,00:21:42.58,00:21:42.58,"I'm really conflicted right now.The thing is, I just don't trust"
305,00:21:47.12,00:21:47.12,"Cirie, I just don't.She screwed me over once when"
306,00:21:50.29,00:21:50.29,she voted out Yau-Man.And I feel it coming again.

321,00:22:29.92,00:22:29.92,"fashion a fake one of my own,and I wrapped it back up and hid"
322,00:22:33.25,00:22:33.25,it right back where I found it.I really want Jason to find the
323,00:22:37.25,00:22:37.25,"fake one, because, from whatI've heard, he might be naive"
324,00:22:41.79,00:22:41.79,enough to believe that it's thereal one and use it in some
325,00:22:45.58,00:22:45.58,manner that might end up gettinghim voted off.
326,00:23:04.04,00:23:04.04,>> We can just do what we needto do for us.

379,00:26:52.75,00:26:52.75,">> JEFF: All right, let me catcheverybody up."
380,00:26:56.04,00:26:56.04,"Jonathan Penner is, obviously,not here."
381,00:26:58.46,00:26:58.46,"I think everybody here knowsthat at a previous challenge, he"
382,00:27:01.25,00:27:01.25,got injured.The doctors came in to check his
383,00:27:03.46,00:27:03.46,stitches.They saw that an infection had
384,00:27:05.58,00:27:05.58,started.They assessed it and made the
385,00:27:08.12,00:27:08.12,"decision that it was too riskyto let him stay in the game,"
386,00:27:11.62,00:27:11.62,"because if the infection spread,it would become life-"
387,00:27:14.62,00:27:14.62,"threatening.They took him to the hospital,"
388,00:27:17.04,00:27:17.04,"performed surgery, opened up thewound, cleaned it out."
389,00:27:19.92,00:27:19.92,"He's doing fine.So we're now even, seven-seven,"
390,00:27:23.83,00:27:23.83,again.Game continues.
391,00:27:27.42,00:27:27.42,"Switching topics.Chet, Jason, did you guys have"
392,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,any time to look for the idolout on Exile?
393,00:27:34.17,00:27:34.17,">> Well, yeah, it was a longtime out there."
394,00:27:36.54,00:27:36.54,But I kind of gave up.And the conclusion I've come to
395,00:27:38.92,00:27:38.92,right now is that Ozzy hasalready discovered the hidden
396,00:27:41.75,00:27:41.75,"immunity idol.>> JEFF: Ozzy, interesting play"
397,00:27:44.54,00:27:44.54,going on.Only a few people have been to
398,00:27:47.04,00:27:47.04,"Exile, so only a few of youreally know the truth about"
399,00:27:50.12,00:27:50.12,what's happening out there.>> I don't know if he isn't that
400,00:27:54.08,00:27:54.08,"good at following clues, or ifsomeone else has found it."
401,00:27:57.38,00:27:57.38,I guess we're only going to findout in the next couple of days.
402,00:28:00.38,00:28:00.38,>> JEFF: All right.You guys ready to get to today's
403,00:28:03.71,00:28:03.71,immunity challenge?>> Yep.
404,00:28:05.96,00:28:05.96,">> JEFF: For today's challenge,both tribes will use stepping"
405,00:28:08.83,00:28:08.83,poles to transfer two tribemembers from one large platform
406,00:28:13.21,00:28:13.21,to another.All seven tribe members must
407,00:28:17.17,00:28:17.17,then swim out to a final verysmall tower.

411,00:28:32.17,00:28:32.17,Somebody going home.We are even at seven-seven.
412,00:28:34.75,00:28:34.75,Nobody sitting it out.I'll give you a chance to
413,00:28:36.79,00:28:36.79,strategize.We'll get started.
414,00:28:41.25,00:28:41.25,Here we go.For immunity.
415,00:28:44.08,00:28:44.08,Survivors ready?Go!
416,00:28:48.42,00:28:48.42,It's a big collision as you'vegot to switch lanes to begin.
417,00:28:51.88,00:28:51.88,"First step, untie the steppingpoles."
418,00:28:56.29,00:28:56.29,Tracy and Ami going to becarried across the water for

427,00:29:29.04,00:29:29.04,strategy.And it does.

429,00:29:34.62,00:29:34.62,Airai.Not the way this challenge was
430,00:29:38.17,00:29:38.17,designed or the way we thoughtit would go.
431,00:29:41.42,00:29:41.42,Airai going to try it again withParvati.
432,00:29:46.67,00:29:46.67,Can she keep her balance?Malakal sticking with their plan
433,00:29:52.12,00:29:52.12,of using both poles.They have not stolen Airai's
434,00:29:55.75,00:29:55.75,strategy.James is powering Airai to a
435,00:29:59.25,00:29:59.25,huge lead.Airai has-- oh!
436,00:30:05.33,00:30:05.33,Oh!It almost worked.
437,00:30:07.92,00:30:07.92,">> Wait, she didn't touch...>> No, you're down."
438,00:30:10.12,00:30:10.12,You're using the ladder.All the way to the back.
439,00:30:13.38,00:30:13.38,Airai was very close.Parvati fell off at the last
440,00:30:17.25,00:30:17.25,second.Got to go all the way back to
441,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,the start.Airai giving it another go.
442,00:30:29.25,00:30:29.25,"Parvati trying to balance again.Malakal taking a lot of time,"
443,00:30:35.67,00:30:35.67,making very little progress.Airai very close again.
444,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,Will it work?Parvati's across.
445,00:30:51.21,00:30:51.21,Eliza's across.Everybody to the platform.
446,00:30:58.12,00:30:58.12,Malakal still working on theirfirst tribe member as Airai
447,00:31:01.29,00:31:01.29,climbs up the final tower.You've got to get all seven

452,00:31:19.79,00:31:19.79,They're heading back to pick upAmi.

455,00:31:30.75,00:31:30.75,Immunity at stake.Malakal now using Airai's
456,00:31:36.12,00:31:36.12,strategy.Are they too late?
457,00:31:40.08,00:31:40.08,">> Okay, my foot's up.>> One, two, three."

461,00:32:05.62,00:32:05.62,Come on over and get immunity.Congratulations.
462,00:32:13.88,00:32:13.88,No tribal council for Airai.Safe in this game at least one
463,00:32:16.62,00:32:16.62,"more day.Malakal, tribal council tonight."
464,00:32:19.54,00:32:19.54,One of you going home.You have the afternoon to figure

469,00:32:57.17,00:32:57.17,>> Blazing glory.>> Yeah.
470,00:33:04.54,00:33:04.54,>> How are you feeling?>> A fish hook?

472,00:33:08.00,00:33:08.00,my foot.>> No!
473,00:33:09.54,00:33:09.54,">> Look at this.Isn't this, like, a pocket of"

475,00:33:13.04,00:33:13.04,here.>> That's what's hurt.
476,00:33:15.21,00:33:15.21,That's what it is.I just want to open it up and
477,00:33:17.04,00:33:17.04,get that out and the pain willbe gone.
478,00:33:18.96,00:33:18.96,">> Don't do that.>> You ready to go, huh?"
479,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,">> Oh, man.Damn."
480,00:33:30.08,00:33:30.08,"Losing everyone.What is going on, man?"
481,00:33:34.12,00:33:34.12,We lost the immunity challengeyet again.
482,00:33:37.67,00:33:37.67,"And all of a sudden, Chet comesup and says, ""Please do me a"
483,00:33:40.58,00:33:40.58,"favor and vote me out tonight.""I was like, ""All right, Chet,"
484,00:33:44.42,00:33:44.42,"we'll vote you out.""Was there any question anyways?"

488,00:34:08.62,00:34:08.62,">> Chet's injured, he's done.He wants to leave the game by"
489,00:34:11.25,00:34:11.25,"being voted out, because hethinks that's honorable."
490,00:34:13.67,00:34:13.67,"But I think it would be totallymore honorable to help Tracy,"
491,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,"his longtime friend since he'sbeen in this game, and myself to"
492,00:34:19.83,00:34:19.83,"get out, like, one of the biggerthreats right now."
493,00:34:22.79,00:34:22.79,We need him so bad just so wecan get Cirie out right now or
494,00:34:25.71,00:34:25.71,"Ozzy, even.>> What if Ozzy's got the idol?"
495,00:34:36.08,00:34:36.08,">> If Chet makes it all the wayuntil tribal and votes, it would"
496,00:34:38.38,00:34:38.38,be amazing.>> Chet and I are tight.
497,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,"And I understand he's sick, butit is imperative that Chet vote"
498,00:34:45.17,00:34:45.17,"with us today.If he doesn't, I'm screwed."
499,00:34:47.71,00:34:47.71,But I'm not going to put hisname down.
500,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,"I won't do it.>> You're just more than ready,"
501,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,"huh?>> Come on, guys."
502,00:35:04.92,00:35:04.92,I have too much going on rightnow.
503,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,And these last two days havebeen total hell.
504,00:35:08.46,00:35:08.46,"I can't even think straight.Please, that's all I'm asking."
505,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,">> You could help take Ozzydown, because he's not expecting"
506,00:35:14.75,00:35:14.75,it.This would be the craziest play
507,00:35:17.17,00:35:17.17,ever in the history of this gameif you helped us do this.
508,00:35:20.04,00:35:20.04,>> The target keeps changing.Now Erik and Tracy are looking
509,00:35:24.12,00:35:24.12,"at Ozzy, going, ""Ozzy might havethe idol, he's a threat."""
510,00:35:27.71,00:35:27.71,And I'm definitely going to haveto deal with Ozzy at some point.
511,00:35:30.42,00:35:30.42,So if Tracey and Erik convinceChet to stay in the game and
512,00:35:34.42,00:35:34.42,"make a vote, I would vote withthem."
513,00:35:42.29,00:35:42.29,">> I know.>> If you did this for us, it"
514,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,would be the biggest gift youcould give us on the way out to
515,00:35:46.25,00:35:46.25,just take a little pride.Me and Tracy would be so
516,00:35:49.04,00:35:49.04,grateful.We would be amazingly grateful
517,00:35:51.25,00:35:51.25,"for that, that you could useyour last dying breath to do"
518,00:35:55.04,00:35:55.04,something for us in this game.I would be incredibly grateful.
519,00:35:58.29,00:35:58.29,">> Just think about it, okay?>> I'll think about it."
520,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,Tracy and I committed to eachother from day one that we would
521,00:36:03.62,00:36:03.62,"do whatever we could for eachother, but I've been having some"
522,00:36:06.17,00:36:06.17,issues with my foot and someother health issues.
523,00:36:08.38,00:36:08.38,I pretty much told them I wouldtake the hit tonight.
524,00:36:11.00,00:36:11.00,But Tracy and Erik have anotherplan up their sleeve.
525,00:36:13.21,00:36:13.21,They want to use my vote to tryto take out Ozzy.
526,00:36:15.54,00:36:15.54,"I did tell Tracy and Erik Iwould think about it, and I will"
527,00:36:18.21,00:36:18.21,"think about it, but to behonest, I'm not sure what I'm"

540,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,"challenge, Jason made a commentafter going to Exile, basically"

544,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,put some thoughts in my head.And I wouldn't put it past Ozzy
545,00:37:34.42,00:37:34.42,that he found the idol.That's based on knowing Ozzy.

555,00:38:07.96,00:38:07.96,and so blindsided that I'll justget naked and jump off the pier
