4,00:00:14.50,00:00:14.50,"Jerri and Sandra into votingwith them, and whittled the"
5,00:00:17.21,00:00:17.21,Heroes down to only two members.>> Colby and I are standing out
6,00:00:20.67,00:00:20.67,on a sinking ship now.There are no other Heroes.
7,00:00:25.12,00:00:25.12,>> I trust you.>> PROBST: But Sandra had been
8,00:00:28.17,00:00:28.17,secretly working againstRussell's alliance.
9,00:00:29.83,00:00:29.83,>> You want Russell gone?>> Yeah.

15,00:00:44.04,00:00:44.04,...it was clear he was thenext to go.
16,00:00:46.42,00:00:46.42,But Russell saw Danielle andParvati growing too close
17,00:00:49.17,00:00:49.17,"for comfort...>> To me, they're a team, when"
18,00:00:51.38,00:00:51.38,it's supposed to be meand Parvati.
19,00:00:53.25,00:00:53.25,And that's a problem.The only thing I can think of
20,00:00:55.92,00:00:55.92,right now is to break upthat couple.
21,00:00:58.46,00:00:58.46,>> PROBST: ...so he targeted hisown alliance.
22,00:01:01.17,00:01:01.17,>> Danielle.>> Yeah.
23,00:01:02.25,00:01:02.25,>> PROBST: He secured votes fromthe Heroes and tried to get one

29,00:01:16.25,00:01:16.25,right now!>> PROBST: ...and let slip how
30,00:01:18.21,00:01:18.21,tight her alliance waswith Parvati.
31,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,>> I'm closer to Parvati thanyou think.
32,00:01:23.38,00:01:23.38,">> Oh, really?>> PROBST: So Russell gave the"
33,00:01:26.58,00:01:26.58,signal and brought his empirecrashing to the ground.
34,00:01:30.12,00:01:30.12,"Danielle, the tribe has spoken.Now everyone's left to"
35,00:01:34.29,00:01:34.29,scramble for new alliances.Six are left.
36,00:01:37.88,00:01:37.88,Who will be voted out tonight?>> It was a wonderful
37,00:01:56.04,00:01:56.04,Tribal Council onceagain for me.
38,00:01:59.33,00:01:59.33,"Every day, my chances ofwinning this game get better"
39,00:02:04.42,00:02:04.42,and better.>> Yeah.
40,00:02:25.29,00:02:25.29,">> I know. (sighs)>> I don't, I don't know."
41,00:02:34.00,00:02:34.00,>> I think Russell was jealousof my relationship with
42,00:02:37.29,00:02:37.29,"Danielle, and he wanted to makesure that it was him and I that"
43,00:02:41.29,00:02:41.29,were the closest two.Here he comes.
44,00:02:43.12,00:02:43.12,The move that Russell madetonight has made me completely
45,00:02:45.50,00:02:45.50,distrust him.Russell is the biggest villain
46,00:02:48.00,00:02:48.00,that this game has ever seen.But I still need to be nice to
47,00:02:53.00,00:02:53.00,"Russell, because I still needto get Colby and Rupert off"
48,00:02:57.04,00:02:57.04,"before anyone else.Then, I can deal with Russell"
49,00:03:00.54,00:03:00.54,after that.>> I believe the decision today
50,00:03:11.29,00:03:11.29,"saved my butt.When Danielle said, ""We're"
51,00:03:14.12,00:03:14.12,"""closer than you really think,Russell,"" the switch went off"
52,00:03:17.00,00:03:17.00,"in my head and I was, like,""Oh, really?"
53,00:03:22.08,00:03:22.08,"Did she just say that to me?"">> I don't know if I believe"
54,00:03:43.58,00:03:43.58,"Parvati any more.All of a sudden, she's worried"
55,00:03:45.96,00:03:45.96,she's next.That shows me that Parvati and
56,00:03:48.83,00:03:48.83,Danielle were a strong team.And I just got rid of her
57,00:03:52.29,00:03:52.29,"main alliance.Now, she has nobody to lean her"
58,00:03:55.21,00:03:55.21,head on but me.(theme music plays)

328,00:19:38.83,00:19:38.83,"She should have took a guy,because it would have made more"
329,00:19:42.04,00:19:42.04,sense strategically.Wow.
330,00:19:45.00,00:19:45.00,">> When Jerri got to announcewho she's gonna bring, I"
331,00:19:47.42,00:19:47.42,was fully expecting hertoo bring me.
332,00:19:49.38,00:19:49.38,Why wouldn't she?I been taking care of Jerri
333,00:19:52.92,00:19:52.92,this entire time.She's not gonna take me?
334,00:19:54.67,00:19:54.67,Is she gonna tell me she didit strategically?
335,00:19:58.12,00:19:58.12,She ain't played strategicallythis whole game.
336,00:19:59.96,00:19:59.96,And all of a sudden?Parvati would have done the
337,00:20:02.21,00:20:02.21,"same thing, not chose me.I saved Parvati's ass."
338,00:20:04.79,00:20:04.79,I saved Jerri's ass.I'm draggin' 'em through the

350,00:20:38.58,00:20:38.58,>> I'll do it.So Russell is hot and heavy on

352,00:20:47.54,00:20:47.54,>> I want you to trust me.>> A hundred percent.

356,00:21:01.08,00:21:01.08,I think that guarantees mea million dollars.
357,00:21:04.12,00:21:04.12,>> Final three...>> Do you think you have
358,00:21:07.12,00:21:07.12,"the ability, Russell,to get either, uh, Parvati or"
359,00:21:11.21,00:21:11.21,Jerri?>> I think Jerri.
360,00:21:13.17,00:21:13.17,I think I can get Jerri to goon our side.
361,00:21:15.50,00:21:15.50,">> I think you can, too.All we need her for is one vote."
362,00:21:18.42,00:21:18.42,">> And Parvati goes home.>> Oh, yes."

364,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,"can control her the most.And when she gets back, I'm"
365,00:21:27.75,00:21:27.75,gonna have to make sureshe's tight with me.
366,00:21:30.33,00:21:30.33,"I got to think about winningthis game, and Parvati is a"
367,00:21:33.79,00:21:33.79,huge threat for themillion dollars.
368,00:21:35.62,00:21:35.62,"She's the only one that cangive me a shot for it,"
369,00:21:38.42,00:21:38.42,in my mind.So now if Parvati doesn't win
370,00:21:41.29,00:21:41.29,"immunity, she's going home.We get rid of Parvati and we"
371,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,got to compete against who?We compete against Jerri
372,00:21:48.54,00:21:48.54,and Sandra?We in the top three.

382,00:23:08.54,00:23:08.54,"wood, snap twigs, break things,slam things on the ground."
383,00:23:12.75,00:23:12.75,"I'm talking, like, huge logs,dropping them on the ground."
384,00:23:16.38,00:23:16.38,The whole ground shakes.I have never in my life seen

386,00:23:25.46,00:23:25.46,incredible cockiness or justcomplete stupidity.
387,00:23:28.42,00:23:28.42,I'm leaning more towardsstupidity quite frankly.
388,00:23:32.33,00:23:32.33,"I want to kill Rupert right now.Honestly, I want him gone more"
389,00:23:37.00,00:23:37.00,than anything in the entireuniverse.

395,00:23:53.08,00:23:53.08,"But I mean, I was worried thatyou were gonna be mad."
396,00:23:56.00,00:23:56.00,"And both of them were, like,""No, ""he's gonna, he'll be fine,"
397,00:23:58.92,00:23:58.92,"he'll be fine.""And I was really worried."
398,00:24:00.75,00:24:00.75,">> No, I wasn't mad.I wasn't mad."
399,00:24:04.58,00:24:04.58,"You know, I wanted, I want youto know that whatever it takes"
