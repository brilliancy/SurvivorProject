442,00:35:35.40,00:35:35.40,ANGIE AND RUSS HAD PROBLEMS ON THE DIVING PORTION OF THE
443,00:35:37.97,00:35:37.97,CHALLENGE TODAY. IT SETTLES ON THEM HEAVIER THAN

447,00:35:51.63,00:35:51.63,MENTALITY NEEDS TO STOP. THE PEOPLE NEED TO STEP UP AND
448,00:35:54.97,00:35:54.97,THE REST OF THEM HAVE TO GO HOME.
449,00:35:57.80,00:35:57.80,">> ANGIE, ARE YOU CONCERNED IT MIGHT BE YOU TONIGHT?"
450,00:36:01.90,00:36:01.90,">> YES, I AM. I WAS SLOW."
451,00:36:03.53,00:36:03.53,BUT I WOULD HAVE DONE MY SECOND ONE.
452,00:36:05.40,00:36:05.40,I REALLY WOULD HAVE BUT SHE IS SUCH A BETTER DIVER THAN ME WHY
453,00:36:08.87,00:36:08.87,NOT LET HER DO IT AND GET IT DONE FASTER.
454,00:36:10.97,00:36:10.97,>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO VOTE YOU OUT TONIGHT FOR THAT?
455,00:36:14.77,00:36:14.77,>> I DON'T THINK SO. RUSSELL DID THE FIRST ONE.
456,00:36:17.00,00:36:17.00,HE COULDN'T GET UP ON THE LADDER.
457,00:36:18.97,00:36:18.97,"HIS SECOND TIME HE WENT IN, HE COMPLETELY GAVE UP."

465,00:36:44.97,00:36:44.97,ANGIE CAN'T HOLD A CANAL TO WHAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

475,00:37:23.27,00:37:23.27,YOU WENT IN THAT WATER TWO FEET. YOU WERE SLOW BECAUSE YOU DID
476,00:37:26.20,00:37:26.20,NOT HAVE THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH TO GET THAT RING OFF OF THERE.
477,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. THIS REVISIONIST HISTORY THING
478,00:37:34.40,00:37:34.40,"YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED ON THE PLATFORM, IT MAY"
479,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,WORK HERE FOR JEFF BUT ALL OF US WERE THERE.

484,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,I REALLY DON'T. >> I THINK EVERYBODY HERE IS
485,00:38:09.93,00:38:09.93,SAYING THEY DO BELIEVE YOU GAVE YOUR ALL.
486,00:38:11.77,00:38:11.77,I THINK WHAT RUSSELL IS SAYING IS YOU CAN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO
487,00:38:15.00,00:38:15.00,ME. >> IT'S HARD TO COMPETE WITH
488,00:38:16.97,00:38:16.97,HIM. IT HONESTLY IS.
489,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,LOOK AT HIM. >> BECAUSE THE SITUATION SHE IS
490,00:38:22.60,00:38:22.60,GETTING THRUST INTO A ROLE THAT WAS PROBABLY NEVER MEANT FOR
491,00:38:25.73,00:38:25.73,"HER, A STRENGTH ROLE. THERE ARE LITTLE GIRLS ON THE"
492,00:38:28.20,00:38:28.20,OTHER TRIBES THAT HAVEN'T HAD TO DO THE THINGS SHE HAS HAD TO DO
493,00:38:32.13,00:38:32.13,IN TWO CHALLENGES YET. SHE'S IN A TOUGHER SITUATION
494,00:38:35.40,00:38:35.40,THAN ANY OTHER YOUNG GIRL IS RIGHT NOW.
495,00:38:37.37,00:38:37.37,>> SO DENY THESE THIS IS A TOUGH VOTE.
496,00:38:40.60,00:38:40.60,THERE'S ONLY THE FOUR OF YOU. YOU HAD TO HAVE MADE SOME
497,00:38:44.30,00:38:44.30,"FRIENDSHIPS, PROBABLY ALLIANCES AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS STRENGTH"
498,00:38:46.70,00:38:46.70,THING BUT ALSO HAVE LOYALTY. WHAT IF THEY CLASH?
499,00:38:50.03,00:38:50.03,>> DEFINITELY YOU THINK OF LOYALTY.
500,00:38:52.30,00:38:52.30,ANY ALLIANCES YOU HAVE MADE YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THAT BECAUSE
501,00:38:55.43,00:38:55.43,WHEN THERE'S A MERGE YOU NEED THAT.
502,00:38:57.30,00:38:57.30,THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD LEAD MY VOTE MORE THAN
503,00:38:59.87,00:38:59.87,"ANYTHING IS THE LOYALTY. >> MALCOMB, HOW IMPORTANT IS"
504,00:39:04.27,00:39:04.27,LOYALTY IF YOU WANT TO WIN AND GET THE VOTES?
505,00:39:07.00,00:39:07.00,">> IF YOU WANT TO WIN AND GET THE VOTES, LOYALTY IS PARAMOUNT"
506,00:39:11.83,00:39:11.83,BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN WIN THE GAME.
507,00:39:14.70,00:39:14.70,SO TONIGHT'S VOTE IS A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN STRENGTH AND
508,00:39:17.40,00:39:17.40,"LOYALTY, WHICH ONE DO WE NEED TO GO WITH, AND THIS IS THE"
509,00:39:22.23,00:39:22.23,QUESTION. WE SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK
510,00:39:25.13,00:39:25.13,ABOUT ON DAY EIGHT. >> JEFF:  OK.
511,00:39:29.10,00:39:29.10,"IT'S TIME TO VOTE. RUSSELL, YOU'RE UP."
512,00:39:36.90,00:39:36.90,>> I'M SORRY I MADE YOU CRY. THAT'S THE WAY THIS GAME SEEMS
513,00:39:40.47,00:39:40.47,"TO BE PLAYING, AND I HAVE TO PLAY HARD OR GO HOME."
514,00:39:55.23,00:39:55.23,>> ONE THING ABOUT ME IS I NEVER GIVE UP.
515,00:40:10.93,00:40:10.93,>> I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES. >> IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN
516,00:40:23.57,00:40:23.57,IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO
517,00:40:25.93,00:40:25.93,DO SO. OK.
518,00:40:31.73,00:40:31.73,ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ THE ASKTION IS FINAL AND THE PERSON
519,00:40:34.33,00:40:34.33,VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
520,00:40:38.10,00:40:38.10,IMMEDIATELY. I WILL READ THE VOTES.
