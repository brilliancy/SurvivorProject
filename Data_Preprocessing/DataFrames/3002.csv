363,00:24:22.00,00:24:22.00,WILL STRUGGLING EARLY. NO COLLARS TAKING A LITTLE
364,00:24:25.53,00:24:25.53,LONGER OUT OF THE GATE. VERY SIMPLE PREMISE: FILL YOUR
365,00:24:30.87,00:24:30.87,BUCKET WITH WATER AND TRY TO GET BACK AS MUCH OF THAT WATER AS
366,00:24:34.83,00:24:34.83,YOU CAN BEFORE IT LEAKS OUT. >> YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR HANDS
367,00:24:38.60,00:24:38.60,DOWN. YOU'RE NOT COVERING THE HOLE.
368,00:24:40.10,00:24:40.10,RIGHT THERE. >> LIKE THAT?
369,00:24:43.43,00:24:43.43,>> YEAH. >> Jeff: JOE IS GOING TO SEND
370,00:24:46.30,00:24:46.30,NINA OUT AHEAD. COULD BE A VERY SMART STRATEGY
371,00:24:50.67,00:24:50.67,BY THE NO COLLARS IF IT PLAYS OFF.
372,00:24:54.73,00:24:54.73,"BLUE COLLARS COMING BACK. >> THAT'S IT, YOU GUYS."
373,00:24:57.33,00:24:57.33,"BRING IT DOWN, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK!"
374,00:24:59.07,00:24:59.07,>> Jeff: HERE COMES WHITE COLLAR.
375,00:25:01.63,00:25:01.63,NO COLLAR HEADING BACK. THE GOAL IS TEAMWORK.
376,00:25:05.40,00:25:05.40,"THE MORE HOLES YOU PLUG, THE MORE WATER YOU WILL HAVE TO DUMP"
377,00:25:08.73,00:25:08.73,"INTO YOUR BARREL, WHICH MEANS THE FEWER RUNS YOU WILL HAVE TO"
378,00:25:14.87,00:25:14.87,MAKE. WHITE COLLAR HAS THEIR FIRST
379,00:25:18.93,00:25:18.93,"BUCKET. NO COLLAR MOVING VERY SLOW, BUT"
380,00:25:22.03,00:25:22.03,THAT DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING IF THEY'RE PLUGGING THE HOLES.
381,00:25:26.60,00:25:26.60,>> MAKE SURE WE GET IT ALL IN. >> Jeff: NO COLLAR DUMPS HALF
382,00:25:30.73,00:25:30.73,THEIR WATER ON THE GROUND. HERE COMES BLUE COLLAR.
383,00:25:44.30,00:25:44.30,ONCE AGAIN NINA GOING OUT. DO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE REASON
384,00:25:48.20,00:25:48.20,WHY NINA IS NOT PART OF THIS. NO COLLAR ONCE AGAIN VERY SLOW
385,00:25:56.90,00:25:56.90,"AND DOING IT WITH ONLY FOUR TRIBE MEMBERS, EVEN THOUGH THEY"
386,00:26:00.23,00:26:00.23,HAVE FIVE. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS NOT
387,00:26:03.00,00:26:03.00,"WORKING, NO COLLARS. BLUE COLLAR BACK WITH ANOTHER"
388,00:26:06.70,00:26:06.70,BUCKET FULL OF WATER. WHITE COLLAR BACK WITH ANOTHER
389,00:26:09.00,00:26:09.00,BUCKET. HEADING BACK OUT.
390,00:26:18.57,00:26:18.57,FOR SOME REASON THAT MAKES SENSE NO COMERS TO HAVE NINA NOT
391,00:26:24.90,00:26:24.90,PARTICIPATE. HERE COMES BLUE COLLAR AGAIN.
392,00:26:29.23,00:26:29.23,>> YEAH! >> Jeff: HERE COMES WHITE

399,00:26:54.80,00:26:54.80,>> Jeff: COULD THIS BE ENOUGH? NO.
400,00:26:58.57,00:26:58.57,WHITE COLLAR HAS TO HEAD BACK OUT.
401,00:27:04.23,00:27:04.23,NOT ENOUGH FOR BLUE COLLAR. THEY HAVE TO HEAD BACK OUT.
402,00:27:06.93,00:27:06.93,IT IS VERY CLOSE BETWEEN BLUE AND WHITE.
403,00:27:09.87,00:27:09.87,">> THIS IS IT, YOU GUYS! THIS IS IT."
404,00:27:12.70,00:27:12.70,>> Jeff: EVERY BIT OF WATER YOU KEEP IN THAT BUCKET MAKES A
405,00:27:16.37,00:27:16.37,DIFFERENCE. NINA FINALLY HELPING OUT NOW FOR
406,00:27:18.63,00:27:18.63,THE FIRST TIME. >> A LITTLE FURTHER.

411,00:27:32.50,00:27:32.50,HOW MUCH WATER CAN THEY KEEP IN THE BUCKET?
412,00:27:43.33,00:27:43.33,NO COLLAR WITH ANOTHER BUCKET. NICE BUT NOT ENOUGH.
413,00:27:46.47,00:27:46.47,NO COLLAR HEADING BACK OUT. HERE COMES BLUE COLLAR.
414,00:27:50.17,00:27:50.17,COULD THIS BE FOR THE WIN? HERE COMES WHITE COLLAR.
415,00:27:54.43,00:27:54.43,">> GO, GO, GO! >> Jeff: YES!"

441,00:29:41.30,00:29:41.30,IT KICKED MY ASS. THE SAD FACT IS WE'RE GOING TO
442,00:29:45.30,00:29:45.30,"ANOTHER TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR NINA TO GO."
443,00:30:12.93,00:30:12.93,>> I JUST WANT TO SAY SORRY. I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY

452,00:30:39.60,00:30:39.60,RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE I KIND OF CAME UP WITH THE STRATEGY AND

454,00:30:46.83,00:30:46.83,"PARTICIPATE, AND I FEEL PRETTY BAD ABOUT IT."
455,00:30:48.57,00:30:48.57,BECAUSE I SCREWED HER OVER TODAY.
456,00:30:51.10,00:30:51.10,AND I KNOW NINA DOESN'T WANT TO TWO HOME.
457,00:30:53.60,00:30:53.60,"NO ONE WANTS TO GO HOME FROM THIS GAME, SO SHE WANTS THE"
458,00:30:56.40,00:30:56.40,"FIGHT, SHE'LL FIGHT. >> WELL, I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED"

463,00:31:10.03,00:31:10.03,I JUST FEEL BAD FOR ASSUMING THAT SHE WOULD SLOW US DOWN.
464,00:31:14.70,00:31:14.70,THAT'S NOT RIGHT. I FEEL TERRIBLE.
465,00:31:17.40,00:31:17.40,>> LIVE AND LEARN. >> WE BLEW IT AGAIN.
466,00:31:20.30,00:31:20.30,"WE TRIED TO MAKE NINA A NON-FACTOR, AND IT COST US."
467,00:31:26.40,00:31:26.40,"SO BACK TO TRIBAL COUNCIL WE GO. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, MAN."
468,00:31:31.80,00:31:31.80,"THIS IS THE GAME, DOG. WHAT ARE WE PLAYING?"

473,00:31:49.47,00:31:49.47,WHILE. OKAY.
474,00:31:57.30,00:31:57.30,>> ABSOLUTELY. >> HOW DO YOU THINK THE VOTE IS
475,00:32:03.90,00:32:03.90,GOING TO GO TONIGHT? >> I HAVE NO IDEA.
476,00:32:06.07,00:32:06.07,">> WHAT'S THAT? >> I SAID, I HAVE NO IDEA."
477,00:32:08.60,00:32:08.60,">> I THINK TONIGHT'S DEFINITELY BETWEEN ME AND WILL, BECAUSE THE"
478,00:32:12.60,00:32:12.60,"THREE THAT ARE IN CONTROL RIGHT NOW ARE JOE, JENN AND HALI, SO I"
479,00:32:17.70,00:32:17.70,NEED TO CONVINCE THEM TO VOTE WILL OVER ME.
480,00:32:23.37,00:32:23.37,>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO YOU WANT TO VOTE OUT TONIGHT?
481,00:32:27.37,00:32:27.37,>> ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE WILL? >> I COULD VOTE WILL.
482,00:32:34.63,00:32:34.63,>> THAT'S TWO CHALLENGES IN A ROW HE SUCKEDMENT ONE CHALLENGE
483,00:32:38.40,00:32:38.40,"DOESN'T MAKE ME GO NO, BUT TWO IT DOES."
484,00:32:40.47,00:32:40.47,>> NINA AND WILL ARE DEFINITELY ON BORROWED TIME.
485,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,WILL DID NOT PERFORM IN THE CHALLENGE.
486,00:32:44.43,00:32:44.43,IT WAS EMBARRASSING. BUT I STILL DON'T REALLY TRUST
487,00:32:47.20,00:32:47.20,"HIM AT ALL. HE SEEMS SNEAKY, BUT, YOU KNOW,"
488,00:32:51.07,00:32:51.07,"NINA, SHE'S A WET BLANKET ON THE ENTIRE TRIBE."
489,00:32:53.80,00:32:53.80,I THINK WILL AND NINA SUCK EQUALLY IN CHALLENGES.
490,00:32:57.13,00:32:57.13,">> I DO, TOO. WILL SUCKS."
491,00:32:59.37,00:32:59.37,">> WELL, IT TOOK LONGER FOR WILL TO SWIM TO THE BOAT THE OTHER"

493,00:33:05.83,00:33:05.83,I THOUGHT WILL WAS DYING. >> NINA IS JUST SO FRAIL AND HER
494,00:33:09.70,00:33:09.70,"ATTITUDE IS NOT THERE, BUT WILL IS STRUGGLING LIKE HARD CORE."
495,00:33:13.07,00:33:13.07,>> WHAT IF ME AND YOU VOTE WILL? WILL VOTED FOR THE WRONG PERSON
496,00:33:18.87,00:33:18.87,"LAST TRIBAL. AND NOW, YOU KNOW, I DON'T TRUST"
497,00:33:20.93,00:33:20.93,HIM. I THINK HE'S A SNAKE.
498,00:33:22.30,00:33:22.30,SO MY BIGGEST FEAR MOVING FORWARD IS THAT WILL MIGHT DO
499,00:33:27.13,00:33:27.13,SOMETHING IDIOTIC AND THAT JENN AND I WILL HAVE TROUBLE AT THE
500,00:33:32.30,00:33:32.30,MERGE. SO WE'RE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A
501,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,"HARD PLACE RIGHT NOW, WHO IS GOING TO GO HOME, WILL IT BE"
502,00:33:38.47,00:33:38.47,WILL OR NINA? >> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
503,00:34:02.80,00:34:02.80,SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.
504,00:34:04.60,00:34:04.60,"IT SEEMED TO CENTER AROUND TRUST, AND IT RESULTED IN WHAT"
505,00:34:07.40,00:34:07.40,"APPEARED TO BE A BLIND SIDE ON VINCE, BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM AS"
506,00:34:09.97,00:34:09.97,THOUGH VINCE WAS THE ONLY ONE SURPRISED BY THE OUTCOME.
507,00:34:12.70,00:34:12.70,"WILL, WHEN YOU GUYS GOT BACK TO CAMP, WAS THERE SOMETHING TO"
508,00:34:15.37,00:34:15.37,"CLEAR UP? >> YEAH, PRETTY MUCH."
509,00:34:18.17,00:34:18.17,"I HAD TO GO WITH SOMEBODY I TRUSTED, AND THAT'S WHY I VOTED"
510,00:34:22.03,00:34:22.03,"HIM OUT. >> Jeff: JOE, IT'S INTERESTING"
511,00:34:25.17,00:34:25.17,"THAT THIS GAME PLAYS ON SO MANY LEVELS, BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL IN"
512,00:34:29.10,00:34:29.10,"THE TRIBE PORTION OF THE GAME, AND YET YOU'RE ALREADY PLAYING"
513,00:34:31.53,00:34:31.53,THE INDIVIDUAL PART OF THE GAME. AND THE TRUST ISSUES COULD COME
514,00:34:34.77,00:34:34.77,BACK IF YOUR TRIBE REMAINS INTACT.
515,00:34:36.63,00:34:36.63,">> OH, ABSOLUTELY. YOU ONLY GET A COUPLE"
516,00:34:40.20,00:34:40.20,"OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU MAKE MISTAKES TO FIX THOSE MISTAKES,"
517,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,"SO, YEAH, IT'S A HUGE FACTOR TO TRUST PEOPLE AND TRY TO KEEP"
518,00:34:49.47,00:34:49.47,YOUR ALLIANCES AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE GOING INTO THE FUTURE.
519,00:34:52.63,00:34:52.63,>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE.
520,00:34:54.77,00:34:54.77,YOUR STRATEGY TO PULL NINA OUT OF THIS CHALLENGE WAS HARD TO
521,00:34:58.97,00:34:58.97,"UNDERSTAND. JOE, WHAT WAS THE THINKING?"
522,00:35:01.10,00:35:01.10,">> WELL, YOU KNOW, FIVE PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THAT LADDER WAS A"
523,00:35:04.57,00:35:04.57,"LITTLE TRICKY, SO I WAS THINKING THAT NINA COULD STUMBLE AND FALL"
524,00:35:07.97,00:35:07.97,"AND TAKE THE WHOLE THING DOWN, SO, YEAH, I KIND OF MESSED UP"
525,00:35:12.23,00:35:12.23,"TODAY BIG TIME. >> Jeff: AND YET, NINA, WHAT"
526,00:35:16.07,00:35:16.07,YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH IN YOU TO LET
527,00:35:19.20,00:35:19.20,"YOU PLAY. >> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS,"
528,00:35:21.87,00:35:21.87,"AND IT REALLY SHOWED ME THAT BECAUSE OF MY DISADVANTAGE, THEY"
529,00:35:26.83,00:35:26.83,HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FAITH THAT I CAN DO ANYTHING.
530,00:35:30.83,00:35:30.83,>> Jeff: BUT TODAY'S CHALLENGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HEARING.
531,00:35:33.07,00:35:33.07,>> I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY LOOK AT ME AS A WHOLE PERSON THAT HAS A
532,00:35:38.20,00:35:38.20,"DISADVANTAGE, WHETHER IT'S MY EARS, MY FEET OR WHATEVER IT IS."
533,00:35:41.37,00:35:41.37,>> Jeff: BECAUSE YOU'RE DEAF? >> YES.
534,00:35:44.53,00:35:44.53,>> >> I'LL DISAGREE WITH THAT.
535,00:35:47.47,00:35:47.47,NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES WE PULL NINA TO THE SIDE TO GIVE HER A
536,00:35:50.57,00:35:50.57,"PEP TALK, BOOST HER MORALE, IT ALWAYS GOES BACK TO HER BEING"
537,00:35:54.20,00:35:54.20,"DEAF, SO THAT'S WHAT IS MAKING ME UPSET BECAUSE WE TRY."
