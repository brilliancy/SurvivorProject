1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Galu making a
2,00:00:02.17,00:00:02.17,big move now on their puzzle. Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:04.38,00:00:04.38,"Galu wins immunity! Since the start of the game,"
4,00:00:08.12,00:00:08.12,"Galu has won almost every challenge, and they seem"
5,00:00:10.50,00:00:10.50,"invincible, but cracks are starting to show."
6,00:00:13.17,00:00:13.17,The four guys formed an alliance and ticked off the
7,00:00:16.62,00:00:16.62,women by electing Shambo their leader.
8,00:00:18.67,00:00:18.67,>> I thought the way to elect the new leader was stupid.
9,00:00:21.12,00:00:21.12,>> PROBST: And there's a feud brewing between Shambo and
10,00:00:23.04,00:00:23.04,"Laura. >> Clearly, she doesn't like me."
11,00:00:25.50,00:00:25.50,">> PROBST: On day 16, Galu won yet another reward challenge."
12,00:00:29.38,00:00:29.38,Galu wins reward! So Shambo stuck it to Laura by
13,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,sending her to Foa Foa for a short visit...
14,00:00:36.67,00:00:36.67,>> All the way. >> PROBST: ...and denying her a
15,00:00:39.25,00:00:39.25,once-in-a-lifetime reward. >> I think it was her own little
16,00:00:42.17,00:00:42.17,"way of saying, ""I'm leader now, and what I say goes."""
17,00:00:45.12,00:00:45.12,">> PROBST: At Foa Foa, Russell and Natalie immediately pounced"
18,00:00:48.12,00:00:48.12,on Laura. >> Natalie's doing a good job
19,00:00:50.58,00:00:50.58,talking to Laura around the camp.
20,00:00:52.62,00:00:52.62,"If we merge, we need somebody on the inside."
21,00:00:54.75,00:00:54.75,>> PROBST: When Foa Foa lost another immunity challenge...
22,00:00:57.83,00:00:57.83,"Galu wins immunity! ... they went to Tribal Council,"
23,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,and Russell made good on his threat to knock out Liz.
24,00:01:04.21,00:01:04.21,>> You're the weakest link when it comes to trust.
25,00:01:07.12,00:01:07.12,">> PROBST: Liz, the tribe has spoken."
26,00:01:09.25,00:01:09.25,"Outnumbered eight to four, Foa Foa now needs a miracle in"
27,00:01:13.88,00:01:13.88,order to survive. 12 are left.
28,00:01:15.96,00:01:15.96,Who will be voted out tonight? >> So tomorrow if we got to go
29,00:01:29.50,00:01:29.50,"get it... As a tribe, we're down to four"
30,00:01:32.29,00:01:32.29,"people, so we're in a horribly inferior position to the Galu"
31,00:01:36.08,00:01:36.08,"tribe, and so it makes our job even more difficult, 'cause we"
32,00:01:38.96,00:01:38.96,got to try to struggle to get to a merge and then try and divide
33,00:01:42.58,00:01:42.58,"and conquer. Otherwise, we're all screwed."
34,00:01:44.75,00:01:44.75,">> What is that, 12 people left? >> So it's a possibility the"
35,00:01:48.12,00:01:48.12,"next thing is a merge. Yeah, when we get over there,"
36,00:01:50.21,00:01:50.21,"dude, the game on. >> Game on."
37,00:01:52.21,00:01:52.21,>> The game starts. If we all stick together and all
38,00:01:54.96,00:01:54.96,"talk to somebody different, man, at least one of them's going to"
39,00:01:57.58,00:01:57.58,work for us. >> Yeah.
40,00:01:59.58,00:01:59.58,>> You know? Foa Foa needs a merge.
41,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,We have some strong ideas once we get over there.
42,00:02:04.88,00:02:04.88,"We plan on working as a team, talking to different people."
43,00:02:16.12,00:02:16.12,>> There's segregation in their tribe.
44,00:02:19.33,00:02:19.33,"In our tribe, Foa Foa, there's unity."
45,00:02:22.12,00:02:22.12,"We're all working as a team, so I'm not really nervous about my"
46,00:02:25.25,00:02:25.25,numbers. I'm too good for this game.
47,00:02:28.21,00:02:28.21,"I'm too sly, and now I've got to make sure my seed is planted in"
48,00:02:33.21,00:02:33.21,"all of these dumb asses' heads. So once we do merge, we can stir"
49,00:02:37.67,00:02:37.67,them up over there. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
50,00:03:53.04,00:03:53.04,">> Since my return from the Foa Foa tribe, seems like"
51,00:03:56.46,00:03:56.46,there's definitely a lot of tension.
52,00:03:58.88,00:03:58.88,"I mean, clearly, Shambo doesn't like me in camp."
53,00:04:01.46,00:04:01.46,And that was a huge reason why I got sent over to the Foa Foa
54,00:04:04.54,00:04:04.54,"tribe. >> Yeah, that makes nine, and"
55,00:04:08.21,00:04:08.21,"that means there's one somewhere, because I brought it"
56,00:04:10.08,00:04:10.08,back. Do you want to take my canteen
57,00:04:12.88,00:04:12.88,until we find it? >> I have no reason to lie to
58,00:04:20.71,00:04:20.71,anybody. >> I wasn't accusing you of
59,00:04:22.67,00:04:22.67,lying. I was just asking where the
60,00:04:24.46,00:04:24.46,"canteen was. >> Laura, for two or three days,"
61,00:04:26.46,00:04:26.46,you've been coming at me. If you want to take a walk with
62,00:04:28.21,00:04:28.21,"me so we can sort things out, I'm good with that, but if you"
63,00:04:29.79,00:04:29.79,"don't, it's okay. >> I don't need to work"
64,00:04:31.79,00:04:31.79,anything out. I don't know what's going on
65,00:04:33.67,00:04:33.67,with me and Shambo. When I got sent over to the
66,00:04:35.67,00:04:35.67,"other tribe, Dave handed her my canteen."
67,00:04:37.83,00:04:37.83,"I didn't care. But when I came back to camp, I"
68,00:04:40.83,00:04:40.83,"said, ""Where is it?"" And then, she makes this huge,"
69,00:04:42.88,00:04:42.88,"big deal, and then, all of a sudden, brings up all these"
70,00:04:45.25,00:04:45.25,other things that I have no idea what she's even talking about.
71,00:04:47.79,00:04:47.79,">> There's some, like, little power struggle going on between"
72,00:04:49.88,00:04:49.88,"you and I, and I don't get it. I don't understand it."
73,00:04:52.46,00:04:52.46,I don't like it. It's like there's this 90210
74,00:04:57.04,00:04:57.04,"little young thing in you going on, and, uh, it-it's just..."
75,00:05:02.21,00:05:02.21,"it's bizarre to me. >> Now, how you perceive that,"
76,00:05:04.88,00:05:04.88,"if your feelings get hurt, and if you're, like, ""Well, what's"
77,00:05:07.21,00:05:07.21,"her problem?,"" well, that's on you."
78,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,>> It wasn't a fight about canteens.
79,00:05:11.08,00:05:11.08,It really is the way that she treats me on a regular basis.
80,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17,It's almost like those popular girls in high school that are
81,00:05:18.50,00:05:18.50,cheerleaders that want to snob their nose at people that don't
82,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,fit into their circle. I'm done with her.
83,00:05:25.75,00:05:25.75,"I have no use for her, none. >> You have a way of turning"
84,00:05:28.54,00:05:28.54,"things about, so, like, now I look like the bad person, like I"
85,00:05:31.04,00:05:31.04,"blew this whole thing up, like, ""Where is my canteen?"
86,00:05:33.25,00:05:33.25,"Where is my canteen?"" >> They're totally arguing over"
87,00:05:38.67,00:05:38.67,"nothing, absolutely nothing. Totally pissed off at nothing."
88,00:05:40.83,00:05:40.83,"Fantastic. >> So my feeling is, so now I"
89,00:05:43.75,00:05:43.75,have to suffer. I'm without a canteen.
90,00:05:45.75,00:05:45.75,">> To be honest, we know Shambo's crazy, so if you get"
91,00:05:48.25,00:05:48.25,"in a fight with Shambo, who's the one who looks bad?"
92,00:05:51.50,00:05:51.50,"You look bad. You fight with Shambo, that"
93,00:05:53.54,00:05:53.54,"means you're just as crazy as her, only you're not really"
94,00:05:55.92,00:05:55.92,crazy. You're just being a bitch.
95,00:06:08.67,00:06:08.67,">> ""It's time to follow your leader."
96,00:06:10.79,00:06:10.79,Face to face with your rivals once more.
97,00:06:13.25,00:06:13.25,"With your bodies pumped, and your minds sharp, your taste"
98,00:06:15.83,00:06:15.83,"buds and stomachs can score."" Oh, that would be awesome."
99,00:06:19.04,00:06:19.04,">> Sooner or later, something has to change for us."
100,00:06:22.08,00:06:22.08,I'm hoping today is the day. We're not super confident in our
101,00:06:26.38,00:06:26.38,"ability to win challenges anymore, uh, but we just don't"
102,00:06:28.38,00:06:28.38,"want to lose any more immunity challenges, 'cause the four that"
103,00:06:30.75,00:06:30.75,we have is the four we want to go into a merge with.
104,00:06:33.38,00:06:33.38,"They're the people that we think can really, really help us out"
105,00:06:36.67,00:06:36.67,when we get there. >> We got tree mail.
106,00:06:41.08,00:06:41.08,"It's so vague, we don't really know what it really means."
107,00:06:44.29,00:06:44.29,"I mean, it doesn't sound like the merge, but I'm pretty"
108,00:06:47.12,00:06:47.12,"confident it is about to happen, so I have to take my immunity"
109,00:06:50.08,00:06:50.08,"idol everywhere I go. We only have four people now,"
110,00:06:53.79,00:06:53.79,"but we have such a tight group, so it's not over."
111,00:06:59.04,00:06:59.04,There's so much more to this game than playing a physical
112,00:07:02.29,00:07:02.29,game with somebody. You have to be able to outwit
113,00:07:04.88,00:07:04.88,them. That's the most important thing
114,00:07:07.17,00:07:07.17,of the whole game. >> We were going to the
115,00:07:18.25,00:07:18.25,"challenge. We were walking down the beach,"
116,00:07:20.54,00:07:20.54,"the other tribe's coming down the beach towards us, and we're"
117,00:07:23.46,00:07:23.46,"meeting at this treasure chest. And Jeff isn't around, so"
118,00:07:27.17,00:07:27.17,"everyone's kind of on edge, not really sure what's happening."
119,00:07:29.62,00:07:29.62,(overlapping chatter) (whoops)
120,00:07:38.04,00:07:38.04,>> Nice! >> I'm so excited.
121,00:07:40.08,00:07:40.08,">> ""Congratulations, Foa Foa and Galu."
122,00:07:42.08,00:07:42.08,"You are now one tribe."" (applause and cheering)"
123,00:07:44.12,00:07:44.12,(laughter) Good job.
124,00:07:46.12,00:07:46.12,">> New buffs for everyone! >> ""You will all go back to live"
125,00:07:50.67,00:07:50.67,at the old Galu camp. Take some time to get to know
126,00:07:53.04,00:07:53.04,your new tribe mates. A feast awaits you down the
127,00:07:55.33,00:07:55.33,"beach."" (screams, cheers and chatter)"
128,00:07:57.33,00:07:57.33,I can't even tell you the sense of relief that I felt reading
129,00:08:01.42,00:08:01.42,that it was the merge. I no sooner got those words out
130,00:08:04.08,00:08:04.08,of my mouth that I just knew it was going to be a hell of a
131,00:08:07.21,00:08:07.21,good day. (screaming)
132,00:08:09.21,00:08:09.21,">> Oh, my God. >> Oh... my... God."
133,00:08:11.21,00:08:11.21,"(screaming, overlapping chatter) >> I'm actually really, really,"
134,00:08:19.08,00:08:19.08,"really happy that we merged, and the feast was delicious."
135,00:08:24.08,00:08:24.08,"There was chicken, all seasoned and roasted."
136,00:08:27.67,00:08:27.67,There were cheeses and fruits. >> Look at the size of these
137,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,grapes! >> Oh!
138,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,">> Mmm! >> It was, like, literally a"
139,00:08:35.25,00:08:35.25,feast fit for royalty. >> To our new tribe.
140,00:08:38.25,00:08:38.25,>> To our new tribe! (whooping and chatter)
141,00:08:41.21,00:08:41.21,>> To Samoa. >> Cheers!
142,00:08:44.83,00:08:44.83,">> Galu-Foa Foa merge. I am on top of the world, man."
143,00:08:48.42,00:08:48.42,"I'm in heaven right now. You guys, these are lemon"
144,00:08:51.46,00:08:51.46,meringue mini pies. >> This is what we've all been
145,00:08:53.75,00:08:53.75,talking about. >> I am on such a sugar high
146,00:08:56.04,00:08:56.04,"right now, I'm, like, ""My prayers were answered totally."""
147,00:09:05.08,00:09:05.08,">> Uh, yeah. Got a mechanical engineering"
148,00:09:07.12,00:09:07.12,degree. >> Congratulations.
149,00:09:09.21,00:09:09.21,">> Like, at first, I thought ""These hermit crabs are great,"""
150,00:09:11.75,00:09:11.75,"but after about seven or eight days, I'm, like, ""I never want"
151,00:09:14.12,00:09:14.12,"to eat another one of these things."""
152,00:09:16.42,00:09:16.42,You know what I mean? >> Russell is the best crab
153,00:09:18.96,00:09:18.96,"catcher, though. >> Things are about to change"
154,00:09:21.04,00:09:21.04,totally in this game. The other tribe-- I don't think
155,00:09:24.25,00:09:24.25,"they even realize it right now. >> I'm not bad, right?"
156,00:09:26.29,00:09:26.29,I'm not overbearing? >> I'm looking around at Foa Foa
157,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,when everybody is taking that step to do exactly what we said
158,00:09:31.25,00:09:31.25,in camp. >> I'm a good snuggler.
159,00:09:33.25,00:09:33.25,">> Get with these people, bring them under your wing and connect"
160,00:09:35.25,00:09:35.25,with them. >> It was a good day.
161,00:09:37.04,00:09:37.04,>> We're steps ahead of them. We already have our plan down.
162,00:09:40.38,00:09:40.38,>> Cheers. (laughing)
163,00:09:42.38,00:09:42.38,>> The ones I know I can trust-- they're doing exactly like I
164,00:09:45.04,00:09:45.04,"want them to do, and it's going to get stronger as we go along."
165,00:09:51.21,00:09:51.21,>> I can already see that I'm the ruler in this kingdom.
166,00:09:53.42,00:09:53.42,">> Got it? >> I mean, come on."
167,00:09:55.42,00:09:55.42,Who gets grapes fed to them? The kings do.
168,00:10:15.08,00:10:15.08,">> This is it! >> Our new home, buddy."
169,00:10:17.08,00:10:17.08,">> Welcome, you guys. >> Thanks for having me."
170,00:10:19.08,00:10:19.08,">> Do y'all have a certain place for bags, and....?"
171,00:10:21.08,00:10:21.08,">> Now we got some more body warmth, too."
172,00:10:23.08,00:10:23.08,>> That's our kitchen. >> Oh.
173,00:10:25.08,00:10:25.08,">> This is what we call the cutting board, or the kitchen"
174,00:10:27.08,00:10:27.08,"sink. >> Y'all are, like..."
175,00:10:29.08,00:10:29.08,The Galu camp-- I love it. It's awesome.
176,00:10:31.08,00:10:31.08,"I feel like I'm at the Hilton. You know, at Foa Foa, we had"
177,00:10:33.46,00:10:33.46,"absolutely nothing. Here at Galu, there's blankets,"
178,00:10:37.33,00:10:37.33,pillows. Everybody-- it really seems
179,00:10:39.67,00:10:39.67,like a family. >> I'll show you where our
180,00:10:41.67,00:10:41.67,water and stuff is. >> Okay.
181,00:10:43.67,00:10:43.67,Laura kind of took me under her wing.
182,00:10:45.67,00:10:45.67,"She was kind of like mother hen, showing me around, and it was"
183,00:10:49.04,00:10:49.04,"really nice, because it was really important for me to talk"
184,00:10:52.21,00:10:52.21,to Laura to find cracks in this group.
185,00:10:54.88,00:10:54.88,"Make no mistake, there are cracks."
186,00:10:56.96,00:10:56.96,"It's just, are there enough cracks and big enough cracks to"
187,00:10:59.67,00:10:59.67,get the numbers on our side? >> We got to pick a name.
188,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas?
189,00:11:04.83,00:11:04.83,>> Slow-mo? >> Does anybody have any funny
190,00:11:07.25,00:11:07.25,"Samoan slang? >> Aiga is, uh, Samoan for"
191,00:11:09.29,00:11:09.29,extended family. >> Cool!
192,00:11:11.58,00:11:11.58,>> What is it? Aiga? >> Aiga.
193,00:11:13.58,00:11:13.58,>> Aiga. >> That sounds good to me.
194,00:11:15.62,00:11:15.62,">> I like Aiga. >> All in favor of Aiga, say"
195,00:11:17.62,00:11:17.62,aye. >> Aiga.
196,00:11:19.62,00:11:19.62,>> Aiga. >> Aiga.
197,00:11:21.62,00:11:21.62,>> Aiga it is. >> That's it.
198,00:11:25.62,00:11:25.62,">> No, I like it. >> That's all I get."
199,00:11:27.62,00:11:27.62,>> Foa Foa-- the only thing that they have going for them is they
200,00:11:29.92,00:11:29.92,"have a new beach, and they have new people to talk to."
201,00:11:32.25,00:11:32.25,They're starting over. They're on day two.
202,00:11:34.25,00:11:34.25,I'm on day 19. I have the hidden immunity idol.
203,00:11:36.58,00:11:36.58,It's in my pocket. And that's power in this game.
204,00:11:39.08,00:11:39.08,And they think that they're going to strategize and make
205,00:11:41.29,00:11:41.29,"friends, and la-la-la, we're an extended family."
206,00:11:44.21,00:11:44.21,"Like, the name of our tribe, Aiga, means extended family."
207,00:11:46.25,00:11:46.25,Ugh! (laughter)
208,00:11:49.75,00:11:49.75,"Extended family? What's Samoan for ""Get the hell"
209,00:11:52.04,00:11:52.04,"off my island?"" >> I definitely have tricks up"
210,00:12:05.71,00:12:05.71,"my sleeve. Day one at Foa Foa, I was very"
211,00:12:08.29,00:12:08.29,aggressive. I went to everybody right off
212,00:12:10.67,00:12:10.67,"the bat, and my plan happened. It happened like I wanted to."
213,00:12:14.62,00:12:14.62,"Over here, I'm going to go to people, saying the same things,"
214,00:12:17.71,00:12:17.71,"doing exactly the same strategy, but I have the idol to be able"
215,00:12:21.29,00:12:21.29,"to make them sway my way. >> Obviously, I didn't find this"
216,00:12:26.46,00:12:26.46,on the beach. It's the real deal.
217,00:12:31.17,00:12:31.17,"Now, if you could take me to the top seven, I'll hand it to you."
218,00:12:39.08,00:12:39.08,I'll give it to you. I swear I will.
219,00:12:41.42,00:12:41.42,>> Okay. >> Nobody.
220,00:12:46.62,00:12:46.62,Everything's between me and you. >> Okay. So top seven?
221,00:12:48.67,00:12:48.67,">> Top seven, I'll hand it to you."
222,00:12:51.00,00:12:51.00,>> I can't believe Russell showed me he had the idol.
223,00:12:53.00,00:12:53.00,But you know what? Desperate people do desperate
224,00:12:55.00,00:12:55.00,things. I don't believe he would give
225,00:12:57.00,00:12:57.00,"that to me, but just knowing that he has it is huge, which"
226,00:12:59.04,00:12:59.04,"means when we do get rid of him, it's going to have to be a"
227,00:13:02.12,00:13:02.12,big blindside. >> There's a few rules that I
228,00:13:05.17,00:13:05.17,want to put in place with this deal.
229,00:13:07.71,00:13:07.71,"You can get rid of my guys whenever you want, but the first"
230,00:13:10.58,00:13:10.58,one to go has to be one of your guys.
231,00:13:13.88,00:13:13.88,>> That won't happen. >> You don't think?
232,00:13:15.88,00:13:15.88,>> That won't happen. >> Who do you want the first one
233,00:13:18.17,00:13:18.17,"to go, one of my guys? >> It'll be one of your guys or"
234,00:13:20.17,00:13:20.17,Shambo. >> Right.
235,00:13:22.17,00:13:22.17,>> It's kind of funny. Russell came to me with this
236,00:13:24.17,00:13:24.17,"attitude of, like... ""I'm the boss, and here's some"
237,00:13:26.46,00:13:26.46,"rules,"" he tells me. And I'm, like, ""Okay, well, just"
238,00:13:29.67,00:13:29.67,"so you know, I kind of hold all the cards right now, and, um,"
239,00:13:32.58,00:13:32.58,"you just need to try and stay alive."""
240,00:13:35.17,00:13:35.17,You're in a worse position than myself at this point.
241,00:13:37.42,00:13:37.42,You're coming here with ten percent.
242,00:13:39.46,00:13:39.46,I got 90. >> Right.
243,00:13:41.46,00:13:41.46,"Laura's digging her own grave. She told me, ""I'm 90% in charge"
244,00:13:44.62,00:13:44.62,"of this, Russell. You're about ten percent right"
245,00:13:46.67,00:13:46.67,"now."" In other words, sit down and"
246,00:13:48.96,00:13:48.96,listen. No.
247,00:13:50.96,00:13:50.96,It don't work like that for me. Okay.
248,00:13:53.46,00:13:53.46,"She might be the first to go. All right, well, I'm just going"
249,00:13:56.21,00:13:56.21,"to try to win them all, then. (Laura laughs)"
250,00:13:58.58,00:13:58.58,What else can I do? I went to Laura.
251,00:14:00.75,00:14:00.75,"I thought it wasn't going to really work, so I'm going to do"
252,00:14:04.00,00:14:04.00,the same thing with somebody else.
253,00:14:06.04,00:14:06.04,"Maybe, uh... uh... Monica."
254,00:14:31.62,00:14:31.62,>> ...I would give this to you and let you use it.
255,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,>> I'm in. >> Okay.
256,00:14:36.25,00:14:36.25,This has to stay between me and you...
257,00:14:38.67,00:14:38.67,>> Absolutely. >> ...or this won't work.
258,00:14:40.67,00:14:40.67,Monica didn't mean a word she said over there on the rocks.
259,00:14:43.96,00:14:43.96,"I see it in her eyes, but she might actually start meaning"
260,00:14:48.25,00:14:48.25,what she tells me if I get rid of her boss.
261,00:14:51.00,00:14:51.00,"I get rid of Laura, she comes a-runnin'."
262,00:14:53.33,00:14:53.33,"Now, if we can get one of the guys on my side, that would be"
263,00:14:56.21,00:14:56.21,gold. I'll get rid of Laura one way
264,00:14:58.88,00:14:58.88,or the other. >> That's crazy.
265,00:15:08.38,00:15:08.38,">> I got it with no clue. >> That is impressive, bro."
266,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,">> I'm telling you, dude, we can be in control of this game"
267,00:15:15.92,00:15:15.92,without them even knowing. I can convince my people to vote
268,00:15:17.92,00:15:17.92,whoever I say. I know you can do the same.
269,00:15:20.04,00:15:20.04,">> Mm-hmm. Right. >> Dude, I swear, if I think"
270,00:15:22.08,00:15:22.08,"your butt's on the line, I don't have a problem giving it to you,"
271,00:15:25.08,00:15:25.08,and letting you use it. >> And then we'll keep driving
272,00:15:27.12,00:15:27.12,"it, yeah. >> You're the only one here that"
273,00:15:32.25,00:15:32.25,can do it with me. I see that.
274,00:15:35.25,00:15:35.25,>> Russell divulged to me that he had the hidden immunity idol.
275,00:15:38.54,00:15:38.54,"I think because Russell's an aggressive player, and he"
276,00:15:41.12,00:15:41.12,realizes that maybe having a relationship with someone like
277,00:15:43.92,00:15:43.92,"me is something that could be very, very beneficial to him in"
278,00:15:46.25,00:15:46.25,this game. >> Do you think Laura is
279,00:15:48.29,00:15:48.29,trustworthy? >> What do you think?
280,00:15:50.25,00:15:50.25,">> I think she should go first, 'cause once she's gone, the girl"
281,00:15:53.46,00:15:53.46,power is over. >> Yeah.
282,00:15:55.46,00:15:55.46,Laura and Monica have a relationship that is potentially
283,00:15:58.08,00:15:58.08,dangerous. And even though it's going to be
284,00:16:01.38,00:16:01.38,"viewed as a big move, I think it's a manageable risk to vote"
285,00:16:04.25,00:16:04.25,"off Laura first, while we have votes from the other tribe."
286,00:16:07.71,00:16:07.71,>> My guys are going to vote Laura.
287,00:16:10.00,00:16:10.00,Right. >> Then I'll go get some
288,00:16:12.04,00:16:12.04,"cavalry. That's crazy, bro."
289,00:16:14.04,00:16:14.04,>> And then it could be me and you at the end.
290,00:16:16.04,00:16:16.04,>> That is crazy. >> Me and John could be a good
291,00:16:18.67,00:16:18.67,"team, I believe. He's smart enough to know what's"
292,00:16:22.46,00:16:22.46,"going on, so things are going to get crazy tomorrow out here."
293,00:16:29.96,00:16:29.96,>> All right. >> We're going to turn this game
294,00:16:32.00,00:16:32.00,on its side. >> Hey.
295,00:16:33.71,00:16:33.71,>> Shake your hand as a man. >> Absolutely.
296,00:16:35.71,00:16:35.71,>> This is... I'm a... I'll be...
297,00:16:37.71,00:16:37.71,I'll honor what I say right now. >> Absolutely.
298,00:16:39.71,00:16:39.71,>> You ever heard of a man named Babe Ruth?
299,00:16:42.25,00:16:42.25,He struck out more than anybody ever.
300,00:16:45.08,00:16:45.08,"But you know what? He also hit the most homeruns,"
301,00:16:48.08,00:16:48.08,"so that tells me one thing. Keep swinging, baby."
302,00:16:50.25,00:16:50.25,"Eventually, you're going to hit one."
303,00:16:52.29,00:16:52.29,"(laughs) >> No, I'm using a-a snail."
304,00:17:18.75,00:17:18.75,"Shambo's a really good person, and we do connect."
305,00:17:20.79,00:17:20.79,I think it has a lot to do with my Southern background.
306,00:17:23.62,00:17:23.62,People trust the South. So she could be one of my
307,00:17:26.08,00:17:26.08,"numbers. I mean, I could use her for"
308,00:17:28.83,00:17:28.83,that. >> Of course I am.
309,00:17:35.75,00:17:35.75,Knowing what a little spiteful snake she is.
310,00:17:38.88,00:17:38.88,She's half the battle. >> We got in quite the little
311,00:17:42.04,00:17:42.04,scene. She was just being a bitch to
312,00:17:44.58,00:17:44.58,"me. I said, ""What is your problem?"
313,00:17:47.25,00:17:47.25,"You've been very, very mean-spirited and just, you"
314,00:17:50.50,00:17:50.50,"know, awful to me."" >> Wow."
315,00:17:53.17,00:17:53.17,Shambo hates Laura. She hates her.
316,00:17:56.75,00:17:56.75,"So I know at any point, she'll vote Laura's name."
317,00:18:03.25,00:18:03.25,"You know, get rid of a strong player, Laura, and get rid of"
318,00:18:06.08,00:18:06.08,the snake. >> I trust Russell implicitly.
319,00:18:09.46,00:18:09.46,The guy is definitely cut from the same cloth as me.
320,00:18:11.79,00:18:11.79,He's a country boy. I'm a country girl.
321,00:18:14.25,00:18:14.25,And he just keeps bringing up that Laura needs to go first.
322,00:18:17.50,00:18:17.50,She's the bane of my existence in Samoa.
323,00:18:20.25,00:18:20.25,"So, it's not like we need this multi-layered plot."
324,00:18:23.42,00:18:23.42,Write Laura's name down tonight. It's that simple.
325,00:18:25.58,00:18:25.58,You need to make sure that you have the conversation.
326,00:18:28.17,00:18:28.17,Pull Jaison off to the side. >> Pull Mick off to the side.
327,00:18:35.96,00:18:35.96,">> Pull Natalie off to the side. >> And tell them, ""No matter"
328,00:18:40.29,00:18:40.29,"what, Laura is the only name we are writing down."" Okay?"
329,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,>> Sounds good to me. >> Outstanding. Carry on.
330,00:18:45.21,00:18:45.21,>> It was easy to control these minds.
331,00:18:48.08,00:18:48.08,"Way easier than I thought. John's on board, and I have"
332,00:18:52.04,00:18:52.04,"Shambo in my pocket. So if we can get rid of Laura,"
333,00:18:55.25,00:18:55.25,"this whole game might change. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
334,00:19:13.88,00:19:13.88,You have now merged into one tribe.
335,00:19:16.21,00:19:16.21,It's a completely different game.
336,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
337,00:19:20.62,00:19:20.62,>> Let's do it. >> Yeah.
338,00:19:22.62,00:19:22.62,">> Dave, I'll take back tribal immunity."
339,00:19:26.46,00:19:26.46,"Now that you're merged into one tribe, tribal immunity is no"
340,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,more. Individual immunity is what you
341,00:19:33.75,00:19:33.75,"covet. When you are wearing this, you"
342,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,are safe at Tribal Council. Let's get to the challenge.
343,00:19:39.21,00:19:39.21,"Today, you'll participate in a game of good, old-fashioned"
344,00:19:41.25,00:19:41.25,Survivor T-ball. It's very simple.
345,00:19:43.25,00:19:43.25,">> Sweet! >> PROBST: One at a time, you'll"
346,00:19:45.29,00:19:45.29,"place your ball on the tee, take a swing."
347,00:19:48.25,00:19:48.25,"Whatever section your ball lands in, you score that many points."
348,00:19:52.04,00:19:52.04,Highest score wins immunity. And for today's challenge...
349,00:19:59.08,00:19:59.08,there are two necklaces. (low whistles)
350,00:20:01.33,00:20:01.33,>> PROBST: Because two people will win immunity.
351,00:20:03.79,00:20:03.79,The women will take on the women.
352,00:20:06.12,00:20:06.12,The winner gets immunity. The men will take on the men.
353,00:20:08.42,00:20:08.42,The winner gets immunity. Make sense?
354,00:20:10.42,00:20:10.42,>> Yes. >> Mm-hmm.
355,00:20:12.42,00:20:12.42,>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.
356,00:20:16.75,00:20:16.75,"Dave Ball, you're first up for the men."
357,00:20:19.12,00:20:19.12,">> Let's go, Dave. >> Go, Dave."
358,00:20:21.12,00:20:21.12,">> Let's go, Danger Dave. >> Ugh!"
359,00:20:23.25,00:20:23.25,>> PROBST: Danger Dave. Baseball your sport?
360,00:20:26.71,00:20:26.71,">> Uh, no, making love's my sport."
361,00:20:29.12,00:20:29.12,(laughter) >> PROBST: You play a lot?
362,00:20:33.33,00:20:33.33,>> Not often enough. (laughter)
363,00:20:36.96,00:20:36.96,">> Geez. >> Let's go, Dave."
364,00:20:39.00,00:20:39.00,That a boy. >> PROBST: Nice swing.
365,00:20:41.17,00:20:41.17,Where's it going to drop? >> There you go!
366,00:20:43.21,00:20:43.21,">> PROBST: Pops into the three. >> Go, Dave."
367,00:20:45.08,00:20:45.08,>> PROBST: Not a bad score. >> Dave-O.
368,00:20:47.08,00:20:47.08,">> Good job, Dave. >> PROBST: Jaison now up."
369,00:20:50.67,00:20:50.67,Three is the mark to beat. Got a chance.
370,00:20:56.88,00:20:56.88,>> Oh! >> PROBST: On and off the course
371,00:20:59.12,00:20:59.12,"for Jaison. Jaison, you cannot win immunity."
372,00:21:01.54,00:21:01.54,(applause) >> Good job.
373,00:21:03.54,00:21:03.54,>> PROBST: Russell's up. Dave's still the mark to beat
374,00:21:06.42,00:21:06.42,at three. Russell gives it a ride.
375,00:21:11.46,00:21:11.46,">> Nice, Russ. >> All right, Russ."
376,00:21:13.42,00:21:13.42,>> PROBST: Lands it in the four. >> Nice.
377,00:21:15.42,00:21:15.42,">> Oh, man! >> PROBST: That puts Russell in"
378,00:21:17.42,00:21:17.42,the lead. >> Good shot.
379,00:21:19.42,00:21:19.42,">> Good job, Russell. >> PROBST: Brett is up."
380,00:21:21.54,00:21:21.54,"Russell has four, which means you have to land in a five or"
381,00:21:26.67,00:21:26.67,the ten up in the sky. That might do it.
382,00:21:33.46,00:21:33.46,">> Aw! >> Nice try, Brett."
383,00:21:35.46,00:21:35.46,">> PROBST: And off the course. >> Nice try, Brett."
384,00:21:37.42,00:21:37.42,">> Good shot, baby. >> PROBST: Brett cannot win"
385,00:21:39.42,00:21:39.42,immunity. >> That was a good hit.
386,00:21:41.42,00:21:41.42,">> Go, Mick. >> PROBST: Mick is up."
387,00:21:43.12,00:21:43.12,Russell still in the lead at four.
388,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,Mick needs to get something in the four to five range here.
389,00:21:50.54,00:21:50.54,That won't do it. Mick scores two.
390,00:21:52.58,00:21:52.58,>> Ugh! >> PROBST: That's not enough.
391,00:21:54.67,00:21:54.67,"Mick out of this challenge. Erik, take your swing."
392,00:21:57.67,00:21:57.67,Russell still in the lead with four points.
393,00:22:00.33,00:22:00.33,">> Going for the ten, baby. >> PROBST: Going for the ten."
394,00:22:03.38,00:22:03.38,">> Let's go, Erik. >> PROBST: All the marbles."
395,00:22:05.38,00:22:05.38,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Oh! A nice swing.
396,00:22:09.83,00:22:09.83,"Just off the course, though. Ends up zero."
397,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,">> Good swing, though. >> You looked good."
398,00:22:14.33,00:22:14.33,">> Thanks. >> Yeah, at least you looked"
399,00:22:16.33,00:22:16.33,good. >> PROBST: John.
400,00:22:18.33,00:22:18.33,>> All right. >> PROBST: The last person.
401,00:22:21.21,00:22:21.21,Russell is one person away from winning immunity.
402,00:22:25.21,00:22:25.21,"Russell with four, which means, John, you have to land in a five"
403,00:22:30.17,00:22:30.17,or the ten to win immunity. John gives it a ride.
404,00:22:46.08,00:22:46.08,Nicely done. John lands in the five.
405,00:22:48.33,00:22:48.33,>> My God! (applause)
406,00:22:50.33,00:22:50.33,>> PROBST: John wins individual immunity.
407,00:22:52.58,00:22:52.58,">> Nice one, John! >> Holy crap, Johnny!"
408,00:22:56.21,00:22:56.21,">> Good job, John. >> PROBST: All right."
409,00:22:59.08,00:22:59.08,"The women are now up. Natalie, you're first up for"
410,00:23:05.21,00:23:05.21,"the women. >> Oh, man."
411,00:23:15.17,00:23:15.17,>> PROBST: Natalie down and hard.
412,00:23:17.21,00:23:17.21,It bounces out of the course. (all groaning)
413,00:23:19.21,00:23:19.21,No score for Natalie. >> No! Nat!
414,00:23:21.25,00:23:21.25,">> Oh, goodness! >> PROBST: Monica's up."
415,00:23:24.25,00:23:24.25,"Another lefty. Monica, nice swing."
416,00:23:28.54,00:23:28.54,">> Girl. >> Oh, God."
417,00:23:30.54,00:23:30.54,>> PROBST: Ends up in the two. Monica scores two.
418,00:23:32.38,00:23:32.38,">> That a way, baby. >> PROBST: Kelly, you're up."
419,00:23:35.50,00:23:35.50,"Two is the mark to beat. >> Oh, good job, Kelly."
420,00:23:41.12,00:23:41.12,>> PROBST: Kelly. >> Oh!
421,00:23:43.12,00:23:43.12,">> PROBST: With a three. >> Good job, Kel!"
422,00:23:45.12,00:23:45.12,>> PROBST: That puts Kelly in the lead.
423,00:23:48.04,00:23:48.04,"Shambo's up. >> Let's go, Sham."
424,00:23:51.62,00:23:51.62,>> PROBST: Three is the mark to beat.
425,00:23:55.21,00:23:55.21,Big swing. >> Lovely.
426,00:23:57.25,00:23:57.25,>> PROBST: Little result. >> Outstanding.
427,00:23:59.25,00:23:59.25,">> PROBST: No score for Shambo. Laura, you're up."
428,00:24:02.33,00:24:02.33,>> Score. >> PROBST: The last person.
429,00:24:04.62,00:24:04.62,Kelly-- still the mark to beat at three.
430,00:24:07.62,00:24:07.62,You're going to need at least a four to win immunity.
431,00:24:21.83,00:24:21.83,Laura lands it in the four. Laura wins individual immunity!
432,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,"(applause) >> Good job, Laura."
433,00:24:29.04,00:24:29.04,">> You did good. >> PROBST: Laura, John, come on"
434,00:24:32.54,00:24:32.54,over. Congratulations.
435,00:24:37.25,00:24:37.25,(applause) >> Good job.
436,00:24:39.25,00:24:39.25,>> PROBST: Congratulations. Safe tonight at Tribal Council.
437,00:24:43.58,00:24:43.58,John and Laura cannot be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council.
438,00:24:47.50,00:24:47.50,"As for the rest of you, one of you going home tonight."
439,00:24:50.21,00:24:50.21,Should be an interesting afternoon for the newly-merged
440,00:24:52.67,00:24:52.67,"camp. By the way, what is your name?"
441,00:24:55.04,00:24:55.04,>> Aiga. >> PROBST: Aiga.
442,00:24:57.04,00:24:57.04,"All right, Aiga, grab your stuff, head back to camp."
443,00:24:59.12,00:24:59.12,See you at Tribal. >> When I saw Laura win
444,00:25:03.46,00:25:03.46,"immunity, I got a gut-wrenching feeling in my stomach."
445,00:25:06.92,00:25:06.92,The plan had been put into motion.
446,00:25:09.04,00:25:09.04,"We were going to write down Laura's name tonight, and now we"
447,00:25:11.71,00:25:11.71,"can't. So, that sucked, because I"
448,00:25:14.79,00:25:14.79,really wanted her gone. >> Thank you.
449,00:25:37.08,00:25:37.08,>> They can't win anything. >> No. No.
450,00:25:44.00,00:25:44.00,>> Yeah. >> I don't know 'cause I haven't
451,00:25:54.25,00:25:54.25,talked to anybody yet. >> I'm getting rid of the girl
452,00:25:59.67,00:25:59.67,"thing. >> Well, dude, that ain't going"
453,00:26:01.96,00:26:01.96,to happen. >> You don't think?
454,00:26:03.96,00:26:03.96,>> No. The problem is Erik and Laura--
455,00:26:07.04,00:26:07.04,they will decide who will go today.
456,00:26:09.58,00:26:09.58,"If that means that we will lose a number on your tribe, we lose"
457,00:26:11.96,00:26:11.96,a number. >> Laura would definitely be
458,00:26:14.54,00:26:14.54,"gone, but she won immunity today, and Shambo-- she don't"
459,00:26:17.92,00:26:17.92,want to get rid of Monica. She says that's not going to
460,00:26:20.21,00:26:20.21,happen. She wants to let one of our
461,00:26:22.12,00:26:22.12,"guys go. I'm sure I'm being targeted, so"
462,00:26:25.42,00:26:25.42,"I don't want to have to play the idol, but if I'm feeling antsy"
463,00:26:29.25,00:26:29.25,"about tonight, I might have to go that route."
464,00:26:41.96,00:26:41.96,>> Yes. >> Uh-huh.
465,00:26:44.96,00:26:44.96,I know he has it. >> Mm-hmm.
466,00:26:49.21,00:26:49.21,>> Damn it! He thinks he's going to go
467,00:26:51.21,00:26:51.21,"first, so I bet you he's going to play it tonight anyways."
468,00:26:58.62,00:26:58.62,>> Yeah. Yeah... >> Perfect.
469,00:27:18.54,00:27:18.54,>> So the fact that he has it seems kind of dangerous.
470,00:27:26.12,00:27:26.12,">> I know, I know. >> We all know that. I know."
471,00:27:28.12,00:27:28.12,"Listen. Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me."
472,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,This morning it was supposed to be Laura.
473,00:27:32.12,00:27:32.12,"Laura won immunity, saved Laura. The next best thing that you can"
474,00:27:34.92,00:27:34.92,do to weaken Laura is to ax Monica.
475,00:27:37.04,00:27:37.04,Some members of Galu-- they just want to go down the line--
476,00:27:40.46,00:27:40.46,"Foa Foa, Foa Foa, and it's like they're playing really junior"
477,00:27:44.04,00:27:44.04,varsity Survivor right now. There are tons of inherent risks
478,00:27:48.29,00:27:48.29,to breaking up the team that we've worked this far to develop
479,00:27:51.54,00:27:51.54,"at Galu, but it's a risk I'm comfortable with, because I"
480,00:27:53.54,00:27:53.54,still believe that it's in our best interest to get rid of
481,00:27:56.67,00:27:56.67,Monica. >> I can calm her down.
482,00:28:02.88,00:28:02.88,">> But you keep her at bay, you keep her at bay."
483,00:28:04.88,00:28:04.88,">> I can calm her down. You know, at first I didn't like"
484,00:28:06.88,00:28:06.88,"the idea. However, by allowing me to vote"
485,00:28:08.88,00:28:08.88,"with Laura, when she gets spooked after Tribal Council,"
486,00:28:11.50,00:28:11.50,"she'll have nobody to turn to but me, and I can go ahead, gain"
487,00:28:15.75,00:28:15.75,"her trust, which could be good for me down the road."
488,00:28:22.04,00:28:22.04,>> Are we gonna use Foa Foa? >> We are?
489,00:28:24.50,00:28:24.50,>> Yeah. >> Here's what needs to happen.
490,00:28:36.83,00:28:36.83,A: nobody talks to Shambo. Period.
491,00:28:38.88,00:28:38.88,>> Perfect. >> Let her vote whatever she
492,00:28:40.88,00:28:40.88,wants. >> Okay?
493,00:28:49.04,00:28:49.04,">> If you go Monica, Monica, Monica, it's done."
494,00:28:51.46,00:28:51.46,>> Yeah. >> Erik-- he wanted to vote
495,00:28:55.00,00:28:55.00,"Monica, which is crazy. The plan to just vote Foa Foa"
496,00:28:59.12,00:28:59.12,"and shoot them down, you know, turkey shoot-- pop, pop, pop,"
497,00:29:02.62,00:29:02.62,"pop, so there may be something going on in Erik's head that"
498,00:29:06.88,00:29:06.88,"he's not letting on 'cause he's a crafty, crafty dude, and that"
499,00:29:11.54,00:29:11.54,makes me a little nervous. (buzzing)
500,00:29:25.17,00:29:25.17,">> ...then definitely the three of you will stay, and I'm pretty"
501,00:29:28.79,00:29:28.79,"sure Russell will stay, anyway, so..."
502,00:29:36.46,00:29:36.46,We want him to think that he's going home tonight.
503,00:29:38.75,00:29:38.75,"That way, he plays the idol. So, what you need to know, you"
504,00:29:45.12,00:29:45.12,"know. You choose a different route,"
505,00:29:47.17,00:29:47.17,"there will be a different outcome, I can't guarantee the"
506,00:29:49.17,00:29:49.17,four of you are here tomorrow. >> Here's how I feel right now.
507,00:29:58.21,00:29:58.21,I feel like Erik is talking ... to the tribe.
508,00:30:11.71,00:30:11.71,>> Erik told us that if we get Russell to flush out the idol
509,00:30:14.54,00:30:14.54,"and use it tonight, they will agree to vote out one of their"
510,00:30:17.25,00:30:17.25,"own, um, instead of one of us, but to be honest with you, I"
511,00:30:21.92,00:30:21.92,don't really like that guy. So I kind of want to just put
512,00:30:25.21,00:30:25.21,four votes on Erik and-and let the ball roll.
513,00:30:28.00,00:30:28.00,>> I don't know who... >> But I could leave this game
514,00:30:34.25,00:30:34.25,"easily, knowing that he went before me."
515,00:30:50.25,00:30:50.25,>> Why is he freaking out? >> He wants all of the girls
516,00:30:52.46,00:30:52.46,gone. >> I don't trust Erik.
517,00:30:54.67,00:30:54.67,">> He was... Here's the thing. >> Well, because there's no way"
518,00:31:01.50,00:31:01.50,"to pull it together. Like, we can ask Kel."
519,00:31:03.50,00:31:03.50,">> Okay, okay. >> Okay, Kel."
520,00:31:16.04,00:31:16.04,">> The thing of it is, like, Galu still has plenty of people,"
521,00:31:18.04,00:31:18.04,"plenty. I'm telling you, y'all, he is"
522,00:31:23.58,00:31:23.58,going to wreak havoc. Kelly and Laura-- I just
523,00:31:26.46,00:31:26.46,basically let them know that Erik needed to go now.
524,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,We have four people. They have eight.
525,00:31:32.04,00:31:32.04,It's not a big deal if they lose one.
526,00:31:34.58,00:31:34.58,"I'm definitely putting my faith in Laura and Kelly, and I'm just"
527,00:31:37.54,00:31:37.54,going to hope that it works. >> What?!
528,00:31:44.17,00:31:44.17,>> He's trying to get you off tonight.
529,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,>> Are you serious? >> Yeah.
530,00:31:52.04,00:31:52.04,>> Really? Everyone's on board? >> He's manipulating everybody.
531,00:32:02.75,00:32:02.75,">> Yeah, I know, but... >> Tonight Erik goes."
532,00:32:11.08,00:32:11.08,>> Who's Erik? >> Erik.
533,00:32:13.08,00:32:13.08,>> Our Erik? >> Yes.
534,00:32:21.04,00:32:21.04,>> Wait. >> This is the first time that I
535,00:32:28.29,00:32:28.29,"don't know nothin'. All of a sudden, all hell breaks"
536,00:32:31.04,00:32:31.04,loose. All the girls want to vote Erik
537,00:32:34.33,00:32:34.33,out now. I don't know what they're
538,00:32:36.42,00:32:36.42,"thinking. They could possibly be saying,"
539,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,"""Hey, let's say, vote Erik. That way Russell will feel way"
540,00:32:42.83,00:32:42.83,"comfortable, won't use his idol, we'll vote him out."""
541,00:32:45.08,00:32:45.08,"And then, they get me and the idol."
542,00:32:47.38,00:32:47.38,>> This is like going to Vegas. >> Yeah.
543,00:32:49.38,00:32:49.38,">> What else can we do? They blindside one of us, we go"
544,00:32:51.54,00:32:51.54,"home, we eat pizza. >> What concerns me is that it"
545,00:32:55.08,00:32:55.08,"just seems almost too easy right now, and that makes me"
546,00:32:58.25,00:32:58.25,"uncomfortable. Fortunately, I got my idol in"
547,00:33:01.75,00:33:01.75,"my pocket, and I'll use it if need to use it."
548,00:33:29.29,00:33:29.29,">> PROBST: Jaison, take me through the merge."
549,00:33:31.75,00:33:31.75,Foa Foa's already down to four people.
550,00:33:34.21,00:33:34.21,Now you have to go over to Galu's camp where they've been
551,00:33:36.79,00:33:36.79,"living this whole time. >> I mean, it's almost as"
552,00:33:39.42,00:33:39.42,"frustrating as-as losing challenges, you know?"
553,00:33:41.46,00:33:41.46,"But at least with the challenges, we had some say in"
554,00:33:43.79,00:33:43.79,"it. So for me, a guy who is used to"
555,00:33:46.21,00:33:46.21,"having at least some control over his life, I think more than"
556,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,"even frustration, you just feel helpless."
557,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,">> PROBST: Monica, how does this merge change the trust in the"

560,00:34:01.25,00:34:01.25,"to trust the people on my tribe? >> In this game, you never"
561,00:34:04.17,00:34:04.17,"really know who to trust. I mean, someone could be saying"
562,00:34:07.12,00:34:07.12,"something to your face, and then saying something completely"
563,00:34:10.00,00:34:10.00,different behind your back. So even though Foa Foa is down
564,00:34:13.58,00:34:13.58,"in numbers, someone could turn their back on you."
565,00:34:16.04,00:34:16.04,"You just really never know. >> PROBST: Erik, looking at the"
566,00:34:20.00,00:34:20.00,"four Foa Foa, what do you think Galu should base the vote on?"

568,00:34:28.21,00:34:28.21,to offer Galu. Let's just say that they were
569,00:34:32.88,00:34:32.88,"able to get a Galu member to turn in a very cohesive team, I"
570,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,"would be floored if I saw them get one, let alone two or three"
571,00:34:41.12,00:34:41.12,that they would need to actually spin this game.
572,00:34:43.50,00:34:43.50,And that's not me being cocky or confident.
573,00:34:46.04,00:34:46.04,"But I just struggle to see what it is that they can do, you"
574,00:34:49.50,00:34:49.50,"know. Your heart goes out to them,"
575,00:34:51.88,00:34:51.88,"but, you know, they're in the hole."
576,00:34:54.17,00:34:54.17,">> PROBST: Russell, Erik's saying, ""You don't offer us"
577,00:34:56.58,00:34:56.58,"anything. Why do we need you at all?"""

579,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,"offer, and I think he's going to be surprised."

581,00:35:08.12,00:35:08.12,"one, so it's a long shot. >> PROBST: But can you"
582,00:35:12.50,00:35:12.50,"understand why somebody who's down in numbers, like Foa Foa,"
583,00:35:16.21,00:35:16.21,would do anything to try to stay alive?
584,00:35:19.38,00:35:19.38,">> I think one way to look at it is, how is it that they've"
585,00:35:22.38,00:35:22.38,reacted to the merge and mingling with us?
586,00:35:24.71,00:35:24.71,I'll tell you right now-- Russ goes out there and scrambles.
587,00:35:27.83,00:35:27.83,"He's been in everybody's ear. Uh, Mick comes in, he does his"
588,00:35:30.50,00:35:30.50,"thing, he takes it on the chin. He says the numbers are what"
589,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,they are. Natalie doesn't want to step on
590,00:35:35.04,00:35:35.04,"anybody's toes. And Jaison is-is just an enigma,"
591,00:35:38.42,00:35:38.42,"because you see this intelligence, and you see this"
592,00:35:40.58,00:35:40.58,"physical prowess and his athleticism, but you don't"
593,00:35:43.12,00:35:43.12,"really see it come together. >> PROBST: Jaison, basically"
594,00:35:47.71,00:35:47.71,"saying you got great potential, but not doing anything with it."
595,00:35:51.04,00:35:51.04,">> Um, you can take a look at my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9."
596,00:35:53.58,00:35:53.58,I'm here to play a game. I'm here to be strategic in my
597,00:35:56.33,00:35:56.33,"own way. So, I have a strong, strong"
598,00:35:58.62,00:35:58.62,problem with that... with that comment.

603,00:36:11.88,00:36:11.88,says I can't put it together just-- they-they eat at me.
604,00:36:14.88,00:36:14.88,"You know, for 28 years, I've been fighting to-to do things,"
605,00:36:18.83,00:36:18.83,"to accomplish things, and I feel like people have doubted me the"
606,00:36:22.42,00:36:22.42,"entire way, and I've had to push through roadblocks that I"
607,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,"couldn't go around or under or over, and so I think maybe it"
608,00:36:30.17,00:36:30.17,just takes me back to those days.
609,00:36:32.46,00:36:32.46,"And I've tried to play this game hard, but not take it too"
610,00:36:35.12,00:36:35.12,"seriously, but sometimes, you know, something just kicks in,"
611,00:36:37.21,00:36:37.21,"so... >> Well, I like that."
612,00:36:39.21,00:36:39.21,"You know, I like that in a player."
613,00:36:41.50,00:36:41.50,"If I was your coach, I would say that's what I like to hear."
614,00:36:44.17,00:36:44.17,>> I guess the point is that I don't care what you like.

616,00:36:50.42,00:36:50.42,to the Foa Foa group. Are you feeling a little
617,00:36:52.88,00:36:52.88,"attacked or maybe misunderstood? >> No, not at all."
618,00:36:56.38,00:36:56.38,"You know, we can still make this happen."
619,00:36:58.92,00:36:58.92,"This... We still have hope. >> PROBST: So, Erik, you got"
620,00:37:01.96,00:37:01.96,"to respect Russell saying, ""I don't care that we're down to"

624,00:37:10.75,00:37:10.75,I respect that. But this type of competitiveness
625,00:37:13.96,00:37:13.96,"is misaligned, and if he doesn't focus it within the next couple"
626,00:37:18.42,00:37:18.42,"of days, if it's repairable, then I can't say 100% I respect"

628,00:37:23.79,00:37:23.79,"over and get voted out quietly. Well, that ain't going to"
629,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,happen. I will talk to each and every

631,00:37:32.29,00:37:32.29,to try to stay in this game. I ain't going to stop playing.
