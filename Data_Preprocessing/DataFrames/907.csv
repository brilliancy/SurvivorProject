568,00:31:14.46,00:31:14.46,of four.>> Rory got a little cocky
569,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,"with his winnings, as he wellshould."
570,00:31:18.21,00:31:18.21,"Otherwise he'd be going home,you know?"
571,00:31:20.50,00:31:20.50,"He's earned that right.So I'm really glad that we won,"
572,00:31:23.79,00:31:23.79,"but at the same time I lookedover at Lopevi, right, as soon"
573,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,"as we won, and I looked atJulie, and it hurt."
574,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,It hurt to know that eitherJulie or Twila are going home
575,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,tonight.>> We lost the challenge
576,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,"today, and we're going to TribalCouncil."
577,00:32:01.79,00:32:01.79,"Today was the foundation, thebasis of the rest of the game"
578,00:32:07.08,00:32:07.08,"for us, but losing today meantit's equal to them, 5-5."
579,00:32:10.83,00:32:10.83,The strategy of the game haschanged now.
580,00:32:13.08,00:32:13.08,It could go anywhere.>> I'm not confident
581,00:32:15.38,00:32:15.38,"Julie's staying with us, dude.If we merge, she's going right"
582,00:32:18.00,00:32:18.00,with the women.>> Julie said to me
583,00:32:21.00,00:32:21.00,"earlier this afternoon, she'dlike to get rid of John."
584,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,">> Well, yeah, there you go.See, she's thinking it's her"
585,00:32:27.46,00:32:27.46,"turn, man.If we merge, John's gone, she's"
586,00:32:30.04,00:32:30.04,"with the women, we're gone.Trust in this game is huge, and"
587,00:32:34.75,00:32:34.75,"at this stage, it's even bigger,because there's more at stake."
588,00:32:38.75,00:32:38.75,"John, I don't trust, and Julie--I don't believe that she would"
589,00:32:42.62,00:32:42.62,definitely stay with Lopevi ifwe merge.
590,00:32:45.38,00:32:45.38,"As much as I don't want to keepJohn around, if we keep John and"
591,00:32:48.29,00:32:48.29,"Julie goes next, we've got theguys."
592,00:32:50.62,00:32:50.62,>> John has been a targetto send home ever since the game
593,00:32:54.50,00:32:54.50,"started.I mean, he was on the other side"
594,00:32:56.62,00:32:56.62,"with the guys, but Chad'sconcerned that maybe keeping"
595,00:33:00.25,00:33:00.25,John around a little bit longermight be the best thing.
596,00:33:03.71,00:33:03.71,He doesn't have a whole lot oftrust in Julie.
597,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,">> It's up in the air,man, with John."
598,00:33:08.83,00:33:08.83,I don't know.If-if I'm convinced that Julie's
599,00:33:10.71,00:33:10.71,"with us, then we can get rid ofJohn, but, I mean, otherwise,"
600,00:33:13.29,00:33:13.29,it's a male-female thing.The women's going to be a huge
601,00:33:16.21,00:33:16.21,"enticement for her to go over.Man, she's..."
602,00:33:18.79,00:33:18.79,I can tell she's...>> I don't think they're
603,00:33:20.38,00:33:20.38,"so much women, or they wouldn'thave voted off Lisa."
604,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,I don't think they're hung up onjust the women.
605,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,>> ( sighs )It's going to be tough.
606,00:33:29.04,00:33:29.04,It's not solid anymore rightnow.
607,00:33:50.00,00:33:50.00,">> What does Chad say,anything?"
608,00:33:52.00,00:33:52.00,>> Sometimes I don't knowwhere Chad's coming from.
609,00:33:55.00,00:33:55.00,"Every time, it doesn't matterhow much you talk to him, you"
610,00:33:57.17,00:33:57.17,still go to Tribal Council withdoubt.
611,00:33:59.42,00:33:59.42,">> In my tribe, I don'ttrust anyone."
612,00:34:01.21,00:34:01.21,"I can't trust anyone, but I haveto at least put my faith in one"
613,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"person, and I do with Chris,because I think me and Chris can"
614,00:34:08.08,00:34:08.08,really do some damage when itcomes down to the...
615,00:34:10.25,00:34:10.25,to thedwindling of-of both tribes.
616,00:34:13.21,00:34:13.21,">> Just off the top ofyour head, if we was leaving"
617,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,"right now, who would you want tovote for?"
618,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,">> See, the thing is,I'd say Julie, but I really"
619,00:34:19.42,00:34:19.42,"don't think she'd vote on thegirls' side, so I think she's an"
620,00:34:22.00,00:34:22.00,"asset to have later on.And I think with-with Chad, he"
621,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,"gets the sympathy vote.Sounds bad, but it's true, you"
622,00:34:27.62,00:34:27.62,know?>> I'm coming to grips with...
623,00:34:30.08,00:34:30.08,"You know, I understand whatyou're saying."
624,00:34:32.08,00:34:32.08,>> If it ever came downto him and one of us in the

627,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,"I thought of Chad since day one,because he's type of guy that"
628,00:34:41.21,00:34:41.21,"just gets by every time; notjust gets by on the vote, but"
629,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,just gets by without anyonenoticing him.
630,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,"And Chad can seriously get somesympathy points, which he's"
631,00:34:50.21,00:34:50.21,"great at, because he does haveone leg, and he's doing amazing,"
632,00:34:52.83,00:34:52.83,"but we can't handle any sympathypoints against us, so he's got"
633,00:34:56.83,00:34:56.83,to go now.What's up with you guys?
634,00:35:00.96,00:35:00.96,">> Stacking some wood, boy.>> Oh, yeah?"
635,00:35:03.33,00:35:03.33,>> What are you doing?>> Wondering which one of
636,00:35:05.38,00:35:05.38,us is going home tonight.>> That's what I came
637,00:35:07.46,00:35:07.46,to tell you.Chad.
638,00:35:10.04,00:35:10.04,">> So, you want Chad tonight?>> Yeah, Chad tonight."
639,00:35:12.00,00:35:12.00,>> It's not going to beme or her?
640,00:35:13.17,00:35:13.17,>> It's not going...I swear on my life that it's not
641,00:35:14.79,00:35:14.79,"you two.>> Go ahead, hon."
642,00:35:15.83,00:35:15.83,I'll be there later.>> But me-me and Chris
643,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,"are being seriously true onthis, and we just think we-we"
644,00:35:21.17,00:35:21.17,could all be tighter with thisgroup.
645,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,">> Julie, are you comfortablewith that-- voting off Chad?"
646,00:35:26.21,00:35:26.21,">> Depends on, uh, Sarge,right, if he's down?"
647,00:35:28.92,00:35:28.92,">> Yeah.>> Well, even if Sarge"
648,00:35:30.25,00:35:30.25,"isn't, that means it'severyone against..."
649,00:35:31.92,00:35:31.92,">> Oh, three against...>> It would be..."
650,00:35:33.04,00:35:33.04,it'd beus four against Chad.
651,00:35:34.54,00:35:34.54,">> Yeah, us four.I take Twila's word, 'cause she"
652,00:35:36.46,00:35:36.46,"is a rough redneck, and to me,all rough rednecks that I have"
653,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00,"met are pretty loyal.At this point, everyone could be"
654,00:35:48.12,00:35:48.12,"completely playing everyone, sopeople are either going with"
655,00:35:50.75,00:35:50.75,"what I said, or people are goingto vote me off, so I-I can't"

657,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,figure out where I stand in thisgame.

661,00:36:24.71,00:36:24.71,"seemed to be going so well forLopevi, and then out of nowhere,"
662,00:36:27.92,00:36:27.92,back-to-back losses.What happened?
663,00:36:30.62,00:36:30.62,">> I don't know.You know, it seemed like when,"
664,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,"you know, we-we-we-we went onfour wins in a row."
665,00:36:35.42,00:36:35.42,It seemed like we weredominating.

667,00:36:39.58,00:36:39.58,"I mean, you know, they-they beatus by a couple, uh, but that's"
668,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,"all it takes, and that's whywe're here and they're not."

672,00:36:51.04,00:36:51.04,>> Right.When we are
673,00:36:52.12,00:36:52.12,"going off to do our little woodgathering and pot scrubbing,"

675,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,"maybe you shouldn't be alone,and, you know, so there's a lot"
676,00:37:02.25,00:37:02.25,"of posturing going on, you know.We're scrambling here before,"
677,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,"uh, Tribal Council.>> PROBST: Chris, does everybody"
678,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,have a role in this tribe?>> I think to a certain

680,00:37:12.08,00:37:12.08,"Um, everybody does somethingthat benefits the tribe during"
681,00:37:16.17,00:37:16.17,the day.There's always a time when we're
682,00:37:18.62,00:37:18.62,"going to need to eat, and, uh,we're going to need firewood,"
683,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,and there's always someonewilling to step up and do that.
684,00:37:23.83,00:37:23.83,"I think it's a team effort.>> PROBST: Sarge, what does"
685,00:37:26.71,00:37:26.71,"Twila do well?>> Um, Twila is the, uh,"
686,00:37:30.46,00:37:30.46,"wonder for, um, exotic foods.She is the preparer of meals,"
687,00:37:36.21,00:37:36.21,and she's constantly going toget firewood.
688,00:37:38.79,00:37:38.79,She-she just...she does

693,00:37:49.79,00:37:49.79,love to see her take naps.I would...
694,00:37:53.04,00:37:53.04,I would love it.I would not feel distressed
