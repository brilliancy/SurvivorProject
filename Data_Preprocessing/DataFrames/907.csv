4,00:00:08.00,00:00:08.00,Rory played the anger card. >> You guys are so smoked
5,00:00:10.71,00:00:10.71,in that you don't even see honesty when it comes right at
6,00:00:13.62,00:00:13.62,y'all. The ladies made a mistake in
7,00:00:15.25,00:00:15.25,telling me that I would've been eliminated before Bubba was.
8,00:00:18.88,00:00:18.88,I'm going to play it up. >> What are you thinking?
9,00:00:21.92,00:00:21.92,">> PROBST: At Lopevi, Julie and Twila considered their"
10,00:00:24.46,00:00:24.46,situation at the new tribe. >> There's no doubt about it.

12,00:00:28.96,00:00:28.96,"Being the only two women over here, we're both vulnerable."
13,00:00:31.04,00:00:31.04,We know it. >> Is it that a pig?
14,00:00:33.00,00:00:33.00,">> PROBST: When tree mail arrived, Rory gathered the women"
15,00:00:35.21,00:00:35.21,and put it all on the line. >> My apologies to all of
16,00:00:38.04,00:00:38.04,"you for the horrible, horrible things that I said last night,"
17,00:00:40.33,00:00:40.33,but I will not continue to slave around camp if I do not have a
18,00:00:45.17,00:00:45.17,shot at making it through Tribal Council.
19,00:00:47.88,00:00:47.88,There's no way in hell these ladies bought any of that.
20,00:00:50.54,00:00:50.54,">> PROBST: At the reward challenge, the tribes played for"
21,00:00:52.92,00:00:52.92,steak and eggs. Go!
22,00:00:55.46,00:00:55.46,"In a muddy race to gather pigs, Lopevi took a commanding lead."
23,00:00:59.08,00:00:59.08,>> Eliza trying. She can't do it.
24,00:01:01.08,00:01:01.08,When Eliza let her tribe down... Lopevi wins reward!
25,00:01:04.58,00:01:04.58,Back at camp... >> Anybody want Cajun spice
26,00:01:06.42,00:01:06.42,on their steak? >> PROBST: ...Lopevi savored
27,00:01:08.08,00:01:08.08,their victory. >> This is better than sex
28,00:01:09.83,00:01:09.83,"right now. Oh, damn!"
29,00:01:12.42,00:01:12.42,">> PROBST: While at Yasur, Eliza took the loss hard..."
30,00:01:15.79,00:01:15.79,>> I'm not used to being bad at things.

32,00:01:18.96,00:01:18.96,>> I think I just found my little tiny crack.

36,00:01:30.71,00:01:30.71,>> Lea is someone that knows what it means to give your
37,00:01:32.67,00:01:32.67,"word. I said, ""Twila, you got my word"
38,00:01:34.50,00:01:34.50,"as a man, you are in the four to the end."""
39,00:01:37.50,00:01:37.50,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, it was Leann who cost"
40,00:01:40.21,00:01:40.21,"Yasur the victory. Leann getting a second wind, but"
41,00:01:44.25,00:01:44.25,it's not enough. Lopevi wins immunity!
42,00:01:47.17,00:01:47.17,And Lopevi won their fourth challenge in a row.
43,00:01:50.21,00:01:50.21,"Before Tribal Council, Lisa offended Ami."
44,00:01:53.62,00:01:53.62,>> Do you want me to go get more manioc?
45,00:01:56.50,00:01:56.50,">> Whoa, in case what? Lisa said, oh, she wanted to"
46,00:01:59.00,00:01:59.00,know where the manioc was just in case I wasn't around.
47,00:02:01.12,00:02:01.12,Oops. Did that really just come
48,00:02:03.33,00:02:03.33,"out your mouth? >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
49,00:02:06.67,00:02:06.67,"Ami's distrust for Lisa caused the female alliance to crumble,"
50,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,and Lisa was voted out of the tribe.
51,00:02:12.75,00:02:12.75,"Lisa, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left."
52,00:02:17.79,00:02:17.79,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
53,00:02:58.04,00:02:58.04,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> The camp's running really
54,00:03:47.17,00:03:47.17,"well. I mean, everyone kind of has"
55,00:03:48.71,00:03:48.71,"just fallen into some work roles, and, uh, most of us do"
56,00:03:52.17,00:03:52.17,"several things. Everybody's getting water, doing"
57,00:03:54.54,00:03:54.54,the dishes. There's one person that's not
58,00:03:57.17,00:03:57.17,"doing his share, and that's John."
59,00:04:07.38,00:04:07.38,>> I feel fine today. I'm tired and bored.
60,00:04:10.38,00:04:10.38,"For the most part, there's really not much to do around"
61,00:04:12.21,00:04:12.21,"here, so we just kind of kick back and relax."
62,00:04:20.17,00:04:20.17,">> John is an enigma. I wanted to ask him today, ""How"
63,00:04:23.08,00:04:23.08,can you sit there and look around at us while everyone else
64,00:04:26.54,00:04:26.54,"is working?"" It's beyond me, but he just does"
65,00:04:28.75,00:04:28.75,it. He's gotten away with it to this
66,00:04:31.62,00:04:31.62,"point, but now we're starting to make comments."
67,00:04:34.00,00:04:34.00,">> He grubs the food. >> Yeah, he does."
68,00:04:35.92,00:04:35.92,>> He'll eat three or four bowls.
69,00:04:37.08,00:04:37.08,">> I know. >> Well, I could eat"
70,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,"three or four bowls, you know. I'd make sure everybody else is"
71,00:04:40.08,00:04:40.08,"getting the same amount, but I'd eat more."
72,00:04:41.79,00:04:41.79,">> I think he realizes he's doing it, too."
73,00:04:43.62,00:04:43.62,"It's like, ""Oh, man, that was..."" I don't want to judge"
74,00:04:45.83,00:04:45.83,"the dude, but... >> He's the kind of person that"
75,00:04:47.92,00:04:47.92,coasts through the game. >> Yeah.
76,00:04:49.58,00:04:49.58,>> That's exactly what he is. >> He is.
77,00:04:51.29,00:04:51.29,>> And he's not coasting through this game with us in it.
78,00:04:53.62,00:04:53.62,">> No, no way. >> When I, uh, wake up in"
79,00:05:08.21,00:05:08.21,"the morning, usually the first thing that I do is I bow down"
80,00:05:11.62,00:05:11.62,"and I pray, and today in particular, I got a lot of"
81,00:05:15.83,00:05:15.83,"things to be thankful for, because for some twist in fate,"
82,00:05:20.21,00:05:20.21,"I cracked these ladies, and they carried me through one more"
83,00:05:22.62,00:05:22.62,"night. So this morning, I was"
84,00:05:25.08,00:05:25.08,"particularly thankful, and I might not be able to bounce"
85,00:05:27.33,00:05:27.33,"around laughing and smiling, but I'm just so thankful."
86,00:05:31.92,00:05:31.92,Then it's down to business. So my new objective is to work
87,00:05:35.50,00:05:35.50,"on Leann and Ami and wrap myself into their relationship, 'cause"
88,00:05:40.17,00:05:40.17,I'm still an alliance of one right now.
89,00:05:43.38,00:05:43.38,"Well, Ami, here's my situation. I need to know where you guys"
90,00:05:49.08,00:05:49.08,"stand with regard to me, because there's no way in hell I want to"
91,00:05:53.75,00:05:53.75,be eliminated before Eliza. I had explained to you that I
92,00:05:57.29,00:05:57.29,would back you all the way through jury and everything
93,00:06:00.29,00:06:00.29,else. >> The biggest thing... the
94,00:06:04.71,00:06:04.71,biggest thing for all the women was no women's alliance has
95,00:06:07.12,00:06:07.12,"stayed together through this game ever, not once, ever."
96,00:06:10.17,00:06:10.17,That's kind of what's keeping us going is that we want women...
97,00:06:13.38,00:06:13.38,>> Then what I'm going to tell you this.
98,00:06:15.21,00:06:15.21,"You know, if-if I get smoked, how far are you guys going to"
99,00:06:18.79,00:06:18.79,"go, you know? And for me, just on a personal"
100,00:06:21.21,00:06:21.21,"level, I mean, give me a break. Eliza over me?"
101,00:06:26.00,00:06:26.00,"How much can she bring to this team, and how much have I"
102,00:06:28.46,00:06:28.46,"already brought to the table? >> Unfortunately for you,"
103,00:06:31.12,00:06:31.12,the fact that the women had this alliance excludes you right off
104,00:06:35.08,00:06:35.08,"the bat. >> Well, you know..."
105,00:06:38.04,00:06:38.04,>> What happens when the merger comes with the men?
106,00:06:42.00,00:06:42.00,>> ( sighs ) >> How do you keep your
107,00:06:44.00,00:06:44.00,"face and-and say, ""You know what?"
108,00:06:45.75,00:06:45.75,"I'm sticking with the women?"" And what about the guys back"
109,00:06:47.46,00:06:47.46,home? >> You... What do you mean?
110,00:06:49.04,00:06:49.04,What do you... what do you...?
111,00:06:50.12,00:06:50.12,"What-what...? What do you mean, what about"
112,00:06:52.17,00:06:52.17,the guys back home? >> Don't cuss at me.
113,00:06:54.71,00:06:54.71,">> What do you mean? >> Well, don't cuss at me."
114,00:06:56.42,00:06:56.42,>> Then don't treat me like I'm  some sort of lackey.
115,00:06:58.88,00:06:58.88,"What you want is your playing me, and you want me to continue"
116,00:07:01.96,00:07:01.96,"doing all the work, and 110%... >> I don't want you to do"
117,00:07:03.71,00:07:03.71,anything. >> Rory...
118,00:07:04.83,00:07:04.83,">> Sit and your butt and have a good time with it, Rory."
119,00:07:06.50,00:07:06.50,">> Rory, we're not playing it off..."
120,00:07:07.83,00:07:07.83,">> I've already told you, just like I told you on the"
121,00:07:10.08,00:07:10.08,"trail yesterday, that I would support you 120%."
122,00:07:13.46,00:07:13.46,I don't give a ... about Sarge.
123,00:07:15.42,00:07:15.42,I don't give a ... about Chad. I don't know them men.
124,00:07:18.25,00:07:18.25,Who has been pumping this whole time?
125,00:07:20.50,00:07:20.50,">> Me, you. >> Right."
126,00:07:22.29,00:07:22.29,>> Yeah. Leann.
127,00:07:23.25,00:07:23.25,>> Right. >> Yeah.
128,00:07:24.58,00:07:24.58,>> And you can't say that about everybody on Yasur.
129,00:07:29.04,00:07:29.04,The ladies of Yasur have basically told me that I'm going
130,00:07:31.83,00:07:31.83,"to be the next one voted out. That's done a job on my head, so"
131,00:07:36.88,00:07:36.88,"I've decided that I will go into self-destruct mode, and one of"
132,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,the things that I discussed with my wife before I came out here
133,00:07:46.92,00:07:46.92,"was I am going to institute a slash, burn and salt the earth"
134,00:07:50.83,00:07:50.83,policy. What that means is if I get
135,00:07:54.12,00:07:54.12,"voted off this island, the Yasur tribe will burn."
136,00:07:58.25,00:07:58.25,"I can guarantee that. >> PROBST: What's going on,"
137,00:08:13.83,00:08:13.83,"guys?OBST: What's going on, >> Hey, Jeff."
138,00:08:17.04,00:08:17.04,>> PROBST: Getting your first look at the new Yasur tribe.

141,00:08:23.04,00:08:23.04,last Tribal Council. >> Not what we said.
142,00:08:25.79,00:08:25.79,"Not what we said. >> PROBST: Lopevi, a lot of"

145,00:08:32.12,00:08:32.12,">> Yeah, I thought for sure that they would get rid of"
146,00:08:35.00,00:08:35.00,"him, keep the women together. >> Wow, what can I say?"
147,00:08:39.96,00:08:39.96,>> PROBST: Okay. Let's get to today's challenge.
148,00:08:42.38,00:08:42.38,"It is for reward, and it will require a steady hand."
149,00:08:46.17,00:08:46.17,"On my go, one tribe member at a time is going to begin breaking"
150,00:08:49.21,00:08:49.21,coconuts. Once you've filled your coconut

152,00:08:54.17,00:08:54.17,"For the first stage, you got to make your way through a wood"
153,00:08:56.67,00:08:56.67,"crawl. Second stage, you'll go up and"
154,00:08:58.17,00:08:58.17,"over a see-saw. The third stage, you will high"

156,00:09:03.42,00:09:03.42,"Fourth stage: another see-saw, and the final stage, you'll"
157,00:09:06.54,00:09:06.54,"crawl through the bamboo cage. When you reach the end, you'll"
158,00:09:10.08,00:09:10.08,pour the juice remaining in your coconut shell into a hand-blown
159,00:09:13.00,00:09:13.00,"glass jar. The jars are not identical, but"
160,00:09:16.38,00:09:16.38,the black lines designate an equal amount.
161,00:09:19.21,00:09:19.21,If you spill all of your juice while you're on the obstacle
162,00:09:21.75,00:09:21.75,"course, you come back and you go to the back of the line."

187,00:10:27.62,00:10:27.62,John on the course. Both in the first obstacle.

380,00:20:21.92,00:20:21.92,that? >> They have approached
381,00:20:23.12,00:20:23.12,you to be one of the final four? >> Have they done it to
382,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,you? ( laughter )
383,00:20:31.71,00:20:31.71,"Yeah, so... I knew they were."
384,00:20:35.08,00:20:35.08,">> They're playing it, ain't they?"
385,00:20:36.42,00:20:36.42,>> Yeah. >> Sarge told me that
386,00:20:39.21,00:20:39.21,Chris and I and Sarge and Chad would be the final four.
387,00:20:43.33,00:20:43.33,They turned around and they told Julie the same exact thing.
388,00:20:46.38,00:20:46.38,>> I just think the guys are going to shaft us whenever
389,00:20:49.54,00:20:49.54,"they get a chance, no matter what they sit there and say to"
390,00:20:52.04,00:20:52.04,us. >> I figured they was
391,00:20:53.96,00:20:53.96,"playing us. >> Yeah, of course they] are."
392,00:20:56.50,00:20:56.50,I approached Twila and I kind of threw out a little reverse
393,00:20:59.75,00:20:59.75,"psychology, and she indeed said they had, you know, promised her"
394,00:21:03.25,00:21:03.25,"final four, and so I said they did me also,"
395,00:21:05.71,00:21:05.71,"but they hadn't, so it completely turned her off to"
396,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,"them, and now I have her on my side currently."
397,00:21:11.25,00:21:11.25,"I mean, I don't have any loyalties to the women."
398,00:21:13.08,00:21:13.08,">> I don't either. Between the two of us, we've got"
399,00:21:16.21,00:21:16.21,"to stay on the guys' side, but they're worried now because the"
400,00:21:19.17,00:21:19.17,"number of the women are up. >> Oh, of course."
401,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,"All right, so, we are pretty much pretending we're their"
402,00:21:25.08,00:21:25.08,pawns. >> Yes.
403,00:21:27.04,00:21:27.04,>> But little do they know.
404,00:21:29.04,00:21:29.04,"Me and Twila have a rocky relationship, but now, I guess,"
405,00:21:31.83,00:21:31.83,she's the only one that I'm definitely concrete with that
406,00:21:34.67,00:21:34.67,I have a plan. And I weaseled my way back in
407,00:21:37.12,00:21:37.12,"because I knew that she was getting sucked in with the guys,"
408,00:21:40.29,00:21:40.29,"so my plan worked, for right now."
409,00:21:44.54,00:21:44.54,I guess this is our pact then to each other.
410,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,>> You're gonna have to have somebody to depend on.
411,00:21:50.12,00:21:50.12,>> Right. >> That you can honestly depend
412,00:21:52.08,00:21:52.08,on. >> And it's so unlikely to be
413,00:21:54.67,00:21:54.67,us. >> Tree mail.
414,00:22:07.12,00:22:07.12,>> We got mail. We've got mail.
415,00:22:11.04,00:22:11.04,">> Toys to play with. ""Practice, practice, practice."
416,00:22:15.04,00:22:15.04,"Each of you has to shoot, for one who performs poorly tonight"
417,00:22:18.83,00:22:18.83,"will get the boot."" Look."
418,00:22:20.96,00:22:20.96,"We just got some tree mail, and it's a sack of marbles and a"
419,00:22:25.12,00:22:25.12,slingshot. We're a little scared.
420,00:22:27.71,00:22:27.71,"If we lose, there's always a possibility to go home."
421,00:22:30.21,00:22:30.21,"That's the downfall, and it's definitely an option I could be"
422,00:22:33.00,00:22:33.00,going home tonight. >> Whatever way you hold
423,00:22:34.92,00:22:34.92,"it, that's the way we held it as kids."
424,00:22:36.12,00:22:36.12,>> I never had one. >> Oh.
425,00:22:37.83,00:22:37.83,"If you're right-handed, you want to pull with the hand that you"
426,00:22:40.62,00:22:40.62,"normally are, 'cause you're aiming like this."
427,00:22:42.83,00:22:42.83,"Looks like we're going back to the boys' town, back to the days"
428,00:22:45.92,00:22:45.92,of knocking out windows and stuff.
429,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,"I mean, there's no question who is going to win the challenge"
430,00:22:50.08,00:22:50.08,"today, I mean, Lopevi. Yasur is like a high school team"
431,00:22:52.71,00:22:52.71,"against, you know, an SEC team. Uh, there's no comparison."
432,00:22:55.67,00:22:55.67,"They're gonna give us a run for our money, but they won't win."
433,00:22:59.75,00:22:59.75,">> Oh, okay. >> Not too shabby."
434,00:23:02.21,00:23:02.21,>> I've been a threat since day one.
435,00:23:04.54,00:23:04.54,"Everyone's already told me that, so right now it's strictly a"
436,00:23:07.92,00:23:07.92,game-based game for me. The strategy can wait until
437,00:23:10.25,00:23:10.25,later. Right now it's strictly I need
438,00:23:12.08,00:23:12.08,"to win the immunities, because I do not want to go to Tribal"
439,00:23:15.92,00:23:15.92,Council. >> Let's get ready to
440,00:23:19.33,00:23:19.33,"rumble! Introducing, the ladies of"
441,00:23:26.50,00:23:26.50,"Yasur, plus one. I feel so fabulous today, I can"
442,00:23:31.04,00:23:31.04,"only speak for myself, but I am at high rev already this"
443,00:23:34.92,00:23:34.92,morning. Perhaps it's the three cups of
444,00:23:38.00,00:23:38.00,coffee that I've had this morning already.
445,00:23:40.29,00:23:40.29,"( laughs ) I'm ready to run over there,"
446,00:23:42.92,00:23:42.92,quite frankly. This is just for direction and
447,00:23:45.08,00:23:45.08,aim. >> Hey.
448,00:23:49.08,00:23:49.08,>> That was a good shot. This challenge is of the utmost
449,00:23:51.96,00:23:51.96,"importance for me because if we lose immunity challenge today,"
450,00:23:55.96,00:23:55.96,then I will be going home tonight.
451,00:24:03.25,00:24:03.25,>> PROBST: Come on in. All right.
452,00:24:11.67,00:24:11.67,Shall we get to today's challenge?
453,00:24:13.08,00:24:13.08,>> Let's do it. >> PROBST: First things first.
454,00:24:16.38,00:24:16.38,"Give it up, Chris. Immunity back up for grabs."
455,00:24:23.71,00:24:23.71,"This morning in tree mail, you received a slingshot."
456,00:24:26.67,00:24:26.67,I hope you practiced with it. Here's how the challenge is
457,00:24:29.42,00:24:29.42,"gonna work. One tribe member at a time,"
458,00:24:31.12,00:24:31.12,you're going to attempt to break your tribe-colored ceramic tiles
459,00:24:34.12,00:24:34.12,hanging on the grid. A tile's considered broken when
460,00:24:37.12,00:24:37.12,no piece is connected to more than two wires.
461,00:24:39.88,00:24:39.88,Each of you will randomly be assigned a lane on the matching
462,00:24:43.21,00:24:43.21,"game board. Each time you break a tile,"
463,00:24:46.42,00:24:46.42,you'll flip over the corresponding wooden tile on the
464,00:24:49.58,00:24:49.58,"game board, so once you've knocked out any given column of"
465,00:24:53.04,00:24:53.04,ceramic tiles you will have flipped over the corresponding
466,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,"wooden tiles on the game board, and the tribe member in that"
467,00:24:58.46,00:24:58.46,column will move off the board to the finish mat.
468,00:25:00.75,00:25:00.75,"Once you're on the mat, you're no longer a shooter."

474,00:25:15.38,00:25:15.38,"behind the game board, wait for my go."
475,00:25:21.96,00:25:21.96,"All right, first shooters up. Rory and Chad."

562,00:30:52.17,00:30:52.17,"She could have had me as a tight-tight friend, and she"
563,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,"could have eliminated me and knocked me out the game, and"
564,00:30:59.17,00:30:59.17,she failed to take advantage of both those opportunities.
565,00:31:03.04,00:31:03.04,Now she's number one on my hit list.
566,00:31:04.88,00:31:04.88,">> Rory was a rock star. >> Rory, you were unbelievable."
567,00:31:10.12,00:31:10.12,">> I told you this morning when I was shooting that thing,"
568,00:31:12.54,00:31:12.54,"I was, like, damn! I hit the tiki three times out"
569,00:31:14.46,00:31:14.46,of four. >> Rory got a little cocky
570,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,"with his winnings, as he well should."
571,00:31:18.21,00:31:18.21,"Otherwise he'd be going home, you know?"
572,00:31:20.50,00:31:20.50,"He's earned that right. So I'm really glad that we won,"
573,00:31:23.79,00:31:23.79,"but at the same time I looked over at Lopevi, right, as soon"
574,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,"as we won, and I looked at Julie, and it hurt."
575,00:31:30.04,00:31:30.04,It hurt to know that either Julie or Twila are going home
576,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,tonight. >> We lost the challenge
577,00:31:59.17,00:31:59.17,"today, and we're going to Tribal Council."
578,00:32:01.79,00:32:01.79,"Today was the foundation, the basis of the rest of the game"
579,00:32:07.08,00:32:07.08,"for us, but losing today meant it's equal to them, 5-5."
580,00:32:10.83,00:32:10.83,The strategy of the game has changed now.
581,00:32:13.08,00:32:13.08,It could go anywhere. >> I'm not confident
582,00:32:15.38,00:32:15.38,"Julie's staying with us, dude. If we merge, she's going right"
583,00:32:18.00,00:32:18.00,with the women. >> Julie said to me
584,00:32:21.00,00:32:21.00,"earlier this afternoon, she'd like to get rid of John."
585,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,">> Well, yeah, there you go. See, she's thinking it's her"
586,00:32:27.46,00:32:27.46,"turn, man. If we merge, John's gone, she's"
587,00:32:30.04,00:32:30.04,"with the women, we're gone. Trust in this game is huge, and"
588,00:32:34.75,00:32:34.75,"at this stage, it's even bigger, because there's more at stake."
589,00:32:38.75,00:32:38.75,"John, I don't trust, and Julie-- I don't believe that she would"
590,00:32:42.62,00:32:42.62,definitely stay with Lopevi if we merge.
591,00:32:45.38,00:32:45.38,"As much as I don't want to keep John around, if we keep John and"
592,00:32:48.29,00:32:48.29,"Julie goes next, we've got the guys."
593,00:32:50.62,00:32:50.62,>> John has been a target to send home ever since the game
594,00:32:54.50,00:32:54.50,"started. I mean, he was on the other side"
595,00:32:56.62,00:32:56.62,"with the guys, but Chad's concerned that maybe keeping"
596,00:33:00.25,00:33:00.25,John around a little bit longer might be the best thing.
597,00:33:03.71,00:33:03.71,He doesn't have a whole lot of trust in Julie.
598,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,">> It's up in the air, man, with John."
599,00:33:08.83,00:33:08.83,I don't know. If-if I'm convinced that Julie's
600,00:33:10.71,00:33:10.71,"with us, then we can get rid of John, but, I mean, otherwise,"
601,00:33:13.29,00:33:13.29,it's a male-female thing. The women's going to be a huge
602,00:33:16.21,00:33:16.21,"enticement for her to go over. Man, she's..."
603,00:33:18.79,00:33:18.79,I can tell she's... >> I don't think they're
604,00:33:20.38,00:33:20.38,"so much women, or they wouldn't have voted off Lisa."
605,00:33:22.67,00:33:22.67,I don't think they're hung up on just the women.
606,00:33:26.21,00:33:26.21,>> ( sighs ) It's going to be tough.
607,00:33:29.04,00:33:29.04,It's not solid anymore right now.
608,00:33:50.00,00:33:50.00,">> What does Chad say, anything?"
609,00:33:52.00,00:33:52.00,>> Sometimes I don't know where Chad's coming from.
610,00:33:55.00,00:33:55.00,"Every time, it doesn't matter how much you talk to him, you"
611,00:33:57.17,00:33:57.17,still go to Tribal Council with doubt.
612,00:33:59.42,00:33:59.42,">> In my tribe, I don't trust anyone."
613,00:34:01.21,00:34:01.21,"I can't trust anyone, but I have to at least put my faith in one"
614,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"person, and I do with Chris, because I think me and Chris can"
615,00:34:08.08,00:34:08.08,really do some damage when it comes down to the...
616,00:34:10.25,00:34:10.25,to the dwindling of-of both tribes.
617,00:34:13.21,00:34:13.21,">> Just off the top of your head, if we was leaving"
618,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,"right now, who would you want to vote for?"
619,00:34:17.17,00:34:17.17,">> See, the thing is, I'd say Julie, but I really"
620,00:34:19.42,00:34:19.42,"don't think she'd vote on the girls' side, so I think she's an"
621,00:34:22.00,00:34:22.00,"asset to have later on. And I think with-with Chad, he"
622,00:34:25.04,00:34:25.04,"gets the sympathy vote. Sounds bad, but it's true, you"
623,00:34:27.62,00:34:27.62,know? >> I'm coming to grips with...
624,00:34:30.08,00:34:30.08,"You know, I understand what you're saying."
625,00:34:32.08,00:34:32.08,>> If it ever came down to him and one of us in the
626,00:34:34.21,00:34:34.21,"finals, final two, he'd get it in a..."
627,00:34:35.96,00:34:35.96,"in a heartbeat, because, you know..."
628,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,"I thought of Chad since day one, because he's type of guy that"
629,00:34:41.21,00:34:41.21,"just gets by every time; not just gets by on the vote, but"
630,00:34:45.33,00:34:45.33,just gets by without anyone noticing him.
631,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,"And Chad can seriously get some sympathy points, which he's"
632,00:34:50.21,00:34:50.21,"great at, because he does have one leg, and he's doing amazing,"
633,00:34:52.83,00:34:52.83,"but we can't handle any sympathy points against us, so he's got"
634,00:34:56.83,00:34:56.83,to go now. What's up with you guys?
635,00:35:00.96,00:35:00.96,">> Stacking some wood, boy. >> Oh, yeah?"
636,00:35:03.33,00:35:03.33,>> What are you doing? >> Wondering which one of
637,00:35:05.38,00:35:05.38,us is going home tonight. >> That's what I came
638,00:35:07.46,00:35:07.46,to tell you. Chad.
639,00:35:10.04,00:35:10.04,">> So, you want Chad tonight? >> Yeah, Chad tonight."
640,00:35:12.00,00:35:12.00,>> It's not going to be me or her?
641,00:35:13.17,00:35:13.17,>> It's not going... I swear on my life that it's not
642,00:35:14.79,00:35:14.79,"you two. >> Go ahead, hon."
643,00:35:15.83,00:35:15.83,I'll be there later. >> But me-me and Chris
644,00:35:17.38,00:35:17.38,"are being seriously true on this, and we just think we-we"
645,00:35:21.17,00:35:21.17,could all be tighter with this group.
646,00:35:23.17,00:35:23.17,">> Julie, are you comfortable with that-- voting off Chad?"
647,00:35:26.21,00:35:26.21,">> Depends on, uh, Sarge, right, if he's down?"
648,00:35:28.92,00:35:28.92,">> Yeah. >> Well, even if Sarge"
649,00:35:30.25,00:35:30.25,"isn't, that means it's everyone against..."
650,00:35:31.92,00:35:31.92,">> Oh, three against... >> It would be..."
651,00:35:33.04,00:35:33.04,it'd be us four against Chad.
652,00:35:34.54,00:35:34.54,">> Yeah, us four. I take Twila's word, 'cause she"
653,00:35:36.46,00:35:36.46,"is a rough redneck, and to me, all rough rednecks that I have"
654,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00,"met are pretty loyal. At this point, everyone could be"
655,00:35:48.12,00:35:48.12,"completely playing everyone, so people are either going with"
656,00:35:50.75,00:35:50.75,"what I said, or people are going to vote me off, so I-I can't"
657,00:35:53.75,00:35:53.75,"stress enough that tonight is the night-- for me, anyways-- to"
658,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,figure out where I stand in this game.
659,00:36:20.12,00:36:20.12,>> PROBST: Welcome to Tribal Council.
660,00:36:21.62,00:36:21.62,Haven't seen you guys in a while.
661,00:36:22.67,00:36:22.67,">> Yup. >> PROBST: So, Chris, everything"
662,00:36:24.71,00:36:24.71,"seemed to be going so well for Lopevi, and then out of nowhere,"
663,00:36:27.92,00:36:27.92,back-to-back losses. What happened?
664,00:36:30.62,00:36:30.62,">> I don't know. You know, it seemed like when,"
665,00:36:32.25,00:36:32.25,"you know, we-we-we-we went on four wins in a row."
666,00:36:35.42,00:36:35.42,It seemed like we were dominating.
667,00:36:37.25,00:36:37.25,"It didn't even seem like it was close, but today, it was close."
668,00:36:39.58,00:36:39.58,"I mean, you know, they-they beat us by a couple, uh, but that's"
669,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,"all it takes, and that's why we're here and they're not."
670,00:36:45.08,00:36:45.08,">> PROBST: So, Chad, what was the reaction when you got back"
671,00:36:47.38,00:36:47.38,to camp? You guys haven't had to
672,00:36:48.71,00:36:48.71,contemplate voting somebody out in a long time.
673,00:36:51.04,00:36:51.04,>> Right. When we are
674,00:36:52.12,00:36:52.12,"going off to do our little wood gathering and pot scrubbing,"
675,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,"you're aware of who's going with who, and if you're alone, or"
676,00:36:59.08,00:36:59.08,"maybe you shouldn't be alone, and, you know, so there's a lot"
677,00:37:02.25,00:37:02.25,"of posturing going on, you know. We're scrambling here before,"
678,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,"uh, Tribal Council. >> PROBST: Chris, does everybody"
679,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,have a role in this tribe? >> I think to a certain
680,00:37:10.62,00:37:10.62,"degree, yeah, everybody's got a role."
681,00:37:12.08,00:37:12.08,"Um, everybody does something that benefits the tribe during"
682,00:37:16.17,00:37:16.17,the day. There's always a time when we're
683,00:37:18.62,00:37:18.62,"going to need to eat, and, uh, we're going to need firewood,"
684,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,and there's always someone willing to step up and do that.
685,00:37:23.83,00:37:23.83,"I think it's a team effort. >> PROBST: Sarge, what does"
686,00:37:26.71,00:37:26.71,"Twila do well? >> Um, Twila is the, uh,"
687,00:37:30.46,00:37:30.46,"wonder for, um, exotic foods. She is the preparer of meals,"
688,00:37:36.21,00:37:36.21,and she's constantly going to get firewood.
689,00:37:38.79,00:37:38.79,She-she just... she does
690,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,"everything. >> PROBST: John, what could"
691,00:37:41.54,00:37:41.54,"Twila do better? >> Um, the thing with Twila is,"
692,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,she really is the workhorse. Her and Sarge are the two
693,00:37:47.79,00:37:47.79,"workhorses. Um, as far as do better, I would"
694,00:37:49.79,00:37:49.79,love to see her take naps. I would...
695,00:37:53.04,00:37:53.04,I would love it. I would not feel distressed
696,00:37:54.46,00:37:54.46,"around camp if I saw Twila say, ""Hey, let's kick back and take a"
697,00:37:57.58,00:37:57.58,"nap,"" 'cause I'm the number one napper go-going."
698,00:38:00.38,00:38:00.38,"I mean, I like taking naps, and- and I never see her take little"
699,00:38:02.96,00:38:02.96,"catnaps ever. >> PROBST: So, if you look over,"
700,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,"and you see the workhorse never taking a nap, how do you ever"
701,00:38:07.96,00:38:07.96,justify taking a nap? >> I thank you very much.
702,00:38:10.12,00:38:10.12,>> Because... because whenever-whenever something...
703,00:38:12.46,00:38:12.46,"I'm asked to do anything, I-I will do it."
704,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,"We all do our roles. I mean, I-I might take more"
705,00:38:16.96,00:38:16.96,"naps, but she could take naps, too."
706,00:38:18.92,00:38:18.92,It's-it's okay to take a nap. That's the thing.
707,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,We don't always need to be working.
708,00:38:22.58,00:38:22.58,">> PROBST: So, Chad, tell me about life at camp, because"
709,00:38:25.88,00:38:25.88,"you're living with these people, but you are competing against"
710,00:38:29.21,00:38:29.21,them. How do you know if you're
711,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,getting to know somebody well or being played?
712,00:38:34.00,00:38:34.00,>> I think that there's a... there's a very good general
713,00:38:36.08,00:38:36.08,first impression and a good way of someone perceiving someone
714,00:38:39.33,00:38:39.33,"else that gets down to the core level who that person is, and if"
715,00:38:42.75,00:38:42.75,you feel like you're perceptive enough that you can get to that
716,00:38:45.67,00:38:45.67,"core level quickly, then I think can you trust them, unless"
717,00:38:49.08,00:38:49.08,they're of someone who's completely manipulative and
718,00:38:51.21,00:38:51.21,someone that can... >> PROBST: Imagine that in this
719,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,game. >> ...that can lie and
720,00:38:54.08,00:38:54.08,"cheat very well, but I feel like I can pick up on that."
721,00:38:57.00,00:38:57.00,"I really do. >> PROBST: Julie, think this"
722,00:38:59.25,00:38:59.25,"tribe trusts you? >> Well, the time spent"
723,00:39:01.58,00:39:01.58,"together has been very telling, and, um, I think we've gelled"
724,00:39:04.29,00:39:04.29,"really well, especially with winning, and it is just a matter"
725,00:39:07.88,00:39:07.88,of meshing well and the energies put together.
726,00:39:10.17,00:39:10.17,"And, um, there has been doubt and there probably still is, but"
727,00:39:12.62,00:39:12.62,"hopefully, you know, even with this vote, um, the proof will be"
728,00:39:16.42,00:39:16.42,"there. >> PROBST: Chris, what are you"
729,00:39:18.92,00:39:18.92,"basing your vote on? >> Um, I'm basing..."
730,00:39:20.62,00:39:20.62,I'm basing my vote on a couple things.
731,00:39:22.75,00:39:22.75,"First of all, I'm basing my-my vote on trust."
732,00:39:25.04,00:39:25.04,"Trust is hard to come by in this game, and sometimes, you think"
733,00:39:27.62,00:39:27.62,"you have it, and-and you turn around, and that wink or that"
734,00:39:31.04,00:39:31.04,nod kind of puts that trust in doubt.
735,00:39:33.08,00:39:33.08,"Um, I'm also basing my-my vote on my future in the game, who's"
736,00:39:37.00,00:39:37.00,"going to benefit me or benefit the people that, you know, I'm"
737,00:39:40.12,00:39:40.12,playing the game with or aligned with.
738,00:39:42.58,00:39:42.58,">> PROBST: With that, it is time to vote."
739,00:39:45.21,00:39:45.21,"Sarge, you're up. >> I'm afraid you might"
740,00:40:06.58,00:40:06.58,"sneak by some more, and I need you to go."
741,00:40:29.00,00:40:29.00,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
742,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
743,00:40:46.17,00:40:46.17,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
744,00:40:48.33,00:40:48.33,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
745,00:40:51.92,00:40:51.92,First vote: John. Chad.
746,00:40:59.29,00:40:59.29,"One vote John, one vote Chad. John."
