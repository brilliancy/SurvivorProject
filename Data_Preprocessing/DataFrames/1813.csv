25,00:01:55.29,00:01:55.29,against Debbie to save me.And it would have been very easy
26,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,"to vote me out.You know, I know I'm a"
27,00:02:00.75,00:02:00.75,"dangerous player in this game,and so I'm-I'm just shocked."
28,00:02:05.25,00:02:05.25,"Thanks for protecting me.>> I mean, it was..."
29,00:02:08.96,00:02:08.96,>> Holy cow!So what's the lesson in this?
30,00:02:12.12,00:02:12.12,I think that the game is stillbeing played with truth.
31,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,I think the game is still beingplayed with honesty.
32,00:02:18.25,00:02:18.25,And I think this is the firsttime in this game that I'm
33,00:02:23.96,00:02:23.96,almost speechless.Almost.

37,00:02:36.54,00:02:36.54,"Just tell me when I'm going.Because obviously, Coach Wade's"
38,00:02:39.42,00:02:39.42,"no longer in control of thisgame, and I don't know what's"
39,00:02:42.96,00:02:42.96,"going to happen next.I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

48,00:04:16.50,00:04:16.50,You looked ruined yesterday.>> I feel like I scarred my
49,00:04:18.75,00:04:18.75,lungs yesterday.And my lungs feel like I smoked
50,00:04:26.25,00:04:26.25,20 cigars in a row yesterday andinhaled all of them.
51,00:04:29.83,00:04:29.83,"But, I mean, like, for me, it'swhatever you guys want."
52,00:04:32.21,00:04:32.21,I was talking to the guys aboutExile.
53,00:04:34.62,00:04:34.62,And I don't want to go to Exile.Nobody wants to go to Exile at
54,00:04:37.04,00:04:37.04,this point.I just hope my asthma doesn't
55,00:04:40.96,00:04:40.96,play up.That's a horrible excuse.
56,00:04:43.62,00:04:43.62,"You know, that's my only fear.I'm just making it out here."
57,00:04:47.17,00:04:47.17,This asthma is kicking my ass.My back is killing me every day.
58,00:04:50.42,00:04:50.42,So how do I handle thatadversity?
59,00:04:53.12,00:04:53.12,">> So what do you think, Coach?>> You know what I think is"
60,00:04:56.75,00:04:56.75,the-the noble thing is that wesend J.T. or myself.
61,00:05:00.88,00:05:00.88,"But the cold, calculatingcompetitor in me wants to send"
62,00:05:08.50,00:05:08.50,Taj or Erinn.It's really up to you guys what
63,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,you think.I just want to all be on the
64,00:05:13.25,00:05:13.25,"same page.>> Oh, God! I mean, J.T. and I"
65,00:05:16.46,00:05:16.46,are eager to send Coach toExile.
66,00:05:18.58,00:05:18.58,He has been so skittish aboutit.
67,00:05:21.79,00:05:21.79,He has been selling outeveryone trying to get them to
68,00:05:24.04,00:05:24.04,"go to Exile before him.I mean, you know, Coach has"
69,00:05:26.58,00:05:26.58,"mentioned ailments, you know, aback problem, asthma, but it"
70,00:05:30.08,00:05:30.08,never seemed to really affecthis performance.
71,00:05:33.12,00:05:33.12,So I'm not entirely sure Coachcan build a fire and cook this
72,00:05:36.08,00:05:36.08,food by himself.I don't know.
73,00:05:39.12,00:05:39.12,I think he's scared.Do you want to just tell him?
74,00:05:41.50,00:05:41.50,>> Huh?>> You want to just tell him
75,00:05:43.46,00:05:43.46,we're sending him to Exile?>> Doesn't matter.
76,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,"Coach, he's just really scaredto go to Exile."
77,00:05:55.12,00:05:55.12,Such an adventurous soul asCoach shouldn't really be scared
78,00:05:57.88,00:05:57.88,"to go to Exile.So I'm ready to test him, and"
79,00:06:01.25,00:06:01.25,also we plan on sendingCoach home at the next Tribal

155,00:11:10.17,00:11:10.17,I'm just gonna meditate.>> He's going to take the martyr
156,00:11:12.54,00:11:12.54,"approach, so when he comes backhe can not have eaten, not have"
157,00:11:16.50,00:11:16.50,"slept, not have had any water,to-- minimizing the experiences"
158,00:11:20.67,00:11:20.67,"of some, I feel like-- and havean excuse when he doesn't win"
159,00:11:24.08,00:11:24.08,immunity when he gets back.>> That's pretty harsh.
160,00:11:26.54,00:11:26.54,>> Kind of how I feel. Sorry.>> PROBST: Is there something
161,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,to what Erinn said about maybetrying to put yourself in the
162,00:11:31.21,00:11:31.21,position so that you've had theworst experience at Exile?
163,00:11:34.79,00:11:34.79,">> I want it to be tough on me,that's for sure."
164,00:11:37.54,00:11:37.54,I'm not going to minimizeeverybody's experience.
165,00:11:39.38,00:11:39.38,"In fact, I'm disappointedthat Erinn would say that."
166,00:11:41.38,00:11:41.38,"You know, since the beginningof the game she wanted to"
167,00:11:43.25,00:11:43.25,"try to, uh, cut me down alittle bit and a lot of"
168,00:11:45.54,00:11:45.54,times when people do that it'sto vault themselves over.
169,00:11:47.92,00:11:47.92,I think maybe she wants to leavehere with the toughest Exile
170,00:11:50.12,00:11:50.12,experience.And I don't want to take that
171,00:11:52.04,00:11:52.04,away from her.As far as coming back and
172,00:11:54.00,00:11:54.00,"winning immunity, my body isabout this close right now"
173,00:11:57.25,00:11:57.25,"from, uh, total disaster.I've got, uh, disks on the right"
174,00:12:02.25,00:12:02.25,side that have ruptured.I feel my left one is about
175,00:12:04.58,00:12:04.58,ready to slip.My asthma is choking me up so
176,00:12:06.96,00:12:06.96,bad I can't breathe. There's no excuse about if I win
177,00:12:10.04,00:12:10.04,immunity or if I don't winimmunity.
178,00:12:12.21,00:12:12.21,"I make no excuses.So, you know, you can throw"
179,00:12:15.21,00:12:15.21,"stones at me, you can, everybodyelse can and I go like this."
180,00:12:17.75,00:12:17.75,"Give me your best shot.Hit me with your best shot, Pat"
181,00:12:20.54,00:12:20.54,"Benatar, doesn't matter to me.>> PROBST: All right, Coach,"
182,00:12:23.21,00:12:23.21,grab your personal items.Head out.
183,00:12:27.46,00:12:27.46,Coach will return in time forthe next immunity challenge.
184,00:12:30.25,00:12:30.25,">> I bit you guys adieu.>> Thank you, Coach."
185,00:12:33.46,00:12:33.46,">> PROBST: All right, J.T.,let's get to the reward."

189,00:12:48.42,00:12:48.42,only person that took me-- Iguess Stephen.

197,00:13:07.04,00:13:07.04,Erinn had to try to rub it inhis face.
198,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,"I mean, she's just shootingherself in the foot."
199,00:13:12.79,00:13:12.79,"People are so dumb in this game.I mean, they talk way too much."
200,00:13:15.75,00:13:15.75,"So, it's going to hurt her andnot me."

205,00:13:48.00,00:13:48.00,good time.I'm not worried about it at all.
206,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,I feel very confident in myalliance with Stephen and J.T.

209,00:13:59.83,00:13:59.83,nothing else.I'm feeling a little guilty.
210,00:14:04.17,00:14:04.17,>> Why?>> About what I said.
211,00:14:06.75,00:14:06.75,It was not an appropriate venueto say that.
212,00:14:09.21,00:14:09.21,"Like, it's a conversation Iprobably should have had with"
213,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,"him.>> No, no. He's a jerk."
214,00:14:14.25,00:14:14.25,"He's a jerk.To say, ""I'm not going to eat."""
215,00:14:16.58,00:14:16.58,Give me a break.You're sitting here suffering
216,00:14:19.21,00:14:19.21,"from asthma, a broken disk, thisand that, and you're not going"

219,00:14:26.17,00:14:26.17,I'm so ready to send his asshome.
220,00:14:28.04,00:14:28.04,">> I know, me, too, but...>> And you know what kills me?"
221,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,"He's talking all this smackabout how he's so broken down,"
222,00:14:32.96,00:14:32.96,but he was perfectly fine whenhe was on J.T.'s heels.
223,00:14:35.46,00:14:35.46,"Had he won, the ""warrior"" wouldhave been back."
224,00:14:37.17,00:14:37.17,">> Oh, I know, I know.Yeah, I just, I don't"
225,00:14:39.33,00:14:39.33,understand the man.I don't understand his motives.
226,00:14:42.17,00:14:42.17,"I would hate, hate, hate foranything that I said today to"
227,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,send me home before him.>> Don't worry yourself.
228,00:14:48.75,00:14:48.75,Please don't worry.>> Okay.
229,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,>> Do not worry.>> My strategy definitely is to
230,00:14:53.04,00:14:53.04,go as far as I can with J.T.and Stephen.
231,00:14:56.62,00:14:56.62,I would hate for anything I saidto have changed the way that
232,00:15:00.25,00:15:00.25,"Stephen and J.T. view me, butthis is really the time where"
233,00:15:03.46,00:15:03.46,you do start to get reallyparanoid about this stuff.
234,00:15:40.71,00:15:40.71,(bird screeches)>> This is going to be like a
235,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,vacation for me.A little sun tan out here...
236,00:15:54.42,00:15:54.42,All those wishy-washy people atcamp with no character. Phew!
237,00:16:01.96,00:16:01.96,Coach Wade's foundation is builton a rock.
238,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,"Inside here...Unbreakable, unbending,"
239,00:16:12.25,00:16:12.25,"unyielding, immeasurable,immovable, invincible."
240,00:16:18.58,00:16:18.58,Staying out here for a weekwithout any food will only
241,00:16:23.25,00:16:23.25,"make me a better, strongerperson."
242,00:16:25.21,00:16:25.21,"Those guys won't be able to getold Coach Wade down, I'll tell"
243,00:16:27.71,00:16:27.71,you that.I will not have anything to eat.
244,00:16:31.67,00:16:31.67,It's going to be like theancient American Indians that
245,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,are my ancestors.They used to go out into the
246,00:16:36.46,00:16:36.46,wilderness for 48 hours andthey would commune with the
247,00:16:39.46,00:16:39.46,creator of the universe and theywould become men.
248,00:16:43.83,00:16:43.83,"Well, I'm already a man.So, this will just make me more"
249,00:16:46.12,00:16:46.12,"of a man, but this is going tobe an adventure."
250,00:16:48.88,00:16:48.88,Thank you for creating me as anindividual.
251,00:16:52.38,00:16:52.38,I ask that you would help me toforgive Erinn as she's back at
252,00:16:55.00,00:16:55.00,camp thinking negative thoughtsabout me.
253,00:17:00.21,00:17:00.21,"At the challenge, Erinn said,""Well, I think Coach is just"
254,00:17:02.71,00:17:02.71,"being a martyr.""But I just let her have it."
255,00:17:06.62,00:17:06.62,Dragon slayer makes his dragoncane.
256,00:17:09.25,00:17:09.25,Whether it's because I'mspeaking such truth that nobody
257,00:17:12.71,00:17:12.71,"can deny it or because I'm soeloquent, whatever the case, I"
258,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,got the last word.And I hope she goes home next.
259,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,She's certainly going to get myvote.
260,00:17:22.50,00:17:22.50,"Coach Wade's body might befailing him in many ways, but"
261,00:17:26.08,00:17:26.08,Coach Wade still has what ittakes to outlast anybody out
262,00:17:29.67,00:17:29.67,"here in this environment.Period, paragraph."
263,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,">> Oh, man!>> Oh, wow."
264,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,"This is how I like to travel.>> When I woke up this morning,"
265,00:18:04.33,00:18:04.33,I never would have imagined I'dbe in a private plane.
266,00:18:07.17,00:18:07.17,>> Look at this.This is the freaking life.
267,00:18:09.12,00:18:09.12,>> This was the best reward Icould have possibly asked for.
268,00:18:12.12,00:18:12.12,"A private plane to, uh, thegovernor's retreat."
269,00:18:15.25,00:18:15.25,I just really soaked it up.That's always been a dream of
270,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,"mine, have a private plane andto be able to fly on one like"
271,00:18:21.12,00:18:21.12,"that, and it was really awesome.>> Ha-ha! Whoo!"

481,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,think that that definitelyplayed out today with J.T. and
482,00:34:05.21,00:34:05.21,myself.I was honored by the defeat and
483,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,the way that I went down.>> Stephen and I are leaning
484,00:34:10.96,00:34:10.96,towards Erinn.I know Erinn is going to vote

489,00:34:29.04,00:34:29.04,that she made the other day.It was unforgivable.
490,00:34:31.58,00:34:31.58,It's just her time to go.It's been her time to go for

499,00:34:54.08,00:34:54.08,>> I was really pissed off.When she went to Exile we were

501,00:34:57.92,00:34:57.92,"We weren't trying to kick her,because, you know, I mean--"
502,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,"I just thought it was, like, sotasteless and classless."
503,00:35:03.96,00:35:03.96,J.T. and I sat down with Coachand we reassured him that
504,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,the warrior alliance was good.Erinn was going home tonight.
505,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,And J.T. is going to vote forErinn because he feels like he

532,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,minimized the entire experiencethat the rest of us were having.

543,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,tougher time than me.But I had past experiences with
544,00:37:36.08,00:37:36.08,"which to draw on.Which made it easier for me,"
