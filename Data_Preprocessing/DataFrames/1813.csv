1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:03.67,00:00:03.67,Survivor-- >> People who don't play this
3,00:00:06.08,00:00:06.08,"game even half as bold as me, pisses me off."
4,00:00:10.58,00:00:10.58,>> PROBST: Coach thought he was in the driver's seat.
5,00:00:12.79,00:00:12.79,>> I think Taj has to go next. >> PROBST: But Debbie turned on
6,00:00:20.92,00:00:20.92,her old ally. >> It is not good for me to be
7,00:00:23.17,00:00:23.17,attached to Coach. People are tired of him.
8,00:00:25.04,00:00:25.04,"Okay, so he's going to think we're voting off Taj."
9,00:00:28.04,00:00:28.04,"I think we need to go ahead and get Coach out, but it has to be"
10,00:00:30.17,00:00:30.17,every single one of us writing it down.
11,00:00:33.12,00:00:33.12,>> PROBST: So the Jalapao three and Erinn decided Debbie was
12,00:00:35.29,00:00:35.29,"too dangerous to keep around. >> Yeah, she goes."
13,00:00:42.42,00:00:42.42,>> PROBST: Coach was clueless as he watched his longtime ally go
14,00:00:46.08,00:00:46.08,"home. Debbie, the tribe has spoken."
15,00:00:50.12,00:00:50.12,"Can Coach regain control? Five are left, who will be"
16,00:00:54.04,00:00:54.04,voted out tonight? >> I'm in shock.
17,00:01:15.12,00:01:15.12,"Tonight at Tribal, I thought I was the one going home when I"
18,00:01:17.12,00:01:17.12,"saw my name. And then it was Debbie, Debbie,"
19,00:01:20.12,00:01:20.12,Debbie. >> Coach.
20,00:01:22.12,00:01:22.12,">> Yes, sir? >> What?"
21,00:01:32.00,00:01:32.00,>> That's who wrote your name down.
22,00:01:34.33,00:01:34.33,>> I can't grasp that. I'm like... I'm like the lamb
23,00:01:38.42,00:01:38.42,"led to the slaughterhouse around here, that's what I feel like."
24,00:01:42.08,00:01:42.08,"Oh, my goodness. >> I was like, wow, J.T.,"
25,00:01:50.54,00:01:50.54,Erinn and Taj and Stephen mounted a counterattack
26,00:01:55.29,00:01:55.29,against Debbie to save me. And it would have been very easy
27,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,"to vote me out. You know, I know I'm a"
28,00:02:00.75,00:02:00.75,"dangerous player in this game, and so I'm-I'm just shocked."
29,00:02:05.25,00:02:05.25,"Thanks for protecting me. >> I mean, it was..."
30,00:02:08.96,00:02:08.96,>> Holy cow! So what's the lesson in this?
31,00:02:12.12,00:02:12.12,I think that the game is still being played with truth.
32,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,I think the game is still being played with honesty.
33,00:02:18.25,00:02:18.25,And I think this is the first time in this game that I'm
34,00:02:23.96,00:02:23.96,almost speechless. Almost.
35,00:02:28.38,00:02:28.38,>> Sorry to lay that one on you before bed.
36,00:02:31.25,00:02:31.25,>> Yeah. >> Now I just want to talk to
37,00:02:33.71,00:02:33.71,J.T. and Stephen and just ask them when am I going?
38,00:02:36.54,00:02:36.54,"Just tell me when I'm going. Because obviously, Coach Wade's"
39,00:02:39.42,00:02:39.42,"no longer in control of this game, and I don't know what's"
40,00:02:42.96,00:02:42.96,"going to happen next. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
41,00:02:48.08,00:02:48.08,>> My mind is blown.  Captioning sponsored by

43,00:02:56.79,00:02:56.79,"(theme song playing) >> Yeah, man."
44,00:03:54.58,00:03:54.58,>> Yeah. >> I've got a question before
45,00:03:59.29,00:03:59.29,I go off and cut down two... >> Yeah.
46,00:04:05.25,00:04:05.25,>> I just want to be in agreement with you guys on what
47,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,"you want to do. >> I know. Man, my lungs feel"
48,00:04:13.46,00:04:13.46,like-- >> Are you all right?
49,00:04:16.50,00:04:16.50,You looked ruined yesterday. >> I feel like I scarred my
50,00:04:18.75,00:04:18.75,lungs yesterday. And my lungs feel like I smoked
51,00:04:26.25,00:04:26.25,20 cigars in a row yesterday and inhaled all of them.
52,00:04:29.83,00:04:29.83,"But, I mean, like, for me, it's whatever you guys want."
53,00:04:32.21,00:04:32.21,I was talking to the guys about Exile.
54,00:04:34.62,00:04:34.62,And I don't want to go to Exile. Nobody wants to go to Exile at
55,00:04:37.04,00:04:37.04,this point. I just hope my asthma doesn't
56,00:04:40.96,00:04:40.96,play up. That's a horrible excuse.
57,00:04:43.62,00:04:43.62,"You know, that's my only fear. I'm just making it out here."
58,00:04:47.17,00:04:47.17,This asthma is kicking my ass. My back is killing me every day.
59,00:04:50.42,00:04:50.42,So how do I handle that adversity?
60,00:04:53.12,00:04:53.12,">> So what do you think, Coach? >> You know what I think is"
61,00:04:56.75,00:04:56.75,the-the noble thing is that we send J.T. or myself.
62,00:05:00.88,00:05:00.88,"But the cold, calculating competitor in me wants to send"
63,00:05:08.50,00:05:08.50,Taj or Erinn. It's really up to you guys what
64,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,you think. I just want to all be on the
65,00:05:13.25,00:05:13.25,"same page. >> Oh, God! I mean, J.T. and I"
66,00:05:16.46,00:05:16.46,are eager to send Coach to Exile.
67,00:05:18.58,00:05:18.58,He has been so skittish about it.
68,00:05:21.79,00:05:21.79,He has been selling out everyone trying to get them to
69,00:05:24.04,00:05:24.04,"go to Exile before him. I mean, you know, Coach has"
70,00:05:26.58,00:05:26.58,"mentioned ailments, you know, a back problem, asthma, but it"
71,00:05:30.08,00:05:30.08,never seemed to really affect his performance.
72,00:05:33.12,00:05:33.12,So I'm not entirely sure Coach can build a fire and cook this
73,00:05:36.08,00:05:36.08,food by himself. I don't know.
74,00:05:39.12,00:05:39.12,I think he's scared. Do you want to just tell him?
75,00:05:41.50,00:05:41.50,>> Huh? >> You want to just tell him
76,00:05:43.46,00:05:43.46,we're sending him to Exile? >> Doesn't matter.
77,00:05:52.04,00:05:52.04,"Coach, he's just really scared to go to Exile."
78,00:05:55.12,00:05:55.12,Such an adventurous soul as Coach shouldn't really be scared
79,00:05:57.88,00:05:57.88,"to go to Exile. So I'm ready to test him, and"
80,00:06:01.25,00:06:01.25,also we plan on sending Coach home at the next Tribal
81,00:06:04.21,00:06:04.21,"Council, so it would be nice for him to come very weak to"
82,00:06:06.58,00:06:06.58,"the next immunity challenge. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
83,00:06:24.58,00:06:24.58,"What's up, final five? >> Hi."
84,00:06:27.12,00:06:27.12,">> How you doing, Jeff? >> PROBST: You guys ready to get"
85,00:06:31.04,00:06:31.04,to today's challenge? >> Yes.
86,00:06:32.67,00:06:32.67,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: For today's challenge
87,00:06:34.21,00:06:34.21,you will race through a maze. You must then build a pole long
88,00:06:38.96,00:06:38.96,enough to retrieve a sandbag. You'll swing the sandbag in an
89,00:06:43.12,00:06:43.12,"attempt to knock over three targets, raising a flag."
90,00:06:48.04,00:06:48.04,First person to raise their flag wins.
91,00:06:51.54,00:06:51.54,One more element to this challenge-- you will run the
92,00:06:54.08,00:06:54.08,entire challenge with your feet shackled together.
93,00:06:57.04,00:06:57.04,Want to know what you're playing for?
94,00:06:59.25,00:06:59.25,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: The winner of this
95,00:07:01.12,00:07:01.12,challenge will be taken on an overnight reward.
96,00:07:05.04,00:07:05.04,You will leave camp. You will be taken to the
97,00:07:07.29,00:07:07.29,"governor's retreat, where you will enjoy a bed, a shower, a"
98,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,"feast. In addition, the winner will"
99,00:07:16.46,00:07:16.46,send one person to Exile Island. Worth playing for?
100,00:07:18.96,00:07:18.96,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: I know it is.
101,00:07:20.71,00:07:20.71,"We'll draw for spots, we'll get started."
102,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,"Here we go, for reward. Survivors ready?"
103,00:07:32.46,00:07:32.46,Go! J.T. in the lead.
104,00:07:41.67,00:07:41.67,"Is he right? Everybody following J.T.,"
105,00:07:45.25,00:07:45.25,except Taj. She's going her own way.
106,00:07:47.29,00:07:47.29,"Somebody's going to be right, somebody's going to be wrong."
107,00:07:49.33,00:07:49.33,Stephen hits a dead end. >> This is dumb!
108,00:07:52.33,00:07:52.33,>> PROBST: Taj hits a dead end. J.T.'s on the right course.
109,00:07:56.75,00:07:56.75,Coach right behind. Coach taking the smart strategy.
110,00:08:03.42,00:08:03.42,"He's just going to follow J.T., let him lead."
111,00:08:07.17,00:08:07.17,Erinn going to follow Coach and J.T.
112,00:08:09.38,00:08:09.38,It's follow the leader. J.T. and Coach through the
113,00:08:17.67,00:08:17.67,second section of the maze. Erinn right in it.
114,00:08:23.00,00:08:23.00,Taj and Stephen falling out of it.
115,00:08:27.21,00:08:27.21,J.T. having no trouble at all with this maze.
116,00:08:31.17,00:08:31.17,Coach having no trouble following him.
117,00:08:34.08,00:08:34.08,J.T. and Coach entering the final section of the maze.
118,00:08:40.08,00:08:40.08,J.T. is through the maze. Coach right behind.
119,00:08:45.38,00:08:45.38,Now you've got to start working on that pole.
120,00:08:52.04,00:08:52.04,">> You guys, help me out here. >> PROBST: Erinn, Stephen, Taj,"
121,00:08:55.21,00:08:55.21,now very far behind. Right now this challenge is
122,00:08:58.79,00:08:58.79,"between J.T. and Coach. >> Come on, J.T."
123,00:09:02.21,00:09:02.21,>> PROBST: Coach would love to win a reward.
124,00:09:04.17,00:09:04.17,">> Damn right about that. >> Back, back, back, back, back."
125,00:09:09.25,00:09:09.25,>> PROBST: J.T. already working on his pole.
126,00:09:12.12,00:09:12.12,Coach still untying his pieces. Taj through the maze.
127,00:09:16.79,00:09:16.79,Erinn through the maze. Stephen through the maze.
128,00:09:20.42,00:09:20.42,Everybody's now working on their pole.
129,00:09:31.08,00:09:31.08,J.T. has a nice pole coming along.
130,00:09:34.00,00:09:34.00,Coach picking up the pace. J.T. with a bit of a lead.
131,00:09:39.88,00:09:39.88,J.T. now has four pieces of pole together.
132,00:09:44.08,00:09:44.08,"Once you think your pole is long enough, reach for that"
133,00:09:47.08,00:09:47.08,"sandbag. J.T. has his pole together, and"
134,00:09:50.96,00:09:50.96,has reached for his bag. Coach needs to pick it up.
135,00:09:56.29,00:09:56.29,J.T. knocks over his first target.
136,00:09:58.46,00:09:58.46,>> Nice job. >> PROBST: There are a total of
137,00:10:00.12,00:10:00.12,three targets you have to hit. J.T.'s knocked over his second
138,00:10:04.12,00:10:04.12,target. One target left for a big
139,00:10:06.38,00:10:06.38,reward. Coach now in on it.
140,00:10:09.58,00:10:09.58,Will his pole reach? J.T. wins reward!
141,00:10:17.25,00:10:17.25,>> Whoo! >> That was awesome.
142,00:10:19.25,00:10:19.25,>> All right! (applause)
143,00:10:25.88,00:10:25.88,">> PROBST: J.T., come on over. First order of business, sending"
144,00:10:31.83,00:10:31.83,one person to Exile island. They will not go on the reward.
145,00:10:36.21,00:10:36.21,"They will not go back to camp. They will have another hot,"
146,00:10:39.17,00:10:39.17,probably wet stay away from all of the politics of what is
147,00:10:42.96,00:10:42.96,going on these last few days. Exile is the one place you do
148,00:10:48.12,00:10:48.12,not want to be on Day 34. >> Any volunteers?
149,00:10:57.58,00:10:57.58,"Let's be noble, Coach. >> Okay."
150,00:10:59.58,00:10:59.58,>> Let's do this. >> Yep.
151,00:11:00.96,00:11:00.96,">> Me and you's the only two that hasn't been, man."
152,00:11:02.96,00:11:02.96,">> You bet. >> Thank you, J.T."
153,00:11:04.33,00:11:04.33,">> PROBST: Coach, how do you feel about going to Exile?"
154,00:11:06.17,00:11:06.17,>> I'm good. I'm going to take the monastic approach.
155,00:11:08.21,00:11:08.21,"I'm not gonna build a fire, not gonna eat."
156,00:11:10.17,00:11:10.17,I'm just gonna meditate. >> He's going to take the martyr
157,00:11:12.54,00:11:12.54,"approach, so when he comes back he can not have eaten, not have"
158,00:11:16.50,00:11:16.50,"slept, not have had any water, to-- minimizing the experiences"
159,00:11:20.67,00:11:20.67,"of some, I feel like-- and have an excuse when he doesn't win"
160,00:11:24.08,00:11:24.08,immunity when he gets back. >> That's pretty harsh.
161,00:11:26.54,00:11:26.54,>> Kind of how I feel. Sorry. >> PROBST: Is there something
162,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,to what Erinn said about maybe trying to put yourself in the
163,00:11:31.21,00:11:31.21,position so that you've had the worst experience at Exile?
164,00:11:34.79,00:11:34.79,">> I want it to be tough on me, that's for sure."
165,00:11:37.54,00:11:37.54,I'm not going to minimize everybody's experience.
166,00:11:39.38,00:11:39.38,"In fact, I'm disappointed that Erinn would say that."
167,00:11:41.38,00:11:41.38,"You know, since the beginning of the game she wanted to"
168,00:11:43.25,00:11:43.25,"try to, uh, cut me down a little bit and a lot of"
169,00:11:45.54,00:11:45.54,times when people do that it's to vault themselves over.
170,00:11:47.92,00:11:47.92,I think maybe she wants to leave here with the toughest Exile
171,00:11:50.12,00:11:50.12,experience. And I don't want to take that
172,00:11:52.04,00:11:52.04,away from her. As far as coming back and
173,00:11:54.00,00:11:54.00,"winning immunity, my body is about this close right now"
174,00:11:57.25,00:11:57.25,"from, uh, total disaster. I've got, uh, disks on the right"
175,00:12:02.25,00:12:02.25,side that have ruptured. I feel my left one is about
176,00:12:04.58,00:12:04.58,ready to slip. My asthma is choking me up so
177,00:12:06.96,00:12:06.96,bad I can't breathe.  There's no excuse about if I win
178,00:12:10.04,00:12:10.04,immunity or if I don't win immunity.
179,00:12:12.21,00:12:12.21,"I make no excuses. So, you know, you can throw"
180,00:12:15.21,00:12:15.21,"stones at me, you can, everybody else can and I go like this."
181,00:12:17.75,00:12:17.75,"Give me your best shot. Hit me with your best shot, Pat"
182,00:12:20.54,00:12:20.54,"Benatar, doesn't matter to me. >> PROBST: All right, Coach,"
183,00:12:23.21,00:12:23.21,grab your personal items. Head out.
184,00:12:27.46,00:12:27.46,Coach will return in time for the next immunity challenge.
185,00:12:30.25,00:12:30.25,">> I bit you guys adieu. >> Thank you, Coach."
186,00:12:33.46,00:12:33.46,">> PROBST: All right, J.T., let's get to the reward."
187,00:12:36.46,00:12:36.46,"You're going to take one person with you, meaning you're going"
188,00:12:40.25,00:12:40.25,to leave two people behind. Maybe the best reward so far.
189,00:12:44.42,00:12:44.42,"Who you taking with? >> I gotta, I gotta take the"
190,00:12:48.42,00:12:48.42,only person that took me-- I guess Stephen.
191,00:12:50.79,00:12:50.79,">> Thank you, J.T. >> We'll be fine."
192,00:12:52.71,00:12:52.71,>> Ya'll don't hate me. >> We'll be fine.
193,00:12:54.21,00:12:54.21,">> We'll be great. >> PROBST: Erinn, Taj, I got"
194,00:12:56.50,00:12:56.50,"nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to"
195,00:12:58.50,00:12:58.50,camp. >> Have fun!
196,00:13:01.46,00:13:01.46,">> PROBST: Head out, guys. Enjoy."
197,00:13:03.46,00:13:03.46,">> Coach looked like he was going to go without a fight, but"
198,00:13:07.04,00:13:07.04,Erinn had to try to rub it in his face.
199,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,"I mean, she's just shooting herself in the foot."
200,00:13:12.79,00:13:12.79,"People are so dumb in this game. I mean, they talk way too much."
201,00:13:15.75,00:13:15.75,"So, it's going to hurt her and not me."
202,00:13:33.21,00:13:33.21,>> It is quiet! Love it.
203,00:13:36.79,00:13:36.79,">> And it's a nice, sunny day. >> Good, there will be no shade"
204,00:13:39.04,00:13:39.04,for Coach. J.T. won and took Stephen on
205,00:13:46.00,00:13:46.00,"reward, which is fine. The guys can go out and have a"
206,00:13:48.00,00:13:48.00,good time. I'm not worried about it at all.
207,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,I feel very confident in my alliance with Stephen and J.T.
208,00:13:52.46,00:13:52.46,"We vowed that we'd go to the final three together, and we"
209,00:13:55.25,00:13:55.25,"will. >> Well, interesting day, if"
210,00:13:59.83,00:13:59.83,nothing else. I'm feeling a little guilty.
211,00:14:04.17,00:14:04.17,>> Why? >> About what I said.
212,00:14:06.75,00:14:06.75,It was not an appropriate venue to say that.
213,00:14:09.21,00:14:09.21,"Like, it's a conversation I probably should have had with"
214,00:14:11.12,00:14:11.12,"him. >> No, no. He's a jerk."
215,00:14:14.25,00:14:14.25,"He's a jerk. To say, ""I'm not going to eat."""
216,00:14:16.58,00:14:16.58,Give me a break. You're sitting here suffering
217,00:14:19.21,00:14:19.21,"from asthma, a broken disk, this and that, and you're not going"
218,00:14:21.62,00:14:21.62,"to eat? >> Why wouldn't you, like, try"
219,00:14:23.58,00:14:23.58,"and make yourself feel better? >> Oh, he's making me sick."
220,00:14:26.17,00:14:26.17,I'm so ready to send his ass home.
221,00:14:28.04,00:14:28.04,">> I know, me, too, but... >> And you know what kills me?"
222,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,"He's talking all this smack about how he's so broken down,"
223,00:14:32.96,00:14:32.96,but he was perfectly fine when he was on J.T.'s heels.
224,00:14:35.46,00:14:35.46,"Had he won, the ""warrior"" would have been back."
225,00:14:37.17,00:14:37.17,">> Oh, I know, I know. Yeah, I just, I don't"
226,00:14:39.33,00:14:39.33,understand the man. I don't understand his motives.
227,00:14:42.17,00:14:42.17,"I would hate, hate, hate for anything that I said today to"
228,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,send me home before him. >> Don't worry yourself.
229,00:14:48.75,00:14:48.75,Please don't worry. >> Okay.
230,00:14:50.12,00:14:50.12,>> Do not worry. >> My strategy definitely is to
231,00:14:53.04,00:14:53.04,go as far as I can with J.T. and Stephen.
232,00:14:56.62,00:14:56.62,I would hate for anything I said to have changed the way that
233,00:15:00.25,00:15:00.25,"Stephen and J.T. view me, but this is really the time where"
234,00:15:03.46,00:15:03.46,you do start to get really paranoid about this stuff.
235,00:15:40.71,00:15:40.71,(bird screeches) >> This is going to be like a
236,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,vacation for me. A little sun tan out here...
237,00:15:54.42,00:15:54.42,All those wishy-washy people at camp with no character. Phew!
238,00:16:01.96,00:16:01.96,Coach Wade's foundation is built on a rock.
239,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,"Inside here... Unbreakable, unbending,"
240,00:16:12.25,00:16:12.25,"unyielding, immeasurable, immovable, invincible."
241,00:16:18.58,00:16:18.58,Staying out here for a week without any food will only
242,00:16:23.25,00:16:23.25,"make me a better, stronger person."
243,00:16:25.21,00:16:25.21,"Those guys won't be able to get old Coach Wade down, I'll tell"
244,00:16:27.71,00:16:27.71,you that. I will not have anything to eat.
245,00:16:31.67,00:16:31.67,It's going to be like the ancient American Indians that
246,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,are my ancestors. They used to go out into the
247,00:16:36.46,00:16:36.46,wilderness for 48 hours and they would commune with the
248,00:16:39.46,00:16:39.46,creator of the universe and they would become men.
249,00:16:43.83,00:16:43.83,"Well, I'm already a man. So, this will just make me more"
250,00:16:46.12,00:16:46.12,"of a man, but this is going to be an adventure."
251,00:16:48.88,00:16:48.88,Thank you for creating me as an individual.
252,00:16:52.38,00:16:52.38,I ask that you would help me to forgive Erinn as she's back at
253,00:16:55.00,00:16:55.00,camp thinking negative thoughts about me.
254,00:17:00.21,00:17:00.21,"At the challenge, Erinn said, ""Well, I think Coach is just"
255,00:17:02.71,00:17:02.71,"being a martyr."" But I just let her have it."
256,00:17:06.62,00:17:06.62,Dragon slayer makes his dragon cane.
257,00:17:09.25,00:17:09.25,Whether it's because I'm speaking such truth that nobody
258,00:17:12.71,00:17:12.71,"can deny it or because I'm so eloquent, whatever the case, I"
259,00:17:15.83,00:17:15.83,got the last word. And I hope she goes home next.
260,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,She's certainly going to get my vote.
261,00:17:22.50,00:17:22.50,"Coach Wade's body might be failing him in many ways, but"
262,00:17:26.08,00:17:26.08,Coach Wade still has what it takes to outlast anybody out
263,00:17:29.67,00:17:29.67,"here in this environment. Period, paragraph."
264,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,">> Oh, man! >> Oh, wow."
265,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,"This is how I like to travel. >> When I woke up this morning,"
266,00:18:04.33,00:18:04.33,I never would have imagined I'd be in a private plane.
267,00:18:07.17,00:18:07.17,>> Look at this. This is the freaking life.
268,00:18:09.12,00:18:09.12,>> This was the best reward I could have possibly asked for.
269,00:18:12.12,00:18:12.12,"A private plane to, uh, the governor's retreat."
270,00:18:15.25,00:18:15.25,I just really soaked it up. That's always been a dream of
271,00:18:17.67,00:18:17.67,"mine, have a private plane and to be able to fly on one like"
272,00:18:21.12,00:18:21.12,"that, and it was really awesome. >> Ha-ha! Whoo!"
273,00:18:28.58,00:18:28.58,">> Hey, we're getting low. Good job, guys."
274,00:18:35.58,00:18:35.58,">> Thank you. >> Oh, man!"
275,00:18:43.88,00:18:43.88,>> Hello. >> Hello.
276,00:18:45.25,00:18:45.25,">> Hey. >> Welcome to Pousada Cantao,"
277,00:18:47.79,00:18:47.79,"the governor's retreat. >> Oh, my gosh!"
278,00:18:50.75,00:18:50.75,">> Oh, man, this is nice. >> This is ridiculous."
279,00:18:53.21,00:18:53.21,">> I mean, this place is just beautiful."
280,00:18:55.25,00:18:55.25,You can tell there were some big parties thrown at this
281,00:18:57.12,00:18:57.12,place. >> Here it is.
282,00:19:01.12,00:19:01.12,">> All right, thank you. Whoo!"
283,00:19:04.08,00:19:04.08,>> You're welcome. >> We were taken to our room.
284,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,"Oh, my God, a bed, a shower. >> Oh, wow!"
285,00:19:11.38,00:19:11.38,"Oh, my gosh! This is what I look like! Wow!"
286,00:19:16.12,00:19:16.12,"That is a beard, all right. I think it'd look good with a"
287,00:19:19.00,00:19:19.00,"little trim. >> Look at my hair, man."
288,00:19:21.38,00:19:21.38,">> When we stepped into the bathroom, we looked at"
289,00:19:23.79,00:19:23.79,ourselves in the mirror and that was a shock.
290,00:19:26.29,00:19:26.29,"I mean, I haven't seen myself in over a month."
291,00:19:29.38,00:19:29.38,"Oh, my God. My teeth are gross now."
292,00:19:32.88,00:19:32.88,">> I need to take a shower. >> Shower, I know."
293,00:19:35.92,00:19:35.92,">> Yeah. I was like, man, I've got to"
294,00:19:38.62,00:19:38.62,"get a shower, get out of here. So, oh, man, it was like"
295,00:19:41.46,00:19:41.46,heaven. Oh!
296,00:19:45.92,00:19:45.92,"Oh, man! I can't get enough of this soap."
297,00:19:50.92,00:19:50.92,34 days. I have not washed my nasty self.
298,00:19:56.17,00:19:56.17,"Oh! >> As soon as we were clean, we"
299,00:20:05.75,00:20:05.75,left our room and went for our feast.
300,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,>> What you're gonna have tonight is authentic Brazilian
301,00:20:11.92,00:20:11.92,"churrasco. >> Oh, yes!"
302,00:20:14.33,00:20:14.33,>> It's a Brazilian barbecue with many kinds of meat.
303,00:20:18.00,00:20:18.00,Eat as much as you want. >> Thank you so much.
304,00:20:21.12,00:20:21.12,">> See you later. >> Oh, wow! Oh, wow!"
305,00:20:24.42,00:20:24.42,>> Yes! Feliz navidad.
306,00:20:27.21,00:20:27.21,">> Oh, wow! Oh, my God!"
307,00:20:30.25,00:20:30.25,This meat is incredible. >> Yeah.
308,00:20:35.12,00:20:35.12,">> Oh, my! >> Is there more?"
309,00:20:39.00,00:20:39.00,>> Por favor. >> Mm-hmm.
310,00:20:44.92,00:20:44.92,>> Yeah. We were having a meat festival.
311,00:20:47.62,00:20:47.62,"We had steaks, we had pork, we had a grilled pineapple."
312,00:20:52.83,00:20:52.83,"We were filling up and, basically, by the time we were"
313,00:20:57.04,00:20:57.04,"done with the meats, we were stuffed."
314,00:20:59.42,00:20:59.42,"(sighs) >> Well, buddy..."
315,00:21:02.00,00:21:02.00,>> Cheers. >> To the final two in this
316,00:21:04.00,00:21:04.00,game. >> Final two.
317,00:21:08.21,00:21:08.21,"Ah. >> I mean, we got this thing,"
318,00:21:12.62,00:21:12.62,man. There's no reason why you and I
319,00:21:14.33,00:21:14.33,aren't sitting in the final two. >> Coach totally depends on us.
320,00:21:17.08,00:21:17.08,">> Coach is totally with us, and I will take Coach to the final"
321,00:21:21.25,00:21:21.25,three. >> Today at the reward

328,00:21:46.33,00:21:46.33,makes me want to keep her less. What is that going to do for
329,00:21:49.04,00:21:49.04,"her? I mean, it's just not"
330,00:21:50.04,00:21:50.04,"strategic. >> You can never tell, man."

334,00:22:38.58,00:22:38.58,No food. Very little water.
335,00:22:41.67,00:22:41.67,And it was friggin' awesome. It was a great experience to be
336,00:22:46.42,00:22:46.42,out here and once again test myself and have nothing.

375,00:25:41.17,00:25:41.17,one-in-four shot of winning this game.
376,00:25:44.75,00:25:44.75,"Losers, Tribal Council, somebody going home."
377,00:25:47.88,00:25:47.88,We'll take our spots. We'll get started.
378,00:25:52.88,00:25:52.88,"Here we go. All right, everybody's got"
379,00:25:55.33,00:25:55.33,their arms inside the frame. Their feet on the first peg.
380,00:26:00.04,00:26:00.04,"This challenge is underway. You cannot use your butt, your"
381,00:26:11.92,00:26:11.92,"back, or your hips to lean against the wall to give you"
382,00:26:15.21,00:26:15.21,support. This is where mental toughness
383,00:26:18.21,00:26:18.21,"is going to win out. All right, we're going to get"
384,00:26:31.71,00:26:31.71,ready to move to the next smaller foothold.
385,00:26:34.12,00:26:34.12,I'm going to count you into this.
386,00:26:36.21,00:26:36.21,"Five, four, three, two, one. Take your time."
387,00:26:42.21,00:26:42.21,Get yourself settled. Everybody's looking good.
388,00:26:52.33,00:26:52.33,"Coach, you think the time you spent on Exile meditating may"
389,00:26:55.21,00:26:55.21,have conveniently prepared you for a challenge like this?
390,00:26:59.00,00:26:59.00,>> Deep down inside the pit of every man's stomach is a
391,00:27:02.17,00:27:02.17,feeling that he's no longer going to be invincible.
392,00:27:05.54,00:27:05.54,"So, for me to go out there and to put myself in the most"
393,00:27:07.79,00:27:07.79,"extreme situation that I could, I did it because I wanted for"
394,00:27:12.79,00:27:12.79,my mind to once and for all tell my body that you still
395,00:27:17.54,00:27:17.54,have it. >> PROBST: Perfect opportunity
396,00:27:19.83,00:27:19.83,to put that philosophy to the test in this challenge.
397,00:27:23.29,00:27:23.29,Because this is about mind over matter.
398,00:27:27.25,00:27:27.25,"And it will get difficult. All right, we're going to now"
399,00:27:39.25,00:27:39.25,"move to the final foothold. Five, four, three, two, one."
400,00:27:48.12,00:27:48.12,Erinn drops out before getting on the final foothold.
401,00:27:51.08,00:27:51.08,Erinn will take a spot on the bench.
402,00:27:53.33,00:27:53.33,"No shot at immunity, vulnerable at Tribal Council tonight."
403,00:27:57.08,00:27:57.08,There's no time limit now. This goes until only one
404,00:28:00.83,00:28:00.83,person's left standing. There's no way to prepare for a
405,00:28:06.25,00:28:06.25,challenge like this physically. This is all in your head.
406,00:28:12.46,00:28:12.46,Stephen drops out. Take a spot on the bench.
407,00:28:19.08,00:28:19.08,Taj digging in. Taj cannot hang on any longer.
408,00:28:23.92,00:28:23.92,Taj is out of the challenge. We are down to two.
409,00:28:29.17,00:28:29.17,J.T. and Coach. The listener and the talker.
410,00:28:34.62,00:28:34.62,"The young buck, the older warrior, battling it out for a"
411,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,guaranteed spot in the final four.
412,00:28:54.21,00:28:54.21,">> Got any food, Jeff? >> PROBST: If I wheeled out a"
413,00:28:57.33,00:28:57.33,"big old steak and a six-pack, you'd step down?"
414,00:29:00.54,00:29:00.54,">> Probably so, Jeff. >> Well, then you might as well"
415,00:29:02.79,00:29:02.79,"step down, unless you're trying to vote me off tonight."
416,00:29:05.08,00:29:05.08,">> I can't believe you don't trust me, Coach."
417,00:29:07.12,00:29:07.12,">> I do trust you. I trust you implicitly, J.T."
418,00:29:09.92,00:29:09.92,You know that. >> Good.
419,00:29:11.67,00:29:11.67,>> You are a man of your word. Few and far are those left in
420,00:29:14.38,00:29:14.38,this world. >> PROBST: This is just how you
421,00:29:16.62,00:29:16.62,"want it, isn't it, Coach? Battle against the best."
422,00:29:21.04,00:29:21.04,You've been talking about it for 36 days.
423,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,You're getting it today. Been up there 50 minutes now.
424,00:29:44.21,00:29:44.21,You're going to have to fight the pain.
425,00:29:47.17,00:29:47.17,Your feet will recover. No way to recover if you're
426,00:29:50.25,00:29:50.25,voted out. >> You ain't going to let me
427,00:29:55.04,00:29:55.04,"try the necklace on, are you, Coach?"
428,00:29:56.75,00:29:56.75,>> Nope. >> I don't blame you.
429,00:29:58.17,00:29:58.17,>> I got something to prove coming back from Exile.
430,00:30:23.17,00:30:23.17,(screams) >> PROBST: Coach steps down.
431,00:30:40.04,00:30:40.04,>> That's all right. >> PROBST: J.T. has won
432,00:30:42.17,00:30:42.17,"individual immunity. >> Oh, my God, man."
433,00:30:47.42,00:30:47.42,"Geez, are you okay, man? You did awesome."
434,00:30:51.42,00:30:51.42,>> Be hard-headed. Get up. Come on.
435,00:30:53.42,00:30:53.42,>> Are you okay? >> My back was... my back was
436,00:30:57.25,00:30:57.25,"spasming up there. >> Can you stand up now, though?"
437,00:31:00.71,00:31:00.71,">> Oh, man. You did an incredible..."
438,00:31:03.75,00:31:03.75,">> Come on, stand up. >> You don't have to stand up"
439,00:31:11.67,00:31:11.67,if you can't yet. >> PROBST: Where are you feeling
440,00:31:16.38,00:31:16.38,it? >> My back spasmed while I was
441,00:31:19.38,00:31:19.38,"up there the last ten minutes. >> Oh, my God, man."
442,00:31:22.21,00:31:22.21,>> I felt something go. I tried. I couldn't do it.
443,00:31:26.88,00:31:26.88,>> PROBST: You going to want medical to look at that?
444,00:31:28.42,00:31:28.42,">> Nope, nobody is taking me out of the game right now."
445,00:31:30.62,00:31:30.62,"If medical would really look at my back, I wouldn't be here, so,"
446,00:31:33.00,00:31:33.00,"no, please don't have them look at my back."
447,00:31:40.50,00:31:40.50,">> PROBST: J.T., congratulations. "
448,00:31:42.42,00:31:42.42,(applause) J.T. is safe at tonight's Tribal
449,00:31:45.21,00:31:45.21,"Council. Coach, Stephen, Taj, Erinn, one"
450,00:31:49.83,00:31:49.83,of the four of you going home after 36 long days out here.
451,00:31:53.67,00:31:53.67,Grab your stuff and head back to camp.
452,00:31:55.58,00:31:55.58,"I will see you at Tribal. >> Could have gone a lot longer,"
453,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,huh? >> Yeah.
454,00:31:59.58,00:31:59.58,>> I figured that. >> It looked like Coach had
455,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"really been suffering. You know, he looked like Exile"
456,00:32:05.58,00:32:05.58,"had really been tough. You know, I definitely felt bad"
457,00:32:07.58,00:32:07.58,"for the guy. But, you know, Coach is still"
458,00:32:09.88,00:32:09.88,the dragon slayer and a really strong competitor.
459,00:32:12.04,00:32:12.04,"If I want to win this game, I want people I can beat in the"
460,00:32:15.12,00:32:15.12,finals. (thunder rumbles)
461,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,">> Well, congratulations. >> Nice job."
462,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,">> You all right, Coach? Huh? >> Coach was really ridiculous"
463,00:33:01.00,00:33:01.00,"today. I mean, he walks in like he can"
464,00:33:04.08,00:33:04.08,"barely move, and then he's standing up on these things"
465,00:33:07.62,00:33:07.62,"for, like, near an hour. >> He's an interesting man,"
466,00:33:14.25,00:33:14.25,right there. >> Yeah.
467,00:33:21.12,00:33:21.12,>> He's so full of it. >> I know.
468,00:33:24.00,00:33:24.00,"He's been walking around since we've been back, like, you're"
469,00:33:27.46,00:33:27.46,not as broken down as you're trying to make yourself look.
470,00:33:31.08,00:33:31.08,"And, really, like, I'm ready for him to go home."
471,00:33:33.67,00:33:33.67,"And the other thing, too, when Jeff asked him if he wanted"
472,00:33:35.79,00:33:35.79,medical to look at him. >> Yeah.
473,00:33:37.58,00:33:37.58,">> No, you don't want them to look at it because they're going"
474,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,to tell you there's nothing wrong with you.
475,00:33:40.75,00:33:40.75,>> There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
476,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,>> He needed an excuse for not winning.
477,00:33:49.21,00:33:49.21,">> That was a classic struggle today, man."
478,00:33:52.04,00:33:52.04,How much longer could you have gone?
479,00:33:54.17,00:33:54.17,">> Probably 30 minutes. >> As iron sharpens iron, so one"
480,00:33:57.08,00:33:57.08,man sharpens another. Our ancestors would hope and
481,00:34:00.46,00:34:00.46,"pray for somebody worthy in battle to defeat them, and I"
482,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,think that that definitely played out today with J.T. and
483,00:34:05.21,00:34:05.21,myself. I was honored by the defeat and
484,00:34:07.67,00:34:07.67,the way that I went down. >> Stephen and I are leaning
485,00:34:10.96,00:34:10.96,towards Erinn. I know Erinn is going to vote
486,00:34:16.54,00:34:16.54,for you. Taj may-- you may get two votes.
487,00:34:19.58,00:34:19.58,"But Stephen and I and you vote Erinn, she's gone."
488,00:34:22.54,00:34:22.54,">> J.T. reassures me, tells me, hey, everything's cool, man."
489,00:34:26.29,00:34:26.29,Don't worry-- Erinn needs to go tonight because of the comment
490,00:34:29.04,00:34:29.04,that she made the other day. It was unforgivable.
491,00:34:31.58,00:34:31.58,It's just her time to go. It's been her time to go for
492,00:34:33.71,00:34:33.71,"a while. I mean, sending me to Exile,"
493,00:34:35.83,00:34:35.83,"supposedly, mentally, I'm supposed to be down, so she's"
494,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,trying to kick me while I'm on the ground.
495,00:34:39.71,00:34:39.71,">> Oh, yeah, that's it. That's all she's doing."
496,00:34:41.17,00:34:41.17,">> And you know, a lot of my bravado is just 'cause I'm"
497,00:34:43.21,00:34:43.21,"trying to tell myself, hey, you're still kind of the man."
498,00:34:45.12,00:34:45.12,">> Guys. >> Hey, come on down."
499,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,>> So you really want to send Erinn home tonight?
500,00:34:54.08,00:34:54.08,>> I was really pissed off. When she went to Exile we were
501,00:34:56.25,00:34:56.25,"all, like, patting her on the back."
502,00:34:57.92,00:34:57.92,"We weren't trying to kick her, because, you know, I mean--"
503,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,"I just thought it was, like, so tasteless and classless."
504,00:35:03.96,00:35:03.96,J.T. and I sat down with Coach and we reassured him that
505,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,the warrior alliance was good. Erinn was going home tonight.
506,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,And J.T. is going to vote for Erinn because he feels like he
507,00:35:13.08,00:35:13.08,promised Coach that he would. But I don't know what I'm going
508,00:35:16.79,00:35:16.79,"to do. I don't... I mean, it's really"
509,00:35:19.08,00:35:19.08,tricky right now. >> She tried to call me out in
510,00:35:21.88,00:35:21.88,"the very beginning, and I was like, those are the kind of"
511,00:35:24.08,00:35:24.08,people that get their ass voted out.
512,00:35:27.04,00:35:27.04,">> Right, because no one trusts them."
513,00:35:28.42,00:35:28.42,>> Brendan did it. Tyson started getting sketchy.
514,00:35:31.29,00:35:31.29,">> Well, Erinn belongs right beside them."
515,00:35:33.62,00:35:33.62,>> And you're totally cool with that?
516,00:35:35.08,00:35:35.08,"I mean, I'm just asking, right? I mean, there's not going to be"
517,00:35:37.33,00:35:37.33,"any surprises tonight, right? >> No."
518,00:35:39.21,00:35:39.21,">> I'm done with the surprises at Tribal, man."
519,00:35:42.75,00:35:42.75,The warrior alliance is still going strong.
520,00:35:45.71,00:35:45.71,"I surrounded myself with strong players, and to this date, it"
521,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,has not backfired on me. It looks like through all the
522,00:35:53.33,00:35:53.33,"blindsides, Coach Wade will be the last tribe member left of"
523,00:35:57.04,00:35:57.04,what used to be Timbira. I am the last of the Mohicans.
524,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
525,00:36:29.33,00:36:29.33,"Brendan, Tyson, Sierra, and Debbie, voted out at the last"
526,00:36:35.12,00:36:35.12,"Tribal Council. So, Coach let's start with your"
527,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,stay on Exile Island. When J.T. picked you to go to
528,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,"Exile, you made your big thing, about, ""I'm going to do this"
529,00:36:48.04,00:36:48.04,"the hard way."" Erinn, you didn't like that."
530,00:36:50.58,00:36:50.58,">> I didn't. Like, he's weak and he's this"
531,00:36:54.21,00:36:54.21,and he's that and then to go off and not eat or drink for three
532,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,"days, that just really rubbed me the wrong way, and it just"
533,00:37:00.96,00:37:00.96,minimized the entire experience that the rest of us were having.
534,00:37:04.88,00:37:04.88,>> PROBST: Was there a part of you that had just come off one
535,00:37:07.33,00:37:07.33,"of the roughest stays on Exile, feeling a little bit like you're"
536,00:37:10.75,00:37:10.75,going to upstage me with your dramatic exile?
537,00:37:13.71,00:37:13.71,">> Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Like, the time that I spent out"
538,00:37:16.62,00:37:16.62,there sucked. It was the worst thing I've
539,00:37:19.33,00:37:19.33,ever done. I never want to do it again.
540,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,"And you're standing there going, ""Oh, I totally want to"
541,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,"do that; that sounds awesome."" Like, that sucks."
542,00:37:27.88,00:37:27.88,">> PROBST: Coach, you respect what Erinn's saying?"
543,00:37:30.83,00:37:30.83,>> I think that everybody here that's been to Exile had a much
544,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,tougher time than me. But I had past experiences with
545,00:37:36.08,00:37:36.08,"which to draw on. Which made it easier for me,"
546,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,"and, you know, a lot of times, men drop what they think is a"
547,00:37:44.29,00:37:44.29,"pebble, but women see a boulder dropping and crashing, an"
548,00:37:47.71,00:37:47.71,overwhelming sense of judgment. I certainly wasn't trying to
549,00:37:50.58,00:37:50.58,minimize her experience or anybody else's for that matter.
550,00:37:53.67,00:37:53.67,"So there's really nothing else to say, you know."
551,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,"Mark Twain-- ""Better for people to think you're a fool than"
552,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,"to open your mouth and remove all doubt."""
553,00:37:59.92,00:37:59.92,I've already done that. I really don't have any place to
554,00:38:01.83,00:38:01.83,"go now. >> PROBST: Erinn, you feel "
555,00:38:04.21,00:38:04.21,pretty secure about your alliance?
