612,00:29:11.77,00:29:11.77,"PLAYED IT THE WHOLE TIME TO GET RID OF THE HUGE THREATS, MAYBE"
613,00:29:14.73,00:29:14.73,WE NEED TO GET RID OF DAN.

621,00:29:43.13,00:29:43.13,>> WHAT?
622,00:29:46.30,00:29:46.30,>> I'M GOOD WITH THAT.
623,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.20,>> HE'S REALLY THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW
624,00:29:52.70,00:29:52.70,BECAUSE HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE.
625,00:29:54.63,00:29:54.63,>> THEIR LITTLE FAMILY IS TURNING ON DAN.

628,00:30:08.53,00:30:08.53,WHAT IF I GET RID OF ONE OF THEM INSTEAD JUST TO COMPLETELY MESS
629,00:30:14.47,00:30:14.47,WITH THEIR PLANS AND NOT GO ALONG WITH WHAT THEY WANT DONE.
630,00:30:17.60,00:30:17.60,>> ALL RIGHT.
631,00:30:23.77,00:30:23.77,">> HERE'S THE DEAL, I CAN GET RID OF YOU TONIGHT EASILY."
632,00:30:27.10,00:30:27.10,EASILY.

656,00:31:16.83,00:31:16.83,>> DAN WAS NOT SHAKEN AT ALL.
657,00:31:19.00,00:31:19.00,HE WAS UPPITY.
658,00:31:19.83,00:31:19.83,HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE HE'S GOING HOME.
659,00:31:21.20,00:31:21.20,THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE OUT IS DAN WANTS TO TAKE WILL AND
660,00:31:26.17,00:31:26.17,RODNEY TO THE END BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE HE CAN
661,00:31:29.60,00:31:29.60,"BEAT, AND IF I'M RIGHT AND HE'S NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT, IT'S ONE"
662,00:31:32.30,00:31:32.30,OF THE GIRLS.

678,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,DAN IS VOTING ONE OF YOU TWO TONIGHT WITH THE BOYS.
679,00:32:14.03,00:32:14.03,ONE MILLION PERCENT.
680,00:32:15.50,00:32:15.50,ONE MILLION PERCENT.
681,00:32:16.93,00:32:16.93,I THINK IT'S YOU TONIGHT.
682,00:32:19.87,00:32:19.87,I'M GOING TO LET YOU GUYS FINISH TALKING.
683,00:32:21.77,00:32:21.77,I'M GOING TO GRAB MY STUFF.
684,00:32:23.80,00:32:23.80,"I -- >> I MEAN, I THINK HE'S PSYCHOO."
685,00:32:29.70,00:32:29.70,HE'S PARANOID.
686,00:32:30.53,00:32:30.53,THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM IN THIS POSITION IN THE FIRST PLACE.
687,00:32:32.57,00:32:32.57,>> I THINK SO.
688,00:32:33.37,00:32:33.37,">> I WANT TO BELIEVE THEY'RE VOTING FOR DAN, BUT WHAT IF THEY"
689,00:32:36.73,00:32:36.73,DON'T VOTE FOR DAN?

691,00:32:39.53,00:32:39.53,"IT COULD BE WILL, RODNEY AND DAN FINAL THREE."
692,00:32:41.87,00:32:41.87,THEY COULD BE SCREWING US OVER AND THIS IS WHERE I AM REALLY
693,00:32:45.60,00:32:45.60,RACKING MY BRAIN IS DO I TRUST THEM?
694,00:32:49.83,00:32:49.83,"I DON'T WANT THE WASTE MY IDOL, AND IF I REALLY BELIEVE THEY'RE"
695,00:32:53.70,00:32:53.70,"GOING TO VOTE FOR DAN, THEN I CAN SAVE IT FOR ONE MORE VOTE."
696,00:33:18.23,00:33:18.23,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

699,00:33:32.50,00:33:32.50,ALL RIGHT.
700,00:33:33.10,00:33:33.10,SO LET'S TALK ABOUT TRUST.
701,00:33:35.50,00:33:35.50,"MIKE, YOU GO BACK TO CAMP AGAIN WITH IMMUNITY, WHICH GIVES YOU A"
702,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,VANTAGE POINT OF NOT HAVING TO WORRY AS MUCH TONIGHT.
703,00:33:43.27,00:33:43.27,"SO BASED ON WHAT YOU SAW THIS AFTERNOON, WOULD YOU SAY THIS IS"
704,00:33:45.43,00:33:45.43,A GROUP OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM THERE IS SOME TRUST?
705,00:33:48.60,00:33:48.60,>> I DEFINITELY THINK THERE'S A COUPLE PEOPLE THAT PROBABLY
706,00:33:51.67,00:33:51.67,"AREN'T FEELING AS TRUSTWORTHY OR AS TRUSTED, BUT THEY STILL HAVE"
707,00:33:55.43,00:33:55.43,"A COMMON ENEMY, THIS GUY RIGHT HERE."

709,00:34:01.83,00:34:01.83,BUT TONIGHT ONE OF FIVE OF THEIR ALLIANCE IS GOING HOME.
710,00:34:05.07,00:34:05.07,"SO, YEAH, THERE WAS SOME SCRAMBLING GOING ON TODAY AT"
711,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,CAMP.

715,00:34:19.93,00:34:19.93,I'M KIND OF LIKE OUT OF MY MIND RIGHT NOW A LITTLE BIT.
716,00:34:23.67,00:34:23.67,>> Jeff: IS THIS A SIGN OF FATIGUE?
717,00:34:26.00,00:34:26.00,>> ABSOLUTELY.
718,00:34:27.30,00:34:27.30,>> Jeff: SO YOUR BRAIN REALLY HAS TO WORK HARD TO TRY TO FORM
719,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,A SENTENCE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DEPLETED.
720,00:34:32.23,00:34:32.23,">> WHEN YOU HAVE VERY LIMITED FOOD, SOMETIMES THAT CAN AFFECT"

723,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,CHALLENGE AND YOU CAN'T REALLY PERFORM BECAUSE YOUR HEAD IS NOT
724,00:34:42.70,00:34:42.70,"THERE, IT CAN GET A LITTLE HARD ON YOU."
725,00:34:45.87,00:34:45.87,SO WHAT WAS THE QUESTION AGAIN?
726,00:34:48.17,00:34:48.17,[LAUGHTER] >> Jeff: ARE YOU AT A POINT IN
727,00:34:52.47,00:34:52.47,THE GAME WHERE YOU TRUST IN THE RELATIONSHIPS YOU'VE MADE?
728,00:34:56.67,00:34:56.67,">> WELL, IT'S DAY 35."
729,00:34:58.77,00:34:58.77,"LET'S BE HONEST, YOU JUST ARE AROUND THE SAME PEOPLE 24/7."
730,00:35:02.63,00:35:02.63,I CAN'T EVEN BE WITH MY MOTHER 24/7 WITHOUT WANTING TO RING HER
731,00:35:06.60,00:35:06.60,NECK AND I LOVE HER TO DEATH.
732,00:35:08.23,00:35:08.23,SO ONE MINUTE YOU THINK YOU CAN TRUST THEM.
733,00:35:10.03,00:35:10.03,ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY COULD BE FORMING ANOTHER ALLIANCE.
734,00:35:12.37,00:35:12.37,"AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE TO GO WITH THE PEOPLE YOU DID"
735,00:35:16.37,00:35:16.37,FORM YOUR ALLIANCES WITH AND HOPEFULLY THOSE ARE THE VOTES ON
736,00:35:18.83,00:35:18.83,YOUR SIDE TONIGHT.
737,00:35:19.40,00:35:19.40,">> CAROLYN, ARE YOU IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU THINK, YEAH,"
738,00:35:22.50,00:35:22.50,I TRUST MY ALLIANCES OR I JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO TRUST ANYBODY?

745,00:35:45.63,00:35:45.63,FROM A THREAT STANDPOINT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TAKE OUT MIKE AND
746,00:35:48.53,00:35:48.53,CAROLYN HAS SHOWN HERSELF TO BE PRETTY DOMINANT IN CHALLENGES.
747,00:35:52.30,00:35:52.30,">> YEAH, CAROLYN HAS DEFINITELY PROVEN HERSELF AGAIN AND AGAIN,"
748,00:35:55.33,00:35:55.33,BUT SHE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH HER HEAD ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
749,00:35:58.47,00:35:58.47,MY NAME HAS COME UP A LOT IN THIS GAME.
750,00:36:01.47,00:36:01.47,>> Jeff: DID YOU HEAR IT THIS AFTERNOON?
751,00:36:03.07,00:36:03.07,>> ABSOLUTELY.
752,00:36:03.73,00:36:03.73,AND THERE'S A TIME TO MAKE A MOVE AND THERE'S A TIME... I
753,00:36:08.77,00:36:08.77,KNOW THIS ANSWER SUCKS BECAUSE IT'S A POLITICAL WAFFLING
754,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,"ANSWER, I CAN MAKE A MOVE OR I CAN STAY WHERE I AM."
755,00:36:14.90,00:36:14.90,"YOU KNOW, FIVE OF US ARE STILL HERE."
756,00:36:17.27,00:36:17.27,BUT NOT AFTER TONIGHT WE WON'T BE.
757,00:36:19.77,00:36:19.77,">> Jeff: WILL, DOES THAT ALARM YOU WHEN YOU HEAR DAN ACTUALLY"
758,00:36:22.37,00:36:22.37,"SAY IT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I'M AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING."
759,00:36:25.67,00:36:25.67,>> ABSOLUTELY.
760,00:36:27.80,00:36:27.80,I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE MIKE CONTINUING TO WIN IMMUNITY IS
761,00:36:31.30,00:36:31.30,DIGGING INTO OUR NUMBERS AND DAN STILL HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN THIS
762,00:36:35.43,00:36:35.43,"GAME, BUT WE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO."
763,00:36:38.90,00:36:38.90,">> Jeff: AND RODNEY, HAVING AN ADVANTAGE GIVES YOU A LOT OF"
764,00:36:41.80,00:36:41.80,"POWER, BUT THE REAL TRICK IS WHEN DO YOU PLAY IT?"
765,00:36:44.03,00:36:44.03,>> THE ADVANTAGE IS LIKE A STRONG-ARM TACTIC.
766,00:36:47.53,00:36:47.53,"YOU CAN SAY I'M GOING TO USE IT TONIGHT AND LET IT BE KNOWN, OR"
767,00:36:50.60,00:36:50.60,YOU CAN KEEP IT IN YOUR BACK POCKET AND NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT
768,00:36:53.07,00:36:53.07,IT.
769,00:36:54.17,00:36:54.17,SO NOW YOU'RE AT FIVE AND YOU USE IT AND IT GETS MORE SCARY
770,00:36:57.73,00:36:57.73,BECAUSE IT COULD BE YOU THAT'S GOING HOME.
771,00:36:59.70,00:36:59.70,">> Jeff: SIERRA, HOW MUCH TALK HAS THERE BEEN ABOUT ADVANTAGES"
772,00:37:02.37,00:37:02.37,AND IDOLS AND WILL THEY BE PLAYED TONIGHT?

774,00:37:06.53,00:37:06.53,YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK OUT THE DOOR WITH SOMETHING IN YOUR BAG
775,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,YOU COULD HAVE PLAYED.
776,00:37:10.90,00:37:10.90,">> Jeff: AND YET, DAN, YOU COULD STRONG ARM, LIKE RODNEY"

778,00:37:15.90,00:37:15.90,>> TONIGHT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT NIGHT TO USE IT.
779,00:37:18.83,00:37:18.83,BUT THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL MIGHT BE EVEN BETTER.
780,00:37:22.17,00:37:22.17,IT MIGHT GET ME TO THAT FINAL FOUR.
781,00:37:24.27,00:37:24.27,"HONEST TO GOD, I'M LIKE A METRONOME GOING BACK AND FORTH"
782,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,"UK BACK AND FORTH, BACK AND FORTH, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE"
783,00:37:29.73,00:37:29.73,RIGHT THING TO DO IS.
