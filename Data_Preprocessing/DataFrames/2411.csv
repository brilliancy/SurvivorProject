945,00:30:02.00,00:30:02.00,"LIKE, WHAT IS THIS?"
946,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME.
947,00:30:04.13,00:30:04.13,AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
948,00:30:09.30,00:30:09.30,SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THE
949,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,VOTES?
950,00:30:12.13,00:30:12.13,AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO CONFIRM

958,00:30:25.47,00:30:25.47,YOU'RE NOT SURE IF HE HAS THE
959,00:30:28.00,00:30:28.00,IDOL.
960,00:30:28.10,00:30:28.10,RIGHT.
961,00:30:29.03,00:30:29.03,AND THEN THE REST OF US WILL

972,00:30:45.17,00:30:45.17,I DON'T WANT HER TO FEEL BAD
973,00:30:46.70,00:30:46.70,BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT FORGET HOW
974,00:30:48.73,00:30:48.73,YOU MAKE THEM FEEL.
975,00:30:51.10,00:30:51.10,"THE REASON WE DID IT, YOU'RE NOT"
976,00:30:53.40,00:30:53.40,"SURPRISED SEEING YOUR NAME ONCE,"
977,00:30:55.17,00:30:55.17,"TWICE, WHATEVER."
978,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT AT
979,00:30:57.60,00:30:57.60,ALL.
980,00:30:58.07,00:30:58.07,I DON'T THINK SHE PROCESSED IT
981,00:31:00.83,00:31:00.83,"ENOUGH, I MAY BE GOING HOME IF"
982,00:31:02.37,00:31:02.37,HE HAS THE IMMUNITY IDOL BUT SHE
983,00:31:05.10,00:31:05.10,WAS FINE WITH IT.
984,00:31:15.07,00:31:15.07,SHE'S GOING TO?
985,00:31:18.73,00:31:18.73,"YEAH, SHE SAID NOT TO, LIKE,"
986,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,FREAK OUT.
987,00:31:22.70,00:31:22.70,ARE YOU WEEK THAT?
988,00:31:23.63,00:31:23.63,"IF I GOT A COUPLE OF VOTES,"
989,00:31:25.60,00:31:25.60,ALL HELL WOULD BREAK LOOSE.
990,00:31:27.37,00:31:27.37,"BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, CHRISTINA'S"
991,00:31:31.10,00:31:31.10,I.Q. IS PROBABLY A 0.
992,00:31:32.30,00:31:32.30,I DON'T KNOW IF THAT EVEN
993,00:31:34.17,00:31:34.17,EXISTS.
994,00:31:34.43,00:31:34.43,"I MEAN, I'M A SPECIAL ED"
995,00:31:35.87,00:31:35.87,"TEACHER, SO I HANDLE CHRISTINA"
996,00:31:37.63,00:31:37.63,"AS ONE OF MY STUDENTS, AND SHE'S"
997,00:31:39.57,00:31:39.57,GOING TO DO WHATEVER WE TELL HER
998,00:31:40.60,00:31:40.60,TO DO.
999,00:31:42.20,00:31:42.20,AND IF TROY PULLS OUT AN
1000,00:31:44.43,00:31:44.43,"IMMUNITY IDOL, CHRISTINA'S GOING"
1001,00:31:46.40,00:31:46.40,"TO GO, AND SHE HAS TO GO, THEN"
1002,00:31:48.23,00:31:48.23,SHE HAS TO GO.
1003,00:31:49.27,00:31:49.27,"IT AIN'T MY NAME, SO I DON'T"
1004,00:31:51.37,00:31:51.37,CARE.
1005,00:31:51.63,00:31:51.63,HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
1006,00:31:54.00,00:31:54.00,I'M FEELING FINE.
1007,00:31:56.20,00:31:56.20,YEAH.
1008,00:31:58.23,00:31:58.23,"YEAH, I HOPE THAT YOU FEEL"
1009,00:32:01.90,00:32:01.90,FINE.
1010,00:32:02.20,00:32:02.20,YOU ALWAYS FEEL LIKE YOU
1011,00:32:03.27,00:32:03.27,DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
1012,00:32:04.37,00:32:04.37,THE GIRLS AND STUFF.
1013,00:32:05.87,00:32:05.87,"I'M ALWAYS, LIKE, SCARED."
1014,00:32:07.13,00:32:07.13,THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO
1015,00:32:08.77,00:32:08.77,FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ANYTHING ON
1016,00:32:09.97,00:32:09.97,WITH THEM AND FIGURE OUT THEIR
1017,00:32:12.13,00:32:12.13,PLACEMENT AND STUFF.
1018,00:32:12.83,00:32:12.83,YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE SAYING
1019,00:32:14.63,00:32:14.63,THERE'S STRATEGY BEHIND WHY
1020,00:32:15.97,00:32:15.97,THOSE GIRLS WENT THE THREE OF
1021,00:32:17.10,00:32:17.10,"THEM, AND EVERYTHING?"
1022,00:32:18.10,00:32:18.10,"IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW,"
1023,00:32:21.90,00:32:21.90,YOU HAVE TWO.
1024,00:32:22.73,00:32:22.73,"YOU HAVE KIM, AND THEN YOU HAVE"
1025,00:32:24.57,00:32:24.57,CHELSEA.
1026,00:32:25.00,00:32:25.00,I DON'T TRUST THE GIRLS 100%.
1027,00:32:26.83,00:32:26.83,SO THAT'S WHY I ENTERTAIN THE
1028,00:32:29.27,00:32:29.27,IDEA OF TROYZAN'S PROPOSAL
1029,00:32:30.83,00:32:30.83,BECAUSE IT MAKES-- IT MAKES
1030,00:32:34.43,00:32:34.43,SENSE.
1031,00:32:35.57,00:32:35.57,"KIM WON, YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR HER."
1032,00:32:37.07,00:32:37.07,"I NEVER PUT YOUR NAME DOWN, JUST"
1033,00:32:38.57,00:32:38.57,TO LET YOU OPINION
1034,00:32:39.57,00:32:39.57,( LAUGHS )
1035,00:32:41.23,00:32:41.23,"IF YOU VOTE CHELSEA, I'LL VOTE"
1036,00:32:43.57,00:32:43.57,CHELSEA.
1037,00:32:43.77,00:32:43.77,OKAY.
1038,00:32:45.03,00:32:45.03,CHRISTINA SAID SHE WOULD VOTE
1039,00:32:46.23,00:32:46.23,"FOR CHELSEA, BUT I DON'T THINK"
1040,00:32:48.00,00:32:48.00,ANYBODY ELSE WOULD VOTE FOR
1041,00:32:49.57,00:32:49.57,CHELSEA.
1042,00:32:50.03,00:32:50.03,SO NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TRY
1043,00:32:51.33,00:32:51.33,TO SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT WHO
1044,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,THEY'RE SPLITTING THIS VOTE
1045,00:32:54.10,00:32:54.10,"WITH, AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO"
1046,00:32:55.30,00:32:55.30,VOTE FOR THAT PERSON.
1047,00:32:57.00,00:32:57.00,"I MEAN, THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING"
1048,00:32:58.77,00:32:58.77,TO SPLIT VOTE BECAUSE THEY DON'T
1049,00:32:59.90,00:32:59.90,KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING.
1050,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS
1051,00:33:03.87,00:33:03.87,HOW THEY REALLY CAN SPLIT THIS
1052,00:33:05.67,00:33:05.67,VOTE.
1053,00:33:06.07,00:33:06.07,"THEY CAN PROBABLY SPLIT IT,"
1054,00:33:07.43,00:33:07.43,AND THEN THERE'S THE
1055,00:33:08.73,00:33:08.73,POSSIBILITY-- BECAUSE I HEARD MY
1056,00:33:09.83,00:33:09.83,NAME'S GOING TO BE WRITTEN DOWN
1057,00:33:10.90,00:33:10.90,AND EVERYTHING.
1058,00:33:12.80,00:33:12.80,AND--
1059,00:33:13.13,00:33:13.13,WHEN CHRISTINA SAID WHO
1060,00:33:14.70,00:33:14.70,THEY'RE GOING TO SPLIT THE VOTE
1061,00:33:17.57,00:33:17.57,"WITH-- I'M LIKE, GREAT."
1062,00:33:20.70,00:33:20.70,THAT'S EASY.
1063,00:33:21.40,00:33:21.40,I STARTED THINKING ABOUT THE
1064,00:33:22.47,00:33:22.47,"VOTE, HOW IT COULD GO."
1065,00:33:23.70,00:33:23.70,I NEED THREE PEOPLE TO JUST VOTE
1066,00:33:25.33,00:33:25.33,"FOR CHRISTINA AND THEN, BOOM, I"
1067,00:33:27.00,00:33:27.00,CAN BE THE FOURTH.
1068,00:33:28.20,00:33:28.20,AND IT CAN BE A MIRACLE.
1069,00:33:30.83,00:33:30.83,SERIOUSLY.
1070,00:33:31.43,00:33:31.43,BOOM.
1071,00:33:31.87,00:33:31.87,"ALL OF A SUDDEN, CHRISTINA'S,"
1072,00:33:34.00,00:33:34.00,"LIKE, GONE, AND THAT WOULD BE"
1073,00:33:35.60,00:33:35.60,BEAUTIFUL.
1074,00:33:35.87,00:33:35.87,IF WE ALL DO WHAT WE SAID
1075,00:33:37.60,00:33:37.60,"WE'LL DO, TROY WILL GO HOME"

1151,00:35:59.53,00:35:59.53,BUT SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WHO THINK ARE GOING TO BE YOUR TOP THREE GO VOTED OUT.
1152,00:36:02.73,00:36:02.73,PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND FLIP-FLOP.
1153,00:36:05.37,00:36:05.37,THINGS CHANGE.
1154,00:36:05.80,00:36:05.80,"Jeff: TROYZAN, THAT SOUNDS"
1155,00:36:07.37,00:36:07.37,LIKE THE KIND OF ANSWER YOU WANT

1163,00:36:18.67,00:36:18.67,BECAUSE I'M ONE LUCKY GIRL.
1164,00:36:20.27,00:36:20.27,THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
1165,00:36:24.13,00:36:24.13,"Jeff: ALICIA, WHY ARE YOU"
1166,00:36:26.43,00:36:26.43,LAUGHING?

1172,00:36:36.27,00:36:36.27,"Jeff: CHRISTINA, WHAT DID"

1176,00:36:42.07,00:36:42.07,I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
1177,00:36:42.63,00:36:42.63,BEGIN IS NO ONE REALLY GOT A
1178,00:36:44.13,00:36:44.13,CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW ME.
1179,00:36:46.17,00:36:46.17,Jeff: BUT THIS CHALLENGE
1180,00:36:47.03,00:36:47.03,WAS JUST TWO DAYS AGO.

1186,00:36:55.70,00:36:55.70,THINK YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE

1188,00:36:57.43,00:36:57.43,I THINK I DESERVE TO BE HERE
1189,00:36:58.57,00:36:58.57,JUST AS EVERYBODY ELSE.
1190,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,I--
1191,00:37:00.80,00:37:00.80,BUT I THINK THE GENERAL
1192,00:37:01.87,00:37:01.87,CONSENSUS WAS YOU DIDN'T HAVE
1193,00:37:03.27,00:37:03.27,ANY STRATEGY THROUGHOUT THE
1194,00:37:04.23,00:37:04.23,GAME.
1195,00:37:04.53,00:37:04.53,I HAVE BEEN STRATEGIZING
1196,00:37:06.47,00:37:06.47,THROUGHOUT THE GAME.
1197,00:37:07.13,00:37:07.13,I JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT
1198,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,BECAUSE THE WHOLE GAME IS ABOUT
1199,00:37:10.37,00:37:10.37,"DECEPTION AND OUTWIT, OUTPLAY,"
1200,00:37:14.17,00:37:14.17,OUTLAST.

1205,00:37:20.30,00:37:20.30,SIX WOMEN IN HER ALLIANCE.
1206,00:37:21.63,00:37:21.63,"OH, YEAH."
1207,00:37:22.47,00:37:22.47,EVERYONE KNOWS CHRISTINA'S ON
1208,00:37:24.13,00:37:24.13,THE BOTTOM.
1209,00:37:24.93,00:37:24.93,THEY'LL NEVER ADMIT THAT.
1210,00:37:26.03,00:37:26.03,BUT IT'S JUST FUNNY TO LISTEN TO

1252,00:38:22.83,00:38:22.83,I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE
