195,00:12:42.33,00:12:42.33,Eliza grabs the flag from Chet. Parvati and Eliza score the
196,00:12:46.12,00:12:46.12,first point for Airai! You all right?
197,00:12:54.21,00:12:54.21,">> PROBST: Next round, it will be Ami and Amanda chasing James"
198,00:12:57.54,00:12:57.54,"and Jason. Tied 1-1, playing to three."
199,00:13:01.21,00:13:01.21,Survivors ready? Go!
200,00:13:05.25,00:13:05.25,Ami and Amanda trying to catch James and Jason.

202,00:13:12.04,00:13:12.04,"shot at Jason. >> Hold them up, guys."
203,00:13:15.92,00:13:15.92,"Hold them up. >> PROBST: Ami's hurt, still"
204,00:13:19.12,00:13:19.12,"hanging in there. >> Go, go!"
205,00:13:23.92,00:13:23.92,">> Get him! >> PROBST: Oh, Jason tied up!"
206,00:13:28.29,00:13:28.29,Ami has a shot at it! Trying to get it!
207,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,Ami has Jason's flag! Malakal leads 2-1.
208,00:13:40.62,00:13:40.62,"Here we go, next round. Jonathan Penner and Alexis"
209,00:13:43.46,00:13:43.46,chasing after Cirie and Tracy. Malakal leads 2-1.
210,00:13:49.21,00:13:49.21,"If Cirie and Tracy can avoid being caught, Malakal wins"
211,00:13:52.33,00:13:52.33,reward. Survivors ready?
212,00:13:55.50,00:13:55.50,Go! Penner and Alexis out of the
213,00:13:59.25,00:13:59.25,gate quickly. They have one minute to catch
214,00:14:03.12,00:14:03.12,"Tracy and Cirie. Otherwise, Malakal wins reward."
215,00:14:07.38,00:14:07.38,Penner dragging Alexis. Cirie and Tracy doing a good
216,00:14:09.75,00:14:09.75,"job, staying away. Cirie dragging Tracy."
217,00:14:15.33,00:14:15.33,">> Go, go, go! >> PROBST: 30 seconds left."
218,00:14:17.75,00:14:17.75,"Penner reaches for the flag, can't get it!"
219,00:14:21.04,00:14:21.04,Alexis grabs the flag off Cirie. We are tied 2-2.
220,00:14:27.58,00:14:27.58,"Our injury tally so far-- Penner has a busted up knee, Parvati"
221,00:14:31.38,00:14:31.38,"has a busted up lip, Ami has a tweaked knee."

227,00:14:57.25,00:14:57.25,Survivors ready? >> You got them.
228,00:15:00.83,00:15:00.83,>> PROBST: Go! Parvati and Eliza just have to
229,00:15:03.92,00:15:03.92,"avoid Joel and Chet for 60 seconds, and they'll have"
230,00:15:06.88,00:15:06.88,"steaks, sausage, wine and fixings."

237,00:15:31.21,00:15:31.21,30 seconds! >> Come on!

241,00:15:43.25,00:15:43.25,"reward! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,"
242,00:15:50.04,00:15:50.04,"five, four, three, two, one. Joel and Chet cannot catch"
243,00:15:55.42,00:15:55.42,Parvati and Eliza! Airai wins reward!
244,00:16:17.75,00:16:17.75,">> PROBST: All right, Airai wins the first challenge as new"
245,00:16:20.67,00:16:20.67,tribes. Nice work.
246,00:16:22.21,00:16:22.21,"( applause ) Big reward-- steak, veggies,"
247,00:16:27.50,00:16:27.50,some wine to celebrate. >> Woo-hoo!
248,00:16:30.12,00:16:30.12,">> PROBST: Malakal, got nothing for you."
249,00:16:31.58,00:16:31.58,Grab your stuff. Head back to camp.
250,00:16:53.96,00:16:53.96,">> We've got a... back there, there's a giant cave."
251,00:16:57.46,00:16:57.46,"I'll show you guys that. >> Oh, cool."
252,00:16:59.04,00:16:59.04,Even more than what we have. >> And then we have the
253,00:17:01.25,00:17:01.25,chickens. >> I'm not good about losing.
254,00:17:04.38,00:17:04.38,I know that's where my temper gets to me.
255,00:17:06.17,00:17:06.17,And I'm still decompressing. Maybe this is poetic justice in
256,00:17:10.83,00:17:10.83,"some form, because I chose to get rid of Mikey versus Chet."
257,00:17:16.21,00:17:16.21,"And now here I end up with Chet again on my tribe, who's"
258,00:17:19.38,00:17:19.38,probably the weakest of both the tribes.
259,00:17:22.96,00:17:22.96,">> Erik, are you coming? >> You know, there is a little"
260,00:17:25.25,00:17:25.25,"bit of irony in that. But at the same time, it can be"
261,00:17:27.92,00:17:27.92,good to have people around that ultimately will be expendable.
262,00:17:32.25,00:17:32.25,">> Oh, my god! >> When it rains, this is the"
263,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,"place to be. >> Yeah, it's all dry here."
264,00:17:39.17,00:17:39.17,">> Yeah. >> Oh, this is wonderful."
265,00:17:40.67,00:17:40.67,>> It's ridiculously dry here. I am so excited to be on this
266,00:17:43.46,00:17:43.46,tribe right now. I like these people on this
267,00:17:45.42,00:17:45.42,"tribe. I mean, I got to meet Ozzy"
268,00:17:46.96,00:17:46.96,"today! At this point, the game has"
269,00:17:48.88,00:17:48.88,"changed completely. Now, rather than being with the"
270,00:17:51.08,00:17:51.08,"fans, I'm with some of the favorites."
271,00:17:53.21,00:17:53.21,But I'm going to try and not let that cloud my judgment.
272,00:17:55.38,00:17:55.38,They're still people in this game.
273,00:17:57.92,00:17:57.92,>> And then we use half of it as a blanket.
274,00:17:59.83,00:17:59.83,"We sleep on this half, and then we pull that up."
275,00:18:01.67,00:18:01.67,">> You don't understand. We had nothing, so..."
276,00:18:05.42,00:18:05.42,">> That's why, like, you know, it really sucks to lose the"
277,00:18:08.79,00:18:08.79,"challenge today, but it's one meal."
278,00:18:12.25,00:18:12.25,"It's one nice meal. But you know, we're going to be"
279,00:18:14.83,00:18:14.83,eating. I feel like we do have an
280,00:18:17.12,00:18:17.12,"advantage because we're on the Malakal beach, and we have all"
281,00:18:20.17,00:18:20.17,of the things that you need to be a strong tribe.
282,00:18:23.21,00:18:23.21,>> Thank God I can hug you now. >> It's just a question of are
283,00:18:26.83,00:18:26.83,"we going to be a strong tribe? Chet, man, he's like a sack of"
284,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17,"potatoes. In the challenge, he freaking"
285,00:18:35.25,00:18:35.25,"gave up. Like, he just... he was, like,"
286,00:18:37.92,00:18:37.92,being dragged. He wouldn't even stand up.
287,00:18:39.58,00:18:39.58,I just don't see him being a strong competitor at all.
288,00:18:42.58,00:18:42.58,"I don't know what's going on with that dude, but he needs to"
289,00:18:44.88,00:18:44.88,go. >> Lift up.
290,00:18:51.92,00:18:51.92,I've always liked chickens. I've raised chickens all my
291,00:18:54.12,00:18:54.12,"life, so I pretty much know everything about chickens."
292,00:18:56.25,00:18:56.25,"They're very, you know, peaceful animals."
293,00:18:58.21,00:18:58.21,"They're very placid. But, you know, they have their"
294,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,"own pecking order-- literally, a pecking order-- where the"
295,00:19:04.21,00:19:04.21,weakest one is always basically pecked on until they're killed--
296,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,the same as pretty much in this game of Survivor.
297,00:19:11.54,00:19:11.54,The weaker one is usually pecked on until they're removed from
298,00:19:13.88,00:19:13.88,the tribe. >> Then this is where our fire
299,00:19:25.62,00:19:25.62,"is. So... and then we made, like, a"
300,00:19:27.88,00:19:27.88,little... >> So this is the shelter?
301,00:19:29.25,00:19:29.25,">> This was Chet, mine, and Tracy's."
302,00:19:31.33,00:19:31.33,We build... we had to build this one.
303,00:19:33.46,00:19:33.46,"This slept us three, and those slept seven."
304,00:19:38.75,00:19:38.75,>> So you guys sleep on the beach with these things jumping
305,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17,"all over you? >> Yeah, it's pretty gross."
306,00:19:43.29,00:19:43.29,>> Wow. >> The Airai camp is pretty much
307,00:19:47.04,00:19:47.04,a disaster. The beach is not as good as our
308,00:19:50.29,00:19:50.29,"beach. Kathy, move that up a little,"
309,00:19:52.88,00:19:52.88,because the tide is starting to come up behind you.
310,00:19:55.21,00:19:55.21,Even though winning the food reward of steaks and spices and
311,00:19:58.54,00:19:58.54,"wine was great, at Malakal, we had everything."
312,00:20:02.62,00:20:02.62,"And here, we pretty much have nothing."
313,00:20:05.33,00:20:05.33,It's definitely a downgrade in terms of camp life.
314,00:20:09.96,00:20:09.96,>> I'm so happy. It's nice to have things kind of
315,00:20:11.96,00:20:11.96,shaken up. So it's good to get to know more
316,00:20:14.29,00:20:14.29,people. >> Whoa!
317,00:20:18.12,00:20:18.12,Not good. >> Can it get up that high that
318,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,it's going to put our fire out? >> Yeah.
319,00:20:22.96,00:20:22.96,">> The water hasn't come into your shelter, has it?"
320,00:20:24.75,00:20:24.75,">> Not yet. >> Oh, just to hear that"
321,00:20:27.38,00:20:27.38,sizzling sound is great! >> So good right now!
322,00:20:31.50,00:20:31.50,">> Oh, my gosh. Here comes the water."
323,00:20:34.08,00:20:34.08,>> Ah! >> No.
324,00:20:37.58,00:20:37.58,"No, it did not. >> No, it didn't."
325,00:20:39.79,00:20:39.79,It did? No.
326,00:20:41.54,00:20:41.54,">> The old Airai, the setup that they were living in was"
327,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,terrible. The waters are washing away the
328,00:20:46.67,00:20:46.67,"fire, you know. I'm amazed that they're still"
329,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,"alive, poor things. They should be dead."
330,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,"I mean, they're a bunch of dingbats."
331,00:20:55.25,00:20:55.25,"More wood, huh? >> It went really deep."
332,00:20:59.96,00:20:59.96,>> Yeah. Oh.
333,00:21:02.83,00:21:02.83,">> Well, my knee's a little screwy."
334,00:21:04.58,00:21:04.58,"I was on the course in the challenge, punctured it somehow."
335,00:21:08.12,00:21:08.12,"There was some sharp something, went right into my muscle."
336,00:21:14.08,00:21:14.08,A lot of people got fat lips and twisted knees and stuff like
337,00:21:16.58,00:21:16.58,"that, and I found a stick, and it went straight into my leg."
338,00:21:22.38,00:21:22.38,I'm gimping around like I'm Quasimoto.
339,00:21:27.38,00:21:27.38,It's painfully sore. I really tweaked the hell out of
340,00:21:30.21,00:21:30.21,it. Oh.
341,00:21:44.08,00:21:44.08,"It's not too late to suture, right?"
342,00:21:47.21,00:21:47.21,It's all right? And... and... argh!
343,00:21:53.08,00:21:53.08,Ah! >> A little one again.
344,00:22:03.12,00:22:03.12,>> Ow! Damn it!
345,00:22:06.50,00:22:06.50,Ah. It hurts!
346,00:22:23.21,00:22:23.21,>> Ow! God!
347,00:22:26.46,00:22:26.46,It's crazy! I'm in the middle of the
348,00:22:29.25,00:22:29.25,freaking jungle. A wonderful doctor came out to
349,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,"the beach and cleaned my wound and stitched it up, and they"
350,00:22:37.50,00:22:37.50,left me with three stitches and a painful leg.
351,00:22:41.83,00:22:41.83,>> He's going to live. >> Are you all right then?
352,00:22:44.50,00:22:44.50,">> Oh, I'm fine. There could be an infection, and"
353,00:22:48.38,00:22:48.38,it could work down towards the joint of my knee.
354,00:22:51.25,00:22:51.25,So let's hope it doesn't get worse.
355,00:23:34.12,00:23:34.12,>> Ozzy is amazing. The kid can swim like crazy.
356,00:23:38.12,00:23:38.12,He's natural in the water. That's just... that's just how
357,00:23:40.08,00:23:40.08,"he was born, and there's nothing to it other than that."
358,00:23:43.04,00:23:43.04,"I mean, I can't compete with him."
359,00:23:45.04,00:23:45.04,He's amazing. >> We are in a really good
360,00:23:50.12,00:23:50.12,"position over here, because I think we have a really strong"
361,00:23:53.00,00:23:53.00,"tribe, aside from maybe one person."
362,00:23:56.08,00:23:56.08,>> Yeah. >> What are you thinking?
363,00:23:58.08,00:23:58.08,>> You're obviously thinking something.
364,00:23:59.58,00:23:59.58,">> I'm just thinking Chet, and then after that, between Tracy"
365,00:24:03.75,00:24:03.75,"and Cirie, which, I mean, I don't know."
366,00:24:06.38,00:24:06.38,>> I'll tell you what. If you're willing to get rid of
367,00:24:08.96,00:24:08.96,"Cirie first, I got no problem giving up Chet and then being"
368,00:24:13.21,00:24:13.21,"back to 3-3, calling that fair. >> After we were out on the"
369,00:24:17.50,00:24:17.50,"water, we had a little conversation on the beach"
370,00:24:19.62,00:24:19.62,"between mainly Joel and Ozzy, and I kind of listened in."
371,00:24:22.92,00:24:22.92,And it was kind of like two superpowers kind of discussing
372,00:24:27.12,00:24:27.12,"terms. >> You know, being completely"
373,00:24:30.62,00:24:30.62,"legitimate, our concern is that there's four from the favorites"
374,00:24:33.42,00:24:33.42,"and four from the fans, and the first one to go down to three is"
375,00:24:35.54,00:24:35.54,kind of... >> Screwed.
376,00:24:37.42,00:24:37.42,">> You know, unless something changes."
377,00:24:39.92,00:24:39.92,">> Well, if we can trust each other..."

535,00:33:01.33,00:33:01.33,"that way. I don't think I've ever, in my"

551,00:34:16.96,00:34:16.96,>> Okay. >> Erik seems to think that we
552,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,"should get rid of the weaker players in the tribe, which"
553,00:34:29.33,00:34:29.33,"would be fine with me, except I'm included in the weaker tribe"

561,00:35:00.33,00:35:00.33,"win today. >> Right now, I have to convince"
562,00:35:08.42,00:35:08.42,Ozzy and Amanda that Joel is a bigger threat for us than Chet
563,00:35:11.67,00:35:11.67,is. >> ...then we'll have Joel.

565,00:35:20.25,00:35:20.25,We'll be able to decide who to send to Exile.
566,00:35:24.46,00:35:24.46,>> You think Joel is really that great helping us win?
567,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,He didn't help us win today. He didn't hit one tile.
568,00:35:30.12,00:35:30.12,Big as he is... >> That's true.
569,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,>> ...he should have hit something.
570,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"Tracy is, like, this big and hit more tiles than he did."
571,00:35:36.29,00:35:36.29,>> I know. >> He didn't do nothing but
572,00:35:38.00,00:35:38.00,"screw us up in the puzzle. >> Like, I mean, he's still,"
573,00:35:40.17,00:35:40.17,"like, a mover and a shaker. Chet's nothing and a nothing."
574,00:35:43.46,00:35:43.46,>> But Joel is already playing the game.
575,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,Chet ain't really into playing the game like that.
576,00:35:48.62,00:35:48.62,"There are so many pluses for getting rid of Joel, and Chet is"
577,00:35:52.54,00:35:52.54,just like a pawn. We can use Chet for whatever we
578,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00,need whenever we need. >> That's true.
579,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,>> Joel you can't do that with. >> That makes sense.
580,00:35:59.29,00:35:59.29,This is an incredibly important vote tonight.
581,00:36:01.62,00:36:01.62,We are at a crossroads. We are at a point where we need
582,00:36:05.58,00:36:05.58,to decide how we're going to approach the rest of the game.
583,00:36:08.88,00:36:08.88,"Chet, in challenges, he is a waste of space."
584,00:36:12.38,00:36:12.38,"On the other hand, Joel wants to win challenges, but Joel wants"
585,00:36:15.21,00:36:15.21,"to win the game really bad, and Joel is dangerous."
586,00:36:19.25,00:36:19.25,It's a hard decision. >> PROBST: So let's talk about
587,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,"the switch. Ozzy, you and Natalie were"
588,00:36:45.88,00:36:45.88,"selected as captains. Natalie had the first choice,"
589,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,immediately took James. You countered with Joel.
590,00:36:51.58,00:36:51.58,Was that to match up size for size?
591,00:36:53.88,00:36:53.88,>> Yeah. It just seemed like the logical
592,00:36:56.25,00:36:56.25,choice at the time to try and match James's strength with
593,00:36:58.83,00:36:58.83,"Joel's. >> PROBST: On the flip side,"
594,00:37:01.96,00:37:01.96,"Chet, you really weren't even picked."
595,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,You were left over and ended up on this tribe.
596,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,Does that work on your psyche at all about where you fit in this
597,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,"game? >> Um, you know, I felt like I"
598,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,"was in trouble from day one in this game, but I'm still sitting"
599,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,"here. And of course, it's not the"
600,00:37:17.29,00:37:17.29,"greatest to be picked last, but that was the group of people I"
601,00:37:20.08,00:37:20.08,"wanted to end up with, whether they chose me or whether I went"
602,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,"there by default, so I was very happy with the results, no"
603,00:37:25.04,00:37:25.04,"matter what. >> PROBST: Tracy, let's talk"
604,00:37:27.75,00:37:27.75,about the challenge where you were dragging each other through
605,00:37:30.25,00:37:30.25,the mud. It was your first time together
606,00:37:32.71,00:37:32.71,as a new group. What do you think?
607,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,">> I think that watching Joel and Chet, if there had just been"
608,00:37:37.92,00:37:37.92,a smidgen of communication for the guy he was dragging around
609,00:37:41.25,00:37:41.25,"behind him, then we almost would have had it."
610,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,If somebody with you can't walk or gets their head whopped
611,00:37:46.54,00:37:46.54,"against a board and they can't see, putting your feet down and"
612,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,"pulling like a Clydesdale, you know, is just not going to get"
613,00:37:51.96,00:37:51.96,"it done. >> PROBST: Joel, obviously,"
614,00:37:54.04,00:37:54.04,Tracy's talking about you and the way you were dragging Chet
615,00:37:56.08,00:37:56.08,around like he was a bundle of bananas.
616,00:37:58.08,00:37:58.08,>> Yeah. What do you want me to say?
617,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,"There was communication. If I was going under, I said,"
618,00:38:04.29,00:38:04.29,"""Under."" If I was going through, I said,"
619,00:38:06.12,00:38:06.12,"""Through."" Don't shake your head."
620,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,"If I was going over, I said, ""Over."""
621,00:38:10.62,00:38:10.62,If he couldn't hear me because there was mud in his ears from
622,00:38:12.54,00:38:12.54,"being dragged through it, it's not my fault."
623,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,">> PROBST: Chet, what was your experience being the one behind,"
624,00:38:18.50,00:38:18.50,"being dragged? >> First off, I felt like I was"
625,00:38:21.04,00:38:21.04,harnessed to a Mack truck and drug through the forest.
626,00:38:23.92,00:38:23.92,"And when somebody is making up their mind in a split second,"
627,00:38:26.62,00:38:26.62,you do end up getting smashed into posts.
628,00:38:28.67,00:38:28.67,And there wasn't as much communication in the last aspect
629,00:38:31.67,00:38:31.67,of that challenge for us as there was in the beginning for
630,00:38:33.67,00:38:33.67,"us. >> PROBST: Erik, tonight's vote,"
631,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,is this about keeping a tribe strong so we can win in
632,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,"challenges, or is it four fans, four favorites, somebody's going"
633,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,to win out? >> When you bring the two groups
634,00:38:44.29,00:38:44.29,"together, there is that initial thought, the fans versus the"
635,00:38:47.08,00:38:47.08,"favorites still. But at this point, I think most"
636,00:38:50.08,00:38:50.08,of us are looking at this as we just need to stay strong.
637,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to vote."
638,00:38:56.79,00:38:56.79,"Erik, you're up. >> I'm voting for Chet tonight."
639,00:39:09.54,00:39:09.54,"We want to stay strong as a tribe, and take it easy."
640,00:39:34.54,00:39:34.54,>> This is because you called me weak one too many times.
641,00:39:57.67,00:39:57.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
642,00:40:07.29,00:40:07.29,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
643,00:40:09.08,00:40:09.08,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
644,00:40:14.12,00:40:14.12,"Okay. Once the votes are read, the"
645,00:40:15.79,00:40:15.79,decision is final. The person voted out will be
646,00:40:17.46,00:40:17.46,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
647,00:40:19.42,00:40:19.42,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Joel."
648,00:40:28.79,00:40:28.79,"Chet. One vote Joel, one vote Chet."
649,00:40:33.50,00:40:33.50,"Chet. Two votes Chet, one vote Joel."
650,00:40:40.17,00:40:40.17,"Joel. Two vote Joel, two votes Chet."
651,00:40:46.88,00:40:46.88,"Joel. That's three votes Joel, two"
652,00:40:48.54,00:40:48.54,votes Chet. Joel.
653,00:40:54.62,00:40:54.62,"That's four votes Joel, two votes Chet."
654,00:41:02.46,00:41:02.46,"Fifth person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,"
655,00:41:05.38,00:41:05.38,Joel. That's five.
656,00:41:07.42,00:41:07.42,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
657,00:41:12.25,00:41:12.25,">> Hey, big guy. >> PROBST: Joel, the tribe has"
658,00:41:22.12,00:41:22.12,spoken. Time for you to go.
659,00:41:33.12,00:41:33.12,">> Wow. >> PROBST: Well, tonight's vote"
660,00:41:40.88,00:41:40.88,"established what is important to this tribe, and clearly,"
661,00:41:44.29,00:41:44.29,"physical strength, not at the top of the list."
662,00:41:47.04,00:41:47.04,Certainly caught Joel by surprise.
663,00:41:49.00,00:41:49.00,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

677,00:42:42.21,00:42:42.21,Wow. I don't understand why you would
678,00:42:44.54,00:42:44.54,"want to keep somebody like Chet. It's just very, very confusing."
