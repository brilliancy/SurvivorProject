270,00:17:53.21,00:17:53.21,But I'm going to try and not letthat cloud my judgment.

278,00:18:14.83,00:18:14.83,eating.I feel like we do have an
279,00:18:17.12,00:18:17.12,"advantage because we're on theMalakal beach, and we have all"
280,00:18:20.17,00:18:20.17,of the things that you need tobe a strong tribe.
281,00:18:23.21,00:18:23.21,>> Thank God I can hug you now.>> It's just a question of are
282,00:18:26.83,00:18:26.83,"we going to be a strong tribe?Chet, man, he's like a sack of"
283,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17,"potatoes.In the challenge, he freaking"
284,00:18:35.25,00:18:35.25,"gave up.Like, he just... he was, like,"
285,00:18:37.92,00:18:37.92,being dragged.He wouldn't even stand up.
286,00:18:39.58,00:18:39.58,I just don't see him being astrong competitor at all.
287,00:18:42.58,00:18:42.58,"I don't know what's going onwith that dude, but he needs to"
288,00:18:44.88,00:18:44.88,go.>> Lift up.
289,00:18:51.92,00:18:51.92,I've always liked chickens.I've raised chickens all my

292,00:18:58.21,00:18:58.21,"They're very placid.But, you know, they have their"

294,00:19:04.21,00:19:04.21,weakest one is always basicallypecked on until they're killed--
295,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,the same as pretty much in thisgame of Survivor.
296,00:19:11.54,00:19:11.54,The weaker one is usually peckedon until they're removed from
297,00:19:13.88,00:19:13.88,the tribe.>> Then this is where our fire
298,00:19:25.62,00:19:25.62,"is.So... and then we made, like, a"
299,00:19:27.88,00:19:27.88,little...>> So this is the shelter?
300,00:19:29.25,00:19:29.25,">> This was Chet, mine, andTracy's."
301,00:19:31.33,00:19:31.33,We build... we had to build thisone.
302,00:19:33.46,00:19:33.46,"This slept us three, and thoseslept seven."
303,00:19:38.75,00:19:38.75,>> So you guys sleep on thebeach with these things jumping
304,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17,"all over you?>> Yeah, it's pretty gross."
305,00:19:43.29,00:19:43.29,>> Wow.>> The Airai camp is pretty much
306,00:19:47.04,00:19:47.04,a disaster.The beach is not as good as our
307,00:19:50.29,00:19:50.29,"beach.Kathy, move that up a little,"
308,00:19:52.88,00:19:52.88,because the tide is starting tocome up behind you.
309,00:19:55.21,00:19:55.21,Even though winning the foodreward of steaks and spices and
310,00:19:58.54,00:19:58.54,"wine was great, at Malakal, wehad everything."
311,00:20:02.62,00:20:02.62,"And here, we pretty much havenothing."
312,00:20:05.33,00:20:05.33,It's definitely a downgrade interms of camp life.
313,00:20:09.96,00:20:09.96,>> I'm so happy.It's nice to have things kind of
314,00:20:11.96,00:20:11.96,shaken up.So it's good to get to know more
315,00:20:14.29,00:20:14.29,people.>> Whoa!
316,00:20:18.12,00:20:18.12,Not good.>> Can it get up that high that
317,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,it's going to put our fire out?>> Yeah.
318,00:20:22.96,00:20:22.96,">> The water hasn't come intoyour shelter, has it?"
319,00:20:24.75,00:20:24.75,">> Not yet.>> Oh, just to hear that"
320,00:20:27.38,00:20:27.38,sizzling sound is great!>> So good right now!

326,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,terrible.The waters are washing away the

328,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,"alive, poor things.They should be dead."
329,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,"I mean, they're a bunch ofdingbats."
330,00:20:55.25,00:20:55.25,"More wood, huh?>> It went really deep."
331,00:20:59.96,00:20:59.96,>> Yeah.Oh.

335,00:21:14.08,00:21:14.08,A lot of people got fat lips andtwisted knees and stuff like
336,00:21:16.58,00:21:16.58,"that, and I found a stick, andit went straight into my leg."
337,00:21:22.38,00:21:22.38,I'm gimping around like I'mQuasimoto.
338,00:21:27.38,00:21:27.38,It's painfully sore.I really tweaked the hell out of

340,00:21:44.08,00:21:44.08,"It's not too late to suture,right?"
341,00:21:47.21,00:21:47.21,It's all right?And... and... argh!
342,00:21:53.08,00:21:53.08,Ah!>> A little one again.

349,00:22:37.50,00:22:37.50,left me with three stitches anda painful leg.

353,00:22:51.25,00:22:51.25,So let's hope it doesn't getworse.

564,00:35:20.25,00:35:20.25,We'll be able to decide who tosend to Exile.
565,00:35:24.46,00:35:24.46,>> You think Joel is really thatgreat helping us win?
566,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,He didn't help us win today.He didn't hit one tile.
567,00:35:30.12,00:35:30.12,Big as he is...>> That's true.
568,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,>> ...he should have hitsomething.
569,00:35:33.50,00:35:33.50,"Tracy is, like, this big and hitmore tiles than he did."
570,00:35:36.29,00:35:36.29,>> I know.>> He didn't do nothing but
571,00:35:38.00,00:35:38.00,"screw us up in the puzzle.>> Like, I mean, he's still,"
572,00:35:40.17,00:35:40.17,"like, a mover and a shaker.Chet's nothing and a nothing."
573,00:35:43.46,00:35:43.46,>> But Joel is already playingthe game.
574,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,Chet ain't really into playingthe game like that.
575,00:35:48.62,00:35:48.62,"There are so many pluses forgetting rid of Joel, and Chet is"
576,00:35:52.54,00:35:52.54,just like a pawn.We can use Chet for whatever we
577,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00,need whenever we need.>> That's true.
578,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,>> Joel you can't do that with.>> That makes sense.
579,00:35:59.29,00:35:59.29,This is an incredibly importantvote tonight.
580,00:36:01.62,00:36:01.62,We are at a crossroads.We are at a point where we need
581,00:36:05.58,00:36:05.58,to decide how we're going toapproach the rest of the game.
582,00:36:08.88,00:36:08.88,"Chet, in challenges, he is awaste of space."
583,00:36:12.38,00:36:12.38,"On the other hand, Joel wants towin challenges, but Joel wants"
584,00:36:15.21,00:36:15.21,"to win the game really bad, andJoel is dangerous."
585,00:36:19.25,00:36:19.25,It's a hard decision.>> PROBST: So let's talk about
586,00:36:44.08,00:36:44.08,"the switch.Ozzy, you and Natalie were"
587,00:36:45.88,00:36:45.88,"selected as captains.Natalie had the first choice,"
588,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,immediately took James.You countered with Joel.
589,00:36:51.58,00:36:51.58,Was that to match up size forsize?
590,00:36:53.88,00:36:53.88,>> Yeah.It just seemed like the logical
591,00:36:56.25,00:36:56.25,choice at the time to try andmatch James's strength with
592,00:36:58.83,00:36:58.83,"Joel's.>> PROBST: On the flip side,"
593,00:37:01.96,00:37:01.96,"Chet, you really weren't evenpicked."
594,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,You were left over and ended upon this tribe.
595,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,Does that work on your psyche atall about where you fit in this
596,00:37:09.42,00:37:09.42,"game?>> Um, you know, I felt like I"
597,00:37:12.17,00:37:12.17,"was in trouble from day one inthis game, but I'm still sitting"
598,00:37:15.08,00:37:15.08,"here.And of course, it's not the"
599,00:37:17.29,00:37:17.29,"greatest to be picked last, butthat was the group of people I"
600,00:37:20.08,00:37:20.08,"wanted to end up with, whetherthey chose me or whether I went"
601,00:37:22.75,00:37:22.75,"there by default, so I was veryhappy with the results, no"
602,00:37:25.04,00:37:25.04,"matter what.>> PROBST: Tracy, let's talk"
603,00:37:27.75,00:37:27.75,about the challenge where youwere dragging each other through
604,00:37:30.25,00:37:30.25,the mud.It was your first time together
605,00:37:32.71,00:37:32.71,as a new group.What do you think?
606,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,">> I think that watching Joeland Chet, if there had just been"
607,00:37:37.92,00:37:37.92,a smidgen of communication forthe guy he was dragging around
608,00:37:41.25,00:37:41.25,"behind him, then we almost wouldhave had it."
609,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,If somebody with you can't walkor gets their head whopped
610,00:37:46.54,00:37:46.54,"against a board and they can'tsee, putting your feet down and"
611,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,"pulling like a Clydesdale, youknow, is just not going to get"
612,00:37:51.96,00:37:51.96,"it done.>> PROBST: Joel, obviously,"
613,00:37:54.04,00:37:54.04,Tracy's talking about you andthe way you were dragging Chet
614,00:37:56.08,00:37:56.08,around like he was a bundle ofbananas.
615,00:37:58.08,00:37:58.08,>> Yeah.What do you want me to say?
616,00:38:01.17,00:38:01.17,"There was communication.If I was going under, I said,"
617,00:38:04.29,00:38:04.29,"""Under.""If I was going through, I said,"
618,00:38:06.12,00:38:06.12,"""Through.""Don't shake your head."
619,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,"If I was going over, I said,""Over."""
620,00:38:10.62,00:38:10.62,If he couldn't hear me becausethere was mud in his ears from
621,00:38:12.54,00:38:12.54,"being dragged through it, it'snot my fault."
622,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,">> PROBST: Chet, what was yourexperience being the one behind,"
623,00:38:18.50,00:38:18.50,"being dragged?>> First off, I felt like I was"
624,00:38:21.04,00:38:21.04,harnessed to a Mack truck anddrug through the forest.
625,00:38:23.92,00:38:23.92,"And when somebody is making uptheir mind in a split second,"
626,00:38:26.62,00:38:26.62,you do end up getting smashedinto posts.
627,00:38:28.67,00:38:28.67,And there wasn't as muchcommunication in the last aspect
628,00:38:31.67,00:38:31.67,of that challenge for us asthere was in the beginning for
629,00:38:33.67,00:38:33.67,"us.>> PROBST: Erik, tonight's vote,"
630,00:38:36.50,00:38:36.50,is this about keeping a tribestrong so we can win in
631,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,"challenges, or is it four fans,four favorites, somebody's going"
632,00:38:42.12,00:38:42.12,to win out?>> When you bring the two groups
633,00:38:44.29,00:38:44.29,"together, there is that initialthought, the fans versus the"
634,00:38:47.08,00:38:47.08,"favorites still.But at this point, I think most"
635,00:38:50.08,00:38:50.08,of us are looking at this as wejust need to stay strong.
636,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,">> PROBST: All right, it is timeto vote."
637,00:38:56.79,00:38:56.79,"Erik, you're up.>> I'm voting for Chet tonight."
638,00:39:09.54,00:39:09.54,"We want to stay strong as atribe, and take it easy."
639,00:39:34.54,00:39:34.54,>> This is because you called meweak one too many times.
640,00:39:57.67,00:39:57.67,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
641,00:40:07.29,00:40:07.29,If anybody has the hiddenimmunity idol and you want to
642,00:40:09.08,00:40:09.08,"play it, now would be the timeto do so."
643,00:40:14.12,00:40:14.12,"Okay.Once the votes are read, the"
644,00:40:15.79,00:40:15.79,decision is final.The person voted out will be
645,00:40:17.46,00:40:17.46,asked to leave the tribalcouncil area immediately.
646,00:40:19.42,00:40:19.42,"I'll read the votes.First vote, Joel."

655,00:41:07.42,00:41:07.42,That's enough.You need to bring me your torch.

661,00:41:47.04,00:41:47.04,Certainly caught Joel bysurprise.
