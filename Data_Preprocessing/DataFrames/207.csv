2,00:00:03.70,00:00:03.70,"Three days before the merge, Kucha had a one-member advantage"
3,00:00:07.87,00:00:07.87,"over Ogakor. >> NICK: It's a huge advantage,"
4,00:00:10.50,00:00:10.50,because the pressure is on them to win the next challenge.
5,00:00:12.63,00:00:12.63,>> JEFF: And it looked like they might regain their winning
6,00:00:14.97,00:00:14.97,streak when Nick led them to victory in the reward challenge.
7,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57,>> NICK: We are a very cocky group.
8,00:00:21.37,00:00:21.37,"It's fun to have them talk about how hungry they are, and us"
9,00:00:25.73,00:00:25.73,going there and win all their food.
10,00:00:27.30,00:00:27.30,>> JEFF: Ogakor couldn't hide their frustration.
11,00:00:29.83,00:00:29.83,>> JERRI: The other tribe will probably just pick us off one by
12,00:00:31.67,00:00:31.67,one. >> JEFF: But before the immunity
13,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,"challenge could take place, the game took a violent twist,"
14,00:00:39.33,00:00:39.33,"Michael passed out in the fire, and was severely burned."
15,00:00:42.13,00:00:42.13,">> ( Michael groaning ) >> MICHAEL: Kucha, you guys"
16,00:00:44.80,00:00:44.80,know what to do. >> JERRI: There has been an
17,00:00:47.33,00:00:47.33,"accident at the Kucha camp, and one of their members has been"
18,00:00:49.07,00:00:49.07,evacuated. >> JEFF: Michael's evacuation
19,00:00:52.93,00:00:52.93,"leaves Kucha and Ogakor even, with five members each."
20,00:00:56.00,00:00:56.00,"Tonight, will new strategies and new friendships be born as the"
21,00:01:00.17,00:01:00.17,two tribes merge into one? Who will be the first person
22,00:01:03.67,00:01:03.67,voted out of the new tribe? >> They've been handed a gift.
23,00:02:20.73,00:02:20.73,"They are going into this with an advantage, because we were"
24,00:02:24.73,00:02:24.73,supposed to be one up on them anyway.
25,00:02:26.23,00:02:26.23,"They were about to be voted off one by one, and they know it."
26,00:02:28.73,00:02:28.73,">> JEFF V.: For the last three weeks, we've been competing with"
27,00:02:31.20,00:02:31.20,another tribe. At this point we get down to ten
28,00:02:34.13,00:02:34.13,"total people, and we come together and merge into one"
29,00:02:35.77,00:02:35.77,tribe. >> KIMMI: It blows my mind to
30,00:02:38.97,00:02:38.97,even picture any sort of loyalty toward...
31,00:02:40.43,00:02:40.43,I don't even know them. We have been through so much
32,00:02:42.07,00:02:42.07,together. >> JEFF V.: We've talked about
33,00:02:45.17,00:02:45.17,strategy and how we were going to merge with this other team
34,00:02:47.70,00:02:47.70,"ever since Mike got hurt, because the last thing that he"
35,00:02:50.43,00:02:50.43,said to us as he left was that somebody from Kucha needs to
36,00:02:53.10,00:02:53.10,"take this money. And regardless of what happens,"
37,00:02:56.27,00:02:56.27,we need to eat 'em up and spit 'em out.
38,00:02:58.73,00:02:58.73,>> ALICIA: This is going to have to get ugly if we really want
39,00:03:00.80,00:03:00.80,"this thing to work. >> The first vote, we have to do"
40,00:03:03.10,00:03:03.10,something to get an advantage. >> NICK: It's going to depend on
41,00:03:05.33,00:03:05.33,"that first vote, and it's smooth sailing from there."
42,00:03:07.40,00:03:07.40,">> You hit it on the head, son. >> ELISABETH: If I had to vote"
43,00:03:10.30,00:03:10.30,"right now, I'd vote Colby, and I'd vote Jerri next."
44,00:03:13.27,00:03:13.27,>> ALICIA: It's got to be Jerri and Colby first.
45,00:03:15.40,00:03:15.40,>> JEFF V.: My instinct says Tina was the guiding force.
46,00:03:17.80,00:03:17.80,When I was standing in that number one circle and I was
47,00:03:20.03,00:03:20.03,"quizzing her, and the way she was answering my questions just"
48,00:03:22.57,00:03:22.57,"told me that she was putting on a face, and was a shrewd woman."
49,00:03:25.80,00:03:25.80,>> JEFF V.: We were just trying to figure out who probably is
50,00:03:28.77,00:03:28.77,"Ogakor's weak link, and maybe we can convince them to come over"
51,00:03:31.57,00:03:31.57,and vote on our side. >> ALICIA: Tina will not turn on
52,00:03:33.93,00:03:33.93,"her team. >> JEFF V.: No, I know Tina"
53,00:03:36.33,00:03:36.33,won't turn. >> ALICIA: There's no way.
54,00:03:38.67,00:03:38.67,>> Most likely to turn is Keith. >> Keith and Amber.
55,00:03:41.03,00:03:41.03,>> ALICIA: I just think Nick and I are going to have to be ready
56,00:03:43.70,00:03:43.70,for anything 'cause he and I are going to be the first ones.
57,00:03:46.00,00:03:46.00,">> KIMMI: See, I think they'll be gunnin' for me."
58,00:03:47.90,00:03:47.90,>> JEFF V.: Listen to you all talking.
59,00:03:48.63,00:03:48.63,"It's me. Plus, Kimmi on the first reward"
60,00:03:50.67,00:03:50.67,"challenge. They asked who Debb voted for,"
61,00:03:54.70,00:03:54.70,"and Kimmi said Jeff, so they know that I have a vote against"
62,00:03:56.43,00:03:56.43,me. We're anticipating a five to
63,00:04:00.63,00:04:00.63,"five tie in the first vote. And in the rules, when there's a"
64,00:04:04.07,00:04:04.07,"deadlock tie, the person with the most votes accumulated to"
65,00:04:07.23,00:04:07.23,that point is the one to leave. >> NICK: I had totally forgotten
66,00:04:09.97,00:04:09.97,about that. >> JEFF V.: It's never left my
67,00:04:11.60,00:04:11.60,mind. >> RODGER: If they remember
68,00:04:12.73,00:04:12.73,"that... >> JEFF V.: But then again,"
69,00:04:15.07,00:04:15.07,"that's a vote against me, so it wouldn't leave my mind."
70,00:04:17.07,00:04:17.07,( laughter ) >> ELISABETH: What happens then?
71,00:04:20.10,00:04:20.10,">> I would be, like, forget about it."
72,00:04:36.50,00:04:36.50,>> COLBY: Yesterday everything was canceled because of the
73,00:04:38.73,00:04:38.73,"accident with Kucha. You know, you're just left with"
74,00:04:42.07,00:04:42.07,days that seem like there's at least 19 to 20 hours of
75,00:04:44.33,00:04:44.33,daylight. We have no idea what's going
76,00:04:47.97,00:04:47.97,"on, and we have no idea how drastic or serious the situation"
77,00:04:50.80,00:04:50.80,is with Kucha. >> TINA: It's so unfortunate.
78,00:04:53.90,00:04:53.90,">> COLBY: Automatically, we assume the worst... horrible."
79,00:04:56.43,00:04:56.43,The worst part about this is waiting around for information.
80,00:04:59.80,00:04:59.80,">> TINA: It's like getting a phone call from the hospital,"
81,00:05:02.33,00:05:02.33,"saying, ""Oh, we've got him here, but can't tell you what's"
82,00:05:04.33,00:05:04.33,"wrong."" >> JERRI: You don't think Rodger"
83,00:05:06.30,00:05:06.30,had a stroke or anything? ( Tina gasps dramatically )
84,00:05:09.43,00:05:09.43,">> TINA: Oh, my gosh. >> COLBY: We don't know"
85,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10,anything. We don't know when we're
86,00:05:16.57,00:05:16.57,"merging, we don't know the condition of Kucha's member"
87,00:05:19.17,00:05:19.17,who's been in an accident. We don't know very much at all.
88,00:05:27.50,00:05:27.50,">> AMBER: ""Boys night out."" >> COLBY: Well?"
89,00:05:31.23,00:05:31.23,">> AMBER: It's different. >> AMBER: ""You've wondered for"
90,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,"weeks 'What's their camp like?' So, here's your big chance."
91,00:05:37.60,00:05:37.60,Send your scouts for the hike. The men will visit while the
92,00:05:40.53,00:05:40.53,"women remain. Cook a big dinner,"

96,00:05:48.37,00:05:48.37,guys. >> COLBY: Cool.
97,00:05:50.87,00:05:50.87,"So, we get to go on a hike. >> KEITH: I'm all over that."
98,00:05:53.47,00:05:53.47,>> COLBY: Yeah! Finally get out and do
99,00:05:55.13,00:05:55.13,something. I better iron a shirt!
100,00:05:57.93,00:05:57.93,"( laughing ) Big night out on the town,"
101,00:06:00.13,00:06:00.13,"brother. >> KEITH: Big night, you know?"
102,00:06:02.73,00:06:02.73,( indistinct conversations ) Life is good.
103,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,>> COLBY: Life is good. >> KEITH: The merge is when the
104,00:06:09.23,00:06:09.23,"two teams come together to make one team, and the game becomes"
105,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,one against one instead of team against team.
106,00:06:15.60,00:06:15.60,">> COLBY: Tina, you going to catch the kids some fish"
107,00:06:16.97,00:06:16.97,tonight? >> TINA: I hope.
108,00:06:19.60,00:06:19.60,"You go to one camp or the other, and I'm not sure how that"
109,00:06:22.50,00:06:22.50,decision is going to be made at this point.
110,00:06:25.70,00:06:25.70,">> KEITH: We'll get a real great take on the guys in their tribe,"
111,00:06:27.63,00:06:27.63,and where things lie. >> TINA: It's important for us
112,00:06:31.47,00:06:31.47,to get information right now about who's had votes cast
113,00:06:35.23,00:06:35.23,"against them, because it's probably going to come down to a"
114,00:06:37.90,00:06:37.90,tie-breaker vote. >> COLBY: We've got to be
115,00:06:40.57,00:06:40.57,totally silent on who's had any votes.
116,00:06:43.10,00:06:43.10,">> JERRI: Yes, we do have a lot at stake."
117,00:06:44.40,00:06:44.40,"If we slip anything out regarding the voting situation,"
118,00:06:47.03,00:06:47.03,we're done. The only thing to break the tie
119,00:06:50.50,00:06:50.50,is past votes for the person who is voted for.
120,00:06:54.10,00:06:54.10,If they were to vote for myself or Keith... we'd be out.
121,00:07:14.73,00:07:14.73,">> ELISABETH: Hey, fellas, are you guys ready to hear this?"
122,00:07:16.70,00:07:16.70,"We got mail. ""Girls' night out."

130,00:07:39.63,00:07:39.63,"send their chicks here? >> ALICIA: Oh, that's sneaky."
131,00:07:42.30,00:07:42.30,>> ELISABETH: That is very sneaky.
132,00:07:43.50,00:07:43.50,>> ALICIA: That is very sneaky. This is how it's going to
133,00:07:45.70,00:07:45.70,start-- separate the boys and the girls.
134,00:07:48.97,00:07:48.97,>> JEFF V.: We knew that the merger was going to start today.
135,00:07:51.33,00:07:51.33,We just weren't sure exactly how.
136,00:07:53.33,00:07:53.33,"So, we got this note, and our girls are going to them, and"

138,00:07:59.40,00:07:59.40,swooning them and somehow convincing them that this is the
139,00:08:02.93,00:08:02.93,place to live-- Kucha beach. >> ALICIA: We know we don't want
140,00:08:05.77,00:08:05.77,"to go over there, so they better really pull out all the stops."

143,00:08:12.27,00:08:12.27,strange. And it would kind of be our home

145,00:08:19.23,00:08:19.23,"for the dinner, then those girls are eating much better than"

152,00:08:34.37,00:08:34.37,guys turned on us? >> ELISABETH: We have to bring a
153,00:08:36.00,00:08:36.00,housewarming gift. >> NICK: We're not turning on
154,00:08:37.23,00:08:37.23,you. >> JEFF V.: Nobody's turning on

163,00:08:54.90,00:08:54.90,"join in our last chicken, we know that it's for the"
164,00:08:58.27,00:08:58.27,betterment of the whole group to leave and go eat plain rice with
165,00:09:03.30,00:09:03.30,Keith and Colby. He's supposedly a chef.
166,00:09:09.03,00:09:09.03,"I don't know how much he can do with white rice, and..."
167,00:09:12.63,00:09:12.63,We're going to miss our Kucha spices.

171,00:09:23.93,00:09:23.93,>> ALICIA: Elisabeth and I felt really strange walking away from
172,00:09:26.47,00:09:26.47,"camp, just us two. It was really kind of cool,"
173,00:09:30.30,00:09:30.30,and eventually it's going to change this game.

176,00:09:46.17,00:09:46.17,how they've been living the last 19 days.
177,00:09:48.87,00:09:48.87,"With their shelter, with their eating, you know, there's a lot"
178,00:09:51.03,00:09:51.03,of things I want to know to see if that's where we want to be.
179,00:09:55.23,00:09:55.23,>> ELISABETH: I'm excited. I'm so curious to see what their
180,00:09:57.57,00:09:57.57,"camp is like. >> ALICIA: Well, that's the"
181,00:09:59.10,00:09:59.10,thing... And how they set it up for us.

185,00:10:16.83,00:10:16.83,You know how funny it is-- the guys are expecting you guys
186,00:10:19.77,00:10:19.77,right now. ( laughter )
187,00:10:23.07,00:10:23.07,>> ALICIA: We had... laying out the tablecloth.
188,00:10:25.53,00:10:25.53,">> It said ""Boys Night Out."" >> ALICIA: They're so ready."
189,00:10:28.93,00:10:28.93,They're going to die when they see your guys.
190,00:10:31.20,00:10:31.20,>> TINA: We've been so worried. >> ELISABETH: They didn't even
191,00:10:34.00,00:10:34.00,"tell you guys what happened? >> TINA: No, not a word."
192,00:10:35.83,00:10:35.83,>> ALICIA: What did your note say?
193,00:10:36.80,00:10:36.80,>> AMBER: Somebody got hurt and they would not be returning.
194,00:10:38.37,00:10:38.37,>> TINA: And they've been evacuated out.
195,00:10:40.27,00:10:40.27,>> ELISABETH: Sit down for this one.
196,00:10:41.57,00:10:41.57,">> ALICIA: Yeah, this is a, it's a big deal."
197,00:10:43.53,00:10:43.53,>> ELISABETH: It was good to hear that they were worried and
198,00:10:46.20,00:10:46.20,hoping everything and praying everything was okay with Mike.
199,00:10:48.93,00:10:48.93,He apparently just hyperventilated and passed out.
200,00:10:52.13,00:10:52.13,"And all of a sudden, I see him down and he was face-first into"
201,00:10:56.50,00:10:56.50,the fire. >> ALICIA: His hands were burned
202,00:10:58.10,00:10:58.10,off. When his hands were in the
203,00:11:00.10,00:11:00.10,"water, the skin was floating up above his hand."
204,00:11:01.93,00:11:01.93,>> ELISABETH: They were just red.
205,00:11:02.93,00:11:02.93,>> ALICIA: They put a helicopter right on our beach and took him
206,00:11:04.30,00:11:04.30,away. >> TINA: Have you heard any news
207,00:11:06.27,00:11:06.27,"on him at all? >> ALICIA: Yeah, he's going to"
208,00:11:07.37,00:11:07.37,be okay. >> TINA: Glad to know it's not
209,00:11:11.40,00:11:11.40,one of those things that's life- threatening.
210,00:11:13.10,00:11:13.10,"I felt a lot of relief. >> ALICIA: We were crying, we"
211,00:11:15.47,00:11:15.47,were a mess. It was really sad.
212,00:11:17.67,00:11:17.67,>> ELISABETH: It was very difficult.
213,00:11:19.63,00:11:19.63,>> JERRI: When we first found out yesterday that we were
214,00:11:21.23,00:11:21.23,"merging with all five of us, after the accident over at"
215,00:11:25.00,00:11:25.00,Kucha... we didn't really know whether to celebrate or feel
216,00:11:29.13,00:11:29.13,bad. >> ALICIA: Whatever takes you
217,00:11:33.60,00:11:33.60,out of the game takes you out of the game.
218,00:11:35.40,00:11:35.40,"Whether it's a snake bite or the fire, it was part of the game."
219,00:11:38.73,00:11:38.73,And he is the sixth person to leave.
220,00:11:42.00,00:11:42.00,">> TINA: The importance at this point in at five and five, had a"
221,00:11:44.47,00:11:44.47,"huge impact on the other four tribes, if we had gone in at six"
222,00:11:48.13,00:11:48.13,"and four, we would have been picked off one by one, no doubt"
223,00:11:50.57,00:11:50.57,about it. We're starting off the second
224,00:11:53.77,00:11:53.77,half of the game on equal ground.
225,00:11:56.03,00:11:56.03,"It's a tie ball game, we're going into overtime."
226,00:12:09.40,00:12:09.40,>> COLBY: We got to be getting close. Look at this.
227,00:12:11.93,00:12:11.93,Anybody home? >> KEITH: Knock-knock.
228,00:12:14.37,00:12:14.37,Hola. >> JEFF V.: What?
229,00:12:16.90,00:12:16.90,Wait a minute! >> COLBY: What are you guys
230,00:12:19.37,00:12:19.37,"doing? Well, we took a little trip down"
231,00:12:21.10,00:12:21.10,"the beach. >> KEITH: Hi, man!"
232,00:12:23.93,00:12:23.93,">> NICK: Good to see you. >> JEFF V.: So, your note said"
233,00:12:28.70,00:12:28.70,"what, ""Boys Night Out""? >> COLBY: ""Boys Night Out."""
234,00:12:31.13,00:12:31.13,">> JEFF V.: Ours said ""Girls Night Out."""
235,00:12:33.40,00:12:33.40,>> RODGER: We were expecting the women over here.
236,00:12:35.50,00:12:35.50,">> COLBY: Rodger, I'm real sorry, bro."
237,00:12:37.77,00:12:37.77,"I didn't even bring a skirt with me, so I can't do anything for"
238,00:12:39.57,00:12:39.57,"you, man. >> COLBY: When Keith and I"
239,00:12:43.10,00:12:43.10,"showed up, they couldn't have been more disappointed."
240,00:12:45.53,00:12:45.53,"They were ready to wine and dine the women of Ogakor, and Keith"
241,00:12:49.80,00:12:49.80,"and I come strolling in. Look, you guys already had the"
242,00:12:52.57,00:12:52.57,table set and everything. Y'all really were expecting
243,00:12:53.80,00:12:53.80,the... ( all talking and laughing )
244,00:12:57.20,00:12:57.20,>> KEITH: Colby and I were actually kind of hoping it was
245,00:13:00.73,00:13:00.73,going to be the girls cooking for the guys.
246,00:13:02.60,00:13:02.60,"We had a good time, great camaraderie, kind of like"
247,00:13:04.73,00:13:04.73,soldiers in the field that are putting their weapons down for
248,00:13:06.30,00:13:06.30,"awhile. >> COLBY: Well, now, you guys"
249,00:13:08.53,00:13:08.53,"called this Camp Carnage, but it looks like you guys are living"
250,00:13:10.47,00:13:10.47,"pretty plush around here. Our girls, when they sent us"
251,00:13:13.07,00:13:13.07,"off, they're like, ""Man, check out their camp-- if it's"
252,00:13:16.23,00:13:16.23,"smelling and there's flies, I don't want to move over there."""
253,00:13:18.73,00:13:18.73,( laughter ) >> JEFF V.: All I saw from Colby
254,00:13:21.93,00:13:21.93,"were teeth-- big smile, how's it going, whatever."
255,00:13:25.33,00:13:25.33,"He just seemed very cheery and very happy, and Keith seemed"
256,00:13:27.77,00:13:27.77,like a little puppy tailing behind him.
257,00:13:29.83,00:13:29.83,We saved a chicken for you. >> KEITH: Are you serious?
258,00:13:32.87,00:13:32.87,">> RODGER: Yeah, we're going to have chicken tonight."
259,00:13:34.90,00:13:34.90,">> KEITH: You guys are too much. >> JEFF V.: We got spices, too."
260,00:13:37.67,00:13:37.67,>> KEITH: We can roast it in paper bark.
261,00:13:39.67,00:13:39.67,"Wrap that whole thing in there, put the spices on and slow roast"
262,00:13:40.77,00:13:40.77,that. They saved a chicken for us.
263,00:13:44.07,00:13:44.07,"They killed their last chicken and cooked it, which just was a"
264,00:13:46.17,00:13:46.17,real gentleman thing to do for us.
265,00:13:49.97,00:13:49.97,">> JEFF V.: You know, there's a Survivor twist to everything,"
266,00:13:51.73,00:13:51.73,"and they got us again. I was expecting women, you know."
267,00:13:54.93,00:13:54.93,"We were going to lather them up and go pick them flowers, and"
268,00:13:57.60,00:13:57.60,now we're going to have to shift gears.
269,00:14:00.70,00:14:00.70,"( laughing ) They're nice, you know?"
270,00:14:03.03,00:14:03.03,"They're nice guys. I knew they would be, but I get"
271,00:14:05.20,00:14:05.20,the feeling that Keith is an outsider.
272,00:14:08.97,00:14:08.97,"So far, they're exactly what I expected."
273,00:14:09.90,00:14:09.90,"They seem to have a good relationship together, which I"
274,00:14:13.57,00:14:13.57,didn't expect. I figured that Keith would sort
275,00:14:17.90,00:14:17.90,"of be off on his own, and he could be, you know?"
276,00:14:20.53,00:14:20.53,"They may be working us here. Just pick one up, take a bite,"
277,00:14:23.87,00:14:23.87,pass it. >> COLBY: I didn't think I'd see
278,00:14:26.87,00:14:26.87,chicken across these lips for 24 days.
279,00:14:29.20,00:14:29.20,"That lemon pepper is the bomb. >> JEFF V.: It was good chicken,"
280,00:14:32.83,00:14:32.83,"and it was good to be able to provide them with chicken,"
281,00:14:34.53,00:14:34.53,'cause they obviously had not been eating.
282,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,">> KEITH: Colby, what do you want me to do with this bone,"
283,00:14:38.30,00:14:38.30,man? I don't like the way we're
284,00:14:40.37,00:14:40.37,passing. Can we change the passing
285,00:14:42.03,00:14:42.03,around? Can we go the other way?
286,00:14:44.17,00:14:44.17,That was a huge thing for us. We really enjoyed that a lot.
287,00:14:48.63,00:14:48.63,"I think as the days go on, this game is going to be difficult."
288,00:14:51.63,00:14:51.63,"It is for me personally, 'cause I get caught up in the"
289,00:14:53.60,00:14:53.60,friendship thing quite easily. >> RODGER: Even though it was
290,00:14:56.27,00:14:56.27,"little tough, that was still a good chicken."
291,00:14:57.43,00:14:57.43,>> KEITH: Yeah. >> COLBY: It was an excellent
292,00:14:58.87,00:14:58.87,chicken. >> RODGER: I know everybody is
293,00:15:02.30,00:15:02.30,"nicey-nicey now, but I imagine that'll change."
294,00:15:04.03,00:15:04.03,"I think it will be even more interesting once all ten of us,"
295,00:15:06.33,00:15:06.33,the women and everybody is in the hut.
296,00:15:07.97,00:15:07.97,There'll be some times I'm sure when things won't be so nice
297,00:15:09.77,00:15:09.77,around here. >> ELISABETH: You need some
298,00:15:20.73,00:15:20.73,help? >> JERRI: I think I'll be all
299,00:15:22.77,00:15:22.77,"right. I'm just trying to cover this,"
300,00:15:24.50,00:15:24.50,'cause you know what I just realized?
301,00:15:26.63,00:15:26.63,Our only matches are in Keith's pocket.
302,00:15:28.87,00:15:28.87,">> ALICIA: Uh-oh. >> JERRI: Yeah, ""uh-oh"" is"
303,00:15:31.10,00:15:31.10,"right. So, I'm thinking we should"
304,00:15:33.73,00:15:33.73,probably cook everything because Keith has the matches.
305,00:15:37.43,00:15:37.43,>> ALICIA: Are you sure he has them?
306,00:15:38.33,00:15:38.33,>> JERRI: I know he does. >> ALICIA: He's probably
307,00:15:41.27,00:15:41.27,"laughing right now, going ""Guess what?"
308,00:15:42.40,00:15:42.40,"It's raining and I got the matches."""
309,00:15:44.33,00:15:44.33,">> JERRI: He doesn't realize it, I'm sure."
310,00:15:46.47,00:15:46.47,I don't want to talk about Keith in front of our guests.
311,00:15:51.67,00:15:51.67,>> ALICIA: Smell that. >> JERRI: If I voice my opinions
312,00:15:53.97,00:15:53.97,"about how I really feel about him, they are going to figure"
313,00:15:56.20,00:15:56.20,out that votes have been placed against him.
314,00:15:59.70,00:15:59.70,He should not be in charge of the matches.
315,00:16:02.47,00:16:02.47,Could have potentially now been an issue where we couldn't eat.
316,00:16:07.17,00:16:07.17,">> TINA: I don't think it was a deliberate thing where he said,"
317,00:16:09.70,00:16:09.70,"""I'm going to take my matches with me so the girls won't have"
318,00:16:10.77,00:16:10.77,"it."" He would not do that under any"
319,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,circumstances. It's in Jerri's best interest to
320,00:16:16.90,00:16:16.90,not to show a real hateful side. Jerri's a good chick.
321,00:16:23.27,00:16:23.27,>> JERRI: Normally it looks a lots better than it is right
322,00:16:24.30,00:16:24.30,now. >> ELISABETH: We're going home.
323,00:16:26.50,00:16:26.50,( laughter ) >> JERRI: We decided that I was
324,00:16:29.83,00:16:29.83,"going to make my famous tortilla, and we opened a can of"
325,00:16:35.17,00:16:35.17,whole peeled tomatoes. >> ALICIA: We just want to tell
326,00:16:37.77,00:16:37.77,you guys that your guys are getting chicken right now.
327,00:16:39.37,00:16:39.37,>> AMBER: Oh! There's no way they saved any
328,00:16:41.87,00:16:41.87,for us. >> ALICIA: They're getting
329,00:16:43.93,00:16:43.93,chicken right now. >> AMBER: I'm sorry we don't
330,00:16:45.63,00:16:45.63,have any chicken. >> ALICIA: That's okay.
331,00:16:48.43,00:16:48.43,>> AMBER: This is definitely difficult for us.
332,00:16:49.97,00:16:49.97,"I mean, we wish we had so much more to offer them."
333,00:16:52.20,00:16:52.20,It's upsetting that we can't give them as much as they can
334,00:16:53.67,00:16:53.67,"give us. >> ALICIA: Wow, that looks"
335,00:16:55.73,00:16:55.73,"amazing, though. >> JERRI: Give me, like, some"
336,00:16:57.80,00:16:57.80,ingredients that I can get creative with.
337,00:17:00.30,00:17:00.30,>> ALICIA: When you don't have a lot of food and you open up a
338,00:17:02.17,00:17:02.17,"can, that's like... that's big- time."
339,00:17:03.87,00:17:03.87,"So, we're really honored that they did that."
340,00:17:05.50,00:17:05.50,">> AMBER: Watch it, it's hot. >> ALICIA: I feel like I can't"
341,00:17:08.30,00:17:08.30,wait to get them back to our camp to give them something to
342,00:17:11.40,00:17:11.40,"eat, you know? And I never thought that I would"
343,00:17:13.53,00:17:13.53,feel that way. I really thought I would be
344,00:17:15.47,00:17:15.47,thinking I'm not sharing anything with them.
345,00:17:22.20,00:17:22.20,"I don't eat meat, I don't eat pork, and I'm, like, craving a"
346,00:17:25.33,00:17:25.33,hot dog and a hamburger; I could care less right now.
347,00:17:27.93,00:17:27.93,>> JERRI: I would love a hot dog.
348,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,( laughing ) >> ALICIA: Out of 20 hours of
349,00:17:32.13,00:17:32.13,"being here, we've talked about food 19 of those 20."
350,00:17:35.97,00:17:35.97,"So, what's your favorite kind of food?"
351,00:17:37.00,00:17:37.00,>> JERRI: Hot fudge. >> TINA: How about Dove
352,00:17:38.47,00:17:38.47,chocolate? ( everyone groaning )
353,00:17:41.90,00:17:41.90,>> ELISABETH: We're torturing ourselves.
354,00:17:43.07,00:17:43.07,We are absolutely torturing ourselves.
355,00:17:45.47,00:17:45.47,">> ALICIA: Have you ever had different flavor Tootsie Rolls,"
356,00:17:47.40,00:17:47.40,like cherry Tootsie Rolls? >> TINA: Yes.
357,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,>> JERRI: Vanilla? >> ALICIA: They are yummy.
358,00:17:53.10,00:17:53.10,>> JERRI: When did they come out with vanilla Tootsie Rolls?
359,00:18:03.47,00:18:03.47,>> AMBER: I asked Alicia about their firewood situation.
360,00:18:06.00,00:18:06.00,"She said they have so, so much, they don't worry about the"
361,00:18:08.47,00:18:08.47,"firewood at all. >> JERRI: They have a kitchen,"
362,00:18:10.63,00:18:10.63,they have all these wonderful things.
363,00:18:12.90,00:18:12.90,We have nothing. >> AMBER: I agree.
364,00:18:16.40,00:18:16.40,I'm totally for going. >> JERRI: I'm so stoked about
365,00:18:18.73,00:18:18.73,going to their camp. >> TINA: We've got mail!
366,00:18:22.57,00:18:22.57,>> JERRI: Is there chocolate in it?
367,00:18:24.03,00:18:24.03,">> TINA: No, ma'am. >> ELISABETH: Peanut butter in"

573,00:28:33.20,00:28:33.20,>> RODGER: It ain't very good. Stick it out.
574,00:28:36.23,00:28:36.23,>> COLBY: That one bite of peanut butter was better than

595,00:30:14.07,00:30:14.07,Maybe those are the four people that feel the most vulnerable.
596,00:30:16.20,00:30:16.20,"I felt vulnerable, but, you know, I couldn't do it."
597,00:30:18.37,00:30:18.37,I knew I couldn't do it. >> RODGER: Tina out there-- she
598,00:30:23.83,00:30:23.83,has not had anything to eat all day long.
599,00:30:26.03,00:30:26.03,"She-She didn't eat any breakfast this morning, and the rest of us"
600,00:30:28.57,00:30:28.57,all had about a little bit over a half a cup of rice.
601,00:30:31.40,00:30:31.40,"And I know they're getting cold, too."
602,00:30:34.27,00:30:34.27,>> COLBY: These four are pretty damn determined.
603,00:30:36.27,00:30:36.27,I've never seen anything like it.
604,00:30:38.10,00:30:38.10,I had no idea it would last this long.
605,00:30:39.57,00:30:39.57,There's no telling how long those four are gonna stay out
606,00:30:41.50,00:30:41.50,there. Another fun day for Club

610,00:30:55.53,00:30:55.53,>> ELISABETH: Is there any more negotiating?
611,00:30:57.90,00:30:57.90,>> JEFF: Maybe. What makes you want to negotiate
612,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,"now, but you didn't earlier? >> ELISABETH: A boat ride"
613,00:31:14.20,00:31:14.20,back... could be worth it. >> How long you think they're
614,00:31:29.07,00:31:29.07,going to stay out there? >> JEFF V.: I heard Tina say
615,00:31:30.80,00:31:30.80,"""Nothing is bringing me down at this point."""
616,00:31:32.67,00:31:32.67,"I bet Elisabeth goes next. >> JEFF: Stay dry, I'll get you"

626,00:32:17.93,00:32:17.93,so I think she's going to stay. These people are crazy.

628,00:32:28.63,00:32:28.63,">> Hey, Jeff. >> JEFF: Your faces say a lot."
629,00:32:34.00,00:32:34.00,"Here's what I have. Hot coffee, or hot chocolate."

631,00:32:44.87,00:32:44.87,>> ALICIA: I'll take it. I'm done.

633,00:32:51.03,00:32:51.03,>> TINA: What? >> KEITH: I need this one.
634,00:32:53.90,00:32:53.90,">> TINA: I looked over at Keith and Keith said ""Tina, I need"
635,00:32:56.40,00:32:56.40,"this one."" In his heart he must have really"
636,00:32:59.97,00:32:59.97,thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him.
637,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,>> ALICIA: I'm good. I want coffee!
638,00:33:05.00,00:33:05.00,( indistinct conversation ) >> ALICIA: Are you coming with

640,00:33:09.73,00:33:09.73,">> ALICIA: Oh, Tina is getting down."
641,00:33:12.60,00:33:12.60,>> TINA: It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in.
642,00:33:16.23,00:33:16.23,"Much harder to come in than stay out there, because I've been out"
643,00:33:19.03,00:33:19.03,there ten hours. I knew for our team that I
644,00:33:22.83,00:33:22.83,needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him
645,00:33:25.70,00:33:25.70,have it. >> KEITH: Yes!
646,00:33:29.63,00:33:29.63,">> Good work, Keith. >> JEFF: Wear that."
647,00:34:01.77,00:34:01.77,>> JEFF: What a day! >> ALICIA: What a day.
648,00:34:05.83,00:34:05.83,>> JEFF: You guys just finished a marathon immunity challenge.

650,00:34:10.97,00:34:10.97,vote the first person out of your new tribe.
651,00:34:13.23,00:34:13.23,Let's talk about today's challenge.
652,00:34:15.87,00:34:15.87,"Nick lasted 90 minutes. Now, at the other end of the"
653,00:34:19.23,00:34:19.23,"spectrum, Keith lasted ten hours, 18 minutes."

655,00:34:29.33,00:34:29.33,"minutes, 55 seconds. Alicia, I'm thinking you"
656,00:34:33.93,00:34:33.93,"obviously must not be worried, because you were out there for a"
657,00:34:36.50,00:34:36.50,"long time and finally said ""Okay, I guess I've proved my"

659,00:34:41.63,00:34:41.63,like it was going to go on forever.
660,00:34:44.30,00:34:44.30,And I don't think that my stepping off is going to change
661,00:34:48.70,00:34:48.70,what was going to happen tonight anyways.
662,00:34:51.87,00:34:51.87,">> JEFF: Keith, when I came up to you and handed you the"

664,00:34:57.27,00:34:57.27,"said ""Tina gave that to me."" >> KEITH: I really firmly"
665,00:35:00.17,00:35:00.17,"believe that if she did not say, ""Okay, I'm done now,"" we'd all"
666,00:35:06.23,00:35:06.23,"still be there, we really would. She's become like my sister, I'm"
667,00:35:11.43,00:35:11.43,"telling you, and it was definitely a gift."
668,00:35:15.17,00:35:15.17,">> JEFF: What was it, Tina, that finally made you say, okay?"
669,00:35:19.10,00:35:19.10,">> TINA: At this point, I'm still a team player."
670,00:35:21.77,00:35:21.77,Our team advancing does mean a lot.
671,00:35:24.37,00:35:24.37,I know Keith needed this. So... it's all right.
672,00:35:31.00,00:35:31.00,">> JEFF: Rodger, when you look at what happened today and how"
673,00:35:32.87,00:35:32.87,"many people took a bribe sooner or later and jumped off, do"
674,00:35:36.57,00:35:36.57,you think everybody here is really worried?
675,00:35:39.30,00:35:39.30,">> RODGER: Well, everybody but Keith I would say, Keith is"
676,00:35:41.20,00:35:41.20,"definitely not worried, but yes I think anyone of the other nine"
677,00:35:44.73,00:35:44.73,"of us are, has a very good possibility of being voted off."
678,00:35:49.20,00:35:49.20,">> JEFF: Here's the deal. Survive tonight's vote, you"
679,00:35:52.50,00:35:52.50,are here till the bitter end. You'll be part of the jury at
680,00:35:55.17,00:35:55.17,"the very least, you may be the final two."
681,00:35:57.83,00:35:57.83,"If you're voted out tonight, game is over."
682,00:36:01.10,00:36:01.10,"You go home, and that's it. Let's vote."

700,00:38:52.90,00:38:52.90,"Okay. In the case of a tie, here's how"
701,00:38:55.67,00:38:55.67,"it works. Jeff, Colby, you will not vote."
702,00:38:59.60,00:38:59.60,The other eight of you will vote.

715,00:39:37.23,00:39:37.23,"is, we're going to vote again. Nick, you're up first, if you"
