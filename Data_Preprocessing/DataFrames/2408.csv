441,00:13:51.00,00:13:51.00,IT WOULD PISS ME OFF TO SEE
442,00:13:54.63,00:13:54.63,SOMEBODY LIKE MIKE UP THERE.
443,00:13:55.57,00:13:55.57,"ME, TOO, IT HAS TO BE ALL"

459,00:14:33.70,00:14:33.70,MAKES SENSE IS TO TAKE OUT MIKE.

466,00:14:45.77,00:14:45.77,BUT IF ALL SIX GIRLS VOTE

468,00:14:48.73,00:14:48.73,WE CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE GAME.

519,00:16:34.13,00:16:34.13,SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT
520,00:16:36.67,00:16:36.67,"SABRINA, KIM, AND CHELSEA, WANT"
521,00:16:38.33,00:16:38.33,TO STICK WITH THE SALANI GROUP

531,00:17:06.53,00:17:06.53,THIS IS MISERABLE.
532,00:17:08.47,00:17:08.47,"LAST NIGHT, IT WAS RAINING AND"
533,00:17:10.53,00:17:10.53,WINDY AND THE WALL GOT BLOWN OFF
534,00:17:12.73,00:17:12.73,OUR SHELTER.
535,00:17:13.73,00:17:13.73,EVERYTHING'S WET.
536,00:17:14.50,00:17:14.50,IT'S JUST A BIG TRAIN WRECK.

541,00:17:27.53,00:17:27.53,THE WALL.
542,00:17:28.17,00:17:28.17,WE NEED EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.
543,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,THAT WAS HANGING THERE
544,00:17:30.27,00:17:30.27,CONNECTED TO NOTHING.
545,00:17:31.27,00:17:31.27,I HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY INTRINSIC
546,00:17:32.83,00:17:32.83,"PARTS OF THIS WALL OFF, OKAY,"
547,00:17:36.57,00:17:36.57,GUYS?
548,00:17:36.87,00:17:36.87,IT SURE LOOKED THAT WAY.
549,00:17:38.43,00:17:38.43,LIKE THE MOST EDUCATE PEOPLE
550,00:17:40.73,00:17:40.73,HAVE NO COMMON SENSE.
551,00:17:41.50,00:17:41.50,I KNOW.
552,00:17:44.63,00:17:44.63,THE WIND HAS NEVER BEEN THIS
553,00:17:47.17,00:17:47.17,"BAD, AND TARZAN TOOK OFF PART OF"
554,00:17:50.07,00:17:50.07,OUR BAMBOO WALL TO CUT FOR
555,00:17:53.20,00:17:53.20,FIREWOOD.
556,00:17:53.60,00:17:53.60,WHEN THERE'S A WHOLE STACK OF
557,00:17:55.90,00:17:55.90,FIREWOOD FOR THE FIRE.
558,00:18:00.30,00:18:00.30,BECAUSE SOMEBODY CUT IT AND
559,00:18:02.23,00:18:02.23,"LAID IT THERE, OKAY?"
560,00:18:04.50,00:18:04.50,I'M NOT THAT STUPID.
561,00:18:05.20,00:18:05.20,IT'S NOT PART OF THE WALL.
562,00:18:07.83,00:18:07.83,OKAY?
563,00:18:09.10,00:18:09.10,"CHELSEA, YOU STILL THINKING IT'S"
564,00:18:10.20,00:18:10.20,PART OF THE WALL AND I STOLE A
565,00:18:11.30,00:18:11.30,PIECE OF WALL?
566,00:18:11.97,00:18:11.97,I'M OVER IT.
567,00:18:13.17,00:18:13.17,YOU'VE ALREADY CUT IT UP SO IT'S NO--
568,00:18:14.73,00:18:14.73,YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ATTITUDE
569,00:18:17.40,00:18:17.40,WHEN IT'S JUST HANGING THERE.
570,00:18:19.20,00:18:19.20,I DON'T MIND BEING ACCUSED OF
571,00:18:20.97,00:18:20.97,STUFF WHEN I'M WRONG BUT I DON'T
572,00:18:21.00,00:18:21.00,LIKE BEING ACCUSED OF STUFF WHEN
573,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,I'M RIGHT.
574,00:18:22.53,00:18:22.53,I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT
575,00:18:24.80,00:18:24.80,ANYMORE.
576,00:18:25.03,00:18:25.03,"WELL, GOOD."
577,00:18:28.13,00:18:28.13,WHEN YOU'RE AROUND SOMEBODY YOU
578,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,SENSE WHETHER YOU'RE AN IRRITANT
579,00:18:30.90,00:18:30.90,TO THEM AND IT SEEMS CHELSEA'S
580,00:18:32.43,00:18:32.43,BEEN SORT OF SUBLIMINALLY
581,00:18:35.10,00:18:35.10,HARASSING ME.
582,00:18:37.97,00:18:37.97,IT WAS AN ACCUSIZATION.
583,00:18:40.53,00:18:40.53,YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
584,00:18:41.27,00:18:41.27,JUST LET IT GO.
585,00:18:42.53,00:18:42.53,AND I'M JUST A PERSON IF I
586,00:18:44.50,00:18:44.50,BELIEVE I'VE BEEN UNFAIRLY
587,00:18:47.03,00:18:47.03,"MALIGNED, I CAN'T JUST TAKE IT."
588,00:18:48.57,00:18:48.57,I HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING.
589,00:18:50.37,00:18:50.37,AND I THINK I KNOW WHY SHE'S
590,00:18:52.23,00:18:52.23,BEEN UNHAPPY WITH ME.
591,00:18:53.13,00:18:53.13,I SENSE AN AGGRAVATION WITH
592,00:18:55.03,00:18:55.03,ME.
593,00:18:55.50,00:18:55.50,AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
594,00:18:56.73,00:18:56.73,YOU YOU'VE HAD SURGERY AND I'M A
595,00:18:59.27,00:18:59.27,PLASTIC SURGEON AND YOU DON'T
596,00:19:00.33,00:19:00.33,LIKE YOUR PLASTIC SURGEON OR
597,00:19:01.70,00:19:01.70,"SOMETHING, BUT YOU-- YOU'VE BEEN"
598,00:19:03.57,00:19:03.57,NEGATIVE TOWARDS ME SINCE I'VE
599,00:19:04.93,00:19:04.93,COME IN CONTACT WITH YOU.
600,00:19:06.87,00:19:06.87,TARZAN TOOK ME OFF TO THE
601,00:19:08.73,00:19:08.73,SIDE AND ASKED ME IF I DIDN'T
602,00:19:11.03,00:19:11.03,LIKE HIM BECAUSE I HAD A BAD
603,00:19:13.90,00:19:13.90,EXPERIENCE WITH MY PLASTIC
604,00:19:16.10,00:19:16.10,SURGEON.
605,00:19:16.53,00:19:16.53,"I MEAN, IS THIS GUY FOR REAL?"
606,00:19:19.07,00:19:19.07,I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S TALKING
607,00:19:21.47,00:19:21.47,ABOUT MY BOOK JOB.
608,00:19:22.57,00:19:22.57,HE'S JUST-- HE'S CRAZY.
609,00:19:24.30,00:19:24.30,ARE YOU SURE THERE ISN'T A
610,00:19:27.03,00:19:27.03,DEEP-SEATED THING BECAUSE THERE
611,00:19:27.63,00:19:27.63,ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD PLASTIC
612,00:19:29.37,00:19:29.37,SURGERY AND THEY HATE THEIR
613,00:19:31.10,00:19:31.10,SURGEON.
614,00:19:31.47,00:19:31.47,"NO, THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO"
615,00:19:33.07,00:19:33.07,WITH ANYTHING.
616,00:19:33.60,00:19:33.60,IT WAS JUST SO ANNOYING.
617,00:19:34.70,00:19:34.70,"TO ME, IT'S, LIKE, GET TARZAN"
618,00:19:37.10,00:19:37.10,OUT AS FASTS POSSIBLE.
619,00:19:38.50,00:19:38.50,BUT IT'S A GAME WHERE YOU HAVE
620,00:19:39.57,00:19:39.57,TO THINK WITH YOUR HEAD.
621,00:19:42.40,00:19:42.40,( THUNDER )
622,00:19:44.70,00:19:44.70,IF YOU GET THAT ROPE OVER
623,00:19:47.23,00:19:47.23,"HERE, I CAN PULL IT!"
624,00:19:49.77,00:19:49.77,"LEIF, DAMN IT, GIVE ME THE ROPE!"
625,00:19:51.57,00:19:51.57,AS MUCH AS I CAN'T STAND
626,00:19:53.80,00:19:53.80,"TARZAN, I THINK AT THIS POINT"
627,00:19:55.23,00:19:55.23,IT'S ALL ABOUT TAKING STRONGER
628,00:19:56.60,00:19:56.60,PEOPLE OUT WHO COULD POSSIBLY BE
629,00:19:57.97,00:19:57.97,A THREAT.
630,00:19:59.13,00:19:59.13,AND TARZAN'S NOT A THREAT AT
631,00:20:02.00,00:20:02.00,ALL.
632,00:20:02.43,00:20:02.43,SO I HATE TO SAY IT BUT I'M
633,00:20:04.40,00:20:04.40,THINKING THAT HE NEEDS TO STICK
634,00:20:05.77,00:20:05.77,AROUND A LITTLE LONGER.
635,00:20:12.10,00:20:12.10,TROY?
636,00:20:12.93,00:20:12.93,I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
637,00:20:14.23,00:20:14.23,THAT MIKE IS SUBTLY PLANTING THE
638,00:20:16.67,00:20:16.67,SEED IN LOTS OF PEOPLE'S MINDS
639,00:20:18.63,00:20:18.63,THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WIN AND
640,00:20:19.73,00:20:19.73,"THAT, LIKE, WE CAN'T LET YOU"
641,00:20:21.23,00:20:21.23,"MAKE IT THAT LONG, AND SO I JUST"
642,00:20:23.70,00:20:23.70,FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT TO GET MIKE
643,00:20:25.07,00:20:25.07,OUT OF HERE BECAUSE HE'S ONE OF
644,00:20:26.33,00:20:26.33,THE ONLY PEOPLE I THINK THAT
645,00:20:28.03,00:20:28.03,COULD PULL IN CHRISTINA AND
646,00:20:30.00,00:20:30.00,ALICIA AND GETS ONE MORE OF US
647,00:20:31.70,00:20:31.70,TO VOTE AND YOU'RE GOING HOME
648,00:20:33.03,00:20:33.03,AND THEN WE'RE ALL GOING HOME.

925,00:30:27.30,00:30:27.30,NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.
926,00:30:29.93,00:30:29.93,THAT'S REAL PROMISING.
927,00:30:36.77,00:30:36.77,ANYBODY GOT ANY INPUT WHILE

957,00:31:28.83,00:31:28.83,ALLIANCE AND ASKED JAY TO VOTE
958,00:31:29.97,00:31:29.97,FOR MIKE.
959,00:31:30.97,00:31:30.97,THAT'S ASININE.
960,00:31:31.83,00:31:31.83,WE NEED TO KEEP TROY AND JAY
961,00:31:33.77,00:31:33.77,THINKING IT'S SALANI TO THE END.
962,00:31:35.13,00:31:35.13,AND NOW IT'S KIND OF BECOME A
963,00:31:36.90,00:31:36.90,HUGE MESS.
964,00:31:37.40,00:31:37.40,SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THIS
965,00:31:39.57,00:31:39.57,IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN.
966,00:31:40.73,00:31:40.73,WE CANNOT SEND A GIRL HOME
967,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,TONIGHT.

970,00:31:45.47,00:31:45.47,MIKE IS GOING TO ASK ME WHO
971,00:31:47.33,00:31:47.33,WE'RE VOTING FOR.
972,00:31:48.60,00:31:48.60,HOPEFULLY WE CAN BE COOL
973,00:31:50.80,00:31:50.80,ABOUT IT AND NOT GET PANICKY.
974,00:31:53.27,00:31:53.27,MIKE JUST WENT FOR A WALK.
975,00:31:55.90,00:31:55.90,HE'S GOING TO BLOW THIS CAMP UP.

979,00:32:05.23,00:32:05.23,I DON'T KNOW.
980,00:32:07.20,00:32:07.20,NOBODY'S TALKED TO ME.
981,00:32:07.83,00:32:07.83,CHECK THIS OUT.
982,00:32:08.97,00:32:08.97,"WE WERE SITTING BACK THERE,"
983,00:32:11.73,00:32:11.73,CHOMPING ON POPCORN--

985,00:32:17.73,00:32:17.73,THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT.
986,00:32:21.17,00:32:21.17,AND THEN NEXT TIME DO GUY AND
987,00:32:23.47,00:32:23.47,GIRL.
988,00:32:23.90,00:32:23.90,THEN THE MANONO TRIBE IS GONE.

990,00:32:31.50,00:32:31.50,Y'ALL BUT I'M JUST SAYING I
991,00:32:32.80,00:32:32.80,DON'T HAVE A GOOD VIBE GOING ON.
992,00:32:35.10,00:32:35.10,"JAY, YOU KNOW, HE'S REALLY"
993,00:32:36.73,00:32:36.73,"NERVOUS, BUT MY ALLIANCE IS"

1002,00:32:52.13,00:32:52.13,BUT I COULD SAY THAT NOW AND

1077,00:35:29.43,00:35:29.43,I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
1078,00:35:30.53,00:35:30.53,THINK THEY'RE PART OF AN
1079,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47,ALLIANCE AND THAT'S WHERE THE
1080,00:35:33.73,00:35:33.73,CONFUSION IS SETTING IN.
1081,00:35:35.00,00:35:35.00,WE ALL DID HAVE OUR FIRST
1082,00:35:36.80,00:35:36.80,ALLIANCES BUT THEN WE HAD TIME
1083,00:35:38.17,00:35:38.17,TO DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS
1084,00:35:39.07,00:35:39.07,WHEN WE SWITCHED TRIBES SO I
1085,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,THINK SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP
1086,00:35:42.27,00:35:42.27,YOUR OPTIONS OPEN AND KNOW WHEN
1087,00:35:43.57,00:35:43.57,"TO STICK WITH A PLAN, TOO."
1088,00:35:48.33,00:35:48.33,"Jeff: CHELSEA, THAT'S A"
1089,00:35:50.03,00:35:50.03,REALLY CAREFULLY CRAFTED ANSWER.
1090,00:35:52.33,00:35:52.33,I THINK IN A WAY YOU WANT TO
1091,00:35:54.33,00:35:54.33,BE ALIGNED WITH MORE THAN TWO
1092,00:35:56.63,00:35:56.63,"GROUPS, MAYBE YOU WANT TO BE"
1093,00:35:57.67,00:35:57.67,"ALIGNED WITH THREE GROUPS, AND"
1094,00:36:00.20,00:36:00.20,JUST SEE WHICH ONE HAS MORE
1095,00:36:01.57,00:36:01.57,TRUST AND KEEP YOURSELF WITH THE
1096,00:36:03.67,00:36:03.67,MAJORITY.
1097,00:36:04.10,00:36:04.10,SO MAYBE IT'S GOOD TO HAVE MORE
1098,00:36:06.83,00:36:06.83,OPTIONS.
1099,00:36:07.23,00:36:07.23,"Jeff: ALICIA, DOES THAT ADD"
1100,00:36:09.87,00:36:09.87,A WHOLE OTHER DIMENSION THAT YOU
1101,00:36:11.50,00:36:11.50,NOW HAVE 11 PEOPLE EXPERK
1102,00:36:12.73,00:36:12.73,BECAUSE THE LINES AREN'T REALLY
1103,00:36:14.70,00:36:14.70,"CLEAR, I HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF"
1104,00:36:17.07,00:36:17.07,"EVERYBODY, BECAUSE ANYBODY COULD"
1105,00:36:18.17,00:36:18.17,BE COMING FOR ME?
1106,00:36:19.13,00:36:19.13,I DEFINITELY AGREE.
1107,00:36:20.33,00:36:20.33,"I FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW, WE STILL"
1108,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,DON'T KNOW WHO IS ON WHOSE SIDE.
1109,00:36:24.37,00:36:24.37,AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE A COUPLE
1110,00:36:25.57,00:36:25.57,OF TRIBAL COUNCILS TO FIGURE IT
1111,00:36:27.77,00:36:27.77,"OUT, AND SEE WHO IS LOYAL TO WHO"
1112,00:36:30.90,00:36:30.90,AND WHO'S GOING TO BE THE ONE ON
1113,00:36:33.33,00:36:33.33,TOP.
1114,00:36:33.77,00:36:33.77,"Jeff: CHRISTINA, SIX WOMEN,"
1115,00:36:35.77,00:36:35.77,"FIVE MEN, IS THERE ANY TALK THAT"
1116,00:36:38.10,00:36:38.10,IT MIGHT STILL BE MEN VERSUS
1117,00:36:40.13,00:36:40.13,WOMEN?
1118,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,"I'M SURE, YEAH."
1119,00:36:42.00,00:36:42.00,BUT THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF
1120,00:36:43.57,00:36:43.57,THE NEW ALLIANCES THAT THEY
1121,00:36:45.33,00:36:45.33,BUILD FROM THE SALANI TRIBE AND
1122,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,THE MANONO TRIBE.
1123,00:36:47.93,00:36:47.93,Jeff: WHEN WE SWITCHED.
1124,00:36:49.03,00:36:49.03,RIGHT.
1125,00:36:49.73,00:36:49.73,AND I THINK THAT'S WHY A LOT OF
1126,00:36:52.43,00:36:52.43,PEOPLE AREN'T REALLY SURE IF
1127,00:36:53.97,00:36:53.97,THEY ARE GOING OR NOT.
1128,00:36:56.07,00:36:56.07,Jeff: TARZAN.
1129,00:36:57.00,00:36:57.00,"WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT, JEFF,"
1130,00:36:58.70,00:36:58.70,BUT WE'RE ALL JUST PLAYING YOU

1133,00:37:02.93,00:37:02.93,WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID IS THE

1135,00:37:06.67,00:37:06.67,PRIOR TO COMING HERE ONE WOULD
1136,00:37:08.87,00:37:08.87,THINK WOULD BE RELATIVELY FIRM
1137,00:37:09.97,00:37:09.97,"AND NOT SO WISHY-WASHY, AND IF"
1138,00:37:13.73,00:37:13.73,WE REVEAL TOO MUCH IT WILL RUIN
