212,00:10:06.37,00:10:06.37,INCHES CLOSER TO THE FINISH.
213,00:10:07.93,00:10:07.93,THIS COULD DO IT.
214,00:10:08.67,00:10:08.67,THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET TO THE PLATFORM FROM HERE.
215,00:10:11.50,00:10:11.50,TYLER'S ACROSS.

238,00:11:24.33,00:11:24.33,BEING ON A REWARD WITH HIM IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT

280,00:13:14.53,00:13:14.53,HE WILL WIN.
281,00:13:15.43,00:13:15.43,SHIRIN WILL VOTE FOR WHOEVER WE SAY.

293,00:13:43.93,00:13:43.93,BECAUSE HE'S A THREAT.
294,00:13:44.77,00:13:44.77,YOU HAVE TO STRIKE WHEN YOU GET THE CHANCE.

314,00:14:26.57,00:14:26.57,ONE.
315,00:14:27.07,00:14:27.07,MY NEXT MOVE IS TO GET MIKE AND SHIRIN OUT OF HERE AND GET TO
316,00:14:30.87,00:14:30.87,THE STRONG SIX AND THEN RODNEY WORKS HIS MAGIC.
317,00:14:44.57,00:14:44.57,>> THIS IS GREAT.

329,00:15:09.00,00:15:09.00,THERE'S NO SHIRIN.

602,00:29:24.93,00:29:24.93,>> WHAT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS THAT DAN AND SIERRA COMBINATION.

612,00:29:59.07,00:29:59.07,BOTH OF YOURSELF AND KILL ME.
613,00:30:05.40,00:30:05.40,>> THAT' POSSIBILITY.

615,00:30:08.03,00:30:08.03,IT FEELS PRETTY AWESOME.

619,00:30:17.50,00:30:17.50, TO DO IN ORDER TO GET MYSELF FURTHER IN THIS GAME.

621,00:30:23.43,00:30:23.43,YOU DON'T DO IT?
622,00:30:24.70,00:30:24.70,YOU GO TO THE END OF GAME AGAINST TYLER AND YOU LOSE.
623,00:30:27.07,00:30:27.07,>> I AGREE.
624,00:30:27.87,00:30:27.87,I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT.
625,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,>> YOU...

627,00:30:33.77,00:30:33.77,">> IF I MAKE IT TO THE END, I MADE ENOUGH MOVES TO GET THERE"
628,00:30:37.30,00:30:37.30,AND I CAN POINT OUT ALL THE MOVES THAT I HAVE DONE ALONG THE
629,00:30:39.83,00:30:39.83,WAY.
630,00:30:40.03,00:30:40.03,>> THERE WAS A TIME IN THIS GAME WHEN I WOULD HAVE SAID DAN WAS

632,00:30:49.27,00:30:49.27,THAT I COULD CONVINCE HIM OF HOW LOYAL I TRULY AM TO HIM.
633,00:30:53.93,00:30:53.93,BUT DAN IS UNWILLING TO GIVE ME A CHANCE.
634,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,"SO NOW I SEE WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE TRULY IS, AND IT'S SAD THAT"
635,00:31:02.37,00:31:02.37,YOU PUT YOUR FAITH AND TRUST IN SOMEONE AND THEY TURN OUT BEING
636,00:31:06.23,00:31:06.23,A LOT DIFFERENT THAN YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE.

640,00:31:14.80,00:31:14.80,THIS WHOLE GAME I'VE BEEN PLAYING 90 TO NOTHING.
641,00:31:18.10,00:31:18.10,THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME STRATEGY TO BE THOUGHT OF ABOUT
642,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,"USING THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL TONIGHT, FOR THE SIMPLE FACT"
643,00:31:25.53,00:31:25.53,THAT I COULD GET A BIG THREAT OUT OF THIS GAME.

645,00:31:32.90,00:31:32.90,CONSIDER.

648,00:31:38.40,00:31:38.40,>> EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE VOTING SHIRIN.
649,00:31:40.87,00:31:40.87,I COULD LITERALLY GIVE THE IDOL TO SHIRIN AND SHAKE THIS GAME UP
650,00:31:46.47,00:31:46.47,AGAIN.
651,00:31:47.80,00:31:47.80,LET'S SEE WHERE THE CHIPS FALL AND MAYBE THOSE CHIPS WILL FALL
652,00:31:51.00,00:31:51.00,IN MY DIRECTION.
653,00:32:07.87,00:32:07.87,>> Jeff: WE NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

656,00:32:24.27,00:32:24.27,>> YEAH.
657,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,>> Jeff: YOU WERE SHARING VERY PERSONAL STORIES ABOUT THE FACT
658,00:32:28.90,00:32:28.90,"THAT YOU'RE ALONE, YOU HAVE NO FAMILY AND YOU WERE EXPLAINING"
659,00:32:31.73,00:32:31.73,WHY YOU HAVE NO FAMILY.
660,00:32:33.07,00:32:33.07,"AND YET A LOT OF PEOPLE COME INTO THIS GAME AND SAY, WELL,"
661,00:32:36.23,00:32:36.23,"BACK HOME I GOT MY FAMILY, I CAN TRUST THEM."
662,00:32:38.67,00:32:38.67,>> YEAH.
663,00:32:39.57,00:32:39.57,TRUST IS VERY HARD TO COME BY IN MY LIFE.
664,00:32:42.07,00:32:42.07,I HAVE A MOTHER THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT
665,00:32:45.33,00:32:45.33,CLOSE BECAUSE OF WHAT WE WENT THROUGH.
666,00:32:47.10,00:32:47.10,LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT I'LL BE SHARING THIS EXPERIENCE WITH ARE
667,00:32:49.43,00:32:49.43,"MY BOYFRIEND AND HIS FAMILY AND MY BEST FRIEND, AND THAT'S"
668,00:32:52.87,00:32:52.87,FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS.

675,00:33:12.73,00:33:12.73,DIFFERENT THAN HERS.
676,00:33:14.57,00:33:14.57,>> Jeff: SO YOU HAD DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN YOUR UPBRINGING?
677,00:33:16.63,00:33:16.63,>> I'M AN ADOPTED CHILD.

683,00:33:30.27,00:33:30.27,THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HE VERBALLY ASSAULTED ME AND HE
684,00:33:32.67,00:33:32.67,TOOK MY FAMILY SITUATION AND REALLY MADE LIGHT OF IT.

689,00:33:42.47,00:33:42.47,AND I TOLD HER I WAS SORRY THE WHOLE THING HAD HAPPENED.
