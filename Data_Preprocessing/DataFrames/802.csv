40,00:03:31.03,00:03:31.03,I tried to sleep. I didn't get a single wink of
41,00:03:33.10,00:03:33.10,sleep all night long. I sat upright in the shelter all
42,00:03:35.83,00:03:35.83,"night, rocking back and forth, trying to stay warm, 'cause we"
43,00:03:38.93,00:03:38.93,were all soaking wet. >> Vietnam was the same as

51,00:04:01.87,00:04:01.87,rest of us are squeezing together in our shelter.
52,00:04:05.13,00:04:05.13,"And he was drinking well water before we could boil safely,"
53,00:04:08.47,00:04:08.47,even after we'd been told specifically that there are some
54,00:04:11.90,00:04:11.90,crazy parasites in there that will put you in a coma.
55,00:04:14.67,00:04:14.67,"Rudy, are you still drinking that well water?"
56,00:04:17.30,00:04:17.30,">> Oh, yes, he is. >> Well, at this"
57,00:04:19.83,00:04:19.83,"point, he's drank so much. ( laughing )"

61,00:04:30.07,00:04:30.07,will hit you pretty quick. But once Rudy decides he wants

63,00:04:36.57,00:04:36.57,He does what he wants. >> There used to be a
64,00:04:39.90,00:04:39.90,little bar next to where we lived in Utah.
65,00:04:42.57,00:04:42.57,"You know, they'd serve ice, which was rare."
66,00:04:45.20,00:04:45.20,"And I asked them, ""Where did you get the water?"""
67,00:04:47.67,00:04:47.67,"They said the reservoir. At any given time, you could see"
68,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43,"six bodies floating around in that reservoir, you know?"
69,00:04:53.00,00:04:53.00,>> Aw... >> Did you drink it with
70,00:04:55.33,00:04:55.33,ice? >> Yeah.
71,00:04:56.93,00:04:56.93,">> Oh, geez. >> And I should worry"
72,00:04:58.93,00:04:58.93,about this? >> Wow.
73,00:05:01.00,00:05:01.00,( chuckles ) >> Dehydration may be our
74,00:05:12.63,00:05:12.63,biggest concern at this point. We haven't been able to achieve
75,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,"fire, thus we have not been able to boil the water from our water"
76,00:05:18.47,00:05:18.47,source. >> Our tongues had
77,00:05:21.77,00:05:21.77,turned white. It was just so hot.
78,00:05:24.07,00:05:24.07,"We were just dying of thirst. >> Initially, the rain"
79,00:05:36.13,00:05:36.13,"came, and you're thinking, ""Okay, I got to keep dry."""
80,00:05:38.43,00:05:38.43,"But after a few minutes of that, the light bulb went on."
81,00:05:40.87,00:05:40.87,And all of us realized that fresh water was falling from the
82,00:05:43.47,00:05:43.47,sky. >> I never thought I'd
83,00:05:48.70,00:05:48.70,be so happy to see tropical rain.
84,00:05:50.83,00:05:50.83,"We were like animals gone wild. I mean, we had to have water."
85,00:05:54.40,00:05:54.40,That water was so sweet. >> I think if it keeps
86,00:05:57.03,00:05:57.03,"going like this for a few more minutes, I'll drink my fill."
87,00:06:02.00,00:06:02.00,">> Hopefully, it'll rain for quite a while."
88,00:06:04.70,00:06:04.70,"It's nice and warm. It's just wet, wet, wet, wet,"
89,00:06:07.37,00:06:07.37,wet. >> My take on Richard's
90,00:06:11.77,00:06:11.77,"choice to be, you know, a nudist out here... honestly it doesn't"
91,00:06:15.70,00:06:15.70,"bother me in the least. Every time he drops trou, and"
92,00:06:18.93,00:06:18.93,comes just stumbling back into camp without a stitch of
93,00:06:22.30,00:06:22.30,"clothing on, it was hilarious. >> It's nice out there."
94,00:06:25.57,00:06:25.57,"It's not cold. My thing is, sitting under there"
95,00:06:28.67,00:06:28.67,"trying to avoid drops, it gets cold."
96,00:06:31.60,00:06:31.60,">> The bad part is, the rest of us are becoming"
97,00:06:33.97,00:06:33.97,comfortable with it. That's what's even spooky.
98,00:06:37.10,00:06:37.10,"We got an overweight, gay, naked man walking around, and no one"
99,00:06:41.73,00:06:41.73,seems to let it bother them. I don't know.
100,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,"Unfortunately, I think he wants us all to be naked and natural"
101,00:06:47.43,00:06:47.43,walking around. That I don't see happening.

104,00:07:03.80,00:07:03.80,>> You would have thought that maybe we were drinking
105,00:07:07.13,00:07:07.13,"champagne, but it was just getting water from the rain."
106,00:07:10.30,00:07:10.30,>> \xe2\x99\xaa Nobody knows The words

118,00:08:02.80,00:08:02.80,"It feels like something substantial, whatever it is."
119,00:08:05.03,00:08:05.03,>> Maybe it's an animal. It's always interesting when
120,00:08:07.37,00:08:07.37,"they give you boxes. You know, you go through all the"
121,00:08:09.60,00:08:09.60,options of what you'd want to be in there...
122,00:08:11.90,00:08:11.90,>> Food. >> Matches or something.

124,00:08:17.33,00:08:17.33,'cause it's like a gift. >> They brought this
125,00:08:19.33,00:08:19.33,so we could stare at it and wonder what's in it for the next

132,00:08:35.53,00:08:35.53,"We just smash it open. >> No, I don't want to ruin"

241,00:14:14.13,00:14:14.13,lock box. I'm going to tell you what's in
242,00:14:16.57,00:14:16.57,the lock box: Rice. >> ALL: Oh!
243,00:14:17.87,00:14:17.87,">> Oh, man. >> PROBST: Only problem is, that"
244,00:14:19.70,00:14:19.70,"lock box and the rice in it does you no good, because you need"
245,00:14:22.43,00:14:22.43,"three keys to get it open, and even if you had it open without"
246,00:14:25.20,00:14:25.20,"fire, you can't cook the rice. So, here's the offer."
247,00:14:28.10,00:14:28.10,You can trade the blankets for this-- the first clue to finding
248,00:14:31.03,00:14:31.03,the first key to get in your lock box.
249,00:14:33.53,00:14:33.53,Flint. You'll have a constant source of
250,00:14:36.43,00:14:36.43,"fire, and a pot to cook that rice in."
251,00:14:38.90,00:14:38.90,There's a rub. If you take...
252,00:14:43.83,00:14:43.83,the pot with the clue and the map and the flint instead of the
253,00:14:47.73,00:14:47.73,"blankets, Mogo Mogo gets it, as well as Chapera."
254,00:14:53.13,00:14:53.13,>> Oh. ( all talking )

266,00:15:42.23,00:15:42.23,Holy crap. That thing kind of blew me out
267,00:15:45.20,00:15:45.20,"of the water. Tina, first one out."
268,00:15:47.90,00:15:47.90,"Big targets on the winners, except me."
269,00:15:50.70,00:15:50.70,No. It was a big target on me.
270,00:15:53.27,00:15:53.27,Ha! We'll see.
271,00:15:56.30,00:15:56.30,">> Me, I'm surprised, but at the same time, it's cool,"
272,00:15:59.07,00:15:59.07,because it sets the tone for the whole game.
273,00:16:01.57,00:16:01.57,>> There's no... >> Tina's first out.
274,00:16:03.70,00:16:03.70,We all know what... It's business this time.
275,00:16:14.13,00:16:14.13,>> It was tough. That was probably the toughest
276,00:16:16.13,00:16:16.13,challenge I've ever experienced...
277,00:16:18.13,00:16:18.13,>> That might be the hardest challenge I've done
278,00:16:19.80,00:16:19.80,on Survivor. >> ...in any Survivor.
279,00:16:22.37,00:16:22.37,">> When we showed up to the challenge, and I saw Tina"
280,00:16:24.87,00:16:24.87,"was voted out of the game, that made me very excited, because I"
281,00:16:28.63,00:16:28.63,think that she's a big phony. And if it means that the winners
282,00:16:31.03,00:16:31.03,"are going next, that's all right by me."
283,00:16:33.30,00:16:33.30,"But the last time I checked, I didn't have a million dollars"
284,00:16:36.50,00:16:36.50,yet. >> You want to get some
285,00:16:41.90,00:16:41.90,fire going? >> Let's try to get the
286,00:16:43.43,00:16:43.43,"fire. Let's go, Tommy, first try."
287,00:16:46.50,00:16:46.50,"There it is, there it is, there it is."
288,00:16:49.77,00:16:49.77,">> Yeah, there's a coating on the flint, and you"
289,00:16:51.77,00:16:51.77,"got to get all the coating off, and then you can strike it."
290,00:16:53.63,00:16:53.63,>> Big Tom knows what he's doing.
291,00:16:55.40,00:16:55.40,">> I came back here, and I knew exactly how to build a"
292,00:16:58.90,00:16:58.90,"fire and get it started, but of course, Boston Rob and Big Tom--"
293,00:17:02.60,00:17:02.60,these guys are so macho. They're the men.
294,00:17:04.97,00:17:04.97,"They're the men of the tribe. >> Tommy, you're getting"
295,00:17:10.87,00:17:10.87,sparks already. >> Can we build a nest
296,00:17:12.40,00:17:12.40,"right on it and-and light it from here, as opposed to that"
297,00:17:14.00,00:17:14.00,"little...? >> Yeah, let's try to do"
298,00:17:16.00,00:17:16.00,it. >> Because...
299,00:17:17.90,00:17:17.90,">> Well, uh, really that's great, but, uh..."
300,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,">> Can I try it? >> Yeah, try it."
301,00:17:24.80,00:17:24.80,">> Right now, old farm boy's just got to keep his mouth"
302,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,shut. It's too early in the game to be
303,00:17:30.53,00:17:30.53,bossy. I think we got four or five
304,00:17:33.33,00:17:33.33,bosses and maybe one Indian. >> Make sure it's fluffy.
305,00:17:35.27,00:17:35.27,>> Want me to scrape a little bit of the magnesium on there?
306,00:17:37.40,00:17:37.40,">> Yeah, you want air. >> Yeah, go ahead,"
307,00:17:39.13,00:17:39.13,scrape a little magnesium on it. >> Lots of air.
308,00:17:40.87,00:17:40.87,>> Awesome. That's good. That's all you have to do.
309,00:17:43.10,00:17:43.10,>> Alicia's just talking a little bit too much.
310,00:17:45.53,00:17:45.53,>> Don't-don't move away from the fire.
311,00:17:47.63,00:17:47.63,>> She walks around giving orders constantly.
312,00:17:50.00,00:17:50.00,It's her nature. She got a big mouth.
313,00:17:51.63,00:17:51.63,She needs to learn to shut it. >> You got it.
314,00:17:54.20,00:17:54.20,"There you go, you got it. That's it."
315,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,That's all we needed. Beautiful.
316,00:17:58.17,00:17:58.17,>> Yee-ha! >> That was...
317,00:17:59.57,00:17:59.57,>> We got it. We got it going on.
318,00:18:01.23,00:18:01.23,>> There you go. >> Sweet.
319,00:18:02.87,00:18:02.87,>> There'll be no more rubbing of sticks together.
320,00:18:17.73,00:18:17.73,">> Oh, my God. >> Oh!"
321,00:18:19.73,00:18:19.73,( grunts ) >> That was flame.
322,00:18:21.67,00:18:21.67,"Oh, my God. In the first two min..."
323,00:18:24.47,00:18:24.47,"Oh, my God, I'm getting excited. >> Our lives are about to"
324,00:18:27.50,00:18:27.50,change for the better. >> It's still going to
325,00:18:32.37,00:18:32.37,be very hard. This is showing me that I'm
326,00:18:35.77,00:18:35.77,"not... You know, I thought I was an"
327,00:18:38.50,00:18:38.50,"outdoors man, and I am, with a lighter."
328,00:18:41.63,00:18:41.63,"( laughs ) >> Hello, water."
329,00:18:47.20,00:18:47.20,I don't know. You're much stronger than I am.
330,00:18:49.27,00:18:49.27,>> You don't think I'm the biggest...?
331,00:18:50.80,00:18:50.80,"After my display today, you don't think I'm the biggest"
332,00:18:52.67,00:18:52.67,target that's out there right now?
333,00:18:54.67,00:18:54.67,">> Yeah. I felt really bad for Ethan,"
334,00:18:56.53,00:18:56.53,because he knows he's on the chopping block.
335,00:18:58.33,00:18:58.33,"And then, it was even worse at the reward challenge when he did"
336,00:19:00.40,00:19:00.40,so well. And I went to congratulate him
337,00:19:02.67,00:19:02.67,"like I did everyone else, and I was, like, ""Great job."""
338,00:19:05.23,00:19:05.23,"And he's, like, ""Yeah."" 'Cause he knows it's all for"
339,00:19:07.67,00:19:07.67,naught. We don't know when we're going
340,00:19:12.07,00:19:12.07,to lose immunity. We might not lose.
341,00:19:14.03,00:19:14.03,It might be nine days. Who knows?
342,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,"Just give it a couple of days rest, okay?"
343,00:19:18.10,00:19:18.10,>> I already had a talk with Jenna Lewis.
344,00:19:20.27,00:19:20.27,"She says, ""Well, you know, maybe we'll keep you around a little"
345,00:19:23.20,00:19:23.20,"longer, you know, if that's what you wanted."""
346,00:19:25.23,00:19:25.23,"Oh, thanks, Jenna. You know, thanks for granting me"
347,00:19:27.60,00:19:27.60,"that one wish. It's like she's, like, so cocky,"
348,00:19:29.70,00:19:29.70,"calling the shots and stuff, and it just bugs me."
349,00:19:37.50,00:19:37.50,">> Whoa! >> Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,"
350,00:19:39.50,00:19:39.50,"oh, yeah... >> Wait."
351,00:19:42.80,00:19:42.80,"Don't blow too hard, you're just gonna blow it out."
352,00:19:45.20,00:19:45.20,>> There's a fire. There's a fire going.
353,00:19:46.77,00:19:46.77,">> Sticks, more sticks. >> There you are."
354,00:19:49.43,00:19:49.43,"There you go. >> Some more, some more."
355,00:19:51.60,00:19:51.60,More sticks. >> I'll blow it from
356,00:19:52.93,00:19:52.93,this side. >> We got plenty of sticks.
357,00:19:58.60,00:19:58.60,"Whoo! >> Jesus! Aah, aah."
358,00:20:00.83,00:20:00.83,Damn it. I'm all right.
359,00:20:02.67,00:20:02.67,">> Oh, God. >> Stupid me puts my face"
360,00:20:04.97,00:20:04.97,two inches from the fire. Whap!
361,00:20:07.03,00:20:07.03,"It singed all of the hair off the front of my head, but we"
362,00:20:10.77,00:20:10.77,have fire. It's like the power of the gods.
363,00:20:13.20,00:20:13.20,>> I see that. >> Yay!
364,00:20:16.03,00:20:16.03,>> Yay! >> We got fire!
365,00:20:18.60,00:20:18.60,Yay! >> It's joy.
366,00:20:28.10,00:20:28.10,>> It's wet. Here comes the rain.
367,00:20:30.10,00:20:30.10,">> It starts pouring, we may need to postpone this."
368,00:20:32.77,00:20:32.77,We made a huge effort to try to make fire.
369,00:20:36.63,00:20:36.63,"I don't know what the deal is. I don't know if it's... if, at"
370,00:20:39.10,00:20:39.10,"this point, it's a function of our materials or our level of"
371,00:20:41.53,00:20:41.53,energy that there are too many conditions that are working
372,00:20:43.93,00:20:43.93,"against us, because the humidity's so high."
373,00:20:46.33,00:20:46.33,>> Oh! >> Let me blow from the bottom.
374,00:20:49.10,00:20:49.10,>> It's going to pour any second.
375,00:20:51.00,00:20:51.00,">> No, it's not. >> Look at that."

566,00:35:22.10,00:35:22.10,harder to vote him off. And then Rupert walks out into
567,00:35:25.57,00:35:25.57,"the water, and it's amazing. A fish?!"
568,00:35:28.43,00:35:28.43,>> We got our first one. >> Well done.
569,00:35:31.40,00:35:31.40,>> We're having fish tonight.
570,00:35:33.77,00:35:33.77,">> Damn straight. >> Oh, my God."
571,00:35:36.23,00:35:36.23,">> He's little, but he's got some meat."
572,00:35:38.83,00:35:38.83,Oh-ho...! >> Wow!
573,00:35:41.70,00:35:41.70,">> Now, Rupert goes out. Five minutes later, he comes"
574,00:35:44.70,00:35:44.70,back with a fish. Great.
575,00:35:46.67,00:35:46.67,">> Come here, Ethan. Dig in there."
576,00:35:48.83,00:35:48.83,">> Wow, that's yummy. >> That ain't a bad fish,"
577,00:35:51.03,00:35:51.03,you know? >> Love trigger.
578,00:35:53.47,00:35:53.47,"He's a great fish. >> You know, I'm struggling"
579,00:35:55.80,00:35:55.80,"out here. I'm trying to find my niche, and"
580,00:35:58.43,00:35:58.43,"it's not working. >> PROBST: So, Rupert, how has"
581,00:36:22.03,00:36:22.03,"fire improved life at camp? >> Last time we were here,"
582,00:36:25.97,00:36:25.97,"we were... sad, we were whipped. Three days with no food and"
583,00:36:31.77,00:36:31.77,"water. Day four came, we won the"
584,00:36:34.77,00:36:34.77,"challenge, we gave everybody fire."
585,00:36:37.97,00:36:37.97,We were the victors. Whew! It was a great day.
586,00:36:42.37,00:36:42.37,>> PROBST: Let's talk about today's challenge.
587,00:36:44.60,00:36:44.60,"From where I was watching, I was trying to figure out who was"
588,00:36:48.40,00:36:48.40,"going to come in second, because Saboga clearly had it won."
589,00:36:51.50,00:36:51.50,"And then, Ethan, what happened? >> Well, we made a silly"
590,00:36:55.13,00:36:55.13,mistake. Instead of pulling the boat up
591,00:36:57.80,00:36:57.80,"entirely out of the water and dumping it, we tried to bail it"
592,00:37:01.37,00:37:01.37,"while it was still full. >> PROBST: Jerri, did today's"
593,00:37:04.60,00:37:04.60,"loss set you guys back in terms of, now you're going to be down"
594,00:37:07.77,00:37:07.77,to four after tonight? >> Absolutely.
595,00:37:09.30,00:37:09.30,"It's our second time in a row here, and that always sucks."
596,00:37:12.50,00:37:12.50,"It just sucks coming here, period."
597,00:37:14.93,00:37:14.93,">> PROBST: How about you, Rudy? What is it about this game that"
598,00:37:17.73,00:37:17.73,continues to appeal to you? You've survived situations much
599,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,worse than this. >> I really don't know why
600,00:37:25.47,00:37:25.47,I'm here again. ( chuckles )
601,00:37:27.53,00:37:27.53,"I'm three years slower, that's for sure."
602,00:37:30.47,00:37:30.47,"But I like it. You know, putting up with the"
603,00:37:33.10,00:37:33.10,"people is the survival part, not putting up with the elements."
604,00:37:38.30,00:37:38.30,>> PROBST: How are you hanging in there physically?
605,00:37:40.30,00:37:40.30,">> Good. I got a sore ankle, but I think"
606,00:37:43.10,00:37:43.10,"it's going away. >> PROBST: Rupert, new guy on"
607,00:37:47.27,00:37:47.27,"the block, but obviously, you could be odd man out."
608,00:37:51.03,00:37:51.03,">> Oh, yes. I'm always going to feel that"
609,00:37:53.70,00:37:53.70,"odd man out. Um, my one saving grace right"
610,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,"now, I caught a fish. I caught a fish."
611,00:37:59.37,00:37:59.37,( laughter ) I poked it with a stick.
612,00:38:01.83,00:38:01.83,I caught a fish. >> PROBST: Rupert starts
613,00:38:04.67,00:38:04.67,"catching fish, he becomes much more valuable. Ethan?"
614,00:38:07.53,00:38:07.53,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Did you have any
615,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,reaction when Rupert came in with the fish?
616,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,>> I was psyched that I was going to eat.
617,00:38:13.47,00:38:13.47,"( laughter ) I mean, yeah, I didn't catch a"
618,00:38:15.50,00:38:15.50,"fish first, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to catch ten"
619,00:38:17.53,00:38:17.53,"tomorrow. >> PROBST: Ethan, it appeared"
620,00:38:19.77,00:38:19.77,"last time that Tina was voted out, if for no other reason than"
621,00:38:22.53,00:38:22.53,"she's won this game before, and nobody wanted her to win again."
622,00:38:25.50,00:38:25.50,The only other guy on this block tonight that's won this game is
623,00:38:28.20,00:38:28.20,you. So how are you feeling?
624,00:38:30.37,00:38:30.37,>> I feel nervous. Tribal Council's a scary place.
625,00:38:33.90,00:38:33.90,"My insides are upside down, flipping around, just like that"
626,00:38:37.27,00:38:37.27,"fish we caught today. I have a target on my back, and"
627,00:38:40.07,00:38:40.07,it's out there in the open. >> PROBST: So how do you vote
628,00:38:42.77,00:38:42.77,"tonight? Jenna, is there a chance"
629,00:38:45.33,00:38:45.33,"that it's still a money issue? >> Yeah, there's still"
630,00:38:47.97,00:38:47.97,a chance. People are voted out of this
631,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,"game all the time for being too strong, too alpha male, too much"
632,00:38:54.43,00:38:54.43,of a provider. What's the difference?
633,00:38:56.20,00:38:56.20,Those people don't deserve to go.
634,00:38:58.20,00:38:58.20,"They're providing for their tribes, but people see them as"
635,00:39:00.43,00:39:00.43,competition. The winners have already won.
636,00:39:03.20,00:39:03.20,That's a strong competition. So it's just like any other way
637,00:39:07.20,00:39:07.20,"to vote, if you see it that way. >> PROBST: Okay, it's time to"
638,00:39:11.33,00:39:11.33,"vote. Jerri, you're up."
639,00:39:33.93,00:39:33.93,">> Rudy, it was an honor to be on your team, but this is"
640,00:39:36.73,00:39:36.73,"purely strategical. >> Ethan, you're tough."
641,00:39:57.20,00:39:57.20,"Rudy and I made a pact, and I am not voting for Rudy."
642,00:40:02.10,00:40:02.10,"I got to vote for you, Ethan. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
643,00:40:13.10,00:40:13.10,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
644,00:40:29.43,00:40:29.43,decision is final. The person voted out will be
645,00:40:31.43,00:40:31.43,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
646,00:40:33.80,00:40:33.80,I'll read the votes. First vote... Rudy.
647,00:40:42.43,00:40:42.43,"Ethan. One vote Ethan, one vote Rudy."
648,00:40:49.60,00:40:49.60,"Ethan. Two votes Ethan, one vote Rudy."
649,00:40:54.93,00:40:54.93,"Rudy. Two votes Rudy, two votes Ethan."
650,00:40:59.43,00:40:59.43,I'll read the last vote. Second person voted out of the
651,00:41:05.23,00:41:05.23,Saboga Tribe... Rudy. You need to bring me your torch.
652,00:41:17.43,00:41:17.43,"Rudy, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
653,00:41:36.10,00:41:36.10,"Well, Tribal Council is an interesting place, always"
654,00:41:39.07,00:41:39.07,emotional. Tonight was no exception.
655,00:41:42.47,00:41:42.47,"How could you not like Rudy? 75-year-old former Navy SEAL,"
656,00:41:46.17,00:41:46.17,hanging with kids a third of his age: a hero in anybody's book.
657,00:41:53.10,00:41:53.10,"I know you didn't want to vote him out, and yet somebody had to"
658,00:41:55.47,00:41:55.47,"go, which is exactly what makes Survivor what it is:"
659,00:42:00.23,00:42:00.23,"complicated. Grab your torches, head on back"
660,00:42:04.50,00:42:04.50,to camp. Good night.

667,00:42:29.60,00:42:29.60,for years. >> Rupert's a complete
668,00:42:31.43,00:42:31.43,control freak. Let's just ... do it.
669,00:42:33.50,00:42:33.50,>> Jerri and Rupert got in a fight. Perfect.
670,00:42:36.57,00:42:36.57,That's just what I wanted. >> PROBST: While Richard faces

674,00:42:51.80,00:42:51.80,everything was all set up to vote Ethan off.
675,00:42:56.60,00:42:56.60,"And, uh, I can see Ethan voting against me, but I can't see the"
676,00:42:59.87,00:42:59.87,"other two people voting against me, and if I was them, I'd stay"
677,00:43:03.57,00:43:03.57,clear of me. I got a lot of friends.
678,00:43:06.60,00:43:06.60,That's about all I got to say.
