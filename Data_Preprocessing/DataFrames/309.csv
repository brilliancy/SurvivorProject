15,00:02:08.03,00:02:08.03,have kind of a unanimousconsensus.
16,00:02:09.77,00:02:09.77,Everyone was going to be votingfor Clarence and then there were
17,00:02:12.10,00:02:12.10,"two votes that came in with myname and them, and I was, you"
18,00:02:14.27,00:02:14.27,"know, I was really surprised.I kind of figured that Clarence"
19,00:02:16.70,00:02:16.70,"would vote for me, but when thesecond vote came in, I was"
20,00:02:18.87,00:02:18.87,pissed off.I was furious.
21,00:02:20.27,00:02:20.27,>> I know it's not me.It's not you.
22,00:02:22.87,00:02:22.87,It's not Tom for sure.>> Nope.

24,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,The person that threw that voteat me and that now chooses to
25,00:02:31.07,00:02:31.07,"hide, torques me and it pissesme off that I can't figure it"
26,00:02:34.27,00:02:34.27,out and smoke him out rightaway.
27,00:02:36.17,00:02:36.17,I will not live with a snake.>> Yeah.
28,00:02:38.10,00:02:38.10,">> I will cut the head off ofwhoever it is that did this, and"
29,00:02:41.50,00:02:41.50,whoever it is that has poisonedthis with scheming and lying is
30,00:02:44.97,00:02:44.97,going to go down next.>> Mm-hmm.
31,00:02:46.77,00:02:46.77,">> That is just the way it is,and I'm going to take him out."
32,00:02:50.23,00:02:50.23,I'm going to slit their throats.>> This morning Lex was just a
33,00:02:55.13,00:02:55.13,total jerk.I mean what do you expect in
34,00:02:57.50,00:02:57.50,this game?I mean I'm sorry.
35,00:02:59.27,00:02:59.27,"Someone voted against you,Mr. Ego."
36,00:03:00.93,00:03:00.93,Deal with it.>> It was not me.
37,00:03:02.33,00:03:02.33,>> You swear on your brother?You'd swear on your brother's
38,00:03:05.03,00:03:05.03,name?>> I'd swear on my brother's
39,00:03:06.90,00:03:06.90,name.I'd swear on both my parents.
40,00:03:09.07,00:03:09.07,I really would.I'll look you in the eye.
41,00:03:11.17,00:03:11.17,">> You are?>> I am, I am."
42,00:03:12.73,00:03:12.73,"I promise you.>> Okay, it really wasn't me,"
43,00:03:14.93,00:03:14.93,"but screw you, Lex, if you'regoing to sit here and yell at me"
44,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10,like you're my dad and I'm fiveand I just stole cookies for
45,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17,something I didn't do.>> Did you sleep well?
46,00:03:24.27,00:03:24.27,>> I did.I'm a pretty happy camper.
47,00:03:27.40,00:03:27.40,">> This one little vote is soinconsequential to the game, and"
48,00:03:30.80,00:03:30.80,it has so much to do with Lex'sego that I really could care
49,00:03:34.13,00:03:34.13,less what happens with it.Somebody was just screwing with
50,00:03:37.47,00:03:37.47,"his head, and it worked.It makes me wish I had done it."
51,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83,>> Is there anything I can helpyou with for breakfast?
52,00:03:44.13,00:03:44.13,>> I was going to try that soup.What would you think of that?
53,00:03:46.63,00:03:46.63,">> Sure.At this point in the game, I'm"
54,00:03:48.60,00:03:48.60,worried about the fact thatthere's a snake amongst us and I
55,00:03:51.27,00:03:51.27,don't know who it is.That person could act like
56,00:03:54.07,00:03:54.07,"cancer and start rotting,rotting our plans from the"
57,00:03:57.27,00:03:57.27,inside out.And that's why we need to smoke
58,00:03:59.93,00:03:59.93,them out.>> Lex was just distraught.
59,00:04:05.00,00:04:05.00,"I mean it was just terrible.He said, ""All I could think"
60,00:04:07.70,00:04:07.70,"about was who was the one thatvoted"" for him, and, I mean, I"
61,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30,didn't think it would be thatmuch of an impact.
62,00:04:12.37,00:04:12.37,"I thought, shoot, ten votes:he got two, didn't get eight."
63,00:04:15.23,00:04:15.23,"Well, what's the big deal?He's here."
64,00:04:17.03,00:04:17.03,But it wasn't like that a bit.>> I'm just not even going to...
65,00:04:20.60,00:04:20.60,I'm not even going to thinkabout it anymore.
66,00:04:23.43,00:04:23.43,It was because somebody aroundhere is claiming to be something
67,00:04:27.40,00:04:27.40,that they're not.>> Right.
68,00:04:29.00,00:04:29.00,">> Of course they figure thatClarence had voted him, but they"
69,00:04:32.27,00:04:32.27,had to figure out who the otherperson was.
70,00:04:35.20,00:04:35.20,It was me.I mean I did it.
71,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13,"I'm sick that I did it now, butlike I said, I didn't think it"
72,00:04:42.80,00:04:42.80,"would be such an ordeal.>> You know, I want, I want you"
73,00:04:45.23,00:04:45.23,"to know that I have, I have nosuspicion at all as far as"
74,00:04:48.00,00:04:48.00,you're concerned and I'm justgoing to let this thing go now
75,00:04:50.90,00:04:50.90,"that whoever it is, is probablygoing to hang themselves, and"
76,00:04:53.87,00:04:53.87,"that's the way it is, you know.And I wish I knew definitively"
77,00:04:58.70,00:04:58.70,"for sure, because then I wouldjust take care of it, who to"
78,00:05:02.63,00:05:02.63,"give it next.>> Yeah, right."
79,00:05:04.50,00:05:04.50,Mama didn't raise no fool.I'm going to keep quiet for a
80,00:05:08.13,00:05:08.13,"while longer, just because,well, I'm not really ready"
81,00:05:11.50,00:05:11.50,"to go.>> From the moment I met you,"
82,00:05:13.87,00:05:13.87,"I knew that I could trust you,and I trust my gut over my, over"
83,00:05:17.73,00:05:17.73,"my eyes any day and my gut toldme that you're, you're the real"
84,00:05:21.63,00:05:21.63,"deal, so...>> Thanks, Lex."
85,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60,>> Thank you.So...
86,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,">> All along I played with beingstraight up with everybody, and"
87,00:05:29.93,00:05:29.93,"now I'm not straight up withthem for obvious reasons, and I"
88,00:05:32.93,00:05:32.93,don't know where to go with itnow.
89,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,"It bothers me.It bothers me a lot, actually."
90,00:05:37.40,00:05:37.40,"I hate this game.>> Oh, one of these little,"
91,00:05:45.63,00:05:45.63,weird music-makers.♪♪

190,00:12:34.80,00:12:34.80,"winning, but didn't.Lex because he came in second"
191,00:12:37.47,00:12:37.47,and that's my only clarificationfor coming.
192,00:12:39.87,00:12:39.87,">> Lex, let's go.>> Yeah!"
193,00:12:42.27,00:12:42.27,"Way to go.>> Have fun, Lex."
194,00:12:44.10,00:12:44.10,>> Good choice.>> He came in second.
195,00:12:45.97,00:12:45.97,He battled me.>> Good choice.
196,00:12:47.47,00:12:47.47,">> Good choice.>> If you get to trade Lex, you"
197,00:12:50.50,00:12:50.50,"know, you get some more stuff.>> Good luck."
198,00:12:53.70,00:12:53.70,">> Bye, guys.>> Look at that."
199,00:13:10.53,00:13:10.53,This is crazy.>> We had to keep a couple of
200,00:13:17.97,00:13:17.97,goats calm and keep them stillbecause the whole point of the
201,00:13:21.70,00:13:21.70,trip was for us to take twogoats into this village and be
202,00:13:24.63,00:13:24.63,able to trade or barter them formoney so we could buy some
203,00:13:27.33,00:13:27.33,goods.But the ride was so bumpy.
204,00:13:29.60,00:13:29.60,I mean it was an absoluteball-buster.
205,00:13:31.80,00:13:31.80,">> Oh...>> Oh, my gosh."
206,00:13:43.83,00:13:43.83,>> We finally arrived.The town ended up being named
207,00:13:47.67,00:13:47.67,"Wamba.It was a small little village,"
208,00:13:50.40,00:13:50.40,"maybe one street, with stores onit."
209,00:13:58.53,00:13:58.53,>> The whole thing was a surrealexperience.
210,00:14:01.13,00:14:01.13,>> I'm experiencing extremeculture shock.
211,00:14:03.43,00:14:03.43,">> I am, too.>> I didn't know that when we"
212,00:14:05.63,00:14:05.63,"got into the village, that itwould be up to Ethan and I to"
213,00:14:08.90,00:14:08.90,actually get the goats off.We got to get the goats.
214,00:14:12.57,00:14:12.57,>> This is going to be purecomedy.
215,00:14:15.40,00:14:15.40,">> No, it's not that bad.>> We already had a crowd of the"
216,00:14:24.47,00:14:24.47,"locals, you know, watching twovery out-of-place guys chucking"
217,00:14:29.10,00:14:29.10,goats out of huge trucks.We were the laughingstock before
218,00:14:33.03,00:14:33.03,"we even set foot in the village.Now, you won this, right?"
219,00:14:36.23,00:14:36.23,"This was like, this was, thiswas a reward, right?"
220,00:14:39.03,00:14:39.03,">> Yeah, it was.Yeah, it was."
221,00:14:40.60,00:14:40.60,>> This is not a punishment or ahazing.
222,00:14:42.83,00:14:42.83,">> I know nothing about goats,and I was looking around for"
223,00:14:46.50,00:14:46.50,"some sort of hint, some sort ofdirection, and just got nothing."
224,00:14:54.10,00:14:54.10,"Everyone is staring at us, andyou're definitely in the hot"
225,00:14:56.97,00:14:56.97,"seat.>> We don't stand out, though,"
226,00:14:58.90,00:14:58.90,"do we?>> No, not at all."
227,00:15:00.57,00:15:00.57,>> I was panicked.I had no idea what to do.
228,00:15:02.83,00:15:02.83,We just started shopping themaround.
229,00:15:08.47,00:15:08.47,>> I'm selling a goat.Are you interested in buying a
230,00:15:12.87,00:15:12.87,"goat?$1,500."

233,00:15:20.83,00:15:20.83,They know where they're going.I'm selling a goat.
234,00:15:23.37,00:15:23.37,Anybody interested?Somebody already offered us
235,00:15:28.03,00:15:28.03,"1,000 for this one.Do you want to buy a goat?"
236,00:15:31.43,00:15:31.43,You know who wants to buy goats?>> No.
237,00:15:34.57,00:15:34.57,>> He'll grow.He's just young.
238,00:15:37.00,00:15:37.00,He's a baby.>> You want to sell the small
239,00:15:39.30,00:15:39.30,one?>> We want to sell them both.
240,00:15:41.23,00:15:41.23,"1,800.>> 1,800 is too much money."

242,00:15:49.33,00:15:49.33,>> Okay.Thank you.
243,00:15:50.87,00:15:50.87,>> Thank you.>> Want to see where they're

245,00:15:57.90,00:15:57.90,"somewhere and get 2,000.>> We could have got attached to"
246,00:16:01.50,00:16:01.50,the goats on that 3h-hour trip.I thought maybe they were going
247,00:16:04.97,00:16:04.97,to end up in a flock and theywere going to be these happy
248,00:16:07.17,00:16:07.17,"goats that kind of, you know,cruise around the countryside"
249,00:16:10.00,00:16:10.00,eating grass and maybe mating orwhatever.
250,00:16:12.43,00:16:12.43,"We saw him turn around with thetwo goats and he made a beeline,"
251,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,not 20 feet away from usstraight into the butchery.
252,00:16:18.60,00:16:18.60,">> Oh, they got a good deal.>> Be that as it may, we had 25"
253,00:16:21.80,00:16:21.80,bucks to spend.(crowing)
254,00:16:36.43,00:16:36.43,>> We were clearly a couple ofthings to see in that village.
255,00:16:40.53,00:16:40.53,We had a constant kind ofentourage that followed us
256,00:16:43.00,00:16:43.00,"around, many of which weren'teven talking to us."
257,00:16:45.33,00:16:45.33,"They were just staring at us.Somebody from the village,"
258,00:16:51.23,00:16:51.23,"obviously the guy that's in theknow, or hooked up with"
259,00:16:54.13,00:16:54.13,"everybody, immediately latchedon to us and said, ""I can take"
260,00:16:57.47,00:16:57.47,"you to the best place in town."">> Is it good food?"
261,00:17:00.23,00:17:00.23,">> Yeah, good food.A good restaurant there."
262,00:17:02.43,00:17:02.43,>> All right.>> We're going to be eating
263,00:17:07.10,00:17:07.10,"here.We sat down, and asked for a"

265,00:17:11.43,00:17:11.43,"guy basically told us, ""Yeah, wehave three things here."""
266,00:17:16.33,00:17:16.33,The maize we didn't wantanything to do with because
267,00:17:18.07,00:17:18.07,that's the mush we'reeating here.
268,00:17:19.70,00:17:19.70,Meat we weren't feeling supersafe about because we saw a lot
269,00:17:22.13,00:17:22.13,of cats kind of milling around.We weren't quite sure what that
270,00:17:25.37,00:17:25.37,"meant.And then French fries sounded, I"
271,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,"mean, right off the bat thatsounded great."
272,00:17:29.90,00:17:29.90,">> Two chips and then a bigsoda, beer."
273,00:17:35.53,00:17:35.53,Thank you.>> This is incredible.
274,00:17:49.80,00:17:49.80,>> I got a soda and Lex got abeer.
275,00:17:53.90,00:17:53.90,>> Thank you very much.>> And it was cold and it was
276,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,crisp.>> Cheers.
277,00:17:57.67,00:17:57.67,>> Thank you for the trip.>> No problem.
278,00:18:04.30,00:18:04.30,">> Oh, yes.This is the best French fries"
279,00:18:08.03,00:18:08.03,I've ever had in my life.The platters were huge.
280,00:18:11.83,00:18:11.83,"They were swimming in about aneighth of an inch of, like,"
281,00:18:15.47,00:18:15.47,"grease or oil, which was perfectbecause I have gone without fat"
282,00:18:19.70,00:18:19.70,"or lard or grease for a month.And I'm telling you, it was like"
283,00:18:24.27,00:18:24.27,ambrosia.Are you all right?
284,00:18:26.43,00:18:26.43,>> Yeah.>> I think the French fries were
285,00:18:29.03,00:18:29.03,a definite shock to my system.I mean my stomach has shrunk
286,00:18:32.57,00:18:32.57,"significantly.I don't regret it, but you know,"
287,00:18:36.90,00:18:36.90,it went right through me.It's like solitary confinement.
288,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,I wouldn't want to go thereagain.
289,00:18:49.77,00:18:49.77,"That's for sure.But you had to do it, you know,"
290,00:18:52.97,00:18:52.97,"you can't not do it.Oh, my God."
291,00:18:56.07,00:18:56.07,">> Oh, yeah.My stomach hasn't felt full in a"
292,00:18:59.43,00:18:59.43,long time out here.The feeling was great.
293,00:19:02.80,00:19:02.80,Next on our agenda was trying tofind sweets and goods for the
294,00:19:06.57,00:19:06.57,"tribe.You'll be fair with us, right?"
295,00:19:11.33,00:19:11.33,">> Yes, sure, I will be.Make you happy, also."
296,00:19:15.67,00:19:15.67,">> We went to a marketplace.Unfortunately, after our"
297,00:19:19.13,00:19:19.13,"thousand-shilling meal, we wereonly left with about 600"
298,00:19:21.73,00:19:21.73,shillings to get a whole bunchof stuff for the tribe.
299,00:19:26.87,00:19:26.87,">> This is nice, dude.>> You got a good one there."
300,00:19:32.53,00:19:32.53,>> I have sunglasses.>> Sunglasses?
301,00:19:36.07,00:19:36.07,Yeah.>> That's nice.
302,00:19:40.47,00:19:40.47,"I don't really need that.But, yeah, maybe."
303,00:19:42.83,00:19:42.83,Just hold on to it.Maybe.
304,00:19:44.37,00:19:44.37,"You just let me know.This, this, this, for two hats."
305,00:19:52.20,00:19:52.20,">> I was bartering and you know,I was trying to get a lot for"
306,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,a hat.>> So all I have is this and

308,00:19:59.30,00:19:59.30,"think?>> Oh, and I have this shirt."
309,00:20:01.67,00:20:01.67,I traded right off my back oneof my Reebok long-sleeved
310,00:20:05.60,00:20:05.60,"T-shirts.They gave me a price, and I gave"
311,00:20:09.67,00:20:09.67,them my shirt off my back.I gave them my hat off my head.
312,00:20:14.97,00:20:14.97,"For even just two hours, I was alittle bit part of their life"
313,00:20:18.33,00:20:18.33,and see how things work.I had brought this hacky sack as
314,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,"my luxury item and I'm, like,you know, ""When am I going to"
315,00:20:27.10,00:20:27.10,"use this?""And so we just started, you"

322,00:20:50.23,00:20:50.23,a soccer player.>> The smiles on their faces
323,00:20:53.70,00:20:53.70,"were, you know, amazing.And I think I made their day."
324,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,"And then as we were leaving, I,you know, I threw it to one of"
325,00:20:58.93,00:20:58.93,"the little ones and I gave himmy hacky sack and he was, like,"

327,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,It's hard to describe in wordseverything that was going on in

329,00:21:12.07,00:21:12.07,"that, you know, I'll never beable to forget."
330,00:21:14.10,00:21:14.10,>> Thank you.That was business.

339,00:22:05.73,00:22:05.73,that I don't think would havehappened if he had stayed.
340,00:22:11.10,00:22:11.10,">> This is going to be so muchfun, just kind of satisfying."

345,00:22:27.47,00:22:27.47,So I think it'll be a majorD-day invasion going on.

349,00:22:43.93,00:22:43.93,>> The downside of going on areward challenge and being away
350,00:22:47.67,00:22:47.67,"for the whole day is, you know,people have a chance to plot"

354,00:22:58.73,00:22:58.73,you don't want to piss anyoneoff.

360,00:23:10.87,00:23:10.87,the fact that it was probablytough for them to be left behind
361,00:23:12.30,00:23:12.30,while we went off and had areally great time and ate a

372,00:23:42.40,00:23:42.40,"Oh, my God, thank you so much.>> You are amazing."
373,00:23:44.70,00:23:44.70,>> Thank you.>> Ethan made them look so good.
374,00:23:47.00,00:23:47.00,He deserved every bit of credithe got for bringing those
375,00:23:49.97,00:23:49.97,"cookies back.>> Ethan, we love you so much."
376,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,>> Thank you so much.These are fabulous.
377,00:23:54.83,00:23:54.83,>> Mmm.>> These are good.
378,00:24:03.93,00:24:03.93,>> Good?>> That feels great.
379,00:24:05.43,00:24:05.43,"Thank you, Frank.Okay, do you know where you're"
380,00:24:07.33,00:24:07.33,"going?>> Oh, no, my shorts."
381,00:24:10.40,00:24:10.40,">> Okay, this is what I gather.T told me that you're correct."
382,00:24:14.03,00:24:14.03,Lex does think you voted forhim.
383,00:24:16.10,00:24:16.10,">> I refuse to spend my timehere kissing up to him,"
384,00:24:19.00,00:24:19.00,trying to convince him I didn'tvote against him.
385,00:24:20.77,00:24:20.77,>> He might not be around.>> I was trying to work a little
386,00:24:23.10,00:24:23.10,"bit on Kelly, in seeing whetheror not she might come and vote"
387,00:24:25.70,00:24:25.70,"with us because she is reallykind of upset with Lex, but I"
388,00:24:28.20,00:24:28.20,don't want to push her too hard.So I'm waiting to see what
389,00:24:30.60,00:24:30.60,happens at the immunitychallenge.
390,00:24:32.10,00:24:32.10,">> I'm not going to say thatwould make me sad, but after"
391,00:24:34.13,00:24:34.13,what happened last time I'm kindof gun-shy about...
392,00:24:36.10,00:24:36.10,">> Kim-- she kind of asked me tovote with them, and I said no, I"
393,00:24:38.90,00:24:38.90,"have to vote with my tribe, but,you know, best of luck with your"
394,00:24:41.70,00:24:41.70,little coup and we'll see whathappens.
395,00:24:43.43,00:24:43.43,Are you sure Frank's not inon that?
396,00:24:44.87,00:24:44.87,">> Yeah, Frank's definitely inon this."
397,00:24:46.30,00:24:46.30,"Kelly said she wasn't going tovote for Lex, but I think"
398,00:24:48.17,00:24:48.17,there's part of her that doeswant to vote with us because she
399,00:24:50.40,00:24:50.40,doesn't want Lex to be around.>> That's thinking with your
400,00:24:52.80,00:24:52.80,head.>> Everything lays on the next
401,00:24:55.07,00:24:55.07,"immunity challenge.I mean, if Lex wins it, it's"
402,00:24:57.57,00:24:57.57,kind of back to game overfor us.
403,00:24:59.50,00:24:59.50,"So everything lays on that.>> PROBST: How's it going, guys?"
404,00:25:19.13,00:25:19.13,>> Great.>> Good.
405,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,">> PROBST: First things first.Teresa, I hate to take it back,"
406,00:25:23.10,00:25:23.10,but...>> You got to do what you got
407,00:25:24.67,00:25:24.67,to do.>> PROBST: Did you like having
408,00:25:26.20,00:25:26.20,that?>> I loved having it.
409,00:25:27.63,00:25:27.63,>> PROBST: Immunity back up forgrabs today.

473,00:29:37.33,00:29:37.33,"You got five.Sorry, Lex."
474,00:29:41.23,00:29:41.23,Brandon's still the number tobeat with six.
475,00:29:43.70,00:29:43.70,"Big Tom, you got one, two, threefour, five, six."
476,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.20,This is not right.You're still alive with six.

483,00:30:14.90,00:30:14.90,>> PROBST: You cannot be votedout at tonight's Tribal Council.
484,00:30:17.13,00:30:17.13,The rest of you guys have theafternoon to think about it.
485,00:30:19.80,00:30:19.80,I'll see you tonight for anothervote.
486,00:30:48.07,00:30:48.07,>> Don't worry about it.>> Please.
487,00:30:49.53,00:30:49.53,>> Don't worry about it.>> All right.
488,00:30:51.03,00:30:51.03,"The last three days, since ourlast Tribal Council, have been"
489,00:30:54.43,00:30:54.43,"pretty interesting.There was that mystery vote, and"
490,00:30:57.23,00:30:57.23,my goal was in three days tofigure out who it was that cast
491,00:31:00.43,00:31:00.43,that vote.After putting two and two
492,00:31:05.83,00:31:05.83,"together, gathering a lot ofinformation, kind of observing"
493,00:31:09.40,00:31:09.40,"things, it became really evidentthat my worst fears were more"
494,00:31:14.30,00:31:14.30,and more likely than notwere true.
495,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,>> Tom?>> Yeah.
496,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,">> Hey, I had a shift withBrandon this morning."
497,00:31:19.97,00:31:19.97,>> Yeah?>> And he heard Kelly talking to
498,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,Frank and T-bird and hedistinctly heard her say the
499,00:31:26.43,00:31:26.43,"words ""free agent."">> Free agent."
500,00:31:29.10,00:31:29.10,">> Yeah, there is absolutely nodoubt in my mind now that"
501,00:31:33.33,00:31:33.33,Kelly's turning.>> That she's the rat?
502,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,We're shooting a harpoon shotthat it's Kelly.
503,00:31:38.90,00:31:38.90,"It's hard for me to go againstmy tribe mate, and I like little"
504,00:31:43.30,00:31:43.30,"Kelly, but all indications isit's her."
505,00:31:45.70,00:31:45.70,But we really haven't gottenanything concrete on that.
506,00:31:49.13,00:31:49.13,">> So I talked to Brandon.I said, ""Look, I would like you"
507,00:31:52.77,00:31:52.77,to take Kelly's spot as ourfifth member.
508,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,"You will be the fifth one fromthe top."""
509,00:31:58.30,00:31:58.30,"My gut tells me, without doubt,that I can trust him."
510,00:32:03.83,00:32:03.83,"You know my gut is good.>> Right, so far it's been"
511,00:32:07.10,00:32:07.10,pretty good.Lex is putting his trust in
512,00:32:09.27,00:32:09.27,Brandon.I didn't really get to
513,00:32:11.33,00:32:11.33,interrogate Kelly enough to makesure she's that rat.
514,00:32:14.33,00:32:14.33,"Everything points to her, but Iwill feel like hell if we have"
515,00:32:18.77,00:32:18.77,kicked one of our own teammembers off over Lex's gut
516,00:32:23.30,00:32:23.30,"feeling.All right, well, then how will"
517,00:32:26.60,00:32:26.60,the vote go?How will we do it?
518,00:32:29.23,00:32:29.23,">> Me, you, Ethan...>> Kim, Johnson and Brandon,"
519,00:32:34.43,00:32:34.43,five.So I say we cut Kelly off
520,00:32:37.37,00:32:37.37,tonight.It all fits.
521,00:32:39.60,00:32:39.60,That's why we have to take herout tonight.
522,00:32:41.30,00:32:41.30,">> If his gut feeling ain'tright, we've done Kelly an"
523,00:32:44.13,00:32:44.13,injustice and we've done ourselfan injustice.
524,00:32:46.60,00:32:46.60,>> Are you sure?>> I'm sure.
525,00:32:59.07,00:32:59.07,">> Ever since the immunitychallenge, things have been very"
526,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,"different, different thanthey've ever been before."
527,00:33:04.93,00:33:04.93,Lex hasn't been laying down theorders of who I'm supposed to
528,00:33:07.50,00:33:07.50,"vote for, who we're supposed tovote for, so I have no clue"
529,00:33:09.97,00:33:09.97,really what's going on.>> You want to know what's going
530,00:33:12.73,00:33:12.73,"on?>> Well, yeah."
531,00:33:14.23,00:33:14.23,">> Well, we've kind of...we've hit an impasse."
532,00:33:17.30,00:33:17.30,>> I can tell.>> I've made a commitment to
533,00:33:19.73,00:33:19.73,"myself to try to... that by thetime the third day came, I was"
534,00:33:22.93,00:33:22.93,"going to try to sniff out therat and whoever that was, that's"
535,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,"who would get my vote.Now, if that means that we're,"
536,00:33:29.77,00:33:29.77,"that we're splintering at thispoint, so be it."
537,00:33:33.50,00:33:33.50,"But I... you know, it doesn'tseem that alliances are what"
538,00:33:36.87,00:33:36.87,they used to be.>> I don't know.
539,00:33:38.70,00:33:38.70,"I thought, you know...I mean, whatever."
540,00:33:40.83,00:33:40.83,If everyone's made up their mindthen that's fine.
541,00:33:43.53,00:33:43.53,"The whole thing about the voteagainst you wasn't me, so if"
542,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,"that would be anyone's reason tovote against me, I would really"
543,00:33:50.20,00:33:50.20,hope there was more to it thanthat.
544,00:33:52.27,00:33:52.27,>> It's going to be what it'sgoing to be.
545,00:33:55.03,00:33:55.03,So...>> All right.
546,00:33:56.63,00:33:56.63,>> Okay?>> My butt is on the line
547,00:33:58.50,00:33:58.50,"because, you know, my ownteammates are all trying to turn"
548,00:34:01.27,00:34:01.27,"against me, and I'm just, like,""This is ridiculous."""
549,00:34:03.73,00:34:03.73,I feel like my only realstrategy is to try to defect and
550,00:34:07.53,00:34:07.53,team up with the four fromSamburu.
551,00:34:09.80,00:34:09.80,">> Are you okay?>> Oh, I'm fine."
552,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,I don't even know what'sgoing on.
553,00:34:12.80,00:34:12.80,"They're just like, ""We don'twant to have an alliance"
554,00:34:14.47,00:34:14.47,"anymore.""Everyone wants to vote for"
555,00:34:16.10,00:34:16.10,"different people.Okay, then we can all vote our"
556,00:34:17.60,00:34:17.60,"own way.>> That's fine, I mean."
557,00:34:19.07,00:34:19.07,">> Then I'll vote for Lex.>> I'll vote for Lex, too."
558,00:34:20.83,00:34:20.83,>> You have my word.I'll vote for Lex.
559,00:34:22.23,00:34:22.23,">> If I change for any reason,I will come and let you know."
560,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"But I'll try and work on T-bird.All right, I'll let you know."
561,00:34:27.67,00:34:27.67,">> We've got Kelly.I don't know that I trust Kelly,"
562,00:34:32.10,00:34:32.10,"but at this point, I don't havea choice not to."
563,00:34:34.40,00:34:34.40,She's our only hope.>> Are you sure?

566,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,"You don't trust her long-term,do you?"
567,00:34:45.80,00:34:45.80,>> Yes.>> Are you sure?
568,00:34:47.43,00:34:47.43,>> Positive.>> We have to get Lex out
569,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,"because it's Kelly, me, Brandon,you Frank, you know, gone."
570,00:34:53.10,00:34:53.10,">> If we don't all do it,it's not going to work."
571,00:34:56.37,00:34:56.37,It won't work.>> I know.
572,00:34:58.70,00:34:58.70,I know.>> Brandon's absolutely sure?
573,00:35:03.77,00:35:03.77,">> He's definitely in.If it changes, I will let you"
574,00:35:07.13,00:35:07.13,know.>> Man.
575,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,"I can trust you, right?>> Yes."
576,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,">> Yeah, I know that.>> My old team is looking for me"
577,00:35:27.03,00:35:27.03,"to do what we talked aboutyesterday, which is vote"
578,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83,"for Lex.But then again, Lex flat out"
579,00:35:30.63,00:35:30.63,told me this morning that theywanted me to vote Kelly off
580,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,tonight.Now I'm feeling like I'm in a
581,00:35:34.97,00:35:34.97,power play position and thatwasn't what I had planned and
582,00:35:37.27,00:35:37.27,it's very awkward for me and Idon't know what I'm
583,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,going to do yet.I honestly don't know.
584,00:36:18.80,00:36:18.80,>> PROBST: Welcome.Looking forward to another good
585,00:36:21.60,00:36:21.60,Tribal Council.Ethan...
586,00:36:23.00,00:36:23.00,>> Yeah?>> PROBST: This is sort of your
587,00:36:24.50,00:36:24.50,"week.>> Yeah, it happened to be a"
588,00:36:26.07,00:36:26.07,good week for me.>> PROBST: You're dominating
589,00:36:27.87,00:36:27.87,everything.Let's talk about the reward.
590,00:36:29.87,00:36:29.87,"A scale of one to ten, how goodof an experience was that?"
591,00:36:32.50,00:36:32.50,">> It was a ten, for sure, oneof the best days of my life."
592,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,And a day I'll never forget andno one can take that away from
593,00:36:38.93,00:36:38.93,"me, no matter what happens inthe game."
594,00:36:40.83,00:36:40.83,">> PROBST: Tom, what does go onwhen two people leave?"
595,00:36:43.77,00:36:43.77,What kind of a void does thatcreate?
596,00:36:45.70,00:36:45.70,">> There's more talking, youknow, among different people."
597,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"The circles are not as tight,and it was a day that everybody"
598,00:36:54.03,00:36:54.03,"was running around like achicken with their head cut off,"
599,00:36:57.73,00:36:57.73,talking to everybody.And so I didn't know what to
600,00:37:00.67,00:37:00.67,think.So it was definitely different.
601,00:37:02.80,00:37:02.80,">> PROBST: Kim, did the thoughtoccur to you, you know, what,"
602,00:37:05.67,00:37:05.67,"maybe I don't want to go on areward because as Tom said,"
603,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,there's a lot of talking thatgoes on at camp.
604,00:37:10.53,00:37:10.53,"Maybe that's more important, tobe there?"
605,00:37:13.10,00:37:13.10,">> Yeah, you know, you do thinkabout it."
606,00:37:14.97,00:37:14.97,But I don't think that anybodyreally would say that they'd
607,00:37:17.43,00:37:17.43,"want to give up a reward andjust stay there and see, you"
608,00:37:19.77,00:37:19.77,"know, what was going on in camplife."
609,00:37:21.50,00:37:21.50,"I mean, it's so important to usto win rewards and it's such a"
610,00:37:23.80,00:37:23.80,great experience.What they did was so amazing.
611,00:37:26.10,00:37:26.10,"It's not, it's not like youwould miss that much in camp"
612,00:37:28.80,00:37:28.80,life.>> PROBST: Let's talk about last
613,00:37:30.57,00:37:30.57,"week's vote.Lex, surprised to get votes?"
614,00:37:34.20,00:37:34.20,">> I was pretty surprised to geta couple of votes, and it was"
615,00:37:37.03,00:37:37.03,"definitely something thatoccupied a lot of my, a lot of"
616,00:37:39.63,00:37:39.63,my thoughts the last three days.>> PROBST: Why were you
617,00:37:42.07,00:37:42.07,surprised?Because normally when I ask you
618,00:37:44.30,00:37:44.30,"guys, everybody says, ""Oh, Ireally feel vulnerable tonight."
619,00:37:47.03,00:37:47.03,"It certainly could be my night.""And yet when you get a vote,"
620,00:37:49.60,00:37:49.60,"it's like, ""Who the hell votedfor me?"""
621,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,">> Well, I think that's just anatural reaction."
622,00:37:53.53,00:37:53.53,"Everybody feels vulnerable here,but that doesn't mean that you"
623,00:37:56.50,00:37:56.50,expect to get votes.And yet when you see your name
624,00:37:59.43,00:37:59.43,"on one of those little cards, Imean, it changes everything."
625,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"It's hard.But yeah, the burning question"
626,00:38:06.70,00:38:06.70,"was: ""Who wrote my name down onthe paper?"""
627,00:38:10.03,00:38:10.03,">> PROBST: Well, you guys havemade it a long ways."
628,00:38:12.80,00:38:12.80,"24 days, you're down to aone-in-nine shot at a million"
629,00:38:15.77,00:38:15.77,bucks at this point.Let's find out who's out of the
630,00:38:18.57,00:38:18.57,game.It's time to vote.
631,00:38:20.30,00:38:20.30,"Lex, you're up first.>> Kelly, if I'm wrong about"
632,00:38:33.67,00:38:33.67,"you, then I apologize, but Ismell a rat, and my gut tells me"
633,00:38:38.13,00:38:38.13,"that you stabbed me in the back,and you're playing both sides."
634,00:38:41.97,00:38:41.97,"And if that's the case, thengood riddance."
635,00:38:57.37,00:38:57.37,">> When it's me, you'll know it.I couldn't be more excited to be"
636,00:39:01.80,00:39:01.80,"casting this vote.I never wanted you to win, and"
637,00:39:04.70,00:39:04.70,"now I hope you won't.If this is the last vote I cast,"
638,00:39:07.43,00:39:07.43,"then at least I got a vote foryou, who I've always found to be"
639,00:39:10.33,00:39:10.33,not fun to be around.>> This is a kicker.
640,00:39:40.03,00:39:40.03,"I made a promise to Lex that Iwould vote this way tonight, and"
641,00:39:43.93,00:39:43.93,"I'm probably going to bite it,but I really am doing it to make"
642,00:39:48.23,00:39:48.23,"it to the final four at least.So, um, sorry, Kelly."
643,00:39:55.40,00:39:55.40,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
644,00:40:10.00,00:40:10.00,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
645,00:40:12.20,00:40:12.20,The person will be asked toleave the Tribal Council area
646,00:40:14.53,00:40:14.53,"immediately.Before I get to the vote, I just"
647,00:40:16.60,00:40:16.60,"want to remind you guys that,beginning tonight, the person"
648,00:40:19.10,00:40:19.10,voted out of the tribe does notleave the game.
649,00:40:21.10,00:40:21.10,They will return and be a partof the jury and will have a huge
650,00:40:24.20,00:40:24.20,impact on the outcome.You're about to vote somebody
651,00:40:27.33,00:40:27.33,out of this game and then askthem to vote for you to win.
652,00:40:31.40,00:40:31.40,I'll read the votes.First vote: Kelly.

660,00:41:29.60,00:41:29.60,"Kelly.>> Oh, no."
661,00:41:31.30,00:41:31.30,>> PROBST: You need to bring meyour torch.

664,00:41:54.70,00:41:54.70,It's time for you to go.I don't have much to say.
665,00:42:10.27,00:42:10.27,I think Kelly's reaction saidit all.
666,00:42:12.33,00:42:12.33,You guys can head back to camp.We'll see you tomorrow.
667,00:42:31.43,00:42:31.43,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

672,00:42:44.00,00:42:44.00,I thought was my friend.>> PROBST: And Lex's loyalty is
673,00:42:46.87,00:42:46.87,questioned.>> And Lex is beginning to give
674,00:42:50.17,00:42:50.17,"us the shake, you know.>> Last night we had to do"
675,00:42:52.37,00:42:52.37,something to save our ass.I acted and I'm regretting it

677,00:43:02.80,00:43:02.80,"I can't help but be myself,and I've never been too good at"

679,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80,"It was hard for me not to havefriends in different places,"
680,00:43:11.07,00:43:11.07,"and that kind of screwed me,but hey, I made it past the hard"
681,00:43:13.40,00:43:13.40,"part with the boulders andwhatnot, and for a skinny girl,"
682,00:43:15.57,00:43:15.57,"that's kind of, you know, it's abig deal."
