1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.50,00:00:02.50, Survivor: The Boran and Samburu tribes merged into one.
3,00:00:05.67,00:00:05.67,The ten of you have now merged into one tribe.
4,00:00:09.53,00:00:09.53,The first individual immunity challenge was an arm's length
5,00:00:13.87,00:00:13.87,"test of endurance. After more than six hours,"
6,00:00:18.07,00:00:18.07,Clarence and Teresa were the last two standing.
7,00:00:21.17,00:00:21.17,"A game of rock, paper, scissors finally determined the outcome."
8,00:00:28.40,00:00:28.40,"The new tribe bonded over wine, and named themselves Motomaji."
9,00:00:33.83,00:00:33.83,"At Tribal Council, Teresa secretly honored her word and"
10,00:00:37.47,00:00:37.47,voted with Clarence against Lex. Two votes Lex.
11,00:00:40.53,00:00:40.53,But Clarence received the majority and was voted out of
12,00:00:43.80,00:00:43.80,the tribe. The tribe has spoken.
13,00:00:46.47,00:00:46.47,Nine are left. Tonight one more will go.
14,00:02:03.40,00:02:03.40,">> I'm telling you, a dirty chicken."
15,00:02:05.17,00:02:05.17,">> When we went to Tribal Council last night, we seemed to"
16,00:02:08.03,00:02:08.03,have kind of a unanimous consensus.
17,00:02:09.77,00:02:09.77,Everyone was going to be voting for Clarence and then there were
18,00:02:12.10,00:02:12.10,"two votes that came in with my name and them, and I was, you"
19,00:02:14.27,00:02:14.27,"know, I was really surprised. I kind of figured that Clarence"
20,00:02:16.70,00:02:16.70,"would vote for me, but when the second vote came in, I was"
21,00:02:18.87,00:02:18.87,pissed off. I was furious.
22,00:02:20.27,00:02:20.27,>> I know it's not me. It's not you.
23,00:02:22.87,00:02:22.87,It's not Tom for sure. >> Nope.
24,00:02:25.13,00:02:25.13,>> It's not Ethan. >> It's not Ethan.
25,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83,The person that threw that vote at me and that now chooses to
26,00:02:31.07,00:02:31.07,"hide, torques me and it pisses me off that I can't figure it"
27,00:02:34.27,00:02:34.27,out and smoke him out right away.
28,00:02:36.17,00:02:36.17,I will not live with a snake. >> Yeah.
29,00:02:38.10,00:02:38.10,">> I will cut the head off of whoever it is that did this, and"
30,00:02:41.50,00:02:41.50,whoever it is that has poisoned this with scheming and lying is
31,00:02:44.97,00:02:44.97,going to go down next. >> Mm-hmm.
32,00:02:46.77,00:02:46.77,">> That is just the way it is, and I'm going to take him out."
33,00:02:50.23,00:02:50.23,I'm going to slit their throats. >> This morning Lex was just a
34,00:02:55.13,00:02:55.13,total jerk. I mean what do you expect in
35,00:02:57.50,00:02:57.50,this game? I mean I'm sorry.
36,00:02:59.27,00:02:59.27,"Someone voted against you, Mr. Ego."
37,00:03:00.93,00:03:00.93,Deal with it. >> It was not me.
38,00:03:02.33,00:03:02.33,>> You swear on your brother? You'd swear on your brother's
39,00:03:05.03,00:03:05.03,name? >> I'd swear on my brother's
40,00:03:06.90,00:03:06.90,name. I'd swear on both my parents.
41,00:03:09.07,00:03:09.07,I really would. I'll look you in the eye.
42,00:03:11.17,00:03:11.17,">> You are? >> I am, I am."
43,00:03:12.73,00:03:12.73,"I promise you. >> Okay, it really wasn't me,"
44,00:03:14.93,00:03:14.93,"but screw you, Lex, if you're going to sit here and yell at me"
45,00:03:18.10,00:03:18.10,like you're my dad and I'm five and I just stole cookies for
46,00:03:21.17,00:03:21.17,something I didn't do. >> Did you sleep well?
47,00:03:24.27,00:03:24.27,>> I did. I'm a pretty happy camper.
48,00:03:27.40,00:03:27.40,">> This one little vote is so inconsequential to the game, and"
49,00:03:30.80,00:03:30.80,it has so much to do with Lex's ego that I really could care
50,00:03:34.13,00:03:34.13,less what happens with it. Somebody was just screwing with
51,00:03:37.47,00:03:37.47,"his head, and it worked. It makes me wish I had done it."
52,00:03:41.83,00:03:41.83,>> Is there anything I can help you with for breakfast?
53,00:03:44.13,00:03:44.13,>> I was going to try that soup. What would you think of that?
54,00:03:46.63,00:03:46.63,">> Sure. At this point in the game, I'm"
55,00:03:48.60,00:03:48.60,worried about the fact that there's a snake amongst us and I
56,00:03:51.27,00:03:51.27,don't know who it is. That person could act like
57,00:03:54.07,00:03:54.07,"cancer and start rotting, rotting our plans from the"
58,00:03:57.27,00:03:57.27,inside out. And that's why we need to smoke
59,00:03:59.93,00:03:59.93,them out. >> Lex was just distraught.
60,00:04:05.00,00:04:05.00,"I mean it was just terrible. He said, ""All I could think"
61,00:04:07.70,00:04:07.70,"about was who was the one that voted"" for him, and, I mean, I"
62,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30,didn't think it would be that much of an impact.
63,00:04:12.37,00:04:12.37,"I thought, shoot, ten votes: he got two, didn't get eight."
64,00:04:15.23,00:04:15.23,"Well, what's the big deal? He's here."
65,00:04:17.03,00:04:17.03,But it wasn't like that a bit. >> I'm just not even going to...
66,00:04:20.60,00:04:20.60,I'm not even going to think about it anymore.
67,00:04:23.43,00:04:23.43,It was because somebody around here is claiming to be something
68,00:04:27.40,00:04:27.40,that they're not. >> Right.
69,00:04:29.00,00:04:29.00,">> Of course they figure that Clarence had voted him, but they"
70,00:04:32.27,00:04:32.27,had to figure out who the other person was.
71,00:04:35.20,00:04:35.20,It was me. I mean I did it.
72,00:04:39.13,00:04:39.13,"I'm sick that I did it now, but like I said, I didn't think it"
73,00:04:42.80,00:04:42.80,"would be such an ordeal. >> You know, I want, I want you"
74,00:04:45.23,00:04:45.23,"to know that I have, I have no suspicion at all as far as"
75,00:04:48.00,00:04:48.00,you're concerned and I'm just going to let this thing go now
76,00:04:50.90,00:04:50.90,"that whoever it is, is probably going to hang themselves, and"
77,00:04:53.87,00:04:53.87,"that's the way it is, you know. And I wish I knew definitively"
78,00:04:58.70,00:04:58.70,"for sure, because then I would just take care of it, who to"
79,00:05:02.63,00:05:02.63,"give it next. >> Yeah, right."
80,00:05:04.50,00:05:04.50,Mama didn't raise no fool. I'm going to keep quiet for a
81,00:05:08.13,00:05:08.13,"while longer, just because, well, I'm not really ready"
82,00:05:11.50,00:05:11.50,"to go. >> From the moment I met you,"
83,00:05:13.87,00:05:13.87,"I knew that I could trust you, and I trust my gut over my, over"
84,00:05:17.73,00:05:17.73,"my eyes any day and my gut told me that you're, you're the real"
85,00:05:21.63,00:05:21.63,"deal, so... >> Thanks, Lex."
86,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60,>> Thank you. So...
87,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,">> All along I played with being straight up with everybody, and"
88,00:05:29.93,00:05:29.93,"now I'm not straight up with them for obvious reasons, and I"
89,00:05:32.93,00:05:32.93,don't know where to go with it now.
90,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,"It bothers me. It bothers me a lot, actually."
91,00:05:37.40,00:05:37.40,"I hate this game. >> Oh, one of these little,"
92,00:05:45.63,00:05:45.63,weird music-makers. \xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
93,00:05:48.97,00:05:48.97,Okay. >> What is it?
94,00:05:52.87,00:05:52.87,>> This is like an African music-making device.
95,00:05:55.50,00:05:55.50,>> All right. >> Cool.
96,00:05:57.03,00:05:57.03,"You play with your thumbs, and it says, ""Coordination and"
97,00:06:00.53,00:06:00.53,persistence it'll take to win this one.
98,00:06:03.47,00:06:03.47,"You may run out of breath, but I guarantee you'll have some fun."
99,00:06:06.43,00:06:06.43,"You best use all your leverage, focus you don't want to miss,"
100,00:06:09.27,00:06:09.27,"because you haven't seen a reward quite as cool as this."""
101,00:06:11.93,00:06:11.93,Persistence and leverage. >> Focus.
102,00:06:13.90,00:06:13.90,">> But see, leverage is kind of like, you know, like you have to"
103,00:06:17.43,00:06:17.43,push these... I don't know. >> Lex is getting good at that
104,00:06:20.23,00:06:20.23,thing. >> This is fun.
105,00:06:21.73,00:06:21.73,I like having this around. You guys are going to get really
106,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,"sick of this. >> PROBST: All right, guys,"
107,00:06:44.93,00:06:44.93,today's reward challenge is going to require a bit of
108,00:06:47.43,00:06:47.43,"coordination, a whole lot of persistence."
109,00:06:49.37,00:06:49.37,You will each have nine items. Your goal: Get the nine items
110,00:06:52.83,00:06:52.83,"into the basket on top of your tower, using your plank as a"
111,00:06:56.67,00:06:56.67,springboard. So you'll take one item at a
112,00:06:58.97,00:06:58.97,"time, put it at the end of the plank."
113,00:07:01.10,00:07:01.10,"Go to the other side, stomp on it, flinging it into the air"
114,00:07:04.13,00:07:04.13,into your basket. A little bit of wind today.
115,00:07:06.30,00:07:06.30,You'll have to adjust for. It's trial and error.
116,00:07:08.53,00:07:08.53,The first person to get all nine items in their basket wins the
117,00:07:11.03,00:07:11.03,reward. Want to know what your reward
118,00:07:12.47,00:07:12.47,is? >> Yes!
119,00:07:14.20,00:07:14.20,">> PROBST: Charles, Isaac, bring them in."
120,00:07:17.93,00:07:17.93,You guys remember Charles from when we drank blood?
121,00:07:20.03,00:07:20.03,"This is his brother, Isaac. >> Hi."
122,00:07:22.27,00:07:22.27,">> PROBST: The winner gets these two goats, then in the morning,"
123,00:07:26.13,00:07:26.13,"we'll go to a small African village, where you are going to"
124,00:07:29.47,00:07:29.47,"barter these goats for whatever you can get: creature comforts,"
125,00:07:33.27,00:07:33.27,"food, souvenirs, whatever you deem important."
126,00:07:36.17,00:07:36.17,And then the merchant who you trade with will be able to
127,00:07:38.93,00:07:38.93,"increase his herd of goats, which increases his wealth."
128,00:07:41.73,00:07:41.73,"All right, take your spots. Let's get it going."
129,00:07:45.30,00:07:45.30,Survivors ready? Go!
130,00:08:03.07,00:08:03.07,Ethan's got one. Another one for Ethan.
131,00:08:26.03,00:08:26.03,Kim's got one. Lex back in.
132,00:08:41.37,00:08:41.37,Another one for Ethan. Frank's got one.
133,00:08:45.90,00:08:45.90,"How's it going, Kelly? >> I keep breaking my plank."
134,00:08:56.80,00:08:56.80,>> PROBST: Another one for Big Tom.
135,00:09:02.03,00:09:02.03,Another one for Ethan. Brandon on the board.
136,00:09:09.03,00:09:09.03,>> Ah! >> You've got to be joking.
137,00:09:14.70,00:09:14.70,>> PROBST: Frank has his second one in.
138,00:09:20.33,00:09:20.33,Ethan down to two. Lex is down to three.

140,00:09:37.20,00:09:37.20,"Lex down to two. Ethan, you're on your last one,"
141,00:09:40.37,00:09:40.37,but Lex is right on your heels. Big Tom.
142,00:09:47.33,00:09:47.33,Frank's down to four. >> Let's move it. Come on!
143,00:09:54.17,00:09:54.17,">> Woo! >> PROBST: Kelly, welcome to the"
144,00:09:55.90,00:09:55.90,game. Brandon needs three.
145,00:09:58.40,00:09:58.40,Lex needs two. Ethan needs one.
146,00:10:04.07,00:10:04.07,"There it is. That's it, it's over,"
147,00:10:09.87,00:10:09.87,"Ethan wins. >> Good job, Ethan."
148,00:10:11.70,00:10:11.70,">> You did great. >> PROBST: All right, Ethan,"
149,00:10:16.43,00:10:16.43,here's the deal. I'll take good care of your
150,00:10:18.40,00:10:18.40,"goats tonight. Tomorrow morning, show up at"
151,00:10:20.83,00:10:20.83,camp and take your goats. You might want to bring a few
152,00:10:23.50,00:10:23.50,"personal items, if you have them, want to get rid of them,"
153,00:10:25.57,00:10:25.57,"something to barter, might have value."
154,00:10:27.13,00:10:27.13,"We'll go to a small little village, make a day of it."
155,00:10:28.93,00:10:28.93,>> All right. >> PROBST: Congratulations.
156,00:10:56.30,00:10:56.30,">> If that one hat gets everybody something, just do"
157,00:10:58.93,00:10:58.93,"that, I don't care. >> They'll be like, ""it's the"

159,00:11:03.00,00:11:03.00,">> Right now, everyone is giving me some stuff to trade away at"
160,00:11:07.10,00:11:07.10,the old marketplace or wherever I end up.
161,00:11:09.57,00:11:09.57,This hat wants something sweet. This hat might want a belt or a
162,00:11:13.93,00:11:13.93,bracelet. This hat wants...
163,00:11:16.57,00:11:16.57,">> Anything. >> Anything, other than this"
164,00:11:18.97,00:11:18.97,hat. >> Gruel.

168,00:11:33.33,00:11:33.33,We got a little gray gruel going.
169,00:11:35.23,00:11:35.23,>> PROBST: Got a bag full of personal stuff you're going to

176,00:11:54.93,00:11:54.93,"got here? >> Up, up, up."
177,00:11:56.93,00:11:56.93,">> Down, down, down, down. >> Later, guys."
178,00:12:00.37,00:12:00.37,Have a great day. I'll see you.

181,00:12:07.13,00:12:07.13,you can handle those goats. Take a seat by them and make

183,00:12:11.50,00:12:11.50,How do you lay down? I'm not feeling real good about
184,00:12:14.77,00:12:14.77,this. >> PROBST: I think you need to
185,00:12:16.80,00:12:16.80,bring one more person with you. >> Oh.
186,00:12:20.43,00:12:20.43,>> PROBST: Grab somebody because we've got to run.
187,00:12:22.90,00:12:22.90,">> When Jeff said, you know, ""pick somebody,"" my exact"
188,00:12:25.57,00:12:25.57,reaction was I don't want to choose anyone to take because
189,00:12:28.47,00:12:28.47,it's a huge political decision and the only thing I could think
190,00:12:31.70,00:12:31.70,"of quick enough was, you know, the person that was close to"
191,00:12:34.80,00:12:34.80,"winning, but didn't. Lex because he came in second"
192,00:12:37.47,00:12:37.47,and that's my only clarification for coming.
193,00:12:39.87,00:12:39.87,">> Lex, let's go. >> Yeah!"
194,00:12:42.27,00:12:42.27,"Way to go. >> Have fun, Lex."
195,00:12:44.10,00:12:44.10,>> Good choice. >> He came in second.
196,00:12:45.97,00:12:45.97,He battled me. >> Good choice.
197,00:12:47.47,00:12:47.47,">> Good choice. >> If you get to trade Lex, you"
198,00:12:50.50,00:12:50.50,"know, you get some more stuff. >> Good luck."
199,00:12:53.70,00:12:53.70,">> Bye, guys. >> Look at that."
200,00:13:10.53,00:13:10.53,This is crazy. >> We had to keep a couple of
201,00:13:17.97,00:13:17.97,goats calm and keep them still because the whole point of the
202,00:13:21.70,00:13:21.70,trip was for us to take two goats into this village and be
203,00:13:24.63,00:13:24.63,able to trade or barter them for money so we could buy some
204,00:13:27.33,00:13:27.33,goods. But the ride was so bumpy.
205,00:13:29.60,00:13:29.60,I mean it was an absolute ball-buster.
206,00:13:31.80,00:13:31.80,">> Oh... >> Oh, my gosh."
207,00:13:43.83,00:13:43.83,>> We finally arrived. The town ended up being named
208,00:13:47.67,00:13:47.67,"Wamba. It was a small little village,"
209,00:13:50.40,00:13:50.40,"maybe one street, with stores on it."
210,00:13:58.53,00:13:58.53,>> The whole thing was a surreal experience.
211,00:14:01.13,00:14:01.13,>> I'm experiencing extreme culture shock.
212,00:14:03.43,00:14:03.43,">> I am, too. >> I didn't know that when we"
213,00:14:05.63,00:14:05.63,"got into the village, that it would be up to Ethan and I to"
214,00:14:08.90,00:14:08.90,actually get the goats off. We got to get the goats.
215,00:14:12.57,00:14:12.57,>> This is going to be pure comedy.
216,00:14:15.40,00:14:15.40,">> No, it's not that bad. >> We already had a crowd of the"
217,00:14:24.47,00:14:24.47,"locals, you know, watching two very out-of-place guys chucking"
218,00:14:29.10,00:14:29.10,goats out of huge trucks. We were the laughingstock before
219,00:14:33.03,00:14:33.03,"we even set foot in the village. Now, you won this, right?"
220,00:14:36.23,00:14:36.23,"This was like, this was, this was a reward, right?"
221,00:14:39.03,00:14:39.03,">> Yeah, it was. Yeah, it was."
222,00:14:40.60,00:14:40.60,>> This is not a punishment or a hazing.
223,00:14:42.83,00:14:42.83,">> I know nothing about goats, and I was looking around for"
224,00:14:46.50,00:14:46.50,"some sort of hint, some sort of direction, and just got nothing."
225,00:14:54.10,00:14:54.10,"Everyone is staring at us, and you're definitely in the hot"
226,00:14:56.97,00:14:56.97,"seat. >> We don't stand out, though,"
227,00:14:58.90,00:14:58.90,"do we? >> No, not at all."
228,00:15:00.57,00:15:00.57,>> I was panicked. I had no idea what to do.
229,00:15:02.83,00:15:02.83,We just started shopping them around.
230,00:15:08.47,00:15:08.47,>> I'm selling a goat. Are you interested in buying a
231,00:15:12.87,00:15:12.87,"goat? $1,500."
232,00:15:14.30,00:15:14.30,"$1,000? >> I'll give you 500 each."
233,00:15:17.40,00:15:17.40,">> 500 each? >> Oh, no, no, no."
234,00:15:20.83,00:15:20.83,They know where they're going. I'm selling a goat.
235,00:15:23.37,00:15:23.37,Anybody interested? Somebody already offered us
236,00:15:28.03,00:15:28.03,"1,000 for this one. Do you want to buy a goat?"
237,00:15:31.43,00:15:31.43,You know who wants to buy goats? >> No.
238,00:15:34.57,00:15:34.57,>> He'll grow. He's just young.
239,00:15:37.00,00:15:37.00,He's a baby. >> You want to sell the small
240,00:15:39.30,00:15:39.30,one? >> We want to sell them both.
241,00:15:41.23,00:15:41.23,"1,800. >> 1,800 is too much money."
242,00:15:43.37,00:15:43.37,"12, four, 16. >> The best we've gotten so far."
243,00:15:49.33,00:15:49.33,>> Okay. Thank you.
244,00:15:50.87,00:15:50.87,>> Thank you. >> Want to see where they're
245,00:15:54.10,00:15:54.10,taking the goats? They're going to take the goats
246,00:15:57.90,00:15:57.90,"somewhere and get 2,000. >> We could have got attached to"
247,00:16:01.50,00:16:01.50,the goats on that 3h-hour trip. I thought maybe they were going
248,00:16:04.97,00:16:04.97,to end up in a flock and they were going to be these happy
249,00:16:07.17,00:16:07.17,"goats that kind of, you know, cruise around the countryside"
250,00:16:10.00,00:16:10.00,eating grass and maybe mating or whatever.
251,00:16:12.43,00:16:12.43,"We saw him turn around with the two goats and he made a beeline,"
252,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,not 20 feet away from us straight into the butchery.
253,00:16:18.60,00:16:18.60,">> Oh, they got a good deal. >> Be that as it may, we had 25"
254,00:16:21.80,00:16:21.80,bucks to spend. (crowing)
255,00:16:36.43,00:16:36.43,>> We were clearly a couple of things to see in that village.
256,00:16:40.53,00:16:40.53,We had a constant kind of entourage that followed us
257,00:16:43.00,00:16:43.00,"around, many of which weren't even talking to us."
258,00:16:45.33,00:16:45.33,"They were just staring at us. Somebody from the village,"
259,00:16:51.23,00:16:51.23,"obviously the guy that's in the know, or hooked up with"
260,00:16:54.13,00:16:54.13,"everybody, immediately latched on to us and said, ""I can take"
261,00:16:57.47,00:16:57.47,"you to the best place in town."" >> Is it good food?"
262,00:17:00.23,00:17:00.23,">> Yeah, good food. A good restaurant there."
263,00:17:02.43,00:17:02.43,>> All right. >> We're going to be eating
264,00:17:07.10,00:17:07.10,"here. We sat down, and asked for a"
265,00:17:09.27,00:17:09.27,"menu. They didn't have a menu, but the"
266,00:17:11.43,00:17:11.43,"guy basically told us, ""Yeah, we have three things here."""
267,00:17:16.33,00:17:16.33,The maize we didn't want anything to do with because
268,00:17:18.07,00:17:18.07,that's the mush we're eating here.
269,00:17:19.70,00:17:19.70,Meat we weren't feeling super safe about because we saw a lot
270,00:17:22.13,00:17:22.13,of cats kind of milling around. We weren't quite sure what that
271,00:17:25.37,00:17:25.37,"meant. And then French fries sounded, I"
272,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,"mean, right off the bat that sounded great."
273,00:17:29.90,00:17:29.90,">> Two chips and then a big soda, beer."
274,00:17:35.53,00:17:35.53,Thank you. >> This is incredible.
275,00:17:49.80,00:17:49.80,>> I got a soda and Lex got a beer.
276,00:17:53.90,00:17:53.90,>> Thank you very much. >> And it was cold and it was
277,00:17:56.17,00:17:56.17,crisp. >> Cheers.
278,00:17:57.67,00:17:57.67,>> Thank you for the trip. >> No problem.
279,00:18:04.30,00:18:04.30,">> Oh, yes. This is the best French fries"
280,00:18:08.03,00:18:08.03,I've ever had in my life. The platters were huge.
281,00:18:11.83,00:18:11.83,"They were swimming in about an eighth of an inch of, like,"
282,00:18:15.47,00:18:15.47,"grease or oil, which was perfect because I have gone without fat"
283,00:18:19.70,00:18:19.70,"or lard or grease for a month. And I'm telling you, it was like"
284,00:18:24.27,00:18:24.27,ambrosia. Are you all right?
285,00:18:26.43,00:18:26.43,>> Yeah. >> I think the French fries were
286,00:18:29.03,00:18:29.03,a definite shock to my system. I mean my stomach has shrunk
287,00:18:32.57,00:18:32.57,"significantly. I don't regret it, but you know,"
288,00:18:36.90,00:18:36.90,it went right through me. It's like solitary confinement.
289,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,I wouldn't want to go there again.
290,00:18:49.77,00:18:49.77,"That's for sure. But you had to do it, you know,"
291,00:18:52.97,00:18:52.97,"you can't not do it. Oh, my God."
292,00:18:56.07,00:18:56.07,">> Oh, yeah. My stomach hasn't felt full in a"
293,00:18:59.43,00:18:59.43,long time out here. The feeling was great.
294,00:19:02.80,00:19:02.80,Next on our agenda was trying to find sweets and goods for the
295,00:19:06.57,00:19:06.57,"tribe. You'll be fair with us, right?"
296,00:19:11.33,00:19:11.33,">> Yes, sure, I will be. Make you happy, also."
297,00:19:15.67,00:19:15.67,">> We went to a marketplace. Unfortunately, after our"
298,00:19:19.13,00:19:19.13,"thousand-shilling meal, we were only left with about 600"
299,00:19:21.73,00:19:21.73,shillings to get a whole bunch of stuff for the tribe.
300,00:19:26.87,00:19:26.87,">> This is nice, dude. >> You got a good one there."
301,00:19:32.53,00:19:32.53,>> I have sunglasses. >> Sunglasses?
302,00:19:36.07,00:19:36.07,Yeah. >> That's nice.
303,00:19:40.47,00:19:40.47,"I don't really need that. But, yeah, maybe."
304,00:19:42.83,00:19:42.83,Just hold on to it. Maybe.
305,00:19:44.37,00:19:44.37,"You just let me know. This, this, this, for two hats."
306,00:19:52.20,00:19:52.20,">> I was bartering and you know, I was trying to get a lot for"
307,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,a hat. >> So all I have is this and
308,00:19:57.13,00:19:57.13,"this. >> Would she want this one, you"
309,00:19:59.30,00:19:59.30,"think? >> Oh, and I have this shirt."
310,00:20:01.67,00:20:01.67,I traded right off my back one of my Reebok long-sleeved
311,00:20:05.60,00:20:05.60,"T-shirts. They gave me a price, and I gave"
312,00:20:09.67,00:20:09.67,them my shirt off my back. I gave them my hat off my head.
313,00:20:14.97,00:20:14.97,"For even just two hours, I was a little bit part of their life"
314,00:20:18.33,00:20:18.33,and see how things work. I had brought this hacky sack as
315,00:20:24.50,00:20:24.50,"my luxury item and I'm, like, you know, ""When am I going to"
316,00:20:27.10,00:20:27.10,"use this?"" And so we just started, you"
317,00:20:29.13,00:20:29.13,"know, kicking it around and playing."
318,00:20:32.27,00:20:32.27,"Three, four, five. I'm sure they're, like, how the"
319,00:20:34.93,00:20:34.93,"hell does this kid know how to do this, you know, because I'm"
320,00:20:38.23,00:20:38.23,sure they don't see many white people that can play soccer or
321,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,hacky sack. >> You know what his name is?
322,00:20:47.80,00:20:47.80,"Ethan. Back in the United States, he's"
323,00:20:50.23,00:20:50.23,a soccer player. >> The smiles on their faces
324,00:20:53.70,00:20:53.70,"were, you know, amazing. And I think I made their day."
325,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,"And then as we were leaving, I, you know, I threw it to one of"
326,00:20:58.93,00:20:58.93,"the little ones and I gave him my hacky sack and he was, like,"
327,00:21:01.77,00:21:01.77,"""Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you."""
328,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,It's hard to describe in words everything that was going on in
329,00:21:07.97,00:21:07.97,"my head and in my body. But, like, it was an experience"
330,00:21:12.07,00:21:12.07,"that, you know, I'll never be able to forget."
331,00:21:14.10,00:21:14.10,>> Thank you. That was business.
332,00:21:17.43,00:21:17.43,"That was insane. As a life experience, it was a"
333,00:21:21.60,00:21:21.60,"day I will never, ever forget, like, for the rest of my life."
334,00:21:27.20,00:21:27.20,"Look, they're all wearing our hats and stuff."
335,00:21:30.13,00:21:30.13,>> Bye! Bye!
336,00:21:52.00,00:21:52.00,">> I hadn't told anybody yet that I voted for Lex, and I"
337,00:21:55.83,00:21:55.83,"won't anytime soon. >> Everywhere you turn, a little"
338,00:21:58.77,00:21:58.77,bit of scheming going on. >> It did work well with Lex
339,00:22:03.73,00:22:03.73,gone. So it's allowed us to do things
340,00:22:05.73,00:22:05.73,that I don't think would have happened if he had stayed.
341,00:22:11.10,00:22:11.10,">> This is going to be so much fun, just kind of satisfying."
342,00:22:13.70,00:22:13.70,">> Believe it or not, God bless her, Teresa has apparently"
343,00:22:17.30,00:22:17.30,gathered Kim and Brandon back under the original Samburu
344,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,"wings, two individuals I can't put any trust in, but at this"
345,00:22:24.43,00:22:24.43,"point in the game, I really have not much of a choice."
346,00:22:27.47,00:22:27.47,So I think it'll be a major D-day invasion going on.
347,00:22:31.03,00:22:31.03,">> If we're going to make a move, it has to be this Tribal"
348,00:22:33.57,00:22:33.57,"Council. It has to be, because this is"
349,00:22:35.97,00:22:35.97,our only chance. >> Right.
350,00:22:43.93,00:22:43.93,>> The downside of going on a reward challenge and being away
351,00:22:47.67,00:22:47.67,"for the whole day is, you know, people have a chance to plot"
352,00:22:51.07,00:22:51.07,"against you, say good things about you, bad things about you."
353,00:22:54.20,00:22:54.20,>> I don't see how the rewards can get that much better.
354,00:22:56.87,00:22:56.87,">> I know. >> At this stage of the game,"
355,00:22:58.73,00:22:58.73,you don't want to piss anyone off.
356,00:23:00.40,00:23:00.40,"You know, we didn't want to go there and say, ""Oh, it was the"
357,00:23:02.53,00:23:02.53,"greatest thing ever and you guys didn't get to do it."""
358,00:23:04.63,00:23:04.63,>> Did you have fun? >> We want to hear about it.
359,00:23:07.47,00:23:07.47,Come on in. >> Was it awesome?
360,00:23:08.93,00:23:08.93,>> Was it a lot of fun? >> We wanted to be sensitive to
361,00:23:10.87,00:23:10.87,the fact that it was probably tough for them to be left behind
362,00:23:12.30,00:23:12.30,while we went off and had a really great time and ate a
363,00:23:14.43,00:23:14.43,"bunch of food when they were eating, you know, a tiny portion"
364,00:23:16.57,00:23:16.57,of mush. >> We even got you guys treats.
365,00:23:20.83,00:23:20.83,>> Everyone gets two. >> Oh!
366,00:23:22.73,00:23:22.73,>> Santa Claus. Santa Claus.
367,00:23:24.70,00:23:24.70,>> That tastes like coconut. >> That's very good.
368,00:23:27.00,00:23:27.00,>> I just sucked it out. It was so good.
369,00:23:28.87,00:23:28.87,">> Getting a treat like that out here, particularly something"
370,00:23:31.77,00:23:31.77,"sweet that we've been craving, was just, like, the best gift."
371,00:23:35.80,00:23:35.80,>> 33 cookies each. >> Oh!
372,00:23:38.90,00:23:38.90,">> Oh, my God! >> Did you carry all that back?"
373,00:23:42.40,00:23:42.40,"Oh, my God, thank you so much. >> You are amazing."
374,00:23:44.70,00:23:44.70,>> Thank you. >> Ethan made them look so good.
375,00:23:47.00,00:23:47.00,He deserved every bit of credit he got for bringing those
376,00:23:49.97,00:23:49.97,"cookies back. >> Ethan, we love you so much."
377,00:23:52.50,00:23:52.50,>> Thank you so much. These are fabulous.
378,00:23:54.83,00:23:54.83,>> Mmm. >> These are good.
379,00:24:03.93,00:24:03.93,>> Good? >> That feels great.
380,00:24:05.43,00:24:05.43,"Thank you, Frank. Okay, do you know where you're"
381,00:24:07.33,00:24:07.33,"going? >> Oh, no, my shorts."
382,00:24:10.40,00:24:10.40,">> Okay, this is what I gather. T told me that you're correct."
383,00:24:14.03,00:24:14.03,Lex does think you voted for him.
384,00:24:16.10,00:24:16.10,">> I refuse to spend my time here kissing up to him,"
385,00:24:19.00,00:24:19.00,trying to convince him I didn't vote against him.
386,00:24:20.77,00:24:20.77,>> He might not be around. >> I was trying to work a little
387,00:24:23.10,00:24:23.10,"bit on Kelly, in seeing whether or not she might come and vote"
388,00:24:25.70,00:24:25.70,"with us because she is really kind of upset with Lex, but I"
389,00:24:28.20,00:24:28.20,don't want to push her too hard. So I'm waiting to see what
390,00:24:30.60,00:24:30.60,happens at the immunity challenge.
391,00:24:32.10,00:24:32.10,">> I'm not going to say that would make me sad, but after"
392,00:24:34.13,00:24:34.13,what happened last time I'm kind of gun-shy about...
393,00:24:36.10,00:24:36.10,">> Kim-- she kind of asked me to vote with them, and I said no, I"
394,00:24:38.90,00:24:38.90,"have to vote with my tribe, but, you know, best of luck with your"
395,00:24:41.70,00:24:41.70,little coup and we'll see what happens.
396,00:24:43.43,00:24:43.43,Are you sure Frank's not in on that?
397,00:24:44.87,00:24:44.87,">> Yeah, Frank's definitely in on this."
398,00:24:46.30,00:24:46.30,"Kelly said she wasn't going to vote for Lex, but I think"
399,00:24:48.17,00:24:48.17,there's part of her that does want to vote with us because she
400,00:24:50.40,00:24:50.40,doesn't want Lex to be around. >> That's thinking with your
401,00:24:52.80,00:24:52.80,head. >> Everything lays on the next
402,00:24:55.07,00:24:55.07,"immunity challenge. I mean, if Lex wins it, it's"
403,00:24:57.57,00:24:57.57,kind of back to game over for us.
404,00:24:59.50,00:24:59.50,"So everything lays on that. >> PROBST: How's it going, guys?"
405,00:25:19.13,00:25:19.13,>> Great. >> Good.
406,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,">> PROBST: First things first. Teresa, I hate to take it back,"
407,00:25:23.10,00:25:23.10,but... >> You got to do what you got
408,00:25:24.67,00:25:24.67,to do. >> PROBST: Did you like having
409,00:25:26.20,00:25:26.20,that? >> I loved having it.
410,00:25:27.63,00:25:27.63,>> PROBST: Immunity back up for grabs today.
411,00:25:29.50,00:25:29.50,"For today's challenge, I want you to guys to line up short in"
412,00:25:32.47,00:25:32.47,"front, tall in back. I want to show you something."
413,00:25:34.70,00:25:34.70,Just right behind those rocks. Everybody ready?
414,00:25:36.73,00:25:36.73,You have 30 seconds to study these items.
415,00:25:40.03,00:25:40.03,Carefully memorize the placement of each item.
416,00:25:45.10,00:25:45.10,"Make sure you can see every box. If you can't, move so you can."
417,00:25:50.23,00:25:50.23,"Five, four, three, two, one. Head to your barrels."
418,00:25:56.53,00:25:56.53,Everybody lift the lid off of your barrels.
419,00:25:59.13,00:25:59.13,"Take a look at your grid inside. Think of this like a phone pad,"
420,00:26:03.23,00:26:03.23,going across from left to right is one through nine.
421,00:26:06.83,00:26:06.83,So one is in your upper left-hand corner.
422,00:26:09.37,00:26:09.37,Five is in the middle. Nine is in the bottom right.
423,00:26:12.60,00:26:12.60,"On my start, I'm going to give you an item."
424,00:26:15.30,00:26:15.30,"You need to find that item, come back with it, and get it in the"
425,00:26:18.70,00:26:18.70,right spot in order to move on to the next round.
426,00:26:21.30,00:26:21.30,Everything you need is 150 feet out that way.
427,00:26:24.33,00:26:24.33,"This is for immunity. On my start, we're looking for"
428,00:26:28.77,00:26:28.77,item number seven. Survivors ready?
429,00:26:31.60,00:26:31.60,"Go! All right, Brandon, peel it back"
430,00:26:51.93,00:26:51.93,this way. Let's see what you got.
431,00:26:53.73,00:26:53.73,"You got it, a leaf and a seed pod."
432,00:26:55.53,00:26:55.53,You're good. Peel it back.
433,00:26:58.67,00:26:58.67,"No, that's wrong, Frank. You're done."
434,00:27:02.03,00:27:02.03,You're good. You're good.
435,00:27:09.57,00:27:09.57,"Sorry, Kim. You're missing the leaf."
436,00:27:14.07,00:27:14.07,You're good. You're good.
437,00:27:22.00,00:27:22.00,You're missing the seed pod. You're out.
438,00:27:23.90,00:27:23.90,>> Really? >> PROBST: Yep.
439,00:27:25.37,00:27:25.37,>> Shoot. >> PROBST: You're good.
440,00:27:31.57,00:27:31.57,"Here we go, guys. Next item, number two."
441,00:27:34.47,00:27:34.47,Survivors ready? Go!
442,00:27:48.47,00:27:48.47,"All right, Brandon. That's right, elephant dung."
443,00:27:51.90,00:27:51.90,Nice job. >> Thank you.
444,00:27:53.50,00:27:53.50,">> PROBST: You're still alive. Let's see what you got, Kelly."
445,00:27:57.07,00:27:57.07,"No, it wasn't a rock. >> I know what it was, too."
446,00:28:00.93,00:28:00.93,">> PROBST: Oh, Lex... size does matter."
447,00:28:06.27,00:28:06.27,"No, that's wrong. I'm sorry, Teresa."
448,00:28:09.43,00:28:09.43,"You're out. >> PROBST: Big Tom, you've seen"
449,00:28:12.90,00:28:12.90,"that before. Yep, you're good."
450,00:28:15.00,00:28:15.00,"All right, Ethan. Yep."
451,00:28:18.10,00:28:18.10,"Brandon, Lex, Tom, Ethan, for our final round, I have a whole"
452,00:28:21.67,00:28:21.67,"new barrel of items. I want you to come in close,"
453,00:28:24.87,00:28:24.87,take a look. You guys have 15 seconds to
454,00:28:27.70,00:28:27.70,"study these items. Five, four, three, two, one."
455,00:28:36.77,00:28:36.77,"Head back to your barrels. Okay, guys, on my start, you"
456,00:28:40.43,00:28:40.43,have exactly one minute to find as many of the items as you can.
457,00:28:44.53,00:28:44.53,The person back with the most items wins immunity and cannot
458,00:28:47.60,00:28:47.60,be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council.
459,00:28:49.73,00:28:49.73,Survivors ready? Go!
460,00:28:51.87,00:28:51.87,"You have one minute. You want to grab some, put them"
461,00:28:56.53,00:28:56.53,"in and go back out, you can. Shove them in your pocket."
462,00:28:59.30,00:28:59.30,"Whatever works. For immunity, guys."
463,00:29:02.77,00:29:02.77,Pick it up. 30 seconds.
464,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,"You'd better hustle, Brandon. If you got them, get them in."
465,00:29:08.17,00:29:08.17,"Hurry up, Big Tom. Start wrapping it up."
466,00:29:10.93,00:29:10.93,"Ten seconds. Five, four, three..."
467,00:29:14.13,00:29:14.13,"get it in the barrel... two, one."
468,00:29:17.47,00:29:17.47,"That's it, you're done. All right, Brandon, open that"
469,00:29:20.23,00:29:20.23,baby up. Let's see what you got here.
470,00:29:22.67,00:29:22.67,"You got one, two... you got three, four..."
471,00:29:26.67,00:29:26.67,You got five. Brandon has six.
472,00:29:29.50,00:29:29.50,Six is the number to beat. You got two.
473,00:29:34.63,00:29:34.63,You got three. You got four.
474,00:29:37.33,00:29:37.33,"You got five. Sorry, Lex."
475,00:29:41.23,00:29:41.23,Brandon's still the number to beat with six.
476,00:29:43.70,00:29:43.70,"Big Tom, you got one, two, three four, five, six."
477,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.20,This is not right. You're still alive with six.
478,00:29:51.90,00:29:51.90,"Big Tom and Brandon at six. Ethan, you have one, two, three,"
479,00:29:59.80,00:29:59.80,"four, five, six, seven and eight."
480,00:30:04.10,00:30:04.10,>> Nice! >> Ethan wins immunity.
481,00:30:07.30,00:30:07.30,"Congratulations. >> Good job, Ethan."
482,00:30:11.27,00:30:11.27,">> PROBST: It's yours, buddy. Nice job."
483,00:30:13.40,00:30:13.40,Congratulations. >> Thank you.
484,00:30:14.90,00:30:14.90,>> PROBST: You cannot be voted out at tonight's Tribal Council.
485,00:30:17.13,00:30:17.13,The rest of you guys have the afternoon to think about it.
486,00:30:19.80,00:30:19.80,I'll see you tonight for another vote.
487,00:30:48.07,00:30:48.07,>> Don't worry about it. >> Please.
488,00:30:49.53,00:30:49.53,>> Don't worry about it. >> All right.
489,00:30:51.03,00:30:51.03,"The last three days, since our last Tribal Council, have been"
490,00:30:54.43,00:30:54.43,"pretty interesting. There was that mystery vote, and"
491,00:30:57.23,00:30:57.23,my goal was in three days to figure out who it was that cast
492,00:31:00.43,00:31:00.43,that vote. After putting two and two
493,00:31:05.83,00:31:05.83,"together, gathering a lot of information, kind of observing"
494,00:31:09.40,00:31:09.40,"things, it became really evident that my worst fears were more"
495,00:31:14.30,00:31:14.30,and more likely than not were true.
496,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,>> Tom? >> Yeah.
497,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,">> Hey, I had a shift with Brandon this morning."
498,00:31:19.97,00:31:19.97,>> Yeah? >> And he heard Kelly talking to
499,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,Frank and T-bird and he distinctly heard her say the
500,00:31:26.43,00:31:26.43,"words ""free agent."" >> Free agent."
501,00:31:29.10,00:31:29.10,">> Yeah, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind now that"
502,00:31:33.33,00:31:33.33,Kelly's turning. >> That she's the rat?
503,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,We're shooting a harpoon shot that it's Kelly.
504,00:31:38.90,00:31:38.90,"It's hard for me to go against my tribe mate, and I like little"
505,00:31:43.30,00:31:43.30,"Kelly, but all indications is it's her."
506,00:31:45.70,00:31:45.70,But we really haven't gotten anything concrete on that.
507,00:31:49.13,00:31:49.13,">> So I talked to Brandon. I said, ""Look, I would like you"
508,00:31:52.77,00:31:52.77,to take Kelly's spot as our fifth member.
509,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,"You will be the fifth one from the top."""
510,00:31:58.30,00:31:58.30,"My gut tells me, without doubt, that I can trust him."
511,00:32:03.83,00:32:03.83,"You know my gut is good. >> Right, so far it's been"
512,00:32:07.10,00:32:07.10,pretty good. Lex is putting his trust in
513,00:32:09.27,00:32:09.27,Brandon. I didn't really get to
514,00:32:11.33,00:32:11.33,interrogate Kelly enough to make sure she's that rat.
515,00:32:14.33,00:32:14.33,"Everything points to her, but I will feel like hell if we have"
516,00:32:18.77,00:32:18.77,kicked one of our own team members off over Lex's gut
517,00:32:23.30,00:32:23.30,"feeling. All right, well, then how will"
518,00:32:26.60,00:32:26.60,the vote go? How will we do it?
519,00:32:29.23,00:32:29.23,">> Me, you, Ethan... >> Kim, Johnson and Brandon,"
520,00:32:34.43,00:32:34.43,five. So I say we cut Kelly off
521,00:32:37.37,00:32:37.37,tonight. It all fits.
522,00:32:39.60,00:32:39.60,That's why we have to take her out tonight.
523,00:32:41.30,00:32:41.30,">> If his gut feeling ain't right, we've done Kelly an"
524,00:32:44.13,00:32:44.13,injustice and we've done ourself an injustice.
525,00:32:46.60,00:32:46.60,>> Are you sure? >> I'm sure.
526,00:32:59.07,00:32:59.07,">> Ever since the immunity challenge, things have been very"
527,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,"different, different than they've ever been before."
528,00:33:04.93,00:33:04.93,Lex hasn't been laying down the orders of who I'm supposed to
529,00:33:07.50,00:33:07.50,"vote for, who we're supposed to vote for, so I have no clue"
530,00:33:09.97,00:33:09.97,really what's going on. >> You want to know what's going
531,00:33:12.73,00:33:12.73,"on? >> Well, yeah."
532,00:33:14.23,00:33:14.23,">> Well, we've kind of... we've hit an impasse."
533,00:33:17.30,00:33:17.30,>> I can tell. >> I've made a commitment to
534,00:33:19.73,00:33:19.73,"myself to try to... that by the time the third day came, I was"
535,00:33:22.93,00:33:22.93,"going to try to sniff out the rat and whoever that was, that's"
536,00:33:26.17,00:33:26.17,"who would get my vote. Now, if that means that we're,"
537,00:33:29.77,00:33:29.77,"that we're splintering at this point, so be it."
538,00:33:33.50,00:33:33.50,"But I... you know, it doesn't seem that alliances are what"
539,00:33:36.87,00:33:36.87,they used to be. >> I don't know.
540,00:33:38.70,00:33:38.70,"I thought, you know... I mean, whatever."
541,00:33:40.83,00:33:40.83,If everyone's made up their mind then that's fine.
542,00:33:43.53,00:33:43.53,"The whole thing about the vote against you wasn't me, so if"
543,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,"that would be anyone's reason to vote against me, I would really"
544,00:33:50.20,00:33:50.20,hope there was more to it than that.
545,00:33:52.27,00:33:52.27,>> It's going to be what it's going to be.
546,00:33:55.03,00:33:55.03,So... >> All right.
547,00:33:56.63,00:33:56.63,>> Okay? >> My butt is on the line
548,00:33:58.50,00:33:58.50,"because, you know, my own teammates are all trying to turn"
549,00:34:01.27,00:34:01.27,"against me, and I'm just, like, ""This is ridiculous."""
550,00:34:03.73,00:34:03.73,I feel like my only real strategy is to try to defect and
551,00:34:07.53,00:34:07.53,team up with the four from Samburu.
552,00:34:09.80,00:34:09.80,">> Are you okay? >> Oh, I'm fine."
553,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,I don't even know what's going on.
554,00:34:12.80,00:34:12.80,"They're just like, ""We don't want to have an alliance"
555,00:34:14.47,00:34:14.47,"anymore."" Everyone wants to vote for"
556,00:34:16.10,00:34:16.10,"different people. Okay, then we can all vote our"
557,00:34:17.60,00:34:17.60,"own way. >> That's fine, I mean."
558,00:34:19.07,00:34:19.07,">> Then I'll vote for Lex. >> I'll vote for Lex, too."
559,00:34:20.83,00:34:20.83,>> You have my word. I'll vote for Lex.
560,00:34:22.23,00:34:22.23,">> If I change for any reason, I will come and let you know."
561,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"But I'll try and work on T-bird. All right, I'll let you know."
562,00:34:27.67,00:34:27.67,">> We've got Kelly. I don't know that I trust Kelly,"
563,00:34:32.10,00:34:32.10,"but at this point, I don't have a choice not to."
564,00:34:34.40,00:34:34.40,She's our only hope. >> Are you sure?
565,00:34:36.93,00:34:36.93,>> I'm positive. I'm positive.
566,00:34:41.63,00:34:41.63,>> You don't want to go with Kelly.
567,00:34:43.80,00:34:43.80,"You don't trust her long-term, do you?"
568,00:34:45.80,00:34:45.80,>> Yes. >> Are you sure?
569,00:34:47.43,00:34:47.43,>> Positive. >> We have to get Lex out
570,00:34:49.67,00:34:49.67,"because it's Kelly, me, Brandon, you Frank, you know, gone."
571,00:34:53.10,00:34:53.10,">> If we don't all do it, it's not going to work."
572,00:34:56.37,00:34:56.37,It won't work. >> I know.
573,00:34:58.70,00:34:58.70,I know. >> Brandon's absolutely sure?
574,00:35:03.77,00:35:03.77,">> He's definitely in. If it changes, I will let you"
575,00:35:07.13,00:35:07.13,know. >> Man.
576,00:35:13.67,00:35:13.67,"I can trust you, right? >> Yes."
577,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,">> Yeah, I know that. >> My old team is looking for me"
578,00:35:27.03,00:35:27.03,"to do what we talked about yesterday, which is vote"
579,00:35:28.83,00:35:28.83,"for Lex. But then again, Lex flat out"
580,00:35:30.63,00:35:30.63,told me this morning that they wanted me to vote Kelly off
581,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,tonight. Now I'm feeling like I'm in a
582,00:35:34.97,00:35:34.97,power play position and that wasn't what I had planned and
583,00:35:37.27,00:35:37.27,it's very awkward for me and I don't know what I'm
584,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,going to do yet. I honestly don't know.
585,00:36:18.80,00:36:18.80,>> PROBST: Welcome. Looking forward to another good
586,00:36:21.60,00:36:21.60,Tribal Council. Ethan...
587,00:36:23.00,00:36:23.00,>> Yeah? >> PROBST: This is sort of your
588,00:36:24.50,00:36:24.50,"week. >> Yeah, it happened to be a"
589,00:36:26.07,00:36:26.07,good week for me. >> PROBST: You're dominating
590,00:36:27.87,00:36:27.87,everything. Let's talk about the reward.
591,00:36:29.87,00:36:29.87,"A scale of one to ten, how good of an experience was that?"
592,00:36:32.50,00:36:32.50,">> It was a ten, for sure, one of the best days of my life."
593,00:36:36.00,00:36:36.00,And a day I'll never forget and no one can take that away from
594,00:36:38.93,00:36:38.93,"me, no matter what happens in the game."
595,00:36:40.83,00:36:40.83,">> PROBST: Tom, what does go on when two people leave?"
596,00:36:43.77,00:36:43.77,What kind of a void does that create?
597,00:36:45.70,00:36:45.70,">> There's more talking, you know, among different people."
598,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,"The circles are not as tight, and it was a day that everybody"
599,00:36:54.03,00:36:54.03,"was running around like a chicken with their head cut off,"
600,00:36:57.73,00:36:57.73,talking to everybody. And so I didn't know what to
601,00:37:00.67,00:37:00.67,think. So it was definitely different.
602,00:37:02.80,00:37:02.80,">> PROBST: Kim, did the thought occur to you, you know, what,"
603,00:37:05.67,00:37:05.67,"maybe I don't want to go on a reward because as Tom said,"
604,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,there's a lot of talking that goes on at camp.
605,00:37:10.53,00:37:10.53,"Maybe that's more important, to be there?"
606,00:37:13.10,00:37:13.10,">> Yeah, you know, you do think about it."
607,00:37:14.97,00:37:14.97,But I don't think that anybody really would say that they'd
608,00:37:17.43,00:37:17.43,"want to give up a reward and just stay there and see, you"
609,00:37:19.77,00:37:19.77,"know, what was going on in camp life."
610,00:37:21.50,00:37:21.50,"I mean, it's so important to us to win rewards and it's such a"
611,00:37:23.80,00:37:23.80,great experience. What they did was so amazing.
612,00:37:26.10,00:37:26.10,"It's not, it's not like you would miss that much in camp"
613,00:37:28.80,00:37:28.80,life. >> PROBST: Let's talk about last
614,00:37:30.57,00:37:30.57,"week's vote. Lex, surprised to get votes?"
615,00:37:34.20,00:37:34.20,">> I was pretty surprised to get a couple of votes, and it was"
616,00:37:37.03,00:37:37.03,"definitely something that occupied a lot of my, a lot of"
617,00:37:39.63,00:37:39.63,my thoughts the last three days. >> PROBST: Why were you
618,00:37:42.07,00:37:42.07,surprised? Because normally when I ask you
619,00:37:44.30,00:37:44.30,"guys, everybody says, ""Oh, I really feel vulnerable tonight."
620,00:37:47.03,00:37:47.03,"It certainly could be my night."" And yet when you get a vote,"
621,00:37:49.60,00:37:49.60,"it's like, ""Who the hell voted for me?"""
622,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,">> Well, I think that's just a natural reaction."
623,00:37:53.53,00:37:53.53,"Everybody feels vulnerable here, but that doesn't mean that you"
624,00:37:56.50,00:37:56.50,expect to get votes. And yet when you see your name
625,00:37:59.43,00:37:59.43,"on one of those little cards, I mean, it changes everything."
626,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"It's hard. But yeah, the burning question"
627,00:38:06.70,00:38:06.70,"was: ""Who wrote my name down on the paper?"""
628,00:38:10.03,00:38:10.03,">> PROBST: Well, you guys have made it a long ways."
629,00:38:12.80,00:38:12.80,"24 days, you're down to a one-in-nine shot at a million"
630,00:38:15.77,00:38:15.77,bucks at this point. Let's find out who's out of the
631,00:38:18.57,00:38:18.57,game. It's time to vote.
632,00:38:20.30,00:38:20.30,"Lex, you're up first. >> Kelly, if I'm wrong about"
633,00:38:33.67,00:38:33.67,"you, then I apologize, but I smell a rat, and my gut tells me"
634,00:38:38.13,00:38:38.13,"that you stabbed me in the back, and you're playing both sides."
635,00:38:41.97,00:38:41.97,"And if that's the case, then good riddance."
636,00:38:57.37,00:38:57.37,">> When it's me, you'll know it. I couldn't be more excited to be"
637,00:39:01.80,00:39:01.80,"casting this vote. I never wanted you to win, and"
638,00:39:04.70,00:39:04.70,"now I hope you won't. If this is the last vote I cast,"
639,00:39:07.43,00:39:07.43,"then at least I got a vote for you, who I've always found to be"
640,00:39:10.33,00:39:10.33,not fun to be around. >> This is a kicker.
641,00:39:40.03,00:39:40.03,"I made a promise to Lex that I would vote this way tonight, and"
642,00:39:43.93,00:39:43.93,"I'm probably going to bite it, but I really am doing it to make"
643,00:39:48.23,00:39:48.23,"it to the final four at least. So, um, sorry, Kelly."
644,00:39:55.40,00:39:55.40,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
645,00:40:10.00,00:40:10.00,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
646,00:40:12.20,00:40:12.20,The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
647,00:40:14.53,00:40:14.53,"immediately. Before I get to the vote, I just"
648,00:40:16.60,00:40:16.60,"want to remind you guys that, beginning tonight, the person"
649,00:40:19.10,00:40:19.10,voted out of the tribe does not leave the game.
650,00:40:21.10,00:40:21.10,They will return and be a part of the jury and will have a huge
651,00:40:24.20,00:40:24.20,impact on the outcome. You're about to vote somebody
652,00:40:27.33,00:40:27.33,out of this game and then ask them to vote for you to win.
653,00:40:31.40,00:40:31.40,I'll read the votes. First vote: Kelly.
654,00:40:44.00,00:40:44.00,Kelly. Lex.
655,00:40:56.43,00:40:56.43,Lex. Two votes: Lex;
656,00:40:58.43,00:40:58.43,two votes: Kelly. Lex.
657,00:41:07.13,00:41:07.13,Kelly. Three votes Lex;
658,00:41:09.80,00:41:09.80,three votes Kelly. It's four votes Lex.
659,00:41:19.13,00:41:19.13,"Four votes Kelly. We're tied, four votes each."
660,00:41:24.07,00:41:24.07,Lex and Kelly. The last vote.
661,00:41:29.60,00:41:29.60,"Kelly. >> Oh, no."
662,00:41:31.30,00:41:31.30,>> PROBST: You need to bring me your torch.
663,00:41:33.87,00:41:33.87,>> All right. >> Live it up.
664,00:41:48.10,00:41:48.10,">> PROBST: Kelly, the tribe has spoken."
665,00:41:54.70,00:41:54.70,It's time for you to go. I don't have much to say.
666,00:42:10.27,00:42:10.27,I think Kelly's reaction said it all.
667,00:42:12.33,00:42:12.33,You guys can head back to camp. We'll see you tomorrow.
668,00:42:31.43,00:42:31.43,Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
669,00:42:34.67,00:42:34.67,>> PROBST: Next time on  Survivor: Tom's body starts
670,00:42:37.00,00:42:37.00,"to rebel. >> Oh, my golly, gee."
671,00:42:38.83,00:42:38.83,>> Tom's got a third eye. >> PROBST: Brandon's in the
672,00:42:41.50,00:42:41.50,"doghouse. >> I was set up, but by somebody"
673,00:42:44.00,00:42:44.00,I thought was my friend. >> PROBST: And Lex's loyalty is
674,00:42:46.87,00:42:46.87,questioned. >> And Lex is beginning to give
675,00:42:50.17,00:42:50.17,"us the shake, you know. >> Last night we had to do"
676,00:42:52.37,00:42:52.37,something to save our ass. I acted and I'm regretting it
677,00:42:54.37,00:42:54.37,"now. >> I love you, Mom and Dad."
678,00:43:02.80,00:43:02.80,"I can't help but be myself, and I've never been too good at"
679,00:43:06.33,00:43:06.33,sticking to one clique. I always kind of float around.
680,00:43:08.80,00:43:08.80,"It was hard for me not to have friends in different places,"
681,00:43:11.07,00:43:11.07,"and that kind of screwed me, but hey, I made it past the hard"
682,00:43:13.40,00:43:13.40,"part with the boulders and whatnot, and for a skinny girl,"
683,00:43:15.57,00:43:15.57,"that's kind of, you know, it's a big deal."
684,00:43:17.27,00:43:17.27,I had a lot of fun.
