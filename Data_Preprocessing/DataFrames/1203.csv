83,00:04:44.08,00:04:44.08,"accurate.I mean, we just went for it."
84,00:04:47.00,00:04:47.00,">> Oh, listen to that beautifulsound."
85,00:04:49.50,00:04:49.50,We missed a lot but that's okay.>> So you really think...

87,00:04:55.54,00:04:55.54,I'm shocked and awed that thismethod actually gets bacteria
88,00:04:58.12,00:04:58.12,"out of the water.>> It won't get all of it out,"
89,00:05:00.54,00:05:00.54,"but...>> Yeah, it won't."
90,00:05:03.17,00:05:03.17,">> Bruce told us about hisfiltration method, which he said"
91,00:05:05.71,00:05:05.71,"makes the water 90% pure.And he was drinking it, and he"
92,00:05:08.38,00:05:08.38,was fine-- he survived.So we're a lot more powerful
93,00:05:11.71,00:05:11.71,as a tribe with him in Melinda'splace than we were.
94,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,">> Okay. Now I watch out foryou, right?"
95,00:05:17.17,00:05:17.17,">> Yes, Bruce.>> The tribe reacted to me with"
96,00:05:19.71,00:05:19.71,great joy.They thought I was a gift from
97,00:05:21.75,00:05:21.75,heaven.They were just very ecstatic
98,00:05:24.71,00:05:24.71,that I was there.This is the best bottle so far.
99,00:05:28.17,00:05:28.17,I know that I was the last manpicked.
100,00:05:32.17,00:05:32.17,Now I'm emerging as the top ofthe tribe.
101,00:05:53.58,00:05:53.58,">> Hey, guys, are we doingshells and everything?"
102,00:05:57.17,00:05:57.17,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah.>> We've been eating very"
103,00:06:03.08,00:06:03.08,little.Some stew made out of snails and
104,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,"crab legs, but nothing much tospeak of."
105,00:06:12.00,00:06:12.00,>> So any gooey part's okay?>> I'm eating all of it.
106,00:06:16.58,00:06:16.58,">> Is there water?Here, here's water."
107,00:06:20.04,00:06:20.04,">> Oh, yeah.I'm not doing snails."
108,00:06:24.21,00:06:24.21,>> We're just slowly goingdownhill.

110,00:06:30.29,00:06:30.29,"going to be in around here.Right now, I mean if we could"
111,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,"catch a few fish a day, even twofish a day, we'd be a in a whole"
112,00:06:35.54,00:06:35.54,other ballgame.The equipment that we have
113,00:06:44.00,00:06:44.00,"for fishing is very old-school,very medieval, and the knowledge"
114,00:06:48.62,00:06:48.62,on our part is as minimal as itcould be.
115,00:06:53.08,00:06:53.08,He's on. He's on...He's on.
116,00:06:57.12,00:06:57.12,"Aw, shoot!Oh!"
117,00:07:00.08,00:07:00.08,">> Aw, no!>> That damn spear that Sally"
118,00:07:04.17,00:07:04.17,"lost-- God, what we wouldn'tgive to have that thing back."
119,00:07:07.04,00:07:07.04,How did you lose that spear?>> Yee-ha!
120,00:07:18.33,00:07:18.33,"Oh, he's a nice one.There we are, boys."
121,00:07:22.96,00:07:22.96,It's fish.It's a puffer thing.
122,00:07:27.08,00:07:27.08,"It's kind of freaky.That is a freaky, freaky thing."
123,00:07:32.71,00:07:32.71,"Right around camp, the fishpopulation seems to consist of"
124,00:07:35.62,00:07:35.62,"nothing but poisonous pufferfish, which we've caught in"
125,00:07:37.96,00:07:37.96,droves.So it's not like we're
126,00:07:40.79,00:07:40.79,not catching fish; we're justcatching the ones we can't eat.
127,00:07:44.33,00:07:44.33,"To spend two or three hours outthere, when you could be doing"
128,00:07:46.54,00:07:46.54,"things around camp to helpeverybody, and you, like, come"

131,00:07:55.88,00:07:55.88,"Hey, that's a good little fatfish."
132,00:07:58.04,00:07:58.04,">> Good job.>> Oh, thanks."
133,00:08:00.29,00:08:00.29,">> Terry, the sole provider ofthis tribe came up with Nemo--"

137,00:08:15.54,00:08:15.54,"how to talk about it.>> Come on, mama."
138,00:08:18.54,00:08:18.54,">> Oh, you can feel the meat inhere."
139,00:08:20.08,00:08:20.08,>> Mmm.There was a lot of meat on that
140,00:08:22.29,00:08:22.29,"little guy, or maybe it justfelt like a lot because we"
141,00:08:24.21,00:08:24.21,haven't had meat in so long.If we can catch a couple more of
142,00:08:27.88,00:08:27.88,"those every day, that would justbe unbelievable."
143,00:08:31.04,00:08:31.04,>> Potato on that.>> Yeah.

156,00:09:23.17,00:09:23.17,"us, because he was willing totake the lead on everything."

563,00:34:38.62,00:34:38.62,to be in this game because ofthe way that I'm aligned.
564,00:35:00.12,00:35:00.12,">> PROBST: For those of you whodon't have torches, grab a"
565,00:35:03.38,00:35:03.38,"torch, approach the flame, dipyour torch in, and get fire."
566,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,This is part of the ritual atTribal Council because in this

568,00:35:15.88,00:35:15.88,"you're in the game.When your fire is gone, so are"

573,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,"On the mental side, not thereyet, I'm sure it will be."
574,00:35:35.83,00:35:35.83,And I'm ready for what comesdown the road.

577,00:35:42.83,00:35:42.83,"involved, and it's difficult togo many, many days without"
578,00:35:47.12,00:35:47.12,"food, but the companionship isexcellent."
579,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,For strangers to come togetherand work together so well so
580,00:35:52.21,00:35:52.21,"fast, that's impressive.>> PROBST: Sally, how about the"
581,00:35:57.25,00:35:57.25,first eight days for you?>> The first eight days for me
582,00:36:00.33,00:36:00.33,have been everything I thoughtthey could be.
583,00:36:04.17,00:36:04.17,Other than the fact that Ididn't think I would come in
584,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,here and actually care aboutthese people as much as I could
585,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"in eight days.>> PROBST: Austin, what's the"
586,00:36:11.62,00:36:11.62,"food situation?>> The X factor, Terry caught a"
587,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,fish yesterday that was nobigger than this.
588,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,"But, man, when you haven't hadany protein in days, that will"
589,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,do wonders for you.I am by no means a strong
590,00:36:23.33,00:36:23.33,"fisherman, and all we can catchare the puffer fish, which,"
591,00:36:25.96,00:36:25.96,those things are poisonous.So we just hadn't had any luck
592,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,"Jeff, it sucks.>> PROBST: Well, what are you"
593,00:36:31.25,00:36:31.25,doing with the spear?>> We had a little incident with

599,00:36:47.79,00:36:47.79,"from the women that, ""We haveto live up to this""?"
600,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,>> I think in any situationwhen you've got a mixed group
601,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,"like this, there's always apressure that we've got to step"
602,00:36:56.33,00:36:56.33,up to the plate and play justas well as the men are.
603,00:36:59.12,00:36:59.12,>> PROBST: Do you truly thinkall seven people here are all

606,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,expect coming into this game.I expected to have the little
607,00:37:10.25,00:37:10.25,"sects of people, you know,trying to pretend to pull"
608,00:37:14.08,00:37:14.08,"together and make a team out ofit, but we don't have that"
609,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,"issue, we really are a team.>> PROBST: So, Terry, if you"
610,00:37:20.04,00:37:20.04,"really are this unified, how doyou make a vote tonight?"
611,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,Are people coming here andmaking individual votes and
612,00:37:27.25,00:37:27.25,"we'll just see what happens?>> Obviously, there's been some"
613,00:37:30.00,00:37:30.00,talk.It's all part of the game to
614,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,"talk to different people onwhat their feeling is, and we"
615,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,all understand that someone hasto go tonight.

619,00:37:46.92,00:37:46.92,"Jeff, yeah, um...I'm definitely the odd man out."
620,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,And it's a... it's a vulnerableseat to be in tonight.
621,00:37:55.88,00:37:55.88,">> PROBST: How about for you,Nick?"
622,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,Are you basing your vote onwhat you think?
623,00:38:00.62,00:38:00.62,You basing it on a group?>> I'm basing my vote on
624,00:38:03.71,00:38:03.71,probably more... with a grouptonight.

632,00:38:29.67,00:38:29.67,"you found the idol.Otherwise, it remains a mystery."
633,00:38:33.33,00:38:33.33,"Okay, it is time to vote.Austin, you're up."
634,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,>> This is just team play.That's all.
