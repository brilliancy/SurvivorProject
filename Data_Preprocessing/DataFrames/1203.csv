4,00:00:08.21,00:00:08.21,>> There's no reason for me to be doing this.

6,00:00:13.42,00:00:13.42,the four tribes became two-- La Mina and Casaya.

8,00:00:20.83,00:00:20.83,unexpected twist was revealed. You are the only
9,00:00:24.12,00:00:24.12,person guaranteed to be safe at the next Tribal Council.
10,00:00:27.75,00:00:27.75,">> Yeah! Thank you! >> PROBST: Well, go."
11,00:00:30.04,00:00:30.04,Boat's out there. Then the two tribes competed for
12,00:00:32.96,00:00:32.96,fishing gear. Survivors ready!
13,00:00:35.29,00:00:35.29,"Go! In a tough physical challenge,"
14,00:00:38.08,00:00:38.08,Nick helped carry La Mina to victory.
15,00:00:40.96,00:00:40.96,La Mina wins reward! When the new Casaya tribe
16,00:00:44.62,00:00:44.62,"reached their beach, Shane wasted no time."
17,00:00:47.75,00:00:47.75,">> Let's just the four of us, go to the four-- done!"
18,00:00:49.79,00:00:49.79,"Shane, Courtney, Danielle and Aras formed an alliance of four."
19,00:00:54.46,00:00:54.46,">> The people that don't talk and communicate, they're the"
20,00:00:56.12,00:00:56.12,ones that get voted off. >> PROBST: At La Mina...

22,00:01:01.75,00:01:01.75,were torn between the older men and the younger women.
23,00:01:04.62,00:01:04.62,">> We were thinking, if the four of us stuck together, we would"
24,00:01:06.71,00:01:06.71,have the numbers. >> We are right in the middle of
25,00:01:09.17,00:01:09.17,a tug-of-war. Somebody's gonna have to get
26,00:01:11.04,00:01:11.04,hurt out here. >> PROBST: And Sally lost the
27,00:01:13.29,00:01:13.29,tribe's new spear. >> I have some bad news: I lost
28,00:01:16.46,00:01:16.46,"that spear. >> PROBST: On Exile Island,"
29,00:01:20.08,00:01:20.08,Bruce toughed it out. (karate yell)
30,00:01:22.46,00:01:22.46,"(thunder crashes) >> This place is horrible, evil."
31,00:01:25.17,00:01:25.17,I would not wish this on my worst enemy.
32,00:01:28.62,00:01:28.62,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Terry lead La Mina to"
33,00:01:31.46,00:01:31.46,victory. Terry-- pulling that anchor in!
34,00:01:34.33,00:01:34.33,"La Mina wins immunity. Back at Casaya, Shane made a"
35,00:01:38.92,00:01:38.92,"startling announcement. >> Hey, what are you doing?"
36,00:01:45.08,00:01:45.08,">> If somebody wants to quit, let 'em quit!"
37,00:01:48.29,00:01:48.29,">> PROBST: But at the last minute, Aras managed to change"
38,00:01:51.00,00:01:51.00,"Shane's mind... >> Just try it, okay?"
39,00:01:53.92,00:01:53.92,>> Okay. All right. >> PROBST: ...and the focus
40,00:01:56.08,00:01:56.08,shifted to Cirie and Melinda. >> I don't care which one of you
41,00:01:58.25,00:01:58.25,"goes, like whoever doesn't go now, is going next."
42,00:02:02.92,00:02:02.92,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Bruce returned from Exile Island"
43,00:02:05.92,00:02:05.92,and listened in as Casaya's emotions ran high.
44,00:02:09.88,00:02:09.88,>> I was done; I wanted out of here.
45,00:02:12.08,00:02:12.08,"It's some kind of psychotic, bad idea."
46,00:02:15.46,00:02:15.46,">> It bothers me when somebody, even remotely, had the"
47,00:02:17.62,00:02:17.62,"thought to quit, and you have me here trying my best to stay."
48,00:02:22.33,00:02:22.33,">> PROBST: Despite her pleas, Melinda was the first person"

55,00:03:08.12,00:03:08.12,">> Bruce, welcome. >> Oh, thank you."
56,00:03:09.83,00:03:09.83,">> At Tribal Council, we voted off Melinda, and Bruce, who had"
57,00:03:12.54,00:03:12.54,been sent to Exile Island came back and was inserted into
58,00:03:15.25,00:03:15.25,Melinda's place in our tribe at the end of Tribal Council.
59,00:03:21.33,00:03:21.33,">> Oh, it's close. >> You don't need fire right"
60,00:03:25.12,00:03:25.12,now. You want water or you want fire?
61,00:03:27.29,00:03:27.29,"You want water. >> Okay, you have a pot full of"
62,00:03:30.25,00:03:30.25,"water, or bottles filled with old water..."
63,00:03:33.58,00:03:33.58,"When I arrived tonight, I saw my new tribe, and I can see they"
64,00:03:36.58,00:03:36.58,"all had good hearts and fought to get here, but they're all"
65,00:03:40.25,00:03:40.25,tired and lack of water. They didn't have fire.
66,00:03:43.92,00:03:43.92,They really needed all my skills and knowledge.
67,00:03:47.21,00:03:47.21,>> We just thought we were making a fire so we could boil
68,00:03:49.21,00:03:49.21,"the water, and we're gonna drink the  water."
69,00:03:50.62,00:03:50.62,">> No, you don't need to. >> What do you mean?"
70,00:03:57.21,00:03:57.21,>> So this is what we're gonna do: I need a...
71,00:04:01.42,00:04:01.42,"I've been teaching high school, 34 years, karate 40 years, and"
72,00:04:05.42,00:04:05.42,taught backpacking for 19.  I know how to deal with
73,00:04:08.25,00:04:08.25,"different kinds of profiles of people, and there are some..."
74,00:04:12.21,00:04:12.21,"six different profiles right here, let me tell you."
75,00:04:15.00,00:04:15.00,"We're going to filter water through three T-shirts,"
76,00:04:17.08,00:04:17.08,double-layer. It's going to be 90% pure water.
77,00:04:21.17,00:04:21.17,">> Bruce is incredibly neurotic. You know, anytime anyone brings"
78,00:04:25.21,00:04:25.21,"something up, Bruce has been doing it for 25 years and is"
79,00:04:28.21,00:04:28.21,"certified and a teacher. I mean, of course, it grates on"
80,00:04:31.08,00:04:31.08,my nerves-- I just want him to shut up.
81,00:04:33.17,00:04:33.17,"But it's like I... you know, I gotta just let him do his thing."
82,00:04:39.25,00:04:39.25,>> Bruce came through with this filtering system that somehow we
83,00:04:42.42,00:04:42.42,all just believed. I don't even know if it's
84,00:04:44.08,00:04:44.08,"accurate. I mean, we just went for it."
85,00:04:47.00,00:04:47.00,">> Oh, listen to that beautiful sound."
86,00:04:49.50,00:04:49.50,We missed a lot but that's okay. >> So you really think...
87,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,"I mean, I have to tell you, I've also worked in wilderness and"
88,00:04:55.54,00:04:55.54,I'm shocked and awed that this method actually gets bacteria
89,00:04:58.12,00:04:58.12,"out of the water. >> It won't get all of it out,"
90,00:05:00.54,00:05:00.54,"but... >> Yeah, it won't."
91,00:05:03.17,00:05:03.17,">> Bruce told us about his filtration method, which he said"
92,00:05:05.71,00:05:05.71,"makes the water 90% pure. And he was drinking it, and he"
93,00:05:08.38,00:05:08.38,was fine-- he survived. So we're a lot more powerful
94,00:05:11.71,00:05:11.71,as a tribe with him in Melinda's place than we were.
95,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,">> Okay. Now I watch out for you, right?"
96,00:05:17.17,00:05:17.17,">> Yes, Bruce. >> The tribe reacted to me with"
97,00:05:19.71,00:05:19.71,great joy. They thought I was a gift from
98,00:05:21.75,00:05:21.75,heaven. They were just very ecstatic
99,00:05:24.71,00:05:24.71,that I was there. This is the best bottle so far.
100,00:05:28.17,00:05:28.17,I know that I was the last man picked.
101,00:05:32.17,00:05:32.17,Now I'm emerging as the top of the tribe.
102,00:05:53.58,00:05:53.58,">> Hey, guys, are we doing shells and everything?"
103,00:05:57.17,00:05:57.17,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah. >> We've been eating very"
104,00:06:03.08,00:06:03.08,little. Some stew made out of snails and
105,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,"crab legs, but nothing much to speak of."
106,00:06:12.00,00:06:12.00,>> So any gooey part's okay? >> I'm eating all of it.
107,00:06:16.58,00:06:16.58,">> Is there water? Here, here's water."
108,00:06:20.04,00:06:20.04,">> Oh, yeah. I'm not doing snails."
109,00:06:24.21,00:06:24.21,>> We're just slowly going downhill.
110,00:06:27.29,00:06:27.29,"Another day or two, I don't know what kind of shape people are"
111,00:06:30.29,00:06:30.29,"going to be in around here. Right now, I mean if we could"
112,00:06:33.67,00:06:33.67,"catch a few fish a day, even two fish a day, we'd be a in a whole"
113,00:06:35.54,00:06:35.54,other ballgame. The equipment that we have
114,00:06:44.00,00:06:44.00,"for fishing is very old-school, very medieval, and the knowledge"
115,00:06:48.62,00:06:48.62,on our part is as minimal as it could be.
116,00:06:53.08,00:06:53.08,He's on. He's on... He's on.
117,00:06:57.12,00:06:57.12,"Aw, shoot! Oh!"
118,00:07:00.08,00:07:00.08,">> Aw, no! >> That damn spear that Sally"
119,00:07:04.17,00:07:04.17,"lost-- God, what we wouldn't give to have that thing back."
120,00:07:07.04,00:07:07.04,How did you lose that spear? >> Yee-ha!
121,00:07:18.33,00:07:18.33,"Oh, he's a nice one. There we are, boys."
122,00:07:22.96,00:07:22.96,It's fish. It's a puffer thing.
123,00:07:27.08,00:07:27.08,"It's kind of freaky. That is a freaky, freaky thing."
124,00:07:32.71,00:07:32.71,"Right around camp, the fish population seems to consist of"
125,00:07:35.62,00:07:35.62,"nothing but poisonous puffer fish, which we've caught in"
126,00:07:37.96,00:07:37.96,droves. So it's not like we're
127,00:07:40.79,00:07:40.79,not catching fish; we're just catching the ones we can't eat.
128,00:07:44.33,00:07:44.33,"To spend two or three hours out there, when you could be doing"
129,00:07:46.54,00:07:46.54,"things around camp to help everybody, and you, like, come"
130,00:07:49.33,00:07:49.33,back empty-handed is getting really old.
131,00:07:52.25,00:07:52.25,">> Yee-ha! >> Oh, there he is."
132,00:07:55.88,00:07:55.88,"Hey, that's a good little fat fish."
133,00:07:58.04,00:07:58.04,">> Good job. >> Oh, thanks."
134,00:08:00.29,00:08:00.29,">> Terry, the sole provider of this tribe came up with Nemo--"
135,00:08:05.42,00:08:05.42,"that's right, I'm talking a fish about yea big."
136,00:08:08.17,00:08:08.17,We have applauded that fish as if he caught a 14-pound catfish.
137,00:08:13.12,00:08:13.12,"We were so excited about that damn thing, I don't even know"
138,00:08:15.54,00:08:15.54,"how to talk about it. >> Come on, mama."
139,00:08:18.54,00:08:18.54,">> Oh, you can feel the meat in here."
140,00:08:20.08,00:08:20.08,>> Mmm. There was a lot of meat on that
141,00:08:22.29,00:08:22.29,"little guy, or maybe it just felt like a lot because we"
142,00:08:24.21,00:08:24.21,haven't had meat in so long. If we can catch a couple more of
143,00:08:27.88,00:08:27.88,"those every day, that would just be unbelievable."
144,00:08:31.04,00:08:31.04,>> Potato on that. >> Yeah.
145,00:08:40.46,00:08:40.46,">> PROBST: La Mina, come on in. Casaya, come on in."
146,00:08:55.50,00:08:55.50,"La Mina, getting your first look at the new Casaya."
147,00:08:58.58,00:08:58.58,Melinda voted out at the last Tribal Council.
148,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,"Bruce joined the tribe, returning from Exile Island."
149,00:09:06.21,00:09:06.21,"So, you guys physically look better."
150,00:09:08.50,00:09:08.50,>> I feel a hell of a lot better.
151,00:09:10.08,00:09:10.08,>> We've got Bruce with us... >> Bruce is a savior.
152,00:09:12.71,00:09:12.71,>> PROBST: How is Bruce the savior?
153,00:09:14.42,00:09:14.42,">> The first thing we noticed was the, you know, the upbeat"
154,00:09:16.12,00:09:16.12,attitude. You can't help but feel better
155,00:09:18.21,00:09:18.21,"from being around him. Plus, his knowledge took a lot"
156,00:09:20.21,00:09:20.21,"of the, uh, the actual effort and expenditure of energy off of"
157,00:09:23.17,00:09:23.17,"us, because he was willing to take the lead on everything."
158,00:09:25.67,00:09:25.67,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
159,00:09:28.42,00:09:28.42,>> Yeah. >> Let's get it on.
160,00:09:30.17,00:09:30.17,">> PROBST: It is for reward, and here's how it works."
161,00:09:32.17,00:09:32.17,Three tribe members will be the launchers.
162,00:09:34.21,00:09:34.21,"Each launcher will get two shots per round, the other four tribe"
163,00:09:37.88,00:09:37.88,members will stand on a balance beam over the water.
164,00:09:41.33,00:09:41.33,"On my ""Go,"" one tribe member will launch a ball; the other"
165,00:09:43.92,00:09:43.92,four will try to catch it. You can jump off the balance
166,00:09:47.75,00:09:47.75,"beam to catch the ball, but if you go in the water, you got to"
167,00:09:50.08,00:09:50.08,come up with the ball in order to score a point.
168,00:09:52.79,00:09:52.79,First tribe to five wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
169,00:09:55.67,00:09:55.67,for? >> Yeah.
170,00:09:57.54,00:09:57.54,>> PROBST: You're gonna want this stuff.
171,00:10:00.38,00:10:00.38,"Tarp, lanterns, some fuel, couple of blankets, some"
172,00:10:04.71,00:10:04.71,"pillows, jerry cans for water, and some rope."
173,00:10:08.04,00:10:08.04,That's for the winners. >> Excellent.
174,00:10:10.17,00:10:10.17,">> PROBST: For the losers, one tribe member will be sent to"
175,00:10:12.42,00:10:12.42,Exile Island. Big enough stakes?
176,00:10:17.12,00:10:17.12,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, La Mina,"
177,00:10:19.12,00:10:19.12,who's gonna be the three launchers?
178,00:10:21.54,00:10:21.54,">> Me, Dan and Ruth Marie. >> PROBST: Misty, Dan, Ruth"
179,00:10:24.96,00:10:24.96,"Marie will be the launchers, the other four will be on the perch."
180,00:10:27.79,00:10:27.79,"Casaya, who's gonna be the three launchers?"
181,00:10:30.08,00:10:30.08,">> Bob, Bruce and Cirie. >> PROBST: Bob, Bruce and Cirie"
182,00:10:33.04,00:10:33.04,"will be the launchers, the other four will be the catchers."
183,00:10:35.92,00:10:35.92,Let's get going. First shooters...
184,00:10:41.79,00:10:41.79,">> All right, Bob. >> PROBST: ...Bobby and Misty."
185,00:10:47.25,00:10:47.25,Ready... aim... fire at will.
186,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,Terry scores for La Mina! >> Nice one!
187,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,">> Come on, Bob. That's good, Bobby, that's good,"

189,00:11:00.67,00:11:00.67,">> PROBST: Oh, Aras gave it a shot."
190,00:11:03.17,00:11:03.17,"Misty and Bobby, taking their second shots."
191,00:11:06.12,00:11:06.12,"La Mina leads, one, zero. Ready, aim, release."
192,00:11:11.67,00:11:11.67,Bobby in the air. Aras makes a great catch for
193,00:11:14.96,00:11:14.96,Casaya. >> (cheering)
194,00:11:18.17,00:11:18.17,">> PROBST: Terry can't handle it, but Nick does."

196,00:11:23.83,00:11:23.83,one. That fell right into your lap.
197,00:11:27.25,00:11:27.25,A lot of luck for La Mina. Nice work for Casaya.
198,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,"Here we go, next two shooters. Dan and Bruce."
199,00:11:36.12,00:11:36.12,"Take your spots. La Mina leads, two, one."
200,00:11:40.50,00:11:40.50,"Ready, aim, and release. >> Hit it!"
201,00:11:43.54,00:11:43.54,">> PROBST: Bruce right on target, Danielle with a great"
202,00:11:46.12,00:11:46.12,catch for Casaya. Terry comes up with the third

204,00:11:57.12,00:11:57.12,Bruce trying to catch Casaya up. Dan looking to put them ahead.
205,00:12:01.08,00:12:01.08,"Ready, aim, release. Shane makes a leap and comes up"
206,00:12:06.42,00:12:06.42,"with it. La Mina's ball sails long, and"
207,00:12:09.58,00:12:09.58,"we are tied, three, three. Next shooters."
208,00:12:13.62,00:12:13.62,Cirie up for Casaya. Ruth-Marie launching for La

211,00:12:21.38,00:12:21.38,"see back on Bruce, right there?"

222,00:12:59.58,00:12:59.58,Unbelievable catch! Aras can't handle it.
223,00:13:03.38,00:13:03.38,"We're tied four, four. This next point could do it for"
224,00:13:07.25,00:13:07.25,either tribe. Nobody wants to go to Exile
225,00:13:10.25,00:13:10.25,"Island. For reward, here we go."
226,00:13:14.21,00:13:14.21,"Misty and Bobby. >> Come on, Bob."

230,00:13:34.42,00:13:34.42,Casaya. La Mina wins reward!
231,00:13:37.04,00:13:37.04,>> Yeah! >> (cheering)
232,00:13:42.21,00:13:42.21,>> Great catch! >> Woo!

235,00:13:53.79,00:13:53.79,Exile Island. They will return for the next
236,00:13:56.04,00:13:56.04,"immunity challenge. La Mina, as winners of this"
237,00:13:59.21,00:13:59.21,"challenge, this time you decide who you want to send to Exile"
238,00:14:03.25,00:14:03.25,Island. >> We have to decide...?
239,00:14:11.04,00:14:11.04,">> We have to send Bruce. >> Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
240,00:14:14.38,00:14:14.38,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, La Mina,"
241,00:14:16.08,00:14:16.08,who is it going to be? Who are you sending to Exile
242,00:14:18.67,00:14:18.67,Island? >> They made a very detrimental
243,00:14:21.67,00:14:21.67,move by telling us who brought back the team morale over there.
244,00:14:25.46,00:14:25.46,"Bruce, we're sending him back. >> These guys are playing for"
245,00:14:32.00,00:14:32.00,"keeps, huh? >> PROBST: So, Bruce, you will"
246,00:14:34.08,00:14:34.08,return to Exile Island. You'll come back to this game
247,00:14:36.17,00:14:36.17,for the next immunity challenge. See you when you get back.
248,00:14:51.00,00:14:51.00,"Casaya, I've got nothing else for you."
249,00:14:53.12,00:14:53.12,"Grab your stuff, head on out. La Mina, reward is yours."
250,00:14:57.46,00:14:57.46,"Get it and head on back to camp. >> Sweet spoils, you guys."
251,00:15:16.58,00:15:16.58,">> That's right. >> Oh, yeah."
252,00:15:17.92,00:15:17.92,">> Very happy for that, kid. >> I know it's not food, but"
253,00:15:20.12,00:15:20.12,"this is so awesome! >> The reward challenge, uh,"
254,00:15:23.96,00:15:23.96,"this afternoon was won by La Mina, and what we got for it was"
255,00:15:27.29,00:15:27.29,"a tarp, which basically reinforces the great shelter"
256,00:15:30.29,00:15:30.29,we've got already. We've got two huge canisters for
257,00:15:33.08,00:15:33.08,"carrying water. We got a couple of blankets, a"
258,00:15:36.17,00:15:36.17,"couple pillows and we got kerosene, so we have constant"
259,00:15:39.38,00:15:39.38,fire. I'm really stoked for my team.
260,00:15:42.17,00:15:42.17,It was a total team effort. It was great.
261,00:15:46.88,00:15:46.88,">> It's not too short, you can get, and-and you know, you need"
262,00:15:49.21,00:15:49.21,"to extend over the sides a little bit, too."
263,00:15:51.62,00:15:51.62,"Yeah, there you go. Fortunately, the shelter was"
264,00:15:54.21,00:15:54.21,"designed for a tarp, so it went up and over pretty easily."
265,00:15:57.21,00:15:57.21,>> Nice. >> We have a nice domed
266,00:16:00.08,00:16:00.08,"interior, as opposed to a slumping interior, so there's"
267,00:16:03.04,00:16:03.04,lots of space inside. Check it out.
268,00:16:06.12,00:16:06.12,>> Sweet! (thundering)
269,00:16:16.25,00:16:16.25,>> Our tarp came just in time for the big rain that just
270,00:16:19.54,00:16:19.54,started pouring down. It was torrential.
271,00:16:25.21,00:16:25.21,"I mean, it was coming down hard. >> Yeah, have a moment for him."
272,00:16:37.96,00:16:37.96,>> That guy is so hurtin'. The decision to send Bruce to
273,00:16:41.83,00:16:41.83,"Exile Island was a tough one, but he is an asset to that team,"
274,00:16:45.92,00:16:45.92,"and without Bruce, we think they're not gonna be up on their"
275,00:16:48.79,00:16:48.79,"feet as they should be. So, um, we made a tough call,"
276,00:16:52.92,00:16:52.92,"and, uh, I wouldn't want to be him."
277,00:16:56.42,00:16:56.42,(thundering) >> Did you guys boil that water
278,00:17:49.79,00:17:49.79,yet? >> It's on right now.
279,00:17:52.83,00:17:52.83,">> We lost the challenge, and the other team chose Bruce to go"
280,00:17:57.25,00:17:57.25,"to Exile Island, which I thought was one of the most evil things"
281,00:18:00.75,00:18:00.75,I've ever seen people do. It doesn't have that much grip.
282,00:18:05.08,00:18:05.08,I don't know if this is going to work.
283,00:18:09.00,00:18:09.00,"I mean, to lose the reward, and then to deal with losing Bruce"
284,00:18:12.75,00:18:12.75,"in that way, it just put us all on a downer, and it's like the"
285,00:18:17.50,00:18:17.50,last thing we need right now. >> That's your time-out stone.
286,00:18:30.92,00:18:30.92,">> It's mine for the rest of the, please actually, could no"
287,00:18:34.08,00:18:34.08,"one else sit on my thinking seat, please?"
288,00:18:37.79,00:18:37.79,>> Why does it have to be yours? >> Because I picked it!
289,00:18:41.04,00:18:41.04,"You want this one, I'll go get another one!"
290,00:18:44.29,00:18:44.29,I want one! This one!
291,00:18:46.88,00:18:46.88,">> Okay. >> If you want this one, I'll go"
292,00:18:48.83,00:18:48.83,get another one! I just want mine!
293,00:18:51.71,00:18:51.71,This one! >> I think the problems in our
294,00:18:55.88,00:18:55.88,tribe are inherent in the personalities.
295,00:18:59.08,00:18:59.08,"I'm in an alliance with three nutballs, I feel like, at this"
296,00:19:01.67,00:19:01.67,point. >> It looks like it's going to
297,00:19:05.46,00:19:05.46,fall. >> I know.
298,00:19:06.96,00:19:06.96,">> Can we just adjust it? >> Well, I want to but I'm just"
299,00:19:10.25,00:19:10.25,"trying to figure it out. Shane, what do you think?"
300,00:19:13.00,00:19:13.00,">> I don't know, you got us here, so I left it up to you."
301,00:19:17.04,00:19:17.04,"You got us here. >> I know, I asked for your help"
302,00:19:19.38,00:19:19.38,"so we could work together, but it's all right."
303,00:19:21.79,00:19:21.79,">> With Courtney and Shane, it's always something."
304,00:19:25.25,00:19:25.25,The funny thing is these are the people that you guys decided to
305,00:19:29.08,00:19:29.08,"align with, and now you hate each other, so how stupid is"
306,00:19:32.50,00:19:32.50,that? >> Can I do this?
307,00:19:36.00,00:19:36.00,">> Please, oh, I'd love it. That would make me so happy."
308,00:19:39.12,00:19:39.12,"Thanks, please. I don't think it's strong"
309,00:19:43.58,00:19:43.58,enough. You do?
310,00:19:45.75,00:19:45.75,"Go ahead, go ahead. >> You're out of your mind, man."
311,00:19:48.58,00:19:48.58,You are crazy. >> I'm just sharing an opinion.
312,00:19:53.67,00:19:53.67,Will you relax? I just... I don't know what his problem
313,00:20:01.21,00:20:01.21,"is. I'm, I'm not kidding."
314,00:20:04.12,00:20:04.12,"This is, like, not even funny right now."
315,00:20:06.12,00:20:06.12,I-I did nothing. Did I just do anything wrong?
316,00:20:08.46,00:20:08.46,">> Don't worry about it. >> I can't even say anything, of"
317,00:20:11.12,00:20:11.12,advice or anything. I just wanted his help.
318,00:20:13.12,00:20:13.12,I'm feeling really frustrated right now.
319,00:20:17.12,00:20:17.12,"I don't know, I feel like Shane needs to, like, get his angst"
320,00:20:20.50,00:20:20.50,"out on something or someone, and he's chosen me."
321,00:20:23.67,00:20:23.67,I'm really bummed about the situation.
322,00:20:26.12,00:20:26.12,">> Just let him go. >> Well, I don't like to be the"
323,00:20:29.12,00:20:29.12,"one that he's decided to pick on, with his mood."
324,00:20:33.88,00:20:33.88,">> Courtney is a lunatic, and I'm trapped with her because I"
325,00:20:37.96,00:20:37.96,made a commitment on my son's life that I would stay with her.
326,00:20:40.92,00:20:40.92,I just don't know how to get right with her.
327,00:21:07.04,00:21:07.04,">> With you two and us two kind of watching each other's backs,"
328,00:21:10.79,00:21:10.79,I think we can go really far. >> Yeah. I'd like to be with you
329,00:21:13.29,00:21:13.29,"all. >> Cool, 'cause we like you."
330,00:21:16.58,00:21:16.58,>> Sounds like a plan I'd like to work out myself.
331,00:21:18.96,00:21:18.96,>> Let's do it. >> Sally has been really working
332,00:21:21.54,00:21:21.54,"hard on trying to get Nick and Austin to kind of pair with us,"
333,00:21:25.21,00:21:25.21,'cause it seemed like there might be a little bit of a boys'
334,00:21:27.42,00:21:27.42,club going on around here. Would you like your shoulders
335,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,rubbed? >> Yeah.
336,00:21:31.88,00:21:31.88,">> Okay, just sit there. Oh."
337,00:21:35.04,00:21:35.04,I'm a natural flirt. That's something I just enjoy
338,00:21:37.75,00:21:37.75,doing. Some people are born with it.
339,00:21:40.25,00:21:40.25,(laughs) I would flirt to help get ahead.
340,00:21:45.08,00:21:45.08,I didn't come out here to sit on my rump.
341,00:21:47.46,00:21:47.46,I came out here to have a good time and play the game.
342,00:21:51.79,00:21:51.79,">> Amazing, right this second. >> I think Misty is such a smart"
343,00:21:56.33,00:21:56.33,"girl, and I think she comes across in this just, like,"
344,00:21:59.96,00:21:59.96,"nice... ""Like, I want to massage everybody."""
345,00:22:02.42,00:22:02.42,But you know there's a little extra something going into
346,00:22:04.58,00:22:04.58,"Austin and Nick's massages. >> Is there a teacher, Misty, or"
347,00:22:07.92,00:22:07.92,"is this just your natural, evolved method?"
348,00:22:10.04,00:22:10.04,">> It's my natural, evolved method."
349,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,Is it working? >> I think it is.
350,00:22:14.38,00:22:14.38,">> Okay. >> We work well together, 'cause"
351,00:22:16.38,00:22:16.38,"she has, like, that southern, kind of flirty charm, and I'm"
352,00:22:19.04,00:22:19.04,"just, like, the pal, you know? Like, ""What's up, guys?"
353,00:22:22.08,00:22:22.08,"Let's hang out."" I think between the two of us,"
354,00:22:24.50,00:22:24.50,"we're doing okay. >> Look, man, if we get into"
355,00:22:27.25,00:22:27.25,"this four strong into the merge, we're already ahead."
356,00:22:31.17,00:22:31.17,"Then can we pretend like we're weak-- ""Oh, weak ladies."
357,00:22:33.88,00:22:33.88,"We just want to go as far as we can."""
358,00:22:36.42,00:22:36.42,"I mean, I don't think it's going to come to that, 'cause they're"
359,00:22:38.75,00:22:38.75,"smart guys, but... >> You're so cute."
360,00:22:40.62,00:22:40.62,"I mean, you're, like, ""Come on. We're just little girls."""
361,00:22:42.62,00:22:42.62,">> We're just little girls. >> ""We just want to get as far"
362,00:22:44.62,00:22:44.62,"as we can."" >> I am in a position that I"
363,00:22:54.79,00:22:54.79,didn't necessarily want to be in.
364,00:22:58.17,00:22:58.17,"I'm the one that everybody's kind of come to, saying, ""Hey,"
365,00:23:00.58,00:23:00.58,"we really trust you. Um, we need you on our side."""
366,00:23:05.04,00:23:05.04,It could be construed as very dangerous to align yourself with
367,00:23:07.12,00:23:07.12,"strong guys, especially when I have two girls who seem to"
368,00:23:10.58,00:23:10.58,really trust me and-and think that I'm a really good guy.
369,00:23:14.58,00:23:14.58,>> How are we doing here? >> Good job.
370,00:23:17.46,00:23:17.46,">> My goal is to keep working on Austin and to keep, you know,"

559,00:34:19.21,00:34:19.21,">> Yeah, it happens to me every day, bro."
560,00:34:22.00,00:34:22.00,"My two options I have, personally-- and when I say"
561,00:34:25.58,00:34:25.58,"""personally"" I'm linked to Nick-- we could either go with"
562,00:34:28.88,00:34:28.88,"Sally and Misty, or we go with Dan and Terry."
563,00:34:34.12,00:34:34.12,I have the makings right now to get all the way to where I want
564,00:34:38.62,00:34:38.62,to be in this game because of the way that I'm aligned.
565,00:35:00.12,00:35:00.12,">> PROBST: For those of you who don't have torches, grab a"
566,00:35:03.38,00:35:03.38,"torch, approach the flame, dip your torch in, and get fire."
567,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,This is part of the ritual at Tribal Council because in this
568,00:35:12.71,00:35:12.71,"game, fire represents your life. As long as you have fire,"
569,00:35:15.88,00:35:15.88,"you're in the game. When your fire is gone, so are"
570,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,"you. So, catch me up."
571,00:35:23.88,00:35:23.88,"Terry, eight days out here, compared to the experiences"
572,00:35:27.12,00:35:27.12,"you've had in life, where does this rank in terms of tough?"
573,00:35:30.08,00:35:30.08,>> It's definitely up there on the physical side.
574,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,"On the mental side, not there yet, I'm sure it will be."
575,00:35:35.83,00:35:35.83,And I'm ready for what comes down the road.
576,00:35:37.71,00:35:37.71,">> PROBST: How about you, Dan? You hanging in there?"
577,00:35:40.54,00:35:40.54,">> Oh, absolutely. There's certainly deprivation"
578,00:35:42.83,00:35:42.83,"involved, and it's difficult to go many, many days without"
579,00:35:47.12,00:35:47.12,"food, but the companionship is excellent."
580,00:35:49.12,00:35:49.12,For strangers to come together and work together so well so
581,00:35:52.21,00:35:52.21,"fast, that's impressive. >> PROBST: Sally, how about the"
582,00:35:57.25,00:35:57.25,first eight days for you? >> The first eight days for me
583,00:36:00.33,00:36:00.33,have been everything I thought they could be.
584,00:36:04.17,00:36:04.17,Other than the fact that I didn't think I would come in
585,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,here and actually care about these people as much as I could
586,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"in eight days. >> PROBST: Austin, what's the"
587,00:36:11.62,00:36:11.62,"food situation? >> The X factor, Terry caught a"
588,00:36:14.67,00:36:14.67,fish yesterday that was no bigger than this.
589,00:36:17.12,00:36:17.12,"But, man, when you haven't had any protein in days, that will"
590,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,do wonders for you. I am by no means a strong
591,00:36:23.33,00:36:23.33,"fisherman, and all we can catch are the puffer fish, which,"
592,00:36:25.96,00:36:25.96,those things are poisonous. So we just hadn't had any luck
593,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,"Jeff, it sucks. >> PROBST: Well, what are you"
594,00:36:31.25,00:36:31.25,doing with the spear? >> We had a little incident with
595,00:36:33.21,00:36:33.21,"the spear. We, uh... the spear hasn't been"
596,00:36:36.12,00:36:36.12,"much luck for us, let's just put it that way."
597,00:36:38.54,00:36:38.54,">> PROBST: Misty, looking at this tribe, it seems like,"
598,00:36:41.83,00:36:41.83,"based on today, guys that are in pretty good shape."
599,00:36:44.25,00:36:44.25,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: Is there a pressure"
600,00:36:47.79,00:36:47.79,"from the women that, ""We have to live up to this""?"
601,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,>> I think in any situation when you've got a mixed group
602,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,"like this, there's always a pressure that we've got to step"
603,00:36:56.33,00:36:56.33,up to the plate and play just as well as the men are.
604,00:36:59.12,00:36:59.12,>> PROBST: Do you truly think all seven people here are all
605,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,"playing for this tribe? >> I absolutely believe that,"
606,00:37:05.29,00:37:05.29,"100%, wholeheartedly. And that's something I didn't"
607,00:37:08.12,00:37:08.12,expect coming into this game. I expected to have the little
608,00:37:10.25,00:37:10.25,"sects of people, you know, trying to pretend to pull"
609,00:37:14.08,00:37:14.08,"together and make a team out of it, but we don't have that"
610,00:37:16.08,00:37:16.08,"issue, we really are a team. >> PROBST: So, Terry, if you"
611,00:37:20.04,00:37:20.04,"really are this unified, how do you make a vote tonight?"
612,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,Are people coming here and making individual votes and
613,00:37:27.25,00:37:27.25,"we'll just see what happens? >> Obviously, there's been some"
614,00:37:30.00,00:37:30.00,talk. It's all part of the game to
615,00:37:31.33,00:37:31.33,"talk to different people on what their feeling is, and we"
616,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,all understand that someone has to go tonight.
617,00:37:38.33,00:37:38.33,">> PROBST: Ruth Marie, you're the only person in this tribe"
618,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,that came into this tribe without somebody.
619,00:37:44.08,00:37:44.08,"Did you feel that initially? >> I noticed that right away,"
620,00:37:46.92,00:37:46.92,"Jeff, yeah, um... I'm definitely the odd man out."
621,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,And it's a... it's a vulnerable seat to be in tonight.
622,00:37:55.88,00:37:55.88,">> PROBST: How about for you, Nick?"
623,00:37:58.00,00:37:58.00,Are you basing your vote on what you think?
624,00:38:00.62,00:38:00.62,You basing it on a group? >> I'm basing my vote on
625,00:38:03.71,00:38:03.71,probably more... with a group tonight.
626,00:38:08.04,00:38:08.04,There's conversations in camp. There's strategy being plotted.
627,00:38:11.79,00:38:11.79,"So, yeah, I think tonight more than individually, I'm going"
628,00:38:15.29,00:38:15.29,"with the group. >> PROBST: Okay, there is one"
629,00:38:18.38,00:38:18.38,"more thing to deal with, the hidden immunity idol."
630,00:38:21.92,00:38:21.92,"Misty, you're the only person from this tribe to go to Exile"
631,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,"Island. If, after the vote, you have"
632,00:38:26.96,00:38:26.96,"the most votes, that is when you would reveal whether or not"
633,00:38:29.67,00:38:29.67,"you found the idol. Otherwise, it remains a mystery."
634,00:38:33.33,00:38:33.33,"Okay, it is time to vote. Austin, you're up."
635,00:38:53.12,00:38:53.12,>> This is just team play. That's all.
636,00:39:06.25,00:39:06.25,">> Misty, you're a smart girl. I wish it didn't have to be"
637,00:39:10.25,00:39:10.25,this way. >> I'm going with the strength
638,00:39:25.08,00:39:25.08,of the tribe and we think that you're probably the least
639,00:39:27.50,00:39:27.50,"strong member of the tribe right now, and I'm very sorry."
640,00:39:37.29,00:39:37.29,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
641,00:39:49.25,00:39:49.25,">> PROBST: Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
642,00:39:51.75,00:39:51.75,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
643,00:39:54.04,00:39:54.04,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
644,00:39:57.62,00:39:57.62,First vote... Ruth Marie.
645,00:40:02.92,00:40:02.92,"Misty. One vote Misty, one vote Ruth"
646,00:40:05.38,00:40:05.38,Marie. Ruth Marie.
647,00:40:11.21,00:40:11.21,"Two votes Ruth, one vote Misty. Misty."
648,00:40:17.88,00:40:17.88,"We're tied-- two votes Misty, two votes Ruth Marie."
649,00:40:22.54,00:40:22.54,"Misty. That's three votes Misty, two"
650,00:40:24.67,00:40:24.67,votes Ruth Marie. Third person voted out of
651,00:40:31.38,00:40:31.38,Survivor: Exile Island... Misty.
652,00:40:35.17,00:40:35.17,"Misty, that's enough votes. One question left: Did you find"
653,00:40:37.46,00:40:37.46,"the immunity idol? >> No, I did not."
654,00:40:45.25,00:40:45.25,>> PROBST: You need to bring me your torch.
655,00:40:55.08,00:40:55.08,"Misty, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
656,00:41:12.54,00:41:12.54,"Well, based on what I heard tonight, it does seem like"
657,00:41:15.96,00:41:15.96,"you're a very unified tribe. But as the vote tonight shows,"
658,00:41:20.21,00:41:20.21,"even in the tightest of groups, somebody is always on the"
659,00:41:24.12,00:41:24.12,"outside. Grab your torches, head on back"
660,00:41:26.21,00:41:26.21,to camp. Good night.

665,00:41:53.50,00:41:53.50,>> Ten days in and we really haven't had anything to eat.
666,00:41:55.29,00:41:55.29,>> I figure we got about three more days before the entire
667,00:41:58.04,00:41:58.04,tribe can't get out of bed. >> PROBST: And at Casaya...
668,00:42:00.96,00:42:00.96,>> What are you talking about? >> We're not going to have this

672,00:42:14.79,00:42:14.79,">> Well, tonight was definitely a shock to me."
673,00:42:17.12,00:42:17.12,"I didn't expect it so soon, that's for sure."
674,00:42:20.21,00:42:20.21,"I was excited, and exuberant, and I thought we had a great"
675,00:42:23.42,00:42:23.42,"thing going, so obviously I was outplayed and out-strategized."
676,00:42:26.62,00:42:26.62,"I had a good time out here. I met some great, great people,"
677,00:42:29.96,00:42:29.96,and I wish my tribe all the luck.
678,00:42:31.33,00:42:31.33,I hope they go all the way.
