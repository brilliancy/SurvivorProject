601,00:29:55.17,00:29:55.17,"CONVINCE THE WHITE COLLARS TO GO WITH US, OR JOIN BLUE COLLAR."
602,00:29:59.40,00:29:59.40,"I MEAN, THAT'S A HUGE DRIFT."
603,00:30:02.37,00:30:02.37,">> THEY AIN'T GOING TO KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM, BROTHER."

606,00:30:10.83,00:30:10.83,TO DETERMINE WHO IS LOYAL AND WHO IS NOT.
607,00:30:21.20,00:30:21.20,>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
608,00:30:22.67,00:30:22.67,>> WE GOT TO SIT DOWN AND TALK.
609,00:30:24.40,00:30:24.40,>> WHITE COLLAR ARE THE SWING VOTES TONIGHT.
610,00:30:27.63,00:30:27.63,"CAROLYN AND I, WHEN WE MERGED WITH NAGAROTE, SHE WAS WITH THE"
611,00:30:31.37,00:30:31.37,WHITE COLLAR AND I WAS OBVIOUSLY WITH A BLUE COLLAR.
612,00:30:33.90,00:30:33.90,WE BONDED REALLY QUICKLY.
613,00:30:35.30,00:30:35.30,>> I THINK JENN AND HALI NEED TO BE SPLIT UP.
614,00:30:39.77,00:30:39.77,ARE YOU ON THE SAME PAGE?
615,00:30:40.70,00:30:40.70,">> SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE NO-COLLAR TRIBE, SO I THINK SHE"
616,00:30:45.87,00:30:45.87,"BONDS BETTER WITH THE BLUE COLLAR, SO I THINK CAROLYN WILL"
617,00:30:49.40,00:30:49.40,DEFINITELY BE AN ASSET.
618,00:30:50.23,00:30:50.23,>> I'M THINKING RED AND WHITE GET OUT BLUE.
619,00:30:53.97,00:30:53.97,I DON'T TRUST BLUE COLLAR AND I DON'T LIKE 'EM.
620,00:30:57.10,00:30:57.10,HOW CLOSE ARE YOU WITH KELLY?
621,00:31:00.50,00:31:00.50,>> I'D RATHER TARGET KELLY.
622,00:31:02.43,00:31:02.43,>> I'D LIKE TO GET OUT KELLY.
623,00:31:04.23,00:31:04.23,>> SHE'S THE ONE I TRUST THE LEAST.

627,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,AND THERE'S FIVE OF THEM.
628,00:31:20.33,00:31:20.33,THERE'S ONLY FOUR NO COLLAR.
629,00:31:21.97,00:31:21.97,AND WE'VE GOT THREE WHITE COLLARS AS SWING VOTES.
630,00:31:26.77,00:31:26.77,"IF BLUE COLLAR WINS THE VOTE TONIGHT, I'M AFRAID THAT BLUE"
631,00:31:29.50,00:31:29.50,COLLAR WILL HAVE THE VOTE UNTIL THE END OF THE GAME.
632,00:31:31.90,00:31:31.90,SO RIGHT NOW I'M SWINGING NO COLLAR.
633,00:31:36.93,00:31:36.93,>> ARE YOU THINKING YOU WANT TO WORK TOGETHER?
634,00:31:39.27,00:31:39.27,>> I WILL TELL YOU.

644,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,IS OFFERING ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
645,00:32:13.23,00:32:13.23,">> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO YET, BUT I HAVE OPTIONS"
646,00:32:16.93,00:32:16.93,"AND OPTIONS ARE ALWAYS A FANTASTIC THING TO HAVE,"
647,00:32:19.17,00:32:19.17,ESPECIALLY WHEN I TAUGHT THAT TWO DAYS AGO I WAS THE NEXT GUY
648,00:32:23.50,00:32:23.50,GOING HOME.
649,00:32:24.40,00:32:24.40,>> NO COLLARS WANT TO JOIN WITH THE WHITE COLLARS.
650,00:32:27.03,00:32:27.03,WE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE BLUE COLLARS.
651,00:32:29.70,00:32:29.70,AND THE VOTE TONIGHT IS GOING TO BE KELLY.
652,00:32:34.80,00:32:34.80,"JOIN WITH ME, JENN, SHIRIN..."
653,00:32:37.87,00:32:37.87,>> THE ORIGINAL TRIBES ARE DEFINITELY STICKING TOGETHER.
654,00:32:40.43,00:32:40.43,IT SEEMS TO BE BLUE VERSUS NO COLLAR.
655,00:32:43.97,00:32:43.97,>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE GAME?
656,00:32:45.77,00:32:45.77,>> I'M A SWING.
657,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,I CAN TRUST THE BLUE.
658,00:32:48.57,00:32:48.57,THEY ALREADY STABBED ME.
659,00:32:49.93,00:32:49.93,"I'M ALREADY WAY IN OVER MY HEAD WITH THOSE GUYS, BUT I DON'T"
660,00:32:52.50,00:32:52.50,KNOW YOU GUYS EITHER.
661,00:32:53.57,00:32:53.57,>> OKAY.

669,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,WHEREVER WE GO WILL CHANGE THIS GAME DRAMATICALLY.
670,00:33:12.10,00:33:12.10,>> YOU READY FOR THIS?
671,00:33:13.90,00:33:13.90,LIKE THIS IS...
672,00:33:14.33,00:33:14.33,>> WHAT'S GOING DOWN NOW?
673,00:33:15.80,00:33:15.80,>> WE WANT TO BE A SWINGER?
674,00:33:18.37,00:33:18.37,YOU CAN BE A SWINGER TONIGHT.
675,00:33:19.73,00:33:19.73,CAN'T TELL KELLY.
676,00:33:20.50,00:33:20.50,THE VOTE IS KELLY ON NO-COLLAR.
677,00:33:22.70,00:33:22.70,"THEY WARRANT SHIRIN, FOUR NO COLLARS AND ME AND SOMEBODY ELSE"
678,00:33:27.07,00:33:27.07,I CAN PULL.
679,00:33:27.40,00:33:27.40,I CAN PULL YOU.
680,00:33:29.50,00:33:29.50,SO YOU AND I CAN DICTATE.

684,00:33:36.97,00:33:36.97,BOTTOM OF THIS.
685,00:33:38.13,00:33:38.13,>> AND TRY TO GET ONE OF US OFF?
686,00:33:40.00,00:33:40.00,>> THAT'S TOTALLY POSSIBLE.
687,00:33:42.17,00:33:42.17,"IF THEY'RE GUNNING FOR ONE OF US, ONE OF YOU AND I, WE NEED TO"
688,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,KNOW WHICH ONE.
689,00:33:46.23,00:33:46.23,>> WHY?
690,00:33:46.93,00:33:46.93,>> BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDOL.
691,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,>> YOU... NO WAY?
692,00:33:50.73,00:33:50.73,>> WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE OF US IT'S GOING TO BE.
693,00:33:53.27,00:33:53.27,>> HOW DID YOU GET IT?
694,00:33:55.90,00:33:55.90,THAT'S GOOD.
695,00:33:56.20,00:33:56.20,">> NO ONE THINKS I HAVE AN IDOL, SO IF I GET AN INKLING THAT"

697,00:34:02.93,00:34:02.93,JUST PLAY MY IDOL.
698,00:34:04.60,00:34:04.60,I'D RATHER NOT USE MY IDOL WHEN THERE'S STILL 12 PEOPLE LEFT IN
699,00:34:07.43,00:34:07.43,THE GAME.
700,00:34:08.27,00:34:08.27,"I'D RATHER USE IT WHEN THERE'S FIVE PEOPLE LEFT IN THE GAME,"
701,00:34:11.20,00:34:11.20,BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TRIBAL WILL GO.
702,00:34:12.97,00:34:12.97,I'M TERRIFIED.
703,00:34:14.23,00:34:14.23,NO COLLAR IS TOGETHER 100% AND WE PLAN ON STAYING THAT WAY AS
704,00:34:18.70,00:34:18.70,FAR AS I KNOW.
705,00:34:21.37,00:34:21.37,"BLUE COLLAR, SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE STICKING TOGETHER, TOO."
706,00:34:23.80,00:34:23.80,BUT I THINK ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT.
707,00:34:24.97,00:34:24.97,I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.
708,00:34:48.73,00:34:48.73,>> Jeff: WOW.

715,00:35:05.53,00:35:05.53,YOU DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST.
716,00:35:07.57,00:35:07.57,"AIN'T NOBODY SAFE TONIGHT, SO I HOPE YOU GOT AN IDOL."
717,00:35:10.67,00:35:10.67,">> Jeff: KELLY, THIS IS SORT OF GOOD NEWS/BAD NEWS, BECAUSE"

723,00:35:23.03,00:35:23.03,WE'RE ALL STRATEGIZING.
724,00:35:24.13,00:35:24.13,NO ONE IS SAFE.
725,00:35:25.00,00:35:25.00,WE FEEL IT TONIGHT.
726,00:35:26.00,00:35:26.00,"IT COULD BE ANY ONE OF US, SO IT'S EXCITING."

728,00:35:31.53,00:35:31.53,"LOOKING AT IT ON THE SURFACE, THERE'S THE SENSE IN THIS GROUP,"
729,00:35:34.20,00:35:34.20,"IT IS A GAME, NO HURT FEELINGS WHEN IT'S OVER."
730,00:35:36.37,00:35:36.37,>> ABSOLUTELY.
731,00:35:37.37,00:35:37.37,EVERYONE HAS A KNIFE AND IT'S STAB OR GET STABBED.
732,00:35:40.70,00:35:40.70,SOMEONE HAS TO GO.
733,00:35:41.97,00:35:41.97,DON'T TAKE IT PERSONAL.
734,00:35:42.77,00:35:42.77,IT'S JUST THE GAME.
735,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN.
736,00:35:45.57,00:35:45.57,">> Jeff: WELL, I'M GUESSING WHEN YOU HAVE 12 PEOPLE DOING"
737,00:35:48.47,00:35:48.47,"THIS ALL DAY, THERE STARTS TO COME THIS SENSE THAT MY MOVE HAS"
738,00:35:52.17,00:35:52.17,GOT TO BE THE FOLLOWING.
739,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10,DID THAT HAPPEN FOR YOU?
740,00:35:54.93,00:35:54.93,">> OH YEAH,, OF COURSE."
741,00:35:56.93,00:35:56.93,"WHEN WE ALL GOT BACK, I SAT DOWN WITH MYSELF AND I SAID, THIS IS"
742,00:35:59.90,00:35:59.90,"THE WAY I GOT TO GO, SO MY VOTE'S GOING TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT"
743,00:36:03.07,00:36:03.07,YOU CAN COUNT ON WILL.

745,00:36:08.93,00:36:08.93,WHITE COLLARS.
746,00:36:10.07,00:36:10.07,IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THE WHITE COLLARS COULD POTENTIALLY BE THE
747,00:36:14.73,00:36:14.73,VERY IMPORTANT SWING VOTES TONIGHT?
748,00:36:16.83,00:36:16.83,>> YES.
749,00:36:17.60,00:36:17.60,YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.
750,00:36:19.20,00:36:19.20,AND THIS VOTE TONIGHT BOILS DOWN TO THE ALLIANCES THAT YOU HAVE
751,00:36:24.57,00:36:24.57,"MADE, THE PEOPLE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TRUST MAKING A DECISION"
752,00:36:31.20,00:36:31.20,AND LIVING WITH IT.

754,00:36:34.80,00:36:34.80,>> I'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE.
755,00:36:37.07,00:36:37.07,MY JOB IS WHERE CAN I FIT IN AND MAKE A HOME FOR HOPEFULLY THE
756,00:36:40.63,00:36:40.63,REST OF THIS GAME.

765,00:37:00.53,00:37:00.53,"IS DRAWN, IT'S HARD TO GO BACK THE OTHER WAY."
766,00:37:04.13,00:37:04.13,">> Jeff: SHIRIN, WERE YOU AN ACTIVE PERSON TODAY?"
767,00:37:07.20,00:37:07.20,"DID A LOT OF PEOPLE COME UP TO YOU, BUT FOR ME NOTHING MEANS"
768,00:37:10.27,00:37:10.27,ANYTHING NIL WE SEE A VOTE PLAY OUT.
769,00:37:12.40,00:37:12.40,AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I DON'T THINK I'M A SWING VOTE.
770,00:37:16.70,00:37:16.70,">> Jeff: JENN, THAT'S GOT TO BE A SCARY PROPOSITION."

772,00:37:22.90,00:37:22.90,AND THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW THAT'S SAFE IS JOE.
773,00:37:25.83,00:37:25.83,">> YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE SCARY."
774,00:37:28.10,00:37:28.10,"I MEAN, THERE'S CHAOS, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A CONSTANT BOTTOM"
775,00:37:32.53,00:37:32.53,LAYER RUMOR THAT STAYS PRETTY MUCH THERE.
776,00:37:34.97,00:37:34.97,SO WE ALL KIND OF HAVE AN IDEA RIGHT NOW.
777,00:37:37.87,00:37:37.87,WE'RE JUST HOPING THAT OUR IDEA IS THE ONE THAT GETS THE MOST.
778,00:37:42.53,00:37:42.53,">> Jeff: RODNEY, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,"

855,00:42:40.60,00:42:40.60,I THOUGHT I HAD IT IN THE BAG.
856,00:42:41.87,00:42:41.87,I THINK I MAYBE PROBABLY PISSED THEM OFF BECAUSE I DIDN'T STICK
857,00:42:45.03,00:42:45.03,"WITH THEIR ALLIANCE, SO THIS IS TO GET BACK AT ME, SO WE THOUGHT"

861,00:42:53.93,00:42:53.93,I HOPE THEY KICK SOME ASS.
