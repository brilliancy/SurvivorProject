297,00:16:21.38,00:16:21.38,>> And another thing you haveto be careful of out here is
298,00:16:23.79,00:16:23.79,like the scorpions and stufflike to hide under the branches
299,00:16:26.08,00:16:26.08,so you be careful where yougrab it.
300,00:16:28.54,00:16:28.54,">> Scorpions, huh?>> Yeah."

310,00:17:01.12,00:17:01.12,"for her doing this for 31 days,and not any help and standing"
311,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,strong.I know plenty of women that
312,00:17:08.88,00:17:08.88,wouldn't even think aboutcoming out here and enduring
313,00:17:11.75,00:17:11.75,"this.So, you know, she gets all of"
314,00:17:14.38,00:17:14.38,my love for this one.She's the best.

318,00:17:27.92,00:17:27.92,He is my fire.He is the love of my life.
319,00:17:30.75,00:17:30.75,So it was just like the skiesjust parted; the sun came out.
320,00:17:34.12,00:17:34.12,I just... and nothing else hurtafter that.
321,00:17:40.96,00:17:40.96,">> You're doing great, man.You're doing amazingly."

324,00:17:48.25,00:17:48.25,">> You know, it's like you'renot... you don't think about"
325,00:17:50.58,00:17:50.58,"these things, but when I'm outhere I don't think about that..."
326,00:17:53.67,00:17:53.67,I try not to think about thepeople I'm missing at home.
327,00:17:59.33,00:17:59.33,>> They're good.She told me to tell you that she
328,00:18:01.50,00:18:01.50,loves you.And wants to know when you're
329,00:18:03.58,00:18:03.58,getting back.>> I never thought I'd miss you
330,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,and Mom and Jamie so much.>> Wishing you could be with
331,00:18:09.25,00:18:09.25,"the cows.>> I know, me, too."
332,00:18:14.21,00:18:14.21,>> And I'm so glad I did itbecause it's changed...
333,00:18:17.75,00:18:17.75,"it's changed me to be a betterperson, to not take things for"
334,00:18:21.17,00:18:21.17,granted.Look at my hands.
335,00:18:25.46,00:18:25.46,>> It's okay.That will all fix.
336,00:18:28.25,00:18:28.25,That will all fix.>> Today has been the most
337,00:18:32.04,00:18:32.04,emotional day for my husbandand I.
338,00:18:34.71,00:18:34.71,It just showed how reallyintense our love is for each
339,00:18:37.96,00:18:37.96,other.It meant the world to me that
340,00:18:41.00,00:18:41.00,my husband came out here tosupport me.
341,00:18:45.62,00:18:45.62,"I didn't want him to go, though.>> Very cool thing, like, I've"
342,00:18:49.04,00:18:49.04,definitely changed a lot.I'm a total badass.
343,00:18:53.08,00:18:53.08,That's all I have to say aboutthat.
344,00:18:55.50,00:18:55.50,"Now when I go home, like,there's somebody that I don't"
345,00:18:58.62,00:18:58.62,have to explain this to.And to have somebody here that
346,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,"you can just tell everythingto, and know that he wouldn't"
347,00:19:04.62,00:19:04.62,use anything against you.Somebody who loves you no

350,00:19:12.88,00:19:12.88,thing.Out here you kind of forget
351,00:19:15.33,00:19:15.33,"what that feels like, and it'sreally nice."

378,00:20:42.08,00:20:42.08,">> Yeah, it is.Day 32."
379,00:20:45.25,00:20:45.25,Can't believe that.>> So when he's on a walk
380,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,"today, let's try to figure outhow we can get out because I"
381,00:20:53.54,00:20:53.54,"came up with some other ideas,too."
382,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,>> Okay.>> Things we need to think of
383,00:20:57.12,00:20:57.12,"down the line.>> Right, okay."
384,00:21:00.12,00:21:00.12,Debbie's opened up like whiteon rice in the past few days.
385,00:21:03.21,00:21:03.21,And that leads me to believethat she's turning her game face
386,00:21:07.46,00:21:07.46,on.She's throwing Coach under the
387,00:21:09.58,00:21:09.58,"bus right now, and they've beentight since day one."
388,00:21:13.96,00:21:13.96,You gotta watch out for peoplelike that.
389,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,>> ...Good to always betalking strategy and stuff.
390,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,">> Yeah.>> Um, I really think Taj needs"
391,00:21:22.58,00:21:22.58,"to go.I have this gut feeling, I keep"
392,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,"thinking that if she plays theimmunity idol, then one of us"
393,00:21:30.58,00:21:30.58,could go home.You see what I'm saying?
394,00:21:33.21,00:21:33.21,"I'm not trying to get paranoid,but I just don't want any wild"
395,00:21:35.62,00:21:35.62,"cards sneaking up on us, youknow what I'm saying?"
396,00:21:38.08,00:21:38.08,Does that sound like a plan?>> That sounds like a plan.
397,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,">> All right, I'm not trying topush, uh, Taj down your throat."
398,00:21:44.71,00:21:44.71,I want you to feel comfortableabout that.
399,00:21:46.33,00:21:46.33,">> No, I understand completely.>> I just have a feeling about"
400,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,"it, man.>> Yeah, we'll do that."
401,00:21:49.67,00:21:49.67,We'll talk with Stephen today.We can't let Taj in our ear
402,00:21:52.08,00:21:52.08,anymore.>> Uh-uh.
403,00:21:55.12,00:21:55.12,>> I'm going to go get some morewood.
404,00:21:59.58,00:21:59.58,>> Coach's strategy's not thesame as mine at this point in
405,00:22:01.88,00:22:01.88,the game.I feel like I'm really like a
406,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17,few steps ahead of Coachwhen it comes to strategy.
407,00:22:06.75,00:22:06.75,I tell him what he wants tohear at this point to make it
408,00:22:09.46,00:22:09.46,"look like I'm on the same pagehe's on, when in turn, you know,"
409,00:22:12.25,00:22:12.25,we're not really on the samepage right now.
410,00:22:22.88,00:22:22.88,">> I just feel like, you know,exactly, like I said..."
411,00:22:26.79,00:22:26.79,">> Okay, wait.Do you agree, Erinn?"
412,00:22:28.71,00:22:28.71,">> Yeah.Yeah, I agree."
413,00:22:31.62,00:22:31.62,">> Um, he definitely don't donothing around camp."
414,00:22:35.33,00:22:35.33,">> And also, I think I'm justready to see him go."
415,00:22:39.12,00:22:39.12,>> Yeah.>> It's going to have to be
416,00:22:40.71,00:22:40.71,"like we did, like y'all did withTyson."
417,00:22:42.38,00:22:42.38,It's got to be a blindside.>> Right.
418,00:22:44.08,00:22:44.08,>> Sure.>> But it has to be every
419,00:22:45.71,00:22:45.71,single one of us writing itdown.
420,00:22:47.29,00:22:47.29,>> Yeah.>> He's going to be furious
421,00:22:50.08,00:22:50.08,or devastated more.But he's going to feel mostly
422,00:22:52.96,00:22:52.96,"betrayed by me.Talk is, and this is going to"
423,00:22:56.46,00:22:56.46,break his heart and he's goingto feel like I have definitely
424,00:22:58.79,00:22:58.79,"betrayed him, but the talk isfor Coach to be the next one to"
425,00:23:01.67,00:23:01.67,"go.So, he's going to think we're"
426,00:23:03.92,00:23:03.92,voting off Taj.>> Yep.
427,00:23:05.83,00:23:05.83,>> That's who Coach will thinkwe're voting for.
428,00:23:07.25,00:23:07.25,>> Exactly.>> Okay.
429,00:23:08.83,00:23:08.83,>> He's pretty much drivingeverybody crazy in the camp
430,00:23:10.83,00:23:10.83,"right now, including me attimes."
431,00:23:13.17,00:23:13.17,"Coach thinks he's in analliance with myself, J.T., and"
432,00:23:16.17,00:23:16.17,Stephen.But J.T. and Stephen have had it
433,00:23:18.17,00:23:18.17,"as well.>> At least in the next vote,"
434,00:23:22.50,00:23:22.50,we gotta be secure in what wedo.
435,00:23:24.33,00:23:24.33,">> Okay, I think we need to goahead and kick Coach out 'cause"
436,00:23:26.54,00:23:26.54,"he's driving everybody insane.Honestly, you are two of the"
437,00:23:34.33,00:23:34.33,people that I care most aboutin this whole thing and I will
438,00:23:37.42,00:23:37.42,do anything in my power for youtwo to be sitting there at the 
439,00:23:39.88,00:23:39.88,very end.I swear to you.
440,00:23:41.88,00:23:41.88,"I swear to God I will.And honestly, I'll even do this"
441,00:23:47.17,00:23:47.17,"for y'all.If I have the immunity idol,"
442,00:23:50.58,00:23:50.58,"and it's down to us three,I will give it to one of you"
443,00:23:54.46,00:23:54.46,so I can be voted out.>> Wow.
444,00:23:57.12,00:23:57.12,>> And I mean that.I'm happy with third.
445,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,"Swear to God.I would hand it to you, J.T."
446,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17,">> That's awesome, Debbie.You're an incredible person."
447,00:24:06.96,00:24:06.96,">> I would do it.I swear to you, I'd do it."
448,00:24:11.25,00:24:11.25,>> You cannot really trustanybody's promises out here.

450,00:24:18.21,00:24:18.21,I don't know her personalrelationship with God or what
451,00:24:21.00,00:24:21.00,"her swears to God mean, but,you know, it's a very lucrative"
452,00:24:24.29,00:24:24.29,offer.A lock for sure on the final
453,00:24:27.21,00:24:27.21,two.>> She just told Stephen and
454,00:24:33.04,00:24:33.04,myself that she would doanything to see me and him
455,00:24:35.29,00:24:35.29,in the final two.Those were her exact words.
456,00:24:38.42,00:24:38.42,">> Okay, she's out.>> With Debbie making that"
457,00:24:41.25,00:24:41.25,"promise to Stephen and myself,it also makes me wonder what"
458,00:24:44.62,00:24:44.62,"other promises she's made toother people, uh, because she"
459,00:24:47.75,00:24:47.75,shows she's willing to dowhatever it takes to move

589,00:33:23.08,00:33:23.08,She is a very strong positivepresence.
590,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,I actually think she would stepaside at three and let J.T. and

638,00:36:30.92,00:36:30.92,for integrity.And so that's why we paired up
