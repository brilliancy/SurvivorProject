373,00:22:29.53,00:22:29.53,IT'S GOING TO TOUCH MY SHOULDERS.
374,00:22:31.17,00:22:31.17,IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE. >> OH!
375,00:22:32.87,00:22:32.87,>> Jeff: COCHRAN! SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL
376,00:22:36.10,00:22:36.10,COUNCIL. CANNOT BE VOTED OUT OF THIS

380,00:22:46.77,00:22:46.77,I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
381,00:22:49.30,00:22:49.30,CONGRATS. >> THANKS.
382,00:23:12.10,00:23:12.10,">> GOOD JOB, COCHRAN. >> THANK YOU."
383,00:23:14.37,00:23:14.37,>> PUBLISHED MY EXCESSIVE CELEBRATION.
384,00:23:17.20,00:23:17.20,IT'S JUST I'M VERY AWARE THERE ARE VERY FEW CHALLENGES I HAVE A
385,00:23:20.00,00:23:20.00,"CHANCE OF WINNING. >> THIS IS SO BAD-ASS, TOO."
386,00:23:23.63,00:23:23.63,IT REALLY IS. >> I THINK IT WAS TAILOR MADE
387,00:23:26.07,00:23:26.07,FOR ME. TODAY A IMMUNITY CHALLENGE WAS A
388,00:23:30.13,00:23:30.13,"TRUE ""SURVIVOR"" CLASSIC AND THE FACT I GOT TO THE FIND ROUND AND"
389,00:23:33.10,00:23:33.10,"THE FINAL ROUND WAS BETWEEN ME, THIS LITTLE PIP-SQUEAK, AND"
390,00:23:37.17,00:23:37.17,"MALCOLM, THE GOLDEN GOD OF THIS TRIBE."
391,00:23:41.03,00:23:41.03,AND THE FACT THAT I WON IS DREAM FULFILLMENT.
392,00:23:44.20,00:23:44.20,>> YOU'RE A TRUE SURVIVOR. >> THANK YOU.
393,00:23:47.03,00:23:47.03,>> GREAT JOB. >> WE'RE LEADERSHIP FOR YOU.
394,00:23:48.90,00:23:48.90,"THIS OVER-THE-TOP, SOMEWHAT OBNOXIOUS VICTORY CELEBRATION"
395,00:23:52.60,00:23:52.60,BECAUSE I KNOW THIS MOMENT PROBABLY ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN
396,00:23:55.33,00:23:55.33,AGAIN. ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL HAVING THAT
397,00:23:56.97,00:23:56.97,SORT OF DISPLAY OF BASICALLY BAD SPORTSMANSHIP IT WOULD HAVE
398,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,RUBBED THEM THE WRONG WAY BUT SOMEHOW EVERYBODY SEEMED HAPPY
399,00:24:04.23,00:24:04.23,FOR ME. AND NOW I FINALLY KNOW THE
400,00:24:06.53,00:24:06.53,"THRILL OF VICTORY. >> COCHRAN, OF ALL PEOPLE, WON"
401,00:24:09.47,00:24:09.47,IMMUNITY TODAY. I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.
402,00:24:11.70,00:24:11.70,YOU KNOW. I LIKE COCHRAN BUT SINCE I DONT
403,00:24:14.90,00:24:14.90,PLAN ON KEEPING HIM AROUND THAT LONG I'M GLAD WE GOT THIS DONE
404,00:24:20.17,00:24:20.17,EARLY SO HE CAN CHECK THAT OFF THE BUCKET LIST.
405,00:24:23.27,00:24:23.27,>> NO ONE WANTS US AROUND. >> EVERYONE WANTS TO THROW US
406,00:24:27.23,00:24:27.23,UNDER THE BUS. >> SO IT MAKES SENSE TO STICK
407,00:24:29.97,00:24:29.97,"TOGETHER. >> I TALKED TO CORINNE, SHE'S"
408,00:24:31.73,00:24:31.73,TOTALLY ON BOARD. >> REYNOLD IS DOWN.
409,00:24:33.57,00:24:33.57,>> CORINNE BRING ALONG MIKE. >> YEAH.
410,00:24:35.90,00:24:35.90,>> PHILLIP'S DEFINITELY GONNA BE GUNNING FOR ME OR REYNOLD.
411,00:24:40.57,00:24:40.57,>> THIS IS THE ONLY STRESSFUL ONE BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE
412,00:24:44.27,00:24:44.27,TIGHT. >> THEY'RE HUGE.
413,00:24:45.60,00:24:45.60,>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOT ALL MY TROOPS IN LINE BBUT THE
414,00:24:49.23,00:24:49.23,SITUATION IS VERY FLUID AND THE ONLY CERTAINTY IS WE ARE GOING
415,00:24:52.80,00:24:52.80,"TO TRIBAL COUNCIL. THERE ARE A LOT OF INDEPENDENT,"
416,00:24:54.57,00:24:54.57,FREE THINKERS AROUND HERE. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FALL
417,00:24:57.63,00:24:57.63,INTO LINE IF THIS THING IS GOING TO WORK.
418,00:24:59.87,00:24:59.87,"LUCKILY, CORINNE IS IN MY CORNER, AND SHE'S DEFINITELY A"
419,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,FIGHTER. SO WHAT I'M THINKING IS WE DO
420,00:25:13.40,00:25:13.40,A SPLIT VOTE. BETWEEN EDDIE AND REYNOLD.
421,00:25:19.03,00:25:19.03,THEREBY SENDING ONE OF THE TWO POWER BASES HOME.
422,00:25:21.90,00:25:21.90,THAT'S THE MOST PRUDENT THING TO DO.
423,00:25:24.47,00:25:24.47,">> YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE SPLIT VOTE."
424,00:25:27.80,00:25:27.80,>> JUST THINK ABOUT. >> LET ME PITCH SOMETHING ELSE
425,00:25:30.53,00:25:30.53,TO YOU. EDDIE AND REYNOLD AND ALL THE
426,00:25:32.93,00:25:32.93,FANS WANT SHERRI GONE. THEY DON'T LIKE SHERRI.
427,00:25:35.57,00:25:35.57,WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE SHERRI OUT FIRST AND MAKE IT AN EASY
428,00:25:39.23,00:25:39.23,FIRST VOTE AND SPLIT THE SECOND VOTE.
429,00:25:40.90,00:25:40.90,>> THE PROBLEM FOR THAT FOR ME IS I WANT A BIG FISH TO GO HOME
430,00:25:46.10,00:25:46.10,THE FIRST TIME. >> I EXPECTED THIS WAS GOING TO
431,00:25:48.87,00:25:48.87,HAPPEN. PHILLIP IS TALKIN TALKING ABOUT
432,00:25:51.33,00:25:51.33,SPLITTING VOTES AND FLUSHING THE
433,00:25:53.93,00:25:53.93,IDOL OUT BECAUSE I WANT TO AVOID THAT AT ALL COST.
434,00:25:57.37,00:25:57.37,I NEED REYNOLD AND EDDIE. AND I DON'T WANT THEM FLIPPING
435,00:26:01.77,00:26:01.77,OUT. >> I BELIEVE IN GETTING RID OF
436,00:26:04.33,00:26:04.33,OF THE POWER FIRST. >> I WAS FURIOUS THAT HE
437,00:26:06.77,00:26:06.77,WOULDN'T EVEN LISTEN TO WHAT I HAD TO SAY AND JUST HIS UTTER
438,00:26:11.43,00:26:11.43,DISREGARD FOR ANYONE ELSE'S FEELINGS.
439,00:26:13.43,00:26:13.43,"AND THAT WAS IT. I WASN'T ALREADY GOING TO TURN,"
440,00:26:16.57,00:26:16.57,"THAT SEALED MY FATE. >> LOOK, MY ONLY CONCERN,"
441,00:26:18.80,00:26:18.80,"REALLY, IS I DON'T WANT SPLIT VOTES."
442,00:26:21.17,00:26:21.17,IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT LITERALLY ANYBODY I'LL TAKE THEM
443,00:26:23.70,00:26:23.70,OUT. I FEEL LIKE SHERRI IS AN EASY
444,00:26:25.83,00:26:25.83,ONE. >> PHILLIP WILL BE THE HARDEST
445,00:26:27.67,00:26:27.67,TO CONVINCE. >> BUT HE'S ONE PERSON.
446,00:26:30.27,00:26:30.27,WE DON'T NEED HIM. WE SHOULD STRONG ARM HIM LIKE HE
447,00:26:33.37,00:26:33.37,STRONG ARMS US. THAT'S WHAT HE DOES TO ME ALL
448,00:26:36.13,00:26:36.13,THE TIME. >> CORIN ADAMANT WE DON'T
449,00:26:40.67,00:26:40.67,"TARGET EDDIE AND REYNOLD. IF SHERRI GOES, NO SWEAT OFF MY"
450,00:26:44.10,00:26:44.10,BACK. SHERRI IS AN EASY VOTE AND HER
451,00:26:46.37,00:26:46.37,ELIMINATION WOULD LOCK THE FAVORITES' NUMBERS IN A WAY THAT
452,00:26:48.87,00:26:48.87,WOULD BE IRREVERSIBLE. >> I THINK AT THIS POINT WE NEED
453,00:26:52.30,00:26:52.30,TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO HIM. >> IF HE'S COMPLETELY
454,00:26:55.87,00:26:55.87,"OUTNUMBERED, HE'S NOT GOING TO BE A VOCAL MINORITY ABOUT IT."
455,00:26:59.20,00:26:59.20,WHAT DOESN'T BODY WELL IS CORAND I KNOW PHILLIP HATE EACHING AND
456,00:27:02.77,00:27:02.77,HAVE A SUSPICION OF EACH OTHER THAT IS UNHEALTHY AND IF THE
457,00:27:07.57,00:27:07.57,"FAVORITES DON'T COME TOGETHER, THAT IS ADMITTING TO THE WORLD,"
458,00:27:11.83,00:27:11.83,"FANS INCLUDING, THAT WE'RE A DYSFUNCTIONAL GROUP THAT DOESN'T"
459,00:27:14.97,00:27:14.97,"TRUST EACH OTHER, THERE ARE OPENINGS, AND WE'RE APT TO FALL"
460,00:27:18.87,00:27:18.87,"APART, GIVEN THE RIGHT CATALYST. >> AND DAWN IS ACTUALLY ON THE"
461,00:27:33.57,00:27:33.57,OUTS. SHE'S PROBABLY WILLING TO COME
462,00:27:34.90,00:27:34.90,"WITH US, TOO. WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE FIRST"
463,00:27:38.03,00:27:38.03,VOTE. >> WE HAVE TO KNOCK OUT SHERRI.
464,00:27:40.10,00:27:40.10,>> SURE. >> HOPEFULLY THAT LAIB SLAM-DUNK
465,00:27:42.97,00:27:42.97,AND THEN WE CAN MOVE FROM THERE. >> I'VE HITCHED MY WAGON TO THIS
466,00:27:47.57,00:27:47.57,MALCOLM AND CORINNE COUNTER-ALLIANCE AND THEY'RE
467,00:27:50.00,00:27:50.00,RECEPTIVE TO THE IDEA OF BRINGING SOME OF THE FANS IN AND
468,00:27:53.47,00:27:53.47,OVER-THROWING THE TYRANNY OF LORD PHILLIP OF THE HIGH
469,00:27:56.03,00:27:56.03,"SHELTER. AND I'M JUST LIKE, THIS IS"
470,00:27:58.17,00:27:58.17,AMAZING. >> PHILLIP'S GOT THIS
471,00:28:00.57,00:28:00.57,GRANDIOSE-- HE THINKS HE IS TOTALLY GOING TO THE END.
472,00:28:02.43,00:28:02.43,">> THE WAY HE WALKS AROUND CAMP, TOO."
473,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA. >> IT'S SO POMPOUS.
474,00:28:07.40,00:28:07.40,>> I WANT TO PUNCH HIM EVERY DAY.
475,00:28:10.43,00:28:10.43,I HATE HIM. HATE.
476,00:28:11.93,00:28:11.93,"AS LONG AS YOU TRUST ME, I'LL TRUST YOU."
477,00:28:15.90,00:28:15.90,DON'T WAIVER. LET'S CLEAN UP THE HOUSE.
478,00:28:19.00,00:28:19.00,>> LET'S CLEAN IT UP. >> I'M GOING TO GO BACK.
479,00:28:21.97,00:28:21.97,">> OBVIOUSLY, EDDIE AND I HAVE BEEN DELUSIONALLY OPTIMISTIC THE"
480,00:28:26.90,00:28:26.90,"ENTIRE GAME. IF THIS VOTE GOES AS PLANNED, IS"
481,00:28:31.13,00:28:31.13,IT & SHERRI GOING GZ HOME I'LL DEFINITELY BE IN AN ALLIANCE
482,00:28:35.43,00:28:35.43,THAT'S CALLING THE SHOTS AND I'LL BE BACK IN BUSINESS.
483,00:28:53.23,00:28:53.23,BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS AM I BEING
484,00:28:57.57,00:28:57.57,HURT? I DO FEEL LIKE THIS ALLIANCE IS
485,00:28:58.93,00:28:58.93,A DEMOCRACY? DO I FEEL LIKE WHEN I COME WITH
486,00:29:01.83,00:29:01.83,"A POINT, DO PEOPLE TREAT ME LIKE I'M AN IDIOT."
487,00:29:03.33,00:29:03.33,">> AFTER THIS VOTE, IF PHILLIP KEEPS TREATING ME THE WAY HE HAS"
488,00:29:06.47,00:29:06.47,I WANT HIM GOING GUNN. THE REASON IT'S EASY TO TAKE
489,00:29:09.37,00:29:09.37,PHILLIP IS YOU CAN GET ANYBODY BEHIND IT.
490,00:29:12.23,00:29:12.23,MALCOLM WOULD DO IT. EDDIE AND REYNOLD ARE VERY
491,00:29:15.97,00:29:15.97,WILLING TO PLAY BALL. >> WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL?
492,00:29:18.70,00:29:18.70,">> 100% VOTE. >> THAT'S, LIKE, SIX PEOPLE."
493,00:29:23.93,00:29:23.93,"MALCOLM, YOU-- >> ERIK."
494,00:29:25.43,00:29:25.43,">> IF ERIK'S IN, TOO, THAT'S, LIKE, SEVEN."
495,00:29:28.93,00:29:28.93,CORINNE IS SUGGESTING I JOIN WITH THEM AND BREAK UP THE
496,00:29:33.17,00:29:33.17,"ALLIANCE OF THE FAVORITES, AND I'M THINKING, OKAY, HERE WE GO"
497,00:29:36.40,00:29:36.40,AGAIN. LAST TIME I PLAYED I CAME INTO
498,00:29:38.03,00:29:38.03,"THIS KIND OF INFORMATION, AND I DIDN'T SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY,"
499,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,AND THAT WAS MY DOWNFALL LAST TIME.
500,00:29:43.27,00:29:43.27,SO I CAN'T REPEAT THAT SAME MISTAKE.
501,00:29:54.27,00:29:54.27,SHE WANTS TO BLINDSSIDE PHILLIP AND THE REST OF THE FAVORITES
502,00:29:59.70,00:29:59.70,AND SHE'S GOT THE FANS TO DO IT. THOSE GUYS ARE IN HER BACK
503,00:30:04.50,00:30:04.50,POCKET NOW. >> DAWN JUST APPROACHED ME VERY
504,00:30:10.93,00:30:10.93,FRANTIC SAYING CORINNE LET IT BE KNOWN THAT APPARENTLY SHE
505,00:30:13.63,00:30:13.63,REALLIED THIS GROUP OF TROOPS TOGETHER THAT GIVES HER THE
506,00:30:16.10,00:30:16.10,NUMBERS AND POST-MERGE CONTROL OF THE GAME.
507,00:30:17.73,00:30:17.73,">> AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT SHERRI, SO WE'LL BE AT 11 AND"
508,00:30:21.63,00:30:21.63,THEY'LL BE AT SIX. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VOTING OUT
509,00:30:24.97,00:30:24.97,"REYNOLD OR EDDIE, WHICH IS CORINNE'S DOING."
510,00:30:26.93,00:30:26.93,">> YEAH. OH, BROTHER."
511,00:30:30.27,00:30:30.27,">> I PROMISE IF I HAD NUMBERS TO VOTE HER OUT TONIGHT, I WOULD"
512,00:30:33.73,00:30:33.73,VOTE HER OUT. >> WOULD LOVE THAT.
513,00:30:35.27,00:30:35.27,">> SHERRI'S A POSSIBLE VOTE WITH US, SO..."
514,00:30:39.87,00:30:39.87,>> I THINK WE HAVE BRENDA. >> EVEN WE GOT BRENDA TONIGHT.
515,00:30:43.53,00:30:43.53,"BRENDA, YOU, ME, ANDREA, PHILLIP."
516,00:30:46.37,00:30:46.37,SHERRI IS STILL SIX. THEN IT'S A TIE.
517,00:30:50.03,00:30:50.03,">> CORINNE, WHO I THOUGHT DIDN'T HAVE A STRATEGIC BONE IN HER"
518,00:30:53.53,00:30:53.53,"BODY, SHE'S POSITIONED HERSELF IN A WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN"
519,00:30:59.30,00:30:59.30,BASICALLY ACQUIESCING TO EVERY DEMAND SHE'S MADE.
520,00:31:01.47,00:31:01.47,"SO IT'S A SOBERING SITUATION, AND IF WE DON'T COME UP WITH A"
521,00:31:05.30,00:31:05.30,PLAN IT COULD BE DEVASTATING TO MY GAME AND THE GAME OF MY
522,00:31:11.53,00:31:11.53,ALLIES. >> WHAT'S UP?
523,00:31:12.60,00:31:12.60,">> APPARENTLY, LIKE, CORINNE APPROACHED DAWN AND SHE MADE IT"
524,00:31:18.57,00:31:18.57,"SOUND LIKE SHE HAS REYNOLD, EDDIE, MALCOLM, ERIK, AND"
525,00:31:24.73,00:31:24.73,MICHAEL. AND IF WE VOTE OFF SHERRI
526,00:31:27.70,00:31:27.70,TONIGHT OORKTS FIVE VERSUS SIX. AND THEY'LL VOTE OFF PHILLIP
527,00:31:31.07,00:31:31.07,NEXT. >> YEAH.
528,00:31:31.73,00:31:31.73,">> IF WE'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE NUMBERS, WE'RE DEAD."
529,00:31:35.57,00:31:35.57,>> HM. EVERYONE WAS ON BOARD WITH
530,00:31:38.73,00:31:38.73,"VOTING SHERRI OUT, AND THEN I HEARD THAT COIRN IS TALKING"
531,00:31:42.40,00:31:42.40,"ABOUT POSSIBLY FLIPPING, AND IF SHE CAN PULL ALL THESE PEOPLE,"
532,00:31:46.97,00:31:46.97,THEN WE'RE ALL SCREWED. SO SHE'S DANGEROUS.
533,00:31:50.20,00:31:50.20,>> CORINNE IS FREAKING CALLING EVERY VOTE.
534,00:31:52.57,00:31:52.57,>> I'M KIND OF UP FOR A LITTLE BLINDSIDE.
535,00:31:56.03,00:31:56.03,>> IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO.
536,00:31:58.43,00:31:58.43,">> WELL, IF WE CAN GET SHERRI AND-- ERIK'S WISHY-WASHY."
537,00:32:06.67,00:32:06.67,I GUESS HE WOULD GO ALONG WITH WHAT MALCOLM.
538,00:32:12.60,00:32:12.60,"IT'S RIDICULOUS TO THINK I'M COUNTING ON SHERRI, WHO IS ONE"
539,00:32:15.17,00:32:15.17,"OF THE FANS, AND EVEN ERIK, OF ALL PEOPLE."
540,00:32:17.80,00:32:17.80,HE'S THE HUGE QUESTION MARK BECAUSE HE DISTRIBUTE TALK
541,00:32:20.43,00:32:20.43,STRATEGY TO ANYBODY WHICH MAKES ME NERVOUS BECAUSE I HAVE NO
542,00:32:23.17,00:32:23.17,"IDEA WHAT HE'S THINKING. >> CORINNE, SHE HAS REYNOLD,"
543,00:32:30.10,00:32:30.10,"EDDIE, AND MICHAEL. SHE HAS ENOUGH PEOPLE TO"
544,00:32:33.67,00:32:33.67,BLINDSIDE YOU NEXT VOTE AFTER SHER EERK WHICH MEANS THEN IT'S

580,00:34:52.27,00:34:52.27,THAT WOULD CONTINUE TONIGHT? >> I THINK IT IS A FAIR
581,00:34:55.50,00:34:55.50,ASSUMPTION. IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR TO US
582,00:34:58.93,00:34:58.93,THAT THE FAVORITES ARE GOING TO BE STICKING TOGETHER.
583,00:35:02.23,00:35:02.23,>> Jeff: CORINNE AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS PLAYED THIS GAME YOU CAN

585,00:35:06.67,00:35:06.67,FANS WHERE IT FEELS A LITTLE HELPLESS.

598,00:35:46.73,00:35:46.73,I WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE WORRIED IF SHE DIDN'T SAY SHE WAS OPEN
599,00:35:50.30,00:35:50.30,TO THAT POSSIBILITY. THAT WOULD MAKE ME MORE
600,00:35:53.20,00:35:53.20,"SUSPICIOUS. >> Jeff: REYNOLD, WHAT DO YOU"
