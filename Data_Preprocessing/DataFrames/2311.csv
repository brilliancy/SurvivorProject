624,00:18:32.90,00:18:32.90,OF HIM.
625,00:18:34.70,00:18:34.70,WE CAN'T GET TO THE MERGE AND
626,00:18:35.83,00:18:35.83,START HAVING A MELTDOWN AND
627,00:18:37.93,00:18:37.93,TELLING HIM THE GAME PLAN AND HE
628,00:18:39.53,00:18:39.53,DOES EVERY TIME.
629,00:18:40.30,00:18:40.30,BRANDON CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME.
630,00:18:42.50,00:18:42.50,THE WORLD IS VERY BLACK AND
631,00:18:43.97,00:18:43.97,"WHITE TO HIM, NOT SHADES OF"
632,00:18:46.50,00:18:46.50,"GRAY, WHICH IN REALITY IT IS."
633,00:18:47.77,00:18:47.77,I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS DESIGNED
634,00:18:49.30,00:18:49.30,"FOR THIS, IN THIS PHASE OF HIS"

642,00:19:00.30,00:19:00.30,"MELTDOWNS IN TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND"

1073,00:31:01.60,00:31:01.60,HERCULES.

1076,00:31:05.17,00:31:05.17,I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
1077,00:31:06.20,00:31:06.20,THE RAGING BULL OF MINOS WAS
1078,00:31:08.90,00:31:08.90,STRONGER THAN HERCULES AND &
1079,00:31:10.70,00:31:10.70,WHAT HERCULES DID THAT MOST
1080,00:31:12.70,00:31:12.70,PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS HE USED HIS
1081,00:31:14.33,00:31:14.33,BRAIN TO BEAT THE BULL.
1082,00:31:15.60,00:31:15.60,HE MOUNTED THE BULL AND FORCED
1083,00:31:16.90,00:31:16.90,IT TO SWIM UP THE RIVER ALL THE
1084,00:31:18.60,00:31:18.60,"WAY TO THE CAPITAL, AND BY THE"
1085,00:31:20.60,00:31:20.60,TIME THEY HAD GOTTEN TO THE

1087,00:31:23.73,00:31:23.73,HERCULES JUMPED OFF OF HIM AND
1088,00:31:25.17,00:31:25.17,SLEW HIM.
1089,00:31:26.23,00:31:26.23,THAT IS VERY APPROPRIATE.
1090,00:31:27.47,00:31:27.47,IT'S EXTREMELY APPROPRIATE.
1091,00:31:28.33,00:31:28.33,DAMN RIGHT IT'S APPROPRIATE.
1092,00:31:29.93,00:31:29.93,COACH IN DUBBING ME HERCULES

1114,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,I'M ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN.
1115,00:32:09.53,00:32:09.53,DESPITE COACH'S CLAIMS THAT ZEUS

1145,00:33:05.93,00:33:05.93,GREAT MOVE IF HE HAD USED HIS
1146,00:33:08.77,00:33:08.77,TALENTS TO MAKE SOME FRIEND
1147,00:33:09.67,00:33:09.67,AMONG THE OLD UPOLU TRIBE.
1148,00:33:10.93,00:33:10.93,I'VE BEEN THE PROVIDER FOR MY

1156,00:33:26.93,00:33:26.93,IT'S A SHAME THAT I'VE GOT TO

1162,00:33:37.77,00:33:37.77,AS POSSIBLE.

1166,00:33:44.37,00:33:44.37,"THAT, DO YOU?"
1167,00:33:44.93,00:33:44.93,IT ALWAYS GETS TOUGH TO FEED
1168,00:33:47.43,00:33:47.43,THE COMPETITION.

1185,00:34:10.47,00:34:10.47,MAYBE BEING A MOM OF SIX IS--
1186,00:34:12.47,00:34:12.47,I'M NOT USED TO BEING SO FOIXED
1187,00:34:15.93,00:34:15.93,ON PRESERVING MYSELF.

1192,00:34:26.17,00:34:26.17,FEEDING THE COMPETITION IS
1193,00:34:27.93,00:34:27.93,KIND OF A WEIRD IDEA.
1194,00:34:29.30,00:34:29.30,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
1195,00:34:30.23,00:34:30.23,"YEAH, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE."

1352,00:39:05.83,00:39:05.83,POINT IS NOT THE SMARTEST THING
1353,00:39:07.07,00:39:07.07,TO DO.

1361,00:39:19.60,00:39:19.60,AND THERE'S A POINT IN TIME YOU

1365,00:39:24.87,00:39:24.87,SHOULD HAVE GRABBED HIM BY THE

1370,00:39:33.10,00:39:33.10,HE'S SO INTULSIVE SOMETIMES.
1371,00:39:34.47,00:39:34.47,HE'S ONLY A KID.
1372,00:39:36.57,00:39:36.57,HE'S 19 YEARS OLD.
1373,00:39:38.37,00:39:38.37,YOU HAVE TO CORAL HIM A LOT OF
1374,00:39:40.40,00:39:40.40,TIMES AND REEL HIM BACK IN BUT I

1380,00:39:50.23,00:39:50.23,BRANDON LOSING THE CHICKEN.
1381,00:39:52.83,00:39:52.83,MAYBE BRANDON CAN PRAY FOR IT
1382,00:39:54.20,00:39:54.20,AND IT WILL SHOW BACK UP.
1383,00:39:56.33,00:39:56.33,Jeff: BRANDON'S INSTABILITY
1384,00:39:58.10,00:39:58.10,WASN'T THE ONLY THREAT FACING

1393,00:40:12.20,00:40:12.20,OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DO THAT
1394,00:40:14.70,00:40:14.70,RIGHT NOW.
1395,00:40:15.07,00:40:15.07,HE'S AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
1396,00:40:16.57,00:40:16.57,PERSON.
1397,00:40:16.93,00:40:16.93,I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD VOTE
1398,00:40:19.03,00:40:19.03,OUT BRANDON FIRST.
1399,00:40:20.03,00:40:20.03,THERE'S NO POINT.
1400,00:40:20.67,00:40:20.67,BRANDON COULD WIN IMMUNITY.
1401,00:40:22.37,00:40:22.37,I'M NOT TERRIFIED THAT
1402,00:40:23.87,00:40:23.87,BRANDON IS GOING TO GO ON AN

1404,00:40:26.07,00:40:26.07,HE'S NOT.
1405,00:40:26.93,00:40:26.93,I THINK ALBERT THINKS HE HAS
1406,00:40:30.03,00:40:30.03,THIS GREAT STRATEGIC MIND AND I
1407,00:40:31.43,00:40:31.43,DON'T THINK HE'S COME UP WITH
1408,00:40:34.17,00:40:34.17,ONE GOOD PLAN YET.
1409,00:40:35.17,00:40:35.17,HIS RECENT PLAN IS GET RID OF
1410,00:40:37.27,00:40:37.27,BRANDON SOONER.
1411,00:40:37.87,00:40:37.87,I DON'T SEE THE IN THAT.
1412,00:40:40.03,00:40:40.03,EVERYONE IS GOING TO GO ALONG
1413,00:40:41.10,00:40:41.10,WITH GETTING OUT SAVAII.

1415,00:40:44.03,00:40:44.03,WITH GETTING OUT BRANDON.
1416,00:40:45.23,00:40:45.23,THE LAST THING I WANT IS FOR

1418,00:40:49.03,00:40:49.03,WHAT'S THE POINT IN PISSING
1419,00:40:50.73,00:40:50.73,BRANDON OFF.
1420,00:40:51.53,00:40:51.53,HE COULD COME BACK.
1421,00:40:52.70,00:40:52.70,I THINK MIXING THINGS UP THIS
1422,00:40:54.73,00:40:54.73,EARLY IS CRAZY BECAUSE PEOPLE
1423,00:40:57.10,00:40:57.10,LIKE RICK ARE GOING TO SAY WE
