18,00:00:39.47,00:00:39.47,"and bodies were pushed to the limit, and Morgan was the"

23,00:00:52.20,00:00:52.20,a hell of a lot of power right now.

26,00:00:58.23,00:00:58.23,They're planning on getting rid of you tonight.
27,00:01:01.07,00:01:01.07,>> PROBST: But Rupert turned the tables with a plan of his own by
28,00:01:03.00,00:01:03.00,"going to Shawn for support. >> I'm with you on that, baby."

41,00:02:51.60,00:02:51.60,"I would have made a decision... >> Damn it, look at me!"
42,00:02:54.00,00:02:54.00,>> I'm looking at you. >> What the ... was that ...
43,00:02:56.10,00:02:56.10,>> I made a decision based on... You're starting
44,00:02:58.17,00:02:58.17,>> You're starting this ... now! Damn it.
45,00:03:00.67,00:03:00.67,"At Tribal Council, I dodged the biggest"
46,00:03:04.73,00:03:04.73,cannonball aimed right at me. I knew when I saw two
47,00:03:08.27,00:03:08.27,"""Ruperts"" in the vote, that Trish and Jon were"
48,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83,against me. I was ready to
49,00:03:15.47,00:03:15.47,"kill Jon, literally grab that little scrawny ass by the neck"
50,00:03:19.07,00:03:19.07,and pop his head off him like a ... chicken.
51,00:03:22.07,00:03:22.07,I'm out there kicking my ass to get you ... damn fish
52,00:03:24.97,00:03:24.97,and you ... turn the tribe against me!

55,00:03:31.17,00:03:31.17,>> Who did? >> The... the person that's gone
56,00:03:33.60,00:03:33.60,right now is the person that came up with the idea.
57,00:03:35.67,00:03:35.67,>> Who voted for me? >> I did.
58,00:03:37.60,00:03:37.60,>> I ... realized it today that she was lying to me

65,00:03:57.33,00:03:57.33,conversation. >> Included?
66,00:03:58.60,00:03:58.60,In ... me? You ... me!
67,00:04:01.60,00:04:01.60,You were included. >> I didn't...
68,00:04:04.20,00:04:04.20,"Hey, I made the decision based on Drake."
69,00:04:06.33,00:04:06.33,>> Drake made the decision. You were the odd man out.
70,00:04:09.40,00:04:09.40,>> JON: I've never seen a guy more mad in my entire
71,00:04:12.63,00:04:12.63,"life. I mean, he's right in"
72,00:04:14.17,00:04:14.17,my face. He's ready to punch me.
73,00:04:15.57,00:04:15.57,"But if there were to be a merge, Rupert's absolutely a"
74,00:04:17.40,00:04:17.40,"threat. I mean, he could"
75,00:04:19.00,00:04:19.00,"switch on a dime. He says he'd never do it,"
76,00:04:21.50,00:04:21.50,but it pissed me off when he... when he helped Morgan win
77,00:04:24.33,00:04:24.33,"that challenge, and, uh, I... I'm not the kind of guy that"
78,00:04:26.70,00:04:26.70,"forgives or forgets You said in your own words,"
79,00:04:29.57,00:04:29.57,"""If any one of us went over to Morgan, that they would vote"
80,00:04:33.93,00:04:33.93,"them off. ""However, you did say if there was one person that"

82,00:04:39.47,00:04:39.47,be you. >> I never said that in
83,00:04:41.23,00:04:41.23,"a ... million years. >> Well, I was under the"
84,00:04:43.73,00:04:43.73,impression that you did. >> Who the hell would even have
85,00:04:46.80,00:04:46.80,the ... arrogance to say that?
86,00:04:48.10,00:04:48.10,>> I... I thought that was a ballsy ass statement.
87,00:04:50.20,00:04:50.20,">> Why... if I thought that, why wouldn't I"
88,00:04:51.97,00:04:51.97,have stayed there and made the Morgans stronger?

90,00:04:56.17,00:04:56.17,"That, that makes... that makes a lot of sense."
91,00:04:58.10,00:04:58.10,">> I would have stayed there and said, ""You"
92,00:04:59.80,00:04:59.80,"Drakes are dead."" >> And I was"
93,00:05:01.10,00:05:01.10,scared to death that you were going to turn on us.
94,00:05:02.67,00:05:02.67,>> I am the one person that will always
95,00:05:04.40,00:05:04.40,stand true to Drake. >> I was following some...
96,00:05:06.80,00:05:06.80,">> You were following Trish, who was telling every one of us"
97,00:05:09.97,00:05:09.97,you and me are going to be the final two.
98,00:05:11.87,00:05:11.87,She was telling every one of us that.
99,00:05:14.23,00:05:14.23,Let's start fresh. >> All right.
100,00:05:15.63,00:05:15.63,"It sucks, man. I'm sorry. >> We're all done,"
101,00:05:19.27,00:05:19.27,"and we'll be five strong Drakes, okay?"
102,00:05:21.60,00:05:21.60,>> All right. >> We're to be five strong
103,00:05:23.50,00:05:23.50,Drake. >> Yep.
104,00:05:24.40,00:05:24.40,">> RUPERT: I'm not saying Jon is finished yet, but..."
105,00:05:27.77,00:05:27.77,( sighs ) I'm not saying that I believe
106,00:05:33.33,00:05:33.33,him at all anymore. I don't
107,00:05:35.90,00:05:35.90,"believe a damn word he says. >> I'm sorry, man."
108,00:05:38.20,00:05:38.20,"I don't know why I believed that, I just did."
109,00:05:42.00,00:05:42.00,>> Jonny Fairplay is Jonny Pain-In-The-Ass now
110,00:05:43.67,00:05:43.67,to me. (thunder)
111,00:05:54.27,00:05:54.27,"(wind whistling) >> Bull ... rain, go away."
112,00:06:18.53,00:06:18.53,"I can't even get out in the ocean;  I get pounded around,"
113,00:06:22.67,00:06:22.67,try to get a fish. >> ANDREW: Day 19.
114,00:06:26.57,00:06:26.57,A little worn out. I think there's a direct
115,00:06:28.63,00:06:28.63,correlation between lack of protein in our bodies and
116,00:06:31.93,00:06:31.93,"energy, and then Rupert came over for a couple of days."
117,00:06:35.23,00:06:35.23,"We had some fish, dramatic increase in energy-- I felt"
118,00:06:38.67,00:06:38.67,"like a new person. Right now,"
119,00:06:40.63,00:06:40.63,we'd probably give anything to have Rupert over here.
120,00:06:43.57,00:06:43.57,"In fact, we definitely would give anything to have Rupert"
121,00:06:45.90,00:06:45.90,"over here. >> Dude, there's a stingray"
122,00:06:47.13,00:06:47.13,"right there. Dude, dude, dude! Whoa, he's right there."
123,00:06:50.23,00:06:50.23,You see him? He's right there.
124,00:06:51.53,00:06:51.53,"Yes! >> He's long gone now, pal."
125,00:07:10.60,00:07:10.60,">> It's not that we don't want the fish, it's that we're"
126,00:07:13.73,00:07:13.73,having great difficulty catching them.
127,00:07:15.10,00:07:15.10,This is the most I've ever eat beans in my
128,00:07:18.40,00:07:18.40,whole life. >> You can only eat
129,00:07:19.90,00:07:19.90,so many beans. >> RYNO: Why's that?
130,00:07:22.13,00:07:22.13,>> 'Cause they suck. ( Tijuana laughs )
131,00:07:24.57,00:07:24.57,>> TIJUANA: We only have two portions of rice
132,00:07:26.63,00:07:26.63,left. >> OSTEN: It's imperative
133,00:07:28.67,00:07:28.67,that we merge. It's imperative.
134,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,"'Cause, I'm... I'm bigger than everybody else."
135,00:07:34.83,00:07:34.83,"I'm, like, 200 pounds. I'm probably like 175 right now."
136,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,"I have no energy to do anything, and, uh..."
137,00:07:40.73,00:07:40.73,it's wearing on me. >> ANDREW: It's so difficult
138,00:07:46.00,00:07:46.00,because we know if we had as much fish as the Drake Tribe
139,00:07:49.90,00:07:49.90,"has, we'd be having parties every night, dancing and"
140,00:07:52.17,00:07:52.17,singing. I can't imagine
141,00:07:54.27,00:07:54.27,having my own fish. It just...
142,00:07:56.80,00:07:56.80,"it's depressing to think about, actually; I'd rather"
143,00:08:00.87,00:08:00.87,"not think about it. >> RYNO: Think if, uh, Skinny"
144,00:08:04.00,00:08:04.00,Ryan were still... still here. >> He would have perished.
145,00:08:07.90,00:08:07.90,>> ( laughing ): He would perish.
146,00:08:09.63,00:08:09.63,>> Yeah. >> So would Lill.
147,00:08:12.03,00:08:12.03,">> TIJUANA: Yeah, I think so, too."
148,00:08:13.97,00:08:13.97,">> ANDREW: You know, it gets mentally overwhelming"
149,00:08:16.30,00:08:16.30,and draining to think about all the things we need to do
150,00:08:20.00,00:08:20.00,"just to survive out here, and it's exhausting."
151,00:08:25.07,00:08:25.07,>> I'm tired today. >> My entire body aches.
152,00:08:28.40,00:08:28.40,">> And you can see on my tribe mates, it's taking their toll."
153,00:08:33.40,00:08:33.40,"O. T., this morning, he has good days and he has"
154,00:08:36.53,00:08:36.53,bad days; this morning he checked out-- I could see it
155,00:08:37.97,00:08:37.97,"in his eyes,  I could read it a mile away."
156,00:08:39.90,00:08:39.90,He's... he's somewhere. He's not here.
157,00:08:45.03,00:08:45.03,He didn't sleep at all last night from what I could see
158,00:08:47.30,00:08:47.30,"'cause he kept me up, but he'll rally if we need him"
159,00:08:49.87,00:08:49.87,for something... hopefully. >> SHAWN: I'm curious to see
160,00:09:05.00,00:09:05.00,"what's going on today. I've got a hunch, baby."
161,00:09:08.83,00:09:08.83,I got more than a hunch. I know this is the biggest sea
162,00:09:11.47,00:09:11.47,"mail we'll ever see. >> RUPERT: My tribe, they have"
163,00:09:14.20,00:09:14.20,it in their heads that we're going to a new island
164,00:09:17.57,00:09:17.57,and having a big party and going to go with Morgans
165,00:09:20.60,00:09:20.60,"and be in a merge. >> All right, guys, here we go."
166,00:09:23.77,00:09:23.77,">> If it happens, okay, but I'm not looking forward to it,"
167,00:09:28.27,00:09:28.27,"because I have a strong tribe right now, I do not"
168,00:09:30.70,00:09:30.70,"want to merge yet, and I cannot plan on a merge yet."
169,00:09:34.27,00:09:34.27,">> All right, here we go. You ready? This could decide the"
170,00:09:38.47,00:09:38.47,"future. Whoa, wait a second here. We got a lock and keys."
171,00:09:43.07,00:09:43.07,>> SANDRA: One more challenge. I'd take a challenge in a

182,00:10:07.37,00:10:07.37,>> Make some popcorn before we go?
183,00:10:08.93,00:10:08.93,>> I would love to try some of that.
184,00:10:10.67,00:10:10.67,">> SANDRA: On our way back from, uh, the"

187,00:10:18.73,00:10:18.73,"myself and Jon had said, ""Okay, we want the coconut"
188,00:10:21.60,00:10:21.60,"popcorn."" Because once you fry the coconut, it tastes exactly"

192,00:10:30.03,00:10:30.03,"Yeah, we'll cook the next one."
193,00:10:31.13,00:10:31.13,>> We don't have the other one. Let's just do it.

197,00:10:37.83,00:10:37.83,already said. Everyone said. >> You argue about everything.
198,00:10:39.77,00:10:39.77,>> Does Rupert want it cooked? >> Do we have time to sit
199,00:10:41.77,00:10:41.77,here and worry about this ... right now?
200,00:10:43.90,00:10:43.90,>> We wor... We're doing it. You're the only one
201,00:10:45.90,00:10:45.90,working against that. >> Do it.
202,00:10:48.27,00:10:48.27,">> Well, you can help, and that would speed up the process."
203,00:10:51.57,00:10:51.57,">> I don't want to help... >> I know you don't, because"
204,00:10:53.50,00:10:53.50,that's not your decision. >> Are you going to make this

229,00:11:40.50,00:11:40.50,always fighting. I'm glad it's not me. Let them duke
230,00:11:43.50,00:11:43.50,"it out. You know, let them kill each other, vote each"
231,00:11:45.60,00:11:45.60,"other off. As long as it ain't Sandra, I'm happy."
232,00:11:58.63,00:11:58.63,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! 19 days you've been out here"
233,00:12:07.87,00:12:07.87,in the Pearl Islands. You have
234,00:12:09.80,00:12:09.80,"survived the bugs, the lack of food, miserable living"
235,00:12:13.60,00:12:13.60,"conditions, and the ever-shifting tribal dynamics."
236,00:12:16.50,00:12:16.50,"Together, you voted six people out of this game, three from"
237,00:12:21.40,00:12:21.40,"Morgan, three from Drake. The reasons you voted these"
238,00:12:24.37,00:12:24.37,people out varied. The only
239,00:12:25.67,00:12:25.67,real common trait among the six people you voted out is
240,00:12:29.27,00:12:29.27,that they're no longer in this game-- but that may soon
241,00:12:32.87,00:12:32.87,"change. Morgan, Drake, your"
242,00:12:34.60,00:12:34.60,past has come back to haunt you.
243,00:12:38.30,00:12:38.30,"Come on in, guys. >> OSTEN: No way."
244,00:12:45.37,00:12:45.37,>> SANDRA: What's that? >> PROBST: The six people you
245,00:12:51.70,00:12:51.70,have voted outs return now as a third tribe.
246,00:12:57.97,00:12:57.97,"Nicole, Skinny Ryan, Lill, Burton, Michelle and Trish."
247,00:13:08.10,00:13:08.10,Do you guys have a tribe name? >> We're the Outcasts.
248,00:13:10.80,00:13:10.80,>> PROBST: The Outcasts. Not unlike the
249,00:13:14.17,00:13:14.17,"pirate days, they got tired of somebody, felt they were no"
250,00:13:17.30,00:13:17.30,"longer worthy, they shipped them out to sea and left them"
251,00:13:21.00,00:13:21.00,"for dead. Typically, they died,"
252,00:13:22.23,00:13:22.23,"but every so often, they didn't, and when they came"
253,00:13:26.03,00:13:26.03,"back, they usually had one thing on their mind."
254,00:13:28.97,00:13:28.97,I'm guessing it's the same with you. Michelle?
255,00:13:30.73,00:13:30.73,">> Revenge, baby. All about revenge."
256,00:13:58.47,00:13:58.47,">> PROBST: All right, guys. Let's get to it."
257,00:14:01.17,00:14:01.17,Here's how it will work-- the Outcasts will compete against
258,00:14:04.10,00:14:04.10,"Morgan and Drake in a three-tribe challenge, and the"
259,00:14:07.50,00:14:07.50,stakes are severe. If Morgan
260,00:14:10.37,00:14:10.37,"or Drake lose to the Outcast tribe, you will go to Tribal"
261,00:14:14.87,00:14:14.87,Council tonight and you will vote somebody out.
262,00:14:16.43,00:14:16.43,The Outcasts will then go to Tribal Council and vote
263,00:14:19.17,00:14:19.17,somebody in and replace the member you lost.
264,00:14:22.60,00:14:22.60,"If both tribes lose to the Outcasts, you both"
265,00:14:26.33,00:14:26.33,"will go to Tribal-- separately. Both will vote somebody out,"
266,00:14:29.33,00:14:29.33,and two Outcasts will come back into this game.
267,00:14:32.10,00:14:32.10,"In addition, if any Outcast makes it back into this game,"
268,00:14:35.03,00:14:35.03,they are immune at the next Tribal Council to give them
269,00:14:37.67,00:14:37.67,a fair shot at integrating with their new tribe and
270,00:14:40.80,00:14:40.80,"getting back into this game. If the Outcasts kick your ass,"
271,00:14:43.43,00:14:43.43,"you may be going home. On the flip side, if you really"
272,00:14:48.23,00:14:48.23,"are the ten most worthy survivors,"
273,00:14:49.73,00:14:49.73,"this should be no trouble. Drake, Morgan, just so you"
274,00:14:52.13,00:14:52.13,"know, the Outcasts have been living on very limited rations"
275,00:14:55.27,00:14:55.27,"of rice and fruit and protein, just like you."
276,00:14:58.23,00:14:58.23,Okay. Want to know what the challenge is?
277,00:15:01.03,00:15:01.03,ALL: Yeah. >> PROBST: It's a first.
278,00:15:02.40,00:15:02.40,It is a three-tribe challenge. It's a series of rescues.
279,00:15:05.33,00:15:05.33,There are three prisons with three cages in each one.
280,00:15:08.73,00:15:08.73,"Your entire tribe will be locked up, except for one"
281,00:15:11.40,00:15:11.40,"tribe rescuer. On my ""go,"""
282,00:15:13.50,00:15:13.50,rescuers will race to the beach to retrieve their flag. Each
283,00:15:18.07,00:15:18.07,flag is an equal distance from the tribe prison.
284,00:15:20.67,00:15:20.67,"Using your hands, start digging under and into the first cage"
285,00:15:24.40,00:15:24.40,"where you will release your first tribe mate, who's tied"
286,00:15:27.03,00:15:27.03,"up. Together, you will dig into the second cage and"
287,00:15:30.10,00:15:30.10,release two more tribe mates who are also tied up.
288,00:15:33.43,00:15:33.43,"On the ground, you'll find scattered sticks and string."
289,00:15:35.63,00:15:35.63,Use those to build a pole and reach for two keys in
290,00:15:38.97,00:15:38.97,"the third cage, which will unlock that door. Those keys"
291,00:15:42.13,00:15:42.13,"will also unlock the rest of your tribe. Now, everybody's"
292,00:15:44.17,00:15:44.17,in the last cage and you need to get out of that
293,00:15:47.00,00:15:47.00,final door. Use your pole again to retrieve one last
294,00:15:50.80,00:15:50.80,"key from outside the prison. First tribe, with their flag,"
295,00:15:54.33,00:15:54.33,"to cross the finish line wins. For the Outcasts, you're"
296,00:15:59.03,00:15:59.03,fighting to get back in this game.
297,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,"Drake and Morgan, you're fighting to stay alive."
298,00:16:02.40,00:16:02.40,"All right. Select your tribe rescuers. Wait for my ""go."""
299,00:16:08.40,00:16:08.40,"All right, the rescuers you chose for your tribes: Burton"
300,00:16:12.80,00:16:12.80,"for the Outcasts, Andrew for Morgan, Shawn for Drake."
301,00:16:16.10,00:16:16.10,A lot at stake. Survivors ready?

379,00:20:32.50,00:20:32.50,>> Oh! >> PROBST: The Outcasts dropped
380,00:20:34.27,00:20:34.27,their keys. >> Come on. Hold on.
381,00:20:39.43,00:20:39.43,">> No, no, no, Lill, you gotta stay in."
382,00:20:41.20,00:20:41.20,>> Hold on. >> It's okay.
383,00:20:44.33,00:20:44.33,>> PROBST: Morgan and Drake fighting to stay alive.
384,00:20:49.13,00:20:49.13,>> Come on. >> Be careful. Be careful!
385,00:20:51.93,00:20:51.93,Be careful! >> PROBST: Morgan's pole has
386,00:20:54.10,00:20:54.10,"just fallen apart. Outcasts have their keys,"
387,00:20:58.57,00:20:58.57,unlocking the last lock. This could be it.
388,00:21:01.37,00:21:01.37,Drake trying to catch up. The Outcasts working together
389,00:21:04.37,00:21:04.37,"as a tribe, untying the door. >> BURTON: Go!"
390,00:21:06.57,00:21:06.57,>> Get it! Come on! >> PROBST: Everybody's got to
391,00:21:11.50,00:21:11.50,"cross the finish line, got to have the tribe flag."
392,00:21:13.43,00:21:13.43,"( yelling and cheering ) Michelle's through,"
393,00:21:15.17,00:21:15.17,Burton's through. Ryan is through!
394,00:21:17.47,00:21:17.47,The Outcasts defeat Morgan and Drake!
395,00:21:20.70,00:21:20.70,This challenge is over. It's over.
396,00:21:34.67,00:21:34.67,"It's over. (cheering, accolades continue)"
397,00:21:45.73,00:21:45.73,Huge effort by all three tribes. I know there's a lot going on
398,00:21:51.23,00:21:51.23,"emotionally, but for the Outcasts, clearly a big win,"
399,00:21:53.37,00:21:53.37,"terrific opportunity. But let's face it,"
400,00:21:58.17,00:21:58.17,you guys have had your own ups and downs in this game.
401,00:22:01.90,00:22:01.90,"Burton, how big a victory is this?"
402,00:22:03.70,00:22:03.70,">> Revenge is sweet, but... it's been no walk in the park,"
403,00:22:08.33,00:22:08.33,"and you want to talk about being down, man, got kicked"
404,00:22:11.13,00:22:11.13,out of a tribe. Those are the lowest of the
405,00:22:13.20,00:22:13.20,lows. They haven't been there yet.
406,00:22:14.60,00:22:14.60,"So, uh, we faced a lot of adversity and came back"
407,00:22:16.97,00:22:16.97,"stronger than ever. >> PROBST: Okay, here's how"
408,00:22:19.13,00:22:19.13,it's gonna work: Drake... you will come to
409,00:22:22.13,00:22:22.13,"Tribal Council first tonight, you'll vote somebody out."
410,00:22:24.53,00:22:24.53,They will be going home. Morgan...
411,00:22:26.40,00:22:26.40,you will follow them in a separate Tribal Council.
412,00:22:29.97,00:22:29.97,You will vote somebody out. They'll be going home.
413,00:22:33.13,00:22:33.13,"The Outcasts... you'll come in last, you'll vote two people"
414,00:22:37.03,00:22:37.03,"into the game, and they'll report to their new tribes"
415,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,immediately. Make sense?
416,00:22:42.23,00:22:42.23,Head back the way you came. See you at Tribal Council.
417,00:23:21.97,00:23:21.97,>> ANDREW: The game to end all games.
418,00:23:23.77,00:23:23.77,"It's frustrating, it's exhilarating, it's"
419,00:23:25.77,00:23:25.77,"exciting, and it's a pain in the ass."
420,00:23:29.57,00:23:29.57,Those six in the... the misfits... have no right
421,00:23:32.97,00:23:32.97,to be here. >> None. None.
422,00:23:34.07,00:23:34.07,"All right? So I want everyone's word, looking me in"
423,00:23:36.10,00:23:36.10,the eye. Whoever they send
424,00:23:37.53,00:23:37.53,over here is gone the very next opportunity.
425,00:23:39.97,00:23:39.97,We got that? >> RYNO: They got immunity on
426,00:23:41.70,00:23:41.70,the first one. The first one. >> You're kidding.
427,00:23:44.87,00:23:44.87,>> It doesn't matter though. It'll be three on two.
428,00:23:49.07,00:23:49.07,"Bye-bye. >> ANDREW: Well, we need to"
429,00:23:51.40,00:23:51.40,strategize. I don't want any
430,00:23:53.80,00:23:53.80,of those misfits getting any control or authority in our
431,00:23:59.03,00:23:59.03,tribe. >> No. No way. I don't...
432,00:24:00.67,00:24:00.67,">> I don't care about Drake. Anybody that left Morgan,"
433,00:24:02.77,00:24:02.77,there's a damn good reason for it.
434,00:24:04.93,00:24:04.93,Skinny Ryan has no business stepping on this beach again.
435,00:24:07.57,00:24:07.57,Lill-- God bless her-- I love her... she's got no business
436,00:24:10.37,00:24:10.37,"competing in those challenges. >> TIJUANA: For the most part,"
437,00:24:13.17,00:24:13.17,we're all frustrated about the new dynamic to this game.
438,00:24:15.60,00:24:15.60,And it was very obvious that Andrew did not want
439,00:24:18.53,00:24:18.53,this new tribe member to really have a say.
440,00:24:21.27,00:24:21.27,I think that Andrew's very comfortable
441,00:24:22.90,00:24:22.90,being the leader. He's got the
442,00:24:25.53,00:24:25.53,"best seat in the house, um... and I think he wants to keep"
443,00:24:28.00,00:24:28.00,"that. >> Worst-case scenario,"
444,00:24:29.60,00:24:29.60,"we'll vote somebody out tomorrow, and it can't be the"
445,00:24:32.70,00:24:32.70,( bleep ) who joined us. ( groans )
446,00:24:34.13,00:24:34.13,>> I'd be the first one voted off.
447,00:24:37.13,00:24:37.13,"Vote me right off, 'cause I don't deserve to win. Okay?"
448,00:24:39.57,00:24:39.57,You guys stuck it out. Your body could last longer than
449,00:24:43.07,00:24:43.07,mine. Mine couldn't. I'm out of gas. I'm spent.
450,00:24:45.63,00:24:45.63,I couldn't even move in that challenge today.
451,00:24:47.40,00:24:47.40,My temple has got nothing to offer for me.
452,00:24:49.83,00:24:49.83,I'm... I'm a bag of atrophy right now.
453,00:24:52.90,00:24:52.90,"Anybody knows me knows, when I come to play"
454,00:24:55.63,00:24:55.63,"at anything, it's 110%. And, if I can't give that, I'm"
455,00:24:59.93,00:24:59.93,out. I like to win straight
456,00:25:02.13,00:25:02.13,"up, and I can't do that. Number two, I don't really"
457,00:25:04.17,00:25:04.17,give a damn what someone else thinks about me.
458,00:25:05.50,00:25:05.50,If you don't like what I do or what I say or
459,00:25:07.00,00:25:07.00,"what I've done, you can get in line to kiss my ass."
460,00:25:09.80,00:25:09.80,For me to stay any longer just makes me look like a fool.
461,00:25:13.00,00:25:13.00,"And you can cut your losses. You know, you're not going to"
462,00:25:15.27,00:25:15.27,win everything. >> You're sure?
463,00:25:16.87,00:25:16.87,I'm positive. Vote me off. It's been a pleasure.
464,00:25:19.80,00:25:19.80,It's been a pleasure with all you guys.
465,00:25:22.37,00:25:22.37,I just don't have it in the tank anymore.
466,00:25:24.63,00:25:24.63,I don't have it in the tank anymore.
467,00:25:26.77,00:25:26.77,>> TIJUANA: I'm not going to say anything to Osten to make him
468,00:25:29.27,00:25:29.27,stay. He had already
469,00:25:31.20,00:25:31.20,initially thought about quitting quite a while ago.
470,00:25:34.07,00:25:34.07,I had something to say then because I thought he had
471,00:25:36.17,00:25:36.17,"more in him. This time around, I don't... I"
472,00:25:38.33,00:25:38.33,don't have anything to say to Osten.
473,00:25:40.33,00:25:40.33,>> I can't sleep. Every bone in my body is so
474,00:25:42.33,00:25:42.33,"sore. It's... it's unbearable, so..."
475,00:25:44.33,00:25:44.33,You guys been good. >> ANDREW: I think that O.T.
476,00:25:48.07,00:25:48.07,mentally and physically has shut down.
477,00:25:49.70,00:25:49.70,"He wants out, but I feel, given any state of"
478,00:25:53.20,00:25:53.20,"facts, the last thing in the world I would do is quit."
479,00:25:56.90,00:25:56.90,>> That's something he'll have to live with for the rest of his
480,00:25:58.90,00:25:58.90,life. >> And I don't think that
481,00:26:01.10,00:26:01.10,he's going to fully appreciate it until it... it's obviously
482,00:26:03.10,00:26:03.10,too late. >> SANDRA: That was terrible.
483,00:26:20.83,00:26:20.83,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Who would have thought"
484,00:26:24.30,00:26:24.30,they'd come back to haunt us? When I first saw the
485,00:26:27.83,00:26:27.83,"Outcast tribe, I was, like, no way!"
486,00:26:30.63,00:26:30.63,And then to see Burton as their leader-- he's
487,00:26:34.13,00:26:34.13,"so strong-- and everyone, I know, was probably full of"
488,00:26:36.50,00:26:36.50,"anger and energy. Who, do you think, is going to"
489,00:26:39.67,00:26:39.67,come back? >> Burton and Lill.
490,00:26:41.17,00:26:41.17,"If those are the two... You can't assume that, though."
491,00:26:43.77,00:26:43.77,Burton is not going to go down without a fight.
492,00:26:45.67,00:26:45.67,>> I think it'll be Michelle and Lill.
493,00:26:47.30,00:26:47.30,">> You wonder why those guys were so happy about winning,"
494,00:26:49.77,00:26:49.77,it's because they're a bunch of losers that got a second
495,00:26:52.07,00:26:52.07,"chance in life. If you're a winner, you don't"
496,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,"have to go through the second chance, uh, game."
497,00:26:57.13,00:26:57.13,"So, you know, they're used to that-- their entire lives,"
498,00:26:59.67,00:26:59.67,they've been losers. This is no different.
499,00:27:01.60,00:27:01.60,"Well, somebody has to go home."
500,00:27:04.50,00:27:04.50,Who wants to volunteer? Raise your hand right now.
501,00:27:06.50,00:27:06.50,">> Anybody? Hey, don't everybody jump up"
502,00:27:11.83,00:27:11.83,at the same time. Did anybody raise their hand?
503,00:27:14.60,00:27:14.60,>> No. >> RUPERT: I don't feel
504,00:27:16.30,00:27:16.30,vulnerable tonight. I have my three.
505,00:27:18.73,00:27:18.73,I'm not vulnerable tonight. The two other guys
506,00:27:23.40,00:27:23.40,in the tribe are vulnerable. Jon wrote my name down last
507,00:27:26.70,00:27:26.70,"night, and fair is fair. I should write Jon's name down"
508,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63,"tonight, but I haven't decided yet."
509,00:27:31.70,00:27:31.70,">> I mean, both of them I would love to see..."
510,00:27:34.93,00:27:34.93,>> RUPERT: Gone. Both of them are lying their asses off to
511,00:27:37.50,00:27:37.50,us. >> SANDRA: What if you asked
512,00:27:39.10,00:27:39.10,them to give their reasons why they feel right now that they
513,00:27:42.30,00:27:42.30,"should stay,  and see what they say?"
514,00:27:44.27,00:27:44.27,">> They'd both say, ""Because he's a bigger liar."
515,00:27:46.00,00:27:46.00,"Because he's telling you this, he's telling you that."""
516,00:27:47.67,00:27:47.67,">> But ask them. Say, ""We can't decide"
517,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,"on which one of you two will go home, and we want to hear"
518,00:27:52.33,00:27:52.33,"why you should stay."" And let them fight it amongst"
519,00:27:54.60,00:27:54.60,themselves. >> That would be hilarious.
520,00:27:57.60,00:27:57.60,>> You want to? You want to?
521,00:28:00.90,00:28:00.90,"RUPERT: Hey, Jon. I have been talking with the"
522,00:28:04.67,00:28:04.67,"ladies, and I can't decide who I'm voting for."
523,00:28:08.03,00:28:08.03,"I want both of you, if you would, this is your chance to"
524,00:28:10.50,00:28:10.50,sit down and just say why we should keep you.
525,00:28:12.90,00:28:12.90,">> SANDRA: No fighting. Two minutes, 'cause we're"
526,00:28:15.10,00:28:15.10,"leaving in five. >> The way feel it is, you know,"
527,00:28:18.33,00:28:18.33,I feel I've been pretty honest as much as I could be up to
528,00:28:22.40,00:28:22.40,"this point, but, um, Jon, you know, I feel like I can't trust"
529,00:28:25.03,00:28:25.03,him. With the vote for you
530,00:28:26.83,00:28:26.83,"yesterday, with the fact that if we were to go into a merge"
531,00:28:29.70,00:28:29.70,"today and Jon didn't feel that we were all with him, you"
532,00:28:31.97,00:28:31.97,"know, that that could be dangerous for us."
533,00:28:34.10,00:28:34.10,>> Jon thought he had it all in the bag.
534,00:28:36.33,00:28:36.33,He thought he was playing us all and he had this whole game
535,00:28:38.63,00:28:38.63,figured out. >> SHAWN: But I'm
536,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,going to do everything in my power to make sure it's game
537,00:28:42.50,00:28:42.50,"over for him. You know, you"
538,00:28:43.57,00:28:43.57,can't mess with me long before I come back and get you.
539,00:28:45.97,00:28:45.97,">> I feel that, uh, I've... I've shown that I'm loyal to"
540,00:28:48.90,00:28:48.90,"Drake. Um, and I also feel that"
541,00:28:52.83,00:28:52.83,"I'm definitely a much harder worker, so... and I think"
542,00:28:56.13,00:28:56.13,"that's important when it comes to, uh, to everyday living."
543,00:28:58.57,00:28:58.57,>> JON: I know it's between myself and Shawn.
544,00:29:01.53,00:29:01.53,I'm sure Rupert's not happy that I wrote his name on a
545,00:29:03.53,00:29:03.53,"piece of paper last night. But, uh, will he forgive and"
546,00:29:05.53,00:29:05.53,forget? I don't know. We'll see.
547,00:29:27.27,00:29:27.27,">> PROBST: Well, I think the walk in says it all."
548,00:29:30.10,00:29:30.10,"I've never seen you guys this quiet,"
549,00:29:31.93,00:29:31.93,this separated. I know you didn't expect to be
550,00:29:36.50,00:29:36.50,"here again this soon. Rupert, you're already shaking"
551,00:29:39.63,00:29:39.63,your head. >> Two days in a row.
552,00:29:43.37,00:29:43.37,Two days in a row. Never would I
553,00:29:46.67,00:29:46.67,have thought we'd be here two days in a row.
554,00:29:50.07,00:29:50.07,">> PROBST: Christa, what was your reaction at the"
555,00:29:52.70,00:29:52.70,"challenge? >> Oh, it was a little shocking."
556,00:29:56.30,00:29:56.30,"I... I wasn't quite expecting, uh, everybody else"
557,00:29:58.77,00:29:58.77,to show back up. I'm happy
558,00:30:01.00,00:30:01.00,that I really haven't bad-mouthed anybody from our
559,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,own tribe that's over there. >> PROBST: One of the unique
560,00:30:07.43,00:30:07.43,things about today's change of events
561,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,"is, you got to hear from people who've been voted out."
562,00:30:13.17,00:30:13.17,"Burton made a pretty honest comment about, ""You think you're"
563,00:30:16.63,00:30:16.63,down? You don't know down
564,00:30:18.63,00:30:18.63,"until you've been voted out."" Sandra, did that hit you at"
565,00:30:21.53,00:30:21.53,"all as a, ""Wow, I never thought about how these guys have been"
566,00:30:24.13,00:30:24.13,"feeling""? >> Definitely."
567,00:30:25.77,00:30:25.77,"And with those words, you also say, ""Damn, they're going to"
568,00:30:29.60,00:30:29.60,"give it their all and they're going to come back."""
569,00:30:32.07,00:30:32.07,And now I do feel a little bit threatened because the way he
570,00:30:36.20,00:30:36.20,"sounded, he's ready to come back today, so I wouldn't be"
571,00:30:39.33,00:30:39.33,surprised if he walked back into camp.
572,00:30:42.53,00:30:42.53,>> PROBST: Burton? >> Burton.
573,00:30:45.70,00:30:45.70,Burton. >> PROBST: The guy you couldn't
574,00:30:48.90,00:30:48.90,wait get rid of may be coming home to roost again.
575,00:30:51.40,00:30:51.40,">> That's right. >> PROBST: So, what happened"
576,00:30:55.07,00:30:55.07,"when you went back to camp? >> Um, when we"
577,00:30:58.73,00:30:58.73,"got back to camp, um, just before we came out here,"
578,00:31:02.37,00:31:02.37,"Rupert told the guys, ""Okay, you got two minutes apiece."
579,00:31:05.47,00:31:05.47,"Tell us why we should keep you around."" And they said what"
580,00:31:08.40,00:31:08.40,"they had to say and, um, I think we won't make our minds"
581,00:31:12.10,00:31:12.10,"up until we get up there and, uh, cast our vote, so..."
582,00:31:15.57,00:31:15.57,">> PROBST: So, Sandra, is it safe for me, based"
583,00:31:18.30,00:31:18.30,"on what I'm hearing, to draw the conclusion that it is"
584,00:31:22.13,00:31:22.13,Shawn or Jon tonight that is going home?
585,00:31:23.90,00:31:23.90,>> It is Shawn or Jon that's going home tonight.
586,00:31:27.53,00:31:27.53,">> PROBST: Shawn, why not vote you out tonight?"
587,00:31:30.33,00:31:30.33,What are you going to bring to this tribe that's
588,00:31:32.17,00:31:32.17,"crumbling by the moment? >> I'm dedicated to this tribe,"
589,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,and I wish we could just wash the slate from the past and go
590,00:31:39.97,00:31:39.97,"forward as strong as we can, because the only way that this"
591,00:31:43.97,00:31:43.97,tribe is going to be powerful is if we all stick together
592,00:31:47.60,00:31:47.60,"and trust each other no matter what, and I feel that I can be"
593,00:31:50.40,00:31:50.40,"a good part of that. >> PROBST: Jon, convince"
594,00:31:53.20,00:31:53.20,these guys. Why not vote you out tonight?
595,00:31:55.27,00:31:55.27,>> I feel I care more about this tribe than I do myself.
596,00:31:59.00,00:31:59.00,"Uh, I feel that I know how to split a coconut five ways as"
597,00:32:02.53,00:32:02.53,opposed to Shawn. I think I have shown
598,00:32:05.00,00:32:05.00,"tribe loyalty, which, uh, I don't know what, uh, Shawn to"
599,00:32:09.10,00:32:09.10,"be loyal to at all. So, that's pretty much it."
600,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,">> PROBST: With that, it is time to vote."
601,00:32:15.30,00:32:15.30,"Rupert, you're up. >> Jon..."
602,00:32:41.20,00:32:41.20,"you and I know the truth. Basically, you've been"
603,00:32:44.47,00:32:44.47,backstabbing everyone including myself.
604,00:32:52.27,00:32:52.27,>> (bleep) you. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
605,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67,"votes. Once the votes are read,"
606,00:33:18.03,00:33:18.03,the decision is final. The person voted out
607,00:33:20.03,00:33:20.03,will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
608,00:33:22.03,00:33:22.03,I'll read the votes. First vote... Shawn.
609,00:33:38.07,00:33:38.07,"Jon. That's one vote Jon,"
610,00:33:40.57,00:33:40.57,one vote Shawn. Shawn.
611,00:33:46.60,00:33:46.60,"That's two votes Shawn, one vote Jon."
612,00:33:51.50,00:33:51.50,The latest member to be voted out of the Drake
613,00:33:53.60,00:33:53.60,"tribe-- Shawn. That's three votes, that's"
614,00:33:56.60,00:33:56.60,enough. You need to bring me your torch.
615,00:34:07.40,00:34:07.40,"Shawn, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
616,00:34:24.03,00:34:24.03,Maybe tonight you reached your lowest point.
617,00:34:27.03,00:34:27.03,"If it's any consolation, Morgan is up next"
618,00:34:30.20,00:34:30.20,"to vote off one of their own. And soon, you will both have"
619,00:34:32.90,00:34:32.90,new tribe members. What you do
620,00:34:35.90,00:34:35.90,from this point forward will define your destiny in
621,00:34:39.73,00:34:39.73,"this game. Grab your torches,"
622,00:34:41.80,00:34:41.80,head back to camp. I should have seen this one
623,00:34:47.63,00:34:47.63,coming. Jon basically went
624,00:34:49.27,00:34:49.27,back on everything he had told me for the first three
625,00:34:52.70,00:34:52.70,"days, um, about our supposed alliance."
626,00:34:55.53,00:34:55.53,I had hoped that today would have brought a
627,00:34:58.43,00:34:58.43,"merger. Um, things probably"
628,00:34:59.67,00:34:59.67,would have been a lot different and I might have
629,00:35:01.97,00:35:01.97,been able to go a lot further. I don't know.
630,00:35:04.00,00:35:04.00,"What can I say? Game, set, match."
631,00:35:13.87,00:35:13.87,"( thunder crashing ) >> PROBST: Well, Drake has been"
632,00:35:42.90,00:35:42.90,here and gone. They were lucky
633,00:35:45.47,00:35:45.47,"with the weather. Unfortunately, you're not."
634,00:35:47.53,00:35:47.53,Been a while since you guys have been here.
635,00:35:50.17,00:35:50.17,"Had a nice run. Savage,"
636,00:35:52.83,00:35:52.83,what happened when you guys got back to camp?
637,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50,Suddenly you're faced with an unexpected Tribal Council
638,00:35:59.93,00:35:59.93,and you're going to have to vote somebody out.
639,00:36:02.73,00:36:02.73,">> As soon as we get back to camp, Osten"
640,00:36:05.37,00:36:05.37,"steps forward, says that his mind and his body have shut"
641,00:36:08.73,00:36:08.73,"down and that he needs to go. He can't take it another day,"
642,00:36:12.97,00:36:12.97,absolutely insists that we put his name on the parchment and
643,00:36:15.90,00:36:15.90,vote him out tonight. >> PROBST: You had
644,00:36:17.83,00:36:17.83,"enough, Osten? >> Uh, going into"
645,00:36:19.27,00:36:19.27,"this, I was like, ""I'll only go as far as my body will"
646,00:36:22.87,00:36:22.87,"allow me to go."" And right now, my body's done."
647,00:36:25.00,00:36:25.00,Exasperated. Every bone in my body hurts.
648,00:36:29.33,00:36:29.33,I just can't go any further. I'll be more of a liability
649,00:36:34.17,00:36:34.17,"than an asset to my team,and I refuse to do that."
650,00:36:36.77,00:36:36.77,">> PROBST: Savage, how much of this experience"
651,00:36:38.73,00:36:38.73,is about finding out what you are made of?
652,00:36:42.30,00:36:42.30,">> It's all about that, Jeff. It's all mental."
653,00:36:44.90,00:36:44.90,"Your mind controls your body. If your body's shutting down,"
654,00:36:48.33,00:36:48.33,"it's because, in my opinion, it's because your mind's"
655,00:36:50.23,00:36:50.23,"shutting down. >> PROBST: Okay, so, Osten,"
656,00:36:51.60,00:36:51.60,"your body, although it appears to smack anybody's body that's"
657,00:36:55.27,00:36:55.27,"still left in this game, I would argue probably your mind"
658,00:36:58.80,00:36:58.80,"has had enough, as well. So, when you hear a guy"
659,00:37:02.37,00:37:02.37,"like Burton come back and say today, ""You don't know what"
660,00:37:07.03,00:37:07.03,"down is until you've been humiliated by being voted out,"""
661,00:37:09.47,00:37:09.47,and yet he still has a burning desire enough to be back in
662,00:37:13.93,00:37:13.93,"this game that he'll risk it again, is there any part of"
663,00:37:16.43,00:37:16.43,you that questions your own will to go on when your body
664,00:37:20.50,00:37:20.50,"may be saying, ""I'm tired""? >> Absolutely not. I equate my"
665,00:37:23.70,00:37:23.70,"temple to a car. If it has no gas, it cannot run."
666,00:37:25.90,00:37:25.90,">> PROBST: T, from what I gathered at that"
667,00:37:28.53,00:37:28.53,"second Tribal Council, it was Osten who was the mysterious"
668,00:37:31.30,00:37:31.30,"person who wanted to quit. So, this goes back to day five"
669,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,or six. What's going on from
670,00:37:36.93,00:37:36.93,your point of view right now with Osten?
671,00:37:39.47,00:37:39.47,">> Um, I can't dictate to Osten or understand where"
672,00:37:42.30,00:37:42.30,he's coming from. This experience may not be
673,00:37:46.13,00:37:46.13,enough of a sacrifice for him versus his health.
674,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,It is for me. I'm willing to go until
675,00:37:52.47,00:37:52.47,"probably I'm dead here, either that or I'm voted out, but"
676,00:37:55.03,00:37:55.03,"that's just me. >> PROBST: Darrah, I'm"
677,00:37:58.43,00:37:58.43,"watching your body shrink by the day, pulling your top up,"
678,00:38:02.30,00:38:02.30,nothing's staying on Do you want out of this game?
679,00:38:04.73,00:38:04.73,">> No, I do not want out of this game."
680,00:38:06.83,00:38:06.83,"Like T said, you know, I guess you'll have to be"
681,00:38:09.53,00:38:09.53,carrying me away because I'm not going to leave this game
682,00:38:11.93,00:38:11.93,"until I have to. >> PROBST: Ryno, what's"
683,00:38:14.10,00:38:14.10,your take on this happening tonight?
684,00:38:15.73,00:38:15.73,"Is it, ""You know what? Fine, Osten. You've wanted to"
685,00:38:18.40,00:38:18.40,"quit twice. Go home""? >> As far as I'm concerned, if"
686,00:38:21.27,00:38:21.27,"it was me, I'd be clawing and scratching and have to have"
687,00:38:24.17,00:38:24.17,"pneumonia and stuff, but you know, Osten's going to do his"
688,00:38:27.27,00:38:27.27,thing. That's... that's his
689,00:38:28.50,00:38:28.50,wishes. I'm going to grant him
690,00:38:30.40,00:38:30.40,"his wishes. >> PROBST: So, I'm going to"
691,00:38:31.70,00:38:31.70,"go back to you, Osten. I think you know I'm not"
692,00:38:34.27,00:38:34.27,"picking on you. >> Oh, that's"
693,00:38:35.33,00:38:35.33,"fine if you are. >> PROBST: So, when you"
694,00:38:36.73,00:38:36.73,"hear your four other tribe mates, who obviously adore you,"
695,00:38:39.93,00:38:39.93,"when you hear them say, ""I wouldn't quit, not for"
696,00:38:43.80,00:38:43.80,"nothing, Jeff,"" you can't tell me somewhere in the back of"
697,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,"your mind, there's not a little part of you saying, ""I am"

700,00:38:55.03,00:38:55.03,"quitting, you want to say stopping,"
701,00:38:56.43,00:38:56.43,"yeah, I'm quitting. My health"
702,00:38:57.80,00:38:57.80,"to me is more important to me, um, than the million dollars,"
703,00:39:00.97,00:39:00.97,"I guess, right now. Does the"
704,00:39:02.33,00:39:02.33,"mean justify the ends? No, it doesn't."
705,00:39:04.43,00:39:04.43,">> PROBST: Let me ask you something, Osten."
706,00:39:06.37,00:39:06.37,Have you wondered what the hell you're doing out here?
707,00:39:10.00,00:39:10.00,>> You know what? I'm clearly out of my element.
708,00:39:11.93,00:39:11.93,"As a situation, I would have thought that,"

714,00:39:25.37,00:39:25.37,"shaking your head. >> If I were to do this,"
715,00:39:27.37,00:39:27.37,"I would have a ""What if,"" flat out."
716,00:39:30.33,00:39:30.33,What if I went another two days? What if I went one more day?
717,00:39:34.33,00:39:34.33,"I mean, but that's just me. You know, I... I don't pretend"
718,00:39:37.53,00:39:37.53,"to-to walk in his shoes, Jeff. I-I can't understand what"
719,00:39:39.70,00:39:39.70,he's going through. It's his decision.
720,00:39:43.73,00:39:43.73,">> PROBST: Well,  Osten, I don't pretend to know what"
721,00:39:47.33,00:39:47.33,"you're thinking either, but I know this-- I've been at about"
722,00:39:50.30,00:39:50.30,"a hundred Tribal Councils, never ever seen anybody lay down"
723,00:39:54.07,00:39:54.07,their torch. So this is a first for me.
724,00:39:57.27,00:39:57.27,Seems unanimous. I just want to make sure.
725,00:40:00.83,00:40:00.83,"Savage, you're going to indulge Osten, send him home?"
726,00:40:04.47,00:40:04.47,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Darrah?

735,00:40:51.80,00:40:51.80,"his torch down, so it shall be. Who knows?"
736,00:40:55.73,00:40:55.73,Maybe this is the best thing to happen to the Morgan Tribe.
737,00:40:59.07,00:40:59.07,"All I know is, you will head back to camp."
