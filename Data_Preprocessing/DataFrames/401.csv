2,00:00:17.83,00:00:17.83,"fishing trawler Amaryllis, making our way through the very"
3,00:00:20.50,00:00:20.50,rough waters of the South Pacific.
4,00:00:24.10,00:00:24.10,"Down below, deep inside the hold of this ship, 16 Americans,"
5,00:00:27.33,00:00:27.33,"about to be abandoned in the middle of the Marquesas, part of"
6,00:00:30.63,00:00:30.63,Tahiti's mystical islands. Thousands of miles from the
7,00:00:33.90,00:00:33.90,"nearest continent, this will be their home for the next 39 days."
8,00:00:40.13,00:00:40.13,But this time the game is different.
9,00:00:43.40,00:00:43.40,"These survivors will be given no food, absolutely no rations."
10,00:00:48.37,00:00:48.37,Each tribe will leave the ship with only the barest of
11,00:00:51.87,00:00:51.87,"essentials: two machetes, two cooking pots, two empty water"
12,00:00:55.73,00:00:55.73,"containers, one frying pan, one filet knife, and one magnifying"
13,00:00:59.87,00:00:59.87,glass. They'll be left to fend for
14,00:01:02.00,00:01:02.00,themselves using the resources of the land and their own
15,00:01:05.47,00:01:05.47,survival skills. It is the ultimate challenge:
16,00:01:08.60,00:01:08.60,16 strangers forced to work together to create a new society
17,00:01:12.93,00:01:12.93,while battling the elements and each other.
18,00:01:16.03,00:01:16.03,They must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out of the
19,00:01:19.53,00:01:19.53,"tribe. In the end, only one will remain"
20,00:01:22.30,00:01:22.30,to claim the million-dollar prize.
21,00:01:33.87,00:01:33.87,"39 days, 16 people... one survivor."
22,00:02:47.20,00:02:47.20,">> PROBST: As this ship drops anchor, these 16 Americans began"
23,00:02:50.90,00:02:50.90,the adventure of a lifetime. They have never spoken to each
24,00:03:02.07,00:03:02.07,"other, and have been divided into the two competing tribes:"
25,00:03:05.17,00:03:05.17,"Maraamu and Rotu, Tahitian words for ""wind"" and ""rain."""
26,00:03:11.90,00:03:11.90,Each tribe will be given a crate which holds a minimal amount of
27,00:03:16.33,00:03:16.33,"supplies, but no food and no water."
28,00:03:20.13,00:03:20.13,They then face a difficult two- mile paddle to their beaches and
29,00:03:24.37,00:03:24.37,their new homes for the next 39 days.
30,00:03:31.60,00:03:31.60,( shouting ) >> Okay!
31,00:03:37.37,00:03:37.37,>> Woo! >> Let's get away from the boat.
32,00:03:47.87,00:03:47.87,">> Over here. >> PROBST: The Rotu Tribe, which"
33,00:04:01.97,00:04:01.97,"will always wear blue, consists of Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien, a real"

54,00:05:48.00,00:05:48.00,">> Guess what. We haven't moved at all in,"
55,00:05:49.93,00:05:49.93,"like, the last half hour. >> We were making zero progress."
56,00:05:52.63,00:05:52.63,"I don't know how long we were out there, but every one of us"
57,00:05:55.40,00:05:55.40,were totally exhausted. >> I think we're going exactly
58,00:05:57.83,00:05:57.83,".2 miles per hour. >> Okay, don't stop rowing!"
59,00:06:01.23,00:06:01.23,>> One... two...
60,00:06:04.23,00:06:04.23,three... four.
61,00:06:06.43,00:06:06.43,"Over to that cliff. >> Really well, excellent work."
62,00:06:10.70,00:06:10.70,">> Rotu, Rotu. Rotu, Rotu."
63,00:06:12.87,00:06:12.87,">> We were singing and trying to get some sort of rowing motion,"
64,00:06:17.10,00:06:17.10,"you know, like on an old whaler there."
65,00:06:19.63,00:06:19.63,And it really brought us together.
66,00:06:22.57,00:06:22.57,>> ...three... four... five... six... seven...
67,00:06:29.07,00:06:29.07,">> We're getting there. >> ...six, seven, eight."
68,00:06:36.23,00:06:36.23,Woo! We made it!
69,00:06:39.57,00:06:39.57,Can you believe it? >> My first thought when we hit
70,00:06:43.33,00:06:43.33,"the beach was, ""Thank you, God, for letting us hit this beach."""
71,00:06:46.50,00:06:46.50,I was just happy to have made it.
72,00:06:50.23,00:06:50.23,>> Everybody was so psyched. They were just running around
73,00:06:54.37,00:06:54.37,and congratulating each other and we were thrilled.
74,00:06:56.80,00:06:56.80,We made it. We made it the first part of
75,00:06:58.73,00:06:58.73,"the way. >> Wonderful to be here, guys."
76,00:07:01.13,00:07:01.13,>> So our tribe is Rotu! ( cheering )
77,00:07:13.57,00:07:13.57,>> It was great when we rounded that final corner.
78,00:07:16.40,00:07:16.40,"You know, we had seen a lot of coves, and we weren't sure if"
79,00:07:18.83,00:07:18.83,"this was the one. We thought it was the one, and"
80,00:07:21.30,00:07:21.30,then finally to see the flag coming home-- it was great.
81,00:07:24.57,00:07:24.57,( cheering ) Wave the flag!
82,00:07:36.93,00:07:36.93,">> As we were coming in, last maybe 50 yards or so, we all"
83,00:07:40.57,00:07:40.57,"made a concerted effort to give a last heave to make it to land,"
84,00:07:47.60,00:07:47.60,and it was quite evident that Sarah wasn't doing anything at
85,00:07:52.00,00:07:52.00,"all. Stroke, stroke."
86,00:07:55.67,00:07:55.67,"Kick, kick. Kick."
87,00:07:59.87,00:07:59.87,"Stroke, stroke. >> Sarah's arrival was almost"
88,00:08:04.03,00:08:04.03,like Cleopatra. It was like the servants are
89,00:08:07.73,00:08:07.73,paddling and lifting and she's sitting on a crate looking so
90,00:08:12.63,00:08:12.63,marvelous with her boobs hanging out and her Goldilocks in the
91,00:08:18.30,00:08:18.30,air. >> Woo-hoo!
92,00:08:24.23,00:08:24.23,">> Save it, you know? This is Survivor."
93,00:08:26.00,00:08:26.00,Nobody trying to look at you like that here.
94,00:08:28.00,00:08:28.00,>> Home sweet home. >> Yes!
95,00:08:44.83,00:08:44.83,">> When we first arrived on land, I can't even describe it."
96,00:08:48.30,00:08:48.30,"It was beyond words. First of all, I had never been"
97,00:08:52.60,00:08:52.60,"on an ocean, ever. I mean, in the hood, ain't a lot"
98,00:08:55.43,00:08:55.43,"of pools, you know, probably don't really swim too much."
99,00:08:59.07,00:08:59.07,">> How you doing, man? Are you going to make it?"
100,00:09:03.23,00:09:03.23,>> It's emotional when I think about the miracles that God has
101,00:09:06.60,00:09:06.60,performed for me. We didn't do this on our own.
102,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,He definitely... his Hand was under the raft guiding us.
103,00:09:12.40,00:09:12.40,"God, we thank you. We is in the ocean."
104,00:09:16.33,00:09:16.33,"And you led us here, God. >> Sean and Peter immediately"
105,00:09:20.93,00:09:20.93,bonded. They went into the water and
106,00:09:23.23,00:09:23.23,they had their prayer Baptism revival.
107,00:09:25.67,00:09:25.67,>> We can do all things through Christ.
108,00:09:27.83,00:09:27.83,>> This told me that either Sean and Peter were either really
109,00:09:31.13,00:09:31.13,"playing the game starting real early, or they were definitely"
110,00:09:34.47,00:09:34.47,"off their rockers. >> All these things, we pray,"
111,00:09:37.43,00:09:37.43,"for your son, Jesus Christ, Amen."
112,00:09:45.37,00:09:45.37,>> You guys ready to look in the box?
113,00:09:47.33,00:09:47.33,>> Let's go do the box! >> Yeah!
114,00:09:51.13,00:09:51.13,">> Woo! We got it! >> Oh, it's not as much as we"
115,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,thought! >> Our crate had no food.
116,00:10:01.13,00:10:01.13,No food at all. >> I had no idea that this would
117,00:10:05.67,00:10:05.67,"be like this out here. But I mean, we're here."
118,00:10:08.20,00:10:08.20,"We know we have to survive and it's tough, so we just do"
119,00:10:11.23,00:10:11.23,"whatever we can. >> Hey, hey, what's this?"
120,00:10:13.50,00:10:13.50,">> Hey, hey, hey. >> All right, what's this?"
121,00:10:15.87,00:10:15.87,>> Must be a map. A water map.
122,00:10:18.70,00:10:18.70,>> The stuff that was in the crate-- we got a map to our
123,00:10:22.13,00:10:22.13,"water spot. We got, like, two pots and a"
124,00:10:24.63,00:10:24.63,"pan, two machetes and a small knife, and then a magnifying"
125,00:10:28.30,00:10:28.30,glass. >> Woo!
126,00:10:29.77,00:10:29.77,">> Oh, my God. >> Woo!"
127,00:10:31.77,00:10:31.77,>> Let's get going. Let's build a fire.
128,00:10:33.93,00:10:33.93,">> All right, we need tinder. >> We were soaking wet and we"
129,00:10:37.30,00:10:37.30,"had a limited amount of daylight left, so our first thing was to"
130,00:10:40.93,00:10:40.93,get fire. >> Keep doing what you're doing.
131,00:10:52.47,00:10:52.47,Good job. It's working.
132,00:11:00.10,00:11:00.10,>> We landed so late. The sun was down;
133,00:11:03.03,00:11:03.03,the clouds were up. >> Oh...
134,00:11:07.97,00:11:07.97,">> That's a lot of cloud, too. >> I mean we tried and tried and"
135,00:11:11.53,00:11:11.53,"tried, and it just didn't work. >> This is not going to work."
136,00:11:14.87,00:11:14.87,">> Okay. >> And Kathy, she's like, ""We"
137,00:11:16.97,00:11:16.97,"have to have fire and we have to have it right now."""
138,00:11:19.83,00:11:19.83,"So we tried the ""two pieces of wood"" method."
139,00:11:27.90,00:11:27.90,">> Yeah, yeah, man! This is not going to work."
140,00:11:31.27,00:11:31.27,>> Okay. >> Kathy slips very easily into
141,00:11:36.07,00:11:36.07,the role of the skipper. Maybe it's her personality.
142,00:11:40.17,00:11:40.17,Maybe it's the difficulty of being out here.
143,00:11:42.67,00:11:42.67,I don't know. But we didn't need a skipper.
144,00:11:45.00,00:11:45.00,">> All right, well, let's just rotate."
145,00:11:47.03,00:11:47.03,"All right, I'll be right back. >> We have been rotating."
146,00:11:53.30,00:11:53.30,>> Keep going. Come on. Good.
147,00:11:57.03,00:11:57.03,"Go, Johnny, go. >> We were plowing, plowing,"
148,00:12:01.23,00:12:01.23,"plowing and after rolling for all those hours, our arms were"
149,00:12:04.90,00:12:04.90,just spent. >> No.
150,00:12:09.13,00:12:09.13,">> So we didn't get fire the first day, which sucked."
151,00:12:29.70,00:12:29.70,>> I definitely knew this game was going to be hard when we got
152,00:12:32.17,00:12:32.17,here and there was no food. There was nothing in the box.
153,00:12:34.40,00:12:34.40,>> What's in there? We knew that if we didn't work
154,00:12:36.40,00:12:36.40,"as a team, one of us was going to starve to death."
155,00:12:38.60,00:12:38.60,>> What's in this? >> That's a magnifying glass.
156,00:12:40.63,00:12:40.63,>> If that's a magnifying glass we got about an hour to collect
157,00:12:43.33,00:12:43.33,some wood and start a fire. >> Hunter's leadership role
158,00:12:45.90,00:12:45.90,"started when we got here. You know, immediately Hunter"
159,00:12:48.67,00:12:48.67,"said we needed to, you know, stake out where we want to put"
160,00:12:51.67,00:12:51.67,"the fire. >> Hey, you guys?"
161,00:12:54.67,00:12:54.67,"We got a magnifying glass, so if we can collect a ton of"
162,00:12:56.97,00:12:56.97,"firewood, we have only got about an hour and a half, two hours"
163,00:12:59.50,00:12:59.50,left. >> I'm already in love with
164,00:13:01.40,00:13:01.40,Hunter. He's a great person.
165,00:13:03.03,00:13:03.03,We have so much in common. Hunter knows a little bit about
166,00:13:06.70,00:13:06.70,everything. >> I think the prevailing wind
167,00:13:08.83,00:13:08.83,is going to probably switch and come from this direction.
168,00:13:11.47,00:13:11.47,">> ""The prevailing wind""? This is the weather station over"
169,00:13:15.93,00:13:15.93,"here? >> I know you mean well, but you"
170,00:13:18.10,00:13:18.10,"sound like, ""a little bit of wind flowing to the east, but in"
171,00:13:21.67,00:13:21.67,"the morning when we wake up, the sun will be up."""
172,00:13:24.53,00:13:24.53,"My nickname for Hunter is MacGyver, simply because he got"
173,00:13:28.57,00:13:28.57,way too much energy for me out here.
174,00:13:31.13,00:13:31.13,>> You know what I was thinking? If we can get some of the banana
175,00:13:34.40,00:13:34.40,"leaves, and if it starts to rain, we have the banana leaf"
176,00:13:37.27,00:13:37.27,"funnel. >> You can drink rainwater,"
177,00:13:39.07,00:13:39.07,right? >> Out here he's going to turn
178,00:13:40.93,00:13:40.93,"into MacGyver. Everybody, let's make a funnel"
179,00:13:43.20,00:13:43.20,out of a banana plant so in the morning we can get the
180,00:13:45.97,00:13:45.97,"nutrients, because the winds will be blowing to the east."
181,00:13:48.87,00:13:48.87,>> I see that Hunter is starting to be a focal point where
182,00:13:51.80,00:13:51.80,everybody is going to check with him first.
183,00:13:54.00,00:13:54.00,"I'm a alpha male, too, so I find it hard to just follow somebody"
184,00:13:57.57,00:13:57.57,just blindly and keep going like they're my daddy.
185,00:14:00.53,00:14:00.53,"I'm not going to do that. They better know, I'm from"
186,00:14:03.40,00:14:03.40,Harlem and I'm representing. >> We got 40 minutes and that
187,00:14:07.27,00:14:07.27,"sun is behind the mountain. >> Sometimes the angle, the tilt"
188,00:14:14.27,00:14:14.27,of the lens. Tilt it a little bit.
189,00:14:16.60,00:14:16.60,Okay. That's a good one.
190,00:14:27.10,00:14:27.10,">> So I mean, it's so close. I tried my best for 15 minutes"
191,00:14:30.03,00:14:30.03,"and actually, we got some smoke. We got some good smoke."
192,00:14:32.90,00:14:32.90,We just couldn't get it completely going.
193,00:14:37.07,00:14:37.07,>> The problem in lighting the fire is having maintain an air
194,00:14:41.40,00:14:41.40,"flow to keep it going. >> Peter, we need you over here."
195,00:14:44.67,00:14:44.67,>> We got to have someone blowing.
196,00:14:47.90,00:14:47.90,"People know that I'm into yoga. You know, I did that about ten"
197,00:14:51.43,00:14:51.43,"years ago, and in yoga, you breathe from the diaphragm, so I"
198,00:14:54.83,00:14:54.83,"was able to take nice, long, deep breaths."
199,00:14:57.23,00:14:57.23,( blowing ) >> Yeah!
200,00:15:04.63,00:15:04.63,>> Come on. >> Woo-hoo!
201,00:15:08.80,00:15:08.80,>> Yoga definitely helps with lighting the fire.
202,00:15:11.70,00:15:11.70,>> We got fire! >> Here we go.
203,00:15:13.30,00:15:13.30,>> Keep the fuel up. Keep the fuel up.
204,00:15:15.40,00:15:15.40,Don't let it go out. >> Let's not let it go out.
205,00:15:21.60,00:15:21.60,>> Robert rocks! ( chattering )
206,00:15:42.50,00:15:42.50,>> I want a monkey if I win any amount of money.
207,00:15:45.17,00:15:45.17,I want a monkey. You want a monkey too?
208,00:15:48.20,00:15:48.20,>> Yeah. You want a little curious
209,00:15:50.83,00:15:50.83,George? >> Sarah has a very cute body.
210,00:15:53.80,00:15:53.80,"She paid a lot for it. And if you have it, of course"
211,00:15:58.50,00:15:58.50,flaunt it. I do not think that Sarah is
212,00:16:07.17,00:16:07.17,"using her body to get through this game, but I do think that"
213,00:16:10.53,00:16:10.53,"if she connects with the right individual, then that will"
214,00:16:13.73,00:16:13.73,definitely help her get through. >> I want to go look at the bed.
215,00:16:16.97,00:16:16.97,I didn't get to check it out. >> Who is going to sleep inside
216,00:16:21.00,00:16:21.00,this? >> I don't got my shoes on.
217,00:16:22.93,00:16:22.93,>> Right on top of it. >> I thought we were going to
218,00:16:25.87,00:16:25.87,sleep in there. Is it comfy?
219,00:16:27.53,00:16:27.53,">> Oh, yeah, it's like a waterbed."
220,00:16:30.80,00:16:30.80,>> Oh! >> You all right?
221,00:16:32.43,00:16:32.43,">> Oh, dude, I can go to sleep right now."
222,00:16:35.33,00:16:35.33,>> Last night there was definitely flirtation around Rob
223,00:16:38.13,00:16:38.13,and Sarah. >> We fill this thing up and let
224,00:16:40.37,00:16:40.37,it cook in the sun all day tomorrow...
225,00:16:41.80,00:16:41.80,>> There you go. >> We got a hot tub.
226,00:16:43.50,00:16:43.50,">> That's an idea. >> Yeah, or just a little"
227,00:16:45.60,00:16:45.60,"swimming pool, or whatever. >> Get some cocktails, too."
228,00:16:48.77,00:16:48.77,You'll figure out a way. >> When we got into the raft
229,00:16:52.43,00:16:52.43,that we had paddled in on and they kind of just hung out away
230,00:16:56.30,00:16:56.30,"from everybody else, and were there pretty much the whole darn"
231,00:17:00.33,00:17:00.33,"night. So at that point in time, that"
232,00:17:02.37,00:17:02.37,"was another question"" what are they saying, you know?"
233,00:17:05.20,00:17:05.20,Are they flirting or are they making an alliance?
234,00:17:07.83,00:17:07.83,And you shouldn't put yourself in that situation if you don't
235,00:17:10.83,00:17:10.83,want people to think that. >> Anybody have any water?
236,00:17:30.97,00:17:30.97,>> Are these all empty? >> Yeah.
237,00:17:32.97,00:17:32.97,">> Oh, my gosh. >> That's five."
238,00:17:34.93,00:17:34.93,>> When we first landed on the island we knew we were going to
239,00:17:37.63,00:17:37.63,run out of water in a hurry. We each had one coconut full of
240,00:17:40.27,00:17:40.27,"water, which is about a liter, and you really need a gallon a"
241,00:17:43.40,00:17:43.40,"day. >> Well, if we follow the river"
242,00:17:45.50,00:17:45.50,up we get to a little stream there.
243,00:17:47.53,00:17:47.53,>> That's a good idea. >> ( whistles )
244,00:17:50.50,00:17:50.50,"Hey, you guys! This is the way."
245,00:17:52.87,00:17:52.87,I found the way. I did not want to go into this
246,00:17:56.83,00:17:56.83,being the blond bitchy person at all 'cause I'm really not.
247,00:18:01.73,00:18:01.73,The only time I do get assertive is when I see that a critical
248,00:18:05.77,00:18:05.77,job isn't getting done. Is that primeval or what?
249,00:18:16.30,00:18:16.30,It's incredible. >> There's a waterfall!
250,00:18:19.90,00:18:19.90,>> Are you kidding me? Woo!
251,00:18:21.63,00:18:21.63,"Start swimming, baby. >> Go, go, go."
252,00:18:25.03,00:18:25.03,">> We were so excited when we found that waterfall, like, I"
253,00:18:28.10,00:18:28.10,saw it for the first time and I could not believe my eyes.
254,00:18:31.13,00:18:31.13,">> Oh, my God! >> Woo!"
255,00:18:33.87,00:18:33.87,">> Come on, guys! >> I was like, this is awesome!"
256,00:18:39.10,00:18:39.10,>> You tell me there's not a god.
257,00:18:50.87,00:18:50.87,">> I don't want to go home. >> That waterfall was just, ah,"
258,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43,"it was like sanctuary. Damn, I think it's taro."
259,00:18:58.60,00:18:58.60,"We found a ton of taro, so we got food; we got water."
260,00:19:02.07,00:19:02.07,"These surroundings will give you everything, so you've gotta be"
261,00:19:06.13,00:19:06.13,"close to Mother Earth now. If you never were before, now's"
262,00:19:09.50,00:19:09.50,the time. >> Now that we found this
263,00:19:12.47,00:19:12.47,"waterfall, it's dynamite, and then it's just the fire, that"
264,00:19:15.40,00:19:15.40,damn fire. So I'm just going to work on the
265,00:19:17.50,00:19:17.50,fire when we get back. I'm going to work on it until
266,00:19:20.07,00:19:20.07,it's dark. >> Stop.
267,00:19:28.37,00:19:28.37,">> Oh, there it goes. Oh, sweet!"
268,00:19:29.60,00:19:29.60,">> This is grapefruit, right? It smells like grapefruit."
269,00:19:31.83,00:19:31.83,When we open it up we can tell because we'll know what it looks
270,00:19:34.37,00:19:34.37,"like. >> Everybody, a toast."
271,00:19:45.73,00:19:45.73,Cheers! To Maraamu.
272,00:19:48.83,00:19:48.83,>> Maraamu! >> When I first arrived here I
273,00:19:52.87,00:19:52.87,"realized that we had no food at all, and I didn't want to be"
274,00:19:57.20,00:19:57.20,eating lemons and grapefruits the entire time we're here.
275,00:20:01.80,00:20:01.80,( rooster crowing ) Did you hear that?
276,00:20:04.93,00:20:04.93,"Listen, can you hear that gobbling?"
277,00:20:07.37,00:20:07.37,Sounds like a turkey. Do you hear it?
278,00:20:09.57,00:20:09.57,I'm being dead serious. I don't know if chickens make
279,00:20:13.00,00:20:13.00,that sound too. So I decided that I would try to
280,00:20:16.50,00:20:16.50,get some meat for us. There are chickens and pigs in
281,00:20:21.07,00:20:21.07,"this area. Yo, yo, yo, don't move."
282,00:20:23.93,00:20:23.93,There's a chicken. I swear to God.
283,00:20:44.20,00:20:44.20,"He's got to come down, right? He's right up there."
284,00:20:47.77,00:20:47.77,">> That thing is huge! >> Dude, that is dinner right"
285,00:20:50.77,00:20:50.77,"there. Come on, we've got to get him"
286,00:20:52.73,00:20:52.73,down. I'll grab him and just snap him.
287,00:20:56.60,00:20:56.60,"Roosters can't fly, can they? >> I had no idea that roosters"
288,00:21:06.10,00:21:06.10,can fly. But this rooster took off like a
289,00:21:09.57,00:21:09.57,747. He was out of there.
290,00:21:11.60,00:21:11.60,And that was it. >> Did you get him?
291,00:21:15.10,00:21:15.10,"Come on, chicken man. Did you get him?"
292,00:21:17.23,00:21:17.23,>> No. I know.
293,00:21:18.53,00:21:18.53,I will. >> At times Rob is a little
294,00:21:22.00,00:21:22.00,preoccupied with things that don't really pertain to the
295,00:21:24.90,00:21:24.90,"survival needs of the moment. He wants to chase chickens, I"
296,00:21:27.53,00:21:27.53,"mean, I don't even think he knows how to clean a chicken."
297,00:21:29.67,00:21:29.67,>> Maybe I don't have as much experience as you guys do with
298,00:21:33.60,00:21:33.60,what needs to be done. >> That's why I was getting a
299,00:21:36.43,00:21:36.43,"little frustrated because if we collect a lot of firewood, if we"
300,00:21:39.40,00:21:39.40,"get the water going, if we finish the shelter, once we've"
301,00:21:42.03,00:21:42.03,"got all those things, then we do the luxury items."
302,00:21:44.37,00:21:44.37,>> Hunter felt that I was spending too much time trying to
303,00:21:48.00,00:21:48.00,hunt down meat and I needed to be around helping with the daily
304,00:21:51.93,00:21:51.93,chores. One down.
305,00:21:55.87,00:21:55.87,I realized that I'm going to have to work hard...
306,00:21:59.07,00:21:59.07,"Two down. ...to stay in the group now, and"
307,00:22:01.87,00:22:01.87,that this is essentially going to be my fate.
308,00:22:09.50,00:22:09.50,>> It's so important to get fire.
309,00:22:11.27,00:22:11.27,"This is the most important thing right now, so we need to get"
310,00:22:14.50,00:22:14.50,a... >> But yesterday...
311,00:22:15.63,00:22:15.63,>> We spent how many hours with that thing yesterday?
312,00:22:18.20,00:22:18.20,I'm wiped. >> How many hours did we spend
313,00:22:20.57,00:22:20.57,yesterday? >> You tell me.
314,00:22:22.13,00:22:22.13,">> Not many, I don't think we spend more than two."
315,00:22:24.03,00:22:24.03,>> Of course we know we have to get fire.
316,00:22:25.87,00:22:25.87,"But to have somebody, you know, ""The sky is falling!"
317,00:22:28.27,00:22:28.27,"The sky is falling!,"" it really started to become grating."
318,00:22:30.93,00:22:30.93,>> I am not trying to be pushy here.
319,00:22:32.53,00:22:32.53,">> No, no, no, I'm not saying you are."
320,00:22:34.23,00:22:34.23,">> Okay, but our problem is huge."
321,00:22:35.73,00:22:35.73,>> I'm saying right now I can't do that.
322,00:22:37.53,00:22:37.53,">> Right, I'm not asking you to do it."
323,00:22:39.17,00:22:39.17,">> You are asking. You're saying ""It's imperative."
324,00:22:41.33,00:22:41.33,"We've got to get dynamic, blah, blah, blah."""
325,00:22:43.27,00:22:43.27,I'm just telling you I'm really tired.
326,00:22:44.90,00:22:44.90,>> I'm not asking you to do it. >> This isn't going to solve
327,00:22:47.53,00:22:47.53,anything here. >> I don't have any support
328,00:22:50.07,00:22:50.07,here. And I'm frustrated that these
329,00:22:52.50,00:22:52.50,people are being more cautious about this.
330,00:22:56.77,00:22:56.77,>> I just don't like the urgency.
331,00:22:58.40,00:22:58.40,"You know, it's like, I'm working my butt off and just getting all"
332,00:23:01.73,00:23:01.73,panicky and stuff is frustrating.
333,00:23:03.40,00:23:03.40,>> I'm Irish so I have that Irish temper and she sparked it
334,00:23:06.60,00:23:06.60,and I did feel bad about it. So then now I became fixated on
335,00:23:10.37,00:23:10.37,getting the fire to basically neutralize my outburst.
336,00:23:14.07,00:23:14.07,"So I was like, ""Damn it. I'm starting a fire."""
337,00:23:17.77,00:23:17.77,">> Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet! >> Oh, we're not even getting"
338,00:23:20.57,00:23:20.57,full sun. You're going to get full sun in
339,00:23:22.60,00:23:22.60,a second. Keep it going.
340,00:23:23.77,00:23:23.77,You're going to get a big old blast.
341,00:23:25.53,00:23:25.53,">> Oh, wow, there we go, baby. Here, sun, sun, sun."
342,00:23:34.23,00:23:34.23,>> Nice. Yeah!
343,00:23:35.60,00:23:35.60,>> Thank you! >> Yes!
344,00:23:38.77,00:23:38.77,>> Fire! >> Yeah!
345,00:23:44.50,00:23:44.50,">> You knew if you left those kids alone for a few minutes,"
346,00:23:47.50,00:23:47.50,"we could do something right. >> Once we had the fire, then"
347,00:23:56.27,00:23:56.27,"everything was forgotten, and she really started to come"
348,00:23:59.60,00:23:59.60,"around with a personality, and attempting to bond."
349,00:24:02.67,00:24:02.67,">> We got fire, girlfriend. I know it was important with"
350,00:24:05.70,00:24:05.70,you. >> Kathy.
351,00:24:07.63,00:24:07.63,"No, no. You put the fire under my butt,"
352,00:24:10.70,00:24:10.70,you take it. >> The nectar of gods.
353,00:24:22.77,00:24:22.77,>> I think it's those two coconut trees right there.
354,00:24:27.07,00:24:27.07,See? Large boulder.
355,00:24:28.50,00:24:28.50,>> That's where we have to get the water from.
356,00:24:30.20,00:24:30.20,">> Water, I wonder if we can go up this giant creek?"
357,00:24:32.37,00:24:32.37,We're going to go hike up to the water source.
358,00:24:34.33,00:24:34.33,Go check it out. >> We got a little bit of an
359,00:24:36.00,00:24:36.00,"adventure, but the big thing is we need to get the water so we"
360,00:24:38.37,00:24:38.37,can start tackling all the other things without getting
361,00:24:40.47,00:24:40.47,dehydrated. >> Do you think we go up more?
362,00:24:45.83,00:24:45.83,">> No, no, this is it. We done looked."
363,00:24:47.90,00:24:47.90,This is it. >> All right!
364,00:24:49.40,00:24:49.40,Agua. And it bubbled up.
365,00:24:50.77,00:24:50.77,This is the beginning of it. See it bubbling over there?
366,00:24:55.77,00:24:55.77,">> Oh, that looks nice. >> Oh, yeah, we got water."
367,00:25:01.03,00:25:01.03,Where's the other one? Mountain spring.
368,00:25:04.43,00:25:04.43,Here. >> It was a huge relief that
369,00:25:06.27,00:25:06.27,"there was actually water there because it's the dry season now,"
370,00:25:09.30,00:25:09.30,"so we were excited, got our water, came back to the fire and"
371,00:25:12.23,00:25:12.23,immediately started boiling. >> I'm a workaholic anyhow.
372,00:25:28.93,00:25:28.93,I caught myself trying to do too much.
373,00:25:30.80,00:25:30.80,"You know, everyone is trying to put their best face forward and"
374,00:25:33.87,00:25:33.87,"trying to show that they're an integral part of the team, and"
375,00:25:39.17,00:25:39.17,"all of a sudden I realized that I had to just, like, slow down."
376,00:25:47.37,00:25:47.37,Then I went over and talked to Sean.
377,00:25:49.43,00:25:49.43,"Sean was great, you know. He's telling me to chill."
378,00:25:52.37,00:25:52.37,">> Man, this feels so good. >> Are you chilling all?"
379,00:25:55.40,00:25:55.40,">> Under the shade, something with some support."
380,00:26:00.10,00:26:00.10,We're chilling. Right?
381,00:26:01.20,00:26:01.20,Isn't that what we're doing? >> We're chilling.
382,00:26:03.87,00:26:03.87,You got to tell me some Harlem stuff.
383,00:26:06.17,00:26:06.17,I want to go back and... >> Harlem stuff?
384,00:26:08.87,00:26:08.87,"That's not Harlem stuff, man. Well, give me some stuff to work"
385,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,"with, for God's sakes! >> Where you going to use it?"
386,00:26:16.23,00:26:16.23,"Where you going to use, uh... You going to walk up to a"
387,00:26:18.67,00:26:18.67,"brother and go ""Hey, I'm chilling."""
388,00:26:20.20,00:26:20.20,">> We talked and he almost, for me, reminded me simply of, you"
389,00:26:24.17,00:26:24.17,"know, and it's really comfortable to be yourself."
390,00:26:27.27,00:26:27.27,Then all of a sudden different tribe members came over and like
391,00:26:31.30,00:26:31.30,we were having a real conversation.
392,00:26:33.53,00:26:33.53,And it's nice to have real conversation with people.
393,00:26:36.40,00:26:36.40,If someone said... all this la-di-da and it's
394,00:26:44.63,00:26:44.63,"simply to master every hole in your body, how you breathe, how"
395,00:26:50.17,00:26:50.17,"you speak, how you see, how you hear, how you urinate, how you"
396,00:26:55.77,00:26:55.77,"go to the bathroom and until you are aware of even that, most"
397,00:27:00.67,00:27:00.67,people around aren't even aware they have seven holes in their
398,00:27:03.90,00:27:03.90,"head. >> He looks like a normal guy,"
399,00:27:05.90,00:27:05.90,"you know, but he's going on and on about being holy."
400,00:27:08.90,00:27:08.90,"And I'm thinking he's talking about spiritualness, but he's"
401,00:27:12.20,00:27:12.20,talking about actual holes in your body.
402,00:27:14.43,00:27:14.43,"I mean, he's a Froot Loop. >> The holes of your"
403,00:27:20.03,00:27:20.03,"elimination, people don't like to talk about it, but, it's"
404,00:27:22.87,00:27:22.87,"really, I mean, if you want to be holy, you might as well start"
405,00:27:25.97,00:27:25.97,with becoming aware. >> Of your holes.
406,00:27:27.90,00:27:27.90,Holy. Holy.
407,00:27:28.50,00:27:28.50,">> All right, I've had enough of this conversation."
408,00:27:31.30,00:27:31.30,>> Then you're aware of what you're saying to people.
409,00:27:34.27,00:27:34.27,">> I don't understand what you're talking about, not one"
410,00:27:37.37,00:27:37.37,"thing. All of a sudden I loosen up, you"
411,00:27:39.53,00:27:39.53,"know, be yourself. Sean did it to me."
412,00:27:41.57,00:27:41.57,"I'm chilling here. >> Ho, ho, ho!"
413,00:27:53.83,00:27:53.83,"Oh, my, our first mail. >> We got mail!"
414,00:27:56.27,00:27:56.27,>> Should we all open it together?
415,00:27:58.00,00:27:58.00,">> Yeah, here we go. Ooh!"
416,00:28:01.33,00:28:01.33,What is it? It's a message on a...
417,00:28:03.00,00:28:03.00,">> Oh, crap, we're going to have to row some more."
418,00:28:05.50,00:28:05.50,">> Oh, no! On the water?"
419,00:28:08.00,00:28:08.00,>> All right. Ready?
420,00:28:10.10,00:28:10.10,"Read it out loud. >> ""You'll be in over your head"
421,00:28:13.20,00:28:13.20,to get to the flame. The weak ones will dread the
422,00:28:16.33,00:28:16.33,thought of this game. It's a long tough trail.
423,00:28:19.30,00:28:19.30,"Avoid a rocky start. Fail to work as a team,"
424,00:28:22.10,00:28:22.10,you'll be the first to part. >> Ooh.
425,00:28:40.60,00:28:40.60,">> PROBST: Welcome. How was the journey over, Sean?"
426,00:28:43.17,00:28:43.17,">> Ha, y'all are crazy. ( laughter )"
427,00:28:46.07,00:28:46.07,>> PROBST: Anybody have any luck with fire?
428,00:28:48.73,00:28:48.73,>> Yeah! ( applause )
429,00:28:49.97,00:28:49.97,">> PROBST: Good, because in addition to no food, no water,"
430,00:28:53.40,00:28:53.40,you're getting no fire help from us at all of any kind at any
431,00:28:56.50,00:28:56.50,"time. That means if you have fire,"
432,00:28:58.47,00:28:58.47,"treasure it, take care of it. When it rains, you better have a"
433,00:29:01.87,00:29:01.87,backup plan. There's no matches coming.
434,00:29:04.23,00:29:04.23,"This is what you want to covet. Everybody, put your hand on"
435,00:29:09.10,00:29:09.10,"that. Everybody, get a little hand on"
436,00:29:11.37,00:29:11.37,this immunity idol. >> Yeah!
437,00:29:13.07,00:29:13.07,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: It is your first
438,00:29:15.93,00:29:15.93,"immunity challenge. Win it, your tribe is guaranteed"
439,00:29:18.33,00:29:18.33,another three days on the island.
440,00:29:19.97,00:29:19.97,"Lose, your tribe is going right there, Tribal Council, somebody"
441,00:29:22.83,00:29:22.83,is going to be the first person voted out.
442,00:29:24.77,00:29:24.77,That brings us to today's challenge.
443,00:29:27.07,00:29:27.07,Here's how it works. Each tribe has an outrigger
444,00:29:29.37,00:29:29.37,"canoe outfitted with two torches, so you're looking at"
445,00:29:32.00,00:29:32.00,"about 300 pounds right now dry. On my ""Go,"" you're going to take"
446,00:29:35.03,00:29:35.03,"your canoe, run down the beach and then swim with it out in the"
447,00:29:37.97,00:29:37.97,"ocean to the center wok, where you will light both of your"
448,00:29:40.63,00:29:40.63,torches. Treasure those torches.
449,00:29:41.93,00:29:41.93,They're very important because you're going to turn around and
450,00:29:44.40,00:29:44.40,start lighting your woks-- four-- as you make your way back
451,00:29:46.77,00:29:46.77,"toward the beach. Once you get to the beach, it's"
452,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.20,a sprint down a very uneven and very rocky beach where you will
453,00:29:52.67,00:29:52.67,"light three more torches. First tribe to reach the end,"
454,00:29:55.80,00:29:55.80,"get their canoe back in the stand, and then light the final"
455,00:29:59.30,00:29:59.30,"wok, wins immunity. You guys ready for this?"
456,00:30:01.53,00:30:01.53,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Get ready to start.
457,00:30:03.53,00:30:03.53,"Wait for my ""Go."" This is for immunity."
458,00:30:08.67,00:30:08.67,Survivors ready! Go!
459,00:30:17.20,00:30:17.20,"( shouting ) >> High, high, high, high, high."
460,00:30:22.30,00:30:22.30,"Up, up. ( shouting )"
461,00:30:27.40,00:30:27.40,>> We got somebody down. >> Please do not tip the boat!
462,00:31:10.07,00:31:10.07,"If this gets water in it, we are screwed."
463,00:31:23.30,00:31:23.30,Light it up there. Light it again!
464,00:31:28.73,00:31:28.73,"Hurry. >> Hurry up, hurry up!"
465,00:31:41.20,00:31:41.20,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Woo!
466,00:32:37.87,00:32:37.87,">> Put the torch back. >> No need, no need."
467,00:32:41.33,00:32:41.33,>> They're going to be coming through the same way.
468,00:32:43.73,00:32:43.73,>> Someone get the last one. ( shouting indistinctly )
469,00:33:04.00,00:33:04.00,">> Woo! >> PROBST: Rotu, immunity."
470,00:33:18.00,00:33:18.00,Who wants it? You guys are safe for three more
471,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,"days. Unfortunately, one of you guys"
472,00:33:26.27,00:33:26.27,are going home tomorrow night. We have a day till Tribal
473,00:33:28.93,00:33:28.93,Council. Good effort.
474,00:33:29.90,00:33:29.90,Head back that way. I'll see you tomorrow.
475,00:33:31.90,00:33:31.90,"One, two, three, Rotu! >> We lost our first immunity"
476,00:34:12.47,00:34:12.47,"challenge yesterday, and today we have to go to Tribal Council."
477,00:34:16.60,00:34:16.60,So the game has begun. >> The party is over.
478,00:34:18.83,00:34:18.83,We first got here. We started the fire early.
479,00:34:21.17,00:34:21.17,Everybody got to work. But now we lost the challenge
480,00:34:24.13,00:34:24.13,and the reality set in. Somebody has to go.
481,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83,">> My strategy is to keep as strong as, as strong as"
482,00:34:30.13,00:34:30.13,possible. >> The impression the tribe gave
483,00:34:33.07,00:34:33.07,me was that I needed to be voted off to keep the tribe strong.
484,00:34:37.53,00:34:37.53,I'm not weak. I know I'm not 25.
485,00:34:39.87,00:34:39.87,I'm twice that. I know I can't keep up with you
486,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20,"in a foot race, but I can be steady, I can endure, you know."
487,00:34:47.70,00:34:47.70,"I said is it because I'm a woman or I'm overweight, is it because"
488,00:34:51.53,00:34:51.53,they think me a mama figure-- all that was going through my
489,00:34:55.00,00:34:55.00,mind. >> A lot of times the person
490,00:34:56.73,00:34:56.73,that looks strongest right out of the chute.
491,00:34:58.87,00:34:58.87,">> We don't know what's going to happen, is all I'm saying."
492,00:35:01.87,00:35:01.87,>> That's called life. >> I'm glad you told me your
493,00:35:04.23,00:35:04.23,"strategy, but I don't want to talk about it right now."
494,00:35:06.77,00:35:06.77,We're going to go tonight and nobody is to convince me to vote
495,00:35:10.33,00:35:10.33,any way because I'm going to vote the way I want to vote.
496,00:35:13.63,00:35:13.63,That's the way it is. I guess Peter got on our nerves
497,00:35:16.37,00:35:16.37,this morning a little bit because he came up and called us
498,00:35:19.10,00:35:19.10,all over and wanted to talk about what the strategy of the
499,00:35:21.87,00:35:21.87,game was and how he was going to do it.
500,00:35:23.73,00:35:23.73,">> I'm not this magical mystical person, all right?"
501,00:35:27.57,00:35:27.57,>> Mm-hmm. >> I think if you want to get
502,00:35:30.57,00:35:30.57,"the truth of the situation, you just can look in someone's eyes."
503,00:35:34.37,00:35:34.37,"That's not just like, that's not like, ""Ooh!,"" you know."
504,00:35:37.40,00:35:37.40,I would have to say tonight that I'm going to vote for Peter.
505,00:35:39.70,00:35:39.70,"He's just got this strange smirk on his face, always looks like"
506,00:35:42.10,00:35:42.10,he's up to something. He's just strange.
507,00:35:45.60,00:35:45.60,>> I know you don't have an alliance.
508,00:35:47.20,00:35:47.20,"I know I don't have an alliance. >> I mean, an alliance right now"
509,00:35:50.40,00:35:50.40,means absolutely nothing. >> I did think about who I
510,00:35:53.53,00:35:53.53,"possibly may want to vote out, and I was thinking the whole"
511,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,time maybe Sarah. Just today feels too good to be
512,00:36:00.53,00:36:00.53,"in the water and not, like, doing stuff, you know?"
513,00:36:02.77,00:36:02.77,">> When you look at Sarah and you go, other than having two"
514,00:36:05.60,00:36:05.60,"floating devices that can help us out there, what value is she"
515,00:36:08.63,00:36:08.63,"to the group, other than looking cute?"
516,00:36:10.47,00:36:10.47,It's very uncomfortable for all of us because we're all one
517,00:36:14.53,00:36:14.53,"family. It's not chauvinistic, but the"
518,00:36:17.37,00:36:17.37,"more males you have in a camp, the better I think you can"
519,00:36:21.77,00:36:21.77,survive. >> Good luck.
520,00:36:24.00,00:36:24.00,">> Good luck. >> Good luck, Peter."
521,00:36:27.70,00:36:27.70,">> Thanks, bud. >> There's three people that I"
522,00:36:32.30,00:36:32.30,"might choose to vote on: Patricia, if you look at"
523,00:36:34.90,00:36:34.90,"physical strength, she is the weakest person, maybe, just"
524,00:36:38.27,00:36:38.27,"because she's old; Sarah, I think she knows she can"
525,00:36:41.27,00:36:41.27,"maybe use her body with the men, the guys of the tribe;"
526,00:36:44.50,00:36:44.50,and Peter because of what happened this morning.
527,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,But right now I have no clue who I'm going to vote for.
528,00:36:53.33,00:36:53.33,>> Eventually every one us is going but the winner.
529,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,And who knows who that will be? >> PROBST: Behind each of you
530,00:37:19.37,00:37:19.37,guys is a tribal torch. Why don't you go ahead and find
531,00:37:21.57,00:37:21.57,your torch and approach the flame?
532,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,Go ahead and put it back in its slot.
533,00:37:36.33,00:37:36.33,We do this because fire does represent life at Tribal
534,00:37:39.53,00:37:39.53,"Council. As long as you have fire, you"
535,00:37:41.77,00:37:41.77,"have life in this game. When your fire is gone, so are"
536,00:37:45.40,00:37:45.40,you. It's that simple.
537,00:37:46.70,00:37:46.70,"Now, all over the Marquesas there are ancient dwellings like"
538,00:37:50.07,00:37:50.07,"this one, thousands of years things have taken place,"
539,00:37:52.90,00:37:52.90,everything from sacrifices to other rituals.
540,00:37:55.13,00:37:55.13,Tribal Council is certainly a ritual.
541,00:37:57.53,00:37:57.53,"The vote, definitely a sacrifice."
542,00:38:00.60,00:38:00.60,Because this is where you're held accountable for your
543,00:38:03.80,00:38:03.80,actions on the island. Sometimes those actions are
544,00:38:06.30,00:38:06.30,going to help you; sometimes they're going to hurt you.
545,00:38:08.67,00:38:08.67,That's what the vote is all about.
546,00:38:10.03,00:38:10.03,That's what we're going to find out tonight.
547,00:38:11.87,00:38:11.87,"But before we get to the first vote, let's talk about the first"
548,00:38:15.13,00:38:15.13,"few days. Gina, what's it like having to"
549,00:38:17.63,00:38:17.63,"source your own food, your own water and your own fire?"
550,00:38:21.30,00:38:21.30,"Is it rewarding at the end of the day to say, ""We created all"
551,00:38:24.77,00:38:24.77,"of this?"" >> Yeah, it's very rewarding to"
552,00:38:26.90,00:38:26.90,do that. We're not given rice.
553,00:38:28.40,00:38:28.40,We're not given water. We're not given fire.
554,00:38:30.63,00:38:30.63,We won't be given any of those and we have to get it and
555,00:38:33.43,00:38:33.43,we've got it. And that... that's awesome.
556,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,">> PROBST: Pete, did a leader emerge yet, a clear leader, or"
557,00:38:40.77,00:38:40.77,"is it still a tribe? >> Yeah, somebody did step up,"
558,00:38:44.53,00:38:44.53,and I value the fact that Hunter did step up because I wouldn't
559,00:38:49.00,00:38:49.00,have wanted it any other way. He has been optimistic.
560,00:38:52.57,00:38:52.57,"He has been open, asking each and every one of us what we"
561,00:38:56.40,00:38:56.40,"suggest, and I really value and respect that."
562,00:38:59.43,00:38:59.43,">> PROBST: Peter, feel like you fit in with this group?"
563,00:39:02.20,00:39:02.20,">> Actually, I never felt comfortable."
564,00:39:03.97,00:39:03.97,"Once I got on land, just didn't feel quite right to me, and I"
565,00:39:06.83,00:39:06.83,was very surprised. I thought it was going to be a
566,00:39:09.17,00:39:09.17,"piece of cake for me. >> PROBST: Sarah, do you think"
567,00:39:11.47,00:39:11.47,"you have a role yet to find? >> Kind of everything, we're all"
568,00:39:14.07,00:39:14.07,"just sticking together, doing what needs to be done."
569,00:39:16.30,00:39:16.30,"We're all come together like that, but I mean, there are some"
570,00:39:18.73,00:39:18.73,"of us that are definitely better at things than others, but I'm"
571,00:39:21.27,00:39:21.27,just kind of jumping in. >> PROBST: Okay.
572,00:39:23.07,00:39:23.07,"Well, somebody always has the distinction of being the first"
573,00:39:26.13,00:39:26.13,person voted out of the tribe. It's time to find out who that
574,00:39:29.47,00:39:29.47,person is. Here's how it's going to work.
575,00:39:31.73,00:39:31.73,"One by one, you guys are going to make your way along the rock"
576,00:39:35.10,00:39:35.10,path up to the voting confessional.
577,00:39:37.03,00:39:37.03,You'll write down the name of the person you're voting out in
578,00:39:40.10,00:39:40.10,"clear letters, hold it up, state the reason why you're voting for"
579,00:39:43.40,00:39:43.40,"that person. Okay, it's time to vote."
580,00:39:45.70,00:39:45.70,"Peter, you're first. >> Tricia, you deserve to stay."
581,00:40:40.23,00:40:40.23,">> This person is a very nice person, but he did a couple"
582,00:40:42.77,00:40:42.77,things today that really kind of threw me off.
583,00:40:44.83,00:40:44.83,"So my vote is for Peter. >> Sarah, I love you like a play"
584,00:41:18.07,00:41:18.07,cousin. I just don't think you was doing
585,00:41:20.30,00:41:20.30,your... your end of the bargain. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
586,00:41:31.00,00:41:31.00,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
587,00:41:49.20,00:41:49.20,decision is final. The person voted out will be
588,00:41:51.07,00:41:51.07,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
589,00:41:53.10,00:41:53.10,I'll read the votes. First vote...

595,00:42:35.67,00:42:35.67,First person voted out of the tribe: Peter.
596,00:42:39.57,00:42:39.57,No need to read the last vote. We'll leave that a mystery.
597,00:42:41.63,00:42:41.63,"Peter, you need to bring me your torch."
598,00:42:53.50,00:42:53.50,"Peter, the tribe has spoken. >> Go get them."
599,00:43:01.03,00:43:01.03,>> PROBST: Time for you to go. You survived your first vote.
600,00:43:17.03,00:43:17.03,Now go back and build your world.
601,00:43:19.33,00:43:19.33,It's only been three days. Anything can happen.
602,00:43:21.50,00:43:21.50,Head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow.
603,00:43:36.03,00:43:36.03,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

605,00:43:44.80,00:43:44.80,>> Here's the plan: Go gather some coconuts.
606,00:43:46.47,00:43:46.47,>> PROBST: ...Patricia takes charge.
607,00:43:47.87,00:43:47.87,>> This is the tool tree. We're going to leave the
608,00:43:50.17,00:43:50.17,machetes here. >> She's doing too much talking.
609,00:43:52.27,00:43:52.27,">> PROBST: At Rotu, a hungry tribe competes for the kill."
610,00:43:56.03,00:43:56.03,( whistles ) But it's Kathy that finds food.
611,00:43:59.37,00:43:59.37,>> Get out here. I'm serious!
612,00:44:07.33,00:44:07.33,>> Sometimes I take myself a little too seriously.
613,00:44:10.47,00:44:10.47,I wish I had heeded my wife's advice of just come to this
614,00:44:14.17,00:44:14.17,"island and have fun. And truly, the other seven"
615,00:44:17.83,00:44:17.83,"contestants, I love them dearly and I'll have fond memories of"
616,00:44:23.40,00:44:23.40,this adventure.
