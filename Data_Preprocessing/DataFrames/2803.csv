562,00:33:29.93,00:33:29.93,WE HAVE A STRONG GUY WITH US.
563,00:33:32.20,00:33:32.20,AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE WE KNOW HAS A PROPENSITY FOR
564,00:33:35.27,00:33:35.27,FAILURE. >> I DON'T WANT TO TELL HIM
565,00:33:36.97,00:33:36.97,"HE'S SAFE. >> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT."
566,00:33:38.67,00:33:38.67,>> I WANT TO PLAY IT LIKE IT'S HIM.
567,00:33:41.93,00:33:41.93,>> I WANT TO J'TIA TO FEEL SUPERSAFE.
568,00:33:45.90,00:33:45.90,>> I'M STILL PISSED ABOUT THE RICE.
569,00:33:52.33,00:33:52.33,>> IT IS HARD BECAUSE I LIKE SPENCER.
570,00:33:56.03,00:33:56.03,">> IF WE HAVE A MERGE OR SOMETHING, HE'LL FLIP WITH"
571,00:33:58.67,00:33:58.67,THE MEN. >> IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO
572,00:34:03.67,00:34:03.67,"TRUST PEOPLE, AT SOME POINT IN THE GAME YOU HAVE TO"
573,00:34:07.03,00:34:07.03,TRUST SOMEONE. AND I DON'T TRUST SPENCER.
574,00:34:09.80,00:34:09.80,>> PIE BIG THING IS I'M LOYAL.
575,00:34:11.80,00:34:11.80,BUT I THREW RICE IN THE FIRE.
576,00:34:13.50,00:34:13.50,I HAVE BEEN HOLDING ON WITH MY FINGERNAILS LEAK THE CAT
577,00:34:16.30,00:34:16.30,"ON THE POSTER. HANG IN THERE, THAT'S ME."
578,00:34:18.67,00:34:18.67,SO MY BEST BET NOW IS TO HOPE MY ALLIANCE STICKS.
579,00:34:22.20,00:34:22.20,">> IF THERE IS A SWAP TOMORROW, I TRUST YOU GUYS"
580,00:34:25.20,00:34:25.20,MORE THAN -- >> LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE GONE
581,00:34:28.60,00:34:28.60,"TO BAT FOR ME AND WHATEVER, IF WE GET MIXED UP, HOWEVER,"
582,00:34:33.67,00:34:33.67,I GOT YOU TOO. >> I BELIEVE THAT.
583,00:34:35.67,00:34:35.67,I FEEL THAT WAY MORE THAN -- >> INITIALLY MY THOUGHTS
584,00:34:40.77,00:34:40.77,WERE TO VOTE J'TIA OUT BUT I BELIEVE J'TIA IS A LOYAL
585,00:34:45.77,00:34:45.77,"PERSON. >> THANK YOU, LADIES AND YOU"
586,00:34:49.63,00:34:49.63,"NEVER KNOW, JEFF COULD THROW A CURVE BALL IN THIS GAME"
587,00:34:52.10,00:34:52.10,WHERE YOU NEED A LOYAL PERSON.
588,00:34:54.07,00:34:54.07,THAT IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION IS ARE
589,00:35:00.20,00:35:00.20,WE IN THIS GAME TO WIN CHALLENGES OR TO GO AS FAR
590,00:35:03.00,00:35:03.00,AS WE CAN GO WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOYAL.
591,00:35:06.53,00:35:06.53,">> IF THERE IS A MIX UP, I GUARANTEE YOU WE CAN COUNT"
592,00:35:10.10,00:35:10.10,ON J'TIA. >> THE INTERESTING THING
593,00:35:12.27,00:35:12.27,"ABOUT TOSHA, SHE IS LIKE A PENDULUM, OVER HERE ONE"
594,00:35:15.30,00:35:15.30,"MINUTE, OVER HERE T MIGHT CHANGE AGAIN BEFORE TRIBAL"
595,00:35:17.77,00:35:17.77,FIVE TIMES. >> AND I WANT TO LET HER GO
596,00:35:20.07,00:35:20.07,BUT THEN I STOP AND THINK FOR THE LONGEVITY OF THIS
597,00:35:24.80,00:35:24.80,GAME IS IT THE WISEST THING TO DO.
598,00:35:27.43,00:35:27.43,I WANTED TO TALK IT OUT WITH YOU BECAUSE I COULD BE
599,00:35:29.80,00:35:29.80,"TOTALLY OFF, KASS. >> IT'S A RISK, EITHER WAY."
600,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,>> TOSHA CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT TO ME JUST MAKE A
601,00:35:35.53,00:35:35.53,DECISION AND LIVE WITH IT. BUT THAT'S MY LIFE.
602,00:35:37.63,00:35:37.63,I HAVE TO MAKE DECISION FOR PEOPLE AND LIVE WITH THEM
603,00:35:39.70,00:35:39.70,ALL THE TIME. SO AM I THE HATCHET MAN NOR
604,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43,J'TIA OR SPENCER. I CAN LIVE WITH EITHER
605,00:35:45.20,00:35:45.20,DECISION. EITHER ONE IS THE SAME
606,00:35:46.47,00:35:46.47,GAMBLE TO ME BECAUSE I CAN'T PREDICT WHAT IS GOING TO
607,00:35:48.90,00:35:48.90,HAPPEN TOMORROW .
608,00:36:21.80,00:36:21.80,>> Jeff: SO J'TIA WHERE DOW FIT IN THIS GROUP IN TERMS
609,00:36:24.87,00:36:24.87,"OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES. >> HONESTLY, TODAY IN THE"
610,00:36:28.30,00:36:28.30,"WATER, I DID THE ABSOLUTE BEST I COULD."
611,00:36:31.57,00:36:31.57,SO REALLY-- IN HIGH STRESS INFORMATIONS I USUALLY RISE
612,00:36:37.10,00:36:37.10,TO THE TOPMENT I DO THINK I HAVE PHYSICALITY.
613,00:36:40.10,00:36:40.10,THAT IS NOT ME. SWIMMING IS JUST NOT MY
614,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,"THING. >> Jeff: TOSHA, DOES THAT"
615,00:36:44.20,00:36:44.20,"RING TRUE TO YOU THAT J'TIA HAS BEEN WEAK ONCE, WHICH IS"
616,00:36:47.97,00:36:47.97,"TODAY. >> NO, J'TIA HAS BEEN WEAK"
617,00:36:50.07,00:36:50.07,"IN MOST OF THE CHALLENGES, JEFF."
618,00:36:54.07,00:36:54.07,"WHEN WE GO INTO THE CHALLENGES, WE DO HAVE TO"
619,00:36:57.13,00:36:57.13,FIND A ROLE FOR HER THAT IS THE MOST MINIMAL ROLE.
620,00:37:02.60,00:37:02.60,>> Jeff: J'TIA WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE TO HEAR FROM
621,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,SOMEBODY WHO IS SAYING IF WE COULD GET RID OF THE WEAK
622,00:37:07.50,00:37:07.50,LINK IT WOULD BE J'TIA. >> I THINK I HAVE BEEN THE
623,00:37:10.50,00:37:10.50,WEAKEST IN CHALLENGES. I DON'T THINK SHE SAID I WAS
624,00:37:12.60,00:37:12.60,"THE WEAK LINK, THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE."
625,00:37:14.63,00:37:14.63,"IN SURVIVOR IT'S NOT JUST OUTPLAY, IT'S ALSO OUTWIT,"
626,00:37:17.40,00:37:17.40,SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
627,00:37:19.10,00:37:19.10,>> Jeff: ALTHOUGH YOU LEFT ONE ASPECT OUT WHICH IS YOU
628,00:37:21.20,00:37:21.20,HAVE TO LAST LONG ENOUGH TO OUTLAST THE OTHERS AND AT
629,00:37:23.60,00:37:23.60,"THE RATE YOU'RE GOING, NONE OF YOU WILL BE THERE AT THE"
630,00:37:26.63,00:37:26.63,END. >> NO.
631,00:37:28.00,00:37:28.00,">> Jeff: THAT'S REALLY THE DILEMMA, ISN'T IT, TOSHA."
632,00:37:30.40,00:37:30.40,>> THAT IS THE DECISION. DO WE GO WITH OUR STRONG
633,00:37:33.43,00:37:33.43,"CHALLENGE MEMBER, EXPERIENCER WHO KICKED ME"
634,00:37:35.87,00:37:35.87,OUT OF THE ALLIANCE WITH HE AND GARRETT OR DO WE GO WITH
635,00:37:38.90,00:37:38.90,THE PERSON WHO HAS PROVEN HER LOYALTY.
636,00:37:44.33,00:37:44.33,">> Jeff: KASS, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THAT"
637,00:37:46.37,00:37:46.37,J'TIA THREW OUT 95% OF YOUR RICE INTO A FIRE.
638,00:37:49.30,00:37:49.30,>> I LOOK AT THE FIRE AND THE RICE INCIDENT AS AN
639,00:37:52.87,00:37:52.87,"EMOTIONAL RESPONSE, NOT AS A SIGN OF DISLOYALTY."
640,00:37:56.27,00:37:56.27,I JUST THINK SHE'S A HOT HEAD.
641,00:37:57.97,00:37:57.97,BUT I GET HER. I MEAN I WAS A HOT HEAD TOO.
642,00:38:00.10,00:38:00.10,AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT LOYAL IT JUST MEANS I
643,00:38:02.80,00:38:02.80,MAKE SOME BAD DECISIONS. >> Jeff: THE PROBLEM WITH
644,00:38:04.50,00:38:04.50,BAD DECISIONS IS THEY CAN COST YOU A MILLION DOLLARS
645,00:38:06.70,00:38:06.70,"IN THIS GAME. >> RIGHT, TONIGHT I MAY MAKE"
646,00:38:09.00,00:38:09.00,A REALLY BAD DECISION. THAT WEIGHS ON ME HEAVILY
647,00:38:12.53,00:38:12.53,"RIGHT NOW. >> Jeff: SO SPENCER, HOW"
648,00:38:15.10,00:38:15.10,"DOES THIS SIT WITH YOU? >> WELL, I MEAN I THINK THE"
649,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,RICE DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR HER.
650,00:38:19.53,00:38:19.53,"YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU DO HAVE SIGNS OF LOYALTY BUT"
651,00:38:22.93,00:38:22.93,UNPREDICTABILITY IS JUST AS DANGEROUS AS DISLOYALTY AT
652,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,TIMES. I'M TO THE GOING TO MAKE A
653,00:38:27.83,00:38:27.83,DUMB MISTAKE LIKE THAT AND I WILL BE WITH THIS GROUP
654,00:38:30.73,00:38:30.73,GOING FORWARD. >> YOU SAID THAT ONCE BEFORE
655,00:38:32.87,00:38:32.87,"SO I MEAN -- >> RIGHT, AND I THIRX I MEAN"
656,00:38:35.57,00:38:35.57,I CAN'T GET AROUND THAT I WAS THE BONE HEAD WHO WAS ON
657,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,THE WRONG SIDE OF THE VOTE LAST TIME.
658,00:38:40.23,00:38:40.23,>> Jeff: J'TIA ARE YOU AND SPENCER AWAY THAT WHILE
659,00:38:42.70,00:38:42.70,YOU'RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER THAT KASS AND TOSHA ARE
660,00:38:45.77,00:38:45.77,TALKING TO EACH OTHER. >> I HEAR THEM WHISPERING IN
661,00:38:47.80,00:38:47.80,FRONT OF ME. I KNOW WHAT WE SPOKE ABOUT
662,00:38:49.93,00:38:49.93,BEFORE WE CAME HERE. I HOPE THAT THE ALLIANCE CAN
663,00:38:53.23,00:38:53.23,"STAND. >> Jeff: SPENCER, THEY JUS"
664,00:38:56.37,00:38:56.37,"JUST-- NODDING. >> IT'S CRAZY AS A VIEWER, I"
665,00:38:59.40,00:38:59.40,"THINK I WOULD LOVE IT RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW."
666,00:39:02.30,00:39:02.30,"IT'S PRETTY SCARER. >> Jeff: KASS, YOU SEEM TO"
667,00:39:05.03,00:39:05.03,BE ENJOYING THIS. >> I LOVE SURVIVOR.
668,00:39:07.00,00:39:07.00,"SO LIKE IF YOU ARE'S SITTING WATCHING THIS, I'M THE ONE"

670,00:39:12.83,00:39:12.83,"SOMETHING STUPID, KASS. BUT WHAT IS STUPID?"
671,00:39:15.50,00:39:15.50,>> Jeff: THAT'S THE QUESTION.
672,00:39:16.23,00:39:16.23,>> THAT IS THE QUESTION RIGHT NOW.
673,00:39:18.63,00:39:18.63,">> Jeff: SO LOOK AT YOU, SPENCER WHAT DOES THAT FEEL"
674,00:39:21.17,00:39:21.17,LIKE AS A SUPERFAN OF THE SHOW AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET
675,00:39:23.47,00:39:23.47,A CHANCE TO REALLY PLAY. >> I MEAN IT'S DEVASTATING.
676,00:39:27.80,00:39:27.80,"AND RIGHT NOW I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO AVOID THAT, YOU"
677,00:39:31.97,00:39:31.97,KNOW. >> Jeff: TOSH IS NOT EVEN
