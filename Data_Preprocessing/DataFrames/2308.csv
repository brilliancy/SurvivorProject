10,00:00:14.57,00:00:14.57,WITH THE MERGE LOONLING OZZY
11,00:00:17.00,00:00:17.00,PROPOSES A RISKY PLAN.
12,00:00:17.57,00:00:17.57,I WOULD BE WILLING TO

18,00:00:24.50,00:00:24.50,THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
19,00:00:25.60,00:00:25.60,I HAD A DREAM AND I SAW MY
20,00:00:28.37,00:00:28.37,CHANCE AT MY OWN REDEMPTION.
21,00:00:29.40,00:00:29.40,OZZY ALSO WANTED COCHRAN TO
22,00:00:32.30,00:00:32.30,BE A DOUBLE AGENT.
23,00:00:33.27,00:00:33.27,"I WILL MAKE UP A STORY,"
24,00:00:35.40,00:00:35.40,"COCHRAN IS THE SMART WEASEL, HE"
25,00:00:38.80,00:00:38.80,VOTE HIM OUT AND WHIPS OUT THE

27,00:00:42.87,00:00:42.87,AND GAVE OZZY HIS IMMUNITY
28,00:00:46.90,00:00:46.90,IDOL.
29,00:00:47.60,00:00:47.60,"IN THE END, SAVAII WENT ALONG"
30,00:00:49.67,00:00:49.67,WITH THE PLAN.
31,00:00:50.33,00:00:50.33,"OZZY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
32,00:00:51.97,00:00:51.97,"NOW THE QUESTIONS ARE, CAN"
33,00:00:53.93,00:00:53.93,OZZY WIN AT REDEMPTION ISLAND?
34,00:00:55.70,00:00:55.70,I AM OUT OF HERE?
35,00:00:57.40,00:00:57.40,WILL THERE BE A MERGE AND
36,00:00:59.67,00:00:59.67,CAN COCHRAN BE A MASTER SPY?
37,00:01:13.27,00:01:13.27,THE WEIRDEST MERGE IN SURVIVOR HISTORY.
38,00:01:13.90,00:01:13.90,WHAT WHAT A DIFFERENCE THE
39,00:01:16.27,00:01:16.27,DAY MAKES.
40,00:01:16.97,00:01:16.97,A DAY AGO I THOUGHT I WAS
41,00:01:19.27,00:01:19.27,"GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND,"
42,00:01:20.53,00:01:20.53,WHERE I WOULD HUMILIATE MYSELF
43,00:01:22.63,00:01:22.63,AND GO HOME.
44,00:01:23.27,00:01:23.27,OZZY CAME FROM THE HEAVENS
45,00:01:25.43,00:01:25.43,AND GAVE THIS MIRACULOUS PLAN
46,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33,WHERE HE WOULD SACRIFICE HIMSELF
47,00:01:29.77,00:01:29.77,"ON THE BASIS OF THE TRIBE, BASED"
48,00:01:31.63,00:01:31.63,ON THE MERGE THAT WILL TAKE
49,00:01:32.90,00:01:32.90,PLACE AND THE GAMBLE YOUR YOU
50,00:01:36.13,00:01:36.13,PROVE YOURSELF IN AN EXTREMELY
51,00:01:37.40,00:01:37.40,STRONG PLAYER AT REDEMPTION
52,00:01:38.77,00:01:38.77,ISLAND.
53,00:01:39.47,00:01:39.47,IF EVERYTHING CONNECTS IN THE
54,00:01:40.27,00:01:40.27,WAY WE HOPE IT WILL THIS IS
55,00:01:41.47,00:01:41.47,GOING TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS
56,00:01:42.73,00:01:42.73,ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST AND
57,00:01:44.10,00:01:44.10,GREATEST MOVES IN SURVIVOR
58,00:01:45.63,00:01:45.63,HISTORY.
59,00:01:51.27,00:01:51.27,WHAT IS OUR BEST OPTION TO
60,00:01:52.67,00:01:52.67,STAY IN THE GAME?
61,00:01:56.93,00:01:56.93,I WAS WILLING TO GO.
62,00:01:59.80,00:01:59.80,YOU CAN EASILY SAY YOU ARE
63,00:02:01.57,00:02:01.57,"WILLING TO GO, BUT TO ACTUALLY"
64,00:02:02.77,00:02:02.77,"DO IT, STEP UP AND TAKE CONTROL,"
65,00:02:05.70,00:02:05.70,THAT IS DIFFERENT.
66,00:02:08.27,00:02:08.27,"THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE, I"
67,00:02:11.43,00:02:11.43,DON'T LIVE IT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
68,00:02:12.70,00:02:12.70,JUST STEP UP AND PROVE TO THE
69,00:02:14.47,00:02:14.47,WORLD WHAT YOU CAN DO.
70,00:02:15.80,00:02:15.80,WHAT CAN I DO IN TERMS OF OUR
71,00:02:18.60,00:02:18.60,PLAN IS.
72,00:02:19.17,00:02:19.17,I PRESUME IF I GO TO THE
73,00:02:21.43,00:02:21.43,OTHER SIDE THEY WILL ASK WHAT
74,00:02:23.47,00:02:23.47,BOND EXISTS BETWEEN ALL OF YOU.
75,00:02:24.80,00:02:24.80,"YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT, MAN."
76,00:02:26.77,00:02:26.77,YOU JUST HAVE TO --
77,00:02:27.70,00:02:27.70,I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
78,00:02:29.97,00:02:29.97,YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SAY.
79,00:02:31.00,00:02:31.00,ANOTHER BIG PART OF THE PLAN
80,00:02:32.53,00:02:32.53,IS THAT I BECOME THE SORT OF
81,00:02:34.73,00:02:34.73,DOUBLE AGENT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO
82,00:02:36.27,00:02:36.27,FIGURE OUT WHO THE UPOLU
83,00:02:41.27,00:02:41.27,TRIBE PLANS TO VOTE OUT
84,00:02:42.50,00:02:42.50,IN THE EVENT OF A MERGE.
85,00:02:43.80,00:02:43.80,EVERYBODY IN THIS GAME IS
86,00:02:45.43,00:02:45.43,"CAPABLE OF BEING A DOUBLE AGENT,"
87,00:02:47.53,00:02:47.53,"IF ANYBODY, IT IS ME."
88,00:02:48.40,00:02:48.40,I HAVE ALREADY BEEN
89,00:02:51.40,00:02:51.40,PRETENDING LIKE I LIKE THE
90,00:02:52.30,00:02:52.30,"PEOPLE IN MY TRIBE AN 18-DAY, I"
91,00:02:54.50,00:02:54.50,THINK I DESERVE AN ACADEMY AWARD
92,00:02:56.33,00:02:56.33,FOR THAT PERFORMANCE.
93,00:02:57.90,00:02:57.90,I WILL PLAY WHATEVER PART I
94,00:02:59.73,00:02:59.73,NEED TO PLAY.
95,00:03:02.10,00:03:02.10,I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT THAT
96,00:03:04.47,00:03:04.47,WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
97,00:03:05.17,00:03:05.17,NO.
98,00:03:06.97,00:03:06.97,THAT IS SWEET.
99,00:03:09.27,00:03:09.27,THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
100,00:03:10.07,00:03:10.07,"RIGHT NOW, MY PHILOSOPHY, TO"
101,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,TAKE FROM AL PACINO.

103,00:03:18.90,00:03:18.90,PLAYER VOTED OUT AND THEN YOU
104,00:03:20.17,00:03:20.17,GET HIS IDOL AND THEN YOU GET
105,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,THE MILLION DOLLARS.

116,00:04:01.87,00:04:01.87,"OH, MAN."

130,00:04:23.67,00:04:23.67,PUT ON MY ACTOR SUIT.
131,00:04:24.90,00:04:24.90,AND ALL VOTED COCHRAN AND HE
132,00:04:27.20,00:04:27.20,PULLED OUT THE IDOL.
133,00:04:27.87,00:04:27.87,AND HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY?
134,00:04:29.23,00:04:29.23,NO.
135,00:04:29.80,00:04:29.80,I THINK SHE BOUGHT IT.
136,00:04:30.93,00:04:30.93,I THINK THAT SHE TOOK IT
137,00:04:33.30,00:04:33.30,"HOOK, LINE AND SINKER."
138,00:04:36.20,00:04:36.20,"I GET TAKEN OUT, I DIDN'T"

141,00:04:44.67,00:04:44.67,LAWYERS? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
142,00:04:47.47,00:04:47.47,THIS IS PART OF THE PLAN.
143,00:04:49.87,00:04:49.87,FIRST STEP IS GETTING MYSELF
144,00:04:51.23,00:04:51.23,VOTED OUT.

149,00:04:59.67,00:04:59.67,THE MOVE IS PROBABLY EITHER
150,00:05:01.67,00:05:01.67,THE STUPIDEST THING I COULD HAVE
151,00:05:03.33,00:05:03.33,"DONE OR THE CRAZIEST, BALLSIEST"
152,00:05:05.73,00:05:05.73,THING I PROBABLY COULD EVER HAVE

164,00:05:52.17,00:05:52.17,"OZZY, ARE YOU SURPRISED TO FIND"
165,00:05:54.13,00:05:54.13,YOURSELF ON REDEMPTION ISLAND?

167,00:05:58.87,00:05:58.87,"EVERYTHING TO MY TRIBE, AND THEN"
168,00:06:00.67,00:06:00.67,WE LOSE ONE CHALLENGE BECAUSE

170,00:06:04.07,00:06:04.07,AND THAT ENDS UP BEING THE
171,00:06:06.40,00:06:06.40,PERSON THAT SENDS ME HERE.
172,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,"PLAYS THE IDOL, YOU DON'T EVEN"

181,00:06:24.97,00:06:24.97,FURTHEST IN THE GAME.
182,00:06:26.50,00:06:26.50,BUT I THRIVE UNDER THE PRESSURE
183,00:06:28.03,00:06:28.03,TO COME BACK IN THE GAME FOR
184,00:06:30.23,00:06:30.23,"REVENGE, BASICALLY."

191,00:06:41.27,00:06:41.27,POLE.
192,00:06:41.83,00:06:41.83,YOU WILL USE THE POLE TO
193,00:06:43.97,00:06:43.97,RETRIEVE THREE KEYS.
194,00:06:45.40,00:06:45.40,THE THREE KEYS OPEN THREE LOCKS.
195,00:06:48.13,00:06:48.13,THE FIRST PERSON TO SET THROUGH
196,00:06:51.03,00:06:51.03,THEIR DOOR WINS THIS DUAL.
197,00:06:52.80,00:06:52.80,THE LOSER IS OUT OF THE GAUGE
198,00:06:55.43,00:06:55.43,FOR GOOD.
199,00:06:56.27,00:06:56.27,THERE IS ONE SIGNIFICANT
200,00:06:58.07,00:06:58.07,DIFFERENCE WITH TODAY'S DUAL.
201,00:06:59.70,00:06:59.70,THE WINNER OF THIS DUAL DOES NOT
202,00:07:01.47,00:07:01.47,GO BACK TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

214,00:07:33.77,00:07:33.77,YOUR FIRST GOAL IS TO BUILD
215,00:07:36.07,00:07:36.07,THAT POLE.
216,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,IT NEEDS TO BE LONG ENOUGH AND
217,00:07:39.33,00:07:39.33,STRONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE KEYS.

691,00:26:32.40,00:26:32.40,WE BETTER START REEVALUATING
692,00:26:34.37,00:26:34.37,WHERE THEY ALL LIE.
693,00:26:37.00,00:26:37.00,SOPHIE WOULD BE MY PICK.
694,00:26:39.03,00:26:39.03,IF ANYTHING IF WE ARE GOING

696,00:26:42.67,00:26:42.67,RICK.
697,00:26:43.23,00:26:43.23,I THINK WE RUN THE LEAST
698,00:26:44.37,00:26:44.37,AMOUNT OF RISK IN TERMS OF AN
699,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,IDOL PLAY IF WE GO WITH RICK.

706,00:27:03.40,00:27:03.40,EVERYBODY IS OKAY WITH
707,00:27:05.77,00:27:05.77,THROWING ROCKS.
708,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40,"KEITH, ARE YOU THROWING A ROCK?"
709,00:27:10.73,00:27:10.73,YEAH.
710,00:27:11.27,00:27:11.27,"AS OF RIGHT NOW, MY"
711,00:27:12.70,00:27:12.70,IMPRESSION IS THAT BOTH TRIBES
712,00:27:14.50,00:27:14.50,BELIEVE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A
713,00:27:16.43,00:27:16.43,DEADLOCK AT THE VOTE.
714,00:27:17.87,00:27:17.87,NOBODY LIKES THE IDEA OF PICKING
715,00:27:21.70,00:27:21.70,ROCKS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
716,00:27:25.40,00:27:25.40,BUT GO SAVAII MEMBERS HAVE
717,00:27:26.80,00:27:26.80,"IMMUNITY, IT IS GREAT FOR US"
718,00:27:27.90,00:27:27.90,BECAUSE IF IT COMES DOWN TO A
719,00:27:29.57,00:27:29.57,PICK EM THERE ARE TEN PICKS AND
720,00:27:32.27,00:27:32.27,ONLY FOUR OF US ON THE CHOPPING
721,00:27:33.90,00:27:33.90,BLOCK AND SIX OF THEM.
722,00:27:34.57,00:27:34.57,SO YOU AND I ARE OUT OF THE
723,00:27:36.00,00:27:36.00,VOTE.
724,00:27:36.63,00:27:36.63,WE ARE OUT OF THE VOTE AND
725,00:27:37.90,00:27:37.90,WHOEVER PLAYS THE IDOL IS OUT OF
726,00:27:39.40,00:27:39.40,THE VOTE.
727,00:27:40.60,00:27:40.60,THEY WOULD NEVER THINK THAT
728,00:27:42.37,00:27:42.37,WHITNEY WOULD HAVE IT.
729,00:27:43.00,00:27:43.00,NOT EVER.
730,00:27:44.17,00:27:44.17,WHICH MEANS I PRETTY MUCH
731,00:27:47.47,00:27:47.47,BASICALLY HAVE TO PLAY THE IDOL.
732,00:27:48.37,00:27:48.37,I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
733,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,VOTE FOR WHITNEY.
734,00:27:51.37,00:27:51.37,WHY? BECAUSE IF IT GOES TO
735,00:27:53.07,00:27:53.07,"ROCKS, WHITNEY IS IMMUNE FROM"
736,00:27:54.40,00:27:54.40,THE ROCKS AND THEY WANT TO HAVE
737,00:27:55.67,00:27:55.67,SOME OF THE STRONGER PLAYERS IN
738,00:27:57.37,00:27:57.37,"THERE, ME AND KEITH, AND IN"
739,00:27:58.90,00:27:58.90,"THEIR MINDS, THEY CAN GET RID OF"
740,00:28:01.37,00:28:01.37,WHITNEY LATER.
741,00:28:02.03,00:28:02.03,"DO WE WANT TO HAVE COCHRAN,"
742,00:28:04.37,00:28:04.37,"THEN, STILL BE A LITTLE WAFFLY"
743,00:28:07.23,00:28:07.23,TODAY?
744,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,IF THEY TELL ME MIGHT BE TO
745,00:28:10.70,00:28:10.70,VOTE FOR THEN WE KNOW THAT'S NOT
746,00:28:12.67,00:28:12.67,WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR.
747,00:28:13.57,00:28:13.57,SAVAII MAY FEEL CONFIDENT
748,00:28:16.03,00:28:16.03,THAT WE HAVE A THREE OUT OF
749,00:28:17.20,00:28:17.20,EIGHT SHOT OR WHATEVER THE
750,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17,"NUMBERS ARE, BUT THOSE NUMBERS"
751,00:28:19.87,00:28:19.87,"AREN'T THAT REASSURING TO ME,"
752,00:28:21.87,00:28:21.87,EVEN IF IT IS ONE OUT OF 30 THAT
753,00:28:23.57,00:28:23.57,A ROCK WOULD SEND ME HOME I
754,00:28:25.03,00:28:25.03,WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT.
755,00:28:25.87,00:28:25.87,THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS GAME IS
756,00:28:27.13,00:28:27.13,ABOUT.
757,00:28:27.80,00:28:27.80,I LOVE THIS GAME AND RESPECT

759,00:28:30.27,00:28:30.27,REDUCING MY GAME TO A GAME OF
760,00:28:31.70,00:28:31.70,CHANCE AND PULLING A ROCK OUT OF
761,00:28:33.23,00:28:33.23,A BAG.
762,00:28:37.37,00:28:37.37,"WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS,"
763,00:28:38.53,00:28:38.53,THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR RICK.
764,00:28:41.40,00:28:41.40,ORIGINALLY IT WAS GOING TO BE
765,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,YOU.
766,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
767,00:28:45.13,00:28:45.13,ME.
768,00:28:45.70,00:28:45.70,"THE LAST SECOND, OZZY IS"
769,00:28:47.23,00:28:47.23,"GOING TO STAND UP, GIVE -- I"
770,00:28:53.60,00:28:53.60,"MEAN, HAVE LIKE RICK PLAY IDOL"
771,00:28:55.70,00:28:55.70,AND --
772,00:28:56.00,00:28:56.00,RIGHT.
773,00:28:58.80,00:28:58.80,"I UNDERSTAND, BUT I THINK THAT"
774,00:29:01.47,00:29:01.47,THIS IS SURVIVOR.
775,00:29:02.23,00:29:02.23,I TRUST YOU.
776,00:29:04.97,00:29:04.97,BUT HAVE GOT TO REALIZE WHERE WE
777,00:29:06.43,00:29:06.43,ARE KOCHING FROM.
778,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,"I DO, I DO."
779,00:29:11.37,00:29:11.37,I HOPE -- DON'T DO ME ANY
780,00:29:21.10,00:29:21.10,FAVORS.
781,00:29:21.80,00:29:21.80,DON'T LET ME GET EATEN ALIVE.
782,00:29:23.37,00:29:23.37,I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE --
783,00:29:26.17,00:29:26.17,"YEAH, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE"
784,00:29:27.87,00:29:27.87,FUN.
785,00:29:28.43,00:29:28.43,YOU CAN NEVER COUNT ON
786,00:29:29.57,00:29:29.57,SOMEONE COMING OVER AND NEVER
787,00:29:30.57,00:29:30.57,KNOW FOR SURE.
788,00:29:31.60,00:29:31.60,"THAT SAID, I THINK I FEEL AS"
789,00:29:34.63,00:29:34.63,CONFIDENT ABOUT COCHRAN FLING
790,00:29:36.10,00:29:36.10,"OVER, BECAUSE COCHRAN THINKS IF"
791,00:29:37.37,00:29:37.37,HE PUSHES AND COMES BACK TO CAMP
792,00:29:39.20,00:29:39.20,"HE IS GOING TO GET BEAT UP,"
793,00:29:40.50,00:29:40.50,WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE THING FOR
794,00:29:42.70,00:29:42.70,A TARGET TO BE AFRAID OF.
795,00:29:50.70,00:29:50.70,THEY ARE GOING TO KILL ME
796,00:29:52.37,00:29:52.37,TONIGHT.
797,00:29:53.10,00:29:53.10,THEY ARE GOING TO EAT ME ALIVE.
798,00:29:54.73,00:29:54.73,THAT IS WHAT I AM DREADING.
799,00:29:56.37,00:29:56.37,I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO EAT
800,00:29:58.20,00:29:58.20,THEM ALIVE.
801,00:29:58.87,00:29:58.87,WHERE AM I SLEEPING TONIGHT?
802,00:30:00.83,00:30:00.83,RIGHT BETWEEN ME AND EDNA.

804,00:30:07.10,00:30:07.10,CARTE BLANCHE.
805,00:30:07.67,00:30:07.67,WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY
806,00:30:09.37,00:30:09.37,TWISTS BUT TO FLUS COCHRAN
807,00:30:10.60,00:30:10.60,BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE NOT IN OUR

821,00:30:40.53,00:30:40.53,WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
822,00:30:45.50,00:30:45.50,"OH, I AM -- I WON'T SAY A"
823,00:30:48.43,00:30:48.43,THING.
824,00:30:49.13,00:30:49.13,I AM JUST GOING TO LET YOU PLAY.
825,00:30:52.67,00:30:52.67,THAT IS MY PRELIMINARY PLAN.
826,00:30:54.53,00:30:54.53,I MEAN THERE ARE A FEW OUTS.
827,00:30:57.73,00:30:57.73,"BEFORE THE CHALLENGE, I JUST"
828,00:31:00.00,00:31:00.00,"THOUGHT, TO ME, THIS IS LIKE"

830,00:31:03.00,00:31:03.00,HOW YOU REMEDY SOMETHING.
831,00:31:05.90,00:31:05.90,I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES.
832,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,"THEY ARE PROMISES, THOUGH."
833,00:31:08.40,00:31:08.40,WHY WOULD THEY WATCH OUT FOR
834,00:31:10.40,00:31:10.40,YOU OVER THEIR OWN PEOPLE.
835,00:31:11.37,00:31:11.37,IF THEY HAVE TWO OF THEIR
836,00:31:13.43,00:31:13.43,PEOPLE WINNING IMMUNITY TODAY
837,00:31:14.77,00:31:14.77,THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO YOU.
838,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,DAWN APPARENTLY IS NOW
839,00:31:19.37,00:31:19.37,UNWILLING TO FLIP HER VOTE
840,00:31:21.37,00:31:21.37,"ALONGSIDE ME AND UPOLU, IT GIVES"
841,00:31:22.57,00:31:22.57,ME SOME PAUSE IN DEBATING
842,00:31:23.93,00:31:23.93,WHETHER OR NOT I WANT TO MAKE
843,00:31:24.90,00:31:24.90,"THE JUMP, BUT IT IS A TOUGH"
844,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,"CHOICE, SHOULD GUY WITH A BUNCH"

849,00:31:38.37,00:31:38.37,BECAUSE I WILL CAUSE SO MANY
850,00:31:39.60,00:31:39.60,PEOPLE TO BE FURIOUS AT ME.
851,00:31:40.80,00:31:40.80,I TOTALLY WILL PLAY YOUR GAME
852,00:31:43.37,00:31:43.37,I AM TELLING YOU WHAT GOES

856,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO
857,00:31:50.90,00:31:50.90,AFFECT EVERYTHING.
858,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,THERE IS NO WAY THAT --
859,00:31:54.13,00:31:54.13,"THE RUDENESS, THE LACK OF"
860,00:31:55.90,00:31:55.90,"COURTESY, THE LACK OF RESPECT --"
861,00:31:58.37,00:31:58.37,I WANT TO BE IN CONTROL FOR
862,00:31:59.70,00:31:59.70,THE FIRST TIME IN MY GAME.
863,00:32:01.27,00:32:01.27,I FEEL LIKE I AM BY SAYING
864,00:32:03.03,00:32:03.03,YOU KNOW WHAT? I WON'T TAKE
865,00:32:04.23,00:32:04.23,YOUR CRAP.
866,00:32:06.43,00:32:06.43,"LOOK, IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT AT"
867,00:32:08.40,00:32:08.40,THIS POINT.
868,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,IT IS ABOUT THAT.
869,00:32:10.60,00:32:10.60,"TO ME, YOU ARE APPEALING TO YOUR"
870,00:32:13.03,00:32:13.03,EMOTION.
871,00:32:13.60,00:32:13.60,I AM AN EMOTIONAL GUY.
872,00:32:15.73,00:32:15.73,"OH, BEFORE I WENT TO THE"
873,00:32:19.00,00:32:19.00,"CHALLENGE, I REALLY SPENT SOME"
874,00:32:20.10,00:32:20.10,"TIME LIKE LITERALLY PRAYING, I"
875,00:32:21.87,00:32:21.87,KNOW IT SOUNDS CLICHE BUT I KIND
876,00:32:23.87,00:32:23.87,OF BACKED OFF MY ORIGINAL
877,00:32:25.40,00:32:25.40,FEELING OF MAYBE I SHOULD FLIP
878,00:32:26.77,00:32:26.77,"WITH COCHRAN, BECAUSE I REALIZED"
879,00:32:29.67,00:32:29.67,"I HAVE LIKED MY TRIBE, IT HASN'T"
880,00:32:31.67,00:32:31.67,BEEN AS KUMBAYA AS I THINK THE
881,00:32:33.50,00:32:33.50,OTHER TRIBE BUT THERE ARE THINGS
882,00:32:34.80,00:32:34.80,ABOUT EACH OF THOSE PEOPLE I
883,00:32:35.93,00:32:35.93,LOVE AND I HAVE HAD GREAT
884,00:32:37.10,00:32:37.10,EXPERIENCES WITH THEM AND I
885,00:32:38.07,00:32:38.07,"DON'T WANT TO GO BACK ON THAT, I"
886,00:32:39.60,00:32:39.60,WANT TO STAY LOYAL TO THE TRIBE.
887,00:32:41.60,00:32:41.60,"HOW ARE YOU DOING, BRO?"
888,00:32:44.10,00:32:44.10,WE ARE ALMOST THERE.
889,00:32:46.87,00:32:46.87,GET BACK IN THE FOLD.
890,00:32:47.90,00:32:47.90,I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE REST
891,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,OF THE TRIBE BECAUSE I CAN
892,00:32:51.00,00:32:51.00,UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS BEHALFING
893,00:32:52.03,00:32:52.03,BUT I AM PRAYING HE DOESN'T AND
894,00:32:53.57,00:32:53.57,I HAVE LET HIM KNOW I AM
895,00:32:55.37,00:32:55.37,"DISAPPOINTED, I DON'T THINK IT"
896,00:32:56.03,00:32:56.03,"IS RIGHT TO PHLEGM, I DON'T."
897,00:32:57.23,00:32:57.23,AND I FEEL LIKE HE IS WATCHING
898,00:32:58.57,00:32:58.57,OUT FOR HIMSELF TONIGHT AND NO
899,00:33:00.03,00:33:00.03,"ONE ELSE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO"
900,00:33:01.37,00:33:01.37,"TELL EVERYBODY, BECAUSE I THINK"
901,00:33:03.23,00:33:03.23,THERE IS HOPE THAT HE IS GOING
902,00:33:04.43,00:33:04.43,"TO NOT DO DO IT, I HAVE LET HIM"
903,00:33:05.57,00:33:05.57,"KNOW, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT."
904,00:33:24.67,00:33:24.67,"SO, COACH, SIX FORMER SAVAII,"
905,00:33:27.90,00:33:27.90,"SIX FORMER UPOLU, IF YOU WERE"
906,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,GOING TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION IT
907,00:33:30.13,00:33:30.13,SEEMS THAT WE MIGHT BE LOOKING
908,00:33:31.53,00:33:31.53,AT A TIE VOTE TONIGHT.
909,00:33:33.93,00:33:33.93,THAT IS CORRECT WE WILL BE
910,00:33:35.47,00:33:35.47,PUTTING ALL OF THE CARDS ON
911,00:33:36.50,00:33:36.50,TABLE TONIGHT.
912,00:33:37.60,00:33:37.60,AND YOU WILL SEE MOST LIKELY SIX
913,00:33:41.73,00:33:41.73,AND SIX.
914,00:33:42.30,00:33:42.30,"Jeff: OZZY, RING TRUE TO"
915,00:33:43.37,00:33:43.37,YOU?
916,00:33:43.67,00:33:43.67,YEAH.
917,00:33:45.13,00:33:45.13,DEFINITELY.
918,00:33:45.80,00:33:45.80,WE WENT INTO THIS CHALLENGE
919,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,TODAY KNOWING WE REALLY NEEDED
920,00:33:48.40,00:33:48.40,TO GET BOTH OF THE IMMUNITY
921,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,NECKLACES BECAUSE CHANCES WERE
922,00:33:52.60,00:33:52.60,WE ARE GOING TO TIE UP AND IT
923,00:33:54.70,00:33:54.70,WAS GOING TO GO TO ROCKS AND IF
924,00:33:56.20,00:33:56.20,"IT DOES, WE BETTER HAVE THE ODDS"
925,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,"ON OUR SIDE, AND WE ARE ALL"
926,00:34:01.13,00:34:01.13,"GOING TO BE SAFE, I GUESS."
927,00:34:04.57,00:34:04.57,Jeff: AND THE REASON THE
928,00:34:05.50,00:34:05.50,"STAKES ARE SO HIGH, DAWN,"
929,00:34:08.73,00:34:08.73,BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO A TIE AND
930,00:34:10.27,00:34:10.27,WE VOTE AGAIN AND YOU ARE STILL
931,00:34:12.10,00:34:12.10,TIED THE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE
932,00:34:13.47,00:34:13.47,VOTES ARE IMMUNE AND EVERYBODY
933,00:34:14.87,00:34:14.87,ELSE IS DRAWING ROCKS WHICH IS A
934,00:34:16.77,00:34:16.77,BIG RISK.
935,00:34:17.47,00:34:17.47,BIG SEX.
936,00:34:18.07,00:34:18.07,IT IS WORTH A BIG RISK.
937,00:34:20.00,00:34:20.00,SO THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK UP A
938,00:34:22.20,00:34:22.20,TIE IS SOMEBODY HAS TO DEFECT TO
939,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,THE OTHER TRIBE.
940,00:34:26.20,00:34:26.20,"EDNA, CAN YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO"
941,00:34:28.33,00:34:28.33,THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR
942,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,SOMEBODY TO SWITCH?
943,00:34:31.70,00:34:31.70,IF THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL DIDN'T
944,00:34:35.10,00:34:35.10,FEEL INCORPORATED OR A PART OF
945,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20,"THAT TRIBE, THAT WOULD BE ONE"
946,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,REASON.
947,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,Jeff: COCHRAN YOU HAVE SAID
948,00:34:41.57,00:34:41.57,IT MANY TIMES YOU ARE A STUDENT
949,00:34:42.63,00:34:42.63,OF THE GAME.
950,00:34:43.43,00:34:43.43,WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YOU WOULD
951,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,HAVE TWO TRIBES THIS UNIFIED?
952,00:34:46.87,00:34:46.87,I HAVE NEVER SEEN TWO TRIBES
953,00:34:48.93,00:34:48.93,THAT SEEM SO ENTIRELY COHESIVE
954,00:34:51.37,00:34:51.37,"IN THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS, IN"
955,00:34:53.00,00:34:53.00,"TERMS OF ODDS, I DON'T KNOW"
956,00:34:54.37,00:34:54.37,"ODDS, I DON'T DO ODDS, I DO"
957,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,SURVIVOR.
958,00:34:58.27,00:34:58.27,"Jeff: JIM, WHAT ARE THE"
959,00:34:59.43,00:34:59.43,CHANCES SOMEBODY FROM YOUR TRIBE
960,00:35:00.87,00:35:00.87,WALKS OVER AND JOINS THEIR
961,00:35:02.30,00:35:02.30,TRIBE?
962,00:35:02.93,00:35:02.93,"ZERO, IT MAKES NO SENSE WE"
963,00:35:04.63,00:35:04.63,"HAVE THE NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE, IT"
964,00:35:06.50,00:35:06.50,DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR ONE
965,00:35:08.10,00:35:08.10,OF US TO DO THAT.
966,00:35:09.10,00:35:09.10,Jeff: ALBERT IS THERE MUCH
967,00:35:10.63,00:35:10.63,"TALK ABOUT THE IDOL, WHETHER"
968,00:35:11.87,00:35:11.87,EACH TRIBE MAY HAVE FOUND AN
969,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,IDOL.
970,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,WE WERE ALL PRESENT AT THE
971,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,DUAL AND OZZY DID HIS BEST
972,00:35:18.00,00:35:18.00,BROADWAY PRODUCTION TO SEE HOW
973,00:35:19.70,00:35:19.70,HE FELT BACK STAB AND HURT ABOUT
974,00:35:21.33,00:35:21.33,THE IDOL AND TIME TO FIND OUT IF
975,00:35:22.93,00:35:22.93,"THAT WAS ALL A SHOW, BECAUSE IF"
976,00:35:24.87,00:35:24.87,THEY HAVE AN IDOL THAT THEY
977,00:35:26.87,00:35:26.87,"PLAY, THAT MEANS THERE WASN'T"
978,00:35:27.87,00:35:27.87,REALLY AN IDOL PLAYED AT THEIR
979,00:35:30.03,00:35:30.03,ORIGINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
980,00:35:31.23,00:35:31.23,"Jeff: SOPHIE, IS IT A"
981,00:35:33.10,00:35:33.10,CONSENSUS OZZY WASN'T TELLING
982,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,THE TRUTH OR IS IT A QUESTION
983,00:35:36.23,00:35:36.23,AND YOU ARE HOPING TO FIND OUT
984,00:35:37.70,00:35:37.70,TONIGHT?
985,00:35:38.33,00:35:38.33,I WAS ACTUALLY OFFENDED AT
986,00:35:39.53,00:35:39.53,REDEMPTION KIND THE SIX OF THEM
987,00:35:41.00,00:35:41.00,THOUGHT WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT
988,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,AND I FOUND IT TO BE OVER THE
989,00:35:44.10,00:35:44.10,TOP AND SOMEWHAT PATHETIC.
990,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,Jeff: OZZY?
991,00:35:47.50,00:35:47.50,"YEAH, IT WAS A PERFORMANCE,"
992,00:35:48.87,00:35:48.87,MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE
993,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,"LACKLUSTER, MAYBE TOO OVER THE"
994,00:35:51.87,00:35:51.87,"TOP AND YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT, I DO"
995,00:35:53.70,00:35:53.70,HAVE THE IDOL.
996,00:35:55.93,00:35:55.93,"OR RATHER, WE DO HAVE THE IDOL."
997,00:35:58.03,00:35:58.03,"AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I"
998,00:35:59.87,00:35:59.87,WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGHT FOR MY
999,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,TRIBE AND GIVE US SOME SORT OF
1000,00:36:02.63,00:36:02.63,"AN ADVANTAGE, AND IF THAT WAS"
1001,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"PATHETIC, THEN SO BE IT."
1002,00:36:05.93,00:36:05.93,Jeff: AND YOU WERE VERY
1003,00:36:07.00,00:36:07.00,"CLEAR JUST THEN, OZZY ABOUT"
1004,00:36:08.87,00:36:08.87,"SAYING, WE HAVE THE IDOL."
1005,00:36:10.33,00:36:10.33,YES.
1006,00:36:12.17,00:36:12.17,DEFINITELY FOR THIS GROUP.
1007,00:36:13.73,00:36:13.73,AND MOST LIKELY THIS VOTE.
1008,00:36:17.00,00:36:17.00,BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY
1009,00:36:18.37,00:36:18.37,"WORD FOR IT, WE CAN GO AHEAD AND"
1010,00:36:19.67,00:36:19.67,DO THIS.
1011,00:36:22.97,00:36:22.97,THAT'S IT.
1012,00:36:24.73,00:36:24.73,"Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME"
