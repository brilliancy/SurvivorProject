17,00:00:24.50,00:00:24.50,THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
18,00:00:25.60,00:00:25.60,I HAD A DREAM AND I SAW MY
19,00:00:28.37,00:00:28.37,CHANCE AT MY OWN REDEMPTION.
20,00:00:29.40,00:00:29.40,OZZY ALSO WANTED COCHRAN TO
21,00:00:32.30,00:00:32.30,BE A DOUBLE AGENT.
22,00:00:33.27,00:00:33.27,"I WILL MAKE UP A STORY,"
23,00:00:35.40,00:00:35.40,"COCHRAN IS THE SMART WEASEL, HE"

26,00:00:42.87,00:00:42.87,AND GAVE OZZY HIS IMMUNITY
27,00:00:46.90,00:00:46.90,IDOL.
28,00:00:47.60,00:00:47.60,"IN THE END, SAVAII WENT ALONG"
29,00:00:49.67,00:00:49.67,WITH THE PLAN.

32,00:00:53.93,00:00:53.93,OZZY WIN AT REDEMPTION ISLAND?
33,00:00:55.70,00:00:55.70,I AM OUT OF HERE?
34,00:00:57.40,00:00:57.40,WILL THERE BE A MERGE AND
35,00:00:59.67,00:00:59.67,CAN COCHRAN BE A MASTER SPY?
36,00:01:13.27,00:01:13.27,THE WEIRDEST MERGE IN SURVIVORHISTORY.
37,00:01:13.90,00:01:13.90,WHAT WHAT A DIFFERENCE THE
38,00:01:16.27,00:01:16.27,DAY MAKES.
39,00:01:16.97,00:01:16.97,A DAY AGO I THOUGHT I WAS
40,00:01:19.27,00:01:19.27,"GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND,"
41,00:01:20.53,00:01:20.53,WHERE I WOULD HUMILIATE MYSELF
42,00:01:22.63,00:01:22.63,AND GO HOME.
43,00:01:23.27,00:01:23.27,OZZY CAME FROM THE HEAVENS
44,00:01:25.43,00:01:25.43,AND GAVE THIS MIRACULOUS PLAN
45,00:01:27.33,00:01:27.33,WHERE HE WOULD SACRIFICE HIMSELF
46,00:01:29.77,00:01:29.77,"ON THE BASIS OF THE TRIBE, BASED"
47,00:01:31.63,00:01:31.63,ON THE MERGE THAT WILL TAKE
48,00:01:32.90,00:01:32.90,PLACE AND THE GAMBLE YOUR YOU
49,00:01:36.13,00:01:36.13,PROVE YOURSELF IN AN EXTREMELY
50,00:01:37.40,00:01:37.40,STRONG PLAYER AT REDEMPTION
51,00:01:38.77,00:01:38.77,ISLAND.
52,00:01:39.47,00:01:39.47,IF EVERYTHING CONNECTS IN THE
53,00:01:40.27,00:01:40.27,WAY WE HOPE IT WILL THIS IS
54,00:01:41.47,00:01:41.47,GOING TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS
55,00:01:42.73,00:01:42.73,ONE OF THE SINGLE BIGGEST AND
56,00:01:44.10,00:01:44.10,GREATEST MOVES IN SURVIVOR
57,00:01:45.63,00:01:45.63,HISTORY.
58,00:01:51.27,00:01:51.27,WHAT IS OUR BEST OPTION TO
59,00:01:52.67,00:01:52.67,STAY IN THE GAME?
60,00:01:56.93,00:01:56.93,I WAS WILLING TO GO.
61,00:01:59.80,00:01:59.80,YOU CAN EASILY SAY YOU ARE
62,00:02:01.57,00:02:01.57,"WILLING TO GO, BUT TO ACTUALLY"
63,00:02:02.77,00:02:02.77,"DO IT, STEP UP AND TAKE CONTROL,"
64,00:02:05.70,00:02:05.70,THAT IS DIFFERENT.
65,00:02:08.27,00:02:08.27,"THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE, I"
66,00:02:11.43,00:02:11.43,DON'T LIVE IT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
67,00:02:12.70,00:02:12.70,JUST STEP UP AND PROVE TO THE
68,00:02:14.47,00:02:14.47,WORLD WHAT YOU CAN DO.
69,00:02:15.80,00:02:15.80,WHAT CAN I DO IN TERMS OF OUR
70,00:02:18.60,00:02:18.60,PLAN IS.
71,00:02:19.17,00:02:19.17,I PRESUME IF I GO TO THE
72,00:02:21.43,00:02:21.43,OTHER SIDE THEY WILL ASK WHAT
73,00:02:23.47,00:02:23.47,BOND EXISTS BETWEEN ALL OF YOU.
74,00:02:24.80,00:02:24.80,"YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT, MAN."
75,00:02:26.77,00:02:26.77,YOU JUST HAVE TO --
76,00:02:27.70,00:02:27.70,I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
77,00:02:29.97,00:02:29.97,YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SAY.
78,00:02:31.00,00:02:31.00,ANOTHER BIG PART OF THE PLAN
79,00:02:32.53,00:02:32.53,IS THAT I BECOME THE SORT OF
80,00:02:34.73,00:02:34.73,DOUBLE AGENT WHO WILL BE ABLE TO
81,00:02:36.27,00:02:36.27,FIGURE OUT WHO THE UPOLU
82,00:02:41.27,00:02:41.27,TRIBE PLANS TO VOTE OUT
83,00:02:42.50,00:02:42.50,IN THE EVENT OF A MERGE.
84,00:02:43.80,00:02:43.80,EVERYBODY IN THIS GAME IS
85,00:02:45.43,00:02:45.43,"CAPABLE OF BEING A DOUBLE AGENT,"
86,00:02:47.53,00:02:47.53,"IF ANYBODY, IT IS ME."
87,00:02:48.40,00:02:48.40,I HAVE ALREADY BEEN
88,00:02:51.40,00:02:51.40,PRETENDING LIKE I LIKE THE

90,00:02:54.50,00:02:54.50,THINK I DESERVE AN ACADEMY AWARD
91,00:02:56.33,00:02:56.33,FOR THAT PERFORMANCE.
92,00:02:57.90,00:02:57.90,I WILL PLAY WHATEVER PART I
93,00:02:59.73,00:02:59.73,NEED TO PLAY.
94,00:03:02.10,00:03:02.10,I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT THAT
95,00:03:04.47,00:03:04.47,WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.
96,00:03:05.17,00:03:05.17,NO.
97,00:03:06.97,00:03:06.97,THAT IS SWEET.
98,00:03:09.27,00:03:09.27,THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
99,00:03:10.07,00:03:10.07,"RIGHT NOW, MY PHILOSOPHY, TO"
100,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,TAKE FROM AL PACINO.

130,00:04:24.90,00:04:24.90,AND ALL VOTED COCHRAN AND HE
131,00:04:27.20,00:04:27.20,PULLED OUT THE IDOL.
132,00:04:27.87,00:04:27.87,AND HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY?
133,00:04:29.23,00:04:29.23,NO.
134,00:04:29.80,00:04:29.80,I THINK SHE BOUGHT IT.
135,00:04:30.93,00:04:30.93,I THINK THAT SHE TOOK IT
136,00:04:33.30,00:04:33.30,"HOOK, LINE AND SINKER."
137,00:04:36.20,00:04:36.20,"I GET TAKEN OUT, I DIDN'T"

141,00:04:47.47,00:04:47.47,THIS IS PART OF THE PLAN.
142,00:04:49.87,00:04:49.87,FIRST STEP IS GETTING MYSELF
143,00:04:51.23,00:04:51.23,VOTED OUT.

149,00:05:01.67,00:05:01.67,THE STUPIDEST THING I COULD HAVE

169,00:06:04.07,00:06:04.07,AND THAT ENDS UP BEING THE
170,00:06:06.40,00:06:06.40,PERSON THAT SENDS ME HERE.
171,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,"PLAYS THE IDOL, YOU DON'T EVEN"

180,00:06:24.97,00:06:24.97,FURTHEST IN THE GAME.
181,00:06:26.50,00:06:26.50,BUT I THRIVE UNDER THE PRESSURE
182,00:06:28.03,00:06:28.03,TO COME BACK IN THE GAME FOR
183,00:06:30.23,00:06:30.23,"REVENGE, BASICALLY."

193,00:06:45.40,00:06:45.40,THE THREE KEYS OPEN THREE LOCKS.

197,00:06:55.43,00:06:55.43,FOR GOOD.
198,00:06:56.27,00:06:56.27,THERE IS ONE SIGNIFICANT
199,00:06:58.07,00:06:58.07,DIFFERENCE WITH TODAY'S DUAL.
200,00:06:59.70,00:06:59.70,THE WINNER OF THIS DUAL DOES NOT
201,00:07:01.47,00:07:01.47,GO BACK TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

214,00:07:36.07,00:07:36.07,THAT POLE.
215,00:07:37.67,00:07:37.67,IT NEEDS TO BE LONG ENOUGH AND
216,00:07:39.33,00:07:39.33,STRONG ENOUGH TO REACH THE KEYS.

691,00:26:34.37,00:26:34.37,WHERE THEY ALL LIE.
692,00:26:37.00,00:26:37.00,SOPHIE WOULD BE MY PICK.
693,00:26:39.03,00:26:39.03,IF ANYTHING IF WE ARE GOING

695,00:26:42.67,00:26:42.67,RICK.
696,00:26:43.23,00:26:43.23,I THINK WE RUN THE LEAST
697,00:26:44.37,00:26:44.37,AMOUNT OF RISK IN TERMS OF AN
698,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,IDOL PLAY IF WE GO WITH RICK.

705,00:27:03.40,00:27:03.40,EVERYBODY IS OKAY WITH
706,00:27:05.77,00:27:05.77,THROWING ROCKS.
707,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40,"KEITH, ARE YOU THROWING A ROCK?"
708,00:27:10.73,00:27:10.73,YEAH.
709,00:27:11.27,00:27:11.27,"AS OF RIGHT NOW, MY"
710,00:27:12.70,00:27:12.70,IMPRESSION IS THAT BOTH TRIBES
711,00:27:14.50,00:27:14.50,BELIEVE THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A
712,00:27:16.43,00:27:16.43,DEADLOCK AT THE VOTE.
713,00:27:17.87,00:27:17.87,NOBODY LIKES THE IDEA OF PICKING
714,00:27:21.70,00:27:21.70,ROCKS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS.
715,00:27:25.40,00:27:25.40,BUT GO SAVAII MEMBERS HAVE
716,00:27:26.80,00:27:26.80,"IMMUNITY, IT IS GREAT FOR US"
717,00:27:27.90,00:27:27.90,BECAUSE IF IT COMES DOWN TO A
718,00:27:29.57,00:27:29.57,PICK EM THERE ARE TEN PICKS AND
719,00:27:32.27,00:27:32.27,ONLY FOUR OF US ON THE CHOPPING
720,00:27:33.90,00:27:33.90,BLOCK AND SIX OF THEM.
721,00:27:34.57,00:27:34.57,SO YOU AND I ARE OUT OF THE
722,00:27:36.00,00:27:36.00,VOTE.
723,00:27:36.63,00:27:36.63,WE ARE OUT OF THE VOTE AND
724,00:27:37.90,00:27:37.90,WHOEVER PLAYS THE IDOL IS OUT OF
725,00:27:39.40,00:27:39.40,THE VOTE.
726,00:27:40.60,00:27:40.60,THEY WOULD NEVER THINK THAT
727,00:27:42.37,00:27:42.37,WHITNEY WOULD HAVE IT.
728,00:27:43.00,00:27:43.00,NOT EVER.
729,00:27:44.17,00:27:44.17,WHICH MEANS I PRETTY MUCH
730,00:27:47.47,00:27:47.47,BASICALLY HAVE TO PLAY THE IDOL.
731,00:27:48.37,00:27:48.37,I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO
732,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,VOTE FOR WHITNEY.
733,00:27:51.37,00:27:51.37,WHY? BECAUSE IF IT GOES TO
734,00:27:53.07,00:27:53.07,"ROCKS, WHITNEY IS IMMUNE FROM"
735,00:27:54.40,00:27:54.40,THE ROCKS AND THEY WANT TO HAVE
736,00:27:55.67,00:27:55.67,SOME OF THE STRONGER PLAYERS IN
737,00:27:57.37,00:27:57.37,"THERE, ME AND KEITH, AND IN"
738,00:27:58.90,00:27:58.90,"THEIR MINDS, THEY CAN GET RID OF"
739,00:28:01.37,00:28:01.37,WHITNEY LATER.
740,00:28:02.03,00:28:02.03,"DO WE WANT TO HAVE COCHRAN,"
741,00:28:04.37,00:28:04.37,"THEN, STILL BE A LITTLE WAFFLY"
742,00:28:07.23,00:28:07.23,TODAY?
743,00:28:07.90,00:28:07.90,IF THEY TELL ME MIGHT BE TO
744,00:28:10.70,00:28:10.70,VOTE FOR THEN WE KNOW THAT'S NOT
745,00:28:12.67,00:28:12.67,WHO THEY ARE VOTING FOR.
746,00:28:13.57,00:28:13.57,SAVAII MAY FEEL CONFIDENT
747,00:28:16.03,00:28:16.03,THAT WE HAVE A THREE OUT OF
748,00:28:17.20,00:28:17.20,EIGHT SHOT OR WHATEVER THE
749,00:28:18.17,00:28:18.17,"NUMBERS ARE, BUT THOSE NUMBERS"
750,00:28:19.87,00:28:19.87,"AREN'T THAT REASSURING TO ME,"
751,00:28:21.87,00:28:21.87,EVEN IF IT IS ONE OUT OF 30 THAT
752,00:28:23.57,00:28:23.57,A ROCK WOULD SEND ME HOME I
753,00:28:25.03,00:28:25.03,WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT.
754,00:28:25.87,00:28:25.87,THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS GAME IS
755,00:28:27.13,00:28:27.13,ABOUT.
756,00:28:27.80,00:28:27.80,I LOVE THIS GAME AND RESPECT

758,00:28:30.27,00:28:30.27,REDUCING MY GAME TO A GAME OF
759,00:28:31.70,00:28:31.70,CHANCE AND PULLING A ROCK OUT OF
760,00:28:33.23,00:28:33.23,A BAG.
761,00:28:37.37,00:28:37.37,"WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS,"
762,00:28:38.53,00:28:38.53,THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR RICK.
763,00:28:41.40,00:28:41.40,ORIGINALLY IT WAS GOING TO BE
764,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,YOU.
765,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
766,00:28:45.13,00:28:45.13,ME.
767,00:28:45.70,00:28:45.70,"THE LAST SECOND, OZZY IS"
768,00:28:47.23,00:28:47.23,"GOING TO STAND UP, GIVE -- I"
769,00:28:53.60,00:28:53.60,"MEAN, HAVE LIKE RICK PLAY IDOL"
770,00:28:55.70,00:28:55.70,AND --
771,00:28:56.00,00:28:56.00,RIGHT.
772,00:28:58.80,00:28:58.80,"I UNDERSTAND, BUT I THINK THAT"
773,00:29:01.47,00:29:01.47,THIS IS SURVIVOR.
774,00:29:02.23,00:29:02.23,I TRUST YOU.
775,00:29:04.97,00:29:04.97,BUT HAVE GOT TO REALIZE WHERE WE
776,00:29:06.43,00:29:06.43,ARE KOCHING FROM.
777,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,"I DO, I DO."
778,00:29:11.37,00:29:11.37,I HOPE -- DON'T DO ME ANY
779,00:29:21.10,00:29:21.10,FAVORS.
780,00:29:21.80,00:29:21.80,DON'T LET ME GET EATEN ALIVE.
781,00:29:23.37,00:29:23.37,I KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE --
782,00:29:26.17,00:29:26.17,"YEAH, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE"
783,00:29:27.87,00:29:27.87,FUN.
784,00:29:28.43,00:29:28.43,YOU CAN NEVER COUNT ON
785,00:29:29.57,00:29:29.57,SOMEONE COMING OVER AND NEVER
786,00:29:30.57,00:29:30.57,KNOW FOR SURE.
787,00:29:31.60,00:29:31.60,"THAT SAID, I THINK I FEEL AS"
788,00:29:34.63,00:29:34.63,CONFIDENT ABOUT COCHRAN FLING
789,00:29:36.10,00:29:36.10,"OVER, BECAUSE COCHRAN THINKS IF"
790,00:29:37.37,00:29:37.37,HE PUSHES AND COMES BACK TO CAMP
791,00:29:39.20,00:29:39.20,"HE IS GOING TO GET BEAT UP,"
792,00:29:40.50,00:29:40.50,WHICH IS A LEGITIMATE THING FOR
793,00:29:42.70,00:29:42.70,A TARGET TO BE AFRAID OF.
794,00:29:50.70,00:29:50.70,THEY ARE GOING TO KILL ME
795,00:29:52.37,00:29:52.37,TONIGHT.
796,00:29:53.10,00:29:53.10,THEY ARE GOING TO EAT ME ALIVE.
797,00:29:54.73,00:29:54.73,THAT IS WHAT I AM DREADING.
798,00:29:56.37,00:29:56.37,I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO EAT
799,00:29:58.20,00:29:58.20,THEM ALIVE.
800,00:29:58.87,00:29:58.87,WHERE AM I SLEEPING TONIGHT?
801,00:30:00.83,00:30:00.83,RIGHT BETWEEN ME AND EDNA.

805,00:30:09.37,00:30:09.37,TWISTS BUT TO FLUS COCHRAN
806,00:30:10.60,00:30:10.60,BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE NOT IN OUR

821,00:30:45.50,00:30:45.50,"OH, I AM -- I WON'T SAY A"
822,00:30:48.43,00:30:48.43,THING.
823,00:30:49.13,00:30:49.13,I AM JUST GOING TO LET YOU PLAY.
824,00:30:52.67,00:30:52.67,THAT IS MY PRELIMINARY PLAN.
825,00:30:54.53,00:30:54.53,I MEAN THERE ARE A FEW OUTS.
826,00:30:57.73,00:30:57.73,"BEFORE THE CHALLENGE, I JUST"
827,00:31:00.00,00:31:00.00,"THOUGHT, TO ME, THIS IS LIKE"

829,00:31:03.00,00:31:03.00,HOW YOU REMEDY SOMETHING.
830,00:31:05.90,00:31:05.90,I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES.
831,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,"THEY ARE PROMISES, THOUGH."
832,00:31:08.40,00:31:08.40,WHY WOULD THEY WATCH OUT FOR
833,00:31:10.40,00:31:10.40,YOU OVER THEIR OWN PEOPLE.
834,00:31:11.37,00:31:11.37,IF THEY HAVE TWO OF THEIR
835,00:31:13.43,00:31:13.43,PEOPLE WINNING IMMUNITY TODAY
836,00:31:14.77,00:31:14.77,THEY WOULDN'T BE TALKING TO YOU.
837,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,DAWN APPARENTLY IS NOW
838,00:31:19.37,00:31:19.37,UNWILLING TO FLIP HER VOTE
839,00:31:21.37,00:31:21.37,"ALONGSIDE ME AND UPOLU, IT GIVES"
840,00:31:22.57,00:31:22.57,ME SOME PAUSE IN DEBATING
841,00:31:23.93,00:31:23.93,WHETHER OR NOT I WANT TO MAKE
842,00:31:24.90,00:31:24.90,"THE JUMP, BUT IT IS A TOUGH"
843,00:31:27.17,00:31:27.17,"CHOICE, SHOULD GUY WITH A BUNCH"

848,00:31:38.37,00:31:38.37,BECAUSE I WILL CAUSE SO MANY
849,00:31:39.60,00:31:39.60,PEOPLE TO BE FURIOUS AT ME.
850,00:31:40.80,00:31:40.80,I TOTALLY WILL PLAY YOUR GAME
851,00:31:43.37,00:31:43.37,I AM TELLING YOU WHAT GOES

855,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO
856,00:31:50.90,00:31:50.90,AFFECT EVERYTHING.
857,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,THERE IS NO WAY THAT --
858,00:31:54.13,00:31:54.13,"THE RUDENESS, THE LACK OF"
859,00:31:55.90,00:31:55.90,"COURTESY, THE LACK OF RESPECT --"
860,00:31:58.37,00:31:58.37,I WANT TO BE IN CONTROL FOR
861,00:31:59.70,00:31:59.70,THE FIRST TIME IN MY GAME.
862,00:32:01.27,00:32:01.27,I FEEL LIKE I AM BY SAYING
863,00:32:03.03,00:32:03.03,YOU KNOW WHAT? I WON'T TAKE
864,00:32:04.23,00:32:04.23,YOUR CRAP.
865,00:32:06.43,00:32:06.43,"LOOK, IT IS NOT ABOUT THAT AT"
866,00:32:08.40,00:32:08.40,THIS POINT.
867,00:32:08.87,00:32:08.87,IT IS ABOUT THAT.
868,00:32:10.60,00:32:10.60,"TO ME, YOU ARE APPEALING TO YOUR"
869,00:32:13.03,00:32:13.03,EMOTION.
870,00:32:13.60,00:32:13.60,I AM AN EMOTIONAL GUY.
871,00:32:15.73,00:32:15.73,"OH, BEFORE I WENT TO THE"
872,00:32:19.00,00:32:19.00,"CHALLENGE, I REALLY SPENT SOME"
873,00:32:20.10,00:32:20.10,"TIME LIKE LITERALLY PRAYING, I"
874,00:32:21.87,00:32:21.87,KNOW IT SOUNDS CLICHE BUT I KIND
875,00:32:23.87,00:32:23.87,OF BACKED OFF MY ORIGINAL
876,00:32:25.40,00:32:25.40,FEELING OF MAYBE I SHOULD FLIP
877,00:32:26.77,00:32:26.77,"WITH COCHRAN, BECAUSE I REALIZED"
878,00:32:29.67,00:32:29.67,"I HAVE LIKED MY TRIBE, IT HASN'T"
879,00:32:31.67,00:32:31.67,BEEN AS KUMBAYA AS I THINK THE
880,00:32:33.50,00:32:33.50,OTHER TRIBE BUT THERE ARE THINGS
881,00:32:34.80,00:32:34.80,ABOUT EACH OF THOSE PEOPLE I
882,00:32:35.93,00:32:35.93,LOVE AND I HAVE HAD GREAT
883,00:32:37.10,00:32:37.10,EXPERIENCES WITH THEM AND I
884,00:32:38.07,00:32:38.07,"DON'T WANT TO GO BACK ON THAT, I"
885,00:32:39.60,00:32:39.60,WANT TO STAY LOYAL TO THE TRIBE.
886,00:32:41.60,00:32:41.60,"HOW ARE YOU DOING, BRO?"
887,00:32:44.10,00:32:44.10,WE ARE ALMOST THERE.
888,00:32:46.87,00:32:46.87,GET BACK IN THE FOLD.
889,00:32:47.90,00:32:47.90,I HAVEN'T TALKED TO THE REST
890,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,OF THE TRIBE BECAUSE I CAN
891,00:32:51.00,00:32:51.00,UNDERSTAND WHY HE IS BEHALFING
892,00:32:52.03,00:32:52.03,BUT I AM PRAYING HE DOESN'T AND
893,00:32:53.57,00:32:53.57,I HAVE LET HIM KNOW I AM
894,00:32:55.37,00:32:55.37,"DISAPPOINTED, I DON'T THINK IT"
895,00:32:56.03,00:32:56.03,"IS RIGHT TO PHLEGM, I DON'T."
896,00:32:57.23,00:32:57.23,AND I FEEL LIKE HE IS WATCHING
897,00:32:58.57,00:32:58.57,OUT FOR HIMSELF TONIGHT AND NO
898,00:33:00.03,00:33:00.03,"ONE ELSE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO"
899,00:33:01.37,00:33:01.37,"TELL EVERYBODY, BECAUSE I THINK"
900,00:33:03.23,00:33:03.23,THERE IS HOPE THAT HE IS GOING
901,00:33:04.43,00:33:04.43,"TO NOT DO DO IT, I HAVE LET HIM"
902,00:33:05.57,00:33:05.57,"KNOW, I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT."
903,00:33:24.67,00:33:24.67,"SO, COACH, SIX FORMER SAVAII,"
904,00:33:27.90,00:33:27.90,"SIX FORMER UPOLU, IF YOU WERE"
905,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,GOING TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION IT
906,00:33:30.13,00:33:30.13,SEEMS THAT WE MIGHT BE LOOKING
907,00:33:31.53,00:33:31.53,AT A TIE VOTE TONIGHT.
908,00:33:33.93,00:33:33.93,THAT IS CORRECT WE WILL BE
909,00:33:35.47,00:33:35.47,PUTTING ALL OF THE CARDS ON
910,00:33:36.50,00:33:36.50,TABLE TONIGHT.
911,00:33:37.60,00:33:37.60,AND YOU WILL SEE MOST LIKELY SIX
912,00:33:41.73,00:33:41.73,AND SIX.
913,00:33:42.30,00:33:42.30,"Jeff: OZZY, RING TRUE TO"
914,00:33:43.37,00:33:43.37,YOU?
915,00:33:43.67,00:33:43.67,YEAH.
916,00:33:45.13,00:33:45.13,DEFINITELY.
917,00:33:45.80,00:33:45.80,WE WENT INTO THIS CHALLENGE
918,00:33:46.73,00:33:46.73,TODAY KNOWING WE REALLY NEEDED
919,00:33:48.40,00:33:48.40,TO GET BOTH OF THE IMMUNITY
920,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,NECKLACES BECAUSE CHANCES WERE
921,00:33:52.60,00:33:52.60,WE ARE GOING TO TIE UP AND IT
922,00:33:54.70,00:33:54.70,WAS GOING TO GO TO ROCKS AND IF
923,00:33:56.20,00:33:56.20,"IT DOES, WE BETTER HAVE THE ODDS"
924,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,"ON OUR SIDE, AND WE ARE ALL"
925,00:34:01.13,00:34:01.13,"GOING TO BE SAFE, I GUESS."
926,00:34:04.57,00:34:04.57,Jeff: AND THE REASON THE
927,00:34:05.50,00:34:05.50,"STAKES ARE SO HIGH, DAWN,"
928,00:34:08.73,00:34:08.73,BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO A TIE AND
929,00:34:10.27,00:34:10.27,WE VOTE AGAIN AND YOU ARE STILL
930,00:34:12.10,00:34:12.10,TIED THE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE
931,00:34:13.47,00:34:13.47,VOTES ARE IMMUNE AND EVERYBODY
932,00:34:14.87,00:34:14.87,ELSE IS DRAWING ROCKS WHICH IS A
933,00:34:16.77,00:34:16.77,BIG RISK.
934,00:34:17.47,00:34:17.47,BIG SEX.
935,00:34:18.07,00:34:18.07,IT IS WORTH A BIG RISK.
936,00:34:20.00,00:34:20.00,SO THE ONLY WAY TO BREAK UP A
937,00:34:22.20,00:34:22.20,TIE IS SOMEBODY HAS TO DEFECT TO
938,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,THE OTHER TRIBE.
939,00:34:26.20,00:34:26.20,"EDNA, CAN YOU SEE ANY SCENARIO"
940,00:34:28.33,00:34:28.33,THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR
941,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,SOMEBODY TO SWITCH?
942,00:34:31.70,00:34:31.70,IF THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL DIDN'T
943,00:34:35.10,00:34:35.10,FEEL INCORPORATED OR A PART OF
944,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20,"THAT TRIBE, THAT WOULD BE ONE"
945,00:34:40.17,00:34:40.17,REASON.
946,00:34:40.83,00:34:40.83,Jeff: COCHRAN YOU HAVE SAID
947,00:34:41.57,00:34:41.57,IT MANY TIMES YOU ARE A STUDENT
948,00:34:42.63,00:34:42.63,OF THE GAME.
949,00:34:43.43,00:34:43.43,WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT YOU WOULD
950,00:34:45.47,00:34:45.47,HAVE TWO TRIBES THIS UNIFIED?
951,00:34:46.87,00:34:46.87,I HAVE NEVER SEEN TWO TRIBES
952,00:34:48.93,00:34:48.93,THAT SEEM SO ENTIRELY COHESIVE
953,00:34:51.37,00:34:51.37,"IN THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS, IN"
954,00:34:53.00,00:34:53.00,"TERMS OF ODDS, I DON'T KNOW"
955,00:34:54.37,00:34:54.37,"ODDS, I DON'T DO ODDS, I DO"
956,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,SURVIVOR.
957,00:34:58.27,00:34:58.27,"Jeff: JIM, WHAT ARE THE"
958,00:34:59.43,00:34:59.43,CHANCES SOMEBODY FROM YOUR TRIBE
959,00:35:00.87,00:35:00.87,WALKS OVER AND JOINS THEIR
960,00:35:02.30,00:35:02.30,TRIBE?
961,00:35:02.93,00:35:02.93,"ZERO, IT MAKES NO SENSE WE"
962,00:35:04.63,00:35:04.63,"HAVE THE NUMBERS ON OUR SIDE, IT"
963,00:35:06.50,00:35:06.50,DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR ONE
964,00:35:08.10,00:35:08.10,OF US TO DO THAT.
965,00:35:09.10,00:35:09.10,Jeff: ALBERT IS THERE MUCH
966,00:35:10.63,00:35:10.63,"TALK ABOUT THE IDOL, WHETHER"
967,00:35:11.87,00:35:11.87,EACH TRIBE MAY HAVE FOUND AN
968,00:35:14.87,00:35:14.87,IDOL.
969,00:35:15.50,00:35:15.50,WE WERE ALL PRESENT AT THE
970,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,DUAL AND OZZY DID HIS BEST
971,00:35:18.00,00:35:18.00,BROADWAY PRODUCTION TO SEE HOW
972,00:35:19.70,00:35:19.70,HE FELT BACK STAB AND HURT ABOUT
973,00:35:21.33,00:35:21.33,THE IDOL AND TIME TO FIND OUT IF
974,00:35:22.93,00:35:22.93,"THAT WAS ALL A SHOW, BECAUSE IF"
975,00:35:24.87,00:35:24.87,THEY HAVE AN IDOL THAT THEY
976,00:35:26.87,00:35:26.87,"PLAY, THAT MEANS THERE WASN'T"
977,00:35:27.87,00:35:27.87,REALLY AN IDOL PLAYED AT THEIR
978,00:35:30.03,00:35:30.03,ORIGINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
979,00:35:31.23,00:35:31.23,"Jeff: SOPHIE, IS IT A"
980,00:35:33.10,00:35:33.10,CONSENSUS OZZY WASN'T TELLING
981,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,THE TRUTH OR IS IT A QUESTION
982,00:35:36.23,00:35:36.23,AND YOU ARE HOPING TO FIND OUT
983,00:35:37.70,00:35:37.70,TONIGHT?
984,00:35:38.33,00:35:38.33,I WAS ACTUALLY OFFENDED AT
985,00:35:39.53,00:35:39.53,REDEMPTION KIND THE SIX OF THEM
986,00:35:41.00,00:35:41.00,THOUGHT WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT
987,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,AND I FOUND IT TO BE OVER THE
988,00:35:44.10,00:35:44.10,TOP AND SOMEWHAT PATHETIC.
989,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,Jeff: OZZY?
990,00:35:47.50,00:35:47.50,"YEAH, IT WAS A PERFORMANCE,"
991,00:35:48.87,00:35:48.87,MAYBE IT WAS A LITTLE
992,00:35:50.90,00:35:50.90,"LACKLUSTER, MAYBE TOO OVER THE"
993,00:35:51.87,00:35:51.87,"TOP AND YOU GUYS ARE RIGHT, I DO"
994,00:35:53.70,00:35:53.70,HAVE THE IDOL.
995,00:35:55.93,00:35:55.93,"OR RATHER, WE DO HAVE THE IDOL."
996,00:35:58.03,00:35:58.03,"AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, I"
997,00:35:59.87,00:35:59.87,WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGHT FOR MY
998,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,TRIBE AND GIVE US SOME SORT OF
999,00:36:02.63,00:36:02.63,"AN ADVANTAGE, AND IF THAT WAS"
1000,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"PATHETIC, THEN SO BE IT."
1001,00:36:05.93,00:36:05.93,Jeff: AND YOU WERE VERY
1002,00:36:07.00,00:36:07.00,"CLEAR JUST THEN, OZZY ABOUT"
1003,00:36:08.87,00:36:08.87,"SAYING, WE HAVE THE IDOL."
1004,00:36:10.33,00:36:10.33,YES.
1005,00:36:12.17,00:36:12.17,DEFINITELY FOR THIS GROUP.
1006,00:36:13.73,00:36:13.73,AND MOST LIKELY THIS VOTE.
1007,00:36:17.00,00:36:17.00,BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY
1008,00:36:18.37,00:36:18.37,"WORD FOR IT, WE CAN GO AHEAD AND"
1009,00:36:19.67,00:36:19.67,DO THIS.
1010,00:36:22.97,00:36:22.97,THAT'S IT.
1011,00:36:24.73,00:36:24.73,"Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME"
