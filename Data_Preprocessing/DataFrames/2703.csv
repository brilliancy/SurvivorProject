200,00:11:12.60,00:11:12.60,THESE TRIP BARS MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT.
201,00:11:14.73,00:11:14.73,YOU CAN'T JUST RACE UP AND DOWN. IT IS A VERY HOT 114 DEGREES OUT
202,00:11:21.67,00:11:21.67,HERE TODAY. THAT MAKES CONCENTRATING THAT
203,00:11:25.23,00:11:25.23,MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WHERE CONCENTRATION IS KEY.

210,00:12:10.67,00:12:10.67,SHE'S VERY CLOSE CANDICE WINS HER SECOND DUEL!
211,00:12:17.93,00:12:17.93,CANDICE STAYS ALIVE AT REDEMPTION ISLAND.

216,00:12:29.87,00:12:29.87,SHE'S GOT TO RESTACK. THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR RACHEL.
217,00:12:34.63,00:12:34.63,"RACHEL BUMP IT IS TRIP BAR, LOSES NEARLY HER ENTIRE STACK."
218,00:12:37.60,00:12:37.60,>> THAT'S OKAY. RESTACK.

234,00:13:32.17,00:13:32.17,BLOCKS AWAY FROM GOING AGAIN. >> THIS IS INTENSE.
235,00:13:35.93,00:13:35.93,">> GERV, I'M ABOUT TO PASS OUT. >> YOU'VE GOT IT."
236,00:13:39.37,00:13:39.37,ALL YOU CAN DO IS STACK THE FRONT.
237,00:13:41.07,00:13:41.07,IT'S OVER. THERE YOU GO.
238,00:13:42.43,00:13:42.43,>> Jeff: MARISSA IS VERY CLOSE TO GIVING IT AGO AGAIN.

241,00:13:57.43,00:13:57.43,>> Jeff: THIS COULD COME DOWN TO A FEW PIECES BETWEEN RACHEL

258,00:14:49.90,00:14:49.90,ONE OF THE HOST HARD-FOUGHT DUELS I'VE EVER SEEN.
259,00:14:53.73,00:14:53.73,"CANDICE, YOU STAY ALIVE. MARISSA, YOU STAY ALIVE."
260,00:14:58.17,00:14:58.17,"RACHEL, AFTER SEVEN DAYS, YOUR TIME ON ""SURVIVOR"" IS OVER."
261,00:15:01.80,00:15:01.80,TOSS YOUR BUFF IN THE URN ON THE WAY OUT.

266,00:15:23.27,00:15:23.27,DECIDE WHO GETS THE CLUE TO THE LOCATION OF A HIDDEN IMMUNITY
267,00:15:27.20,00:15:27.20,IDOL. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
268,00:15:28.67,00:15:28.67,">> JOHN, TAKE CLUE AND DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WITH IT."
269,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,>> Jeff: JOHN WILL GET THE SECOND CLUE TO THE LOCATION OF A
270,00:15:35.27,00:15:35.27,HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL. IF HE HASN'T FOUND IT THIS WILL
271,00:15:38.47,00:15:38.47,"HELP HIM GET CLOSER PHAFPLT REUSZ A, CANDICE."
272,00:15:40.97,00:15:40.97,YOU'RE THAT MUCH CLOSER TO A SECOND SHOT AT REENTERING THE
273,00:15:43.77,00:15:43.77,GAME. GRAB YOUR STUFF AND HEAD BACK TO
274,00:15:45.83,00:15:45.83,REDEMPTION ISLAND. AWAIT YOUR NEXT DUEL.
275,00:15:47.53,00:15:47.53,">> GOOD LUCK, GIRLS, OVER THERE. >> HYDRATE, YOU GUYS."
276,00:15:51.60,00:15:51.60,"HYDRATE. >> Jeff: GUYS, HEAD BACK TO"

278,00:16:12.80,00:16:12.80,"HOW DO YOU FEEL? >> OKAY, I GUESS."
279,00:16:15.17,00:16:15.17,I'M FINE. IT WAS HARD TO SEE RACHEL AT
280,00:16:18.10,00:16:18.10,REDEMPTION. I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO BE
281,00:16:19.67,00:16:19.67,THERE. IT WAS THE ONLY MOVE FOR THEM
282,00:16:21.33,00:16:21.33,"THAT MADE SENSE, REALLY, IF THEY WANTED TO TRY AND WIN"
283,00:16:24.80,00:16:24.80,CHALLENGES. SO NOW I HAVE TO GET ALL THE WAY
284,00:16:26.70,00:16:26.70,TO THE END OR I WOULD REGRET NOT STEPPING IN FOR RACHEL.
285,00:16:31.13,00:16:31.13,">> I THOUGHT YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU."
286,00:16:33.90,00:16:33.90,>> WHEN SHE LOST AND I GOT TO HUG HER I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD
287,00:16:37.63,00:16:37.63,FUN AND SHE SAID SHE DID AND FOR ME THAT WAS ENOUGH.
288,00:16:40.27,00:16:40.27,"BECAUSE IT IS A GAME, YOU KNOW? TOO MANY PEOPLE TAKE IT TOO"
289,00:16:43.33,00:16:43.33,SERIOUS AND IT SHOULDN'T BE. AND IT RUINS THEIR LIVES AND IT
290,00:16:46.73,00:16:46.73,MAKES THEM ANGRY AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS COLTON.
291,00:16:50.87,00:16:50.87,>> WE'RE DOWN A MAN. >> WHY'D HE QUIT?
292,00:16:53.97,00:16:53.97,"LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED? >> BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE"
293,00:16:55.50,00:16:55.50,"CONTROL OF ALL OF US. LIKE, HE THOUGHT HE COULD."
294,00:16:58.90,00:16:58.90,">> BECAUSE EVERY PERSON HE TALKED TO SAID ""I DON'T WANT TO"
295,00:17:01.90,00:17:01.90,"TALK STRATEGY TO YOU"" SO HE WAS LIKE HOW CAN I PLAY THIS GAME?"
296,00:17:05.90,00:17:05.90,AND RATHER THAN BIDE HIS TIME AND WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO
297,00:17:08.70,00:17:08.70,"SOMETHING HE WAS LIKE ""I QUIT."" >> I THINK I CAN ONLY REMEMBER"
298,00:17:12.83,00:17:12.83,ALL THESE (BLEEP). >> THAT WAS A STRONG ATTACK ON
299,00:17:15.00,00:17:15.00,THE CULPEPPER NAME. >> RIGHT NOW BEING HERE WITH
300,00:17:18.53,00:17:18.53,"MONICA IS A LITTLE WEIRD. I MEAN, WHO WOULDN'T BE BOTHERED"
301,00:17:21.80,00:17:21.80,BY THAT. I KNOW HER HUSBAND WAS THE MAIN
302,00:17:23.83,00:17:23.83,REASON RACHEL GOT VOTED OUT BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE
303,00:17:27.60,00:17:27.60,GAME. ALL HE'S DOING IS CREATING A
304,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,"LARGER TARGET ON HIS BACK. >> WELL, THAT WAS UNEVENTFUL."
305,00:17:37.37,00:17:37.37,>> WOW. THAT'S CRAZY.
306,00:17:39.03,00:17:39.03,>> AM I BEING A TYRANT? I DON'T KNOW.
307,00:17:41.23,00:17:41.23,">> NO, YOU'RE NOT. DON'T WORRY."
308,00:17:42.90,00:17:42.90,>> HE CALLED ME OUT. IT WAS LIKE -- THAT'S THE WHOLE
309,00:17:45.27,00:17:45.27,DEAL WITH GOING TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
310,00:17:47.30,00:17:47.30,IN THE PAST YOU VOTE SOMETHING OFF AND THEIR DIRTY LAUNDRY GOES
311,00:17:49.63,00:17:49.63,WITH THEM. >> EXACTLY.
312,00:17:50.70,00:17:50.70,>> NOW YOU VOTE SOMEBODY OFF AND THE DIRTY LAUNDRY COMES BACK AT
313,00:17:54.13,00:17:54.13,YOU. AT REDEMPTION WE WALK IN AND ALL
314,00:17:56.50,00:17:56.50,OF A SUDDEN WHAM! TYSON STARTED BLAMING ME FOR
315,00:17:59.90,00:17:59.90,GETTING RID OF HIS GIRL. THEN MARISSA DIRECTED
316,00:18:03.83,00:18:03.83,VULGARITIES ABOUT ME ABOUT ME RULING THE ROOST AND MAKING THE
317,00:18:08.80,00:18:08.80,DECISIONS. I AM BUT I'M MAKING EVERYONE
318,00:18:11.30,00:18:11.30,"ELSE FEEL THAT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AS A GROUP, NOT BY"
319,00:18:15.40,00:18:15.40,ME. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ME AT ALL.
320,00:18:17.77,00:18:17.77,">> HE'S A SOLID DUDE, MAN. HE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD A TEAM."
321,00:18:20.73,00:18:20.73,>> EVERYBODY'S MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE OF BRAD.
322,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77,>> I LOVE ALL OF YOU GUYS. IT'S LIKE WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
323,00:18:27.07,00:18:27.07,DROPPED IN A BETTER POSITION. >> CANDICE KICKED ASS AGAIN AT
324,00:18:53.37,00:18:53.37,THE DUEL WHICH WAS GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE I GOT ANOTHER CLUE TO
325,00:18:56.27,00:18:56.27,THE IMMUNITY IDOL AND IT'S SORT OF A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD BECAUSE
326,00:19:01.23,00:19:01.23,EVERYONE WILL ASSUME I FOUND IT SO I'LL HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK
327,00:19:04.27,00:19:04.27,WHETHER I FIND IT OR NOT. >> I FEEL BET WE ARE THE SECOND
328,00:19:08.00,00:19:08.00,CLUE THAN I DID ABOUT THE FIRST. >> ORIGIN 23458LY I WASN'T GOING
329,00:19:12.60,00:19:12.60,TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THE CLUE BUT I LIKE BRAD A LOT AND I
330,00:19:15.17,00:19:15.17,DIDN'T WANT HIM TO THINK I WAS BEING SHADY AND START BEING
331,00:19:17.87,00:19:17.87,"PARANOID ABOUT OUR ALLIANCE. >> AT THIS POINT, I'VE GOT SUCH"
332,00:19:50.63,00:19:50.63,A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME THE CLUE TO THE
333,00:19:54.30,00:19:54.30,HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND I WANTED TO HELP HIM FIND IT BUT
334,00:19:58.30,00:19:58.30,JOHN SAID WE SHOULDN'T GO TOGETHER BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO
335,00:20:01.23,00:20:01.23,"SEEM TOO OBVIOUS AND I'M THINKING, HMM, OKAY, I DON'T"
336,00:20:04.03,00:20:04.03,KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. DOES HE TRUST ME OR NOT?
337,00:20:06.33,00:20:06.33,>> I'LL FIND IT. >> I AGREE.
338,00:20:08.53,00:20:08.53,YOU GO. YOU'RE THE LEADER ON THIS DEAL.
339,00:20:10.50,00:20:10.50,>> LET ME FIND IT. >> THIS IS GOING TO BE A LITMUS
340,00:20:13.40,00:20:13.40,TEST WITH JOHN AND I. IS JOHN WITH ME?
341,00:20:15.43,00:20:15.43,"IS HE MY GUY OR IS HE NOT? BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T TRUST ME,"
342,00:20:18.87,00:20:18.87,I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST HIM. >> Jeff: TREEMAIL!
343,00:20:33.40,00:20:33.40,">> TODAY? >> OH, BOY."
344,00:20:34.37,00:20:34.37,">> A CHALLENGE? >> PUSHING, SHOVING, THRASHING,"
345,00:20:39.20,00:20:39.20,BASHING. THIS IS NO REGULAR PILLOW FIGHT.
346,00:20:42.03,00:20:42.03,>> WE'RE FIGHTING! >> KNOCK YOUR LOVED ONES IN THE
347,00:20:46.33,00:20:46.33,DRINK OR YOU MAY JUST GO HOME TONIGHT.
348,00:20:52.17,00:20:52.17,>> WOW. >> WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO GO
349,00:20:57.13,00:20:57.13,AGAINST? >> I'D LIKE TO GO AGAINST VYTAS.
350,00:21:00.37,00:21:00.37,WE GET TREEMAIL AND THIS IS HUGE BECAUSE MY BROTHER HAS BEEN A
351,00:21:03.07,00:21:03.07,"BULLY IN MY LIFE, TO PUT IT SIMPLY."
352,00:21:05.53,00:21:05.53,"WHEN I WAS A KID, MY BROTHER NEVER LOOKED OUT FOR ME."
353,00:21:08.07,00:21:08.07,IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MOM'S NOT LOOKING SO IF HE COULD GET A
354,00:21:10.93,00:21:10.93,PUNCH IN HE WAS GOING TO TAKE IT.
355,00:21:12.83,00:21:12.83,BUT THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US TO COMPETE ON AN EVEN PLAYING
356,00:21:18.63,00:21:18.63,FIELD. >> I THINK ANY ADVICE YOU WOULD
357,00:21:20.47,00:21:20.47,HAVE? >> DON'T GET OVEREXTENDED.
358,00:21:22.60,00:21:22.60,"THE KEY IS BALANCE. YES, YES, LIKE BOXING, LIKE PEW."
359,00:21:28.13,00:21:28.13,>> GO EASY ON ME. >> I CAN'T SAY I WAS A GREAT
360,00:21:31.40,00:21:31.40,OLDER BROTHER TO ARAS BUT THE TRUTH IS HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

543,00:32:40.00,00:32:40.00,ANY CHALLENGE AND SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING AROUND CAMP SO TO ME I
544,00:32:42.93,00:32:42.93,DON'T THINK SHE'S HELPING US THAT MUCH.
545,00:32:44.40,00:32:44.40,>> I'M DOWN TO GO WITH WHATEVER. IF IT'S CIERA FINE.
546,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,>> I WANT IT TO BE DONE AND LET'S ENJOY THE AFTERNOON AS
547,00:32:50.10,00:32:50.10,BEST WE CAN. >> WE HAVE THE FIVE-GUY ALLIANCE
548,00:32:52.87,00:32:52.87,SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT TONIGHT.
549,00:32:54.73,00:32:54.73,IT'S GOING TO BE CIERA GOING HOME BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
550,00:32:57.17,00:32:57.17,"BECAUSE THIS IS ""SURVIVOR"" SUR SO I HAVE TWO CLUES TO A HIDDEN"
551,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,IMMUNITY IDOL AND IF I CAN FIND THE THING I'LL PUT MYSELF IN A
552,00:33:04.83,00:33:04.83,"GOOD POSITION. >> LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL: JOHN,"
553,00:33:08.57,00:33:08.57,"HE'S A STRONG PLAYER, HE NEEDS TO GO."
554,00:33:10.97,00:33:10.97,BECAUSE JOHN CAN RECONNECT WITH CANDICE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
555,00:33:14.03,00:33:14.03,HAVE THOSE TWO BACK IN THE GAME. COMING BACK FROM THE CHALLENGE
556,00:33:17.53,00:33:17.53,MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE CHANGED. THAT'S WHEN THE LIGHTBULB WENT
557,00:33:22.37,00:33:22.37,BING. HERE'S THE DEAL: I'M RUNNING OUR
558,00:33:24.37,00:33:24.37,TRIBE RIGHT NOW BUT JOHN'S WIFE CANDICE IS KICKING IT AT
559,00:33:28.47,00:33:28.47,REDEMPTION ISLAND AND LET'S SAY SHE GETS BACK IN THE GAME.
560,00:33:31.50,00:33:31.50,"IF WE GO TO A MERGE AND THEY'RE RECONNECTED, BRAD DOESN'T"
561,00:33:34.67,00:33:34.67,"CONTROL JOHN ANYMORE, CANDICE CONTROLS JOHN."
562,00:33:37.43,00:33:37.43,AND I'M JUST KICKED TO THE CURB AND I'M SECOND FIDDLE.
563,00:33:40.20,00:33:40.20,>> THE GIRLS WILL BE FIGHTING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES.
564,00:33:42.33,00:33:42.33,I PROMISE YOU THEY'LL BE ON BOARD.
565,00:33:44.33,00:33:44.33,"IT WILL BE ONE OF THE COLOSSAL BLIND SIDES ON ""SURVIVOR"""
566,00:33:47.50,00:33:47.50,HISTORY. I'M JUST TELLING YOU.
567,00:33:48.77,00:33:48.77,>> WE'VE BEEN STICKING TO THE FIVE GUYS ALLIANCE AND SUDDENLY
568,00:33:52.00,00:33:52.00,"BRAD IS LIKE, BOOM, WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF JOHN RIGHT NOW."
569,00:33:55.07,00:33:55.07,BIG MOVE. AND I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED.
570,00:33:57.70,00:33:57.70,>> HE'S NOT FINDING THE IDOL TODAY.
571,00:34:00.63,00:34:00.63,>> WHAT'S THE SECOND CLUE? >> YEAH IT'S LIKE SERPENTINE
572,00:34:05.53,00:34:05.53,TREE ON THE WAY TO THE WATERFALL AND YOU HAVE TO DIG FOR IT.
573,00:34:08.77,00:34:08.77,>> IT'S BEEN FIVE GUYS SINCE DAY ONE AND IF WE'RE VOTING ONE OUT
574,00:34:12.10,00:34:12.10,NOW IT COULD BE LIKE OPENING PANDORA'S BOX.
575,00:34:14.07,00:34:14.07,IT COULD REALLY BUILD DISTRUST MOVING FORWARD.
576,00:34:19.57,00:34:19.57,">> THERE HE IS WALKING. HERE'S THE DEAL, WE'RE GOING"
577,00:34:23.80,00:34:23.80,UNIFIED ON JOHN. WE HAVE TO PULL THIS OFF.
578,00:34:25.70,00:34:25.70,BECAUSE HERE'S THE BRUTAL TRUTH: IF IT'S NOT JOHN IT'S GOT TO BE
579,00:34:29.20,00:34:29.20,ONE OF YOU GUYS. ALL RIGHT?
580,00:34:31.83,00:34:31.83,"CALL ME CRAZY, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS."
581,00:34:34.57,00:34:34.57,"AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I MAY VOTE YOU SO THAT IF JOHN GETS BACK IN"
582,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,THE GAME I CAN MAYBE PULL HIM BACK IN.
583,00:34:43.27,00:34:43.27,>> SO BRAD MENTIONS HE WANTS TO BE THE ONE GUY THAT DOESN'T VOTE
584,00:34:46.23,00:34:46.23,FOR JOHN AND I'M NOT DOWN WITH IT.
585,00:34:47.93,00:34:47.93,"IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A MOVE LIKE THIS, WE HAVE TO SUCK IT UP"
586,00:34:50.83,00:34:50.83,AND DO IT AND SAY WE DID IT TOGETHER AND BRAD DOESN'T WANT
587,00:34:53.03,00:34:53.03,TO BE THE BAD GUY. HE ORCHESTRATED IT ALL BUT HE
588,00:34:55.90,00:34:55.90,WANTS US TO DO THE DIRTY WORK WHICH MAKES BRAD A BIG TARGET IN
589,00:34:58.97,00:34:58.97,MY EYES TO SEE THAT LEVEL OF SHIESTINESS.
590,00:35:05.70,00:35:05.70,>> I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE IDOL.
591,00:35:08.93,00:35:08.93,"LIKE, I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL VOTING JOHN BUT I'M SO PARANOID."
592,00:35:21.47,00:35:21.47,>> I THINK IT MIGHT BE SMART. >> MIGHT BE.
593,00:35:23.80,00:35:23.80,">> OH, MY GOD, CAN YOU IMAGINE? OH, MY GOD."
594,00:35:26.47,00:35:26.47,>> I FEEL LIKE EVERY TRIBAL SO FAR I'VE BEEN ON THE CHOPPING
595,00:35:29.50,00:35:29.50,BLOCK SO IF THE BOYS ARE WILLING TO VOTE OUT BRAD I WOULD
596,00:35:32.97,00:35:32.97,DEFINITELY DO THE SAME. I'VE ALWAYS SAID ANYBODY BUT ME.
597,00:35:35.93,00:35:35.93,"I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS. >> YEAH, BUT DO WE WANT TO RISK"
598,00:35:39.63,00:35:39.63,KEEPING SOMEBODY AROUND IF HE ACTUALLY DOES HAVE THE IDOL?
599,00:35:43.47,00:35:43.47,>> THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON.
600,00:35:45.90,00:35:45.90,BRAD THINKS JOHN IS A THREAT. BUT NOW I'M STARTING TO THINK
601,00:35:49.97,00:35:49.97,BRAD'S EQUALLY DANGEROUS. SO TONIGHT IS A HUGE DECISION
602,00:35:53.33,00:35:53.33,FOR US AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
603,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,ONE THING'S FOR SURE: IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG BLIND SIDE.
604,00:36:24.67,00:36:24.67,">> Jeff: JOHN, THIRD TIME IN A ROW."
605,00:36:26.43,00:36:26.43,">> THIRD TIME IN A ROW, JEFF. >> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT"
606,00:36:29.20,00:36:29.20,TODAY'S CHALLENGE. ONCE AGAIN THE MEN WERE THE ONLY
607,00:36:31.30,00:36:31.30,PEOPLE WHO REALLY SCORED ANY POINTS.
608,00:36:33.30,00:36:33.30,WAS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT WHEN YOU WENT BACK
609,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,TO CAMP? >> OF COURSE.
610,00:36:37.00,00:36:37.00,WE KNEW THAT THE BRAWN OF THE MEN IN OUR TEAM WAS ONE OF OUR
611,00:36:39.90,00:36:39.90,"STRONG POINTS BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A CHALLENGE ABOUT"
612,00:36:42.90,00:36:42.90,MATCHUPS. EVERYONE HAS TO BE ABLE TO COME
613,00:36:44.03,00:36:44.03,TO THE CABLE AND WIN THEIR MATCHUP.
614,00:36:46.20,00:36:46.20,">> Jeff: KATIE, FIRST TIME YOU WENT UP AGAINST YOUR MOM YOU"
615,00:36:49.03,00:36:49.03,LOST. TODAY YOU GO UP AGAINST YOUR
616,00:36:50.97,00:36:50.97,"MOM, LOSE AGAIN. >> YEAH."
617,00:36:52.37,00:36:52.37,AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY TWO FEMALES SO WE
618,00:36:54.93,00:36:54.93,"HAVE TO GO IN SEVERAL TIMES AND IT WAS FRUSTRATING, DEFINITELY."
619,00:36:58.97,00:36:58.97,">> Jeff: CIERA, HOW ABOUT FOR YOU?"
620,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,>> YEAH. THAT WAS ROUGH.
621,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,"I MEAN, IF I COULD JUST WIN ONE AND KATIE COULD JUST WIN ONE WE"
622,00:37:07.20,00:37:07.20,"DEFINITELY HAD A CHANCE AT WINNING THE THING SO, YEAH,"
623,00:37:09.97,00:37:09.97,YOU'RE EMBARRASSED BECAUSE YOU LOST TO YOUR MOM AND NOT ONLY
624,00:37:12.43,00:37:12.43,THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU LET YOUR TEAM DOWN.
625,00:37:16.40,00:37:16.40,">> Jeff: CALEB, THREE VOTES, THREE WOMEN GONE FROM THIS"
626,00:37:19.20,00:37:19.20,TRIBE. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THIS
627,00:37:21.33,00:37:21.33,TRIBE? >> MALES PRETTY MUCH DOMINATE
628,00:37:23.03,00:37:23.03,IT. IF WE LOSE AND COME HERE IT'S
629,00:37:24.93,00:37:24.93,USUALLY GOING TO BE A GIRL GOING HOME.
630,00:37:26.90,00:37:26.90,">> Jeff: VYTAS, IS IT A MALE ALLIANCE OR THE FACT THAT WE"
631,00:37:31.37,00:37:31.37,THINK WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF THE THREE WEAKEST PEOPLE AND THAT'S
632,00:37:33.83,00:37:33.83,WHY THERE HAVE BEEN WOMEN SO FAR?
633,00:37:35.40,00:37:35.40,>> I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE AS RUDIMENTARY AS MEN VERSUS WOMEN.
634,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,"I THINK TRUST IS THE CURRENCY OF THIS GAME, JEFF."
635,00:37:40.77,00:37:40.77,TRUST AND INFORMATION. ANYTHING SOMEBODY SAYS OR DOES
636,00:37:44.20,00:37:44.20,JUST ADDS TO THE INFORMATION YOU GET ABOUT THAT PERSON.
637,00:37:47.10,00:37:47.10,">> Jeff: CULPEPPER, VIE SRAO ++EU IT IS A BASICALLY SAID"
638,00:37:52.83,00:37:52.83,WHEN YOU SAY ANYTHING THAT COULD BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THIS
639,00:37:55.60,00:37:55.60,GAME. DOES THAT CONCERN YOU A BIT?
640,00:37:56.97,00:37:56.97,>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. AT THE END OF THE DAY I GUESS
641,00:37:59.83,00:37:59.83,I'M SENSITIVE BECAUSE EVERY TIME GO TO REDEMPTION ISLAND I'M TO
642,00:38:02.93,00:38:02.93,BLAME FOR WHOMEVER IS THERE AND FOR WHATEVER REASON PEOPLE SEEM
643,00:38:06.00,00:38:06.00,TO THINK I WAS THE KINGPIN OF THIS GROUP WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE
644,00:38:08.60,00:38:08.60,I AM BUT THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY
645,00:38:13.30,00:38:13.30,"DIFFICULT. >> Jeff: JOHN, BRAD BRINGS UP"
646,00:38:15.20,00:38:15.20,"REDEMPTION ISLAND. ONCE AGAIN, CANDICE, YOUR WIFE,"
647,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,GAVE YOU ANOTHER CLUE TO THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND SHE

650,00:38:25.67,00:38:25.67,YOU THINK? >> CANDICE IS A STUDENT OF THE
651,00:38:28.07,00:38:28.07,GAME. SHE KNOWS THAT GIVING ME THE
652,00:38:29.33,00:38:29.33,CLUES SO PUBLICLY PUTS A BIG TARGET ON MY BACK WHETHER I HAVE
653,00:38:32.53,00:38:32.53,THE IDOL OR NOT. SO I THINK SHE'S TRUSTING THAT
654,00:38:35.03,00:38:35.03,I'VE PUT MYSELF IN A GOOD POSITION IN THE GAME AND THEN
655,00:38:37.27,00:38:37.27,KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT IF THE TIME COMES.
656,00:38:40.77,00:38:40.77,">> Jeff: VYTAS, DO YOU WISH IT WAS YOU THAT HAD THE CLUES TO"
657,00:38:44.20,00:38:44.20,THE IDOL OR ARE YOU GLAD IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE?
658,00:38:46.07,00:38:46.07,">> I THINK IT'S TOUGH, JEFF. IT CAN DEFINITELY HELP YOUR"
659,00:38:49.07,00:38:49.07,ALLIANCE AND HELP US GO FURTHER BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS
660,00:38:51.70,00:38:51.70,"GAME KNOWS THAT JOHN HAS THOSE TWO CLUES, YOU KNOW?"
661,00:38:54.77,00:38:54.77,SO AT THIS POINT I'M HAPPY SOMEBODY IN MY ALLIANCE HAS IT
662,00:38:58.13,00:38:58.13,"BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY IT'S NOT ME. >> Jeff: HAYDEN, WHAT ARE THE"
663,00:39:02.93,00:39:02.93,CHANCES THAT WITH TWO CLUES HE DOESN'T HAVE IT?
664,00:39:05.13,00:39:05.13,">> (LAUGHS) IT DEPENDS ON THE CLUES, JEFF."
665,00:39:07.60,00:39:07.60,I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CLUES MYSELF SO I DON'T KNOW HOW PRECISE THEY
666,00:39:10.63,00:39:10.63,ARE. >> Jeff: SO HE HASN'T SHARED
667,00:39:12.20,00:39:12.20,THEM WITH YOU? >> HE HAS NOT SHARED THEM WITH
668,00:39:14.50,00:39:14.50,ME. NO.
669,00:39:14.93,00:39:14.93,>> Jeff: DOES THAT MAKE YOU QUESTION A LITTLE?
670,00:39:16.70,00:39:16.70,">> A LITTLE BIT IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND, OF COURSE."
671,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S -- I'VE GOT TO TAKE HIS WORD.
672,00:39:23.43,00:39:23.43,">> ANOTHER THING THAT'S TOUGH, JEFF, IS THAT WE CAN'T ALL TELL"
673,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO FIGURE
674,00:39:28.63,00:39:28.63,OUT HOW TO MOVE AHEAD TO BETTER OURSELVES.
675,00:39:31.30,00:39:31.30,"I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY GOING TO BE ONE WINNER AT THE END OF THE"
676,00:39:34.13,00:39:34.13,DAY. >> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.

681,00:40:43.10,00:40:43.10,THE DECISION IS FINAL. PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
682,00:40:45.13,00:40:45.13,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
683,00:40:47.53,00:40:47.53,I'LL READ THE VOTES. FIRST VOTE: CIERA.
