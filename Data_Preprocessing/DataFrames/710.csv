5,00:00:10.07,00:00:10.07,"stabbing someone in the back. This time, I feel like"
6,00:00:13.53,00:00:13.53,I stood up for myself. >> PROBST: At the reward
7,00:00:15.77,00:00:15.77,challenge... Fire.
8,00:00:17.17,00:00:17.17,...Rupert had the sharpest aim. There it is!
9,00:00:20.03,00:00:20.03,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Rupert wins reward!
10,00:00:22.00,00:00:22.00,But decided to give the reward away.
11,00:00:24.17,00:00:24.17,>> Burton gave me the immunity last night.
12,00:00:26.57,00:00:26.57,"I'll give him the breakfast. >> PROBST: Burton, you're"
13,00:00:28.97,00:00:28.97,going to breakfast and you're taking
14,00:00:30.83,00:00:30.83,somebody with you. Burton chose Lill to join him
15,00:00:34.30,00:00:34.30,"for a breakfast feast. >> Oh, my Lord."
16,00:00:36.93,00:00:36.93,>> PROBST: They indulged. >> To the outcasts.
17,00:00:39.83,00:00:39.83,>> To the outcasts. >> PROBST: And Burton hatched a
18,00:00:41.97,00:00:41.97,plan to get rid of Rupert. >> We've got to get
19,00:00:44.13,00:00:44.13,"Rupert off right now. Okay, so you need to"
20,00:00:46.10,00:00:46.10,"make friends with Christa and say, ""Listen, I'm going along"
21,00:00:48.27,00:00:48.27,"with whatever you guys want."" >> Well, see, now, it's starting"
22,00:00:51.43,00:00:51.43,to lie and I'm going to have a problem with that.
23,00:00:53.87,00:00:53.87,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, Rupert guaranteed"
24,00:00:56.00,00:00:56.00,himself three more days by defeating all the others.
25,00:01:00.70,00:01:00.70,"And with that, Rupert has immunity."
26,00:01:03.37,00:01:03.37,"( laughing ) Back at camp,"
27,00:01:06.97,00:01:06.97,Ryno was feeling vulnerable and tried some last minute
28,00:01:09.50,00:01:09.50,"strategizing. I could get the two girls,"
29,00:01:12.97,00:01:12.97,"and if you could get Lill, you know, we kind of"
30,00:01:15.77,00:01:15.77,control our own destiny. >> PROBST: But at Tribal
31,00:01:18.10,00:01:18.10,Council... Ryan.
32,00:01:20.97,00:01:20.97,"Ryno was voted out. >> I'll be back, guys."
33,00:01:25.13,00:01:25.13,>> PROBST: He became the first member of the jury.

38,00:02:58.43,00:02:58.43,>> Nighttime is my one bad time. If I could go just 39 days
39,00:03:05.10,00:03:05.10,"and never have to sleep, I would make this beautifully."
40,00:03:09.83,00:03:09.83,But nighttime is killing me. ( quietly ): Just got to make it
41,00:03:16.43,00:03:16.43,through another day. And another and another
42,00:03:18.60,00:03:18.60,"and another and another... At night out here,"
43,00:03:23.37,00:03:23.37,I start thinking about family. That's when I miss my family.
44,00:03:26.63,00:03:26.63,"( thunder crashing ) I tell Laura, my wife,"
45,00:03:32.03,00:03:32.03,"all my woes and sorrows, all my triumphs."
46,00:03:36.67,00:03:36.67,I tell Laura everything. And I want for everyone to see
47,00:03:44.00,00:03:44.00,I am the best damn survivor that has ever been.
48,00:03:48.50,00:03:48.50,I am it. I know they will.
49,00:03:53.47,00:03:53.47,"Shouldn't think that way, I know."
50,00:03:55.77,00:03:55.77,I know. I know. I know.
51,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67,I hear you. I hear you.
52,00:04:01.07,00:04:01.07,Take it down to the one or two people
53,00:04:03.47,00:04:03.47,"that I truly, really care about."
54,00:04:05.57,00:04:05.57,I care about Sandra and Christa.
55,00:04:07.70,00:04:07.70,They care about me. It's very hard keeping
56,00:04:12.20,00:04:12.20,mentally aware of everything that's going on around here.
57,00:04:15.13,00:04:15.13,I try to guide everything that goes on on my island.
58,00:04:21.37,00:04:21.37,I try to direct everyone's actions
59,00:04:24.73,00:04:24.73,while keeping myself grounded and aware of what is going on
60,00:04:28.57,00:04:28.57,"and what I am doing, not settling ever"
61,00:04:31.13,00:04:31.13,for anything but first. And letting everybody here
62,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,realize that they are finishing in places of honor.
63,00:04:41.83,00:04:41.83,To build them up to be a winner and still lose...
64,00:04:48.83,00:04:48.83,that's a hard mental battle. >> Beebee.
65,00:05:08.67,00:05:08.67,">> Thank you, baby. ( chuckling )"
66,00:05:11.07,00:05:11.07,>> I know. ( kisses )
67,00:05:16.30,00:05:16.30,"Blah, blah. >> Honestly, Rupert and Christa"
68,00:05:18.90,00:05:18.90,"are making me sick with their, ""Baby, baby, beebee, beebee,"""
69,00:05:22.83,00:05:22.83,"blah, blah, blah. ( Rupert laughing )"
70,00:05:25.73,00:05:25.73,>> I know. >> I've been saying this
71,00:05:28.23,00:05:28.23,in my head and I... I've never... I haven't vocally
72,00:05:30.80,00:05:30.80,"expressed this thought, but I feel, uh, Rupert,"
73,00:05:33.27,00:05:33.27,Christa and Sandra have gotten to the point of...
74,00:05:35.53,00:05:35.53,"of the old saying, ""Absolute power"
75,00:05:37.53,00:05:37.53,"corrupts absolutely."" They are so power-ridden,"
76,00:05:40.97,00:05:40.97,"they know it, that they feel that they're above the law."
77,00:05:43.53,00:05:43.53,">> Jon and I will be back in about 15, 20 minutes."
78,00:05:48.03,00:05:48.03,>> That's very good. >> Burton and I decided to go
79,00:05:50.63,00:05:50.63,"on a... well, we decided to talk a little strategy,"
80,00:05:54.10,00:05:54.10,"knowing that the bond between Christa, Rupert and Sandra"
81,00:05:58.67,00:05:58.67,pretty much puts us at fourth and fifth.
82,00:06:01.07,00:06:01.07,"Like, to hand-feed me number four and say, ""Jon,"
83,00:06:03.23,00:06:03.23,"be happy. It's number four."" No. That's not going"
84,00:06:06.30,00:06:06.30,to make me happy. >> We need to be starting
85,00:06:08.83,00:06:08.83,"to chat up with D and T. Just be like, ""Hey, listen."
86,00:06:14.73,00:06:14.73,"You guys know you're going. ""If we can knock Rupert off,"
87,00:06:18.23,00:06:18.23,"we can break this triad deal."" If we can take him"
88,00:06:22.73,00:06:22.73,"out now, we need to. >> Mm-hmm."
89,00:06:24.83,00:06:24.83,">> But, we need to... We just need to start"
90,00:06:27.20,00:06:27.20,getting a foundation with D and T.
91,00:06:30.27,00:06:30.27,">> Once again, Jonny Fairplay finds himself"
92,00:06:32.43,00:06:32.43,in a great position. He can either go with Plan A:
93,00:06:36.40,00:06:36.40,"Christa, Rupert, Sandra, and Burton, or Plan B:"
94,00:06:39.13,00:06:39.13,"Burton, D, T, and Lill. And, uh, I'm throwing"
95,00:06:44.03,00:06:44.03,"all my eggs in choice ""B."" You know, if the bases are"
96,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,"loaded and, you know, you got three people saying, ""Hey,"
97,00:06:50.33,00:06:50.33,"bunt""... Screw you, man. This is my chance"
98,00:06:52.50,00:06:52.50,to knock a grand slam. >> Rupert would be scrambling.
99,00:06:55.17,00:06:55.17,"The thing is he will be livid, like, beyond belief."
100,00:06:58.83,00:06:58.83,>> I know. >> The problem is it's more
101,00:07:02.20,00:07:02.20,"risky to flip the alliance now and to go against Rupert,"
102,00:07:05.73,00:07:05.73,"Chris and Sandra. If I go this other way,"
103,00:07:08.20,00:07:08.20,"I have a much better chance, but if I get caught"
104,00:07:11.00,00:07:11.00,"and the cover is blown, it's not going to be"
105,00:07:13.77,00:07:13.77,a good thing. That's why we've got to start
106,00:07:16.17,00:07:16.17,"talking to those girls, 'cause right now,"
107,00:07:17.77,00:07:17.77,"we're about to get screwed, too. I talked to Lill about this"
108,00:07:20.37,00:07:20.37,"and I've talked to Jon about it. So, we didn't know when to tell"
109,00:07:24.93,00:07:24.93,Tijuana and Darrah what the plan is to flip
110,00:07:26.97,00:07:26.97,on our original alliance. >> It's empty.
111,00:07:42.40,00:07:42.40,>> Good boy. >> I think I need to go fishing.
112,00:07:55.50,00:07:55.50,">> Good luck, Rupe. >> All right, let's get"
113,00:07:58.67,00:07:58.67,that big-ass shark today. Big-ass shark steaks.
114,00:08:03.67,00:08:03.67,I have to go out and get fish. I would love it if I was
115,00:08:07.87,00:08:07.87,a mean-ass son of a bitch and just went out
116,00:08:10.40,00:08:10.40,"and got fish for myself. But, so, what do you do?"
117,00:08:14.17,00:08:14.17,You go out and get fish. >> Days can't pass by fast
118,00:08:19.77,00:08:19.77,"enough, you know? >> They're gone."
119,00:08:26.33,00:08:26.33,>> Burton and I found ourselves with an opportunity--
120,00:08:29.17,00:08:29.17,everyone else there with Rupert fishing
121,00:08:31.17,00:08:31.17,and Sandra and Christa going to get lemons.
122,00:08:33.47,00:08:33.47,"I looked at Burton, Burton looked at me."
123,00:08:35.37,00:08:35.37,"He was like, ""You think now's the time?"""
124,00:08:37.50,00:08:37.50,"I was like, ""Absolutely."" >> A shark appears,"
125,00:08:52.40,00:08:52.40,"and I'm like, ""Ah, I want him. I want him, bad."""
126,00:08:56.83,00:08:56.83,"But, the only way I'm taking that shot"
127,00:08:59.27,00:08:59.27,"is if I can get directly over him,"
128,00:09:01.90,00:09:01.90,hit him straight down in the head
129,00:09:04.10,00:09:04.10,"and hold that spear into him. Because, if not, he's going"
130,00:09:07.33,00:09:07.33,"to be gone with my spear. >> The alliance between Rupert,"
131,00:09:19.33,00:09:19.33,Sandra and Christa... the two of us...
132,00:09:21.07,00:09:21.07,>> It's unbreakable. >> The two of us are
133,00:09:22.90,00:09:22.90,on the outside. >> Right.
134,00:09:24.73,00:09:24.73,">> Because, Rupert's threatened threatened by me, they all--"
135,00:09:27.00,00:09:27.00,every single one has told me they want him out
136,00:09:29.37,00:09:29.37,"the second there's a chance. Bottom line is, if those"
137,00:09:31.53,00:09:31.53,"three are in at the end, no one else will be."
138,00:09:33.83,00:09:33.83,"Because, Rupert will win every immunity."
139,00:09:36.53,00:09:36.53,">> And, you know what, I'd rather have one, two..."
140,00:09:38.83,00:09:38.83,"well, four, five, four, three, whatever."
141,00:09:40.87,00:09:40.87,">> Me, too. >> I would love to have this..."
142,00:09:43.17,00:09:43.17,versus that. >> Here's the key.
143,00:09:45.73,00:09:45.73,"Here's the key. Number one, Rupert goes first."
144,00:09:47.87,00:09:47.87,"If he doesn't win immunity, we go after Christa."
145,00:09:50.03,00:09:50.03,"No one can breathe a word, if we're all..."
146,00:09:52.17,00:09:52.17,Oh... Here it is. Here it is.
147,00:09:54.40,00:09:54.40,>> I have an important... I have one important...
148,00:09:56.27,00:09:56.27,"When they come to us and say, ""Okay, Darrah's next."""
149,00:09:58.53,00:09:58.53,">> If they think that I'm going to be the next one to go,"
150,00:10:00.83,00:10:00.83,"I'll just play it off like, ""Yeah, I know I am."""
151,00:10:02.83,00:10:02.83,">> ""There's nothing I can do about it."""
152,00:10:04.57,00:10:04.57,">> Yeah. Okay. >> Okay, just remember,"
153,00:10:06.43,00:10:06.43,we have-- the five of us-- have to stick together until
154,00:10:08.60,00:10:08.60,"all three of those are gone. >> Look, we know it, that's it."
155,00:10:10.97,00:10:10.97,"There's no more talking about it, 'cause someone"
156,00:10:12.83,00:10:12.83,could overhear. ( Jon speaks indistinctly )
157,00:10:14.90,00:10:14.90,">> Yeah, you're going to be here..."
158,00:10:16.93,00:10:16.93,>> You're going to be here for...
159,00:10:18.87,00:10:18.87,"Gimme, gimme, gimmegimme. >> We tell them,"
160,00:10:21.03,00:10:21.03,Rupert's going home. Their eyes 
161,00:10:23.67,00:10:23.67,are about as big as the sun. They can't believe it.
162,00:10:27.50,00:10:27.50,"They're like, ""Oh, my God! Thank you guys so much!"
163,00:10:29.57,00:10:29.57,"Thank you so much!"" So, the game's about to take"
164,00:10:32.13,00:10:32.13,"a serious, serious change. >> All right, let's get"
165,00:10:34.20,00:10:34.20,"some... do some work. >> I was down in the dumps,"
166,00:10:36.60,00:10:36.60,"thinking that I was going to go home, but all of"
167,00:10:39.07,00:10:39.07,"a sudden, that changed. And now, I'm just..."
168,00:10:41.27,00:10:41.27,I'm ready to stay. >> I almost had a four-foot
169,00:10:47.53,00:10:47.53,"gray reef shark. My God, I sure did want"
170,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,that shark. I love being the baddest hunter
171,00:10:54.77,00:10:54.77,"out there. I never give up,"
172,00:10:57.50,00:10:57.50,"I never surrender, I never admit defeat."
173,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,>> We got sea mail. >> We got sea mail?
174,00:11:13.10,00:11:13.10,>> Yup. >> Read that puppy.
175,00:11:15.17,00:11:15.17,"Let me see that boat. ""Morgan, Drake and Balboa,"
176,00:11:20.60,00:11:20.60,"""in their shadows you'll compete,"

178,00:11:26.90,00:11:26.90,"""From poop deck to crow's nest, just"
179,00:11:28.97,00:11:28.97,"as fast as you please, ""be the best swabbie you can be"
180,00:11:32.07,00:11:32.07,"for the adventures on the sea."" >> So, we're going to probably"
181,00:11:34.60,00:11:34.60,be climbing something from bottom to top.
182,00:11:36.67,00:11:36.67,">> Yeah. >> We got tree mail,"
183,00:11:39.20,00:11:39.20,"and the clue says, you're going to be following in"
184,00:11:41.97,00:11:41.97,the shadows of ancient pirates. I think I've got a pretty good
185,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,shot at it if it's something that has to do with speed.
186,00:11:47.77,00:11:47.77,"If I do win, just to keep the impression that our alliance"
187,00:11:50.97,00:11:50.97,"was going strong, I'll be giving my reward"
188,00:11:53.40,00:11:53.40,"to Rupert, because he gave me his last time."
189,00:11:57.07,00:11:57.07,"Well, you got one coming back your direction."
190,00:11:58.83,00:11:58.83,( laughing ) Soon as I can beat you.

194,00:12:11.60,00:12:11.60,and he would pay me back with the next challenge he wins.
195,00:12:15.27,00:12:15.27,Burton promised me. It's fine.
196,00:12:17.57,00:12:17.57,It keeps unity between he and I. It's a deal.
197,00:12:20.27,00:12:20.27,"It keeps unity in our group. >> PROBST: Come on, guys."
198,00:12:31.47,00:12:31.47,"Let's get to it. For today's reward challenge,"

309,00:18:17.83,00:18:17.83,making good progress. You both have the skull
310,00:18:21.03,00:18:21.03,and crossbones. You're trying to figure out
311,00:18:22.57,00:18:22.57,"how to frame it. No need to force it, guys."

332,00:19:33.33,00:19:33.33,"was not as fun as I had hoped. That was painful,"

339,00:19:56.03,00:19:56.03,We had so much rot and death here.
340,00:20:01.57,00:20:01.57,"When Burton gave that away to Jon, and Lill kept it in her"
341,00:20:05.47,00:20:05.47,"hand without even thinking about it, that showed me that..."
342,00:20:10.33,00:20:10.33,I might not be as secure as I am... as I think I am.

361,00:21:16.63,00:21:16.63,"Yeah, but I'm such a bitch. >> No, no. Thank God."
362,00:21:19.33,00:21:19.33,>> Don't say that about God. ( sobbing

367,00:21:34.77,00:21:34.77,We're going to. That's not a problem.
368,00:21:36.57,00:21:36.57,We're bringing plenty of fish. They're gonna be happy.

372,00:21:48.73,00:21:48.73,at the game. I don't go on
373,00:21:51.47,00:21:51.47,vacations all the time. I can't afford
374,00:21:53.43,00:21:53.43,to do these kind of things. If I had a chance
375,00:21:56.17,00:21:56.17,"to sail on a beautiful boat, that's what was in my mind."
376,00:21:59.97,00:21:59.97,I've never done anything like that before.

380,00:22:14.70,00:22:14.70,>> Because there's no point. There's no way either one of us
381,00:22:17.27,00:22:17.27,can beat anyone else as soon as we go through
382,00:22:19.70,00:22:19.70,with what we do tomorrow. There's no way.
383,00:22:21.93,00:22:21.93,I know that. You know that. That's it.
384,00:22:24.10,00:22:24.10,">> But, like... I'll admit, I am putting"
385,00:22:25.80,00:22:25.80,100% of my faith in you. You and I just have
386,00:22:28.67,00:22:28.67,to control everything from here on out.
387,00:22:30.43,00:22:30.43,"And as long as the two of us can get Lill to vote with us,"
388,00:22:32.93,00:22:32.93,"there's three people. >> Oh, we're fine."
389,00:22:34.53,00:22:34.53,">> And we're fine. Yes, all right."
390,00:22:45.40,00:22:45.40,>> I heard Burton and Jon talking in the bushes.
391,00:22:47.60,00:22:47.60,Jon is going to work his magic on Lill
392,00:22:50.73,00:22:50.73,"the whole boat ride. >> If they turn, we're all dead."
393,00:22:55.50,00:22:55.50,"If they... >> It's not turning,"
394,00:22:57.53,00:22:57.53,it's just that they want her in the palm of their hand.
395,00:23:00.27,00:23:00.27,What kind of game is he going to play on her on the boat?
396,00:23:03.40,00:23:03.40,">> It doesn't matter. Lill will come back,"
397,00:23:07.00,00:23:07.00,and I will talk to Lill. I talk to Lill
398,00:23:09.33,00:23:09.33,every morning for hours. >> You going to ask her
399,00:23:12.40,00:23:12.40,what they talked about? >> Yep.
400,00:23:14.00,00:23:14.00,I'm going to ask her exactly what they talked about.
401,00:23:16.13,00:23:16.13,And she will tell me. >> Lill?
402,00:23:20.43,00:23:20.43,Time to go. >> Got to find out what's going
403,00:23:25.63,00:23:25.63,on. My only hope is
404,00:23:27.70,00:23:27.70,"when Lill comes back, she looks me in the eye"
405,00:23:32.13,00:23:32.13,and tells me what Jon is talking about.
406,00:23:42.33,00:23:42.33,">> Oh, yes. >> Oh, my goodness."
407,00:23:47.63,00:23:47.63,>> Cheers. >> Cheers.
408,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,>> To the final three. >> To the final three.
409,00:23:53.10,00:23:53.10,>> I have never ever been on anything
410,00:23:55.30,00:23:55.30,anywhere near this boat. Who's the captain?
411,00:23:59.17,00:23:59.17,">> Hola, se\xc3\xb1or. El capit\xc3\xa1n."
412,00:24:01.73,00:24:01.73,"Oh, you're glad you didn't give this bad boy"
413,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17,"up now, aren't you? >> I don't know,"
414,00:24:05.87,00:24:05.87,the ramifications... >> There are no ramifications.
415,00:24:08.03,00:24:08.03,I have everything worked out and we have all day
416,00:24:10.33,00:24:10.33,"to discuss it, so you will have no more"
417,00:24:12.70,00:24:12.70,questions and there'll be no more talk at camp
418,00:24:14.67,00:24:14.67,"between anybody. So, the only thing"
419,00:24:16.47,00:24:16.47,that can hurt us... >> You just need to let me know
420,00:24:18.73,00:24:18.73,what's going on. >> I'm going to tell you
421,00:24:20.67,00:24:20.67,"everything today, and when we leave here, you will have"
422,00:24:22.70,00:24:22.70,no more questions. >> All right.
423,00:24:24.57,00:24:24.57,You may have to tell me a couple times.
424,00:24:26.73,00:24:26.73,>> Okay. Here's the deal. First: Rupert.
425,00:24:28.93,00:24:28.93,"If Rupert's not available, then Christa."
426,00:24:30.87,00:24:30.87,">> Yeah, but I have a lot of guilt."
427,00:24:33.87,00:24:33.87,"You don't, I do. >> Please, you... you have to"
428,00:24:35.83,00:24:35.83,"check that guilt at the door, or else quit this game right now."
429,00:24:38.50,00:24:38.50,Cheers. Are you happy? >> I'm happy.
430,00:24:40.17,00:24:40.17,">> You should be, you're final three."
431,00:24:54.80,00:24:54.80,">> I smell Cerveza. >> Oh, my gosh."
432,00:24:57.20,00:24:57.20,">> Yes, sir! Thank you very much, sir."
433,00:25:02.10,00:25:02.10,"You drink beer, Lill? >> Not a whole lot."
434,00:25:04.60,00:25:04.60,">> Well, I'll be happy to finish that for you."
435,00:25:06.63,00:25:06.63,"I think you know that. Oh, you're the man!"
436,00:25:09.87,00:25:09.87,">> Oh, my gosh! Oh! >> We got veggies over there,"
437,00:25:12.87,00:25:12.87,and we got a whole meat over here.
438,00:25:15.47,00:25:15.47,>> Simple-made things make me very excitable.
439,00:25:18.17,00:25:18.17,( laughs ) >> I need to date women like
440,00:25:21.47,00:25:21.47,you. >> Hey.
441,00:25:23.73,00:25:23.73,>> Mmm... >> Mmm...
442,00:25:26.17,00:25:26.17,>> This is the best part of this entire game.
443,00:25:28.60,00:25:28.60,Right here. >> You know how much I like
444,00:25:40.23,00:25:40.23,myself? Seeing how good I look right now
445,00:25:43.23,00:25:43.23,is a great thing. Oh. Man.
446,00:25:48.53,00:25:48.53,>> Square knot. I am the Scout Master.
447,00:25:52.07,00:25:52.07,"Woo-hoo! >> You're drunk, Lill."
448,00:25:54.33,00:25:54.33,>> I've had three-quarters of a beer.
449,00:25:56.73,00:25:56.73,>> I think you're drunk. >> What happens if I get one?
450,00:26:13.90,00:26:13.90,">> Uh, reel it in. >> I would really like"
451,00:26:16.37,00:26:16.37,to bring some home. >> Yeah.
452,00:26:27.27,00:26:27.27,>> Whoo-hoo. >> Any fish?
453,00:26:30.23,00:26:30.23,>> Yeah. We fished the entire time.
454,00:26:35.73,00:26:35.73,">> See, they kind of fished for us, and they threw out"
455,00:26:39.13,00:26:39.13,the fishing hooks in the back and... nothing.
456,00:26:41.40,00:26:41.40,">> Yeah, you just trolled around."
457,00:26:43.23,00:26:43.23,"When Jon and Lill came back from their catamaran,"
458,00:26:46.93,00:26:46.93,"I just sucked Lill in quickly and told her, ""You stick with me"
459,00:26:50.20,00:26:50.20,"and you could be top two."" You know, ""It could be you"
460,00:26:53.07,00:26:53.07,"and me."" How many other times have you"
461,00:26:55.77,00:26:55.77,been on the winning team? I tried to figure out
462,00:26:58.93,00:26:58.93,what Jon was talking to her about
463,00:27:00.87,00:27:00.87,and if Jon was going to try and suck her in and get her in
464,00:27:03.93,00:27:03.93,"some kind of alliance. >> No, no."
465,00:27:06.80,00:27:06.80,">> And she said ""no."" I know now that Lill"
466,00:27:09.73,00:27:09.73,will be wholehearted with me. I wanted to hug and kiss her.
467,00:27:30.90,00:27:30.90,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Okay."
468,00:27:38.60,00:27:38.60,"Rupert, for the second time, I take this away from you."
469,00:27:43.23,00:27:43.23,"Once again, Immunity back up for grabs."
470,00:27:47.23,00:27:47.23,"Okay, let's get to today's challenge."
471,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,"It is based on an old dart game called ""Killer."""
472,00:27:52.50,00:27:52.50,"Your first goal: become a Killer, and you do that"
473,00:27:55.13,00:27:55.13,by hitting your own color on the target.
474,00:27:57.07,00:27:57.07,"Once you're a Killer, you can start attacking"
475,00:27:59.43,00:27:59.43,other tribe members. Each time a Killer hits
476,00:28:02.27,00:28:02.27,"another tribe member's color, they lose one, two"
477,00:28:05.33,00:28:05.33,"or three of their lives, depending if they're hit"
478,00:28:08.87,00:28:08.87,"in the single, the double or the triple"
479,00:28:10.90,00:28:10.90,"section of the target. Once your lives are gone,"
480,00:28:13.47,00:28:13.47,you're out of the game. Last person left on the board...
481,00:28:16.20,00:28:16.20,"wins Immunity. To make it a little more fun,"
482,00:28:19.57,00:28:19.57,you won't be throwing darts... you'll be using a blowgun.
483,00:28:23.70,00:28:23.70,We'll draw numbers to pick your spot.
484,00:28:26.23,00:28:26.23,We'll get started. First up: Lill.
485,00:28:34.63,00:28:34.63,Get a lung full of air and make yourself a Killer.
486,00:28:37.50,00:28:37.50,"So, your goal is to hit your own color,"
487,00:28:39.57,00:28:39.57,activate your Killer status. Not enough;
488,00:28:43.67,00:28:43.67,going to need a little more air. Next up: T.
489,00:28:46.37,00:28:46.37,"Give it a good blow. >> Oh, that sucked."
490,00:28:50.63,00:28:50.63,>> PROBST: Darrah trying to hit her color.
491,00:28:53.20,00:28:53.20,Nope. Jon.
492,00:28:58.13,00:28:58.13,Rupert! Step up and show them
493,00:29:00.77,00:29:00.77,how it's done. It's as easy as that--
494,00:29:04.17,00:29:04.17,Rupert is on the board as our first Killer.
495,00:29:06.43,00:29:06.43,>> Thank you. >> PROBST: Burton looking
496,00:29:08.70,00:29:08.70,to hit brown. Look at that!
497,00:29:11.83,00:29:11.83,">> Good job, Burton. >> PROBST: Burton follows right"
498,00:29:13.67,00:29:13.67,behind. Burton now a Killer.
499,00:29:16.60,00:29:16.60,"Sandra. You hit Sandra,"
500,00:29:20.20,00:29:20.20,but you're not a Killer. Doesn't count.
501,00:29:26.23,00:29:26.23,There it is! Jon's on the board.
502,00:29:28.77,00:29:28.77,Jon is a Killer. Rupert.
503,00:29:31.97,00:29:31.97,Darrah takes two hits. You lose one life
504,00:29:34.57,00:29:34.57,and you lose a second life; Darrah down to her Safety.
505,00:29:39.87,00:29:39.87,Burton gives T a hit. >> Ooh!
506,00:29:43.77,00:29:43.77,>> Thank God. Sandra hits herself with
507,00:29:45.63,00:29:45.63,"a double and becomes a Killer. Good shot, but you're not a"
508,00:29:49.33,00:29:49.33,Killer-- doesn't count. Jon hits Christa with a triple.
509,00:30:01.07,00:30:01.07,"Christa, one life... two life... three life."
510,00:30:05.73,00:30:05.73,>> My bad. >> PROBST: Christa's out of the
511,00:30:07.87,00:30:07.87,"game, have a seat on the bench. >> Sorry."
512,00:30:10.33,00:30:10.33,>> That was quick. >> PROBST: Darrah takes two
513,00:30:14.03,00:30:14.03,"hits, you lose your last life, Darrah, have a seat next to"
514,00:30:18.20,00:30:18.20,"Christa, you're out of the game. Burton has Killer status."
515,00:30:22.03,00:30:22.03,Looking to put some pain on somebody.
516,00:30:23.93,00:30:23.93,And he does with a triple on Rupert.
517,00:30:27.30,00:30:27.30,Rupert loses Killer status... one life...
518,00:30:32.17,00:30:32.17,"and a second life. And with one hit,"
519,00:30:34.43,00:30:34.43,Rupert is down to one last life. ( mouths word )
520,00:30:41.93,00:30:41.93,>> PROBST: Rupert takes his last hit.
521,00:30:46.37,00:30:46.37,"Rupert, out of the game. T. takes a double hit."
522,00:31:01.57,00:31:01.57,"T., you lose this life and you lose your last life,"
523,00:31:05.13,00:31:05.13,your Safety. T.is out of the game.
524,00:31:07.67,00:31:07.67,Have a seat on the bench. >> He kills me again.
525,00:31:10.57,00:31:10.57,>> Oh... >> Son of a...
526,00:31:17.13,00:31:17.13,>> PROBST: Burton hits a triple on Sandra.
527,00:31:19.57,00:31:19.57,"Sandra, now down to your last life."

529,00:31:25.83,00:31:25.83,>> PROBST: But you're not a Killer.
530,00:31:31.37,00:31:31.37,"Burton hits Sandra and, just like that,"
531,00:31:33.43,00:31:33.43,Sandra loses her last life. Take a seat on the bench.
532,00:31:37.10,00:31:37.10,"We're down to three: Jon, Lill, Burton."
533,00:31:47.00,00:31:47.00,"Burton gives a triple shot to Jon and, like that,"
534,00:31:49.77,00:31:49.77,Jon loses one life... two life...
535,00:31:53.93,00:31:53.93,"and the third life. Jon, have a seat,"
536,00:31:55.93,00:31:55.93,you're out of the game. >> It was a pleasure having me.
537,00:31:58.47,00:31:58.47,"( chuckles ) >> PROBST: Once again,"
538,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,we're down to a familiar pair: Lill and Burton.
539,00:32:06.20,00:32:06.20,Burton. All you have to do is
540,00:32:08.90,00:32:08.90,"hit light blue anywhere, Lill's out of the game,"
541,00:32:11.43,00:32:11.43,you're going home with Immunity. Takes his aim.
542,00:32:17.70,00:32:17.70,"Lillian, out of the game. >> Oh, my heart."
543,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,>> PROBST: Burton wins Immunity-- again.
544,00:32:25.53,00:32:25.53,"Burton, come on over. You've had this"
545,00:32:27.83,00:32:27.83,around you before. >> I have.
546,00:32:29.63,00:32:29.63,>> PROBST: Turn around and put it on.
547,00:32:32.83,00:32:32.83,Safe from tonight's vote. Three more days out here.
548,00:32:35.07,00:32:35.07,"Valuable Immunity. As you know,"
549,00:32:37.23,00:32:37.23,"if you wish to assign it to somebody else, you can."
550,00:32:39.53,00:32:39.53,You have this afternoon to think about it.
551,00:32:41.53,00:32:41.53,You guys can head back to camp. >> Thank you.
552,00:33:27.87,00:33:27.87,>> The immunity challenge pissed the hell out of me.
553,00:33:31.80,00:33:31.80,I know I was clearly the best dart-blower there.
554,00:33:36.80,00:33:36.80,And they knocked me out so damn quick.
555,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,"My own team, Burton and Sandra, knocked me out."
556,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,Sandra truly was a mistake. I don't blame her at all.
557,00:33:47.53,00:33:47.53,"Burton, he knew what the hell he was doing."
558,00:33:51.17,00:33:51.17,">> You and I, we'll go all the way."
559,00:33:53.33,00:33:53.33,">> I know, dude. >> Like, I don't want to be in"
560,00:33:55.93,00:33:55.93,the final with anyone else... >> There's no one here.
561,00:33:57.97,00:33:57.97,There's no one else. >> ...for a number of reasons.
562,00:33:59.87,00:33:59.87,"But, if nothing else, I want to hang out"
563,00:34:01.80,00:34:01.80,with you that last day. >> Exactly.
564,00:34:03.77,00:34:03.77,>> I want you and I partying our ass off.
565,00:34:05.63,00:34:05.63,">> Exactly, man. I'm pretty happy right now"
566,00:34:07.63,00:34:07.63,"in that, uh, Rupert's going home tonight."
567,00:34:09.40,00:34:09.40,"Although, I promised him that I wouldn't write"
568,00:34:11.90,00:34:11.90,"his name down again, promises, to me,"
569,00:34:14.13,00:34:14.13,"uh, can be broken about as easily as a fat woman"
570,00:34:16.97,00:34:16.97,on wicker furniture. It's that simple.
571,00:34:36.33,00:34:36.33,>> I love... I love shell collecting.
572,00:34:38.10,00:34:38.10,I got tons of shells. >> Good therapy.
573,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,>> Yes. >> What needs to be done?
574,00:34:43.30,00:34:43.30,>> Shell collecting. >> I better get on
575,00:34:45.77,00:34:45.77,"my shell collecting, then. Burton and Jon keep"
576,00:34:48.80,00:34:48.80,pounding into my head-- this is a game!
577,00:34:53.60,00:34:53.60,"But I'd love to keep Rupert, because I love that man."
578,00:34:59.60,00:34:59.60,>> It's the same. It's the same. It's the same.
579,00:35:02.50,00:35:02.50,>> Yep. >> We target the Morgans first
580,00:35:04.73,00:35:04.73,and we got to get Darrah and Tijuana out
581,00:35:06.73,00:35:06.73,"before any of them, so they won't pass that damn"
582,00:35:09.43,00:35:09.43,immunity between each other. Darrah is still acting
583,00:35:12.20,00:35:12.20,like she's ready to go and packing and saying
584,00:35:14.80,00:35:14.80,her good-byes. But that could all be an act.
585,00:35:18.00,00:35:18.00,"Luckily, I have Lill on my side,"
586,00:35:20.00,00:35:20.00,I have Sandra on my side and I have Christa on my side.
587,00:35:22.70,00:35:22.70,Lill has been the key figure in a lot of votes lately.
588,00:35:26.73,00:35:26.73,"Is it still going to be Darrah? >> Uh, I don't care."
589,00:35:30.90,00:35:30.90,"I... I've said from the get-go, it doesn't make ... to me."
590,00:35:34.60,00:35:34.60,>> Okay. Okay. I'm going to go get dressed.
591,00:35:37.07,00:35:37.07,If they've turned and they've gotten
592,00:35:39.50,00:35:39.50,"Darrah, T, Jon and Burton together on one side,"
593,00:35:42.10,00:35:42.10,I've got my four on my side and we will have a tie.
594,00:35:44.90,00:35:44.90,We five stand strong together. >> That was my point
595,00:35:47.40,00:35:47.40,"the whole time. >> Burton said ""yeah."""
596,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"I want to see Sandra say ""yeah"" and look at me."
597,00:35:51.73,00:35:51.73,">> I'm good. >> I want to see you say ""yeah."""
598,00:35:54.17,00:35:54.17,">> I'll give you a ""hell, yeah."""
599,00:35:56.20,00:35:56.20,>> The vibe at the camp is that everybody's agreed
600,00:35:58.87,00:35:58.87,upon Darrah going home. Maybe Burton figured out
601,00:36:02.17,00:36:02.17,that there was a way between him and Jon
602,00:36:04.27,00:36:04.27,to get together and outmaneuver us three.
603,00:36:05.97,00:36:05.97,"But I don't see it happening. I just can't see it happening,"
604,00:36:08.53,00:36:08.53,"because all along they've said, ""It's going to be"
605,00:36:10.47,00:36:10.47,"the strong five and we'll separate from there."""
606,00:36:44.17,00:36:44.17,">> PROBST: We'll now bring in the first member of the jury,"
607,00:36:46.97,00:36:46.97,Ryno. Voted out at the
608,00:36:49.23,00:36:49.23,last Tribal Council. Ryno is here merely to observe.
609,00:36:56.70,00:36:56.70,He's just gathering information to help him make a very
610,00:36:59.27,00:36:59.27,important vote at the final Tribal Council.
611,00:37:01.83,00:37:01.83,Okay. 27 days-- that's a long time
612,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13,"to be out here. Sandra, is there anybody"
613,00:37:08.60,00:37:08.60,in this tribe you couldn't survive without?
614,00:37:12.23,00:37:12.23,Why Rupert? >> Rupert is the only one
615,00:37:15.20,00:37:15.20,"that brings fish, with the exception of the one"
616,00:37:17.63,00:37:17.63,that Burton brought. But Burton brings in stingrays.
617,00:37:20.40,00:37:20.40,"Um, we'd be assed-out if it wasn't for Rupert, assed-out."
618,00:37:25.90,00:37:25.90,">> PROBST: Lill, how important is Rupert's"
619,00:37:28.37,00:37:28.37,"fish-catching abilities? >> It is very important to us,"
620,00:37:32.10,00:37:32.10,but we also have another person who does do fishing.
621,00:37:35.87,00:37:35.87,">> PROBST: Burton, is there or is there not a"
622,00:37:39.00,00:37:39.00,little competition to be the alpha male
623,00:37:40.90,00:37:40.90,"between you and Rupert? >> No, I don't believe so."
624,00:37:43.90,00:37:43.90,"I mean, Rupert has definitely caught more fish than I have."
625,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,But there's no doubt in my mind that if one of us
626,00:37:49.77,00:37:49.77,"got struck by lightning, the tribe would get by."
627,00:37:52.13,00:37:52.13,">> PROBST: Sandra, you have become your own society,"
628,00:37:55.87,00:37:55.87,complete with leaders and followers.
629,00:37:58.80,00:37:58.80,Who here is getting a free ride? >> Let it be known
630,00:38:02.27,00:38:02.27,that Jon wakes up at noon and then he goes
631,00:38:05.47,00:38:05.47,under the bushes. He has this secret spot where
632,00:38:07.73,00:38:07.73,he takes an additional nap. I have yet to see him wash
633,00:38:10.90,00:38:10.90,"a dish or even clean a fish. >> PROBST: Jon, she pointed"
634,00:38:14.60,00:38:14.60,"a big, old, fat finger at you. >> That's fine."
635,00:38:17.13,00:38:17.13,"She gives me a headache. So, I could care less."
636,00:38:20.67,00:38:20.67,"It's all about her. >> PROBST: What's that, Jon?"
637,00:38:23.30,00:38:23.30,>> It's all about her. >> PROBST: Okay.
638,00:38:27.27,00:38:27.27,"Darrah, you seem like you've given up"
639,00:38:29.20,00:38:29.20,"to me. If you're going home tonight,"
640,00:38:32.40,00:38:32.40,"surprised? No, not surprised at all."
641,00:38:36.37,00:38:36.37,">> PROBST: Disappointed? >> Um, yeah, disappointed,"
642,00:38:38.53,00:38:38.53,"but not surprised. >> PROBST: All right, guys."
643,00:38:42.20,00:38:42.20,"Burton, you have immunity. It's yours to keep"
644,00:38:45.03,00:38:45.03,"or give away to somebody else, if you want to."
645,00:38:47.27,00:38:47.27,"Uh, I think I'll keep it. >> PROBST: All right."
646,00:38:49.53,00:38:49.53,"That being said, Burton cannot be voted for tonight."
647,00:38:53.47,00:38:53.47,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
648,00:38:56.67,00:38:56.67,"Christa, you're up. >> A Morgan has to go tonight."
649,00:39:16.43,00:39:16.43,And the other two work harder than you do.
650,00:39:38.57,00:39:38.57,">> To be the man, you got to beat the man."
651,00:39:41.27,00:39:41.27,Woo! >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
652,00:40:03.13,00:40:03.13,"votes. Once the votes are read,"
653,00:40:16.53,00:40:16.53,the decision is final. The person voted out
654,00:40:18.40,00:40:18.40,will be asked to leave the Tribal
655,00:40:20.37,00:40:20.37,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
656,00:40:26.13,00:40:26.13,First vote... Darrah.
657,00:40:34.87,00:40:34.87,Darrah. Two votes Darrah.
658,00:40:40.20,00:40:40.20,"Jon. Two votes Darrah,"
659,00:40:42.00,00:40:42.00,one vote Jon. Rupert.
660,00:40:47.17,00:40:47.17,One vote Rupert. Rupert.
661,00:40:52.33,00:40:52.33,"Two votes Rupert, two votes Darrah."
662,00:40:58.77,00:40:58.77,"Rupert. That's three votes Rupert,"
663,00:41:01.27,00:41:01.27,"two votes Darrah, one vote Jon."
664,00:41:06.87,00:41:06.87,Rupert. That's four votes Rupert.
665,00:41:13.30,00:41:13.30,Ninth person voted out of the tribe-- Rupert.
666,00:41:18.47,00:41:18.47,You need to bring me your torch.
667,00:41:28.30,00:41:28.30,">> I cannot believe that. >> PROBST: Rupert, the tribe has"
668,00:41:31.47,00:41:31.47,spoken. You guys can head
669,00:41:55.57,00:41:55.57,back to camp. Good night.

677,00:42:32.20,00:42:32.20,I got nothing to say to either one of you.

683,00:42:47.63,00:42:47.63,a lot better. I always get hurt
684,00:42:50.73,00:42:50.73,trusting people. I want so badly to be accepted
685,00:42:53.80,00:42:53.80,and I never get the acceptance that I want.
