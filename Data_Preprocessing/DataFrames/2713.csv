16,00:00:44.37,00:00:44.37,KATIE WAS SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

18,00:00:52.40,00:00:52.40,REDEMPTION ISLAND. FIVE ARE LEFT.

20,00:01:15.30,00:01:15.30,>> HI! >> OH!

23,00:01:22.17,00:01:22.17,>> KATIE'S HERE WITH ME SO OF COURSE I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE HER.
24,00:01:26.50,00:01:26.50,BUT I'M NOT HAPPY THAT SHE'S OUT OF THE GAME.
25,00:01:29.13,00:01:29.13,HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> WE HAD TO DRAW ROCKS TONIGHT.
26,00:01:32.37,00:01:32.37,>> UH-UH! >> OH!
27,00:01:34.87,00:01:34.87,>> AND YOU DREW THE ROCK? >> YEAH.
28,00:01:37.60,00:01:37.60,"BUT IT WAS JUST BETWEEN THREE OF US, THOUGH."
29,00:01:39.43,00:01:39.43,>> WHO DREW FIRST? >> I DREW FIRST.
30,00:01:41.60,00:01:41.60,TONIGHT WAS MY SHOT TO KNOCK TYSON OFF OF HIS THRONE AND I
31,00:01:44.63,00:01:44.63,COULD HAVE GONE FARTHERRER IN THE GAME IF THINGS WENT MY WAY
32,00:01:47.70,00:01:47.70,BUT I HAD THE WHITE ROCK. SO I WAS ROCKED OUT.
33,00:01:52.43,00:01:52.43,DO YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE JUST GONE WITH HAYDEN TONIGHT.
34,00:01:54.83,00:01:54.83,>> NO. YOU HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.
35,00:01:56.90,00:01:56.90,I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO DRAW ROCKS.
36,00:01:59.33,00:01:59.33,KUDOS TO THEM. BUT THIS WILL PROBABLY BE THE
37,00:02:02.90,00:02:02.90,TOUGHEST REDEMPTION ARENA BECAUSE KATIE AND I BOTH CAN'T
38,00:02:05.53,00:02:05.53,GO BACK INTO THE GAME. IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF US.
39,00:02:26.43,00:02:26.43,>> I THINK WE SHOULD BOTH TRY OUR HARDEST.
40,00:02:31.43,00:02:31.43,">> I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE STILL MY DAUGHTER."
41,00:02:34.67,00:02:34.67,IT'S HARD TO HAVE BEEN AT REDEMPTION ISLAND NOW FOR NINE
42,00:02:37.70,00:02:37.70,DAYS AND YOU HOPE TO GET BACK IN THE GAME AND TO FINISH WHAT YOU
43,00:02:40.90,00:02:40.90,STARTED BUT IT'S MY DAUGHTER AND THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE ABOVE ALL
44,00:02:45.60,00:02:45.60,THINGS. EVEN A MILLION DOLLARS.
45,00:02:48.57,00:02:48.57,"I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU, KATIE. >> THANK YOU."
46,00:02:57.10,00:02:57.10,">> WOW! CRAZY PLAY, GUYS."
47,00:03:02.07,00:03:02.07,">> CIERA, I OWE YOU A HUG. >> YOU GUYS KNOW I LOVE"
48,00:03:06.37,00:03:06.37,"EVERYONE, RIGHT? >> YEAH, NO, THAT WAS A GREAT"
49,00:03:08.83,00:03:08.83,PLAY. I WAS EXCITED TO BE PART OF IT.
50,00:03:10.37,00:03:10.37,IF I WERE KATIE I WOULDN'T EXCITED TO BE PART OF IT BUT --
51,00:03:13.30,00:03:13.30,>> GREAT JOB. >> CRAZY!
52,00:03:16.17,00:03:16.17,"GREAT JOB. >> MONICA, I LOVE YOU."
53,00:03:19.47,00:03:19.47,I HAD TO FIGHT HARD THROUGH EVERYTHING.
54,00:03:22.93,00:03:22.93,I KNEW YOU WAS GOING HOME SO -- TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT WAS
55,00:03:26.93,00:03:26.93,INSANE! I'M LITERALLY -- I'M FIGHTING
56,00:03:29.33,00:03:29.33,FOR MY LIFE IN THE GAME. AND THEN THE VERY NEXT MOMENT
57,00:03:32.20,00:03:32.20,WE'RE DRAWING ROCKS AND I REALIZE THIS WORKED!
58,00:03:35.80,00:03:35.80,"LIKE, WHAT? I'M SAFE!"
59,00:03:38.60,00:03:38.60,BEST-CASE SCENARIO WOULD HAVE BEEN TYSON DREW THE WHITE ROCK
60,00:03:41.27,00:03:41.27,AND WENT HOME. THAT WOULD HAVE FLIPPED THE
61,00:03:43.77,00:03:43.77,SCRIPT. FLIPPED IT.
62,00:03:44.77,00:03:44.77,BUT ONE THING THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE IS I'M GOING TO BE
63,00:03:47.60,00:03:47.60,WITH CIERA ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
64,00:03:49.53,00:03:49.53,YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING.
65,00:03:51.33,00:03:51.33,"TRY, TRY, TRY. >> RIGHT."
66,00:03:52.70,00:03:52.70,THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TELL AN INSANE PERSON THEY'RE NEXT TO
67,00:03:55.87,00:03:55.87,GO-- GERVASE. >> YOU SAYING I'M INSANE?
68,00:03:58.33,00:03:58.33,">> THE LAST THREE DAYS PROBABLY PRETTY MUCH, YEAH."
69,00:04:01.40,00:04:01.40,YOU CAN'T EVER LET THE PERSON ON THE BOTTOM KNOW THEY'RE GOING
70,00:04:04.70,00:04:04.70,"HOME. THAT'S ""SURVIVOR"" 101."
71,00:04:06.47,00:04:06.47,IT GIVES THEM A CHANCE TO BE CRAZY.
72,00:04:08.40,00:04:08.40,YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM HOPE. YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM SOMEBODY
73,00:04:10.83,00:04:10.83,ELSE'S NAME. BECAUSE THEN THE FIREWORKS
74,00:04:14.83,00:04:14.83,"WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. >> THESE GUYS STICKING WITH ME,"
75,00:04:17.77,00:04:17.77,I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT WAS ABOUT.
76,00:04:19.43,00:04:19.43,"I PICKED UP MY BAG AND SAID OKAY, I'M LEAVING AND YOU GUYS"
77,00:04:24.03,00:04:24.03,-- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU GUYS STUCK WITH ME!
78,00:04:27.27,00:04:27.27,I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. >> THERE'S YOUR LINE IN THE
79,00:04:32.10,00:04:32.10,"SAND. >> BUT DON'T WORRY, I'VE ALREADY"
80,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,GOT HER PULLING BACK OVER HERE. I GOT HER.
81,00:04:37.23,00:04:37.23,NOW YOU'RE ALL ALONE AGAIN. >> I FEEL LIKE I'M ALWAYS IN THE
82,00:04:40.73,00:04:40.73,MIDDLE. >> WE HAVE A GOOD ALLIANCE AND I
83,00:04:42.30,00:04:42.30,FEEL LIKE I'M IN A GOOD POSITION.
84,00:04:44.47,00:04:44.47,BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT IF THEY HAVE AN IDOL ONE OF US IS GOING
85,00:04:52.33,00:04:52.33,"HOME. >> MONICA, SHE'S CRUCIAL TO MY"
86,00:05:04.93,00:05:04.93,GAME RIGHT NOW BUT SHE WILL NOT STOP TALKING AND IT'S ANNOYING.
87,00:05:08.80,00:05:08.80,"IT WAS LIKE STOP PLAYING THE GAME, MONICA, YOU'RE PLAYING TOO"
88,00:05:12.03,00:05:12.03,HARD RIGHT NOW. >> I'M IN THIS WITH TYSON AND
89,00:05:25.80,00:05:25.80,GERVASE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE ANY RESPECT HERE.
90,00:05:27.67,00:05:27.67,I FELT LIKE WITHHOLDING THAT CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION OF
91,00:05:30.53,00:05:30.53,"HAVING AN IDOL THE WHOLE TIME, IT HURT ME."
92,00:05:33.50,00:05:33.50,AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. IT IS WHAT IT IS.
93,00:05:37.83,00:05:37.83,">> SLEEP TIGHT, MONICA. >> GOOD NIGHT, GUYS."
94,00:05:40.47,00:05:40.47,>> SEE YOU IN THE MORNING. >> SHE'S NOT GREAT AT
95,00:05:45.57,00:05:45.57,"""SURVIVOR,"" BUT SHE'S REALLY >> OH, YOU HERE IN THE HAMMOCK."
96,00:06:25.57,00:06:25.57,I WAS LIKE WHERE THE HECK IS CIERA AT?
97,00:06:27.10,00:06:27.10,>> AFTER TRIBAL LAST NIGHT I FEEL LIKE A HUGE WEIGHT JUST
98,00:06:29.70,00:06:29.70,LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS. I KNEW I WAS NUMBER FOUR SO MY
99,00:06:33.90,00:06:33.90,"MIND WENT YOU KNOW WHAT, CIERA? THIS IS THE MOVE."
100,00:06:36.67,00:06:36.67,IF IT'S THE MOVE THAT SENDS YOU HOME AT LEAST YOU WENT OUT
101,00:06:39.87,00:06:39.87,TRYING TO MAKE A MOVE VERSUS RIDING TO THE FOUR AND NOT
102,00:06:42.50,00:06:42.50,SAYING YOU EVEN TRIED ANYTHING. EVEN IT ENDED UP KATIE GOING
103,00:06:46.30,00:06:46.30,HOME WHICH SUCKED FOR US AT LEAST WE MADE A MOVE.
104,00:06:48.87,00:06:48.87,BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY.
105,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,>> IF YOU DON'T GO DOWN FIGHTING YOU'RE GOING TO BE PISSED.
106,00:06:54.43,00:06:54.43,"YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT. >> I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T"
107,00:06:57.50,00:06:57.50,PAN OUT THE WAY I WANTED IT TO PAN OUT.
108,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67,KATIE WENT HOME. WE'RE DOWN NUMBERS NOW 2-3.
109,00:07:02.77,00:07:02.77,BUT MY MOM BASED ON HER TRACK RECORD WILL BE THE ONE COMING
110,00:07:05.20,00:07:05.20,BACK WHICH WOULD GIVE ME AND HAYDEN THE NUMBERS.
111,00:07:07.80,00:07:07.80,AND THE FIRST TIME I WANT HER TO COME OUT.

114,00:07:15.23,00:07:15.23,WEDGE BETWEEN THEM. >> I WAS THINKING THAT SAME
115,00:07:17.93,00:07:17.93,THING. HAYDEN AND I ARE BOUND AND

124,00:08:08.73,00:08:08.73,THIS IS YET ANOTHER LAYER OF BLOOD VERSUS WATER.
125,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,"YOU'RE OUT OF THE GAME, SO IS YOUR DAUGHTER, ONLY ONE PERSON"
126,00:08:14.90,00:08:14.90,CAN GET BACK IN THE GAME SO NOW YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST HER.

379,00:24:57.23,00:24:57.23,HAYDEN HAS ALREADY STARTED. GERVASE IS IN ON IT.
380,00:25:00.07,00:25:00.07,MONICA IS WORKING ON IT. YOU ARE FORMING AN EIGHT-WORD

400,00:26:38.97,00:26:38.97,CIERA THINKS SHE'S ON TO SOMETHING.
401,00:26:43.70,00:26:43.70,GERVASE THINKS HE HAS SOMETHING. MAYBE HE HAS AN IDEA THAT'S
402,00:26:47.10,00:26:47.10,RIGHT. HE HAS SIX WORDS.
403,00:26:50.23,00:26:50.23,CIERA HAS SIX. THEY ARE NECK IN NECK.

462,00:30:24.17,00:30:24.17,THINK TYSON HAS AN IDOL. >> AND I'M GOING TO TELL HER

467,00:30:38.60,00:30:38.60,CHOICE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS THE CRACK IN THE ALLIANCE
468,00:30:41.33,00:30:41.33,"BETWEEN GERVASE, TYSON, AND MONICA."
469,00:30:43.50,00:30:43.50,AND MONICA IS DEFINITELY THE CRACK.
470,00:30:45.30,00:30:45.30,>> SO YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO MONICA?
471,00:30:47.33,00:30:47.33,>> YEAH. SHE'S AN EMOTIONAL WRECK OUT
472,00:30:49.50,00:30:49.50,HERE RIGHT NOW SO IF I CAN PLAY ON THAT AND IF I CAN THROW TYSON

474,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,AND HAYDEN. SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU--
475,00:31:06.40,00:31:06.40,HONEST. >> OKAY.

482,00:31:25.47,00:31:25.47,HE SAID YOU'RE WEAK. HE SAID YOU'RE PARANOID.
483,00:31:28.40,00:31:28.40,AND HE SAID YOU'RE A PUPPY ON HIS LEASH AND YOU'LL VOTE
484,00:31:31.53,00:31:31.53,"HOWEVER. HE'S LIKE ""DON'T WORRY, MONICA'S"

534,00:34:41.10,00:34:41.10,THERE'S ONE REASON WE'RE KEEPING MONICA AROUND AND THAT'S BECAUSE
535,00:34:45.00,00:34:45.00,THEY THINK THEY CAN BEATER IN THE END.
536,00:34:47.13,00:34:47.13,THEY DREW A ROCK BECAUSE TYSON KNOWS IF MONICA ISN'T AROUND HE
537,00:34:50.03,00:34:50.03,CAN'T BEAT ANYBODY ELSE. >> I DREW ROCKS BECAUSE I KNEW I
538,00:34:52.43,00:34:52.43,COULD TRUST MONICA TO THE END. >> I'M SURE.
