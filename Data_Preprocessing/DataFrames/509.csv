2,00:00:03.23,00:00:03.23, Chuay Gahn and Sook Jai struggled
3,00:00:04.53,00:00:04.53, with living together as separate tribes.
4,00:00:07.23,00:00:07.23,"BRIAN: When I look at Sook Jai, I see enemy."
5,00:00:09.63,00:00:09.63," I can't just, all of a sudden, ""Oh, great, one happy family."""
6,00:00:12.13,00:00:12.13,It's not gonna happen.They're gonna have to earn that.
7,00:00:13.80,00:00:13.80,KEN: There's definitelya strategic reason to get along
8,00:00:15.77,00:00:15.77," with these people, because"
9,00:00:17.27,00:00:17.27,things change real quick.
10,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57,PROBST: The immunity challenge
11,00:00:20.07,00:00:20.07, became a showdown between Brian and Jake.
12,00:00:23.17,00:00:23.17,The only way Sook Jai can winis if Jake
13,00:00:25.73,00:00:25.73,stays under the waterlonger than Brian.
14,00:00:28.17,00:00:28.17," But Jake gave up too soon,"
15,00:00:29.83,00:00:29.83, handing Chuay Gahn their victory.
16,00:00:31.90,00:00:31.90,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
17,00:00:33.37,00:00:33.37,(cheering)
18,00:00:35.10,00:00:35.10," Back at camp,there was an uneasy atmosphere,"
19,00:00:37.77,00:00:37.77, as the winners and losers tried to coexist.
20,00:00:40.57,00:00:40.57,"TED: It's like we can'tfully enjoy our win, because"
21,00:00:43.87,00:00:43.87,we kind of like you guys.
22,00:00:45.27,00:00:45.27,"CLAY: That's what we're trying to tell them,"
23,00:00:47.13,00:00:47.13,"""Oh, we're so sorryy'all got to go"
24,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,"to Tribal Council and that,""but we were so damn happy."
25,00:00:50.97,00:00:50.97,"PROBST: Before Tribal Council,"
26,00:00:52.33,00:00:52.33, Sook Jai made an emotional pact.
27,00:00:54.47,00:00:54.47,Do we want to go aheadand reveal who's going tonight?
28,00:00:58.57,00:00:58.57,I would only want to knowif everybody's in agreement
29,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00,that that's whatwe're going to do.
30,00:01:02.40,00:01:02.40,"PENNY: Well, let's just save itfor Tribal Council, then."
31,00:01:04.73,00:01:04.73,JAKE: It's tough when you have to
32,00:01:06.30,00:01:06.30,vote somebody off that you love.
33,00:01:09.30,00:01:09.30,"PROBST: In a difficult decision, the members of the tribe"
34,00:01:11.60,00:01:11.60, reluctantly said good-bye to Erin.
35,00:01:15.17,00:01:15.17,First member of our jury: Erin.
36,00:01:18.13,00:01:18.13,The tribe has spoken.
37,00:01:21.53,00:01:21.53, Eight are left.
38,00:01:22.63,00:01:22.63, Who will be voted out tonight?
39,00:02:35.57,00:02:35.57,TED: Everyone deserveswhat they're getting right now.
40,00:02:38.73,00:02:38.73,"-We deserve to be right here,-I know. Oh, no."
41,00:02:40.90,00:02:40.90,-boiling the soup.-No argument about that.
42,00:02:42.57,00:02:42.57,"While the other teamis going to Tribal Council,"
43,00:02:44.23,00:02:44.23,because we worked our butt off
44,00:02:45.93,00:02:45.93,to get to where we areright now.
45,00:02:47.73,00:02:47.73,"TED: In the beginning, a lot of people didn't predict this."
46,00:02:50.57,00:02:50.57, A lot of people would never ever
47,00:02:52.10,00:02:52.10,have thoughtthat Chuay Gahn would be
48,00:02:54.33,00:02:54.33,this powerful at this point.
49,00:02:55.73,00:02:55.73," Um, whether it's a merger or a non-merger,"
50,00:02:58.23,00:02:58.23," Chuay Gahn is in a very, very power position"
51,00:03:01.40,00:03:01.40, to do whatever we want.
52,00:03:03.00,00:03:03.00,BRIAN:We went through our down time.
53,00:03:04.57,00:03:04.57,"-JAN: Oh, absolutely.-So it's their turn."
54,00:03:06.77,00:03:06.77,You know?
55,00:03:07.90,00:03:07.90,-It's definitely their turn.-CLAY: Yeah.
56,00:03:09.37,00:03:09.37,JAN: Sook Jai left to go to Tribal Council.
57,00:03:11.73,00:03:11.73, They had to vote someone off.
58,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83," Of course then we tried to guess who was going to go,"
59,00:03:15.63,00:03:15.63," and, uh, it was half and half."
60,00:03:17.73,00:03:17.73,We thought Erinand we thought Ken.
61,00:03:20.23,00:03:20.23,"TED:Penny, Penny."
62,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,Jeff just axed Penny.
63,00:03:24.03,00:03:24.03,"Who you gonna, uh--How you voting tonight and why?"
64,00:03:27.00,00:03:27.00,Um...
65,00:03:28.00,00:03:28.00,"Is Penny voting, you guys?"
66,00:03:29.23,00:03:29.23,"Um, I think I'm going tohave to go with..."
67,00:03:31.57,00:03:31.57,"JAN:Oh, dear leader, I don't know!"
68,00:03:34.43,00:03:34.43,(laughter)
69,00:03:35.60,00:03:35.60,"Oh, I don't know."
70,00:03:37.07,00:03:37.07,I think I'm going to have tostab my friend Erin in the back
71,00:03:39.70,00:03:39.70,-and take her out.-(laughter)
72,00:03:41.60,00:03:41.60,"TED:Okay, down at the end?"
73,00:03:43.40,00:03:43.40,"JAN:NYC, himself."

76,00:03:48.10,00:03:48.10,(laughter)
77,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,"By the way, by the way,Jeff, by the way,"
78,00:03:51.30,00:03:51.30,"I just want to make sureeveryone knows,"
79,00:03:52.73,00:03:52.73,"I am a New York police officer,one of its finest,"
80,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,"-and, uh, damned if you won't...-And I don't want the women"
81,00:03:57.77,00:03:57.77,-to know that.-You won't... won't believe that
82,00:03:59.43,00:03:59.43,"the, uh, uh-- when youput on a uniform,"
83,00:04:01.33,00:04:01.33,you get all kinds of bitches.
84,00:04:02.70,00:04:02.70,(laughter)
85,00:04:04.10,00:04:04.10,"Yo, yo, yo, yo."
86,00:04:05.70,00:04:05.70,JAN: We did feel sorry for them
87,00:04:07.37,00:04:07.37," having to lose someone, but we were"
88,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,glad it was them and not us.(laughs)
89,00:04:11.40,00:04:11.40,You think that's them?
90,00:04:13.57,00:04:13.57,"Wow, you supposethey're back already?"
91,00:04:17.20,00:04:17.20,PENNY: It was really hard to come back
92,00:04:18.97,00:04:18.97," after, uh, we voted Erin out,"
93,00:04:20.97,00:04:20.97,"because now we weredown to three people,"
94,00:04:22.97,00:04:22.97,and Chuay Gahn has five.
95,00:04:24.40,00:04:24.40,JAKE:It's a tough game.
96,00:04:26.17,00:04:26.17,KEN:Sure is.
97,00:04:27.17,00:04:27.17,PENNY: I love you guys.Let's stay tight.

99,00:04:30.43,00:04:30.43,-Stay tight.-That's it-- hang tough.
100,00:04:32.43,00:04:32.43,JAKE: We're still two separate tribes.
101,00:04:34.93,00:04:34.93," We need to be able to win an immunity challenge,"
102,00:04:37.43,00:04:37.43, and we need to get a plan together
103,00:04:39.63,00:04:39.63,and figure out how we can getahead on the vote somehow.
104,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63, We've got to fight for everything we're going to get.
105,00:04:47.33,00:04:47.33,-JAN: They're walking in.-HELEN: Here they are.
106,00:04:48.80,00:04:48.80,TED: Your questions shall beanswered in a short second.
107,00:04:52.47,00:04:52.47,Survey says?
108,00:04:54.07,00:04:54.07,"JAKE:Guys, we're back, minus one."
109,00:04:58.43,00:04:58.43,CLAY:Who'd we lose?
110,00:04:59.77,00:04:59.77,PENNY:We lost Erin.
111,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,BRIAN:Oh.
112,00:05:02.73,00:05:02.73,-How was the Council?-JAKE: Sucked.
113,00:05:04.23,00:05:04.23,We don't want to go back.
114,00:05:06.63,00:05:06.63,CLAY:How did Erin take it?
115,00:05:08.60,00:05:08.60,JAKE:She took it hard.
116,00:05:10.83,00:05:10.83,So did we.
117,00:05:12.17,00:05:12.17,PENNY:Thanks for waiting up.
118,00:05:13.60,00:05:13.60,CLAY:You bet.
119,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87,I'm sorry y'all have toexperience this with us.
120,00:05:17.23,00:05:17.23,JAKE:Yeah.
121,00:05:18.43,00:05:18.43,"That's all right,that's all right."
122,00:05:20.17,00:05:20.17,"Thank you, guys,for mourning with us."
123,00:05:22.87,00:05:22.87,KEN:Thank you.
124,00:05:23.87,00:05:23.87,BRIAN:Y'all tired?
125,00:05:25.13,00:05:25.13,"Uh, I don't know whetherI'm tired or depressed."
126,00:05:27.97,00:05:27.97,That really takes it out of you.
127,00:05:29.20,00:05:29.20,Losing somebodythat's been with you
128,00:05:31.20,00:05:31.20,for as long asshe's been with us.
129,00:05:32.93,00:05:32.93,PENNY:Hardest thing I've had to do.
130,00:05:34.93,00:05:34.93,She's been my sleeping partnerfor the past 24 days.
131,00:05:37.27,00:05:37.27,JAN:Yep.
132,00:05:38.70,00:05:38.70,"Yeah, she was like a sisterto me; she still is."
133,00:05:41.37,00:05:41.37,JAN:It's hard.
134,00:05:56.53,00:05:56.53,"JAKE: Man, what an interesting time we're having now."
135,00:06:01.07,00:06:01.07, I think what everybody on both sides
136,00:06:02.97,00:06:02.97, is trying to do is put their best foot forward
137,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87, and just kind of see what's going to happen next.
138,00:06:09.33,00:06:09.33, So I've got to figure out
139,00:06:10.87,00:06:10.87,how I can best fit in.
140,00:06:13.00,00:06:13.00,Y'all want to hear aboutthe first time
141,00:06:14.33,00:06:14.33,I ever shotwith a bow and arrow?
142,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,-TED AND JAN: Yeah.-It's a hysterical story.
143,00:06:18.00,00:06:18.00,"First I heard this squirreljust barking,"
144,00:06:19.73,00:06:19.73,just chattering up a storm.
145,00:06:21.20,00:06:21.20,"I said, well, I wonderwhat he's looking at,"
146,00:06:23.13,00:06:23.13,"so I started sneaking overto where he was,"
147,00:06:24.93,00:06:24.93,and I looked up there and therewas a little six-point buck.
148,00:06:27.57,00:06:27.57,TED: What Jake has been doing a lot is that he'll sit around
149,00:06:30.77,00:06:30.77, and start telling some of the adventures
150,00:06:32.93,00:06:32.93," that he's been on, as if"
151,00:06:34.70,00:06:34.70,we're going to beoverly wowed by that.
152,00:06:37.60,00:06:37.60,"JAKE: Well, here I am standingthere with a bow and arrow"
153,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,and my heart starts...(imitates loud heartbeat)
154,00:06:43.47,00:06:43.47,And darn if he didn't startwalking toward me.
155,00:06:46.40,00:06:46.40,JAKE: I guess what I'm trying to do by sharing stories
156,00:06:49.90,00:06:49.90," is to say, guys,"
157,00:06:51.27,00:06:51.27,"I'm an adventurer just like you,"
158,00:06:52.83,00:06:52.83,I just happen to bean old adventurer.
159,00:06:54.87,00:06:54.87,"All of a sudden, he lookedup at me, just straight at me"
160,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,and I had the prettiestopen chest and neck shot
161,00:07:02.27,00:07:02.27,that you've ever seenin your life.
162,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,(clicks tongue)
163,00:07:05.60,00:07:05.60,"I let go of that arrow,hit him right square in the ass."
164,00:07:09.40,00:07:09.40,(laughter)
165,00:07:11.23,00:07:11.23,Everybody in the group aresick of his Roy Roger tales.
166,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00,"Then all of a sudden, I hearthis, ""Open your parachute!"
167,00:07:18.50,00:07:18.50,"Grab your rip cord!"""
168,00:07:20.23,00:07:20.23,And I drifted right overan airport runway.
169,00:07:22.23,00:07:22.23,"BRIAN:Oh, my gosh."
170,00:07:24.13,00:07:24.13,And I hit that groundand just--
171,00:07:26.67,00:07:26.67,My ankle went ka-bap!
172,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,-Just snapped it.-Just snapped it.
173,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,"TED: Well, I don't know a lot about parachuting,"
174,00:07:33.40,00:07:33.40, but that was a little far-fetched for me.
175,00:07:35.10,00:07:35.10," I mean, and in the middle of an airport?"
176,00:07:37.07,00:07:37.07,"Uh, I would imagine that'ssome type of FAA violation."
177,00:07:41.27,00:07:41.27,"I've had both my anklesbroken twice, see."

463,00:20:10.93,00:20:10.93,"If my wife does anythingembarrassing, I apologize."
464,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,She's a little crazy.(chuckles)
465,00:20:15.70,00:20:15.70,"Hey, honey! Congratulations."
466,00:20:17.63,00:20:17.63,"I guess you won...whatever,"
467,00:20:20.40,00:20:20.40,because you're watchingthis tape.
468,00:20:21.77,00:20:21.77,"Say hey, Logan."
469,00:20:22.83,00:20:22.83,"""Hey, Daddy!"""

472,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,I miss you. I love you.
473,00:20:29.93,00:20:29.93,"Also, I've beengetting in shape."
474,00:20:32.37,00:20:32.37,"Look at those muscles, yeah!"
475,00:20:34.80,00:20:34.80,"(chuckles) Logey and I,we're going to party."
476,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,"Now that you're gone,we're going to party."
477,00:20:38.30,00:20:38.30,"See, I told you.What'd I tell y'all?"
478,00:20:39.67,00:20:39.67,So Logey and I aregoing to go downstairs
479,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,and we're going to go dance.
480,00:20:42.63,00:20:42.63,(music playing)
481,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,"Logan's like, ""What the..."""

484,00:20:49.77,00:20:49.77,"BRIAN:Oh, my gosh, that's too funny."
485,00:20:51.87,00:20:51.87,"CLAY: She's a fox, I'm going to tell you."
486,00:20:54.47,00:20:54.47," She's a fine-looking woman, and, uh..."
487,00:20:57.00,00:20:57.00,"Buddy, she's-she's fit for thebikinis, I'm going to tell you."
488,00:20:59.90,00:20:59.90,BRIAN: Sorry if she getsa little crazy here.
489,00:21:02.17,00:21:02.17,(laughs)That's okay.
490,00:21:04.37,00:21:04.37,"BRIAN: She kept her clothes on, which I was happy about,"
491,00:21:06.37,00:21:06.37,"but, uh, I didn't want everyone"
492,00:21:07.80,00:21:07.80,to know more about methan they should.
493,00:21:09.40,00:21:09.40,"It's almost one ofthose things where, uh,"
494,00:21:11.70,00:21:11.70,I didn't think it was necessary for them to see my family.
495,00:21:13.53,00:21:13.53,The house is a real mess.
496,00:21:16.20,00:21:16.20,"-Why don't you clean up?-I'll show it to you, anyway."
497,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,"Is this kind of weird,seeing your house?"
498,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,"Yeah, it's really weird."
499,00:21:21.40,00:21:21.40,And here's your lovely pianothat we miss you playing.
500,00:21:25.80,00:21:25.80,(playing discordant notes)
501,00:21:29.37,00:21:29.37,There's the beater.
502,00:21:31.10,00:21:31.10,There's your car.
503,00:21:33.10,00:21:33.10,"The Caddy, Caddy, Caddy."
504,00:21:35.33,00:21:35.33,HELEN: With the nice two brand-new cars

506,00:21:39.93,00:21:39.93,it looks like Brian's doingpretty damn good for himself.
507,00:21:43.33,00:21:43.33," If I were against Brian right now,"
508,00:21:45.03,00:21:45.03," that'd be enough to vote him off, because I'd be going,"
509,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50," ""This guy doesn't need the money."""
510,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,"We want you to come home soon,and we want you to win"

512,00:21:56.50,00:21:56.50,Love you.
513,00:21:58.63,00:21:58.63,Bye.(smooching)
514,00:22:11.23,00:22:11.23,"JAN:""Chuay Jai."""
515,00:22:12.77,00:22:12.77,"Underneath that, ""Survivor 5."""
516,00:22:14.70,00:22:14.70,Then the rest of the goalis going to have each person
517,00:22:17.57,00:22:17.57,with their handon the top and the bottom.
518,00:22:19.60,00:22:19.60,"That'd be real neat,to put all of our handprints."
519,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"CLAY: We had a little challenge,"
520,00:22:23.57,00:22:23.57," and, uh, found out we was all one tribe."
521,00:22:26.00,00:22:26.00," And now is when the game's gonna start,"
522,00:22:27.30,00:22:27.30,'cause I'm gonna tell you what.
523,00:22:28.50,00:22:28.50,"Hell, I'm here to wina million dollars."
524,00:22:30.33,00:22:30.33,"To outplay, outwit and outlast."

526,00:22:33.63,00:22:33.63,-You said you wanted to putour handprints on it? -Yeah.
527,00:22:35.57,00:22:35.57,"JAN:Oh, that's great."
528,00:22:37.93,00:22:37.93,That looks great.
529,00:22:40.13,00:22:40.13,My main concern was getting tothis point to where now we have
530,00:22:42.63,00:22:42.63,"individual challenges,and it could help me."
531,00:22:44.70,00:22:44.70,I'm going to be a viable threat for that immunity
532,00:22:48.10,00:22:48.10, every time it comes around.
533,00:22:49.60,00:22:49.60,-TED: Oh.-Got it.
534,00:22:50.93,00:22:50.93,-Good deal.-That is good.
535,00:22:52.40,00:22:52.40,"Okay, who's next?"
536,00:22:54.07,00:22:54.07,"BRIAN: We've now come to a merger,"
537,00:22:55.60,00:22:55.60," which is a crossroads, and it's a new game."
538,00:22:58.37,00:22:58.37,You've got two former enemiesthat are now sleeping together.
539,00:23:03.13,00:23:03.13,But right now it doesn't matter
540,00:23:04.70,00:23:04.70,whether it wassomebody from my tribe
541,00:23:06.40,00:23:06.40,or somebodyfrom the other tribe.
542,00:23:07.90,00:23:07.90," Whoever's getting on someone's nerves,"
543,00:23:10.13,00:23:10.13, that's pretty much how the vote's going to go.
544,00:23:12.13,00:23:12.13,PENNY: You know what?That refried bean dip
545,00:23:14.20,00:23:14.20,"with cream cheese, there's sourcream in there, too."
546,00:23:16.47,00:23:16.47,"-HELEN: There... Okay, I waswondering. -I forgot."
547,00:23:17.83,00:23:17.83,"'Cause it was sounding reallythick to me, but... -Yeah."
548,00:23:19.53,00:23:19.53,-I thoughtabout that last night. -Okay.
549,00:23:22.47,00:23:22.47,"TED: Helen would be talking about recipes and food,"
550,00:23:25.80,00:23:25.80," and those things were really, really, really"
551,00:23:27.60,00:23:27.60, starting to bother me.
552,00:23:29.73,00:23:29.73,"KEN:Are you sleeping, Ted?"
553,00:23:31.30,00:23:31.30,"Just, uh, resting the eyes."
554,00:23:34.13,00:23:34.13," TED: I felt myself, little small things"
555,00:23:36.20,00:23:36.20,starting to get on my nerve.
556,00:23:38.20,00:23:38.20," You know, I was feeling"
557,00:23:39.40,00:23:39.40, grumpier and grumpier and grumpier.
558,00:23:41.80,00:23:41.80,"So, wh-what do you put-- what'sin that sauce, to flavor yours?"
559,00:23:44.43,00:23:44.43,"JAN:It's got Worcester, soy sauce..."
560,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43,"TED: I internalized all of that, and I said, um, it's time."
561,00:23:49.73,00:23:49.73, It's time for me to get away and to get some me time.
562,00:23:59.37,00:23:59.37, It was some real good quality me time.
563,00:24:03.10,00:24:03.10,I think the reason why a lot ofpeople don't take the me time
564,00:24:06.77,00:24:06.77, is because they don't want to be
565,00:24:08.43,00:24:08.43,perceived as a loner or
566,00:24:11.57,00:24:11.57," somebody out there, not a part of the team,"
567,00:24:14.40,00:24:14.40, that type of thing.
568,00:24:15.77,00:24:15.77, I honestly am taking a risk by doing that.
569,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,Ted just went off on the canoe.
570,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,He didn't tell anyone.
571,00:24:26.10,00:24:26.10,He probably didn't meanto go out that far.
572,00:24:29.07,00:24:29.07,"Probably just neededto get away, you know."
573,00:24:30.93,00:24:30.93,PENNY: I think Ted kind of
574,00:24:32.73,00:24:32.73," goes off and does his own thing sometimes,"
575,00:24:35.13,00:24:35.13, and sometimes I don't think he fits in with the group
576,00:24:38.27,00:24:38.27,maybe as well ashe may think that he does.
577,00:24:41.47,00:24:41.47,"Ted is not that fast, I mean..."
578,00:24:42.83,00:24:42.83,No.
579,00:24:44.17,00:24:44.17,-He can't swim at all.-He can't swim worth--
580,00:24:45.83,00:24:45.83,He's not--he's too big to run.
581,00:24:47.13,00:24:47.13,Mm-hmm.
582,00:24:48.27,00:24:48.27,CLAY: As long as I just don't-- just kind of leave
583,00:24:51.27,00:24:51.27,"-him alone, he's not gonna pissme off. -You gotta be real..."
584,00:24:53.70,00:24:53.70,-It's his way or the highway.-Ted doesn't like...
585,00:24:55.13,00:24:55.13,"Ted doesn't, you know--he ain't got a clue."
586,00:24:57.77,00:24:57.77,BRIAN: It's just amazing how out here
587,00:24:59.57,00:24:59.57,"the littlest things tick peopleoff or get under someone's skin,"
588,00:25:03.40,00:25:03.40," which is so interesting to me, how such a small, minute thing"
589,00:25:05.90,00:25:05.90, out here can really escalate
590,00:25:07.10,00:25:07.10,"into a, uh, bigger problemdown the road."
591,00:25:09.67,00:25:09.67,We're just trying to get him--we got to get him on the jury.
592,00:25:11.87,00:25:11.87,That'll secure me and you
593,00:25:13.50,00:25:13.50,-immunity all the way in.-Okay.
594,00:25:15.33,00:25:15.33,"Okay, you got it."
595,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,"BRIAN: With regards to my alliance with Ted,"
596,00:25:18.20,00:25:18.20," I think that once it does get down to either him or me,"
597,00:25:21.17,00:25:21.17,obviously I'm going to be
598,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,looking aftergood old number one.
599,00:25:23.57,00:25:23.57,I-I think if we justplay it a little bit cool
600,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,"and just marchright on in there,"
601,00:25:28.10,00:25:28.10,that would secure usall the way to the top two.
602,00:25:30.37,00:25:30.37,"Okay, yeah."
603,00:25:31.77,00:25:31.77,(sighs)
604,00:25:38.30,00:25:38.30,JAKE: I'm right in the midst of trying to find
605,00:25:40.50,00:25:40.50, somebody that will get on my team from the other side.
606,00:25:43.60,00:25:43.60,And I don't know who I can truston the other team.
607,00:25:45.63,00:25:45.63,That's the problem.
608,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,"Ted-- everybody's tired of Ted,getting tired of Ted, so..."
609,00:25:50.50,00:25:50.50,"They like him,they love him to death,"
610,00:25:52.23,00:25:52.23,"but just his attitudeis, uh, getting pretty old."
611,00:25:56.47,00:25:56.47,"So, in your estimation,"
612,00:25:57.90,00:25:57.90,that's probablywho you'd go for first?
613,00:26:00.07,00:26:00.07,"If it was right now, yeah."
614,00:26:02.03,00:26:02.03,"JAKE: From Clay, I got a sense that they're all"
615,00:26:04.47,00:26:04.47, really tired of Ted today.
616,00:26:06.23,00:26:06.23,He said that's probablywho they'd vote off
617,00:26:08.03,00:26:08.03,if they had to vote today.
618,00:26:09.80,00:26:09.80,"At first, I would'vedefinitely said, uh, Ken,"
619,00:26:12.53,00:26:12.53,"but then everybody telling you,""He's a pretty good ol' guy."
620,00:26:14.63,00:26:14.63,"He's a pretty good ol' guy."""
621,00:26:15.93,00:26:15.93,"JAKE: Clay said, uh, we were"
622,00:26:18.10,00:26:18.10, ready to vote Ken out.
623,00:26:19.67,00:26:19.67, Now it's very likely going to be Ted.
624,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,"You know, if we can getsome kind of an alliance"
625,00:26:24.60,00:26:24.60,"cooking right now, we can..."
626,00:26:26.77,00:26:26.77,we can handle this thingkind of systematically.
627,00:26:29.20,00:26:29.20,Yeah.
628,00:26:33.97,00:26:33.97,"Right now, it's Ted."
629,00:26:35.50,00:26:35.50,Oh.
630,00:26:36.50,00:26:36.50,"Right now, it's...it's Ted to go first."
631,00:26:38.57,00:26:38.57,"Oh, yeah?"
632,00:26:39.93,00:26:39.93," JAKE: I'm just trying to salvage our team,"
633,00:26:41.53,00:26:41.53, trying to salvage me.
634,00:26:43.50,00:26:43.50,I'm trying to ooch my wayinto some spot
635,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,that might get meto the final four.
636,00:26:54.37,00:26:54.37,"TED:How you doing, Jeff?"
637,00:26:55.67,00:26:55.67,JAN (giggles):Hi.

640,00:27:00.40,00:27:00.40,"Ah, hate to give her up."
641,00:27:01.63,00:27:01.63,"Yep.Immunity is back up for grabs,"
642,00:27:03.83,00:27:03.83,"but because you guys are now onetribe, tribal immunity no more."

683,00:28:45.83,00:28:45.83,-That is also correct.-Yeah!
684,00:28:47.07,00:28:47.07,I knew it was.
685,00:28:48.43,00:28:48.43,"Penny, you need toget this right."
686,00:28:50.37,00:28:50.37,"Miss it, you're out."

689,00:28:56.50,00:28:56.50,This will determine who winsthe first individual immunity.
690,00:29:01.30,00:29:01.30," All right, this one's a little more complicated."
691,00:29:04.27,00:29:04.27, We have a series of sandy mounds laid out on a grid.
692,00:29:08.07,00:29:08.07, Buried inside those mounds are ten disks for each of you.
693,00:29:11.97,00:29:11.97,There are instructions on these disks that will navigate you
694,00:29:15.57,00:29:15.57," through the grid, from one buried disk to the next."
695,00:29:19.20,00:29:19.20,The first symbolrepresents a number.
696,00:29:21.43,00:29:21.43,This is the number ofsandy mounds you will travel.
697,00:29:24.60,00:29:24.60,"Second symbol is a direction--east, west, north, south."
698,00:29:28.53,00:29:28.53,This is the directionyou will travel in.
699,00:29:30.50,00:29:30.50," If you misread the instructions,"
700,00:29:32.80,00:29:32.80, you'll uncover a red disk.
701,00:29:34.33,00:29:34.33, That means you got to try again.
702,00:29:36.03,00:29:36.03," If you get it right, you'll uncover"
703,00:29:37.77,00:29:37.77," the next set of instructions,"
704,00:29:39.47,00:29:39.47, which will also have a tally card.
705,00:29:41.70,00:29:41.70," Tear off the tally card, hang it on your tally board."
706,00:29:45.37,00:29:45.37,First person with their tentally cards on their tally board
707,00:29:49.00,00:29:49.00,wins immunity--safe from the vote.
708,00:29:51.30,00:29:51.30,-Ready to run it?-Yep.
709,00:29:52.93,00:29:52.93,"Take a spot, wait for my go."
710,00:29:56.87,00:29:56.87, Compass right here; you can reference it anytime.
711,00:29:59.03,00:29:59.03," And always remember, the water is west."
712,00:30:01.83,00:30:01.83,"Here we go, guys, for immunity."
713,00:30:03.80,00:30:03.80,-Survivors ready?-Ready.
714,00:30:05.07,00:30:05.07,Go!

753,00:32:20.77,00:32:20.77,"Clay, safe fromthe vote tonight."
754,00:32:22.77,00:32:22.77,"At a one-in-eight game,very important."
755,00:32:26.03,00:32:26.03,"The other seven,everybody's vulnerable tonight."
756,00:32:27.63,00:32:27.63,You guys can head back to camp.
757,00:32:30.00,00:32:30.00,-I'll see you at Tribal.-Thank you.
758,00:32:43.57,00:32:43.57,"Good job, guys."
759,00:32:44.87,00:32:44.87,Y'all did a good job.
760,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,"-Congratulations, man.-Thank you, thank you."
761,00:32:47.83,00:32:47.83,-Congratulations. -I don't wantanybody to be jealous or
762,00:32:49.90,00:32:49.90,"anything, but I plan on keepingthis thing a long, long time."
763,00:32:52.47,00:32:52.47,"-That's fine, that's fine.-TED: It's all good, baby."
764,00:32:54.33,00:32:54.33,"Clay, you did good."
765,00:32:55.57,00:32:55.57,"-Thank you, sir.-You done good."
766,00:32:56.80,00:32:56.80,"Thank you, sir."
767,00:32:57.80,00:32:57.80,JAKE:You really did great.
768,00:32:59.30,00:32:59.30,"TED: Today, we had our first individual immunity challenge."
769,00:33:02.77,00:33:02.77, And the fact that NYC was in the finals
770,00:33:05.77,00:33:05.77, basically showed his strength today.
771,00:33:09.10,00:33:09.10,So our strategy now is tolet's go ahead and eliminate
772,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,the strength or the potentialstrength of Sook Jai.
773,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,They've been worried sincesquare one that I was a threat.
774,00:33:17.43,00:33:17.43,And they didn't want to have tocompete against me for immunity.
775,00:33:22.07,00:33:22.07,So I don't thinkthey're going to take Ted.
776,00:33:24.80,00:33:24.80,"It's not in their best interestto do that, and they know it."
777,00:33:27.13,00:33:27.13,So they're not going to.
778,00:33:28.40,00:33:28.40,We got to createa little bit of stir.
779,00:33:30.93,00:33:30.93,-Shake up the chicken coop?-We got to create...
780,00:33:32.47,00:33:32.47,We got to createsome doubt here.
781,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,"Basically, we got to bringone over, or we're screwed."
782,00:33:37.53,00:33:37.53,"Yeah. Now, who can youbring over?"
783,00:33:40.00,00:33:40.00,I think what I'm going to dois tell Clay he ain't got
784,00:33:42.60,00:33:42.60,a chance of winningagainst Brian.
785,00:33:45.43,00:33:45.43,(chuckles)
786,00:33:47.50,00:33:47.50,We ought to get rid of him.
787,00:33:49.10,00:33:49.10,JAKE: The plan is pretty simple.
788,00:33:50.53,00:33:50.53,"We get rid of Brian,and we get rid of Brian tonight."
789,00:33:57.10,00:33:57.10, Brian's a class act.
790,00:33:58.47,00:33:58.47, So the idea is to get rid of a real strong person.
791,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33," But the way we do it is, I use my team members--"
792,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40, there's three strong-- to vote for Brian.
793,00:34:09.43,00:34:09.43," And Clay brings in one other person with him,"
794,00:34:13.23,00:34:13.23,"and we vote Brian out,just that quick."
795,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,My plan calls for you to be ableto handle one of the ladies.
796,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,Can you handle one of them?
797,00:34:20.87,00:34:20.87,"-Oh, yeah.-Can you?"
798,00:34:21.87,00:34:21.87,"Oh, easy."
799,00:34:22.87,00:34:22.87,And then we-we canmove into the...
800,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,-Top two?-Mm-hmm.
801,00:34:26.30,00:34:26.30,It's-It's a pretty good planfor moving us there.
802,00:34:30.43,00:34:30.43,It's-It's a great plan for you.
803,00:34:32.07,00:34:32.07,Mm-hmm. I'll take anything--they trust me.
804,00:34:34.40,00:34:34.40,CLAY: Jake's trying to get me to work out a deal where
805,00:34:36.87,00:34:36.87, he's wanting me to kick Brian off
806,00:34:38.27,00:34:38.27, and he's got it all figured out.
807,00:34:39.67,00:34:39.67,We'll see what happens.
808,00:34:40.90,00:34:40.90,"Jake is out for Jake,and Clay's out for Clay."
809,00:34:43.43,00:34:43.43,"If we did that and votedBrian off, it be three."
810,00:34:46.63,00:34:46.63,That's what I'm thinking.
811,00:34:48.57,00:34:48.57,"I mean, that's in Clay'sbest interest,"
812,00:34:50.47,00:34:50.47,but he's not going tosee it like that.
813,00:34:52.27,00:34:52.27,I don't know.
814,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,"KEN: Jake has an alternative plan,"
815,00:34:55.67,00:34:55.67, trying to work a deal with Clay.
816,00:34:57.33,00:34:57.33,"It would actually bein Clay's best interest,"
817,00:34:58.77,00:34:58.77,but whether or not
818,00:35:00.33,00:35:00.33,Clay sees it like that is going to be a different story.
819,00:35:03.27,00:35:03.27,Have you heard anything?
820,00:35:04.77,00:35:04.77,No.
821,00:35:06.10,00:35:06.10,"I say just, uh, vote for Ted,like they said."
822,00:35:08.53,00:35:08.53,"They said they weregetting rid of him, so, uh,"
823,00:35:11.47,00:35:11.47,just vote for himand hope for the best.
824,00:35:13.27,00:35:13.27,That's all I can do.
825,00:35:14.90,00:35:14.90,KEN: Chuay Gahn is saying that they're going to vote Ted out.
826,00:35:17.13,00:35:17.13,"If that's the possibility,it might keep me afloat,"
827,00:35:19.23,00:35:19.23,I-I'll throw a throw a votethat way.
828,00:35:20.70,00:35:20.70,"God, I hate this cleavageleaking out"
829,00:35:23.30,00:35:23.30,"in front of everybody,but that's okay."
830,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,"-Really got us all turned on.-I know it, I know."
831,00:35:28.63,00:35:28.63,"BRIAN: Now it's the, uh, fourth quarter basically."
832,00:35:30.30,00:35:30.30, We're getting into the long stretch.
833,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47, Everything counts.
834,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17," Friends count, uh, relationships count."
835,00:35:37.37,00:35:37.37,"The littlest things are gonnaeither, uh, make you or break"
836,00:35:40.40,00:35:40.40," you in this stage,  so unless you're holding"
837,00:35:42.20,00:35:42.20," that immunity necklace around you, who knows?"
838,00:36:08.60,00:36:08.60,We'll now bring inthe first member of our jury.
839,00:36:15.13,00:36:15.13,Erin will attendall Tribal Councils.
840,00:36:16.97,00:36:16.97,She's here merely to observe.
841,00:36:18.87,00:36:18.87,"You're not toaddress her, either."
842,00:36:21.20,00:36:21.20,"Now with the additionof the jury,"
843,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,you're voting people out whoyou're then going to ask
844,00:36:26.20,00:36:26.20,to vote for youto win this thing.
845,00:36:28.20,00:36:28.20,"Politically, becomes very toughto navigate through this."
846,00:36:32.37,00:36:32.37,-Clay.-Yep?
847,00:36:34.37,00:36:34.37,"Now thatit's an individual game,"
848,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,how does it change how you look
849,00:36:37.47,00:36:37.47,"at the other seven members,in terms of threat?"
850,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,"Everybody's kind offiguring out,"
851,00:36:41.47,00:36:41.47,where do I stand in-in thistribe that we got now?
852,00:36:44.30,00:36:44.30,How strong am I of a competitor?What's...
853,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,"What's Penny's, uh, strongpoints or her weak points?"
854,00:36:50.33,00:36:50.33,Then you got to turn aroundand look at Ted--
855,00:36:52.23,00:36:52.23,what's his strong pointsand what his weak points are.
856,00:36:54.70,00:36:54.70,And you've got to tryto figure out
857,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,how I could fit in a-and beatthe both the big and the little.
858,00:37:02.07,00:37:02.07,And I'm not a real big guy.
859,00:37:03.73,00:37:03.73,"And so it, uh, it plays on you."
860,00:37:06.43,00:37:06.43,"Jake, do you think everybodyis exactly as they appear?"
861,00:37:09.97,00:37:09.97,"Well, I keep... I keep trying"
862,00:37:12.07,00:37:12.07,to focus on the way I'm playingthe game.
863,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,"And I keep trying to bejust who I am,"
864,00:37:16.87,00:37:16.87,as genuine as I possibly can be.
865,00:37:19.10,00:37:19.10,"But, you know, it's a game,"
866,00:37:21.63,00:37:21.63,"and it's filled with lies,and we just have to accept that"
867,00:37:24.23,00:37:24.23,and try to ferret out
868,00:37:26.83,00:37:26.83,"the ones that we thinkare doing it the most,"
869,00:37:29.70,00:37:29.70,get rid of them as quicklyas possible and go on.
870,00:37:33.57,00:37:33.57,"Big Ted, had any momentsat camp where you thought,"
871,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"""Eh, maybe I shouldn'thave said that;"
872,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"that might have come offthe wrong way""?"
873,00:37:39.23,00:37:39.23,I-I haven't done anythingthat I regret.
874,00:37:42.47,00:37:42.47,"However, there was a pointwhere I was feeling"
875,00:37:45.57,00:37:45.57,basically homesick.
876,00:37:47.13,00:37:47.13,"Um, I think that challengethat we had where I actually"
877,00:37:50.00,00:37:50.00,"got to see a picture of my baby,I thought that was"
878,00:37:52.17,00:37:52.17,going to havea positive impact with me.
879,00:37:54.10,00:37:54.10,"However, I felt real depressedand down and blue"
880,00:37:57.23,00:37:57.23,"because I couldn'thold my daughter,"
881,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,I couldn't playwith my daughter.
882,00:38:00.57,00:38:00.57,So the way I rectifiedthat situation is by taking
883,00:38:03.63,00:38:03.63,"some quality me time,"
884,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,"just basically, you know,clearing all that blueness,"
885,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,"which is going to get meto the end,"
886,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,as far as this game takes me.
887,00:38:12.10,00:38:12.10,"Penny, you starting to noticethings about people"
888,00:38:14.17,00:38:14.17,that you didn't noticethe first 26 days?
889,00:38:16.77,00:38:16.77,Not really.
890,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,"Um, I've just, you know,frankly enjoyed"
891,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,"the merge that we've had andI think it's been more relaxing,"
892,00:38:24.17,00:38:24.17,"myself, around camp,because now we can all take on"
893,00:38:27.93,00:38:27.93,the same excitement and the samejoy that we all have as a group.
894,00:38:31.73,00:38:31.73,"Brian, what's tonight's votegoing to be based on?"
895,00:38:35.07,00:38:35.07,"Past performances, um, uh...general working around camp--"
896,00:38:39.73,00:38:39.73,"those that, uh,work a little harder,"
897,00:38:41.80,00:38:41.80,"those that, uh,don't do as much."
898,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,"So probably, uh, production--"
899,00:38:45.73,00:38:45.73,"or lack of production,I should say."
900,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,PROBST:Okay. Clay.
901,00:38:48.90,00:38:48.90,"Yes, sir?"
902,00:38:50.20,00:38:50.20,"With that immunity necklacearound your throat,"
903,00:38:53.50,00:38:53.50,you are safefrom the vote tonight.
904,00:38:55.50,00:38:55.50,And doesn't it feel good.
905,00:38:56.87,00:38:56.87,"PROBST: That said,you cannot vote for Clay."
906,00:38:59.07,00:38:59.07,Everybody else is vulnerable.
907,00:39:00.57,00:39:00.57,It is time to vote.
908,00:39:01.77,00:39:01.77,"Helen, you're first."
909,00:39:15.00,00:39:15.00,"Hope to see you soon,and, uh, a great player."
910,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,I really didn't knowwho to vote.
911,00:39:42.53,00:39:42.53,I really have enjoyedmeeting you.
912,00:39:44.30,00:39:44.30,I've really enjoyed knowing you.
913,00:39:46.00,00:39:46.00,Bye.
914,00:40:14.77,00:40:14.77,"You're a neat guy,"
915,00:40:16.30,00:40:16.30,but you got to get rid ofthe strong for me to keep going.
916,00:40:22.87,00:40:22.87,I'll go tally the votes.
917,00:40:33.50,00:40:33.50,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
918,00:40:35.47,00:40:35.47,The person voted outwill be asked
919,00:40:36.93,00:40:36.93,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
920,00:40:38.70,00:40:38.70,I'll read the votes.
921,00:40:42.87,00:40:42.87,First vote...

932,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,Ken.
933,00:41:24.70,00:41:24.70,"That's four votes Ken,three votes Ted."
934,00:41:29.50,00:41:29.50,Last vote...
935,00:41:32.57,00:41:32.57,Ken.
936,00:41:34.57,00:41:34.57,Need to bring me your torch.
937,00:41:47.47,00:41:47.47,"Ken, the tribe has spoken."
938,00:41:52.33,00:41:52.33,It's time for you to go.
939,00:42:02.53,00:42:02.53,"Good luck, everyone."
940,00:42:10.23,00:42:10.23,Head back to camp.

944,00:42:34.60,00:42:34.60, Ted feels the sting of receiving three votes.
945,00:42:37.70,00:42:37.70,I got three votesfrom the members of Sook Jai.
946,00:42:40.57,00:42:40.57, CLAY: Ted didn't know we instigated those three votes
947,00:42:42.60,00:42:42.60,"for him, and, uh, and he won't."
948,00:42:44.20,00:42:44.20,PROBST: Someone gets a big reward.
949,00:42:47.17,00:42:47.17, You'll be treated to a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

951,00:42:51.10,00:42:51.10, come back with a belly full.
952,00:42:57.67,00:42:57.67,This is definitelya life-altering experience.

954,00:43:02.17,00:43:02.17,like you never have before.
955,00:43:03.63,00:43:03.63," Like bananas, like, that's such a life-giving,"
956,00:43:05.43,00:43:05.43," delicious, incredible thing."
957,00:43:07.83,00:43:07.83,"And if, uh, anybody feels sorry for me, you know,"
958,00:43:10.33,00:43:10.33," that I got kicked off, you know,"
959,00:43:11.87,00:43:11.87," chocolate chip cookies, ladies, they-- I love them."
