2,00:00:01.03,00:00:01.03,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.23,00:00:03.23, Chuay Gahn and Sook Jai  struggled
4,00:00:04.53,00:00:04.53, with living together  as separate tribes.
5,00:00:07.23,00:00:07.23,"BRIAN: When I look at Sook Jai,  I see enemy."
6,00:00:09.63,00:00:09.63," I can't just, all of a sudden,  ""Oh, great, one happy family."""
7,00:00:12.13,00:00:12.13,It's not gonna happen. They're gonna have to earn that.
8,00:00:13.80,00:00:13.80,KEN: There's definitely a strategic reason to get along
9,00:00:15.77,00:00:15.77," with these people, because"
10,00:00:17.27,00:00:17.27,things change real quick.
11,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57,PROBST:  The immunity challenge
12,00:00:20.07,00:00:20.07, became a showdown  between Brian and Jake.
13,00:00:23.17,00:00:23.17,The only way Sook Jai can win is if Jake
14,00:00:25.73,00:00:25.73,stays under the water longer than Brian.
15,00:00:28.17,00:00:28.17," But Jake gave up too soon,"
16,00:00:29.83,00:00:29.83, handing Chuay Gahn  their victory.
17,00:00:31.90,00:00:31.90,Chuay Gahn wins immunity.
18,00:00:33.37,00:00:33.37,(cheering)
19,00:00:35.10,00:00:35.10," Back at camp, there was an uneasy atmosphere,"
20,00:00:37.77,00:00:37.77, as the winners and losers  tried to coexist.
21,00:00:40.57,00:00:40.57,"TED: It's like we can't fully enjoy our win, because"
22,00:00:43.87,00:00:43.87,we kind of like you guys.
23,00:00:45.27,00:00:45.27,"CLAY: That's what we're  trying to tell them,"
24,00:00:47.13,00:00:47.13,"""Oh, we're so sorry y'all got to go"
25,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,"to Tribal Council and that,"" but we were so damn happy."
26,00:00:50.97,00:00:50.97,"PROBST:  Before Tribal Council,"
27,00:00:52.33,00:00:52.33, Sook Jai made  an emotional pact.
28,00:00:54.47,00:00:54.47,Do we want to go ahead and reveal who's going tonight?
29,00:00:58.57,00:00:58.57,I would only want to know if everybody's in agreement
30,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00,that that's what we're going to do.
31,00:01:02.40,00:01:02.40,"PENNY: Well, let's just save it for Tribal Council, then."
32,00:01:04.73,00:01:04.73,JAKE:  It's tough when you have to
33,00:01:06.30,00:01:06.30,vote somebody off that you love.
34,00:01:09.30,00:01:09.30,"PROBST: In a difficult decision,  the members of the tribe"
35,00:01:11.60,00:01:11.60, reluctantly said good-bye  to Erin.
36,00:01:15.17,00:01:15.17,First member of our jury: Erin.
37,00:01:18.13,00:01:18.13,The tribe has spoken.
38,00:01:21.53,00:01:21.53, Eight are left.
39,00:01:22.63,00:01:22.63, Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:02:35.57,00:02:35.57,TED: Everyone deserves what they're getting right now.
41,00:02:38.73,00:02:38.73,"-We deserve to be right here, -I know. Oh, no."
42,00:02:40.90,00:02:40.90,-boiling the soup. -No argument about that.
43,00:02:42.57,00:02:42.57,"While the other team is going to Tribal Council,"
44,00:02:44.23,00:02:44.23,because we worked our butt off
45,00:02:45.93,00:02:45.93,to get to where we are right now.
46,00:02:47.73,00:02:47.73,"TED: In the beginning, a lot of  people didn't predict this."
47,00:02:50.57,00:02:50.57, A lot of people  would never ever
48,00:02:52.10,00:02:52.10,have thought that Chuay Gahn would be
49,00:02:54.33,00:02:54.33,this powerful at this point.
50,00:02:55.73,00:02:55.73," Um, whether it's a merger  or a non-merger,"
51,00:02:58.23,00:02:58.23," Chuay Gahn is in  a very, very power position"
52,00:03:01.40,00:03:01.40, to do whatever we want.
53,00:03:03.00,00:03:03.00,BRIAN: We went through our down time.
54,00:03:04.57,00:03:04.57,"-JAN: Oh, absolutely. -So it's their turn."
55,00:03:06.77,00:03:06.77,You know?
56,00:03:07.90,00:03:07.90,-It's definitely their turn. -CLAY: Yeah.
57,00:03:09.37,00:03:09.37,JAN: Sook Jai left  to go to Tribal Council.
58,00:03:11.73,00:03:11.73, They had to vote someone off.
59,00:03:12.83,00:03:12.83," Of course then we tried  to guess who was going to go,"
60,00:03:15.63,00:03:15.63," and, uh, it was half and half."
61,00:03:17.73,00:03:17.73,We thought Erin and we thought Ken.
62,00:03:20.23,00:03:20.23,"TED: Penny, Penny."
63,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,Jeff just axed Penny.
64,00:03:24.03,00:03:24.03,"Who you gonna, uh-- How you voting tonight and why?"
65,00:03:27.00,00:03:27.00,Um...
66,00:03:28.00,00:03:28.00,"Is Penny voting, you guys?"
67,00:03:29.23,00:03:29.23,"Um, I think I'm going to have to go with..."
68,00:03:31.57,00:03:31.57,"JAN: Oh, dear leader, I don't know!"
69,00:03:34.43,00:03:34.43,(laughter)
70,00:03:35.60,00:03:35.60,"Oh, I don't know."
71,00:03:37.07,00:03:37.07,I think I'm going to have to stab my friend Erin in the back
72,00:03:39.70,00:03:39.70,-and take her out. -(laughter)
73,00:03:41.60,00:03:41.60,"TED: Okay, down at the end?"
74,00:03:43.40,00:03:43.40,"JAN: NYC, himself."
75,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,"Well, uh, uh..."
76,00:03:46.80,00:03:46.80,"-Yo! -Jeff, how's my hair look?"
77,00:03:48.10,00:03:48.10,(laughter)
78,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,"By the way, by the way, Jeff, by the way,"
79,00:03:51.30,00:03:51.30,"I just want to make sure everyone knows,"
80,00:03:52.73,00:03:52.73,"I am a New York police officer, one of its finest,"
81,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,"-and, uh, damned if you won't... -And I don't want the women"
82,00:03:57.77,00:03:57.77,-to know that. -You won't... won't believe that
83,00:03:59.43,00:03:59.43,"the, uh, uh-- when you put on a uniform,"
84,00:04:01.33,00:04:01.33,you get all kinds of bitches.
85,00:04:02.70,00:04:02.70,(laughter)
86,00:04:04.10,00:04:04.10,"Yo, yo, yo, yo."
87,00:04:05.70,00:04:05.70,JAN:  We did feel sorry for them
88,00:04:07.37,00:04:07.37," having to lose someone,  but we were"
89,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,glad it was them and not us. (laughs)
90,00:04:11.40,00:04:11.40,You think that's them?
91,00:04:13.57,00:04:13.57,"Wow, you suppose they're back already?"
92,00:04:17.20,00:04:17.20,PENNY: It was really hard  to come back
93,00:04:18.97,00:04:18.97," after, uh, we voted Erin out,"
94,00:04:20.97,00:04:20.97,"because now we were down to three people,"
95,00:04:22.97,00:04:22.97,and Chuay Gahn has five.
96,00:04:24.40,00:04:24.40,JAKE: It's a tough game.
97,00:04:26.17,00:04:26.17,KEN: Sure is.
98,00:04:27.17,00:04:27.17,PENNY: I love you guys. Let's stay tight.
99,00:04:28.93,00:04:28.93,"-I love you, too. -You, too."
100,00:04:30.43,00:04:30.43,-Stay tight. -That's it-- hang tough.
101,00:04:32.43,00:04:32.43,JAKE: We're still  two separate tribes.
102,00:04:34.93,00:04:34.93," We need to be able to win  an immunity challenge,"
103,00:04:37.43,00:04:37.43, and we need to get  a plan together
104,00:04:39.63,00:04:39.63,and figure out how we can get ahead on the vote somehow.
105,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63, We've got to fight for  everything we're going to get.
106,00:04:47.33,00:04:47.33,-JAN: They're walking in. -HELEN: Here they are.
107,00:04:48.80,00:04:48.80,TED: Your questions shall be answered in a short second.
108,00:04:52.47,00:04:52.47,Survey says?
109,00:04:54.07,00:04:54.07,"JAKE: Guys, we're back, minus one."
110,00:04:58.43,00:04:58.43,CLAY: Who'd we lose?
111,00:04:59.77,00:04:59.77,PENNY: We lost Erin.
112,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,BRIAN: Oh.
113,00:05:02.73,00:05:02.73,-How was the Council? -JAKE: Sucked.
114,00:05:04.23,00:05:04.23,We don't want to go back.
115,00:05:06.63,00:05:06.63,CLAY: How did Erin take it?
116,00:05:08.60,00:05:08.60,JAKE: She took it hard.
117,00:05:10.83,00:05:10.83,So did we.
118,00:05:12.17,00:05:12.17,PENNY: Thanks for waiting up.
119,00:05:13.60,00:05:13.60,CLAY: You bet.
120,00:05:14.87,00:05:14.87,I'm sorry y'all have to experience this with us.
121,00:05:17.23,00:05:17.23,JAKE: Yeah.
122,00:05:18.43,00:05:18.43,"That's all right, that's all right."
123,00:05:20.17,00:05:20.17,"Thank you, guys, for mourning with us."
124,00:05:22.87,00:05:22.87,KEN: Thank you.
125,00:05:23.87,00:05:23.87,BRIAN: Y'all tired?
126,00:05:25.13,00:05:25.13,"Uh, I don't know whether I'm tired or depressed."
127,00:05:27.97,00:05:27.97,That really takes it out of you.
128,00:05:29.20,00:05:29.20,Losing somebody that's been with you
129,00:05:31.20,00:05:31.20,for as long as she's been with us.
130,00:05:32.93,00:05:32.93,PENNY: Hardest thing I've had to do.
131,00:05:34.93,00:05:34.93,She's been my sleeping partner for the past 24 days.
132,00:05:37.27,00:05:37.27,JAN: Yep.
133,00:05:38.70,00:05:38.70,"Yeah, she was like a sister to me; she still is."
134,00:05:41.37,00:05:41.37,JAN: It's hard.
135,00:05:56.53,00:05:56.53,"JAKE: Man, what an interesting  time we're having now."
136,00:06:01.07,00:06:01.07, I think what everybody  on both sides
137,00:06:02.97,00:06:02.97, is trying to do is  put their best foot forward
138,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87, and just kind of see  what's going to happen next.
139,00:06:09.33,00:06:09.33, So I've got to figure out
140,00:06:10.87,00:06:10.87,how I can best fit in.
141,00:06:13.00,00:06:13.00,Y'all want to hear about the first time
142,00:06:14.33,00:06:14.33,I ever shot with a bow and arrow?
143,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,-TED AND JAN: Yeah. -It's a hysterical story.
144,00:06:18.00,00:06:18.00,"First I heard this squirrel just barking,"
145,00:06:19.73,00:06:19.73,just chattering up a storm.
146,00:06:21.20,00:06:21.20,"I said, well, I wonder what he's looking at,"
147,00:06:23.13,00:06:23.13,"so I started sneaking over to where he was,"
148,00:06:24.93,00:06:24.93,and I looked up there and there was a little six-point buck.
149,00:06:27.57,00:06:27.57,TED: What Jake has been doing  a lot is that he'll sit around
150,00:06:30.77,00:06:30.77, and start telling  some of the adventures
151,00:06:32.93,00:06:32.93," that he's been on, as if"
152,00:06:34.70,00:06:34.70,we're going to be overly wowed by that.
153,00:06:37.60,00:06:37.60,"JAKE: Well, here I am standing there with a bow and arrow"
154,00:06:39.73,00:06:39.73,and my heart starts... (imitates loud heartbeat)
155,00:06:43.47,00:06:43.47,And darn if he didn't start walking toward me.
156,00:06:46.40,00:06:46.40,JAKE: I guess what I'm trying  to do by sharing stories
157,00:06:49.90,00:06:49.90," is to say, guys,"
158,00:06:51.27,00:06:51.27,"I'm an adventurer just like you,"
159,00:06:52.83,00:06:52.83,I just happen to be an old adventurer.
160,00:06:54.87,00:06:54.87,"All of a sudden, he looked up at me, just straight at me"
161,00:06:58.40,00:06:58.40,and I had the prettiest open chest and neck shot
162,00:07:02.27,00:07:02.27,that you've ever seen in your life.
163,00:07:04.33,00:07:04.33,(clicks tongue)
164,00:07:05.60,00:07:05.60,"I let go of that arrow, hit him right square in the ass."
165,00:07:09.40,00:07:09.40,(laughter)
166,00:07:11.23,00:07:11.23,Everybody in the group are sick of his Roy Roger tales.
167,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00,"Then all of a sudden, I hear this, ""Open your parachute!"
168,00:07:18.50,00:07:18.50,"Grab your rip cord!"""
169,00:07:20.23,00:07:20.23,And I drifted right over an airport runway.
170,00:07:22.23,00:07:22.23,"BRIAN: Oh, my gosh."
171,00:07:24.13,00:07:24.13,And I hit that ground and just--
172,00:07:26.67,00:07:26.67,My ankle went ka-bap!
173,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,-Just snapped it. -Just snapped it.
174,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,"TED: Well, I don't know  a lot about parachuting,"
175,00:07:33.40,00:07:33.40, but that was a little  far-fetched for me.
176,00:07:35.10,00:07:35.10," I mean, and in the middle  of an airport?"
177,00:07:37.07,00:07:37.07,"Uh, I would imagine that's some type of FAA violation."
178,00:07:41.27,00:07:41.27,"I've had both my ankles broken twice, see."
179,00:07:44.00,00:07:44.00,"One time football, one time skydiving,"
180,00:07:46.33,00:07:46.33,one time motorcycle accident and one time skiing.
181,00:07:49.70,00:07:49.70,CLAY: Jake thinks he's being  smooth and conniving.
182,00:07:52.17,00:07:52.17," He's just trying to get us  sucked in like,"
183,00:07:54.03,00:07:54.03," ""Hey, I'm just a good old"
184,00:07:55.27,00:07:55.27,"""mountain man that goes out and kills them elk"

188,00:08:07.03,00:08:07.03,"If he thinks we're biting that, he's crazy."
189,00:08:10.33,00:08:10.33,(laughter)
190,00:08:21.07,00:08:21.07,"Y'all, you can see the clouds up there,"
191,00:08:24.13,00:08:24.13,that moon's so bright.
192,00:08:26.30,00:08:26.30,"Hey, does anybody miss their family?"
193,00:08:28.20,00:08:28.20,"HELEN: Oh, hell, yeah."
194,00:08:29.33,00:08:29.33,"I miss my family every, every day."
195,00:08:30.77,00:08:30.77,"HELEN: Yeah, me, too."
196,00:08:31.97,00:08:31.97,"Son, this the hardest thing I've ever done."
197,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,HELEN: I agree.
198,00:08:34.17,00:08:34.17,"TED: It's hard, but..."
199,00:08:36.23,00:08:36.23,"Yeah, my son is 23 and he said, ""Dad,"" he said, ""those nights"

432,00:18:22.13,00:18:22.13,Go!
433,00:18:28.87,00:18:28.87,Clay and Ken make quick work.
434,00:18:31.33,00:18:31.33,Brian and Helen are right behind.
435,00:18:37.77,00:18:37.77,Helen is working that fishnet.
436,00:18:39.73,00:18:39.73,Brian and Helen moving on to the cargo net.

439,00:18:52.83,00:18:52.83,Here's how it works.
440,00:18:53.87,00:18:53.87,There are 20 wicker balls.
441,00:18:55.43,00:18:55.43, They're made up into seven  pieces that make up a pyramid.
442,00:18:59.10,00:18:59.10,Your goal: use those wicker balls
443,00:19:01.27,00:19:01.27,to replicate the pyramid in front of you.
444,00:19:03.67,00:19:03.67,Survivors ready?
445,00:19:05.40,00:19:05.40,Go!
446,00:19:06.77,00:19:06.77,"PENNY: Come on, guys."
447,00:19:07.90,00:19:07.90,"-Let's go, let's go. -Go."
448,00:19:41.83,00:19:41.83,PROBST: Brian's got it!
449,00:19:44.23,00:19:44.23,-Good job. -Ready for something to drink?
450,00:19:45.93,00:19:45.93,-Good job! -Watch a little video?
451,00:19:49.40,00:19:49.40,"Let's go, everybody."
452,00:19:50.93,00:19:50.93,Take a look at Brian's video.
453,00:19:52.03,00:19:52.03,"-Right on. -Let's head out, guys."
454,00:19:53.17,00:19:53.17,Let's go.
455,00:19:54.17,00:19:54.17,"Great, Brian!"
456,00:19:55.47,00:19:55.47,"Good job, Bri!"
457,00:19:56.47,00:19:56.47,-Brian. -Thank you.
458,00:19:57.80,00:19:57.80,"You can have the honor, since it is your reward."
459,00:19:59.87,00:19:59.87,"One glass, one pitcher."
460,00:20:01.40,00:20:01.40,"You got it.  Salud, everybody."
461,00:20:03.37,00:20:03.37, -Salud. -I'm gonna... I'm gonna pass it around.
462,00:20:05.60,00:20:05.60,"While you guys drink, got your name on it."
463,00:20:09.07,00:20:09.07,Oh. Hey.
464,00:20:10.93,00:20:10.93,"If my wife does anything embarrassing, I apologize."
465,00:20:12.67,00:20:12.67,She's a little crazy. (chuckles)
466,00:20:15.70,00:20:15.70,"Hey, honey! Congratulations."
467,00:20:17.63,00:20:17.63,"I guess you won... whatever,"
468,00:20:20.40,00:20:20.40,because you're watching this tape.
469,00:20:21.77,00:20:21.77,"Say hey, Logan."
470,00:20:22.83,00:20:22.83,"""Hey, Daddy!"""
471,00:20:24.20,00:20:24.20,Say hello. Boop-boop. Look at the camera.
472,00:20:26.87,00:20:26.87,"Say, ""Hello, Daddy!"""
473,00:20:27.87,00:20:27.87,I miss you. I love you.
474,00:20:29.93,00:20:29.93,"Also, I've been getting in shape."
475,00:20:32.37,00:20:32.37,"Look at those muscles, yeah!"
476,00:20:34.80,00:20:34.80,"(chuckles) Logey and I, we're going to party."
477,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,"Now that you're gone, we're going to party."
478,00:20:38.30,00:20:38.30,"See, I told you. What'd I tell y'all?"
479,00:20:39.67,00:20:39.67,So Logey and I are going to go downstairs
480,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,and we're going to go dance.
481,00:20:42.63,00:20:42.63,(music playing)
482,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,"Logan's like, ""What the..."""
483,00:20:45.30,00:20:45.30,"He's like, ""What's Mommy doing?"""
484,00:20:48.43,00:20:48.43,"HELEN: He's liking it, though."
485,00:20:49.77,00:20:49.77,"BRIAN: Oh, my gosh, that's too funny."
486,00:20:51.87,00:20:51.87,"CLAY: She's a fox,  I'm going to tell you."
487,00:20:54.47,00:20:54.47," She's a fine-looking woman,  and, uh..."
488,00:20:57.00,00:20:57.00,"Buddy, she's-she's fit for the bikinis, I'm going to tell you."
489,00:20:59.90,00:20:59.90,BRIAN: Sorry if she gets a little crazy here.
490,00:21:02.17,00:21:02.17,(laughs) That's okay.
491,00:21:04.37,00:21:04.37,"BRIAN: She kept her clothes on,  which I was happy about,"
492,00:21:06.37,00:21:06.37,"but, uh, I didn't want everyone"
493,00:21:07.80,00:21:07.80,to know more about me than they should.
494,00:21:09.40,00:21:09.40,"It's almost one of those things where, uh,"
495,00:21:11.70,00:21:11.70,I didn't think it was necessary  for them to see my family.
496,00:21:13.53,00:21:13.53,The house is a real mess.
497,00:21:16.20,00:21:16.20,"-Why don't you clean up? -I'll show it to you, anyway."
498,00:21:18.17,00:21:18.17,"Is this kind of weird, seeing your house?"
499,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,"Yeah, it's really weird."
500,00:21:21.40,00:21:21.40,And here's your lovely piano that we miss you playing.
501,00:21:25.80,00:21:25.80,(playing discordant notes)
502,00:21:29.37,00:21:29.37,There's the beater.
503,00:21:31.10,00:21:31.10,There's your car.
504,00:21:33.10,00:21:33.10,"The Caddy, Caddy, Caddy."
505,00:21:35.33,00:21:35.33,HELEN: With the nice  two brand-new cars
506,00:21:37.03,00:21:37.03," in the garage  and the baby grand piano,"
507,00:21:39.93,00:21:39.93,it looks like Brian's doing pretty damn good for himself.
508,00:21:43.33,00:21:43.33," If I were against Brian  right now,"
509,00:21:45.03,00:21:45.03," that'd be enough to vote him  off, because I'd be going,"
510,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50," ""This guy doesn't  need the money."""
511,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,"We want you to come home soon, and we want you to win"
512,00:21:52.37,00:21:52.37,the million dollars so that we can all go to Fiji.
513,00:21:56.50,00:21:56.50,Love you.
514,00:21:58.63,00:21:58.63,Bye. (smooching)
515,00:22:11.23,00:22:11.23,"JAN: ""Chuay Jai."""
516,00:22:12.77,00:22:12.77,"Underneath that, ""Survivor 5."""
517,00:22:14.70,00:22:14.70,Then the rest of the goal is going to have each person
518,00:22:17.57,00:22:17.57,with their hand on the top and the bottom.
519,00:22:19.60,00:22:19.60,"That'd be real neat, to put all of our handprints."
520,00:22:22.17,00:22:22.17,"CLAY:  We had a little challenge,"
521,00:22:23.57,00:22:23.57," and, uh, found out  we was all one tribe."
522,00:22:26.00,00:22:26.00," And now is when  the game's gonna start,"
523,00:22:27.30,00:22:27.30,'cause I'm gonna tell you what.
524,00:22:28.50,00:22:28.50,"Hell, I'm here to win a million dollars."
525,00:22:30.33,00:22:30.33,"To outplay, outwit and outlast."
526,00:22:32.20,00:22:32.20,-KEN: Clay. -Huh?
527,00:22:33.63,00:22:33.63,-You said you wanted to put our handprints on it? -Yeah.
528,00:22:35.57,00:22:35.57,"JAN: Oh, that's great."
529,00:22:37.93,00:22:37.93,That looks great.
530,00:22:40.13,00:22:40.13,My main concern was getting to this point to where now we have
531,00:22:42.63,00:22:42.63,"individual challenges, and it could help me."
532,00:22:44.70,00:22:44.70,I'm going to be a viable threat  for that immunity
533,00:22:48.10,00:22:48.10, every time it comes around.
534,00:22:49.60,00:22:49.60,-TED: Oh. -Got it.
535,00:22:50.93,00:22:50.93,-Good deal. -That is good.
536,00:22:52.40,00:22:52.40,"Okay, who's next?"
537,00:22:54.07,00:22:54.07,"BRIAN:  We've now come to a merger,"
538,00:22:55.60,00:22:55.60," which is a crossroads,  and it's a new game."
539,00:22:58.37,00:22:58.37,You've got two former enemies that are now sleeping together.
540,00:23:03.13,00:23:03.13,But right now it doesn't matter
541,00:23:04.70,00:23:04.70,whether it was somebody from my tribe
542,00:23:06.40,00:23:06.40,or somebody from the other tribe.
543,00:23:07.90,00:23:07.90," Whoever's getting on  someone's nerves,"
544,00:23:10.13,00:23:10.13, that's pretty much  how the vote's going to go.
545,00:23:12.13,00:23:12.13,PENNY: You know what? That refried bean dip
546,00:23:14.20,00:23:14.20,"with cream cheese, there's sour cream in there, too."
547,00:23:16.47,00:23:16.47,"-HELEN: There... Okay, I was wondering. -I forgot."
548,00:23:17.83,00:23:17.83,"'Cause it was sounding really thick to me, but... -Yeah."
549,00:23:19.53,00:23:19.53,-I thought about that last night. -Okay.
550,00:23:22.47,00:23:22.47,"TED: Helen would be talking  about recipes and food,"
551,00:23:25.80,00:23:25.80," and those things were  really, really, really"
552,00:23:27.60,00:23:27.60, starting to bother me.
553,00:23:29.73,00:23:29.73,"KEN: Are you sleeping, Ted?"
554,00:23:31.30,00:23:31.30,"Just, uh, resting the eyes."
555,00:23:34.13,00:23:34.13," TED: I felt myself,  little small things"
556,00:23:36.20,00:23:36.20,starting to get on my nerve.
557,00:23:38.20,00:23:38.20," You know, I was feeling"
558,00:23:39.40,00:23:39.40, grumpier and grumpier  and grumpier.
559,00:23:41.80,00:23:41.80,"So, wh-what do you put-- what's in that sauce, to flavor yours?"
560,00:23:44.43,00:23:44.43,"JAN: It's got Worcester, soy sauce..."
561,00:23:46.43,00:23:46.43,"TED: I internalized all of that,  and I said, um, it's time."
562,00:23:49.73,00:23:49.73, It's time for me to get away  and to get some me time.
563,00:23:59.37,00:23:59.37, It was some real good  quality me time.
564,00:24:03.10,00:24:03.10,I think the reason why a lot of people don't take the me time
565,00:24:06.77,00:24:06.77, is because  they don't want to be
566,00:24:08.43,00:24:08.43,perceived as a loner or
567,00:24:11.57,00:24:11.57," somebody out there,  not a part of the team,"
568,00:24:14.40,00:24:14.40, that type of thing.
569,00:24:15.77,00:24:15.77, I honestly am taking a risk  by doing that.
570,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,Ted just went off on the canoe.
571,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,He didn't tell anyone.
572,00:24:26.10,00:24:26.10,He probably didn't mean to go out that far.
573,00:24:29.07,00:24:29.07,"Probably just needed to get away, you know."
574,00:24:30.93,00:24:30.93,PENNY:  I think Ted kind of
575,00:24:32.73,00:24:32.73," goes off and does  his own thing sometimes,"
576,00:24:35.13,00:24:35.13, and sometimes I don't think  he fits in with the group
577,00:24:38.27,00:24:38.27,maybe as well as he may think that he does.
578,00:24:41.47,00:24:41.47,"Ted is not that fast, I mean..."
579,00:24:42.83,00:24:42.83,No.
580,00:24:44.17,00:24:44.17,-He can't swim at all. -He can't swim worth--
581,00:24:45.83,00:24:45.83,He's not-- he's too big to run.
582,00:24:47.13,00:24:47.13,Mm-hmm.
583,00:24:48.27,00:24:48.27,CLAY: As long as I just don't--  just kind of leave
584,00:24:51.27,00:24:51.27,"-him alone, he's not gonna piss me off. -You gotta be real..."
585,00:24:53.70,00:24:53.70,-It's his way or the highway. -Ted doesn't like...
586,00:24:55.13,00:24:55.13,"Ted doesn't, you know-- he ain't got a clue."
587,00:24:57.77,00:24:57.77,BRIAN:  It's just amazing how out here
588,00:24:59.57,00:24:59.57,"the littlest things tick people off or get under someone's skin,"
589,00:25:03.40,00:25:03.40," which is so interesting to me,  how such a small, minute thing"
590,00:25:05.90,00:25:05.90, out here can really escalate
591,00:25:07.10,00:25:07.10,"into a, uh, bigger problem down the road."
592,00:25:09.67,00:25:09.67,We're just trying to get him-- we got to get him on the jury.
593,00:25:11.87,00:25:11.87,That'll secure me and you
594,00:25:13.50,00:25:13.50,-immunity all the way in. -Okay.
595,00:25:15.33,00:25:15.33,"Okay, you got it."
596,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,"BRIAN: With regards to  my alliance with Ted,"
597,00:25:18.20,00:25:18.20," I think that once it does  get down to either him or me,"
598,00:25:21.17,00:25:21.17,obviously I'm going to be
599,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,looking after good old number one.
600,00:25:23.57,00:25:23.57,I-I think if we just play it a little bit cool
601,00:25:25.83,00:25:25.83,"and just march right on in there,"
602,00:25:28.10,00:25:28.10,that would secure us all the way to the top two.
603,00:25:30.37,00:25:30.37,"Okay, yeah."
604,00:25:31.77,00:25:31.77,(sighs)
605,00:25:38.30,00:25:38.30,JAKE: I'm right in the midst  of trying to find
606,00:25:40.50,00:25:40.50, somebody that will get on  my team from the other side.
607,00:25:43.60,00:25:43.60,And I don't know who I can trust on the other team.
608,00:25:45.63,00:25:45.63,That's the problem.
609,00:25:47.10,00:25:47.10,"Ted-- everybody's tired of Ted, getting tired of Ted, so..."
610,00:25:50.50,00:25:50.50,"They like him, they love him to death,"
611,00:25:52.23,00:25:52.23,"but just his attitude is, uh, getting pretty old."
612,00:25:56.47,00:25:56.47,"So, in your estimation,"
613,00:25:57.90,00:25:57.90,that's probably who you'd go for first?
614,00:26:00.07,00:26:00.07,"If it was right now, yeah."
615,00:26:02.03,00:26:02.03,"JAKE: From Clay,  I got a sense that they're all"
616,00:26:04.47,00:26:04.47, really tired of Ted today.
617,00:26:06.23,00:26:06.23,He said that's probably who they'd vote off
618,00:26:08.03,00:26:08.03,if they had to vote today.
619,00:26:09.80,00:26:09.80,"At first, I would've definitely said, uh, Ken,"
620,00:26:12.53,00:26:12.53,"but then everybody telling you, ""He's a pretty good ol' guy."
621,00:26:14.63,00:26:14.63,"He's a pretty good ol' guy."""
622,00:26:15.93,00:26:15.93,"JAKE:  Clay said, uh, we were"
623,00:26:18.10,00:26:18.10, ready to vote Ken out.
624,00:26:19.67,00:26:19.67, Now it's very likely  going to be Ted.
625,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,"You know, if we can get some kind of an alliance"
626,00:26:24.60,00:26:24.60,"cooking right now, we can..."
627,00:26:26.77,00:26:26.77,we can handle this thing kind of systematically.
628,00:26:29.20,00:26:29.20,Yeah.
629,00:26:33.97,00:26:33.97,"Right now, it's Ted."
630,00:26:35.50,00:26:35.50,Oh.
631,00:26:36.50,00:26:36.50,"Right now, it's... it's Ted to go first."
632,00:26:38.57,00:26:38.57,"Oh, yeah?"
633,00:26:39.93,00:26:39.93," JAKE: I'm just trying  to salvage our team,"
634,00:26:41.53,00:26:41.53, trying to salvage me.
635,00:26:43.50,00:26:43.50,I'm trying to ooch my way into some spot
636,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,that might get me to the final four.
637,00:26:54.37,00:26:54.37,"TED: How you doing, Jeff?"
638,00:26:55.67,00:26:55.67,JAN (giggles): Hi.
639,00:26:57.83,00:26:57.83,"PROBST: Welcome, guys."
640,00:26:59.03,00:26:59.03,First things first.
641,00:27:00.40,00:27:00.40,"Ah, hate to give her up."
642,00:27:01.63,00:27:01.63,"Yep. Immunity is back up for grabs,"
643,00:27:03.83,00:27:03.83,"but because you guys are now one tribe, tribal immunity no more."
644,00:27:08.00,00:27:08.00,Mm-hmm.
645,00:27:08.97,00:27:08.97,This is what you now covet.
646,00:27:11.73,00:27:11.73,The immunity necklace.
647,00:27:12.77,00:27:12.77,"Wear this, you cannot be voted out."
648,00:27:16.67,00:27:16.67,Today's challenge will be played in two rounds.
649,00:27:19.83,00:27:19.83,The first is a simple elimination round
650,00:27:21.87,00:27:21.87,that will test your memory.
651,00:27:23.93,00:27:23.93,The second round will be a final
652,00:27:25.73,00:27:25.73, showdown race  on the course behind me.
653,00:27:28.40,00:27:28.40,"For the first round, I will show you a grid."
654,00:27:30.33,00:27:30.33,On the grid will be the numbers one through nine in English
655,00:27:33.43,00:27:33.43,and the numbers one through nine in Thai.
656,00:27:35.80,00:27:35.80,I'll give you 30 seconds
657,00:27:37.37,00:27:37.37,to study the grid and memorize the Thai numbers.
658,00:27:41.07,00:27:41.07,Miss one number and you're out of the game.
659,00:27:44.13,00:27:44.13,Take a seat. Grab the colored cards
660,00:27:45.97,00:27:45.97,that have the Thai numbers on them.
661,00:27:47.97,00:27:47.97,"I'm going to say a number in English,"
662,00:27:49.53,00:27:49.53,you show me that same number in Thai.
663,00:27:54.03,00:27:54.03,"All right, look closely."
664,00:27:56.03,00:27:56.03,You got 30 seconds to memorize these.
665,00:28:04.50,00:28:04.50,All right.
666,00:28:05.60,00:28:05.60,"Grab your stack, stand up."
667,00:28:07.43,00:28:07.43,Show me the number nine.
668,00:28:12.60,00:28:12.60,"Ken, you're right."
669,00:28:14.37,00:28:14.37,"Jake, you're not."
670,00:28:15.97,00:28:15.97,Have a seat.
671,00:28:17.67,00:28:17.67,"Clay, you're right."
672,00:28:18.77,00:28:18.77,"Helen, you're not."
673,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,Have a seat.
674,00:28:21.20,00:28:21.20,"Penny, you're right."
675,00:28:22.83,00:28:22.83,"Jan, you're wrong. Have a seat."
676,00:28:24.43,00:28:24.43,"Ted, that is not right."
677,00:28:26.47,00:28:26.47,Have a seat.
678,00:28:27.63,00:28:27.63,"Brian, that is not right."
679,00:28:28.77,00:28:28.77,Have a seat.
680,00:28:29.77,00:28:29.77,We're down to three.
681,00:28:31.63,00:28:31.63,Only two of you will move to the next round.
682,00:28:34.57,00:28:34.57,Show me the number one.
683,00:28:43.20,00:28:43.20,That is correct.
684,00:28:45.83,00:28:45.83,-That is also correct. -Yeah!
685,00:28:47.07,00:28:47.07,I knew it was.
686,00:28:48.43,00:28:48.43,"Penny, you need to get this right."
687,00:28:50.37,00:28:50.37,"Miss it, you're out."
688,00:28:52.73,00:28:52.73,That is wrong.
689,00:28:54.07,00:28:54.07,Clay and Ken moving on to the final round.
690,00:28:56.50,00:28:56.50,This will determine who wins the first individual immunity.
691,00:29:01.30,00:29:01.30," All right, this one's  a little more complicated."
692,00:29:04.27,00:29:04.27, We have a series of sandy  mounds laid out on a grid.
693,00:29:08.07,00:29:08.07, Buried inside those mounds  are ten disks for each of you.
694,00:29:11.97,00:29:11.97,There are instructions on these  disks that will navigate you
695,00:29:15.57,00:29:15.57," through the grid, from  one buried disk to the next."
696,00:29:19.20,00:29:19.20,The first symbol represents a number.
697,00:29:21.43,00:29:21.43,This is the number of sandy mounds you will travel.
698,00:29:24.60,00:29:24.60,"Second symbol is a direction-- east, west, north, south."
699,00:29:28.53,00:29:28.53,This is the direction you will travel in.
700,00:29:30.50,00:29:30.50," If you misread  the instructions,"
701,00:29:32.80,00:29:32.80, you'll uncover a red disk.
702,00:29:34.33,00:29:34.33, That means  you got to try again.
703,00:29:36.03,00:29:36.03," If you get it right,  you'll uncover"
704,00:29:37.77,00:29:37.77," the next set of instructions,"
705,00:29:39.47,00:29:39.47, which will also have  a tally card.
706,00:29:41.70,00:29:41.70," Tear off the tally card,  hang it on your tally board."
707,00:29:45.37,00:29:45.37,First person with their ten tally cards on their tally board
708,00:29:49.00,00:29:49.00,wins immunity-- safe from the vote.
709,00:29:51.30,00:29:51.30,-Ready to run it? -Yep.
710,00:29:52.93,00:29:52.93,"Take a spot, wait for my go."
711,00:29:56.87,00:29:56.87, Compass right here;  you can reference it anytime.
712,00:29:59.03,00:29:59.03," And always remember,  the water is west."
713,00:30:01.83,00:30:01.83,"Here we go, guys, for immunity."
714,00:30:03.80,00:30:03.80,-Survivors ready? -Ready.
715,00:30:05.07,00:30:05.07,Go!
716,00:30:06.07,00:30:06.07,"JAN: Go, guys!"
717,00:30:20.77,00:30:20.77,"One, two."
718,00:30:24.10,00:30:24.10,East.
719,00:30:25.73,00:30:25.73,"One, two."
720,00:30:29.80,00:30:29.80,(whispers): Two...
721,00:30:37.17,00:30:37.17,PROBST: Clay found his first one.
722,00:30:39.07,00:30:39.07,JAN: Good job.
723,00:30:42.77,00:30:42.77,"PROBST: No, Ken, try again."
724,00:30:51.97,00:30:51.97,Clay has his second one.
725,00:30:53.07,00:30:53.07,"JAN: Way to go, Clay!"
726,00:31:02.40,00:31:02.40,"(mutters): Okay, one."
727,00:31:04.57,00:31:04.57,East.
728,00:31:09.97,00:31:09.97,PROBST: Clay has his third disk.
729,00:31:13.57,00:31:13.57,Ken has his first one.
730,00:31:14.67,00:31:14.67,"JAN: Way to go, Ken!"
731,00:31:15.67,00:31:15.67,"Good job, Ken."
732,00:31:21.00,00:31:21.00,PROBST: Clay has his fourth disk.
733,00:31:24.40,00:31:24.40,Clay has his fifth disk.
734,00:31:29.47,00:31:29.47,Clay has his sixth disk.
735,00:31:30.80,00:31:30.80,Ken has his second.
736,00:31:32.40,00:31:32.40,Clay has his seventh disk.
737,00:31:35.70,00:31:35.70,Clay has seven.
738,00:31:37.60,00:31:37.60,Ken has two.
739,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,"Ken, wrong again."
740,00:31:48.47,00:31:48.47,Clay has his ninth disk.
741,00:31:53.77,00:31:53.77,Ken has his third disk.
742,00:31:55.87,00:31:55.87,"One more, Clay, and you win immunity."
743,00:31:57.40,00:31:57.40,Clay has his tenth disk!
744,00:32:00.63,00:32:00.63,-Yeah! Yeah! -(onlookers cheering)
745,00:32:02.97,00:32:02.97,"-JAN: Way to go, Clay! Yay! -Yeah!"
746,00:32:07.97,00:32:07.97,-Clay wins immunity! -Yeah! -(cheering)
747,00:32:09.63,00:32:09.63,Yeah!
748,00:32:10.53,00:32:10.53,Congratulations.
749,00:32:12.10,00:32:12.10,Thank you.
750,00:32:13.37,00:32:13.37,"-Way to go, Clay! -PROBST: Get over here, Clay."
751,00:32:15.23,00:32:15.23,"I know I look sexy, baby!"
752,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,I know I look sexy!
753,00:32:19.33,00:32:19.33,"-Pretty good! -It's me, baby."
754,00:32:20.77,00:32:20.77,"Clay, safe from the vote tonight."
755,00:32:22.77,00:32:22.77,"At a one-in-eight game, very important."
756,00:32:26.03,00:32:26.03,"The other seven, everybody's vulnerable tonight."
757,00:32:27.63,00:32:27.63,You guys can head back to camp.
758,00:32:30.00,00:32:30.00,-I'll see you at Tribal. -Thank you.
759,00:32:43.57,00:32:43.57,"Good job, guys."
760,00:32:44.87,00:32:44.87,Y'all did a good job.
761,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,"-Congratulations, man. -Thank you, thank you."
762,00:32:47.83,00:32:47.83,-Congratulations. -I don't want anybody to be jealous or
763,00:32:49.90,00:32:49.90,"anything, but I plan on keeping this thing a long, long time."
764,00:32:52.47,00:32:52.47,"-That's fine, that's fine. -TED: It's all good, baby."
765,00:32:54.33,00:32:54.33,"Clay, you did good."
766,00:32:55.57,00:32:55.57,"-Thank you, sir. -You done good."
767,00:32:56.80,00:32:56.80,"Thank you, sir."
768,00:32:57.80,00:32:57.80,JAKE: You really did great.
769,00:32:59.30,00:32:59.30,"TED: Today, we had our first  individual immunity challenge."
770,00:33:02.77,00:33:02.77, And the fact that  NYC was in the finals
771,00:33:05.77,00:33:05.77, basically showed  his strength today.
772,00:33:09.10,00:33:09.10,So our strategy now is to let's go ahead and eliminate
773,00:33:11.70,00:33:11.70,the strength or the potential strength of Sook Jai.
774,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,They've been worried since square one that I was a threat.
775,00:33:17.43,00:33:17.43,And they didn't want to have to compete against me for immunity.
776,00:33:22.07,00:33:22.07,So I don't think they're going to take Ted.
777,00:33:24.80,00:33:24.80,"It's not in their best interest to do that, and they know it."
778,00:33:27.13,00:33:27.13,So they're not going to.
779,00:33:28.40,00:33:28.40,We got to create a little bit of stir.
780,00:33:30.93,00:33:30.93,-Shake up the chicken coop? -We got to create...
781,00:33:32.47,00:33:32.47,We got to create some doubt here.
782,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,"Basically, we got to bring one over, or we're screwed."
783,00:33:37.53,00:33:37.53,"Yeah. Now, who can you bring over?"
784,00:33:40.00,00:33:40.00,I think what I'm going to do is tell Clay he ain't got
785,00:33:42.60,00:33:42.60,a chance of winning against Brian.
786,00:33:45.43,00:33:45.43,(chuckles)
787,00:33:47.50,00:33:47.50,We ought to get rid of him.
788,00:33:49.10,00:33:49.10,JAKE:  The plan is pretty simple.
789,00:33:50.53,00:33:50.53,"We get rid of Brian, and we get rid of Brian tonight."
790,00:33:57.10,00:33:57.10, Brian's a class act.
791,00:33:58.47,00:33:58.47, So the idea is to get rid of  a real strong person.
792,00:34:02.33,00:34:02.33," But the way we do it  is, I use my team members--"
793,00:34:05.40,00:34:05.40, there's three strong--  to vote for Brian.
794,00:34:09.43,00:34:09.43," And Clay brings in  one other person with him,"
795,00:34:13.23,00:34:13.23,"and we vote Brian out, just that quick."
796,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,My plan calls for you to be able to handle one of the ladies.
797,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,Can you handle one of them?
798,00:34:20.87,00:34:20.87,"-Oh, yeah. -Can you?"
799,00:34:21.87,00:34:21.87,"Oh, easy."
800,00:34:22.87,00:34:22.87,And then we-we can move into the...
801,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,-Top two? -Mm-hmm.
802,00:34:26.30,00:34:26.30,It's-It's a pretty good plan for moving us there.
803,00:34:30.43,00:34:30.43,It's-It's a great plan for you.
804,00:34:32.07,00:34:32.07,Mm-hmm. I'll take anything-- they trust me.
805,00:34:34.40,00:34:34.40,CLAY: Jake's trying to get me  to work out a deal where
806,00:34:36.87,00:34:36.87, he's wanting me  to kick Brian off
807,00:34:38.27,00:34:38.27, and he's got it  all figured out.
808,00:34:39.67,00:34:39.67,We'll see what happens.
809,00:34:40.90,00:34:40.90,"Jake is out for Jake, and Clay's out for Clay."
810,00:34:43.43,00:34:43.43,"If we did that and voted Brian off, it be three."
811,00:34:46.63,00:34:46.63,That's what I'm thinking.
812,00:34:48.57,00:34:48.57,"I mean, that's in Clay's best interest,"
813,00:34:50.47,00:34:50.47,but he's not going to see it like that.
814,00:34:52.27,00:34:52.27,I don't know.
815,00:34:53.67,00:34:53.67,"KEN: Jake has  an alternative plan,"
816,00:34:55.67,00:34:55.67, trying to work  a deal with Clay.
817,00:34:57.33,00:34:57.33,"It would actually be in Clay's best interest,"
818,00:34:58.77,00:34:58.77,but whether or not
819,00:35:00.33,00:35:00.33,Clay sees it like that is going  to be a different story.
820,00:35:03.27,00:35:03.27,Have you heard anything?
821,00:35:04.77,00:35:04.77,No.
822,00:35:06.10,00:35:06.10,"I say just, uh, vote for Ted, like they said."
823,00:35:08.53,00:35:08.53,"They said they were getting rid of him, so, uh,"
824,00:35:11.47,00:35:11.47,just vote for him and hope for the best.
825,00:35:13.27,00:35:13.27,That's all I can do.
826,00:35:14.90,00:35:14.90,KEN: Chuay Gahn is saying that  they're going to vote Ted out.
827,00:35:17.13,00:35:17.13,"If that's the possibility, it might keep me afloat,"
828,00:35:19.23,00:35:19.23,I-I'll throw a throw a vote that way.
829,00:35:20.70,00:35:20.70,"God, I hate this cleavage leaking out"
830,00:35:23.30,00:35:23.30,"in front of everybody, but that's okay."
831,00:35:25.50,00:35:25.50,"-Really got us all turned on. -I know it, I know."
832,00:35:28.63,00:35:28.63,"BRIAN: Now it's the, uh,  fourth quarter basically."
833,00:35:30.30,00:35:30.30, We're getting into  the long stretch.
834,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47, Everything counts.
835,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17," Friends count, uh,  relationships count."
836,00:35:37.37,00:35:37.37,"The littlest things are gonna either, uh, make you or break"
837,00:35:40.40,00:35:40.40," you in this stage,   so unless you're holding"
838,00:35:42.20,00:35:42.20," that immunity necklace  around you, who knows?"
839,00:36:08.60,00:36:08.60,We'll now bring in the first member of our jury.
840,00:36:15.13,00:36:15.13,Erin will attend all Tribal Councils.
841,00:36:16.97,00:36:16.97,She's here merely to observe.
842,00:36:18.87,00:36:18.87,"You're not to address her, either."
843,00:36:21.20,00:36:21.20,"Now with the addition of the jury,"
844,00:36:23.83,00:36:23.83,you're voting people out who you're then going to ask
845,00:36:26.20,00:36:26.20,to vote for you to win this thing.
846,00:36:28.20,00:36:28.20,"Politically, becomes very tough to navigate through this."
847,00:36:32.37,00:36:32.37,-Clay. -Yep?
848,00:36:34.37,00:36:34.37,"Now that it's an individual game,"
849,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,how does it change how you look
850,00:36:37.47,00:36:37.47,"at the other seven members, in terms of threat?"
851,00:36:39.83,00:36:39.83,"Everybody's kind of figuring out,"
852,00:36:41.47,00:36:41.47,where do I stand in-in this tribe that we got now?
853,00:36:44.30,00:36:44.30,How strong am I of a competitor? What's...
854,00:36:47.00,00:36:47.00,"What's Penny's, uh, strong points or her weak points?"
855,00:36:50.33,00:36:50.33,Then you got to turn around and look at Ted--
856,00:36:52.23,00:36:52.23,what's his strong points and what his weak points are.
857,00:36:54.70,00:36:54.70,And you've got to try to figure out
858,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,how I could fit in a-and beat the both the big and the little.
859,00:37:02.07,00:37:02.07,And I'm not a real big guy.
860,00:37:03.73,00:37:03.73,"And so it, uh, it plays on you."
861,00:37:06.43,00:37:06.43,"Jake, do you think everybody is exactly as they appear?"
862,00:37:09.97,00:37:09.97,"Well, I keep... I keep trying"
863,00:37:12.07,00:37:12.07,to focus on the way I'm playing the game.
864,00:37:14.40,00:37:14.40,"And I keep trying to be just who I am,"
865,00:37:16.87,00:37:16.87,as genuine as I possibly can be.
866,00:37:19.10,00:37:19.10,"But, you know, it's a game,"
867,00:37:21.63,00:37:21.63,"and it's filled with lies, and we just have to accept that"
868,00:37:24.23,00:37:24.23,and try to ferret out
869,00:37:26.83,00:37:26.83,"the ones that we think are doing it the most,"
870,00:37:29.70,00:37:29.70,get rid of them as quickly as possible and go on.
871,00:37:33.57,00:37:33.57,"Big Ted, had any moments at camp where you thought,"
872,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"""Eh, maybe I shouldn't have said that;"
873,00:37:37.83,00:37:37.83,"that might have come off the wrong way""?"
874,00:37:39.23,00:37:39.23,I-I haven't done anything that I regret.
875,00:37:42.47,00:37:42.47,"However, there was a point where I was feeling"
876,00:37:45.57,00:37:45.57,basically homesick.
877,00:37:47.13,00:37:47.13,"Um, I think that challenge that we had where I actually"
878,00:37:50.00,00:37:50.00,"got to see a picture of my baby, I thought that was"
879,00:37:52.17,00:37:52.17,going to have a positive impact with me.
880,00:37:54.10,00:37:54.10,"However, I felt real depressed and down and blue"
881,00:37:57.23,00:37:57.23,"because I couldn't hold my daughter,"
882,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,I couldn't play with my daughter.
883,00:38:00.57,00:38:00.57,So the way I rectified that situation is by taking
884,00:38:03.63,00:38:03.63,"some quality me time,"
885,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,"just basically, you know, clearing all that blueness,"
886,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,"which is going to get me to the end,"
887,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,as far as this game takes me.
888,00:38:12.10,00:38:12.10,"Penny, you starting to notice things about people"
889,00:38:14.17,00:38:14.17,that you didn't notice the first 26 days?
890,00:38:16.77,00:38:16.77,Not really.
891,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,"Um, I've just, you know, frankly enjoyed"
892,00:38:21.00,00:38:21.00,"the merge that we've had and I think it's been more relaxing,"
893,00:38:24.17,00:38:24.17,"myself, around camp, because now we can all take on"
894,00:38:27.93,00:38:27.93,the same excitement and the same joy that we all have as a group.
895,00:38:31.73,00:38:31.73,"Brian, what's tonight's vote going to be based on?"
896,00:38:35.07,00:38:35.07,"Past performances, um, uh... general working around camp--"
897,00:38:39.73,00:38:39.73,"those that, uh, work a little harder,"
898,00:38:41.80,00:38:41.80,"those that, uh, don't do as much."
899,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,"So probably, uh, production--"
900,00:38:45.73,00:38:45.73,"or lack of production, I should say."
901,00:38:47.90,00:38:47.90,PROBST: Okay. Clay.
902,00:38:48.90,00:38:48.90,"Yes, sir?"
903,00:38:50.20,00:38:50.20,"With that immunity necklace around your throat,"
904,00:38:53.50,00:38:53.50,you are safe from the vote tonight.
905,00:38:55.50,00:38:55.50,And doesn't it feel good.
906,00:38:56.87,00:38:56.87,"PROBST: That said, you cannot vote for Clay."
907,00:38:59.07,00:38:59.07,Everybody else is vulnerable.
908,00:39:00.57,00:39:00.57,It is time to vote.
909,00:39:01.77,00:39:01.77,"Helen, you're first."
910,00:39:15.00,00:39:15.00,"Hope to see you soon, and, uh, a great player."
911,00:39:40.50,00:39:40.50,I really didn't know who to vote.
912,00:39:42.53,00:39:42.53,I really have enjoyed meeting you.
913,00:39:44.30,00:39:44.30,I've really enjoyed knowing you.
914,00:39:46.00,00:39:46.00,Bye.
915,00:40:14.77,00:40:14.77,"You're a neat guy,"
916,00:40:16.30,00:40:16.30,but you got to get rid of the strong for me to keep going.
917,00:40:22.87,00:40:22.87,I'll go tally the votes.
918,00:40:33.50,00:40:33.50,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
919,00:40:35.47,00:40:35.47,The person voted out will be asked
920,00:40:36.93,00:40:36.93,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
921,00:40:38.70,00:40:38.70,I'll read the votes.
922,00:40:42.87,00:40:42.87,First vote...
923,00:40:47.07,00:40:47.07,Ted.
924,00:40:52.13,00:40:52.13,Ted.
925,00:40:58.30,00:40:58.30,Ted.
926,00:40:59.30,00:40:59.30,"That's three votes, Ted."
927,00:41:03.30,00:41:03.30,Ken.
928,00:41:09.10,00:41:09.10,Ken.
929,00:41:10.47,00:41:10.47,That's two votes Ken.
930,00:41:15.20,00:41:15.20,Ken.
931,00:41:16.40,00:41:16.40,We're tied at three votes.
932,00:41:22.07,00:41:22.07,NYC.
933,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,Ken.
934,00:41:24.70,00:41:24.70,"That's four votes Ken, three votes Ted."
935,00:41:29.50,00:41:29.50,Last vote...
936,00:41:32.57,00:41:32.57,Ken.
937,00:41:34.57,00:41:34.57,Need to bring me your torch.
938,00:41:47.47,00:41:47.47,"Ken, the tribe has spoken."
939,00:41:52.33,00:41:52.33,It's time for you to go.
940,00:42:02.53,00:42:02.53,"Good luck, everyone."
941,00:42:10.23,00:42:10.23,Head back to camp.
942,00:42:11.93,00:42:11.93,Good night.
943,00:42:26.47,00:42:26.47,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
944,00:42:32.67,00:42:32.67,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
945,00:42:34.60,00:42:34.60, Ted feels the sting  of receiving three votes.
946,00:42:37.70,00:42:37.70,I got three votes from the members of Sook Jai.
947,00:42:40.57,00:42:40.57, CLAY: Ted didn't know we  instigated those three votes
948,00:42:42.60,00:42:42.60,"for him, and, uh, and he won't."
949,00:42:44.20,00:42:44.20,PROBST:  Someone gets a big reward.
950,00:42:47.17,00:42:47.17, You'll be treated to a  once-in-a-lifetime experience.
951,00:42:48.63,00:42:48.63," It's a chance  to get away from camp,"
952,00:42:51.10,00:42:51.10, come back with a belly full.
953,00:42:57.67,00:42:57.67,This is definitely a life-altering experience.
954,00:43:00.23,00:43:00.23,"Um, you learn how to appreciate things"
955,00:43:02.17,00:43:02.17,like you never have before.
956,00:43:03.63,00:43:03.63," Like bananas, like,  that's such a life-giving,"
957,00:43:05.43,00:43:05.43," delicious, incredible thing."
958,00:43:07.83,00:43:07.83,"And if, uh, anybody feels sorry  for me, you know,"
959,00:43:10.33,00:43:10.33," that I got kicked off,  you know,"
960,00:43:11.87,00:43:11.87," chocolate chip cookies,  ladies, they-- I love them."
961,00:43:14.03,00:43:14.03, It's my favorite sweet thing.
962,00:43:15.37,00:43:15.37,"Anyway, I'll see you all soon."
963,00:43:16.70,00:43:16.70,Bye-bye.
