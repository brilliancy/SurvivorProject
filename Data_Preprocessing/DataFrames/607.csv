2,00:00:01.37,00:00:01.37,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.50,00:00:03.50, Tambaqui returned from Tribal Council vowing to unite.
4,00:00:06.77,00:00:06.77,We have to go forward as a new team.
5,00:00:09.20,00:00:09.20,"PROBST:  And at Jaburu,"
6,00:00:10.47,00:00:10.47, Shawna blossomed  in the company of men...
7,00:00:12.13,00:00:12.13,The guys saved me from the women.
8,00:00:15.27,00:00:15.27,PROBST:  ...especially Alex.
9,00:00:16.77,00:00:16.77,"Okay, you know, Shawna, that I'm not gonna ever tell you to stop."
10,00:00:19.07,00:00:19.07,SHAWNA: I want to get  to know him better.
11,00:00:20.13,00:00:20.13,He is an incredible person.
12,00:00:21.97,00:00:21.97,"-Go. -PROBST: Led by Christy,"
13,00:00:23.60,00:00:23.60, Tambaqui rolled to victory  at the reward challenge.
14,00:00:27.23,00:00:27.23,-Tambaqui! -Tambaqui!
15,00:00:29.53,00:00:29.53," At Jaburu, Rob and Deena  formed an alliance of two."
16,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,"DEENA: Rob approached me and  he said, ""I need some help."""
17,00:00:36.30,00:00:36.30,"And I said, ""Listen, I need some help."""
18,00:00:39.80,00:00:39.80,PROBST:  Tambaqui was victorious
19,00:00:41.30,00:00:41.30, for a second straight  challenge.
20,00:00:42.97,00:00:42.97,Tambaqui wins immunity!
21,00:00:44.70,00:00:44.70," So Jaburu  went to Tribal Council,"
22,00:00:46.60,00:00:46.60, where Alex looked on as  Shawna became the sixth person
23,00:00:49.77,00:00:49.77, voted out of the Amazon.
24,00:00:53.43,00:00:53.43, Ten are left.
25,00:00:54.70,00:00:54.70, Who will be voted out tonight?
26,00:02:02.83,00:02:02.83,(footsteps approaching)
27,00:02:07.70,00:02:07.70,"Don't step on the fire, everyone."
28,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,What's that?
29,00:02:10.67,00:02:10.67,Don't step on the fire.
30,00:02:12.57,00:02:12.57,DEENA: Tribal Council  tonight was awful.
31,00:02:14.73,00:02:14.73, Shawna is gone.
32,00:02:16.37,00:02:16.37,Somebody's gonna have to do fire shift by themselves.
33,00:02:18.27,00:02:18.27," You know, we miss"
34,00:02:19.40,00:02:19.40,"that extra little spark,"
35,00:02:21.13,00:02:21.13,the extra little bandana with the sunglasses.
36,00:02:23.73,00:02:23.73,I hate Tribal Council.
37,00:02:26.23,00:02:26.23,"I feel physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted."
38,00:02:30.20,00:02:30.20,"ROB:  Alex, I think, is a little bit"
39,00:02:32.70,00:02:32.70,depressed that Shawna is not here anymore.
40,00:02:35.27,00:02:35.27," And I'll be honest,  it's not the same"
41,00:02:37.33,00:02:37.33," not having another, uh,"
42,00:02:38.93,00:02:38.93," 23-year-old girl  in a bikini around, but"
43,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17,maybe he'll get his head out of his ass and start thinking
44,00:02:44.43,00:02:44.43,"about the game again, like he should be."
45,00:02:45.77,00:02:45.77,"As a team, do you guys think it's a good idea for"
46,00:02:49.27,00:02:49.27,the three guys-- should we have a merger-- to go back
47,00:02:52.43,00:02:52.43,"to the other three guys and say that, that we kept their plan"
48,00:02:55.17,00:02:55.17,"all along and kept all the guys together,"
49,00:02:57.93,00:02:57.93,and that's why Shawna got voted out?
50,00:03:00.87,00:03:00.87,But then you're just gonna pick us girls off.
51,00:03:02.33,00:03:02.33,"No, but we're not really gonna do that."
52,00:03:04.13,00:03:04.13,We're just gonna tell them.
53,00:03:05.40,00:03:05.40,Then you guys can also get the two girls to vote.
54,00:03:09.67,00:03:09.67,"See, Heidi, I have confidence in; Christy, I do not."
55,00:03:12.03,00:03:12.03,"You guys would have to get Heidi, then we'd be able"
56,00:03:15.40,00:03:15.40,to split up their vote and we could knock off Dave.
57,00:03:18.23,00:03:18.23,Mm-hmm.
58,00:03:19.23,00:03:19.23,This is just our insurance
59,00:03:20.97,00:03:20.97,to make sure it's not gonna be a five-five tie.
60,00:03:22.80,00:03:22.80,"It's kind of, uh, deceptive, though, and it's only a sug--"
61,00:03:24.77,00:03:24.77,it's only a suggestion.
62,00:03:26.47,00:03:26.47,ROB:  I don't like having to
63,00:03:27.73,00:03:27.73," discuss strategy  in an open forum,"
64,00:03:29.90,00:03:29.90," but should there be a merger  in the next three days,"
65,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,I just wanted to make sure that
66,00:03:34.00,00:03:34.00,all these knuckleheads understand the plan.
67,00:03:36.07,00:03:36.07,"Alex, are you comfortable with that?"
68,00:03:37.43,00:03:37.43,Absolutely.
69,00:03:38.47,00:03:38.47,This is my thinking.
70,00:03:40.63,00:03:40.63,Dave is probably the physically strongest out of everyone.
71,00:03:44.80,00:03:44.80,"I'm concerned that, what-what if it never...?"
72,00:03:47.10,00:03:47.10,"If we give him the opportunity to win immunity,"
73,00:03:49.10,00:03:49.10,-he'll take it. -Yes. Yes.
74,00:03:50.57,00:03:50.57,That's fine with me.
75,00:03:51.80,00:03:51.80,"If we can pinch Dave,"
76,00:03:53.40,00:03:53.40,then the whole house of cards is gonna crumble.
77,00:03:55.80,00:03:55.80,-Yep. -Mm-hmm.
78,00:03:56.80,00:03:56.80," Once we have that majority,"
79,00:03:58.00,00:03:58.00,"it's-- ""Roger, shut up."
80,00:04:01.20,00:04:01.20,"""Shut up, Roger."
81,00:04:02.27,00:04:02.27,"Stop talking, Roger."""
82,00:04:03.67,00:04:03.67," And finally, the shoe  will be on the other foot."
83,00:04:07.00,00:04:07.00,And it's gonna feel really good.
84,00:04:08.03,00:04:08.03,-Yes. -Mm-hmm.
85,00:04:09.27,00:04:09.27,That's gonna be a highlight of my game.
86,00:04:21.67,00:04:21.67,(chittering)
87,00:04:29.30,00:04:29.30,Welcome. You have treemail.
88,00:04:32.07,00:04:32.07,You have made my experience here so much more enjoyable.
89,00:04:35.00,00:04:35.00,"Hopefully, I'll be here all week."
90,00:04:37.10,00:04:37.10,"Okay, I opened it last time. You go."
91,00:04:41.20,00:04:41.20,-Here it is. -The key! The key!
92,00:04:43.10,00:04:43.10,Go!
93,00:04:44.57,00:04:44.57,-Go! -Go!
94,00:04:45.80,00:04:45.80,It says...
95,00:04:46.80,00:04:46.80,(shouting excitedly)
96,00:04:48.60,00:04:48.60," DEENA: Now, mind you,  there's been this box"
97,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43, inside of our supplies
98,00:04:52.23,00:04:52.23,since day one.
99,00:04:54.07,00:04:54.07,And it drives everybody nuts.
100,00:04:55.30,00:04:55.30,"You know, you shake it, you throw it, you drop it,"
101,00:04:57.43,00:04:57.43,you want to know what's inside.
102,00:04:58.60,00:04:58.60,BUTCH:  We were all excited
103,00:05:00.07,00:05:00.07, because we got to open
104,00:05:01.50,00:05:01.50,the box.
105,00:05:02.73,00:05:02.73,(humming fanfare)
106,00:05:04.60,00:05:04.60, We speculated for 18 days  what was in there.
107,00:05:07.13,00:05:07.13,Huh.
108,00:05:08.57,00:05:08.57,"Boy, isn't that great."
109,00:05:09.93,00:05:09.93,"""You started men and women, then mixed it up for fun,"
110,00:05:14.13,00:05:14.13,"For those who survive 19 days, it's time to live as one..."""
111,00:05:20.27,00:05:20.27,"""Paddle to your new location, leave your old life behind,"
112,00:05:22.93,00:05:22.93,"""Take your water, machete and personal pack"
113,00:05:25.30,00:05:25.30,"In the brand-new world you're about to find."""
114,00:05:27.37,00:05:27.37,"-Oh, we gotta build a new shelter? -Yeah."
115,00:05:29.37,00:05:29.37,-That sucks. -Hey.
116,00:05:30.63,00:05:30.63,"-Pack 'em up, kids. -Whatever!"
117,00:05:32.43,00:05:32.43,DEENA:  The note clearly says:
118,00:05:34.10,00:05:34.10,"""Now you should become one,"" and we're off."
119,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,It's over.
120,00:05:38.93,00:05:38.93,It is a merger.
121,00:05:40.93,00:05:40.93,-Anybody kind of nervous? -Yes.
122,00:05:42.83,00:05:42.83,But you know what? We're here.
123,00:05:44.30,00:05:44.30,"We're down with Jaburu, right?"
124,00:05:45.80,00:05:45.80,"-Hell, yes. -We're here."
125,00:05:47.07,00:05:47.07,"Yeah, you guys have really..."
126,00:05:48.23,00:05:48.23,"Dave, Roger, Butch."
127,00:05:50.13,00:05:50.13,"Amen to that, sister."
128,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,And don't ever let them see
129,00:05:53.83,00:05:53.83,"the five of us talking at one, at one time."
130,00:05:56.10,00:05:56.10,-I agree. -They'll suspect something's up.
131,00:05:57.20,00:05:57.20,-Okay. -Is everybody okay with that?
132,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,"We're all okay, okay with that, right?"
133,00:05:59.73,00:05:59.73,-Absolutely. -Stick to it.
134,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93,All for one.
135,00:06:02.17,00:06:02.17,ALL: One for all.
136,00:06:03.37,00:06:03.37,"Jenna, thanks for bringing us all together."
137,00:06:04.63,00:06:04.63,"Oh, no problem."
138,00:06:05.93,00:06:05.93,Word up.
139,00:06:07.10,00:06:07.10,-Peace out. -Okay.
140,00:06:08.10,00:06:08.10,"Good-bye, camp."
141,00:06:15.87,00:06:15.87,"Bye, home."
142,00:06:17.63,00:06:17.63,"-Bye, home. -Bye-bye. -Bye."
143,00:06:18.63,00:06:18.63,"It was a good time,"
144,00:06:19.63,00:06:19.63,"neat place, good friendship."
145,00:06:22.10,00:06:22.10,"I'll never forget it, long as I live."
146,00:06:24.53,00:06:24.53,Bye-bye.
147,00:06:25.63,00:06:25.63,Here we go.
148,00:06:44.83,00:06:44.83,"Come on in, guys!"
149,00:06:47.07,00:06:47.07,"Right up nice and tight, right in here."
150,00:06:53.63,00:06:53.63,Make sure you get all your stuff.
151,00:06:55.47,00:06:55.47,You're not coming back to these boats.
152,00:07:04.27,00:07:04.27,"Okay, as you guys know from your treemail today,"
153,00:07:07.57,00:07:07.57,the tribes of Jaburu and Tambaqui will merge into one.
154,00:07:12.30,00:07:12.30,You started this as a tribe of women and a tribe of men.
155,00:07:16.37,00:07:16.37,You then integrated into two new tribes.
156,00:07:18.13,00:07:18.13,"Today, you will form one final tribe and you will live"
157,00:07:21.50,00:07:21.50,with this tribe for the rest of your days in the Amazon.
158,00:07:25.10,00:07:25.10,The game also changes at this point.
159,00:07:27.07,00:07:27.07,It is now an individual game.
160,00:07:28.53,00:07:28.53,All challenges are individual--
161,00:07:30.43,00:07:30.43,"individual reward, individual immunity."
162,00:07:33.73,00:07:33.73,You can can take off your buffs and drop them.
163,00:07:36.43,00:07:36.43,Jaburu and Tambaqui are no more.
164,00:07:38.27,00:07:38.27,New buffs.
165,00:07:40.00,00:07:40.00,New tribe color.
166,00:07:42.63,00:07:42.63,You will also have a new home.
167,00:07:44.67,00:07:44.67,"That means, once again,"
168,00:07:46.23,00:07:46.23,you're gonna have to craft a new shelter.
169,00:07:47.90,00:07:47.90,"When you arrive at your new home, you must also come up with"
170,00:07:50.13,00:07:50.13,a new tribe name and paint your new tribe flag.
171,00:07:53.97,00:07:53.97,This is a map to your new home.
172,00:07:55.60,00:07:55.60,Everything you need will be waiting for you
173,00:07:57.47,00:07:57.47,at your new camp.
174,00:07:58.77,00:07:58.77,You have a boat to assist you in your journey.
175,00:08:02.77,00:08:02.77,I wish you good luck for your final days.
176,00:08:05.27,00:08:05.27,Let's head out. As you guys are heading
177,00:08:07.27,00:08:07.27,"to your boat, you can say your hellos"
178,00:08:08.87,00:08:08.87,and all that stuff from back on.
179,00:08:10.40,00:08:10.40,Feels like I've known you from day one.
180,00:08:12.40,00:08:12.40,I saw you the first time...
181,00:08:13.57,00:08:13.57,"Hi, I'm Rob."
182,00:08:15.10,00:08:15.10,(all chattering)
183,00:08:16.27,00:08:16.27,CHRISTY:  I'm so happy.
184,00:08:19.57,00:08:19.57,I made it to the merger.
185,00:08:21.10,00:08:21.10,I j-- I... Wow.
186,00:08:23.07,00:08:23.07,"Oh, nice to meet you."
187,00:08:25.20,00:08:25.20,"DAVE: The surge of, we've been battling one another"
188,00:08:28.97,00:08:28.97,and-and trying not to be eliminated
189,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,and trying to get to this point of the game
190,00:08:32.20,00:08:32.20," and we've-we've succeeded,  it's fantastic."
191,00:08:34.47,00:08:34.47, We're here right now.
192,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,It's done.
193,00:08:58.47,00:08:58.47,-Oh! -Whoo!
194,00:08:59.73,00:08:59.73,"ROGER: We arrive here  and, lo and behold,"
195,00:09:02.10,00:09:02.10," when we get off the boat,  there is a feast"
196,00:09:05.57,00:09:05.57,to end all feasts laid out for us.
197,00:09:07.33,00:09:07.33,Is there chocolate?
198,00:09:08.23,00:09:08.23,Look at that-- salsa!
199,00:09:10.13,00:09:10.13,It's chocolate cookies!
200,00:09:10.93,00:09:10.93,"Oh, my God!"
201,00:09:12.10,00:09:12.10,There are burgers!
202,00:09:13.10,00:09:13.10,I'm betting...
203,00:09:14.10,00:09:14.10,"Wait, wait. What's in here?"
204,00:09:15.97,00:09:15.97,"-(cheering, shouting) -Hot dogs!"
205,00:09:22.20,00:09:22.20,(excited chattering)
206,00:09:24.87,00:09:24.87,Potato salad.
207,00:09:25.90,00:09:25.90,"Here's some, uh, slaw."
208,00:09:28.33,00:09:28.33,Oh...
209,00:09:29.53,00:09:29.53,Give me a burger.
210,00:09:30.93,00:09:30.93,Burger right here.
211,00:09:32.20,00:09:32.20,(excited chattering)
212,00:09:34.03,00:09:34.03,Here you go!
213,00:09:35.50,00:09:35.50,DAVE:  We're at a new point.
214,00:09:36.73,00:09:36.73, It's new people.
215,00:09:38.43,00:09:38.43,It's new friendships to be made.
216,00:09:39.73,00:09:39.73,And it's just-- it was just
217,00:09:41.03,00:09:41.03, a flurry of excitement.
218,00:09:42.80,00:09:42.80," Nobody's thinking about who's  going off next, at that point."
219,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10," They're thinking,  we are blessed"
220,00:09:46.70,00:09:46.70, to have this meal right now.
221,00:09:48.67,00:09:48.67,Let's celebrate.
222,00:09:49.53,00:09:49.53,-Yeah! -Who wants a beer?
223,00:09:50.77,00:09:50.77,(cheering)
224,00:09:52.37,00:09:52.37,"Hey, here's to the new tribe and here's to new friends."
225,00:09:54.10,00:09:54.10,Yay!
226,00:09:56.23,00:09:56.23,-Cheers. -Cheers to you all.
227,00:09:58.10,00:09:58.10,"Congratulations, final ten."
228,00:10:04.03,00:10:04.03,"-Let's take it slow and really enjoy it, guys. -You know it. "
229,00:10:06.20,00:10:06.20,So what about our name?
230,00:10:07.70,00:10:07.70,We have some ideas for a new tribe name.
231,00:10:10.33,00:10:10.33,-Jacar\xc3\xa9. -Jacar\xc3\xa9.
232,00:10:11.60,00:10:11.60,"Which is Portuguese for ""alligator."""
233,00:10:12.90,00:10:12.90,"For ""caiman."" Alligator."
234,00:10:13.97,00:10:13.97,"-And ""crocodile."" -That's not bad."
235,00:10:15.13,00:10:15.13,I have no other suggestion.
236,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,-I'm fine. -A tribe is born.
237,00:10:17.23,00:10:17.23,-Jacar\xc3\xa9. -Jacar\xc3\xa9. -Jacar\xc3\xa9. -Jacar\xc3\xa9.
238,00:10:19.40,00:10:19.40,"Good salsa, too."
239,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,"-I don't want to get up. -I don't want to get up, either."
240,00:10:25.13,00:10:25.13,"I'm eating chips, man."
241,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13,Hand me a dog.
242,00:10:27.23,00:10:27.23,What has he been saying?
243,00:10:28.43,00:10:28.43,"Ah, we'll talk later."
244,00:10:29.70,00:10:29.70,"-All right. -No, it's my, it's my favorite."
245,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,ROGER: We had a tendency  for the whole group
246,00:10:34.47,00:10:34.47," to kind of get, you know,"
247,00:10:36.23,00:10:36.23," let's be festive  all afternoon, forgetting"
248,00:10:38.90,00:10:38.90,the fact that we had to get a shelter built.
249,00:10:41.07,00:10:41.07,"Did we decide we're gonna put the, uh,"
250,00:10:42.97,00:10:42.97,the chips and the bread and stuff in the basket?
251,00:10:47.17,00:10:47.17,That'll work.
252,00:10:48.80,00:10:48.80,"Hey, you can pack the beer."
253,00:10:50.30,00:10:50.30,-Here. -Use that inside the pack.
254,00:10:51.40,00:10:51.40,Why don't you just...
255,00:10:52.70,00:10:52.70,"Here, I'll use my raincoat for the beer, also."
256,00:10:55.73,00:10:55.73,"Well, it sure is not a priority."
257,00:10:57.23,00:10:57.23,Mine's not gonna fit in there. It's too heavy.
258,00:10:58.57,00:10:58.57,"ROGER:  And my focus was,"
259,00:10:59.70,00:10:59.70,"we got to keep the food, you know, iced up."
260,00:11:03.07,00:11:03.07," Well, the guys got into this,"
261,00:11:05.17,00:11:05.17," ""Well, let's make  a special deal,"
262,00:11:07.03,00:11:07.03," put the beer in there, make  sure we got that iced down."""
263,00:11:10.50,00:11:10.50,"And I, and I really-- I was really getting ticked off."
264,00:11:15.20,00:11:15.20,"-Take it, take it. -It's good cold beer, Roger."
265,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,We're going to drink it here in just a little bit.
266,00:11:19.87,00:11:19.87,"Butch, you need beer like a hole in the head and you know it."
267,00:11:22.73,00:11:22.73,"Well, it's something that we don't like..."
268,00:11:24.50,00:11:24.50,"-So it's warm, so it's warm! -All right, Rog."
269,00:11:26.17,00:11:26.17,"-Not that big a deal, Roger. -Here we go."
270,00:11:28.53,00:11:28.53,ALEX: The problem with Roger  is that he's an ass.
271,00:11:32.30,00:11:32.30,"He's loud, he obnoxious, he's bossy."
272,00:11:35.70,00:11:35.70, He thinks he knows everything.
273,00:11:38.07,00:11:38.07," And he wants to be  the dictator,"
274,00:11:39.07,00:11:39.07, wants to be the leader.
275,00:11:40.43,00:11:40.43, And what he thought was  important took precedence.
276,00:11:43.03,00:11:43.03,And he's yelling at everybody.
277,00:11:44.50,00:11:44.50,"We want to assign, uh... duties."
278,00:11:51.40,00:11:51.40,"Now, we're not that far from the water right here."
279,00:11:54.23,00:11:54.23,We are up high.
280,00:11:55.90,00:11:55.90,"It's a little bit of a gamble,"
281,00:11:56.97,00:11:56.97,as Roger and I were talking about.
282,00:11:58.33,00:11:58.33,It's a little bit of a gamble to stay right here.
283,00:12:00.43,00:12:00.43,I was a little concerned about that
284,00:12:02.03,00:12:02.03,150 feet thing that you're supposed to be from
285,00:12:04.03,00:12:04.03,the water's edge for the whole crocodile...
286,00:12:05.53,00:12:05.53,Have you seen down there?
287,00:12:06.70,00:12:06.70,-It looks fairly swampy. -I know.
288,00:12:08.10,00:12:08.10,We can move up there or we can stay here.
289,00:12:10.27,00:12:10.27,"My only suggestion is this: if we're going to stay here,"
290,00:12:12.87,00:12:12.87,I would rather the fire be over there.
291,00:12:15.00,00:12:15.00,"What, to keep the caiman away?"
292,00:12:16.20,00:12:16.20,-Yes. -Just to keep the caiman away.
293,00:12:17.73,00:12:17.73,"Doesn't have to be a big blazer, doesn't have to go all the time."
294,00:12:19.30,00:12:19.30,It really isn't necessary.
295,00:12:20.43,00:12:20.43,The caiman are not going to come up here.
296,00:12:21.73,00:12:21.73,"My-My training was, yes, they do."
297,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,-Right. -Uh-huh.
298,00:12:25.83,00:12:25.83,ROB: There is a lot of tension  between Deena and Roger.
299,00:12:29.87,00:12:29.87," Roger was in charge  of Tambaqui,"
300,00:12:32.80,00:12:32.80, and Deena was  the leader of Jaburu.
301,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30,And Deena is a very strong woman who I have a lot of respect for.
302,00:12:39.00,00:12:39.00, She's a lawyer.
303,00:12:40.50,00:12:40.50," She can argue her way out of  just about any situation,"
304,00:12:44.43,00:12:44.43,and Roger loves to hear himself talk.
305,00:12:46.27,00:12:46.27,This-- it's so different.
306,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17,"You know, we're not that much further from the water."
307,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,We're a little bit higher.
308,00:12:51.83,00:12:51.83,"The differential there, I don't think really gains us anything."
309,00:12:55.23,00:12:55.23,ROB: So you get these two together--
310,00:12:56.97,00:12:56.97," Roger thinks  that women are stupid,"
311,00:12:58.73,00:12:58.73," Deena thinks that women  are better than men,"
312,00:13:00.23,00:13:00.23, and there's just about  a million
313,00:13:02.07,00:13:02.07,"different conversations they could, they could go off on."
314,00:13:04.77,00:13:04.77,"At night, the caiman go into the water."
315,00:13:07.17,00:13:07.17,"All right, so we're staying here, cool."
316,00:13:08.83,00:13:08.83,"All right, cool."
317,00:13:10.20,00:13:10.20,"Just wanted, I just wanted everyone to be part of that."
318,00:13:12.80,00:13:12.80,-Yay! -Hey!
319,00:13:21.63,00:13:21.63,The roof will be like this.
320,00:13:23.50,00:13:23.50,That will be the end.
321,00:13:24.90,00:13:24.90,"But then, that-that-that causes us a problem,"
322,00:13:26.83,00:13:26.83,palm frond lengthwise.
323,00:13:28.90,00:13:28.90,"It's not going to be, you know, the same,"
324,00:13:30.47,00:13:30.47,but I think it's really got to be the way...
325,00:13:32.43,00:13:32.43,That's a pretty good long straight one.
326,00:13:34.17,00:13:34.17,"Oh, you know that song ""Hallelujah, It's Raining Men""?"
327,00:13:36.60,00:13:36.60,"You know, God love 'em."
328,00:13:38.53,00:13:38.53, You need 'em. You need--
329,00:13:40.33,00:13:40.33," ""All right,  getting the shelter together."""
330,00:13:41.63,00:13:41.63," Roger said, ""Okay,"
331,00:13:43.00,00:13:43.00," ""here we're going to  establish our floor"
332,00:13:44.13,00:13:44.13," ""and our base  and our perimeter,"
333,00:13:45.63,00:13:45.63," ""and roar, roar, roar, roar."
334,00:13:47.53,00:13:47.53,"And you two, you two go get palm fronds."""
335,00:13:50.27,00:13:50.27,"Um, can I start putting the floorboards down?"
336,00:13:53.30,00:13:53.30,"Well, we got that; we have that under control."
337,00:13:55.00,00:13:55.00,Helping Rob split the fronds would be really great.
338,00:13:58.20,00:13:58.20,Okay?
339,00:13:59.77,00:13:59.77,For the roof.
340,00:14:01.07,00:14:01.07,In here.
341,00:14:03.00,00:14:03.00,CHRISTY: I'm not working  on the shelter because
342,00:14:04.40,00:14:04.40,"it's a ""man"" thing to do or I'm not strong or..."
343,00:14:08.93,00:14:08.93,"If you don't have the mathematical set, frame, plan"
344,00:14:13.73,00:14:13.73,"like they have it-- which really pisses me off,"
345,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,because I really would like to be a part of it.
346,00:14:18.07,00:14:18.07," I mean, if I'm out here  pulling palm fronds and logs"
347,00:14:20.53,00:14:20.53,"and really trying to be a team,  I want to be able to"
348,00:14:23.47,00:14:23.47," put a log on there  and measure it and say, ""Hey,"""
349,00:14:26.17,00:14:26.17, and feel like I made the bed  as well as they did.
350,00:14:29.33,00:14:29.33,"But I'm cool. You know, if I can get"
351,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,the palm fronds done and have a little shelter
352,00:14:32.97,00:14:32.97,"before the rain comes, then okay, I'll be happy."
353,00:14:38.10,00:14:38.10,"It sucks, right?"
354,00:14:40.37,00:14:40.37,"I know the boys can drink, right?"
355,00:14:42.07,00:14:42.07,"""And only, only two can get palm fronds."""
356,00:14:44.03,00:14:44.03,I don't know. I'm a pretty good damn palm-frond-getter myself.
357,00:14:49.17,00:14:49.17,I really want to put the rest of the ice
358,00:14:51.37,00:14:51.37,"on top of the beer, but I'm so afraid."
359,00:14:53.43,00:14:53.43,Don't be afraid. Will you quit being afraid?
360,00:14:55.37,00:14:55.37,"ROB:  Coming into this merger,"
361,00:14:56.73,00:14:56.73,it's interesting to see what everybody is doing.
362,00:14:59.67,00:14:59.67, Some people are busy  building the shelter.
363,00:15:03.80,00:15:03.80," Other people, like myself,  are busy building alliances"
364,00:15:07.33,00:15:07.33, and working towards  the end of the game.
365,00:15:09.60,00:15:09.60," We'll see if you guys,  that are building the shelter,"
366,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27, are all going to be here
367,00:15:13.77,00:15:13.77,to use it for more than six or nine days.
368,00:15:18.63,00:15:18.63,But you understand what we have to do.
369,00:15:21.20,00:15:21.20,We have to start picking off the stronger males.
370,00:15:23.47,00:15:23.47,"Yeah, but please let Roger go first."
371,00:15:25.23,00:15:25.23,"-Please. -Oh, no, no, no."
372,00:15:26.40,00:15:26.40,"No. No, no."
373,00:15:27.57,00:15:27.57,I don't care what you want after that.
374,00:15:28.90,00:15:28.90,"But then after Roger, who?"
375,00:15:32.47,00:15:32.47,"I don't know, but he's gotta go."
376,00:15:34.43,00:15:34.43,Dave and Matt are the strongest men.
377,00:15:36.97,00:15:36.97,They're the most threatening.
378,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,"I know that they're both nice guys,"
379,00:15:39.60,00:15:39.60,but now it becomes a different game.
380,00:15:42.10,00:15:42.10,But Roger has got to go first.
381,00:15:43.53,00:15:43.53,"Because what will happen is, if he gets on the jury,"
382,00:15:45.87,00:15:45.87,"and then, say, just me or you--"
383,00:15:47.30,00:15:47.30,"okay, any of the girls--"
384,00:15:48.43,00:15:48.43,-he will vote against us. -Against.
385,00:15:49.67,00:15:49.67,So-- and there's no doubt in my mind.
386,00:15:51.27,00:15:51.27,He is a hard-core male all the way.
387,00:15:53.87,00:15:53.87,"DEENA: My initial thing was,  let's get rid of Dave."
388,00:15:57.27,00:15:57.27," He clearly is  one of the strongest,"
389,00:15:59.23,00:15:59.23, if not the strongest out here.
390,00:16:03.00,00:16:03.00,Jenna and Heidi had a good point--
391,00:16:05.27,00:16:05.27,"gotta give them their due-- they said, ""Listen..."
392,00:16:07.47,00:16:07.47," if we were to allow Roger  to be on the jury,"
393,00:16:11.30,00:16:11.30," he would never ever  vote for a female."""
394,00:16:15.07,00:16:15.07," Simply because we have  breasts and estrogen,"
395,00:16:16.77,00:16:16.77," we must be, somehow, so far  inferior to that of a man."
396,00:16:21.07,00:16:21.07,They're right. Screw him.
397,00:16:22.70,00:16:22.70,"-Uh, we're, uh... -Uh, we'll need something else."
398,00:16:25.23,00:16:25.23,"-Just like old times, you know. -Yup."
399,00:16:26.97,00:16:26.97,The six of us building a shelter together. It...
400,00:16:29.27,00:16:29.27,"-Hey, guys. -Yeah, we were just talking-- the guys"
401,00:16:31.20,00:16:31.20,"and I, and we think it's just a little too easy."
402,00:16:33.03,00:16:33.03,"We got six guys and four girls, and our original game plan was,"
403,00:16:36.57,00:16:36.57,"the six guys against... against the, uh..."
404,00:16:39.43,00:16:39.43,"against the girls, and, you know,"
405,00:16:42.37,00:16:42.37,"it should be, just pick 'em off."
406,00:16:43.83,00:16:43.83,And it just seems too easy.
407,00:16:46.23,00:16:46.23,"Uh, something probably is going to happen here. I..."
408,00:16:50.13,00:16:50.13,I'm not that... I'm not that confident yet.
409,00:16:52.30,00:16:52.30,We'll see.
410,00:16:53.77,00:16:53.77,Yeah.
411,00:16:56.03,00:16:56.03,"DAVE:  The initial plan, right now,"
412,00:16:57.70,00:16:57.70," is for the six guys  to eliminate the four girls,"
413,00:17:01.90,00:17:01.90," and I am going to vote  for Christy, because it seems"
414,00:17:05.60,00:17:05.60,that's the way the old alliance is voting.
415,00:17:07.80,00:17:07.80," And if I were her,  I'd be really worried,"
416,00:17:10.27,00:17:10.27, and I think Deena also saw  herself in that position
417,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33," because she's been butting  heads with Roger,"
418,00:17:14.27,00:17:14.27, and she knows that Roger
419,00:17:15.63,00:17:15.63,kind of has his alliance on one side.
420,00:17:17.80,00:17:17.80,(thunder rumbling)
421,00:17:20.33,00:17:20.33,(birds chirping)
422,00:17:28.00,00:17:28.00,Yeah.
423,00:17:29.23,00:17:29.23,"If we don't make it, we don't make it."
424,00:17:30.60,00:17:30.60,"This one we know doesn't reach, so go to this one?"
425,00:17:32.80,00:17:32.80,"ALEX: Roger is of the belief  that we are all, um..."
426,00:17:35.40,00:17:35.40," all the guys are together  and, um..."
427,00:17:38.80,00:17:38.80,"The fact of the matter is, um, Roger's first..."
428,00:17:41.17,00:17:41.17,"-Well, Roger's... -MATT: The second."
429,00:17:42.57,00:17:42.57,"-No, he's first on the list now. -MATT: Is he?"
430,00:17:44.37,00:17:44.37,-The list has changed. -MATT: Okay.
431,00:17:45.83,00:17:45.83,"He was being an ass earlier, so Roger's gonna be, uh, voted on."
432,00:17:48.43,00:17:48.43,"Unless he wins individual immunity,"
433,00:17:49.67,00:17:49.67,he'll be the first one to go.
434,00:17:51.40,00:17:51.40,"Butch, don't forget your water."
435,00:17:53.43,00:17:53.43,BUTCH: What?
436,00:17:54.67,00:17:54.67,Don't forget your water.
437,00:17:56.00,00:17:56.00,"MATT: This is a tough game,  and you have to"
438,00:17:58.47,00:17:58.47," identify people you can trust  and stick with them,"
439,00:18:01.27,00:18:01.27, and we're very comfortable  with our alliance.
440,00:18:04.20,00:18:04.20, We think it's going  to hold true
441,00:18:05.97,00:18:05.97,to the end.
442,00:18:07.60,00:18:07.60,"-And then when it's the five of us, uh... -Yeah."
443,00:18:09.80,00:18:09.80,...we'll sort it out amongst ourselves.
444,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,MATT: Exactly.
445,00:18:20.83,00:18:20.83,(all talking at once)
446,00:18:26.33,00:18:26.33,A can of beer and a cell phone.
447,00:18:28.33,00:18:28.33,-Can of beer... -(overlapping chatter)
448,00:18:30.87,00:18:30.87,-Particularly if we get soft. -Silver bullet.
449,00:18:33.37,00:18:33.37,"-Yeah, right here. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Salud."
450,00:18:35.30,00:18:35.30,To the ten.
451,00:18:36.37,00:18:36.37,-Jacar\xc3\xa9. -ROB: Camp is very festive.
452,00:18:38.37,00:18:38.37, And everybody  is hanging out except
453,00:18:40.37,00:18:40.37," for one man,  who's passed out,"
454,00:18:43.37,00:18:43.37, sleeping and snoring.
455,00:18:45.40,00:18:45.40,And it happens to be the same guy
456,00:18:47.30,00:18:47.30,that everybody wants to vote off.
457,00:18:49.40,00:18:49.40,-(snoring) -HEIDI: I was so nervous coming here.
458,00:18:51.37,00:18:51.37,ROB: I'm disappointed that none  of the girls are really
459,00:18:53.40,00:18:53.40, drinking that much.  That's a problem
460,00:18:55.40,00:18:55.40, when you're a guy  that looks like me.
461,00:18:57.90,00:18:57.90, I realize the only chance  I have with either
462,00:18:59.40,00:18:59.40, of those two girls is  if they get really drunk.
463,00:19:01.47,00:19:01.47,"But otherwise, it's still pretty crazy in there."
464,00:19:05.00,00:19:05.00,Now where is the weirdest place that you've ever had sex?
465,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,CHRISTY: I'd have to say
466,00:19:09.00,00:19:09.00,Fourth of July at the Washington Monument.
467,00:19:12.13,00:19:12.13,Fireworks.
468,00:19:13.60,00:19:13.60,Score. Yeah.
469,00:19:16.97,00:19:16.97,Not bad.
470,00:19:18.37,00:19:18.37,DAVE: We talked great sex talk  last night.
471,00:19:20.53,00:19:20.53,"Just swapping stories like, like friends, uh, back home."
472,00:19:24.53,00:19:24.53,"So I'm back there with these two chicks, and, uh,"
473,00:19:27.33,00:19:27.33,"I looked at this chick, and I'm, like,"
474,00:19:29.03,00:19:29.03,"""I dare you to eat this off of my stomach."""
475,00:19:31.17,00:19:31.17,"And she's, like, ""All right."""
476,00:19:32.73,00:19:32.73,"So you put the ice cube on the belly,"
477,00:19:34.03,00:19:34.03,"gets eaten off. So she's, like, ""Well, I dare you"
478,00:19:36.97,00:19:36.97,"to eat this out of my chest."" So I ate this ice cube"
479,00:19:39.07,00:19:39.07,"out of her chest, and then this one girl..."
480,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17,ROB:  I really dislike Dave.
481,00:19:43.07,00:19:43.07,"He thinks he's very slick and very smart,"
482,00:19:47.00,00:19:47.00,and he thinks he's a real ladies' man.
483,00:19:50.40,00:19:50.40, So it's very possible  that he could try to coerce
484,00:19:53.97,00:19:53.97," one of these girls  into voting with him,"
485,00:19:55.60,00:19:55.60, and I just hope  that all these girls
486,00:19:58.10,00:19:58.10, are solid enough to stand up
487,00:20:00.10,00:20:00.10,to this rocket scientist and his stupid all-American charm.
488,00:20:04.40,00:20:04.40,Rob-a-sue...
489,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,"My-My, uh, sex life, if you even would call it that,"
490,00:20:10.23,00:20:10.23,is so... is so mundane.
491,00:20:12.63,00:20:12.63,"Like, I've got so many crazy ideas in my head, that..."
492,00:20:15.93,00:20:15.93," Unfortunately, I don't have  that many good sex stories."
493,00:20:19.13,00:20:19.13,I hardly have any boring sex stories.
494,00:20:22.93,00:20:22.93, Most of my sex stories usually  involve me and a fat girl.
495,00:20:26.63,00:20:26.63,"And then both girls were there at the same time,"
496,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47,and it was really weird that both girls knew
497,00:20:31.30,00:20:31.30,that-that something was going on.
498,00:20:32.53,00:20:32.53,"-And, uh, like, I was... -Dude, you were there."
499,00:20:35.17,00:20:35.17,"-Seal the deal, dude. -You had the opportunity."
500,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,-You gotta close... You gotta close the deal. -Seal the deal.
501,00:20:39.00,00:20:39.00,"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure the girls didn't like each other."
502,00:20:41.53,00:20:41.53,-Doesn't matter. -Doesn't matter.
503,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,"HEIDI: Yeah, I really, honestly, don't think it does."
504,00:20:44.47,00:20:44.47,You know what?
505,00:20:45.67,00:20:45.67,"Seriously, as a guy, I think"
506,00:20:47.00,00:20:47.00,"you'd be amazed how many girls, if that..."
507,00:20:48.80,00:20:48.80,"if you said that's what you wanted to do,"
508,00:20:50.47,00:20:50.47,how quickly it would happen.
509,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"-Wouldn't it, Jenna? -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."
510,00:20:53.00,00:20:53.00,"-Don't you think so? -Yeah. -Being a woman,"
511,00:20:54.90,00:20:54.90,-I think it would. -JENNA: I like two girls and a guy...
512,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,HEIDI: Two girls and a guy.
513,00:20:57.70,00:20:57.70,JENNA: I'd propose it to the guy.
514,00:20:58.87,00:20:58.87,"HEIDI: Never, never two guys and a girl."
515,00:21:00.10,00:21:00.10,"JENNA: Or maybe just girls together, but..."
516,00:21:01.60,00:21:01.60,"ROB: The way Jenna and Heidi  were talking about threesomes,"
517,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,"I'm re-thinking my whole strategy,"
518,00:21:05.33,00:21:05.33,"so that the final three might be myself, Heidi and Jenna."
519,00:21:08.70,00:21:08.70," I could be having a threesome  on Day 37 out here,"
520,00:21:12.23,00:21:12.23,and this would just be the most
521,00:21:14.67,00:21:14.67,incredible adventure of my life.
522,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,"-(snores) -All right, lights out, sports fans."
523,00:21:19.30,00:21:19.30,"-JENNA: Good night, all. -HEIDI: Good night."
524,00:21:20.63,00:21:20.63,"-Good night... -Good night, Jacar\xc3\xa9."
525,00:21:21.90,00:21:21.90,"Good night, Rob Boy."
526,00:21:26.67,00:21:26.67,(birds squawking)
527,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,(clanking)
528,00:22:05.13,00:22:05.13,ROB:  I don't know
529,00:22:07.93,00:22:07.93, why Roger started  pushing everybody so hard.
530,00:22:11.50,00:22:11.50, The guy has no idea
531,00:22:13.10,00:22:13.10,how much of a jerk he is.
532,00:22:15.70,00:22:15.70, He has no sense  of self-awareness
533,00:22:17.10,00:22:17.10, that he can determine  that people don't like him.
534,00:22:21.17,00:22:21.17,Nobody likes him.
535,00:22:22.80,00:22:22.80,So how many people are gonna vote against Roger-- seven?
536,00:22:25.07,00:22:25.07,Seven against three?
537,00:22:27.63,00:22:27.63,"Oh, if Rog is gone, I'll be so happy."
538,00:22:30.83,00:22:30.83,"And I'm just gonna keep-keep kissing his ass the whole time,"
539,00:22:34.10,00:22:34.10,so he doesn't suspect a thing.
540,00:22:36.13,00:22:36.13,Are we still gonna be able to get-get Dave?
541,00:22:37.67,00:22:37.67,"Dave's second, you bet."
542,00:22:39.00,00:22:39.00,Dave-Dave is so charismatic that it just scares...
543,00:22:41.10,00:22:41.10,scares me to death.
544,00:22:42.47,00:22:42.47,DEENA: Because the girls are pissed off that they think
545,00:22:45.27,00:22:45.27,that we are so stupid
546,00:22:46.60,00:22:46.60,that we haven't been planning since day one.
547,00:22:48.37,00:22:48.37,-ROB: Okay. -(Deena scoffs) Ugh!
548,00:22:50.20,00:22:50.20,"DEENA:  Rob chose me, and I..."
549,00:22:53.93,00:22:53.93,I can honestly say that it's Rob and I
550,00:22:56.70,00:22:56.70,that have engineered this whole turnaround.
551,00:22:58.80,00:22:58.80,"And it is not the battle of the sexes anymore,"
552,00:23:01.67,00:23:01.67,but it's the battle of the weaker versus the stronger.
553,00:23:04.53,00:23:04.53,And they're so stinking cocky.
554,00:23:06.20,00:23:06.20,I hate that.
555,00:23:08.07,00:23:08.07,Never underestimate the power of a woman.
556,00:23:10.07,00:23:10.07,-Yeah. -Ever.
557,00:23:13.27,00:23:13.27,Silly boys.
558,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13,Games are for girls.
559,00:23:16.53,00:23:16.53,ROB: As long as one boy gets to come along in this game.
560,00:23:19.37,00:23:19.37,"Top three, baby, right here."
561,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,Boom.
562,00:23:23.97,00:23:23.97,"You, me and Jenna."
563,00:23:25.70,00:23:25.70,ROB: Okay.
564,00:23:27.53,00:23:27.53,"And then, of course, it's every girl for himself."
565,00:23:29.80,00:23:29.80,(Rob laughs)
566,00:23:31.43,00:23:31.43,"Oh, yeah!"
567,00:23:34.90,00:23:34.90,Dave's your daddy.
568,00:23:37.83,00:23:37.83,"Oh, look there-- he's got another one."
569,00:23:39.47,00:23:39.47,"-(Jenna mutters) -DEENA: Oh, look at that."
570,00:23:41.70,00:23:41.70,"Deena, we have a chance of being really, really close."
571,00:23:43.83,00:23:43.83,I know. I want to go all the way to the final three.
572,00:23:46.50,00:23:46.50,"We have to work it out to our benefit,"
573,00:23:48.47,00:23:48.47,'cause you have to understand Alex has a...
574,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,an alliance with Rob.
575,00:23:51.80,00:23:51.80,"I would rather take him out of the picture,"
576,00:23:53.80,00:23:53.80,and force Rob to come with us.
577,00:23:55.10,00:23:55.10,-Do you understand what I'm saying? -Yes.
578,00:23:57.20,00:23:57.20,How's it doing?
579,00:23:58.77,00:23:58.77,-Eleven. -DEENA: Oh.
580,00:24:00.33,00:24:00.33,Outstanding. What kind?
581,00:24:01.87,00:24:01.87,"MATT: Catfish,"
582,00:24:03.23,00:24:03.23,"some sort of herring, and a piranha."
583,00:24:06.40,00:24:06.40,-So everybody gets a fish? -Yup. -Yup.
584,00:24:08.37,00:24:08.37,MATT: And then some.
585,00:24:10.43,00:24:10.43,I may never win individual immunity.
586,00:24:12.43,00:24:12.43,"I may not, either."
587,00:24:13.77,00:24:13.77,-But it doesn't matter. -Doesn't matter.
588,00:24:15.90,00:24:15.90,Doesn't matter.
589,00:24:17.47,00:24:17.47,"DEENA:  Roger, Butch and Dave think"
590,00:24:19.10,00:24:19.10, that they have  this game sewn up.
591,00:24:22.57,00:24:22.57,"Sorry. There was an Adam, and then there was an Eve."
592,00:24:25.53,00:24:25.53,"And do you remember, Eve just kind of took Adam right along"
593,00:24:28.30,00:24:28.30,with the rest of the boat.
594,00:24:29.43,00:24:29.43,Oh!
595,00:24:30.70,00:24:30.70,DEENA: And that's what we're gonna do.
596,00:24:32.63,00:24:32.63," We're gonna play 'em,  we're gonna play 'em hard,"
597,00:24:34.10,00:24:34.10, because we're gonna beat them  at their own game.

697,00:28:48.53,00:28:48.53,I'm done talking.
698,00:28:49.90,00:28:49.90,It obviously won't be as spectacular as the two women.
699,00:28:53.00,00:28:53.00,"You're at, uh, 35 minutes right now."
700,00:28:55.70,00:28:55.70,"Yeah, I-I wanted to go by 30 minutes."

777,00:33:16.93,00:33:16.93, Or some sort of other thing  that only an old man

786,00:33:36.93,00:33:36.93,and get himself nothing? Yeah.
787,00:33:38.73,00:33:38.73,(chuckling)
788,00:33:40.10,00:33:40.10, He has no idea  that he's going home tonight.

797,00:34:01.47,00:34:01.47,and then we stood in front of the fire to warm our bodies.
798,00:34:03.87,00:34:03.87,I'm not trying to crowd you guys. Sorry.
799,00:34:05.50,00:34:05.50,DEENA:  And poor Roger is planning
800,00:34:07.23,00:34:07.23, all of these  interesting activities
801,00:34:08.90,00:34:08.90," for later on this evening,  and..."
802,00:34:10.57,00:34:10.57,Roger's going home.
803,00:34:12.67,00:34:12.67,-I really don't have to pack. -No.
804,00:34:14.67,00:34:14.67,Would people be offended if I did not pack?
805,00:34:16.60,00:34:16.60,-No. You can't pack. -You can't get kicked...
806,00:34:18.53,00:34:18.53,"The women are gone, and it... it's that simple."
807,00:34:21.30,00:34:21.30, And it looks  as though it-it's...
808,00:34:23.53,00:34:23.53," everything is falling  into place,"
809,00:34:25.57,00:34:25.57, exactly like we planned it.
810,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83," Uh, you know,"
811,00:34:28.10,00:34:28.10,and I'm sitting here saying it's...
812,00:34:29.70,00:34:29.70,it's too good to be true.
813,00:34:31.50,00:34:31.50,"HEIDI: I'm sitting there thinking,"
814,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,"""Where's the effing peanut butter? I'm..."
815,00:34:34.13,00:34:34.13,"I'm going to grind the peanuts myself."""
816,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80,"I was like, ""Jeff, get these girls some peanut butter!"""
817,00:34:38.77,00:34:38.77,(laughter)
818,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,We are definitely the original
819,00:34:41.60,00:34:41.60, -Survivor Girls Gone Wild. -HEIDI: Yeah.
820,00:34:42.90,00:34:42.90,"-Yeah, definitely. -There's no doubt about it."
821,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20,HEIDI: We are the Amazon chicks.
822,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,"-So, really... -Gee, and-and the..."
823,00:34:46.93,00:34:46.93,"oh, what makes it even more funny,"
824,00:34:48.37,00:34:48.37,is the guys think that they're slowly picking us off.
825,00:34:50.20,00:34:50.20,-Yes. Yes. -Which is so...
826,00:34:51.27,00:34:51.27,And they're being
827,00:34:52.27,00:34:52.27, so nice to me and Heidi.
828,00:34:53.37,00:34:53.37," They're like, ""You know what?"
829,00:34:54.47,00:34:54.47,"You're going to go eventually."""
830,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83," -And we're like, ""Aw...""  -HEIDI: Yeah."
831,00:34:57.17,00:34:57.17,"HEIDI:  ""We'll try to spare you."
832,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17," We'll try to spare you guys."""
833,00:34:59.73,00:34:59.73,"JENNA: Yeah, and we're, like,  ""You guys are so sweet."""
834,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,Especially with... with Roger.
835,00:35:03.53,00:35:03.53,"-Oh... oh. -I mean, he could've... he..."
836,00:35:04.93,00:35:04.93,he thinks that he's just got it in the bag.
837,00:35:06.87,00:35:06.87,(thunder rumbling)
838,00:35:14.53,00:35:14.53,Nothing we can do about it now.
839,00:35:15.80,00:35:15.80,DAVE: I think that all four  of the females
840,00:35:19.17,00:35:19.17," realize that they are going  to be quickly eliminated,"
841,00:35:24.20,00:35:24.20, because the six males  are starting
842,00:35:26.17,00:35:26.17, to stick together  a little bit better.
843,00:35:28.20,00:35:28.20, I don't think  that they're surprised that...
844,00:35:31.77,00:35:31.77,four girls and six guys--
845,00:35:34.23,00:35:34.23,they're looking to go packing pretty quick.
846,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03,"We're on, guys."
847,00:35:39.07,00:35:39.07,"And that pot has been boiled, huh?"
848,00:35:41.30,00:35:41.30,ROB: I realized early on  that the other men
849,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90, that I was dealt with  are a bunch of jamokes.
850,00:35:48.20,00:35:48.20, They have no idea  that the women are capable
851,00:35:50.07,00:35:50.07, of taking them all out  at this point in the game.
852,00:35:52.93,00:35:52.93, I will go as far as to say
853,00:35:54.50,00:35:54.50, that I know  that I'm going to be
854,00:35:55.70,00:35:55.70, the last man standing  in this game.
855,00:35:58.03,00:35:58.03, And I don't think
856,00:35:59.43,00:35:59.43,any of the other men
857,00:36:01.00,00:36:01.00,have any idea what's going on around them.
858,00:36:23.30,00:36:23.30,Okay.
859,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,"Last time I saw you guys,"
860,00:36:26.27,00:36:26.27,"before the challenge, you were heading out"
861,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,in a new boat as one tribe.
862,00:36:29.47,00:36:29.47,"Butch, what was the new tribe's first order of business?"
863,00:36:33.10,00:36:33.10,"Well, what we wanted to do first was, of course,"
864,00:36:34.90,00:36:34.90,establish a... a place of residency.
865,00:36:36.20,00:36:36.20,"And, uh, we felt it was important... at least I felt"
866,00:36:38.53,00:36:38.53,it was important to include everybody
867,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,and everybody's opinion.
868,00:36:41.87,00:36:41.87,So I say we all came together as a team.
869,00:36:43.60,00:36:43.60,"Is that accurate, Rob?"
870,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,Was it pretty inclusive?
871,00:36:45.93,00:36:45.93,Everybody had a... a part to play.
872,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,"If you didn't know what you were particularly good at,"
873,00:36:50.77,00:36:50.77,there was a couple people that were more than happy
874,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,to tell you where you should be going
875,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,and what you should be doing.
876,00:36:55.97,00:36:55.97,"And, uh, we did get the shelter up pretty quickly,"
877,00:36:58.07,00:36:58.07,so I guess it worked.
878,00:36:59.37,00:36:59.37,"PROBST: Okay, I'll read between the lines."
879,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,There were a couple of people more than willing
880,00:37:03.03,00:37:03.03,to tell you what to do.
881,00:37:04.77,00:37:04.77,"Are you saying there were bossy people quickly,"
882,00:37:06.70,00:37:06.70,or are you saying you like being subservient
883,00:37:08.77,00:37:08.77,to people who decide what to do?
884,00:37:10.07,00:37:10.07,I like being subservient
885,00:37:11.30,00:37:11.30,to the people that decide what to do.
886,00:37:13.43,00:37:13.43,"PROBST: Deena, did any women viably participate"
887,00:37:16.30,00:37:16.30,in building the shelter?
888,00:37:17.37,00:37:17.37,Putting the logs together
889,00:37:18.87,00:37:18.87,with the four corners of the foundation? No.
890,00:37:21.60,00:37:21.60,But you know what? We so had the opportunity
891,00:37:24.33,00:37:24.33,"to re-bond with one another,"
892,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,and I think that is so far more important
893,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,than putting together the four corners of the structure.
894,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,"PROBST: Roger, you've got"
895,00:37:30.93,00:37:30.93,a real smug look on your face right now.
896,00:37:33.43,00:37:33.43,"You can have too many Indians, in this case,"
897,00:37:36.83,00:37:36.83,creating a structure.
898,00:37:37.93,00:37:37.93,"I mean, if there were more than four of us"
899,00:37:39.90,00:37:39.90,"putting together the foundation, it wouldn't have worked,"
900,00:37:41.80,00:37:41.80,"but, uh, it-it was going to be done that way, regardless."
901,00:37:44.80,00:37:44.80,"I mean, it was important for the new tribe to establish"
902,00:37:47.93,00:37:47.93,"a very, uh, strong and stable shelter as quickly as we could."
903,00:37:52.37,00:37:52.37,"Jenna, let's talk about the challenge today."
904,00:37:55.37,00:37:55.37,Okay.
905,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,"Well, certainly, you and Heidi"
906,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,provided a highlight at the challenge.
907,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,"Aside from the fact that you got naked for peanut butter,"
908,00:38:04.07,00:38:04.07,"you guys jumped off that perch,"
909,00:38:06.03,00:38:06.03,"first two, and it wasn't very long in."
910,00:38:07.97,00:38:07.97,We're playing for immunity.
911,00:38:09.23,00:38:09.23,"Where does the confidence come from to say,"
912,00:38:11.40,00:38:11.40,"""I'm really not worried?"""
913,00:38:12.63,00:38:12.63,If one of us gets kicked off tonight
914,00:38:14.60,00:38:14.60,"because we jumped off for peanut butter and cookies,"
915,00:38:17.10,00:38:17.10,"-it was still worth it 'cause it was fun, -Yeah. Yeah."
916,00:38:20.33,00:38:20.33,"-and it was really, really good. -I totally agree."
917,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,"Now, Roger, you weren't long after."
918,00:38:24.90,00:38:24.90,"Yeah. Yeah, and I rationalized the whole thing."
919,00:38:27.70,00:38:27.70,"""Hey, I'm not going to win immunity on this,"
920,00:38:30.40,00:38:30.40,"so I might as well just jump in."""
921,00:38:32.67,00:38:32.67,"Would it have been different for you,"
922,00:38:34.40,00:38:34.40,"knowing that you didn't feel you could win,"
923,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,but you knew you needed it?
924,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,Would you have hung in there longer?
925,00:38:39.57,00:38:39.57,"Obviously, if I really felt that I needed that immunity,"
926,00:38:43.60,00:38:43.60,I would've given it my all. Yes.
927,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,"Deena, you are the only one who cannot be voted for tonight,"
928,00:38:50.40,00:38:50.40,"but because you have that immunity around your neck,"
929,00:38:53.40,00:38:53.40,if you thought there was somebody
930,00:38:54.83,00:38:54.83,"that needed protecting tonight,"
931,00:38:56.27,00:38:56.27,you can assign that immunity to somebody else.
932,00:38:58.90,00:38:58.90,I choose not to.
933,00:39:00.43,00:39:00.43,I choose to assign it to myself.
934,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,PROBST: It is time to vote.
935,00:39:04.33,00:39:04.33,"Jenna, you're first."
936,00:39:20.37,00:39:20.37,"Christy, I wish today you had hung in there."
937,00:39:23.53,00:39:23.53," You would've stayed there,"
938,00:39:24.90,00:39:24.90, and you definitely would not  have received my vote.
939,00:39:27.47,00:39:27.47,You've contributed greatly to the tribe.
940,00:39:39.33,00:39:39.33,Reality check and mate.
941,00:39:42.53,00:39:42.53,Never underestimate the power of a woman.
942,00:40:00.97,00:40:00.97,(imitating Casey Kasem): Here comes tonight's
943,00:40:03.07,00:40:03.07,long-distance dedication.
944,00:40:05.07,00:40:05.07,It goes out to Rob from New York.
945,00:40:08.37,00:40:08.37,"He writes, ""Dear, Casey,"
946,00:40:10.83,00:40:10.83,"""there's a mean old man in my life"
947,00:40:13.47,00:40:13.47," ""that's about to leave."
948,00:40:14.90,00:40:14.90," Could you please play  something appropriate for me?"""
949,00:40:17.87,00:40:17.87,"Well, Rob, here's your request:"
950,00:40:20.33,00:40:20.33,\xe2\x99\xaa Na-na-na-na... \xe2\x99\xaa
951,00:40:22.13,00:40:22.13,\xe2\x99\xaa Na-na-na-na \xe2\x99\xaa
952,00:40:24.07,00:40:24.07,"\xe2\x99\xaa Hey, hey, hey \xe2\x99\xaa"
953,00:40:26.57,00:40:26.57,\xe2\x99\xaa Good-bye. \xe2\x99\xaa
954,00:40:33.67,00:40:33.67,I'll go tally the votes.
955,00:40:43.23,00:40:43.23,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
956,00:40:45.83,00:40:45.83,Person voted out will be asked
957,00:40:47.17,00:40:47.17,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
958,00:40:48.83,00:40:48.83,I'll read the votes.
959,00:40:50.83,00:40:50.83,First vote.
960,00:40:54.57,00:40:54.57,Christy.
961,00:40:59.17,00:40:59.17,Christy. Two votes Christy.
962,00:41:05.83,00:41:05.83,Roger.
963,00:41:07.43,00:41:07.43,"One vote Roger, two votes Christy."
964,00:41:13.83,00:41:13.83,"That's two votes Roger, two votes Christy."
965,00:41:19.10,00:41:19.10,Three votes Christy.
966,00:41:22.40,00:41:22.40,"We're tied-- three votes Roger,"
967,00:41:24.23,00:41:24.23,three votes Christy.
968,00:41:27.73,00:41:27.73,"That's four votes Roger,"
969,00:41:29.43,00:41:29.43,three votes Christy.
970,00:41:36.30,00:41:36.30,That's five votes Roger.
971,00:41:42.17,00:41:42.17,Seventh person voted out of the tribe:
972,00:41:45.43,00:41:45.43,Roger.
973,00:41:46.93,00:41:46.93,Need to bring me your torch.
974,00:41:58.50,00:41:58.50,"Roger, the tribe has spoken."
975,00:42:02.53,00:42:02.53,It's time for you to go.
976,00:42:13.67,00:42:13.67,"PROBST: Well, from this point forward, the game changes,"
977,00:42:16.90,00:42:16.90,because you are the final nine.
978,00:42:18.40,00:42:18.40,Seven of you will make it to the jury.
979,00:42:20.90,00:42:20.90,One of you will be the sole survivor.
980,00:42:22.07,00:42:22.07,Grab your torches.
981,00:42:23.53,00:42:23.53,Head back to camp. Good night.
982,00:42:37.53,00:42:37.53,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
983,00:42:43.83,00:42:43.83,PROBST:   Next time on Survivor:
984,00:42:45.73,00:42:45.73, Matt loses touch with reality.
985,00:42:47.50,00:42:47.50,"Once again, he is sharpening his machete."
986,00:42:50.20,00:42:50.20,I know.
987,00:42:51.57,00:42:51.57,"ALEX: Matt's kind of  losing it out here,"
988,00:42:53.20,00:42:53.20,and nobody's all that comfortable around him.
989,00:42:56.90,00:42:56.90,PROBST: And Heidi and Dave  get in touch with each other.
990,00:42:58.90,00:42:58.90,ROB: I don't like the fact  that somebody in my alliance
991,00:43:02.30,00:43:02.30, is sleeping with the enemy.
992,00:43:08.90,00:43:08.90,"I am a very strong individual, and I am a leader,"
993,00:43:12.60,00:43:12.60,and I can't hold that back.
994,00:43:14.17,00:43:14.17,"I said from the beginning, ""I'm my worst enemy in this game"
995,00:43:18.37,00:43:18.37,"because I am very strong-willed."""
996,00:43:20.97,00:43:20.97,"I'll never see these people again in my life,"
997,00:43:23.40,00:43:23.40,and I don't think I got outwitted or outplayed.
998,00:43:26.57,00:43:26.57,Definitely got outlasted.
