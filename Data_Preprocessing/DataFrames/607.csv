9,00:00:19.07,00:00:19.07,SHAWNA: I want to get to know him better.
10,00:00:20.13,00:00:20.13,He is an incredible person.

16,00:00:36.30,00:00:36.30,"And I said,""Listen, I need some help."""

20,00:00:44.70,00:00:44.70," So Jaburu went to Tribal Council,"
21,00:00:46.60,00:00:46.60, where Alex looked on as Shawna became the sixth person
22,00:00:49.77,00:00:49.77, voted out of the Amazon.
23,00:00:53.43,00:00:53.43, Ten are left.
24,00:00:54.70,00:00:54.70, Who will be voted out tonight?
25,00:02:02.83,00:02:02.83,(footsteps approaching)
26,00:02:07.70,00:02:07.70,"Don't step on the fire,everyone."
27,00:02:09.67,00:02:09.67,What's that?
28,00:02:10.67,00:02:10.67,Don't step on the fire.
29,00:02:12.57,00:02:12.57,DEENA: Tribal Council tonight was awful.
30,00:02:14.73,00:02:14.73, Shawna is gone.
31,00:02:16.37,00:02:16.37,Somebody's gonna have todo fire shift by themselves.
32,00:02:18.27,00:02:18.27," You know, we miss"
33,00:02:19.40,00:02:19.40,"that extra little spark,"
34,00:02:21.13,00:02:21.13,the extra little bandanawith the sunglasses.
35,00:02:23.73,00:02:23.73,I hate Tribal Council.
36,00:02:26.23,00:02:26.23,"I feel physically, mentallyand emotionally exhausted."
37,00:02:30.20,00:02:30.20,"ROB: Alex, I think, is a little bit"
38,00:02:32.70,00:02:32.70,depressed that Shawnais not here anymore.
39,00:02:35.27,00:02:35.27," And I'll be honest, it's not the same"
40,00:02:37.33,00:02:37.33," not having another, uh,"
41,00:02:38.93,00:02:38.93," 23-year-old girl in a bikini around, but"
42,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17,maybe he'll get his head outof his ass and start thinking
43,00:02:44.43,00:02:44.43,"about the game again,like he should be."
44,00:02:45.77,00:02:45.77,"As a team, do you guys thinkit's a good idea for"
45,00:02:49.27,00:02:49.27,the three guys-- should we havea merger-- to go back
46,00:02:52.43,00:02:52.43,"to the other three guys and saythat, that we kept their plan"
47,00:02:55.17,00:02:55.17,"all along and keptall the guys together,"
48,00:02:57.93,00:02:57.93,and that's whyShawna got voted out?
49,00:03:00.87,00:03:00.87,But then you're just gonnapick us girls off.
50,00:03:02.33,00:03:02.33,"No, but we're not reallygonna do that."
51,00:03:04.13,00:03:04.13,We're just gonna tell them.
52,00:03:05.40,00:03:05.40,Then you guys can alsoget the two girls to vote.
53,00:03:09.67,00:03:09.67,"See, Heidi, I have confidencein; Christy, I do not."
54,00:03:12.03,00:03:12.03,"You guys would have toget Heidi, then we'd be able"
55,00:03:15.40,00:03:15.40,to split up their voteand we could knock off Dave.
56,00:03:18.23,00:03:18.23,Mm-hmm.
57,00:03:19.23,00:03:19.23,This is just our insurance
58,00:03:20.97,00:03:20.97,to make sure it's notgonna be a five-five tie.
59,00:03:22.80,00:03:22.80,"It's kind of, uh, deceptive,though, and it's only a sug--"
60,00:03:24.77,00:03:24.77,it's only a suggestion.
61,00:03:26.47,00:03:26.47,ROB: I don't like having to
62,00:03:27.73,00:03:27.73," discuss strategy in an open forum,"
63,00:03:29.90,00:03:29.90," but should there be a merger in the next three days,"
64,00:03:32.77,00:03:32.77,I just wanted to make sure that
65,00:03:34.00,00:03:34.00,all these knuckleheadsunderstand the plan.
66,00:03:36.07,00:03:36.07,"Alex, are youcomfortable with that?"
67,00:03:37.43,00:03:37.43,Absolutely.
68,00:03:38.47,00:03:38.47,This is my thinking.
69,00:03:40.63,00:03:40.63,Dave is probably the physicallystrongest out of everyone.
70,00:03:44.80,00:03:44.80,"I'm concerned that,what-what if it never...?"
71,00:03:47.10,00:03:47.10,"If we give him the opportunityto win immunity,"
72,00:03:49.10,00:03:49.10,-he'll take it.-Yes. Yes.
73,00:03:50.57,00:03:50.57,That's fine with me.
74,00:03:51.80,00:03:51.80,"If we can pinch Dave,"
75,00:03:53.40,00:03:53.40,then the whole house of cardsis gonna crumble.
76,00:03:55.80,00:03:55.80,-Yep.-Mm-hmm.
77,00:03:56.80,00:03:56.80," Once we have that majority,"
78,00:03:58.00,00:03:58.00,"it's-- ""Roger, shut up."
79,00:04:01.20,00:04:01.20,"""Shut up, Roger."
80,00:04:02.27,00:04:02.27,"Stop talking, Roger."""
81,00:04:03.67,00:04:03.67," And finally, the shoe will be on the other foot."
82,00:04:07.00,00:04:07.00,And it's gonna feel really good.
83,00:04:08.03,00:04:08.03,-Yes.-Mm-hmm.
84,00:04:09.27,00:04:09.27,That's gonna bea highlight of my game.
85,00:04:21.67,00:04:21.67,(chittering)
86,00:04:29.30,00:04:29.30,Welcome. You have treemail.

94,00:04:46.80,00:04:46.80,(shouting excitedly)
95,00:04:48.60,00:04:48.60," DEENA: Now, mind you, there's been this box"
96,00:04:50.43,00:04:50.43, inside of our supplies
97,00:04:52.23,00:04:52.23,since day one.
98,00:04:54.07,00:04:54.07,And it drives everybody nuts.
99,00:04:55.30,00:04:55.30,"You know, you shake it,you throw it, you drop it,"
100,00:04:57.43,00:04:57.43,you want to know what's inside.
101,00:04:58.60,00:04:58.60,BUTCH: We were all excited
102,00:05:00.07,00:05:00.07, because we got to open

104,00:05:02.73,00:05:02.73,(humming fanfare)
105,00:05:04.60,00:05:04.60, We speculated for 18 days what was in there.
106,00:05:07.13,00:05:07.13,Huh.
107,00:05:08.57,00:05:08.57,"Boy, isn't that great."
108,00:05:09.93,00:05:09.93,"""You started men and women,then mixed it up for fun,"
109,00:05:14.13,00:05:14.13,"For those who survive 19 days,it's time to live as one..."""
110,00:05:20.27,00:05:20.27,"""Paddle to your new location,leave your old life behind,"

209,00:09:30.93,00:09:30.93,Burger right here.
210,00:09:32.20,00:09:32.20,(excited chattering)
211,00:09:34.03,00:09:34.03,Here you go!
212,00:09:35.50,00:09:35.50,DAVE: We're at a new point.
213,00:09:36.73,00:09:36.73, It's new people.
214,00:09:38.43,00:09:38.43,It's new friendships to be made.
215,00:09:39.73,00:09:39.73,And it's just-- it was just
216,00:09:41.03,00:09:41.03, a flurry of excitement.
217,00:09:42.80,00:09:42.80," Nobody's thinking about who's going off next, at that point."
218,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10," They're thinking, we are blessed"
219,00:09:46.70,00:09:46.70, to have this meal right now.
220,00:09:48.67,00:09:48.67,Let's celebrate.
221,00:09:49.53,00:09:49.53,-Yeah!-Who wants a beer?
222,00:09:50.77,00:09:50.77,(cheering)
223,00:09:52.37,00:09:52.37,"Hey, here's to the new tribeand here's to new friends."
224,00:09:54.10,00:09:54.10,Yay!
225,00:09:56.23,00:09:56.23,-Cheers.-Cheers to you all.
226,00:09:58.10,00:09:58.10,"Congratulations, final ten."
227,00:10:04.03,00:10:04.03,"-Let's take it slow and reallyenjoy it, guys. -You know it. "
228,00:10:06.20,00:10:06.20,So what about our name?
229,00:10:07.70,00:10:07.70,We have some ideasfor a new tribe name.
230,00:10:10.33,00:10:10.33,-Jacaré.-Jacaré.
231,00:10:11.60,00:10:11.60,"Which is Portuguesefor ""alligator."""
232,00:10:12.90,00:10:12.90,"For ""caiman."" Alligator."
233,00:10:13.97,00:10:13.97,"-And ""crocodile.""-That's not bad."
234,00:10:15.13,00:10:15.13,I have no other suggestion.
235,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,-I'm fine.-A tribe is born.
236,00:10:17.23,00:10:17.23,-Jacaré. -Jacaré.-Jacaré. -Jacaré.
237,00:10:19.40,00:10:19.40,"Good salsa, too."
238,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,"-I don't want to get up.-I don't want to get up, either."
239,00:10:25.13,00:10:25.13,"I'm eating chips, man."
240,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13,Hand me a dog.
241,00:10:27.23,00:10:27.23,What has he been saying?
242,00:10:28.43,00:10:28.43,"Ah, we'll talk later."
243,00:10:29.70,00:10:29.70,"-All right.-No, it's my, it's my favorite."
244,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,ROGER: We had a tendency for the whole group
245,00:10:34.47,00:10:34.47," to kind of get, you know,"
246,00:10:36.23,00:10:36.23," let's be festive all afternoon, forgetting"
247,00:10:38.90,00:10:38.90,the fact that we had to geta shelter built.
248,00:10:41.07,00:10:41.07,"Did we decidewe're gonna put the, uh,"
249,00:10:42.97,00:10:42.97,the chips and the breadand stuff in the basket?
250,00:10:47.17,00:10:47.17,That'll work.
251,00:10:48.80,00:10:48.80,"Hey, you can pack the beer."
252,00:10:50.30,00:10:50.30,-Here.-Use that inside the pack.
253,00:10:51.40,00:10:51.40,Why don't you just...
254,00:10:52.70,00:10:52.70,"Here, I'll use my raincoatfor the beer, also."
255,00:10:55.73,00:10:55.73,"Well, it sure is not a priority."
256,00:10:57.23,00:10:57.23,Mine's not gonna fit in there.It's too heavy.
257,00:10:58.57,00:10:58.57,"ROGER: And my focus was,"
258,00:10:59.70,00:10:59.70,"we got to keep the food,you know, iced up."
259,00:11:03.07,00:11:03.07," Well, the guys got into this,"
260,00:11:05.17,00:11:05.17," ""Well, let's make a special deal,"
261,00:11:07.03,00:11:07.03," put the beer in there, make sure we got that iced down."""
262,00:11:10.50,00:11:10.50,"And I, and I really--I was really getting ticked off."
263,00:11:15.20,00:11:15.20,"-Take it, take it.-It's good cold beer, Roger."
264,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,We're going to drink it herein just a little bit.
265,00:11:19.87,00:11:19.87,"Butch, you need beer like a holein the head and you know it."
266,00:11:22.73,00:11:22.73,"Well, it's somethingthat we don't like..."
267,00:11:24.50,00:11:24.50,"-So it's warm, so it's warm!-All right, Rog."
268,00:11:26.17,00:11:26.17,"-Not that big a deal, Roger.-Here we go."
269,00:11:28.53,00:11:28.53,ALEX: The problem with Roger is that he's an ass.
270,00:11:32.30,00:11:32.30,"He's loud, he obnoxious,he's bossy."
271,00:11:35.70,00:11:35.70, He thinks he knows everything.
272,00:11:38.07,00:11:38.07," And he wants to be the dictator,"
273,00:11:39.07,00:11:39.07, wants to be the leader.
274,00:11:40.43,00:11:40.43, And what he thought was important took precedence.
275,00:11:43.03,00:11:43.03,And he's yelling at everybody.
276,00:11:44.50,00:11:44.50,"We want to assign, uh... duties."
277,00:11:51.40,00:11:51.40,"Now, we're not that farfrom the water right here."
278,00:11:54.23,00:11:54.23,We are up high.
279,00:11:55.90,00:11:55.90,"It's a little bit of a gamble,"
280,00:11:56.97,00:11:56.97,as Roger and Iwere talking about.
281,00:11:58.33,00:11:58.33,It's a little bit of a gambleto stay right here.
282,00:12:00.43,00:12:00.43,I was a little concernedabout that
283,00:12:02.03,00:12:02.03,150 feet thingthat you're supposed to be from
284,00:12:04.03,00:12:04.03,the water's edgefor the whole crocodile...
285,00:12:05.53,00:12:05.53,Have you seen down there?
286,00:12:06.70,00:12:06.70,-It looks fairly swampy.-I know.
287,00:12:08.10,00:12:08.10,We can move up thereor we can stay here.
288,00:12:10.27,00:12:10.27,"My only suggestion is this:if we're going to stay here,"
289,00:12:12.87,00:12:12.87,I would rather the firebe over there.
290,00:12:15.00,00:12:15.00,"What, to keep the caiman away?"
291,00:12:16.20,00:12:16.20,-Yes.-Just to keep the caiman away.
292,00:12:17.73,00:12:17.73,"Doesn't have to be a big blazer,doesn't have to go all the time."
293,00:12:19.30,00:12:19.30,It really isn't necessary.
294,00:12:20.43,00:12:20.43,The caiman are notgoing to come up here.
295,00:12:21.73,00:12:21.73,"My-My training was,yes, they do."
296,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,-Right.-Uh-huh.
297,00:12:25.83,00:12:25.83,ROB: There is a lot of tension between Deena and Roger.
298,00:12:29.87,00:12:29.87," Roger was in charge of Tambaqui,"
299,00:12:32.80,00:12:32.80, and Deena was the leader of Jaburu.
300,00:12:35.30,00:12:35.30,And Deena is a very strong womanwho I have a lot of respect for.
301,00:12:39.00,00:12:39.00, She's a lawyer.
302,00:12:40.50,00:12:40.50," She can argue her way out of just about any situation,"
303,00:12:44.43,00:12:44.43,and Roger lovesto hear himself talk.
304,00:12:46.27,00:12:46.27,This-- it's so different.
305,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17,"You know, we're not that muchfurther from the water."
306,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,We're a little bit higher.
307,00:12:51.83,00:12:51.83,"The differential there, I don'tthink really gains us anything."
308,00:12:55.23,00:12:55.23,ROB:So you get these two together--
309,00:12:56.97,00:12:56.97," Roger thinks that women are stupid,"
310,00:12:58.73,00:12:58.73," Deena thinks that women are better than men,"
311,00:13:00.23,00:13:00.23, and there's just about a million
312,00:13:02.07,00:13:02.07,"different conversations theycould, they could go off on."
313,00:13:04.77,00:13:04.77,"At night, the caiman gointo the water."
314,00:13:07.17,00:13:07.17,"All right,so we're staying here, cool."
315,00:13:08.83,00:13:08.83,"All right, cool."
316,00:13:10.20,00:13:10.20,"Just wanted, I just wantedeveryone to be part of that."
317,00:13:12.80,00:13:12.80,-Yay!-Hey!
318,00:13:21.63,00:13:21.63,The roof will be like this.
319,00:13:23.50,00:13:23.50,That will be the end.
320,00:13:24.90,00:13:24.90,"But then, that-that-thatcauses us a problem,"
321,00:13:26.83,00:13:26.83,palm frond lengthwise.
322,00:13:28.90,00:13:28.90,"It's not going to be,you know, the same,"
323,00:13:30.47,00:13:30.47,but I think it's reallygot to be the way...
324,00:13:32.43,00:13:32.43,That's a pretty good longstraight one.
325,00:13:34.17,00:13:34.17,"Oh, you know that song""Hallelujah, It's Raining Men""?"
326,00:13:36.60,00:13:36.60,"You know, God love 'em."
327,00:13:38.53,00:13:38.53, You need 'em. You need--
328,00:13:40.33,00:13:40.33," ""All right, getting the shelter together."""
329,00:13:41.63,00:13:41.63," Roger said, ""Okay,"
330,00:13:43.00,00:13:43.00," ""here we're going to establish our floor"
331,00:13:44.13,00:13:44.13," ""and our base and our perimeter,"
332,00:13:45.63,00:13:45.63," ""and roar, roar, roar, roar."
333,00:13:47.53,00:13:47.53,"And you two,you two go get palm fronds."""
334,00:13:50.27,00:13:50.27,"Um, can I startputting the floorboards down?"
335,00:13:53.30,00:13:53.30,"Well, we got that;we have that under control."
336,00:13:55.00,00:13:55.00,Helping Rob split the frondswould be really great.
337,00:13:58.20,00:13:58.20,Okay?
338,00:13:59.77,00:13:59.77,For the roof.
339,00:14:01.07,00:14:01.07,In here.
340,00:14:03.00,00:14:03.00,CHRISTY: I'm not working on the shelter because
341,00:14:04.40,00:14:04.40,"it's a ""man"" thing to door I'm not strong or..."
342,00:14:08.93,00:14:08.93,"If you don't have themathematical set, frame, plan"
343,00:14:13.73,00:14:13.73,"like they have it--which really pisses me off,"
344,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,because I really wouldlike to be a part of it.
345,00:14:18.07,00:14:18.07," I mean, if I'm out here pulling palm fronds and logs"
346,00:14:20.53,00:14:20.53,"and really trying to be a team, I want to be able to"
347,00:14:23.47,00:14:23.47," put a log on there and measure it and say, ""Hey,"""
348,00:14:26.17,00:14:26.17, and feel like I made the bed as well as they did.
349,00:14:29.33,00:14:29.33,"But I'm cool.You know, if I can get"
350,00:14:30.93,00:14:30.93,the palm fronds doneand have a little shelter
351,00:14:32.97,00:14:32.97,"before the rain comes,then okay, I'll be happy."
352,00:14:38.10,00:14:38.10,"It sucks, right?"
353,00:14:40.37,00:14:40.37,"I know the boyscan drink, right?"
354,00:14:42.07,00:14:42.07,"""And only, only two canget palm fronds."""
355,00:14:44.03,00:14:44.03,I don't know. I'm a pretty gooddamn palm-frond-getter myself.
356,00:14:49.17,00:14:49.17,I really want to putthe rest of the ice
357,00:14:51.37,00:14:51.37,"on top of the beer,but I'm so afraid."
358,00:14:53.43,00:14:53.43,Don't be afraid.Will you quit being afraid?
359,00:14:55.37,00:14:55.37,"ROB: Coming into this merger,"
360,00:14:56.73,00:14:56.73,it's interesting to seewhat everybody is doing.
361,00:14:59.67,00:14:59.67, Some people are busy building the shelter.
362,00:15:03.80,00:15:03.80," Other people, like myself, are busy building alliances"
363,00:15:07.33,00:15:07.33, and working towards the end of the game.
364,00:15:09.60,00:15:09.60," We'll see if you guys, that are building the shelter,"
365,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27, are all going to be here
366,00:15:13.77,00:15:13.77,to use it for more thansix or nine days.
367,00:15:18.63,00:15:18.63,But you understandwhat we have to do.
368,00:15:21.20,00:15:21.20,We have to start picking offthe stronger males.
369,00:15:23.47,00:15:23.47,"Yeah, but pleaselet Roger go first."
370,00:15:25.23,00:15:25.23,"-Please.-Oh, no, no, no."
371,00:15:26.40,00:15:26.40,"No. No, no."
372,00:15:27.57,00:15:27.57,I don't carewhat you want after that.
373,00:15:28.90,00:15:28.90,"But then after Roger, who?"
374,00:15:32.47,00:15:32.47,"I don't know,but he's gotta go."
375,00:15:34.43,00:15:34.43,Dave and Mattare the strongest men.
376,00:15:36.97,00:15:36.97,They're the most threatening.
377,00:15:38.07,00:15:38.07,"I know thatthey're both nice guys,"
378,00:15:39.60,00:15:39.60,but now it becomesa different game.
379,00:15:42.10,00:15:42.10,But Roger has got to go first.
380,00:15:43.53,00:15:43.53,"Because what will happen is,if he gets on the jury,"
381,00:15:45.87,00:15:45.87,"and then, say, just me or you--"
382,00:15:47.30,00:15:47.30,"okay, any of the girls--"
383,00:15:48.43,00:15:48.43,-he will vote against us.-Against.
384,00:15:49.67,00:15:49.67,So-- and there'sno doubt in my mind.
385,00:15:51.27,00:15:51.27,He is a hard-core maleall the way.
386,00:15:53.87,00:15:53.87,"DEENA: My initial thing was, let's get rid of Dave."
387,00:15:57.27,00:15:57.27," He clearly is one of the strongest,"
388,00:15:59.23,00:15:59.23, if not the strongest out here.
389,00:16:03.00,00:16:03.00,Jenna and Heidihad a good point--
390,00:16:05.27,00:16:05.27,"gotta give them their due--they said, ""Listen..."
391,00:16:07.47,00:16:07.47," if we were to allow Roger to be on the jury,"
392,00:16:11.30,00:16:11.30," he would never ever vote for a female."""
393,00:16:15.07,00:16:15.07," Simply because we have breasts and estrogen,"
394,00:16:16.77,00:16:16.77," we must be, somehow, so far inferior to that of a man."
395,00:16:21.07,00:16:21.07,They're right. Screw him.
396,00:16:22.70,00:16:22.70,"-Uh, we're, uh...-Uh, we'll need something else."
397,00:16:25.23,00:16:25.23,"-Just like old times, you know.-Yup."
398,00:16:26.97,00:16:26.97,The six of us building a sheltertogether. It...
399,00:16:29.27,00:16:29.27,"-Hey, guys. -Yeah, we were justtalking-- the guys"
400,00:16:31.20,00:16:31.20,"and I, and we thinkit's just a little too easy."
401,00:16:33.03,00:16:33.03,"We got six guys and four girls,and our original game plan was,"
402,00:16:36.57,00:16:36.57,"the six guys against...against the, uh..."
403,00:16:39.43,00:16:39.43,"against the girls,and, you know,"
404,00:16:42.37,00:16:42.37,"it should be,just pick 'em off."
405,00:16:43.83,00:16:43.83,And it just seems too easy.
406,00:16:46.23,00:16:46.23,"Uh, something probably is goingto happen here. I..."
407,00:16:50.13,00:16:50.13,I'm not that...I'm not that confident yet.
408,00:16:52.30,00:16:52.30,We'll see.
409,00:16:53.77,00:16:53.77,Yeah.
410,00:16:56.03,00:16:56.03,"DAVE: The initial plan, right now,"
411,00:16:57.70,00:16:57.70," is for the six guys to eliminate the four girls,"
412,00:17:01.90,00:17:01.90," and I am going to vote for Christy, because it seems"
413,00:17:05.60,00:17:05.60,that's the waythe old alliance is voting.
414,00:17:07.80,00:17:07.80," And if I were her, I'd be really worried,"
415,00:17:10.27,00:17:10.27, and I think Deena also saw herself in that position
416,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33," because she's been butting heads with Roger,"
417,00:17:14.27,00:17:14.27, and she knows that Roger
418,00:17:15.63,00:17:15.63,kind of has his allianceon one side.
419,00:17:17.80,00:17:17.80,(thunder rumbling)
420,00:17:20.33,00:17:20.33,(birds chirping)
421,00:17:28.00,00:17:28.00,Yeah.
422,00:17:29.23,00:17:29.23,"If we don't make it,we don't make it."
423,00:17:30.60,00:17:30.60,"This one we know doesn't reach,so go to this one?"
424,00:17:32.80,00:17:32.80,"ALEX: Roger is of the belief that we are all, um..."
425,00:17:35.40,00:17:35.40," all the guys are together and, um..."
426,00:17:38.80,00:17:38.80,"The fact of the matter is, um,Roger's first..."
427,00:17:41.17,00:17:41.17,"-Well, Roger's...-MATT: The second."
428,00:17:42.57,00:17:42.57,"-No, he's first on the list now.-MATT: Is he?"
429,00:17:44.37,00:17:44.37,-The list has changed.-MATT: Okay.
430,00:17:45.83,00:17:45.83,"He was being an ass earlier, soRoger's gonna be, uh, voted on."
431,00:17:48.43,00:17:48.43,"Unless he winsindividual immunity,"
432,00:17:49.67,00:17:49.67,he'll be the first one to go.
433,00:17:51.40,00:17:51.40,"Butch, don't forget your water."
434,00:17:53.43,00:17:53.43,BUTCH:What?
435,00:17:54.67,00:17:54.67,Don't forget your water.
436,00:17:56.00,00:17:56.00,"MATT: This is a tough game, and you have to"
437,00:17:58.47,00:17:58.47," identify people you can trust and stick with them,"
438,00:18:01.27,00:18:01.27, and we're very comfortable with our alliance.
439,00:18:04.20,00:18:04.20, We think it's going to hold true
440,00:18:05.97,00:18:05.97,to the end.
441,00:18:07.60,00:18:07.60,"-And then when it's thefive of us, uh... -Yeah."
442,00:18:09.80,00:18:09.80,...we'll sort it outamongst ourselves.
443,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,MATT:Exactly.
444,00:18:20.83,00:18:20.83,(all talking at once)
445,00:18:26.33,00:18:26.33,A can of beerand a cell phone.
446,00:18:28.33,00:18:28.33,-Can of beer...-(overlapping chatter)
447,00:18:30.87,00:18:30.87,-Particularly if we get soft.-Silver bullet.
448,00:18:33.37,00:18:33.37,"-Yeah, right here.-Cheers. -Cheers. -Salud."
449,00:18:35.30,00:18:35.30,To the ten.
450,00:18:36.37,00:18:36.37,-Jacaré.-ROB: Camp is very festive.
451,00:18:38.37,00:18:38.37, And everybody is hanging out except
452,00:18:40.37,00:18:40.37," for one man, who's passed out,"
453,00:18:43.37,00:18:43.37, sleeping and snoring.
454,00:18:45.40,00:18:45.40,And it happensto be the same guy
455,00:18:47.30,00:18:47.30,that everybody wantsto vote off.
456,00:18:49.40,00:18:49.40,-(snoring) -HEIDI: I wasso nervous coming here.
457,00:18:51.37,00:18:51.37,ROB: I'm disappointed that none of the girls are really
458,00:18:53.40,00:18:53.40, drinking that much. That's a problem
459,00:18:55.40,00:18:55.40, when you're a guy that looks like me.
460,00:18:57.90,00:18:57.90, I realize the only chance I have with either
461,00:18:59.40,00:18:59.40, of those two girls is if they get really drunk.
462,00:19:01.47,00:19:01.47,"But otherwise, it's stillpretty crazy in there."
463,00:19:05.00,00:19:05.00,Now where is the weirdest placethat you've ever had sex?
464,00:19:07.50,00:19:07.50,CHRISTY:I'd have to say
465,00:19:09.00,00:19:09.00,Fourth of Julyat the Washington Monument.
466,00:19:12.13,00:19:12.13,Fireworks.
467,00:19:13.60,00:19:13.60,Score. Yeah.
468,00:19:16.97,00:19:16.97,Not bad.
469,00:19:18.37,00:19:18.37,DAVE: We talked great sex talk last night.
470,00:19:20.53,00:19:20.53,"Just swapping stories like,like friends, uh, back home."
471,00:19:24.53,00:19:24.53,"So I'm back therewith these two chicks, and, uh,"
472,00:19:27.33,00:19:27.33,"I looked at this chick,and I'm, like,"
473,00:19:29.03,00:19:29.03,"""I dare you to eat this offof my stomach."""
474,00:19:31.17,00:19:31.17,"And she's, like, ""All right."""
475,00:19:32.73,00:19:32.73,"So you put the ice cubeon the belly,"
476,00:19:34.03,00:19:34.03,"gets eaten off. So she's, like,""Well, I dare you"
477,00:19:36.97,00:19:36.97,"to eat this out of my chest.""So I ate this ice cube"
478,00:19:39.07,00:19:39.07,"out of her chest,and then this one girl..."
479,00:19:41.17,00:19:41.17,ROB: I really dislike Dave.
480,00:19:43.07,00:19:43.07,"He thinks he's very slickand very smart,"
481,00:19:47.00,00:19:47.00,and he thinkshe's a real ladies' man.
482,00:19:50.40,00:19:50.40, So it's very possible that he could try to coerce
483,00:19:53.97,00:19:53.97," one of these girls into voting with him,"
484,00:19:55.60,00:19:55.60, and I just hope that all these girls
485,00:19:58.10,00:19:58.10, are solid enough to stand up
486,00:20:00.10,00:20:00.10,to this rocket scientist and hisstupid all-American charm.
487,00:20:04.40,00:20:04.40,Rob-a-sue...
488,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,"My-My, uh, sex life,if you even would call it that,"
489,00:20:10.23,00:20:10.23,is so... is so mundane.
490,00:20:12.63,00:20:12.63,"Like, I've got so many crazyideas in my head, that..."
491,00:20:15.93,00:20:15.93," Unfortunately, I don't have that many good sex stories."
492,00:20:19.13,00:20:19.13,I hardly haveany boring sex stories.
493,00:20:22.93,00:20:22.93, Most of my sex stories usually involve me and a fat girl.
494,00:20:26.63,00:20:26.63,"And then both girls were thereat the same time,"
495,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47,and it was really weirdthat both girls knew
496,00:20:31.30,00:20:31.30,that-that somethingwas going on.
497,00:20:32.53,00:20:32.53,"-And, uh, like, I was...-Dude, you were there."
498,00:20:35.17,00:20:35.17,"-Seal the deal, dude.-You had the opportunity."
499,00:20:37.00,00:20:37.00,-You gotta close... You gottaclose the deal. -Seal the deal.
500,00:20:39.00,00:20:39.00,"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure thegirls didn't like each other."
501,00:20:41.53,00:20:41.53,-Doesn't matter.-Doesn't matter.
502,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,"HEIDI: Yeah, I really, honestly,don't think it does."
503,00:20:44.47,00:20:44.47,You know what?
504,00:20:45.67,00:20:45.67,"Seriously, as a guy, I think"
505,00:20:47.00,00:20:47.00,"you'd be amazedhow many girls, if that..."
506,00:20:48.80,00:20:48.80,"if you saidthat's what you wanted to do,"
507,00:20:50.47,00:20:50.47,how quickly it would happen.
508,00:20:51.67,00:20:51.67,"-Wouldn't it, Jenna?-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."
509,00:20:53.00,00:20:53.00,"-Don't you think so? -Yeah.-Being a woman,"
510,00:20:54.90,00:20:54.90,-I think it would. -JENNA:I like two girls and a guy...
511,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,HEIDI:Two girls and a guy.
512,00:20:57.70,00:20:57.70,JENNA:I'd propose it to the guy.
513,00:20:58.87,00:20:58.87,"HEIDI: Never, nevertwo guys and a girl."
514,00:21:00.10,00:21:00.10,"JENNA: Or maybe justgirls together, but..."
515,00:21:01.60,00:21:01.60,"ROB: The way Jenna and Heidi were talking about threesomes,"
516,00:21:03.67,00:21:03.67,"I'm re-thinkingmy whole strategy,"
517,00:21:05.33,00:21:05.33,"so that the final three mightbe myself, Heidi and Jenna."
518,00:21:08.70,00:21:08.70," I could be having a threesome on Day 37 out here,"
519,00:21:12.23,00:21:12.23,and this would just be the most
520,00:21:14.67,00:21:14.67,incredible adventureof my life.
521,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,"-(snores) -All right,lights out, sports fans."
522,00:21:19.30,00:21:19.30,"-JENNA: Good night, all.-HEIDI: Good night."
523,00:21:20.63,00:21:20.63,"-Good night...-Good night, Jacaré."
524,00:21:21.90,00:21:21.90,"Good night, Rob Boy."
525,00:21:26.67,00:21:26.67,(birds squawking)
526,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,(clanking)
527,00:22:05.13,00:22:05.13,ROB: I don't know
528,00:22:07.93,00:22:07.93, why Roger started pushing everybody so hard.
529,00:22:11.50,00:22:11.50, The guy has no idea
530,00:22:13.10,00:22:13.10,how much of a jerk he is.
531,00:22:15.70,00:22:15.70, He has no sense of self-awareness
532,00:22:17.10,00:22:17.10, that he can determine that people don't like him.
533,00:22:21.17,00:22:21.17,Nobody likes him.
534,00:22:22.80,00:22:22.80,So how many people are gonnavote against Roger-- seven?
535,00:22:25.07,00:22:25.07,Seven against three?
536,00:22:27.63,00:22:27.63,"Oh, if Rog is gone,I'll be so happy."
537,00:22:30.83,00:22:30.83,"And I'm just gonna keep-keepkissing his ass the whole time,"
538,00:22:34.10,00:22:34.10,so he doesn't suspect a thing.
539,00:22:36.13,00:22:36.13,Are we still gonnabe able to get-get Dave?
540,00:22:37.67,00:22:37.67,"Dave's second, you bet."
541,00:22:39.00,00:22:39.00,Dave-Dave is so charismaticthat it just scares...
542,00:22:41.10,00:22:41.10,scares me to death.
543,00:22:42.47,00:22:42.47,DEENA: Because the girls arepissed off that they think
544,00:22:45.27,00:22:45.27,that we are so stupid
545,00:22:46.60,00:22:46.60,that we haven't been planningsince day one.
546,00:22:48.37,00:22:48.37,-ROB: Okay.-(Deena scoffs) Ugh!
547,00:22:50.20,00:22:50.20,"DEENA: Rob chose me, and I..."
548,00:22:53.93,00:22:53.93,I can honestly saythat it's Rob and I
549,00:22:56.70,00:22:56.70,that have engineeredthis whole turnaround.
550,00:22:58.80,00:22:58.80,"And it is not the battleof the sexes anymore,"
551,00:23:01.67,00:23:01.67,but it's the battle ofthe weaker versus the stronger.
552,00:23:04.53,00:23:04.53,And they're so stinking cocky.
553,00:23:06.20,00:23:06.20,I hate that.
554,00:23:08.07,00:23:08.07,Never underestimatethe power of a woman.
555,00:23:10.07,00:23:10.07,-Yeah.-Ever.
556,00:23:13.27,00:23:13.27,Silly boys.
557,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13,Games are for girls.
558,00:23:16.53,00:23:16.53,ROB: As long as one boy getsto come along in this game.
559,00:23:19.37,00:23:19.37,"Top three, baby, right here."
560,00:23:21.00,00:23:21.00,Boom.
561,00:23:23.97,00:23:23.97,"You, me and Jenna."
562,00:23:25.70,00:23:25.70,ROB:Okay.
563,00:23:27.53,00:23:27.53,"And then, of course,it's every girl for himself."
564,00:23:29.80,00:23:29.80,(Rob laughs)
565,00:23:31.43,00:23:31.43,"Oh, yeah!"
566,00:23:34.90,00:23:34.90,Dave's your daddy.
567,00:23:37.83,00:23:37.83,"Oh, look there--he's got another one."
568,00:23:39.47,00:23:39.47,"-(Jenna mutters)-DEENA: Oh, look at that."
569,00:23:41.70,00:23:41.70,"Deena, we have a chanceof being really, really close."
570,00:23:43.83,00:23:43.83,I know. I want to goall the way to the final three.
571,00:23:46.50,00:23:46.50,"We have to work it outto our benefit,"
572,00:23:48.47,00:23:48.47,'cause you haveto understand Alex has a...
573,00:23:50.17,00:23:50.17,an alliance with Rob.
574,00:23:51.80,00:23:51.80,"I would rather take him outof the picture,"
575,00:23:53.80,00:23:53.80,and force Rob to come with us.
576,00:23:55.10,00:23:55.10,-Do you understandwhat I'm saying? -Yes.
577,00:23:57.20,00:23:57.20,How's it doing?
578,00:23:58.77,00:23:58.77,-Eleven.-DEENA: Oh.
579,00:24:00.33,00:24:00.33,Outstanding. What kind?
580,00:24:01.87,00:24:01.87,"MATT:Catfish,"
581,00:24:03.23,00:24:03.23,"some sort of herring,and a piranha."
582,00:24:06.40,00:24:06.40,-So everybody gets a fish?-Yup. -Yup.
583,00:24:08.37,00:24:08.37,MATT:And then some.
584,00:24:10.43,00:24:10.43,I may never winindividual immunity.
585,00:24:12.43,00:24:12.43,"I may not, either."
586,00:24:13.77,00:24:13.77,-But it doesn't matter.-Doesn't matter.
587,00:24:15.90,00:24:15.90,Doesn't matter.
588,00:24:17.47,00:24:17.47,"DEENA: Roger, Butch and Dave think"
589,00:24:19.10,00:24:19.10, that they have this game sewn up.
590,00:24:22.57,00:24:22.57,"Sorry. There was an Adam,and then there was an Eve."
591,00:24:25.53,00:24:25.53,"And do you remember, Eve justkind of took Adam right along"
592,00:24:28.30,00:24:28.30,with the rest of the boat.
593,00:24:29.43,00:24:29.43,Oh!
594,00:24:30.70,00:24:30.70,DEENA:And that's what we're gonna do.
595,00:24:32.63,00:24:32.63," We're gonna play 'em, we're gonna play 'em hard,"
596,00:24:34.10,00:24:34.10, because we're gonna beat them at their own game.
597,00:24:35.97,00:24:35.97, You can't be cocky and just assume
598,00:24:37.33,00:24:37.33, that girls are gonna lie down
599,00:24:38.70,00:24:38.70,"and let it all happen, and""Gosh, thanks, that was so good."
600,00:24:41.43,00:24:41.43,"You guys are such good players.Congratulations."""
601,00:24:43.37,00:24:43.37,No. Game is mine.
602,00:24:45.83,00:24:45.83,"Roger is gone,"

806,00:34:21.30,00:34:21.30, And it looks as though it-it's...
807,00:34:23.53,00:34:23.53," everything is falling into place,"
808,00:34:25.57,00:34:25.57, exactly like we planned it.
809,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83," Uh, you know,"
810,00:34:28.10,00:34:28.10,and I'm sitting heresaying it's...
811,00:34:29.70,00:34:29.70,it's too good to be true.
812,00:34:31.50,00:34:31.50,"HEIDI:I'm sitting there thinking,"
813,00:34:32.80,00:34:32.80,"""Where's the effingpeanut butter? I'm..."
814,00:34:34.13,00:34:34.13,"I'm going to grindthe peanuts myself."""
815,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80,"I was like, ""Jeff, getthese girls some peanut butter!"""
816,00:34:38.77,00:34:38.77,(laughter)
817,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,We are definitely the original
818,00:34:41.60,00:34:41.60, -Survivor Girls Gone Wild.-HEIDI: Yeah.
819,00:34:42.90,00:34:42.90,"-Yeah, definitely.-There's no doubt about it."
820,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20,HEIDI:We are the Amazon chicks.
821,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,"-So, really...-Gee, and-and the..."
822,00:34:46.93,00:34:46.93,"oh, what makes iteven more funny,"
823,00:34:48.37,00:34:48.37,is the guys think thatthey're slowly picking us off.
824,00:34:50.20,00:34:50.20,-Yes. Yes.-Which is so...
825,00:34:51.27,00:34:51.27,And they're being
826,00:34:52.27,00:34:52.27, so nice to me and Heidi.
827,00:34:53.37,00:34:53.37," They're like, ""You know what?"
828,00:34:54.47,00:34:54.47,"You're going to go eventually."""
829,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83," -And we're like, ""Aw..."" -HEIDI: Yeah."
830,00:34:57.17,00:34:57.17,"HEIDI: ""We'll try to spare you."
831,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17," We'll try to spare you guys."""
832,00:34:59.73,00:34:59.73,"JENNA: Yeah, and we're, like, ""You guys are so sweet."""
833,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,Especially with... with Roger.
834,00:35:03.53,00:35:03.53,"-Oh... oh.-I mean, he could've... he..."
835,00:35:04.93,00:35:04.93,he thinks that he'sjust got it in the bag.
836,00:35:06.87,00:35:06.87,(thunder rumbling)
837,00:35:14.53,00:35:14.53,Nothing we can do about it now.
838,00:35:15.80,00:35:15.80,DAVE: I think that all four of the females
839,00:35:19.17,00:35:19.17," realize that they are going to be quickly eliminated,"
840,00:35:24.20,00:35:24.20, because the six males are starting
841,00:35:26.17,00:35:26.17, to stick together a little bit better.
842,00:35:28.20,00:35:28.20, I don't think that they're surprised that...
843,00:35:31.77,00:35:31.77,four girls and six guys--
844,00:35:34.23,00:35:34.23,they're looking to go packingpretty quick.
845,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03,"We're on, guys."
846,00:35:39.07,00:35:39.07,"And that pothas been boiled, huh?"
847,00:35:41.30,00:35:41.30,ROB: I realized early on that the other men
848,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90, that I was dealt with are a bunch of jamokes.
849,00:35:48.20,00:35:48.20, They have no idea that the women are capable
850,00:35:50.07,00:35:50.07, of taking them all out at this point in the game.
851,00:35:52.93,00:35:52.93, I will go as far as to say
852,00:35:54.50,00:35:54.50, that I know that I'm going to be
853,00:35:55.70,00:35:55.70, the last man standing in this game.
854,00:35:58.03,00:35:58.03, And I don't think
855,00:35:59.43,00:35:59.43,any of the other men
856,00:36:01.00,00:36:01.00,have any ideawhat's going on around them.
857,00:36:23.30,00:36:23.30,Okay.
858,00:36:24.83,00:36:24.83,"Last time I saw you guys,"
859,00:36:26.27,00:36:26.27,"before the challenge,you were heading out"
860,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,in a new boat as one tribe.
861,00:36:29.47,00:36:29.47,"Butch, what was the new tribe'sfirst order of business?"
862,00:36:33.10,00:36:33.10,"Well, what we wantedto do first was, of course,"
863,00:36:34.90,00:36:34.90,establish a...a place of residency.
864,00:36:36.20,00:36:36.20,"And, uh, we felt itwas important... at least I felt"
865,00:36:38.53,00:36:38.53,it was importantto include everybody
866,00:36:40.30,00:36:40.30,and everybody's opinion.
867,00:36:41.87,00:36:41.87,So I say we all came togetheras a team.
868,00:36:43.60,00:36:43.60,"Is that accurate, Rob?"
869,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,Was it pretty inclusive?
870,00:36:45.93,00:36:45.93,Everybody had a...a part to play.
871,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,"If you didn't know what youwere particularly good at,"
872,00:36:50.77,00:36:50.77,there was a couple peoplethat were more than happy
873,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,to tell youwhere you should be going
874,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,and what you should be doing.
875,00:36:55.97,00:36:55.97,"And, uh, we did get the shelterup pretty quickly,"
876,00:36:58.07,00:36:58.07,so I guess it worked.
877,00:36:59.37,00:36:59.37,"PROBST: Okay, I'll readbetween the lines."
878,00:37:01.10,00:37:01.10,There were a couple of peoplemore than willing
879,00:37:03.03,00:37:03.03,to tell you what to do.
880,00:37:04.77,00:37:04.77,"Are you sayingthere were bossy people quickly,"
881,00:37:06.70,00:37:06.70,or are you sayingyou like being subservient
882,00:37:08.77,00:37:08.77,to people who decide what to do?
883,00:37:10.07,00:37:10.07,I like being subservient
884,00:37:11.30,00:37:11.30,to the people that decidewhat to do.
885,00:37:13.43,00:37:13.43,"PROBST: Deena, did any womenviably participate"
886,00:37:16.30,00:37:16.30,in building the shelter?
887,00:37:17.37,00:37:17.37,Putting the logs together
888,00:37:18.87,00:37:18.87,with the four cornersof the foundation? No.
889,00:37:21.60,00:37:21.60,But you know what?We so had the opportunity
890,00:37:24.33,00:37:24.33,"to re-bond with one another,"
891,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,and I think thatis so far more important
892,00:37:27.50,00:37:27.50,than putting together thefour corners of the structure.
893,00:37:29.57,00:37:29.57,"PROBST:Roger, you've got"
894,00:37:30.93,00:37:30.93,a real smug lookon your face right now.
895,00:37:33.43,00:37:33.43,"You can have too many Indians,in this case,"
896,00:37:36.83,00:37:36.83,creating a structure.
897,00:37:37.93,00:37:37.93,"I mean, if there were morethan four of us"
898,00:37:39.90,00:37:39.90,"putting together the foundation,it wouldn't have worked,"
899,00:37:41.80,00:37:41.80,"but, uh, it-it was goingto be done that way, regardless."
900,00:37:44.80,00:37:44.80,"I mean, it was importantfor the new tribe to establish"
901,00:37:47.93,00:37:47.93,"a very, uh, strong and stableshelter as quickly as we could."
902,00:37:52.37,00:37:52.37,"Jenna, let's talkabout the challenge today."
903,00:37:55.37,00:37:55.37,Okay.
904,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,"Well, certainly, you and Heidi"
905,00:37:59.07,00:37:59.07,provided a highlightat the challenge.
906,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,"Aside from the fact that yougot naked for peanut butter,"
907,00:38:04.07,00:38:04.07,"you guys jumped off that perch,"
908,00:38:06.03,00:38:06.03,"first two,and it wasn't very long in."
909,00:38:07.97,00:38:07.97,We're playing for immunity.
910,00:38:09.23,00:38:09.23,"Where does the confidencecome from to say,"
911,00:38:11.40,00:38:11.40,"""I'm really not worried?"""
912,00:38:12.63,00:38:12.63,If one of usgets kicked off tonight
913,00:38:14.60,00:38:14.60,"because we jumped offfor peanut butter and cookies,"
914,00:38:17.10,00:38:17.10,"-it was still worth it'cause it was fun, -Yeah. Yeah."
915,00:38:20.33,00:38:20.33,"-and it was really, really good.-I totally agree."
916,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,"Now, Roger,you weren't long after."
917,00:38:24.90,00:38:24.90,"Yeah. Yeah, and I rationalizedthe whole thing."
918,00:38:27.70,00:38:27.70,"""Hey, I'm not going to winimmunity on this,"
919,00:38:30.40,00:38:30.40,"so I might as welljust jump in."""
920,00:38:32.67,00:38:32.67,"Would it have been differentfor you,"
921,00:38:34.40,00:38:34.40,"knowing that you didn't feelyou could win,"
922,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,but you knew you needed it?
923,00:38:37.83,00:38:37.83,Would you have hungin there longer?
924,00:38:39.57,00:38:39.57,"Obviously, if I really feltthat I needed that immunity,"
925,00:38:43.60,00:38:43.60,I would've given it my all.Yes.
926,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,"Deena, you are the only onewho cannot be voted for tonight,"
927,00:38:50.40,00:38:50.40,"but because you havethat immunity around your neck,"
928,00:38:53.40,00:38:53.40,if you thoughtthere was somebody
929,00:38:54.83,00:38:54.83,"that needed protecting tonight,"
930,00:38:56.27,00:38:56.27,you can assign that immunityto somebody else.
931,00:38:58.90,00:38:58.90,I choose not to.
932,00:39:00.43,00:39:00.43,I choose to assign it to myself.
933,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,PROBST:It is time to vote.

937,00:39:24.90,00:39:24.90, and you definitely would not have received my vote.
938,00:39:27.47,00:39:27.47,You've contributed greatlyto the tribe.
939,00:39:39.33,00:39:39.33,Reality check and mate.
