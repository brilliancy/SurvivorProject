308,00:17:40.79,00:17:40.79,"To hear that there were steaksup for grabs was tough because,"

329,00:18:52.96,00:18:52.96,>> I think it's really crazy togive Russell the idol.
330,00:18:56.25,00:18:56.25,You don't know what's going onover there.
331,00:18:58.29,00:18:58.29,He could be in with the girlsfor all we know.

333,00:19:03.79,00:19:03.79,"idea?I mean, it could give us the"

338,00:19:52.04,00:19:52.04,Danielle and I woke up thismorning and we're like quiet
339,00:19:54.58,00:19:54.58,little mice running aroundbecause there's an immunity
340,00:19:57.08,00:19:57.08,idol hidden at our camp and wedidn't want Russell to see us.
341,00:20:01.04,00:20:01.04,">> Dancing... tree.>> It's those right there, right"
342,00:20:04.88,00:20:04.88,there.You think?
343,00:20:08.12,00:20:08.12,>> Yeah.Yeah.
344,00:20:11.08,00:20:11.08,>> They look like they'redancing.
345,00:20:12.71,00:20:12.71,"All right, so I guess look righthere."
346,00:20:14.79,00:20:14.79,>> Yeah.It could be behind this.
347,00:20:25.33,00:20:25.33,"It could be over here, too.>> (laughing): Oh, my God."
348,00:20:41.17,00:20:41.17,">> What?>> Oh, my God, we just found"
349,00:20:43.67,00:20:43.67,"that in, like, four seconds.Here, hold this so I can cover"
350,00:20:46.71,00:20:46.71,it up.>> Nice.
351,00:20:50.50,00:20:50.50,>> We found the idol.I am the happiest girl in the
352,00:20:54.50,00:20:54.50,world that I found that idolbecause it gives me control of
353,00:20:57.83,00:20:57.83,the game right now.This is a big deal.
354,00:21:02.38,00:21:02.38,"Oh, my God, I can't believe wehave that."
355,00:21:04.92,00:21:04.92,And I'm not going to tellRussell about the idol right
356,00:21:06.71,00:21:06.71,now.I want Russell to be out of the
357,00:21:09.00,00:21:09.00,loop for a little bit.I don't see anything wrong with
358,00:21:11.08,00:21:11.08,making him wait.I really don't.
359,00:21:12.25,00:21:12.25,It doesn't mean I don't trusthim.
360,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,It's just...I kind of want to see him squirm
361,00:21:16.38,00:21:16.38,a little bit.It's fun.
362,00:21:20.42,00:21:20.42,(both laugh)It's not all Russell running the
363,00:21:23.75,00:21:23.75,show around here.He is not the king of Survivor.
364,00:21:27.00,00:21:27.00,I'm the queen.(laughs)
365,00:21:29.58,00:21:29.58,"And usually the king does whatthe queen says anyway, so I'm"
366,00:21:33.71,00:21:33.71,cool.>> You're writing your letter to
367,00:21:58.54,00:21:58.54,"Russell, buddy?>> Yep."
368,00:22:04.79,00:22:04.79,"""Russell, this is a huge turningpoint in this game."
369,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,This is not fake.I wouldn't waste your time
370,00:22:10.17,00:22:10.17,or mine.Just by competing against you
371,00:22:12.75,00:22:12.75,"and the few handshakes we'vehad, I feel like I can"
372,00:22:14.79,00:22:14.79,trust you.Play the idol tonight and
373,00:22:16.96,00:22:16.96,save yourself.All the girls should be writing
374,00:22:19.21,00:22:19.21,"your name down, so act like youknow you're going home."
375,00:22:21.79,00:22:21.79,I think you should writeParvati's name down to send
376,00:22:24.46,00:22:24.46,her home.We will most likely merge at
377,00:22:27.08,00:22:27.08,"ten people, and then you willbe completely safe with us."
378,00:22:30.00,00:22:30.00,Our five plus you will remainstrong until the girls are
379,00:22:32.42,00:22:32.42,done with.We can then work on getting

570,00:33:01.17,00:33:01.17,>> So are they gonna vote for meor Sandra?
571,00:33:03.38,00:33:03.38,">> I don't know.I don't know what to do, because"

573,00:33:08.00,00:33:08.00,">> I know.I mean, the only thing I can say"
574,00:33:10.50,00:33:10.50,"to you is that if we have five,and if I'm there, Amanda is more"
575,00:33:13.46,00:33:13.46,likely to come with us.>> Yeah.
576,00:33:15.46,00:33:15.46,>> Because she trusts me.Do you know what I mean?
577,00:33:17.46,00:33:17.46,>> Mm-hmm.>> That's my only perk.
578,00:33:19.46,00:33:19.46,"'Cause I would stay with you.Well, whatever."
579,00:33:21.46,00:33:21.46,That's my argument for me.I'm not going to throw Sandra
580,00:33:23.46,00:33:23.46,"under the bus.I wouldn't vote for her, either."
581,00:33:25.46,00:33:25.46,"So I'm just going to vote forJerri, I guess, and whatever"
582,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,"happens, happens.>> Look, you would definitely"
583,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,stay with me?>> Yeah.
584,00:33:34.04,00:33:34.04,">> Things are going to go crazyas soon as we merge, because"
585,00:33:37.54,00:33:37.54,it's five-five.As long as I know you'll stick
586,00:33:40.12,00:33:40.12,"with me, then I'll do what I cando to keep you."
587,00:33:43.00,00:33:43.00,>> I'm... I'm...>> But you have to be with me.
588,00:33:45.25,00:33:45.25,(laughter)Courtney and I have become

603,00:34:28.21,00:34:28.21,"thing, which is why I want totalk to you about Courtney,"
604,00:34:30.96,00:34:30.96,because I think we need to keepCourtney tonight.
605,00:34:35.08,00:34:35.08,">> Yeah.>> I just think, Courtney would"
606,00:34:37.08,00:34:37.08,be more likely to stick with usthan Sandra.
607,00:34:39.08,00:34:39.08,Do you trust that you haveSandra's loyalty?
608,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,>> I don't trust Courtney atall.
609,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,"I-I think she'll flip, and thenall of a sudden..."
610,00:34:45.08,00:34:45.08,>> I-I think Sandra will flipway before Courtney.
611,00:34:46.92,00:34:46.92,">> All of a sudden, they have,uh..."
612,00:34:48.71,00:34:48.71,">> And she's more strategic.>> I think they'll both flip, so"
613,00:34:50.62,00:34:50.62,it just comes down to who's morethreatening...
614,00:34:52.42,00:34:52.42,">> All of a sudden, you gotAmanda talking to you."
615,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,>> ...as far as who can talkbetter-- Sandra or Courtney?
616,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83,">> Sandra, and who makes up liesfor no reason?"
617,00:34:57.62,00:34:57.62,>> I just think Courtney isway more likely to go flip-flop.
618,00:35:00.00,00:35:00.00,">> But then you have to look at,like, if she gets to the end,"
619,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,Sandra would be harder to beatthan Courtney.
620,00:35:04.08,00:35:04.08,>> Courtney would be easierto stick to...
621,00:35:06.08,00:35:06.08,>> To keep track of.>> To keep track of.
