1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:03.75,00:00:03.75,Survivor: Although there were only five
3,00:00:06.62,00:00:06.62,"Heroes left, they appeared to be a tight-knit group."
4,00:00:09.62,00:00:09.62,>> Best team on Survivor right here.
5,00:00:11.17,00:00:11.17,>> PROBST: But their unity was only an illusion because when
6,00:00:13.50,00:00:13.50,"J.T. found a hidden immunity idol, Amanda and Candice decided"
7,00:00:17.54,00:00:17.54,he wasn't as trustworthy as they thought.
8,00:00:19.79,00:00:19.79,>> J.T.'s the slimiest guy out here.
9,00:00:21.92,00:00:21.92,>> PROBST: The Heroes had also convinced themselves that the
10,00:00:24.25,00:00:24.25,Villains tribe was completely controlled by women.
11,00:00:26.62,00:00:26.62,>> Sure looks like they got a woman's alliance.
12,00:00:29.08,00:00:29.08,>> PROBST: But there was no women's alliance.
13,00:00:31.00,00:00:31.00,>> The Hero tribe thinks this is an all-girl alliance.
14,00:00:33.58,00:00:33.58,"They think I'm on the outside, when I'm the leader."
15,00:00:36.50,00:00:36.50,">> PROBST: In fact, two of the women, Sandra and Courtney, were"
16,00:00:39.38,00:00:39.38,in the greatest danger. >> We're the ones on the outs.
17,00:00:42.04,00:00:42.04,>> PROBST: When the Villains lost their fourth challenge
18,00:00:43.83,00:00:43.83,in a row... Heroes win immunity!
19,00:00:46.50,00:00:46.50,(Heroes cheer) ...Courtney was the next to go.
20,00:00:49.08,00:00:49.08,But Sandra made a brilliant move to save her friend.
21,00:00:51.50,00:00:51.50,She convinced Russell that Coach had turned on him.
22,00:00:56.25,00:00:56.25,>> Russell's so stupid. He ate that crap up.
23,00:01:00.62,00:01:00.62,">> PROBST: Her plan worked. Courtney was spared,"
24,00:01:03.25,00:01:03.25,"and Coach was voted out... Coach, the tribe has spoken."
25,00:01:06.12,00:01:06.12,...leaving Jerri without her closest ally.
26,00:01:09.25,00:01:09.25,11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
27,00:01:24.08,00:01:24.08,We went to Tribal Council and we went ahead and voted out
28,00:01:28.21,00:01:28.21,Coach because I told Russell that Coach was going to vote
29,00:01:30.92,00:01:30.92,for him. And that's why Coach is probably
30,00:01:34.96,00:01:34.96,now out there looking into the sky wondering where everything
31,00:01:37.33,00:01:37.33,went wrong. >> I didn't see that coming
32,00:01:41.08,00:01:41.08,at all. I had no idea that Coach was
33,00:01:43.17,00:01:43.17,gonna go tonight. Not a clue.
34,00:01:46.21,00:01:46.21,"I'm not next, am I? >> No way, no way, no way."
35,00:01:49.54,00:01:49.54,">> Oh, God. >> You have my word."
36,00:01:51.25,00:01:51.25,"I will not write your name down, I promise you that."
37,00:01:54.04,00:01:54.04,"Obviously, it was last-minute, and I didn't want to tell you"
38,00:01:56.46,00:01:56.46,'cause I didn't want to freak you out.
39,00:01:58.75,00:01:58.75,>> Okay. >> Don't worry.
40,00:02:00.83,00:02:00.83,>> Yeah... I don't want to be next.
41,00:02:03.12,00:02:03.12,>> You're not going to. (Jerri laughs)
42,00:02:05.12,00:02:05.12,>> Coach was my one and only serious alliance.
43,00:02:08.54,00:02:08.54,"I mean, he's the only person out here I trusted, so I'm still"
44,00:02:11.96,00:02:11.96,going to stick true to the alliance that I created with
45,00:02:14.67,00:02:14.67,"Russell, Parvati and Danielle, but at this point, that's all I"
46,00:02:17.38,00:02:17.38,"got. >> So, what happened?"
47,00:02:23.33,00:02:23.33,>> You didn't know it was going to happen?
48,00:02:25.88,00:02:25.88,>> I had a strong feeling that I wasn't going to write his name
49,00:02:28.50,00:02:28.50,down. Coach betrayed me by telling
50,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,Sandra that he was trying to blindside me tonight.
51,00:02:34.38,00:02:34.38,>> I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't next...
52,00:02:36.96,00:02:36.96,">> No, I... I promise you, you ain't next."
53,00:02:39.04,00:02:39.04,">> Okay. >> You see, we got five girls"
54,00:02:42.67,00:02:42.67,"on my tribe now. I feel great about it, because"
55,00:02:45.08,00:02:45.08,I trust three of them. But I don't trust Sandra and
56,00:02:49.42,00:02:49.42,"Courtney, so they'll be the next to go."
57,00:02:52.38,00:02:52.38,I promise you that. (theme song playing)
58,00:03:32.62,00:03:32.62,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Treemail!
59,00:04:02.12,00:04:02.12,>> Yeah. >> Treemail. Treemail.
60,00:04:04.12,00:04:04.12,">> Oh, what is this? >> ""Your next reward challenge"
61,00:04:09.04,00:04:09.04,requires endurance and a threshold for pain.
62,00:04:11.79,00:04:11.79,You would have seen this challenge in Survivor: 
63,00:04:13.88,00:04:13.88,Tocantins. Each survivor will position
64,00:04:16.21,00:04:16.21,"themselves between two narrow walls, their feet perched on a"
65,00:04:18.58,00:04:18.58,"small foothold."" >> Hmm."
66,00:04:20.58,00:04:20.58,">> ""This time, you will each be paired against a member of the"
67,00:04:23.17,00:04:23.17,other tribe. Below you must rank your five
68,00:04:25.21,00:04:25.21,competitors from strongest to weakest.
69,00:04:27.33,00:04:27.33,This will determine who you match up against-- the person
70,00:04:29.42,00:04:29.42,"with the same ranking from the other tribe."""
71,00:04:31.71,00:04:31.71,">> Coach screamed at the end of his, and was, like... (yelling)"
72,00:04:34.04,00:04:34.04,(laughter) >> He did.
73,00:04:36.04,00:04:36.04,">> Jumped off, you guys. >> Strongest. I'm obviously the"
74,00:04:38.04,00:04:38.04,"strongest, but I'm the heaviest, too."
75,00:04:40.08,00:04:40.08,>> I think maybe all the girls should play.
76,00:04:42.17,00:04:42.17,>> Yeah. >> We have little feet.
77,00:04:44.17,00:04:44.17,We're lighter. >> So do I.
78,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,">> I think we have an upper hand against them, five women."
79,00:04:48.17,00:04:48.17,>> So do I. >> Me and Danielle both won
80,00:04:50.17,00:04:50.17,our endurance challenge. >> They're going to put all the
81,00:04:52.17,00:04:52.17,"guys at the top, 'cause it says, put your strongest to your"
82,00:04:54.29,00:04:54.29,"weakest, and, you know, they're guys with big egos."
83,00:04:59.04,00:04:59.04,>> I'll be able to do great at this.
84,00:05:01.12,00:05:01.12,>> You think you're going to do the best?
85,00:05:03.12,00:05:03.12,">> Yeah. >> The bigger you are, the"
86,00:05:05.12,00:05:05.12,harder it is. >> If you guys want to put me
87,00:05:07.12,00:05:07.12,"weakest, that's fine. >> No, no, no."
88,00:05:09.12,00:05:09.12,">> I'll tell you the weakest if you're too proud to take it,"
89,00:05:11.12,00:05:11.12,though. (Rupert laughs)
90,00:05:13.12,00:05:13.12,>> I think I'm the strongest of all 11 of us still left out
91,00:05:15.21,00:05:15.21,"here, but if they want to rank me as the weakest, I'll let"
92,00:05:19.79,00:05:19.79,"them. >> Last time, the bigger people"
93,00:05:22.62,00:05:22.62,went out first. >> Right.
94,00:05:24.67,00:05:24.67,">> I mean, small girls with small feet are really what can"
95,00:05:27.17,00:05:27.17,do really well at it. >> I would love to see all five
96,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,"of us still up there, and three of them just drop out."
97,00:05:32.33,00:05:32.33,(Rupert laughs) Just to make a... make a
98,00:05:34.62,00:05:34.62,"statement. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
99,00:05:49.88,00:05:49.88,Heroes getting your first look at the new Villain tribe.
100,00:05:54.42,00:05:54.42,">> PROBST: Coach voted out at the last Tribal Council, and"
101,00:05:56.67,00:05:56.67,Coach became the first member of our jury.
102,00:06:01.46,00:06:01.46,"Rupert, what's the reaction to seeing it's Coach that is now"
103,00:06:04.08,00:06:04.08,gone from the game? >> Phew!
104,00:06:06.08,00:06:06.08,"Cannot believe Coach is gone, you know."
105,00:06:08.50,00:06:08.50,But that women's alliance looks very strong.
106,00:06:10.83,00:06:10.83,"It's kind of obvious. >> PROBST: J.T., obvious to you"
107,00:06:13.42,00:06:13.42,guys it's a woman's alliance? >> I would have bet my life
108,00:06:15.75,00:06:15.75,Russell or Coach-- one was going to be gone.
109,00:06:18.08,00:06:18.08,">> PROBST: All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward"
110,00:06:20.25,00:06:20.25,challenge? (all voicing assent)
111,00:06:22.25,00:06:22.25,"For today's challenge, you will use your arms to brace yourself"
112,00:06:26.08,00:06:26.08,between two walls while your bare feet are perched on very
113,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,"narrow footholds. Every ten minutes, you will move"
114,00:06:34.08,00:06:34.08,to an even smaller foothold. Once you reach the third and
115,00:06:37.38,00:06:37.38,"final foothold, you will stay there for as long as you can."
116,00:06:40.50,00:06:40.50,Each person will be matched up against someone from the
117,00:06:43.62,00:06:43.62,opposite tribe. All you have to do to score a
118,00:06:46.62,00:06:46.62,point-- outlast your opponent. First tribe to score three
119,00:06:50.12,00:06:50.12,points wins reward. >> PROBST: Want to know what
120,00:06:55.67,00:06:55.67,your playing for? (all voicing assent)
121,00:06:57.67,00:06:57.67,"Well, it's clear you all like to live adventurously, so let me"
122,00:07:00.62,00:07:00.62,tell you what is at stake. The winning tribe will receive
123,00:07:03.75,00:07:03.75,a feast from Outback Steakhouse. >> ALL: Oh!
124,00:07:09.83,00:07:09.83,">> Bloomin' onion, baby! >> PROBST: Steak, shrimp on the"
125,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,barbie... >> Oh!
126,00:07:14.08,00:07:14.08,>> PROBST: ...loaded baked potato with all the fixings.
127,00:07:18.62,00:07:18.62,"So much food from Outback Steakhouse, you will not be able"
128,00:07:21.42,00:07:21.42,to eat it all. (Rupert laughs)
129,00:07:23.75,00:07:23.75,"This morning in your treemail, you were asked to rank your"
130,00:07:27.00,00:07:27.00,"tribe to determine our matchups, and in doing so, Villains, you"
131,00:07:30.12,00:07:30.12,decided who you were sitting out.
132,00:07:32.17,00:07:32.17,Russell sitting out this challenge.
133,00:07:34.17,00:07:34.17,"Take a spot on the bench. Everybody else, take your"
134,00:07:36.29,00:07:36.29,"positions, and we'll get started."
135,00:07:47.25,00:07:47.25,Some interesting match-ups. Danielle and Candice.
136,00:07:49.71,00:07:49.71,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Courtney taking on
137,00:07:51.88,00:07:51.88,"Amanda. Parvati taking on J.T., who won"
138,00:07:55.08,00:07:55.08,"this in the Tocantins. >> Hey, Colby."
139,00:07:57.46,00:07:57.46,">> Hi, Jerri. >> PROBST: A rematch-- Jerri"
140,00:07:59.46,00:07:59.46,"Manthey, Colby Donaldson-- going all the way back to season two."
141,00:08:05.08,00:08:05.08,And another rematch-- Sandra and Rupert going back to the Pearl
142,00:08:09.12,00:08:09.12,"Islands, our seventh season. >> Love you."
143,00:08:12.38,00:08:12.38,>> PROBST: Go ahead and head on up.
144,00:08:14.75,00:08:14.75,"First round is ten minutes. You can't use your back, your"
145,00:08:18.29,00:08:18.29,"butt, your hips, your shoulders. Forearms are totally fine."
146,00:08:21.96,00:08:21.96,"If you want to lean your head against it, if that helps,"
147,00:08:24.38,00:08:24.38,that's okay. Everybody's looking good right
148,00:08:26.38,00:08:26.38,now. (Jerri exhales loudly)
149,00:08:28.38,00:08:28.38,"This challenge is officially on. Both ranked your tribe,"
150,00:08:32.88,00:08:32.88,"theoretically, from strongest to weakest, but judging from the"
151,00:08:37.96,00:08:37.96,"fact that J.T. is in the middle, I'm guessing there was some"
152,00:08:40.96,00:08:40.96,"strategy about who the other tribe was going to put up, and"
153,00:08:43.58,00:08:43.58,that affected the positions you chose.
154,00:08:47.08,00:08:47.08,"Since you're resting comfortably early on in this challenge, we"
155,00:08:51.17,00:08:51.17,have a little bit of a celebration to note.
156,00:08:54.08,00:08:54.08,Today marks the one hundredth day that Amanda has played
157,00:08:58.25,00:08:58.25,Survivor. First person to get to 100 days.
158,00:09:01.71,00:09:01.71,">> Yay! >> You go, girl."
159,00:09:15.54,00:09:15.54,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to move down to the next smaller"
160,00:09:19.42,00:09:19.42,"foothold. Five, four..."
161,00:09:24.08,00:09:24.08,"three, two, one. Everybody looks good."
162,00:09:30.79,00:09:30.79,"All you have to do is outlast your opponent, and you score a"
163,00:09:33.75,00:09:33.75,point. First to three wins the Outback
164,00:09:36.58,00:09:36.58,Steakhouse reward. >> I love Outback Steakhouse.
165,00:09:40.08,00:09:40.08,"Before my husband left to Afghanistan, that whole week,"
166,00:09:43.71,00:09:43.71,twice we went there. >> PROBST: Really?
167,00:09:45.71,00:09:45.71,">> That's his spot. >> PROBST: So if you win, not"
168,00:09:48.04,00:09:48.04,"only are you going to get a full belly, you got some emotional"
169,00:09:50.25,00:09:50.25,attachment there. >> The fact that J.T. thinks
170,00:10:02.38,00:10:02.38,"this is an all-girl alliance gives me a perfect opportunity,"
171,00:10:05.54,00:10:05.54,"once we merge, to make him think I'm flipping."
172,00:10:08.17,00:10:08.17,"I done planted that little Russell seed in their mind, and"
173,00:10:10.50,00:10:10.50,"it's taken root, and they believe it."
174,00:10:22.25,00:10:22.25,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to move down to the third and"
175,00:10:25.46,00:10:25.46,final foothold. If you fall off during this
176,00:10:29.00,00:10:29.00,"time, you are out of the challenge."
177,00:10:31.67,00:10:31.67,We could lose somebody right here.
178,00:10:35.04,00:10:35.04,">> This peg is little. >> PROBST: Three, two, one."
179,00:10:41.17,00:10:41.17,Everybody's in position. This is where you're going to
180,00:10:43.67,00:10:43.67,stay for the rest of the challenge.
181,00:10:46.04,00:10:46.04,Your feet are now perched on a foothold that is about a
182,00:10:48.71,00:10:48.71,"quarter-inch wide. Now, it's going to get a little"
183,00:10:52.00,00:10:52.00,tougher. It'll start to hurt a little
184,00:10:54.46,00:10:54.46,bit. Everybody's got to dig deep.
185,00:11:01.21,00:11:01.21,"(Colby panting) Colby readjusting, trying to"
186,00:11:06.12,00:11:06.12,"find a sweet spot, somewhere that doesn't hurt."
187,00:11:09.12,00:11:09.12,"Once it starts to hurt, it's tough to get rid of the pain."
188,00:11:17.88,00:11:17.88,Colby drops out. Jerri scores the first point for
189,00:11:21.62,00:11:21.62,the Villains. Jerri can step down.
190,00:11:23.50,00:11:23.50,>> Hells yeah. >> PROBST: Don't lose your

192,00:11:27.29,00:11:27.29,>> PROBST: Jerri scores for the Villains.
193,00:11:29.17,00:11:29.17,Villains now have one point. You only need three.

195,00:11:37.21,00:11:37.21,Rupert fighting through the pain.
196,00:11:39.75,00:11:39.75,Rupert with a broken toe. Trying to hold on.
197,00:11:43.50,00:11:43.50,>> Hang on Sandra. You popped out some babies; this
198,00:11:46.33,00:11:46.33,ain't nothing. >> Two of them-- didn't even get
199,00:11:48.79,00:11:48.79,a aspirin. (laughs)
200,00:11:50.62,00:11:50.62,"Two natural births. >> Yeah, you got it."
201,00:11:53.58,00:11:53.58,">> Be strong, Rupe. >> PROBST: Beads of sweat"
202,00:11:56.42,00:11:56.42,"pouring off of Rupert's face. >> You got it, Rupe."
203,00:11:59.21,00:11:59.21,"You got it, buddy. Get in the zone."
204,00:12:02.25,00:12:02.25,">> PROBST: Rupert slobbering now, he's struggling so hard."
205,00:12:05.71,00:12:05.71,Rupert is out of the challenge. Sandra can step down.
206,00:12:08.79,00:12:08.79,>> One more minute. >> PROBST: Villains now have two
207,00:12:11.25,00:12:11.25,points. (laughs)
208,00:12:12.38,00:12:12.38,">> Sorry, guys. >> PROBST: The Villains need"
209,00:12:14.21,00:12:14.21,"just one more point. If J.T., Amanda or Candice fall"
210,00:12:21.12,00:12:21.12,"out of this challenge before their opponent, it's over for"
211,00:12:24.58,00:12:24.58,"the Heroes. Parvati readjusting again,"
212,00:12:29.25,00:12:29.25,trying to find some way to ease the pain.
213,00:12:33.62,00:12:33.62,"Amanda struggling a bit. >> Courtney, yep."
214,00:12:36.29,00:12:36.29,"She's shaking, Courtney, she's shaking."
215,00:12:38.17,00:12:38.17,>> PROBST: It could come down to this: Courtney versus Amanda.
216,00:12:41.96,00:12:41.96,They played this game together in China.
217,00:12:44.08,00:12:44.08,">> Courtney, hold on, Courtney. >> PROBST: Amanda needs to dig"
218,00:12:47.21,00:12:47.21,deep right now. Amanda drops out.
219,00:12:57.92,00:12:57.92,Villains win reward! (excited shouting)
220,00:13:00.04,00:13:00.04,">> Oh, my God, oh, my God! Are you crying?"
221,00:13:02.54,00:13:02.54,(laughs) Nice work.
222,00:13:07.25,00:13:07.25,"(laughs) >> PROBST: Heroes, after four"
223,00:13:12.12,00:13:12.12,"straight wins, got nothing for you."
224,00:13:14.12,00:13:14.12,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."

228,00:13:22.33,00:13:22.33,enjoy it. >> Thank you.
229,00:13:36.79,00:13:36.79,(ice rattling) >> Cheers.
230,00:13:39.79,00:13:39.79,>> To winning. >> Yay!
231,00:13:41.42,00:13:41.42,">> Cheers, Villains. >> Cheers."
232,00:13:43.29,00:13:43.29,">> Oh, my God, that's so good. >> Villains forever."
233,00:13:46.21,00:13:46.21,>> Whoo-hoo! >> This is delicious.
234,00:13:48.71,00:13:48.71,"(sucking air through straw) >> You're ready for another one,"
235,00:13:51.33,00:13:51.33,"Sandra. >> Sandra, is that their cue?"
236,00:13:54.25,00:13:54.25,>> You were drinking it? Sandra put one down.
237,00:13:57.04,00:13:57.04,">> Come here, homie. Give me that, homie."
238,00:13:59.08,00:13:59.08,>> Yeah! >> My husband is a soldier in
239,00:14:01.92,00:14:01.92,"the army, and I kind of felt bad I was without my husband because"
240,00:14:06.04,00:14:06.04,"I'm sure he wishes he was at Outback Steakhouse, too, because"
241,00:14:09.54,00:14:09.54,"we just love Outback. We always go to Outback, but,"
242,00:14:12.88,00:14:12.88,"you know, he's got to do his job and I got to do what I have to"
243,00:14:15.88,00:14:15.88,"do out here on Survivor. >> Oh, my God."
244,00:14:17.62,00:14:17.62,">> Thank you, Lord, for this meal."
245,00:14:19.33,00:14:19.33,">> Thank you so much, Lord. >> Thank you."
246,00:14:21.17,00:14:21.17,>> Wow. >> Yay.
247,00:14:23.17,00:14:23.17,>> I've been wanting a salad for ages.
248,00:14:25.08,00:14:25.08,">> Oh, my God, I'm using a napkin."
249,00:14:28.21,00:14:28.21,"(overlapping chatter) So after the drinks, we go and"
250,00:14:32.50,00:14:32.50,"our table is set and, you know, everyone is just diving into"
251,00:14:36.79,00:14:36.79,"their salads, and I picked up the napkin and, like, flicked it"
252,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,"open, and this little, tiny rolled up clue was inside my"
253,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,"napkin, and I was like, ""Oh, my gosh, I hope no one saw that."""
254,00:14:46.21,00:14:46.21,"I, like, stuffed it in my underwear as fast as I could."
255,00:14:50.17,00:14:50.17,">> Oh, my stomach just said thank you."
256,00:14:53.33,00:14:53.33,>> Wow. >> This is so good.
257,00:14:55.54,00:14:55.54,"You know, I knew it was a clue to a hidden immunity idol."
258,00:14:57.75,00:14:57.75,"I was like, ""Oh, my gosh, I am crazy lucky because I sat in the"
259,00:15:01.25,00:15:01.25,corner next to Danielle and I'm super lucky that it was in my
260,00:15:05.33,00:15:05.33,"napkin."" >> If and when the merge"
261,00:15:07.38,00:15:07.38,"happens, all those guys over there think that it's a girl"
262,00:15:10.67,00:15:10.67,alliance. It's just so funny that they
263,00:15:13.54,00:15:13.54,"assume that. >> Rupert, too, all the time,"
264,00:15:16.04,00:15:16.04,"he's like, ""That all-female alliance looks really strong."""
265,00:15:18.12,00:15:18.12,">> He's like, ""It's pretty obvious."
266,00:15:19.96,00:15:19.96,"It's so obvious. I'd stake me pirate life on it."""
267,00:15:24.17,00:15:24.17,>> Arr! (laughter)
268,00:15:26.46,00:15:26.46,>> Perfect. All the Heroes see is an all-
269,00:15:28.54,00:15:28.54,"women's alliance. First of all, there's no all-"
270,00:15:31.58,00:15:31.58,"girl alliance, and second of all, Russell's running the show."
271,00:15:35.96,00:15:35.96,"They have no idea what's going on over here, and it's awesome."
272,00:15:40.38,00:15:40.38,(laughs) >> Mmm.
273,00:15:45.08,00:15:45.08,>> There you go. Look at that.
274,00:15:47.33,00:15:47.33,Thank you. >> Yeah.
275,00:15:49.17,00:15:49.17,">> Thank you. Anything you wanted, the Outback"
276,00:15:52.08,00:15:52.08,way. >> Wow.
277,00:15:54.08,00:15:54.08,>> More shrimp and salad. >> We're happy now.
278,00:15:56.67,00:15:56.67,>> I'm gonna eat enough food for everybody.
279,00:15:59.00,00:15:59.00,>> This is good. >> It's really good.
280,00:16:00.67,00:16:00.67,">> Oh, my God. >> Mmm."
281,00:16:02.92,00:16:02.92,>> The best steak and potatoes I've ever had in my whole life.
282,00:16:06.12,00:16:06.12,>> I'm definitely finishing it. >> Yeah.
283,00:16:08.33,00:16:08.33,"Guys, I'm full already. >> You're full?"
284,00:16:10.54,00:16:10.54,">> I'm full. >> Oh, no."
285,00:16:12.04,00:16:12.04,">> I have to pee, though. I'm gonna get out."
286,00:16:14.12,00:16:14.12,Pardon moi. Danielle.
287,00:16:30.21,00:16:30.21,My napkin. >> How did nobody else see you
288,00:16:33.96,00:16:33.96,"get that? >> I don't know, I just, like,"
289,00:16:35.62,00:16:35.62,found it in my napkin and it fell into my lap and I just
290,00:16:37.88,00:16:37.88,"shoved it in my underwear. >> Oh, my God."
291,00:16:43.54,00:16:43.54,">> ""Another immunity idol is hidden at your camp."
292,00:16:47.08,00:16:47.08,"You want it in your possession, but it does you no good if you"
293,00:16:49.54,00:16:49.54,"don't know when to use it."" I shared the clue with Danielle"
294,00:16:52.58,00:16:52.58,"just so Danielle knows, like, I'm on her side."
295,00:16:55.25,00:16:55.25,I want Danielle to feel tighter with me than she does with
296,00:16:57.50,00:16:57.50,anyone else. >> You don't have a pocket or
297,00:16:59.25,00:16:59.25,"anything? >> No, but I can put it in my"
298,00:17:01.62,00:17:01.62,boobs. >> It was kind of a part of my
299,00:17:04.17,00:17:04.17,"plan to make Danielle feel really connected to me, so that"
300,00:17:07.96,00:17:07.96,"at the end of the game, she feels more loyal to me so that"
301,00:17:10.92,00:17:10.92,"she'll protect me over Russell. >> All right, perfect."
302,00:17:13.21,00:17:13.21,">> All right, potty break. >> I'm gonna go to the bathroom."
303,00:17:15.38,00:17:15.38,">> We'll fill Russell in on a need-to-know basis, and right"
304,00:17:18.96,00:17:18.96,"now Russell doesn't need to know, so he's not going to know."
305,00:17:25.71,00:17:25.71,>> You know what? I don't give a damn about steak.
306,00:17:30.38,00:17:30.38,I've eaten at least a thousand steaks in my time.
307,00:17:35.08,00:17:35.08,(chuckles) So I'm not gonna worry about a
308,00:17:37.58,00:17:37.58,"damn steak when we got a game to play, you know?"
309,00:17:40.79,00:17:40.79,"To hear that there were steaks up for grabs was tough because,"
310,00:17:44.42,00:17:44.42,"you know, I live off steaks. I raise cattle."
311,00:17:46.29,00:17:46.29,"I cut my own steaks up, you know."
312,00:17:48.38,00:17:48.38,We eat black angus beef right off the farm.
313,00:17:51.29,00:17:51.29,But we didn't come out here to win steaks.
314,00:17:53.12,00:17:53.12,We came out here to win the big prize.
315,00:17:55.42,00:17:55.42,If we win this next immunity challenge...
316,00:18:01.00,00:18:01.00,"I got a plan. >> Uh-oh, J.T.'s got a plan."
317,00:18:05.21,00:18:05.21,>> Let's hear it. >> The next immunity challenge
318,00:18:07.42,00:18:07.42,guarantees us the finals. >> Let's hear the plan.
319,00:18:11.58,00:18:11.58,>> But we're relying on the merge.
320,00:18:13.88,00:18:13.88,I bet my life in this game on it that we're going to merge.
321,00:18:17.12,00:18:17.12,"Russell knows he's going next. So, granted I get a chance to"
322,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,"talk to Russell at the next immunity challenge and we win, I"
323,00:18:30.54,00:18:30.54,"give him the hidden immunity idol, he votes out Parvati..."
324,00:18:35.17,00:18:35.17,"bam, done. >> How are you gonna give it to"
325,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17,"him, though? >> Hand it to him."
326,00:18:40.58,00:18:40.58,>> Wrapped up with a sheet of paper with instructions on what
327,00:18:43.12,00:18:43.12,to do with it. Parvati's gone.
328,00:18:47.00,00:18:47.00,>> Then pick the girls off. >> Pick 'em off like sitting
329,00:18:49.25,00:18:49.25,"ducks, then vote Russell's ass out sixth."
330,00:18:52.96,00:18:52.96,>> I think it's really crazy to give Russell the idol.
331,00:18:56.25,00:18:56.25,You don't know what's going on over there.
332,00:18:58.29,00:18:58.29,He could be in with the girls for all we know.
333,00:19:00.50,00:19:00.50,"Like, we don't know. What do you think about this"
334,00:19:03.79,00:19:03.79,"idea? I mean, it could give us the"
335,00:19:08.17,00:19:08.17,numbers and it gets the idol away from him.
336,00:19:12.67,00:19:12.67,"He just gives it up. >> ""Cross over the bridge to the"
337,00:19:45.08,00:19:45.08,"dancing trees."" Dancing trees?"
338,00:19:48.38,00:19:48.38,>> Let's go look and see if any look like they're dancing.
339,00:19:52.04,00:19:52.04,Danielle and I woke up this morning and we're like quiet
340,00:19:54.58,00:19:54.58,little mice running around because there's an immunity
341,00:19:57.08,00:19:57.08,idol hidden at our camp and we didn't want Russell to see us.
342,00:20:01.04,00:20:01.04,">> Dancing... tree. >> It's those right there, right"
343,00:20:04.88,00:20:04.88,there. You think?
344,00:20:08.12,00:20:08.12,>> Yeah. Yeah.
345,00:20:11.08,00:20:11.08,>> They look like they're dancing.
346,00:20:12.71,00:20:12.71,"All right, so I guess look right here."
347,00:20:14.79,00:20:14.79,>> Yeah. It could be behind this.
348,00:20:25.33,00:20:25.33,"It could be over here, too. >> (laughing): Oh, my God."
349,00:20:41.17,00:20:41.17,">> What? >> Oh, my God, we just found"
350,00:20:43.67,00:20:43.67,"that in, like, four seconds. Here, hold this so I can cover"
351,00:20:46.71,00:20:46.71,it up. >> Nice.
352,00:20:50.50,00:20:50.50,>> We found the idol. I am the happiest girl in the
353,00:20:54.50,00:20:54.50,world that I found that idol because it gives me control of
354,00:20:57.83,00:20:57.83,the game right now. This is a big deal.
355,00:21:02.38,00:21:02.38,"Oh, my God, I can't believe we have that."
356,00:21:04.92,00:21:04.92,And I'm not going to tell Russell about the idol right
357,00:21:06.71,00:21:06.71,now. I want Russell to be out of the
358,00:21:09.00,00:21:09.00,loop for a little bit. I don't see anything wrong with
359,00:21:11.08,00:21:11.08,making him wait. I really don't.
360,00:21:12.25,00:21:12.25,It doesn't mean I don't trust him.
361,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,It's just... I kind of want to see him squirm
362,00:21:16.38,00:21:16.38,a little bit. It's fun.
363,00:21:20.42,00:21:20.42,(both laugh) It's not all Russell running the
364,00:21:23.75,00:21:23.75,show around here. He is not the king of Survivor.
365,00:21:27.00,00:21:27.00,I'm the queen. (laughs)
366,00:21:29.58,00:21:29.58,"And usually the king does what the queen says anyway, so I'm"
367,00:21:33.71,00:21:33.71,cool. >> You're writing your letter to
368,00:21:58.54,00:21:58.54,"Russell, buddy? >> Yep."
369,00:22:04.79,00:22:04.79,"""Russell, this is a huge turning point in this game."
370,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,This is not fake. I wouldn't waste your time
371,00:22:10.17,00:22:10.17,or mine. Just by competing against you
372,00:22:12.75,00:22:12.75,"and the few handshakes we've had, I feel like I can"
373,00:22:14.79,00:22:14.79,trust you. Play the idol tonight and
374,00:22:16.96,00:22:16.96,save yourself. All the girls should be writing
375,00:22:19.21,00:22:19.21,"your name down, so act like you know you're going home."
376,00:22:21.79,00:22:21.79,I think you should write Parvati's name down to send
377,00:22:24.46,00:22:24.46,her home. We will most likely merge at
378,00:22:27.08,00:22:27.08,"ten people, and then you will be completely safe with us."

406,00:24:11.12,00:24:11.12,guaranteed a one-in-ten shot at winning a million bucks.

439,00:25:54.38,00:25:54.38,the Villains. She's definitely made up some of
440,00:25:57.08,00:25:57.08,"the time that Jerri lost. >> Come on, Danielle!"

570,00:32:57.62,00:32:57.62,"But I don't like Courtney, 'cause I think she'll flip."
571,00:33:01.17,00:33:01.17,>> So are they gonna vote for me or Sandra?
572,00:33:03.38,00:33:03.38,">> I don't know. I don't know what to do, because"
573,00:33:05.92,00:33:05.92,I wanted to keep you forever. You know?
574,00:33:08.00,00:33:08.00,">> I know. I mean, the only thing I can say"
575,00:33:10.50,00:33:10.50,"to you is that if we have five, and if I'm there, Amanda is more"
576,00:33:13.46,00:33:13.46,likely to come with us. >> Yeah.
577,00:33:15.46,00:33:15.46,>> Because she trusts me. Do you know what I mean?
578,00:33:17.46,00:33:17.46,>> Mm-hmm. >> That's my only perk.
579,00:33:19.46,00:33:19.46,"'Cause I would stay with you. Well, whatever."
580,00:33:21.46,00:33:21.46,That's my argument for me. I'm not going to throw Sandra
581,00:33:23.46,00:33:23.46,"under the bus. I wouldn't vote for her, either."
582,00:33:25.46,00:33:25.46,"So I'm just going to vote for Jerri, I guess, and whatever"
583,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,"happens, happens. >> Look, you would definitely"
584,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,stay with me? >> Yeah.
585,00:33:34.04,00:33:34.04,">> Things are going to go crazy as soon as we merge, because"
586,00:33:37.54,00:33:37.54,it's five-five. As long as I know you'll stick
587,00:33:40.12,00:33:40.12,"with me, then I'll do what I can do to keep you."
588,00:33:43.00,00:33:43.00,>> I'm... I'm... >> But you have to be with me.
589,00:33:45.25,00:33:45.25,(laughter) Courtney and I have become
590,00:33:47.25,00:33:47.25,"really close, and, uh, I don't know."
591,00:33:49.25,00:33:49.25,"I want to keep Courtney here, because I feel like, once"
592,00:33:51.46,00:33:51.46,"there's a merge, she would stay more loyal to me than to"
593,00:33:54.04,00:33:54.04,Russell. I want to keep myself kind of
594,00:34:00.75,00:34:00.75,"lower key on this one, because if I try to save her too much,"
595,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,"people are going to think, ""Oh, she has something on the side"
596,00:34:08.33,00:34:08.33,"with Courtney."" (Parvati laughs)"
597,00:34:11.46,00:34:11.46,>> They gave him their idol. >> J.T. gave me their idol to
598,00:34:15.25,00:34:15.25,save me tonight. >> Shut up!
599,00:34:17.25,00:34:17.25,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God!"
600,00:34:19.50,00:34:19.50,>> Are you dying? Are you dying?
601,00:34:21.50,00:34:21.50,>> Shut up. >> Save yourself.
602,00:34:23.50,00:34:23.50,>> He did not do that. >> They just think this girl
603,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,thing is way too strong. >> They are so set on the girl
604,00:34:28.21,00:34:28.21,"thing, which is why I want to talk to you about Courtney,"
605,00:34:30.96,00:34:30.96,because I think we need to keep Courtney tonight.
606,00:34:35.08,00:34:35.08,">> Yeah. >> I just think, Courtney would"
607,00:34:37.08,00:34:37.08,be more likely to stick with us than Sandra.
608,00:34:39.08,00:34:39.08,Do you trust that you have Sandra's loyalty?
609,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,>> I don't trust Courtney at all.
610,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,"I-I think she'll flip, and then all of a sudden..."
611,00:34:45.08,00:34:45.08,>> I-I think Sandra will flip way before Courtney.
612,00:34:46.92,00:34:46.92,">> All of a sudden, they have, uh..."
613,00:34:48.71,00:34:48.71,">> And she's more strategic. >> I think they'll both flip, so"
614,00:34:50.62,00:34:50.62,it just comes down to who's more threatening...
615,00:34:52.42,00:34:52.42,">> All of a sudden, you got Amanda talking to you."
616,00:34:54.25,00:34:54.25,>> ...as far as who can talk better-- Sandra or Courtney?
617,00:34:55.83,00:34:55.83,">> Sandra, and who makes up lies for no reason?"
618,00:34:57.62,00:34:57.62,>> I just think Courtney is way more likely to go flip-flop.
619,00:35:00.00,00:35:00.00,">> But then you have to look at, like, if she gets to the end,"
620,00:35:02.08,00:35:02.08,Sandra would be harder to beat than Courtney.
621,00:35:04.08,00:35:04.08,>> Courtney would be easier to stick to...
622,00:35:06.08,00:35:06.08,>> To keep track of. >> To keep track of.
623,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,">> For me. >> I mean, it really doesn't"
624,00:35:14.25,00:35:14.25,matter one way or the other with me.
625,00:35:16.50,00:35:16.50,>> I feel like I can keep Courtney in check more than I
626,00:35:18.75,00:35:18.75,can keep Sandra. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
627,00:35:39.33,00:35:39.33,"the first member of our jury... Coach, voted out at the last"
628,00:35:43.92,00:35:43.92,"Tribal Council. Sandra, at the last Tribal"
629,00:35:52.12,00:35:52.12,"Council, trust was once again the big theme."
630,00:35:56.12,00:35:56.12,Is that going to be the case again tonight?
631,00:35:58.92,00:35:58.92,">> To me, it's like when I'm sitting in the living room in"
632,00:36:01.50,00:36:01.50,"my house, whoever Jeff asks the trust question to-- that's the"
633,00:36:04.04,00:36:04.04,last person that should be answering that question.
634,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,"I'm in trouble. I know I am, because Tyson was"
635,00:36:08.62,00:36:08.62,in my alliance. He's gone.
636,00:36:10.62,00:36:10.62,Boston Rob was in my alliance. He's gone.
637,00:36:12.62,00:36:12.62,"And today, it's between me and Courtney."
638,00:36:14.62,00:36:14.62,"One of us two is going. >> PROBST: Is that right,"
639,00:36:16.62,00:36:16.62,"Courtney? Is that what you think, as well?"
640,00:36:18.62,00:36:18.62,It's you or Sandra? >> Yes.
641,00:36:20.92,00:36:20.92,">> PROBST: Russell, is there any correlation to the fact that"
642,00:36:23.46,00:36:23.46,"Sandra and Courtney are also the people who sit out, by far, the"
643,00:36:27.04,00:36:27.04,"most often in challenges? >> No, not to me."
644,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33,It's always that same question-- who can I trust the most?
645,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,">> PROBST: Danielle, what is it about Sandra and her"
646,00:36:37.50,00:36:37.50,trustworthiness or lack thereof that has her name coming up
647,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,tonight? >> That she's not in my
648,00:36:43.38,00:36:43.38,"alliance, and I've seen how she's playing the game, and"
649,00:36:47.42,00:36:47.42,she's able to manipulate people. >> PROBST: Give me an example.
650,00:36:51.33,00:36:51.33,">> Yeah, me, too. Give me an example."
651,00:36:54.00,00:36:54.00,">> Okay, um, I've seen you put into people's minds different"
652,00:36:57.00,00:36:57.00,things that maybe weren't true just to stir the pot up.
653,00:37:01.04,00:37:01.04,">> PROBST: But Danielle, the question was trustworthiness,"
654,00:37:03.67,00:37:03.67,"not big mouth. >> Well, that's kind of..."
655,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,She's just not been on my side. >> PROBST: That's just not doing
656,00:37:11.08,00:37:11.08,what you want her to do. >> Me and Boston Rob were
657,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,"together from the beginning, but then it comes down to me,"
658,00:37:16.62,00:37:16.62,"because now I'm the one left. >> No, no, no."
659,00:37:18.62,00:37:18.62,Rob and you decided to not talk to me and pull in Courtney and
660,00:37:22.25,00:37:22.25,"Tyson, and I had nowhere to go. So, what was I supposed to do?"
661,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,>> That didn't have nothing to do with Sandra.
662,00:37:27.12,00:37:27.12,">> Yeah, but you were a part of it, and you didn't make me"
663,00:37:29.12,00:37:29.12,"feel like... >> Make you feel how, if you're"
664,00:37:31.12,00:37:31.12,running off with Parvati and Russell?
665,00:37:33.12,00:37:33.12,"Make you feel how? >> Well, you were running off..."
666,00:37:34.92,00:37:34.92,>> Why should I come to you and say hello when you don't come
667,00:37:36.50,00:37:36.50,"and say hello to me? >> You were Rob's, like,"
668,00:37:38.50,00:37:38.50,"sidekick. Whatever Rob said to do, you"
669,00:37:40.29,00:37:40.29,"went and did, and he said to watch..."
670,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,>> And that's exactly what you do with Parvati.
671,00:37:44.12,00:37:44.12,"She's the boss, and you do whatever she..."
672,00:37:45.92,00:37:45.92,">> But I trust them. I don't... >> Okay, so there's no"
673,00:37:47.50,00:37:47.50,difference. >> She doesn't tell me to do
674,00:37:49.29,00:37:49.29,anything. I'm my own person.
675,00:37:51.21,00:37:51.21,>> And I'm my own person. Rob doesn't tell me what to do.
676,00:37:52.92,00:37:52.92,">> Well, it sure didn't look like it."
677,00:37:55.12,00:37:55.12,">> PROBST: So, Parvati, are you the boss?"
678,00:37:58.25,00:37:58.25,">> Of course. If you ask the Heroes, I'm the"
679,00:38:00.58,00:38:00.58,boss. I'm running a crazy women's
680,00:38:03.54,00:38:03.54,"alliance over here. >> PROBST: Parvati, what about"
681,00:38:07.62,00:38:07.62,"Courtney is not trustworthy? >> For me, it's not about"
682,00:38:10.21,00:38:10.21,trustworthiness. It's about alliances.
683,00:38:12.92,00:38:12.92,"I mean, in the beginning of this game, there was a strong"
684,00:38:15.42,00:38:15.42,division-- Boston Rob's girls versus Russell's girls-- and
685,00:38:18.46,00:38:18.46,Rob's gone. >> I'll tell you what trust will
686,00:38:21.08,00:38:21.08,do. We had a group of ten.
687,00:38:23.79,00:38:23.79,"We had three people that really trust each other-- me, Parvati"
688,00:38:27.42,00:38:27.42,and Danielle-- and we're still sitting here.
689,00:38:29.46,00:38:29.46,That's what trust can do for you.
690,00:38:31.75,00:38:31.75,"If you really believe it, and if it's really true, you can make"
691,00:38:34.54,00:38:34.54,it all the way to the end in this game.
692,00:38:37.29,00:38:37.29,">> PROBST: Courtney, that ring true to you?"
693,00:38:39.42,00:38:39.42,">> Yeah, there's a tight alliance that formed, and you"
694,00:38:41.83,00:38:41.83,"can't hate on the three of them. But you know, I stuck with Rob"
695,00:38:45.17,00:38:45.17,"when I knew he was going to go, and so that was, like, the"
696,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,"beginning of the end for me and Sandra's side, which Jerri was a"
697,00:38:51.21,00:38:51.21,"part of and Coach was a part of, too, in the beginning and then"
698,00:38:53.75,00:38:53.75,"it all went... >> No, I never asked to be a"
699,00:38:55.75,00:38:55.75,"part of that group, not once, so..."
700,00:38:57.75,00:38:57.75,>> You didn't vote for Parvati? >> I was never in anybody's
701,00:39:01.21,00:39:01.21,"alliance, is my point... >> All right, well you voted"
702,00:39:03.04,00:39:03.04,"against the alliance you're a part of now, but you flipped"
703,00:39:05.79,00:39:05.79,"just in time to save your butt, so awesome for you."
704,00:39:08.54,00:39:08.54,"I didn't flip quick enough, I guess, and so, that's why me and"
705,00:39:12.12,00:39:12.12,"Sandra are in trouble. >> PROBST: Well, the stakes are"
706,00:39:16.46,00:39:16.46,"clearly high. Now, it's time to make your"
707,00:39:18.75,00:39:18.75,decision. It is time to vote.
708,00:39:21.17,00:39:21.17,"Sandra, you're up. I'll go tally the votes."
709,00:40:03.92,00:40:03.92,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
710,00:40:06.88,00:40:06.88,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
711,00:40:09.25,00:40:09.25,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
712,00:40:13.29,00:40:13.29,First vote... Jerri.
713,00:40:18.79,00:40:18.79,"Courtney. One vote-- Jerri, one vote--"
714,00:40:21.46,00:40:21.46,Courtney. Courtney.
715,00:40:29.46,00:40:29.46,"Courtney. That's three votes-- Courtney,"
716,00:40:32.04,00:40:32.04,one vote-- Jerri. Tenth person voted out and the
717,00:40:37.38,00:40:37.38,second member of our jury-- Courtney.
718,00:40:39.42,00:40:39.42,That's four. That's enough. You need to bring me your
719,00:40:41.67,00:40:41.67,"torch. Courtney, the tribe has spoken."
720,00:40:54.67,00:40:54.67,">> Good luck, bitches. See you later."
721,00:40:56.67,00:40:56.67,>> Bye. >> PROBST: Time for you to go.
722,00:40:58.96,00:40:58.96,">> Bye, Courtney. >> Bye."
723,00:41:06.92,00:41:06.92,">> PROBST: Well, time will tell if you made the right vote"
724,00:41:09.25,00:41:09.25,"tonight, but here's one thing for sure-- we are now even."
725,00:41:12.12,00:41:12.12,"Five Villains, five Heroes. One other note-- congratulations"
726,00:41:16.50,00:41:16.50,"to Parvati. Tomorrow, you will join Amanda"
727,00:41:18.96,00:41:18.96,as the only people to have played 100 days in the game of
728,00:41:22.00,00:41:22.00,"Survivor. >> Thank you, Jeff."
729,00:41:24.50,00:41:24.50,">> PROBST: Grab your torches, head back to camp."
730,00:41:26.50,00:41:26.50,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
731,00:41:40.00,00:41:40.00,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
732,00:41:46.33,00:41:46.33,Survivor. >> This ought to be interesting.
733,00:41:48.33,00:41:48.33,>> PROBST: Five Heroes and Five Villains...
734,00:41:51.96,00:41:51.96,>> PROBST: ...will collide. This is where I stand.
735,00:41:57.08,00:41:57.08,>> They think they have the game right now.
736,00:41:59.21,00:41:59.21,">> Whatever Russell says, he's lying if he says that the women"
737,00:42:01.08,00:42:01.08,are running the show. >> This is where the game gets
738,00:42:03.08,00:42:03.08,crazy. >> I have to say that I am very
739,00:42:11.46,00:42:11.46,proud of myself. This is pretty good for the
740,00:42:13.83,00:42:13.83,little skinny chick to get all the way to the jury.
741,00:42:16.17,00:42:16.17,Good for me. It's actually one of my Survivor
742,00:42:18.21,00:42:18.21,dreams to be on the jury and get all pretty and make all the
743,00:42:21.04,00:42:21.04,bitches jealous as they sit there in their dirty rags.
744,00:42:23.21,00:42:23.21,"I've been really lucky in both my Survivor experiences, and"
745,00:42:25.50,00:42:25.50,"there's nobody I intensely hate. So, good luck everybody."
