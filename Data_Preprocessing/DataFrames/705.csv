75,00:04:42.77,00:04:42.77,going to raise another twoor three feet.
76,00:04:45.57,00:04:45.57,And they're using logs to tryand stop the tide from taking
77,00:04:49.77,00:04:49.77,their shelter away.It's not going to work.
78,00:04:54.43,00:04:54.43,You need to tear your shelterdown and rebuild your shelter

80,00:04:57.37,00:04:57.37,"Right now, we decided to goahead and move our shelter,"
81,00:05:00.40,00:05:00.40,"'cause, according to Rupert,by the time the full moon comes,"

83,00:05:06.30,00:05:06.30,the waves and stuff.And just kind of clear some
84,00:05:09.33,00:05:09.33,"of this stuff out.So, we're going to move our"

86,00:05:15.63,00:05:15.63,">> What... how is this going tobe set up, now?"
87,00:05:19.50,00:05:19.50,This is absurd.We haven't actually got hit by
88,00:05:23.13,00:05:23.13,"the water yet, so, my thought's,""Wait till it becomes a problem,"
89,00:05:27.07,00:05:27.07,"then deal with it.""But they think it's a state of"
90,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"emergency.>> So, what do you think?"
91,00:05:34.87,00:05:34.87,">> Looks good.O.T. said, ""Why don't we just"

95,00:05:47.07,00:05:47.07,moved.>> Right this second?
96,00:05:49.63,00:05:49.63,>> There are reasons not to doit over there?
97,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,">> But if you guys want itover there, and it's a unanimous"
98,00:05:53.73,00:05:53.73,"vote... well, not a unanimousvote, but..."
99,00:05:56.27,00:05:56.27,>> I just don't agree withmoving it close to the jungle.

104,00:06:08.90,00:06:08.90,"But that way, we're going tohave to dig up the whole fire"
105,00:06:10.90,00:06:10.90,pit and move all the logs.>> Oh.
106,00:06:14.70,00:06:14.70,>> These guys work very hardat not working.
107,00:06:18.73,00:06:18.73,They fight and argue and bickerand bitch amongst each other
108,00:06:21.87,00:06:21.87,so much that I know why it takesthem hours to do anything.
109,00:06:25.67,00:06:25.67,I know why they don't really dogreat in the challenges.
110,00:06:28.23,00:06:28.23,I know why they're not really agreat team.
111,00:06:30.27,00:06:30.27,">> Make a vote, I guess.Who's for here?"
112,00:06:38.07,00:06:38.07,">> Osten, he had an idea, andeverybody kind of shot it down."

114,00:06:44.27,00:06:44.27,"towards the jungle, a little bithigher ground."
115,00:06:47.17,00:06:47.17,>> Let's go.>> It's kind of like remodeling
116,00:06:56.23,00:06:56.23,a house with four bad walls.>> I want a can of something.
117,00:07:15.57,00:07:15.57,">> Well, don't we have an extracan of Spam?"
118,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17,>> Yeah.>> We do?
119,00:07:18.50,00:07:18.50,(mutters)Are we going to wait for Rupert

124,00:07:30.07,00:07:30.07,them a little bit.My concern with Rupert is that
125,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,I'm afraid he's giving awaytoo much information about us
126,00:07:35.87,00:07:35.87,"and not realizing it.>> Well, you know they're"
127,00:07:38.33,00:07:38.33,telling that the Morgans arejust like...

134,00:07:58.70,00:07:58.70,They don't know if Rupert wentto the other side.

140,00:08:24.33,00:08:24.33,I think they're waiting for you.>> I know they are.

180,00:11:17.33,00:11:17.33,clean somehow.So we figured we would
181,00:11:18.70,00:11:18.70,potentially get something thatwould dry us off and then
182,00:11:21.57,00:11:21.57,something that would keep usclean.

570,00:32:50.70,00:32:50.70,I just couldn't get thesardine down.
571,00:32:52.67,00:32:52.67,"Why did they have to pick me?>> I don't know, man."
572,00:32:55.70,00:32:55.70,"I should have played it up more.>> And so, I feel when we go"
573,00:32:59.03,00:32:59.03,"to Tribal Council tonight that,why shouldn't I be the one going"
574,00:33:01.33,00:33:01.33,home if this is all my fault?Nobody wants to be the cause of
575,00:33:05.47,00:33:05.47,the tribe going to TribalCouncil.
576,00:33:08.23,00:33:08.23,">> Dude, it doesn't matter.It's okay."
577,00:33:09.87,00:33:09.87,"I mean, you did your best.That's all you can do, right?"
578,00:33:12.63,00:33:12.63,>> All of that is easy to saywhen you're not on the chopping
579,00:33:14.97,00:33:14.97,block.Lord have mercy.
580,00:33:18.63,00:33:18.63,>> I'm pissed the ... off.That was the easiest...

582,00:33:23.80,00:33:23.80,entire ... game.I feel like the last immunity
583,00:33:27.07,00:33:27.07,"challenge was mind over matter.Obviously, a sardine is bigger"
584,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"than Sandra's mind.Secondly, I'm extremely pissed"
585,00:33:35.90,00:33:35.90,off at Michelle.Michelle was planning on
586,00:33:39.30,00:33:39.30,pretending as though she wouldbe the worst in the bunch when
587,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,in reality she was technicallythe best.
588,00:33:45.97,00:33:45.97,>> I almost fell off my chairwhen she chugged that thing.
589,00:33:48.40,00:33:48.40,The plan was she was supposed togag that down.
590,00:33:51.37,00:33:51.37,">> But her freakin' ego wouldn'tlet her do it, and, uh... that's"
591,00:33:55.57,00:33:55.57,what I feel about her ego rightnow.
592,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,>> You and I know about thesephysical challenges.
593,00:34:03.43,00:34:03.43,You know what I mean?>> Yep.
594,00:34:05.90,00:34:05.90,>> Michelle can run.>> I know.
595,00:34:08.20,00:34:08.20,But this isn't the time rightnow to talk about it.
596,00:34:10.03,00:34:10.03,">> I know, but you know what I'msaying."
597,00:34:11.63,00:34:11.63,>> I know.>> I'm thinking about winning.

599,00:34:17.77,00:34:17.77,and he's already trying to getsomebody out.
600,00:34:19.80,00:34:19.80,"He better watch out, or it'llbe him."
601,00:34:24.53,00:34:24.53,>> What are you thinking about?(grunts)
602,00:34:27.93,00:34:27.93,I know majority goes me.I'm-I'm just having big
603,00:34:31.57,00:34:31.57,"problems.It just, it bothers me that..."
604,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80,"we have maybe one more challengebefore the merge, and Shawn,"
605,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,"who is, you know, just...I can't trust him further than"
606,00:34:47.23,00:34:47.23,"I could throw him.>> You know, they say that he"
607,00:34:51.40,00:34:51.40,"did something when I'm gone.But when I'm here, he does"
608,00:34:52.97,00:34:52.97,"nothing, and he eats more thananybody."
609,00:34:54.77,00:34:54.77,He does nothing.(gagging)
610,00:35:07.90,00:35:07.90,What could we say to convincepeople to vote for Shawn and
611,00:35:11.83,00:35:11.83,convince them that we don't needthe damn strength of Shawn
612,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,'cause he's not that stronganyway?
613,00:35:16.63,00:35:16.63,"(coughing)>> There's, like, one more"
614,00:35:22.20,00:35:22.20,challenge.>> Michelle feels like she is
615,00:35:28.97,00:35:28.97,going.She is trying to make a plea
616,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,"that she works as hard, if notharder, than Shawn, and she"
617,00:35:38.77,00:35:38.77,eats lots less.She never takes more than her
618,00:35:41.20,00:35:41.20,share.>> My point is that once the
619,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90,"merge comes, which will happenreally soon..."
620,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,>> I know.>> ...it just doesn't seem to
621,00:35:48.07,00:35:48.07,make sense to me that peoplewould want him around at the
622,00:35:52.10,00:35:52.10,merge rather than myself.>> She swayed me enough that I
623,00:35:56.40,00:35:56.40,will mention it to others.Do we want to take Shawn out of
624,00:35:58.97,00:35:58.97,this game?It's day 15-- he was our first
625,00:36:01.37,00:36:01.37,pick on day two.>> PROBST: What a difference a

629,00:36:34.80,00:36:34.80,in the tiebreaker.Gave it a great effort.
630,00:36:39.57,00:36:39.57,It wasn't enough.Are you worried that it might

632,00:36:45.83,00:36:45.83,Then I'll deal with it.I'm just sorry.
633,00:36:49.63,00:36:49.63,That's all I can say.>> PROBST: Is this tribe
634,00:36:52.70,00:36:52.70,starting to splinter a littlebit?
635,00:36:54.30,00:36:54.30,"Is that a fair assessment,losing this many challenges"
636,00:36:56.30,00:36:56.30,in a row?>> No.
637,00:36:58.07,00:36:58.07,We-we didn't expect to lose thischallenge here.
638,00:37:00.63,00:37:00.63,And I've apologized to the tribea couple of times today because
639,00:37:03.77,00:37:03.77,of the fact that I didn't pullthrough it.
640,00:37:05.97,00:37:05.97,"We didn't even plan to lose thischallenge but, you know, things"

644,00:37:15.30,00:37:15.30,"From where I'm looking at it,Jon, you didn't know if you had"
645,00:37:18.00,00:37:18.00,a rudder or a paddle or what todo with it.
646,00:37:20.57,00:37:20.57,"Was that discussed among thetribe, or was that just an"

648,00:37:26.27,00:37:26.27,was the first challenge of allthe challenges that we actually
649,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,"lost, as far as, uh, we sawit."

654,00:37:45.47,00:37:45.47,going on.>> PROBST: So now that you've
655,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,"lost three in a row, you want tocome clean and say, ""Well, we"
656,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"actually didn't lose the firstone, we threw it."""
657,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,">> Yeah, absolutely.>> PROBST: My point is, throwing"
658,00:37:54.77,00:37:54.77,a challenge in a game like thisis really cocky.

665,00:38:17.50,00:38:17.50,winning that one challenge andthen continuing for two after
666,00:38:19.90,00:38:19.90,that is enough to keep onwinning.
667,00:38:23.37,00:38:23.37,"Um, I don't expect that Drakewill have to lose to Morgan"
668,00:38:25.63,00:38:25.63,again.>> When they decided to throw
