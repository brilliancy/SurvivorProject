3,00:00:03.90,00:00:03.90,had its drawbacks. >> I'm saying that a little
4,00:00:06.50,00:00:06.50,more help would be appreciated. >> It's starting to get annoying
5,00:00:08.90,00:00:08.90,because we really want somebody to leave.
6,00:00:11.87,00:00:11.87,">> PROBST: At Morgan, the tide was up and spirits were down."
7,00:00:14.43,00:00:14.43,>> I think it's us against everything else out here.
8,00:00:16.80,00:00:16.80,">> PROBST: At the reward challenge, Osten almost drowned."
9,00:00:19.57,00:00:19.57,>> I need help! >> PROBST: While Andrew and Ryno
10,00:00:21.10,00:00:21.10,"saved him, Drake won their sixth straight victory."
11,00:00:22.83,00:00:22.83,"Drake wins reward! In the dark of night, Burton"
12,00:00:27.93,00:00:27.93,"approached Rupert with a plan. >> At some point, we should"
13,00:00:30.80,00:00:30.80,"lose. We can do it, but we have to get"
14,00:00:32.93,00:00:32.93,rid of Christa. >> He's a traitor.
15,00:00:34.43,00:00:34.43,"If this was a pirate culture, he'd already be dead."
16,00:00:37.77,00:00:37.77,">> PROBST: Reluctant to go along with the plan, Rupert sat out"
17,00:00:39.83,00:00:39.83,while his tribe threw the immunity challenge.
18,00:00:41.70,00:00:41.70,Morgan wins immunity! But a surprise twist allowed
19,00:00:46.23,00:00:46.23,Morgan to kidnap one Drake member until the next challenge.
20,00:00:50.23,00:00:50.23,"Who's it going to be, Savage? >> Rupert."
21,00:00:52.30,00:00:52.30,>> PROBST: Rupert became a temporary member of the Morgan
22,00:00:54.40,00:00:54.40,Tribe. >> It's all good.
23,00:00:56.33,00:00:56.33,">> PROBST: Back at Drake, Jon was playing both sides of"
24,00:00:58.27,00:00:58.27,the fence. >> I got a five-way alliance
25,00:00:59.73,00:00:59.73,"with Trish, Rupert, Christa and Sandra."
26,00:01:03.23,00:01:03.23,"And I have a four-way alliance with Shawn, Burton and Michelle."
27,00:01:07.73,00:01:07.73,"I'm a freakin' puppet master. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
28,00:01:09.63,00:01:09.63,"Burton's plan to throw the immunity challenge backfired,"
29,00:01:11.50,00:01:11.50,"when the majority of his tribe, including his ally Shawn, voted"
30,00:01:14.50,00:01:14.50,him out. 12 are left.
31,00:01:20.47,00:01:20.47,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
32,00:02:00.93,00:02:00.93,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Well, well, well."
33,00:02:35.50,00:02:35.50,I know what Shawn wrote on his card.
34,00:02:38.10,00:02:38.10,">> My card said ""Burton."" (Jon chuckles)"
35,00:02:40.67,00:02:40.67,">> Shawn's card did say ""Burton."""
36,00:02:42.03,00:02:42.03,"Last night, en route to Tribal Council, I looked over"
37,00:02:45.17,00:02:45.17,"at Shawn and I said, ""I got a little information for you."
38,00:02:47.87,00:02:47.87,Burton's gone. Vote however you want.
39,00:02:51.10,00:02:51.10,"I suggest you write 'Burton.'"" (laughs)"
40,00:02:55.40,00:02:55.40,">> I had a core alliance which consisted of myself, Burton,"
41,00:02:57.87,00:02:57.87,"Michelle and, I thought, Jon. I've always been a little weary"
42,00:03:04.20,00:03:04.20,"of Burton, and, um, to be honest with you, I've been looking"
43,00:03:06.60,00:03:06.60,"for a way to get rid of him. Hey, listen, Burton annoyed me"
44,00:03:08.83,00:03:08.83,more than... more than you think.
45,00:03:10.63,00:03:10.63,"(Jon laughs) >> Oh, I find that hard to"
46,00:03:12.73,00:03:12.73,believe. >> Do you really?
47,00:03:14.10,00:03:14.10,">> Yeah. >> Well, then, you're wrong,"
48,00:03:15.90,00:03:15.90,because he did. >> The joke to me was Shawn
49,00:03:18.37,00:03:18.37,just starts trashing Burton. I was insulted.
50,00:03:21.20,00:03:21.20,"You know, it's like, ""How stupid do you think we are?"""
51,00:03:25.27,00:03:25.27,"I mean, you were with him for 13 days."
52,00:03:27.63,00:03:27.63,>> He thought he was better than everyone else on this
53,00:03:29.33,00:03:29.33,"tribe, and that bothered me. We were tight, but you know"
54,00:03:31.23,00:03:31.23,"what? This is not a game about tight,"
55,00:03:33.90,00:03:33.90,"this is a game about strategy, and for me, he was going to get"
56,00:03:36.23,00:03:36.23,"voted out, regardless. So, I placed the vote, and I"
57,00:03:39.53,00:03:39.53,shocked a couple of people who had no idea I was going
58,00:03:41.13,00:03:41.13,to do it. 'Cause he was constantly wanting
59,00:03:42.80,00:03:42.80,"people to do, it his way, Burton's way."
60,00:03:45.93,00:03:45.93,"Y-You know, it's like, well, hello?"
61,00:03:47.77,00:03:47.77,There's more than one person here.
62,00:03:49.50,00:03:49.50,"Michelle is the one right now who's clinging for her life,"
63,00:03:52.20,00:03:52.20,because everyone knows she voted against Christa.
64,00:03:55.23,00:03:55.23,And the other person who voted against Christa's no longer
65,00:03:57.13,00:03:57.13,"here. >> Michelle, everyone here knows"
66,00:03:59.63,00:03:59.63,what name you wrote on that card.
67,00:04:01.07,00:04:01.07,I want you to know it doesn't matter.
68,00:04:02.93,00:04:02.93,It doesn't. It really doesn't.
69,00:04:04.57,00:04:04.57,">> They're saying, ""Oh, now everything's fine."""
70,00:04:07.43,00:04:07.43,"I'm like, ""Everything's fine?"" >> Good night."
71,00:04:11.67,00:04:11.67,>> Good night. I'm in trouble.
72,00:04:15.30,00:04:15.30,I am out here completely by myself.
73,00:04:33.10,00:04:33.10,">> When I first got to the Morgan camp, the beach was"
74,00:04:36.93,00:04:36.93,"pounding away at their shelter. The surf is coming up, and"
75,00:04:40.37,00:04:40.37,"they don't realize that, as the moon is changing, the tide's"
76,00:04:42.77,00:04:42.77,going to raise another two or three feet.
77,00:04:45.57,00:04:45.57,And they're using logs to try and stop the tide from taking
78,00:04:49.77,00:04:49.77,their shelter away. It's not going to work.
79,00:04:54.43,00:04:54.43,You need to tear your shelter down and rebuild your shelter
80,00:04:56.03,00:04:56.03,today. >> Yeah.
81,00:04:57.37,00:04:57.37,"Right now, we decided to go ahead and move our shelter,"
82,00:05:00.40,00:05:00.40,"'cause, according to Rupert, by the time the full moon comes,"
83,00:05:02.80,00:05:02.80,"it's going to... it would have destroyed that shelter, with"
84,00:05:06.30,00:05:06.30,the waves and stuff. And just kind of clear some
85,00:05:09.33,00:05:09.33,"of this stuff out. So, we're going to move our"
86,00:05:12.00,00:05:12.00,"shelter 40 feet inland, more towards the jungle."
87,00:05:15.63,00:05:15.63,">> What... how is this going to be set up, now?"
88,00:05:19.50,00:05:19.50,This is absurd. We haven't actually got hit by
89,00:05:23.13,00:05:23.13,"the water yet, so, my thought's, ""Wait till it becomes a problem,"
90,00:05:27.07,00:05:27.07,"then deal with it."" But they think it's a state of"
91,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"emergency. >> So, what do you think?"
92,00:05:34.87,00:05:34.87,">> Looks good. O.T. said, ""Why don't we just"
93,00:05:37.07,00:05:37.07,"move it straight back, instead of all the way over here?"""
94,00:05:39.37,00:05:39.37,">> Up here to right here. >> I mean, that's a smart idea"
95,00:05:44.13,00:05:44.13,"he had, just move it right here. And this whole fire needs to get"
96,00:05:47.07,00:05:47.07,moved. >> Right this second?
97,00:05:49.63,00:05:49.63,>> There are reasons not to do it over there?
98,00:05:51.87,00:05:51.87,">> But if you guys want it over there, and it's a unanimous"
99,00:05:53.73,00:05:53.73,"vote... well, not a unanimous vote, but..."
100,00:05:56.27,00:05:56.27,>> I just don't agree with moving it close to the jungle.
101,00:05:58.70,00:05:58.70,"We'll get destroyed by mosquitoes, ""A,"" and then"
102,00:06:00.37,00:06:00.37,"potentially get lit up by a snake, ""B."""
103,00:06:03.27,00:06:03.27,">> Osten was pretty aggravated, because he was just wanting to"
104,00:06:06.87,00:06:06.87,move it up from where we were at.
105,00:06:08.90,00:06:08.90,"But that way, we're going to have to dig up the whole fire"
106,00:06:10.90,00:06:10.90,pit and move all the logs. >> Oh.
107,00:06:14.70,00:06:14.70,>> These guys work very hard at not working.
108,00:06:18.73,00:06:18.73,They fight and argue and bicker and bitch amongst each other
109,00:06:21.87,00:06:21.87,so much that I know why it takes them hours to do anything.
110,00:06:25.67,00:06:25.67,I know why they don't really do great in the challenges.
111,00:06:28.23,00:06:28.23,I know why they're not really a great team.
112,00:06:30.27,00:06:30.27,">> Make a vote, I guess. Who's for here?"
113,00:06:38.07,00:06:38.07,">> Osten, he had an idea, and everybody kind of shot it down."
114,00:06:41.40,00:06:41.40,"We're going to move our shelter a little bit inland, more"
115,00:06:44.27,00:06:44.27,"towards the jungle, a little bit higher ground."
116,00:06:47.17,00:06:47.17,>> Let's go. >> It's kind of like remodeling
117,00:06:56.23,00:06:56.23,a house with four bad walls. >> I want a can of something.
118,00:07:15.57,00:07:15.57,">> Well, don't we have an extra can of Spam?"
119,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17,>> Yeah. >> We do?
120,00:07:18.50,00:07:18.50,(mutters) Are we going to wait for Rupert
121,00:07:20.63,00:07:20.63,before we open that? >> Yep.
122,00:07:22.87,00:07:22.87,>> I hope we get him back. >> Yeah.
123,00:07:25.67,00:07:25.67,>> Rupert right now is with the Morgan Tribe.
124,00:07:28.00,00:07:28.00,He's got to sort of hang out with the enemy and get to know
125,00:07:30.07,00:07:30.07,them a little bit. My concern with Rupert is that
126,00:07:32.23,00:07:32.23,I'm afraid he's giving away too much information about us
127,00:07:35.87,00:07:35.87,"and not realizing it. >> Well, you know they're"
128,00:07:38.33,00:07:38.33,telling that the Morgans are just like...
129,00:07:40.23,00:07:40.23,"(scoffs) ""You're... you're safe with us."""
130,00:07:44.10,00:07:44.10,"You know, anything in the world. >> Buttering him up?"
131,00:07:47.57,00:07:47.57,">> Mm-hmm. >> I want Rupert back, 'cause I"
132,00:07:50.47,00:07:50.47,"want to find out what all happened over there, what they"
133,00:07:52.60,00:07:52.60,"talked about, um, if he gave out any pertinent information..."
134,00:07:56.33,00:07:56.33,"Everybody's kind of, um, tripping."
135,00:07:58.70,00:07:58.70,They don't know if Rupert went to the other side.
136,00:08:00.50,00:08:00.50,>> Three days is a long time to spend with another tribe.
137,00:08:13.27,00:08:13.27,>> I've been dying of thirst since I've been here.
138,00:08:15.57,00:08:15.57,I've been hungry since I've been here.
139,00:08:18.20,00:08:18.20,"Maybe, at least for lunch, I can get a... a belly full of fish."
140,00:08:21.30,00:08:21.30,">> Rupert, you see all those fish jumping out there?"
141,00:08:24.33,00:08:24.33,I think they're waiting for you. >> I know they are.
142,00:08:27.33,00:08:27.33,"I'm hoping to take Ryan out there, and I'll swim around"
143,00:08:30.23,00:08:30.23,with him and just kind of be his buddy and see if he can go
144,00:08:33.63,00:08:33.63,catch a fish. >> I thought you had to throw it
145,00:08:35.43,00:08:35.43,"down, and... >> No, no."
146,00:08:36.87,00:08:36.87,No throwing. Get it in the crotch of your
147,00:08:39.53,00:08:39.53,"hand. Get it cocked, dive down, get"
148,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60,under a rock. >> That's incredible.
149,00:08:46.33,00:08:46.33,"Thank God we got you over here, 'cause I had no... no idea"
150,00:08:49.67,00:08:49.67,"on that, how that sling deal worked."
151,00:08:52.70,00:08:52.70,">> Ryno? Nice young kid, very willing"
152,00:08:54.80,00:08:54.80,"to learn, wanting to be the provider."
153,00:08:58.43,00:08:58.43,Not knowing how to do the providing.
154,00:09:01.10,00:09:01.10,Willing to learn on the spear. Willing to go out with me.
155,00:09:05.23,00:09:05.23,I'm very comfortable with him. Let's open the bag.
156,00:09:41.03,00:09:41.03,(Rupert yells) >> We had one beautiful one that
157,00:09:47.33,00:09:47.33,"was almost in the bag, and... Ryan lost it, and..."
158,00:09:50.90,00:09:50.90,"I screamed real loud at him, and..."
159,00:09:52.93,00:09:52.93,I feel bad for him. >> We let one go.
160,00:09:56.30,00:09:56.30,It was about this big... or I did.
161,00:09:57.93,00:09:57.93,">> Why'd you let it go? >> I didn't let him go, I was"
162,00:10:01.13,00:10:01.13,trying to get him off the spear. >> He tell you about the ones
163,00:10:04.60,00:10:04.60,that got away? These make it better.
164,00:10:06.90,00:10:06.90,">> Nicely done, fellow! (laughing)"
165,00:10:09.30,00:10:09.30,Nicely done. >> Rupert's been a godsend.
166,00:10:12.40,00:10:12.40,"He's an absolute workaholic, work ethic is impeccable."
167,00:10:15.97,00:10:15.97,">> We eat a little lunch. >> Oh, my God!"
168,00:10:17.90,00:10:17.90,">> I got to... I got to clean and gut them, so..."
169,00:10:19.40,00:10:19.40,>> We'll make... we'll make some lunch.
170,00:10:21.20,00:10:21.20,>> Ah! Mmm...
171,00:10:22.90,00:10:22.90,">> Ah, thank you, baby. >> Probably the smartest thing"
172,00:10:25.37,00:10:25.37,this tribe ever did was get a hold of Rupert.
173,00:10:27.80,00:10:27.80,(chuckles) >> We got tree mail.
174,00:10:53.60,00:10:53.60,">> Tree mail? >> ""Paddle on the clue, does it"
175,00:10:56.57,00:10:56.57,give it all away? Or the foreshadowing of a part
176,00:11:00.60,00:11:00.60,of what you'll face today. Running through the jungle
177,00:11:04.33,00:11:04.33,"for the best reward yet, staying dry when you want to, get"
178,00:11:08.67,00:11:08.67,"cleaner when you're wet."" (gasps)"
179,00:11:12.40,00:11:12.40,">> That tree mail, I'm really excited."
180,00:11:14.17,00:11:14.17,>> It mentioned there's a possibility we would be
181,00:11:17.33,00:11:17.33,clean somehow. So we figured we would
182,00:11:18.70,00:11:18.70,potentially get something that would dry us off and then
183,00:11:21.57,00:11:21.57,something that would keep us clean.
184,00:11:23.43,00:11:23.43,">> I love Drake, and I don't really want to beat them, but I"
185,00:11:26.73,00:11:26.73,"want to beat them bad and show them, you know, the reason that"
186,00:11:29.83,00:11:29.83,they've been winning might have something to do with me.
187,00:11:37.07,00:11:37.07,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Take a spot on your mat."
188,00:11:44.83,00:11:44.83,"Morgan, getting your first look at the new Drake Tribe."

293,00:18:26.87,00:18:26.87,We've proven to ourselves that we can win.
294,00:18:29.07,00:18:29.07,"And I think that's... In this game, it's a mental"
295,00:18:30.97,00:18:30.97,"game, and that's critical. >> I haven't smelled something"

305,00:19:04.63,00:19:04.63,"you know. They wasn't really watching us,"
306,00:19:06.83,00:19:06.83,"so, um, you know, I respect them for respecting us."
307,00:19:09.47,00:19:09.47,"So, you know, if they'll do that every time I take a shower,"
308,00:19:12.43,00:19:12.43,I'm fine with it. >> The Morgan Tribe seems to be
309,00:19:16.63,00:19:16.63,"riding a high, and it's... it's great."
310,00:19:18.90,00:19:18.90,I... I like that. It's... it's a positive

315,00:19:34.27,00:19:34.27,welcome back this guy. >> Yeah.
316,00:19:37.10,00:19:37.10,"I love being back home. When Jeff said, ""You can enjoy"

318,00:19:44.67,00:19:44.67,I didn't look back. I come home.
319,00:19:46.57,00:19:46.57,I didn't need to go share in the loot.
320,00:19:48.80,00:19:48.80,I need to go bond with my tribe. >> How was Jenny Craig Island?

327,00:20:03.50,00:20:03.50,"and that's all they have left. Osten doesn't get in the water,"

330,00:20:12.30,00:20:12.30,the whole time? >> They knew I was not going
331,00:20:13.77,00:20:13.77,anywhere. They know that a Drake is going
332,00:20:16.03,00:20:16.03,to win this whole damn thing. (indistinct chatter)
333,00:20:18.53,00:20:18.53,"Thank God, I am so happy I am back."

339,00:20:40.27,00:20:40.27,>> Big Jon. What's up?
340,00:20:43.93,00:20:43.93,>> Welcome to Drakeland. >> Good to see you.

349,00:21:06.83,00:21:06.83,You got about this much? >> Probably half.
350,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,>> You got about half of this? >> Yeah.
351,00:21:11.70,00:21:11.70,Honestly. >> I know.
352,00:21:14.17,00:21:14.17,"You can say, ""This is good."" You can say, ""Give me more."""
353,00:21:16.87,00:21:16.87,"You can say, ""Give me that."" >> I can take that whole thing?"
354,00:21:19.37,00:21:19.37,">> Yeah. Of course, I'll kill you..."

357,00:21:29.33,00:21:29.33,little more rice in here? I will.
358,00:21:31.97,00:21:31.97,"I poured two more bowls full of rice in his bag, and he was"
359,00:21:35.47,00:21:35.47,happy. That truly was not a looting.
360,00:21:39.33,00:21:39.33,That was friends helping friends.
361,00:21:43.03,00:21:43.03,">> All right, you guys, I got to go."
362,00:21:44.57,00:21:44.57,>> Okay. >> Thanks so much.

364,00:21:48.63,00:21:48.63,>> There is probably a lot of danger in being too much in
365,00:21:51.50,00:21:51.50,control of both tribes. Who knows what my own tribe even
366,00:21:57.73,00:21:57.73,"thinks of me, but if I push too hard, I will end up alienating"
367,00:22:01.47,00:22:01.47,"someone. >> Thanks, guys, so much."

370,00:22:09.87,00:22:09.87,>> All right. I think this speaks volumes on
371,00:22:12.50,00:22:12.50,"diplomacy, and, uh, there'll be no hard feelings, because"
372,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97,"I'm hoping, ultimately, in the next handful of days, to be"
373,00:22:19.47,00:22:19.47,"part of their tribe. >> Got to love the sea mail,"
374,00:22:33.00,00:22:33.00,huh? Uh-oh.
375,00:22:37.20,00:22:37.20,"We got something. All right, here it comes."

569,00:32:45.10,00:32:45.10,>> You did beautiful. >> I am so worried because I
570,00:32:47.83,00:32:47.83,feel like it's my fault that we lost the immunity challenge.
571,00:32:50.70,00:32:50.70,I just couldn't get the sardine down.
572,00:32:52.67,00:32:52.67,"Why did they have to pick me? >> I don't know, man."
573,00:32:55.70,00:32:55.70,"I should have played it up more. >> And so, I feel when we go"
574,00:32:59.03,00:32:59.03,"to Tribal Council tonight that, why shouldn't I be the one going"
575,00:33:01.33,00:33:01.33,home if this is all my fault? Nobody wants to be the cause of
576,00:33:05.47,00:33:05.47,the tribe going to Tribal Council.
577,00:33:08.23,00:33:08.23,">> Dude, it doesn't matter. It's okay."
578,00:33:09.87,00:33:09.87,"I mean, you did your best. That's all you can do, right?"
579,00:33:12.63,00:33:12.63,>> All of that is easy to say when you're not on the chopping
580,00:33:14.97,00:33:14.97,block. Lord have mercy.
581,00:33:18.63,00:33:18.63,>> I'm pissed the ... off. That was the easiest...
582,00:33:21.93,00:33:21.93,"challenge we, easiest challenge we'll have the"
583,00:33:23.80,00:33:23.80,entire ... game. I feel like the last immunity
584,00:33:27.07,00:33:27.07,"challenge was mind over matter. Obviously, a sardine is bigger"
585,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"than Sandra's mind. Secondly, I'm extremely pissed"
586,00:33:35.90,00:33:35.90,off at Michelle. Michelle was planning on
587,00:33:39.30,00:33:39.30,pretending as though she would be the worst in the bunch when
588,00:33:43.20,00:33:43.20,in reality she was technically the best.
589,00:33:45.97,00:33:45.97,>> I almost fell off my chair when she chugged that thing.
590,00:33:48.40,00:33:48.40,The plan was she was supposed to gag that down.
591,00:33:51.37,00:33:51.37,">> But her freakin' ego wouldn't let her do it, and, uh... that's"
592,00:33:55.57,00:33:55.57,what I feel about her ego right now.
593,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,>> You and I know about these physical challenges.
594,00:34:03.43,00:34:03.43,You know what I mean? >> Yep.
595,00:34:05.90,00:34:05.90,>> Michelle can run. >> I know.
596,00:34:08.20,00:34:08.20,But this isn't the time right now to talk about it.
597,00:34:10.03,00:34:10.03,">> I know, but you know what I'm saying."
598,00:34:11.63,00:34:11.63,>> I know. >> I'm thinking about winning.
599,00:34:14.40,00:34:14.40,"We need to. >> We're back two damn minutes,"
600,00:34:17.77,00:34:17.77,and he's already trying to get somebody out.
601,00:34:19.80,00:34:19.80,"He better watch out, or it'll be him."
602,00:34:24.53,00:34:24.53,>> What are you thinking about? (grunts)
603,00:34:27.93,00:34:27.93,I know majority goes me. I'm-I'm just having big
604,00:34:31.57,00:34:31.57,"problems. It just, it bothers me that..."
605,00:34:35.80,00:34:35.80,"we have maybe one more challenge before the merge, and Shawn,"
606,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,"who is, you know, just... I can't trust him further than"
607,00:34:47.23,00:34:47.23,"I could throw him. >> You know, they say that he"
608,00:34:51.40,00:34:51.40,"did something when I'm gone. But when I'm here, he does"
609,00:34:52.97,00:34:52.97,"nothing, and he eats more than anybody."
610,00:34:54.77,00:34:54.77,He does nothing. (gagging)
611,00:35:07.90,00:35:07.90,What could we say to convince people to vote for Shawn and
612,00:35:11.83,00:35:11.83,convince them that we don't need the damn strength of Shawn
613,00:35:14.50,00:35:14.50,'cause he's not that strong anyway?
614,00:35:16.63,00:35:16.63,"(coughing) >> There's, like, one more"
615,00:35:22.20,00:35:22.20,challenge. >> Michelle feels like she is
616,00:35:28.97,00:35:28.97,going. She is trying to make a plea
617,00:35:34.10,00:35:34.10,"that she works as hard, if not harder, than Shawn, and she"
618,00:35:38.77,00:35:38.77,eats lots less. She never takes more than her
619,00:35:41.20,00:35:41.20,share. >> My point is that once the
620,00:35:43.90,00:35:43.90,"merge comes, which will happen really soon..."
621,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,>> I know. >> ...it just doesn't seem to
622,00:35:48.07,00:35:48.07,make sense to me that people would want him around at the
623,00:35:52.10,00:35:52.10,merge rather than myself. >> She swayed me enough that I
624,00:35:56.40,00:35:56.40,will mention it to others. Do we want to take Shawn out of
625,00:35:58.97,00:35:58.97,this game? It's day 15-- he was our first
626,00:36:01.37,00:36:01.37,pick on day two. >> PROBST: What a difference a
627,00:36:25.57,00:36:25.57,"few days can make. In the last four days, you've"
628,00:36:28.47,00:36:28.47,"lost three challenges and, by the end of the night, two"
629,00:36:31.17,00:36:31.17,members. Sandra... you got selected to be
630,00:36:34.80,00:36:34.80,in the tiebreaker. Gave it a great effort.
631,00:36:39.57,00:36:39.57,It wasn't enough. Are you worried that it might
632,00:36:42.27,00:36:42.27,"be you tonight? >> If it's me, I know why."
633,00:36:45.83,00:36:45.83,Then I'll deal with it. I'm just sorry.
634,00:36:49.63,00:36:49.63,That's all I can say. >> PROBST: Is this tribe
635,00:36:52.70,00:36:52.70,starting to splinter a little bit?
636,00:36:54.30,00:36:54.30,"Is that a fair assessment, losing this many challenges"
637,00:36:56.30,00:36:56.30,in a row? >> No.
638,00:36:58.07,00:36:58.07,We-we didn't expect to lose this challenge here.
639,00:37:00.63,00:37:00.63,And I've apologized to the tribe a couple of times today because
640,00:37:03.77,00:37:03.77,of the fact that I didn't pull through it.
641,00:37:05.97,00:37:05.97,"We didn't even plan to lose this challenge but, you know, things"
642,00:37:08.40,00:37:08.40,happen. >> PROBST: Let's talk about the
643,00:37:11.40,00:37:11.40,challenges since we-we jumped to that.
644,00:37:13.43,00:37:13.43,Let's go back to the last reward challenge.
645,00:37:15.30,00:37:15.30,"From where I'm looking at it, Jon, you didn't know if you had"
646,00:37:18.00,00:37:18.00,a rudder or a paddle or what to do with it.
647,00:37:20.57,00:37:20.57,"Was that discussed among the tribe, or was that just an"
648,00:37:23.30,00:37:23.30,"observation I saw? >> Uh, the last reward challenge"
649,00:37:26.27,00:37:26.27,was the first challenge of all the challenges that we actually
650,00:37:30.67,00:37:30.67,"lost, as far as, uh, we saw it."
651,00:37:33.97,00:37:33.97,">> PROBST: Okay, what do you mean, ""as far as we saw it""?"
652,00:37:36.93,00:37:36.93,"'Cause, we went through this charade last time."
653,00:37:38.80,00:37:38.80,">> Well, last time, we felt, uh, that no one really needed to"
654,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,"know until it was time to be told, uh, what was really"
655,00:37:45.47,00:37:45.47,going on. >> PROBST: So now that you've
656,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,"lost three in a row, you want to come clean and say, ""Well, we"
657,00:37:49.80,00:37:49.80,"actually didn't lose the first one, we threw it."""
658,00:37:51.93,00:37:51.93,">> Yeah, absolutely. >> PROBST: My point is, throwing"
659,00:37:54.77,00:37:54.77,a challenge in a game like this is really cocky.
660,00:37:58.33,00:37:58.33,"Michelle, is there a part of you that, looking back now, says,"
661,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,"""You know, by throwing a challenge, we gave them the"
662,00:38:04.47,00:38:04.47,ability to believe in themselves.
663,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,"Now we're the ones scrambling to get back, and they are the"
664,00:38:09.37,00:38:09.37,"powerhouse in their mind""? >> Uh, that's a load of crap."
665,00:38:14.10,00:38:14.10,"Um, I don't think that how much they built up themselves for"
666,00:38:17.50,00:38:17.50,winning that one challenge and then continuing for two after
667,00:38:19.90,00:38:19.90,that is enough to keep on winning.
668,00:38:23.37,00:38:23.37,"Um, I don't expect that Drake will have to lose to Morgan"
669,00:38:25.63,00:38:25.63,again. >> When they decided to throw
670,00:38:28.90,00:38:28.90,"that damn challenge, I knew it was the worst mistake in the"
671,00:38:32.57,00:38:32.57,"world, but I could not convince them."
672,00:38:36.93,00:38:36.93,"If we would not have thrown that challenge, we would have not"
673,00:38:40.13,00:38:40.13,lost the immunity. We would have not lost the
674,00:38:42.13,00:38:42.13,rewards. I would have not had to go to
675,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,Morgan. The one good thing about going
676,00:38:46.70,00:38:46.70,"to Morgan, I learned a lot about them."
677,00:38:52.57,00:38:52.57,"If I can take what I learned and use it against them, then"
678,00:38:56.67,00:38:56.67,"maybe, you know, we got some good out of it."
679,00:38:59.77,00:38:59.77,>> PROBST: Fair enough. It is time to vote.
680,00:39:02.63,00:39:02.63,Shawn. You're up.
681,00:39:17.33,00:39:17.33,">> If anybody was going to jump ship, buddy, I think it's you."
682,00:39:21.37,00:39:21.37,"Hope you don't. >> You're a good girl, but say"
683,00:39:45.13,00:39:45.13,hello to the bad guy. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
684,00:39:59.77,00:39:59.77,votes. (man singing in foreign
685,00:40:01.80,00:40:01.80,language) >> PROBST: Once the votes are
686,00:40:15.30,00:40:15.30,"read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked"
687,00:40:17.70,00:40:17.70,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
688,00:40:19.60,00:40:19.60,I'll read the votes. First vote...
689,00:40:25.87,00:40:25.87,Michelle. Shawn.
690,00:40:37.50,00:40:37.50,Michelle. That's two votes Michelle.
691,00:40:43.43,00:40:43.43,Michelle. That's three.
692,00:40:51.60,00:40:51.60,Second person voted out of the Drake Tribe:
693,00:40:53.60,00:40:53.60,Michelle. That's four votes.
694,00:40:56.00,00:40:56.00,That's enough. Last two votes will remain a
695,00:40:58.67,00:40:58.67,"mystery. Michelle, the tribe has spoken."
696,00:41:11.27,00:41:11.27,"It's time for you to go. Grab your torches, head back to"
697,00:41:24.37,00:41:24.37,camp. Good night.
698,00:41:37.07,00:41:37.07,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
699,00:41:43.37,00:41:43.37,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
700,00:41:44.97,00:41:44.97,The Morgan Tribe has an unexpected visitor.
701,00:41:46.77,00:41:46.77,(screaming) >> I don't like animals.
702,00:41:48.97,00:41:48.97,I've been bit by a couple animals.
703,00:41:50.83,00:41:50.83,"(squawking) >> PROBST: And at Drake, tempers"
704,00:41:53.10,00:41:53.10,"fly. >> No, what's ... ridiculous is"
705,00:41:55.47,00:41:55.47,"not doing anything! >> Jon, just shut up, all right!"
706,00:41:59.73,00:41:59.73,">> Maybe Shawn should get a clue, or he's going home."
707,00:42:08.47,00:42:08.47,">> I'm really upset that I came all this way, but it didn't"
708,00:42:12.23,00:42:12.23,happen. I think I have learned stuff
709,00:42:14.33,00:42:14.33,"about myself. When things suck, and you're in"
710,00:42:16.67,00:42:16.67,crappy situations and being able to carry through it.
711,00:42:19.43,00:42:19.43,And I learned how much I can deal with.
712,00:42:21.27,00:42:21.27,"But regardless of all the politics, wish I could have been"
713,00:42:23.93,00:42:23.93,here longer-- just had more time to kick some butt and really
714,00:42:26.80,00:42:26.80,get into the game.
