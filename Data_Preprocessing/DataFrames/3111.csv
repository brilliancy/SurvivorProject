663,00:30:53.80,00:30:53.80,"MATCH, YOU KNOW, BRAZIL AGAINST GERMANY."
664,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,"AND TO SEE JOE THE AMAZING LOSE TO A 52-YEAR-OLD MAN, IT WAS"
665,00:31:01.87,00:31:01.87,AWESOME.
666,00:31:02.30,00:31:02.30,"AND NOW, IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO."
667,00:31:11.07,00:31:11.07,">> OH, SHE DOES!"

673,00:31:20.23,00:31:20.23,>> SO WE GET RID OF JOE AND THEN WE DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR US.
674,00:31:24.43,00:31:24.43,"THE FACT THAT JOE PUSHED HIMSELF UNTIL HE PASSED OUT, THAT IS"
675,00:31:28.87,00:31:28.87,FRIGHTENING.
676,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,"BECAUSE, LIKE, I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT."
677,00:31:31.30,00:31:31.30,SO HE'S GOT TO GO.
678,00:31:32.77,00:31:32.77,"ONCE WE GET HIM OUT OF HERE, THE GIRLS ARE IN CONTROL OF THIS"
679,00:31:36.93,00:31:36.93,GAME.

687,00:31:52.67,00:31:52.67,STILL HERE.
688,00:31:53.70,00:31:53.70,SO I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT I CAN DO IT AGAIN.
689,00:31:58.33,00:31:58.33,"AT THIS POINT IN THE THE GAME, LIKE, I'M THINKING WHO'S THE"
690,00:32:01.97,00:32:01.97,MOST DANGEROUS PERSON TO JUST GET TO THE END.
691,00:32:05.03,00:32:05.03,"HANDS DOWN, ABI."
692,00:32:07.70,00:32:07.70,JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
693,00:32:08.53,00:32:08.53,"IN EVERYONE'S MIND, THEY WANT TO SIT NEXT TO ABI."
694,00:32:11.10,00:32:11.10,"AND WITH EVERY VOTE THAT SHE'S NOT VOTED OUT, SHE BECOMES MORE"
695,00:32:14.83,00:32:14.83,AND MORE DANGEROUS TO MAKE IT TO THE END.
696,00:32:16.73,00:32:16.73,">> YEAH, THAT'S TRUE."
697,00:32:18.17,00:32:18.17,SITTING NEXT TO ABI WOULD BE EASY MONEY.
698,00:32:19.93,00:32:19.93,>> EXACTLY.
699,00:32:21.53,00:32:21.53,I WANT PLAYERS TO GO TO THE END.
700,00:32:22.87,00:32:22.87,>> YEAH.
701,00:32:23.47,00:32:23.47,I HEAR YOU.
702,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,WRIERKS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS I NEED ABI OUT OF THIS GAME AND
703,00:32:30.17,00:32:30.17,"JEREMY'S A SMART GUY, SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO STICK, AND I THINK"
704,00:32:33.33,00:32:33.33,IT DID STICK.
705,00:32:37.80,00:32:37.80,>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
706,00:32:38.93,00:32:38.93,"BECAUSE, I MEAN, IT'S EASY TO BE LIKE, ""LET'S GET JOE OUT."""
707,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,>> YEAH.
708,00:32:47.20,00:32:47.20,>> HERE'S THE THING.
709,00:32:49.37,00:32:49.37,THE GIRLS WANT TO DO AN ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE.
710,00:32:53.33,00:32:53.33,BUT YOU GUYS HAVE TO TRUST IT WILL NOT BE ALL GIRLS.
711,00:32:57.77,00:32:57.77,I'VE BEEN LOCKED IN SINCE DAY ONE.
712,00:33:00.77,00:33:00.77,AND THAT'S IT.
713,00:33:02.40,00:33:02.40,">> I WAS PLANNING ON VOTING OUT JOE, AND THEN TASHA TELLS ME"
714,00:33:06.57,00:33:06.57,THIS TALK ABOUT AN ALL GIRLS' ALLIANCE.
715,00:33:10.10,00:33:10.10,"OH, MY GOD."
716,00:33:15.00,00:33:15.00,>> ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUSLY NERVOUS ABOUT THIS ALL-GIRL
717,00:33:17.97,00:33:17.97,THING?
718,00:33:18.47,00:33:18.47,>> NO.
719,00:33:19.93,00:33:19.93,I'M NOT NERVOUS ABOUT THE ALL GIRLS.
720,00:33:22.10,00:33:22.10,IT'S JUST SO QUIET RIGHT NOW.
721,00:33:23.30,00:33:23.30,>> IT IS A LITTLE CALM.
722,00:33:24.23,00:33:24.23,>> IT'S NEVER THIS EASY.
723,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,>> SO I TOLD JEREMY AND SPENCER ABOUT THE ALL-GIRL ALLIANCE
724,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK HAVING THEM FIND OUT ABOUT IT
725,00:33:32.03,00:33:32.03,FROM SOMEONE ELSE.
726,00:33:33.60,00:33:33.60,BECAUSE THAT WOULD CREATE DISTRUST.
727,00:33:36.50,00:33:36.50,"HOWEVER, ALL I DID WAS MAKE THEM SUSPICIOUS, WHICH COULD MEAN"
728,00:33:40.73,00:33:40.73,TROUBLE.
729,00:33:54.33,00:33:54.33,>> I'M CONCERNED EITHER WAY.
730,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,"IF WE KEEP JOE, I'M TERRIFIED."
731,00:33:58.93,00:33:58.93,"IF WE GET RID OF JOE, I'M TERRIFIED."
732,00:34:01.53,00:34:01.53,>> YEAH.
733,00:34:04.03,00:34:04.03,"OH, MY GOD."
734,00:34:05.23,00:34:05.23,>> THE PROBLEM IS I'M NOT 100% CONVINCED THAT TASHA'S IDEA OF
735,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,FINAL THREE WITH MYSELF AND JEREMY.
736,00:34:13.10,00:34:13.10,"TASHA MIGHT HAVE THE THOUGHT IN HER HEAD, I CAN BEAT AN ABI."
737,00:34:15.90,00:34:15.90,I CAN BEAT A KIMMI.
738,00:34:18.17,00:34:18.17,I CAN BEAT WENTWORTH.
739,00:34:19.10,00:34:19.10,SO WE HAVE TO SQUASH THESE GIRLS BEFORE THEY GET ANYTHING
740,00:34:23.33,00:34:23.33,STARTED.
741,00:34:23.57,00:34:23.57,">> IF WE CAN GET KEITH, AND IF WE STILL HAVE JOE."
742,00:34:27.27,00:34:27.27,>> BUT WHO'S THE FIFTH?
743,00:34:28.77,00:34:28.77,WE NEED TASHA.
744,00:34:29.97,00:34:29.97,">> WE'VE GOT TO LOCK HER IN, THEN."
745,00:34:32.63,00:34:32.63,"IF THOSE GIRLS TAKE OVER THE AME, H ME AND SPENCER, WE'RE ALL"
746,00:34:38.47,00:34:38.47,DONE.
747,00:34:38.83,00:34:38.83,OUR GAMES ARE OVER.
748,00:34:40.20,00:34:40.20,SO HAVING TASHA ON MY SIDE IS CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW.
749,00:34:44.20,00:34:44.20,">> OKAY, SO, YOU VOTE OUT ABI."
750,00:34:46.77,00:34:46.77,"AND THAT LEAVES JOE IN THE GAME, AND THEN HE WINS OUT."
751,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,>> YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WIN OUT?
752,00:34:52.60,00:34:52.60,>> YOU COULDN'T BEAT HIM TODAY.
753,00:34:56.03,00:34:56.03,SPENCER COULDN'T BEAT HIM TODAY.
754,00:34:57.73,00:34:57.73,"JOE ESCAPED ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL, AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO ESCAPE"

756,00:35:01.10,00:35:01.10,"BUT AT THIS POINT, IT'S A STALEMATE."
757,00:35:04.97,00:35:04.97,>> WHAT IS THAT POWWOW ABOUT?
758,00:35:06.73,00:35:06.73,>> ARE PEOPLE STILL WRITING JOE?
759,00:35:08.13,00:35:08.13,>> I KNOW TASHA IS 100%.
760,00:35:10.43,00:35:10.43,I DON'T WANT TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING
761,00:35:13.77,00:35:13.77,TO HAPPEN.
762,00:35:14.37,00:35:14.37,SO WE NEED TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT.
763,00:35:17.43,00:35:17.43,"WE'RE ANYTHING TO BE MAKING A MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION, AND I'M"
764,00:35:20.33,00:35:20.33,NERVOUS AS HELL ABOUT THAT.
765,00:35:39.47,00:35:39.47,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
766,00:35:43.80,00:35:43.80,KASS.
767,00:35:46.97,00:35:46.97,SAVAGE.

771,00:35:56.07,00:35:56.07,"JOE, ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENTS IN ""SURVIVOR"" HISTORY"
772,00:35:59.53,00:35:59.53,TODAY WHEN YOU DROPPED.
773,00:36:02.13,00:36:02.13,HOW ARE YOU FEEL?
774,00:36:03.90,00:36:03.90,>> I'M OKAY.
775,00:36:06.87,00:36:06.87,I'M NOT GREAT BY ANY MEANS.
776,00:36:08.03,00:36:08.03,"I MEAN, I'VE PUSHED MYSELF."

778,00:36:12.33,00:36:12.33,AND IT'S-- IT'S HUMBLING.
779,00:36:14.33,00:36:14.33,"I HAVE MY BREAKING POINT, TOO."
780,00:36:17.00,00:36:17.00,">> Jeff: KIMMI, WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU SAW THAT?"

783,00:36:25.63,00:36:25.63,"AND TO SEE SOMEBODY GO DOWN, I MEAN, IT WAS FRIGHTENING FOR US."
784,00:36:29.30,00:36:29.30,">> Jeff: SO, WENTWORTH, ONCE YOU REALIZED HE'S GOING TO BE"
785,00:36:32.60,00:36:32.60,"OKAY, HOW QUICKLY DOES YOUR BRAIN GO, ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA BE"
786,00:36:36.63,00:36:36.63,HONEST.
787,00:36:36.87,00:36:36.87,I AM IN A GAME.
788,00:36:37.37,00:36:37.37,">> YEAH, I MEAN, IT DEFINITELY CROSSES YOUR MIND."
789,00:36:39.60,00:36:39.60,"I MEAN, HE STOOD THERE UNTIL HE PASSED OUT."
790,00:36:43.60,00:36:43.60,"LIKE, HE COULD COTHAT IN ANY CHALLENGE AND BEAT ALL OF US TO"
791,00:36:46.63,00:36:46.63,THE END.
792,00:36:47.07,00:36:47.07,"I MEAN, IT HAD TO HAVE CROSSED EVERYONE'S MIND LIKE, HOLY CRAP."
793,00:36:51.10,00:36:51.10,THESE GUYS WILL LITERALLY PASS OUT TO WIN A CHALLENGE.
794,00:36:53.93,00:36:53.93,">> Jeff: JEREMY, ARE YOU ABLE, ALSO, TO SAY, BACK TO GAME MODE?"
795,00:36:57.57,00:36:57.57,DUDE DOES NOT HAVE IMMUNITY?
796,00:36:58.73,00:36:58.73,">> YEAH, I MEAN, AS SOON AS YOU FIND OUT THAT HE'S ALL RIGHT,"
797,00:37:01.87,00:37:01.87,"YOU START THINKING, ALL RIGHT, JOE, DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY."
798,00:37:04.23,00:37:04.23,DO WE TAKE HIM OUT?
799,00:37:05.53,00:37:05.53,"BUT YOU HAVE A GAME PLAN, AND IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO CHANGE"
800,00:37:08.63,00:37:08.63,JUST BECAUSE JOE DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY.
801,00:37:10.70,00:37:10.70,YOU CAN'T HAVE BLINDERS ON.
802,00:37:12.27,00:37:12.27,BECAUSE THESE NEXT FEW VOTES ARE-- ARE CRUCIAL.
803,00:37:15.47,00:37:15.47,>> CRUCIAL.
