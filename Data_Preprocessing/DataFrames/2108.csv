106,00:04:44.88,00:04:44.88,AND THAT MEANS HE HAS TO GO FIRST.
107,00:04:46.12,00:04:46.12,>> AND HE HAS AN IDOL.
108,00:04:47.33,00:04:47.33,>> AND HE HAS AN IDOL SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE
109,00:04:48.54,00:04:48.54,TO DO A MAJOR BLIND-SIDE.

117,00:05:11.62,00:05:11.62,IF SHE DOESN'T GET THE IMMUNITY FIRST.
118,00:05:13.12,00:05:13.12,SHE CAN BE G.I. JANE ALL SHE WANTS BUT SHE WILL
119,00:05:15.29,00:05:15.29,"BE G.I. JANE ALL BY HERSELF WITH NO ARMY, NOBODY BEHIND HER."

129,00:05:35.33,00:05:35.33,AND IT TELLS US A LOT THAT JILL WAS VOTED OUT.

201,00:08:27.46,00:08:27.46,MAYBE MARTY IS SMART AND HE'S STRONG
202,00:08:29.12,00:08:29.12,BUT IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS GUNNING.
203,00:08:30.46,00:08:30.46,>> I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.
204,00:08:31.96,00:08:31.96,SHE KNOWS WITH ME IT'S 100%.
205,00:08:34.54,00:08:34.54,"SO SASH CAME UP WITH A BRILLIANT IDEA TO ASK HIM FOR THE IDOL,"
206,00:08:38.50,00:08:38.50,TO GIVE IT TO SASH.
207,00:08:40.25,00:08:40.25,>> DOES SASH HAVE IT?
208,00:08:41.58,00:08:41.58,>> SASH HAS THE IDOL.
209,00:08:42.42,00:08:42.42,>> OH!
210,00:08:43.71,00:08:43.71,GET OUT OF HERE!
211,00:08:45.12,00:08:45.12,>> HE DID IT.
212,00:08:46.08,00:08:46.08,">> BRENDA, THE ONE THAT WAS WITH ME AND I FOUND"
213,00:08:47.92,00:08:47.92,"THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL, SASH ASKED MARTY FOR"
214,00:08:51.62,00:08:51.62,AND IT HE GAVE IT TO HIM.
215,00:08:53.54,00:08:53.54,THE SOONER WE GET ALINA AND MARTY OUT
216,00:08:55.29,00:08:55.29,THE SMOOTHER THE GAME WILL GO.
217,00:08:56.79,00:08:56.79,>> WE'LL BE ABLE TO KNOCK THEM OUT ONE BY ONE BY ONE BY ONE.
218,00:08:59.12,00:08:59.12,>> THIS IS GOING TO GET REAL WEIRD.
219,00:09:00.96,00:09:00.96,>> THIS IS GOING TO GET WICKED.
220,00:09:03.21,00:09:03.21,>> I'M DEAD SERIOUS.
221,00:09:16.96,00:09:16.96,">> I LOVE THE STATE OF GEORGIA, REALLY."
222,00:09:18.50,00:09:18.50,>> WE'VE GOT A CREEK BELOW OUR HOUSE.
223,00:09:20.29,00:09:20.29,68 STEPS TO GO DOWN THERE.
224,00:09:23.21,00:09:23.21,"I WAS RUNNING THAT 10 TIMES A DAY GETTING IN SHAPE FOR THIS,"
225,00:09:26.54,00:09:26.54,"RUNNING THREE MILES A DAY AND SWIMMING, TOO."
226,00:09:32.96,00:09:32.96,>> YOU SEEM LIKE A REAL COOL LADY.
227,00:09:35.62,00:09:35.62,">> HONEY, YOU CAN STAY AT MY HOUSE ANY TIME."
228,00:09:38.12,00:09:38.12,"EVEN IF I'M NOT THERE, THE DOOR IS ALREADY OPEN."
229,00:09:40.50,00:09:40.50,"GOT TURKEYS, GOT A DOG THAT LIVES IN THE YARD."
230,00:09:45.12,00:09:45.12,"I FEEL VERY SAFE PLUS I HAVE A SHOTGUN, A .22."
231,00:09:50.54,00:09:50.54,>> JANE AND I CLICKED RIGHT AWAY.
232,00:09:52.29,00:09:52.29,"SHE'S A GOOD, OLD LADY."
233,00:09:54.29,00:09:54.29,SHE'S AN AWESOME LADY.
234,00:09:55.42,00:09:55.42,SHE TALKS WITH A TWANG.
235,00:09:56.71,00:09:56.71,SHE REMINDS ME AT HOME.
236,00:09:57.88,00:09:57.88,I MISS MY HOME.
237,00:09:58.71,00:09:58.71,I MISS MY MOTHER.
238,00:10:00.00,00:10:00.00,HER AND I CAN CONNECT VERY WELL.
239,00:10:04.12,00:10:04.12,>> THEY TREATED ME LIKE I WAS THE UGLY DUCKLING OVER HERE
240,00:10:07.29,00:10:07.29,BECAUSE I HAD A SOUTHERN ACCENT AND I'M A RED NECK.
241,00:10:10.21,00:10:10.21,>> I HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE SO BAD.
242,00:10:11.67,00:10:11.67,I LOVE A NORTH CAROLINA GIRL.
243,00:10:14.50,00:10:14.50,PEOPLE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER.
244,00:10:16.96,00:10:16.96,">> AND I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE,"
245,00:10:18.33,00:10:18.33,"YOU'RE A NORTH CAROLINA BOY, I'M A NORTH CAROLINA GIRL,"
246,00:10:20.38,00:10:20.38,WE'RE GOING TO HIT IT OFF REALLY GOOD.
247,00:10:22.67,00:10:22.67,AND I WAS TALKING TO CHASE ABOUT HIS DAD PASSING
248,00:10:25.29,00:10:25.29,"AND MY HUSBAND PASSING, SO I'VE GOT A CONNECTION WITH HIM,"
249,00:10:29.25,00:10:29.25,WITH CHASE.
250,00:10:35.08,00:10:35.08,>> WHAT ARE WE DOING?
251,00:10:36.21,00:10:36.21,"BREAKFAST, HUH?"
252,00:10:41.21,00:10:41.21,">> DON'T TAKE A BIG ASS BITE, EITHER."
253,00:10:44.96,00:10:44.96,">> HEY, IS THIS COOL?"
254,00:10:46.08,00:10:46.08,NAONKA?
255,00:10:48.38,00:10:48.38,">> I GUESS, I DON'T KNOW."
256,00:10:51.38,00:10:51.38,"IT'S DAY 20, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FOOD LEFT AND I WOKE UP"
257,00:10:55.33,00:10:55.33,THIS MORNING VERY IRRITABLE.
258,00:10:56.75,00:10:56.75,IT WAS MY IDEA TO MAKE THE TORTILLAS AND THE FACT
259,00:11:01.04,00:11:01.04,THAT I'M THE LAST TO GET EVERYTHING
260,00:11:03.21,00:11:03.21,AND I GET THE SMALLEST TORTILLA.
261,00:11:05.04,00:11:05.04,"OKAY, YOU GUYS WANT TO PLAY."
262,00:11:06.04,00:11:06.04,"I CAN PLAY, TOO."
263,00:11:07.17,00:11:07.17,">> DON'T TAKE A BIG BITE, FABIO."
264,00:11:12.17,00:11:12.17,>> I JUST WANTED IT TEST IT OUT YOU KNOW.
265,00:11:18.21,00:11:18.21,">> THIS MORNING, AFTER WE WERE DONE EATING BREAKFAST,"
266,00:11:20.29,00:11:20.29,"NA TOOK THE FLOUR AND PUT IT IN HER BAG,"
267,00:11:23.54,00:11:23.54,AND SHE GOT UP AND SHE WALKED OUT OF CAMP.
268,00:11:27.38,00:11:27.38,AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS A LITTLE STRANGE.
269,00:11:29.75,00:11:29.75,WHY DID SHE JUST TAKE THE FLOUR?
270,00:11:34.21,00:11:34.21,>> I'M HIDING THE FLOUR BECAUSE THOSE TORTILLAS WERE GOOD
271,00:11:36.46,00:11:36.46,AND EVERYBODY WAS BEING STINGY AND I PUT A LOT OF MY HEART
272,00:11:39.12,00:11:39.12,AND SOUL INTO MAKING THOSE THINGS AND I MADE A BIG ONE
273,00:11:42.25,00:11:42.25,FOR ME AND THEY ALL TOOK IT.
274,00:11:43.79,00:11:43.79,THEY REALLY MADE ME MAD.
275,00:11:45.62,00:11:45.62,SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THEM MAD.
276,00:11:47.17,00:11:47.17,DON'T PLAY WITH ME IN THIS GAME.
277,00:11:49.21,00:11:49.21,I CAN PLAY DIRTY.
278,00:12:04.00,00:12:04.00,"I AM STEALING EQUIPMENT TO MAKE TORTILLAS, AND I'M TAKING FRUIT."
279,00:12:07.54,00:12:07.54,I'VE TAKEN BOWLS AND SPOONS.
280,00:12:12.08,00:12:12.08,IT TASTES BETTER WHEN YOU'RE STEALING IT.
281,00:12:14.62,00:12:14.62,IT'S LIKE A SWEET VICTORY.
282,00:12:18.00,00:12:18.00,"ALINA, EVERYBODY IS AGAINST HER RIGHT NOW."
283,00:12:21.29,00:12:21.29,"I DON'T MIND BEING THAT ONE PERSON THAT, YOU KNOW,"
284,00:12:23.83,00:12:23.83,TELLS HER A LITTLE SOMETHING-SOMETHING.
285,00:12:33.58,00:12:33.58,>> SO WHERE DO YOU STAND?
286,00:12:35.42,00:12:35.42,DO YOU STAND WITH THE SIX WE TALKED ABOUT
287,00:12:36.92,00:12:36.92,OR ARE YOU BACK WITH BRENDA?
288,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,>> I'M WITH THE SIX.
289,00:12:40.83,00:12:40.83,>> IF ANYBODY I WAS WORRIED ABOUT IS YOU.
290,00:12:42.54,00:12:42.54,>> WHY?
291,00:12:44.04,00:12:44.04,>> BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE BACK WITH BRENDA.
292,00:12:46.21,00:12:46.21,"I MEAN, YOU SPENT ALL DAY WITH HER YESTERDAY."
293,00:12:47.92,00:12:47.92,>> I WAS CATCHING UP WITH HER.
294,00:12:50.88,00:12:50.88,>> DO YOU THINK THE FIRST VOTE WILL STILL BE MARTY?
295,00:12:52.42,00:12:52.42,>> KELLY IS RIGHT THERE.
296,00:12:54.75,00:12:54.75,"I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE GUNNING FOR YOU."
297,00:12:58.29,00:12:58.29,>> WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO GET RID OF ME?
298,00:13:01.33,00:13:01.33,">> THEY'RE GUNNING FOR YOU, MAN, I DON'T KNOW."
299,00:13:07.25,00:13:07.25,>> DO THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS TO DO THAT?
300,00:13:09.12,00:13:09.12,>> THEY DON'T HAVE ME.
301,00:13:10.58,00:13:10.58,"I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE THEY GOT, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT."
302,00:13:14.08,00:13:14.08,>> EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT CLAIMED THEY WERE GOING
303,00:13:18.29,00:13:18.29,TO BE STRONG SIX TOTALLY LIED.
304,00:13:21.42,00:13:21.42,AND THERE I AM THE FOOL THAT WAS SITTING THERE LIKE I REALLY AM
305,00:13:26.17,00:13:26.17,GOING TO DO THIS TO THESE PEOPLE.
306,00:13:41.42,00:13:41.42,>> BUT YOU HAVE TO BUST YOUR ASS.
307,00:13:43.21,00:13:43.21,">> I WAS THINKING OF ANOTHER PLAN, OTHER THAN JUST WINNING."
308,00:13:52.50,00:13:52.50,I'VE GOT TO GET SOME NUMBERS.
309,00:13:54.12,00:13:54.12,>> WHO? EVERYBODY IS AGAINST YOU.
310,00:13:55.29,00:13:55.29,>> WHY IS EVERYBODY AGAINST ME?
311,00:13:56.58,00:13:56.58,>> I DON'T KNOW.
312,00:13:57.92,00:13:57.92,>> I BUSTED MY ASS SINCE DAY ONE OUT HERE.
313,00:14:01.46,00:14:01.46,>> EVERYTHING EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT YOU RIGHT NOW
314,00:14:02.83,00:14:02.83,THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALLIANCE.
315,00:14:05.12,00:14:05.12,I THINK THEY THINK THAT YOU'RE A THREAT
316,00:14:06.12,00:14:06.12,BUT YOU'RE EASY TO GET OUT.
317,00:14:09.25,00:14:09.25,>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GRABBED ALL THIS STUFF.
318,00:14:10.92,00:14:10.92,YOU'RE CRAZY.
319,00:14:12.92,00:14:12.92,>> I'M HAVING FUN. YOU GOTTA HAVE FUN.
320,00:14:14.17,00:14:14.17,>> IT'S SO GOOD.
321,00:14:19.25,00:14:19.25,>> MY REASON FOR TELLING ALINA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE
322,00:14:22.21,00:14:22.21,"THE FIRST ONE OUT, THAT'S A VOTE THAT I'LL HAVE GUARANTEED"
323,00:14:23.92,00:14:23.92,WHEN SHE'S A PART OF THE JURY.
324,00:14:26.29,00:14:26.29,SO I HAVE TO BE SMART.
325,00:14:27.58,00:14:27.58,"IF I WANT TO KEEP TALKING TO ALINA,"
326,00:14:29.00,00:14:29.00,BECAUSE I WANT HER TO FEEL SAFE WITH ME.
327,00:14:30.38,00:14:30.38,I WANT HER TO KNOW I HAVE HER BACK EVEN THOUGH
328,00:14:32.08,00:14:32.08,I KIND OF DON'T BUT I KIND OF DO AT THE SAME TIME.
329,00:14:34.58,00:14:34.58,IT'S LIKE A TOSS-UP.
330,00:14:37.08,00:14:37.08,>> DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE BIG WOODEN BOWL WENT?
331,00:14:39.54,00:14:39.54,">> LAST TIME I SAW IT, IT WAS RIGHT OVER THERE"
332,00:14:41.25,00:14:41.25,AND IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.
333,00:14:44.83,00:14:44.83,>> WHAT ABOUT THE FRYING PAN?
334,00:14:46.92,00:14:46.92,"IS THAT GONE, TOO?"
335,00:14:48.75,00:14:48.75,"FOR SURE, FOR SURE?"
336,00:14:50.21,00:14:50.21,THE BOWL AND THE FRYING PAN?
337,00:14:52.92,00:14:52.92,>> YUP.
338,00:14:55.21,00:14:55.21,">> THAT DIDN'T JUST GET SWEPT AWAY BY THE TIDE, YOU GUYS."
339,00:15:00.21,00:15:00.21,">> HEY, WHERE'S THE FLOUR?"
340,00:15:01.62,00:15:01.62,>> NO WAY!
341,00:15:03.79,00:15:03.79,THEY TOOK THE FLOUR!
342,00:15:05.08,00:15:05.08,>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
343,00:15:07.04,00:15:07.04,>> THAT'S REALLY UNCOOL.
344,00:15:14.62,00:15:14.62,">> NAONKA, DID YOU PUT THE FLOUR"
345,00:15:16.08,00:15:16.08,BACK IN THE CHEST?
346,00:15:20.71,00:15:20.71,I SAW HER TAKE IT AND PUT IT IN HER BAG.
347,00:15:22.71,00:15:22.71,">> AND I PUT IT BACK, AND I SAID I PUT IT BACK."
348,00:15:25.58,00:15:25.58,>> YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BAG?
349,00:15:26.79,00:15:26.79,>> AND I PUT IT BACK.
350,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,I DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT IN MY BAG.
351,00:15:29.92,00:15:29.92,>> WHY DID IT GO IN THE BAG?
352,00:15:31.50,00:15:31.50,>> I WAS GOING TO PUT HALF IN THERE.
353,00:15:32.79,00:15:32.79,>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYBODY IS WONDERING
354,00:15:34.25,00:15:34.25,WHY YOU PUT IT IN YOUR BACK?
355,00:15:36.38,00:15:36.38,">> I DIDN'T TAKE IT, UNCLE DAN, I DIDN'T TAKE IT."
356,00:15:38.67,00:15:38.67,"FABIO, I DIDN'T TAKE IT."
357,00:15:39.71,00:15:39.71,SASH I DIDN'T TAKE IT.
358,00:15:41.04,00:15:41.04,"I'M DONE, FABIO."
359,00:15:43.00,00:15:43.00,I ALREADY SAID WHAT I'M GOING TO SAID.
360,00:15:44.54,00:15:44.54,>> I DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAD TO GO IN YOUR BAG.
361,00:15:46.67,00:15:46.67,>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
362,00:15:49.71,00:15:49.71,">> JUST SO YOU KNOW, NOBODY ON THE TRIBE UNDERSTANDS"
363,00:15:52.29,00:15:52.29,WHY IT HAD TO GO IN YOUR BAG.
364,00:15:53.67,00:15:53.67,>> I PUT IT BACK.
365,00:15:55.17,00:15:55.17,>> WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU IF YOU PUT IT BACK OR NOT!
366,00:15:58.79,00:15:58.79,WE'RE NOT--
367,00:16:00.67,00:16:00.67,WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU WHETHER YOU PUT IT...
368,00:16:06.50,00:16:06.50,>> IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!
369,00:16:10.79,00:16:10.79,">> OH, MY GOD."
370,00:16:11.96,00:16:11.96,IT WAS SO HARD TO SIT THERE.
371,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS FREE OF GUILT.
372,00:16:15.75,00:16:15.75,"OBVIOUSLY, I'M TOTALLY CONNECTED WITH THE FACT THAT SHE DID THAT."
373,00:16:20.04,00:16:20.04,"BECAUSE I KNEW ABOUT IT, AND I DIDN'T STOP HER"
374,00:16:21.88,00:16:21.88,AND I DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT IT.
375,00:16:23.25,00:16:23.25,"THE REASON IT WAS SO HARD FOR ME TO OWN UP TO IT,"
376,00:16:26.08,00:16:26.08,EVERYBODY MIGHT BE EQUALLY AS PISSED OFF AS ME
377,00:16:28.29,00:16:28.29,AS THEY ARE AT NAONKA.
378,00:16:30.46,00:16:30.46,>> ARE YOU PUTTING MY NAME OUT THERE?
379,00:16:32.42,00:16:32.42,>> NO. IT NEEDS TO COME OUT.
380,00:16:34.75,00:16:34.75,EVERYTHING NEEDS TO COME OUT.
381,00:16:35.88,00:16:35.88,WHAT HAPPENED?
382,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,"WHAT THIS TRIBE NEEDS RIGHT NOW, IS THIS COMES OUT."
383,00:16:41.17,00:16:41.17,>> FOR EVERYTHING TO JUST COME BACK HERE.
384,00:16:43.79,00:16:43.79,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYBODY HAS TO PUT NAMES.
385,00:16:45.54,00:16:45.54,WHAT DO YOU WANT A NAME?
386,00:16:47.50,00:16:47.50,">> THAT'S THE THING, A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW KNOW IT WAS YOU."
387,00:16:52.00,00:16:52.00,YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY IT.
388,00:16:53.17,00:16:53.17,>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
389,00:16:54.38,00:16:54.38,IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS JUST 'FESS UP.
390,00:16:56.21,00:16:56.21,EVERYBODY WILL APPRECIATE IT AND RESPECT YOU SO MUCH MORE.
391,00:17:00.21,00:17:00.21,>> I TOLD EVERYBODY INDIVIDUALLY I DID NOT TAKE IT.
392,00:17:02.75,00:17:02.75,>> YOU LIED.
393,00:17:04.21,00:17:04.21,"YOU LIED IN ""SURVIVOR?"""
394,00:17:06.04,00:17:06.04,>> EVERYONE WILL GET THAT.
395,00:17:07.46,00:17:07.46,">> EVERYONE'S LIED IN ""SURVIVOR."""

406,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,FOR YOUR ADVANTAGE AND SHARE IT.

416,00:17:59.21,00:17:59.21,IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS HER IDEA.
417,00:18:00.75,00:18:00.75,IT WASN'T.

426,00:18:19.00,00:18:19.00,CAN BE VALUABLE TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
427,00:18:20.46,00:18:20.46,SHE LIED AND SHE STOLE.
428,00:18:21.96,00:18:21.96,HOW EASY IS THAT? GET RID OF HER.
429,00:18:23.58,00:18:23.58,IT SHOULD BE THAT SIMPLE BUT THIS GAME IS NEVER SIMPLE.

439,00:19:29.50,00:19:29.50,AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT WORKS PERFECTLY INTO MY GAME PLAN AS
440,00:19:32.33,00:19:32.33,HAVING HER AS ONE OF THE FINAL THREE BECAUSE THAT PRETTY MUCH
441,00:19:36.67,00:19:36.67,GUARANTEES HER THAT SHE'S NOT GOING TO RECEIVE
442,00:19:38.88,00:19:38.88,ANY MILLION-DOLLAR VOTES.
443,00:19:43.17,00:19:43.17,>> I REASSURED ALL THE GUYS THAT ALINA NEEDS

449,00:20:03.21,00:20:03.21,WE'LL PICK ONE OF THEM.

463,00:20:43.17,00:20:43.17,I THINK THEY ALL SEE THE CONNECTION SHE MADE WITH CHASE.

595,00:27:56.25,00:27:56.25,>> I'M DOWN TO VOTE WHOEVER: MARTY OR ALINA OUT.
596,00:27:58.25,00:27:58.25,"I'M GONNA VOTER EITHER ONE, WHICHEVER ONE EVERYONE DECIDES."
597,00:28:02.29,00:28:02.29,"IT'S JUST, WE HAVE TO GET HER OUT SECOND."
598,00:28:04.38,00:28:04.38,">> YEAH, WE WILL. I THINK SHE'S A BIGGER THREAT."

605,00:28:26.17,00:28:26.17,>> THAT'S SEVEN RIGHT THERE.
606,00:28:27.21,00:28:27.21,>> THAT'S SEVEN.

608,00:28:30.79,00:28:30.79,"TO ALL OF THEM, BECAUSE AS FAR AS SASH GOES, IT'S ALINA."
609,00:28:33.75,00:28:33.75,>> MAKE SURE.
610,00:28:35.62,00:28:35.62,">> WELL, EVERYBODY WAS DEBATING ABOUT MARTY AND ALINA,"
611,00:28:38.58,00:28:38.58,"BUT JANE REALLY, REALLY WANTS MARTY OUT, LIKE, EVEN IF WE WERE"
612,00:28:41.67,00:28:41.67,"TO JUST ALL WRITE DOWN ALINA,"
613,00:28:43.17,00:28:43.17,SHE WILL BE THE ONE TO WRITE DOWN MARTY.
614,00:28:48.21,00:28:48.21,">> SEE, IT'S BETWEEN MARTY OR ALINA."
615,00:28:50.21,00:28:50.21,"I'LL JUST GO WITH THE MAJORITY, MAN."
616,00:28:56.29,00:28:56.29,>> I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
617,00:28:59.75,00:28:59.75,">> UM, I HAVE TO ASK YOU GUYS A BIG FAVOR."
618,00:29:02.71,00:29:02.71,"YOU KNOW, BACK IN THE FORUM,"
619,00:29:07.29,00:29:07.29,"I PROMISED MARTY THAT IF WE GO TO NEXT TRIBAL,"
620,00:29:09.54,00:29:09.54,"AND IF HE'S ON THE OUTS, THAT I WOULD GIVE HIM THE IDOL."
621,00:29:13.08,00:29:13.08,THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE WOULD GIVE IT TO ME.
622,00:29:15.58,00:29:15.58,SO ALL I'M ASKING IS TO WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ROUND.
623,00:29:18.25,00:29:18.25,"IF YOU REALLY WANT MARTY OUT, IT'S FINE."
624,00:29:20.25,00:29:20.25,BUT JUST DON'T MAKE ME GO BACK ON MY WORD TONIGHT.
625,00:29:23.00,00:29:23.00,>> THEN WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NEXT ROUND?
626,00:29:24.83,00:29:24.83,">> NO, IT'S ONLY FOR ONE TRIBAL COUNCIL."
627,00:29:27.29,00:29:27.29,">> WELL, WHAT IF HE WINS IMMUNITY THE NEXT TIME?"
628,00:29:30.00,00:29:30.00,">> NO, IT'S ONLY TONIGHT."
629,00:29:31.42,00:29:31.42,'CAUSE I ONLY PROMISED HIM THE NEXT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
630,00:29:34.25,00:29:34.25,"I GAVE HIM MY WORD, AND I DON'T WANT TO,"
631,00:29:36.79,00:29:36.79,I DON'T WANT TO START TO BREAK PROMISES RIGHT AWAY.
632,00:29:39.33,00:29:39.33,">> WELL, GIVE ME THE IDOL."
633,00:29:40.75,00:29:40.75,"I'LL HOLD IT, AND YOU DON'T HAVE IT NO MORE."
634,00:29:43.17,00:29:43.17,>> BUT I THOUGHT THE PLAN FROM THE BEGINNING...
635,00:29:45.00,00:29:45.00,>> THERE'S REALLY NO RUSH TO TAKE OUT MARTY.

637,00:29:48.58,00:29:48.58,THE NEXT THREE TIMES?
638,00:29:50.29,00:29:50.29,>> WHAT ABOUT THE IMMUNITY?
639,00:29:51.71,00:29:51.71,"WE HAVE EIGHT MORE TIMES TO GO, YOU KNOW?"
640,00:29:55.00,00:29:55.00,>> HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO IT?
641,00:29:57.58,00:29:57.58,">> WELL, FOR THE LONGEST TIME IT'S BEEN ALINA."
642,00:29:59.67,00:29:59.67,IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.
643,00:30:01.08,00:30:01.08,"I MEAN, LIKE I TOLD YOU ALL THE TIME, JUST DON'T WORRY."
644,00:30:04.04,00:30:04.04,THERE'S NO NEED TO.
645,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,>> I AM HIS TARGET.
646,00:30:07.00,00:30:07.00,">> RIGHT, BUT WE'RE YOUR ALLIANCE."
647,00:30:09.79,00:30:09.79,">> OKAY. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT MARTY OUT,"
648,00:30:12.21,00:30:12.21,BUT IT ALL GOES BACK TO SASH MAKING SOME AGREEMENT WITH MARTY
649,00:30:14.88,00:30:14.88,WHEN HE GOT HIM TO GIVE THE IDOL TO HIM WHEN HE WAS ON
650,00:30:18.25,00:30:18.25,"THE LA FLOR TRIBE SO HE COULD ""GAIN TRUST."""
651,00:30:22.12,00:30:22.12,MARTY'S ALWAYS A THREAT.
652,00:30:23.17,00:30:23.17,"MARTY, TO ME, IS THE BIGGEST THREAT,"
653,00:30:25.08,00:30:25.08,"SO I'M NOT VOTING FOR ALINA, I'M NOT."
654,00:30:29.08,00:30:29.08,'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL RIGHT ABOUT VOTING SOMEBODY OUT
655,00:30:31.88,00:30:31.88,THAT I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE LEAVING RIGHT NOW.
656,00:30:45.71,00:30:45.71,>> ME?
657,00:30:46.33,00:30:46.33,>> YEAH.
658,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,>> BUT THAT'S JUST YOUR GUT.
659,00:30:58.21,00:30:58.21,">> NO, IT'S-IT'S NOT A BLINDSIDE."
660,00:31:00.33,00:31:00.33,>> THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD DAN.
661,00:31:01.79,00:31:01.79,>> WHAT?
662,00:31:03.17,00:31:03.17,">> THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD DAN, I'M BEING SET UP FOR A BLINDSIDE."

665,00:31:14.92,00:31:14.92,BECAUSE YOU DON'T GO TELL SOMEONE
666,00:31:16.29,00:31:16.29,YOU'RE GONNA BLINDSIDE SOMEBODY
667,00:31:17.67,00:31:17.67,IF YOU HAVE AT LEAST FOUR OR FIVE VOTES BEHIND YOU.
668,00:31:21.04,00:31:21.04,"I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN BROACH THE SUBJECT."
669,00:31:23.29,00:31:23.29,>> CHASE WENT UP TO DANNY
670,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,AND SAID WE'RE GONNA BLINDSIDE MARTY TONIGHT.
671,00:31:26.96,00:31:26.96,>> IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TRYING TO TURN ON-ON OUR-OUR GUYS.
672,00:31:29.29,00:31:29.29,>> YOU GUYS BLINDSIDE MARTY TONIGHT?
673,00:31:30.79,00:31:30.79,>> THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD DANNY.

675,00:31:34.25,00:31:34.25,>> I JUST NEVER HEAR IT FROM YOU.
676,00:31:35.62,00:31:35.62,"I MEAN, I GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION I CAN."
677,00:31:37.58,00:31:37.58,I'M NOT A PLAYER IN THIS GAME. I DON'T HAVE POWER.
678,00:31:40.17,00:31:40.17,I DON'T HAVE NUMBERS. I DON'T HAVE AN IDOL ANYMORE.
679,00:31:42.17,00:31:42.17,I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.
680,00:31:43.83,00:31:43.83,"THAT'S IT. I'M A ZERO THREAT, SO TO PEOPLE TO EVEN SPEND"
681,00:31:46.62,00:31:46.62,AN OUNCE OF ENERGY THINKING ABOUT VOTING MARTY OFF IS CRAZY.
682,00:31:49.17,00:31:49.17,">> MARTY'S BEEN COMING UP TO ME CONSTANTLY TODAY,"
683,00:31:51.04,00:31:51.04,ALMOST TOO MUCH.
684,00:31:52.25,00:31:52.25,"I THINK HE BELIEVES THAT HE'S ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK,"
685,00:31:54.79,00:31:54.79,"WHICH ONLY BY BEING MORE AND MORE PARANOID ON HIS PART,"
686,00:31:58.21,00:31:58.21,IS HE REALLY PLACING A BIGGER TARGET ON HIS BACK.
687,00:32:00.67,00:32:00.67,"I THINK HIS BEST MOVE WOULD BE TO LAY LOW,"
688,00:32:03.58,00:32:03.58,"BUT THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE,"
689,00:32:06.33,00:32:06.33,AND HE'S ACTUALLY DIGGING HIS OWN GRAVE AT THE MOMENT.
690,00:32:09.38,00:32:09.38,">> EVERYONE SAYS THEY'RE VOTING FOR ALINA,"
691,00:32:11.04,00:32:11.04,BUT THERE'S OTHER STUFF GOING ON
692,00:32:12.29,00:32:12.29,THAT I THINK VOTES WILL BE CAST AGAINST ME
693,00:32:14.29,00:32:14.29,AND PEOPLE WILL TRY TO GET ME.
694,00:32:15.96,00:32:15.96,">> NO, THEY ARE. THEY'RE VOTING FOR ALINA."

714,00:33:00.83,00:33:00.83,THAT'S SIX. IF WE CAN GET ONE MORE.
715,00:33:03.00,00:33:03.00,IF WE COULD GET FABIO.

719,00:33:16.17,00:33:16.17,AND WE NEED ONE MORE AND THAT WILL BE SEVEN.
720,00:33:18.17,00:33:18.17,"OBVIOUSLY, EVERYONE WANTS MARTY GONE, IT'S JUST--"
721,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,IS IT GOING TO BE ME OR HIM FIRST?
722,00:33:23.25,00:33:23.25,AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE HIM FIRST.
