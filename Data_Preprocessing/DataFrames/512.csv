2,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST: Previously  on Survivor... Brian won
3,00:00:04.37,00:00:04.37, the reward challenge and chose  to take Clay with him
4,00:00:07.37,00:00:07.37," o the mainland,  for an elephant trek."
5,00:00:09.07,00:00:09.07,"BRIAN: We're more than halfway   through the game, and this is"
6,00:00:11.33,00:00:11.33," an excellent time for us  to just clear our heads,"
7,00:00:12.90,00:00:12.90,get away from everyone.
8,00:00:14.80,00:00:14.80,"TED: I kind of knew there was  a bond between Clay and Brian,"
9,00:00:18.10,00:00:18.10,but the fact that he did select Clay kind of just told me
10,00:00:20.43,00:00:20.43,that that bond is closer than what I thought it was.
11,00:00:22.47,00:00:22.47,"PROBST:  Back at camp,"
12,00:00:24.10,00:00:24.10, Jake was trying hard  to stay in the game.
13,00:00:27.17,00:00:27.17, He tried to convince Helen  to turn on Brian or Clay.
14,00:00:30.47,00:00:30.47,"JAKE: Course, if she  got rid of Brian and Clay,"
15,00:00:32.73,00:00:32.73,I think I'd be back in the hunt.
16,00:00:34.47,00:00:34.47,PROBST: Penny was also fighting to stay on the island.
17,00:00:37.47,00:00:37.47, She severed her ties  with former ally Jake
18,00:00:40.30,00:00:40.30, when she helped eliminate him  from the immunity challenge.
19,00:00:42.40,00:00:42.40,PENNY: I was trying to send  a message to Chuay Gahn that
20,00:00:46.53,00:00:46.53,Jake and I don't really have an alliance anymore.
21,00:00:49.10,00:00:49.10,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,  Jake spoke out in desperation."
22,00:00:52.83,00:00:52.83,"At last Tribal Council,"
23,00:00:54.27,00:00:54.27,I heard from this tribe that they vote people off
24,00:00:57.33,00:00:57.33,based on how a person really performs.
25,00:00:59.83,00:00:59.83,"I think my performance stands up to everybody's on the tribe,"
26,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63,and I'll be kind of curious tonight if that still holds up.
27,00:01:06.87,00:01:06.87,"PROBST: When the votes came in,  Penny took the fall."
28,00:01:09.40,00:01:09.40,"Penny, the tribe has spoken."
29,00:01:12.67,00:01:12.67, Six are left.
30,00:01:14.03,00:01:14.03," Tonight, one more will go."
31,00:02:30.03,00:02:30.03,"JAN:  During Tribal Council,"
32,00:02:32.40,00:02:32.40," Jake said, ""I feel like  I'm one of the hardest workers"
33,00:02:34.90,00:02:34.90," ""out here; a lot harder worker"
34,00:02:36.90,00:02:36.90," than some of the others  in the tribe."""
35,00:02:39.40,00:02:39.40,And Clay doesn't really simmer with things like that real well.
36,00:02:43.67,00:02:43.67,How'd you like that statement
37,00:02:45.07,00:02:45.07,up there at that Council meeting?
38,00:02:46.30,00:02:46.30,But we know where number day three lays.
39,00:02:50.10,00:02:50.10,"JACK: What they said  last Tribal Council was,"
40,00:02:52.93,00:02:52.93,anybody that did not produce was the one who was going.
41,00:02:55.73,00:02:55.73,"And I gotta tell you, I'll put my production up,"
42,00:02:58.53,00:02:58.53," basically, against anybody's."
43,00:03:00.57,00:03:00.57, And that offended Clay.
44,00:03:02.10,00:03:02.10,CLAY: I think everybody in this camp works just as hard as you.
45,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,"JAKE: No, I didn't say I worked any harder. I just said that--"
46,00:03:06.53,00:03:06.53,"CLAY: Well, somebody's got to get their ass kicked off."
47,00:03:08.23,00:03:08.23,"HELEN: Quite frankly,  I don't think Clay"
48,00:03:10.27,00:03:10.27," liked that playing  at Tribal Council,"
49,00:03:13.00,00:03:13.00,because it was true.
50,00:03:15.00,00:03:15.00,Jake does more than Clay.
51,00:03:16.57,00:03:16.57,Why do you think Clay got upset?
52,00:03:18.70,00:03:18.70, People working  know they're working.
53,00:03:20.17,00:03:20.17, The people skating
54,00:03:21.80,00:03:21.80,know they're skating.
55,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,And he was ticked
56,00:03:23.90,00:03:23.90, that Jake brought that up.
57,00:03:25.40,00:03:25.40,CLAY: We thought you were a bigger person--
58,00:03:27.67,00:03:27.67,that we'd think you'd just stand up and slap all five
59,00:03:30.10,00:03:30.10,of us right square in the face.
60,00:03:31.63,00:03:31.63,-I didn't slap anybody. -You slapped all five of us
61,00:03:33.60,00:03:33.60,right square in the face-- the hell you didn't.
62,00:03:35.57,00:03:35.57,"No, what I said was, see, at the last Tribal Council..."
63,00:03:38.17,00:03:38.17,I'm gonna test y'all to see if y'all are sayin'
64,00:03:40.60,00:03:40.60,what y'all are doing-- that the people that work
65,00:03:42.07,00:03:42.07,get to stay on the tribe.
66,00:03:43.97,00:03:43.97,TED: Clay is definitely starting  to get on my nerves.
67,00:03:45.77,00:03:45.77,"The outburst that he had, I thought,"
68,00:03:48.00,00:03:48.00,"was very, very childish and uncalled for."
69,00:03:50.90,00:03:50.90, I didn't see anything wrong  with Jake's comment.
70,00:03:54.80,00:03:54.80, It was just words.
71,00:03:56.03,00:03:56.03, So what if he felt that way?
72,00:03:58.03,00:03:58.03,Who gives a heck?
73,00:03:59.70,00:03:59.70,Are you proud of me?
74,00:04:01.53,00:04:01.53,"That was messed up, what you did."
75,00:04:04.23,00:04:04.23,(Clay chuckles)
76,00:04:05.93,00:04:05.93,CLAY: It had to be said.
77,00:04:08.70,00:04:08.70,Just had to.
78,00:04:11.93,00:04:11.93,I just had to.
79,00:04:44.00,00:04:44.00,31 days.
80,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,"Overall, we're physically whupped."
81,00:04:49.10,00:04:49.10,"You take 31 days in a cave, living off"
82,00:04:52.30,00:04:52.30, whatever you can find.
83,00:04:53.60,00:04:53.60," I've lost way,  way too much weight."
84,00:04:55.20,00:04:55.20," I miss my family,"
85,00:04:56.47,00:04:56.47," I miss home, and we're  to the point now"
86,00:04:58.37,00:04:58.37, where you can start  smelling it.
87,00:04:59.93,00:04:59.93," You know it's coming,  it's not long."
88,00:05:06.30,00:05:06.30, JAKE: Every day I spend  a little bit of time
89,00:05:09.77,00:05:09.77, just kind of jotting down
90,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,what I've been doing here.
91,00:05:13.20,00:05:13.20,"You know, it's kind of like a letter to my wife."
92,00:05:15.07,00:05:15.07,"In fact, it is a letter to my wife--"
93,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77," a little journal of what's  happening through the day,"
94,00:05:20.27,00:05:20.27," and with a lot  of ""I miss you"" kind of stuff"
95,00:05:24.07,00:05:24.07, rolled into it.
96,00:05:25.37,00:05:25.37," I can see  the ending's in sight and, uh,"
97,00:05:30.40,00:05:30.40,I just sit here waiting on the next challenge.
98,00:05:42.97,00:05:42.97,"Oh, boy, mail delivery."
99,00:05:44.10,00:05:44.10,-Mail call! -JAN: Mail!
100,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,Mail call!
101,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,Oh! It's beautiful.
102,00:05:48.90,00:05:48.90,We get a sneak peek.
103,00:05:49.97,00:05:49.97,-(Jan gasps) -We get to sneak peak.
104,00:05:51.53,00:05:51.53,-Oh-oh-oh-oh! -We're gonna eat.
105,00:05:52.60,00:05:52.60,We're gonna eat. We're gonna eat.
106,00:05:53.87,00:05:53.87, Helen and I went down  and got treemail.
107,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,It was in a real neat little container.
108,00:05:57.60,00:05:57.60,"We opened it up and there was rice-- oh, God!--"
109,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,so we were so excited.
110,00:06:00.80,00:06:00.80,We're eating! We're eating!
111,00:06:03.37,00:06:03.37,"JAN: Hey, guys!"
112,00:06:05.07,00:06:05.07,Here they come.
113,00:06:05.93,00:06:05.93,They are running.
114,00:06:07.93,00:06:07.93,"JAKE: Oh, my gosh, the girls came sprinting back up there."
115,00:06:10.87,00:06:10.87,"Now these are people who can hardly walk,"
116,00:06:12.83,00:06:12.83,and they sprinted up here.
117,00:06:14.07,00:06:14.07,What? What?
118,00:06:15.20,00:06:15.20,TED: You're running. What? What?
119,00:06:17.07,00:06:17.07,"""Good food is luxury. You need nourishment at least,"
120,00:06:20.23,00:06:20.23,"""so gather your appetite for it's time to feast."
121,00:06:23.43,00:06:23.43,"""This one will give you a smile, maybe a tear to your eye."
122,00:06:26.67,00:06:26.67,"What an experience, so at least give it a try."""
123,00:06:29.47,00:06:29.47,"Look-- look, look, look."
124,00:06:30.47,00:06:30.47,"TED:  We saw the word ""feast,"
125,00:06:32.03,00:06:32.03,"luxury, nourishment,""-- so, automatically, food was"
126,00:06:35.90,00:06:35.90,"like, oh, this is great."
127,00:06:37.57,00:06:37.57,"-CLAY: Oh...! -JAKE: Oh, My God!"
128,00:06:39.83,00:06:39.83,TED: What does this mean? What does this mean?
129,00:06:41.63,00:06:41.63,-There's a feast? -HELEN: Somebody's eating.
130,00:06:43.23,00:06:43.23,JAN: Somebody's gonna eat. Somebody.
131,00:06:51.63,00:06:51.63,PROBST: You guys ready? All right.
132,00:06:52.90,00:06:52.90,"CLAY: Yes, sir."
133,00:06:54.30,00:06:54.30,"Okay, guys, today we're gonna show you the reward"
134,00:06:57.47,00:06:57.47,before we show you the challenge.
135,00:06:59.23,00:06:59.23,Okay.
136,00:07:00.37,00:07:00.37,This is what you're playing for.
137,00:07:03.17,00:07:03.17,"Helen, here's your husband Jim."
138,00:07:06.33,00:07:06.33,"Oh, my God!"
139,00:07:07.23,00:07:07.23,PROBST: Stay seated.
140,00:07:08.90,00:07:08.90,"Guys, you're gonna have to stay seated."
141,00:07:13.90,00:07:13.90,(laughing)
142,00:07:18.37,00:07:18.37,"Ted, say hey to your brother Alwan."
143,00:07:20.30,00:07:20.30,(both shout happily)
144,00:07:25.03,00:07:25.03,"-ALWAN: What's up, bro? -Yeah!"
145,00:07:30.63,00:07:30.63,-That's my brother right there. -He's skinny! -Who's that?
146,00:07:32.83,00:07:32.83,"PROBST: Brian, say hello to your wife CeCe."
147,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,"Oh, my God."
148,00:07:36.10,00:07:36.10,"Hey, baby!"
149,00:07:42.87,00:07:42.87,"-CLAY: Hey, CeCe. -CECE: Oh, my God!"
150,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,"PROBST: Jake, here's your wife Jenny."
151,00:07:50.57,00:07:50.57,"There's your soul mate, Jake."
152,00:07:58.77,00:07:58.77,That looks like Lady Luck.
153,00:08:00.07,00:08:00.07,"Clay, your wife Linda."
154,00:08:02.80,00:08:02.80,"CLAY: Hey, baby!"
155,00:08:04.43,00:08:04.43,I got my buff!
156,00:08:06.33,00:08:06.33,(quietly): I love you.
157,00:08:07.80,00:08:07.80,"I love you, too."
158,00:08:09.27,00:08:09.27,"Jan, you know we're not gonna leave you out of this."
159,00:08:11.93,00:08:11.93,Here's your son Jeff.
160,00:08:14.30,00:08:14.30,"All right, baby boy!"
161,00:08:19.47,00:08:19.47,He found it!
162,00:08:22.00,00:08:22.00,(Jan laughing)
163,00:08:26.90,00:08:26.90,"Well, guys, you been out here 31 days,"
164,00:08:30.17,00:08:30.17,and I have no doubt
165,00:08:31.80,00:08:31.80,that the faces of your loved ones look
166,00:08:34.37,00:08:34.37,more beautiful right now than they ever have before.
167,00:08:39.17,00:08:39.17,"For the winner of today's challenge,"
168,00:08:40.80,00:08:40.80,your loved one will get to spend 24 hours out here with you.
169,00:08:43.53,00:08:43.53,They will get one full day
170,00:08:45.87,00:08:45.87,of the life that you guys are going through.
171,00:08:48.23,00:08:48.23,"They will eat with you, they'll sleep with you,"
172,00:08:50.10,00:08:50.10,"they'll look for water,"
173,00:08:51.30,00:08:51.30,they'll do everything you're doing.
174,00:08:52.43,00:08:52.43,"For the losers, nothing."
175,00:08:55.33,00:08:55.33,Hear me clearly.
176,00:08:57.13,00:08:57.13,Not a kiss...
177,00:08:58.43,00:08:58.43,Oh!
178,00:08:59.33,00:08:59.33,"...not a hug, not a handshake."
179,00:09:02.13,00:09:02.13,You guys have been out here over a month.
180,00:09:05.67,00:09:05.67,"And so far, you've been able to find enough coconuts and clams"
181,00:09:09.07,00:09:09.07,"-Chicken feed. -...and edible plants,"
182,00:09:10.63,00:09:10.63,that you've been able to avoid having to live off the bugs
183,00:09:13.57,00:09:13.57,and the insects that are out here.
184,00:09:15.43,00:09:15.43,"But what I'm curious about is, would you eat those bugs"
185,00:09:18.70,00:09:18.70,and those insects if it meant getting to spend
186,00:09:21.57,00:09:21.57,one full day with your loved one?
187,00:09:24.00,00:09:24.00,JAN: Absolutely.
188,00:09:25.40,00:09:25.40,"Pick the son of a bitch up, I'll eat it."
189,00:09:27.03,00:09:27.03,I'm ready.
190,00:09:28.33,00:09:28.33,I'd eat whatever I needed to eat
191,00:09:30.27,00:09:30.27,to be with my baby boy.
192,00:09:33.57,00:09:33.57,And you know what? I believe you guys.
193,00:09:35.90,00:09:35.90,I believe all of you would do just about anything
194,00:09:38.73,00:09:38.73,to win this reward.
195,00:09:40.07,00:09:40.07,But that's not the question.
196,00:09:42.17,00:09:42.17,The question is...
197,00:09:43.57,00:09:43.57,would they?
198,00:09:44.53,00:09:44.53,"-Oh, no. -Oh, no!"
199,00:09:48.37,00:09:48.37,(mouthing): Eat! Eat!
200,00:09:49.80,00:09:49.80,PROBST: Are they willing
201,00:09:50.83,00:09:50.83,to eat bugs and insects to be with you?
202,00:09:53.27,00:09:53.27,'Cause that's the challenge.

489,00:20:40.70,00:20:40.70, so I could   spend 24 hours with Helen.
490,00:20:41.93,00:20:41.93,-These are our torches. -Uh-huh.

492,00:20:46.23,00:20:46.23,I told him it was a girly necklace; it needed to be on me.

547,00:23:09.83,00:23:09.83,HELEN: I think I've been on every single water run there was
548,00:23:12.93,00:23:12.93,except maybe one or two.

550,00:23:20.20,00:23:20.20, I decided to take Jim on the  canoe ride today to show him

552,00:23:25.20,00:23:25.20,so that he could get the full experience

554,00:23:30.23,00:23:30.23,"JIM: You got a comb with you, right?"
555,00:23:34.50,00:23:34.50,It takes about ten.

558,00:23:41.77,00:23:41.77, I'm a little surprised at  how well Helen was able

562,00:23:49.07,00:23:49.07,(Helen sighs)
563,00:23:51.80,00:23:51.80, She's adapted wonderfully.
564,00:23:53.27,00:23:53.27,I haven't heard her complaining  about anything.

566,00:23:57.60,00:23:57.60," She does what she has to do  to survive, to get along."
567,00:24:00.70,00:24:00.70,Oh!
568,00:24:02.33,00:24:02.33,(chuckles)
569,00:24:03.63,00:24:03.63,Nobody will know about this.
570,00:24:05.70,00:24:05.70,"She's gonna do what it, what it takes to win the game."
571,00:24:08.27,00:24:08.27,She didn't come here to come in third.
572,00:24:11.97,00:24:11.97,You see what I'm up against.
573,00:24:13.90,00:24:13.90,"See, Brian'll play fair and with integrity, Clay won't."
574,00:24:17.53,00:24:17.53,"Clay's out for Clay, he's a selfish son of a gun"
575,00:24:20.13,00:24:20.13,"and he'll cut everybody's throat here,"
576,00:24:21.80,00:24:21.80,if he thinks it'll get him the million.
577,00:24:23.80,00:24:23.80,I trust Brian.
578,00:24:25.07,00:24:25.07,Brian's an up-front guy.
579,00:24:26.20,00:24:26.20,I don't trust Clay.
580,00:24:28.13,00:24:28.13," What I'm trying to figure out  is can I flip Jan,"

583,00:24:33.63,00:24:33.63,But I've seen the way the people react to you.
584,00:24:35.90,00:24:35.90,You really don't-- maybe you don't need Brian.
585,00:24:37.70,00:24:37.70,Get rid of the person that's the biggest threat.
586,00:24:40.00,00:24:40.00,I just wouldn't feel right doing that.
587,00:24:42.33,00:24:42.33, I-I thought she would do  anything
588,00:24:43.77,00:24:43.77," for the million dollars,"
589,00:24:45.13,00:24:45.13,"and she said, ""I also want to do what's right."""
590,00:24:47.40,00:24:47.40,And I was a little surprised by that.
591,00:24:49.13,00:24:49.13," Morally, I know I would not be this far"
592,00:24:53.10,00:24:53.10,if it hadn't been for Brian.
593,00:24:55.00,00:24:55.00,So could I begrudge him a million? No.
594,00:24:58.33,00:24:58.33,"And he told me, he goes, ""Hey, H., I'm taking you with me."
595,00:25:01.53,00:25:01.53,"I'm taking you along."""
596,00:25:02.77,00:25:02.77,"And when he told me that, I was, like, ""Whoa."""
597,00:25:05.90,00:25:05.90,"You're doing it right so far, so I'm not gonna..."
598,00:25:08.47,00:25:08.47,"Whatever you're doing, you're doing it right."
599,00:25:10.70,00:25:10.70, Just in being able to talk  about the game
600,00:25:13.80,00:25:13.80," and strategize with Jim,"
601,00:25:15.10,00:25:15.10,"I'm gonna dread seeing him go,"
602,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,"but I've been so recharged on this,"
603,00:25:19.43,00:25:19.43,"that, um... I'm-I'm gonna be fine."
604,00:25:22.33,00:25:22.33,"(low, indistinct conversation)"
605,00:25:27.37,00:25:27.37,"I'll look for something like this and, oh, there's a clam"
606,00:25:32.27,00:25:32.27,or what they're calling clams.
607,00:25:34.10,00:25:34.10,"-JIM: Let me see. -BRIAN: Yeah, there you go."
608,00:25:48.63,00:25:48.63,HELEN: That's his?
609,00:25:50.13,00:25:50.13, Spending the day with Jim was  the huge

817,00:35:08.57,00:35:08.57,"Thanks, man. Thanks, Jake."
818,00:35:09.97,00:35:09.97,"-Congratulations on winning that. -Appreciate that, man."
819,00:35:12.13,00:35:12.13,JAKE:  And it makes you realize
820,00:35:14.80,00:35:14.80, how special it really is
821,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50, to be able to experience
822,00:35:21.37,00:35:21.37,33 days in a cave and on a beach...
823,00:35:25.73,00:35:25.73,without your loved one and then to be able to see them.
824,00:35:28.60,00:35:28.60, And how it makes you feel.
825,00:35:47.70,00:35:47.70,Next plan of attack.
826,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77,I'll be back in a minute.
827,00:35:50.13,00:35:50.13,"-Oh, you got to go? -Yeah."
828,00:35:51.93,00:35:51.93,HELEN:  I have to get Brian aside
829,00:35:54.40,00:35:54.40, and run some strategy by him
830,00:35:56.67,00:35:56.67,and just get some opinion work done there.
831,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,I don't trust Clay.
832,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,"I don't, I'm sorry."
833,00:36:02.87,00:36:02.87,"Do you feel that he has earned,"
834,00:36:05.97,00:36:05.97,"through merit, a number one or two spot?"
835,00:36:08.77,00:36:08.77, I trust Brian.
836,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,I don't think Brian would ever look at me
837,00:36:11.73,00:36:11.73,"and try to dupe me on something,"
838,00:36:13.53,00:36:13.53, play me for a fool.
839,00:36:14.57,00:36:14.57, And I wouldn't do that to him.
840,00:36:15.90,00:36:15.90,I hear you.
841,00:36:17.03,00:36:17.03,"Um, what you're saying."
842,00:36:18.97,00:36:18.97,"And I'm, uh, I'm considering that as well."
843,00:36:21.40,00:36:21.40,HELEN:  But I talked about perhaps
844,00:36:23.73,00:36:23.73,pulling in Ted and Jan and trying to form
845,00:36:25.83,00:36:25.83, a threesome and take out Clay.
846,00:36:27.77,00:36:27.77,I don't want him in that spot.
847,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,-So... -Okay.
848,00:36:30.40,00:36:30.40,"Let me, um-- I gotta dwell on that."
849,00:36:32.27,00:36:32.27,-We worked the whole time. -I know. I know.
850,00:36:34.60,00:36:34.60,There wasn't a job we didn't do.
851,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17," Quite frankly,  Clay does squat at camp."
852,00:36:39.87,00:36:39.87,He has gone on one
853,00:36:43.07,00:36:43.07," water run in 32 days, and he  swamped the boat when he went."
854,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,That stuff goes right up my... (mumbles)
855,00:36:49.93,00:36:49.93,...and hell no!
856,00:36:51.63,00:36:51.63,"BRIAN: So... I was, like, I'm not sure about Clay."
857,00:36:56.20,00:36:56.20,This is where practical logical business sense comes into mind
858,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,and you've got to have-- keep your mind open
859,00:37:02.33,00:37:02.33,and then adapt accordingly.
860,00:37:03.70,00:37:03.70,"Switch, jump ship here."
861,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,'Cause it's a game of survival.
862,00:37:06.27,00:37:06.27,"I mean, this is a game."
863,00:37:07.47,00:37:07.47,-TED: You guys ready? -CLAY: Ready.
864,00:37:11.73,00:37:11.73, Just a matter of  who trusts who the most.
865,00:37:13.63,00:37:13.63, That's where  we're at right now.
866,00:37:14.90,00:37:14.90, Who's got a little bit  of control.
867,00:37:16.50,00:37:16.50,"Right now, I got a little bit of both."
868,00:37:40.70,00:37:40.70,We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
869,00:37:45.53,00:37:45.53,"Erin, Ken, and our newest jury member, Penny,"
870,00:37:48.53,00:37:48.53,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
871,00:37:51.47,00:37:51.47,"So, Chuay Jai, based on the visit from your loved ones,"
872,00:37:54.97,00:37:54.97,I'm just guessing that the last three days
873,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,have been probably the most emotional
874,00:37:59.50,00:37:59.50,you guys have had in a while.
875,00:38:01.43,00:38:01.43,Clay?
876,00:38:02.67,00:38:02.67,"Without a doubt, the most emotional,"
877,00:38:04.67,00:38:04.67,"uh, probably in my life."
878,00:38:07.10,00:38:07.10,"How much fun was it for you, Helen,"
879,00:38:08.87,00:38:08.87,"not only to have Jim, your husband here, but"
880,00:38:11.70,00:38:11.70,to have him experience your new family?
881,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,It was absolute-- I don't know--
882,00:38:16.20,00:38:16.20,it was the best medicine I could have ever had
883,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,to have him with me.
884,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,I wasn't hungry that night.
885,00:38:20.77,00:38:20.77,But I loved today.
886,00:38:22.27,00:38:22.27,I got to see Jim again and I got to meet everybody else's
887,00:38:26.00,00:38:26.00,family member that we've heard about this whole time.
888,00:38:28.87,00:38:28.87,"And it's a tough, it's a tough platform to walk,"
889,00:38:32.60,00:38:32.60,because I don't want to say good-bye to any of these people.
890,00:38:35.90,00:38:35.90,"Clay, does an experience like today impact, at all,"
891,00:38:39.13,00:38:39.13,how you vote?
892,00:38:40.27,00:38:40.27,It was already made up before I got here.
893,00:38:41.93,00:38:41.93,"I mean, we've had a little tension in camp,"
894,00:38:44.30,00:38:44.30,"and, uh, it's not gonna be there after tonight."
895,00:38:46.57,00:38:46.57,"I mean, regardless of what happened here on the island,"
896,00:38:48.80,00:38:48.80,"we've all bonded,"
897,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,"and, uh, there's a friendship here that, uh,"
898,00:38:53.07,00:38:53.07,you can't lick.
899,00:38:54.10,00:38:54.10,"And, uh, we'll be friends forever."
900,00:38:55.80,00:38:55.80,"Jake, what are you basing your vote on tonight?"
901,00:38:58.40,00:38:58.40,"Well, I really don't know,"
902,00:38:59.60,00:38:59.60,'cause I really like all these people.
903,00:39:01.50,00:39:01.50,They got a little upset with me because I played a game.
904,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,That's okay.
905,00:39:05.57,00:39:05.57,This is the way it turned out.
906,00:39:07.50,00:39:07.50,It's been an incredible experience for me.
907,00:39:09.80,00:39:09.80,"Brian, at this point in the game,"
908,00:39:12.00,00:39:12.00,are you voting to get rid of somebody or are you voting
909,00:39:14.00,00:39:14.00,for who you want to keep around?
910,00:39:15.63,00:39:15.63,"Well, at this point in the game, we still do have"
911,00:39:17.40,00:39:17.40,"a little bit of time, but, uh, I think the person who, uh,"
912,00:39:21.27,00:39:21.27,"is probably not gonna be here tonight,"
913,00:39:22.97,00:39:22.97,"uh, brought this upon himself,"
914,00:39:24.43,00:39:24.43,"uh, with certain actions and certain, uh, events"
915,00:39:27.77,00:39:27.77,"that, uh, could have been, uh, prevented, I think."
916,00:39:30.53,00:39:30.53,Simple as that. It's just about moving forward.
917,00:39:32.60,00:39:32.60,"Big Ted, you are wearing the immunity necklace."
918,00:39:35.47,00:39:35.47,You're safe with it.
919,00:39:36.37,00:39:36.37,Everybody else is fair game.
920,00:39:37.67,00:39:37.67,It is time to vote.
921,00:39:38.67,00:39:38.67,"Helen, you're up."
922,00:40:02.20,00:40:02.20,"Jake, let bygones be bygones."
923,00:40:04.20,00:40:04.20,We're too close of neighbors to be enemies.
924,00:40:19.20,00:40:19.20,"Positivity goes a long, long way, my friend."
925,00:40:21.00,00:40:21.00,You need a little bit more positivity in your life.
926,00:40:49.43,00:40:49.43,I'll go tally the votes.
927,00:41:01.20,00:41:01.20,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
928,00:41:03.03,00:41:03.03,Person will be asked to leave
929,00:41:04.23,00:41:04.23,the Tribal Council area immediately.
930,00:41:05.83,00:41:05.83,I'll read the votes.
931,00:41:12.47,00:41:12.47,Jake.
932,00:41:18.63,00:41:18.63,Jake.
933,00:41:25.00,00:41:25.00,Jake.
934,00:41:31.60,00:41:31.60,Jake. That's four and that's enough.
935,00:41:33.10,00:41:33.10,No need to read the last votes.
936,00:41:34.70,00:41:34.70,Need to bring me your torch.
937,00:41:44.53,00:41:44.53,"Jake, the tribe has spoken."
938,00:41:49.33,00:41:49.33,It's time for you to go.
939,00:41:51.20,00:41:51.20,"Thanks, guys."
940,00:41:52.23,00:41:52.23,Good luck to all of you.
941,00:41:53.90,00:41:53.90,I'll see you.
942,00:41:55.03,00:41:55.03,Take it easy.
943,00:42:12.90,00:42:12.90,"PROBST: I gotta say,"
944,00:42:14.93,00:42:14.93,I'm fascinated that after everything that went on
945,00:42:18.27,00:42:18.27,"the last three days,"
946,00:42:19.57,00:42:19.57,"still another easy vote, right down tribal lines,"
947,00:42:23.57,00:42:23.57,without so much as a hesitation.
948,00:42:26.50,00:42:26.50,"Well, you made it to the final five."
949,00:42:28.33,00:42:28.33,All five of you are from the same tribe.
950,00:42:30.60,00:42:30.60,"Game's about to get very, very complicated."
951,00:42:34.83,00:42:34.83,Guys can head back to camp.
952,00:42:36.53,00:42:36.53,Good night.
953,00:42:47.90,00:42:47.90, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
954,00:42:53.97,00:42:53.97,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
955,00:42:55.20,00:42:55.20, The former Chuay Gahns  turn on each other.
956,00:42:57.77,00:42:57.77,"TED: Those that I've trusted,  I'm gonna continue to trust,"
957,00:43:00.67,00:43:00.67, but I'm not gonna base  the results of this game
958,00:43:03.87,00:43:03.87,on that trust.
959,00:43:06.10,00:43:06.10,PROBST: The castaways  reflect on their new looks.
960,00:43:08.37,00:43:08.37,All my damn teeth are yellow.
961,00:43:09.90,00:43:09.90, And a Survivor getaway.
962,00:43:11.20,00:43:11.20,"(cheering, laughter)"
963,00:43:12.93,00:43:12.93,(speaks Thai)
964,00:43:19.10,00:43:19.10,I'm almost 61.
965,00:43:20.27,00:43:20.27,"In fact, I'll be 61 here just real quick."
966,00:43:22.87,00:43:22.87, So I was kind of  looking forward to
967,00:43:24.77,00:43:24.77," a little retirement income,  but you know what?"
968,00:43:27.03,00:43:27.03," When one door shuts,  another always opens."
969,00:43:29.80,00:43:29.80, And I had such  a grand experience here.
970,00:43:32.77,00:43:32.77," I'll go back home to Texas, and I'll be back with my Jenny,"
971,00:43:36.07,00:43:36.07,and I'll be the happiest little guy in the world.
