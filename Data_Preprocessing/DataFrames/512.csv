1,00:00:01.07,00:00:01.07,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor... Brian won
2,00:00:04.37,00:00:04.37, the reward challenge and chose to take Clay with him
3,00:00:07.37,00:00:07.37," o the mainland, for an elephant trek."
4,00:00:09.07,00:00:09.07,"BRIAN: We're more than halfway  through the game, and this is"
5,00:00:11.33,00:00:11.33," an excellent time for us to just clear our heads,"
6,00:00:12.90,00:00:12.90,get away from everyone.
7,00:00:14.80,00:00:14.80,"TED: I kind of knew there was a bond between Clay and Brian,"
8,00:00:18.10,00:00:18.10,but the fact that he didselect Clay kind of just told me
9,00:00:20.43,00:00:20.43,that that bond is closerthan what I thought it was.
10,00:00:22.47,00:00:22.47,"PROBST: Back at camp,"
11,00:00:24.10,00:00:24.10, Jake was trying hard to stay in the game.
12,00:00:27.17,00:00:27.17, He tried to convince Helen to turn on Brian or Clay.
13,00:00:30.47,00:00:30.47,"JAKE: Course, if she got rid of Brian and Clay,"
14,00:00:32.73,00:00:32.73,I think I'd be back in the hunt.
15,00:00:34.47,00:00:34.47,PROBST: Penny was alsofighting to stay on the island.
16,00:00:37.47,00:00:37.47, She severed her ties with former ally Jake
17,00:00:40.30,00:00:40.30, when she helped eliminate him from the immunity challenge.
18,00:00:42.40,00:00:42.40,PENNY: I was trying to send a message to Chuay Gahn that
19,00:00:46.53,00:00:46.53,Jake and I don't really havean alliance anymore.
20,00:00:49.10,00:00:49.10,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, Jake spoke out in desperation."
21,00:00:52.83,00:00:52.83,"At last Tribal Council,"
22,00:00:54.27,00:00:54.27,I heard from this tribethat they vote people off
23,00:00:57.33,00:00:57.33,based on howa person really performs.
24,00:00:59.83,00:00:59.83,"I think my performance stands upto everybody's on the tribe,"
25,00:01:02.63,00:01:02.63,and I'll be kind of curioustonight if that still holds up.
26,00:01:06.87,00:01:06.87,"PROBST: When the votes came in, Penny took the fall."
27,00:01:09.40,00:01:09.40,"Penny, the tribe has spoken."
28,00:01:12.67,00:01:12.67, Six are left.
29,00:01:14.03,00:01:14.03," Tonight, one more will go."
30,00:02:30.03,00:02:30.03,"JAN: During Tribal Council,"
31,00:02:32.40,00:02:32.40," Jake said, ""I feel like I'm one of the hardest workers"
32,00:02:34.90,00:02:34.90," ""out here; a lot harder worker"
33,00:02:36.90,00:02:36.90," than some of the others in the tribe."""
34,00:02:39.40,00:02:39.40,And Clay doesn't really simmerwith things like that real well.
35,00:02:43.67,00:02:43.67,How'd you like that statement
36,00:02:45.07,00:02:45.07,up thereat that Council meeting?
37,00:02:46.30,00:02:46.30,But we know wherenumber day three lays.
38,00:02:50.10,00:02:50.10,"JACK: What they said last Tribal Council was,"
39,00:02:52.93,00:02:52.93,anybody that did not producewas the one who was going.
40,00:02:55.73,00:02:55.73,"And I gotta tell you,I'll put my production up,"
41,00:02:58.53,00:02:58.53," basically, against anybody's."
42,00:03:00.57,00:03:00.57, And that offended Clay.
43,00:03:02.10,00:03:02.10,CLAY: I think everybody in thiscamp works just as hard as you.
44,00:03:04.17,00:03:04.17,"JAKE: No, I didn't say I workedany harder. I just said that--"
45,00:03:06.53,00:03:06.53,"CLAY: Well, somebody's gotto get their ass kicked off."
46,00:03:08.23,00:03:08.23,"HELEN: Quite frankly, I don't think Clay"
47,00:03:10.27,00:03:10.27," liked that playing at Tribal Council,"
48,00:03:13.00,00:03:13.00,because it was true.
49,00:03:15.00,00:03:15.00,Jake does more than Clay.
50,00:03:16.57,00:03:16.57,Why do you think Clay got upset?
51,00:03:18.70,00:03:18.70, People working know they're working.
52,00:03:20.17,00:03:20.17, The people skating
53,00:03:21.80,00:03:21.80,know they're skating.
54,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,And he was ticked
55,00:03:23.90,00:03:23.90, that Jake brought that up.
56,00:03:25.40,00:03:25.40,CLAY: We thoughtyou were a bigger person--
57,00:03:27.67,00:03:27.67,that we'd think you'd juststand up and slap all five
58,00:03:30.10,00:03:30.10,of us right square in the face.
59,00:03:31.63,00:03:31.63,-I didn't slap anybody.-You slapped all five of us
60,00:03:33.60,00:03:33.60,right square in the face--the hell you didn't.
61,00:03:35.57,00:03:35.57,"No, what I said was, see,at the last Tribal Council..."
62,00:03:38.17,00:03:38.17,I'm gonna test y'all to seeif y'all are sayin'
63,00:03:40.60,00:03:40.60,what y'all are doing--that the people that work
64,00:03:42.07,00:03:42.07,get to stay on the tribe.
65,00:03:43.97,00:03:43.97,TED: Clay is definitely starting to get on my nerves.
66,00:03:45.77,00:03:45.77,"The outburst that he had,I thought,"
67,00:03:48.00,00:03:48.00,"was very, very childishand uncalled for."
68,00:03:50.90,00:03:50.90, I didn't see anything wrong with Jake's comment.
69,00:03:54.80,00:03:54.80, It was just words.
70,00:03:56.03,00:03:56.03, So what if he felt that way?
71,00:03:58.03,00:03:58.03,Who gives a heck?
72,00:03:59.70,00:03:59.70,Are you proud of me?
73,00:04:01.53,00:04:01.53,"That was messed up,what you did."
74,00:04:04.23,00:04:04.23,(Clay chuckles)
75,00:04:05.93,00:04:05.93,CLAY:It had to be said.
76,00:04:08.70,00:04:08.70,Just had to.
77,00:04:11.93,00:04:11.93,I just had to.
78,00:04:44.00,00:04:44.00,31 days.
79,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,"Overall, we'rephysically whupped."
80,00:04:49.10,00:04:49.10,"You take 31 days in a cave,living off"
81,00:04:52.30,00:04:52.30, whatever you can find.
82,00:04:53.60,00:04:53.60," I've lost way, way too much weight."
83,00:04:55.20,00:04:55.20," I miss my family,"
84,00:04:56.47,00:04:56.47," I miss home, and we're to the point now"
85,00:04:58.37,00:04:58.37, where you can start smelling it.
86,00:04:59.93,00:04:59.93," You know it's coming, it's not long."
87,00:05:06.30,00:05:06.30, JAKE: Every day I spend a little bit of time
88,00:05:09.77,00:05:09.77, just kind of jotting down
89,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,what I've been doing here.
90,00:05:13.20,00:05:13.20,"You know, it's kind of likea letter to my wife."
91,00:05:15.07,00:05:15.07,"In fact, it is a letterto my wife--"
92,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77," a little journal of what's  happening through the day,"
93,00:05:20.27,00:05:20.27," and with a lot of ""I miss you"" kind of stuff"
94,00:05:24.07,00:05:24.07, rolled into it.
95,00:05:25.37,00:05:25.37," I can see the ending's in sight and, uh,"
96,00:05:30.40,00:05:30.40,I just sit here waiting onthe next challenge.
97,00:05:42.97,00:05:42.97,"Oh, boy, mail delivery."
98,00:05:44.10,00:05:44.10,-Mail call!-JAN: Mail!
99,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,Mail call!
100,00:05:46.33,00:05:46.33,Oh! It's beautiful.
101,00:05:48.90,00:05:48.90,We get a sneak peek.
102,00:05:49.97,00:05:49.97,-(Jan gasps)-We get to sneak peak.
103,00:05:51.53,00:05:51.53,-Oh-oh-oh-oh!-We're gonna eat.
104,00:05:52.60,00:05:52.60,We're gonna eat.We're gonna eat.
105,00:05:53.87,00:05:53.87, Helen and I went down and got treemail.
106,00:05:55.83,00:05:55.83,It was ina real neat little container.
107,00:05:57.60,00:05:57.60,"We opened it up andthere was rice-- oh, God!--"
108,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,so we were so excited.
109,00:06:00.80,00:06:00.80,We're eating! We're eating!
110,00:06:03.37,00:06:03.37,"JAN:Hey, guys!"

113,00:06:07.93,00:06:07.93,"JAKE: Oh, my gosh, the girlscame sprinting back up there."
114,00:06:10.87,00:06:10.87,"Now these are peoplewho can hardly walk,"
115,00:06:12.83,00:06:12.83,and they sprinted up here.
116,00:06:14.07,00:06:14.07,What? What?
117,00:06:15.20,00:06:15.20,TED: You're running.What? What?
118,00:06:17.07,00:06:17.07,"""Good food is luxury.You need nourishment at least,"

820,00:35:17.50,00:35:17.50, to be able to experience
821,00:35:21.37,00:35:21.37,33 days in a caveand on a beach...
822,00:35:25.73,00:35:25.73,without your loved oneand then to be able to see them.
823,00:35:28.60,00:35:28.60, And how it makes you feel.
824,00:35:47.70,00:35:47.70,Next plan of attack.
825,00:35:48.77,00:35:48.77,I'll be back in a minute.
826,00:35:50.13,00:35:50.13,"-Oh, you got to go?-Yeah."
827,00:35:51.93,00:35:51.93,HELEN: I have to get Brian aside
828,00:35:54.40,00:35:54.40, and run some strategy by him
829,00:35:56.67,00:35:56.67,and just get someopinion work done there.
830,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,I don't trust Clay.
831,00:36:01.33,00:36:01.33,"I don't, I'm sorry."
832,00:36:02.87,00:36:02.87,"Do you feel that he has earned,"
833,00:36:05.97,00:36:05.97,"through merit,a number one or two spot?"
834,00:36:08.77,00:36:08.77, I trust Brian.
835,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,I don't think Brian wouldever look at me
836,00:36:11.73,00:36:11.73,"and try to dupe me on something,"
837,00:36:13.53,00:36:13.53, play me for a fool.
838,00:36:14.57,00:36:14.57, And I wouldn't do that to him.
839,00:36:15.90,00:36:15.90,I hear you.
840,00:36:17.03,00:36:17.03,"Um, what you're saying."
841,00:36:18.97,00:36:18.97,"And I'm, uh, I'm consideringthat as well."
842,00:36:21.40,00:36:21.40,HELEN: But I talked about perhaps
843,00:36:23.73,00:36:23.73,pulling in Ted and Janand trying to form
844,00:36:25.83,00:36:25.83, a threesome and take out Clay.
845,00:36:27.77,00:36:27.77,I don't want him in that spot.
846,00:36:29.17,00:36:29.17,-So...-Okay.
847,00:36:30.40,00:36:30.40,"Let me, um--I gotta dwell on that."
848,00:36:32.27,00:36:32.27,-We worked the whole time.-I know. I know.
849,00:36:34.60,00:36:34.60,There wasn't a job we didn't do.
850,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17," Quite frankly, Clay does squat at camp."
851,00:36:39.87,00:36:39.87,He has gone on one
852,00:36:43.07,00:36:43.07," water run in 32 days, and he swamped the boat when he went."
853,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,That stuff goes right up my...(mumbles)
854,00:36:49.93,00:36:49.93,...and hell no!
855,00:36:51.63,00:36:51.63,"BRIAN: So... I was, like,I'm not sure about Clay."
856,00:36:56.20,00:36:56.20,This is where practical logicalbusiness sense comes into mind
857,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,and you've got to have--keep your mind open
858,00:37:02.33,00:37:02.33,and then adapt accordingly.
859,00:37:03.70,00:37:03.70,"Switch, jump ship here."
860,00:37:04.90,00:37:04.90,'Cause it's a game of survival.
861,00:37:06.27,00:37:06.27,"I mean, this is a game."
862,00:37:07.47,00:37:07.47,-TED: You guys ready?-CLAY: Ready.
863,00:37:11.73,00:37:11.73, Just a matter of who trusts who the most.
864,00:37:13.63,00:37:13.63, That's where we're at right now.
865,00:37:14.90,00:37:14.90, Who's got a little bit of control.
866,00:37:16.50,00:37:16.50,"Right now,I got a little bit of both."
867,00:37:40.70,00:37:40.70,We'll now bring inthe members of our jury.
868,00:37:45.53,00:37:45.53,"Erin, Ken, and our newestjury member, Penny,"
869,00:37:48.53,00:37:48.53,voted out at the lastTribal Council.
870,00:37:51.47,00:37:51.47,"So, Chuay Jai, based onthe visit from your loved ones,"
871,00:37:54.97,00:37:54.97,I'm just guessingthat the last three days
872,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,have been probablythe most emotional
873,00:37:59.50,00:37:59.50,you guys have hadin a while.
874,00:38:01.43,00:38:01.43,Clay?
875,00:38:02.67,00:38:02.67,"Without a doubt,the most emotional,"
876,00:38:04.67,00:38:04.67,"uh, probably in my life."
877,00:38:07.10,00:38:07.10,"How much fun was itfor you, Helen,"
878,00:38:08.87,00:38:08.87,"not only to have Jim,your husband here, but"
879,00:38:11.70,00:38:11.70,to have him experienceyour new family?
880,00:38:14.67,00:38:14.67,It was absolute-- I don't know--
881,00:38:16.20,00:38:16.20,it was the best medicineI could have ever had
882,00:38:18.00,00:38:18.00,to have him with me.
883,00:38:19.00,00:38:19.00,I wasn't hungry that night.
884,00:38:20.77,00:38:20.77,But I loved today.
885,00:38:22.27,00:38:22.27,I got to see Jim again andI got to meet everybody else's
886,00:38:26.00,00:38:26.00,family member that we've heardabout this whole time.
887,00:38:28.87,00:38:28.87,"And it's a tough,it's a tough platform to walk,"
888,00:38:32.60,00:38:32.60,because I don't want to saygood-bye to any of these people.
889,00:38:35.90,00:38:35.90,"Clay, does an experiencelike today impact, at all,"
890,00:38:39.13,00:38:39.13,how you vote?
891,00:38:40.27,00:38:40.27,It was already made upbefore I got here.
892,00:38:41.93,00:38:41.93,"I mean, we've hada little tension in camp,"
893,00:38:44.30,00:38:44.30,"and, uh, it's not gonna be thereafter tonight."
894,00:38:46.57,00:38:46.57,"I mean, regardless of whathappened here on the island,"
895,00:38:48.80,00:38:48.80,"we've all bonded,"
896,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,"and, uh, there's a friendshiphere that, uh,"
897,00:38:53.07,00:38:53.07,you can't lick.
898,00:38:54.10,00:38:54.10,"And, uh, we'll befriends forever."
899,00:38:55.80,00:38:55.80,"Jake, what are youbasing your vote on tonight?"
900,00:38:58.40,00:38:58.40,"Well, I really don't know,"
901,00:38:59.60,00:38:59.60,'cause I really likeall these people.
902,00:39:01.50,00:39:01.50,They got a little upset with mebecause I played a game.
903,00:39:04.37,00:39:04.37,That's okay.
904,00:39:05.57,00:39:05.57,This is the way it turned out.
905,00:39:07.50,00:39:07.50,It's been an incredibleexperience for me.
906,00:39:09.80,00:39:09.80,"Brian, at this pointin the game,"
907,00:39:12.00,00:39:12.00,are you voting to get rid ofsomebody or are you voting
908,00:39:14.00,00:39:14.00,for who you want to keep around?
909,00:39:15.63,00:39:15.63,"Well, at this point in the game,we still do have"
910,00:39:17.40,00:39:17.40,"a little bit of time, but, uh,I think the person who, uh,"
911,00:39:21.27,00:39:21.27,"is probably notgonna be here tonight,"
912,00:39:22.97,00:39:22.97,"uh, brought this upon himself,"
913,00:39:24.43,00:39:24.43,"uh, with certain actionsand certain, uh, events"
914,00:39:27.77,00:39:27.77,"that, uh, could have been,uh, prevented, I think."
915,00:39:30.53,00:39:30.53,Simple as that.It's just about moving forward.
916,00:39:32.60,00:39:32.60,"Big Ted, you are wearingthe immunity necklace."
917,00:39:35.47,00:39:35.47,You're safe with it.
918,00:39:36.37,00:39:36.37,Everybody else is fair game.
919,00:39:37.67,00:39:37.67,It is time to vote.
920,00:39:38.67,00:39:38.67,"Helen, you're up."
921,00:40:02.20,00:40:02.20,"Jake, let bygones be bygones."
922,00:40:04.20,00:40:04.20,We're too close of neighborsto be enemies.
923,00:40:19.20,00:40:19.20,"Positivity goesa long, long way, my friend."
924,00:40:21.00,00:40:21.00,You need a little bit morepositivity in your life.
925,00:40:49.43,00:40:49.43,I'll go tally the votes.
926,00:41:01.20,00:41:01.20,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."

928,00:41:04.23,00:41:04.23,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.

934,00:41:33.10,00:41:33.10,No need to read the last votes.
935,00:41:34.70,00:41:34.70,Need to bring me your torch.
936,00:41:44.53,00:41:44.53,"Jake, the tribe has spoken."
937,00:41:49.33,00:41:49.33,It's time for you to go.

946,00:42:23.57,00:42:23.57,without so much as a hesitation.
947,00:42:26.50,00:42:26.50,"Well, you made itto the final five."
948,00:42:28.33,00:42:28.33,All five of youare from the same tribe.
949,00:42:30.60,00:42:30.60,"Game's about to getvery, very complicated."
950,00:42:34.83,00:42:34.83,Guys can head back to camp.
951,00:42:36.53,00:42:36.53,Good night.

956,00:43:00.67,00:43:00.67, but I'm not gonna base the results of this game
957,00:43:03.87,00:43:03.87,on that trust.
958,00:43:06.10,00:43:06.10,PROBST: The castaways reflect on their new looks.

961,00:43:11.20,00:43:11.20,"(cheering, laughter)"

965,00:43:22.87,00:43:22.87, So I was kind of looking forward to
966,00:43:24.77,00:43:24.77," a little retirement income, but you know what?"
