193,00:12:36.57,00:12:36.57,>> Yep.>> Yep.

198,00:13:04.37,00:13:04.37,"Going to pull up that bucketfull of water, and then pour it"
199,00:13:07.63,00:13:07.63,"down that bamboo chute.The more water you get in, the"
200,00:13:13.33,00:13:13.33,faster you will raise those keysup to where you can grab them.
201,00:13:26.97,00:13:26.97,Natalie having a lot of success.Parvati got most of it in the
202,00:13:31.93,00:13:31.93,chute.Doesn't matter how fast you pull
203,00:13:35.00,00:13:35.00,up the water if you don't pourit in the chute.
204,00:13:41.33,00:13:41.33,Natalie doing a great job.Can't quite reach her keys.
205,00:13:46.57,00:13:46.57,Parvati and Natalie neck andneck right now.
206,00:13:56.87,00:13:56.87,Natalie has her keys.She's in the water.
207,00:14:03.67,00:14:03.67,Parvati very close.Parvati reaching for her keys.
208,00:14:09.53,00:14:09.53,Parvati unclips.She's in the water.
209,00:14:14.10,00:14:14.10,Got to get to shore and openthat chest.
210,00:14:17.83,00:14:17.83,Amanda reaching for those keys.Can't do it.
211,00:14:21.20,00:14:21.20,Going to take another bucket ofwater.
212,00:14:24.00,00:14:24.00,Natalie and Parvati with a biglead at this point.
213,00:14:26.50,00:14:26.50,Both opening their chests up.Amanda has her set of keys.
214,00:14:39.87,00:14:39.87,Got to unclip.She's in the water.

216,00:14:50.97,00:14:50.97,Cirie has her keys!Get in that water.
217,00:14:56.70,00:14:56.70,Everybody is in this.Natalie continues to extend her
218,00:15:01.03,00:15:01.03,lead.This ladder will take some time
219,00:15:04.40,00:15:04.40,to assemble.Only one person going to walk
220,00:15:08.63,00:15:08.63,away from here with immunity.The other three vulnerable at
221,00:15:11.43,00:15:11.43,tonight's tribal council.You have 16 ladder rungs.
222,00:15:17.70,00:15:17.70,Each ladder rung is individuallyshaped and will only go into one
223,00:15:22.40,00:15:22.40,"slot on that ladder.If you have to force it, it's"
224,00:15:26.70,00:15:26.70,"not right.If you have a lot of play, it's"
225,00:15:29.10,00:15:29.10,"not right.16 different options, but it"
226,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,only goes together one way.Amanda appears to be making some
227,00:15:44.83,00:15:44.83,progress.Parvati's got some rungs in her
228,00:15:48.07,00:15:48.07,ladder.Natalie and Cirie trying to make
229,00:15:50.33,00:15:50.33,sure they're right.Merely getting to the top is not
230,00:15:53.43,00:15:53.43,enough.Amanda making a lot of progress.
231,00:15:57.73,00:15:57.73,"If she's right, that's a biglead."
232,00:16:02.43,00:16:02.43,Parvati skipping up ahead.Putting some of the higher
233,00:16:05.77,00:16:05.77,ladder rungs in first.Cirie is working her way up
234,00:16:09.23,00:16:09.23,methodically from the bottom.Natalie having a little trouble
235,00:16:14.37,00:16:14.37,with this puzzle.Amanda pulling away from the
236,00:16:17.83,00:16:17.83,"pack.At this point, it is Amanda's"
237,00:16:22.13,00:16:22.13,challenge to lose.She has a huge lead.
238,00:16:30.17,00:16:30.17,Amanda can't get that last rungin.
239,00:16:33.07,00:16:33.07,Something's not right.Amanda going now rung by rung
240,00:16:36.20,00:16:36.20,trying to figure out where she'soff.
241,00:16:39.43,00:16:39.43,Natalie getting closer.Amanda swapping pieces out.
242,00:16:46.10,00:16:46.10,"Immunity so close.Amanda thinks she has it, and"
243,00:16:54.13,00:16:54.13,she does.Amanda wins immunity!
244,00:16:59.27,00:16:59.27,">> Good job, girl.>> Good job."
245,00:17:04.17,00:17:04.17,">> Oh, my god!>> Good job, girl."
246,00:17:06.83,00:17:06.83,"That was tough.>> JEFF: Amanda, come on over."
247,00:17:11.90,00:17:11.90,Congratulations.>> Thank you.
248,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,>> JEFF: Guaranteed a one-in-three shot at winning this game
249,00:17:20.37,00:17:20.37,and the million bucks that goeswith it.
250,00:17:22.63,00:17:22.63,"Natalie, Cirie, Parvati, after37 hard-fought days, one of you"
251,00:17:25.60,00:17:25.60,will not make it to the final.Figure out who that's going to
252,00:17:28.97,00:17:28.97,"be tonight at tribal council.Grab your stuff, head out."
253,00:17:31.13,00:17:31.13,See you at tribal.>> The only reason you beat me
254,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,is because your legs are longerthan mine.
255,00:17:50.17,00:17:50.17,">> Right.>> Me, too."
256,00:17:52.10,00:17:52.10,>> I was right hot on yourtrail.
257,00:17:53.73,00:17:53.73,">> Oh, I know, girl.>> We all were."
258,00:17:58.23,00:17:58.23,>> I'm in the final three.I can't believe it.

260,00:18:03.87,00:18:03.87,"And that's, like, twice in arow."
261,00:18:06.60,00:18:06.60,"And this time I have played mygame so different, and I feel so"
262,00:18:09.33,00:18:09.33,much better about it.>> We could set Gloria free.
263,00:18:22.50,00:18:22.50,">> You know, they always talkabout the lowest man on the"
264,00:18:24.93,00:18:24.93,totem pole.I do indeed feel like the low

266,00:18:31.17,00:18:31.17,"tail between my legs and scurryout of here and say, ""Bye, guys,"
267,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,"well, it was great, I'm goinghome""?"
268,00:18:37.03,00:18:37.03,"No, I'm going to explore all myoptions."
269,00:18:40.10,00:18:40.10,"If Gloria is anything like thewomen on this camp, she'll mate"
270,00:18:43.70,00:18:43.70,with that dude and then rip hisneck off.
271,00:18:48.57,00:18:48.57,">> Oh, that's funny.>> I'm dealing women who are as"
272,00:18:52.33,00:18:52.33,smart as I am.So if I go in and I'm hustling
273,00:18:54.73,00:18:54.73,"and I'm shaking and I'm movingand I'm stressing, they're going"
274,00:18:58.03,00:18:58.03,"to see right through it.So I think if I'm calm, cool,"
275,00:19:00.77,00:19:00.77,and collected there's a way toweasel in and communicate with
276,00:19:03.60,00:19:03.60,them in a way that may seemreasonable.
277,00:19:20.57,00:19:20.57,>> This sucks.I hate when it gets to this
278,00:19:23.97,00:19:23.97,point.Why can't we all just stay?
279,00:19:27.13,00:19:27.13,Why can't they have a finalfour?
280,00:19:29.13,00:19:29.13,">> That would be cool.>> I don't know, Natty, girl."
281,00:19:34.73,00:19:34.73,I don't know.Have you promised anybody your
282,00:19:37.83,00:19:37.83,"vote?Oh, good."
283,00:19:41.73,00:19:41.73,>> No.>> Good.
284,00:19:48.00,00:19:48.00,>> I believe Cirie is quitenervous as far as jury votes are
285,00:19:50.20,00:19:50.20,concerned.I could use this to address
286,00:19:53.40,00:19:53.40,Parvati to help me out.It's kind of a little glimmer at
287,00:19:56.83,00:19:56.83,"the end of the tunnel, a littlelight, because I do firmly"
288,00:19:59.23,00:19:59.23,believe that Parvati would goout on a limb for me.
289,00:20:06.10,00:20:06.10,>> Huh?>> How good of a shot do we have
290,00:20:09.47,00:20:09.47,"to win this, do you think?>> Huge."

292,00:20:12.93,00:20:12.93,I think it's between you and I.>> Really?
293,00:20:14.57,00:20:14.57,>> Mm-hmm.>> Definitely.
294,00:20:22.50,00:20:22.50,>> It's been kind of our planfrom pretty much the beginning
295,00:20:26.03,00:20:26.03,"to have me, Parv and Cirie inthe final three."
296,00:20:28.93,00:20:28.93,But I think Cirie is definitelya threat as far as swaying
297,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,votes from the jury one way orthe other.
298,00:20:34.63,00:20:34.63,"And I don't want Natalie to go.I think, you know, she"
299,00:20:36.93,00:20:36.93,definitely deserves to be here.I think she's played a good
300,00:20:38.87,00:20:38.87,"game.Cirie, she knows that if Natalie"
301,00:20:44.03,00:20:44.03,"would have won, Nat would havevoted with me and you and Cirie"
302,00:20:46.83,00:20:46.83,would have been gone.>> True.
303,00:20:49.97,00:20:49.97,>> I don't know who I'm votingfor tonight.
304,00:20:51.80,00:20:51.80,"I mean, it's hard.It's far in the game."
305,00:20:53.80,00:20:53.80,"You know, it's not easy.You know everyone is still"
306,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,playing the game at this point.It would be stupid not to still
307,00:20:59.13,00:20:59.13,be playing the game.>> I give Natalie so much
308,00:21:01.70,00:21:01.70,"credit.>> Me, too."
309,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73,>> Cirie got lucky to be withus.
310,00:21:11.87,00:21:11.87,>> Yeah.>> You okay?
311,00:21:25.87,00:21:25.87,>> Mm-hmm.>> I was like...
312,00:21:31.90,00:21:31.90,"""No.You're asking me this right now"

314,00:21:45.43,00:21:45.43,I think she's a lesser threat asfar as jury votes than Cirie.
315,00:21:49.30,00:21:49.30,"And now the time has come whereit's, like, I could switch it up"
316,00:21:54.47,00:21:54.47,"now, and then we have ourbiggest jury threat out of the"
317,00:21:57.63,00:21:57.63,"game.But, seriously, in this game,"
318,00:22:00.63,00:22:00.63,"and how this game's been playedall these women are so crafty, I"
319,00:22:04.70,00:22:04.70,wouldn't put it past any singleone of us to work some kind of
320,00:22:07.87,00:22:07.87,deal out and make it to thethree.
321,00:22:14.63,00:22:14.63,>> Yeah.>> Yeah.
322,00:22:25.77,00:22:25.77,>> I could be going hometonight.
323,00:22:28.07,00:22:28.07,"They could have made a deal withNatalie and decided, ""You know"

326,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,I saw their work already.We duped so many people....

330,00:23:28.37,00:23:28.37,So we have a final fourconsisting of only women.
331,00:23:33.73,00:23:33.73,And all of you women have beeninvolved in another first-- four

336,00:23:53.90,00:23:53.90,it went down seamlessly.We achieved an impossible task.
337,00:23:57.97,00:23:57.97,So it was a great feeling.>> JEFF: So after four straight
338,00:24:01.97,00:24:01.97,"blindsides, what's the feelinggoing into tonight's vote?"
339,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,">> I think at this point, thefour of us respect each other"
340,00:24:09.63,00:24:09.63,enough that I don't think therewould be a blindside.
341,00:24:12.07,00:24:12.07,I would pray for a blindside onsome level.
342,00:24:16.07,00:24:16.07,Like now it would actuallybenefit me better than all the
343,00:24:18.10,00:24:18.10,"other four.>> JEFF: Amanda, how concerned"
344,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,are you tonight that you knowexactly what's happening?
345,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,">> At this point, Jeff, I haveno idea what's going on."
346,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53,"I mean, how many times does ablindside have to happen before"
347,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,you figure out that you knownothing about what's going on at

352,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,"All you have to do is lookacross at Ozzy, and Jason, and"
353,00:24:51.50,00:24:51.50,"Alexis, and Erik.They were all certain they"

357,00:25:07.63,00:25:07.63,"it's ludicrous.But I can't read anyone's mind,"
358,00:25:10.33,00:25:10.33,and I don't know what anyoneelse is thinking but myself.

375,00:26:02.23,00:26:02.23,the final four.So where does that place me when
376,00:26:04.77,00:26:04.77,we're going to the five?That makes me fifth.

378,00:26:09.10,00:26:09.10,"Like, when have you felt on thebottom?"
379,00:26:11.07,00:26:11.07,>> Always.>> Always?
380,00:26:13.10,00:26:13.10,">> Between us three?It's obvious, because not one"
381,00:26:16.43,00:26:16.43,"person in any alliance has eversaid, ""I won't vote for Cirie."""
382,00:26:21.23,00:26:21.23,"You have said, ""I won't votefor"" certain people."
383,00:26:23.67,00:26:23.67,"She has said, ""I won't vote foryou."""
384,00:26:25.87,00:26:25.87,So that clearly places me at thebottom of the alliance.
385,00:26:28.63,00:26:28.63,>> I'm just wondering.>> And I'm explaining how I feel
386,00:26:31.00,00:26:31.00,that way.I would be foolish not to think
387,00:26:33.80,00:26:33.80,"that.>> JEFF: Natalie, you're holding"
388,00:26:40.20,00:26:40.20,"back a big grin.>> I think at this point,"
389,00:26:43.03,00:26:43.03,"anything's an opportunity.You know, I'm just letting them"
390,00:26:45.33,00:26:45.33,"duke it out, and may the bestwoman win."
391,00:26:51.37,00:26:51.37,">> JEFF: All right, let's get tothe vote."
392,00:26:53.60,00:26:53.60,"Amanda, you have the immunitynecklace, you're not planning on"
393,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,"giving it to anyone else, areyou?"
394,00:26:57.47,00:26:57.47,>> No.>> JEFF: You cannot vote for
395,00:26:59.73,00:26:59.73,Amanda.Everybody else is fair game.
396,00:27:01.43,00:27:01.43,"It is time to vote.Amanda, you're up."
397,00:27:42.93,00:27:42.93,>> JEFF: I'll go tally thevotes.
398,00:27:59.07,00:27:59.07,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
399,00:28:01.03,00:28:01.03,The person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal
400,00:28:03.00,00:28:03.00,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
401,00:28:07.83,00:28:07.83,"First vote, Cirie.Natalie."
402,00:28:17.30,00:28:17.30,"One vote Natalie, one voteCirie."
403,00:28:23.30,00:28:23.30,"Natalie.Two votes Natalie, one vote"
404,00:28:26.43,00:28:26.43,Cirie.14th person voted out and the
405,00:28:32.07,00:28:32.07,"seventh member of our jury,Natalie."
406,00:28:34.37,00:28:34.37,That's three.That's enough.
407,00:28:35.97,00:28:35.97,"You need to bring me your torch.Natalie, the tribe has spoken."
408,00:28:57.13,00:28:57.13,"Time for you to go.Well, once again you have"
409,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,survived the vote and made it tothe final three.
410,00:29:14.17,00:29:14.17,"Congratulations.Grab your torches, head back to"
411,00:29:16.20,00:29:16.20,camp.Good night.
412,00:29:24.67,00:29:24.67,>> I have to say that I ampretty happy with the way that I
413,00:29:26.90,00:29:26.90,played the game.I was the last fan standing.
414,00:29:29.47,00:29:29.47,And I feel proud of the group ofgirls they finished with.
415,00:29:33.80,00:29:33.80,I respect the way that you guysplayed the game with me.
416,00:29:36.10,00:29:36.10,So thank you.>> That was a weird tribal
417,00:29:53.07,00:29:53.07,"tonight, wasn't it?>> I don't think I've ever been"
418,00:29:55.70,00:29:55.70,so exhausted in my entire life.>> You and me both.
419,00:30:01.07,00:30:01.07,>> What am I doing?>> You were trying to make us
420,00:30:02.93,00:30:02.93,look so awful at tribal.>> How?
421,00:30:05.10,00:30:05.10,"You asked me how I think I'm onthe bottom of an alliance, and I"
422,00:30:08.83,00:30:08.83,explained to you every singlealliance that I've been in how
423,00:30:12.13,00:30:12.13,I'm on the bottom.>> That's bull( no audio )
424,00:30:15.40,00:30:15.40,Just be real.>> How is it bull ( no audio )?
425,00:30:18.80,00:30:18.80,That's not game.That's real facts.
426,00:30:21.40,00:30:21.40,That's exactly what this is.I should be...
427,00:30:24.20,00:30:24.20,">> Because in the five, how areyou on the outs?"
428,00:30:26.80,00:30:26.80,">> Because you're snuggled upover there with James, she's"
429,00:30:29.70,00:30:29.70,snuggled up over there withOzzy.
430,00:30:31.77,00:30:31.77,Most of the time y'all four aretogether.
431,00:30:33.60,00:30:33.60,"If you were me, what would youfeel?"
432,00:30:35.73,00:30:35.73,"I mean, be me for a minute.And because I said it out loud,"
433,00:30:38.57,00:30:38.57,you're upset?With this alliance with y'all
434,00:30:41.20,00:30:41.20,"two, she told me she couldn'tvote you."
435,00:30:43.80,00:30:43.80,So that makes me at the bottomof this alliance.
436,00:30:46.13,00:30:46.13,"Have any one of you ever said,""I can't vote Cirie out?"""
437,00:30:49.43,00:30:49.43,>> How do you know?>> Yes or no?
438,00:30:51.60,00:30:51.60,I'm asking you.>> How do you know?
439,00:30:53.13,00:30:53.13,>> Have I talked to you aboutfinal two?
440,00:30:55.37,00:30:55.37,I feel that I've been at thebottom of every single alliance.
441,00:30:58.50,00:30:58.50,">> I just don't see that, and Ihaven't seen that."
442,00:31:00.70,00:31:00.70,I haven't seen that the wholegame.
443,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,>> You're not me.You're not me.
444,00:31:03.87,00:31:03.87,That's why you can't see it.>> I can't understand you when
445,00:31:06.63,00:31:06.63,"you're screaming at me.>> Okay, I'm not screaming."
446,00:31:09.20,00:31:09.20,>> Thank you.>> I can't explain it any more.
447,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,"I don't know how else to say it.>> Yeah, I know."
448,00:31:14.13,00:31:14.13,"I mean, it makes sense.>> I know."
449,00:31:18.07,00:31:18.07,"I'm sorry.>> I'm sorry for yelling at you,"
450,00:31:20.17,00:31:20.17,"but don't...>> No, I know."
451,00:31:22.07,00:31:22.07,I'm just...>> ...accuse me of stuff that
452,00:31:23.80,00:31:23.80,I'm...>> I wasn't trying to accuse
453,00:31:25.67,00:31:25.67,"you.It came out very badly, and I'm"
454,00:31:27.47,00:31:27.47,sorry.I'm just on my breaking point
455,00:31:29.67,00:31:29.67,right now.>> I know.
456,00:31:37.13,00:31:37.13,>> You have two more days.>> I know.
457,00:31:39.40,00:31:39.40,">> Let me give you a hug,because this is pitiful for us"
458,00:31:42.23,00:31:42.23,to make it this far and then yoube...
459,00:31:44.73,00:31:44.73,">> I know, I'm sorry.>> No, it's all right."
460,00:31:46.67,00:31:46.67,It's all right.>> I didn't mean it like that.
461,00:31:49.73,00:31:49.73,I just kind of broke down and Istarted yelling at Cirie about
462,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,stupid things that I don't evenknow why I yelled.
463,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,"And it's...I feel like I've beendoing this forever, you know?"
464,00:32:01.37,00:32:01.37,"Straight from China, I comehere, and it just... I just"
465,00:32:04.00,00:32:04.00,can't take it.I almost lost it when Jeff
466,00:32:07.50,00:32:07.50,"mentioned that there might be afinal two, and I lost it."
467,00:32:11.13,00:32:11.13,>> Oh!>> There's no way it would be a
468,00:32:14.47,00:32:14.47,final two.There's no way.
469,00:32:17.27,00:32:17.27,">> Yeah, don't say that again,Parv, because you've been wrong"
470,00:32:19.67,00:32:19.67,every time.You don't comfort me by saying
471,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,that.It's been the plan from day one
472,00:32:24.93,00:32:24.93,"for Parvati, Amanda, myself tobe final three, and it would"
473,00:32:27.87,00:32:27.87,just break my heart to find outit's going to be a final two.
474,00:32:32.30,00:32:32.30,"So I want to celebrate, butthere's, like, that hint in the"
475,00:32:37.53,00:32:37.53,back of my mind-- don't getfalsely happy and then find out
476,00:32:40.77,00:32:40.77,this is not the end of it.>> It's the final three.
477,00:32:44.00,00:32:44.00,Everybody just needs to chillout.
478,00:32:46.33,00:32:46.33,>> Did you find a machete?Because all that yelling makes
479,00:32:48.60,00:32:48.60,me thirsty.>> 38 days.
480,00:33:04.67,00:33:04.67,I really don't think I will evertouch a coconut again.
481,00:33:07.20,00:33:07.20,>> We need a tree mail here.>> Relax.
482,00:33:12.33,00:33:12.33,>> I am ecstatic to be here inthe final three with these two
483,00:33:17.00,00:33:17.00,girls.At least we assume it's a final
484,00:33:19.10,00:33:19.10,"three.It's been a long road, and we"
485,00:33:23.80,00:33:23.80,feel very blessed to be herewith each other.
486,00:33:26.43,00:33:26.43,"Come on out.>> Come on, Gloria."
487,00:33:28.80,00:33:28.80,">> We're celebrating by settingour mascot free, Gloria."
488,00:33:32.73,00:33:32.73,She's our last chicken standing.>> Get out of there!
489,00:33:36.43,00:33:36.43,>> Yay!>> Uh-oh!
490,00:33:40.63,00:33:40.63,Rather than try to kill Gloriaand have her flopping around
491,00:33:44.27,00:33:44.27,"in misery, we decided we can noteat."
492,00:33:49.30,00:33:49.30,We only have a couple of daysleft.
493,00:33:51.20,00:33:51.20,Let Gloria go.She might not leave here.
494,00:33:53.20,00:33:53.20,This is her home.She's making a nest to lay the
495,00:33:57.73,00:33:57.73,"damn egg.>> Unfortunately, Gloria doesn't"
496,00:34:01.90,00:34:01.90,"want to leave camp.She's, like, hanging around."
497,00:34:04.90,00:34:04.90,She's like a pet dog now.I guess she doesn't realize that
498,00:34:08.53,00:34:08.53,this is over.It's a done deal.
499,00:34:21.40,00:34:21.40,">> We're the craftiest survivorsof all time, to be modest."
500,00:34:24.23,00:34:24.23,>> Nice.Nice.
501,00:34:27.13,00:34:27.13,>> What is it?It doesn't look like food.
502,00:34:30.70,00:34:30.70,>> No.>> What?
503,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,"Oh, my...>> It looks like a challenge."
504,00:34:36.20,00:34:36.20,Freaking paddle.All right.
505,00:34:40.30,00:34:40.30,"""Congratulations, final three.You have done what 17 of your"
506,00:34:45.97,00:34:45.97,fellow tribesmen and women couldnot.
507,00:34:49.23,00:34:49.23,Today you will honor theirmemories before proceeding to
508,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,your final immunity challenge.Get into your boat and head out
509,00:34:56.53,00:34:56.53,to Exile Island.There you will find the torches
510,00:34:59.90,00:34:59.90,of your fallen comrades.Reflect upon them as they each
511,00:35:02.90,00:35:02.90,had a part in getting you tothis point.
512,00:35:05.97,00:35:05.97,"You'll then proceed to yourfinal immunity challenge."""
513,00:35:08.43,00:35:08.43,">> Oh, my god.>> Wow."
514,00:35:12.90,00:35:12.90,">> My heart just dropped.>> All right, let's go, ladies."
515,00:35:20.97,00:35:20.97,">> We got tree mail today, andwe thought there was going to be"
516,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,"like, food, you know, for thefinal three."
517,00:35:29.57,00:35:29.57,And it's another immunitychallenge.
518,00:35:33.80,00:35:33.80,"It's like, when is it going toend, you know?"
519,00:35:35.80,00:35:35.80,"Like, there's only so much youcan take, and then someone has"
520,00:35:37.57,00:35:37.57,"to leave now, like, aftereverything."
521,00:35:40.23,00:35:40.23,"I am so tight with these girls.Like, this just sucks"
522,00:35:42.60,00:35:42.60,completely.>> It's never ending.
523,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,">> I feel sick.>> Me, too."
524,00:36:00.30,00:36:00.30,The fact that it's a final twoand not a final three was almost
525,00:36:05.37,00:36:05.37,"poetic.I mean, we've been blindsiding"
526,00:36:08.37,00:36:08.37,"people left and right, andessentially we got blindsided."
527,00:36:11.77,00:36:11.77,"We thought we had it made.I guess, you know, what goes"
528,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,around comes around.>> Okay.
529,00:36:20.10,00:36:20.10,"...regroup, get it together.>> One more time."
530,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,>> I need to regroup.Now we have to kick it back into
531,00:36:26.87,00:36:26.87,gear and get ready for thisimmunity challenge today.
532,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,"And for me, it's taken me down apeg."
533,00:36:32.57,00:36:32.57,"Like, I feel a little bithumbled."
534,00:36:34.57,00:36:34.57,But I think the rites of passagewill give me a little
535,00:36:36.53,00:36:36.53,"perspective, because it's achance for us to honor everyone"
536,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,"that we fought so hard to beat,and I think we all want to give"
537,00:36:43.10,00:36:43.10,those people credit for beingsuch strong competitors and for
538,00:36:45.87,00:36:45.87,not making it easy on us.>> I can't feel bad.
539,00:36:55.63,00:36:55.63,"Look how far I made it.I mean, we started out with 20"
540,00:36:57.50,00:36:57.50,people.And they were all hard-core
541,00:36:59.93,00:36:59.93,"players, and would love to behere right now."
542,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,"So I want to tip my hat to themand say, you know, ""Good job."
543,00:37:08.60,00:37:08.60,"I beat you, but good job."">> Oh, thank god."
544,00:37:31.00,00:37:31.00,He was actually kind of a decentguy while he lasted.
545,00:37:34.37,00:37:34.37,Let's do it.>> I consider myself the
546,00:37:39.17,00:37:39.17,"cerebral assassin of Survivor.And I'm not going at 100%, I'm"
547,00:37:43.67,00:37:43.67,"not playing.So, you know, to go out on my"
548,00:37:46.20,00:37:46.20,"own terms, I kind of protectedthe legacy of Jonny Fairplay."
549,00:37:48.30,00:37:48.30,"So I'm very happy with that.>> Oh, Mary."
550,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,Didn't really know Mary.>> That's probably the worst
551,00:38:00.80,00:38:00.80,"thing that could ever happen tosomebody on Survivor, is being"
552,00:38:03.13,00:38:03.13,one of the first people votedout of your tribe.
553,00:38:05.47,00:38:05.47,"Maybe I was a strong player andthey saw me as a threat, but I"
554,00:38:08.40,00:38:08.40,"really felt like just a ton ofbricks hit me, and game over."
555,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,>> Yau-Man.Cirie's fiercest competitor.
556,00:38:18.07,00:38:18.07,>> That's only reason he had togo so early is because he was
557,00:38:20.53,00:38:20.53,such a great player.>> When I first walked in and
558,00:38:23.87,00:38:23.87,"someone said that I'm one of themost likable players, I think"
559,00:38:26.77,00:38:26.77,that pretty much sets me apartas a big target.
560,00:38:31.30,00:38:31.30,"Also, my problem, I know, isthat I don't have that, you know"
561,00:38:35.10,00:38:35.10,killer instinct to go up againstsome of these other people.
562,00:38:38.23,00:38:38.23,"But even though I got voted outso early, it's still quite a fun"
563,00:38:42.93,00:38:42.93,"experience.>> Oh, Mikey."
564,00:38:47.93,00:38:47.93,>> Good old Mikey B.He was a fierce competitor.
565,00:38:51.73,00:38:51.73,>> It hurts.It hurts to get sent home that
566,00:38:55.77,00:38:55.77,"early in the game.I was having fun out there, and"
567,00:38:58.43,00:38:58.43,I just wanted to continue tofight.
568,00:39:00.60,00:39:00.60,But it is a life-changingexperience.
569,00:39:03.07,00:39:03.07,And it reminds you that life isgood.
570,00:39:08.43,00:39:08.43,>> Joel.The big guy.
571,00:39:12.30,00:39:12.30,>> Truck was pretty intense.>> That's exactly the words
572,00:39:15.67,00:39:15.67,I was going to use.He was intense.
573,00:39:21.37,00:39:21.37,">> I went in with the goal toplay the game hard, and I feel"
574,00:39:23.90,00:39:23.90,like I did that.But my Survivor experience
575,00:39:27.10,00:39:27.10,should be summed up as failure.My goal was to be there at the
576,00:39:30.67,00:39:30.67,end.And I didn't reach the goal.
577,00:39:33.50,00:39:33.50,"I failed.>> Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan."
578,00:39:38.27,00:39:38.27,">> Jonathan is a smooth talker.He was tough, though, in this"
579,00:39:41.40,00:39:41.40,"game, man.I give him props."
580,00:39:43.37,00:39:43.37,">> Yeah, he wouldn't have quitfor anything."
581,00:39:45.33,00:39:45.33,>> Nothing.>> If he hadn't been taken out
582,00:39:47.10,00:39:47.10,"on medical, he never would havequit."
583,00:39:48.83,00:39:48.83,>> That's so sad.>> Leaving the game for medical
584,00:39:52.97,00:39:52.97,"reasons, I was able to leavewith my head held high, no"
585,00:39:57.47,00:39:57.47,"animosity towards anyone, andthere's nothing that I could"
586,00:40:01.27,00:40:01.27,have done about it.It is something extremely
587,00:40:04.03,00:40:04.03,"special, and I'll always holdthis near and dear, and this is"
588,00:40:06.60,00:40:06.60,a once-in-a-lifetime experienceI got to do twice.
589,00:40:12.27,00:40:12.27,">> Oh, Chet!>> My buddy."
590,00:40:16.07,00:40:16.07,">> You know, I have to say thechickens have not been the same"
591,00:40:19.27,00:40:19.27,since Chet left.>> My Survivor experience was
592,00:40:24.30,00:40:24.30,something I only dreamt ofhappening.
593,00:40:27.10,00:40:27.10,Even though I was told I wasgoing out first I went out
594,00:40:29.77,00:40:29.77,"seventh in a beautiful way, asfar as I'm concerned."
595,00:40:32.60,00:40:32.60,"Everybody who was praised fortheir strength, praised for"
596,00:40:35.77,00:40:35.77,"their agility, praised for theirathletic ability, I outlasted"
597,00:40:40.33,00:40:40.33,them.>> I loved Kathy.
598,00:40:44.23,00:40:44.23,>> She was...>> She was a colorful character.
599,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,">> Yeah, to say the least.>> I am in awe of every person"
600,00:40:54.70,00:40:54.70,who's ever played the game ofSurvivor.
601,00:40:58.10,00:40:58.10,It's the most difficult thingI've ever done.
602,00:41:01.47,00:41:01.47,"Childbirth, I thought that wastough."
603,00:41:03.80,00:41:03.80,Nah.I'd rather whip out eight more
604,00:41:06.03,00:41:06.03,kids in ten minutes than ever dothis again.
605,00:41:08.10,00:41:08.10,That's how much harderSurvivor is.
606,00:41:11.80,00:41:11.80,">> Oh, Tracy.>> She was... you know, I think"
607,00:41:17.30,00:41:17.30,she was underestimated in thisgame as a physical competitor.
608,00:41:19.90,00:41:19.90,">> Even if it's 20 days, 20 daysmay seem like not a lot of time"
609,00:41:24.63,00:41:24.63,"to a lot of people, but when therain is hitting you for nine and"
610,00:41:27.23,00:41:27.23,"a half hours, you just can't bethat same person any longer"
611,00:41:29.60,00:41:29.60,because you have just you andthe elements.
612,00:41:32.47,00:41:32.47,I am not the same person anylonger.
613,00:41:35.70,00:41:35.70,And I don't think I ever want tobe again.
614,00:41:47.40,00:41:47.40,">> Ami, Ami, Ami.>> You know, I loved Ami."
615,00:41:51.33,00:41:51.33,">> I did, too.Ami loved everyone."
616,00:41:54.80,00:41:54.80,">> This game, I was so much moresensitive than I was the first"
617,00:41:58.40,00:41:58.40,game.I've learned the balance for me
618,00:42:02.13,00:42:02.13,of vulnerability and strength.Of walking into a situation and
619,00:42:06.27,00:42:06.27,"being strong with who I am, andknowing that I don't need the"
620,00:42:08.93,00:42:08.93,feedback of other people to knowI'm okay with who I am.
621,00:42:15.37,00:42:15.37,">> Oh, Eliza.My arch rival that I had to"
622,00:42:19.43,00:42:19.43,compete with for 22 days.>> Wow.
623,00:42:23.00,00:42:23.00,>> Wow.>> Eliza put up a good fight in
624,00:42:24.73,00:42:24.73,"this game.>> Oh, yeah."
625,00:42:26.30,00:42:26.30,The last tribal council...>> She went down...
626,00:42:27.93,00:42:27.93,>> She went down swinging.>> ...in a blaze of glory.
627,00:42:29.70,00:42:29.70,">> Yes, she did.>> I was the underdog."
628,00:42:32.80,00:42:32.80,"I was on the outs almost fromthe start, because I didn't"
629,00:42:37.23,00:42:37.23,really have an alliance withanyone.
630,00:42:39.87,00:42:39.87,"And so I knew that I was on thebottom, and trying to work every"
631,00:42:43.17,00:42:43.17,"angle, which is my game, whichis the only game I know how to"
632,00:42:45.43,00:42:45.43,play.And I think I did a good job.
633,00:42:50.93,00:42:50.93,>> Ozzy!>> Ozzy!
634,00:42:52.87,00:42:52.87,">> Oh, Oz!>> I think he's the most well-"
635,00:42:55.03,00:42:55.03,rounded player ever in Survivor.>> And you like him.
636,00:42:59.87,00:42:59.87,>> That's why he had to go.>> You can carry his torch.
637,00:43:02.87,00:43:02.87,"I'll let you carry it.>> To a certain point, your time"
638,00:43:07.53,00:43:07.53,out in Survivor does define youto a large degree.
639,00:43:11.07,00:43:11.07,It's like a chance to reallysearch your soul and get to know
640,00:43:14.30,00:43:14.30,"who you are, and what you'remade of."
641,00:43:16.57,00:43:16.57,I knew that I had to trustpeople this time around to make
642,00:43:18.77,00:43:18.77,"it anywhere, and that was whatended up being my downfall."
643,00:43:23.50,00:43:23.50,But my relationship with Amandawas worth more to me than any
644,00:43:26.73,00:43:26.73,amount of money.>> Good old Jason.
645,00:43:32.87,00:43:32.87,">> He gave Ozzy a ride for hismoney, too."
646,00:43:36.20,00:43:36.20,>> He beat Ozzy twice.>> I came out here as a strong
647,00:43:42.17,00:43:42.17,"competitor and a good provider,and nobody really saw that"
648,00:43:46.97,00:43:46.97,because I think everybody wasjust focused on Ozzy.
649,00:43:49.57,00:43:49.57,So it's a bit comforting knowingthat Ozzy and I both went out in
650,00:43:53.03,00:43:53.03,the same way.It shows that I'm just as good
651,00:43:55.87,00:43:55.87,of a competitor and provider asOzzy.
652,00:44:04.17,00:44:04.17,">> Oh, James, my little cuddlebug."
653,00:44:06.63,00:44:06.63,">> He was honest.>> Yeah, he was a straight"
654,00:44:09.10,00:44:09.10,shooter.>> I'd much rather have been
655,00:44:11.30,00:44:11.30,"voted out, because it's like,closure."
656,00:44:14.60,00:44:14.60,"With a finger injury, it killsme."
657,00:44:18.30,00:44:18.30,But the trials I had to gothrough with them girls really
658,00:44:20.80,00:44:20.80,"was quite a test.I mean, I'm not a bully, but I"
659,00:44:23.07,00:44:23.07,surely don't like anybodytelling me what to do.
660,00:44:25.33,00:44:25.33,"So, I mean, I really had to letgo and go within myself to calm"
661,00:44:29.07,00:44:29.07,down.>> Alexis.
662,00:44:33.80,00:44:33.80,">> Alexis.>> You know, if, Alexis made it"
663,00:44:36.87,00:44:36.87,"this far, she would definitelybe hard to beat."
664,00:44:39.93,00:44:39.93,">> Yeah, Alexis was a charmer.>> Yes, definitely."
665,00:44:44.83,00:44:44.83,">> I felt like I always had thiskind of split between, like, the"
666,00:44:47.97,00:44:47.97,"super-competitive tomboy, butthen the super-nice southern"
667,00:44:50.43,00:44:50.43,"hospitality girl.So in a weird way, I feel like I"
668,00:44:53.63,00:44:53.63,came into this game a littlegirl and I got to grow up and
669,00:44:57.03,00:44:57.03,left a woman.>> Poor Erik.
670,00:45:01.73,00:45:01.73,I'm sorry he had to be thevictim of the women's wrath.
671,00:45:07.03,00:45:07.03,"But play with fire, you'll getburned."
672,00:45:10.40,00:45:10.40,>> I don't think you can playthis game without changing as a
673,00:45:14.50,00:45:14.50,"person.I mean, I've seen so much in so"
674,00:45:17.73,00:45:17.73,"few days that I've never, everseen in my life."
675,00:45:20.47,00:45:20.47,"I've seen these women here, andthey are vicious."
676,00:45:22.73,00:45:22.73,"I mean, they are cutthroat.They are very tough, and there's"
677,00:45:25.23,00:45:25.23,a lot of strength in them.And it's opened my eyes a little
678,00:45:27.80,00:45:27.80,bit about the way that women areand the way that they operate.
679,00:45:33.87,00:45:33.87,>> Natalie.>> Aww.
680,00:45:36.77,00:45:36.77,"The last fan in Survivor.>> Good on you, girl."
681,00:45:38.90,00:45:38.90,">> Good on you, baby.>> If the woman has the"
682,00:45:43.20,00:45:43.20,"opportunity to think, she willoutwit a man."
683,00:45:46.50,00:45:46.50,"They may outbrawn a woman, but awoman will definitely outwit a"
684,00:45:51.27,00:45:51.27,"man, hands down, every time.I think I learned a lot about"
685,00:45:54.30,00:45:54.30,"myself, and right now, I'm kindof my biggest fan."
686,00:47:10.20,00:47:10.20,>> JEFF: Welcome to your finalimmunity challenge.

748,00:51:58.93,00:51:58.93,decides it all.Here we go.
749,00:52:04.47,00:52:04.47,"Five, four, three, two... Ciriedrops."
750,00:52:08.77,00:52:08.77,"If it falls off while I'm stillcounting, we reset."
751,00:52:11.77,00:52:11.77,Take your time when you'relifting it up.
752,00:52:13.70,00:52:13.70,"It's not a race.Here we go, five, four, three,"
753,00:52:18.47,00:52:18.47,"two, one.Challenge is back on."
754,00:52:23.43,00:52:23.43,Amanda going underhand thistime.
755,00:52:27.77,00:52:27.77,Cirie sticking with the samegrip.
756,00:52:30.23,00:52:30.23,"Wherever you're holding it, donot move it."
757,00:52:33.07,00:52:33.07,Hold that ball steady if youwant a shot at a million bucks.
758,00:52:36.07,00:52:36.07,You have very little wiggleroom.
759,00:52:42.97,00:52:42.97,"30 more seconds, and you move onto the last round."
760,00:52:46.93,00:52:46.93,"Five, four, three, two, one.This round is over."
761,00:52:54.37,00:52:54.37,You're safe.Set it down.
762,00:52:56.87,00:52:56.87,All right.Last and final round.
763,00:53:02.37,00:53:02.37,Add the last two pieces.Pick up your handles.
764,00:53:08.63,00:53:08.63,This round will go untilsomebody drops their ball.
765,00:53:15.20,00:53:15.20,"Here we go.Five, four, three, two, one."
766,00:53:22.20,00:53:22.20,We are back on.This is the final round of this
767,00:53:25.80,00:53:25.80,challenge.Everything you have inside you
768,00:53:36.17,00:53:36.17,should be focused on keepingthat ball stable.
769,00:53:40.53,00:53:40.53,"The person left standing afterthis, immunity."
770,00:53:45.53,00:53:45.53,"Shot at a million bucks.You lose this challenge, your"
771,00:53:48.70,00:53:48.70,fate is not in your hands.Cirie loses her concentration.
772,00:54:02.13,00:54:02.13,Amanda wins final immunity andis guaranteed a spot at the
773,00:54:06.83,00:54:06.83,"final tribal council.>> Good job, babies."
774,00:54:12.43,00:54:12.43,You're awesome.>> Thank you.
775,00:54:14.87,00:54:14.87,>> Good job.You're awesome.
776,00:54:17.17,00:54:17.17,">> I love you guys.>> JEFF: Amanda, come on over."
777,00:54:22.63,00:54:22.63,No better time to have this thanright now.
778,00:54:28.23,00:54:28.23,">> Yep.>> JEFF: With this, you are"
779,00:54:31.40,00:54:31.40,guaranteed a spot at the finaltribal council.
780,00:54:34.00,00:54:34.00,You will get a chance toconvince the jury you are worthy
781,00:54:36.10,00:54:36.10,"of a million bucks.At tonight's tribal council, you"
782,00:54:38.57,00:54:38.57,"will cast a vote, and in doingso, you will vote either Parvati"
783,00:54:41.57,00:54:41.57,or Cirie out of the game.The other person you're going to
784,00:54:44.43,00:54:44.43,take with you to the finaltribal.
785,00:54:46.53,00:54:46.53,"Big, big decision.Have a fun afternoon."
786,00:54:49.07,00:54:49.07,Head back to camp.I will see you guys at tribal.
787,00:55:10.87,00:55:10.87,">> Oh, Gloria.>> She likes it here."
788,00:55:16.40,00:55:16.40,She likes the coop.>> Yeah.
789,00:55:23.47,00:55:23.47,"We just got back from the lastimmunity challenge, and I won"
790,00:55:26.70,00:55:26.70,immunity.So I'm going to the final two.
791,00:55:29.47,00:55:29.47,And it's either Parvati or Ciriegoing home tonight.
792,00:55:33.63,00:55:33.63,"Honestly, this is the hardestdecision I've had to make this"
793,00:55:36.63,00:55:36.63,"whole game, because, you know,we're each close."
794,00:55:39.57,00:55:39.57,All of us are close.So who do you send home?
795,00:55:42.40,00:55:42.40,>> I don't know what happened.I must have blinked.
796,00:55:46.33,00:55:46.33,>> And it just fell?>> Mm-hmm.
797,00:55:53.10,00:55:53.10,">> She's a closer, that one, youknow?"
798,00:55:55.80,00:55:55.80,>> I thought for sure that Icould win this one.
799,00:56:00.60,00:56:00.60,"Because during surgeries, youhave to hold, like, retractors"
800,00:56:05.37,00:56:05.37,"or instrumentation, and youcan't really move."
801,00:56:09.03,00:56:09.03,"If you move, somebody might gethurt."
802,00:56:11.77,00:56:11.77,"Unfortunately, Amanda won.And since Parv and Amanda are so"
803,00:56:15.50,00:56:15.50,"buddy-buddy, unless somethinghappens, I'm probably going home"
804,00:56:18.77,00:56:18.77,"tonight.>> This is my decision, pretty"
805,00:56:32.10,00:56:32.10,much.>> I know.
806,00:56:34.13,00:56:34.13,"We're not even voting, I don'tthink."
807,00:56:35.93,00:56:35.93,">> No, I am.Me."
808,00:56:37.63,00:56:37.63,>> Yeah.>> That sucks.
809,00:56:39.40,00:56:39.40,">> I know.I mean, she understands."
810,00:56:46.70,00:56:46.70,My fate is pretty much inAmanda's hands right now.
811,00:56:49.53,00:56:49.53,But I'm fairly confident thatshe's going to take me to the
812,00:56:52.73,00:56:52.73,final two with her.We've had an alliance since day
813,00:56:55.23,00:56:55.23,one out here.And we also have a really tight
814,00:56:58.47,00:56:58.47,"relationship, Amanda and I,that's developed over the course"
815,00:57:00.73,00:57:00.73,"of this game.So I'm not worried about it,"
816,00:57:03.23,00:57:03.23,"really.This is good, because then"
817,00:57:05.63,00:57:05.63,"tomorrow we can just help eachother with our opening speeches,"
818,00:57:07.73,00:57:07.73,just question each other andhang out.
819,00:57:09.67,00:57:09.67,"Oh, today was awful, though.>> Well, you've been handling"
820,00:57:17.70,00:57:17.70,"all these situations reallygracefully, you know."
821,00:57:19.80,00:57:19.80,">> Well, I already knew, like,if I didn't win that she'd take"
822,00:57:23.30,00:57:23.30,"you, so it's not like...>> She pissed way more people"
823,00:57:28.17,00:57:28.17,"off than I did.>> Yeah, actually, huh?"
824,00:57:31.47,00:57:31.47,>> Yeah.>> This is such a nightmare that
825,00:57:45.90,00:57:45.90,this happened today.I can't even believe that... how
826,00:57:49.70,00:57:49.70,do I make the decision?What do I go by?
827,00:57:53.10,00:57:53.10,">> I don't know.>> It's, like, the hardest thing"
828,00:57:56.00,00:57:56.00,I've ever had to do.>> Yeah.
829,00:57:59.20,00:57:59.20,>> Parvati and Cirie bothdeserve to be here.
830,00:58:01.50,00:58:01.50,They both want to be here.So I honestly don't know what to
831,00:58:04.23,00:58:04.23,do.I have a really good personal
832,00:58:06.83,00:58:06.83,"relationship with Parvati, so Ifeel more loyal to Parvati."
833,00:58:10.70,00:58:10.70,>> I feel like your best shotwith the jury is taking me over
834,00:58:15.60,00:58:15.60,"Parv.Every person she screwed over, I"
835,00:58:18.53,00:58:18.53,screwed over.We did everything together.
836,00:58:21.17,00:58:21.17,Every blindside we orchestratedtogether.
837,00:58:24.83,00:58:24.83,Most of them I did most of thetalking for.
838,00:58:29.93,00:58:29.93,">> So how is...>> Yeah, but that's only if the"
839,00:58:38.03,00:58:38.03,people are willing to listen.These are the people I screwed
840,00:58:41.60,00:58:41.60,over I would have to talk to.>> Cirie has pissed a lot of
841,00:58:45.23,00:58:45.23,people off on the jury.Probably more than Parvati.
842,00:58:48.90,00:58:48.90,But Cirie is a hell of aspeaker.
843,00:58:51.90,00:58:51.90,She can convince anyone to doanything.
844,00:58:55.07,00:58:55.07,"And in the final tribal council,she could convince the jury to"
845,00:58:57.87,00:58:57.87,"give her the million dollars.So, I mean, it's kind of a"
846,00:59:00.87,00:59:00.87,catch-22.>> It should be interesting.
847,00:59:09.60,00:59:09.60,>> Making this decision tonightis killing me.
848,00:59:12.03,00:59:12.03,"You kind of have to just go withhow you feel, and a gut feeling."
849,00:59:14.50,00:59:14.50,"And I've been going with my gutthis whole game, and it's gotten"
850,00:59:16.87,00:59:16.87,"me this far, but I know thatthis decision could cost me the"
851,00:59:19.33,00:59:19.33,million dollars.>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the
852,00:59:41.60,00:59:41.60,"members of our jury.Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,"
853,00:59:48.17,00:59:48.17,"Alexis, Erik, and Natalie, votedout at the last tribal council."
854,00:59:56.00,00:59:56.00,"Well, after 38 days, we'vereached a point where there is"
855,01:00:00.73,01:00:00.73,only one decision left to bemade before we turn this game
856,01:00:04.37,01:00:04.37,"over to the jury.And that is, who's going to that"
857,01:00:07.80,01:00:07.80,"final tribal council?Amanda, after winning today's"
858,01:00:10.70,01:00:10.70,"immunity challenge, you are intotal control."
859,01:00:13.90,01:00:13.90,">> I know.>> JEFF: Tough decision, in a"
860,01:00:16.37,01:00:16.37,way.You guys have been together
861,01:00:18.50,01:00:18.50,almost from the beginning.>> Yeah.
862,01:00:21.23,01:00:21.23,"I mean, winning immunity todaywas a blessing and a curse at"
863,01:00:24.20,01:00:24.20,"the same time.You know, it's a blessing"
864,01:00:27.43,01:00:27.43,"because I'm guaranteed the finaltwo, and it's a curse because I"
865,01:00:31.33,01:00:31.33,"have to choose who goes with me.And we're so close, it's..."
866,01:00:36.67,01:00:36.67,"It's just a hard, hard decision.>> JEFF: Cirie, do you buy that"
867,01:00:43.00,01:00:43.00,it's difficult for Amanda?>> Yeah.
868,01:00:46.63,01:00:46.63,"I believe it's difficult forAmanda, because we have been"
869,01:00:49.97,01:00:49.97,"together since day one.Amanda, Parvati, and myself, we"
870,01:00:53.23,01:00:53.23,"kind of decided, you know, itshould be us three 'til the end."
871,01:00:56.90,01:00:56.90,And it pretty much has beenthat.
872,01:01:00.80,01:01:00.80,">> JEFF: Parvati, difficult tonot have any say at this point?"
873,01:01:04.27,01:01:04.27,>> I honestly don't envyAmanda's position at all right
874,01:01:08.40,01:01:08.40,"now.I mean, she has a hard decision"
875,01:01:10.97,01:01:10.97,to make.We have all been protecting each
876,01:01:13.80,01:01:13.80,"other through blindside afterblindside, weathering storms"
877,01:01:16.30,01:01:16.30,"together, and I don't think itis going to be an easy decision,"
878,01:01:19.70,01:01:19.70,and I wouldn't want to be makingit.
879,01:01:21.97,01:01:21.97,">> JEFF: So Amanda, take methrough both sides of this."
880,01:01:24.27,01:01:24.27,What about bringing Parvati orCirie to the end is risky?
881,01:01:28.43,01:01:28.43,">> You know, with these girlsit's a tossup at this point."
882,01:01:32.40,01:01:32.40,"Strategy-wise, Cirie is a greattalker."
883,01:01:36.07,01:01:36.07,She can convince pretty muchanyone to do anything.
884,01:01:39.30,01:01:39.30,"And, you know, that's a threatat the end of the game."
885,01:01:43.47,01:01:43.47,And Parvati has played a verysocial game.
886,01:01:46.80,01:01:46.80,She has made personalrelationships on the jury that I
887,01:01:49.33,01:01:49.33,think will definitely come intoplay at the final tribal
888,01:01:51.97,01:01:51.97,"council.So it was a hard decision, but I"
889,01:01:55.00,01:01:55.00,ultimately made a decision on mygut feeling.
890,01:01:58.50,01:01:58.50,>> JEFF: Take me through themixed emotions that have to be

895,01:02:18.10,01:02:18.10,">> That's okay.>> It's just really hard for me,"
896,01:02:24.63,01:02:24.63,"because I feel like either way,it's a lose-lose situation for"
897,01:02:28.93,01:02:28.93,"me at this point.I mean, if I go with Cirie, I'm"
898,01:02:31.33,01:02:31.33,"hurts Parvati.If I go with Parvati, I'm"
899,01:02:33.70,01:02:33.70,hurting Cirie.I know that this vote tonight is
900,01:02:36.80,01:02:36.80,going to hurt someone'sfeelings.
901,01:02:38.97,01:02:38.97,And I'm just having a hard timewith that.

903,01:02:47.53,01:02:47.53,"Amanda, since you have immunity,nobody can vote for you."
904,01:02:50.80,01:02:50.80,That means Cirie can only votefor Parvati.
905,01:02:54.00,01:02:54.00,"Parvati can only vote for Cirie.Parvati and Cirie, you won't"
906,01:02:57.77,01:02:57.77,vote tonight.The only person voting tonight

936,01:06:21.67,01:06:21.67,I can't believe we did this.>> I can't believe we're the
937,01:06:25.90,01:06:25.90,last two.>> I know.
938,01:06:27.87,01:06:27.87,Everyone's gone but me and you.>> I know.
939,01:06:30.57,01:06:30.57,>> We bamboozled everyone out ofthe game.
940,01:06:33.73,01:06:33.73,">> This morning when I woke up,I think the happiness, like,"
941,01:06:36.50,01:06:36.50,"started in my stomach, and itbubbled up, and I couldn't wipe"
942,01:06:38.93,01:06:38.93,the smile off my face.All the hard work has paid off.
943,01:06:41.43,01:06:41.43,"We're here, and it's done, andwe're final two."
944,01:06:51.67,01:06:51.67,">> Oh, my god!>> BOTH: Oh..."
945,01:06:54.53,01:06:54.53,my...God.
946,01:06:57.13,01:06:57.13,>> Amanda and I pretty much ownthis game.
947,01:06:59.30,01:06:59.30,She made it all the way to theend in China.
948,01:07:01.57,01:07:01.57,I made it almost all the way tothe end in the Cooks.
949,01:07:05.30,01:07:05.30,"To be in the final two in thisseason, it's a serious"
950,01:07:07.63,01:07:07.63,"accomplishment, and I feel likeI can stand up tall and be like,"
951,01:07:11.13,01:07:11.13,"""I am a survivor.""Oh, my god."
952,01:07:14.20,01:07:14.20,"I am so glad I'm with you.>> I know, me, too!"
953,01:07:16.97,01:07:16.97,There's no other person here I'drather be here with right now.
954,01:07:19.57,01:07:19.57,">> Me, either.This is, like, the prettiest"
955,01:07:22.37,01:07:22.37,"picnic ever.>> This is, like, a huge"
956,01:07:24.57,01:07:24.57,"accomplishment.Like, this is the biggest"
957,01:07:26.80,01:07:26.80,"accomplishment of my life.>> Mine, too."
958,01:07:28.83,01:07:28.83,>> I feel like we battled everyelement to get where we are
959,01:07:31.27,01:07:31.27,"right now-- like, every possiblething that we could go through,"
960,01:07:35.57,01:07:35.57,"we've gone through, and we've,like, mastered it, and we've"
961,01:07:38.47,01:07:38.47,"gotten ourselves here.In the past six months, I've"
962,01:07:41.70,01:07:41.70,"been living in the jungle for 78days, you know, so I don't think"
963,01:07:45.83,01:07:45.83,there's much in real life that Ican't handle after
964,01:07:49.07,01:07:49.07,two Survivors in a row.>> We're going to be so good
965,01:07:51.80,01:07:51.80,"tonight at that tribal thing.>> Oh, yeah, we're going to be,"
966,01:07:54.03,01:07:54.03,"like, happy and full and belike, ""Yeah, ask us your"
967,01:07:56.43,01:07:56.43,"questions.Bring it on."""
968,01:07:59.87,01:07:59.87,">> ""Bring it on, bitches."">> I think it's interesting that"
969,01:08:03.40,01:08:03.40,"me and Parvati are in the end ofthis game together, because we"
970,01:08:05.73,01:08:05.73,have played completely differentgames.
971,01:08:08.03,01:08:08.03,"I think I have played this gameloyal to my alliances, and"
972,01:08:10.67,01:08:10.67,Parvati pretty much did anythingshe needed to do to take
973,01:08:13.57,01:08:13.57,"control.And because of that, a lot of"
974,01:08:17.83,01:08:17.83,"people on the jury don't likeher, so that could be a benefit"
975,01:08:20.63,01:08:20.63,for me.>> We have had this game in the
976,01:08:23.73,01:08:23.73,palm of our hands since we met.And then the switch-up.
977,01:08:27.60,01:08:27.60,"And then the craziness.And then, still, it's still you"
978,01:08:31.13,01:08:31.13,"and me.I really, honestly, feel so"
979,01:08:35.73,01:08:35.73,relaxed going into the finaltribal council.
980,01:08:42.37,01:08:42.37,I feel like I've played a gamethat's been very true to myself.
981,01:08:45.00,01:08:45.00,I don't feel like I could haveplayed this game better.
982,01:08:47.57,01:08:47.57,>> You want to do the honors?>> Sure.
983,01:08:53.03,01:08:53.03,>> Ah-hah!My game was a lot more
984,01:09:00.47,01:09:00.47,"aggressive than Amanda's game.It was a lot more cutthroat,"
985,01:09:02.73,01:09:02.73,more cold-blooded.I was playing this to win.
986,01:09:08.87,01:09:08.87,>> We're pyromaniacs.>> That's awesome.
987,01:09:13.23,01:09:13.23,I think my strongest point I canmake tonight is standing up and
988,01:09:16.50,01:09:16.50,"owning that I have been apowerful, controlling player"
989,01:09:19.67,01:09:19.67,throughout the duration of thisgame.
990,01:09:36.27,01:09:36.27,">> Parvati has played acutthroat, aggressive game, and"

992,01:09:42.40,01:09:42.40,"aggressive game, and that couldbe by her throwing me under the"
993,01:09:45.07,01:09:45.07,"bus tonight at tribal.And if that is the case, then I"
994,01:09:48.03,01:09:48.03,am ready to fight for this.I think people will give me
995,01:09:57.70,01:09:57.70,"their votes, because I was loyalto every alliance that I've"
996,01:10:00.00,01:10:00.00,"made.Yeah, the jury makes the"
997,01:10:02.30,01:10:02.30,"decision, but ultimately, it'sme and Parvati convincing the"
998,01:10:04.73,01:10:04.73,"jury what to do.Tonight we're going toe to toe,"
999,01:10:08.20,01:10:08.20,"and one person is going to win amillion dollars, and the other"
1000,01:10:10.10,01:10:10.10,"person is going to walk awaywith nothing, and may the best"
1001,01:10:11.87,01:10:11.87,woman win.>> JEFF: We'll now bring in the

1007,01:11:02.00,01:11:02.00,this side of the tribal councilover to the jury.
1008,01:11:06.27,01:11:06.27,Based on what they've seen overthe last 39 days and what they
1009,01:11:09.90,01:11:09.90,"hear tonight, the jury will makea million-dollar decision."
1010,01:11:14.67,01:11:14.67,Here's how it's going to work.You will each get a chance to
1011,01:11:17.53,01:11:17.53,make an opening statement.This is your first chance to
1012,01:11:19.93,01:11:19.93,convince this jury why you aredeserving of the title of sole
1013,01:11:22.67,01:11:22.67,survivor.The jury will then get their
1014,01:11:25.70,01:11:25.70,first chance to address you.We will then vote.
1015,01:11:32.57,01:11:32.57,"Opening statements.Amanda, you're up."
1016,01:11:40.07,01:11:40.07,">> I came into this game, youknow, wanting to do two things."
1017,01:11:42.77,01:11:42.77,"I wanted to play a loyal game,and I wanted to fight"
1018,01:11:46.03,01:11:46.03,"physically, strategically, andmentally to the end."
1019,01:11:48.80,01:11:48.80,"And, you know, I'm really proudof how I played."
1020,01:11:52.03,01:11:52.03,"And I know I wouldn't be sittinghere without, you know, help"
1021,01:11:55.00,01:11:55.00,from all of you.So thanks.
1022,01:11:58.43,01:11:58.43,I wanted to say thanks.>> JEFF: Parvati.
1023,01:12:03.53,01:12:03.53,>> I came into this game with aprevious reputation from the
1024,01:12:08.60,01:12:08.60,Cook Islands as the flirt.I knew that I had to play so
1025,01:12:13.53,01:12:13.53,much differently than I playedin the Cook Islands.
1026,01:12:15.70,01:12:15.70,"Like, I had to playaggressively."
1027,01:12:17.83,01:12:17.83,I had to beat my competitionbefore my competition had a
1028,01:12:20.37,01:12:20.37,chance to beat me.And you gave me a serious run
1029,01:12:23.40,01:12:23.40,"for my money, all of you.So the only thing I could do was"
1030,01:12:31.30,01:12:31.30,"make bold power plays, and withthe help of a powerful group of"
1031,01:12:35.37,01:12:35.37,"women, pull off some of thehugest heists in Survivor"
1032,01:12:38.97,01:12:38.97,"history.So ask me anything you want, and"
1033,01:12:43.13,01:12:43.13,"you'll get an honest answer.>> JEFF: All right, jury, in a"
1034,01:12:45.47,01:12:45.47,moment you're going to get yourfirst chance to address Amanda
1035,01:12:47.80,01:12:47.80,and Parvati.I'll give you a moment to think
1036,01:12:50.07,01:12:50.07,"about what you want to say.>> JEFF: All right, jury, it is"
1037,01:13:08.73,01:13:08.73,"now your first opportunity toaddress Amanda and Parvati,"
1038,01:13:13.53,01:13:13.53,trying to gain the informationyou need to make a million-
1039,01:13:15.77,01:13:15.77,"dollar decision.Eliza, get us started."
1040,01:13:24.57,01:13:24.57,>> Both of you played a greatstrategic game.
1041,01:13:26.60,01:13:26.60,"You made moves, and I canrespect that."
1042,01:13:29.03,01:13:29.03,But I honestly have no idea whoI'm going to vote for tonight.
1043,01:13:32.23,01:13:32.23,"Parvati, all 24 days I spent inthis game I spent on the island"
1044,01:13:37.37,01:13:37.37,with you.I think taking out Ozzy was a
1045,01:13:40.30,01:13:40.30,brilliant strategic move.I respect that move that you
1046,01:13:44.17,01:13:44.17,"made.What I can't respect, however,"
1047,01:13:47.90,01:13:47.90,is everything you did that wasnot necessary for strategic
1048,01:13:51.23,01:13:51.23,advancement in this game.You talked about me behind my
1049,01:13:53.73,01:13:53.73,back.You made fun of me.
1050,01:13:55.77,01:13:55.77,And that is not what got you tothe final two.
1051,01:13:58.13,01:13:58.13,It leads me to believe that youmight just be a mean person.
1052,01:14:00.53,01:14:00.53,So I'm going to have a lot ofdifficulty giving you my vote
1053,01:14:02.67,01:14:02.67,"tonight.Amanda, you played a great"
1054,01:14:05.50,01:14:05.50,"strategic game, and it was veryimpressive."
1055,01:14:09.27,01:14:09.27,"However, listening to you talkliterally made me want to kill"
1056,01:14:13.00,01:14:13.00,myself sometimes.I don't know that I can vote for
1057,01:14:15.67,01:14:15.67,someone who I think is sosuperficial.
1058,01:14:18.73,01:14:18.73,And I'm going to be sittingright there tonight listening to
1059,01:14:21.30,01:14:21.30,"every single thing you both say,because my vote is absolutely"
1060,01:14:24.43,01:14:24.43,not determined.So I hope that I can see some
1061,01:14:26.70,01:14:26.70,genuineness and honesty from youtwo tonight.
1062,01:14:29.60,01:14:29.60,">> JEFF: Thanks, Eliza.Jason, you're up."
1063,01:14:39.07,01:14:39.07,">> Amanda, when Ozzy was votedout, if you were let in on that"
1064,01:14:43.33,01:14:43.33,"plan, would you have told Ozzy?>> Yes."
1065,01:14:48.57,01:14:48.57,">> And Parv, I've had thesemisconceptions of you as a"
1066,01:14:55.23,01:14:55.23,"devious, manipulative player.And I just want to know what"
1067,01:14:58.27,01:14:58.27,some of your redeeming qualitieshave been in the game.
1068,01:15:02.47,01:15:02.47,">> Okay.Well, I think for one, I was"
1069,01:15:06.67,01:15:06.67,"very protective of my alliancewith Cirie and Amanda, gave them"
1070,01:15:12.03,01:15:12.03,"my loyalty, and was loyal tothem all the way to the end."
1071,01:15:15.50,01:15:15.50,So protectiveness and loyalty tothe ladies that I gave my
1072,01:15:21.37,01:15:21.37,loyalty to.We didn't kill Gloria the
1073,01:15:25.03,01:15:25.03,chicken.We saved her life.
1074,01:15:27.80,01:15:27.80,So I'm an animal lover.Is that good enough?
1075,01:15:30.53,01:15:30.53,>> Okay.>> JEFF: Satisfied?
1076,01:15:32.53,01:15:32.53,>> Yeah.Good luck to the both of you.
1077,01:15:34.63,01:15:34.63,">> JEFF: Alexis, you're up.>> My first question is for"
1078,01:15:41.50,01:15:41.50,"Parv.And, obviously, one of the"
1079,01:15:44.77,01:15:44.77,"biggest, most important thingsto me is how passionate I am"
1080,01:15:47.40,01:15:47.40,about working with young girls.I guess I'm just really curious
1081,01:15:51.07,01:15:51.07,what makes you a better rolemodel than Amanda for young
1082,01:15:54.40,01:15:54.40,girls.>> I don't know if it's better
1083,01:15:57.27,01:15:57.27,or worse.I'm more outspoken than Amanda.
1084,01:15:59.63,01:15:59.63,So I think I'm more independent.I don't like things to be done
1085,01:16:02.60,01:16:02.60,for me.Amanda would go along with the
1086,01:16:05.27,01:16:05.27,"flow, and for me, I think I'mmore willing to put myself out"
1087,01:16:08.97,01:16:08.97,there and make bold moves.And I didn't see much of that
1088,01:16:13.03,01:16:13.03,from Amanda.So I guess that's why I feel
1089,01:16:16.30,01:16:16.30,like I would make a better rolemodel.
1090,01:16:18.53,01:16:18.53,">> Thank you.Amanda, I have seen a bunch of"
1091,01:16:21.30,01:16:21.30,Oscar award-winning performancesand we couldn't help but be
1092,01:16:27.07,01:16:27.07,laughing when you were cryingabout sending Cirie home.
1093,01:16:30.50,01:16:30.50,It's not that I'm notsympathetic to it.
1094,01:16:32.53,01:16:32.53,"It's just I think, you know, youcry wolf so many times that,"
1095,01:16:34.43,01:16:34.43,"like, what about, if any, partof your game has been genuine?"
1096,01:16:38.83,01:16:38.83,>> I haven't been fakinganything that I've done at
1097,01:16:41.03,01:16:41.03,"tribal.The tears... like, I've only"
1098,01:16:43.50,01:16:43.50,"cried the last tribal council,and that was genuine."
1099,01:16:46.33,01:16:46.33,"Like, that was the hardestdecision I've ever had to make."
1100,01:16:48.97,01:16:48.97,I didn't come here trying to getsympathy votes.
1101,01:16:51.57,01:16:51.57,I don't want sympathy votes.>> JEFF: Do you have what you
1102,01:16:54.43,01:16:54.43,need?>> Mm-hmm.
1103,01:16:56.43,01:16:56.43,">> JEFF: Okay.Natalie, you're up."
1104,01:17:06.50,01:17:06.50,">> Ladies.First of all, you have my"

1106,01:17:14.57,01:17:14.57,You have labeled yourself as aflirt.
1107,01:17:17.80,01:17:17.80,You're probably the mostmasterful person in the history
1108,01:17:21.30,01:17:21.30,"of Survivor to play the flirtcard, which is great."
1109,01:17:23.83,01:17:23.83,My question to you is how doesthat resonate for you in the
1110,01:17:28.43,01:17:28.43,bedroom?How do you take that to the next
1111,01:17:32.10,01:17:32.10,level as far as strategy in thegame?
1112,01:17:34.97,01:17:34.97,How does that translate yourlayers of being?
1113,01:17:40.23,01:17:40.23,">> JEFF: Come on, guys.Parvati, do you know what she's"
1114,01:17:42.20,01:17:42.20,asking?>> You're a flirt.
1115,01:17:45.90,01:17:45.90,You flirted with me on severaloccasions.
1116,01:17:48.23,01:17:48.23,I'm not complaining.>> You're sexy.
1117,01:17:50.43,01:17:50.43,>> Thanks.So how does being the flirt
1118,01:17:54.03,01:17:54.03,parallel to your intimate life?>> I think my strategy in this
1119,01:17:59.80,01:17:59.80,"game has been infused with mypersonality, and being"
1120,01:18:04.03,01:18:04.03,flirtatious is a big part of mypersonality.
1121,01:18:06.70,01:18:06.70,"At home, it gets me what I want.I'll flirt with girls to get my"
1122,01:18:14.43,01:18:14.43,"way, or I'll flirt with guys toget my way."
1123,01:18:17.13,01:18:17.13,And I think I honestly candevelop genuine relationships
1124,01:18:20.80,01:18:20.80,with people without flirtingwith them.
1125,01:18:23.07,01:18:23.07,"But it is an old standby, I'mnot going to lie."
1126,01:18:25.67,01:18:25.67,">> Okay.Amanda, clearly, you're a"
1127,01:18:29.10,01:18:29.10,beautiful woman.You appear to be a very strong
1128,01:18:32.10,01:18:32.10,"woman.Unfortunately, you always had,"
1129,01:18:36.20,01:18:36.20,"like, a glazed-over look on yourface."
1130,01:18:38.60,01:18:38.60,I did notice that.My question to you is was that
1131,01:18:41.40,01:18:41.40,"your strategy to kind of playthe zombied pretty girl, not"
1132,01:18:46.33,01:18:46.33,"really knowing what's going on,pageant queen cliche, or is this"
1133,01:18:51.13,01:18:51.13,"who you are as a person?>> No, it's neither."
1134,01:18:55.57,01:18:55.57,"It was neither my strategy, nordo I think that's who I am as a"
1135,01:18:58.37,01:18:58.37,person.I'm a strong woman.
1136,01:19:01.10,01:19:01.10,"I definitely have substance.Sometimes I'm a little reserved,"
1137,01:19:04.03,01:19:04.03,but I definitely think I've madeintellectual strategic
1138,01:19:06.87,01:19:06.87,"decisions.And, you know, I want to compete"
1139,01:19:09.43,01:19:09.43,"with the men.Like, I came in this game to"
1140,01:19:11.80,01:19:11.80,compete with the guys.And I don't want anything given
1141,01:19:14.00,01:19:14.00,to me.I came in here to earn
1142,01:19:15.87,01:19:15.87,"everything.>> Okay, thank you both for your"
1143,01:19:17.73,01:19:17.73,"answers.>> JEFF: Thanks, Natalie."
1144,01:19:19.77,01:19:19.77,"Erik, you're up.>> Hi, girls."
1145,01:19:30.87,01:19:30.87,"Let me just start by saying fiveto six days ago, I would have"
1146,01:19:34.33,01:19:34.33,been 100% voting for Amanda inthis situation.
1147,01:19:37.40,01:19:37.40,"I mean, I really respected you,Amanda."
1148,01:19:40.97,01:19:40.97,"And I really thought of you kindof as a big sister, or a cousin."
1149,01:19:45.03,01:19:45.03,"As of late, after seeing certainthings, I mean, I'm looking at"
1150,01:19:47.93,01:19:47.93,you right now with a lot ofquestions.
1151,01:19:51.23,01:19:51.23,"I felt totally burned, totallythrown under the bus at the past"
1152,01:19:54.90,01:19:54.90,two tribal councils that I wasthere.
1153,01:19:57.77,01:19:57.77,"You pretty much ripped me apart.I mean, on what basis did you"
1154,01:20:01.40,01:20:01.40,"have to just judge me in frontof everybody, in front of this"
1155,01:20:03.57,01:20:03.57,jury?>> Okay.
1156,01:20:05.20,01:20:05.20,>> I just want to know that.I really want to know that.
1157,01:20:07.03,01:20:07.03,">> You know, everything I saidin tribal council was honest."
1158,01:20:09.40,01:20:09.40,"You were unloyal to me, and youtried to get me voted out, and I"
1159,01:20:11.70,01:20:11.70,was hurt.I wasn't going to sit there and
1160,01:20:14.47,01:20:14.47,let you try to vote me out andjust keep my mouth shut.
1161,01:20:17.90,01:20:17.90,"I'm sorry, if I hurt yourfeelings, but..."
1162,01:20:20.40,01:20:20.40,">> Too late for ""I'm sorries.""I've heard you say that... you"
1163,01:20:23.47,01:20:23.47,said that directly to me at oneof the tribal councils.
1164,01:20:25.70,01:20:25.70,"Too little, too late.You said that directly to me."
1165,01:20:28.37,01:20:28.37,"And now you're going to say ""I'msorry"" to me."
1166,01:20:30.90,01:20:30.90,I really don't buy that at all.>> Okay.
1167,01:20:34.23,01:20:34.23,>> I think I'm good.>> JEFF: Okay.
1168,01:20:39.87,01:20:39.87,James.How's the finger?
1169,01:20:45.17,01:20:45.17,>> The finger's all right.It's good.
1170,01:20:48.10,01:20:48.10,"I mean, I'm not even going to bedifficult."
1171,01:20:51.40,01:20:51.40,Amanda pretty much knows she'sgot it in the bag.
1172,01:20:54.50,01:20:54.50,"The only thing is, Parvati, youfluffed me."
1173,01:20:57.80,01:20:57.80,"You did the great move withOzzy, and the next day you came"
1174,01:21:00.13,01:21:00.13,up to me with a bunch of fluff.So we're just going to pretend
1175,01:21:03.23,01:21:03.23,"like you didn't say that, have ago again, we reenact it, you"
1176,01:21:06.07,01:21:06.07,"give me a different version.Go on, give it to me, and make"
1177,01:21:09.03,01:21:09.03,"it believable.>> Ha, ha, got you, sucker."
1178,01:21:11.47,01:21:11.47,What?>> That's not it.
1179,01:21:14.30,01:21:14.30,Try a little bit harder.>> That is what you wanted me to
1180,01:21:16.03,01:21:16.03,"say.>> No, that's not what I wanted."
1181,01:21:17.60,01:21:17.60,>> That's exactly what you saidyou wanted me to say.
1182,01:21:19.33,01:21:19.33,">> You're over-exaggerating it.What I wanted, you to just be"
1183,01:21:21.17,01:21:21.17,"honest.""Hey, I'm playing the game."
1184,01:21:22.87,01:21:22.87,"It's a game.""I mean, when I play the game..."
1185,01:21:24.60,01:21:24.60,>> It is a game.And the game... the motto is
1186,01:21:27.10,01:21:27.10,"""Outplay, outwit, outlast."">> Exactly."
1187,01:21:29.47,01:21:29.47,>> There was no chance for me towin this game if I stuck with
1188,01:21:32.03,01:21:32.03,"you, and if I stuck with Oz.There was no chance of me"
1189,01:21:35.43,01:21:35.43,sitting here if I stuck with youguys.
1190,01:21:37.67,01:21:37.67,And that's what I felt.I felt like I had to make that
1191,01:21:39.90,01:21:39.90,"move when I made it.It also, you know, gave me a lot"
1192,01:21:42.57,01:21:42.57,of control.And that's what I wanted.
1193,01:21:46.23,01:21:46.23,>> Are you finished?>> Yes.
1194,01:21:49.40,01:21:49.40,">> All right.>> JEFF: Cirie, you're up."
1195,01:21:54.10,01:21:54.10,>> All righty.Congratulations to both of you.
1196,01:22:00.90,01:22:00.90,"I'm going to start with you,Amanda."
1197,01:22:03.93,01:22:03.93,"Being that you had the decisionto make, tell me and the jury"
1198,01:22:07.70,01:22:07.70,why Parvati deserves a milliondollars more than I do.
1199,01:22:12.87,01:22:12.87,">> Parvati played a veryaggressive, bold game."
1200,01:22:17.87,01:22:17.87,"I think she's stood by her gamethe whole time, and I respect"
1201,01:22:22.17,01:22:22.17,"that about her.>> So in saying that, are you"
1202,01:22:24.83,01:22:24.83,saying you don't respect mygame?
1203,01:22:26.87,01:22:26.87,">> No, I respect your game aswell."
1204,01:22:28.83,01:22:28.83,I think Parvati made bolderdecisions in this game.
1205,01:22:32.13,01:22:32.13,>> Than I did?>> Yes.
1206,01:22:34.37,01:22:34.37,And I think she was kind of thepowerhouse in making those
1207,01:22:38.30,01:22:38.30,decisions happen.>> Okay.
1208,01:22:41.00,01:22:41.00,"Parvati, I would like you totell the jury why I should be"
1209,01:22:48.43,01:22:48.43,"sitting in your seat, and you beover here on the jury."
1210,01:22:51.53,01:22:51.53,>> I think you played a prettybrilliant game.
1211,01:22:54.60,01:22:54.60,"Yours was a little more, youknow, under the radar than mine"
1212,01:22:58.63,01:22:58.63,"was, which I think is a greatstrategy, you know, to get up"
1213,01:23:00.83,01:23:00.83,"here, too.But I can't compete with a"
1214,01:23:03.17,01:23:03.17,mother of three.You have kids.
1215,01:23:05.47,01:23:05.47,You have a family.I don't have that.
1216,01:23:07.97,01:23:07.97,"So based on those two factors, Iwould say it should have been"
1217,01:23:12.67,01:23:12.67,you right here.Is that good?
1218,01:23:14.73,01:23:14.73,Is that good enough?No?
1219,01:23:16.87,01:23:16.87,>> I'll ponder over here.>> Okay.
1220,01:23:19.47,01:23:19.47,">> Thanks, ladies.Good luck."
1221,01:23:21.47,01:23:21.47,">> Thanks.>> JEFF: Thanks, Cirie."
1222,01:23:24.97,01:23:24.97,"Ozzy, you're up.>> I think I might be the"
1223,01:23:35.83,01:23:35.83,biggest idiot up here.I am truly to the bottom of my
1224,01:23:40.83,01:23:40.83,heart hurt by what you did tome.
1225,01:23:43.77,01:23:43.77,It was a great move.It really was.
1226,01:23:46.77,01:23:46.77,But I never in a million yearsthought that you could do that
1227,01:23:51.03,01:23:51.03,to me.You put a price on our
1228,01:23:53.73,01:23:53.73,friendship.You threw us away like garbage.
1229,01:23:58.83,01:23:58.83,"You basically said, ""You knowwhat?"
1230,01:24:01.57,01:24:01.57,"You're not quite worth this muchmoney."""
1231,01:24:04.07,01:24:04.07,"And it hurts, you know?It really does hurt."
1232,01:24:07.17,01:24:07.17,And how can you say that you'rea role model when you're willing
1233,01:24:10.17,01:24:10.17,to discard a valuable friendshiplike that?
1234,01:24:13.97,01:24:13.97,A human being.But I don't want words.
1235,01:24:17.80,01:24:17.80,No words at all.I don't want to talk to you.
1236,01:24:25.97,01:24:25.97,"Honestly, the hardest part forme was the fact that you took"
1237,01:24:29.17,01:24:29.17,away 14 days that I could havespent with Amanda.
1238,01:24:44.53,01:24:44.53,"Amanda, when I told you on thebeach at one point when you"
1239,01:24:49.70,01:24:49.70,"asked me if I was playing you ornot, I told you honestly that"
1240,01:24:52.90,01:24:52.90,I'm not faking it.I'm not faking my feelings for
1241,01:24:56.53,01:24:56.53,"you or anything, no.I really am having feelings that"
1242,01:25:01.40,01:25:01.40,I've never really felt beforeand have never...
1243,01:25:08.03,01:25:08.03,I honestly feel like I startedto fall in love with you.
1244,01:25:13.37,01:25:13.37,And... I don't know.You're just an amazing girl.
1245,01:25:19.57,01:25:19.57,And I really want everybody toknow that.
1246,01:25:22.10,01:25:22.10,And I'm glad I didn't win CookIsland so that I could be here
