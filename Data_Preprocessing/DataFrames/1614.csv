2,00:00:04.00,00:00:04.00,fans of Survivor were pitted against ten of their favorite
3,00:00:08.07,00:00:08.07,players from seasons past. >> You could be a fan of the
4,00:00:11.57,00:00:11.57,"Boston Red Sox, man, but you don't want to play against the"
5,00:00:13.43,00:00:13.43,Boston Red Sox. You're going to get your ass
6,00:00:15.33,00:00:15.33,handed to you. >> JEFF: Let's get it on.
7,00:00:32.37,00:00:32.37,The tropical paradise of Micronesia...
8,00:00:34.57,00:00:34.57,>> Got a big old four-foot shark.
9,00:00:36.50,00:00:36.50,>> JEFF: ...proved to be both bountiful and brutal.
10,00:00:42.73,00:00:42.73,The castaways were unexpectedly battered by storms on a daily
11,00:00:45.43,00:00:45.43,"basis. >> You watch this show at home,"
12,00:00:49.83,00:00:49.83,"and when they show the rain, they show it for, like, 30"
13,00:00:52.07,00:00:52.07,seconds. They're not showing that you're
14,00:00:54.07,00:00:54.07,"standing in the rain for five, six hours straight."
15,00:00:57.17,00:00:57.17,>> JEFF: The conditions were so harsh that one castaway quit.
16,00:01:01.27,00:01:01.27,>> I can't be here one more minute.
17,00:01:03.57,00:01:03.57,I can't take it. >> Bye.
18,00:01:07.33,00:01:07.33,">> Bye. >> JEFF: Throughout the game,"
19,00:01:13.13,00:01:13.13,injuries piled up like never before...
20,00:01:15.80,00:01:15.80,"Our injury tally so far, Penner has a busted-up knee, Parvati"
21,00:01:19.60,00:01:19.60,"has a busted-up lip, Ami has a tweaked knee."
22,00:01:23.53,00:01:23.53,...forcing out two of the game's strongest players.
23,00:01:28.47,00:01:28.47,">> I can only recommend, for the sake of his leg and his life,"
24,00:01:32.30,00:01:32.30,that he leaves the game now. It's not going to get better.
25,00:01:35.50,00:01:35.50,">> Oh, god bless it. >> JEFF: Let's get you out of"
26,00:01:40.53,00:01:40.53,here and get you to a hospital. It was the first time ever that
27,00:01:43.83,00:01:43.83,three players left without being voted out.
28,00:01:47.20,00:01:47.20,But the game continued. An early alliance was formed
29,00:01:50.40,00:01:50.40,"between Amanda, Parvati, and Cirie."
30,00:01:53.40,00:01:53.40,">> All right, ladies, I have both of you guys' words that"
31,00:01:55.83,00:01:55.83,it's us three to the end. >> Yes.
32,00:01:58.50,00:01:58.50,>> Yeah. >> JEFF: The three women stayed
33,00:02:00.27,00:02:00.27,"true to each other throughout the entire game, but Parvati"
34,00:02:02.77,00:02:02.77,made some side deals on her own. >> I might just go ahead and
35,00:02:06.03,00:02:06.03,pull in Natalie and Alexis and take them with me and Amanda and
36,00:02:08.77,00:02:08.77,"Cirie. Everyone else, they're dead to"
37,00:02:11.37,00:02:11.37,me. >> JEFF: All the women banded
38,00:02:14.20,00:02:14.20,together to form a super- alliance which took control of
39,00:02:16.53,00:02:16.53,the game. >> What is the plan?
40,00:02:19.10,00:02:19.10,>> Final five girls. >> JEFF: The first thing on
41,00:02:21.20,00:02:21.20,their agenda was to blindside the biggest threat.
42,00:02:23.40,00:02:23.40,">> This is, like, the perfect opportunity to get rid of Ozzy,"
43,00:02:26.10,00:02:26.10,because he'll never see it coming.
44,00:02:28.73,00:02:28.73,">> JEFF: He had the hidden immunity idol, but he didn't"
45,00:02:31.30,00:02:31.30,"play it. Ozzy, the tribe has spoken."
46,00:02:36.93,00:02:36.93,But Ozzy's exit was just the beginning.
47,00:02:44.97,00:02:44.97,>> It's like the black widow brigade-- all the girls spinning
48,00:02:48.17,00:02:48.17,the guys around as much as we can until they don't know which
49,00:02:50.70,00:02:50.70,"way is up, and then we're devouring them one at a time."
50,00:02:56.53,00:02:56.53,>> JEFF: What happened next was an unprecedented series of
51,00:02:58.90,00:02:58.90,"blindsides. Jason had the idol, but the"
52,00:03:02.20,00:03:02.20,women convinced him that he was safe.
53,00:03:04.40,00:03:04.40,Jason. So he didn't play it.
54,00:03:06.87,00:03:06.87,"At the following tribal council, because Erik had immunity, the"
55,00:03:09.67,00:03:09.67,women were forced to vote out one of their own.
56,00:03:13.13,00:03:13.13,They picked Amanda. >> Pretty much everyone here has
57,00:03:15.47,00:03:15.47,told me they're voting for me tonight.
58,00:03:17.43,00:03:17.43,>> JEFF: But when she produced the hidden immunity idol...
59,00:03:19.70,00:03:19.70,>> I got it! >> JEFF: ...the vote bounced
60,00:03:21.87,00:03:21.87,"back to Alexis. Alexis, you need to bring me"
61,00:03:23.67,00:03:23.67,your torch. And when Erik won immunity
62,00:03:27.83,00:03:27.83,"again... >> Nat, tell him if he were to"
63,00:03:29.90,00:03:29.90,"give you the necklace that would redeem him, and we would vote"
64,00:03:33.53,00:03:33.53,for Amanda. >> Who would fall for that?
65,00:03:36.03,00:03:36.03,>> I want to give individual immunity to Natalie.
66,00:03:39.60,00:03:39.60,>> JEFF: ...they pulled off the biggest blindside in Survivor
67,00:03:41.93,00:03:41.93,history. >> You officially go down as the
68,00:03:46.60,00:03:46.60,"dumbest survivor ever. >> JEFF: Erik, the tribe has"
69,00:03:51.17,00:03:51.17,spoken. Three days left in this game.
70,00:03:56.00,00:03:56.00,Who knows what is going to happen?
71,00:03:59.53,00:03:59.53,Now four are left. Cirie...
72,00:04:02.20,00:04:02.20,">> In this game for me, it's all about who I think I can trust."
73,00:04:05.57,00:04:05.57,"And if I feel that I can trust you, then I'm willing to go all"
74,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,"the way with you. But if I don't trust you, then"
75,00:04:12.00,00:04:12.00,you can't believe a word I tell you.
76,00:04:15.07,00:04:15.07,">> JEFF: ...Natalie... >> I'm in game mode, and now I'm"
77,00:04:20.40,00:04:20.40,actually having a lot more fun. I'm getting to be more of
78,00:04:23.80,00:04:23.80,"myself, which is proving to be pretty ruthless and pretty"
79,00:04:27.07,00:04:27.07,"stone-cold bitch, and pretty cutthroat."
80,00:04:30.67,00:04:30.67,>> JEFF: ...Amanda... >> This is where the game gets
81,00:04:33.43,00:04:33.43,interesting. This season I have developed
82,00:04:35.63,00:04:35.63,"more personal relationships than I did in China, and this game, I"
83,00:04:38.03,00:04:38.03,played completely loyal and just fought my way to the end.
84,00:04:41.77,00:04:41.77,>> JEFF: ...Parvati. >> Coming back and playing
85,00:04:44.10,00:04:44.10,"really aggressively, and pretty much no holds barred for me."
86,00:04:46.63,00:04:46.63,So I haven't been here miserable going through all this crap to
87,00:04:50.23,00:04:50.23,not win this game. >> JEFF: Find out tonight who
88,00:04:53.47,00:04:53.47,will outlast all the rest to become the sole survivor.
89,00:05:19.97,00:05:19.97,">> \xe2\x99\xaa Final four, final four final four, final four. \xe2\x99\xaa"
90,00:05:25.30,00:05:25.30,">> When Erik paused, I was like..."
91,00:05:28.00,00:05:28.00,I know. And I was like...
92,00:05:30.03,00:05:30.03,"And he goes, ""Well, this is risky."""
93,00:05:33.17,00:05:33.17,"And I was like, ""It's in the bag."
94,00:05:35.27,00:05:35.27,"It is in the bag!"" Everyone has fallen into our"
95,00:05:39.43,00:05:39.43,trap. Everyone.
96,00:05:42.47,00:05:42.47,And it's the same trap over and over and over again.
97,00:05:45.30,00:05:45.30,And every single person keeps falling into it.
98,00:05:47.90,00:05:47.90,">> When I wrote his name down, I said, ""My mama always told me"
99,00:05:51.63,00:05:51.63,you might not be able to beat them with these but you can
100,00:05:54.77,00:05:54.77,"always beat them with this."" We couldn't beat Erik at"
101,00:05:57.60,00:05:57.60,anything. But now that's all taken care
102,00:06:00.27,00:06:00.27,of. Erik's somewhere having a
103,00:06:02.90,00:06:02.90,"sandwich, and we're going to continue with the game."
104,00:06:05.40,00:06:05.40,>> That's four back-to-back blindsides which you girls have
105,00:06:07.73,00:06:07.73,managed to evade every single one of them.
106,00:06:09.87,00:06:09.87,">> Wow. >> Like, let's see what happens"

110,00:07:19.63,00:07:19.63,How long have you been up for? >> I don't know.
111,00:07:21.80,00:07:21.80,Probably an hour. >> Did you sleep good?
112,00:07:24.13,00:07:24.13,>> Mm-hmm. >> We were talking about Erik.
113,00:07:27.60,00:07:27.60,">> Oh, it's just tearing my heart out that there aren't any"
114,00:07:33.97,00:07:33.97,guys around here. Can't you see the tears in my
115,00:07:36.63,00:07:36.63,eyes? >> These guys just walk right
116,00:07:40.47,00:07:40.47,"into the Venus flytrap, and they get eaten alive."
117,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,>> Yeah. >> Heist number four...
118,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,>> In a row. >> ...goes off without a hitch.
119,00:07:50.60,00:07:50.60,>> I'm going to check and see if my money is still in my pocket
120,00:07:53.00,00:07:53.00,around y'all. I can't trust you.
121,00:07:55.53,00:07:55.53,I'm nervous around y'all. >> I'm nervous around you.
122,00:08:26.97,00:08:26.97,">> Oh, my god! That's so many!"
123,00:08:29.37,00:08:29.37,"Nice job, Parv. >> I haven't missed the guys"
124,00:08:32.37,00:08:32.37,here for one second. I love having this group of
125,00:08:34.80,00:08:34.80,"girls here, Just chilling, hanging out, without the big"
126,00:08:37.53,00:08:37.53,"egos running around and the guys trying to, you know, provide and"
127,00:08:41.10,00:08:41.10,look cool in front of the ladies.
128,00:08:43.93,00:08:43.93,I love just me and the girls. >> This has been a really hard
129,00:08:46.77,00:08:46.77,season. >> It's been so hard.
130,00:08:49.00,00:08:49.00,>> Because all the freaking girls are smart girls in this
131,00:08:51.03,00:08:51.03,season. >> I'm not kidding.
132,00:08:53.57,00:08:53.57,And we beat them out with our brains.
133,00:08:55.77,00:08:55.77,I can't believe we beat those guys.
134,00:08:59.83,00:08:59.83,">> Oh, my god. I'm just so thankful to be here."
135,00:09:05.13,00:09:05.13,>> I'm so thankful that you're here.
136,00:09:07.70,00:09:07.70,"I feel like you have a way of, like, convincing people, and"
137,00:09:10.93,00:09:10.93,"they're like, ""You're so right."" You really should... you really"
138,00:09:13.67,00:09:13.67,should swallow your pride and ask for whatever you want all
139,00:09:16.47,00:09:16.47,the time. >> I know.
140,00:09:18.33,00:09:18.33,I feel I live out of fear in my normal life a lot.
141,00:09:20.97,00:09:20.97,"I'm so scared of people saying no, so I don't ask."
142,00:09:24.10,00:09:24.10,>> Yeah. But your life could be so much
143,00:09:26.67,00:09:26.67,better if you just ask for things that you want.
144,00:09:29.43,00:09:29.43,>> I know. >> You know?
145,00:09:31.23,00:09:31.23,">> I know. My position at this point, I'm"
146,00:09:33.13,00:09:33.13,the only fan left. They're all favorites.
147,00:09:35.47,00:09:35.47,They all started on a tribe together.
148,00:09:38.10,00:09:38.10,But I've definitely made a personal bond and connection
149,00:09:40.43,00:09:40.43,with Parvati. We get each other.
150,00:09:42.87,00:09:42.87,We have great conversation. So I think we complement each
151,00:09:46.90,00:09:46.90,"other well. >> Honestly, I think the people"
152,00:09:49.27,00:09:49.27,"that you encounter when you do things like this, like, the"
153,00:09:55.07,00:09:55.07,"people that you're with, you have to know that they are there"
154,00:09:59.07,00:09:59.07,for a reason. >> Yeah.
155,00:10:01.77,00:10:01.77,>> You know? And there's a reason that you
156,00:10:03.83,00:10:03.83,and I are here together. We have a one-in-four shot of
157,00:10:05.60,00:10:05.60,winning a million dollars right now.
158,00:10:07.27,00:10:07.27,>> Yeah. >> Unbelievable.
159,00:10:12.40,00:10:12.40,">> But everyone here has earned their spot in the final three,"
160,00:10:14.30,00:10:14.30,you know? >> Absolutely.
161,00:10:16.47,00:10:16.47,>> Everyone here has played a damn good game.
162,00:10:18.33,00:10:18.33,>> Yeah. I think Parvati is an ally for
163,00:10:20.50,00:10:20.50,me in this game. My conversations and my heart-
164,00:10:22.97,00:10:22.97,to-hearts with Parvati and our great connection-- does it
165,00:10:26.20,00:10:26.20,benefit me at all if we're closer than not?
166,00:10:31.10,00:10:31.10,Of course. >> Tree mail!
167,00:10:37.43,00:10:37.43,">> What does it say? >> Yeah, I was hoping for food."
168,00:10:40.07,00:10:40.07,">> Me, too. >> Reward or immunity?"
169,00:10:43.10,00:10:43.10,"Does it say? >> ""Indeed you've accomplished a"
170,00:10:45.40,00:10:45.40,noble task. You've made it the final four.
171,00:10:47.93,00:10:47.93,"To climb the heights of victory, you need to scramble once more."""
172,00:10:51.50,00:10:51.50,>> What? >> It's immunity.
173,00:10:54.03,00:10:54.03,Today? >> Wow.
174,00:10:56.43,00:10:56.43,>> I am not happy. >> We're thinking that winning
175,00:10:59.80,00:10:59.80,this challenge is pretty much guaranteed final three.
176,00:11:03.83,00:11:03.83,"So we have to beat Natalie. I mean, we love the fact that"
177,00:11:07.23,00:11:07.23,"it's all women, but being that it's all women, one of us has to"
178,00:11:10.50,00:11:10.50,go. >> JEFF: Four ladies feeling oh
179,00:11:39.63,00:11:39.63,so good about themselves. You guys ready to get to today's
180,00:11:44.83,00:11:44.83,immunity challenge? >> Yep.
181,00:11:47.03,00:11:47.03,">> JEFF: First things first. Natalie, I'll take back that"
182,00:11:48.87,00:11:48.87,"necklace. Once again, immunity is back up"
183,00:11:58.20,00:11:58.20,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
184,00:12:01.13,00:12:01.13,start on a very small perch at the top of a 20-foot pole in the
185,00:12:06.20,00:12:06.20,"water. On my go, you will use a bucket"
186,00:12:08.43,00:12:08.43,to gather water that you will then pour into a bamboo chute.
187,00:12:12.50,00:12:12.50,"As the water fills up the chute, it will raise a set of keys."
188,00:12:15.80,00:12:15.80,"You'll take those keys, you'll swim back to shore and use them"
189,00:12:18.60,00:12:18.60,to unlock a chest containing 16 individually shaped ladder
190,00:12:24.03,00:12:24.03,rungs. The first person to correctly
191,00:12:27.43,00:12:27.43,"assemble their ladder, climb to the top, and raise their flag,"
192,00:12:30.50,00:12:30.50,"wins immunity, guaranteed a one- in-three shot at winning this"
193,00:12:34.00,00:12:34.00,game. Make sense?
194,00:12:36.57,00:12:36.57,>> Yep. >> Yep.
195,00:12:38.50,00:12:38.50,>> JEFF: We'll draw for position.
196,00:12:40.10,00:12:40.10,"We'll get started. Here we go, for immunity and a"
197,00:12:55.70,00:12:55.70,guaranteed spot in the final three.
198,00:12:58.20,00:12:58.20,Survivors ready? Go.
199,00:13:04.37,00:13:04.37,"Going to pull up that bucket full of water, and then pour it"
200,00:13:07.63,00:13:07.63,"down that bamboo chute. The more water you get in, the"
201,00:13:13.33,00:13:13.33,faster you will raise those keys up to where you can grab them.
202,00:13:26.97,00:13:26.97,Natalie having a lot of success. Parvati got most of it in the
203,00:13:31.93,00:13:31.93,chute. Doesn't matter how fast you pull
204,00:13:35.00,00:13:35.00,up the water if you don't pour it in the chute.
205,00:13:41.33,00:13:41.33,Natalie doing a great job. Can't quite reach her keys.
206,00:13:46.57,00:13:46.57,Parvati and Natalie neck and neck right now.
207,00:13:56.87,00:13:56.87,Natalie has her keys. She's in the water.
208,00:14:03.67,00:14:03.67,Parvati very close. Parvati reaching for her keys.
209,00:14:09.53,00:14:09.53,Parvati unclips. She's in the water.
210,00:14:14.10,00:14:14.10,Got to get to shore and open that chest.
211,00:14:17.83,00:14:17.83,Amanda reaching for those keys. Can't do it.
212,00:14:21.20,00:14:21.20,Going to take another bucket of water.
213,00:14:24.00,00:14:24.00,Natalie and Parvati with a big lead at this point.
214,00:14:26.50,00:14:26.50,Both opening their chests up. Amanda has her set of keys.
215,00:14:39.87,00:14:39.87,Got to unclip. She's in the water.
216,00:14:46.00,00:14:46.00,"Cirie, is it close enough? Cirie reaches for the keys."
217,00:14:50.97,00:14:50.97,Cirie has her keys! Get in that water.
218,00:14:56.70,00:14:56.70,Everybody is in this. Natalie continues to extend her
219,00:15:01.03,00:15:01.03,lead. This ladder will take some time
220,00:15:04.40,00:15:04.40,to assemble. Only one person going to walk
221,00:15:08.63,00:15:08.63,away from here with immunity. The other three vulnerable at
222,00:15:11.43,00:15:11.43,tonight's tribal council. You have 16 ladder rungs.
223,00:15:17.70,00:15:17.70,Each ladder rung is individually shaped and will only go into one
224,00:15:22.40,00:15:22.40,"slot on that ladder. If you have to force it, it's"
225,00:15:26.70,00:15:26.70,"not right. If you have a lot of play, it's"
226,00:15:29.10,00:15:29.10,"not right. 16 different options, but it"
227,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,only goes together one way. Amanda appears to be making some
228,00:15:44.83,00:15:44.83,progress. Parvati's got some rungs in her
229,00:15:48.07,00:15:48.07,ladder. Natalie and Cirie trying to make
230,00:15:50.33,00:15:50.33,sure they're right. Merely getting to the top is not
231,00:15:53.43,00:15:53.43,enough. Amanda making a lot of progress.
232,00:15:57.73,00:15:57.73,"If she's right, that's a big lead."
233,00:16:02.43,00:16:02.43,Parvati skipping up ahead. Putting some of the higher
234,00:16:05.77,00:16:05.77,ladder rungs in first. Cirie is working her way up
235,00:16:09.23,00:16:09.23,methodically from the bottom. Natalie having a little trouble
236,00:16:14.37,00:16:14.37,with this puzzle. Amanda pulling away from the
237,00:16:17.83,00:16:17.83,"pack. At this point, it is Amanda's"
238,00:16:22.13,00:16:22.13,challenge to lose. She has a huge lead.
239,00:16:30.17,00:16:30.17,Amanda can't get that last rung in.
240,00:16:33.07,00:16:33.07,Something's not right. Amanda going now rung by rung
241,00:16:36.20,00:16:36.20,trying to figure out where she's off.
242,00:16:39.43,00:16:39.43,Natalie getting closer. Amanda swapping pieces out.
243,00:16:46.10,00:16:46.10,"Immunity so close. Amanda thinks she has it, and"
244,00:16:54.13,00:16:54.13,she does. Amanda wins immunity!
245,00:16:59.27,00:16:59.27,">> Good job, girl. >> Good job."
246,00:17:04.17,00:17:04.17,">> Oh, my god! >> Good job, girl."
247,00:17:06.83,00:17:06.83,"That was tough. >> JEFF: Amanda, come on over."
248,00:17:11.90,00:17:11.90,Congratulations. >> Thank you.
249,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,>> JEFF: Guaranteed a one-in- three shot at winning this game
250,00:17:20.37,00:17:20.37,and the million bucks that goes with it.
251,00:17:22.63,00:17:22.63,"Natalie, Cirie, Parvati, after 37 hard-fought days, one of you"
252,00:17:25.60,00:17:25.60,will not make it to the final. Figure out who that's going to
253,00:17:28.97,00:17:28.97,"be tonight at tribal council. Grab your stuff, head out."
254,00:17:31.13,00:17:31.13,See you at tribal. >> The only reason you beat me
255,00:17:48.13,00:17:48.13,is because your legs are longer than mine.
256,00:17:50.17,00:17:50.17,">> Right. >> Me, too."
257,00:17:52.10,00:17:52.10,>> I was right hot on your trail.
258,00:17:53.73,00:17:53.73,">> Oh, I know, girl. >> We all were."
259,00:17:58.23,00:17:58.23,>> I'm in the final three. I can't believe it.
260,00:18:01.27,00:18:01.27,"I'm really, like... I'm ecstatic."
261,00:18:03.87,00:18:03.87,"And that's, like, twice in a row."
262,00:18:06.60,00:18:06.60,"And this time I have played my game so different, and I feel so"
263,00:18:09.33,00:18:09.33,much better about it. >> We could set Gloria free.
264,00:18:22.50,00:18:22.50,">> You know, they always talk about the lowest man on the"
265,00:18:24.93,00:18:24.93,totem pole. I do indeed feel like the low
266,00:18:27.00,00:18:27.00,woman on the totem pole. But am I just going to tuck my
267,00:18:31.17,00:18:31.17,"tail between my legs and scurry out of here and say, ""Bye, guys,"
268,00:18:33.60,00:18:33.60,"well, it was great, I'm going home""?"
269,00:18:37.03,00:18:37.03,"No, I'm going to explore all my options."
270,00:18:40.10,00:18:40.10,"If Gloria is anything like the women on this camp, she'll mate"
271,00:18:43.70,00:18:43.70,with that dude and then rip his neck off.
272,00:18:48.57,00:18:48.57,">> Oh, that's funny. >> I'm dealing women who are as"
273,00:18:52.33,00:18:52.33,smart as I am. So if I go in and I'm hustling
274,00:18:54.73,00:18:54.73,"and I'm shaking and I'm moving and I'm stressing, they're going"
275,00:18:58.03,00:18:58.03,"to see right through it. So I think if I'm calm, cool,"
276,00:19:00.77,00:19:00.77,and collected there's a way to weasel in and communicate with
277,00:19:03.60,00:19:03.60,them in a way that may seem reasonable.
278,00:19:20.57,00:19:20.57,>> This sucks. I hate when it gets to this
279,00:19:23.97,00:19:23.97,point. Why can't we all just stay?
280,00:19:27.13,00:19:27.13,Why can't they have a final four?
281,00:19:29.13,00:19:29.13,">> That would be cool. >> I don't know, Natty, girl."
282,00:19:34.73,00:19:34.73,I don't know. Have you promised anybody your
283,00:19:37.83,00:19:37.83,"vote? Oh, good."
284,00:19:41.73,00:19:41.73,>> No. >> Good.
285,00:19:48.00,00:19:48.00,>> I believe Cirie is quite nervous as far as jury votes are
286,00:19:50.20,00:19:50.20,concerned. I could use this to address
287,00:19:53.40,00:19:53.40,Parvati to help me out. It's kind of a little glimmer at
288,00:19:56.83,00:19:56.83,"the end of the tunnel, a little light, because I do firmly"
289,00:19:59.23,00:19:59.23,believe that Parvati would go out on a limb for me.
290,00:20:06.10,00:20:06.10,>> Huh? >> How good of a shot do we have
291,00:20:09.47,00:20:09.47,"to win this, do you think? >> Huge."
292,00:20:11.23,00:20:11.23,>> Yeah? >> You and I?
293,00:20:12.93,00:20:12.93,I think it's between you and I. >> Really?
294,00:20:14.57,00:20:14.57,>> Mm-hmm. >> Definitely.
295,00:20:22.50,00:20:22.50,>> It's been kind of our plan from pretty much the beginning
296,00:20:26.03,00:20:26.03,"to have me, Parv and Cirie in the final three."
297,00:20:28.93,00:20:28.93,But I think Cirie is definitely a threat as far as swaying
298,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,votes from the jury one way or the other.
299,00:20:34.63,00:20:34.63,"And I don't want Natalie to go. I think, you know, she"
300,00:20:36.93,00:20:36.93,definitely deserves to be here. I think she's played a good
301,00:20:38.87,00:20:38.87,"game. Cirie, she knows that if Natalie"
302,00:20:44.03,00:20:44.03,"would have won, Nat would have voted with me and you and Cirie"
303,00:20:46.83,00:20:46.83,would have been gone. >> True.
304,00:20:49.97,00:20:49.97,>> I don't know who I'm voting for tonight.
305,00:20:51.80,00:20:51.80,"I mean, it's hard. It's far in the game."
306,00:20:53.80,00:20:53.80,"You know, it's not easy. You know everyone is still"
307,00:20:56.47,00:20:56.47,playing the game at this point. It would be stupid not to still
308,00:20:59.13,00:20:59.13,be playing the game. >> I give Natalie so much
309,00:21:01.70,00:21:01.70,"credit. >> Me, too."
310,00:21:03.73,00:21:03.73,>> Cirie got lucky to be with us.
311,00:21:11.87,00:21:11.87,>> Yeah. >> You okay?
312,00:21:25.87,00:21:25.87,>> Mm-hmm. >> I was like...
313,00:21:31.90,00:21:31.90,"""No. You're asking me this right now"
314,00:21:34.93,00:21:34.93,"because..."" >> I love Natalie to death, and"
315,00:21:45.43,00:21:45.43,I think she's a lesser threat as far as jury votes than Cirie.
316,00:21:49.30,00:21:49.30,"And now the time has come where it's, like, I could switch it up"
317,00:21:54.47,00:21:54.47,"now, and then we have our biggest jury threat out of the"
318,00:21:57.63,00:21:57.63,"game. But, seriously, in this game,"
319,00:22:00.63,00:22:00.63,"and how this game's been played all these women are so crafty, I"
320,00:22:04.70,00:22:04.70,wouldn't put it past any single one of us to work some kind of
321,00:22:07.87,00:22:07.87,deal out and make it to the three.
322,00:22:14.63,00:22:14.63,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
323,00:22:25.77,00:22:25.77,>> I could be going home tonight.
324,00:22:28.07,00:22:28.07,"They could have made a deal with Natalie and decided, ""You know"
325,00:22:29.93,00:22:29.93,what? We like you better.
326,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,"Cirie's out."" And smiling in my face."
327,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,I saw their work already. We duped so many people....
328,00:22:42.27,00:22:42.27,>> ...with straight faces. >> JEFF: We'll now bring in the
329,00:23:05.73,00:23:05.73,"members of our jury. Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,"
330,00:23:13.00,00:23:13.00,"Alexis, and Erik, voted out at the last tribal council."
331,00:23:28.37,00:23:28.37,So we have a final four consisting of only women.
332,00:23:33.73,00:23:33.73,And all of you women have been involved in another first-- four
333,00:23:37.00,00:23:37.00,"straight blindsides. Natalie, after the performance"
334,00:23:41.03,00:23:41.03,"from the four of you at the last tribal council, you all should"
335,00:23:44.27,00:23:44.27,be nominated for a Survivor Academy Award.
336,00:23:47.93,00:23:47.93,"It was masterful to watch. >> No disrespect to anyone, but"
337,00:23:53.90,00:23:53.90,it went down seamlessly. We achieved an impossible task.
338,00:23:57.97,00:23:57.97,So it was a great feeling. >> JEFF: So after four straight
339,00:24:01.97,00:24:01.97,"blindsides, what's the feeling going into tonight's vote?"
340,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,">> I think at this point, the four of us respect each other"
341,00:24:09.63,00:24:09.63,enough that I don't think there would be a blindside.
342,00:24:12.07,00:24:12.07,I would pray for a blindside on some level.
343,00:24:16.07,00:24:16.07,Like now it would actually benefit me better than all the
344,00:24:18.10,00:24:18.10,"other four. >> JEFF: Amanda, how concerned"
345,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,are you tonight that you know exactly what's happening?
346,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,">> At this point, Jeff, I have no idea what's going on."
347,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53,"I mean, how many times does a blindside have to happen before"
348,00:24:31.80,00:24:31.80,you figure out that you know nothing about what's going on at
349,00:24:35.10,00:24:35.10,all? I'm fairly confident that I know
350,00:24:37.97,00:24:37.97,"what's going to happen tonight, but I can't be certain."
351,00:24:41.67,00:24:41.67,">> JEFF: Parvati, it seems to me only a fool would say anything"
352,00:24:45.13,00:24:45.13,with confidence at tribal council.
353,00:24:48.50,00:24:48.50,"All you have to do is look across at Ozzy, and Jason, and"
354,00:24:51.50,00:24:51.50,"Alexis, and Erik. They were all certain they"
355,00:24:56.93,00:24:56.93,"weren't going home. >> Yeah, I think this has been"
356,00:24:59.20,00:24:59.20,"the craziest, messiest, most strategic game in the history of"
357,00:25:04.57,00:25:04.57,"Survivor. So for anyone to feel confident,"
358,00:25:07.63,00:25:07.63,"it's ludicrous. But I can't read anyone's mind,"
359,00:25:10.33,00:25:10.33,and I don't know what anyone else is thinking but myself.
360,00:25:13.20,00:25:13.20,">> JEFF: Amanda, have you guys talked about, ""What do we do"
361,00:25:17.00,00:25:17.00,"when there are only three people left?"""
362,00:25:19.60,00:25:19.60,"Or have you been assuming, ""That's all I've got to do is"
363,00:25:21.97,00:25:21.97,"just get to final three and I'm good to go""?"
364,00:25:24.93,00:25:24.93,">> No one here, I think I can honestly say that, is expecting"
365,00:25:29.17,00:25:29.17,"a final two. At this point in the game, it"
366,00:25:31.23,00:25:31.23,would take us for another whirlwind.
367,00:25:33.07,00:25:33.07,">> JEFF: Cirie, how would it change the game if you knew it"
368,00:25:35.33,00:25:35.33,"was a final two? >> I mean, it is nerve-wracking"
369,00:25:38.60,00:25:38.60,"to think it could be a final two, because that makes me feel"
370,00:25:42.27,00:25:42.27,"like, once again, I'm on the bottom of the alliance, which is"
371,00:25:47.03,00:25:47.03,"not a good place to be, Jeff. >> I just have a question-- when"
372,00:25:50.17,00:25:50.17,did you ever think you were on the bottom of the alliance?
373,00:25:53.33,00:25:53.33,">> No, no, no, from the five, when I started with you, Ozzy,"
374,00:25:56.37,00:25:56.37,"James, and Parvati, basically, it's unspoken that I'm on the"
375,00:25:59.00,00:25:59.00,bottom. Ozzy wanted you four to be in
376,00:26:02.23,00:26:02.23,the final four. So where does that place me when
377,00:26:04.77,00:26:04.77,we're going to the five? That makes me fifth.
378,00:26:07.40,00:26:07.40,>> I'm talking about after the merge.
379,00:26:09.10,00:26:09.10,"Like, when have you felt on the bottom?"
380,00:26:11.07,00:26:11.07,>> Always. >> Always?
381,00:26:13.10,00:26:13.10,">> Between us three? It's obvious, because not one"
382,00:26:16.43,00:26:16.43,"person in any alliance has ever said, ""I won't vote for Cirie."""
383,00:26:21.23,00:26:21.23,"You have said, ""I won't vote for"" certain people."
384,00:26:23.67,00:26:23.67,"She has said, ""I won't vote for you."""
385,00:26:25.87,00:26:25.87,So that clearly places me at the bottom of the alliance.
386,00:26:28.63,00:26:28.63,>> I'm just wondering. >> And I'm explaining how I feel
387,00:26:31.00,00:26:31.00,that way. I would be foolish not to think
388,00:26:33.80,00:26:33.80,"that. >> JEFF: Natalie, you're holding"
389,00:26:40.20,00:26:40.20,"back a big grin. >> I think at this point,"
390,00:26:43.03,00:26:43.03,"anything's an opportunity. You know, I'm just letting them"
391,00:26:45.33,00:26:45.33,"duke it out, and may the best woman win."
392,00:26:51.37,00:26:51.37,">> JEFF: All right, let's get to the vote."
393,00:26:53.60,00:26:53.60,"Amanda, you have the immunity necklace, you're not planning on"
394,00:26:55.63,00:26:55.63,"giving it to anyone else, are you?"
395,00:26:57.47,00:26:57.47,>> No. >> JEFF: You cannot vote for
396,00:26:59.73,00:26:59.73,Amanda. Everybody else is fair game.
397,00:27:01.43,00:27:01.43,"It is time to vote. Amanda, you're up."
398,00:27:42.93,00:27:42.93,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
399,00:27:59.07,00:27:59.07,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
400,00:28:01.03,00:28:01.03,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
401,00:28:03.00,00:28:03.00,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
402,00:28:07.83,00:28:07.83,"First vote, Cirie. Natalie."
403,00:28:17.30,00:28:17.30,"One vote Natalie, one vote Cirie."
404,00:28:23.30,00:28:23.30,"Natalie. Two votes Natalie, one vote"
405,00:28:26.43,00:28:26.43,Cirie. 14th person voted out and the
406,00:28:32.07,00:28:32.07,"seventh member of our jury, Natalie."
407,00:28:34.37,00:28:34.37,That's three. That's enough.
408,00:28:35.97,00:28:35.97,"You need to bring me your torch. Natalie, the tribe has spoken."
409,00:28:57.13,00:28:57.13,"Time for you to go. Well, once again you have"
410,00:29:11.20,00:29:11.20,survived the vote and made it to the final three.
411,00:29:14.17,00:29:14.17,"Congratulations. Grab your torches, head back to"
412,00:29:16.20,00:29:16.20,camp. Good night.
413,00:29:24.67,00:29:24.67,>> I have to say that I am pretty happy with the way that I
414,00:29:26.90,00:29:26.90,played the game. I was the last fan standing.
415,00:29:29.47,00:29:29.47,And I feel proud of the group of girls they finished with.
416,00:29:33.80,00:29:33.80,I respect the way that you guys played the game with me.
417,00:29:36.10,00:29:36.10,So thank you. >> That was a weird tribal
418,00:29:53.07,00:29:53.07,"tonight, wasn't it? >> I don't think I've ever been"
419,00:29:55.70,00:29:55.70,so exhausted in my entire life. >> You and me both.
420,00:30:01.07,00:30:01.07,>> What am I doing? >> You were trying to make us
421,00:30:02.93,00:30:02.93,look so awful at tribal. >> How?
422,00:30:05.10,00:30:05.10,"You asked me how I think I'm on the bottom of an alliance, and I"
423,00:30:08.83,00:30:08.83,explained to you every single alliance that I've been in how
424,00:30:12.13,00:30:12.13,I'm on the bottom. >> That's bull( no audio )
425,00:30:15.40,00:30:15.40,Just be real. >> How is it bull ( no audio )?
426,00:30:18.80,00:30:18.80,That's not game. That's real facts.
427,00:30:21.40,00:30:21.40,That's exactly what this is. I should be...
428,00:30:24.20,00:30:24.20,">> Because in the five, how are you on the outs?"
429,00:30:26.80,00:30:26.80,">> Because you're snuggled up over there with James, she's"
430,00:30:29.70,00:30:29.70,snuggled up over there with Ozzy.
431,00:30:31.77,00:30:31.77,Most of the time y'all four are together.
432,00:30:33.60,00:30:33.60,"If you were me, what would you feel?"
433,00:30:35.73,00:30:35.73,"I mean, be me for a minute. And because I said it out loud,"
434,00:30:38.57,00:30:38.57,you're upset? With this alliance with y'all
435,00:30:41.20,00:30:41.20,"two, she told me she couldn't vote you."
436,00:30:43.80,00:30:43.80,So that makes me at the bottom of this alliance.
437,00:30:46.13,00:30:46.13,"Have any one of you ever said, ""I can't vote Cirie out?"""
438,00:30:49.43,00:30:49.43,>> How do you know? >> Yes or no?
439,00:30:51.60,00:30:51.60,I'm asking you. >> How do you know?
440,00:30:53.13,00:30:53.13,>> Have I talked to you about final two?
441,00:30:55.37,00:30:55.37,I feel that I've been at the bottom of every single alliance.
442,00:30:58.50,00:30:58.50,">> I just don't see that, and I haven't seen that."
443,00:31:00.70,00:31:00.70,I haven't seen that the whole game.
444,00:31:02.33,00:31:02.33,>> You're not me. You're not me.
445,00:31:03.87,00:31:03.87,That's why you can't see it. >> I can't understand you when
446,00:31:06.63,00:31:06.63,"you're screaming at me. >> Okay, I'm not screaming."
447,00:31:09.20,00:31:09.20,>> Thank you. >> I can't explain it any more.
448,00:31:11.40,00:31:11.40,"I don't know how else to say it. >> Yeah, I know."
449,00:31:14.13,00:31:14.13,"I mean, it makes sense. >> I know."
450,00:31:18.07,00:31:18.07,"I'm sorry. >> I'm sorry for yelling at you,"
451,00:31:20.17,00:31:20.17,"but don't... >> No, I know."
452,00:31:22.07,00:31:22.07,I'm just... >> ...accuse me of stuff that
453,00:31:23.80,00:31:23.80,I'm... >> I wasn't trying to accuse
454,00:31:25.67,00:31:25.67,"you. It came out very badly, and I'm"
455,00:31:27.47,00:31:27.47,sorry. I'm just on my breaking point
456,00:31:29.67,00:31:29.67,right now. >> I know.
457,00:31:37.13,00:31:37.13,>> You have two more days. >> I know.
458,00:31:39.40,00:31:39.40,">> Let me give you a hug, because this is pitiful for us"
459,00:31:42.23,00:31:42.23,to make it this far and then you be...
460,00:31:44.73,00:31:44.73,">> I know, I'm sorry. >> No, it's all right."
461,00:31:46.67,00:31:46.67,It's all right. >> I didn't mean it like that.
462,00:31:49.73,00:31:49.73,I just kind of broke down and I started yelling at Cirie about
463,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,stupid things that I don't even know why I yelled.
464,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,"And it's...I feel like I've been doing this forever, you know?"
465,00:32:01.37,00:32:01.37,"Straight from China, I come here, and it just... I just"
466,00:32:04.00,00:32:04.00,can't take it. I almost lost it when Jeff
467,00:32:07.50,00:32:07.50,"mentioned that there might be a final two, and I lost it."
468,00:32:11.13,00:32:11.13,>> Oh! >> There's no way it would be a
469,00:32:14.47,00:32:14.47,final two. There's no way.
470,00:32:17.27,00:32:17.27,">> Yeah, don't say that again, Parv, because you've been wrong"
471,00:32:19.67,00:32:19.67,every time. You don't comfort me by saying
472,00:32:21.83,00:32:21.83,that. It's been the plan from day one
473,00:32:24.93,00:32:24.93,"for Parvati, Amanda, myself to be final three, and it would"
474,00:32:27.87,00:32:27.87,just break my heart to find out it's going to be a final two.
475,00:32:32.30,00:32:32.30,"So I want to celebrate, but there's, like, that hint in the"
476,00:32:37.53,00:32:37.53,back of my mind-- don't get falsely happy and then find out
477,00:32:40.77,00:32:40.77,this is not the end of it. >> It's the final three.
478,00:32:44.00,00:32:44.00,Everybody just needs to chill out.
479,00:32:46.33,00:32:46.33,>> Did you find a machete? Because all that yelling makes
480,00:32:48.60,00:32:48.60,me thirsty. >> 38 days.
481,00:33:04.67,00:33:04.67,I really don't think I will ever touch a coconut again.
482,00:33:07.20,00:33:07.20,>> We need a tree mail here. >> Relax.
483,00:33:12.33,00:33:12.33,>> I am ecstatic to be here in the final three with these two
484,00:33:17.00,00:33:17.00,girls. At least we assume it's a final
485,00:33:19.10,00:33:19.10,"three. It's been a long road, and we"
486,00:33:23.80,00:33:23.80,feel very blessed to be here with each other.
487,00:33:26.43,00:33:26.43,"Come on out. >> Come on, Gloria."
488,00:33:28.80,00:33:28.80,">> We're celebrating by setting our mascot free, Gloria."
489,00:33:32.73,00:33:32.73,She's our last chicken standing. >> Get out of there!
490,00:33:36.43,00:33:36.43,>> Yay! >> Uh-oh!
491,00:33:40.63,00:33:40.63,Rather than try to kill Gloria and have her flopping around
492,00:33:44.27,00:33:44.27,"in misery, we decided we can not eat."
493,00:33:49.30,00:33:49.30,We only have a couple of days left.
494,00:33:51.20,00:33:51.20,Let Gloria go. She might not leave here.
495,00:33:53.20,00:33:53.20,This is her home. She's making a nest to lay the
496,00:33:57.73,00:33:57.73,"damn egg. >> Unfortunately, Gloria doesn't"
497,00:34:01.90,00:34:01.90,"want to leave camp. She's, like, hanging around."
498,00:34:04.90,00:34:04.90,She's like a pet dog now. I guess she doesn't realize that
499,00:34:08.53,00:34:08.53,this is over. It's a done deal.
500,00:34:21.40,00:34:21.40,">> We're the craftiest survivors of all time, to be modest."
501,00:34:24.23,00:34:24.23,>> Nice. Nice.
502,00:34:27.13,00:34:27.13,>> What is it? It doesn't look like food.
503,00:34:30.70,00:34:30.70,>> No. >> What?
504,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,"Oh, my... >> It looks like a challenge."
505,00:34:36.20,00:34:36.20,Freaking paddle. All right.
506,00:34:40.30,00:34:40.30,"""Congratulations, final three. You have done what 17 of your"
507,00:34:45.97,00:34:45.97,fellow tribesmen and women could not.
508,00:34:49.23,00:34:49.23,Today you will honor their memories before proceeding to
509,00:34:52.33,00:34:52.33,your final immunity challenge. Get into your boat and head out
510,00:34:56.53,00:34:56.53,to Exile Island. There you will find the torches
511,00:34:59.90,00:34:59.90,of your fallen comrades. Reflect upon them as they each
512,00:35:02.90,00:35:02.90,had a part in getting you to this point.
513,00:35:05.97,00:35:05.97,"You'll then proceed to your final immunity challenge."""
514,00:35:08.43,00:35:08.43,">> Oh, my god. >> Wow."
515,00:35:12.90,00:35:12.90,">> My heart just dropped. >> All right, let's go, ladies."
516,00:35:20.97,00:35:20.97,">> We got tree mail today, and we thought there was going to be"
517,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,"like, food, you know, for the final three."
518,00:35:29.57,00:35:29.57,And it's another immunity challenge.
519,00:35:33.80,00:35:33.80,"It's like, when is it going to end, you know?"
520,00:35:35.80,00:35:35.80,"Like, there's only so much you can take, and then someone has"
521,00:35:37.57,00:35:37.57,"to leave now, like, after everything."
522,00:35:40.23,00:35:40.23,"I am so tight with these girls. Like, this just sucks"
523,00:35:42.60,00:35:42.60,completely. >> It's never ending.
524,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,">> I feel sick. >> Me, too."
525,00:36:00.30,00:36:00.30,The fact that it's a final two and not a final three was almost
526,00:36:05.37,00:36:05.37,"poetic. I mean, we've been blindsiding"
527,00:36:08.37,00:36:08.37,"people left and right, and essentially we got blindsided."
528,00:36:11.77,00:36:11.77,"We thought we had it made. I guess, you know, what goes"
529,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,around comes around. >> Okay.
530,00:36:20.10,00:36:20.10,"...regroup, get it together. >> One more time."
531,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,>> I need to regroup. Now we have to kick it back into
532,00:36:26.87,00:36:26.87,gear and get ready for this immunity challenge today.
533,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,"And for me, it's taken me down a peg."
534,00:36:32.57,00:36:32.57,"Like, I feel a little bit humbled."
535,00:36:34.57,00:36:34.57,But I think the rites of passage will give me a little
536,00:36:36.53,00:36:36.53,"perspective, because it's a chance for us to honor everyone"
537,00:36:39.67,00:36:39.67,"that we fought so hard to beat, and I think we all want to give"
538,00:36:43.10,00:36:43.10,those people credit for being such strong competitors and for
539,00:36:45.87,00:36:45.87,not making it easy on us. >> I can't feel bad.
540,00:36:55.63,00:36:55.63,"Look how far I made it. I mean, we started out with 20"
541,00:36:57.50,00:36:57.50,people. And they were all hard-core
542,00:36:59.93,00:36:59.93,"players, and would love to be here right now."
543,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,"So I want to tip my hat to them and say, you know, ""Good job."
544,00:37:08.60,00:37:08.60,"I beat you, but good job."" >> Oh, thank god."
545,00:37:31.00,00:37:31.00,He was actually kind of a decent guy while he lasted.
546,00:37:34.37,00:37:34.37,Let's do it. >> I consider myself the
547,00:37:39.17,00:37:39.17,"cerebral assassin of Survivor. And I'm not going at 100%, I'm"
548,00:37:43.67,00:37:43.67,"not playing. So, you know, to go out on my"
549,00:37:46.20,00:37:46.20,"own terms, I kind of protected the legacy of Jonny Fairplay."
550,00:37:48.30,00:37:48.30,"So I'm very happy with that. >> Oh, Mary."
551,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,Didn't really know Mary. >> That's probably the worst
552,00:38:00.80,00:38:00.80,"thing that could ever happen to somebody on Survivor, is being"
553,00:38:03.13,00:38:03.13,one of the first people voted out of your tribe.
554,00:38:05.47,00:38:05.47,"Maybe I was a strong player and they saw me as a threat, but I"
555,00:38:08.40,00:38:08.40,"really felt like just a ton of bricks hit me, and game over."
556,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,>> Yau-Man. Cirie's fiercest competitor.
557,00:38:18.07,00:38:18.07,>> That's only reason he had to go so early is because he was
558,00:38:20.53,00:38:20.53,such a great player. >> When I first walked in and
559,00:38:23.87,00:38:23.87,"someone said that I'm one of the most likable players, I think"
560,00:38:26.77,00:38:26.77,that pretty much sets me apart as a big target.
561,00:38:31.30,00:38:31.30,"Also, my problem, I know, is that I don't have that, you know"
562,00:38:35.10,00:38:35.10,killer instinct to go up against some of these other people.
563,00:38:38.23,00:38:38.23,"But even though I got voted out so early, it's still quite a fun"
564,00:38:42.93,00:38:42.93,"experience. >> Oh, Mikey."
565,00:38:47.93,00:38:47.93,>> Good old Mikey B. He was a fierce competitor.
566,00:38:51.73,00:38:51.73,>> It hurts. It hurts to get sent home that
567,00:38:55.77,00:38:55.77,"early in the game. I was having fun out there, and"
568,00:38:58.43,00:38:58.43,I just wanted to continue to fight.
569,00:39:00.60,00:39:00.60,But it is a life-changing experience.
570,00:39:03.07,00:39:03.07,And it reminds you that life is good.
571,00:39:08.43,00:39:08.43,>> Joel. The big guy.
572,00:39:12.30,00:39:12.30,>> Truck was pretty intense. >> That's exactly the words
573,00:39:15.67,00:39:15.67,I was going to use. He was intense.
574,00:39:21.37,00:39:21.37,">> I went in with the goal to play the game hard, and I feel"
575,00:39:23.90,00:39:23.90,like I did that. But my Survivor experience
576,00:39:27.10,00:39:27.10,should be summed up as failure. My goal was to be there at the
577,00:39:30.67,00:39:30.67,end. And I didn't reach the goal.
578,00:39:33.50,00:39:33.50,"I failed. >> Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan."
579,00:39:38.27,00:39:38.27,">> Jonathan is a smooth talker. He was tough, though, in this"
580,00:39:41.40,00:39:41.40,"game, man. I give him props."
581,00:39:43.37,00:39:43.37,">> Yeah, he wouldn't have quit for anything."
582,00:39:45.33,00:39:45.33,>> Nothing. >> If he hadn't been taken out
583,00:39:47.10,00:39:47.10,"on medical, he never would have quit."
584,00:39:48.83,00:39:48.83,>> That's so sad. >> Leaving the game for medical
585,00:39:52.97,00:39:52.97,"reasons, I was able to leave with my head held high, no"
586,00:39:57.47,00:39:57.47,"animosity towards anyone, and there's nothing that I could"
587,00:40:01.27,00:40:01.27,have done about it. It is something extremely
588,00:40:04.03,00:40:04.03,"special, and I'll always hold this near and dear, and this is"
589,00:40:06.60,00:40:06.60,a once-in-a-lifetime experience I got to do twice.
590,00:40:12.27,00:40:12.27,">> Oh, Chet! >> My buddy."
591,00:40:16.07,00:40:16.07,">> You know, I have to say the chickens have not been the same"
592,00:40:19.27,00:40:19.27,since Chet left. >> My Survivor experience was
593,00:40:24.30,00:40:24.30,something I only dreamt of happening.
594,00:40:27.10,00:40:27.10,Even though I was told I was going out first I went out
595,00:40:29.77,00:40:29.77,"seventh in a beautiful way, as far as I'm concerned."
596,00:40:32.60,00:40:32.60,"Everybody who was praised for their strength, praised for"
597,00:40:35.77,00:40:35.77,"their agility, praised for their athletic ability, I outlasted"
598,00:40:40.33,00:40:40.33,them. >> I loved Kathy.
599,00:40:44.23,00:40:44.23,>> She was... >> She was a colorful character.
600,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,">> Yeah, to say the least. >> I am in awe of every person"
601,00:40:54.70,00:40:54.70,who's ever played the game of Survivor.
602,00:40:58.10,00:40:58.10,It's the most difficult thing I've ever done.
603,00:41:01.47,00:41:01.47,"Childbirth, I thought that was tough."
604,00:41:03.80,00:41:03.80,Nah. I'd rather whip out eight more
605,00:41:06.03,00:41:06.03,kids in ten minutes than ever do this again.
606,00:41:08.10,00:41:08.10,That's how much harder Survivor is.
607,00:41:11.80,00:41:11.80,">> Oh, Tracy. >> She was... you know, I think"
608,00:41:17.30,00:41:17.30,she was underestimated in this game as a physical competitor.
609,00:41:19.90,00:41:19.90,">> Even if it's 20 days, 20 days may seem like not a lot of time"
610,00:41:24.63,00:41:24.63,"to a lot of people, but when the rain is hitting you for nine and"
611,00:41:27.23,00:41:27.23,"a half hours, you just can't be that same person any longer"
612,00:41:29.60,00:41:29.60,because you have just you and the elements.
613,00:41:32.47,00:41:32.47,I am not the same person any longer.
614,00:41:35.70,00:41:35.70,And I don't think I ever want to be again.
615,00:41:47.40,00:41:47.40,">> Ami, Ami, Ami. >> You know, I loved Ami."
616,00:41:51.33,00:41:51.33,">> I did, too. Ami loved everyone."
617,00:41:54.80,00:41:54.80,">> This game, I was so much more sensitive than I was the first"
618,00:41:58.40,00:41:58.40,game. I've learned the balance for me
619,00:42:02.13,00:42:02.13,of vulnerability and strength. Of walking into a situation and
620,00:42:06.27,00:42:06.27,"being strong with who I am, and knowing that I don't need the"
621,00:42:08.93,00:42:08.93,feedback of other people to know I'm okay with who I am.
622,00:42:15.37,00:42:15.37,">> Oh, Eliza. My arch rival that I had to"
623,00:42:19.43,00:42:19.43,compete with for 22 days. >> Wow.
624,00:42:23.00,00:42:23.00,>> Wow. >> Eliza put up a good fight in
625,00:42:24.73,00:42:24.73,"this game. >> Oh, yeah."
626,00:42:26.30,00:42:26.30,The last tribal council... >> She went down...
627,00:42:27.93,00:42:27.93,>> She went down swinging. >> ...in a blaze of glory.
628,00:42:29.70,00:42:29.70,">> Yes, she did. >> I was the underdog."
629,00:42:32.80,00:42:32.80,"I was on the outs almost from the start, because I didn't"
630,00:42:37.23,00:42:37.23,really have an alliance with anyone.
631,00:42:39.87,00:42:39.87,"And so I knew that I was on the bottom, and trying to work every"
632,00:42:43.17,00:42:43.17,"angle, which is my game, which is the only game I know how to"
633,00:42:45.43,00:42:45.43,play. And I think I did a good job.
634,00:42:50.93,00:42:50.93,>> Ozzy! >> Ozzy!
635,00:42:52.87,00:42:52.87,">> Oh, Oz! >> I think he's the most well-"
636,00:42:55.03,00:42:55.03,rounded player ever in Survivor. >> And you like him.
637,00:42:59.87,00:42:59.87,>> That's why he had to go. >> You can carry his torch.
638,00:43:02.87,00:43:02.87,"I'll let you carry it. >> To a certain point, your time"
639,00:43:07.53,00:43:07.53,out in Survivor does define you to a large degree.
640,00:43:11.07,00:43:11.07,It's like a chance to really search your soul and get to know
641,00:43:14.30,00:43:14.30,"who you are, and what you're made of."
642,00:43:16.57,00:43:16.57,I knew that I had to trust people this time around to make
643,00:43:18.77,00:43:18.77,"it anywhere, and that was what ended up being my downfall."
644,00:43:23.50,00:43:23.50,But my relationship with Amanda was worth more to me than any
645,00:43:26.73,00:43:26.73,amount of money. >> Good old Jason.
646,00:43:32.87,00:43:32.87,">> He gave Ozzy a ride for his money, too."
647,00:43:36.20,00:43:36.20,>> He beat Ozzy twice. >> I came out here as a strong
648,00:43:42.17,00:43:42.17,"competitor and a good provider, and nobody really saw that"
649,00:43:46.97,00:43:46.97,because I think everybody was just focused on Ozzy.
650,00:43:49.57,00:43:49.57,So it's a bit comforting knowing that Ozzy and I both went out in
651,00:43:53.03,00:43:53.03,the same way. It shows that I'm just as good
652,00:43:55.87,00:43:55.87,of a competitor and provider as Ozzy.
653,00:44:04.17,00:44:04.17,">> Oh, James, my little cuddle bug."
654,00:44:06.63,00:44:06.63,">> He was honest. >> Yeah, he was a straight"
655,00:44:09.10,00:44:09.10,shooter. >> I'd much rather have been
656,00:44:11.30,00:44:11.30,"voted out, because it's like, closure."
657,00:44:14.60,00:44:14.60,"With a finger injury, it kills me."
658,00:44:18.30,00:44:18.30,But the trials I had to go through with them girls really
659,00:44:20.80,00:44:20.80,"was quite a test. I mean, I'm not a bully, but I"
660,00:44:23.07,00:44:23.07,surely don't like anybody telling me what to do.
661,00:44:25.33,00:44:25.33,"So, I mean, I really had to let go and go within myself to calm"
662,00:44:29.07,00:44:29.07,down. >> Alexis.
663,00:44:33.80,00:44:33.80,">> Alexis. >> You know, if, Alexis made it"
664,00:44:36.87,00:44:36.87,"this far, she would definitely be hard to beat."
665,00:44:39.93,00:44:39.93,">> Yeah, Alexis was a charmer. >> Yes, definitely."
666,00:44:44.83,00:44:44.83,">> I felt like I always had this kind of split between, like, the"
667,00:44:47.97,00:44:47.97,"super-competitive tomboy, but then the super-nice southern"
668,00:44:50.43,00:44:50.43,"hospitality girl. So in a weird way, I feel like I"
669,00:44:53.63,00:44:53.63,came into this game a little girl and I got to grow up and
670,00:44:57.03,00:44:57.03,left a woman. >> Poor Erik.
671,00:45:01.73,00:45:01.73,I'm sorry he had to be the victim of the women's wrath.
672,00:45:07.03,00:45:07.03,"But play with fire, you'll get burned."
673,00:45:10.40,00:45:10.40,>> I don't think you can play this game without changing as a
674,00:45:14.50,00:45:14.50,"person. I mean, I've seen so much in so"
675,00:45:17.73,00:45:17.73,"few days that I've never, ever seen in my life."
676,00:45:20.47,00:45:20.47,"I've seen these women here, and they are vicious."
677,00:45:22.73,00:45:22.73,"I mean, they are cutthroat. They are very tough, and there's"
678,00:45:25.23,00:45:25.23,a lot of strength in them. And it's opened my eyes a little
679,00:45:27.80,00:45:27.80,bit about the way that women are and the way that they operate.
680,00:45:33.87,00:45:33.87,>> Natalie. >> Aww.
681,00:45:36.77,00:45:36.77,"The last fan in Survivor. >> Good on you, girl."
682,00:45:38.90,00:45:38.90,">> Good on you, baby. >> If the woman has the"
683,00:45:43.20,00:45:43.20,"opportunity to think, she will outwit a man."
684,00:45:46.50,00:45:46.50,"They may outbrawn a woman, but a woman will definitely outwit a"
685,00:45:51.27,00:45:51.27,"man, hands down, every time. I think I learned a lot about"
686,00:45:54.30,00:45:54.30,"myself, and right now, I'm kind of my biggest fan."
687,00:47:10.20,00:47:10.20,>> JEFF: Welcome to your final immunity challenge.
688,00:47:12.77,00:47:12.77,You ready to get to it? >> Yes.
689,00:47:14.73,00:47:14.73,">> JEFF: All right, Amanda, I'm take back the necklace."
690,00:47:25.27,00:47:25.27,"For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
691,00:47:28.50,00:47:28.50,"For today's immunity challenge, you each have a long wooden"
692,00:47:31.90,00:47:31.90,cylinder that has been cut into several pieces.
693,00:47:35.10,00:47:35.10,In the center is a slot on which rests a metal ball.
694,00:47:38.73,00:47:38.73,"On go, you'll pick up the first piece using two handles,"
695,00:47:43.03,00:47:43.03,"balancing the ball. Every five minutes, as the"
696,00:47:46.00,00:47:46.00,"challenge continues, you will add more pieces, making it more"
697,00:47:49.07,00:47:49.07,"difficult to hold on to. If at any point the ball drops,"
698,00:47:54.37,00:47:54.37,you're out of the challenge. Last person left standing wins
699,00:47:57.90,00:47:57.90,"immunity, is guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council,"
700,00:48:03.70,00:48:03.70,where you will get a chance to convince the jury you're worthy
701,00:48:07.03,00:48:07.03,of a million dollars. Also at tonight's tribal council
702,00:48:10.30,00:48:10.30,"you will, in effect, be deciding who you want to sit next to you"
703,00:48:14.67,00:48:14.67,at that final tribal. A very big decision.
704,00:48:18.23,00:48:18.23,This is potentially a million- dollar challenge.
705,00:48:22.33,00:48:22.33,"Shall we get to it? All right, everybody pick up"
706,00:48:24.80,00:48:24.80,your handles. Five seconds that I count you
707,00:48:28.63,00:48:28.63,"down, that is your grace period. Use these five seconds as free"
708,00:48:33.30,00:48:33.30,time to get your bearings. When we get to one is when we
709,00:48:36.03,00:48:36.03,go. Everybody's picked up their
710,00:48:40.13,00:48:40.13,"handles, got your first piece in place."
711,00:48:43.03,00:48:43.03,"Five, four, three, two, one. This challenge is officially on."
712,00:48:52.03,00:48:52.03,"We'll go five minutes before we start adding more pieces, and"
713,00:48:56.80,00:48:56.80,"when we do, it will become much more difficult."
714,00:49:08.87,00:49:08.87,"The slightest lapse in concentration, and you will be"
715,00:49:11.67,00:49:11.67,out of this challenge. You have to constantly check in
716,00:49:16.13,00:49:16.13,with yourself and make sure you are staying focused.
717,00:49:22.63,00:49:22.63,"All right, this round is over. You can set them down."
718,00:49:26.87,00:49:26.87,"You are safe. All right, let's add two more"
719,00:49:32.30,00:49:32.30,"pieces, making this cylinder a little longer, a little more"
720,00:49:38.33,00:49:38.33,difficult to hold. Everybody grab your handles.
721,00:49:41.53,00:49:41.53,Here we go. Everybody lift.
722,00:49:45.43,00:49:45.43,"Five, four, three, two, one. We are on."
723,00:49:54.10,00:49:54.10,Everybody now holding three pieces.
724,00:49:57.83,00:49:57.83,Concentrate. All of your energy should be
725,00:50:00.80,00:50:00.80,focused on keeping that ball stable.
726,00:50:05.27,00:50:05.27,"You drop this ball, it could cost you a million dollars."
727,00:50:14.57,00:50:14.57,One more minute left in this round.
728,00:50:16.67,00:50:16.67,You can do it. Hang in there.
729,00:50:18.80,00:50:18.80,Don't blow it now. Last 15 seconds in this round.
730,00:50:24.93,00:50:24.93,"Five, four, three, two, one. This round is over."
731,00:50:32.70,00:50:32.70,You're safe. Set it down.
732,00:50:34.80,00:50:34.80,"Nice work. All right, let's add two more"
733,00:50:37.70,00:50:37.70,pieces. Now it's going to get
734,00:50:42.60,00:50:42.60,interesting. Everybody pick up your handles.
735,00:50:45.53,00:50:45.53,"Five, four, three, two, one. This round is on."
736,00:50:53.20,00:50:53.20,"After 38 days of playing this game together as a team, nowhere"
737,00:50:57.80,00:50:57.80,"left to hide. Now, instead of working"
738,00:51:00.73,00:51:00.73,"together, you have to battle against each other with only one"
739,00:51:04.20,00:51:04.20,goal-- beat the other two. Parvati drops her ball.
740,00:51:16.80,00:51:16.80,Parvati is the first person out of this challenge.
741,00:51:19.60,00:51:19.60,Parvati's fate is no longer in her own hands.
742,00:51:25.63,00:51:25.63,We are now down to Cirie and Amanda.
743,00:51:30.03,00:51:30.03,"15 seconds left in this round. Five, four, three, two, one."
744,00:51:39.07,00:51:39.07,This round is over. Set it down.
745,00:51:41.30,00:51:41.30,"You are safe. >> Oh, my god."
746,00:51:46.50,00:51:46.50,">> JEFF: All right, next round. Let's add two more pieces."
747,00:51:52.00,00:51:52.00,"Every time you add pieces, it gets more difficult."
748,00:51:55.60,00:51:55.60,Let's put your handles up. This could be the round that
749,00:51:58.93,00:51:58.93,decides it all. Here we go.
750,00:52:04.47,00:52:04.47,"Five, four, three, two... Cirie drops."
751,00:52:08.77,00:52:08.77,"If it falls off while I'm still counting, we reset."
752,00:52:11.77,00:52:11.77,Take your time when you're lifting it up.
753,00:52:13.70,00:52:13.70,"It's not a race. Here we go, five, four, three,"
754,00:52:18.47,00:52:18.47,"two, one. Challenge is back on."
755,00:52:23.43,00:52:23.43,Amanda going underhand this time.
756,00:52:27.77,00:52:27.77,Cirie sticking with the same grip.
757,00:52:30.23,00:52:30.23,"Wherever you're holding it, do not move it."
758,00:52:33.07,00:52:33.07,Hold that ball steady if you want a shot at a million bucks.
759,00:52:36.07,00:52:36.07,You have very little wiggle room.
760,00:52:42.97,00:52:42.97,"30 more seconds, and you move on to the last round."
761,00:52:46.93,00:52:46.93,"Five, four, three, two, one. This round is over."
762,00:52:54.37,00:52:54.37,You're safe. Set it down.
763,00:52:56.87,00:52:56.87,All right. Last and final round.
764,00:53:02.37,00:53:02.37,Add the last two pieces. Pick up your handles.
765,00:53:08.63,00:53:08.63,This round will go until somebody drops their ball.
766,00:53:15.20,00:53:15.20,"Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one."
767,00:53:22.20,00:53:22.20,We are back on. This is the final round of this
768,00:53:25.80,00:53:25.80,challenge. Everything you have inside you
769,00:53:36.17,00:53:36.17,should be focused on keeping that ball stable.
770,00:53:40.53,00:53:40.53,"The person left standing after this, immunity."
771,00:53:45.53,00:53:45.53,"Shot at a million bucks. You lose this challenge, your"
772,00:53:48.70,00:53:48.70,fate is not in your hands. Cirie loses her concentration.
773,00:54:02.13,00:54:02.13,Amanda wins final immunity and is guaranteed a spot at the
774,00:54:06.83,00:54:06.83,"final tribal council. >> Good job, babies."
775,00:54:12.43,00:54:12.43,You're awesome. >> Thank you.
776,00:54:14.87,00:54:14.87,>> Good job. You're awesome.
777,00:54:17.17,00:54:17.17,">> I love you guys. >> JEFF: Amanda, come on over."
778,00:54:22.63,00:54:22.63,No better time to have this than right now.
779,00:54:28.23,00:54:28.23,">> Yep. >> JEFF: With this, you are"
780,00:54:31.40,00:54:31.40,guaranteed a spot at the final tribal council.
781,00:54:34.00,00:54:34.00,You will get a chance to convince the jury you are worthy
782,00:54:36.10,00:54:36.10,"of a million bucks. At tonight's tribal council, you"
783,00:54:38.57,00:54:38.57,"will cast a vote, and in doing so, you will vote either Parvati"
784,00:54:41.57,00:54:41.57,or Cirie out of the game. The other person you're going to
785,00:54:44.43,00:54:44.43,take with you to the final tribal.
786,00:54:46.53,00:54:46.53,"Big, big decision. Have a fun afternoon."
787,00:54:49.07,00:54:49.07,Head back to camp. I will see you guys at tribal.
788,00:55:10.87,00:55:10.87,">> Oh, Gloria. >> She likes it here."
789,00:55:16.40,00:55:16.40,She likes the coop. >> Yeah.
790,00:55:23.47,00:55:23.47,"We just got back from the last immunity challenge, and I won"
791,00:55:26.70,00:55:26.70,immunity. So I'm going to the final two.
792,00:55:29.47,00:55:29.47,And it's either Parvati or Cirie going home tonight.
793,00:55:33.63,00:55:33.63,"Honestly, this is the hardest decision I've had to make this"
794,00:55:36.63,00:55:36.63,"whole game, because, you know, we're each close."
795,00:55:39.57,00:55:39.57,All of us are close. So who do you send home?
796,00:55:42.40,00:55:42.40,>> I don't know what happened. I must have blinked.
797,00:55:46.33,00:55:46.33,>> And it just fell? >> Mm-hmm.
798,00:55:53.10,00:55:53.10,">> She's a closer, that one, you know?"
799,00:55:55.80,00:55:55.80,>> I thought for sure that I could win this one.
800,00:56:00.60,00:56:00.60,"Because during surgeries, you have to hold, like, retractors"
801,00:56:05.37,00:56:05.37,"or instrumentation, and you can't really move."
802,00:56:09.03,00:56:09.03,"If you move, somebody might get hurt."
803,00:56:11.77,00:56:11.77,"Unfortunately, Amanda won. And since Parv and Amanda are so"
804,00:56:15.50,00:56:15.50,"buddy-buddy, unless something happens, I'm probably going home"
805,00:56:18.77,00:56:18.77,"tonight. >> This is my decision, pretty"
806,00:56:32.10,00:56:32.10,much. >> I know.
807,00:56:34.13,00:56:34.13,"We're not even voting, I don't think."
808,00:56:35.93,00:56:35.93,">> No, I am. Me."
809,00:56:37.63,00:56:37.63,>> Yeah. >> That sucks.
810,00:56:39.40,00:56:39.40,">> I know. I mean, she understands."
811,00:56:46.70,00:56:46.70,My fate is pretty much in Amanda's hands right now.
812,00:56:49.53,00:56:49.53,But I'm fairly confident that she's going to take me to the
813,00:56:52.73,00:56:52.73,final two with her. We've had an alliance since day
814,00:56:55.23,00:56:55.23,one out here. And we also have a really tight
815,00:56:58.47,00:56:58.47,"relationship, Amanda and I, that's developed over the course"
816,00:57:00.73,00:57:00.73,"of this game. So I'm not worried about it,"
817,00:57:03.23,00:57:03.23,"really. This is good, because then"
818,00:57:05.63,00:57:05.63,"tomorrow we can just help each other with our opening speeches,"
819,00:57:07.73,00:57:07.73,just question each other and hang out.
820,00:57:09.67,00:57:09.67,"Oh, today was awful, though. >> Well, you've been handling"
821,00:57:17.70,00:57:17.70,"all these situations really gracefully, you know."
822,00:57:19.80,00:57:19.80,">> Well, I already knew, like, if I didn't win that she'd take"
823,00:57:23.30,00:57:23.30,"you, so it's not like... >> She pissed way more people"
824,00:57:28.17,00:57:28.17,"off than I did. >> Yeah, actually, huh?"
825,00:57:31.47,00:57:31.47,>> Yeah. >> This is such a nightmare that
826,00:57:45.90,00:57:45.90,this happened today. I can't even believe that... how
827,00:57:49.70,00:57:49.70,do I make the decision? What do I go by?
828,00:57:53.10,00:57:53.10,">> I don't know. >> It's, like, the hardest thing"
829,00:57:56.00,00:57:56.00,I've ever had to do. >> Yeah.
830,00:57:59.20,00:57:59.20,>> Parvati and Cirie both deserve to be here.
831,00:58:01.50,00:58:01.50,They both want to be here. So I honestly don't know what to
832,00:58:04.23,00:58:04.23,do. I have a really good personal
833,00:58:06.83,00:58:06.83,"relationship with Parvati, so I feel more loyal to Parvati."
834,00:58:10.70,00:58:10.70,>> I feel like your best shot with the jury is taking me over
835,00:58:15.60,00:58:15.60,"Parv. Every person she screwed over, I"
836,00:58:18.53,00:58:18.53,screwed over. We did everything together.
837,00:58:21.17,00:58:21.17,Every blindside we orchestrated together.
838,00:58:24.83,00:58:24.83,Most of them I did most of the talking for.
839,00:58:29.93,00:58:29.93,">> So how is... >> Yeah, but that's only if the"
840,00:58:38.03,00:58:38.03,people are willing to listen. These are the people I screwed
841,00:58:41.60,00:58:41.60,over I would have to talk to. >> Cirie has pissed a lot of
842,00:58:45.23,00:58:45.23,people off on the jury. Probably more than Parvati.
843,00:58:48.90,00:58:48.90,But Cirie is a hell of a speaker.
844,00:58:51.90,00:58:51.90,She can convince anyone to do anything.
845,00:58:55.07,00:58:55.07,"And in the final tribal council, she could convince the jury to"
846,00:58:57.87,00:58:57.87,"give her the million dollars. So, I mean, it's kind of a"
847,00:59:00.87,00:59:00.87,catch-22. >> It should be interesting.
848,00:59:09.60,00:59:09.60,>> Making this decision tonight is killing me.
849,00:59:12.03,00:59:12.03,"You kind of have to just go with how you feel, and a gut feeling."
850,00:59:14.50,00:59:14.50,"And I've been going with my gut this whole game, and it's gotten"
851,00:59:16.87,00:59:16.87,"me this far, but I know that this decision could cost me the"
852,00:59:19.33,00:59:19.33,million dollars. >> JEFF: We'll now bring in the
853,00:59:41.60,00:59:41.60,"members of our jury. Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,"
854,00:59:48.17,00:59:48.17,"Alexis, Erik, and Natalie, voted out at the last tribal council."
855,00:59:56.00,00:59:56.00,"Well, after 38 days, we've reached a point where there is"
856,01:00:00.73,01:00:00.73,only one decision left to be made before we turn this game
857,01:00:04.37,01:00:04.37,"over to the jury. And that is, who's going to that"
858,01:00:07.80,01:00:07.80,"final tribal council? Amanda, after winning today's"
859,01:00:10.70,01:00:10.70,"immunity challenge, you are in total control."
860,01:00:13.90,01:00:13.90,">> I know. >> JEFF: Tough decision, in a"
861,01:00:16.37,01:00:16.37,way. You guys have been together
862,01:00:18.50,01:00:18.50,almost from the beginning. >> Yeah.
863,01:00:21.23,01:00:21.23,"I mean, winning immunity today was a blessing and a curse at"
864,01:00:24.20,01:00:24.20,"the same time. You know, it's a blessing"
865,01:00:27.43,01:00:27.43,"because I'm guaranteed the final two, and it's a curse because I"
866,01:00:31.33,01:00:31.33,"have to choose who goes with me. And we're so close, it's..."
867,01:00:36.67,01:00:36.67,"It's just a hard, hard decision. >> JEFF: Cirie, do you buy that"
868,01:00:43.00,01:00:43.00,it's difficult for Amanda? >> Yeah.
869,01:00:46.63,01:00:46.63,"I believe it's difficult for Amanda, because we have been"
870,01:00:49.97,01:00:49.97,"together since day one. Amanda, Parvati, and myself, we"
871,01:00:53.23,01:00:53.23,"kind of decided, you know, it should be us three 'til the end."
872,01:00:56.90,01:00:56.90,And it pretty much has been that.
873,01:01:00.80,01:01:00.80,">> JEFF: Parvati, difficult to not have any say at this point?"
874,01:01:04.27,01:01:04.27,>> I honestly don't envy Amanda's position at all right
875,01:01:08.40,01:01:08.40,"now. I mean, she has a hard decision"
876,01:01:10.97,01:01:10.97,to make. We have all been protecting each
877,01:01:13.80,01:01:13.80,"other through blindside after blindside, weathering storms"
878,01:01:16.30,01:01:16.30,"together, and I don't think it is going to be an easy decision,"
879,01:01:19.70,01:01:19.70,and I wouldn't want to be making it.
880,01:01:21.97,01:01:21.97,">> JEFF: So Amanda, take me through both sides of this."
881,01:01:24.27,01:01:24.27,What about bringing Parvati or Cirie to the end is risky?
882,01:01:28.43,01:01:28.43,">> You know, with these girls it's a tossup at this point."
883,01:01:32.40,01:01:32.40,"Strategy-wise, Cirie is a great talker."
884,01:01:36.07,01:01:36.07,She can convince pretty much anyone to do anything.
885,01:01:39.30,01:01:39.30,"And, you know, that's a threat at the end of the game."
886,01:01:43.47,01:01:43.47,And Parvati has played a very social game.
887,01:01:46.80,01:01:46.80,She has made personal relationships on the jury that I
888,01:01:49.33,01:01:49.33,think will definitely come into play at the final tribal
889,01:01:51.97,01:01:51.97,"council. So it was a hard decision, but I"
890,01:01:55.00,01:01:55.00,ultimately made a decision on my gut feeling.
891,01:01:58.50,01:01:58.50,>> JEFF: Take me through the mixed emotions that have to be
892,01:02:01.80,01:02:01.80,"going through your head-- the joy of knowing ""I succeeded,"
893,01:02:06.60,01:02:06.60,I am going to be at the final tribal after 39 days of
894,01:02:10.00,01:02:10.00,"working,"" and the pain of having to vote somebody out that you've"
895,01:02:14.53,01:02:14.53,been with from the beginning. >> Yeah.
896,01:02:18.10,01:02:18.10,">> That's okay. >> It's just really hard for me,"
897,01:02:24.63,01:02:24.63,"because I feel like either way, it's a lose-lose situation for"
898,01:02:28.93,01:02:28.93,"me at this point. I mean, if I go with Cirie, I'm"
899,01:02:31.33,01:02:31.33,"hurts Parvati. If I go with Parvati, I'm"
900,01:02:33.70,01:02:33.70,hurting Cirie. I know that this vote tonight is
901,01:02:36.80,01:02:36.80,going to hurt someone's feelings.
902,01:02:38.97,01:02:38.97,And I'm just having a hard time with that.
903,01:02:43.20,01:02:43.20,">> JEFF: All right, let's get to the vote."
904,01:02:47.53,01:02:47.53,"Amanda, since you have immunity, nobody can vote for you."
905,01:02:50.80,01:02:50.80,That means Cirie can only vote for Parvati.
906,01:02:54.00,01:02:54.00,"Parvati can only vote for Cirie. Parvati and Cirie, you won't"
907,01:02:57.77,01:02:57.77,vote tonight. The only person voting tonight
908,01:03:00.23,01:03:00.23,is Amanda. You'll be voting out the 15th
909,01:03:02.20,01:03:02.20,"person from this game, and you will be deciding who you are"
910,01:03:04.60,01:03:04.60,bringing with you to the final tribal council.
911,01:03:07.23,01:03:07.23,"If you're wrong, it is a million-dollar mistake."
912,01:03:09.97,01:03:09.97,"If you're right, this time tomorrow night, you're a"
913,01:03:12.47,01:03:12.47,millionaire. >> I know.
914,01:03:14.70,01:03:14.70,">> JEFF: It's time to vote. Amanda, you're up."
915,01:03:52.63,01:03:52.63,"I'll go get the vote. Once the votes are read, the"
916,01:04:05.60,01:04:05.60,decision is final. The person voted out will be
917,01:04:07.67,01:04:07.67,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
918,01:04:09.77,01:04:09.77,"I'll read the vote. 15th person voted out, and the"
919,01:04:19.63,01:04:19.63,"eighth and final member of our jury, Cirie."
920,01:04:23.93,01:04:23.93,You need to bring me your torch. >> I'm sorry.
921,01:04:27.50,01:04:27.50,>> It's okay. It's all right.
922,01:04:42.60,01:04:42.60,"Cirie, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
923,01:05:01.57,01:05:01.57,">> JEFF: Parvati, Amanda, you have gone as far as you can go"
924,01:05:05.17,01:05:05.17,in this game. The power now shifts to the
925,01:05:08.20,01:05:08.20,jury. Eight people-- including Cirie--
926,01:05:12.10,01:05:12.10,that you had a hand in voting out now hold your fate in their
927,01:05:15.20,01:05:15.20,hands. You've got one more night.
928,01:05:18.97,01:05:18.97,I hope you can enjoy it. I'll see you both tomorrow night
929,01:05:21.43,01:05:21.43,"for your final tribal council. Grab your torches, head back to"
930,01:05:24.13,01:05:24.13,camp. Good night.
931,01:05:33.30,01:05:33.30,">> Here I am again, coming up just short."
932,01:05:36.53,01:05:36.53,"HB, John, Jamil, Jared, Mom, Dad, sorry."
933,01:05:41.97,01:05:41.97,I tried my hardest. It just wasn't meant to be.
934,01:06:08.47,01:06:08.47,>> We're going home tonight. >> I was so happy when I woke up
935,01:06:15.00,01:06:15.00,today. To finally know that I made it
936,01:06:18.00,01:06:18.00,"to the end, you know, I just kind of, like, breathed and..."
937,01:06:21.67,01:06:21.67,I can't believe we did this. >> I can't believe we're the
938,01:06:25.90,01:06:25.90,last two. >> I know.
939,01:06:27.87,01:06:27.87,Everyone's gone but me and you. >> I know.
940,01:06:30.57,01:06:30.57,>> We bamboozled everyone out of the game.
941,01:06:33.73,01:06:33.73,">> This morning when I woke up, I think the happiness, like,"
942,01:06:36.50,01:06:36.50,"started in my stomach, and it bubbled up, and I couldn't wipe"
943,01:06:38.93,01:06:38.93,the smile off my face. All the hard work has paid off.
944,01:06:41.43,01:06:41.43,"We're here, and it's done, and we're final two."
945,01:06:51.67,01:06:51.67,">> Oh, my god! >> BOTH: Oh..."
946,01:06:54.53,01:06:54.53,my... God.
947,01:06:57.13,01:06:57.13,>> Amanda and I pretty much own this game.
948,01:06:59.30,01:06:59.30,She made it all the way to the end in China.
949,01:07:01.57,01:07:01.57,I made it almost all the way to the end in the Cooks.
950,01:07:05.30,01:07:05.30,"To be in the final two in this season, it's a serious"
951,01:07:07.63,01:07:07.63,"accomplishment, and I feel like I can stand up tall and be like,"
952,01:07:11.13,01:07:11.13,"""I am a survivor."" Oh, my god."
953,01:07:14.20,01:07:14.20,"I am so glad I'm with you. >> I know, me, too!"
954,01:07:16.97,01:07:16.97,There's no other person here I'd rather be here with right now.
955,01:07:19.57,01:07:19.57,">> Me, either. This is, like, the prettiest"
956,01:07:22.37,01:07:22.37,"picnic ever. >> This is, like, a huge"
957,01:07:24.57,01:07:24.57,"accomplishment. Like, this is the biggest"
958,01:07:26.80,01:07:26.80,"accomplishment of my life. >> Mine, too."
959,01:07:28.83,01:07:28.83,>> I feel like we battled every element to get where we are
960,01:07:31.27,01:07:31.27,"right now-- like, every possible thing that we could go through,"
961,01:07:35.57,01:07:35.57,"we've gone through, and we've, like, mastered it, and we've"
962,01:07:38.47,01:07:38.47,"gotten ourselves here. In the past six months, I've"
963,01:07:41.70,01:07:41.70,"been living in the jungle for 78 days, you know, so I don't think"
964,01:07:45.83,01:07:45.83,there's much in real life that I can't handle after
965,01:07:49.07,01:07:49.07,two Survivors in a row. >> We're going to be so good
966,01:07:51.80,01:07:51.80,"tonight at that tribal thing. >> Oh, yeah, we're going to be,"
967,01:07:54.03,01:07:54.03,"like, happy and full and be like, ""Yeah, ask us your"
968,01:07:56.43,01:07:56.43,"questions. Bring it on."""
969,01:07:59.87,01:07:59.87,">> ""Bring it on, bitches."" >> I think it's interesting that"
970,01:08:03.40,01:08:03.40,"me and Parvati are in the end of this game together, because we"
971,01:08:05.73,01:08:05.73,have played completely different games.
972,01:08:08.03,01:08:08.03,"I think I have played this game loyal to my alliances, and"
973,01:08:10.67,01:08:10.67,Parvati pretty much did anything she needed to do to take
974,01:08:13.57,01:08:13.57,"control. And because of that, a lot of"
975,01:08:17.83,01:08:17.83,"people on the jury don't like her, so that could be a benefit"
976,01:08:20.63,01:08:20.63,for me. >> We have had this game in the
977,01:08:23.73,01:08:23.73,palm of our hands since we met. And then the switch-up.
978,01:08:27.60,01:08:27.60,"And then the craziness. And then, still, it's still you"
979,01:08:31.13,01:08:31.13,"and me. I really, honestly, feel so"
980,01:08:35.73,01:08:35.73,relaxed going into the final tribal council.
981,01:08:42.37,01:08:42.37,I feel like I've played a game that's been very true to myself.
982,01:08:45.00,01:08:45.00,I don't feel like I could have played this game better.
983,01:08:47.57,01:08:47.57,>> You want to do the honors? >> Sure.
984,01:08:53.03,01:08:53.03,>> Ah-hah! My game was a lot more
985,01:09:00.47,01:09:00.47,"aggressive than Amanda's game. It was a lot more cutthroat,"
986,01:09:02.73,01:09:02.73,more cold-blooded. I was playing this to win.
987,01:09:08.87,01:09:08.87,>> We're pyromaniacs. >> That's awesome.
988,01:09:13.23,01:09:13.23,I think my strongest point I can make tonight is standing up and
989,01:09:16.50,01:09:16.50,"owning that I have been a powerful, controlling player"
990,01:09:19.67,01:09:19.67,throughout the duration of this game.
991,01:09:36.27,01:09:36.27,">> Parvati has played a cutthroat, aggressive game, and"
992,01:09:39.50,01:09:39.50,"I know that she's going to finish with a cutthroat,"
993,01:09:42.40,01:09:42.40,"aggressive game, and that could be by her throwing me under the"
994,01:09:45.07,01:09:45.07,"bus tonight at tribal. And if that is the case, then I"
995,01:09:48.03,01:09:48.03,am ready to fight for this. I think people will give me
996,01:09:57.70,01:09:57.70,"their votes, because I was loyal to every alliance that I've"
997,01:10:00.00,01:10:00.00,"made. Yeah, the jury makes the"
998,01:10:02.30,01:10:02.30,"decision, but ultimately, it's me and Parvati convincing the"
999,01:10:04.73,01:10:04.73,"jury what to do. Tonight we're going toe to toe,"
1000,01:10:08.20,01:10:08.20,"and one person is going to win a million dollars, and the other"
1001,01:10:10.10,01:10:10.10,"person is going to walk away with nothing, and may the best"
1002,01:10:11.87,01:10:11.87,woman win. >> JEFF: We'll now bring in the
1003,01:10:35.07,01:10:35.07,"members of our jury. Eliza, Ozzy, Jason, James,"
1004,01:10:42.77,01:10:42.77,"Alexis, Erik, Natalie, and Cirie, voted out at the last"
1005,01:10:49.63,01:10:49.63,tribal council. Welcome to your final tribal
1006,01:10:52.63,01:10:52.63,council. Congratulations on outlasting 18
1007,01:10:57.10,01:10:57.10,"other people in this game. Tonight, the power shifts from"
1008,01:11:02.00,01:11:02.00,this side of the tribal council over to the jury.
1009,01:11:06.27,01:11:06.27,Based on what they've seen over the last 39 days and what they
1010,01:11:09.90,01:11:09.90,"hear tonight, the jury will make a million-dollar decision."
1011,01:11:14.67,01:11:14.67,Here's how it's going to work. You will each get a chance to
1012,01:11:17.53,01:11:17.53,make an opening statement. This is your first chance to
1013,01:11:19.93,01:11:19.93,convince this jury why you are deserving of the title of sole
1014,01:11:22.67,01:11:22.67,survivor. The jury will then get their
1015,01:11:25.70,01:11:25.70,first chance to address you. We will then vote.
1016,01:11:32.57,01:11:32.57,"Opening statements. Amanda, you're up."
1017,01:11:40.07,01:11:40.07,">> I came into this game, you know, wanting to do two things."
1018,01:11:42.77,01:11:42.77,"I wanted to play a loyal game, and I wanted to fight"
1019,01:11:46.03,01:11:46.03,"physically, strategically, and mentally to the end."
1020,01:11:48.80,01:11:48.80,"And, you know, I'm really proud of how I played."
1021,01:11:52.03,01:11:52.03,"And I know I wouldn't be sitting here without, you know, help"
1022,01:11:55.00,01:11:55.00,from all of you. So thanks.
1023,01:11:58.43,01:11:58.43,I wanted to say thanks. >> JEFF: Parvati.
1024,01:12:03.53,01:12:03.53,>> I came into this game with a previous reputation from the
1025,01:12:08.60,01:12:08.60,Cook Islands as the flirt. I knew that I had to play so
1026,01:12:13.53,01:12:13.53,much differently than I played in the Cook Islands.
1027,01:12:15.70,01:12:15.70,"Like, I had to play aggressively."
1028,01:12:17.83,01:12:17.83,I had to beat my competition before my competition had a
1029,01:12:20.37,01:12:20.37,chance to beat me. And you gave me a serious run
1030,01:12:23.40,01:12:23.40,"for my money, all of you. So the only thing I could do was"
1031,01:12:31.30,01:12:31.30,"make bold power plays, and with the help of a powerful group of"
1032,01:12:35.37,01:12:35.37,"women, pull off some of the hugest heists in Survivor"
1033,01:12:38.97,01:12:38.97,"history. So ask me anything you want, and"
1034,01:12:43.13,01:12:43.13,"you'll get an honest answer. >> JEFF: All right, jury, in a"
1035,01:12:45.47,01:12:45.47,moment you're going to get your first chance to address Amanda
1036,01:12:47.80,01:12:47.80,and Parvati. I'll give you a moment to think
1037,01:12:50.07,01:12:50.07,"about what you want to say. >> JEFF: All right, jury, it is"
1038,01:13:08.73,01:13:08.73,"now your first opportunity to address Amanda and Parvati,"
1039,01:13:13.53,01:13:13.53,trying to gain the information you need to make a million-
1040,01:13:15.77,01:13:15.77,"dollar decision. Eliza, get us started."
1041,01:13:24.57,01:13:24.57,>> Both of you played a great strategic game.
1042,01:13:26.60,01:13:26.60,"You made moves, and I can respect that."
1043,01:13:29.03,01:13:29.03,But I honestly have no idea who I'm going to vote for tonight.
1044,01:13:32.23,01:13:32.23,"Parvati, all 24 days I spent in this game I spent on the island"
1045,01:13:37.37,01:13:37.37,with you. I think taking out Ozzy was a
1046,01:13:40.30,01:13:40.30,brilliant strategic move. I respect that move that you
1047,01:13:44.17,01:13:44.17,"made. What I can't respect, however,"
1048,01:13:47.90,01:13:47.90,is everything you did that was not necessary for strategic
1049,01:13:51.23,01:13:51.23,advancement in this game. You talked about me behind my
1050,01:13:53.73,01:13:53.73,back. You made fun of me.
1051,01:13:55.77,01:13:55.77,And that is not what got you to the final two.
1052,01:13:58.13,01:13:58.13,It leads me to believe that you might just be a mean person.
1053,01:14:00.53,01:14:00.53,So I'm going to have a lot of difficulty giving you my vote
1054,01:14:02.67,01:14:02.67,"tonight. Amanda, you played a great"
1055,01:14:05.50,01:14:05.50,"strategic game, and it was very impressive."
1056,01:14:09.27,01:14:09.27,"However, listening to you talk literally made me want to kill"
1057,01:14:13.00,01:14:13.00,myself sometimes. I don't know that I can vote for
1058,01:14:15.67,01:14:15.67,someone who I think is so superficial.
1059,01:14:18.73,01:14:18.73,And I'm going to be sitting right there tonight listening to
1060,01:14:21.30,01:14:21.30,"every single thing you both say, because my vote is absolutely"
1061,01:14:24.43,01:14:24.43,not determined. So I hope that I can see some
1062,01:14:26.70,01:14:26.70,genuineness and honesty from you two tonight.
1063,01:14:29.60,01:14:29.60,">> JEFF: Thanks, Eliza. Jason, you're up."
1064,01:14:39.07,01:14:39.07,">> Amanda, when Ozzy was voted out, if you were let in on that"
1065,01:14:43.33,01:14:43.33,"plan, would you have told Ozzy? >> Yes."
1066,01:14:48.57,01:14:48.57,">> And Parv, I've had these misconceptions of you as a"
1067,01:14:55.23,01:14:55.23,"devious, manipulative player. And I just want to know what"
1068,01:14:58.27,01:14:58.27,some of your redeeming qualities have been in the game.
1069,01:15:02.47,01:15:02.47,">> Okay. Well, I think for one, I was"
1070,01:15:06.67,01:15:06.67,"very protective of my alliance with Cirie and Amanda, gave them"
1071,01:15:12.03,01:15:12.03,"my loyalty, and was loyal to them all the way to the end."
1072,01:15:15.50,01:15:15.50,So protectiveness and loyalty to the ladies that I gave my
1073,01:15:21.37,01:15:21.37,loyalty to. We didn't kill Gloria the
1074,01:15:25.03,01:15:25.03,chicken. We saved her life.
1075,01:15:27.80,01:15:27.80,So I'm an animal lover. Is that good enough?
1076,01:15:30.53,01:15:30.53,>> Okay. >> JEFF: Satisfied?
1077,01:15:32.53,01:15:32.53,>> Yeah. Good luck to the both of you.
1078,01:15:34.63,01:15:34.63,">> JEFF: Alexis, you're up. >> My first question is for"
1079,01:15:41.50,01:15:41.50,"Parv. And, obviously, one of the"
1080,01:15:44.77,01:15:44.77,"biggest, most important things to me is how passionate I am"
1081,01:15:47.40,01:15:47.40,about working with young girls. I guess I'm just really curious
1082,01:15:51.07,01:15:51.07,what makes you a better role model than Amanda for young
1083,01:15:54.40,01:15:54.40,girls. >> I don't know if it's better
1084,01:15:57.27,01:15:57.27,or worse. I'm more outspoken than Amanda.
1085,01:15:59.63,01:15:59.63,So I think I'm more independent. I don't like things to be done
1086,01:16:02.60,01:16:02.60,for me. Amanda would go along with the
1087,01:16:05.27,01:16:05.27,"flow, and for me, I think I'm more willing to put myself out"
1088,01:16:08.97,01:16:08.97,there and make bold moves. And I didn't see much of that
1089,01:16:13.03,01:16:13.03,from Amanda. So I guess that's why I feel
1090,01:16:16.30,01:16:16.30,like I would make a better role model.
1091,01:16:18.53,01:16:18.53,">> Thank you. Amanda, I have seen a bunch of"
1092,01:16:21.30,01:16:21.30,Oscar award-winning performances and we couldn't help but be
1093,01:16:27.07,01:16:27.07,laughing when you were crying about sending Cirie home.
1094,01:16:30.50,01:16:30.50,It's not that I'm not sympathetic to it.
1095,01:16:32.53,01:16:32.53,"It's just I think, you know, you cry wolf so many times that,"
1096,01:16:34.43,01:16:34.43,"like, what about, if any, part of your game has been genuine?"
1097,01:16:38.83,01:16:38.83,>> I haven't been faking anything that I've done at
1098,01:16:41.03,01:16:41.03,"tribal. The tears... like, I've only"
1099,01:16:43.50,01:16:43.50,"cried the last tribal council, and that was genuine."
1100,01:16:46.33,01:16:46.33,"Like, that was the hardest decision I've ever had to make."
1101,01:16:48.97,01:16:48.97,I didn't come here trying to get sympathy votes.
1102,01:16:51.57,01:16:51.57,I don't want sympathy votes. >> JEFF: Do you have what you
1103,01:16:54.43,01:16:54.43,need? >> Mm-hmm.
1104,01:16:56.43,01:16:56.43,">> JEFF: Okay. Natalie, you're up."
1105,01:17:06.50,01:17:06.50,">> Ladies. First of all, you have my"
1106,01:17:09.30,01:17:09.30,"respect tonight, woman to woman. I'll start with you, Parv."
1107,01:17:14.57,01:17:14.57,You have labeled yourself as a flirt.
1108,01:17:17.80,01:17:17.80,You're probably the most masterful person in the history
1109,01:17:21.30,01:17:21.30,"of Survivor to play the flirt card, which is great."
1110,01:17:23.83,01:17:23.83,My question to you is how does that resonate for you in the
1111,01:17:28.43,01:17:28.43,bedroom? How do you take that to the next
1112,01:17:32.10,01:17:32.10,level as far as strategy in the game?
1113,01:17:34.97,01:17:34.97,How does that translate your layers of being?
1114,01:17:40.23,01:17:40.23,">> JEFF: Come on, guys. Parvati, do you know what she's"
1115,01:17:42.20,01:17:42.20,asking? >> You're a flirt.
1116,01:17:45.90,01:17:45.90,You flirted with me on several occasions.
1117,01:17:48.23,01:17:48.23,I'm not complaining. >> You're sexy.
1118,01:17:50.43,01:17:50.43,>> Thanks. So how does being the flirt
1119,01:17:54.03,01:17:54.03,parallel to your intimate life? >> I think my strategy in this
1120,01:17:59.80,01:17:59.80,"game has been infused with my personality, and being"
1121,01:18:04.03,01:18:04.03,flirtatious is a big part of my personality.
1122,01:18:06.70,01:18:06.70,"At home, it gets me what I want. I'll flirt with girls to get my"
1123,01:18:14.43,01:18:14.43,"way, or I'll flirt with guys to get my way."
1124,01:18:17.13,01:18:17.13,And I think I honestly can develop genuine relationships
1125,01:18:20.80,01:18:20.80,with people without flirting with them.
1126,01:18:23.07,01:18:23.07,"But it is an old standby, I'm not going to lie."
1127,01:18:25.67,01:18:25.67,">> Okay. Amanda, clearly, you're a"
1128,01:18:29.10,01:18:29.10,beautiful woman. You appear to be a very strong
1129,01:18:32.10,01:18:32.10,"woman. Unfortunately, you always had,"
1130,01:18:36.20,01:18:36.20,"like, a glazed-over look on your face."
1131,01:18:38.60,01:18:38.60,I did notice that. My question to you is was that
1132,01:18:41.40,01:18:41.40,"your strategy to kind of play the zombied pretty girl, not"
1133,01:18:46.33,01:18:46.33,"really knowing what's going on, pageant queen cliche, or is this"
1134,01:18:51.13,01:18:51.13,"who you are as a person? >> No, it's neither."
1135,01:18:55.57,01:18:55.57,"It was neither my strategy, nor do I think that's who I am as a"
1136,01:18:58.37,01:18:58.37,person. I'm a strong woman.
1137,01:19:01.10,01:19:01.10,"I definitely have substance. Sometimes I'm a little reserved,"
1138,01:19:04.03,01:19:04.03,but I definitely think I've made intellectual strategic
1139,01:19:06.87,01:19:06.87,"decisions. And, you know, I want to compete"
1140,01:19:09.43,01:19:09.43,"with the men. Like, I came in this game to"
1141,01:19:11.80,01:19:11.80,compete with the guys. And I don't want anything given
1142,01:19:14.00,01:19:14.00,to me. I came in here to earn
1143,01:19:15.87,01:19:15.87,"everything. >> Okay, thank you both for your"
1144,01:19:17.73,01:19:17.73,"answers. >> JEFF: Thanks, Natalie."
1145,01:19:19.77,01:19:19.77,"Erik, you're up. >> Hi, girls."
1146,01:19:30.87,01:19:30.87,"Let me just start by saying five to six days ago, I would have"
1147,01:19:34.33,01:19:34.33,been 100% voting for Amanda in this situation.
1148,01:19:37.40,01:19:37.40,"I mean, I really respected you, Amanda."
1149,01:19:40.97,01:19:40.97,"And I really thought of you kind of as a big sister, or a cousin."
1150,01:19:45.03,01:19:45.03,"As of late, after seeing certain things, I mean, I'm looking at"
1151,01:19:47.93,01:19:47.93,you right now with a lot of questions.
1152,01:19:51.23,01:19:51.23,"I felt totally burned, totally thrown under the bus at the past"
1153,01:19:54.90,01:19:54.90,two tribal councils that I was there.
1154,01:19:57.77,01:19:57.77,"You pretty much ripped me apart. I mean, on what basis did you"
1155,01:20:01.40,01:20:01.40,"have to just judge me in front of everybody, in front of this"
1156,01:20:03.57,01:20:03.57,jury? >> Okay.
1157,01:20:05.20,01:20:05.20,>> I just want to know that. I really want to know that.
1158,01:20:07.03,01:20:07.03,">> You know, everything I said in tribal council was honest."
1159,01:20:09.40,01:20:09.40,"You were unloyal to me, and you tried to get me voted out, and I"
1160,01:20:11.70,01:20:11.70,was hurt. I wasn't going to sit there and
1161,01:20:14.47,01:20:14.47,let you try to vote me out and just keep my mouth shut.
1162,01:20:17.90,01:20:17.90,"I'm sorry, if I hurt your feelings, but..."
1163,01:20:20.40,01:20:20.40,">> Too late for ""I'm sorries."" I've heard you say that... you"
1164,01:20:23.47,01:20:23.47,said that directly to me at one of the tribal councils.
1165,01:20:25.70,01:20:25.70,"Too little, too late. You said that directly to me."
1166,01:20:28.37,01:20:28.37,"And now you're going to say ""I'm sorry"" to me."
1167,01:20:30.90,01:20:30.90,I really don't buy that at all. >> Okay.
1168,01:20:34.23,01:20:34.23,>> I think I'm good. >> JEFF: Okay.
1169,01:20:39.87,01:20:39.87,James. How's the finger?
1170,01:20:45.17,01:20:45.17,>> The finger's all right. It's good.
1171,01:20:48.10,01:20:48.10,"I mean, I'm not even going to be difficult."
1172,01:20:51.40,01:20:51.40,Amanda pretty much knows she's got it in the bag.
1173,01:20:54.50,01:20:54.50,"The only thing is, Parvati, you fluffed me."
1174,01:20:57.80,01:20:57.80,"You did the great move with Ozzy, and the next day you came"
1175,01:21:00.13,01:21:00.13,up to me with a bunch of fluff. So we're just going to pretend
1176,01:21:03.23,01:21:03.23,"like you didn't say that, have a go again, we reenact it, you"
1177,01:21:06.07,01:21:06.07,"give me a different version. Go on, give it to me, and make"
1178,01:21:09.03,01:21:09.03,"it believable. >> Ha, ha, got you, sucker."
1179,01:21:11.47,01:21:11.47,What? >> That's not it.
1180,01:21:14.30,01:21:14.30,Try a little bit harder. >> That is what you wanted me to
1181,01:21:16.03,01:21:16.03,"say. >> No, that's not what I wanted."
1182,01:21:17.60,01:21:17.60,>> That's exactly what you said you wanted me to say.
1183,01:21:19.33,01:21:19.33,">> You're over-exaggerating it. What I wanted, you to just be"
1184,01:21:21.17,01:21:21.17,"honest. ""Hey, I'm playing the game."
1185,01:21:22.87,01:21:22.87,"It's a game."" I mean, when I play the game..."
1186,01:21:24.60,01:21:24.60,>> It is a game. And the game... the motto is
1187,01:21:27.10,01:21:27.10,"""Outplay, outwit, outlast."" >> Exactly."
1188,01:21:29.47,01:21:29.47,>> There was no chance for me to win this game if I stuck with
1189,01:21:32.03,01:21:32.03,"you, and if I stuck with Oz. There was no chance of me"
1190,01:21:35.43,01:21:35.43,sitting here if I stuck with you guys.
1191,01:21:37.67,01:21:37.67,And that's what I felt. I felt like I had to make that
1192,01:21:39.90,01:21:39.90,"move when I made it. It also, you know, gave me a lot"
1193,01:21:42.57,01:21:42.57,of control. And that's what I wanted.
1194,01:21:46.23,01:21:46.23,>> Are you finished? >> Yes.
1195,01:21:49.40,01:21:49.40,">> All right. >> JEFF: Cirie, you're up."
1196,01:21:54.10,01:21:54.10,>> All righty. Congratulations to both of you.
1197,01:22:00.90,01:22:00.90,"I'm going to start with you, Amanda."
1198,01:22:03.93,01:22:03.93,"Being that you had the decision to make, tell me and the jury"
1199,01:22:07.70,01:22:07.70,why Parvati deserves a million dollars more than I do.
1200,01:22:12.87,01:22:12.87,">> Parvati played a very aggressive, bold game."
1201,01:22:17.87,01:22:17.87,"I think she's stood by her game the whole time, and I respect"
1202,01:22:22.17,01:22:22.17,"that about her. >> So in saying that, are you"
1203,01:22:24.83,01:22:24.83,saying you don't respect my game?
1204,01:22:26.87,01:22:26.87,">> No, I respect your game as well."
1205,01:22:28.83,01:22:28.83,I think Parvati made bolder decisions in this game.
1206,01:22:32.13,01:22:32.13,>> Than I did? >> Yes.
1207,01:22:34.37,01:22:34.37,And I think she was kind of the powerhouse in making those
1208,01:22:38.30,01:22:38.30,decisions happen. >> Okay.
1209,01:22:41.00,01:22:41.00,"Parvati, I would like you to tell the jury why I should be"
1210,01:22:48.43,01:22:48.43,"sitting in your seat, and you be over here on the jury."
1211,01:22:51.53,01:22:51.53,>> I think you played a pretty brilliant game.
1212,01:22:54.60,01:22:54.60,"Yours was a little more, you know, under the radar than mine"
1213,01:22:58.63,01:22:58.63,"was, which I think is a great strategy, you know, to get up"
1214,01:23:00.83,01:23:00.83,"here, too. But I can't compete with a"
1215,01:23:03.17,01:23:03.17,mother of three. You have kids.
1216,01:23:05.47,01:23:05.47,You have a family. I don't have that.
1217,01:23:07.97,01:23:07.97,"So based on those two factors, I would say it should have been"
1218,01:23:12.67,01:23:12.67,you right here. Is that good?
1219,01:23:14.73,01:23:14.73,Is that good enough? No?
1220,01:23:16.87,01:23:16.87,>> I'll ponder over here. >> Okay.
1221,01:23:19.47,01:23:19.47,">> Thanks, ladies. Good luck."
1222,01:23:21.47,01:23:21.47,">> Thanks. >> JEFF: Thanks, Cirie."
1223,01:23:24.97,01:23:24.97,"Ozzy, you're up. >> I think I might be the"
1224,01:23:35.83,01:23:35.83,biggest idiot up here. I am truly to the bottom of my
1225,01:23:40.83,01:23:40.83,heart hurt by what you did to me.
1226,01:23:43.77,01:23:43.77,It was a great move. It really was.
1227,01:23:46.77,01:23:46.77,But I never in a million years thought that you could do that
1228,01:23:51.03,01:23:51.03,to me. You put a price on our
1229,01:23:53.73,01:23:53.73,friendship. You threw us away like garbage.
1230,01:23:58.83,01:23:58.83,"You basically said, ""You know what?"
1231,01:24:01.57,01:24:01.57,"You're not quite worth this much money."""
1232,01:24:04.07,01:24:04.07,"And it hurts, you know? It really does hurt."
1233,01:24:07.17,01:24:07.17,And how can you say that you're a role model when you're willing
1234,01:24:10.17,01:24:10.17,to discard a valuable friendship like that?
1235,01:24:13.97,01:24:13.97,A human being. But I don't want words.
1236,01:24:17.80,01:24:17.80,No words at all. I don't want to talk to you.
1237,01:24:25.97,01:24:25.97,"Honestly, the hardest part for me was the fact that you took"
1238,01:24:29.17,01:24:29.17,away 14 days that I could have spent with Amanda.
1239,01:24:44.53,01:24:44.53,"Amanda, when I told you on the beach at one point when you"
1240,01:24:49.70,01:24:49.70,"asked me if I was playing you or not, I told you honestly that"
1241,01:24:52.90,01:24:52.90,I'm not faking it. I'm not faking my feelings for
1242,01:24:56.53,01:24:56.53,"you or anything, no. I really am having feelings that"
1243,01:25:01.40,01:25:01.40,I've never really felt before and have never...
1244,01:25:08.03,01:25:08.03,I honestly feel like I started to fall in love with you.
1245,01:25:13.37,01:25:13.37,And... I don't know. You're just an amazing girl.
1246,01:25:19.57,01:25:19.57,And I really want everybody to know that.
1247,01:25:22.10,01:25:22.10,And I'm glad I didn't win Cook Island so that I could be here
1248,01:25:25.57,01:25:25.57,and have met you. >> Thank you.
1249,01:25:29.43,01:25:29.43,">> And that's it. >> JEFF: All right, jury."
1250,01:25:36.00,01:25:36.00,You've now had your opportunity to address Amanda and Parvati.
1251,01:25:39.97,01:25:39.97,"Certainly, an interesting final tribal council, very emotional"
1252,01:25:45.30,01:25:45.30,at times. Now you have to make a
1253,01:25:49.50,01:25:49.50,million-dollar decision. Who do you vote for to win this
1254,01:25:52.53,01:25:52.53,game? I'm going to give you a moment
1255,01:25:55.20,01:25:55.20,"to think about your vote. >> JEFF: All right, jury, Amanda"
1256,01:26:16.27,01:26:16.27,and Parvati have had their chance to address you.
1257,01:26:19.50,01:26:19.50,You've had your chance to address them.
1258,01:26:21.80,01:26:21.80,Now we get to the vote. Tonight you are voting for a
1259,01:26:24.93,01:26:24.93,winner-- the name of the person you feel most deserving of the
1260,01:26:30.50,01:26:30.50,"title of sole survivor, and the million-dollar check that goes"
1261,01:26:33.73,01:26:33.73,"with it. For the last time, it is time to"
1262,01:26:36.67,01:26:36.67,"vote. Cirie, you're up."
1263,01:26:55.40,01:26:55.40,>> I'm willing to forgive and forget if you're willing to
1264,01:26:58.30,01:26:58.30,forgive and forget. You played a good game.
1265,01:27:13.77,01:27:13.77,">> I love you so much, girl. You absolutely deserve this."
1266,01:27:16.67,01:27:16.67,And I know you're going to do amazing things with this money.
1267,01:27:34.97,01:27:34.97,>> I hope to god that you win. You deserve it a million times
1268,01:27:39.03,01:27:39.03,more than Parvati. And... love you.
1269,01:28:08.63,01:28:08.63,">> Oh, my god. >> JEFF: I'll go get the votes."
1270,01:28:33.17,01:28:33.17,"Amanda, Parvati, jury, thank you for a great season of Survivor."
