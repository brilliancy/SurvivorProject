200,00:09:06.77,00:09:06.77,SO I'M NOT GOING TO BE ALL UPSET WITH THEM VOTING FOR ME.

1194,00:58:08.93,00:58:08.93,I THINK HE'S JUST TRYING TO GET MAMA C'S JURY VOTE.
1195,00:58:11.60,00:58:11.60,BUT HE ALREADY TOLD ME HE WANTS TO BRING ME TO THE END.
1196,00:58:14.30,00:58:14.30,HE'S TRYING THE ACT LIKE HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE ME TO THE
1197,00:58:16.63,00:58:16.63,END BECAUSE HE THINKS IT'S GOING TO BE EASY MONEY.
1198,00:58:19.10,00:58:19.10,>> EVERYTHING WAS SET.
1199,00:58:21.17,00:58:21.17,">> SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT, BUT I FEEL PRETTY"
1200,00:58:24.77,00:58:24.77,CONFIDENT THAT I'M GOING TO BE SITTING PRETTY IN THE TOP THREE.
1201,00:58:30.30,00:58:30.30,">> IF RODNEY LOSES TONIGHT, IT'S POETIC JUSTICE BECAUSE RODNEY"
1202,00:58:35.70,00:58:35.70,THINKS HE'S SMOOTH TALKED HIS WAY ALL THE WAY INTO THE FINAL
1203,00:58:39.27,00:58:39.27,THREE.
1204,00:58:39.97,00:58:39.97,"SO MAYBE I AM MAKING A MILLION DOLLAR WRONG MISTAKE, BUT I"
1205,00:58:43.87,00:58:43.87,WOULD RATHER LOSE TO MAMA C THAN BE THE GUY THAT JUST TOOK TWO
1206,00:58:48.13,00:58:48.13,GOATS TO THE END AND WON.
1207,00:58:53.87,00:58:53.87,">> OH, GOD."
1208,00:59:05.87,00:59:05.87,THIS IS A HUGE NIGHT.
1209,00:59:06.43,00:59:06.43,RIGHT NOW I'M JUST A LITTLE FRUSTRATED.
1210,00:59:09.97,00:59:09.97,I CAN'T DO IT.
1211,00:59:11.37,00:59:11.37,I'M TRYING.
1212,00:59:12.00,00:59:12.00,IT DIDN'T WORK.
1213,00:59:12.90,00:59:12.90,I'VE BEEN HERE FOR TWO HOURS.
1214,00:59:14.43,00:59:14.43,">> HEY, HEY, DO NOT PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN."
1215,00:59:19.17,00:59:19.17,RELAX.
1216,00:59:19.57,00:59:19.57,GET YOUR MIND RIGHT.
1217,00:59:22.37,00:59:22.37,LOOK AT ME.
1218,00:59:23.70,00:59:23.70,YOU ARE STILL IN THIS GAME.
1219,00:59:26.17,00:59:26.17,YOU GOT THIS.
1220,00:59:27.27,00:59:27.27,>> I'VE WORKED MY ASS OFF FOR 38 DAYS.
1221,00:59:31.87,00:59:31.87,"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT COMES DOWN THE TO THIS, BUT BELIEVE ME,"
1222,00:59:35.30,00:59:35.30,"TONIGHT THERE'S GOING TO BE GAME FACE, BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT"
1223,00:59:38.57,00:59:38.57,LOOKING GOOD.
1224,01:00:00.10,01:00:00.10,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.
1225,01:00:04.90,01:00:04.90,"HALI, JOE, JENN, SHIRIN, TYLER, DAN, AND SIERRA VOTED OUT AT THE"

1228,01:00:19.20,01:00:19.20,"FIRST OF ALL, MIKE, CONGRATULATIONS."
1229,01:00:21.40,01:00:21.40,YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO GO TO THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL.
1230,01:00:24.83,01:00:24.83,SO THE DECISION THAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT IS WHO IS GOING TO JOIN
1231,01:00:30.07,01:00:30.07,YOU?
1232,01:00:30.77,01:00:30.77,"WILL, RODNEY OR CAROLYN?"
1233,01:00:32.43,01:00:32.43,"BEFORE WE GET TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT, WILL, TAKE ME"
1234,01:00:35.67,01:00:35.67,BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON.

1237,01:00:43.73,01:00:43.73,WHAT WAS HAPPENING?
1238,01:00:44.90,01:00:44.90,">> IT'S A GAME, BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SENSE OF PRIDE"
1239,01:00:48.23,01:00:48.23,"AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE FOUR WE DID IT."
1240,01:00:50.60,01:00:50.60,WE DID THAT AS A FAMILY AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER.
1241,01:00:53.10,01:00:53.10,WE JUST WANTED TO HAVE THAT GENUINE MOMENT SAYING JOB WELL
1242,01:00:56.37,01:00:56.37,DONE AND LET THE GAMES BEGIN.
1243,01:01:00.63,01:01:00.63,">> Jeff: MIKE, THE CROWNING MOMENT IS WHEN WILL SAID, CAN"

1248,01:01:13.47,01:01:13.47,"SHUNNAL FAMILY, JEFF, BUT IT'S STILL A FAMILY."
1249,01:01:17.53,01:01:17.53,">> Jeff: SO RODNEY, TAKE ME THROUGH WHAT'S HAPPENING"
1250,01:01:20.67,01:01:20.67,TONIGHT.
1251,01:01:20.90,01:01:20.90,IS MIKE THE CENTER IN ALL OF THIS?
1252,01:01:22.80,01:01:22.80,>> NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THERE'S FOUR PEOPLE.
1253,01:01:25.90,01:01:25.90,BUT TODAY MIKE TOLD ME THAT CAROLINE WANTED TO VOTE MY NAME.
1254,01:01:29.30,01:01:29.30,I FEEL LIKE SHE CAUGHT HERSELF IN A PICKLE AND NOW THAT'S WHY
1255,01:01:33.83,01:01:33.83,I'M FEELING SOME TYPE OF WAY RIGHT NOW.
1256,01:01:35.37,01:01:35.37,">> CAROLYN, WHAT DOES RODNEY MEAN YOU GOT YOURSELF IN THE"
1257,01:01:38.80,01:01:38.80,PICKLE?
1258,01:01:39.03,01:01:39.03,>> THERE'S NO JAM.

1260,01:01:42.77,01:01:42.77,MYSELF.
1261,01:01:43.17,01:01:43.17,SO IT'S EITHER RODNEY OR WILL.
1262,01:01:45.37,01:01:45.37,THAT'S KIND OF THE BOTTOM LINE.
1263,01:01:48.33,01:01:48.33,">> Jeff: MIKE, WHERE DO YOU SIT RIGHT NOW?"
1264,01:01:50.10,01:01:50.10,>> LET'S PUT IT ALL ON THE TABLE?
1265,01:01:53.60,01:01:53.60,WHY VOTE FOR MAMA C.
1266,01:01:55.47,01:01:55.47,THEY CALL HER MAMA FOR A REASON.
1267,01:01:57.73,01:01:57.73,A LOT OF THE PEOPLE OVER THERE ARE VERY CLOSE TO HER.
1268,01:02:00.20,01:02:00.20,SHE MAY GET VOTES AT THE END?
1269,01:02:02.30,01:02:02.30,WHY VOTE RODNEY?
1270,01:02:03.47,01:02:03.47,"WELL, HE PLAYED A SOCIAL GAME, BUT AROUND CAMP HE HASN'T PULLED"
1271,01:02:06.80,01:02:06.80,"HIS WEIGHT, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT, IN MY OPINION."
1272,01:02:09.57,01:02:09.57,"BUT THIS GAME IS A FICKLE GAME, JEFF."
1273,01:02:12.97,01:02:12.97,"AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU PULLED YOUR WEIGHT AROUND CAMP,"
1274,01:02:15.87,01:02:15.87,"IF YOU WERE BEST FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY ON THAT JURY, WHAT IT"

1283,01:02:55.73,01:02:55.73,"BUT JUST REMEMBER, THIS GAME IS CUTTHROAT."
1284,01:02:57.40,01:02:57.40,YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.
1285,01:03:11.80,01:03:11.80,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
1286,01:03:20.20,01:03:20.20,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
1287,01:03:22.77,01:03:22.77,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
1288,01:03:25.13,01:03:25.13,COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.

1299,01:04:10.10,01:04:10.10,ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS IN THIS GAME.
1300,01:04:14.60,01:04:14.60,BY DAY 38 YOU SHOULD KNOW HOW TO MAKE FIRE.
1301,01:04:18.03,01:04:18.03,"[LAUGHTER] IF YOU DO, IT COULD BE WORTH $1"
1302,01:04:24.77,01:04:24.77,MILLION.
1303,01:04:43.40,01:04:43.40,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
1304,01:04:43.93,01:04:43.93,HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK.
1305,01:04:45.30,01:04:45.30,YOU BOTH HAVE THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF SUPPLIES.

1310,01:05:01.70,01:05:01.70,THE STAKES DON'T GET ANY BIGGER.
1311,01:05:03.63,01:05:03.63,HIRE -- HERE WE GO.
1312,01:05:06.27,01:05:06.27,THIS CHALLENGE IS ON.
1313,01:05:09.77,01:05:09.77,WHO HAS LEARNED THE BEST METHOD FOR GETTING FIRE THE FASTEST?

1315,01:05:23.47,01:05:23.47,IGNITER.
1316,01:05:23.77,01:05:23.77,THE OTHER APPROACH IS TO USE THE COCONUT HUSK AND TRY TO SPARK IT
1317,01:05:28.83,01:05:28.83,DIRECTLY.
1318,01:05:29.50,01:05:29.50,BOTH APPROACHES CAN WORK.
1319,01:05:33.73,01:05:33.73,CAROLYN NOW TRYING TO SPARK THAT COCONUT HUSK.
1320,01:05:37.23,01:05:37.23,THE MOST FLAMMABLE THING YOU HAVE IS THE HUSK.
1321,01:05:39.70,01:05:39.70,USE IT WISELY.
1322,01:05:41.00,01:05:41.00,"IF YOU RUN OUT, IT BECOMES MUCH MORE DIFFICULT."
1323,01:05:44.97,01:05:44.97,COULD BE A MILLION DOLLAR FIRE YOU ARE BUILDING.
1324,01:06:03.50,01:06:03.50,>> MY FLINT BROKE.
1325,01:06:07.60,01:06:07.60,I GOT HALF A FLINT.
1326,01:06:08.53,01:06:08.53,>> THERE YOU GO.

1334,01:06:46.33,01:06:46.33,STARTED OFF A LITTLE ERRATIC.
1335,01:06:47.97,01:06:47.97,NOW BOTH HAVE SLOWED DOWN.

1337,01:07:01.73,01:07:01.73,>> Jeff: YEP.
1338,01:07:16.03,01:07:16.03,>> THANK YOU.

1345,01:08:07.23,01:08:07.23,RODNEY HAS FLAME.
1346,01:08:08.10,01:08:08.10,CAN HE KEEP IT GOING?
1347,01:08:10.40,01:08:10.40,IT'S FIRST SIGN OF FIRE IN THIS CHALLENGE.

1349,01:08:17.80,01:08:17.80,CAN'T DO IT.
1350,01:08:21.70,01:08:21.70,>> WHAT?

1362,01:09:11.23,01:09:11.23,WHO CAN NOW MAKE A FIRE THAT WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH.
1363,01:09:14.93,01:09:14.93,THAT HUSK BURNS BRIGHT BUT IT BURNS FAST AND WHEN IT'S GONE
1364,01:09:17.87,01:09:17.87,YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

1610,01:22:08.67,01:22:08.67,WHAT I SAW LATE IN THE GAME WAS A GUY WHO WAS PARANOID AND
1611,01:22:13.40,01:22:13.40,LOOKING TO DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS TOUCHING?
1612,01:22:17.27,01:22:17.27,>> REALLY I WANTED TO DO BETTER SOCIALLY THAN I DID.
