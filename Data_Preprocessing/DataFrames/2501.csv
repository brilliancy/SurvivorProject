197,00:13:49.67,00:13:49.67,BREAK WHERE IT'S SCORED. WHAT I WANT IS SOMETHING

237,00:16:14.57,00:16:14.57,WHICH WORKS OUT IN A WAY BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE LEADER SO BAD
238,00:16:17.47,00:16:17.47,AND EVERYTHING HAS TO BE WAY HE WANTS IT DONE.
239,00:16:20.27,00:16:20.27,"SO WHEN HE WAS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY GOT THE FIRE GOING, IN"
240,00:16:22.93,00:16:22.93,A WAY A LITTLE BIT OF A TARGET CAME OFF MY BACK BECAUSE I'M NOT
241,00:16:26.33,00:16:26.33,A THREAT TO HIM. >> RIGHT NOW I THINK THE GAME IS
242,00:16:28.87,00:16:28.87,JUST BE NICE TO RUSSELL AND MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD ABOUT BEING THE
243,00:16:31.77,00:16:31.77,LEADER. >> WHATEVER.
244,00:16:32.47,00:16:32.47,>> WHATEVER. >> I LET HIM BUILD A FIRE.
245,00:16:35.33,00:16:35.33,SO IT'S KIND OF A BLESSING HE'S THE ONE WHO PULLED IT OFF AND
246,00:16:38.77,00:16:38.77,"HE'S ON CLOUD NINE, WHATEVER PLANET HE'S LIVING ON."
247,00:16:56.03,00:16:56.03,>> YEAH! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

249,00:17:05.30,00:17:05.30,>> GOOD JOB. >> WHAT A BOUNTIMENT LET'S GET
250,00:17:08.97,00:17:08.97,EVERYTHING OFF AND THE THREE OF US CAN MAYBE JUST GET IT UP
251,00:17:12.47,00:17:12.47,ABOVE THIS TIDELINE. >> I THINK I LEFT MY KNEE AT THE
252,00:17:15.30,00:17:15.30,"BOAT GETTING OFF. WE LAUNCHED THAT BOAT, I WAS"
253,00:17:17.03,00:17:17.03,TRYING TO HOLD OUR GEAR ON THE BOAT ITSELF AND MY LEG GOT STUCK
254,00:17:20.30,00:17:20.30,AND I GOT FLIPPED OVER AND-- I'VE PLAYED HURT MY WHOLE
255,00:17:24.53,00:17:24.53,CAREER. I'VE HAD SURGERIES ON MY KNEES.
256,00:17:26.77,00:17:26.77,"GETTING ON THIS SAND AND WALKING AROUND RIGHT NOW, MY KNEE WANTS"
257,00:17:29.90,00:17:29.90,TO BUCKLE ON THE INSIDE. SO I AIN'T-- IT JUST DID IT
258,00:17:34.70,00:17:34.70,AGAIN. I AIN'T FEELING TOO GOOD.
259,00:17:37.43,00:17:37.43,THAT MEDIAL LIGAMENT I THINK IS HURT.
260,00:17:39.83,00:17:39.83,YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW I'M
261,00:17:42.63,00:17:42.63,HURT. I'M TRYING TO PLAY IT OFF AS
262,00:17:43.97,00:17:43.97,BEST I CAN FOR NOW. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING?
263,00:17:45.73,00:17:45.73,>> GOOD. >> WHAT ARE WE THINKING ABOUT
264,00:17:47.87,00:17:47.87,"RIGHT IN HERE? >> YEAH, THAT WILL WORK."
265,00:17:50.00,00:17:50.00,">> READY? ONE, TWO, THREE."
266,00:17:53.07,00:17:53.07,"NICE. NICE, GOOD JOB."
267,00:17:55.80,00:17:55.80,>> I'M LOOKING AT THIS AS MY JOB.
268,00:17:57.97,00:17:57.97,"THIS IS EARLY GAME, IT'S A MARATHON."
269,00:18:00.20,00:18:00.20,BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A CRAZY TWIST OF THE GAME STARTING WITH
270,00:18:03.63,00:18:03.63,THREE TRIBES THROWS THE WHOLE THING UP IN THE AIR.
271,00:18:08.73,00:18:08.73,"TO GET TO DO THIS AGAIN, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN FOR ME AND SO"
272,00:18:16.77,00:18:16.77,REWARDING. THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME OUT HERE
273,00:18:19.00,00:18:19.00,"AND DO THIS, EVEN WITH THESE NEW FOLKS, THEY SEEM VERY COOL."
274,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,">> IT'S RIGHTEOUS, Y'ALL. >> IS IT GOOD?"
275,00:18:23.77,00:18:23.77,>> TAKE A ZIP OF THIS. >> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
276,00:18:26.80,00:18:26.80,KICKING SOME A ++S WITH THEM. IT'S VERY MOVING.
277,00:18:29.33,00:18:29.33,IT'S MOVING TO BE HERE. IT'S MOVING TO BE DOING THIS
278,00:18:32.63,00:18:32.63,AGAIN. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.
279,00:18:35.53,00:18:35.53,">> I KNOW JONATHAN, HE'S A GOOD GUY."
280,00:18:38.17,00:18:38.17,IT'S ALL GOOD. BUT IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO WIN
281,00:18:41.03,00:18:41.03,THIS GAME IT OUGHT TO BE ONE OF US.
282,00:18:43.90,00:18:43.90,HE'S A VETERAN. DO WE WANT A VETERAN TO WIN OR
283,00:18:46.40,00:18:46.40,ONE OF US TO WIN? >> HE'S RIGHT.
284,00:18:48.53,00:18:48.53,">> SURVIVAL SKILLS HE BRINGS TO US, MAYBE WE USE HIM FOR A"
285,00:18:52.63,00:18:52.63,"COUPLE DAYS, AFTER THAT MAYBE WE THINK ABOUT, OKAY."
286,00:18:54.80,00:18:54.80,">> WE'VE GOT THE HANG OF THIS. >> WE'VE GOT SHELTER, FIRE,"
287,00:18:57.90,00:18:57.90,WE'VE GOT FOOD. >> I AGREE.
288,00:18:59.37,00:18:59.37,>> NOT THAT JONATHAN'S NOT A GOOD GUY BUT THE MERE FACT THAT
289,00:19:03.87,00:19:03.87,"HE'S A RETURNING THIRD-TIME PLAYER, I THINK HE'S HAD HIS"
290,00:19:06.93,00:19:06.93,TIME AND I THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE ONE OF US WIN IT IF IT'S
291,00:19:10.97,00:19:10.97,POSSIBLE. SO HE'S OUT AS SOON AS WE CAN
292,00:19:12.60,00:19:12.60,GET HIM OUT. (LAUGHTER)
293,00:19:29.13,00:19:29.13,">> GOT IT! >> GO, GO, GO!"
294,00:19:36.60,00:19:36.60,">> WHEN I LOOKED AT THE THREE DIFFERENT TRIBES, MY TRIBE IS"
295,00:19:40.33,00:19:40.33,THE ONE I WOULD HAVE PICKED. I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD
296,00:19:43.60,00:19:43.60,MIX OF BRAINS AND BRAWN. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
297,00:19:47.70,00:19:47.70,SAID MAYBE YOU SHOULD NEVER PLAY AGAIN BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE OPENING
298,00:19:51.10,00:19:51.10,YOURSELF UP TO THAT-- THE LEGEND OF WHAT I WAS TO WHAT I AM
299,00:19:56.30,00:19:56.30,TODAY. SO IT'S A HUGE RISK.
300,00:19:57.90,00:19:57.90,BUT IT'S WHAT DRIVES ME. >> CLEAR BACK THERE?
301,00:20:03.73,00:20:03.73,CLEAR? >> I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAYBE
302,00:20:06.10,00:20:06.10,"BE AROUND HERE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?"
303,00:20:08.43,00:20:08.43,">> I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT I THINK BUT."
304,00:20:09.90,00:20:09.90,>> I THINK AROUND HERE IS BETTER.
305,00:20:11.37,00:20:11.37,>> I'M DEFINITELY AN ALL OR NOTHING TYPE GIRL AND I'M HERE
306,00:20:14.73,00:20:14.73,TO PLAY THE GAME NO MATTER WHAT. I DEFINITELY CLICKED WITH
307,00:20:18.53,00:20:18.53,CERTAIN PEOPLE. ABI IS FANTASTIC AND I TRUST
308,00:20:21.63,00:20:21.63,HER. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
309,00:20:23.83,00:20:23.83,TRUST EVERYBODY IN THIS GAME BUT YOU HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY.
310,00:20:26.33,00:20:26.33,I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE ON THE SAME TRIBE WITH ME.
311,00:20:28.77,00:20:28.77,>> I KNOW! I WAS TELLING EVERYONE THAT
312,00:20:30.73,00:20:30.73,YOU'RE THE SEXY LIBRARIAN. WHAT DO YOU DO IN NEW YORK?
313,00:20:33.17,00:20:33.17,>> I'M AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT. >> I USED TO BE ONE!
314,00:20:36.03,00:20:36.03,>> I'M TELLING PEOPLE I'M AN EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT BECAUSE I
315,00:20:39.03,00:20:39.03,DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW I'M A BANKER.
316,00:20:41.50,00:20:41.50,THERE'S SUCH A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION ABOUT BANKERS AND
317,00:20:43.90,00:20:43.90,WALL STREET BUT TO BE A GREAT INVESTMENT BANKER YOU HAVE TO
318,00:20:46.57,00:20:46.57,HAVE THE KILLER INSTINCT. BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ON
319,00:20:49.13,00:20:49.13,"YOUR TOES IN NEW YORK, HAILING A CAB IN THE RAIN IN SIX-INCH"
320,00:20:53.30,00:20:53.30,HEELS. SO IF I CAN HANDLE WALL STREET I
321,00:20:54.70,00:20:54.70,"CAN CERTAINLY HANDLE ""SURVIVOR."" >> WHO SHOULD WE BRING IN OUR"
322,00:21:00.17,00:21:00.17,ALLIANCE. >> I LIKE SKUPIN.

324,00:21:03.80,00:21:03.80,">> YEAH, HIM FOR SURE. YEAH."
325,00:21:05.23,00:21:05.23,BUT WHO ELSE? I REALLY THINK THAT PETER'S
326,00:21:07.30,00:21:07.30,STRONG AND HE'S A LITTLE BIT-- >> DUMB?
327,00:21:10.97,00:21:10.97,">> (LAUGHS) YEAH, WE SHOULD HAVE HIM."
328,00:21:13.10,00:21:13.10,YOU AND I FOR SURE. >> WE COULD WIN TOGETHER.
329,00:21:15.47,00:21:15.47,>> TOGETHER. >> ABI AND I JUST CONNECT ON A
330,00:21:19.30,00:21:19.30,GOOD LEVEL AND SO HOPEFULLY THAT CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
331,00:21:22.47,00:21:22.47,GAME. BUT WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT WILL
332,00:21:25.63,00:21:25.63,"LAST. >> OKAY, WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE."
333,00:21:27.73,00:21:27.73,>> I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO.
334,00:21:30.33,00:21:30.33,I HAVE A VERY STRONG BRAZILIAN ACCENT.
335,00:21:33.80,00:21:33.80,">> CAN YOU CUT THIS IN HALF FOR ME, PLEASE?"
336,00:21:37.83,00:21:37.83,HOPEFULLY I CAN USE IT AS A FLIRTATIOUS TOOL.
337,00:21:41.63,00:21:41.63,"MAYBE MY ASS IS TOO BIG. YEAH, I THINK IT IS!"
338,00:21:46.77,00:21:46.77,MY BIG BRAZILIAN BOOTY. >> ABI KEEPS STARING AT ME AND I
339,00:21:50.83,00:21:50.83,THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG ADVANTAGE.
340,00:21:53.30,00:21:53.30,SHE DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE SHE'S READY TO PLAY SOME EVIL GAMES.
341,00:21:57.00,00:21:57.00,SHE'S PRETTY HOT. SHE COULD DEFINITELY DO SOME
342,00:22:01.03,00:22:01.03,DAMAGE. >> SO THAT'S IT.
343,00:22:05.20,00:22:05.20,>> I JUST LIKE-- I DON'T TRUST THE OLDER LADY AND-- LET'S GO
344,00:22:09.40,00:22:09.40,BACK UP SO THEY DON'T GET CURIOUS.
345,00:22:11.33,00:22:11.33,">> IT'S DAY ONE, ME AND ABI AND PETE, WE ALREADY HAVE AN"
346,00:22:15.70,00:22:15.70,ALLIANCE AND I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SOLID ALLIANCE.
347,00:22:18.20,00:22:18.20,BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS A STRONG FOUR SO WE'VE GOT THE
348,00:22:22.57,00:22:22.57,MAJORITY. I'M A HUGE FAN OF THE SHOW AND I
349,00:22:25.03,00:22:25.03,REALLY DO THINK THAT WE CAN'T LOSE WITH YOU ON OUR TEAM AND I
350,00:22:28.87,00:22:28.87,DON'T THINK WE CAN LOSE WITH YOU IN AN ALLIANCE.
351,00:22:32.77,00:22:32.77,"SO WE WERE THINKING ABI, PETE, ME AND YOU."
352,00:22:37.47,00:22:37.47,">> WE MIGHT AS WELL START SOMEWHERE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A"
353,00:22:40.63,00:22:40.63,GOOD PLACE TO START. MY STRATEGY COMING INTO THIS WAS
354,00:22:44.40,00:22:44.40,MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO WITH THE GAME.
355,00:22:47.03,00:22:47.03,"IF YOUR TRIBE IS MOVING SLOW, GO SLOW WITH THEM."
356,00:22:49.40,00:22:49.40,DON'T BE THE PERSON THAT JUST JUMPS OUT IN THE LEAD.
357,00:22:51.90,00:22:51.90,>> I THINK YOU'RE FANTASTIC. >> THANKS.
358,00:22:54.13,00:22:54.13,">> GOOD, I'M GLAD I'M ON YOUR SIDE."
359,00:22:57.33,00:22:57.33,">> THIS IS A LITTLE BIT FOREIGN TO ME, THE THREE-MAN ALLIANCE."
360,00:23:02.00,00:23:02.00,BUT THE THREE YOUNGER PEOPLE MOVE FAST.
361,00:23:04.60,00:23:04.60,I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO MOVE FAST WITH THEM OR I'M IN BIG TROUBLE.
362,00:23:27.73,00:23:27.73,"GROUND, TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT IT, SEE IF YOU'VE GOT SPIDERS OR"
363,00:23:31.60,00:23:31.60,"SCORPIONS OR ANTS ON IT. IN TEXAS, EVERYTHING BITES."

555,00:34:39.43,00:34:39.43,ALWAYS GET OUT OF ANYTHING. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE
556,00:34:43.03,00:34:43.03,LEVEL OF PROGRESS SO FAR BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FIRE WHICH MEANS
557,00:34:45.40,00:34:45.40,WE DON'T HAVE WATER AND IT'S BEEN RAINING SINCE THE CRACK OF
558,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,DAWN. SO I KNEW I NEEDED TO TAKE A
559,00:34:51.93,00:34:51.93,REAL STRONG LEADERSHIP ROLE HERE RIGHT NOW AND SAY LET'S GET ON

564,00:35:10.40,00:35:10.40,WE NEED YOU. I THINK SKUPIN GIVES 110%
565,00:35:14.80,00:35:14.80,CONSTANTLY BUT BY DOING THAT HE MISSES THE LITTLE STUFF LIKE A
566,00:35:17.73,00:35:17.73,TWIG OR A BAMBOO SHOOT THAT'S GOING TO HIT YOU IN THE HEAD.
567,00:35:23.10,00:35:23.10,>> INSIDE OR OUTSIDE. >> I THINK IT'S JUST A SCRAPE.

573,00:35:39.73,00:35:39.73,I THINK HE THINKS HE'S SUPERMAN. SUPERMAN NEEDS TO TAKE A LITTLE

575,00:35:45.00,00:35:45.00,MACHETE AWAY FROM HIP. MAYBE THAT'S HIS KRYPTONITE.
576,00:35:53.97,00:35:53.97,YOU OKAY? >> I HAVE A CUT ON MY FOOT.
577,00:35:56.60,00:35:56.60,">> COME ON, MIKE! THAT'S NOT A BABY CUT, EITHER."

584,00:36:21.87,00:36:21.87,I'M STILL GOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE COCONUTS IN THE
585,00:36:25.90,00:36:25.90,OUTBACK. THIS IS A NEW ADVENTURE FOR ME.
586,00:36:28.37,00:36:28.37,OUCH! DAMN IT!
587,00:36:29.63,00:36:29.63,>> LET'S GET YOU SOME WATER. >> IT'S A SMALL CUT.

753,00:47:16.80,00:47:16.80,BUT THE MAIN THING YOU WANT IS TO FINISH FIRST OR FINISH SECOND

760,00:47:42.27,00:47:42.27,"KALABAW, THOUGH, RIGHT BEHIND AND MATSING WITH A LOT OF TIME"
761,00:47:46.30,00:47:46.30,TO MAKE UP. >> THERE YOU GO!
762,00:47:49.50,00:47:49.50,>> Jeff: KALABAW AND TANDANG DEAD EVEN BOTH WITH THREE PIECES

771,00:48:20.17,00:48:20.17,KALABAW FIRST TO FINISH. WE'RE STILL GOING FOR SECOND.
772,00:48:23.43,00:48:23.43,AND LISA DOES IT. TANDANG SURVIVES WINNING
773,00:48:26.77,00:48:26.77,IMMUNITY AND REWARD AS WELL. MATSING HEADING TO TRIBAL
774,00:48:31.17,00:48:31.17,"COUNCIL. >> I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT GOOD AT"
775,00:48:34.63,00:48:34.63,"PUZZLES. >> Jeff: KALABAW, HUGE"

780,00:48:52.50,00:48:52.50,ALONG WITH IT. GOOD WORK.
781,00:48:54.27,00:48:54.27,"NO TRIBAL COUNCIL FOR TANDANG. MATSING, WHAT HAPPENED RUSSELL?"
782,00:49:01.00,00:49:01.00,">> WELL, YOU KNOW, JEFF, ALL I CAN SAY IS AT THE END OF THE DAY"
783,00:49:04.40,00:49:04.40,I MADE THE DECISION ON WHO WAS GOING TO DO WHAT SO I CARRY SOME
784,00:49:07.47,00:49:07.47,OF THAT WATER. IT'S JUST-- WE ALL HAVE TO CLICK
785,00:49:10.70,00:49:10.70,"NEXT TIME. AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY, JEFF."
786,00:49:12.97,00:49:12.97,THERE ALWAYS IS A NEXT TIME. >> Jeff: THERE'S A NEXT TIME
787,00:49:16.17,00:49:16.17,FOR FIVE OF YOU. NOT A NEXT TIME FOR ALL SIX OF
788,00:49:18.93,00:49:18.93,"YOU. TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT, SOMEBODY"
789,00:49:20.63,00:49:20.63,FROM YOUR TRIBE WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF THIS
790,00:49:23.97,00:49:23.97,GAME. YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE
791,00:49:25.37,00:49:25.37,THAT OUT. SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
792,00:49:27.13,00:49:27.13,GRAB YOUR STUFF; HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
793,00:49:30.20,00:49:30.20,>> Jeff: . >> RUSSELL TOOK OVER AND DIDN'T
794,00:49:32.17,00:49:32.17,LISTEN TO A SINGLE WORD ANYBODY SAID SO I GET TO GO SEE TRIBAL
795,00:49:35.97,00:49:35.97,ON NIGHT THREE. >> NOW YOU KNOW HOW THIS GOES.
796,00:49:56.20,00:49:56.20,YOU SEE THESE CHALLENGES ARE BRUTAL.
797,00:49:58.67,00:49:58.67,BUT I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE AND I'M TELLING YOU YOU HAVE TO
798,00:50:06.47,00:50:06.47,DIG SO DEEP IN YOURSELF. >> CAN I SPEAK BEFORE-- AND I'D
799,00:50:10.63,00:50:10.63,"LIKE TO TALK TO THE WHOLE TRIBE, ALL RIGHT."
800,00:50:13.30,00:50:13.30,THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GAME WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO-- I
801,00:50:16.17,00:50:16.17,"MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO PULL THE FIRE OUT OF YOUR STOMACH AND"
802,00:50:19.37,00:50:19.37,DECIDE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO THROW DOWN.
803,00:50:22.70,00:50:22.70,"AND YOU HAD TO PULL ME. I THREW MYSELF ON TOP-- I MEAN,"
804,00:50:26.43,00:50:26.43,"THREE DAYS IN, BROTHER. I AIN'T BUILT FOR IT."
805,00:50:31.90,00:50:31.90,">> AS I'M KIND OF FINISHING THE PEP TALK, ZANE BASICALLY CUTS ME"
806,00:50:35.83,00:50:35.83,OFF AND THE GUY THROWS HIMSELF UNDER THE BUS.
807,00:50:37.73,00:50:37.73,">> MY LEGS CRAMPED SO HARD THAT I SAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?"
808,00:50:43.10,00:50:43.10,Y'ALL DIDN'T. SO I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IT'S A
809,00:50:46.07,00:50:46.07,CHOICE. >> WHAT IT DID WAS IT MADE THE
810,00:50:48.57,00:50:48.57,DECISION PRETTY DAMN EASY IN TERMS OF WHO'S GOING HOME
811,00:50:53.33,00:50:53.33,TONIGHT. >> I LOVE THIS GAME AND I LOVE
812,00:50:56.03,00:50:56.03,"IT FOR KNOWING HOW POWERFUL IT IS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
813,00:51:01.57,00:51:01.57,BUT I DESERVE-- I DESERVE TO GO. MY WHOLE REASON WHY I'M THROWING
814,00:51:07.87,00:51:07.87,MY NECK ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK IS TO ESTABLISH WHAT I'M RUNNING
815,00:51:11.73,00:51:11.73,AGAINST. THIS WHOLE RUSE THAT I JUST
816,00:51:13.40,00:51:13.40,THREW ON WAS JUST TO FILL OUT MY TRIBE EXACTLY HOW I NEED TO WORK
817,00:51:18.07,00:51:18.07,THINGS. IT'S GOING TO BE WORSE AND WORSE
818,00:51:19.57,00:51:19.57,AND WORSE. SO HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY LOVES ME
819,00:51:23.30,00:51:23.30,TO THE POINT TO WHERE THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE ME AS A HINDRANCE
820,00:51:27.33,00:51:27.33,"THAN TO KEEP RUSSELL. I TOOK MY SHOT, I'M PLAYING"
821,00:51:29.93,00:51:29.93,CHESS THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW AND HOPEFULLY I'M GOING TO KING
822,00:51:32.83,00:51:32.83,"ME. >> ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO, I THINK"
823,00:51:39.13,00:51:39.13,IT'S GOING TO BE ZANE. ALL RIGHT?
824,00:51:42.17,00:51:42.17,"SO YOU GUYS ARE GOOD? AND-- YOU KNOW, ALL I CAN SAY IS"
825,00:51:48.27,00:51:48.27,"WELCOME TO ""SURVIVOR,"" DIG DEEP, YOU GUYS GOT IT IN YOU."
826,00:51:51.77,00:51:51.77,">> I'M FORMER MISS UTAH TEEN. I'M A VERY, VERY COMPETITIVE"
827,00:51:55.60,00:51:55.60,PERSON. I NEVER LIKE TO LOSE.
828,00:51:57.27,00:51:57.27,I'M SO ANNOYED BECAUSE RUSSELL WANTS EVERYONE TO THINK THAT
829,00:51:59.90,00:51:59.90,"HE'S NOT THE LEADER. HE'S LIKE ""I'M NOT THE LEADER,"
830,00:52:03.47,00:52:03.47,"GUYS."" BUT HE MAKES THOSE CALLS LIKE IN"
831,00:52:05.10,00:52:05.10,THE CHALLENGES. A LEADER WOULD LISTEN TO HIS
832,00:52:07.17,00:52:07.17,TRIBE AND REALLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THEIR
833,00:52:09.37,00:52:09.37,STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES ARE. I'M PISSED.
834,00:52:17.90,00:52:17.90,"I'M JUST SO BUMMED. I SAID I'M NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES,"
835,00:52:22.67,00:52:22.67,HE PUTS ME AT PUZZLES BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES.
836,00:52:25.90,00:52:25.90,>> I DIDN'T LIKE THAT TACK TAKE--
837,00:52:27.73,00:52:27.73,">> HE'S LIKE I'M NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES, YOU DO PUZZLES."
838,00:52:31.20,00:52:31.20,"I'M NOT GOOD AT PUZZLES, EITHER. THAT'S NOT FAIR."
839,00:52:34.07,00:52:34.07,IF WE HAVE TO VOTE ZANE OUT I WOULD IF IT WOULD GET ME FURTHER
840,00:52:36.60,00:52:36.60,IN THE GAME BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE RUSSELL GONE BECAUSE I LIKE
841,00:52:39.33,00:52:39.33,ZANE. HE IS SO FUNNY.
842,00:52:40.60,00:52:40.60,HE'S JUST LIKE-- HE'S A GOOD GENUINE PERSON AND I WOULD LIKE
843,00:52:43.47,00:52:43.47,TO SEE HIM AROUND. I KNOW HE'S NOT THAT STRONG IN
844,00:52:46.07,00:52:46.07,CHALLENGES BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HIM GIVE UP.
845,00:52:47.63,00:52:47.63,HOW COULD YOU GIVE UP? >> I'M NOT GIVING UP.
846,00:52:50.57,00:52:50.57,>> YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR YOU.
847,00:52:52.27,00:52:52.27,>> LOGISTICALLY HE HAD TO LITERALLY PULL ME ACROSS THE
848,00:52:54.97,00:52:54.97,LINE. >> ME AND ROXANNE WANTED TO RUN
849,00:52:56.80,00:52:56.80,AND GUESS WHAT? HE SAID NO.
850,00:52:58.20,00:52:58.20,"IT WAS HIM, NOT YOU. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE FOR?"
851,00:53:00.63,00:53:00.63,>> I MEAN-- >> YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR RUSSELL.
852,00:53:02.60,00:53:02.60,">> IT'S UP TO Y'ALL, MAN. I AIN'T GIVING UP."
853,00:53:05.60,00:53:05.60,"I'M HERE FOR YOU, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
854,00:53:08.03,00:53:08.03,>> STICK WITH IT. DON'T GO.
855,00:53:09.53,00:53:09.53,">> ALL RIGHT. ANGIE WAS LIKE ""PLEASE DON'T GO"
856,00:53:13.00,00:53:13.00,"HOME. LET'S BLIND SIDE RUSS."""
857,00:53:14.87,00:53:14.87,">> YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME, BECAUSE WE NEED YOU."
858,00:53:17.57,00:53:17.57,WE NEED SOME LAUGHTER. >> YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN A MOVE
859,00:53:20.53,00:53:20.53,"LIKE THIS IN ""SURVIVOR"" HISTORY. >> ARE YOU FOR SURE TOSSING IN"
860,00:53:25.77,00:53:25.77,"THE TOWEL, KID? YOU'RE NOT TOSSING IN THE TOWEL"
861,00:53:28.20,00:53:28.20,BUT-- THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE SCARES ME.
862,00:53:29.87,00:53:29.87,I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. >> ARE YOU BLIND SIDING?
863,00:53:32.10,00:53:32.10,">> I MEAN-- IF YOU WANT TO GO HOME, I'LL SEND YOU HOME BUT,"
864,00:53:38.10,00:53:38.10,"LIKE, THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THE GAME COULD GO."
865,00:53:40.73,00:53:40.73,>> MALCOLM CAME TO ME AND BEGGED ME TO STAY.
866,00:53:42.87,00:53:42.87,NOW THE ONLY THING I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NOW IS IF RUSS
867,00:53:47.23,00:53:47.23,ACTUALLY HAS THE IDOL. I GIVE YOU 100% THAT HE DOES
868,00:53:50.60,00:53:50.60,HAVE THE IDOL. >> ZANE WAS ALREADY GOING HOME
869,00:53:54.33,00:53:54.33,BY HIS OWN FREE WILL BUT THE THING IS WE THINK RUSSELL HAS AN
870,00:54:00.97,00:54:00.97,IDOL. THE SKETCHIEST PART IS THAT THE
871,00:54:02.40,00:54:02.40,INFORMATION COMES FROM ZANE OF ALL PEOPLE THAT RUSSELL HAS AN
872,00:54:05.47,00:54:05.47,IDOL. BUT IF WE VOTE OUT RUSSELL WE'RE
873,00:54:07.83,00:54:07.83,OBVIOUSLY DOWN MULL WISE THREE DAYS IN.
874,00:54:09.97,00:54:09.97,I THINK ZANE AT ONE POINT ASKED RUSSELL TO DRAG HIM THROUGH THE
875,00:54:14.63,00:54:14.63,COURSE. SO QUITE LITERALLY HE'S THE ONE
876,00:54:17.03,00:54:17.03,WEIGHING THE TRIBE DOWN. HAVE YOU TALKED TO ZANE ABOUT
877,00:54:19.43,00:54:19.43,THE IDOL AT ALL? >> NO.
878,00:54:21.37,00:54:21.37,>> WE'RE 95% SURE RUSSELL HAD IT.
879,00:54:23.63,00:54:23.63,>> DAMN IT! RIGHT NOW THERE'S A FEELING THAT
880,00:54:25.87,00:54:25.87,RUSSELL HAS MAYBE FOUND AN IMMUNITY IDOL AND SO ZANE MIGHT
881,00:54:28.80,00:54:28.80,"HAVE A SHOT TO STAY. BUT, YOU KNOW, NOTHING AGAINST"
882,00:54:32.27,00:54:32.27,ZANE BUT THIS IS NOT THE POINT IN THE GAME WHERE YOU CAN HAVE
883,00:54:34.57,00:54:34.57,"WEAK PLAYERS. GOD, IT SUCK HAVING TO MAKE THIS"
884,00:54:38.43,00:54:38.43,"DECISION. >> OH, MAN."
885,00:54:39.80,00:54:39.80,I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS. >> NO.
886,00:54:41.30,00:54:41.30,"LET ME TELL YOU, DUDE, THEY SUCK."
887,00:54:44.47,00:54:44.47,>> I THINK I'M OKAY TONIGHT. BUT I ACTUALLY MADE MY FIRST
888,00:54:48.80,00:54:48.80,MISTAKE TODAY. I JUST CLICKED INTO THIS KIND OF
889,00:54:52.40,00:54:52.40,"CHIEF MODE, IF YOU WILL, AND THOUGHT I HAVE TO MAKE THIS"
890,00:54:56.83,00:54:56.83,CALL. I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
891,00:54:57.73,00:54:57.73,"THIS IS NOT ABOUT LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP KILLS, DUDE, AND I"
892,00:55:01.63,00:55:01.63,WENT RIGHT BACK INTO THE OLD MODE.
893,00:55:03.93,00:55:03.93,YOU NEVER KNOW WITH THIS GAME. THESE PEOPLE COULD VOTE ME OUT
894,00:55:07.30,00:55:07.30,TONIGHT. >> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS
895,00:55:28.63,00:55:28.63,"A TORCH, GRAB A TORCH, APPROACH THE FLAME AND GET FIRE."
896,00:55:37.37,00:55:37.37,THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
897,00:55:40.80,00:55:40.80,GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE YOU ARE
898,00:55:44.07,00:55:44.07,"STILL IN THIS GAME AND WHEN YOUR FIRE IS GONE, SO ARE YOU AND"
899,00:55:47.30,00:55:47.30,THAT IS GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR ONE OF YOU TONIGHT.
900,00:55:52.40,00:55:52.40,"ONLY THREE DAYS IN, ZANE, AND SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME."
901,00:55:53.83,00:55:53.83,">> IT'S A SAD THING, JEFF. BUT IT'S THE WAY OF ""SURVIVOR."""
902,00:55:58.50,00:55:58.50,">> Jeff: DENICE, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HAVING RETURNING"
903,00:56:01.43,00:56:01.43,"PLAYERS? >> YOU KNOW, QUITE HONESTLY I"
904,00:56:02.83,00:56:02.83,WAS MIXED AT FIRST BECAUSE I WANTED IT TO BE A REALLY PURE
905,00:56:05.87,00:56:05.87,GAME KIND OF IN THE SENSE OF JUST THIS BEING OUR GAME.
906,00:56:09.33,00:56:09.33,"BUT IT'S ALREADY BEEN, YOU KNOW, AN ASSET TO HAVE SOMEBODY REALLY"
907,00:56:12.50,00:56:12.50,GIVING US TIPS ON HOW TO DO THIS OR HOW TO SAVE A FIRE THROUGH
908,00:56:15.57,00:56:15.57,THREE DAYS OF RAIN. SO IT DEFINITELY CHANGES THE
909,00:56:17.93,00:56:17.93,GAME PLAY. BUT IN THIS RAIN IT'S A GIFT.
910,00:56:21.67,00:56:21.67,">> Jeff: ZANE, IT'S KIND OF A TRICKY DILEMMA, ISN'T IT?"
911,00:56:25.20,00:56:25.20,"YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO CAN BRING SOMETHING YOU NEED, EXPERIENCE."
912,00:56:27.93,00:56:27.93,BUT GOING IN THEY'RE A BETTER PLAYER THAN YOU.
913,00:56:30.87,00:56:30.87,>> OFF THE TOP THEY ARE BETTER THAN YOU ARE.
914,00:56:33.27,00:56:33.27,"IT'S KIND OF LIKE AN ONION, MAN. MORE LAYERS YOU PEEL BACK, THE"
915,00:56:37.17,00:56:37.17,MORE YOU START TO CRY. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
916,00:56:40.77,00:56:40.77,"AND-- >> Jeff: OKAY, YOU LOST ME."
917,00:56:42.57,00:56:42.57,(LAUGHTER) >> I WAS NERVOUS--
918,00:56:44.90,00:56:44.90,">> Jeff: WAIT, WAIT. GO BACK TO THE ONION."
919,00:56:47.27,00:56:47.27,">> YOU KNOW, AT FIRST LIKE YOU GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT."
920,00:56:50.23,00:56:50.23,THEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT OF IT THEN YOU REALIZE
921,00:56:53.40,00:56:53.40,YOU'RE GETTING TOO MUCH OUT OF IT.
922,00:56:55.07,00:56:55.07,"SO THE MORE LAYERS YOU PEEL, THE MORE YOU CRY, MAN."
923,00:56:58.57,00:56:58.57,THIS GUY IS A KILLER ATHLETE. HE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT FIRE AND
924,00:57:03.07,00:57:03.07,WATER AND SHELTER. LIKE I SAID-- THE MORE YOU PEEL
925,00:57:06.80,00:57:06.80,"BACK, THE MORE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF A BETTER PLAYER"
926,00:57:09.27,00:57:09.27,YOU'RE COMING AGAINST RATHER THAN BEING ON EQUAL GROUND.
927,00:57:11.97,00:57:11.97,">> Jeff: OKAY. SO NOW THAT I'M CAUGHT UP THERE,"
928,00:57:14.97,00:57:14.97,"RUSSELL, DOES THAT SOUND LIKE ""I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE TAUGHT US BUT"
929,00:57:19.17,00:57:19.17,"MAN YOU'RE TOO GOOD OF A PLAYER AND YOU'RE GOING""?"
930,00:57:21.93,00:57:21.93,">> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE."
931,00:57:24.07,00:57:24.07,EVEN WITH THIS ONION THING I THINK TODAY I KIND OF BLEW IT
932,00:57:27.83,00:57:27.83,BECAUSE INSTEAD OF BEING 2.0 AND JUST BEING PART OF A GROUP I
933,00:57:32.30,00:57:32.30,"WENT BACK TO 1.0, THAT DICTATOR. AND I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE."
934,00:57:37.50,00:57:37.50,">> Jeff: MALCOLM, DID YOU PICK UP ON RUSSELL BECOMES A"
935,00:57:40.53,00:57:40.53,"DICTATOR, AS HE SAYS? >> HE CAME ON A LITTLE STRONG"
936,00:57:43.97,00:57:43.97,PRE-CHALLENGE TODAY. >> AND I'M--
937,00:57:46.20,00:57:46.20,">> AND, WE ALL-- IT'S ON THE TABLE, WE ALL KNOW."
938,00:57:49.13,00:57:49.13,>> IT WAS WRONG. BUT I WOULDN'T BE COMPLETELY
939,00:57:53.00,00:57:53.00,SHOCKED IF I WAS VOTED OUT TONIGHT.
940,00:57:54.63,00:57:54.63,>> Jeff: HOW DISAPPOINTED WOULD YOU BE?
941,00:57:57.03,00:57:57.03,">> I MEAN, THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED I GOT CARRIED OUT ON MY"
942,00:58:00.97,00:58:00.97,BACK. I GET BLESSED WITH A SECOND
943,00:58:02.07,00:58:02.07,OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY AGAIN AND I GO OUT FIRST.
944,00:58:04.00,00:58:04.00,THAT WOULD JUST BE A DAGGER IN THE HEART.
945,00:58:06.93,00:58:06.93,">> Jeff: ROXY, DID HE COME ON A LITTLE STRONG?"
946,00:58:09.67,00:58:09.67,>> ABSOLUTELY. I FEEL LIKE OUT OF NOWHERE HE'S
947,00:58:12.27,00:58:12.27,"JUST LIKE ""NO, WHOA. IT'S GOING TO BE THIS, THIS, AND"
948,00:58:16.37,00:58:16.37,"THIS."" AND I HAVE MILITARY BACKGROUND"
949,00:58:17.47,00:58:17.47,SO I JUST WENT RIGHT INTO MY GEAR WHICH IS YOU ARE SUPERIOR
950,00:58:21.10,00:58:21.10,"TO ME, THAT IS HOW YOU'RE ACTING RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO TAKE"
951,00:58:24.53,00:58:24.53,"DIRECTION AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. >> Jeff: ANGIE, DO YOU AGREE"
952,00:58:28.63,00:58:28.63,WITH THAT? >> YES.
953,00:58:29.73,00:58:29.73,"YOU KNOW, I RAN TRACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, I ASKED IF I COULD RUN"
954,00:58:32.83,00:58:32.83,BUT NOPE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO THE PUZZLE AND HE TOLD ME
955,00:58:35.87,00:58:35.87,IF WE LOSE IT'S YOUR FAULT. >> I DON'T KNOW-- I MEAN-->>
956,00:58:40.13,00:58:40.13,"YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY-- >> I DON'T THINK THAT WAS"
957,00:58:42.43,00:58:42.43,EXACTLY WHAT I SAID. >> Jeff: ANGIE'S PRETTY SURE
958,00:58:44.60,00:58:44.60,"IT WAS EXACTLY. >> WELL, THE BOTTOM LINE IS SHE"
959,00:58:46.93,00:58:46.93,IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I WENT INTO DICTATOR MODE AND IT
960,00:58:50.27,00:58:50.27,"WAS LIKE NOPE, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING."
961,00:58:52.60,00:58:52.60,THAT'S RIGHT. HOPEFULLY THIS DAY DOESN'T
962,00:58:59.67,00:58:59.67,BESPEAK FOR THE OTHER TWO DAYS. ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW I HAVE SO
963,00:59:02.57,00:59:02.57,MUCH MORE TO GIVE GIVE AND I HOPE I GET THAT OPPORTUNITY.
964,00:59:05.63,00:59:05.63,">> Jeff: ZANE, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE LEG YOU WERE ASSIGNED"
965,00:59:07.90,00:59:07.90,"TO DO? >> WELL, I QUIT SMOKING THE DAY"
966,00:59:11.20,00:59:11.20,OF COMING HERE. AND I MADE SURE I LET THE WHOLE
967,00:59:14.60,00:59:14.60,"TRIBE KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, RUNNING AIN'T THE DEAL."
968,00:59:17.43,00:59:17.43,"I'M GETTING BACK BUT I AIN'T GOT BACK, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"
969,00:59:20.10,00:59:20.10,"I KNOW IT'S MY FAULT, I'M A DUMMY."
970,00:59:22.33,00:59:22.33,I SHOULD HAVE PUT A LITTLE MORE FORETHOUGHT INTO THAT.
971,00:59:24.60,00:59:24.60,BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. >> Jeff: REGARDLESS WHO PUT
972,00:59:27.77,00:59:27.77,"YOU IN THAT POSITION, IS THERE RESPONSIBILITY, DENICE, HOW YOU"
973,00:59:31.20,00:59:31.20,"PERFORM IN A CHALLENGE? >> I MEAN, I-- ABSOLUTELY."
974,00:59:35.10,00:59:35.10,I COULD SAY I WAS A STRONG SWIMMER AND I GOT OUT THERE AND
975,00:59:38.27,00:59:38.27,"I'M PUSHING A 200 POUND CHEST AND I SUCKED, SURE, THEY COULD"
976,00:59:41.40,00:59:41.40,POINT THAT AT ME. OR YOU CAN TURN THAT AROUND AND
977,00:59:44.17,00:59:44.17,"GO ""OR WAS THAT OUR LEADERSHIP? "" IT'S PART OF THE GAME."
978,00:59:48.03,00:59:48.03,>> Jeff: ZANE? >> WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP I
979,00:59:50.53,00:59:50.53,"TOLD EVERYBODY SEND ME HOME IF YOU WANT TO, I UNDERSTAND THE"
980,00:59:53.10,00:59:53.10,RUNNING WAS NOT MY DEAL. I WOULD RATHER STEP OUT OF YOUR
981,00:59:55.60,00:59:55.60,"WAY THAN THE HOLD YOU UP. >> Jeff: RUSSELL, YOU'RE OFF"
982,00:59:59.57,00:59:59.57,"THE BOX. >> IT SOUNDS CONVENIENT BUT, YOU"
983,01:00:02.10,01:00:02.10,"KNOW, JEFF, I'VE BEEN TO THIS DANCE BEFORE AND YOU NEVER KNOW"
984,01:00:05.43,01:00:05.43,WHAT CONVERSATIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE FROM THAT TIME TO THAT HE
985,01:00:08.63,01:00:08.63,MADE THAT PRONOUNCEMENT TO THIS TIME NOW.
986,01:00:12.43,01:00:12.43,"I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES STUFF CAN BE CODED, IT CAN CUT ALL KINDS"
987,01:00:16.87,01:00:16.87,OF DIFFERENT E WAYS. >> Jeff: WHAT ODDS DO YOU GIVE
988,01:00:19.77,01:00:19.77,YOURSELF RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE AFTER THIS VOTE?
989,01:00:22.43,01:00:22.43,">> I DON'T KNOW, JEFF. BUT I'M READY TO BE HERE."
990,01:00:25.00,01:00:25.00,LET'S BE CLEAR. >> Jeff: OKAY.
991,01:00:28.93,01:00:28.93,"IT IS TIME TO VOTE. MALCOLM, YOU'RE UP."
992,01:00:48.37,01:00:48.37,">> ZANE, I'M NOT READY TO GO HOME YET."
993,01:00:52.17,01:00:52.17,"I WISH YOU LOTS OF LUCK, MAN. >> IF YOU AIN'T FIRST, YOU'RE"
994,01:01:06.73,01:01:06.73,LAST. >> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE

997,01:01:42.83,01:01:42.83,"OKAY, ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
998,01:01:46.33,01:01:46.33,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL
999,01:01:49.57,01:01:49.57,COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY. I'LL READ THE VOTES.
