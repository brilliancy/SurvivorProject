6,00:00:17.47,00:00:18.97,formed first impressions.
7,00:00:19.00,00:00:20.77,>> Sarah's arrival was almost

24,00:00:48.80,00:00:49.53,Listen.
25,00:00:49.57,00:00:50.43,Can you hear that gobbling?
26,00:00:50.47,00:00:51.53,Don't move.
27,00:00:51.57,00:00:53.37,"It's a chicken, I swear to"
28,00:00:53.40,00:00:54.20,God.

35,00:01:03.57,00:01:04.90,relationships were quick to
36,00:01:04.93,00:01:05.27,form...
37,00:01:05.30,00:01:06.30,>> I'm already in love with
38,00:01:06.33,00:01:06.97,Hunter.
39,00:01:07.00,00:01:08.60,>> We fill this thing up and let

44,00:01:12.33,00:01:13.17,>> That's an idea.
45,00:01:13.20,00:01:14.60,>> I'm definitely attracted to
46,00:01:14.63,00:01:15.63,"Rob, and him the same."
47,00:01:15.67,00:01:16.70,He's told me the same.
48,00:01:16.73,00:01:18.00,>> PROBST: ...others were quick
49,00:01:18.03,00:01:18.40,to battle.
50,00:01:18.43,00:01:19.67,">> I know, everything needs to"

54,00:01:22.93,00:01:24.17,>> I knew immediately that you
55,00:01:24.20,00:01:25.37,guys were talking... saying I
56,00:01:25.40,00:01:26.00,wasn't working.

58,00:01:27.27,00:01:27.77,about this...
59,00:01:27.80,00:01:28.97,">> Apparently, I have to be."
60,00:01:29.00,00:01:30.57,>> PROBST: And everybody had to
61,00:01:30.60,00:01:32.03,deal with the realities of a
62,00:01:32.07,00:01:36.10,harsh tropical landscape.
63,00:01:36.13,00:01:37.63,>> I landed right on top of a
64,00:01:37.67,00:01:38.93,sea urchin.
65,00:01:38.97,00:01:40.43,I need somebody who can pee
66,00:01:40.47,00:01:41.20,on my hand.
67,00:01:41.23,00:01:42.63,That's supposed to be what
68,00:01:42.67,00:01:44.27,you're supposed to do for that
69,00:01:44.30,00:01:45.87,kind of venomous sting from a
70,00:01:45.90,00:01:47.63,"sea urchin, is to urinate on it."
71,00:01:47.67,00:01:48.40,>> PROBST: Go!
72,00:01:48.43,00:01:49.83,They were divided into two
73,00:01:49.87,00:01:51.23,"tribes, Maraamu and Rotu."
74,00:01:51.27,00:01:52.60,They competed against one
75,00:01:52.63,00:01:54.33,"another in challenges, but from"
76,00:01:54.37,00:01:56.10,"the outset, Rotu easily defeated"
77,00:01:56.13,00:01:56.80,Maraamu.
78,00:01:56.83,00:01:59.47,"Rotu, immunity. Who wants it?"
79,00:01:59.50,00:02:00.27,Again...
80,00:02:00.30,00:02:01.63,"Rotu, immunity!"
81,00:02:01.67,00:02:02.57,...and again.
82,00:02:02.60,00:02:03.03,Rotu!
83,00:02:03.07,00:02:04.07,(cheering)
84,00:02:04.10,00:02:05.90,Maraamu was forced to vote out
85,00:02:05.93,00:02:07.57,three members in a row.
86,00:02:07.60,00:02:09.47,"Hunter, one of the tribe's"
87,00:02:09.50,00:02:11.50,"strongest members, had harsh"
88,00:02:11.53,00:02:12.90,words for his former tribe.
89,00:02:12.93,00:02:14.60,>> I was camping with a bunch of
90,00:02:14.63,00:02:16.17,"knuckle heads though, and I'll"
91,00:02:16.20,00:02:17.80,tell you that to your face when
92,00:02:17.83,00:02:18.67,I see you again.
93,00:02:18.70,00:02:20.20,">> PROBST: With Hunter gone,"
94,00:02:20.23,00:02:21.57,Rob became Maraamu's self-
95,00:02:21.60,00:02:22.47,appointed leader.
96,00:02:22.50,00:02:23.90,>> Fear keeps people loyal.
97,00:02:23.93,00:02:25.27,That's straight out of The
98,00:02:25.30,00:02:26.43," Godfather, it's true."
99,00:02:26.47,00:02:28.03,>> PROBST: But a reshuffling of
100,00:02:28.07,00:02:29.57,the tribes sent the survivors
101,00:02:29.60,00:02:31.13,scrambling for new strategies.
102,00:02:31.17,00:02:32.77,"Pick a disk, it doesn't matter,"
103,00:02:32.80,00:02:34.43,it's totally random.
104,00:02:34.47,00:02:35.63,Swap out.
105,00:02:35.67,00:02:37.20,You're now a member of Rotu.
106,00:02:37.23,00:02:38.97,The new Maraamu was the obvious
107,00:02:39.00,00:02:40.63,"underdog, but after an initial"
108,00:02:40.67,00:02:42.23,"loss, resulting in one tribe"
109,00:02:42.27,00:02:43.80,"member's departure, the tiny"
110,00:02:43.83,00:02:45.40,tribe of three women and the
111,00:02:45.43,00:02:46.80,oldest male castaway came
112,00:02:46.83,00:02:48.23,roaring back to win three
113,00:02:48.27,00:02:49.70,challenges in a row.
114,00:02:49.73,00:02:51.10,Maraamu wins feast.
115,00:02:51.13,00:02:53.23,"At Rotu, John led an alliance"
116,00:02:53.27,00:02:55.53,"with Tammy, Zoe and the General"
117,00:02:55.57,00:02:57.70,that seemed destined to go to
118,00:02:57.73,00:02:58.10,the end.
119,00:02:58.13,00:02:59.53,>> We made ourselves a little
120,00:02:59.57,00:03:01.17,pact that we're going to try to
121,00:03:01.20,00:03:02.77,control this and take it down to
122,00:03:02.80,00:03:04.03,be the final four people.
123,00:03:04.07,00:03:05.47,">> If we do it right, the winner"
124,00:03:05.50,00:03:06.90,will come out of this group.
125,00:03:06.93,00:03:08.60,>> PROBST: After the alliance
126,00:03:08.63,00:03:10.37,claimed their first victim and
127,00:03:10.40,00:03:12.10,"Maraamu lost one more member,"
128,00:03:12.13,00:03:13.93,the two tribes merged on day 20
129,00:03:13.97,00:03:15.73,"and a new tribe, Soliantu, was"
130,00:03:15.77,00:03:16.30,born.
131,00:03:16.33,00:03:19.67,">> One, two, three, Soliantu!"
132,00:03:19.70,00:03:21.00,>> PROBST: But the good cheer
133,00:03:21.03,00:03:22.03,and camaraderie quickly
134,00:03:22.07,00:03:23.30,"disappeared, when an argument"
135,00:03:23.33,00:03:24.27,broke out over voting
136,00:03:24.30,00:03:24.73,strategies.
137,00:03:24.77,00:03:25.60,>> You included us!
138,00:03:25.63,00:03:26.97,"You said all right, we're going"
139,00:03:27.00,00:03:27.73,to go in seventh.
140,00:03:27.77,00:03:29.13,"Everybody was like, ""We a team,"
141,00:03:29.17,00:03:29.63,"we a team."""
142,00:03:29.67,00:03:31.93,>> PROBST: John's alliance voted
143,00:03:31.97,00:03:34.03,"again as a block, and Boston"
144,00:03:34.07,00:03:36.33,Rob was the seventh person voted
145,00:03:36.37,00:03:36.83,off the island.
146,00:03:36.87,00:03:38.70,"Rob, the tribe has spoken."
147,00:03:38.73,00:03:40.10,">> Good luck, guys."

150,00:03:43.60,00:03:45.17,and Kathy came together and
151,00:03:45.20,00:03:46.77,decided to dismantle John's
152,00:03:46.80,00:03:47.17,alliance.
153,00:03:47.20,00:03:48.70,>> I'm not going to go out fifth
154,00:03:48.73,00:03:49.13,or sixth.
155,00:03:49.17,00:03:50.20,We've worked too hard.
156,00:03:50.23,00:03:51.73,We've been here for too long and
157,00:03:51.77,00:03:53.07,"worked too hard, and I'm not"
158,00:03:53.10,00:03:54.30,going to go out like that.

160,00:03:55.83,00:03:57.17,started to see what I've been
161,00:03:57.20,00:03:58.33,talking about all along.
162,00:03:58.37,00:03:59.87,So now the new agreement we have
163,00:03:59.90,00:04:01.47,"is myself, Neleh, V, Paschal and"
164,00:04:01.50,00:04:01.83,Kathy.
165,00:04:01.87,00:04:03.60,We're going to vote John out
166,00:04:03.63,00:04:04.10,tonight.
167,00:04:04.13,00:04:06.00,">> PROBST: John was voted out,"
168,00:04:06.03,00:04:07.27,and the alliance was
169,00:04:07.30,00:04:09.27,systematically eliminated one by
170,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.53,one.
171,00:04:09.57,00:04:11.37,Only five survivors remained.
172,00:04:11.40,00:04:12.00,(shouting)
173,00:04:12.03,00:04:13.87,"Last week, Kathy won immunity"
174,00:04:13.90,00:04:15.93,and found herself caught between
175,00:04:15.97,00:04:17.90,two groups vying for her vote.
176,00:04:17.93,00:04:19.63,"At a heated Tribal Council,"
177,00:04:19.67,00:04:21.30,"tempers flared, as Sean and"
178,00:04:21.33,00:04:23.40,Paschal fought for Kathy's vote.
179,00:04:23.43,00:04:24.90,>> That tells me a lot of what
180,00:04:24.93,00:04:26.43,Sean's been doing and thinking
181,00:04:26.47,00:04:27.97,and I think he's disingenuous.
182,00:04:28.00,00:04:29.13,>> I don't think it was
183,00:04:29.17,00:04:29.80,disingenuous.
184,00:04:29.83,00:04:31.30,"What I think is, five minutes"
185,00:04:31.33,00:04:32.50,"ago, I stick to my word."
186,00:04:32.53,00:04:33.83,">> Listen once in a while,"
187,00:04:33.87,00:04:35.33,instead of running your mouth
188,00:04:35.37,00:04:36.00,all the time.
189,00:04:36.03,00:04:37.63,>> I'm listening! I'm listening!
190,00:04:37.67,00:04:38.57,>> Okay.

192,00:04:40.23,00:04:41.93,decided to align with Paschal
193,00:04:41.97,00:04:43.67,and Neleh to vote Sean out of
194,00:04:43.70,00:04:44.63,the tribe.

205,00:06:19.13,00:06:23.90,>> Let me get some dry stuff.I think they're a little wet.
206,00:06:23.90,00:06:28.00,"It rained here, it feels like."
207,00:06:31.87,00:06:32.53,>> There you go.

209,00:06:33.73,00:06:34.63,It's that bad breath.
210,00:06:34.67,00:06:35.73,>> It is that bad breath.
211,00:06:35.77,00:06:39.27,">> Good job, you guys."
212,00:06:41.90,00:06:43.97,>> That was an interesting
213,00:06:44.00,00:06:45.20,Tribal Council.
214,00:06:45.23,00:06:46.40,Good God. Whoo!
215,00:06:46.43,00:06:48.77,A lot of stuff brought out on
216,00:06:48.80,00:06:50.73,"the table, it was funny."
217,00:06:50.77,00:06:53.03,I'm not okay with that vote.
218,00:06:53.07,00:06:54.23,Forget it. Nope.

652,00:20:07.30,00:20:07.63,>> Okay.
653,00:20:07.67,00:20:09.07,>> I would say vote off Neleh.
654,00:20:09.10,00:20:10.23,If you don't feel that's
655,00:20:10.27,00:20:10.60,right...
656,00:20:10.63,00:20:11.50,">> No, that's fine."
657,00:20:11.53,00:20:12.97,>> ...we can vote Paschal then.
658,00:20:13.00,00:20:14.37,>> PROBST: Do you guys have a
659,00:20:14.40,00:20:14.60,plan?
660,00:20:14.63,00:20:14.97,>> Yeah.
661,00:20:15.00,00:20:15.73,>> PROBST: Okay.
662,00:20:15.77,00:20:16.83,Thoughts from you guys?
663,00:20:16.87,00:20:18.37,">> I mean, you know, Paschal and"
664,00:20:18.40,00:20:19.73,I have come this far together
665,00:20:19.77,00:20:21.23,"and whether it's me or Paschal,"
666,00:20:21.27,00:20:21.97,I don't care.
667,00:20:22.00,00:20:22.97,>> PROBST: Kathy?
668,00:20:23.00,00:20:24.70,>> I always knew that I was on
669,00:20:24.73,00:20:26.37,the chopping block when I got
670,00:20:26.40,00:20:28.00,down to the final three with
671,00:20:28.03,00:20:29.83,"Neleh and Paschal, and it's very"
672,00:20:29.87,00:20:31.63,difficult to make the decisions
673,00:20:31.67,00:20:33.20,because they're very tight.
674,00:20:33.23,00:20:35.00,As you can see my voice is even
675,00:20:35.03,00:20:39.00,quivering.
676,00:20:39.03,00:20:42.37,So that's it.
677,00:20:42.40,00:20:43.43,>> PROBST: Okay.
678,00:20:43.47,00:20:45.03,It is now time to vote.
679,00:20:45.07,00:20:47.63,"Paschal, you first."
680,00:20:47.67,00:20:50.17,>> Don't worry.
681,00:21:04.47,00:21:07.50,Simply an amazing woman.
682,00:21:33.63,00:21:35.63,">> Kathy, my vote tonight is for"
683,00:21:35.67,00:21:36.23,you.
684,00:21:36.27,00:21:37.67,"I said I would never, ever vote"
685,00:21:37.70,00:21:38.40,against Paschal.
686,00:21:38.43,00:21:39.73,Looks like it's going to be a
687,00:21:39.77,00:21:41.20,"tie-breaker, and I'm definitely"
688,00:21:41.23,00:21:43.73,not ready to leave.
689,00:21:48.27,00:21:49.70,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
690,00:21:49.73,00:21:51.93,votes.
691,00:22:03.67,00:22:05.37,"Once the votes are read, the"
692,00:22:05.40,00:22:06.67,decision is final.
693,00:22:06.70,00:22:07.93,The person will be asked to
694,00:22:07.97,00:22:09.27,leave the Tribal Council area
695,00:22:09.30,00:22:09.83,immediately.
696,00:22:09.87,00:22:12.07,I'll read the votes.
697,00:22:12.10,00:22:15.37,"First vote, Neleh."
698,00:22:19.23,00:22:20.33,Kathy.
699,00:22:20.37,00:22:22.50,"One vote Neleh, one vote Kathy."
700,00:22:25.57,00:22:27.07,Kathy.
701,00:22:27.10,00:22:29.90,Last vote.
702,00:22:29.93,00:22:31.53,Neleh.
703,00:22:31.57,00:22:35.27,We're tied two votes each.
704,00:22:35.30,00:22:36.57,Okay.
705,00:22:36.60,00:22:38.20,Here's how a tie-breaker works.
706,00:22:38.23,00:22:39.67,Previous votes don't count.
707,00:22:39.70,00:22:40.57,There's no Q & A.
708,00:22:40.60,00:22:41.90,I'm going to give you two
709,00:22:41.93,00:22:43.47,minutes to discuss who should
710,00:22:43.50,00:22:44.67,stay and who should go.
711,00:22:44.70,00:22:46.30,"At the end of two minutes, you"
712,00:22:46.33,00:22:47.73,need to come to a unanimous
713,00:22:47.77,00:22:49.30,decision as to whether you're
714,00:22:49.33,00:22:51.13,voting out Neleh or Kathy.
715,00:22:51.17,00:22:53.37,"If there's no consensus, it will"
716,00:22:53.40,00:22:55.63,come down to what's in this bag.
717,00:22:55.67,00:22:56.90,Three rocks in it.
718,00:22:56.93,00:22:58.90,"Two rocks are yellow, that's"
719,00:22:58.93,00:22:59.67,safe.
720,00:22:59.70,00:23:01.17,One rock is purple and that
721,00:23:01.20,00:23:02.70,means you're out of the game.
722,00:23:02.73,00:23:04.30,The only person who won't have
723,00:23:04.33,00:23:05.90,to reach into this bag tonight
724,00:23:05.93,00:23:06.40,is V.
725,00:23:06.43,00:23:07.53,She has immunity.
726,00:23:07.57,00:23:09.30,So you have two minutes to
727,00:23:09.33,00:23:11.40,decide yourselves or it goes to
728,00:23:11.43,00:23:13.50,"chance, which is a lousy way to"
729,00:23:13.53,00:23:14.47,leave after 37 days.
730,00:23:14.50,00:23:15.03,>> I agree.
731,00:23:15.07,00:23:16.50,">> Well, I've played this game"
732,00:23:16.53,00:23:17.37,"honestly, fairly."
733,00:23:17.40,00:23:18.83,"You know, the entire time I've"
734,00:23:18.87,00:23:20.23,loved every single minute of
735,00:23:20.27,00:23:21.37,this whole entire game.
736,00:23:21.40,00:23:22.80,"If I leave tonight, I'm gonna"
737,00:23:22.83,00:23:24.17,leave with a smile and high
738,00:23:24.20,00:23:24.43,head.
739,00:23:24.47,00:23:26.03,">> Um, I think I worked hard."
740,00:23:26.07,00:23:27.80,I think I was very honest and it
741,00:23:27.83,00:23:29.47,was just hard to jockey around
742,00:23:29.50,00:23:31.23,"your pact, so I think I provided"
743,00:23:31.27,00:23:32.70,well and I got food and the
744,00:23:32.73,00:23:34.13,adventure that I just went
745,00:23:34.17,00:23:35.77,through is going to change my
746,00:23:35.80,00:23:36.53,life back at home.
747,00:23:36.57,00:23:37.80,">> Neleh, not taking anything"
748,00:23:37.83,00:23:39.03,"from you, I love your spirit."
749,00:23:39.07,00:23:39.40,>> Yeah.
750,00:23:39.43,00:23:40.73,>> And I thank goodness that it
751,00:23:40.77,00:23:42.13,"was there, but I have to go with"
752,00:23:42.17,00:23:42.77,Kathy.
753,00:23:42.80,00:23:43.43,>> Paschal?
754,00:23:43.47,00:23:45.13,>> You've got to look at the
755,00:23:45.17,00:23:47.10,ultimate goal in this and that's
756,00:23:47.13,00:23:48.47,to stay in at the end.
757,00:23:48.50,00:23:50.20,I think whoever's making the
758,00:23:50.23,00:23:52.17,decision would be foolish to put
759,00:23:52.20,00:23:53.87,"Kathy in the finals, because"
760,00:23:53.90,00:23:55.40,Kathy is quite capable of
761,00:23:55.43,00:23:57.33,"winning any immunity, much more"
762,00:23:57.37,00:23:57.97,so than Neleh.
763,00:23:58.00,00:23:59.37,">> We can't do unanimous, it's"
764,00:23:59.40,00:24:00.27,not going to work.
765,00:24:00.30,00:24:01.60,">> So, we have to draw rocks."
766,00:24:01.63,00:24:02.77,">> Yep, which is too bad."
767,00:24:02.80,00:24:04.13,>> PROBST: Where you guys at?
768,00:24:04.17,00:24:05.03,>> Drawing rocks.
769,00:24:05.07,00:24:06.63,">> Drawing rocks, to me, seems"
770,00:24:06.67,00:24:07.83,like the fairest thing.
771,00:24:07.87,00:24:09.33,>> PROBST: It's fair for you
772,00:24:09.37,00:24:09.60,guys.
773,00:24:09.63,00:24:11.23,"Paschal, a guy who had no votes"
774,00:24:11.27,00:24:12.97,"cast tonight, is now vulnerable."
775,00:24:13.00,00:24:14.43,So because together you guys
776,00:24:14.47,00:24:16.03,couldn't make a decision as to
777,00:24:16.07,00:24:17.73,"who to vote out, it's now out of"
778,00:24:17.77,00:24:18.33,your hands.
779,00:24:18.37,00:24:19.97,You're leaving it up to chance.
780,00:24:20.00,00:24:21.57,Here's what's going to happen.
781,00:24:21.60,00:24:23.27,"Neleh, first you'll grab a rock,"
782,00:24:23.30,00:24:24.60,"then Kathy, then Paschal."
783,00:24:24.63,00:24:25.90,Very important you don't
784,00:24:25.93,00:24:26.83,look at the rock.
785,00:24:26.87,00:24:28.47,"When I tell you to, you'll all"
786,00:24:28.50,00:24:29.97,three put your hands in the
787,00:24:30.00,00:24:31.20,middle and open it up.
788,00:24:31.23,00:24:31.83,Here I come.
789,00:24:31.87,00:24:32.53,>> All right.
790,00:24:32.57,00:24:33.27,>> Good luck.
791,00:24:33.30,00:24:34.57,">> Good luck, everybody."
792,00:24:34.60,00:24:36.00,>> PROBST: Yellow is safe.
793,00:24:36.03,00:24:38.90,Purple means you're going home.
794,00:24:46.37,00:24:47.80,">> Well, that feels like purple,"
795,00:24:47.83,00:24:49.00,Jeff.
796,00:24:49.03,00:24:51.97,(laughter)

798,00:24:54.17,00:24:55.20,I got ourselves into this gnarly
799,00:24:55.23,00:24:56.17,mess.

867,00:27:17.83,00:27:18.17,mates.
868,00:27:18.20,00:27:19.73,"Finally, you will cleanse"
869,00:27:19.77,00:27:21.33,yourself with a Marquesan
870,00:27:21.37,00:27:22.90,"purification bath, before"
871,00:27:22.93,00:27:24.87,meeting me at the final part of
872,00:27:24.90,00:27:26.40,your immunity challenge.
873,00:27:26.43,00:27:27.00,All right?
874,00:27:27.03,00:27:28.97,Here's a map with your journey.
875,00:27:29.00,00:27:30.67,I suggest you build a fire.
876,00:27:30.70,00:27:32.57,"It's a long day, and you'll be"
877,00:27:32.60,00:27:34.97,leaving here in an hour.
878,00:27:35.00,00:27:36.33,">> So, where's the"
879,00:27:36.37,00:27:37.13,Soliantu camp?
880,00:27:37.17,00:27:38.67,Where's Challenge Beach?
881,00:27:38.70,00:27:40.30,>> This is challenge immunity
882,00:27:40.33,00:27:41.00,right there.
883,00:27:41.03,00:27:41.87,>> Right there.
884,00:27:41.90,00:27:43.40,Anything else that it says?
885,00:27:43.43,00:27:44.47,I'm blind as a bat.
886,00:27:44.50,00:27:45.90,">> It just says ""mountain"
887,00:27:45.93,00:27:46.30,"range."""
888,00:27:46.33,00:27:46.77,>> Yeah.
889,00:27:46.80,00:27:47.23,>> Okay.
890,00:27:47.27,00:27:48.53,>> First we have to disassemble
891,00:27:48.57,00:27:49.00,a raft?
892,00:27:49.03,00:27:51.00,">> No, we have to assemble an"
893,00:27:51.03,00:27:51.57,outrigger.
894,00:27:51.60,00:27:53.27,>> Putting the outrigger canoe
895,00:27:53.30,00:27:54.63,together was quite easy.
896,00:27:54.67,00:27:56.47,Myself and Kathy are pretty good
897,00:27:56.50,00:27:57.10,knot-tyers.
898,00:27:57.13,00:27:58.93,>> Go around this way to tighten
899,00:27:58.97,00:28:00.93,it up once.
900,00:28:00.93,00:28:04.13,">> We kind of like just steppedup, put that rigger canoe"
901,00:28:04.13,00:28:05.73,"together, like the chicks that"
902,00:28:05.77,00:28:07.53,"we are, and Neleh went ahead and"
903,00:28:07.57,00:28:09.03,"prepared the water, got the"
904,00:28:09.07,00:28:10.93,canteens ready.
905,00:28:10.93,00:28:13.60,">> The key is, does that go tothe stern or the bow?"
906,00:28:13.60,00:28:13.93,
907,00:28:13.97,00:28:14.97,"Okay, I got it."
908,00:28:15.00,00:28:16.83,This will go over the canoe like
909,00:28:16.87,00:28:17.17,this.
910,00:28:17.20,00:28:17.63,>> Yup.
911,00:28:17.67,00:28:18.77,">> Yep, perfect."
912,00:28:18.80,00:28:20.53,">> So, three women working"
913,00:28:20.57,00:28:22.47,"together, those heads worked"
914,00:28:22.50,00:28:24.40,"pretty dang good together, I"
915,00:28:24.43,00:28:25.40,should say so.
916,00:28:25.43,00:28:29.33,>> Take it slow.
917,00:28:29.37,00:28:31.07,">> I can't find the words yet,"
918,00:28:31.10,00:28:32.70,what it's like to be on that
919,00:28:32.73,00:28:33.90,beach for that long.
920,00:28:33.93,00:28:35.83,">> Okay, girls, you ready?"
921,00:28:35.83,00:28:38.80,">> Paddling away from it, and weknew something was ahead of us"
922,00:28:38.80,00:28:40.13,that was going to be probably
923,00:28:40.17,00:28:41.40,challenging but also really
924,00:28:41.43,00:28:42.83,good.
925,00:28:42.83,00:28:45.80,"It felt great.It was exhilarating, it was fun,"
926,00:28:45.80,00:28:47.60,it was a sense of release and
927,00:28:47.63,00:28:48.00,power.
928,00:28:48.03,00:28:49.63,">> Guys, as we're going, I'm"
929,00:28:49.67,00:28:50.93,going to say a prayer.
930,00:28:50.97,00:28:52.83,"Father God, in the name of Jesus"
931,00:28:52.87,00:28:55.77,I thank you for...
932,00:29:16.50,00:29:18.93,(indistinct shouting)
933,00:29:31.47,00:29:33.17,>> All right.
934,00:29:33.20,00:29:34.93,">> All right, woman."
935,00:29:34.97,00:29:38.13,>> It's so exciting.
936,00:29:38.17,00:29:40.07,">> You guys, this is so neat."
937,00:29:40.10,00:29:42.07,"Seriously, what an experience."
938,00:29:42.10,00:29:42.70,You know?
939,00:29:42.73,00:29:43.17,>> Yep.
940,00:29:43.20,00:29:45.27,">> You guys, this looks like it"
941,00:29:45.30,00:29:46.00,right here.
942,00:29:46.03,00:29:47.27,>> This is so cool!
943,00:29:47.30,00:29:49.17,>> We'll all do fun stuff on
944,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.93,each other.
945,00:29:49.97,00:29:50.30,>> Whoo!
946,00:29:50.33,00:29:51.67,">> I don't want to talk now,"
947,00:29:51.70,00:29:52.93,because I don't want to...
948,00:29:52.97,00:29:53.43,I'm just...
949,00:29:53.47,00:29:53.93,>> I know.
950,00:29:53.97,00:29:54.87,>> ...reflecting on
951,00:29:54.90,00:29:55.40,everything.
952,00:29:55.43,00:29:55.77,>> I am.
953,00:29:55.80,00:29:56.40,">> I am, too."
954,00:29:56.43,00:29:57.60,"I am reflecting, totally."
955,00:29:57.63,00:29:58.53,">> Oh, I love this."
956,00:29:58.57,00:30:00.07,"Seriously, every step I go along"
957,00:30:00.10,00:30:01.43,I just love it more and more
958,00:30:01.47,00:30:02.83,and it means more and more to
959,00:30:02.87,00:30:03.47,"me, you know?"
960,00:30:03.50,00:30:06.57,My tattoos mean a ton of stuff.
961,00:30:06.57,00:30:07.83,"is mainly, like, my family,"
962,00:30:07.87,00:30:09.33,because they're by far the most
963,00:30:09.37,00:30:10.60,important thing in this
964,00:30:10.63,00:30:12.57,entire world to me.
965,00:30:12.57,00:30:15.47,"My leg, of course, this is myoriginal Rotu tribe that I"
966,00:30:15.47,00:30:16.83,"started out with, and I put"
967,00:30:16.87,00:30:17.90,"""love"" just because I"
968,00:30:17.93,00:30:19.27,seriously love every single
969,00:30:19.30,00:30:20.77,person that I've met out here
970,00:30:20.80,00:30:22.30,and I love the experience that
971,00:30:22.33,00:30:23.47,I've been able to have.
972,00:30:23.50,00:30:24.00,(laughter)
973,00:30:24.03,00:30:25.53,>> When I think of some of the
974,00:30:25.57,00:30:26.80,"people, if they were here"
975,00:30:26.83,00:30:28.30,"watching me, they'd think I'm"
976,00:30:28.33,00:30:29.93,insane because they wouldn't get
977,00:30:29.97,00:30:30.10,it.
978,00:30:30.13,00:30:31.53,>> They're going to love it.
979,00:30:31.57,00:30:33.07,>> But they still wouldn't get
980,00:30:33.10,00:30:33.20,it.
981,00:30:33.23,00:30:34.43,"Like, have you lost your"
982,00:30:34.47,00:30:34.87,marbles?
983,00:30:34.90,00:30:36.20,">> No, that was yesterday,"
984,00:30:36.23,00:30:36.60,Kathy.
985,00:30:36.63,00:30:38.83,>> I lost my marbles yesterday?
986,00:30:38.87,00:30:41.00,>> I have 16 tribes members on
987,00:30:41.03,00:30:42.07,my leg dancing.
988,00:30:42.10,00:30:44.30,"A waterfall, because it gave me"
989,00:30:44.33,00:30:46.60,so much strength during the hard
990,00:30:46.63,00:30:47.00,times.
991,00:30:47.03,00:30:49.17,The sun showering down upon us
992,00:30:49.20,00:30:50.90,into a little love fest.
993,00:30:50.93,00:30:52.60,>> Does that look right?
994,00:30:52.63,00:30:53.10,Vision?
995,00:30:53.13,00:30:55.07,"Did I spell ""vision"" right?"
996,00:30:55.10,00:30:56.93,>> I can't see. (chuckles)
997,00:30:56.97,00:30:58.60,>> I saw tattooing as an
998,00:30:58.63,00:31:00.70,opportunity for me to reflect
999,00:31:00.73,00:31:02.93,personally on my own odyssey.
1000,00:31:02.93,00:31:05.00,This is supposed to be 16people representing fire.
1001,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.60,
1002,00:31:05.63,00:31:07.30,Each one has the person's name
1003,00:31:07.33,00:31:08.93,and the number in which they
1004,00:31:08.97,00:31:10.40,have been voted off.
1005,00:31:10.43,00:31:12.17,"Peter one, Patricia two,"
1006,00:31:12.20,00:31:12.83,Hunter...
1007,00:31:12.87,00:31:15.23,"It stops at number 13, which was"
1008,00:31:15.27,00:31:15.97,Paschal English.
1009,00:31:16.00,00:31:17.43,It was so funny because the Rotu
1010,00:31:17.47,00:31:18.77,people asked me if there was
1011,00:31:18.80,00:31:20.10,anybody I would like to be in
1012,00:31:20.13,00:31:21.53,the finals with who would it be
1013,00:31:21.57,00:31:23.03,"and I said with Kathy, you know."
1014,00:31:23.07,00:31:24.43,"We both have a 50-50 shot, I'd"
1015,00:31:24.47,00:31:24.60,say.
1016,00:31:24.63,00:31:25.00,>> Yeah.
1017,00:31:25.03,00:31:26.33,>> But as far as deserving of
1018,00:31:26.37,00:31:26.57,it...
1019,00:31:26.60,00:31:27.30,">> Yeah, yeah..."
1020,00:31:27.33,00:31:28.23,>> ...to be up there...
1021,00:31:28.27,00:31:28.60,>> Yeah.
1022,00:31:28.63,00:31:29.67,>> ...definitely Kathy.
1023,00:31:29.70,00:31:30.77,>> You haven't won yet.
1024,00:31:30.80,00:31:31.37,>> Thank you.
1025,00:31:31.40,00:31:31.67,>> Huh?
1026,00:31:31.70,00:31:32.97,>> You guys haven't won yet.
1027,00:31:33.00,00:31:33.90,>> What do you mean?
1028,00:31:33.93,00:31:35.13,">> Oh, no, we were just in"
1029,00:31:35.17,00:31:35.43,theory.
1030,00:31:35.47,00:31:35.90,>> Yeah...
1031,00:31:35.93,00:31:36.77,>> Just in theory.
1032,00:31:36.80,00:31:38.33,">> Right now, I mean, there's a"
1033,00:31:38.37,00:31:40.00,"lot of arrogance in the air, you"
1034,00:31:40.03,00:31:41.33,"know, between V and Kathy."
1035,00:31:41.37,00:31:42.97,It's been kind of annoying today
1036,00:31:43.00,00:31:44.50,"to tell you the truth, sitting"
1037,00:31:44.53,00:31:46.10,over there on the mat finishing
1038,00:31:46.13,00:31:47.73,"up my tattooing and hearing, you"
1039,00:31:47.77,00:31:49.27,"know, her tell Kathy ""Oh, if I"
1040,00:31:49.30,00:31:50.70,"would have, you know, had to"
1041,00:31:50.73,00:31:52.30,make it to the two I definitely
1042,00:31:52.33,00:31:53.93,"knew it was going to be you"" and"
1043,00:31:53.97,00:31:54.73,all this drama.
1044,00:31:54.77,00:31:56.30,It's like throwing it in your
1045,00:31:56.33,00:31:58.03,face which I don't think is very
1046,00:31:58.07,00:32:01.70,good sportsmanship.
1047,00:34:52.43,00:34:55.07,>> (sobbing): I love you.
1048,00:35:50.40,00:35:52.20,>> I don't think we're thereyet.
1049,00:35:52.20,00:35:53.33,You guys okay back there?
1050,00:35:53.37,00:35:54.03,>> Uh-huh.
1051,00:35:54.07,00:35:55.33,>> Yep.
1052,00:35:55.37,00:35:56.97,>> We got off the ridge and we
1053,00:35:57.00,00:35:58.03,hiked to an area of
1054,00:35:58.07,00:35:59.97,purification.
1055,00:35:59.97,00:36:02.60,">> Oh, wow.>> This is wild."
1056,00:36:02.60,00:36:05.50,">> Apparently, the Marquesans do"
1057,00:36:05.53,00:36:08.17,some type of baptismal ritual
1058,00:36:08.20,00:36:10.73,"with manui oils, ginger, and"
1059,00:36:10.77,00:36:12.03,God knows what else.
1060,00:36:12.07,00:36:13.53,">> God, it smells good."
1061,00:36:13.57,00:36:15.43,">> You guys, we need to say a"
1062,00:36:15.47,00:36:16.53,prayer over this.
1063,00:36:16.57,00:36:17.47,">> Yes, we do."
1064,00:36:17.50,00:36:19.80,>> So being that this was really
1065,00:36:19.83,00:36:22.10,"the last rites, in a way, of us"
1066,00:36:22.13,00:36:24.40,"being here, we took a moment of"
1067,00:36:24.43,00:36:26.47,prayer to recall our journey
1068,00:36:26.50,00:36:27.83,from the beginning of the day.
1069,00:36:27.87,00:36:29.03,>> We're so grateful for the
1070,00:36:29.07,00:36:30.40,strength to get this far and

1072,00:36:31.77,00:36:31.93,had.

1075,00:36:33.90,00:36:35.33,time that we have to be together
1076,00:36:35.37,00:36:36.47,and please watch over and

1292,00:44:24.57,00:44:26.13,"in 38 days, not going to hide"
1293,00:44:26.17,00:44:27.37,anything from you now.
1294,00:44:27.40,00:44:29.13,Just before Tribal Council was
1295,00:44:29.17,00:44:33.43,"to begin, Paschal collapsed."
1296,00:44:33.47,00:44:36.70,He's been evacuated to medical
1297,00:44:36.73,00:44:38.20,care.
1298,00:44:38.23,00:44:40.40,"He's in excellent hands, and,"
1299,00:44:40.43,00:44:42.77,"luckily for us, one of your own"
1300,00:44:42.80,00:44:44.53,tribe members is also a
1301,00:44:44.57,00:44:45.43,registered nurse.
1302,00:44:45.47,00:44:46.83,"John was there, and if you"
1303,00:44:46.87,00:44:48.30,"wouldn't mind, this is your"
1304,00:44:48.33,00:44:49.00,tribe.
1305,00:44:49.03,00:44:50.77,Would you just put their minds
1306,00:44:50.80,00:44:52.30,at ease and tell them what
1307,00:44:52.33,00:44:53.60,happened with Paschal?
1308,00:44:53.63,00:44:55.27,>> Shortly before we came here
1309,00:44:55.30,00:44:56.70,he basically just kind of
1310,00:44:56.73,00:44:58.33,"fainted on his feet, and he's"
1311,00:44:58.37,00:44:59.53,just showing signs of
1312,00:44:59.57,00:45:00.27,dehydration.
1313,00:45:00.30,00:45:01.87,Everything looked real good.
1314,00:45:01.90,00:45:03.33,He's within normal limits.
1315,00:45:03.37,00:45:05.13,"He was talking, he was alert, he"
1316,00:45:05.17,00:45:06.13,knew where he was.
1317,00:45:06.17,00:45:07.80,"So we said a prayer, and he's"
1318,00:45:07.83,00:45:08.77,going to be okay.
1319,00:45:08.80,00:45:10.73,Okay? Okay.
1320,00:45:10.77,00:45:12.37,>> I'm just glad he's okay.
1321,00:45:12.40,00:45:13.33,">> Yeah. I'm glad he's okay,"
1322,00:45:13.37,00:45:14.07,too.
1323,00:45:14.10,00:45:15.20,>> PROBST: We have a Tribal
1324,00:45:15.23,00:45:16.07,Council to deal with.
1325,00:45:16.10,00:45:17.20,If you guys are okay to go
1326,00:45:17.23,00:45:18.20,ahead?
1327,00:45:18.23,00:45:20.00,Long day.
1328,00:45:20.03,00:45:22.57,Highs and lows for everybody.
1329,00:45:22.60,00:45:25.47,We get to an immunity challenge
1330,00:45:25.50,00:45:27.40,where it really is about
1331,00:45:27.43,00:45:29.10,"willpower, ultimately."
1332,00:45:29.13,00:45:30.60,You guys wanted it.
1333,00:45:30.63,00:45:33.10,"You hung on for a long time, and"
1334,00:45:33.13,00:45:35.87,then what happens?
1335,00:45:35.90,00:45:37.70,>> I just lost my concentration.
1336,00:45:37.73,00:45:39.17,I looked down and I was
1337,00:45:39.20,00:45:40.57,correcting my shirt and I fell
1338,00:45:40.60,00:45:41.73,off.
1339,00:45:41.77,00:45:43.30,So it was totally concentration.
1340,00:45:43.33,00:45:44.47,It was my own fault.
1341,00:45:44.50,00:45:46.17,So it's not a big deal.
1342,00:45:46.20,00:45:47.57,"I, you know, I was getting tired"
1343,00:45:47.60,00:45:49.07,"anyway, I was going to give it"
1344,00:45:49.10,00:45:50.27,one more hour and then I had
1345,00:45:50.30,00:45:51.30,to... I had to cash out.
1346,00:45:51.33,00:45:52.67,">> Yeah, and it was totally... I"
1347,00:45:52.70,00:45:53.73,just did not want herself
1348,00:45:53.77,00:45:54.10,exposed.
1349,00:45:54.13,00:45:54.43,>> Yeah.
1350,00:45:54.47,00:45:55.77,>> It wasn't anything trying to
1351,00:45:55.80,00:45:56.83,lure her off or anything.
1352,00:45:56.87,00:45:58.07,">> No, no, not at all, so..."
1353,00:45:58.10,00:45:59.13,>> PROBST: You fell off the
1354,00:45:59.17,00:45:59.77,stump.
1355,00:45:59.80,00:46:00.43,>> Yeah.
1356,00:46:00.47,00:46:01.90,">> PROBST: Before you know it,"
1357,00:46:01.93,00:46:03.50,"V's made a deal with Neleh, like"
1358,00:46:03.53,00:46:06.10,that.
1359,00:46:06.13,00:46:06.87,>> I know.
1360,00:46:06.90,00:46:08.03,"I was disappointed, because I"
1361,00:46:08.07,00:46:09.23,thought we had a little thing
1362,00:46:09.27,00:46:10.40,"going on, but you know what?"
1363,00:46:10.43,00:46:11.63,What goes around comes around.
1364,00:46:11.67,00:46:12.87,"I negotiated a deal yesterday,"
1365,00:46:12.90,00:46:14.03,she negotiated a deal today.
1366,00:46:14.07,00:46:15.13,It seems like that's what's
1367,00:46:15.17,00:46:16.13,happening with the game.
1368,00:46:16.17,00:46:17.30,We're doing deals every five
1369,00:46:17.33,00:46:17.67,hours.
1370,00:46:17.70,00:46:19.07,"So, I was disappointed."
1371,00:46:19.10,00:46:20.97,I thought we were going to ride
1372,00:46:21.00,00:46:22.87,"it but, you know what, c'est la"
1373,00:46:22.90,00:46:24.17,"vie, what can you do?"
1374,00:46:24.20,00:46:26.20,">> PROBST: Vecepia, what was"
1375,00:46:26.23,00:46:28.53,your obligation to Kathy at that
1376,00:46:28.57,00:46:29.00,point?
1377,00:46:29.03,00:46:31.23,">> To be honest, um, when I"
1378,00:46:31.27,00:46:33.70,think about what we discussed
1379,00:46:33.73,00:46:35.77,"yesterday, I don't recall"
1380,00:46:35.80,00:46:38.07,anything about me trying to
1381,00:46:38.10,00:46:39.00,carry her.
1382,00:46:39.03,00:46:39.90,>> Hmm...
1383,00:46:39.93,00:46:41.53,>> When she told me that she was
1384,00:46:41.57,00:46:43.17,"having cramps I said, ""Well, how"
1385,00:46:43.20,00:46:44.50,"much longer can you last?"""
1386,00:46:44.53,00:46:45.93,But then all of a sudden she
1387,00:46:45.97,00:46:47.47,"fell, and then at that point I"
1388,00:46:47.50,00:46:49.07,"was, like, ""Okay, so am I... am"
1389,00:46:49.10,00:46:49.83,I carrying her?
1390,00:46:49.87,00:46:51.37,Is that part of our agreement?
1391,00:46:51.40,00:46:52.10,"I'm not sure."""
1392,00:46:52.13,00:46:53.43,">> Well, I thought we did."
1393,00:46:53.47,00:46:54.77,I actually thought we did.
1394,00:46:54.80,00:46:56.37,">> And I said at that time, the"
1395,00:46:56.40,00:46:57.83,"best thing to do... I mean, I"
1396,00:46:57.87,00:46:59.40,could have stayed up there for
1397,00:46:59.43,00:47:00.50,another three hours.
1398,00:47:00.53,00:47:02.43,"I was okay, but I said, you"
1399,00:47:02.47,00:47:04.73,"know, the best thing to do right"
1400,00:47:04.77,00:47:06.90,"now, we can stop this charade."
1401,00:47:06.93,00:47:09.17,"I can just ask ""Neleh, hey, you"
1402,00:47:09.20,00:47:10.23,want to end it?
1403,00:47:10.27,00:47:12.33,I'll give you the immunity if
1404,00:47:12.37,00:47:13.93,"you give me the spot."""
1405,00:47:13.97,00:47:14.77,And so I did that.
1406,00:47:14.80,00:47:16.33,">> PROBST: Neleh, were you going"
1407,00:47:16.37,00:47:16.93,to outlast V?
1408,00:47:16.97,00:47:18.43,">> You know, I was not going to"
1409,00:47:18.47,00:47:19.90,go down today without a fight.
1410,00:47:19.93,00:47:21.37,I've been on the chopping board
1411,00:47:21.40,00:47:22.20,for two days now.
1412,00:47:22.23,00:47:23.63,All day long I have known that
1413,00:47:23.67,00:47:25.03,if I didn't win this immunity
1414,00:47:25.07,00:47:26.53,"tonight, that I was going to be"
1415,00:47:26.57,00:47:27.70,the one that was leaving
1416,00:47:27.73,00:47:28.23,tonight.
1417,00:47:28.27,00:47:30.33,And I wasn't about to give up.
1418,00:47:30.37,00:47:32.37,"And so, you know, when it was"
1419,00:47:32.40,00:47:34.47,"offered to me, definitely, you"
1420,00:47:34.50,00:47:35.60,"know, I took it."
1421,00:47:35.63,00:47:36.90,>> PROBST: Let me ask you a
1422,00:47:36.93,00:47:37.70,question.
1423,00:47:37.73,00:47:39.20,Both you and V have been very
1424,00:47:39.23,00:47:40.80,open and very vocal about your
1425,00:47:40.83,00:47:42.23,"beliefs, spiritual beliefs,"
1426,00:47:42.27,00:47:43.40,religious beliefs.
1427,00:47:43.43,00:47:45.40,"Kathy, faith play any part for"
1428,00:47:45.43,00:47:46.27,you out here?
1429,00:47:46.30,00:47:46.83,>> Yeah.
1430,00:47:46.87,00:47:48.33,"I was on those logs, and I was"
1431,00:47:48.37,00:47:49.90,"praying just to get through it,"
1432,00:47:49.93,00:47:51.03,just to get through it.
1433,00:47:51.07,00:47:52.50,And there were a lot of other
1434,00:47:52.53,00:47:53.97,deep thoughts that were going
1435,00:47:54.00,00:47:55.30,through my mind to keep me
1436,00:47:55.33,00:47:55.80,going.
1437,00:47:55.83,00:47:57.27,>> PROBST: Like what?
1438,00:47:57.30,00:47:59.20,">> Oh, you know, let's see."
1439,00:47:59.23,00:48:01.37,I hung by my dad's bedside for
1440,00:48:01.40,00:48:03.50,five hours while he died and I
1441,00:48:03.53,00:48:05.77,"said, ""If I can do that,"" and he"
1442,00:48:05.80,00:48:07.70,would want me to hang in on
1443,00:48:07.73,00:48:08.47,those logs.
1444,00:48:08.50,00:48:10.47,I really focused on that for
1445,00:48:10.50,00:48:11.60,quite some time.
1446,00:48:11.63,00:48:13.87,In addition to saying the Lord's
1447,00:48:13.90,00:48:15.83,Prayer and also just... just
1448,00:48:15.87,00:48:17.33,talking to my father.
1449,00:48:17.37,00:48:19.40,"It was pretty cool, because I"
1450,00:48:19.43,00:48:20.90,haven't been doing that.
1451,00:48:20.93,00:48:22.63,">> PROBST: Nice feeling, it"
1452,00:48:22.67,00:48:23.33,looks like.
1453,00:48:23.37,00:48:24.37,>> It was great.
1454,00:48:24.40,00:48:26.03,I haven't talked to him in
1455,00:48:26.07,00:48:28.03,years.
1456,00:48:28.07,00:48:31.73,I guess I just had to go deep.
1457,00:48:35.47,00:48:37.93,">> PROBST: Well, a big vote."
1458,00:48:37.97,00:48:40.50,"Kathy, V, you can't vote for"
1459,00:48:40.53,00:48:41.10,Neleh.
1460,00:48:41.13,00:48:42.63,"You can't vote for yourselves,"
1461,00:48:42.67,00:48:44.17,so therefore you can only vote
1462,00:48:44.20,00:48:45.67,"for each other, so you cancel"
1463,00:48:45.70,00:48:46.60,each other out.
1464,00:48:46.63,00:48:47.57,You won't vote.
1465,00:48:47.60,00:48:49.40,Neleh will be the only person
1466,00:48:49.43,00:48:50.33,casting a vote.
1467,00:48:50.37,00:48:52.37,"Interesting thing is, within the"
1468,00:48:52.40,00:48:54.27,"last two Tribal Councils, each"
1469,00:48:54.30,00:48:56.10,one of you at different times
1470,00:48:56.13,00:48:57.97,"has either changed your mind,"
1471,00:48:58.00,00:48:59.93,"offered to change your mind, or"
1472,00:48:59.97,00:49:01.67,considered changing your mind
1473,00:49:01.70,00:49:03.37,about who you were going to vote
1474,00:49:03.40,00:49:03.93,for.
1475,00:49:03.97,00:49:05.63,"The question now is, will Neleh"
1476,00:49:05.67,00:49:06.53,change her mind?
1477,00:49:06.57,00:49:07.60,It is time to vote.
1478,00:49:07.63,00:49:10.50,"Neleh, you're up."
1479,00:49:29.80,00:49:31.90,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
1480,00:49:31.93,00:49:34.17,vote.
1481,00:49:48.77,00:49:50.47,"Once the vote is read, the"
1482,00:49:50.50,00:49:51.63,decision is final.
1483,00:49:51.67,00:49:52.73,The person will be asked to
1484,00:49:52.77,00:49:53.80,leave the Tribal Council area
1485,00:49:53.83,00:49:55.33,immediately.
1486,00:49:55.37,00:49:57.33,I'll read the vote.
1487,00:50:00.40,00:50:02.50,The 14th person voted out of the
1488,00:50:02.53,00:50:05.30,tribe...
1489,00:50:07.63,00:50:08.50,Kathy.
1490,00:50:08.53,00:50:12.27,">> Good luck, you guys."
1491,00:50:12.30,00:50:14.33,(sighs)
1492,00:50:18.20,00:50:20.67,">> PROBST: Kathy, the tribe has"
1493,00:50:20.70,00:50:24.83,spoken.
1494,00:50:24.87,00:50:26.27,">> All right, Jeff."
1495,00:50:26.30,00:50:27.07,Thank you.
1496,00:50:27.10,00:50:28.30,See you guys.
1497,00:50:28.33,00:50:30.47,>> PROBST: So long.
1498,00:50:42.27,00:50:44.30,Here's where we're at.
1499,00:50:44.33,00:50:46.60,You two have done what 14 others
1500,00:50:46.63,00:50:48.17,failed to do.
1501,00:50:48.20,00:50:50.07,You've gone as far as you can go
1502,00:50:50.10,00:50:52.47,in this game on your own power.
1503,00:50:52.50,00:50:55.07,This game now shifts from you to
1504,00:50:55.10,00:50:57.23,the seven members of the jury.
1505,00:50:57.27,00:50:59.03,Seven people who you had a hand
1506,00:50:59.07,00:51:01.20,in voting out will now have a
1507,00:51:01.23,00:51:02.87,hand in deciding which one of
1508,00:51:02.90,00:51:04.77,you two wins this thing.
1509,00:51:04.80,00:51:06.70,"You have one night left, one day"
1510,00:51:06.73,00:51:07.67,tomorrow.
1511,00:51:07.70,00:51:09.03,Drink it in.
1512,00:51:09.07,00:51:10.70,There's nothing left to do.
1513,00:51:10.73,00:51:12.30,"Take your torches, head back to"
1514,00:51:12.33,00:51:13.37,camp.
1515,00:51:13.40,00:51:14.40,I'll most definitely see you
1516,00:51:14.43,00:51:16.77,tomorrow.
1517,00:51:18.97,00:51:20.90,>> 16 total American strangers
1518,00:51:20.93,00:51:21.93,hit this island.
1519,00:51:21.97,00:51:23.93,"First thing off the bat, we're"
1520,00:51:23.97,00:51:25.10,working as a team.
1521,00:51:25.13,00:51:26.77,It was done with positive
1522,00:51:26.80,00:51:28.40,"attitudes, integrity..."
1523,00:51:28.43,00:51:30.30,"Honesty, uh, it might have been"
1524,00:51:30.33,00:51:31.77,a little shaky at times.
1525,00:51:31.80,00:51:33.60,It's the relationships and how
1526,00:51:33.63,00:51:35.47,you can improve upon them that
1527,00:51:35.50,00:51:36.53,I'm taking away.
1528,00:51:36.57,00:51:39.63,"But, uh, I loved it."
1529,00:51:53.30,00:51:57.40,>> Oh! I can't believe it.>> What?
1530,00:51:57.40,00:51:58.87,>> We're here.
1531,00:51:58.90,00:52:02.53,I can't believe I'm here.
1532,00:52:08.80,00:52:11.97,It'll catch any second.
1533,00:52:12.00,00:52:12.80,Yeah.
1534,00:52:12.83,00:52:14.03,>> There we go.
1535,00:52:14.07,00:52:14.77,>> All right.
1536,00:52:14.80,00:52:16.50,You know what? When V said I'll
1537,00:52:16.53,00:52:18.20,give you immunity and then you
1538,00:52:18.23,00:52:19.87,take me to the final two with
1539,00:52:19.90,00:52:21.60,"you, I was planning on bringing"
1540,00:52:21.63,00:52:23.10,V to the final two with me
1541,00:52:23.13,00:52:24.80,"anyways, and so it was like no"
1542,00:52:24.83,00:52:25.30,big deal.
1543,00:52:25.33,00:52:26.67,I know I'd have a better
1544,00:52:26.70,00:52:28.43,shot against V in the final two
1545,00:52:28.47,00:52:30.37,than I would Kathy.
1546,00:52:30.37,00:52:33.47,And whatever deal her and Kathymade was between her because I
1547,00:52:33.47,00:52:33.93,
1548,00:52:33.97,00:52:35.27,was not a part of that.
1549,00:52:35.30,00:52:37.37,And I felt good about it.
1550,00:52:37.40,00:52:38.33,>> All right.
1551,00:52:38.37,00:52:40.57,">> Oh, my heck, we got a fire,"
1552,00:52:40.60,00:52:40.93,girl.
1553,00:52:40.97,00:52:42.20,">> Yes, yes, yes."
1554,00:52:42.23,00:52:44.43,>> Last night together on this
1555,00:52:44.47,00:52:44.97,island.
1556,00:52:45.00,00:52:47.00,>> The reason why I offered
1557,00:52:47.03,00:52:48.93,Neleh the immunity was for
1558,00:52:48.97,00:52:50.13,several reasons.
1559,00:52:50.17,00:52:52.23,I took the risk because once
1560,00:52:52.27,00:52:54.47,"Kathy slipped, I knew that her"
1561,00:52:54.50,00:52:56.87,and I would probably be battling
1562,00:52:56.90,00:52:58.80,for a long time.
1563,00:52:58.80,00:53:00.93,">> Oh!>> Girl, you and I."
1564,00:53:00.93,00:53:01.53,
1565,00:53:01.57,00:53:03.47,>> Had to sit on the tiki thing
1566,00:53:03.50,00:53:04.43,for four hours.
1567,00:53:04.47,00:53:05.23,>> You and I.
1568,00:53:05.27,00:53:06.53,"$100,000, $1 million."
1569,00:53:06.57,00:53:07.50,">> Oh, my gosh."
1570,00:53:07.53,00:53:09.37,>> I was just assuming to make
1571,00:53:09.40,00:53:11.30,"it to the final two with Kathy,"
1572,00:53:11.33,00:53:13.13,because I know Kathy had some
1573,00:53:13.17,00:53:15.00,situations with some people in
1574,00:53:15.03,00:53:16.87,"her old tribe, but then when I"
1575,00:53:16.90,00:53:18.90,"turn it around, I also know that"
1576,00:53:18.93,00:53:20.77,there are a lot of people that
1577,00:53:20.80,00:53:22.70,felt that Neleh has been riding
1578,00:53:22.73,00:53:24.47,coattails and that she's not
1579,00:53:24.50,00:53:26.03,deserving of being in the
1580,00:53:26.07,00:53:27.23,position that she's in.
1581,00:53:27.27,00:53:29.23,"And looking at both scenarios, I"
1582,00:53:29.27,00:53:31.07,knew that my best shot was to
1583,00:53:31.10,00:53:32.93,make it to the final two with
1584,00:53:32.97,00:53:33.30,Neleh.
1585,00:53:33.33,00:53:35.13,"I wish you the best, sweetie."
1586,00:53:35.17,00:53:36.93,">> I wish you the best, too."
1587,00:53:36.97,00:53:37.87,>> I really do.
1588,00:53:37.90,00:53:39.67,"In every game, sometimes you"
1589,00:53:39.70,00:53:41.43,have to make a move that you
1590,00:53:41.47,00:53:42.77,really don't want to.
1591,00:53:42.80,00:53:44.70,But in order to keep the upper
1592,00:53:44.73,00:53:46.10,"hand, you may have to."
1593,00:53:46.13,00:53:48.00,"I myself, I think that's okay."
1594,00:53:48.03,00:53:49.47,I've asked the Lord for
1595,00:53:49.50,00:53:50.23,forgiveness.
1596,00:53:50.27,00:53:52.13,"So, being a Christian, we know"
1597,00:53:52.17,00:53:53.97,we have that ability to go to
1598,00:53:54.00,00:53:55.93,"our father and say, ""Lord, this"
1599,00:53:55.97,00:53:56.83,is what I did.
1600,00:53:56.87,00:53:58.10,I know you saw this.
1601,00:53:58.13,00:54:00.13,Please forgive me and I will go
1602,00:54:00.17,00:54:01.87,to my brother and ask him--
1603,00:54:01.90,00:54:03.77,after it's over with-- and ask
1604,00:54:03.80,00:54:05.67,"him for forgiveness, as well."""
1605,00:54:05.70,00:54:07.20,"Oh, let's say a pray for"
1606,00:54:07.23,00:54:07.73,Pappy real quick.
1607,00:54:07.77,00:54:08.77,">> Oh, yes."
1608,00:54:08.80,00:54:10.03,Our heavenly Father we are so
1609,00:54:10.07,00:54:11.53,grateful for this wonderful day
1610,00:54:11.57,00:54:13.03,and the opportunity that we've
1611,00:54:13.07,00:54:13.70,had.
1612,00:54:13.73,00:54:15.17,"As this night comes to a close,"
1613,00:54:15.20,00:54:16.50,"Heavenly Father, we ask that"
1614,00:54:16.53,00:54:18.03,Thou would please watch over and
1615,00:54:18.07,00:54:19.17,"protect our loved ones,"
1616,00:54:19.20,00:54:20.60,"especially Pappy at this time,"
1617,00:54:20.63,00:54:22.03,"as he is in the hospital, that"
1618,00:54:22.07,00:54:23.23,he may be able to get the
1619,00:54:23.27,00:54:24.73,strength and encouragement that
1620,00:54:24.77,00:54:25.97,he needs so that he may be
1621,00:54:26.00,00:54:26.73,good and strong.
1622,00:54:26.77,00:54:27.97,"If it be Thy will, that he"
1623,00:54:28.00,00:54:29.47,may be able to come to Council
1624,00:54:29.50,00:54:29.90,tomorrow.
1625,00:54:29.93,00:54:30.30,>> Amen.
1626,00:54:30.33,00:54:31.30,>> Thank you.
1627,00:54:31.33,00:54:32.93,"Okay, I'll see you later."
1628,00:54:32.97,00:54:34.13,">> Night, sweetie."
1629,00:54:34.17,00:54:35.93,">> Okay, have a good sleep."
1630,00:54:35.97,00:54:38.80,>> I shall.
1631,00:54:49.50,00:54:52.70,How are you this morning?>> Good. How are you?
1632,00:54:52.70,00:54:53.53,>> Wonderful.
1633,00:54:53.57,00:54:55.43,>> We're going to take a mud
1634,00:54:55.47,00:54:57.43,bath in the waterfall.
1635,00:54:57.47,00:54:58.77,>> Cool.
1636,00:54:58.80,00:55:01.30,"Go get us some apples and taro,"
1637,00:55:01.33,00:55:02.77,get some porridge.
1638,00:55:02.80,00:55:04.40,">> Oh, look at that huge pig."
1639,00:55:04.43,00:55:05.13,Look at that.
1640,00:55:05.17,00:55:06.80,We were just amazed that that
1641,00:55:06.83,00:55:08.27,cute little pig gravitated
1642,00:55:08.30,00:55:09.63,closer and closer to the
1643,00:55:09.67,00:55:10.20,homestead.
1644,00:55:10.23,00:55:11.87,Then we noticed a couple feet
1645,00:55:11.90,00:55:13.70,"from him, two or three chickens."
1646,00:55:13.73,00:55:15.40,We weren't even thinking about
1647,00:55:15.43,00:55:17.23,trying to run after them and try
1648,00:55:17.27,00:55:19.23,catch them.
1649,00:55:19.27,00:55:21.07,It was good to see the pig for
1650,00:55:21.10,00:55:22.90,"the last time, it was great to"
1651,00:55:22.93,00:55:24.67,see the chickens for the last
1652,00:55:24.70,00:55:24.97,time.
1653,00:55:25.00,00:55:26.83,And it was great to get up and
1654,00:55:26.87,00:55:28.73,cook popcorn for the last time.
1655,00:55:28.77,00:55:29.37,>> Mm-mm-mm.
1656,00:55:29.40,00:55:31.10,>> The popcorn of the Marquesas.
1657,00:55:31.13,00:55:32.63,">> I mean, I'm going to miss"
1658,00:55:32.67,00:55:33.20,this place.
1659,00:55:33.23,00:55:34.90,I'm going to miss the beach and
1660,00:55:34.93,00:55:35.37,the sand.
1661,00:55:35.40,00:55:37.10,"You know, I am going to miss the"
1662,00:55:37.13,00:55:38.87,"people that I, you know, became"
1663,00:55:38.90,00:55:42.17,really close to out here.
1664,00:55:42.20,00:55:45.23,Last mud bath together.
1665,00:55:56.27,00:55:59.80,"This place is beautiful, butbeing out here for 39 days, I'm"
1666,00:55:59.80,00:56:01.73,definitely ready to leave it all
1667,00:56:01.77,00:56:04.50,behind.
1668,00:56:04.53,00:56:06.27,Want to burn some stuff with me?
1669,00:56:06.30,00:56:07.80,>> Whose clothes are those?
1670,00:56:07.83,00:56:09.27,">> Oh, John's, Patricia's,"
1671,00:56:09.30,00:56:09.57,Pap's.
1672,00:56:09.60,00:56:11.23,"You know, just start up a little"
1673,00:56:11.27,00:56:12.57,bonfire and burn people's
1674,00:56:12.60,00:56:14.10,clothes that they didn't want
1675,00:56:14.13,00:56:14.50,anymore.
1676,00:56:14.53,00:56:16.13,It just felt good and helped to
1677,00:56:16.17,00:56:16.87,pass the time.
1678,00:56:16.90,00:56:18.50,I'm not returning to this beach
1679,00:56:18.53,00:56:20.03,tonight because everything is
1680,00:56:20.07,00:56:21.17,going to be burned up.
1681,00:56:21.20,00:56:22.70,Here go Pappy's pants that he
1682,00:56:22.73,00:56:23.03,hated.
1683,00:56:23.07,00:56:24.70,"Going to Tribal Council tonight,"
1684,00:56:24.73,00:56:25.63,it's a huge thing.
1685,00:56:25.67,00:56:27.17,The power is no longer within
1686,00:56:27.20,00:56:28.87,"us, you know, to be able to vote"
1687,00:56:28.90,00:56:29.63,each other off.
1688,00:56:29.67,00:56:31.07,The power is totally in the
1689,00:56:31.10,00:56:31.33,jury.
1690,00:56:31.37,00:56:33.00,They are the ones that are going
1691,00:56:33.03,00:56:34.53,to make the ultimate decision
1692,00:56:34.57,00:56:36.07,tonight in who wins a million
1693,00:56:36.10,00:56:36.73,dollars.
1694,00:56:36.77,00:56:39.43,>> Like Christ said when he was
1695,00:56:39.47,00:56:41.87,"hanging on the cross, ""It is"
1696,00:56:41.90,00:56:42.73,"finished."""
1697,00:56:42.77,00:56:44.30,It is almost done.
1698,00:56:44.33,00:56:46.93,I hope that the jury will look
1699,00:56:46.97,00:56:49.70,at the way I played this game as
1700,00:56:49.73,00:56:51.90,"very strategic, extremely"
1701,00:56:51.93,00:56:53.40,"deciseful, in some parts"
1702,00:56:53.43,00:56:55.33,"deceiving, but when you look at"
1703,00:56:55.37,00:56:57.10,"some of the deceptive parts,"
1704,00:56:57.13,00:56:59.07,they have put me in line to get
1705,00:56:59.10,00:57:00.83,"to where I am, and it was a"
1706,00:57:00.87,00:57:02.07,great strategy.
1707,00:57:02.10,00:57:04.73,>> I've been thinking about this
1708,00:57:04.77,00:57:07.30,"all day, you know, who is going"
1709,00:57:07.33,00:57:09.23,to vote for me tonight.
1710,00:57:09.27,00:57:10.67,And all I can do is just say
1711,00:57:10.70,00:57:11.83,"what I, you know, feel."
1712,00:57:11.87,00:57:13.43,I really feel like I have great
1713,00:57:13.47,00:57:14.90,relationships with everybody.
1714,00:57:14.93,00:57:16.40,I hope they'll look at me and
1715,00:57:16.43,00:57:18.03,know that I've been up-front and
1716,00:57:18.07,00:57:19.63,"honest, and hopefully that will"
1717,00:57:19.67,00:57:20.97,work towards my advantage.
1718,00:57:21.00,00:57:23.03,>> This may be the last time
1719,00:57:23.07,00:57:25.30,we'll be able to just look out
1720,00:57:25.33,00:57:27.70,and see the ocean like this from
1721,00:57:27.73,00:57:30.13,this view.
1722,00:57:30.17,00:57:32.70,"We both are ultimate survivors,"
1723,00:57:32.73,00:57:33.13,girl.
1724,00:57:33.17,00:57:34.40,">> Yeah, you know it."
1725,00:57:34.43,00:57:35.13,Here we are.
1726,00:57:35.17,00:57:36.10,>> That's right.
1727,00:57:36.13,00:57:37.43,>> We totally made it.
1728,00:57:37.47,00:57:39.30,I owe it all to the Lord and my
1729,00:57:39.33,00:57:41.23,family and everybody that's just
1730,00:57:41.27,00:57:42.90,kept me so strong out here.
1731,00:57:42.93,00:57:45.90,(laughing)
1732,00:58:15.53,00:58:17.63,>> I think this game was played
1733,00:58:17.67,00:58:18.67,differently.
1734,00:58:18.70,00:58:20.77,I think it was played honestly.
1735,00:58:20.80,00:58:22.93,I don't know what caused two
1736,00:58:22.97,00:58:24.30,Christian women to end up where
1737,00:58:24.33,00:58:25.27,they are.
1738,00:58:25.30,00:58:26.47,It could be faith.
1739,00:58:26.50,00:58:28.00,It could be a lot of things.
1740,00:58:28.03,00:58:31.37,I think it was probably as much
1741,00:58:31.40,00:58:32.57,a camaraderie in a game as I've
1742,00:58:32.60,00:58:34.07,ever noticed.
1743,00:58:34.10,00:58:36.13,An awful lot of it is luck.
1744,00:58:36.17,00:58:37.40,It's hard to make an argument
1745,00:58:37.43,00:58:38.73,that both of them didn't play
1746,00:58:38.77,00:58:40.37,"the game very well, because both"
1747,00:58:40.40,00:58:41.37,of them are right there at the
1748,00:58:41.40,00:58:44.77,end.
1749,00:58:44.80,00:58:47.53,">> Good-bye, stream."
1750,00:58:47.57,00:58:49.93,"Good-bye, coconuts."
1751,00:58:49.97,00:58:51.77,>> Last night I woke up and I
1752,00:58:51.80,00:58:53.40,felt I was in the jungle.
1753,00:58:53.43,00:58:55.10,I looked at the wall and the
1754,00:58:55.13,00:58:56.50,banyan trees and the vines
1755,00:58:56.53,00:58:57.13,were there.
1756,00:58:57.17,00:58:58.73,And I turned on the light and
1757,00:58:58.77,00:58:59.53,they were gone.
1758,00:58:59.57,00:59:01.20,"I am definitely detoxing, and"
1759,00:59:01.23,00:59:02.37,it's freaking me out.
1760,00:59:02.40,00:59:03.87,So when it comes to talking
1761,00:59:03.90,00:59:05.33,"about the vote right now, I"
1762,00:59:05.37,00:59:06.83,can't even process the game
1763,00:59:06.87,00:59:08.47,"right now, except for the fact"
1764,00:59:08.50,00:59:09.87,that I lost and I haven't
1765,00:59:09.90,00:59:11.63,focused on who I'm going to vote
1766,00:59:11.67,00:59:15.67,at the moment.
1767,00:59:15.70,00:59:20.67,">> Bye, chickens and crabs."
1768,00:59:22.77,00:59:24.67,>> To have an all-women's final
1769,00:59:24.70,00:59:26.33,is the best.
1770,00:59:26.37,00:59:28.07,Girls kick ass and I'm glad to
1771,00:59:28.10,00:59:30.23,see it.
1772,00:59:30.27,00:59:31.43,We had some strong men on the
1773,00:59:31.47,00:59:32.57,"team, but you know what?"
1774,00:59:32.60,00:59:34.70,I'd say the women kind of ruled
1775,00:59:34.73,00:59:36.53,the roost.
1776,00:59:36.57,00:59:38.33,I think V and Neleh are both
1777,00:59:38.37,00:59:40.10,well-deserved of the money.
1778,00:59:40.13,00:59:42.03,They both did a hell of a job.
1779,00:59:42.07,00:59:44.00,It is going to be a tough call
1780,00:59:44.03,00:59:47.83,tonight for me.
1781,00:59:50.27,00:59:52.53,">> Well, I can't tell you that I"
1782,00:59:52.57,00:59:54.70,feel good about seeing the two
1783,00:59:54.73,00:59:56.80,"women that are left in there,"
1784,00:59:56.83,00:59:58.97,and knowing that they got past
1785,00:59:59.00,01:00:01.20,"me, that they actually beat me."
1786,01:00:01.23,01:00:03.30,But I'm one of seven who have
1787,01:00:03.33,01:00:04.33,the power now.
1788,01:00:04.37,01:00:06.03,So I'm going to make a
1789,01:00:06.07,01:00:08.40,"decision who goes home $900,000"
1790,01:00:08.43,01:00:09.30,richer.
1791,01:00:09.33,01:00:11.90,That's kind of a little bit of a
1792,01:00:11.93,01:00:14.83,coup for myself.
1793,01:00:18.00,01:00:19.67,>> I hate when you're African-
1794,01:00:19.70,01:00:21.23,American and you talk about
1795,01:00:21.27,01:00:23.07,"race, people say this race card."
1796,01:00:23.10,01:00:24.93,Whoever wins this million is not
1797,01:00:24.97,01:00:26.30,going to be swayed by my
1798,01:00:26.33,01:00:27.47,preference for race.
1799,01:00:27.50,01:00:29.17,Because we are in a game and I
1800,01:00:29.20,01:00:30.80,"am a competitor, I think the"
1801,01:00:30.83,01:00:32.47,best person who played a good
1802,01:00:32.50,01:00:33.37,game should win.
1803,01:00:33.40,01:00:35.17,V has switched alliances on me.
1804,01:00:35.20,01:00:36.73,If I feel like she is being
1805,01:00:36.77,01:00:38.50,dishonest or if I feel like her
1806,01:00:38.53,01:00:40.37,"integrity is questionable, Neleh"
1807,01:00:40.40,01:00:44.20,may very well get my vote.
1808,01:00:48.97,01:00:50.63,>> There is a huge feeling of
1809,01:00:50.67,01:00:52.07,power being on the jury.
1810,01:00:52.10,01:00:53.90,And I didn't realize that until
1811,01:00:53.93,01:00:55.80,I became one of the jury members
1812,01:00:55.83,01:00:57.67,and had to accept the fact that
1813,01:00:57.70,01:00:59.50,I was out of the game and I was
1814,01:00:59.53,01:01:00.53,now on the jury.
1815,01:01:00.57,01:01:02.30,I don't think I want either of
1816,01:01:02.33,01:01:04.13,the two people that are left to
1817,01:01:04.17,01:01:05.63,have the million dollars.
1818,01:01:05.67,01:01:07.43,So I have a huge decision now.
1819,01:01:07.47,01:01:09.27,"Basically, I have to figure out"
1820,01:01:09.30,01:01:11.17,which one of them I think played
1821,01:01:11.20,01:01:13.00,the game the best and which one
1822,01:01:13.03,01:01:14.63,screwed me over less in the
1823,01:01:14.67,01:01:17.47,game.
1824,01:01:21.43,01:01:24.13,>> I don't know what to do.
1825,01:01:24.17,01:01:25.57,You got these Bible thumpers up
1826,01:01:25.60,01:01:26.87,"there, and you know, just"
1827,01:01:26.90,01:01:28.27,banging either The Book of
1828,01:01:28.30,01:01:29.90, Mormon or banging their Bibles
1829,01:01:29.93,01:01:31.43,and lying out of the sides of
1830,01:01:31.47,01:01:33.10,"their mouths, and now I have to"
1831,01:01:33.13,01:01:34.67,search within myself to figure
1832,01:01:34.70,01:01:36.33,out which one of these creeps I
1833,01:01:36.37,01:01:37.93,want to give a million dollars
1834,01:01:37.97,01:01:38.10,to.
1835,01:01:38.13,01:01:40.17,"I really want to go in and say,"
1836,01:01:40.20,01:01:41.90,"""Okay, the slate is clean."
1837,01:01:41.93,01:01:43.83,Your reaction to my statement
1838,01:01:43.87,01:01:45.77,will determine whether or not
1839,01:01:45.80,01:01:46.83,you get my vote.
1840,01:01:46.87,01:01:48.83,"If you answer honestly, you're"
1841,01:01:48.87,01:01:50.97,"repentant, then I will say okay."
1842,01:01:51.00,01:01:53.10,If you start lying right off the
1843,01:01:53.13,01:01:55.03,bat-- pfft!-- you're going to
1844,01:01:55.07,01:01:55.97,"lose my vote."""
1845,01:01:56.00,01:01:57.97,The power now is shifting back
1846,01:01:58.00,01:01:59.00,to the two of them.
1847,01:01:59.03,01:02:00.77,"And I'm saying, ""Let's see what"
1848,01:02:00.80,01:02:02.83,"you're going to do with it."""
1849,01:02:34.60,01:02:39.47,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inour jury.
1850,01:02:45.67,01:02:47.70,"As you can see, tonight we have"
1851,01:02:47.73,01:02:49.27,"our full jury of seven,"
1852,01:02:49.30,01:02:51.23,including Kathy who was voted
1853,01:02:51.27,01:02:53.17,out at the last Tribal Council.
1854,01:02:53.20,01:02:54.80,"And Paschal is back, who was"
1855,01:02:54.83,01:02:56.83,unable to make the last
1856,01:02:56.87,01:02:57.27,Tribal Council.
1857,01:02:57.30,01:02:59.00,He has been in very good hands
1858,01:02:59.03,01:03:00.77,throughout the night and day.
1859,01:03:00.80,01:03:02.50,He's been fully informed about
1860,01:03:02.53,01:03:04.17,"the last Tribal Council, he's"
1861,01:03:04.20,01:03:05.97,completely up to date and ready
1862,01:03:06.00,01:03:06.63,for tonight.
1863,01:03:06.67,01:03:08.43,"Okay, before we get to the main"
1864,01:03:08.47,01:03:10.10,"event, I want to find out how"
1865,01:03:10.13,01:03:11.80,"you guys spent your last day,"
1866,01:03:11.83,01:03:12.43,the 39th day.
1867,01:03:12.47,01:03:13.93,"Neleh, how was the day for you?"
1868,01:03:13.97,01:03:15.43,>> The day today has just been
1869,01:03:15.47,01:03:15.83,awesome.
1870,01:03:15.87,01:03:17.33,"You know, I slept in as long as"
1871,01:03:17.37,01:03:18.93,"I could, just because I knew the"
1872,01:03:18.97,01:03:20.43,day was going to go by so slow.
1873,01:03:20.47,01:03:21.73,I pretty much just kind of
1874,01:03:21.77,01:03:23.17,rested for about two or three
1875,01:03:23.20,01:03:24.70,"hours, I couldn't really sleep."
1876,01:03:24.73,01:03:26.27,It was more just kind of like in
1877,01:03:26.30,01:03:27.83,"a daze, just, you know, thinking"
1878,01:03:27.87,01:03:29.37,about the last 39 days out here
1879,01:03:29.40,01:03:30.93,and just the people I've met and
1880,01:03:30.97,01:03:32.03,just all the different
1881,01:03:32.07,01:03:33.27,encounters that I've had.
1882,01:03:33.30,01:03:34.77,"And then after that, I just got"
1883,01:03:34.80,01:03:36.30,this really big spurt of energy
1884,01:03:36.33,01:03:37.77,just out of nowhere and I just
1885,01:03:37.80,01:03:39.30,got up and just started burning
1886,01:03:39.33,01:03:39.87,everything.
1887,01:03:39.90,01:03:40.83,>> Burning everything.
1888,01:03:40.87,01:03:42.13,>> I pretty much just went to
1889,01:03:42.17,01:03:42.67,town.
1890,01:03:42.70,01:03:43.87,"I was a pyro today, you know,"
1891,01:03:43.90,01:03:45.03,putting soot and stuff on my
1892,01:03:45.07,01:03:46.27,"face, just burning everything"
1893,01:03:46.30,01:03:47.53,"that I could, so it was a nice"
1894,01:03:47.57,01:03:48.00,day.
1895,01:03:48.03,01:03:49.80,">> PROBST: Okay, you two have"
1896,01:03:49.83,01:03:51.27,come as far as you can.
1897,01:03:51.30,01:03:52.97,The focus now shifts to the
1898,01:03:53.00,01:03:54.60,seven members of the jury.
1899,01:03:54.63,01:03:56.37,It is one of the most unique
1900,01:03:56.40,01:03:57.67,aspects of this game.
1901,01:03:57.70,01:03:59.70,Seven people that you had a hand
1902,01:03:59.73,01:04:01.73,in voting out now get to decide
1903,01:04:01.77,01:04:02.73,your fate.
1904,01:04:02.77,01:04:04.60,You start this game with a clean
1905,01:04:04.63,01:04:06.17,"slate and over 39 days, you"
1906,01:04:06.20,01:04:07.10,build a history.
1907,01:04:07.13,01:04:08.97,Tonight that history is going to
1908,01:04:09.00,01:04:10.57,be evaluated and ultimately
1909,01:04:10.60,01:04:11.17,judged.
1910,01:04:11.20,01:04:12.90,"Your behavior, good or bad, as"
1911,01:04:12.93,01:04:14.43,well as how you respond to
1912,01:04:14.47,01:04:16.20,"tonight's Tribal Council, will"
1913,01:04:16.23,01:04:17.97,have a big impact on the final
1914,01:04:18.00,01:04:18.20,vote.
1915,01:04:18.23,01:04:19.50,Here's how it will work.
1916,01:04:19.53,01:04:20.90,We'll begin with an opening
1917,01:04:20.93,01:04:22.40,statement by each of you-- a
1918,01:04:22.43,01:04:24.10,chance to address the jury and
1919,01:04:24.13,01:04:25.80,explain why you think you're the
1920,01:04:25.83,01:04:27.27,most deserving person of the
1921,01:04:27.30,01:04:28.77,title Survivor and a million
1922,01:04:28.80,01:04:30.13,dollars.
1923,01:04:30.17,01:04:32.60,Then the jury gets a chance to
1924,01:04:32.63,01:04:33.93,address you.
1925,01:04:33.97,01:04:35.20,"They can make a comment, they"
1926,01:04:35.23,01:04:36.03,can ask a question.
1927,01:04:36.07,01:04:37.47,You'll then get a chance to make
1928,01:04:37.50,01:04:38.77,a closing statement addressing
1929,01:04:38.80,01:04:40.03,some of the things that have
1930,01:04:40.07,01:04:40.47,come up.
1931,01:04:40.50,01:04:41.80,Then we go to the vote.
1932,01:04:41.83,01:04:43.17,How you respond to these
1933,01:04:43.20,01:04:44.77,questions is very important.
1934,01:04:44.80,01:04:45.87,It's time to begin.

1937,01:04:48.30,01:04:49.80,">> Okay. Well, what I just want"
1938,01:04:49.83,01:04:51.30,to say to you guys is I've had
1939,01:04:51.33,01:04:52.70,the most incredible time out
1940,01:04:52.73,01:04:52.93,here.
1941,01:04:52.97,01:04:54.47,"You know, the last 39 days, I"
1942,01:04:54.50,01:04:55.97,honestly when I first came to
1943,01:04:56.00,01:04:57.60,"this island, I was like, oh, my"
1944,01:04:57.63,01:04:59.17,"heck, I don't have a chance to"
1945,01:04:59.20,01:05:00.27,be in the final end.
1946,01:05:00.30,01:05:01.63,"I mean, just that I was up"
1947,01:05:01.67,01:05:03.10,against such competitors and
1948,01:05:03.13,01:05:04.43,such strong-willed people.
1949,01:05:04.47,01:05:05.80,And there were times where
1950,01:05:05.83,01:05:07.27,literally you guys were just
1951,01:05:07.30,01:05:08.77,pulling me through the entire
1952,01:05:08.80,01:05:09.03,time.
1953,01:05:09.07,01:05:10.53,I wasn't the strongest person
1954,01:05:10.57,01:05:12.17,"but spiritually and mentally, I"
1955,01:05:12.20,01:05:13.83,"just tried to provide, you know,"
1956,01:05:13.87,01:05:15.33,"upliftment and you know, just"
1957,01:05:15.37,01:05:16.87,everything that I did for you
1958,01:05:16.90,01:05:18.47,"guys, I want you to know that I"
1959,01:05:18.50,01:05:20.17,did sincerely out of the love of
1960,01:05:20.20,01:05:20.60,my heart.
1961,01:05:20.63,01:05:22.13,"Just overall, I seriously want"
1962,01:05:22.17,01:05:23.63,you to know that I have given
1963,01:05:23.67,01:05:25.23,"everything 100% out here, and I"
1964,01:05:25.27,01:05:26.13,just love you guys
1965,01:05:26.17,01:05:27.73,"unconditionally, no matter what"
1966,01:05:27.77,01:05:28.80,your vote is tonight.
1967,01:05:28.83,01:05:29.97,I want you to know that
1968,01:05:30.00,01:05:31.63,"sincerely, from the bottom of my"
1969,01:05:31.67,01:05:35.07,heart.
1970,01:05:35.10,01:05:36.83,">> PROBST: V, why do you deserve"
1971,01:05:36.87,01:05:38.10,to win this?
1972,01:05:38.13,01:05:39.80,">> Well, guys, this has been a"
1973,01:05:39.83,01:05:41.23,wonderful ride for me.
1974,01:05:41.27,01:05:42.73,The vision was brought to me
1975,01:05:42.77,01:05:44.17,about four months ago.
1976,01:05:44.20,01:05:45.93,And just like the Scripture
1977,01:05:45.97,01:05:47.77,"says, that I write my vision"
1978,01:05:47.80,01:05:49.57,down and I make it plain on
1979,01:05:49.60,01:05:51.27,tablets and that I kept it
1980,01:05:51.30,01:05:53.17,before me each and every day.
1981,01:05:53.20,01:05:55.20,"From the day I came out here, I"
1982,01:05:55.23,01:05:57.33,made several things clear that I
1983,01:05:57.37,01:05:58.07,wanted to do.
1984,01:05:58.10,01:05:59.67,"The first thing, I wanted to"
1985,01:05:59.70,01:06:01.53,"have a strategy, and I saw that"
1986,01:06:01.57,01:06:03.10,strategy all the way to its
1987,01:06:03.13,01:06:03.73,completion.
1988,01:06:03.77,01:06:05.53,The second thing was I promised
1989,01:06:05.57,01:06:07.07,myself that I would develop
1990,01:06:07.10,01:06:08.87,relationships with every single
1991,01:06:08.90,01:06:10.50,"person, and I value each and"
1992,01:06:10.53,01:06:11.43,every one of you.
1993,01:06:11.47,01:06:12.97,And the third thing was that
1994,01:06:13.00,01:06:14.57,"when I came in here, I didn't"
1995,01:06:14.60,01:06:16.17,want to come in here and ride
1996,01:06:16.20,01:06:17.47,anybody's coattail.
1997,01:06:17.50,01:06:19.70,I wanted to prove myself with my
1998,01:06:19.73,01:06:21.07,"work ethics, with my"
1999,01:06:21.10,01:06:23.23,"spirituality, and with my... my"
2000,01:06:23.27,01:06:25.27,gumption to come out here and
2001,01:06:25.30,01:06:26.83,be the ultimate survivor.
2002,01:06:26.87,01:06:28.20,And I feel that I
2003,01:06:28.23,01:06:30.17,contributed wholeheartedly 100%
2004,01:06:30.20,01:06:32.03,"to everything I did, even when"
2005,01:06:32.07,01:06:33.73,people called me deceiving.
2006,01:06:33.77,01:06:35.63,I still were friends to all of
2007,01:06:35.67,01:06:37.13,"you, and I hope that you"
2008,01:06:37.17,01:06:38.03,remember that.
2009,01:06:38.07,01:06:39.60,But I put my faith in God
2010,01:06:39.63,01:06:41.47,knowing that you guys will all
2011,01:06:41.50,01:06:43.07,look at this objectively.
2012,01:06:43.10,01:06:44.17,"That's, that's all."
2013,01:06:44.20,01:06:45.87,And that's all I have to say.
2014,01:06:45.90,01:06:47.60,"And, um... God bless you all."
2015,01:06:47.63,01:06:48.90,">> PROBST: Okay, jury."
2016,01:06:48.93,01:06:50.53,I want you guys to take some
2017,01:06:50.57,01:06:52.33,time to think about what Neleh
2018,01:06:52.37,01:06:53.83,"and V just said, because in a"
2019,01:06:53.87,01:06:55.30,"moment, you are going to ask"
2020,01:06:55.33,01:06:56.77,each of them a question that
2021,01:06:56.80,01:06:58.47,will help you decide who will be
2022,01:06:58.50,01:07:01.90,the sole Survivor.

2027,01:07:26.23,01:07:27.60,This is a chance-- one last
2028,01:07:27.63,01:07:29.23,chance-- to elicit a little more

2030,01:07:30.93,01:07:32.40,the person who will win a
2031,01:07:32.43,01:07:34.07,million dollars and the title of
2032,01:07:34.10,01:07:35.07,sole Survivor.
2033,01:07:35.10,01:07:37.37,You can ask a question or make a
2034,01:07:37.40,01:07:38.10,statement.
2035,01:07:38.13,01:07:41.10,We'll begin with Tammy.
2036,01:07:43.63,01:07:45.27,>> I have always been up-front
2037,01:07:45.30,01:07:46.97,about the way that I was going
2038,01:07:47.00,01:07:47.97,to play this game.
2039,01:07:48.00,01:07:49.73,Said all along that I was going
2040,01:07:49.77,01:07:51.37,"to lie, I was going to cheat."
2041,01:07:51.40,01:07:53.00,I was going to do whatever it
2042,01:07:53.03,01:07:54.23,took to win this game.
2043,01:07:54.27,01:07:55.87,"But sometime during the game,"
2044,01:07:55.90,01:07:57.00,my strategy changed.
2045,01:07:57.03,01:07:58.73,I started feeling bad about the
2046,01:07:58.77,01:08:00.50,way I was playing the game and
2047,01:08:00.53,01:08:02.13,it was because of you two and
2048,01:08:02.17,01:08:03.87,"your holier than thou attitude,"
2049,01:08:03.90,01:08:05.57,"and ""I'm not going to lie, I'm"
2050,01:08:05.60,01:08:07.27,"not going to cheat, let's take"
2051,01:08:07.30,01:08:09.00,"this game to a new level, let's"
2052,01:08:09.03,01:08:10.77,"play it with ethics, and morals"
2053,01:08:10.80,01:08:11.60,"and integrity."""
2054,01:08:11.63,01:08:13.30,"Well, you guys are hypocrites,"
2055,01:08:13.33,01:08:14.67,as far as I'm concerned.
2056,01:08:14.70,01:08:16.30,And you may have been the two
2057,01:08:16.33,01:08:18.13,biggest liars out on the island.
2058,01:08:18.17,01:08:19.87,While you're condemning Rob and
2059,01:08:19.90,01:08:21.40,John and Zoe and myself for
2060,01:08:21.43,01:08:22.67,manipulating and being
2061,01:08:22.70,01:08:24.37,"deceptive, you guys were doing"
2062,01:08:24.40,01:08:26.10,the exact same thing behind our
2063,01:08:26.13,01:08:27.77,"backs, but under the guise of"
2064,01:08:27.80,01:08:29.30,"Christianity and ""we're not"
2065,01:08:29.33,01:08:30.30,"going to lie."""
2066,01:08:30.33,01:08:31.60,"V, you flip-flopped so many"
2067,01:08:31.63,01:08:33.13,"times in this game, I don't even"
2068,01:08:33.17,01:08:34.57,think you knew which team you
2069,01:08:34.60,01:08:36.00,were playing on half the time.
2070,01:08:36.03,01:08:37.37,But you always made yourself
2071,01:08:37.40,01:08:38.83,"feel better, because after you"
2072,01:08:38.87,01:08:40.17,"lied to somebody, you always"
2073,01:08:40.20,01:08:41.20,went up and asked for their
2074,01:08:41.23,01:08:41.77,forgiveness.
2075,01:08:41.80,01:08:43.00,And then you asked God to
2076,01:08:43.03,01:08:44.07,forgive you for lying.
2077,01:08:44.10,01:08:45.60,"Neleh, you started this game out"
2078,01:08:45.63,01:08:47.03,as a 21-year-old Mormon woman
2079,01:08:47.07,01:08:48.33,who seemed to have a lot of
2080,01:08:48.37,01:08:48.97,self-respect.
2081,01:08:49.00,01:08:50.47,The one thing that you said you
2082,01:08:50.50,01:08:52.03,wanted from the beginning was to
2083,01:08:52.07,01:08:53.23,make it to the jury.
2084,01:08:53.27,01:08:54.93,"So Rob, John, Zoe and myself"
2085,01:08:54.97,01:08:56.80,offered you a chance to make it
2086,01:08:56.83,01:08:57.50,to the jury.
2087,01:08:57.53,01:08:59.40,"That sounded good to you, until"
2088,01:08:59.43,01:09:01.33,you got greedy and decided that
2089,01:09:01.37,01:09:03.10,being on the jury wasn't good
2090,01:09:03.13,01:09:03.93,enough.
2091,01:09:03.97,01:09:06.03,"So you lied to us, you stabbed"
2092,01:09:06.07,01:09:08.23,us in the back and you voted us
2093,01:09:08.27,01:09:10.17,off.
2094,01:09:10.20,01:09:11.80,This is the thing.
2095,01:09:11.83,01:09:13.37,I don't think either one of you
2096,01:09:13.40,01:09:14.80,deserve the million dollars.
2097,01:09:14.83,01:09:16.47,I think the person that deserves
2098,01:09:16.50,01:09:18.10,the million dollars is the woman
2099,01:09:18.13,01:09:19.57,"that you voted out yesterday,"
2100,01:09:19.60,01:09:21.13,right after you stabbed her in
2101,01:09:21.17,01:09:23.23,"the back, V."
2102,01:09:23.27,01:09:26.83,"But this is a game, and you guys"
2103,01:09:26.87,01:09:28.27,beat me at my own game.
2104,01:09:28.30,01:09:29.67,You lied better than I did.
2105,01:09:29.70,01:09:30.90,You manipulated better than I
2106,01:09:30.93,01:09:32.23,"did, and you deceived everybody"
2107,01:09:32.27,01:09:33.33,better than I did.
2108,01:09:33.37,01:09:36.10,So congratulations.

2124,01:10:02.77,01:10:03.93,say you're contradictory.
2125,01:10:03.97,01:10:05.47,'Cause people do it all the time

2130,01:10:10.67,01:10:12.00,"guys, I want you to directly"
2131,01:10:12.03,01:10:13.73,answer my question.
2132,01:10:13.77,01:10:16.50,Is there... some kind of moral
2133,01:10:16.53,01:10:18.93,message that you feel like
2134,01:10:18.97,01:10:21.20,you've gained from this game?
2135,01:10:21.23,01:10:23.97,">> Morally, there were times in"
2136,01:10:24.00,01:10:25.83,the game where I wanted to
2137,01:10:25.87,01:10:27.43,"follow my heart, but because of"
2138,01:10:27.47,01:10:28.93,the strong alliance that I had
2139,01:10:28.97,01:10:30.40,"made, I felt like I couldn't do"
2140,01:10:30.43,01:10:31.83,"that, and that is one thing"
2141,01:10:31.87,01:10:33.60,"morally that I've learned, is to"
2142,01:10:33.63,01:10:35.33,follow my heart from now on.
2143,01:10:35.37,01:10:36.40,>> PROBST: V.
2144,01:10:36.43,01:10:37.83,>> And I would fall in line with
2145,01:10:37.87,01:10:39.17,the same thing.
2146,01:10:39.20,01:10:42.73,The lesson is that when I'm in a
2147,01:10:42.77,01:10:44.67,"situation, I will really think"
2148,01:10:44.70,01:10:46.13,it through before I give my word
2149,01:10:46.17,01:10:47.27,on something.
2150,01:10:47.30,01:10:49.80,Because sometimes I acted very
2151,01:10:49.83,01:10:52.43,quickly on making decisions and
2152,01:10:52.47,01:10:54.13,I would just give somebody the
2153,01:10:54.17,01:10:55.77,answer just to appease them.
2154,01:10:55.80,01:10:57.53,"So now, instead of just quickly"
2155,01:10:57.57,01:10:59.20,"giving people answers, I will"
2156,01:10:59.23,01:11:01.10,take the time to really think it
2157,01:11:01.13,01:11:02.93,"through and tell them, you know,"
2158,01:11:02.97,01:11:04.80,"either, ""I'll get back with you"""
2159,01:11:04.83,01:11:06.57,so that I know I'm not battling
2160,01:11:06.60,01:11:08.20,with my morals as opposed to
2161,01:11:08.23,01:11:09.63,giving somebody my word.
2162,01:11:09.67,01:11:10.90,>> That's it.

2167,01:11:21.20,01:11:23.20,I was more concerned about being
2168,01:11:23.23,01:11:24.20,here.
2169,01:11:24.23,01:11:25.73,"Uh, both of you ladies are"

2173,01:11:30.53,01:11:32.20,You are both the epitome of what
2174,01:11:32.23,01:11:34.07,this great country of ours has
2175,01:11:34.10,01:11:35.23,to offer.
2176,01:11:35.27,01:11:37.30,I am so proud of both of you.
2177,01:11:37.33,01:11:39.57,I would love to have had either
2178,01:11:39.60,01:11:41.50,one of you as my daughters.
2179,01:11:41.53,01:11:43.03,You're those types of
2180,01:11:43.07,01:11:44.40,individuals.
2181,01:11:44.43,01:11:46.03,"And through it all, you have"
2182,01:11:46.07,01:11:47.87,given me the strength to get to
2183,01:11:47.90,01:11:49.60,"the point that I got through,"
2184,01:11:49.63,01:11:51.43,"and realize that, from this day"
2185,01:11:51.47,01:11:52.97,"forward, I'm going to be a"
2186,01:11:53.00,01:11:54.63,better person for having met

2208,01:12:31.27,01:12:33.03,I always believed that you
2209,01:12:33.07,01:12:35.27,should never regret any decision
2210,01:12:35.30,01:12:37.50,you make or any action you take.
2211,01:12:37.53,01:12:39.50,But during the course of this

2219,01:12:52.63,01:12:53.47,did in this game.
2220,01:12:53.50,01:12:54.93,>> I'm looking for specifics.
2221,01:12:54.97,01:12:56.23,Just one specific thing.

2229,01:13:09.83,01:13:13.30,"us four, rather than me and Sean"
2230,01:13:13.33,01:13:13.90,in the end.
2231,01:13:13.93,01:13:15.27,But because of the alliance that
2232,01:13:15.30,01:13:16.60,"I made with the five of them, I"
2233,01:13:16.63,01:13:17.90,felt like I needed to stick to

2245,01:13:32.80,01:13:33.67,And I feel like I should be
2246,01:13:33.70,01:13:34.67,sitting up there in that seat.
2247,01:13:34.70,01:13:35.73,I feel I worked really hard out
2248,01:13:35.77,01:13:36.70,there.
2249,01:13:36.73,01:13:38.93,I played hard with the people
2250,01:13:38.97,01:13:41.30,"who wanted to play, but I'm not"
2251,01:13:41.33,01:13:43.47,going to talk about lies and

2255,01:13:48.83,01:13:50.70,"Basically, I believe both of you"
2256,01:13:50.73,01:13:52.50,"have good hearts, and you made"

2264,01:14:15.40,01:14:18.33,"questions, and first question is"
2265,01:14:18.37,01:14:19.00,for Neleh.
2266,01:14:19.03,01:14:20.87,"I was just curious, at what"
2267,01:14:20.90,01:14:22.90,point in the game do you feel
2268,01:14:22.93,01:14:25.03,that you did your most dramatic
2269,01:14:25.07,01:14:27.23,"strategic movement, and what the"
2270,01:14:27.27,01:14:29.27,decision was and when and the
2271,01:14:29.30,01:14:31.00,decision that you made by
2272,01:14:31.03,01:14:32.70,yourself.
2273,01:14:32.73,01:14:34.67,>> The time in the game where
2274,01:14:34.70,01:14:36.73,actually I started playing the
2275,01:14:36.77,01:14:37.87,game was day 24.
2276,01:14:37.90,01:14:39.10,"You know, Paschal and I"
2277,01:14:39.13,01:14:40.87,both talked about this together.
2278,01:14:40.90,01:14:42.30,It was one of those things
2279,01:14:42.33,01:14:43.67,"where, you know, Sean had"
2280,01:14:43.70,01:14:45.43,approached us earlier saying the
2281,01:14:45.47,01:14:47.17,"four of them are in an alliance,"
2282,01:14:47.20,01:14:48.73,"you know, we can switch this"
2283,01:14:48.77,01:14:50.13,game around at this point.
2284,01:14:50.17,01:14:51.73,"Up until that time, I mean, I"
2285,01:14:51.77,01:14:53.33,was seriously 100% going with
2286,01:14:53.37,01:14:55.10,Rotu and just hoping that in the
2287,01:14:55.13,01:14:56.83,"end, out of the six of us, maybe"
2288,01:14:56.87,01:14:58.60,"something would change, because,"
2289,01:14:58.63,01:15:00.37,"you know, there was the four of"
2290,01:15:00.40,01:15:01.63,them and the two of us.
2291,01:15:01.67,01:15:03.10,But when it got down to the
2292,01:15:03.13,01:15:04.80,"nitty gritty, that is when, you"
2293,01:15:04.83,01:15:06.20,"know, we made the biggest"
2294,01:15:06.23,01:15:07.00,strategic move.
2295,01:15:07.03,01:15:08.50,And that was the five of us
2296,01:15:08.53,01:15:09.87,against the four of them.
2297,01:15:09.90,01:15:11.63,"And that, it's... you know, I've"
2298,01:15:11.67,01:15:13.13,been saying that all along.
2299,01:15:13.17,01:15:14.70,That's when I started playing
2300,01:15:14.73,01:15:15.83,the game was day 24.
2301,01:15:15.87,01:15:17.83,">> And then V, um, one time you"
2302,01:15:17.87,01:15:19.70,did tell me your strategy and
2303,01:15:19.73,01:15:21.63,the strategy was that you were
2304,01:15:21.67,01:15:23.57,going to wait to be approached
2305,01:15:23.60,01:15:25.13,"by people for alliances,"
2306,01:15:25.17,01:15:27.00,"strategy, that you were never"
2307,01:15:27.03,01:15:29.03,going to set forth and do it on
2308,01:15:29.07,01:15:29.57,your own.
2309,01:15:29.60,01:15:31.40,"The question is, how can you go"
2310,01:15:31.43,01:15:33.00,"through the game, you know,"
2311,01:15:33.03,01:15:34.43,adjusting with all these
2312,01:15:34.47,01:15:36.23,alliances and not feel part of
2313,01:15:36.27,01:15:37.50,the devious behavior?
2314,01:15:37.53,01:15:38.63,That was my question.
2315,01:15:38.67,01:15:40.37,">> My strategy, yes, was for me"
2316,01:15:40.40,01:15:42.10,to wait for people to approach
2317,01:15:42.13,01:15:43.43,me.
2318,01:15:43.47,01:15:45.37,Now if I felt that there was a
2319,01:15:45.40,01:15:47.43,strategic move being worked that
2320,01:15:47.47,01:15:49.47,"I can weasel my way in there, I"
2321,01:15:49.50,01:15:51.37,would take the initiative and
2322,01:15:51.40,01:15:52.33,ask.
2323,01:15:52.37,01:15:54.67,Everyone is constantly changing
2324,01:15:54.70,01:15:57.03,"their game plan, and you're out"
2325,01:15:57.07,01:15:58.87,"here to outwit, outplay,"
2326,01:15:58.90,01:15:59.23,outlast.
2327,01:15:59.27,01:16:00.60,"Outwit may be, immediately I"
2328,01:16:00.63,01:16:01.63,need to make a change.
2329,01:16:01.67,01:16:03.57,"So, that's what it was."
2330,01:16:03.60,01:16:04.80,It's like when you wanted to
2331,01:16:04.83,01:16:06.13,line up with me and said don't
2332,01:16:06.17,01:16:07.33,"oust me, you weren't even a"
2333,01:16:07.37,01:16:08.70,person I was going to even get
2334,01:16:08.73,01:16:09.00,rid of.
2335,01:16:09.03,01:16:09.90,I had Neleh in mind.
2336,01:16:09.93,01:16:10.87,>> That's okay. You...
2337,01:16:10.90,01:16:12.13,">> So, I mean, you know, you"

2344,01:16:17.97,01:16:19.17,Did I answer your question?
2345,01:16:19.20,01:16:20.90,">> No, but that's okay."

2351,01:16:35.43,01:16:36.80,>> You know how I feel.
2352,01:16:36.83,01:16:38.77,I threw out the honesty card.

2354,01:16:41.00,01:16:42.10,It's important to me.
2355,01:16:42.13,01:16:43.63,Integrity is important to me.
2356,01:16:43.67,01:16:45.63,"You both lied, okay?"
2357,01:16:45.67,01:16:47.67,"Cut to the chase, you're not"
2358,01:16:47.70,01:16:49.67,"innocent, you're not naive."
2359,01:16:49.70,01:16:52.00,"You both did it, so take a deep"
2360,01:16:52.03,01:16:53.50,breath and clear it.
2361,01:16:53.53,01:16:54.93,Everybody knows it.
2362,01:16:54.97,01:16:57.07,"So I want to know now, right"
2363,01:16:57.10,01:16:59.43,"now, why the hell should I give"
2364,01:16:59.47,01:17:01.30,you my vote?
2365,01:17:01.33,01:17:03.13,"Plain and simple, and knowing"

2368,01:17:06.47,01:17:07.97,"days, you know who I am."
2369,01:17:08.00,01:17:09.90,Why should I give you my vote?

2373,01:17:14.30,01:17:15.83,"Goll, that... sucks."
2374,01:17:15.87,01:17:18.27,Um... the reason why you should
2375,01:17:18.30,01:17:20.37,"give me your vote, John, is"
2376,01:17:20.40,01:17:22.73,"because truly, honestly, I was"
2377,01:17:22.77,01:17:24.63,going to join your guys'
2378,01:17:24.67,01:17:26.77,"foursome alliance, honestly"
2379,01:17:26.80,01:17:29.27,hoping that in the end something
2380,01:17:29.30,01:17:31.70,would change around and I would
2381,01:17:31.73,01:17:34.00,be able to be more than fifth
2382,01:17:34.03,01:17:34.93,place.
2383,01:17:34.97,01:17:37.13,As soon as I found out that was
2384,01:17:37.17,01:17:39.17,"not going to happen, that is"
2385,01:17:39.20,01:17:41.27,when I decided to not do that
2386,01:17:41.30,01:17:43.43,"anymore, and that's my answer."
2387,01:17:43.47,01:17:45.77,Is that what you're looking for?
2388,01:17:45.80,01:17:46.97,>> Yeah.
2389,01:17:47.00,01:17:48.30,>> PROBST: Vecepia?
2390,01:17:48.33,01:17:50.00,>> The reason why I think that
2391,01:17:50.03,01:17:51.73,you should give me the million

2394,01:17:54.83,01:17:55.30,strategy.
2395,01:17:55.33,01:17:57.10,"Number two, coming in here with"
2396,01:17:57.13,01:17:58.93,"a strategy, playing the game all"
2397,01:17:58.97,01:18:00.83,the way to the hilt-- whether it
2398,01:18:00.87,01:18:02.70,deceived you or deceived anybody
2399,01:18:02.73,01:18:04.47,else-- I played the game to the
2400,01:18:04.50,01:18:06.33,fullest to get me to where I am.
2401,01:18:06.37,01:18:08.00,Did I answer your question?
2402,01:18:08.03,01:18:08.80,">> Yes, you did."

2405,01:18:14.50,01:18:16.47,of questions and talk about
2406,01:18:16.50,01:18:18.67,worthiness and justifying your
2407,01:18:18.70,01:18:20.80,behavior while condemning the
2408,01:18:20.83,01:18:22.27,same behavior in others.
2409,01:18:22.30,01:18:24.20,You'll have a chance to address

2426,01:19:17.13,01:19:18.83,I felt that some people just
2427,01:19:18.87,01:19:20.70,"made comments, and I wanted to"
2428,01:19:20.73,01:19:22.60,have questions so that you guys
2429,01:19:22.63,01:19:24.40,will have a strong base to go

2434,01:19:30.77,01:19:32.70,But just make sure that whatever
2435,01:19:32.73,01:19:34.43,responses the two of us gave

2450,01:19:53.90,01:19:55.60,everybody here would deserve a

2452,01:19:56.57,01:19:58.23,I think it's luck that I'm up

2457,01:20:04.03,01:20:05.77,I didn't feel like I needed to

2459,01:20:06.93,01:20:08.73,And so everything that happened

2467,01:20:21.43,01:20:22.43,different.

2469,01:20:23.73,01:20:25.40,somebody out of the tribe.

2497,01:22:50.10,01:22:51.53,"better you than me, sweetie."
2498,01:22:51.57,01:22:52.63,You deserve this.

2502,01:22:56.50,01:22:59.47,But if you do happen to win one

2549,01:29:46.57,01:29:47.90,than right here in Central Park
2550,01:29:47.93,01:29:48.93,in New York City.
2551,01:29:48.97,01:29:50.37,I have the votes.
2552,01:29:50.40,01:29:52.90,We're going to get to them.
2553,01:29:52.93,01:29:55.30,"But first, it's been five months"
2554,01:29:55.33,01:29:57.03,since we finished this.
2555,01:29:57.07,01:29:59.23,Five months since these votes
2556,01:29:59.27,01:30:00.37,were cast.
2557,01:30:00.40,01:30:01.60,Nothing you two are going to say
2558,01:30:01.63,01:30:02.83,tonight is going to change these
2559,01:30:02.87,01:30:03.87,votes.
2560,01:30:03.90,01:30:05.43,Outcome already determined.
2561,01:30:05.47,01:30:06.73,Just not yet revealed.
2562,01:30:06.77,01:30:08.40,"So with that in mind, as you"
2563,01:30:08.43,01:30:10.23,guys watched this play out over
2564,01:30:10.27,01:30:12.10,"the last 13 weeks on television,"
2565,01:30:12.13,01:30:13.93,I'm imagining a lot of what you
2566,01:30:13.97,01:30:15.60,heard or said was said about
2567,01:30:15.63,01:30:17.20,"you, you're hearing for the"
2568,01:30:17.23,01:30:18.97,first time because you are not
2569,01:30:19.00,01:30:20.73,always privy to the interviews
2570,01:30:20.77,01:30:22.63,or what happens behind your back
2571,01:30:22.67,01:30:24.60,or at the other camp.
2572,01:30:24.60,01:30:27.13,"So my question, Vecepia, I'llstart with you, is did you hear"
2573,01:30:27.13,01:30:27.73,
2574,01:30:27.77,01:30:29.40,anything when you watched it at
2575,01:30:29.43,01:30:30.97,"home when you said ""Wow, that"
2576,01:30:31.00,01:30:32.57,surprises me that people would
2577,01:30:32.60,01:30:34.23,say that about me or think that
2578,01:30:34.27,01:30:34.80,"about me""?"
2579,01:30:34.83,01:30:36.37,">> I was surprised about, one of"
2580,01:30:36.40,01:30:37.40,the biggest things is
2581,01:30:37.43,01:30:38.10,perception.
2582,01:30:38.13,01:30:39.60,Perception regarding myself and
2583,01:30:39.63,01:30:41.17,"Sean, how people thought that an"
2584,01:30:41.20,01:30:42.67,alliance was the same as having
2585,01:30:42.70,01:30:43.90,a relationship or a bond.
2586,01:30:43.93,01:30:45.37,Now we're going to have bonds.
2587,01:30:45.40,01:30:46.90,We're going to have a Christian
2588,01:30:46.93,01:30:48.30,"bond, we're gonna have a bond"
2589,01:30:48.33,01:30:49.67,"that we're African-American,"
2590,01:30:49.70,01:30:51.23,that we came from the same tribe
2591,01:30:51.27,01:30:52.77,originally and went all the way
2592,01:30:52.80,01:30:54.07,together and then also just
2593,01:30:54.10,01:30:55.40,because we have some social
2594,01:30:55.43,01:30:56.97,identities that we can relate to
2595,01:30:57.00,01:30:58.53,"like the fact that, you know, we"
2596,01:30:58.57,01:30:59.93,know the brothers and sisters
2597,01:30:59.97,01:31:01.50,is chillin' at the barber shop
2598,01:31:01.53,01:31:03.43,and they're talking about us.
2599,01:31:03.43,01:31:05.83,That is an honorable thing.But a lot of people thought that
2600,01:31:05.83,01:31:06.27,
2601,01:31:06.30,01:31:07.27,that was an alliance.
2602,01:31:07.30,01:31:08.63,So people felt that we had an
2603,01:31:08.67,01:31:10.10,alliance and it was the same as
2604,01:31:10.13,01:31:11.17,"a bond, and it wasn't."
2605,01:31:11.20,01:31:12.47,So it really surprised me to
2606,01:31:12.50,01:31:13.90,hear some of the things people
2607,01:31:13.93,01:31:14.83,said regarding that.
2608,01:31:14.87,01:31:16.37,">> PROBST: How about you, Neleh,"
2609,01:31:16.40,01:31:17.63,did you hear anything about
2610,01:31:17.67,01:31:18.97,"yourself and thought, ""Never"
2611,01:31:19.00,01:31:20.40,knew people thought that about
2612,01:31:20.43,01:31:20.93,"me""?"
2613,01:31:20.97,01:31:22.20,">> Well, I thought it was kind"
2614,01:31:22.23,01:31:23.67,"of funny-- you know, I came out"
2615,01:31:23.70,01:31:25.20,"here, you know, we all basically"
2616,01:31:25.23,01:31:26.60,"came out here, obviously-- to"
2617,01:31:26.63,01:31:27.90,play the game for a million
2618,01:31:27.93,01:31:28.30,dollars.
2619,01:31:28.33,01:31:29.67,I didn't have to really start
2620,01:31:29.70,01:31:31.10,getting in and digging my feet
2621,01:31:31.13,01:31:32.37,"in until day 24, because I"
2622,01:31:32.40,01:31:33.47,wasn't really a target.
2623,01:31:33.50,01:31:35.00,"You know, I came out there right"
2624,01:31:35.03,01:31:36.43,"away, you know, me and Paschal"
2625,01:31:36.47,01:31:37.97,"were kind of like, you know, oh,"
2626,01:31:38.00,01:31:39.33,they can't carry us as much.
2627,01:31:39.37,01:31:40.87,We were kind of treated a little
2628,01:31:40.90,01:31:41.47,bit that way.
2629,01:31:41.50,01:31:42.87,So it was... It was different
2630,01:31:42.90,01:31:44.30,"for me, I guess, to see people"
2631,01:31:44.33,01:31:45.60,kind of put me in like this
2632,01:31:45.63,01:31:47.00,sweetheart role and then also
2633,01:31:47.03,01:31:48.50,put me in this competitive
2634,01:31:48.53,01:31:48.93,role.
2635,01:31:48.97,01:31:50.67,And people couldn't like put the
2636,01:31:50.70,01:31:51.40,two together.
2637,01:31:51.43,01:31:53.00,"They're like, she's either"
2638,01:31:53.03,01:31:54.57,sweet or she's competitive.
2639,01:31:54.60,01:31:56.33,If she's sweet... or if she's
2640,01:31:56.37,01:31:57.97,"really competitive, then the"
2641,01:31:58.00,01:31:59.67,sweetness must be a cover-up.
2642,01:31:59.70,01:32:01.47,"So, that was pretty different"
2643,01:32:01.50,01:32:02.63,for me.
2644,01:32:02.67,01:32:04.17,">> PROBST: Well, there's no"
2645,01:32:04.20,01:32:05.87,"arguing, I think Sean said it,"
2646,01:32:05.90,01:32:07.60,you two played better than the
2647,01:32:07.63,01:32:09.23,"other 14, no matter what they"
2648,01:32:09.27,01:32:10.83,may try to tell you later or
2649,01:32:10.87,01:32:11.77,argue otherwise.
2650,01:32:11.80,01:32:12.90,You're sitting here.
2651,01:32:12.93,01:32:13.63,They aren't.
2652,01:32:13.67,01:32:15.33,"We're gonna find out now, of the"
2653,01:32:15.37,01:32:17.07,"two of you, who played the best."
2654,01:32:17.10,01:32:18.37,I want to poll the jury.
2655,01:32:18.40,01:32:20.00,Has anybody talked about their
2656,01:32:20.03,01:32:22.13,vote with anybody else?
2657,01:32:22.17,01:32:23.23,Cool.
