75,00:01:51.27,00:01:51.27,They competed against one

81,00:02:00.30,00:02:00.30,"Rotu, immunity!"
82,00:02:01.67,00:02:01.67,...and again.
83,00:02:02.60,00:02:02.60,Rotu!
84,00:02:03.07,00:02:03.07,(cheering)
85,00:02:04.10,00:02:04.10,Maraamu was forced to vote out
86,00:02:05.93,00:02:05.93,three members in a row.
87,00:02:07.60,00:02:07.60,"Hunter, one of the tribe's"

95,00:02:20.23,00:02:20.23,Rob became Maraamu's self-

97,00:02:22.50,00:02:22.50,>> Fear keeps people loyal.
98,00:02:23.93,00:02:23.93,That's straight out of The

100,00:02:26.47,00:02:26.47,>> PROBST: But a reshuffling of
101,00:02:28.07,00:02:28.07,the tribes sent the survivors
102,00:02:29.60,00:02:29.60,scrambling for new strategies.
103,00:02:31.17,00:02:31.17,"Pick a disk, it doesn't matter,"

105,00:02:34.47,00:02:34.47,Swap out.
106,00:02:35.67,00:02:35.67,You're now a member of Rotu.
107,00:02:37.23,00:02:37.23,The new Maraamu was the obvious
108,00:02:39.00,00:02:39.00,"underdog, but after an initial"
109,00:02:40.67,00:02:40.67,"loss, resulting in one tribe"
110,00:02:42.27,00:02:42.27,"member's departure, the tiny"
111,00:02:43.83,00:02:43.83,tribe of three women and the
112,00:02:45.43,00:02:45.43,oldest male castaway came
113,00:02:46.83,00:02:46.83,roaring back to win three
114,00:02:48.27,00:02:48.27,challenges in a row.
115,00:02:49.73,00:02:49.73,Maraamu wins feast.
116,00:02:51.13,00:02:51.13,"At Rotu, John led an alliance"

118,00:02:55.57,00:02:55.57,that seemed destined to go to
119,00:02:57.73,00:02:57.73,the end.
120,00:02:58.13,00:02:58.13,>> We made ourselves a little
121,00:02:59.57,00:02:59.57,pact that we're going to try to
122,00:03:01.20,00:03:01.20,control this and take it down to
123,00:03:02.80,00:03:02.80,be the final four people.

125,00:03:05.50,00:03:05.50,will come out of this group.
126,00:03:06.93,00:03:06.93,>> PROBST: After the alliance
127,00:03:08.63,00:03:08.63,claimed their first victim and

135,00:03:22.07,00:03:22.07,"disappeared, when an argument"
136,00:03:23.33,00:03:23.33,broke out over voting
137,00:03:24.30,00:03:24.30,strategies.

152,00:03:45.20,00:03:45.20,decided to dismantle John's
153,00:03:46.80,00:03:46.80,alliance.
154,00:03:47.20,00:03:47.20,>> I'm not going to go out fifth

163,00:03:58.37,00:03:58.37,So now the new agreement we have
164,00:03:59.90,00:03:59.90,"is myself, Neleh, V, Paschal and"
165,00:04:01.50,00:04:01.50,Kathy.

171,00:04:09.30,00:04:09.30,one.
172,00:04:09.57,00:04:09.57,Only five survivors remained.

175,00:04:13.90,00:04:13.90,and found herself caught between

177,00:04:17.93,00:04:17.93,"At a heated Tribal Council,"
178,00:04:19.67,00:04:19.67,"tempers flared, as Sean and"
179,00:04:21.33,00:04:21.33,Paschal fought for Kathy's vote.
180,00:04:23.43,00:04:23.43,>> That tells me a lot of what
181,00:04:24.93,00:04:24.93,Sean's been doing and thinking
182,00:04:26.47,00:04:26.47,and I think he's disingenuous.
183,00:04:28.00,00:04:28.00,>> I don't think it was
184,00:04:29.17,00:04:29.17,disingenuous.
185,00:04:29.83,00:04:29.83,"What I think is, five minutes"

218,00:06:50.77,00:06:50.77,I'm not okay with that vote.
219,00:06:53.07,00:06:53.07,Forget it. Nope.

346,00:11:01.30,00:11:01.30,So to keep that from even being

652,00:20:05.97,00:20:05.97,"Neleh tonight, anyway, so..."
653,00:20:07.30,00:20:07.30,>> Okay.
654,00:20:07.67,00:20:07.67,>> I would say vote off Neleh.
655,00:20:09.10,00:20:09.10,If you don't feel that's
656,00:20:10.27,00:20:10.27,right...
657,00:20:10.63,00:20:10.63,">> No, that's fine."
658,00:20:11.53,00:20:11.53,>> ...we can vote Paschal then.
659,00:20:13.00,00:20:13.00,>> PROBST: Do you guys have a
660,00:20:14.40,00:20:14.40,plan?
661,00:20:14.63,00:20:14.63,>> Yeah.
662,00:20:15.00,00:20:15.00,>> PROBST: Okay.
663,00:20:15.77,00:20:15.77,Thoughts from you guys?
664,00:20:16.87,00:20:16.87,">> I mean, you know, Paschal and"
665,00:20:18.40,00:20:18.40,I have come this far together
666,00:20:19.77,00:20:19.77,"and whether it's me or Paschal,"
667,00:20:21.27,00:20:21.27,I don't care.
668,00:20:22.00,00:20:22.00,>> PROBST: Kathy?
669,00:20:23.00,00:20:23.00,>> I always knew that I was on
670,00:20:24.73,00:20:24.73,the chopping block when I got
671,00:20:26.40,00:20:26.40,down to the final three with
672,00:20:28.03,00:20:28.03,"Neleh and Paschal, and it's very"
673,00:20:29.87,00:20:29.87,difficult to make the decisions
674,00:20:31.67,00:20:31.67,because they're very tight.
675,00:20:33.23,00:20:33.23,As you can see my voice is even
676,00:20:35.03,00:20:35.03,quivering.
677,00:20:39.03,00:20:39.03,So that's it.
678,00:20:42.40,00:20:42.40,>> PROBST: Okay.
679,00:20:43.47,00:20:43.47,It is now time to vote.
680,00:20:45.07,00:20:45.07,"Paschal, you first."
681,00:20:47.67,00:20:47.67,>> Don't worry.
682,00:21:04.47,00:21:04.47,Simply an amazing woman.
683,00:21:33.63,00:21:33.63,">> Kathy, my vote tonight is for"
684,00:21:35.67,00:21:35.67,you.
685,00:21:36.27,00:21:36.27,"I said I would never, ever vote"
686,00:21:37.70,00:21:37.70,against Paschal.
687,00:21:38.43,00:21:38.43,Looks like it's going to be a
688,00:21:39.77,00:21:39.77,"tie-breaker, and I'm definitely"
689,00:21:41.23,00:21:41.23,not ready to leave.
690,00:21:48.27,00:21:48.27,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
691,00:21:49.73,00:21:49.73,votes.
692,00:22:03.67,00:22:03.67,"Once the votes are read, the"
693,00:22:05.40,00:22:05.40,decision is final.
694,00:22:06.70,00:22:06.70,The person will be asked to
695,00:22:07.97,00:22:07.97,leave the Tribal Council area
696,00:22:09.30,00:22:09.30,immediately.
697,00:22:09.87,00:22:09.87,I'll read the votes.
698,00:22:12.10,00:22:12.10,"First vote, Neleh."
699,00:22:19.23,00:22:19.23,Kathy.
700,00:22:20.37,00:22:20.37,"One vote Neleh, one vote Kathy."
701,00:22:25.57,00:22:25.57,Kathy.
702,00:22:27.10,00:22:27.10,Last vote.
703,00:22:29.93,00:22:29.93,Neleh.
704,00:22:31.57,00:22:31.57,We're tied two votes each.
705,00:22:35.30,00:22:35.30,Okay.
706,00:22:36.60,00:22:36.60,Here's how a tie-breaker works.
707,00:22:38.23,00:22:38.23,Previous votes don't count.
708,00:22:39.70,00:22:39.70,There's no Q & A.
709,00:22:40.60,00:22:40.60,I'm going to give you two
710,00:22:41.93,00:22:41.93,minutes to discuss who should
711,00:22:43.50,00:22:43.50,stay and who should go.
712,00:22:44.70,00:22:44.70,"At the end of two minutes, you"
713,00:22:46.33,00:22:46.33,need to come to a unanimous
714,00:22:47.77,00:22:47.77,decision as to whether you're
715,00:22:49.33,00:22:49.33,voting out Neleh or Kathy.
716,00:22:51.17,00:22:51.17,"If there's no consensus, it will"
717,00:22:53.40,00:22:53.40,come down to what's in this bag.
718,00:22:55.67,00:22:55.67,Three rocks in it.
719,00:22:56.93,00:22:56.93,"Two rocks are yellow, that's"
720,00:22:58.93,00:22:58.93,safe.
721,00:22:59.70,00:22:59.70,One rock is purple and that
722,00:23:01.20,00:23:01.20,means you're out of the game.
723,00:23:02.73,00:23:02.73,The only person who won't have
724,00:23:04.33,00:23:04.33,to reach into this bag tonight
725,00:23:05.93,00:23:05.93,is V.
726,00:23:06.43,00:23:06.43,She has immunity.
727,00:23:07.57,00:23:07.57,So you have two minutes to
728,00:23:09.33,00:23:09.33,decide yourselves or it goes to
729,00:23:11.43,00:23:11.43,"chance, which is a lousy way to"
730,00:23:13.53,00:23:13.53,leave after 37 days.
731,00:23:14.50,00:23:14.50,>> I agree.
732,00:23:15.07,00:23:15.07,">> Well, I've played this game"
733,00:23:16.53,00:23:16.53,"honestly, fairly."
734,00:23:17.40,00:23:17.40,"You know, the entire time I've"
735,00:23:18.87,00:23:18.87,loved every single minute of
736,00:23:20.27,00:23:20.27,this whole entire game.
737,00:23:21.40,00:23:21.40,"If I leave tonight, I'm gonna"
738,00:23:22.83,00:23:22.83,leave with a smile and high
739,00:23:24.20,00:23:24.20,head.
740,00:23:24.47,00:23:24.47,">> Um, I think I worked hard."
741,00:23:26.07,00:23:26.07,I think I was very honest and it
742,00:23:27.83,00:23:27.83,was just hard to jockey around
743,00:23:29.50,00:23:29.50,"your pact, so I think I provided"
744,00:23:31.27,00:23:31.27,well and I got food and the
745,00:23:32.73,00:23:32.73,adventure that I just went
746,00:23:34.17,00:23:34.17,through is going to change my
747,00:23:35.80,00:23:35.80,life back at home.
748,00:23:36.57,00:23:36.57,">> Neleh, not taking anything"
749,00:23:37.83,00:23:37.83,"from you, I love your spirit."
750,00:23:39.07,00:23:39.07,>> Yeah.
751,00:23:39.43,00:23:39.43,>> And I thank goodness that it
752,00:23:40.77,00:23:40.77,"was there, but I have to go with"
753,00:23:42.17,00:23:42.17,Kathy.
754,00:23:42.80,00:23:42.80,>> Paschal?
755,00:23:43.47,00:23:43.47,>> You've got to look at the
756,00:23:45.17,00:23:45.17,ultimate goal in this and that's
757,00:23:47.13,00:23:47.13,to stay in at the end.
758,00:23:48.50,00:23:48.50,I think whoever's making the
759,00:23:50.23,00:23:50.23,decision would be foolish to put
760,00:23:52.20,00:23:52.20,"Kathy in the finals, because"
761,00:23:53.90,00:23:53.90,Kathy is quite capable of
762,00:23:55.43,00:23:55.43,"winning any immunity, much more"
763,00:23:57.37,00:23:57.37,so than Neleh.
764,00:23:58.00,00:23:58.00,">> We can't do unanimous, it's"
765,00:23:59.40,00:23:59.40,not going to work.
766,00:24:00.30,00:24:00.30,">> So, we have to draw rocks."
767,00:24:01.63,00:24:01.63,">> Yep, which is too bad."
768,00:24:02.80,00:24:02.80,>> PROBST: Where you guys at?
769,00:24:04.17,00:24:04.17,>> Drawing rocks.
770,00:24:05.07,00:24:05.07,">> Drawing rocks, to me, seems"
771,00:24:06.67,00:24:06.67,like the fairest thing.
772,00:24:07.87,00:24:07.87,>> PROBST: It's fair for you
773,00:24:09.37,00:24:09.37,guys.
774,00:24:09.63,00:24:09.63,"Paschal, a guy who had no votes"
775,00:24:11.27,00:24:11.27,"cast tonight, is now vulnerable."
776,00:24:13.00,00:24:13.00,So because together you guys
777,00:24:14.47,00:24:14.47,couldn't make a decision as to
778,00:24:16.07,00:24:16.07,"who to vote out, it's now out of"
779,00:24:17.77,00:24:17.77,your hands.
780,00:24:18.37,00:24:18.37,You're leaving it up to chance.
781,00:24:20.00,00:24:20.00,Here's what's going to happen.
782,00:24:21.60,00:24:21.60,"Neleh, first you'll grab a rock,"
783,00:24:23.30,00:24:23.30,"then Kathy, then Paschal."
784,00:24:24.63,00:24:24.63,Very important you don't
785,00:24:25.93,00:24:25.93,look at the rock.
786,00:24:26.87,00:24:26.87,"When I tell you to, you'll all"
787,00:24:28.50,00:24:28.50,three put your hands in the
788,00:24:30.00,00:24:30.00,middle and open it up.
789,00:24:31.23,00:24:31.23,Here I come.
790,00:24:31.87,00:24:31.87,>> All right.
791,00:24:32.57,00:24:32.57,>> Good luck.
792,00:24:33.30,00:24:33.30,">> Good luck, everybody."
793,00:24:34.60,00:24:34.60,>> PROBST: Yellow is safe.
794,00:24:36.03,00:24:36.03,Purple means you're going home.
795,00:24:46.37,00:24:46.37,">> Well, that feels like purple,"
796,00:24:47.83,00:24:47.83,Jeff.
797,00:24:49.03,00:24:49.03,(laughter)

799,00:24:54.17,00:24:54.17,I got ourselves into this gnarly
800,00:24:55.23,00:24:55.23,mess.

867,00:27:16.07,00:27:16.07,pay tribute to your former tribe
868,00:27:17.83,00:27:17.83,mates.
869,00:27:18.20,00:27:18.20,"Finally, you will cleanse"
870,00:27:19.77,00:27:19.77,yourself with a Marquesan
871,00:27:21.37,00:27:21.37,"purification bath, before"
872,00:27:22.93,00:27:22.93,meeting me at the final part of
873,00:27:24.90,00:27:24.90,your immunity challenge.
874,00:27:26.43,00:27:26.43,All right?
875,00:27:27.03,00:27:27.03,Here's a map with your journey.
876,00:27:29.00,00:27:29.00,I suggest you build a fire.
877,00:27:30.70,00:27:30.70,"It's a long day, and you'll be"
878,00:27:32.60,00:27:32.60,leaving here in an hour.
879,00:27:35.00,00:27:35.00,">> So, where's the"
880,00:27:36.37,00:27:36.37,Soliantu camp?
881,00:27:37.17,00:27:37.17,Where's Challenge Beach?
882,00:27:38.70,00:27:38.70,>> This is challenge immunity
883,00:27:40.33,00:27:40.33,right there.
884,00:27:41.03,00:27:41.03,>> Right there.
885,00:27:41.90,00:27:41.90,Anything else that it says?
886,00:27:43.43,00:27:43.43,I'm blind as a bat.
887,00:27:44.50,00:27:44.50,">> It just says ""mountain"
888,00:27:45.93,00:27:45.93,"range."""
889,00:27:46.33,00:27:46.33,>> Yeah.
890,00:27:46.80,00:27:46.80,>> Okay.
891,00:27:47.27,00:27:47.27,>> First we have to disassemble
892,00:27:48.57,00:27:48.57,a raft?
893,00:27:49.03,00:27:49.03,">> No, we have to assemble an"
894,00:27:51.03,00:27:51.03,outrigger.
895,00:27:51.60,00:27:51.60,>> Putting the outrigger canoe
896,00:27:53.30,00:27:53.30,together was quite easy.
897,00:27:54.67,00:27:54.67,Myself and Kathy are pretty good
898,00:27:56.50,00:27:56.50,knot-tyers.
899,00:27:57.13,00:27:57.13,>> Go around this way to tighten
900,00:27:58.97,00:27:58.97,it up once.
901,00:28:00.93,00:28:00.93,">> We kind of like just stepped up, put that rigger canoe"
902,00:28:04.13,00:28:04.13,"together, like the chicks that"
903,00:28:05.77,00:28:05.77,"we are, and Neleh went ahead and"
904,00:28:07.57,00:28:07.57,"prepared the water, got the"
905,00:28:09.07,00:28:09.07,canteens ready.
906,00:28:10.93,00:28:10.93,">> The key is, does that go to the stern or the bow?"
907,00:28:13.60,00:28:13.60,
908,00:28:13.97,00:28:13.97,"Okay, I got it."
909,00:28:15.00,00:28:15.00,This will go over the canoe like
910,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,this.
911,00:28:17.20,00:28:17.20,>> Yup.
912,00:28:17.67,00:28:17.67,">> Yep, perfect."
913,00:28:18.80,00:28:18.80,">> So, three women working"
914,00:28:20.57,00:28:20.57,"together, those heads worked"
915,00:28:22.50,00:28:22.50,"pretty dang good together, I"
916,00:28:24.43,00:28:24.43,should say so.
917,00:28:25.43,00:28:25.43,>> Take it slow.
918,00:28:29.37,00:28:29.37,">> I can't find the words yet,"
919,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10,what it's like to be on that
920,00:28:32.73,00:28:32.73,beach for that long.
921,00:28:33.93,00:28:33.93,">> Okay, girls, you ready?"
922,00:28:35.83,00:28:35.83,">> Paddling away from it, and we knew something was ahead of us"
923,00:28:38.80,00:28:38.80,that was going to be probably
924,00:28:40.17,00:28:40.17,challenging but also really
925,00:28:41.43,00:28:41.43,good.
926,00:28:42.83,00:28:42.83,"It felt great. It was exhilarating, it was fun,"
927,00:28:45.80,00:28:45.80,it was a sense of release and
928,00:28:47.63,00:28:47.63,power.
929,00:28:48.03,00:28:48.03,">> Guys, as we're going, I'm"
930,00:28:49.67,00:28:49.67,going to say a prayer.
931,00:28:50.97,00:28:50.97,"Father God, in the name of Jesus"
932,00:28:52.87,00:28:52.87,I thank you for...
933,00:29:16.50,00:29:16.50,(indistinct shouting)
934,00:29:31.47,00:29:31.47,>> All right.
935,00:29:33.20,00:29:33.20,">> All right, woman."
936,00:29:34.97,00:29:34.97,>> It's so exciting.
937,00:29:38.17,00:29:38.17,">> You guys, this is so neat."
938,00:29:40.10,00:29:40.10,"Seriously, what an experience."
939,00:29:42.10,00:29:42.10,You know?
940,00:29:42.73,00:29:42.73,>> Yep.
941,00:29:43.20,00:29:43.20,">> You guys, this looks like it"
942,00:29:45.30,00:29:45.30,right here.
943,00:29:46.03,00:29:46.03,>> This is so cool!
944,00:29:47.30,00:29:47.30,>> We'll all do fun stuff on
945,00:29:49.20,00:29:49.20,each other.
946,00:29:49.97,00:29:49.97,>> Whoo!
947,00:29:50.33,00:29:50.33,">> I don't want to talk now,"
948,00:29:51.70,00:29:51.70,because I don't want to...
949,00:29:52.97,00:29:52.97,I'm just...
950,00:29:53.47,00:29:53.47,>> I know.
951,00:29:53.97,00:29:53.97,>> ...reflecting on
952,00:29:54.90,00:29:54.90,everything.
953,00:29:55.43,00:29:55.43,>> I am.
954,00:29:55.80,00:29:55.80,">> I am, too."
955,00:29:56.43,00:29:56.43,"I am reflecting, totally."
956,00:29:57.63,00:29:57.63,">> Oh, I love this."
957,00:29:58.57,00:29:58.57,"Seriously, every step I go along"
958,00:30:00.10,00:30:00.10,I just love it more and more
959,00:30:01.47,00:30:01.47,and it means more and more to
960,00:30:02.87,00:30:02.87,"me, you know?"
961,00:30:03.50,00:30:03.50,My tattoos mean a ton of stuff.
962,00:30:06.57,00:30:06.57,"is mainly, like, my family,"
963,00:30:07.87,00:30:07.87,because they're by far the most
964,00:30:09.37,00:30:09.37,important thing in this
965,00:30:10.63,00:30:10.63,entire world to me.
966,00:30:12.57,00:30:12.57,"My leg, of course, this is my original Rotu tribe that I"
967,00:30:15.47,00:30:15.47,"started out with, and I put"
968,00:30:16.87,00:30:16.87,"""love"" just because I"
969,00:30:17.93,00:30:17.93,seriously love every single
970,00:30:19.30,00:30:19.30,person that I've met out here
971,00:30:20.80,00:30:20.80,and I love the experience that
972,00:30:22.33,00:30:22.33,I've been able to have.
973,00:30:23.50,00:30:23.50,(laughter)
974,00:30:24.03,00:30:24.03,>> When I think of some of the
975,00:30:25.57,00:30:25.57,"people, if they were here"
976,00:30:26.83,00:30:26.83,"watching me, they'd think I'm"
977,00:30:28.33,00:30:28.33,insane because they wouldn't get
978,00:30:29.97,00:30:29.97,it.
979,00:30:30.13,00:30:30.13,>> They're going to love it.
980,00:30:31.57,00:30:31.57,>> But they still wouldn't get
981,00:30:33.10,00:30:33.10,it.
982,00:30:33.23,00:30:33.23,"Like, have you lost your"
983,00:30:34.47,00:30:34.47,marbles?
984,00:30:34.90,00:30:34.90,">> No, that was yesterday,"
985,00:30:36.23,00:30:36.23,Kathy.
986,00:30:36.63,00:30:36.63,>> I lost my marbles yesterday?
987,00:30:38.87,00:30:38.87,>> I have 16 tribes members on
988,00:30:41.03,00:30:41.03,my leg dancing.
989,00:30:42.10,00:30:42.10,"A waterfall, because it gave me"
990,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,so much strength during the hard
991,00:30:46.63,00:30:46.63,times.
992,00:30:47.03,00:30:47.03,The sun showering down upon us
993,00:30:49.20,00:30:49.20,into a little love fest.
994,00:30:50.93,00:30:50.93,>> Does that look right?
995,00:30:52.63,00:30:52.63,Vision?
996,00:30:53.13,00:30:53.13,"Did I spell ""vision"" right?"
997,00:30:55.10,00:30:55.10,>> I can't see. (chuckles)
998,00:30:56.97,00:30:56.97,>> I saw tattooing as an
999,00:30:58.63,00:30:58.63,opportunity for me to reflect
1000,00:31:00.73,00:31:00.73,personally on my own odyssey.
1001,00:31:02.93,00:31:02.93,This is supposed to be 16 people representing fire.
1002,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,
1003,00:31:05.63,00:31:05.63,Each one has the person's name
1004,00:31:07.33,00:31:07.33,and the number in which they
1005,00:31:08.97,00:31:08.97,have been voted off.
1006,00:31:10.43,00:31:10.43,"Peter one, Patricia two,"
1007,00:31:12.20,00:31:12.20,Hunter...
1008,00:31:12.87,00:31:12.87,"It stops at number 13, which was"
1009,00:31:15.27,00:31:15.27,Paschal English.
1010,00:31:16.00,00:31:16.00,It was so funny because the Rotu
1011,00:31:17.47,00:31:17.47,people asked me if there was
1012,00:31:18.80,00:31:18.80,anybody I would like to be in
1013,00:31:20.13,00:31:20.13,the finals with who would it be
1014,00:31:21.57,00:31:21.57,"and I said with Kathy, you know."
1015,00:31:23.07,00:31:23.07,"We both have a 50-50 shot, I'd"
1016,00:31:24.47,00:31:24.47,say.
1017,00:31:24.63,00:31:24.63,>> Yeah.
1018,00:31:25.03,00:31:25.03,>> But as far as deserving of
1019,00:31:26.37,00:31:26.37,it...
1020,00:31:26.60,00:31:26.60,">> Yeah, yeah..."
1021,00:31:27.33,00:31:27.33,>> ...to be up there...
1022,00:31:28.27,00:31:28.27,>> Yeah.
1023,00:31:28.63,00:31:28.63,>> ...definitely Kathy.
1024,00:31:29.70,00:31:29.70,>> You haven't won yet.
1025,00:31:30.80,00:31:30.80,>> Thank you.
1026,00:31:31.40,00:31:31.40,>> Huh?
1027,00:31:31.70,00:31:31.70,>> You guys haven't won yet.
1028,00:31:33.00,00:31:33.00,>> What do you mean?
1029,00:31:33.93,00:31:33.93,">> Oh, no, we were just in"
1030,00:31:35.17,00:31:35.17,theory.
1031,00:31:35.47,00:31:35.47,>> Yeah...
1032,00:31:35.93,00:31:35.93,>> Just in theory.
1033,00:31:36.80,00:31:36.80,">> Right now, I mean, there's a"
1034,00:31:38.37,00:31:38.37,"lot of arrogance in the air, you"
1035,00:31:40.03,00:31:40.03,"know, between V and Kathy."
1036,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,It's been kind of annoying today
1037,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,"to tell you the truth, sitting"
1038,00:31:44.53,00:31:44.53,over there on the mat finishing
1039,00:31:46.13,00:31:46.13,"up my tattooing and hearing, you"
1040,00:31:47.77,00:31:47.77,"know, her tell Kathy ""Oh, if I"
1041,00:31:49.30,00:31:49.30,"would have, you know, had to"
1042,00:31:50.73,00:31:50.73,make it to the two I definitely
1043,00:31:52.33,00:31:52.33,"knew it was going to be you"" and"
1044,00:31:53.97,00:31:53.97,all this drama.
1045,00:31:54.77,00:31:54.77,It's like throwing it in your
1046,00:31:56.33,00:31:56.33,face which I don't think is very
1047,00:31:58.07,00:31:58.07,good sportsmanship.
1048,00:34:52.43,00:34:52.43,>> (sobbing): I love you.
1049,00:35:50.40,00:35:50.40,>> I don't think we're there yet.
1050,00:35:52.20,00:35:52.20,You guys okay back there?
1051,00:35:53.37,00:35:53.37,>> Uh-huh.
1052,00:35:54.07,00:35:54.07,>> Yep.
1053,00:35:55.37,00:35:55.37,>> We got off the ridge and we
1054,00:35:57.00,00:35:57.00,hiked to an area of
1055,00:35:58.07,00:35:58.07,purification.
1056,00:35:59.97,00:35:59.97,">> Oh, wow. >> This is wild."
1057,00:36:02.60,00:36:02.60,">> Apparently, the Marquesans do"
1058,00:36:05.53,00:36:05.53,some type of baptismal ritual
1059,00:36:08.20,00:36:08.20,"with manui oils, ginger, and"
1060,00:36:10.77,00:36:10.77,God knows what else.
1061,00:36:12.07,00:36:12.07,">> God, it smells good."
1062,00:36:13.57,00:36:13.57,">> You guys, we need to say a"
1063,00:36:15.47,00:36:15.47,prayer over this.
1064,00:36:16.57,00:36:16.57,">> Yes, we do."
1065,00:36:17.50,00:36:17.50,>> So being that this was really
1066,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,"the last rites, in a way, of us"
1067,00:36:22.13,00:36:22.13,"being here, we took a moment of"
1068,00:36:24.43,00:36:24.43,prayer to recall our journey
1069,00:36:26.50,00:36:26.50,from the beginning of the day.
1070,00:36:27.87,00:36:27.87,>> We're so grateful for the
1071,00:36:29.07,00:36:29.07,strength to get this far and
1072,00:36:30.43,00:36:30.43,for all the energy that we've
1073,00:36:31.77,00:36:31.77,had.
1074,00:36:31.97,00:36:31.97,">> Yes, yes..."

1076,00:36:33.90,00:36:33.90,time that we have to be together
1077,00:36:35.37,00:36:35.37,and please watch over and

1292,00:44:22.77,00:44:22.77,You guys have been through a lot
1293,00:44:24.57,00:44:24.57,"in 38 days, not going to hide"
1294,00:44:26.17,00:44:26.17,anything from you now.
1295,00:44:27.40,00:44:27.40,Just before Tribal Council was
1296,00:44:29.17,00:44:29.17,"to begin, Paschal collapsed."
1297,00:44:33.47,00:44:33.47,He's been evacuated to medical
1298,00:44:36.73,00:44:36.73,care.
1299,00:44:38.23,00:44:38.23,"He's in excellent hands, and,"
1300,00:44:40.43,00:44:40.43,"luckily for us, one of your own"
1301,00:44:42.80,00:44:42.80,tribe members is also a
1302,00:44:44.57,00:44:44.57,registered nurse.
1303,00:44:45.47,00:44:45.47,"John was there, and if you"
1304,00:44:46.87,00:44:46.87,"wouldn't mind, this is your"
1305,00:44:48.33,00:44:48.33,tribe.
1306,00:44:49.03,00:44:49.03,Would you just put their minds
1307,00:44:50.80,00:44:50.80,at ease and tell them what
1308,00:44:52.33,00:44:52.33,happened with Paschal?
1309,00:44:53.63,00:44:53.63,>> Shortly before we came here
1310,00:44:55.30,00:44:55.30,he basically just kind of
1311,00:44:56.73,00:44:56.73,"fainted on his feet, and he's"
1312,00:44:58.37,00:44:58.37,just showing signs of
1313,00:44:59.57,00:44:59.57,dehydration.
1314,00:45:00.30,00:45:00.30,Everything looked real good.
1315,00:45:01.90,00:45:01.90,He's within normal limits.
1316,00:45:03.37,00:45:03.37,"He was talking, he was alert, he"
1317,00:45:05.17,00:45:05.17,knew where he was.
1318,00:45:06.17,00:45:06.17,"So we said a prayer, and he's"
1319,00:45:07.83,00:45:07.83,going to be okay.
1320,00:45:08.80,00:45:08.80,Okay? Okay.
1321,00:45:10.77,00:45:10.77,>> I'm just glad he's okay.
1322,00:45:12.40,00:45:12.40,">> Yeah. I'm glad he's okay,"
1323,00:45:13.37,00:45:13.37,too.
1324,00:45:14.10,00:45:14.10,>> PROBST: We have a Tribal
1325,00:45:15.23,00:45:15.23,Council to deal with.
1326,00:45:16.10,00:45:16.10,If you guys are okay to go
1327,00:45:17.23,00:45:17.23,ahead?
1328,00:45:18.23,00:45:18.23,Long day.
1329,00:45:20.03,00:45:20.03,Highs and lows for everybody.
1330,00:45:22.60,00:45:22.60,We get to an immunity challenge
1331,00:45:25.50,00:45:25.50,where it really is about
1332,00:45:27.43,00:45:27.43,"willpower, ultimately."
1333,00:45:29.13,00:45:29.13,You guys wanted it.
1334,00:45:30.63,00:45:30.63,"You hung on for a long time, and"
1335,00:45:33.13,00:45:33.13,then what happens?
1336,00:45:35.90,00:45:35.90,>> I just lost my concentration.
1337,00:45:37.73,00:45:37.73,I looked down and I was
1338,00:45:39.20,00:45:39.20,correcting my shirt and I fell
1339,00:45:40.60,00:45:40.60,off.
1340,00:45:41.77,00:45:41.77,So it was totally concentration.
1341,00:45:43.33,00:45:43.33,It was my own fault.
1342,00:45:44.50,00:45:44.50,So it's not a big deal.
1343,00:45:46.20,00:45:46.20,"I, you know, I was getting tired"
1344,00:45:47.60,00:45:47.60,"anyway, I was going to give it"
1345,00:45:49.10,00:45:49.10,one more hour and then I had
1346,00:45:50.30,00:45:50.30,to... I had to cash out.
1347,00:45:51.33,00:45:51.33,">> Yeah, and it was totally... I"
1348,00:45:52.70,00:45:52.70,just did not want herself
1349,00:45:53.77,00:45:53.77,exposed.
1350,00:45:54.13,00:45:54.13,>> Yeah.
1351,00:45:54.47,00:45:54.47,>> It wasn't anything trying to
1352,00:45:55.80,00:45:55.80,lure her off or anything.
1353,00:45:56.87,00:45:56.87,">> No, no, not at all, so..."
1354,00:45:58.10,00:45:58.10,>> PROBST: You fell off the
1355,00:45:59.17,00:45:59.17,stump.
1356,00:45:59.80,00:45:59.80,>> Yeah.
1357,00:46:00.47,00:46:00.47,">> PROBST: Before you know it,"
1358,00:46:01.93,00:46:01.93,"V's made a deal with Neleh, like"
1359,00:46:03.53,00:46:03.53,that.
1360,00:46:06.13,00:46:06.13,>> I know.
1361,00:46:06.90,00:46:06.90,"I was disappointed, because I"
1362,00:46:08.07,00:46:08.07,thought we had a little thing
1363,00:46:09.27,00:46:09.27,"going on, but you know what?"
1364,00:46:10.43,00:46:10.43,What goes around comes around.
1365,00:46:11.67,00:46:11.67,"I negotiated a deal yesterday,"
1366,00:46:12.90,00:46:12.90,she negotiated a deal today.
1367,00:46:14.07,00:46:14.07,It seems like that's what's
1368,00:46:15.17,00:46:15.17,happening with the game.
1369,00:46:16.17,00:46:16.17,We're doing deals every five
1370,00:46:17.33,00:46:17.33,hours.
1371,00:46:17.70,00:46:17.70,"So, I was disappointed."
1372,00:46:19.10,00:46:19.10,I thought we were going to ride
1373,00:46:21.00,00:46:21.00,"it but, you know what, c'est la"
1374,00:46:22.90,00:46:22.90,"vie, what can you do?"
1375,00:46:24.20,00:46:24.20,">> PROBST: Vecepia, what was"
1376,00:46:26.23,00:46:26.23,your obligation to Kathy at that
1377,00:46:28.57,00:46:28.57,point?
1378,00:46:29.03,00:46:29.03,">> To be honest, um, when I"
1379,00:46:31.27,00:46:31.27,think about what we discussed
1380,00:46:33.73,00:46:33.73,"yesterday, I don't recall"
1381,00:46:35.80,00:46:35.80,anything about me trying to
1382,00:46:38.10,00:46:38.10,carry her.
1383,00:46:39.03,00:46:39.03,>> Hmm...
1384,00:46:39.93,00:46:39.93,>> When she told me that she was
1385,00:46:41.57,00:46:41.57,"having cramps I said, ""Well, how"
1386,00:46:43.20,00:46:43.20,"much longer can you last?"""
1387,00:46:44.53,00:46:44.53,But then all of a sudden she
1388,00:46:45.97,00:46:45.97,"fell, and then at that point I"
1389,00:46:47.50,00:46:47.50,"was, like, ""Okay, so am I... am"
1390,00:46:49.10,00:46:49.10,I carrying her?
1391,00:46:49.87,00:46:49.87,Is that part of our agreement?
1392,00:46:51.40,00:46:51.40,"I'm not sure."""
1393,00:46:52.13,00:46:52.13,">> Well, I thought we did."
1394,00:46:53.47,00:46:53.47,I actually thought we did.
1395,00:46:54.80,00:46:54.80,">> And I said at that time, the"
1396,00:46:56.40,00:46:56.40,"best thing to do... I mean, I"
1397,00:46:57.87,00:46:57.87,could have stayed up there for
1398,00:46:59.43,00:46:59.43,another three hours.
1399,00:47:00.53,00:47:00.53,"I was okay, but I said, you"
1400,00:47:02.47,00:47:02.47,"know, the best thing to do right"
1401,00:47:04.77,00:47:04.77,"now, we can stop this charade."
1402,00:47:06.93,00:47:06.93,"I can just ask ""Neleh, hey, you"
1403,00:47:09.20,00:47:09.20,want to end it?
1404,00:47:10.27,00:47:10.27,I'll give you the immunity if
1405,00:47:12.37,00:47:12.37,"you give me the spot."""
1406,00:47:13.97,00:47:13.97,And so I did that.
1407,00:47:14.80,00:47:14.80,">> PROBST: Neleh, were you going"
1408,00:47:16.37,00:47:16.37,to outlast V?
1409,00:47:16.97,00:47:16.97,">> You know, I was not going to"
1410,00:47:18.47,00:47:18.47,go down today without a fight.
1411,00:47:19.93,00:47:19.93,I've been on the chopping board
1412,00:47:21.40,00:47:21.40,for two days now.
1413,00:47:22.23,00:47:22.23,All day long I have known that
1414,00:47:23.67,00:47:23.67,if I didn't win this immunity
1415,00:47:25.07,00:47:25.07,"tonight, that I was going to be"
1416,00:47:26.57,00:47:26.57,the one that was leaving
1417,00:47:27.73,00:47:27.73,tonight.
1418,00:47:28.27,00:47:28.27,And I wasn't about to give up.
1419,00:47:30.37,00:47:30.37,"And so, you know, when it was"
1420,00:47:32.40,00:47:32.40,"offered to me, definitely, you"
1421,00:47:34.50,00:47:34.50,"know, I took it."
1422,00:47:35.63,00:47:35.63,>> PROBST: Let me ask you a
1423,00:47:36.93,00:47:36.93,question.
1424,00:47:37.73,00:47:37.73,Both you and V have been very
1425,00:47:39.23,00:47:39.23,open and very vocal about your
1426,00:47:40.83,00:47:40.83,"beliefs, spiritual beliefs,"
1427,00:47:42.27,00:47:42.27,religious beliefs.
1428,00:47:43.43,00:47:43.43,"Kathy, faith play any part for"
1429,00:47:45.43,00:47:45.43,you out here?
1430,00:47:46.30,00:47:46.30,>> Yeah.
1431,00:47:46.87,00:47:46.87,"I was on those logs, and I was"
1432,00:47:48.37,00:47:48.37,"praying just to get through it,"
1433,00:47:49.93,00:47:49.93,just to get through it.
1434,00:47:51.07,00:47:51.07,And there were a lot of other
1435,00:47:52.53,00:47:52.53,deep thoughts that were going
1436,00:47:54.00,00:47:54.00,through my mind to keep me
1437,00:47:55.33,00:47:55.33,going.
1438,00:47:55.83,00:47:55.83,>> PROBST: Like what?
1439,00:47:57.30,00:47:57.30,">> Oh, you know, let's see."
1440,00:47:59.23,00:47:59.23,I hung by my dad's bedside for
1441,00:48:01.40,00:48:01.40,five hours while he died and I
1442,00:48:03.53,00:48:03.53,"said, ""If I can do that,"" and he"
1443,00:48:05.80,00:48:05.80,would want me to hang in on
1444,00:48:07.73,00:48:07.73,those logs.
1445,00:48:08.50,00:48:08.50,I really focused on that for
1446,00:48:10.50,00:48:10.50,quite some time.
1447,00:48:11.63,00:48:11.63,In addition to saying the Lord's
1448,00:48:13.90,00:48:13.90,Prayer and also just... just
1449,00:48:15.87,00:48:15.87,talking to my father.
1450,00:48:17.37,00:48:17.37,"It was pretty cool, because I"
1451,00:48:19.43,00:48:19.43,haven't been doing that.
1452,00:48:20.93,00:48:20.93,">> PROBST: Nice feeling, it"
1453,00:48:22.67,00:48:22.67,looks like.
1454,00:48:23.37,00:48:23.37,>> It was great.
1455,00:48:24.40,00:48:24.40,I haven't talked to him in
1456,00:48:26.07,00:48:26.07,years.
1457,00:48:28.07,00:48:28.07,I guess I just had to go deep.
1458,00:48:35.47,00:48:35.47,">> PROBST: Well, a big vote."
1459,00:48:37.97,00:48:37.97,"Kathy, V, you can't vote for"
1460,00:48:40.53,00:48:40.53,Neleh.
1461,00:48:41.13,00:48:41.13,"You can't vote for yourselves,"
1462,00:48:42.67,00:48:42.67,so therefore you can only vote
1463,00:48:44.20,00:48:44.20,"for each other, so you cancel"
1464,00:48:45.70,00:48:45.70,each other out.
1465,00:48:46.63,00:48:46.63,You won't vote.
1466,00:48:47.60,00:48:47.60,Neleh will be the only person
1467,00:48:49.43,00:48:49.43,casting a vote.
1468,00:48:50.37,00:48:50.37,"Interesting thing is, within the"
1469,00:48:52.40,00:48:52.40,"last two Tribal Councils, each"
1470,00:48:54.30,00:48:54.30,one of you at different times
1471,00:48:56.13,00:48:56.13,"has either changed your mind,"
1472,00:48:58.00,00:48:58.00,"offered to change your mind, or"
1473,00:48:59.97,00:48:59.97,considered changing your mind
1474,00:49:01.70,00:49:01.70,about who you were going to vote
1475,00:49:03.40,00:49:03.40,for.
1476,00:49:03.97,00:49:03.97,"The question now is, will Neleh"
1477,00:49:05.67,00:49:05.67,change her mind?
1478,00:49:06.57,00:49:06.57,It is time to vote.
1479,00:49:07.63,00:49:07.63,"Neleh, you're up."
1480,00:49:29.80,00:49:29.80,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the
1481,00:49:31.93,00:49:31.93,vote.
1482,00:49:48.77,00:49:48.77,"Once the vote is read, the"
1483,00:49:50.50,00:49:50.50,decision is final.
1484,00:49:51.67,00:49:51.67,The person will be asked to
1485,00:49:52.77,00:49:52.77,leave the Tribal Council area
1486,00:49:53.83,00:49:53.83,immediately.
1487,00:49:55.37,00:49:55.37,I'll read the vote.
1488,00:50:00.40,00:50:00.40,The 14th person voted out of the
1489,00:50:02.53,00:50:02.53,tribe...
1490,00:50:07.63,00:50:07.63,Kathy.
1491,00:50:08.53,00:50:08.53,">> Good luck, you guys."
1492,00:50:12.30,00:50:12.30,(sighs)

1495,00:50:24.87,00:50:24.87,">> All right, Jeff."
1496,00:50:26.30,00:50:26.30,Thank you.
1497,00:50:27.10,00:50:27.10,See you guys.
1498,00:50:28.33,00:50:28.33,>> PROBST: So long.
1499,00:50:42.27,00:50:42.27,Here's where we're at.
1500,00:50:44.33,00:50:44.33,You two have done what 14 others
1501,00:50:46.63,00:50:46.63,failed to do.
1502,00:50:48.20,00:50:48.20,You've gone as far as you can go
1503,00:50:50.10,00:50:50.10,in this game on your own power.
1504,00:50:52.50,00:50:52.50,This game now shifts from you to
1505,00:50:55.10,00:50:55.10,the seven members of the jury.
1506,00:50:57.27,00:50:57.27,Seven people who you had a hand
1507,00:50:59.07,00:50:59.07,in voting out will now have a
1508,00:51:01.23,00:51:01.23,hand in deciding which one of
1509,00:51:02.90,00:51:02.90,you two wins this thing.
1510,00:51:04.80,00:51:04.80,"You have one night left, one day"
1511,00:51:06.73,00:51:06.73,tomorrow.
1512,00:51:07.70,00:51:07.70,Drink it in.
1513,00:51:09.07,00:51:09.07,There's nothing left to do.
1514,00:51:10.73,00:51:10.73,"Take your torches, head back to"
1515,00:51:12.33,00:51:12.33,camp.
1516,00:51:13.40,00:51:13.40,I'll most definitely see you
1517,00:51:14.43,00:51:14.43,tomorrow.
1518,00:51:18.97,00:51:18.97,>> 16 total American strangers
1519,00:51:20.93,00:51:20.93,hit this island.
1520,00:51:21.97,00:51:21.97,"First thing off the bat, we're"
1521,00:51:23.97,00:51:23.97,working as a team.
1522,00:51:25.13,00:51:25.13,It was done with positive
1523,00:51:26.80,00:51:26.80,"attitudes, integrity..."
1524,00:51:28.43,00:51:28.43,"Honesty, uh, it might have been"
1525,00:51:30.33,00:51:30.33,a little shaky at times.
1526,00:51:31.80,00:51:31.80,It's the relationships and how
1527,00:51:33.63,00:51:33.63,you can improve upon them that
1528,00:51:35.50,00:51:35.50,I'm taking away.
1529,00:51:36.57,00:51:36.57,"But, uh, I loved it."
1530,00:51:53.30,00:51:53.30,>> Oh! I can't believe it. >> What?
1531,00:51:57.40,00:51:57.40,>> We're here.
1532,00:51:58.90,00:51:58.90,I can't believe I'm here.
1533,00:52:08.80,00:52:08.80,It'll catch any second.
1534,00:52:12.00,00:52:12.00,Yeah.
1535,00:52:12.83,00:52:12.83,>> There we go.
1536,00:52:14.07,00:52:14.07,>> All right.
1537,00:52:14.80,00:52:14.80,You know what? When V said I'll
1538,00:52:16.53,00:52:16.53,give you immunity and then you
1539,00:52:18.23,00:52:18.23,take me to the final two with
1540,00:52:19.90,00:52:19.90,"you, I was planning on bringing"
1541,00:52:21.63,00:52:21.63,V to the final two with me
1542,00:52:23.13,00:52:23.13,"anyways, and so it was like no"
1543,00:52:24.83,00:52:24.83,big deal.
1544,00:52:25.33,00:52:25.33,I know I'd have a better
1545,00:52:26.70,00:52:26.70,shot against V in the final two
1546,00:52:28.47,00:52:28.47,than I would Kathy.
1547,00:52:30.37,00:52:30.37,And whatever deal her and Kathy made was between her because I
1548,00:52:33.47,00:52:33.47,
1549,00:52:33.97,00:52:33.97,was not a part of that.
1550,00:52:35.30,00:52:35.30,And I felt good about it.
1551,00:52:37.40,00:52:37.40,>> All right.
1552,00:52:38.37,00:52:38.37,">> Oh, my heck, we got a fire,"
1553,00:52:40.60,00:52:40.60,girl.
1554,00:52:40.97,00:52:40.97,">> Yes, yes, yes."
1555,00:52:42.23,00:52:42.23,>> Last night together on this
1556,00:52:44.47,00:52:44.47,island.
1557,00:52:45.00,00:52:45.00,>> The reason why I offered
1558,00:52:47.03,00:52:47.03,Neleh the immunity was for
1559,00:52:48.97,00:52:48.97,several reasons.
1560,00:52:50.17,00:52:50.17,I took the risk because once
1561,00:52:52.27,00:52:52.27,"Kathy slipped, I knew that her"
1562,00:52:54.50,00:52:54.50,and I would probably be battling
1563,00:52:56.90,00:52:56.90,for a long time.
1564,00:52:58.80,00:52:58.80,">> Oh! >> Girl, you and I."
1565,00:53:00.93,00:53:00.93,
1566,00:53:01.57,00:53:01.57,>> Had to sit on the tiki thing
1567,00:53:03.50,00:53:03.50,for four hours.
1568,00:53:04.47,00:53:04.47,>> You and I.
1569,00:53:05.27,00:53:05.27,"$100,000, $1 million."
1570,00:53:06.57,00:53:06.57,">> Oh, my gosh."
1571,00:53:07.53,00:53:07.53,>> I was just assuming to make
1572,00:53:09.40,00:53:09.40,"it to the final two with Kathy,"
1573,00:53:11.33,00:53:11.33,because I know Kathy had some
1574,00:53:13.17,00:53:13.17,situations with some people in
1575,00:53:15.03,00:53:15.03,"her old tribe, but then when I"
1576,00:53:16.90,00:53:16.90,"turn it around, I also know that"
1577,00:53:18.93,00:53:18.93,there are a lot of people that
1578,00:53:20.80,00:53:20.80,felt that Neleh has been riding
1579,00:53:22.73,00:53:22.73,coattails and that she's not
1580,00:53:24.50,00:53:24.50,deserving of being in the
1581,00:53:26.07,00:53:26.07,position that she's in.
1582,00:53:27.27,00:53:27.27,"And looking at both scenarios, I"
1583,00:53:29.27,00:53:29.27,knew that my best shot was to
1584,00:53:31.10,00:53:31.10,make it to the final two with
1585,00:53:32.97,00:53:32.97,Neleh.
1586,00:53:33.33,00:53:33.33,"I wish you the best, sweetie."
1587,00:53:35.17,00:53:35.17,">> I wish you the best, too."
1588,00:53:36.97,00:53:36.97,>> I really do.
1589,00:53:37.90,00:53:37.90,"In every game, sometimes you"
1590,00:53:39.70,00:53:39.70,have to make a move that you
1591,00:53:41.47,00:53:41.47,really don't want to.
1592,00:53:42.80,00:53:42.80,But in order to keep the upper
1593,00:53:44.73,00:53:44.73,"hand, you may have to."
1594,00:53:46.13,00:53:46.13,"I myself, I think that's okay."
1595,00:53:48.03,00:53:48.03,I've asked the Lord for
1596,00:53:49.50,00:53:49.50,forgiveness.
1597,00:53:50.27,00:53:50.27,"So, being a Christian, we know"
1598,00:53:52.17,00:53:52.17,we have that ability to go to
1599,00:53:54.00,00:53:54.00,"our father and say, ""Lord, this"
1600,00:53:55.97,00:53:55.97,is what I did.
1601,00:53:56.87,00:53:56.87,I know you saw this.
1602,00:53:58.13,00:53:58.13,Please forgive me and I will go
1603,00:54:00.17,00:54:00.17,to my brother and ask him--
1604,00:54:01.90,00:54:01.90,after it's over with-- and ask
1605,00:54:03.80,00:54:03.80,"him for forgiveness, as well."""
1606,00:54:05.70,00:54:05.70,"Oh, let's say a pray for"
1607,00:54:07.23,00:54:07.23,Pappy real quick.
1608,00:54:07.77,00:54:07.77,">> Oh, yes."
1609,00:54:08.80,00:54:08.80,Our heavenly Father we are so
1610,00:54:10.07,00:54:10.07,grateful for this wonderful day
1611,00:54:11.57,00:54:11.57,and the opportunity that we've
1612,00:54:13.07,00:54:13.07,had.
1613,00:54:13.73,00:54:13.73,"As this night comes to a close,"
1614,00:54:15.20,00:54:15.20,"Heavenly Father, we ask that"
1615,00:54:16.53,00:54:16.53,Thou would please watch over and
1616,00:54:18.07,00:54:18.07,"protect our loved ones,"
1617,00:54:19.20,00:54:19.20,"especially Pappy at this time,"
1618,00:54:20.63,00:54:20.63,"as he is in the hospital, that"
1619,00:54:22.07,00:54:22.07,he may be able to get the
1620,00:54:23.27,00:54:23.27,strength and encouragement that
1621,00:54:24.77,00:54:24.77,he needs so that he may be
1622,00:54:26.00,00:54:26.00,good and strong.
1623,00:54:26.77,00:54:26.77,"If it be Thy will, that he"
1624,00:54:28.00,00:54:28.00,may be able to come to Council
1625,00:54:29.50,00:54:29.50,tomorrow.
1626,00:54:29.93,00:54:29.93,>> Amen.
1627,00:54:30.33,00:54:30.33,>> Thank you.
1628,00:54:31.33,00:54:31.33,"Okay, I'll see you later."
1629,00:54:32.97,00:54:32.97,">> Night, sweetie."
1630,00:54:34.17,00:54:34.17,">> Okay, have a good sleep."
1631,00:54:35.97,00:54:35.97,>> I shall.
1632,00:54:49.50,00:54:49.50,How are you this morning? >> Good. How are you?
1633,00:54:52.70,00:54:52.70,>> Wonderful.
1634,00:54:53.57,00:54:53.57,>> We're going to take a mud
1635,00:54:55.47,00:54:55.47,bath in the waterfall.
1636,00:54:57.47,00:54:57.47,>> Cool.
1637,00:54:58.80,00:54:58.80,"Go get us some apples and taro,"
1638,00:55:01.33,00:55:01.33,get some porridge.
1639,00:55:02.80,00:55:02.80,">> Oh, look at that huge pig."
1640,00:55:04.43,00:55:04.43,Look at that.
1641,00:55:05.17,00:55:05.17,We were just amazed that that
1642,00:55:06.83,00:55:06.83,cute little pig gravitated
1643,00:55:08.30,00:55:08.30,closer and closer to the
1644,00:55:09.67,00:55:09.67,homestead.
1645,00:55:10.23,00:55:10.23,Then we noticed a couple feet
1646,00:55:11.90,00:55:11.90,"from him, two or three chickens."
1647,00:55:13.73,00:55:13.73,We weren't even thinking about
1648,00:55:15.43,00:55:15.43,trying to run after them and try
1649,00:55:17.27,00:55:17.27,catch them.
1650,00:55:19.27,00:55:19.27,It was good to see the pig for
1651,00:55:21.10,00:55:21.10,"the last time, it was great to"
1652,00:55:22.93,00:55:22.93,see the chickens for the last
1653,00:55:24.70,00:55:24.70,time.
1654,00:55:25.00,00:55:25.00,And it was great to get up and
1655,00:55:26.87,00:55:26.87,cook popcorn for the last time.
1656,00:55:28.77,00:55:28.77,>> Mm-mm-mm.
1657,00:55:29.40,00:55:29.40,>> The popcorn of the Marquesas.
1658,00:55:31.13,00:55:31.13,">> I mean, I'm going to miss"
1659,00:55:32.67,00:55:32.67,this place.
1660,00:55:33.23,00:55:33.23,I'm going to miss the beach and
1661,00:55:34.93,00:55:34.93,the sand.
1662,00:55:35.40,00:55:35.40,"You know, I am going to miss the"
1663,00:55:37.13,00:55:37.13,"people that I, you know, became"
1664,00:55:38.90,00:55:38.90,really close to out here.
1665,00:55:42.20,00:55:42.20,Last mud bath together.
1666,00:55:56.27,00:55:56.27,"This place is beautiful, but being out here for 39 days, I'm"
1667,00:55:59.80,00:55:59.80,definitely ready to leave it all
1668,00:56:01.77,00:56:01.77,behind.
1669,00:56:04.53,00:56:04.53,Want to burn some stuff with me?
1670,00:56:06.30,00:56:06.30,>> Whose clothes are those?
1671,00:56:07.83,00:56:07.83,">> Oh, John's, Patricia's,"
1672,00:56:09.30,00:56:09.30,Pap's.
1673,00:56:09.60,00:56:09.60,"You know, just start up a little"
1674,00:56:11.27,00:56:11.27,bonfire and burn people's
1675,00:56:12.60,00:56:12.60,clothes that they didn't want
1676,00:56:14.13,00:56:14.13,anymore.
1677,00:56:14.53,00:56:14.53,It just felt good and helped to
1678,00:56:16.17,00:56:16.17,pass the time.
1679,00:56:16.90,00:56:16.90,I'm not returning to this beach
1680,00:56:18.53,00:56:18.53,tonight because everything is
1681,00:56:20.07,00:56:20.07,going to be burned up.
1682,00:56:21.20,00:56:21.20,Here go Pappy's pants that he
1683,00:56:22.73,00:56:22.73,hated.
1684,00:56:23.07,00:56:23.07,"Going to Tribal Council tonight,"
1685,00:56:24.73,00:56:24.73,it's a huge thing.
1686,00:56:25.67,00:56:25.67,The power is no longer within
1687,00:56:27.20,00:56:27.20,"us, you know, to be able to vote"
1688,00:56:28.90,00:56:28.90,each other off.
1689,00:56:29.67,00:56:29.67,The power is totally in the
1690,00:56:31.10,00:56:31.10,jury.
1691,00:56:31.37,00:56:31.37,They are the ones that are going
1692,00:56:33.03,00:56:33.03,to make the ultimate decision
1693,00:56:34.57,00:56:34.57,tonight in who wins a million
1694,00:56:36.10,00:56:36.10,dollars.
1695,00:56:36.77,00:56:36.77,>> Like Christ said when he was
1696,00:56:39.47,00:56:39.47,"hanging on the cross, ""It is"
1697,00:56:41.90,00:56:41.90,"finished."""
1698,00:56:42.77,00:56:42.77,It is almost done.
1699,00:56:44.33,00:56:44.33,I hope that the jury will look
1700,00:56:46.97,00:56:46.97,at the way I played this game as
1701,00:56:49.73,00:56:49.73,"very strategic, extremely"
1702,00:56:51.93,00:56:51.93,"deciseful, in some parts"
1703,00:56:53.43,00:56:53.43,"deceiving, but when you look at"
1704,00:56:55.37,00:56:55.37,"some of the deceptive parts,"
1705,00:56:57.13,00:56:57.13,they have put me in line to get
1706,00:56:59.10,00:56:59.10,"to where I am, and it was a"
1707,00:57:00.87,00:57:00.87,great strategy.
1708,00:57:02.10,00:57:02.10,>> I've been thinking about this
1709,00:57:04.77,00:57:04.77,"all day, you know, who is going"
1710,00:57:07.33,00:57:07.33,to vote for me tonight.
1711,00:57:09.27,00:57:09.27,And all I can do is just say
1712,00:57:10.70,00:57:10.70,"what I, you know, feel."
1713,00:57:11.87,00:57:11.87,I really feel like I have great
1714,00:57:13.47,00:57:13.47,relationships with everybody.
1715,00:57:14.93,00:57:14.93,I hope they'll look at me and
1716,00:57:16.43,00:57:16.43,know that I've been up-front and
1717,00:57:18.07,00:57:18.07,"honest, and hopefully that will"
1718,00:57:19.67,00:57:19.67,work towards my advantage.
1719,00:57:21.00,00:57:21.00,>> This may be the last time
1720,00:57:23.07,00:57:23.07,we'll be able to just look out
1721,00:57:25.33,00:57:25.33,and see the ocean like this from
1722,00:57:27.73,00:57:27.73,this view.
1723,00:57:30.17,00:57:30.17,"We both are ultimate survivors,"
1724,00:57:32.73,00:57:32.73,girl.
1725,00:57:33.17,00:57:33.17,">> Yeah, you know it."
1726,00:57:34.43,00:57:34.43,Here we are.
1727,00:57:35.17,00:57:35.17,>> That's right.
1728,00:57:36.13,00:57:36.13,>> We totally made it.
1729,00:57:37.47,00:57:37.47,I owe it all to the Lord and my
1730,00:57:39.33,00:57:39.33,family and everybody that's just
1731,00:57:41.27,00:57:41.27,kept me so strong out here.
1732,00:57:42.93,00:57:42.93,(laughing)
1733,00:58:15.53,00:58:15.53,>> I think this game was played
1734,00:58:17.67,00:58:17.67,differently.
1735,00:58:18.70,00:58:18.70,I think it was played honestly.
1736,00:58:20.80,00:58:20.80,I don't know what caused two
1737,00:58:22.97,00:58:22.97,Christian women to end up where
1738,00:58:24.33,00:58:24.33,they are.
1739,00:58:25.30,00:58:25.30,It could be faith.
1740,00:58:26.50,00:58:26.50,It could be a lot of things.
1741,00:58:28.03,00:58:28.03,I think it was probably as much
1742,00:58:31.40,00:58:31.40,a camaraderie in a game as I've
1743,00:58:32.60,00:58:32.60,ever noticed.
1744,00:58:34.10,00:58:34.10,An awful lot of it is luck.
1745,00:58:36.17,00:58:36.17,It's hard to make an argument
1746,00:58:37.43,00:58:37.43,that both of them didn't play
1747,00:58:38.77,00:58:38.77,"the game very well, because both"
1748,00:58:40.40,00:58:40.40,of them are right there at the
1749,00:58:41.40,00:58:41.40,end.
1750,00:58:44.80,00:58:44.80,">> Good-bye, stream."
1751,00:58:47.57,00:58:47.57,"Good-bye, coconuts."
1752,00:58:49.97,00:58:49.97,>> Last night I woke up and I
1753,00:58:51.80,00:58:51.80,felt I was in the jungle.
1754,00:58:53.43,00:58:53.43,I looked at the wall and the
1755,00:58:55.13,00:58:55.13,banyan trees and the vines
1756,00:58:56.53,00:58:56.53,were there.
1757,00:58:57.17,00:58:57.17,And I turned on the light and
1758,00:58:58.77,00:58:58.77,they were gone.
1759,00:58:59.57,00:58:59.57,"I am definitely detoxing, and"
1760,00:59:01.23,00:59:01.23,it's freaking me out.
1761,00:59:02.40,00:59:02.40,So when it comes to talking
1762,00:59:03.90,00:59:03.90,"about the vote right now, I"
1763,00:59:05.37,00:59:05.37,can't even process the game
1764,00:59:06.87,00:59:06.87,"right now, except for the fact"
1765,00:59:08.50,00:59:08.50,that I lost and I haven't
1766,00:59:09.90,00:59:09.90,focused on who I'm going to vote
1767,00:59:11.67,00:59:11.67,at the moment.
1768,00:59:15.70,00:59:15.70,">> Bye, chickens and crabs."
1769,00:59:22.77,00:59:22.77,>> To have an all-women's final
1770,00:59:24.70,00:59:24.70,is the best.
1771,00:59:26.37,00:59:26.37,Girls kick ass and I'm glad to
1772,00:59:28.10,00:59:28.10,see it.
1773,00:59:30.27,00:59:30.27,We had some strong men on the
1774,00:59:31.47,00:59:31.47,"team, but you know what?"
1775,00:59:32.60,00:59:32.60,I'd say the women kind of ruled
1776,00:59:34.73,00:59:34.73,the roost.
1777,00:59:36.57,00:59:36.57,I think V and Neleh are both
1778,00:59:38.37,00:59:38.37,well-deserved of the money.
1779,00:59:40.13,00:59:40.13,They both did a hell of a job.
1780,00:59:42.07,00:59:42.07,It is going to be a tough call
1781,00:59:44.03,00:59:44.03,tonight for me.
1782,00:59:50.27,00:59:50.27,">> Well, I can't tell you that I"
1783,00:59:52.57,00:59:52.57,feel good about seeing the two
1784,00:59:54.73,00:59:54.73,"women that are left in there,"
1785,00:59:56.83,00:59:56.83,and knowing that they got past
1786,00:59:59.00,00:59:59.00,"me, that they actually beat me."
1787,01:00:01.23,01:00:01.23,But I'm one of seven who have
1788,01:00:03.33,01:00:03.33,the power now.
1789,01:00:04.37,01:00:04.37,So I'm going to make a
1790,01:00:06.07,01:00:06.07,"decision who goes home $900,000"
1791,01:00:08.43,01:00:08.43,richer.
1792,01:00:09.33,01:00:09.33,That's kind of a little bit of a
1793,01:00:11.93,01:00:11.93,coup for myself.
1794,01:00:18.00,01:00:18.00,>> I hate when you're African-
1795,01:00:19.70,01:00:19.70,American and you talk about
1796,01:00:21.27,01:00:21.27,"race, people say this race card."
1797,01:00:23.10,01:00:23.10,Whoever wins this million is not
1798,01:00:24.97,01:00:24.97,going to be swayed by my
1799,01:00:26.33,01:00:26.33,preference for race.
1800,01:00:27.50,01:00:27.50,Because we are in a game and I
1801,01:00:29.20,01:00:29.20,"am a competitor, I think the"
1802,01:00:30.83,01:00:30.83,best person who played a good
1803,01:00:32.50,01:00:32.50,game should win.
1804,01:00:33.40,01:00:33.40,V has switched alliances on me.
1805,01:00:35.20,01:00:35.20,If I feel like she is being
1806,01:00:36.77,01:00:36.77,dishonest or if I feel like her
1807,01:00:38.53,01:00:38.53,"integrity is questionable, Neleh"
1808,01:00:40.40,01:00:40.40,may very well get my vote.
1809,01:00:48.97,01:00:48.97,>> There is a huge feeling of
1810,01:00:50.67,01:00:50.67,power being on the jury.
1811,01:00:52.10,01:00:52.10,And I didn't realize that until
1812,01:00:53.93,01:00:53.93,I became one of the jury members
1813,01:00:55.83,01:00:55.83,and had to accept the fact that
1814,01:00:57.70,01:00:57.70,I was out of the game and I was
1815,01:00:59.53,01:00:59.53,now on the jury.
1816,01:01:00.57,01:01:00.57,I don't think I want either of
1817,01:01:02.33,01:01:02.33,the two people that are left to
1818,01:01:04.17,01:01:04.17,have the million dollars.
1819,01:01:05.67,01:01:05.67,So I have a huge decision now.
1820,01:01:07.47,01:01:07.47,"Basically, I have to figure out"
1821,01:01:09.30,01:01:09.30,which one of them I think played
1822,01:01:11.20,01:01:11.20,the game the best and which one
1823,01:01:13.03,01:01:13.03,screwed me over less in the
1824,01:01:14.67,01:01:14.67,game.
1825,01:01:21.43,01:01:21.43,>> I don't know what to do.
1826,01:01:24.17,01:01:24.17,You got these Bible thumpers up
1827,01:01:25.60,01:01:25.60,"there, and you know, just"
1828,01:01:26.90,01:01:26.90,banging either The Book of
1829,01:01:28.30,01:01:28.30, Mormon or banging their Bibles
1830,01:01:29.93,01:01:29.93,and lying out of the sides of
1831,01:01:31.47,01:01:31.47,"their mouths, and now I have to"
1832,01:01:33.13,01:01:33.13,search within myself to figure
1833,01:01:34.70,01:01:34.70,out which one of these creeps I
1834,01:01:36.37,01:01:36.37,want to give a million dollars
1835,01:01:37.97,01:01:37.97,to.
1836,01:01:38.13,01:01:38.13,"I really want to go in and say,"
1837,01:01:40.20,01:01:40.20,"""Okay, the slate is clean."
1838,01:01:41.93,01:01:41.93,Your reaction to my statement
1839,01:01:43.87,01:01:43.87,will determine whether or not
1840,01:01:45.80,01:01:45.80,you get my vote.
1841,01:01:46.87,01:01:46.87,"If you answer honestly, you're"
1842,01:01:48.87,01:01:48.87,"repentant, then I will say okay."
1843,01:01:51.00,01:01:51.00,If you start lying right off the
1844,01:01:53.13,01:01:53.13,bat-- pfft!-- you're going to
1845,01:01:55.07,01:01:55.07,"lose my vote."""
1846,01:01:56.00,01:01:56.00,The power now is shifting back
1847,01:01:58.00,01:01:58.00,to the two of them.
1848,01:01:59.03,01:01:59.03,"And I'm saying, ""Let's see what"
1849,01:02:00.80,01:02:00.80,"you're going to do with it."""
1850,01:02:34.60,01:02:34.60,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in our jury.
1851,01:02:45.67,01:02:45.67,"As you can see, tonight we have"
1852,01:02:47.73,01:02:47.73,"our full jury of seven,"
1853,01:02:49.30,01:02:49.30,including Kathy who was voted
1854,01:02:51.27,01:02:51.27,out at the last Tribal Council.
1855,01:02:53.20,01:02:53.20,"And Paschal is back, who was"
1856,01:02:54.83,01:02:54.83,unable to make the last
1857,01:02:56.87,01:02:56.87,Tribal Council.
1858,01:02:57.30,01:02:57.30,He has been in very good hands
1859,01:02:59.03,01:02:59.03,throughout the night and day.
1860,01:03:00.80,01:03:00.80,He's been fully informed about
1861,01:03:02.53,01:03:02.53,"the last Tribal Council, he's"
1862,01:03:04.20,01:03:04.20,completely up to date and ready
1863,01:03:06.00,01:03:06.00,for tonight.
1864,01:03:06.67,01:03:06.67,"Okay, before we get to the main"
1865,01:03:08.47,01:03:08.47,"event, I want to find out how"
1866,01:03:10.13,01:03:10.13,"you guys spent your last day,"
1867,01:03:11.83,01:03:11.83,the 39th day.
1868,01:03:12.47,01:03:12.47,"Neleh, how was the day for you?"
1869,01:03:13.97,01:03:13.97,>> The day today has just been
1870,01:03:15.47,01:03:15.47,awesome.
1871,01:03:15.87,01:03:15.87,"You know, I slept in as long as"
1872,01:03:17.37,01:03:17.37,"I could, just because I knew the"
1873,01:03:18.97,01:03:18.97,day was going to go by so slow.
1874,01:03:20.47,01:03:20.47,I pretty much just kind of
1875,01:03:21.77,01:03:21.77,rested for about two or three
1876,01:03:23.20,01:03:23.20,"hours, I couldn't really sleep."
1877,01:03:24.73,01:03:24.73,It was more just kind of like in
1878,01:03:26.30,01:03:26.30,"a daze, just, you know, thinking"
1879,01:03:27.87,01:03:27.87,about the last 39 days out here
1880,01:03:29.40,01:03:29.40,and just the people I've met and
1881,01:03:30.97,01:03:30.97,just all the different
1882,01:03:32.07,01:03:32.07,encounters that I've had.
1883,01:03:33.30,01:03:33.30,"And then after that, I just got"
1884,01:03:34.80,01:03:34.80,this really big spurt of energy
1885,01:03:36.33,01:03:36.33,just out of nowhere and I just
1886,01:03:37.80,01:03:37.80,got up and just started burning
1887,01:03:39.33,01:03:39.33,everything.
1888,01:03:39.90,01:03:39.90,>> Burning everything.
1889,01:03:40.87,01:03:40.87,>> I pretty much just went to
1890,01:03:42.17,01:03:42.17,town.
1891,01:03:42.70,01:03:42.70,"I was a pyro today, you know,"
1892,01:03:43.90,01:03:43.90,putting soot and stuff on my
1893,01:03:45.07,01:03:45.07,"face, just burning everything"
1894,01:03:46.30,01:03:46.30,"that I could, so it was a nice"
1895,01:03:47.57,01:03:47.57,day.
1896,01:03:48.03,01:03:48.03,">> PROBST: Okay, you two have"
1897,01:03:49.83,01:03:49.83,come as far as you can.
1898,01:03:51.30,01:03:51.30,The focus now shifts to the
1899,01:03:53.00,01:03:53.00,seven members of the jury.
1900,01:03:54.63,01:03:54.63,It is one of the most unique
1901,01:03:56.40,01:03:56.40,aspects of this game.
1902,01:03:57.70,01:03:57.70,Seven people that you had a hand
1903,01:03:59.73,01:03:59.73,in voting out now get to decide
1904,01:04:01.77,01:04:01.77,your fate.
1905,01:04:02.77,01:04:02.77,You start this game with a clean
1906,01:04:04.63,01:04:04.63,"slate and over 39 days, you"
1907,01:04:06.20,01:04:06.20,build a history.
1908,01:04:07.13,01:04:07.13,Tonight that history is going to
1909,01:04:09.00,01:04:09.00,be evaluated and ultimately
1910,01:04:10.60,01:04:10.60,judged.
1911,01:04:11.20,01:04:11.20,"Your behavior, good or bad, as"
1912,01:04:12.93,01:04:12.93,well as how you respond to
1913,01:04:14.47,01:04:14.47,"tonight's Tribal Council, will"
1914,01:04:16.23,01:04:16.23,have a big impact on the final
1915,01:04:18.00,01:04:18.00,vote.
1916,01:04:18.23,01:04:18.23,Here's how it will work.
1917,01:04:19.53,01:04:19.53,We'll begin with an opening
1918,01:04:20.93,01:04:20.93,statement by each of you-- a

1920,01:04:24.13,01:04:24.13,explain why you think you're the
1921,01:04:25.83,01:04:25.83,most deserving person of the
1922,01:04:27.30,01:04:27.30,title Survivor and a million
1923,01:04:28.80,01:04:28.80,dollars.
1924,01:04:30.17,01:04:30.17,Then the jury gets a chance to
1925,01:04:32.63,01:04:32.63,address you.
1926,01:04:33.97,01:04:33.97,"They can make a comment, they"
1927,01:04:35.23,01:04:35.23,can ask a question.
1928,01:04:36.07,01:04:36.07,You'll then get a chance to make
1929,01:04:37.50,01:04:37.50,a closing statement addressing
1930,01:04:38.80,01:04:38.80,some of the things that have
1931,01:04:40.07,01:04:40.07,come up.
1932,01:04:40.50,01:04:40.50,Then we go to the vote.
1933,01:04:41.83,01:04:41.83,How you respond to these
1934,01:04:43.20,01:04:43.20,questions is very important.
1935,01:04:44.80,01:04:44.80,It's time to begin.
1936,01:04:45.90,01:04:45.90,"Neleh, opening statement to the"
1937,01:04:47.70,01:04:47.70,jury.
1938,01:04:48.30,01:04:48.30,">> Okay. Well, what I just want"
1939,01:04:49.83,01:04:49.83,to say to you guys is I've had
1940,01:04:51.33,01:04:51.33,the most incredible time out
1941,01:04:52.73,01:04:52.73,here.
1942,01:04:52.97,01:04:52.97,"You know, the last 39 days, I"
1943,01:04:54.50,01:04:54.50,honestly when I first came to
1944,01:04:56.00,01:04:56.00,"this island, I was like, oh, my"
1945,01:04:57.63,01:04:57.63,"heck, I don't have a chance to"
1946,01:04:59.20,01:04:59.20,be in the final end.
1947,01:05:00.30,01:05:00.30,"I mean, just that I was up"
1948,01:05:01.67,01:05:01.67,against such competitors and
1949,01:05:03.13,01:05:03.13,such strong-willed people.
1950,01:05:04.47,01:05:04.47,And there were times where
1951,01:05:05.83,01:05:05.83,literally you guys were just
1952,01:05:07.30,01:05:07.30,pulling me through the entire
1953,01:05:08.80,01:05:08.80,time.
1954,01:05:09.07,01:05:09.07,I wasn't the strongest person
1955,01:05:10.57,01:05:10.57,"but spiritually and mentally, I"
1956,01:05:12.20,01:05:12.20,"just tried to provide, you know,"
1957,01:05:13.87,01:05:13.87,"upliftment and you know, just"
1958,01:05:15.37,01:05:15.37,everything that I did for you
1959,01:05:16.90,01:05:16.90,"guys, I want you to know that I"
1960,01:05:18.50,01:05:18.50,did sincerely out of the love of
1961,01:05:20.20,01:05:20.20,my heart.
1962,01:05:20.63,01:05:20.63,"Just overall, I seriously want"
1963,01:05:22.17,01:05:22.17,you to know that I have given
1964,01:05:23.67,01:05:23.67,"everything 100% out here, and I"
1965,01:05:25.27,01:05:25.27,just love you guys
1966,01:05:26.17,01:05:26.17,"unconditionally, no matter what"
1967,01:05:27.77,01:05:27.77,your vote is tonight.
1968,01:05:28.83,01:05:28.83,I want you to know that
1969,01:05:30.00,01:05:30.00,"sincerely, from the bottom of my"
1970,01:05:31.67,01:05:31.67,heart.

1972,01:05:36.87,01:05:36.87,to win this?
1973,01:05:38.13,01:05:38.13,">> Well, guys, this has been a"
1974,01:05:39.83,01:05:39.83,wonderful ride for me.
1975,01:05:41.27,01:05:41.27,The vision was brought to me
1976,01:05:42.77,01:05:42.77,about four months ago.
1977,01:05:44.20,01:05:44.20,And just like the Scripture
1978,01:05:45.97,01:05:45.97,"says, that I write my vision"
1979,01:05:47.80,01:05:47.80,down and I make it plain on
1980,01:05:49.60,01:05:49.60,tablets and that I kept it
1981,01:05:51.30,01:05:51.30,before me each and every day.
1982,01:05:53.20,01:05:53.20,"From the day I came out here, I"
1983,01:05:55.23,01:05:55.23,made several things clear that I
1984,01:05:57.37,01:05:57.37,wanted to do.
1985,01:05:58.10,01:05:58.10,"The first thing, I wanted to"
1986,01:05:59.70,01:05:59.70,"have a strategy, and I saw that"
1987,01:06:01.57,01:06:01.57,strategy all the way to its
1988,01:06:03.13,01:06:03.13,completion.
1989,01:06:03.77,01:06:03.77,The second thing was I promised
1990,01:06:05.57,01:06:05.57,myself that I would develop
1991,01:06:07.10,01:06:07.10,relationships with every single
1992,01:06:08.90,01:06:08.90,"person, and I value each and"
1993,01:06:10.53,01:06:10.53,every one of you.
1994,01:06:11.47,01:06:11.47,And the third thing was that
1995,01:06:13.00,01:06:13.00,"when I came in here, I didn't"
1996,01:06:14.60,01:06:14.60,want to come in here and ride
1997,01:06:16.20,01:06:16.20,anybody's coattail.
1998,01:06:17.50,01:06:17.50,I wanted to prove myself with my
1999,01:06:19.73,01:06:19.73,"work ethics, with my"
2000,01:06:21.10,01:06:21.10,"spirituality, and with my... my"
2001,01:06:23.27,01:06:23.27,gumption to come out here and
2002,01:06:25.30,01:06:25.30,be the ultimate survivor.
2003,01:06:26.87,01:06:26.87,And I feel that I
2004,01:06:28.23,01:06:28.23,contributed wholeheartedly 100%
2005,01:06:30.20,01:06:30.20,"to everything I did, even when"
2006,01:06:32.07,01:06:32.07,people called me deceiving.
2007,01:06:33.77,01:06:33.77,I still were friends to all of
2008,01:06:35.67,01:06:35.67,"you, and I hope that you"
2009,01:06:37.17,01:06:37.17,remember that.
2010,01:06:38.07,01:06:38.07,But I put my faith in God
2011,01:06:39.63,01:06:39.63,knowing that you guys will all
2012,01:06:41.50,01:06:41.50,look at this objectively.
2013,01:06:43.10,01:06:43.10,"That's, that's all."
2014,01:06:44.20,01:06:44.20,And that's all I have to say.
2015,01:06:45.90,01:06:45.90,"And, um... God bless you all."
2016,01:06:47.63,01:06:47.63,">> PROBST: Okay, jury."
2017,01:06:48.93,01:06:48.93,I want you guys to take some
2018,01:06:50.57,01:06:50.57,time to think about what Neleh

2020,01:06:53.87,01:06:53.87,"moment, you are going to ask"
2021,01:06:55.33,01:06:55.33,each of them a question that
2022,01:06:56.80,01:06:56.80,will help you decide who will be
2023,01:06:58.50,01:06:58.50,the sole Survivor.
2024,01:07:20.37,01:07:20.37,>> PROBST: There's now a chance for the jury to address Neleh
2025,01:07:23.30,01:07:23.30,and V.
2026,01:07:23.90,01:07:23.90,You guys have a very big vote to

2028,01:07:26.23,01:07:26.23,This is a chance-- one last
2029,01:07:27.63,01:07:27.63,chance-- to elicit a little more

2031,01:07:30.93,01:07:30.93,the person who will win a
2032,01:07:32.43,01:07:32.43,million dollars and the title of
2033,01:07:34.10,01:07:34.10,sole Survivor.
2034,01:07:35.10,01:07:35.10,You can ask a question or make a
2035,01:07:37.40,01:07:37.40,statement.
2036,01:07:38.13,01:07:38.13,We'll begin with Tammy.
2037,01:07:43.63,01:07:43.63,>> I have always been up-front
2038,01:07:45.30,01:07:45.30,about the way that I was going
2039,01:07:47.00,01:07:47.00,to play this game.
2040,01:07:48.00,01:07:48.00,Said all along that I was going
2041,01:07:49.77,01:07:49.77,"to lie, I was going to cheat."
2042,01:07:51.40,01:07:51.40,I was going to do whatever it
2043,01:07:53.03,01:07:53.03,took to win this game.
2044,01:07:54.27,01:07:54.27,"But sometime during the game,"
2045,01:07:55.90,01:07:55.90,my strategy changed.
2046,01:07:57.03,01:07:57.03,I started feeling bad about the
2047,01:07:58.77,01:07:58.77,way I was playing the game and
2048,01:08:00.53,01:08:00.53,it was because of you two and
2049,01:08:02.17,01:08:02.17,"your holier than thou attitude,"
2050,01:08:03.90,01:08:03.90,"and ""I'm not going to lie, I'm"

2053,01:08:09.03,01:08:09.03,"play it with ethics, and morals"
2054,01:08:10.80,01:08:10.80,"and integrity."""
2055,01:08:11.63,01:08:11.63,"Well, you guys are hypocrites,"
2056,01:08:13.33,01:08:13.33,as far as I'm concerned.
2057,01:08:14.70,01:08:14.70,And you may have been the two
2058,01:08:16.33,01:08:16.33,biggest liars out on the island.
2059,01:08:18.17,01:08:18.17,While you're condemning Rob and
2060,01:08:19.90,01:08:19.90,John and Zoe and myself for
2061,01:08:21.43,01:08:21.43,manipulating and being
2062,01:08:22.70,01:08:22.70,"deceptive, you guys were doing"
2063,01:08:24.40,01:08:24.40,the exact same thing behind our
2064,01:08:26.13,01:08:26.13,"backs, but under the guise of"
2065,01:08:27.80,01:08:27.80,"Christianity and ""we're not"
2066,01:08:29.33,01:08:29.33,"going to lie."""
2067,01:08:30.33,01:08:30.33,"V, you flip-flopped so many"
2068,01:08:31.63,01:08:31.63,"times in this game, I don't even"
2069,01:08:33.17,01:08:33.17,think you knew which team you
2070,01:08:34.60,01:08:34.60,were playing on half the time.
2071,01:08:36.03,01:08:36.03,But you always made yourself
2072,01:08:37.40,01:08:37.40,"feel better, because after you"
2073,01:08:38.87,01:08:38.87,"lied to somebody, you always"
2074,01:08:40.20,01:08:40.20,went up and asked for their
2075,01:08:41.23,01:08:41.23,forgiveness.
2076,01:08:41.80,01:08:41.80,And then you asked God to
2077,01:08:43.03,01:08:43.03,forgive you for lying.
2078,01:08:44.10,01:08:44.10,"Neleh, you started this game out"
2079,01:08:45.63,01:08:45.63,as a 21-year-old Mormon woman
2080,01:08:47.07,01:08:47.07,who seemed to have a lot of
2081,01:08:48.37,01:08:48.37,self-respect.
2082,01:08:49.00,01:08:49.00,The one thing that you said you
2083,01:08:50.50,01:08:50.50,wanted from the beginning was to
2084,01:08:52.07,01:08:52.07,make it to the jury.
2085,01:08:53.27,01:08:53.27,"So Rob, John, Zoe and myself"
2086,01:08:54.97,01:08:54.97,offered you a chance to make it
2087,01:08:56.83,01:08:56.83,to the jury.
2088,01:08:57.53,01:08:57.53,"That sounded good to you, until"
2089,01:08:59.43,01:08:59.43,you got greedy and decided that
2090,01:09:01.37,01:09:01.37,being on the jury wasn't good
2091,01:09:03.13,01:09:03.13,enough.
2092,01:09:03.97,01:09:03.97,"So you lied to us, you stabbed"
2093,01:09:06.07,01:09:06.07,us in the back and you voted us
2094,01:09:08.27,01:09:08.27,off.
2095,01:09:10.20,01:09:10.20,This is the thing.
2096,01:09:11.83,01:09:11.83,I don't think either one of you
2097,01:09:13.40,01:09:13.40,deserve the million dollars.
2098,01:09:14.83,01:09:14.83,I think the person that deserves
2099,01:09:16.50,01:09:16.50,the million dollars is the woman
2100,01:09:18.13,01:09:18.13,"that you voted out yesterday,"
2101,01:09:19.60,01:09:19.60,right after you stabbed her in

2103,01:09:23.27,01:09:23.27,"But this is a game, and you guys"
2104,01:09:26.87,01:09:26.87,beat me at my own game.
2105,01:09:28.30,01:09:28.30,You lied better than I did.
2106,01:09:29.70,01:09:29.70,You manipulated better than I
2107,01:09:30.93,01:09:30.93,"did, and you deceived everybody"
2108,01:09:32.27,01:09:32.27,better than I did.
2109,01:09:33.37,01:09:33.37,So congratulations.

2117,01:09:52.03,01:09:52.03,"Both of y'all deserve this,"

2125,01:10:02.77,01:10:02.77,say you're contradictory.
2126,01:10:03.97,01:10:03.97,'Cause people do it all the time

2130,01:10:09.30,01:10:09.30,As I sit and look at you two
2131,01:10:10.67,01:10:10.67,"guys, I want you to directly"
2132,01:10:12.03,01:10:12.03,answer my question.
2133,01:10:13.77,01:10:13.77,Is there... some kind of moral
2134,01:10:16.53,01:10:16.53,message that you feel like
2135,01:10:18.97,01:10:18.97,you've gained from this game?
2136,01:10:21.23,01:10:21.23,">> Morally, there were times in"
2137,01:10:24.00,01:10:24.00,the game where I wanted to
2138,01:10:25.87,01:10:25.87,"follow my heart, but because of"
2139,01:10:27.47,01:10:27.47,the strong alliance that I had
2140,01:10:28.97,01:10:28.97,"made, I felt like I couldn't do"
2141,01:10:30.43,01:10:30.43,"that, and that is one thing"
2142,01:10:31.87,01:10:31.87,"morally that I've learned, is to"
2143,01:10:33.63,01:10:33.63,follow my heart from now on.

2145,01:10:36.43,01:10:36.43,>> And I would fall in line with
2146,01:10:37.87,01:10:37.87,the same thing.
2147,01:10:39.20,01:10:39.20,The lesson is that when I'm in a
2148,01:10:42.77,01:10:42.77,"situation, I will really think"
2149,01:10:44.70,01:10:44.70,it through before I give my word
2150,01:10:46.17,01:10:46.17,on something.
2151,01:10:47.30,01:10:47.30,Because sometimes I acted very
2152,01:10:49.83,01:10:49.83,quickly on making decisions and
2153,01:10:52.47,01:10:52.47,I would just give somebody the
2154,01:10:54.17,01:10:54.17,answer just to appease them.
2155,01:10:55.80,01:10:55.80,"So now, instead of just quickly"
2156,01:10:57.57,01:10:57.57,"giving people answers, I will"
2157,01:10:59.23,01:10:59.23,take the time to really think it
2158,01:11:01.13,01:11:01.13,"through and tell them, you know,"
2159,01:11:02.97,01:11:02.97,"either, ""I'll get back with you"""
2160,01:11:04.83,01:11:04.83,so that I know I'm not battling
2161,01:11:06.60,01:11:06.60,with my morals as opposed to
2162,01:11:08.23,01:11:08.23,giving somebody my word.

2175,01:11:32.23,01:11:32.23,this great country of ours has
2176,01:11:34.10,01:11:34.10,to offer.
2177,01:11:35.27,01:11:35.27,I am so proud of both of you.
2178,01:11:37.33,01:11:37.33,I would love to have had either
2179,01:11:39.60,01:11:39.60,one of you as my daughters.

2185,01:11:49.63,01:11:49.63,"and realize that, from this day"

2220,01:12:52.63,01:12:52.63,did in this game.
2221,01:12:53.50,01:12:53.50,>> I'm looking for specifics.
2222,01:12:54.97,01:12:54.97,Just one specific thing.

2232,01:13:13.93,01:13:13.93,But because of the alliance that
2233,01:13:15.30,01:13:15.30,"I made with the five of them, I"
2234,01:13:16.63,01:13:16.63,felt like I needed to stick to

2246,01:13:32.80,01:13:32.80,And I feel like I should be
2247,01:13:33.70,01:13:33.70,sitting up there in that seat.
2248,01:13:34.70,01:13:34.70,I feel I worked really hard out
2249,01:13:35.77,01:13:35.77,there.
2250,01:13:36.73,01:13:36.73,I played hard with the people

2252,01:13:41.33,01:13:41.33,going to talk about lies and

2266,01:14:18.37,01:14:18.37,for Neleh.
2267,01:14:19.03,01:14:19.03,"I was just curious, at what"
2268,01:14:20.90,01:14:20.90,point in the game do you feel
2269,01:14:22.93,01:14:22.93,that you did your most dramatic
2270,01:14:25.07,01:14:25.07,"strategic movement, and what the"
2271,01:14:27.27,01:14:27.27,decision was and when and the
2272,01:14:29.30,01:14:29.30,decision that you made by
2273,01:14:31.03,01:14:31.03,yourself.

2275,01:14:34.70,01:14:34.70,actually I started playing the
2276,01:14:36.77,01:14:36.77,game was day 24.
2277,01:14:37.90,01:14:37.90,"You know, Paschal and I"
2278,01:14:39.13,01:14:39.13,both talked about this together.
2279,01:14:40.90,01:14:40.90,It was one of those things
2280,01:14:42.33,01:14:42.33,"where, you know, Sean had"
2281,01:14:43.70,01:14:43.70,approached us earlier saying the
2282,01:14:45.47,01:14:45.47,"four of them are in an alliance,"
2283,01:14:47.20,01:14:47.20,"you know, we can switch this"
2284,01:14:48.77,01:14:48.77,game around at this point.
2285,01:14:50.17,01:14:50.17,"Up until that time, I mean, I"
2286,01:14:51.77,01:14:51.77,was seriously 100% going with
2287,01:14:53.37,01:14:53.37,Rotu and just hoping that in the
2288,01:14:55.13,01:14:55.13,"end, out of the six of us, maybe"
2289,01:14:56.87,01:14:56.87,"something would change, because,"
2290,01:14:58.63,01:14:58.63,"you know, there was the four of"
2291,01:15:00.40,01:15:00.40,them and the two of us.
2292,01:15:01.67,01:15:01.67,But when it got down to the
2293,01:15:03.13,01:15:03.13,"nitty gritty, that is when, you"
2294,01:15:04.83,01:15:04.83,"know, we made the biggest"
2295,01:15:06.23,01:15:06.23,strategic move.
2296,01:15:07.03,01:15:07.03,And that was the five of us
2297,01:15:08.53,01:15:08.53,against the four of them.
2298,01:15:09.90,01:15:09.90,"And that, it's... you know, I've"
2299,01:15:11.67,01:15:11.67,been saying that all along.
2300,01:15:13.17,01:15:13.17,That's when I started playing
2301,01:15:14.73,01:15:14.73,the game was day 24.
2302,01:15:15.87,01:15:15.87,">> And then V, um, one time you"
2303,01:15:17.87,01:15:17.87,did tell me your strategy and
2304,01:15:19.73,01:15:19.73,the strategy was that you were
2305,01:15:21.67,01:15:21.67,going to wait to be approached
2306,01:15:23.60,01:15:23.60,"by people for alliances,"
2307,01:15:25.17,01:15:25.17,"strategy, that you were never"
2308,01:15:27.03,01:15:27.03,going to set forth and do it on
2309,01:15:29.07,01:15:29.07,your own.
2310,01:15:29.60,01:15:29.60,"The question is, how can you go"
2311,01:15:31.43,01:15:31.43,"through the game, you know,"
2312,01:15:33.03,01:15:33.03,adjusting with all these
2313,01:15:34.47,01:15:34.47,alliances and not feel part of
2314,01:15:36.27,01:15:36.27,the devious behavior?
2315,01:15:37.53,01:15:37.53,That was my question.
2316,01:15:38.67,01:15:38.67,">> My strategy, yes, was for me"
2317,01:15:40.40,01:15:40.40,to wait for people to approach
2318,01:15:42.13,01:15:42.13,me.
2319,01:15:43.47,01:15:43.47,Now if I felt that there was a
2320,01:15:45.40,01:15:45.40,strategic move being worked that
2321,01:15:47.47,01:15:47.47,"I can weasel my way in there, I"
2322,01:15:49.50,01:15:49.50,would take the initiative and
2323,01:15:51.40,01:15:51.40,ask.
2324,01:15:52.37,01:15:52.37,Everyone is constantly changing
2325,01:15:54.70,01:15:54.70,"their game plan, and you're out"
2326,01:15:57.07,01:15:57.07,"here to outwit, outplay,"
2327,01:15:58.90,01:15:58.90,outlast.
2328,01:15:59.27,01:15:59.27,"Outwit may be, immediately I"
2329,01:16:00.63,01:16:00.63,need to make a change.
2330,01:16:01.67,01:16:01.67,"So, that's what it was."
2331,01:16:03.60,01:16:03.60,It's like when you wanted to
2332,01:16:04.83,01:16:04.83,line up with me and said don't
2333,01:16:06.17,01:16:06.17,"oust me, you weren't even a"
2334,01:16:07.37,01:16:07.37,person I was going to even get
2335,01:16:08.73,01:16:08.73,rid of.
2336,01:16:09.03,01:16:09.03,I had Neleh in mind.
2337,01:16:09.93,01:16:09.93,>> That's okay. You...

2355,01:16:41.00,01:16:41.00,It's important to me.
2356,01:16:42.13,01:16:42.13,Integrity is important to me.
2357,01:16:43.67,01:16:43.67,"You both lied, okay?"
2358,01:16:45.67,01:16:45.67,"Cut to the chase, you're not"
2359,01:16:47.70,01:16:47.70,"innocent, you're not naive."
2360,01:16:49.70,01:16:49.70,"You both did it, so take a deep"
2361,01:16:52.03,01:16:52.03,breath and clear it.
2362,01:16:53.53,01:16:53.53,Everybody knows it.
2363,01:16:54.97,01:16:54.97,"So I want to know now, right"
2364,01:16:57.10,01:16:57.10,"now, why the hell should I give"
2365,01:16:59.47,01:16:59.47,you my vote?
2366,01:17:01.33,01:17:01.33,"Plain and simple, and knowing"

2370,01:17:08.00,01:17:08.00,Why should I give you my vote?

2375,01:17:15.87,01:17:15.87,Um... the reason why you should
2376,01:17:18.30,01:17:18.30,"give me your vote, John, is"
2377,01:17:20.40,01:17:20.40,"because truly, honestly, I was"
2378,01:17:22.77,01:17:22.77,going to join your guys'

2381,01:17:29.30,01:17:29.30,would change around and I would
2382,01:17:31.73,01:17:31.73,be able to be more than fifth
2383,01:17:34.03,01:17:34.03,place.
2384,01:17:34.97,01:17:34.97,As soon as I found out that was
2385,01:17:37.17,01:17:37.17,"not going to happen, that is"
2386,01:17:39.20,01:17:39.20,when I decided to not do that
2387,01:17:41.30,01:17:41.30,"anymore, and that's my answer."
2388,01:17:43.47,01:17:43.47,Is that what you're looking for?
2389,01:17:45.80,01:17:45.80,>> Yeah.
2390,01:17:47.00,01:17:47.00,>> PROBST: Vecepia?
2391,01:17:48.33,01:17:48.33,>> The reason why I think that

2397,01:17:57.13,01:17:57.13,"a strategy, playing the game all"
2398,01:17:58.97,01:17:58.97,the way to the hilt-- whether it
2399,01:18:00.87,01:18:00.87,deceived you or deceived anybody
2400,01:18:02.73,01:18:02.73,else-- I played the game to the
2401,01:18:04.50,01:18:04.50,fullest to get me to where I am.
2402,01:18:06.37,01:18:06.37,Did I answer your question?
2403,01:18:08.03,01:18:08.03,">> Yes, you did."

2427,01:19:17.13,01:19:17.13,I felt that some people just
2428,01:19:18.87,01:19:18.87,"made comments, and I wanted to"
2429,01:19:20.73,01:19:20.73,have questions so that you guys

2435,01:19:30.77,01:19:30.77,But just make sure that whatever

2549,01:29:45.20,01:29:45.20,for this final vote to play out
2550,01:29:46.57,01:29:46.57,than right here in Central Park
2551,01:29:47.93,01:29:47.93,in New York City.

2553,01:29:50.40,01:29:50.40,We're going to get to them.
2554,01:29:52.93,01:29:52.93,"But first, it's been five months"
2555,01:29:55.33,01:29:55.33,since we finished this.
2556,01:29:57.07,01:29:57.07,Five months since these votes
2557,01:29:59.27,01:29:59.27,were cast.
2558,01:30:00.40,01:30:00.40,Nothing you two are going to say
2559,01:30:01.63,01:30:01.63,tonight is going to change these
2560,01:30:02.87,01:30:02.87,votes.
2561,01:30:03.90,01:30:03.90,Outcome already determined.
2562,01:30:05.47,01:30:05.47,Just not yet revealed.
2563,01:30:06.77,01:30:06.77,"So with that in mind, as you"
2564,01:30:08.43,01:30:08.43,guys watched this play out over
2565,01:30:10.27,01:30:10.27,"the last 13 weeks on television,"
2566,01:30:12.13,01:30:12.13,I'm imagining a lot of what you
2567,01:30:13.97,01:30:13.97,heard or said was said about
2568,01:30:15.63,01:30:15.63,"you, you're hearing for the"
2569,01:30:17.23,01:30:17.23,first time because you are not
2570,01:30:19.00,01:30:19.00,always privy to the interviews
2571,01:30:20.77,01:30:20.77,or what happens behind your back
2572,01:30:22.67,01:30:22.67,or at the other camp.
2573,01:30:24.60,01:30:24.60,"So my question, Vecepia, I'll start with you, is did you hear"
2574,01:30:27.13,01:30:27.13,
2575,01:30:27.77,01:30:27.77,anything when you watched it at
2576,01:30:29.43,01:30:29.43,"home when you said ""Wow, that"
2577,01:30:31.00,01:30:31.00,surprises me that people would
2578,01:30:32.60,01:30:32.60,say that about me or think that
2579,01:30:34.27,01:30:34.27,"about me""?"
2580,01:30:34.83,01:30:34.83,">> I was surprised about, one of"
2581,01:30:36.40,01:30:36.40,the biggest things is
2582,01:30:37.43,01:30:37.43,perception.
2583,01:30:38.13,01:30:38.13,Perception regarding myself and
2584,01:30:39.63,01:30:39.63,"Sean, how people thought that an"
2585,01:30:41.20,01:30:41.20,alliance was the same as having
2586,01:30:42.70,01:30:42.70,a relationship or a bond.
2587,01:30:43.93,01:30:43.93,Now we're going to have bonds.
2588,01:30:45.40,01:30:45.40,We're going to have a Christian
2589,01:30:46.93,01:30:46.93,"bond, we're gonna have a bond"
2590,01:30:48.33,01:30:48.33,"that we're African-American,"
2591,01:30:49.70,01:30:49.70,that we came from the same tribe
2592,01:30:51.27,01:30:51.27,originally and went all the way
2593,01:30:52.80,01:30:52.80,together and then also just
2594,01:30:54.10,01:30:54.10,because we have some social
2595,01:30:55.43,01:30:55.43,identities that we can relate to
2596,01:30:57.00,01:30:57.00,"like the fact that, you know, we"
2597,01:30:58.57,01:30:58.57,know the brothers and sisters
2598,01:30:59.97,01:30:59.97,is chillin' at the barber shop
2599,01:31:01.53,01:31:01.53,and they're talking about us.
2600,01:31:03.43,01:31:03.43,That is an honorable thing. But a lot of people thought that
2601,01:31:05.83,01:31:05.83,
2602,01:31:06.30,01:31:06.30,that was an alliance.
2603,01:31:07.30,01:31:07.30,So people felt that we had an
2604,01:31:08.67,01:31:08.67,alliance and it was the same as
2605,01:31:10.13,01:31:10.13,"a bond, and it wasn't."
2606,01:31:11.20,01:31:11.20,So it really surprised me to
2607,01:31:12.50,01:31:12.50,hear some of the things people
2608,01:31:13.93,01:31:13.93,said regarding that.
2609,01:31:14.87,01:31:14.87,">> PROBST: How about you, Neleh,"
2610,01:31:16.40,01:31:16.40,did you hear anything about
2611,01:31:17.67,01:31:17.67,"yourself and thought, ""Never"
2612,01:31:19.00,01:31:19.00,knew people thought that about
2613,01:31:20.43,01:31:20.43,"me""?"
2614,01:31:20.97,01:31:20.97,">> Well, I thought it was kind"
2615,01:31:22.23,01:31:22.23,"of funny-- you know, I came out"
2616,01:31:23.70,01:31:23.70,"here, you know, we all basically"
2617,01:31:25.23,01:31:25.23,"came out here, obviously-- to"
2618,01:31:26.63,01:31:26.63,play the game for a million
2619,01:31:27.93,01:31:27.93,dollars.
2620,01:31:28.33,01:31:28.33,I didn't have to really start
2621,01:31:29.70,01:31:29.70,getting in and digging my feet
2622,01:31:31.13,01:31:31.13,"in until day 24, because I"
2623,01:31:32.40,01:31:32.40,wasn't really a target.
2624,01:31:33.50,01:31:33.50,"You know, I came out there right"
2625,01:31:35.03,01:31:35.03,"away, you know, me and Paschal"
2626,01:31:36.47,01:31:36.47,"were kind of like, you know, oh,"
2627,01:31:38.00,01:31:38.00,they can't carry us as much.
2628,01:31:39.37,01:31:39.37,We were kind of treated a little
2629,01:31:40.90,01:31:40.90,bit that way.
2630,01:31:41.50,01:31:41.50,So it was... It was different
2631,01:31:42.90,01:31:42.90,"for me, I guess, to see people"
2632,01:31:44.33,01:31:44.33,kind of put me in like this
2633,01:31:45.63,01:31:45.63,sweetheart role and then also
2634,01:31:47.03,01:31:47.03,put me in this competitive
2635,01:31:48.53,01:31:48.53,role.
2636,01:31:48.97,01:31:48.97,And people couldn't like put the
2637,01:31:50.70,01:31:50.70,two together.
2638,01:31:51.43,01:31:51.43,"They're like, she's either"
2639,01:31:53.03,01:31:53.03,sweet or she's competitive.
2640,01:31:54.60,01:31:54.60,If she's sweet... or if she's
2641,01:31:56.37,01:31:56.37,"really competitive, then the"
2642,01:31:58.00,01:31:58.00,sweetness must be a cover-up.
2643,01:31:59.70,01:31:59.70,"So, that was pretty different"
2644,01:32:01.50,01:32:01.50,for me.
2645,01:32:02.67,01:32:02.67,">> PROBST: Well, there's no"
2646,01:32:04.20,01:32:04.20,"arguing, I think Sean said it,"
2647,01:32:05.90,01:32:05.90,you two played better than the
2648,01:32:07.63,01:32:07.63,"other 14, no matter what they"
2649,01:32:09.27,01:32:09.27,may try to tell you later or
2650,01:32:10.87,01:32:10.87,argue otherwise.
2651,01:32:11.80,01:32:11.80,You're sitting here.
2652,01:32:12.93,01:32:12.93,They aren't.
2653,01:32:13.67,01:32:13.67,"We're gonna find out now, of the"
2654,01:32:15.37,01:32:15.37,"two of you, who played the best."
2655,01:32:17.10,01:32:17.10,I want to poll the jury.
2656,01:32:18.40,01:32:18.40,Has anybody talked about their
2657,01:32:20.03,01:32:20.03,vote with anybody else?
