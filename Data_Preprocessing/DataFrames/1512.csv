464,00:31:08.42,00:31:08.42,The only thing that would be asurprise is if Amanda would
465,00:31:10.50,00:31:10.50,"turn.But she won't, because she knows"

477,00:31:53.25,00:31:53.25,too.>> The hard part for me is that
478,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,"nobody here trusts Todd.It irks me, because I've thrown"
479,00:32:01.46,00:32:01.46,"his name out, and it's like,""Okay, well, if you don't trust"

485,00:32:58.38,00:32:58.38,it's highly likely she'll end upin fourth place.

487,00:33:04.92,00:33:04.92,suddenly her chances of gettingto top three are much better.
