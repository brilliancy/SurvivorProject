24,00:01:22.38,00:01:22.38,Six are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
25,00:01:33.17,00:01:33.17,>> I think that was the most shocking tribal council yet.
26,00:01:36.04,00:01:36.04,I think that Jean-Robert got a big kick out of James getting

48,00:02:37.12,00:02:37.12,absolutely gives me hope. There must be a crack old tribal
49,00:02:40.42,00:02:40.42,"lines somewhere, because Erik and I are still around."
50,00:02:44.04,00:02:44.04,">> Peeg, you and your Buddha outfit."

53,00:02:54.67,00:02:54.67,"council, which would be kind of interesting."
54,00:02:57.04,00:02:57.04,I'm not giving up until I'm voted out.
55,00:02:59.12,00:02:59.12,"You know, I love it that I'm still here."

192,00:11:59.25,00:11:59.25,Yeah! >> PROBST: Take off your
193,00:12:02.25,00:12:02.25,blindfolds. It's over.
194,00:12:05.54,00:12:05.54,"All right, Denise and Robert. Here's what's going to happen--"
195,00:12:07.12,00:12:07.12,you're going to go out on a boat.
196,00:12:09.04,00:12:09.04,You're going to have a nice meal.
197,00:12:10.67,00:12:10.67,"I'm going to turn this Sprint phone on right now, because"
198,00:12:12.58,00:12:12.58,you're going to get a phone call.
199,00:12:14.58,00:12:14.58,"Keep this phone turned on. In addition, you're going to"
200,00:12:17.83,00:12:17.83,choose two survivors to come along with you and bring their
201,00:12:21.29,00:12:21.29,loved ones. Who's the first survivor that
202,00:12:25.29,00:12:25.29,you're going to bring along with their loved one?
203,00:12:28.33,00:12:28.33,">> Todd. >> PROBST: Todd and his sister,"
204,00:12:32.79,00:12:32.79,"Brandy, are going with you. Denise, you look pained to have"
205,00:12:37.12,00:12:37.12,to make another decision. >> This is a very tough decision
206,00:12:41.04,00:12:41.04,"for me, Jeff. I'm sorry, I'm going to have to"
207,00:12:45.08,00:12:45.08,go with Amanda. >> PROBST: Amanda and her sister
208,00:12:47.88,00:12:47.88,going on the reward. >> Thank you!
209,00:12:52.17,00:12:52.17,"Thank you so much. >> PROBST: All right, the good"
210,00:12:57.08,00:12:57.08,part of the reward is over. Now comes the tough part.
211,00:13:00.83,00:13:00.83,Time for you guys to say good- bye to your loved ones.
212,00:13:03.21,00:13:03.21,>> Good-bye. >> Thanks for coming.
213,00:13:06.67,00:13:06.67,">> Okay. >> PROBST: All right, Lawrence."
214,00:13:19.62,00:13:19.62,">> PROBST: All right, Erik, Peih-Gee, Courtney, grab your"
215,00:13:24.17,00:13:24.17,"stuff, head back to camp. >> Have fun, guys."
216,00:13:28.54,00:13:28.54,">> PROBST: Okay, there is one more element to this reward."
217,00:13:33.54,00:13:33.54,"When the afternoon is over, the loved ones are going to spend"
218,00:13:37.00,00:13:37.00,the night at your camp. They're going to get a chance to
219,00:13:42.04,00:13:42.04,experience what you've been living for 31 days.
220,00:13:45.42,00:13:45.42,Boat's waiting for you. Have fun.
221,00:14:01.04,00:14:01.04,">> Oh, my god, there's ribs. Oh, look at the chicken."
222,00:14:04.58,00:14:04.58,There's pizza. >> There's pizza?
223,00:14:07.00,00:14:07.00,"Are you serious? >> Guys, dig in."
224,00:14:09.42,00:14:09.42,">> We have been eating off the ground, literally."
225,00:14:12.83,00:14:12.83,>> Rip it apart. >> You have never seen me eat
226,00:14:15.42,00:14:15.42,"like this, have you? >> Oh, my god."
227,00:14:18.25,00:14:18.25,">> How is it, honey? Just for my husband to be here"
228,00:14:20.04,00:14:20.04,"in China... he's afraid to fly. Just for him to come here, that"
229,00:14:22.71,00:14:22.71,means a lot to me. But to come here and compete and
230,00:14:26.29,00:14:26.29,"to win a challenge together, it's so uplifting."
231,00:14:29.92,00:14:29.92,I've been taken over the top. >> Ah!
232,00:14:33.04,00:14:33.04,"Oh, my god! >> Oh, look at that!"
233,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,>> That's Todd's piece right there.
234,00:14:43.25,00:14:43.25,">> Do you want some? >> Oh, hell, yeah, baby."
235,00:14:51.46,00:14:51.46,>> This is best chocolate cake I have ever had in my life.
236,00:14:54.08,00:14:54.08,( phone ringing ) >> Your phone's ringing.
237,00:14:56.46,00:14:56.46,">> There's my call, hon. >> There they are, look!"
238,00:15:00.25,00:15:00.25,>> Say hello. >> Hello?
239,00:15:02.42,00:15:02.42,>> Hi. >> All of a sudden I can hear
240,00:15:05.12,00:15:05.12,"people crying in the background. And it's my oldest daughter,"
241,00:15:08.67,00:15:08.67,Erin. >> Don't cry.
242,00:15:11.33,00:15:11.33,You've got to talk to me. How did you guys do in the
243,00:15:17.33,00:15:17.33,tournament? All right!
244,00:15:22.12,00:15:22.12,Daddy's here with me. >> And I smell so bad.
245,00:15:28.79,00:15:28.79,>> Can you smell me from there? >> Smell-a-vision.
246,00:15:38.04,00:15:38.04,">> I'm smiling just thinking about you, sweet pea."
247,00:15:40.75,00:15:40.75,"I think about you every day. No, don't cry."
248,00:15:46.12,00:15:46.12,"I miss you so much. >> I love you, too."
249,00:15:55.33,00:15:55.33,"You have a good night, okay? And I'll see you really, really"
250,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,soon. >> I love you.
251,00:16:01.17,00:16:01.17,"Good night, baby. Being able to hear their voices"
252,00:16:08.62,00:16:08.62,"and have my husband here with me today, it gives me the strength,"
253,00:16:11.46,00:16:11.46,"definitely, to keep on going, and, I mean, I'm here to the"
254,00:16:14.08,00:16:14.08,end. I'm going to grab strength from
255,00:16:16.58,00:16:16.58,them and embrace it and just keep on going.
256,00:16:28.04,00:16:28.04,>> I wonder why Denise picked Amanda.
257,00:16:30.08,00:16:30.08,"I'll be honest, I'm kind of pissed that she didn't pick me,"
258,00:16:31.88,00:16:31.88,because I took her off on a fat reward.
259,00:16:35.25,00:16:35.25,>> I've got to get this off my chest-- I do not believe Todd's
260,00:16:38.25,00:16:38.25,story. >> I could not believe that
261,00:16:41.33,00:16:41.33,"he... like, ""Oh, my sister had an unplanned teenage pregnancy,"
262,00:16:45.25,00:16:45.25,"and then a convenient miscarriage."""
263,00:16:48.62,00:16:48.62,Gee whiz. You think the girl might not
264,00:16:50.58,00:16:50.58,want the entire world to know about that.
265,00:16:53.08,00:16:53.08,">> Like, if it's true, my deepest condolences to his"
266,00:16:56.12,00:16:56.12,family. >> I thought the same thing.
267,00:16:58.12,00:16:58.12,"I was like, ""Oh, how convenient."""
268,00:17:00.50,00:17:00.50,And then he was the first one picked by Denise.
269,00:17:02.62,00:17:02.62,Right. Todd was going for the Oscar
270,00:17:05.17,00:17:05.17,"with his performance of ""My sister had a convenient"
271,00:17:08.71,00:17:08.71,"miscarriage."" And then of course Jeff was"
272,00:17:11.04,00:17:11.04,"like, ""Todd, it looks like you just got some bad news."
273,00:17:14.42,00:17:14.42,"What happened?"" And Todd's like ""My sister."
274,00:17:21.71,00:17:21.71,She was pregnant and she... she lost the baby.
275,00:17:27.25,00:17:27.25,"But it happened for a reason."" Like, that is not, like the fake"
276,00:17:30.21,00:17:30.21,"Johnny Fair Play, ""My grandma died."""
277,00:17:32.75,00:17:32.75,You can almost forgive that. That's funny.
278,00:17:58.12,00:17:58.12,>> What is that? >> Shut up!
279,00:18:08.12,00:18:08.12,">> Indulge, kids! Indulge!"
280,00:18:14.17,00:18:14.17,>> Kinky! >> When the loved ones showed
281,00:18:18.62,00:18:18.62,"up, you know, we were sourpusses."
282,00:18:20.42,00:18:20.42,"We were pissed that we lost the challenge, pissed we didn't get"
283,00:18:22.38,00:18:22.38,to go. I really didn't feel like
284,00:18:24.54,00:18:24.54,interacting with anybody. >> I'm so bad with names.
285,00:18:27.08,00:18:27.08,Mr. Denise... >> It's Robert.
286,00:18:29.54,00:18:29.54,>> So how proud are you of Denise?
287,00:18:33.25,00:18:33.25,">> Very, very proud. >> It was really tough."
288,00:18:36.25,00:18:36.25,"And especially for me. Like, I picked Denise to go with"
289,00:18:38.04,00:18:38.04,"me on a literally once-in-a- lifetime reward trip, and, you"
290,00:18:41.75,00:18:41.75,"know, she didn't pick me. And it sucks."
291,00:18:51.83,00:18:51.83,">> Amanda, how perfect it is that we..."
292,00:18:54.54,00:18:54.54,>> I know! >> I can't believe it.
293,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,">> Really, we're just so lucky that Denise got to pick two"
294,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,"people and she chose us. >> Oh, my gosh!"
295,00:19:03.38,00:19:03.38,>> So surreal. >> And the other thing that
296,00:19:06.42,00:19:06.42,"scared me was when I whispered about Kim, you know, I was like,"
297,00:19:09.33,00:19:09.33,"""They're going to think I'm lying, like I'm pulling a big"
298,00:19:12.12,00:19:12.12,"lie to see my sister."" Hopefully everybody believes it"
299,00:19:15.17,00:19:15.17,because it wasn't a lie. >> I'm so sorry about that.
300,00:19:18.42,00:19:18.42,">> You know, I know there's been a lot of pointing at me as to a"
301,00:19:21.25,00:19:21.25,"strategic threat, but it was all true."
302,00:19:24.79,00:19:24.79,"It was all from the heart, you know?"
303,00:19:26.92,00:19:26.92,I wasn't out to be some snake right there.
304,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,I really was concerned about my home.
305,00:19:32.08,00:19:32.08,>> How pregnant was she? >> She was about two months.
306,00:19:34.67,00:19:34.67,">> Three months now. >> She lost it a while ago,"
307,00:19:38.00,00:19:38.00,Todd. >> Did she?
308,00:19:39.58,00:19:39.58,">> Yeah. >> Like, right after I left?"
309,00:19:41.25,00:19:41.25,>> Pretty much. >> Seems like you're getting
310,00:19:45.96,00:19:45.96,"along all right. >> Yeah, know, everybody seems"
311,00:19:47.79,00:19:47.79,"to be okay. You know, I mean, like I said,"
312,00:19:49.54,00:19:49.54,"there's a lot of young kids here, and I don't have a lot in"
313,00:19:52.25,00:19:52.25,common with them. But we'll see what happens.
314,00:19:54.08,00:19:54.08,"I mean, I can only hope that Amanda and Todd stay with me,"
315,00:19:56.04,00:19:56.04,and we go to the final three. If they backstab me and take
316,00:20:00.08,00:20:00.08,"Courtney, that's one of the chances I'm going to have to"
317,00:20:02.42,00:20:02.42,"take. But, I mean, to be out here all"
318,00:20:06.04,00:20:06.04,this time is still pretty damn good.
319,00:20:07.96,00:20:07.96,">> Yeah. Play your game, that's all."
320,00:20:09.79,00:20:09.79,Do what you... do what you think is right.
321,00:20:12.58,00:20:12.58,">> I mean, obviously, it's not a good idea for us to backstab"
322,00:20:14.96,00:20:14.96,"anyone anymore, but I think as long as we take Denise to the"
323,00:20:18.21,00:20:18.21,final four she'll understand. >> Would you vote out Denise
324,00:20:21.71,00:20:21.71,"before Courtney, or no? >> Yeah."
325,00:20:23.96,00:20:23.96,>> Because we can win better... >> She works hard all week.
326,00:20:26.12,00:20:26.12,"I mean, she has kids. >> I freaking love Denise."
327,00:20:29.54,00:20:29.54,"I do. >> The thing is, in the final"
328,00:20:32.04,00:20:32.04,"three, she will play her sob story."
329,00:20:34.21,00:20:34.21,">> That's right. We... like, Amanda, and I and"
330,00:20:37.50,00:20:37.50,"Courtney are all pretty much on the same level, because we've"
331,00:20:41.21,00:20:41.21,pissed a lot of the people on the jury off.
332,00:20:43.08,00:20:43.08,"And so, like, it's a pretty even chance between all of us."
333,00:20:45.12,00:20:45.12,So I'm like... >> And we would make such a cute
334,00:20:47.17,00:20:47.17,"final three. >> Oh, you guys can do this."
335,00:20:51.25,00:20:51.25,>> Yeah. >> You got it.
336,00:20:53.50,00:20:53.50,>> Perfect. >> It's like a dream.
337,00:20:56.12,00:20:56.12,>> Perfect. >> I know you'll do good.
338,00:21:23.71,00:21:23.71,>> I'm going to do my best. >> Easily into the one or two
339,00:21:26.75,00:21:26.75,spot. You know what you're doing.
340,00:21:34.42,00:21:34.42,>> Mm-hmm. >> I love you.
341,00:21:37.62,00:21:37.62,"My god, you smell bad. >> I know."
342,00:21:40.17,00:21:40.17,I'm so sorry. I stink.
343,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,">> I've got to smell just as bad, though."
344,00:21:44.21,00:21:44.21,">> You're getting there, honey. You're fitting right in with"
345,00:21:45.83,00:21:45.83,"this group, I tell you. >> 32 days."
346,00:21:55.12,00:21:55.12,"I can make it a few more. Tell everyone I miss them, okay?"
347,00:22:04.21,00:22:04.21,">> I love you. >> See you in a few days, okay?"
348,00:22:14.88,00:22:14.88,">> It kills you to say good-bye to loved ones, but you can't"
349,00:22:17.46,00:22:17.46,"stop the game, because the game keeps going."
350,00:22:21.08,00:22:21.08,"So you want to feel comfortable, and you want to feel like you"
351,00:22:23.33,00:22:23.33,"can trust people, and you just can't, though."
352,00:22:27.29,00:22:27.29,You've got to keep on your toes. You've got to keep yourself
353,00:22:29.75,00:22:29.75,"nervous, or else you're going to get screwed."
354,00:22:48.71,00:22:48.71,">> No, I know. I could see it, you know."
355,00:22:57.08,00:22:57.08,"It wasn't my fault. You know, it just happened to"
356,00:22:58.96,00:22:58.96,work out that way. I don't want to be the next one
357,00:23:01.12,00:23:01.12,"to go. >> After the loved ones left,"
358,00:23:03.33,00:23:03.33,Denise came over and tried to kind of fix that little
359,00:23:06.21,00:23:06.21,"problem that she might have with me, like, not getting picked."
360,00:23:28.21,00:23:28.21,>> I do feel a little better that at least she took the time
361,00:23:30.12,00:23:30.12,to come talk to me. I might need her vote if I can
362,00:23:33.17,00:23:33.17,convince her to try to vote somebody else off.
363,00:23:43.25,00:23:43.25,">> I mean, I just wanted to see where you're standing, and I"
364,00:23:45.33,00:23:45.33,"wanted you to see where I'm coming from, you know what I"
365,00:23:47.29,00:23:47.29,mean? >> Right now I'm going to
366,00:23:49.38,00:23:49.38,concentrate on gathering up all my energy and focus on winning
367,00:23:51.62,00:23:51.62,"that challenge, because I really need it."
368,00:23:53.71,00:23:53.71,"Every time since the merge, I feel like I need to win."
369,00:24:05.08,00:24:05.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's"
370,00:24:15.46,00:24:15.46,immunity challenge? >> Yes.
371,00:24:17.42,00:24:17.42,">> PROBST: First things first. Erik, give it up."
372,00:24:28.83,00:24:28.83,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
373,00:24:32.25,00:24:32.25,"You are going to have to dig deep, as today's challenge will"
374,00:24:35.00,00:24:35.00,test you both physically and mentally.

381,00:25:01.00,00:25:01.00,Next to each statement is a key. Choose the statement you think

391,00:25:40.08,00:25:40.08,Go! You are attached to a rope that
392,00:25:42.79,00:25:42.79,runs the length of this course. Erik flies over.
393,00:25:47.08,00:25:47.08,Amanda's over. Todd making quick work of it.
394,00:25:51.79,00:25:51.79,Denise is over. Todd and Amanda making their way
395,00:25:54.17,00:25:54.17,through the swamp. Peih-Gee's right there.
396,00:25:57.96,00:25:57.96,Todd first up the mountain. Amanda right behind.
397,00:26:01.12,00:26:01.12,Erik snagged on one of the posts.
398,00:26:04.04,00:26:04.04,It's Todd and Amanda in the lead.
399,00:26:14.88,00:26:14.88,Todd and Amanda both untying their first box.
400,00:26:17.25,00:26:17.25,"There are two statements. One is true, one is false."
401,00:26:19.83,00:26:19.83,Todd has his first key. Amanda has her first key.
402,00:26:32.04,00:26:32.04,Peih-Gee's made her first choice.
403,00:26:34.54,00:26:34.54,Todd going to pass Erik as he heads to the start.
404,00:26:37.29,00:26:37.29,Amanda heading back to the start with her first key.
405,00:26:40.25,00:26:40.25,Peih-Gee heading back into the swamp with her first key.
406,00:26:42.79,00:26:42.79,Big question for Todd-- did he choose the true statement?
407,00:26:45.83,00:26:45.83,Will the key open a lock? And it does.
408,00:26:50.25,00:26:50.25,Todd has his first lock open. Todd and Amanda both have one
409,00:26:55.54,00:26:55.54,lock undone. Two locks left.

412,00:27:04.67,00:27:04.67,Amanda right behind. Peih-Gee back with her first
413,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,key. Peih-Gee has her first lock
414,00:27:12.50,00:27:12.50,open. She's heading back for her
415,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,"second. Todd, Amanda, Peih-Gee, all have"
416,00:27:16.38,00:27:16.38,one lock open. Denise and Erik struggling to
417,00:27:19.08,00:27:19.08,stay in it. Todd at his second box.
418,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,Amanda at her second box. Choose the one you think is true
419,00:27:28.54,00:27:28.54,and grab the key. Amanda and Todd both with their
420,00:27:32.08,00:27:32.08,second keys. Erik trying to stay in this
421,00:27:36.04,00:27:36.04,challenge for immunity. First lock doesn't open.
422,00:27:41.38,00:27:41.38,Second lock doesn't open. Third lock doesn't open.
423,00:27:47.12,00:27:47.12,Erik now in dead last. Todd and Amanda neck and neck as
424,00:27:51.04,00:27:51.04,they head back into the swamp. Peih-Gee heading back with her
425,00:27:56.96,00:27:56.96,second key. Todd opens his second lock.
426,00:28:01.58,00:28:01.58,Todd has only one lock left. Amanda trying her key in the
427,00:28:04.75,00:28:04.75,first lock. It does not work.
428,00:28:08.42,00:28:08.42,Trying it in the remaining lock. It does not work.
429,00:28:12.25,00:28:12.25,This gives Todd a huge lead. Peih-Gee back with her second
430,00:28:16.42,00:28:16.42,key. Did she choose right?
431,00:28:19.58,00:28:19.58,She did. It's Peih-Gee and Todd with two
432,00:28:21.83,00:28:21.83,"locks open, one lock left. Amanda still fighting, hoping"
433,00:28:25.12,00:28:25.12,Todd will make a mistake. Peih-Gee right on Todd's tail.
434,00:28:29.08,00:28:29.08,Todd has two statements left. If he chooses the true statement
435,00:28:35.12,00:28:35.12,he'll have his third and final key.
436,00:28:37.62,00:28:37.62,"Todd has made his choice. The question is, did he choose"
437,00:28:40.29,00:28:40.29,the right statement? Peih-Gee now opening her third
438,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,box. You want a guarantee you go
439,00:28:45.25,00:28:45.25,"final five, you keep fighting. Peih-Gee has made her choice."
440,00:28:52.83,00:28:52.83,Todd and Peih-Gee both have their third keys.
441,00:28:55.38,00:28:55.38,"With that third key in hand, if he is right, Todd wins immunity."
442,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,"If he's wrong, it oppose the door for Peih-Gee."
443,00:29:08.17,00:29:08.17,It does not open. It's taken every bit of strength
444,00:29:12.58,00:29:12.58,Peih-Gee has left to get back with that third key.
445,00:29:16.62,00:29:16.62,"If she's right, it was worth it. If she answered correctly, she"
446,00:29:21.50,00:29:21.50,will open the lock. She does.
447,00:29:29.21,00:29:29.21,"And with that, Peih-Gee wins immunity!"
448,00:29:41.08,00:29:41.08,"Peih-Gee, come on over. >> I never would have believed"
449,00:29:44.17,00:29:44.17,"it. >> PROBST: For the second time,"
450,00:29:46.71,00:29:46.71,Peih-Gee wins individual immunity.
451,00:29:52.62,00:29:52.62,"You are safe tonight at tribal council, guaranteed a spot in"
452,00:29:54.75,00:29:54.75,"the final five. Denise, Todd, Courtney, Amanda,"
453,00:29:58.08,00:29:58.08,"Erik, after 33 days, this game will come to an end for one of"
454,00:30:01.50,00:30:01.50,you. See you tonight at tribal
455,00:30:03.46,00:30:03.46,council. Head on back to camp.
456,00:30:23.79,00:30:23.79,">> You know, honestly, like, I can't believe I won."
457,00:30:25.96,00:30:25.96,I'm still crying about it. Wow.
458,00:30:29.17,00:30:29.17,"I've been, like, underdog this whole time I've been here."
459,00:30:33.12,00:30:33.12,"Every council that I'm not wearing the necklace, I expect"
460,00:30:35.71,00:30:35.71,"to be voted out, you know, so... >> Erik, come to the table."
461,00:30:40.00,00:30:40.00,"The muddy rice is ready. >> This is probably one of, like"
462,00:30:44.71,00:30:44.71,"my proudest moments, like, I've ever had in my entire life."
463,00:30:46.75,00:30:46.75,"I'm safe tonight, but it's been, like, really mentally and"
464,00:30:50.46,00:30:50.46,physically exhausting. >> I'm okay.
465,00:31:08.42,00:31:08.42,The only thing that would be a surprise is if Amanda would
466,00:31:10.50,00:31:10.50,"turn. But she won't, because she knows"
467,00:31:13.04,00:31:13.04,"if Erik or Peih-Gee get even close to the end, they've got"
468,00:31:16.42,00:31:16.42,it. So...
469,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,"It seemed so obvious to me, at least, when Peih-Gee won"
470,00:31:24.33,00:31:24.33,"immunity, who else is going to go tonight?"
471,00:31:27.04,00:31:27.04,Erik. It's probably the easiest vote
472,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,"for me so far. >> I feel like, even if I were"
473,00:31:33.04,00:31:33.04,"on Todd's side, I would feel a little shaded out, just by not"
474,00:31:37.00,00:31:37.00,"trusting him with, like, that... what I think is false"
475,00:31:43.17,00:31:43.17,"information about his sister. >> He could very well have,"
476,00:31:48.21,00:31:48.21,"like, played that up as, you know, a way to get further in"
477,00:31:50.71,00:31:50.71,"the game. It's what it sounded like to me,"
478,00:31:53.25,00:31:53.25,too. >> The hard part for me is that
479,00:31:56.96,00:31:56.96,"nobody here trusts Todd. It irks me, because I've thrown"
480,00:32:01.46,00:32:01.46,"his name out, and it's like, ""Okay, well, if you don't trust"
481,00:32:04.38,00:32:04.38,"him, then what's the deal?"" I feel like I have to fight."
482,00:32:08.33,00:32:08.33,But I don't know what to do. >> Thanks.
483,00:32:20.71,00:32:20.71,">> I'll talk to Denise. >> My plan for tonight, is Erik"
484,00:32:24.42,00:32:24.42,"and I are going to vote for Todd, and hope that Denise"
485,00:32:27.25,00:32:27.25,"swings for a tie. >> If she votes Erik out now,"
486,00:32:58.38,00:32:58.38,it's highly likely she'll end up in fourth place.
487,00:33:01.08,00:33:01.08,"If she tries to force a tie and Todd gets voted out tonight,"
488,00:33:04.92,00:33:04.92,suddenly her chances of getting to top three are much better.
489,00:33:39.75,00:33:39.75,">> I will. Denise isn't stupid, though."
490,00:33:44.21,00:33:44.21,>> This tribal council right here is definitely a turning
491,00:33:46.21,00:33:46.21,point in the game. If I do switch and head to that
492,00:33:50.62,00:33:50.62,"side of the coin, are my chances better?"
493,00:33:53.50,00:33:53.50,Probably. But am I going to win against
494,00:33:56.00,00:33:56.00,one of those two? I don't know.
495,00:33:58.00,00:33:58.00,"I mean, it's just... right now it's, like, a 50-50 split."
496,00:34:21.29,00:34:21.29,">> Oh, that cold wind. I hate that cold wind."
497,00:34:23.29,00:34:23.29,That means it's about to start in my...
498,00:34:34.08,00:34:34.08,">> I trust you, I do. >> I'm definitely the swing vote"
499,00:34:37.79,00:34:37.79,"tonight. For me, personally, I mean, this"
500,00:34:40.08,00:34:40.08,"is do or die. When I get up there, I mean, I"
501,00:34:42.58,00:34:42.58,don't know right now who I'm going to pick.
502,00:34:44.96,00:34:44.96,What happens when I come back to camp after I make this decision?
503,00:34:48.21,00:34:48.21,Who's going to be flipping out? This is a game for a million

507,00:35:02.29,00:35:02.29,I'm a little scared. I'm a little in turmoil.
508,00:35:05.08,00:35:05.08,I'm a little flipping out. Thunder and lightning is getting
509,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,"closer, the decision's getting closer, my mind is racing."
510,00:35:11.88,00:35:11.88,This is just insane. I don't know.
511,00:35:14.88,00:35:14.88,I just don't know what to do. Can you help me?

517,00:36:02.75,00:36:02.75,did you feel like you knew Denise in a different way?

536,00:36:59.79,00:36:59.79,Do you think there is a strong consensus of what's going to

538,00:37:05.42,00:37:05.42,>> I think there's definitely some ambiguity going on.
539,00:37:10.33,00:37:10.33,"You know, if you want to look at it as us being two against four,"
540,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,one person is at the very bottom.
541,00:37:15.71,00:37:15.71,"And I don't see why they would make that leap and be like, ""I"

543,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,"It could turn the game around entirely for one or two people,"

593,00:41:34.12,00:41:34.12,with me simply because I think I can beat them or do I take with
594,00:41:38.04,00:41:38.04,me somebody I think is most deserving because I showed I
