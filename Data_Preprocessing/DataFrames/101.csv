99,00:05:28.73,00:05:28.73,We got oars. We got buckets.
100,00:05:30.70,00:05:30.70, We're set for months.
101,00:05:32.63,00:05:32.63," Hey, who knows, we could make   a mud house with it."
102,00:05:35.87,00:05:35.87,"You know, that could be like rebar."

105,00:05:41.87,00:05:41.87, dragging them behind the raft
106,00:05:44.73,00:05:44.73,   and that is dumb.
107,00:05:46.27,00:05:46.27,"I said,  ""Let's get them boxes aboard."
108,00:05:48.33,00:05:48.33,"It'll be a lot easier."""
109,00:05:49.87,00:05:49.87,"   You know,   ""That's deadweight you got."""
110,00:05:51.83,00:05:51.83, KELLY:   He was yelling at everybody
111,00:05:54.07,00:05:54.07," ""Let's lose the box!"

114,00:06:00.17,00:06:00.17, but that doesn't mean that this is his world.
115,00:06:02.83,00:06:02.83,"RICHARD: Rudy, Sean, Stacey, Sue, can we take 15 minutes"
116,00:06:05.93,00:06:05.93,and just talk before we do anything?
117,00:06:08.27,00:06:08.27,Sure.
118,00:06:09.53,00:06:09.53,Can we piss first?
119,00:06:10.90,00:06:10.90,Just a suggestion.
120,00:06:19.37,00:06:19.37,Should we take a break?
121,00:06:20.87,00:06:20.87,"No, keep paddling!"
122,00:06:22.20,00:06:22.20,One break at a time!
123,00:06:24.17,00:06:24.17,   One water break at a time.
124,00:06:26.20,00:06:26.20,We want to get closer to the island
125,00:06:28.13,00:06:28.13,before we turn up.
126,00:06:29.20,00:06:29.20,"I'll distill you all the water you want,"
127,00:06:31.03,00:06:31.03,just get me to the island.
128,00:06:32.63,00:06:32.63,"   You guys, we are so close."
129,00:06:34.80,00:06:34.80,"Keep going, we're there."
130,00:06:36.53,00:06:36.53,   ( retching noise )
131,00:06:38.27,00:06:38.27,You all right?
132,00:06:40.53,00:06:40.53,"  We're almost there,  Roe, hang in."
133,00:06:42.30,00:06:42.30,Okay.
134,00:06:43.30,00:06:43.30,Got it going right over here.
135,00:06:44.97,00:06:44.97, Straight ahead of us.
136,00:06:44.97,00:06:44.97,Where'd he point?
137,00:06:46.53,00:06:46.53,Right there. Straight up there.
138,00:06:53.27,00:06:53.27,Whoo! And we're all here.
139,00:06:55.63,00:06:55.63,Let's go.
140,00:06:59.27,00:06:59.27, Yeah!
141,00:07:00.90,00:07:00.90,   Whoo-hoo!
142,00:07:03.53,00:07:03.53,This is what I was talking about!
143,00:07:07.63,00:07:07.63,"Ramona, how you doing, honey?"
144,00:07:11.43,00:07:11.43,RAMONA: I don't like being on the water  all that much.
145,00:07:17.27,00:07:17.27,"  So, I mean, the whole motion    like this,"
146,00:07:19.90,00:07:19.90,"   and we're rowing,"
147,00:07:21.33,00:07:21.33,"  and we have like 100 pounds  of stuff on the raft,"
148,00:07:24.07,00:07:24.07,"   I just, I started heaving."
149,00:07:26.30,00:07:26.30,Good job. Good job.
150,00:07:28.27,00:07:28.27,"RAMONA:   I'm used to being in a lab   with my lab coat on,"
151,00:07:31.80,00:07:31.80,  in the air-conditioning.
152,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,"  But this is, like, outdoors,  24-7,"
153,00:07:37.53,00:07:37.53,"  and you're exerting energy,  like, almost all of that time."
154,00:07:43.53,00:07:43.53,"  Oh, my God."
155,00:07:45.90,00:07:45.90, This is just Day One.
156,00:07:53.47,00:07:53.47,"Should we, uh, you know,  talk for a little bit,"
157,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17,   or should we start moving    stuff up?
158,00:07:57.90,00:07:57.90,"Hey, let's discuss some things,   man."
159,00:07:59.27,00:07:59.27, Let's figure some things out.
160,00:08:00.63,00:08:00.63,Here's what we plan on doing.
161,00:08:02.20,00:08:02.20,"High tide is that line right there, see that line?"
162,00:08:04.13,00:08:04.13,"Yeah, uh-huh."
163,00:08:05.13,00:08:05.13,So it shouldn't come up to here.
164,00:08:06.90,00:08:06.90,"   And this piece of    bamboo back here,"
165,00:08:08.20,00:08:08.20,"  we can lay it from up here,  over to there,"
166,00:08:10.13,00:08:10.13,  and that'll be the beginning of our shelter.
167,00:08:12.30,00:08:12.30,"Actually, before we build a shelter,"
168,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,just knock that whole branch off.
169,00:08:15.70,00:08:15.70,"No, I mean, this is an awesome spot."
170,00:08:17.53,00:08:17.53,I'm just saying...
171,00:08:18.80,00:08:18.80,What's the first thing we need to do?
172,00:08:20.77,00:08:20.77,Shelter.
173,00:08:20.77,00:08:20.77,We need a latrine.
174,00:08:22.23,00:08:22.23,"Okay, so we don't need fire tonight?"
175,00:08:24.17,00:08:24.17,That's an option.
176,00:08:25.50,00:08:25.50,We got enough water to make it tonight.
177,00:08:27.27,00:08:27.27,"You guys, I think first thing we ought to do"
178,00:08:29.47,00:08:29.47,is talk about how we're going to do
179,00:08:31.47,00:08:31.47,whatever we're going to do--
180,00:08:33.07,00:08:33.07,talk about the process.
181,00:08:34.47,00:08:34.47,"Listen, listen."
182,00:08:35.80,00:08:35.80,Let me give you a rough quick.
183,00:08:37.37,00:08:37.37,The camp will be right there.
184,00:08:38.93,00:08:38.93, We'll clear these leaves off.
185,00:08:40.27,00:08:40.27, That's a flat piece of ground.
186,00:08:41.67,00:08:41.67,The latrine will be down there.
187,00:08:43.20,00:08:43.20, The wind's hitting me  in the back right now.
188,00:08:45.27,00:08:45.27,"SEAN: So, we're saying we need a latrine"
189,00:08:47.50,00:08:47.50,"and a clear place to sleep, is that all?"
190,00:08:49.43,00:08:49.43,Food.
191,00:08:50.77,00:08:50.77,And if we need more...
192,00:08:52.37,00:08:52.37,"Let's check the box, before we make any decisions."
193,00:08:54.33,00:08:54.33,Let's see what we got.
194,00:08:55.53,00:08:55.53,There might be a blowtorch in there.
195,00:08:58.33,00:08:58.33,We need a bathroom.
196,00:08:59.47,00:08:59.47,Are you guys all done talking?
197,00:09:01.33,00:09:01.33,Huh?
198,00:09:02.60,00:09:02.60,I don't know.
199,00:09:04.63,00:09:04.63,I'm done.
200,00:09:05.70,00:09:05.70,I'm going to open up a box.
201,00:09:06.83,00:09:06.83,I'm looking for Fritos.
202,00:09:08.47,00:09:08.47," DIRK:  Rich, um, I appreciate  what he's trying to do"
203,00:09:10.70,00:09:10.70,"  as far as bring the team    together and stuff,"
204,00:09:12.63,00:09:12.63,'cause that's one thing  that needs to happen.
205,00:09:14.63,00:09:14.63,   I think he's got some good   skills in that area.
206,00:09:16.63,00:09:16.63,"  And, unfortunately,    people like that annoy me."
207,00:09:18.43,00:09:18.43,"I'm just thinking,"
208,00:09:19.83,00:09:19.83,I think we're off to a bad start.
209,00:09:21.47,00:09:21.47,"Why, 'cause we're not talking?"
210,00:09:23.10,00:09:23.10,Yeah.
211,00:09:24.10,00:09:24.10,"Sometimes, though, Richard, um,"
212,00:09:26.17,00:09:26.17,you kind of got to do things
213,00:09:27.97,00:09:27.97,"and talk as you go along,"
214,00:09:29.53,00:09:29.53,and sometimes things can't be that planned out.
215,00:09:32.73,00:09:32.73,I agree with you.
216,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,"The problem with having no conversation whatsoever,"
217,00:09:36.70,00:09:36.70,or lots of people talking about different things
218,00:09:39.17,00:09:39.17,is that nobody's working toward a particular goal.
219,00:09:41.83,00:09:41.83," Not the silly   little stuff about,"
220,00:09:43.43,00:09:43.43,"oh, who's going to sleep where?"
221,00:09:45.17,00:09:45.17,  What are we   going to do?
222,00:09:46.23,00:09:46.23,  But why are we here?
223,00:09:47.23,00:09:47.23, And what's the point?
224,00:09:48.50,00:09:48.50,   And if we don't...
225,00:09:49.63,00:09:49.63,"Oh, I figured that out before I come here."
226,00:09:52.13,00:09:52.13,For you...
227,00:09:52.13,00:09:52.13,And you haven't?
228,00:09:53.87,00:09:53.87,"And I have for me,"
229,00:09:55.30,00:09:55.30,but we haven't for us.
230,00:09:56.70,00:09:56.70,"And for the next seven ejections,"
231,00:09:58.57,00:09:58.57,"21 days, we have  to function together,"
232,00:10:00.77,00:10:00.77,  or we fail.
233,00:10:01.97,00:10:01.97,What do you think we're doing now?
234,00:10:03.70,00:10:03.70,Not functioning together at all.
235,00:10:05.20,00:10:05.20,"I'm a redneck, and I don't know corporate world at all,"
236,00:10:07.80,00:10:07.80,  and corporate world    ain't gonna work out here
237,00:10:09.70,00:10:09.70,  in the bush.
238,00:10:10.90,00:10:10.90,"No, I'm not talking corporate world."
239,00:10:12.60,00:10:12.60,I'm talking creating a team.
240,00:10:14.00,00:10:14.00, I thought we were doing good.
241,00:10:15.47,00:10:15.47,"   But, see, creating a team"
242,00:10:16.93,00:10:16.93,  is actually putting   all of our hands together...
243,00:10:19.73,00:10:19.73,"  Not hands, all of us knowing    what we're doing."
244,00:10:21.57,00:10:21.57,"Yeah, the hand thing, yeah, but that's..."
245,00:10:23.23,00:10:23.23," Action, man. Action, Richard."
246,00:10:24.97,00:10:24.97,Action.
247,00:10:26.43,00:10:26.43,"  Well, you don't want  to act ahead."
248,00:10:29.17,00:10:29.17,RICHARD:  I'm good to go survivalwise.
249,00:10:32.57,00:10:32.57," Peoplewise, it'll be    a little more challenging."
250,00:10:35.07,00:10:35.07,But I've got the million dollar  check written already.
251,00:10:38.00,00:10:38.00," I mean, I'm the winner."
252,00:10:39.57,00:10:39.57,  And it's that kind of cocky   attitude that makes people
253,00:10:42.20,00:10:42.20, really hate your guts.
254,00:10:43.77,00:10:43.77,"  So that's the kind of thing,  I've really got to keep, uh..."
255,00:10:46.93,00:10:46.93,  under wraps.
256,00:10:48.53,00:10:48.53,"  But, uh, it's just,   how do I get there from here?"
257,00:11:02.03,00:11:02.03,What's that?
258,00:11:03.13,00:11:03.13,"Whoa! Look at this, folks."
259,00:11:05.03,00:11:05.03,"If this is kerosene, and we didn't take one of those lamps..."
260,00:11:08.90,00:11:08.90,We can make torches and stuff out of twine.
261,00:11:11.13,00:11:11.13,We could twine all the rafts together.
262,00:11:13.03,00:11:13.03,JOEL: What is that?
263,00:11:14.07,00:11:14.07,Biscuits.
264,00:11:15.13,00:11:15.13,"Yeah, it's definitely biscuits,"
265,00:11:16.70,00:11:16.70,'cause we got corn...
266,00:11:18.00,00:11:18.00,"Well, look, we got a frying pan."
267,00:11:19.47,00:11:19.47,"Oh, we are so set."
268,00:11:20.50,00:11:20.50,"Look, I'm shaking it."
269,00:11:21.53,00:11:21.53,Can anyone hear the biscuits?
270,00:11:23.17,00:11:23.17," Oh, ho, we got   a team flag."
271,00:11:24.73,00:11:24.73,Whoo-hoo!
272,00:11:26.30,00:11:26.30,"If that's our latrine,"
273,00:11:27.60,00:11:27.60,"I say we dig a hole,"
274,00:11:28.60,00:11:28.60,"put this here, knock a board"
275,00:11:29.93,00:11:29.93,"out of the bottom, then we can keep"
276,00:11:31.47,00:11:31.47,moving it across.
277,00:11:32.47,00:11:32.47,Let's plug the hole.
278,00:11:34.23,00:11:34.23, SEAN: Let's sit down and talk   about what the hell
279,00:11:36.40,00:11:36.40,   we're going to do.
280,00:11:37.43,00:11:37.43,RICHARD:   Can I help?
281,00:11:38.90,00:11:38.90,"  When I asked earlier   about having a conversation,"
282,00:11:40.80,00:11:40.80,"that's what I was talking about,"
283,00:11:42.53,00:11:42.53, and I really can help with how we can do this.
284,00:11:44.77,00:11:44.77,We wanted to see...
285,00:11:45.97,00:11:45.97,"  You guys, we came over here to talk."
286,00:11:47.53,00:11:47.53,We just want to see what we...
287,00:11:49.20,00:11:49.20,RICHARD:    What happens when  people get together is
288,00:11:51.33,00:11:51.33,"   if they aren't all  headed in the same direction,"
289,00:11:53.70,00:11:53.70,"   toward a particular goal, then things that individuals do"
290,00:11:57.67,00:11:57.67," kind of get in the way  of the whole team, and I think"
291,00:12:01.27,00:12:01.27," it's really, really important   that what we decide"
292,00:12:04.20,00:12:04.20, be decided as a group.
293,00:12:05.67,00:12:05.67,"So, if you hear somebody saying something"
294,00:12:07.93,00:12:07.93,"   and you're all aggravated with them, stop,"
295,00:12:09.57,00:12:09.57,  don't try to make your point
296,00:12:10.93,00:12:10.93, and try and help them   make theirs.
297,00:12:12.20,00:12:12.20,"So, for example, you know, Sean,"
298,00:12:14.27,00:12:14.27,what do you think a main point
299,00:12:16.17,00:12:16.17,of what I'm trying to say now is?
300,00:12:18.13,00:12:18.13,I didn't listen to a word you...
301,00:12:19.80,00:12:19.80,"I've been daydreaming, thinking,    ""What am I going to eat?"""
302,00:12:22.47,00:12:22.47,"Well, you'll begin to figure that out..."
303,00:12:42.03,00:12:42.03,"All right, we got a stick up."
304,00:12:45.50,00:12:45.50,"Well, as long as they can hit the middle of this hole,"
305,00:12:48.03,00:12:48.03,we're all set here.
306,00:12:49.10,00:12:49.10,Put it right like this.
307,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,This is perfect.
308,00:12:58.63,00:12:58.63,"Hey, we found a water map!"
309,00:13:00.43,00:13:00.43,You got it?
310,00:13:01.67,00:13:01.67,  We got a water map.
311,00:13:03.00,00:13:03.00," B.B.:   ""Enter jungle here."""
312,00:13:04.67,00:13:04.67,"""Walk 375 paces"
313,00:13:07.03,00:13:07.03,"   along..."""
314,00:13:08.43,00:13:08.43,"Oh, we start here."
315,00:13:09.57,00:13:09.57,We go back to the other stream down there
316,00:13:12.27,00:13:12.27,and then we get the water here.
317,00:13:14.60,00:13:14.60, B.B.: Here's where we are right here.
318,00:13:16.93,00:13:16.93,We have to go across the stream.
319,00:13:18.70,00:13:18.70,We go across one stream...
320,00:13:20.43,00:13:20.43,"two streams, three streams.   Two streams,   three streams."
321,00:13:23.10,00:13:23.10,All right.
322,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50,"All right, we're ready to roll."
323,00:13:26.50,00:13:26.50,   All right.
324,00:13:27.53,00:13:27.53,You all right?
325,00:13:32.47,00:13:32.47,"Okay, is this the path?"
326,00:13:34.60,00:13:34.60,"Well, it said ""newly cut path."""
327,00:13:36.10,00:13:36.10,"It looks newly cut, but..."
328,00:13:37.53,00:13:37.53,"""trail washes out."""
329,00:13:38.63,00:13:38.63,"Oh, the trail washes out."
330,00:13:40.20,00:13:40.20,"Oh, wa...?"
331,00:13:41.37,00:13:41.37,No?
332,00:13:43.83,00:13:43.83, B.B.:    Why don't you stay there   for a minute?
333,00:13:46.70,00:13:46.70,  Let me walk
334,00:13:47.93,00:13:47.93,and keep you in sight...
335,00:13:48.97,00:13:48.97,Okay.
336,00:13:50.03,00:13:50.03,...to see if I see...
337,00:13:51.13,00:13:51.13,Anything?
338,00:13:52.67,00:13:52.67,  ...anything that resembles anything.
339,00:13:55.47,00:13:55.47,   ( sighs )
340,00:13:57.40,00:13:57.40,  Do you see anything?
341,00:13:58.87,00:13:58.87,Huh?
342,00:14:00.40,00:14:00.40,Look here.
343,00:14:04.13,00:14:04.13,"   I mean, come here and look at it."
344,00:14:05.60,00:14:05.60,"  Okay, ready?"
345,00:14:07.33,00:14:07.33,"Oh, thank you, Jesus."
346,00:14:09.33,00:14:09.33,Christ!
347,00:14:10.37,00:14:10.37,Yeah.
348,00:14:11.37,00:14:11.37,There we are. Go ahead.
349,00:14:12.70,00:14:12.70,All right.
350,00:14:13.70,00:14:13.70,"Way to go, B.B."
351,00:14:17.43,00:14:17.43,Don't let me drop sweat in there.
352,00:14:19.03,00:14:19.03,"Okay, it's almost full."
353,00:14:20.27,00:14:20.27,"You know, we could never do this,"
354,00:14:21.77,00:14:21.77,but you know what thought crossed my mind?
355,00:14:23.87,00:14:23.87,What?
356,00:14:25.43,00:14:25.43,As long as you and I always know where the water is
357,00:14:27.47,00:14:27.47,"and we got control of the water map,"
358,00:14:28.87,00:14:28.87,no one else will be able to vote you or I out.
359,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,We're not giving up the secret...
360,00:14:32.23,00:14:32.23,We're not giving up the secret.
361,00:14:33.60,00:14:33.60,...of the water supply.
362,00:14:34.77,00:14:34.77,That's right!
363,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,   ( all chuckling )
364,00:14:45.97,00:14:45.97,And your wife is how old now?
365,00:14:48.17,00:14:48.17,B.B.: My wife? Right now?
366,00:14:49.30,00:14:49.30,Yeah.
367,00:14:50.30,00:14:50.30,She's 45.
368,00:14:51.30,00:14:51.30,Wow. And how old are you?
369,00:14:52.73,00:14:52.73,64.
370,00:14:53.87,00:14:53.87,"   Oh, you better go."
371,00:14:54.87,00:14:54.87,You are a stud.
372,00:14:55.93,00:14:55.93,He's a stud!
373,00:14:56.93,00:14:56.93,His name's Viagra.
374,00:14:58.97,00:14:58.97,  Viagra. That's his nickname.
375,00:15:01.57,00:15:01.57, Dang!
376,00:15:03.07,00:15:03.07,"You know, you got to do    what you got to do, right?"
377,00:15:05.27,00:15:05.27,Somebody has to do the dirty work.
378,00:15:08.03,00:15:08.03, If we don't keep some humor...  we'll go mad.
379,00:15:16.60,00:15:16.60,"   Good night, y'all."
380,00:15:18.07,00:15:18.07,Good night.
381,00:15:19.13,00:15:19.13,Good night.
382,00:15:51.43,00:15:51.43,  Stretch out.
383,00:15:52.73,00:15:52.73, RUDY:    The hardest part
384,00:15:54.27,00:15:54.27,  is hanging around    with all these young kids.
385,00:15:56.10,00:15:56.10,"   I don't even know    what MTV means, you know?"
386,00:15:59.30,00:15:59.30, And I'm used to being  in the military
387,00:16:01.83,00:16:01.83," and one guy stands up,     he gives an order"
388,00:16:04.10,00:16:04.10,  and there's no back talk.
389,00:16:05.77,00:16:05.77,"   You know, like yesterday,"
390,00:16:07.57,00:16:07.57,   everybody's trying to run the show
391,00:16:10.03,00:16:10.03,"   and if they'd let    one person do it,"
392,00:16:12.03,00:16:12.03,we'd be much better off.
393,00:16:13.80,00:16:13.80,  But trying to keep them all shut up is hard.
394,00:16:16.70,00:16:16.70," If they listen to me,"
395,00:16:18.33,00:16:18.33,"  they'd all have haircuts  and everything else, you know."
396,00:16:20.87,00:16:20.87, We'd be in formation  in the morning
397,00:16:23.03,00:16:23.03,"  and all that kind of stuff,"
398,00:16:25.03,00:16:25.03, but they're not     going to do that.
399,00:16:27.23,00:16:27.23,"  I got to fit in, not them."
400,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33," You know, there's more of them   than there is of me."
401,00:16:31.53,00:16:31.53,"Hey, you got a pierced nipple, eh?"
402,00:16:33.77,00:16:33.77,Yeah. I got the ol' pierced nipple thing.
403,00:16:36.20,00:16:36.20,How did that feel?
404,00:16:37.37,00:16:37.37,"Pretty edgy for a doctor, right?"
405,00:16:39.37,00:16:39.37,"Yeah, yeah."
406,00:16:40.83,00:16:40.83,   I thought I was making it  with the hair
407,00:16:42.27,00:16:42.27," and then this morning,"
408,00:16:43.27,00:16:43.27, when I ran my hand through it
409,00:16:45.03,00:16:45.03," and felt these couple of golf ball-sized knots in it,"
410,00:16:48.10,00:16:48.10," I'm like, no, they got to come out now."
411,00:16:53.53,00:16:53.53,SONJA: I was doing something.
412,00:16:55.47,00:16:55.47,I don't even remember how I did it.
413,00:16:57.07,00:16:57.07,"Betadine won't hurt it, yeah, so we'll give it"
414,00:16:59.30,00:16:59.30,   a little shot of Betadine.
415,00:17:00.47,00:17:00.47,"I think these are the only sponges we have,"
416,00:17:02.53,00:17:02.53,so I'm just going to keep reusing them.
417,00:17:04.50,00:17:04.50,Okay.
418,00:17:06.30,00:17:06.30," SONJA:   I've been thrashing around   like I'm 35,"
419,00:17:08.30,00:17:08.30,"  instead of acting my age,"
420,00:17:10.60,00:17:10.60, but we have a doctor
421,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,"   in our tribe-- uh, Sean--    and he did a wonderful job"
422,00:17:16.23,00:17:16.23,  of bandaging me up.
423,00:17:18.30,00:17:18.30,  I think one of the problems    with aging
424,00:17:20.63,00:17:20.63," is the thinning of the skin,     darn it,"
425,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,and so I think I'm maybe getting a little more banged up
426,00:17:25.53,00:17:25.53, than some of the younger ones.
427,00:17:30.00,00:17:30.00,"My aim leaves something to be desired,"
428,00:17:31.33,00:17:31.33,but we're getting there.
429,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,Try this?
430,00:17:33.97,00:17:33.97,"Well, I don't know."
431,00:17:35.17,00:17:35.17,This is heavier.
432,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,"It might be sharper, though."
433,00:17:38.53,00:17:38.53,Think so?
434,00:17:39.90,00:17:39.90,I'm wondering 'cause that's so damn hard.
435,00:17:42.13,00:17:42.13,"Well, that's off."
436,00:17:43.13,00:17:43.13,That ain't gonna work.
437,00:17:44.63,00:17:44.63,"  Here's a, uh, a therapist's  version of ""Bye, Bye, Blues,"""
438,00:17:48.07,00:17:48.07, if I can remember it.
439,00:17:49.50,00:17:49.50,   \xe2\x99\xaa Bye-bye blues \xe2\x99\xaa
440,00:17:52.77,00:17:52.77,  \xe2\x99\xaa Thanks to Prozac \xe2\x99\xaa
441,00:17:54.23,00:17:54.23,   \xe2\x99\xaa Bye-bye blues \xe2\x99\xaa
442,00:17:56.77,00:17:56.77,   \xe2\x99\xaa Give me Paxil \xe2\x99\xaa
443,00:17:58.50,00:17:58.50,"   \xe2\x99\xaa Bells ring, birds sing \xe2\x99\xaa"
444,00:18:03.00,00:18:03.00,"   \xe2\x99\xaa Sun is shining,    no more whining \xe2\x99\xaa"
445,00:18:07.47,00:18:07.47,"   \xe2\x99\xaa I live through, ba, da, da-da \xe2\x99\xaa"
446,00:18:11.50,00:18:11.50,"\xe2\x99\xaa Life is hell, but I'm swell \xe2\x99\xaa"
447,00:18:15.50,00:18:15.50,"\xe2\x99\xaa Bye-bye, bye blues. \xe2\x99\xaa"
448,00:18:19.50,00:18:19.50," Yeah, that's awesome, awesome."
449,00:18:21.73,00:18:21.73,   Fantastic.
450,00:18:28.20,00:18:28.20,"RICHARD:  Well, the fish traps    were hanging from the boat"
451,00:18:30.87,00:18:30.87," that we were coming over here,"
452,00:18:32.53,00:18:32.53,  and when we were tossed into the sea on the raft
453,00:18:34.93,00:18:34.93,"  and we could take whatever    we could get our hands on,"
454,00:18:37.43,00:18:37.43,  we grabbed     three or four fish traps
455,00:18:39.13,00:18:39.13,"  and a bunch of rat traps,"
456,00:18:40.63,00:18:40.63, and so we stuck the rat traps   out the first night
457,00:18:42.77,00:18:42.77,and boom-- we got a rat in each of them.
458,00:18:47.93,00:18:47.93,Bait. I want bait!
459,00:18:49.00,00:18:49.00,Give me bait!
460,00:18:55.67,00:18:55.67,I think he's just going to cut its head off.
461,00:19:00.20,00:19:00.20,Ew!
462,00:19:01.40,00:19:01.40,"Oh, God!"
463,00:19:02.47,00:19:02.47,"Oh, no way!"
464,00:19:04.30,00:19:04.30,( laughing )
465,00:19:07.93,00:19:07.93,Remember that knife.
466,00:19:09.00,00:19:09.00,We're not using it for anything else.
467,00:19:11.93,00:19:11.93,"Oh, dude!"
468,00:19:16.00,00:19:16.00,RAMONA:  I didn't sleep at all.
469,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90," I mean,  we-we closed our eyes."
470,00:19:19.83,00:19:19.83, We kept hearing noises
471,00:19:21.40,00:19:21.40,"  and, like, clicking sounds,  and we're, like, okay."
472,00:19:24.60,00:19:24.60," Um, what's his name..."
473,00:19:25.87,00:19:25.87,WOMAN:: Joel.
474,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,"   Uh, Joel woke up,   a rat was, like, in his ear."
475,00:19:30.27,00:19:30.27, JOEL:   I heard something squeaking    in my ear.
476,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,"  A rat was trying    to get on the raft,"
477,00:19:33.63,00:19:33.63, or get near us   or get at something.
478,00:19:35.30,00:19:35.30," I mean, everything was moving."
479,00:19:38.90,00:19:38.90, B.B.:    We're just going   along the beach here
480,00:19:41.13,00:19:41.13, and just identifying   whatever we can use
481,00:19:43.47,00:19:43.47,"  for the shelter, the roof."
482,00:19:45.47,00:19:45.47,  And I'm a little irritated
483,00:19:48.13,00:19:48.13,that none of the others
484,00:19:49.63,00:19:49.63," are down here to help  carry stuff, but that's okay."
485,00:19:52.10,00:19:52.10,   We need...   we need five more of these.
486,00:19:55.97,00:19:55.97,B.B....
487,00:19:57.53,00:19:57.53," He's a character, man."
488,00:19:59.30,00:19:59.30,I don't think he likes me much.
489,00:20:01.90,00:20:01.90,Just these.
490,00:20:03.17,00:20:03.17,"No, no,  you don't understand."
491,00:20:04.60,00:20:04.60, I got to have this thought out  and positioned right.
492,00:20:07.67,00:20:07.67,"GRETCHEN: He's right, Joel,"
493,00:20:09.17,00:20:09.17,or it's not going to fit the frame.
494,00:20:11.03,00:20:11.03,"Joel, trust me."
495,00:20:12.03,00:20:12.03,I'm not the one bitching.
496,00:20:13.57,00:20:13.57,"   I mean, I'm fine."
497,00:20:17.63,00:20:17.63,"Hey, don't be talking to me"
498,00:20:18.97,00:20:18.97,about monkey business.
499,00:20:19.97,00:20:19.97,"I can't sleep, so I'm usually up."
500,00:20:23.10,00:20:23.10,...this being the width.
501,00:20:46.53,00:20:46.53, B.B.:   We got a lot of lazy people
502,00:20:48.47,00:20:48.47, if you want to know the truth.
503,00:20:49.80,00:20:49.80, You can't do it all yourself.
504,00:20:51.87,00:20:51.87,"   You know, I asked Colleen  to straighten this out for me"
505,00:20:54.90,00:20:54.90,and here it is.
506,00:20:56.40,00:20:56.40, That's the only thing   she had to do today.
507,00:20:58.53,00:20:58.53,  You can't have lazy people.
508,00:21:00.63,00:21:00.63,"   GRETCHEN:  He had been out there,    you know, all morning long"
509,00:21:03.20,00:21:03.20,"  and, um... you know,   it was hot."
510,00:21:06.47,00:21:06.47,"GRETCHEN: B.B., I thought we said that this was a time of day,"
511,00:21:10.30,00:21:10.30,we were going to be out of the sun.
512,00:21:12.40,00:21:12.40,"  Well, but for some of us...   some of the people,"
513,00:21:14.73,00:21:14.73,  it's been all day that way.
514,00:21:16.20,00:21:16.20,"Right, it's your turn."
515,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,You tell me what you're doing here
516,00:21:20.00,00:21:20.00,and I'll help you.
517,00:21:21.30,00:21:21.30,You hold it up
518,00:21:22.30,00:21:22.30,and I'll do it quick.
519,00:21:23.37,00:21:23.37,"I promise you, I'll do it quick."
520,00:21:25.10,00:21:25.10,"That, you know,"
521,00:21:26.60,00:21:26.60,"that's the right way to do it,"
522,00:21:28.00,00:21:28.00,but we won't have near enough line
523,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,to build the roof and do that
524,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,"if we do all this,"
525,00:21:31.67,00:21:31.67,in all fairness.
526,00:21:33.10,00:21:33.10,"Anyway, don't stop now, but..."
527,00:21:35.70,00:21:35.70,"I think we'll have plenty,"
528,00:21:37.97,00:21:37.97,"and I'm going to roll that up for you, too."
529,00:21:41.77,00:21:41.77,"We can't, like, get burned out, though."
530,00:21:43.70,00:21:43.70,I'm not burned out.
531,00:21:44.70,00:21:44.70,"I know, but you will be"
532,00:21:45.90,00:21:45.90,if you spend all day out in the sun.
533,00:21:47.53,00:21:47.53,"No, I never get burned out."
534,00:21:48.87,00:21:48.87,You don't know me.
535,00:21:49.97,00:21:49.97,"I don't know you, but I know human beings."
536,00:21:51.73,00:21:51.73,Okay.
537,00:21:52.87,00:21:52.87,I like working as a hobby.
538,00:21:54.03,00:21:54.03,"Honest to God, how about 15 minutes though?"
539,00:21:55.90,00:21:55.90,Sit down for 15 minutes.
540,00:21:57.00,00:21:57.00,"Why? Yeah, but, I want to get..."
541,00:21:58.53,00:21:58.53,I want to get this thing stabilized so at least...
542,00:22:00.70,00:22:00.70,"But, B.B., look..."
543,00:22:02.50,00:22:02.50,  Let me just explain.
544,00:22:03.97,00:22:03.97,I want to get this stabilized so then people can come in here...
545,00:22:07.37,00:22:07.37,You know the light cords you got?
546,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17," And we can tie    these things down,"
547,00:22:10.70,00:22:10.70,  but until I get this bounce  out of this...
548,00:22:12.80,00:22:12.80, I want to... I'm going to put a support there
549,00:22:15.17,00:22:15.17,in the middle here and right there.
550,00:22:19.00,00:22:19.00,"'Cause if not, we got to take bounce out of this."
551,00:22:20.93,00:22:20.93,I just think we have plenty of time.
552,00:22:22.63,00:22:22.63,"I thought we were going to try to stay competitive,"
553,00:22:25.03,00:22:25.03,and if you work all day
554,00:22:26.03,00:22:26.03,"and you're burnt at the end of the day,"
555,00:22:27.47,00:22:27.47,we're not going to be competitive.
556,00:22:29.03,00:22:29.03,"Take a break, and if it bounces a little tonight,"
557,00:22:30.57,00:22:30.57,then we'll fix it tomorrow.
558,00:22:32.67,00:22:32.67,"   I'm going to keep working,   sweetheart."
559,00:22:34.67,00:22:34.67,You're going to get burned out.
560,00:22:35.67,00:22:35.67,"No, I'm not."
561,00:22:36.67,00:22:36.67,"Yeah, you are."
562,00:22:37.67,00:22:37.67,You already are.
563,00:22:51.47,00:22:51.47," B.B.: Oh, my."
564,00:22:59.83,00:22:59.83,You're doing fine.
565,00:23:00.90,00:23:00.90,Too much paper.
566,00:23:01.90,00:23:01.90,Yeah.
567,00:23:04.03,00:23:04.03, Bifocals work?
568,00:23:05.73,00:23:05.73,Bifocals worked.
569,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,"You the man, B."
570,00:23:08.90,00:23:08.90,"No, she took my bifocals..."
571,00:23:10.73,00:23:10.73,We're both the man.
572,00:23:12.17,00:23:12.17,And made it happen.
573,00:23:13.53,00:23:13.53, B.B.:  And the fire started
574,00:23:15.57,00:23:15.57, because I had bought     a set of glasses with me.
575,00:23:19.07,00:23:19.07,  I was going to do it
576,00:23:20.57,00:23:20.57,"  and Gretchen said,   ""Why don't I do it?"
577,00:23:22.53,00:23:22.53,"   I know how to do it, too.""   So, I said, ""Great."""
578,00:23:24.60,00:23:24.60,"  Nice, guys. You guys split up and everything."
579,00:23:26.47,00:23:26.47,Amen.
580,00:23:26.47,00:23:26.47,Good work.
581,00:23:27.70,00:23:27.70, B.B.:  And she took my glasses
582,00:23:28.90,00:23:28.90, and started the fire.
583,00:23:31.13,00:23:31.13," You did well, Gretch."
584,00:23:36.00,00:23:36.00,"If we get fire,"
585,00:23:37.63,00:23:37.63,  it means we're going to have    a hot meal in our stomach
586,00:23:40.80,00:23:40.80,   which is going to bring up   team morale.
587,00:23:42.93,00:23:42.93,"That first meal    might be rat soup,"
588,00:23:44.67,00:23:44.67,"which I'm, like,   looking forward to very much"
589,00:23:47.23,00:23:47.23, because there's nothing wrong   with a rat.
590,00:23:49.57,00:23:49.57,"  All a rat is, is a squirrel  without a fuzzy tail."
591,00:23:52.37,00:23:52.37,   Let's just work with this.
592,00:23:54.07,00:23:54.07,Okay.
593,00:23:55.43,00:23:55.43," I'm thinking,   if we could work with this,"
594,00:23:57.20,00:23:57.20,we're getting a ton of smoke.
595,00:23:59.27,00:23:59.27,Start that piece of wood?
596,00:23:59.27,00:23:59.27,"  If we get a piece of bamboo,"
597,00:24:01.63,00:24:01.63,  someone sits here and holds  the bamboo right here
598,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73,with the kindling in it.
599,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73,With the kindling in it.
600,00:24:05.87,00:24:05.87,   You know what I'm saying?
601,00:24:07.13,00:24:07.13,Here we go.
602,00:24:15.07,00:24:15.07," Come on, Dirk."
603,00:24:18.60,00:24:18.60,Go big.
604,00:24:19.70,00:24:19.70,This isn't going to catch.
605,00:24:24.97,00:24:24.97," Well, you want   to just keep trying?"
606,00:24:27.10,00:24:27.10,Why don't we try and make the bough?
607,00:24:29.23,00:24:29.23,  MAN:  Go...!
608,00:24:31.30,00:24:31.30,Come on!   We're getting there!
609,00:24:32.60,00:24:32.60,All right! Okay!
610,00:24:34.20,00:24:34.20,Don't stop! Don't stop!
611,00:24:36.20,00:24:36.20,There was smoke. We lost it.
612,00:24:38.50,00:24:38.50,A lot of smoke.
613,00:24:38.50,00:24:38.50,Yeah.
614,00:24:39.53,00:24:39.53,   Don't you guys...
615,00:24:40.53,00:24:40.53,Cool!
616,00:24:42.83,00:24:42.83,   How much more do we need?
617,00:24:43.83,00:24:43.83,I don't know.
618,00:24:44.90,00:24:44.90, How much more?
619,00:24:45.90,00:24:45.90, That'll do it.
620,00:24:46.90,00:24:46.90," You in, Rich?"
621,00:24:48.00,00:24:48.00,Here we go. Here we go.
622,00:24:49.80,00:24:49.80,"Work it, Rich."
623,00:24:51.07,00:24:51.07,Yeah.
624,00:24:52.13,00:24:52.13,What?
625,00:24:53.13,00:24:53.13,You guys get ready to take his spot.
626,00:24:56.60,00:24:56.60,"Take a break, man."
627,00:24:57.93,00:24:57.93,We made a lot smoke but no fire.
628,00:25:00.20,00:25:00.20,"I think it would have been nice  if we had fire,"
629,00:25:02.53,00:25:02.53,  but we're not going   to catch fish
630,00:25:03.97,00:25:03.97, unless we have fire to cook it
631,00:25:05.83,00:25:05.83,"  and I think that     if we had fire,"
632,00:25:07.27,00:25:07.27,  we could have spent   a lot of time sitting
633,00:25:09.80,00:25:09.80,   around the bonfire  at night maybe singing songs.
634,00:25:11.77,00:25:11.77,"  We have a ukulele, you know,"
635,00:25:13.27,00:25:13.27, and that didn't happen    and I wish it did.
636,00:25:14.87,00:25:14.87," Throughout their time  on the island,"
637,00:25:17.13,00:25:17.13,the tribes will compete    in a series of challenges.
638,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,They'll receive messages
639,00:25:21.80,00:25:21.80, notifying them  of these competitions
640,00:25:24.07,00:25:24.07,  at their tree mail.
641,00:25:25.47,00:25:25.47,"  Today's challenge is for both reward,"
642,00:25:27.77,00:25:27.77,"  in the form of 50 waterproof  matches, and immunity."
643,00:25:31.13,00:25:31.13," Win immunity, you stay on the island a few days longer."
644,00:25:34.97,00:25:34.97,"   Lose, face Tribal Council,"
645,00:25:36.67,00:25:36.67, where you must vote one member off the island.
646,00:25:48.40,00:25:48.40,Ooh.
647,00:25:51.93,00:25:51.93,A map to fire.
648,00:25:53.30,00:25:53.30,It's got to be.
649,00:25:54.80,00:25:54.80,"""Cold food, dark camp,"
650,00:25:56.27,00:25:56.27,"""just a reminder of your first night."
651,00:25:58.80,00:25:58.80,"It looks so easy in the book."" Yes."
652,00:26:01.27,00:26:01.27,"""Why is it so hard to light?"
653,00:26:03.33,00:26:03.33,"""Tonight your tribe will carry the torch."
654,00:26:05.57,00:26:05.57,"""One tribe takes home the flame."
655,00:26:07.93,00:26:07.93,"The other gives someone the boot."""
656,00:26:10.77,00:26:10.77, Whoa!
657,00:26:12.10,00:26:12.10,Whoa.
658,00:26:13.47,00:26:13.47,I guess they're combining the reward
659,00:26:15.13,00:26:15.13, and immunity challenge    this time.
660,00:26:16.67,00:26:16.67," That's the competition    is taking home the flame,"
661,00:26:18.67,00:26:18.67,  but what's the competition?   We've got no freakin' idea.
662,00:26:34.00,00:26:34.00,"Welcome, tribes, to your first challenge."
663,00:26:36.43,00:26:36.43,Congratulations   on your first night
664,00:26:38.43,00:26:38.43,on the island--  should be very proud.
665,00:26:40.60,00:26:40.60,I know both of you guys have food.
666,00:26:42.60,00:26:42.60,You found some fresh water
667,00:26:44.50,00:26:44.50,"and I think, Pagong, you guys had fire."
668,00:26:47.10,00:26:47.10,   ( cheers )
669,00:26:48.10,00:26:48.10,Right on.
670,00:26:49.17,00:26:49.17,   A lot of work to get fire.
671,00:26:50.33,00:26:50.33,Yeah.
672,00:26:51.33,00:26:51.33,"Yeah, it takes a lot of work."
673,00:26:53.00,00:26:53.00,"With the threat of rain always a constant,"
674,00:26:54.63,00:26:54.63,"even if you guys did have fire,"
675,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,you're certainly not back there   tending to them now.
676,00:26:58.43,00:26:58.43, 50 waterproof matches    should certainly make that
677,00:27:00.53,00:27:00.53,a lot easier.
678,00:27:01.53,00:27:01.53,It's one of the things
679,00:27:03.40,00:27:03.40,you're playing for tonight-- the other is this:
680,00:27:05.47,00:27:05.47,"I want everybody to touch this, get a good feel of this."
681,00:27:07.97,00:27:07.97,   This is your life  on the island.
682,00:27:09.60,00:27:09.60,   This is the immunity idol.
683,00:27:11.00,00:27:11.00,Oh. Ah.
684,00:27:12.13,00:27:12.13,"   Win this,"
685,00:27:13.20,00:27:13.20,you stay on the island a few days longer.
686,00:27:15.13,00:27:15.13,Lose...
687,00:27:16.37,00:27:16.37,"you face    tomorrow's Tribal Council,"
688,00:27:18.23,00:27:18.23,where one of you will be
689,00:27:19.60,00:27:19.60,the first person voted off the island.
690,00:27:21.57,00:27:21.57,   Big enough stakes?
691,00:27:22.57,00:27:22.57,"Oh, yeah."
692,00:27:23.57,00:27:23.57," Okay, here's what we're doing."
693,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,  There are two rafts
694,00:27:26.50,00:27:26.50,about 150 feet out in the water.
695,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,  Your job is to get your raft    back to the beach.
696,00:27:31.43,00:27:31.43,"Along the way, a series   of torches both in the water"
697,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83,and on the land.
698,00:27:35.33,00:27:35.33,  First team to light    all their torches
699,00:27:37.03,00:27:37.03,   and their side of the fire  spirit wins immunity.
700,00:27:39.63,00:27:39.63,Here are the rules: Each tribe member
701,00:27:41.63,00:27:41.63,has to have one hand on the raft
702,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50,at all times-- at all times.
703,00:27:45.40,00:27:45.40,Nobody can swim ahead.
704,00:27:46.67,00:27:46.67,Nobody can fall behind.
705,00:27:47.90,00:27:47.90,The other rule: you have to light every torch.
706,00:27:50.00,00:27:50.00,  Don't put me in the position
707,00:27:51.47,00:27:51.47,   of having to make    a judgment call.
708,00:27:52.77,00:27:52.77,I don't want to.    There's too much at stake.
709,00:27:54.43,00:27:54.43,Clear?
710,00:27:55.47,00:27:55.47,  ALL:  Clear.
711,00:27:56.47,00:27:56.47,"All right, swim out to your rafts."
712,00:27:58.40,00:27:58.40,Wait for my signal.
713,00:28:08.57,00:28:08.57," Okay, Sue, listen up."
714,00:28:10.33,00:28:10.33,   You're going to hold this.
715,00:28:13.10,00:28:13.10,How's that feel for you carrying?
716,00:28:14.93,00:28:14.93, JEFF:   Here we go!
717,00:28:16.70,00:28:16.70,A storm is approaching!
718,00:28:18.30,00:28:18.30,   Waterproof matches  and immunity at stake!

723,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17,You got to lift.
724,00:28:25.03,00:28:25.03,"Come on, team!"
725,00:28:29.70,00:28:29.70,Here we go! Light it! Light it!
726,00:28:32.00,00:28:32.00,Dry run it. Dry run it.
727,00:28:34.17,00:28:34.17,"Go, go, go!"
728,00:28:35.30,00:28:35.30,Slow it down.
729,00:28:36.93,00:28:36.93,Go!
730,00:28:38.07,00:28:38.07,Here we go.
731,00:28:38.07,00:28:38.07,"Come on, y'all. Come on."
732,00:28:40.23,00:28:40.23,Do not wait for me.
733,00:28:41.90,00:28:41.90,( all yelling )
734,00:28:43.70,00:28:43.70,"  No, no, no!"
735,00:28:45.43,00:28:45.43,Go. Go. We got it.
736,00:28:48.50,00:28:48.50,Good job.
737,00:28:50.20,00:28:50.20,  Go!
738,00:28:51.40,00:28:51.40,( all yelling )

740,00:28:55.87,00:28:55.87,( all yelling )
741,00:28:56.93,00:28:56.93,Throw it!
742,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,Go! Here we go! Come on!
743,00:28:59.90,00:28:59.90,To the flag!
744,00:29:01.77,00:29:01.77,   Calm down.
745,00:29:02.90,00:29:02.90,Pick it up. Pick it up.
746,00:29:04.20,00:29:04.20,Here comes the wave.
747,00:29:05.57,00:29:05.57,Pick it up. Pick it up.
748,00:29:06.83,00:29:06.83,Let's go.
749,00:29:08.70,00:29:08.70,   Move it! Move it! Move it!
750,00:29:10.03,00:29:10.03,"Move it, move it, move it!"
751,00:29:11.73,00:29:11.73,"Move it, move it, move it!"
752,00:29:13.27,00:29:13.27,Make sure you get it.
753,00:29:18.23,00:29:18.23,Let's go!
754,00:29:19.50,00:29:19.50,Here we go! Let's go!

768,00:29:41.73,00:29:41.73,Going back!
769,00:29:43.00,00:29:43.00,It's lit! It's lit!
770,00:29:45.17,00:29:45.17,"No, keep it there."
771,00:29:46.43,00:29:46.43,We got it!
772,00:29:47.43,00:29:47.43,Yay!

774,00:29:50.70,00:29:50.70,"Yeah, baby!"
775,00:29:52.70,00:29:52.70,( screaming )
776,00:29:54.63,00:29:54.63,  Yes!
777,00:29:57.97,00:29:57.97,"JEFF: Guys, great competition."
778,00:30:00.03,00:30:00.03,Really close.
779,00:30:01.53,00:30:01.53,"Pagong, you get fire in the form"
780,00:30:04.23,00:30:04.23,of 50 waterproof matches.
781,00:30:06.03,00:30:06.03,( team yelling )
782,00:30:08.47,00:30:08.47,And more importantly...
783,00:30:10.20,00:30:10.20,immunity from tomorrow's Tribal Council.
784,00:30:13.03,00:30:13.03,You'll stay on the island a few more days.
785,00:30:15.10,00:30:15.10,Yes!
786,00:30:15.10,00:30:15.10,This is happening every time!
787,00:30:16.70,00:30:16.70,"Every time, this is happening!"
788,00:30:19.03,00:30:19.03,Every time!
789,00:30:20.30,00:30:20.30,JEFF: Tagi.
790,00:30:21.57,00:30:21.57,That's why we're winning.
791,00:30:23.13,00:30:23.13,We're going to stay...
792,00:30:24.60,00:30:24.60,Our island!
793,00:30:25.60,00:30:25.60,Tagi.
794,00:30:26.73,00:30:26.73,Nice competition.
795,00:30:27.77,00:30:27.77,You know the drill.
796,00:30:29.37,00:30:29.37,"You have a date with me tomorrow for the Tribal Council,"
797,00:30:31.90,00:30:31.90,where one of you will be
798,00:30:33.53,00:30:33.53,the first person voted off.
799,00:31:37.23,00:31:37.23,  You guys seen Dirk?
800,00:31:39.47,00:31:39.47,   Where the hell did he go?
801,00:31:43.80,00:31:43.80," Oh, he goes...  He brought his bible with him?"
802,00:31:47.23,00:31:47.23,Yeah.
803,00:31:47.23,00:31:47.23,Yeah.
804,00:31:48.23,00:31:48.23,I think he's pretty religious.
805,00:31:49.70,00:31:49.70,He was telling me he was  a youth minister or something.
806,00:31:52.63,00:31:52.63,  ( reading quietly )
807,00:32:12.13,00:32:12.13,Rain's coming.
808,00:32:13.40,00:32:13.40,Again?
809,00:32:15.17,00:32:15.17,That's all right.
810,00:32:16.17,00:32:16.17,I could always use a wash.
811,00:32:17.90,00:32:17.90," RUDY: Before we got  on the island here,"
812,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,"  I formed opinions   about people,"
813,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90, but I changed my mind  just on that trip in.
814,00:32:25.70,00:32:25.70," Rich, for one."
815,00:32:27.00,00:32:27.00," I mean, this guy is...   He's strong."
816,00:32:29.30,00:32:29.30,  He's smart.
817,00:32:30.30,00:32:30.30, The guy surprises me.
818,00:32:31.87,00:32:31.87,"You know, he's fat, but he's..."
819,00:32:34.10,00:32:34.10, ( chuckling ):    he's good.
820,00:32:35.40,00:32:35.40,You can lay it over those.
821,00:32:36.87,00:32:36.87,   RICHARD:  I like Rudy.
822,00:32:37.87,00:32:37.87,  I'm not bothered
823,00:32:39.03,00:32:39.03,  by his straightforwardness  at all.
824,00:32:40.27,00:32:40.27, I don't think
825,00:32:41.33,00:32:41.33,  it's even a problem.
826,00:32:42.33,00:32:42.33,  I-I like it that he's saying
827,00:32:43.63,00:32:43.63,"""Hey, do this,""   or, ""Hey, do that,"""
828,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,but people are thinking of that   as very direct and arrogant.
829,00:32:47.60,00:32:47.60," That's the word I'm hearing,    and I'm thinking to myself"
830,00:32:50.03,00:32:50.03,"""Well, they think he's arrogant;  Oh, my God, I'm out of here!"""
831,00:32:56.07,00:32:56.07,   ( thuds )
832,00:33:02.60,00:33:02.60,"  Oh, my gosh."
833,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,What do we got?
834,00:33:05.53,00:33:05.53,The good news is  we'll be having fire tonight.
835,00:33:08.63,00:33:08.63,The bad news is one of us won't be here to enjoy it.
836,00:33:11.30,00:33:11.30, We got Tribal Council tonight.
837,00:33:12.60,00:33:12.60,"""Pack your bags, get ready to go,"
838,00:33:14.07,00:33:14.07,"which one it will be, the world will soon know."""
839,00:33:16.40,00:33:16.40,"KELLY:   Unfortunately, we're going   to have to vote somebody off."
840,00:33:19.60,00:33:19.60,  There's going to be a lot of tension
841,00:33:21.23,00:33:21.23,and one of us is going to leave.
842,00:33:23.10,00:33:23.10,"Well, what time we got to do this at?"
843,00:33:25.60,00:33:25.60,"It just said, ""Get ready to go."""
844,00:33:28.23,00:33:28.23," Just, ""Pack your bags,     get ready to go."""
845,00:33:32.77,00:33:32.77,I can't believe   we have to pack up.
846,00:33:34.93,00:33:34.93,  We're just getting settled.
847,00:33:36.80,00:33:36.80," Well, somebody's gone."
848,00:33:38.00,00:33:38.00," So, it's time to think"
849,00:33:39.40,00:33:39.40,  about who are they going   to vote for?
850,00:33:41.07,00:33:41.07,  Why are they going to vote?
851,00:33:42.57,00:33:42.57, I've narrowed it down to four.
852,00:33:44.10,00:33:44.10,I'm one of them.
853,00:33:46.33,00:33:46.33,"   Well, it could mean a lot"
854,00:33:47.90,00:33:47.90,"  uh, either staying   or being voted out."
855,00:33:50.03,00:33:50.03,"  You know,     last night's competition,"
856,00:33:52.23,00:33:52.23,  I really feel responsible    because I couldn't keep up
857,00:33:55.93,00:33:55.93,  and I was dragged totally   off my feet.
858,00:33:58.67,00:33:58.67,  I do feel that that stumble     probably cost us
859,00:34:01.70,00:34:01.70,"the immunity challenge,  and that's a big one."
860,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27," Up until, uh,   probably last night,"
861,00:34:06.47,00:34:06.47,I never gave it a second thought
862,00:34:08.77,00:34:08.77, about who I was going   to vote off
863,00:34:11.00,00:34:11.00," or if I got voted off,   but after last night, uh..."
864,00:34:14.37,00:34:14.37,"  I thought about it then,    and I decided then."
865,00:34:18.37,00:34:18.37,"I feel pretty secure, actually, about the vote tonight."
866,00:34:21.23,00:34:21.23, Kelly and I get along     real well
867,00:34:23.23,00:34:23.23, and we've been talking
868,00:34:24.80,00:34:24.80," about strategy, and, you know,  who's not contributing"
869,00:34:27.23,00:34:27.23," as much, and who would be best   to vote off,"
870,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,   and I think we-we've come   to a mutual decision
871,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50,and we've talked to Sue    about it.
872,00:34:34.43,00:34:34.43," Stacey came up to me, and it's, like,"
873,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20,  she don't like Rudy
874,00:34:38.70,00:34:38.70,"  and she's, like,"
875,00:34:40.20,00:34:40.20,"  ""Oh, I think we're going    to vote for Rudy,"""
876,00:34:42.23,00:34:42.23,"  and vote him off     'cause he's so barking."""
877,00:34:43.97,00:34:43.97,"  Well, anybody's too barking  and too bossy to Stacey"
878,00:34:46.63,00:34:46.63,  because she doesn't   move her ass.
879,00:34:48.37,00:34:48.37,"  The chicks think I'm voting   for one person, and I'm not."
880,00:34:59.77,00:34:59.77,"This is Tribal Council, where each week"
881,00:35:02.50,00:35:02.50,one member will be voted off the island.
882,00:35:05.30,00:35:05.30,"  Last night,   in a crushing defeat"
883,00:35:07.40,00:35:07.40," Tagi lost the immunity    challenge,"
884,00:35:09.33,00:35:09.33,"so, tonight, they will come here  and vote the first person off."
885,00:35:13.60,00:35:13.60, It all begins   with a dangerous hike
886,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,  through the jungle.
887,00:35:20.43,00:35:20.43,"  With so little time    to get acquainted,"
888,00:35:22.67,00:35:22.67, everyone is vulnerable.
889,00:35:26.10,00:35:26.10,  Rich's talk-versus-action     approach
890,00:35:28.07,00:35:28.07, may be more annoying   than helpful.
891,00:35:32.60,00:35:32.60, Sonja's tumble     cost them dearly.
892,00:35:35.73,00:35:35.73,  One thing's for certain:
893,00:35:37.73,00:35:37.73,"  At Tribal Council,     you are held accountable"
894,00:35:40.87,00:35:40.87,  for your actions.
895,00:35:41.87,00:35:41.87, There will be a vote.
896,00:35:43.20,00:35:43.20, Someone is going home.
897,00:35:44.90,00:35:44.90, I see torches.
898,00:35:46.60,00:35:46.60,"Oh, that looks pretty hairy."
899,00:35:48.50,00:35:48.50,   ( birds chirping )
900,00:35:53.40,00:35:53.40,( gong sounds )
901,00:35:55.07,00:35:55.07,  Make our way around.
902,00:36:09.73,00:36:09.73,We begin Tribal Council
903,00:36:11.23,00:36:11.23, with a ritual.
904,00:36:12.23,00:36:12.23, Behind each of you is a torch.
905,00:36:14.13,00:36:14.13, I'd like you to grab the torch  and approach the fire.
906,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43,Go ahead and dip your torches
907,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,in the flame and light them.
908,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,"Put them back in their slot, and take a seat."
909,00:36:24.60,00:36:24.60,We do this because--
910,00:36:25.90,00:36:25.90,as I'm sure you've discovered--
911,00:36:28.57,00:36:28.57," on the island,  fire represents life."
912,00:36:30.13,00:36:30.13,"  These torches now represent your life, your identity"
913,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,here at Tribal Council.
914,00:36:33.90,00:36:33.90,The good news is
915,00:36:35.43,00:36:35.43,  you will take these torches with you when you leave
916,00:36:37.53,00:36:37.53," so you will have fire,"
917,00:36:38.77,00:36:38.77,and you will bring them  back with you
918,00:36:40.23,00:36:40.23,to each Tribal Council.
919,00:36:41.40,00:36:41.40,Go ahead and have a seat.
920,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,"Well, leave it to me to state the obvious,"
921,00:36:45.27,00:36:45.27,but this is not a place you want to be.
922,00:36:47.60,00:36:47.60,You tread in dangerous territory    every time you come here.
923,00:36:50.73,00:36:50.73,Tribal Council is basically
924,00:36:52.27,00:36:52.27,where you account for your actions on the island.
925,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,Some of those actions
926,00:36:56.23,00:36:56.23,will come back to help you.
927,00:36:57.77,00:36:57.77,"Some of them may come back to haunt you,"
928,00:36:59.97,00:36:59.97,"but tonight, based on those actions,"
929,00:37:01.67,00:37:01.67,one of you will be the first person voted off the island.
930,00:37:03.90,00:37:03.90,"So, before we get to the vote,"
931,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,let's talk about  what's been going on.
932,00:37:07.97,00:37:07.97,  I'm curious just about you guys getting here
933,00:37:09.90,00:37:09.90,and finding this place.
934,00:37:11.07,00:37:11.07,How was the journey over here?
935,00:37:13.03,00:37:13.03, Saw two deadly snakes.
936,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03,Really?
937,00:37:15.03,00:37:15.03,SUSAN: Grand Canyon
938,00:37:16.23,00:37:16.23, mud slides...
939,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,It was great.
940,00:37:18.60,00:37:18.60,It was fun.
941,00:37:19.60,00:37:19.60,We're still starving.
942,00:37:21.53,00:37:21.53,We've eaten but not really.
943,00:37:22.70,00:37:22.70,SONJA: The competition is stiffer.
944,00:37:24.60,00:37:24.60,The competition
945,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"  we had last night was tough,"
946,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,tougher than I had anticipated.
947,00:37:28.87,00:37:28.87,"How are you holding up,   physically?"
948,00:37:30.37,00:37:30.37,"SONJA: Well, pretty well, you know."
949,00:37:32.27,00:37:32.27,"   I'll fight to the finish,   but, uh, I have my blisters"
950,00:37:35.97,00:37:35.97,"  and whatnot, but I'm-I'm doing okay."
951,00:37:38.40,00:37:38.40, What happened  after Quest for Fire?
952,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83, That was a great competition--
953,00:37:41.27,00:37:41.27,"obviously, a lot at stake."
954,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,"SONJA: Oh, God."
955,00:37:43.63,00:37:43.63, We came close.
956,00:37:44.70,00:37:44.70,   We almost got it.
957,00:37:45.83,00:37:45.83,"SUSAN: Aw, man, we were dragged down two times"
958,00:37:47.70,00:37:47.70,and we were right there.
959,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,We almost got it.
960,00:37:50.00,00:37:50.00,SUSAN: There's no way.
961,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,"All right, guys, well..."
962,00:37:52.77,00:37:52.77,  it's obviously a fun group.
963,00:37:54.53,00:37:54.53,  This is not  a pleasant process...
964,00:37:56.30,00:37:56.30,"No, not at all."
965,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,"JEFF: And I know also, from listening"
966,00:37:59.20,00:37:59.20,"   to you guys talk,  that there are"
967,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,a lot of different reasons why you're here.
968,00:38:02.93,00:38:02.93,"Obviously, $1 million-- big motivator for anybody,"
969,00:38:05.27,00:38:05.27,but I'm sensing
970,00:38:06.40,00:38:06.40,"there could be personal reasons,"
971,00:38:08.20,00:38:08.20,different journeys you might be on
972,00:38:09.77,00:38:09.77,that-that this encompasses.
973,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,"Whatever it is,"
974,00:38:12.83,00:38:12.83,"to fulfill that agenda,"
975,00:38:14.10,00:38:14.10,you have to survive tonight's Tribal Council.
976,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,  That's the way it's set up.
977,00:38:18.27,00:38:18.27,"So, what we're going to do is vote"
978,00:38:20.57,00:38:20.57,and how it will work is
979,00:38:22.10,00:38:22.10,you'll come down here.
980,00:38:23.10,00:38:23.10,You'll go across this bridge
981,00:38:24.53,00:38:24.53,into our voting confessional.
982,00:38:26.17,00:38:26.17,  Write the name of the person  you want to vote off--
983,00:38:28.57,00:38:28.57," large, clear letters."
984,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,"  Hold it up,  and speak your piece."
985,00:38:31.30,00:38:31.30,   We can't hear you.
986,00:38:32.37,00:38:32.37,"Fold it up, put it in the container,"
987,00:38:34.53,00:38:34.53,"come back, and take a seat."
988,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,"Now, once the votes are tallied,  the decision is final"
989,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17, and you have to leave
990,00:38:41.70,00:38:41.70,the Tribal Council area immediately.
991,00:38:44.40,00:38:44.40,   It's time to vote.
992,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23, You're first.
993,00:39:10.03,00:39:10.03, Got to remove the weakest link in the... crew.
994,00:39:28.70,00:39:28.70,Stacey.
995,00:39:30.90,00:39:30.90," Um, tough call."
996,00:39:34.83,00:39:34.83,   ( sighs )
997,00:39:35.83,00:39:35.83,   Subtle reasons...
998,00:39:37.43,00:39:37.43,  I'm not sure  exactly what they are.
999,00:39:45.97,00:39:45.97,  He's just...
1000,00:39:46.97,00:39:46.97, He's an ornery guy...
1001,00:39:48.57,00:39:48.57, doesn't really help that much.
1002,00:39:51.03,00:39:51.03,"For a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know   how to start fire..."
1003,00:39:54.63,00:39:54.63, and he   just criticizes everything.
1004,00:40:01.47,00:40:01.47,I'm picking her
1005,00:40:02.97,00:40:02.97,because I think she's the reason    we lost yesterday.
1006,00:40:30.53,00:40:30.53,"   I'll miss his, uh, skills"
1007,00:40:33.30,00:40:33.30,"and, um,  his speaking his mind openly."
1008,00:40:49.50,00:40:49.50,"   Before I read these votes,    I just want to commend you"
1009,00:40:51.90,00:40:51.90,on the courage it's taken to get this far.
1010,00:40:54.33,00:40:54.33,There were a lot of steps along the way.
1011,00:40:56.70,00:40:56.70,Any of you could've turned around.
1012,00:40:58.53,00:40:58.53,"Nobody did, and in my book"
1013,00:41:00.17,00:41:00.17,that gives you bragging rights for life.
1014,00:41:02.50,00:41:02.50,"So, with that, I'll read the votes."
1015,00:41:07.20,00:41:07.20,  First vote-- Sonja.
1016,00:41:18.13,00:41:18.13, Sonja.
1017,00:41:25.23,00:41:25.23,Stacey.
1018,00:41:34.93,00:41:34.93, Sonja.
