143,00:07:11.43,00:07:11.43,RAMONA:I don't like being on the water all that much.
144,00:07:17.27,00:07:17.27,"  So, I mean, the whole motion   like this,"
145,00:07:19.90,00:07:19.90,"   and we're rowing,"
146,00:07:21.33,00:07:21.33,"  and we have like 100 pounds of stuff on the raft,"
147,00:07:24.07,00:07:24.07,"   I just, I started heaving."
148,00:07:26.30,00:07:26.30,Good job.Good job.

151,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,"  But this is, like, outdoors, 24-7,"
152,00:07:37.53,00:07:37.53,"  and you're exerting energy, like, almost all of that time."
153,00:07:43.53,00:07:43.53,"  Oh, my God."
154,00:07:45.90,00:07:45.90, This is just Day One.
155,00:07:53.47,00:07:53.47,"Should we, uh, you know, talk for a little bit,"
156,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17,   or should we start moving   stuff up?
157,00:07:57.90,00:07:57.90,"Hey, let's discuss some things,  man."
158,00:07:59.27,00:07:59.27, Let's figure some things out.
159,00:08:00.63,00:08:00.63,Here's what weplan on doing.
160,00:08:02.20,00:08:02.20,"High tide is thatline right there,see that line?"
161,00:08:04.13,00:08:04.13,"Yeah, uh-huh."
162,00:08:05.13,00:08:05.13,So it shouldn'tcome up to here.
163,00:08:06.90,00:08:06.90,"   And this piece of   bamboo back here,"
164,00:08:08.20,00:08:08.20,"  we can lay it from up here, over to there,"
165,00:08:10.13,00:08:10.13,  and that'll be the beginningof our shelter.
166,00:08:12.30,00:08:12.30,"Actually, beforewe build a shelter,"
167,00:08:14.00,00:08:14.00,just knock thatwhole branch off.
168,00:08:15.70,00:08:15.70,"No, I mean, thisis an awesome spot."
169,00:08:17.53,00:08:17.53,I'm just saying...
170,00:08:18.80,00:08:18.80,What's the first thingwe need to do?
171,00:08:20.77,00:08:20.77,Shelter.
172,00:08:20.77,00:08:20.77,We need a latrine.
173,00:08:22.23,00:08:22.23,"Okay, so we don't needfire tonight?"
174,00:08:24.17,00:08:24.17,That's an option.
175,00:08:25.50,00:08:25.50,We got enough waterto make it tonight.
176,00:08:27.27,00:08:27.27,"You guys, I think firstthing we ought to do"
177,00:08:29.47,00:08:29.47,is talk about howwe're going to do
178,00:08:31.47,00:08:31.47,whateverwe're going to do--
179,00:08:33.07,00:08:33.07,talk about the process.
180,00:08:34.47,00:08:34.47,"Listen, listen."

183,00:08:38.93,00:08:38.93, We'll clear these leaves off.
184,00:08:40.27,00:08:40.27, That's a flat piece of ground.
185,00:08:41.67,00:08:41.67,The latrine will be down there.
186,00:08:43.20,00:08:43.20, The wind's hitting me in the back right now.
187,00:08:45.27,00:08:45.27,"SEAN:So, we're sayingwe need a latrine"
188,00:08:47.50,00:08:47.50,"and a clear placeto sleep, is that all?"
189,00:08:49.43,00:08:49.43,Food.
190,00:08:50.77,00:08:50.77,And if we needmore...
191,00:08:52.37,00:08:52.37,"Let's check the box,before we makeany decisions."
192,00:08:54.33,00:08:54.33,Let's see what we got.
193,00:08:55.53,00:08:55.53,There might be ablowtorch in there.
194,00:08:58.33,00:08:58.33,We need a bathroom.

206,00:09:18.43,00:09:18.43,"I'm just thinking,"
207,00:09:19.83,00:09:19.83,I think we're offto a bad start.
208,00:09:21.47,00:09:21.47,"Why, 'causewe're not talking?"
209,00:09:23.10,00:09:23.10,Yeah.
210,00:09:24.10,00:09:24.10,"Sometimes, though,Richard, um,"
211,00:09:26.17,00:09:26.17,you kind of gotto do things
212,00:09:27.97,00:09:27.97,"and talkas you go along,"
213,00:09:29.53,00:09:29.53,and sometimes thingscan't be that planned out.
214,00:09:32.73,00:09:32.73,I agree with you.
215,00:09:34.13,00:09:34.13,"The problem with havingno conversation whatsoever,"
216,00:09:36.70,00:09:36.70,or lots of people talkingabout different things
217,00:09:39.17,00:09:39.17,is that nobody's workingtoward a particular goal.
218,00:09:41.83,00:09:41.83," Not the silly  little stuff about,"
219,00:09:43.43,00:09:43.43,"oh, who's goingto sleep where?"
220,00:09:45.17,00:09:45.17,  What are we  going to do?
221,00:09:46.23,00:09:46.23,  But why are we here?
222,00:09:47.23,00:09:47.23, And what's the point?
223,00:09:48.50,00:09:48.50,   And if we don't...
224,00:09:49.63,00:09:49.63,"Oh, I figured that outbefore I come here."
225,00:09:52.13,00:09:52.13,For you...
226,00:09:52.13,00:09:52.13,And you haven't?
227,00:09:53.87,00:09:53.87,"And I have for me,"
228,00:09:55.30,00:09:55.30,but we haven't for us.
229,00:09:56.70,00:09:56.70,"And for the nextseven ejections,"
230,00:09:58.57,00:09:58.57,"21 days, we have to function together,"
231,00:10:00.77,00:10:00.77,  or we fail.
232,00:10:01.97,00:10:01.97,What do you thinkwe're doing now?
233,00:10:03.70,00:10:03.70,Not functioningtogether at all.
234,00:10:05.20,00:10:05.20,"I'm a redneck, and I don't knowcorporate world at all,"
235,00:10:07.80,00:10:07.80,  and corporate world   ain't gonna work out here
236,00:10:09.70,00:10:09.70,  in the bush.
237,00:10:10.90,00:10:10.90,"No, I'm not talkingcorporate world."
238,00:10:12.60,00:10:12.60,I'm talkingcreating a team.
239,00:10:14.00,00:10:14.00, I thought we were doing good.
240,00:10:15.47,00:10:15.47,"   But, see, creating a team"
241,00:10:16.93,00:10:16.93,  is actually putting  all of our hands together...
242,00:10:19.73,00:10:19.73,"  Not hands, all of us knowing   what we're doing."
243,00:10:21.57,00:10:21.57,"Yeah, the hand thing,yeah, but that's..."
244,00:10:23.23,00:10:23.23," Action, man. Action, Richard."
245,00:10:24.97,00:10:24.97,Action.
246,00:10:26.43,00:10:26.43,"  Well, you don't want to act ahead."
247,00:10:29.17,00:10:29.17,RICHARD: I'm good to go survivalwise.
248,00:10:32.57,00:10:32.57," Peoplewise, it'll be   a little more challenging."
249,00:10:35.07,00:10:35.07,But I've got the million dollar check written already.
250,00:10:38.00,00:10:38.00," I mean, I'm the winner."
251,00:10:39.57,00:10:39.57,  And it's that kind of cocky  attitude that makes people
252,00:10:42.20,00:10:42.20, really hate your guts.
253,00:10:43.77,00:10:43.77,"  So that's the kind of thing, I've really got to keep, uh..."
254,00:10:46.93,00:10:46.93,  under wraps.
255,00:10:48.53,00:10:48.53,"  But, uh, it's just,  how do I get there from here?"
256,00:11:02.03,00:11:02.03,What's that?
257,00:11:03.13,00:11:03.13,"Whoa! Look at this, folks."
258,00:11:05.03,00:11:05.03,"If this is kerosene,and we didn't takeone of those lamps..."
259,00:11:08.90,00:11:08.90,We can make torchesand stuff out of twine.
260,00:11:11.13,00:11:11.13,We could twine allthe rafts together.
261,00:11:13.03,00:11:13.03,JOEL:What is that?
262,00:11:14.07,00:11:14.07,Biscuits.
263,00:11:15.13,00:11:15.13,"Yeah, it'sdefinitely biscuits,"
264,00:11:16.70,00:11:16.70,'cause we got corn...
265,00:11:18.00,00:11:18.00,"Well, look, wegot a frying pan."
266,00:11:19.47,00:11:19.47,"Oh, we are so set."
267,00:11:20.50,00:11:20.50,"Look, I'm shaking it."
268,00:11:21.53,00:11:21.53,Can anyone hearthe biscuits?
269,00:11:23.17,00:11:23.17," Oh, ho, we got  a team flag."
270,00:11:24.73,00:11:24.73,Whoo-hoo!
271,00:11:26.30,00:11:26.30,"If that's our latrine,"
272,00:11:27.60,00:11:27.60,"I say wedig a hole,"
273,00:11:28.60,00:11:28.60,"put this here,knock a board"
274,00:11:29.93,00:11:29.93,"out of the bottom,then we can keep"
275,00:11:31.47,00:11:31.47,moving it across.
276,00:11:32.47,00:11:32.47,Let's plug the hole.
277,00:11:34.23,00:11:34.23, SEAN:Let's sit down and talk  about what the hell
278,00:11:36.40,00:11:36.40,   we're going to do.
279,00:11:37.43,00:11:37.43,RICHARD:  Can I help?
280,00:11:38.90,00:11:38.90,"  When I asked earlier  about having a conversation,"
281,00:11:40.80,00:11:40.80,"that's what I was talking about,"
282,00:11:42.53,00:11:42.53, and I really can helpwith how we can do this.
283,00:11:44.77,00:11:44.77,We wanted to see...
284,00:11:45.97,00:11:45.97,"  You guys, we came over hereto talk."
285,00:11:47.53,00:11:47.53,We just wantto see what we...
286,00:11:49.20,00:11:49.20,RICHARD:  What happens when people get together is
287,00:11:51.33,00:11:51.33,"   if they aren't all headed in the same direction,"
288,00:11:53.70,00:11:53.70,"   toward a particular goal,then things that individuals do"
289,00:11:57.67,00:11:57.67," kind of get in the way of the whole team, and I think"
290,00:12:01.27,00:12:01.27," it's really, really important  that what we decide"
291,00:12:04.20,00:12:04.20, be decided as a group.
292,00:12:05.67,00:12:05.67,"So, if you hear somebodysaying something"
293,00:12:07.93,00:12:07.93,"   and you're all aggravatedwith them, stop,"
294,00:12:09.57,00:12:09.57,  don't try to make your point
295,00:12:10.93,00:12:10.93, and try and help them  make theirs.
296,00:12:12.20,00:12:12.20,"So, for example,you know, Sean,"
297,00:12:14.27,00:12:14.27,what do you thinka main point
298,00:12:16.17,00:12:16.17,of what I'm tryingto say now is?
299,00:12:18.13,00:12:18.13,I didn't listen to a word you...
300,00:12:19.80,00:12:19.80,"I've been daydreaming, thinking,   ""What am I going to eat?"""

302,00:12:42.03,00:12:42.03,"All right, wegot a stick up."
303,00:12:45.50,00:12:45.50,"Well, as long as they canhit the middle of this hole,"
304,00:12:48.03,00:12:48.03,we're all set here.
305,00:12:49.10,00:12:49.10,Put it right like this.
306,00:12:50.17,00:12:50.17,This is perfect.
307,00:12:58.63,00:12:58.63,"Hey, we found a water map!"
308,00:13:00.43,00:13:00.43,You got it?
309,00:13:01.67,00:13:01.67,  We got a water map.

314,00:13:09.57,00:13:09.57,We go backto the other stream down there
315,00:13:12.27,00:13:12.27,and then we getthe water here.
316,00:13:14.60,00:13:14.60, B.B.:Here's where we are right here.
317,00:13:16.93,00:13:16.93,We have to goacross the stream.

382,00:15:52.73,00:15:52.73, RUDY:  The hardest part
383,00:15:54.27,00:15:54.27,  is hanging around   with all these young kids.
384,00:15:56.10,00:15:56.10,"   I don't even know   what MTV means, you know?"
385,00:15:59.30,00:15:59.30, And I'm used to being in the military
386,00:16:01.83,00:16:01.83," and one guy stands up,    he gives an order"
387,00:16:04.10,00:16:04.10,  and there's no back talk.
388,00:16:05.77,00:16:05.77,"   You know, like yesterday,"
389,00:16:07.57,00:16:07.57,   everybody's tryingto run the show
390,00:16:10.03,00:16:10.03,"   and if they'd let   one person do it,"
391,00:16:12.03,00:16:12.03,we'd be much better off.
392,00:16:13.80,00:16:13.80,  But trying to keep them allshut up is hard.
393,00:16:16.70,00:16:16.70," If they listen to me,"
394,00:16:18.33,00:16:18.33,"  they'd all have haircuts and everything else, you know."
395,00:16:20.87,00:16:20.87, We'd be in formation in the morning
396,00:16:23.03,00:16:23.03,"  and all that kind of stuff,"
397,00:16:25.03,00:16:25.03, but they're not    going to do that.
398,00:16:27.23,00:16:27.23,"  I got to fit in, not them."
399,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33," You know, there's more of them  than there is of me."
400,00:16:31.53,00:16:31.53,"Hey, you gota pierced nipple, eh?"
401,00:16:33.77,00:16:33.77,Yeah. I got the ol'pierced nipple thing.
402,00:16:36.20,00:16:36.20,How did that feel?
403,00:16:37.37,00:16:37.37,"Pretty edgy fora doctor, right?"
404,00:16:39.37,00:16:39.37,"Yeah, yeah."
405,00:16:40.83,00:16:40.83,   I thought I was making it with the hair
406,00:16:42.27,00:16:42.27," and then this morning,"
407,00:16:43.27,00:16:43.27, when I ran my hand through it
408,00:16:45.03,00:16:45.03," and felt these coupleof golf ball-sized knots in it,"
409,00:16:48.10,00:16:48.10," I'm like, no, they gotto come out now."
410,00:16:53.53,00:16:53.53,SONJA:I was doing something.
411,00:16:55.47,00:16:55.47,I don't even rememberhow I did it.
412,00:16:57.07,00:16:57.07,"Betadine won't hurt it,yeah, so we'll give it"
413,00:16:59.30,00:16:59.30,   a little shot of Betadine.
414,00:17:00.47,00:17:00.47,"I think these arethe only sponges we have,"
415,00:17:02.53,00:17:02.53,so I'm just goingto keep reusing them.
416,00:17:04.50,00:17:04.50,Okay.
417,00:17:06.30,00:17:06.30," SONJA:  I've been thrashing around  like I'm 35,"
418,00:17:08.30,00:17:08.30,"  instead of acting my age,"
419,00:17:10.60,00:17:10.60, but we have a doctor
420,00:17:12.33,00:17:12.33,"   in our tribe-- uh, Sean--   and he did a wonderful job"
421,00:17:16.23,00:17:16.23,  of bandaging me up.
422,00:17:18.30,00:17:18.30,  I think one of the problems   with aging
423,00:17:20.63,00:17:20.63," is the thinning of the skin,    darn it,"
424,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,and so I think I'm maybegetting a little more banged up
425,00:17:25.53,00:17:25.53, than some of the younger ones.
426,00:17:30.00,00:17:30.00,"My aim leaves somethingto be desired,"
427,00:17:31.33,00:17:31.33,but we're getting there.
428,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,Try this?
429,00:17:33.97,00:17:33.97,"Well, I don't know."
430,00:17:35.17,00:17:35.17,This is heavier.
431,00:17:37.17,00:17:37.17,"It might besharper, though."
432,00:17:38.53,00:17:38.53,Think so?
433,00:17:39.90,00:17:39.90,I'm wondering 'causethat's so damn hard.
434,00:17:42.13,00:17:42.13,"Well, that's off."
435,00:17:43.13,00:17:43.13,That ain't gonna work.
436,00:17:44.63,00:17:44.63,"  Here's a, uh, a therapist's version of ""Bye, Bye, Blues,"""
437,00:17:48.07,00:17:48.07, if I can remember it.

448,00:18:21.73,00:18:21.73,   Fantastic.
449,00:18:28.20,00:18:28.20,"RICHARD: Well, the fish traps   were hanging from the boat"
450,00:18:30.87,00:18:30.87," that we were coming over here,"
451,00:18:32.53,00:18:32.53,  and when we weretossed into the sea on the raft
452,00:18:34.93,00:18:34.93,"  and we could take whatever   we could get our hands on,"
453,00:18:37.43,00:18:37.43,  we grabbed    three or four fish traps
454,00:18:39.13,00:18:39.13,"  and a bunch of rat traps,"
455,00:18:40.63,00:18:40.63, and so we stuck the rat traps  out the first night
456,00:18:42.77,00:18:42.77,and boom-- we got a ratin each of them.
457,00:18:47.93,00:18:47.93,Bait. I want bait!
458,00:18:49.00,00:18:49.00,Give me bait!
459,00:18:55.67,00:18:55.67,I think he's just goingto cut its head off.
460,00:19:00.20,00:19:00.20,Ew!
461,00:19:01.40,00:19:01.40,"Oh, God!"
462,00:19:02.47,00:19:02.47,"Oh, no way!"
463,00:19:04.30,00:19:04.30,( laughing )
464,00:19:07.93,00:19:07.93,Remember that knife.
465,00:19:09.00,00:19:09.00,We're not using itfor anything else.
466,00:19:11.93,00:19:11.93,"Oh, dude!"
467,00:19:16.00,00:19:16.00,RAMONA: I didn't sleep at all.
468,00:19:17.90,00:19:17.90," I mean, we-we closed our eyes."
469,00:19:19.83,00:19:19.83, We kept hearing noises
470,00:19:21.40,00:19:21.40,"  and, like, clicking sounds, and we're, like, okay."
471,00:19:24.60,00:19:24.60," Um, what's his name..."
472,00:19:25.87,00:19:25.87,WOMAN::Joel.
473,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,"   Uh, Joel woke up,  a rat was, like, in his ear."
474,00:19:30.27,00:19:30.27, JOEL:  I heard something squeaking   in my ear.
475,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,"  A rat was trying   to get on the raft,"
476,00:19:33.63,00:19:33.63, or get near us  or get at something.
477,00:19:35.30,00:19:35.30," I mean, everything was moving."
478,00:19:38.90,00:19:38.90, B.B.:  We're just going  along the beach here
479,00:19:41.13,00:19:41.13, and just identifying  whatever we can use
480,00:19:43.47,00:19:43.47,"  for the shelter, the roof."
481,00:19:45.47,00:19:45.47,  And I'm a little irritated
482,00:19:48.13,00:19:48.13,that none of the others
483,00:19:49.63,00:19:49.63," are down here to help carry stuff, but that's okay."
484,00:19:52.10,00:19:52.10,   We need...  we need five more of these.
485,00:19:55.97,00:19:55.97,B.B....
486,00:19:57.53,00:19:57.53," He's a character, man."
487,00:19:59.30,00:19:59.30,I don't think he likes me much.
488,00:20:01.90,00:20:01.90,Just these.
489,00:20:03.17,00:20:03.17,"No, no, you don't understand."
490,00:20:04.60,00:20:04.60, I got to have this thought out and positioned right.
491,00:20:07.67,00:20:07.67,"GRETCHEN:He's right, Joel,"
492,00:20:09.17,00:20:09.17,or it's not goingto fit the frame.
493,00:20:11.03,00:20:11.03,"Joel, trust me."
494,00:20:12.03,00:20:12.03,I'm not theone bitching.
495,00:20:13.57,00:20:13.57,"   I mean, I'm fine."
496,00:20:17.63,00:20:17.63,"Hey, don't betalking to me"
497,00:20:18.97,00:20:18.97,about monkeybusiness.
498,00:20:19.97,00:20:19.97,"I can't sleep,so I'm usually up."
499,00:20:23.10,00:20:23.10,...this being the width.
500,00:20:46.53,00:20:46.53, B.B.:  We got a lot of lazy people
501,00:20:48.47,00:20:48.47, if you want to know the truth.
502,00:20:49.80,00:20:49.80, You can't do it all yourself.
503,00:20:51.87,00:20:51.87,"   You know, I asked Colleen to straighten this out for me"
504,00:20:54.90,00:20:54.90,and here it is.
505,00:20:56.40,00:20:56.40, That's the only thing  she had to do today.
506,00:20:58.53,00:20:58.53,  You can't have lazy people.
507,00:21:00.63,00:21:00.63,"   GRETCHEN: He had been out there,   you know, all morning long"
508,00:21:03.20,00:21:03.20,"  and, um... you know,  it was hot."
509,00:21:06.47,00:21:06.47,"GRETCHEN:B.B., I thought we saidthat this was a time of day,"
510,00:21:10.30,00:21:10.30,we were going to beout of the sun.
511,00:21:12.40,00:21:12.40,"  Well, but for some of us...  some of the people,"
512,00:21:14.73,00:21:14.73,  it's been all day that way.
513,00:21:16.20,00:21:16.20,"Right,it's your turn."
514,00:21:17.67,00:21:17.67,You tell mewhat you're doing here
515,00:21:20.00,00:21:20.00,and I'll help you.
516,00:21:21.30,00:21:21.30,You hold it up
517,00:21:22.30,00:21:22.30,and I'll do it quick.
518,00:21:23.37,00:21:23.37,"I promise you,I'll do it quick."
519,00:21:25.10,00:21:25.10,"That, you know,"
520,00:21:26.60,00:21:26.60,"that's the rightway to do it,"
521,00:21:28.00,00:21:28.00,but we won't havenear enough line
522,00:21:29.50,00:21:29.50,to build the roofand do that
523,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,"if we do all this,"
524,00:21:31.67,00:21:31.67,in all fairness.
525,00:21:33.10,00:21:33.10,"Anyway, don'tstop now, but..."
526,00:21:35.70,00:21:35.70,"I think we'll have plenty,"
527,00:21:37.97,00:21:37.97,"and I'm going to roll that upfor you, too."
528,00:21:41.77,00:21:41.77,"We can't, like,get burned out, though."
529,00:21:43.70,00:21:43.70,I'm not burned out.
530,00:21:44.70,00:21:44.70,"I know,but you will be"
531,00:21:45.90,00:21:45.90,if you spend all dayout in the sun.
532,00:21:47.53,00:21:47.53,"No, I neverget burned out."
533,00:21:48.87,00:21:48.87,You don't know me.
534,00:21:49.97,00:21:49.97,"I don't know you,but I know human beings."
535,00:21:51.73,00:21:51.73,Okay.
536,00:21:52.87,00:21:52.87,I like workingas a hobby.
537,00:21:54.03,00:21:54.03,"Honest to God,how about 15 minutes though?"
538,00:21:55.90,00:21:55.90,Sit down for 15 minutes.
539,00:21:57.00,00:21:57.00,"Why? Yeah, but,I want to get..."
540,00:21:58.53,00:21:58.53,I want to get this thingstabilized so at least...
541,00:22:00.70,00:22:00.70,"But, B.B., look..."
542,00:22:02.50,00:22:02.50,  Let me just explain.
543,00:22:03.97,00:22:03.97,I want to get this stabilized sothen people can come in here...
544,00:22:07.37,00:22:07.37,You know the light cordsyou got?
545,00:22:09.17,00:22:09.17," And we can tie   these things down,"
546,00:22:10.70,00:22:10.70,  but until I get this bounce out of this...
547,00:22:12.80,00:22:12.80, I want to... I'm going to puta support there
548,00:22:15.17,00:22:15.17,in the middle hereand right there.
549,00:22:19.00,00:22:19.00,"'Cause if not, wegot to take bounceout of this."
550,00:22:20.93,00:22:20.93,I just think we haveplenty of time.
551,00:22:22.63,00:22:22.63,"I thought we were goingto try to stay competitive,"
552,00:22:25.03,00:22:25.03,and if you work all day
553,00:22:26.03,00:22:26.03,"and you're burntat the end of the day,"
554,00:22:27.47,00:22:27.47,we're not going to becompetitive.
555,00:22:29.03,00:22:29.03,"Take a break, and if it bouncesa little tonight,"
556,00:22:30.57,00:22:30.57,then we'll fix it tomorrow.
557,00:22:32.67,00:22:32.67,"   I'm going to keep working,  sweetheart."
558,00:22:34.67,00:22:34.67,You're going to getburned out.
559,00:22:35.67,00:22:35.67,"No, I'm not."
560,00:22:36.67,00:22:36.67,"Yeah, you are."
561,00:22:37.67,00:22:37.67,You already are.
562,00:22:51.47,00:22:51.47," B.B.:Oh, my."
563,00:22:59.83,00:22:59.83,You're doing fine.
564,00:23:00.90,00:23:00.90,Too much paper.
565,00:23:01.90,00:23:01.90,Yeah.
566,00:23:04.03,00:23:04.03, Bifocals work?
567,00:23:05.73,00:23:05.73,Bifocals worked.
568,00:23:07.70,00:23:07.70,"You the man, B."
569,00:23:08.90,00:23:08.90,"No, she tookmy bifocals..."
570,00:23:10.73,00:23:10.73,We're both the man.
571,00:23:12.17,00:23:12.17,And made it happen.
572,00:23:13.53,00:23:13.53, B.B.: And the fire started
573,00:23:15.57,00:23:15.57, because I had bought    a set of glasses with me.
574,00:23:19.07,00:23:19.07,  I was going to do it
575,00:23:20.57,00:23:20.57,"  and Gretchen said,  ""Why don't I do it?"
576,00:23:22.53,00:23:22.53,"   I know how to do it, too.""  So, I said, ""Great."""
577,00:23:24.60,00:23:24.60,"  Nice, guys. You guyssplit up and everything."
578,00:23:26.47,00:23:26.47,Amen.
579,00:23:26.47,00:23:26.47,Good work.
580,00:23:27.70,00:23:27.70, B.B.: And she took my glasses
581,00:23:28.90,00:23:28.90, and started the fire.
582,00:23:31.13,00:23:31.13," You did well, Gretch."
583,00:23:36.00,00:23:36.00,"If we get fire,"
584,00:23:37.63,00:23:37.63,  it means we're going to have   a hot meal in our stomach
585,00:23:40.80,00:23:40.80,   which is going to bring up  team morale.
586,00:23:42.93,00:23:42.93,"That first meal   might be rat soup,"
587,00:23:44.67,00:23:44.67,"which I'm, like,  looking forward to very much"
588,00:23:47.23,00:23:47.23, because there's nothing wrong  with a rat.
589,00:23:49.57,00:23:49.57,"  All a rat is, is a squirrel without a fuzzy tail."
590,00:23:52.37,00:23:52.37,   Let's just work with this.
591,00:23:54.07,00:23:54.07,Okay.
592,00:23:55.43,00:23:55.43," I'm thinking,  if we could work with this,"
593,00:23:57.20,00:23:57.20,we're gettinga ton of smoke.
594,00:23:59.27,00:23:59.27,Start thatpiece of wood?
595,00:23:59.27,00:23:59.27,"  If we get a piece of bamboo,"
596,00:24:01.63,00:24:01.63,  someone sits here and holds the bamboo right here
597,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73,with the kindling in it.
598,00:24:03.73,00:24:03.73,With the kindlingin it.
599,00:24:05.87,00:24:05.87,   You know what I'm saying?
600,00:24:07.13,00:24:07.13,Here we go.
601,00:24:15.07,00:24:15.07," Come on, Dirk."
602,00:24:18.60,00:24:18.60,Go big.
603,00:24:19.70,00:24:19.70,This isn'tgoing to catch.
604,00:24:24.97,00:24:24.97," Well, you want  to just keep trying?"
605,00:24:27.10,00:24:27.10,Why don't we tryand make the bough?
606,00:24:29.23,00:24:29.23,  MAN: Go...!
607,00:24:31.30,00:24:31.30,Come on!  We're getting there!
608,00:24:32.60,00:24:32.60,All right! Okay!
609,00:24:34.20,00:24:34.20,Don't stop!Don't stop!
610,00:24:36.20,00:24:36.20,There was smoke.We lost it.
611,00:24:38.50,00:24:38.50,A lot of smoke.
612,00:24:38.50,00:24:38.50,Yeah.
613,00:24:39.53,00:24:39.53,   Don't you guys...
614,00:24:40.53,00:24:40.53,Cool!
615,00:24:42.83,00:24:42.83,   How much more do we need?
616,00:24:43.83,00:24:43.83,I don't know.
617,00:24:44.90,00:24:44.90, How much more?
618,00:24:45.90,00:24:45.90, That'll do it.
619,00:24:46.90,00:24:46.90," You in, Rich?"
620,00:24:48.00,00:24:48.00,Here we go.Here we go.
621,00:24:49.80,00:24:49.80,"Work it, Rich."
622,00:24:51.07,00:24:51.07,Yeah.
623,00:24:52.13,00:24:52.13,What?
624,00:24:53.13,00:24:53.13,You guys get readyto take his spot.
625,00:24:56.60,00:24:56.60,"Take a break, man."
626,00:24:57.93,00:24:57.93,We made a lot smoke but no fire.
627,00:25:00.20,00:25:00.20,"I think it would have been nice if we had fire,"
628,00:25:02.53,00:25:02.53,  but we're not going  to catch fish
629,00:25:03.97,00:25:03.97, unless we have fire to cook it
630,00:25:05.83,00:25:05.83,"  and I think that    if we had fire,"
631,00:25:07.27,00:25:07.27,  we could have spent  a lot of time sitting
632,00:25:09.80,00:25:09.80,   around the bonfire at night maybe singing songs.
633,00:25:11.77,00:25:11.77,"  We have a ukulele, you know,"
634,00:25:13.27,00:25:13.27, and that didn't happen   and I wish it did.
635,00:25:14.87,00:25:14.87," Throughout their time on the island,"
636,00:25:17.13,00:25:17.13,the tribes will compete   in a series of challenges.
637,00:25:20.17,00:25:20.17,They'll receive messages
638,00:25:21.80,00:25:21.80, notifying them of these competitions
639,00:25:24.07,00:25:24.07,  at their tree mail.
640,00:25:25.47,00:25:25.47,"  Today's challenge isfor both reward,"
641,00:25:27.77,00:25:27.77,"  in the form of 50 waterproof matches, and immunity."
642,00:25:31.13,00:25:31.13," Win immunity, you stayon the island a few days longer."
643,00:25:34.97,00:25:34.97,"   Lose, face Tribal Council,"
644,00:25:36.67,00:25:36.67, where you must vote one memberoff the island.
645,00:25:48.40,00:25:48.40,Ooh.
646,00:25:51.93,00:25:51.93,A map to fire.
647,00:25:53.30,00:25:53.30,It's got to be.
648,00:25:54.80,00:25:54.80,"""Cold food, dark camp,"
649,00:25:56.27,00:25:56.27,"""just a reminderof your first night."
650,00:25:58.80,00:25:58.80,"It looks so easyin the book."" Yes."
651,00:26:01.27,00:26:01.27,"""Why is it so hard to light?"
652,00:26:03.33,00:26:03.33,"""Tonight your tribewill carry the torch."
653,00:26:05.57,00:26:05.57,"""One tribe takeshome the flame."
654,00:26:07.93,00:26:07.93,"The other givessomeone the boot."""
655,00:26:10.77,00:26:10.77, Whoa!
656,00:26:12.10,00:26:12.10,Whoa.
657,00:26:13.47,00:26:13.47,I guess they'recombining the reward
658,00:26:15.13,00:26:15.13, and immunity challenge   this time.
659,00:26:16.67,00:26:16.67," That's the competition   is taking home the flame,"
660,00:26:18.67,00:26:18.67,  but what's the competition?  We've got no freakin' idea.
661,00:26:34.00,00:26:34.00,"Welcome, tribes,to your first challenge."
662,00:26:36.43,00:26:36.43,Congratulations  on your first night
663,00:26:38.43,00:26:38.43,on the island-- should be very proud.
664,00:26:40.60,00:26:40.60,I know both ofyou guys have food.
665,00:26:42.60,00:26:42.60,You found somefresh water
666,00:26:44.50,00:26:44.50,"and I think, Pagong,you guys had fire."
667,00:26:47.10,00:26:47.10,   ( cheers )
668,00:26:48.10,00:26:48.10,Right on.
669,00:26:49.17,00:26:49.17,   A lot of work to get fire.
670,00:26:50.33,00:26:50.33,Yeah.
671,00:26:51.33,00:26:51.33,"Yeah, it takesa lot of work."
672,00:26:53.00,00:26:53.00,"With the threat of rainalways a constant,"
673,00:26:54.63,00:26:54.63,"even if you guysdid have fire,"
674,00:26:56.17,00:26:56.17,you're certainly not back there  tending to them now.
675,00:26:58.43,00:26:58.43, 50 waterproof matches   should certainly make that
676,00:27:00.53,00:27:00.53,a lot easier.
677,00:27:01.53,00:27:01.53,It's one of the things
678,00:27:03.40,00:27:03.40,you're playingfor tonight-- theother is this:
679,00:27:05.47,00:27:05.47,"I want everybody to touch this,get a good feel of this."
680,00:27:07.97,00:27:07.97,   This is your life on the island.
681,00:27:09.60,00:27:09.60,   This is the immunity idol.
682,00:27:11.00,00:27:11.00,Oh. Ah.
683,00:27:12.13,00:27:12.13,"   Win this,"
684,00:27:13.20,00:27:13.20,you stay onthe island afew days longer.
685,00:27:15.13,00:27:15.13,Lose...
686,00:27:16.37,00:27:16.37,"you face   tomorrow's Tribal Council,"
687,00:27:18.23,00:27:18.23,where one ofyou will be
688,00:27:19.60,00:27:19.60,the first personvoted off the island.
689,00:27:21.57,00:27:21.57,   Big enough stakes?
690,00:27:22.57,00:27:22.57,"Oh, yeah."
691,00:27:23.57,00:27:23.57," Okay, here's what we're doing."
692,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,  There are two rafts
693,00:27:26.50,00:27:26.50,about 150 feetout in the water.
694,00:27:28.17,00:27:28.17,  Your job is to get your raft   back to the beach.
695,00:27:31.43,00:27:31.43,"Along the way, a series  of torches both in the water"
696,00:27:33.83,00:27:33.83,and on the land.
697,00:27:35.33,00:27:35.33,  First team to light   all their torches
698,00:27:37.03,00:27:37.03,   and their side of the fire spirit wins immunity.
699,00:27:39.63,00:27:39.63,Here are the rules:Each tribe member
700,00:27:41.63,00:27:41.63,has to have onehand on the raft
701,00:27:43.50,00:27:43.50,at all times--at all times.
702,00:27:45.40,00:27:45.40,Nobody canswim ahead.
703,00:27:46.67,00:27:46.67,Nobody can fall behind.
704,00:27:47.90,00:27:47.90,The other rule: you haveto light every torch.
705,00:27:50.00,00:27:50.00,  Don't put me in the position
706,00:27:51.47,00:27:51.47,   of having to make   a judgment call.
707,00:27:52.77,00:27:52.77,I don't want to.   There's too much at stake.
708,00:27:54.43,00:27:54.43,Clear?
709,00:27:55.47,00:27:55.47,  ALL: Clear.
710,00:27:56.47,00:27:56.47,"All right,swim out to your rafts."
711,00:27:58.40,00:27:58.40,Wait for my signal.
712,00:28:08.57,00:28:08.57," Okay, Sue, listen up."
713,00:28:10.33,00:28:10.33,   You're going to hold this.
714,00:28:13.10,00:28:13.10,How's that feelfor you carrying?

803,00:31:48.23,00:31:48.23,I think he'spretty religious.
804,00:31:49.70,00:31:49.70,He was telling me he was a youth minister or something.
805,00:31:52.63,00:31:52.63,  ( reading quietly )
806,00:32:12.13,00:32:12.13,Rain's coming.

811,00:32:20.67,00:32:20.67,"  I formed opinions  about people,"
812,00:32:22.90,00:32:22.90, but I changed my mind just on that trip in.
813,00:32:25.70,00:32:25.70," Rich, for one."
814,00:32:27.00,00:32:27.00," I mean, this guy is...  He's strong."

816,00:32:30.30,00:32:30.30, The guy surprises me.
817,00:32:31.87,00:32:31.87,"You know, he's fat, but he's..."
818,00:32:34.10,00:32:34.10, ( chuckling ):   he's good.

821,00:32:37.87,00:32:37.87,  I'm not bothered
822,00:32:39.03,00:32:39.03,  by his straightforwardness at all.
823,00:32:40.27,00:32:40.27, I don't think
824,00:32:41.33,00:32:41.33,  it's even a problem.
825,00:32:42.33,00:32:42.33,  I-I like it that he's saying
826,00:32:43.63,00:32:43.63,"""Hey, do this,""  or, ""Hey, do that,"""
827,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,but people are thinking of that  as very direct and arrogant.
828,00:32:47.60,00:32:47.60," That's the word I'm hearing,   and I'm thinking to myself"
829,00:32:50.03,00:32:50.03,"""Well, they think he's arrogant; Oh, my God, I'm out of here!"""
830,00:32:56.07,00:32:56.07,   ( thuds )
831,00:33:02.60,00:33:02.60,"  Oh, my gosh."
832,00:33:04.17,00:33:04.17,What do we got?
833,00:33:05.53,00:33:05.53,The good news is we'll be having fire tonight.
834,00:33:08.63,00:33:08.63,The bad news isone of us won't behere to enjoy it.
835,00:33:11.30,00:33:11.30, We got Tribal Council tonight.
836,00:33:12.60,00:33:12.60,"""Pack your bags,get ready to go,"
837,00:33:14.07,00:33:14.07,"which one it will be,the world will soon know."""
838,00:33:16.40,00:33:16.40,"KELLY:  Unfortunately, we're going  to have to vote somebody off."
839,00:33:19.60,00:33:19.60,  There's going to bea lot of tension
840,00:33:21.23,00:33:21.23,and one of us is going to leave.
841,00:33:23.10,00:33:23.10,"Well, what time wegot to do this at?"
842,00:33:25.60,00:33:25.60,"It just said,""Get ready to go."""
843,00:33:28.23,00:33:28.23," Just, ""Pack your bags,    get ready to go."""
844,00:33:32.77,00:33:32.77,I can't believe  we have to pack up.
845,00:33:34.93,00:33:34.93,  We're just getting settled.
846,00:33:36.80,00:33:36.80," Well, somebody's gone."
847,00:33:38.00,00:33:38.00," So, it's time to think"
848,00:33:39.40,00:33:39.40,  about who are they going  to vote for?
849,00:33:41.07,00:33:41.07,  Why are they going to vote?
850,00:33:42.57,00:33:42.57, I've narrowed it down to four.
851,00:33:44.10,00:33:44.10,I'm one of them.
852,00:33:46.33,00:33:46.33,"   Well, it could mean a lot"
853,00:33:47.90,00:33:47.90,"  uh, either staying  or being voted out."
854,00:33:50.03,00:33:50.03,"  You know,    last night's competition,"
855,00:33:52.23,00:33:52.23,  I really feel responsible   because I couldn't keep up
856,00:33:55.93,00:33:55.93,  and I was dragged totally  off my feet.
857,00:33:58.67,00:33:58.67,  I do feel that that stumble    probably cost us
858,00:34:01.70,00:34:01.70,"the immunity challenge, and that's a big one."
859,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27," Up until, uh,  probably last night,"
860,00:34:06.47,00:34:06.47,I never gave ita second thought
861,00:34:08.77,00:34:08.77, about who I was going  to vote off
862,00:34:11.00,00:34:11.00," or if I got voted off,  but after last night, uh..."
863,00:34:14.37,00:34:14.37,"  I thought about it then,   and I decided then."
864,00:34:18.37,00:34:18.37,"I feel pretty secure, actually,about the vote tonight."
865,00:34:21.23,00:34:21.23, Kelly and I get along    real well
866,00:34:23.23,00:34:23.23, and we've been talking
867,00:34:24.80,00:34:24.80," about strategy, and, you know, who's not contributing"
868,00:34:27.23,00:34:27.23," as much, and who would be best  to vote off,"
869,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,   and I think we-we've come  to a mutual decision
870,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50,and we've talked to Sue   about it.
871,00:34:34.43,00:34:34.43," Stacey came up to me,and it's, like,"
872,00:34:37.20,00:34:37.20,  she don't like Rudy
873,00:34:38.70,00:34:38.70,"  and she's, like,"
874,00:34:40.20,00:34:40.20,"  ""Oh, I think we're going   to vote for Rudy,"""
875,00:34:42.23,00:34:42.23,"  and vote him off    'cause he's so barking."""
876,00:34:43.97,00:34:43.97,"  Well, anybody's too barking and too bossy to Stacey"
877,00:34:46.63,00:34:46.63,  because she doesn't  move her ass.
878,00:34:48.37,00:34:48.37,"  The chicks think I'm voting  for one person, and I'm not."
879,00:34:59.77,00:34:59.77,"This is Tribal Council,where each week"
880,00:35:02.50,00:35:02.50,one member will be votedoff the island.
881,00:35:05.30,00:35:05.30,"  Last night,  in a crushing defeat"
882,00:35:07.40,00:35:07.40," Tagi lost the immunity   challenge,"
883,00:35:09.33,00:35:09.33,"so, tonight, they will come here and vote the first person off."
884,00:35:13.60,00:35:13.60, It all begins  with a dangerous hike
885,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,  through the jungle.
886,00:35:20.43,00:35:20.43,"  With so little time   to get acquainted,"
887,00:35:22.67,00:35:22.67, everyone is vulnerable.
888,00:35:26.10,00:35:26.10,  Rich's talk-versus-action    approach
889,00:35:28.07,00:35:28.07, may be more annoying  than helpful.
890,00:35:32.60,00:35:32.60, Sonja's tumble    cost them dearly.
891,00:35:35.73,00:35:35.73,  One thing's for certain:
892,00:35:37.73,00:35:37.73,"  At Tribal Council,    you are held accountable"
893,00:35:40.87,00:35:40.87,  for your actions.
894,00:35:41.87,00:35:41.87, There will be a vote.
895,00:35:43.20,00:35:43.20, Someone is going home.
896,00:35:44.90,00:35:44.90, I see torches.
897,00:35:46.60,00:35:46.60,"Oh, that lookspretty hairy."
898,00:35:48.50,00:35:48.50,   ( birds chirping )
899,00:35:53.40,00:35:53.40,( gong sounds )
900,00:35:55.07,00:35:55.07,  Make our way around.
901,00:36:09.73,00:36:09.73,We beginTribal Council
902,00:36:11.23,00:36:11.23, with a ritual.
903,00:36:12.23,00:36:12.23, Behind each of you is a torch.
904,00:36:14.13,00:36:14.13, I'd like you to grab the torch and approach the fire.
905,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43,Go ahead anddip your torches
906,00:36:19.83,00:36:19.83,in the flameand light them.
907,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,"Put them back in theirslot, and take a seat."
908,00:36:24.60,00:36:24.60,We do this because--
909,00:36:25.90,00:36:25.90,as I'm sureyou've discovered--
910,00:36:28.57,00:36:28.57," on the island, fire represents life."
911,00:36:30.13,00:36:30.13,"  These torches now representyour life, your identity"
912,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,here atTribal Council.
913,00:36:33.90,00:36:33.90,The good news is
914,00:36:35.43,00:36:35.43,  you will take these torcheswith you when you leave
915,00:36:37.53,00:36:37.53," so you will have fire,"
916,00:36:38.77,00:36:38.77,and you will bring them back with you
917,00:36:40.23,00:36:40.23,to each Tribal Council.
918,00:36:41.40,00:36:41.40,Go ahead andhave a seat.
919,00:36:42.83,00:36:42.83,"Well, leave it to meto state the obvious,"
920,00:36:45.27,00:36:45.27,but this is not aplace you want to be.
921,00:36:47.60,00:36:47.60,You tread in dangerous territory   every time you come here.
922,00:36:50.73,00:36:50.73,Tribal Councilis basically
923,00:36:52.27,00:36:52.27,where you accountfor your actionson the island.
924,00:36:54.43,00:36:54.43,Some ofthose actions
925,00:36:56.23,00:36:56.23,will come backto help you.
926,00:36:57.77,00:36:57.77,"Some of them may comeback to haunt you,"
927,00:36:59.97,00:36:59.97,"but tonight, basedon those actions,"
928,00:37:01.67,00:37:01.67,one of you will bethe first personvoted off the island.
929,00:37:03.90,00:37:03.90,"So, before weget to the vote,"
930,00:37:06.23,00:37:06.23,let's talk about what's been going on.
931,00:37:07.97,00:37:07.97,  I'm curiousjust about you guys getting here
932,00:37:09.90,00:37:09.90,and finding this place.
933,00:37:11.07,00:37:11.07,How was thejourney over here?
934,00:37:13.03,00:37:13.03, Saw two deadly snakes.
935,00:37:14.03,00:37:14.03,Really?
936,00:37:15.03,00:37:15.03,SUSAN:Grand Canyon
937,00:37:16.23,00:37:16.23, mud slides...
938,00:37:17.23,00:37:17.23,It was great.
939,00:37:18.60,00:37:18.60,It was fun.
940,00:37:19.60,00:37:19.60,We're still starving.
941,00:37:21.53,00:37:21.53,We've eatenbut not really.
942,00:37:22.70,00:37:22.70,SONJA:The competitionis stiffer.
943,00:37:24.60,00:37:24.60,The competition
944,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"  we had last night was tough,"
945,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,tougher than I had anticipated.
946,00:37:28.87,00:37:28.87,"How are you holding up,  physically?"
947,00:37:30.37,00:37:30.37,"SONJA:Well, pretty well,you know."
948,00:37:32.27,00:37:32.27,"   I'll fight to the finish,  but, uh, I have my blisters"
949,00:37:35.97,00:37:35.97,"  and whatnot,but I'm-I'm doing okay."
950,00:37:38.40,00:37:38.40, What happened after Quest for Fire?
951,00:37:39.83,00:37:39.83, That was a great competition--
952,00:37:41.27,00:37:41.27,"obviously,a lot at stake."
953,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,"SONJA:Oh, God."
954,00:37:43.63,00:37:43.63, We came close.
955,00:37:44.70,00:37:44.70,   We almost got it.
956,00:37:45.83,00:37:45.83,"SUSAN:Aw, man, we weredragged down two times"
957,00:37:47.70,00:37:47.70,and we were right there.
958,00:37:49.00,00:37:49.00,We almost got it.
959,00:37:50.00,00:37:50.00,SUSAN:There's no way.
960,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,"All right, guys, well..."
961,00:37:52.77,00:37:52.77,  it's obviously a fun group.
962,00:37:54.53,00:37:54.53,  This is not a pleasant process...
963,00:37:56.30,00:37:56.30,"No, not at all."
964,00:37:57.43,00:37:57.43,"JEFF:And I know also,from listening"
965,00:37:59.20,00:37:59.20,"   to you guys talk, that there are"
966,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,a lot of differentreasons why you're here.
967,00:38:02.93,00:38:02.93,"Obviously, $1 million--big motivator for anybody,"
968,00:38:05.27,00:38:05.27,but I'm sensing
969,00:38:06.40,00:38:06.40,"there could bepersonal reasons,"
970,00:38:08.20,00:38:08.20,different journeysyou might be on
971,00:38:09.77,00:38:09.77,that-that thisencompasses.
972,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,"Whatever it is,"
973,00:38:12.83,00:38:12.83,"to fulfillthat agenda,"
974,00:38:14.10,00:38:14.10,you have to survivetonight's Tribal Council.
975,00:38:16.00,00:38:16.00,  That's the way it's set up.
976,00:38:18.27,00:38:18.27,"So, what we'regoing to do is vote"
977,00:38:20.57,00:38:20.57,and how itwill work is
978,00:38:22.10,00:38:22.10,you'll comedown here.
979,00:38:23.10,00:38:23.10,You'll go acrossthis bridge
980,00:38:24.53,00:38:24.53,into our votingconfessional.
981,00:38:26.17,00:38:26.17,  Write the name of the person you want to vote off--
982,00:38:28.57,00:38:28.57," large, clear letters."
983,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,"  Hold it up, and speak your piece."
984,00:38:31.30,00:38:31.30,   We can't hear you.
985,00:38:32.37,00:38:32.37,"Fold it up, put itin the container,"
986,00:38:34.53,00:38:34.53,"come back, andtake a seat."
987,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,"Now, once the votes are tallied, the decision is final"
988,00:38:40.17,00:38:40.17, and you have to leave
989,00:38:41.70,00:38:41.70,the Tribal Councilarea immediately.
990,00:38:44.40,00:38:44.40,   It's time to vote.
991,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23, You're first.
992,00:39:10.03,00:39:10.03, Got to remove the weakest linkin the... crew.
993,00:39:28.70,00:39:28.70,Stacey.
994,00:39:30.90,00:39:30.90," Um, tough call."
995,00:39:34.83,00:39:34.83,   ( sighs )
996,00:39:35.83,00:39:35.83,   Subtle reasons...
997,00:39:37.43,00:39:37.43,  I'm not sure exactly what they are.
998,00:39:45.97,00:39:45.97,  He's just...
999,00:39:46.97,00:39:46.97, He's an ornery guy...
1000,00:39:48.57,00:39:48.57, doesn't really help that much.
1001,00:39:51.03,00:39:51.03,"For a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know  how to start fire..."
1002,00:39:54.63,00:39:54.63, and he  just criticizes everything.
1003,00:40:01.47,00:40:01.47,I'm picking her
1004,00:40:02.97,00:40:02.97,because I think she's the reason   we lost yesterday.
1005,00:40:30.53,00:40:30.53,"   I'll miss his, uh, skills"
1006,00:40:33.30,00:40:33.30,"and, um, his speaking his mind openly."
1007,00:40:49.50,00:40:49.50,"   Before I read these votes,   I just want to commend you"
1008,00:40:51.90,00:40:51.90,on the courage it'staken to get this far.
1009,00:40:54.33,00:40:54.33,There were a lot ofsteps along the way.
1010,00:40:56.70,00:40:56.70,Any of you could'veturned around.
1011,00:40:58.53,00:40:58.53,"Nobody did,and in my book"
1012,00:41:00.17,00:41:00.17,that gives you braggingrights for life.
1013,00:41:02.50,00:41:02.50,"So, with that,I'll read the votes."
1014,00:41:07.20,00:41:07.20,  First vote-- Sonja.
1015,00:41:18.13,00:41:18.13, Sonja.
1016,00:41:25.23,00:41:25.23,Stacey.
1017,00:41:34.93,00:41:34.93, Sonja.
1018,00:41:41.10,00:41:41.10, Rudy.
1019,00:41:48.97,00:41:48.97, Rudy.
1020,00:41:56.77,00:41:56.77, Rudy.
1021,00:41:58.20,00:41:58.20,That's threefor Sonja
1022,00:41:59.73,00:41:59.73,and three for Rudy.
1023,00:42:03.70,00:42:03.70,The first person
1024,00:42:06.03,00:42:06.03,voted off the island...
1025,00:42:08.77,00:42:08.77,Sonja.
1026,00:42:12.33,00:42:12.33,"Sonja, I need youto grab your torch"
1027,00:42:14.70,00:42:14.70,and bringit to me.
