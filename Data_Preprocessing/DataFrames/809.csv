5,00:00:16.33,00:00:16.33,It was the least amount of supplies ever given to a group
6,00:00:18.53,00:00:18.53,of survivors. Their experience and their

29,00:01:24.17,00:01:24.17,of chafing going on. >> And now he's walking
30,00:01:29.27,00:01:29.27,more and more hobbled as the days go by.

40,00:03:10.87,00:03:10.87,know how long this road is. >> This ain't a little
41,00:03:13.50,00:03:13.50,boy's game. This is for the big boys.

71,00:04:45.60,00:04:45.60,>> You and I are going to be strong to the end.

74,00:04:53.60,00:04:53.60,">> So, what do you think?"
75,00:04:55.23,00:04:55.23,You want to make an alliance? Cover our own asses?
76,00:04:57.77,00:04:57.77,>> I don't know if I can take you seriously or not.
77,00:05:00.77,00:05:00.77,>> I'm being 100% serious.
78,00:05:02.47,00:05:02.47,"Amber and I have an alliance, for obvious reasons."
79,00:05:05.00,00:05:05.00,She's beautiful. Any idiot can see that.
80,00:05:07.30,00:05:07.30,>> PROBST: While Rob and Amber's alliance seemed to be made from
81,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,"the heart, Rob's alliance with Big Tom was all business."
82,00:05:14.50,00:05:14.50,">> You watch my back, Tom, I'll watch yours, all"
83,00:05:16.67,00:05:16.67,right? >> Me and Rob's got a
84,00:05:30.40,00:05:30.40,"little alliance. No, I don't trust him."
85,00:05:33.70,00:05:33.70,"Hell, no. But I don't trust none of 'em,"
86,00:05:37.47,00:05:37.47,"and, uh, if Rob will hang in there with me, we can pull this"
87,00:05:41.47,00:05:41.47,"thing through. >> It's humid, huh?"
88,00:05:46.63,00:05:46.63,Big Tom wants to make an alliance with me.
89,00:05:49.60,00:05:49.60,"He wants to stay tight with me, you know?"
90,00:05:52.50,00:05:52.50,I got my thing going with Amber. I got Big Tom on the side.
91,00:05:57.80,00:05:57.80,I think in his eyes it's a primary alliance.
92,00:06:00.30,00:06:00.30,"In mine, it's secondary. But he doesn't need to know"
93,00:06:02.77,00:06:02.77,that. Not until the time comes.
94,00:06:08.70,00:06:08.70,>> PROBST: At the first three-way immunity challenge...

99,00:06:21.00,00:06:21.00,>> PROBST: And Chapera and Mogo Mogo shared immunity.

101,00:06:26.80,00:06:26.80,Safe from Tribal Council and out here at least three more days.

109,00:06:56.43,00:06:56.43,>> I just want to pour some hot chocolate over some hot
110,00:06:59.27,00:06:59.27,guy's bod. >> The winner from
111,00:07:02.80,00:07:02.80,"Survivor Australia, Tina Wesson."
112,00:07:04.77,00:07:04.77,"And from Survivor Borneo, Jenna Lewis."
113,00:07:07.90,00:07:07.90,">> Oh, I'm so glad to be here, everybody!"
114,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,"Oh! Jeff, Jeff! Oh, Jeff, oh."
115,00:07:13.00,00:07:13.00,>> Let's settle down. >> We all decided to be
116,00:07:16.10,00:07:16.10,"Saboga, who was going to Tribal Council that night."
117,00:07:18.33,00:07:18.33,"And we had a blast doing it. >> Here we are, day three."
118,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,"All of you ""Survivor All-Stars."" What's going on? Jerri?"
119,00:07:31.53,00:07:31.53,>> What... what is happening here?
120,00:07:35.47,00:07:35.47,I don't deserve this. The last time I played
121,00:07:37.97,00:07:37.97,"Survivor, we were pretty serious, but everybody here is a"
122,00:07:42.23,00:07:42.23,comedian. There is not one person who's
123,00:07:45.03,00:07:45.03,"not. >> Rupert, you've been"
124,00:07:47.23,00:07:47.23,here for Survivor: Pearl Islands.

126,00:07:52.73,00:07:52.73,Islands. >> The only reason I
127,00:07:55.47,00:07:55.47,"come back, someone messed with the handlebar of my...."
128,00:07:58.63,00:07:58.63,">> I didn't touch your spear, Rupert."
129,00:08:01.40,00:08:01.40,I never touched your spear. >> ( growling ): Rudy!

131,00:08:07.43,00:08:07.43,I played Ethan because I just wanted to give him a hard time
132,00:08:10.73,00:08:10.73,and let everybody realize how ridiculous he looks with his
133,00:08:13.40,00:08:13.40,little jheri curls. >> I think it is time to
134,00:08:16.07,00:08:16.07,vote. >> My vote is for holy
135,00:08:19.13,00:08:19.13,roller Tina. She stabbed me in the back once.
136,00:08:22.00,00:08:22.00,She's not going to do it again. Tina.
137,00:08:24.80,00:08:24.80,">> Jenna, I'm sorry to have to vote for you."
138,00:08:28.40,00:08:28.40,"It's just a game. Sorry, babe."
139,00:08:32.20,00:08:32.20,">> ( In Southern accent ): Lord, please forgive"
140,00:08:34.10,00:08:34.10,"me for my language that I am about to use right now, but Miss"
141,00:08:35.90,00:08:35.90,"Jerri Manthey, I am voting for you."
142,00:08:41.27,00:08:41.27,You were a bitch the first time on Survivor Australia and
143,00:08:44.87,00:08:44.87,three years hasn't done you any good.
144,00:08:46.77,00:08:46.77,You're still a bitch. My vote is for Jerri!
145,00:08:50.83,00:08:50.83,>> I thought everybody was funny at Tribal Council from
146,00:08:54.50,00:08:54.50,Amber playing Tina to Rob playing Jeff Probst.
147,00:08:56.43,00:08:56.43,"I mean, the kid's obviously watched a couple Survivors."
148,00:08:59.77,00:08:59.77,"He's got him down pat. >> Jenna, the tribe has"
149,00:09:03.13,00:09:03.13,"spoken. >> Thanks, Jeff."
150,00:09:05.07,00:09:05.07,>> See y'all. ( all imitating theme song )
151,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,( imitates soundtrack chanting ) ( thunder crashing )
152,00:09:17.17,00:09:17.17,>> PROBST: But the real Tribal Council was no joke for the
153,00:09:19.73,00:09:19.73,"losing Saboga tribe. During a downpour, the stigma of"
154,00:09:22.93,00:09:22.93,being a former winner was too much for Tina to overcome and
155,00:09:26.90,00:09:26.90,she was the first person voted out of Survivor All-Stars.
156,00:09:30.57,00:09:30.57,"Tina, the tribe has spoken. >> TINA: I knew early on that I"
157,00:09:37.60,00:09:37.60,"was in trouble. You know, there was only one"
158,00:09:40.30,00:09:40.30,"other winner, and I knew that they would keep Ethan as the"
159,00:09:42.90,00:09:42.90,stronger one. But what a mistake it would be
160,00:09:45.20,00:09:45.20,"to not even play the game. So that's why I came back, and"
161,00:09:48.13,00:09:48.13,"it's been a blast. >> PROBST: On day four, Colby"
162,00:09:52.67,00:09:52.67,was dealing with a delicate situation.
163,00:09:55.10,00:09:55.10,>> Colby's walking funny because he has a small problem
164,00:09:58.77,00:09:58.77,of chafing going on. I think he has chafed the inner
165,00:10:03.57,00:10:03.57,side of his inner thigh. >> And now he's walking
166,00:10:07.20,00:10:07.20,more and more hobbled as the days go by.
167,00:10:09.63,00:10:09.63,( laughing ) >> A true Texan at heart
168,00:10:12.53,00:10:12.53,"never complains. >> Yeah, things down in"
169,00:10:15.73,00:10:15.73,the nether regions have become a bit chapped.
170,00:10:20.60,00:10:20.60,"My gait, if you will, is my attempt to get a little air flow"
171,00:10:26.80,00:10:26.80,"going in there and hopefully with a little time, everything"
172,00:10:28.80,00:10:28.80,is going to heal. But that's the only way I can
173,00:10:30.97,00:10:30.97,"get relief, is just being as bowlegged as a bull rider who"
174,00:10:35.73,00:10:35.73,"just stepped off a 3,000-pound nightmare."
175,00:10:38.30,00:10:38.30,"It hurts something fierce. >> PROBST: Later on day four, a"
176,00:10:43.00,00:10:43.00,mysterious box with three locks arrived at tree mail.
177,00:10:46.20,00:10:46.20,>> Anything at this point that you get to open is fun
178,00:10:49.63,00:10:49.63,because it's like a gift. >> PROBST: In a grueling reward
179,00:10:52.67,00:10:52.67,"challenge, Ethan carried Saboga to their first victory."
180,00:10:56.67,00:10:56.67,">> PROBST: Saboga wins reward! But with the reward,"
181,00:11:00.33,00:11:00.33,Saboga faced a tough decision. Each tribe today received a
182,00:11:04.40,00:11:04.40,lockbox. I'll tell you what is in the
183,00:11:07.20,00:11:07.20,lockbox. Rice.
184,00:11:09.27,00:11:09.27,The only problem is that lockbox and the rice in it does you
185,00:11:12.40,00:11:12.40,no good because you need three keys to get it open.
186,00:11:15.20,00:11:15.20,"And even if you had it open, without fire, you can't cook the"
187,00:11:17.53,00:11:17.53,rice. So here's the offer.
188,00:11:20.17,00:11:20.17,If you take the pot with the clue and the map and the flint
189,00:11:27.80,00:11:27.80,"instead of the blankets, Mogo Mogo gets it as well as Chapera."
190,00:11:34.37,00:11:34.37,>> Give everybody a chance.
191,00:11:37.07,00:11:37.07,"( cheers ) >> PROBST: With flint, the"

378,00:22:10.37,00:22:10.37,that's what's gonna happen. >> I was very fond of

380,00:22:15.13,00:22:15.13,great until we got the challenge of building a new shelter.
381,00:22:18.70,00:22:18.70,A little bit of conflict and now I'm the devil.
382,00:22:22.07,00:22:22.07,It makes me feel inadequate when the girl won't even look at me.
383,00:22:26.07,00:22:26.07,She will have nothing to do with me right now.

388,00:22:54.20,00:22:54.20,"You guys can head back to camp. Chapera, this is yours to take"
389,00:22:56.50,00:22:56.50,back with you. Chapera enjoyed getting clean...

393,00:23:12.83,00:23:12.83,>> For to us have rice in our system is just like gas in

395,00:23:20.17,00:23:20.17,little more... hoochy. >> PROBST: The rice helped fuel
396,00:23:23.03,00:23:23.03,Chapera to a large lead in a jolting immunity challenge.

415,00:24:31.27,00:24:31.27,around. Being as big of a fan
416,00:24:33.40,00:24:33.40,of Survivor as I am and then having the opportunity not only
417,00:24:36.63,00:24:36.63,"to play the game, but to come back and play an all-star"
418,00:24:39.40,00:24:39.40,version of the game was really the ultimate thrill.

441,00:25:54.77,00:25:54.77,myself made necklaces. We found all the shells and we
442,00:25:58.47,00:25:58.47,"bonded them together, and they quickly became symbolic of the"
443,00:26:02.23,00:26:02.23,"unity that Chapera has, even though we have two new members."

454,00:26:30.83,00:26:30.83,"weren't the biggest, they weren't the strongest, but they"

460,00:26:45.40,00:26:45.40,sticking together. We're gonna take them down one
461,00:26:47.83,00:26:47.83,by one. >> PROBST: The competition
462,00:26:50.33,00:26:50.33,heated up on Day 15 when the two newly formed tribes went-head

464,00:26:57.77,00:26:57.77,First one to hit the water is out.

473,00:27:36.40,00:27:36.40,gotta get rid of. He's the snake in the grass
474,00:27:38.10,00:27:38.10,that's going to cause us the most trouble.
475,00:27:40.13,00:27:40.13,>> PROBST: But Richard got wind of the plot when Jerri tipped
476,00:27:43.17,00:27:43.17,"him off, putting Colby on thin ice."

480,00:27:54.67,00:27:54.67,"Okay. That's it, then, 'cause if you're not for anything else,"
481,00:27:56.67,00:27:56.67,"then we'll just do that. All right, Colby goes."
482,00:27:59.27,00:27:59.27,So they blew it. How dare you approach somebody
483,00:28:01.83,00:28:01.83,to get rid of me? You must go bye-bye now.

489,00:28:30.43,00:28:30.43,"I hope there's some real underlying, intelligent,"
490,00:28:34.80,00:28:34.80,sophisticated game-playing going on that undermined me and that
491,00:28:38.30,00:28:38.30,I'm not aware of. I'd love it more than anything.
492,00:28:41.20,00:28:41.20,"I'd be shocked as hell, but it would be fun to see."

545,00:31:45.20,00:31:45.20,We all sat down and drank probably about four cups of the
546,00:31:48.83,00:31:48.83,strongest coffee you can imagine.
547,00:31:51.27,00:31:51.27,And none of us have had coffee in about a month.

554,00:32:11.07,00:32:11.07,>> Suddenly we're a much more exciting group.
555,00:32:13.40,00:32:13.40,">> Oh, my God, he's going to do a cartwheel!"

559,00:32:23.70,00:32:23.70,coffee. We had the best coffee of our
560,00:32:26.13,00:32:26.13,entire life. Who would have thought just
561,00:32:29.23,00:32:29.23,bringing and introducing a little coffee into the tribe
562,00:32:31.73,00:32:31.73,would have made the biggest difference in the world?

564,00:32:39.53,00:32:39.53,This is nuts. The caffeine is just like
565,00:32:41.80,00:32:41.80,rifling through our bodies. My eyes are opened.
566,00:32:44.60,00:32:44.60,"I mean, I thought I was having vision problems."
567,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,I was also getting my glasses. I just need caffeine.
568,00:32:51.17,00:32:51.17,Ready. >> It's a very happy
569,00:32:55.13,00:32:55.13,beach right now. Don't know how long it will last
570,00:32:57.60,00:32:57.60,"but as long as we've got coffee, we're going to be up and"
571,00:32:59.93,00:32:59.93,smiling. >> Whoo!
572,00:33:08.53,00:33:08.53,">> PROBST: on day 19, Boston Rob had his hands full."
573,00:33:13.43,00:33:13.43,">> I'm out here on a deserted island in Panama, and I"
574,00:33:17.07,00:33:17.07,"got two beautiful women, and they want to make a sandwich out"
575,00:33:19.73,00:33:19.73,of me. What am I going to do?
576,00:33:22.20,00:33:22.20,"Would you say no? Seriously, smarten up."
577,00:33:27.60,00:33:27.60,">> Boston Rob and Amber are very close, and I'm"
578,00:33:30.53,00:33:30.53,"friends with both of them, so all three of us sleep connected."
579,00:33:34.47,00:33:34.47,"I mean, we're rolling around hugging each other."
580,00:33:37.53,00:33:37.53,"I mean, it's friends. >> I'm definitely"
581,00:33:41.27,00:33:41.27,conscious of Jenna hanging out with Rob a lot.
582,00:33:44.60,00:33:44.60,And I think it's definitely a good thing.
583,00:33:46.20,00:33:46.20,It takes some of the tension off of me and Rob hanging out
584,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,together. I'm not going to get jealous of
585,00:33:52.07,00:33:52.07,any of her hanging on him or doing anything like that.
586,00:33:55.37,00:33:55.37,I have Boston Rob wrapped around my little finger.
587,00:33:58.70,00:33:58.70,">> Awesome. A strategy to everything, you"
588,00:34:01.13,00:34:01.13,know? Like there's strategy to putting
589,00:34:04.93,00:34:04.93,my arm around Jenna while I have it around Amber at the same
590,00:34:07.83,00:34:07.83,time. You've got to keep your friends
591,00:34:10.00,00:34:10.00,"close, but you got to keep your enemies closer."
592,00:34:12.50,00:34:12.50,Make no mistake. I'm here to play Survivor.
593,00:34:16.07,00:34:16.07,"At the end of this, hopefully Amber and I can be having some"
594,00:34:19.27,00:34:19.27,"fun together, and we'll be spending my million."
595,00:34:24.20,00:34:24.20,"Worst case scenario, we'll be spending hers."
596,00:34:28.77,00:34:28.77,">> PROBST: At the challenge on day 19, the tribes learned just"
597,00:34:32.63,00:34:32.63,how much was at stake. In addition to being a reward
598,00:34:35.83,00:34:35.83,"challenge, it is also an immunity challenge."
599,00:34:40.20,00:34:40.20,>> Wow. >> PROBST: One more twist: the
600,00:34:42.50,00:34:42.50,winning tribe will select one member from the losing tribe to
601,00:34:45.73,00:34:45.73,"join them on the reward, which means they partake in the"
602,00:34:49.13,00:34:49.13,barbecue and they avoid Tribal Council.
603,00:34:52.20,00:34:52.20,"Survivors, ready? Go!"
604,00:34:54.87,00:34:54.87,Once the challenge got under way...
605,00:34:56.93,00:34:56.93,Mogo Mogo with a bit of a lead. Ethan is off heading into the
606,00:34:59.83,00:34:59.83,jungle. Boston Rob close behind!
607,00:35:02.80,00:35:02.80,">> Come on, Rob! >> PROBST: ...the race to the"
608,00:35:05.70,00:35:05.70,finish line was tight. We're neck and neck!
609,00:35:07.90,00:35:07.90,"In a hard-fought duel, Chapera pulled out a last-moment"
610,00:35:11.10,00:35:11.10,victory. Mogo Mogo off course now.
611,00:35:14.13,00:35:14.13,Chapera heading straight for their dock!
612,00:35:17.63,00:35:17.63,Chapera wins reward and immunity!
613,00:35:23.30,00:35:23.30,( cheers ) Chapera chose to kidnap Kathy.
614,00:35:28.53,00:35:28.53,"Kathy. At first, Kathy wasn't"
615,00:35:30.97,00:35:30.97,comfortable leaving her tribe behind for a day of luxury.
616,00:35:34.83,00:35:34.83,"Chapera, by the way, that's your ride, a 94-foot luxury yacht."
617,00:35:38.83,00:35:38.83,( screams ) But after a barbecue...
618,00:35:41.00,00:35:41.00,>> Some people grabbed plates.
619,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,I didn't even grab a plate. >> PROBST: ...some dessert...
620,00:35:44.83,00:35:44.83,">> Oh, look at this, custard."
621,00:35:46.63,00:35:46.63,>> PROBST: ...and a dip under a tropical waterfall...
622,00:35:48.87,00:35:48.87,( screaming ) Kathy warmed up to her new
623,00:35:51.07,00:35:51.07,friends. >> I feel totally
624,00:35:54.43,00:35:54.43,"welcomed by Chapera. I mean, they brought me in like"
625,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50,I was one of their tribe members.
626,00:35:59.47,00:35:59.47,">> \xe2\x99\xaa We got a new girl, her name is Kat \xe2\x99\xaa"
627,00:36:02.87,00:36:02.87,">> We got a new girl, her name is Kat"
628,00:36:05.50,00:36:05.50,>> \xe2\x99\xaa She fits in just like that >> She fits in just like that. \xe2\x99\xaa
629,00:36:10.60,00:36:10.60,">> PROBST: While Chapera was cruising, Mogo Mogo was getting"
630,00:36:13.87,00:36:13.87,down and dirty. >> PROBST: but Lex had a
631,00:36:30.53,00:36:30.53,different plan in mind. >> You don't get far in
632,00:36:33.20,00:36:33.20,this game by playing safe. I find myself now at the doorway
633,00:36:36.30,00:36:36.30,of an opportunity to do just that for the first time in
634,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"the game, to really do something that probably no one is going"
635,00:36:41.37,00:36:41.37,to expect me to do. Their plan is to get rid of you
636,00:36:43.83,00:36:43.83,tonight. >> I knew that was
637,00:36:45.83,00:36:45.83,coming. >> They think I'm in with
638,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,them and that Shii Ann is as well.
639,00:36:51.07,00:36:51.07,We're going to do Colby tonight. >> I'm very content with
640,00:36:55.57,00:36:55.57,that decision. Colby doesn't see this coming at
641,00:36:57.77,00:36:57.77,all. He doesn't see a single vote
642,00:36:59.83,00:36:59.83,coming in his direction. And if it took losing today to
643,00:37:03.77,00:37:03.77,"get him out of here, I'm totally fine with it."
644,00:37:06.70,00:37:06.70,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, Jerri won the game of cat and"
645,00:37:12.43,00:37:12.43,mouse and her revenge was complete.
646,00:37:15.37,00:37:15.37,Colby was the next person voted out of Survivor All-Stars.
647,00:37:19.73,00:37:19.73,"Colby, the tribe has spoken. >> I had to make"
648,00:37:24.30,00:37:24.30,decisions and getting rid of Richard was a move that my
649,00:37:26.80,00:37:26.80,"entire tribe had to make, but I was left to orchestrate it and"
650,00:37:29.90,00:37:29.90,that really just threw me out in the open.
651,00:37:33.23,00:37:33.23,"In the other tribe members eyes, it seemed as though I was trying"
652,00:37:36.97,00:37:36.97,"to become the power player, the shape-shifter."
653,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,"It wasn't that at all, but unfortunately that's the way the"
654,00:37:40.77,00:37:40.77,game goes. >> PROBST: on day 20 with Colby
655,00:37:47.43,00:37:47.43,"gone, Ethan realized he was still treading water."
656,00:37:50.93,00:37:50.93,">> I thought everything was going smoothly and, boom, I"
657,00:37:54.70,00:37:54.70,thought I was pretty close to Lex.
658,00:37:56.77,00:37:56.77,Not anymore. I don't know what I'm going to
659,00:37:58.97,00:37:58.97,"do here. >> PROBST: Later that day, the"
660,00:38:01.87,00:38:01.87,tribes played for a chance to loot items from the other camp.
661,00:38:05.17,00:38:05.17,"Here we go. First match-up, start spinning."
662,00:38:08.83,00:38:08.83,Chapera's balancing act led them to a win.
663,00:38:12.83,00:38:12.83,">> Run, run, run! Run, run, run!"
664,00:38:15.53,00:38:15.53,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: And Jenna was sent to
665,00:38:18.23,00:38:18.23,"Mogo Mogo to retrieve a grill, a bag of rice, and a Hawaiian"
666,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,sling. >> I've been waiting 20
667,00:38:24.73,00:38:24.73,days to not have to poke fish with a stick.
668,00:38:27.83,00:38:27.83,I'm going to be the hunter tomorrow.
669,00:38:29.93,00:38:29.93,">> PROBST: while Rupert salivaged over the sling, Boston"
670,00:38:33.60,00:38:33.60,Rob and Amber's relationship reached new heights.
671,00:38:38.27,00:38:38.27,>> You're not ever supposed to feel secure in this
672,00:38:42.77,00:38:42.77,"game, but with Rob and I having an alliance, I feel 99.9%"
673,00:38:46.27,00:38:46.27,secure. >> PROBST: The following morning
674,00:38:50.03,00:38:50.03,a fishing competition began to brew between Boston Rob and
675,00:38:53.27,00:38:53.27,Rupert. >> Rupert is all excited
676,00:38:56.00,00:38:56.00,"about having the Hawaiian sling. You know, it's his baby."
677,00:38:59.07,00:38:59.07,Now he can catch a fish and show how much he's worth to the
678,00:39:01.90,00:39:01.90,"tribe. First of all, the guy looks like"
679,00:39:04.60,00:39:04.60,Grizzly Adams but he thinks he Aquaman in the ocean.
680,00:39:07.23,00:39:07.23,And he comes back with a bag of fish feeling all good about
681,00:39:09.80,00:39:09.80,"himself. >> My God, it took all I"
682,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37,had to stop. >> I proceeded to go
683,00:39:14.83,00:39:14.83,into the water and catch 11 fish myself.
684,00:39:17.83,00:39:17.83,Boston-style. >> Sometimes I really
685,00:39:21.60,00:39:21.60,like Boston Rob. >> I got two at one time
686,00:39:24.57,00:39:24.57,on one of them. >> Other times I see
687,00:39:28.27,00:39:28.27,kind of an arrogant pain in the ass.
688,00:39:32.43,00:39:32.43,">> PROBST: At the immunity challenge, it was a dismal show"
689,00:39:37.47,00:39:37.47,of marksmanship. Before Chapera narrowly escaped
690,00:39:46.10,00:39:46.10,with victory. Chapera wins immunity!
691,00:39:50.10,00:39:50.10,Mogo Mogo heading to Tribal Council.
692,00:39:53.37,00:39:53.37,"Back at Mogo Mogo, Lex took his old friend Ethan aside and gave"
693,00:39:57.37,00:39:57.37,him some bad news. >> I think it's just better
694,00:40:02.37,00:40:02.37,for my game if we vote you out tonight.
695,00:40:04.93,00:40:04.93,It has nothing to do with friendship.
696,00:40:06.33,00:40:06.33,This is business. I've got my own agenda this
697,00:40:08.90,00:40:08.90,time. I've got my own plan.
698,00:40:10.20,00:40:10.20,It doesn't include him. This isn't Africa.
699,00:40:13.20,00:40:13.20,This is All-Star. >> PROBST: But Ethan wasn't
700,00:40:15.73,00:40:15.73,about to go down without a fight.
701,00:40:17.17,00:40:17.17,He approached Kathy with a plan. >> There's no rhyme or
702,00:40:21.03,00:40:21.03,reason of how Lex is playing this game.
703,00:40:23.50,00:40:23.50,There will be no sense of security with Lex at any time.
704,00:40:27.10,00:40:27.10,>> But I don't want to take Lex out before Jerri.
705,00:40:29.53,00:40:29.53,>> No. >> It will be Jerri
706,00:40:31.77,00:40:31.77,"tonight, all right. >> So I'll vote for Jerri"
707,00:40:34.00,00:40:34.00,and then you and Shii Ann can talk about it.
708,00:40:35.87,00:40:35.87,"And I'm a gambler. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
709,00:40:43.63,00:40:43.63,Ethan's gamble didn't pay off. He was the next person voted out
710,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,"of Survivor All-Stars. Ethan, the tribe has spoken."
711,00:40:55.47,00:40:55.47,>> I've been just struggling since day one trying
712,00:40:59.23,00:40:59.23,to fight and bite and scramble my way through this game.
713,00:41:03.10,00:41:03.10,And I lasted 21 days. And I'm proud.
714,00:41:05.50,00:41:05.50,I made it further than any other winner.
715,00:41:08.20,00:41:08.20,"I have the title of Survivor: Africa champion, and no one can"
716,00:41:11.60,00:41:11.60,take that away from me. No matter what I do from this
717,00:41:13.87,00:41:13.87,"point on for the rest of my life, I have that, and that's a"
718,00:41:16.90,00:41:16.90,good feeling. >> PROBST: Where once 18
719,00:41:23.23,00:41:23.23,"all-stars stood, now only ten remain."
720,00:41:26.30,00:41:26.30,"What experiences and twists await Big Tom, Amber, Boston"

724,00:41:47.20,00:41:47.20,adventure continues. >> Just another
