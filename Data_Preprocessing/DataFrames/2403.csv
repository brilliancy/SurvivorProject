1086,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,AND THAT'S HOW I SAW IT FROM DAY
1087,00:32:46.83,00:32:46.83,"ONE AND, FRANKLY, I SAW YOU AS"
1088,00:32:47.67,00:32:47.67,PART OF THE ROOSTERS.
1089,00:32:48.50,00:32:48.50,I WOULD LOVE TO CREATE A NEW

1091,00:32:51.50,00:32:51.50,SCRAMBLE AND GET RID OF COLTON.
1092,00:32:52.77,00:32:52.77,THE GUYS IN POWER ARE GOING
1093,00:32:54.50,00:32:54.50,TO VOTE FOR COLTON AND WHEN WE
1094,00:32:56.33,00:32:56.33,GET BACK TO CAMP THEY'RE GOING

1098,00:33:01.80,00:33:01.80,STILL IN THE FRONT OF IT.
1099,00:33:03.73,00:33:03.73,WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE AND WE'LL
1100,00:33:05.07,00:33:05.07,BE SAFE AND HIT THE MERGE AND
1101,00:33:06.47,00:33:06.47,HOPEFULLY TAKE OUT THE CHICKS.
1102,00:33:08.67,00:33:08.67,MATT BASICALLY SAY JERK.
1103,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,HE CALLS THE STRONGEST GUYS THE
1104,00:33:12.50,00:33:12.50,ROOSTERS AND THE WHOLE TIME I'M
1105,00:33:14.00,00:33:14.00,AGREEING WITH HIM BUT IN MY MIND
1106,00:33:15.90,00:33:15.90,I'M LIKE I AM NEVER GOING TO BE
1107,00:33:18.33,00:33:18.33,WITH YOU.

1123,00:33:41.77,00:33:41.77,I THINK MATT IS SO POWER
1124,00:33:43.00,00:33:43.00,HUNGRY--
1125,00:33:43.43,00:33:43.43,YOU THINK WE SHOULD GET RID
1126,00:33:44.63,00:33:44.63,OF MATT BEFORE WE GET RID OF
1127,00:33:46.10,00:33:46.10,BILL?
1128,00:33:46.50,00:33:46.50,"WELL, EVERYBODY WANTS TO VOTE"
1129,00:33:47.50,00:33:47.50,FOR BILL.

1131,00:33:50.30,00:33:50.30,BETWEEN BILL AND MATT.
1132,00:33:51.00,00:33:51.00,IF I HAD MY WAY BILL WOULD GO
1133,00:33:53.00,00:33:53.00,BECAUSE HE'S ANNOYING AND I HATE
1134,00:33:53.93,00:33:53.93,HIM AND I HATE HIS VOICE AND I
1135,00:33:55.63,00:33:55.63,CAN'T STAND TO LISTEN TO HIM

1169,00:35:11.63,00:35:11.63,BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
1170,00:35:13.90,00:35:13.90,ALLIANCES GOING ON IN THISTRIBE.
1171,00:35:15.23,00:35:15.23,IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF.
1172,00:35:16.83,00:35:16.83,"Jeff: TARZAN, SO ONLY EIGHT"
1173,00:35:18.43,00:35:18.43,GAMES WITHIN THIS GAME THERE ARE
1174,00:35:19.70,00:35:19.70,FRACTIONS WITHIN THIS GROUP OF
1175,00:35:21.23,00:35:21.23,NINE.

1179,00:35:25.40,00:35:25.40,AND I THINK WE'LL STICK
1180,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,TOGETHER.
1181,00:35:27.27,00:35:27.27,THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

1187,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING HOME
1188,00:35:37.87,00:35:37.87,TONIGHT.
1189,00:35:38.37,00:35:38.37,Jeff: AND WHY IS THAT?
1190,00:35:39.33,00:35:39.33,BECAUSE I HAVE AN IDOL.
1191,00:35:41.53,00:35:41.53,THE GIRLS GAVE IT TO ME.
1192,00:35:43.00,00:35:43.00,Jeff: SO YOU'RE SAYING
1193,00:35:44.00,00:35:44.00,YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME BECAUSE

1198,00:35:50.40,00:35:50.40,AND GO HOME.
1199,00:35:50.83,00:35:50.83,THAT'S STUPID.
1200,00:35:52.13,00:35:52.13,"Jeff: MICHAEL, IS THERE A"
1201,00:35:54.00,00:35:54.00,THOUGHT THAT AN IDOL AT CAMP IS
1202,00:35:56.80,00:35:56.80,TOO DISRUPTIVE SO LET'S THROW
1203,00:35:58.23,00:35:58.23,SOME VOTES JUST TO MAKE SURE WE
1204,00:35:59.50,00:35:59.50,GET IT OUT.
1205,00:35:59.93,00:35:59.93,THAT'S ON A LOT OF OUR MINDS.
1206,00:36:02.50,00:36:02.50,"COLTON, HE'S COLTON."
1207,00:36:03.53,00:36:03.53,THIS WHOLE TIME HE'S WORKED WITH
1208,00:36:05.30,00:36:05.30,TWO TRIBES.
1209,00:36:06.87,00:36:06.87,"HE WAS SLEEPING OVER THERE,"
1210,00:36:07.90,00:36:07.90,EATING OVER THERE AND WE DIDN'T
1211,00:36:09.13,00:36:09.13,KNOW WHICH WAY IT WAS GOING AND
1212,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,THEN HE HAS AN IDOL ON OUR SIDE
1213,00:36:11.97,00:36:11.97,SO IT'S DISRUPTING THE WHOLE
1214,00:36:13.40,00:36:13.40,GAME.
1215,00:36:13.73,00:36:13.73,"Jeff: COLTON, YOU'VE BEEN"
1216,00:36:14.63,00:36:14.63,SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH THE
1217,00:36:15.90,00:36:15.90,WOMEN.
1218,00:36:16.33,00:36:16.33,"WELL, YEAH, THAT SHOULDN'T BE"
1219,00:36:17.53,00:36:17.53,A SHOCK.

1221,00:36:19.80,00:36:19.80,SHOULDN'T THAT BE A SHOCK?
1222,00:36:21.03,00:36:21.03,ARE YOU ON THE MEN'S TRIBE.
1223,00:36:22.73,00:36:22.73,ALL OF MY FRIENDS AT HOME ARE

1229,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,"AND SO YOU LOOK AT ME AND SAY,"
1230,00:36:30.50,00:36:30.50,"""DUUH."""
1231,00:36:30.93,00:36:30.93,"IT ACTUALLY IS A REVERSE DUUH,DOUBLE DARE"
1232,00:36:34.07,00:36:34.07,ON YOU.
1233,00:36:36.67,00:36:36.67,"HERE'S THE THING, WOMEN ARE"
1234,00:36:38.27,00:36:38.27,"MORE, LIKE, NURTURING AND THEY"

1237,00:36:44.03,00:36:44.03,Jeff: DO YOU REALIZE WHAT
1238,00:36:44.87,00:36:44.87,KIND OF A TARGET YOU PUT ON YOUR
1239,00:36:46.57,00:36:46.57,BACK WHEN YOU SAY THAT?
1240,00:36:47.27,00:36:47.27,"WELL, YEAH, BUT THAT"
1241,00:36:49.00,00:36:49.00,DISTRIBUTE MEAN I'M GOING TO
1242,00:36:49.87,00:36:49.87,VOTE WITH THOSE WOMEN.
1243,00:36:50.87,00:36:50.87,"Jeff: BILL, EXPLAIN TO ME"
1244,00:36:52.87,00:36:52.87,HOW THIS MAKES SENSE.
1245,00:36:53.53,00:36:53.53,"I MEAN, HONESTLY, AS MUCH AS"
1246,00:36:56.00,00:36:56.00,HE ASSUMED THAT WE SPOT ON
1247,00:36:57.67,00:36:57.67,JUDGED HIM.
1248,00:36:58.33,00:36:58.33,HE SPOT ON JUDGED US AND ASSUMED
1249,00:37:00.43,00:37:00.43,WE WOULDN'T TAKE HIM IN --
1250,00:37:01.63,00:37:01.63,"YOU MEAN, BECAUSE HE'S GAY?"
1251,00:37:03.77,00:37:03.77,YEAH.
1252,00:37:07.23,00:37:07.23,Jeff: TARZAN.
1253,00:37:08.43,00:37:08.43,HERE'S WHAT WE DISCOVERED.
1254,00:37:11.23,00:37:11.23,COLTON'S HIGHLY INTELLIGENT.
1255,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,HE'S INVALUABLE WITH REGARD TO
1256,00:37:14.33,00:37:14.33,UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS GAME
1257,00:37:15.50,00:37:15.50,PLAYS.
1258,00:37:16.00,00:37:16.00,HE ALREADY HAS ALLEGIANCES WITH
1259,00:37:17.50,00:37:17.50,"FEMALES OVER THERE, AND WHEN WE"
1260,00:37:19.83,00:37:19.83,"COMBINE, HE'S ALREADY SAID."
1261,00:37:21.87,00:37:21.87,HE'S REAL SMART.
1262,00:37:23.50,00:37:23.50,IF WE VALUE OUR SURVIVAL WE NEED
1263,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,HIM IN THE FIRST FEW PLAYS HERE.
1264,00:37:26.87,00:37:26.87,"WHO IS ""WE,"" TARZAN."
1265,00:37:29.67,00:37:29.67,I'M TALK AGO I USED THE WORD
1266,00:37:32.03,00:37:32.03,"""WE"" IN A GENERAL SENSE."
1267,00:37:33.33,00:37:33.33,I'M TRYING TO HELP COLTON DEFEND
1268,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,HIS STATUS BECAUSE I BELIEVE
1269,00:37:37.87,00:37:37.87,HE'S VERY VALUABLE AND I THINK
1270,00:37:38.90,00:37:38.90,OUR TEAM WILL PROSPER IF HE
1271,00:37:40.57,00:37:40.57,STAYS HERE A BIT LONGER.
1272,00:37:42.03,00:37:42.03,"Jeff: AND, MATT, YOU'RE NOT"
1273,00:37:43.27,00:37:43.27,BUYING IT.
1274,00:37:43.70,00:37:43.70,"WELL, I THINK TARZAN HAS, YOU"
1275,00:37:45.93,00:37:45.93,"KNOW, PUT OUT A CRY FOR HELP TO"
1276,00:37:48.03,00:37:48.03,WHOEVER IT IS THE FIVE GUYS WHO
1277,00:37:49.37,00:37:49.37,ARE WITH HIM.
1278,00:37:50.17,00:37:50.17,AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE TARZAN IS
1279,00:37:52.00,00:37:52.00,SHIVERING IN HIS BOOTS OVER
1280,00:37:52.93,00:37:52.93,"HERE, AND I'M JUST GETTING SICK"
1281,00:37:54.67,00:37:54.67,OF HIM USING VAGUE TERMS AND
1282,00:37:56.60,00:37:56.60,WANT HIM TO TALK TURKEY.
1283,00:37:57.87,00:37:57.87,YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY WRONG.
1284,00:37:59.17,00:37:59.17,THAT'S NOT THE MOTIVE BEHIND
1285,00:38:00.63,00:38:00.63,WHAT I'M SAYING.
1286,00:38:01.07,00:38:01.07,I'M NOT BUYING IT.
1287,00:38:02.10,00:38:02.10,MY HEART IS BROKEN THAT HE
1288,00:38:04.40,00:38:04.40,MISINTERPRETS ME.
