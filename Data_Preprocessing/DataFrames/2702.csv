188,00:12:05.23,00:12:05.23,HERE WE GO. SURVIVORS READY?
189,00:12:10.70,00:12:10.70,GO. IT REQUIRES A DELICATE
190,00:12:18.57,00:12:18.57,"COMBINATION OF SPEED, DEXTERITY, TO WHICH RUPERT IS THROWING"
191,00:12:23.87,00:12:23.87,CAUTION TO THE WIND AND BLOWING THROUGH THIS.
192,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,AND HE'S TALL ENOUGH HE DOESN'T EVEN NEED THE STEPS BUT IT FALLS
193,00:12:30.53,00:12:30.53,OFF. PICK THEM UP AND GO BACK TO THE
194,00:12:32.03,00:12:32.03,START. IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO RUSH
195,00:12:34.97,00:12:34.97,IF IT'S GOING TO FALL. CANDICE HAS HER FIRST ONE.
196,00:12:40.70,00:12:40.70,MARISSA HAS HER FIRST. THERE ARE 10 TOTAL.
197,00:12:43.27,00:12:43.27,YOU HAVE TO STACK ALL OF THEM. RUPERT HAS HIS FIRST.
198,00:12:48.60,00:12:48.60,CANDICE IS ON HER SECOND. OUT TO AN EARLY LEAD.

200,00:12:54.40,00:12:54.40,IT'S ONE THING TO GET THERE. THEN YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR STACK
201,00:12:57.97,00:12:57.97,NICE AND STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE TALLER IT GETS THE MORE LIKELY
202,00:13:00.73,00:13:00.73,IT IS TO FALL. CANDICE PLACES HER SEVENTH.
203,00:13:16.53,00:13:16.53,RUPERT PLACES HIS SEVENTH. IT IS NOW CAPPEDIS AND RUPERT.
204,00:13:19.83,00:13:19.83,MARISSA IS TRYING TO PLACE THAT SIXTH ONE.
205,00:13:22.77,00:13:22.77,CANDICE WORKING ON HER EIGHTH. RUPERT NOW WORKING ON HIS
206,00:13:26.03,00:13:26.03,EIGHTH. THE WIND IS STARTING TO PICK UP.
207,00:13:28.17,00:13:28.17,CANDICE HAS HER EIGHTH. RUPERT TRYING TO PLACE HIS
208,00:13:32.37,00:13:32.37,"EIGHTH. RUPERT PLACES HIS EIGHTH, BUT"
209,00:13:40.73,00:13:40.73,THAT STACK IS LEANING. CANDICE PLACING HER NINTH.

213,00:14:02.50,00:14:02.50,FIRST SPOOL. CANDICE VERY CLOSE TO WINNING
214,00:14:05.13,00:14:05.13,THIS AND STAYING ALIVE. SHE'LL NUMBER CHARGE OF WHO GETS
215,00:14:09.60,00:14:09.60,THAT CLUE IF SHE CAN JUST PLACE THIS.
216,00:14:13.27,00:14:13.27,VERY TOUGH WHEN YOU'RE AT THE TOP.
217,00:14:15.87,00:14:15.87,IT'S EASY TO KNOCK THE ENTIRE STACK OVER.
218,00:14:25.00,00:14:25.00,">> JEFF. >> Jeff: ONE, TWO, THREE, CAND"

226,00:14:50.13,00:14:50.13,TO STAY ALIVE ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS GET IT ON TOP OF THAT STACK
227,00:14:53.67,00:14:53.67,AND HOLD IT FOR THREE SECONDS. >> GET YOUR ELBOWS UP!
228,00:14:57.77,00:14:57.77,MAKE IT LEVEL. GET YOUR ELBOWS UP IN THE BACK.
