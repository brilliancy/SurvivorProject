192,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,just started talking to himabout what we could possibly do.
193,00:12:43.25,00:12:43.25,>> Yeah.>> And then we're straight.
194,00:12:50.46,00:12:50.46,>> I'm so happy about how todayturned out for Raro.
195,00:12:53.46,00:12:53.46,"It's a really, really good day.Adam, don't you dare start with"
196,00:12:59.12,00:12:59.12,me.>> Why?
197,00:13:03.25,00:13:03.25,>> I can tell what's on yourmind.
198,00:13:06.67,00:13:06.67,">> You can read me like a book,huh?"
199,00:13:09.29,00:13:09.29,I've been boozing it up a bittoday.
200,00:13:11.46,00:13:11.46,"They had some beer and somewine, and I... you know, I"
201,00:13:15.21,00:13:15.21,partaked a little bit.>> What happened to Candice?
202,00:13:24.75,00:13:24.75,">> You know, it's good to sitback and relax, not to have to"
203,00:13:27.29,00:13:27.29,"worry about challenges, not haveto worry about tribal council."
204,00:13:30.08,00:13:30.08,>> Dirty bird.>> It's been a great day.
205,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,It's been the best day sinceI've been here.
206,00:13:39.83,00:13:39.83,">> I'm not sure there is a wholelot of danger, to be honest."
207,00:13:42.12,00:13:42.12,They don't have the numbersto arrange a split vote.
208,00:13:45.04,00:13:45.04,Our backs are against the wall.We need someone to flip.
209,00:13:47.17,00:13:47.17,We've kind of come up with adesperate plan based on the fact
210,00:13:50.21,00:13:50.21,"that I have the hidden immunityidol, and it could change,"
211,00:13:52.92,00:13:52.92,"hopefully, the whole flow of thegame."

216,00:14:04.25,00:14:04.25,here will do that.>> I agree.
217,00:14:06.29,00:14:06.29,">> Jonathan, if I can convincehim..."
218,00:14:08.04,00:14:08.04,>> He's the one person havingthe best...

221,00:14:13.46,00:14:13.46,"can't beat us."">> It sounds like it might be"

223,00:14:27.38,00:14:27.38,"man, going forward.>> Okay."
224,00:14:30.04,00:14:30.04,"Like, does it make sense underany scenario for us to work"
225,00:14:32.08,00:14:32.08,"together again?>> At this point, I could not"
226,00:14:36.17,00:14:36.17,entertain what you're talkingabout at all.
227,00:14:39.96,00:14:39.96,I do not believe that Ozzy wouldtrust me.
228,00:14:42.50,00:14:42.50,I'm not sure why you would trustme.
229,00:14:44.71,00:14:44.71,>> Jonathan deserted us.We had an alliance going.
230,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,"And he turned his back on thealliance and, you know,"
231,00:14:49.75,00:14:49.75,"basically left us for dead.But at the same time, like, you"
232,00:14:52.29,00:14:52.29,"know, I don't really have anoption here."
233,00:14:54.17,00:14:54.17,"I've got to figure out somethingthat's going to work, and this"
234,00:14:56.25,00:14:56.25,might work.>> Let's say I did what you're
235,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,"proposing, okay, which I'mactually not entertaining, but"
236,00:15:00.54,00:15:00.54,I'll play the scenario.I don't believe you can get to
237,00:15:03.67,00:15:03.67,the final four unless you'realigned with the person with the
238,00:15:06.12,00:15:06.12,idol.Because let's say you have the
239,00:15:09.88,00:15:09.88,"idol, okay, and we vote for you,three of you vote for me, okay."
240,00:15:14.21,00:15:14.21,"Boom, I'm out.Right?"
241,00:15:16.25,00:15:16.25,>> Right.>> So I would have to align with
242,00:15:19.00,00:15:19.00,"you, because otherwise I'm goingto get my ass booted out before"
243,00:15:21.04,00:15:21.04,"the final four.If I flip again, the Raro people"
244,00:15:24.83,00:15:24.83,are going to go mental.Mental.
245,00:15:28.58,00:15:28.58,"Right now, they trust thatthere's no way that the Aitu"
246,00:15:33.04,00:15:33.04,people would trust me or that Iwould ever go back to them.
247,00:15:36.17,00:15:36.17,">> Hypothetically, say I havethe idol, how would I know that"
248,00:15:39.00,00:15:39.00,if I were to tell you that I hadthe idol you wouldn't just turn
249,00:15:41.42,00:15:41.42,around and tell the rest of yourtribe?
250,00:15:43.96,00:15:43.96,">> Hypothetically, you... wewould have to learn to trust"
251,00:15:47.54,00:15:47.54,"each other again.What am I going to say, ""I"
252,00:15:50.38,00:15:50.38,"promise?""Okay, I promise."
253,00:15:53.29,00:15:53.29,And what's that... what's thatworth to you?
254,00:15:55.38,00:15:55.38,You know what I mean?I'd have to think long and hard
255,00:15:57.38,00:15:57.38,about my reaction if you evenimplied you could show me the
256,00:15:59.33,00:15:59.33,"idol.If you don't have it,"
257,00:16:01.46,00:16:01.46,"unfortunately, right now, I havethe position where I can say"
258,00:16:04.71,00:16:04.71,you're just going to have to sitand let me figure out what I
259,00:16:06.88,00:16:06.88,want to do.>> Okay.
260,00:16:08.62,00:16:08.62,All right.>> All right?
261,00:16:10.46,00:16:10.46,>> To be continued.>> All right.
262,00:16:12.38,00:16:12.38,">> Always a good thing.If Yul has the idol, I have to"
263,00:16:17.67,00:16:17.67,consider flipping.I made a very impetuous move
264,00:16:20.62,00:16:20.62,once.It worked out in my favor.
265,00:16:24.21,00:16:24.21,I have the numbers.But if I was with the guy who
266,00:16:26.58,00:16:26.58,"had the idol all along and Ihave to flip back, that's a"
267,00:16:28.67,00:16:28.67,fantastic twist.>> So I think I know a way to
268,00:17:01.33,00:17:01.33,change the game.>> How?
269,00:17:03.21,00:17:03.21,>> I have the idol.I found it.
270,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,And I think I can use it to getJonathan.
271,00:17:10.50,00:17:10.50,>> Yul pulled me aside thismorning and he said that he in
272,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,"fact has the idol.He has the hidden immunity idol,"
273,00:17:19.08,00:17:19.08,"and he's been talking toJonathan, trying to convince him"
274,00:17:21.96,00:17:21.96,"to come to our side.>> If this works out, all four"
275,00:17:25.17,00:17:25.17,"of us are in the final four.>> I mean, how awesome."
276,00:17:27.62,00:17:27.62,"We deserve it, right?Come on!"
277,00:17:29.33,00:17:29.33,">> So that was pretty excitingto hear, because definitely the"
278,00:17:31.54,00:17:31.54,"nice little wild card, you know?>> You found it?"
279,00:17:35.62,00:17:35.62,That's crazy.>> I found it.
280,00:17:37.33,00:17:37.33,"Like, I wanted to tell you guys,but then I wanted to wait for a"
281,00:17:39.12,00:17:39.12,moment where we could change thegame.
282,00:17:41.21,00:17:41.21,"And I feel like this is it.>> Yul has the idol, and as long"
283,00:17:43.79,00:17:43.79,"as Yul can convince Jonathan toflip sides, we're going to be"
284,00:17:46.83,00:17:46.83,okay.The only thing I'm worried about
285,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,"is what to do with Nate, becausehe's a really cool guy, you"
286,00:17:51.42,00:17:51.42,know?I enjoy hanging out with him.
287,00:17:53.79,00:17:53.79,But I still feel like I've gotto be true to Yul and my tribe.
288,00:17:57.21,00:17:57.21,>> This could take all four ofus all the way.
289,00:17:59.38,00:17:59.38,"And I'm like, that's how itshould be played."
290,00:18:01.17,00:18:01.17,"All right, buddy?We can do it."
291,00:18:12.08,00:18:12.08,>> What if Ozzy wins immunity?Yul has to go before Becky and
292,00:18:15.12,00:18:15.12,"Sundra.>> He's really intelligent, and"
293,00:18:18.46,00:18:18.46,he's a good competitor.>> Yeah.
294,00:18:21.46,00:18:21.46,What do you think Nate thinksabout it?
295,00:18:23.25,00:18:23.25,>> I know Nate will do whateverwe wanted.
296,00:18:25.75,00:18:25.75,>> I want Yul gone simplybecause I don't like the way he
297,00:18:30.12,00:18:30.12,"and Jonathan talk.>> He's, like, stirring up"
298,00:18:32.17,00:18:32.17,trouble.>> Yeah.
299,00:18:46.00,00:18:46.00,">> He's feeling around, youknow?"
300,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,">> What is he saying?>> He's saying ""Come over, deal"
301,00:18:53.50,00:18:53.50,"with us.""And I'm like, ""Are you crazy?"
302,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,"Ozzy's going to vote me out inone second."""
303,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,">> Who do you think goes first?>> I mean, that's just stupid."
304,00:19:12.04,00:19:12.04,">> Raro, they want to vote forYul right now."
305,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,"They think he's the mastermind.But if Yul has the idol, it's"
306,00:19:19.12,00:19:19.12,"going to be me that goes home,because they're all going to"
307,00:19:22.00,00:19:22.00,"vote for me.Yul will play the idol, I'll"
308,00:19:24.33,00:19:24.33,"have the second highest numberof votes, and I'm going to get"
309,00:19:27.08,00:19:27.08,"sent home.Somebody has the idol, okay?"
310,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,"If it's on our side, then we'regolden."
311,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,It doesn't matter.But I don't have it.
312,00:19:35.88,00:19:35.88,>> Yeah.>> You don't have it.

315,00:19:44.21,00:19:44.21,"All this is very hypothetical,because I told Yul, I said,"

412,00:27:53.58,00:27:53.58,"Grab your stuff, head on back tocamp."
413,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,See you at tribal.>> Yeah.
414,00:28:15.25,00:28:15.25,>> You did amazing.I can't believe that you stayed
415,00:28:17.04,00:28:17.04,"up so long.>> I was like, ""This is my only"

420,00:28:30.33,00:28:30.33,another couple of days because Ilike the captain.
421,00:28:33.08,00:28:33.08,"If there's a way I can work withhim, I'm definitely down."
422,00:28:37.25,00:28:37.25,>> How much longer would youhave stayed up there?
423,00:28:39.21,00:28:39.21,>> I think I could have keptgoing.
424,00:28:41.67,00:28:41.67,">> Yeah.>> Ozzy, him winning the"
425,00:28:43.71,00:28:43.71,"challenge today, is a perfectexample of why we should get rid"
426,00:28:45.88,00:28:45.88,of him as soon as possible.He's the biggest threat.
427,00:28:48.96,00:28:48.96,But right now he's got immunity.So tonight our tribe is sticking
428,00:28:52.38,00:28:52.38,"together, and we're going to allvote out Yul."
429,00:28:56.25,00:28:56.25,">> Yul, you were on there for awhile."
430,00:29:02.96,00:29:02.96,>> Yul is the choice becausehe's brilliant.
431,00:29:06.21,00:29:06.21,"He's, like, Mr. Harvard-Yale-Stanford guy."
432,00:29:09.96,00:29:09.96,"And he's also really, reallystrong."
433,00:29:12.58,00:29:12.58,So we just want to get him outas quickly as possible.
434,00:29:23.08,00:29:23.08,>> I got eight.>> So the hypothetical is a
435,00:29:28.92,00:29:28.92,reality.And I'm asking you for both of
436,00:29:36.29,00:29:36.29,our sakes to become my allyagain.
437,00:29:39.79,00:29:39.79,>> I was not that surprised whenYul showed me the idol.
438,00:29:43.88,00:29:43.88,After our conversation yesterdayit made perfect sense.
439,00:29:47.12,00:29:47.12,So now I have a lot to thinkabout and a huge decision to
440,00:29:49.96,00:29:49.96,"make, because basically, Yulsaid, ""Vote with us or you're"
441,00:29:53.46,00:29:53.46,"going home tonight."">> This is only chance we've"
442,00:29:56.88,00:29:56.88,got.Everyone recognizes that.
443,00:29:58.92,00:29:58.92,This is the only way this isgoing to work.
444,00:30:01.00,00:30:01.00,"I thought about it, though.I would want to go to the final"
445,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,"two with you, because, honestly,I think my chances against you"
446,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,are better than either Becky orSundra.
447,00:30:10.12,00:30:10.12,>> I appreciate you showing thatto me.
448,00:30:13.04,00:30:13.04,I have to think about it.I really do.
449,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,>> All right.>> Okay?
450,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,>> To be continued.>> My only concern about Yul is
451,00:30:26.21,00:30:26.21,he's the only other guy who hasbeen to exile.
452,00:30:33.38,00:30:33.38,"Do you have the idol?>> Yul was there for, like, a"
453,00:30:36.71,00:30:36.71,day.There's no way he has it.
454,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,">> I floated this idea to them.I said, ""What if Yul has the"
455,00:30:42.46,00:30:42.46,"idol?""Well, they were like, ""He"
456,00:30:44.62,00:30:44.62,"doesn't have it.He's got to go."""
457,00:30:47.25,00:30:47.25,These people aren't thinking.I don't believe they're smart
458,00:30:49.50,00:30:49.50,enough.They don't want to put the
459,00:30:51.88,00:30:51.88,mental energy into even runningthe scenario of what if Yul
460,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,"actually has it?And if I can't convince them,"
461,00:30:56.12,00:30:56.12,"Yul will play the idol, it willbounce back, and I'll be going"
462,00:30:59.38,00:30:59.38,home very early.>> Yeah!
463,00:31:08.50,00:31:08.50,>> Jonathan refuses to vote Yuloff.
464,00:31:14.96,00:31:14.96,">> No, he can't come into ourgame and tell us what to do, you"
465,00:31:17.04,00:31:17.04,"know what I'm saying, dog?You and I are calling the shots,"
466,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,"dog.>> I know, but we need five"
467,00:31:21.67,00:31:21.67,votes.>> Okay.
468,00:31:26.25,00:31:26.25,"I mean, I agree, I just...You know what I'm saying?"
469,00:31:33.17,00:31:33.17,">> Nate's convinced we shouldget rid of Yul, and I'm fine"
470,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,"with that, but I'm concernedabout Nate, just because he's"
471,00:31:39.79,00:31:39.79,"acting different recently.He's not his usual self, and"
472,00:31:44.08,00:31:44.08,"he's been hanging around Ozzy alot, and that concerns me."
473,00:31:50.29,00:31:50.29,>> Nate just needs to chill out.>> He's just thinking too much.
474,00:31:53.58,00:31:53.58,>> We're good.And Jonathan's good.
475,00:32:21.62,00:32:21.62,">> Please understand, I have tothink about this."
476,00:32:23.75,00:32:23.75,It's an extraordinarily bigthing to do.
477,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,It's very appealing to jump overto them.
478,00:32:35.04,00:32:35.04,"On the other hand, Adam andCandice welcomed me to this"
479,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,"tribe, really helped me out,kept me alive here."
480,00:32:40.71,00:32:40.71,"I would hate to betray them,because if I do that, it makes"
481,00:32:45.08,00:32:45.08,me the guy who betrayed everysingle person in the game at one
482,00:32:48.50,00:32:48.50,"time or another.Basically, Yul said, ""We'll pick"
483,00:32:59.08,00:32:59.08,"whoever you want to go.""And since I feel some loyalty to"
484,00:33:01.96,00:33:01.96,"Adam, I said Nate, who I trustthe least, because I know him"
485,00:33:05.88,00:33:05.88,the least.>> You guys have to think about
486,00:33:09.12,00:33:09.12,that.>> It's entirely possible that
487,00:33:23.04,00:33:23.04,Jonathan's pretending to goalong with the plan in order to
488,00:33:25.50,00:33:25.50,direct the vote away from himonto Nate.
489,00:33:29.08,00:33:29.08,"And if he doesn't vote with ustonight, I'm going to play the"
490,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"idol, and once it's played, thenI'm vulnerable."
491,00:33:35.12,00:33:35.12,I don't want to do that.So I don't know.
492,00:33:37.25,00:33:37.25,I'm hoping somehow all thisclicks together.
493,00:33:53.96,00:33:53.96,">> Either way, people are goingto be pissed."
494,00:33:56.08,00:33:56.08,Either I'll have betrayed theRaro people and I'm a complete
495,00:33:58.12,00:33:58.12,"bastard, or I didn't jump overto the Aitu people, and I'm a"
496,00:34:01.79,00:34:01.79,complete bastard who screwedthem twice.
497,00:34:06.12,00:34:06.12,I don't know what I'm going todo.
498,00:34:08.25,00:34:08.25,I wish I knew.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
499,00:34:32.04,00:34:32.04,"the members of the jury.Brad, Rebecca, and Jenny, both"
500,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,voted out at the last tribalcouncil.
501,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,"Jonathan, how did the mergechange this game?"
502,00:34:50.38,00:34:50.38,">> Well, the very least of it isthe sleeping accommodations have"
503,00:34:53.50,00:34:53.50,"been hard.There's nine in a tent, and"
504,00:34:56.08,00:34:56.08,we've all had to get used toliving together after so many
505,00:34:58.50,00:34:58.50,weeks of vying with each otherlike this.
506,00:35:01.92,00:35:01.92,">> PROBST: Sundra, how did thegame change from your"
507,00:35:04.29,00:35:04.29,"perspective?>> Well, the game changed in"
508,00:35:06.58,00:35:06.58,that we have to start thinkingindividually as well as still
509,00:35:10.25,00:35:10.25,"thinking within your alliances,your former tribemates."
510,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,"There's a lot of time with...with these people, so you can't"
511,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33,"help but be bonded.>> PROBST: Nate, tribal lines"
512,00:35:21.00,00:35:21.00,still in play?>> Yeah.
513,00:35:23.58,00:35:23.58,"Oh, definitely.It's like we've all made it to a"
514,00:35:25.58,00:35:25.58,"certain point.But, kind of, we're kind of"
515,00:35:27.33,00:35:27.33,"starting all over, so you'regoing to definitely stick to"
516,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,"what you're comfortable with,and those who know you, and"
517,00:35:31.42,00:35:31.42,"those who you know.>> PROBST: Yul, so if that's the"
518,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,"case, then Aitu is down innumbers."
519,00:35:36.79,00:35:36.79,>> The likelihood that all fourof us are here at all is very
520,00:35:40.25,00:35:40.25,"low, but we stuck together, andprevailed against the odds."
521,00:35:43.88,00:35:43.88,"But the fact remains, you know,both tribes are tight, and so we"
522,00:35:47.42,00:35:47.42,"came in at a huge disadvantage,and the odds are still stacked"
523,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,against us.So I don't know what our fate is
524,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,going to be.I feel like tonight is going to
525,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,"be pivotal.>> PROBST: Becky, do you see any"

528,00:36:03.42,00:36:03.42,"between those two.And they're very close, just"
529,00:36:05.83,00:36:05.83,"body language.So when he came over here, we"
530,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,sort of saw that.>> The closest bond out here is
531,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,"those two right now.>> Becky, you and Yul, y'all"
532,00:36:14.21,00:36:14.21,come on!You trippin'.
533,00:36:16.71,00:36:16.71,>> But it was different.I don't want lie on his lap.
534,00:36:19.00,00:36:19.00,"It's just a different bond,different body language."

536,00:36:23.62,00:36:23.62,>> They love each other.They want to make babies.
537,00:36:26.50,00:36:26.50,They snuggle next to each otherin the shelter.
538,00:36:30.08,00:36:30.08,I got booted out of my spot.>> You told me you left because
539,00:36:33.04,00:36:33.04,"he wasn't snugly, he wasn'tpaying enough attention to you."

542,00:36:41.71,00:36:41.71,concern you a little bit to seetwo people pairing up in a way
543,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,that's different than you andOzzy might become friends?
544,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,>> Ah!>> Certainly different than me
545,00:36:52.62,00:36:52.62,and Ozzy.I think they really are enjoying
546,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,"each other's company, but,honestly, I do not see that it"
547,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,has moved into some kind ofromantic situation.
548,00:37:02.04,00:37:02.04,"And to answer, no, it doesn'tconcern me."

551,00:37:10.04,00:37:10.04,"set something in motion.You know, either it's going to"
552,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,"just go downhill for Aitu, or,you know, something crazy could"
553,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"happen.At this point, I think we're"
554,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"definitely at a pivotal moment.>> PROBST: Nate, do you think"
555,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,the dynamic will be differentwhen you guys go back to camp
556,00:37:24.54,00:37:24.54,"tonight?>> Yeah, it's definitely going"
557,00:37:27.12,00:37:27.12,to stir up the waters.If someone from Raro decided to
558,00:37:31.21,00:37:31.21,"jump over, the cat's going to beout of the bag."
559,00:37:35.12,00:37:35.12,Or if someone from Aitu...because pretty much both tribes
