4,00:00:08.54,00:00:08.54,">> Candice and Adam had a little attraction, so I'm a little"
5,00:00:11.67,00:00:11.67,worried because we don't want Adam to falter.
6,00:00:14.25,00:00:14.25,>> PROBST: At the reward challenge...
7,00:00:16.58,00:00:16.58,">> North by northeast. >> Wait, it's north-northwest."

11,00:00:28.04,00:00:28.04,>> Hopefully this is a character-building experience.
12,00:00:38.75,00:00:38.75,">> PROBST: At the reward, Aitu felt like champions."
13,00:00:42.42,00:00:42.42,>> It was a warrior's welcome. That's part of their culture.
14,00:00:45.46,00:00:45.46,And we were warriors that just came out of a fierce battle.
15,00:00:47.46,00:00:47.46,>> PROBST: At the immunity challenge...
16,00:00:50.04,00:00:50.04,The losing tribe will take back to camp with them this bottle.
17,00:00:52.67,00:00:52.67,...a message in a bottle promised a mysterious twist to
18,00:00:55.33,00:00:55.33,"the game. >> Go, Rebecca!"
19,00:00:58.21,00:00:58.21,>> PROBST: The two tribes battled it out...
20,00:01:00.38,00:01:00.38,Sundra has fourth bundle for Aitu.
21,00:01:02.42,00:01:02.42,...and Aitu was victorious once again.
22,00:01:05.04,00:01:05.04,"Aitu wins immunity! Raro, we have a date at tribal"
23,00:01:08.75,00:01:08.75,council. You will open this bottle after
24,00:01:11.21,00:01:11.21,"the vote. Back at Raro, Rebecca was blamed"
25,00:01:15.96,00:01:15.96,for their loss... >> There hasn't been one
26,00:01:19.00,00:01:19.00,challenge where Rebecca has been a strong force to help our tribe
27,00:01:22.50,00:01:22.50,win. >> PROBST: ...while Jonathan
28,00:01:25.12,00:01:25.12,hoped his hard work earned him a spot within the tribe.
29,00:01:28.38,00:01:28.38,>> I think I have earned at least the right of one more

32,00:01:37.21,00:01:37.21,"...Jonathan was spared. Rebecca, the tribe has spoken."
33,00:01:40.21,00:01:40.21,Then the mystery of the bottle was revealed.
34,00:01:44.04,00:01:44.04,">> ""You've just voted out one member of your tribe."
35,00:01:48.42,00:01:48.42,"You will now vote out another."" >> PROBST: So Jonathan was back"
36,00:01:52.12,00:01:52.12,in the hot seat. But at the end of the second
37,00:01:55.29,00:01:55.29,vote... The 11th person voted out of
38,00:01:57.21,00:01:57.21,Cook Islands and the third member of our jury.
39,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,...it was Jenny who took the fall.
40,00:02:01.29,00:02:01.29,"Jenny, the tribe has spoken. Nine are left."
41,00:02:04.75,00:02:04.75,Who will be voted out tonight?  Captioning sponsored by

43,00:02:22.04,00:02:22.04,>> Fish are already up. Yep.
44,00:02:28.33,00:02:28.33,"You know, I realized the first time I was out there it was just"
45,00:02:31.46,00:02:31.46,like hitting them in a barrel. And now they're much more
46,00:02:34.04,00:02:34.04,skittish. Yep.
47,00:02:36.21,00:02:36.21,"Well, anyway, I'll bring back a bunch."
48,00:02:39.33,00:02:39.33,"The way the votes came down last night, they could have gotten"
49,00:02:42.08,00:02:42.08,rid of me at any point. Whether or not that mutiny was a
50,00:02:45.08,00:02:45.08,"good idea or not, I can't even really worry about it."
51,00:02:50.04,00:02:50.04,"It worked out my way. At least at this point, it's"
52,00:02:53.21,00:02:53.21,gone the way that I hoped it would go.
53,00:02:55.71,00:02:55.71,Three people from this tribe have been eliminated before
54,00:02:58.17,00:02:58.17,Candice and I. And now I'm in a powerful
55,00:03:01.08,00:03:01.08,"position in a smaller tribe, and that's a good place to be."
56,00:03:21.04,00:03:21.04,>> How's the fire? >> I'm a little disappointed
57,00:03:25.75,00:03:25.75,this morning. I know these are young people
58,00:03:28.08,00:03:28.08,"who like to sleep in, but they're going to have to listen"
59,00:03:30.25,00:03:30.25,"to me now, and they're going to see my way is a good way."
60,00:03:34.42,00:03:34.42,Let's get this fire going. >> What's wrong with it?
61,00:03:37.75,00:03:37.75,">> We have to get it together today, right?"
62,00:03:40.21,00:03:40.21,We're going to eat. Where's the water?
63,00:03:42.50,00:03:42.50,Have we got water? >> I'll get it right now.
64,00:03:44.54,00:03:44.54,">> Yeah, let's go. >> I got it."
65,00:03:46.29,00:03:46.29,">> Get fire going, get water boiling."
66,00:03:48.54,00:03:48.54,We have to hit it right now. Let's go some firewood going
67,00:03:51.21,00:03:51.21,here. >> Jonathan better slow his
68,00:03:53.75,00:03:53.75,role. Don't be coming around barking
69,00:03:56.25,00:03:56.25,"no orders in the morning, you know?"
70,00:03:58.75,00:03:58.75,"It's like, ""Shut up, fool."" Okay, first we all know what"
71,00:04:00.42,00:04:00.42,we're doing. We're not knuckleheads around
72,00:04:02.17,00:04:02.17,here. >> Damn it.
73,00:04:06.25,00:04:06.25,All that just burned right up. >> We need to win challenges.
74,00:04:11.04,00:04:11.04,We need to work hard around camp.
75,00:04:13.88,00:04:13.88,"We need to turn things around. You know, I really got so close"
76,00:04:24.21,00:04:24.21,"to just bawling them out. And I almost said, ""Either I"
77,00:04:26.12,00:04:26.12,have to be your father or your boss?
78,00:04:28.04,00:04:28.04,Is that how you need to be treated to do anything in an
79,00:04:29.67,00:04:29.67,organization? Because I'm not going to lose
80,00:04:31.38,00:04:31.38,"because you kids can't get your asses out of bed."""
81,00:06:04.62,00:06:04.62,>> What? >> I just don't feel good.
82,00:06:07.58,00:06:07.58,">> What's wrong with you? >> I'm just a little, like,"
83,00:06:10.79,00:06:10.79,tired and achy. >> We've been having challenge
84,00:06:19.00,00:06:19.00,"after challenge after challenge, and not getting a whole lot of"
85,00:06:21.04,00:06:21.04,"down time to recover, and yesterday and today I just feel"
86,00:06:23.21,00:06:23.21,really crappy. I am getting a little bit
87,00:06:25.54,00:06:25.54,"worried, especially going forward, that it's going to be a"
88,00:06:27.62,00:06:27.62,problem. >> We are still the underdogs.
89,00:06:35.88,00:06:35.88,"I mean, they still have the numbers over us."
90,00:06:37.88,00:06:37.88,"It's like we have to prove ourselves every day, every"
91,00:06:40.83,00:06:40.83,challenge. That's all we can do.
92,00:06:43.46,00:06:43.46,"That's all we can do. >> PROBST: Aitu, Raro, come on"
93,00:06:53.75,00:06:53.75,"in. Aitu, getting your first look at"
94,00:07:04.25,00:07:04.25,"the new Raro tribe, Rebecca voted out at the last tribal"
95,00:07:08.50,00:07:08.50,"council, and Jenny voted out at the last tribal council."
96,00:07:11.92,00:07:11.92,>> Two? Whoa.
97,00:07:14.54,00:07:14.54,">> PROBST: Okay, Aitu, this last challenge you won is enormous."
98,00:07:18.62,00:07:18.62,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Had Aitu lost that
99,00:07:21.04,00:07:21.04,"challenge, it would be 7-2. Sundra, what's the feeling now"
100,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,as you watch Raro walk in a tribe of five?
101,00:07:26.50,00:07:26.50,">> Yeah, it's a mixture of things."
102,00:07:28.42,00:07:28.42,"I think we're getting very even, and it makes you think you can't"
103,00:07:30.75,00:07:30.75,get comfortable at any point. >> PROBST: The game is clearly
104,00:07:33.71,00:07:33.71,"up for grabs. Okay, let's get down to"
105,00:07:36.75,00:07:36.75,"business. Paints, brushes, blank tribe"
106,00:07:42.96,00:07:42.96,flag... >> Whoa.
107,00:07:46.17,00:07:46.17,>> ...and new buffs. You are merging into one tribe.
108,00:07:49.92,00:07:49.92,Drop your buffs. >> We always wanted to have the
109,00:07:53.38,00:07:53.38,"merge before we lost our numbers, so we were really"
110,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17,"hoping it was today, and the future's looking bright."
111,00:07:59.33,00:07:59.33,">> PROBST: New buff, Ozzy. Yul, Sundra."
112,00:08:04.00,00:08:04.00,">> ""Wow"" is the correct word. Much different game."
113,00:08:08.71,00:08:08.71,We as the Aitu four have some maneuvering to do.
114,00:08:11.21,00:08:11.21,There are still only four of us. We're still underdogs.
115,00:08:13.38,00:08:13.38,But winners never quit. >> PROBST: Now to the big order
116,00:08:19.25,00:08:19.25,of business-- where you're going to live?
117,00:08:21.00,00:08:21.00,">> We've got more coconuts. Trust us, get over here."
118,00:08:22.67,00:08:22.67,>> No rats. >> We have no rats.
119,00:08:24.29,00:08:24.29,>> Jonathan and Candice have seen both camps.
120,00:08:26.12,00:08:26.12,So what do you guys prefer? You'd rather stay at Raro?
121,00:08:28.12,00:08:28.12,">> Well, there's definitely more coconuts."
122,00:08:29.96,00:08:29.96,There are no rats. >> Leave the ghetto!
123,00:08:33.08,00:08:33.08,">> Come on over, guys. >> I think we're all cool going"
124,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,over to their camp. >> PROBST: So the merge is off
125,00:08:37.29,00:08:37.29,to a good start. You've decided that you will
126,00:08:40.54,00:08:40.54,live on Raro's beach as one. Now you have to get to that
127,00:08:43.25,00:08:43.25,beach. There is a large native
128,00:08:45.92,00:08:45.92,catamaran just off the shore filled with food and
129,00:08:48.50,00:08:48.50,refreshments. Follow the drums and have a good
130,00:08:55.42,00:08:55.42,"time. >> Yeah, let's eat!"
131,00:09:05.25,00:09:05.25,"Yeah, baby! >> All right!"
132,00:09:08.71,00:09:08.71,">> Oh, my god! >> I knew something was up!"
133,00:09:11.46,00:09:11.46,I knew something was up! >> Thank you!
134,00:09:21.50,00:09:21.50,>> Thank you! >> Let's all make a toast.
135,00:09:30.33,00:09:30.33,>> Whoo! >> Let's all have some fun.
136,00:09:34.38,00:09:34.38,">> Oh, my god! >> Okay, who wants coleslaw?"
137,00:09:37.25,00:09:37.25,">> Hey, you guys have any of that mustard or barbecue sauce"
138,00:09:38.83,00:09:38.83,over there? Can a brother get a dip?
139,00:09:40.54,00:09:40.54,">> Guys, I know it's all a game, but I'm really looking forward"
140,00:09:42.25,00:09:42.25,to getting to know the people on the other side I've never gotten
141,00:09:44.25,00:09:44.25,a chance to interact with. >> He does.
142,00:09:51.12,00:09:51.12,>> We have a new identity now. We've merged into one tribe.
143,00:09:53.04,00:09:53.04,But the fact of the matter remains that we're still divided
144,00:09:55.38,00:09:55.38,"into two tribes, and as Aitu came in with lower numbers,"
145,00:09:58.71,00:09:58.71,things looked pretty bleak. We seriously thought it was
146,00:10:01.54,00:10:01.54,"going to be over for us. The fact that we're still here,"
147,00:10:03.71,00:10:03.71,it's great. We're trying to figure out if
148,00:10:06.33,00:10:06.33,there's any chink in the armor in Rarotonga.
149,00:10:09.46,00:10:09.46,We desperately need to convince someone to come over to our
150,00:10:11.71,00:10:11.71,side. >> We're glad to see you.
151,00:10:13.50,00:10:13.50,>> Y'all are some tough competitors.
152,00:10:15.46,00:10:15.46,">> Let the games begin, one on one."
153,00:10:17.17,00:10:17.17,"It's going to be fun. >> The Raro kids, all they"
154,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,"wanted to do was get faded, which is not what we used to"
155,00:10:26.29,00:10:26.29,"call it. >> How you doing, brother?"
156,00:10:28.88,00:10:28.88,>> I'm starting to do really well.
157,00:10:30.75,00:10:30.75,">> Oh, no! There he goes!"
158,00:10:33.62,00:10:33.62,>> I'm watching my girlish figure.
159,00:10:39.42,00:10:39.42,">> These kids are vomiting, they're eating and drinking so"
160,00:10:43.04,00:10:43.04,much. Is that how you compete in a
161,00:10:45.04,00:10:45.04,competition? I'm here to win a million... a
162,00:10:47.29,00:10:47.29,million dollars. That's a one with six zeroes on
163,00:10:52.38,00:10:52.38,"the other end of it, okay? They're psychos."
164,00:10:54.88,00:10:54.88,"I mean, I don't understand it! >> Thank you."
165,00:11:07.17,00:11:07.17,>> Thank you very much! >> Thank you!
166,00:11:09.92,00:11:09.92,">> Beautiful, lovely. >> Thank you very much!"
167,00:11:15.58,00:11:15.58,>> Thank you! >> Our new tribe name is
168,00:11:19.12,00:11:19.12,Aitutonga. We did a little combo with them
169,00:11:21.38,00:11:21.38,both. so Aitutonga's our new little
170,00:11:23.79,00:11:23.79,"snap. Hey, guys, welcome to our home."
171,00:11:26.67,00:11:26.67,"All right, latrines are down to the east side and west side."
172,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,>> We have a coconut grove. >> I feel we have cool numbers
173,00:11:32.21,00:11:32.21,"because we had a 5-4 merge, and everyone on my previous tribe,"
174,00:11:35.79,00:11:35.79,"Rarotonga, we're all sticking together regardless."
175,00:11:38.71,00:11:38.71,"Parvati, Adam, and I are very close."
176,00:11:41.08,00:11:41.08,"Jonathan and Candice can't really sway, because they sold"
177,00:11:45.17,00:11:45.17,them out in the mutiny. So I'm feeling very good.
178,00:11:48.21,00:11:48.21,"But it's also good to read the other tribemates, because"
179,00:11:51.42,00:11:51.42,"you've got to keep your enemies close, you know."
180,00:11:57.38,00:11:57.38,>> Yeah. Tap dance.
181,00:11:59.88,00:11:59.88,">> Yeah, because we're both on both sides, so..."
182,00:12:02.12,00:12:02.12,">> Parvati's gold, got that lock."
183,00:12:05.50,00:12:05.50,">> So is Sundra. >> Ozzy is a good captain, you"
184,00:12:08.17,00:12:08.17,"know? He's real mellow, down to earth,"
185,00:12:10.54,00:12:10.54,homey. I see Ozzy and I clicking nice.
186,00:12:14.54,00:12:14.54,So I'm keeping my eyes on him in case things get kind of ugly.
187,00:12:18.21,00:12:18.21,>> Yul and Becky are... they're solid.
188,00:12:20.62,00:12:20.62,">> Yul is going to get cut off, though, because my five are"
189,00:12:23.04,00:12:23.04,going to want to cut off your strong points.
190,00:12:27.96,00:12:27.96,">> I've always known that I might have an ally with Nate,"
191,00:12:30.96,00:12:30.96,just from the time when we kidnapped him over to our side.
192,00:12:35.12,00:12:35.12,"I took advantage of that right away, and as soon as possible,"
193,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,just started talking to him about what we could possibly do.
194,00:12:43.25,00:12:43.25,>> Yeah. >> And then we're straight.
195,00:12:50.46,00:12:50.46,>> I'm so happy about how today turned out for Raro.
196,00:12:53.46,00:12:53.46,"It's a really, really good day. Adam, don't you dare start with"
197,00:12:59.12,00:12:59.12,me. >> Why?
198,00:13:03.25,00:13:03.25,>> I can tell what's on your mind.
199,00:13:06.67,00:13:06.67,">> You can read me like a book, huh?"
200,00:13:09.29,00:13:09.29,I've been boozing it up a bit today.
201,00:13:11.46,00:13:11.46,"They had some beer and some wine, and I... you know, I"
202,00:13:15.21,00:13:15.21,partaked a little bit. >> What happened to Candice?
203,00:13:24.75,00:13:24.75,">> You know, it's good to sit back and relax, not to have to"
204,00:13:27.29,00:13:27.29,"worry about challenges, not have to worry about tribal council."
205,00:13:30.08,00:13:30.08,>> Dirty bird. >> It's been a great day.
206,00:13:32.21,00:13:32.21,It's been the best day since I've been here.
207,00:13:39.83,00:13:39.83,">> I'm not sure there is a whole lot of danger, to be honest."
208,00:13:42.12,00:13:42.12,They don't have the numbers to arrange a split vote.
209,00:13:45.04,00:13:45.04,Our backs are against the wall. We need someone to flip.
210,00:13:47.17,00:13:47.17,We've kind of come up with a desperate plan based on the fact
211,00:13:50.21,00:13:50.21,"that I have the hidden immunity idol, and it could change,"
212,00:13:52.92,00:13:52.92,"hopefully, the whole flow of the game."
213,00:13:55.17,00:13:55.17,>> Jonathan I know is... more than anything else he's a
214,00:13:57.75,00:13:57.75,"rational player. >> Yeah, and I agree."
215,00:13:59.50,00:13:59.50,">> Like, he's going to put defense above, like, personal"
216,00:14:02.08,00:14:02.08,consideration. I don't know if the other people
217,00:14:04.25,00:14:04.25,here will do that. >> I agree.
218,00:14:06.29,00:14:06.29,">> Jonathan, if I can convince him..."
219,00:14:08.04,00:14:08.04,>> He's the one person having the best...
220,00:14:09.92,00:14:09.92,">> Yeah, in a rational sense. ""You know what?"
221,00:14:11.62,00:14:11.62,"You come over, we have the numbers, I have the idol, you"
222,00:14:13.46,00:14:13.46,"can't beat us."" >> It sounds like it might be"
223,00:14:15.42,00:14:15.42,"the best play to do, then. >> So let's just talk strategy,"
224,00:14:27.38,00:14:27.38,"man, going forward. >> Okay."
225,00:14:30.04,00:14:30.04,"Like, does it make sense under any scenario for us to work"
226,00:14:32.08,00:14:32.08,"together again? >> At this point, I could not"
227,00:14:36.17,00:14:36.17,entertain what you're talking about at all.
228,00:14:39.96,00:14:39.96,I do not believe that Ozzy would trust me.
229,00:14:42.50,00:14:42.50,I'm not sure why you would trust me.
230,00:14:44.71,00:14:44.71,>> Jonathan deserted us. We had an alliance going.
231,00:14:47.17,00:14:47.17,"And he turned his back on the alliance and, you know,"
232,00:14:49.75,00:14:49.75,"basically left us for dead. But at the same time, like, you"
233,00:14:52.29,00:14:52.29,"know, I don't really have an option here."
234,00:14:54.17,00:14:54.17,"I've got to figure out something that's going to work, and this"
235,00:14:56.25,00:14:56.25,might work. >> Let's say I did what you're
236,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,"proposing, okay, which I'm actually not entertaining, but"
237,00:15:00.54,00:15:00.54,I'll play the scenario. I don't believe you can get to
238,00:15:03.67,00:15:03.67,the final four unless you're aligned with the person with the
239,00:15:06.12,00:15:06.12,idol. Because let's say you have the
240,00:15:09.88,00:15:09.88,"idol, okay, and we vote for you, three of you vote for me, okay."
241,00:15:14.21,00:15:14.21,"Boom, I'm out. Right?"
242,00:15:16.25,00:15:16.25,>> Right. >> So I would have to align with
243,00:15:19.00,00:15:19.00,"you, because otherwise I'm going to get my ass booted out before"
244,00:15:21.04,00:15:21.04,"the final four. If I flip again, the Raro people"
245,00:15:24.83,00:15:24.83,are going to go mental. Mental.
246,00:15:28.58,00:15:28.58,"Right now, they trust that there's no way that the Aitu"
247,00:15:33.04,00:15:33.04,people would trust me or that I would ever go back to them.
248,00:15:36.17,00:15:36.17,">> Hypothetically, say I have the idol, how would I know that"
249,00:15:39.00,00:15:39.00,if I were to tell you that I had the idol you wouldn't just turn
250,00:15:41.42,00:15:41.42,around and tell the rest of your tribe?
251,00:15:43.96,00:15:43.96,">> Hypothetically, you... we would have to learn to trust"
252,00:15:47.54,00:15:47.54,"each other again. What am I going to say, ""I"
253,00:15:50.38,00:15:50.38,"promise?"" Okay, I promise."
254,00:15:53.29,00:15:53.29,And what's that... what's that worth to you?
255,00:15:55.38,00:15:55.38,You know what I mean? I'd have to think long and hard
256,00:15:57.38,00:15:57.38,about my reaction if you even implied you could show me the
257,00:15:59.33,00:15:59.33,"idol. If you don't have it,"
258,00:16:01.46,00:16:01.46,"unfortunately, right now, I have the position where I can say"
259,00:16:04.71,00:16:04.71,you're just going to have to sit and let me figure out what I
260,00:16:06.88,00:16:06.88,want to do. >> Okay.
261,00:16:08.62,00:16:08.62,All right. >> All right?
262,00:16:10.46,00:16:10.46,>> To be continued. >> All right.
263,00:16:12.38,00:16:12.38,">> Always a good thing. If Yul has the idol, I have to"
264,00:16:17.67,00:16:17.67,consider flipping. I made a very impetuous move
265,00:16:20.62,00:16:20.62,once. It worked out in my favor.
266,00:16:24.21,00:16:24.21,I have the numbers. But if I was with the guy who
267,00:16:26.58,00:16:26.58,"had the idol all along and I have to flip back, that's a"
268,00:16:28.67,00:16:28.67,fantastic twist. >> So I think I know a way to
269,00:17:01.33,00:17:01.33,change the game. >> How?
270,00:17:03.21,00:17:03.21,>> I have the idol. I found it.
271,00:17:06.21,00:17:06.21,And I think I can use it to get Jonathan.
272,00:17:10.50,00:17:10.50,>> Yul pulled me aside this morning and he said that he in
273,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,"fact has the idol. He has the hidden immunity idol,"
274,00:17:19.08,00:17:19.08,"and he's been talking to Jonathan, trying to convince him"
275,00:17:21.96,00:17:21.96,"to come to our side. >> If this works out, all four"
276,00:17:25.17,00:17:25.17,"of us are in the final four. >> I mean, how awesome."
277,00:17:27.62,00:17:27.62,"We deserve it, right? Come on!"
278,00:17:29.33,00:17:29.33,">> So that was pretty exciting to hear, because definitely the"
279,00:17:31.54,00:17:31.54,"nice little wild card, you know? >> You found it?"
280,00:17:35.62,00:17:35.62,That's crazy. >> I found it.
281,00:17:37.33,00:17:37.33,"Like, I wanted to tell you guys, but then I wanted to wait for a"
282,00:17:39.12,00:17:39.12,moment where we could change the game.
283,00:17:41.21,00:17:41.21,"And I feel like this is it. >> Yul has the idol, and as long"
284,00:17:43.79,00:17:43.79,"as Yul can convince Jonathan to flip sides, we're going to be"
285,00:17:46.83,00:17:46.83,okay. The only thing I'm worried about
286,00:17:49.17,00:17:49.17,"is what to do with Nate, because he's a really cool guy, you"
287,00:17:51.42,00:17:51.42,know? I enjoy hanging out with him.
288,00:17:53.79,00:17:53.79,But I still feel like I've got to be true to Yul and my tribe.
289,00:17:57.21,00:17:57.21,>> This could take all four of us all the way.
290,00:17:59.38,00:17:59.38,"And I'm like, that's how it should be played."
291,00:18:01.17,00:18:01.17,"All right, buddy? We can do it."
292,00:18:12.08,00:18:12.08,>> What if Ozzy wins immunity? Yul has to go before Becky and
293,00:18:15.12,00:18:15.12,"Sundra. >> He's really intelligent, and"
294,00:18:18.46,00:18:18.46,he's a good competitor. >> Yeah.
295,00:18:21.46,00:18:21.46,What do you think Nate thinks about it?
296,00:18:23.25,00:18:23.25,>> I know Nate will do whatever we wanted.
297,00:18:25.75,00:18:25.75,>> I want Yul gone simply because I don't like the way he
298,00:18:30.12,00:18:30.12,"and Jonathan talk. >> He's, like, stirring up"
299,00:18:32.17,00:18:32.17,trouble. >> Yeah.
300,00:18:46.00,00:18:46.00,">> He's feeling around, you know?"
301,00:18:48.67,00:18:48.67,">> What is he saying? >> He's saying ""Come over, deal"
302,00:18:53.50,00:18:53.50,"with us."" And I'm like, ""Are you crazy?"
303,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,"Ozzy's going to vote me out in one second."""
304,00:19:02.17,00:19:02.17,">> Who do you think goes first? >> I mean, that's just stupid."
305,00:19:12.04,00:19:12.04,">> Raro, they want to vote for Yul right now."
306,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,"They think he's the mastermind. But if Yul has the idol, it's"
307,00:19:19.12,00:19:19.12,"going to be me that goes home, because they're all going to"
308,00:19:22.00,00:19:22.00,"vote for me. Yul will play the idol, I'll"
309,00:19:24.33,00:19:24.33,"have the second highest number of votes, and I'm going to get"
310,00:19:27.08,00:19:27.08,"sent home. Somebody has the idol, okay?"
311,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,"If it's on our side, then we're golden."
312,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,It doesn't matter. But I don't have it.
313,00:19:35.88,00:19:35.88,>> Yeah. >> You don't have it.
314,00:19:37.96,00:19:37.96,"If we vote for Yul, and Yul has it, we're going to find"
315,00:19:41.21,00:19:41.21,ourselves going home for no good reason.
316,00:19:44.21,00:19:44.21,"All this is very hypothetical, because I told Yul, I said,"
317,00:19:48.54,00:19:48.54,"""Until you show me the idol, I can't make a decision."""
318,00:19:51.08,00:19:51.08,"If he doesn't show it to me, then he's just blowing smoke"
319,00:19:55.21,00:19:55.21,"( no audio ) ass, and there's no reason for me to flip."
320,00:20:05.38,00:20:05.38,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to your"
321,00:20:14.67,00:20:14.67,first individual immunity challenge?
322,00:20:16.92,00:20:16.92,>> Yes. >> PROBST: First things first.
323,00:20:18.71,00:20:18.71,"Ozzy, I'll take back the immunity idol."
324,00:20:21.62,00:20:21.62,Tribal immunity is no more. Individual immunity is now what
325,00:20:25.75,00:20:25.75,you covet. This is the immunity necklace.
326,00:20:31.67,00:20:31.67,>> Nice. >> PROBST: When you have the
327,00:20:34.17,00:20:34.17,"immunity necklace around your neck, you are safe."
328,00:20:36.58,00:20:36.58,You cannot be voted out. Immunity is the single most
329,00:20:39.83,00:20:39.83,important element in this game. Ready to get to the challenge?
330,00:20:44.04,00:20:44.04,>> Yeah. >> Yep.
331,00:20:46.12,00:20:46.12,>> PROBST: Today's challenge is very simple.
332,00:20:47.71,00:20:47.71,Each of you are going to hang onto a pole for as long as you
333,00:20:50.62,00:20:50.62,"can. When you fall off the pole,"
334,00:20:53.62,00:20:53.62,you're out of the challenge. Last person left hanging on
335,00:20:56.25,00:20:56.25,"their pole wins immunity, is safe at tonight's tribal"
336,00:20:59.46,00:20:59.46,council. Only one rule-- you cannot use
337,00:21:01.58,00:21:01.58,the top of the pole to support yourself.
338,00:21:04.58,00:21:04.58,"We'll draw for spots, and we'll get started."
339,00:21:20.54,00:21:20.54,The challenge is officially underway.
340,00:21:39.54,00:21:39.54,"Nate sliding around the pole, trying to get a foothold."
341,00:21:46.12,00:21:46.12,Adam struggling to hang on. Candice absolutely calm.
342,00:21:56.79,00:21:56.79,"Adam slides down the pole, finds a safe spot."
343,00:22:01.67,00:22:01.67,Nate loses some ground. Adam slips a little further down
344,00:22:11.08,00:22:11.08,the pole. Not much room left.
345,00:22:21.42,00:22:21.42,"Adam, first one out of this challenge."
346,00:22:24.12,00:22:24.12,We are down to eight people vying for immunity.
347,00:22:28.25,00:22:28.25,>> It's only beginning. >> PROBST: Where are you feeling
348,00:22:41.08,00:22:41.08,"it, Jonathan? >> My feet a little bit."
349,00:22:43.46,00:22:43.46,"My feet are a lot bigger, so the little bit of rope is... just"
350,00:22:48.33,00:22:48.33,"hard, I guess. I don't know."
351,00:22:50.96,00:22:50.96,">> I think Jonathan has a point, though"
352,00:22:53.12,00:22:53.12,">> PROBST: What's that? >> Basically, the surface area"
353,00:22:55.12,00:22:55.12,"supporting all of us is about the same, even if your feet are"
354,00:22:57.29,00:22:57.29,"a little bit bigger or not. But, you know, your mass goes up"
355,00:23:00.08,00:23:00.08,at a faster rate than surface area.
356,00:23:02.25,00:23:02.25,It's kind of like why elephants can't run up trees.
357,00:23:05.21,00:23:05.21,>> PROBST: Just what I was thinking.
358,00:23:07.12,00:23:07.12,>> Clearly. >> I'm never going to get a date
359,00:23:09.17,00:23:09.17,again. >> Smart equals sexy.
360,00:23:12.21,00:23:12.21,">> PROBST: Jonathan loses his grip, slides halfway down the"
361,00:23:17.12,00:23:17.12,pole. Jonathan now standing on his
362,00:23:20.83,00:23:20.83,last bit of rope. Nate struggling.
363,00:23:29.92,00:23:29.92,"Jonathan curling those toes. Jonathan, second person out of"
364,00:23:34.96,00:23:34.96,"the challenge. First two people out, guys."
365,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,Nate starts to slide down the pole a bit.
366,00:23:48.42,00:23:48.42,Sundra starting to slip. First woman to lose her
367,00:23:54.08,00:23:54.08,foothold. Nate down to his last bit of
368,00:24:02.25,00:24:02.25,pole left. Sundra now on that last bit of
369,00:24:09.42,00:24:09.42,rope. Not a good sign.
370,00:24:13.21,00:24:13.21,">> Come on, baby. Come on."
371,00:24:15.75,00:24:15.75,"Come on, baby. >> PROBST: Nate, third person"
372,00:24:19.04,00:24:19.04,"out of this challenge. We are down to six-- four women,"
373,00:24:22.42,00:24:22.42,two guys. Sundra taking herself back into
374,00:24:26.50,00:24:26.50,"the zone. Yul is adjusting a little,"
375,00:24:32.12,00:24:32.12,trying to figure out where he wants to settle in.
376,00:24:40.92,00:24:40.92,"Sundra, fourth person out of this challenge."
377,00:24:46.17,00:24:46.17,Candice showing off by doing some squats.
378,00:24:48.38,00:24:48.38,">> You get her on Aitutonga, and she gets wild."
379,00:24:50.96,00:24:50.96,>> PROBST: Is that your new tribe name?
380,00:24:52.62,00:24:52.62,>> Mm-hmm. >> PROBST: I like it.
381,00:24:57.58,00:24:57.58,Yul trying to dig his hands into that rope.
382,00:25:06.75,00:25:06.75,Yul starting to slide down even further.
383,00:25:14.12,00:25:14.12,"Yul, the fifth person out of this challenge."
384,00:25:17.17,00:25:17.17,"Ozzy the remaining man, three women joining him."
385,00:25:31.29,00:25:31.29,Parvati starting to slip. Rain starting to come in.
386,00:25:45.12,00:25:45.12,Becky slides down. Parvati now on her last
387,00:25:52.21,00:25:52.21,"foothold. Parvati, sixth person out of"
388,00:25:58.75,00:25:58.75,"this challenge. We are down to three -- Ozzy,"
389,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,"Becky, Candice. Right here, Candice, that's the"
390,00:26:07.25,00:26:07.25,piece of jewelry you want. >> It's pretty.
391,00:26:10.04,00:26:10.04,">> PROBST: Becky, would look good around your neck."
392,00:26:12.12,00:26:12.12,"Ozzy, it's unisex, guys or girls."
393,00:26:14.58,00:26:14.58,( laughter ) >> I like it.
394,00:26:21.58,00:26:21.58,>> Becky! >> PROBST: Becky's feet give out
395,00:26:24.75,00:26:24.75,suddenly. Becky is the seventh person out
396,00:26:27.25,00:26:27.25,"of the challenge. We are down to the final two,"
397,00:26:31.25,00:26:31.25,"Ozzy and Candice. Both obviously, want this"
398,00:26:34.25,00:26:34.25,immunity quite a bit. Rain starting to really pick up.
399,00:26:45.08,00:26:45.08,"Nate liking it. >> Rain, rain!"
400,00:26:47.08,00:26:47.08,>> PROBST: You think the rain's going to hurry this up?
401,00:26:51.58,00:26:51.58,>> We could be out here until tomorrow morning with these two.
402,00:26:54.08,00:26:54.08,"I love you, Ozzy, I love you, Candice."
403,00:26:56.79,00:26:56.79,">> PROBST: Candice makes the first move, sliding down the"
404,00:26:58.71,00:26:58.71,pole. The first move she's made in
405,00:27:10.29,00:27:10.29,over two hours. Candice sliding down a little
406,00:27:17.42,00:27:17.42,further. Candice now on the last rope
407,00:27:22.08,00:27:22.08,"foothold. Candice, drops out."
408,00:27:30.62,00:27:30.62,Ozzy wins the first individual immunity!
409,00:27:40.42,00:27:40.42,">> PROBST: Ozzy, come on over. >> I feel like an old man."
410,00:27:44.79,00:27:44.79,>> Good job. >> PROBST: Congratulations.
411,00:27:47.29,00:27:47.29,You are safe at tonight's vote. One of you going home tonight.
412,00:27:51.21,00:27:51.21,You have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
413,00:27:53.58,00:27:53.58,"Grab your stuff, head on back to camp."
414,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,See you at tribal. >> Yeah.
415,00:28:15.25,00:28:15.25,>> You did amazing. I can't believe that you stayed
416,00:28:17.04,00:28:17.04,"up so long. >> I was like, ""This is my only"
417,00:28:18.79,00:28:18.79,"chance. I've got to take it."""
418,00:28:20.75,00:28:20.75,">> After the first hour I was, like..."
419,00:28:25.33,00:28:25.33,">> I'm happy Ozzy got the immunity necklace, because I"
420,00:28:27.83,00:28:27.83,"respect him as a competitor. You know, at least he's safe for"
421,00:28:30.33,00:28:30.33,another couple of days because I like the captain.
422,00:28:33.08,00:28:33.08,"If there's a way I can work with him, I'm definitely down."
423,00:28:37.25,00:28:37.25,>> How much longer would you have stayed up there?
424,00:28:39.21,00:28:39.21,>> I think I could have kept going.
425,00:28:41.67,00:28:41.67,">> Yeah. >> Ozzy, him winning the"
426,00:28:43.71,00:28:43.71,"challenge today, is a perfect example of why we should get rid"
427,00:28:45.88,00:28:45.88,of him as soon as possible. He's the biggest threat.
428,00:28:48.96,00:28:48.96,But right now he's got immunity. So tonight our tribe is sticking
429,00:28:52.38,00:28:52.38,"together, and we're going to all vote out Yul."
430,00:28:56.25,00:28:56.25,">> Yul, you were on there for a while."
431,00:29:02.96,00:29:02.96,>> Yul is the choice because he's brilliant.
432,00:29:06.21,00:29:06.21,"He's, like, Mr. Harvard-Yale- Stanford guy."
433,00:29:09.96,00:29:09.96,"And he's also really, really strong."
434,00:29:12.58,00:29:12.58,So we just want to get him out as quickly as possible.
435,00:29:23.08,00:29:23.08,>> I got eight. >> So the hypothetical is a
436,00:29:28.92,00:29:28.92,reality. And I'm asking you for both of
437,00:29:36.29,00:29:36.29,our sakes to become my ally again.
438,00:29:39.79,00:29:39.79,>> I was not that surprised when Yul showed me the idol.
439,00:29:43.88,00:29:43.88,After our conversation yesterday it made perfect sense.
440,00:29:47.12,00:29:47.12,So now I have a lot to think about and a huge decision to
441,00:29:49.96,00:29:49.96,"make, because basically, Yul said, ""Vote with us or you're"
442,00:29:53.46,00:29:53.46,"going home tonight."" >> This is only chance we've"
443,00:29:56.88,00:29:56.88,got. Everyone recognizes that.
444,00:29:58.92,00:29:58.92,This is the only way this is going to work.
445,00:30:01.00,00:30:01.00,"I thought about it, though. I would want to go to the final"
446,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,"two with you, because, honestly, I think my chances against you"
447,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,are better than either Becky or Sundra.
448,00:30:10.12,00:30:10.12,>> I appreciate you showing that to me.
449,00:30:13.04,00:30:13.04,I have to think about it. I really do.
450,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,>> All right. >> Okay?
451,00:30:18.12,00:30:18.12,>> To be continued. >> My only concern about Yul is
452,00:30:26.21,00:30:26.21,he's the only other guy who has been to exile.
453,00:30:33.38,00:30:33.38,"Do you have the idol? >> Yul was there for, like, a"
454,00:30:36.71,00:30:36.71,day. There's no way he has it.
455,00:30:40.21,00:30:40.21,">> I floated this idea to them. I said, ""What if Yul has the"
456,00:30:42.46,00:30:42.46,"idol?"" Well, they were like, ""He"
457,00:30:44.62,00:30:44.62,"doesn't have it. He's got to go."""
458,00:30:47.25,00:30:47.25,These people aren't thinking. I don't believe they're smart
459,00:30:49.50,00:30:49.50,enough. They don't want to put the
460,00:30:51.88,00:30:51.88,mental energy into even running the scenario of what if Yul
461,00:30:54.17,00:30:54.17,"actually has it? And if I can't convince them,"
462,00:30:56.12,00:30:56.12,"Yul will play the idol, it will bounce back, and I'll be going"
463,00:30:59.38,00:30:59.38,home very early. >> Yeah!
464,00:31:08.50,00:31:08.50,>> Jonathan refuses to vote Yul off.
465,00:31:14.96,00:31:14.96,">> No, he can't come into our game and tell us what to do, you"
466,00:31:17.04,00:31:17.04,"know what I'm saying, dog? You and I are calling the shots,"
467,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,"dog. >> I know, but we need five"
468,00:31:21.67,00:31:21.67,votes. >> Okay.
469,00:31:26.25,00:31:26.25,"I mean, I agree, I just... You know what I'm saying?"
470,00:31:33.17,00:31:33.17,">> Nate's convinced we should get rid of Yul, and I'm fine"
471,00:31:36.17,00:31:36.17,"with that, but I'm concerned about Nate, just because he's"
472,00:31:39.79,00:31:39.79,"acting different recently. He's not his usual self, and"
473,00:31:44.08,00:31:44.08,"he's been hanging around Ozzy a lot, and that concerns me."
474,00:31:50.29,00:31:50.29,>> Nate just needs to chill out. >> He's just thinking too much.
475,00:31:53.58,00:31:53.58,>> We're good. And Jonathan's good.
476,00:32:21.62,00:32:21.62,">> Please understand, I have to think about this."
477,00:32:23.75,00:32:23.75,It's an extraordinarily big thing to do.
478,00:32:32.17,00:32:32.17,It's very appealing to jump over to them.
479,00:32:35.04,00:32:35.04,"On the other hand, Adam and Candice welcomed me to this"
480,00:32:38.04,00:32:38.04,"tribe, really helped me out, kept me alive here."
481,00:32:40.71,00:32:40.71,"I would hate to betray them, because if I do that, it makes"
482,00:32:45.08,00:32:45.08,me the guy who betrayed every single person in the game at one
483,00:32:48.50,00:32:48.50,"time or another. Basically, Yul said, ""We'll pick"
484,00:32:59.08,00:32:59.08,"whoever you want to go."" And since I feel some loyalty to"
485,00:33:01.96,00:33:01.96,"Adam, I said Nate, who I trust the least, because I know him"
486,00:33:05.88,00:33:05.88,the least. >> You guys have to think about
487,00:33:09.12,00:33:09.12,that. >> It's entirely possible that
488,00:33:23.04,00:33:23.04,Jonathan's pretending to go along with the plan in order to
489,00:33:25.50,00:33:25.50,direct the vote away from him onto Nate.
490,00:33:29.08,00:33:29.08,"And if he doesn't vote with us tonight, I'm going to play the"
491,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"idol, and once it's played, then I'm vulnerable."
492,00:33:35.12,00:33:35.12,I don't want to do that. So I don't know.
493,00:33:37.25,00:33:37.25,I'm hoping somehow all this clicks together.
494,00:33:53.96,00:33:53.96,">> Either way, people are going to be pissed."
495,00:33:56.08,00:33:56.08,Either I'll have betrayed the Raro people and I'm a complete
496,00:33:58.12,00:33:58.12,"bastard, or I didn't jump over to the Aitu people, and I'm a"
497,00:34:01.79,00:34:01.79,complete bastard who screwed them twice.
498,00:34:06.12,00:34:06.12,I don't know what I'm going to do.
499,00:34:08.25,00:34:08.25,I wish I knew. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
500,00:34:32.04,00:34:32.04,"the members of the jury. Brad, Rebecca, and Jenny, both"
501,00:34:38.04,00:34:38.04,voted out at the last tribal council.
502,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,"Jonathan, how did the merge change this game?"
503,00:34:50.38,00:34:50.38,">> Well, the very least of it is the sleeping accommodations have"
504,00:34:53.50,00:34:53.50,"been hard. There's nine in a tent, and"
505,00:34:56.08,00:34:56.08,we've all had to get used to living together after so many
506,00:34:58.50,00:34:58.50,weeks of vying with each other like this.
507,00:35:01.92,00:35:01.92,">> PROBST: Sundra, how did the game change from your"
508,00:35:04.29,00:35:04.29,"perspective? >> Well, the game changed in"
509,00:35:06.58,00:35:06.58,that we have to start thinking individually as well as still
510,00:35:10.25,00:35:10.25,"thinking within your alliances, your former tribemates."
511,00:35:13.12,00:35:13.12,"There's a lot of time with... with these people, so you can't"
512,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33,"help but be bonded. >> PROBST: Nate, tribal lines"
513,00:35:21.00,00:35:21.00,still in play? >> Yeah.
514,00:35:23.58,00:35:23.58,"Oh, definitely. It's like we've all made it to a"
515,00:35:25.58,00:35:25.58,"certain point. But, kind of, we're kind of"
516,00:35:27.33,00:35:27.33,"starting all over, so you're going to definitely stick to"
517,00:35:29.17,00:35:29.17,"what you're comfortable with, and those who know you, and"
518,00:35:31.42,00:35:31.42,"those who you know. >> PROBST: Yul, so if that's the"
519,00:35:34.08,00:35:34.08,"case, then Aitu is down in numbers."
520,00:35:36.79,00:35:36.79,>> The likelihood that all four of us are here at all is very
521,00:35:40.25,00:35:40.25,"low, but we stuck together, and prevailed against the odds."
522,00:35:43.88,00:35:43.88,"But the fact remains, you know, both tribes are tight, and so we"
523,00:35:47.42,00:35:47.42,"came in at a huge disadvantage, and the odds are still stacked"
524,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00,against us. So I don't know what our fate is
525,00:35:52.25,00:35:52.25,going to be. I feel like tonight is going to
526,00:35:54.25,00:35:54.25,"be pivotal. >> PROBST: Becky, do you see any"
527,00:35:56.96,00:35:56.96,"bonds, people that are closer maybe than you'd like them to"
528,00:36:00.33,00:36:00.33,be? >> I definitely felt bonds
529,00:36:03.42,00:36:03.42,"between those two. And they're very close, just"
530,00:36:05.83,00:36:05.83,"body language. So when he came over here, we"
531,00:36:08.83,00:36:08.83,sort of saw that. >> The closest bond out here is
532,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,"those two right now. >> Becky, you and Yul, y'all"
533,00:36:14.21,00:36:14.21,come on! You trippin'.
534,00:36:16.71,00:36:16.71,>> But it was different. I don't want lie on his lap.
535,00:36:19.00,00:36:19.00,"It's just a different bond, different body language."
536,00:36:21.21,00:36:21.21,">> PROBST: Parvati, what's going on between Adam and Candice?"
537,00:36:23.62,00:36:23.62,>> They love each other. They want to make babies.
538,00:36:26.50,00:36:26.50,They snuggle next to each other in the shelter.
539,00:36:30.08,00:36:30.08,I got booted out of my spot. >> You told me you left because
540,00:36:33.04,00:36:33.04,"he wasn't snugly, he wasn't paying enough attention to you."
541,00:36:36.71,00:36:36.71,">> There are two sides of me. I mean, they can both snuggle up"
542,00:36:39.04,00:36:39.04,"with me if they like. >> PROBST: Jonathan, does it"
543,00:36:41.71,00:36:41.71,concern you a little bit to see two people pairing up in a way
544,00:36:44.67,00:36:44.67,that's different than you and Ozzy might become friends?
545,00:36:48.50,00:36:48.50,>> Ah! >> Certainly different than me
546,00:36:52.62,00:36:52.62,and Ozzy. I think they really are enjoying
547,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,"each other's company, but, honestly, I do not see that it"
548,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,has moved into some kind of romantic situation.
549,00:37:02.04,00:37:02.04,"And to answer, no, it doesn't concern me."
550,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,">> PROBST: Ozzy, how will this game be different after"
551,00:37:07.17,00:37:07.17,tonight's vote? >> I think this will definitely
552,00:37:10.04,00:37:10.04,"set something in motion. You know, either it's going to"
553,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,"just go downhill for Aitu, or, you know, something crazy could"
554,00:37:16.21,00:37:16.21,"happen. At this point, I think we're"
555,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,"definitely at a pivotal moment. >> PROBST: Nate, do you think"
556,00:37:22.00,00:37:22.00,the dynamic will be different when you guys go back to camp
557,00:37:24.54,00:37:24.54,"tonight? >> Yeah, it's definitely going"
558,00:37:27.12,00:37:27.12,to stir up the waters. If someone from Raro decided to
559,00:37:31.21,00:37:31.21,"jump over, the cat's going to be out of the bag."
560,00:37:35.12,00:37:35.12,Or if someone from Aitu... because pretty much both tribes
