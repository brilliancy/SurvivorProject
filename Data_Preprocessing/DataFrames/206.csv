2,00:00:03.10,00:00:03.10,Sparks flew between Kimmi and Alicia.
3,00:00:04.60,00:00:04.60,>> KIMMI: Don't wave your finger in my face.
4,00:00:06.03,00:00:06.03,>> ALICIA: I will always wave my finger...
5,00:00:07.47,00:00:07.47,">> KIMMI: What have I said about the chickens, though, nothing!"
6,00:00:09.33,00:00:09.33,>> ALICIA: I'm tired of and you the ( bleep ) chickens!
7,00:00:11.07,00:00:11.07,( bird squawks ) >> JEFF: Ogakor had their own
8,00:00:13.23,00:00:13.23,problems-- they kept losing challenges.
9,00:00:14.80,00:00:14.80,>> AMBER: I'm so tired of losing.
10,00:00:16.70,00:00:16.70,>> JEFF: But a pep talk from Colby fired up the troops.
11,00:00:19.57,00:00:19.57,>> COLBY: It is going to take every ounce of strength.
12,00:00:22.47,00:00:22.47,It is going to be one hell of a show today.
13,00:00:24.63,00:00:24.63,>> JEFF: Survivors ready! Go!
14,00:00:26.47,00:00:26.47,>> Get it. >> Where is it? Here it is.
15,00:00:28.97,00:00:28.97,">> JEFF: After a long losing streak, Ogakor rebounded and"
16,00:00:31.07,00:00:31.07,regained the immunity idol. >> TINA: We're out.
17,00:00:33.13,00:00:33.13,( screaming happily ) >> JEFF: So Kucha made the hike
18,00:00:35.37,00:00:35.37,"to Tribal Council. Next vote, Kimmi."
19,00:00:38.20,00:00:38.20,The tribe has spoken. Eleven remain.
20,00:00:41.53,00:00:41.53,Who will be voted out tonight? ( thunder crashing )
21,00:01:51.17,00:01:51.17,">> ALICIA: Wow, you guys. >> ELISABETH: Oh, my God."
22,00:01:55.57,00:01:55.57,"Did we find the matches? ( thunder crashing, rain"
23,00:01:57.80,00:01:57.80,"pouring ) >> RODGER: The rain, yes."
24,00:02:01.50,00:02:01.50,"We got to Tribal Council last night, hadn't been there"
25,00:02:04.10,00:02:04.10,"probably five minutes, I guess, and then all of a sudden, here"
26,00:02:07.20,00:02:07.20,comes... the heaviest rain we've had since we've been here.
27,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,"I mean, it really came down. Put our fire out."
28,00:02:12.87,00:02:12.87,So then we had to use one of our matches to light a candle in our
29,00:02:16.53,00:02:16.53,hut. Got the candles going and
30,00:02:18.60,00:02:18.60,"searched through and found the very warmest, well, not the"
31,00:02:21.77,00:02:21.77,"warmest, but really the driest clothes that we had."
32,00:02:24.63,00:02:24.63,A lot of us had wore our clothes to Tribal Council that we'd been
33,00:02:28.07,00:02:28.07,"used to sleeping in. I know I did, for one."
34,00:02:30.63,00:02:30.63,That was a mistake. ( thunder crashing )
35,00:02:33.77,00:02:33.77,">> ELISABETH: Oh, my God! This is crazy."
36,00:02:35.90,00:02:35.90,Is that coming in from the outside?
37,00:02:37.57,00:02:37.57,">> JEFF V.: Yeah, I think it is. >> ELISABETH: Oh!"
38,00:02:40.80,00:02:40.80,">> JEFF V.: Oh, my God. It's coming in hard."
39,00:02:43.03,00:02:43.03,This is going to suck. >> ELISABETH: When it rains
40,00:02:47.87,00:02:47.87,"here, it means you're cold at night, you don't sleep."
41,00:02:51.90,00:02:51.90,"Rain is... I mean, it puts you in such an extreme disadvantage."
42,00:02:59.20,00:02:59.20,It's... it takes you a day to recover from rain.
43,00:03:01.33,00:03:01.33,"I mean, there's a risk of getting sick, you're sleeping in"
44,00:03:03.83,00:03:03.83,"the cold, wet. There's nothing worse than the"
45,00:03:06.57,00:03:06.57,rain here. ( thunder crashing )
46,00:03:08.50,00:03:08.50,Nothing worse. 'Cause being cold is guaranteed
47,00:03:11.50,00:03:11.50,at night. But cold and wet?
48,00:03:13.47,00:03:13.47,Stick a fork in me. It stinks.
49,00:03:18.60,00:03:18.60,">> JEFF V.: Good night, Jim Bob. ( scattered chuckling )"
50,00:03:21.67,00:03:21.67,">> ALICIA ( chuckles ): Shut up. ""Jim Bob."""
51,00:03:25.70,00:03:25.70,"( thunder crashing, rain pouring )"
52,00:03:26.83,00:03:26.83,>> JEFF V.: I love this place. You gotta love it.
53,00:03:30.93,00:03:30.93,( thunder echoing ) >> MICHAEL: It's amazing how you
54,00:03:40.67,00:03:40.67,"can live off the land, eight city people can come out here"
55,00:03:45.40,00:03:45.40,and live off the land. It's amazing.
56,00:03:48.00,00:03:48.00,"Not only food wise, but shelter wise and safety wise, and, um,"
57,00:03:52.37,00:03:52.37,heat wise. And starting a fire this morning
58,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,with wet wood. It's just amazing to me.
59,00:03:59.97,00:03:59.97,It's a whole... my outlook on life has changed 180 degrees.
60,00:04:03.87,00:04:03.87,"And I'm this kind of guy. I'm this kind... you know, this"
61,00:04:08.23,00:04:08.23,"should be nothing for me. But, uh, I am a changed man"
62,00:04:11.27,00:04:11.27,"already, after 16 days. Very changed."
63,00:04:14.50,00:04:14.50,"And if I last another 16 days, who knows what's going to happen"
64,00:04:20.73,00:04:20.73,to me. >> ALICIA: Today is day 16.
65,00:04:25.70,00:04:25.70,"We are thinking ahead now to, uh, the merger."
66,00:04:30.60,00:04:30.60,We have four more days until that happens.
67,00:04:32.63,00:04:32.63,>> JEFF V.: We started with 16 people.
68,00:04:35.20,00:04:35.20,Six people are voted out of the outback.
69,00:04:37.83,00:04:37.83,"Then when it gets to ten people, everybody comes together into"
70,00:04:41.13,00:04:41.13,"one tribe and the game, all of a sudden, becomes every man for"
71,00:04:44.07,00:04:44.07,himself. >> NICK: There's one more
72,00:04:46.30,00:04:46.30,"immunity challenge left, we have six and they have five, and, uh,"
73,00:04:50.07,00:04:50.07,that's a huge advantage because the pressure is on them to win
74,00:04:53.80,00:04:53.80,"the next challenge, and, uh, we're really hoping to go into"
75,00:04:57.27,00:04:57.27,"the merger six to four, and that way we could basically pick them"
76,00:05:01.43,00:05:01.43,off one by one. >> JEFF V.: We are a very cocky
77,00:05:07.27,00:05:07.27,group. It's fun to beat them and make
78,00:05:09.53,00:05:09.53,fun of it. It's fun to have them talk about
79,00:05:13.03,00:05:13.03,"how hungry they are, and us go in there and win all their food."
80,00:05:16.17,00:05:16.17,"That's fun! >> AMBER: Oh, my God, I'm so"
81,00:05:24.93,00:05:24.93,hungry. >> JERRI: There's enough in here
82,00:05:27.37,00:05:27.37,for... >> AMBER: I'd say three
83,00:05:29.17,00:05:29.17,"tortillas. >> JERRI: Yeah, I could get"
84,00:05:31.53,00:05:31.53,"three tortillas out of that, but I'd say we go two."
85,00:05:34.13,00:05:34.13,">> AMBER: Oh, my God. ( Jerri laughs softly )"
86,00:05:38.47,00:05:38.47,And to think the other tribe is eating eggs.
87,00:05:40.53,00:05:40.53,">> JERRI: Bastards. And soup, and spices."
88,00:05:44.90,00:05:44.90,">> AMBER: And chicken, and pig. >> JERRI: I just, at some point,"
89,00:05:48.73,00:05:48.73,have to get my hands on some chocolate.
90,00:05:53.73,00:05:53.73,I fear I might go psycho. And I'm not kidding.
91,00:05:57.50,00:05:57.50,I had a discussion with Colby regarding chocolate and how
92,00:06:00.37,00:06:00.37,"chocolate releases the same endorphins that sex does, and"
93,00:06:05.97,00:06:05.97,"since none of us are having sex, that that's probably why we keep"
94,00:06:09.60,00:06:09.60,reverting to the chocolate discussions.
95,00:06:12.00,00:06:12.00,I'm going to bathe myself in chocolate.
96,00:06:17.77,00:06:17.77,>> AMBER: I can't get over... I just want to bite into one of
97,00:06:20.73,00:06:20.73,"those so bad, it's unbelievable. Like a peppermint patty."
98,00:06:24.27,00:06:24.27,">> JERRI: Right now, I can actually, in my wildest fantasy,"
99,00:06:28.30,00:06:28.30,picture pouring hot chocolate all over...
100,00:06:32.40,00:06:32.40,some hot dude's bod and having sex while licking it off at the
101,00:06:36.50,00:06:36.50,same time. That's like my ultimate fantasy
102,00:06:39.43,00:06:39.43,right now. >> AMBER: It's like when you
103,00:06:42.03,00:06:42.03,pull apart the chocolate... ( Jerri squeals in frustration )
104,00:06:46.07,00:06:46.07,( Amber laughs softly ) >> COLBY: When you're asleep at
105,00:06:48.53,00:06:48.53,"night in the tent, and you hear moaning and groaning about"
106,00:06:51.30,00:06:51.30,"Hershey Kisses, you know what's really going on though."
107,00:06:54.90,00:06:54.90,It ain't about the chocolate. >> JERRI: Vanilla ice cream...
108,00:06:57.17,00:06:57.17,">> AMBER: Oh, my God. >> JERRI: ...with hot fudge"
109,00:06:59.30,00:06:59.30,trickled all over the top! >> AMBER: Yes!
110,00:07:01.03,00:07:01.03,( both scream happily ) >> COLBY: She's using her
111,00:07:04.60,00:07:04.60,thoughts of chocolate to substitute for her thoughts of
112,00:07:06.77,00:07:06.77,sex. It's just making for a very
113,00:07:08.73,00:07:08.73,uncomfortable camping trip. >> AMBER: Peppermint Pattie!
114,00:07:11.53,00:07:11.53,>> JERRI: I think Colby's afraid of me.
115,00:07:13.60,00:07:13.60,Because this fantasy I have about chocolate and sex
116,00:07:16.33,00:07:16.33,"definitely involves him. Oh, God, I can't take."
117,00:07:18.90,00:07:18.90,I can't take it anymore! >> COLBY: I may be a lot of
118,00:07:23.47,00:07:23.47,"things, but I ain't no Hershey bar."
119,00:07:25.47,00:07:25.47,( laughing ) >> JERRI: Snickers!
120,00:07:29.37,00:07:29.37,">> AMBER: Kit Kat, Milky Way, M&Ms!"
121,00:07:31.97,00:07:31.97,Reese's Cup! A meatball sub!
122,00:07:36.23,00:07:36.23,">> JERRI: Oh, yeah! I love those!"
123,00:07:38.70,00:07:38.70,>> COLBY: This is ridiculous man.
124,00:07:40.67,00:07:40.67,"They're driving me nuts. ( girls yelling, bongo playing )"
125,00:07:42.63,00:07:42.63,"Bring on... get rid of these goons, and let's get"
126,00:07:46.23,00:07:46.23,something going. This is crazy.
127,00:07:47.87,00:07:47.87,"( Jerri laughing ) >> AMBER: Oh, my God!"
128,00:07:54.20,00:07:54.20,">> COLBY: Hey, girls, guess what's for dinner?"
129,00:07:55.83,00:07:55.83,( Jerri laughs ) >> BOTH: Rice.
130,00:07:57.30,00:07:57.30,>> COLBY: We're having white rice.
131,00:07:58.73,00:07:58.73,( both moan ) ( bongo plays )
132,00:08:18.73,00:08:18.73,"( chicken clucks softly ) >> ELISABETH: Chicken feed, huh?"
133,00:08:24.10,00:08:24.10,>> RODGER: I really don't think there's a thing in there that
134,00:08:25.97,00:08:25.97,will hurt you. >> ELISABETH: I think it would
135,00:08:28.10,00:08:28.10,"probably be better cooked, we know it's clean... after I eat a"
136,00:08:30.70,00:08:30.70,"handful. I just wonder if it's been,"
137,00:08:33.97,00:08:33.97,"like, stepped on and stuff by other chickens, and..."
138,00:08:36.77,00:08:36.77,">> RODGER: Well, if it's cooked..."
139,00:08:38.20,00:08:38.20,">> ALICIA: That's good, actually."
140,00:08:40.27,00:08:40.27,">> ELISABETH: Actually, not bad. ( Michael speaks indistinctly )"
141,00:08:49.13,00:08:49.13,">> ALICIA: Chicken feed. We bring back the chicken, the"
142,00:08:55.87,00:08:55.87,"rooster, the chicken feed, and of course, in true Kucha style,"
143,00:09:01.50,00:09:01.50,we're trying to figure out how we can utilize every single
144,00:09:04.73,00:09:04.73,"little thing we brought back. Elisabeth and I said, ""Can we"
145,00:09:08.63,00:09:08.63,"eat that?"" Because it just looks like nuts"
146,00:09:11.93,00:09:11.93,"and grains and corn and wheat, and, you know, it just looks so"
147,00:09:16.30,00:09:16.30,"good to us for some reason. And he told us, you know, he's"
148,00:09:19.93,00:09:19.93,"like, ""Yeah, it's good for you."" >> MICHAEL: Ow, ow, ow, ow."
149,00:09:22.70,00:09:22.70,"Yeow. You guys, it's popping."
150,00:09:24.87,00:09:24.87,You guys should see this stuff. It's popping like popcorn.
151,00:09:28.63,00:09:28.63,"You guys, come here quick. It is popcorn!"
152,00:09:31.53,00:09:31.53,"It's popcorn! It's cracking, it's popping."
153,00:09:35.23,00:09:35.23,>> ALICIA: Can you believe that? It is popcorn.
154,00:09:37.17,00:09:37.17,It's popcorn. There's popcorn in this pan.
155,00:09:41.20,00:09:41.20,This camp just gets better and better every minute.
156,00:09:43.17,00:09:43.17,>> MICHAEL: Ow! Wow! Ow.
157,00:09:46.70,00:09:46.70,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. >> JEFF V.: I don't know about"
158,00:09:50.80,00:09:50.80,"this chicken pop feed, whatever. I just... I don't know."
159,00:09:54.43,00:09:54.43,"It's good, and I hated it, the whole thought of eating chicken"
160,00:09:57.33,00:09:57.33,"feed just made me sick. But the more I eat it, the"
161,00:10:00.83,00:10:00.83,better it gets. >> ALICIA: Do you love it?
162,00:10:04.03,00:10:04.03,">> JEFF V.: Oh, my God. >> ALICIA: That just, we--"
163,00:10:06.93,00:10:06.93,forget it. We are now addicted.

165,00:10:11.53,00:10:11.53,">> ALICIA: And we have, like, chicken popcorn."

168,00:10:17.50,00:10:17.50,"( thunder crashing ) At night, we make it."
169,00:10:19.80,00:10:19.80,"And we're going to find out, like, somewhere down the road"
170,00:10:22.73,00:10:22.73,"that, like, something was in it, and we're going to have like"
171,00:10:25.63,00:10:25.63,"eight nipples and laying eggs, and I don't know, but until that"
172,00:10:28.80,00:10:28.80,"happens, I'm going to keep eating it because it's so good."
173,00:10:31.80,00:10:31.80,It's so good. >> MICHAEL: Let's kill those
174,00:10:33.97,00:10:33.97,chickens so they don't eat any more feed.
175,00:10:35.70,00:10:35.70,( Michael laughing ) ( chicken clucking )
176,00:10:47.93,00:10:47.93,>> KEITH: Jerri and Amber went to pick some tomatoes.
177,00:10:51.00,00:10:51.00,"Jerri has, um, decided she wants to do fried green tomatoes, but"
178,00:10:54.43,00:10:54.43,they're cherry tomato. >> JERRI: But I can tantalize
179,00:10:57.40,00:10:57.40,our taste buds with fried green tomatoes this evening.
180,00:11:01.60,00:11:01.60,>> AMBER: Getting creative. >> JERRI: Have to.
181,00:11:05.63,00:11:05.63,>> COLBY: Thank you. >> JERRI: They aren't quite as
182,00:11:09.03,00:11:09.03,"ripe, but... >> KEITH: You don't do fried"
183,00:11:11.00,00:11:11.00,green tomatoes with cherry tomatoes.
184,00:11:12.67,00:11:12.67,My thought was maybe leave them on the vine just another couple
185,00:11:15.27,00:11:15.27,"days, they'll be nice and bright red and real juicy and good to"
