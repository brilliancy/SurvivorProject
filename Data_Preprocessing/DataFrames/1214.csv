85,00:04:21.21,00:04:21.21,"then you start an argument... >> It was right in front of me,"
86,00:04:23.42,00:04:23.42,"where I was walking. After a few minutes, when we"
87,00:04:25.71,00:04:25.71,"joined up at the fire, I became the pin cushion and all three"
88,00:04:28.46,00:04:28.46,ganged up on me on how inconsiderate it was for me to
89,00:04:31.71,00:04:31.71,tell Cirie not to drop a piece of equipment right in front of
90,00:04:34.17,00:04:34.17,me. >> We could've come back here
91,00:04:36.25,00:04:36.25,"and celebrated our final four, but you knocked Cirie right"
92,00:04:38.67,00:04:38.67,"away-- first thing you do. >> All right, all right."
93,00:04:41.29,00:04:41.29,"That's fine, that's fine. And you know what?"
94,00:04:42.92,00:04:42.92,"You guys, maybe I'll go to bed and you can have your little"

96,00:04:47.62,00:04:47.62,"It doesn't matter to me. >> Oh, man."
97,00:04:50.75,00:04:50.75,I didn't come here to make friends with 24-year-olds.
98,00:04:53.75,00:04:53.75,They haven't made it easy for me.
99,00:04:55.42,00:04:55.42,The target's been on my back. I've been the underdog the whole
100,00:04:57.42,00:04:57.42,"time. >> Congratulations, final four."
101,00:05:00.04,00:05:00.04,>> I know. >> The three of us did it.
102,00:05:02.25,00:05:02.25,>> You know what? If nobody talks to me for the
103,00:05:04.21,00:05:04.21,"next five days, I could give... I'm winning the million dollars"
104,00:05:06.12,00:05:06.12,and that's all. >> That's all it is.

110,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,unclip from one rope to another as you navigate your way
111,00:05:51.25,00:05:51.25,around each other along a main thoroughfare that leads to six
112,00:05:54.79,00:05:54.79,"stations-- holes, hermit crabs rocks, iguanas, shells and fish."

116,00:06:12.08,00:06:12.08,"stations, you will have six numbers."
117,00:06:14.88,00:06:14.88,You'll then place those six numbers into an answer grid.
118,00:06:18.21,00:06:18.21,Using the combinations of the two numbers in each column will
119,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,"open the locks. If a lock doesn't open, it means"
120,00:06:24.12,00:06:24.12,you counted wrong. You can head back out and
121,00:06:26.54,00:06:26.54,correct your mistakes. Once you've opened all three
122,00:06:29.04,00:06:29.04,"locks, the tribe flag will drop. First person to lower their"
123,00:06:31.92,00:06:31.92,"tribe flag, wins reward. What to know what you're playing"

191,00:10:49.21,00:10:49.21,">> Yeah, man. Whoa! >> You pushed me first, Aras."
192,00:10:51.12,00:10:51.12,"You pushed me first. >> PROBST: Whoa, easy guys,"
193,00:10:52.62,00:10:52.62,easy. >> Pull.
194,00:10:54.21,00:10:54.21,">> Terry, you pull it. >> Keep your hands off."
195,00:10:56.25,00:10:56.25,">> PROBST: Two battering rams. >> Oh, my..."
196,00:10:58.12,00:10:58.12,>> PROBST: Aras now tied up with Cirie.
197,00:11:00.08,00:11:00.08,"Terry now with a bit of a lead. >> Oh, oh, my rope..."
198,00:11:04.08,00:11:04.08,>> PROBST: Terry first back to his box.
199,00:11:06.12,00:11:06.12,">> Dee, go around me! >> PROBST: Aras back now."
200,00:11:11.08,00:11:11.08,It's Terry and Aras. Do they have the right six
201,00:11:13.08,00:11:13.08,numbers? Both trying to solve the
202,00:11:14.88,00:11:14.88,combinations. Three locks.
203,00:11:16.88,00:11:16.88,">> Six, seven, eight. >> PROBST: Cirie and Danielle,"
204,00:11:19.21,00:11:19.21,you're not out of it till they get their locks open.
205,00:11:23.08,00:11:23.08,Aras has figured out his first lock.
206,00:11:25.75,00:11:25.75,Cirie back with her sixth number.
207,00:11:30.58,00:11:30.58,Danielle now back. She's in it.
208,00:11:33.08,00:11:33.08,"Suddenly, Cirie and Danielle have a shot."
209,00:11:41.08,00:11:41.08,Terry's figured out his first lock.
210,00:11:47.04,00:11:47.04,Cirie has her first lock undone. Danielle has her first lock
211,00:11:53.21,00:11:53.21,open. Everybody working on their
212,00:11:57.58,00:11:57.58,second locks. Everybody in this.
213,00:12:00.88,00:12:00.88,Anybody could win it. You think you have a number
214,00:12:04.08,00:12:04.08,"wrong, go back. Cirie and Terry heading back out"
215,00:12:07.21,00:12:07.21,for a second look. >> Go back there.
216,00:12:10.12,00:12:10.12,>> PROBST: Aras going to head back out.
217,00:12:12.08,00:12:12.08,"Danielle all alone now. If she's right, she could win"
218,00:12:15.08,00:12:15.08,it. >> Three...
219,00:12:21.12,00:12:21.12,>> PROBST: Terry coming back. Thinks he has the answer now.
220,00:12:24.29,00:12:24.29,Danielle heading back out on the course for a second look.
221,00:12:27.50,00:12:27.50,Seems nobody thinks they got it right.
222,00:12:30.25,00:12:30.25,"Terry's still fighting it, still not getting it."
223,00:12:34.17,00:12:34.17,Cirie and Aras have been gone a long time.
224,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,Terry heading back out for a third look.
225,00:12:43.54,00:12:43.54,>> Don't you have to come back after each look once you're out
226,00:12:45.54,00:12:45.54,there? Aras should have been back here
227,00:12:47.54,00:12:47.54,already. He's taking multiple looks.
228,00:12:49.54,00:12:49.54,">> PROBST: No, Terry, you're good."
229,00:12:51.25,00:12:51.25,>> I can take multiple looks? >> PROBST: Yes!
230,00:12:53.33,00:12:53.33,">> Oh, you didn't tell us that. Was one look and back to the"
231,00:12:56.25,00:12:56.25,station. >> Somebody call an ambulance.
232,00:12:58.88,00:12:58.88,"Terry's crying on the course. >> Well, I had to take over your"
233,00:13:01.50,00:13:01.50,role. >> PROBST: Aras is back.
234,00:13:03.54,00:13:03.54,"Did he get it right this time? Danielle, Cirie, Terry, you are"
235,00:13:08.92,00:13:08.92,still in it. Aras opens his second lock.
236,00:13:14.17,00:13:14.17,Aras with one lock left. Aras has his third lock undone!
237,00:13:28.12,00:13:28.12,Aras wins reward! >> Yes!
238,00:13:32.67,00:13:32.67,>> Good on you. Good on you.
239,00:13:34.54,00:13:34.54,"You-you got whatever he said, and I missed it."
240,00:13:38.04,00:13:38.04,"Let me get this straight. The first time out, we were only"
241,00:13:40.04,00:13:40.04,"allowed one pass, come back and get the numbers."
242,00:13:42.12,00:13:42.12,">> PROBST: Yes. >> Well, the second time I"
243,00:13:43.92,00:13:43.92,"came back, you know, I didn't... I didn't have to come back."
244,00:13:45.75,00:13:45.75,I could have got... stayed out there.
245,00:13:47.50,00:13:47.50,">> I got a question, Terry. Every time somebody else wins,"
246,00:13:49.12,00:13:49.12,are you going to say you got hosed?
247,00:13:50.79,00:13:50.79,"It that how it's going to be? >> Uh, that's the only... first"
248,00:13:52.25,00:13:52.25,"time I lost, so there you go, Aras."
249,00:13:54.08,00:13:54.08,>> Are you serious? >> Right back at you.
250,00:13:55.21,00:13:55.21,">> 'Cause every time you don't win something, you complain"
251,00:13:57.08,00:13:57.08,"about it, every time. >> Right back at you..."
252,00:13:58.58,00:13:58.58,>> You have no respect for anybody else out here.
253,00:14:00.04,00:14:00.04,>> Keep it up. >> What are you going to do?
254,00:14:02.12,00:14:02.12,Say something bad about women? Do I have to worry about that?
255,00:14:04.12,00:14:04.12,">> Oh, there you go. That always works."
256,00:14:06.00,00:14:06.00,That's a real mature comeback. (Aras scoffs)
257,00:14:09.17,00:14:09.17,(Terry sighs) >> PROBST: Aras?
258,00:14:12.08,00:14:12.08,>> Yo. >> PROBST: Come on over.
259,00:14:13.83,00:14:13.83,Congratulations. >> Thank you.
260,00:14:16.12,00:14:16.12,>> PROBST: Okay. Tour the Panama Canal.
261,00:14:19.21,00:14:19.21,"Hundred-foot luxury yacht, five-course meal, open bar and"
262,00:14:22.54,00:14:22.54,an overnight stay. You're bringing one person with
263,00:14:25.04,00:14:25.04,you. The other two people who do not
264,00:14:27.96,00:14:27.96,go on the reward will go to Exile Island.
265,00:14:30.12,00:14:30.12,(Cirie gasps) So the name I want is the person
266,00:14:33.33,00:14:33.33,who is going with you on the reward.
267,00:14:37.08,00:14:37.08,>> Cirie. >> PROBST: Cirie.
268,00:14:40.25,00:14:40.25,">> Thank you! >> Sorry, Dee."
269,00:14:43.21,00:14:43.21,"Sorry, Terry. >> Got to do what you got to do,"
270,00:14:45.38,00:14:45.38,"man. >> PROBST: Danielle, heading"
271,00:14:47.21,00:14:47.21,"right back to Exile Island. Terry, been there several times"
272,00:14:50.25,00:14:50.25,yourself. Grab your stuff.
273,00:14:52.04,00:14:52.04,Boat's waiting. (engine humming)
274,00:15:03.08,00:15:03.08,">> Cirie, we're going on a yacht, and then we're going to"
275,00:15:05.08,00:15:05.08,"go see the Panama Canal, but, most importantly, we're going to"
276,00:15:07.08,00:15:07.08,eat. (Cirie laughs)
277,00:15:11.12,00:15:11.12,>> Winning my first individual reward challenge was really big
278,00:15:15.04,00:15:15.04,for me psychologically. The reward was a five-course
279,00:15:18.12,00:15:18.12,dinner on a yacht through the Panama Canal.
280,00:15:27.08,00:15:27.08,(boat horn toots) (man speaking Spanish)
281,00:15:33.46,00:15:33.46,>> Gracias. >> Okay.
282,00:15:36.25,00:15:36.25,>> I was totally excited about being picked.
283,00:15:39.04,00:15:39.04,"I've seen yachts on TV, in music videos..."
284,00:15:41.67,00:15:41.67,(Cirie giggles) ...but never in my wildest
285,00:15:44.21,00:15:44.21,dreams would I have ever thought I myself would be on a yacht.
286,00:15:49.50,00:15:49.50,">> Cirie, cheers. >> Cheers to you, Aras!"
287,00:15:51.67,00:15:51.67,>> Final four. >> Final four.
288,00:15:53.50,00:15:53.50,">> And hopefully, both of us make it final three."
289,00:15:55.21,00:15:55.21,>> I know. Final two. Why you joking?
290,00:15:57.04,00:15:57.04,">> Yeah, final two. >> Damn, that is huge."
291,00:16:02.71,00:16:02.71,"Damn, that's big! You can fit my house in there."
292,00:16:06.96,00:16:06.96,">> If you couldn't fit your house in there, Cirie, I"
293,00:16:09.17,00:16:09.17,wouldn't let you win the million dollars.
294,00:16:10.88,00:16:10.88,"Let me tell you that right now. The situation with Terry is, I"
295,00:16:15.25,00:16:15.25,"see him whining, and I'm, like, ""Oh, Terry's whining,"" and I"
296,00:16:17.25,00:16:17.25,make fun of him. >> What was he saying at that
297,00:16:19.25,00:16:19.25,time? What he say...?
298,00:16:21.08,00:16:21.08,">> ""Jeff, Aras should be back by now."""
299,00:16:23.12,00:16:23.12,"(Cirie laughing) ""Aras should be back!"
300,00:16:24.96,00:16:24.96,"He's looking at two in one trip."""
301,00:16:26.67,00:16:26.67,>> Is that what he said? >> Yeah.
302,00:16:28.46,00:16:28.46,"(Cirie laughs) And I yelled out, ""Somebody call"
303,00:16:31.12,00:16:31.12,"an ambulance. Terry's crying on the course."""
304,00:16:33.21,00:16:33.21,"It was huge to beat Terry at the reward challenge, but for me,"
305,00:16:37.46,00:16:37.46,"what I try to practice is love and-and compassion, and I"
306,00:16:40.04,00:16:40.04,haven't practiced love and compassion with Terry recently.
307,00:16:42.46,00:16:42.46,I have been... It's been ego.
308,00:16:44.58,00:16:44.58,"It's been all of my ego. >> Oh, this game is terrible."
309,00:16:46.62,00:16:46.62,>> It is. You got to take people out.
310,00:16:57.42,00:16:57.42,>> I hated that challenge today. (Terry scoffs)
311,00:16:59.46,00:16:59.46,>> You know what? The rivalry with Aras is
312,00:17:02.12,00:17:02.12,starting to get a little unhealthy.
313,00:17:03.92,00:17:03.92,"The past couple days, he's getting really, really"
314,00:17:06.08,00:17:06.08,emotional. >> Yeah.
315,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,>> And I don't know if it's... he's cracking or what.
316,00:17:12.12,00:17:12.12,Aras is kind of a hothead these days.
317,00:17:14.46,00:17:14.46,His emotions-- he's really wearing them on his sleeve.
318,00:17:16.96,00:17:16.96,"What ticked me off is, at the challenge, I was just trying to"
319,00:17:20.12,00:17:20.12,get a final ruling on how I basically messed up.
320,00:17:24.50,00:17:24.50,"And out of his mouth came, ""You always argue when you've lost."""
321,00:17:29.12,00:17:29.12,"Then he said ""Well, you know, what are you going to do, uh,"
322,00:17:33.04,00:17:33.04,"you know, make a disparaging remark about women?"""
323,00:17:35.46,00:17:35.46,I have not made a disparaging remark against a woman here.
324,00:17:39.21,00:17:39.21,"I wasn't appreciative of that, but, uh, I've got to just act"
325,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,"like a 46-year-old, try to calm it down, you know, and"
326,00:17:46.21,00:17:46.21,"hopefully, you know, there will be one more immunity challenge,"
327,00:17:49.04,00:17:49.04,"either myself or Danielle will win it, and he'll be gone."
328,00:17:51.96,00:17:51.96,>> Say you win the next immunity.
329,00:17:54.38,00:17:54.38,>> That-that would... would be a must if we... if us two want to
330,00:17:57.88,00:17:57.88,"get to the final three, and... >> Then, yeah, you would win,"
331,00:18:01.96,00:18:01.96,"and then Aras and Cirie will probably vote me, and since..."
332,00:18:04.71,00:18:04.71,>> Right. You'll have the hidden immunity
333,00:18:06.62,00:18:06.62,"idol. >> I'll have the hidden idol,"
334,00:18:08.38,00:18:08.38,because you won't be able to use it after that anyway.
335,00:18:10.21,00:18:10.21,">> Right, right, and then just..."
336,00:18:12.08,00:18:12.08,">> And then I can vote Aras off, and then Aras will be the one to"
337,00:18:13.67,00:18:13.67,go. That would be...
338,00:18:15.08,00:18:15.08,">> Right. Right, unless Cirie's got some wild hair and wants to"
339,00:18:16.88,00:18:16.88,"vote Aras off, too. >> I doubt it."
340,00:18:18.46,00:18:18.46,">> Yeah. >> They have, like, a bond."
341,00:18:20.12,00:18:20.12,>> Yeah. >> Aras ended up winning the
342,00:18:22.62,00:18:22.62,"reward challenge, and he got to pick one person to take with"
343,00:18:25.29,00:18:25.29,"him. He chose Cirie, so, therefore,"
344,00:18:29.04,00:18:29.04,that tells me that it's the right time to align myself with
345,00:18:31.50,00:18:31.50,Terry. It's gotten to the point where
346,00:18:34.04,00:18:34.04,it's like I'm going to try to use him.
347,00:18:36.67,00:18:36.67,I don't care about being his friend.
348,00:18:38.50,00:18:38.50,I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win the million
349,00:18:40.33,00:18:40.33,dollars. I can't believe you found that
350,00:18:43.25,00:18:43.25,right away. >> Terry has the hidden immunity
351,00:18:47.25,00:18:47.25,"idol. I mean, before she showed me a"
352,00:18:50.12,00:18:50.12,"little glimpse of it, but this time around, I held it in my"
353,00:18:52.25,00:18:52.25,"hands. It's 100%, and I know he is"
354,00:18:55.17,00:18:55.17,going to possibly let me use it. >> We are going to do this
355,00:18:58.71,00:18:58.71,"thing, and we're both going to shake and look each other in"
356,00:19:00.67,00:19:00.67,"the eye, and... >> No, no, I'll be..."
357,00:19:02.75,00:19:02.75,I-I will swear on it now. >> We are going to go to the
358,00:19:04.88,00:19:04.88,"finals, you and I. No matter who wins the three,"
359,00:19:07.29,00:19:07.29,"you and I will go to the finals, and that's the way we'll do it."
360,00:19:09.38,00:19:09.38,Then... >> We can't let Aras win the
361,00:19:11.29,00:19:11.29,"next immunity. >> No, uh-uh, no, we can't..."
362,00:19:13.12,00:19:13.12,>> He cannot win. >> The Panama Canal connects
363,00:19:38.92,00:19:38.92,"the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and most of the canal is like a"
364,00:19:43.29,00:19:43.29,"river, and then you get to the locks, and the locks are what"
365,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,"allow you to rise or lower, depending on where you are in"
366,00:19:49.25,00:19:49.25,"the canal, which is really cool. (bell ringing)"
367,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,>> Wow. (horn honks)
368,00:20:10.21,00:20:10.21,>> The canal-- it just was unbelievable that something man-
369,00:20:14.54,00:20:14.54,made could actually do something like that.
370,00:20:19.04,00:20:19.04,">> It's cool, huh? (Cirie chuckles)"
371,00:20:21.38,00:20:21.38,">> Right now, I'm closer to Aras than anyone out here."
372,00:20:25.29,00:20:25.29,I have been for 34 days now. >> This is my favorite time of
373,00:20:30.08,00:20:30.08,day right here. (seagulls screeching)
374,00:20:32.21,00:20:32.21,>> We're just taking it all in and thinking how nice it would
375,00:20:35.17,00:20:35.17,be if the two of us made it to the final two.
376,00:20:37.62,00:20:37.62,(horn blowing) >> Here's to the final four.
377,00:20:39.88,00:20:39.88,"(Aras mutters) Hopefully, the final two."
378,00:20:58.38,00:20:58.38,">> On the yacht, from a distance, this looks like a nice"
379,00:21:01.58,00:21:01.58,"place. I'm like, ""Wow, is that our"
380,00:21:05.58,00:21:05.58,"beach? Damn, it looks nice."
381,00:21:07.71,00:21:07.71,"""Is that where I spent the last 35 miserable days of my life?"""
382,00:21:13.38,00:21:13.38,(chuckling) But you know what?
383,00:21:16.58,00:21:16.58,"Even though I'm not the adventurous, outdoors type,"
384,00:21:20.67,00:21:20.67,it was kind of nice to come back.
385,00:21:23.42,00:21:23.42,">> Oh, that was amazing. >> That was amazing."
386,00:21:30.17,00:21:30.17,(breaking wind) >> Oh!
387,00:21:32.38,00:21:32.38,">> That's why I don't like you. >> Come on, come back here,"
388,00:21:35.21,00:21:35.21,"Cirie. >> No, it's toxic."
389,00:21:37.46,00:21:37.46,"(breaking wind) >> I'm sorry, it's that"
390,00:21:40.38,00:21:40.38,reward. (groans)
391,00:21:45.38,00:21:45.38,>> Hmm... I have never started a fire by
392,00:21:49.21,00:21:49.21,myself with the flint. I wouldn't mind trying it.
393,00:21:55.17,00:21:55.17,I don't think it's strange that I haven't started a fire by
394,00:21:58.00,00:21:58.00,myself because there's always people around jumping at the
395,00:22:00.79,00:22:00.79,"bit to start the fire, so why stop them?"
396,00:22:05.08,00:22:05.08,"If you want to start the fire, go ahead."
397,00:22:08.67,00:22:08.67,Aras would never expect me to have a fire going when he woke
398,00:22:11.92,00:22:11.92,"up, so that's why I'm trying to get it going before he wakes"
399,00:22:16.38,00:22:16.38,up. I got a fire!
400,00:22:38.25,00:22:38.25,Damn! (laughs)
401,00:22:44.71,00:22:44.71,"Oh, yeah. (laughs)"
402,00:22:47.12,00:22:47.12,I used the flint. >> Wow.
403,00:22:51.21,00:22:51.21,I'm impressed. Cirie made a fire.
404,00:22:52.75,00:22:52.75,"It's awesome. Day one, Cirie out here would"
405,00:22:55.54,00:22:55.54,"not have known what to do, and now she's come full circle."
406,00:23:00.58,00:23:00.58,">> Yeah, I got the fire. (laughs)"
407,00:23:12.79,00:23:12.79,>> PROBST: Come on in guys. Hello.
408,00:23:17.58,00:23:17.58,">> Hey, Jeff. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
409,00:23:22.96,00:23:22.96,Terry and Danielle from Exile Island.
410,00:23:34.38,00:23:34.38,"Welcome back, guys. >> Thanks."
411,00:23:36.33,00:23:36.33,"Hey. >> PROBST: Aras, how was the"
412,00:23:42.79,00:23:42.79,tour of the Panama Canal? Did you get some food in your
413,00:23:45.12,00:23:45.12,belly. >> I got a lot of food in my
414,00:23:47.04,00:23:47.04,"belly, Jeff. I ate almost too much."
415,00:23:49.83,00:23:49.83,>> PROBST: Feel energized for today's challenge?
416,00:23:51.92,00:23:51.92,">> Yeah, I feel great. >> PROBST: Ready to get to"
417,00:23:53.92,00:23:53.92,today's challenge? >> Yeah.
418,00:23:54.92,00:23:54.92,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
419,00:23:55.50,00:23:55.50,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: First thing's first.
420,00:24:00.50,00:24:00.50,"After five straight individual immunity wins by Terry, once"
421,00:24:06.04,00:24:06.04,again immunity is back up for grabs.
422,00:24:09.17,00:24:09.17,"For today's challenge, you will work to solve three puzzles."
423,00:24:12.12,00:24:12.12,"Here's how it works. Using a set of coordinates,"
424,00:24:15.21,00:24:15.21,you'll cross two ropes. Where the ropes intersect
425,00:24:19.08,00:24:19.08,you'll find a bag of puzzle pieces.
426,00:24:21.71,00:24:21.71,"Race back to your answer board, solve the puzzle."
427,00:24:24.92,00:24:24.92,That puzzle will give you your next set of coordinates leading
428,00:24:27.33,00:24:27.33,you to another bag of puzzle pieces and more coordinates.
429,00:24:30.92,00:24:30.92,Make sense? First person to complete all
430,00:24:33.88,00:24:33.88,"three puzzles wins immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final"
431,00:24:38.08,00:24:38.08,three. Your first set of coordinates
432,00:24:40.21,00:24:40.21,have already been set up for you.
433,00:24:41.92,00:24:41.92,We'll draw for positions and we'll get started.
434,00:24:45.38,00:24:45.38,"Here we go. For immunity, survivors ready?"
435,00:24:50.25,00:24:50.25,Go. First coordinates are already
436,00:24:53.83,00:24:53.83,done for you. Everybody's digging.
437,00:25:00.17,00:25:00.17,Aras found his first bag of puzzle pieces.
438,00:25:04.12,00:25:04.12,"Danielle, Cirie, Terry all have their pieces."

442,00:25:24.17,00:25:24.17,Terry and Danielle right behind. This puzzle will give you your
443,00:25:28.29,00:25:28.29,next set of coordinates. Terry getting in on his puzzle.

495,00:29:10.00,00:29:10.00,other than Terry is wearing individual immunity.
496,00:29:13.83,00:29:13.83,Aras is safe from the vote tonight.
497,00:29:16.17,00:29:16.17,"Terry, Danielle, Cirie, after 36 days, this game will come to"
498,00:29:20.75,00:29:20.75,an end for one of you at Tribal. It should make for a very fun
499,00:29:24.04,00:29:24.04,afternoon. Head on back to camp.
500,00:29:26.21,00:29:26.21,"See you at Tribal. >> Um, the comments you made"
501,00:29:47.58,00:29:47.58,"yesterday after the thing, um, were undefendable by me out in"
502,00:29:55.04,00:29:55.04,"front of everybody like that. They were false, uncalled for"
503,00:29:58.58,00:29:58.58,and really slanderous. What I need for from you is
504,00:30:01.50,00:30:01.50,"either an apology, and then we can talk about where you're"
505,00:30:04.12,00:30:04.12,"coming from and where I'm coming from, or we don't have a"
506,00:30:07.88,00:30:07.88,relationship for the next three days because that's how serious
507,00:30:10.08,00:30:10.08,stuff like that can be. I don't treat flight attendants
508,00:30:13.42,00:30:13.42,"like that, I haven't done anything that I wouldn't tell"
509,00:30:15.96,00:30:15.96,"my wife, my friends, my family, my priest."
510,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,>> Terry was really upset that I made a comment to him after
511,00:30:24.08,00:30:24.08,the reward challenge about him talking bad about women.
512,00:30:27.50,00:30:27.50,"Um, and you know what? I didn't feel good about making"
513,00:30:30.75,00:30:30.75,"the comment that I made. When I made that comment, I"
514,00:30:33.08,00:30:33.08,"knew it was going to get to you, but I apologize and I"
515,00:30:35.67,00:30:35.67,crossed a line that I don't want to cross.
516,00:30:37.50,00:30:37.50,>> Okay. >> I apologize a hundred
517,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,percent. You have not said a mean thing
518,00:30:41.33,00:30:41.33,about women. That was out of context and I
519,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,"should not have said that. As a human being, I treated you"
520,00:30:46.58,00:30:46.58,unfairly and I take full responsibility for that.
521,00:30:50.17,00:30:50.17,Going through this experience is something that really brings
522,00:30:53.38,00:30:53.38,"you closer together, regardless of how you feel about someone's"
523,00:30:57.12,00:30:57.12,"personality. And hopefully Terry and I,"
524,00:30:59.83,00:30:59.83,"through our conflict, we help each other grow."
525,00:31:02.38,00:31:02.38,I apologize for going personal like that on you.
526,00:31:05.38,00:31:05.38,">> All right, well, then, right here."
527,00:31:06.79,00:31:06.79,>> I'm sorry. Straight up.
528,00:31:07.83,00:31:07.83,I thought about that and I don't want to make this a personal
529,00:31:10.46,00:31:10.46,thing. >> I accept that. I accept that.
530,00:31:12.25,00:31:12.25,>> I don't want to make it... >> What the hell are they
531,00:31:17.00,00:31:17.00,talking about? >> Why they hate each other.
532,00:31:21.00,00:31:21.00,">> The outcome of the immunity challenge today-- Aras won, and"
533,00:31:23.83,00:31:23.83,"now, uh, Tribal Council is going to go a little bit differently"
534,00:31:27.21,00:31:27.21,than we planned. Do you guys know what you're
535,00:31:29.12,00:31:29.12,"voting? Aras has the immunity necklace,"
536,00:31:34.08,00:31:34.08,"and Terry has the hidden immunity idol, and my guess is"
537,00:31:38.38,00:31:38.38,"that Aras and Cirie are probably going to vote me, and then me"
538,00:31:43.96,00:31:43.96,and Terry would vote Cirie. So it looks like me and you are
539,00:31:47.00,00:31:47.00,going for... up against something tonight.
540,00:31:52.79,00:31:52.79,">> Probably fire. That's what it usually is,"
541,00:31:55.38,00:31:55.38,"making fire. >> So, we're assuming there will"
542,00:31:58.62,00:31:58.62,probably have to be a tiebreaker.
543,00:32:01.08,00:32:01.08,"We'll probably have to do some sort of fire challenge, um,"
544,00:32:03.17,00:32:03.17,"we're, we're guessing. I'm telling you right now,"
545,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,they're gonna... It's going to be a two-two for
546,00:32:12.88,00:32:12.88,"me and Cirie. >> Well, I was just wondering if"
547,00:32:15.08,00:32:15.08,"you needed to... you know, learn how to... know how to deal with"
548,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,the magnesium. That's what they're going to ask
549,00:32:19.04,00:32:19.04,"you for. >> With the flint, you mean?"
550,00:32:20.96,00:32:20.96,"Yeah, the back of the flint. >> You know the technique,"
551,00:32:23.21,00:32:23.21,right? (Aras vocalizing whooshing)
552,00:32:24.62,00:32:24.62,">> Yeah, I know how to do it. >> Blow on it, like... and then"
553,00:32:26.38,00:32:26.38,sticks... small sticks. >> I got that part.
554,00:32:28.29,00:32:28.29,">> Small sticks first, then put more husk."
555,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,>> Just take the flint. (Terry vocalizing whooshing)
556,00:32:33.83,00:32:33.83,">> Yeah. >> Take that back side, and you"
557,00:32:35.83,00:32:35.83,go... (Terry vocalizing whooshing)
558,00:32:37.67,00:32:37.67,...and you get as many... Try to get a pile about the size
559,00:32:40.46,00:32:40.46,"of a quarter next to your teepee, all right, so the tinder"
560,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,will catch. >> ...with sticks.
561,00:32:47.25,00:32:47.25,">> So as soon as I get a flame, should I blow it or no?"
562,00:32:49.08,00:32:49.08,">> Hell, yeah. >> Or let it catch first?"
563,00:32:50.96,00:32:50.96,">> Yeah, let it catch and then..."
564,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,(blowing) ...and then keep building.
565,00:32:54.00,00:32:54.00,"Just keep putting sticks up. Hey, and have fun when you do"
566,00:32:55.79,00:32:55.79,"it, too. Don't worry about the results."
567,00:32:57.42,00:32:57.42,You made it so far already. Just enjoy yourself and know
568,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,that you can do it. >> I have to.
569,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,"I don't want to go home. I have, like, mixed emotions"
570,00:33:07.29,00:33:07.29,"about Tribal tonight. I feel nervous, and I feel like"
571,00:33:10.12,00:33:10.12,"I'll prob... You know, it's a really strong"
572,00:33:12.25,00:33:12.25,"possibility that I'm going to go home, but at the same time,"
573,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,I think I'll do fine in the fire-making challenge.
574,00:33:18.29,00:33:18.29,I've only seen Danielle make fire with flint herself one
575,00:33:22.71,00:33:22.71,"time, and I think I'm just as good as she is at it."
576,00:33:25.38,00:33:25.38,I want her to think she has the upper hand.
577,00:33:36.21,00:33:36.21,">> I'm pretty confident that I'm good at starting fires, and I"
578,00:33:40.12,00:33:40.12,"haven't seen Cirie do that at all, so I don't think the fire"
579,00:33:42.67,00:33:42.67,"is her thing, but then again, I mean, I'm confident, but you"
580,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,"never know, so you have to be prepared."
581,00:33:48.08,00:33:48.08,You always have to have backup options.
582,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,">> Right. Right. >> Then there's a tie, and we"
583,00:33:58.08,00:33:58.08,"go. >> If you had the idol on you,"
584,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,then Cirie would automatically be out...
585,00:34:03.12,00:34:03.12,>> Be out. >> ...and then you and me
586,00:34:06.21,00:34:06.21,and-and Aras would go. >> This hidden immunity idol--
587,00:34:09.17,00:34:09.17,"tonight's the last night it can be used, so I'm going to work"
588,00:34:11.75,00:34:11.75,"Terry. If you gave it to me, they voted"
589,00:34:14.25,00:34:14.25,"for me, and it was two for me and two for Cirie, and I pulled"
590,00:34:17.54,00:34:17.54,"out the idol, I'd be fine? >> Yeah. Yeah, you'd be fine."
591,00:34:20.12,00:34:20.12,>> I'm going to work him until we go to Tribal Council to-to
592,00:34:22.96,00:34:22.96,"try to give me that hidden immunity idol, and, uh, we'll"
593,00:34:25.71,00:34:25.71,see what happens. >> PROBST: I'll now bring in the
594,00:34:45.17,00:34:45.17,"members of our jury. Austin, Sally, Bruce, Courtney"
595,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,and Shane voted out at the last Tribal Council.
596,00:34:58.00,00:34:58.00,"Well, when we started this game, we started with four groups--"
597,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,"older men, older women, younger men, younger women."
598,00:35:04.12,00:35:04.12,You got to be proud going to the final four with one person
599,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,"representing each group. So, Aras, you and Terry have"
600,00:35:12.04,00:35:12.04,"been battling at challenges. Suddenly, Terry loses"
601,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,"back-to-back, you win back-to-back."
602,00:35:17.58,00:35:17.58,"Has there been a momentum shift? >> Yeah, I think there's been a"
603,00:35:20.75,00:35:20.75,momentum shift. This is the way that I look at
604,00:35:23.00,00:35:23.00,it. I know every single time you
605,00:35:25.21,00:35:25.21,"say, ""Survivors ready,"" I have a chance to win, so I always had"
606,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,"faith that if I kept knocking on the door, eventually, it would"
607,00:35:31.38,00:35:31.38,"open up. >> PROBST: Terry, this is the"
608,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,first time you've been in Tribal Council without that necklace.
609,00:35:37.46,00:35:37.46,"You are, in a sense, vulnerable. Do you feel it?"
610,00:35:40.12,00:35:40.12,>> No. >> PROBST: You don't feel
611,00:35:42.33,00:35:42.33,vulnerable? >> Right.
612,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,">> PROBST: Cirie, seem odd to you that Terry is not the least"
613,00:35:48.50,00:35:48.50,bit concerned? >> No.
614,00:35:51.08,00:35:51.08,We've suspected for the longest time that Terry could possibly
615,00:35:54.17,00:35:54.17,"have the hidden immunity idol, and that would be the only"
616,00:35:56.54,00:35:56.54,"reason that Terry should feel safe tonight, so I guess we were"
617,00:35:59.96,00:35:59.96,right. >> PROBST: Let's talk about this
618,00:36:03.25,00:36:03.25,hidden immunity idol. I told you that it was good
619,00:36:05.96,00:36:05.96,through the final four vote. We are at the final four vote.
620,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,It has not come into play yet. Tonight is the last night.
621,00:36:11.88,00:36:11.88,"Did that topic come up at all? >> Obviously, that topic came"
622,00:36:15.29,00:36:15.29,"up, but it's up to the person that has it, and we don't know"
623,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,if they a hundred percent have it.
624,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,">> PROBST: The ""they"" is Terry? >> We're assuming Terry has it."
625,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,"Obviously, if he uses it, he'll use it on himself."
626,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,">> In my opinion, I'm 100% sure that Terry had that hidden"
627,00:36:29.79,00:36:29.79,"immunity idol. Now, whether or not it's still"
628,00:36:32.08,00:36:32.08,in his pocket or it's in somebody else's pocket-- that we
629,00:36:34.38,00:36:34.38,"don't know, but it's a risky call if you have that hidden"
630,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,immunity idol and give it to somebody else and put yourself
631,00:36:39.42,00:36:39.42,"on that chopping block, so we'll see what happens."
632,00:36:42.00,00:36:42.00,">> PROBST: So either way, Terry, it seems like good news for you"
633,00:36:44.46,00:36:44.46,"at this point, because people aren't sure if you have it or"
634,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,not. >> I'm not sure if I have it or
635,00:36:48.88,00:36:48.88,"not. >> PROBST: Well, here's what we"
636,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,know. If there's a hidden immunity
637,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"idol, it will come into play after the vote."
638,00:36:55.46,00:36:55.46,"So, going into the vote, the only person you can't vote for"
639,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"is Aras. Cirie, if this is your last"
640,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,night-- you've been out here 36 nights-- how have you changed?
641,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,>> I have lived my life underestimating myself.
642,00:37:11.21,00:37:11.21,"I've been on a couch for 35 years, basically."
643,00:37:15.25,00:37:15.25,"And to see the things that I've done and how long I lasted here,"
644,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,"if this is my last night, I had a great time, I've experienced"
645,00:37:21.67,00:37:21.67,"things I could never experience, once in a lifetime, and I'm"
646,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,"okay. >> PROBST: Danielle, how about"
647,00:37:29.58,00:37:29.58,"for you? Have you changed out here, 36"
648,00:37:32.08,00:37:32.08,days in? >> I just think that I've grown
649,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,to be more patient with different personalities.
650,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,"I mean, I don't think I've done this crazy change, but I've..."
651,00:37:42.04,00:37:42.04,"I think I've mentally grown stronger, and just like Cirie, I"
652,00:37:46.42,00:37:46.42,"was not an outdoorsy type of girl, and I can scale a fish"
653,00:37:50.92,00:37:50.92,"now, I'm great with fire now. It's just come natural now to"
654,00:37:53.75,00:37:53.75,"me. Like, if you want to do"
655,00:37:55.42,00:37:55.42,"something, get up and do it and make it happen, 'cause it's..."
656,00:37:57.92,00:37:57.92,It can happen. It's easy.
657,00:38:00.92,00:38:00.92,">> PROBST: Terry, since nobody seems to know for sure whether"
658,00:38:04.08,00:38:04.08,"you have the idol or not, it could be you tonight."
659,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,">> Uh, if it is, I've proved to myself that I-I could still hang"
660,00:38:10.96,00:38:10.96,"it out there with the... with the best of the competition, and"
661,00:38:14.08,00:38:14.08,"the other thing I've realized that I'm human, and I'm going to"
662,00:38:16.83,00:38:16.83,"make mistakes. But damn it, I'm going to learn"
663,00:38:18.62,00:38:18.62,"from them, and I'm going to be more patient with my kids, my"
664,00:38:21.21,00:38:21.21,"wife and-and friends and family, and, uh, I'm going to take that"
665,00:38:25.25,00:38:25.25,"to heart and take it back home with me, try to practice that."
666,00:38:29.29,00:38:29.29,>> PROBST: Okay. Let's get to the vote.
667,00:38:31.75,00:38:31.75,"Aras, you have immunity. Keeping it?"
668,00:38:34.71,00:38:34.71,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Aras is the only
669,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,"person you cannot vote for, hidden immunity idol or not."
670,00:38:40.21,00:38:40.21,Everybody else is fair game. It is time to vote.
671,00:38:42.58,00:38:42.58,"Danielle, you're up. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
672,00:39:13.50,00:39:13.50,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
673,00:39:21.88,00:39:21.88,decision is final. The person voted out will be
674,00:39:23.79,00:39:23.79,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
675,00:39:25.88,00:39:25.88,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Danielle."
676,00:39:37.08,00:39:37.08,"Cirie. One vote Danielle, one vote"
677,00:39:39.12,00:39:39.12,Cirie. Danielle.
678,00:39:46.21,00:39:46.21,"Two votes Danielle, one vote Cirie."
679,00:39:49.92,00:39:49.92,One vote left. Cirie.
680,00:40:00.17,00:40:00.17,"We have a tie. Cirie with two votes, Danielle"
681,00:40:02.12,00:40:02.12,"with two votes. Danielle, Cirie, if either of"
682,00:40:07.04,00:40:07.04,"you have the hidden immunity idol, now is the time to play"
683,00:40:10.17,00:40:10.17,it. Neither of you have it?
684,00:40:17.38,00:40:17.38,The idol will not come into play in this game.
685,00:40:19.75,00:40:19.75,"It no longer has any power, and we have a tie."
686,00:40:23.25,00:40:23.25,"Aras, Terry, you are safe. Danielle, Cirie, you're going"
687,00:40:26.62,00:40:26.62,to take part in a tiebreaker challenge.
688,00:40:29.96,00:40:29.96,Here's how it will work. It is a fire-making challenge.
689,00:40:33.29,00:40:33.29,You've been out here 37 days. Making fire should be something
690,00:40:36.96,00:40:36.96,you know how to do. You will have a fire-starter kit
691,00:40:40.29,00:40:40.29,and a small fire pit. Your job is to a build fire tall
692,00:40:44.17,00:40:44.17,"enough to burn through a rope, raise the flag."
693,00:40:47.29,00:40:47.29,"First person to raise their flag stays in this game, moves"
694,00:40:50.62,00:40:50.62,onto day 37. Loser is out of the game and
695,00:40:54.21,00:40:54.21,becomes the sixth member of our jury.
696,00:40:56.21,00:40:56.21,"All right, Danielle, take a spot."
697,00:40:59.08,00:40:59.08,"Cirie, spot next to her. You each have in your kit a"
698,00:41:09.96,00:41:09.96,"magnesium flint, you have a knife, and you have all sorts"
699,00:41:13.17,00:41:13.17,"of kindling and other ways to start a fire-- coconut husks,"
700,00:41:16.08,00:41:16.08,things like that. (Cirie exhales)
701,00:41:19.42,00:41:19.42,"On my go, you will begin. Here we go."
702,00:41:29.54,00:41:29.54,Survivors ready? (Cirie exhales loudly)
