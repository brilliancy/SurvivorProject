537,00:31:43.96,00:31:43.96,and Terry would vote Cirie.So it looks like me and you are
538,00:31:47.00,00:31:47.00,going for... up againstsomething tonight.
539,00:31:52.79,00:31:52.79,">> Probably fire.That's what it usually is,"

541,00:31:58.62,00:31:58.62,probably have to be atiebreaker.
542,00:32:01.08,00:32:01.08,"We'll probably have to do somesort of fire challenge, um,"
543,00:32:03.17,00:32:03.17,"we're, we're guessing.I'm telling you right now,"
544,00:32:11.25,00:32:11.25,they're gonna...It's going to be a two-two for
545,00:32:12.88,00:32:12.88,"me and Cirie.>> Well, I was just wondering if"

547,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,the magnesium.That's what they're going to ask
548,00:32:19.04,00:32:19.04,"you for.>> With the flint, you mean?"
549,00:32:20.96,00:32:20.96,"Yeah, the back of the flint.>> You know the technique,"

558,00:32:40.46,00:32:40.46,"of a quarter next to yourteepee, all right, so the tinder"
559,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,will catch.>> ...with sticks.

565,00:32:55.79,00:32:55.79,"it, too.Don't worry about the results."
566,00:32:57.42,00:32:57.42,You made it so far already.Just enjoy yourself and know
567,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,that you can do it.>> I have to.
568,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,"I don't want to go home.I have, like, mixed emotions"
569,00:33:07.29,00:33:07.29,"about Tribal tonight.I feel nervous, and I feel like"
570,00:33:10.12,00:33:10.12,"I'll prob...You know, it's a really strong"
571,00:33:12.25,00:33:12.25,"possibility that I'm going togo home, but at the same time,"
572,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,I think I'll do fine in thefire-making challenge.
573,00:33:18.29,00:33:18.29,I've only seen Danielle makefire with flint herself one
574,00:33:22.71,00:33:22.71,"time, and I think I'm just asgood as she is at it."
575,00:33:25.38,00:33:25.38,I want her to think she has theupper hand.
576,00:33:36.21,00:33:36.21,">> I'm pretty confident that I'mgood at starting fires, and I"
577,00:33:40.12,00:33:40.12,"haven't seen Cirie do that atall, so I don't think the fire"
578,00:33:42.67,00:33:42.67,"is her thing, but then again, Imean, I'm confident, but you"
579,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,"never know, so you have to beprepared."
580,00:33:48.08,00:33:48.08,You always have to have backupoptions.
581,00:33:53.92,00:33:53.92,">> Right. Right.>> Then there's a tie, and we"
582,00:33:58.08,00:33:58.08,"go.>> If you had the idol on you,"
583,00:34:00.83,00:34:00.83,then Cirie would automaticallybe out...
584,00:34:03.12,00:34:03.12,>> Be out.>> ...and then you and me
585,00:34:06.21,00:34:06.21,and-and Aras would go.>> This hidden immunity idol--
586,00:34:09.17,00:34:09.17,"tonight's the last night it canbe used, so I'm going to work"
587,00:34:11.75,00:34:11.75,"Terry.If you gave it to me, they voted"
588,00:34:14.25,00:34:14.25,"for me, and it was two for meand two for Cirie, and I pulled"
589,00:34:17.54,00:34:17.54,"out the idol, I'd be fine?>> Yeah. Yeah, you'd be fine."
590,00:34:20.12,00:34:20.12,>> I'm going to work him untilwe go to Tribal Council to-to
591,00:34:22.96,00:34:22.96,"try to give me that hiddenimmunity idol, and, uh, we'll"
592,00:34:25.71,00:34:25.71,see what happens.>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the
593,00:34:45.17,00:34:45.17,"members of our jury.Austin, Sally, Bruce, Courtney"
594,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,and Shane voted out at the lastTribal Council.
595,00:34:58.00,00:34:58.00,"Well, when we started this game,we started with four groups--"
596,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,"older men, older women, youngermen, younger women."
597,00:35:04.12,00:35:04.12,You got to be proud going to thefinal four with one person
598,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,"representing each group.So, Aras, you and Terry have"
599,00:35:12.04,00:35:12.04,"been battling at challenges.Suddenly, Terry loses"
600,00:35:15.08,00:35:15.08,"back-to-back, you winback-to-back."
601,00:35:17.58,00:35:17.58,"Has there been a momentum shift?>> Yeah, I think there's been a"
602,00:35:20.75,00:35:20.75,momentum shift.This is the way that I look at
603,00:35:23.00,00:35:23.00,it.I know every single time you
604,00:35:25.21,00:35:25.21,"say, ""Survivors ready,"" I have achance to win, so I always had"
605,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,"faith that if I kept knocking onthe door, eventually, it would"
606,00:35:31.38,00:35:31.38,"open up.>> PROBST: Terry, this is the"
607,00:35:33.83,00:35:33.83,first time you've been in TribalCouncil without that necklace.
608,00:35:37.46,00:35:37.46,"You are, in a sense, vulnerable.Do you feel it?"
609,00:35:40.12,00:35:40.12,>> No.>> PROBST: You don't feel
610,00:35:42.33,00:35:42.33,vulnerable?>> Right.
611,00:35:45.08,00:35:45.08,">> PROBST: Cirie, seem odd toyou that Terry is not the least"
612,00:35:48.50,00:35:48.50,bit concerned?>> No.
613,00:35:51.08,00:35:51.08,We've suspected for the longesttime that Terry could possibly
614,00:35:54.17,00:35:54.17,"have the hidden immunity idol,and that would be the only"
615,00:35:56.54,00:35:56.54,"reason that Terry should feelsafe tonight, so I guess we were"
616,00:35:59.96,00:35:59.96,right.>> PROBST: Let's talk about this
617,00:36:03.25,00:36:03.25,hidden immunity idol.I told you that it was good
618,00:36:05.96,00:36:05.96,through the final four vote.We are at the final four vote.
619,00:36:09.21,00:36:09.21,It has not come into play yet.Tonight is the last night.
620,00:36:11.88,00:36:11.88,"Did that topic come up at all?>> Obviously, that topic came"
621,00:36:15.29,00:36:15.29,"up, but it's up to the personthat has it, and we don't know"
622,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,if they a hundred percent haveit.
623,00:36:21.25,00:36:21.25,">> PROBST: The ""they"" is Terry?>> We're assuming Terry has it."
624,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,"Obviously, if he uses it, he'lluse it on himself."
625,00:36:27.00,00:36:27.00,">> In my opinion, I'm 100% surethat Terry had that hidden"
626,00:36:29.79,00:36:29.79,"immunity idol.Now, whether or not it's still"
627,00:36:32.08,00:36:32.08,in his pocket or it's insomebody else's pocket-- that we
628,00:36:34.38,00:36:34.38,"don't know, but it's a riskycall if you have that hidden"
629,00:36:37.08,00:36:37.08,immunity idol and give it tosomebody else and put yourself
630,00:36:39.42,00:36:39.42,"on that chopping block, so we'llsee what happens."
631,00:36:42.00,00:36:42.00,">> PROBST: So either way, Terry,it seems like good news for you"
632,00:36:44.46,00:36:44.46,"at this point, because peoplearen't sure if you have it or"
633,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,not.>> I'm not sure if I have it or
634,00:36:48.88,00:36:48.88,"not.>> PROBST: Well, here's what we"
635,00:36:51.25,00:36:51.25,know.If there's a hidden immunity
636,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"idol, it will come into playafter the vote."
637,00:36:55.46,00:36:55.46,"So, going into the vote, theonly person you can't vote for"
638,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"is Aras.Cirie, if this is your last"
639,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,night-- you've been out here 36nights-- how have you changed?
640,00:37:05.25,00:37:05.25,>> I have lived my lifeunderestimating myself.

642,00:37:15.25,00:37:15.25,"And to see the things that I'vedone and how long I lasted here,"
643,00:37:19.04,00:37:19.04,"if this is my last night, I hada great time, I've experienced"
644,00:37:21.67,00:37:21.67,"things I could never experience,once in a lifetime, and I'm"
645,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,"okay.>> PROBST: Danielle, how about"
646,00:37:29.58,00:37:29.58,"for you?Have you changed out here, 36"

648,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,to be more patient withdifferent personalities.
649,00:37:38.17,00:37:38.17,"I mean, I don't think I've donethis crazy change, but I've..."
650,00:37:42.04,00:37:42.04,"I think I've mentally grownstronger, and just like Cirie, I"
651,00:37:46.42,00:37:46.42,"was not an outdoorsy type ofgirl, and I can scale a fish"

655,00:37:57.92,00:37:57.92,It can happen.It's easy.
656,00:38:00.92,00:38:00.92,">> PROBST: Terry, since nobodyseems to know for sure whether"
657,00:38:04.08,00:38:04.08,"you have the idol or not, itcould be you tonight."
658,00:38:07.25,00:38:07.25,">> Uh, if it is, I've proved tomyself that I-I could still hang"
