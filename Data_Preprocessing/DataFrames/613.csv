2,00:00:01.27,00:00:01.27,"JEFF PROBST:  Previously, on Survivor..."
3,00:00:02.67,00:00:02.67, Heidi and Jenna  felt betrayed by Rob.
4,00:00:04.43,00:00:04.43,It's time to evaluate what you're willing
5,00:00:07.60,00:00:07.60,to do to win this game.
6,00:00:08.83,00:00:08.83,"I know, but I'm not willing"
7,00:00:10.07,00:00:10.07,to turn my back on people that I love.
8,00:00:11.97,00:00:11.97,Rob screwed the alliance. We hate him.
9,00:00:14.70,00:00:14.70,PROBST: So the girls  tried to recruit Christy.
10,00:00:16.47,00:00:16.47,"When we're gone, they said you're next."
11,00:00:18.03,00:00:18.03,"HEIDI: If I can get Christy to go in with Jenna and myself,"
12,00:00:21.23,00:00:21.23,then we stand a 50% chance of staying.
13,00:00:23.37,00:00:23.37,PROBST: Matthew won  the reward challenge...
14,00:00:25.43,00:00:25.43,Matthew wins reward!
15,00:00:26.83,00:00:26.83, ...and gave the tribe  a visit with their loved ones.
16,00:00:29.20,00:00:29.20,I love you.
17,00:00:31.13,00:00:31.13," Back at camp, Rob proposed  a new plan to Jenna."
18,00:00:33.67,00:00:33.67,The person that I could stand the best chance
19,00:00:35.43,00:00:35.43,at the end of the game with is you.
20,00:00:37.43,00:00:37.43, But it was more than  she could stand.
21,00:00:38.90,00:00:38.90,Have you told everybody else that you wanted to take me
22,00:00:40.77,00:00:40.77,to the end because I'm the only one you can beat?
23,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60,Did you ever think that I was lying to you?
24,00:00:44.57,00:00:44.57,You'll win the game if you continue to screw everybody.
25,00:00:47.23,00:00:47.23," At the immunity challenge,  it was Jenna who won."
26,00:00:49.97,00:00:49.97,Jenna wins immunity.
27,00:00:52.77,00:00:52.77, Rob was nervous  about Christy's allegiance.
28,00:00:54.60,00:00:54.60,You're still gonna vote for Heidi tonight?
29,00:00:56.23,00:00:56.23,I guess so.
30,00:00:57.23,00:00:57.23,I don't know.
31,00:00:58.73,00:00:58.73,ROB: The threat of Christy  defecting terrifies me.
32,00:01:00.63,00:01:00.63,CHRISTY: I'm trying to figure out what do I need to do
33,00:01:02.80,00:01:02.80, to get to that  one million dollars.
34,00:01:04.50,00:01:04.50," I weigh both groups,"
35,00:01:06.53,00:01:06.53,"and I'm, like, I don't know what to do."
36,00:01:08.67,00:01:08.67,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,  it was Christy's indecision"
37,00:01:11.07,00:01:11.07, which led to her demise.
38,00:01:13.37,00:01:13.37,The tribe has spoken.
39,00:01:16.73,00:01:16.73, Five are left.
40,00:01:19.07,00:01:19.07, Who will be voted out tonight?
41,00:02:35.80,00:02:35.80,JENNA: I feel like I have the flu.
42,00:02:38.07,00:02:38.07,"When I-- my tonsils get bad,"
43,00:02:39.53,00:02:39.53,"like, I-I get what's called pharyngitis."
44,00:02:41.97,00:02:41.97,-Right. -Which is not only
45,00:02:43.23,00:02:43.23,"like tonsillitis, but it's an infection"
46,00:02:45.50,00:02:45.50,of my pharynx and larynx.
47,00:02:47.33,00:02:47.33,"-Wow. -And it gets, like, really bad."
48,00:02:49.33,00:02:49.33,And it's miserable.
49,00:02:51.10,00:02:51.10,"JENNA: The hardest thing  about the end of this game,"
50,00:02:53.23,00:02:53.23," you're so tired of  playing this game, and then"
51,00:02:55.37,00:02:55.37," you have to live with people  who you can't trust,"
52,00:02:57.40,00:02:57.40,and that really does wear on you mentally.
53,00:02:59.07,00:02:59.07,You'd be expecting more people to be here.
54,00:03:01.43,00:03:01.43,-I know. -This is really it.
55,00:03:02.70,00:03:02.70,There's Team Crazy and us three.
56,00:03:04.47,00:03:04.47,-Mm-hmm. -(chuckles)
57,00:03:05.87,00:03:05.87,"Things change now, like, because of what happened last night."
58,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,"Like, I don't feel, like, half as betrayed as I did before."
59,00:03:13.43,00:03:13.43,"If it wasn't for you, one of us wouldn't be here, so..."
60,00:03:15.70,00:03:15.70,"ROB: Amazingly, I really don't  sense any animosity"
61,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00," from the two girls, that they really are making it clear"
62,00:03:20.77,00:03:20.77, that I saved their ass  last night and they're very--
63,00:03:23.07,00:03:23.07, they seem to be very grateful.
64,00:03:24.83,00:03:24.83,"At this point in time, you know, I understand that"
65,00:03:27.40,00:03:27.40,"you need to think about, you know, who you screw over"
66,00:03:29.47,00:03:29.47,is going to be on the jury.
67,00:03:30.80,00:03:30.80,And now it's at the point where
68,00:03:32.13,00:03:32.13,I'm completely honest with them.
69,00:03:33.40,00:03:33.40,"Basically, this is what I'm thinking:"
70,00:03:34.77,00:03:34.77,"Um, Heidi, I think I'm gonna,"
71,00:03:35.87,00:03:35.87,I'm gonna vote-vote for you next.
72,00:03:38.03,00:03:38.03,Okay.
73,00:03:39.13,00:03:39.13,"And then, and then Jenna, but you know"
74,00:03:41.63,00:03:41.63,-Okay. -that-that we're-we're so close
75,00:03:43.00,00:03:43.00,"to the end, that immunities could screw any--"
76,00:03:44.53,00:03:44.53,could screw anything up.
77,00:03:45.97,00:03:45.97,I think it's a smooth move because once they think--
78,00:03:48.37,00:03:48.37,even though Butch is a moron...
79,00:03:49.70,00:03:49.70,Mm-hmm.
80,00:03:50.97,00:03:50.97,"...you, you know, against him is a lock."
81,00:03:53.50,00:03:53.50,I did think about-about if I was to flip-flop here
82,00:03:56.87,00:03:56.87,"and then go-go with you two to the end,"
83,00:04:00.17,00:04:00.17,but then I would just screw over every single person
84,00:04:02.97,00:04:02.97,that I've ever come in contact with in the game
85,00:04:04.70,00:04:04.70,and I would just look like the biggest ... ever.
86,00:04:07.33,00:04:07.33,Mm-hmm.
87,00:04:08.83,00:04:08.83,"And, uh..."
88,00:04:09.90,00:04:09.90,And you care about that at this point?
89,00:04:11.90,00:04:11.90,-(laughs) -The jury...
90,00:04:13.03,00:04:13.03,ROB:  Telling the girls my plans
91,00:04:14.40,00:04:14.40, to vote off  Heidi and then Jenna
92,00:04:15.93,00:04:15.93, was actually  very well received.
93,00:04:17.17,00:04:17.17, It seems like
94,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,people don't get too mad when you tell them that.
95,00:04:20.13,00:04:20.13,"They're just like, ""Oh, okay, cool."""
96,00:04:22.20,00:04:22.20,"And, uh, I don't think they have anything up their sleeves."
97,00:04:24.97,00:04:24.97,"That's what I'm saying: we're sitting here thanking Rob,"
98,00:04:27.03,00:04:27.03,"you know what I mean, but really it was us that got us here."
99,00:04:30.07,00:04:30.07,"Yeah, I know."
100,00:04:31.13,00:04:31.13,"I mean, I can't express that to him."
101,00:04:32.77,00:04:32.77,We've got three days.
102,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,All I know is I'm going out fighting.
103,00:04:59.27,00:04:59.27,You got a lot.
104,00:05:01.40,00:05:01.40,"Let me tell you girls right now, I got firewood,"
105,00:05:04.67,00:05:04.67,gonna keep the fire burning for three days.
106,00:05:08.20,00:05:08.20,This is the best firewood that you could find.
107,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,Why? We have eight pounds of firewood
108,00:05:12.73,00:05:12.73,and the biggest log I've ever seen in my life.
109,00:05:15.00,00:05:15.00,I don't know why.
110,00:05:16.00,00:05:16.00,Butch said that I have to get firewood.
111,00:05:18.13,00:05:18.13,(laughs)
112,00:05:19.13,00:05:19.13,Butch done lost his mind.
113,00:05:23.23,00:05:23.23,Yeah.
114,00:05:24.93,00:05:24.93,This good stuff?
115,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,Is it dry?
116,00:05:28.20,00:05:28.20,ROB:  I don't know what Butch's
117,00:05:29.63,00:05:29.63,obsession with firewood is.
118,00:05:31.70,00:05:31.70," When Butch wakes up  in the morning,"
119,00:05:34.20,00:05:34.20," the first thing he says is,"
120,00:05:35.90,00:05:35.90," ""We need to go get  some firewood."""
121,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,Good stuff.
122,00:05:38.77,00:05:38.77,Dry.
123,00:05:40.10,00:05:40.10," When he gets back from  getting firewood, he says,"
124,00:05:42.53,00:05:42.53," ""I think we need to get  some more wood."""
125,00:05:44.93,00:05:44.93,And he's adamant about the wood.
126,00:05:49.17,00:05:49.17,"Butch, what you doing?"
127,00:05:50.83,00:05:50.83,More firewood.
128,00:05:51.93,00:05:51.93,"Ooh, it's dry."
129,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57,"Butch, you love your firewood."
130,00:05:55.37,00:05:55.37,I love to work.
131,00:05:56.67,00:05:56.67,"If you're gonna be successful in life, Rob..."
132,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,-Yes? -...you can't sit back on your haunches
133,00:06:00.13,00:06:00.13,"and let somebody else do it for you, you know what I mean?"
134,00:06:02.53,00:06:02.53,"Gotta get out there, get the fire..."
135,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,Just get what you can handle. That's good.
136,00:06:07.13,00:06:07.13,"Don't-Don't try to do too much,"
137,00:06:08.37,00:06:08.37,'cause we got several trips we can make.
138,00:06:10.10,00:06:10.10,All right.
139,00:06:11.43,00:06:11.43,ROB: I don't know  how I necessarily became
140,00:06:13.43,00:06:13.43, the junior deputy  firewood bitch.
141,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,"I'm getting my good shirt dirty, Butch."
142,00:06:19.23,00:06:19.23,I don't want to be a team with Butch.
143,00:06:21.00,00:06:21.00,This is the good w--
144,00:06:23.03,00:06:23.03,"What's so great about this,"
145,00:06:24.77,00:06:24.77,as opposed to anything else that's in this forest?
146,00:06:28.00,00:06:28.00,JENNA: We have so much firewood;  it's everywhere.
147,00:06:30.07,00:06:30.07," It's under the shelter,  it's by the fire."
148,00:06:32.33,00:06:32.33," I mean, we have huge logs"
149,00:06:33.60,00:06:33.60, in our shelter  we're not using anymore.
150,00:06:35.03,00:06:35.03,I don't know what he does.
151,00:06:36.10,00:06:36.10,I don't know if he talks to the wood.
152,00:06:37.23,00:06:37.23,"Ooh, man, this is nice."
153,00:06:39.10,00:06:39.10,BUTCH:  Fire is very important.
154,00:06:40.50,00:06:40.50, That's the reason  why I keep wanting to get
155,00:06:42.23,00:06:42.23, some more wood and keep it  dry as we possibly can
156,00:06:45.50,00:06:45.50, to have it for an emergency.
157,00:06:47.07,00:06:47.07,"I'm just a wood-crazy nut, I guess."
158,00:06:48.50,00:06:48.50,"The sun's coming out, baby."
159,00:06:50.53,00:06:50.53,"I want to tell you, it's coming out-- it's about 1:00."
160,00:06:52.57,00:06:52.57,"About three hours of dry time, that's gonna be dry,"
161,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23,the wood we're gonna take out there.
162,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,"Gonna put that over there,"
163,00:06:58.13,00:06:58.13,we're gonna be ready to rock and roll.
164,00:07:01.00,00:07:01.00,(grunts)
165,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,And why are we gonna be able to rock and roll?
166,00:07:04.47,00:07:04.47,'Cause I'm gonna dance tonight.
167,00:07:07.47,00:07:07.47,My wife says I embarrass her when I dance.
168,00:07:09.47,00:07:09.47,I don't know why.
169,00:07:10.67,00:07:10.67,(laughing)
170,00:07:16.47,00:07:16.47,(laughing)
171,00:07:25.43,00:07:25.43,(Rob trumpets a fanfare)
172,00:07:27.87,00:07:27.87,Want to wait till...
173,00:07:29.07,00:07:29.07,HEIDI: I don't care.
174,00:07:30.20,00:07:30.20,-...we get back there? -Sure.
175,00:07:33.80,00:07:33.80,Okay.
176,00:07:35.37,00:07:35.37,"-You guys ready? -Yep, ready."
177,00:07:38.90,00:07:38.90,"""To succeed in the future, you must learn from the past,"
178,00:07:41.87,00:07:41.87,"Your coolest reward is also the last."""
179,00:07:43.80,00:07:43.80,Wow.
180,00:07:45.20,00:07:45.20,"BUTCH: This being  the last reward, uh, all of us"
181,00:07:49.33,00:07:49.33,are anticipating it being a big juicy reward.
182,00:07:52.40,00:07:52.40,"If it starts to rain, we'll put this under there."
183,00:07:54.97,00:07:54.97,Thank you.
184,00:07:56.27,00:07:56.27,"Butch, how do you think we are on firewood if it rains?"
185,00:07:58.27,00:07:58.27,"Uh, just got to put this stuff here over there."
186,00:08:00.60,00:08:00.60,-Okay. -I think we're in pretty good shape.
187,00:08:02.73,00:08:02.73,ROB: You think we need to get any more
188,00:08:04.17,00:08:04.17,-or you think we're okay? -I think we're okay.
189,00:08:05.77,00:08:05.77,Just put those two underneath the thing.
190,00:08:12.87,00:08:12.87,"Hey, let's-let's do it."
191,00:08:14.73,00:08:14.73,All right.
192,00:08:16.10,00:08:16.10,Everyone here ready to roll?
193,00:08:17.63,00:08:17.63,Let's go.
194,00:08:18.63,00:08:18.63,"All right, guys."
195,00:08:20.63,00:08:20.63,"Good luck, everyone."
196,00:08:22.17,00:08:22.17,Good luck.
197,00:08:43.87,00:08:43.87,"PROBST: Come on in, guys."
198,00:08:46.37,00:08:46.37,"How you guys doing, 34 days in now?"
199,00:08:49.80,00:08:49.80,I'm fine.
200,00:08:51.17,00:08:51.17,"How you doing, Jenna?"
201,00:08:52.33,00:08:52.33,"Just, tonsils are getting big."
202,00:08:53.47,00:08:53.47,Maybe getting a little case of tonsillitis.
203,00:08:54.93,00:08:54.93,That's definitely not working
204,00:08:56.20,00:08:56.20,"towards my advantage, but I'm a little girl."
205,00:08:58.93,00:08:58.93,I can only ask so much from a small body.
206,00:09:01.27,00:09:01.27,"All right, for today's reward challenge,"
207,00:09:03.10,00:09:03.10,"you'll get a chance to revisit a few challenges from the past,"
208,00:09:07.10,00:09:07.10,as well as get a sneak peek at a challenge from the future.
209,00:09:09.97,00:09:09.97,-Whoa. -Wow.
210,00:09:11.90,00:09:11.90,"Here's how it works. For the first stage,"
211,00:09:13.13,00:09:13.13,"you'll have to make your way out of a cage,"
212,00:09:14.83,00:09:14.83, escaping by untying  a series of knots.
213,00:09:18.00,00:09:18.00, That'll lead you to a puzzle.
214,00:09:19.57,00:09:19.57," Flip over the pieces,  solve the puzzle."
215,00:09:21.97,00:09:21.97,You will then head to a rope swing.
216,00:09:23.80,00:09:23.80," This is something  you haven't done,"
217,00:09:25.43,00:09:25.43,but you will in the future.
218,00:09:26.90,00:09:26.90, Untie the rope and use it  to swing across the gully.
219,00:09:29.97,00:09:29.97,This will drop you off at a decoding station.
220,00:09:32.67,00:09:32.67," Decode the message,  it will lead you to a key."
221,00:09:35.73,00:09:35.73, Climb the ladder and use the  key to unlock the flying fox.
222,00:09:40.00,00:09:40.00, First person  to cross the finish line
223,00:09:42.40,00:09:42.40, and grab the last key
224,00:09:44.27,00:09:44.27,wins reward.
225,00:09:45.37,00:09:45.37,Want to know what you're playing for?
226,00:09:47.50,00:09:47.50,"It goes along with the key, and it's right there."
227,00:09:50.23,00:09:50.23,"-Wow. -Oh, God. -Oh, my God."
228,00:09:52.43,00:09:52.43,Saturn Ion.
229,00:09:53.70,00:09:53.70,"We always save the best rewards till later in the game,"
230,00:09:55.77,00:09:55.77,because you guys have been out here the longest.
231,00:09:57.80,00:09:57.80,-Pretty sweet. -There's something else
232,00:09:58.90,00:09:58.90,comes with the reward.
233,00:10:00.03,00:10:00.03,The winner gets to have a little tailgate party.
234,00:10:02.67,00:10:02.67,You got a hibachi in there.
235,00:10:04.40,00:10:04.40,"You'll have hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken."
236,00:10:05.80,00:10:05.80,Everything you need.
237,00:10:07.20,00:10:07.20,"Take your spots, wait for my go."
238,00:10:10.63,00:10:10.63,Here we go.
239,00:10:11.90,00:10:11.90,At stake: Saturn Ion and a tailgate party with food.
240,00:10:14.90,00:10:14.90,Survivors ready?
241,00:10:16.43,00:10:16.43,Go!

250,00:10:36.20,00:10:36.20,"Heidi putting all that bicep into it, grunting and groaning."
251,00:10:39.30,00:10:39.30,Jenna not thinking about her tonsils at all.
252,00:10:41.57,00:10:41.57,Heidi having trouble.
253,00:10:44.30,00:10:44.30,Matthew down to his last two knots.
254,00:10:46.07,00:10:46.07,Butch making good progress.

263,00:11:07.77,00:11:07.77,"Matthew out the door, trailing right behind Butch."
264,00:11:15.47,00:11:15.47,Rob's out the door.
265,00:11:17.20,00:11:17.20,Rob right on your tail.
266,00:11:19.20,00:11:19.20,"Butch working on his puzzle, Matthew working on his."
267,00:11:22.33,00:11:22.33,The three men are in it.
268,00:11:23.63,00:11:23.63,"Let's go, Heidi and Jenna!"
269,00:11:25.37,00:11:25.37,Don't give up!
270,00:11:28.47,00:11:28.47,Jenna out the door.
271,00:11:32.53,00:11:32.53,Jeff?
272,00:11:35.73,00:11:35.73,Rob's done. You're moving on.
273,00:11:53.90,00:11:53.90,"Matthew's done, moving on."

275,00:12:10.67,00:12:10.67,"Don't quit, guys!"
276,00:12:13.80,00:12:13.80,They're stuck on the message.
277,00:12:22.23,00:12:22.23,How about this one?
278,00:12:25.53,00:12:25.53,Butch is done.
279,00:12:27.00,00:12:27.00,You're moving on.

288,00:13:13.63,00:13:13.63,Matthew wins reward!
289,00:13:16.00,00:13:16.00,(whooping)
290,00:13:17.20,00:13:17.20,"That's your car, baby."
291,00:13:18.30,00:13:18.30,-Head on over. -(whooping)
292,00:13:21.00,00:13:21.00,This thing better be gassed up!
293,00:13:26.27,00:13:26.27,(engine starts)
294,00:13:28.07,00:13:28.07,(horn honking)
295,00:13:31.13,00:13:31.13,"Get in here, Rob!"
296,00:13:32.40,00:13:32.40,"Get in here, dude!"
297,00:13:33.50,00:13:33.50,Get in here. We got the AC on.
298,00:13:34.87,00:13:34.87,Come on in.
299,00:13:35.87,00:13:35.87,"Get in here, dude."
300,00:13:37.30,00:13:37.30,Get in! We have air conditioning for the first time in 34 days.
301,00:13:40.97,00:13:40.97,"Nice job, Matthew."
302,00:13:42.13,00:13:42.13,You figured out the message quickly.
303,00:13:43.73,00:13:43.73,You got a tailgate party.
304,00:13:44.93,00:13:44.93,"Yeah. Can I share it with everyone, please?"
305,00:13:46.80,00:13:46.80,But it's not happening.
306,00:13:47.87,00:13:47.87,"As always, you have to make a choice."
307,00:13:49.63,00:13:49.63,"At this stage in the game, who you choose"
308,00:13:51.33,00:13:51.33,"could work for you, could work against you, but you gotta pick"
309,00:13:54.30,00:13:54.30,"somebody to share hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken."
310,00:13:57.37,00:13:57.37,"You guys, I made a deal before this game; I told Rob."
311,00:14:00.33,00:14:00.33,I was hoping it was gonna be more people than that.
312,00:14:04.03,00:14:04.03,"Everybody else, out of the car."
313,00:14:05.60,00:14:05.60,I'm sorry.
314,00:14:07.13,00:14:07.13,"As nice as it would be to have everybody here,"
315,00:14:09.23,00:14:09.23,"Jenna, Butch and Heidi, you guys got to head back to camp."
316,00:14:28.33,00:14:28.33,I'm so happy to have this car.
317,00:14:30.03,00:14:30.03,This-- I can't describe how cool this car is.
318,00:14:32.73,00:14:32.73,"When-When you go away, can I borrow it?"
319,00:14:34.30,00:14:34.30,"You can borrow this car, dude, you can take it for a spin."
320,00:14:36.80,00:14:36.80,Can I tell girls that it's mine?
321,00:14:38.50,00:14:38.50,"Dude, you can cruise chicks in this car-- I will let you."
322,00:14:40.30,00:14:40.30,"Well, how far back do the seats go?"
323,00:14:41.60,00:14:41.60,"Dude, I don't know. Check it out."
324,00:14:42.70,00:14:42.70,"-Well, it's got a big back seat. -Wow."
325,00:14:44.97,00:14:44.97,I really am very happy for Matthew.
326,00:14:46.77,00:14:46.77,I'm very happy that he got to win the car.
327,00:14:49.10,00:14:49.10," And I asked him  that if he ever goes to Asia,"
328,00:14:52.27,00:14:52.27," or if he ever returns to  the planet that he came from,"
329,00:14:56.30,00:14:56.30, that he said I can borrow it and go out cruising for chicks.
330,00:15:00.10,00:15:00.10,Let's see what we got.
331,00:15:01.80,00:15:01.80,Grapes.
332,00:15:02.80,00:15:02.80,Wow. Grapes?
333,00:15:03.80,00:15:03.80,-Awesome. -(chuckles)
334,00:15:05.43,00:15:05.43,-Hot dogs. Cool. -Wow.
335,00:15:07.23,00:15:07.23,"Marinated chicken? Oh, yeah, put all the meat over here, dude."
336,00:15:09.33,00:15:09.33,Let's be organized.
337,00:15:10.90,00:15:10.90,"Oh, look at these hamburgers!"
338,00:15:12.03,00:15:12.03,"Oh, my God!"
339,00:15:13.10,00:15:13.10,"Oh, and potato salad, dude."
340,00:15:14.33,00:15:14.33,They're like Flintstone hamburgers.
341,00:15:15.80,00:15:15.80,(laughs)
342,00:15:17.07,00:15:17.07,How do you light this hibachi?
343,00:15:18.43,00:15:18.43,I would imagine that...
344,00:15:19.47,00:15:19.47,"Too bad, too bad Butch isn't here."
345,00:15:22.57,00:15:22.57,"Yeah, he's going to be bummed."
346,00:15:24.43,00:15:24.43,"No, I'm talking about that we're,"
347,00:15:25.63,00:15:25.63,"-that we're lighting a fire. -Oh, yeah."
348,00:15:27.17,00:15:27.17,"Oh, we got all this firewood around here, we could just..."
349,00:15:29.57,00:15:29.57,Yeah.
350,00:15:31.43,00:15:31.43,"Here, let me do this."
351,00:15:32.80,00:15:32.80,This is your forte.
352,00:15:33.90,00:15:33.90,It is.
353,00:15:34.90,00:15:34.90,I'm a pyromaniac.
354,00:15:36.43,00:15:36.43,I noticed.
355,00:15:37.87,00:15:37.87,Butch is going to be so jealous we have coal.
356,00:16:10.87,00:16:10.87,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
357,00:16:37.57,00:16:37.57,"Good job, Matteo."
358,00:16:38.77,00:16:38.77,"Hey, you know, I just got the magic touch."
359,00:16:41.03,00:16:41.03,What can I say?
360,00:16:42.23,00:16:42.23,"Wow, I wish I had one of these back at camp."
361,00:16:45.43,00:16:45.43,No kidding.
362,00:16:46.50,00:16:46.50,Think we'll get to keep this thing?
363,00:16:47.90,00:16:47.90,"You know, I'm a little bit bummed that I took the..."
364,00:16:49.50,00:16:49.50,The manioc?
365,00:16:50.50,00:16:50.50,"How many hot dogs, dude?"
366,00:16:51.50,00:16:51.50,"Uh, make a bunch,"
367,00:16:53.40,00:16:53.40,because we can't take them back.
368,00:16:56.63,00:16:56.63,I want my hot dog...
369,00:16:58.07,00:16:58.07,"Uh, yeah, I want mine, um, dark."
370,00:17:32.83,00:17:32.83,"Oh, look at the size of that."
371,00:17:34.37,00:17:34.37,(laughs)
372,00:17:35.37,00:17:35.37,"-Oh, marrone.  -Marrone."
373,00:17:37.13,00:17:37.13,You got it.
374,00:17:38.57,00:17:38.57,How long do you think the chicken's going to take to cook?
375,00:17:40.67,00:17:40.67,Chicken won't take too long.
376,00:17:41.73,00:17:41.73,I think we can put some on the side.
377,00:17:43.30,00:17:43.30,-Why don't we do that? -There's a lot there.
378,00:17:44.73,00:17:44.73,Wow. Smells great.
379,00:17:46.43,00:17:46.43,I feel like George Foreman right now.
380,00:18:26.30,00:18:26.30,(birds chirping)
381,00:18:52.77,00:18:52.77,"Oh, ..."
382,00:18:54.33,00:18:54.33,"HEIDI: Oh, my God."
383,00:18:57.07,00:18:57.07,BUTCH: Oh.
384,00:19:01.00,00:19:01.00,"JENNA: Oh, my gosh."
385,00:19:02.67,00:19:02.67,"Looks like we had a little fire, folks."
386,00:19:06.10,00:19:06.10,What in hell happened?
387,00:19:08.67,00:19:08.67,All my stuff.
388,00:19:09.67,00:19:09.67,All of our stuff.
389,00:19:11.17,00:19:11.17,"Like, important stuff."
390,00:19:13.50,00:19:13.50,None of our bags are left.
391,00:19:14.77,00:19:14.77,"Everything's gone, guys."
392,00:19:18.40,00:19:18.40,The wood we had in there must've caught on fire
393,00:19:20.63,00:19:20.63,and down she came.
394,00:19:22.60,00:19:22.60,My jacket.
395,00:19:24.27,00:19:24.27,Everything we have is gone.
396,00:19:26.50,00:19:26.50,"Oh, my God."
397,00:19:27.83,00:19:27.83,"My food, everything."
398,00:19:29.20,00:19:29.20,My letters.
399,00:19:31.30,00:19:31.30,At least you still have yours.
400,00:19:34.07,00:19:34.07,Okay.
401,00:19:35.97,00:19:35.97,All my clothes are gone.
402,00:19:37.47,00:19:37.47,Everything?
403,00:19:39.07,00:19:39.07,JENNA: I don't really know  what happened 'cause I--
404,00:19:41.03,00:19:41.03,"we always leave a fire and it's  never burned anything down,"
405,00:19:43.43,00:19:43.43," so, I guess it just  got out of control"
406,00:19:45.37,00:19:45.37, and burned all the extra wood.
407,00:19:46.87,00:19:46.87,Everything's burned down.
408,00:19:48.10,00:19:48.10,The fire shelter's burnt down.
409,00:19:49.43,00:19:49.43,"The extra shelter and our packs were all burned,"
410,00:19:51.27,00:19:51.27,except Heidi's underneath.
411,00:19:52.70,00:19:52.70,I'm so sorry.
412,00:19:54.63,00:19:54.63,Are you okay?
413,00:19:55.63,00:19:55.63,What can I do?
414,00:19:56.93,00:19:56.93," I had stuff in my pack  that can't be replaced,"
415,00:19:59.20,00:19:59.20, like my pledge crown.
416,00:20:00.57,00:20:00.57, My Zeta jacket  can't be replaced
417,00:20:02.43,00:20:02.43, because it's-it's passed down  from sister to sister.
418,00:20:05.07,00:20:05.07, So I can never get that back.
419,00:20:12.43,00:20:12.43,Don't you feel totally lucky?
420,00:20:14.57,00:20:14.57,All that stuff you saved.
421,00:20:17.93,00:20:17.93,"No, it kills me... to know how much everybody lost."
422,00:20:21.53,00:20:21.53,HEIDI:  I totally felt guilt
423,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03, about being the only person  that had a pack remaining.
424,00:20:27.07,00:20:27.07," I mean, most people  would be like, ""Whoo-hoo!"""
425,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47," you know,  ""My stuff's still here!"""
426,00:20:29.83,00:20:29.83," I was like, ""I wish my stuff  would have been burnt,"
427,00:20:32.30,00:20:32.30," just like everybody else's."""
428,00:20:33.97,00:20:33.97,"That way, I could just, you know,"
429,00:20:35.63,00:20:35.63,be on the same level with them.
430,00:20:37.17,00:20:37.17,"So what-what do we need to do, Butch?"
431,00:20:39.13,00:20:39.13,Just get the logs off?
432,00:20:40.77,00:20:40.77,"Uh, I think we probably--"
433,00:20:42.30,00:20:42.30,first thing we want to do is want to get this down.
434,00:20:45.17,00:20:45.17,We're gonna have to use this stuff.
435,00:20:46.60,00:20:46.60,"BUTCH: The first thing  that came to my mind was,"
436,00:20:48.57,00:20:48.57," ""God, could it be my fault?""  you know."
437,00:20:50.13,00:20:50.13, We'll never know. But was it disappointing? Yeah.
438,00:20:52.30,00:20:52.30," I lost my sign,"
439,00:20:53.87,00:20:53.87,"uh, ""Believe In Yourself,"" so now we're really gonna have to"
440,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,believe in ourselves to make it through the next five days.
441,00:20:59.60,00:20:59.60,I'm just... blown away.
442,00:21:04.20,00:21:04.20,Unbelievable.
443,00:21:08.20,00:21:08.20,"MATTHEW:  Make the toast, dude."
444,00:21:09.47,00:21:09.47,-To two. -To two.
445,00:21:11.87,00:21:11.87,"It's gonna be us, dude."
446,00:21:14.87,00:21:14.87,"What do you want, a burger or hot dog first?"
447,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,Hot dog.
448,00:21:17.87,00:21:17.87,I love hot dogs so much.
449,00:21:19.80,00:21:19.80,"Bon app\xc3\xa9tit, dude."
450,00:21:21.37,00:21:21.37,MATTHEW: It's just such  a great thing to see two
451,00:21:24.63,00:21:24.63,really different people
452,00:21:25.77,00:21:25.77,with different strategies come together.
453,00:21:27.60,00:21:27.60,"I mean, I learned the game through Rob,"
454,00:21:29.70,00:21:29.70,"and, uh, he learned survival skills, you know,"
455,00:21:32.30,00:21:32.30,"through watching me, and he helped me a lot initially,"
456,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,and I'm helping him a lot now.
457,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83,I've run out of credit.
458,00:21:38.10,00:21:38.10,My trust... nobody trusts me anymore.
459,00:21:40.03,00:21:40.03,-Right. Except for me. -Yep.
460,00:21:42.30,00:21:42.30,And I do because you're the reason I'm here today.
461,00:21:46.63,00:21:46.63,"So many times, you came through"
462,00:21:48.07,00:21:48.07,and gave me just enough information.
463,00:21:50.73,00:21:50.73,"-It's just like, you wouldn't be here without me... -Yep."
464,00:21:53.47,00:21:53.47,...I wouldn't be able to finish this out without you.
465,00:21:55.60,00:21:55.60,Yep. Right.
466,00:21:56.73,00:21:56.73,ROB:  I've taken us to this point.
467,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83, There's no more moves  I can make.
468,00:22:01.20,00:22:01.20,I've done all I can do to get us to this point.
469,00:22:03.73,00:22:03.73," Matt is the player that's in  the driver's seat, not me."
470,00:22:06.73,00:22:06.73, I'm shotgun right at  this point in the game.
471,00:22:09.43,00:22:09.43,-Not one other person in this game... -Yep.
472,00:22:11.17,00:22:11.17,"would... would, uh... would-would..."
473,00:22:12.97,00:22:12.97,-would trust me to go to the end. -Right.
474,00:22:15.10,00:22:15.10,"And, for that, I owe you everything."
475,00:22:17.13,00:22:17.13,Right. Yep.
476,00:22:18.53,00:22:18.53,MATTHEW: I'm so stoked  that I've crafted
477,00:22:21.60,00:22:21.60, very strong relationships  with both Rob
478,00:22:25.93,00:22:25.93,"and Butch, and as far as they know,"
479,00:22:28.40,00:22:28.40,I'm going to the final two with each of them.
480,00:22:30.83,00:22:30.83,"Dude, I gotta say good-bye to my car. Dude, I-I'm so..."
481,00:22:32.77,00:22:32.77,"Where are you going to put it, long-term parking?"
482,00:22:34.33,00:22:34.33,I guess so.
483,00:22:35.90,00:22:35.90,MATTHEW: I feel like I've got  two options now locked in.
484,00:22:38.87,00:22:38.87," Now, if I have to choose  later on,"
485,00:22:41.43,00:22:41.43," it's going to be difficult,"
486,00:22:42.97,00:22:42.97," and one of them is going to be  stabbed in the back,"
487,00:22:45.77,00:22:45.77,and that will be the first time in the game
488,00:22:47.37,00:22:47.37,that I've had to do that to get ahead.
489,00:22:53.90,00:22:53.90,Once I get some coals started here...
490,00:22:56.53,00:22:56.53,I dug a little hole in the ground.
491,00:22:58.27,00:22:58.27,"-I see that. -So once I get some coals started,"
492,00:23:00.43,00:23:00.43,all we gotta do is just maintain
493,00:23:02.13,00:23:02.13,"-one or two logs on that fire, okay? -Right."
494,00:23:04.10,00:23:04.10,We got nothing.
495,00:23:06.30,00:23:06.30,Can't believe it.
496,00:23:08.53,00:23:08.53,Whose fault?
497,00:23:10.87,00:23:10.87,"It's all of ours, I guess."
498,00:23:12.27,00:23:12.27,Shouldn't have had the wood in there. I don't know.
499,00:23:13.83,00:23:13.83,Maybe we had too big a fire.
500,00:23:15.03,00:23:15.03,JENNA: I don't know.
501,00:23:17.23,00:23:17.23,"Damned if you do, you're damned if you don't."
502,00:23:18.87,00:23:18.87,"Yeah, you're right."
503,00:23:20.43,00:23:20.43,All right.
504,00:23:22.93,00:23:22.93,I... I am eternally grateful once again.
505,00:23:27.43,00:23:27.43,Dude.
506,00:23:30.47,00:23:30.47,MATTHEW: My pleasure.
507,00:23:32.23,00:23:32.23,You've earned it.
508,00:23:34.13,00:23:34.13,What's happening with the fire over there?
509,00:23:38.00,00:23:38.00,We had a little problem.
510,00:23:39.80,00:23:39.80,The shelter burned down.
511,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,-The shelter burned down? -Yeah.
512,00:23:42.97,00:23:42.97,-And all of our packs... -All the packs.
513,00:23:44.17,00:23:44.17,...except Heidi's were burnt.
514,00:23:45.20,00:23:45.20,-(gasps) -Holy... -They're all...
515,00:23:47.03,00:23:47.03,Everything we have is gone.
516,00:23:48.40,00:23:48.40,"Clothes, everything."
517,00:23:50.70,00:23:50.70,Dude.
518,00:23:51.97,00:23:51.97,We had to rebuild while you guys were gone.
519,00:23:55.47,00:23:55.47,Unbelievable.
520,00:23:57.77,00:23:57.77,Catastrophe.
521,00:23:59.83,00:23:59.83,ROB: Everything I had to help me  with survival is gone.
522,00:24:05.40,00:24:05.40,That's a blow.
523,00:24:07.33,00:24:07.33,"That really is a blow, and..."
524,00:24:10.30,00:24:10.30,"outside of somebody getting hurt,"
525,00:24:12.73,00:24:12.73,that's the worst thing that could happen to one of us.
526,00:24:16.50,00:24:16.50,"You guys, this sucks."
527,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,I know.
528,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,"I had stuff that's been passed down for, like,"
529,00:24:22.00,00:24:22.00,"five years, six years that I can never get back."
530,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,"Dude, I don't have anything warm to wear at night."
531,00:24:27.57,00:24:27.57,I know.
532,00:24:29.93,00:24:29.93,"MATTHEW:  I believe in fate,"
533,00:24:31.67,00:24:31.67, and this was probably  unavoidable.
534,00:24:34.13,00:24:34.13, I could see how it happened.
535,00:24:35.93,00:24:35.93, There was a... an awful lot  of wood stacked there.
536,00:24:38.13,00:24:38.13, And I'm not going to point  any fingers
537,00:24:40.90,00:24:40.90,"because we don't do that in this tribe,"
538,00:24:43.50,00:24:43.50,"um, but in hindsight, it was basically,"
539,00:24:47.00,00:24:47.00,"you know, an inferno waiting to happen."
540,00:24:49.80,00:24:49.80,"It got hot, and then it ignited, and then, once it ignited,"
541,00:24:53.53,00:24:53.53,"then, uh, the wood right by it-- why wouldn't it burn, too?"
542,00:24:56.40,00:24:56.40,The wood... I don't think the wood...
543,00:24:58.70,00:24:58.70,Do you think the wood right next to it...?
544,00:25:00.23,00:25:00.23,"See, it was a small fire we left."
545,00:25:02.23,00:25:02.23,JENNA: It all caught. All of it.
546,00:25:03.67,00:25:03.67,It all caught.
547,00:25:04.87,00:25:04.87,Doesn't make any difference how it happened.
548,00:25:06.07,00:25:06.07,It caught and burned.
549,00:25:07.20,00:25:07.20,Hm.
550,00:25:08.80,00:25:08.80,"ROB: I'm not one  for conspiracy theories,"
551,00:25:12.67,00:25:12.67, but I do know this:
552,00:25:14.47,00:25:14.47," with about 137 days  worth of dry wood,"
553,00:25:19.47,00:25:19.47, our camp burnt to the ground.
554,00:25:22.10,00:25:22.10, Was there a connection?  I don't know.
555,00:25:24.53,00:25:24.53,I'm not one to point fingers.
556,00:25:26.00,00:25:26.00,(coughing): Butch.
557,00:25:28.30,00:25:28.30,"Dude, this is unbelievable."
558,00:25:37.93,00:25:37.93,(thunder rumbling)
559,00:25:48.80,00:25:48.80,"So everyone knows, there's a rumbling in the distance."
560,00:25:51.63,00:25:51.63,ROB: I know. That's why I'm jumping out of bed now.
561,00:25:55.13,00:25:55.13,"I'm, um, getting the vines ready for the fire shelter."
562,00:26:00.33,00:26:00.33,"MATTHEW: Plan of attack  is not to sleep this morning,"
563,00:26:02.93,00:26:02.93," but to build  another fire shelter,"
564,00:26:04.53,00:26:04.53," and what we'll do differently  this time is,"
565,00:26:07.33,00:26:07.33,"we won't be stacking any wood around the fire any longer,"
566,00:26:11.47,00:26:11.47, unless there's someone here  to watch over it very closely.
567,00:26:26.60,00:26:26.60,HEIDI: Butch is the person  I want voted off.
568,00:26:29.13,00:26:29.13, I want Butch to go  before me and Jenna.
569,00:26:31.43,00:26:31.43," I mean,  I feel like we've earned it,"
570,00:26:33.13,00:26:33.13,"we've worked our butts off, we've not been careless,"
571,00:26:35.47,00:26:35.47,we didn't burn down the camp.
572,00:26:37.03,00:26:37.03," But, uh, the three guys"
573,00:26:38.83,00:26:38.83," that we're up against  right now, there's no way."
574,00:26:41.03,00:26:41.03, They are hardcore alliance.
575,00:26:43.67,00:26:43.67, There's no way to break that.
576,00:26:47.83,00:26:47.83," This morning,  I watched the three boys"
577,00:26:50.80,00:26:50.80," try to rebuild the fire  as much as they could,"
578,00:26:53.10,00:26:53.10, gathering all these  beautiful palm fronds
579,00:26:55.43,00:26:55.43, and new sticks  and all this stuff.
580,00:26:57.43,00:26:57.43," I said to Jenna,  ""You know, I feel bad"
581,00:26:59.37,00:26:59.37," for not helping them,""  and then I go,"
582,00:27:01.30,00:27:01.30,"""Nah, I really don't."""
583,00:27:04.77,00:27:04.77,(whispering)
584,00:27:06.50,00:27:06.50,(Jenna chuckles)
585,00:27:07.97,00:27:07.97,JENNA: We're not doing  any work for them.
586,00:27:09.80,00:27:09.80,"Why? You're going to vote us off,"
587,00:27:11.17,00:27:11.17,we're not doing crap for you.
588,00:27:12.53,00:27:12.53,We're making your life easier.
589,00:27:18.57,00:27:18.57, I'm definitely grateful  they built a shelter
590,00:27:20.70,00:27:20.70," 'cause we need it 'cause it rains, and we really needed it,"
591,00:27:22.87,00:27:22.87, but I'm just not...  I won't help.
592,00:27:27.87,00:27:27.87,"MATTHEW: If I were Heidi,  if I were Jenna,"
593,00:27:31.83,00:27:31.83," I would work real hard,  help out at camp,"
594,00:27:34.70,00:27:34.70, try to convince people that I  shouldn't be the first to go.
595,00:27:37.73,00:27:37.73, They're just digging  a deeper grave
596,00:27:39.57,00:27:39.57,"for themselves, as far as I'm concerned."
597,00:27:56.57,00:27:56.57,"Come on in, guys."
598,00:28:01.70,00:28:01.70,What happened to the immunity necklace?
599,00:28:04.73,00:28:04.73,(laughs) The right side got a little scorched.
600,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,-Thrashed. -What happened?
601,00:28:09.23,00:28:09.23,-A fire. -A fire issue.
602,00:28:10.63,00:28:10.63,"BUTCH: We rebuilt a new fire, uh, hut"
603,00:28:13.03,00:28:13.03,"and a new, um, place to sleep."
604,00:28:14.43,00:28:14.43,"We lost a lot of stuff that we need,"
605,00:28:15.87,00:28:15.87,"but it's gut-check time, so we turned it up a notch."
606,00:28:19.13,00:28:19.13,-Let's go. -PROBST: Okay.
607,00:28:21.30,00:28:21.30,We're getting down to it.
608,00:28:22.93,00:28:22.93,"For today's immunity challenge,"
609,00:28:24.57,00:28:24.57,you must navigate your way through our ropes course.
610,00:28:27.13,00:28:27.13,There are five individual rope obstacles.
611,00:28:30.90,00:28:30.90,"In no particular order,"
612,00:28:32.17,00:28:32.17,"you'll make your way along the disc walk,"
613,00:28:34.77,00:28:34.77,"you'll maneuver through the rope tunnel,"
614,00:28:37.33,00:28:37.33,you'll use the rope swing
615,00:28:38.73,00:28:38.73,"to swing from one side to the other,"
616,00:28:40.63,00:28:40.63,"you'll use the swing steps,"
617,00:28:42.83,00:28:42.83,and you'll make your way through the V tunnel.
618,00:28:44.77,00:28:44.77,"At the end of each obstacle, you will retrieve"
619,00:28:46.77,00:28:46.77,"a colored feather, bring it back to the center post."
620,00:28:50.13,00:28:50.13,The first person to complete all five obstacles
621,00:28:53.53,00:28:53.53,and get all five colored feathers at the center post
622,00:28:56.97,00:28:56.97,wins immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final four
623,00:29:00.77,00:29:00.77,and a one-in-four shot at being the sole survivor.
624,00:29:03.77,00:29:03.77,I need that necklace back.
625,00:29:05.93,00:29:05.93,"A little worse for wear, but nonetheless,"
626,00:29:08.60,00:29:08.60,immunity back up for grabs. Let's go.
627,00:29:12.97,00:29:12.97,For immunity-- survivors ready.
628,00:29:15.47,00:29:15.47,Go!
629,00:29:18.23,00:29:18.23,Rob taking the disc walk.
630,00:29:20.37,00:29:20.37,Matthew starting through the tunnel first.
631,00:29:21.97,00:29:21.97,Heidi working her way through the V bridge.
632,00:29:23.87,00:29:23.87,"-Jenna's taking the swing step. -Oh, sh...!"
633,00:29:25.83,00:29:25.83,Butch going for the rope swing.
634,00:29:27.40,00:29:27.40,"(grunt) Ah, sh...!"
635,00:29:47.57,00:29:47.57,Butch is...
636,00:29:50.07,00:29:50.07,"over to the other side, just barely,"
637,00:29:52.57,00:29:52.57,using the tree for help.
638,00:29:53.77,00:29:53.77,Tie that rope up.
639,00:29:55.63,00:29:55.63,Don't slow down.
640,00:29:57.70,00:29:57.70,Heidi retrieving her first feather.
641,00:29:59.63,00:29:59.63,Rob getting his first feather.
642,00:30:01.83,00:30:01.83,Matthew on his way back.
643,00:30:03.57,00:30:03.57,"Let's go, Jenna. Keep moving!"
644,00:30:04.90,00:30:04.90,I'm trying.
645,00:30:06.23,00:30:06.23,Heidi on her way back with her first feather.
646,00:30:08.20,00:30:08.20,Rob on his way back with his first feather.
647,00:30:10.30,00:30:10.30,-Butch on his way back with his first feather. -Whoa...
648,00:30:12.83,00:30:12.83,Matthew has his first feather.
649,00:30:16.93,00:30:16.93,Butch has his first feather.
650,00:30:23.43,00:30:23.43,Butch working his way through the rope web.
651,00:30:25.40,00:30:25.40,Heidi has her first feather.
652,00:30:31.50,00:30:31.50,Rob has his first feather.
653,00:30:32.87,00:30:32.87,Rob heading for the V bridge.

655,00:30:40.77,00:30:40.77,Jenna heading back with her first feather.
656,00:30:43.73,00:30:43.73,Matthew's back with his second feather.
657,00:30:50.37,00:30:50.37,Matthew and Jenna both on the same obstacle.
658,00:30:53.47,00:30:53.47,"Jenna coming back, Matthew heading in."
659,00:30:56.30,00:30:56.30,(grunting)
660,00:31:04.30,00:31:04.30,Jenna has her first feather.
661,00:31:15.27,00:31:15.27,Heidi has another feather.
662,00:31:17.47,00:31:17.47,Rob right behind her with another feather.
663,00:31:19.63,00:31:19.63,Rob is at two feathers.
664,00:31:22.20,00:31:22.20,Matthew at two feathers.
665,00:31:23.90,00:31:23.90,-Heidi at two feathers. -(Butch muttering)
666,00:31:29.83,00:31:29.83,Matthew with his third feather.
667,00:31:34.10,00:31:34.10,Heidi on the rope swing.

670,00:31:45.87,00:31:45.87,Jenna with another feather.
671,00:31:47.33,00:31:47.33,Way to make time.
672,00:31:49.93,00:31:49.93,Rob navigating carefully along the rope swing.
673,00:31:53.70,00:31:53.70,Butch right behind him.
674,00:31:55.07,00:31:55.07,Matthew back with another feather.
675,00:31:57.00,00:31:57.00,Matthew has four feathers.
676,00:31:58.53,00:31:58.53,He only needs one more.
677,00:31:59.93,00:31:59.93,Matthew coming up on Jenna's back on the disc walk.
678,00:32:04.27,00:32:04.27,"Matthew going for his last feather,"
679,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,banging his knees across those.
680,00:32:09.60,00:32:09.60,Rob and Butch still working on the rope swing.
681,00:32:13.30,00:32:13.30,Heidi with another feather.
682,00:32:15.70,00:32:15.70,ROB: She has three.
683,00:32:17.00,00:32:17.00,Heidi at three feathers.
684,00:32:24.67,00:32:24.67,Matthew on his last feather.
685,00:32:26.03,00:32:26.03,"He's got it, and he's heading back,"
686,00:32:28.80,00:32:28.80,banging those knees once again.
687,00:32:38.70,00:32:38.70,Jenna right behind him.
688,00:32:40.97,00:32:40.97,Matthew with his last feather.
689,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,If he can get across...
690,00:32:44.53,00:32:44.53,He's here.
691,00:32:45.63,00:32:45.63,Hook it and you got it.
692,00:32:48.23,00:32:48.23,Matthew wins immunity.
693,00:32:51.50,00:32:51.50,Nice job.
694,00:32:56.97,00:32:56.97,"Half of it's burned off,"
695,00:32:58.73,00:32:58.73,but no less impactful or important.
696,00:33:00.40,00:33:00.40,You are safe from the vote.
697,00:33:02.30,00:33:02.30,One of the four of you-- going home.
698,00:33:04.93,00:33:04.93,You guys can head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal Council.
699,00:33:25.43,00:33:25.43,(chopping)
700,00:33:45.00,00:33:45.00,"Oh, I can't do this anymore."
701,00:33:47.20,00:33:47.20,HEIDI: What's the matter?
702,00:33:48.27,00:33:48.27,I can't do this anymore.
703,00:33:50.60,00:33:50.60,I feel like crap.
704,00:33:52.83,00:33:52.83,I hate every minute of being here.
705,00:33:55.97,00:33:55.97,There are so many things
706,00:33:57.67,00:33:57.67,"that are more important to me right now,"
707,00:33:59.40,00:33:59.40,and I just can't... I can't even walk.
708,00:34:01.30,00:34:01.30,"Like, every time I walk,"
709,00:34:03.03,00:34:03.03,"I take five steps, and I... I'm, like, about to collapse."
710,00:34:07.90,00:34:07.90,"I'm having, like, chest... chest pains,"
711,00:34:10.43,00:34:10.43,and everything just falls apart.
712,00:34:13.30,00:34:13.30,This is the last thing I wanted to do
713,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,"on the last couple days, is be a big baby."
714,00:34:18.57,00:34:18.57,"HEIDI: You're not, Jenna."
715,00:34:19.73,00:34:19.73,But I... there's nothing I can do.
716,00:34:21.60,00:34:21.60,I'm stuck... here.
717,00:34:23.90,00:34:23.90,Nothing's working. Nothing's getting better.
718,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83,HEIDI: Jenna's physical state  right now is not good.
719,00:34:29.73,00:34:29.73," I want to make sure  that every possibility,"
720,00:34:33.03,00:34:33.03,every chance of me staying in this game is here.
721,00:34:35.13,00:34:35.13,How am I supposed to enjoy my last couple days here
722,00:34:37.77,00:34:37.77,when I can't even do anything?
723,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,(sniffling)
724,00:34:42.13,00:34:42.13,(sighs) This is miserable.
725,00:34:43.73,00:34:43.73,ROB: Is there anything I can do?
726,00:34:45.63,00:34:45.63,"Nope, there's nothing."
727,00:34:46.97,00:34:46.97,It's nobody's fault.
728,00:34:48.10,00:34:48.10,"Like, there's nothing I can do."
729,00:34:49.40,00:34:49.40,I just hate feeling helpless.
730,00:34:51.17,00:34:51.17,"Just, seriously, take my coat and just lay down."
731,00:34:53.93,00:34:53.93,"I-I... just, like... I'm so uncomfortable, though."
732,00:34:55.90,00:34:55.90,-I know. -I can't...
733,00:34:57.03,00:34:57.03,I can't even close my eyes.
734,00:34:58.57,00:34:58.57,"HEIDI: Definitely,  having Jenna voted out"
735,00:34:59.80,00:34:59.80, before me works  to my advantage.
736,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40, Knowing that we have to get  ready to vote somebody off
737,00:35:03.80,00:35:03.80, makes me want  to campaign for her
738,00:35:05.97,00:35:05.97,to go off to the boys.
739,00:35:08.27,00:35:08.27,You don't understand how sick she is.
740,00:35:09.93,00:35:09.93,But it's only one day more.
741,00:35:11.73,00:35:11.73,"-It's not like... -Uh, exactly."
742,00:35:13.40,00:35:13.40,-It's only one day. -It's not like...
743,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,So I don't understand why it matters.
744,00:35:16.30,00:35:16.30,And she is... this is killing me.
745,00:35:20.50,00:35:20.50,"She is genuinely, genuinely concerned about her health."
746,00:35:24.67,00:35:24.67,"-I know. -And she feels like just that one extra day,"
747,00:35:27.07,00:35:27.07,she will not make it.
748,00:35:28.67,00:35:28.67,"What do you mean, she won't... she won't make it?"
749,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,"-I don't know. She just... -Like, she'll die?"
750,00:35:31.70,00:35:31.70,"No, but she feels like she just mentally can't handle it."
751,00:35:34.43,00:35:34.43,I don't know.
752,00:35:35.67,00:35:35.67,ROB: There are a couple  of different reasons
753,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03, why somebody would want  to vote for Jenna tonight.
754,00:35:40.60,00:35:40.60," She's whining, and she's sick."
755,00:35:43.40,00:35:43.40,(sighs) This is miserable.
756,00:35:45.63,00:35:45.63, And those are two things  that you should try to avoid
757,00:35:49.07,00:35:49.07," at these stages in the game,  because if you're willing"
758,00:35:53.03,00:35:53.03," to put your head  on the chopping block,"
759,00:35:54.90,00:35:54.90,I'm willing to lop it off.
760,00:36:22.73,00:36:22.73,Now bring in the members of our jury.
761,00:36:24.73,00:36:24.73,"Dave, Deena, Alex and Christy--"
762,00:36:29.43,00:36:29.43,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
763,00:36:34.57,00:36:34.57,So let's start talking about the last three days.
764,00:36:37.77,00:36:37.77,"Take me through it, Butch."
765,00:36:39.27,00:36:39.27,The big event-- you came back to camp
766,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43,after our reward challenge and discovered...?
767,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27,"We discovered a, um... there'd been a, uh, fire."
768,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,It was... I call it a total destruction fire.
769,00:36:49.90,00:36:49.90,"Our whole camp was destroyed by, um, fire--"
770,00:36:51.97,00:36:51.97,all of our belongings.
771,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"Um, what you see with..."
772,00:36:55.10,00:36:55.10,"with us now, basically, is what we have."
773,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,"Matthew, how do you suspect the fire started?"
774,00:37:00.53,00:37:00.53,"Um, there was lot of wood drying"
775,00:37:03.07,00:37:03.07,"behind, um, the fire that we left to burn."
776,00:37:06.83,00:37:06.83,So what I imagine happened is that the wood
777,00:37:09.77,00:37:09.77,"that we left burning ignited some of the dry wood behind it,"
778,00:37:13.60,00:37:13.60,"and then ignited the fire shelter itself,"
779,00:37:17.10,00:37:17.10,so it was basically total destruction.
780,00:37:19.57,00:37:19.57,"PROBST: Butch, I know, in the past, you've told me"
781,00:37:21.57,00:37:21.57,that collecting wood was your big deal.
782,00:37:23.43,00:37:23.43,And listening to what Matthew talked about
783,00:37:25.57,00:37:25.57,"with the fire and what might have happened,"
784,00:37:27.47,00:37:27.47,did you feel any initial responsibility that maybe
785,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,"""all of my ferocious wood collecting"
786,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,"actually might have helped spark this fire?"""
787,00:37:35.50,00:37:35.50,"Yes, at first, I did, but then, um,"
788,00:37:37.97,00:37:37.97,"there are so many variables that could've happened, uh..."
789,00:37:40.97,00:37:40.97,I feel comfortable that it wasn't... wasn't my fault.
790,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,"PROBST: Now, in addition to the fire,"
791,00:37:45.07,00:37:45.07,we have some rain coming down right now at Tribal Council.
792,00:37:48.03,00:37:48.03,"Jenna, it's been a tough last few days,"
793,00:37:50.43,00:37:50.43,"I know, for you, with not feeling well."
794,00:37:52.77,00:37:52.77,"Then you come back to camp, you have a fire."
795,00:37:54.60,00:37:54.60,Then Mother Nature downpours.
796,00:37:55.93,00:37:55.93,How you doing?
797,00:37:57.20,00:37:57.20,"Uh, I don't know what's going on."
798,00:37:59.63,00:37:59.63,"I got some sort of tonsillitis in the jungle,"
799,00:38:03.33,00:38:03.33,and it's impossible for me to recover
800,00:38:05.73,00:38:05.73,because I just... there's just...
801,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,"we're not eating enough stuff, so..."
802,00:38:09.90,00:38:09.90,"-it's been hard. -PROBST: Well, at this point in the game,"
803,00:38:12.37,00:38:12.37,I'm sure everybody's thinking
804,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,about making it to the final two.
805,00:38:15.53,00:38:15.53,"Jenna, what is your basis for who you would want to take"
806,00:38:20.50,00:38:20.50,"to the final two, if it were up to you?"
807,00:38:22.57,00:38:22.57,"If-if anybody... everybody who knows me knows,"
808,00:38:24.77,00:38:24.77,"at this point, it would be loyalty."
809,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,I-I... I would rather go up
810,00:38:29.00,00:38:29.00,against somebody who I really care about
811,00:38:30.67,00:38:30.67,and I know was a great player and that be it.
812,00:38:34.10,00:38:34.10,"Like, I wouldn't want to go up"
813,00:38:35.80,00:38:35.80,"against somebody I knew I could beat,"
814,00:38:37.13,00:38:37.13,because it's not competition.
815,00:38:39.37,00:38:39.37,"Heidi, do you think you deserve to be in the final two?"
816,00:38:41.63,00:38:41.63,I definitely deserve to be in the final two.
817,00:38:43.60,00:38:43.60,These other four people know how I've played this game.
818,00:38:46.33,00:38:46.33,I've played so hard.
819,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,"I'm, like, the mastermind"
820,00:38:49.70,00:38:49.70,behind half of the plans that go on day-to-day.
821,00:38:53.80,00:38:53.80,"And, I mean, I've got three guys here"
822,00:38:57.13,00:38:57.13,that are scared to death of me right now--
823,00:38:59.07,00:38:59.07,that I can beat them.
824,00:39:01.07,00:39:01.07,And that is saying something. That's saying something--
825,00:39:03.07,00:39:03.07,that I have not just been a slacker in this game.
826,00:39:05.30,00:39:05.30,"Matthew, what are you basing your vote on tonight?"
827,00:39:08.40,00:39:08.40,Allegiance to my alliance
828,00:39:09.77,00:39:09.77,which has gotten me this far in the game.
829,00:39:12.20,00:39:12.20,Think you my have to turn on that allegiance at some point?
830,00:39:14.97,00:39:14.97,"If and when we get down to final three,"
831,00:39:18.10,00:39:18.10,it'll be every man for himself.
832,00:39:20.93,00:39:20.93,PROBST: Is that part of the deal you've made?
833,00:39:22.80,00:39:22.80,Yes.
834,00:39:24.13,00:39:24.13,PROBST: Okay.
835,00:39:25.87,00:39:25.87,"It is wet, but we have to vote anyway."
836,00:39:28.03,00:39:28.03,"Before we do, Matthew, you have immunity."
837,00:39:29.57,00:39:29.57,Any chance of you giving that up?
838,00:39:31.43,00:39:31.43,Okay. It is time to vote.
839,00:39:35.13,00:39:35.13,"Matthew, you're up."
840,00:40:27.13,00:40:27.13,"Two girls, one brain--"
841,00:40:29.67,00:40:29.67, divide by two:
842,00:40:31.13,00:40:31.13, Only one half-wit left.
843,00:40:44.23,00:40:44.23,I'll go tally the votes.
844,00:41:01.90,00:41:01.90,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
845,00:41:04.00,00:41:04.00,Person voted out will be asked to leave
846,00:41:05.80,00:41:05.80,the Tribal Council area immediately.
847,00:41:07.33,00:41:07.33,I'll read the votes.
848,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,First vote.

852,00:41:27.67,00:41:27.67,Rob.
853,00:41:29.00,00:41:29.00,"Two votes Rob, one vote Heidi."
854,00:41:33.80,00:41:33.80,Heidi.
855,00:41:34.93,00:41:34.93,"Two votes Heidi, two votes Rob."

866,00:42:20.53,00:42:20.53,"Somewhere along the way, hopefully, a break in the rain."
867,00:42:24.00,00:42:24.00,You guys can grab your torches.
868,00:42:25.40,00:42:25.40,"Have a long, wet ride back to camp."
