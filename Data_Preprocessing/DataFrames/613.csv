18,00:00:35.43,00:00:35.43,at the end ofthe game with is you.
19,00:00:37.43,00:00:37.43, But it was more than she could stand.
20,00:00:38.90,00:00:38.90,Have you told everybody elsethat you wanted to take me
21,00:00:40.77,00:00:40.77,to the end becauseI'm the only one you can beat?
22,00:00:42.60,00:00:42.60,Did you ever thinkthat I was lying to you?
23,00:00:44.57,00:00:44.57,You'll win the game if youcontinue to screw everybody.

26,00:00:52.77,00:00:52.77, Rob was nervous about Christy's allegiance.
27,00:00:54.60,00:00:54.60,You're still gonna votefor Heidi tonight?
28,00:00:56.23,00:00:56.23,I guess so.
29,00:00:57.23,00:00:57.23,I don't know.
30,00:00:58.73,00:00:58.73,ROB: The threat of Christy defecting terrifies me.
31,00:01:00.63,00:01:00.63,CHRISTY: I'm trying tofigure out what do I need to do
32,00:01:02.80,00:01:02.80, to get to that one million dollars.
33,00:01:04.50,00:01:04.50," I weigh both groups,"
34,00:01:06.53,00:01:06.53,"and I'm, like,I don't know what to do."
35,00:01:08.67,00:01:08.67,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, it was Christy's indecision"
36,00:01:11.07,00:01:11.07, which led to her demise.

38,00:01:16.73,00:01:16.73, Five are left.
39,00:01:19.07,00:01:19.07, Who will be voted out tonight?
40,00:02:35.80,00:02:35.80,JENNA:I feel like I have the flu.
41,00:02:38.07,00:02:38.07,"When I-- my tonsils get bad,"
42,00:02:39.53,00:02:39.53,"like, I-I getwhat's called pharyngitis."
43,00:02:41.97,00:02:41.97,-Right.-Which is not only
44,00:02:43.23,00:02:43.23,"like tonsillitis,but it's an infection"
45,00:02:45.50,00:02:45.50,of my pharynx and larynx.
46,00:02:47.33,00:02:47.33,"-Wow.-And it gets, like, really bad."
47,00:02:49.33,00:02:49.33,And it's miserable.
48,00:02:51.10,00:02:51.10,"JENNA: The hardest thing about the end of this game,"
49,00:02:53.23,00:02:53.23," you're so tired of playing this game, and then"
50,00:02:55.37,00:02:55.37," you have to live with people who you can't trust,"
51,00:02:57.40,00:02:57.40,and that really doeswear on you mentally.
52,00:02:59.07,00:02:59.07,You'd be expectingmore people to be here.
53,00:03:01.43,00:03:01.43,-I know.-This is really it.
54,00:03:02.70,00:03:02.70,There's Team Crazy and us three.
55,00:03:04.47,00:03:04.47,-Mm-hmm.-(chuckles)
56,00:03:05.87,00:03:05.87,"Things change now, like, becauseof what happened last night."
57,00:03:08.70,00:03:08.70,"Like, I don't feel, like, halfas betrayed as I did before."
58,00:03:13.43,00:03:13.43,"If it wasn't for you, one of uswouldn't be here, so..."
59,00:03:15.70,00:03:15.70,"ROB: Amazingly, I really don't sense any animosity"
60,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00," from the two girls, thatthey really are making it clear"
61,00:03:20.77,00:03:20.77, that I saved their ass last night and they're very--
62,00:03:23.07,00:03:23.07, they seem to be very grateful.
63,00:03:24.83,00:03:24.83,"At this point in time,you know, I understand that"
64,00:03:27.40,00:03:27.40,"you need to think about,you know, who you screw over"
65,00:03:29.47,00:03:29.47,is going to be on the jury.
66,00:03:30.80,00:03:30.80,And now it's at the point where
67,00:03:32.13,00:03:32.13,I'm completely honest with them.
68,00:03:33.40,00:03:33.40,"Basically, this iswhat I'm thinking:"
69,00:03:34.77,00:03:34.77,"Um, Heidi, I think I'm gonna,"
70,00:03:35.87,00:03:35.87,I'm gonna vote-votefor you next.
71,00:03:38.03,00:03:38.03,Okay.
72,00:03:39.13,00:03:39.13,"And then, and then Jenna,but you know"
73,00:03:41.63,00:03:41.63,-Okay.-that-that we're-we're so close
74,00:03:43.00,00:03:43.00,"to the end, that immunitiescould screw any--"
75,00:03:44.53,00:03:44.53,could screw anything up.
76,00:03:45.97,00:03:45.97,I think it's a smooth movebecause once they think--
77,00:03:48.37,00:03:48.37,even though Butch is a moron...
78,00:03:49.70,00:03:49.70,Mm-hmm.
79,00:03:50.97,00:03:50.97,"...you, you know,against him is a lock."
80,00:03:53.50,00:03:53.50,I did think about-aboutif I was to flip-flop here
81,00:03:56.87,00:03:56.87,"and then go-go withyou two to the end,"
82,00:04:00.17,00:04:00.17,but then I would just screw overevery single person
83,00:04:02.97,00:04:02.97,that I've ever come incontact with in the game
84,00:04:04.70,00:04:04.70,and I would just look likethe biggest ... ever.
85,00:04:07.33,00:04:07.33,Mm-hmm.
86,00:04:08.83,00:04:08.83,"And, uh..."
87,00:04:09.90,00:04:09.90,And you care about thatat this point?
88,00:04:11.90,00:04:11.90,-(laughs)-The jury...
89,00:04:13.03,00:04:13.03,ROB: Telling the girls my plans
90,00:04:14.40,00:04:14.40, to vote off Heidi and then Jenna
91,00:04:15.93,00:04:15.93, was actually very well received.
92,00:04:17.17,00:04:17.17, It seems like
93,00:04:18.40,00:04:18.40,people don't get too madwhen you tell them that.
94,00:04:20.13,00:04:20.13,"They're just like,""Oh, okay, cool."""
95,00:04:22.20,00:04:22.20,"And, uh, I don't think they haveanything up their sleeves."
96,00:04:24.97,00:04:24.97,"That's what I'm saying:we're sitting here thanking Rob,"
97,00:04:27.03,00:04:27.03,"you know what I mean, but reallyit was us that got us here."
98,00:04:30.07,00:04:30.07,"Yeah, I know."
99,00:04:31.13,00:04:31.13,"I mean, I can'texpress that to him."
100,00:04:32.77,00:04:32.77,We've got three days.
101,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,All I know isI'm going out fighting.
102,00:04:59.27,00:04:59.27,You got a lot.
103,00:05:01.40,00:05:01.40,"Let me tell you girls right now,I got firewood,"
104,00:05:04.67,00:05:04.67,gonna keep the fireburning for three days.
105,00:05:08.20,00:05:08.20,This is the best firewoodthat you could find.
106,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,Why? We have eight poundsof firewood
107,00:05:12.73,00:05:12.73,and the biggest logI've ever seen in my life.
108,00:05:15.00,00:05:15.00,I don't know why.
109,00:05:16.00,00:05:16.00,Butch said thatI have to get firewood.
110,00:05:18.13,00:05:18.13,(laughs)
111,00:05:19.13,00:05:19.13,Butch done lost his mind.
112,00:05:23.23,00:05:23.23,Yeah.
113,00:05:24.93,00:05:24.93,This good stuff?
114,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,Is it dry?
115,00:05:28.20,00:05:28.20,ROB: I don't know what Butch's
116,00:05:29.63,00:05:29.63,obsession with firewood is.
117,00:05:31.70,00:05:31.70," When Butch wakes up in the morning,"
118,00:05:34.20,00:05:34.20," the first thing he says is,"
119,00:05:35.90,00:05:35.90," ""We need to go get some firewood."""
120,00:05:37.37,00:05:37.37,Good stuff.
121,00:05:38.77,00:05:38.77,Dry.
122,00:05:40.10,00:05:40.10," When he gets back from getting firewood, he says,"
123,00:05:42.53,00:05:42.53," ""I think we need to get some more wood."""
124,00:05:44.93,00:05:44.93,And he's adamant about the wood.
125,00:05:49.17,00:05:49.17,"Butch, what you doing?"
126,00:05:50.83,00:05:50.83,More firewood.
127,00:05:51.93,00:05:51.93,"Ooh, it's dry."
128,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57,"Butch, you love your firewood."
129,00:05:55.37,00:05:55.37,I love to work.
130,00:05:56.67,00:05:56.67,"If you're gonna besuccessful in life, Rob..."
131,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,-Yes? -...you can't sit backon your haunches
132,00:06:00.13,00:06:00.13,"and let somebody else do itfor you, you know what I mean?"
133,00:06:02.53,00:06:02.53,"Gotta get out there,get the fire..."
134,00:06:05.30,00:06:05.30,Just get what you can handle.That's good.
135,00:06:07.13,00:06:07.13,"Don't-Don't try to do too much,"
136,00:06:08.37,00:06:08.37,'cause we gotseveral trips we can make.
137,00:06:10.10,00:06:10.10,All right.
138,00:06:11.43,00:06:11.43,ROB: I don't know how I necessarily became
139,00:06:13.43,00:06:13.43, the junior deputy firewood bitch.
140,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,"I'm gettingmy good shirt dirty, Butch."
141,00:06:19.23,00:06:19.23,I don't want to bea team with Butch.
142,00:06:21.00,00:06:21.00,This is the good w--
143,00:06:23.03,00:06:23.03,"What's so great about this,"
144,00:06:24.77,00:06:24.77,as opposed to anything elsethat's in this forest?
145,00:06:28.00,00:06:28.00,JENNA: We have so much firewood; it's everywhere.
146,00:06:30.07,00:06:30.07," It's under the shelter, it's by the fire."
147,00:06:32.33,00:06:32.33," I mean, we have huge logs"
148,00:06:33.60,00:06:33.60, in our shelter we're not using anymore.
149,00:06:35.03,00:06:35.03,I don't know what he does.
150,00:06:36.10,00:06:36.10,I don't knowif he talks to the wood.
151,00:06:37.23,00:06:37.23,"Ooh, man, this is nice."
152,00:06:39.10,00:06:39.10,BUTCH: Fire is very important.
153,00:06:40.50,00:06:40.50, That's the reason why I keep wanting to get
154,00:06:42.23,00:06:42.23, some more wood and keep it dry as we possibly can
155,00:06:45.50,00:06:45.50, to have it for an emergency.
156,00:06:47.07,00:06:47.07,"I'm just a wood-crazy nut,I guess."
157,00:06:48.50,00:06:48.50,"The sun's coming out, baby."
158,00:06:50.53,00:06:50.53,"I want to tell you, it'scoming out-- it's about 1:00."
159,00:06:52.57,00:06:52.57,"About three hours of dry time,that's gonna be dry,"
160,00:06:55.23,00:06:55.23,the wood we're gonnatake out there.
161,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,"Gonna put that over there,"
162,00:06:58.13,00:06:58.13,we're gonna be readyto rock and roll.

164,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,And why are we gonna be ableto rock and roll?
165,00:07:04.47,00:07:04.47,'Cause I'm gonna dance tonight.
166,00:07:07.47,00:07:07.47,My wife saysI embarrass her when I dance.
167,00:07:09.47,00:07:09.47,I don't know why.
168,00:07:10.67,00:07:10.67,(laughing)
169,00:07:16.47,00:07:16.47,(laughing)
170,00:07:25.43,00:07:25.43,(Rob trumpets a fanfare)

178,00:07:43.80,00:07:43.80,Wow.
179,00:07:45.20,00:07:45.20,"BUTCH: This being the last reward, uh, all of us"
180,00:07:49.33,00:07:49.33,are anticipating it beinga big juicy reward.
181,00:07:52.40,00:07:52.40,"If it starts to rain,we'll put this under there."

200,00:08:52.33,00:08:52.33,"Just, tonsils are getting big."
201,00:08:53.47,00:08:53.47,Maybe getting a little caseof tonsillitis.
202,00:08:54.93,00:08:54.93,That's definitely not working
203,00:08:56.20,00:08:56.20,"towards my advantage,but I'm a little girl."

414,00:19:59.20,00:19:59.20, like my pledge crown.
415,00:20:00.57,00:20:00.57, My Zeta jacket can't be replaced
416,00:20:02.43,00:20:02.43, because it's-it's passed down from sister to sister.
417,00:20:05.07,00:20:05.07, So I can never get that back.
418,00:20:12.43,00:20:12.43,Don't you feel totally lucky?
419,00:20:14.57,00:20:14.57,All that stuff you saved.
420,00:20:17.93,00:20:17.93,"No, it kills me...to know how much everybody lost."
421,00:20:21.53,00:20:21.53,HEIDI: I totally felt guilt
422,00:20:23.03,00:20:23.03, about being the only person that had a pack remaining.
423,00:20:27.07,00:20:27.07," I mean, most people would be like, ""Whoo-hoo!"""
424,00:20:28.47,00:20:28.47," you know, ""My stuff's still here!"""
425,00:20:29.83,00:20:29.83," I was like, ""I wish my stuff would have been burnt,"
426,00:20:32.30,00:20:32.30," just like everybody else's."""
427,00:20:33.97,00:20:33.97,"That way,I could just, you know,"
428,00:20:35.63,00:20:35.63,be on the same level with them.
429,00:20:37.17,00:20:37.17,"So what-what do we needto do, Butch?"
430,00:20:39.13,00:20:39.13,Just get the logs off?
431,00:20:40.77,00:20:40.77,"Uh, I think we probably--"
432,00:20:42.30,00:20:42.30,first thing we want to do iswant to get this down.
433,00:20:45.17,00:20:45.17,We're gonna haveto use this stuff.
434,00:20:46.60,00:20:46.60,"BUTCH: The first thing that came to my mind was,"
435,00:20:48.57,00:20:48.57," ""God, could it be my fault?"" you know."
436,00:20:50.13,00:20:50.13, We'll never know.But was it disappointing? Yeah.
437,00:20:52.30,00:20:52.30," I lost my sign,"
438,00:20:53.87,00:20:53.87,"uh, ""Believe In Yourself,"" sonow we're really gonna have to"
439,00:20:56.17,00:20:56.17,believe in ourselves to make itthrough the next five days.
440,00:20:59.60,00:20:59.60,I'm just... blown away.
441,00:21:04.20,00:21:04.20,Unbelievable.
442,00:21:08.20,00:21:08.20,"MATTHEW: Make the toast, dude."
443,00:21:09.47,00:21:09.47,-To two.-To two.
444,00:21:11.87,00:21:11.87,"It's gonna be us, dude."
445,00:21:14.87,00:21:14.87,"What do you want,a burger or hot dog first?"
446,00:21:16.67,00:21:16.67,Hot dog.
447,00:21:17.87,00:21:17.87,I love hot dogs so much.
448,00:21:19.80,00:21:19.80,"Bon appétit, dude."
449,00:21:21.37,00:21:21.37,MATTHEW: It's just such a great thing to see two
450,00:21:24.63,00:21:24.63,really different people
451,00:21:25.77,00:21:25.77,with different strategiescome together.
452,00:21:27.60,00:21:27.60,"I mean, I learned the gamethrough Rob,"
453,00:21:29.70,00:21:29.70,"and, uh, he learnedsurvival skills, you know,"
454,00:21:32.30,00:21:32.30,"through watching me, and hehelped me a lot initially,"
455,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,and I'm helping him a lot now.
456,00:21:36.83,00:21:36.83,I've run out of credit.
457,00:21:38.10,00:21:38.10,My trust...nobody trusts me anymore.
458,00:21:40.03,00:21:40.03,-Right. Except for me.-Yep.
459,00:21:42.30,00:21:42.30,And I do because you'rethe reason I'm here today.
460,00:21:46.63,00:21:46.63,"So many times, you came through"
461,00:21:48.07,00:21:48.07,and gave mejust enough information.
462,00:21:50.73,00:21:50.73,"-It's just like, you wouldn'tbe here without me... -Yep."
463,00:21:53.47,00:21:53.47,...I wouldn't be ableto finish this out without you.
464,00:21:55.60,00:21:55.60,Yep. Right.
465,00:21:56.73,00:21:56.73,ROB: I've taken us to this point.
466,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83, There's no more moves I can make.
467,00:22:01.20,00:22:01.20,I've done all I can doto get us to this point.
468,00:22:03.73,00:22:03.73," Matt is the player that's in the driver's seat, not me."
469,00:22:06.73,00:22:06.73, I'm shotgun right at this point in the game.
470,00:22:09.43,00:22:09.43,-Not one other personin this game... -Yep.
471,00:22:11.17,00:22:11.17,"would... would, uh...would-would..."
472,00:22:12.97,00:22:12.97,-would trust me to goto the end. -Right.
473,00:22:15.10,00:22:15.10,"And, for that,I owe you everything."
474,00:22:17.13,00:22:17.13,Right. Yep.
475,00:22:18.53,00:22:18.53,MATTHEW: I'm so stoked that I've crafted
476,00:22:21.60,00:22:21.60, very strong relationships with both Rob
477,00:22:25.93,00:22:25.93,"and Butch,and as far as they know,"
478,00:22:28.40,00:22:28.40,I'm going to the final twowith each of them.
479,00:22:30.83,00:22:30.83,"Dude, I gotta say good-byeto my car. Dude, I-I'm so..."
480,00:22:32.77,00:22:32.77,"Where are you going to put it,long-term parking?"
481,00:22:34.33,00:22:34.33,I guess so.
482,00:22:35.90,00:22:35.90,MATTHEW: I feel like I've got two options now locked in.
483,00:22:38.87,00:22:38.87," Now, if I have to choose later on,"
484,00:22:41.43,00:22:41.43," it's going to be difficult,"
485,00:22:42.97,00:22:42.97," and one of them is going to be stabbed in the back,"
486,00:22:45.77,00:22:45.77,and that will bethe first time in the game
487,00:22:47.37,00:22:47.37,that I've had to do thatto get ahead.
488,00:22:53.90,00:22:53.90,Once I get some coalsstarted here...
489,00:22:56.53,00:22:56.53,I dug a little holein the ground.
490,00:22:58.27,00:22:58.27,"-I see that. -So onceI get some coals started,"
491,00:23:00.43,00:23:00.43,all we gotta dois just maintain
492,00:23:02.13,00:23:02.13,"-one or two logs onthat fire, okay? -Right."
493,00:23:04.10,00:23:04.10,We got nothing.
494,00:23:06.30,00:23:06.30,Can't believe it.
495,00:23:08.53,00:23:08.53,Whose fault?
496,00:23:10.87,00:23:10.87,"It's all of ours, I guess."
497,00:23:12.27,00:23:12.27,Shouldn't have had the woodin there. I don't know.
498,00:23:13.83,00:23:13.83,Maybe we had too big a fire.
499,00:23:15.03,00:23:15.03,JENNA:I don't know.
500,00:23:17.23,00:23:17.23,"Damned if you do,you're damned if you don't."
501,00:23:18.87,00:23:18.87,"Yeah, you're right."
502,00:23:20.43,00:23:20.43,All right.
503,00:23:22.93,00:23:22.93,I... I am eternallygrateful once again.
504,00:23:27.43,00:23:27.43,Dude.
505,00:23:30.47,00:23:30.47,MATTHEW:My pleasure.
506,00:23:32.23,00:23:32.23,You've earned it.
507,00:23:34.13,00:23:34.13,What's happeningwith the fire over there?
508,00:23:38.00,00:23:38.00,We had a little problem.
509,00:23:39.80,00:23:39.80,The shelter burned down.
510,00:23:41.50,00:23:41.50,-The shelter burned down?-Yeah.
511,00:23:42.97,00:23:42.97,-And all of our packs...-All the packs.
512,00:23:44.17,00:23:44.17,...except Heidi's were burnt.
513,00:23:45.20,00:23:45.20,-(gasps) -Holy...-They're all...
514,00:23:47.03,00:23:47.03,Everything we have is gone.
515,00:23:48.40,00:23:48.40,"Clothes, everything."
516,00:23:50.70,00:23:50.70,Dude.
517,00:23:51.97,00:23:51.97,We had to rebuildwhile you guys were gone.
518,00:23:55.47,00:23:55.47,Unbelievable.
519,00:23:57.77,00:23:57.77,Catastrophe.
520,00:23:59.83,00:23:59.83,ROB: Everything I had to help me with survival is gone.
521,00:24:05.40,00:24:05.40,That's a blow.
522,00:24:07.33,00:24:07.33,"That really is a blow, and..."
523,00:24:10.30,00:24:10.30,"outside of somebodygetting hurt,"
524,00:24:12.73,00:24:12.73,that's the worst thingthat could happen to one of us.
525,00:24:16.50,00:24:16.50,"You guys, this sucks."
526,00:24:18.63,00:24:18.63,I know.
527,00:24:19.93,00:24:19.93,"I had stuff that's beenpassed down for, like,"
528,00:24:22.00,00:24:22.00,"five years, six yearsthat I can never get back."
529,00:24:24.67,00:24:24.67,"Dude, I don't have anything warmto wear at night."
530,00:24:27.57,00:24:27.57,I know.
531,00:24:29.93,00:24:29.93,"MATTHEW: I believe in fate,"
532,00:24:31.67,00:24:31.67, and this was probably unavoidable.
533,00:24:34.13,00:24:34.13, I could see how it happened.
534,00:24:35.93,00:24:35.93, There was a... an awful lot of wood stacked there.
535,00:24:38.13,00:24:38.13, And I'm not going to point any fingers
536,00:24:40.90,00:24:40.90,"because we don't do thatin this tribe,"
537,00:24:43.50,00:24:43.50,"um, but in hindsight,it was basically,"
538,00:24:47.00,00:24:47.00,"you know,an inferno waiting to happen."
539,00:24:49.80,00:24:49.80,"It got hot, and then it ignited,and then, once it ignited,"
540,00:24:53.53,00:24:53.53,"then, uh, the wood right by it--why wouldn't it burn, too?"
541,00:24:56.40,00:24:56.40,The wood...I don't think the wood...
542,00:24:58.70,00:24:58.70,Do you think the woodright next to it...?
543,00:25:00.23,00:25:00.23,"See, it was a small firewe left."
544,00:25:02.23,00:25:02.23,JENNA:It all caught. All of it.
545,00:25:03.67,00:25:03.67,It all caught.
546,00:25:04.87,00:25:04.87,Doesn't make any differencehow it happened.
547,00:25:06.07,00:25:06.07,It caught and burned.
548,00:25:07.20,00:25:07.20,Hm.
549,00:25:08.80,00:25:08.80,"ROB: I'm not one for conspiracy theories,"
550,00:25:12.67,00:25:12.67, but I do know this:
551,00:25:14.47,00:25:14.47," with about 137 days worth of dry wood,"
552,00:25:19.47,00:25:19.47, our camp burnt to the ground.
553,00:25:22.10,00:25:22.10, Was there a connection? I don't know.
554,00:25:24.53,00:25:24.53,I'm not one to point fingers.
555,00:25:26.00,00:25:26.00,(coughing):Butch.
556,00:25:28.30,00:25:28.30,"Dude, this is unbelievable."
557,00:25:37.93,00:25:37.93,(thunder rumbling)
558,00:25:48.80,00:25:48.80,"So everyone knows, there'sa rumbling in the distance."
559,00:25:51.63,00:25:51.63,ROB: I know. That's whyI'm jumping out of bed now.
560,00:25:55.13,00:25:55.13,"I'm, um, getting the vines readyfor the fire shelter."
561,00:26:00.33,00:26:00.33,"MATTHEW: Plan of attack is not to sleep this morning,"
562,00:26:02.93,00:26:02.93," but to build another fire shelter,"
563,00:26:04.53,00:26:04.53," and what we'll do differently this time is,"
564,00:26:07.33,00:26:07.33,"we won't be stacking any woodaround the fire any longer,"
565,00:26:11.47,00:26:11.47, unless there's someone here to watch over it very closely.
566,00:26:26.60,00:26:26.60,HEIDI: Butch is the person I want voted off.
567,00:26:29.13,00:26:29.13, I want Butch to go before me and Jenna.
568,00:26:31.43,00:26:31.43," I mean, I feel like we've earned it,"
569,00:26:33.13,00:26:33.13,"we've worked our butts off,we've not been careless,"
570,00:26:35.47,00:26:35.47,we didn't burn down the camp.
571,00:26:37.03,00:26:37.03," But, uh, the three guys"
572,00:26:38.83,00:26:38.83," that we're up against right now, there's no way."
573,00:26:41.03,00:26:41.03, They are hardcore alliance.
574,00:26:43.67,00:26:43.67, There's no way to break that.
575,00:26:47.83,00:26:47.83," This morning, I watched the three boys"
576,00:26:50.80,00:26:50.80," try to rebuild the fire as much as they could,"
577,00:26:53.10,00:26:53.10, gathering all these beautiful palm fronds
578,00:26:55.43,00:26:55.43, and new sticks and all this stuff.
579,00:26:57.43,00:26:57.43," I said to Jenna, ""You know, I feel bad"
580,00:26:59.37,00:26:59.37," for not helping them,"" and then I go,"
581,00:27:01.30,00:27:01.30,"""Nah, I really don't."""
582,00:27:04.77,00:27:04.77,(whispering)
583,00:27:06.50,00:27:06.50,(Jenna chuckles)
584,00:27:07.97,00:27:07.97,JENNA: We're not doing any work for them.
585,00:27:09.80,00:27:09.80,"Why? You're goingto vote us off,"
586,00:27:11.17,00:27:11.17,we're not doing crap for you.
587,00:27:12.53,00:27:12.53,We're making your life easier.
588,00:27:18.57,00:27:18.57, I'm definitely grateful they built a shelter
589,00:27:20.70,00:27:20.70," 'cause we need it 'cause itrains, and we really needed it,"
590,00:27:22.87,00:27:22.87, but I'm just not... I won't help.
591,00:27:27.87,00:27:27.87,"MATTHEW: If I were Heidi, if I were Jenna,"
592,00:27:31.83,00:27:31.83," I would work real hard, help out at camp,"
593,00:27:34.70,00:27:34.70, try to convince people that I shouldn't be the first to go.
594,00:27:37.73,00:27:37.73, They're just digging a deeper grave
595,00:27:39.57,00:27:39.57,"for themselves,as far as I'm concerned."
596,00:27:56.57,00:27:56.57,"Come on in, guys."
597,00:28:01.70,00:28:01.70,What happenedto the immunity necklace?
598,00:28:04.73,00:28:04.73,(laughs) The right sidegot a little scorched.
599,00:28:07.30,00:28:07.30,-Thrashed.-What happened?
600,00:28:09.23,00:28:09.23,-A fire.-A fire issue.
601,00:28:10.63,00:28:10.63,"BUTCH: We rebuilta new fire, uh, hut"
602,00:28:13.03,00:28:13.03,"and a new, um, place to sleep."
603,00:28:14.43,00:28:14.43,"We lost a lot of stuffthat we need,"
604,00:28:15.87,00:28:15.87,"but it's gut-check time,so we turned it up a notch."
605,00:28:19.13,00:28:19.13,-Let's go.-PROBST: Okay.
606,00:28:21.30,00:28:21.30,We're getting down to it.
607,00:28:22.93,00:28:22.93,"For today's immunity challenge,"
608,00:28:24.57,00:28:24.57,you must navigate your waythrough our ropes course.
609,00:28:27.13,00:28:27.13,There are five individualrope obstacles.
610,00:28:30.90,00:28:30.90,"In no particular order,"
611,00:28:32.17,00:28:32.17,"you'll make your wayalong the disc walk,"

613,00:28:37.33,00:28:37.33,you'll use the rope swing

615,00:28:40.63,00:28:40.63,"you'll use the swing steps,"

623,00:29:03.77,00:29:03.77,I need that necklace back.

694,00:32:58.73,00:32:58.73,but no less impactfulor important.
695,00:33:00.40,00:33:00.40,You are safe from the vote.
696,00:33:02.30,00:33:02.30,One of the four of you--going home.
697,00:33:04.93,00:33:04.93,You guys can head back to camp.I'll see you at Tribal Council.
698,00:33:25.43,00:33:25.43,(chopping)
699,00:33:45.00,00:33:45.00,"Oh, I can't do this anymore."
700,00:33:47.20,00:33:47.20,HEIDI:What's the matter?
701,00:33:48.27,00:33:48.27,I can't do this anymore.
702,00:33:50.60,00:33:50.60,I feel like crap.
703,00:33:52.83,00:33:52.83,I hate every minuteof being here.
704,00:33:55.97,00:33:55.97,There are so many things
705,00:33:57.67,00:33:57.67,"that are more importantto me right now,"
706,00:33:59.40,00:33:59.40,and I just can't...I can't even walk.
707,00:34:01.30,00:34:01.30,"Like, every time I walk,"
708,00:34:03.03,00:34:03.03,"I take five steps, and I...I'm, like, about to collapse."
709,00:34:07.90,00:34:07.90,"I'm having, like,chest... chest pains,"
710,00:34:10.43,00:34:10.43,and everything just falls apart.
711,00:34:13.30,00:34:13.30,This is the last thingI wanted to do
712,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,"on the last couple days,is be a big baby."
713,00:34:18.57,00:34:18.57,"HEIDI:You're not, Jenna."
714,00:34:19.73,00:34:19.73,But I...there's nothing I can do.
715,00:34:21.60,00:34:21.60,I'm stuck... here.
716,00:34:23.90,00:34:23.90,Nothing's working.Nothing's getting better.
717,00:34:26.83,00:34:26.83,HEIDI: Jenna's physical state right now is not good.
718,00:34:29.73,00:34:29.73," I want to make sure that every possibility,"
719,00:34:33.03,00:34:33.03,every chance of me stayingin this game is here.
720,00:34:35.13,00:34:35.13,How am I supposed to enjoymy last couple days here
721,00:34:37.77,00:34:37.77,when I can't even do anything?
722,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,(sniffling)
723,00:34:42.13,00:34:42.13,(sighs)This is miserable.
724,00:34:43.73,00:34:43.73,ROB:Is there anything I can do?
725,00:34:45.63,00:34:45.63,"Nope, there's nothing."
726,00:34:46.97,00:34:46.97,It's nobody's fault.
727,00:34:48.10,00:34:48.10,"Like, there's nothing I can do."
728,00:34:49.40,00:34:49.40,I just hate feeling helpless.
729,00:34:51.17,00:34:51.17,"Just, seriously, take my coatand just lay down."
730,00:34:53.93,00:34:53.93,"I-I... just, like...I'm so uncomfortable, though."
731,00:34:55.90,00:34:55.90,-I know.-I can't...
732,00:34:57.03,00:34:57.03,I can't even close my eyes.
733,00:34:58.57,00:34:58.57,"HEIDI: Definitely, having Jenna voted out"
734,00:34:59.80,00:34:59.80, before me works to my advantage.
735,00:35:01.40,00:35:01.40, Knowing that we have to get ready to vote somebody off
736,00:35:03.80,00:35:03.80, makes me want to campaign for her
737,00:35:05.97,00:35:05.97,to go off to the boys.
738,00:35:08.27,00:35:08.27,You don't understandhow sick she is.
739,00:35:09.93,00:35:09.93,But it's only one day more.
740,00:35:11.73,00:35:11.73,"-It's not like...-Uh, exactly."
741,00:35:13.40,00:35:13.40,-It's only one day.-It's not like...
742,00:35:14.83,00:35:14.83,So I don't understandwhy it matters.
743,00:35:16.30,00:35:16.30,And she is...this is killing me.
744,00:35:20.50,00:35:20.50,"She is genuinely, genuinelyconcerned about her health."
745,00:35:24.67,00:35:24.67,"-I know. -And she feelslike just that one extra day,"
746,00:35:27.07,00:35:27.07,she will not make it.
747,00:35:28.67,00:35:28.67,"What do you mean, she won't...she won't make it?"
748,00:35:30.23,00:35:30.23,"-I don't know. She just...-Like, she'll die?"
749,00:35:31.70,00:35:31.70,"No, but she feels like shejust mentally can't handle it."
750,00:35:34.43,00:35:34.43,I don't know.
751,00:35:35.67,00:35:35.67,ROB: There are a couple of different reasons
752,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03, why somebody would want to vote for Jenna tonight.
753,00:35:40.60,00:35:40.60," She's whining, and she's sick."
754,00:35:43.40,00:35:43.40,(sighs)This is miserable.
755,00:35:45.63,00:35:45.63, And those are two things that you should try to avoid
756,00:35:49.07,00:35:49.07," at these stages in the game, because if you're willing"
757,00:35:53.03,00:35:53.03," to put your head on the chopping block,"
758,00:35:54.90,00:35:54.90,I'm willing to lop it off.
759,00:36:22.73,00:36:22.73,Now bring inthe members of our jury.
760,00:36:24.73,00:36:24.73,"Dave, Deena, Alex and Christy--"
761,00:36:29.43,00:36:29.43,voted outat the last Tribal Council.
762,00:36:34.57,00:36:34.57,So let's start talkingabout the last three days.
763,00:36:37.77,00:36:37.77,"Take me through it, Butch."
764,00:36:39.27,00:36:39.27,The big event--you came back to camp
765,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43,after our reward challengeand discovered...?
766,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27,"We discovered a, um...there'd been a, uh, fire."
767,00:36:47.17,00:36:47.17,It was... I call ita total destruction fire.
768,00:36:49.90,00:36:49.90,"Our whole campwas destroyed by, um, fire--"
769,00:36:51.97,00:36:51.97,all of our belongings.
770,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,"Um, what you see with..."
771,00:36:55.10,00:36:55.10,"with us now, basically,is what we have."
772,00:36:57.37,00:36:57.37,"Matthew, how do you suspectthe fire started?"
773,00:37:00.53,00:37:00.53,"Um, there was lot of wood drying"
774,00:37:03.07,00:37:03.07,"behind, um, the firethat we left to burn."
775,00:37:06.83,00:37:06.83,So what I imagine happenedis that the wood
776,00:37:09.77,00:37:09.77,"that we left burning ignitedsome of the dry wood behind it,"
777,00:37:13.60,00:37:13.60,"and then ignitedthe fire shelter itself,"
778,00:37:17.10,00:37:17.10,so it was basicallytotal destruction.
779,00:37:19.57,00:37:19.57,"PROBST: Butch, I know,in the past, you've told me"
780,00:37:21.57,00:37:21.57,that collecting woodwas your big deal.
781,00:37:23.43,00:37:23.43,And listeningto what Matthew talked about
782,00:37:25.57,00:37:25.57,"with the fireand what might have happened,"
783,00:37:27.47,00:37:27.47,did you feel any initialresponsibility that maybe
784,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,"""all of my ferociouswood collecting"
785,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,"actually might have helpedspark this fire?"""
786,00:37:35.50,00:37:35.50,"Yes, at first, I did,but then, um,"
787,00:37:37.97,00:37:37.97,"there are so many variablesthat could've happened, uh..."
788,00:37:40.97,00:37:40.97,I feel comfortable thatit wasn't... wasn't my fault.
789,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,"PROBST:Now, in addition to the fire,"
790,00:37:45.07,00:37:45.07,we have some rain coming downright now at Tribal Council.
791,00:37:48.03,00:37:48.03,"Jenna, it's been a toughlast few days,"
792,00:37:50.43,00:37:50.43,"I know, for you,with not feeling well."
793,00:37:52.77,00:37:52.77,"Then you come back to camp,you have a fire."
794,00:37:54.60,00:37:54.60,Then Mother Nature downpours.
795,00:37:55.93,00:37:55.93,How you doing?
796,00:37:57.20,00:37:57.20,"Uh, I don't knowwhat's going on."
797,00:37:59.63,00:37:59.63,"I got some sort of tonsillitisin the jungle,"
798,00:38:03.33,00:38:03.33,and it's impossible for meto recover
799,00:38:05.73,00:38:05.73,because I just...there's just...
800,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,"we're not eating enough stuff,so..."
801,00:38:09.90,00:38:09.90,"-it's been hard. -PROBST: Well,at this point in the game,"
802,00:38:12.37,00:38:12.37,I'm sure everybody's thinking
803,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,about making itto the final two.
804,00:38:15.53,00:38:15.53,"Jenna, what is your basisfor who you would want to take"
805,00:38:20.50,00:38:20.50,"to the final two,if it were up to you?"
806,00:38:22.57,00:38:22.57,"If-if anybody...everybody who knows me knows,"
807,00:38:24.77,00:38:24.77,"at this point,it would be loyalty."
808,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,I-I... I would rather go up
809,00:38:29.00,00:38:29.00,against somebodywho I really care about
810,00:38:30.67,00:38:30.67,and I know was a great playerand that be it.
811,00:38:34.10,00:38:34.10,"Like, I wouldn't want to go up"
812,00:38:35.80,00:38:35.80,"against somebodyI knew I could beat,"
813,00:38:37.13,00:38:37.13,because it's not competition.
814,00:38:39.37,00:38:39.37,"Heidi, do you think you deserveto be in the final two?"
