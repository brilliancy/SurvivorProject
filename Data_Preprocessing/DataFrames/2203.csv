591,00:28:59.38,00:28:59.38,THE CLUE BASICALLY COULD HAVE
592,00:29:01.21,00:29:01.21,"READ ""THE HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL IS SOMEWHERE."""
593,00:29:04.17,00:29:04.17,"I MEAN, IT COULD BE ANYWHERE."
594,00:29:07.08,00:29:07.08,I'M HAPPY THAT I FOUND THE CLUE
595,00:29:08.92,00:29:08.92,BECAUSE I KNOW NOW THAT NOBODY ELSE FOUND THE CLUE.
596,00:29:11.29,00:29:11.29,I'M GOING DOWN FOR A LITTLE CRAB ATTACK.
597,00:29:13.29,00:29:13.29,BUT I DON'T PLAN ON TELLING
598,00:29:14.75,00:29:14.75,ANYBODY ABOUT THE CLUE BECAUSE I WANT THE IDOL FOR ME.
599,00:29:31.67,00:29:31.67,>> LET'S GET THE FIRE GOING.
600,00:29:33.08,00:29:33.08,>> I'LL GET IT. I'LL GET IT.
601,00:29:35.08,00:29:35.08,"WELL, IT WAS A THROWN CHALLENGE."
602,00:29:37.67,00:29:37.67,BECAUSE WE DO GOTTA GET RUSSELL OUT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.
603,00:29:41.12,00:29:41.12,"RUSSELL THINKS HE RUNS THE SHOW, AND HE DON'T."
604,00:29:45.08,00:29:45.08,HE'S NOT MY BOSS AND HE'S NOT BOSS OF ME.
605,00:29:48.54,00:29:48.54,>> DO WE HAVE A PLAN?
606,00:29:52.12,00:29:52.12,>> YEAH. >> STICKING TO THAT?
607,00:29:53.62,00:29:53.62,>> STICKING TO THE PLAN.
608,00:29:55.08,00:29:55.08,WE'RE GOING TO GO 3-3.
609,00:29:56.92,00:29:56.92,>> THE PLAN TONIGHT IS TO GIVE THREE VOTES TO RUSSELL AND THREE
610,00:30:00.08,00:30:00.08,"VOTES TO STEPHANIE IN THE ABSOLUTELY REMOTE, RARE EVENT"
611,00:30:05.58,00:30:05.58,THAT RUSSELL DID FIND AN IDOL.
612,00:30:07.12,00:30:07.12,"SO IF EVERYTHING GOES AS PLANNED TONIGHT, RUSSELL WILL GO HOME."
613,00:30:11.08,00:30:11.08,>> IT'S STUPID TO THROW
614,00:30:12.21,00:30:12.21,CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ARE ONLY TWO UP.
615,00:30:14.29,00:30:14.29,"I CAN SEE IF YOU'RE FIVE UP OR SOMETHING, FOUR UP, MAYBE."
616,00:30:17.88,00:30:17.88,>> YEAH.
617,00:30:18.96,00:30:18.96,>> BUT TWO UP?
618,00:30:20.58,00:30:20.58,WHEN THE GAME JUST STARTED?
619,00:30:23.00,00:30:23.00,WHAT DO THEY WANT TO GO EVEN AT THE MERGE?
620,00:30:25.83,00:30:25.83,I THINK THEY THREW THE CHALLENGE.
621,00:30:28.25,00:30:28.25,IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH
622,00:30:30.25,00:30:30.25,BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WIN RIGHT NOW.
623,00:30:32.00,00:30:32.00,YOU CAN'T GIVE BOSTON ROB MOMENTUM.
624,00:30:33.88,00:30:33.88,NOT IN THIS GAME.
625,00:30:35.12,00:30:35.12,"IF THEY SPLIT THE VOTES, IT WILL BE A TWO-WAY TIE."
626,00:30:38.21,00:30:38.21,"ONE WILL BE SAFE, THEY WOULD REVOTE AND I WOULD GO HOME."
627,00:30:41.29,00:30:41.29,I HAVE TO CONVINCE SOMEBODY TO FLIP.
628,00:30:43.88,00:30:43.88,ONE PERSON.
629,00:30:46.38,00:30:46.38,">> TONIGHT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL, WE WERE THINKING THE VOTES WOULD BE"
630,00:30:50.04,00:30:50.04,SPLIT 3-3-3 BECAUSE THEY WOULD WANT TO FLUSH OUT THE IDOL AND
631,00:30:53.21,00:30:53.21,GET RID OF ONE OF US.
632,00:30:55.04,00:30:55.04,SO ALL IT WOULD TAKE IS FOR ONE OF THEIR SIX TO FLIP ON THEM AND
633,00:30:59.29,00:30:59.29,"VOTE WITH US, SO THAT WE WOULD GET THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTES."
634,00:31:03.29,00:31:03.29,>> DO YOU THINK... THE OLD LADY WILL?
635,00:31:12.17,00:31:12.17,>> OKAY.
636,00:31:14.58,00:31:14.58,>> WOULD IT BE WEIRD IF I ASKED YOU WHERE DO YOU THINK EXACTLY
637,00:31:18.00,00:31:18.00,YOU STAND WITH THE SIX PEOPLE YOU HAVE?
638,00:31:20.12,00:31:20.12,"WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR ONE, TWO, THREE."
639,00:31:23.04,00:31:23.04,>> RIGHT. YOU GUYS ARE STRONG.
640,00:31:24.62,00:31:24.62,>> YOU KNOW. >> I DON'T KNOW.
641,00:31:26.92,00:31:26.92,">> WELL, WE HAVE STUFF UP OUR SLEEVES."
642,00:31:30.08,00:31:30.08,">> YEAH. >> BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,"
643,00:31:32.25,00:31:32.25,WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE FOURTH PERSON.
644,00:31:36.04,00:31:36.04,">> SEE, AND RUSSELL KNOWS HOW TO GET TO THE END."
645,00:31:38.29,00:31:38.29,>> AND WE HAVE THE IDOL. >> RIGHT ON.
646,00:31:40.58,00:31:40.58,>> WE SHOULD SIT DOWN. I'M GETTING...
647,00:31:42.79,00:31:42.79,>> YOU'RE GETTING LIGHTHEADED.
648,00:31:45.25,00:31:45.25,AND TO BE HONEST I LIKE MY CHANCES WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS
649,00:31:48.83,00:31:48.83,BEEN THERE BEFORE A COUPLE TIMES BEFORE.
650,00:31:50.71,00:31:50.71,>> EXACTLY.
651,00:31:52.00,00:31:52.00,>> IF I DO BECOME A FOURTH...
652,00:31:53.21,00:31:53.21,">> YOU NEED TO REMEMBER, HE WILL TAKE US TO THE TOP."
653,00:31:57.75,00:31:57.75,AND THEN AFTER THAT...
654,00:31:59.08,00:31:59.08,">> IT MAKES SENSE. I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE."
655,00:32:01.08,00:32:01.08,>> IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
656,00:32:02.71,00:32:02.71,">> THIS IS A GAME TURNER RIGHT HERE, THIS VOTE."
657,00:32:06.96,00:32:06.96,"SO, IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE."
658,00:32:09.50,00:32:09.50,I HAVE THOUGHT IT OUT BOTH WAYS.
659,00:32:11.38,00:32:11.38,SHOULD I GO WITH RUSSELL?
660,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,SHOULD I TRUST HIM?
661,00:32:14.29,00:32:14.29,BECAUSE I KNOW HOW GOOD HE IS.
662,00:32:16.17,00:32:16.17,>> SHE'S ON OUR SIDE.
663,00:32:17.29,00:32:17.29,">> OKAY. NOW, I'M GOING TO TALK TO HER."
664,00:32:19.12,00:32:19.12,>> OKAY. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST BLINDSIDE EVER.
665,00:32:26.08,00:32:26.08,">> IF YOU-- IF YOU DO THIS, IF THIS GOES THE WAY IT GOES, I GOT"
666,00:32:29.96,00:32:29.96,YOUR ( NO AUDIO ) BACK.
667,00:32:31.25,00:32:31.25,">> OKAY, I TRUST YOU, DUDE."
668,00:32:32.33,00:32:32.33,>> LET'S DO IT.
669,00:32:34.04,00:32:34.04,RALPH.
670,00:32:36.46,00:32:36.46,LET'S GET RID OF RALPH.
671,00:32:39.42,00:32:39.42,"I'M TELLING YOU, YOU DO THIS WITH ME, I GOT YOU."
672,00:32:41.75,00:32:41.75,>> ALL RIGHT.
673,00:32:46.75,00:32:46.75,">> IF THIS HAPPENS, GAME ON."
674,00:32:49.71,00:32:49.71,"THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST MOVE,"
675,00:32:52.12,00:32:52.12,BIGGER THAN ANY MOVE I'VE EVER MADE.
676,00:32:53.62,00:32:53.62,THIS WILL BE A SHOCKER.
677,00:32:55.12,00:32:55.12,THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT RIGHT THERE.
678,00:32:57.75,00:32:57.75,"""KEEP HOPE ALIVE"" BABY."
679,00:32:59.46,00:32:59.46,THIS AIN'T OVER TILL IT'S OVER.
680,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS A TORCH.
681,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,GO AHEAD AND GRAB A TORCH AND APPROACH THE FLAME.
682,00:33:24.92,00:33:24.92,DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
683,00:33:28.54,00:33:28.54,THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL OF TRIBAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IN THIS
684,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,"GAME, FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE."
685,00:33:34.42,00:33:34.42,"WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE YOU."
686,00:33:36.46,00:33:36.46,WITH A SLIGHT EXCEPTION THIS SEASON: REDEMPTION ISLAND.
687,00:33:41.42,00:33:41.42,"SO, RALPH, FIRST TIME TRIBAL COUNCIL."
688,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,">> WELL, IT'S GOOD AND IT'S BAD."
689,00:33:47.79,00:33:47.79,>> Jeff: WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT COMING TO TRIBAL?
690,00:33:49.83,00:33:49.83,">> WELL, I WAS TOLD WE HAD TWO PARTS IN OUR GAME."
691,00:33:54.29,00:33:54.29,>> Jeff: I'M LOST. TWO PARTS?
692,00:33:56.54,00:33:56.54,>> WE'VE GOT TWO TEAMS IN THE SAME TEAM.
693,00:33:59.25,00:33:59.25,>> Jeff: YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A DIVISION WITHIN THE TRIBE.
694,00:34:01.46,00:34:01.46,">> YES, A DIVISION."
695,00:34:03.08,00:34:03.08,">> Jeff: STEVE, WAS IT QUICKLY"
696,00:34:05.04,00:34:05.04,APPARENT WHO WAS JELLING WITH WHO?
697,00:34:06.42,00:34:06.42,">> YES, IT WAS, JEFF."
698,00:34:08.00,00:34:08.00,"THERE ARE SIX OF US THAT ARE PRETTY ROCK SOLID, AND THEN"
699,00:34:10.54,00:34:10.54,THERE'S ANOTHER THREE LED BY RUSSELL.
700,00:34:13.62,00:34:13.62,">> Jeff: SERITA, WHAT CAUSED THE DIVISION WITHIN THIS TRIBE?"
701,00:34:16.92,00:34:16.92,">> I THINK IT WAS A LOT TO DO WITH RUSSELL AND HIS LEGACY, AND"
702,00:34:21.54,00:34:21.54,RUSSELL HAD GIVEN THIS GREAT SPEECH ABOUT HOW HE WAS GOING TO
703,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,PLAY DIFFERENTLY AND THAT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE CASE SO THERE
704,00:34:27.50,00:34:27.50,WAS A HUGE FISSURE IN THE TRIBE.
705,00:34:30.17,00:34:30.17,>> Jeff: RUSSELL YOU HAD TO KNOW
706,00:34:31.79,00:34:31.79,YOU WERE COMING IN HERE WITH A TARGET?
707,00:34:33.58,00:34:33.58,">> JEFF, THE PROBLEM WITH ME COMING HERE EVERYBODY PERCEIVES"
708,00:34:36.21,00:34:36.21,"ME AS THAT LEGACY WHERE I WOULD TRY TO LOSE BY BURNING SOCKS,"
709,00:34:42.04,00:34:42.04,POURING OUT WATER.
710,00:34:43.21,00:34:43.21,I AM NOT PLAYING THAT GAME.
711,00:34:44.96,00:34:44.96,"I CAME IN TO WIN CHALLENGES, NOT TO LOSE CHALLENGES."
712,00:34:49.04,00:34:49.04,"AND, YOU KNOW, FROM WHERE I STOOD, IT FELT TO ME THAT A LOT"
713,00:34:52.17,00:34:52.17,OF PEOPLE GAVE UP IN THE CHALLENGE.
714,00:34:53.46,00:34:53.46,>> Jeff: TODAY?
715,00:34:54.62,00:34:54.62,>> IT FELT THAT THEY THREW THE CHALLENGE.
716,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,">> Jeff: MIKE, BIG ACCUSATION."
717,00:35:02.21,00:35:02.21,>> PRETTY BIG.
718,00:35:03.50,00:35:03.50,"YOU KNOW, TODAY I WOULD SAY WE DIDN'T GO 100%."
719,00:35:06.88,00:35:06.88,"WE DEFINITELY WANTED TO WIN, BUT IF WE LOST, WE GOT SOME FAT ON"
720,00:35:11.29,00:35:11.29,THIS TRIBE WE NEED TO TRIM OFF.
721,00:35:13.92,00:35:13.92,">> Jeff: JULIE, HARD TO CONSIDER GETTING RID OF SOMEBODY WHEN YOU"
722,00:35:16.92,00:35:16.92,"KNOW THAT IT IS ABOUT NUMBERS, QUITE OFTEN?"

726,00:35:27.42,00:35:27.42,GO INTO THE MERGE WITH NUMBERS.

728,00:35:32.58,00:35:32.58,">> WELL, I THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE TRIBE FORGET THAT THEY'RE IN"

730,00:35:38.42,00:35:38.42,THIS IS RUSSELL.
731,00:35:39.83,00:35:39.83,HE'S PLAYED THE GAME.
732,00:35:41.83,00:35:41.83,HE WOULD BE A HUGE PART OF MOVING FORWARD.
733,00:35:44.96,00:35:44.96,HE'S DONE IT TWICE.
734,00:35:46.79,00:35:46.79,"ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THERE'S GOING TO BE BACKSTABBING MADE,"
735,00:35:49.62,00:35:49.62,SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO BECOME

737,00:35:53.29,00:35:53.29,"BUT YOUR BEST FRIEND TO THE LEFT OF YOU, TO THE RIGHT OF YOU, IS"
738,00:35:55.96,00:35:55.96,GOING TO TURN AROUND AND STAB YOU IN THE BACK BECAUSE YOU
739,00:35:57.92,00:35:57.92,DON'T HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS.
740,00:35:59.21,00:35:59.21,>> WHAT SHE DOESN'T REALIZE IS...

744,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,"WE WERE TWO PEOPLE ABOVE THEM, GUYS."
745,00:36:13.04,00:36:13.04,SO THROWING TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS NOT STRATEGY.
746,00:36:16.79,00:36:16.79,IT'S PLAIN STUPIDITY.
747,00:36:19.88,00:36:19.88,THAT'S ALL.

751,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,THAT'S THE POINT STEPHANIE'S MAKING.
752,00:36:32.38,00:36:32.38,>> IT STUNK NOT WINNING TODAY.

763,00:36:56.08,00:36:56.08,I TAKE A LITTLE EXCEPTION TO ALL THIS.

765,00:37:00.12,00:37:00.12,ISN'T WORKING.
