384,00:24:19.13,00:24:19.13,MAKING IT TOUGHER TO BALANCE. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE MORE
385,00:24:29.30,00:24:29.30,CONTAKE A RECOVERY WOO DOING A NICE JOB BUT HE CAN'T
386,00:24:41.60,00:24:41.60,"HANG IN THERE. WOO FALLS OFF, AND WE ARE DOWN"
387,00:24:44.43,00:24:44.43,"TO TWO. ONCE AGAIN, TASHA AND SPENCER."
388,00:24:48.47,00:24:48.47,WE'VE SEEN THIS SHOWDOWN BEFORE. WHEN SPENCER PULLED IT OUT.
389,00:24:55.03,00:24:55.03,THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT NOW. WE JUST GO UNTIL ONE OF YOU
390,00:24:58.87,00:24:58.87,FALLS OUT. TASHA WITH A NICE RECOVERY.

393,00:25:17.57,00:25:17.57,SPENCER WITH A NICE RECOVERY BUT HE CAN'T DO IT.

397,00:25:34.30,00:25:34.30,"( APPLAUSE ) TASHA, ONCE AGAIN, SAFE TONIGHT"
398,00:25:40.97,00:25:40.97,"AT TRIBAL COUNCIL. AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, AFTER 28"
399,00:25:44.77,00:25:44.77,"VERY DIFFICULT DAYS, SOMEBODY'S DREAM OF FINISHING THIS GAME AND"
400,00:25:48.70,00:25:48.70,WINNING THE MILLION DOLLARS WILL COME TO AN END.
401,00:25:51.60,00:25:51.60,GRAB YOUR STUFF. HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
402,00:25:53.20,00:25:53.20,SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL. CONGRATS.
403,00:25:55.80,00:25:55.80,">> THANKS, JEFF. >> I DON'T FEEL SAFE WITH TONY."
404,00:25:58.37,00:25:58.37,THE REST OF THE ALLIANCE BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE MAN SAYS LIKE
405,00:26:00.40,00:26:00.40,"HE'S JESUS OR SOMETHING. I'M MORE TRUSTING OF JOSH,"
406,00:26:04.10,00:26:04.10,JEREMIAH AND SPENCER AT THIS POINT.
407,00:26:05.73,00:26:05.73,AND IT COULD BE MY OPPORTUNITY TO GET RID OF TONY NOW THAN
408,00:26:10.90,00:26:10.90,GETTING RID OF TONY LATER. THAT WAS GOOD MAN.
409,00:26:33.00,00:26:33.00,THAT THIRD LEVEL I WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT ALONG.
410,00:26:35.63,00:26:35.63,ME NEITHER. AS OF NOW THE PLAN IS FOR
411,00:26:38.00,00:26:38.00,"SPENCER, JERIMIAH, MYSELF AND JEFFRA TO BLIND SIDE TONY."
412,00:26:43.00,00:26:43.00,THE PROBLEM IS IT CAN BE 4 AND4 AND WE MAY HAVE TO DO A REVOTE
413,00:26:49.00,00:26:49.00,AND GO TO ROCKS BUT WE FEEL THE MOST IMPORTANT
414,00:26:52.00,00:26:52.00,PERSON TO VOTE OUT IS TONY WOOD.
415,00:27:04.43,00:27:04.43,I'M NOT MAKING A FIRE. I'M NOT BOILING WATER.
416,00:27:06.40,00:27:06.40,I'M ON A MISSION. I NEED AN IMMUNITY IDOL.
417,00:27:11.63,00:27:11.63,"IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING ICONIC, SOME LANDMARK."
418,00:27:15.10,00:27:15.10,SO I FIGURED THERE'S A CRAZY-LOOKING TREE BEHIND TREE
419,00:27:19.03,00:27:19.03,MAIL. I CHECKED THAT WHEN I FIRST CAME
420,00:27:20.90,00:27:20.90,HERE. I'M GOING TO CHECK THAT AGAIN.
421,00:27:22.27,00:27:22.27,I'M LOOKING FOR THAT SPECIAL IDOL.
422,00:27:24.43,00:27:24.43,AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO FIND IT.
423,00:27:26.00,00:27:26.00,">> PLEASE, MAN. PLEASE BE HERE."
424,00:27:32.57,00:27:32.57,>> YOU'RE REALLY UPSET. I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR FACE.
425,00:27:35.13,00:27:35.13,">> I MEAN, I KNOW THAT YOU AND TONY ARE REALLY CLOSE, BUT I"
426,00:27:38.20,00:27:38.20,JUST DON'T FEEL SAFE IN OUR ALLIANCE.
427,00:27:40.90,00:27:40.90,">> WE GET BACK TO CAMP, AND I NOTICED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH"
428,00:27:43.80,00:27:43.80,JEFRA. SHE-- SHE WEARS HER HEART ON HER
429,00:27:46.30,00:27:46.30,"SLEEVE, AND SHE WAS LIKE-- ALMOST LOOKING LIKE SHE WAS ON"
430,00:27:49.13,00:27:49.13,THE VERGE OF TEARS. SHE'S FEELING THAT SHE'S AT THE
431,00:27:51.47,00:27:51.47,BOTTOM OF THE ALLIANCE AND SHE FEELS SHE CAN'T TRUST TONY.
432,00:27:54.00,00:27:54.00,>> HE WANTS TO PREVENT HE'S PLAYING BOTH SIDES BUT I'M OVER
433,00:27:56.80,00:27:56.80,HIS FAKENESS. I'M OVER HIS LIES ABOUT L.J.
434,00:27:59.50,00:27:59.50,"LIKE, IT'S JUST-- HE'S GETTING ON MY FREAKING NERVES."
435,00:28:06.57,00:28:06.57,">> SO, I WENT TO THE CRAZY LOOKING TREE BY TREE MAIL."
436,00:28:10.77,00:28:10.77,"NOTHING IS THERE. I SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT, LET ME"
437,00:28:12.70,00:28:12.70,JUST WALK THE PATH IN CASE SOMETHING POPS OUT.
438,00:28:16.33,00:28:16.33,THIS LOOKS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. I RUP INTO A TREE.
439,00:28:19.40,00:28:19.40,IT LOOKED LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. IT HAD THESE BIG ROOTS.
440,00:28:22.13,00:28:22.13,I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
441,00:28:24.13,00:28:24.13,I SAID I HAVE TO START LOOKING HERE.
442,00:28:36.43,00:28:36.43,SO I START DIGGING. I START SCRATCHING.
443,00:28:39.17,00:28:39.17,... AND THEN I FELT SOMETHING. SO I TOOK A PIECE OF STICK AND I
444,00:28:44.40,00:28:44.40,"START DIGGING, I START DIGGING, I START DIGGING."
445,00:28:52.07,00:28:52.07,"I SAID OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, LET THIS BE IT!"
446,00:28:56.17,00:28:56.17,"OH, MY GOSH! I ALMOST PASSED OUT."
447,00:29:01.00,00:29:01.00,"I WAS JUST SO HAPPY. AND THEN WHEN I OPENED IT, IT'S"
448,00:29:04.23,00:29:04.23,A SPECIAL IDOL. OH!
449,00:29:07.13,00:29:07.13,"OH, MY GOD! WOW!"
450,00:29:11.70,00:29:11.70,"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MAN. THIS SPECIAL IDOL THAT I FOUND"
451,00:29:16.37,00:29:16.37,TODAY IS PRYLESS. THIS HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL UPON
452,00:29:19.13,00:29:19.13,KEEP YOU SAFE FROM BEING VOTED OUT AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.
453,00:29:22.93,00:29:22.93,UNLIKE OTHER HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOLS THIS IDOL CAN BE PLAYED
454,00:29:26.77,00:29:26.77,AFTER THE VOTES ARE READ. AFTER YOU SEE THE VOTES YOU
455,00:29:29.00,00:29:29.00,CANNIZE IT? EVERYBODY'S EYES SAY BING.
456,00:29:32.87,00:29:32.87,THIS ONLY PROTECTS THE PERSON WHO FIND IT.
457,00:29:34.90,00:29:34.90,YOU MAY NOT GIVE THIS IMMUNITY IDOL TO ANOTHER TRIBE MEMBER.
458,00:29:39.17,00:29:39.17,I GOTTA GO WASH UP. I GOTTA GO WASH UP.
459,00:29:42.43,00:29:42.43,I GOTTA GO WASH UP. YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL THAT IS?
460,00:29:45.77,00:29:45.77,I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW POWERFUL THAT IS.
461,00:29:52.33,00:29:52.33,>> YOU KNOW WHAT? WHENEVER YOU GET RID OF SOMEONE
462,00:29:54.43,00:29:54.43,"IN THIS GAME THAT IS ANNOYING YOU, YOU SCREW YOURSELF."
463,00:29:58.13,00:29:58.13,>> YEAH. BUT LIKE I JUST CAN'T EVEN STAND
464,00:30:01.13,00:30:01.13,HIM. >> THAT'S HOW EVERYONE FEELS
465,00:30:03.17,00:30:03.17,THOUGH. THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM.
466,00:30:04.67,00:30:04.67,>> SO THIS IS THE DEAL. WE CAN'T GET RID OF HIM TONIGHT.
467,00:30:07.20,00:30:07.20,IF WE GET RID AM HUFF TONIGHT WE GIVE THOSE THREE MORE POWER AND
468,00:30:10.97,00:30:10.97,WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT THEM IN THE
469,00:30:13.87,00:30:13.87,END. ZIMUCH BETTER SHOT OF BEATING
470,00:30:17.83,00:30:17.83,"TONY. TONY, WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO"
471,00:30:19.00,00:30:19.00,"TRUST YOU. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRUST YOU,"
472,00:30:21.17,00:30:21.17,"BECAUSE OTHERWISE-- >> DON'T INSULT ME, TRISH."
473,00:30:23.17,00:30:23.17,">> I KNOW, I'M JUST SAYING-- >> DON'T INSULT ME, FIRST LADY."
474,00:30:26.53,00:30:26.53,>> EVERYBODY IS PARANOID YOU'RE PLAYING DOUBLE AGENT.
475,00:30:28.77,00:30:28.77,">> WHO IS, WHO IS, WHO IS? >> EVERYBODY IS."
476,00:30:31.37,00:30:31.37,>> THE WHOWBL DOUBLE AGENT THING.
477,00:30:34.43,00:30:34.43,">> IT MAKES EVERYBODY PARANOID. >> I UNDERSTAND THAT, TRISH, BUT"
478,00:30:36.53,00:30:36.53,"IF YOU GUYS KNOW WHO I AM AND YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT, IF"
479,00:30:39.13,00:30:39.13,"YOU GUYS KNOW I GAVE YOU GUYS MY WORD-- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,"
480,00:30:43.10,00:30:43.10,FIVE. ALL THREE OF THEM ARE GONE.
481,00:30:45.13,00:30:45.13,THAT I'M GUARANTEEING YOU. >> I WAS QUESTIONING TONIGHT'S
482,00:30:52.27,00:30:52.27,"INTEGRITY, AND HE ADMITTED THE DOUBLE AGENT ISN'T GOING TO WORK"
483,00:30:55.83,00:30:55.83,"AND JEFRA NEEDED TO HEAR THAT I WAS CALLING HIM OUT, AND THAT'S"
484,00:30:59.03,00:30:59.03,WHY I DID WHAT I DID. BUT I THINK SHE'S PRETTY LOYAL.
485,00:31:02.20,00:31:02.20,I DON'T THINK SHE'LL FLIP. >> I THINK SPENCER HAS THE IDOL.
486,00:31:06.90,00:31:06.90,>> I'M TELLING YOU. I KNOW HOW TO READ PEOPLE.
487,00:31:10.33,00:31:10.33,"WOO, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? >> IF SPENCER HAS AN IDOL, THEN"
488,00:31:14.70,00:31:14.70,"WE'RE SCREWED. YOU KNOW, TASHA'S SAFE TONIGHT"
489,00:31:17.83,00:31:17.83,"SO FOR TO US GET RID OF SPENCER WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER,"
490,00:31:21.20,00:31:21.20,"CONSIDERING HE'S GOOD WITH THE JURY, PLUS HE IS VERY CAPABLE OF"
491,00:31:26.53,00:31:26.53,"WINNING IMMUNITY CHALLENGES. JEREMIAH, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS"
492,00:31:28.77,00:31:28.77,ONE OF THOSE ATHLETES THAT THREATS OUR CHANCES AS WELL.
493,00:31:32.43,00:31:32.43,"BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE DON'T HAVE 100% CERTAINTY ON,"
494,00:31:35.67,00:31:35.67,AND THAT'S WHO HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
495,00:31:41.77,00:31:41.77,">> JEREMIAH, I CAN TALK TO YOU JUST FOR ONE SECOND?"
496,00:31:44.47,00:31:44.47,"I KNOW THAT I MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU THE OTHER DAY, BUT I'M"
497,00:31:48.87,00:31:48.87,"NOT GOING TO BE VOTING WITH YOU. >> OKAY, THAT'S FINE."
498,00:31:51.30,00:31:51.30,>> I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND. IT'S JUST FOR MY BEST INTEREST
499,00:31:53.73,00:31:53.73,IN THE GAME. >> THAT'S OKAY.
500,00:31:54.83,00:31:54.83,>> IT'S NOTHING AGAINST YOU PERFECTLY.
501,00:31:56.80,00:31:56.80,">> I SEE JEFRA WITH HER OLD ALLIANCE, EVERYBODY BUT ME,"
502,00:32:00.40,00:32:00.40,"SPENCER, AND TASH, AND I JUST KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP."
503,00:32:03.63,00:32:03.63,>> THAT'S FINE. >> SORRY.
504,00:32:05.53,00:32:05.53,>> I DIDN'T PUT A LITTLE BIT OF TRUST IN HER.
505,00:32:08.77,00:32:08.77,SHE SHOOK MY HAND. SHE PROMISED US AND ALL THAT AND
506,00:32:11.83,00:32:11.83,I I GUESS I GOT THE BETTER OF HER.
507,00:32:25.43,00:32:25.43,>> NO WONDER YOU'RE SO FREAKING HOT!
508,00:32:28.40,00:32:28.40,>> SO JEREMIAH REALIZES THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT ONE OF
509,00:32:31.67,00:32:31.67,US IS GOING HOME TONIGHT. SO HE DECIDED TO LET THE CAT OUT
510,00:32:34.73,00:32:34.73,OF THE BAG AND SAY THAT HE'S A FASHION MODEL.
511,00:32:44.00,00:32:44.00,>> HE'S A HOT MODEL. >> IT DOESN'T SURPRISE THEE MEE
512,00:32:47.63,00:32:47.63,"THAT JEREMIAH THINKS HIM BEING A FASHION MOD CELL THIS BIG-DEAL,"
513,00:32:51.70,00:32:51.70,TOP-SECRET THING THAT HE CAN'T TELL PEOPLE.
514,00:32:53.40,00:32:53.40,THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM THE BEAUTY TRIBE.
515,00:32:55.03,00:32:55.03,SO I DECIDED TO RETURN THE FAVOR.
516,00:32:57.97,00:32:57.97,">> I GOT ONE THING I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TOO."
517,00:33:00.07,00:33:00.07,>> YEAH. >> ALL RIGHT.
518,00:33:02.27,00:33:02.27,SO -- >> YOU GOT THE IDOL.

520,00:33:06.93,00:33:06.93,>> DO YOU REALLY? >> I FOUND IT ABOUT A WEEK AGO.
521,00:33:09.57,00:33:09.57,>> YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH. >> I TOLD TASHA AND JEREMIAH

525,00:33:20.37,00:33:20.37,>> SO WHO DO WE VOTE TONIGHT? >> WOO.
526,00:33:23.07,00:33:23.07,>> WHY WOO INSTEAD OF TONY? >> I THINK JUST BECAUSE HE'S THE
527,00:33:27.33,00:33:27.33,BIGGEST PHYSICAL CHALLENGE. >> OKAY.
528,00:33:31.53,00:33:31.53,>> I CAN PLAY THIS THING FOR ME. I CAN PLAY IT FOR JEREMIAH.
529,00:33:35.13,00:33:35.13,"I COULD KEEP IT. BUT IF I USE IT WRONG, I COULD"
530,00:33:37.73,00:33:37.73,BE KICKING MYSELF FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
531,00:33:57.20,00:33:57.20,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN THE MEMBERS OF OUR JURY.

534,00:34:13.43,00:34:13.43,"SO, SPENCER, LAST TRIBAL, IT LOOKED LIKE YOU, TASHA, AND"
535,00:34:16.97,00:34:16.97,"JEREMIAH WERE IN TROUBLE, AND THEN L.J.'S BLINDSIDED."
536,00:34:19.73,00:34:19.73,"SO THE QUESTION IS, IS THE GAME UP FOR GRABS NOW?"
537,00:34:22.87,00:34:22.87,>> THE GAME WAS UP FOR GRABS FOR A WHILE.
538,00:34:25.17,00:34:25.17,"BUT THE THREE OF US KNOW WHERE WE STAND, WHICH IS ON THE"
539,00:34:30.20,00:34:30.20,"OUTSIDE. >> Jeff: JEREMIAH, YOU CONCUR"
