138,00:04:14.27,00:04:14.27,I JUST THINK IT'S HILARIOUS AT
139,00:04:17.13,00:04:17.13,THE BEGINNING IT WAS US
140,00:04:18.80,00:04:18.80,STRUGGLING AND NOW THE BOYS COME
141,00:04:20.13,00:04:20.13,BY WANTING EVERYTHING WE WIN IN
142,00:04:22.30,00:04:22.30,CHALLENGES.
143,00:04:22.60,00:04:22.60,IT'S JUST CRAZY HOW MUCH THE
144,00:04:24.47,00:04:24.47,ROLES HAVE REVERSED IN NINE
145,00:04:27.20,00:04:27.20,DAYS.
146,00:04:27.60,00:04:27.60,I KNOW I PROBABLY SOUND LIKE

150,00:04:32.73,00:04:32.73,"IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT,"
151,00:04:34.40,00:04:34.40,WE'RE FINE WITH THAT.

153,00:04:37.50,00:04:37.50,IS.
154,00:04:37.97,00:04:37.97,BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR
155,00:04:38.77,00:04:38.77,BOTH OF US.
156,00:04:39.73,00:04:39.73,"THINK ABOUT IT, WE'RE DOING ALL"
157,00:04:41.07,00:04:41.07,THE WORK AND YOU'RE GETTING HALF

159,00:04:43.10,00:04:43.10,I DON'T REALLY CARE EITHER WAY.
160,00:04:44.73,00:04:44.73,YOU DON'T CARE EITHER WAY?
161,00:04:46.37,00:04:46.37,I THINK JONAS IS A REAL RUDE
162,00:04:48.20,00:04:48.20,DUDE.
163,00:04:48.63,00:04:48.63,HE MADE THE OFFER WITH THE NET
164,00:04:49.73,00:04:49.73,"AND THEN KEPT SAYING ""I MEAN, I"
165,00:04:51.60,00:04:51.60,DON'T CARE.
166,00:04:52.20,00:04:52.20,I DON'T CARE.

168,00:04:54.03,00:04:54.03,BUT OBVIOUSLY HE CARES A LOT.
169,00:04:54.97,00:04:54.97,IT WOULD JUST BE A LOT EASIER
170,00:04:56.93,00:04:56.93,FOR BOTH OF US.
171,00:04:58.13,00:04:58.13,YOU GUYS CAN THINK ABOUT THAT
172,00:04:59.13,00:04:59.13,AND GET BACK TO US.
173,00:04:59.97,00:04:59.97,"THE WOMEN, THEY'RE TRYING TO"
174,00:05:01.80,00:05:01.80,"BE SUCH HARD-NOSES, I DON'T GET"
175,00:05:03.87,00:05:03.87,THAT.
176,00:05:04.30,00:05:04.30,I DON'T KNOW IF THEIR EMOTIONS

178,00:05:07.00,00:05:07.00,BUT THEY'RE EMOTIONAL CREATURES
179,00:05:08.63,00:05:08.63,AND THEY CAN'T SEEM TO THINK
180,00:05:09.90,00:05:09.90,STRAIGHT.
181,00:05:10.17,00:05:10.17,DON'T THINK I'M A BITCH!
182,00:05:12.27,00:05:12.27,"WELL, YOU JUST MADE A BITCH"
183,00:05:14.03,00:05:14.03,MOVE.

185,00:05:16.50,00:05:16.50,THEY CAN SUN TAN ON THE BEACH
186,00:05:17.60,00:05:17.60,WHILE WE GO FISH AND BRING THEM
187,00:05:19.07,00:05:19.07,HALF OF THE FOOD.
