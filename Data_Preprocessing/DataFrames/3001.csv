387,00:25:32.33,00:25:32.33,NO COLLAR JUST GETTING READY TO SHOOT.
388,00:25:34.17,00:25:34.17,"JOE IS BACK. LET'S GO, NO COLLAR."

398,00:26:10.87,00:26:10.87,COLLAR. NO COLLAR SIMPLY CANNOT GET A

400,00:26:18.97,00:26:18.97,JOAQUIN WINS IT FOR THE WHITE COLLAR TRIBE.
401,00:26:21.80,00:26:21.80,WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE MORE. IT IS NOW BLUE COLLAR AND NO

403,00:26:27.93,00:26:27.93,NO COLLAR STARTING TO PANIC NOW. NO COLLAR CAN'T GET ANYTHING
404,00:26:32.97,00:26:32.97,GOING. SIERRA CAN WIN IT RIGHT HERE.
405,00:26:36.70,00:26:36.70,SHE DOES! BLUE COLLAR WINS IMMUNITY AND
406,00:26:41.43,00:26:41.43,REWARD SENDING NO COLLAR TO TRIBAL COUNCIL.

422,00:27:59.73,00:27:59.73,WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. >> SO THE CHALLENGE BLEW UP
423,00:28:07.03,00:28:07.03,"MAJOR, AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TRIBAL."
424,00:28:09.73,00:28:09.73,AND THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THIS IS THE

434,00:29:00.17,00:29:00.17,IS JOE. THERE'S ONE CHANCE TO TAKE JOE

436,00:29:05.23,00:29:05.23,"SURE IF WE COULD WIN CHALLENGES. >> WELL, I KNOW WILL'S NOT"

440,00:29:20.93,00:29:20.93,"COULD GET VOTED OUT FIRST BECAUSE AFTER MY BLOW-UP, I KNOW"
441,00:29:24.40,00:29:24.40,THEY WANT ME OUT. SO I'M VERY NERVOUS.
442,00:29:28.30,00:29:28.30,>> WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WIN SOME CHALLENGES.
443,00:29:33.47,00:29:33.47,IT DEPENDS ON IF WILL CAN COME BACK AROUND.
444,00:29:36.33,00:29:36.33,>> LET ME TALK TO HIM AND SEE HUH HE'S FEELING.
445,00:29:41.00,00:29:41.00,>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO?

450,00:30:04.70,00:30:04.70,"NERVOUS ABOUT NINA. IF I WAS HER, I WOULD BE"
451,00:30:11.13,00:30:11.13,LOOKING. >> SO IS SHE GOING TO BE FIRST?

453,00:30:15.73,00:30:15.73,"AND VOTE HER OFF. AT THIS POINT IT SUCKS, BUT NINA"
454,00:30:20.50,00:30:20.50,IS THE WEAKEST LINK. SHE'S 54 YEARS OLD AND HER
455,00:30:23.63,00:30:23.63,HEARING ALSO DOESN'T HELP. SHE'S ON THE BOTTOM.
456,00:30:25.47,00:30:25.47,"YOU KNOW, SHE KNOWS IT. SO SHE'S PROBABLY LOOKING FOR"
457,00:30:28.80,00:30:28.80,THE IDOL. SO WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

464,00:30:51.53,00:30:51.53,I HAVE MY DOUBTS JUST BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH TIME HE'S BEEN SPENDING
465,00:30:54.90,00:30:54.90,WITH NINA. BUT YOU HAVE TO TRUST PEOPLE IN

474,00:31:28.40,00:31:28.40,"ONE OF THEM THREE, WE CONTROL THE TRIBE."

485,00:32:06.90,00:32:06.90,>> THE THING IS THIS: I DON'T TRUST JENN AT ALL.
486,00:32:11.23,00:32:11.23,>> YEAH. >> AT ALL.
487,00:32:13.40,00:32:13.40,ZERO. >> SHE DEFINITELY WANTS YOU

542,00:35:43.43,00:35:43.43,"COULD ARGUE, GUYS, WE GOT TO HELP NINA OUT."
543,00:35:45.87,00:35:45.87,"SHE CAN'T HEAR THE SAME WAY WE CAN, SO WE HAVE TO MAKE AN"
544,00:35:49.07,00:35:49.07,"EFFORT. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU CAN SAY,"
545,00:35:50.80,00:35:50.80,EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING. WHERE DO YOU FALL ON THAT?
546,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17,">> YOU KNOW, I HAVE NEVER BEEN AROUND SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE"
547,00:35:56.13,00:35:56.13,"THAT GREAT OF HEARING BEFORE, SO I HAVE COMPASSION, HOWEVER, THIS"
548,00:35:59.90,00:35:59.90,"IS A GAME, AND I THINK PEOPLE JUST, YOU KNOW, KIND OF DEAL"
549,00:36:03.80,00:36:03.80,"WITH IT. >> Jeff: SO, VINCE, IF THERE"
550,00:36:08.90,00:36:08.90,IS A TIGHT THREE BASED ON AGE AND COMMON INTEREST AND A TIGHT
551,00:36:13.97,00:36:13.97,"TWO ON THE SAME THING, WHERE ARE YOU?"
552,00:36:15.67,00:36:15.67,>> I GUESS IN THE MIDDLE. I LIKE COHESION.
553,00:36:18.83,00:36:18.83,THAT'S THE TRUEST NATURE OF MYSELF.
554,00:36:20.87,00:36:20.87,"I'M TRYING TO BE THE GLUE, THE COHESIVE BOND TO KEEP IT ALL"
555,00:36:25.30,00:36:25.30,"TOGETHER. >> Jeff: JOE, IF VINCE IS IN"
556,00:36:28.97,00:36:28.97,"THE MIDDLE, THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING SITUATION, BECAUSE"
557,00:36:31.27,00:36:31.27,IF VINCE FEELS THIS THREE IS TOO TIGHT FOR ME AND I DON'T WANT TO
558,00:36:34.33,00:36:34.33,"BE NUMBER FOUR, HE GOES WITH NINA AND WILL AND NOW WE HAVE A"
559,00:36:37.87,00:36:37.87,TRUE SHOWDOWN FOR THE POWER IN THIS TRIBE.
560,00:36:39.37,00:36:39.37,">> OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE BEEN FEELING EACH OTHER"
561,00:36:42.33,00:36:42.33,"OUT, AND I THINK HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO LAND RIGHT WHERE HE"
562,00:36:45.90,00:36:45.90,NEEDS TO. I THINK TONIGHT THE PERSON WHO
563,00:36:48.87,00:36:48.87,"NEEDS TO GO HOME WILL GO HOME. >> Jeff: JENN, IS IT A SAFE"
564,00:36:54.53,00:36:54.53,"ASSUMPTION TO THINK THAT YOU, JOE AND HALEY ARE TOGETHER BASED"
565,00:36:57.17,00:36:57.17,"ON WHAT I'VE HEARD? >> OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE DUMB"
566,00:36:59.90,00:36:59.90,"TO BE LIKE, OH, NO, THEY JUST TALK SOMETIMES."
567,00:37:02.70,00:37:02.70,NO ONE PLAYING THIS GAME IS STUPID.
568,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,I DON'T THINK. BUT OUR MAIN THING IS WE NEED TO
569,00:37:08.80,00:37:08.80,"KEEP THE NUMBERS UP. YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T KEEP LOSING"
570,00:37:11.27,00:37:11.27,"AND LOSING AND LOSING, AND OBVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE DON'T DO"
571,00:37:14.20,00:37:14.20,"AS WELL IN CHALLENGES AS OTHER PEOPLE DO, AND THAT'S A HUGE"
572,00:37:17.90,00:37:17.90,CONCERN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP OUR TRIBE STRONG.
573,00:37:21.77,00:37:21.77,">> Jeff: WILL, JENN SAYS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT AREN'T"
574,00:37:24.37,00:37:24.37,STRONG IN CHALLENGES. YOU HAD TO FEEL THE HAIR ON THE
575,00:37:26.50,00:37:26.50,BACK OF YOUR NECK GO UP A LITTLE BIT BASED ON TODAY.
576,00:37:29.87,00:37:29.87,">> OH, YEAH, WATER'S ALWAYS BEEN THE BLACK MAN'S KRYPTONITE."
577,00:37:33.80,00:37:33.80,IT GOT ME TODAY. I WAS THERE AT THE END OF THAT
578,00:37:36.37,00:37:36.37,BUOY AND I GOT CAUGHT UP. >> Jeff: WAS THERE ANY TIME
579,00:37:39.10,00:37:39.10,"TODAY WHERE YOU THOUGHT, MAN, I GOT TO GET NINA AND I GOT TO GET"
580,00:37:42.33,00:37:42.33,"TO VINCE AND SAY, LISTEN, WE NEED OUR OWN THREE."
581,00:37:44.40,00:37:44.40,>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT. THEY GOT THREE.
582,00:37:47.77,00:37:47.77,"WE GOT THREE, GET A SPLIT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS."
583,00:37:50.77,00:37:50.77,BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU CAN TRUST IN THIS GAME.
584,00:37:52.57,00:37:52.57,"YOU HAVE TO TRUST SOMEBODY, BUT IF YOU TRUST THE WRONG PERSON,"
585,00:37:55.03,00:37:55.03,"THE FLAME'S GONE. >> Jeff: VINCE, IT'S ONE THING"
586,00:37:58.17,00:37:58.17,TO WATCH FROM HOME. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO BE OUT
587,00:38:02.20,00:38:02.20,HERE IN THE MIDDLE WITH A VOTE COMING AND YOU DON'T KNOW IF
588,00:38:06.10,00:38:06.10,IT'S YOU. >> IT VERY WELL COULD BE.
589,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,>> Jeff: HOW DO YOU HANDLE ALL THE LAYERS OF THINKING THAT HAVE
590,00:38:11.47,00:38:11.47,TO BE HAPPENING TO STAY IN THIS GAME AT ALL TIMES?
591,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,">> JEFF, I'VE BEEN TRYING SO VERY HARD TO GO MORE SO WITH MY"
592,00:38:17.60,00:38:17.60,GUT THAN MY HEAD. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO
593,00:38:20.87,00:38:20.87,HAVE SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH A FEW PEOPLE THAT IF I WAS UNSURE
594,00:38:23.70,00:38:23.70,"ABOUT THEM BEFORE, I FEEL LIKE I'M QUITE SOLID NOW."
595,00:38:27.63,00:38:27.63,">> Jeff: JENN, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE THE SEE HAPPEN TONIGHT?"
596,00:38:29.93,00:38:29.93,>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT WE SET FORTH
597,00:38:33.77,00:38:33.77,"GO INTO MOTION. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN,"
598,00:38:36.07,00:38:36.07,"BUT I MEAN, I COULD BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TONIGHT."
599,00:38:38.97,00:38:38.97,I DON'T KNOW. THE WORST THING YOU CAN BE IN
600,00:38:40.97,00:38:40.97,THIS GAME IS COMFORTABLE. >> Jeff: SO YOU BRING UP
601,00:38:43.47,00:38:43.47,SOMETHING. EVEN THOUGH THE THREE OF YOU ARE
602,00:38:45.80,00:38:45.80,"TIGHT AND SEEM TO HAVE A GRASP ON WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TONIGHT,"
603,00:38:48.93,00:38:48.93,"YOU'RE RIGHT, IT COULD BE YOU. >> IT COULD, BUT IT'S FUN BEING"
604,00:38:52.17,00:38:52.17,HERE. IT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.
605,00:38:53.83,00:38:53.83,I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SINCE I WAS EIGHT.
606,00:38:56.20,00:38:56.20,I STILL FEEL LIKE I'M WATCHING YOU ON TELEVISION RIGHT NOW.
607,00:38:59.80,00:38:59.80,I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M HERE. I'M LOSING MY MIND.
608,00:39:02.40,00:39:02.40,"YOU HAVE NO IDEA. >> Jeff: WILL, IF YOU GET YOUR"
609,00:39:05.20,00:39:05.20,"WAY, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT?"
610,00:39:06.83,00:39:06.83,>> IF I GET MY WAY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT IS I'M GOING
611,00:39:10.43,00:39:10.43,"TO GO BACK TO THE TRIBE, DRINK SOME LUKEWARM WATER AND LET SOME"
612,00:39:15.00,00:39:15.00,BUGS EAT UP MORE OF THIS CHOCOLATE AND SEE LESS OF YOU.
613,00:39:18.00,00:39:18.00,I DON'T WANT THE SEE YOU UNTIL THE END.
614,00:39:20.27,00:39:20.27,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS"
615,00:39:22.10,00:39:22.10,GOING TO BE A VERY BIG VOTE VERY EARLY IN THE GAME.
616,00:39:25.50,00:39:25.50,"IT IS TIME TO VOTE. NINA, YOU'RE UP."
617,00:39:46.47,00:39:46.47,>> THIS IS NOTHING PERSONAL. THIS IS STRICTLY STRATEGIC.
618,00:39:55.93,00:39:55.93,">> NINA, YOU'RE JUST NOT THE STRONGEST PLAYER ON THE TRIBE."
619,00:40:14.17,00:40:14.17,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
620,00:40:21.47,00:40:21.47,"IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT TO PLAY IT,"
621,00:40:24.90,00:40:24.90,NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO. OKAY.
622,00:40:31.97,00:40:31.97,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
623,00:40:34.13,00:40:34.13,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA
624,00:40:38.13,00:40:38.13,IMMEDIATELY. I'LL READ THE VOTES.

636,00:41:52.97,00:41:52.97,GRAB YOUR TORCHES AND HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

645,00:42:38.73,00:42:38.73,>> THESE ARE SOME PLAYERS. THEY'RE PLAYERS.
646,00:42:41.70,00:42:41.70,"THEY MADE A GOOD MOVE BECAUSE I WAS GOING THE TAKE THEM ALL OUT,"
647,00:42:44.70,00:42:44.70,BUT THIS IS SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE GREATEST EXPERIENCES I'VE EVER
648,00:42:47.80,00:42:47.80,HAD. I ENJOY EXPERIENCING EVERY
649,00:42:50.40,00:42:50.40,"ELEMENT OF MYSELF, ASPECTS THAT ARE UNEXPRESSED AND UNEXPLORED."
650,00:42:54.83,00:42:54.83,AND THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC.
