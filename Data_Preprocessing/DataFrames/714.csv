2,00:00:07.13,00:00:07.13,Americans began the adventure of a lifetime.
3,00:00:10.23,00:00:10.23,"Wearing only their street clothes, they journeyed"
4,00:00:12.73,00:00:12.73,"south off the coast of Panama to the Pearl Islands,"
5,00:00:15.90,00:00:15.90,where they were met with a big surprise.
6,00:00:18.03,00:00:18.03,You're going into this game with the clothes you have
7,00:00:20.80,00:00:20.80,"on your back, just like if you"
8,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67,really were shipwrecked. They were given
9,00:00:30.53,00:00:30.53,100 Panamanian dollars and abandoned
10,00:00:33.33,00:00:33.33,"near a small fishing village, where they bargained"
11,00:00:35.70,00:00:35.70,for supplies. >> Rice? Rice?
12,00:00:37.70,00:00:37.70,>> Rice. >> PROBST: Right from the
13,00:00:39.57,00:00:39.57,"beginning, the Morgan Tribe was scattered and frantic."
14,00:00:42.73,00:00:42.73,>> Give me my money back. Money. I need my money back.
15,00:00:46.07,00:00:46.07,I don't want it. >> PROBST: While the Drake Tribe
16,00:00:48.33,00:00:48.33,pulled together and worked every advantage.
17,00:00:50.80,00:00:50.80,(speaking Spanish) >> Sandra was so amazing
18,00:00:54.70,00:00:54.70,"in the town, because she spoke the language."
19,00:00:58.33,00:00:58.33,>> Pirates steal. Pirates take advantage.
20,00:01:01.53,00:01:01.53,"All their trade goods, all the little women's shoes,"
21,00:01:04.50,00:01:04.50,"everything that I could find in theirs, I took."
22,00:01:09.07,00:01:09.07,">> PROBST: Once at camp, the Drakes continued to prosper,"
23,00:01:12.33,00:01:12.33,and Rupert emerged as their natural provider.
24,00:01:15.33,00:01:15.33,>> I got lunch! >> Yeah!
25,00:01:20.73,00:01:20.73,>> PROBST: The Morgan Tribe struggled and faced setback
26,00:01:23.17,00:01:23.17,"after setback. >> Oh, my God."
27,00:01:26.47,00:01:26.47,I just lost the hook. >> We are absolutely devastated.
28,00:01:30.17,00:01:30.17,I think it's us against everything else out here.
29,00:01:34.07,00:01:34.07,">> PROBST: In the first 11 days, the Drakes won six challenges"
30,00:01:37.70,00:01:37.70,in a row. Drake wins immunity!
31,00:01:40.23,00:01:40.23,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: And the already weak
32,00:01:42.37,00:01:42.37,Morgan Tribe lost three members. Morale at the Morgan camp
33,00:01:49.23,00:01:49.23,was so low that Osten contemplated quitting.
34,00:01:52.07,00:01:52.07,">> Vote me right off, 'cause I don't deserve to win."
35,00:01:54.60,00:01:54.60,">> PROBST: Eventually, disharmony set in at Drake as"
36,00:01:56.90,00:01:56.90,well and they deliberately threw a challenge
37,00:01:59.70,00:01:59.70,to get rid of one of their own. Morgan wins immunity!
38,00:02:02.97,00:02:02.97,But it was a decision that changed the game.
39,00:02:05.27,00:02:05.27,The defeat sent the Drakes into a tailspin
40,00:02:08.10,00:02:08.10,"and, over the next nine days, they lost three members,"
41,00:02:11.30,00:02:11.30,making the tribes even at five each.
42,00:02:14.63,00:02:14.63,"On day 19, both Drake and Morgan were blindsided by a twist."
43,00:02:20.47,00:02:20.47,Your past has come back to haunt you.
44,00:02:23.10,00:02:23.10,The six castaways who had been voted out
45,00:02:25.50,00:02:25.50,returned as a tribe of Outcasts to compete
46,00:02:27.87,00:02:27.87,against Drake and Morgan for a chance
47,00:02:30.43,00:02:30.43,"to return to the game. >> Revenge, baby."
48,00:02:33.27,00:02:33.27,All about revenge. >> PROBST: If you really are
49,00:02:36.73,00:02:36.73,"the ten most worthy Survivors, this should be no trouble."
50,00:02:40.77,00:02:40.77,Everybody's got to cross the finish line.
51,00:02:43.07,00:02:43.07,Got to have the tribe flag. (screaming and cheering)
52,00:02:45.93,00:02:45.93,The Outcasts defeat Morgan and Drake!
53,00:02:48.50,00:02:48.50,"The Outcasts beat both tribes, forcing Drake and Morgan"
54,00:02:52.20,00:02:52.20,to separate Tribal Councils. Shawn was voted
55,00:02:55.10,00:02:55.10,out of the Drake Tribe. And Osten became the first
56,00:03:00.27,00:03:00.27,"Survivor ever to quit the game. >> Yeah, I'm quitting."
57,00:03:03.40,00:03:03.40,My health to me is more important
58,00:03:05.70,00:03:05.70,"than a million dollars, I guess, right now."
59,00:03:07.30,00:03:07.30,">> PROBST: Osten, per your wishes..."
60,00:03:10.27,00:03:10.27,"go home. All due respect to Osten,"
61,00:03:18.37,00:03:18.37,people work too damn hard to get in this game
62,00:03:21.13,00:03:21.13,and fight to stay alive. If he wants to lay his torch
63,00:03:23.50,00:03:23.50,"down, so it shall be. The Outcasts voted"
64,00:03:28.03,00:03:28.03,Lill and Burton back in and they both returned
65,00:03:31.20,00:03:31.20,"to their former camps. On day 21, the game changed"
66,00:03:34.20,00:03:34.20,again when the two tribes merged.
67,00:03:37.47,00:03:37.47,They became the Balboas. >> Balboa!
68,00:03:40.70,00:03:40.70,>> Balboa! (cheering)
69,00:03:42.97,00:03:42.97,>> I knew that here is where the true game starts.
70,00:03:48.10,00:03:48.10,>> PROBST: Old alliances broke down when Lill jumped ship
71,00:03:50.83,00:03:50.83,"and helped vote out her former tribe mate, Andrew."
72,00:03:55.40,00:03:55.40,"Ryno was the next to go. >> I'll be back, guys."
73,00:04:03.23,00:04:03.23,> PROBST: Former Outcasts Lill and Burton made a pact to stay
74,00:04:06.70,00:04:06.70,together. >> To the Outcasts.
75,00:04:08.67,00:04:08.67,>> To the Outcasts. >> Taking it home.
76,00:04:10.53,00:04:10.53,">> Uh-huh. >> PROBST: And Rupert, Christa"
77,00:04:13.07,00:04:13.07,and Sandra continued their friendly bond.
78,00:04:15.77,00:04:15.77,">> They are so power-ridden, they know it."
79,00:04:19.00,00:04:19.00,">> PROBST: Uneasy with the power that Rupert seemed to have,"
80,00:04:21.73,00:04:21.73,Jon and Burton formed a tight alliance of two.
81,00:04:24.33,00:04:24.33,>> You and I will go all the way.
82,00:04:26.90,00:04:26.90,">>I know. >> PROBST: Together, they"
83,00:04:28.53,00:04:28.53,"launched a plot with Darrah, Tijuana and Lill to eliminate"
84,00:04:31.63,00:04:31.63,"their biggest threat. And on day 27,"
85,00:04:35.40,00:04:35.40,"Rupert was voted out, leaving Sandra and Christa"
86,00:04:38.60,00:04:38.60,to fend for themselves. >> I cannot believe that.
87,00:04:41.70,00:04:41.70,">> PROBST: Rupert, the tribe has spoken."
88,00:04:45.50,00:04:45.50,"T, here's your high school sweetheart."
89,00:04:48.63,00:04:48.63,"On day 28, the Survivors' loved ones showed up"
90,00:04:51.80,00:04:51.80,to participate in a reward challenge.
91,00:04:54.30,00:04:54.30,(sobbing) And Jon got some devastating
92,00:04:57.43,00:04:57.43,"news from his friend, Dan. In a show of sympathy,"
93,00:05:05.50,00:05:05.50,the tribe let Jon win so that he could spend time
94,00:05:08.40,00:05:08.40,"with his friend. >> Thank you, everyone."
95,00:05:10.40,00:05:10.40,>> Of course. Of course. >> PROBST: But it was all a big
96,00:05:12.97,00:05:12.97,lie. >> That was a brilliant
97,00:05:15.03,00:05:15.03,"performance, sir. My grandmother's sitting home"
98,00:05:17.13,00:05:17.13,watching Jerry Springer right now.
99,00:05:19.40,00:05:19.40,"I haven't even come close to being voted off, dude."
100,00:05:21.43,00:05:21.43,">> Jon called me before he left and was like,"
101,00:05:24.07,00:05:24.07,"""If you come down here, tell me my grandma died."""
102,00:05:27.00,00:05:27.00,>> The fake dead grandmother could easily go down
103,00:05:30.00,00:05:30.00,as the dirtiest thing ever to be done in this game.
104,00:05:34.27,00:05:34.27,>> PROBST: Jon continued to plot with Burton.
105,00:05:36.97,00:05:36.97,"And, even though Sandra and Tijuana"
106,00:05:38.93,00:05:38.93,"secretly listened in on their conversation,"
107,00:05:41.37,00:05:41.37,"the men continued to dominate the game,"
108,00:05:43.70,00:05:43.70,as Jon convinced his enemies to vote out Tijuana.
109,00:05:46.57,00:05:46.57,The tribe has spoken. The women considered
110,00:05:50.73,00:05:50.73,forming their own alliance to overthrow Jon and Burton.
111,00:05:53.97,00:05:53.97,">> I want the guys to go. >> Yeah, yeah."
112,00:05:56.27,00:05:56.27,>> You think that'll work? >> PROBST: But when Jon left the
113,00:06:00.10,00:06:00.10,"camp with Lill and Darrah for a reward, he again"
114,00:06:02.90,00:06:02.90,worked his deception. He convinced Lill and Darrah
115,00:06:10.70,00:06:10.70,"to vote out Christa. Last week, Burton won the"
116,00:06:16.77,00:06:16.77,reward and chose to take Jon to the old Panama ruins
117,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07,"for an overnight feast, where he and Jon celebrated"
118,00:06:23.37,00:06:23.37,their control of the game. >> To the girls eating mussels.
119,00:06:26.10,00:06:26.10,">> To the girls eating mussels. >> PROBST: But back at camp,"
120,00:06:30.27,00:06:30.27,the women rekindled talk of an alliance.
121,00:06:33.33,00:06:33.33,">> So, if Burton wins immunity, Jon's going."
122,00:06:36.83,00:06:36.83,Right? >> Right.
123,00:06:38.33,00:06:38.33,">> PROBST: When Jon and Burton returned, they were immediately"
124,00:06:40.77,00:06:40.77,suspicious. >> I can't believe you three
125,00:06:43.23,00:06:43.23,didn't try to figure out a girl alliance to go
126,00:06:45.87,00:06:45.87,against Jon and me. >> Nope.
127,00:06:47.60,00:06:47.60,>> PROBST: And Sandra used Jon's strategy against him when she
128,00:06:50.50,00:06:50.50,told her own lie. >> I swear on my grandmother.
129,00:06:52.93,00:06:52.93,I swear. I swear. I swear. Now you guys have a plan or not?
130,00:06:55.80,00:06:55.80,>> I swear on my two kids that I'm with you guys.
131,00:06:58.57,00:06:58.57,"In my head, I was like, ""I swear on my kids that I'm"
132,00:07:01.07,00:07:01.07,"going to screw you and Burton."" >> PROBST: At the challenge,"
133,00:07:04.97,00:07:04.97,Darrah took home her third straight immunity.
134,00:07:08.20,00:07:08.20,"And at Tribal Council, the all-girl alliance finally held"
135,00:07:11.10,00:07:11.10,"and Burton was voted out. Burton, for the second time,"
136,00:07:15.70,00:07:15.70,"the tribe has spoken. Now, only four remain."
137,00:07:23.47,00:07:23.47,"Tonight, they will compete in their final"
138,00:07:25.50,00:07:25.50,immunity challenges. Two will continue on
139,00:07:28.17,00:07:28.17,to face the jury. One will outlast all the rest
140,00:07:31.80,00:07:31.80,and become the Sole Survivor. (theme song playing)

159,00:10:02.57,00:10:02.57,>> He goes from good to bad. >> I wonder if he'd like to join
160,00:10:05.80,00:10:05.80,"a troop. >> Oh, our letters."
161,00:10:09.60,00:10:09.60,>> Don't say that. >> Or a challenge.

174,00:10:42.97,00:10:42.97,See you later. >> Thank you.
175,00:10:45.90,00:10:45.90,Oh. This is to Jeff.
176,00:10:51.90,00:10:51.90,(Lillian gasps) >> Jeff brought back four
177,00:11:02.00,00:11:02.00,envelopes and they had our letters in them from home.
178,00:11:06.27,00:11:06.27,"So, we just all sat down and started reading our letters."
179,00:11:10.10,00:11:10.10,It's hard because you haven't talked to anybody in 37 days.
180,00:11:15.60,00:11:15.60,"I was just mainly worried about if my dog was okay and,"
181,00:11:19.03,00:11:19.03,"you know, my family. >> I got four letters from home:"
182,00:11:27.27,00:11:27.27,"one from my husband, my two girls and my mom."
183,00:11:31.17,00:11:31.17,"So, I started crying because you can't help but to cry."
184,00:11:34.93,00:11:34.93,It really felt good at a time like this
185,00:11:36.83,00:11:36.83,"when you got so many other things on your mind,"
186,00:11:39.60,00:11:39.60,and you do worry about your family.
187,00:11:41.20,00:11:41.20,"And then, to get a letter and know that everything's okay--"
188,00:11:43.47,00:11:43.47,"okay, fine, then I don't have to worry about them anymore."
189,00:11:45.77,00:11:45.77,"Now, it's time to focus on the end of the game."
190,00:11:48.37,00:11:48.37,">> ""Hey, Mom... ""everything is fine here at"

194,00:12:05.10,00:12:05.10,Having those letters from my three family members
195,00:12:08.23,00:12:08.23,made me realize that I have to keep going.
196,00:12:11.63,00:12:11.63,"I have to be strong for them. ""'Someone has to win"
197,00:12:14.43,00:12:14.43,"and someone has to lose. ""I believe in letting"
198,00:12:18.80,00:12:18.80,"someone else lose.' That's by Pete Rose."""
199,00:12:24.80,00:12:24.80,"This is my son. >> Oh, my God."
200,00:12:28.33,00:12:28.33,(sobbing) >> Lill went into such theatrics
201,00:12:32.70,00:12:32.70,"over her letter, that it pretty much overshadowed"
202,00:12:35.17,00:12:35.17,anyone else's letter. (moans)
203,00:12:39.20,00:12:39.20,That's been her M.O. from the beginning.
204,00:12:41.60,00:12:41.60,"Of course, Lill will break down into hysterics"
205,00:12:43.80,00:12:43.80,"and I hope to use that against her, hopefully, to show D."
206,00:12:46.67,00:12:46.67,"and Sandra, if she does this in front of a final jury,"
207,00:12:49.83,00:12:49.83,"you're screwed. So, have you guys made"
208,00:12:54.77,00:12:54.77,a deal amongst yourselves for final three?
209,00:12:59.30,00:12:59.30,"You can be honest. I take that as a ""yes."""
210,00:13:05.23,00:13:05.23,It is my head on the chopping block.
211,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50,It seems pretty obvious that... that the three of them have
212,00:13:10.03,00:13:10.03,"formed some kind of bond because, you know, all three"
213,00:13:12.30,00:13:12.30,share inferiority complexes to that of a man.
214,00:13:15.80,00:13:15.80,The fact that Sandra jumped ahead of me on the food chain
215,00:13:19.50,00:13:19.50,pisses me off to no end. >> I don't want to be third.
216,00:13:22.63,00:13:22.63,I want to be first or second. >> Of course you want to be
217,00:13:25.80,00:13:25.80,"first or second, 'cause if you're anywhere near that"
218,00:13:27.63,00:13:27.63,"freakin' jury, you're going to win and you know it."
219,00:13:29.90,00:13:29.90,">> I am not going to win. >> Y-you can say, ""I don't know,"
220,00:13:31.87,00:13:31.87,"I don't know, I don't know,"" but everyone here knows."
221,00:13:33.77,00:13:33.77,">> That is not true. > Yes, it is-- you're going to"
222,00:13:35.70,00:13:35.70,pull hearts and flowers like you did this morning.
223,00:13:37.50,00:13:37.50,That was just rehearsal for later.
224,00:13:39.03,00:13:39.03,">> What do you mean ""hearts and flowers""?"
225,00:13:41.00,00:13:41.00,>> Okay. >> You don't think
226,00:13:42.30,00:13:42.30,that they won't go by skills... >> Nope. Nope.
227,00:13:44.67,00:13:44.67,>> ... by strategy? >> They're going to go by
228,00:13:46.93,00:13:46.93,"you sitting there crying, that's what they're going to go by."
229,00:13:49.03,00:13:49.03,"And D. and Sandra are banking on that, because I think"
230,00:13:51.57,00:13:51.57,they're smart enough to know not to take you to the final.
231,00:13:54.37,00:13:54.37,">> Is that true, D.? >> I'm not getting in"
232,00:13:56.93,00:13:56.93,"the middle of this. >> I'm asking you,"
233,00:13:58.80,00:13:58.80,do I have your vote? >> It's going to be
234,00:14:01.37,00:14:01.37,"a lot to think about. I mean, you'll get"
235,00:14:03.43,00:14:03.43,more votes than I will. But I'm fine with
236,00:14:05.57,00:14:05.57,first or second. >> But would you
237,00:14:07.23,00:14:07.23,"take me to the end? >> I don't know, Lill."
238,00:14:09.60,00:14:09.60,"There's a lot to think about. You know, I can't sit here"
239,00:14:11.60,00:14:11.60,"and tell you that I will take you, and I can't sit here"
240,00:14:13.70,00:14:13.70,"and tell you I won't take you. And if I do take you, I'm"
241,00:14:16.60,00:14:16.60,"going to get my butt kicked. >> So, you're planning"
242,00:14:20.30,00:14:20.30,on taking Sandra. >> I don't know what
243,00:14:22.47,00:14:22.47,"I'm going to do. >> Darrah told me,"
244,00:14:26.00,00:14:26.00,"""You're a nice person, Lill, but I'm not going to take you"
245,00:14:29.57,00:14:29.57,"to the final two."" >> Lill, are you mad at me?"
246,00:14:32.43,00:14:32.43,">> No, I'm going to go over here..."
247,00:14:33.97,00:14:33.97,">> No, I want to talk to you. >> I want to be left alone,"
248,00:14:38.13,00:14:38.13,okay? I'm sorry... if that makes me mean.
249,00:14:44.27,00:14:44.27,"Nobody wants to go to the jury with me,"
250,00:14:47.40,00:14:47.40,'cause they think I'm nice. They all think I'm going to get
251,00:14:50.83,00:14:50.83,voted for because I'm nice. I'm just screwed
252,00:14:53.43,00:14:53.43,"all the way around. >> No one can beat that woman,"
253,00:14:57.83,00:14:57.83,and you know it. >> And she knows it.
254,00:14:59.83,00:14:59.83,"And she shouldn't sit here and pressure me, ""Oh, well,"
255,00:15:02.03,00:15:02.03,"you going to take me?"" ""Are you going to take me--"
256,00:15:03.90,00:15:03.90,"tell me right now."" Hell, I don't know"
257,00:15:05.37,00:15:05.37,if I'm even going to be here. >> I can guarantee
258,00:15:08.03,00:15:08.03,that you'll be here if me you and Sandra
259,00:15:10.03,00:15:10.03,"get rid of her tonight. So, all it takes is for"
260,00:15:11.97,00:15:11.97,"you to talk to Sandra, that's it, and Lill's ... gone."
261,00:15:15.93,00:15:15.93,>> You really can't trust Jon. You don't know
262,00:15:18.07,00:15:18.07,"if he's lying or not. But, I-I think my best bet"
263,00:15:20.20,00:15:20.20,would probably... me and Jon and Sandra.
264,00:15:28.37,00:15:28.37,Lill is only looking out for herself.
265,00:15:30.20,00:15:30.20,She's being selfish. She... all she wants is to win
266,00:15:33.23,00:15:33.23,just like everybody else. And she thinks everybody
267,00:15:34.93,00:15:34.93,"should take her to the end, because she knows that"
268,00:15:37.27,00:15:37.27,"she would whip our tails. >> Okay, so, if Jon was"
269,00:15:40.23,00:15:40.23,"to win Immunity tonight, then it would be Lill?"
270,00:15:43.00,00:15:43.00,>> I think if... even if he doesn't win.
271,00:15:45.50,00:15:45.50,">> We went to get water and Darrah was just talking about,"
272,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13,"""We need to get rid of Lill."" ""I think it would be good"
273,00:15:50.63,00:15:50.63,"to keep Jon,"" um... because he would be perfect"
274,00:15:53.17,00:15:53.17,"to go into the Final Two."" So, now, she's thinking Jon."
275,00:15:56.07,00:15:56.07,Fine. It could be Lill
276,00:15:58.10,00:15:58.10,"as long as it's not me. I come back, Darrah takes off."
277,00:16:02.13,00:16:02.13,"Now, Lill comes to me with her own strategy."
278,00:16:04.97,00:16:04.97,>> Can I... talk? >> What do you need?
279,00:16:06.33,00:16:06.33,>> I want to talk to you without ears here.
280,00:16:09.97,00:16:09.97,>> Oh. For Jon to go bye-bye? >> Okay.
281,00:16:14.10,00:16:14.10,>> Will you get out of here? >> Sure.
282,00:16:22.67,00:16:22.67,>> D. keeps winning... we're... we're sunk.
283,00:16:26.23,00:16:26.23,"We have a better shot at Immunity the next time around,"
284,00:16:30.33,00:16:30.33,"physically, 'cause I can't do it."
285,00:16:32.80,00:16:32.80,>> If she wasn't there? >> If she wasn't there.
286,00:16:35.10,00:16:35.10,'Cause she's going to keep winning these things.
287,00:16:36.77,00:16:36.77,>> Anything to keep myself longer in the game.
288,00:16:39.33,00:16:39.33,"I want to be in the game, too. >> Okay."
289,00:16:43.33,00:16:43.33,Then it's done. >> We've got to let him know.
290,00:16:46.43,00:16:46.43,'Cause he might vote against me or you tonight.
291,00:16:50.50,00:16:50.50,"So, he's got to know. >> Well, call him back."
292,00:16:53.53,00:16:53.53,Jon? The decision's been finalized.
293,00:16:56.53,00:16:56.53,"Go ahead, Lill, tell him."
294,00:16:58.03,00:16:58.03,>> Our whole thing is we want to get along as far as possible.
295,00:17:01.53,00:17:01.53,We two are not physically able
296,00:17:03.83,00:17:03.83,"to compete with her, as far as Immunity Challenges."
297,00:17:06.87,00:17:06.87,>> Agreed. >> If she doesn't
298,00:17:08.67,00:17:08.67,make Immunity... >> She's gone.
299,00:17:11.07,00:17:11.07,>> She's gone. >> Okay. I can...
300,00:17:12.90,00:17:12.90,I can accept that. >> You'll accept that?
301,00:17:14.90,00:17:14.90,>> Whenever you're in the hot seat and someone's
302,00:17:16.90,00:17:16.90,"ready to vote you off, create tension between"
303,00:17:18.90,00:17:18.90,two other people and those people...
304,00:17:20.90,00:17:20.90,those two people's heads usually end up
305,00:17:22.90,00:17:22.90,"on the chopping block. Case-in-point, tonight:"
306,00:17:25.00,00:17:25.00,it's either D. or Lill. Isn't that crazy?
307,00:17:28.67,00:17:28.67,">> All right, enough said then. As it stands now,"
308,00:17:32.33,00:17:32.33,"if either Darrah or Lill wins Immunity,"
309,00:17:34.73,00:17:34.73,then the other one goes. I really don't give a damn
310,00:17:37.33,00:17:37.33,"which one of the two goes, as long as it ain't me."
311,00:17:53.47,00:17:53.47,>> Got sea mail! >> Come this way.
312,00:17:56.80,00:17:56.80,">> ""So, here you are, the final four."
313,00:17:59.30,00:17:59.30,"""But, after tonight, you'll lose one more."
314,00:18:01.67,00:18:01.67,"""So, head to Tribal Council like you always do."
315,00:18:04.70,00:18:04.70,"Your peers and your fate are waiting for you."""
316,00:18:08.73,00:18:08.73,">> The tree mail came and, uh, it said something about"
317,00:18:11.80,00:18:11.80,just head out to Tribal Council as usual.
318,00:18:14.17,00:18:14.17,"""That your peers and your fate will be determined,"" I guess,"
319,00:18:17.50,00:18:17.50,"by the ""peers,"" meaning the jury."
320,00:18:21.10,00:18:21.10,So everyone's kind of freaking out.
321,00:18:30.97,00:18:30.97,>> I don't care if it's a physical challenge
322,00:18:33.03,00:18:33.03,or a mental challenge tonight. I'm the king of men
323,00:18:35.03,00:18:35.03,and they're women. There's a huge difference.
324,00:18:37.67,00:18:37.67,"I mean, like, you know... if it's a getting-pregnant"
325,00:18:40.17,00:18:40.17,"contest, yeah, they could... they could probably win,"
326,00:18:42.80,00:18:42.80,"but other than that, no. Mentally, physically, I got..."
327,00:18:45.70,00:18:45.70,I can beat any of them. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
328,00:19:17.93,00:19:17.93,"the members of the jury: Ryno, Rupert, T."
329,00:19:20.00,00:19:20.00,"Christa and Burton, voted out at"
330,00:19:26.27,00:19:26.27,the last Tribal Council. Okay.
331,00:19:30.73,00:19:30.73,"At tonight's Tribal Council, we will vote out the 13th member"
332,00:19:34.17,00:19:34.17,from your tribe. They will become
333,00:19:35.90,00:19:35.90,the sixth member of the jury. But before we get
334,00:19:38.60,00:19:38.60,"to Tribal Council, we have an Immunity Challenge"
335,00:19:40.63,00:19:40.63,"to take care of. So, Darrah,"
336,00:19:42.50,00:19:42.50,"need to get that back. Immunity is back up for grabs,"
337,00:19:50.23,00:19:50.23,and tonight it truly is up for grabs.
338,00:19:53.40,00:19:53.40,"Once again, the ghosts of your past"
339,00:19:56.57,00:19:56.57,will play a role in this game. Here's how it's going to work.
340,00:20:00.57,00:20:00.57,The four of you will compete as individuals for Immunity.
341,00:20:04.63,00:20:04.63,"In addition, the jury will compete as a group"
342,00:20:09.17,00:20:09.17,"in this Immunity Challenge. If the jury wins,"
343,00:20:12.37,00:20:12.37,"Immunity has no value to them, but it has"
344,00:20:15.73,00:20:15.73,"a huge consequence to you, because nobody"
345,00:20:17.53,00:20:17.53,will have Immunity when we go into
346,00:20:20.40,00:20:20.40,"tonight's Tribal Council. And, as many"
347,00:20:24.60,00:20:24.60,surprise Tribal Councils and blindsided votes
348,00:20:27.30,00:20:27.30,"as you guys have had, Immunity probably"
349,00:20:29.87,00:20:29.87,has never had as much value as it does tonight.
350,00:20:34.10,00:20:34.10,I'm going to ask you a series of questions
351,00:20:36.70,00:20:36.70,based on survival and pirate folklore.
352,00:20:40.03,00:20:40.03,"The first to five wins Immunity. For the jury,"
353,00:20:44.43,00:20:44.43,"you'll come up with one answer. So, you'll be deciding"
354,00:20:47.57,00:20:47.57,"by committee. Could work for you,"
355,00:20:49.23,00:20:49.23,could work against you. Ready?
356,00:20:51.77,00:20:51.77,"First question: ""According to your"

526,00:31:29.60,00:31:29.60,"about 60 pounds soaking wet. Lill and Jon,"

536,00:32:08.57,00:32:08.57,had to go. Darrah had won immunity
537,00:32:10.87,00:32:10.87,three times in a row. And she was still the strongest
538,00:32:14.50,00:32:14.50,"one of all of us. So, um, we all decided"
539,00:32:17.30,00:32:17.30,that she would be the one going home tonight.
540,00:32:20.13,00:32:20.13,"So, now, it's down to Jon, Lill and myself."

545,00:32:35.77,00:32:35.77,that it worked out the way it did.

570,00:34:31.90,00:34:31.90,"in full pirate style, to your former tribe members"
571,00:34:34.73,00:34:34.73,who are no longer in this game. You'll take their torches.
572,00:34:37.43,00:34:37.43,"One at a time you'll place them on the shipwreck,"
573,00:34:40.87,00:34:40.87,say a few words about how they
574,00:34:42.70,00:34:42.70,"played this game. You'll then come back here,"
575,00:34:45.50,00:34:45.50,"take the muskets, fire upon the shipwreck,"
576,00:34:48.07,00:34:48.07,igniting it in a fiery celebration
577,00:34:52.40,00:34:52.40,honoring those tribe members. You spent a lot of time
578,00:34:55.97,00:34:55.97,with these people. Embrace it.
579,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,One person did not finish their game.
580,00:35:00.73,00:35:00.73,Their torch remains at Tribal Council.
581,00:35:02.53,00:35:02.53,It will not be a part of this celebration.
582,00:35:04.40,00:35:04.40,"When you're finished, you'll paddle to"
583,00:35:06.47,00:35:06.47,your final immunity challenge. I'll be waiting for you there.
584,00:35:11.50,00:35:11.50,Grab your torches. Head to the boat.
585,00:35:29.03,00:35:29.03,">> Nicole, you were the first one out."
586,00:35:33.03,00:35:33.03,What a wonderful spirit you had.
587,00:35:36.03,00:35:36.03,I enjoyed being with you for those several days
588,00:35:38.40,00:35:38.40,as an Outcast. I think of you often.
589,00:35:42.43,00:35:42.43,>> Rocking body. >> Ryan...
590,00:35:50.53,00:35:50.53,you were my best friend here. I didn't cry
591,00:35:56.37,00:35:56.37,until you were kicked out. I miss you a lot.
592,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,"You are pure of heart. >> Michelle, um, we were"
593,00:36:08.00,00:36:08.00,together from day one and it's a shame
594,00:36:11.00,00:36:11.00,we didn't get to know each other better.
595,00:36:13.10,00:36:13.10,You were fun-loving and energetic.
596,00:36:15.63,00:36:15.63,We wish you could have stuck around longer.
597,00:36:24.00,00:36:24.00,">> Trish... you're, uh, best sleeping partner"
598,00:36:29.03,00:36:29.03,a guy can have in this game. I thought we would have
599,00:36:32.20,00:36:32.20,made it further together. >> Shawn...
600,00:36:41.47,00:36:41.47,you were a great guy with tons of stories
601,00:36:44.17,00:36:44.17,and you loved to eat. >> Andrew...
602,00:36:54.50,00:36:54.50,you were the leader of the Morgan tribe.
603,00:36:57.43,00:36:57.43,I know you tried hard to make sure
604,00:36:59.47,00:36:59.47,everything was done right and that everybody was fair.
605,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,"Thank you, Andrew. >> Ryno... I got to know you"
606,00:37:09.13,00:37:09.13,in a very short time and you were
607,00:37:10.97,00:37:10.97,"very pleasant and loving. And, you know,"
608,00:37:12.93,00:37:12.93,"when you were gone, I kind of missed you."
609,00:37:21.70,00:37:21.70,>> Rupert... you're one of the greatest guys
610,00:37:24.80,00:37:24.80,"to ever play the game. >> Without you, I don't know"
611,00:37:29.10,00:37:29.10,"how I would have made it. If it wasn't for you,"
612,00:37:31.50,00:37:31.50,"I'd be damned starving. So, um, I'm glad me and you"
613,00:37:34.07,00:37:34.07,"became really, really tight and I love you very, very much"
614,00:37:37.27,00:37:37.27,"and I miss you. >> Tijuana, the night"
615,00:37:46.87,00:37:46.87,that you and I were cast off and was
616,00:37:48.93,00:37:48.93,"on the island by ourselves, you looked at me and told me"
617,00:37:52.00,00:37:52.00,thank you for my friendship and how much you loved me.
618,00:37:55.87,00:37:55.87,"That touched my heart greatly. And I still do love you, too, T."
619,00:38:04.10,00:38:04.10,">> Christa, out of everyone here, I miss you the most."
620,00:38:07.57,00:38:07.57,"You know, me and you were real tight,"
621,00:38:11.03,00:38:11.03,"and we'll see each other again, and we'll be buddy-buddy"
622,00:38:13.10,00:38:13.10,and it'll be all great. >> Burton...
623,00:38:20.87,00:38:20.87,you became my best friend in the game.
624,00:38:22.87,00:38:22.87,"Unbelievable. >> My Eagle Scout,"
625,00:38:28.10,00:38:28.10,I appreciated the time that we spent together
626,00:38:31.20,00:38:31.20,and I'm amazed that you still know
627,00:38:32.97,00:38:32.97,"the oath and the laws. Here's to you, sir."
628,00:38:39.77,00:38:39.77,">> D, you're as, uh, nice as you are cute."
629,00:38:47.63,00:38:47.63,I miss you. >> Ready?
630,00:39:21.97,00:39:21.97,Aim. Fire.
631,00:39:38.90,00:39:38.90,">> Oh, my gosh. Look at that."
632,00:39:44.57,00:39:44.57,>> Thank the Lord that our torches are not
633,00:39:47.00,00:39:47.00,up there burning. >> Thank you.
634,00:40:54.50,00:40:54.50,">> PROBST: Right this way, guys! Drop that anchor."
635,00:40:59.47,00:40:59.47,"Get on your platform. Welcome, guys, to your final"
636,00:41:10.43,00:41:10.43,immunity challenge. It's based on
637,00:41:13.47,00:41:13.47,"an old pirate torture, where they would take prisoners,"
638,00:41:16.03,00:41:16.03,"put them on small rafts, set them adrift in the ocean,"
639,00:41:19.63,00:41:19.63,and leave them for dead. Today's challenge
640,00:41:21.53,00:41:21.53,will test your ability to battle fatigue
641,00:41:23.90,00:41:23.90,and the elements. You're gonna be balancing
642,00:41:27.23,00:41:27.23,"on these rafts. You can use your feet,"
643,00:41:30.80,00:41:30.80,and you can use your hands for balance.
644,00:41:32.80,00:41:32.80,"If your bottom or your knees touch the platform,"
645,00:41:37.17,00:41:37.17,you're out. Last person left standing
646,00:41:39.27,00:41:39.27,"on their raft wins immunity for the final time,"
647,00:41:43.47,00:41:43.47,"guarantees themself a spot in the final two, and..."
648,00:41:47.13,00:41:47.13,gets to decide who sits next to them
649,00:41:48.93,00:41:48.93,at the final vote. I'll give you a minute
650,00:41:52.07,00:41:52.07,to get in position. We'll get started.
651,00:41:57.40,00:41:57.40,"For the last time, immunity is up for grabs."
652,00:42:02.80,00:42:02.80,This challenge has begun. Don't let your knees
653,00:42:06.33,00:42:06.33,or your butt touch your raft. This should go for a long time.
654,00:42:10.37,00:42:10.37,You guys have been out here for 38 days.
655,00:42:12.83,00:42:12.83,You've proven you can last. You got a million dollars
656,00:42:15.60,00:42:15.60,"at stake. Lill, with her Boy Scout"
657,00:42:17.47,00:42:17.47,"uniform; Jonny Fairplay,"
658,00:42:19.80,00:42:19.80,"would-be W. W. E. wrestler; and Sandra, the lippiest mother"
659,00:42:24.17,00:42:24.17,we've ever had represented in the final three.
660,00:42:28.40,00:42:28.40,">> Not the final three I think anyone else envisioned, Jeff."
661,00:42:31.00,00:42:31.00,">> PROBST: What are you thinking about, Sandra?"
662,00:42:33.20,00:42:33.20,">> Quitters never win, and winners never quit."
663,00:42:35.00,00:42:35.00,>> PROBST: Good. We're gonna be here
664,00:42:36.47,00:42:36.47,"a while, then. You guys are at 15 minutes."
665,00:42:50.47,00:42:50.47,>> 15 longest minutes of my life.
666,00:42:52.70,00:42:52.70,">> PROBST: Anybody starting to feel it at all, or you doing"
667,00:42:54.70,00:42:54.70,okay? >> I'm feeling it.
668,00:42:56.07,00:42:56.07,"My feet are numb... already. >> PROBST: Lill, how about you?"
669,00:42:59.97,00:42:59.97,>> I'm feeling really darn good. >> PROBST: No pain?
670,00:43:02.70,00:43:02.70,">> A little numbness, but no. >> PROBST: Sandra, worth a"
671,00:43:06.07,00:43:06.07,million dollars? >> Worth a million dollars.
672,00:43:08.73,00:43:08.73,">> PROBST: It's gonna get a lot worse than this, you guys."
673,00:43:11.07,00:43:11.07,"Some big waves coming in. Hang tight, guys."
674,00:43:29.27,00:43:29.27,"And like that, Sandra is out. Lill, Jon,"
675,00:43:34.10,00:43:34.10,"don't lose your concentration. >> Lill, you want to make a deal"
676,00:43:37.80,00:43:37.80,"right now? >> No, sir."
677,00:43:38.60,00:43:38.60,>> You're crazy. >> My daughter wants
678,00:43:40.13,00:43:40.13,to be a doctor. >> Do you understand how...
679,00:43:42.63,00:43:42.63,">> Jon, don't talk to me. >> Do you understand"
680,00:43:44.53,00:43:44.53,"how the deals work, Lill?! >> Shut up."
681,00:43:47.80,00:43:47.80,">> Lill, if you give me immunity, I will take you"
682,00:43:51.50,00:43:51.50,to the final two. That's what... a deal is.
683,00:43:57.23,00:43:57.23,">> And if you trust me, then you jump in."
684,00:43:59.00,00:43:59.00,>> I don't know that I can trust you.
685,00:44:00.90,00:44:00.90,>> Then drop it. >> PROBST: Looks like you're
686,00:44:04.03,00:44:04.03,"gonna have to win it on your own, Jon."
687,00:44:16.50,00:44:16.50,You're at 30 minutes. If the first 15 were the longest
688,00:44:19.73,00:44:19.73,"15 of your life, Jon, how have the second 15 been?"
689,00:44:22.67,00:44:22.67,">> Oh, these sucked twice as much."
690,00:44:24.63,00:44:24.63,"(Jon laughs) Lill, who do you want"
691,00:44:28.47,00:44:28.47,to go against in the final two?
692,00:44:30.80,00:44:30.80,">> How many people have you screwed over, Jon?"
693,00:44:32.67,00:44:32.67,>> Everyone in the game. >> Do you know what?
694,00:44:35.70,00:44:35.70,I do aerobics. >> Okay.
695,00:44:38.33,00:44:38.33,>> My knees are great. >> Okay.
696,00:44:40.80,00:44:40.80,>> My ankles are great. >> Okay.
697,00:44:42.47,00:44:42.47,>> These are called squats in aerobics.
698,00:44:45.00,00:44:45.00,>> Okay. All right. >> PROBST: I think Lill
699,00:44:47.40,00:44:47.40,"just said, ""Game on."" >> I think Lill said, ""Game"
700,00:44:51.13,00:44:51.13,"over. "" >> PROBST: Coming up on two"
701,00:45:04.87,00:45:04.87,hours you've been out here. >> Ready for a deal?
702,00:45:07.70,00:45:07.70,">> I'm not going to deal, honey. >> I'll give you immunity,"
703,00:45:10.33,00:45:10.33,if you take me to the final. >> I'm not gonna promise
704,00:45:13.10,00:45:13.10,"anything. >> Well, then... that's"
705,00:45:14.73,00:45:14.73,"that's not a deal, Lill.  >> Well, I'm not"
706,00:45:18.50,00:45:18.50,"gonna deal, then. >> PROBST: Jon, how confident"
707,00:45:20.07,00:45:20.07,are you right now about your chances of winning this?
708,00:45:22.47,00:45:22.47,>> Not extremely. Not at all like this.
709,00:45:43.53,00:45:43.53,">> PROBST: Coming up on two hours, 45 minutes."
710,00:45:52.03,00:45:52.03,Jon's struggling to hang on. Jon...
711,00:46:04.70,00:46:04.70,"is out, lost his balance. Lill wins her first"
712,00:46:07.50,00:46:07.50,"and most important immunity. Nicely done, Lill."
713,00:46:12.30,00:46:12.30,"Once you have your formal wear on, Lill,"
714,00:46:15.30,00:46:15.30,"come over here, put this belt on."
715,00:46:19.33,00:46:19.33,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: Hang tight.
716,00:46:23.27,00:46:23.27,I'll put this on you. (yelps)
717,00:46:28.83,00:46:28.83,You all right? Those legs going?
718,00:46:30.67,00:46:30.67,>> Yep. >> PROBST: Want to take a seat?
719,00:46:33.20,00:46:33.20,">> No. I'm fine. >> PROBST: First immunity,"
720,00:46:35.17,00:46:35.17,"it's the last immunity, definitely the most"
721,00:46:37.97,00:46:37.97,important immunity. You have this afternoon
722,00:46:40.93,00:46:40.93,to think about whether it's going
723,00:46:42.20,00:46:42.20,to be Jon or Sandra that you're taking with you
724,00:46:45.67,00:46:45.67,to the final two. The most important decision
725,00:46:47.97,00:46:47.97,"you'll make in this game. >> Thank you, sir."
726,00:46:50.97,00:46:50.97,>> PROBST: Well-earned. See you guys at Tribal Council.
727,00:47:20.53,00:47:20.53,>> That was so tough. That was one of the hardest
728,00:47:23.97,00:47:23.97,"things I think I've ever done. I was so nervous, I felt like"
729,00:47:26.90,00:47:26.90,"I was going to throw up. I knew if somebody else won it,"
730,00:47:30.13,00:47:30.13,I would be out of the game. I didn't think I had a chance.
731,00:47:35.23,00:47:35.23,"Welcome home, baby, welcome home."
732,00:47:37.47,00:47:37.47,"Oh, baby, oh. This was nothing to do"
733,00:47:40.53,00:47:40.53,"with bargains, nothing to do with..."
734,00:47:43.30,00:47:43.30,"scheming, strategy. This was for Lill,"
735,00:47:47.13,00:47:47.13,and Lill only. And I wanted it for her.
736,00:47:50.70,00:47:50.70,Come on. Come on.
737,00:47:52.90,00:47:52.90,">> Just remember, I have a husband and kids, too,"
738,00:47:55.10,00:47:55.10,I would like to provide for. >> We're not even going
739,00:47:57.57,00:47:57.57,"to discuss it, okay? >> If she were smart, she'd keep"
740,00:48:00.80,00:48:00.80,Jon and vote me out tonight. I will be in damn shock
741,00:48:03.93,00:48:03.93,"if I'm not voted out tonight. >> That immunity challenge was,"
742,00:48:06.63,00:48:06.63,uh... about the most hardcore thing
743,00:48:10.03,00:48:10.03,I've ever done. I really didn't have feeling
744,00:48:12.57,00:48:12.57,left in my legs when I got out of the boat.
745,00:48:15.93,00:48:15.93,And I'm just trying to get everything moving again.
746,00:48:18.83,00:48:18.83,My gut right now says I'm going home tonight.
747,00:48:22.57,00:48:22.57,I'm not going down without a fight.
748,00:48:25.50,00:48:25.50,"Sandra thinks, uh, that she's going."
749,00:48:27.87,00:48:27.87,So... it's all in Lill's hands. >> You could easily
750,00:48:33.67,00:48:33.67,"have voted me out yesterday, right along with Darrah."
751,00:48:36.73,00:48:36.73,">> You looked me in the eyes, and you said,"
752,00:48:39.20,00:48:39.20,"""Darrah,"" and I said, ""Lill, whatever you want."""
753,00:48:41.83,00:48:41.83,"You looked me in the eyes the day before,"
754,00:48:43.97,00:48:43.97,"then you said, ""Burton."" I said, ""Lill, whatever you want."""
755,00:48:46.43,00:48:46.43,"Lill, will you take me with you? Say, ""Sandra, whatever you"
756,00:48:49.23,00:48:49.23,"want."" >> I have a choice."
757,00:48:51.47,00:48:51.47,"Sandra, she's got a family, She's got children,"
758,00:48:54.70,00:48:54.70,"she's got a husband, she works. But, then again, Sandra has"
759,00:48:59.03,00:48:59.03,a few people on that jury that like her.
760,00:49:01.97,00:49:01.97,She may have a good shot at it. >> Mind if I say something
761,00:49:05.33,00:49:05.33,before Tribal Council? >> Sure.
762,00:49:06.73,00:49:06.73,">> No one dislikes you, Lill. Everyone hates me."
763,00:49:09.77,00:49:09.77,">> Burton doesn't. >> I got one vote, Lill."
764,00:49:13.53,00:49:13.53,"Can you live with a 6-1 victory? I mean, do you..."
765,00:49:18.23,00:49:18.23,You won't get a 6-1 against Sandra.
766,00:49:20.37,00:49:20.37,">> What's that mean? >> She's got Christa, she's"
767,00:49:23.30,00:49:23.30,"got Rupert, she's got Ryno. >> You got a point."
768,00:49:27.80,00:49:27.80,I'm thinking on two different areas
769,00:49:30.47,00:49:30.47,as far as selecting the right person to go with me tonight.
770,00:49:34.53,00:49:34.53,"First of all, Jon keeps telling me how much everybody hates him."
771,00:49:37.87,00:49:37.87,"He has lied to everybody, and he has screwed them over"
772,00:49:41.87,00:49:41.87,more than one or two times. And he may be right.
773,00:49:44.83,00:49:44.83,I may be able to win hands down
774,00:49:47.23,00:49:47.23,"because he is so hated. But then, on the other hand,"
775,00:49:50.63,00:49:50.63,"I may not, because he is good at this."
776,00:49:52.90,00:49:52.90,\xe2\x99\xaa Amazing grace \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa How sweet the sound \xe2\x99\xaa
777,00:49:58.20,00:49:58.20,\xe2\x99\xaa That saved a wretch \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Like me \xe2\x99\xaa
778,00:50:04.93,00:50:04.93,\xe2\x99\xaa I once was lost \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Now I'm found \xe2\x99\xaa

780,00:50:57.13,00:50:57.13,bring in the members of our jury.
781,00:51:00.70,00:51:00.70,"Ryno, Rupert, T, Christa,"
782,00:51:05.87,00:51:05.87,"Burton and Darrah, voted out at last"
783,00:51:08.93,00:51:08.93,"night's Tribal Council. Well, for the second"
784,00:51:17.53,00:51:17.53,"day in a row, you started out with a very early morning--"
785,00:51:21.10,00:51:21.10,sunrise. Took most of the torches
786,00:51:24.47,00:51:24.47,"from the former tribe members, people"
787,00:51:27.43,00:51:27.43,"no longer in this game, and you had"
788,00:51:28.90,00:51:28.90,"a tribute to them. Jon, was there anybody"
789,00:51:31.93,00:51:31.93,"that stood out for you, that when"
790,00:51:33.83,00:51:33.83,"you put their torch in, you had either a strong feeling,"
791,00:51:37.03,00:51:37.03,"good or bad? >> Yeah, there were two"
792,00:51:39.30,00:51:39.30,"that really jumped out at me. Uh, Burton, because, uh..."
793,00:51:43.10,00:51:43.10,I really didn't come into this game
794,00:51:45.83,00:51:45.83,"looking to, uh... to leave with, uh, just a..."
795,00:51:49.67,00:51:49.67,"a-a really awesome friend, and I, uh... I did with him."
796,00:51:54.00,00:51:54.00,"And, uh, Rupert, uh, in that, uh, Rupert's one of the nicest"
797,00:51:59.97,00:51:59.97,"guys I've ever met and a great guy, but, uh,"
798,00:52:04.30,00:52:04.30,"the strongest competitor, and, uh, the most obvious choice"
799,00:52:08.00,00:52:08.00,to win a seven-oh jury this game's ever seen.
800,00:52:11.40,00:52:11.40,"So, those two just really jumped out, and they were, uh,"
801,00:52:14.10,00:52:14.10,kind of tough for me. >> PROBST: After you paid
802,00:52:16.60,00:52:16.60,"tribute, you had an immunity challenge, one"
803,00:52:19.10,00:52:19.10,that all three of you wanted desperately.
804,00:52:21.60,00:52:21.60,"Sandra, you were first out. What did you feel"
805,00:52:23.90,00:52:23.90,when you knew you were out and no longer
806,00:52:25.63,00:52:25.63,in contention for immunity? >> In shock.
807,00:52:28.50,00:52:28.50,"And then I figured, ""Well, Lill will be out in no time."""
808,00:52:31.90,00:52:31.90,"But for Lill to just be there like it doesn't even hurt,"
809,00:52:35.33,00:52:35.33,"like she's not even in pain, and Jon is shaking"
810,00:52:38.23,00:52:38.23,"all over the place. And I was, like,"
811,00:52:40.40,00:52:40.40,"""What in the hell is going on?"" Because everyone always thought,"
812,00:52:43.97,00:52:43.97,"if there's anyone you'd want to go to in a challenge like that,"
813,00:52:46.47,00:52:46.47,"it would be up against Lill, because she'd be no competition."
814,00:52:49.53,00:52:49.53,Who would have thought? Look what's she's wearing.
815,00:52:51.70,00:52:51.70,>> I didn't... I didn't think it.
816,00:52:53.20,00:52:53.20,">> PROBST: Lill, this is really the last chance"
817,00:52:56.80,00:52:56.80,you'll have to control your fate.
818,00:52:58.23,00:52:58.23,"After tonight, all power shifts to the jury."
819,00:53:02.23,00:53:02.23,"You're wearing immunity, basically choosing"
820,00:53:05.87,00:53:05.87,who you want to sit next to in this vote.
821,00:53:07.87,00:53:07.87,>> Mm-hmm. >> PROBST: I just want to run
822,00:53:10.10,00:53:10.10,through some of the attributes you might consider in making
823,00:53:12.67,00:53:12.67,that decision. >> I thought about the strategy
824,00:53:14.53,00:53:14.53,that this young man constantly comes up with.
825,00:53:19.20,00:53:19.20,His mind is always going. He's always got a way out
826,00:53:22.80,00:53:22.80,"of everything. Then, we got Sandra here."
827,00:53:26.57,00:53:26.57,She's got several friends on the jury
828,00:53:28.77,00:53:28.77,that truly claim her as a little sister.
829,00:53:33.67,00:53:33.67,"And that's also scary. >> PROBST: So, as you sit here"
830,00:53:37.23,00:53:37.23,"tonight wearing immunity, having one vote to cast"
831,00:53:40.87,00:53:40.87,"for one of these two people, what does it"
832,00:53:43.37,00:53:43.37,"finally come down to? >> For me, it's gonna come down"
833,00:53:48.47,00:53:48.47,to whether or not... I can possibly beat
834,00:53:53.20,00:53:53.20,that other person in the final vote.
835,00:53:58.47,00:53:58.47,">> PROBST: All right, here's how tonight's vote will work."
836,00:54:02.47,00:54:02.47,Jon can't vote for Lill. He can only vote for Sandra.
837,00:54:05.43,00:54:05.43,Sandra can't vote for Lill. She can only vote for Jon.
838,00:54:08.33,00:54:08.33,Your votes cancel each other out.
839,00:54:10.20,00:54:10.20,"So, Lill, you will be the only one that is voting,"
840,00:54:12.87,00:54:12.87,and you are voting the fourteenth person
841,00:54:15.07,00:54:15.07,"out of this game. >> Yes, sir."
842,00:54:18.37,00:54:18.37,">> PROBST: And in doing so, you're deciding who you're gonna"
843,00:54:20.57,00:54:20.57,be sitting next to tomorrow night at final Tribal Council.
844,00:54:22.53,00:54:22.53,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: With that,"
845,00:54:24.60,00:54:24.60,"are you ready to make the vote? >> Yes, sir."
846,00:54:26.97,00:54:26.97,>> PROBST: It is time to vote. Lill.
847,00:55:13.63,00:55:13.63,"I'll go get the vote. Once the votes are read, the"
848,00:55:33.07,00:55:33.07,decision is final. The person voted
849,00:55:34.33,00:55:34.33,out will be asked to leave the Tribal
850,00:55:36.03,00:55:36.03,Council area immediately. I'll read the vote.
851,00:55:43.70,00:55:43.70,Fourteenth person voted out of the tribe...
852,00:55:51.50,00:55:51.50,"Jonny Fairplay. >> Oh, my God."
853,00:55:53.53,00:55:53.53,">> PROBST: Need to bring me your torch, Jon."
854,00:55:56.20,00:55:56.20,">> Well, I was packed and ready to go, Lill."
855,00:55:59.00,00:55:59.00,">> I'm sorry, Jon. >> Oh, my God."
856,00:56:00.93,00:56:00.93,">> Peace out. >> PROBST: Jon, the tribe"
857,00:56:06.13,00:56:06.13,has spoken. It's time for you to go.
858,00:56:24.37,00:56:24.37,Congratulations. You have gone as far
859,00:56:26.87,00:56:26.87,as you can go in this game. >> Thank you.
860,00:56:29.03,00:56:29.03,>> PROBST: There will be one final Tribal Council
861,00:56:31.83,00:56:31.83,"tomorrow night, so, you have the rest of"
862,00:56:34.70,00:56:34.70,"tonight, during the day tomorrow to think about"
863,00:56:37.30,00:56:37.30,what you want to say to convince your jury
864,00:56:40.13,00:56:40.13,"of why they should vote for you, why you"
865,00:56:43.23,00:56:43.23,are most deserving of the title of Sole Survivor
866,00:56:46.50,00:56:46.50,and the million dollar cash prize.
867,00:56:49.17,00:56:49.17,You can head back to camp. Enjoy your last night
868,00:56:52.83,00:56:52.83,in the Pearl Islands. >> Thank you.
869,00:56:55.37,00:56:55.37,>> PROBST: Good night. >> Pretty proud of myself.
870,00:57:03.57,00:57:03.57,"I, uh, never gave up, and, uh..."
871,00:57:07.03,00:57:07.03,"I, uh... didn't play fair,"
872,00:57:10.30,00:57:10.30,"and, uh, didn't plan on it. Happy that my grandma's at home"
873,00:57:14.53,00:57:14.53,and doing just fine. Can't wait to see her.
874,00:57:17.57,00:57:17.57,"In a game in which the old term, uh,"
875,00:57:19.53,00:57:19.53,"""to be the man, you got to beat the man"""
876,00:57:21.27,00:57:21.27,"comes into play, uh, I was the last man, so..."
877,00:57:28.07,00:57:28.07,Peace out from Jonny Fairplay. >> I really appreciate
878,00:57:46.43,00:57:46.43,"this, Lill. Thank you very much."
879,00:57:48.60,00:57:48.60,">> Well, I have no regrets. >> When Jeff came down, I had my"
880,00:57:51.03,00:57:51.03,"hands on my stuff, Lill. >> Yeah?"
881,00:57:53.40,00:57:53.40,">> I was... I said, ""I'm going home."""
882,00:57:55.13,00:57:55.13,>> No. >> No regrets.
883,00:57:57.13,00:57:57.13,">> When Sandra and I came back from the Tribal Council,"
884,00:57:59.33,00:57:59.33,and the realization hit us that we are what they call
885,00:58:02.73,00:58:02.73,the two Sole Survivors. We made it through.
886,00:58:06.70,00:58:06.70,"It was a good feeling knowing that, um,"
887,00:58:09.00,00:58:09.00,I came into the game not knowing a huge amount
888,00:58:11.40,00:58:11.40,"about it, but I'm still here. How surprised were you?"
889,00:58:15.17,00:58:15.17,>> Surprised? I... When I saw you writing
890,00:58:17.63,00:58:17.63,"a whole bunch, I said, ""Oh, she's"
891,00:58:19.27,00:58:19.27,"writing Sandra."" 'Cause Jon ain't but J-O-N."
892,00:58:22.63,00:58:22.63,">> I picked Sandra because I'm hoping that strategy-wise,"
893,00:58:26.33,00:58:26.33,I have more friends on that jury than she does.
894,00:58:28.43,00:58:28.43,"Um, emotional-wise, I felt that"
895,00:58:33.50,00:58:33.50,I wanted Sandra to have the money
896,00:58:35.17,00:58:35.17,more than Jon. He was so manipulative.
897,00:58:37.57,00:58:37.57,>> Mm-hmm. >> And he thought he could just
898,00:58:41.50,00:58:41.50,demand whatever he wanted from me and my votes.
899,00:58:45.03,00:58:45.03,"You know, this is what Jon talks about--"
900,00:58:47.87,00:58:47.87,drinking and partying and women and...
901,00:58:50.97,00:58:50.97,">> Yeah. >> You and I, we're a family."
902,00:58:54.07,00:58:54.07,"Whatever was best for our kids, your husband."
903,00:58:56.37,00:58:56.37,"I mean, that touches me. >> I thought,"
904,00:58:59.37,00:58:59.37,"before we even left the camp, that my fate was sealed,"
905,00:59:03.60,00:59:03.60,"that I was third in line. In my head, I already"
906,00:59:06.33,00:59:06.33,"had it planned. ""Okay, grab the torch,"
907,00:59:08.13,00:59:08.13,"step in the right place."" 'Cause every time somebody's"
908,00:59:10.53,00:59:10.53,"surprised and in shock, they're all over the damn place."
909,00:59:13.63,00:59:13.63,>> But you and I have lasted the whole time.
910,00:59:16.83,00:59:16.83,>> Yeah. From the first
911,00:59:18.83,00:59:18.83,"night to the last. >> So now, Sandra and I"
912,00:59:21.93,00:59:21.93,"are just going to chill out tonight, go to bed,"
913,00:59:25.23,00:59:25.23,"get up in the morning, just kind of relax"
914,00:59:28.63,00:59:28.63,"a little bit, and, um, pack our stuff up and go"
915,00:59:31.73,00:59:31.73,"to final Tribal Council. Plain, simple."
916,00:59:35.47,00:59:35.47,(sighs) Survivor is not
917,00:59:56.97,00:59:56.97,for the faint of heart. It is hard on you.
918,01:00:01.53,01:00:01.53,And you have to be mentally prepared
919,01:00:03.53,01:00:03.53,and you have to be physically prepared.
920,01:00:06.33,01:00:06.33,For somebody to stand back in their living room and judge
921,01:00:09.73,01:00:09.73,"any one of these 16 contestants for the things that they did,"
922,01:00:13.80,01:00:13.80,"they don't realize, it is not a camping trip."
923,01:00:19.30,01:00:19.30,My middle-aged body hurts right now.
924,01:00:24.27,01:00:24.27,I'm just worn out. I don't have the energy.
925,01:00:26.67,01:00:26.67,I really don't have much of a spirit left.
926,01:00:28.50,01:00:28.50,And I know I need to get it together for tonight.
927,01:00:37.57,01:00:37.57,">> To this day, no one has ever put my name"
928,01:00:40.03,01:00:40.03,"on a piece of parchment. They write it tonight,"
929,01:00:42.83,01:00:42.83,"it's to give me the money. It'll be for a good reason,"
930,01:00:45.67,01:00:45.67,not for a bad reason. And that was one of my goals.
931,01:00:49.03,01:00:49.03,"Lill is a good person. So, I don't know why"
932,01:00:51.57,01:00:51.57,she doesn't deserve it more than I do
933,01:00:53.73,01:00:53.73,or why she does deserve it more than I do.
934,01:00:56.07,01:00:56.07,I hope I win a million dollars tonight.
935,01:00:58.53,01:00:58.53,I think I have a good chance. >> Thank you.
936,01:01:02.23,01:01:02.23,>> And it matches with your uniform.
937,01:01:03.80,01:01:03.80,I think that what this will come down to
938,01:01:05.87,01:01:05.87,is a three to four vote. It's going to be
939,01:01:08.43,01:01:08.43,"something real close. Lill, you look like a pirate."
940,01:01:13.53,01:01:13.53,"A Boy Scout pirate. >> Thank you, Lord."
941,01:01:16.43,01:01:16.43,"We're out of here. >> Hey, don't look back."
942,01:01:18.93,01:01:18.93,>> We got to look back. Stop. Stop!
943,01:01:22.73,01:01:22.73,"Bye, guys. It's been fun."
944,01:01:26.07,01:01:26.07,"You and me, sister. You and me."
945,01:01:28.27,01:01:28.27,>> That's right. >> Let's go knock them socks
946,01:01:30.97,01:01:30.97,off. >> Tonight's the final Tribal
947,01:01:58.07,01:01:58.07,"Council and we're going to be, uh, going ahead and voting"
948,01:02:01.07,01:02:01.07,for whoever gets the million dollars.
949,01:02:02.40,01:02:02.40,"It's pretty wild. I mean, it's the end"
950,01:02:05.33,01:02:05.33,of our journey. The most amazing thing
951,01:02:07.50,01:02:07.50,about tonight and having this kind of power is
952,01:02:10.33,01:02:10.33,I don't feel that good about it. It's a lot of pressure for
953,01:02:14.17,01:02:14.17,everybody to be able to give somebody a million dollars.
954,01:02:16.77,01:02:16.77,"It's just huge. It's like, you can"
955,01:02:18.57,01:02:18.57,cut through the air with a knife.
956,01:02:20.43,01:02:20.43,It's just... it's-it's amazing.
957,01:02:23.07,01:02:23.07,I want to be able to give somebody the money
958,01:02:25.47,01:02:25.47,that deserves it. You really need
959,01:02:28.07,01:02:28.07,to think about it. It's a-it's a huge deal
960,01:02:30.43,01:02:30.43,for one of these two people. >> I think that
961,01:02:39.37,01:02:39.37,"the pros to Lill is that, uh, she's definitely persevered, um,"
962,01:02:42.33,01:02:42.33,"over the course of the 39 days, um, I think, where people"
963,01:02:46.90,01:02:46.90,definitely doubted her and her ability
964,01:02:48.77,01:02:48.77,"to last this long. Um, she's also had"
965,01:02:50.73,01:02:50.73,"some good relationships, I think, with people."
966,01:02:53.60,01:02:53.60,One of the things that I actually admired about Sandra
967,01:02:55.93,01:02:55.93,"was she was so blatant, so honest."
968,01:02:57.73,01:02:57.73,"Like, wow, she was able to kind of be up front"
969,01:03:00.33,01:03:00.33,and stand her ground and she's still here.
970,01:03:02.83,01:03:02.83,"Whereas, other people did it and they were a threat"
971,01:03:04.73,01:03:04.73,and they were kicked off. >> Everyone in this game
972,01:03:09.70,01:03:09.70,has been deceitful. Everyone has stabbed people
973,01:03:12.13,01:03:12.13,"in the back, has gone against alliances."
974,01:03:15.33,01:03:15.33,But everyone knows it. I want Sandra and Lill
975,01:03:17.83,01:03:17.83,"to answer questions 100% honestly,"
976,01:03:21.13,01:03:21.13,giving honest assessment. If one of them does that
977,01:03:25.00,01:03:25.00,"significantly better than the other, they will"
978,01:03:26.90,01:03:26.90,"probably get my vote tonight. So, I want to see 100% honesty"
979,01:03:29.93,01:03:29.93,for the first time in this game. >> Here we are today
980,01:03:35.20,01:03:35.20,"with the two most unlikely people, I think,"
981,01:03:38.60,01:03:38.60,that I would have expected at the beginning of this game
982,01:03:41.30,01:03:41.30,"in, uh, the final two. Both of them were the underdogs"
983,01:03:45.57,01:03:45.57,in the very beginning of this game.
984,01:03:47.63,01:03:47.63,Sandra was the first person expected to be voted out
985,01:03:49.90,01:03:49.90,"of the Drake Tribe. And Lill, I think, was expected"
986,01:03:53.03,01:03:53.03,to be the first person voted out of the Morgan tribe.
987,01:03:55.57,01:03:55.57,So turns out that the two people that would have been
988,01:03:58.47,01:03:58.47,gone first have now made it to the very end.
989,01:04:05.53,01:04:05.53,">> Um, this is a good game. You know, there's good sides"
990,01:04:10.00,01:04:10.00,and bad sides. I'm just so emotional...
991,01:04:14.90,01:04:14.90,I'm just... getting voted out
992,01:04:16.30,01:04:16.30,that close to the very end. It's a good thing that I get
993,01:04:19.87,01:04:19.87,to get back and say something to-to let them know
994,01:04:22.17,01:04:22.17,"how I feel about them. You know, 'cause they"
995,01:04:24.70,01:04:24.70,"pretty much screwed me over. So, you know, it's a good thing"
996,01:04:27.90,01:04:27.90,that I get to say something back to them.
997,01:04:30.43,01:04:30.43,(sniffs) >> I would hope
998,01:04:35.80,01:04:35.80,that Lill and Sandra appreciate where they are.
999,01:04:39.83,01:04:39.83,"Win or lose, they should appreciate"
1000,01:04:41.70,01:04:41.70,the situation that they have been given...
1001,01:04:44.77,01:04:44.77,and earned. The significance of tonight
1002,01:04:46.83,01:04:46.83,is going to be life-changing for one person.
1003,01:04:51.77,01:04:51.77,A million dollars is going to be life-changing.
1004,01:04:54.87,01:04:54.87,"We are going to take one little housewife, one little mama,"
1005,01:04:58.60,01:04:58.60,"and make their lives, their husbands' lives"
1006,01:05:00.80,01:05:00.80,and their kids' lives different.
1007,01:05:07.83,01:05:07.83,>> I'm not happy about playing this game as well as I did
1008,01:05:10.50,01:05:10.50,and not being one of the final two.
1009,01:05:12.80,01:05:12.80,I feel that the strongest player in this game made it as far
1010,01:05:16.20,01:05:16.20,as he could make it in this game and that there are two people
1011,01:05:21.03,01:05:21.03,that don't deserve to be there. Jonny Fairplay is going to have
1012,01:05:25.00,01:05:25.00,a fun time at Tribal Council tonight.
1013,01:05:27.70,01:05:27.70,The one thing I can promise tonight
1014,01:05:29.17,01:05:29.17,"is that I won't play fair. >> PROBST: Sandra, Lill."
1015,01:06:05.83,01:06:05.83,We'll now bring in your final jury:
1016,01:06:07.77,01:06:07.77,"Ryno, Rupert, T, Christa, Burton,"
1017,01:06:15.17,01:06:15.17,"Darrah and Jon, voted out"
1018,01:06:18.77,01:06:18.77,at the last Tribal Council. Welcome to
1019,01:06:22.80,01:06:22.80,your final Tribal Council. Game changes tonight.
1020,01:06:28.03,01:06:28.03,You are no longer in control. The power now shifts
1021,01:06:31.47,01:06:31.47,to the jury. Seven people that you had a hand
1022,01:06:34.20,01:06:34.20,in voting out of this game now control your fate entirely.
1023,01:06:39.77,01:06:39.77,Your task tonight is to convince this jury
1024,01:06:42.60,01:06:42.60,"that you are the most worthy, the most deserving"
1025,01:06:46.03,01:06:46.03,of the title of Sole Survivor and the million dollar prize.
1026,01:06:49.27,01:06:49.27,Here's how it will work. Give you a chance to make
1027,01:06:52.10,01:06:52.10,an opening statement. This is your time to convince
1028,01:06:54.40,01:06:54.40,your jury that you're worthy. The jury will then get
1029,01:06:58.80,01:06:58.80,an opportunity to ask you a question.
1030,01:07:01.63,01:07:01.63,You'll then get a chance to make a final rebuttal.
1031,01:07:04.43,01:07:04.43,"After hearing your responses, the jury will vote."
1032,01:07:08.73,01:07:08.73,The biggest vote in the 39 days going to happen tonight.
1033,01:07:13.57,01:07:13.57,Ready to get started? >> Mm-hmm.
1034,01:07:15.80,01:07:15.80,>> PROBST: Sandra. Opening statement to the jury.
1035,01:07:17.93,01:07:17.93,">> Um, hello. I feel that I deserve the"
1036,01:07:23.40,01:07:23.40,"million dollars because, um, I was always a team player"
1037,01:07:27.30,01:07:27.30,from the get-go. And my strategy was
1038,01:07:29.83,01:07:29.83,always to be that person that anybody can
1039,01:07:31.70,01:07:31.70,"come to and say, ""Sandra, we need to"
1040,01:07:34.33,01:07:34.33,vote this person out so we can move forward
1041,01:07:36.07,01:07:36.07,"in-in the game."" And I feel that"
1042,01:07:37.77,01:07:37.77,"I accomplished that, because I was always"
1043,01:07:39.30,01:07:39.30,a team player. I helped out 100%.
1044,01:07:41.47,01:07:41.47,I gave 100%. Everyone could
1045,01:07:43.03,01:07:43.03,always count on me to have their backs
1046,01:07:45.33,01:07:45.33,"and to just always, you know, help out with"
1047,01:07:49.20,01:07:49.20,everything that had to be done. >> PROBST: Lill.
1048,01:07:53.77,01:07:53.77,>> My strategy from the very beginning
1049,01:07:55.40,01:07:55.40,was to just be Lillian Morris. Not only did my strategy
1050,01:07:59.20,01:07:59.20,"consist of trying to be kind to everyone,"
1051,01:08:01.17,01:08:01.17,because that's what Lillian is. Lillian is a kind person.
1052,01:08:04.57,01:08:04.57,"I worked constantly, you know, while everybody else was, uh,"
1053,01:08:08.63,01:08:08.63,"you know, maybe snoozing a little bit."
1054,01:08:10.10,01:08:10.10,"Um, three different people told me that,"
1055,01:08:14.83,01:08:14.83,"""Lill, we're going to take you to the final two with me."""
1056,01:08:18.50,01:08:18.50,"Turns out, all three of these people"
1057,01:08:20.53,01:08:20.53,kind of turned their back on me. They said I was too nice.
1058,01:08:23.57,01:08:23.57,"They wouldn't go up against me. I think, basically,"
1059,01:08:25.97,01:08:25.97,"my strategy was just to come in, work hard,"
1060,01:08:30.83,01:08:30.83,"be friendly, do good by others and just be Lillian."
1061,01:08:37.00,01:08:37.00,"And I think, uh, mostly, that's what I was."
1062,01:08:40.87,01:08:40.87,">> PROBST: Jury, in a moment, you're going to have"
1063,01:08:43.53,01:08:43.53,"a chance to address Sandra and Lill,"
1064,01:08:47.33,01:08:47.33,ask them a question that will help you decide
1065,01:08:49.27,01:08:49.27,who you think should be the Sole Survivor.
1066,01:08:51.27,01:08:51.27,Give you a second to think about
1067,01:08:53.30,01:08:53.30,"what you want to say. >> PROBST: All right, jury,"
1068,01:09:19.43,01:09:19.43,it is now your opportunity to either make a comment or ask
1069,01:09:23.00,01:09:23.00,a question of Sandra and Lill. The idea here
1070,01:09:26.97,01:09:26.97,is to gain information to help you make
1071,01:09:29.80,01:09:29.80,an important vote. So don't waste this opportunity.
1072,01:09:33.90,01:09:33.90,"Ryan, you're up first. >> Hey, guys."
1073,01:09:37.70,01:09:37.70,>> Hi. >> Congratulations.
1074,01:09:39.27,01:09:39.27,">> Thank you. >> You did very well,"
1075,01:09:40.93,01:09:40.93,"beat out the 14 of us. Um, first of all, Lill,"
1076,01:09:44.57,01:09:44.57,being out of the game for ten days
1077,01:09:47.13,01:09:47.13,"and you were in the game for only 29 days,"
1078,01:09:49.50,01:09:49.50,"my question is, do you think it's fair"
1079,01:09:52.00,01:09:52.00,that I give you the million dollars
1080,01:09:54.13,01:09:54.13,"over Sandra, being that she was in the game"
1081,01:09:57.00,01:09:57.00,for the total 39 days? >> All right.
1082,01:09:59.20,01:09:59.20,>> I was out of the game for eight days.
1083,01:10:01.73,01:10:01.73,"And that was one of the biggest, lowest points"
1084,01:10:04.07,01:10:04.07,"of... I hate to say of my life, but it was a really hard time."
1085,01:10:10.80,01:10:10.80,"Yeah, maybe I wasn't on the island with you."
1086,01:10:13.50,01:10:13.50,"But those eight days that I was out,"
1087,01:10:17.80,01:10:17.80,"it was no picnic being Outcasts. >> Sandra, to you, you've"
1088,01:10:21.53,01:10:21.53,"always been honest with me. But my question to you is,"
1089,01:10:26.23,01:10:26.23,do you think that you rode coattails
1090,01:10:28.83,01:10:28.83,"as far as, like, maybe... was there a person"
1091,01:10:31.77,01:10:31.77,"that you used to, you know, progress?"
1092,01:10:34.27,01:10:34.27,>> I never rode anyone's coattails.
1093,01:10:37.00,01:10:37.00,"Um, when I started in the game and I felt alone, um,"
1094,01:10:39.63,01:10:39.63,"Rupert was also alone, and I attached myself with him,"
1095,01:10:42.90,01:10:42.90,"and I attached myself with Christa,"
1096,01:10:44.73,01:10:44.73,"and we became an alliance. Um, and Rupert was gone early"
1097,01:10:48.30,01:10:48.30,"on, when it came to the jury. So when Rupert was gone,"
1098,01:10:51.10,01:10:51.10,"then whose coattails did I ride, if Rupert was no longer there?"
1099,01:10:54.13,01:10:54.13,"I don't feel I rode anybody's coattails,"
1100,01:10:56.20,01:10:56.20,because I'm still standing here. >> Okay.
1101,01:11:00.17,01:11:00.17,Satisfied. Sounds good.
1102,01:11:02.30,01:11:02.30,">> PROBST: All right. Thanks, Ryno."
1103,01:11:05.87,01:11:05.87,Rupert. >> (sighs)
1104,01:11:11.63,01:11:11.63,Congratulations to both of you. >> Thank you.
1105,01:11:13.57,01:11:13.57,">> Thank you, Rupert. >> I'm impressed"
1106,01:11:15.37,01:11:15.37,and proud of both of you. >> Thank you.
1107,01:11:17.33,01:11:17.33,">> You made it to the end. Um, to you, Lill..."
1108,01:11:21.30,01:11:21.30,"you know, I was that scout, too, when I was younger."
1109,01:11:24.80,01:11:24.80,I know the oath. I know the creed.
1110,01:11:26.43,01:11:26.43,I know how you're supposed to live as you're a scout.
1111,01:11:28.70,01:11:28.70,Saying that you're not going to live that way
1112,01:11:32.73,01:11:32.73,"because of this game, you know, or-or"
1113,01:11:34.77,01:11:34.77,using this game to-to kind of turn some of those things
1114,01:11:39.33,01:11:39.33,that you pledge off. I feel that aside from
1115,01:11:44.50,01:11:44.50,"the first day that we merged, everything that you said to me"
1116,01:11:49.53,01:11:49.53,was a lie. Everything that you said
1117,01:11:52.97,01:11:52.97,"was sucking me in so I would believe you,"
1118,01:11:57.13,01:11:57.13,"up until the day that I was... kicked out of this game,"
1119,01:12:00.93,01:12:00.93,you were still lying to me. Was there any time that you were
1120,01:12:06.37,01:12:06.37,"truthful with me? When? If there was, tell me anything"
1121,01:12:08.87,01:12:08.87,that you were truthful with me. Right now...
1122,01:12:12.00,01:12:12.00,>> Everything was honest until Burton came to me
1123,01:12:14.90,01:12:14.90,"and said, ""We need to get rid of Rupert."""
1124,01:12:17.70,01:12:17.70,">> Lill... >> Yes, sir."
1125,01:12:19.87,01:12:19.87,">> ""Everything was honest"" doesn't tell me anything."
1126,01:12:23.77,01:12:23.77,"You're blaming Burton for you... >> No, there's lots of things"
1127,01:12:27.17,01:12:27.17,that I was honest... >> Tell me one.
1128,01:12:29.70,01:12:29.70,>> When you and I were out in the water and we were talking.
1129,01:12:32.30,01:12:32.30,"We talked about our families, our lives,"
1130,01:12:35.33,01:12:35.33,our dedication to youth. That was all honest.
1131,01:12:39.70,01:12:39.70,That was all on the up-and-up. >> PROBST: I think that's all
1132,01:12:44.00,01:12:44.00,"you're going to get, Rupert. >> I think so, too."
1133,01:12:45.97,01:12:45.97,">> PROBST: Rupert, your question for Sandra."
1134,01:12:47.43,01:12:47.43,>> Sandra... the one question I have for you:
1135,01:12:50.40,01:12:50.40,"On day 27, when I was booted out of this game,"
1136,01:12:53.73,01:12:53.73,did you know that was going on? I just want to know
1137,01:12:57.00,01:12:57.00,"about that day. >> Okay. Um, that day, when the"
1138,01:12:59.97,01:12:59.97,"vote came through, um, I did not know"
1139,01:13:02.90,01:13:02.90,you were going home. I was mad at Jon--
1140,01:13:04.97,01:13:04.97,I don't know over what-- so I wrote
1141,01:13:06.87,01:13:06.87,"his name thinking, ""Well, it doesn't matter,"
1142,01:13:08.70,01:13:08.70,because everyone else is going to vote off Darrah.
1143,01:13:11.10,01:13:11.10,"So, my vote can go towards Jon and it won't make a difference."""
1144,01:13:13.93,01:13:13.93,"When I got back with Christa to the tribe,"
1145,01:13:16.43,01:13:16.43,"everything just blew up because I was cursing, mad,"
1146,01:13:18.83,01:13:18.83,"screaming, hollering, that, ""How could this"
1147,01:13:21.00,01:13:21.00,"have happened to Rupert?"" But I was not aware"
1148,01:13:23.20,01:13:23.20,"that you were going. But, remember, I"
1149,01:13:25.00,01:13:25.00,always told you: Jon is a snake. Something's going down.
1150,01:13:28.47,01:13:28.47,This is-this is not right. And what did you say?
1151,01:13:30.80,01:13:30.80,"""Drake all the way. We bleed Drake."
1152,01:13:33.10,01:13:33.10,"Alliance this, alliance that."" And look what happened."
1153,01:13:35.70,01:13:35.70,>> I know. >> Sounds good?
1154,01:13:38.57,01:13:38.57,>> Yes. >> I didn't know.
1155,01:13:40.93,01:13:40.93,>> Thank you. >> You're welcome.
1156,01:13:43.43,01:13:43.43,">> PROBST: Thanks, Rupert. T."
1157,01:13:51.70,01:13:51.70,">> Hello, ladies. >> Hello."
1158,01:13:53.37,01:13:53.37,">> And first of all, congratulations."
1159,01:13:55.13,01:13:55.13,I have one important question that will decipher
1160,01:13:58.20,01:13:58.20,who I would like to have win a million dollars.
1161,01:14:00.87,01:14:00.87,"My question is, give me one reason"
1162,01:14:03.60,01:14:03.60,why the other person does not deserve to win
1163,01:14:05.90,01:14:05.90,a million dollars and why you do.
1164,01:14:08.17,01:14:08.17,"And I'll start with you, Lill, first."
1165,01:14:10.67,01:14:10.67,">> Forgive me. >> No, you have to say"
1166,01:14:12.77,01:14:12.77,something bad about me. Go ahead.
1167,01:14:14.63,01:14:14.63,"(all laughing) >> Um, I felt that"
1168,01:14:18.83,01:14:18.83,"there was, at times, Sandra had disrespected"
1169,01:14:20.93,01:14:20.93,a number of people. I know a number of times
1170,01:14:25.47,01:14:25.47,"that she'd called me an ""M.F.-er"", and all this stuff."
1171,01:14:28.87,01:14:28.87,"Um, I felt that at a lot of times"
1172,01:14:32.47,01:14:32.47,that she did ride the coattails of other people--
1173,01:14:36.43,01:14:36.43,"that she would always say, ""You tell me what to do."""
1174,01:14:41.40,01:14:41.40,"And, at times, I wanted to, you know, say,"
1175,01:14:45.13,01:14:45.13,"""Well, do you have a mind of your own,"
1176,01:14:47.33,01:14:47.33,"and can you figure stuff out yourself?"""
1177,01:14:49.80,01:14:49.80,That's all I want to state. I'm not going to keep going.
1178,01:14:53.63,01:14:53.63,">> No, that's fine. Thank you. Sandra."
1179,01:14:56.53,01:14:56.53,>> One good reason: because Lill is responsible
1180,01:14:58.97,01:14:58.97,for every single person being out that's there.
1181,01:15:02.70,01:15:02.70,Every single one of you got a vote from Lill.
1182,01:15:06.90,01:15:06.90,"Christa, you didn't get my vote never."
1183,01:15:08.37,01:15:08.37,"I never put you out of the game. Rupert, I never put you"
1184,01:15:11.73,01:15:11.73,out of the game. Um... That's just one thing.
1185,01:15:14.97,01:15:14.97,"Because she is a hard worker, so the only thing"
1186,01:15:16.90,01:15:16.90,I can say is that everyone that's there is there
1187,01:15:19.37,01:15:19.37,because of Lill. >> Okay.
1188,01:15:22.87,01:15:22.87,>> PROBST: Satisfied? >> Yes. Thank you.
1189,01:15:24.67,01:15:24.67,>> PROBST: Good question. Christa.
1190,01:15:32.40,01:15:32.40,">> What's up, people? All right."
1191,01:15:35.17,01:15:35.17,Rock stars. Um...
1192,01:15:37.63,01:15:37.63,"Lill, first question for you. So, you always would say,"
1193,01:15:41.97,01:15:41.97,"""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" and..."
1194,01:15:45.33,01:15:45.33,"about everything. You'd win something,"
1195,01:15:46.73,01:15:46.73,"you'd say, ""I'm sorry."" And then two seconds later,"
1196,01:15:50.17,01:15:50.17,you'd start reciting your Boy Scout's Oath.
1197,01:15:52.50,01:15:52.50,"So, you always are hiding behind this"
1198,01:15:54.90,01:15:54.90,Boy Scout's Oath of yours. What's the reason for all of it?
1199,01:15:58.17,01:15:58.17,"What did you really want to say? >> All right, when did I say"
1200,01:16:01.30,01:16:01.30,I was sorry to you for something?
1201,01:16:03.57,01:16:03.57,">> Uh... ""I'm sorry about... voting Rupert out."""
1202,01:16:08.10,01:16:08.10,"""I'm sorry about... taking this reward."""
1203,01:16:11.20,01:16:11.20,"I mean, just, sorry all the time."
1204,01:16:13.17,01:16:13.17,">> On those two occasions, I was sincerely sorry."
1205,01:16:15.97,01:16:15.97,It took a lot out of me to vote Rupert out.
1206,01:16:18.47,01:16:18.47,But I felt like I had to follow my alliance on that.
1207,01:16:22.50,01:16:22.50,I did not hide behind the Oath all day long.
1208,01:16:25.97,01:16:25.97,It's 16 years of volunteering. It's something that I...
1209,01:16:29.77,01:16:29.77,I had no other clothes. I was in it.
1210,01:16:31.77,01:16:31.77,I was stuck in it. It was part of me.
1211,01:16:34.20,01:16:34.20,">> So, because of the clothes that you happened to be"
1212,01:16:36.20,01:16:36.20,wearing... >> Because of 16 years
1213,01:16:38.40,01:16:38.40,"of being in an organization that I volunteered in,"
1214,01:16:41.33,01:16:41.33,it was so much a part of me. The first time
1215,01:16:43.80,01:16:43.80,that I lied in this game was with Rupert.
1216,01:16:47.27,01:16:47.27,That was the very first time. And it made me realize
1217,01:16:51.60,01:16:51.60,"that if I didn't, I wouldn't stay in this game"
1218,01:16:54.20,01:16:54.20,for very long. >> So... I guess that's it?
1219,01:16:58.50,01:16:58.50,"Sandra, since I spent a lot of time with you,"
1220,01:17:01.97,01:17:01.97,I always would have the opportunity
1221,01:17:03.97,01:17:03.97,to hear these crazy ideas that you would come up with.
1222,01:17:06.47,01:17:06.47,"And you'd tell me, ""Just go with the plan."""
1223,01:17:08.20,01:17:08.20,"""Just sit there, Christa."" And not a lot of people"
1224,01:17:10.40,01:17:10.40,really knew that you would come up
1225,01:17:12.20,01:17:12.20,"with these crazy plans. So, I was wondering,"
1226,01:17:14.37,01:17:14.37,what is your most... challenging...
1227,01:17:18.97,01:17:18.97,plotting and scheming obstacle to keep yourself alive
1228,01:17:21.87,01:17:21.87,in this game? >> The craziest scheme
1229,01:17:24.20,01:17:24.20,was the one when me and Tijuana
1230,01:17:25.93,01:17:25.93,snuck behind the bushes and low-crawled through the
1231,01:17:29.17,01:17:29.17,dirt. It was then official
1232,01:17:31.10,01:17:31.10,that she was in an alliance with Jon and Burton
1233,01:17:34.90,01:17:34.90,"after she said that when she left the Morgan Tribe,"
1234,01:17:37.47,01:17:37.47,she was in an... in an alliance with the two Morgan females.
1235,01:17:41.53,01:17:41.53,>> All right. >> PROBST: Satisfied?
1236,01:17:44.53,01:17:44.53,">> Satisfied. >> PROBST: Thanks, Christa."
1237,01:17:47.27,01:17:47.27,"Burton, you're up. >> Sandra, Lill,"
1238,01:17:52.87,01:17:52.87,congratulations. >> Thank you.
1239,01:17:56.43,01:17:56.43,">> The game of ""Survivor"" entails two aspects, in my mind:"
1240,01:18:00.40,01:18:00.40,"the survival aspect-- being out in the wilderness,"
1241,01:18:03.63,01:18:03.63,self-sufficient or with your tribe--
1242,01:18:06.37,01:18:06.37,"and then a strategic aspect. I want to ask you,"
1243,01:18:08.90,01:18:08.90,"from a survival standpoint and your survival skills,"
1244,01:18:13.03,01:18:13.03,"on a scale of one to ten-- one being, ""If I were dropped"

1249,01:18:24.10,01:18:24.10,self-assessment. >> You go ahead.
1250,01:18:25.83,01:18:25.83,">> Okay. For me, if I would"
1251,01:18:27.67,01:18:27.67,have been dropped off in the same island
1252,01:18:30.17,01:18:30.17,"that we're in today, I think I would have done"
1253,01:18:33.13,01:18:33.13,"maybe a five, because of the simple fact"
1254,01:18:36.00,01:18:36.00,"that being in a tropical island,"
1255,01:18:37.67,01:18:37.67,"I kind of, sort of, knew what foods and fruits"
1256,01:18:40.83,01:18:40.83,"and things to look for. Now, when it comes to fire"
1257,01:18:43.33,01:18:43.33,"and stuff like that, I'm not the greatest."
1258,01:18:45.43,01:18:45.43,But I think I would have done good maybe for the first
1259,01:18:48.37,01:18:48.37,"couple of days, and then I'd probably just, I don't know,"
1260,01:18:51.47,01:18:51.47,starve to death. Because I wasn't going
1261,01:18:53.43,01:18:53.43,to eat the hermit crabs and... and stuff like that.
1262,01:18:56.57,01:18:56.57,"Five. >> Good answer, I appreciate"
1263,01:18:59.17,01:18:59.17,that. >> I think I would give myself a
1264,01:19:01.73,01:19:01.73,"seven, because I can make fire with no matches. Um..."
1265,01:19:06.77,01:19:06.77,"I am able to, uh, obtain water. These are skills, uh,"
1266,01:19:13.37,01:19:13.37,that I've learned as a Scout. I was diligent and
1267,01:19:17.80,01:19:17.80,constantly making sure that the Morgan Tribe
1268,01:19:22.50,01:19:22.50,"had fresh water at all times, and making sure it's boiled"
1269,01:19:27.27,01:19:27.27,"the full 30 minutes... >> Okay, okay."
1270,01:19:30.17,01:19:30.17,"Yeah, I think you... >> Okay. Got it?"
1271,01:19:31.93,01:19:31.93,>> I think I got it. >> Thank you.

1275,01:19:45.33,01:19:45.33,"I just want you to explain to me how both of you got here,"
1276,01:19:48.27,01:19:48.27,"and just give me an honest answer,"
1277,01:19:50.40,01:19:50.40,and whoever gives me the most honest answer will get my vote.
1278,01:19:53.70,01:19:53.70,">> To me, the reason I probably was able"
1279,01:19:56.23,01:19:56.23,to get to where I am now is because other people
1280,01:19:58.67,01:19:58.67,had other agendas. They had other fish to fry.
1281,01:20:00.80,01:20:00.80,Nobody worried about Sandra because Sandra was weak.
1282,01:20:03.27,01:20:03.27,"And, again, I was also the person that if someone needed"
1283,01:20:06.30,01:20:06.30,"that extra vote, I was there. As long as it wasn't me,"
1284,01:20:09.53,01:20:09.53,I was ready to give up whoever. I was just always there
1285,01:20:13.53,01:20:13.53,"to take advantage of the situation,"
1286,01:20:14.80,01:20:14.80,and let the vote go in a different direction
1287,01:20:17.07,01:20:17.07,than my way. >> I'm satisfied.
1288,01:20:19.90,01:20:19.90,>> PROBST: Lill. >> I am a... non-threat
1289,01:20:23.40,01:20:23.40,"because... you know, I was older, non-athletic."
1290,01:20:28.40,01:20:28.40,"Yes, I did follow certain alliances,"
1291,01:20:32.37,01:20:32.37,and I broke away from that alliance
1292,01:20:34.60,01:20:34.60,and went with the someone else in order to protect that person.
1293,01:20:39.33,01:20:39.33,"So, I think I'm here because... Some of it is following along,"
1294,01:20:44.63,01:20:44.63,some of it is using my own head and doing something on my own.
1295,01:20:48.10,01:20:48.10,>> PROBST: Satisfied? >> Satisfied.

1298,01:20:59.27,01:20:59.27,interesting to say. >> My question is for Jeff.
1299,01:21:02.03,01:21:02.03,"Can I vote ""none of the above""? (laughs)"
1300,01:21:06.33,01:21:06.33,"Uh... My question is, uh..."
1301,01:21:11.37,01:21:11.37,Some people were able to represent themselves
1302,01:21:13.87,01:21:13.87,"and other things in this game, and a real case-in-point"
1303,01:21:16.27,01:21:16.27,"is the two of you. For Sandra, I think you..."
1304,01:21:19.87,01:21:19.87,you made an attempt to represent Puerto Ricans.
1305,01:21:22.97,01:21:22.97,How do you feel you did wearing that...
1306,01:21:25.43,01:21:25.43,that dual badge of honor? >> I think I did a good job
1307,01:21:28.27,01:21:28.27,out here. You know what I'm saying?
1308,01:21:30.13,01:21:30.13,I didn't do anything that anybody else didn't do.
1309,01:21:32.73,01:21:32.73,"If I lied, everyone else lied, too."
1310,01:21:34.63,01:21:34.63,"If I backstabbed somebody, I was backstabbed myself."
1311,01:21:37.57,01:21:37.57,"So, I just took care of myself. And that's where I get it from,"
1312,01:21:41.67,01:21:41.67,"maybe because I'm Puerto Rican, that I know that if I don't"
1313,01:21:45.10,01:21:45.10,"look out for number one, ain't nobody going"
1314,01:21:46.80,01:21:46.80,"to look out for me. Keep going, or that's good?"
1315,01:21:49.23,01:21:49.23,>> I'm totally happy with that. >> Okay.
1316,01:21:51.93,01:21:51.93,>> Lill. You had the opportunity
1317,01:21:53.47,01:21:53.47,to represent yourself and to represent
1318,01:21:56.10,01:21:56.10,the Boy Scouts. There were several periods
1319,01:21:58.23,01:21:58.23,in the game in which you made a promise to me.
1320,01:22:01.77,01:22:01.77,Didn't quite live up to one of those duties:
1321,01:22:05.27,01:22:05.27,truthfulness. How do you feel that
1322,01:22:07.73,01:22:07.73,you've represented the Scouts and represented that uniform?
1323,01:22:10.17,01:22:10.17,">> If I had it to do over again, I would not be wearing"
1324,01:22:13.40,01:22:13.40,this uniform. I would not be representing
1325,01:22:15.33,01:22:15.33,the Scouts. This game has nothing to do
1326,01:22:17.47,01:22:17.47,"with honor, integrity... it has nothing to do"
1327,01:22:22.40,01:22:22.40,with what the Scout Oath is and what the Scouts represent.
1328,01:22:27.93,01:22:27.93,"You know, I was still in my little world"
1329,01:22:30.37,01:22:30.37,of being back home being the Scout Master.
1330,01:22:33.43,01:22:33.43,"And then, again, I had to switch modes"
1331,01:22:36.07,01:22:36.07,and be the S.O.B. that voted off Rupert.
1332,01:22:41.13,01:22:41.13,"I wasn't happy about it, and, no, I did not represent"
1333,01:22:44.17,01:22:44.17,"the Scouts very well at all. >> PROBST: Thanks, Jon."
1334,01:22:47.87,01:22:47.87,">> Thank you. >> PROBST: Sandra, Lill, you"
1335,01:22:52.57,01:22:52.57,have weathered the questions and comments from the jury.
1336,01:22:56.07,01:22:56.07,"In a moment, I'll give you a chance to make a final rebuttal."
1337,01:22:59.50,01:22:59.50,I suggest you take this time to think about your last words.
1338,01:23:30.77,01:23:30.77,">> PROBST: Okay, Lill, Sandra, this is your last chance"
1339,01:23:35.17,01:23:35.17,to get at the core of why you deserve the million dollars.
1340,01:23:39.87,01:23:39.87,"So, Sandra, let's start with you."
1341,01:23:43.13,01:23:43.13,">> Um, I think I played this game the way I knew how."
1342,01:23:47.37,01:23:47.37,"Um, when I came here, I represented myself"
1343,01:23:50.50,01:23:50.50,the way that I truly am. There was no lies or deceptions
1344,01:23:54.17,01:23:54.17,about how Sandra is. I always thought that my mouth
1345,01:23:57.57,01:23:57.57,"would get me in trouble, but now that I look at it,"
1346,01:24:00.80,01:24:00.80,being open and-and saying things
1347,01:24:02.13,01:24:02.13,"the way they are is what, I think, helped me"
1348,01:24:05.17,01:24:05.17,"to get this far. Um, because whenever anyone"
1349,01:24:07.30,01:24:07.30,"approached me and said, ""Sandra, we need to do this"
1350,01:24:10.43,01:24:10.43,"this way,"" or whatever, I openly and frankly"
1351,01:24:12.90,01:24:12.90,"expressed my opinion, ""Yes, I'll help you,"" or"
1352,01:24:16.03,01:24:16.03,"""Yes, I'll go with you."" Um, I am, actually,"
1353,01:24:18.93,01:24:18.93,"surprised to be sitting here. But now that I am,"
1354,01:24:22.20,01:24:22.20,"I'm kind of glad. Um, I think I'm a good person,"
1355,01:24:25.47,01:24:25.47,regardless if I cussed you out or not.
1356,01:24:27.17,01:24:27.17,That's how I was feeling at the time.
1357,01:24:28.83,01:24:28.83,"Um, there's no regrets about whatever I did,"
1358,01:24:31.83,01:24:31.83,"and I'm glad to be sitting here, and that's all I can say."
1359,01:24:34.33,01:24:34.33,Thank you very much for your time.
1360,01:24:36.10,01:24:36.10,">> PROBST: Lill, last chance to convince the jury"
1361,01:24:38.63,01:24:38.63,to give you a million dollars. >> If I had this
1362,01:24:41.03,01:24:41.03,"to do all over again, the Boy Scout uniform"
1363,01:24:43.50,01:24:43.50,would have been at home. It's easy target
1364,01:24:46.47,01:24:46.47,"for anybody to say, ""Boy Scouts: ""dignity, honor. Survivor: liar,"
1365,01:24:52.00,01:24:52.00,"cheater,"" whatever. Two things don't come together."
1366,01:24:57.30,01:24:57.30,"And whatever you guys say about my honor, my integrity..."
1367,01:25:00.47,01:25:00.47,"it's bull ... It's that way, here."
1368,01:25:05.40,01:25:05.40,"It's not that way home. Now, why you should give it to"
1369,01:25:10.03,01:25:10.03,"me and not give it to Sandra? I also tried to learn this game,"
1370,01:25:15.67,01:25:15.67,play this game as best I could. I also tried to remain
1371,01:25:19.33,01:25:19.33,"respectful to people, and I also tried"
1372,01:25:22.00,01:25:22.00,"to form friendships. Friendships dissolved,"
1373,01:25:25.37,01:25:25.37,"and it hurt me bad, because I couldn't do anything about it."
1374,01:25:29.30,01:25:29.30,"You either play the game, or you get voted out."
1375,01:25:33.47,01:25:33.47,"So no matter what you guys do, I did the best I could"
1376,01:25:37.13,01:25:37.13,with what I had... and the person that I am.
1377,01:25:40.23,01:25:40.23,"And, like, this is one night. Yeah, it's a big reward,"
1378,01:25:44.73,01:25:44.73,but I'm going back home. I'm gonna be the Big Lill
1379,01:25:47.50,01:25:47.50,to 75 kids that look up to me. And I'm going to explain to them
1380,01:25:52.07,01:25:52.07,that this was a game. Put the Scout uniform aside.
1381,01:25:56.40,01:25:56.40,"I wish I had, and I didn't. Thank you."
1382,01:26:01.83,01:26:01.83,">> PROBST: Okay, Lill, Sandra, thank you for your comments."
1383,01:26:06.70,01:26:06.70,"Jury, thank you for your questions and comments."
1384,01:26:08.37,01:26:08.37,"It is now time, finally, to get to the vote."
1385,01:26:13.20,01:26:13.20,Voting is a little different tonight.
1386,01:26:14.53,01:26:14.53,You are not voting somebody out of the game.
1387,01:26:17.60,01:26:17.60,You are voting for a winner. You are voting for the person
1388,01:26:21.40,01:26:21.40,that you think is most deserving the title of Sole Survivor
1389,01:26:24.93,01:26:24.93,"and the million dollars, so you want"
1390,01:26:26.73,01:26:26.73,to see your name on the parchment tonight.
1391,01:26:31.03,01:26:31.03,"It is time to vote-- Ryno, you're up."
1392,01:27:15.80,01:27:15.80,Sandra... I am so happy for you.
1393,01:27:20.93,01:27:20.93,"You deserve it. From the first day, when we"
1394,01:27:24.03,01:27:24.03,"were blood brother and sister, I was just thrilled to have"
1395,01:27:27.40,01:27:27.40,somebody on my side. I'm glad I can be there
1396,01:27:31.83,01:27:31.83,for you now. I hope you win.
1397,01:28:22.33,01:28:22.33,">> Sandra, I couldn't understand if your strategy in the game,"
1398,01:28:26.20,01:28:26.20,"um, began, um, during the very first day,"
1399,01:28:29.47,01:28:29.47,"or if it was by luck that you got into the right alliance,"
1400,01:28:32.13,01:28:32.13,"and you decided to be up front, so, with that"
1401,01:28:34.27,01:28:34.27,"being said, I had to look at who played the game,"
1402,01:28:36.87,01:28:36.87,"regardless of Tribal Council, um, to the best"
1403,01:28:39.60,01:28:39.60,"of their ability. Lill, I think"
1404,01:28:41.03,01:28:41.03,"that you did a phenomenal job.  Um, you came in the Outcasts,"
1405,01:28:43.90,01:28:43.90, and you came back in the game.  And I think that you started
1406,01:28:47.03,01:28:47.03," to play it by using your mind.  So, with that being said,"
1407,01:28:49.77,01:28:49.77,"this vote goes to you, Lill. >> PROBST: For the last time,"
1408,01:29:07.17,01:29:07.17,I'll go tally the votes. I know you'd like me
1409,01:29:44.80,01:29:44.80,to read these right now and get this over with.
1410,01:29:46.77,01:29:46.77,"Been out here a damn long time. Unfortunately, it's going"
1411,01:29:49.83,01:29:49.83,to have to wait. I will see you
1412,01:29:52.40,01:29:52.40,"on the other side. (applause, cheering )"
1413,01:30:33.07,01:30:33.07,(cheering intensifies ) Guys.
1414,01:30:52.73,01:30:52.73,"(applause, cheering continue ) All right."
1415,01:31:02.83,01:31:02.83,Let's get to it. Who'd have ever thought this:
1416,01:31:05.60,01:31:05.60,Mrs. As-long-as-it-ain't-me and Mrs. I'm-too-nice
1417,01:31:07.97,01:31:07.97,sitting in the final two? Congratulations.
1418,01:31:11.80,01:31:11.80,>> Thank you. >> Thank you.
1419,01:31:13.17,01:31:13.17,">> PROBST: Jury, thanks for a very good"
1420,01:31:15.00,01:31:15.00,final Tribal Council. Let's get to the votes.
1421,01:31:16.97,01:31:16.97,"Like I said earlier, you want to see your name"
1422,01:31:19.77,01:31:19.77,"on the parchment tonight. Tonight, the jury"
1423,01:31:22.33,01:31:22.33,did not vote somebody out. They voted for a winner.
1424,01:31:26.33,01:31:26.33,Here's what's at stake for the winner:
1425,01:31:28.20,01:31:28.20,"bragging rights as winner of Survivor: Pearl Islands,"
1426,01:31:31.50,01:31:31.50,"a new G.M.C. Envoy S.U.V. to drive around in,"
1427,01:31:35.23,01:31:35.23,and a little check for a million dollars.
1428,01:31:37.90,01:31:37.90,There are seven votes inside here.
1429,01:31:40.13,01:31:40.13,It takes four votes to win. I'll read the votes.
1430,01:31:49.87,01:31:49.87,First vote... Sandra.
