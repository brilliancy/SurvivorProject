199,00:12:28.33,00:12:32.70,(sobbing)>> Lill went into such theatrics
200,00:12:32.70,00:12:35.17,"over her letter,that it pretty much overshadowed"
201,00:12:35.17,00:12:39.20,anyone else's letter.(moans)
202,00:12:39.20,00:12:41.60,That's been her M.O. from thebeginning.
203,00:12:41.60,00:12:43.80,"Of course, Lillwill break down into hysterics"
204,00:12:43.80,00:12:46.67,"and I hope to use that againsther, hopefully, to show D."

206,00:12:49.83,00:12:54.77,"you're screwed.So, have you guys made"
207,00:12:54.77,00:12:59.30,a deal amongst yourselvesfor final three?
208,00:12:59.30,00:13:05.23,"You can be honest.I take that as a ""yes."""
209,00:13:05.23,00:13:07.50,It is my head on the choppingblock.
210,00:13:07.50,00:13:10.03,It seems pretty obvious that...that the three of them have
211,00:13:10.03,00:13:12.30,"formed some kind of bondbecause, you know, all three"
212,00:13:12.30,00:13:15.80,share inferiority complexesto that of a man.

248,00:14:44.27,00:14:47.40,"Nobody wants to goto the jury with me,"
249,00:14:47.40,00:14:50.83,'cause they think I'm nice.They all think I'm going to get

263,00:15:28.37,00:15:30.20,Lill is only looking outfor herself.
264,00:15:30.20,00:15:33.23,She's being selfish. She...all she wants is to win
265,00:15:33.23,00:15:34.93,just like everybody else.And she thinks everybody
266,00:15:34.93,00:15:37.27,"should take her to the end,because she knows that"
267,00:15:37.27,00:15:40.23,"she would whip our tails.>> Okay, so, if Jon was"
268,00:15:40.23,00:15:43.00,"to win Immunity tonight,then it would be Lill?"
269,00:15:43.00,00:15:45.50,>> I think if...even if he doesn't win.

273,00:15:53.17,00:15:56.07,"to go into the Final Two.""So, now, she's thinking Jon."
274,00:15:56.07,00:15:58.10,Fine.It could be Lill
275,00:15:58.10,00:16:02.13,"as long as it's not me.I come back, Darrah takes off."
276,00:16:02.13,00:16:04.97,"Now, Lill comes to mewith her own strategy."
277,00:16:04.97,00:16:06.33,>> Can I... talk?>> What do you need?
278,00:16:06.33,00:16:09.97,>> I want to talk to you withoutears here.

282,00:16:26.23,00:16:30.33,"We have a better shot atImmunity the next time around,"
283,00:16:30.33,00:16:32.80,"physically, 'cause I can't doit."
284,00:16:32.80,00:16:35.10,>> If she wasn't there?>> If she wasn't there.

299,00:17:12.90,00:17:14.90,I can accept that.>> You'll accept that?

303,00:17:20.90,00:17:22.90,those two people's headsusually end up

305,00:17:25.00,00:17:28.67,it's either D. or Lill.Isn't that crazy?

307,00:17:32.33,00:17:34.73,"if either Darrah or Lillwins Immunity,"
308,00:17:34.73,00:17:37.33,then the other one goes.I really don't give a damn
309,00:17:37.33,00:17:41.33,"which one of the two goes,as long as it ain't me."
310,00:17:53.47,00:17:56.80,>> Got sea mail!>> Come this way.

332,00:19:35.90,00:19:38.60,the sixth member of the jury.But before we get
333,00:19:38.60,00:19:40.63,"to Tribal Council,we have an Immunity Challenge"
334,00:19:40.63,00:19:42.50,"to take care of.So, Darrah,"
335,00:19:42.50,00:19:50.23,"need to get that back.Immunity is back up for grabs,"
336,00:19:50.23,00:19:53.40,and tonightit truly is up for grabs.

338,00:19:56.57,00:20:00.57,will play a role in this game.Here's how it's going to work.
339,00:20:00.57,00:20:04.63,The four of you will competeas individuals for Immunity.
340,00:20:04.63,00:20:09.17,"In addition, the jurywill compete as a group"

343,00:20:15.73,00:20:17.53,"a huge consequence to you,because nobody"
344,00:20:17.53,00:20:20.40,will have Immunitywhen we go into
345,00:20:20.40,00:20:24.60,"tonight's Tribal Council.And, as many"

946,01:01:58.07,01:02:01.07,"Council and we're going to be,uh, going ahead and voting"
947,01:02:01.07,01:02:02.40,for whoever getsthe million dollars.
948,01:02:02.40,01:02:05.33,"It's pretty wild.I mean, it's the end"
949,01:02:05.33,01:02:07.50,of our journey.The most amazing thing
950,01:02:07.50,01:02:10.33,about tonightand having this kind of power is
951,01:02:10.33,01:02:14.17,I don't feel that good about it.It's a lot of pressure for
952,01:02:14.17,01:02:16.77,everybody to be able to givesomebody a million dollars.
953,01:02:16.77,01:02:18.57,"It's just huge.It's like, you can"
954,01:02:18.57,01:02:20.43,cut through the airwith a knife.
955,01:02:20.43,01:02:23.07,It's just...it's-it's amazing.
956,01:02:23.07,01:02:25.47,I want to be able to givesomebody the money
957,01:02:25.47,01:02:28.07,that deserves it.You really need
958,01:02:28.07,01:02:30.43,to think about it.It's a-it's a huge deal
959,01:02:30.43,01:02:39.37,for one of these two people.>> I think that
960,01:02:39.37,01:02:42.33,"the pros to Lill is that, uh,she's definitely persevered, um,"
961,01:02:42.33,01:02:46.90,"over the course of the 39 days,um, I think, where people"
962,01:02:46.90,01:02:48.77,definitely doubted herand her ability
963,01:02:48.77,01:02:50.73,"to last this long.Um, she's also had"
964,01:02:50.73,01:02:53.60,"some good relationships,I think, with people."
965,01:02:53.60,01:02:55.93,One of the things thatI actually admired about Sandra
966,01:02:55.93,01:02:57.73,"was she was so blatant,so honest."
967,01:02:57.73,01:03:00.33,"Like, wow, she wasable to kind of be up front"
968,01:03:00.33,01:03:02.83,and stand her groundand she's still here.
969,01:03:02.83,01:03:04.73,"Whereas, other people did itand they were a threat"
970,01:03:04.73,01:03:09.70,and they were kicked off.>> Everyone in this game
971,01:03:09.70,01:03:12.13,has been deceitful.Everyone has stabbed people
972,01:03:12.13,01:03:15.33,"in the back,has gone against alliances."
973,01:03:15.33,01:03:17.83,But everyone knows it.I want Sandra and Lill
974,01:03:17.83,01:03:21.13,"to answer questions100% honestly,"
975,01:03:21.13,01:03:25.00,giving honest assessment.If one of them does that
976,01:03:25.00,01:03:26.90,"significantly betterthan the other, they will"
977,01:03:26.90,01:03:29.93,"probably get my vote tonight.So, I want to see 100% honesty"
978,01:03:29.93,01:03:35.20,for the first time in this game.>> Here we are today
979,01:03:35.20,01:03:38.60,"with the two mostunlikely people, I think,"
980,01:03:38.60,01:03:41.30,that I would have expectedat the beginning of this game
981,01:03:41.30,01:03:45.57,"in, uh, the final two.Both of them were the underdogs"
982,01:03:45.57,01:03:47.63,in the very beginningof this game.
983,01:03:47.63,01:03:49.90,Sandra was the first personexpected to be voted out
984,01:03:49.90,01:03:53.03,"of the Drake Tribe.And Lill, I think, was expected"
985,01:03:53.03,01:03:55.57,to be the first personvoted out of the Morgan tribe.
986,01:03:55.57,01:03:58.47,So turns out that the twopeople that would have been
987,01:03:58.47,01:04:03.37,gone first have now made itto the very end.
988,01:04:05.53,01:04:10.00,">> Um, this is a good game.You know, there's good sides"
989,01:04:10.00,01:04:14.90,and bad sides.I'm just so emotional...
990,01:04:14.90,01:04:16.30,I'm just...getting voted out
991,01:04:16.30,01:04:19.87,that close to the very end.It's a good thing that I get
992,01:04:19.87,01:04:22.17,to get back and say somethingto-to let them know
993,01:04:22.17,01:04:24.70,"how I feel about them.You know, 'cause they"
994,01:04:24.70,01:04:27.90,"pretty much screwed me over.So, you know, it's a good thing"
995,01:04:27.90,01:04:30.43,that I get to saysomething back to them.
996,01:04:30.43,01:04:35.80,(sniffs)>> I would hope
997,01:04:35.80,01:04:39.83,that Lill and Sandraappreciate where they are.
998,01:04:39.83,01:04:41.70,"Win or lose,they should appreciate"
999,01:04:41.70,01:04:44.77,the situationthat they have been given...
1000,01:04:44.77,01:04:46.83,and earned.The significance of tonight
1001,01:04:46.83,01:04:51.77,is going to belife-changing for one person.
1002,01:04:51.77,01:04:54.87,A million dollarsis going to be life-changing.
1003,01:04:54.87,01:04:58.60,"We are going to take one littlehousewife, one little mama,"
1004,01:04:58.60,01:05:00.80,"and make their lives,their husbands' lives"
1005,01:05:00.80,01:05:07.83,and their kids' livesdifferent.
1006,01:05:07.83,01:05:10.50,>> I'm not happy about playingthis game as well as I did
1007,01:05:10.50,01:05:12.80,and not beingone of the final two.
1008,01:05:12.80,01:05:16.20,I feel that the strongest playerin this game made it as far
1009,01:05:16.20,01:05:21.03,as he could make it in this gameand that there are two people
1010,01:05:21.03,01:05:25.00,that don't deserve to be there.Jonny Fairplay is going to have
1011,01:05:25.00,01:05:27.70,a fun timeat Tribal Council tonight.
1012,01:05:27.70,01:05:29.17,The one thingI can promise tonight
1013,01:05:29.17,01:06:05.83,"is that I won't play fair.>> PROBST: Sandra, Lill."

1019,01:06:28.03,01:06:31.47,You are no longer in control.The power now shifts
1020,01:06:31.47,01:06:34.20,to the jury.Seven people that you had a hand

1022,01:06:39.77,01:06:42.60,Your task tonight isto convince this jury
1023,01:06:42.60,01:06:46.03,"that you are the most worthy,the most deserving"
1024,01:06:46.03,01:06:49.27,of the title of Sole Survivorand the million dollar prize.
1025,01:06:49.27,01:06:52.10,Here's how it will work.Give you a chance to make
1026,01:06:52.10,01:06:54.40,an opening statement.This is your time to convince
1027,01:06:54.40,01:06:58.80,your jury that you're worthy.The jury will then get
1028,01:06:58.80,01:07:01.63,an opportunityto ask you a question.
1029,01:07:01.63,01:07:04.43,You'll then get a chanceto make a final rebuttal.
1030,01:07:04.43,01:07:08.73,"After hearing your responses,the jury will vote."
1031,01:07:08.73,01:07:13.57,The biggest vote in the 39 daysgoing to happen tonight.

1033,01:07:15.80,01:07:17.93,>> PROBST: Sandra.Opening statement to the jury.
1034,01:07:17.93,01:07:23.40,">> Um, hello.I feel that I deserve the"
1035,01:07:23.40,01:07:27.30,"million dollars because, um,I was always a team player"
1036,01:07:27.30,01:07:29.83,from the get-go.And my strategy was
1037,01:07:29.83,01:07:31.70,always to be that personthat anybody can
1038,01:07:31.70,01:07:34.33,"come to and say,""Sandra, we need to"
1039,01:07:34.33,01:07:36.07,vote this person outso we can move forward
1040,01:07:36.07,01:07:37.77,"in-in the game.""And I feel that"
1041,01:07:37.77,01:07:39.30,"I accomplished that,because I was always"
1042,01:07:39.30,01:07:41.47,a team player.I helped out 100%.
1043,01:07:41.47,01:07:43.03,I gave 100%.Everyone could
1044,01:07:43.03,01:07:45.33,always count on meto have their backs
1045,01:07:45.33,01:07:49.20,"and to just always,you know, help out with"
1046,01:07:49.20,01:07:53.77,everything that had to be done.>> PROBST: Lill.
1047,01:07:53.77,01:07:55.40,>> My strategyfrom the very beginning
1048,01:07:55.40,01:07:59.20,was to just be Lillian Morris.Not only did my strategy
1049,01:07:59.20,01:08:01.17,"consist of tryingto be kind to everyone,"
1050,01:08:01.17,01:08:04.57,because that's what Lillian is.Lillian is a kind person.
1051,01:08:04.57,01:08:08.63,"I worked constantly, you know,while everybody else was, uh,"
1052,01:08:08.63,01:08:10.10,"you know, maybe snoozinga little bit."
1053,01:08:10.10,01:08:14.83,"Um, three different peopletold me that,"
1054,01:08:14.83,01:08:18.50,"""Lill, we're going to take youto the final two with me."""
1055,01:08:18.50,01:08:20.53,"Turns out, all threeof these people"
1056,01:08:20.53,01:08:23.57,kind of turned their back on me.They said I was too nice.
1057,01:08:23.57,01:08:25.97,"They wouldn't go up against me.I think, basically,"
1058,01:08:25.97,01:08:30.83,"my strategy wasjust to come in, work hard,"
1059,01:08:30.83,01:08:37.00,"be friendly, do good by othersand just be Lillian."
1060,01:08:37.00,01:08:40.87,"And I think, uh, mostly,that's what I was."
1061,01:08:40.87,01:08:43.53,">> PROBST: Jury, in a moment,you're going to have"
1062,01:08:43.53,01:08:47.33,"a chance to addressSandra and Lill,"
1063,01:08:47.33,01:08:49.27,ask them a questionthat will help you decide
1064,01:08:49.27,01:08:51.27,who you think should bethe Sole Survivor.
1065,01:08:51.27,01:08:53.30,Give you a secondto think about
1066,01:08:53.30,01:09:19.43,"what you want to say.>> PROBST: All right, jury,"
1067,01:09:19.43,01:09:23.00,it is now your opportunityto either make a comment or ask
1068,01:09:23.00,01:09:26.97,a question of Sandra and Lill.The idea here
1069,01:09:26.97,01:09:29.80,is to gain informationto help you make
1070,01:09:29.80,01:09:33.90,an important vote.So don't waste this opportunity.
1071,01:09:33.90,01:09:37.70,"Ryan, you're up first.>> Hey, guys."
1072,01:09:37.70,01:09:39.27,>> Hi.>> Congratulations.
1073,01:09:39.27,01:09:40.93,">> Thank you.>> You did very well,"
1074,01:09:40.93,01:09:44.57,"beat out the 14 of us.Um, first of all, Lill,"
1075,01:09:44.57,01:09:47.13,being out of the gamefor ten days
1076,01:09:47.13,01:09:49.50,"and you were in the gamefor only 29 days,"
1077,01:09:49.50,01:09:52.00,"my question is,do you think it's fair"
1078,01:09:52.00,01:09:54.13,that I give youthe million dollars
1079,01:09:54.13,01:09:57.00,"over Sandra, being thatshe was in the game"
1080,01:09:57.00,01:09:59.20,for the total 39 days?>> All right.
1081,01:09:59.20,01:10:01.73,>> I was out of the gamefor eight days.
1082,01:10:01.73,01:10:04.07,"And that was one of thebiggest, lowest points"
1083,01:10:04.07,01:10:10.80,"of... I hate to say of my life,but it was a really hard time."
1084,01:10:10.80,01:10:13.50,"Yeah, maybe I wasn'ton the island with you."
1085,01:10:13.50,01:10:17.80,"But those eight daysthat I was out,"
1086,01:10:17.80,01:10:21.53,"it was no picnic being Outcasts.>> Sandra, to you, you've"
1087,01:10:21.53,01:10:26.23,"always been honest with me.But my question to you is,"
1088,01:10:26.23,01:10:28.83,do you thinkthat you rode coattails
1089,01:10:28.83,01:10:31.77,"as far as, like, maybe...was there a person"
1090,01:10:31.77,01:10:34.27,"that you used to,you know, progress?"
1091,01:10:34.27,01:10:37.00,>> I never rode anyone'scoattails.
1092,01:10:37.00,01:10:39.63,"Um, when I started in the gameand I felt alone, um,"
1093,01:10:39.63,01:10:42.90,"Rupert was also alone,and I attached myself with him,"
1094,01:10:42.90,01:10:44.73,"and I attached myselfwith Christa,"
1095,01:10:44.73,01:10:48.30,"and we became an alliance.Um, and Rupert was gone early"
1096,01:10:48.30,01:10:51.10,"on, when it came to the jury.So when Rupert was gone,"
1097,01:10:51.10,01:10:54.13,"then whose coattails did I ride,if Rupert was no longer there?"
1098,01:10:54.13,01:10:56.20,"I don't feel I rodeanybody's coattails,"
1099,01:10:56.20,01:11:00.17,because I'm still standing here.>> Okay.
1100,01:11:00.17,01:11:02.30,Satisfied.Sounds good.
1101,01:11:02.30,01:11:05.87,">> PROBST: All right.Thanks, Ryno."
1102,01:11:05.87,01:11:11.63,Rupert.>> (sighs)

1107,01:11:21.30,01:11:24.80,"you know, I was that scout, too,when I was younger."
1108,01:11:24.80,01:11:26.43,I know the oath.I know the creed.
1109,01:11:26.43,01:11:28.70,I know how you're supposedto live as you're a scout.
1110,01:11:28.70,01:11:32.73,Saying that you're notgoing to live that way
1111,01:11:32.73,01:11:34.77,"because of this game,you know, or-or"
1112,01:11:34.77,01:11:39.33,using this game to-to kind ofturn some of those things
1113,01:11:39.33,01:11:44.50,that you pledge off.I feel that aside from
1114,01:11:44.50,01:11:49.53,"the first day that we merged,everything that you said to me"
1115,01:11:49.53,01:11:52.97,was a lie.Everything that you said
1116,01:11:52.97,01:11:57.13,"was sucking me inso I would believe you,"
1117,01:11:57.13,01:12:00.93,"up until the day that I was...kicked out of this game,"
1118,01:12:00.93,01:12:06.37,you were still lying to me.Was there any time that you were
1119,01:12:06.37,01:12:08.87,"truthful with me? When?If there was, tell me anything"
1120,01:12:08.87,01:12:12.00,that you were truthful with me.Right now...

1126,01:12:27.17,01:12:29.70,that I was honest...>> Tell me one.
1127,01:12:29.70,01:12:32.30,>> When you and I were out inthe water and we were talking.
1128,01:12:32.30,01:12:35.33,"We talked aboutour families, our lives,"
1129,01:12:35.33,01:12:39.70,our dedication to youth.That was all honest.
1130,01:12:39.70,01:12:44.00,That was all on the up-and-up.>> PROBST: I think that's all

1134,01:12:50.40,01:12:53.73,"On day 27, when I wasbooted out of this game,"
1135,01:12:53.73,01:12:57.00,did you know that was going on?I just want to know
1136,01:12:57.00,01:12:59.97,"about that day.>> Okay. Um, that day, when the"
1137,01:12:59.97,01:13:02.90,"vote came through, um,I did not know"
1138,01:13:02.90,01:13:04.97,you were going home.I was mad at Jon--
1139,01:13:04.97,01:13:06.87,I don't knowover what-- so I wrote
1140,01:13:06.87,01:13:08.70,"his name thinking,""Well, it doesn't matter,"
1141,01:13:08.70,01:13:11.10,because everyone elseis going to vote off Darrah.
1142,01:13:11.10,01:13:13.93,"So, my vote can go towards Jonand it won't make a difference."""
1143,01:13:13.93,01:13:16.43,"When I got backwith Christa to the tribe,"
1144,01:13:16.43,01:13:18.83,"everything just blew up becauseI was cursing, mad,"
1145,01:13:18.83,01:13:21.00,"screaming, hollering,that, ""How could this"
1146,01:13:21.00,01:13:23.20,"have happened to Rupert?""But I was not aware"
1147,01:13:23.20,01:13:25.00,"that you were going.But, remember, I"
1148,01:13:25.00,01:13:28.47,always told you: Jon is a snake.Something's going down.
1149,01:13:28.47,01:13:30.80,This is-this is not right.And what did you say?
1150,01:13:30.80,01:13:33.10,"""Drake all the way.We bleed Drake."
1151,01:13:33.10,01:13:35.70,"Alliance this, alliance that.""And look what happened."

1158,01:13:55.13,01:13:58.20,I have one important questionthat will decipher
1159,01:13:58.20,01:14:00.87,who I would liketo have win a million dollars.
1160,01:14:00.87,01:14:03.60,"My question is,give me one reason"
1161,01:14:03.60,01:14:05.90,why the other persondoes not deserve to win
1162,01:14:05.90,01:14:08.17,a million dollarsand why you do.
1163,01:14:08.17,01:14:10.67,"And I'll startwith you, Lill, first."
1164,01:14:10.67,01:14:12.77,">> Forgive me.>> No, you have to say"
1165,01:14:12.77,01:14:14.63,something bad about me.Go ahead.
1166,01:14:14.63,01:14:18.83,"(all laughing)>> Um, I felt that"
1167,01:14:18.83,01:14:20.93,"there was, at times,Sandra had disrespected"
1168,01:14:20.93,01:14:25.47,a number of people.I know a number of times
1169,01:14:25.47,01:14:28.87,"that she'd called me an""M.F.-er"", and all this stuff."
1170,01:14:28.87,01:14:32.47,"Um, I felt thatat a lot of times"
1171,01:14:32.47,01:14:36.43,that she did ride the coattailsof other people--
1172,01:14:36.43,01:14:41.40,"that she would always say,""You tell me what to do."""
1173,01:14:41.40,01:14:45.13,"And, at times,I wanted to, you know, say,"
1174,01:14:45.13,01:14:47.33,"""Well, do you havea mind of your own,"
1175,01:14:47.33,01:14:49.80,"and can you figurestuff out yourself?"""
1176,01:14:49.80,01:14:53.63,That's all I want to state.I'm not going to keep going.
1177,01:14:53.63,01:14:56.53,">> No, that's fine. Thank you.Sandra."
1178,01:14:56.53,01:14:58.97,>> One good reason:because Lill is responsible
1179,01:14:58.97,01:15:02.70,for every single personbeing out that's there.
1180,01:15:02.70,01:15:06.90,Every single one of yougot a vote from Lill.
1181,01:15:06.90,01:15:08.37,"Christa, you didn'tget my vote never."
1182,01:15:08.37,01:15:11.73,"I never put you out of the game.Rupert, I never put you"
1183,01:15:11.73,01:15:14.97,out of the game. Um...That's just one thing.
1184,01:15:14.97,01:15:16.90,"Because she is a hard worker,so the only thing"
1185,01:15:16.90,01:15:19.37,I can say is that everyonethat's there is there
1186,01:15:19.37,01:15:22.87,because of Lill.>> Okay.
1187,01:15:22.87,01:15:24.67,>> PROBST: Satisfied?>> Yes. Thank you.

1190,01:15:35.17,01:15:37.63,Rock stars.Um...
1191,01:15:37.63,01:15:41.97,"Lill, first question for you.So, you always would say,"
1192,01:15:41.97,01:15:45.33,"""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,I'm sorry,"" and..."
1193,01:15:45.33,01:15:46.73,"about everything.You'd win something,"
1194,01:15:46.73,01:15:50.17,"you'd say, ""I'm sorry.""And then two seconds later,"
1195,01:15:50.17,01:15:52.50,you'd start recitingyour Boy Scout's Oath.
1196,01:15:52.50,01:15:54.90,"So, you always are hidingbehind this"
1197,01:15:54.90,01:15:58.17,Boy Scout's Oath of yours.What's the reason for all of it?
1198,01:15:58.17,01:16:01.30,"What did you really want to say?>> All right, when did I say"
1199,01:16:01.30,01:16:03.57,I was sorry to youfor something?
1200,01:16:03.57,01:16:08.10,">> Uh... ""I'm sorry about...voting Rupert out."""
1201,01:16:08.10,01:16:11.20,"""I'm sorry about...taking this reward."""
1202,01:16:11.20,01:16:13.17,"I mean, just, sorry all thetime."
1203,01:16:13.17,01:16:15.97,">> On those two occasions,I was sincerely sorry."
1204,01:16:15.97,01:16:18.47,It took a lot out of meto vote Rupert out.
1205,01:16:18.47,01:16:22.50,But I felt like I had to followmy alliance on that.
1206,01:16:22.50,01:16:25.97,I did not hide behindthe Oath all day long.
1207,01:16:25.97,01:16:29.77,It's 16 years of volunteering.It's something that I...
1208,01:16:29.77,01:16:31.77,I had no other clothes.I was in it.
1209,01:16:31.77,01:16:34.20,I was stuck in it.It was part of me.
1210,01:16:34.20,01:16:36.20,">> So, because of the clothesthat you happened to be"
1211,01:16:36.20,01:16:38.40,wearing...>> Because of 16 years

1213,01:16:41.33,01:16:43.80,it was so much a part of me.The first time
1214,01:16:43.80,01:16:47.27,that I lied in this gamewas with Rupert.
1215,01:16:47.27,01:16:51.60,That was the very first time.And it made me realize
1216,01:16:51.60,01:16:54.20,"that if I didn't,I wouldn't stay in this game"
1217,01:16:54.20,01:16:58.50,for very long.>> So... I guess that's it?
1218,01:16:58.50,01:17:01.97,"Sandra, since I spenta lot of time with you,"
1219,01:17:01.97,01:17:03.97,I always would havethe opportunity
1220,01:17:03.97,01:17:06.47,to hear these crazy ideasthat you would come up with.

1223,01:17:10.40,01:17:12.20,really knewthat you would come up
1224,01:17:12.20,01:17:14.37,"with these crazy plans.So, I was wondering,"
1225,01:17:14.37,01:17:18.97,what is your most...challenging...
1226,01:17:18.97,01:17:21.87,plotting and scheming obstacleto keep yourself alive

1228,01:17:24.20,01:17:25.93,was the onewhen me and Tijuana
1229,01:17:25.93,01:17:29.17,snuck behind the bushesand low-crawled through the
1230,01:17:29.17,01:17:31.10,dirt.It was then official
1231,01:17:31.10,01:17:34.90,that she was in an alliancewith Jon and Burton
1232,01:17:34.90,01:17:37.47,"after she said thatwhen she left the Morgan Tribe,"
1233,01:17:37.47,01:17:41.53,she was in an... in an alliancewith the two Morgan females.

1251,01:18:30.17,01:18:33.13,"that we're in today,I think I would have done"
1252,01:18:33.13,01:18:36.00,"maybe a five,because of the simple fact"

1280,01:20:00.80,01:20:03.27,Nobody worried about Sandrabecause Sandra was weak.

1283,01:20:09.53,01:20:13.53,I was ready to give up whoever.I was just always there

1285,01:20:14.80,01:20:17.07,and let the vote goin a different direction

1300,01:21:11.37,01:21:13.87,Some people were ableto represent themselves

1302,01:21:16.27,01:21:19.87,"is the two of you.For Sandra, I think you..."
1303,01:21:19.87,01:21:22.97,you made an attemptto represent Puerto Ricans.
1304,01:21:22.97,01:21:25.43,How do you feel you didwearing that...

1309,01:21:34.63,01:21:37.57,"If I backstabbed somebody,I was backstabbed myself."
1310,01:21:37.57,01:21:41.67,"So, I just took care of myself.And that's where I get it from,"
1311,01:21:41.67,01:21:45.10,"maybe because I'm Puerto Rican,that I know that if I don't"
1312,01:21:45.10,01:21:46.80,"look out for number one,ain't nobody going"
1313,01:21:46.80,01:21:49.23,"to look out for me.Keep going, or that's good?"
1314,01:21:49.23,01:21:51.93,>> I'm totally happy with that.>> Okay.

1318,01:21:58.23,01:22:01.77,in the game in which you madea promise to me.
1319,01:22:01.77,01:22:05.27,Didn't quite live upto one of those duties:
1320,01:22:05.27,01:22:07.73,truthfulness.How do you feel that
1321,01:22:07.73,01:22:10.17,you've represented the Scoutsand represented that uniform?
1322,01:22:10.17,01:22:13.40,">> If I had it to do over again,I would not be wearing"
1323,01:22:13.40,01:22:15.33,this uniform.I would not be representing
1324,01:22:15.33,01:22:17.47,the Scouts.This game has nothing to do
1325,01:22:17.47,01:22:22.40,"with honor, integrity...it has nothing to do"
1326,01:22:22.40,01:22:27.93,with what the Scout Oath isand what the Scouts represent.
1327,01:22:27.93,01:22:30.37,"You know, I was stillin my little world"
1328,01:22:30.37,01:22:33.43,of being back homebeing the Scout Master.
1329,01:22:33.43,01:22:36.07,"And then, again,I had to switch modes"
1330,01:22:36.07,01:22:41.13,and be the S.O.B. that votedoff Rupert.
1331,01:22:41.13,01:22:44.17,"I wasn't happy about it,and, no, I did not represent"
1332,01:22:44.17,01:22:47.87,"the Scouts very well at all.>> PROBST: Thanks, Jon."
1333,01:22:47.87,01:22:52.57,">> Thank you.>> PROBST: Sandra, Lill, you"
1334,01:22:52.57,01:22:56.07,have weathered the questions andcomments from the jury.
1335,01:22:56.07,01:22:59.50,"In a moment, I'll give you achance to make a final rebuttal."
1336,01:22:59.50,01:23:04.53,I suggest you take this timeto think about your last words.
1337,01:23:30.77,01:23:35.17,">> PROBST: Okay, Lill, Sandra,this is your last chance"
1338,01:23:35.17,01:23:39.87,to get at the core of whyyou deserve the million dollars.
1339,01:23:39.87,01:23:43.13,"So, Sandra,let's start with you."
1340,01:23:43.13,01:23:47.37,">> Um, I think I played thisgame the way I knew how."
1341,01:23:47.37,01:23:50.50,"Um, when I came here,I represented myself"
1342,01:23:50.50,01:23:54.17,the way that I truly am.There was no lies or deceptions
1343,01:23:54.17,01:23:57.57,about how Sandra is.I always thought that my mouth
1344,01:23:57.57,01:24:00.80,"would get me in trouble,but now that I look at it,"
1345,01:24:00.80,01:24:02.13,being openand-and saying things
1346,01:24:02.13,01:24:05.17,"the way they areis what, I think, helped me"
1347,01:24:05.17,01:24:07.30,"to get this far.Um, because whenever anyone"
1348,01:24:07.30,01:24:10.43,"approached me and said,""Sandra, we need to do this"
1349,01:24:10.43,01:24:12.90,"this way,"" or whatever,I openly and frankly"
1350,01:24:12.90,01:24:16.03,"expressed my opinion,""Yes, I'll help you,"" or"
1351,01:24:16.03,01:24:18.93,"""Yes, I'll go with you.""Um, I am, actually,"
1352,01:24:18.93,01:24:22.20,"surprised to be sitting here.But now that I am,"
1353,01:24:22.20,01:24:25.47,"I'm kind of glad.Um, I think I'm a good person,"
1354,01:24:25.47,01:24:27.17,regardless if Icussed you out or not.
1355,01:24:27.17,01:24:28.83,That's how I was feelingat the time.
1356,01:24:28.83,01:24:31.83,"Um, there's no regretsabout whatever I did,"
1357,01:24:31.83,01:24:34.33,"and I'm glad to be sitting here,and that's all I can say."
1358,01:24:34.33,01:24:36.10,Thank you very muchfor your time.
1359,01:24:36.10,01:24:38.63,">> PROBST: Lill, last chanceto convince the jury"
1360,01:24:38.63,01:24:41.03,to give you a million dollars.>> If I had this
1361,01:24:41.03,01:24:43.50,"to do all over again,the Boy Scout uniform"
1362,01:24:43.50,01:24:46.47,would have been at home.It's easy target
1363,01:24:46.47,01:24:52.00,"for anybody to say, ""Boy Scouts:""dignity, honor. Survivor: liar,"
1364,01:24:52.00,01:24:57.30,"cheater,"" whatever.Two things don't come together."
1365,01:24:57.30,01:25:00.47,"And whatever you guys sayabout my honor, my integrity..."
1366,01:25:00.47,01:25:05.40,"it's bull ...It's that way, here."
1367,01:25:05.40,01:25:10.03,"It's not that way home.Now, why you should give it to"
1368,01:25:10.03,01:25:15.67,"me and not give it to Sandra?I also tried to learn this game,"
1369,01:25:15.67,01:25:19.33,play this game as best I could.I also tried to remain
1370,01:25:19.33,01:25:22.00,"respectful to people,and I also tried"
1371,01:25:22.00,01:25:25.37,"to form friendships.Friendships dissolved,"
1372,01:25:25.37,01:25:29.30,"and it hurt me bad, because Icouldn't do anything about it."
1373,01:25:29.30,01:25:33.47,"You either play the game,or you get voted out."
1374,01:25:33.47,01:25:37.13,"So no matter what you guys do,I did the best I could"
1375,01:25:37.13,01:25:40.23,with what I had...and the person that I am.
1376,01:25:40.23,01:25:44.73,"And, like, this is one night.Yeah, it's a big reward,"
1377,01:25:44.73,01:25:47.50,but I'm going back home.I'm gonna be the Big Lill
1378,01:25:47.50,01:25:52.07,to 75 kids that look up to me.And I'm going to explain to them
1379,01:25:52.07,01:25:56.40,that this was a game.Put the Scout uniform aside.
1380,01:25:56.40,01:26:01.83,"I wish I had, and I didn't.Thank you."
1381,01:26:01.83,01:26:06.70,">> PROBST: Okay, Lill, Sandra,thank you for your comments."
1382,01:26:06.70,01:26:08.37,"Jury, thank you for yourquestions and comments."
1383,01:26:08.37,01:26:13.20,"It is now time,finally, to get to the vote."
1384,01:26:13.20,01:26:14.53,Voting isa little different tonight.
1385,01:26:14.53,01:26:17.60,You are not voting somebodyout of the game.
1386,01:26:17.60,01:26:21.40,You are voting for a winner.You are voting for the person
1387,01:26:21.40,01:26:24.93,that you think is most deservingthe title of Sole Survivor
1388,01:26:24.93,01:26:26.73,"and the million dollars,so you want"
1389,01:26:26.73,01:26:31.03,to see your nameon the parchment tonight.
1390,01:26:31.03,01:26:35.10,"It is time to vote-- Ryno,you're up."

1392,01:27:20.93,01:27:24.03,"You deserve it.From the first day, when we"
1393,01:27:24.03,01:27:27.40,"were blood brother and sister,I was just thrilled to have"
1394,01:27:27.40,01:27:31.83,somebody on my side.I'm glad I can be there
1395,01:27:31.83,01:27:35.63,for you now.I hope you win.
1396,01:28:22.33,01:28:26.20,">> Sandra, I couldn't understandif your strategy in the game,"

1398,01:28:29.47,01:28:32.13,"or if it was by luck that yougot into the right alliance,"
1399,01:28:32.13,01:28:34.27,"and you decided to be up front,so, with that"
1400,01:28:34.27,01:28:36.87,"being said, I had to lookat who played the game,"
1401,01:28:36.87,01:28:39.60,"regardless of Tribal Council,um, to the best"
1402,01:28:39.60,01:28:41.03,"of their ability.Lill, I think"
1403,01:28:41.03,01:28:43.90,"that you did a phenomenal job. Um, you came in the Outcasts,"
1404,01:28:43.90,01:28:47.03, and you came back in the game. And I think that you started
1405,01:28:47.03,01:28:49.77," to play it by using your mind. So, with that being said,"
1406,01:28:49.77,01:29:07.17,"this vote goes to you, Lill.>> PROBST: For the last time,"
