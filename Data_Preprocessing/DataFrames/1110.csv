58,00:01:13:00,00:01:13:00,Jamie wins immunity.

70,00:01:29:06,00:01:29:06,>> I think it\'s pretty amazing

72,00:01:31:18,00:01:31:18,clue that it\'s on the ground.
73,00:01:32:28,00:01:32:28,I wonder why he\'s looking in

135,00:04:22:02,00:04:22:02,And then it seemed like he was

438,00:11:39:03,00:11:39:03,"Danni, Steph, Gary, Judd win"
439,00:11:41:25,00:11:41:25,reward.
440,00:11:44:15,00:11:44:15,>> Good job!
441,00:11:45:13,00:11:45:13,We\'re still going to finish.
442,00:11:46:23,00:11:46:23,We\'re still going to finish.
443,00:11:48:05,00:11:48:05,Let\'s go.
444,00:11:49:02,00:11:49:02,>> It\'s a done deal.
445,00:11:50:03,00:11:50:03,>> Oh!
446,00:11:51:03,00:11:51:03,>> Let\'s finish.
447,00:11:52:01,00:11:52:01,>> It\'s just worth doing right.
448,00:11:57:08,00:11:57:08,>> We\'re not quitting.
449,00:11:58:11,00:11:58:11,Let\'s... come on!
450,00:11:59:06,00:11:59:06,"Come on, let\'s go."
451,00:12:00:07,00:12:00:07,">> They already won, Jamie."
452,00:12:01:17,00:12:01:17,There\'s nothing we can do about
453,00:12:03:01,00:12:03:01,it.
454,00:12:03:23,00:12:03:23,">> Okay, fine."
455,00:12:04:27,00:12:04:27,(speaking indistinctly)
456,00:12:14:10,00:12:14:10,>> PROBST: You guys ready?
457,00:12:15:05,00:12:15:05,>> Yeah.
458,00:12:16:01,00:12:16:01,>> PROBST: Hit it.
459,00:12:51:22,00:12:51:22,">> Guys, day 25 is the best day"
460,00:12:53:07,00:12:53:07,so far.
461,00:12:54:05,00:12:54:05,>> We\'re covered in mud.
462,00:12:55:06,00:12:55:06,>> One of the best days of my
463,00:12:56:12,00:12:56:12,life.
464,00:12:57:02,00:12:57:02,">> Me, too."
465,00:12:58:05,00:12:58:05,>> Just to get away from camp
466,00:12:59:02,00:12:59:02,was enough.
467,00:13:00:08,00:13:00:08,It was my first time actually in
468,00:13:01:21,00:13:01:21,"a helicopter, so that was an"
469,00:13:03:01,00:13:03:01,awesome experience in itself.
470,00:13:11:11,00:13:11:11,">> We\'re going to a mansion, you"
471,00:13:12:06,00:13:12:06,guys.
472,00:13:13:03,00:13:13:03,How weird is it going to feel
473,00:13:14:06,00:13:14:06,being in a bathroom and looking
474,00:13:16:00,00:13:16:00,in the mirror?
475,00:13:17:00,00:13:17:00,">> Oh, that\'s right, the mirror."
476,00:13:18:02,00:13:18:02,>> I don\'t need that.
477,00:13:19:01,00:13:19:01,I don\'t want to look.
478,00:13:20:01,00:13:20:01,">> Oh, you guys, how amazing."
479,00:13:34:11,00:13:34:11,">> Oh, this is so beautiful!"
480,00:13:36:20,00:13:36:20,>> Hi!
481,00:13:37:22,00:13:37:22,>> Hey!
482,00:13:39:01,00:13:39:01,We\'re home!
483,00:13:39:25,00:13:39:25,>> Greetings. Welcome.
484,00:13:40:25,00:13:40:25,>> The helicopter dropped us off
485,00:13:41:27,00:13:41:27,"not too far from the house, and"
486,00:13:43:07,00:13:43:07,"you were greeted by this dude,"
487,00:13:44:17,00:13:44:17,Louie.

489,00:13:47:05,00:13:47:05,your casa.
490,00:13:47:27,00:13:47:27,">> We were filthy, man, full of"
491,00:13:49:07,00:13:49:07,mud.
492,00:13:50:10,00:13:50:10,">> Okay, look at the pool."
493,00:13:51:26,00:13:51:26,">> Oh, look at the food."
494,00:13:53:08,00:13:53:08,(yelling)
495,00:13:54:16,00:13:54:16,">> Oh, nice."
496,00:13:55:15,00:13:55:15,>> This pool is unbelievable!
497,00:13:57:25,00:13:57:25,>> He took us down to the pool
498,00:14:00:07,00:14:00:07,"area, where we all showered up."
499,00:14:04:07,00:14:04:07,>> Eww!
500,00:14:05:10,00:14:05:10,(giggling)
501,00:14:07:20,00:14:07:20,>> I would not have rather gone
502,00:14:09:17,00:14:09:17,on that reward with any other
503,00:14:11:11,00:14:11:11,people than those three that I
504,00:14:13:08,00:14:13:08,was with.
505,00:14:15:07,00:14:15:07,>> Two hot girls getting in the
506,00:14:16:21,00:14:16:21,shower together.
507,00:14:17:22,00:14:17:22,">> I-I wouldn\'t go that far, not"
508,00:14:19:01,00:14:19:01,right now.
509,00:14:20:02,00:14:20:02,"Danni and I are, like, really"
510,00:14:21:06,00:14:21:06,similar.
511,00:14:22:03,00:14:22:03,She\'s a cool chick.
512,00:14:23:03,00:14:23:03,(screaming)
513,00:14:24:00,00:14:24:00,"And Gary is just an awesome,"
514,00:14:25:11,00:14:25:11,genuine guy.
515,00:14:26:06,00:14:26:06,And Judd and I have been buds
516,00:14:27:20,00:14:27:20,since the day I met him.
517,00:14:29:01,00:14:29:01,>> I\'m just taking all my

519,00:14:31:06,00:14:31:06,>> Really?
520,00:14:32:03,00:14:32:03,>> Yep.
521,00:14:32:21,00:14:32:21,(bird cawing)
522,00:14:33:22,00:14:33:22,">> What are you doing, Judd?"
523,00:14:35:05,00:14:35:05,(giggling)
524,00:14:35:26,00:14:35:26,>> It\'s all right.
525,00:14:37:00,00:14:37:00,It\'s coming off.
526,00:14:38:00,00:14:38:00,(laughing)
527,00:14:38:20,00:14:38:20,>> It was definitely the best
528,00:14:40:11,00:14:40:11,foursome out here that I could
529,00:14:42:06,00:14:42:06,have gone on this most amazing
530,00:14:44:01,00:14:44:01,reward with.
531,00:14:45:00,00:14:45:00,This is more like very fancy
532,00:14:46:25,00:14:46:25,hors d\'oeuvres.
533,00:14:47:23,00:14:47:23,"Oh, lobster."
534,00:14:48:16,00:14:48:16,>> There you go.
535,00:14:49:18,00:14:49:18,">> Oh, it\'s a jalape\xc3\xb1o!"
536,00:14:51:07,00:14:51:07,We ate so much!
537,00:14:52:07,00:14:52:07,"Oh, there\'s a lot of meat in"
538,00:14:53:18,00:14:53:18,here.
539,00:14:54:08,00:14:54:08,"Did I do well, or am I missing"
540,00:14:56:05,00:14:56:05,"out, like still on a bunch of"
541,00:14:58:02,00:14:58:02,it?
542,00:14:58:28,00:14:58:28,">> No, you\'re doing good."
543,00:15:00:22,00:15:00:22,">> I love to eat, but Stephenie"
544,00:15:02:12,00:15:02:12,eats even more than I do.
545,00:15:03:23,00:15:03:23,>> Whoa!
546,00:15:04:13,00:15:04:13,">> It\'s good, isn\'t it?"
547,00:15:05:20,00:15:05:20,I haven\'t had a chance to get
548,00:15:07:07,00:15:07:07,"to know her, and I think the"
549,00:15:09:00,00:15:09:00,reward helps a lot.
550,00:15:10:03,00:15:10:03,I do feel bad that they\'re
551,00:15:11:05,00:15:11:05,back there.
552,00:15:12:02,00:15:12:02,">> Lydia, she was so down on"
553,00:15:13:25,00:15:13:25,"herself, I can\'t even imagine"
554,00:15:15:12,00:15:15:12,today how she feels.
555,00:15:16:18,00:15:16:18,>> Oh...
556,00:15:19:06,00:15:19:06,>> My sincere apologies to you
557,00:15:21:06,00:15:21:06,"guys, though, man."
558,00:15:22:06,00:15:22:06,You guys were ahead.
559,00:15:23:18,00:15:23:18,You and Jamie were ahead of-of
560,00:15:25:18,00:15:25:18,Gary and Judd.
561,00:15:27:03,00:15:27:03,You were!
562,00:15:28:06,00:15:28:06,">> Yeah, but i-it doesn\'t"
563,00:15:29:23,00:15:29:23,"matter, Lydia."
564,00:15:30:21,00:15:30:21,">> A bath, a nice bath and"
565,00:15:32:11,00:15:32:11,coffee in the morning and
566,00:15:34:07,00:15:34:07,pancakes with syrup.
567,00:15:35:02,00:15:35:02,>> I don\'t need to hear it.
568,00:15:36:18,00:15:36:18,>> And a helicopter ride.
569,00:15:38:01,00:15:38:01,">> Yeah, I\'m a little sad about"
570,00:15:39:18,00:15:39:18,the helicopter ride.
571,00:15:41:01,00:15:41:01,(laughing)
572,00:15:58:10,00:15:58:10,>> I know we can get there if
573,00:15:59:20,00:15:59:20,you just... if you... if you
574,00:16:01:02,00:16:01:02,trust me.
575,00:16:01:21,00:16:01:21,You know what I\'m saying?
576,00:16:02:23,00:16:02:23,">> Okay. I feel good about that,"
577,00:16:04:00,00:16:04:00,then.
578,00:16:04:27,00:16:04:27,">> Well, can you swear like..."
579,00:16:06:12,00:16:06:12,we\'ll go to the final three
580,00:16:08:00,00:16:08:00,together?
581,00:16:08:21,00:16:08:21,"Because I will give you my word,"
582,00:16:10:06,00:16:10:06,and I know I can pull it.
583,00:16:11:02,00:16:11:02,>> I don\'t know.
584,00:16:11:28,00:16:11:28,"Like, I don\'t feel good about"
585,00:16:13:01,00:16:13:01,giving you my word as a man if
586,00:16:14:13,00:16:14:13,I\'m not like 100% on it.
587,00:16:15:17,00:16:15:17,Do you know what I mean?
588,00:16:16:20,00:16:16:20,">> Yeah, yeah, why aren\'t you"
589,00:16:18:00,00:16:18:00,100% about it? Like...
590,00:16:18:28,00:16:18:28,">> Well, because I haven\'t"
591,00:16:20:05,00:16:20:05,thought about it at all.
592,00:16:21:06,00:16:21:06,>> You think about it.
593,00:16:22:05,00:16:22:05,">> Yeah, let me... \'Cause I-I..."
594,00:16:23:13,00:16:23:13,"You know, I\'m not just going to"
595,00:16:24:27,00:16:24:27,"sit here and swear to you after,"
596,00:16:26:05,00:16:26:05,"like, five minutes of thinking"
597,00:16:27:08,00:16:27:08,about it.
598,00:16:28:01,00:16:28:01,">> Yeah, yeah."
599,00:16:29:03,00:16:29:03,>> I\'ve almost given up trying
600,00:16:30:03,00:16:30:03,to understand Jamie\'s strategy
601,00:16:31:03,00:16:31:03,in this game.
602,00:16:33:22,00:16:33:22,I think that Jamie is just kind
603,00:16:35:22,00:16:35:22,"of losing it, almost, in terms"
604,00:16:37:22,00:16:37:22,of paranoia.
605,00:16:38:15,00:16:38:15,Like he\'s just letting the game
606,00:16:40:06,00:16:40:06,"really, really get to him, and"
607,00:16:41:20,00:16:41:20,he is constantly freaked out.
608,00:16:42:23,00:16:42:23,">> Here, I\'ll make an easy swear"
609,00:16:44:06,00:16:44:06,for you.
610,00:16:44:28,00:16:44:28,Do you want to just swear the
611,00:16:46:07,00:16:46:07,top six right now?
612,00:16:47:00,00:16:47:00,>> I already have.
613,00:16:47:18,00:16:47:18,">> Okay, well I..."
614,00:16:48:06,00:16:48:06,>> I already told you yesterday.
615,00:16:54:26,00:16:54:26,>> I won\'t sucker you.
616,00:16:58:08,00:16:58:08,Yeah. (chuckles)
617,00:17:09:01,00:17:09:01,>> I feel like my family at
618,00:17:10:12,00:17:10:12,Christmas-- we\'re all wearing
619,00:17:12:06,00:17:12:06,the same pajamas.
620,00:17:13:03,00:17:13:03,>> What a great feeling.
621,00:17:14:08,00:17:14:08,"It\'s just like, just rejuvenated"
622,00:17:16:01,00:17:16:01,me and everybody else with me.
623,00:17:17:26,00:17:17:26,There\'s no doubt that this would
624,00:17:19:18,00:17:19:18,be a good time to try and make
625,00:17:21:06,00:17:21:06,some ties with Stephenie and
626,00:17:22:11,00:17:22:11,Judd.
627,00:17:23:08,00:17:23:08,"If they shut me down, they shut"
628,00:17:25:07,00:17:25:07,me down.
629,00:17:26:08,00:17:26:08,"But, uh, I\'ve got to try because"
630,00:17:27:27,00:17:27:27,I\'m the next to go if-if they
631,00:17:29:07,00:17:29:07,don\'t change.
632,00:17:34:01,00:17:34:01,>> Okay.
633,00:17:38:05,00:17:38:05,>> Hard question.
634,00:17:40:01,00:17:40:01,>> My whole thing with you...
635,00:17:41:08,00:17:41:08,>> Mm-hmm.
636,00:17:42:05,00:17:42:05,>> ...and my whole thing with
637,00:17:43:25,00:17:43:25,Danni has been I want to take
638,00:17:45:08,00:17:45:08,the strongest four to the final
639,00:17:46:20,00:17:46:20,four...
640,00:17:47:17,00:17:47:17,>> Yeah.
641,00:17:48:05,00:17:48:05,>> ...so nobody slides by...
642,00:17:49:05,00:17:49:05,">> Right, and he said that since"
643,00:17:50:20,00:17:50:20,day one.

646,00:17:54:07,00:17:54:07,that are great competitors.
647,00:17:55:11,00:17:55:11,"The play was, ""Hey, I want the"
648,00:17:56:27,00:17:56:27,best in the finals so you\'re

652,00:18:01:07,00:18:01:07,"But, uh, all\'s I could do is"
653,00:18:02:26,00:18:02:26,plant a seed.
654,00:18:03:20,00:18:03:20,"If Lydia goes to the final two,"
655,00:18:05:07,00:18:05:07,guess who\'s winning?
656,00:18:06:02,00:18:06:02,>> She\'ll win.
657,00:18:06:21,00:18:06:21,>> She\'ll win.
658,00:18:07:08,00:18:07:08,>> Lydia.
659,00:18:08:02,00:18:08:02,>> Of course.
660,00:18:09:05,00:18:09:05,>> We know that.
661,00:18:10:01,00:18:10:01,>> If Cindy goes to the final
662,00:18:11:10,00:18:11:10,"two, guess who\'s winning? Cindy."
663,00:18:12:15,00:18:12:15,>> We know that.
664,00:18:13:17,00:18:13:17,>> And-And do they deserve it?
665,00:18:14:26,00:18:14:26,>> I\'m fine with that logic--
666,00:18:16:02,00:18:16:02,"like to be the best, beat the"
667,00:18:17:06,00:18:17:06,best.
668,00:18:18:02,00:18:18:02,"But then at the same time, I"
669,00:18:19:15,00:18:19:15,have such a good thing going.
670,00:18:20:20,00:18:20:20,It\'s kind of iffy.
671,00:18:21:13,00:18:21:13,So I\'m not... really not sure
672,00:18:22:20,00:18:22:20,if we\'re going to go with that.
673,00:18:24:00,00:18:24:00,But it\'s a good idea.
674,00:18:25:01,00:18:25:01,">> Let me ask you this, then."
675,00:18:26:05,00:18:26:05,In a perfect world...
676,00:18:27:05,00:18:27:05,>> Yeah.
677,00:18:28:02,00:18:28:02,">> ...numbers aside, in this"
678,00:18:29:00,00:18:29:00,game who would be the next
679,00:18:30:07,00:18:30:07,person you guys would want to
680,00:18:31:03,00:18:31:03,vote out?
681,00:18:32:01,00:18:32:01,>> There\'s no doubt who I\'d vote
682,00:18:33:05,00:18:33:05,out.
683,00:18:34:02,00:18:34:02,">> Me, too. Jamie."
684,00:18:35:01,00:18:35:01,">> Well, who would it be?"
685,00:18:35:25,00:18:35:25,>> Jamie.
686,00:18:36:22,00:18:36:22,>> Because of his attitude?
687,00:18:37:23,00:18:37:23,>> Yeah.
688,00:18:38:25,00:18:38:25,">> Oh, yeah."
689,00:18:39:25,00:18:39:25,>> Bonding with Gary and Danni
690,00:18:41:06,00:18:41:06,"is not going to affect my game,"
691,00:18:42:26,00:18:42:26,because I know what my game plan
692,00:18:44:03,00:18:44:03,is.
693,00:18:45:13,00:18:45:13,But it\'s nice to get to know
694,00:18:46:22,00:18:46:22,somebody different who you
695,00:18:47:17,00:18:47:17,never met before.
696,00:18:48:12,00:18:48:12,>> I love Guatemala right now.
697,00:18:50:03,00:18:50:03,(chuckling)
698,00:18:52:16,00:18:52:16,">> Good night, Judd."
699,00:18:53:20,00:18:53:20,">> Good night, Gary."
700,00:18:54:15,00:18:54:15,"Good game, man."
701,00:18:55:05,00:18:55:05,">> Yeah. You, too."
702,00:18:56:01,00:18:56:01,>> Sometimes this game affects
703,00:18:57:21,00:18:57:21,your heart a little bit.
704,00:18:58:28,00:18:58:28,Sometimes it kind of wrenches it
705,00:19:00:18,00:19:00:18,a bit.
706,00:19:01:07,00:19:01:07,And getting rid of those two
707,00:19:02:15,00:19:02:15,"is... you know, that\'s gonna be"
708,00:19:03:25,00:19:03:25,a little heart-wrenching.
709,00:19:04:22,00:19:04:22,But that\'s just the way the game
710,00:19:06:02,00:19:06:02,"is, man."
711,00:19:07:07,00:19:07:07,If I want to go further in this
712,00:19:09:01,00:19:09:01,"game, the threats gotta go."
713,00:19:22:05,00:19:22:05,">> Ooh, Nelly!"
714,00:19:23:05,00:19:23:05,"Smell that, baby?"
715,00:19:24:20,00:19:24:20,>> So good!
716,00:19:25:15,00:19:25:15,>> Oh!
717,00:19:26:05,00:19:26:05,">> Oh, look at that, man!"
718,00:19:28:03,00:19:28:03,">> Oh, my gosh."
719,00:19:29:05,00:19:29:05,">> When we got up this morning,"
720,00:19:31:01,00:19:31:01,we could smell coffee.
721,00:19:33:05,00:19:33:05,It was so refreshing to smell
722,00:19:34:21,00:19:34:21,"coffee, rather than the smell of"
723,00:19:36:06,00:19:36:06,the jungle every morning when we
724,00:19:37:28,00:19:37:28,get up.
725,00:19:38:17,00:19:38:17,>> It\'s all crystally.
726,00:19:39:12,00:19:39:12,>> (squeals): So exciting!
727,00:19:40:27,00:19:40:27,">> Oh, you\'re a big coffee fan,"
728,00:19:42:06,00:19:42:06,"Dan, huh?"
729,00:19:43:02,00:19:43:02,">> Well, I drink it a lot in the"
730,00:19:44:21,00:19:44:21,mornings when I have early
731,00:19:45:26,00:19:45:26,mornings.
732,00:19:46:16,00:19:46:16,There was like six different
733,00:19:48:02,00:19:48:02,flavors of Folgers coffee.
734,00:19:49:17,00:19:49:17,And we tried all of them.
735,00:19:50:16,00:19:50:16,">> Oh, my God!"
736,00:19:53:07,00:19:53:07,"Oh, let\'s sit down."
737,00:19:54:01,00:19:54:01,">> Oh, man!"
738,00:19:55:01,00:19:55:01,>> Where do you want to sit?
739,00:19:56:15,00:19:56:15,Hey!
740,00:19:58:07,00:19:58:07,>> What\'s up?
741,00:19:59:03,00:19:59:03,>> Louie!
742,00:20:00:03,00:20:00:03,>> Good morning.
743,00:20:01:01,00:20:01:01,>> What\'s going on?
744,00:20:02:06,00:20:02:06,">> Actually, I\'m bringing a"
745,00:20:03:07,00:20:03:07,little present.
746,00:20:04:01,00:20:04:01,>> Okay.
747,00:20:04:26,00:20:04:26,>> Oh!
748,00:20:05:18,00:20:05:18,>> Enjoy it.
749,00:20:06:22,00:20:06:22,>> Thank you very much.
750,00:20:07:20,00:20:07:20,>> Thank you.
751,00:20:08:12,00:20:08:12,">> Thank you, Louie."
752,00:20:09:23,00:20:09:23,>> Look like videotapes.
753,00:20:10:26,00:20:10:26,>> Stop it.
754,00:20:12:00,00:20:12:00,>> Mm-mmm.
755,00:20:13:00,00:20:13:00,">> Oh, my God!"
756,00:20:14:07,00:20:14:07,>> Are they?
757,00:20:15:15,00:20:15:15,">> Oh, my God!"
758,00:20:17:17,00:20:17:17,">> Lou, our little buddy, comes"
759,00:20:19:06,00:20:19:06,over and gives us a present.
760,00:20:20:17,00:20:20:17,"Open it up, it\'s videotapes from"
761,00:20:22:02,00:20:22:02,home.
762,00:20:23:03,00:20:23:03,>> Stephenie.
763,00:20:24:05,00:20:24:05,>> I told my family I wouldn\'t
764,00:20:26:05,00:20:26:05,cry.
765,00:20:27:05,00:20:27:05,>> If we didn\'t get any food or
766,00:20:28:08,00:20:28:08,shower or nothing and just got
767,00:20:29:18,00:20:29:18,"the videotapes, I would have"
768,00:20:30:26,00:20:30:26,been completely satisfied.
769,00:20:32:00,00:20:32:00,It was just the icing on the
770,00:20:33:07,00:20:33:07,cake.
771,00:20:34:25,00:20:34:25,">> Well, I\'m at Grandma\'s..."
772,00:20:37:00,00:20:37:00,>> Hey!
773,00:20:37:21,00:20:37:21,>> ...and I love you.
774,00:20:38:21,00:20:38:21,>> Then the tapes come out.
775,00:20:40:11,00:20:40:11,Ooh! That was sweet.
776,00:20:41:11,00:20:41:11,>> I\'m cooking up some hot dogs.
777,00:20:43:02,00:20:43:02,">> Oh, no."
778,00:20:44:02,00:20:44:02,(thud)
779,00:20:44:25,00:20:44:25,">> Whoa, hey, easy there."
780,00:20:46:26,00:20:46:26,">> Hi, honey."
781,00:20:47:27,00:20:47:27,">> Oh, my gosh"
782,00:20:49:02,00:20:49:02,">> I miss you very, very much."
783,00:20:51:10,00:20:51:10,"Life is very, very, very boring"
784,00:20:54:00,00:20:54:00,without you.
785,00:20:54:18,00:20:54:18,">> My wife, my daughter, my mom,"
786,00:20:56:13,00:20:56:13,"my nieces, my sister and my"
787,00:20:58:06,00:20:58:06,brother-in-law.
788,00:20:59:02,00:20:59:02,">> We miss you, but..."
789,00:21:00:11,00:21:00:11,have a nice cold beer and a fat
790,00:21:02:10,00:21:02:10,T-bone waiting for you when you
791,00:21:04:07,00:21:04:07,get home.
792,00:21:05:06,00:21:05:06,>> Better than steak and eggs
793,00:21:06:21,00:21:06:21,"any morning, man."
794,00:21:09:05,00:21:09:05,(howls)
795,00:21:10:25,00:21:10:25,(screams and laughter)
796,00:21:13:01,00:21:13:01,">> Hi, Danni, it\'s your mom, of"
797,00:21:14:12,00:21:14:12,course.
798,00:21:15:12,00:21:15:12,I love you so much.
799,00:21:17:06,00:21:17:06,"Boy, do we miss you."
800,00:21:18:07,00:21:18:07,The two most important men in
801,00:21:19:16,00:21:19:16,your life would like to say
802,00:21:20:23,00:21:20:23,hello to you.
803,00:21:21:28,00:21:21:28,>> Hondo.
804,00:21:22:21,00:21:22:21,">> Hey, Danni, it\'s your old"
805,00:21:25:01,00:21:25:01,"buddy, Hondo."
806,00:21:26:01,00:21:26:01,"Boy, I sure miss you."
807,00:21:27:02,00:21:27:02,">> My family, I knew, would be"
808,00:21:28:17,00:21:28:17,fine.
809,00:21:29:28,00:21:29:28,I just wanted to see my dogs and
810,00:21:31:08,00:21:31:08,make sure they were okay.
811,00:21:32:11,00:21:32:11,And they look like they\'ve been
812,00:21:33:23,00:21:33:23,"well fed, so..."
813,00:21:34:28,00:21:34:28,>> I\'ll be talking to you soon.
814,00:21:37:03,00:21:37:03,"Love you, Danni. Bye."
815,00:21:38:26,00:21:38:26,>> Aw...
816,00:21:40:15,00:21:40:15,>> Whoo...
817,00:21:42:03,00:21:42:03,>> Oh...
818,00:21:43:22,00:21:43:22,">> Hi, Aunt Stephenie."
819,00:21:45:11,00:21:45:11,>> How are you?
820,00:21:46:17,00:21:46:17,"Hopefully, the bugs aren\'t"
821,00:21:48:18,00:21:48:18,biting too bad.
822,00:21:50:01,00:21:50:01,>> And I hope you\'re all right.
823,00:21:52:08,00:21:52:08,">> Yes, we do."
824,00:21:53:18,00:21:53:18,>> Bye-bye.
825,00:21:54:12,00:21:54:12,(blows kiss)
826,00:21:55:16,00:21:55:16,>> Kisses!
827,00:21:56:07,00:21:56:07,">> Go, Jets."
828,00:21:57:06,00:21:57:06,(shouting)
829,00:21:59:01,00:21:59:01,>> There was four videotapes in
830,00:22:01:00,00:22:01:00,there of our families.
831,00:22:02:07,00:22:02:07,We watched the videos and
832,00:22:03:13,00:22:03:13,just had a great time.
833,00:22:04:21,00:22:04:21,"I saw everybody else\'s family,"
834,00:22:06:08,00:22:06:08,which was really neat.
835,00:22:07:15,00:22:07:15,\'Cause they\'re always talking
836,00:22:08:21,00:22:08:21,about them.
837,00:22:09:17,00:22:09:17,So now you can connect names
838,00:22:10:28,00:22:10:28,with faces.
839,00:22:11:27,00:22:11:27,">> Hey, Dad, hope everything is"
840,00:22:13:01,00:22:13:01,going good.
841,00:22:13:26,00:22:13:26,I\'m getting ready for
842,00:22:14:26,00:22:14:26,"California, and I will talk to"
843,00:22:16:03,00:22:16:03,you when you get back.
844,00:22:17:06,00:22:17:06,>> I\'m definitely not very good
845,00:22:18:23,00:22:18:23,"at this, but I just want to tell"
846,00:22:20:05,00:22:20:05,you that I love you and miss you
847,00:22:21:23,00:22:21:23,and we\'ll see you soon.
848,00:22:22:27,00:22:22:27,>> I\'m an emotional wreck
849,00:22:24:03,00:22:24:03,anyways when it comes to
850,00:22:25:02,00:22:25:02,anything family.
851,00:22:27:02,00:22:27:02,And not seeing them for 25 days
852,00:22:28:25,00:22:28:25,and then seeing my kids and my
853,00:22:30:05,00:22:30:05,"wife, it was phenomenal."
854,00:22:31:15,00:22:31:15,">> Hey, Dad."
855,00:22:32:26,00:22:32:26,>> Aw...
856,00:22:34:07,00:22:34:07,>> Hope you haven\'t got hit in
857,00:22:36:00,00:22:36:00,the head with a coconut yet.
858,00:22:37:16,00:22:37:16,"But if you have, hi, my name is"
859,00:22:39:11,00:22:39:11,Jamie and I\'m your daughter.
860,00:22:41:05,00:22:41:05,>> You got muscles on top of
861,00:22:42:22,00:22:42:22,your muscles and muscles on top
862,00:22:44:17,00:22:44:17,of those muscles...
863,00:22:46:06,00:22:46:06,>> It was the best reward
864,00:22:48:06,00:22:48:06,challenge prize that we possibly
865,00:22:50:18,00:22:50:18,could have had.
866,00:22:51:26,00:22:51:26,>> ...beat you up.
867,00:22:53:05,00:22:53:05,(laughing)
868,00:22:54:03,00:22:54:03,">> Two weeks, you\'ll be home"
869,00:22:55:28,00:22:55:28,in two weeks.
870,00:23:11:02,00:23:11:02,">> Well, we\'re in the real world"
871,00:23:12:16,00:23:12:16,now.
872,00:23:13:10,00:23:13:10,">> Yeah, back to the hellhole."
873,00:23:16:07,00:23:16:07,>> Here they come.
874,00:23:17:01,00:23:17:01,>> Hey.
875,00:23:18:00,00:23:18:00,>> Is this them?
876,00:23:19:00,00:23:19:00,>> Hi!
877,00:23:19:26,00:23:19:26,>> Hey.
878,00:23:20:16,00:23:20:16,">> Hey, guys."
879,00:23:21:15,00:23:21:15,">> Hey, guys."
880,00:23:22:05,00:23:22:05,>> Welcome back.
881,00:23:23:02,00:23:23:02,">> We didn\'t bring food, so"
882,00:23:24:22,00:23:24:22,don\'t get too excited.
883,00:23:26:02,00:23:26:02,>> We made a little basket of
884,00:23:27:20,00:23:27:20,"different coffees, and I was"
885,00:23:29:05,00:23:29:05,kind of hiding it.
886,00:23:30:07,00:23:30:07,"And I mean Cindy, she\'s a huge"
887,00:23:31:25,00:23:31:25,coffee fan and her eyes just lit
888,00:23:33:05,00:23:33:05,up.
889,00:23:34:21,00:23:34:21,>> Coffee!
890,00:23:35:27,00:23:35:27,">> Oh, Cindy!"
891,00:23:37:01,00:23:37:01,">> Oh, my gosh!"
892,00:23:39:01,00:23:39:01,"Stephenie pulls out this basket,"
893,00:23:41:01,00:23:41:01,"and it\'s got, like, a dozen or"
894,00:23:43:05,00:23:43:05,more little Folgers coffee
895,00:23:45:06,00:23:45:06,"singles, like little tea bags."
896,00:23:47:06,00:23:47:06,I just thought that is the most
897,00:23:48:25,00:23:48:25,perfect thing that they could
898,00:23:50:10,00:23:50:10,possibly walk into camp with.
899,00:23:52:03,00:23:52:03,>> We thought you\'re gonna just
900,00:23:53:03,00:23:53:03,flip.
901,00:23:54:03,00:23:54:03,>> I cannot even believe it.
902,00:23:55:16,00:23:55:16,"I mean, it could have been a"
903,00:23:57:07,00:23:57:07,"basket of cookies, it could have"
904,00:23:58:17,00:23:58:17,"been a basket of rolls,"
905,00:23:59:25,00:23:59:25,whatever.
906,00:24:00:23,00:24:00:23,But it was basket of coffee.
907,00:24:02:06,00:24:02:06,>> Not a lot.
908,00:24:03:03,00:24:03:03,">> Ooh, you guys smell good."
909,00:24:05:01,00:24:05:01,>> How was... did you get a nice
910,00:24:06:28,00:24:06:28,bed to sleep in?
911,00:24:08:01,00:24:08:01,>> I slept on the floor.
912,00:24:09:02,00:24:09:02,>> You didn\'t sleep on the bed?
913,00:24:11:02,00:24:11:02,>> The only person I was really
914,00:24:13:01,00:24:13:01,concerned about was Jamie.
915,00:24:14:22,00:24:14:22,I didn\'t know how he would react
916,00:24:17:00,00:24:17:00,to... to me and Steph going
917,00:24:18:23,00:24:18:23,"away, because I didn\'t want"
918,00:24:20:17,00:24:20:17,Jamie to feel like we made any
919,00:24:22:20,00:24:22:20,"alliances with Danni or Gary,"
920,00:24:24:18,00:24:24:18,"which we didn\'t, so..."
921,00:24:26:01,00:24:26:01,It was cool.
922,00:24:34:03,00:24:34:03,">> I know, bud."
923,00:24:34:25,00:24:34:25,"What\'s up, Gary?"
924,00:24:35:17,00:24:35:17,>> How\'s it going?
925,00:24:36:15,00:24:36:15,>> Good. How was your...
926,00:24:37:23,00:24:37:23,How was the food?
927,00:24:38:18,00:24:38:18,>> It was all right.
928,00:24:39:20,00:24:39:20,>> Good food?
929,00:24:40:07,00:24:40:07,">> You know, I don\'t know if"
930,00:24:41:23,00:24:41:23,"it\'s too late, but Judd really"
931,00:24:43:06,00:24:43:06,seemed to have fun.
932,00:24:44:05,00:24:44:05,Danni and Stephenie hit it off
933,00:24:45:16,00:24:45:16,immediately.
934,00:24:46:10,00:24:46:10,I don\'t know how sincere they
935,00:24:47:17,00:24:47:17,"were, but-but I made the pitch"
936,00:24:48:23,00:24:48:23,to them.
937,00:24:49:28,00:24:49:28,And they\'re either going to take
938,00:24:51:07,00:24:51:07,it or they\'re not.
939,00:24:52:02,00:24:52:02,"So, if I don\'t win immunity"
940,00:24:53:12,00:24:53:12,on the next challenge and it
941,00:24:54:22,00:24:54:22,"doesn\'t change, I\'ll be gone."
942,00:25:04:27,00:25:04:27,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
943,00:25:10:26,00:25:10:26,"Good morning, guys."
944,00:25:12:20,00:25:12:20,>> Good morning.
945,00:25:14:03,00:25:14:03,>> PROBST: First things first.
946,00:25:15:28,00:25:15:28,"Jamie, give it up."
947,00:25:23:06,00:25:23:06,"Once again, immunity is back up"
948,00:25:25:06,00:25:25:06,for grabs.
949,00:25:26:08,00:25:26:08,Ready to get to the challenge?
950,00:25:28:02,00:25:28:02,Here is how it works.
951,00:25:29:12,00:25:29:12,You will be attached to one long
952,00:25:31:11,00:25:31:11,"rope, which is threaded through"
953,00:25:33:08,00:25:33:08,three obstacles.
954,00:25:34:07,00:25:34:07,"You will have to climb over,"
955,00:25:36:05,00:25:36:05,"crawl under, maneuver around as"
956,00:25:38:02,00:25:38:02,you race through these
957,00:25:39:01,00:25:39:01,obstacles.
958,00:25:40:01,00:25:40:01,The first four to the finish
959,00:25:41:21,00:25:41:21,move on to the final round.
960,00:25:43:10,00:25:43:10,"For the final round, you will"
961,00:25:44:28,00:25:44:28,once again be attached to one
962,00:25:46:06,00:25:46:06,rope.
963,00:25:47:03,00:25:47:03,"Only this time, the obstacle is"
964,00:25:48:16,00:25:48:16,"three levels high, and that will"
965,00:25:50:12,00:25:50:12,seriously complicate things.
966,00:25:52:06,00:25:52:06,First person to finish wins
967,00:25:53:22,00:25:53:22,immunity.
968,00:25:55:01,00:25:55:01,Guarantees themself a one-in-
969,00:25:57:21,00:25:57:21,seven shot at $1 million.
970,00:26:02:00,00:26:02:00,We\'ll draw for position and
971,00:26:03:03,00:26:03:03,we\'ll get started.
972,00:26:07:08,00:26:07:08,Here we go.
973,00:26:08:12,00:26:08:12,"For immunity, survivors ready?"
974,00:26:11:03,00:26:11:03,Go!
975,00:26:12:20,00:26:12:20,Gary wasting no time.
976,00:26:14:20,00:26:14:20,Rafe doing well.
977,00:26:16:02,00:26:16:02,Cindy right in there.
978,00:26:17:17,00:26:17:17,Danni trailing behind.
979,00:26:19:25,00:26:19:25,Judd having trouble figuring it
980,00:26:21:03,00:26:21:03,out.
981,00:26:22:13,00:26:22:13,He\'s bringing up the tail.
982,00:26:23:25,00:26:23:25,Lydia throwing herself over this
983,00:26:25:03,00:26:25:03,obstacle.
984,00:26:26:11,00:26:26:11,Does not want to be last again.
985,00:26:28:05,00:26:28:05,Gary the first to move on to the
986,00:26:29:16,00:26:29:16,second obstacle.
987,00:26:30:23,00:26:30:23,Cindy and Steph are neck and

992,00:26:37:00,00:26:37:00,"Rafe, Jamie fighting for that"
993,00:26:38:05,00:26:38:05,fourth spot.
994,00:26:40:05,00:26:40:05,Rafe now at the second pole.

996,00:26:44:25,00:26:44:25,Rafe now looking to be the final
997,00:26:46:07,00:26:46:07,four.
998,00:26:47:11,00:26:47:11,I forgot about Danni.
999,00:26:49:02,00:26:49:02,"Danni is on the ground, almost"
1000,00:26:51:02,00:26:51:02,out of sight.
1001,00:26:54:22,00:26:54:22,Gary has moved on to the third
1002,00:26:56:01,00:26:56:01,"stage, the big lead."
1003,00:26:58:16,00:26:58:16,Four people are moving on to the

1005,00:27:01:02,00:27:01:02,Immunity at stake.

1007,00:27:05:06,00:27:05:06,with the second pole.
1008,00:27:06:28,00:27:06:28,Not as easy as it looks.
1009,00:27:09:10,00:27:09:10,Rafe picking up some ground.
1010,00:27:12:10,00:27:12:10,"Danni, Judd, Lydia are falling"

1019,00:27:29:11,00:27:29:11,now.
1020,00:27:30:20,00:27:30:20,Gary still in the lead.
1021,00:27:32:03,00:27:32:03,Judd has given up.
1022,00:27:34:16,00:27:34:16,>> I\'m not giving up.
1023,00:27:35:21,00:27:35:21,I\'m-I\'m trying to figure it out.

1028,00:27:45:06,00:27:45:06,stage to have a shot.
1029,00:27:46:12,00:27:46:12,Gary ran into a bit of an

1038,00:28:01:25,00:28:01:25,What happened?
1039,00:28:03:01,00:28:03:01,Things were going smoothly.
1040,00:28:05:03,00:28:05:03,He\'s not panicking.
1041,00:28:06:02,00:28:06:02,Taking his time.
1042,00:28:07:25,00:28:07:25,Cindy nowhere closer to that

1089,00:29:27:05,00:29:27:05,"Cindy and Rafe, dead even."
1090,00:29:29:03,00:29:29:03,"When Cindy starts to move, she"
1091,00:29:31:07,00:29:31:07,flies.
1092,00:29:32:05,00:29:32:05,Steph close behind.
1093,00:29:34:03,00:29:34:03,Jamie trying to get back into
1094,00:29:35:11,00:29:35:11,it; he\'s figured it out now.
1095,00:29:36:26,00:29:36:26,Cindy now with a bit of a lead.
1096,00:29:42:07,00:29:42:07,"Rafe right behind, not giving"
1097,00:29:44:07,00:29:44:07,"up, still very tight."
1098,00:29:46:16,00:29:46:16,One slip-up can cost you.
1099,00:29:48:28,00:29:48:28,Cindy moving quickly.
1100,00:29:50:28,00:29:50:28,She\'s into the fourth section.
1101,00:29:53:10,00:29:53:10,Rafe slowing down.
1102,00:29:54:28,00:29:54:28,It\'s Cindy\'s to lose now.
1103,00:29:57:02,00:29:57:02,Rafe trying to make up some
1104,00:29:59:05,00:29:59:05,time.
1105,00:30:01:01,00:30:01:01,Cindy flying through this
1106,00:30:02:13,00:30:02:13,obstacle.
1107,00:30:03:20,00:30:03:20,Rafe fighting to stay in it.
1108,00:30:07:03,00:30:07:03,"It\'s Cindy and Rafe right now,"
1109,00:30:08:26,00:30:08:26,immunity on the line.
1110,00:30:10:22,00:30:10:22,Cindy is stuck.
1111,00:30:12:26,00:30:12:26,Cindy has lost her lead.
1112,00:30:15:02,00:30:15:02,Cindy now picks up.
1113,00:30:17:03,00:30:17:03,"Once again, it\'s going to be a"
1114,00:30:18:16,00:30:18:16,close finish.
1115,00:30:19:23,00:30:19:23,Cindy and Rafe.
1116,00:30:21:02,00:30:21:02,Rafe... wins immunity!
1117,00:30:23:28,00:30:23:28,(applause)
1118,00:30:25:06,00:30:25:06,>> Good job.
1119,00:30:26:20,00:30:26:20,">> Thanks, guys."
1120,00:30:32:06,00:30:32:06,">> PROBST: Rafe, come on over."
1121,00:30:34:01,00:30:34:01,">> Good job, Rafe."
1122,00:30:38:25,00:30:38:25,>> PROBST: Rafe is safe tonight
1123,00:30:40:01,00:30:40:01,at Tribal Council.
1124,00:30:41:20,00:30:41:20,One of you seven is going home.
1125,00:30:43:01,00:30:43:01,Back to camp.
1126,00:30:44:05,00:30:44:05,See you tonight at Tribal
1127,00:30:45:02,00:30:45:02,Council.
1128,00:31:05:03,00:31:05:03,">> Good job, Rafe."
1129,00:31:06:26,00:31:06:26,>> Thank you.
1130,00:31:08:06,00:31:08:06,">> Good job, Rafe."
1131,00:31:09:02,00:31:09:02,>> It\'s crazy.
1132,00:31:09:28,00:31:09:28,Of the three immunities I have
1133,00:31:11:12,00:31:11:12,"competed in, I\'ve won two and"
1134,00:31:13:00,00:31:13:00,finished second in one of them.
1135,00:31:14:15,00:31:14:15,"Um... you know, I just made"
1136,00:31:16:00,00:31:16:00,myself a huge threat in this
1137,00:31:17:10,00:31:17:10,game.
1138,00:31:18:01,00:31:18:01,And I think I am going to have
1139,00:31:19:26,00:31:19:26,to change the way I am playing.
1140,00:31:21:07,00:31:21:07,">> I got stuck, I couldn\'t fit"
1141,00:31:22:26,00:31:22:26,my shoulders through.
1142,00:31:23:27,00:31:23:27,">> Well, you\'re-you\'re tall."
1143,00:31:25:05,00:31:25:05,>> I got stuck.
1144,00:31:26:02,00:31:26:02,>> I would\'ve thought it would
1145,00:31:27:12,00:31:27:12,have been terrible for you.
1146,00:31:28:26,00:31:28:26,>> I didn\'t win immunity
1147,00:31:29:26,00:31:29:26,challenge.
1148,00:31:30:13,00:31:30:13,I was way out in the lead and
1149,00:31:32:00,00:31:32:00,couldn\'t get my body through a
1150,00:31:33:11,00:31:33:11,little hole.
1151,00:31:35:11,00:31:35:11,"So, that was tough."
1152,00:31:36:20,00:31:36:20,But I gave it my best shot.
1153,00:31:38:11,00:31:38:11,I went out fighting.
1154,00:31:39:23,00:31:39:23,And you never know.
1155,00:31:45:28,00:31:45:28,>> Huh?
1156,00:31:46:25,00:31:46:25,>> Making sure we\'re all good.
1157,00:31:48:07,00:31:48:07,>> Mm-hmm.
1158,00:31:49:02,00:31:49:02,We\'re going to vote for Gary
1159,00:31:50:11,00:31:50:11,tonight.
1160,00:31:51:08,00:31:51:08,Jamie\'s just very paranoid.
1161,00:31:53:07,00:31:53:07,"I mean, he\'s not going anywhere."
1162,00:31:55:05,00:31:55:05,He might get maybe...
1163,00:31:58:26,00:31:58:26,"one vote, from Gary."
1164,00:32:02:05,00:32:02:05,And that\'s it.
1165,00:32:08:01,00:32:08:01,">> Oh, yeah."
1166,00:32:10:07,00:32:10:07,">> I mean, I thought it was"
1167,00:32:11:15,00:32:11:15,"actually a fun challenge, but..."
1168,00:32:13:03,00:32:13:03,>> I thought it was good.
1169,00:32:14:08,00:32:14:08,>> Yeah.
1170,00:32:15:05,00:32:15:05,>> Freaking workout.
1171,00:32:16:01,00:32:16:01,My legs are killing me right
1172,00:32:17:12,00:32:17:12,now.
1173,00:32:18:07,00:32:18:07,>> My arms are.
1174,00:32:19:01,00:32:19:01,>> Yeah.
1175,00:32:19:25,00:32:19:25,">> So, I didn\'t win immunity"
1176,00:32:21:05,00:32:21:05,today; Rafe did.
1177,00:32:22:02,00:32:22:02,But he is not the serious threat
1178,00:32:23:28,00:32:23:28,right now; it\'s Gary.
1179,00:32:25:07,00:32:25:07,"And eventually, they\'re gonna"
1180,00:32:26:27,00:32:26:27,catch on that I\'m the serious
1181,00:32:28:07,00:32:28:07,threat.
1182,00:32:29:07,00:32:29:07,So I\'m trying to work it where
1183,00:32:30:23,00:32:30:23,"they, uh, keep the six that got"
1184,00:32:32:17,00:32:32:17,here together.
1185,00:32:34:17,00:32:34:17,And I\'m working that card a lot.
1186,00:32:39:20,00:32:39:20,We\'re still sticking to the
1187,00:32:40:22,00:32:40:22,plan?
1188,00:32:42:01,00:32:42:01,>> As far as I know.
1189,00:32:42:27,00:32:42:27,Haven\'t heard anything else.
1190,00:32:44:02,00:32:44:02,Is there anything else for me to
1191,00:32:45:21,00:32:45:21,know?
1192,00:32:46:22,00:32:46:22,>> I just... I-I don\'t want to
1193,00:32:48:06,00:32:48:06,go home tonight.
1194,00:32:49:12,00:32:49:12,"I\'m sticking with the six, you"
1195,00:32:51:05,00:32:51:05,know?
1196,00:32:52:05,00:32:52:05,>> We said we would.
1197,00:32:53:03,00:32:53:03,I don\'t see...
1198,00:32:53:23,00:32:53:23,>> Yeah.
1199,00:32:54:15,00:32:54:15,>> It\'s working so far.
1200,00:32:55:13,00:32:55:13,>> I know Lydia and Judd won\'t
1201,00:32:56:21,00:32:56:21,change; I know Rafe pretty much
1202,00:32:57:28,00:32:57:28,won\'t change.
1203,00:32:59:03,00:32:59:03,"You know, I just..."
1204,00:32:59:21,00:32:59:21,Sometimes I wonder what
1205,00:33:00:19,00:33:00:19,"Stephenie\'s thinking, you know?"
1206,00:33:01:26,00:33:01:26,Do you ever get like that or no?
1207,00:33:03:05,00:33:03:05,">> Yeah, you got to wonder what"
1208,00:33:04:20,00:33:04:20,everybody\'s thinking.
1209,00:33:05:17,00:33:05:17,"But you know, we said we\'d do"
1210,00:33:06:26,00:33:06:26,the six and it\'s working out for
1211,00:33:08:05,00:33:08:05,"us, so why screw it up now?"
1212,00:33:09:01,00:33:09:01,>> Good...
1213,00:33:10:02,00:33:10:02,>> No reason.
1214,00:33:10:26,00:33:10:26,>> I appreciate that a lot.
1215,00:33:12:05,00:33:12:05,\'Cause I\'m-I\'m kind of scared
1216,00:33:13:06,00:33:13:06,"now, just in case, you know..."
1217,00:33:14:12,00:33:14:12,">> For me personally, Jamie\'s"
1218,00:33:15:23,00:33:15:23,paranoia is just getting crazy.
1219,00:33:17:01,00:33:17:01,He just doesn\'t know when to be
1220,00:33:18:16,00:33:18:16,quiet.
1221,00:33:20:16,00:33:20:16,"It just seems ridiculous, and"
1222,00:33:22:08,00:33:22:08,it\'s getting old.
1223,00:33:28:02,00:33:28:02,>> Sure.
1224,00:33:43:23,00:33:43:23,>> Jamie is such a control
1225,00:33:45:05,00:33:45:05,freak.
1226,00:33:46:03,00:33:46:03,"He\'ll come over and say, ""Rafe,"
1227,00:33:47:20,00:33:47:20,"let\'s go play Guatemancala,"""
1228,00:33:49:01,00:33:49:01,which has become his signal for
1229,00:33:50:18,00:33:50:18,"""Rafe, I need to talk to you"
1230,00:33:52:01,00:33:52:01,"about the game."""
1231,00:33:52:22,00:33:52:22,So I have to play Mancala with
1232,00:33:54:02,00:33:54:02,him every day.
1233,00:34:01:26,00:34:01:26,">> I mean, like, I don\'t know"
1234,00:34:03:07,00:34:03:07,what to tell you.
1235,00:34:03:28,00:34:03:28,You\'re constantly asking.
1236,00:34:05:03,00:34:05:03,"He\'s, like, ""So you\'re sticking"
1237,00:34:06:03,00:34:06:03,"with the six, right?"
1238,00:34:07:06,00:34:07:06,Are you going to stick with the
1239,00:34:08:11,00:34:08:11,six?
1240,00:34:09:02,00:34:09:02,"You should stick with the six,"
1241,00:34:10:07,00:34:10:07,right?
1242,00:34:11:03,00:34:11:03,I\'m just worried that everyone\'s
1243,00:34:12:06,00:34:12:06,not going to stick with the
1244,00:34:13:08,00:34:13:08,"six."""
1245,00:34:14:05,00:34:14:05,"I\'m like ""Jamie, I\'m sticking"
1246,00:34:15:03,00:34:15:03,with the six.
1247,00:34:15:25,00:34:15:25,"Like, if you ask me again I\'m"
1248,00:34:17:00,00:34:17:00,going to die.
1249,00:34:17:20,00:34:17:20,I\'m going to throw these pieces
1250,00:34:18:23,00:34:18:23,of corn at you.
1251,00:34:19:12,00:34:19:12,I-I... You\'re driving me
1252,00:34:20:05,00:34:20:05,"insane."""
1253,00:34:29:05,00:34:29:05,>> Okay.
1254,00:34:32:01,00:34:32:01,>> Okay.
1255,00:35:13:26,00:35:13:26,">> I don\'t know what to say, you"
1256,00:35:15:12,00:35:15:12,"know, I mean..."
1257,00:35:16:23,00:35:16:23,It\'s a hard decision.
1258,00:35:18:12,00:35:18:12,"Jamie and I, we have been"
1259,00:35:20:17,00:35:20:17,together since day one.
1260,00:35:22:11,00:35:22:11,"So it\'s very, very difficult for"
1261,00:35:24:05,00:35:24:05,me to think about voting him
1262,00:35:25:13,00:35:25:13,off.
1263,00:35:33:03,00:35:33:03,>> Mm-hmm.
1264,00:35:41:12,00:35:41:12,>> Gary is a smooth operator.
1265,00:35:47:20,00:35:47:20,>> I-I think we should do it.
1266,00:35:49:07,00:35:49:07,">> Okay, that\'s what my heart"
1267,00:35:51:02,00:35:51:02,"says, too."
1268,00:35:52:07,00:35:52:07,">> What do you think, Lydia?"
1269,00:35:55:03,00:35:55:03,">> You guys want Jamie to go,"
1270,00:35:56:18,00:35:56:18,right?
1271,00:36:27:22,00:36:27:22,>> PROBST: We will now bring in
1272,00:36:29:07,00:36:29:07,the first member of our jury:
1273,00:36:30:17,00:36:30:17,"Bobby Jon, voted out at the last"
1274,00:36:32:01,00:36:32:01,Tribal Council.
1275,00:36:37:12,00:36:37:12,Jury members are here to listen
1276,00:36:38:23,00:36:38:23,in.
1277,00:36:39:21,00:36:39:21,You\'re not to direct any
1278,00:36:41:05,00:36:41:05,comments to them.
1279,00:36:42:06,00:36:42:06,They\'re gathering information to
1280,00:36:44:00,00:36:44:00,make a very big vote.
1281,00:36:45:07,00:36:45:07,"So, let\'s talk about the reward"
1282,00:36:47:00,00:36:47:00,first.
1283,00:36:48:02,00:36:48:02,"Steph, the biggest reward we\'ve"
1284,00:36:49:26,00:36:49:26,had so far.
1285,00:36:51:08,00:36:51:08,And did it give you time to bond
1286,00:36:54:00,00:36:54:00,with Gary and with Danni and
1287,00:36:56:02,00:36:56:02,with Judd?
1288,00:36:57:02,00:36:57:02,">> Yeah, it absolutely did."
1289,00:36:58:06,00:36:58:06,"I mean, we just enjoyed each"
1290,00:36:59:13,00:36:59:13,other\'s company and just really
1291,00:37:00:27,00:37:00:27,got to know each other.
1292,00:37:01:25,00:37:01:25,And especially for Gary.
1293,00:37:02:26,00:37:02:26,"I mean, he almost went home the"
1294,00:37:04:07,00:37:04:07,day before.
1295,00:37:05:20,00:37:05:20,"So, you know, we really kind of"
1296,00:37:07:01,00:37:07:01,bonded.
1297,00:37:08:02,00:37:08:02,So that was cool.
