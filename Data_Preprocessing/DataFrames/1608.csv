2,00:00:02.50,00:00:02.50,Survivor... >> Yes!
3,00:00:05.12,00:00:05.12,>> PROBST: ...despite winning challenges...
4,00:00:06.54,00:00:06.54,Airai wins! ...the Airai tribe was losing
5,00:00:08.83,00:00:08.83,"players. First, Jonathan."
6,00:00:11.62,00:00:11.62,>> I can't be here one more minute.
7,00:00:13.21,00:00:13.21,">> PROBST: Then Kathy. On Exile Island, Ozzy found the"
8,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,hidden immunity idol and replaced it with a fake one as a
9,00:00:20.04,00:00:20.04,"decoy, which was discovered by Jason."
10,00:00:23.33,00:00:23.33,">> There we go, baby. I guess this is the hidden"
11,00:00:26.71,00:00:26.71,"immunity idol. >> PROBST: At Malakal, Ozzy"
12,00:00:29.08,00:00:29.08,practically adopted Erik. >> They're like The Lion King--
13,00:00:32.88,00:00:32.88,"the father, when he was teaching the cub."
14,00:00:35.25,00:00:35.25,">> PROBST: So when his tribe was facing tribal council, he knew"
15,00:00:38.00,00:00:38.00,exactly who he wanted to vote out.
16,00:00:39.88,00:00:39.88,>> I don't think that there's any argument for keeping Tracy.
17,00:00:43.04,00:00:43.04,>> PROBST: But Ami saw a chance to turn against the favorites
18,00:00:45.62,00:00:45.62,and go after Ozzy. >> Sometimes you have to pull
19,00:00:48.21,00:00:48.21,the dirty cards to stay in the game.
20,00:00:50.67,00:00:50.67,">> PROBST: Tracy also went after Ozzy, warning everyone that he's"
21,00:00:53.54,00:00:53.54,not only the tribe leader but the biggest threat.
22,00:00:56.50,00:00:56.50,>> I think I'd be a better tribe member than somebody that's
23,00:00:58.96,00:00:58.96,going to demolish you if you do go to the merge.
24,00:01:01.50,00:01:01.50,">> PROBST: But in the end, Ami sided with the favorites."
25,00:01:04.17,00:01:04.17,"Seventh person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,"
26,00:01:06.08,00:01:06.08,"Tracy. And Tracy was sent home, leaving"
27,00:01:09.17,00:01:09.17,Erik as the only remaining fan on the Malakal tribe.
28,00:01:14.46,00:01:14.46,11 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
29,00:01:40.04,00:01:40.04,">> Tonight at tribal, Tracy went home."
30,00:01:42.88,00:01:42.88,"I feel lucky to be here still. I feel really, really lucky to"
31,00:01:45.58,00:01:45.58,still be here and have a shot at this game.
32,00:01:48.58,00:01:48.58,"But I am scared to death, because I'm the last fan left,"
33,00:01:53.54,00:01:53.54,and I don't think I see any leeway with these favorites.
34,00:01:57.17,00:01:57.17,"I feel like I'm the next to go, no matter what happens now in"
35,00:02:00.62,00:02:00.62,"the future. >> Here, scratch my back."
36,00:02:19.58,00:02:19.58,>> Tribal council was a little bit of an eye opener.
37,00:02:22.17,00:02:22.17,Tracy described me as the leader.
38,00:02:24.33,00:02:24.33,I really don't think that I'm the leader.
39,00:02:27.29,00:02:27.29,I just think that I've got a lot of good opinions and a lot of
40,00:02:31.17,00:02:31.17,"know-how when it comes to surviving out here, and people"
41,00:02:34.21,00:02:34.21,respect that. Even though I think I'm a
42,00:02:37.21,00:02:37.21,"valuable asset, I'm going to have a giant target on my back."
43,00:02:40.17,00:02:40.17,And that's the kind of situation that I want to avoid.

46,00:04:13.62,00:04:13.62,">> Careful, Ami. >> Get him!"
47,00:04:26.04,00:04:26.04,">> Come on! No, no, no!"
48,00:04:30.00,00:04:30.00,Go in there! Nice work.
49,00:04:38.58,00:04:38.58,All right. This will give a girl a heart
50,00:04:41.04,00:04:41.04,attack. That was fun this morning.
51,00:04:54.46,00:04:54.46,">> Uh-huh. >> Ozzy's like, ""Did you guys"
52,00:04:56.17,00:04:56.17,"get anything?"" ""No, not really, just eight"
53,00:05:00.08,00:05:00.08,"crabs."" >> You guys did awesome!"
54,00:05:04.08,00:05:04.08,>> We're the crab warriors. >> That's crazy!
55,00:05:07.04,00:05:07.04,"Girl, give me some sugar. >> Well, don't let it get to you"
56,00:05:16.21,00:05:16.21,"yet. >> Well, who cares about that"
57,00:05:24.50,00:05:24.50,stuff? Don't worry about that.
58,00:05:33.58,00:05:33.58,">> Like, last night, Tracy was trying everything in her power"
59,00:05:37.25,00:05:37.25,to get you to get voted off. She was coming to me.
60,00:05:40.33,00:05:40.33,"She was coming to Cirie. She's, like, trying everything."
61,00:05:42.33,00:05:42.33,Who cares? I stopped anything crazy from
62,00:05:44.42,00:05:44.42,happening. Yeah.
63,00:05:52.21,00:05:52.21,">> Tracy is sneaky. >> It's not that big of a deal,"
64,00:05:56.08,00:05:56.08,"you know. It didn't happen, and it's not"
65,00:05:57.92,00:05:57.92,"going to happen, so don't worry about it."
66,00:06:00.58,00:06:00.58,"Okay? >> This morning, Ami ended up"
67,00:06:04.08,00:06:04.08,telling me that she was approached by Tracy and asked to
68,00:06:07.00,00:06:07.00,"vote for me, but she said, you know, that she wasn't going to"
69,00:06:11.21,00:06:11.21,do that and she's on my side. >> You're not in any danger.
70,00:06:13.79,00:06:13.79,"Like, let it go. >> It's just the tribal council"
71,00:06:15.71,00:06:15.71,last night was kind of like... >> I'm not leaving you.
72,00:06:18.08,00:06:18.08,>> But Ami's a little too adamant about that.
73,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,"And as much as she says she's on my side, I'm starting to get"
74,00:06:23.25,00:06:23.25,uneasy feelings. >> I was dreaming about pizza
75,00:06:38.96,00:06:38.96,that I just put in an oven. >> Fluffy on top.
76,00:06:43.08,00:06:43.08,>> Yeah. Mm!
77,00:06:45.58,00:06:45.58,I just don't want another bite of coconut.
78,00:06:47.42,00:06:47.42,"I just don't. >> Oh, my God."
79,00:07:20.83,00:07:20.83,">> Ah, you got him! Oh, my God!"
80,00:07:23.17,00:07:23.17,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God."
81,00:07:24.88,00:07:24.88,">> Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
82,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
83,00:07:28.88,00:07:28.88,James! >> What?
84,00:07:30.75,00:07:30.75,>> He caught a rat! >> I cannot believe you just
85,00:07:34.79,00:07:34.79,"caught a rat. >> Oh, poor guy."
86,00:07:38.25,00:07:38.25,"Get the shish kebab and just, like..."
87,00:07:40.08,00:07:40.08,">> Oh. >> There's nothing on him,"
88,00:07:42.62,00:07:42.62,"though, really. I think I'm going to feel a"
89,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,"little bad eating the rat. You know, he's a small guy."
90,00:07:47.12,00:07:47.12,"There's not much meat on there. But you know, out here, we're in"
91,00:07:49.92,00:07:49.92,"the bush, and it's survival of the fittest."
92,00:07:52.08,00:07:52.08,"So yeah, I'm going to dig into the rat and give it a shot."
93,00:07:55.04,00:07:55.04,"We'll stick a skewer through him, barbecue him up."
94,00:07:57.58,00:07:57.58,"Nobody has eaten a rat since the first season of Survivor, so"
95,00:08:00.38,00:08:00.38,it's kind of cool. I'll be able to bring that
96,00:08:02.42,00:08:02.42,"tradition back. >> Ew, look at his tail."
97,00:08:04.88,00:08:04.88,He's so yuck. >> I sure the tail is delicious.
98,00:08:08.88,00:08:08.88,>> Have you ever had a rat before?
99,00:08:10.21,00:08:10.21,>> Never. >> I think Jason's been trying
100,00:08:12.21,00:08:12.21,to impress the favorites ever since the switch up.
101,00:08:14.04,00:08:14.04,"It's not working, though. I think he's a loser."
102,00:08:26.21,00:08:26.21,>> This is a nightmare over here.
103,00:08:48.50,00:08:48.50,This island sucks. There's nothing but rock.
104,00:08:51.04,00:08:51.04,You don't have enough beach area.
105,00:08:53.12,00:08:53.12,You can't go anywhere. There's nothing.
106,00:08:55.17,00:08:55.17,It's like pretty much a barren land.
107,00:08:57.21,00:08:57.21,"You could live on Malakal. Over here, this is where they"
108,00:09:01.12,00:09:01.12,bring the criminals. >> I just want to go back to
109,00:09:03.17,00:09:03.17,Amanda. >> I just want to go back.
110,00:09:07.25,00:09:07.25,>> I want to go back to Amanda and Cirie and Oz.
111,00:09:10.04,00:09:10.04,>> This sucks. The original Malakal alliance
112,00:09:13.29,00:09:13.29,"was supposed to be myself, Amanda, Parvati, Ozzy, and"
113,00:09:16.83,00:09:16.83,"Cirie. But over here, it's just Parvati"
114,00:09:19.08,00:09:19.08,"and I. So, I mean, I'm at my wit's end."
115,00:09:27.12,00:09:27.12,>> Are you nervous? >> Not now.
116,00:09:29.12,00:09:29.12,>> Not now. And if we can make it back to
117,00:09:31.46,00:09:31.46,"the merge, we're fine. >> That would suck."
118,00:09:39.79,00:09:39.79,"At this point, six people are left in this tribe, so we need a"
119,00:09:42.96,00:09:42.96,very solid four to go into the merge.
120,00:09:45.38,00:09:45.38,So me and James are really going to have to pull in two more
121,00:09:48.25,00:09:48.25,"people, you know, in order to remain in a strong position in"
122,00:09:51.92,00:09:51.92,this tribe. This is how I came into this
123,00:09:55.21,00:09:55.21,"game, to play in stages. Like, the first stage was,"
124,00:09:58.54,00:09:58.54,"clearly, before the mix-up, when it was fans versus favorites,"
125,00:10:01.46,00:10:01.46,"and just to get through that, the first couple of votes."
126,00:10:03.75,00:10:03.75,And then we have the mix-up. So we have to play through this
127,00:10:06.88,00:10:06.88,segment to get to the merge. I just feel like I would feel
128,00:10:10.29,00:10:10.29,"safe if it was you and Alexis, me and James locked up at four,"
129,00:10:15.62,00:10:15.62,a block of four. >> Yeah.
130,00:10:17.21,00:10:17.21,I will work with you. >> Okay.
131,00:10:20.17,00:10:20.17,">> I think that James, we can still win immunity."
132,00:10:22.21,00:10:22.21,">> I think with James, we're fine until the merge."
133,00:10:25.67,00:10:25.67,"And then once we get to the merge, all of the targets are"
134,00:10:29.08,00:10:29.08,"going to be on the big guys. Like, we're going to be able to"
135,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,slip under because everyone's going to be so threatened by the
136,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,"big guys trying to get them out. >> Ozzy, James."
137,00:10:37.04,00:10:37.04,>> Ozzy and James are probably going to be the first to go.
138,00:10:39.46,00:10:39.46,>> I'm down. >> I wouldn't see anything wrong
139,00:10:42.29,00:10:42.29,"with it being y'all two, me, and Amanda final four."
140,00:10:46.38,00:10:46.38,">> Yeah, how hot would that be? >> You know?"
141,00:10:49.46,00:10:49.46,"I'm not going to win against Ozzy, and I'm not going to win"
142,00:10:51.17,00:10:51.17,against James. There's no way.
143,00:10:53.21,00:10:53.21,"I love them. I love having them around, but I"
144,00:10:55.25,00:10:55.25,don't want to go up against them at the end.
145,00:10:57.50,00:10:57.50,So I might just go ahead and pull in Alexis and Natalie and
146,00:11:00.46,00:11:00.46,take them with me and Amanda to the four.
147,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,"Everyone else, they're dead to me."
148,00:11:21.67,00:11:21.67,">> Oh. >> Oh, my God."
149,00:11:25.04,00:11:25.04,"""Choose one player from the Malakal tribe to sit out today's"
150,00:11:28.08,00:11:28.08,immunity challenge. The person you choose will be

159,00:11:52.12,00:11:52.12,>> Yeah. >> We just got tree mail and
160,00:11:54.42,00:11:54.42,"found out that we have an immunity challenge today, which"
161,00:11:57.29,00:11:57.29,"is kind of shocking, because we just had an immunity challenge"
162,00:11:59.75,00:11:59.75,yesterday. We had to pick one member of the
163,00:12:02.92,00:12:02.92,Malakal tribe to sit out of today's challenge and to get
164,00:12:07.42,00:12:07.42,individual immunity at tonight's tribal council.
165,00:12:09.83,00:12:09.83,This is huge. >> Whose name do you think

171,00:12:28.25,00:12:28.25,"And this piece says, ""Life here is like a balancing act with the"
172,00:12:32.83,00:12:32.83,"other tribe trying to knock you down."""
173,00:12:35.83,00:12:35.83,">> Oh, no! >> ""Win this one, you're safe"
174,00:12:38.04,00:12:38.04,"tonight, and it'll be your tribe who's chowing down."""
175,00:12:42.25,00:12:42.25,>> I think whoever wins the immunity challenge gets to go to
176,00:12:44.17,00:12:44.17,"a feast, and then the other tribe has to go to tribal"
177,00:12:46.38,00:12:46.38,"council. >> Not both, not both."
178,00:12:49.17,00:12:49.17,">> Right, right. >> So..."
179,00:12:51.75,00:12:51.75,>> Who do we want to sit out? >> Whoever is their best
180,00:12:54.17,00:12:54.17,balancer. >> If we go to tribal council
181,00:12:56.58,00:12:56.58,"tonight and I don't have immunity, I'm dead."
182,00:12:58.58,00:12:58.58,So I am hoping so much that I get some form of immunity here
183,00:13:03.75,00:13:03.75,and survive this tribal council tonight.

201,00:14:34.92,00:14:34.92,it was James. They changed it to Alexis.
202,00:14:41.08,00:14:41.08,"Ami, tell me about that. Why the change of heart?"
203,00:14:44.17,00:14:44.17,">> She seems like she could balance, and it seemed like it"
204,00:14:46.46,00:14:46.46,"was about balance, so we decided to get rid of Alexis."

209,00:15:05.58,00:15:05.58,>> PROBST: How about first you give me immunity back?
210,00:15:08.12,00:15:08.12,"How about that? Once again, immunity is back up"
211,00:15:13.71,00:15:13.71,"for grabs. On my go, one tribe member at a"

213,00:15:22.46,00:15:22.46,the other tribe attempt to knock you off by swinging heavy canvas
214,00:15:26.29,00:15:26.29,"bags. When you reach the end, you'll"
215,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,"grab a flag, try to make your way back."
216,00:15:31.21,00:15:31.21,"If you fall off at any point along the way, you have to make"

324,00:22:17.83,00:22:17.83,"great time. But right now, I definitely feel"
325,00:22:20.54,00:22:20.54,scared about my position over here.
326,00:22:23.08,00:22:23.08,"Luckily, I hold the hidden immunity idol."

333,00:22:43.25,00:22:43.25,"I think they both kind of know they're on the outs, so they"
334,00:22:45.12,00:22:45.12,"both gave it their all at this challenge, and they saved each"
335,00:22:47.21,00:22:47.21,other. And I am so happy.
336,00:22:52.12,00:22:52.12,I don't think I'll be having rat for dinner tonight.

378,00:25:34.25,00:25:34.25,"challenges than he is here. >> Oh, definitely."
379,00:25:36.29,00:25:36.29,>> You know what I'm saying? >> I want to stay in this game
380,00:25:51.04,00:25:51.04,very badly. I've seen so many seasons of
381,00:25:55.17,00:25:55.17,this show. It's killing me right now that
382,00:25:57.21,00:25:57.21,"I'm this close to maybe making the next level, making the next"
383,00:26:01.38,00:26:01.38,set of alliances that can lead me to the end of this game.
384,00:26:05.42,00:26:05.42,"I feel like I'm on my last legs, though."
385,00:26:07.38,00:26:07.38,"I mean, all the fans are dead in this tribe."
386,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,All the favorites have the control.
387,00:26:12.12,00:26:12.12,"But I'm trying to work with what I have, and I'm pretty desperate"
388,00:26:15.04,00:26:15.04,right now. How well do you guys trust Ami?
389,00:26:24.62,00:26:24.62,>> Huh? >> How well do you guys trust
390,00:26:26.04,00:26:26.04,Ami? >> I don't know.
391,00:26:29.08,00:26:29.08,Why? >> Because she's been trying to
392,00:26:31.12,00:26:31.12,get something together with Airai since probably Joel left.
393,00:26:35.50,00:26:35.50,"And when Chet was here, she wanted to go with us to vote one"
394,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,"of you guys. And then when it was just Tracy,"
395,00:26:41.54,00:26:41.54,"me, and her, she tried to sway one of you guys, and that didn't"
396,00:26:46.04,00:26:46.04,"happen, so Tracy left. ( laughter )"
397,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,She's told me about different alliances that you guys have
398,00:26:52.38,00:26:52.38,had. She said that she was part of
399,00:26:54.25,00:26:54.25,"Yau-Man's alliance, and she said she had nowhere to go, and"
400,00:26:57.62,00:26:57.62,that's why she came to me and Chet and Tracy.
401,00:27:02.21,00:27:02.21,"I really don't want to hurt her, because I really like Ami a lot."
402,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,I like Ami a lot. She's such a good person.
403,00:27:07.08,00:27:07.08,But this isn't about people anymore.
404,00:27:08.96,00:27:08.96,">> Right, right. >> This is about the game."
405,00:27:10.25,00:27:10.25,>> Uh-huh. >> And I want you guys to know
406,00:27:12.17,00:27:12.17,"that if you decide Ami, I'll be in with that."
407,00:27:22.21,00:27:22.21,>> Wow. You don't know who to trust
408,00:27:24.12,00:27:24.12,here. You have Erik fighting for his
409,00:27:26.50,00:27:26.50,"life, who will say anything right now, who will sell his"
410,00:27:29.79,00:27:29.79,"soul to the devil to stay. And then you have Ami, who has"
411,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,proven time and time again that she can't be trusted-- that I
412,00:27:38.25,00:27:38.25,can't trust her. >> I'm trying to save my neck
413,00:27:40.50,00:27:40.50,here. So that's why I do whatever.
414,00:27:54.33,00:27:54.33,"That's all I have. Take it, leave it, pretend it's"
415,00:27:57.96,00:27:57.96,"lies, whatever, but that's everything that I've heard."
416,00:28:01.71,00:28:01.71,">> See, the problem is I don't trust Ami, but I don't trust"
417,00:28:06.17,00:28:06.17,Erik either. So my dilemma is who do I trust
418,00:28:10.12,00:28:10.12,"the least? So I was walking down the beach,"
419,00:28:43.04,00:28:43.04,"and I came back to camp, and there's Erik just spilling the"
420,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,"beans, just going out about every single thing that's gone"
421,00:28:49.54,00:28:49.54,down since the swap. I don't feel like I've done
422,00:28:54.12,00:28:54.12,"anything to hurt you, have you? I've stuck by you 100%, and I"
423,00:28:58.04,00:28:58.04,always will. He's trying everything in his
424,00:29:04.33,00:29:04.33,"right mind... >> No, I understand."
425,00:29:06.00,00:29:06.00,I know. And I don't blame him.
426,00:29:08.04,00:29:08.04,">> No, neither do I. >> If I vote either Ami or Erik,"
427,00:29:12.00,00:29:12.00,it's going to be risky either way.
428,00:29:16.04,00:29:16.04,"Erik probably still has his alliance with the fans, and if"
429,00:29:19.58,00:29:19.58,"they could get Eliza, that could be a problem."
430,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,But it's the same thing with Ami.
431,00:29:25.79,00:29:25.79,"She could grab Eliza and go with Jason, Natalie, and Alexis and"
432,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,cause problems. So I don't know.
433,00:29:34.58,00:29:34.58,Just with all the skittishness and all the...
434,00:29:38.17,00:29:38.17,">> Well, you guys, I was the last one, period, to even be,"
435,00:29:42.08,00:29:42.08,"like, talked to about being with you guys."
436,00:29:45.08,00:29:45.08,You guys didn't ever even ask me.
437,00:29:46.75,00:29:46.75,">> I know, because we thought you were with Eliza and those"
438,00:29:48.33,00:29:48.33,"guys. >> Yeah, but I was."
439,00:29:49.62,00:29:49.62,>> I know. >> And then after that...
440,00:29:50.96,00:29:50.96,">> So why would we then? >> Well, yeah, but since then,"
441,00:29:56.00,00:29:56.00,"you guys have never come together and really said, ""Okay,"
442,00:29:58.21,00:29:58.21,"Ami, we want you to be really a part of this and totally into"
443,00:30:01.29,00:30:01.29,"this; like, we're watching your back, no matter what."""
444,00:30:05.04,00:30:05.04,I want to stick with you guys the whole way and feel like I'm
445,00:30:07.08,00:30:07.08,part of you guys. >> Right.
446,00:30:09.88,00:30:09.88,">> But nobody has really said, ""Hey, Ami, we want to fight with"
447,00:30:12.71,00:30:12.71,"you."" >> Well, we want to fight with"
448,00:30:14.96,00:30:14.96,"you. >> Okay, thanks."
449,00:30:20.62,00:30:20.62,>> We don't know Erik like we know Ami.
450,00:30:23.08,00:30:23.08,"Like, we know we can't trust Ami, and it's almost better with"
451,00:30:26.08,00:30:26.08,the devil you know rather than the devil you don't know.
452,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,"I feel like we should have, like, a group hug or something."
453,00:30:31.12,00:30:31.12,">> Okay, good, thanks. >> Oh."
454,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,"We just had a really good talk. >> That's what I wanted, yeah."
455,00:30:48.21,00:30:48.21,">> That's not what you wanted. >> That's not what I wanted,"
456,00:30:51.21,00:30:51.21,but... >> Right.
457,00:31:00.92,00:31:00.92,And so you... >> Well opening that up to them
458,00:31:02.92,00:31:02.92,to... >> Yeah.
459,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,Thank you. Thank you.
460,00:31:08.17,00:31:08.17,">> No problem. Things were looking pretty bad,"
461,00:31:12.62,00:31:12.62,and I still think they're looking pretty bad.
462,00:31:16.79,00:31:16.79,"I don't want to give up. I don't want to admit defeat,"
463,00:31:19.12,00:31:19.12,but it's so hard to keep going. We'll also have to see what Ozzy
464,00:31:23.29,00:31:23.29,has to say when he comes back from Exile.
465,00:31:26.21,00:31:26.21,I definitely want to talk to Ozzy about the future.
466,00:31:28.71,00:31:28.71,I definitely want to ask him about how he feels with his
467,00:31:31.38,00:31:31.38,alliance and how he feels about taking me with him.
468,00:31:35.17,00:31:35.17,>> How'd it go? No way!
469,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,Are you serious? >> Yeah.
470,00:31:54.62,00:31:54.62,">> Yeah. >> I came back from Exile, and"
471,00:32:01.21,00:32:01.21,"as soon as I jump off the boat, there was Erik looking like a"
472,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"lost puppy dog. He came right up to me and said,"
473,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,"""I know it's a long shot, but I've got to tell you something"
474,00:32:10.25,00:32:10.25,"about Ami."" >> Ami was trying to do"
475,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,"something with me, Tracy, and Chet."
476,00:32:16.33,00:32:16.33,"And then it was down to Tracy and me, she was trying to sway"
477,00:32:18.38,00:32:18.38,either Cirie or Amanda to do whatever.
478,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,>> So you're being totally honest that Ami was...
479,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,">> Yes, yes. >> Did Ami try and get me out?"
480,00:32:28.50,00:32:28.50,>> Yes. >> Okay.
481,00:32:30.54,00:32:30.54,>> I'm going to write down Ami tonight.
482,00:32:32.46,00:32:32.46,I just want you to know that. >> All right.
483,00:32:34.29,00:32:34.29,">> And I would like you to help me, as a fellow competitor, to"
484,00:32:36.88,00:32:36.88,stay in this game. >> Okay.
485,00:32:41.12,00:32:41.12,"The way I play this game, as soon as someone makes a move"
486,00:32:43.29,00:32:43.29,"against me, that's it. I'm going to do whatever I can"
487,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,to get them out as fast as I can.
488,00:32:48.04,00:32:48.04,"And that's what Ami did. Erik, on the other hand, given"
489,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"the opportunity, I think he will prove trustworthy, and I'm"
490,00:32:56.58,00:32:56.58,willing to take that chance and that risk.
491,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,">> And that makes sense, but... but I still think that Ami..."
492,00:33:15.67,00:33:15.67,>> We can't trust Ami at all. >> No?
493,00:33:18.08,00:33:18.08,>> No. >> Well...
494,00:33:19.58,00:33:19.58,>> You know what I found out from Erik?
495,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,Ami was trying to get me out. Ami's a lying little snot.
496,00:33:28.38,00:33:28.38,">> Who can we trust more, though?"
497,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33,>> Erik. >> I don't think so.
498,00:33:33.08,00:33:33.08,>> You think Ami? >> At least we know what Ami is
499,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,capable of and what she's here to... how she's here to play.
500,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,Erik is more dangerous than he appears.
501,00:33:41.04,00:33:41.04,>> So is Ami. >> I don't know.
502,00:34:08.46,00:34:08.46,">> PROBST: Four times in a row. Cirie, you're clearly the"
503,00:34:12.29,00:34:12.29,inferior tribe at this point. >> It's horrible.
504,00:34:17.38,00:34:17.38,We just can't figure out why we keep losing.
505,00:34:20.79,00:34:20.79,And it sucks around camp for morale for us.
506,00:34:25.21,00:34:25.21,">> PROBST: Erik, interesting situation you're in right now,"
507,00:34:28.00,00:34:28.00,because the last three people voted off have been fans.
508,00:34:30.50,00:34:30.50,There's only one fan left. >> I know.
509,00:34:33.83,00:34:33.83,"I understand that the fans have been going, one after another,"
510,00:34:37.00,00:34:37.00,and I understand that I could be the one tonight.
511,00:34:40.00,00:34:40.00,"I mean, I feel hopeless. A week ago, I was happy, and to"
512,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,"have it go this way, it baffles me."
513,00:34:46.83,00:34:46.83,">> PROBST: Ozzy, looks to me like it's favorites versus fans"
514,00:34:49.71,00:34:49.71,"still, in a lot of ways. >> Yeah, alliances were made to"
515,00:34:53.42,00:34:53.42,"people that you feel the most trust, and that's how we came to"
516,00:34:57.12,00:34:57.12,"be a tribe in the beginning, the favorites."
517,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"But all of a sudden, the game gets in the way, and the"
518,00:35:04.62,00:35:04.62,favorites that might feel they're at the bottom of the
519,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,"pecking order start playing the fans, start playing both sides"
520,00:35:11.29,00:35:11.29,"of the spectrum, and that's when it starts getting a little bit"
521,00:35:14.04,00:35:14.04,funky. And now I'm starting to realize
522,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,that certain things are not what they seem.
523,00:35:22.46,00:35:22.46,">> PROBST: Ami, you're tearing up."
524,00:35:24.38,00:35:24.38,">> Well, I obviously know Ozzy is talking about me right now."
525,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,>> Why would you think that? >> Because I know Erik has been
526,00:35:32.25,00:35:32.25,all day long saying how I've been playing both sides and all
527,00:35:35.21,00:35:35.21,"of that. >> To be honest, the day that"
528,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,"the fans arrived, Ami said, ""I need some help."
529,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,"You guys are numbers."" >> Yeah, I could have gone with"
530,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,those guys the first vote-- could have.
531,00:35:46.50,00:35:46.50,It would have been easy. We had the numbers to do it.
532,00:35:48.96,00:35:48.96,And I didn't. It's just now that finally I
533,00:35:52.12,00:35:52.12,"feel like I'm part of the tribe, you're telling me that,"
534,00:35:54.96,00:35:54.96,"""Whatever, I don't trust her, I don't believe her."""
535,00:35:57.92,00:35:57.92,>> How have we ever made you feel like you're not part of the
536,00:35:59.75,00:35:59.75,tribe? We've always been together.
537,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,We've always had the plan to try and keep us as strong as
538,00:36:05.29,00:36:05.29,possible as... >> But I haven't always felt
539,00:36:07.54,00:36:07.54,"like I'm part of the tribe. You guys go off, and you make"
540,00:36:09.88,00:36:09.88,decisions that you don't ask me about.
541,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,>> When? >> Like when you guys were
542,00:36:13.12,00:36:13.12,"making decisions for the first few times with everybody else,"
543,00:36:15.25,00:36:15.25,it didn't include me. You guys made the decisions.
544,00:36:17.88,00:36:17.88,>> I just want to know were you gunning for me with Tracy and
545,00:36:21.62,00:36:21.62,"Erik, or were you not? >> There is no way I would have"
546,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"ever voted for you with Tracy and Erik, ever."
547,00:36:27.46,00:36:27.46,"I was giving them hope and letting them have a good,"
548,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,"peaceful camp, and there is no way I would have ever voted for"
549,00:36:33.29,00:36:33.29,"you, ever, Ozzy. The only way I would vote for"
550,00:36:35.96,00:36:35.96,"you is to win the million dollars, period."
551,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,">> PROBST: Cirie, take me through the dilemma."
552,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,It's easy to keep with what you've been doing and get rid of
553,00:36:45.04,00:36:45.04,"the next fan, and we've still got four favorites together."
554,00:36:47.71,00:36:47.71,Now Ami's in question. How do you make a decision on
555,00:36:50.83,00:36:50.83,which way to go?-- because it's a huge vote.
556,00:36:53.54,00:36:53.54,>> I think all the favorites have a mutual respect for each
557,00:36:58.25,00:36:58.25,"other, and you know, it's like the home team."
558,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,You don't want the visitors to come in and win the game.
559,00:37:05.62,00:37:05.62,( sighing ) I think you just have to go with
560,00:37:08.50,00:37:08.50,"your gut feeling, what you'll believe and what you're not"
561,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,"going to believe. >> PROBST: Amanda, take me"
562,00:37:14.58,00:37:14.58,through the part of you that wants to believe Ami.
563,00:37:17.04,00:37:17.04,"Maybe Ami is telling the truth. >> I think Ami is, honestly,"
564,00:37:20.50,00:37:20.50,"like, a really good person. We've gotten close."
565,00:37:23.79,00:37:23.79,"We've been a tribe for 20-some days now, and I want to believe"
566,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,"what she's saying. >> PROBST: Ozzy, give me your"
567,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,"take on what's happening here. >> God, I really want to trust"
568,00:37:35.79,00:37:35.79,Ami. I really do.
569,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,"And I feel like I have, for the most part, for the whole, entire"
570,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,game. >> It just kills me that he says
571,00:37:44.83,00:37:44.83,he wants to. I can't believe that he doesn't.
572,00:37:49.75,00:37:49.75,">> PROBST: Clearly, tonight's vote is about one simple"
573,00:37:52.08,00:37:52.08,"quality: trust. Erik, why should they believe"
574,00:37:56.17,00:37:56.17,your story? >> I have no other option.
575,00:37:59.12,00:37:59.12,"I feel that I'm backed up against the wall, and I said,"
576,00:38:01.50,00:38:01.50,"""You know what? The truth is fine."""
577,00:38:03.42,00:38:03.42,And I have to tell it in hopes that they would see that and
578,00:38:06.12,00:38:06.12,"say, ""Yeah, Ami is not trustworthy,"" or, ""Ami is a"
579,00:38:08.88,00:38:08.88,"threat to the tribe well-being and to us, as individuals, after"
580,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,"the merge."" That's all I have."
581,00:38:14.46,00:38:14.46,That's all I have to give was that.
582,00:38:17.58,00:38:17.58,">> PROBST: Ami, why should this tribe believe your story?"
583,00:38:21.21,00:38:21.21,>> I'm going to set aside all the past of where I've voted and
584,00:38:23.67,00:38:23.67,what I've done and all that. They know where I'm coming from.
585,00:38:26.88,00:38:26.88,The biggest thing is is my heart is in this.
586,00:38:29.50,00:38:29.50,I want to fight for this tribe. I want to stick together.
587,00:38:32.38,00:38:32.38,I don't want to go out now. We have so much more that we can
588,00:38:35.83,00:38:35.83,conquer together. I want to fight as hard as I can
589,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,"in every challenge. I've looked you in the eyes, and"
590,00:38:41.33,00:38:41.33,you know you can trust me. I know you know it.
591,00:38:44.71,00:38:44.71,I know you know it without words.
592,00:38:46.79,00:38:46.79,And I know you do too. Erik is a really good guy.
593,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,He's doing the best he can. I have everything invested in
594,00:38:53.96,00:38:53.96,this. I want to keep Parvati in.
595,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,I want to keep James in. I even want to keep Eliza in.
596,00:38:59.88,00:38:59.88,I want to be here. I swear I'll give you everything
597,00:39:02.08,00:39:02.08,I have. >> PROBST: It's time to get to
598,00:39:07.33,00:39:07.33,the vote. Ozzy has immunity for tonight's
599,00:39:10.21,00:39:10.21,tribal council only because he did not participate in the
600,00:39:13.29,00:39:13.29,challenge. Everybody else is fair game.
601,00:39:16.00,00:39:16.00,"It is time to vote. Amanda, you're up."
602,00:39:33.71,00:39:33.71,">> I don't even know what to say, Erik."
603,00:39:35.38,00:39:35.38,"You're a good guy. >> Ami, you're an awesome,"
604,00:39:50.92,00:39:50.92,awesome woman. I'm sorry it had to come to
605,00:39:53.21,00:39:53.21,this. What can I say?
606,00:39:55.33,00:39:55.33,This game's hell. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
607,00:40:14.96,00:40:14.96,votes. If anybody has the hidden
608,00:40:26.12,00:40:26.12,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time"
609,00:40:28.29,00:40:28.29,"to do so. Okay, once the votes are read,"
610,00:40:33.17,00:40:33.17,the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked
611,00:40:35.04,00:40:35.04,to leave the tribal council area immediately.
612,00:40:37.25,00:40:37.25,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Ami."
613,00:40:49.00,00:40:49.00,"Erik. One vote Ami, one vote Erik."
614,00:40:55.83,00:40:55.83,"Ami. Two votes Ami, one vote Erik."
615,00:41:03.79,00:41:03.79,"Eighth person voted out of Survivor: Fans vs. Favorites,"
616,00:41:06.42,00:41:06.42,Ami. That's three.
617,00:41:08.17,00:41:08.17,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
618,00:41:20.17,00:41:20.17,>> You guys better start winning.
619,00:41:23.17,00:41:23.17,">> PROBST: Ami, the tribe has spoken."
620,00:41:27.29,00:41:27.29,"Time for you to go. >> Good luck, you guys."
621,00:41:42.08,00:41:42.08,">> PROBST: Well, tonight's vote seems to speak to the idea that"
622,00:41:44.83,00:41:44.83,sometimes you've got to listen to your gut and act on it.
623,00:41:48.12,00:41:48.12,"Clearly, that is what you guys did tonight."
624,00:41:50.21,00:41:50.21,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.

635,00:42:26.12,00:42:26.12,>> It is the idol. >> It's not the idol.
636,00:42:28.21,00:42:28.21,>> Why do you say that? >> Because that can't be the
637,00:42:29.79,00:42:29.79,idol. >> Why not?
638,00:42:31.33,00:42:31.33,>> Because it's just a stick. >> It kills me that Ozzy and

640,00:42:42.21,00:42:42.21,them. The one day I finally feel like

644,00:42:52.17,00:42:52.17,head up. I really need to stay strong.
645,00:42:55.04,00:42:55.04,I'm blessed that I got to play this game twice.
