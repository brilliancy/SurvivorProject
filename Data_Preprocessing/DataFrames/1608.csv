31,00:01:48.58,00:01:48.58,"But I am scared to death,because I'm the last fan left,"
32,00:01:53.54,00:01:53.54,and I don't think I see anyleeway with these favorites.
33,00:01:57.17,00:01:57.17,"I feel like I'm the next to go,no matter what happens now in"

36,00:02:22.17,00:02:22.17,Tracy described me as theleader.
37,00:02:24.33,00:02:24.33,I really don't think that I'mthe leader.
38,00:02:27.29,00:02:27.29,I just think that I've got a lotof good opinions and a lot of
39,00:02:31.17,00:02:31.17,"know-how when it comes tosurviving out here, and people"
40,00:02:34.21,00:02:34.21,respect that.Even though I think I'm a

42,00:02:40.17,00:02:40.17,And that's the kind of situationthat I want to avoid.

61,00:05:44.42,00:05:44.42,happening.Yeah.
62,00:05:52.21,00:05:52.21,">> Tracy is sneaky.>> It's not that big of a deal,"
63,00:05:56.08,00:05:56.08,"you know.It didn't happen, and it's not"
64,00:05:57.92,00:05:57.92,"going to happen, so don't worryabout it."
65,00:06:00.58,00:06:00.58,"Okay?>> This morning, Ami ended up"
66,00:06:04.08,00:06:04.08,telling me that she wasapproached by Tracy and asked to
67,00:06:07.00,00:06:07.00,"vote for me, but she said, youknow, that she wasn't going to"
68,00:06:11.21,00:06:11.21,do that and she's on my side.>> You're not in any danger.
69,00:06:13.79,00:06:13.79,"Like, let it go.>> It's just the tribal council"
70,00:06:15.71,00:06:15.71,last night was kind of like...>> I'm not leaving you.
71,00:06:18.08,00:06:18.08,>> But Ami's a little tooadamant about that.
72,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,"And as much as she says she's onmy side, I'm starting to get"
73,00:06:23.25,00:06:23.25,uneasy feelings.>> I was dreaming about pizza
74,00:06:38.96,00:06:38.96,that I just put in an oven.>> Fluffy on top.
75,00:06:43.08,00:06:43.08,>> Yeah.Mm!
76,00:06:45.58,00:06:45.58,I just don't want anotherbite of coconut.

85,00:07:38.25,00:07:38.25,"Get the shish kebab and just,like..."
86,00:07:40.08,00:07:40.08,">> Oh.>> There's nothing on him,"
87,00:07:42.62,00:07:42.62,"though, really.I think I'm going to feel a"
88,00:07:44.50,00:07:44.50,"little bad eating the rat.You know, he's a small guy."
89,00:07:47.12,00:07:47.12,"There's not much meat on there.But you know, out here, we're in"
90,00:07:49.92,00:07:49.92,"the bush, and it's survival ofthe fittest."
91,00:07:52.08,00:07:52.08,"So yeah, I'm going to dig intothe rat and give it a shot."
92,00:07:55.04,00:07:55.04,"We'll stick a skewer throughhim, barbecue him up."
93,00:07:57.58,00:07:57.58,"Nobody has eaten a rat since thefirst season of Survivor, so"
94,00:08:00.38,00:08:00.38,it's kind of cool.I'll be able to bring that
95,00:08:02.42,00:08:02.42,"tradition back.>> Ew, look at his tail."
96,00:08:04.88,00:08:04.88,He's so yuck.>> I sure the tail is delicious.
97,00:08:08.88,00:08:08.88,>> Have you ever had a ratbefore?
98,00:08:10.21,00:08:10.21,>> Never.>> I think Jason's been trying
99,00:08:12.21,00:08:12.21,to impress the favorites eversince the switch up.
100,00:08:14.04,00:08:14.04,"It's not working, though.I think he's a loser."
101,00:08:26.21,00:08:26.21,>> This is a nightmare overhere.
102,00:08:48.50,00:08:48.50,This island sucks.There's nothing but rock.
103,00:08:51.04,00:08:51.04,You don't have enough beacharea.
104,00:08:53.12,00:08:53.12,You can't go anywhere.There's nothing.
105,00:08:55.17,00:08:55.17,It's like pretty much a barrenland.
106,00:08:57.21,00:08:57.21,"You could live on Malakal.Over here, this is where they"
107,00:09:01.12,00:09:01.12,bring the criminals.>> I just want to go back to
108,00:09:03.17,00:09:03.17,Amanda.>> I just want to go back.
109,00:09:07.25,00:09:07.25,>> I want to go back to Amandaand Cirie and Oz.
110,00:09:10.04,00:09:10.04,>> This sucks.The original Malakal alliance
111,00:09:13.29,00:09:13.29,"was supposed to be myself,Amanda, Parvati, Ozzy, and"
112,00:09:16.83,00:09:16.83,"Cirie.But over here, it's just Parvati"
113,00:09:19.08,00:09:19.08,"and I.So, I mean, I'm at my wit's end."
114,00:09:27.12,00:09:27.12,>> Are you nervous?>> Not now.
115,00:09:29.12,00:09:29.12,>> Not now.And if we can make it back to
116,00:09:31.46,00:09:31.46,"the merge, we're fine.>> That would suck."
117,00:09:39.79,00:09:39.79,"At this point, six people areleft in this tribe, so we need a"
118,00:09:42.96,00:09:42.96,very solid four to go into themerge.
119,00:09:45.38,00:09:45.38,So me and James are really goingto have to pull in two more
120,00:09:48.25,00:09:48.25,"people, you know, in order toremain in a strong position in"
121,00:09:51.92,00:09:51.92,this tribe.This is how I came into this
122,00:09:55.21,00:09:55.21,"game, to play in stages.Like, the first stage was,"
123,00:09:58.54,00:09:58.54,"clearly, before the mix-up, whenit was fans versus favorites,"
124,00:10:01.46,00:10:01.46,"and just to get through that,the first couple of votes."
125,00:10:03.75,00:10:03.75,And then we have the mix-up.So we have to play through this
126,00:10:06.88,00:10:06.88,segment to get to the merge.I just feel like I would feel
127,00:10:10.29,00:10:10.29,"safe if it was you and Alexis,me and James locked up at four,"
128,00:10:15.62,00:10:15.62,a block of four.>> Yeah.
129,00:10:17.21,00:10:17.21,I will work with you.>> Okay.
130,00:10:20.17,00:10:20.17,">> I think that James, we canstill win immunity."
131,00:10:22.21,00:10:22.21,">> I think with James, we'refine until the merge."
132,00:10:25.67,00:10:25.67,"And then once we get to themerge, all of the targets are"
133,00:10:29.08,00:10:29.08,"going to be on the big guys.Like, we're going to be able to"
134,00:10:32.17,00:10:32.17,slip under because everyone'sgoing to be so threatened by the
135,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,"big guys trying to get them out.>> Ozzy, James."
136,00:10:37.04,00:10:37.04,>> Ozzy and James are probablygoing to be the first to go.
137,00:10:39.46,00:10:39.46,>> I'm down.>> I wouldn't see anything wrong
138,00:10:42.29,00:10:42.29,"with it being y'all two, me, andAmanda final four."
139,00:10:46.38,00:10:46.38,">> Yeah, how hot would that be?>> You know?"
140,00:10:49.46,00:10:49.46,"I'm not going to win againstOzzy, and I'm not going to win"
141,00:10:51.17,00:10:51.17,against James.There's no way.
142,00:10:53.21,00:10:53.21,"I love them.I love having them around, but I"
143,00:10:55.25,00:10:55.25,don't want to go up against themat the end.
144,00:10:57.50,00:10:57.50,So I might just go ahead andpull in Alexis and Natalie and
145,00:11:00.46,00:11:00.46,take them with me and Amanda tothe four.
146,00:11:03.12,00:11:03.12,"Everyone else, they're dead tome."
147,00:11:21.67,00:11:21.67,">> Oh.>> Oh, my God."

379,00:25:51.04,00:25:51.04,very badly.I've seen so many seasons of
380,00:25:55.17,00:25:55.17,this show.It's killing me right now that
381,00:25:57.21,00:25:57.21,"I'm this close to maybe makingthe next level, making the next"
382,00:26:01.38,00:26:01.38,set of alliances that can leadme to the end of this game.
383,00:26:05.42,00:26:05.42,"I feel like I'm on my last legs,though."
384,00:26:07.38,00:26:07.38,"I mean, all the fans are dead inthis tribe."
385,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,All the favorites have thecontrol.
386,00:26:12.12,00:26:12.12,"But I'm trying to work with whatI have, and I'm pretty desperate"
387,00:26:15.04,00:26:15.04,right now.How well do you guys trust Ami?
388,00:26:24.62,00:26:24.62,>> Huh?>> How well do you guys trust
389,00:26:26.04,00:26:26.04,Ami?>> I don't know.
390,00:26:29.08,00:26:29.08,Why?>> Because she's been trying to
391,00:26:31.12,00:26:31.12,get something together withAirai since probably Joel left.
392,00:26:35.50,00:26:35.50,"And when Chet was here, shewanted to go with us to vote one"
393,00:26:38.42,00:26:38.42,"of you guys.And then when it was just Tracy,"
394,00:26:41.54,00:26:41.54,"me, and her, she tried to swayone of you guys, and that didn't"
395,00:26:46.04,00:26:46.04,"happen, so Tracy left.( laughter )"
396,00:26:50.21,00:26:50.21,She's told me about differentalliances that you guys have
397,00:26:52.38,00:26:52.38,had.She said that she was part of
398,00:26:54.25,00:26:54.25,"Yau-Man's alliance, and she saidshe had nowhere to go, and"
399,00:26:57.62,00:26:57.62,that's why she came to me andChet and Tracy.
400,00:27:02.21,00:27:02.21,"I really don't want to hurt her,because I really like Ami a lot."
401,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,I like Ami a lot.She's such a good person.
402,00:27:07.08,00:27:07.08,But this isn't about peopleanymore.
403,00:27:08.96,00:27:08.96,">> Right, right.>> This is about the game."
404,00:27:10.25,00:27:10.25,>> Uh-huh.>> And I want you guys to know
405,00:27:12.17,00:27:12.17,"that if you decide Ami, I'll bein with that."
406,00:27:22.21,00:27:22.21,>> Wow.You don't know who to trust
407,00:27:24.12,00:27:24.12,here.You have Erik fighting for his
408,00:27:26.50,00:27:26.50,"life, who will say anythingright now, who will sell his"
409,00:27:29.79,00:27:29.79,"soul to the devil to stay.And then you have Ami, who has"
410,00:27:33.12,00:27:33.12,proven time and time again thatshe can't be trusted-- that I
411,00:27:38.25,00:27:38.25,can't trust her.>> I'm trying to save my neck
412,00:27:40.50,00:27:40.50,here.So that's why I do whatever.
413,00:27:54.33,00:27:54.33,"That's all I have.Take it, leave it, pretend it's"
414,00:27:57.96,00:27:57.96,"lies, whatever, but that'severything that I've heard."
415,00:28:01.71,00:28:01.71,">> See, the problem is I don'ttrust Ami, but I don't trust"
416,00:28:06.17,00:28:06.17,Erik either.So my dilemma is who do I trust
417,00:28:10.12,00:28:10.12,"the least?So I was walking down the beach,"
418,00:28:43.04,00:28:43.04,"and I came back to camp, andthere's Erik just spilling the"
419,00:28:46.08,00:28:46.08,"beans, just going out aboutevery single thing that's gone"
420,00:28:49.54,00:28:49.54,down since the swap.I don't feel like I've done
421,00:28:54.12,00:28:54.12,"anything to hurt you, have you?I've stuck by you 100%, and I"
422,00:28:58.04,00:28:58.04,always will.He's trying everything in his
423,00:29:04.33,00:29:04.33,"right mind...>> No, I understand."
424,00:29:06.00,00:29:06.00,I know.And I don't blame him.
425,00:29:08.04,00:29:08.04,">> No, neither do I.>> If I vote either Ami or Erik,"
426,00:29:12.00,00:29:12.00,it's going to be risky eitherway.
427,00:29:16.04,00:29:16.04,"Erik probably still has hisalliance with the fans, and if"
428,00:29:19.58,00:29:19.58,"they could get Eliza, that couldbe a problem."
429,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,But it's the same thing withAmi.
430,00:29:25.79,00:29:25.79,"She could grab Eliza and go withJason, Natalie, and Alexis and"
431,00:29:30.17,00:29:30.17,cause problems.So I don't know.
432,00:29:34.58,00:29:34.58,Just with all the skittishnessand all the...
433,00:29:38.17,00:29:38.17,">> Well, you guys, I was thelast one, period, to even be,"
434,00:29:42.08,00:29:42.08,"like, talked to about being withyou guys."
435,00:29:45.08,00:29:45.08,You guys didn't ever even askme.
436,00:29:46.75,00:29:46.75,">> I know, because we thoughtyou were with Eliza and those"
437,00:29:48.33,00:29:48.33,"guys.>> Yeah, but I was."
438,00:29:49.62,00:29:49.62,>> I know.>> And then after that...
439,00:29:50.96,00:29:50.96,">> So why would we then?>> Well, yeah, but since then,"
440,00:29:56.00,00:29:56.00,"you guys have never cometogether and really said, ""Okay,"
441,00:29:58.21,00:29:58.21,"Ami, we want you to be really apart of this and totally into"
442,00:30:01.29,00:30:01.29,"this; like, we're watching yourback, no matter what."""
443,00:30:05.04,00:30:05.04,I want to stick with you guysthe whole way and feel like I'm
444,00:30:07.08,00:30:07.08,part of you guys.>> Right.
445,00:30:09.88,00:30:09.88,">> But nobody has really said,""Hey, Ami, we want to fight with"
446,00:30:12.71,00:30:12.71,"you."">> Well, we want to fight with"
447,00:30:14.96,00:30:14.96,"you.>> Okay, thanks."
448,00:30:20.62,00:30:20.62,>> We don't know Erik like weknow Ami.
449,00:30:23.08,00:30:23.08,"Like, we know we can't trustAmi, and it's almost better with"
450,00:30:26.08,00:30:26.08,the devil you know rather thanthe devil you don't know.
451,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,"I feel like we should have,like, a group hug or something."
452,00:30:31.12,00:30:31.12,">> Okay, good, thanks.>> Oh."
453,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,"We just had a really good talk.>> That's what I wanted, yeah."
454,00:30:48.21,00:30:48.21,">> That's not what you wanted.>> That's not what I wanted,"
455,00:30:51.21,00:30:51.21,but...>> Right.
456,00:31:00.92,00:31:00.92,And so you...>> Well opening that up to them
457,00:31:02.92,00:31:02.92,to...>> Yeah.
458,00:31:04.25,00:31:04.25,Thank you.Thank you.
459,00:31:08.17,00:31:08.17,">> No problem.Things were looking pretty bad,"
460,00:31:12.62,00:31:12.62,and I still think they'relooking pretty bad.
461,00:31:16.79,00:31:16.79,"I don't want to give up.I don't want to admit defeat,"
462,00:31:19.12,00:31:19.12,but it's so hard to keep going.We'll also have to see what Ozzy
463,00:31:23.29,00:31:23.29,has to say when he comes backfrom Exile.
464,00:31:26.21,00:31:26.21,I definitely want to talk toOzzy about the future.
465,00:31:28.71,00:31:28.71,I definitely want to ask himabout how he feels with his
466,00:31:31.38,00:31:31.38,alliance and how he feels abouttaking me with him.
467,00:31:35.17,00:31:35.17,>> How'd it go?No way!
468,00:31:38.83,00:31:38.83,Are you serious?>> Yeah.
469,00:31:54.62,00:31:54.62,">> Yeah.>> I came back from Exile, and"
470,00:32:01.21,00:32:01.21,"as soon as I jump off the boat,there was Erik looking like a"
471,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,"lost puppy dog.He came right up to me and said,"
472,00:32:07.04,00:32:07.04,"""I know it's a long shot, butI've got to tell you something"
473,00:32:10.25,00:32:10.25,"about Ami."">> Ami was trying to do"
474,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,"something with me, Tracy, andChet."
475,00:32:16.33,00:32:16.33,"And then it was down to Tracyand me, she was trying to sway"
476,00:32:18.38,00:32:18.38,either Cirie or Amanda to dowhatever.
477,00:32:23.92,00:32:23.92,>> So you're being totallyhonest that Ami was...
478,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,">> Yes, yes.>> Did Ami try and get me out?"
479,00:32:28.50,00:32:28.50,>> Yes.>> Okay.
480,00:32:30.54,00:32:30.54,>> I'm going to write down Amitonight.
481,00:32:32.46,00:32:32.46,I just want you to know that.>> All right.
482,00:32:34.29,00:32:34.29,">> And I would like you to helpme, as a fellow competitor, to"
483,00:32:36.88,00:32:36.88,stay in this game.>> Okay.
484,00:32:41.12,00:32:41.12,"The way I play this game, assoon as someone makes a move"
485,00:32:43.29,00:32:43.29,"against me, that's it.I'm going to do whatever I can"
486,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,to get them out as fast as Ican.
487,00:32:48.04,00:32:48.04,"And that's what Ami did.Erik, on the other hand, given"
488,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"the opportunity, I think he willprove trustworthy, and I'm"
489,00:32:56.58,00:32:56.58,willing to take that chance andthat risk.
490,00:33:10.17,00:33:10.17,">> And that makes sense, but...but I still think that Ami..."
491,00:33:15.67,00:33:15.67,>> We can't trust Ami at all.>> No?
492,00:33:18.08,00:33:18.08,>> No.>> Well...
493,00:33:19.58,00:33:19.58,>> You know what I found outfrom Erik?
494,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,Ami was trying to get me out.Ami's a lying little snot.
495,00:33:28.38,00:33:28.38,">> Who can we trust more,though?"
496,00:33:30.33,00:33:30.33,>> Erik.>> I don't think so.
497,00:33:33.08,00:33:33.08,>> You think Ami?>> At least we know what Ami is
498,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,capable of and what she's hereto... how she's here to play.
499,00:33:38.25,00:33:38.25,Erik is more dangerous than heappears.
500,00:33:41.04,00:33:41.04,>> So is Ami.>> I don't know.
501,00:34:08.46,00:34:08.46,">> PROBST: Four times in a row.Cirie, you're clearly the"
502,00:34:12.29,00:34:12.29,inferior tribe at this point.>> It's horrible.
503,00:34:17.38,00:34:17.38,We just can't figure out why wekeep losing.
504,00:34:20.79,00:34:20.79,And it sucks around camp formorale for us.
505,00:34:25.21,00:34:25.21,">> PROBST: Erik, interestingsituation you're in right now,"
506,00:34:28.00,00:34:28.00,because the last three peoplevoted off have been fans.
507,00:34:30.50,00:34:30.50,There's only one fan left.>> I know.
508,00:34:33.83,00:34:33.83,"I understand that the fans havebeen going, one after another,"
509,00:34:37.00,00:34:37.00,and I understand that I could bethe one tonight.
510,00:34:40.00,00:34:40.00,"I mean, I feel hopeless.A week ago, I was happy, and to"
511,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,"have it go this way, it bafflesme."
512,00:34:46.83,00:34:46.83,">> PROBST: Ozzy, looks to melike it's favorites versus fans"
513,00:34:49.71,00:34:49.71,"still, in a lot of ways.>> Yeah, alliances were made to"
514,00:34:53.42,00:34:53.42,"people that you feel the mosttrust, and that's how we came to"
515,00:34:57.12,00:34:57.12,"be a tribe in the beginning, thefavorites."
516,00:35:01.17,00:35:01.17,"But all of a sudden, the gamegets in the way, and the"
517,00:35:04.62,00:35:04.62,favorites that might feelthey're at the bottom of the
518,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,"pecking order start playing thefans, start playing both sides"
519,00:35:11.29,00:35:11.29,"of the spectrum, and that's whenit starts getting a little bit"
520,00:35:14.04,00:35:14.04,funky.And now I'm starting to realize
521,00:35:17.25,00:35:17.25,that certain things are not whatthey seem.
522,00:35:22.46,00:35:22.46,">> PROBST: Ami, you're tearingup."
523,00:35:24.38,00:35:24.38,">> Well, I obviously know Ozzyis talking about me right now."
524,00:35:28.12,00:35:28.12,>> Why would you think that?>> Because I know Erik has been
525,00:35:32.25,00:35:32.25,all day long saying how I'vebeen playing both sides and all
526,00:35:35.21,00:35:35.21,"of that.>> To be honest, the day that"
527,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,"the fans arrived, Ami said, ""Ineed some help."
528,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,"You guys are numbers."">> Yeah, I could have gone with"
529,00:35:44.25,00:35:44.25,those guys the first vote--could have.
530,00:35:46.50,00:35:46.50,It would have been easy.We had the numbers to do it.
531,00:35:48.96,00:35:48.96,And I didn't.It's just now that finally I
532,00:35:52.12,00:35:52.12,"feel like I'm part of the tribe,you're telling me that,"
533,00:35:54.96,00:35:54.96,"""Whatever, I don't trust her, Idon't believe her."""

538,00:36:07.54,00:36:07.54,"like I'm part of the tribe.You guys go off, and you make"

540,00:36:11.83,00:36:11.83,>> When?>> Like when you guys were
541,00:36:13.12,00:36:13.12,"making decisions for the firstfew times with everybody else,"
542,00:36:15.25,00:36:15.25,it didn't include me.You guys made the decisions.
543,00:36:17.88,00:36:17.88,>> I just want to know were yougunning for me with Tracy and
544,00:36:21.62,00:36:21.62,"Erik, or were you not?>> There is no way I would have"

547,00:36:29.88,00:36:29.88,"peaceful camp, and there is noway I would have ever voted for"
548,00:36:33.29,00:36:33.29,"you, ever, Ozzy.The only way I would vote for"
549,00:36:35.96,00:36:35.96,"you is to win the milliondollars, period."
550,00:36:40.33,00:36:40.33,">> PROBST: Cirie, take methrough the dilemma."
551,00:36:42.67,00:36:42.67,It's easy to keep with whatyou've been doing and get rid of
552,00:36:45.04,00:36:45.04,"the next fan, and we've stillgot four favorites together."
553,00:36:47.71,00:36:47.71,Now Ami's in question.How do you make a decision on
554,00:36:50.83,00:36:50.83,which way to go?-- because it'sa huge vote.
555,00:36:53.54,00:36:53.54,>> I think all the favoriteshave a mutual respect for each

557,00:37:01.08,00:37:01.08,You don't want the visitors tocome in and win the game.
558,00:37:05.62,00:37:05.62,( sighing )I think you just have to go with
559,00:37:08.50,00:37:08.50,"your gut feeling, what you'llbelieve and what you're not"
560,00:37:12.04,00:37:12.04,"going to believe.>> PROBST: Amanda, take me"
