31,00:01:50.17,00:01:50.17, LISA IS WAY FAMOUS. I DON'T KNOW HER STRATEGY FOR
32,00:01:53.30,00:01:53.30,NOT REVEALING WHO SHE IS.  Jeff: AT THE FIRST IMMUNITY

53,00:03:05.33,00:03:05.33, WHY?  WE WENT TO TRIBAL TONIGHT.
54,00:03:14.07,00:03:14.07,I KNEW MY HEAD WAS POTENTIALLY ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
55,00:03:18.43,00:03:18.43,I GOT INTO THIS KIND OF TRIBAL CHIEF THING WHERE IT WAS MY WAY
56,00:03:22.03,00:03:22.03,OR THE HIGHWAY. AND IT ALMOST GOT ME VOTED OUT.
57,00:03:25.53,00:03:25.53, LET'S JUST NOT DO THAT AGAIN. HOW ABOUT THAT.
58,00:03:27.80,00:03:27.80," THAT SOUNDS GREAT.  SO, MY STRATEGY GOING FORWARD"
59,00:03:31.40,00:03:31.40,IS TO STEP BACK AND LET THEM RISE AND FALL ON THE DECISIONS
60,00:03:34.97,00:03:34.97,"THAT THEY MAKE. THAT WAY, IF WE CRASH AND BURN,"
61,00:03:38.90,00:03:38.90,THEN THEY CAN BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AS OPPOSED TO ME.
62,00:03:47.80,00:03:47.80, COME OVER HERE.  WHERE ARE YOU?
63,00:03:51.83,00:03:51.83, RIGHT HERE.  IT IS SO FREAKING COLD.
64,00:04:02.77,00:04:02.77,IF I DID NOT CUDDLE I WOULD HAVE FROZE TO DEATH.
65,00:04:05.60,00:04:05.60,THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON BETWEEN US.
66,00:04:06.77,00:04:06.77,"YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S COLD, YOU NEED TO CUDDLE UP TO SOMEONE."
67,00:04:11.50,00:04:11.50," WHEN I FIRST SAW ANGIE, I KEPT HAVING TO REMIND MYSELF,"
68,00:04:16.43,00:04:16.43,DON'T GET BOOTY BLINDED. DOARNT GET BOOTY BLINDED.
69,00:04:19.73,00:04:19.73,"YOU'RE HERE TO PLAY ""SURVIVOR"" TO MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS AND GO"
70,00:04:23.53,00:04:23.53,"HOME. THERE'S NO DENYING, THAT'S A"

73,00:04:36.80,00:04:36.80,"THEY'RE, LIKE, CUDDLING, FULL ON CUDDLING."
74,00:04:40.30,00:04:40.30,"IT'S THE SAME TRAP THAT IS SET EVERY TIME, AND ANGIE LITERALLY,"
75,00:04:45.77,00:04:45.77,"IT'S A BOOBY TRAP, AND MALCOLM IS FALLING FOR IT."
76,00:04:51.83,00:04:51.83,I WAS NOT BORN YESTERDAY. OKAY.
77,00:04:55.23,00:04:55.23,"AS A TRIBE, WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THAT IS GOING ON BECAUSE"
78,00:04:59.23,00:04:59.23,THOSE TWO ARE DANGEROUS TOGETHER.
79,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17,"ONE HAS GOT TO GO, PERIOD.  Captioning brought to you by"
80,00:05:07.43,00:05:07.43," Survivor Productions, CBS,  THE WEATHER IS HORRIBLE."
81,00:05:42.70,00:05:42.70,IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. EVERYTHING IS SOAKING WET.
82,00:05:45.43,00:05:45.43,"AND I WAS, LIKE, NERVOUS ABOUT THE RICE GETTING MOLDY."
83,00:05:48.83,00:05:48.83,"SO I STUCK MY HAND IN JUST TO MAKE SURE, AND I TOOK THE BAG"
84,00:05:52.33,00:05:52.33,"BEFORE TO FIND EYE CLUE AND I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING, AND WHICH"
85,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,TIME I FOUND IT RIGHT AWAY.  IT'S GOOD.
86,00:05:57.43,00:05:57.43, DO YOU WANT TO JUSTRAPHY IT HERE FOR NOW?
87,00:05:59.30,00:05:59.30, LISA WAS LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER SO I WAS HOPING SHE
88,00:06:02.57,00:06:02.57,DIDN'T REALLY SEE MY FACE OR GIVE AWAY ANYTHING.
89,00:06:17.47,00:06:17.47, SOMETIMES I FEEL ABI COULD POTENTIALLY USE ME IN THE
90,00:06:21.60,00:06:21.60,"FUTURE, BUT I FEEL LIKE I CAN USE HER IN THE FUTURE SO IF I"
91,00:06:24.63,00:06:24.63,"GET HER ON MY SIDE, SOLIDIFY HER WITH ME THAT WILL BE THE"
92,00:06:30.30,00:06:30.30,STRONGEST TWO-SOME AT LEAST IN OUR PRIDE.
93,00:06:41.87,00:06:41.87, I KNEW IT. WHAT DID I TELL YOU.
94,00:06:44.27,00:06:44.27,I KNEW IT.  IT'S AT CAMP.
95,00:06:46.40,00:06:46.40,THIS STAYS BETWEEN US?  OF COURSE.
96,00:06:47.33,00:06:47.33," I MEAN, I TRUST PETER AND I TRUST MICHAEL BUT, LIKE, THIS IS"
97,00:06:50.87,00:06:50.87,"FOR US, FOR THE FUTURE.  YEAH, LET'S GET WATER AND"
98,00:06:53.93,00:06:53.93,HIDE THIS. ME AND ABI REALLY CLICKED SINCE
99,00:06:57.23,00:06:57.23,DAY ONE BUT SINCE HE HAVEN'T BEEN TO GO TO TRIBAL COUNCIL OUR
100,00:07:01.77,00:07:01.77,ALLIANCE HASN'T BEEN TEST YET. I SHARED THE CLUE WITH HER AND
101,00:07:04.37,00:07:04.37,THAT SHOULD BE PROOF ENOUGH THEY TRUST HER.
102,00:07:06.40,00:07:06.40," HOPEFULLY NONE OF THEM FOUND IT, FIRST."
103,00:07:08.83,00:07:08.83, UNDER OUR NOSES.  IT IS GREAT THAT R.C. WANTS
104,00:07:11.90,00:07:11.90,TO SHARE THE IDOL WITH ME. I WAS VERY LUCKY TO CATCH HER
105,00:07:15.83,00:07:15.83,"FINDING THE CLUE, SO SHE HAS NO OTHER CHOICE."
106,00:07:19.03,00:07:19.03,BUT A SIDE OF ME TELLS ME TO BE CAREFUL.
107,00:07:27.67,00:07:27.67," NO.  YEAH, THAT'S NEW."
108,00:07:30.60,00:07:30.60," I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST R.C. ALL THE WAY, BECAUSE"
109,00:07:34.17,00:07:34.17,I FEEL THAT SHE'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE TO MIKE.
110,00:07:37.50,00:07:37.50, WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT?
111,00:07:39.23,00:07:39.23, IF YOU WANT TO GET YOUR CLOTHES OUT OF RAIN.
112,00:07:44.77,00:07:44.77," I CATCH THEM WHISPERING A LITTLE TOO MUCH, I CATCH THEM"
113,00:07:49.37,00:07:49.37,SWITCHING CONVERSATIONS WHEN I WALK IN.
114,00:07:52.90,00:07:52.90,"IF SHE SCREWS ME OVER, THAT'S IT."
115,00:07:54.97,00:07:54.97,"SHE'S DEAD TO ME.  YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, MIKE IS"
116,00:08:02.80,00:08:02.80,"LIKE MY FATHER. I LIKE MIKE, BUT THE PLAN IS"
117,00:08:05.03,00:08:05.03,STILL IN EFFECT.  THIS IS A GAME.
118,00:08:07.47,00:08:07.47,YOU.  IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIKE
119,00:08:08.90,00:08:08.90,MIKE OR NOT. YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME.
120,00:08:10.43,00:08:10.43,YOU AND HIM GO OFF TOGETHER AND YOU'RE ALWAYS WHISPERING.
121,00:08:14.07,00:08:14.07," YEAH, BUT I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU AND PETE."
122,00:08:16.93,00:08:16.93, BUT WE DON'T SWITCH CONVERSATIONS WHEN PEOPLE WALK
123,00:08:19.27,00:08:19.27,"UP TO US. YOU AND MIKE DO, AND IT'S"
124,00:08:21.47,00:08:21.47,OBVIOUS.  I DON'T THINK WE DO.
125,00:08:24.23,00:08:24.23,I THOUGHT ABI WAS MY NUMBER TWO. I THOUGHT SHE COULD HANDLE IT
126,00:08:28.23,00:08:28.23,BUT SHE CAN GO OFF LIKE THAT AND THAT REALLY MAKES ME NERVOUS.
127,00:08:31.40,00:08:31.40,SHE THINKS I COULD BE MAKING SUBALLIANCES AND I'M NOT.
128,00:08:35.00,00:08:35.00,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROVE THAT TO HER.
129,00:08:36.70,00:08:36.70,"I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU. I HAVEN'T LIED TO YOU, AND YOU"
130,00:08:39.07,00:08:39.07,HAVE NO REASON TO THINK THAT I WOULD LIE TO YOU.
131,00:08:41.13,00:08:41.13," I AM YOUR FRIEND.  ME, TOO."
132,00:08:43.33,00:08:43.33, BUT IF YOU ( BLEEP ) WITH ME YOU'RE DEAD.
133,00:08:45.73,00:08:45.73,"SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU DONE. JUST LETTING YOU KNOW."
134,00:09:02.47,00:09:02.47," I'M STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS WEATHER, BUT I PLAYED"
135,00:09:06.40,00:09:06.40,"BASEBALL FOR 17 YEARS AND, YOU KNOW, ""SURVIVOR"" IS GOING TO BE"
136,00:09:10.87,00:09:10.87,A LONG SEASON FOR ME. I'M UP TO THE CHALLENGE.
137,00:09:13.07,00:09:13.07,I KNOW HOW TO WAIT PEOPLE OUT. BASEBALL WE PLAYED FOR SIX
138,00:09:16.40,00:09:16.40,MONTHS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT
139,00:09:18.00,00:09:18.00,"IN THE TANK OCTOBER, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE A CHAMPION."
140,00:09:20.90,00:09:20.90, MAYBE WE SHOULD PLAY INSIDE GAMES LIKE ON A RAINY DAY AT
141,00:09:25.13,00:09:25.13,HOME.  WE COULD DRAW SOME SQUARES IN
142,00:09:27.80,00:09:27.80,THE GROUND.  AND ROCKS.
143,00:09:29.07,00:09:29.07, AND A CHECKERBOARD. YOU GUYS WANT TO DO THAT?
144,00:09:32.30,00:09:32.30, THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING WITH MY KNEE SITTING AROUND WATCHING
145,00:09:35.40,00:09:35.40,THE RAIN FALL COULD BE GOOD FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
146,00:09:37.37,00:09:37.37,I'M MAKING SURE I TAKE CARE OF MY KNEE AND HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY
147,00:09:41.33,00:09:41.33,SO OUR TEAM CAN WIN.  HOW MANY SQUARES ACROSS?
148,00:09:43.50,00:09:43.50, 17.  WHAT ARE YOU DRAWING?
149,00:09:45.10,00:09:45.10, WE'RE MAKING A CHECKERBOARD.  AWESOME.
150,00:09:49.87,00:09:49.87, BETTER HURRY UP BEFORE THE RAIN WASHES THE GAME AWAY.
151,00:09:54.83,00:09:54.83,"THE DOWNSIDE IN THE CONSTANT RAIN, THE IDOL IS SOMEWHERE"
152,00:09:58.20,00:09:58.20,RIGHT IN OUR CAMP AND I CAN'T GET THEM OUT OF THE SHELTER.
153,00:10:00.97,00:10:00.97,I NEED 10 MINUTES JUST SO I CAN DIG AROUND AND GET THIS DAMN
154,00:10:05.57,00:10:05.57,"IDOL. IT'S THERE, IT'S WAITING FOR ME."
155,00:10:07.40,00:10:07.40,"I CAN'T GET TO IT!  JONATHAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK"
156,00:10:13.43,00:10:13.43,ABOUT THIS?  THIS RAIN?
157,00:10:18.80,00:10:18.80,"NO, NO, I'M OKAY.  THE CAVE?"
158,00:10:22.07,00:10:22.07,I CAN GRAB A LITTLE TINDER AND GO THERE.
159,00:10:24.70,00:10:24.70, I'M GO WITH YOU.  I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO GO FOR
160,00:10:27.23,00:10:27.23,"A DIP. I'M SOAKED ANYWAY, I DON'T CARE."
161,00:10:30.27,00:10:30.27, WE'RE GOING TO THE CAVE. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A FIRE.
162,00:10:33.03,00:10:33.03,BE CAREFUL! HAVE FUN!
163,00:10:35.47,00:10:35.47,"YOU, TOO, SWEETHEART.  BYE."
164,00:10:38.43,00:10:38.43,"LUCKILY, THEY'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE RAIN, THEY'VE ALL GONE"
165,00:10:41.63,00:10:41.63,TO A CAVE. THE CAMP IS EMPTY.
166,00:10:47.00,00:10:47.00,THE CLUE SAID IT WAS RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.
167,00:10:49.63,00:10:49.63,"IT'S RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.  WASTE, OUR TIME, GUYS, UNLESS"
168,00:10:57.80,00:10:57.80,"YOU GOT ANYTHING UP THERE, CARTER."
169,00:11:00.13,00:11:00.13, WHERE THE HELL IS THE DAMN IDOL?
170,00:11:05.90,00:11:05.90,"COME ON, MAN.  WELL, FLINT WILL WORK"
171,00:11:10.80,00:11:10.80,REGARDLESS HOW WET IT IS.  I'LL GO WITH YOU.
172,00:11:13.23,00:11:13.23, I NEVER HAD THE IMMUNITY IDOL.
173,00:11:16.17,00:11:16.17,I'VE NEVER HAD INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY AT ALL.
174,00:11:18.10,00:11:18.10,THIS IS A KEY TO THE GAME. I'VE GOT TO FIND THIS THING
175,00:11:20.50,00:11:20.50,BEFORE THEY GET BACK TO CAMP. AND I'M SAYING JUST STAY CALM.
176,00:11:23.80,00:11:23.80,WHO KNOWS HOW LONG YOU HAVE  WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
177,00:11:30.57,00:11:30.57," MY LENS WASHED OUT. I WAS LOOKING FOR MY GLASSES, I"

179,00:11:36.37,00:11:36.37," YEAH, IT WAS SO WET I LOOKED UP AND MY LENS WASHED RIGHT OUT."
180,00:11:42.07,00:11:42.07,DAWSON COMES INTO THE CAMP SO I MADE UP THIS INSANE STORY I LOST
181,00:11:45.80,00:11:45.80,MY GLASSES AND HAD TO GO UNDER TO GET THEM BECAUSE THE RAIN
182,00:11:48.97,00:11:48.97,"WASHED MY CONTACT LENS OUT, WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS."

204,00:13:40.63,00:13:40.63,SIDE. NOW THE CUDDLING HAPPENING

219,00:14:28.13,00:14:28.13, THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME OF THAT.
220,00:14:31.93,00:14:31.93,"I'M HEARING, LIKE, MOANS AND CUD KENNEDY LING AND ALL THAT STUFF."
221,00:14:35.43,00:14:35.43,I'M SORRY. THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING.
222,00:14:37.83,00:14:37.83,"IF WE DON'T WIN IMMUNITY, SHE'S GOT TO GO HOME."
223,00:14:43.27,00:14:43.27," THEY SAY MALCOLM AND ANGIE AS THIS BIG COUPLE, SOME THREAT,"
224,00:14:47.10,00:14:47.10,"HEY, WE NEED TO SPLIT THAT UP. BUT MALCOLM AND I ARE IN AN"
225,00:14:51.40,00:14:51.40,ALLIANCE. I THINK PART OF IT IS A
226,00:14:53.50,00:14:53.50,24-YEAR-OLD GUY SNUGGLING UP TO SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY NICE TO
227,00:14:55.70,00:14:55.70,SNUGGLE UP TO BUT NOW THERE ARE THESE HUGE TARGETS ON THEIR
228,00:15:02.30,00:15:02.30,"BACK.  THIS MORNING, THERE WAS A"
229,00:15:09.27,00:15:09.27,VERY STRANGE VIBE GOING AROUND CAMP.
230,00:15:11.57,00:15:11.57,"I'M NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT NOW I'M NERVOUS THE REST OF"
231,00:15:15.03,00:15:15.03,THE TRIBE IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT ME AND ANGIE COUPLING UP.
232,00:15:19.07,00:15:19.07,"THEY COULD SEE THAT AS A THREAT POTENTIALLY, AND IF THAT'S THE"
233,00:15:22.20,00:15:22.20,"CASE, WE COULD BE IN TROUBLE.  I JUST SIT HERE AND WAIT AND"
234,00:15:45.17,00:15:45.17,WAIT. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD?
235,00:15:46.80,00:15:46.80, HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICH.  I LOVE FRENCH FRIES.
236,00:15:51.07,00:15:51.07,I CAN EAT FRENCH FRIES ALL DAY LONG.
237,00:15:53.30,00:15:53.30," I'M AN INTROVERT BY NATURE, SO I DON'T DO WELL WITH"
238,00:15:57.93,00:15:57.93,CHIT-CHAT. I'M JUST NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT.
239,00:16:00.10,00:16:00.10,"I'M VERY, VERY SHY, SO IF I'M ON THE STAGE, I CAN BE BEHIND A"
240,00:16:05.73,00:16:05.73,"ROLE. BUT IN REAL LIFE, MY TENDENCY IS"
241,00:16:09.30,00:16:09.30,JUST TO WITHDRAW AND NOT LET ANYBODY IN.
242,00:16:13.67,00:16:13.67, SHE'S GONE.  SHE JUST DISAPPEARS WAY TOO
243,00:16:16.87,00:16:16.87,MUCH.  SHE'S OFF LOOKING FOR THE
244,00:16:18.90,00:16:18.90,IMMUNITY IDOL.  I FEEL LIKE SINCE WE'RE SO
245,00:16:20.90,00:16:20.90,"GOOD ON OUR FIVE THEN, YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAVE TO WATCH HER."
246,00:16:23.80,00:16:23.80,"THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR, NOT THE IDOL."
247,00:16:26.13,00:16:26.13, THAT'S WHY SHE'S LOOKING FOR THE IDOL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE SHE
248,00:16:28.97,00:16:28.97,KNOWS.  I THINK THAT LISA IS A LITTLE
249,00:16:30.80,00:16:30.80,"BIT SNEAKY. SHE'S JUST, LIKE, AN OUTSIDER."
250,00:16:34.10,00:16:34.10,I DON'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S TRYING HARD ENOUGH TO CONNECT WITH THE
251,00:16:38.03,00:16:38.03,"TRIBE. WE CREATED AN ALLIANCE, AND SHE"
252,00:16:40.03,00:16:40.03,WASN'T A PART OF IT. BECAUSE SHE WASN'T CONNECTING
253,00:16:43.63,00:16:43.63,WITH ANYBODY ELSE.  I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'M FITTING
254,00:16:57.33,00:16:57.33,IN. I'M ALREADY ON THE OUTSIDE AND
255,00:16:59.67,00:16:59.67,DON'T REALLY HAVE SOMEBODY THAT I CAN TRUST OR TALK TO.
256,00:17:05.13,00:17:05.13,I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS 12.
257,00:17:08.03,00:17:08.03,"YOU KNOW, WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA TO BE ON THE ""MICKEY"
258,00:17:11.73,00:17:11.73,"MOUSE CLUB"" AND I LEFT MY FAMILY."
259,00:17:14.20,00:17:14.20,SO I'M VERY USED TO JUST TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.
260,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,SO I THINK IN REAL LIFE I'M TRYING TO LEARN TO OPEN UP AND
261,00:17:24.10,00:17:24.10,"TRUST MORE AND DEPEND ON OTHER PEOPLE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE"
262,00:17:26.73,00:17:26.73,"PLACE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THAT.  OBVIOUSLY, SHE DOESN'T HAVE"
263,00:17:31.30,00:17:31.30,"IT.  RIGHT, BECAUSE SHE'S STILL"
264,00:17:32.80,00:17:32.80,LOOKING.  SHE'S LIKE A GOG DOGTHAT
265,00:17:35.27,00:17:35.27,KEEPS ESCAPING THE FENCE IN THE BACKYARD.
266,00:17:37.73,00:17:37.73,EVENTUALLY YOU JUST HAVE TO SHOOT IT.
267,00:17:39.90,00:17:39.90," I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT, RIGHT?"
268,00:17:42.00,00:17:42.00," OKAY, SHE'S COMING BACK.  IT'S HARD BEING ON THE"
269,00:17:48.07,00:17:48.07,"OUTSIDE, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST-- MAYBE I'M NOT JUST NOT ABLE TO"
270,00:17:51.37,00:17:51.37,"PLAY THIS GAME. DOWN, THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT"
271,00:18:14.33,00:18:14.33,"THING RIGHT NOW. NO FIRE, THAT'S-- THAT'S DEADLY."
272,00:18:19.23,00:18:19.23,"THE LAST TIME I PLAYED THIS GAME, I WENT OUT, THE PLACE WAS"
273,00:18:23.80,00:18:23.80,"RAINING. I COME BACK IN, IT'S RAINING"
274,00:18:26.67,00:18:26.67,AGAIN. SO I GUESS WE'RE JUST GOING TO
275,00:18:27.93,00:18:27.93,BE WET AND MISERABLE AND IT'S JUST GOING TO SUCK THE B.S..
276,00:18:31.17,00:18:31.17, ARE YOU NOT COLD?  THAT'S WHY I KEEP RUNNING
277,00:18:34.10,00:18:34.10,"AROUND, TO KEEP FROM GETTING COLD."
278,00:18:36.27,00:18:36.27, I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS WET IN MY LIFE.
279,00:18:39.13,00:18:39.13,THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IT HASN'T STOPPED RAINING FOR
280,00:18:42.17,00:18:42.17,MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR SINCE WE GOT HERE.
281,00:18:45.27,00:18:45.27,RUSSELL'S ON FIRE DUTY AND ME AND DENISE ARE JUST TRYING TO
282,00:18:48.23,00:18:48.23,"KEEP THE SHELTER IN ONE PIECE, AND ROXY IS JUST OUT OF IT IT."
283,00:18:51.30,00:18:51.30,SHE'S NOT WORKING. HER MIND'S NOT IN IT.
284,00:18:54.47,00:18:54.47,AND EVERYONE'S NOTICING IT.  THIS IS CRAZY.
285,00:19:04.40,00:19:04.40, IT'S JUST WATER. WE'RE ALL GOOD.
286,00:19:12.33,00:19:12.33, BEING IN SEMINARY SCHOOL AND BEING SOMEONE OF CHRISTIAN
287,00:19:15.20,00:19:15.20,"FAITH, I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GIVE ME GREAT STRENGTH WITHIN THIS"
288,00:19:18.83,00:19:18.83,GAME. BUT WITH IT BEING SO RAINY AND
289,00:19:21.30,00:19:21.30,"SO FREEZING COLD, I JUST CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I'M NOT IN"
290,00:19:26.20,00:19:26.20,MY COMFORT ZONE AT ALL.  TALK TO ME GIRL.
291,00:19:29.63,00:19:29.63,WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE?  DON'T HOLD IT IN.
292,00:19:33.53,00:19:33.53,"THERE'S A LOT TO IT. BUT TRUST ME, WE LOVE YOU."
293,00:19:37.37,00:19:37.37,YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS FAMILY.
294,00:19:39.03,00:19:39.03,AND WE NEED YOU.  I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD NIGHT'S
295,00:19:42.83,00:19:42.83,"SLEEP SINCE I'VE GOTTEN HERE, AND TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU"
296,00:19:45.93,00:19:45.93,"LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING, NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS."
297,00:19:49.33,00:19:49.33,YOU HAVE NONE OF YOUR FAMILY. YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR CHURCH.
298,00:19:54.07,00:19:54.07,"LIKE, RIGHT NOW, I'M ENCOUNTERING ALL OVER AGAIN, AND"
299,00:20:01.20,00:20:01.20,"IT'S NOT EASY.  OH, LOOK IT, THE SUN."
300,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53, YA!  YOU CAN BELIEVE IT?
301,00:20:05.97,00:20:05.97," FINALLY.  THANK YOU, GOD."
302,00:20:09.63,00:20:09.63,"YOU HEAR EVERY PRAYER, GOD. YOU ARE LOVING."
303,00:20:13.67,00:20:13.67,"YOU ARE JUST. GLORY BE TO YOUR NAME, GOD."
304,00:20:31.87,00:20:31.87, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IF SHE'S SPEAKING IN TONGUES OR SAYING A
305,00:20:36.43,00:20:36.43,PRAYER.  I'M SURPRISED.
306,00:20:37.87,00:20:37.87,I THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE STRENGTH OF
307,00:20:40.10,00:20:40.10,"CHARACTER THAN THIS.  IT MAKES ME REALLY NERVOUS,"
308,00:20:43.13,00:20:43.13,RUSSELL.  I KNOW.
309,00:20:43.83,00:20:43.83," ROXY'S, SHE'S PRAYING FOR SUNSHINE FROM GOD."
310,00:20:47.80,00:20:47.80,"IF IT WORKS FOR HER, FANTASTIC. I'M RESPECTFUL, BUT IT'S JUST"
311,00:20:51.40,00:20:51.40,NOT MY GIG. I DON'T PRAY FOR ANYTHING
312,00:20:53.93,00:20:53.93,"ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO GET ME TO THE END OF THE GAME, IT'S"
313,00:20:56.20,00:20:56.20,"GOING TO BE ME.  REPORTER, LET'S GET READY TO"

441,00:28:29.83,00:28:29.83,"TANDANG, CONGRATULATIONS. COME GET YOUR IMMUNITY AND"
442,00:28:33.67,00:28:33.67,REWARD. NO TRIBAL COUNCIL TONIGHT.

447,00:28:50.13,00:28:50.13,GRAB YOUR STUFF. HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
448,00:28:53.37,00:28:53.37,"RUSSELL, YOU THREW A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE AT THE END."
449,00:28:55.97,00:28:55.97,WHAT IS THE FRUSTRATION?  I'M PISSED OFF.
450,00:28:59.80,00:28:59.80,I'M SICK OF THIS. I CAN'T DO THIS.
451,00:29:02.63,00:29:02.63,I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. EITHER GO HARD OR GO HOME.
452,00:29:07.80,00:29:07.80,FORGET THESE OTHER STUPID TALKING TRIBES.
453,00:29:10.97,00:29:10.97,THEY CAN'T BEAT US. THEY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BEAT
454,00:29:14.37,00:29:14.37,US.  Jeff: AND YET THEY HAVE
455,00:29:16.23,00:29:16.23,TWICE.  THAT'S BECAUSE THESE FOLKS
456,00:29:19.00,00:29:19.00,"HAVEN'T DECIDED THAT THEY ARE UNBEATABLE, THAT THEY CAN DO"
457,00:29:21.33,00:29:21.33,THIS. THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR HEADS OUT
458,00:29:24.20,00:29:24.20,OF THEIR BUTT OR GO HOME.  Jeff: SOMEBODY GOING HOME
459,00:29:28.70,00:29:28.70,TONIGHT. I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT TRIBAL
460,00:29:30.23,00:29:30.23,COUNCIL WHERE SOMEBODY WILL BE VOTED OUT OF YOUR TRIBE.
461,00:29:57.47,00:29:57.47, AT LEAST WE WERE CLOSE.  CLOSE DOESN'T KEEP US OUT OF
462,00:30:01.13,00:30:01.13,TRIBAL.  SO WE GO TO THE CHALLENGE
463,00:30:03.27,00:30:03.27,"TODAY, AND ONCE AGAIN, WE LOST. 20-YEAR-OLD ANGIE, BEAUTY QUEEN,"
464,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,"SHE'S, LIKE, ""I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS."""
465,00:30:13.03,00:30:13.03,"AND THEN HERE'S ROXY SAYING, ""NOT ME."
466,00:30:16.43,00:30:16.43,"I HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH WATER TO DRINK TODAY."""
467,00:30:19.77,00:30:19.77,"AND I JUST LOST IT. GUYS, I'M SORRY."
468,00:30:23.60,00:30:23.60,CURSING DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING.  THE EMOTIONS WERE RUNNING
469,00:30:26.50,00:30:26.50,HIGH.  ROX 18 HAS BEEN EXTREMELY
470,00:30:29.33,00:30:29.33,SUCCESSFUL AT MAKING HERSELF A TARGET FOR GETTING HER HEAD
471,00:30:32.47,00:30:32.47,CHOPPED OFF. BUT I NEED ROXY.
472,00:30:36.27,00:30:36.27,"EVERY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS IN CAMP, IF SHE'S AROUND, I KNOW"
473,00:30:38.67,00:30:38.67,ABOUT IT. SHE WAS THE ONE THAT TOLD ME
474,00:30:40.93,00:30:40.93,"ABOUT MALCOLM AND ANGIE. THOSE TWO HAVE LINKED UP, AND"
475,00:30:45.73,00:30:45.73,"I'M THE ONE WITH THE LARGEST TARGET ON MY BACK, SO IF ROX 18"
476,00:30:49.63,00:30:49.63,"GOES, I'M, LIKE, SCREWED.  IT'S A PUBLIC EMBARRASSMENT"
477,00:30:57.40,00:30:57.40,"IF YOU ASK ME.  RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT."
478,00:30:59.77,00:30:59.77," GIRLFRIEND'S ON THE FLOOR, PASSED OUT."
479,00:31:02.30,00:31:02.30,SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR. SHE WAS ON THE FLOOR.
480,00:31:03.67,00:31:03.67," YOU'RE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR ON THAT, SISTER."
481,00:31:06.13,00:31:06.13, THIS IS WHY COMPANIES DON'T LIKE FLATTERRIZATION.
482,00:31:10.57,00:31:10.57,IT SPOILS A GROUP. BUT THEY DON'T LISTEN TO ME.
483,00:31:14.13,00:31:14.13,MALCOLM AND ANGIE ARE TOO BUSY BEING UP EACH OTHER'S BUTT AND
484,00:31:18.03,00:31:18.03,IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING TO THE
485,00:31:21.10,00:31:21.10,TEAM. SHE PLAYS A CHEAP GAME.
486,00:31:22.97,00:31:22.97,"I CAN RESPECT PEOPLE WHO DO GOOD GAMES, WHERE THEY'RE SCHEMING."
487,00:31:27.23,00:31:27.23,THAT ONE OVER THERE WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY SKILL AT ALL.
488,00:31:30.07,00:31:30.07,JUST SHOW THE BOOBS. SOMEBODY WILL FALL FOR IT.
489,00:31:34.80,00:31:34.80,"IT'S LIKE MISS AMERICA ALL DAY LONG, AND IT'S ANNOYING."
490,00:31:37.83,00:31:37.83,"BOTTOM LINE, ANGIE NEEDS TO GO. NOT JUST BECAUSE SHEETS WEAKEST"
491,00:31:42.37,00:31:42.37,LINK BUT HER RELATIONSHIP WITH MALCOLM IS NOT GOOD.
492,00:31:48.37,00:31:48.37," SHE SHOULD HAVE WENT FIRST.  YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."
493,00:31:51.10,00:31:51.10, WE'RE GONNA BE CALLED OUT.  FOR WHAT?
494,00:31:53.43,00:31:53.43," SLEEPING SITUATION.  WELL, WHAT'S SHE GONNA SAY?"
495,00:31:57.43,00:31:57.43, I DON'T KNOW--  WE NEED TO VOTE ANGIE OUT.
496,00:32:00.13,00:32:00.13, THAT'S WHAT SHE'S SAYING.  SHE IS?
497,00:32:02.03,00:32:02.03," WHAT ELSE WOULD SHE SAY?  I'M SURE, YEAH."
498,00:32:04.37,00:32:04.37, IT'S THE ONLY OPTION.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A DONE DEAL
499,00:32:08.00,00:32:08.00,THAT ROXY'S GOING HOME. THE GIRL IS DOING NOTHING AROUND
500,00:32:11.57,00:32:11.57,"CAMP, AND SHE JUST ISN'T HELPFUL WITH ANYTHING, BUT THE GIRL"
501,00:32:14.83,00:32:14.83,STILL HAS A LITTLE FIGHT IN HER. SHE CHATTED UP RUSSELL AND FOR A
502,00:32:19.73,00:32:19.73,GOOD LONG WHILE. I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE CUDDLING
503,00:32:22.23,00:32:22.23,WITH ANGIE. BUT IT'S COLD AT NIGHT AND I
504,00:32:24.67,00:32:24.67,"SKOOCH OVER AND AN ARM COMES AND MAYBE A LEG, AND THEN I'M, ""ALL"
505,00:32:29.73,00:32:29.73,"RIGHT."" IT'S ONLY FLESH AND BLOOD."
506,00:32:32.33,00:32:32.33,A GOOD-LOOKING BLOND GIRL THROWING THROES HER ARM AND LEG
507,00:32:36.73,00:32:36.73,OVER ME I'M NOT GOING TO PUSH HER AWAY BUT NOW I'M NERVOUS
508,00:32:39.63,00:32:39.63,"THAT MIGHT COME BACK TO BITE ME.  WOW, DID I GET AN EARFUL."
509,00:32:47.37,00:32:47.37, SHE DOES HAVE A LITTLE SURVIVAL INSTINCT.
510,00:32:49.90,00:32:49.90, SHE HAD PLENTY OF INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY.
511,00:32:52.87,00:32:52.87,MY CONCERN IS ANGIE IS TRYING TO COME OFF AS THIS SWEET LITTLE
512,00:33:00.93,00:33:00.93,MISS AMERICA YOU TAW THING. BUT ANGIE ISN'T AS INNOCENT A
513,00:33:08.47,00:33:08.47,PLAYER. WHO'S TO SAY WE DON'T LOSE
514,00:33:10.20,00:33:10.20,ANOTHER DAMN CHALLENGE. HOW DO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO
515,00:33:13.77,00:33:13.77,CUT? SHE CHOPS MY HEAD OFF.
516,00:33:15.07,00:33:15.07,"THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IF ROXAN GOES, I'M NEXT."
517,00:33:21.90,00:33:21.90," AT THIS POINT, ROXY AND RUSSELL ARE DEFINITELY ALIGNED,"
518,00:33:24.67,00:33:24.67,AND I KNOW MALCOLM AND ANGIE ARE ALIGNED.
519,00:33:27.53,00:33:27.53,AND I'M CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS.
520,00:33:29.10,00:33:29.10,"I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING JUST ABOUT"
521,00:33:32.57,00:33:32.57,"ROXY THAT I JUST DON'T TRUST. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, EVEN"
522,00:33:36.27,00:33:36.27,"THOUGH I'VE GOT MY ALLIANCE WITH MALCOLM, I MEAN, IF SOMEBODY'S"
523,00:33:40.03,00:33:40.03,"SNUGGLING AND I'M THE ODD ONE OUT, I'M ON THE BOTTOM."
524,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,"I MEAN, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE BOTTOM."
525,00:33:45.07,00:33:45.07,MAYBE I GIVE MALCOLM TOO MUCH CREDIT IN THE SENSE OF PLEASE BE
526,00:33:48.03,00:33:48.03,A STRATEGIC PLAYER. PLEASE DON'T BE BLINDED BY THE
527,00:33:51.73,00:33:51.73,HEADLIGHTS. PLEASE.
528,00:33:52.27,00:33:52.27,"THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S PROS AND CONS TO KEEPING BOTH BUT I'VE"
529,00:33:56.93,00:33:56.93,GOT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR ME SO AGAIN I FEEL PRETTY SURE ABOUT
530,00:34:00.07,00:34:00.07,WHAT MY VOTE'S GOING TO BE BUT IT'S A LONG WAY TO TRIBAL
531,00:34:02.50,00:34:02.50,"COUNCIL, AND I'LL HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT."
532,00:34:27.97,00:34:27.97," Jeff: SO, RUSSELL, A LOT OF EMOTION AT THE END OF THE"
533,00:34:31.70,00:34:31.70,"CHALLENGE TODAY.  JEFF, I'M INTENSE ABOUT THIS."
534,00:34:35.23,00:34:35.23,THIS MEANS A LOT. I DON'T COME HERE TO JUST
535,00:34:38.23,00:34:38.23,DILLYDALLY AND BE CUTE AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.
536,00:34:40.07,00:34:40.07,"I COME HERE TO KICK BUTT.  Jeff: DENISE, IT WAS NOT"
537,00:34:43.37,00:34:43.37,ONLY BOISTEROUS. IT WAS A LITTLE ACCUSATORY.
538,00:34:46.50,00:34:46.50,"""THIS TRIBE NEEDS TO GET IT TOGETHER."""
539,00:34:48.27,00:34:48.27, IT FELT REALLY ACCUSATORY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I GET IT.
540,00:34:51.07,00:34:51.07,I DO. WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR TAIL OFFS
541,00:34:53.47,00:34:53.47,AROUND CAMP. WE WANTED TO BE PREPARED TO GO
542,00:34:55.10,00:34:55.10,"IN AND IT SUCKS.  Jeff: ROXY, FINISH THIS"

581,00:37:02.83,00:37:02.83, Jeff: AS IN ROMANCE.  PROBABLY.
582,00:37:08.53,00:37:08.53, WHAT'S UP?  Jeff: I DIDN'T EVEN SAY
583,00:37:11.20,00:37:11.20,"ANYTHING, MALCOLM.  DID YOU THAT LOOK."
584,00:37:12.73,00:37:12.73,I ALREADY GOT IT FIGURED OUT.  Jeff: SO IS THERE A LITTLE

591,00:37:34.57,00:37:34.57,WORD FOR IT. IT DOES STAND OUT A LITTLE BIT.
592,00:37:37.73,00:37:37.73,IT'S NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL. SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE SISTER TO
593,00:37:40.67,00:37:40.67,ME.  REALLY.
594,00:37:41.33,00:37:41.33, CREEPY.  Jeff: WHAT WAS THAT ROXY.
595,00:37:42.93,00:37:42.93, CREEPY. IF I HAD A BROTHER I WOULDN'T BE
596,00:37:45.67,00:37:45.67,"CUDDLING WITH THEM. I MEAN, LOOK AT ANGIE."
597,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL. IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT THAT'S
598,00:37:51.30,00:37:51.30,THE PERSON YOU FEEL LIKE IS YOUR LITTLE SISTER.
599,00:37:54.33,00:37:54.33,OKAY.  Jeff: WHY DOES IT BOTH
600,00:37:57.20,00:37:57.20,BOTHER YOU.  IT BOTHERED ME ON DAY ONE.
601,00:37:59.40,00:37:59.40,TO ME IT WAS LIKE A BOOBY TRAP-- SORRY-- LITERALLY.
602,00:38:05.43,00:38:05.43,"WHAT, WHAT.  I'M SORRY THAT I'M COLD."
603,00:38:07.43,00:38:07.43,"I'M FREEZING.  YEAH, YOU WERE FREEZING?"
604,00:38:08.90,00:38:08.90," I WOULD CUDDLE WITH YOU, BUT--"
605,00:38:11.27,00:38:11.27," NO, NO, I'M GOOD.  BUT DON'T."
606,00:38:13.10,00:38:13.10," YEAH.  Jeff: RUSSELL, TWO PEOPLE,"
607,00:38:17.57,00:38:17.57,EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF BEING TOGETHER IN A GROUP OF FIVE SOON
608,00:38:21.13,00:38:21.13,"TO BE FOUR, THAT'S HALF THE TRIBE."
609,00:38:22.87,00:38:22.87," OH, ABSOLUTE. YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY,"
610,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,"RELATIONSHIPS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE TIGHTEST ALLIANCE YOU COULD"

612,00:38:35.37,00:38:35.37,UNDERSTAND THAT?  I DO.
613,00:38:36.27,00:38:36.27, Jeff: THE MERE MENTION OF BEING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE IS
614,00:38:39.07,00:38:39.07,ENOUGH TO GET YOU VOTED OUT OF THIS GAME.
615,00:38:41.20,00:38:41.20, UH-HUH.  Jeff: AND ROXY JUST THREW
616,00:38:43.53,00:38:43.53,THAT CLOUD OF SUSPICION OVER THE BOTH OF YOU.
617,00:38:46.43,00:38:46.43," YOU KNOW, THAT'S HER OPINION. AND SHE CAN HAVE THAT."
618,00:38:49.37,00:38:49.37," Jeff: LET'S GET REAL HONEST HERE, ANGIE."
619,00:38:52.37,00:38:52.37,LET'S WAKE UP. HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
620,00:38:55.60,00:38:55.60,"THERE'S SUSPICION. MALCOLM, YOU'RE UNDER THE SAME"
621,00:38:58.70,00:38:58.70,BUS. WHAT IF YOU TWO ARE LINKED?
622,00:39:00.83,00:39:00.83," YEAH, IT'S ALL OUT THERE BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M TIGHT WHAT A GROUP"
623,00:39:05.57,00:39:05.57,OF PEOPLE AND HOPEFULLY THEY UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY'LL TAKE
624,00:39:07.50,00:39:07.50,IT FOR WHAT IT IS NOT FOR WHAT SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO TWIST IT
625,00:39:10.83,00:39:10.83,"TO BE.  YOU KNOW WHAT, JEFF?"
626,00:39:12.40,00:39:12.40,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS A PAIR IN THIS GAME IS VERY DANGEROUS.
627,00:39:16.47,00:39:16.47,SO IF THERE'S EVEN A 60% CHANCE THAT THERE'S MORE THERE BETWEEN
628,00:39:21.70,00:39:21.70,"ANGIE AND MALCOLM, THEN GOOD LUCK TO THE REST OF YOU IF YOU"
629,00:39:24.67,00:39:24.67,"CHOOSE HER OVER ME.  Jeff: WITH THAT, IT IS TIME"
630,00:39:29.83,00:39:29.83,"TO VOTE. MALCOLM, YOU'RE UP."
631,00:39:43.67,00:39:43.67, I HAVE TO CALL A SPADE A SPADE.
632,00:39:45.70,00:39:45.70,"IF YOU WANT TO PRETEND LIKE IT'S SOMETHING ELSE, GO AHEAD."
633,00:39:48.57,00:39:48.57,GOD BLESS YOU AND SHHOM.  I CAN'T STAND YOU.
634,00:39:58.40,00:39:58.40,AND I WON'T MISS YOU.  Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE
635,00:40:16.07,00:40:16.07,VOTES. IF ANYBODY HAS THE HIDDEN

639,00:40:38.87,00:40:38.87,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
640,00:40:41.00,00:40:41.00,"I'LL READ THE VOTES. FIRST VOTE, ROXY."

663,00:42:29.40,00:42:29.40,IMPACT THE GAME OF DENISE AND RUSSELL.
