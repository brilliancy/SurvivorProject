91,00:03:38.38,00:03:38.38,SO DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

100,00:04:06.29,00:04:06.29,>> HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY.
101,00:04:07.92,00:04:07.92,">> NO, THE WHOLE THING WAS OCCUPIED BY PHIL."

106,00:04:19.88,00:04:19.88,AND AFTER DAVE'S PERFORMED SO WELL
107,00:04:21.96,00:04:21.96,"THE LAST COUPLE OF CHALLENGES, WE LOSE DAVE."
108,00:04:24.46,00:04:24.46,AND WE JUST THREW ALL FOUR OF OURS AT ROB
109,00:04:26.75,00:04:26.75,AND WOMP-WOMP.
110,00:04:34.50,00:04:34.50,>> AND I JUST HAVEN'T REALLY FIGURED PHILLIP OUT.

113,00:04:43.08,00:04:43.08,BUT THE REST OF OMETEPE ARE STICKING TO HIM LIKE GLUE.
114,00:04:47.21,00:04:47.21,BOSTON ROB'S GOT THEM ALL VERY TIGHT.
115,00:04:52.08,00:04:52.08,"I'M NOT SURE IF PHILLIP IS EVEN A GOOD GUY AT HEART,"
116,00:04:55.21,00:04:55.21,BUT HE'S DOING HIS THING. HE'S OUT HERE SURVIVING.
117,00:04:57.75,00:04:57.75,I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO HIM.
118,00:05:02.21,00:05:02.21,THE ONLY HOPE WE CAN HANG OUR HAT ON
119,00:05:05.71,00:05:05.71,IS HOW IRRITATED THEY COULD BE WITH PHILLIP.
120,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67,THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE.
121,00:05:41.00,00:05:41.00,">> WHEN I GOT INTO BUDDHISM,"
122,00:05:42.54,00:05:42.54,ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU LEARN IS YOUR SPIRIT

124,00:05:49.08,00:05:49.08,"INCLUDING THE TATHAGATA, WHICH YOU MIGHT CALL GOD"
125,00:05:54.12,00:05:54.12,OR ALLAH OR BUDDHA.
126,00:05:57.08,00:05:57.08,IT WILL MANIFEST ITSELF IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS.
127,00:06:00.25,00:06:00.25,YOU CAN HEAR IT.
128,00:06:01.38,00:06:01.38,YOU CAN FEEL IT.
129,00:06:02.62,00:06:02.62,AND YOU JUST HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ACCEPT IT
130,00:06:04.12,00:06:04.12,FOR WHAT IT IS AND CHANNEL THAT.
131,00:06:08.21,00:06:08.21,I DID A MEDITATION THIS MORNING.
132,00:06:10.17,00:06:10.17,I WAS FOCUSING ON MY ANCESTORS.
133,00:06:12.96,00:06:12.96,"YOU KNOW, I HAD A PREMONITION"
134,00:06:14.67,00:06:14.67,THROUGH MY GRANDFATHER AND I
135,00:06:18.17,00:06:18.17,TOOK THAT AS AN INDICATION THAT
136,00:06:22.08,00:06:22.08,AS MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ROB.
137,00:06:23.79,00:06:23.79,I THINK IT HAS FINALLY COME TO
138,00:06:25.92,00:06:25.92,WHAT I CALL THE FULL CIRCLE OF TRUST.
139,00:06:28.17,00:06:28.17,AND I'M GOING TO PLAY MY ROLE.
140,00:06:30.00,00:06:30.00,THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M NOT PURSUING THE MILLION DOLLARS
141,00:06:32.08,00:06:32.08,BECAUSE I'LL BE HERE AT THE END OF THE GAME.
142,00:06:43.25,00:06:43.25,>> IT'S READY.
143,00:06:44.50,00:06:44.50,DO YOU WANT TO EAT IT?
144,00:06:46.12,00:06:46.12,>> YEAH.

153,00:07:02.29,00:07:02.29,THE HUNGER HAS BEEN TOUGH BUT WE'RE HAPPY NOW.
154,00:07:05.42,00:07:05.42,WE'RE HAPPY IN THE FOOD FIELD.
155,00:07:07.67,00:07:07.67,>> YOU GOOD?
156,00:07:08.67,00:07:08.67,">> YEAH, I'M GOOD."

160,00:07:15.38,00:07:15.38,>> THE RICE SITUATION IS PRETTY UGLY.

605,00:26:20.79,00:26:20.79,>> ROBBIE.
606,00:26:23.83,00:26:23.83,">> Jeff: ROB, COME ON OVER."

608,00:26:27.17,00:26:27.17,NICE WORK.
609,00:26:28.50,00:26:28.50,FINISHED FIRST IN EACH ROUND.
610,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,IMMUNITY IS YOURS.
611,00:26:32.71,00:26:32.71,ROB IS SAFE AT TONIGHT'S TRIBAL COUNCIL.
612,00:26:35.08,00:26:35.08,( APPLAUSE )
613,00:26:36.12,00:26:36.12,>> YA!
614,00:26:37.58,00:26:37.58,>> Jeff: GUARANTEED AT LEAST ONE MORE DAY IN THIS GAME.
615,00:26:40.12,00:26:40.12,"EVERYBODY ELSE, AFTER 27 DAYS,"
616,00:26:43.58,00:26:43.58,ONE OF YOU WILL BE VOTED OUT
617,00:26:45.08,00:26:45.08,AND SENT TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
618,00:26:46.92,00:26:46.92,YOU HAVE THE AFTERNOON TO FIGURE OUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE.
619,00:26:48.88,00:26:48.88,I WILL SEE YOU AT TRIBAL.
620,00:26:52.04,00:26:52.04,>> THE CHALLENGE WAS A CLOSE ONE FOR ME.
621,00:26:54.42,00:26:54.42,BUT I DROPPED THE BALL.
622,00:26:56.38,00:26:56.38,THERE'S THREE OF US RIGHT NOW LEFT IN ZAPATERA.
623,00:26:59.29,00:26:59.29,OUR TARGET IS PHIL.
624,00:27:00.92,00:27:00.92,IF TWO OF THEM WOULD CHANGE
625,00:27:02.83,00:27:02.83,"THEIR MIND AND VOTE FOR PHIL, BAM."
626,00:27:05.17,00:27:05.17,IT'S THE ONLY SHOT WE GOT.
627,00:27:27.33,00:27:27.33,>> I DON'T KNOW.
628,00:27:33.46,00:27:33.46,">> DAMN, THAT'S GOOD."
629,00:27:35.17,00:27:35.17,>> I HAVE NEVER EATEN SO MUCH RICE IN MY LIFE.
630,00:27:41.58,00:27:41.58,TONIGHT'S GOING TO BE AN EASY VOTE.
631,00:27:43.38,00:27:43.38,THERE ARE JUST THREE OF US.
632,00:27:45.29,00:27:45.29,"OLD ZAPATERA, AND THERE ARE SIX OF THEM."
633,00:27:47.12,00:27:47.12,SO THE THREE OLD ZAPATERA ARE VOTING FOR PHILLIP.
634,00:27:50.08,00:27:50.08,"REALLY, WE ONLY NEED TWO MORE VOTES,"
635,00:27:52.08,00:27:52.08,OR ONE OF US OLD ZAPATERA ARE LEAVING.
636,00:27:55.00,00:27:55.00,THE OMETEPE TRIBE HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS NOW
637,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,"WHERE THEY CAN GET RID OF SOMEBODY, SO TONIGHT"
638,00:28:00.50,00:28:00.50,WOULD BE A GREAT NIGHT TO GET RID OF PHILLIP.
639,00:28:08.92,00:28:08.92,PHILLIP'S RIGHT-- IT'S WAR.
640,00:28:13.67,00:28:13.67,PHILLIP IS GOING TO HAVE TO HANG OUT
641,00:28:15.62,00:28:15.62,IN HIS CUTE LITTLE UNDERWEAR FROM NOW ON.
642,00:28:25.50,00:28:25.50,I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER FIND THOSE.
643,00:28:47.38,00:28:47.38,>> MY SWIM TRUNKS WERE ON THE LINE.
644,00:28:49.08,00:28:49.08,DID ANY OF YOU GIRLS MOVE THEM?
645,00:28:50.46,00:28:50.46,>> NO.
646,00:28:51.67,00:28:51.67,>> DID ANY OF YOU GUYS MOVE MY SWIM TRUNKS?
647,00:28:53.21,00:28:53.21,>> I DIDN'T SEE THEM.
648,00:28:55.08,00:28:55.08,">> OKAY, THEY MUST HAVE GOT LEGS"
649,00:28:57.25,00:28:57.25,AND WALKED AWAY ALL ON THEIR OWN.
650,00:29:00.54,00:29:00.54,THAT'S OKAY.
651,00:29:01.83,00:29:01.83,IT'S ALL RIGHT.
652,00:29:03.25,00:29:03.25,IT CAN GET REAL FUN AND EXCITING AROUND HERE.
653,00:29:06.12,00:29:06.12,>> EVERYBODY IN CAMP IS OVER PHILLIP.
654,00:29:10.54,00:29:10.54,>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS I KNOW MY TRUNKS WERE TAKEN.
655,00:29:13.54,00:29:13.54,"AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW, I CAN PLAY THAT GAME."
656,00:29:15.88,00:29:15.88,I CAN PLAY THAT GAME.
657,00:29:17.75,00:29:17.75,>> PHILLIP SAYS ALL THE TIME
658,00:29:19.25,00:29:19.25,"THAT, YOU KNOW, HE WAS A SPECIAL AGENT"
659,00:29:21.79,00:29:21.79,AND HE KNOWS HOW TO READ PEOPLE.
660,00:29:24.46,00:29:24.46,">> YOU'RE FROM THE BIG HOUSE, RIGHT?"
661,00:29:26.79,00:29:26.79,YOU FROM THE BIG HOUSE?
662,00:29:29.50,00:29:29.50,>> CRAZY PHILLIP WHO WEARS FEATHERS
663,00:29:31.92,00:29:31.92,AND PINK UNDERWEAR.
664,00:29:33.75,00:29:33.75,"HONESTLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET RID OF PHILLIP."
665,00:29:36.12,00:29:36.12,>> I HOPE MY SHORTS COME UP TONIGHT
666,00:29:37.50,00:29:37.50,"BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T COME UP TONIGHT,"
667,00:29:38.92,00:29:38.92,IT'S GOING TO GET REAL INTERESTING AROUND HERE.
668,00:29:41.25,00:29:41.25,>> I'M FEELING THREATENED.
669,00:29:42.88,00:29:42.88,>> I'M FEELING THREATENED TOO.
670,00:29:44.54,00:29:44.54,>> YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL THREATENED BY ME.
671,00:29:46.25,00:29:46.25,BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY THREATEN PEOPLE.
672,00:29:48.33,00:29:48.33,I JUST GO OFF LIKE THAT. I JUST GO OFF LIKE THAT.
673,00:29:51.46,00:29:51.46,>> THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.
674,00:29:52.79,00:29:52.79,>> IT SHOULD BE.
675,00:29:54.29,00:29:54.29,YOU KEEP TELLING ME I'M CRAZY. YOU KEEP TELLING ME I'M CRAZY.
676,00:30:01.79,00:30:01.79,>> THIS AIN'T THE NFL.
677,00:30:02.92,00:30:02.92,"IN THE NFL, THEY GOT RULES."
678,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,THEY GOT REFEREES.
679,00:30:16.75,00:30:16.75,>> CHECK HIM OUT.
680,00:30:27.33,00:30:27.33,">> PHIL MADE A TOTAL ASS OUT OF HIMSELF,"
681,00:30:30.25,00:30:30.25,"GETTING RACIAL ABOUT RICE AND CRAZY STUFF,"
682,00:30:34.12,00:30:34.12,"AND I WOULD REALLY THINK WITH ANY KIND OF DIGNITY,"
683,00:30:38.17,00:30:38.17,HE'D APOLOGIZE FOR YOUR ASININE BEHAVIOR
684,00:30:41.79,00:30:41.79,BUT HE HASN'T SAID A WORD.
685,00:30:44.92,00:30:44.92,"THE OMETEPE TRIBE DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM, EITHER."
686,00:30:47.88,00:30:47.88,MAYBE SOMEBODY MIGHT SWAY THE VOTE AND VOTE OUR WAY.
687,00:30:54.21,00:30:54.21,">> TONIGHT, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO WE TARGET, REALLY."
688,00:30:57.04,00:30:57.04,"YOU GOT RALPH, YOU GOT STEVE, AND JULIE."
689,00:31:01.04,00:31:01.04,"BUT, I DON'T KNOW."
690,00:31:03.29,00:31:03.29,"I LOVE PHILLIP, BUT, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS HEAD IS."
691,00:31:08.46,00:31:08.46,"THERE IS ROOM TO PLAY, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE."
692,00:31:14.62,00:31:14.62,"ONE MAN SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS MUCH POWER ON AN ISLAND,"
693,00:31:17.38,00:31:17.38,BUT I'M GRATEFUL THAT I DO.
694,00:31:32.00,00:31:32.00,>> Jeff: WE'LL NOW BRING IN
695,00:31:33.25,00:31:33.25,"THE FIRST MEMBER OF OUR JURY, DAVID."
696,00:31:43.17,00:31:43.17,"PHILLIP, BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE WEARING,"
697,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,I'M GUESSING YOU HAD ANOTHER MEDITATION.
698,00:31:47.79,00:31:47.79,>> I ACTUALLY HAD A FORMER ZAP.
699,00:31:51.04,00:31:51.04,THINK IT WAS CUTE AND STEAL MY CLOTHES.
700,00:31:54.29,00:31:54.29,THOUGHT IT WAS REAL FUNNY.
701,00:31:55.96,00:31:55.96,>> Jeff: DID YOU LOOK AT STEVE?
702,00:31:57.46,00:31:57.46,">> YEAH, I LOOKED AT STEVE BECAUSE I COULD TELL"
703,00:32:00.25,00:32:00.25,THAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO REMOVED MY CLOTHES.
704,00:32:02.46,00:32:02.46,>> Jeff: AND YOU COULD TELL--
705,00:32:03.75,00:32:03.75,THIS GOES BACK TO YOUR FORMER TRAINING?
706,00:32:05.25,00:32:05.25,>> ABSOLUTELY. I CONFRONTED STEVE
707,00:32:07.33,00:32:07.33,ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE DELIBERATELY
708,00:32:09.29,00:32:09.29,CONSUMING ALL THE RICE.
709,00:32:10.92,00:32:10.92,SO IT'S BEEN WAR BETWEEN THE TWO TRIBES.
710,00:32:14.08,00:32:14.08,">> Jeff: SO, STEVE, PHILLIP IS ASSERTING"
711,00:32:16.21,00:32:16.21,THAT THE THE FORMER ZAPATERA ARE EATING
712,00:32:17.67,00:32:17.67,"A LOT MORE RICE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, TRUE?"
713,00:32:20.71,00:32:20.71,>> WELL AS THE MOUTHS STARTED
714,00:32:22.12,00:32:22.12,"DISAPPEARING FROM THE ZAPATERA TRIBE,"
715,00:32:24.00,00:32:24.00,WE DIDN'T HAVE TO RATION AS MUCH
716,00:32:25.79,00:32:25.79,SO WE'RE EATING OUR FOOD THE WAY WE CHOOSE TO.
717,00:32:29.04,00:32:29.04,">> Jeff: ANDREA, THE ZAPATERA TRIBE IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT"
718,00:32:32.25,00:32:32.25,THAT IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS HOW MUCH RICE WE EAT.
719,00:32:34.92,00:32:34.92,>> IT IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE WILL LOOK OUT AND
720,00:32:37.58,00:32:37.58,THEY WILL HAVE THIS BOWL FULL OF RICE FOR THREE OF THEM.
721,00:32:40.62,00:32:40.62,IT JUST SUCKS BECAUSE WE HAVE MAGGOTS
722,00:32:42.29,00:32:42.29,IN THE BOTTOM OF OUR CONTAINER.
723,00:32:44.12,00:32:44.12,>> PHILLIP WAS BRINGING THIS INTO A WHOLE RACIAL
724,00:32:46.58,00:32:46.58,BLACK AND WHITE THING ABOUT THE RICE.
725,00:32:48.62,00:32:48.62,>> Jeff: WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
726,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,>> I WAS RELAXED AND YOU WENT INTO A RACIAL TIRADE
727,00:32:52.29,00:32:52.29,"AND BRINGING THE ""N"" WORD UP ABOUT YOURSELF."
728,00:32:55.25,00:32:55.25,>> Jeff: WHOA.
729,00:32:57.83,00:32:57.83,WHAT HAPPENED?
730,00:32:59.29,00:32:59.29,">> JEFF, IT GOT UGLY."
731,00:33:00.25,00:33:00.25,HE STARTED THREATENING STEVE.
732,00:33:01.62,00:33:01.62,>> Jeff: HOW SO?
733,00:33:02.83,00:33:02.83,>> HE STARTED THREATENING ME
734,00:33:03.83,00:33:03.83,WITH TAE KWON DO OR JUJITSU OR SOMETHING.
735,00:33:05.96,00:33:05.96,"HE GOES, ""WHEN I SNAP, I SNAP."""
736,00:33:08.12,00:33:08.12,>> SO HE GOES YOU'RE CRAZY
737,00:33:10.21,00:33:10.21,"AND THEN THE ""N"" WORD CAME OUT."
738,00:33:11.92,00:33:11.92,">> Jeff: WHO BROUGHT UP THE ""N"" WORD?"
739,00:33:13.50,00:33:13.50,">> PHILLIP BROUGHT UP THE ""N"" WORD."
740,00:33:15.17,00:33:15.17,>> I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT HERE.
741,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,STEVE LIKES TO CALL ME CRAZY
742,00:33:19.54,00:33:19.54,"WHENEVER I BRING A RATIONAL ARGUMENT,"
743,00:33:21.75,00:33:21.75,"THIS RICE IS SPOILING,"
744,00:33:23.21,00:33:23.21,WE CAN PUT IT ALL IN THE SAME CAN.
745,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,WE CAN'T DO IT. WHY NOT?
746,00:33:26.46,00:33:26.46,"YOU'RE CRAZY, YOU'RE CRAZY,"
747,00:33:28.25,00:33:28.25,YOU'RE CRAZY.
748,00:33:29.21,00:33:29.21,HE RESORTS TO CALLING ME CRAZY
749,00:33:30.96,00:33:30.96,"BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO SAY THE ""N"" WORD."
750,00:33:32.50,00:33:32.50,"HE SAYS CRAZY, CRAZY, CRAZY."
751,00:33:34.58,00:33:34.58,">> Jeff: PHILLIP, YOU'RE SAYING WHEN STEVE CALLS YOU CRAZY"
752,00:33:37.58,00:33:37.58,"HE'S SAYING THE ""N"" WORD."
753,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,">> YOU KNOW, RICHARD PRYOR MADE"
754,00:33:40.96,00:33:40.96,A MOST FAMOUS COMEDY ALBUM OF ALL TIME.
755,00:33:42.67,00:33:42.67,"YOU KNOW WHAT THE NAME OF IT IS? ""THAT 'N' IS CRAZY."""
756,00:33:45.38,00:33:45.38,BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WHEN WE CONFRONT
757,00:33:47.96,00:33:47.96,"CERTAIN TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS, THAT'S ONE WAY"
758,00:33:50.54,00:33:50.54,THAT THEY TRY TO REPRESENT THAT.
759,00:33:52.25,00:33:52.25,">> Jeff: PHILLIP, I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT"
760,00:33:54.21,00:33:54.21,"WHERE YOU'RE MAKING THAT LEAP, THE CRAZY EQUALS THE ""N"" WORD"
761,00:33:57.29,00:33:57.29,BECAUSE IT'S VERY TRICKY WHEN YOU HAVE
762,00:33:59.83,00:33:59.83,A WHITE GUY AND A BLACK GUY
763,00:34:01.29,00:34:01.29,"TALKING ABOUT RACE AND THE ""N"" WORD"
764,00:34:02.75,00:34:02.75,BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH AN UGLY HISTORY TO IT.
765,00:34:05.29,00:34:05.29,">> YOU KNOW, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A WOMAN?"
766,00:34:08.83,00:34:08.83,>> Jeff: I DON'T.
767,00:34:10.08,00:34:10.08,">> RIGHT, YOU DON'T."
768,00:34:11.50,00:34:11.50,YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN.
769,00:34:13.25,00:34:13.25,">> Jeff: OKAY, PHILLIP--"
770,00:34:14.25,00:34:14.25,>> LET ME FINISH.
771,00:34:15.25,00:34:15.25,YOU ASKED ME A QUESTION.
772,00:34:16.29,00:34:16.29,I'M GOING TO GO THERE.
773,00:34:17.33,00:34:17.33,WHEN I WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT
774,00:34:18.75,00:34:18.75,AS A FEDERAL AGENT IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT WORKED IN
775,00:34:20.67,00:34:20.67,I WAS THE ONLY ONE OF 67.
776,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33,"I CAN'T SUM IT UP FOR YOU IN WORDS,"
777,00:34:24.50,00:34:24.50,BUT I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.
778,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,JUST LIKE A WOMAN KNOWS IT WHEN
779,00:34:27.83,00:34:27.83,A GUY MAKES AN INAPPROPRIATE REMARK.
780,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,SHE CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS BUT SHE KNOWS SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
781,00:34:32.17,00:34:32.17,"AND I'VE SEEN IT MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE,"
782,00:34:33.96,00:34:33.96,AND THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.
783,00:34:36.25,00:34:36.25,>> Jeff: LET ME USE YOUR SAME LOGIC ON YOU.
784,00:34:39.00,00:34:39.00,YOU'RE SAYING I'M NOT BLACK SO I DON'T KNOW.
785,00:34:41.38,00:34:41.38,"HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS ""CRAZY?"""
786,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT.
787,00:34:45.58,00:34:45.58,THERE'S A JUMP IN LOGIC THAT I NEED THE GAP FILLED.
788,00:34:48.12,00:34:48.12,>> WHEN MY FATHER AND I MOVED TO UPSTATE NEW YORK
789,00:34:51.79,00:34:51.79,HE AND I WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE TOGETHER
790,00:34:54.54,00:34:54.54,"AND THE MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER SAID TO ME FATHER,"
791,00:34:57.12,00:34:57.12,"""WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, BOY?"""
792,00:34:58.46,00:34:58.46,"""YOU TALKING TO ME?"""
793,00:35:00.21,00:35:00.21,"""YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU."
794,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,"WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, BOY?"""

796,00:35:04.12,00:35:04.12,BUT HE TOOK MY FATHER DOWN TO A VERY LOW LEVEL.

798,00:35:11.21,00:35:11.21,>> YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT WHEN I'M FINISHED.
799,00:35:13.83,00:35:13.83,">> I PLAYED 13 YEARS IN THE NFL,"
800,00:35:15.54,00:35:15.54,THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WITH THE LOS ANGELES RAIDERS
801,00:35:18.12,00:35:18.12,WHERE ONE FIFTH OF THE TEAM WAS WHITE.
802,00:35:20.29,00:35:20.29,THERE IS NO LINE OF BLACK AND WHITE IN MY HEART.
803,00:35:25.12,00:35:25.12,>> Jeff: I'M STARTING TO GET SOME CLARITY.
804,00:35:27.42,00:35:27.42,"IF STEVE SAID, ""I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S A CRAZY ARGUMENT."
805,00:35:30.08,00:35:30.08,"IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME."""
806,00:35:32.29,00:35:32.29,"YOU WOULD SAY, ""THAT'S A GUY"

808,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17,"BUT WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS, ""YOU'RE CRAZY"""
809,00:35:37.46,00:35:37.46,IT'S ALMOST BRINGING UP EVERY UGLY ASSOCIATION
810,00:35:41.71,00:35:41.71,YOU CAN THINK OF IN ONE WORD.
811,00:35:44.67,00:35:44.67,SO TELL ME IF THIS IS RIGHT SO FAR.
812,00:35:47.17,00:35:47.17,THERE'S BEEN A BIG DEBATE
813,00:35:49.00,00:35:49.00,BREWING ABOUT LIVING TOGETHER.
814,00:35:50.54,00:35:50.54,"IT CULMINATED WITH THE RICE,"
815,00:35:52.29,00:35:52.29,AND YOU THREW AN IDEA OUT THAT YOU FELT WAS REASONABLE.

818,00:35:58.21,00:35:58.21,"AND THEN AS THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THE RICE CONTINUED,"
819,00:36:01.12,00:36:01.12,"STEVE MADE A COMMENT THAT SAID,"
820,00:36:02.46,00:36:02.46,"""I DON'T LIKE IT. YOU'RE CRAZY."""
821,00:36:04.29,00:36:04.29,AT THAT POINT YOU EQUATED THAT
822,00:36:06.00,00:36:06.00,"WITH YOU'RE CALLING ME THE ""N"" WORD"
823,00:36:07.58,00:36:07.58,AND NOW WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW WORLD WE'RE DEALING WITH.
824,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,>> ABSOLUTELY.
825,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,">> Jeff: OKAY, NOW I'M CAUGHT UP."

828,00:36:16.83,00:36:16.83,YOU TOOK IT ONE WAY.
829,00:36:18.12,00:36:18.12,NOBODY CAN QUESTION THE WAY YOU TOOK IT
830,00:36:20.29,00:36:20.29,AND IT'S BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCES
831,00:36:22.17,00:36:22.17,AND THOSE OF PEOPLE BEFORE YOU.
832,00:36:23.96,00:36:23.96,"NOBODY KNOWS STEVE'S INTENTIONS,"
833,00:36:26.12,00:36:26.12,"OTHER THAN STEVE RIGHT NOW,"
834,00:36:27.79,00:36:27.79,BECAUSE NOBODY HERE REALLY KNOWS STEVE.
835,00:36:29.25,00:36:29.25,WE DON'T HAVE ANY BACKGROUND ON STEVE.
836,00:36:30.67,00:36:30.67,IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE BOTH OF YOU ARE TELLING THE TRUTH.
837,00:36:33.29,00:36:33.29,"THAT THAT FELT VERY MUCH LIKE THE ""N"" WORD"
838,00:36:35.71,00:36:35.71,AND HE ABSOLUTELY DIDN'T MEAN IT THAT WAY.
839,00:36:37.92,00:36:37.92,IS THAT A FAIR ASSESSMENT?
840,00:36:38.92,00:36:38.92,>> SURE.
841,00:36:39.92,00:36:39.92,>> YES.

846,00:36:47.46,00:36:47.46,CONTEXT OF A MILLION-DOLLAR PRIZE?
847,00:36:50.62,00:36:50.62,>> NOT EASY.
848,00:36:52.25,00:36:52.25,>> Jeff: YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE SOMEBODY OUT TONIGHT.
849,00:36:53.83,00:36:53.83,IS THIS GOING TO FACTOR IN?

851,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,CONSCIOUS OR SUBCONSCIOUS.
852,00:36:58.71,00:36:58.71,">> I MEAN, PHILLIP IS A GROWN MAN."
853,00:37:00.46,00:37:00.46,HE SAYS AND FEELS WHAT HE WANTS.

859,00:37:12.62,00:37:12.62,NOT FACTORING INTO OUR DECISION.

861,00:37:18.42,00:37:18.42,>> IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO SIT HERE AND JUST LISTEN
862,00:37:21.08,00:37:21.08,BECAUSE I FEEL FOR STEVE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
