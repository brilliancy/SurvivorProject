771,00:34:16.29,00:34:16.29,I'M GOING TO GO THERE.
772,00:34:17.33,00:34:17.33,WHEN I WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT
773,00:34:18.75,00:34:18.75,AS A FEDERAL AGENT IN THEDEPARTMENT THAT WORKED IN
774,00:34:20.67,00:34:20.67,I WAS THE ONLY ONE OF 67.
775,00:34:22.33,00:34:22.33,"I CAN'T SUM IT UPFOR YOU IN WORDS,"
776,00:34:24.50,00:34:24.50,BUT I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.
777,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,JUST LIKE A WOMAN KNOWS IT WHEN
778,00:34:27.83,00:34:27.83,A GUY MAKESAN INAPPROPRIATE REMARK.
779,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,SHE CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS BUTSHE KNOWS SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT

786,00:34:45.58,00:34:45.58,THERE'S A JUMP IN LOGICTHAT I NEED THE GAP FILLED.
787,00:34:48.12,00:34:48.12,>> WHEN MY FATHER AND I MOVED TOUPSTATE NEW YORK
788,00:34:51.79,00:34:51.79,HE AND I WENTTO THE GROCERY STORE TOGETHER
