308,00:13:22.54,00:13:22.54,IT WAS MY TIME TO GO.
309,00:13:28.08,00:13:28.08,>> KRISTA LEFT HER BIBLE TO ME AND I CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW

311,00:13:35.21,00:13:35.21,I CAN NEVER THANK HER ENOUGH.

320,00:13:58.25,00:13:58.25,MY WHOLE IMAGE OF MATT CHANGED.

322,00:14:04.38,00:14:04.38,OBVIOUSLY HE BONDED WITH KRISTA JUST AS WELL.
323,00:14:06.21,00:14:06.21,SO EVEN THOUGH INITIALLY I WANT MATT TO STAY IN AS LONG AS
324,00:14:09.33,00:14:09.33,"POSSIBLE, HE CAN BE A VERY DANGEROUS AS WELL."

326,00:14:40.46,00:14:40.46,>> YEAH. IT'S NOT MY TOOTH.
327,00:14:42.12,00:14:42.12,I CLEANED IT A LITTLE TOO MUCH.
328,00:14:44.29,00:14:44.29,AND I GOT BACTERIA IN IT.
329,00:14:47.50,00:14:47.50,IT WILL GO AWAY.
330,00:14:49.62,00:14:49.62,>> IT HURTS.

333,00:14:58.00,00:14:58.00,"BACTERIA GOT INTO IT, I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE KNOWS THAT."
334,00:15:00.50,00:15:00.50,SHE IS KIND OF A DRAMA QUEEN PRINCESS.

336,00:15:12.29,00:15:12.29,GIRL FOR THIS KIND OF GAME.
337,00:15:14.46,00:15:14.46,SHE CLEANED HER TEETH WITH A PIECE OF DIRTY STICK
338,00:15:16.79,00:15:16.79,AND GOUGED HER GUM.
339,00:15:18.21,00:15:18.21,THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO REALLY GET OUT OF
340,00:15:21.62,00:15:21.62,THE GAME ON YOUR OWN.
341,00:15:23.58,00:15:23.58,"OUT HERE, EVERYTHING IS NASTY,"
342,00:15:25.29,00:15:25.29,AND STICKING STUFF LIKE THAT IN HER MOUTH.
343,00:15:27.62,00:15:27.62,I MEAN WHO IN GOD'S NAME WOULD
344,00:15:29.67,00:15:29.67,WORRY ABOUT YOUR BACK TEETH.
345,00:15:31.38,00:15:31.38,>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
346,00:15:33.12,00:15:33.12,SARITA'S WEARING ON ME.
347,00:15:35.92,00:15:35.92,>> SARITA IS GOING NUTS TOO.

355,00:15:58.58,00:15:58.58,SARITA IS THE WEAKEST PLAYER IN THE TRIBE.
356,00:16:01.38,00:16:01.38,>> IF THERE IS A WAY TO GET STEPHANIE TO BE MORE A PART
357,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17,OF THE GROUP AND ULTIMATELY KEEP HER
358,00:16:08.21,00:16:08.21,I WOULD DO THAT TO SACRIFICE SARITA.

811,00:37:11.17,00:37:11.17,>> Jeff: WHEN YOU SAY YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS QUAKING IN HER
812,00:37:14.04,00:37:14.04,BOOTS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING PHYSICAL --
813,00:37:15.46,00:37:15.46,>> SHE WAS WORRIED SHE WAS GOING
814,00:37:16.83,00:37:16.83,TO HAVE TO GET IN THERE AND PHYSICAL
815,00:37:18.62,00:37:18.62,"AND I WAS JUST LIKE, I DON'T CARE, LET'S DO THIS."
816,00:37:20.79,00:37:20.79,"LET'S GO, YOU KNOW?"
817,00:37:22.83,00:37:22.83,>> BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE THAT SAID OKAY I CAN
818,00:37:25.33,00:37:25.33,DEFINITELY DO IT AND END UP NOT BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH.
819,00:37:29.04,00:37:29.04,>> Jeff: SO THEN YOU ARE SAYING YOU WERE GLAD TO SIT OUT
820,00:37:31.92,00:37:31.92,BECAUSE THEN YOU COULDN'T BE A GOAT?
821,00:37:33.50,00:37:33.50,">> WELL, NO."
822,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.
823,00:37:36.08,00:37:36.08,>> I AM HEARING THE SAME THING YOU ARE HEARING.
824,00:37:38.67,00:37:38.67,THAT SHE WASN'T GOING TO PUT A FIGHT ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE
825,00:37:41.29,00:37:41.29,"CHALLENGE BECAUSE SHE KNEW SHE WAS THE WORST,"
826,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,AS A RESULT OF THAT SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE IN
827,00:37:45.29,00:37:45.29,TROUBLE NOW BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
828,00:37:47.12,00:37:47.12,HAVE ANY PART IN THE CHALLENGE AND THE FAILURE.
829,00:37:48.92,00:37:48.92,>> BUT I AM NOT SAYING I AM NOT GOOD.
830,00:37:50.25,00:37:50.25,I WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE TO BE OUT THERE.
831,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,>> BULL ...
832,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,>> I AM A BIG ACTIVE MEMBER OF THIS TRIBE
833,00:37:57.29,00:37:57.29,AND IT IS HORRIBLE TO WATCH THAT LOSS.
834,00:37:59.38,00:37:59.38,"I MEAN, I WAS REALLY UPSET ABOUT THE CHALLENGE AS WELL, YOU KNOW,"
835,00:38:02.29,00:38:02.29,"IT IS SAD TO LOSE SOMEONE, BOTTOM LINE."
836,00:38:04.54,00:38:04.54,">> Jeff: DO YOU BUY THAT, STEPHANIE?"
837,00:38:06.25,00:38:06.25,>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
838,00:38:08.29,00:38:08.29,I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYONE COMPLAIN AS MUCH AS SHE DOES.
839,00:38:11.29,00:38:11.29,"SO FOR ME, MY IMPRESSION IS, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE."
840,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,>> THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA --
841,00:38:16.54,00:38:16.54,>> I AM NEAR YOU WHEN YOU LIVE --
842,00:38:19.96,00:38:19.96,>> IF THAT'S YOUR OPINION YOU ARE FINE IF YOU THINK THAT
843,00:38:23.17,00:38:23.17,BUT YOU ARE WAY OFF BASE.
844,00:38:25.21,00:38:25.21,>> I DON'T THINK SO.
845,00:38:26.58,00:38:26.58,">> WELL, THAT'S FINE BUT YOU ARE."
846,00:38:28.29,00:38:28.29,>> OKAY.
847,00:38:30.21,00:38:30.21,">> Jeff: STEVE, IS THERE ANY"
848,00:38:32.33,00:38:32.33,"PART OF YOU THAT WONDERS, MAYBE"
849,00:38:35.25,00:38:35.25,STEPHANIE'S SPUNK ALONE IS WORTH
850,00:38:37.42,00:38:37.42,KEEPING HER AROUND?
851,00:38:39.00,00:38:39.00,">> ON THE PRO SIDE FOR STEPHANIE,"
852,00:38:40.50,00:38:40.50,SHE IS A WARRIOR AT HEART.
853,00:38:42.96,00:38:42.96,SHE WORKS HARD AROUND THE CAMPSITE.
854,00:38:45.62,00:38:45.62,"SARITA, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, IS A TRUSTWORTHY CONFIDANT."
855,00:38:51.25,00:38:51.25,I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER DO MORE AROUND THE CAMPSITE
856,00:38:54.08,00:38:54.08,AND SEE HER PICK UP THE CHALLENGE AS WELL.
857,00:38:57.50,00:38:57.50,"YOU KNOW, SHE IS A BIT OF AN UPTOWN GIRL THAT I DON'T THINK"
858,00:39:00.88,00:39:00.88,HAS GOTTEN HER FOOTING OUT HERE IN THE WILDERNESS YET.
859,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,>> Jeff: SOUNDS LIKE TWO OF THE POSITIVES ARE ACTUALLY
860,00:39:06.00,00:39:06.00,NEGATIVES THERE BUT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN JUST MY PERCEPTION.
861,00:39:08.38,00:39:08.38,"TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, JEFF,"
862,00:39:10.29,00:39:10.29,THE TRIBE IS TOO OBSESSED WITH TRUSTING ONE ANOTHER AT A TIME
863,00:39:13.08,00:39:13.08,WHEN TRUST IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE.
864,00:39:15.08,00:39:15.08,THE STAGE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW FOCUSES ON PUTTING THE BEST SIX
865,00:39:18.33,00:39:18.33,"OUT IN THE FIELD TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO WIN, TRUST WILL"
866,00:39:21.17,00:39:21.17,"COME WITH TIME, RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WINNING."
867,00:39:23.67,00:39:23.67,>> Jeff: RALPH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT STRATEGIC LAYOUT?
868,00:39:26.83,00:39:26.83,>> SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.
869,00:39:28.75,00:39:28.75,SOUNDS REAL GOOD.
870,00:39:32.17,00:39:32.17,">> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S VOTE IS CLEARLY A BIG VOTE."
871,00:39:35.29,00:39:35.29,WHICH DIRECTION IS THIS TRIBE GOING TO GO?
872,00:39:38.29,00:39:38.29,LET'S FIND OUT.
873,00:39:39.38,00:39:39.38,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
874,00:39:40.62,00:39:40.62,"RALPH, YOU ARE UP."
875,00:39:51.42,00:39:51.42,>> MAYBE IF YOU SPENT MORE TIME THINKING
876,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,"ABOUT YOUR ACTIONS AND HOW YOU FIT IN WITH YOUR TRIBE,"
877,00:39:56.08,00:39:56.08,YOU WOULD STILL BE AROUND.
878,00:40:12.33,00:40:12.33,>> I WILL SEE YOU ON REDEMPTION ISLAND.
879,00:40:14.54,00:40:14.54,I WILL KICK YOUR ASS THEN.
880,00:40:23.79,00:40:23.79,">> I MADE THE BEST ARGUMENTS FOR YOU, STEPHANIE,"
881,00:40:26.25,00:40:26.25,HOPEFULLY THIS WORKS.
882,00:40:32.62,00:40:32.62,>> Jeff: I WILL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
883,00:40:42.25,00:40:42.25,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL,"
884,00:40:44.50,00:40:44.50,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED TO LEAVE THE
885,00:40:46.17,00:40:46.17,TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
886,00:40:47.96,00:40:47.96,I WILL READ THE VOTES.
887,00:40:51.58,00:40:51.58,"FIRST VOTE, SARITA."
888,00:40:57.38,00:40:57.38,"STEPHANIE, ONE VOTE, ONE VOTE SARITA."
889,00:41:02.21,00:41:02.21,">> SARITA, TWO VOTES SARITA."
890,00:41:06.79,00:41:06.79,"STEPHANIE, THAT'S TWO VOTES"
891,00:41:08.75,00:41:08.75,"STEPHANIE, TWO VOTES FOR SARITA."
892,00:41:13.25,00:41:13.25,"STEPHANIE, THREE VOTES"
893,00:41:14.83,00:41:14.83,"STEPHANIE, TWO VOTES SARITA."
894,00:41:19.50,00:41:19.50,SIXTH PERSON VOTED OUT OF
895,00:41:21.21,00:41:21.21,"SURVIVOR REDEMPTION ISLAND, STEPHANIE."
896,00:41:23.12,00:41:23.12,"THAT'S FOUR, THAT IS ENOUGH."
897,00:41:24.50,00:41:24.50,YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
898,00:41:31.75,00:41:31.75,"STEPHANIE, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
899,00:41:37.12,00:41:37.12,BUT YOU WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET BACK IN THIS GAME.
900,00:41:39.62,00:41:39.62,GRAB YOUR TORCH. HEAD TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.
901,00:41:51.29,00:41:51.29,">> Jeff: WELL, YOU MADE THE DECISION TO GO WITH SOMEBODY"
902,00:41:53.54,00:41:53.54,YOU THINK YOU CAN TRUST VERSUS KEEPING SOMEBODY
903,00:41:55.58,00:41:55.58,THAT MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER AT CHALLENGES.
904,00:41:57.79,00:41:57.79,WE WILL KNOW SOON ENOUGH IF YOU MADE THE RIGHT CALL.
905,00:42:00.17,00:42:00.17,GRAB YOUR TORCHES AND HEAD BACK TO CAMP.
906,00:42:01.92,00:42:01.92,GOOD NIGHT.
907,00:42:15.54,00:42:15.54,STAY TUNED FOR SCENES FROM OUR NEXT EPISODE.
908,00:42:22.00,00:42:22.00,NEXT TIME ON SURVIVOR.
909,00:42:24.25,00:42:24.25,>> ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ASPECTS
910,00:42:25.54,00:42:25.54,OF THE GAME OF SURVIVOR IS MENTAL FATIGUE.
911,00:42:27.92,00:42:27.92,>> I AM LOSING MY MIND.
912,00:42:30.12,00:42:30.12,>> DAVE IS BUGGING ME.
913,00:42:32.29,00:42:32.29,HE'S A LOOSE CANNON.
914,00:42:33.71,00:42:33.71,">> CRAZY, CRAZY, CRAZY."
915,00:42:36.38,00:42:36.38,">> ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB, ROB."
916,00:42:38.62,00:42:38.62,">> IF WE LOSE, THE TARGET IS ON ME."
917,00:42:40.54,00:42:40.54,>> WOW.
918,00:42:48.00,00:42:48.00,MY STRATEGY OUT HERE IS TO BE
919,00:42:50.88,00:42:50.88,BRUTALLY HONEST ABOUT ZAPATERA TRIBE.
920,00:42:54.21,00:42:54.21,>> NO WAY.
921,00:42:55.62,00:42:55.62,YOU DON'T WANT TO ALIGN WITH MY PEOPLE.
922,00:42:57.08,00:42:57.08,>> I DON'T THINK I DO.
923,00:42:58.67,00:42:58.67,">> THEY ARE NOT NICE PEOPLE, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT."
924,00:43:01.42,00:43:01.42,">> WHEN I WIN, I AM NOT GOING BACK TO THEM."
925,00:43:04.17,00:43:04.17,THAT IS OBVIOUS.
