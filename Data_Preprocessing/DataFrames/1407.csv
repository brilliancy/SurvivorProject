2,00:00:02.92,00:00:02.92,Survivor... >> PROBST: ...at the ailing Ravu
3,00:00:09.04,00:00:09.04,"tribe, Yau-Man and Earl were the only ones that knew that the"
4,00:00:12.08,00:00:12.08,immunity idol was hidden at camp.
5,00:00:14.21,00:00:14.21,>> Yau and I have an upper hand because we're the only ones that
6,00:00:16.25,00:00:16.25,know that it's even on this island.
7,00:00:18.08,00:00:18.08,It's time to go hunting for crab.
8,00:00:20.04,00:00:20.04,>> PROBST: And they worked together to find it.
9,00:00:21.92,00:00:21.92,>> I'm very excited. I get a chance to dig.
10,00:00:24.46,00:00:24.46,I don't know for how long. >> PROBST: But Yau-Man's search
11,00:00:26.17,00:00:26.17,was in vain. >> Try again.
12,00:00:29.33,00:00:29.33,>> PROBST: Drop your buffs. >> What?
13,00:00:31.21,00:00:31.21,>> PROBST: Then the game took an unexpected turn.
14,00:00:33.21,00:00:33.21,>> Mookie. >> PROBST: Choosing members from
15,00:00:35.08,00:00:35.08,"opposing tribes... >> Come on, Dreamz."
16,00:00:36.92,00:00:36.92,>> PROBST: Maybe the biggest rivalry thus far just paired up.
17,00:00:39.75,00:00:39.75,"...the new tribes were formed. Yau-Man, who are you going to"
18,00:00:42.00,00:00:42.00,take? >> Stacy.
19,00:00:43.58,00:00:43.58,">> PROBST: Lisi, never good to be odd person out."
20,00:00:45.75,00:00:45.75,Lisi was left tribeless. >> I thought this would be like
21,00:00:48.04,00:00:48.04,"""I'm out!"" >> PROBST: So you just told"
22,00:00:50.83,00:00:50.83,these guys that you're fine going home.
23,00:00:52.88,00:00:52.88,>> Now would be a good time to exit.
24,00:00:54.33,00:00:54.33,">> PROBST: Well, for the time being, you'll be going to Exile"
25,00:00:56.21,00:00:56.21,"Island. >> Great, thanks."
26,00:00:58.00,00:00:58.00,>> PROBST: One very big decision left to make.
27,00:01:01.04,00:01:01.04,Which group is going to live on the luxurious Moto beach and
28,00:01:04.79,00:01:04.79,which group of people is going back to Ravu?
29,00:01:07.12,00:01:07.12,The fate of the two tribes was determined...
30,00:01:09.12,00:01:09.12,Show it. ...when Edgardo pulled the
31,00:01:11.25,00:01:11.25,orange buff of Ravu. ( cheering )
32,00:01:14.25,00:01:14.25,">> Garcon, my breakfast! >> PROBST: At the new Moto..."
33,00:01:17.00,00:01:17.00,">> This is real food. >> PROBST: Earl, Michelle, and"
34,00:01:18.88,00:01:18.88,Yau-Man enjoyed the comforts of their new home.
35,00:01:22.38,00:01:22.38,>> My world just got turned upside down and for the better.
36,00:01:25.04,00:01:25.04,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: At Ravu...
37,00:01:27.96,00:01:27.96,>> I'm glad that there are no women here.
38,00:01:29.42,00:01:29.42,>> PROBST: The new tribe of strong men bonded.
39,00:01:31.12,00:01:31.12,">> You want to have Anthony just get the fire going, and we'll go"
40,00:01:33.04,00:01:33.04,fishing? >> PROBST: But Anthony was left
41,00:01:34.29,00:01:34.29,"behind. >> Unfortunately, I'm left back"
42,00:01:36.21,00:01:36.21,"here to tend the fires while the big men go off, and cookie is"
43,00:01:39.33,00:01:39.33,still here at the campfire. >> PROBST: At a tense immunity
44,00:01:42.67,00:01:42.67,"challenge, the physically inferior Moto Tribe surprised"
45,00:01:46.21,00:01:46.21,Ravu when they pushed their way to victory.
46,00:01:49.58,00:01:49.58,Moto wins immunity! With tribal council looming...
47,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,">> Anthony, where's the flint? >> PROBST: ...Anthony and Rocky"
48,00:01:56.17,00:01:56.17,were on the chopping block. >> I see myself really far from
49,00:01:59.17,00:01:59.17,"being friends or liking Rocky a lot, because all he would cause"
50,00:02:02.17,00:02:02.17,is a lot of turmoil. >> PROBST: At tribal council...
51,00:02:05.29,00:02:05.29,>> You have poor social skills. >> I got poor social skills?
52,00:02:08.17,00:02:08.17,>> Yes! >> PROBST: Anthony and Rocky
53,00:02:09.33,00:02:09.33,faced off. >> You act like a little girl
54,00:02:11.21,00:02:11.21,sometimes. >> This is why I don't say
55,00:02:12.58,00:02:12.58,anything. >> Take the skirt off a little
56,00:02:14.00,00:02:14.00,bit. Let's go.
57,00:02:15.33,00:02:15.33,>> PROBST: But Anthony was the one to go.
58,00:02:17.04,00:02:17.04,"Anthony, the tribe has spoken. 12 are left."
59,00:02:22.25,00:02:22.25,"Who will be voted out tonight? >> Five men, I think she'll take"
60,00:02:39.46,00:02:39.46,a step back. I think she just felt threatened
61,00:02:42.17,00:02:42.17,by the other girls on the other tribe.
62,00:02:47.62,00:02:47.62,>> She was. Lisi will be joining our tribe
63,00:02:49.38,00:02:49.38,today. The episode she had during the
64,00:02:52.04,00:02:52.04,"last challenge where she was like ""Well, I'm out of here"""
65,00:02:54.62,00:02:54.62,"does concern me a little bit, but Lisi's the kind of person"
66,00:02:57.12,00:02:57.12,just says what's on her mind at that moment.
67,00:02:59.29,00:02:59.29,So I'm hoping a couple days on Exile Island will help her
68,00:03:02.21,00:03:02.21,recant a little bit. >> Hey!
69,00:03:16.21,00:03:16.21,">> Welcome home, baby! >> I'm with the boys!"
70,00:03:19.08,00:03:19.08,">> How was Exile? >> Exile, can I just tell you,"
71,00:03:21.96,00:03:21.96,it's not as bad as people think. When I first got to Exile
72,00:03:26.21,00:03:26.21,"Island, I cracked up. I literally broke down."
73,00:03:28.96,00:03:28.96,"But that's a great thing, because when you break down, you"
74,00:03:31.71,00:03:31.71,put your pieces back together again.
75,00:03:33.25,00:03:33.25,It makes you stronger. >> We thought you was going to
76,00:03:35.04,00:03:35.04,quit on us. >> Whoo!
77,00:03:37.12,00:03:37.12,"Well, I mean, imagine, we're together for what, 14 days?"
78,00:03:41.21,00:03:41.21,And all of a sudden it's like... I had a breakdown.
79,00:03:44.25,00:03:44.25,"I was like, ""I'm out of here."" >> That's cool."
80,00:03:46.46,00:03:46.46,>> The dynamics in the tribe are going to get a little sticky
81,00:03:49.83,00:03:49.83,because Edgardo and Alex and I are really tight.
82,00:03:53.21,00:03:53.21,And I know that Rocky and Mookie and even Dreamz might want to
83,00:03:57.12,00:03:57.12,get me out of the way. Let me tell you something.
84,00:03:59.75,00:03:59.75,"I reached, like, this spiritual enlightenment."
85,00:04:01.88,00:04:01.88,"Like, when you sit in one place for a long time, you start"
86,00:04:05.42,00:04:05.42,"thinking, like, deep. So I was, like, tripping, man."
87,00:04:08.38,00:04:08.38,I was up there like... >> I told you she was going to
88,00:04:09.92,00:04:09.92,fit right in. Didn't we tell you guys?
89,00:04:13.04,00:04:13.04,">> Back at old Moto, I never really had a relationship with"
90,00:04:15.17,00:04:15.17,Lisi. I didn't like her.
91,00:04:16.29,00:04:16.29,"She didn't like me. >> Okay, we're officially on"
92,00:04:18.33,00:04:18.33,"Survivor now, guys. >> So she should be worried out"
93,00:04:20.79,00:04:20.79,of her mind. ( theme song playing )
94,00:05:39.92,00:05:39.92,>> I sleep so light. I hear everything.
95,00:05:46.17,00:05:46.17,">> The new Moto tribe consists of three old Ravu, which is"
96,00:05:51.08,00:05:51.08,"myself, Yau, and Michelle, and old Moto, which is Cassandra,"
97,00:05:55.96,00:05:55.96,"Boo, and Stacy. So now this new Moto is three"
98,00:05:59.42,00:05:59.42,"and three, so everybody has three votes."
99,00:06:01.58,00:06:01.58,So we're even. So... but we need to change the
100,00:06:05.00,00:06:05.00,power here. I'm going to catch a fish.
101,00:06:08.50,00:06:08.50,Y'all want to go down in the water a little bit?
102,00:06:10.33,00:06:10.33,>> I just want to get the boat back.
103,00:06:11.92,00:06:11.92,">> Well, if anything, we can just go do that, just go bring"
104,00:06:14.33,00:06:14.33,the boat. >> I'm setting something up with
105,00:06:16.17,00:06:16.17,Yau. There is definitely an idol on
106,00:06:20.04,00:06:20.04,Ravu's camp and Moto's camp. And we have an idea of exactly
107,00:06:24.54,00:06:24.54,"where the immunity idol is here, but we haven't had the chance to"
108,00:06:29.33,00:06:29.33,go get it. >> Yau-Man is going to stay
109,00:06:32.88,00:06:32.88,behind while the five of us go retrieve the boat.
110,00:06:35.54,00:06:35.54,"So this gives him a moment to look, and we'll have it."
111,00:06:38.75,00:06:38.75,So that'll be our ace in the pocket.
112,00:07:19.29,00:07:19.29,>> Right there. Can you see it?
113,00:07:21.12,00:07:21.12,You can see it now. >> Oh!
114,00:07:37.29,00:07:37.29,"Oh, my God! This is my... this is it."
115,00:07:44.12,00:07:44.12,This is my million dollars right here.
116,00:07:51.29,00:07:51.29,"I'm glad I'm not in an untying contest right now, because I"
117,00:07:53.96,00:07:53.96,would lose. The one and only immunity idol.
118,00:08:03.08,00:08:03.08,"I know there's another one somewhere in the other island,"
119,00:08:05.79,00:08:05.79,"but right now, this is the only one that exists."
120,00:08:10.12,00:08:10.12,This is mine. This is mine.
121,00:08:13.17,00:08:13.17,It looks good on me. It really does.
122,00:08:17.25,00:08:17.25,I'm going to jump out of my skin here!
123,00:08:21.29,00:08:21.29,"Turtle. My plan now is to let Earl know,"
124,00:08:31.08,00:08:31.08,because I owe him that much. He engineered this whole boat-
125,00:08:34.38,00:08:34.38,saving party for me. And so I agree to share the use
126,00:08:40.17,00:08:40.17,of this idol when the time comes with him.
127,00:08:52.17,00:08:52.17,"All right, untouched. Back to work!"
128,00:09:07.12,00:09:07.12,">> Yau-Man. >> Yau, we're back."
129,00:09:09.12,00:09:09.12,>> My arms are falling off. Did you guys get the boat?
130,00:09:11.50,00:09:11.50,">> No, it's too high up. We're going to have to wait for"
131,00:09:13.50,00:09:13.50,"high tide. >> Oh, well, good try and all"
132,00:09:15.08,00:09:15.08,"that. Thank you, y'all."
133,00:09:17.29,00:09:17.29,"The sun's not that hot, so I should have gone out and helped."
134,00:09:20.58,00:09:20.58,>> It wasn't anything we can do. The boat is so far up on the
135,00:09:22.29,00:09:22.29,"rock. With a net, where I was at, I'll"
136,00:09:27.62,00:09:27.62,catch something. >> Let's see how we can untangle
137,00:09:30.33,00:09:30.33,the net. When I first came into this
138,00:09:32.33,00:09:32.33,"game, I did not have any expectation of finding a new"
139,00:09:35.96,00:09:35.96,friend in such a short time that I can trust so much.
140,00:09:44.38,00:09:44.38,>> But Earl is different. His word was good.
141,00:09:46.38,00:09:46.38,"I would have never thought that a big, strong, black man would"
142,00:09:50.83,00:09:50.83,become one of my best allies in this game.
143,00:10:01.79,00:10:01.79,>> What I initially told Yau is I will help you with the idol
144,00:10:05.79,00:10:05.79,"because I knew the value of Yau, and I knew if I helped this guy,"
145,00:10:09.08,00:10:09.08,I could feel it that he would actually remember that and would
146,00:10:12.17,00:10:12.17,trust me a lot. >> I went at it so fast.
147,00:10:15.38,00:10:15.38,I was digging furiously. I mean...
148,00:10:18.83,00:10:18.83,>> Yau having the idol helps because hopefully there's a
149,00:10:22.58,00:10:22.58,"power change. We'll share this, you know."
150,00:10:25.33,00:10:25.33,"If they're trying to vote me out, he'll let me know, and"
151,00:10:27.42,00:10:27.42,he'll give it to me. And if they're trying to vote
152,00:10:29.12,00:10:29.12,"him out, then he'll just use it, and so that's the way how two"
153,00:10:32.29,00:10:32.29,people can share an idol. >> We'll make it to the final
154,00:10:34.83,00:10:34.83,"two if all things align, you know, Earl."
155,00:10:40.33,00:10:40.33,">> PROBST: Moto, come on in! Ravu, come on in!"
156,00:10:49.21,00:10:49.21,Moto getting your first look at the new Ravu tribe.
157,00:10:53.08,00:10:53.08,"Anthony voted out at the last tribal council, and this"
158,00:10:56.04,00:10:56.04,"morning, Lisi joined their tribe, returning from Exile"
159,00:10:58.62,00:10:58.62,Island. >> She made it.
160,00:11:00.67,00:11:00.67,Wow. >> PROBST: For today's
161,00:11:03.46,00:11:03.46,"challenge, each tribe will use a flame thrower to launch"
162,00:11:06.71,00:11:06.71,fireballs at three separate targets.
163,00:11:09.67,00:11:09.67,"Each time you hit a target, it will burst into flames."
164,00:11:13.25,00:11:13.25,First tribe to ignite all three of their targets wins reward.
165,00:11:17.75,00:11:17.75,You want to know what you're playing for?
166,00:11:19.42,00:11:19.42,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Tomorrow morning, the"
167,00:11:21.58,00:11:21.58,winning tribe will be picked up by a seaplane and taken to your
168,00:11:25.38,00:11:25.38,own private Fijian arcade. A little usual in the middle of
169,00:11:30.33,00:11:30.33,"all these islands to find an arcade, but we did."
170,00:11:34.12,00:11:34.12,"So you'll have an afternoon of a different kind of game playing,"
171,00:11:37.21,00:11:37.21,"foosball, air hockey, a bowling alley."
172,00:11:39.79,00:11:39.79,And an afternoon at an arcade would not be complete without
173,00:11:43.21,00:11:43.21,hot dogs and beer. >> Yeah!
174,00:11:46.46,00:11:46.46,">> PROBST: In addition, the winning tribe will send one"
175,00:11:49.50,00:11:49.50,person from the losing tribe to Exile Island.
176,00:11:52.29,00:11:52.29,Give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started.
177,00:11:56.79,00:11:56.79,"First two throwers, it is Earl for Moto, Dreamz for Ravu."
178,00:12:01.38,00:12:01.38,">> Come on, Earl! You got this!"
179,00:12:03.12,00:12:03.12,">> You got it, Earl! ( cheering )"
180,00:12:05.54,00:12:05.54,">> Hot dogs, Dreamz. >> PROBST: When you're ready."
181,00:12:18.00,00:12:18.00,"Three, two, one, launch. Earl just short for Moto, inches"
182,00:12:26.12,00:12:26.12,"short. Dreamz not messing around,"
183,00:12:32.79,00:12:32.79,connects and scores for Ravu. Ravu leads one-zip.
184,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,"Next round, it is Michelle for Moto, Lisi for Ravu."
185,00:12:45.17,00:12:45.17,"Three, two, one, launch. Lisi launches hard but short."
186,00:12:50.71,00:12:50.71,"Michelle just misses. >> Oh, good try!"
187,00:12:53.71,00:12:53.71,Good try! >> PROBST: It's Yau-Man for
188,00:12:56.17,00:12:56.17,"Moto, Edgardo for Ravu. >> You got it!"

205,00:14:02.00,00:14:02.00,"Three, two, one, launch. Alex, not going to do it with"
206,00:14:09.12,00:14:09.12,that toss. Cassandra with a good toss for
207,00:14:12.08,00:14:12.08,"Moto, just misses to the right. Next round, Stacy for Moto,"
208,00:14:18.12,00:14:18.12,Rocky for Ravu. Ravu leads 2-1.

210,00:14:27.00,00:14:27.00,Rocky just short for Ravu. Going to have to get some air on

251,00:17:04.12,00:17:04.12,so we can play some games. >> The question of the day is
252,00:17:08.67,00:17:08.67,how much food can you shove in a pie hole?
253,00:17:15.04,00:17:15.04,They're just shoving like four hot dogs in their mouth.
254,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,"I'm like, ""Chill out, boys. Relax."
255,00:17:19.88,00:17:19.88,"You'll give yourself a stomachache."""
256,00:17:21.46,00:17:21.46,">> Oh, man. >> Ow."
257,00:17:23.00,00:17:23.00,"( burping ) >> Just to let you know, on the"
258,00:17:26.29,00:17:26.29,"other side, we have a golf area. >> Oh, wow."
259,00:17:30.12,00:17:30.12,">> Nice. >> Cool, virtual golf."
260,00:17:32.04,00:17:32.04,">> Behind you, you have a pool table."
261,00:17:33.54,00:17:33.54,"In front of you, you have a bowling alley."
262,00:17:35.04,00:17:35.04,>> All right! >> Whoa!
263,00:17:40.46,00:17:40.46,>> Strike! >> It's my favorite kind of
264,00:17:44.79,00:17:44.79,scenario. I love being surround by guys.
265,00:17:48.08,00:17:48.08,"To me, being around a bunch of boys is my favorite place to be,"
266,00:17:50.58,00:17:50.58,"straight up. >> All right, she's on my team."
267,00:17:57.96,00:17:57.96,>> Lisi doesn't hold back. She's like one of the guys.
268,00:18:00.08,00:18:00.08,"She just went straight at the food, the beer."
269,00:18:02.25,00:18:02.25,"I mean, she's the type of girl you'd go to a football game,"
270,00:18:06.17,00:18:06.17,"chug a beer, bump chests, you know, every touchdown."
271,00:18:10.00,00:18:10.00,">> Yeah! Hey, I'm next."
272,00:18:13.17,00:18:13.17,">> Well, when I first got here, obviously, I'm the chick, so I"
273,00:18:16.17,00:18:16.17,would be the weakest link right there.
274,00:18:19.71,00:18:19.71,"( laughter ) But after the win, all the guys"
275,00:18:23.75,00:18:23.75,are feeling good. Whoa!
276,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,So they're more accepting. They've gotten to know me
277,00:18:29.88,00:18:29.88,"better, so they can see how I could really fit in with the"
278,00:18:32.92,00:18:32.92,"guys. All right, killer."
279,00:18:36.58,00:18:36.58,"No, that's a pretty swing. >> Everything about me is"
280,00:18:39.04,00:18:39.04,pretty. >> The whole dynamics of the
281,00:18:42.17,00:18:42.17,"game is just beginning to shift daily, so we'll see what"
282,00:18:44.58,00:18:44.58,"happens, man. >> It's my third time here."
283,00:18:58.04,00:18:58.04,"It's just boring, no big deal. The idol has been found, so"
284,00:19:02.46,00:19:02.46,there's no purpose of getting a clue.
285,00:19:05.92,00:19:05.92,No one's been here as much as myself.
286,00:19:08.50,00:19:08.50,I'm going to officially change the name to Earl Island.
287,00:19:13.25,00:19:13.25,I'll be accepting reservations for tourism.
288,00:19:15.79,00:19:15.79,"You have a nice view of the ocean, plenty of room to lay"
289,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,"down, good eats. Just like the finest"
290,00:19:22.50,00:19:22.50,"restaurants. Yeah, this is my island."
291,00:19:25.75,00:19:25.75,"Lodging isn't very good, but it's a beautiful view."
292,00:19:30.79,00:19:30.79,"Earl's island in Fiji. >> Man, I just ate way too much"
293,00:19:40.88,00:19:40.88,"food. Oh, god!"
294,00:19:46.04,00:19:46.04,>> This is horrible. What have we done?
295,00:19:50.17,00:19:50.17,>> Alex? >> What?
296,00:19:53.04,00:19:53.04,">> Hurry up, man. >> So two franks and another hot"
297,00:19:57.83,00:19:57.83,dog and then a brownie and a little bit of beer to wash it
298,00:20:04.21,00:20:04.21,"all down with. And oddly enough, felt kind of"
299,00:20:07.50,00:20:07.50,"sick. >> Oh, god!"
300,00:20:10.88,00:20:10.88,>> Those brownies were so good today.
301,00:20:12.62,00:20:12.62,">> Oh, shush! >> Can we not talk about it"
302,00:20:14.38,00:20:14.38,"right now? >> Oh, how come... listen, how"
303,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,"come when I'm starving, right, I'm sitting on the grass and the"
304,00:20:19.00,00:20:19.00,"dirt, everyone's talking about chocolate chip ice cream."
305,00:20:21.71,00:20:21.71,"You know, now they're all rolling on the couch."
306,00:20:24.12,00:20:24.12,"""Ah, my stomach."" So I started making fun of them."
307,00:20:27.04,00:20:27.04,"""Oh, I'm going to eat 19 hot dogs, and I'm going to eat 17"
308,00:20:29.12,00:20:29.12,"brownies."" They were running their mouth."
309,00:20:31.71,00:20:31.71,Now I'm full. I feel great now.
310,00:20:33.79,00:20:33.79,"Now yous all got stomachaches, and now I can't talk about"
311,00:20:36.38,00:20:36.38,brownies and stuff that I had earlier today.
312,00:20:38.75,00:20:38.75,That's not fair. People call me up on my own
313,00:20:40.75,00:20:40.75,"stuff all the time. I just think it's fair game, you"
314,00:20:42.96,00:20:42.96,know? And if you can't take stuff like
315,00:20:45.17,00:20:45.17,"that here, you shouldn't be here."
316,00:20:48.08,00:20:48.08,>> This is terrible. >> I told you.
317,00:20:50.75,00:20:50.75,Everyone's hurting. You guys better be ready for the
318,00:20:52.92,00:20:52.92,challenge soon. I don't care.
319,00:20:55.17,00:20:55.17,>> You know what? I'd rather have this feeling
320,00:20:57.21,00:20:57.21,than have the feeling of starving.
321,00:20:59.17,00:20:59.17,">> Okay, well, then suck up the stomachache and shut up then."
322,00:21:01.75,00:21:01.75,">> Rocky, he just doesn't fit in with us."
323,00:21:03.62,00:21:03.62,"We're pretty laid-back guys. We make fun of each other, but"
324,00:21:06.38,00:21:06.38,to a certain extent. But Rocky takes it to another
325,00:21:08.96,00:21:08.96,"level. I think I gained, like, three"
326,00:21:11.17,00:21:11.17,pounds. >> Three pounds of stomachache
327,00:21:13.17,00:21:13.17,is what you gained. >> Because he criticizes
328,00:21:15.00,00:21:15.00,"everybody, and he's too harsh on people, and people don't respect"
329,00:21:17.83,00:21:17.83,that. People don't want a guy to be
330,00:21:19.38,00:21:19.38,"criticizing you all the time. That's why they have, like,"
331,00:21:21.54,00:21:21.54,bosses and teachers back at home.
332,00:21:23.54,00:21:23.54,">> Listen, you've been crying about this for three weeks."
333,00:21:26.12,00:21:26.12,You got what you wanted. You went a little too crazy too
334,00:21:28.33,00:21:28.33,fast. Suck it up.
335,00:21:30.92,00:21:30.92,"( Rocky laughing ) >> We lost the reward challenge,"
336,00:21:45.62,00:21:45.62,and it proved to us that we need to step up our game if we want
337,00:21:50.50,00:21:50.50,to keep this immunity idol. It's very important to each and
338,00:21:53.17,00:21:53.17,"every one of us here. Some of us, it's more important"
339,00:21:55.50,00:21:55.50,"than they really understand. I mean, it's more important to"
340,00:21:59.33,00:21:59.33,"Yau than he knows, because if we lose, he's gone tonight, because"
341,00:22:02.46,00:22:02.46,he's got to be the weakest physically out of all of us.
342,00:22:06.12,00:22:06.12,That's good. >> Now things are definitely
343,00:22:11.29,00:22:11.29,"looking up. I'm in an alliance with Earl,"
344,00:22:14.17,00:22:14.17,who is very strong and a very honorable man.
345,00:22:17.17,00:22:17.17,"I have the immunity idol, and if I can make it through the merge,"
346,00:22:21.25,00:22:21.25,I can go quite far. My first priority is not let
347,00:22:24.25,00:22:24.25,anybody know that I got the immunity idol.
348,00:22:26.62,00:22:26.62,Then I have a really evil thought.
349,00:22:30.58,00:22:30.58,I thought what if there is another immunity idol for them
350,00:22:33.08,00:22:33.08,to find? So I start out making my own
351,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,immunity idol out of a half coconut shell.
352,00:22:39.75,00:22:39.75,"Basically, I took a coconut shell."
353,00:22:42.33,00:22:42.33,"I paint it with a little face, and I painted eyebrows."
354,00:22:46.04,00:22:46.04,"And just in case they don't know it's an immunity idol, I put the"
355,00:22:48.75,00:22:48.75,"initials ""I.I."" on it. There are so many immunity idols"
356,00:23:07.92,00:23:07.92,running around here. I made that.
357,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,I wrapped it back up. And when I see that Michelle and
358,00:23:17.12,00:23:17.12,"Stacy was falling asleep in bed, I went quickly and buried it"
359,00:23:22.79,00:23:22.79,"back in that hole. I didn't bury it very deep, so"
360,00:23:27.00,00:23:27.00,it's easier to find. So I'm hoping that someone will
361,00:23:30.46,00:23:30.46,decide to hunt for the idol and we'll have one too many idols
362,00:23:33.75,00:23:33.75,"running around, except I have the official one."
363,00:23:40.21,00:23:40.21,This upcoming immunity challenge is very important to me.
364,00:23:43.83,00:23:43.83,"I'm always the target, but I do have the immunity idol."
365,00:23:47.00,00:23:47.00,"If we lose this immunity challenge, then I will have to"
366,00:23:50.33,00:23:50.33,really keep my ears to the ground and listen to see if I am
367,00:23:53.58,00:23:53.58,"up. If I am, then I will be forced"
368,00:23:56.67,00:23:56.67,"to use it, but I really hope I do not need to use it."
369,00:24:10.42,00:24:10.42,>> PROBST: How's everybody doing?
370,00:24:11.75,00:24:11.75,">> Good. >> Good, Jeff."
371,00:24:13.08,00:24:13.08,>> PROBST: Let's get to it. We'll now bring in Earl
372,00:24:15.04,00:24:15.04,returning once again from Exile Island.
373,00:24:17.42,00:24:17.42,( applause ) >> Earl!
374,00:24:20.33,00:24:20.33,">> I'm back, feeling good. >> PROBST: First thing's first,"
375,00:24:24.25,00:24:24.25,"take back immunity. Thanks, Michelle."

565,00:33:17.71,00:33:17.71,there's some clues that I could go on which lead me to believe
566,00:33:21.29,00:33:21.29,"that it might be here, but it's all really vague."
567,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,What I'm going to do with the idol is have Edgardo and Alex
568,00:33:26.88,00:33:26.88,help me. >> What do these clue say?
569,00:33:30.67,00:33:30.67,">> It might be right underneath this big cave, underneath where"
570,00:33:34.38,00:33:34.38,people sleep. >> Okay.
571,00:33:37.71,00:33:37.71,>> So it might be... it might be underneath the palm fronds.
572,00:33:41.46,00:33:41.46,"We'll see what happens. You know, I have no choice but"
573,00:33:43.62,00:33:43.62,"to believe Alex at this point. But that being said, this game"
574,00:33:47.46,00:33:47.46,"turns and twists, and people say one thing and do another."
575,00:34:02.25,00:34:02.25,>> For real? That's what they're telling you?
576,00:34:03.88,00:34:03.88,>> Yeah. >> Here's the thing.
577,00:34:09.92,00:34:09.92,Would you guys care if you guys all voted him and then I just
578,00:34:13.25,00:34:13.25,"voted, like, just someone? Because I..."
579,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,">> Yeah, no, I wouldn't care. I'd probably vote with you."
580,00:34:18.29,00:34:18.29,>> Dreamz told me that Alex and Edgardo were talking about
581,00:34:22.12,00:34:22.12,"sending off Rocky before Lisi. Well, that leaves only one of"
582,00:34:25.88,00:34:25.88,"previous Ravu, and they're just going to wipe us out."
583,00:34:29.79,00:34:29.79,"I got have to figure out a way to turn it around, and I think"
584,00:34:32.50,00:34:32.50,"right now my man Dreamz, I trust him."
585,00:34:35.25,00:34:35.25,"I think he was left out in the other previous tribe, and so the"
586,00:34:39.17,00:34:39.17,"opportunity to, you know, align myself with himself is the best"
587,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,"thing I can do. >> Me and Rocky's personality,"
588,00:34:44.33,00:34:44.33,"we don't bump heads like it appeared that it would, because"
589,00:34:46.88,00:34:46.88,I understand Rocky. That's how... that's who he is.
590,00:34:49.08,00:34:49.08,"That's how he talks, you know what I mean?"
591,00:34:50.88,00:34:50.88,"That don't mean that he's mad at you and want to fight you, you"
592,00:34:52.96,00:34:52.96,get what I'm saying? >> Yeah.
593,00:34:54.79,00:34:54.79,>> I think Rocky knows that he's on the chopping block tonight.
594,00:34:57.08,00:34:57.08,"Some of the boys think, ""Hey, he's got a bad attitude; he's"
595,00:34:59.38,00:34:59.38,"got to go."" >> What's everybody crying"
596,00:35:01.42,00:35:01.42,about? >> Losing today.
597,00:35:05.67,00:35:05.67,>> Just got to win tomorrow. >> Rocky throws a lot of false
598,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,"attitude, but it's not real attitude."
599,00:35:09.71,00:35:09.71,It's not the real way he feels. It's just his personality.
600,00:35:12.25,00:35:12.25,>> Right? >> We have to win tomorrow.
601,00:35:14.46,00:35:14.46,>> Yeah. >> I never really got the chance
602,00:35:16.83,00:35:16.83,to know Rocky. I would really like to get to
603,00:35:19.12,00:35:19.12,know Rocky. So I feel I would rather Lisi
604,00:35:23.08,00:35:23.08,"leave if somebody was to leave, because then we'll still be"
605,00:35:25.29,00:35:25.29,"strong, but just without Lisi. >> I hate tribal council."
606,00:35:33.58,00:35:33.58,"What do you think, bitch? >> I think you should ( no"
607,00:35:37.21,00:35:37.21,"audio ) push over a little bit, unless you want to make out with"
608,00:35:38.92,00:35:38.92,"me ( no audio ). To be honest with you, I've been"
609,00:35:44.54,00:35:44.54,"a little nervous today. Out of all the tribal councils,"
610,00:35:47.96,00:35:47.96,I was the one pulling the strings in all the other ones.
611,00:35:50.46,00:35:50.46,That's not the case this time. >> Yeah.
612,00:35:56.25,00:35:56.25,">> I think Lisi's definitely going to go home, but who knows?"
613,00:35:59.54,00:35:59.54,I could go home today. >> Going into tribal is going to
614,00:36:07.33,00:36:07.33,"be like a cliffhanger situation, because even though we've all"
615,00:36:11.17,00:36:11.17,"talked that I'm not going to get voted out, you never know what"
616,00:36:13.17,00:36:13.17,happens at the last minute. >> PROBST: So let's start with
617,00:36:39.08,00:36:39.08,Lisi. When you weren't selected to be
618,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,"on either tribe, you had somewhat of a meltdown."
619,00:36:44.96,00:36:44.96,">> Yeah, sure. I was looking forward to going"
620,00:36:46.46,00:36:46.46,home. I thought that was my exit.
621,00:36:48.21,00:36:48.21,">> PROBST: So when you came back to this tribe, you had to be a"
622,00:36:51.17,00:36:51.17,little uneasy about how you would be welcomed.
623,00:36:54.21,00:36:54.21,">> Um, I knew I was going to go back to a tribe that contained"
624,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"people from my old tribe, so I was really not concerned about"
625,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,"general consensus of the tribe towards me, because I knew I was"
626,00:37:06.08,00:37:06.08,going to find a friend wherever I went.
627,00:37:08.46,00:37:08.46,"And from that thread, I would just, you know, start bringing"
628,00:37:11.50,00:37:11.50,"myself up. >> PROBST: Dreamz, you watched"
629,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,Lisi out there. What was your reaction?
630,00:37:18.04,00:37:18.04,">> Well, at first, when Lisi had the breakdown, I knew that she"
631,00:37:21.08,00:37:21.08,"just wanted to quit the game. And I was like, ""Man, we got to"
632,00:37:23.33,00:37:23.33,"win so we don't have to get Lisi,"" because I didn't want her"
633,00:37:26.04,00:37:26.04,on our team if she was wanting to go home.
634,00:37:28.29,00:37:28.29,But when she came back and she wasn't the same way she was when
635,00:37:31.08,00:37:31.08,"I seen her with the breakdown, I was happy about that, and I knew"
636,00:37:33.67,00:37:33.67,"that we were ready for business. >> PROBST: Rocky, what's the"
637,00:37:36.92,00:37:36.92,feeling as tribal council starts to approach?
638,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,"Is everybody scurrying around, trying to make sure it's not"
639,00:37:42.12,00:37:42.12,them? >> I think it's in the back of
640,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"people's minds, because you know, we just... we're a tight"
641,00:37:47.21,00:37:47.21,"group, but we're a new group, you know what I mean?"
642,00:37:49.54,00:37:49.54,"So I think everyone's a little... not really nervous,"
643,00:37:51.50,00:37:51.50,but it's always in the back of everybody's minds exactly what's
644,00:37:53.38,00:37:53.38,"going on. >> PROBST: So, Mookie, this"
645,00:37:56.17,00:37:56.17,"tribe's strength being its physical strength and agility,"
646,00:37:59.88,00:37:59.88,how does that factor in to who you get rid of?
647,00:38:02.96,00:38:02.96,">> It's hard choosing which person is going to go, because"
648,00:38:04.88,00:38:04.88,we're all so strong. And Lisi over here brings
649,00:38:08.12,00:38:08.12,another aspect. Maybe we need a girl.
650,00:38:10.67,00:38:10.67,So it makes it really difficult trying to figure out who to let
651,00:38:13.79,00:38:13.79,"go, because this whole physical thing hasn't really been working"
652,00:38:17.08,00:38:17.08,in our favor so far. So you have to look at it both
653,00:38:19.33,00:38:19.33,"ways, and I really don't know. >> PROBST: Rocky, can you trust"
654,00:38:23.46,00:38:23.46,these guys to be telling you the truth as we get ready to vote?
655,00:38:28.21,00:38:28.21,">> Basically, you know what? I'm going with my gut right now."
656,00:38:30.08,00:38:30.08,I trust certain people. That's all I can do.
657,00:38:32.75,00:38:32.75,"And then I just got to read everybody else, you know, see"
658,00:38:34.71,00:38:34.71,"what I can do. >> PROBST: Lisi, does this tribe"
659,00:38:38.08,00:38:38.08,need to make any adjustments? You get up tomorrow morning;
660,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,what's the first thing you're going to do?
661,00:38:42.33,00:38:42.33,">> Look around and be like, ""Ooh, God, I'm still here?"""
662,00:38:45.12,00:38:45.12,"( laughing ) Yeah, pretty much."
663,00:38:48.25,00:38:48.25,"We need to win. Whatever happens, we need to"
664,00:38:50.17,00:38:50.17,"win. >> PROBST: Okay, let's get to"
665,00:38:53.08,00:38:53.08,"the vote. If, at this point, somebody has"
666,00:38:56.17,00:38:56.17,"found the hidden immunity idol, and you need to play it tonight,"
667,00:38:58.92,00:38:58.92,you would present it to me before I read the votes.
668,00:39:01.42,00:39:01.42,"It is time to vote. Rocky, you're up."
669,00:39:29.17,00:39:29.17,>> Because that's the way it's got to go.
670,00:39:55.50,00:39:55.50,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
671,00:40:08.58,00:40:08.58,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and they want to
672,00:40:10.33,00:40:10.33,"play it, now is the time to do so."
673,00:40:16.12,00:40:16.12,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
674,00:40:18.25,00:40:18.25,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
675,00:40:20.21,00:40:20.21,"council area immediately. First vote, Lisi."
676,00:40:29.04,00:40:29.04,Lisi. Rocky.
677,00:40:35.33,00:40:35.33,"Two votes Lisi, one vote Rocky. Rocky."
678,00:40:41.96,00:40:41.96,"Two votes Lisi, two votes Rocky. Rocky."
679,00:40:48.42,00:40:48.42,"That's three votes Rocky, two votes Lisi."
680,00:40:51.12,00:40:51.12,One vote left. Seventh person voted out and the
681,00:40:58.08,00:40:58.08,"first member of our jury, Rocky. You need to bring me your torch."
682,00:41:03.38,00:41:03.38,">> Get it, boys, huh? >> PROBST: Rocky, the tribe has"
683,00:41:11.88,00:41:11.88,"spoken. >> Be good, boys, huh?"
684,00:41:27.96,00:41:27.96,">> PROBST: Well, based on what I heard tonight, Rocky had no idea"
685,00:41:30.25,00:41:30.25,"that was coming. If it could happen to him, it"
686,00:41:33.04,00:41:33.04,can happen to you. Grab your torches.
687,00:41:35.08,00:41:35.08,Head back to camp. Good night.
688,00:41:47.83,00:41:47.83,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
689,00:41:53.04,00:41:53.04,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
690,00:41:55.25,00:41:55.25,>> I'm going to cry. >> PROBST: ...things get tough
691,00:41:56.96,00:41:56.96,for Lisi. >> This sucks.
692,00:42:00.21,00:42:00.21,>> PROBST: The tribes learn a new skill.
693,00:42:02.17,00:42:02.17,>> Boo is doing the whole white guy thing.
694,00:42:04.54,00:42:04.54,>> PROBST: And at Ravu... >> We should just tear this
695,00:42:06.58,00:42:06.58,place all apart. >> PROBST: ...the hunt for the
696,00:42:08.08,00:42:08.08,idol gets dirty. >> We're digging for the idol
697,00:42:10.25,00:42:10.25,while Lisi and Dreamz are sleeping.
698,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,>> Ah! I'm extremely pissed off.
699,00:42:24.21,00:42:24.21,"I'm angry. They got me good, man."
700,00:42:26.08,00:42:26.08,They got me really good. I didn't see anything coming.
701,00:42:28.25,00:42:28.25,"Then all of a sudden, boom, I get smacked in the mouth way"
702,00:42:31.21,00:42:31.21,cinder block. But you know what?
703,00:42:33.08,00:42:33.08,"Now I get to be on the jury, and hopefully none of those cats get"
704,00:42:35.04,00:42:35.04,the million bucks thanks to me.
