1,00:00:01.47,00:00:01.47,- (Jeff Probst) Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.30,00:00:03.30, Kim was upset that Brandon abandoned their alliance
3,00:00:05.97,00:00:05.97,to join forces with Lex.
4,00:00:07.87,00:00:07.87,- I was set up by somebody who I thought was my friend.
5,00:00:11.60,00:00:11.60,- (Probst) And Lex's motives were in question because of his
6,00:00:15.13,00:00:15.13,alliance with Brandon.
7,00:00:16.60,00:00:16.60,- He has no loyalty to me. He has no loyalty to Tom.
8,00:00:19.20,00:00:19.20,He has no loyalty to Kim. He only has loyalty to you.
9,00:00:22.73,00:00:22.73,- (Probst) The African bush was beginning to take its toll.
10,00:00:25.57,00:00:25.57,"- Tom's got a massive boil. I mean, it's big."
11,00:00:28.33,00:00:28.33,I've never seen a boil that big.
12,00:00:30.03,00:00:30.03,- (Probst) Lex won immunity and wanted to vote for Frank at
13,00:00:32.73,00:00:32.73,"Tribal Council, but everyone else, including Kim, joined"
14,00:00:35.60,00:00:35.60,forces and voted Brandon out of the tribe.
15,00:00:38.77,00:00:38.77,Seven are left.
16,00:00:40.40,00:00:40.40,"Tonight, one more will go."
17,00:02:00.07,00:02:00.07,"- At the last Tribal Council, we voted off Brandon, and you"
18,00:02:04.13,00:02:04.13,"know, we had been pals since our early days in Samburu."
19,00:02:07.40,00:02:07.40,"But you know, I felt very betrayed by him from the"
20,00:02:10.63,00:02:10.63,"previous Tribal Council and I didn't trust him any longer,"
21,00:02:12.70,00:02:12.70,so I had to vote him out.
22,00:02:14.57,00:02:14.57,"I guess it's all part of the game, but it still tugged at my"
23,00:02:17.00,00:02:17.00,heart a little bit.
24,00:02:21.27,00:02:21.27,"- Tom, Ethan, Kim and I are all still standing, and we've got an"
25,00:02:24.67,00:02:24.67,advantage now-- we've got everyone else outnumbered.
26,00:02:26.93,00:02:26.93,But they knew what I was pretty close to Brandon--
27,00:02:29.37,00:02:29.37,he was a friend-- and that I'd have a really hard time voting
28,00:02:32.93,00:02:32.93,"for him, and I didn't vote for him."
29,00:02:35.03,00:02:35.03,"We're still solid, right?"
30,00:02:37.07,00:02:37.07,"We're still solid from day one, right?"
31,00:02:39.00,00:02:39.00,"- 100%, absolutely."
32,00:02:40.43,00:02:40.43,- All right.
33,00:02:41.43,00:02:41.43,- All right.
34,00:02:43.60,00:02:43.60,"- Lex's vote, I think, just pushed the limits"
35,00:02:46.27,00:02:46.27,of our alliance.
36,00:02:47.60,00:02:47.60,It kind of redefined how tight our bonds were.
37,00:02:51.07,00:02:51.07,"You know, he gave his word to Brandon,"
38,00:02:53.73,00:02:53.73,"but he gave his word to us, also."
39,00:02:55.20,00:02:55.20,Lex kind of went out an his own and covered his own ass.
40,00:02:58.37,00:02:58.37,"- He gave his word to me, you and Tom,"
41,00:03:01.77,00:03:01.77,and he gave his word to Brandon.
42,00:03:03.83,00:03:03.83,Why was his word just as strong with Brandon as it was with us?
43,00:03:08.10,00:03:08.10,"- As much as Tommy, Lex and Ethan think that they want to go"
44,00:03:11.30,00:03:11.30,"into the finals, the three of them, I don't really"
45,00:03:15.27,00:03:15.27,think that they do.
46,00:03:16.83,00:03:16.83,"I think that they're all skeptical of each other,"
47,00:03:19.33,00:03:19.33,"and they know, when it gets down to"
48,00:03:20.77,00:03:20.77,"crunch time, that one of them is going to have to be voted off."
49,00:03:38.40,00:03:38.40,(rustling)
50,00:03:40.03,00:03:40.03,- What the hell was that?
51,00:03:44.30,00:03:44.30,(lion roaring loudly)
52,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,- Ho...
53,00:03:48.20,00:03:48.20,"(roaring, huffing)"
54,00:03:51.70,00:03:51.70,- Me and little Kim were on the 2:00 to 4:00 shift and out of
55,00:03:55.40,00:03:55.40,nowhere we just heard lots of heavy grunting moving closer and
56,00:03:58.67,00:03:58.67,closer and closer.
57,00:04:00.37,00:04:00.37,(lion grunting)
58,00:04:03.57,00:04:03.57,"I think the lion is probably stalking, but I don't know why"
59,00:04:06.97,00:04:06.97,it would make a noise if...
60,00:04:08.60,00:04:08.60,(roaring)
61,00:04:19.13,00:04:19.13,- I thought they made that noise when they were calling
62,00:04:22.07,00:04:22.07,other lions to come feed.
63,00:04:24.33,00:04:24.33,- You might be right.
64,00:04:26.97,00:04:26.97,"- You know what was scary, was the fact that you had no idea"
65,00:04:29.47,00:04:29.47,what the lion wanted.
66,00:04:30.77,00:04:30.77,"Are they just communicating, or is it trying to call"
67,00:04:32.47,00:04:32.47,the other lion in because it smells us?
68,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,(lion growling)
69,00:04:37.93,00:04:37.93,"Yeah, he wants to come and eat..."
70,00:04:39.93,00:04:39.93,(loud growling)
71,00:04:40.93,00:04:40.93,"Oh, my God."
72,00:04:41.93,00:04:41.93,"Oh, my God."
73,00:04:44.70,00:04:44.70,The perimeter is closed in all the way with the acacia bush or
74,00:04:48.27,00:04:48.27,"thorn bushes all the way around, but it's only maybe six feet"
75,00:04:52.13,00:04:52.13,"tall, and I'm sure a lion would be able to get up and over it"
76,00:04:54.67,00:04:54.67,if they wanted in.
77,00:04:55.97,00:04:55.97,(lion roaring loudly)
78,00:05:05.97,00:05:05.97,- It's close.
79,00:05:14.90,00:05:14.90,- I'll protect you.
80,00:05:19.77,00:05:19.77,"- Obviously, they live right here, and they must watch us"
81,00:05:22.47,00:05:22.47,every day when we go for water as we come out in the morning
82,00:05:24.93,00:05:24.93,and do stuff.
83,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97,They are really here.
84,00:05:27.10,00:05:27.10,"They are really, like, right in this area."
85,00:05:30.33,00:05:30.33,- I still feel vulnerable.
86,00:05:32.73,00:05:32.73,It's not our land at all.
87,00:05:34.77,00:05:34.77,"It's their land, and we're just living in it for 39 days."
88,00:05:38.40,00:05:38.40,(roaring)
89,00:05:43.97,00:05:43.97,"- I think it went, ""Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim."""
90,00:05:50.00,00:05:50.00,I think I heard it say that.
91,00:06:14.43,00:06:14.43,"- Hey, Zonyo!"
92,00:06:16.87,00:06:16.87,"- What's up, buster?"
93,00:06:23.87,00:06:23.87,- You just wear yourself out walking over here?
94,00:06:26.00,00:06:26.00,- I'm dead.
95,00:06:28.00,00:06:28.00,"- Having been out here now for a month, it's just starting to"
96,00:06:30.73,00:06:30.73,catch up with us.
97,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,"Everybody's started to feel more lethargic, weaker, and it all..."
98,00:06:35.70,00:06:35.70,It's interesting because it all happened at the same time.
99,00:06:39.20,00:06:39.20,And we felt comfortable admitting it because it was
100,00:06:41.07,00:06:41.07,obvious that everyone was feeling the same way.
101,00:06:43.63,00:06:43.63,- Whoa.
102,00:06:45.77,00:06:45.77,"- It feels like you're walking under water, so your steps are"
103,00:06:48.67,00:06:48.67,"slow, your legs are a little, like, shaky."
104,00:06:51.10,00:06:51.10,You don't pick your feet up as high off the ground because you
105,00:06:53.60,00:06:53.60,"just don't want to, so you kind of stumble on even just little"
106,00:06:56.23,00:06:56.23,roots this big.
107,00:06:58.93,00:06:58.93,"- Oh, mama cat."
108,00:07:01.10,00:07:01.10,- Isn't that weird?
109,00:07:02.77,00:07:02.77,- Holy mackerel.
110,00:07:04.70,00:07:04.70,"- Poor Kim Johnson, her legs are really, really swollen from"
111,00:07:08.07,00:07:08.07,her knees down.
112,00:07:09.37,00:07:09.37,I mean really swollen.
113,00:07:10.53,00:07:10.53,She can hardly lace up her sneakers.
114,00:07:12.83,00:07:12.83,- You just push it with your finger and it stays.
115,00:07:15.30,00:07:15.30,It's like Silly Putty or something.
116,00:07:17.63,00:07:17.63,- I know.
117,00:07:18.63,00:07:18.63,- It's actually almost climbing up.
118,00:07:20.93,00:07:20.93,Wait till it gets to my breasts.
119,00:07:22.23,00:07:22.23,- Whoa!
120,00:07:23.27,00:07:23.27,- Look out then!
121,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,- Our bodies are starting to show signs of trouble.
122,00:07:28.90,00:07:28.90,We're start to get sick.
123,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,"In the last couple, three days, we've all noticed that we're"
124,00:07:33.80,00:07:33.80,getting thinner.
125,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,It's starting to really show.
126,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,"- Man, you've lost a ton of weight."
127,00:07:38.70,00:07:38.70,"- Yeah, I'd say I've lost 40 pounds."
128,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,- 40 pounds?
129,00:07:43.03,00:07:43.03,Wow.
130,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,- Let's decide: do we want the mush or do we want the gruel
131,00:07:46.97,00:07:46.97,this morning?
132,00:07:49.37,00:07:49.37,"We eat two small meals a day. I figure we're having, I don't"
133,00:07:52.23,00:07:52.23,"know, maybe a couple of hundred calories, if that."
134,00:07:54.63,00:07:54.63,"And we're eating, I think, just enough to fool our bodies into"
135,00:07:56.90,00:07:56.90,thinking that we're getting nutrition when we really aren't.
136,00:07:59.00,00:07:59.00,- It's ready.
137,00:08:01.53,00:08:01.53,- We have maize.
138,00:08:03.23,00:08:03.23,"It's cornmeal, basically, is what it is, so we eat that"
139,00:08:05.90,00:08:05.90,"either in like, just, mushed-up balls we boil in water."
140,00:08:09.13,00:08:09.13,"And then we snack on, like, kernels of corn."
141,00:08:12.33,00:08:12.33,"They don't really pop, but we kind of brown them"
142,00:08:14.27,00:08:14.27,and burn them.
143,00:08:15.60,00:08:15.60,- Those are too hard for me.
144,00:08:17.00,00:08:17.00,They just-- they hurt my teeth.
145,00:08:18.20,00:08:18.20,- Mm-hmm.
146,00:08:19.37,00:08:19.37,And then we make a corn broth soup.
147,00:08:22.20,00:08:22.20,"- I'm eating it, even though I don't really want to."
148,00:08:24.40,00:08:24.40,It's just kind of a...
149,00:08:26.07,00:08:26.07,"just a watery gruel with some, you know,"
150,00:08:28.40,00:08:28.40,some corn kernels in it.
151,00:08:32.40,00:08:32.40,- It's just so hard to get down because...
152,00:08:35.40,00:08:35.40,"it's like eating chalk twice a day, and then they"
153,00:08:38.30,00:08:38.30,put corn in it and then you've got chalk with some corn.
154,00:08:43.17,00:08:43.17,- (burps)
155,00:08:51.17,00:08:51.17,- Lex is worried.
156,00:08:53.07,00:08:53.07,- He's worried because he knows I didn't like what he done.
157,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,"At the last Tribal Council, Lex cast a vote for Frank"
158,00:09:00.73,00:09:00.73,instead of Brandon.
159,00:09:02.40,00:09:02.40,"We had an alliance, me him and Ethan, and the alliance was we'd"
160,00:09:06.17,00:09:06.17,"vote together, and Lex jeopardized that alliance when"
161,00:09:11.83,00:09:11.83,he voted for Frank.
162,00:09:14.27,00:09:14.27,"- Before I came into this thing,"
163,00:09:16.27,00:09:16.27,I was totally 100% anti-alliance.
164,00:09:17.87,00:09:17.87,I wanted to do it myself and all by myself.
165,00:09:20.73,00:09:20.73,But I realized that's impossible.
166,00:09:22.77,00:09:22.77,- You can't do it.
167,00:09:23.80,00:09:23.80,- You can't do it.
168,00:09:25.70,00:09:25.70,- I felt betrayed.
169,00:09:27.47,00:09:27.47,- I don't understand why you don't let Lex know.
170,00:09:29.70,00:09:29.70,"- Because when he made that agreement with Brandon,"
171,00:09:31.87,00:09:31.87,he didn't come to me.
172,00:09:33.67,00:09:33.67,He didn't come to you either.
173,00:09:35.10,00:09:35.10,He did it on his own.
174,00:09:37.27,00:09:37.27,All he was worried about was Lex.
175,00:09:40.17,00:09:40.17,"Now he's got to thinking about me and you, right?"
176,00:09:42.57,00:09:42.57,- Yeah.
177,00:09:43.60,00:09:43.60,- Okay.
178,00:09:45.07,00:09:45.07,"- I know Tom's true to me and Kim, but probably take a little"
179,00:09:48.00,00:09:48.00,bit to get Lex back on his good side.
180,00:09:50.50,00:09:50.50,"- I don't know what'll happen in the future,"
181,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,"but from here on out, you know, I'll have question with Lex."
182,00:09:57.97,00:09:57.97,"- What's up, boys?"
183,00:09:59.23,00:09:59.23,- Hey.
184,00:09:59.23,00:09:59.23,- Hey.
185,00:10:11.87,00:10:11.87,- Mail?
186,00:10:12.93,00:10:12.93,- Can you guess the hint?
187,00:10:13.97,00:10:13.97,- That is such a cool clue!
188,00:10:17.73,00:10:17.73,- Look here.
189,00:10:18.77,00:10:18.77,"- Look, look."
190,00:10:19.97,00:10:19.97,- What's the difference between the pig and me?
191,00:10:21.10,00:10:21.10,- No boil on the pig.
192,00:10:22.13,00:10:22.13,- That's what I said!
193,00:10:23.50,00:10:23.50,"- ""You'll need all your strength for events down the road."
194,00:10:27.93,00:10:27.93,"Today is a great day for a good carbo load."""
195,00:10:31.60,00:10:31.60,- Pasta.
196,00:10:33.27,00:10:33.27,"- ""Proteins and sugars will give you power to burn."
197,00:10:38.00,00:10:38.00,"So if you are clever, these gifts you may earn."""
198,00:10:53.47,00:10:53.47,"- (Probst) All right, guys."
199,00:10:55.27,00:10:55.27,"For today's reward challenge, we thought we'd give you a break"
200,00:10:58.23,00:10:58.23,on the challenge.
201,00:10:59.57,00:10:59.57,And just make it pure reward.
202,00:11:01.27,00:11:01.27,- Yay!

509,00:19:44.47,00:19:44.47,I haven't been that excited since the bow and arrow.
510,00:19:47.13,00:19:47.13,- I cannot believe I had a pot of chocolate.
511,00:19:49.53,00:19:49.53,- That damn beer was good.
512,00:19:51.53,00:19:51.53,"- In the food auction, you could definitely see alliance"
513,00:19:55.17,00:19:55.17,lines and relationship lines that apply to the game itself.

515,00:20:01.83,00:20:01.83,Tom and Ethan have been very close too.
516,00:20:03.77,00:20:03.77,"T. Bird and Frank, no surprise there."
517,00:20:06.00,00:20:06.00,They've really only got each other at this point.
518,00:20:07.97,00:20:07.97,"And also, it was kind of painfully obvious"
519,00:20:09.90,00:20:09.90,that Kim Powers is kind of on her own.
520,00:20:13.40,00:20:13.40,But there are people taking care of her there.
521,00:20:15.23,00:20:15.23,"- Thanks, Big Tom."
522,00:20:16.67,00:20:16.67,"- I remember you sitting there, and the last thing you said,"
523,00:20:19.77,00:20:19.77,"""Oh, what I'd give for ice cream,"" and I went..."
524,00:20:23.83,00:20:23.83,- It was interesting to see who's a more clever and
525,00:20:26.57,00:20:26.57,shrewd wheeler and dealer.
526,00:20:28.00,00:20:28.00,Tom probably walked away the biggest winner as far as food.
527,00:20:31.33,00:20:31.33,"- Pancake, did you like the pancake?"
528,00:20:32.80,00:20:32.80,"- Yeah, really."

531,00:20:39.07,00:20:39.07,"- Tom, he is not the most politically correct human being,"
532,00:20:43.50,00:20:43.50,so when he said that he was sharing the ham with
533,00:20:45.33,00:20:45.33,"a Jew boy, knowing that he wasn't going to eat it,"
534,00:20:46.97,00:20:46.97,"I was like, ""Oh, my God."""
535,00:20:48.77,00:20:48.77,- I'm sorry.
536,00:20:49.80,00:20:49.80,"- Yeah, that was..."
537,00:20:51.03,00:20:51.03,"- I'm a Caucasian, call me anything."
538,00:20:53.00,00:20:53.00,What am I?
539,00:20:54.77,00:20:54.77,Call me a...
540,00:20:54.77,00:20:54.77,- A bigot.
541,00:20:57.20,00:20:57.20,- What is a bigot?
542,00:20:59.23,00:20:59.23,"- I mean, at this point, I don't really take offense."
543,00:21:01.30,00:21:01.30,I know he's joking.
544,00:21:02.47,00:21:02.47,"You know, he doesn't really mean it."
545,00:21:08.20,00:21:08.20,"- Man, you can play some checkers."
546,00:21:10.00,00:21:10.00,He thinks a lot before he moves.
547,00:21:13.83,00:21:13.83,"- Me and Tom, we have kind of like almost like a brotherly"
548,00:21:16.73,00:21:16.73,relationship right now.
549,00:21:18.23,00:21:18.23,He makes fun of me 'cause I'm Jewish and I make fun of him
550,00:21:20.43,00:21:20.43,'cause he's fat and he's got a boil on his neck
551,00:21:22.20,00:21:22.20,"and there's just, like, competition, you know,"
552,00:21:25.03,00:21:25.03,he's going to beat me at checkers.
553,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,Oh... man.
554,00:21:31.70,00:21:31.70,- Don't do that.
555,00:21:42.57,00:21:42.57,- He's a checker shark.
556,00:21:45.07,00:21:45.07,- I go back and forth on whether or not I think Tom is
557,00:21:46.60,00:21:46.60,"for real or some of it's put on, because I think he's smarter"
558,00:21:49.53,00:21:49.53,than he lets on.
559,00:21:53.00,00:21:53.00,- Stupid me.
560,00:21:55.77,00:21:55.77,"- Tommy, he plays a good old boy, but I don't think he's as"
561,00:21:58.67,00:21:58.67,backwoods-ish as he would like to make you think.
562,00:22:02.83,00:22:02.83,- Checkmate.
563,00:22:04.23,00:22:04.23,- We're just totally done already?
564,00:22:06.53,00:22:06.53,- Yeah.
565,00:22:07.77,00:22:07.77,"- Oh, my God, that's pathetic."
566,00:22:08.87,00:22:08.87,- He's very good.
567,00:22:10.87,00:22:10.87,"- You know, his whole, you know, ""I'm a hayseed from"
568,00:22:12.90,00:22:12.90,"Virginia, I'm not that smart."""
569,00:22:14.20,00:22:14.20,I knew quickly that he was a lot brighter than he let on.
570,00:22:17.53,00:22:17.53,"And actually, I mean that endeared me to him and intrigued"
571,00:22:20.27,00:22:20.27,me all the more.
572,00:22:21.87,00:22:21.87,- What do you two think you're doing?
573,00:22:23.73,00:22:23.73,- You're both going forward.
574,00:22:24.83,00:22:24.83,- You're back to back.
575,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,"- Well, the door's this way."

577,00:22:30.23,00:22:30.23,- Are you all right now?
578,00:22:31.93,00:22:31.93,- Yeah.

580,00:22:50.83,00:22:50.83,"- Yeah, those are zebra."
581,00:22:53.90,00:22:53.90,"- That's a nice, little herd, ain't it?"
582,00:22:55.37,00:22:55.37,"- Yeah, a big herd."
583,00:22:56.97,00:22:56.97,- Thundering herd.
584,00:23:05.17,00:23:05.17,"- Hey, mama cat, bring it on up here."
585,00:23:09.40,00:23:09.40,- Okay.
586,00:23:11.10,00:23:11.10,"- We have been kind of in a routine, so today, to keep"
587,00:23:14.20,00:23:14.20,"things fresh, we went to our watering hole, put our stuff"
588,00:23:16.43,00:23:16.43,down and Big Tom gave everyone a little shower.
589,00:23:21.07,00:23:21.07,"- Oh, man."
590,00:23:22.30,00:23:22.30,"- Tommy, I'll take a shower."
591,00:23:23.43,00:23:23.43,"- Okay, brother."
592,00:23:26.03,00:23:26.03,"- We have been here a while, and we were getting pretty"
593,00:23:29.27,00:23:29.27,"comfortable with each other,"
594,00:23:30.60,00:23:30.60,and I can change without being too
595,00:23:32.30,00:23:32.30,worried if anyone sees me.
596,00:23:33.73,00:23:33.73,"You know, I can fart, you know, and not really care."
597,00:23:40.03,00:23:40.03,"- All right, girls, back off."
598,00:23:42.93,00:23:42.93,- You can douse me.
599,00:23:44.93,00:23:44.93,"When you spend 30 days with people in very close proximity,"
600,00:23:48.27,00:23:48.27,you're not ashamed or bashful of just about anything anymore.
601,00:23:51.80,00:23:51.80,"I mean, we've lived together closer than most families live"
602,00:23:54.37,00:23:54.37,"together and bathing or whatever, it just seems like"
603,00:23:57.83,00:23:57.83,"it's something that you kind of have to do it, and you really"
604,00:24:00.13,00:24:00.13,don't care who sees you anymore.
605,00:24:06.10,00:24:06.10,- Tom's loving every minute of it.
606,00:24:10.50,00:24:10.50,"- Woo-hoo, does that feel good!"
607,00:24:13.90,00:24:13.90,- Tom gets away with murder.
608,00:24:15.37,00:24:15.37,"Like today, you know, he was having a good time bathing the"
609,00:24:17.63,00:24:17.63,"ladies, having them kind of pull their bathing suits back."
610,00:24:24.60,00:24:24.60,- Don't think Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
611,00:24:27.63,00:24:27.63,- Tom's not washing you...
612,00:24:29.43,00:24:29.43,at all.
613,00:24:32.93,00:24:32.93,"- I mean, Tommy's harmless."
614,00:24:34.37,00:24:34.37,"It's not, like, he's going to, like, jump our bones there"
615,00:24:36.13,00:24:36.13,or anything.
616,00:24:37.53,00:24:37.53,"He's really harmless and if he gets a peek, you know,"
617,00:24:39.07,00:24:39.07,more power to him.
618,00:24:40.10,00:24:40.10,It doesn't do any good for anybody
619,00:24:41.77,00:24:41.77,to take offense at anybody.
620,00:24:43.23,00:24:43.23,"It only costs you friendship, and this whole exercise out here"
621,00:24:45.57,00:24:45.57,I think is about getting along with people and just going
622,00:24:47.93,00:24:47.93,with the flow.
623,00:24:49.33,00:24:49.33,- One for the road!
624,00:24:54.03,00:24:54.03,- Encore!
625,00:24:56.67,00:24:56.67,- We have been here a while and we're getting pretty comfortable
626,00:24:59.37,00:24:59.37,"with each other, and it's like your family now."
627,00:25:02.33,00:25:02.33,"And it makes everything a little more difficult because tomorrow,"
628,00:25:05.27,00:25:05.27,I'm going to have to vote one of these people off.
629,00:25:17.27,00:25:17.27,"- (Probst) Hey, guys, welcome to this abandoned boma."
630,00:25:20.67,00:25:20.67,You'll be playing today's challenge here.
631,00:25:23.30,00:25:23.30,"As always, first things first."
632,00:25:25.50,00:25:25.50,I'll take this back.
633,00:25:27.67,00:25:27.67,Immunity is back up for grabs.
634,00:25:32.10,00:25:32.10,Okay.
635,00:25:33.70,00:25:33.70,Today's challenge is going to test how well you remember
636,00:25:36.60,00:25:36.60,the African story I'm about to tell you.
637,00:25:39.20,00:25:39.20,"But first, here's what you'll have to do."
638,00:25:41.80,00:25:41.80,"We've set up seven gated stations, and only one person at"
639,00:25:44.57,00:25:44.57,"a time can be there,"
640,00:25:46.23,00:25:46.23,so make sure you close the gate behind you.
641,00:25:49.00,00:25:49.00,Each station has a question and two ostrich eggs.
642,00:25:51.20,00:25:51.20,Break open the egg for the correct answer.
643,00:25:53.30,00:25:53.30,You'll find a piece of colored leather.
644,00:25:55.27,00:25:55.27,Wrap that around the same color on your staff.
645,00:25:57.23,00:25:57.23,"If you answer incorrectly, you'll find nothing, you'll have"
646,00:25:58.97,00:25:58.97,to try again later.
647,00:26:00.47,00:26:00.47,The eggs will be replaced after each person leaves the station.
648,00:26:03.40,00:26:03.40,First person back in the circle with five of the seven questions
649,00:26:05.90,00:26:05.90,answered correctly and five pieces of leather on their staff
650,00:26:09.80,00:26:09.80,wins immunity.
651,00:26:11.50,00:26:11.50,"Okay, story time."
652,00:26:13.37,00:26:13.37,"Today, I'm going to tell you about the Samburu warrior."
653,00:26:15.73,00:26:15.73,"When a baby boy is born, his destiny is already planned."
654,00:26:19.40,00:26:19.40,"To celebrate the birth, a goat is sacrificed."
655,00:26:22.90,00:26:22.90,The women of the tribe eat the meat of the goat because
656,00:26:24.67,00:26:24.67,the women are the caretakers of the tribe.
657,00:26:26.77,00:26:26.77,"For the first four days after the birth, the mother drinks"
658,00:26:30.30,00:26:30.30,only the blood of the goat.
659,00:26:32.10,00:26:32.10,"Around the age of nine or ten,"
660,00:26:33.80,00:26:33.80,the boy has his first rite of passage.
661,00:26:36.33,00:26:36.33,This is the removal of his two bottom middle teeth because if
662,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,he were to get sick and they needed to get food or water into
663,00:26:42.53,00:26:42.53,"his body, they use the gap from the two missing teeth as a way"
664,00:26:44.90,00:26:44.90,to do that.
665,00:26:46.27,00:26:46.27,It's also around this time that he begins the practice of
666,00:26:48.53,00:26:48.53,piercing his ears.
667,00:26:49.70,00:26:49.70,This is the first cosmetic enhancement.
668,00:26:51.27,00:26:51.27,"His next rite of passage is a circumcision, and that begins"
669,00:26:54.80,00:26:54.80,with a journey to find gum from a special tree.
670,00:26:59.07,00:26:59.07,"It could take him as long 45 days, during which he can only"
671,00:27:02.07,00:27:02.07,subsist on the generosity of others--
672,00:27:04.63,00:27:04.63,the food that he gets along the way.
673,00:27:06.80,00:27:06.80,"Once he's completed his mission,"
674,00:27:08.47,00:27:08.47,a date for the circumcision is set.
675,00:27:10.57,00:27:10.57,Dates are scheduled based on the new moon.
676,00:27:13.27,00:27:13.27,The tribe will wait for any even-numbered day of moonlight.
677,00:27:17.20,00:27:17.20,"Eighth day, considered the best day."
678,00:27:19.97,00:27:19.97,"In preparation for a circumcision, shaves his head."
679,00:27:22.73,00:27:22.73,But the most important aspect to a circumcision
680,00:27:24.77,00:27:24.77,is a warrior's reaction.
681,00:27:26.47,00:27:26.47,"If, during the circumcision, he flinches in any way,"
682,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63,he and his family are forever shamed.
683,00:27:31.53,00:27:31.53,"After eight years of warriorship,"
684,00:27:33.20,00:27:33.20,he's eligible for marriage.
685,00:27:35.23,00:27:35.23,Tribal custom demands that he continue to have kids until he
686,00:27:38.33,00:27:38.33,"has a boy, even if that means taking another wife and another."
687,00:27:41.73,00:27:41.73,The last step: Death.
688,00:27:43.40,00:27:43.40,"Once a warrior is close to death, he is taken into the bush"
689,00:27:46.83,00:27:46.83,with another warrior and left to die.
690,00:27:49.90,00:27:49.90,"Once he dies, fellow warriors shave their heads out of"
691,00:27:53.63,00:27:53.63,"respect, and his body is left for the hyenas to eat."
692,00:27:56.70,00:27:56.70,"From birth to death, a hard life."
693,00:27:59.37,00:27:59.37,Now we're going to see what you've learned.
694,00:28:01.43,00:28:01.43,Grab your staffs and let's get it on.
695,00:28:06.03,00:28:06.03,Survivors ready?
696,00:28:08.30,00:28:08.30,Go!
697,00:28:10.70,00:28:10.70,Make sure you close your gates.
698,00:28:22.23,00:28:22.23,- Food provided by others.
699,00:28:27.70,00:28:27.70,"- ""What happens after a warrior dies?"""
700,00:28:42.83,00:28:42.83,"- Oh, hell."
701,00:28:44.70,00:28:44.70,"Well, I can't cry over spilt milk."
702,00:28:47.50,00:28:47.50,I missed it.
703,00:28:48.93,00:28:48.93,"- (Probst) Frank and Lex, each with one."

713,00:29:48.20,00:29:48.20,- (Probst) Lex and Frank in the lead with two each.
714,00:29:52.97,00:29:52.97,"- Oh, hell."
715,00:29:54.70,00:29:54.70,That ain't right.
716,00:30:00.67,00:30:00.67,"- ""Body left in the bush for hyenas to eat."""
717,00:30:02.93,00:30:02.93,Or maybe not!

719,00:30:22.37,00:30:22.37,- (Probst) Lex and Frank lead with four.
720,00:30:25.40,00:30:25.40,Everybody else at three.
721,00:30:37.97,00:30:37.97,"- (Probst) You got it, Lex?"
722,00:30:40.97,00:30:40.97,"- One, two, three, four."
723,00:30:42.77,00:30:42.77,I dropped one.
724,00:30:44.27,00:30:44.27,"- (Probst) Gotta find it, Lex."
725,00:30:45.40,00:30:45.40,Gotta find it.
726,00:30:46.77,00:30:46.77,"Lex says he has five, but he can't find his fifth."
727,00:31:00.43,00:31:00.43,"Get it on there, baby."
728,00:31:04.87,00:31:04.87,Lex trying to get his in the right spot.
729,00:31:06.97,00:31:06.97,We're still alive.
730,00:31:09.53,00:31:09.53,- God.
731,00:31:11.00,00:31:11.00,I've got to be careful.
732,00:31:13.93,00:31:13.93,- Lex wins immunity again.
733,00:31:20.90,00:31:20.90,"Lex, again, you're not going down."
734,00:31:25.53,00:31:25.53,Congratulations.
735,00:31:25.53,00:31:25.53,- Thanks.
736,00:31:27.60,00:31:27.60,- (Probst) You're safe from the vote.
737,00:31:29.47,00:31:29.47,Somebody else is going home.
738,00:31:31.57,00:31:31.57,I'll see you at Tribal Council.
739,00:32:01.77,00:32:01.77,- To be here is just awesome.
740,00:32:04.33,00:32:04.33,"This morning's sunrise is just, is just, so beautiful."
741,00:32:07.80,00:32:07.80,"You know, I don't think the majority of people in our"

743,00:32:13.50,00:32:13.50,"as beautiful as that, and to suddenly realize just how small"
744,00:32:16.77,00:32:16.77,"we are in the world, and how time can just pass by in a"
745,00:32:20.00,00:32:20.00,moment and we would be gone.
746,00:32:21.97,00:32:21.97,"You know, it puts your life back in perspective."
747,00:32:26.50,00:32:26.50,- Nice sunrise.
748,00:32:28.30,00:32:28.30,"- Oh, my God."
749,00:32:30.70,00:32:30.70,- Look at that.
750,00:32:34.07,00:32:34.07,- My love for being here grows every day.
751,00:32:37.03,00:32:37.03,"Just loving the outdoors, you know, and the animals and"
752,00:32:39.87,00:32:39.87,"wildlife and people in a way, as well, you know, I love to mingle"
753,00:32:43.50,00:32:43.50,with people.
754,00:32:44.50,00:32:44.50,"Good morning, Ethan."
755,00:32:46.33,00:32:46.33,- Good morning.
756,00:32:47.43,00:32:47.43,- How are you?
757,00:32:47.43,00:32:47.43,- Good.
758,00:32:49.37,00:32:49.37,- Breakfast.

760,00:32:51.53,00:32:51.53,- Uh-huh.
761,00:32:52.63,00:32:52.63,- I love your soup.
762,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,- You love my soup?
763,00:32:53.83,00:32:53.83,- I love the soup.
764,00:32:55.47,00:32:55.47,- Good.
765,00:32:56.53,00:32:56.53,"Good, good, good."
766,00:32:57.93,00:32:57.93,"- As always, very tasty."
767,00:32:59.27,00:32:59.27,"I mean, really."
768,00:33:00.77,00:33:00.77,"- It's just a beautiful morning, so I was just adding to"
769,00:33:05.70,00:33:05.70,"the wonderful atmosphere and just socializing and, you know,"
770,00:33:09.77,00:33:09.77,"let them see there's a soft, sensual side of me."
771,00:33:13.87,00:33:13.87,"My argument always with the gun, you know, activist, is that"
772,00:33:17.27,00:33:17.27,they think that guns kill people.
773,00:33:20.33,00:33:20.33,"There's, like... there's everything else you could kill"
774,00:33:23.53,00:33:23.53,"someone with, you know, a piece of fishing line I can kill"
775,00:33:24.97,00:33:24.97,somebody with.
776,00:33:26.03,00:33:26.03,- Hit them over the head with a brick.
777,00:33:27.47,00:33:27.47,"- You know, automobiles kill people every day, drug overdose,"
778,00:33:29.53,00:33:29.53,"malpractice, just everything."
779,00:33:32.03,00:33:32.03,"- All right, enough."
780,00:33:34.03,00:33:34.03,- Frank seems really rambunctious this morning
781,00:33:35.30,00:33:35.30,and he's talking a lot.
782,00:33:37.00,00:33:37.00,"And he's a very opinionated person, which is fine, but,"
783,00:33:40.50,00:33:40.50,"like, when you have immunity at stake, you kind of just need to"
784,00:33:43.33,00:33:43.33,keep your mouth shut.
785,00:33:44.47,00:33:44.47,- I can't help it.
786,00:33:45.93,00:33:45.93,"These little, liberal special interest groups that the media"
787,00:33:47.93,00:33:47.93,give open market to instead of the average working-class
788,00:33:49.90,00:33:49.90,Americans that founded this country.
789,00:33:51.33,00:33:51.33,- All right! All right!
790,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,"- Well, what can I say about Frank?"
791,00:33:54.50,00:33:54.50,"Once again, Frank is Frank."
792,00:33:56.53,00:33:56.53,"- You know, Ray might invite me to their banquet,"
793,00:33:58.53,00:33:58.53,their convention down there.
794,00:34:00.23,00:34:00.23,- Perfect.
795,00:34:01.50,00:34:01.50,- He brings up this gun stuff.
796,00:34:03.30,00:34:03.30,"And Lex is going like this, you know."
797,00:34:06.10,00:34:06.10,"Ethan's sitting over there, not saying a word, but I can tell"
798,00:34:08.07,00:34:08.07,"it's getting to him, too."
799,00:34:09.37,00:34:09.37,"And I'm thinking to myself, Frank, cut it, stop."
800,00:34:12.07,00:34:12.07,Why is it on the days that you need to be most careful of how
801,00:34:14.63,00:34:14.63,"you act and what you say, Frank, like, goes off on the A.R. or"
802,00:34:18.17,00:34:18.17,whatever stuff?
803,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,- Yeah.
804,00:34:21.07,00:34:21.07,"Well, that's just the way... he ain't going to change."
805,00:34:26.17,00:34:26.17,- Today is Tribal Council day.
806,00:34:27.50,00:34:27.50,Today is the day that you don't
807,00:34:29.43,00:34:29.43,want to really ruffle any feathers.
808,00:34:31.67,00:34:31.67,"But, you know, I started out from the very beginning with an"
809,00:34:34.77,00:34:34.77,"alliance with Frank, and shoot,"
810,00:34:36.43,00:34:36.43,I've been here for this many days.
811,00:34:38.90,00:34:38.90,I'm sure not going to give up now.
812,00:34:42.83,00:34:42.83,- This is all going exactly as we wanted it to.
813,00:34:46.23,00:34:46.23,Things couldn't be any better.
814,00:34:49.93,00:34:49.93,- The guys have dominated the game.
815,00:34:52.93,00:34:52.93,They're saying who goes next.
816,00:34:54.43,00:34:54.43,"If nothing else, I'd like to see the women get in there."
817,00:34:57.43,00:34:57.43,- Right.
818,00:34:59.23,00:34:59.23,"- Teresa doesn't want to give up,"
819,00:35:00.47,00:35:00.47,and I don't want to give up either.
820,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,"So, Teresa is, like, trying to scramble and figure out"
821,00:35:04.27,00:35:04.27,it there's anything that we can do.
822,00:35:05.93,00:35:05.93,- Ethan's going to take the whole thing.
823,00:35:08.93,00:35:08.93,He's great.
824,00:35:10.00,00:35:10.00,What can you say negative about Ethan?
825,00:35:11.83,00:35:11.83,Nothing.
826,00:35:13.37,00:35:13.37,"- It's a shot in the dark, but if I can persuade Kim to vote"
827,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,"off Ethan, that would break up that alliance."
828,00:35:18.97,00:35:18.97,- If Ethan's not here...
829,00:35:20.80,00:35:20.80,"- That would leave Kim, you, me and Frank."
830,00:35:23.13,00:35:23.13,"- You, me and Frank."
831,00:35:24.30,00:35:24.30,- And then you're going to stick by Frank.
832,00:35:25.93,00:35:25.93,- No.
833,00:35:27.40,00:35:27.40,"If you do this tonight, then I'll pledge my loyalty to you."
834,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,"It could hurt me going to Kim, but Ethan's bonded with those"
835,00:35:35.10,00:35:35.10,"guys, and they're going to be strong enough every time they"
836,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03,vote to weed off one more of us.
837,00:35:38.97,00:35:38.97,"So it's kind of a risk, but at this point, I feel like this is"
838,00:35:42.47,00:35:42.47,the only chance I've got.
839,00:35:44.43,00:35:44.43,- I was really shocked and pissed
840,00:35:46.43,00:35:46.43,"that they would even, you know...."
841,00:35:48.03,00:35:48.03,"- Well, they're cornered."
842,00:35:49.07,00:35:49.07,They have no options.
843,00:35:51.10,00:35:51.10,"- Teresa approached me with the idea that Tommy, Lex and Ethan"
844,00:35:54.13,00:35:54.13,"really don't have any kind of allegiance toward me,"
845,00:35:57.63,00:35:57.63,but I just can't turn on Ethan at this point.
846,00:36:00.87,00:36:00.87,"So I'm going to have to tell Teresa that, and I'm not sure"
847,00:36:03.60,00:36:03.60,what the reaction is going to be to that.
848,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,"I just think, so really, that I think I might still be shooting"
849,00:36:07.63,00:36:07.63,"myself in the foot, even if I could bring myself to it do it."
850,00:36:09.53,00:36:09.53,"- Okay, I understand."
851,00:36:11.43,00:36:11.43,I just appreciate you're telling us so we can do different stuff.
852,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43,"- I had an opportunity, obviously, to do something to"
853,00:36:19.10,00:36:19.10,"save them, and I didn't do that."
854,00:36:20.60,00:36:20.60,And now I'm afraid it's going to hurt me.
855,00:36:23.27,00:36:23.27,- This plan's not coming together.
856,00:36:25.33,00:36:25.33,- I know it's not.
857,00:36:27.67,00:36:27.67,"- So, it'll be an interesting Tribal Council."
858,00:36:44.87,00:36:44.87,- (Probst) We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
859,00:36:56.53,00:36:56.53,30 days.
860,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,Congratulations.
861,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,You made it a long ways.
862,00:37:01.93,00:37:01.93,Basically a month out here on your own.
863,00:37:03.93,00:37:03.93,"Well, obviously, from this point forward, the power shifts from"
864,00:37:09.07,00:37:09.07,the tribe members left to the jury that is growing.
865,00:37:12.37,00:37:12.37,Your dilemma is obvious: How can you vote somebody out of this
866,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,"game, take that million dollars out of their hand and then ask"
867,00:37:18.53,00:37:18.53,them to put it in your hands by voting you most deserving?
868,00:37:20.83,00:37:20.83,"Teresa, what goes through your head now as you show up tonight"
869,00:37:23.57,00:37:23.57,and here's Brandon and Kelly?
870,00:37:24.87,00:37:24.87,"People you had a hand in voting out,"
871,00:37:26.73,00:37:26.73,you're going to need them later.
872,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,"- For me, I guess it takes just the way I play the game,"
873,00:37:32.03,00:37:32.03,"trying to be as honest with everybody,"
874,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,"you know, that I could be, so at this point,"
875,00:37:36.60,00:37:36.60,it's just playing as fair as I can and hope that
876,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,"they'll respect, you know, my decisions and how I played."
877,00:37:41.63,00:37:41.63,"- (Probst) Ethan, one of you seven is going tonight."
878,00:37:44.50,00:37:44.50,"Next Tribal Council, they'll be sitting over there."
879,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,How can you vote them out
880,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,and ask them to vote for you at the end?
881,00:37:51.70,00:37:51.70,"- Well, you've just got to hope that what you did before the"
882,00:37:55.93,00:37:55.93,"vote and how you treated people before the vote will, you know,"
883,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,put you in a good light.
884,00:38:02.57,00:38:02.57,"It is just a game, and if you get voted out,"
885,00:38:06.00,00:38:06.00,it's just a strategy.
886,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,You've got to look out for yourself in the end.
887,00:38:09.80,00:38:09.80,"- (Probst) Lex, how close is this game to turning ugly?"
888,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,- I think the game has already gone through some ugly times.
889,00:38:16.03,00:38:16.03,I think it's taken a turn for the better.
890,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,It's probably going to get ugly again.
891,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,"But everyone here, whether they're, you know, sitting up"
892,00:38:22.77,00:38:22.77,"here or on the jury, realizes, though, that they came to play"
893,00:38:26.23,00:38:26.23,a game and to win.
894,00:38:27.63,00:38:27.63,"And you can do that with integrity, but to come in here"
895,00:38:31.13,00:38:31.13,"thinking that it's never going to be, you know,"
896,00:38:34.13,00:38:34.13,just a bones-to-bones competition is to be naive.
897,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,"- (Probst) Frank, do you feel like it's still the old Samburu"
898,00:38:40.83,00:38:40.83,and the old Boran when it comes down to voting?
899,00:38:42.80,00:38:42.80,"- Not really because the game is changing, you know."
900,00:38:45.43,00:38:45.43,I think those old tribal names are gone.
901,00:38:47.50,00:38:47.50,"Our tribe had a new name, everyone belonged to it."
902,00:38:50.43,00:38:50.43,I think it's a strategy within the new tribe.
903,00:38:54.77,00:38:54.77,"- (Probst) Kim, do you feel that you might be safer because maybe"
904,00:38:57.63,00:38:57.63,"people don't see you as such a physical threat,"
905,00:38:59.97,00:38:59.97,or are you worried that maybe you're too likable
906,00:39:01.97,00:39:01.97,"and, therefore, you've got to go?"
907,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,- I'm always worried.
908,00:39:04.43,00:39:04.43,I think I would be worried if I were strong and I'm worried
909,00:39:07.10,00:39:07.10,because I'm not so strong.
910,00:39:08.77,00:39:08.77,It doesn't matter how nice I am
911,00:39:10.23,00:39:10.23,or how weak I am or how strong I am.
912,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37,"If I'm the logical person to go, I'm going."
913,00:39:14.97,00:39:14.97,"- All right, it's time to vote."
914,00:39:16.90,00:39:16.90,Lex is the only one you can't vote for.
915,00:39:18.73,00:39:18.73,Everybody else is fair game.
916,00:39:19.80,00:39:19.80,"Kim, you're up first."
917,00:39:30.30,00:39:30.30,"- I've enjoyed you as a person, but we have to vote somebody off"
918,00:39:32.87,00:39:32.87,and you're my next logical choice.
919,00:39:35.03,00:39:35.03,"I'll miss you, though."
920,00:39:51.90,00:39:51.90,- It's been good for me to be around someone so different from
921,00:39:54.40,00:39:54.40,myself and learn from you.
922,00:39:55.83,00:39:55.83,I'm glad that we actually got to spend some time together.
923,00:40:18.87,00:40:18.87,- This is not a vote of betrayal.
924,00:40:21.47,00:40:21.47,This is a vote of strategy.
925,00:40:23.33,00:40:23.33,"Frank, thank you so much for the friendship."
926,00:40:40.83,00:40:40.83,- I'll go tally the votes.
927,00:41:06.87,00:41:06.87,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
928,00:41:08.47,00:41:08.47,The person will be asked
929,00:41:09.83,00:41:09.83,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
930,00:41:11.23,00:41:11.23,I'll read the votes.
931,00:41:14.63,00:41:14.63,First vote: Frank.
932,00:41:24.73,00:41:24.73,Kim Johnson.
933,00:41:29.60,00:41:29.60,Frank.
934,00:41:36.27,00:41:36.27,Frank.
935,00:41:37.27,00:41:37.27,"Three votes Frank, one vote Kim."
936,00:41:46.53,00:41:46.53,Frank.
937,00:41:47.90,00:41:47.90,"That's enough, Frank."
938,00:41:48.97,00:41:48.97,You need to bring me your torch.
939,00:41:56.00,00:41:56.00,"Frank, the tribe has spoken."
940,00:42:05.07,00:42:05.07,It's time for you to go.
941,00:42:15.37,00:42:15.37,You guys can head back to camp.
942,00:42:30.20,00:42:30.20,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
943,00:42:33.93,00:42:33.93,- (Probst) Next time on Survivor:
944,00:42:35.60,00:42:35.60,Teresa pushes the all-girl alliance.
945,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,- I really don't want to see the guys come down to the end.
946,00:42:39.90,00:42:39.90,"- Hi, Mom."
947,00:42:39.90,00:42:39.90,"- Bye, babies."
948,00:42:41.37,00:42:41.37,- (Probst) The members of Moto Maji get videos from home.
949,00:42:44.37,00:42:44.37,And the winner of the reward challenge
950,00:42:47.43,00:42:47.43,takes the trip of a lifetime.
951,00:42:58.70,00:42:58.70,"- To my lovely wife, Polly, and my daughters, Jocelyn Rose"
952,00:43:00.83,00:43:00.83,and Sage Hunter.
953,00:43:02.33,00:43:02.33,Thank you for your unselfish sacrifices you made so I could
954,00:43:05.70,00:43:05.70,go on this adventure.
955,00:43:07.17,00:43:07.17,"I give you my word of honor that down the road, I will make"
956,00:43:11.83,00:43:11.83,all your dreams come true.
957,00:43:13.67,00:43:13.67,"As your husband, as your father and as your friend, I love you"
958,00:43:16.93,00:43:16.93,"and I miss you, thank you."
