1,00:00:03.30,00:00:03.30, Kim was upset that Brandonabandoned their alliance
2,00:00:05.97,00:00:05.97,to join forces with Lex.
3,00:00:07.87,00:00:07.87,- I was set up by somebody whoI thought was my friend.
4,00:00:11.60,00:00:11.60,- (Probst) And Lex's motiveswere in question because of his
5,00:00:15.13,00:00:15.13,alliance with Brandon.
6,00:00:16.60,00:00:16.60,- He has no loyalty to me.He has no loyalty to Tom.
7,00:00:19.20,00:00:19.20,He has no loyalty to Kim.He only has loyalty to you.
8,00:00:22.73,00:00:22.73,- (Probst) The African bush wasbeginning to take its toll.
9,00:00:25.57,00:00:25.57,"- Tom's got a massive boil.I mean, it's big."
10,00:00:28.33,00:00:28.33,I've never seena boil that big.
11,00:00:30.03,00:00:30.03,- (Probst) Lex won immunity andwanted to vote for Frank at
12,00:00:32.73,00:00:32.73,"Tribal Council, but everyoneelse, including Kim, joined"
13,00:00:35.60,00:00:35.60,forces and voted Brandonout of the tribe.
14,00:00:38.77,00:00:38.77,Seven are left.
15,00:00:40.40,00:00:40.40,"Tonight,one more will go."
16,00:02:00.07,00:02:00.07,"- At the last Tribal Council,we voted off Brandon, and you"
17,00:02:04.13,00:02:04.13,"know, we had been pals since ourearly days in Samburu."
18,00:02:07.40,00:02:07.40,"But you know, I feltvery betrayed by him from the"
19,00:02:10.63,00:02:10.63,"previous Tribal Council and Ididn't trust him any longer,"
20,00:02:12.70,00:02:12.70,so I had to vote him out.
21,00:02:14.57,00:02:14.57,"I guess it's all part of thegame, but it still tugged at my"
22,00:02:17.00,00:02:17.00,heart a little bit.
23,00:02:21.27,00:02:21.27,"- Tom, Ethan, Kim and I are allstill standing, and we've got an"
24,00:02:24.67,00:02:24.67,advantage now-- we've goteveryone else outnumbered.
25,00:02:26.93,00:02:26.93,But they knew what I was prettyclose to Brandon--
26,00:02:29.37,00:02:29.37,he was a friend-- and that I'dhave a really hard time voting
27,00:02:32.93,00:02:32.93,"for him, and I didn'tvote for him."
28,00:02:35.03,00:02:35.03,"We're still solid, right?"
29,00:02:37.07,00:02:37.07,"We're still solidfrom day one, right?"
30,00:02:39.00,00:02:39.00,"- 100%, absolutely."
31,00:02:40.43,00:02:40.43,- All right.
32,00:02:41.43,00:02:41.43,- All right.
33,00:02:43.60,00:02:43.60,"- Lex's vote, I think,just pushed the limits"
34,00:02:46.27,00:02:46.27,of our alliance.
35,00:02:47.60,00:02:47.60,It kind of redefined how tightour bonds were.
36,00:02:51.07,00:02:51.07,"You know, he gavehis word to Brandon,"
37,00:02:53.73,00:02:53.73,"but he gave his word tous, also."
38,00:02:55.20,00:02:55.20,Lex kind of went out an his ownand covered his own ass.
39,00:02:58.37,00:02:58.37,"- He gave his word to me,you and Tom,"
40,00:03:01.77,00:03:01.77,and he gave his word toBrandon.
41,00:03:03.83,00:03:03.83,Why was his word just as strongwith Brandon as it was with us?
42,00:03:08.10,00:03:08.10,"- As much as Tommy, Lex andEthan think that they want to go"
43,00:03:11.30,00:03:11.30,"into the finals, the threeof them, I don't really"
44,00:03:15.27,00:03:15.27,think that they do.
45,00:03:16.83,00:03:16.83,"I think that they're allskeptical of each other,"
46,00:03:19.33,00:03:19.33,"and they know,when it gets down to"
47,00:03:20.77,00:03:20.77,"crunch time, that one of them isgoing to have to be voted off."
48,00:03:38.40,00:03:38.40,(rustling)
49,00:03:40.03,00:03:40.03,- What the hell was that?
50,00:03:44.30,00:03:44.30,(lion roaring loudly)
51,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,- Ho...
52,00:03:48.20,00:03:48.20,"(roaring, huffing)"
53,00:03:51.70,00:03:51.70,- Me and little Kim were on the2:00 to 4:00 shift and out of
54,00:03:55.40,00:03:55.40,nowhere we just heard lots ofheavy grunting moving closer and
55,00:03:58.67,00:03:58.67,closer and closer.
56,00:04:00.37,00:04:00.37,(lion grunting)
57,00:04:03.57,00:04:03.57,"I think the lion is probablystalking, but I don't know why"
58,00:04:06.97,00:04:06.97,it would make a noise if...
59,00:04:08.60,00:04:08.60,(roaring)
60,00:04:19.13,00:04:19.13,- I thought they made thatnoise when they were calling
61,00:04:22.07,00:04:22.07,other lions to come feed.
62,00:04:24.33,00:04:24.33,- You might be right.
63,00:04:26.97,00:04:26.97,"- You know what was scary, wasthe fact that you had no idea"
64,00:04:29.47,00:04:29.47,what the lion wanted.
65,00:04:30.77,00:04:30.77,"Are they just communicating,or is it trying to call"
66,00:04:32.47,00:04:32.47,the other lion inbecause it smells us?
67,00:04:34.83,00:04:34.83,(lion growling)
68,00:04:37.93,00:04:37.93,"Yeah, he wantsto come and eat..."
69,00:04:39.93,00:04:39.93,(loud growling)
70,00:04:40.93,00:04:40.93,"Oh, my God."
71,00:04:41.93,00:04:41.93,"Oh, my God."
72,00:04:44.70,00:04:44.70,The perimeter is closed in allthe way with the acacia bush or
73,00:04:48.27,00:04:48.27,"thorn bushes all the way around,but it's only maybe six feet"
74,00:04:52.13,00:04:52.13,"tall, and I'm sure a lion wouldbe able to get up and over it"
75,00:04:54.67,00:04:54.67,if they wanted in.
76,00:04:55.97,00:04:55.97,(lion roaring loudly)
77,00:05:05.97,00:05:05.97,- It's close.
78,00:05:14.90,00:05:14.90,- I'll protect you.
79,00:05:19.77,00:05:19.77,"- Obviously, they live righthere, and they must watch us"
80,00:05:22.47,00:05:22.47,every day when we go for wateras we come out in the morning
81,00:05:24.93,00:05:24.93,and do stuff.
82,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97,They are really here.
83,00:05:27.10,00:05:27.10,"They are really,like, right in this area."
84,00:05:30.33,00:05:30.33,- I still feel vulnerable.
85,00:05:32.73,00:05:32.73,It's not our land at all.
86,00:05:34.77,00:05:34.77,"It's their land, and we're justliving in it for 39 days."
87,00:05:38.40,00:05:38.40,(roaring)
88,00:05:43.97,00:05:43.97,"- I think it went, ""Kim, Kim,Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim."""
89,00:05:50.00,00:05:50.00,I think I heard it say that.
90,00:06:14.43,00:06:14.43,"- Hey, Zonyo!"
91,00:06:16.87,00:06:16.87,"- What's up, buster?"
92,00:06:23.87,00:06:23.87,- You just wear yourself outwalking over here?
93,00:06:26.00,00:06:26.00,- I'm dead.
94,00:06:28.00,00:06:28.00,"- Having been out here now fora month, it's just starting to"
95,00:06:30.73,00:06:30.73,catch up with us.
96,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,"Everybody's started to feel morelethargic, weaker, and it all..."
97,00:06:35.70,00:06:35.70,It's interesting because it allhappened at the same time.
98,00:06:39.20,00:06:39.20,And we felt comfortableadmitting it because it was
99,00:06:41.07,00:06:41.07,obvious that everyone wasfeeling the same way.
100,00:06:43.63,00:06:43.63,- Whoa.
101,00:06:45.77,00:06:45.77,"- It feels like you're walkingunder water, so your steps are"
102,00:06:48.67,00:06:48.67,"slow, your legs are a little,like, shaky."
103,00:06:51.10,00:06:51.10,You don't pick your feet up ashigh off the ground because you
104,00:06:53.60,00:06:53.60,"just don't want to, so you kindof stumble on even just little"
105,00:06:56.23,00:06:56.23,roots this big.
106,00:06:58.93,00:06:58.93,"- Oh, mama cat."
107,00:07:01.10,00:07:01.10,- Isn't that weird?
108,00:07:02.77,00:07:02.77,- Holy mackerel.
109,00:07:04.70,00:07:04.70,"- Poor Kim Johnson, her legsare really, really swollen from"
110,00:07:08.07,00:07:08.07,her knees down.
111,00:07:09.37,00:07:09.37,I mean really swollen.
112,00:07:10.53,00:07:10.53,She can hardly lace upher sneakers.
113,00:07:12.83,00:07:12.83,- You just push it withyour finger and it stays.
114,00:07:15.30,00:07:15.30,It's like Silly Puttyor something.
115,00:07:17.63,00:07:17.63,- I know.
116,00:07:18.63,00:07:18.63,- It's actuallyalmost climbing up.
117,00:07:20.93,00:07:20.93,Wait till it getsto my breasts.
118,00:07:22.23,00:07:22.23,- Whoa!
119,00:07:23.27,00:07:23.27,- Look out then!
120,00:07:26.17,00:07:26.17,- Our bodies are starting toshow signs of trouble.
121,00:07:28.90,00:07:28.90,We're start to get sick.
122,00:07:30.37,00:07:30.37,"In the last couple, three days,we've all noticed that we're"
123,00:07:33.80,00:07:33.80,getting thinner.
124,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,It's startingto really show.
125,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,"- Man, you've losta ton of weight."
126,00:07:38.70,00:07:38.70,"- Yeah, I'd sayI've lost 40 pounds."
127,00:07:41.60,00:07:41.60,- 40 pounds?
128,00:07:43.03,00:07:43.03,Wow.
129,00:07:44.70,00:07:44.70,- Let's decide: do we want themush or do we want the gruel
130,00:07:46.97,00:07:46.97,this morning?
131,00:07:49.37,00:07:49.37,"We eat two small meals a day.I figure we're having, I don't"
132,00:07:52.23,00:07:52.23,"know, maybe a couple of hundredcalories, if that."
133,00:07:54.63,00:07:54.63,"And we're eating, I think, justenough to fool our bodies into"
134,00:07:56.90,00:07:56.90,thinking that we're gettingnutrition when we really aren't.
135,00:07:59.00,00:07:59.00,- It's ready.
136,00:08:01.53,00:08:01.53,- We have maize.
137,00:08:03.23,00:08:03.23,"It's cornmeal, basically, iswhat it is, so we eat that"
138,00:08:05.90,00:08:05.90,"either in like, just, mushed-upballs we boil in water."
139,00:08:09.13,00:08:09.13,"And then we snack on,like, kernels of corn."
140,00:08:12.33,00:08:12.33,"They don't really pop,but we kind of brown them"
141,00:08:14.27,00:08:14.27,and burn them.
142,00:08:15.60,00:08:15.60,- Those aretoo hard for me.
143,00:08:17.00,00:08:17.00,They just--they hurt my teeth.
144,00:08:18.20,00:08:18.20,- Mm-hmm.
145,00:08:19.37,00:08:19.37,And then we makea corn broth soup.
146,00:08:22.20,00:08:22.20,"- I'm eating it, even thoughI don't really want to."
147,00:08:24.40,00:08:24.40,It's just kind of a...
148,00:08:26.07,00:08:26.07,"just a watery gruelwith some, you know,"
149,00:08:28.40,00:08:28.40,some corn kernels in it.
150,00:08:32.40,00:08:32.40,- It's just so hardto get down because...
151,00:08:35.40,00:08:35.40,"it's like eating chalk twicea day, and then they"
152,00:08:38.30,00:08:38.30,put corn in it and thenyou've got chalk with some corn.
153,00:08:43.17,00:08:43.17,- (burps)
154,00:08:51.17,00:08:51.17,- Lex is worried.
155,00:08:53.07,00:08:53.07,- He's worried because he knowsI didn't like what he done.
156,00:08:56.33,00:08:56.33,"At the last Tribal Council,Lex cast a vote for Frank"
157,00:09:00.73,00:09:00.73,instead ofBrandon.
158,00:09:02.40,00:09:02.40,"We had an alliance, me him andEthan, and the alliance was we'd"
159,00:09:06.17,00:09:06.17,"vote together, and Lexjeopardized that alliance when"
160,00:09:11.83,00:09:11.83,he voted for Frank.
161,00:09:14.27,00:09:14.27,"- Before I cameinto this thing,"
162,00:09:16.27,00:09:16.27,I was totally100% anti-alliance.
163,00:09:17.87,00:09:17.87,I wanted to do it myselfand all by myself.
164,00:09:20.73,00:09:20.73,But I realized that'simpossible.
165,00:09:22.77,00:09:22.77,- You can't do it.
166,00:09:23.80,00:09:23.80,- You can't do it.
167,00:09:25.70,00:09:25.70,- I felt betrayed.
168,00:09:27.47,00:09:27.47,- I don't understand whyyou don't let Lex know.
169,00:09:29.70,00:09:29.70,"- Because when he made thatagreement with Brandon,"
170,00:09:31.87,00:09:31.87,he didn't come to me.
171,00:09:33.67,00:09:33.67,He didn'tcome to you either.
172,00:09:35.10,00:09:35.10,He did it on his own.
173,00:09:37.27,00:09:37.27,All he was worried aboutwas Lex.
174,00:09:40.17,00:09:40.17,"Now he's got to thinkingabout me and you, right?"
175,00:09:42.57,00:09:42.57,- Yeah.
176,00:09:43.60,00:09:43.60,- Okay.
177,00:09:45.07,00:09:45.07,"- I know Tom's true to me andKim, but probably take a little"
178,00:09:48.00,00:09:48.00,bit to get Lexback on his good side.
179,00:09:50.50,00:09:50.50,"- I don't know what'll happenin the future,"
180,00:09:53.17,00:09:53.17,"but from here on out, you know,I'll have question with Lex."
181,00:09:57.97,00:09:57.97,"- What's up, boys?"
182,00:09:59.23,00:09:59.23,- Hey.
183,00:09:59.23,00:09:59.23,- Hey.
184,00:10:11.87,00:10:11.87,- Mail?
185,00:10:12.93,00:10:12.93,- Can you guess the hint?
186,00:10:13.97,00:10:13.97,- That is sucha cool clue!
187,00:10:17.73,00:10:17.73,- Look here.
188,00:10:18.77,00:10:18.77,"- Look, look."
189,00:10:19.97,00:10:19.97,- What's the difference betweenthe pig and me?
190,00:10:21.10,00:10:21.10,- No boil on the pig.
191,00:10:22.13,00:10:22.13,- That's what I said!
192,00:10:23.50,00:10:23.50,"- ""You'll need all your strengthfor events down the road."
193,00:10:27.93,00:10:27.93,"Today is a great dayfor a good carbo load."""
194,00:10:31.60,00:10:31.60,- Pasta.
195,00:10:33.27,00:10:33.27,"- ""Proteins and sugars willgive you power to burn."
196,00:10:38.00,00:10:38.00,"So if you are clever,these gifts you may earn."""
197,00:10:53.47,00:10:53.47,"- (Probst) All right, guys."
198,00:10:55.27,00:10:55.27,"For today's reward challenge,we thought we'd give you a break"
199,00:10:58.23,00:10:58.23,on the challenge.
200,00:10:59.57,00:10:59.57,And just make it pure reward.
201,00:11:01.27,00:11:01.27,- Yay!

652,00:26:15.73,00:26:15.73,"When a baby boy is born,his destiny is already planned."
653,00:26:19.40,00:26:19.40,"To celebrate the birth,a goat is sacrificed."
654,00:26:22.90,00:26:22.90,The women of the tribe eatthe meat of the goat because
655,00:26:24.67,00:26:24.67,the women are the caretakersof the tribe.
656,00:26:26.77,00:26:26.77,"For the first four days afterthe birth, the mother drinks"
657,00:26:30.30,00:26:30.30,only the bloodof the goat.
658,00:26:32.10,00:26:32.10,"Around the ageof nine or ten,"
659,00:26:33.80,00:26:33.80,the boy has his firstrite of passage.
660,00:26:36.33,00:26:36.33,This is the removal of his twobottom middle teeth because if
661,00:26:39.17,00:26:39.17,he were to get sick and theyneeded to get food or water into
662,00:26:42.53,00:26:42.53,"his body, they use the gap fromthe two missing teeth as a way"
663,00:26:44.90,00:26:44.90,to do that.
664,00:26:46.27,00:26:46.27,It's also around this time thathe begins the practice of
665,00:26:48.53,00:26:48.53,piercing his ears.
666,00:26:49.70,00:26:49.70,This is the first cosmeticenhancement.
667,00:26:51.27,00:26:51.27,"His next rite of passage is acircumcision, and that begins"
668,00:26:54.80,00:26:54.80,with a journeyto find gum from a special tree.
669,00:26:59.07,00:26:59.07,"It could take him as long 45days, during which he can only"
670,00:27:02.07,00:27:02.07,subsist onthe generosity of others--
671,00:27:04.63,00:27:04.63,the food that he getsalong the way.
672,00:27:06.80,00:27:06.80,"Once he'scompleted his mission,"

678,00:27:22.73,00:27:22.73,But the most important aspectto a circumcision
679,00:27:24.77,00:27:24.77,is a warrior's reaction.
680,00:27:26.47,00:27:26.47,"If, during the circumcision,he flinches in any way,"
681,00:27:29.63,00:27:29.63,he and hisfamily are forever shamed.
682,00:27:31.53,00:27:31.53,"After eight years ofwarriorship,"
683,00:27:33.20,00:27:33.20,he's eligiblefor marriage.
684,00:27:35.23,00:27:35.23,Tribal custom demands that hecontinue to have kids until he
685,00:27:38.33,00:27:38.33,"has a boy, even if that meanstaking another wife and another."
686,00:27:41.73,00:27:41.73,The last step: Death.
687,00:27:43.40,00:27:43.40,"Once a warrior is close todeath, he is taken into the bush"
688,00:27:46.83,00:27:46.83,with another warriorand left to die.
689,00:27:49.90,00:27:49.90,"Once he dies, fellow warriorsshave their heads out of"
690,00:27:53.63,00:27:53.63,"respect, and his body isleft for the hyenas to eat."

813,00:34:49.93,00:34:49.93,- The guys have dominatedthe game.
814,00:34:52.93,00:34:52.93,They're saying who goes next.
815,00:34:54.43,00:34:54.43,"If nothing else, I'd like to seethe women get in there."
816,00:34:57.43,00:34:57.43,- Right.
817,00:34:59.23,00:34:59.23,"- Teresa doesn'twant to give up,"
818,00:35:00.47,00:35:00.47,and I don't wantto give up either.
819,00:35:01.83,00:35:01.83,"So, Teresa is, like, trying toscramble and figure out"
820,00:35:04.27,00:35:04.27,it there'sanything that we can do.
821,00:35:05.93,00:35:05.93,- Ethan's going to takethe whole thing.
822,00:35:08.93,00:35:08.93,He's great.
823,00:35:10.00,00:35:10.00,What can you saynegative about Ethan?
824,00:35:11.83,00:35:11.83,Nothing.
825,00:35:13.37,00:35:13.37,"- It's a shot in the dark, butif I can persuade Kim to vote"
826,00:35:16.13,00:35:16.13,"off Ethan, that would break upthat alliance."
827,00:35:18.97,00:35:18.97,- If Ethan's not here...
828,00:35:20.80,00:35:20.80,"- That would leave Kim,you, me and Frank."
829,00:35:23.13,00:35:23.13,"- You, me and Frank."
830,00:35:24.30,00:35:24.30,- And then you're going tostick by Frank.
831,00:35:25.93,00:35:25.93,- No.
832,00:35:27.40,00:35:27.40,"If you do this tonight, thenI'll pledge my loyalty to you."
833,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,"It could hurt me going to Kim,but Ethan's bonded with those"
834,00:35:35.10,00:35:35.10,"guys, and they're going to bestrong enough every time they"
835,00:35:37.03,00:35:37.03,vote to weed offone more of us.
836,00:35:38.97,00:35:38.97,"So it's kind of a risk, but atthis point, I feel like this is"
837,00:35:42.47,00:35:42.47,the only chance I've got.
838,00:35:44.43,00:35:44.43,- I was reallyshocked and pissed
839,00:35:46.43,00:35:46.43,"that they would even,you know...."
840,00:35:48.03,00:35:48.03,"- Well, they're cornered."
841,00:35:49.07,00:35:49.07,They haveno options.
842,00:35:51.10,00:35:51.10,"- Teresa approached me with theidea that Tommy, Lex and Ethan"
843,00:35:54.13,00:35:54.13,"really don't have any kind ofallegiance toward me,"
844,00:35:57.63,00:35:57.63,but I just can'tturn on Ethan at this point.
845,00:36:00.87,00:36:00.87,"So I'm going to have to tellTeresa that, and I'm not sure"
846,00:36:03.60,00:36:03.60,what the reaction isgoing to be to that.
847,00:36:05.67,00:36:05.67,"I just think, so really, that Ithink I might still be shooting"
848,00:36:07.63,00:36:07.63,"myself in the foot, even if Icould bring myself to it do it."
849,00:36:09.53,00:36:09.53,"- Okay, I understand."
850,00:36:11.43,00:36:11.43,I just appreciate you're tellingus so we can do different stuff.
851,00:36:16.43,00:36:16.43,"- I had an opportunity,obviously, to do something to"
852,00:36:19.10,00:36:19.10,"save them, and I didn'tdo that."
853,00:36:20.60,00:36:20.60,And now I'm afraidit's going to hurt me.
854,00:36:23.27,00:36:23.27,- This plan's not comingtogether.
855,00:36:25.33,00:36:25.33,- I know it's not.
856,00:36:27.67,00:36:27.67,"- So, it'll be an interestingTribal Council."
857,00:36:44.87,00:36:44.87,- (Probst) We'll now bring inthe members of our jury.
858,00:36:56.53,00:36:56.53,30 days.
859,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,Congratulations.
860,00:37:00.73,00:37:00.73,You made it a long ways.
861,00:37:01.93,00:37:01.93,Basically a monthout here on your own.
862,00:37:03.93,00:37:03.93,"Well, obviously, from this pointforward, the power shifts from"
863,00:37:09.07,00:37:09.07,the tribe members leftto the jury that is growing.
864,00:37:12.37,00:37:12.37,Your dilemma is obvious: How canyou vote somebody out of this
865,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,"game, take that million dollarsout of their hand and then ask"
866,00:37:18.53,00:37:18.53,them to put it in your handsby voting you most deserving?
867,00:37:20.83,00:37:20.83,"Teresa, what goes through yourhead now as you show up tonight"
868,00:37:23.57,00:37:23.57,and here's Brandonand Kelly?
869,00:37:24.87,00:37:24.87,"People you hada hand in voting out,"
870,00:37:26.73,00:37:26.73,you're going to needthem later.
871,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,"- For me, I guess it takes justthe way I play the game,"
872,00:37:32.03,00:37:32.03,"trying to be ashonest with everybody,"
873,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,"you know, that I could be,so at this point,"
874,00:37:36.60,00:37:36.60,it's just playing asfair as I can and hope that
875,00:37:38.43,00:37:38.43,"they'll respect, you know, mydecisions and how I played."
876,00:37:41.63,00:37:41.63,"- (Probst) Ethan, one of youseven is going tonight."
877,00:37:44.50,00:37:44.50,"Next Tribal Council, they'll besitting over there."
878,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,How can you vote them out
879,00:37:49.83,00:37:49.83,and ask them to votefor you at the end?
880,00:37:51.70,00:37:51.70,"- Well, you've just got to hopethat what you did before the"
881,00:37:55.93,00:37:55.93,"vote and how you treated peoplebefore the vote will, you know,"
882,00:38:00.83,00:38:00.83,put you in a good light.
883,00:38:02.57,00:38:02.57,"It is just a game,and if you get voted out,"
884,00:38:06.00,00:38:06.00,it's just astrategy.
885,00:38:07.30,00:38:07.30,You've got to look outfor yourself in the end.
886,00:38:09.80,00:38:09.80,"- (Probst) Lex, how close isthis game to turning ugly?"
887,00:38:12.77,00:38:12.77,- I think the game has alreadygone through some ugly times.
888,00:38:16.03,00:38:16.03,I think it's takena turn for the better.
889,00:38:18.20,00:38:18.20,It's probably going toget ugly again.
890,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,"But everyone here, whetherthey're, you know, sitting up"
891,00:38:22.77,00:38:22.77,"here or on the jury, realizes,though, that they came to play"
892,00:38:26.23,00:38:26.23,a game and to win.
893,00:38:27.63,00:38:27.63,"And you can do that withintegrity, but to come in here"
894,00:38:31.13,00:38:31.13,"thinking that it's never goingto be, you know,"
895,00:38:34.13,00:38:34.13,just a bones-to-bonescompetition is to be naive.
896,00:38:38.30,00:38:38.30,"- (Probst) Frank, do you feellike it's still the old Samburu"
897,00:38:40.83,00:38:40.83,and the old Boran when it comesdown to voting?
898,00:38:42.80,00:38:42.80,"- Not really because the gameis changing, you know."
899,00:38:45.43,00:38:45.43,I think those oldtribal names are gone.
900,00:38:47.50,00:38:47.50,"Our tribe had a new name,everyone belonged to it."
901,00:38:50.43,00:38:50.43,I think it's a strategy withinthe new tribe.
902,00:38:54.77,00:38:54.77,"- (Probst) Kim, do you feel thatyou might be safer because maybe"
903,00:38:57.63,00:38:57.63,"people don't see you as such aphysical threat,"
904,00:38:59.97,00:38:59.97,or are you worried thatmaybe you're too likable
905,00:39:01.97,00:39:01.97,"and, therefore, you'vegot to go?"
906,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,- I'm always worried.
907,00:39:04.43,00:39:04.43,I think I would be worried ifI were strong and I'm worried
908,00:39:07.10,00:39:07.10,because I'm not so strong.
909,00:39:08.77,00:39:08.77,It doesn't matterhow nice I am
910,00:39:10.23,00:39:10.23,or how weak I am orhow strong I am.
911,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37,"If I'm the logicalperson to go, I'm going."
912,00:39:14.97,00:39:14.97,"- All right, it's timeto vote."
913,00:39:16.90,00:39:16.90,Lex is the onlyone you can't vote for.
914,00:39:18.73,00:39:18.73,Everybody elseis fair game.
915,00:39:19.80,00:39:19.80,"Kim, you're up first."
916,00:39:30.30,00:39:30.30,"- I've enjoyed you as a person,but we have to vote somebody off"
917,00:39:32.87,00:39:32.87,and you're mynext logical choice.
918,00:39:35.03,00:39:35.03,"I'll miss you, though."
919,00:39:51.90,00:39:51.90,- It's been good for me to bearound someone so different from
920,00:39:54.40,00:39:54.40,myself and learn from you.
921,00:39:55.83,00:39:55.83,I'm glad that we actually got tospend some time together.
922,00:40:18.87,00:40:18.87,- This is nota vote of betrayal.
923,00:40:21.47,00:40:21.47,This is a voteof strategy.
924,00:40:23.33,00:40:23.33,"Frank, thank you so muchfor the friendship."
925,00:40:40.83,00:40:40.83,- I'll go tally the votes.
926,00:41:06.87,00:41:06.87,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
927,00:41:08.47,00:41:08.47,The person will be asked
928,00:41:09.83,00:41:09.83,to leave the Tribal Councilarea immediately.
929,00:41:11.23,00:41:11.23,I'll read the votes.
930,00:41:14.63,00:41:14.63,First vote: Frank.

933,00:41:36.27,00:41:36.27,Frank.
934,00:41:37.27,00:41:37.27,"Three votes Frank,one vote Kim."
935,00:41:46.53,00:41:46.53,Frank.
936,00:41:47.90,00:41:47.90,"That's enough, Frank."
937,00:41:48.97,00:41:48.97,You need to bring meyour torch.
938,00:41:56.00,00:41:56.00,"Frank, the tribehas spoken."
939,00:42:05.07,00:42:05.07,It's time for you to go.
940,00:42:15.37,00:42:15.37,You guys can headback to camp.
