293,00:17:21.73,00:17:21.73,IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE IN A TREE.

301,00:18:07.33,00:18:07.33,I DID IT. I HAVE A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
302,00:18:10.30,00:18:10.30,THIS IS AMAZING. I THINK IF I WERE ON THE BLUE OR

1137,01:13:16.93,01:13:16.93,IN THE POWER POSITION. WHAT IF WE JUST GET A MAJORITY
1138,01:13:21.40,01:13:21.40,"APART FROM THEM TWO, VOTE OFF SHIRIN AND THEN TAKE MAX IN"
1139,01:13:24.97,01:13:24.97,BECAUSE WE NEED HIM FOR CHALLENGES?

1147,01:13:58.00,01:13:58.00,COLLAR TRIBE IN THE MIDDLE. WHITE COLLAR WAS MOST AGGRESSIVE
1148,01:14:01.37,01:14:01.37,ABOUT PURSUING KELLY AT THAT CRUCIAL SWING VOTE.
1149,01:14:04.57,01:14:04.57,SHIRIN WAS DOING A LOT OF HARD WORK UP FRONT.
1150,01:14:07.47,01:14:07.47,AND I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SECURE HER.
1151,01:14:11.67,01:14:11.67,>> OKAY. YOU GOT IT.
1152,01:14:14.40,01:14:14.40,SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. >> WE'RE GOOD.

1164,01:14:49.70,01:14:49.70,DOES IT IMPACT ME ALL THAT MUCH? NOT REALLY.
1165,01:14:56.93,01:14:56.93,>> KELLY WAS THERE AMPS WE HASHED IT OUT WITH HER.

1169,01:15:13.63,01:15:13.63,I CAN TAKE THAT POWER AWAY FROM KELLY AND BE FOUR STRONG WITH
1170,01:15:17.30,01:15:17.30,THE NO COLLARS AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.
1171,01:15:20.67,01:15:20.67,SO I THINK A FABULOUS BLIND SIDE MAY BE IN THE MAKING.
1172,01:15:30.63,01:15:30.63,>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? ANYTHING?

1180,01:16:09.07,01:16:09.07,EASIER. >> I'M EXCITED BECAUSE IT SOUNDS
1181,01:16:11.00,01:16:11.00,LIKE EVERYONE HATES MOST OF THE WHITE COLLARS.
1182,01:16:12.77,01:16:12.77,NO ONE CAN STAND MAX. NO ONE CAN STAND SHIRIN.
1183,01:16:16.50,01:16:16.50,AND WE HAVE CAROLYN. SO WE HAVE THE NUMBERS.
1184,01:16:19.30,01:16:19.30,WE'LL CONTROL THE GAME. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE WITH US.

1189,01:16:47.10,01:16:47.10,I DON'T THINK SHE'S STOPPED TALKING SINCE WE GOT HERE.
1190,01:16:49.30,01:16:49.30,>> SHE WILL NEVER VOTE OUT MAX. THEY'RE LIKE THIS.
1191,01:16:53.57,01:16:53.57,>> SO DO YOU FEEL TOTALLY ON THE OUTS WITH THEM?
1192,01:16:56.73,01:16:56.73,>> TOTALLY. THEY'RE SCHEMING.
