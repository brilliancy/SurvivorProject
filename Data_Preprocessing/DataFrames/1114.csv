2,00:00:06.04,00:00:06.04,"among the ruins of an ancient civilization, 16 Americans began"
3,00:00:10.54,00:00:10.54,the adventure of a lifetime. Their first surprise came in the
4,00:00:15.96,00:00:15.96,"form of two previous castaways. Bobby Jon and Stephenie, the"
5,00:00:21.12,00:00:21.12,last remaining members of their tribe in Palau return to compete
6,00:00:25.17,00:00:25.17,"one more time. >> What's up, guys?"
7,00:00:29.25,00:00:29.25,>> PROBST: Bobby Jon joined Nakum and Stephenie joined
8,00:00:31.25,00:00:31.25,Yaxha. >> My main fear coming into the
9,00:00:35.33,00:00:35.33,game was maybe they just want to get rid of me.
10,00:00:38.12,00:00:38.12,>> PROBST: Survivors ready. Go.
11,00:00:40.46,00:00:40.46,"Immediately they faced their first reward challenge, an 11-"
12,00:00:43.79,00:00:43.79,mile race through the jungles of Guatemala.
13,00:00:47.29,00:00:47.29,It lasted through the night... >> Wait please.
14,00:00:51.42,00:00:51.42,>> PROBST: And into the next day.
15,00:00:53.96,00:00:53.96,">> We need to, like, get right on their asses."
16,00:00:56.92,00:00:56.92,>> PROBST: Though both tribes pushed themselves to the
17,00:00:59.25,00:00:59.25,"limit... >> Oh, yeah!"
18,00:01:02.08,00:01:02.08,>> PROBST: ...it was Nakum that crossed the finish line first
19,00:01:05.04,00:01:05.04,winning flint and the better tribe camp.
20,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50,But their victory came at a high price.
21,00:01:13.04,00:01:13.04,>> How you doing? >> Huh?
22,00:01:14.58,00:01:14.58,>> His eyes are rolling back. Bobby Jon?
23,00:01:17.21,00:01:17.21,">> These big strong guys, strong as ox's and they are all down."
24,00:01:21.92,00:01:21.92,>> PROBST: At the first immunity challenge the Yaxha tribe made a
25,00:01:24.83,00:01:24.83,comeback... Yaxha wins immunity!
26,00:01:28.12,00:01:28.12,...sending Nakum to their first Tribal Council where
27,00:01:31.21,00:01:31.21,"Jim, the most ailing of the men, was voted out."
28,00:01:36.38,00:01:36.38,The tribes continued to fight hard at the challenges.
29,00:01:39.50,00:01:39.50,Temperature update: 114 degrees. And Yaxha's comeback proved
30,00:01:45.08,00:01:45.08,short-lived when they lost Morgan and Brianna in back-to-
31,00:01:48.17,00:01:48.17,"back Tribal Councils. On day 10, the tribes were"
32,00:01:52.08,00:01:52.08,switched. Drop your buffs.
33,00:01:54.21,00:01:54.21,">> Oh, my god. >> PROBST: Gary, Brian and Amy"
34,00:01:57.67,00:01:57.67,found themselves outnumbered three to four on the new Yaxha
35,00:02:01.00,00:02:01.00,tribe. >> We are decimated here.
36,00:02:03.17,00:02:03.17,"Decimated. >> PROBST: And at Nakum,"
37,00:02:05.42,00:02:05.42,Stephenie and Jamie mixed things up when they immediately bonded
38,00:02:08.08,00:02:08.08,with Judd. >> You know when you have a
39,00:02:11.12,00:02:11.12,"natural click. >> Yeah, you can you feel it."
40,00:02:14.38,00:02:14.38,">> Go, go, go! >> PROBST: Amy is down!"
41,00:02:19.08,00:02:19.08,The rivalry between the tribes intensified.
42,00:02:23.08,00:02:23.08,And intertribal conflicts boiled over.
43,00:02:27.38,00:02:27.38,">> She comes to camp; ""You have ADD. Do you know that?"""
44,00:02:30.33,00:02:30.33,When you first meet somebody is that something nice to say?
45,00:02:32.92,00:02:32.92,>> This is what it's like to try to talk to him.
46,00:02:35.71,00:02:35.71,>> You should just shut up. >> PROBST: Nakum lost Brooke and
47,00:02:38.75,00:02:38.75,"Margaret. And Yaxha lost Blake, Brian and"
48,00:02:44.38,00:02:44.38,"Amy. On night 18, the tribes merged."
49,00:02:49.25,00:02:49.25,">> We have new buffs for you. >> Oh, my gosh."
50,00:02:51.96,00:02:51.96,">> Merge, baby, merge. >> PROBST: And tree mail brought"
51,00:02:54.75,00:02:54.75,news of a small immunity idol hidden in the jungle.
52,00:02:58.17,00:02:58.17,>> There's an immunity idol about this big in a
53,00:03:01.92,00:03:01.92,jungle that's this big. >> PROBST: At the first
54,00:03:06.12,00:03:06.12,"individual immunity challenge, a tribe divide was exposed when"
55,00:03:08.46,00:03:08.46,some members of the former Nakum tribe chose to sit out and feast
56,00:03:11.79,00:03:11.79,while the former Yaxha's all played for their lives.
57,00:03:16.21,00:03:16.21,>> Brianna and Bobby Jon know they have a chance of going home
58,00:03:18.71,00:03:18.71,tonight. >> I thought we were one tribe.
59,00:03:20.50,00:03:20.50,">> You know it's not one tribe, so why are you saying that right"
60,00:03:22.58,00:03:22.58,now? >> Because I can and I will and
61,00:03:24.50,00:03:24.50,I want to. >> PROBST: The tension between
62,00:03:27.00,00:03:27.00,the two former tribes didn't ease at Tribal Council.
63,00:03:31.29,00:03:31.29,">> Somebody is sitting there saying ""Go, Judd, Whoo-woo!"""
64,00:03:33.83,00:03:33.83,"I'm just, like, that's just no class."
65,00:03:36.21,00:03:36.21,>> He can think what he wants to think.
66,00:03:38.38,00:03:38.38,"I am the bigger man. >> Man, just shut up, dude. God."
67,00:03:41.17,00:03:41.17,">> PROBST: Before we get to the vote, an immunity idol was"
68,00:03:43.75,00:03:43.75,"hidden at your camp. If anybody has found that, now"
69,00:03:46.62,00:03:46.62,is the time to present it. >> PROBST: When the hidden idol
70,00:03:49.67,00:03:49.67,"didn't surface, Brandon was the first member of the outnumbered"
71,00:03:52.96,00:03:52.96,Yaxha's to get the boot. Things were not looking good for
72,00:03:57.83,00:03:57.83,"Danni, Gary or Bobby Jon. Jamie doesn't knock Judd out."
73,00:04:05.88,00:04:05.88,When Judd won a clue to the location of the hidden immunity
74,00:04:09.04,00:04:09.04,idol he shared it with Stephenie.
75,00:04:11.08,00:04:11.08,">> ""It's not buried or concealed nor directly on the ground."""
76,00:04:14.62,00:04:14.62,">> That'd be, like, in a tree. >> PROBST: Then Judd lied to the"
77,00:04:18.12,00:04:18.12,rest of his tribe. >> It is totally on the ground.
78,00:04:21.71,00:04:21.71,>> PROBST: Gary was suspicious when he caught Judd looking for
79,00:04:24.21,00:04:24.21,"the idol in the trees. >> If it's on the ground, I"
80,00:04:26.54,00:04:26.54,wonder why he is looking in the trees.
81,00:04:29.00,00:04:29.00,No doubt in my mind that Judd is lying.
82,00:04:31.12,00:04:31.12,>> PROBST: At Tribal Council Gary stunned his tribe when he
83,00:04:33.42,00:04:33.42,revealed that he found the hidden immunity idol.
84,00:04:35.79,00:04:35.79,">> Oh, my God. Gary. >> Oh, man."
85,00:04:38.75,00:04:38.75,>> PROBST: Gary was safe for one more night and Bobby Jon became
86,00:04:41.46,00:04:41.46,"the first member of the jury. Bobby Jon, the tribe has spoken."
87,00:04:46.54,00:04:46.54,>> Thank you very much. I enjoyed it.
88,00:04:48.21,00:04:48.21,">> PROBST: By day 27, Jamie's paranoia had begun to wear on"
89,00:04:51.92,00:04:51.92,"the members of his alliance. >> He's like, so you're sticking"
90,00:05:01.58,00:05:01.58,"with the six, right? And I'm, like, ""Jamie, you're"
91,00:05:03.96,00:05:03.96,"driving me insane."" >> PROBST: The 11th person voted"
92,00:05:07.08,00:05:07.08,out of Survivor: Guatemala. His tribe assured him he was
93,00:05:10.04,00:05:10.04,safe... The tribe has spoken.
94,00:05:12.08,00:05:12.08,...Jamie was voted out. >> Blind-sided... Nice!
95,00:05:15.83,00:05:15.83,"Now, that's how you vote somebody out."
96,00:05:19.04,00:05:19.04,>> PROBST: Gary and Rafe both heading back with their last
97,00:05:21.46,00:05:21.46,flag. Gary continued to give it his
98,00:05:23.88,00:05:23.88,"all, but when Rafe won his third immunity challenge..."
99,00:05:27.46,00:05:27.46,Once again Rafe wins immunity! ...Gary attempted to stir things
100,00:05:33.46,00:05:33.46,up when he exposed Judd's lie at Tribal Council.
101,00:05:36.54,00:05:36.54,">> Way back when he got the clue about the idol, he goes, ""Okay,"
102,00:05:39.17,00:05:39.17,"I will tell you it is on the ground."""
103,00:05:42.21,00:05:42.21,I follow him out in the woods next day and he is looking in
104,00:05:44.88,00:05:44.88,all the trees. And the idol was in the tree.
105,00:05:47.54,00:05:47.54,>> Okay. I lied about the damn idol. Okay.
106,00:05:50.12,00:05:50.12,">> PROBST: 12th person outted of Survivor: Guatemala, Gary."
107,00:05:53.42,00:05:53.42,But all of Gary's game playing couldn't save him and he was
108,00:05:56.75,00:05:56.75,voted out. Danni was the last remaining
109,00:06:03.04,00:06:03.04,member of the former Yaxha tribe and Lydia was on the outs with
110,00:06:06.75,00:06:06.75,her former alliance. The odds against them both were
111,00:06:09.58,00:06:09.58,almost insurmountable. >> I've got to look at who is in
112,00:06:12.08,00:06:12.08,control of the game and play up to it.
113,00:06:14.88,00:06:14.88,Because I'm not going to go home.
114,00:06:18.42,00:06:18.42,">> PROBST: At the auction, the loved ones of the survivors were"
115,00:06:21.08,00:06:21.08,revealed and Judd bought an overnight stay with his wife
116,00:06:24.17,00:06:24.17,Kristen. That night at camp Stephenie
117,00:06:29.21,00:06:29.21,assured Kristen that she and Judd were tight to the end.
118,00:06:40.62,00:06:40.62,>> PROBST: But Stephenie didn't know Danni and Rafe were
119,00:06:43.46,00:06:43.46,conspiring against Judd. >> We just need to catch Judd
120,00:06:47.04,00:06:47.04,with some kind of lie. You can't trust a person like
121,00:06:50.25,00:06:50.25,Judd. But you can trust that you can't
122,00:06:52.50,00:06:52.50,trust them. >> PROBST: Just when she needed
123,00:06:55.92,00:06:55.92,"it the most, Danni won immunity. Steph is out."
124,00:06:59.42,00:06:59.42,Danni wins immunity. Well played.
125,00:07:03.25,00:07:03.25,Then she pulled out all the stops and worked on turning
126,00:07:06.04,00:07:06.04,Stephenie against Judd as well. >> I'd like to believe Judd but
127,00:07:16.83,00:07:16.83,he's already been caught in quite a few lies and Danni
128,00:07:21.00,00:07:21.00,really hasn't lied at all. >> PROBST: Judd never saw it
129,00:07:24.17,00:07:24.17,coming. Stephenie joined forces with
130,00:07:26.38,00:07:26.38,"Danni, Rafe and Lydia and voted him out."
131,00:07:29.42,00:07:29.42,>> I hope you guys get bit by a freakin' crocodile.
132,00:07:32.88,00:07:32.88,Scum bags. >> PROBST: As it all came down
133,00:07:37.33,00:07:37.33,"to the wire, Rafe and Danni made a promise to the end."
134,00:07:50.38,00:07:50.38,>> Danni's promised me she would take me to the Final Two.
135,00:07:52.83,00:07:52.83,"That's a huge degree of security at the end of a crazy, crazy"
136,00:07:57.25,00:07:57.25,game. >> PROBST: At the reward
137,00:07:59.08,00:07:59.08,challenge Cindy won a new car. Cindy wins reward.
138,00:08:03.71,00:08:03.71,But she was put on the spot when she was given a difficult
139,00:08:06.67,00:08:06.67,choice. >> PROBST: In ten seasons of
140,00:08:08.58,00:08:08.58,"Survivor, the person who won the car reward has never, ever"
141,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,won the game. I will give you a chance to get
142,00:08:15.92,00:08:15.92,rid of the curse. You can give up your car and
143,00:08:19.21,00:08:19.21,"instead, each of the other four will get a Pontiac Torrent."
144,00:08:24.33,00:08:24.33,Cindy chose to keep the car. >> I would love to give everyone
145,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,"a car, but I am here to beat the odds and so far I have."
146,00:08:32.29,00:08:32.29,>> PROBST: Rafe was angry with Cindy's decision and lobbied to
147,00:08:35.04,00:08:35.04,have her voted out. >> You do?
148,00:08:44.75,00:08:44.75,>> PROBST: But Stephenie was unsure.
149,00:08:47.00,00:08:47.00,">> I vote off Cindy, I won't get Jamie's, Judd's or Cindy's."
150,00:08:50.33,00:08:50.33,I told him I felt bad because we already turned on Judd and Cindy
151,00:08:53.04,00:08:53.04,is in our alliance and now we're going to be turning on Cindy and
152,00:08:56.17,00:08:56.17,this might be another vote I could lose when it comes time
153,00:08:58.88,00:08:58.88,for the jury. >> PROBST: At the immunity
154,00:09:00.46,00:09:00.46,challenge... Steph wins immunity.
155,00:09:03.62,00:09:03.62,...Steph secured herself a spot in the Final Four.
156,00:09:06.96,00:09:06.96,>> Finally I won something! >> PROBST: And at Tribal Council
157,00:09:11.50,00:09:11.50,she risked alienating another member of the jury when she
158,00:09:14.04,00:09:14.04,sided with Rafe and helped vote Cindy out.
159,00:09:16.58,00:09:16.58,>> I'll think about you guys when I will see the stars
160,00:09:19.08,00:09:19.08,through the sun roof of my new car.
161,00:09:21.62,00:09:21.62,">> PROBST: Cindy, the tribe has spoken."
162,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,"Now, only four remain. Rafe, Danni, Lydia and"
163,00:09:31.00,00:09:31.00,Stephenie. Tonight they will compete in
164,00:09:33.08,00:09:33.08,their final immunity challenges. Two will go on to face the jury.
165,00:09:37.17,00:09:37.17,One will outlast all the rest and become the sole survivor.
166,00:09:44.67,00:09:44.67,"( theme song playing ) >> Good morning, Lydia."
167,00:11:06.96,00:11:06.96,">> I woke up with a smile on my face, just like I predicted."
168,00:11:09.62,00:11:09.62,Waking up this morning and realizing I was one of the Final
169,00:11:12.88,00:11:12.88,Four was one of the greatest feelings.
170,00:11:17.00,00:11:17.00,I always felt like I was the odd man out.
171,00:11:19.71,00:11:19.71,Why am I here? Is it my destiny?
172,00:11:22.67,00:11:22.67,"Somebody is watching over me. >> Thanks, Lydia."
173,00:11:25.92,00:11:25.92,">> Okay. This is a nice batch, too."
174,00:11:29.88,00:11:29.88,">> This morning around camp, I was trying to be relaxed, but I"
175,00:11:32.17,00:11:32.17,was a total wreck. I am a huge Kansas Jayhawk
176,00:11:35.58,00:11:35.58,basketball fan. In the last four years we have
177,00:11:38.17,00:11:38.17,gone to the Final Four twice and haven't brought back the
178,00:11:41.67,00:11:41.67,championship. So I feel like all this pressure
179,00:11:44.08,00:11:44.08,on me to go back home and bring home a championship.
180,00:11:48.29,00:11:48.29,">> Happy breakfast, Final Four. Cheers to the Final Four."
181,00:11:51.67,00:11:51.67,>> Congratulations. >> It feels really good to be
182,00:11:55.75,00:11:55.75,sitting here proud of every decision I made in the game so
183,00:11:59.17,00:11:59.17,"far, and like happy with the people I am here with in the"
184,00:12:02.38,00:12:02.38,Final Four. It is really nice.
185,00:12:10.12,00:12:10.12,">> Oh, my God. This is a good one."
186,00:12:13.83,00:12:13.83,"I got the... out of the jar. \xe2\x99\xaa Oh, la, la... \xe2\x99\xaa"
187,00:12:17.96,00:12:17.96,>> What is it? This morning we got this tree
188,00:12:21.04,00:12:21.04,mail and Lydia comes running up the hill screaming and yelling
189,00:12:24.17,00:12:24.17,"in weird sounds like it's a basket of goodies or something,"
190,00:12:26.29,00:12:26.29,"you know, for being in the Final Four."
191,00:12:28.96,00:12:28.96,">> What is it? >> It better be good, Lydia?"
192,00:12:32.62,00:12:32.62,">> It is. ""37 days living amongst over"
193,00:12:37.33,00:12:37.33,"2,000 years of history, these ancestral grounds are still"
194,00:12:42.33,00:12:42.33,"considered sacred. These temples, still altars, as"
195,00:12:45.92,00:12:45.92,"you will soon see, the spirit and culture of the Maya is still"
196,00:12:49.83,00:12:49.83,alive today... and you are now part this history.
197,00:12:53.08,00:12:53.08,"Embrace it. Enjoy it. Appreciate it."""
198,00:12:56.25,00:12:56.25,"We're gonna celebrate. >> Wait, but does it say"
199,00:12:59.38,00:12:59.38,"celebrate anywhere? >> No, but you see, this is what"
200,00:13:02.67,00:13:02.67,I gathered from all of this. I am excited.
201,00:13:07.42,00:13:07.42,"That's right. >> Lydia, I thought you were"
202,00:13:09.58,00:13:09.58,bringing up a freakin' seven- course feast.
203,00:13:11.92,00:13:11.92,>> No. You guys don't understand my language?
204,00:13:14.88,00:13:14.88,Do you not comprehend what we are saying here?
205,00:13:17.25,00:13:17.25,"Look, I have... I have this vision that we are going to go."
206,00:13:23.25,00:13:23.25,>> Who decided to keep her around?
207,00:13:25.92,00:13:25.92,>> I was so certain about a big feast and everything.
208,00:13:28.58,00:13:28.58,"But, perhaps, the Mayan people might come into our camp and do"
209,00:13:34.33,00:13:34.33,some kind of ritual. >> Oh.
210,00:13:47.79,00:13:47.79,">> Oh, my God. Hi. >> This family of Mayans come"
211,00:13:54.83,00:13:54.83,walking up to camp. There were two women and three
212,00:13:57.08,00:13:57.08,men. And they came with these big
213,00:14:00.54,00:14:00.54,baskets and incense burning. >> Hello. Hi. How are you?
214,00:14:07.17,00:14:07.17,>> None of them spoke any English.
215,00:14:08.92,00:14:08.92,And they pretty much went over here in front of the biggest
216,00:14:12.21,00:14:12.21,pyramid we have and kind of made a circle with sugar and they lit
217,00:14:15.92,00:14:15.92,all these candles and all this incense.
218,00:14:18.42,00:14:18.42,There was rosemary and poured a bottle of honey on the fire.
219,00:14:21.79,00:14:21.79,"And it was like hello, we want the honey."
220,00:14:24.50,00:14:24.50,">> ( speaking native language ) >> The oldest gentleman, I"
221,00:14:29.67,00:14:29.67,"believe it was the father, he was chanting the whole time,"
222,00:14:32.25,00:14:32.25,"chanting a prayer in each direction that you, like, bless"
223,00:14:35.25,00:14:35.25,yourself. When they want to give thanks to
224,00:14:38.21,00:14:38.21,"their ancestors, I guess that's what they do."
225,00:14:42.33,00:14:42.33,They had this chicken that I thought was dead but was alive.
226,00:14:46.04,00:14:46.04,"I was, like, oh, are we going to get to eat the chicken?"
227,00:14:48.75,00:14:48.75,>> ( speaking native language ) >> As soon as the chicken came
228,00:14:58.08,00:14:58.08,"out, Steph was like, oh, will they kill it?"
229,00:15:01.00,00:15:01.00,"It was like, I really think this is a sacrifice we are watching."
230,00:15:04.71,00:15:04.71,>> ( speaking native language ) >> ( chicken clucking )
231,00:15:12.17,00:15:12.17,>> They pulled off the chicken's head and threw it in the fire.
232,00:15:16.38,00:15:16.38,"And Steph was like, ""did they kill it, Rafe?"""
233,00:15:18.62,00:15:18.62,I was like they ripped the chicken's head off and threw it
234,00:15:21.79,00:15:21.79,in the fire. It is a dead chicken.
235,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,I just got so much out of watching the ritual and just
236,00:15:32.50,00:15:32.50,hearing them speak Mayan. >> Gracias.
237,00:15:48.50,00:15:48.50,"Being of Latin heritage and Hispanic background myself, it"
238,00:15:53.33,00:15:53.33,"made me have a kinship, you know, a place in my heart what"
239,00:15:57.21,00:15:57.21,they did out here. They also offered us the most
240,00:16:04.00,00:16:04.00,delicious tamales. >> Gracias.
241,00:16:07.12,00:16:07.12,>> Gracias. >> Stephenie had her eyes on
242,00:16:09.96,00:16:09.96,"that yard bird. She was like ask them, ask them,"
243,00:16:13.25,00:16:13.25,"Lydia, if we can eat the bird. >> Okay. ( Speaking Spanish )"
244,00:16:22.92,00:16:22.92,>> No. >> No.
245,00:16:26.12,00:16:26.12,"He says, ""Oh, no, this is an offering to the Mayan gods."
246,00:16:29.62,00:16:29.62,"This is something that we're not going to eat."""
247,00:16:32.25,00:16:32.25,">> It is the way of saying thank you to the earth, thank you to"
248,00:16:35.33,00:16:35.33,"the sky, thank you to the water and thank you to the ancestors"
249,00:16:38.17,00:16:38.17,who built this temple. >> ( speaking Spanish )
250,00:16:44.25,00:16:44.25,>> I have been waiting to have a cultural experience here the
251,00:16:47.17,00:16:47.17,"whole time, because... To me, you don't understand"
252,00:16:50.12,00:16:50.12,where you are until you have met and experienced the people.
253,00:17:05.12,00:17:05.12,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. First things first."
254,00:17:13.96,00:17:13.96,"Steph, give it up. You didn't have it very long,"
255,00:17:18.67,00:17:18.67,but it served its purpose. Got you to the Final Four.
256,00:17:22.58,00:17:22.58,"Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
257,00:17:25.25,00:17:25.25,Today's immunity challenge is the most complex Survivor-maze
258,00:17:28.83,00:17:28.83,ever constructed. It is based on a very famous
259,00:17:32.00,00:17:32.00,"Maya deity, the Seven Macaw, which was a monstrous bird that"
260,00:17:36.08,00:17:36.08,"ruled the land at one time. On my ""go"" the four of you will"
261,00:17:39.79,00:17:39.79,race into the maze to collect your assigned color of puzzle
262,00:17:43.12,00:17:43.12,pieces. There are six stations but there
263,00:17:45.42,00:17:45.42,are eight pieces. Some pieces come in pairs.
264,00:17:49.25,00:17:49.25,Every time you find a piece make your way across the center of
265,00:17:53.21,00:17:53.21,"the course, across the pontoons, up the ladder and put the piece"
266,00:17:56.50,00:17:56.50,"in your puzzle board. To get back into the maze, cross"
267,00:17:59.71,00:17:59.71,a rope bridge and go down another ladder.
268,00:18:02.29,00:18:02.29,Once you have collected all eight pieces you must solve the
269,00:18:05.33,00:18:05.33,"puzzle to reveal one of three Mayan images: the jaguar, the"
270,00:18:10.58,00:18:10.58,croc or the monkey. The first person to solve it
271,00:18:13.92,00:18:13.92,"correctly, immunity around their neck and guaranteed spot in the"
272,00:18:17.21,00:18:17.21,Final Three. Worth playing for?
273,00:18:19.08,00:18:19.08,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: I hope so.
274,00:18:20.67,00:18:20.67,We'll get started. Let's go.
275,00:18:26.67,00:18:26.67,Here we go for immunity and a spot in the Final Three.
276,00:18:30.58,00:18:30.58,Survivors ready? Go!
277,00:18:35.04,00:18:35.04,This is a huge maze. A lot of area to cover.
278,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17,A lot of dummy stations. Only a few that contain puzzle
279,00:18:42.25,00:18:42.25,"pieces. When you find a piece, it is up"
280,00:18:45.71,00:18:45.71,to you if you are loud about sharing it or quiet to conceal
281,00:18:49.38,00:18:49.38,it. Stephenie coming back with her
282,00:18:53.62,00:18:53.62,first pair. Lydia right behind.
283,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,Danni has a pair. Steph finds the center of the
284,00:19:02.71,00:19:02.71,course. Lydia... crossing the pontoon.
285,00:19:06.75,00:19:06.75,Steph first on the board. Danni's found the pontoon.

289,00:19:27.62,00:19:27.62,Lydia has another piece. She is trying to find her way

292,00:19:47.00,00:19:47.00,Everybody now with three pieces. Four more stations left.
293,00:19:53.25,00:19:53.25,You have only just begun. Already everybody is winded.
294,00:20:08.62,00:20:08.62,Rafe across the pontoons with his fourth puzzle piece.
295,00:20:12.25,00:20:12.25,Steph hustling back. Still very tight.

299,00:20:30.29,00:20:30.29,You are worn out. You have to dig deep if you want
300,00:20:33.12,00:20:33.12,to win this. Rafe back with another puzzle
301,00:20:40.04,00:20:40.04,piece. Steph leaps across the pontoons
302,00:20:44.58,00:20:44.58,and makes up a lot of ground. Rafe with his fifth piece.
303,00:20:49.21,00:20:49.21,Steph with her fifth piece. They are neck and neck.

312,00:21:30.46,00:21:30.46,Steph and Rafe have one station left each.
313,00:21:33.92,00:21:33.92,Danni got to keep moving if she wants to be in this.
314,00:21:39.12,00:21:39.12,Danni has a piece. Lydia tailing her.
315,00:21:41.58,00:21:41.58,Lydia will have a piece now. Danni coming back with her 6th

322,00:22:20.62,00:22:20.62,putting the puzzle together. Danni trying to stay in it.
323,00:22:24.04,00:22:24.04,Got to find her last station. You are trying to form one of
324,00:22:28.42,00:22:28.42,"three images. The croc, the monkey or the"
325,00:22:32.54,00:22:32.54,jaguar. Danni has her last station and
326,00:22:35.33,00:22:35.33,has to get back here to work on the puzzle.
327,00:22:37.71,00:22:37.71,Lydia still searching for her last piece.
328,00:22:40.08,00:22:40.08,Danni has her last pair. She's got to get back up here.
329,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,Danni racing across the pontoons.

331,00:22:55.50,00:22:55.50,Danni now in it. First one to solve the puzzle

334,00:23:06.79,00:23:06.79,Steph working. Patience is key.
335,00:23:10.62,00:23:10.62,Do not panic. Think.
336,00:23:20.29,00:23:20.29,">> Okay, Jeff. >> PROBST: Rafe thinks he has"
337,00:23:23.54,00:23:23.54,it. Rafe has it.
338,00:23:28.58,00:23:28.58,"Rafe wins immunity. >> Good job, Rafe."
339,00:23:35.92,00:23:35.92,">> Good job, Rafe. >> Last piece."
340,00:23:39.50,00:23:39.50,">> PROBST: Rafe, come on over. Rafe, got to feel good to have"
341,00:23:43.62,00:23:43.62,this again. >> Yeah. Especially at this
342,00:23:46.08,00:23:46.08,stage. >> PROBST: Rafe safe for
343,00:23:48.29,00:23:48.29,"tonight's vote. Lydia, Steph, Danni, 37 days."
344,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,For one of you that will be it. Somebody going home tonight.
345,00:23:55.12,00:23:55.12,You have the afternoon to figure out who it will be.
346,00:23:57.46,00:23:57.46,Head on back to camp. >> It was.
347,00:24:17.50,00:24:17.50,That was real serious. >> It's weird to have the
348,00:24:24.04,00:24:24.04,immunity necklace and know I am going to the Final Three.
349,00:24:26.67,00:24:26.67,">> You did great, Rafe. >> Thank you."
350,00:24:28.62,00:24:28.62,It is incredible. It is like I really believe I
351,00:24:31.21,00:24:31.21,can get to the end of this game and maybe win it.
352,00:24:41.58,00:24:41.58,>> So am I. I am not freakin' giving in.
353,00:24:44.38,00:24:44.38,Basically my strategy consists of me getting to the Final
354,00:24:47.17,00:24:47.17,"Two with Rafe, because I feel Rafe's the only person I have a"
355,00:24:50.62,00:24:50.62,"chance to win the $1 million against, because we have double"
356,00:24:53.79,00:24:53.79,crossed the same people; we played a very similar game.
357,00:24:56.04,00:24:56.04,We never lied to each other. >> Not once this whole game.
358,00:25:00.00,00:25:00.00,">> I know. From a strategic standpoint, if"
359,00:25:03.42,00:25:03.42,"we want to guarantee ourselves a Final Two spot, most likely we"
360,00:25:08.08,00:25:08.08,"should take Lydia. In a Final Three challenge,"
361,00:25:11.92,00:25:11.92,guaranteed Lydia is not going to win.
362,00:25:14.29,00:25:14.29,>> I don't see us having a problem.
363,00:25:16.67,00:25:16.67,">> I don't either. >> Steph is like, the two of us"
364,00:25:19.71,00:25:19.71,need to get to the Final Two. And we should keep Lydia and
365,00:25:23.58,00:25:23.58,then we'll have a better shot of winning the Final Three immunity
366,00:25:26.58,00:25:26.58,challenge. I mean it's possible it is a
367,00:25:29.29,00:25:29.29,"better strategic decision, but I promised Danni that I would go"
368,00:25:33.08,00:25:33.08,to the Final Three with her. >> Right.
369,00:25:43.79,00:25:43.79,>> Rafe promised me top three. But you know how that goes.
370,00:25:48.25,00:25:48.25,"Everybody goes back on their word, and so I am very uneasy"
371,00:25:51.42,00:25:51.42,about it. >> I thought we had a plateful.
372,00:26:09.12,00:26:09.12,>> Is that chicken carcass still over there?
373,00:26:10.62,00:26:10.62,">> Yeah, you want to check it out?"
374,00:26:12.62,00:26:12.62,>> Can we do that or no? >> I would try it.
375,00:26:16.25,00:26:16.25,>> I could tell since we had that ritual that Steph wanted to
376,00:26:19.83,00:26:19.83,eat that chicken. >> I will go check it out.
377,00:26:23.25,00:26:23.25,"Lydia, want to check that chicken out?"
378,00:26:30.79,00:26:30.79,>> Looks like it may be good. >> It is. Look. Oh my gosh.
379,00:26:36.83,00:26:36.83,">> Oh, we got to eat it. >> Bring it over and see what"
380,00:26:39.04,00:26:39.04,"people think. >> Um, look at all these ants."
381,00:26:47.50,00:26:47.50,>> I've already asked him. But he hasn't given me an answer
382,00:26:50.38,00:26:50.38,yet. You have a chance to be bouncing
383,00:26:52.96,00:26:52.96,"something on your head and win and I would rather go with you,"
384,00:26:56.25,00:26:56.25,me and Rafe than you picking Danni.
385,00:26:58.29,00:26:58.29,>> Okay. Will you let me know? >> I will.
386,00:27:00.75,00:27:00.75,">> Thank you. >> Actually, I think Stephenie"
387,00:27:03.62,00:27:03.62,is leaning towards taking me to the Final Three because I don't
388,00:27:07.25,00:27:07.25,have no threat when it comes to immunity challenge tomorrow.
389,00:27:10.75,00:27:10.75,"You know, if I wasn't voted out tonight."
390,00:27:14.54,00:27:14.54,">> You guys, it looks so good. I mean, we can say a little"
391,00:27:18.25,00:27:18.25,"prayer or something, if you want, to make you feel better."
392,00:27:21.04,00:27:21.04,>> Are you guys okay with this? We are surviving out here.
393,00:27:24.25,00:27:24.25,We have no food but corn. >> We haven't eaten in 37 days.
394,00:27:26.42,00:27:26.42,There's a chicken over there that's cooked with honey...
395,00:27:29.04,00:27:29.04,">> Oh, no, I will eat it. I will so eat it."
396,00:27:31.92,00:27:31.92,">> You know what? This is part of survival, right?"
397,00:27:34.08,00:27:34.08,">> Got to be okay to eat it, right, Lydia?"
398,00:27:35.92,00:27:35.92,">> My gosh, it is delicious. Rafe, are you okay?"
399,00:27:41.75,00:27:41.75,"It is cooked chicken, man. You would eat it if your mom"
400,00:27:45.21,00:27:45.21,cooked it. >> It was kind of a powerful
401,00:27:47.42,00:27:47.42,experience today to watch the ritual and I felt that I learned
402,00:27:51.42,00:27:51.42,"so much about sacrifice. >> Rafe, what's the problem?"
403,00:27:54.50,00:27:54.50,>> I don't know. It is like they just came and
404,00:27:57.21,00:27:57.21,sacrificed it. So I felt like for me to eat the
405,00:28:00.29,00:28:00.29,chicken would just be totally pointless and I would lose
406,00:28:03.25,00:28:03.25,everything that I learned from the ritual because the ritual
407,00:28:07.21,00:28:07.21,was about not eating the chicken.
408,00:28:09.83,00:28:09.83,>> We are surviving out here. >> I think I will pass.
409,00:28:13.25,00:28:13.25,You guys eat it though. >> Okay.
410,00:28:15.08,00:28:15.08,>> Okay. >> It is day 37.
411,00:28:17.12,00:28:17.12,You're gonna let the chicken just sit there and let the bugs
412,00:28:19.79,00:28:19.79,get it? No way. I am going to eat it.
413,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,"They came, they did their sacrifice and we prayed with"
414,00:28:24.38,00:28:24.38,them. But it's hours later and the
415,00:28:26.96,00:28:26.96,chicken is still there and I am eating it.
416,00:28:47.38,00:28:47.38,">> After eating the chicken, a huge storm moves in, lots of"
417,00:28:51.12,00:28:51.12,"lightening. Actually, the biggest since we"
418,00:28:53.08,00:28:53.08,"have been here and we started talking about, ""Oh, no, maybe"
419,00:28:57.00,00:28:57.00,"there is something to this."" (thunder crashing)"
420,00:29:10.75,00:29:10.75,>> That is freaky. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
421,00:29:40.58,00:29:40.58,"the members of our jury. Bobby Jon, Jamie, Gary, Judd and"
422,00:29:48.12,00:29:48.12,Cindy voted out at the last Tribal Council.
423,00:29:55.50,00:29:55.50,"So take me through the day. Rafe, it started with a very"
424,00:30:01.71,00:30:01.71,unique ceremony. An authentic Maya blessing?
425,00:30:05.08,00:30:05.08,>> Yes. We started out the day and had
426,00:30:07.54,00:30:07.54,five Mayans came up to camp and kind of put all this stuff on
427,00:30:12.42,00:30:12.42,the ground and sacrificed the chicken in front of the temple
428,00:30:15.92,00:30:15.92,to thank the ancestors for building this place and kind of
429,00:30:19.83,00:30:19.83,get their connection to the past.
430,00:30:22.17,00:30:22.17,>> PROBST: Does it connect you more to this land after being
431,00:30:24.21,00:30:24.21,"part of something like that? >> Yes, it defintely does."
432,00:30:27.08,00:30:27.08,To see this is a place that these Maya are living today
433,00:30:30.88,00:30:30.88,"actually come to do rituals. It was like, wow, we are really"
434,00:30:34.92,00:30:34.92,here and really a part of what's going on in this culture.
435,00:30:39.08,00:30:39.08,">> PROBST: So you get back to camp, Lydia."
436,00:30:41.42,00:30:41.42,I don't know about you. It poured where I was.
437,00:30:44.38,00:30:44.38,Did you guys get a storm? >> Yes. A big one.
438,00:30:47.04,00:30:47.04,"Thunder and lightning. Not only that, Jeff."
439,00:30:49.88,00:30:49.88,"Well, there's a possibility with something that we did."
440,00:30:54.67,00:30:54.67,"( laughter ) >> Damn it, Lydia."
441,00:30:58.79,00:30:58.79,Explain it. >> I don't know how to explain
442,00:31:01.92,00:31:01.92,"it. >> Okay, Jeff."
443,00:31:03.58,00:31:03.58,"You know what, being here 37 days, you know we have only had"
444,00:31:07.50,00:31:07.50,"corn. Well, you know that chicken that"
445,00:31:10.67,00:31:10.67,they gave to the temple and to the gods?
446,00:31:14.17,00:31:14.17,>> PROBST: You ate the chicken? >> We ate the chicken.
447,00:31:17.17,00:31:17.17,">> PROBST: Wow. >> And, Jeff, after we ate the"
448,00:31:19.92,00:31:19.92,"chicken, I know for a fact the Mayan gods were upset with us."
449,00:31:23.92,00:31:23.92,Because why would it thunder and lightning and pour down rain?
450,00:31:28.17,00:31:28.17,"I mean, it was scary. >> PROBST: Rafe, you really"
451,00:31:31.67,00:31:31.67,"don't respect the ceremony? >> Actually, I didn't eat the"
452,00:31:34.38,00:31:34.38,chicken. >> PROBST: You did not eat it.
453,00:31:36.67,00:31:36.67,>> PROBST: Danni did you eat it? >> Yes.
454,00:31:38.96,00:31:38.96,">> PROBST: Steph, you ate it? >> Yes."
455,00:31:40.92,00:31:40.92,>> PROBST: I am not judging you guys whether it was right or
456,00:31:43.38,00:31:43.38,"wrong, but we're definitely going to talk about it."
457,00:31:45.75,00:31:45.75,>> I respected the ritual. I thought it was amazing.
458,00:31:47.62,00:31:47.62,But we have been here 37 days and we're starving and we
459,00:31:50.46,00:31:50.46,"decided collectively, as a group, we were going to eat it."
460,00:31:53.58,00:31:53.58,"The storm was weird. Yeah, I mean, we really thought"
461,00:31:57.75,00:31:57.75,the reason it did storm was because we did eat the chicken.
462,00:32:04.33,00:32:04.33,">> PROBST: All right. So, Lydia, how surprised would"
463,00:32:08.25,00:32:08.25,you be if it is you tonight? 'Cause it's a one-in-three
464,00:32:11.29,00:32:11.29,chance it is you. >> I feel that I don't pose a
465,00:32:14.42,00:32:14.42,physical threat to anybody. I have not won anything since
466,00:32:18.25,00:32:18.25,"day one. So if they choose me to stay in,"
467,00:32:21.46,00:32:21.46,they have a better shot in going to the Final Two.
468,00:32:25.54,00:32:25.54,"They really, really do. >> PROBST: Danni, Lydia makes a"
469,00:32:29.08,00:32:29.08,"good point. >> Well, yeah, she does, but"
470,00:32:32.12,00:32:32.12,"she ends up in the Final Two, Lydia is your clear winner,"
471,00:32:35.29,00:32:35.29,because everybody loves Lydia. I think that's why she would be
472,00:32:39.17,00:32:39.17,"a bigger threat. >> PROBST: Steph, at this point"
473,00:32:41.58,00:32:41.58,"in the game, what do you base your vote on?"
474,00:32:44.29,00:32:44.29,">> Lydia is a huge, huge mental threat and she's well-liked."
475,00:32:48.04,00:32:48.04,"Same thing with Danni, though. Danni is a pretty big threat and"
476,00:32:51.54,00:32:51.54,she's also really well-liked because she's never really had
477,00:32:54.71,00:32:54.71,"to back stab anybody. So for me, it is a pretty hard"
478,00:32:59.12,00:32:59.12,decision tonight. >> PROBST: All right.
479,00:33:02.88,00:33:02.88,"Just to be official. Rafe, you have immunity."
480,00:33:05.25,00:33:05.25,>> I'm keeping it. >> PROBST: Rafe is the only one
481,00:33:07.25,00:33:07.25,you cannot vote for. It is time to vote.
482,00:33:09.79,00:33:09.79,"Rafe, you're up. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
483,00:33:42.75,00:33:42.75,votes. Once the votes are read the
484,00:33:56.04,00:33:56.04,decision is final and the person voted out is asked to leave the
485,00:33:59.46,00:33:59.46,Tribal Council area immediately. I will read the votes.
486,00:34:02.62,00:34:02.62,First vote: Danni. Lydia.
487,00:34:11.08,00:34:11.08,One vote Lydia. One vote Danni.
488,00:34:16.08,00:34:16.08,Lydia. Two votes Lydia.
489,00:34:19.75,00:34:19.75,One vote Danni. I will read the last vote.
490,00:34:24.04,00:34:24.04,"15th person voted out of Survivor: Guatemala, Lydia."
491,00:34:27.12,00:34:27.12,"Lydia, you need to bring me your torch."
492,00:34:30.04,00:34:30.04,>> Thank you. Thank you. Stay strong.
493,00:34:37.42,00:34:37.42,">> PROBST: Lydia, the tribe has spoken."
494,00:34:42.79,00:34:42.79,"It's time for you to go. Rafe, Danni, Steph, you have"
495,00:34:55.96,00:34:55.96,survived another Tribal Council and made it to the Final Three.
496,00:35:00.04,00:35:00.04,Tomorrow you will take part in your final immunity challenge.
497,00:35:03.17,00:35:03.17,Hope the gods have forgiven you. Grab your torches and head back
498,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,to camp and try to get some sleep.
499,00:35:16.08,00:35:16.08,>> This was by far the hardest experience I have ever had in my
500,00:35:19.25,00:35:19.25,life. The heat and the mosquitoes and
501,00:35:21.88,00:35:21.88,hardly any food. So I am very proud of myself.
502,00:35:24.96,00:35:24.96,"You know, just the history alone and being in the ruins all on a"
503,00:35:28.88,00:35:28.88,"daily basis for 37 days was a very, very incredible"
504,00:35:33.38,00:35:33.38,experience. And I would not trade this for
505,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,the world. (monkey howling)
506,00:36:18.88,00:36:18.88,(howling continues) >> That monkey is so annoying.
507,00:36:27.08,00:36:27.08,">> It's day 38, we were up a lot earlier today than we have been"
508,00:36:31.00,00:36:31.00,up in a while. Monkeys were really loud.
509,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,"Louder than usual. Trying to boil water, it poured"
510,00:36:38.08,00:36:38.08,"last night, so everything is wet."
511,00:36:40.79,00:36:40.79,">> Oh, my gosh. It smells so bad."
512,00:36:44.04,00:36:44.04,"The corn is, like, disgusting. There's maggots in it."
513,00:36:47.25,00:36:47.25,It is moldy. It is nasty.
514,00:36:50.46,00:36:50.46,"But, um, it is day 38. So you have to be happy--"
515,00:36:53.29,00:36:53.29,"whether you eat or drink or not. >> ""Congratulations, Final"
516,00:37:05.04,00:37:05.04,Three. Today you will pay tribute to
517,00:37:07.42,00:37:07.42,your 15 fallen comrades. Hike from camp to the temple
518,00:37:11.08,00:37:11.08,ruins where you will find the torches and images of survivors
519,00:37:14.54,00:37:14.54,"who played the game but were outwitted, outplayed and"
520,00:37:17.79,00:37:17.79,outlasted. Take the images of your former
521,00:37:20.21,00:37:20.21,tribe mates and immortalize their memory by sacrificing them
522,00:37:23.92,00:37:23.92,to the fire. At the end of this journey you
523,00:37:27.04,00:37:27.04,will compete in one final immunity challenge.
524,00:37:30.04,00:37:30.04,"Tonight one of you will join the 15 who are already gone."""
525,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,>> It is such a huge honor to go through and reflect back on the
526,00:37:42.08,00:37:42.08,game and everybody we played with.
527,00:37:44.58,00:37:44.58,"There were some tough, tough competitors."
528,00:37:57.25,00:37:57.25,>> Jim. He was one tough guy. Led us through the jungle.
529,00:38:01.71,00:38:01.71,If it hadn't been for him we wouldn't have won the first
530,00:38:04.38,00:38:04.38,reward challenge. >> He was a great guy.
531,00:38:08.92,00:38:08.92,>> Being in a game is something I thought about ever since that
532,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,"first Survivor. Who doesn't say I can do that,"
533,00:38:14.88,00:38:14.88,"but who says that when you are 63, you know?"
534,00:38:18.46,00:38:18.46,I am not out to be some hero. I am out to prove things myself
535,00:38:21.50,00:38:21.50,"and maybe to motivate somebody. >> Hi, Morgan."
536,00:38:30.25,00:38:30.25,>> She was definitely a fighter. >> I look like this sorority
537,00:38:36.54,00:38:36.54,girl that can't do anything. It didn't turn out to be so
538,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,hard for me physically. It was hard in a way I never
539,00:38:43.38,00:38:43.38,expected it to be. It was hard socially and that's
540,00:38:47.38,00:38:47.38,where it got me. >> Brianna.
541,00:38:55.71,00:38:55.71,>> Who expects some girl that goes shopping every day to go
542,00:38:59.54,00:38:59.54,out and survive in the jungle? I couldn't have asked for more
543,00:39:03.38,00:39:03.38,of a culture shock. I take away a whole new respect
544,00:39:06.33,00:39:06.33,for everyone playing this game. It is hard.
545,00:39:09.08,00:39:09.08,"It is brutal out there. >> Hi, Brookster."
546,00:39:17.62,00:39:17.62,>> The whole experience was a lot more difficult than I
547,00:39:20.04,00:39:20.04,expected. But I was really surprised at
548,00:39:22.46,00:39:22.46,how my body was able to adapt to the whole situation.
549,00:39:25.54,00:39:25.54,I realized that limits were very much in my mind and there's so
550,00:39:29.29,00:39:29.29,much more I can accomplish if I don't stop myself.
551,00:39:36.04,00:39:36.04,>> The golden boy. >> Golden boy!
552,00:39:38.96,00:39:38.96,( laughter ) \xe2\x99\xaa With the golden hair. \xe2\x99\xaa
553,00:39:41.33,00:39:41.33,>> I came here with some focused goals and one was to always have
554,00:39:44.12,00:39:44.12,a smile on my face. That was tough being that my
555,00:39:46.88,00:39:46.88,body shut down so bad. I came out with my honor and
556,00:39:50.25,00:39:50.25,"integrity, two things I would rather walk with, than $1"
557,00:39:52.83,00:39:52.83,million. I am young.
558,00:39:54.58,00:39:54.58,I will make that money eventually.
559,00:40:10.75,00:40:10.75,>> Margaret. >> Margaret. One tough mama.
560,00:40:16.79,00:40:16.79,">> I learned that I was a strong woman, much the motherly,"
561,00:40:20.75,00:40:20.75,"nursing, nurturing kind. But not so vulnerable and weak"
562,00:40:25.42,00:40:25.42,to lay down and be rolled over. I kept my integrity.
563,00:40:28.88,00:40:28.88,I have a great deal of pride about how I played the game.
564,00:40:33.71,00:40:33.71,">> Here's Brian. Happy trails, Brian."
565,00:40:37.50,00:40:37.50,>> I played this game so hard for every second I was in it.
566,00:40:40.50,00:40:40.50,I honestly believed I was going to win this game.
567,00:40:43.29,00:40:43.29,"But I have absolutely no regret, because if you're going"
568,00:40:46.12,00:40:46.12,"to go, go the way I went where you are blind-sided."
569,00:40:49.21,00:40:49.21,"As far as I am concerned, that's the way to go."
570,00:40:54.25,00:40:54.25,">> Here is our Amy. >> Oh, my gosh."
571,00:40:56.58,00:40:56.58,I never heard more swear words. >> When I came into this game I
572,00:41:03.33,00:41:03.33,was never going to give up. When I sprained my ankle and had
573,00:41:06.42,00:41:06.42,"to go out again, I sucked it up and dealt with the pain and won"
574,00:41:09.75,00:41:09.75,the match. I think back and wonder what did
575,00:41:12.04,00:41:12.04,I do? I feel good about where I stand.
576,00:41:18.12,00:41:18.12,">> Brandon. Oh, my gosh. Nobody could cut ropes like"
577,00:41:21.38,00:41:21.38,Brandon. That's for sure. >> It was like nothing I have
578,00:41:25.54,00:41:25.54,ever experienced. Pretty much one big blurry ass-
579,00:41:28.62,00:41:28.62,"whooping and I got voted off. Being from the Midwest, I have"
580,00:41:32.83,00:41:32.83,always wanted to travel. Having come out here made me
581,00:41:35.62,00:41:35.62,think it is not that hard. Just going to go out there and
582,00:41:38.46,00:41:38.46,seize it. >> Good ol' Bobby Jon.
583,00:41:45.83,00:41:45.83,>> This go around I am supposed to be this person that was such
584,00:41:49.46,00:41:49.46,a hard competitor. I am Bobby Jon.
585,00:41:51.67,00:41:51.67,I am tough. Right. Whatever. I got humbled by mother nature.
586,00:41:55.12,00:41:55.12,"It showed me, hey, guess what, big shot, you ain't the man."
587,00:41:59.21,00:41:59.21,"It was a refining moment for me, and I needed it."
588,00:42:07.21,00:42:07.21,>> Jamie. >> Jamie...
589,00:42:10.12,00:42:10.12,">> Yeah... >> See you later, Jamie."
590,00:42:17.25,00:42:17.25,>> The thing I missed the most was being able to trust people.
591,00:42:20.92,00:42:20.92,That's what I am sure everybody misses most in the jungle is
592,00:42:23.62,00:42:23.62,someone that actually cares. I wish I would have had four
593,00:42:27.00,00:42:27.00,"people that wasn't going to harm me, but it's gonna make me a"
594,00:42:30.42,00:42:30.42,more honest person. >> Gary.
595,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,>> Like a father figure to me out here.
596,00:42:39.62,00:42:39.62,">> Me, too. >> Me, too."
597,00:42:43.29,00:42:43.29,>> There's no doubt in my mind that competition is just like
598,00:42:46.33,00:42:46.33,"life. You have to communicate, be part"
599,00:42:48.67,00:42:48.67,"of a team, work as hard as you possibly can if you want to get"
600,00:42:51.88,00:42:51.88,to where you want to be. That's what I'm going to take
601,00:42:54.29,00:42:54.29,back with me. >> Sounds good.
602,00:43:00.62,00:43:00.62,>> It's Judd. >> Judd.
603,00:43:03.17,00:43:03.17,>> I call this Survivor experience for me like a mental
604,00:43:04.96,00:43:04.96,rehab. I never went camping before.
605,00:43:07.67,00:43:07.67,So I am going back a whole new man.
606,00:43:10.08,00:43:10.08,"I mean, much more relaxed. I won't be a hot head and run"
607,00:43:12.96,00:43:12.96,around like a lunatic. >> Cindy.
608,00:43:19.79,00:43:19.79,"Bye, Cindy. >> Never in a million years"
609,00:43:23.88,00:43:23.88,could I have conjured up the past 36 days of my life.
610,00:43:27.25,00:43:27.25,I made the most of the situation and left the game with a brand
611,00:43:30.25,00:43:30.25,"new car. So, I can't think of anything I"
612,00:43:32.96,00:43:32.96,"can possibly complain about, other than not winning."
613,00:43:37.62,00:43:37.62,">> Oh, Lydia. >> Lydia, oh, Lydia."
614,00:43:40.62,00:43:40.62,"We didn't want to get rid of ya. >> For 37 days, I always thought"
615,00:43:46.62,00:43:46.62,"that I'm just a provider. I am more than that, and I never"
616,00:43:50.17,00:43:50.17,thought I was. It really brought me out of my
617,00:43:53.71,00:43:53.71,shell. I am very proud of myself.
618,00:43:56.62,00:43:56.62,"But I tell you, no more corn for me-- I guarantee it."
619,00:44:20.17,00:44:20.17,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Ready to get to the final"
620,00:44:28.71,00:44:28.71,immunity challenge? >> Yes.
621,00:44:31.25,00:44:31.25,">> PROBST: First things first, Rafe."
622,00:44:36.50,00:44:36.50,"For the last time, immunity is back up for grabs."
623,00:44:40.25,00:44:40.25,Today's immunity challenge will require balance and intense
624,00:44:44.92,00:44:44.92,concentration. Here is how it works.
625,00:44:48.12,00:44:48.12,You must balance on a wobbly platform for as long as you can.
626,00:44:52.88,00:44:52.88,"The platform swivels 360 degrees, offers very little"
627,00:44:57.17,00:44:57.17,"stability. For the first hour, you will"
628,00:44:59.42,00:44:59.42,have the aid of two ropes-- one for each hand.
629,00:45:03.25,00:45:03.25,"That will help you find your center of balance, get"
630,00:45:05.25,00:45:05.25,"comfortable with the platform. After one hour, you will release"
631,00:45:07.58,00:45:07.58,one rope. This is when it becomes more
632,00:45:09.92,00:45:09.92,difficult. You still have one rope to hold
633,00:45:12.25,00:45:12.25,onto. If after 30 minutes you are
634,00:45:14.58,00:45:14.58,"still hanging on, you'll release the second rope, and you'll go"
635,00:45:17.96,00:45:17.96,it alone. The person left standing wins
636,00:45:20.88,00:45:20.88,"immunity, guaranteed a spot in the final two, and as"
637,00:45:24.04,00:45:24.04,"importantly, will decide who goes with them to that final"
638,00:45:27.67,00:45:27.67,Tribal Council-- who sits across from that jury with a million
639,00:45:30.00,00:45:30.00,dollars on the line. I know it's worth playing for.
640,00:45:32.17,00:45:32.17,We'll draw for spots and get started.
641,00:45:39.54,00:45:39.54,"Okay, everybody, leap up. Land your feet on the platform."
642,00:45:44.71,00:45:44.71,This challenge has begun. We're going one hour with both
643,00:45:49.04,00:45:49.04,ropes. That swivel is very sensitive.
644,00:46:17.54,00:46:17.54,>> PROBST: 20 minutes. >> Left?
645,00:46:20.38,00:46:20.38,>> PROBST: In. You've only been up there 20
646,00:46:23.46,00:46:23.46,minutes. You just passed the 40-minute
647,00:46:48.58,00:46:48.58,mark. ( monkeys grunting in distance )
648,00:46:54.42,00:46:54.42,Howler monkeys saying hello. ( grunting )
649,00:46:58.25,00:46:58.25,"Danni, you've had immunity once. >> Yes."
650,00:47:01.04,00:47:01.04,>> PROBST: Steph? >> Once.
651,00:47:02.92,00:47:02.92,>> PROBST: Once. Rafe?
652,00:47:04.67,00:47:04.67,>> Four times. >> PROBST: One minute left.
653,00:47:21.96,00:47:21.96,You need to begin to prepare to release one rope.
654,00:47:25.21,00:47:25.21,"Can be either hand. If you lose your balance, you"
655,00:47:28.17,00:47:28.17,are not out until your feet hit the base of the platform.
656,00:47:37.29,00:47:37.29,">> PROBST: Five, four, three, two, one."
657,00:47:43.38,00:47:43.38,Release a rope. Steph in trouble.
658,00:47:53.50,00:47:53.50,Steph fighting to stay on. Got to get back to that board.
659,00:47:57.46,00:47:57.46,She's still alive till her feet hit the ground.
660,00:48:01.83,00:48:01.83,"Danni's swiveling, she's in trouble."
661,00:48:04.92,00:48:04.92,Don't let those legs hit. Rafe's starting to wobble.
662,00:48:08.46,00:48:08.46,Rafe's in trouble. Everybody hanging on by their
663,00:48:10.42,00:48:10.42,rope. Rafe trying to get back.
664,00:48:12.75,00:48:12.75,Do not let your feet touch. Steph has found a position.
665,00:48:21.92,00:48:21.92,Barely hanging on. Rafe's struggling.
666,00:48:26.83,00:48:26.83,Danni's found a position. Rafe has found a spot.
667,00:48:31.04,00:48:31.04,Everybody found the same spot. Everybody's instincts kicked in.
668,00:48:46.25,00:48:46.25,Everybody utilized everything there was in this challenge.
669,00:48:50.42,00:48:50.42,Now it's going to be endurance. How long can you stay in this
670,00:48:53.67,00:48:53.67,position? >> PROBST: Down to one minute.
671,00:49:17.08,00:49:17.08,"When your hands come off that final rope, your hands are no"
672,00:49:19.50,00:49:19.50,longer a part of this challenge. I want to make sure everybody's
673,00:49:22.04,00:49:22.04,clear. Your hands cannot touch the
674,00:49:24.96,00:49:24.96,post. Ten seconds.
675,00:49:29.04,00:49:29.04,"Same as before-- when I say ""release,"" release."
676,00:49:32.17,00:49:32.17,"Five, four, three, two, one. Release."
677,00:50:04.46,00:50:04.46,Rafe. Your hand touched the pole.
678,00:50:08.04,00:50:08.04,You're out. Have a seat.
679,00:50:14.79,00:50:14.79,Rafe lost his concentration. That's how quickly you can be
680,00:50:19.21,00:50:19.21,"out of this challenge. Rafe, you look either very sad"
681,00:50:26.38,00:50:26.38,or out of it. >> I can't believe I just lost
682,00:50:32.71,00:50:32.71,"focus for, like, two seconds. ( Steph grunts )"
683,00:50:52.50,00:50:52.50,">> PROBST: Steph, when we started this part of the"
684,00:50:55.08,00:50:55.08,"challenge, you were about four feet further up on that post."
685,00:50:59.46,00:50:59.46,( Steph sighs ) >> I know.
686,00:51:02.38,00:51:02.38,>> PROBST: That hat was at the small of your back.
687,00:51:04.54,00:51:04.54,It's now in the crook of your neck.
688,00:51:07.12,00:51:07.12,>> My lower back is killing me. >> PROBST: How are you feeling
689,00:51:20.79,00:51:20.79,"now, Danni? >> Feel the same."
690,00:51:22.88,00:51:22.88,">> PROBST: How about you, Steph? >> I can't move."
691,00:51:35.79,00:51:35.79,( sniffles ) ( pained sigh )
692,00:52:05.04,00:52:05.04,>> I can't move. >> PROBST: Steph is out.
693,00:52:08.92,00:52:08.92,Danni has won final immunity. ( Steph crying )
694,00:52:24.25,00:52:24.25,">> Danni, I want to, um... I want to release you from any"
695,00:52:29.08,00:52:29.08,"promise you made to me about who you take to the final two, and"
696,00:52:32.08,00:52:32.08,"like, take whoever you want tonight."
697,00:52:34.33,00:52:34.33,I'm really serious about that and I really mean it.
698,00:52:36.88,00:52:36.88,Okay? >> Okay.
699,00:52:38.92,00:52:38.92,You are a great guy. >> That's what I mean.
700,00:52:42.00,00:52:42.00,Okay? >> You did such a good job.
701,00:52:45.00,00:52:45.00,>> I sucked. ( Steph sniffles )
702,00:52:49.17,00:52:49.17,"Oh, God. ( Rafe speaks indistinctly )"
703,00:52:51.12,00:52:51.12,>> You don't suck. You're here.
704,00:52:53.92,00:52:53.92,>> I cannot move my back. >> PROBST: Danni.
705,00:52:59.58,00:52:59.58,">> Oh, sorry. >> PROBST: You don't need to"
706,00:53:01.75,00:53:01.75,move. >> Thank you.
707,00:53:03.50,00:53:03.50,>> PROBST: Immunity. You are safe tonight at Tribal
708,00:53:05.50,00:53:05.50,Council. Big decision.
709,00:53:07.42,00:53:07.42,You're going to the final two. Who's going with you... Steph or
710,00:53:09.83,00:53:09.83,Rafe? You have the afternoon to figure
711,00:53:13.25,00:53:13.25,that out. See you guys tonight at Tribal.
712,00:53:35.92,00:53:35.92,">> Oh, my gosh. You did so good."
713,00:53:40.92,00:53:40.92,>> You really did. >> I am shocked that I am in the
714,00:53:44.17,00:53:44.17,final two. It's just overwhelming to think
715,00:53:46.17,00:53:46.17,"about having the numbers against me, and here I am."
716,00:53:48.67,00:53:48.67,And I'm just blown away about it.
717,00:53:51.50,00:53:51.50,I am happy I won but I hate being put in... I just hate
718,00:53:54.21,00:53:54.21,spot. >> Don't feel you have to do it
719,00:53:56.46,00:53:56.46,"just because you made a promise. You know, you should make your"
720,00:53:59.25,00:53:59.25,decision tonight based on whatever you make your decision
721,00:54:01.54,00:54:01.54,"on. >> You know, it's was horrible"
722,00:54:04.88,00:54:04.88,coming into camp. It's like you have this high
723,00:54:07.12,00:54:07.12,from winning immunity and then you realize I'm going to have to
724,00:54:09.92,00:54:09.92,"vote out, you know, one of the two-- Stephenie or Rafe-- that"
725,00:54:12.38,00:54:12.38,have been... really have been loyal to me.
726,00:54:15.67,00:54:15.67,"Originally, I was set on taking Rafe because I gave him my word."
727,00:54:18.67,00:54:18.67,"But then Rafe told me, he goes ""I will release you from any"
728,00:54:21.38,00:54:21.38,"promises or bonds. Do whatever you need to do."""
729,00:54:23.62,00:54:23.62,So that puts even more pressure on me.
730,00:54:25.67,00:54:25.67,>> I hate being in this position.
731,00:54:28.71,00:54:28.71,She fought so hard today. >> She did.
732,00:54:31.12,00:54:31.12,"That's why I feel like, you know..."
733,00:54:34.21,00:54:34.21,>> Her legs were shaking. >> I sat there and watched it.
734,00:54:38.88,00:54:38.88,"It was horrible. And that's why I felt, like, I"
735,00:54:41.29,00:54:41.29,don't know. I just didn't feel right going
736,00:54:43.58,00:54:43.58,"into Tribal Council tonight, like, it being a done deal"
737,00:54:45.71,00:54:45.71,just 'cause you promised me something.
738,00:54:47.46,00:54:47.46,You know what I mean? >> Yeah.
739,00:54:49.58,00:54:49.58,">> I mean, obviously, I still would like it if you took me"
740,00:54:53.25,00:54:53.25,to the final two. Danni wouldn't be here if it
741,00:54:57.42,00:54:57.42,weren't for me. But I feel good about letting
742,00:55:00.62,00:55:00.62,"Danni out of her promise because to me, tonight, like, I want"
743,00:55:05.17,00:55:05.17,Steph and I to still be fighting together.
744,00:55:08.04,00:55:08.04,We have been fighting together since day one.
745,00:55:10.25,00:55:10.25,I feel like Steph deserves a chance.
746,00:55:17.12,00:55:17.12,>> You don't have to give me anything.
747,00:55:19.12,00:55:19.12,"You don't owe me anything. >> No, I-I do."
748,00:55:21.96,00:55:21.96,I owe you and Rafe both. >> Rafe and I could have
749,00:55:24.58,00:55:24.58,guaranteed ourselves the final two spot if we took Lydia.
750,00:55:27.04,00:55:27.04,>> I really don't think I have a shot really over either one of
751,00:55:29.71,00:55:29.71,"you. Because, I mean, everybody loves"
752,00:55:31.75,00:55:31.75,"Rafe. And then, you know, you were so"
753,00:55:34.21,00:55:34.21,"tight with that group. But they, uh, you know, they"
754,00:55:36.96,00:55:36.96,tend to forget all that stuff. >> I think I have a 50-50 chance
755,00:55:41.12,00:55:41.12,right now. I have no idea what Danni's
756,00:55:43.08,00:55:43.08,gonna do at this point. And if she decides to bring Rafe
757,00:55:45.96,00:55:45.96,"to the final two then, you know what, I played the best game I"
758,00:55:49.08,00:55:49.08,know how to play. And I'm not gonna be ashamed of
759,00:55:51.00,00:55:51.00,"that. >> Stephenie, I really don't"
760,00:55:53.12,00:55:53.12,know. >> I know.
761,00:55:55.71,00:55:55.71,"Why don't you just go with your heart, you know, when you get"
762,00:55:57.96,00:55:57.96,there. Go with it.
763,00:56:00.17,00:56:00.17,">> Oh, God. I am still really torn between"
764,00:56:03.88,00:56:03.88,"Rafe and Stephenie. You know, I am competing for a"
765,00:56:06.17,00:56:06.17,"million dollars, you know, and you have to really think about"
766,00:56:08.71,00:56:08.71,what you're gonna do here at the final two.
767,00:56:10.79,00:56:10.79,And it's so hard. It's such a hard decision.
768,00:56:12.96,00:56:12.96,"But, you know, you're here to win."
769,00:56:16.79,00:56:16.79,It's definitely going to be a game time decision.
770,00:56:19.08,00:56:19.08,I'm not gonna be ready until I have to walk up there and write
771,00:56:22.12,00:56:22.12,a name down tonight. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
772,00:56:50.62,00:56:50.62,the members of the jury. Bobby Jon.
773,00:56:54.21,00:56:54.21,Jamie. Gary.
774,00:56:59.17,00:56:59.17,Judd. Cindy.
775,00:57:01.46,00:57:01.46,"And Lydia, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
776,00:57:10.12,00:57:10.12,"So... Rafe, Danni, Steph. The last Tribal Council, after"
777,00:57:16.54,00:57:16.54,"weeks of voting out the strongest, just when you are on"
778,00:57:20.25,00:57:20.25,"the cusp of your last challenge, you vote out not one of the"
779,00:57:24.54,00:57:24.54,"strongest, but the weakest. And for two of you, it could be"
780,00:57:28.42,00:57:28.42,"a million dollar mistake. Steph, any regrets looking at"
781,00:57:31.08,00:57:31.08,Lydia over there? >> I don't.
782,00:57:33.12,00:57:33.12,"I mean, I didn't know if today's challenge was gonna be"
783,00:57:35.54,00:57:35.54,completely physical or completely mental.
784,00:57:37.25,00:57:37.25,"So, it could have gone either way."
785,00:57:39.33,00:57:39.33,>> PROBST: But wait. Let's hold off on that.
786,00:57:41.38,00:57:41.38,"In 95% of the challenges, Rafe, Danni, Steph, Lydia's gonna be"
787,00:57:45.79,00:57:45.79,"the weak person. >> Well, the only chance I had"
788,00:57:49.12,00:57:49.12,was to tie it up at the last Tribal Council.
789,00:57:51.75,00:57:51.75,Because Rafe already gave Danni his word and he wasn't changing
790,00:57:54.21,00:57:54.21,his vote. But that still wouldn't have
791,00:57:55.96,00:57:55.96,even guaranteed Lydia staying here.
792,00:57:57.58,00:57:57.58,"So you know what, go against the best."
793,00:58:00.12,00:58:00.12,"And if she beats me fair and square, she beats me fair and"
794,00:58:03.00,00:58:03.00,"square and she deserves it. >> PROBST: Danni, did you ever"
795,00:58:07.21,00:58:07.21,imagine a guaranteed spot in the final two and you decide who's
796,00:58:10.75,00:58:10.75,gonna sit next to you? >> I am so blown away that I am
797,00:58:13.42,00:58:13.42,in this position. I can't believe I won immunity
798,00:58:15.54,00:58:15.54,today. I went back to camp and I'm just
799,00:58:18.21,00:58:18.21,"like, ""Did that really happen?"" I mean, I cannot believe that"
800,00:58:21.25,00:58:21.25,I'm still here. It was an absolute miracle.
801,00:58:23.38,00:58:23.38,">> PROBST: Steph, you were very emotional when you finally went"
802,00:58:26.12,00:58:26.12,down. >> It was such a tough
803,00:58:28.25,00:58:28.25,challenge. I was in so much pain and I just
804,00:58:31.00,00:58:31.00,"felt like a failure. You know, I went until I"
805,00:58:33.29,00:58:33.29,collapsed and I just sat there and pretty much just cried for a
806,00:58:37.21,00:58:37.21,"couple minutes. >> PROBST: Rafe, you said"
807,00:58:39.21,00:58:39.21,something to Danni right after the challenge.
808,00:58:41.54,00:58:41.54,I caught a couple of words. >> Yeah. Danni had promised me a
809,00:58:44.12,00:58:44.12,long time ago that if I could somehow get her to the final
810,00:58:46.83,00:58:46.83,"three and she won the challenge, she'd take me to the final two."
811,00:58:50.25,00:58:50.25,"And so, I told Danni, ""I release you from the promise."""
812,00:58:54.12,00:58:54.12,>> PROBST: Why would you do that?
813,00:58:56.04,00:58:56.04,It sounds like you put everything on today's challenge
814,00:58:59.08,00:58:59.08,and nothing on the past 37 days. >> I am saying forget about that
815,00:59:02.38,00:59:02.38,one promise that you made and if you think that I'm worthy of
816,00:59:05.62,00:59:05.62,"going to the final two, then take me to the final two."
817,00:59:08.25,00:59:08.25,"If you think it's Steph, then take Steph."
818,00:59:10.75,00:59:10.75,">> PROBST: So Danni, what's going through your mind right"
819,00:59:12.96,00:59:12.96,now? You have a huge decision.
820,00:59:15.08,00:59:15.08,"Pick the right person, you're a millionaire."
821,00:59:17.29,00:59:17.29,"Pick the wrong person, you're $900,000 not as rich."
822,00:59:22.04,00:59:22.04,">> I mean, to be secure in the final two is amazing."
823,00:59:24.79,00:59:24.79,But you want to make sure you make the right decision.
824,00:59:27.25,00:59:27.25,"I mean, when you look at it one way, there's 10 million"
825,00:59:29.54,00:59:29.54,"different ways it's right. You look at the other way, it's"
826,00:59:32.25,00:59:32.25,10 million different ways it's right.
827,00:59:34.08,00:59:34.08,So it's so hard. >> PROBST: Give me one reason
828,00:59:36.12,00:59:36.12,why picking Rafe is the right choice.
829,00:59:38.17,00:59:38.17,">> Since the merge, he's really been an awesome friend to me and"
830,00:59:41.38,00:59:41.38,has helped me along so much in the game that I wouldn't be in
831,00:59:44.38,00:59:44.38,this position if it wasn't for him.
832,00:59:47.00,00:59:47.00,>> PROBST: Why would Steph be the right choice?
833,00:59:49.88,00:59:49.88,">> Well, she made a lot of people mad at her in the game"
834,00:59:52.67,00:59:52.67,and would be the easier choice if you wanted a better chance at
835,00:59:56.54,00:59:56.54,"winning the million. >> PROBST: Steph, when you"
836,00:59:59.21,00:59:59.21,"listen to Danni, what are you thinking inside?"
837,01:00:01.75,01:00:01.75,">> If she wants to stick with her heart, she will go with"
838,01:00:04.21,01:00:04.21,Rafe. But if she wants to guarantee
839,01:00:07.12,01:00:07.12,"herself a little bit of a better chance, she should take me."
840,01:00:11.54,01:00:11.54,Because I think that everybody on the jury thinks that Rafe's
841,01:00:15.46,01:00:15.46,more likable than me. So she's got a pretty tough
842,01:00:18.58,01:00:18.58,"decision to make. >> PROBST: Rafe, how about for"
843,01:00:21.04,01:00:21.04,you? >> I don't think that the jury
844,01:00:24.21,01:00:24.21,necessarily likes me a whole lot more than they like Steph
845,01:00:27.17,01:00:27.17,because I screwed over the same people.
846,01:00:30.46,01:00:30.46,( chuckles ) And they know it.
847,01:00:32.12,01:00:32.12,"You know, I think Danni is a person who almost all the way"
848,01:00:35.17,01:00:35.17,through this game has said she goes with her heart.
849,01:00:37.67,01:00:37.67,"So it is kind of nice to hear her say, ""If I go with my heart"
850,01:00:40.58,01:00:40.58,"tonight, I'll go with Rafe."" Because that's the way she"
851,01:00:43.12,01:00:43.12,played the game up until this point.
852,01:00:45.71,01:00:45.71,">> PROBST: Okay, here is how it works."
853,01:00:48.25,01:00:48.25,"Rafe, you cannot vote for Danni. You can only vote for Steph."
854,01:00:51.54,01:00:51.54,Steph cannot vote for Danni. She can only vote for Rafe.
855,01:00:53.88,01:00:53.88,Your votes cancel each other out.
856,01:00:55.83,01:00:55.83,The only person voting tonight is Danni.
857,01:00:58.21,01:00:58.21,"Danni, it's time to vote. >> PROBST: I'll go get the vote."
858,01:01:41.79,01:01:41.79,">> PROBST: Once the vote is read, the decision is final."
859,01:01:44.29,01:01:44.29,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
860,01:01:47.00,01:01:47.00,Council immediately. I'll read the vote.
861,01:01:53.42,01:01:53.42,16th person voted out of Survivor: Guatemala...
862,01:02:00.50,01:02:00.50,Rafe. Need to bring me your torch?
863,01:02:06.62,01:02:06.62,"( Rafe speaks softly ) >> PROBST: Rafe, the tribe has"
864,01:02:19.58,01:02:19.58,spoken. It's time for you to go.
865,01:02:23.29,01:02:23.29,">> Good luck tomorrow, guys. >> PROBST: Danni, you've clearly"
866,01:02:38.29,01:02:38.29,made your decision. You kept the person you think
867,01:02:40.92,01:02:40.92,you have the best chance of winning against.
868,01:02:43.00,01:02:43.00,The only thing left to do is see if you were right.
869,01:02:45.62,01:02:45.62,You'll have one more night in Guatemala.
870,01:02:47.50,01:02:47.50,You will return here tomorrow night for your final Tribal
871,01:02:49.50,01:02:49.50,Council. Grab your torches.
872,01:02:52.25,01:02:52.25,"Head out. >> Well, I feel like I played a"
873,01:02:59.67,01:02:59.67,"smart game, um, and as honest a game as I could."
874,01:03:02.71,01:03:02.71,"So, I am really proud of myself. I'm proud of what I did."
875,01:03:05.25,01:03:05.25,"You know, I stayed true to my moral compass and I betrayed"
876,01:03:08.25,01:03:08.25,people when I thought I should. And I stuck with people when I
877,01:03:11.83,01:03:11.83,"thought I should. Danni, I understand the decision"
878,01:03:14.54,01:03:14.54,"you made, and I thought you were the one person who would take me"
879,01:03:17.67,01:03:17.67,to the final two. And you didn't.
880,01:03:21.17,01:03:21.17,"So, Stephenie, I'm absolutely rooting for you."
881,01:03:23.88,01:03:23.88,"I think you played a great game. And, um, I will be voting for"
882,01:03:27.33,01:03:27.33,you tomorrow night. ( birds chirping )
883,01:03:42.96,01:03:42.96,( monkeys grunting ) ( monkeys grunting )
884,01:03:53.50,01:03:53.50,( Steph sighs ) >> Did you sleep?
885,01:03:55.71,01:03:55.71,>> I did. Did you? >> I tossed and turned quite a
886,01:03:58.12,01:03:58.12,"bit, but... >> Oh, my God."
887,01:03:59.96,01:03:59.96,>> Here we are in the final two. >> Danni and Steph are the final
888,01:04:02.71,01:04:02.71,two. Both names in yellow.
889,01:04:04.96,01:04:04.96,>> Yeah. I can't believe this.
890,01:04:08.38,01:04:08.38,>> It is day 39. Danni and I woke up this morning
891,01:04:12.96,01:04:12.96,with smiles on our faces 'cause last night was the last
892,01:04:15.58,01:04:15.58,night that we are sleeping in the Guatemalan jungle with all
893,01:04:19.12,01:04:19.12,these crazy creatures. ( monkey grunting )
894,01:04:22.04,01:04:22.04,>> I was the one who overcame every odd.
895,01:04:24.46,01:04:24.46,I was the one with the target on my back.
896,01:04:27.21,01:04:27.21,And then to get to the last day in the final two?
897,01:04:29.17,01:04:29.17,"You know, I'm really proud of myself."
898,01:04:31.04,01:04:31.04,"I can't believe I would ever, in a million years, be able to do"
899,01:04:34.08,01:04:34.08,that. >> This is it.
900,01:04:38.00,01:04:38.00,Last time to the pool. >> Yeah.
901,01:04:40.25,01:04:40.25,No more mosquitoes. >> Absolutely.
902,01:04:42.88,01:04:42.88,Stephenie and I are so much alike.
903,01:04:45.12,01:04:45.12,It's just so funny that we ended up together at the end.
904,01:04:47.21,01:04:47.21,"The two jocks, you know. And to outlast all the boys, you"
905,01:04:50.12,01:04:50.12,"know, it was kind of fun. Two tough girls."
906,01:04:57.96,01:04:57.96,">> For me, it was a lot of mind over matter out here."
907,01:05:00.50,01:05:00.50,"Again, if you are not strong- minded, you'll just collapse."
908,01:05:03.33,01:05:03.33,>> Sorry. Just leave it there.
909,01:05:06.08,01:05:06.08,>> I am so freakin' weak. >> Yeah.
910,01:05:07.88,01:05:07.88,">> Now, after this, I know for a fact there is nothing that's"
911,01:05:11.17,01:05:11.17,ever gonna stand in my way. >> Last time we have to wash our
912,01:05:19.75,01:05:19.75,clothes. Last bath.
913,01:05:23.71,01:05:23.71,>> Oh. >> Stephenie was the best
914,01:05:30.04,01:05:30.04,competitor. And to make it as far as she did
915,01:05:32.79,01:05:32.79,is tough. And she's definitely the
916,01:05:34.50,01:05:34.50,toughest competitor. I think it's great to go to the
917,01:05:36.92,01:05:36.92,final two against the toughest player.
918,01:05:38.71,01:05:38.71,>> You can't predict this game at all.
919,01:05:41.54,01:05:41.54,>> Everything happens for a reason.
920,01:05:44.25,01:05:44.25,>> Mm-hmm. >> I'm gonna miss Guatemala.
921,01:05:47.25,01:05:47.25,This has been a great experience.
922,01:05:49.04,01:05:49.04,"It's something not everybody gets a chance to do, obviously."
923,01:05:52.17,01:05:52.17,But it's been awesome. >> Should we get all of the
924,01:06:09.50,01:06:09.50,palm fronds out of the shelter and put them here?
925,01:06:12.46,01:06:12.46,>> I can't believe it. >> We figured because we're not
926,01:06:15.33,01:06:15.33,"gonna sleep here anymore, why don't we just start breaking"
927,01:06:18.54,01:06:18.54,down the shelter and just burn everything.
928,01:06:20.88,01:06:20.88,So we started to burn some of the pompoms.
929,01:06:23.25,01:06:23.25,Burning everything. Sacrificing everything for the
930,01:06:26.17,01:06:26.17,Mayan gods. >> We made it all the way.
931,01:06:32.33,01:06:32.33,That's the more the amazing thing.
932,01:06:37.25,01:06:37.25,>> I can't be happier with the way everything turned out.
933,01:06:40.04,01:06:40.04,I think everybody back home will be so proud of both of us.
934,01:06:43.00,01:06:43.00,>> To know you made it every day.
935,01:06:45.46,01:06:45.46,>> Right. >> It's such an amazing
936,01:06:49.33,01:06:49.33,accomplishment. >> I know.
937,01:06:51.42,01:06:51.42,">> No matter what situation in life you are in, you may be"
938,01:06:54.42,01:06:54.42,"down, but you are never out. That's a huge lesson I learned"
939,01:06:57.62,01:06:57.62,here. For the jury tonight I plan on
940,01:07:00.88,01:07:00.88,"being myself and try to be a nice person, the all-American"
941,01:07:04.58,01:07:04.58,girl next door. So it just kind of depends on
942,01:07:07.04,01:07:07.04,the questions they ask and how I need to react to it.
943,01:07:14.12,01:07:14.12,>> I did everything in my power to get me as far as I could in
944,01:07:17.71,01:07:17.71,this game. I don't know what the jury's
945,01:07:20.12,01:07:20.12,"gonna throw at me. But whatever they throw at me,"
946,01:07:22.29,01:07:22.29,I'm definitely going to have an answer.
947,01:07:24.29,01:07:24.29,"I mean, I have good reason for every move I made in this game."
948,01:07:29.04,01:07:29.04,"None of them are gonna scare me. Bottom line is I outwitted,"
949,01:07:32.21,01:07:32.21,outplayed and outlasted every single one of them.
950,01:07:34.46,01:07:34.46,And that's why I'm in the final two and they're not.
951,01:08:17.21,01:08:17.21,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the jury.
952,01:08:21.42,01:08:21.42,Bobby Jon. Jamie.
953,01:08:24.33,01:08:24.33,Gary. Judd.
954,01:08:27.12,01:08:27.12,Cindy. Lydia.
955,01:08:29.08,01:08:29.08,And Rafe. Voted out at the last Tribal
956,01:08:31.71,01:08:31.71,"Council. Danni, first things first."
957,01:08:36.17,01:08:36.17,You can take off your immunity necklace.
958,01:08:38.50,01:08:38.50,"You don't need it anymore. Well, congratulations on doing"
959,01:08:43.58,01:08:43.58,"what 16 other people could not do in this game, and that is"
960,01:08:47.08,01:08:47.08,make it to the final two. The jury composed of seven
961,01:08:50.29,01:08:50.29,people that you had a hand either directly or indirectly in
962,01:08:54.00,01:08:54.00,"voting out, now holds your fate in their hands."
963,01:08:56.79,01:08:56.79,And based on the answers that you give them to their questions
964,01:09:00.71,01:09:00.71,"tonight, they will decide which one of the two of you they think"
965,01:09:04.17,01:09:04.17,is most deserving of the title of Sole Survivor and the check
966,01:09:07.33,01:09:07.33,for a million dollars that goes with it.
967,01:09:09.50,01:09:09.50,Here is how it'll work. You two will have a chance to
968,01:09:12.12,01:09:12.12,"make opening statements, a chance to try to convince them"
969,01:09:15.21,01:09:15.21,why you are the most deserving. Then they will get their first
970,01:09:18.54,01:09:18.54,chance to address you with a question and a statement.
971,01:09:21.25,01:09:21.25,Then you will get a chance to make a closing comment.
972,01:09:24.42,01:09:24.42,And then we vote. Make sense?
973,01:09:26.67,01:09:26.67,>> Uh-huh. >> PROBST: Let's get started.
974,01:09:28.58,01:09:28.58,"Danni, opening statement. >> Okay, um..."
975,01:09:32.17,01:09:32.17,"Gosh, I don't know where to begin."
976,01:09:34.33,01:09:34.33,I just feel honored to be in this position.
977,01:09:37.21,01:09:37.21,Because making that merge from Yaxha over to Nakum and being in
978,01:09:41.38,01:09:41.38,"that numbers game, I thought there was no chance in heck that"
979,01:09:45.29,01:09:45.29,I would ever be sitting in this position.
980,01:09:47.88,01:09:47.88,And I was surprised that nobody really thought that I was a
981,01:09:51.67,01:09:51.67,threat. Because I do have a little bit
982,01:09:54.29,01:09:54.29,"of an athletic background, and I knew I couldn't be stopped when"
983,01:09:58.17,01:09:58.17,it came to endurance because I've overcome a couple of
984,01:10:01.04,01:10:01.04,hardships in my life that made me strong mentally.
985,01:10:04.17,01:10:04.17,"And I tried to play the game the best that I could, as honest"
986,01:10:07.58,01:10:07.58,that I could. And I just hope at the end of
987,01:10:10.12,01:10:10.12,"all this, after everything is done, that we'll be able to have"
988,01:10:13.67,01:10:13.67,you guys come to Kansas City and eat some good barbecue and go to
989,01:10:17.00,01:10:17.00,"a ball game. >> PROBST: Steph, opening"
990,01:10:21.12,01:10:21.12,"statement. >> Um, I just, I first want to"
991,01:10:26.54,01:10:26.54,start off by basically thanking all of you for making this an
992,01:10:30.21,01:10:30.21,"amazing, amazing experience for me."
993,01:10:32.38,01:10:32.38,I never thought coming into this Survivor that I would even
994,01:10:36.08,01:10:36.08,have a shot at making it past even the first Tribal Council.
995,01:10:39.62,01:10:39.62,"So, to be sitting in the final two next to Danni, I am"
996,01:10:43.04,01:10:43.04,completely honored. And I know that there are a few
997,01:10:46.46,01:10:46.46,people that are a little upset with me so I can't wait to talk
998,01:10:49.21,01:10:49.21,"to you, and I hope can I ease your mind a little bit."
999,01:10:51.71,01:10:51.71,I will be as honest as I have ever been.
1000,01:10:54.21,01:10:54.21,"You know, this has been a great ride, and I am glad I could have"
1001,01:10:57.42,01:10:57.42,experienced it with all of you. >> PROBST: All right.
1002,01:11:03.50,01:11:03.50,"Jury, in a moment you get your first chance to address Danni"
1003,01:11:06.17,01:11:06.17,and Steph. I'll give you a moment to think
1004,01:11:08.29,01:11:08.29,"about what you want to say. >> PROBST: Okay, jury."
1005,01:11:31.88,01:11:31.88,You've heard their opening statements.
1006,01:11:33.75,01:11:33.75,It's your turn now to address them with a question and/or
1007,01:11:36.38,01:11:36.38,"comment. Bobby Jon, you're up."
1008,01:11:40.17,01:11:40.17,>> How is it going? >> Good.
1009,01:11:42.04,01:11:42.04,">> Thanks. >> First of all, I want to say"
1010,01:11:44.42,01:11:44.42,"after a long 39 days or whatever, nobody can ever take"
1011,01:11:47.12,01:11:47.12,away from you for making it to the final two.
1012,01:11:49.50,01:11:49.50,>> Thank you. >> That's for certain.
1013,01:11:51.46,01:11:51.46,"Steph, I will start with you. I know the only reason I am"
1014,01:11:54.62,01:11:54.62,standing right here is because of you.
1015,01:11:56.67,01:11:56.67,So I do appreciate that. I really do.
1016,01:11:58.75,01:11:58.75,But my first question for you is how proud are you of yourself of
1017,01:12:02.83,01:12:02.83,"playing this game up until now? >> Actually, I am proud of the"
1018,01:12:06.79,01:12:06.79,way I played this game. I know there are two people in
1019,01:12:10.96,01:12:10.96,particular that I have sort of backstabbed.
1020,01:12:14.21,01:12:14.21,"And other than that, I have played the best game I know how"
1021,01:12:16.33,01:12:16.33,to play. I came into this game with a
1022,01:12:18.33,01:12:18.33,huge target on my back just like you did.
1023,01:12:20.58,01:12:20.58,>> Right. >> And there's nothing I regret.
1024,01:12:22.83,01:12:22.83,And there's nothing I'd take back that I did.
1025,01:12:25.04,01:12:25.04,">> Good answer. Danni, I guess the same thing."
1026,01:12:27.62,01:12:27.62,"I wanna ask you is up until now, are you proud of how you played"
1027,01:12:30.79,01:12:30.79,the game? >> I am.
1028,01:12:32.96,01:12:32.96,I'm happy with the way I played the game.
1029,01:12:36.12,01:12:36.12,And I was surprised at how long I stuck around and feel just
1030,01:12:40.25,01:12:40.25,grateful to be here. And the only thing I wish that
1031,01:12:43.00,01:12:43.00,could happen differently is that we would have won a few more of
1032,01:12:46.04,01:12:46.04,"those immunity challenges so when we merged over,"
1033,01:12:48.12,01:12:48.12,we would've... >> Right.
1034,01:12:49.96,01:12:49.96,>> Had our group together 'cause we had so much fun.
1035,01:12:53.38,01:12:53.38,">> That's all I got. >> PROBST: Thanks, Bobby Jon."
1036,01:12:56.17,01:12:56.17,>> Thanks. >> PROBST: Gary.
1037,01:13:00.21,01:13:00.21,>> I think this game is still going to be played until the
1038,01:13:03.96,01:13:03.96,last answer that you give tonight.
1039,01:13:06.08,01:13:06.08,So I'm gonna judge my vote tonight on who I think gives me
1040,01:13:10.75,01:13:10.75,"the most honest answers. Straight out, no garbage."
1041,01:13:14.17,01:13:14.17,I want to start with Steph first.
1042,01:13:16.92,01:13:16.92,I want to know why I should not vote for you tonight.
1043,01:13:19.79,01:13:19.79,>> Why you shouldn't? >> I guess the first thing was
1044,01:13:22.08,01:13:22.08,we made an alliance the first day.
1045,01:13:24.12,01:13:24.12,"And I said, you know, no matter what, we'll try to stick"
1046,01:13:27.17,01:13:27.17,together. And then we got separated and I
1047,01:13:29.42,01:13:29.42,"formed another alliance. And when you came over, you"
1048,01:13:32.79,01:13:32.79,"know, I didn't. I voted you out."
1049,01:13:34.58,01:13:34.58,"So, yeah, maybe there is a reason why maybe you shouldn't"
1050,01:13:37.12,01:13:37.12,vote for me. >> Okay.
1051,01:13:38.79,01:13:38.79,"Thank you. Danni, same question."
1052,01:13:42.04,01:13:42.04,">> First of all, I definitely had an alliance with you."
1053,01:13:46.62,01:13:46.62,"But also, I was aligning myself with Rafe."
1054,01:13:50.21,01:13:50.21,That was maybe the wrong thing to do.
1055,01:13:54.17,01:13:54.17,So I made a selfish move at that point.
1056,01:13:56.92,01:13:56.92,And that's one thing I'm never normally is selfish.
1057,01:13:59.71,01:13:59.71,But in this game you have to be at times.
1058,01:14:02.96,01:14:02.96,And that is the main reason. I'm sorry for that.
1059,01:14:06.25,01:14:06.25,>> Okay. Thank you very much.
1060,01:14:08.58,01:14:08.58,">> PROBST: Thank you, Gary. >> Thank you."
1061,01:14:11.04,01:14:11.04,>> PROBST: Jamie. >> What an adventure.
1062,01:14:18.79,01:14:18.79,( laughing ) I will say that.
1063,01:14:20.25,01:14:20.25,I will go to Danni first. I've always believed it is not
1064,01:14:23.21,01:14:23.21,where you go; it's who you go with.
1065,01:14:25.50,01:14:25.50,"My question to you is if you would have had numbers, who"
1066,01:14:29.71,01:14:29.71,would your top five been and why?
1067,01:14:32.00,01:14:32.00,">> Well, definitely, Bobby Jon and Gary."
1068,01:14:36.29,01:14:36.29,"Those two, and then Brandon. Definitely."
1069,01:14:38.33,01:14:38.33,Brandon and I had a good bond. If we would've had four of us
1070,01:14:41.12,01:14:41.12,"there together, something would have happened."
1071,01:14:43.29,01:14:43.29,But I would have liked for it to end up that way for sure.
1072,01:14:49.00,01:14:49.00,">> Okay. Stephenie, you get a little bit"
1073,01:14:52.33,01:14:52.33,of a tougher one. >> Thanks.
1074,01:14:54.21,01:14:54.21,>> My question to you is: I wouldn't talk to people if I was
1075,01:14:59.08,01:14:59.08,going to vote them out. I am not good with getting close
1076,01:15:01.62,01:15:01.62,"to people and letting them go. And with you, you'd be the best"
1077,01:15:04.17,01:15:04.17,friend till we were in Tribal Council.
1078,01:15:06.29,01:15:06.29,And then you'd vote them out. And my question is how do you
1079,01:15:09.71,01:15:09.71,"think the jury who has to decide, how do you think they"
1080,01:15:12.96,01:15:12.96,feel about that when they saw that?
1081,01:15:15.21,01:15:15.21,>> That's a good question. I'll start with you.
1082,01:15:18.17,01:15:18.17,"The day your name came up to get voted out, it was not my full"
1083,01:15:23.08,01:15:23.08,"decision. I mean, there was a group of us."
1084,01:15:25.46,01:15:25.46,"And I have a hard time saying to somebody, ""I'm voting you out."""
1085,01:15:29.12,01:15:29.12,"Because like you said, blind-sided is the best way to"
1086,01:15:32.38,01:15:32.38,go. So I would only hope those
1087,01:15:35.04,01:15:35.04,people will see I had really good reasons in doing so and
1088,01:15:38.50,01:15:38.50,they would respect my game and award me their vote because they
1089,01:15:42.12,01:15:42.12,think I am deserving of it. >> That's good to know.
1090,01:15:45.50,01:15:45.50,"Thank you. >> PROBST: Thanks, Jamie."
1091,01:15:49.25,01:15:49.25,"Lydia. >> Stephenie, I have been loyal"
1092,01:15:56.12,01:15:56.12,to you since day six of this game.
1093,01:15:58.79,01:15:58.79,>> I know. >> But you voted me out.
1094,01:16:00.79,01:16:00.79,"So, why should I vote for you tonight?"
1095,01:16:02.96,01:16:02.96,">> Actually, I want to thank you for being so loyal to me the"
1096,01:16:06.17,01:16:06.17,"entire game, Lydia, and you absolutely were."
1097,01:16:08.71,01:16:08.71,"Even though you and I had been together since day one, if I"
1098,01:16:11.75,01:16:11.75,"took you to the final, I would probably have a better shot of"
1099,01:16:14.67,01:16:14.67,"beating you than Danni. But then, what does that say for"
1100,01:16:17.17,01:16:17.17,me? Who is super-competitive and
1101,01:16:19.17,01:16:19.17,super-athletic. And I'm gonna take Lydia because
1102,01:16:21.17,01:16:21.17,"I think I can beat her? I mean, that's not what really"
1103,01:16:24.33,01:16:24.33,"competitive people do. So, I went up against the best"
1104,01:16:27.67,01:16:27.67,and I'd like to beat the best. And that's why I'm sitting next
1105,01:16:31.17,01:16:31.17,to her right now. >> Okay.
1106,01:16:33.88,01:16:33.88,"And question for Danni. Danni, you told me that ""I am"
1107,01:16:37.75,01:16:37.75,"going to take care of you. Trust me."""
1108,01:16:41.17,01:16:41.17,And I did. What happened?
1109,01:16:43.50,01:16:43.50,Why should I give you my vote? >> You totally could trust me.
1110,01:16:46.25,01:16:46.25,And remember I talked to you and let you know what I heard and
1111,01:16:49.12,01:16:49.12,you had let me know what you heard.
1112,01:16:51.33,01:16:51.33,And we kept those lines of communication completely open
1113,01:16:53.62,01:16:53.62,and honest. We are all here to win a
1114,01:16:56.25,01:16:56.25,million. But everybody's trying to come
1115,01:16:58.33,01:16:58.33,out the winner. And sometimes you're gonna have
1116,01:17:01.12,01:17:01.12,to do some lying or manipulating or something in part of the game
1117,01:17:04.88,01:17:04.88,to try to outwit. And sometimes you have to do
1118,01:17:07.33,01:17:07.33,that-- it is a game. >> Okay.
1119,01:17:09.58,01:17:09.58,">> PROBST: Thanks, Lydia. Cindy."
1120,01:17:18.29,01:17:18.29,>> I will do Danni first. If you could remove one of the
1121,01:17:22.54,01:17:22.54,"jury members, who would it be, and why would you want that"
1122,01:17:26.42,01:17:26.42,person eliminated from the jury? >> Definitely it would be Rafe
1123,01:17:30.96,01:17:30.96,because I know for sure he is voting for Stephenie because
1124,01:17:34.29,01:17:34.29,"they've had that bond since the very, very beginning."
1125,01:17:36.83,01:17:36.83,And of course you want to win. So that's who I would remove.
1126,01:17:40.21,01:17:40.21,">> That's pretty honest. Um, same thing for Stephenie."
1127,01:17:44.54,01:17:44.54,">> Oh, my God. I don't know."
1128,01:17:48.08,01:17:48.08,"If I had to take somebody off the jury, I guess it would be"
1129,01:17:51.00,01:17:51.00,Bobby Jon because he was the first one that made the jury.
1130,01:17:54.71,01:17:54.71,That's my answer. I don't know.
1131,01:17:56.25,01:17:56.25,I wouldn't want to take anybody out of the game.
1132,01:17:59.04,01:17:59.04,>> Okay. That sounds okay for me.
1133,01:18:01.71,01:18:01.71,">> PROBST: Thanks, Cindy. Rafe."
1134,01:18:09.79,01:18:09.79,">> Um, first off, congratulations on being the"
1135,01:18:12.08,01:18:12.08,final two. You two were really like sisters
1136,01:18:15.08,01:18:15.08,to me out here. And like I am proud that one of
1137,01:18:17.08,01:18:17.08,you is gonna win a million dollars tonight.
1138,01:18:19.12,01:18:19.12,"I'm gonna go with Danni first. You said, ""Rafe, if I ever get"
1139,01:18:22.33,01:18:22.33,in a situation where I am in the final three and I can take the
1140,01:18:25.96,01:18:25.96,person I think I'll beat over the person I think deserves to
1141,01:18:29.12,01:18:29.12,"win, I'll take the person I think deserves to win."""
1142,01:18:32.17,01:18:32.17,"So, I'm wondering what happened when you had that decision right"
1143,01:18:35.75,01:18:35.75,in front of you and made the opposite of what you said you
1144,01:18:39.12,01:18:39.12,"would make? >> Well, first of all, one thing"
1145,01:18:43.21,01:18:43.21,that changed my mind was during that immunity challenge
1146,01:18:46.17,01:18:46.17,"yesterday, I saw Stephenie over there crying, her legs shaking,"
1147,01:18:49.00,01:18:49.00,"giving everything she could. She said, ""I'm not stopping"
1148,01:18:51.46,01:18:51.46,"until I pass out."" And I felt like somebody who"
1149,01:18:54.04,01:18:54.04,came into the game who had a target on their back from the
1150,01:18:57.21,01:18:57.21,very beginning who fought through all the odds shows
1151,01:19:00.29,01:19:00.29,that she really is the best player.
1152,01:19:02.29,01:19:02.29,"I mean, she knows how to play the game."
1153,01:19:04.83,01:19:04.83,"So, I mean, it's a toss-up between who was the strongest"
1154,01:19:07.17,01:19:07.17,between the two. Or even who's the most
1155,01:19:09.33,01:19:09.33,deserving. Because I think either one of
1156,01:19:11.58,01:19:11.58,you would be just as deserving. >> Okay.
1157,01:19:13.75,01:19:13.75,That's good. I wanted to understand why that
1158,01:19:16.04,01:19:16.04,decision changed. And I think you answered that.
1159,01:19:18.42,01:19:18.42,"Steph, I think that you have kind of given a clear reason why"
1160,01:19:23.29,01:19:23.29,you should win this game is that you dominated it in terms of
1161,01:19:26.62,01:19:26.62,strategy. You were the reason that a lot
1162,01:19:29.17,01:19:29.17,"of people were voted out. And I, as a competitor really"
1163,01:19:31.67,01:19:31.67,respect that. And I was the one who knew it
1164,01:19:34.04,01:19:34.04,most because we talked strategy all the time with each other.
1165,01:19:36.50,01:19:36.50,What I am interested to hear from you is what you think the
1166,01:19:39.54,01:19:39.54,best strategic decision or move you made in the game was that
1167,01:19:42.75,01:19:42.75,you didn't tell me about. >> Hmm.
1168,01:19:47.79,01:19:47.79,I honestly do not think there was one.
1169,01:19:50.38,01:19:50.38,You are the only person I was completely honest with in this
1170,01:19:53.04,01:19:53.04,entire game. >> Okay.
1171,01:19:54.75,01:19:54.75,"Steph, I really would like to know why you think you should"
1172,01:19:57.21,01:19:57.21,beat the other person in your closing comments.
1173,01:19:59.29,01:19:59.29,Like why you think you should win.
1174,01:20:01.62,01:20:01.62,">> Okay. Thanks, Rafe."
1175,01:20:03.71,01:20:03.71,">> Thanks. >> PROBST: Thanks, Rafe."
1176,01:20:06.21,01:20:06.21,"Judd. >> First of all, I want to"
1177,01:20:12.50,01:20:12.50,congratulate you. Good job well done.
1178,01:20:14.71,01:20:14.71,"First, Danni. I want to know if you've ever"
1179,01:20:18.17,01:20:18.17,went roller-blading or ice skating before?
1180,01:20:21.33,01:20:21.33,>> Roller-blading or ice skating?
1181,01:20:23.25,01:20:23.25,>> Have you ever ice skated or roller-bladed before?
1182,01:20:25.58,01:20:25.58,">> I've done both, yes. Not very well."
1183,01:20:28.25,01:20:28.25,>> I think you're one of the best ice skaters I've ever seen.
1184,01:20:30.83,01:20:30.83,'Cause I believe your strategy was to just skate right through
1185,01:20:34.08,01:20:34.08,this damn game like you did. The second question is were you
1186,01:20:38.08,01:20:38.08,deceitful? Were you a backstabber?
1187,01:20:40.71,01:20:40.71,"Were you a liar? >> The one time that I did lie,"
1188,01:20:45.42,01:20:45.42,Jamie came up and asked me who I was going to be voting for that
1189,01:20:51.29,01:20:51.29,night. And I told him I would put
1190,01:20:53.29,01:20:53.29,"Gary's name down. So, I lied in that situation."
1191,01:20:56.21,01:20:56.21,"And another time Brian asked me, ""Who are you gonna vote for?"
1192,01:20:58.50,01:20:58.50,"Who are you gonna vote for?"" And I just plain flat told him I"
1193,01:21:01.17,01:21:01.17,didn't know just because I didn't want to be there to be
1194,01:21:03.29,01:21:03.29,much confrontation. >> To me it sounds like you just
1195,01:21:05.96,01:21:05.96,lied a lot. So I would suggest when you get
1196,01:21:08.38,01:21:08.38,"back home, first thing you do is go to confession."
1197,01:21:10.96,01:21:10.96,">> You know, it's funny, Judd. Because I do ask forgiveness"
1198,01:21:14.54,01:21:14.54,every day because it's not just lying everyday that we do.
1199,01:21:18.08,01:21:18.08,"Believe me, I do ask forgiveness."
1200,01:21:20.12,01:21:20.12,I ask forgiveness everyday about everything.
1201,01:21:23.04,01:21:23.04,">> Good answer. Steph, I want to know if you are"
1202,01:21:27.29,01:21:27.29,still starving? >> I'm starving.
1203,01:21:29.67,01:21:29.67,">> I mean, you have eaten more than I have eaten when I'm home."
1204,01:21:33.12,01:21:33.12,I have been to three immunities and all you sit there and say is
1205,01:21:35.62,01:21:35.62,"you're starving. I'm like, starving?"
1206,01:21:37.21,01:21:37.21,This girl won four challenges. >> I love to eat and you know
1207,01:21:39.71,01:21:39.71,"that. >> Well, the only thing you"
1208,01:21:41.88,01:21:41.88,"should be starving for right now is my damn vote, man."
1209,01:21:44.12,01:21:44.12,">> And I am, Judd. >> Basically, your strategy in"
1210,01:21:47.17,01:21:47.17,"this game was just to backstab, man, and lie and be deceitful."
1211,01:21:49.75,01:21:49.75,">> That's not true. >> Everybody that walked by you,"
1212,01:21:51.75,01:21:51.75,"man. You backstabbed this one,"
1213,01:21:54.12,01:21:54.12,"that one, that one, that one. I think you backstabbed"
1214,01:21:56.33,01:21:56.33,"everybody in this game. >> No, I didn't."
1215,01:21:58.12,01:21:58.12,">> But you crossed the line, man, when you lied to my wife,"
1216,01:22:00.67,01:22:00.67,"man, and you said that we have the strongest alliance here, and"
1217,01:22:03.12,01:22:03.12,"that was crossing the damn line, man, and you should've just"
1218,01:22:05.46,01:22:05.46,"never opened your damn mouth, man, when my wife got there, so"
1219,01:22:08.25,01:22:08.25,"not only did you lie to me, man, you lied to my wife, and that's"
1220,01:22:11.08,01:22:11.08,pretty brutal. And I'm gonna promise you
1221,01:22:13.17,01:22:13.17,something tonight and I'm gonna stick to my promise.
1222,01:22:16.04,01:22:16.04,">> Judd, can I respond to that or do you not want a response?"
1223,01:22:19.00,01:22:19.00,>> Of course. Absolutely.
1224,01:22:20.75,01:22:20.75,">> Um, I actually didn't lie to Kristin."
1225,01:22:23.04,01:22:23.04,We had a strong alliance. I planned on going to the end
1226,01:22:25.29,01:22:25.29,"with you. >> Yeah, but you lied to her."
1227,01:22:27.50,01:22:27.50,>> I wasn't lying at that point.
1228,01:22:29.50,01:22:29.50,">> How's that not a lie? Evidentially, you're there and"
1229,01:22:31.79,01:22:31.79,I'm here. So you lied.
1230,01:22:33.75,01:22:33.75,>> I had no idea I was going to vote you out.
1231,01:22:36.17,01:22:36.17,"It wasn't my idea. Listen, first of all, Danni came"
1232,01:22:39.21,01:22:39.21,"to Rafe and I said, ""I just want you guys to know that Judd was"
1233,01:22:43.88,01:22:43.88,"trying to get Rafe and then me."" >> Yeah, but I never told"
1234,01:22:48.21,01:22:48.21,anybody about I was targeting you or Rafe.
1235,01:22:51.25,01:22:51.25,They came up to me and asked who was the biggest threat and all's
1236,01:22:54.08,01:22:54.08,"I said to them was, ""Wow, man, you shouldn't be in this damn"
1237,01:22:56.67,01:22:56.67,"game if you know who the biggest threat is."""
1238,01:22:58.96,01:22:58.96,But I like your answers. Thank you.
1239,01:23:01.00,01:23:01.00,>> All right. I'm sorry.
1240,01:23:06.29,01:23:06.29,>> PROBST: I've got to say after 39 days out here with the level
1241,01:23:09.88,01:23:09.88,"of competitors that are in this game, the way they handled you"
1242,01:23:13.25,01:23:13.25,"guys tonight, I don't think you can ask more from a jury."
1243,01:23:16.54,01:23:16.54,So you do have one last chance to convince these guys of why
1244,01:23:20.12,01:23:20.12,you deserve the million dollars. I'm gonna give you a minute to
1245,01:23:23.08,01:23:23.08,think about it. >> PROBST: Okay.
1246,01:23:44.21,01:23:44.21,"You heard from the jury, very candid jury."
1247,01:23:46.38,01:23:46.38,Good questions. Asked you to be honest.
1248,01:23:49.58,01:23:49.58,You know what they want to hear. They want to hear why you
1249,01:23:52.33,01:23:52.33,deserve it. Closing statements.
1250,01:23:55.00,01:23:55.00,"Steph, you're first. >> Okay."
1251,01:23:57.50,01:23:57.50,I just want to thank all you guys for your questions and
1252,01:24:00.21,01:24:00.21,"comments and now I'd like to prove to you why I think, um, I"
1253,01:24:03.21,01:24:03.21,"deserve your vote. First of all, I think the game"
1254,01:24:06.17,01:24:06.17,"Survivor is, um, it's the hardest game anyone will ever"
1255,01:24:10.08,01:24:10.08,"play, and, you know, it's gonna bring out some of the worst"
1256,01:24:13.79,01:24:13.79,qualities in people. But it doesn't mean that we're
1257,01:24:16.33,01:24:16.33,bad people. And I know that I hurt a few
1258,01:24:19.12,01:24:19.12,people along the way and I sincerely do apologize.
1259,01:24:21.75,01:24:21.75,But the fact is I came to this game with a plan and it was to
1260,01:24:25.17,01:24:25.17,ally myself with great people and to try to always have the
1261,01:24:28.21,01:24:28.21,numbers on my side and to stay completely calm at all times.
1262,01:24:31.58,01:24:31.58,I never let anybody make decisions for me.
1263,01:24:36.25,01:24:36.25,"You know, fortunately, or unfortunately, I had to take a"
1264,01:24:38.96,01:24:38.96,"leadership role in this game, and I think that I outwitted and"
1265,01:24:44.58,01:24:44.58,"outplayed and outlasted the best that I knew how to, and that's"
1266,01:24:48.00,01:24:48.00,why I am sitting here in the final two and that's why I would
1267,01:24:50.67,01:24:50.67,be honored to have your votes as the Sole Survivor.
1268,01:24:56.08,01:24:56.08,">> PROBST: Danni? >> Um, I came into a merge with"
1269,01:25:00.25,01:25:00.25,"this top, you know, six alliance targeting me."
1270,01:25:04.46,01:25:04.46,"I thought my head was on the chopping block, and I didn't"
1271,01:25:06.96,01:25:06.96,want to scramble too soon. I wanted to... to sit back and
1272,01:25:09.25,01:25:09.25,"see who was in control of the game, and it was clear Stephanie"
1273,01:25:12.12,01:25:12.12,and Rafe were completely in control of the game and they're
1274,01:25:14.62,01:25:14.62,the reason why each one of you guys are sitting up there right
1275,01:25:17.33,01:25:17.33,"now. And I thought, ""You know what?"
1276,01:25:19.92,01:25:19.92,"I'm gonna try to align with the strongest,"" and we ended up"
1277,01:25:22.62,01:25:22.62,"becoming friends. I mean, I really got along with"
1278,01:25:25.38,01:25:25.38,"them great, and ended up getting that bond, because otherwise, I"
1279,01:25:28.71,01:25:28.71,would have been gone. So I feel I really did outwit
1280,01:25:31.92,01:25:31.92,"and I definitely outlasted. And, um, I would appreciate"
1281,01:25:35.75,01:25:35.75,"your, uh, your vote tonight, absolutely."
1282,01:25:39.04,01:25:39.04,"And, like I said, there's no reason why I should say I"
1283,01:25:41.21,01:25:41.21,"deserve a million dollars over anybody else, but it'll"
1284,01:25:43.62,01:25:43.62,"definitely go to good use. >> PROBST: Okay, let's get to"
1285,01:25:46.04,01:25:46.04,"the vote. Tonight, you want to see your"
1286,01:25:49.88,01:25:49.88,"name on the parchment. Tonight, the jury is voting for"
1287,01:25:52.67,01:25:52.67,a winner-- the person they think most deserving of the title of
1288,01:25:56.17,01:25:56.17,Sole Survivor and a million dollars.
1289,01:25:59.17,01:25:59.17,For the last time it is time to vote.
1290,01:26:02.29,01:26:02.29,"Bobby Jon, you are up. >> ( whispering ): I always kept"
1291,01:26:25.92,01:26:25.92,"my promises, you never did. I promise I ain't voting for"
1292,01:26:28.42,01:26:28.42,you. >> ( whispering ): This game is
1293,01:26:46.83,01:26:46.83,about who you are. Your character is your strategy.
1294,01:26:49.75,01:26:49.75,"And Stephanie, you made the most of your strengths and you turned"
1295,01:26:53.12,01:26:53.12,your weaknesses into strengths out here.
1296,01:26:55.58,01:26:55.58,You are the ultimate Survivor. >> PROBST: I'll go get the
1297,01:27:15.38,01:27:15.38,votes. >> PROBST: Congratulations on
