402,00:27:54.50,00:27:54.50,>> I don't know.It is like they just came and
403,00:27:57.21,00:27:57.21,sacrificed it.So I felt like for me to eat the
404,00:28:00.29,00:28:00.29,chicken would just be totallypointless and I would lose
405,00:28:03.25,00:28:03.25,everything that I learned fromthe ritual because the ritual
406,00:28:07.21,00:28:07.21,was about not eating thechicken.

573,00:41:09.75,00:41:09.75,the match.I think back and wonder what did

622,00:44:40.25,00:44:40.25,Today's immunity challenge willrequire balance and intense
623,00:44:44.92,00:44:44.92,concentration.Here is how it works.
624,00:44:48.12,00:44:48.12,You must balance on a wobblyplatform for as long as you can.
625,00:44:52.88,00:44:52.88,"The platform swivels 360degrees, offers very little"
626,00:44:57.17,00:44:57.17,"stability.For the first hour, you will"
627,00:44:59.42,00:44:59.42,have the aid of two ropes--one for each hand.
628,00:45:03.25,00:45:03.25,"That will help you find yourcenter of balance, get"
629,00:45:05.25,00:45:05.25,"comfortable with the platform.After one hour, you will release"
630,00:45:07.58,00:45:07.58,one rope.This is when it becomes more
631,00:45:09.92,00:45:09.92,difficult.You still have one rope to hold
632,00:45:12.25,00:45:12.25,onto.If after 30 minutes you are
633,00:45:14.58,00:45:14.58,"still hanging on, you'll releasethe second rope, and you'll go"
634,00:45:17.96,00:45:17.96,it alone.The person left standing wins
635,00:45:20.88,00:45:20.88,"immunity, guaranteed a spot inthe final two, and as"
636,00:45:24.04,00:45:24.04,"importantly, will decide whogoes with them to that final"
637,00:45:27.67,00:45:27.67,Tribal Council-- who sits acrossfrom that jury with a million
638,00:45:30.00,00:45:30.00,dollars on the line.I know it's worth playing for.
639,00:45:32.17,00:45:32.17,We'll draw for spots and getstarted.
640,00:45:39.54,00:45:39.54,"Okay, everybody, leap up.Land your feet on the platform."
641,00:45:44.71,00:45:44.71,This challenge has begun.We're going one hour with both
642,00:45:49.04,00:45:49.04,ropes.That swivel is very sensitive.
643,00:46:17.54,00:46:17.54,>> PROBST: 20 minutes.>> Left?

654,00:47:28.17,00:47:28.17,are not out until your feet hitthe base of the platform.

750,00:55:29.71,00:55:29.71,"you.Because, I mean, everybody loves"
751,00:55:31.75,00:55:31.75,"Rafe.And then, you know, you were so"
752,00:55:34.21,00:55:34.21,"tight with that group.But they, uh, you know, they"
753,00:55:36.96,00:55:36.96,tend to forget all that stuff.>> I think I have a 50-50 chance
754,00:55:41.12,00:55:41.12,right now.I have no idea what Danni's
755,00:55:43.08,00:55:43.08,gonna do at this point.And if she decides to bring Rafe
756,00:55:45.96,00:55:45.96,"to the final two then, you knowwhat, I played the best game I"
757,00:55:49.08,00:55:49.08,know how to play.And I'm not gonna be ashamed of
758,00:55:51.00,00:55:51.00,"that.>> Stephenie, I really don't"
759,00:55:53.12,00:55:53.12,know.>> I know.
760,00:55:55.71,00:55:55.71,"Why don't you just go with yourheart, you know, when you get"
761,00:55:57.96,00:55:57.96,there.Go with it.
762,00:56:00.17,00:56:00.17,">> Oh, God.I am still really torn between"
763,00:56:03.88,00:56:03.88,"Rafe and Stephenie.You know, I am competing for a"
764,00:56:06.17,00:56:06.17,"million dollars, you know, andyou have to really think about"
765,00:56:08.71,00:56:08.71,what you're gonna do here atthe final two.
766,00:56:10.79,00:56:10.79,And it's so hard.It's such a hard decision.
767,00:56:12.96,00:56:12.96,"But, you know, you're here towin."
768,00:56:16.79,00:56:16.79,It's definitely going to be agame time decision.
769,00:56:19.08,00:56:19.08,I'm not gonna be ready until Ihave to walk up there and write
770,00:56:22.12,00:56:22.12,a name down tonight.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
771,00:56:50.62,00:56:50.62,the members of the jury.Bobby Jon.
772,00:56:54.21,00:56:54.21,Jamie.Gary.
773,00:56:59.17,00:56:59.17,Judd.Cindy.
774,00:57:01.46,00:57:01.46,"And Lydia, voted out at the lastTribal Council."
775,00:57:10.12,00:57:10.12,"So... Rafe, Danni, Steph.The last Tribal Council, after"
776,00:57:16.54,00:57:16.54,"weeks of voting out thestrongest, just when you are on"
777,00:57:20.25,00:57:20.25,"the cusp of your last challenge,you vote out not one of the"
778,00:57:24.54,00:57:24.54,"strongest, but the weakest.And for two of you, it could be"
779,00:57:28.42,00:57:28.42,"a million dollar mistake.Steph, any regrets looking at"
780,00:57:31.08,00:57:31.08,Lydia over there?>> I don't.
781,00:57:33.12,00:57:33.12,"I mean, I didn't know if today'schallenge was gonna be"
782,00:57:35.54,00:57:35.54,completely physical orcompletely mental.
783,00:57:37.25,00:57:37.25,"So, it could have gone eitherway."
784,00:57:39.33,00:57:39.33,>> PROBST: But wait.Let's hold off on that.
785,00:57:41.38,00:57:41.38,"In 95% of the challenges, Rafe,Danni, Steph, Lydia's gonna be"
786,00:57:45.79,00:57:45.79,"the weak person.>> Well, the only chance I had"
787,00:57:49.12,00:57:49.12,was to tie it up at the lastTribal Council.
788,00:57:51.75,00:57:51.75,Because Rafe already gave Dannihis word and he wasn't changing
789,00:57:54.21,00:57:54.21,his vote.But that still wouldn't have
790,00:57:55.96,00:57:55.96,even guaranteed Lydia stayinghere.
791,00:57:57.58,00:57:57.58,"So you know what, go against thebest."
792,00:58:00.12,00:58:00.12,"And if she beats me fair andsquare, she beats me fair and"
793,00:58:03.00,00:58:03.00,"square and she deserves it.>> PROBST: Danni, did you ever"
794,00:58:07.21,00:58:07.21,imagine a guaranteed spot in thefinal two and you decide who's
795,00:58:10.75,00:58:10.75,gonna sit next to you?>> I am so blown away that I am
796,00:58:13.42,00:58:13.42,in this position.I can't believe I won immunity
797,00:58:15.54,00:58:15.54,today.I went back to camp and I'm just
798,00:58:18.21,00:58:18.21,"like, ""Did that really happen?""I mean, I cannot believe that"
799,00:58:21.25,00:58:21.25,I'm still here.It was an absolute miracle.
800,00:58:23.38,00:58:23.38,">> PROBST: Steph, you were veryemotional when you finally went"
801,00:58:26.12,00:58:26.12,down.>> It was such a tough
802,00:58:28.25,00:58:28.25,challenge.I was in so much pain and I just
803,00:58:31.00,00:58:31.00,"felt like a failure.You know, I went until I"
804,00:58:33.29,00:58:33.29,collapsed and I just sat thereand pretty much just cried for a
805,00:58:37.21,00:58:37.21,"couple minutes.>> PROBST: Rafe, you said"
806,00:58:39.21,00:58:39.21,something to Danni right afterthe challenge.
807,00:58:41.54,00:58:41.54,I caught a couple of words.>> Yeah. Danni had promised me a
808,00:58:44.12,00:58:44.12,long time ago that if I couldsomehow get her to the final
809,00:58:46.83,00:58:46.83,"three and she won the challenge,she'd take me to the final two."
810,00:58:50.25,00:58:50.25,"And so, I told Danni, ""I releaseyou from the promise."""
811,00:58:54.12,00:58:54.12,>> PROBST: Why would you dothat?
812,00:58:56.04,00:58:56.04,It sounds like you puteverything on today's challenge
813,00:58:59.08,00:58:59.08,and nothing on the past 37 days.>> I am saying forget about that
814,00:59:02.38,00:59:02.38,one promise that you made and ifyou think that I'm worthy of
815,00:59:05.62,00:59:05.62,"going to the final two, thentake me to the final two."
816,00:59:08.25,00:59:08.25,"If you think it's Steph, thentake Steph."
817,00:59:10.75,00:59:10.75,">> PROBST: So Danni, what'sgoing through your mind right"
818,00:59:12.96,00:59:12.96,now?You have a huge decision.
819,00:59:15.08,00:59:15.08,"Pick the right person, you're amillionaire."
820,00:59:17.29,00:59:17.29,"Pick the wrong person, you're$900,000 not as rich."
821,00:59:22.04,00:59:22.04,">> I mean, to be secure in thefinal two is amazing."
822,00:59:24.79,00:59:24.79,But you want to make sure youmake the right decision.
823,00:59:27.25,00:59:27.25,"I mean, when you look at it oneway, there's 10 million"
824,00:59:29.54,00:59:29.54,"different ways it's right.You look at the other way, it's"
825,00:59:32.25,00:59:32.25,10 million different ways it'sright.
826,00:59:34.08,00:59:34.08,So it's so hard.>> PROBST: Give me one reason
827,00:59:36.12,00:59:36.12,why picking Rafe is the rightchoice.
828,00:59:38.17,00:59:38.17,">> Since the merge, he's reallybeen an awesome friend to me and"
829,00:59:41.38,00:59:41.38,has helped me along so much inthe game that I wouldn't be in
830,00:59:44.38,00:59:44.38,this position if it wasn't forhim.
831,00:59:47.00,00:59:47.00,>> PROBST: Why would Steph bethe right choice?
832,00:59:49.88,00:59:49.88,">> Well, she made a lot ofpeople mad at her in the game"
833,00:59:52.67,00:59:52.67,and would be the easier choiceif you wanted a better chance at
834,00:59:56.54,00:59:56.54,"winning the million.>> PROBST: Steph, when you"
835,00:59:59.21,00:59:59.21,"listen to Danni, what are youthinking inside?"
836,01:00:01.75,01:00:01.75,">> If she wants to stick withher heart, she will go with"
837,01:00:04.21,01:00:04.21,Rafe.But if she wants to guarantee
838,01:00:07.12,01:00:07.12,"herself a little bit of a betterchance, she should take me."
839,01:00:11.54,01:00:11.54,Because I think that everybodyon the jury thinks that Rafe's
840,01:00:15.46,01:00:15.46,more likable than me.So she's got a pretty tough
841,01:00:18.58,01:00:18.58,"decision to make.>> PROBST: Rafe, how about for"
842,01:00:21.04,01:00:21.04,you?>> I don't think that the jury
843,01:00:24.21,01:00:24.21,necessarily likes me a whole lotmore than they like Steph
844,01:00:27.17,01:00:27.17,because I screwed over the samepeople.
845,01:00:30.46,01:00:30.46,( chuckles )And they know it.
846,01:00:32.12,01:00:32.12,"You know, I think Danni is aperson who almost all the way"
847,01:00:35.17,01:00:35.17,through this game has said shegoes with her heart.
848,01:00:37.67,01:00:37.67,"So it is kind of nice to hearher say, ""If I go with my heart"
849,01:00:40.58,01:00:40.58,"tonight, I'll go with Rafe.""Because that's the way she"
850,01:00:43.12,01:00:43.12,played the game up until thispoint.
851,01:00:45.71,01:00:45.71,">> PROBST: Okay, here is how itworks."
852,01:00:48.25,01:00:48.25,"Rafe, you cannot vote for Danni.You can only vote for Steph."
853,01:00:51.54,01:00:51.54,Steph cannot vote for Danni.She can only vote for Rafe.
854,01:00:53.88,01:00:53.88,Your votes cancel each otherout.
855,01:00:55.83,01:00:55.83,The only person voting tonightis Danni.
856,01:00:58.21,01:00:58.21,"Danni, it's time to vote.>> PROBST: I'll go get the vote."
857,01:01:41.79,01:01:41.79,">> PROBST: Once the vote isread, the decision is final."
858,01:01:44.29,01:01:44.29,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
859,01:01:47.00,01:01:47.00,Council immediately.I'll read the vote.
860,01:01:53.42,01:01:53.42,16th person voted out ofSurvivor: Guatemala...
861,01:02:00.50,01:02:00.50,Rafe.Need to bring me your torch?
862,01:02:06.62,01:02:06.62,"( Rafe speaks softly )>> PROBST: Rafe, the tribe has"
863,01:02:19.58,01:02:19.58,spoken.It's time for you to go.
864,01:02:23.29,01:02:23.29,">> Good luck tomorrow, guys.>> PROBST: Danni, you've clearly"
865,01:02:38.29,01:02:38.29,made your decision.You kept the person you think
866,01:02:40.92,01:02:40.92,you have the best chance ofwinning against.
867,01:02:43.00,01:02:43.00,The only thing left to do is seeif you were right.
868,01:02:45.62,01:02:45.62,You'll have one more night inGuatemala.
869,01:02:47.50,01:02:47.50,You will return here tomorrownight for your final Tribal

871,01:02:52.25,01:02:52.25,"Head out.>> Well, I feel like I played a"
872,01:02:59.67,01:02:59.67,"smart game, um, and as honest agame as I could."
873,01:03:02.71,01:03:02.71,"So, I am really proud of myself.I'm proud of what I did."
874,01:03:05.25,01:03:05.25,"You know, I stayed true to mymoral compass and I betrayed"
875,01:03:08.25,01:03:08.25,people when I thought I should.And I stuck with people when I
876,01:03:11.83,01:03:11.83,"thought I should.Danni, I understand the decision"
877,01:03:14.54,01:03:14.54,"you made, and I thought you werethe one person who would take me"
878,01:03:17.67,01:03:17.67,to the final two.And you didn't.
879,01:03:21.17,01:03:21.17,"So, Stephenie, I'm absolutelyrooting for you."
880,01:03:23.88,01:03:23.88,"I think you played a great game.And, um, I will be voting for"
881,01:03:27.33,01:03:27.33,you tomorrow night.( birds chirping )

885,01:03:58.12,01:03:58.12,"bit, but...>> Oh, my God."
886,01:03:59.96,01:03:59.96,>> Here we are in the final two.>> Danni and Steph are the final
887,01:04:02.71,01:04:02.71,two.Both names in yellow.
888,01:04:04.96,01:04:04.96,>> Yeah.I can't believe this.
889,01:04:08.38,01:04:08.38,>> It is day 39.Danni and I woke up this morning
890,01:04:12.96,01:04:12.96,with smiles on our faces'cause last night was the last
891,01:04:15.58,01:04:15.58,night that we are sleeping inthe Guatemalan jungle with all

894,01:04:24.46,01:04:24.46,I was the one with the target onmy back.
895,01:04:27.21,01:04:27.21,And then to get to the last dayin the final two?
896,01:04:29.17,01:04:29.17,"You know, I'm really proud ofmyself."
897,01:04:31.04,01:04:31.04,"I can't believe I would ever, ina million years, be able to do"
898,01:04:34.08,01:04:34.08,that.>> This is it.
899,01:04:38.00,01:04:38.00,Last time to the pool.>> Yeah.
900,01:04:40.25,01:04:40.25,No more mosquitoes.>> Absolutely.
901,01:04:42.88,01:04:42.88,Stephenie and I are so muchalike.
902,01:04:45.12,01:04:45.12,It's just so funny that we endedup together at the end.
903,01:04:47.21,01:04:47.21,"The two jocks, you know.And to outlast all the boys, you"
904,01:04:50.12,01:04:50.12,"know, it was kind of fun.Two tough girls."
905,01:04:57.96,01:04:57.96,">> For me, it was a lot of mindover matter out here."
906,01:05:00.50,01:05:00.50,"Again, if you are not strong-minded, you'll just collapse."
907,01:05:03.33,01:05:03.33,>> Sorry.Just leave it there.
908,01:05:06.08,01:05:06.08,>> I am so freakin' weak.>> Yeah.
909,01:05:07.88,01:05:07.88,">> Now, after this, I know for afact there is nothing that's"
910,01:05:11.17,01:05:11.17,ever gonna stand in my way.>> Last time we have to wash our
911,01:05:19.75,01:05:19.75,clothes.Last bath.
912,01:05:23.71,01:05:23.71,>> Oh.>> Stephenie was the best
913,01:05:30.04,01:05:30.04,competitor.And to make it as far as she did
914,01:05:32.79,01:05:32.79,is tough.And she's definitely the
915,01:05:34.50,01:05:34.50,toughest competitor.I think it's great to go to the
916,01:05:36.92,01:05:36.92,final two against the toughestplayer.
917,01:05:38.71,01:05:38.71,>> You can't predict this gameat all.
918,01:05:41.54,01:05:41.54,>> Everything happens for areason.
919,01:05:44.25,01:05:44.25,>> Mm-hmm.>> I'm gonna miss Guatemala.
920,01:05:47.25,01:05:47.25,This has been a greatexperience.
921,01:05:49.04,01:05:49.04,"It's something not everybodygets a chance to do, obviously."
922,01:05:52.17,01:05:52.17,But it's been awesome.>> Should we get all of the
923,01:06:09.50,01:06:09.50,palm fronds out of theshelter and put them here?
924,01:06:12.46,01:06:12.46,>> I can't believe it.>> We figured because we're not
925,01:06:15.33,01:06:15.33,"gonna sleep here anymore, whydon't we just start breaking"
926,01:06:18.54,01:06:18.54,down the shelter and just burneverything.
927,01:06:20.88,01:06:20.88,So we started to burn some ofthe pompoms.
928,01:06:23.25,01:06:23.25,Burning everything.Sacrificing everything for the
929,01:06:26.17,01:06:26.17,Mayan gods.>> We made it all the way.
930,01:06:32.33,01:06:32.33,That's the more the amazingthing.
931,01:06:37.25,01:06:37.25,>> I can't be happier with theway everything turned out.
932,01:06:40.04,01:06:40.04,I think everybody back home willbe so proud of both of us.
933,01:06:43.00,01:06:43.00,>> To know you made it everyday.
934,01:06:45.46,01:06:45.46,>> Right.>> It's such an amazing
935,01:06:49.33,01:06:49.33,accomplishment.>> I know.
936,01:06:51.42,01:06:51.42,">> No matter what situation inlife you are in, you may be"
937,01:06:54.42,01:06:54.42,"down, but you are never out.That's a huge lesson I learned"
938,01:06:57.62,01:06:57.62,here.For the jury tonight I plan on
939,01:07:00.88,01:07:00.88,"being myself and try to be anice person, the all-American"
940,01:07:04.58,01:07:04.58,girl next door.So it just kind of depends on
941,01:07:07.04,01:07:07.04,the questions they ask and how Ineed to react to it.
942,01:07:14.12,01:07:14.12,>> I did everything in my powerto get me as far as I could in
943,01:07:17.71,01:07:17.71,this game.I don't know what the jury's
944,01:07:20.12,01:07:20.12,"gonna throw at me.But whatever they throw at me,"
945,01:07:22.29,01:07:22.29,I'm definitely going to have ananswer.
946,01:07:24.29,01:07:24.29,"I mean, I have good reason forevery move I made in this game."
947,01:07:29.04,01:07:29.04,"None of them are gonna scare me.Bottom line is I outwitted,"
948,01:07:32.21,01:07:32.21,outplayed and outlasted everysingle one of them.
949,01:07:34.46,01:07:34.46,And that's why I'm in the finaltwo and they're not.
950,01:08:17.21,01:08:17.21,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe jury.
951,01:08:21.42,01:08:21.42,Bobby Jon.Jamie.
952,01:08:24.33,01:08:24.33,Gary.Judd.

954,01:08:29.08,01:08:29.08,And Rafe.Voted out at the last Tribal
955,01:08:31.71,01:08:31.71,"Council.Danni, first things first."
956,01:08:36.17,01:08:36.17,You can take off your immunitynecklace.
957,01:08:38.50,01:08:38.50,"You don't need it anymore.Well, congratulations on doing"
958,01:08:43.58,01:08:43.58,"what 16 other people could notdo in this game, and that is"
959,01:08:47.08,01:08:47.08,make it to the final two.The jury composed of seven
960,01:08:50.29,01:08:50.29,people that you had a handeither directly or indirectly in
961,01:08:54.00,01:08:54.00,"voting out, now holds your fatein their hands."
962,01:08:56.79,01:08:56.79,And based on the answers thatyou give them to their questions
963,01:09:00.71,01:09:00.71,"tonight, they will decide whichone of the two of you they think"
964,01:09:04.17,01:09:04.17,is most deserving of the titleof Sole Survivor and the check
965,01:09:07.33,01:09:07.33,for a million dollars that goeswith it.
966,01:09:09.50,01:09:09.50,Here is how it'll work.You two will have a chance to
967,01:09:12.12,01:09:12.12,"make opening statements, achance to try to convince them"
968,01:09:15.21,01:09:15.21,why you are the most deserving.Then they will get their first
969,01:09:18.54,01:09:18.54,chance to address you with aquestion and a statement.
970,01:09:21.25,01:09:21.25,Then you will get a chance tomake a closing comment.
971,01:09:24.42,01:09:24.42,And then we vote.Make sense?
972,01:09:26.67,01:09:26.67,>> Uh-huh.>> PROBST: Let's get started.
973,01:09:28.58,01:09:28.58,"Danni, opening statement.>> Okay, um..."
974,01:09:32.17,01:09:32.17,"Gosh, I don't know where tobegin."
975,01:09:34.33,01:09:34.33,I just feel honored to be inthis position.
976,01:09:37.21,01:09:37.21,Because making that merge fromYaxha over to Nakum and being in
977,01:09:41.38,01:09:41.38,"that numbers game, I thoughtthere was no chance in heck that"
978,01:09:45.29,01:09:45.29,I would ever be sitting in thisposition.
979,01:09:47.88,01:09:47.88,And I was surprised that nobodyreally thought that I was a
980,01:09:51.67,01:09:51.67,threat.Because I do have a little bit
981,01:09:54.29,01:09:54.29,"of an athletic background, and Iknew I couldn't be stopped when"
982,01:09:58.17,01:09:58.17,it came to endurance becauseI've overcome a couple of
983,01:10:01.04,01:10:01.04,hardships in my life thatmade me strong mentally.
984,01:10:04.17,01:10:04.17,"And I tried to play the game thebest that I could, as honest"
985,01:10:07.58,01:10:07.58,that I could.And I just hope at the end of
986,01:10:10.12,01:10:10.12,"all this, after everything isdone, that we'll be able to have"
987,01:10:13.67,01:10:13.67,you guys come to Kansas City andeat some good barbecue and go to
988,01:10:17.00,01:10:17.00,"a ball game.>> PROBST: Steph, opening"
989,01:10:21.12,01:10:21.12,"statement.>> Um, I just, I first want to"
990,01:10:26.54,01:10:26.54,start off by basically thankingall of you for making this an
991,01:10:30.21,01:10:30.21,"amazing, amazing experience forme."
992,01:10:32.38,01:10:32.38,I never thought coming intothis Survivor that I would even
993,01:10:36.08,01:10:36.08,have a shot at making it pasteven the first Tribal Council.
994,01:10:39.62,01:10:39.62,"So, to be sitting in the finaltwo next to Danni, I am"
995,01:10:43.04,01:10:43.04,completely honored.And I know that there are a few
996,01:10:46.46,01:10:46.46,people that are a little upsetwith me so I can't wait to talk
997,01:10:49.21,01:10:49.21,"to you, and I hope can I easeyour mind a little bit."
998,01:10:51.71,01:10:51.71,I will be as honest as I haveever been.
999,01:10:54.21,01:10:54.21,"You know, this has been a greatride, and I am glad I could have"
1000,01:10:57.42,01:10:57.42,experienced it with all of you.>> PROBST: All right.
1001,01:11:03.50,01:11:03.50,"Jury, in a moment you get yourfirst chance to address Danni"
1002,01:11:06.17,01:11:06.17,and Steph.I'll give you a moment to think
1003,01:11:08.29,01:11:08.29,"about what you want to say.>> PROBST: Okay, jury."
1004,01:11:31.88,01:11:31.88,You've heard their openingstatements.
1005,01:11:33.75,01:11:33.75,It's your turn now to addressthem with a question and/or
1006,01:11:36.38,01:11:36.38,"comment.Bobby Jon, you're up."
1007,01:11:40.17,01:11:40.17,>> How is it going?>> Good.
1008,01:11:42.04,01:11:42.04,">> Thanks.>> First of all, I want to say"
1009,01:11:44.42,01:11:44.42,"after a long 39 days orwhatever, nobody can ever take"
1010,01:11:47.12,01:11:47.12,away from you for making it tothe final two.
1011,01:11:49.50,01:11:49.50,>> Thank you.>> That's for certain.
1012,01:11:51.46,01:11:51.46,"Steph, I will start with you.I know the only reason I am"
1013,01:11:54.62,01:11:54.62,standing right here is becauseof you.
1014,01:11:56.67,01:11:56.67,So I do appreciate that.I really do.
1015,01:11:58.75,01:11:58.75,But my first question for you ishow proud are you of yourself of
1016,01:12:02.83,01:12:02.83,"playing this game up until now?>> Actually, I am proud of the"
1017,01:12:06.79,01:12:06.79,way I played this game.I know there are two people in
1018,01:12:10.96,01:12:10.96,particular that I have sort ofbackstabbed.
1019,01:12:14.21,01:12:14.21,"And other than that, I haveplayed the best game I know how"
1020,01:12:16.33,01:12:16.33,to play.I came into this game with a
1021,01:12:18.33,01:12:18.33,huge target on my back just likeyou did.
1022,01:12:20.58,01:12:20.58,>> Right.>> And there's nothing I regret.
1023,01:12:22.83,01:12:22.83,And there's nothing I'd takeback that I did.
1024,01:12:25.04,01:12:25.04,">> Good answer.Danni, I guess the same thing."
1025,01:12:27.62,01:12:27.62,"I wanna ask you is up until now,are you proud of how you played"
1026,01:12:30.79,01:12:30.79,the game?>> I am.
1027,01:12:32.96,01:12:32.96,I'm happy with the way I playedthe game.
1028,01:12:36.12,01:12:36.12,And I was surprised at how longI stuck around and feel just
1029,01:12:40.25,01:12:40.25,grateful to be here.And the only thing I wish that
1030,01:12:43.00,01:12:43.00,could happen differently is thatwe would have won a few more of
1031,01:12:46.04,01:12:46.04,"those immunity challenges sowhen we merged over,"
1032,01:12:48.12,01:12:48.12,we would've...>> Right.
1033,01:12:49.96,01:12:49.96,>> Had our group together 'causewe had so much fun.
1034,01:12:53.38,01:12:53.38,">> That's all I got.>> PROBST: Thanks, Bobby Jon."
1035,01:12:56.17,01:12:56.17,>> Thanks.>> PROBST: Gary.
1036,01:13:00.21,01:13:00.21,>> I think this game is stillgoing to be played until the
1037,01:13:03.96,01:13:03.96,last answer that you givetonight.
1038,01:13:06.08,01:13:06.08,So I'm gonna judge my votetonight on who I think gives me
1039,01:13:10.75,01:13:10.75,"the most honest answers.Straight out, no garbage."
1040,01:13:14.17,01:13:14.17,I want to start with Stephfirst.
1041,01:13:16.92,01:13:16.92,I want to know why I should notvote for you tonight.
1042,01:13:19.79,01:13:19.79,>> Why you shouldn't?>> I guess the first thing was
1043,01:13:22.08,01:13:22.08,we made an alliance the firstday.
1044,01:13:24.12,01:13:24.12,"And I said, you know, no matterwhat, we'll try to stick"
1045,01:13:27.17,01:13:27.17,together.And then we got separated and I
1046,01:13:29.42,01:13:29.42,"formed another alliance.And when you came over, you"
1047,01:13:32.79,01:13:32.79,"know, I didn't.I voted you out."
1048,01:13:34.58,01:13:34.58,"So, yeah, maybe there is areason why maybe you shouldn't"
1049,01:13:37.12,01:13:37.12,vote for me.>> Okay.
1050,01:13:38.79,01:13:38.79,"Thank you.Danni, same question."
1051,01:13:42.04,01:13:42.04,">> First of all, I definitelyhad an alliance with you."
1052,01:13:46.62,01:13:46.62,"But also, I was aligning myselfwith Rafe."
1053,01:13:50.21,01:13:50.21,That was maybe the wrong thingto do.
1054,01:13:54.17,01:13:54.17,So I made a selfish move at thatpoint.
1055,01:13:56.92,01:13:56.92,And that's one thing I'm nevernormally is selfish.
1056,01:13:59.71,01:13:59.71,But in this game you have to beat times.
1057,01:14:02.96,01:14:02.96,And that is the main reason.I'm sorry for that.
1058,01:14:06.25,01:14:06.25,>> Okay.Thank you very much.
1059,01:14:08.58,01:14:08.58,">> PROBST: Thank you, Gary.>> Thank you."
1060,01:14:11.04,01:14:11.04,>> PROBST: Jamie.>> What an adventure.
1061,01:14:18.79,01:14:18.79,( laughing )I will say that.
1062,01:14:20.25,01:14:20.25,I will go to Danni first.I've always believed it is not
1063,01:14:23.21,01:14:23.21,where you go; it's who you gowith.
1064,01:14:25.50,01:14:25.50,"My question to you is if youwould have had numbers, who"
1065,01:14:29.71,01:14:29.71,would your top five been andwhy?
1066,01:14:32.00,01:14:32.00,">> Well, definitely, Bobby Jonand Gary."
1067,01:14:36.29,01:14:36.29,"Those two, and then Brandon.Definitely."
1068,01:14:38.33,01:14:38.33,Brandon and I had a good bond.If we would've had four of us
1069,01:14:41.12,01:14:41.12,"there together, something wouldhave happened."
1070,01:14:43.29,01:14:43.29,But I would have liked for it toend up that way for sure.
1071,01:14:49.00,01:14:49.00,">> Okay.Stephenie, you get a little bit"
1072,01:14:52.33,01:14:52.33,of a tougher one.>> Thanks.
1073,01:14:54.21,01:14:54.21,>> My question to you is: Iwouldn't talk to people if I was
1074,01:14:59.08,01:14:59.08,going to vote them out.I am not good with getting close
1075,01:15:01.62,01:15:01.62,"to people and letting them go.And with you, you'd be the best"
1076,01:15:04.17,01:15:04.17,friend till we were in TribalCouncil.
1077,01:15:06.29,01:15:06.29,And then you'd vote them out.And my question is how do you
1078,01:15:09.71,01:15:09.71,"think the jury who has todecide, how do you think they"
1079,01:15:12.96,01:15:12.96,feel about that when they sawthat?
1080,01:15:15.21,01:15:15.21,>> That's a good question.I'll start with you.
1081,01:15:18.17,01:15:18.17,"The day your name came up to getvoted out, it was not my full"
1082,01:15:23.08,01:15:23.08,"decision.I mean, there was a group of us."
1083,01:15:25.46,01:15:25.46,"And I have a hard time saying tosomebody, ""I'm voting you out."""
1084,01:15:29.12,01:15:29.12,"Because like you said,blind-sided is the best way to"
1085,01:15:32.38,01:15:32.38,go.So I would only hope those
1086,01:15:35.04,01:15:35.04,people will see I had reallygood reasons in doing so and
1087,01:15:38.50,01:15:38.50,they would respect my game andaward me their vote because they
1088,01:15:42.12,01:15:42.12,think I am deserving of it.>> That's good to know.
1089,01:15:45.50,01:15:45.50,"Thank you.>> PROBST: Thanks, Jamie."
1090,01:15:49.25,01:15:49.25,"Lydia.>> Stephenie, I have been loyal"
1091,01:15:56.12,01:15:56.12,to you since day six of thisgame.
1092,01:15:58.79,01:15:58.79,>> I know.>> But you voted me out.
1093,01:16:00.79,01:16:00.79,"So, why should I vote for youtonight?"
1094,01:16:02.96,01:16:02.96,">> Actually, I want to thank youfor being so loyal to me the"
1095,01:16:06.17,01:16:06.17,"entire game, Lydia, and youabsolutely were."
1096,01:16:08.71,01:16:08.71,"Even though you and I had beentogether since day one, if I"
1097,01:16:11.75,01:16:11.75,"took you to the final, I wouldprobably have a better shot of"
1098,01:16:14.67,01:16:14.67,"beating you than Danni.But then, what does that say for"
1099,01:16:17.17,01:16:17.17,me?Who is super-competitive and
1100,01:16:19.17,01:16:19.17,super-athletic.And I'm gonna take Lydia because
1101,01:16:21.17,01:16:21.17,"I think I can beat her?I mean, that's not what really"
1102,01:16:24.33,01:16:24.33,"competitive people do.So, I went up against the best"
1103,01:16:27.67,01:16:27.67,and I'd like to beat the best.And that's why I'm sitting next
1104,01:16:31.17,01:16:31.17,to her right now.>> Okay.
1105,01:16:33.88,01:16:33.88,"And question for Danni.Danni, you told me that ""I am"
1106,01:16:37.75,01:16:37.75,"going to take care of you.Trust me."""
1107,01:16:41.17,01:16:41.17,And I did.What happened?
1108,01:16:43.50,01:16:43.50,Why should I give you my vote?>> You totally could trust me.
1109,01:16:46.25,01:16:46.25,And remember I talked to you andlet you know what I heard and
1110,01:16:49.12,01:16:49.12,you had let me know what youheard.
1111,01:16:51.33,01:16:51.33,And we kept those lines ofcommunication completely open
1112,01:16:53.62,01:16:53.62,and honest.We are all here to win a
1113,01:16:56.25,01:16:56.25,million.But everybody's trying to come
1114,01:16:58.33,01:16:58.33,out the winner.And sometimes you're gonna have
1115,01:17:01.12,01:17:01.12,to do some lying or manipulatingor something in part of the game
1116,01:17:04.88,01:17:04.88,to try to outwit.And sometimes you have to do
1117,01:17:07.33,01:17:07.33,that-- it is a game.>> Okay.
1118,01:17:09.58,01:17:09.58,">> PROBST: Thanks, Lydia.Cindy."
1119,01:17:18.29,01:17:18.29,>> I will do Danni first.If you could remove one of the
1120,01:17:22.54,01:17:22.54,"jury members, who would it be,and why would you want that"
1121,01:17:26.42,01:17:26.42,person eliminated from the jury?>> Definitely it would be Rafe
1122,01:17:30.96,01:17:30.96,because I know for sure he isvoting for Stephenie because
1123,01:17:34.29,01:17:34.29,"they've had that bond since thevery, very beginning."
1124,01:17:36.83,01:17:36.83,And of course you want to win.So that's who I would remove.
1125,01:17:40.21,01:17:40.21,">> That's pretty honest.Um, same thing for Stephenie."
1126,01:17:44.54,01:17:44.54,">> Oh, my God.I don't know."
1127,01:17:48.08,01:17:48.08,"If I had to take somebody offthe jury, I guess it would be"
1128,01:17:51.00,01:17:51.00,Bobby Jon because he was thefirst one that made the jury.
1129,01:17:54.71,01:17:54.71,That's my answer.I don't know.
1130,01:17:56.25,01:17:56.25,I wouldn't want to take anybodyout of the game.
1131,01:17:59.04,01:17:59.04,>> Okay.That sounds okay for me.
1132,01:18:01.71,01:18:01.71,">> PROBST: Thanks, Cindy.Rafe."
1133,01:18:09.79,01:18:09.79,">> Um, first off,congratulations on being the"
1134,01:18:12.08,01:18:12.08,final two.You two were really like sisters
1135,01:18:15.08,01:18:15.08,to me out here.And like I am proud that one of
1136,01:18:17.08,01:18:17.08,you is gonna win a milliondollars tonight.
1137,01:18:19.12,01:18:19.12,"I'm gonna go with Danni first.You said, ""Rafe, if I ever get"
1138,01:18:22.33,01:18:22.33,in a situation where I am in thefinal three and I can take the
1139,01:18:25.96,01:18:25.96,person I think I'll beat overthe person I think deserves to
1140,01:18:29.12,01:18:29.12,"win, I'll take the person Ithink deserves to win."""
1141,01:18:32.17,01:18:32.17,"So, I'm wondering what happenedwhen you had that decision right"
1142,01:18:35.75,01:18:35.75,in front of you and made theopposite of what you said you
1143,01:18:39.12,01:18:39.12,"would make?>> Well, first of all, one thing"
1144,01:18:43.21,01:18:43.21,that changed my mind was duringthat immunity challenge
1145,01:18:46.17,01:18:46.17,"yesterday, I saw Stephenie overthere crying, her legs shaking,"
1146,01:18:49.00,01:18:49.00,"giving everything she could.She said, ""I'm not stopping"
1147,01:18:51.46,01:18:51.46,"until I pass out.""And I felt like somebody who"
1148,01:18:54.04,01:18:54.04,came into the game who had atarget on their back from the
1149,01:18:57.21,01:18:57.21,very beginning who foughtthrough all the odds shows
1150,01:19:00.29,01:19:00.29,that she really is the bestplayer.
1151,01:19:02.29,01:19:02.29,"I mean, she knows how to playthe game."
1152,01:19:04.83,01:19:04.83,"So, I mean, it's a toss-upbetween who was the strongest"
1153,01:19:07.17,01:19:07.17,between the two.Or even who's the most
1154,01:19:09.33,01:19:09.33,deserving.Because I think either one of
1155,01:19:11.58,01:19:11.58,you would be just as deserving.>> Okay.
1156,01:19:13.75,01:19:13.75,That's good.I wanted to understand why that
1157,01:19:16.04,01:19:16.04,decision changed.And I think you answered that.
1158,01:19:18.42,01:19:18.42,"Steph, I think that you havekind of given a clear reason why"
1159,01:19:23.29,01:19:23.29,you should win this game is thatyou dominated it in terms of
1160,01:19:26.62,01:19:26.62,strategy.You were the reason that a lot
1161,01:19:29.17,01:19:29.17,"of people were voted out.And I, as a competitor really"
1162,01:19:31.67,01:19:31.67,respect that.And I was the one who knew it
1163,01:19:34.04,01:19:34.04,most because we talked strategyall the time with each other.
1164,01:19:36.50,01:19:36.50,What I am interested to hearfrom you is what you think the
1165,01:19:39.54,01:19:39.54,best strategic decision or moveyou made in the game was that
1166,01:19:42.75,01:19:42.75,you didn't tell me about.>> Hmm.
1167,01:19:47.79,01:19:47.79,I honestly do not think therewas one.
1168,01:19:50.38,01:19:50.38,You are the only person I wascompletely honest with in this
1169,01:19:53.04,01:19:53.04,entire game.>> Okay.
1170,01:19:54.75,01:19:54.75,"Steph, I really would like toknow why you think you should"
1171,01:19:57.21,01:19:57.21,beat the other person in yourclosing comments.
1172,01:19:59.29,01:19:59.29,Like why you think you shouldwin.
1173,01:20:01.62,01:20:01.62,">> Okay.Thanks, Rafe."
1174,01:20:03.71,01:20:03.71,">> Thanks.>> PROBST: Thanks, Rafe."
1175,01:20:06.21,01:20:06.21,"Judd.>> First of all, I want to"
1176,01:20:12.50,01:20:12.50,congratulate you.Good job well done.
1177,01:20:14.71,01:20:14.71,"First, Danni.I want to know if you've ever"
1178,01:20:18.17,01:20:18.17,went roller-blading or iceskating before?
1179,01:20:21.33,01:20:21.33,>> Roller-blading or iceskating?
1180,01:20:23.25,01:20:23.25,>> Have you ever ice skated orroller-bladed before?
1181,01:20:25.58,01:20:25.58,">> I've done both, yes.Not very well."
1182,01:20:28.25,01:20:28.25,>> I think you're one of thebest ice skaters I've ever seen.
1183,01:20:30.83,01:20:30.83,'Cause I believe your strategywas to just skate right through
1184,01:20:34.08,01:20:34.08,this damn game like you did.The second question is were you
1185,01:20:38.08,01:20:38.08,deceitful?Were you a backstabber?
1186,01:20:40.71,01:20:40.71,"Were you a liar?>> The one time that I did lie,"
1187,01:20:45.42,01:20:45.42,Jamie came up and asked me who Iwas going to be voting for that
1188,01:20:51.29,01:20:51.29,night.And I told him I would put
1189,01:20:53.29,01:20:53.29,"Gary's name down.So, I lied in that situation."
1190,01:20:56.21,01:20:56.21,"And another time Brian asked me,""Who are you gonna vote for?"
1191,01:20:58.50,01:20:58.50,"Who are you gonna vote for?""And I just plain flat told him I"
1192,01:21:01.17,01:21:01.17,didn't know just because Ididn't want to be there to be
1193,01:21:03.29,01:21:03.29,much confrontation.>> To me it sounds like you just
1194,01:21:05.96,01:21:05.96,lied a lot.So I would suggest when you get
1195,01:21:08.38,01:21:08.38,"back home, first thing you do isgo to confession."
1196,01:21:10.96,01:21:10.96,">> You know, it's funny, Judd.Because I do ask forgiveness"
1197,01:21:14.54,01:21:14.54,every day because it's not justlying everyday that we do.
1198,01:21:18.08,01:21:18.08,"Believe me, I do askforgiveness."
1199,01:21:20.12,01:21:20.12,I ask forgiveness everyday abouteverything.
1200,01:21:23.04,01:21:23.04,">> Good answer.Steph, I want to know if you are"
1201,01:21:27.29,01:21:27.29,still starving?>> I'm starving.
1202,01:21:29.67,01:21:29.67,">> I mean, you have eaten morethan I have eaten when I'm home."
1203,01:21:33.12,01:21:33.12,I have been to three immunitiesand all you sit there and say is
1204,01:21:35.62,01:21:35.62,"you're starving.I'm like, starving?"
1205,01:21:37.21,01:21:37.21,This girl won four challenges.>> I love to eat and you know
1206,01:21:39.71,01:21:39.71,"that.>> Well, the only thing you"
1207,01:21:41.88,01:21:41.88,"should be starving for right nowis my damn vote, man."
1208,01:21:44.12,01:21:44.12,">> And I am, Judd.>> Basically, your strategy in"
1209,01:21:47.17,01:21:47.17,"this game was just to backstab,man, and lie and be deceitful."
1210,01:21:49.75,01:21:49.75,">> That's not true.>> Everybody that walked by you,"
1211,01:21:51.75,01:21:51.75,"man.You backstabbed this one,"
1212,01:21:54.12,01:21:54.12,"that one, that one, that one.I think you backstabbed"
1213,01:21:56.33,01:21:56.33,"everybody in this game.>> No, I didn't."
1214,01:21:58.12,01:21:58.12,">> But you crossed the line,man, when you lied to my wife,"
1215,01:22:00.67,01:22:00.67,"man, and you said that we havethe strongest alliance here, and"
1216,01:22:03.12,01:22:03.12,"that was crossing the damn line,man, and you should've just"
1217,01:22:05.46,01:22:05.46,"never opened your damn mouth,man, when my wife got there, so"
1218,01:22:08.25,01:22:08.25,"not only did you lie to me, man,you lied to my wife, and that's"
1219,01:22:11.08,01:22:11.08,pretty brutal.And I'm gonna promise you
1220,01:22:13.17,01:22:13.17,something tonight and I'm gonnastick to my promise.
1221,01:22:16.04,01:22:16.04,">> Judd, can I respond to thator do you not want a response?"
1222,01:22:19.00,01:22:19.00,>> Of course.Absolutely.
1223,01:22:20.75,01:22:20.75,">> Um, I actually didn't lie toKristin."
1224,01:22:23.04,01:22:23.04,We had a strong alliance.I planned on going to the end
1225,01:22:25.29,01:22:25.29,"with you.>> Yeah, but you lied to her."
1226,01:22:27.50,01:22:27.50,>> I wasn't lying at thatpoint.
1227,01:22:29.50,01:22:29.50,">> How's that not a lie?Evidentially, you're there and"
1228,01:22:31.79,01:22:31.79,I'm here.So you lied.
1229,01:22:33.75,01:22:33.75,>> I had no idea I was going tovote you out.
1230,01:22:36.17,01:22:36.17,"It wasn't my idea.Listen, first of all, Danni came"
1231,01:22:39.21,01:22:39.21,"to Rafe and I said, ""I just wantyou guys to know that Judd was"
1232,01:22:43.88,01:22:43.88,"trying to get Rafe and then me."">> Yeah, but I never told"
1233,01:22:48.21,01:22:48.21,anybody about I was targetingyou or Rafe.
1234,01:22:51.25,01:22:51.25,They came up to me and asked whowas the biggest threat and all's
1235,01:22:54.08,01:22:54.08,"I said to them was, ""Wow, man,you shouldn't be in this damn"
1236,01:22:56.67,01:22:56.67,"game if you know who the biggestthreat is."""
1237,01:22:58.96,01:22:58.96,But I like your answers.Thank you.
1238,01:23:01.00,01:23:01.00,>> All right.I'm sorry.
1239,01:23:06.29,01:23:06.29,>> PROBST: I've got to say after39 days out here with the level

1241,01:23:13.25,01:23:13.25,"guys tonight, I don't think youcan ask more from a jury."
1242,01:23:16.54,01:23:16.54,So you do have one last chanceto convince these guys of why
1243,01:23:20.12,01:23:20.12,you deserve the million dollars.I'm gonna give you a minute to
1244,01:23:23.08,01:23:23.08,think about it.>> PROBST: Okay.
1245,01:23:44.21,01:23:44.21,"You heard from the jury, verycandid jury."
1246,01:23:46.38,01:23:46.38,Good questions.Asked you to be honest.
1247,01:23:49.58,01:23:49.58,You know what they want to hear.They want to hear why you
1248,01:23:52.33,01:23:52.33,deserve it.Closing statements.
1249,01:23:55.00,01:23:55.00,"Steph, you're first.>> Okay."
1250,01:23:57.50,01:23:57.50,I just want to thank all youguys for your questions and
1251,01:24:00.21,01:24:00.21,"comments and now I'd like toprove to you why I think, um, I"
1252,01:24:03.21,01:24:03.21,"deserve your vote.First of all, I think the game"
1253,01:24:06.17,01:24:06.17,"Survivor is, um, it's thehardest game anyone will ever"
1254,01:24:10.08,01:24:10.08,"play, and, you know, it's gonnabring out some of the worst"
1255,01:24:13.79,01:24:13.79,qualities in people.But it doesn't mean that we're
1256,01:24:16.33,01:24:16.33,bad people.And I know that I hurt a few
1257,01:24:19.12,01:24:19.12,people along the way and Isincerely do apologize.
1258,01:24:21.75,01:24:21.75,But the fact is I came to thisgame with a plan and it was to
1259,01:24:25.17,01:24:25.17,ally myself with great peopleand to try to always have the
1260,01:24:28.21,01:24:28.21,numbers on my side and to staycompletely calm at all times.
1261,01:24:31.58,01:24:31.58,I never let anybody makedecisions for me.
1262,01:24:36.25,01:24:36.25,"You know, fortunately, orunfortunately, I had to take a"
1263,01:24:38.96,01:24:38.96,"leadership role in this game,and I think that I outwitted and"
1264,01:24:44.58,01:24:44.58,"outplayed and outlasted the bestthat I knew how to, and that's"
1265,01:24:48.00,01:24:48.00,why I am sitting here in thefinal two and that's why I would
1266,01:24:50.67,01:24:50.67,be honored to have your votes asthe Sole Survivor.

1270,01:25:06.96,01:25:06.96,want to scramble too soon.I wanted to... to sit back and
1271,01:25:09.25,01:25:09.25,"see who was in control of thegame, and it was clear Stephanie"
1272,01:25:12.12,01:25:12.12,and Rafe were completely incontrol of the game and they're
1273,01:25:14.62,01:25:14.62,the reason why each one of youguys are sitting up there right
1274,01:25:17.33,01:25:17.33,"now.And I thought, ""You know what?"
1275,01:25:19.92,01:25:19.92,"I'm gonna try to align with thestrongest,"" and we ended up"

1277,01:25:25.38,01:25:25.38,"them great, and ended up gettingthat bond, because otherwise, I"
1278,01:25:28.71,01:25:28.71,would have been gone.So I feel I really did outwit
1279,01:25:31.92,01:25:31.92,"and I definitely outlasted.And, um, I would appreciate"
1280,01:25:35.75,01:25:35.75,"your, uh, your vote tonight,absolutely."
1281,01:25:39.04,01:25:39.04,"And, like I said, there's noreason why I should say I"
