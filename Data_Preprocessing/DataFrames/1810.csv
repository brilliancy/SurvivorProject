2,00:00:02.21,00:00:02.21,Survivor: at the newly merged Forza tribe...
3,00:00:08.75,00:00:08.75,...former Timbira members Coach and Tyson put together
4,00:00:12.17,00:00:12.17,an alliance. >> That's what I'm talking
5,00:00:16.17,00:00:16.17,"about, man. >> All right."
6,00:00:17.21,00:00:17.21,>> PROBST: And they targeted one of their own.
7,00:00:21.54,00:00:21.54,While Sierra and Brendan also tried to pull in the Jalapao
8,00:00:24.67,00:00:24.67,Three. >> I think we go after Coach.
9,00:00:28.71,00:00:28.71,>> Okay. >> PROBST: Setting the stage for
10,00:00:30.71,00:00:30.71,a showdown between Brendan and Coach.
11,00:00:33.12,00:00:33.12,>> We're cutting the head off the dragon and sending Brendan
12,00:00:35.50,00:00:35.50,"home. When it comes head-to-head,"
13,00:00:37.50,00:00:37.50,we'll see who really was the Chosen One.
14,00:00:40.00,00:00:40.00,>> PROBST: And the old Jalapao tribe found themselves in an
15,00:00:42.71,00:00:42.71,unlikely position. At the immunity challenge:
16,00:00:50.21,00:00:50.21,"Getting down to it, it is Brendan and Tyson."
17,00:00:52.79,00:00:52.79,Tyson won his second immunity in a row.
18,00:00:57.12,00:00:57.12,"And at Tribal Council, Brendan thought his plan was in the bag."
19,00:01:01.71,00:01:01.71,"If anybody has the hidden immunity idol, and you want to"
20,00:01:04.04,00:01:04.04,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
21,00:01:07.29,00:01:07.29,And didn't play his idol. Brendan.
22,00:01:12.25,00:01:12.25,The old Jalapao tribe sided with Coach's alliance.
23,00:01:15.67,00:01:15.67,Eighth person voted out and the first member of our jury:
24,00:01:18.71,00:01:18.71,"Brendan. Blindsiding Brendan, and leaving"
25,00:01:22.62,00:01:22.62,"Sierra in an alliance of one. Brendan, the tribe has spoken."
26,00:01:29.04,00:01:29.04,Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
27,00:01:38.50,00:01:38.50,>> So how awesome was that? >> Awesome!
28,00:01:41.88,00:01:41.88,">> Sierra, you got to admit. >> Yeah, you guys are..."
29,00:01:45.25,00:01:45.25,">> Pretty badass. >> I mean, obviously, I know"
30,00:01:47.50,00:01:47.50,"I'm the next one to go, so let's just try to make these next"
31,00:01:52.25,00:01:52.25,"couple days congenial, I guess. I mean..."
32,00:01:57.25,00:01:57.25,Whatever. That sucked.
33,00:01:59.12,00:01:59.12,It was probably the worst night I've ever had out here.
34,00:02:02.21,00:02:02.21,"And right now I'm just tired and kind of hurt, and I kind of just"
35,00:02:08.25,00:02:08.25,want to disappear. Can I please have a conversation
36,00:02:10.75,00:02:10.75,"with you, Coach? >> Yes."
37,00:02:12.79,00:02:12.79,>> Thank you. I don't think I'm a bad person
38,00:02:16.54,00:02:16.54,"for writing Coach's name down. Although, it was a very hard"
39,00:02:19.79,00:02:19.79,choice to make. I have never planned on ever
40,00:02:22.79,00:02:22.79,voting for you. And I'm being 100% honest with
41,00:02:26.88,00:02:26.88,you. >> Every decision you made was
42,00:02:28.67,00:02:28.67,bad. You could have written down
43,00:02:30.38,00:02:30.38,anybody else's in this game that doesn't have the character like
44,00:02:33.08,00:02:33.08,I have. >> You're right.
45,00:02:34.29,00:02:34.29,>> Everybody out here has lied except for me.
46,00:02:36.50,00:02:36.50,"Um, I knew that Sierra would want to assuage her guilt,"
47,00:02:39.08,00:02:39.08,massage it. Make herself feel rationalized
48,00:02:43.17,00:02:43.17,and justified inside. That's what we do when we make
49,00:02:45.29,00:02:45.29,poor decisions in life. But you have to realize
50,00:02:47.46,00:02:47.46,"something. In war, and love and war..."
51,00:02:51.71,00:02:51.71,>> Mm-hmm. >> ...it's kill or be killed.
52,00:02:54.62,00:02:54.62,So you pitted yourself against me.
53,00:02:57.21,00:02:57.21,Brendan pitted himself against me.
54,00:02:59.83,00:02:59.83,Who deserves to go next?  Captioning sponsored by

57,00:04:12.00,00:04:12.00,>> I came down to the water early this morning to celebrate
58,00:04:14.38,00:04:14.38,the victory over Brendan. Throughout the entire
59,00:04:19.79,00:04:19.79,"meditation, there was this feeling of peace that just kind"
60,00:04:24.46,00:04:24.46,of settled over me and permeated my every fiber.
61,00:04:29.75,00:04:29.75,"For me to pit myself against somebody who is younger, that"
62,00:04:32.92,00:04:32.92,"is faster than me, and maybe stronger than me, although I"
63,00:04:37.29,00:04:37.29,bench-press 300 pounds. And we were talking two days ago
64,00:04:40.12,00:04:40.12,"and he was like, ""Really?"" 'Cause he doesn't do that."
65,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,"To defeat a worthy opponent like that, at this stage in the"
66,00:04:48.67,00:04:48.67,game-- the piece de r\xc3\xa9sistance. The dragonslayer has vanquished
67,00:04:56.58,00:04:56.58,the dragon once and for all. (shouts)
68,00:05:03.38,00:05:03.38,Over! The battle has already been won.
69,00:05:06.08,00:05:06.08,"Victory is mine. >> Well, it just all started"
70,00:05:17.79,00:05:17.79,with the way that I started off as a rocky start and I latched
71,00:05:20.67,00:05:20.67,"on to someone else. I guess I was blinded, so I'm"
72,00:05:22.96,00:05:22.96,not even going to say that I wasn't.
73,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,>> Tribal Council went as planned.
74,00:05:26.67,00:05:26.67,Brendan didn't have a clue it was coming.
75,00:05:28.62,00:05:28.62,"And, uh, Sierra was really shocked."
76,00:05:30.67,00:05:30.67,Stephen and I-- we've actually put ourselves in a really
77,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,"good position. And actually, Stephen and I"
78,00:05:34.54,00:05:34.54,"could've decided who went home last night, and we decided to"
79,00:05:37.42,00:05:37.42,stick through with the warrior alliance.
80,00:05:39.92,00:05:39.92,"And Stephen and I, we're happy with the way things are going."
81,00:05:42.54,00:05:42.54,We're happy to see Sierra go next.
82,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,>> I guess the unfortunate part is I didn't make any choices
83,00:05:47.54,00:05:47.54,"in it, and I followed along. >> But that's out of your"
84,00:05:50.12,00:05:50.12,character. >> Right.
85,00:05:51.17,00:05:51.17,">> You say stuff, you know what I mean?"
86,00:05:53.12,00:05:53.12,You jump into any conversation about anything.
87,00:05:57.29,00:05:57.29,">> He was holding the idol, so, therefore, I was playing..."
88,00:06:00.75,00:06:00.75,>> The most powerful thing is friends.
89,00:06:04.46,00:06:04.46,">> After last night at Tribal Council, I guess I'm kind of"
90,00:06:07.17,00:06:07.17,pleading for my life. What sucks the most is that I
91,00:06:10.83,00:06:10.83,was on top of the game yesterday.
92,00:06:14.17,00:06:14.17,"And then today, I'm, like, at the bottom of the food chain."
93,00:06:16.88,00:06:16.88,But I'm not going to just roll over and die.
94,00:06:19.25,00:06:19.25,I'm sorry that I made bad choices.
95,00:06:21.25,00:06:21.25,>> Okay. >> Everyone's had moments of
96,00:06:22.88,00:06:22.88,"betrayal, but I wasn't about to go on some massacre against"
97,00:06:26.08,00:06:26.08,you. And I wasn't about to go on some
98,00:06:28.25,00:06:28.25,"massacre against Coach, and... >> I like to see Sierra scramble"
99,00:06:32.46,00:06:32.46,"and mope. Uh, I think it's funny because"
100,00:06:35.12,00:06:35.12,"I've never liked Sierra. To me, she's of no worth."
101,00:06:39.33,00:06:39.33,"I mean, her parents probably love her."
102,00:06:41.67,00:06:41.67,I can't imagine her boyfriend's that cool.
103,00:06:44.79,00:06:44.79,"The thing is, the most important thing here is trust."
104,00:06:47.46,00:06:47.46,>> I agree with that. >> And you know what?
105,00:06:51.21,00:06:51.21,"It's... everybody here in camp right now, I get along with."
106,00:06:54.54,00:06:54.54,And I don't feel like anybody's a snake waiting to bite me.
107,00:06:58.21,00:06:58.21,"And you keep scrambling and you keep backpedaling, and you keep"
108,00:07:00.96,00:07:00.96,making excuses about how you didn't know.
109,00:07:03.83,00:07:03.83,So you can scramble all you want...
110,00:07:05.62,00:07:05.62,">> I'm not trying to scramble, Tyson."
111,00:07:07.67,00:07:07.67,I'm trying to explain my side so it doesn't look like I was
112,00:07:11.38,00:07:11.38,the mastermind behind it. >> I don't think you were the
113,00:07:13.67,00:07:13.67,mastermind. I don't think you're smart
114,00:07:15.12,00:07:15.12,"enough for it. Like, really."
115,00:07:17.92,00:07:17.92,>> That's fine. >> If I would have lost the
116,00:07:19.83,00:07:19.83,"challenge yesterday, who would you have voted for?"
117,00:07:22.50,00:07:22.50,>> That was undecided. I was... as far...
118,00:07:24.62,00:07:24.62,>> Who would you have voted for? >> J.T.
119,00:07:26.50,00:07:26.50,>> Wrong. >> That's where my head was at.
120,00:07:28.38,00:07:28.38,>> Brendan would have come to you and told you to vote for me.
121,00:07:31.04,00:07:31.04,>> And I probably would have done it.
122,00:07:32.38,00:07:32.38,">> Okay, you probably would have, and that's what I'm saying"
123,00:07:34.50,00:07:34.50,right now. >> Okay.
124,00:07:35.21,00:07:35.21,">> Okay? And I'm going to be straight up,"
125,00:07:37.17,00:07:37.17,100% honest with you right now. You're going to be the next
126,00:07:39.79,00:07:39.79,to go. You're not going to be able
127,00:07:41.12,00:07:41.12,"to change that. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
128,00:08:00.25,00:08:00.25,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
129,00:08:02.38,00:08:02.38,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
130,00:08:03.12,00:08:03.12,>> PROBST: For today's challenge you will be divided into two
131,00:08:05.58,00:08:05.58,"teams of four. On my go, two members of each"
132,00:08:08.62,00:08:08.62,"team will race out to collect a large puzzle board, then race"
133,00:08:11.96,00:08:11.96,"back, then the next two go. Once you have all four boards,"
134,00:08:15.12,00:08:15.12,you must arrange those boards in their own specific spots.
135,00:08:19.58,00:08:19.58,Then you will flip and rotate the boards until all the holes
136,00:08:24.00,00:08:24.00,"line up, revealing seven vowels. Once you have the seven vowels,"
137,00:08:29.25,00:08:29.25,"you will use the corresponding tiles on your answer board,"
138,00:08:32.17,00:08:32.17,along with the tiles of the seven consonants that are given
139,00:08:35.00,00:08:35.00,to you. You'll then combine them all to
140,00:08:37.17,00:08:37.17,form a four-word phrase. The winning team will be treated
141,00:08:41.21,00:08:41.21,to an afternoon of local entertainment and local food.
142,00:08:44.58,00:08:44.58,>> Oh... >> PROBST: You will be treated
143,00:08:46.71,00:08:46.71,to a performance of capoeira... >> Yes!
144,00:08:48.42,00:08:48.42,>> PROBST: ...a beautiful Brazilian martial art form that
145,00:08:51.21,00:08:51.21,combines dance and music. It's really pretty spectacular.
146,00:08:54.38,00:08:54.38,You will also enjoy a local feast.
147,00:08:56.71,00:08:56.71,"In addition, the winning team of four will send one person"
148,00:08:59.46,00:08:59.46,from the losing team to Exile Island.
149,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,Worth playing for? >> Yes!
150,00:09:03.46,00:09:03.46,>> PROBST: We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.
151,00:09:08.21,00:09:08.21,"All right, we have our two teams."
152,00:09:10.12,00:09:10.12,"Red team: J.T., Erinn, Debbie, and Tyson."
153,00:09:14.12,00:09:14.12,"The Black team: Coach, Stephen, Sierra, and Taj."
154,00:09:17.79,00:09:17.79,Nice reward on the line. Survivors ready?
155,00:09:21.92,00:09:21.92,Go! J.T. and Erinn heading out for
156,00:09:25.54,00:09:25.54,the Red. Coach and Stephen heading out
157,00:09:28.21,00:09:28.21,"for the Black team. >> Damn, J.T. is so fast."
158,00:09:36.04,00:09:36.04,">> All right, start working on the knots."
159,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,>> PROBST: Untie those boards and get them back.
160,00:09:45.21,00:09:45.21,>> Come on. >> PROBST: J.T. and Erinn

164,00:09:53.96,00:09:53.96,spot. Where does that first board go?
165,00:09:56.04,00:09:56.04,>> The last one. >> PROBST: Good!

171,00:10:22.96,00:10:22.96,with the Red team's second board.
172,00:10:25.79,00:10:25.79,Find the right slot. Get it in and the next pair goes
173,00:10:28.54,00:10:28.54,back out. >> Not that one.
174,00:10:30.46,00:10:30.46,">> Back up, back up. >> Go!"
175,00:10:33.25,00:10:33.25,>> PROBST: Coach and Stephen heading out now.
176,00:10:35.25,00:10:35.25,>> Whoo! >> Just put it in there!

180,00:10:47.08,00:10:47.08,>> I know. I couldn't get it any other way.
181,00:10:49.42,00:10:49.42,>> Got it? >> Yeah.
182,00:10:50.58,00:10:50.58,>> Yeah? >> PROBST: Red team's now in

195,00:11:35.79,00:11:35.79,struggling to get back. Those boards are heavy.

248,00:14:15.12,00:14:15.12,>> I was super-excited to win the challenge 'cause I've never
249,00:14:17.21,00:14:17.21,"been on a reward before. >> Oh, man, look at the food."
250,00:14:20.04,00:14:20.04,">> Just to the left of us was all this food, and I'm so hungry"
251,00:14:23.08,00:14:23.08,today. This is so perfect.
252,00:14:24.92,00:14:24.92,I really wanted this. >> Mmm!
253,00:14:28.04,00:14:28.04,">> Mmm! >> Oh, my gosh!"
254,00:14:30.54,00:14:30.54,"Did you get any of this? >> Mm-hmm. Yes, I did."
255,00:14:34.04,00:14:34.04,>> We look filthy. We haven't brushed our teeth in
256,00:14:37.21,00:14:37.21,"26 days, and then we pile on as much food as we can on our"
257,00:14:41.08,00:14:41.08,plates and we're eating like savages.
258,00:14:43.17,00:14:43.17,"And they're all looking at us like, ""What's wrong with these"
259,00:14:45.33,00:14:45.33,"people?"" >> We're very hungry."
260,00:14:48.12,00:14:48.12,">> Very hungry. >> Very, very hungry."

262,00:14:51.88,00:14:51.88,"And little children, I love little children."
263,00:14:54.00,00:14:54.00,I'm a school principal in the United States.
264,00:14:56.04,00:14:56.04,That's why I was asking about the children.
265,00:14:58.42,00:14:58.42,"As a mother, you know, I miss my children horribly at home."
266,00:15:02.83,00:15:02.83,"And as a principal, I miss all of you know, my 908 Drake"
267,00:15:08.62,00:15:08.62,"Middle School kids. So immediately, I just"
268,00:15:11.08,00:15:11.08,gravitated towards these little boys.
269,00:15:13.38,00:15:13.38,You're beautiful. You're a very handsome man.
270,00:15:17.79,00:15:17.79,(laughter) Yeah.
271,00:15:20.17,00:15:20.17,I don't think I'll ever take my job for granted anymore 'cause
272,00:15:23.12,00:15:23.12,"I've been without it, and I've always loved it, but I realize"
273,00:15:25.67,00:15:25.67,how much I love those kids that I work with.
274,00:15:37.54,00:15:37.54,">> Dueling banjos, okay. >> That's really cool."
275,00:15:42.25,00:15:42.25,(singing in Portuguese) >> Capoeira is a Brazilian
276,00:16:00.38,00:16:00.38,"form of martial arts, but they don't actually make any physical"
277,00:16:05.71,00:16:05.71,"contact. They look like they're fighting,"
278,00:16:08.75,00:16:08.75,but it's also a dance. and then they started pulling us
279,00:16:14.17,00:16:14.17,up and teaching us how to do the dance along with them.
280,00:16:19.00,00:16:19.00,(cheering) >> After we had eaten all that
281,00:16:34.00,00:16:34.00,"food, you're so stuffed you can't move, and then we've got"
282,00:16:36.71,00:16:36.71,"these people that are like, ""No, come, come, dance with us."""
283,00:16:39.25,00:16:39.25,"I'm like, ""Okay, do a little dance."
284,00:16:41.46,00:16:41.46,"Fine, no big deal."" But once I sat down again, oh,"
285,00:16:45.08,00:16:45.08,"man, it was terrible. I way overdid it."
286,00:16:51.08,00:16:51.08,"Gross, I just threw up on my feet."
287,00:16:54.25,00:16:54.25,"I was like the little kid that eats pizza and ice cream and,"
288,00:16:57.17,00:16:57.17,"like, gets in, like, the playland balls and jumps around"
289,00:17:00.21,00:17:00.21,"a bunch, and then can't understand why they threw up."
290,00:17:02.71,00:17:02.71,It was terrible. >> Brendan left with the idol
291,00:17:19.71,00:17:19.71,"in his pocket last night, and it could just be that there's a"
292,00:17:22.83,00:17:22.83,second idol out there and nobody knows where it is.
293,00:17:30.25,00:17:30.25,So I am hoping to find a clue to a new idol.
294,00:17:34.00,00:17:34.00,"And I would end up with two idols in my possession,"
295,00:17:36.92,00:17:36.92,This looks like a big piece of paper.
296,00:17:39.17,00:17:39.17,"Which could it might mean? Oh, no."
297,00:17:43.71,00:17:43.71,"It's clue #7, which means there's no new idol, which"
298,00:17:48.12,00:17:48.12,"means I'm here for nothing. Oh, well."
299,00:17:53.92,00:17:53.92,I'm lucky I'm not on that reward.
300,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,Who wants to be feasting when they could be... in sand?
301,00:18:01.04,00:18:01.04,Thank God I have no food and bleak surroundings for a couple
302,00:18:05.17,00:18:05.17,"of days, you know? (cawing)"
303,00:18:29.71,00:18:29.71,>> You and... and Coach and Tyson had an alliance?
304,00:18:33.50,00:18:33.50,"Does that make you bad people? >> No, but if we would have"
305,00:18:36.62,00:18:36.62,"messed up and, and gotten the wrong thing in the game, then I"
306,00:18:40.50,00:18:40.50,"expect to just... ""Yeah, I did wrong. I'm sorry."""
307,00:18:42.38,00:18:42.38,>> I didn't know. >> Who do you think needs to go
308,00:18:44.83,00:18:44.83,then? Everybody else has been loyal.
309,00:18:47.08,00:18:47.08,"Who goes, if not you? There's reactions to actions."
310,00:18:49.92,00:18:49.92,"You chose the wrong action, and, I mean, I love you to death."
311,00:18:52.46,00:18:52.46,I care about you. I don't like to have to vote
312,00:18:54.83,00:18:54.83,you off. >> You think what just happened
313,00:18:56.92,00:18:56.92,to you guys was a huge deal? You have no flippin' clue how
314,00:19:00.92,00:19:00.92,many people are going to do that to you guys.
315,00:19:03.04,00:19:03.04,"Later down the road, there will be a moment where you will"
316,00:19:05.38,00:19:05.38,"regret this. >> Prob... okay, maybe."
317,00:19:08.29,00:19:08.29,"But I have got an alliance now, and you've got to understand,"
318,00:19:10.83,00:19:10.83,"I've got to play the game, too, Sierra."
319,00:19:12.79,00:19:12.79,>> Now I'm in limbo. That puts me even more in an
320,00:19:15.33,00:19:15.33,insecure position. >> Okay.
321,00:19:17.25,00:19:17.25,">> That's the choice you made. >> Like I says, it's not against"
322,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,"you personally... Oh, now, you get to decide?"
323,00:19:23.04,00:19:23.04,"You wanted to talk to me, now you want to decide when it's"
324,00:19:25.79,00:19:25.79,over? >> I wanted to talk to you in a
325,00:19:28.50,00:19:28.50,nonconfrontational level where people weren't interjecting.
326,00:19:32.96,00:19:32.96,">> Okay, so you're done with me? >> I'm done with fighting."
327,00:19:37.62,00:19:37.62,"I'm done with everyone. (crying): You know, I'm getting"
328,00:19:41.46,00:19:41.46,kicked in the face. >> No one's kicking you in the
329,00:19:44.50,00:19:44.50,face. Why do you think that?
330,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,>> Because it's just ironic... >> Because we're not saying what
331,00:19:48.17,00:19:48.17,you want to hear. >> ...how you're going to keep
332,00:19:50.21,00:19:50.21,around other liars. There's other...?
333,00:19:51.67,00:19:51.67,">> Who's the other liars? >> I'm not talking to you,"
334,00:19:54.04,00:19:54.04,Erinn. >> I'm just asking who you're
335,00:19:56.50,00:19:56.50,"talking about. If there's liars amongst us,"
336,00:19:58.12,00:19:58.12,"I'd like to know who they are. >> Well, you'd be the last"
337,00:20:00.71,00:20:00.71,"person that I'd tell. >> Oh, so it's like that?"
338,00:20:05.04,00:20:05.04,"Well, I mean, we're just all kind of like... you're saying"
339,00:20:08.17,00:20:08.17,the same thing over and over and over again.
340,00:20:10.21,00:20:10.21,"And, like, I think we're just done hearing it."
341,00:20:20.46,00:20:20.46,>> Okay. As much as Sierra just annoys me
342,00:20:24.04,00:20:24.04,"to death, and I think that she's so dumb, she's right."
343,00:20:30.12,00:20:30.12,Everything she said is totally true.
344,00:20:34.25,00:20:34.25,"Once Sierra's no longer with us, the game will change."
345,00:20:37.58,00:20:37.58,"And I am the one that's going to, like, turn all of this on"
346,00:20:40.46,00:20:40.46,its head. Guilty as charged.
347,00:21:06.75,00:21:06.75,">> Hey, Coach. All I wanted to say was, if you"
348,00:21:09.88,00:21:09.88,"were me, would you just roll over and take it?"
349,00:21:12.46,00:21:12.46,"I mean, yeah, I could just roll over and accept it, but then I"
350,00:21:15.71,00:21:15.71,"guess I wouldn't be me, and I guess you wouldn't expect me to"
351,00:21:19.62,00:21:19.62,do something like that 'cause you'd probably expect more out
352,00:21:22.17,00:21:22.17,of me. I was never going to go hurt
353,00:21:24.33,00:21:24.33,"anyone that I really cared about, and..."
354,00:21:28.17,00:21:28.17,">> Except for me. >> But if... if given, like..."
355,00:21:35.12,00:21:35.12,"I mean, I'm not asking for one, but I'm saying if it sounds"
356,00:21:38.17,00:21:38.17,"practical, if it even sounds possible, given another chance,"
357,00:21:42.42,00:21:42.42,I would prove I am a good person.
358,00:21:45.25,00:21:45.25,I am a loyal person. But if I gave up on myself
359,00:21:48.08,00:21:48.08,"right now, like I want to, I just want to go home, I do."
360,00:21:54.67,00:21:54.67,I don't want to be around a whole bunch of people that...
361,00:21:58.54,00:21:58.54,that I hurt. But I don't want to go out like
362,00:22:02.79,00:22:02.79,"that. >> But I mean, if you're asking"
363,00:22:04.71,00:22:04.71,me would I like to give you a second chance?
364,00:22:06.54,00:22:06.54,Of course I'd like to give you a second chance.
365,00:22:08.38,00:22:08.38,Am I going to you a second chance?
366,00:22:10.29,00:22:10.29,Probably not. This is what I think.
367,00:22:13.04,00:22:13.04,"The honorable thing is to accept your fate, not try"
368,00:22:17.04,00:22:17.04,"to make deals with people. And the samurai warrior, if he"
369,00:22:20.08,00:22:20.08,"did dishonor to himself or his family, you know what he would"
370,00:22:23.12,00:22:23.12,do? He would fall on his sword.
371,00:22:26.33,00:22:26.33,Death before dishonor. You can't change the inevitable.
372,00:22:28.83,00:22:28.83,>> You really want to see Erinn stay here over me?
373,00:22:31.79,00:22:31.79,">> No, but you made your bed. >> Would I be Strong Sierra if"
374,00:22:35.79,00:22:35.79,I didn't have this conversation with you?
375,00:22:39.12,00:22:39.12,"No. Would you be Coach, the one who"
376,00:22:41.96,00:22:41.96,pushed up against me to make me work harder at challenges if
377,00:22:45.75,00:22:45.75,you didn't think that I had that in me?
378,00:22:47.83,00:22:47.83,No. So don't get mad at me for
379,00:22:52.46,00:22:52.46,having this conversation with you.
380,00:22:55.04,00:22:55.04,">> You know, the coach in me is continually looking to those"
381,00:22:58.79,00:22:58.79,that are in need of assistance or encouragement.
382,00:23:02.79,00:23:02.79,"So I see somebody like Sierra, my heart just goes out to her."
383,00:23:08.33,00:23:08.33,>> How do you save the kind enemy?
384,00:23:12.83,00:23:12.83,>> That kills me to have this kid here asking me to throw her
385,00:23:16.21,00:23:16.21,a bone because she's going through so much trials.
386,00:23:19.17,00:23:19.17,"It breaks my heart. >> Would you give up, Coach, if"
387,00:23:23.21,00:23:23.21,"you made the wrong choice? There is a very, very small"
388,00:23:27.38,00:23:27.38,"glimmer of hope, but I most definitely need to win immunity."
389,00:23:30.25,00:23:30.25,I feel it's my only chance of pulling through this.
390,00:23:41.96,00:23:41.96,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Stephen,"
391,00:23:49.00,00:23:49.00,returning from Exile Island. >> Stephen!
392,00:23:52.17,00:23:52.17,">> Hello. Oh, I missed you guys."
393,00:23:54.75,00:23:54.75,I miss body warmth is what I missed.
394,00:23:56.83,00:23:56.83,>> Get in here. We missed you.
395,00:23:59.58,00:23:59.58,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
396,00:24:01.75,00:24:01.75,">> Yes! >> PROBST: First things first,"
397,00:24:03.54,00:24:03.54,"Tyson, take back the necklace. Tyson has had this both times"
398,00:24:09.96,00:24:09.96,it's been up for grabs. Will he get it a third time?
399,00:24:13.62,00:24:13.62,"For today's challenge, you're going to take part in the"
400,00:24:15.83,00:24:15.83,Survivor version of shuffleboard.
401,00:24:18.46,00:24:18.46,You'll each have three pucks. You'll slide your pucks across
402,00:24:22.42,00:24:22.42,the board with one simple goal: the person whose puck ends up
403,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,"closest to the center of the ""X"" wins immunity, and guaranteed"
404,00:24:31.96,00:24:31.96,a one-in-seven shot at winning the million dollars.
405,00:24:37.96,00:24:37.96,Losers goes to Tribal Council where somebody will be voted
406,00:24:40.42,00:24:40.42,out of this game. There is a twist to today's
407,00:24:43.42,00:24:43.42,challenge. If you feel so confident that
408,00:24:47.17,00:24:47.17,"you don't think you need immunity, you can skip"
409,00:24:49.88,00:24:49.88,participating in the challenge and instead...
410,00:24:53.17,00:24:53.17,">> Oh, no... >> PROBST: ...you can eat."
411,00:24:56.96,00:24:56.96,(jubilant shouting) >> PROBST: You're each going to
412,00:25:02.88,00:25:02.88,get a rock. Take a rock.
413,00:25:05.96,00:25:05.96,">> Oh, my God, thank you! >> PROBST: There's no looking."
414,00:25:08.00,00:25:08.00,The rock doesn't mean anything at this point.
415,00:25:11.21,00:25:11.21,"If you want to eat, you're going to show me that rock."
416,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,"If you want to play, you're going to show me an empty hand."
417,00:25:18.12,00:25:18.12,Everybody put your hands out. And reveal.
418,00:25:23.92,00:25:23.92,Stephen says he's going to eat. J.T. says he's going to eat.
419,00:25:27.17,00:25:27.17,Coach says he's going to eat. >> So Coach is hungry enough
420,00:25:31.75,00:25:31.75,"to quit a game and eat pizza. When do I get my pizza, dude?"
421,00:25:35.33,00:25:35.33,"I've been winning all these challenges, you know?"
422,00:25:37.33,00:25:37.33,They should let me have pizza and not worry about sealing the
423,00:25:40.54,00:25:40.54,"deal to get rid of Sierra. >> PROBST: Those of you eating,"
424,00:25:44.54,00:25:44.54,"take a spot at the table. Everybody else, we will draw"
425,00:25:46.88,00:25:46.88,for our order and we'll get started.
426,00:25:54.75,00:25:54.75,"All right, we have our order. This challenge is set to begin."
427,00:25:58.17,00:25:58.17,"J.T., Steve, and Coach, you guys can eat for as long as the"
428,00:26:01.25,00:26:01.25,challenge goes. Start eating.
429,00:26:04.25,00:26:04.25,"Sierra, you're first up. Everybody will have three shots"
430,00:26:08.50,00:26:08.50,and we will rotate the order every round so that nobody is
431,00:26:11.38,00:26:11.38,"ever stuck in the same position. Sierra, a little short."
432,00:26:18.04,00:26:18.04,>> Hmm. >> PROBST: Debbie now up with
433,00:26:20.21,00:26:20.21,"her first shot. Debbie, a little short."
434,00:26:24.71,00:26:24.71,There's a learning curve to this.
435,00:26:26.25,00:26:26.25,(grunting) Use that cold energy and that
436,00:26:29.75,00:26:29.75,shiver. Taj goes a little long.
437,00:26:35.25,00:26:35.25,Erinn with her first shot. Nobody having much luck yet.
438,00:26:41.96,00:26:41.96,All Tyson does is block the road for everybody else.
439,00:26:45.17,00:26:45.17,"Second round: this time, Debbie, you will go first."
440,00:26:47.21,00:26:47.21,>> Oh. >> PROBST: First round didn't
441,00:26:51.08,00:26:51.08,yield much. Debbie with a nice shot.
442,00:26:55.33,00:26:55.33,">> Whoo! >> Come on, Debbie."
443,00:26:56.62,00:26:56.62,>> PROBST: Debbie is now the closest.
444,00:26:59.04,00:26:59.04,Taj with her second shot. Tyson gets a bump from Taj.
445,00:27:06.96,00:27:06.96,Tyson is now the mark to beat. Erinn is up.
446,00:27:13.33,00:27:13.33,Erinn slides inside of Tyson. Erinn is now the closest.
447,00:27:17.46,00:27:17.46,"Tyson now with his second shot. >> Good job, Erinn."
448,00:27:23.54,00:27:23.54,">> PROBST: Tyson, once again, blocks the road."
449,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,Sierra now with her second shot. She's going to have to get past
450,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,Tyson to get a shot at it. Sierra moves Tyson into the
451,00:27:38.33,00:27:38.33,"lead. After two rounds, Tyson is the"
452,00:27:41.75,00:27:41.75,"closest to the ""X."" Everybody has one shot left."
453,00:27:46.33,00:27:46.33,Taj will be first up. >> I can't focus.
454,00:27:53.25,00:27:53.25,"Oh! >> PROBST: Taj, nothing but a"
455,00:27:55.17,00:27:55.17,"sand dune. >> Oh, I should have ate."
456,00:27:58.75,00:27:58.75,>> PROBST: Erinn's now up. Erinn knocks out Sierra's
457,00:28:07.17,00:28:07.17,closest puck. Tyson now up.
458,00:28:11.04,00:28:11.04,"Tyson, your last shot. Tyson increases his lead."
459,00:28:18.42,00:28:18.42,>> Tyson! >> PROBST: Tyson still the mark
460,00:28:21.62,00:28:21.62,to beat. Sierra is up.
461,00:28:25.83,00:28:25.83,"Sierra, you know what you need to do."
462,00:28:27.71,00:28:27.71,"You need to get closer to that ""X"" than Tyson."
463,00:28:35.46,00:28:35.46,Sierra knocks Tyson out and puts herself in position to win
464,00:28:38.12,00:28:38.12,this challenge. Sierra is now the mark to beat.
465,00:28:43.04,00:28:43.04,Huge move. >> When Sierra was doing her
466,00:28:45.88,00:28:45.88,"little dance, I was just like, ""I might have screwed everything"
467,00:28:48.58,00:28:48.58,"up."" Should I have been out there"
468,00:28:50.46,00:28:50.46,"competing? Yeah, I should have been."
469,00:28:52.58,00:28:52.58,>> PROBST: Debbie is now up with her last shot.
470,00:28:55.00,00:28:55.00,">> Oh, Lord. >> PROBST: This is it."
471,00:28:57.33,00:28:57.33,It comes down to this. Sierra will walk away with
472,00:28:59.96,00:28:59.96,"immunity unless Debbie can land closer to that ""X."""
473,00:29:06.79,00:29:06.79,And she does. >> Debbie!
474,00:29:08.42,00:29:08.42,>> PROBST: Debbie wins individual immunity.
475,00:29:10.58,00:29:10.58,(cheering) This challenge is over.
476,00:29:16.54,00:29:16.54,"Drop it, Stephen. Finish what's in your mouth."
477,00:29:18.96,00:29:18.96,"That's it. Debbie, come on over."
478,00:29:23.67,00:29:23.67,">> Oh, yeah! >> Debbie!"
479,00:29:26.17,00:29:26.17,>> PROBST: Middle school principal has a one-in-seven
480,00:29:27.92,00:29:27.92,shot of winning this game. Debbie cannot be voted out
481,00:29:31.17,00:29:31.17,"at tonight's Tribal Council. As for the rest of you, after"
482,00:29:34.21,00:29:34.21,"27 days, one of you going home tonight."
483,00:29:37.50,00:29:37.50,Grab your stuff. I'll see you at Tribal Council.
484,00:29:39.42,00:29:39.42,Congratulations. >> Thank you.
485,00:29:42.12,00:29:42.12,">> What I needed to do today was win that immunity challenge,"
486,00:29:44.58,00:29:44.58,"and it didn't happen. So a part of me is like, ""Maybe"
487,00:29:49.38,00:29:49.38,"that's my fate."" But there's a large part of me"
488,00:29:52.12,00:29:52.12,"that prays for a miracle. >> Debbie, if I would've known"
489,00:30:05.54,00:30:05.54,"you were going to win, I would have sat down and eaten half"
490,00:30:08.08,00:30:08.08,a slice. >> I know.
491,00:30:16.17,00:30:16.17,">> I'm excited. I wanted to win one immunity,"
492,00:30:18.88,00:30:18.88,at least. >> And there's nothing awesomer
493,00:30:25.25,00:30:25.25,than seeing somebody celebrate before the game is over.
494,00:30:27.33,00:30:27.33,>> Yeah. >> I would have liked to have
495,00:30:30.21,00:30:30.21,the immunity necklace again. I thought it would be pretty
496,00:30:33.25,00:30:33.25,badass if I would have worn it for a third time.
497,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,But tonight's Tribal Council is going to be awesome.
498,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,"Um, I'm hoping that Sierra will cry a lot."
499,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,>> I do not want to go to Tribal in the rain.
500,00:30:48.12,00:30:48.12,">> Oh, God. >> Yeah."
501,00:31:01.96,00:31:01.96,">> That's true. >> I mean, this is, like the"
502,00:31:04.12,00:31:04.12,time. It's like opportunity's
503,00:31:05.42,00:31:05.42,knocking. What the hell are we-- you know?
504,00:31:07.42,00:31:07.42,">> I know. >> See, get... talk to J.T."
505,00:31:14.58,00:31:14.58,Let me know what y'all want to do.
506,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,I'm willing to do whatever y'all want to do.
507,00:31:21.21,00:31:21.21,"You're a hundred percent with us, right?"
508,00:31:23.96,00:31:23.96,"Okay, okay. >> Tyson is such a physical"
509,00:31:28.12,00:31:28.12,"competitor, that he may win every challenge out here."
510,00:31:31.75,00:31:31.75,"We got lucky today and someone else won, so we have to get rid"
511,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,"of Tyson. Um, and this might just be the"
512,00:31:38.54,00:31:38.54,chance to do it. It could be Tyson or Sierra
513,00:31:42.96,00:31:42.96,tonight. This is not an easy decision.
514,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,But I know that there's no way I can win this game by just
515,00:31:50.46,00:31:50.46,kind of hanging out and letting other people make my decisions.
516,00:31:54.33,00:31:54.33,This move is potentially a very pivotal one.
517,00:32:16.21,00:32:16.21,>> I wouldn't worry. >> I'd hate to make it this
518,00:32:18.08,00:32:18.08,early 'cause we don't want to get stuck with Sierra.
519,00:32:24.75,00:32:24.75,>> You know it happens. It happens every season.
520,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,Someone goes on a run. Let's make it you.
521,00:32:32.96,00:32:32.96,">> It'd be a lot safer, wouldn't it?"
522,00:32:34.46,00:32:34.46,>> Yeah. >> No.
523,00:32:42.21,00:32:42.21,Sierra is. >> Sierra is a lying bitch and
524,00:32:47.88,00:32:47.88,"I hate her. >> I hate her, too."
525,00:32:49.33,00:32:49.33,">> I want to get her away from my face, dude."
526,00:32:51.88,00:32:51.88,If we stick through with this plan that we're talking about
527,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"now-- Stephen, myself, Erinn, and Taj."
528,00:32:56.17,00:32:56.17,"If we get rid of Tyson, we could do it without talking to Sierra"
529,00:33:00.29,00:33:00.29,"'cause we have the numbers, but it's going to go against the"
530,00:33:04.46,00:33:04.46,warrior alliance that Coach has worked so hard to build here.
531,00:33:07.42,00:33:07.42,So it's going to be a tough decision.
532,00:33:10.21,00:33:10.21,>> We going to recap the plan. >> Okay.
533,00:33:13.04,00:33:13.04,">> Sierra's going tonight, no-brainer."
534,00:33:14.50,00:33:14.50,>> Okay. >> One of my top priorities
535,00:33:17.21,00:33:17.21,right now at this point is to go to the five with the warrior
536,00:33:21.54,00:33:21.54,alliance. It would be ... stupid if we
537,00:33:25.00,00:33:25.00,"made an alliance, gave it a name, bandied the name about,"
538,00:33:29.54,00:33:29.54,"talked about ourselves being warriors, and then chickened out"
539,00:33:32.12,00:33:32.12,at the last second. I know I can trust you and
540,00:33:34.46,00:33:34.46,"that's so important to me, man. >> You have my word."
541,00:33:37.08,00:33:37.08,>> There you go. >> It's really going to crush
542,00:33:40.50,00:33:40.50,Coach if I go through with this move to get rid of Tyson.
543,00:33:43.96,00:33:43.96,It's really going to crush him. I don't know what I'm going to
544,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,"do, man. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
545,00:34:05.08,00:34:05.08,"the first member of our jury. Brendan, voted out at the last"
546,00:34:12.33,00:34:12.33,"Tribal Council. At the last Tribal Council,"
547,00:34:20.38,00:34:20.38,"Brendan was blindsided. Sierra, you looked stunned."
548,00:34:24.62,00:34:24.62,">> Uh, yeah, and, unfortunately, I'll probably go home due to the"
549,00:34:28.79,00:34:28.79,"choices that I made, but if it's my time, it's my time, and, uh,"
550,00:34:32.54,00:34:32.54,no one here is blindsiding me today.
551,00:34:36.75,00:34:36.75,">> PROBST: Tyson, in spite of not having immunity tonight,"
552,00:34:39.21,00:34:39.21,"concerned it could be you, or are you feeling pretty"
553,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,"comfortable tonight? >> Yeah, I'm feeling pretty"
554,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,comfortable. The people I've aligned myself
555,00:34:46.08,00:34:46.08,with are the people I trust. I'm also happy that Debbie won.
556,00:34:49.08,00:34:49.08,"When you can't win yourself, it's nice to see someone you"
557,00:34:51.54,00:34:51.54,"love win. >> Thank you, Tyson."
558,00:34:53.62,00:34:53.62,">> PROBST: J.T., a little hard to hear that?"
559,00:34:55.54,00:34:55.54,"Tyson saying, ""Well, if I can't win, I'm glad Debbie won."""
560,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,"He didn't say, ""I'm glad..."" >> Well, I said ""someone I"
561,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,"love."" It's not to say she's the only"
562,00:35:02.21,00:35:02.21,one I love here. >> PROBST: Who else do you love
563,00:35:04.17,00:35:04.17,"here? >> Um, Debbie, Coach, Stephen,"
564,00:35:07.75,00:35:07.75,"Taj, Erinn, J.T., Brendan. >> PROBST: So your vote's pretty"
565,00:35:14.29,00:35:14.29,clear. You're voting Sierra.
566,00:35:16.17,00:35:16.17,">> Yes. >> PROBST: Sierra, do you think"
567,00:35:18.42,00:35:18.42,people are telling you you're going to be voted out because
568,00:35:21.12,00:35:21.12,"they want to appear nice, so that when you're on the jury,"
569,00:35:23.67,00:35:23.67,you'll consider voting for them if they make it to the end?
570,00:35:26.21,00:35:26.21,">> No, it was kind of obvious the moment that Brendan went"
571,00:35:28.79,00:35:28.79,out that I was next. What I was trying to tell them
572,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"was that in the alliance that I made with someone else, I"
573,00:35:35.08,00:35:35.08,probably spoke to that person about what we were planning on
574,00:35:38.33,00:35:38.33,doing... >> PROBST: I don't know what
575,00:35:40.62,00:35:40.62,you're talking about. >> What do you mean?
576,00:35:42.08,00:35:42.08,>> Nobody does. >> Tyson!
577,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,>> I know what she's saying. You want me to explain it?
578,00:35:46.42,00:35:46.42,">> No, I don't need you to explain it for me, Tyson."
579,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,What I'm explaining is... >> PROBST: What's going on
580,00:35:51.54,00:35:51.54,between you and Tyson? >> Tyson always likes to badger
581,00:35:53.62,00:35:53.62,"me, and that's the way that Tyson is."
582,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,He's kind of a smartass. I don't think half the things
583,00:35:58.08,00:35:58.08,he has to say are very funny. But he's never been really nice
584,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,"to me and that's fine. >> PROBST: Tyson, is that true?"
585,00:36:04.21,00:36:04.21,Have you and Sierra butted heads from the beginning?
586,00:36:06.58,00:36:06.58,>> I've never really felt a close bond with Sierra.
587,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"I mean, tried to be friendly and cordial, but when I'm done"
588,00:36:11.75,00:36:11.75,"listening to her talk, I'm done listening."
589,00:36:14.58,00:36:14.58,>> PROBST: Are you concerned at all that that kind of an
590,00:36:16.96,00:36:16.96,attitude could cost in this game?
591,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,>> I told her I'd give her five minutes and I did.
592,00:36:21.12,00:36:21.12,"And she kept going. And, I mean, I was irritated at"
593,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,what her and Brendan had tried to do.
594,00:36:26.38,00:36:26.38,So I don't know why I need to give her all the courtesy
595,00:36:28.88,00:36:28.88,"and she give me none. >> Um, well, this is a game"
596,00:36:31.58,00:36:31.58,about strengths and weaknesses. It's not a personality contest.
597,00:36:35.29,00:36:35.29,"The thing is, he's really strong in challenges, and if you want"
598,00:36:38.04,00:36:38.04,"to take someone strong all the way to the final two, like, so"
599,00:36:41.21,00:36:41.21,be it. But he is really strong.
600,00:36:44.79,00:36:44.79,I wouldn't be voting him out because we didn't get along as
601,00:36:47.46,00:36:47.46,two people. I'd be voting him out so that I
602,00:36:49.79,00:36:49.79,could win a reward challenge or so that someone else that I
603,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,aligned with could win another challenge.
604,00:36:54.12,00:36:54.12,It's just the way that the game works.
605,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,">> Coach, Sierra brings up a good point."
606,00:36:58.88,00:36:58.88,Tyson won the first two immunity challenges.
607,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,He doesn't have immunity tonight.
608,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,"Is he a threat? And if so, why not take him out"
609,00:37:05.38,00:37:05.38,tonight? >> I've said from the very
610,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,beginning that I wanted to walk the path of the noble warrior
611,00:37:10.25,00:37:10.25,and finding that great competition that you can pit
612,00:37:13.29,00:37:13.29,yourself against. >> PROBST: And then you voted
613,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,out Brendan. >> Yeah.
614,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,>> I will explain this to you. >> PROBST: I'm sure you will.
615,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,>> Because Brendan pitted himself against me.
616,00:37:23.71,00:37:23.71,"If it's war, one-on-one... >> PROBST: I thought that's what"
617,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"you wanted? >> Exactly, and I won."
618,00:37:27.33,00:37:27.33,Thank you. Exactly.
619,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,"I outsmarted him. I outfoxed him, and at the"
620,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,"moment, sorry to say, I'm outleading him."
621,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,>> PROBST: Okay. >> So I won that battle.
622,00:37:36.79,00:37:36.79,"Now, as far as the other people, if I'm going to have trust in"
623,00:37:39.58,00:37:39.58,"this tribe, we are going to be on the same page."
624,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,And we are going to battle each other in an honorable fashion.
625,00:37:45.29,00:37:45.29,"If I give them my word, I'm not going to go back on that."
626,00:37:49.33,00:37:49.33,>> PROBST: So an honorable battle to you then means as long
627,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,"as we both agree on how we're going to play this, I'll battle"
628,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,you. >> Absolutely.
629,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,I will be a ravenous wolf for anybody that wants to go
630,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,"head-to-head with me, and I will cut them off at the knees with"
631,00:38:02.96,00:38:02.96,"no remorse and no regret. >> PROBST: J.T., what do you"
632,00:38:06.83,00:38:06.83,"make of having the best ""battle it out to the end""?"
633,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,>> Coach said he was going to change the game.
634,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,He's definitely changing it. I've never seen anyone take the
635,00:38:14.71,00:38:14.71,"best competitors to the end. When he gives me his word,"
636,00:38:17.21,00:38:17.21,I take it to the bank. There's no doubt about it.
637,00:38:19.83,00:38:19.83,">> PROBST: Coach, if J.T. gives you his word, do you take it to"
638,00:38:22.33,00:38:22.33,the bank? >> The first time I looked in
639,00:38:24.25,00:38:24.25,"J.T.'s eyes and I shook his hand, I knew that where he comes"
640,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,"from, that meant something. And I see honesty and trust."
641,00:38:30.38,00:38:30.38,"And I see a warrior in battle. That's somebody, obviously, that"
642,00:38:33.71,00:38:33.71,I respect and I believe a hundred percent when he tells me
643,00:38:36.25,00:38:36.25,"something. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
644,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,"get to the vote. Debbie, you have immunity."
645,00:38:41.71,00:38:41.71,You can give that up to somebody else or keep it for
646,00:38:43.67,00:38:43.67,yourself. >> I think I'll wear it proudly
647,00:38:45.04,00:38:45.04,tonight. >> PROBST: You cannot vote for
648,00:38:46.96,00:38:46.96,Debbie. Everybody else is fair game.
649,00:38:48.46,00:38:48.46,"It is time to vote. Tyson, you're up."
650,00:39:11.75,00:39:11.75,">> Last week, Sierra, I slayed the dragon."
651,00:39:14.17,00:39:14.17,This week I had to take care of his bride.
652,00:39:17.21,00:39:17.21,"Good night, sweet princess. >> You're a jerk."
653,00:39:54.17,00:39:54.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
654,00:40:02.38,00:40:02.38,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
655,00:40:04.83,00:40:04.83,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
656,00:40:10.21,00:40:10.21,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
657,00:40:12.50,00:40:12.50,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
658,00:40:14.83,00:40:14.83,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
659,00:40:20.12,00:40:20.12,First vote... Sierra. Tyson.
660,00:40:32.12,00:40:32.12,Sierra. Two votes Sierra;
661,00:40:34.25,00:40:34.25,one vote Tyson. Sierra.
662,00:40:40.21,00:40:40.21,Three votes Sierra; one vote Tyson.
663,00:40:45.25,00:40:45.25,Tyson. Three votes Sierra;
664,00:40:48.21,00:40:48.21,two votes Tyson. Tyson.
665,00:40:54.12,00:40:54.12,We're tied. That's three votes Sierra;
666,00:40:56.33,00:40:56.33,three votes Tyson. Tyson.
667,00:41:06.17,00:41:06.17,That's four votes Tyson; three votes Sierra.
668,00:41:09.25,00:41:09.25,One vote left. Ninth person voted out and the
669,00:41:19.04,00:41:19.04,second member of our jury: Tyson.
670,00:41:23.25,00:41:23.25,"You need to bring me your torch. Tyson, the tribe has spoken."
671,00:41:39.75,00:41:39.75,"Time for you to go. Another Tribal Council,"
672,00:41:52.25,00:41:52.25,another blindside. This is shaping up to be a
673,00:41:55.38,00:41:55.38,battle to the end. Grab your torches.
674,00:41:58.54,00:41:58.54,Head back to camp. Good night.

685,00:42:29.38,00:42:29.38,at Sierra's mercy. >> I thought you said you were

687,00:42:33.46,00:42:33.46,last night. >> I'm going to ask you this
688,00:42:35.12,00:42:35.12,"again, Sierra: where's your loyalty right now?"
689,00:42:42.38,00:42:42.38,>> Sneaky bastards. Now I know how Brendan feels.
690,00:42:45.25,00:42:45.25,"Yeah, it was a big shock. I thought I had my game in the"
691,00:42:48.17,00:42:48.17,"bag, but I should've probably not been quite as confident or"
692,00:42:50.25,00:42:50.25,"so, uh, gullible. Good luck to everybody."
693,00:42:52.67,00:42:52.67,I guess everybody deserves to be there.
694,00:42:54.04,00:42:54.04,You beat me. That's a huge accomplishment.
695,00:42:55.75,00:42:55.75,That bothers me that Sierra will be here longer than me.
696,00:42:58.17,00:42:58.17,"A little weird being outfoxed by an idiot, but I'm not crying"
697,00:43:01.00,00:43:01.00,over it.
