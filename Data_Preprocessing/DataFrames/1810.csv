377,00:22:47.83,00:22:47.83,No.So don't get mad at me for
378,00:22:52.46,00:22:52.46,having this conversation withyou.
379,00:22:55.04,00:22:55.04,">> You know, the coach in me iscontinually looking to those"

381,00:23:02.79,00:23:02.79,"So I see somebody like Sierra,my heart just goes out to her."
382,00:23:08.33,00:23:08.33,>> How do you save the kindenemy?
383,00:23:12.83,00:23:12.83,>> That kills me to have thiskid here asking me to throw her
384,00:23:16.21,00:23:16.21,a bone because she's goingthrough so much trials.
385,00:23:19.17,00:23:19.17,"It breaks my heart.>> Would you give up, Coach, if"
386,00:23:23.21,00:23:23.21,"you made the wrong choice?There is a very, very small"
387,00:23:27.38,00:23:27.38,"glimmer of hope, but I mostdefinitely need to win immunity."
388,00:23:30.25,00:23:30.25,I feel it's my only chance ofpulling through this.
389,00:23:41.96,00:23:41.96,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys!We'll now bring in Stephen,"
390,00:23:49.00,00:23:49.00,returning from Exile Island.>> Stephen!

401,00:24:22.42,00:24:22.42,the board with one simple goal:the person whose puck ends up
402,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,"closest to the center of the ""X""wins immunity, and guaranteed"
403,00:24:31.96,00:24:31.96,a one-in-seven shot at winningthe million dollars.

413,00:25:08.00,00:25:08.00,The rock doesn't mean anythingat this point.

420,00:25:35.33,00:25:35.33,"I've been winning all thesechallenges, you know?"
421,00:25:37.33,00:25:37.33,They should let me have pizzaand not worry about sealing the

433,00:26:24.71,00:26:24.71,There's a learning curve tothis.
434,00:26:26.25,00:26:26.25,(grunting)Use that cold energy and that
435,00:26:29.75,00:26:29.75,shiver.Taj goes a little long.
436,00:26:35.25,00:26:35.25,Erinn with her first shot.Nobody having much luck yet.
437,00:26:41.96,00:26:41.96,All Tyson does is block theroad for everybody else.

463,00:28:38.12,00:28:38.12,this challenge.Sierra is now the mark to beat.
464,00:28:43.04,00:28:43.04,Huge move.>> When Sierra was doing her
465,00:28:45.88,00:28:45.88,"little dance, I was just like,""I might have screwed everything"
466,00:28:48.58,00:28:48.58,"up.""Should I have been out there"

485,00:29:44.58,00:29:44.58,"and it didn't happen.So a part of me is like, ""Maybe"

487,00:29:52.12,00:29:52.12,"that prays for a miracle.>> Debbie, if I would've known"

492,00:30:25.25,00:30:25.25,than seeing somebody celebratebefore the game is over.
493,00:30:27.33,00:30:27.33,>> Yeah.>> I would have liked to have
494,00:30:30.21,00:30:30.21,the immunity necklace again.I thought it would be pretty
495,00:30:33.25,00:30:33.25,badass if I would have worn itfor a third time.
496,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,But tonight's Tribal Council isgoing to be awesome.
497,00:30:39.00,00:30:39.00,"Um, I'm hoping that Sierra willcry a lot."
498,00:30:45.21,00:30:45.21,>> I do not want to go toTribal in the rain.

501,00:31:04.12,00:31:04.12,time.It's like opportunity's
502,00:31:05.42,00:31:05.42,knocking.What the hell are we-- you know?
503,00:31:07.42,00:31:07.42,">> I know.>> See, get... talk to J.T."
504,00:31:14.58,00:31:14.58,Let me know what y'all want todo.
505,00:31:16.50,00:31:16.50,I'm willing to do whatever y'allwant to do.
506,00:31:21.21,00:31:21.21,"You're a hundred percent withus, right?"
507,00:31:23.96,00:31:23.96,"Okay, okay.>> Tyson is such a physical"
508,00:31:28.12,00:31:28.12,"competitor, that he may winevery challenge out here."
509,00:31:31.75,00:31:31.75,"We got lucky today and someoneelse won, so we have to get rid"
510,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,"of Tyson.Um, and this might just be the"
511,00:31:38.54,00:31:38.54,chance to do it.It could be Tyson or Sierra
512,00:31:42.96,00:31:42.96,tonight.This is not an easy decision.
513,00:31:46.17,00:31:46.17,But I know that there's no wayI can win this game by just
514,00:31:50.46,00:31:50.46,kind of hanging out and lettingother people make my decisions.
515,00:31:54.33,00:31:54.33,This move is potentially a verypivotal one.
516,00:32:16.21,00:32:16.21,>> I wouldn't worry.>> I'd hate to make it this
517,00:32:18.08,00:32:18.08,early 'cause we don't want toget stuck with Sierra.
518,00:32:24.75,00:32:24.75,>> You know it happens.It happens every season.
519,00:32:26.71,00:32:26.71,Someone goes on a run.Let's make it you.
520,00:32:32.96,00:32:32.96,">> It'd be a lot safer,wouldn't it?"
521,00:32:34.46,00:32:34.46,>> Yeah.>> No.
522,00:32:42.21,00:32:42.21,Sierra is.>> Sierra is a lying bitch and
523,00:32:47.88,00:32:47.88,"I hate her.>> I hate her, too."
524,00:32:49.33,00:32:49.33,">> I want to get her away frommy face, dude."
525,00:32:51.88,00:32:51.88,If we stick through with thisplan that we're talking about
526,00:32:54.21,00:32:54.21,"now-- Stephen, myself, Erinn,and Taj."
527,00:32:56.17,00:32:56.17,"If we get rid of Tyson, we coulddo it without talking to Sierra"
528,00:33:00.29,00:33:00.29,"'cause we have the numbers, butit's going to go against the"
529,00:33:04.46,00:33:04.46,warrior alliance that Coach hasworked so hard to build here.
530,00:33:07.42,00:33:07.42,So it's going to be a toughdecision.
531,00:33:10.21,00:33:10.21,>> We going to recap the plan.>> Okay.
532,00:33:13.04,00:33:13.04,">> Sierra's going tonight,no-brainer."
533,00:33:14.50,00:33:14.50,>> Okay.>> One of my top priorities
534,00:33:17.21,00:33:17.21,right now at this point is togo to the five with the warrior
535,00:33:21.54,00:33:21.54,alliance.It would be ... stupid if we
536,00:33:25.00,00:33:25.00,"made an alliance, gave it aname, bandied the name about,"
537,00:33:29.54,00:33:29.54,"talked about ourselves beingwarriors, and then chickened out"
538,00:33:32.12,00:33:32.12,at the last second.I know I can trust you and
539,00:33:34.46,00:33:34.46,"that's so important to me, man.>> You have my word."
540,00:33:37.08,00:33:37.08,>> There you go.>> It's really going to crush
541,00:33:40.50,00:33:40.50,Coach if I go through with thismove to get rid of Tyson.
542,00:33:43.96,00:33:43.96,It's really going to crush him.I don't know what I'm going to
543,00:33:48.50,00:33:48.50,"do, man.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
544,00:34:05.08,00:34:05.08,"the first member of our jury.Brendan, voted out at the last"
545,00:34:12.33,00:34:12.33,"Tribal Council.At the last Tribal Council,"
546,00:34:20.38,00:34:20.38,"Brendan was blindsided.Sierra, you looked stunned."
547,00:34:24.62,00:34:24.62,">> Uh, yeah, and, unfortunately,I'll probably go home due to the"
548,00:34:28.79,00:34:28.79,"choices that I made, but if it'smy time, it's my time, and, uh,"
549,00:34:32.54,00:34:32.54,no one here is blindsiding metoday.
550,00:34:36.75,00:34:36.75,">> PROBST: Tyson, in spite ofnot having immunity tonight,"
551,00:34:39.21,00:34:39.21,"concerned it could be you, orare you feeling pretty"

553,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,comfortable.The people I've aligned myself
554,00:34:46.08,00:34:46.08,with are the people I trust.I'm also happy that Debbie won.
555,00:34:49.08,00:34:49.08,"When you can't win yourself,it's nice to see someone you"
556,00:34:51.54,00:34:51.54,"love win.>> Thank you, Tyson."
557,00:34:53.62,00:34:53.62,">> PROBST: J.T., a little hardto hear that?"

559,00:34:58.17,00:34:58.17,"He didn't say, ""I'm glad..."">> Well, I said ""someone I"

565,00:35:16.17,00:35:16.17,">> Yes.>> PROBST: Sierra, do you think"
566,00:35:18.42,00:35:18.42,people are telling you you'regoing to be voted out because
567,00:35:21.12,00:35:21.12,"they want to appear nice, sothat when you're on the jury,"
568,00:35:23.67,00:35:23.67,you'll consider voting for themif they make it to the end?
569,00:35:26.21,00:35:26.21,">> No, it was kind of obviousthe moment that Brendan went"
570,00:35:28.79,00:35:28.79,out that I was next.What I was trying to tell them
571,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"was that in the alliance that Imade with someone else, I"
572,00:35:35.08,00:35:35.08,probably spoke to that personabout what we were planning on
573,00:35:38.33,00:35:38.33,doing...>> PROBST: I don't know what
574,00:35:40.62,00:35:40.62,you're talking about.>> What do you mean?
575,00:35:42.08,00:35:42.08,>> Nobody does.>> Tyson!
576,00:35:44.08,00:35:44.08,>> I know what she's saying.You want me to explain it?
577,00:35:46.42,00:35:46.42,">> No, I don't need you toexplain it for me, Tyson."
578,00:35:49.21,00:35:49.21,What I'm explaining is...>> PROBST: What's going on
579,00:35:51.54,00:35:51.54,between you and Tyson?>> Tyson always likes to badger
580,00:35:53.62,00:35:53.62,"me, and that's the way thatTyson is."
581,00:35:55.50,00:35:55.50,He's kind of a smartass.I don't think half the things
582,00:35:58.08,00:35:58.08,he has to say are very funny.But he's never been really nice
583,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,"to me and that's fine.>> PROBST: Tyson, is that true?"
584,00:36:04.21,00:36:04.21,Have you and Sierra buttedheads from the beginning?
585,00:36:06.58,00:36:06.58,>> I've never really felt aclose bond with Sierra.
586,00:36:09.08,00:36:09.08,"I mean, tried to be friendlyand cordial, but when I'm done"
587,00:36:11.75,00:36:11.75,"listening to her talk, I'm donelistening."
588,00:36:14.58,00:36:14.58,>> PROBST: Are you concerned atall that that kind of an
589,00:36:16.96,00:36:16.96,attitude could cost in thisgame?
590,00:36:18.71,00:36:18.71,>> I told her I'd give her fiveminutes and I did.
591,00:36:21.12,00:36:21.12,"And she kept going.And, I mean, I was irritated at"
592,00:36:24.08,00:36:24.08,what her and Brendan had triedto do.
593,00:36:26.38,00:36:26.38,So I don't know why I needto give her all the courtesy
594,00:36:28.88,00:36:28.88,"and she give me none.>> Um, well, this is a game"
595,00:36:31.58,00:36:31.58,about strengths and weaknesses.It's not a personality contest.
596,00:36:35.29,00:36:35.29,"The thing is, he's really strongin challenges, and if you want"
597,00:36:38.04,00:36:38.04,"to take someone strong all theway to the final two, like, so"
598,00:36:41.21,00:36:41.21,be it.But he is really strong.
599,00:36:44.79,00:36:44.79,I wouldn't be voting him outbecause we didn't get along as
600,00:36:47.46,00:36:47.46,two people.I'd be voting him out so that I
601,00:36:49.79,00:36:49.79,could win a reward challenge orso that someone else that I
602,00:36:52.21,00:36:52.21,aligned with could win anotherchallenge.
603,00:36:54.12,00:36:54.12,It's just the way that the gameworks.
604,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,">> Coach, Sierra brings up agood point."
605,00:36:58.88,00:36:58.88,Tyson won the first twoimmunity challenges.
606,00:37:01.25,00:37:01.25,He doesn't have immunitytonight.
607,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,"Is he a threat?And if so, why not take him out"
608,00:37:05.38,00:37:05.38,tonight?>> I've said from the very
609,00:37:07.12,00:37:07.12,beginning that I wanted to walkthe path of the noble warrior
610,00:37:10.25,00:37:10.25,and finding that greatcompetition that you can pit
611,00:37:13.29,00:37:13.29,yourself against.>> PROBST: And then you voted
612,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,out Brendan.>> Yeah.
613,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,>> I will explain this to you.>> PROBST: I'm sure you will.
614,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,>> Because Brendan pittedhimself against me.
615,00:37:23.71,00:37:23.71,"If it's war, one-on-one...>> PROBST: I thought that's what"
616,00:37:25.67,00:37:25.67,"you wanted?>> Exactly, and I won."
617,00:37:27.33,00:37:27.33,Thank you.Exactly.
618,00:37:29.83,00:37:29.83,"I outsmarted him.I outfoxed him, and at the"
619,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,"moment, sorry to say, I'moutleading him."
620,00:37:34.75,00:37:34.75,>> PROBST: Okay.>> So I won that battle.
621,00:37:36.79,00:37:36.79,"Now, as far as the other people,if I'm going to have trust in"
622,00:37:39.58,00:37:39.58,"this tribe, we are going to beon the same page."
623,00:37:42.29,00:37:42.29,And we are going to battle eachother in an honorable fashion.
624,00:37:45.29,00:37:45.29,"If I give them my word, I'm notgoing to go back on that."
625,00:37:49.33,00:37:49.33,>> PROBST: So an honorablebattle to you then means as long
626,00:37:52.62,00:37:52.62,"as we both agree on how we'regoing to play this, I'll battle"
627,00:37:55.21,00:37:55.21,you.>> Absolutely.
628,00:37:57.08,00:37:57.08,I will be a ravenous wolf foranybody that wants to go
629,00:38:00.12,00:38:00.12,"head-to-head with me, and I willcut them off at the knees with"
630,00:38:02.96,00:38:02.96,"no remorse and no regret.>> PROBST: J.T., what do you"
631,00:38:06.83,00:38:06.83,"make of having the best ""battleit out to the end""?"
632,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,>> Coach said he was going tochange the game.
633,00:38:12.17,00:38:12.17,He's definitely changing it.I've never seen anyone take the
634,00:38:14.71,00:38:14.71,"best competitors to the end.When he gives me his word,"
635,00:38:17.21,00:38:17.21,I take it to the bank.There's no doubt about it.
636,00:38:19.83,00:38:19.83,">> PROBST: Coach, if J.T. givesyou his word, do you take it to"
637,00:38:22.33,00:38:22.33,the bank?>> The first time I looked in
638,00:38:24.25,00:38:24.25,"J.T.'s eyes and I shook hishand, I knew that where he comes"
639,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,"from, that meant something.And I see honesty and trust."
640,00:38:30.38,00:38:30.38,"And I see a warrior in battle.That's somebody, obviously, that"
641,00:38:33.71,00:38:33.71,I respect and I believe ahundred percent when he tells me
642,00:38:36.25,00:38:36.25,"something.>> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
643,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,"get to the vote.Debbie, you have immunity."
644,00:38:41.71,00:38:41.71,You can give that up tosomebody else or keep it for
645,00:38:43.67,00:38:43.67,yourself.>> I think I'll wear it proudly
646,00:38:45.04,00:38:45.04,tonight.>> PROBST: You cannot vote for
647,00:38:46.96,00:38:46.96,Debbie.Everybody else is fair game.
