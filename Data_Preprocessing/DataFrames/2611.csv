451,00:28:37.30,00:28:37.30,GUARANTEED A 1-8 SHOT AT WINNING THIS GAME.

455,00:28:47.20,00:28:47.20,DAY SO I'D LIKE TO THINK I'VE INFUSED SOME SORT OF
456,00:28:49.90,00:28:49.90,REVOLUTIONARY SPIRIT IN THESE GUYS AND
457,00:28:52.93,00:28:52.93,THEY'LL REALIZE AT NINE THE THREE OF US CAN BE HELP TO
458,00:28:55.10,00:28:55.10,SOMEBODY TRYING TO SHAKE THINGS UP.
459,00:29:16.37,00:29:16.37,">> Jeff: I AM THE GREATER CHALLENGER IN ""SURVIVOR"""

461,00:29:26.13,00:29:26.13,I'VE WON HALF THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGES.
462,00:29:28.43,00:29:28.43,I'M THE GUY THAT WAS SCREAMED AT AFTER EVERY CHALLENGE I PLAYED
463,00:29:31.90,00:29:31.90,"BECAUSE I'M SUCH A LIABILITY, I SUCK AT CHALLENGES, I'M WEAK."
464,00:29:34.60,00:29:34.60,BUT NOW I AM THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THREAT IN THIS GAME
465,00:29:37.13,00:29:37.13,AND I DON'T CARE IF IT MAKES ME A THREAT.
466,00:29:39.53,00:29:39.53,I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP WINNING. >> I'M NERVOUS.
467,00:29:54.47,00:29:54.47,IDOLS DRIVE YOU CRAZY OUT HERE. I FOUND TWO WITHOUT CLUES AND
468,00:29:57.57,00:29:57.57,NOW I CAN'T FIND THE ONE THAT I PAID $480 FOR A CLUE TO AND I
469,00:30:01.57,00:30:01.57,CAN'T GO LOOK FOR IT BECAUSE I'LL JUST BE HOUNDED BY THE
470,00:30:04.70,00:30:04.70,GIRLS. THEY'LL START DIGGING AROUND ME
471,00:30:06.40,00:30:06.40,LITERALLY. I'VE JUST GOT TO BLUFF MY WAY
472,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,THROUGH THIS BASICALLY. >> WE NEED THEM TO THINK WE'RE
473,00:30:10.77,00:30:10.77,PLAYING AN IDOL. >> DID YOU GET IT.

477,00:30:22.10,00:30:22.10,SCENARIO BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE'VE GOT SHERRI AND IF I HAVE SHERRI
478,00:30:24.43,00:30:24.43,"AND THEY SPLIT THE VOTE NO MATTER HOW THEY PLAY IT, 3-3,"
479,00:30:27.63,00:30:27.63,WE'RE GOOD WITH FOUR VOTES. I TRUST YOU AND I LIKE YOU SO
480,00:30:37.10,00:30:37.10,THEY HAVE TO SPLIT THE VOTE BECAUSE I GOT THE IDOL.
481,00:30:40.40,00:30:40.40,>> YOU HAVE ONE IDOL? >> SO NO MATTER WHAT THEY HAVE
482,00:30:44.53,00:30:44.53,TO SPLIT THE VOTE OR ELSE I CAN PLAY THAT THING.
483,00:30:47.33,00:30:47.33,"ARE WE GOING TO MAKE A DEAL OR NOT, SORRY?"
484,00:30:52.30,00:30:52.30,I'LL GO TO THE END WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.
485,00:30:54.07,00:30:54.07,I'M TELLING YOU. >> BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
486,00:30:56.47,00:30:56.47,GET RID OF ONE OF THEM. >> I KNOW.
487,00:30:58.20,00:30:58.20,>> I THINK I WANT TO PLAY WITH THE MUSCLE HEADS BECAUSE I THINK
488,00:31:00.43,00:31:00.43,THE MUSCLE HEADS ARE GOING TO KEEP WINNING THE CHALLENGES.
489,00:31:02.60,00:31:02.60,"BUT THEN I FLIP AND I GO, BUT COCHRAN WON ONE TODAY."
490,00:31:06.10,00:31:06.10,BUT COCHRAN WON ONE BECAUSE HE HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

492,00:31:13.13,00:31:13.13,>> NO BUT HE'S GOING TO BE FIVE. >> IF YOU'RE WITH US THAT'S GOOD
493,00:31:18.77,00:31:18.77,AS LONG AS THEY KNOW I HAVE AN IDOL.

506,00:32:03.17,00:32:03.17,OTHER SIDE. I NEED TO KNOW AS MUCH
507,00:32:05.10,00:32:05.10,INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE. SO I HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING BOTH
508,00:32:08.33,00:32:08.33,SIDES WHICH I'M EXCITED ABOUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M
509,00:32:11.53,00:32:11.53,TERRIFIED. >> I TRUST YOU.

521,00:32:42.00,00:32:42.00,ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL I KNOW THE NAME I'M ABOUT TO WRITE DOWN AND
522,00:32:45.03,00:32:45.03,IT MIGHT EVEN CHANGE AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

560,00:34:52.10,00:34:52.10,ANYTHING UP? >> I THINK PHILLIP'S DEPARTURE
561,00:34:54.60,00:34:54.60,MARKED A NEW CHAPTER IN THE GAME AND I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE 6-3
562,00:35:01.63,00:35:01.63,ANYMORE BECAUSE IN THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T MAKE MOVES YOU MIGHT
563,00:35:04.00,00:35:04.00,BE DOOMED TO BE GOING HOME SOONER THAN YOU THOUGHT.
564,00:35:07.07,00:35:07.07,">> Jeff: ANDREA, A LITTLE UNNERVING WHEN YOU HEAR ONE OF"

574,00:35:37.23,00:35:37.23,RATIONALE COULD BE I'M NOT GETTING TO THE END WITH THE SIX
575,00:35:39.13,00:35:39.13,BECAUSE I ALREADY FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE BOTTOM.
576,00:35:41.13,00:35:41.13,>> ABSOLUTELY THAT'S CROSSED MY MIND.
577,00:35:43.33,00:35:43.33,WHO KNOWS WHERE I SIT WITH THE FAVORITES?

583,00:35:59.23,00:35:59.23,AND I THINK IN SHERRI'S CASE I HOPE SHE'S NOT THINKING SHE'S ON
