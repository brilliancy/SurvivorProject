668,00:34:25.38,00:34:25.38,SHE STARTED PANICKING.
669,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,IT JUST WASN'T COMING TOGETHERFOR HER.
670,00:34:28.38,00:34:28.38,"DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND, REALLYCAME THROUGH FOR US."

674,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,">> IN MY EYES, YOU KNOW, I DON'TTRUST DAVID."
675,00:34:47.42,00:34:47.42,>> I DON'T TRUST HIM AT ALL.

677,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,"BEEN SUPER, SUPER WEAK AT EVERYCHALLENGE."
678,00:34:54.29,00:34:54.29,SHE TENDS TO GET FLUSTERED ANDFREAKED OUT A LITTLE BIT.
679,00:34:57.67,00:34:57.67,"SHE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THATINTESTINAL FORTITUDE, YOU KNOW."
680,00:35:01.42,00:35:01.42,SHE'S ABSOLUTE THE WEAKEST ATTHIS POINT.
681,00:35:04.25,00:35:04.25,TONIGHT WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS--DAVID OR SARITA.
682,00:35:07.46,00:35:07.46,"SARITA VERY LOYAL, VERYTRUSTWORTHY."
683,00:35:10.12,00:35:10.12,"HOWEVER, IN CHALLENGES SHE'S"
684,00:35:12.25,00:35:12.25,VERY FLUSTERED AND NOT VERYSTRONG.
685,00:35:15.42,00:35:15.42,"DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S ATHINKER."
686,00:35:17.75,00:35:17.75,HE'S VERY SMART.
687,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,I THINK HE'LL HELP US GET
688,00:35:20.25,00:35:20.25,THROUGH FUTURE CHALLENGES WITHPUZZLES.
689,00:35:21.75,00:35:21.75,"HOWEVER, HE'S A LITTLE BITHARDER TO TRUST, AND IF WE END"

691,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,DO WE WANT TO HAVE WITH US ATTHE MERGE?
692,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,IT'S A TOTAL CATCH-22 AT THISPOINT.
693,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,EITHER WE HAVE A LOYAL TRIBE OR
694,00:35:33.54,00:35:33.54,WE HAVE A TAD BIT STRONGERTRIBE.
695,00:35:35.75,00:35:35.75,RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A BIT OF ATAILSPIN AND WE HAVE A COUPLE
696,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,THOUSAND FEET BEFORE WE HIT THEDECK AND CRASH AND BURN SO WE
697,00:35:42.12,00:35:42.12,NEED TO FIGURE A WAY OUT OF THISTAILSPIN.

710,00:36:30.08,00:36:30.08,>> THAT'S CORRECT.IT IS BAD KARMA.

712,00:36:36.29,00:36:36.29,THE OTHER TRIBE AND WE THOUGHTWE COULD SPARE TO THROW ONE
713,00:36:39.17,00:36:39.17,CHALLENGE AND WE STILL FEEL LIKE
714,00:36:41.46,00:36:41.46,WE'RE STRONGER THAN THE OTHERTRIBE.
715,00:36:43.46,00:36:43.46,">> Jeff: DAVID, MAYBE THEPROBLEM ISN'T THAT YOU'RE NOT AS"
716,00:36:46.58,00:36:46.58,STRONG AS THE OTHER TRIBE.
717,00:36:48.12,00:36:48.12,MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE JUSTNOT AS COHESIVE.
718,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHATTHE PROBLEM IS.
719,00:36:51.83,00:36:51.83,IT'S A LACK OF UNITY HERE.
720,00:36:53.79,00:36:53.79,WHEN WE WERE BANDED TOGETHERAGAINST RUSSELL THAT WAS
721,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,SOMETHING WE ALL HAD A SIMILARGOAL TOWARDS.
722,00:36:58.54,00:36:58.54,BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER
723,00:37:00.08,00:37:00.08,"TRIBE, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALLFRIENDS."
724,00:37:02.17,00:37:02.17,THEY'RE ALL SITTING THERE
725,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,"LAUGHING, GIGGLING, AND HAVING AGOOD TIME."
726,00:37:05.38,00:37:05.38,IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT'S ACOMPONENT OF THEIR DAILY LIFE.
727,00:37:08.83,00:37:08.83,">> Jeff: RALPH, DOES THAT RINGTRUE TO YOU, HOW IMPORTANT IT IS"
728,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,THAT THE ENTIRE GROUP BECOHESIVE?
729,00:37:13.88,00:37:13.88,">> WELL, FIRST, JEFF, I DON'TKNOW WHAT ""COHESIVE"" MEANS."
730,00:37:18.29,00:37:18.29,">> Jeff: WELL IN YOUR JOB YOUMANAGE A GROUP OF GUYS, RIGHT?"
731,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,>> YES.>> Jeff: WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE

735,00:37:30.54,00:37:30.54,>> I DISAGREE.
736,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,>> Jeff: IT'S A QUESTION.
737,00:37:33.38,00:37:33.38,WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE?
738,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONES THATARE STRONGER BECAUSE IF THEY DO

740,00:37:41.12,00:37:41.12,>> I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.
741,00:37:42.71,00:37:42.71,I THINK ANY COACH WOULD RATHERHAVE A GROUP THAT GETS ALONG.
742,00:37:45.79,00:37:45.79,AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE'REALL WORKING TOGETHER.
743,00:37:48.58,00:37:48.58,">> Jeff: KRISTA WOULDDISAGREE, STEPHANIE WOULD"

747,00:37:59.46,00:37:59.46,THEY WERE THE DISSENTERS AMONGTHE GROUP.
748,00:38:02.25,00:38:02.25,DAVID MAY DISAGREE BUT I KNOWTHAT WE FEEL WE'RE STRONGER.

752,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,>> ABSOLUTELY.
753,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,STEPHANIE'S REFUSAL TO VOTE WITHTHE TRIBE AND INSTEAD VOTING
754,00:38:18.75,00:38:18.75,WITH KRISTA TIPPED THE SCALESAGAINST HER ULTIMATELY.
755,00:38:21.79,00:38:21.79,THE FACT THAT I DID THE SAMETHING AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
756,00:38:24.58,00:38:24.58,CONCERNS ME BUT I GAVE STEPHANIEMY WORD.
757,00:38:27.92,00:38:27.92,AND I'M NOT GONNA JUMP BACKWARDSAT THAT POINT.

761,00:38:40.58,00:38:40.58,JUST BECAUSE I TRUSTED IN THESIX.
762,00:38:42.50,00:38:42.50,>> I TRUSTED IN THE SIX AND I
763,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,DON'T HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL TRUSTIN YOU.
764,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,>> I WAS SURPRISED WHEN DAVIDVOTED FOR ME LAST WEEK.
765,00:38:48.29,00:38:48.29,I THOUGHT THE SIX WAS STRONG ANDNO MATTER WHAT DIFFERENCES WE
766,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,HAD I WOULD NEVER HAVE WRITTEN
