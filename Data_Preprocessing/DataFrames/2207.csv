587,00:30:56.54,00:30:56.54,>> WE WON AGAIN! >> WE WON AGAIN!
588,00:30:58.75,00:30:58.75,">> I FIND IT HARD NOT TO BE TRIBAL IN MY THINKING, COMMUNITY"
589,00:31:02.50,00:31:02.50,"IN MY THINKING, SO RIGHT NOW I'M ON TOP OF THE EARTH."
590,00:31:05.33,00:31:05.33,>> WE GOT TO KEEP THIS GOING.
591,00:31:06.83,00:31:06.83,>> COMEBACK KIDS.
592,00:31:08.54,00:31:08.54,>> THEY ARE GOOD BUT WE ARE BETTER.
593,00:31:10.25,00:31:10.25,>> WHAT'S IN THAT JAR RIGHT THERE?
594,00:31:11.79,00:31:11.79,">> OH, DUDE, TRY IT. THEY'RE SO GOOD."
595,00:31:13.33,00:31:13.33,CHOCOLATE SWIRLED IN WAFER.
596,00:31:15.04,00:31:15.04,">> I'VE BEEN ON ENOUGH REWARDS TO KNOW WHENEVER YOU WIN ONE,"
597,00:31:18.12,00:31:18.12,THERE'S GONNA BE A CLUE.
598,00:31:19.46,00:31:19.46,"SO IMMEDIATELY IT HITS ME, THE COOKIES ARE CYLINDRICAL SHAPED."
599,00:31:23.12,00:31:23.12,THE CLUE'S GOT TO BE IN THERE.
600,00:31:24.54,00:31:24.54,>> THOSE WILL MAKE YOUR HEART STOP.
601,00:31:26.88,00:31:26.88,>> AND SURE ENOUGH IN THE CENTER IS A CLUE
602,00:31:28.67,00:31:28.67,WRAPPED UP LIKE A COOKIE.
603,00:31:30.33,00:31:30.33,>> DO YOU PUT PESTO ON YOUR SANDWICH?
604,00:31:31.83,00:31:31.83,>> NO. YOU HAVE SOME?
605,00:31:33.25,00:31:33.25,">> DUDE, IT'S SO GOOD!"
606,00:31:35.29,00:31:35.29,BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T EVEN MATTER WHAT IT SAYS BECAUSE I
607,00:31:37.71,00:31:37.71,"ALREADY HAVE THE IDOL, SO..."
608,00:31:40.58,00:31:40.58,MIGHT AS WELL JUST THROW IT AWAY IN THE VOLCANO!
609,00:31:43.46,00:31:43.46,BYE-BYE!
610,00:31:54.75,00:31:54.75,>> THAT CERTAINLY SUCKED.
611,00:31:56.54,00:31:56.54,SO TODAY'S CHALLENGE WAS AN AWESOME CHALLENGE.
612,00:31:58.96,00:31:58.96,THE OUTCOME COMPLETELY SUCKED.
613,00:32:00.96,00:32:00.96,"THAT'S THREE LOSSES IN A ROW, ALL THREE FOR FOOD."
614,00:32:03.96,00:32:03.96,WE'RE STARVING OUT HERE.
615,00:32:05.12,00:32:05.12,WE'RE TIRED OF GOING TO TRIBAL.
616,00:32:06.67,00:32:06.67,AFTER TONIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE SIX OF THEM AND FIVE OF US.
617,00:32:10.38,00:32:10.38,NOT A GOOD SITUATION WITH A LOOMING MERGE.
618,00:32:21.88,00:32:21.88,>> SO WHAT DO WE THINK?
619,00:32:23.29,00:32:23.29,THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME
620,00:32:24.29,00:32:24.29,WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO TALK.
621,00:32:25.92,00:32:25.92,>> I WAS THINKING DAVE.
622,00:32:27.79,00:32:27.79,>> ARE YOU GUYS FEELING GOOD ABOUT LOSING THE PUZZLE MAKER?
623,00:32:30.25,00:32:30.25,I WANT THE TRIBE TO WIN.
624,00:32:33.04,00:32:33.04,>> MICHAEL CAN MORE THAN FILL HIS SHOES ON THE PUZZLES.
625,00:32:36.33,00:32:36.33,>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM DO ANYTHING TOO OUTSTANDING AT ANY
626,00:32:40.25,00:32:40.25,OF THE CHALLENGES.
627,00:32:41.62,00:32:41.62,>> I FEEL LIKE I CAN DO ANYTHING DAVE CAN DO AND I FEEL LIKE--
628,00:32:44.75,00:32:44.75,BECAUSE I WOULD SAY KICK ME OFF
629,00:32:47.17,00:32:47.17,IF I FELT LIKE DAVE WAS BETTER THAN ME.
630,00:32:49.08,00:32:49.08,I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE HE IS.
631,00:32:50.75,00:32:50.75,I-- I DON'T THINK HE'S GOOD.
632,00:32:53.46,00:32:53.46,TONIGHT IN TRIBAL COUNCIL I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR DAVID BECAUSE
633,00:32:56.67,00:32:56.67,"HE'S A LOOSE CANNON, AND KNOWING THAT HE VOTED FOR ME LAST TIME,"
634,00:33:01.58,00:33:01.58,"KNOWING THAT HE DOESN'T TRUST ME AT ALL, IT DOESN'T REALLY BODE"
635,00:33:06.25,00:33:06.25,WELL FOR THE FUTURE.
636,00:33:07.21,00:33:07.21,>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
637,00:33:08.71,00:33:08.71,>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON THE PROGRAM.
638,00:33:10.12,00:33:10.12,I TALKED TO THE OTHER FOUR.
639,00:33:12.08,00:33:12.08,>> YOU HAVE? >> YEAH.
640,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17,>> THEY WANT TO GET DAVE?
641,00:33:18.21,00:33:18.21,>> IT'S BESIDE THE POINT.
642,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,I DON'T TRUST DAVE NOT TO GET TOGETHER WITH THEM BEFORE THE
643,00:33:22.25,00:33:22.25,END OF THE DAY AND GET ONE OF US OFF.
644,00:33:24.08,00:33:24.08,I REALLY DON'T.
645,00:33:25.17,00:33:25.17,I DON'T TRUST DAVE AT ALL.
646,00:33:26.88,00:33:26.88,">> NO, I DON'T EITHER."
647,00:33:28.25,00:33:28.25,>> BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THIS NEXT ONE IS DAVE.
648,00:33:31.12,00:33:31.12,>> YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
649,00:33:33.62,00:33:33.62,>> I FEEL LIKE DAVID IS GOING TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD CHANCE OF
650,00:33:36.29,00:33:36.29,"BEATING BOY WONDER ON REDEMPTION ISLAND, WHICH I DON'T WANT TO"
651,00:33:40.12,00:33:40.12,SEE HIM COME BACK.
652,00:33:41.54,00:33:41.54,"HE'S GOING TO COME BACK LIKE A HELL ON WHEELS FOR ME, BUT..."
653,00:33:46.21,00:33:46.21,THE GAME IS THE GAME.
654,00:33:49.46,00:33:49.46,>> I FEEL A LITTLE BIT MORE NERVOUS TONIGHT THAN I HAVE IN
655,00:33:52.17,00:33:52.17,"THE PAST, PRIMARILY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT THE TRIBE HAS"
656,00:33:55.21,00:33:55.21,SEEN THE LIGHT IN TERMS OF KEEPING STRENGTH.
657,00:33:58.08,00:33:58.08,"LAST TIME, NOBODY WAS INTERESTED IN FOCUSING ON STRENGTH OF THE"
658,00:34:01.17,00:34:01.17,"TRIBE, AND THEY WANTED TO FOCUS ON TRUST."
659,00:34:03.29,00:34:03.29,"IF THAT HAPPENS AGAIN, THERE'S A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY I AM THE"
660,00:34:06.46,00:34:06.46,ONE GOING HOME.
661,00:34:07.96,00:34:07.96,>> HERE COMES DAVE.
662,00:34:09.17,00:34:09.17,GOOD WORK!
663,00:34:12.12,00:34:12.12,>> I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM PICK UP THAT BIG A PIECE OF LUMBER
664,00:34:16.17,00:34:16.17,SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE.
665,00:34:17.29,00:34:17.29,">> YEAH, EXACTLY."
666,00:34:18.67,00:34:18.67,>> WE WERE GOING TO TARGET DAVID.
667,00:34:20.58,00:34:20.58,BUT SARITA STRUGGLED TODAY.
668,00:34:22.83,00:34:22.83,"SHE FUMBLED A COUPLE OF TIMES, COULDN'T GET THE BAG OPEN,"
669,00:34:25.38,00:34:25.38,SHE STARTED PANICKING.
670,00:34:27.17,00:34:27.17,IT JUST WASN'T COMING TOGETHER FOR HER.
671,00:34:28.38,00:34:28.38,"DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND, REALLY CAME THROUGH FOR US."
672,00:34:37.50,00:34:37.50,">> FOR THE STRENGTH OF THE TRIBE IN CHALLENGES, WE THINK WE'VE"
673,00:34:40.67,00:34:40.67,GOT TO KEEP DAVE.
674,00:34:41.96,00:34:41.96,>> REALLY?
675,00:34:44.21,00:34:44.21,">> IN MY EYES, YOU KNOW, I DON'T TRUST DAVID."
676,00:34:47.42,00:34:47.42,>> I DON'T TRUST HIM AT ALL.
677,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,">> I LOVE SARITA, I THINK SHE'S GREAT BUT SHE'S"
678,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,"BEEN SUPER, SUPER WEAK AT EVERY CHALLENGE."
679,00:34:54.29,00:34:54.29,SHE TENDS TO GET FLUSTERED AND FREAKED OUT A LITTLE BIT.
680,00:34:57.67,00:34:57.67,"SHE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT INTESTINAL FORTITUDE, YOU KNOW."
681,00:35:01.42,00:35:01.42,SHE'S ABSOLUTE THE WEAKEST AT THIS POINT.
682,00:35:04.25,00:35:04.25,TONIGHT WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS-- DAVID OR SARITA.
683,00:35:07.46,00:35:07.46,"SARITA VERY LOYAL, VERY TRUSTWORTHY."
684,00:35:10.12,00:35:10.12,"HOWEVER, IN CHALLENGES SHE'S"
685,00:35:12.25,00:35:12.25,VERY FLUSTERED AND NOT VERY STRONG.
686,00:35:15.42,00:35:15.42,"DAVID, ON THE OTHER HAND, HE'S A THINKER."
687,00:35:17.75,00:35:17.75,HE'S VERY SMART.
688,00:35:19.21,00:35:19.21,I THINK HE'LL HELP US GET
689,00:35:20.25,00:35:20.25,THROUGH FUTURE CHALLENGES WITH PUZZLES.
690,00:35:21.75,00:35:21.75,"HOWEVER, HE'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO TRUST, AND IF WE END"
691,00:35:25.12,00:35:25.12,"UP MERGING SOME TIME SOON, WHO"
692,00:35:27.08,00:35:27.08,DO WE WANT TO HAVE WITH US AT THE MERGE?
693,00:35:29.83,00:35:29.83,IT'S A TOTAL CATCH-22 AT THIS POINT.
694,00:35:31.67,00:35:31.67,EITHER WE HAVE A LOYAL TRIBE OR
695,00:35:33.54,00:35:33.54,WE HAVE A TAD BIT STRONGER TRIBE.
696,00:35:35.75,00:35:35.75,RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A BIT OF A TAILSPIN AND WE HAVE A COUPLE
697,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,THOUSAND FEET BEFORE WE HIT THE DECK AND CRASH AND BURN SO WE
698,00:35:42.12,00:35:42.12,NEED TO FIGURE A WAY OUT OF THIS TAILSPIN.
699,00:35:59.75,00:35:59.75,">> Jeff: ALL RIGHT, RALPH, YOU"
700,00:36:01.08,00:36:01.08,TELL ME-- WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ZAPATERA?
701,00:36:04.46,00:36:04.46,">> JEFF, IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TODAY."
702,00:36:07.29,00:36:07.29,"WE WAS AHEAD, BUT WHEN IT GOT TO THE BALLS..."
703,00:36:09.62,00:36:09.62,>> CAN I PIPE IN?
704,00:36:11.21,00:36:11.21,>> YES.
705,00:36:12.75,00:36:12.75,">> Jeff: DAVID, FINISH THIS SENTENCE, ""EXCUSES ARE FOR...""?"
706,00:36:15.83,00:36:15.83,>> LOSERS.
707,00:36:18.12,00:36:18.12,>> I'M A LOSER THEN.
708,00:36:20.62,00:36:20.62,">> Jeff: JULIE, THERE IS ONE GLARING STAT."
709,00:36:23.92,00:36:23.92,SINCE YOU THREW THE CHALLENGE TO GET RID OF RUSSELL YOU HAVE LOST
710,00:36:28.08,00:36:28.08,THE NEXT THREE OF FOUR CHALLENGES.
711,00:36:30.08,00:36:30.08,>> THAT'S CORRECT. IT IS BAD KARMA.
712,00:36:32.42,00:36:32.42,"AT THE TIME, JEFF, WE THOUGHT OUR TRIBE WAS WAY STRONGER THAN"
713,00:36:36.29,00:36:36.29,THE OTHER TRIBE AND WE THOUGHT WE COULD SPARE TO THROW ONE
714,00:36:39.17,00:36:39.17,CHALLENGE AND WE STILL FEEL LIKE
715,00:36:41.46,00:36:41.46,WE'RE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER TRIBE.
716,00:36:43.46,00:36:43.46,">> Jeff: DAVID, MAYBE THE PROBLEM ISN'T THAT YOU'RE NOT AS"
717,00:36:46.58,00:36:46.58,STRONG AS THE OTHER TRIBE.
718,00:36:48.12,00:36:48.12,MAYBE THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE JUST NOT AS COHESIVE.
719,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,>> I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.
720,00:36:51.83,00:36:51.83,IT'S A LACK OF UNITY HERE.
721,00:36:53.79,00:36:53.79,WHEN WE WERE BANDED TOGETHER AGAINST RUSSELL THAT WAS
722,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,SOMETHING WE ALL HAD A SIMILAR GOAL TOWARDS.
723,00:36:58.54,00:36:58.54,BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER
724,00:37:00.08,00:37:00.08,"TRIBE, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ALL FRIENDS."
725,00:37:02.17,00:37:02.17,THEY'RE ALL SITTING THERE
726,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,"LAUGHING, GIGGLING, AND HAVING A GOOD TIME."
727,00:37:05.38,00:37:05.38,IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT'S A COMPONENT OF THEIR DAILY LIFE.
728,00:37:08.83,00:37:08.83,">> Jeff: RALPH, DOES THAT RING TRUE TO YOU, HOW IMPORTANT IT IS"
729,00:37:11.33,00:37:11.33,THAT THE ENTIRE GROUP BE COHESIVE?
730,00:37:13.88,00:37:13.88,">> WELL, FIRST, JEFF, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ""COHESIVE"" MEANS."
731,00:37:18.29,00:37:18.29,">> Jeff: WELL IN YOUR JOB YOU MANAGE A GROUP OF GUYS, RIGHT?"
732,00:37:21.25,00:37:21.25,>> YES. >> Jeff: WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
733,00:37:22.62,00:37:22.62,A DOZEN GUYS WHO ARE REALLY STRONG BUT DIDN'T GET ALONG VERY
734,00:37:25.42,00:37:25.42,WELL OR A DOZEN GUYS THAT MAYBE AREN'T THAT STRONG BUT WORK
735,00:37:29.17,00:37:29.17,WELL AS A UNIT.
736,00:37:30.54,00:37:30.54,>> I DISAGREE.
737,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,>> Jeff: IT'S A QUESTION.
738,00:37:33.38,00:37:33.38,WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE?
739,00:37:35.00,00:37:35.00,>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONES THAT ARE STRONGER BECAUSE IF THEY DO
740,00:37:37.50,00:37:37.50,"GET ALONG, YAK, YAK, YAK, YAK."
741,00:37:41.12,00:37:41.12,>> I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE.
742,00:37:42.71,00:37:42.71,I THINK ANY COACH WOULD RATHER HAVE A GROUP THAT GETS ALONG.
743,00:37:45.79,00:37:45.79,AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.
744,00:37:48.58,00:37:48.58,">> Jeff: KRISTA WOULD DISAGREE, STEPHANIE WOULD"
745,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,"DISAGREE, AND FROM WHAT I SEE RECENTLY BETWEEN DAVID AND"
746,00:37:54.21,00:37:54.21,"SARITA, DAVID WOULD PROBABLY DISAGREE."
747,00:37:56.79,00:37:56.79,>> THAT'S WHY KRISTA AND STEPHANIE ARE GONE.
748,00:37:59.46,00:37:59.46,THEY WERE THE DISSENTERS AMONG THE GROUP.
749,00:38:02.25,00:38:02.25,DAVID MAY DISAGREE BUT I KNOW THAT WE FEEL WE'RE STRONGER.
750,00:38:06.38,00:38:06.38,">> Jeff: DAVID, YOU HAVE BEEN PRETTY VOCAL IN YOUR SUPPORT OF"
751,00:38:09.50,00:38:09.50,KRISTA AND STEPHANIE.
752,00:38:11.25,00:38:11.25,ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT MAY NOW PUT THE TARGET ON YOU?
753,00:38:13.83,00:38:13.83,>> ABSOLUTELY.
754,00:38:15.17,00:38:15.17,STEPHANIE'S REFUSAL TO VOTE WITH THE TRIBE AND INSTEAD VOTING
755,00:38:18.75,00:38:18.75,WITH KRISTA TIPPED THE SCALES AGAINST HER ULTIMATELY.
756,00:38:21.79,00:38:21.79,THE FACT THAT I DID THE SAME THING AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL
757,00:38:24.58,00:38:24.58,CONCERNS ME BUT I GAVE STEPHANIE MY WORD.
758,00:38:27.92,00:38:27.92,AND I'M NOT GONNA JUMP BACKWARDS AT THAT POINT.
759,00:38:31.00,00:38:31.00,">> Jeff: SARITA, DAVID MAKES THE ARGUMENT BY KEEPING HIS WORD"
760,00:38:35.21,00:38:35.21,HE IS ACTUALLY SHOWING HE'S LOYAL.
761,00:38:37.54,00:38:37.54,>> THAT DOESN'T REALLY FLY WITH ME
762,00:38:40.58,00:38:40.58,JUST BECAUSE I TRUSTED IN THE SIX.
763,00:38:42.50,00:38:42.50,>> I TRUSTED IN THE SIX AND I
764,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,DON'T HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL TRUST IN YOU.
765,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,>> I WAS SURPRISED WHEN DAVID VOTED FOR ME LAST WEEK.
766,00:38:48.29,00:38:48.29,I THOUGHT THE SIX WAS STRONG AND NO MATTER WHAT DIFFERENCES WE
767,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,HAD I WOULD NEVER HAVE WRITTEN
768,00:38:52.58,00:38:52.58,HIS NAME DOWN BECAUSE I DO HONOR MY ALLIANCES.
769,00:38:54.75,00:38:54.75,BUT THEN HE YELLED AT ME A COUPLE OF TIMES
770,00:38:56.92,00:38:56.92,AND GOT ME IN MY FACE AND THAT'S NOT A PERSON I CAN TRUST.
771,00:38:59.88,00:38:59.88,"IT DOESN'T MEAN THE SIX CHANGE, IT MEANT THAT I WASN'T"
772,00:39:02.83,00:39:02.83,GONNA BE THICK AS THIEVES WITH DAVID.
773,00:39:04.54,00:39:04.54,>> CARRY ON AFTER THE SIX SO THERE WAS BASICALLY NO ALLIANCE
774,00:39:07.08,00:39:07.08,BETWEEN THE TWO OF US BUT SHE WAS STILL WILLING TO WORK WITH
