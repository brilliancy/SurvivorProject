4,00:00:08.00,00:00:08.00,...winning all three immunity challenges.
5,00:00:11.04,00:00:11.04,"At camp, most of the tribe kicked back and relaxed, while"
6,00:00:14.92,00:00:14.92,Shambo did most of the work. >> I'm not doing the warm and
7,00:00:17.46,00:00:17.46,fuzzy. I'm doing the Rambo-Shambo
8,00:00:19.50,00:00:19.50,"provider role out here. >> PROBST: In a twist, Shambo"
9,00:00:21.54,00:00:21.54,was sent to observe the other tribe.
10,00:00:23.83,00:00:23.83,>> We call you McDreamy. >> Pleasure.
11,00:00:25.83,00:00:25.83,>> PROBST: And she immediately bonded with everyone.
12,00:00:29.00,00:00:29.00,"At Foa Foa, Russell was a force to be reckoned with."
13,00:00:32.38,00:00:32.38,>> I'm running this whole show right now.
14,00:00:34.62,00:00:34.62,>> PROBST: He constantly manipulated the others to
15,00:00:37.00,00:00:37.00,further his own ends. >> I'm going to have them all
16,00:00:39.04,00:00:39.04,under control like zombies walking around.
17,00:00:41.04,00:00:41.04,>> PROBST: As the yellow tribe was preparing to go to their
18,00:00:43.38,00:00:43.38,third Tribal Council in a row... >> He was...
19,00:00:45.38,00:00:45.38,">> If I was a girl, I would slap you, is what I would do."
20,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,>> PROBST: ...Jaison got furious at Ben because of his
21,00:00:50.21,00:00:50.21,racially-insensitive comments. >> PROBST: Jaison wanted Ben
22,00:00:56.92,00:00:56.92,"out, but Russell didn't agree. >> Right now, I think I need"
23,00:00:59.25,00:00:59.25,Ben. >> PROBST: At Tribal Cou
24,00:01:01.33,00:01:01.33,"Ben wouldn't back down. >> She is from the ghetto, and"
25,00:01:03.71,00:01:03.71,she's trashy. That's ghetto trash.
26,00:01:05.62,00:01:05.62,That's not racial. >> PROBST: So Jaison stood up to
27,00:01:07.62,00:01:07.62,him. >> If what you're telling me is
28,00:01:10.12,00:01:10.12,"that what you said had absolutely no racial context,"
29,00:01:13.00,00:01:13.00,then maybe you are ignorant. >> PROBST: During the
30,00:01:15.04,00:01:15.04,"confrontation, Russell realized his best play was to vote off"
31,00:01:17.79,00:01:17.79,Ben. >> I didn't want to have to do
32,00:01:20.25,00:01:20.25,"this, man. >> PROBST: Ben became the fourth"
33,00:01:22.38,00:01:22.38,member of Foa Foa to leave the game.
34,00:01:24.46,00:01:24.46,Now the tribe is down in numbers and morale.
35,00:01:27.75,00:01:27.75,16 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
36,00:01:47.12,00:01:47.12,>> Yeah. >> What happened at Tribal
37,00:01:49.12,00:01:49.12,Council was me trying to let Ben know how I felt.
38,00:01:52.04,00:01:52.04,I cannot handle people who use terms and phrases that are meant
39,00:01:56.25,00:01:56.25,"to hurt on a very basic level. >> Jaison, there's room here,"
40,00:02:02.71,00:02:02.71,too. >> Man!
41,00:02:04.71,00:02:04.71,"I'm hungry, and I'm tired. I came here to have an"
42,00:02:07.42,00:02:07.42,"adventure, but, frankly, I, right now, believe that coming"
43,00:02:11.42,00:02:11.42,here was the worst decision I've made in my entire life.
44,00:02:26.33,00:02:26.33,">> It's draining, man. It's not only physically tough."
45,00:02:29.17,00:02:29.17,"It's mentally tough. It messes with your mind, your"
46,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,body and your soul. Coming back from Tribal last
47,00:02:35.17,00:02:35.17,"night, Jaison was really upset with Ben."
48,00:02:38.33,00:02:38.33,"You know, he took things very personal."
49,00:02:41.25,00:02:41.25,"I really think that if Ben would have stayed, Jaison would have"
50,00:02:44.38,00:02:44.38,"quit the game. Now, what kind of man is that?"
51,00:02:51.04,00:02:51.04,">> Yeah, dude. >> Yeah?"
52,00:02:57.29,00:02:57.29,">> Now I'm willing to get rid of Jaison, and whoever I want to be"
53,00:03:01.12,00:03:01.12,gone is going to be gone. I've got it all under my thumb
54,00:03:05.12,00:03:05.12,right now. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
55,00:04:23.21,00:04:23.21,">> I got back at Galu last night, and I'm not happy,"
56,00:04:26.29,00:04:26.29,"because when I went over to Foa Foa, there was a huge"
57,00:04:30.50,00:04:30.50,"appreciation for Shambo, huge appreciation."
58,00:04:33.58,00:04:33.58,"Their camp is amazing, you guys. Fresh water, white sand beaches."
59,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,"No coral, you can go barefoot. Everybody over there loved me."
60,00:04:41.75,00:04:41.75,"I feel ten times closer to Foa Foa than I do Galu, because"
61,00:04:45.12,00:04:45.12,Galu-- they just want to lay on the beach and gossip.
62,00:04:49.92,00:04:49.92,"So, I don't have no problem going to Foa Foa, because I"
63,00:04:52.92,00:04:52.92,"already have a following there, and if I can make it to the"
64,00:04:56.17,00:04:56.17,"merge, I know damn well I've got their vote, so I'm way ahead."
65,00:05:08.58,00:05:08.58,>> Yas got a clue for the immunity idol.
66,00:05:10.58,00:05:10.58,>> Okay. >> You got a clue for the
67,00:05:12.58,00:05:12.58,immunity idol. >> Absolutely.
68,00:05:14.58,00:05:14.58,">> Wherever the immunity idol is on their beach, it's"
69,00:05:16.58,00:05:16.58,probably on our beach. Nobody really got to talk to
70,00:05:18.67,00:05:18.67,Shambo last night about the second clue to the immunity
71,00:05:20.88,00:05:20.88,"idol, right? So I come up with this little"
72,00:05:24.00,00:05:24.00,idea to find out all the information I want to get from
73,00:05:26.00,00:05:26.00,her. (Shambo sighs)
74,00:05:28.04,00:05:28.04,"If I can find the immunity idol, I can give it to you if"
75,00:05:30.46,00:05:30.46,you're in danger. >> Yup.
76,00:05:32.46,00:05:32.46,">> At least you'll have that. I'm, like, 30 seconds away from"
77,00:05:36.17,00:05:36.17,"nailing all the information I want to get from her, and here"
78,00:05:38.50,00:05:38.50,"comes John, and he stops, and, like, ""Hey, Shambo."""
79,00:05:41.54,00:05:41.54,"Like he has this brilliant idea. >> You got a clue, and Yasmin"
80,00:05:44.21,00:05:44.21,had a clue. >> I got her clue and my clue.
81,00:05:46.58,00:05:46.58,">> What was Yasmin's clue? >> Yasmin's clue was, ""You'll"
82,00:05:50.67,00:05:50.67,"find what you seek in the bark."" And the second one is, ""It's"
83,00:05:55.12,00:05:55.12,"low to the ground."" Those were the exact words."
84,00:05:57.62,00:05:57.62,"If it comes down to jury trial, you guys better give me the"
85,00:06:00.12,00:06:00.12,vote for giving you honesty on this question.
86,00:06:02.25,00:06:02.25,">> Well, listen, if um... If we can..."
87,00:06:04.17,00:06:04.17,">> And if you don't, bad on you. Got to go."
88,00:06:07.25,00:06:07.25,"I don't feel like I've hurt myself in the game in any way,"
89,00:06:09.67,00:06:09.67,"shape, or form by sharing knowledge with them."
90,00:06:12.04,00:06:12.04,That can do nothing but help me going forward.
91,00:06:15.25,00:06:15.25,"And-And maybe it won't. Maybe it will hurt me, but"
92,00:06:17.92,00:06:17.92,we'll see. >> Tree mail.
93,00:06:22.58,00:06:22.58,">> Uh-oh. >> And it says, ""The chief must"
94,00:06:25.04,00:06:25.04,choose two to join him on a quest to go on a special mission
95,00:06:27.88,00:06:27.88,which could turn out for the best.
96,00:06:30.25,00:06:30.25,"And when your chief comes home..."""
97,00:06:32.25,00:06:32.25,">> Oh! >> ""...your tribe might have"
98,00:06:34.12,00:06:34.12,"more to eat..."" >> Oh!"
99,00:06:36.17,00:06:36.17,">> ""...but you won't know why until the mission is complete."""
100,00:06:39.04,00:06:39.04,">> Basically, they just want one guy, one girl."
101,00:06:41.25,00:06:41.25,"We just got some tree mail, and it says that I need to choose"
102,00:06:43.54,00:06:43.54,"two people to go on a mission, which may or may not lead to us"
103,00:06:46.54,00:06:46.54,"having a little bit more food. Obviously, you want to bring"
104,00:06:49.46,00:06:49.46,people that are strong in some sort of challenge situation.
105,00:06:52.79,00:06:52.79,"So I'll be taking Russell, because he is good at"
106,00:06:56.21,00:06:56.21,"strategizing, and Natalie is good with puzzles, things of"
107,00:06:58.25,00:06:58.25,that nature. So I thought it was perfect.
108,00:07:00.33,00:07:00.33,Everybody's comfortable with this?
109,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,">> That's fine, yup. >> Yup, yup."
110,00:07:04.42,00:07:04.42,>> Let's do this. >> Have to choose two people to
111,00:07:13.25,00:07:13.25,"go on a quest with me, so I took Shambo and Dave because I need"
112,00:07:17.54,00:07:17.54,some-some brains and some firepower.
113,00:07:22.29,00:07:22.29,Here comes Foa Foa. >> So we're just sitting there
114,00:07:39.58,00:07:39.58,"looking at each other. You know, we're waiting for"
115,00:07:42.42,00:07:42.42,"Jeff, 'cause at every challenge so far, Jeff has always been"
116,00:07:45.29,00:07:45.29,"there. So we're, like, what do we do?"
117,00:07:49.58,00:07:49.58,>> So what's going on? >> I don't know.
118,00:07:51.92,00:07:51.92,>> Let's lay an egg. (indistinct chatter)
119,00:07:54.04,00:07:54.04,">> Oh, my word. >> Oh, chickens."
120,00:07:56.75,00:07:56.75,">> Oh, my God. >> Who knows what's in the"
121,00:07:58.79,00:07:58.79,other one. >> Nah. It's probably rice and
122,00:08:01.12,00:08:01.12,"beans. >> Oh, if you catch the chicken,"
123,00:08:04.00,00:08:04.00,you get the pirate chest full of food.
124,00:08:06.08,00:08:06.08,"Ha, ha. >> Maybe so."
125,00:08:08.08,00:08:08.08,>> I don't think that's what it is.
126,00:08:10.42,00:08:10.42,">> Some kind of swap? >> I think so, too."
127,00:08:12.42,00:08:12.42,">> I wonder if we're just supposed to jump, like just get"
128,00:08:15.71,00:08:15.71,over there and start doing stuff without even asking.
129,00:08:20.21,00:08:20.21,(clucking) >> Wait.
130,00:08:34.67,00:08:34.67,">> A reward challenge. ""For today's challenge, you'll"
131,00:08:36.75,00:08:36.75,"be left on your own to battle for reward inside this box... """
132,00:08:39.08,00:08:39.08,"Suddenly, it was on. The frenzy was on."
133,00:08:41.29,00:08:41.29,"Shambo's grabbing chickens, we're jumping into the treasure"
134,00:08:43.96,00:08:43.96,"box, and it's got all these colored balls, and it's got some"
135,00:08:46.50,00:08:46.50,"instructions. >> Oh, all right, Sham, the"
136,00:08:49.21,00:08:49.21,reward cannot be opened and-and shared between tribes...
137,00:08:51.25,00:08:51.25,"Sham, put those chickens back and come on back."
138,00:08:53.29,00:08:53.29,">> Hey, put the chicken back, quick."
139,00:08:55.38,00:08:55.38,>> Take 'em back. Take' em back. Take them chickens back.
140,00:08:58.88,00:08:58.88,">> Okay, so what is the deal? >> Uh... ""For today's challenge,"
141,00:09:02.08,00:09:02.08,you will be left on your own to battle for reward.
142,00:09:04.04,00:09:04.04,Inside this box are a flag and three tribe-colored balls for
143,00:09:06.46,00:09:06.46,each player. One player will place the flag
144,00:09:08.46,00:09:08.46,"in the center of the beach. One at a time, you will toss a"
145,00:09:11.00,00:09:11.00,ball toward the flag. The object is to land your ball
146,00:09:13.38,00:09:13.38,closest to the flag. Once all the balls have been
147,00:09:16.21,00:09:16.21,"thrown, the ball closest to the flag wins."""
148,00:09:18.46,00:09:18.46,>> Boccie ball. >> It's like boccie ball.
149,00:09:20.46,00:09:20.46,">> It's boccie ball, horseshoes. >> All right."
150,00:09:22.92,00:09:22.92,"Oh, reward challenge. Awesome!"
151,00:09:24.92,00:09:24.92,It's basically like a game of boccie ball.
152,00:09:26.88,00:09:26.88,The tribe that wins gets to take these chickens home.
153,00:09:28.46,00:09:28.46,">> So, we'll start with the chiefs, so you start first."
154,00:09:30.04,00:09:30.04,>> All right. >> Yeah.
155,00:09:32.00,00:09:32.00,">> Then I'll start. >> Chiefs first, ladies"
156,00:09:33.71,00:09:33.71,second... >> Chiefs first.
157,00:09:35.71,00:09:35.71,">> And the esteemed gentleman... >> Yeah, that's fine."
158,00:09:37.71,00:09:37.71,">> All right, cheers. >> All right."
159,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,">> All right, let's do this. >> All right."
160,00:09:41.42,00:09:41.42,">> Let's go, Mick. Oh, good shot, Mick."
161,00:09:45.04,00:09:45.04,">> Good job, Mick. Good job. You got this one, chief."
162,00:09:48.83,00:09:48.83,">> That was a good one, too. Ah!"
163,00:09:54.17,00:09:54.17,>> Mm. >> So close.
164,00:09:56.17,00:09:56.17,>> Wow. >> Yes!
165,00:09:58.75,00:09:58.75,">> Oh, son of a... >> Yes!"
166,00:10:00.54,00:10:00.54,">> Oh, God. >> Russell's ball knocks mine"
167,00:10:03.75,00:10:03.75,"closest, and I can taste the chicken in my mouth."
168,00:10:08.62,00:10:08.62,">> Wow. >> Good shot, Mick."
169,00:10:12.12,00:10:12.12,>> Oh! >> Oh!
170,00:10:14.21,00:10:14.21,>> Stay out of his way now. Make sure you don't hit it.
171,00:10:16.96,00:10:16.96,>> Mick had thrown those last two balls so close to the stick.
172,00:10:20.67,00:10:20.67,"My goal was to, like, not even get close to him, because I"
173,00:10:23.88,00:10:23.88,"didn't want to mess anything up. Oh, no."
174,00:10:26.88,00:10:26.88,"Sorry, guys. >> Nice."
175,00:10:28.88,00:10:28.88,">> Aah! >> All right, you're up."
176,00:10:30.88,00:10:30.88,>> I'm going to knock him out of there.
177,00:10:33.08,00:10:33.08,>> Get one in. >> Mm.
178,00:10:35.25,00:10:35.25,>> Oop. Too strong. >> Aim right for that stick.
179,00:10:44.71,00:10:44.71,">> Oh, my God, I'm a mess. >> Try knocking his out."
180,00:10:47.71,00:10:47.71,>> That's what I'm going for. >> Oh!
181,00:10:49.71,00:10:49.71,>> Oh! >> Oh!
182,00:10:51.71,00:10:51.71,>> There we go. >> Nice!
183,00:10:53.29,00:10:53.29,>> Nice hit. (grunting)
184,00:10:55.29,00:10:55.29,">> Oh, Shannon Lee. Lord have mercy."
185,00:10:58.79,00:10:58.79,>> We're panicking all over the place.
186,00:11:01.42,00:11:01.42,"Shambo was, like, no good. >> Dang!"
187,00:11:03.54,00:11:03.54,>> So now it's between Russell from Foa Foa and Dave.

189,00:11:10.38,00:11:10.38,">> All right, Russell, we need you."
190,00:11:18.12,00:11:18.12,">> Good job, Russell. >> All right, you're up, Dave."
191,00:11:23.96,00:11:23.96,"Not bad, not bad. >> Ooh..."
192,00:11:30.42,00:11:30.42,>> Gosh. >> Ooh.
193,00:11:34.42,00:11:34.42,">> Yes, that puts two in the way."
194,00:11:36.83,00:11:36.83,">> All right, Russell, nice and easy."
195,00:11:38.62,00:11:38.62,">> Don't knock anything out. You got it, man, you got it."
196,00:11:44.88,00:11:44.88,>> Ooh... >> Dear God.
197,00:11:46.50,00:11:46.50,">> Nice shooting, Tex. >> That might get it done, so"
198,00:11:48.50,00:11:48.50,you're gonna have to get at the stick.
199,00:11:50.50,00:11:50.50,>> Just drop it on it. >> All right.
200,00:11:53.50,00:11:53.50,">> So, Dave's got his final ball."
201,00:11:55.58,00:11:55.58,We've got the closest ball to the flag.
202,00:11:57.38,00:11:57.38,I'm looking over at the chickens like I'm stoked.
203,00:11:59.62,00:11:59.62,This is finally gonna be something we can bring back.
204,00:12:01.79,00:12:01.79,"We're finally gonna win. >> Come on, Dave, you can do it."
205,00:12:03.88,00:12:03.88,">> All right, so this one wins, Dave."
206,00:12:05.46,00:12:05.46,>> Shh. The last ball-- it is on me.
207,00:12:10.75,00:12:10.75,"Make it or break it. 'Cause at this point, we are not"
208,00:12:13.17,00:12:13.17,"going home with the chickens. >> Oh, no."
209,00:12:29.04,00:12:29.04,"(several shouting) >> Oh, my God!"
210,00:12:33.17,00:12:33.17,>> Yes! >> Yes!
211,00:12:35.08,00:12:35.08,(both grunt) Good game.
212,00:12:37.42,00:12:37.42,">> Good game, guys. >> Oh, my God."
213,00:12:39.33,00:12:39.33,">> Good shot. >> Thank you, man."
214,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,"Thank you very much. >> Oh, man."
215,00:12:43.12,00:12:43.12,It's so demoralizing. I'm just so tired of losing to
216,00:12:46.12,00:12:46.12,these guys. It totally split me in half to
217,00:12:49.17,00:12:49.17,see Galu walk off with those chickens.
218,00:12:51.54,00:12:51.54,It's so ludicrous that we can't even pull off frickin' boccie

229,00:15:05.62,00:15:05.62,"gonna use it down the road. Maybe around day 30, 36."
230,00:15:09.25,00:15:09.25,"'Cause I plan on being here for a while, and this is gonna be my"

236,00:15:25.75,00:15:25.75,great coming home. Every time it scraped against
237,00:15:28.54,00:15:28.54,"the back of my ankles, I thought, ""That's okay, we're"

268,00:17:28.08,00:17:28.08,they lost the challenge. I think normally I'd say I was

270,00:17:33.71,00:17:33.71,I'm tired. I'm hungry. You know? I'm really thirsty.
271,00:17:36.83,00:17:36.83,"So for me right now, it doesn't really matter."

273,00:17:53.04,00:17:53.04,I told Jaison I'd bring him to the top two.

275,00:17:59.21,00:17:59.21,game. I need somebody to be able to
276,00:18:01.33,00:18:01.33,help me to the final two. So I would have to take somebody
277,00:18:04.58,00:18:04.58,like Natalie with me. Because she's gonna ride my
278,00:18:07.46,00:18:07.46,"coattails the whole way. I mean, she's too stupid to do"
279,00:18:10.12,00:18:10.12,it by herself. She needs me.
280,00:18:12.33,00:18:12.33,"So I could stand up there and say, ""She followed my coattails"
281,00:18:15.29,00:18:15.29,"this whole way. She rode me like a horse."""

285,00:18:36.04,00:18:36.04,"upset and you're probably gonna cry, 'cause your friends are"
286,00:18:38.21,00:18:38.21,gonna get their hearts broken and you're gonna be one of the
287,00:18:40.71,00:18:40.71,ones doing it to 'em. >> Russell and I have talked

290,00:18:49.04,00:18:49.04,could say. >> You're good... you're good
291,00:18:52.21,00:18:52.21,for a long while. >> I definitely think people
292,00:18:57.17,00:18:57.17,"underestimate me, and I want them to think that, hey, it's"
293,00:19:00.29,00:19:00.29,really smart for them to take me to the end because they can beat
294,00:19:02.83,00:19:02.83,"me. You know, use that to my"
295,00:19:04.58,00:19:04.58,advantage. And if it comes down to me or

297,00:19:10.50,00:19:10.50,I would say a lot of other people in the tribe have really
298,00:19:13.71,00:19:13.71,been rubbed the wrong way by him.

328,00:21:38.25,00:21:38.25,>> Shambo was feeding it. >> Bingo.

332,00:21:53.38,00:21:53.38,get the chicken out of the tree by clucking at it.

335,00:22:01.12,00:22:01.12,The chicken laid an egg. What did you do to produce the
336,00:22:03.12,00:22:03.12,"egg, Shambo? And nobody cares."
337,00:22:06.29,00:22:06.29,That's the worst part. Is anybody looking for the damn
338,00:22:08.79,00:22:08.79,chicken? No. That's just great.

340,00:22:51.08,00:22:51.08,>> Uh-uh. >> Ugh!
341,00:22:55.12,00:22:55.12,"Hmm. All right, I'll be back."
342,00:22:58.58,00:22:58.58,>> Bye. I am so sick of Yas doing
343,00:23:03.79,00:23:03.79,"absolutely nothing. She's, like, waiting around to"
344,00:23:06.33,00:23:06.33,"be taken care of like she's a little princess, so she's kind"
345,00:23:09.67,00:23:09.67,of frustrating and annoying. I think the reason our tribe is
346,00:23:25.62,00:23:25.62,working so well is because we are really focusing on bringing
347,00:23:29.17,00:23:29.17,our team as strong as possible to the merge.
348,00:23:31.83,00:23:31.83,But Yas is here for herself. She's not a team player.
349,00:23:35.21,00:23:35.21,She doesn't help out around camp.
350,00:23:37.42,00:23:37.42,And say we do lose a challenge. I think Yas would be the first

358,00:24:14.92,00:24:14.92,"for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
359,00:24:18.96,00:24:18.96,race across a net run carrying wooden blocks.
360,00:24:22.21,00:24:22.21,"When you reach the platform, you must stack the blocks one"
361,00:24:24.58,00:24:24.58,"on top of the other. Once you've completed the stack,"
362,00:24:27.67,00:24:27.67,you'll make your way across a rope bridge to another platform
363,00:24:30.67,00:24:30.67,where you will find more blocks. This will stack even higher.
364,00:24:35.21,00:24:35.21,"The first tribe to get both stacks completed wins immunity,"
365,00:24:39.08,00:24:39.08,"is safe from the vote. Losers-- Tribal Council, where"
366,00:24:42.33,00:24:42.33,somebody will be voted out of this game.

490,00:30:07.79,00:30:07.79,Everybody wants it. For the first time in this
491,00:30:12.29,00:30:12.29,"game, Foa Foa will not be going to Tribal Council."
492,00:30:16.12,00:30:16.12,Enjoy the night off. Grab your stuff.
493,00:30:18.04,00:30:18.04,Head back to camp. Congratulations.
494,00:30:20.67,00:30:20.67,"(thunder rumbles) Well, I don't know if Mother"

496,00:30:26.29,00:30:26.29,cloud over your head right now. Should be an interesting
497,00:30:28.62,00:30:28.62,afternoon figuring out who's going home.
498,00:30:30.62,00:30:30.62,Grab your stuff. I will see you at Tribal.
499,00:30:33.75,00:30:33.75,(thunder crackling) >> I saw Monica basically
500,00:30:37.71,00:30:37.71,disappear at that challenge. This is Survivor.
501,00:30:41.25,00:30:41.25,"This is about physical, mental toughness."
502,00:30:45.29,00:30:45.29,"And today, Monica just did not have it."
503,00:30:57.75,00:30:57.75,">> All right, so, I'm going to try and get this fire started,"
504,00:31:01.00,00:31:01.00,"and we will, uh, keep movin' and groovin' until it's time to do"
505,00:31:04.58,00:31:04.58,"what we got to do. Today, we lost our first"
506,00:31:09.04,00:31:09.04,"immunity challenge, and I just got pissed off."
507,00:31:12.04,00:31:12.04,That there was no reason why we should have lost.
508,00:31:14.92,00:31:14.92,"We had the lead the whole time, and then I kind of saw one"
509,00:31:19.29,00:31:19.29,"person kind of fall apart, and that was Monica."
510,00:31:23.12,00:31:23.12,"(sighs) >> In terms of the challenge,"
511,00:31:29.12,00:31:29.12,Monica screwed that up. There's no question in my mind.
512,00:31:34.62,00:31:34.62,>> She was terrible. >> She was terrible.
513,00:31:37.71,00:31:37.71,"She's a young girl, hanging out, having a good time."
514,00:31:41.92,00:31:41.92,It's like it's like Club Med or something.
515,00:31:45.29,00:31:45.29,As much as I hate to do that. >> Yeah.
516,00:32:00.25,00:32:00.25,>> What are we going to do about the vote tonight?
517,00:32:02.71,00:32:02.71,">> I don't know. >> Well, I don't know."
518,00:32:05.83,00:32:05.83,">> Well, I'd say that Sham's colossal screwups are kind of a"
519,00:32:11.04,00:32:11.04,shot to team morale. >> Are they?
520,00:32:13.67,00:32:13.67,">> Well, I mean... >> They're nonstop."
521,00:32:19.38,00:32:19.38,>> You know what I mean? >> I think she does the least
522,00:32:21.38,00:32:21.38,"out of everyone here. >> Yup, exactly."
523,00:32:23.38,00:32:23.38,>> Is that where we're going-- with Yas?
524,00:32:25.38,00:32:25.38,">> I mean, that's... >> As far as I'm concerned, Yas"
525,00:32:27.79,00:32:27.79,goes. >> We are going to our first
526,00:32:29.96,00:32:29.96,Tribal Council tonight. Some names are going about.
527,00:32:33.29,00:32:33.29,"For instance, Yas doesn't really do anything."
528,00:32:36.46,00:32:36.46,She basically sits by the fire and kind of observes things.
529,00:32:40.04,00:32:40.04,So that kind of gets annoying. So I think Yas might be going
530,00:32:43.21,00:32:43.21,"home tonight. But, hey, it is Survivor."
531,00:32:46.46,00:32:46.46,Crazier things have happened. >> You want to vote Monica out?
532,00:32:52.50,00:32:52.50,She took about 200% longer than anybody to run that rope.
533,00:32:55.04,00:32:55.04,>> Me and John was across that rope first and fast.
534,00:32:57.17,00:32:57.17,">> Right. >> So, that's why I'm saying I"
535,00:32:59.46,00:32:59.46,"can't worry about it, because I don't want the negativity."
536,00:33:01.54,00:33:01.54,>> Exactly. >> Whatever's going to happen is
537,00:33:03.54,00:33:03.54,"going to happen. >> See, that's how I am."
538,00:33:05.71,00:33:05.71,>> I know I haven't came up short. I'm sorry.
539,00:33:07.92,00:33:07.92,>> Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. >> You know what I'm saying?
540,00:33:09.92,00:33:09.92,"And around this camp, I ain't stepping up to do nothing"
541,00:33:11.96,00:33:11.96,because you know what these people do-- they prey on you
542,00:33:13.96,00:33:13.96,"doing something wrong, like letting the chicken go."
543,00:33:16.17,00:33:16.17,They prey on that. >> Yeah?
544,00:33:17.96,00:33:17.96,">> See, so therefore, nobody will be preying on me."
545,00:33:21.21,00:33:21.21,I've had my game face on since day one.
546,00:33:23.54,00:33:23.54,I'm here to play. And I did just that.
547,00:33:27.50,00:33:27.50,I've been running with the fellas and helping us win our
548,00:33:30.21,00:33:30.21,"challenges, and I'm not looking down on nobody."
549,00:33:33.00,00:33:33.00,"But, you know, Monica didn't help us win today."
550,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,"So if you want to penalize me for stepping up, then so be it."
551,00:33:39.67,00:33:39.67,"Vote me out, because my body could use a rest, damn it."
552,00:33:52.25,00:33:52.25,">> Russ, to me, sounds dead set on Monica."
553,00:33:55.17,00:33:55.17,">> I don't know. I mean, I like Monica."
554,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,You know what I mean? Like... >> There's a ton of crazy talk
555,00:34:06.38,00:34:06.38,"about voting Yas tonight. True, she doesn't do a lot of"
556,00:34:09.42,00:34:09.42,"work around here, but Yas is completely stronger in"

602,00:37:01.04,00:37:01.04,So I don't see how he figure I could be doing more.
603,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,I felt like that's the conversation him and I could've
604,00:37:06.62,00:37:06.62,"had beforehand, and I would've stepped it up."
605,00:37:08.08,00:37:08.08,Because I have not shied away from any work.
606,00:37:10.50,00:37:10.50,"And maybe I don't belong in a jungle because I have on heels,"
607,00:37:13.08,00:37:13.08,"but I wanted to dress up for you, Jeff, so I thought, you"

613,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,">> I mean, for me, challenges are your base."
614,00:37:29.92,00:37:29.92,"'Cause if the base isn't there, everything topples."
615,00:37:32.25,00:37:32.25,"So get the challenges done, the rest falls into place."
616,00:37:36.50,00:37:36.50,">> PROBST: Yasmin, you're shaking your head in agreement."
617,00:37:38.92,00:37:38.92,>> I'm very competitive at heart.

619,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,"compete. So I totally agree with Russell,"
620,00:37:46.21,00:37:46.21,101%. >> PROBST: So based on what you
621,00:37:48.33,00:37:48.33,"said, who could've given more at today's challenge?"

625,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,the challenge that put you here? >> It sucks.
626,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,"I mean, especially for me, I think I did a great job at the"
627,00:38:04.46,00:38:04.46,"challenge today. I mean, getting on the rope"
628,00:38:06.71,00:38:06.71,"originally, I had to kind of get my bearings, but once I got past"
629,00:38:09.38,00:38:09.38,"that, I think I really came back to my normal self."
630,00:38:13.46,00:38:13.46,">> PROBST: So, Dave, you can go camp life, you can go"
631,00:38:16.50,00:38:16.50,"challenges, or you can go individual strategy."
632,00:38:19.67,00:38:19.67,The problem with that is if you start making big moves too
633,00:38:22.25,00:38:22.25,"soon, you will destroy your tribe and it's only a matter of"
634,00:38:25.21,00:38:25.21,"time before you're gone. >> Uh, I think, ultimately,"
635,00:38:27.83,00:38:27.83,"what's good for the tribe is good for me, and so that's what"
636,00:38:31.08,00:38:31.08,"I'm basing my vote on. >> PROBST: Laura, do you agree"
637,00:38:34.62,00:38:34.62,with that? >> Number one for me is who's
638,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,really helping around the camp the most.
639,00:38:40.92,00:38:40.92,">> PROBST: All right, well, it sounds like there are a couple"
640,00:38:42.96,00:38:42.96,of different philosophies about how the vote should go tonight.
641,00:38:45.88,00:38:45.88,Let's see which one wins out. It is time to vote.
642,00:38:49.08,00:38:49.08,"Erik, you're up. >> (whispering): I don't feel"
643,00:39:09.54,00:39:09.54,"like you have carried your weight around camp, despite what"
644,00:39:12.12,00:39:12.12,you say. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
645,00:39:39.04,00:39:39.04,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
646,00:39:54.08,00:39:54.08,decision is final. The person voted out will be
647,00:39:56.12,00:39:56.12,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
648,00:39:58.67,00:39:58.67,I'll read the votes. First vote...
649,00:40:04.71,00:40:04.71,Yasmin. Yasmin.

651,00:40:15.58,00:40:15.58,"That's two votes Yasmin, one vote Monica."
652,00:40:20.04,00:40:20.04,Monica. Two votes Monica.
653,00:40:26.33,00:40:26.33,"Yas. That's three votes Yasmin, two"
654,00:40:28.75,00:40:28.75,votes Monica. Yasmin.
655,00:40:34.21,00:40:34.21,"That's four votes Yasmin, two votes Monica."
656,00:40:40.21,00:40:40.21,">> That's five votes Yasmin, two votes Monica."
657,00:40:47.04,00:40:47.04,">> Fourth person voted out of Survivor: Samoa, Yasmin."
658,00:40:50.21,00:40:50.21,That's six votes; that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.

663,00:41:24.25,00:41:24.25,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
