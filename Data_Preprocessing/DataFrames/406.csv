21,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,"members, Zoe, myself, John andTammy, we made ourselves a"
22,00:02:14.83,00:02:14.83,little pact that we're going totry to control this and take it
23,00:02:18.57,00:02:18.57,down to be the final fourpeople.
24,00:02:20.57,00:02:20.57,"And right about now, we'refeeling pretty confident that we"
25,00:02:23.97,00:02:23.97,"are in control.>> It's, like, no line of"
26,00:02:29.13,00:02:29.13,"B.S. what I'm saying.I mean, if we do it right, the"
27,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,winner will come out of thisgroup.
28,00:02:33.17,00:02:33.17,"I mean, I've been waiting for usto lose one so that I could,"
29,00:02:35.80,00:02:35.80,"you know, that I could get ridof Gabe, so..."
30,00:02:38.43,00:02:38.43,My leadership has emerged sincewe voted Gabe out.
31,00:02:41.87,00:02:41.87,"There was definitely a shift,basically now everyone knows I'm"
32,00:02:45.87,00:02:45.87,the leader.Everyone knows that I'm running
33,00:02:48.00,00:02:48.00,the show.If we were to lose our next
34,00:02:49.63,00:02:49.63,"immunity challenge, we're upfour-three."
35,00:02:51.43,00:02:51.43,"So to be honest, the rewardchallenge is the one that we"
36,00:02:54.10,00:02:54.10,"want today.No matter what it is, we just"
37,00:02:56.10,00:02:56.10,make sure our best personnel arethere.
38,00:02:58.03,00:02:58.03,And maybe not put as much focusand effort into the immunity
39,00:03:02.83,00:03:02.83,challenge that comes up afterthat.
40,00:03:05.10,00:03:05.10,>> John has made himself thepower guy in our little group.
41,00:03:09.03,00:03:09.03,"That's fine with me.Right now, it's time for me to"
42,00:03:12.60,00:03:12.60,"sit back, relax, let him takethe grief."
43,00:03:15.40,00:03:15.40,He's going to be the one who'sgoing to be the target.
44,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,>> Maybe it's my new tribalbaptism or whatever you want to
45,00:03:25.60,00:03:25.60,"call it, but I got silly anddecided to go skinny-dipping."
46,00:03:29.50,00:03:29.50,"Hey, Rob, I'm going to jump offnaked."
47,00:03:34.37,00:03:34.37,"There I was with the originalRotu people, and after voting"
48,00:03:38.63,00:03:38.63,"Gabe out, it was like being ableto wash off all that other stuff"
49,00:03:41.87,00:03:41.87,and like starting new.That was definitely a powerful
50,00:03:48.57,00:03:48.57,"moment.Symbolically, it's just showing"
51,00:03:50.53,00:03:50.53,that there's another levelof our relationship with
52,00:03:52.90,00:03:52.90,each other.I would not be comfortable doing
53,00:03:55.33,00:03:55.33,"that with the other three.>> Only chance we got now, hope"
54,00:04:03.97,00:04:03.97,"we win immunity tomorrow, andthere's a merge."
55,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,We've got to hook something upwith the other side.
56,00:04:10.17,00:04:10.17,"Otherwise, we're going out.Without a doubt, we're"
57,00:04:14.17,00:04:14.17,"outnumbered 4-3.By losing Gabe, we definitely"
58,00:04:17.80,00:04:17.80,put ourselves at a bigdisadvantage.
59,00:04:20.70,00:04:20.70,"We know they got four, we gotthree."
60,00:04:24.07,00:04:24.07,They're knocking us off one at atime.
61,00:04:26.73,00:04:26.73,And these smoochers...>> And V.'s definitely...
62,00:04:28.97,00:04:28.97,"I don't know what V. is doing,but she's definitely"
63,00:04:31.77,00:04:31.77,disassociating herself fromus in a real clear and
64,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,visible manner.>> V's driving me crazy because
65,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,it's just so obvious what she'sdoing.
66,00:04:40.53,00:04:40.53,I don't trust V.I never trusted V.
67,00:04:45.33,00:04:45.33,"I'll tell you one thing, Sean,my main goal is to get rid of"
68,00:04:48.47,00:04:48.47,him.Just because he's so full of it.
69,00:04:51.60,00:04:51.60,"If I have any opportunity atall to get rid of John, I will."
70,00:04:54.80,00:04:54.80,"I don't have an angle yet.I don't have a strategy yet, but"
71,00:04:58.13,00:04:58.13,"if I have any opportunity at allto get rid of him, he will be"
72,00:05:01.63,00:05:01.63,the first to go.And if we lose the immunity
73,00:05:04.00,00:05:04.00,"tomorrow, yeah, it's probablygoing to be me or you."
74,00:05:23.10,00:05:23.10,">> On this side, there's moretime to be casual because you"
75,00:05:26.13,00:05:26.13,don't have to work at gatheringfood.
76,00:05:28.07,00:05:28.07,It's just right at yourfingertips.
77,00:05:29.87,00:05:29.87,">> Paschal, did you find any?>> Well, I see one."
78,00:05:34.63,00:05:34.63,"Where there's one, there's more.Physically, we're not a match"
79,00:05:37.90,00:05:37.90,for the other team and weknow that.
80,00:05:39.70,00:05:39.70,But we just approach it as bestwe can.
81,00:05:42.27,00:05:42.27,"I mean, you can only do what youcan do and you can't worry about"
82,00:05:44.17,00:05:44.17,"it.>> Holy Mother McGrady, look at"
83,00:05:46.90,00:05:46.90,this dude!>> You got that side?
84,00:05:49.13,00:05:49.13,>> I got this side.>> Good job.
85,00:05:52.03,00:05:52.03,>> I was always concerned thathaving this small little band of
86,00:05:55.27,00:05:55.27,women and one older gentlemanwas going to be very difficult
87,00:05:59.23,00:05:59.23,"to win.But now that I'm here, it's"
88,00:06:01.60,00:06:01.60,totally about spirit and energyand desire.
89,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,">> Oh, baby come here.Where is that pincher?"
90,00:06:07.67,00:06:07.67,"Oh, no, you don't!No, you don't."
91,00:06:09.80,00:06:09.80,Golly...>> You booger!
92,00:06:15.57,00:06:15.57,You booger!Booger head!
93,00:06:17.53,00:06:17.53,No!(yells)
94,00:06:26.27,00:06:26.27,">> You sorry sun of a gun, you!Wow, he got me double."
95,00:06:31.27,00:06:31.27,">> Damn!Woo, look at that."
96,00:06:34.03,00:06:34.03,"Oh, my God.No wonder it hurts to get"
97,00:06:37.70,00:06:37.70,pinched.We did not eat as well at Rotu
98,00:06:40.07,00:06:40.07,because we had more tribemembers and less food.
99,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,>> We'll have to bowl them upright away.
100,00:06:44.93,00:06:44.93,">> We did not eat in themorning, we did not eat at"
101,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,"lunch, we only had dinner.That was great, Paschal."
102,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,I was just waiting for them topop out of the hole.
103,00:06:53.50,00:06:53.50,">> Yeah, you've got to, if youjust find one going back."
104,00:06:57.23,00:06:57.23,">> Yeah, that was timing.>> Okay, we know where to come"
105,00:07:01.73,00:07:01.73,anyway.There you go.
106,00:07:02.97,00:07:02.97,"Good one, Kathy.>> Yeah."
107,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,"God, they're strong.>> If we can win this one, the"
108,00:07:16.10,00:07:16.10,"way we're eating, and you knowwhat they're eating."
109,00:07:18.87,00:07:18.87,You got to believe what they'renot eating.
110,00:07:20.67,00:07:20.67,">> I think they're more worriedabout the food than immunity,"
111,00:07:23.50,00:07:23.50,because they probably alreadyhave their alliance.
112,00:07:25.20,00:07:25.20,They already know who they'regoing to boot.
113,00:07:26.73,00:07:26.73,>> I'm totally looking forwardto see which one of my old
114,00:07:29.70,00:07:29.70,members got kicked off.>> It's going to be a shock to
115,00:07:32.40,00:07:32.40,"us if it wasn't one of her oldmembers, because I think we're"
116,00:07:35.40,00:07:35.40,all assuming it's going to beone of two people.
117,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,">> I think it's going to be Rob,the others think it's going to"
118,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,be Sean.So it will be interesting to
119,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,"find out.>> You guys, this is done."
120,00:07:45.63,00:07:45.63,>> The food over on this side isso much easier to get to than
121,00:07:49.53,00:07:49.53,"the food over at Rotu.It's just, it's unbelievable,"
122,00:07:53.03,00:07:53.03,it's like night and day.>> And it's so fresh.
123,00:07:55.87,00:07:55.87,">> We don't need the food likethey need it, I'm confident of"
124,00:07:57.53,00:07:57.53,that.>> Let's see what do we got
125,00:08:10.50,00:08:10.50,today.Oh.
126,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,"Sushi?>> Oh, it's going to be food!"
127,00:08:14.47,00:08:14.47,">> Yeah, it is.>> ""It's time to visit a"
128,00:08:17.37,00:08:17.37,mystical place.The perfect setting for your
129,00:08:20.57,00:08:20.57,"next race.Across land and sea, in the"
130,00:08:23.63,00:08:23.63,"fastest time, the first tribefinished sits down to dine!"""
131,00:08:28.63,00:08:28.63,Yes!>> There is no way they're
132,00:08:32.50,00:08:32.50,going to beat us.>> No way.
133,00:08:33.90,00:08:33.90,">> No way in hell, and if thereis any food at the finish line,"
134,00:08:36.70,00:08:36.70,"that's motivation enough.>> Rock and roll, man."
135,00:08:39.43,00:08:39.43,>> Rotu!>> They voted Gabe off.
136,00:08:57.13,00:08:57.13,>> Oh!>> What?
137,00:09:05.80,00:09:05.80,">> PROBST: Right in front here,Rob."

266,00:18:31.80,00:18:31.80,kinds of good food.And we're over here eating

269,00:18:42.80,00:18:42.80,And I avoided apologizing.Because I am in a leadership

275,00:19:03.53,00:19:03.53,High.We would bloat up in a second.

398,00:26:01.63,00:26:01.63,going to vote out Gabe.Your behavior to me completely
399,00:26:04.40,00:26:04.40,changed and you were trying tofigure out maybe another

420,00:27:03.03,00:27:03.03,"shouldn't.Are you gay, dude?"

422,00:27:08.57,00:27:08.57,">> Yeah, I am.It was very passive aggressive,"
423,00:27:11.30,00:27:11.30,"like a throw away comment, ""Hey,are you gay?"""
424,00:27:13.40,00:27:13.40,"But, you know, hey, I'm 36 yearsold."
425,00:27:15.30,00:27:15.30,"I've been out for a long time,so I said, ""Yeah, you know, I"

427,00:27:20.83,00:27:20.83,you know.But this 36-year-old gay boy
428,00:27:23.47,00:27:23.47,from Omaha is running the showand just whipping his pants.
429,00:27:41.53,00:27:41.53,>> This immunity challenge iscritical to me.
430,00:27:44.50,00:27:44.50,"If we don't win this challenge,then I'm probably gone tomorrow."
431,00:27:48.27,00:27:48.27,"Sean, V. and Tammy definitelyhave to play in today's immunity"

439,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,"I'm just saying, I mean, I'mtrying to stay two steps ahead."
440,00:28:23.73,00:28:23.73,Rob is desperate to dosomething.
441,00:28:25.97,00:28:25.97,I think we sit in a much betterplace if we don't have Rob at
442,00:28:30.07,00:28:30.07,"the merge, period.He is a little bit dangerous and"
443,00:28:32.87,00:28:32.87,we have one opportunity to getrid of him.
444,00:28:34.83,00:28:34.83,My gut is screaming to me thatit would be better if we
445,00:28:37.83,00:28:37.83,"actually lost this challenge andlost that voice, and that person"
446,00:28:42.70,00:28:42.70,that Rob represents that's sodangerous.

448,00:28:47.73,00:28:47.73,I can't go in there and not try.>> Just don't do anything extra

450,00:28:52.13,00:28:52.13,I'm serious.We're talking a million dollars
451,00:28:53.67,00:28:53.67,is at stake here.What I was trying to say to
452,00:28:55.80,00:28:55.80,Tammy is there are certainbattles that you definitely need
453,00:28:59.03,00:28:59.03,to win and there are certainbattles that you don't.
454,00:29:01.97,00:29:01.97,>> I hate the fact that I'm inthis challenge and you don't
455,00:29:04.47,00:29:04.47,want to win this.>> I don't know what to tell
456,00:29:06.47,00:29:06.47,"you, it's better if he's justgone."

561,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57,">> As much as we were burning,we just didn't burn enough of a"
562,00:36:02.57,00:36:02.57,"bed today.>> You don't have to, I mean..."
563,00:36:07.03,00:36:07.03,I don't think that's going tolight.
564,00:36:09.47,00:36:09.47,>> We just don't have fire.>> I was hoping that we would go
565,00:36:14.63,00:36:14.63,to Tribal Council and votetonight after having a
566,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43,conversation.But I went to talk to Gina about
567,00:36:20.20,00:36:20.20,it and she felt that weshouldn't talk about it.
568,00:36:23.20,00:36:23.20,So I'm not going to bring it up.>> These guys do not like to
569,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,"break through this.>> No, they don't."
570,00:36:30.77,00:36:30.77,>> I don't think they haveenough guts right now to talk
571,00:36:34.00,00:36:34.00,"about it.I totally disagree with that, I"
572,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,"think we should just own up toit, man, just put it on the"
573,00:36:38.80,00:36:38.80,table and figure it out andenjoy the rest of the day.
574,00:36:41.40,00:36:41.40,>> We are out of fire.>> Out of fire?
575,00:36:45.63,00:36:45.63,>> No fire.>> At all? For sure?
576,00:36:49.07,00:36:49.07,"We know that one of us is goingto have to go, and it's a hard"
577,00:36:53.87,00:36:53.87,decision.I don't think they're going to
578,00:36:56.10,00:36:56.10,vote for me just because Iwasn't with them originally.
579,00:36:58.83,00:36:58.83,"And I might be wrong, but Idon't feel that way."
580,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,I just don't like that sand ideashe uses.
581,00:37:05.77,00:37:05.77,"That's how you put out fires.>> That's what I thought, too."
582,00:37:09.37,00:37:09.37,">> If I work at strategizing formyself, I'd have to vote on"
583,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,"Kathy, because I automaticallyknow that Neleh nor Paschal are"
584,00:37:17.77,00:37:17.77,going to vote on each other.Have you eaten those raw before?
585,00:37:22.73,00:37:22.73,>> Hmm-mm.>> You need lemon.
586,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,>> They're hard as a rock.>> I'm not going to start
587,00:37:28.57,00:37:28.57,"tonight either.>> Honestly, I haven't decide"
588,00:37:31.10,00:37:31.10,what I'm going to do.I've been back and forth all
589,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,day.I definitely know I'm not going
590,00:37:36.17,00:37:36.17,"to vote Paschal, but betweenKathy and Gina, I'm having a"
591,00:37:39.20,00:37:39.20,"really tough time.>> Look, on the other side, we"
592,00:37:40.97,00:37:40.97,went to bed many a night withoutanything.
593,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50,>> We're going to go to TribalCouncil tonight and each member
594,00:37:49.43,00:37:49.43,is going to get up and vote andit will be a secret until that
595,00:37:52.43,00:37:52.43,"very moment.>> PROBST: Okay, let's get right"
596,00:38:21.50,00:38:21.50,to it.A lot has happened.
597,00:38:22.87,00:38:22.87,"This small little tribe of four,the true underdogs, has come on"
598,00:38:27.10,00:38:27.10,"very strong.Paschal, what kind of tribe is"
599,00:38:29.70,00:38:29.70,this?How different are things now
600,00:38:31.50,00:38:31.50,from the last time you guys werehere?
601,00:38:33.53,00:38:33.53,>> If you would have told mewhen I left Rotu that we were
602,00:38:36.70,00:38:36.70,"going to duplicate what we hadat Rotu, I'd say there's no way."
603,00:38:40.20,00:38:40.20,"Not only have we duplicated it,we have surpassed it."
604,00:38:43.17,00:38:43.17,>> PROBST: Really.So let's talk about loyalties
605,00:38:45.97,00:38:45.97,"then.Kathy, where are your loyalties"
606,00:38:48.57,00:38:48.57,now?>> I think there's a spirit of
607,00:38:50.50,00:38:50.50,Rotu still lurking about over onthe other beach.
608,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,"But it's diminished, and we'vereally formed something here"
609,00:38:56.47,00:38:56.47,that's united.I think both tribes have
610,00:38:58.77,00:38:58.77,dissipated and we're creatingsomething new.
611,00:39:01.53,00:39:01.53,">> PROBST: If you mergedtonight, would the four of you"
612,00:39:04.03,00:39:04.03,"go in together or would it behey, Gina, really been fun,"
613,00:39:06.87,00:39:06.87,we're going to see if we caninfiltrate back into the
614,00:39:09.77,00:39:09.77,"strength of the numbers of Rotu?>> No, we would go as the four"
615,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,"of us, strong.>> Absolutely, four of us."
616,00:39:16.87,00:39:16.87,>> PROBST: Neleh.>> Absolutely.
617,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,">> PROBST: How about you, Gina?Are you still a black sheep or"
618,00:39:22.03,00:39:22.03,are you truly now a tribe offour?
619,00:39:23.60,00:39:23.60,>> We're definitely a tribe.I would definitely call it even
620,00:39:26.53,00:39:26.53,like a family.We don't want to vote anybody
621,00:39:28.73,00:39:28.73,"off tonight.>> PROBST: Kathy, let's talk"
622,00:39:30.50,00:39:30.50,about the immunity challengeyesterday.
623,00:39:32.07,00:39:32.07,You were dragging these guyslike they were school kids who
624,00:39:34.40,00:39:34.40,"didn't want to get up.At any point, did you think,"
625,00:39:36.87,00:39:36.87,"yikes, I hope we're still atribe here and I hope they're"
626,00:39:40.03,00:39:40.03,not going to make me ascapegoat?
627,00:39:41.87,00:39:41.87,>> My head hung low because Ifelt that I failed the tribe on
628,00:39:44.83,00:39:44.83,the challenge.But the other thing is that
629,00:39:46.93,00:39:46.93,"there's such a family feelingbetween the four of us, that I"
630,00:39:50.00,00:39:50.00,felt okay once we got outsidethe maze and we got back to
631,00:39:55.40,00:39:55.40,camp.>> PROBST: So if you guys are
632,00:39:57.03,00:39:57.03,"such a tight family, how are yougoing to vote tonight?"

634,00:40:01.80,00:40:01.80,">> Every ten minutes, I probablyam thinking someone different."
635,00:40:04.47,00:40:04.47,"That's how many times it's gonethrough my head today, because I"
636,00:40:07.93,00:40:07.93,do not want anybody to go.>> PROBST: Have you made your
637,00:40:10.73,00:40:10.73,decision now?>> Honestly I haven't.
638,00:40:13.53,00:40:13.53,>> PROBST: Okay.It's time to vote.

649,00:42:22.53,00:42:22.53,"Well, you guys kept insisting onusing the word ""family"" tonight"
650,00:42:26.30,00:42:26.30,"instead of tribe.Sometimes, families have to make"
651,00:42:29.33,00:42:29.33,hard decisions.I'm sure this has been one of
652,00:42:31.63,00:42:31.63,the hardest.You guys can head back to camp.
