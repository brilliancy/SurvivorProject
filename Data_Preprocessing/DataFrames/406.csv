1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:01.77,00:00:01.77, Survivor... Maraamu found a new source of
3,00:00:03.93,00:00:03.93,food... (screams)
4,00:00:05.37,00:00:05.37,...and won a crucial reward challenge and got to raid
5,00:00:08.53,00:00:08.53,"Rotu's camp... Maraamu, prepare to raid."
6,00:00:10.83,00:00:10.83,>> It was amazing. We got everything.
7,00:00:12.93,00:00:12.93,>> PROBST: ...which caused Rotu to become a more unified tribe.
8,00:00:15.63,00:00:15.63,>> Everyone just felt like they had a purpose in the tribe.
9,00:00:19.13,00:00:19.13,>> PROBST: But unity was fleeting when John became
10,00:00:21.27,00:00:21.27,suspicious of Gabe's behavior. >> Are we staying tight?
11,00:00:23.67,00:00:23.67,Is that the deal? >> PROBST: The tiny Maraamu
12,00:00:25.80,00:00:25.80,tribe also won their first immunity.
13,00:00:27.57,00:00:27.57,(cheering) And John took steps to oust
14,00:00:31.03,00:00:31.03,"Gabe. >> We vote Gabe, tomorrow."
15,00:00:33.10,00:00:33.10,">> PROBST: Rotu went to their first Tribal Council, where Rob"
16,00:00:35.70,00:00:35.70,"went along with the vote, but had a message for John."
17,00:00:38.37,00:00:38.37,>> I know exactly what you're doing.
18,00:00:40.10,00:00:40.10,"First chance I get, I'm going to get you."
19,00:00:42.10,00:00:42.10,>> PROBST: And Gabe was voted out of the tribe.
20,00:00:43.97,00:00:43.97,"Gabe, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left."
21,00:00:50.03,00:00:50.03,Who will be voted out tonight? >> The four original Rotu
22,00:02:10.17,00:02:10.17,"members, Zoe, myself, John and Tammy, we made ourselves a"
23,00:02:14.83,00:02:14.83,little pact that we're going to try to control this and take it
24,00:02:18.57,00:02:18.57,down to be the final four people.
25,00:02:20.57,00:02:20.57,"And right about now, we're feeling pretty confident that we"
26,00:02:23.97,00:02:23.97,"are in control. >> It's, like, no line of"
27,00:02:29.13,00:02:29.13,"B.S. what I'm saying. I mean, if we do it right, the"
28,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,winner will come out of this group.
29,00:02:33.17,00:02:33.17,"I mean, I've been waiting for us to lose one so that I could,"
30,00:02:35.80,00:02:35.80,"you know, that I could get rid of Gabe, so..."
31,00:02:38.43,00:02:38.43,My leadership has emerged since we voted Gabe out.
32,00:02:41.87,00:02:41.87,"There was definitely a shift, basically now everyone knows I'm"
33,00:02:45.87,00:02:45.87,the leader. Everyone knows that I'm running
34,00:02:48.00,00:02:48.00,the show. If we were to lose our next
35,00:02:49.63,00:02:49.63,"immunity challenge, we're up four-three."
36,00:02:51.43,00:02:51.43,"So to be honest, the reward challenge is the one that we"
37,00:02:54.10,00:02:54.10,"want today. No matter what it is, we just"
38,00:02:56.10,00:02:56.10,make sure our best personnel are there.
39,00:02:58.03,00:02:58.03,And maybe not put as much focus and effort into the immunity
40,00:03:02.83,00:03:02.83,challenge that comes up after that.
41,00:03:05.10,00:03:05.10,>> John has made himself the power guy in our little group.
42,00:03:09.03,00:03:09.03,"That's fine with me. Right now, it's time for me to"
43,00:03:12.60,00:03:12.60,"sit back, relax, let him take the grief."
44,00:03:15.40,00:03:15.40,He's going to be the one who's going to be the target.
45,00:03:22.13,00:03:22.13,>> Maybe it's my new tribal baptism or whatever you want to
46,00:03:25.60,00:03:25.60,"call it, but I got silly and decided to go skinny-dipping."
47,00:03:29.50,00:03:29.50,"Hey, Rob, I'm going to jump off naked."
48,00:03:34.37,00:03:34.37,"There I was with the original Rotu people, and after voting"
49,00:03:38.63,00:03:38.63,"Gabe out, it was like being able to wash off all that other stuff"
50,00:03:41.87,00:03:41.87,and like starting new. That was definitely a powerful
51,00:03:48.57,00:03:48.57,"moment. Symbolically, it's just showing"
52,00:03:50.53,00:03:50.53,that there's another level of our relationship with
53,00:03:52.90,00:03:52.90,each other. I would not be comfortable doing
54,00:03:55.33,00:03:55.33,"that with the other three. >> Only chance we got now, hope"
55,00:04:03.97,00:04:03.97,"we win immunity tomorrow, and there's a merge."
56,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,We've got to hook something up with the other side.
57,00:04:10.17,00:04:10.17,"Otherwise, we're going out. Without a doubt, we're"
58,00:04:14.17,00:04:14.17,"outnumbered 4-3. By losing Gabe, we definitely"
59,00:04:17.80,00:04:17.80,put ourselves at a big disadvantage.
60,00:04:20.70,00:04:20.70,"We know they got four, we got three."
61,00:04:24.07,00:04:24.07,They're knocking us off one at a time.
62,00:04:26.73,00:04:26.73,And these smoochers... >> And V.'s definitely...
63,00:04:28.97,00:04:28.97,"I don't know what V. is doing, but she's definitely"
64,00:04:31.77,00:04:31.77,disassociating herself from us in a real clear and
65,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,visible manner. >> V's driving me crazy because
66,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,it's just so obvious what she's doing.
67,00:04:40.53,00:04:40.53,I don't trust V. I never trusted V.
68,00:04:45.33,00:04:45.33,"I'll tell you one thing, Sean, my main goal is to get rid of"
69,00:04:48.47,00:04:48.47,him. Just because he's so full of it.
70,00:04:51.60,00:04:51.60,"If I have any opportunity at all to get rid of John, I will."
71,00:04:54.80,00:04:54.80,"I don't have an angle yet. I don't have a strategy yet, but"
72,00:04:58.13,00:04:58.13,"if I have any opportunity at all to get rid of him, he will be"
73,00:05:01.63,00:05:01.63,the first to go. And if we lose the immunity
74,00:05:04.00,00:05:04.00,"tomorrow, yeah, it's probably going to be me or you."
75,00:05:23.10,00:05:23.10,">> On this side, there's more time to be casual because you"
76,00:05:26.13,00:05:26.13,don't have to work at gathering food.
77,00:05:28.07,00:05:28.07,It's just right at your fingertips.
78,00:05:29.87,00:05:29.87,">> Paschal, did you find any? >> Well, I see one."
79,00:05:34.63,00:05:34.63,"Where there's one, there's more. Physically, we're not a match"
80,00:05:37.90,00:05:37.90,for the other team and we know that.
81,00:05:39.70,00:05:39.70,But we just approach it as best we can.
82,00:05:42.27,00:05:42.27,"I mean, you can only do what you can do and you can't worry about"
83,00:05:44.17,00:05:44.17,"it. >> Holy Mother McGrady, look at"
84,00:05:46.90,00:05:46.90,this dude! >> You got that side?
85,00:05:49.13,00:05:49.13,>> I got this side. >> Good job.
86,00:05:52.03,00:05:52.03,>> I was always concerned that having this small little band of
87,00:05:55.27,00:05:55.27,women and one older gentleman was going to be very difficult
88,00:05:59.23,00:05:59.23,"to win. But now that I'm here, it's"
89,00:06:01.60,00:06:01.60,totally about spirit and energy and desire.
90,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,">> Oh, baby come here. Where is that pincher?"
91,00:06:07.67,00:06:07.67,"Oh, no, you don't! No, you don't."
92,00:06:09.80,00:06:09.80,Golly... >> You booger!
93,00:06:15.57,00:06:15.57,You booger! Booger head!
94,00:06:17.53,00:06:17.53,No! (yells)
95,00:06:26.27,00:06:26.27,">> You sorry sun of a gun, you! Wow, he got me double."
96,00:06:31.27,00:06:31.27,">> Damn! Woo, look at that."
97,00:06:34.03,00:06:34.03,"Oh, my God. No wonder it hurts to get"
98,00:06:37.70,00:06:37.70,pinched. We did not eat as well at Rotu
99,00:06:40.07,00:06:40.07,because we had more tribe members and less food.
100,00:06:42.87,00:06:42.87,>> We'll have to bowl them up right away.
101,00:06:44.93,00:06:44.93,">> We did not eat in the morning, we did not eat at"
102,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,"lunch, we only had dinner. That was great, Paschal."
103,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,I was just waiting for them to pop out of the hole.
104,00:06:53.50,00:06:53.50,">> Yeah, you've got to, if you just find one going back."
105,00:06:57.23,00:06:57.23,">> Yeah, that was timing. >> Okay, we know where to come"
106,00:07:01.73,00:07:01.73,anyway. There you go.
107,00:07:02.97,00:07:02.97,"Good one, Kathy. >> Yeah."
108,00:07:06.67,00:07:06.67,"God, they're strong. >> If we can win this one, the"
109,00:07:16.10,00:07:16.10,"way we're eating, and you know what they're eating."
110,00:07:18.87,00:07:18.87,You got to believe what they're not eating.
111,00:07:20.67,00:07:20.67,">> I think they're more worried about the food than immunity,"
112,00:07:23.50,00:07:23.50,because they probably already have their alliance.
113,00:07:25.20,00:07:25.20,They already know who they're going to boot.
114,00:07:26.73,00:07:26.73,>> I'm totally looking forward to see which one of my old
115,00:07:29.70,00:07:29.70,members got kicked off. >> It's going to be a shock to
116,00:07:32.40,00:07:32.40,"us if it wasn't one of her old members, because I think we're"
117,00:07:35.40,00:07:35.40,all assuming it's going to be one of two people.
118,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,">> I think it's going to be Rob, the others think it's going to"
119,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,be Sean. So it will be interesting to
120,00:07:42.17,00:07:42.17,"find out. >> You guys, this is done."
121,00:07:45.63,00:07:45.63,>> The food over on this side is so much easier to get to than
122,00:07:49.53,00:07:49.53,"the food over at Rotu. It's just, it's unbelievable,"
123,00:07:53.03,00:07:53.03,it's like night and day. >> And it's so fresh.
124,00:07:55.87,00:07:55.87,">> We don't need the food like they need it, I'm confident of"
125,00:07:57.53,00:07:57.53,that. >> Let's see what do we got
126,00:08:10.50,00:08:10.50,today. Oh.
127,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,"Sushi? >> Oh, it's going to be food!"
128,00:08:14.47,00:08:14.47,">> Yeah, it is. >> ""It's time to visit a"
129,00:08:17.37,00:08:17.37,mystical place. The perfect setting for your
130,00:08:20.57,00:08:20.57,"next race. Across land and sea, in the"
131,00:08:23.63,00:08:23.63,"fastest time, the first tribe finished sits down to dine!"""
132,00:08:28.63,00:08:28.63,Yes! >> There is no way they're
133,00:08:32.50,00:08:32.50,going to beat us. >> No way.
134,00:08:33.90,00:08:33.90,">> No way in hell, and if there is any food at the finish line,"
135,00:08:36.70,00:08:36.70,"that's motivation enough. >> Rock and roll, man."
136,00:08:39.43,00:08:39.43,>> Rotu! >> They voted Gabe off.
137,00:08:57.13,00:08:57.13,>> Oh! >> What?
138,00:09:05.80,00:09:05.80,">> PROBST: Right in front here, Rob."
139,00:09:13.70,00:09:13.70,"Okay, let's get to today's reward challenge."
140,00:09:16.90,00:09:16.90,It is a jungle relay race. Here's how it works.
141,00:09:19.63,00:09:19.63,Four members from each tribe will compete.
142,00:09:21.83,00:09:21.83,There are three legs to the relay.
143,00:09:23.63,00:09:23.63,"In the first leg, one member of each tribe will race through the"
144,00:09:27.17,00:09:27.17,jungle until you reach a paddle. It's tied with knots.
145,00:09:30.20,00:09:30.20,"You'll untie it and continue on, tagging a tribe member along"
146,00:09:33.93,00:09:33.93,the way. You must stay together.
147,00:09:35.93,00:09:35.93,Both of you will find another paddle that's tied up.
148,00:09:39.23,00:09:39.23,"You'll carry both paddles to the second leg, which is a pile of"
149,00:09:42.37,00:09:42.37,coconuts. Hidden inside is a key.
150,00:09:44.63,00:09:44.63,Start breaking the coconuts open until you find it.
151,00:09:46.93,00:09:46.93,Then pass the key and the paddles off to the other two
152,00:09:49.50,00:09:49.50,"members of your tribe. For the third and final leg,"
153,00:09:52.23,00:09:52.23,those two members will use the key to unlock your outrigger
154,00:09:55.77,00:09:55.77,"canoe. You'll paddle out, retrieve your"
155,00:09:58.03,00:09:58.03,"flag, turn around, paddle back, and drop your boat on the beach."
156,00:10:01.67,00:10:01.67,The outrigger must be within reach of your chain.
157,00:10:04.67,00:10:04.67,First tribe to get both paddlers back to the tiki and place their
158,00:10:08.43,00:10:08.43,flag on top wins reward. Want to know what you're playing
159,00:10:11.03,00:10:11.03,for? >> Yes.
160,00:10:12.87,00:10:12.87,">> PROBST: First thing, nice, hot, humid day like today,"
161,00:10:15.77,00:10:15.77,"something a little cold, a little Sierra Mist."
162,00:10:18.20,00:10:18.20,">> Oh, that's so cold, look at it."
163,00:10:21.77,00:10:21.77,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Here's a little
164,00:10:25.43,00:10:25.43,sampling of what's waiting for you.
165,00:10:27.07,00:10:27.07,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: Chicken, quiche, bean"
166,00:10:32.37,00:10:32.37,salad and a really nice dessert.
167,00:10:35.63,00:10:35.63,"Okay. Rotu, because you have seven"
168,00:10:39.70,00:10:39.70,"members, you're sitting three out."
169,00:10:41.13,00:10:41.13,"Which four are participating? Okay, V., Sean, Tammy, you guys"
170,00:10:45.63,00:10:45.63,"are sitting this one out. First two, head to the start,"
171,00:10:49.30,00:10:49.30,"wait for my go. Here we go, guys."
172,00:10:51.97,00:10:51.97,Survivors ready! Go!
173,00:11:14.73,00:11:14.73,">> Take it easy, Rob! >> Go, Paschal!"
174,00:11:21.43,00:11:21.43,"Go, baby! Come on, Paps, you got it."
175,00:11:34.00,00:11:34.00,">> Take it easy, Rob. >> Good job, Paps!"
176,00:11:48.40,00:11:48.40,"Come on, Paps, you got it. >> Want me to hold the paddle?"
177,00:11:57.23,00:11:57.23,">> I got it, I got it. >> I see it, the change in the"
178,00:12:00.37,00:12:00.37,knot right there. >> They change it halfway.
179,00:12:02.90,00:12:02.90,">> Very good, nice and steady. >> Okay, Paps, ready?"
180,00:12:13.17,00:12:13.17,">> Go. >> Let's go, Paschal!"
181,00:12:26.40,00:12:26.40,">> Let's go, Rob. All right, you can do it!"
182,00:12:29.93,00:12:29.93,>> Come on. >> Take your time.
183,00:12:31.77,00:12:31.77,">> Take your time, take your time."
184,00:12:33.90,00:12:33.90,">> Come on, Paschal! >> We got it, come on."
185,00:12:45.53,00:12:45.53,>> Go! >> The paddle!
186,00:12:48.97,00:12:48.97,"The paddle! The paddle! >> Ready? One, two, three."
187,00:13:02.97,00:13:02.97,>> Which side? Come on...
188,00:13:07.73,00:13:07.73,"Rob, stop, stop, stop. >> One on one side, one on the"

190,00:13:17.27,00:13:17.27,Turn us around. Row on the outside this time.
191,00:13:22.23,00:13:22.23,>> What are they doing? >> You guys!
192,00:13:32.83,00:13:32.83,">> I'll go on the inside, you go on the outside."
193,00:13:35.53,00:13:35.53,">> PROBST: You're still in this, let's go!"
194,00:13:37.73,00:13:37.73,">> Come on, you guys! >> Steer, steer, you need to"
195,00:13:50.83,00:13:50.83,"steer. I'm rowing, you steer."
196,00:13:52.60,00:13:52.60,"Steer. >> Come on, girls, way to go!"
197,00:13:56.43,00:13:56.43,">> Steer, steer, steer. >> Good job, girls."
198,00:14:00.77,00:14:00.77,">> Rob, steer, don't row! I'm going to row."
199,00:14:03.80,00:14:03.80,Steer. Put your paddle in.
200,00:14:05.23,00:14:05.23,"There you go. >> Good job, come on, guys!"
201,00:14:07.97,00:14:07.97,">> Sharp, sharp, sharp. >> Come on!"
202,00:14:13.27,00:14:13.27,"Oh, yes. (cheering)"
203,00:14:21.53,00:14:21.53,">> Come on! >> Come on, Rotu!"
204,00:14:24.87,00:14:24.87,>> Go! (all yelling encouragement)
205,00:14:39.60,00:14:39.60,>> PROBST: Pull it to your chain.
206,00:14:41.47,00:14:41.47,"Pull it to your chain! >> Come on, guys."
207,00:14:44.70,00:14:44.70,"Come on! >> Push, push."
208,00:14:56.60,00:14:56.60,Run! >> Get the flag!
209,00:14:58.60,00:14:58.60,Get the flag! >> PROBST: Rotu!
210,00:15:16.90,00:15:16.90,>> Rob wasn't here. Rob wasn't here.
211,00:15:19.47,00:15:19.47,>> You're right. >> Rob wasn't here!
212,00:15:22.00,00:15:22.00,">> PROBST: Hold up, I got to check something."
213,00:15:24.67,00:15:24.67,"Maraamu is protesting. To win, your boat has to be"
214,00:15:27.33,00:15:27.33,"within a chain length, and both paddlers have to be at the tiki."
215,00:15:31.33,00:15:31.33,"The boat has to be within the chain link, Maraamu's boat is"
216,00:15:35.00,00:15:35.00,all right. Rotu's boat is not okay.
217,00:15:40.47,00:15:40.47,"In addition, the General was not at the tiki when you put your"
218,00:15:43.77,00:15:43.77,"flag in. I spoke too soon, I'm sorry."
219,00:15:46.30,00:15:46.30,"Rotu, you do not win. Maraamu wins."
220,00:15:48.83,00:15:48.83,Feast. >> Yes!
221,00:16:12.40,00:16:12.40,">> Oh, my God, look it's a picnic!"
222,00:16:15.37,00:16:15.37,">> I love picnics. >> Oh, my gosh."
223,00:16:22.50,00:16:22.50,">> Oh, my God, look at all the drinks!"
224,00:16:24.77,00:16:24.77,"Oh, my God, there's ice! Oh, my God."
225,00:16:27.53,00:16:27.53,">> God, my hands are shaking. Here."
226,00:16:32.00,00:16:32.00,>> Can we get a couple more Sierra Mists?
227,00:16:34.87,00:16:34.87,">> Oh, my gosh. >> I cannot believe it."
228,00:16:40.17,00:16:40.17,">> We can each have a half. >> Oh, my God, they have French"
229,00:16:44.90,00:16:44.90,"baguette. >> Oh, my gosh, you guys,"
230,00:16:46.67,00:16:46.67,"this chicken is incredible. Oh, my God, have you tried the"
231,00:16:50.57,00:16:50.57,bean thing? It is so good!
232,00:16:52.80,00:16:52.80,What's in here? It's like a relish or something.
233,00:16:56.47,00:16:56.47,>> The challenge was very exciting.
234,00:16:58.17,00:16:58.17,It was a relay challenge. It was definitely a reward that
235,00:17:00.87,00:17:00.87,we needed. Not necessarily did we need the
236,00:17:03.53,00:17:03.53,"food, but we needed to keep Rotu away from the food."
237,00:17:07.23,00:17:07.23,>> I honestly have probably had 20 cookies.
238,00:17:09.23,00:17:09.23,"I kid you not. >> Me, too."
239,00:17:10.50,00:17:10.50,"We have to eat slowly, so we can eat longer."
240,00:17:12.77,00:17:12.77,">> It's so hard though. >> Oh, it's so hard."
241,00:17:14.70,00:17:14.70,">> God, I feel so bad. Why were they so grumbly?"
242,00:17:17.03,00:17:17.03,"Would we have been that grumbly? >> I got to tell you, it was"
243,00:17:20.40,00:17:20.40,"utter disbelief this morning. >> Oh, Gabe?"
244,00:17:22.93,00:17:22.93,Shocked. >> Absolutely shocked.
245,00:17:24.80,00:17:24.80,">> I mean, I was really shocked. Honestly when we were over"
246,00:17:27.00,00:17:27.00,"there, Gabe was probably the strongest member of our team"
247,00:17:29.67,00:17:29.67,"over there, he did everything. So there's got to be some big"
248,00:17:33.10,00:17:33.10,quarrelly stuff going on over there.
249,00:17:35.20,00:17:35.20,">> I mean, I think it's a consensus that we all feel like"
250,00:17:38.00,00:17:38.00,"a family here, us four, I mean, it's truly a family."
251,00:17:40.60,00:17:40.60,">> I'll tell you what, it's heaven on earth."
252,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,An old guy like me with three women?
253,00:17:44.67,00:17:44.67,Does it get any better than that?
254,00:17:47.40,00:17:47.40,No. >> I love when you say that.
255,00:17:49.57,00:17:49.57,(belching) >> That's going to make me throw
256,00:17:53.03,00:17:53.03,up. >> Gross.
257,00:17:53.67,00:17:53.67,">> I'd rather you thrown up. >> Oh, my gosh."
258,00:18:02.47,00:18:02.47,">> Three quarters of the time that we're out here, we spend"
259,00:18:05.27,00:18:05.27,"fantasizing about food. So it was a huge, huge"
260,00:18:08.07,00:18:08.07,disappointment when they said that we didn't win.
261,00:18:11.73,00:18:11.73,>> They'll probably end up with an upset stomach all that food.
262,00:18:15.47,00:18:15.47,>> I hope they puke right after they eat it.
263,00:18:17.83,00:18:17.83,">> I ran the race, I smoked everybody."
264,00:18:20.07,00:18:20.07,I did my part. I handed the key to dumb and
265,00:18:23.27,00:18:23.27,"dumber, and they proceeded to screw up the rest of the race"
266,00:18:28.13,00:18:28.13,for us. Maraamu is over there having all
267,00:18:31.80,00:18:31.80,kinds of good food. And we're over here eating
268,00:18:36.73,00:18:36.73,roots. >> It wasn't that big of a deal
269,00:18:39.03,00:18:39.03,"to me to lose that challenge. To me, it was just a meal."
270,00:18:42.80,00:18:42.80,And I avoided apologizing. Because I am in a leadership
271,00:18:46.97,00:18:46.97,"position, and I'm not going to apologize because we lost."
272,00:18:50.63,00:18:50.63,Those guys are going to just be crapping their brains out.
273,00:18:53.33,00:18:53.33,"Those four over there, they're going to be sick as dogs."
274,00:18:56.00,00:18:56.00,"The food looked great. But cucumbers, green peppers and"
275,00:19:00.57,00:19:00.57,"beans. High, high gas foods."
276,00:19:03.53,00:19:03.53,High. We would bloat up in a second.
277,00:19:07.63,00:19:07.63,A lot of that stuff I wouldn't have touched.
278,00:19:09.73,00:19:09.73,"Two hours of yum-yum would not be worth, you know, three days"
279,00:19:12.87,00:19:12.87,of ... your brains out. That one little meal don't mean
280,00:19:16.27,00:19:16.27,nothing. >> We've got 26 days left.
281,00:19:18.27,00:19:18.27,We didn't come out here to eat fried chicken and quiche.
282,00:19:21.37,00:19:21.37,>> There you go. >> We came out here to play the
283,00:19:23.00,00:19:23.00,"game and win the game, and that's what we're going to do,"
284,00:19:25.97,00:19:25.97,bottom line. >> This is the Tony Robbins
285,00:19:27.97,00:19:27.97,"crew, boy. Let's take this show on the"
286,00:19:30.87,00:19:30.87,"road. >> We have taro, we have"
287,00:19:33.57,00:19:33.57,coconut. Even though we have it every
288,00:19:35.37,00:19:35.37,"day, we keep tricking ourselves that John's cooking up something"
289,00:19:39.20,00:19:39.20,new. See what happens when you got to
290,00:19:41.67,00:19:41.67,"use your imagination? >> What I do is, I cook the"
291,00:19:44.57,00:19:44.57,"seafood first, then I pour it off the juice."
292,00:19:46.97,00:19:46.97,"I kept some little white pieces, and I put in some coconut, and"
293,00:19:51.87,00:19:51.87,then I put in the taro. >> This isn't that bad.
294,00:19:56.37,00:19:56.37,"It's not fried chicken, but it's not bad."
295,00:19:59.23,00:19:59.23,>> Great recipe. >> I'm fooled.
296,00:20:01.40,00:20:01.40,>> I still say the chicken would have been the bomb.
297,00:20:05.53,00:20:05.53,But here's the bottom line. He said maybe like you would
298,00:20:12.23,00:20:12.23,crap your pants. What else we got out here but
299,00:20:17.07,00:20:17.07,"nature and opportunity? >> ""In the jungle, insects"
300,00:20:28.43,00:20:28.43,"creeping, In the love shack,"
301,00:20:30.27,00:20:30.27,"eight friends sleeping. We've got fire, food and"

303,00:20:36.47,00:20:36.47,"And a pig pit set with spongy bait."""
304,00:20:39.83,00:20:39.83,I don't say it as good as him. >> Gabe had written Paschal a
305,00:20:44.27,00:20:44.27,poem while they were all over there at Rotu the first ten
306,00:20:48.20,00:20:48.20,days. And Paschal and Gabe bonded like
307,00:20:50.73,00:20:50.73,"father and son. Paschal doesn't have any sons,"
308,00:20:53.43,00:20:53.43,"and he has said repeatedly that, if he had a son, he would, you"
309,00:20:57.03,00:20:57.03,"know, love for him to be just like Gabe."
310,00:20:59.47,00:20:59.47,>> Can you hand this back to Paschal?
311,00:21:01.80,00:21:01.80,>> Thanks. >> That's really special.
312,00:21:05.40,00:21:05.40,">> This morning when I saw Rotu for the first time, I was"
313,00:21:08.67,00:21:08.67,"flabbergasted. And really, I was bitterly"
314,00:21:10.97,00:21:10.97,"disappointed, because I know what it was like when we were"
315,00:21:14.23,00:21:14.23,there and what Gabe offered. 23 years old.
316,00:21:17.87,00:21:17.87,"What a kid. You know, all the people over"
317,00:21:22.80,00:21:22.80,"there, I still love dearly, but it's different now."
318,00:21:26.90,00:21:26.90,"I mean, we are who we are now, and that's in the past."
319,00:21:30.57,00:21:30.57,>> Oh... It makes me so mad. He should not have been the one
320,00:21:36.57,00:21:36.57,that left. >> He was very talented.
321,00:21:38.47,00:21:38.47,"Yeah, he should not have been voted off."
322,00:21:40.67,00:21:40.67,(sniffs) >> I knew that would break his
323,00:21:51.70,00:21:51.70,heart today when we saw him gone.
324,00:22:11.73,00:22:11.73,">> I think the mood in our tribe is very relaxing, it's very"
325,00:22:15.87,00:22:15.87,peaceful. And we're at a point where we
326,00:22:18.10,00:22:18.10,can just basically hang out. >> It's all in the breathing?
327,00:22:21.67,00:22:21.67,">> Uh-huh, it's for breathing, and to just de-stress yourself."
328,00:22:25.83,00:22:25.83,>> So how long is this...? >> Chi gong.
329,00:22:28.13,00:22:28.13,>> Chi gong? >> Five minutes.
330,00:22:30.10,00:22:30.10,>> Kathy's awesome. Kathy's got a really good
331,00:22:32.43,00:22:32.43,"spirit. She's very go get 'em, and I"
332,00:22:34.43,00:22:34.43,"think she's probably a little more adventurous than I am,"
333,00:22:37.67,00:22:37.67,even. >> What does that do?
334,00:22:44.10,00:22:44.10,">> Just gets you going. >> Oh, okay."
335,00:22:46.57,00:22:46.57,">> And then you can go lay down on the couch, turn on football."
336,00:22:51.97,00:22:51.97,"Pop open a beer. >> Gina fits in, for sure."
337,00:22:54.83,00:22:54.83,"I mean, we fit in with Gina. I think at the beginning, she"
338,00:22:57.97,00:22:57.97,"was tentative, but she's definitely coming out of her"
339,00:23:00.97,00:23:00.97,"shell, so that's a positive. But I think there's a little"
340,00:23:04.27,00:23:04.27,undertow of politics in our tribe.
341,00:23:06.17,00:23:06.17,>> Have you ever felt each other's words by just putting
342,00:23:08.37,00:23:08.37,out your hands? >> Paschal's looking at us
343,00:23:11.57,00:23:11.57,"like... >> Wait, wait, you got to go"
344,00:23:13.43,00:23:13.43,slowly. Now tell me when you feel the
345,00:23:14.93,00:23:14.93,heat. I can feel it.
346,00:23:16.73,00:23:16.73,Can you feel that? You can't feel the heat?
347,00:23:18.90,00:23:18.90,"Paschal, you're numb. You're old and numb."
348,00:23:22.30,00:23:22.30,>> That's it. >> I'm definitely worried about
349,00:23:25.23,00:23:25.23,the Paschal-Neleh bond and that Gina's going to step into my
350,00:23:27.77,00:23:27.77,shoes. >> Neleh.
351,00:23:33.30,00:23:33.30,>> Yeah. >> Close your eyes.
352,00:23:35.30,00:23:35.30,Close 'em. Keep them closed.
353,00:23:39.40,00:23:39.40,I just want you to sniff. Tell me what you smell.
354,00:23:41.57,00:23:41.57,What do you smell? >> Hold on.
355,00:23:44.73,00:23:44.73,It's really sweet. >> Mm-hmm.
356,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87,>> Candy? (gasps)
357,00:23:50.50,00:23:50.50,>> It's soft. So we're going to cut it.
358,00:23:53.03,00:23:53.03,>> Yum! >> I think Gina is part of our
359,00:23:56.10,00:23:56.10,"tribe like there's no more Rotu, and we're just one big tribe"
360,00:23:59.37,00:23:59.37,together and that's how I'm just going to finish playing the
361,00:24:02.17,00:24:02.17,"game. >> Oh, man."
362,00:24:04.37,00:24:04.37,>> I can smell it from here. >> Good gracious.
363,00:24:07.20,00:24:07.20,>> I love Gina to death and I feel closer to her now than I do
364,00:24:10.10,00:24:10.10,some of my other tribe members. Good little picker!
365,00:24:23.37,00:24:23.37,">> As soon as they got Gabe kicked out, I knew there was an"
366,00:24:26.53,00:24:26.53,alliance with those four Rotu people.
367,00:24:28.53,00:24:28.53,"I just wanted to see them lie to me to my face, when I asked them"
368,00:24:31.90,00:24:31.90,if there was or not. Can I ask you a question?
369,00:24:37.00,00:24:37.00,"You, the General, Tammy and John, you guys don't have an"
370,00:24:41.07,00:24:41.07,"alliance, the four of you? >> We have a friendship, not an"
371,00:24:45.17,00:24:45.17,alliance. >> That's interesting.
372,00:24:47.10,00:24:47.10,I knew she was lying the second she told it to me.
373,00:24:50.00,00:24:50.00,I could just tell. Don't sit there and tell me that
374,00:24:55.03,00:24:55.03,I'm 100% honest and everything is 100% legit and then turn
375,00:24:58.50,00:24:58.50,around and lie to me and stab me in the back.
376,00:25:01.50,00:25:01.50,"Because, game or no game, I won't forget it."
377,00:25:04.37,00:25:04.37,You know what I'm saying? >> I understand what you're
378,00:25:08.13,00:25:08.13,saying. >> I don't trust Zoe.
379,00:25:09.87,00:25:09.87,"At this point, I don't trust anybody in the game except"
380,00:25:12.90,00:25:12.90,"myself. >> I mean, if we win tomorrow,"
381,00:25:15.00,00:25:15.00,"the game is still alive for us. What's up, man?"
382,00:25:17.63,00:25:17.63,>> Pretty much I had had it with the quiet treatment from John
383,00:25:22.53,00:25:22.53,and the rest of the four-member cast of Rotu over here and I
384,00:25:25.93,00:25:25.93,wanted to get things out in the open.
385,00:25:28.03,00:25:28.03,You're telling me straight up that you four don't have an
386,00:25:30.50,00:25:30.50,alliance? You four over here?
387,00:25:32.70,00:25:32.70,">> No, how could you say that we don't?"
388,00:25:34.47,00:25:34.47,"I mean, you'd have to be blind not to see that."
389,00:25:36.63,00:25:36.63,>> Zoe just told me straight up in my face not even five minutes
390,00:25:40.57,00:25:40.57,"ago, John. >> Maybe she's not thinking that"
391,00:25:43.13,00:25:43.13,way. >> John.
392,00:25:43.93,00:25:43.93,">> Hey, have I ... you yet? >> Do I have ""stupid"" written on"
393,00:25:46.70,00:25:46.70,"my forehead? >> I'm saying, in my mind, yes."
394,00:25:49.97,00:25:49.97,>> There's definitely an alliance.
395,00:25:51.67,00:25:51.67,">> Absolutely. >> All right, that's what I'm"
396,00:25:53.53,00:25:53.53,"saying, you're being honest right now."
397,00:25:54.97,00:25:54.97,I appreciate your honesty. >> But if we're going to talk
398,00:25:57.73,00:25:57.73,"about that, then we also have to look at, you know, when we were"
399,00:26:01.63,00:26:01.63,going to vote out Gabe. Your behavior to me completely
400,00:26:04.40,00:26:04.40,changed and you were trying to figure out maybe another
401,00:26:06.87,00:26:06.87,"scenario to take out me. >> Not you in particular, but"
402,00:26:09.70,00:26:09.70,somebody on that. >> Look me in the eye and tell
403,00:26:12.10,00:26:12.10,me it wasn't me. >> It wasn't you.
404,00:26:13.60,00:26:13.60,">> Uh, huh, yeah, right. Do I have ""stupid"" written on my"
405,00:26:16.53,00:26:16.53,forehead? But you guys are our team.
406,00:26:19.17,00:26:19.17,You're here. We have strength in numbers.
407,00:26:22.47,00:26:22.47,"If there's a traditional merge and we all merge at the end,"
408,00:26:26.43,00:26:26.43,"three of them and seven of us, those three go first."
409,00:26:30.03,00:26:30.03,That is my absolute word. Only thing is that freaks me
410,00:26:33.77,00:26:33.77,"out, I don't trust you. I don't trust you."
411,00:26:36.67,00:26:36.67,>> I promise you I won't try to like swing to the other side or
412,00:26:40.10,00:26:40.10,anything like that. I promise you I'll tell you
413,00:26:42.57,00:26:42.57,"straight up. >> I'm giving you my word 100%,"
414,00:26:44.73,00:26:44.73,we will not get over there and try get those old Rotu people to
415,00:26:48.00,00:26:48.00,"vote you out. It will not happen, okay?"
416,00:26:50.73,00:26:50.73,And don't try to ... me. Okay.
417,00:26:53.00,00:26:53.00,I'm taking your word. >> I will.
418,00:26:55.07,00:26:55.07,>> Okay. >> Same thing buddy.
419,00:26:56.70,00:26:56.70,">> I think to a degree, I may have convinced him that I'm part"
420,00:26:59.50,00:26:59.50,"of the team now. I want him to trust me, but he"
421,00:27:03.03,00:27:03.03,"shouldn't. Are you gay, dude?"
422,00:27:06.00,00:27:06.00,">> Eh, don't ask me that. >> You don't want to say that?"
423,00:27:08.57,00:27:08.57,">> Yeah, I am. It was very passive aggressive,"
424,00:27:11.30,00:27:11.30,"like a throw away comment, ""Hey, are you gay?"""
425,00:27:13.40,00:27:13.40,"But, you know, hey, I'm 36 years old."
426,00:27:15.30,00:27:15.30,"I've been out for a long time, so I said, ""Yeah, you know, I"
427,00:27:18.37,00:27:18.37,"am."" I said, thanks for outing me,"
428,00:27:20.83,00:27:20.83,you know. But this 36-year-old gay boy
429,00:27:23.47,00:27:23.47,from Omaha is running the show and just whipping his pants.
430,00:27:41.53,00:27:41.53,>> This immunity challenge is critical to me.
431,00:27:44.50,00:27:44.50,"If we don't win this challenge, then I'm probably gone tomorrow."
432,00:27:48.27,00:27:48.27,"Sean, V. and Tammy definitely have to play in today's immunity"
433,00:27:52.00,00:27:52.00,"challenge, because I sat out yesterday."
434,00:27:54.43,00:27:54.43,"I'm going to be the fourth member, I'm not going to back"
435,00:27:57.30,00:27:57.30,"down, I want to participate. If we lose and this is my last"
436,00:28:00.43,00:28:00.43,"one, at least I want to know that I gave my best."
437,00:28:02.97,00:28:02.97,Don't count me out. >> Tammy and the General and I
438,00:28:13.93,00:28:13.93,have had a couple conversations about if we were to lose the
439,00:28:17.07,00:28:17.07,"next immunity challenge, who would be the next person to go."
440,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,"I'm just saying, I mean, I'm trying to stay two steps ahead."
441,00:28:23.73,00:28:23.73,Rob is desperate to do something.
442,00:28:25.97,00:28:25.97,I think we sit in a much better place if we don't have Rob at
443,00:28:30.07,00:28:30.07,"the merge, period. He is a little bit dangerous and"
444,00:28:32.87,00:28:32.87,we have one opportunity to get rid of him.
445,00:28:34.83,00:28:34.83,My gut is screaming to me that it would be better if we
446,00:28:37.83,00:28:37.83,"actually lost this challenge and lost that voice, and that person"
447,00:28:42.70,00:28:42.70,that Rob represents that's so dangerous.
448,00:28:45.70,00:28:45.70,">> But the thing is, I'm not throwing immunity."
449,00:28:47.73,00:28:47.73,I can't go in there and not try. >> Just don't do anything extra
450,00:28:50.27,00:28:50.27,"to, like, help them if they're, like, falling behind."
451,00:28:52.13,00:28:52.13,I'm serious. We're talking a million dollars
452,00:28:53.67,00:28:53.67,is at stake here. What I was trying to say to
453,00:28:55.80,00:28:55.80,Tammy is there are certain battles that you definitely need
454,00:28:59.03,00:28:59.03,to win and there are certain battles that you don't.
455,00:29:01.97,00:29:01.97,>> I hate the fact that I'm in this challenge and you don't
456,00:29:04.47,00:29:04.47,want to win this. >> I don't know what to tell
457,00:29:06.47,00:29:06.47,"you, it's better if he's just gone."
458,00:29:08.07,00:29:08.07,">> To be completely honest, I mean, I don't know what I'm"
459,00:29:10.37,00:29:10.37,going to do when it's time to step up to the plate for today's
460,00:29:13.93,00:29:13.93,challenge. I just don't know.
461,00:29:22.83,00:29:22.83,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Welcome."
462,00:29:25.90,00:29:25.90,First things first. Immunity is back up for grabs.
463,00:29:30.57,00:29:30.57,Today's immunity challenge is a giant maze.
464,00:29:34.47,00:29:34.47,"Hidden within the maze, five rungs that each tribe will use"
465,00:29:38.07,00:29:38.07,to build a ladder. Each tribe will start next to
466,00:29:40.60,00:29:40.60,each other. You'll head in opposite
467,00:29:42.23,00:29:42.23,directions to find the first rung.
468,00:29:43.87,00:29:43.87,First tribe to collect all five rungs in order from one through
469,00:29:47.53,00:29:47.53,"five, build the ladder from top to bottom, get to the top of the"
470,00:29:51.77,00:29:51.77,"ladder, one person with your flag, wins immunity."
471,00:29:56.07,00:29:56.07,"To make it interesting, you'll be tied together during the"
472,00:29:58.87,00:29:58.87,"process. At stake, the vote."
473,00:30:01.13,00:30:01.13,"Win tonight, guaranteed one in ten shot of being the sole"
474,00:30:04.37,00:30:04.37,"survivor. Lose, your tribe goes to Tribal"
475,00:30:06.87,00:30:06.87,"Council, another person voted out of the tribe."
476,00:30:09.87,00:30:09.87,"Rotu, because you have three extra, you'll sit three out."
477,00:30:12.47,00:30:12.47,Pick your four. We'll get you tied up.
478,00:30:15.10,00:30:15.10,Kathy is leading Maraamu Rob is leading Rotu.
479,00:30:18.13,00:30:18.13,"John, General, Zoe, you're sitting out."
480,00:30:25.53,00:30:25.53,Survivors ready! Go!
481,00:30:38.87,00:30:38.87,">> Left, left, left, left. >> More?"
482,00:30:42.70,00:30:42.70,">> Remember that. Ready, left."
483,00:30:45.13,00:30:45.13,We're going left. Go left.
484,00:30:47.00,00:30:47.00,">> Let's pick it up. >> Left, left, left."
485,00:30:49.10,00:30:49.10,">> Okay, turn around. >> Okay."
486,00:30:51.00,00:30:51.00,">> Remember that. >> Come on, we've got to move"
487,00:30:54.03,00:30:54.03,"faster. >> Right, go right."
488,00:30:55.37,00:30:55.37,">> There's something over here. >> Okay, what's this?"
489,00:30:57.70,00:30:57.70,">> Yellow. >> Yellow, but what number?"
490,00:30:59.23,00:30:59.23,>> Two. >> Two.
491,00:31:00.57,00:31:00.57,Two dots. >> Keep going.
492,00:31:04.43,00:31:04.43,">> Yes! Hurry, hurry."
493,00:31:05.77,00:31:05.77,"Hurry up, guys. Hurry up."
494,00:31:10.07,00:31:10.07,">> Come on, we got to move faster."
495,00:31:12.77,00:31:12.77,Okay. Number 4. There's a ton of blue over here.
496,00:31:17.77,00:31:17.77,"Inside, inside. >> PROBST: Rotu takes an early"
497,00:31:23.70,00:31:23.70,lead. >> I want to get to the other
498,00:31:25.77,00:31:25.77,"side, you guys. >> Okay, we're right behind you."
499,00:31:28.00,00:31:28.00,">> I know, I just want to tell what you I'm doing."
500,00:31:30.07,00:31:30.07,">> Right there, go left. Go left, Rob."
501,00:31:33.93,00:31:33.93,>> Okay. >> Yes!
502,00:31:35.00,00:31:35.00,">> Hurry up, quick. >> Okay, we need three."
503,00:31:43.80,00:31:43.80,">> Way to go, Rob, way to go! >> PROBST: Big circular maze,"
504,00:31:46.97,00:31:46.97,"guys. >> Way to go, Rotu."
505,00:31:55.07,00:31:55.07,"You're doing great. >> Yes, yes, yes, yes."
506,00:31:56.80,00:31:56.80,">> Hurry up, hurry up. Hurry up, guys."
507,00:32:00.57,00:32:00.57,">> Okay, we got one. Let me go."
508,00:32:04.53,00:32:04.53,"Three is going to be over here. Here we go, back here."
509,00:32:14.73,00:32:14.73,"Wait a minute, I got to get my bearings."
510,00:32:17.13,00:32:17.13,"To get back in the center, I think we have to go around"
511,00:32:19.83,00:32:19.83,this way. >> PROBST: Rotu has three.
512,00:32:28.83,00:32:28.83,>> Here we go. Come on.
513,00:32:34.73,00:32:34.73,">> Back this way. >> PROBST: Maraamu, finally on"
514,00:32:38.47,00:32:38.47,"the board. >> Okay, guys, help me get back."
515,00:32:42.60,00:32:42.60,"Okay, help me get back. >> Hurry up!"
516,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,>> Okay. >> Go. Go.

519,00:32:56.23,00:32:56.23,"Left, right, left, right. >> Kathy, the other way."
520,00:32:58.90,00:32:58.90,">> What? >> Go back the other way, honey."
521,00:33:00.87,00:33:00.87,">> That was four, that wasn't three."
522,00:33:03.43,00:33:03.43,Why can't we get around this thing?
523,00:33:06.13,00:33:06.13,Come on. We've got to get to the outer
524,00:33:09.47,00:33:09.47,"rim. We can't, that dead ends?"
525,00:33:11.07,00:33:11.07,">> Go this way, go to the right. >> This way, Kathy, this way."
526,00:33:14.47,00:33:14.47,>> That's not it. >> We've been that way a hundred
527,00:33:16.00,00:33:16.00,"times. >> No, we've got to get over"
528,00:33:23.17,00:33:23.17,"there. See, over there?"
529,00:33:24.13,00:33:24.13,">> Let's move, let's move. Okay."
530,00:33:26.63,00:33:26.63,"Left, right, left, right. >> PROBST: Rotu has four,"

532,00:33:36.67,00:33:36.67,"one. >> Let's go, let's go."
533,00:33:44.53,00:33:44.53,">> You guys, we got to move faster."
534,00:33:46.53,00:33:46.53,"Nothing. >> Double-time, baby."
535,00:33:49.97,00:33:49.97,>> Double-time. >> Come on.
536,00:33:52.20,00:33:52.20,>> Go. (shouting)
537,00:34:03.03,00:34:03.03,">> PROBST: Rotu wins! >> You guys, slow down."
538,00:34:15.67,00:34:15.67,>> This is it. >> This is what it's all about.
539,00:34:21.73,00:34:21.73,">> PROBST: Maraamu, I'm sorry to say, Tribal Council tomorrow"
540,00:34:24.40,00:34:24.40,"night with me, one of the four of you is going home."
541,00:34:57.50,00:34:57.50,>> How was your day? >> Good.
542,00:34:59.47,00:34:59.47,I got troca and cowrie. >> Are you serious?
543,00:35:02.70,00:35:02.70,Lots? >> Four troca and I think
544,00:35:05.23,00:35:05.23,five... >> Good job.
545,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,">> When we got back there wasn't fire, so I was feeling pretty"
546,00:35:11.37,00:35:11.37,"bad. You know, I did not do a good"
547,00:35:13.07,00:35:13.07,"leadership role in the maze, and we got back and I drowned out"
548,00:35:16.30,00:35:16.30,the fire. >> You got to take the sand out.
549,00:35:23.07,00:35:23.07,>> I lit it this morning without taking the sand out.
550,00:35:25.97,00:35:25.97,>> Gina and I sort of go back and forth about putting sand on
551,00:35:28.90,00:35:28.90,the fire. I always put sand on the fire
552,00:35:30.63,00:35:30.63,at Rotu and it worked like a charm.
553,00:35:32.17,00:35:32.17,Maybe the sand was different over there.
554,00:35:33.70,00:35:33.70,">> We're low on firewood, so we just... I beefed it up, got a"
555,00:35:38.43,00:35:38.43,coal bed and covered it. >> The sand just puts it out if
556,00:35:42.53,00:35:42.53,it touches it. >> What about piling as many
557,00:35:45.13,00:35:45.13,hot coals together? >> These aren't hot.
558,00:35:47.87,00:35:47.87,>> Some of them are hot to touch when I was digging them out.
559,00:35:49.90,00:35:49.90,>> They're not anymore. >> She said at Rotu they put
560,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17,"sand on their fire to keep the coals hot, and I know whenever I"
561,00:35:56.50,00:35:56.50,go camping we put sand on the fire to put it out.
562,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57,">> As much as we were burning, we just didn't burn enough of a"
563,00:36:02.57,00:36:02.57,"bed today. >> You don't have to, I mean..."
564,00:36:07.03,00:36:07.03,I don't think that's going to light.
565,00:36:09.47,00:36:09.47,>> We just don't have fire. >> I was hoping that we would go
566,00:36:14.63,00:36:14.63,to Tribal Council and vote tonight after having a
567,00:36:17.43,00:36:17.43,conversation. But I went to talk to Gina about
568,00:36:20.20,00:36:20.20,it and she felt that we shouldn't talk about it.
569,00:36:23.20,00:36:23.20,So I'm not going to bring it up. >> These guys do not like to
570,00:36:27.97,00:36:27.97,"break through this. >> No, they don't."
571,00:36:30.77,00:36:30.77,>> I don't think they have enough guts right now to talk
572,00:36:34.00,00:36:34.00,"about it. I totally disagree with that, I"
573,00:36:36.03,00:36:36.03,"think we should just own up to it, man, just put it on the"
574,00:36:38.80,00:36:38.80,table and figure it out and enjoy the rest of the day.
575,00:36:41.40,00:36:41.40,>> We are out of fire. >> Out of fire?
576,00:36:45.63,00:36:45.63,>> No fire. >> At all? For sure?
577,00:36:49.07,00:36:49.07,"We know that one of us is going to have to go, and it's a hard"
578,00:36:53.87,00:36:53.87,decision. I don't think they're going to
579,00:36:56.10,00:36:56.10,vote for me just because I wasn't with them originally.
580,00:36:58.83,00:36:58.83,"And I might be wrong, but I don't feel that way."
581,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,I just don't like that sand idea she uses.
582,00:37:05.77,00:37:05.77,"That's how you put out fires. >> That's what I thought, too."
583,00:37:09.37,00:37:09.37,">> If I work at strategizing for myself, I'd have to vote on"
584,00:37:13.50,00:37:13.50,"Kathy, because I automatically know that Neleh nor Paschal are"
585,00:37:17.77,00:37:17.77,going to vote on each other. Have you eaten those raw before?
586,00:37:22.73,00:37:22.73,>> Hmm-mm. >> You need lemon.
587,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,>> They're hard as a rock. >> I'm not going to start
588,00:37:28.57,00:37:28.57,"tonight either. >> Honestly, I haven't decide"
589,00:37:31.10,00:37:31.10,what I'm going to do. I've been back and forth all
590,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,day. I definitely know I'm not going
591,00:37:36.17,00:37:36.17,"to vote Paschal, but between Kathy and Gina, I'm having a"
592,00:37:39.20,00:37:39.20,"really tough time. >> Look, on the other side, we"
593,00:37:40.97,00:37:40.97,went to bed many a night without anything.
594,00:37:46.50,00:37:46.50,>> We're going to go to Tribal Council tonight and each member
595,00:37:49.43,00:37:49.43,is going to get up and vote and it will be a secret until that
596,00:37:52.43,00:37:52.43,"very moment. >> PROBST: Okay, let's get right"
597,00:38:21.50,00:38:21.50,to it. A lot has happened.
598,00:38:22.87,00:38:22.87,"This small little tribe of four, the true underdogs, has come on"
599,00:38:27.10,00:38:27.10,"very strong. Paschal, what kind of tribe is"
600,00:38:29.70,00:38:29.70,this? How different are things now
601,00:38:31.50,00:38:31.50,from the last time you guys were here?
602,00:38:33.53,00:38:33.53,>> If you would have told me when I left Rotu that we were
603,00:38:36.70,00:38:36.70,"going to duplicate what we had at Rotu, I'd say there's no way."
604,00:38:40.20,00:38:40.20,"Not only have we duplicated it, we have surpassed it."
605,00:38:43.17,00:38:43.17,>> PROBST: Really. So let's talk about loyalties
606,00:38:45.97,00:38:45.97,"then. Kathy, where are your loyalties"
607,00:38:48.57,00:38:48.57,now? >> I think there's a spirit of
608,00:38:50.50,00:38:50.50,Rotu still lurking about over on the other beach.
609,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,"But it's diminished, and we've really formed something here"
610,00:38:56.47,00:38:56.47,that's united. I think both tribes have
611,00:38:58.77,00:38:58.77,dissipated and we're creating something new.
612,00:39:01.53,00:39:01.53,">> PROBST: If you merged tonight, would the four of you"
613,00:39:04.03,00:39:04.03,"go in together or would it be hey, Gina, really been fun,"
614,00:39:06.87,00:39:06.87,we're going to see if we can infiltrate back into the
615,00:39:09.77,00:39:09.77,"strength of the numbers of Rotu? >> No, we would go as the four"
616,00:39:13.77,00:39:13.77,"of us, strong. >> Absolutely, four of us."
617,00:39:16.87,00:39:16.87,>> PROBST: Neleh. >> Absolutely.
618,00:39:19.17,00:39:19.17,">> PROBST: How about you, Gina? Are you still a black sheep or"
619,00:39:22.03,00:39:22.03,are you truly now a tribe of four?
620,00:39:23.60,00:39:23.60,>> We're definitely a tribe. I would definitely call it even
621,00:39:26.53,00:39:26.53,like a family. We don't want to vote anybody
622,00:39:28.73,00:39:28.73,"off tonight. >> PROBST: Kathy, let's talk"
623,00:39:30.50,00:39:30.50,about the immunity challenge yesterday.
624,00:39:32.07,00:39:32.07,You were dragging these guys like they were school kids who
625,00:39:34.40,00:39:34.40,"didn't want to get up. At any point, did you think,"
626,00:39:36.87,00:39:36.87,"yikes, I hope we're still a tribe here and I hope they're"
627,00:39:40.03,00:39:40.03,not going to make me a scapegoat?
628,00:39:41.87,00:39:41.87,>> My head hung low because I felt that I failed the tribe on
629,00:39:44.83,00:39:44.83,the challenge. But the other thing is that
630,00:39:46.93,00:39:46.93,"there's such a family feeling between the four of us, that I"
631,00:39:50.00,00:39:50.00,felt okay once we got outside the maze and we got back to
632,00:39:55.40,00:39:55.40,camp. >> PROBST: So if you guys are
633,00:39:57.03,00:39:57.03,"such a tight family, how are you going to vote tonight?"
634,00:39:59.23,00:39:59.23,How do you make that decision? Neleh?
635,00:40:01.80,00:40:01.80,">> Every ten minutes, I probably am thinking someone different."
636,00:40:04.47,00:40:04.47,"That's how many times it's gone through my head today, because I"
637,00:40:07.93,00:40:07.93,do not want anybody to go. >> PROBST: Have you made your
638,00:40:10.73,00:40:10.73,decision now? >> Honestly I haven't.
639,00:40:13.53,00:40:13.53,>> PROBST: Okay. It's time to vote.
640,00:40:15.23,00:40:15.23,"Paschal, you're first. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the"
641,00:41:06.77,00:41:06.77,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
642,00:41:23.63,00:41:23.63,"decision is final, the person will be asked to leave the"
643,00:41:26.03,00:41:26.03,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
644,00:41:34.70,00:41:34.70,Gina. Kathy.
645,00:41:44.40,00:41:44.40,"Gina. Two votes Gina, one vote Kathy."
646,00:41:52.07,00:41:52.07,Deciding vote... Gina.
647,00:41:56.17,00:41:56.17,You need to bring me your torch. >> Love you.
648,00:41:59.43,00:41:59.43,">> I love you. >> PROBST: Gina, the tribe has"
649,00:42:06.50,00:42:06.50,spoken. It's time for you to go.
650,00:42:22.53,00:42:22.53,"Well, you guys kept insisting on using the word ""family"" tonight"
651,00:42:26.30,00:42:26.30,"instead of tribe. Sometimes, families have to make"
652,00:42:29.33,00:42:29.33,hard decisions. I'm sure this has been one of
653,00:42:31.63,00:42:31.63,the hardest. You guys can head back to camp.
654,00:42:33.13,00:42:33.13,I'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned for scenes
655,00:42:47.63,00:42:47.63,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
656,00:42:53.17,00:42:53.17, Survivor... The two tribes merge into one.
657,00:42:55.10,00:42:55.10,">> It's so good to see you. >> Our Heavenly Father, we're so"
658,00:42:57.80,00:42:57.80,grateful for each other and for the bonds that we have together.
659,00:42:59.83,00:42:59.83,>> Amen. >> PROBST: But can they all live
660,00:43:02.13,00:43:02.13,"happily under one roof? >> Tell the truth for once, will"
661,00:43:04.37,00:43:04.37,you? >> Zoe's lying to me.
662,00:43:05.50,00:43:05.50,They're all lying to me. >> Nobody in this game knows
663,00:43:07.97,00:43:07.97,who's telling the truth. >> Don't lie to my face.
664,00:43:09.80,00:43:09.80,">> Now it's on, man. >> Miss Kathy, Paschal and"
665,00:43:18.83,00:43:18.83,"Neleh, you're awesome. I love you guys."
666,00:43:21.10,00:43:21.10,I understand the vote tonight. The tribal members that are
667,00:43:23.93,00:43:23.93,"left, the tribe mates, I hope you play well, play good, play"
668,00:43:27.80,00:43:27.80,hard. I just have to say that I've had
669,00:43:30.00,00:43:30.00,"the time of my life, and it's been a wonderful, wonderful"
670,00:43:33.10,00:43:33.10,"time. Nothing will ever, ever replace"
671,00:43:34.47,00:43:34.47,this experience. Thanks.
