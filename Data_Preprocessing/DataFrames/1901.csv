258,00:13:58.88,00:13:58.88,>> That's right. >> PROBST: You are definitely
259,00:14:00.96,00:14:00.96,the underdogs. Here's your map to your new

261,00:14:05.83,00:14:05.83,Head out. You've got a camp to build.

269,00:14:40.21,00:14:40.21,">> What do we do now? >> Well, does anybody have any,"
270,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,"like, practical, real world experience?"
271,00:14:45.88,00:14:45.88,">> I'm a hillbilly, man. >> Really?"
272,00:14:48.12,00:14:48.12,>> I've done this lots of times. The bathroom should definitely
273,00:14:51.08,00:14:51.08,not be up from camp. It should be away.
274,00:14:53.92,00:14:53.92,">> Ben's an interesting cat. You know, he shows up to camp"
275,00:14:57.29,00:14:57.29,"and, I mean, the guy is just, like, ""All eyes to me."""
276,00:14:59.88,00:14:59.88,">> We just need four holes that are, like, equidistant apart,"
277,00:15:01.88,00:15:01.88,"like... >> I can dig, I can dig holes."

279,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,>> I think the leadership thing is difficult and I'm still
280,00:15:08.50,00:15:08.50,trying to sort out exactly how to run it.
281,00:15:11.25,00:15:11.25,>> Put that other piece of bamboo that way.
282,00:15:13.12,00:15:13.12,">> If he wants to step up and take control of things, you know"
283,00:15:15.79,00:15:15.79,"what? Have at it, my friend, because"
284,00:15:18.29,00:15:18.29,"he'll paint his own target. >> I didn't come here to work, I"
285,00:15:25.29,00:15:25.29,came here to play. You got to talk about alliance
286,00:15:28.88,00:15:28.88,"as soon as you step on this island, so my strategy is to be"
287,00:15:33.42,00:15:33.42,able to have a secret alliance with each one of these dumb
288,00:15:36.12,00:15:36.12,girls. We can have something like a
289,00:15:38.58,00:15:38.58,secret alliance. >> Okay.
290,00:15:42.83,00:15:42.83,>> Hmm? >> So we can be strong from the
291,00:15:45.67,00:15:45.67,beginning. We can look back at this moment
292,00:15:49.21,00:15:49.21,right now... (Ashley laughs)
293,00:15:50.96,00:15:50.96,"...and say, ""We did it from the beginning, from day one."""
294,00:15:53.08,00:15:53.08,>> Right. >> It is day one now.
295,00:15:55.25,00:15:55.25,"I've got an alliance with the dumb, short-haired blonde."
296,00:15:57.12,00:15:57.12,>> This is what I wanted. >> Pinky swear?
297,00:15:58.46,00:15:58.46,>> I wanted someone to approach me.
298,00:16:00.92,00:16:00.92,>> And the even dumber long- haired blonde.
299,00:16:03.00,00:16:03.00,>> I'll trust you. So do I have that same trust
300,00:16:04.71,00:16:04.71,with you? >> Yes.
301,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,>> And the dark-haired girl... >> You've got my word.
302,00:16:08.29,00:16:08.29,>> You have mine. >> I like to call it my dumb-
303,00:16:10.75,00:16:10.75,ass girl alliance. It's just gonna be me and you.
304,00:16:13.12,00:16:13.12,>> All right. >> I told them exactly the same
305,00:16:15.04,00:16:15.04,thing. This is real.
306,00:16:17.04,00:16:17.04,>> I believe you. >> Not joking.
307,00:16:19.50,00:16:19.50,And I believe they're just gullible enough to believe it.
308,00:16:22.50,00:16:22.50,I know this ... before I even got here.
309,00:16:24.62,00:16:24.62,Align with the old lady. (Betsy laughs)
310,00:16:27.33,00:16:27.33,>> You suck. >> To make sure that I win this
311,00:16:30.79,00:16:30.79,"game, my fourth alliance is with the old lady."
312,00:16:33.67,00:16:33.67,"I know she's a lot smarter than my dumb-ass girl alliance, so"
313,00:16:37.75,00:16:37.75,I've got to be real careful with that one.
314,00:16:39.33,00:16:39.33,>> Should we shake? Should we let people see us
315,00:16:41.17,00:16:41.17,"shake or what? That is fun, Russell."
316,00:16:44.88,00:16:44.88,"As a police officer, I usually can get a pretty good read on"
317,00:16:47.67,00:16:47.67,"somebody by talking to them, looking in their eyes, their"
318,00:16:50.96,00:16:50.96,body language. I just have a feeling that I
319,00:16:54.00,00:16:54.00,don't trust Russell because he came to me too quick in the
320,00:16:56.33,00:16:56.33,"game. I did make an alliance with him,"
321,00:17:01.04,00:17:01.04,but I don't trust him. >> Galu!
322,00:17:14.83,00:17:14.83,"Welcome home, guys! (cheering and applause)"
323,00:17:17.12,00:17:17.12,">> Home, sweet home. >> Oh, my God."
324,00:17:19.54,00:17:19.54,"So, listen to this. Let's make our structure."
325,00:17:21.83,00:17:21.83,I've been elected leader of the Galu tribe.
326,00:17:25.38,00:17:25.38,"It is a heavy, heavy liability. Who's the one that you always"
327,00:17:29.25,00:17:29.25,want to get when you don't know who you want to get?
328,00:17:32.46,00:17:32.46,Get the leader. This is almost like we're
329,00:17:34.67,00:17:34.67,"building a raft. Let's think about a raft, right,"
330,00:17:38.00,00:17:38.00,"on the ground, right, and then we're going to raise the raft"
331,00:17:41.42,00:17:41.42,up. >> That sounds great.
332,00:17:43.25,00:17:43.25,">> So, make sense? Let's get it done."
333,00:17:45.75,00:17:45.75,">> When we first landed on the beach, I saw Russell, our tribe"
334,00:17:49.71,00:17:49.71,"leader, begin to actually take charge."
335,00:17:52.54,00:17:52.54,"It was really cool. I felt, ""Yay, we do have a"
336,00:17:56.04,00:17:56.04,"leader."" >> I just want to do some"
337,00:17:58.21,00:17:58.21,building. >> Ow.
338,00:18:02.92,00:18:02.92,>> You're going to make this load bearing?
339,00:18:04.79,00:18:04.79,"The tree isn't vertical, so it isn't compressed through the"
340,00:18:07.42,00:18:07.42,"core. >> Oh, my God."
341,00:18:09.04,00:18:09.04,They're still discussing it. My only problem right now is we
342,00:18:13.00,00:18:13.00,"have some really strong, male, dominant personalities that"
343,00:18:16.04,00:18:16.04,"aren't hearing one another. >> I mean, can we go higher than"
344,00:18:18.04,00:18:18.04,this potentially? I mean...
345,00:18:19.21,00:18:19.21,">> Yeah, there is no limitation. >> This isn't necessarily like a"
346,00:18:20.92,00:18:20.92,"hard stop line... >> No, no."
347,00:18:22.08,00:18:22.08,>> There's no reason we couldn't...
348,00:18:23.92,00:18:23.92,">> Yeah, exactly. I'm just sweeping this..."
349,00:18:25.12,00:18:25.12,">> ...go up here and then two stacks, like five and then five."
350,00:18:28.29,00:18:28.29,">> They got all hung up on exactly what should be done,"
351,00:18:32.04,00:18:32.04,"how, when, where. >> If we're going to sleep here,"
352,00:18:34.96,00:18:34.96,"right, and then build a trench... and all the drain--"
353,00:18:38.04,00:18:38.04,"all the water that runs off this hill, which was part of the"
354,00:18:41.21,00:18:41.21,"initial rationale for picking this spot, right, gets diverted"
355,00:18:43.21,00:18:43.21,"around us. In my life experience, a little"
356,00:18:47.04,00:18:47.04,bit of planning has taught me don't always be so quick to
357,00:18:51.42,00:18:51.42,start spinning the wheels. Raw destruction.
358,00:18:53.42,00:18:53.42,Everyone's in a hurry right now. >> I know.
359,00:18:55.17,00:18:55.17,>> We've got all day. This isn't your typical
360,00:18:57.04,00:18:57.04,construction job. You can't push your schedule to
361,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,"the right, come in late, and deliver over budget, because"
362,00:19:02.38,00:19:02.38,guess what. Your budget is coconuts.
363,00:19:04.92,00:19:04.92,>> Should we start...? >> I think we-- it might be
364,00:19:07.17,00:19:07.17,"suited to take, like, a five- minute break and just really"
365,00:19:09.08,00:19:09.08,think about what we're doing here.
366,00:19:11.04,00:19:11.04,">> Oh, my God, these guys are killing me."
367,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,"John is very much all talk, no business."
368,00:19:15.83,00:19:15.83,I think he's an engineer or something.
369,00:19:17.88,00:19:17.88,"He's, he's too technical. >> I think wind needs to be"
370,00:19:22.42,00:19:22.42,addressed. I think rain is your biggest
371,00:19:25.04,00:19:25.04,adversary. >> All he's doing is running
372,00:19:27.04,00:19:27.04,"his mouth. >> I'm trying to kind of get an,"
373,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,get an inventory of all the actions that we need to have
374,00:19:32.17,00:19:32.17,completed or at least try. >> I think we ought to just act
375,00:19:35.25,00:19:35.25,and quit freaking thinking. >> Okay.
376,00:19:37.79,00:19:37.79,">> Ooh, Lord have mercy. >> I'm tired."
377,00:19:41.21,00:19:41.21,">> I'm going to go get wet. >> Yeah, yeah, let's go."
378,00:19:45.83,00:19:45.83,">> Yeah, because I'm vile. (laughter)"
379,00:19:52.96,00:19:52.96,">> Oh, these young kids. I didn't want to go in the damn"
380,00:19:55.79,00:19:55.79,"water. It's crazy, because I have to"
381,00:20:00.04,00:20:00.04,"constantly remind myself, this is not the Marine Corps, and all"
382,00:20:03.88,00:20:03.88,"these people are in their mid- 20s, so the way that the rest of"
383,00:20:07.62,00:20:07.62,the tribe does things is going to be way different than the way
384,00:20:10.12,00:20:10.12,that I do things. So Russell as leader-- I-I'm
385,00:20:14.08,00:20:14.08,struggling with it. He's not being assertive.
386,00:20:16.21,00:20:16.21,"He's not leading right now, in my opinion."
387,00:20:19.08,00:20:19.08,He needs to open a can of whoop- ass and lay some laws down.
388,00:20:21.08,00:20:21.08,That's what I would have done. That would have been my game
389,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,"plan. >> I lived in New Orleans, in"
390,00:20:35.46,00:20:35.46,"St. Bernard Parish, right by the levee."
391,00:20:37.92,00:20:37.92,"The storm was a category 5. When it hit, it broke the levee."
392,00:20:41.12,00:20:41.12,I was in my house. Me-- I have a German shepherd.
393,00:20:44.25,00:20:44.25,His name was Rocky. And I tried to get out of the
394,00:20:48.25,00:20:48.25,"house, and I realized I wasn't going to make it."
395,00:20:51.21,00:20:51.21,"So I grabbed my ax, because as a fireman, one thing you learn is"
396,00:20:55.17,00:20:55.17,"when you go in something, you have to be able to get out."
397,00:20:58.08,00:20:58.08,"By the time I got upstairs, the water was rushing in, like..."
398,00:21:01.83,00:21:01.83,">> Oh, my God. >> I look at Rocky."
399,00:21:03.83,00:21:03.83,"You know, I couldn't even see him."
400,00:21:05.75,00:21:05.75,It was muddy water. He was gone.
401,00:21:07.17,00:21:07.17,"I can't even find him. >> Oh, my God."
402,00:21:08.46,00:21:08.46,">> Oh, my God, oh. >> So sad."
403,00:21:13.04,00:21:13.04,>> I never lived in New Orleans and I'm not a fireman.
404,00:21:16.79,00:21:16.79,I never even had a German shepherd.
405,00:21:20.08,00:21:20.08,"You know, I really ain't got that close to another dog yet."
406,00:21:23.21,00:21:23.21,"I had him for, like, nine years. >> Really?"
407,00:21:25.96,00:21:25.96,"I'm such an animal lover. That was so hard for me to hear,"
408,00:21:29.29,00:21:29.29,"and, I don't know, it just kind of gets to you."
409,00:21:33.58,00:21:33.58,">> And when I got on the roof, I stayed there for two days."
410,00:21:36.88,00:21:36.88,>> Really? >> Two days.
411,00:21:38.88,00:21:38.88,And it's crazy how you can break their hearts by telling them a
412,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,lie. >> Russell is an interesting
413,00:21:48.21,00:21:48.21,"character because I really trusted him off the start, but"
414,00:21:51.96,00:21:51.96,"he's really been scrambling with everyone, and he was trying to"
415,00:21:55.25,00:21:55.25,"get people's sympathy about Katrina, which is probably very"
416,00:21:59.12,00:21:59.12,"true, and his dog, and I don't want to diminish that story, but"
417,00:22:03.04,00:22:03.04,"I just think that it was-- he was angling at stuff, and I'm"
418,00:22:05.62,00:22:05.62,starting to feel like he's pretty slimy.
419,00:22:14.25,00:22:14.25,>> I figure I'll make it a little interesting for
420,00:22:17.21,00:22:17.21,everybody when they wake up. I emptied all the water out of
421,00:22:19.67,00:22:19.67,all the canteens. I plan on weeding out the weak
422,00:22:24.21,00:22:24.21,right off the bat. I plan on making it as
423,00:22:30.04,00:22:30.04,miserable as possible for everybody.
424,00:22:36.58,00:22:36.58,"Little stuff like taking a sock, I done burn it in the fire."
425,00:22:41.62,00:22:41.62,"I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how"
426,00:22:46.50,00:22:46.50,they think. I'm really a multi-millionaire.
427,00:22:50.29,00:22:50.29,I own an oil company in Houston. I'm not here for the money.
428,00:22:54.25,00:22:54.25,I'm only here to show people how easy it is to win this game.
429,00:22:58.62,00:22:58.62,Another accomplishment complete. I'm the worst one to trust out
430,00:23:04.04,00:23:04.04,here. I should be the first one to go.
431,00:23:07.75,00:23:07.75,But I'm going to do everything it takes to win this game.
432,00:23:26.33,00:23:26.33,>> There's no more water. >> None whatsoever?
433,00:23:28.17,00:23:28.17,">> No. >> Yeah, they're all empty."
434,00:23:32.21,00:23:32.21,">> Oh, you know, I haven't been drinking."
435,00:23:34.38,00:23:34.38,>> Somebody drank my whole canteen.
436,00:23:36.92,00:23:36.92,>> Really? >> Yeah.
437,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,">> I'm looking for my socks, which I can't seem to find."
438,00:23:47.96,00:23:47.96,"Gone, disappeared. Me feet are starting to hurt."
439,00:23:50.92,00:23:50.92,"They're a little blistered, and I'd really like to find some"
440,00:23:54.46,00:23:54.46,"socks and to be warm, finally. >> I don't mean to be, like,"
441,00:24:02.21,00:24:02.21,"pressing, but we have to hurry. Because we have to fill the"
442,00:24:04.46,00:24:04.46,"canteens, cook some crab up. >> Will you just relax?"
443,00:24:06.38,00:24:06.38,">> No, I don't want to relax. >> It's way too hot to touch."
444,00:24:09.58,00:24:09.58,>> it's not that hot. We can start pouring it.
445,00:24:12.67,00:24:12.67,With the coconut husk? >> Here.
446,00:24:16.17,00:24:16.17,">> I'll do everything. >> No, Liz, Liz, you want to"
447,00:24:19.38,00:24:19.38,fill the canteen. >> It's hot.
448,00:24:21.17,00:24:21.17,We can blow on it. >> You can blow on it and in a
449,00:24:23.17,00:24:23.17,smaller portion it will cool it faster.
450,00:24:25.08,00:24:25.08,Use a little common sense. >> My strategy is working like
451,00:24:29.00,00:24:29.00,a dream. >> We have not had sleep.
452,00:24:32.04,00:24:32.04,Just... >> I slept fine.
453,00:24:34.62,00:24:34.62,>> Congratulations. >> And they're hollering at
454,00:24:37.79,00:24:37.79,each other right now. And I'm going to just sit back
455,00:24:41.04,00:24:41.04,"and watch them, you know, watch it happen."
456,00:24:43.92,00:24:43.92,>> I just need to keep some serenity.
457,00:24:47.62,00:24:47.62,">> I'll leave you alone. Right now, I think I am running"
458,00:24:52.42,00:24:52.42,"the whole show. They don't even know it, but I"
459,00:24:55.83,00:24:55.83,"know I am. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
460,00:25:21.08,00:25:21.08,How you guys doing? >> Good.
461,00:25:22.83,00:25:22.83,>> Good. >> Great.

464,00:25:28.29,00:25:28.29,Everybody's pulling their weight.
465,00:25:30.33,00:25:30.33,"Everybody tough as nails. >> Jeff, I've never read that"

468,00:25:38.62,00:25:38.62,"Can we start this, Jeff, because I'm ready to open some"
469,00:25:41.29,00:25:41.29,cans of whoop-ass. (laughing)

565,00:31:32.71,00:31:32.71,">> Well, weakest-wise, I think it's Ashley, just based purely"
566,00:31:37.71,00:31:37.71,"on physical strength. >> Yeah, I second Ashley."
567,00:31:42.17,00:31:42.17,">> I'm 62. I'm the oldest one out here and,"
568,00:31:44.67,00:31:44.67,"you know, I do not want to be the first one out, you know, so"
569,00:31:50.38,00:31:50.38,I'm talking to a few people and saying that I think right now we
570,00:31:53.21,00:31:53.21,should work on strength. Ashley.
571,00:31:57.67,00:31:57.67,"I'm going based on strength, weakest."
572,00:32:01.96,00:32:01.96,"There's going to be hard challenges ahead of us, so I"
573,00:32:05.00,00:32:05.00,"think we should vote off the weakest, and I am not the"
574,00:32:08.21,00:32:08.21,"physically weakest. >> Okay, but... but you've been,"
575,00:32:20.92,00:32:20.92,"like, talking to everybody. >> I know."
576,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,">> So I don't know why you've been doing that, and it makes me"
577,00:32:26.46,00:32:26.46,a little wary. >> Does it?
578,00:32:31.25,00:32:31.25,">> It makes me wary, yeah, because I've seen you talking"
579,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,"individually, like, to everyone. >> So you think..."
580,00:32:36.92,00:32:36.92,">> I'm just not sure... >> If I'm talking individually,"
581,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,it doesn't mean I'm trying to be strategizing with them.
582,00:32:43.25,00:32:43.25,>> I'd rather keep it pretty low-key.
583,00:32:45.29,00:32:45.29,"I mean, what have you been talking about?"
584,00:32:47.04,00:32:47.04,>> Everything. We're out here on Survivor.
585,00:32:50.17,00:32:50.17,"Talking about having a good time, talking to some of them"
586,00:32:53.08,00:32:53.08,about what they think and who they think the weakest...
587,00:32:57.42,00:32:57.42,How do you come to me and threaten me and telling me
588,00:33:01.42,00:33:01.42,you're feeling uncomfortable. Are you kidding me?
589,00:33:04.75,00:33:04.75,Marisa is the dumbest player I've ever seen.
590,00:33:07.75,00:33:07.75,">> It is a game, you know. >> Yeah."
591,00:33:10.08,00:33:10.08,I'm running the show here. You come up to me and threaten
592,00:33:12.75,00:33:12.75,"me, you got to go, and she's gone."
593,00:33:16.42,00:33:16.42,"She just completely threatened me, saying, ""You're not making"

598,00:33:32.62,00:33:32.62,">> Marisa. >> No, you think so?"
599,00:33:36.17,00:33:36.17,>> I know so. She's going first.

601,00:33:41.12,00:33:41.12,you're going to be fine for a long time.
602,00:33:43.25,00:33:43.25,Vote Marisa. >> Really?
603,00:33:48.12,00:33:48.12,All right. >> My tribe will believe
604,00:33:50.50,00:33:50.50,anything I tell them at any point because they're just
605,00:33:54.62,00:33:54.62,stupid. I'm starting to make her
606,00:33:56.38,00:33:56.38,nervous. Why would you say that?
