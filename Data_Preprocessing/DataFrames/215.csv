254,00:17:04.53,00:17:07.20,I want you to know that theseare made with a great deal of

278,00:18:41.87,00:18:45.30,gotten this far.And I can already feel it
279,00:18:45.30,00:18:49.73,"starting to rise.You know, I can already feel"

292,00:19:39.43,00:19:41.83,I haven't known them longenough.
293,00:19:41.83,00:19:44.73,"But you still share a bond thatI guess you could call love, I"
294,00:19:44.73,00:19:47.40,mean because you'd have to lovesome of these people to put up
295,00:19:47.40,00:19:51.27,with them in the context that wehave for 42 days.
296,00:19:51.27,00:19:53.97,>> KEITH: I think that it seemssomewhat apropos for this

306,00:24:40.93,00:24:45.27,One of the things I've gatheredfrom chatting with you guys for
307,00:24:45.27,00:24:49.30,41 days is that this has been alife-changing experience for the
308,00:24:49.30,00:24:51.97,three of you.And part of that growth comes
309,00:24:51.97,00:24:55.43,from examining the past.That was the purpose of the walk
310,00:24:55.43,00:24:58.57,"you just took, a chance to thinkabout your former tribe members,"
311,00:24:58.57,00:25:02.07,"how they played the game, whatyou learned from them."
312,00:25:02.07,00:25:06.93,Now I want to give you a chanceto reflect on your time here in

314,00:25:11.60,00:25:16.27,and what you'll take back homewith you from this experience.

318,00:25:27.10,00:25:30.10,"you've created over the lastcouple of days, find a quiet"
319,00:25:30.10,00:25:35.10,spot and just reflect on yourtime here in the Outback.

353,00:27:50.97,00:27:54.37,when we're in our comfort zonethat we don't appreciate because

455,00:36:32.50,00:36:35.97,Keith has to vote for Tina.Their votes nullify each other.
456,00:36:35.97,00:36:38.17,You're the only person who'sgoing to vote.
457,00:36:38.17,00:36:40.67,"You are voting out one personfrom the tribe, and more"

463,00:37:33.27,00:37:36.13,The person voted out of thetribe will be asked to leave the
464,00:37:36.13,00:37:38.83,Tribal Council area immediately.Somebody who has played this
465,00:37:38.83,00:37:44.03,game for 41 days is about to bevoted out of the tribe.
466,00:37:44.03,00:37:52.57,I'll read the vote.The 14th person voted out of the
467,00:37:52.57,00:37:58.80,tribe...is Keith.
468,00:37:58.80,00:38:00.30,">> KEITH: It has been an honor,guys."

478,00:38:56.13,00:39:07.33,You can head back to camp.>> KEITH: It was an absolute
479,00:39:07.33,00:39:10.00,honor to play this game withthese participants.
480,00:39:10.00,00:39:13.37,My time here spent in theOutback really gave me an
481,00:39:13.37,00:39:16.07,"opportunity to look at life fromthe past, present and the"
482,00:39:16.07,00:39:19.40,"future.It was a great, great"
483,00:39:19.40,00:39:24.33,"opportunity, and I've learned somuch about myself because of it."
484,00:39:41.70,00:39:45.30,">> TINA: Usually, when we'veleft Tribal Council, there's"
485,00:39:45.30,00:39:51.43,been a wide range of emotions...such as Mad Dog.
486,00:39:51.43,00:39:57.13,"When we voted her off, that wasa sad day at the Ogakor camp."
487,00:39:57.13,00:39:59.40,And there were other times thatwe came back to camp where it
488,00:39:59.40,00:40:03.20,"just felt awkward.We really loved Elisabeth, and"
489,00:40:03.20,00:40:07.23,it just felt awkward almost nothaving her presence there.
490,00:40:07.23,00:40:10.37,"And there's been some times whenwe came back from camp, and we"
491,00:40:10.37,00:40:14.30,"were a little happy.>> COLBY: Golly, Tina, this is"

493,00:40:17.17,00:40:19.27,candles out if we want to.>> TINA: I know it.
494,00:40:19.27,00:40:21.57,"No longer do we have to worry,you know, ""How long will that"
495,00:40:21.57,00:40:25.50,"last?""Last night, coming into camp,"
496,00:40:25.50,00:40:31.67,"just me and Colby, I have to saythat it was sheer exhilaration."
497,00:40:31.67,00:40:34.27,"We can burn that, some of ourshelter stuff..."

501,00:40:40.40,00:40:43.53,"I accomplished something that Iwanted to do, and that was to"
502,00:40:43.53,00:40:48.10,make it to last two.I still feel that I can't
503,00:40:48.10,00:40:51.57,comprehend this.It'll be a few days before...

505,00:40:55.77,00:40:59.77,let it soak in.>> COLBY: Returning from Tribal
506,00:40:59.77,00:41:03.77,Council was the best feelingI've had in 42 days.
507,00:41:03.77,00:41:08.03,"It was a victorious feeling.16 of us started, and-and we"
508,00:41:08.03,00:41:12.97,were the two that beat 'em all.>> TINA: What else can we burn?
509,00:41:12.97,00:41:15.60,>> COLBY: What else?>> TINA: Poor Keith.
510,00:41:15.60,00:41:18.00,This would be his favoritestthing to do.
511,00:41:18.00,00:41:20.17,"This last immunity, I was anervous wreck."
512,00:41:20.17,00:41:23.77,"Had Keith won, I'm not surewhether or not he would have"
513,00:41:23.77,00:41:30.70,"voted for me to stay with him.Ooh, that's a good fire, Colby."
514,00:41:30.70,00:41:32.90,">> COLBY: I think, when it camedown to it, more than likely, he"
515,00:41:32.90,00:41:36.40,"would've kept Tina on board andgotten rid of me, so I needed to"
516,00:41:36.40,00:41:39.33,keep immunity from Keith.That was my only objective last
517,00:41:39.33,00:41:42.90,night.You're a sore loser.
518,00:41:42.90,00:41:45.17,That's what I'm realizing.You don't like losing.
519,00:41:45.17,00:41:47.33,>> TINA: I hate losing.When's the last time you won
520,00:41:47.33,00:41:50.13,something?>> TINA: Reward challenge.
521,00:41:50.13,00:41:54.17,It's the last time I've won.>> COLBY: Keith might've been
522,00:41:54.17,00:41:56.30,the only way Tina and I could'vegotten here.
523,00:41:56.30,00:41:59.63,"And trust me, we tried every waypossible to figure out how we"
524,00:41:59.63,00:42:03.03,"could vote Keith off instead ofRodger, but sometimes, you've"
525,00:42:03.03,00:42:06.33,got to bring along people thatyou don't necessarily want to.
526,00:42:06.33,00:42:07.87,>> TINA: I don't think Keithcould've made it this far on his
527,00:42:07.87,00:42:10.37,"own accord.You know, we kind of pulled"
528,00:42:10.37,00:42:14.50,Keith along.We needed a third as part of an
529,00:42:14.50,00:42:19.50,"alliance to have a majorityvote, and we've kept Keith"
530,00:42:19.50,00:42:21.77,around for that reason.>> COLBY: He got us where we
531,00:42:21.77,00:42:24.17,needed to be.>> TINA: Yep.
532,00:42:24.17,00:42:26.13,>> COLBY: And he didn't win amillion dollars.
533,00:42:26.13,00:42:28.87,"That's the best part about it.No matter what happens, Keith"
534,00:42:28.87,00:42:30.20,Famie didn't win a millionbucks.
535,00:42:30.20,00:42:32.87,( Tina chuckles )I don't think Keith earned the
536,00:42:32.87,00:42:34.77,right to sit in a position of-ofone of the final two in this
537,00:42:34.77,00:42:38.43,game.I don't think he played the game
538,00:42:38.43,00:42:42.97,in a fashion or well enough todeserve that spot.
539,00:42:48.67,00:42:52.53,">> TINA: All my jobs have alwaysbeen minimum wage jobs, except"

551,00:43:53.93,00:43:57.70,"going to get better each hourthat-that goes by, and we"
552,00:43:57.70,00:43:58.93,realize we're one step closer totonight.
553,00:43:58.93,00:44:01.83,"I mean, it's awesome.Mission accomplished."
554,00:44:01.83,00:44:04.37,"I mean, we've done everything wecan."

556,00:44:09.60,00:44:13.27,I began to feel closure for thefirst time.

558,00:44:16.00,00:44:25.47,those to take 'em home with me.>> COLBY: You can see over
559,00:44:25.47,00:44:39.40,everything.This is the appropriate place
560,00:44:39.40,00:44:43.87,for Tina and I-- the-the highestpeak that we could see or climb
561,00:44:43.87,00:44:47.80,to from our camp.Getting as high as we can and
562,00:44:47.80,00:44:50.13,literally feeling like you're ontop of the world in more ways
563,00:44:50.13,00:44:55.53,than one.They're everywhere up here.

569,00:45:08.73,00:45:11.93,>> TINA: I look at Colby.He came here for one thing: to
570,00:45:11.93,00:45:14.63,win a million dollars.He didn't come here to make
571,00:45:14.63,00:45:17.23,friends.He didn't come here for any
572,00:45:17.23,00:45:21.00,"other reason, and his actionsshow that."
573,00:45:21.00,00:45:25.30,He speaks it. He lives it.He's wide open.
574,00:45:25.30,00:45:27.07,">> COLBY: In the game of Survivor, you've got to switch"
575,00:45:27.07,00:45:30.13,hats a lot.You've got to wear a white hat
576,00:45:30.13,00:45:33.13,"part of the time, and sometimes,you got to put on the black hat,"
577,00:45:33.13,00:45:35.60,and that's the only way you cando good at this game.
578,00:45:35.60,00:45:37.90,You've got to be the bad guysometimes.

582,00:45:49.80,00:45:53.33,than anyone else.She hasn't flown under the

584,00:45:56.60,00:45:58.23,She's stayed on course theentire time.
585,00:45:58.23,00:46:02.60,I think she knew where shewanted to be and how she was
586,00:46:02.60,00:46:05.37,going to get there much earlierthan I did.
587,00:46:05.37,00:46:09.60,"41 days, I've realized that itis life's subtleties that I"
588,00:46:09.60,00:46:11.97,"cherish the most, and that's it.>> TINA: That's pretty heavy,"
589,00:46:11.97,00:46:14.10,Colby.You did some thinking on that
590,00:46:14.10,00:46:17.97,little perch.>> COLBY: I did.
591,00:46:28.17,00:46:30.20,>> TINA: How are we going to dothe flag?
592,00:46:30.20,00:46:32.10,I was going to say either winnergets it...
593,00:46:32.10,00:46:35.20,>> COLBY: I say... Yeah.>> TINA: Or we play for it.
594,00:46:35.20,00:46:36.67,">> COLBY: No, I say winner getsit."
595,00:46:36.67,00:46:45.07,>> TINA: Okay.I think it's important for Colby
596,00:46:45.07,00:46:51.13,and I to break down the camp...kind of as a tribute.
597,00:46:56.03,00:46:58.63,"That bark worked pretty good,didn't it, Colby?"
598,00:46:58.63,00:47:01.67,>> COLBY: It really did.Shelter turned out... pretty
599,00:47:01.67,00:47:05.87,effective.>> TINA: The shelter was built
600,00:47:05.87,00:47:10.70,"with no food in our system,very, very weak bodies."
601,00:47:10.70,00:47:15.33,"That day, building that shelterwas very, very tough."
602,00:47:15.33,00:47:20.97,"And to take it down now isalmost like saying, ""It was"
603,00:47:20.97,00:47:24.07,"worth it, because look where Iam."
604,00:47:24.07,00:47:28.70,"I'm one of the two.It was worth it."""
605,00:47:28.70,00:47:30.83,>> COLBY: The day this structurewent up was the worst I had ever
606,00:47:30.83,00:47:34.60,seen Tina.It was her all-time low in the
607,00:47:34.60,00:47:37.53,42 days we've been here.>> TINA: I was not only
608,00:47:37.53,00:47:40.43,"physically low, I was mentallypretty low, going..."

610,00:47:42.33,00:47:45.77,">> TINA: I thought, ""How manymore days do I have to do this?"""
611,00:47:45.77,00:47:48.60,because I was worried it wasn'tgoing to get any better.
612,00:47:48.60,00:47:50.47,>> COLBY: That was your worstday.
613,00:47:50.47,00:47:54.80,Winning this game means so muchto me and is so important to me
614,00:47:54.80,00:47:58.03,"because of the level ofdifficulty, because it's been so"
615,00:47:58.03,00:48:01.77,tough to get to this point.And it has taken so much out of
616,00:48:01.77,00:48:03.77,"me-- physically, emotionally,mentally."
617,00:48:03.77,00:48:07.33,But that's why it means so muchto win this game-- 'cause I have
618,00:48:07.33,00:48:12.50,so much invested in it.>> TINA: What it boils down to
619,00:48:12.50,00:48:17.23,"is that I've come here for 42days to starve, to live in the"
620,00:48:17.23,00:48:23.63,"type of environment that I'velived in, to make those type of"
621,00:48:23.63,00:48:28.43,sacrifices to give somebody likeElisabeth a million dollars?
622,00:48:28.43,00:48:32.23,Or did I come here to play thisgame and me deserve the million
623,00:48:32.23,00:48:35.40,dollars?>> COLBY: I've been selfish in
624,00:48:35.40,00:48:38.50,"the way I've played.However, I'm choosing to go into"
625,00:48:38.50,00:48:42.07,"the finals with Tina, and that'snot a selfish move, 'cause if I"
626,00:48:42.07,00:48:47.63,"was 100% selfish, I would chooseto go in with Keith."
627,00:48:47.63,00:48:50.73,I feel certain I probablycould've won against Keith.
628,00:48:50.73,00:48:54.47,I don't even know that I have a50-50 shot against Tina.
629,00:49:40.57,00:49:42.30,>> TINA: We'll never walk thisroad again.
630,00:49:42.30,00:49:45.17,>> COLBY: Nope.You ready?
631,00:49:45.17,00:49:51.80,TINA: Let's go.It's been great.
632,00:49:51.80,00:49:55.80,>> COLBY: Unbelievable.>> TINA: Thank you.
633,00:49:55.80,00:49:59.63,For everything.>> COLBY: Thank you.
634,00:50:11.70,00:50:17.13,"Rock and roll.Make tracks, don't look back."

637,00:50:53.63,00:50:57.53,certainly go up and shake theirhand and give them

639,00:51:02.17,00:51:06.33,out here.I would hope that who ever wins
640,00:51:06.33,00:51:10.73,has played the game as morallyand as ethically as is
641,00:51:10.73,00:51:14.17,physically possible to have doneout here in the Outback.

649,00:51:46.03,00:51:54.70,person is.>> AMBER: I'm not really liking
650,00:51:54.70,00:51:57.43,"the feeling at all, the factthat I have the chance right now"
651,00:51:57.43,00:51:59.60,to give a million dollars tosomebody.
652,00:51:59.60,00:52:02.60,"I just, I hate the feeling, youknow, I want the million"
653,00:52:02.60,00:52:04.93,dollars.It's come down to two very
654,00:52:04.93,00:52:07.60,difficult people to choosebetween.

656,00:52:14.20,00:52:17.23,tonight.That's a big deal.
657,00:52:17.23,00:52:20.23,That's a lot to think about asthey make their way walking to
658,00:52:20.23,00:52:24.37,"Tribal Council.If you look at Colby, it's"
659,00:52:24.37,00:52:30.03,"obvious that a very strong,competitive, athletic individual"
660,00:52:30.03,00:52:34.23,that knows how to get along withpeople can go very far in this
661,00:52:34.23,00:52:37.53,"game.When I look at Tina, it teaches"
662,00:52:37.53,00:52:41.27,me that an individual doesn'thave to be the strongest to go
663,00:52:41.27,00:52:44.67,"this far.She won no immunities, she won"
664,00:52:44.67,00:52:47.97,"only one reward, but she justdidn't give up."
665,00:52:47.97,00:52:51.40,"So there's one that didn't winanything, there's one that won"
666,00:52:51.40,00:52:55.27,"almost everything.The common thread is, to"
667,00:52:55.27,00:53:00.60,"believe in yourself, take thingsday by day, and don't give up."
668,00:53:04.37,00:53:07.57,>> NICK: The strange part aboutthis game is you try to build
669,00:53:07.57,00:53:11.17,friendships and relationshipsand still play the game and be
670,00:53:11.17,00:53:15.53,"successful, and it's hard toknow whether anybody is genuine."
671,00:53:15.53,00:53:19.03,"Colby is much more intelligentthan I thought he was, he's"
672,00:53:19.03,00:53:21.70,definitely been more of athinker in this game than I
673,00:53:21.70,00:53:24.37,"thought.Tina, I saw as this kind of"
674,00:53:24.37,00:53:27.83,"innocent person just going alongwith the game, and now I"
675,00:53:27.83,00:53:30.30,definitely see her as more of amastermind.
676,00:53:30.30,00:53:33.03,I think she's been thinkingsince day one what she needed to
677,00:53:33.03,00:53:39.87,do and she's done it well.>> JERRI: I'm in a position of

680,00:53:49.23,00:53:52.80,right now are the two people whobackstabbed me about three
681,00:53:52.80,00:53:57.90,different separate times.I want them to be forced to look
682,00:53:57.90,00:54:03.63,"into what they've become in thisgame, versus who they claim to"
683,00:54:03.63,00:54:15.60,be in their real lives.>> ELISABETH: I would have
684,00:54:15.60,00:54:19.73,thought that Colby's competitivenature would have lead him to be
685,00:54:19.73,00:54:25.30,voting for Tina last Council.And be up against Keith.
686,00:54:25.30,00:54:27.83,"He'd have a much cleaner shot,it would seem."
687,00:54:27.83,00:54:30.13,Do I think the best person canwin?
688,00:54:30.13,00:54:32.53,I think there's always thatpossibility.
689,00:54:32.53,00:54:36.50,"Will the best person win?Well, that's in the hands of a"
690,00:54:36.50,00:54:40.03,bunch of people who think theyare the best one.
691,00:54:40.03,00:55:06.07,So that's the tricky part.>> JEFF: We now bring in the

697,00:55:44.20,00:55:47.53,mastered human relationships.There's no other way you could
698,00:55:47.53,00:55:50.53,"end up here.But those who were voted out,"
699,00:55:50.53,00:55:53.33,"our jury, are now in control ofyour fate."
700,00:55:53.33,00:55:57.23,"And if the manner in which theywere voted out was harsh,"
701,00:55:57.23,00:55:59.57,payback could be swift andsweet.
702,00:55:59.57,00:56:04.63,That's where we're at tonight.There will be one final vote.

704,00:56:07.80,00:56:10.47,Here's how it'll work.We'll start with opening
705,00:56:10.47,00:56:14.83,"comments from the two of you tothe jury, addressing why you"
706,00:56:14.83,00:56:19.67,"deserve the million dollars.The jury then, one by, one will"
707,00:56:19.67,00:56:22.87,"ask a question to you.When they're finished, you'll"
708,00:56:22.87,00:56:24.87,get a chance to have a closingcomment.
709,00:56:24.87,00:56:27.87,"Then we'll do the vote.Before we start, I just want to"
710,00:56:27.87,00:56:30.17,poll the jury.Has anybody here shared any
711,00:56:30.17,00:56:32.53,information with anyone else inthe jury about who they're
712,00:56:32.53,00:56:34.93,voting for tonight?>> JURY: No.

734,00:57:56.10,00:57:59.13,saying that goes way back.I don't think I was necessarily
735,00:57:59.13,00:58:03.47,"the best at anything, and Idon't think I beat Tina in"
736,00:58:03.47,00:58:07.17,"strategy or any elements of thegame, but I feel like I did them"
737,00:58:07.17,00:58:12.53,all pretty good.And that's why I'm here.
738,00:58:12.53,00:58:14.57,">> JEFF: All right, jury, take amoment."
739,00:58:14.57,00:58:17.90,Collect your thoughts.You're going to each have the
740,00:58:17.90,00:58:22.00,opportunity to ask Tina andColby a question that will help
741,00:58:22.00,00:58:25.33,you decide who will be the solesurvivor.
742,00:58:44.70,00:58:47.43,>> JEFF: All right.I'll turn it over to the jury.
743,00:58:47.43,00:58:50.13,You're free to ask Colby andTina anything you want.
744,00:58:50.13,00:58:57.50,"Rodger, we'll start with you.>> RODGER: Well, Tina, Colby, a"
745,00:58:57.50,00:59:00.17,"big night for both of you, Iknow."
746,00:59:00.17,00:59:04.70,"There's been some times when youhave not always told the truth,"
747,00:59:04.70,00:59:07.73,"had to lie on occasions, that'spart of the strategy of playing"
748,00:59:07.73,00:59:10.27,the game.I'd like for both of you maybe
749,00:59:10.27,00:59:14.13,to give me a couple of instanceswhere you did not tell the
750,00:59:14.13,00:59:18.57,"truth, and then do you feel thatyou have played the game as"
751,00:59:18.57,00:59:20.93,ethically as you possibly couldhave?
752,00:59:20.93,00:59:23.53,">> TINA: Wow.>> JEFF: Tina, we'll start with"
753,00:59:23.53,00:59:25.27,you.>> TINA: Okay.
754,00:59:25.27,00:59:30.53,"I think as far as not tellingthe truth, for me personally"
755,00:59:30.53,00:59:35.43,"would come in to play wheneversomeone would come to me, like"
756,00:59:35.43,00:59:38.73,"let's say Amber, because Amberwas the one who usually would"
757,00:59:38.73,00:59:42.50,"come to us before every TribalCouncil and say, ""Okay, who are"
758,00:59:42.50,00:59:46.70,"we voting for?"" and at the pointthat it was Amber's time to go,"
759,00:59:46.70,00:59:50.37,"I, we didn't tell Amber and say,""Okay, Amber, you're the one"
760,00:59:50.37,00:59:54.50,"who's going out tonight.""So that would be an incidence of"
761,00:59:54.50,00:59:58.57,when the truth wasn't told.And as far as ethically is
762,00:59:58.57,01:00:02.93,"concerned, in playing this game,I don't think you can win it by"
763,01:00:02.93,01:00:06.57,"saying, ""Well, you know, that'sa nice person I don't want to"
764,01:00:06.57,01:00:09.43,"vote that person off.""I think you have to have more of"
765,01:00:09.43,01:00:13.27,a strategic mind.But I don't feel like that was
766,01:00:13.27,01:00:17.90,"unethical by any means.And so by my definition, I feel"
767,01:00:17.90,01:00:21.87,like I've played ethically.>> RODGER: Colby?
768,01:00:21.87,01:00:26.47,>> COLBY: Dishonesty.I have one moment that came to
769,01:00:26.47,01:00:30.77,mind was when I told Jerri if wewent into the merge with the
770,01:00:30.77,01:00:35.13,"upper hand as far as voting andwe took over, that she and Amber"
771,01:00:35.13,01:00:38.90,"and I would take this thing on,and that didn't happen."
772,01:00:38.90,01:00:42.97,And that was one point ofdishonesty there because I told
773,01:00:42.97,01:00:46.00,"her that.And as far as ethics go, if"
774,01:00:46.00,01:00:50.33,"being dishonest makes me lessethical, then maybe I had a"
775,01:00:50.33,01:00:52.10,struggle with ethics on thisthing.

777,01:01:05.60,01:01:10.20,My question is: What threethings got you to this point?

779,01:01:12.77,01:01:15.63,first three things you're goingto do with that million dollars?
780,01:01:15.63,01:01:18.13,">> JEFF: Colby, we'll start withyou."
781,01:01:18.13,01:01:24.07,>> COLBY: First would be therefusal at any point to ever
782,01:01:24.07,01:01:28.20,"mentally check out of the game,meaning just keeping my head in"
783,01:01:28.20,01:01:31.70,it the entire time.Strategizing from day one on
784,01:01:31.70,01:01:34.17,"until day 42.Second thing, water."
785,01:01:34.17,01:01:37.63,I mean that was the only thingthat kept me from getting hunger
786,01:01:37.63,01:01:41.07,pains was fooling my stomachinto thinking it was full by
787,01:01:41.07,01:01:45.17,"filling it with water.Three, taking time out to enjoy."
788,01:01:45.17,01:01:50.10,You could have gone mad in thisgame if you didn't every now and
789,01:01:50.10,01:01:53.73,then realize where you were andhow lucky we were to be here.
790,01:01:53.73,01:01:57.37,"And the first three things I'dspend it on, I'd love to buy a"
791,01:01:57.37,01:02:01.03,"Harley Davidson, would die tohave one of those."
792,01:02:01.03,01:02:04.53,"Two, my dad has restored anantique office building that"

794,01:02:07.77,01:02:10.80,and I would love to buy thatbuilding without him knowing I
795,01:02:10.80,01:02:13.33,"purchased it, and give it backto him."
796,01:02:13.33,01:02:15.90,And also financially take careof my mom.

800,01:02:28.23,01:02:31.27,could have voted me off but hedidn't.
801,01:02:31.27,01:02:36.80,So Colby definitely got me here.And the third I'd say heart
802,01:02:36.80,01:02:39.83,slash God.And the three things I'd like to
803,01:02:39.83,01:02:42.87,"do with the million, the firstthree things is pay off my"
804,01:02:42.87,01:02:48.47,"house, pay off my best friend'shouse, and Elisabeth gave me a"
805,01:02:48.47,01:02:53.20,"fantastic idea, about setting upa fund, putting money in that"
806,01:02:53.20,01:02:57.13,"fund and the interest that itdraws, spend it one time a year"
807,01:02:57.13,01:03:02.27,for a family that is in need.And I thought that was one of
808,01:03:02.27,01:03:05.43,the best ideas I've ever heard.>> AMBER: Okay.

842,01:05:38.40,01:05:41.23,here.There are some things that I did
843,01:05:41.23,01:05:46.57,as a tribe member that I feltlike were extremely giving.
844,01:05:46.57,01:05:50.83,Such as giving Keith theimmunity challenge when we were
845,01:05:50.83,01:05:57.30,standing on those poles.My least proud moment...
846,01:05:57.30,01:06:00.23,would be probably every TribalCouncil.
847,01:06:00.23,01:06:07.57,"Whenever I had to vote somebodyoff, I never felt good about"

849,01:06:12.93,01:06:19.43,"moment is probably today, forthe first time realizing how"
850,01:06:19.43,01:06:23.70,little respect I've shown thisland where we are.
851,01:06:23.70,01:06:26.43,"I mean, my head has been in thegame so much, I realized today"
852,01:06:26.43,01:06:29.57,"how little I've stopped to smellthe roses, and I wasn't very"
853,01:06:29.57,01:06:31.50,proud of that because it's takenit for granted.
854,01:06:31.50,01:06:36.77,"Um... my most proud moment wasjust a very, very simple few"
855,01:06:36.77,01:06:41.37,"seconds when I won an immunitychallenge, filling the water"
856,01:06:41.37,01:06:45.23,"buckets up simply, because I wasin dead last at the beginning of"
857,01:06:45.23,01:06:47.73,"that challenge, and I remembertelling myself, if you dig deep"
858,01:06:47.73,01:06:51.50,"on this, if you dig as deep asyou can go, you can pull this"
859,01:06:51.50,01:06:53.63,"thing off, and that was a proudmoment for me."

864,01:07:13.93,01:07:17.47,"um, there was a lot of talk ofthe following Tribal Councils"
865,01:07:17.47,01:07:20.83,"about people deserving to bearound, which is interesting to"
866,01:07:20.83,01:07:25.33,"me because had it not been for avery unfortunate accident, then"

887,01:08:19.37,01:08:23.17,there's probably no doubt in mymind that Mike would be one of

898,01:09:20.27,01:09:27.00,"eating the beef jerky.And someone said, ""Well, check"

900,01:09:31.90,01:09:35.07,the bag to look in there to seeif we saw beef jerky wrappers.

902,01:09:38.80,01:09:41.73,"I wish that hadn't been me.And so, that's the one thing"

907,01:09:55.10,01:09:57.80,I wish there was a waystrategically that we could have
