109,00:07:02.03,00:07:02.03,deal with. And you've still got to play the
110,00:07:04.17,00:07:04.17,game. You've still got to think about

118,00:07:48.53,00:07:48.53,( birds singing ) As this game is coming to an
119,00:07:52.13,00:07:52.13,"end, I think that I have evolved, that who I started out"

123,00:08:14.03,00:08:14.03,this game will get you in trouble.
124,00:08:15.87,00:08:15.87,"And even quicker, it'll get you gone."
125,00:08:17.83,00:08:17.83,And that's-that's because it's a game.
126,00:08:19.60,00:08:19.60,"And in a way, that's where it parallels life."
127,00:08:21.97,00:08:21.97,"But in a way, that's where it differs from life for me,"
128,00:08:24.87,00:08:24.87,because the only person I've been truly 100% honest to in
129,00:08:27.77,00:08:27.77,"this game is myself. And in real life, I'm not that"
130,00:08:29.23,00:08:29.23,way. I'm an honest person.
131,00:08:31.90,00:08:31.90,"But I'm playing to win a million dollars here, and so if you"
132,00:08:35.13,00:08:35.13,"trust somebody, it's your own fault."

188,00:12:50.07,00:12:50.07,( Tina sighs ) >> COLBY: Mm-hmm.
189,00:12:52.00,00:12:52.00,>> KEITH: And we didn't know each other.
190,00:12:53.97,00:12:53.97,">> TINA: I remember us talking all night long, you know, and"
191,00:12:58.60,00:12:58.60,being so excited and thinking about...
192,00:13:01.30,00:13:01.30,"I remember thinking, ""God, we've got so long to go, you know,"
193,00:13:05.97,00:13:05.97,"we've got a long road ahead of us."""
194,00:13:08.60,00:13:08.60,>> COLBY: It's been a hell of a ride.
195,00:13:10.23,00:13:10.23,">> TINA: Mm-hmm. It's been a long, long journey."
196,00:13:14.70,00:13:14.70,And everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull.
197,00:13:20.30,00:13:20.30,"And now, you've only got three days left, and the people that"
198,00:13:25.77,00:13:25.77,you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be
199,00:13:28.87,00:13:28.87,over. >> KEITH: Tonight is the last
200,00:13:35.23,00:13:35.23,night for one of us to be sleeping here.
201,00:13:40.87,00:13:40.87,Tonight is the last night for somebody.
202,00:13:44.47,00:13:44.47,>> COLBY: It is kind of weird to think about... not being here
203,00:13:48.90,00:13:48.90,"tomorrow night, isn't it? >> TINA: Oh, I mean, it kills"
204,00:13:51.03,00:13:51.03,"me. It's like... I mean, I'm ready"
205,00:13:55.50,00:13:55.50,"to go home and see my family, but I'm just... I don't want to"
206,00:13:59.87,00:13:59.87,leave this place. >> COLBY: I agree.
207,00:14:02.17,00:14:02.17,">> TINA: You know, I really love Australia, I really love the"
208,00:14:03.83,00:14:03.83,"Outback. >> COLBY: Well, and the hardest"
209,00:14:06.67,00:14:06.67,"thing for me, I think, with the possibility of leaving is it's"
210,00:14:09.43,00:14:09.43,hard for me to grasp checking out of the game before it's
211,00:14:10.93,00:14:10.93,over. >> TINA: Mmm.
212,00:14:12.87,00:14:12.87,>> COLBY: And I've never even thought about that until just
213,00:14:14.53,00:14:14.53,now. And that's what tomorrow night
214,00:14:17.27,00:14:17.27,is for somebody. >> TINA: It's not like you
215,00:14:19.87,00:14:19.87,"voluntarily are checking out, you know?"
216,00:14:21.67,00:14:21.67,>> COLBY: That's what I'm saying.
217,00:14:23.07,00:14:23.07,"I mean, that's the reality. But damn it, I'll take it like a"
218,00:14:24.70,00:14:24.70,man. ( Tina laughs )
219,00:14:26.90,00:14:26.90,">> KEITH: Yes. >> COLBY: I won't like it, but"
220,00:14:29.33,00:14:29.33,I'll take it like a man. >> KEITH: We all will.
221,00:14:31.40,00:14:31.40,">> TINA: I'm not. I'm going to have a hissy fit,"
222,00:14:33.87,00:14:33.87,and just cry and bawl and hissy fit is what I'm going to do.
223,00:14:36.73,00:14:36.73,>> COLBY: It's going to be weird sitting in Tribal Council just
224,00:14:39.67,00:14:39.67,"three chairs right there, too. >> KEITH: Ooh... is it ever."
225,00:14:42.60,00:14:42.60,>> COLBY: 'Cause it's only one vote.
226,00:14:43.97,00:14:43.97,>> TINA: Ooh! >> KEITH: Right.
227,00:14:45.73,00:14:45.73,>> COLBY: Three of us don't vote; it's just immunity.
228,00:14:47.77,00:14:47.77,">> KEITH: Right. >> COLBY: Walks up, puts his"
229,00:14:50.03,00:14:50.03,name in the bucket and comes back.
230,00:14:51.27,00:14:51.27,>> TINA: That's not gonna... that's not gonna be a fun place
231,00:14:52.87,00:14:52.87,"to be, either. >> COLBY: No..."
232,00:14:55.30,00:14:55.30,>> TINA: The immunity man or woman or...
233,00:14:56.47,00:14:56.47,">> COLBY: Nope. >> KEITH: Oh, that's right."
234,00:14:58.57,00:14:58.57,">> COLBY: One person, that's it. >> KEITH: We have an immunity"
235,00:15:01.77,00:15:01.77,"challenge coming up, the most important immunity challenge"
236,00:15:05.00,00:15:05.00,that any of us... any of us will play.
237,00:15:06.70,00:15:06.70,The winner basically gets to walk up and cast a vote.
238,00:15:09.47,00:15:09.47,"At this stage of the game, we all feel vulnerable, because at"
239,00:15:14.23,00:15:14.23,that stage it's not a voting bloc.
240,00:15:17.10,00:15:17.10,It's who you want to be in the finals with.
241,00:15:18.77,00:15:18.77,Who do you want the jury to look at sitting next to you to
242,00:15:21.40,00:15:21.40,potentially choose you over them to give you the money?
243,00:15:24.77,00:15:24.77,That's what it's about now. Tough call.
244,00:16:13.07,00:16:13.07,">> TINA: This last morning, you know, everything seems like the"
245,00:16:16.57,00:16:16.57,last for the three of us. And it's just... I know it's a
246,00:16:19.93,00:16:19.93,"game, but still it's sad, you know."
247,00:16:24.73,00:16:24.73,"It's not just a game coming to an end, but it's the game coming"
248,00:16:28.47,00:16:28.47,to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company.
249,00:16:41.67,00:16:41.67,>> KEITH: The last 24 hours has kind of been a little
250,00:16:45.20,00:16:45.20,"bittersweet. One of us is leaving tonight,"
251,00:16:48.90,00:16:48.90,one of us saw the sunset for the last time and the sunrise this
252,00:16:52.73,00:16:52.73,morning for the last time. One of us had the last meal with
253,00:16:57.87,00:16:57.87,us together. So it was... it's kind of...
254,00:17:00.60,00:17:00.60,"you know, it's strange, it's bittersweet, it's sad."
255,00:17:04.53,00:17:04.53,I want you to know that these are made with a great deal of
256,00:17:07.20,00:17:07.20,love and passion for you guys. This is not just a normal
257,00:17:08.57,00:17:08.57,breakfast. >> TINA: And I just want you to
258,00:17:12.10,00:17:12.10,know that they're eaten with a great deal of love and passion.
259,00:17:14.37,00:17:14.37,>> KEITH: From the bottom of this chef's heart to you guys'
260,00:17:16.43,00:17:16.43,stomach. >> TINA: Thank you.
261,00:17:19.13,00:17:19.13,">> KEITH: Mm-hmm. Oh, that one's warm."
262,00:17:25.03,00:17:25.03,>> COLBY: I don't want to think about leaving tonight.
263,00:17:27.97,00:17:27.97,It's a very real possibility. This whole experience has been
264,00:17:32.03,00:17:32.03,"full of firsts and lasts, every day."
265,00:17:34.50,00:17:34.50,But that's just one facet I don't like dwelling on.
266,00:17:40.73,00:17:40.73,">> KEITH: What do we have there, Colby?"
267,00:17:45.63,00:17:45.63,>> COLBY: Madam. >> KEITH: What is it?
268,00:17:48.97,00:17:48.97,">> TINA: ""And now it is time to pack up your gear."
269,00:17:53.87,00:17:53.87,The ridge of the river is the course you will steer.
270,00:18:01.57,00:18:01.57,You will pass by the torches of the survivors cut adrift.
271,00:18:07.80,00:18:07.80,"When you reach the end, you will offer your gift."""
272,00:18:12.83,00:18:12.83,>> KEITH: The tree mail gave instructions on where we should
273,00:18:16.43,00:18:16.43,"go with the totem that we created, and we're going to"
274,00:18:19.40,00:18:19.40,walk past the torches of all the survivors that went before us.
275,00:18:23.63,00:18:23.63,"And at the end of the walk, we're going to offer the gift up"
276,00:18:26.53,00:18:26.53,"that we made. >> TINA: Every now and then, you"
277,00:18:32.60,00:18:32.60,"get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact, and"
278,00:18:38.03,00:18:38.03,you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've
279,00:18:41.87,00:18:41.87,gotten this far. And I can already feel it
280,00:18:45.30,00:18:45.30,"starting to rise. You know, I can already feel"
281,00:18:49.73,00:18:49.73,"the... anxiety of some sort in my chest and a warm fuzzy, you"
282,00:18:55.07,00:18:55.07,"know, coming on. And I don't think this is going"
283,00:18:57.07,00:18:57.07,"to be easy. I think this is going to be, you"
284,00:19:00.87,00:19:00.87,"know, one of those times of saying good-bye."
285,00:19:06.57,00:19:06.57,And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard.
286,00:19:11.27,00:19:11.27,"You know, my gosh, we've been put through the wringer."
287,00:19:14.00,00:19:14.00,"I don't know why it should be so hard, but, uh... it's hard to"
288,00:19:16.80,00:19:16.80,say good-bye. >> COLBY: I think the three of
289,00:19:27.67,00:19:27.67,us are very emotionally attached to each other right now.
290,00:19:30.30,00:19:30.30,"And if the word ""love"" comes out of your mouth, then that's the"
291,00:19:33.20,00:19:33.20,"emotion you're feeling at that time, you know?"
292,00:19:36.60,00:19:36.60,"I don't love the two of them like I love my family, not yet."
293,00:19:39.43,00:19:39.43,I haven't known them long enough.
294,00:19:41.83,00:19:41.83,"But you still share a bond that I guess you could call love, I"
295,00:19:44.73,00:19:44.73,mean because you'd have to love some of these people to put up
296,00:19:47.40,00:19:47.40,with them in the context that we have for 42 days.
297,00:19:51.27,00:19:51.27,>> KEITH: I think that it seems somewhat apropos for this
298,00:19:53.97,00:19:53.97,"situation, you know? That we'd walk past individuals"
299,00:19:58.27,00:19:58.27,that left before us. One of us will be leaving
300,00:20:01.07,00:20:01.07,"tonight, and there'll be two left."
301,00:20:02.67,00:20:02.67,So I'm actually... I'm looking forward to it.
302,00:20:06.30,00:20:06.30,I guess it's kind of a saying good-bye process.

307,00:24:40.93,00:24:40.93,One of the things I've gathered from chatting with you guys for
308,00:24:45.27,00:24:45.27,41 days is that this has been a life-changing experience for the
309,00:24:49.30,00:24:49.30,three of you. And part of that growth comes
310,00:24:51.97,00:24:51.97,from examining the past. That was the purpose of the walk
311,00:24:55.43,00:24:55.43,"you just took, a chance to think about your former tribe members,"
312,00:24:58.57,00:24:58.57,"how they played the game, what you learned from them."
313,00:25:02.07,00:25:02.07,Now I want to give you a chance to reflect on your time here in
314,00:25:06.93,00:25:06.93,"the Outback, how you've played the game, the highs, the lows"
315,00:25:11.60,00:25:11.60,and what you'll take back home with you from this experience.
316,00:25:16.27,00:25:16.27,"This is the last waterfall before Tribal Council, a fitting"
317,00:25:20.43,00:25:20.43,spot to think about the time you've spent out here.
318,00:25:24.07,00:25:24.07,So what I'd like you to do is take the idols with you that
319,00:25:27.10,00:25:27.10,"you've created over the last couple of days, find a quiet"
320,00:25:30.10,00:25:30.10,spot and just reflect on your time here in the Outback.
321,00:25:35.10,00:25:35.10,"And when you're ready, come back to this spot and then offer your"
322,00:25:38.90,00:25:38.90,idols by tossing them in the river.
323,00:25:42.20,00:25:42.20,This is a chance for you guys to give something back to a land
324,00:25:45.43,00:25:45.43,"that has given so much to you. When you're finished, you'll"
325,00:25:49.97,00:25:49.97,make the trek together to Tribal Council for the final immunity
326,00:25:53.53,00:25:53.53,"challenge, and I'll be waiting for you there."
327,00:25:57.20,00:25:57.20,Enjoy this time. All right.
328,00:26:04.63,00:26:04.63,>> KEITH: The time that I've spent here has been a cleansing
329,00:26:07.90,00:26:07.90,"process. And I'm 40 years old, I've got"
330,00:26:12.00,00:26:12.00,"two wonderful kids, and have had, like any other individual"
331,00:26:16.20,00:26:16.20,"who's 40 years old, have had failures and successes and highs"
332,00:26:18.53,00:26:18.53,"and lows. In the last five days, I've"
333,00:26:21.90,00:26:21.90,"realized this really is not about the money, and it"
334,00:26:23.97,00:26:23.97,shouldn't be. You should walk away from this
335,00:26:28.00,00:26:28.00,"with something that's far more valuable than money, and I will."
336,00:26:31.93,00:26:31.93,I don't think that I have the opportunity to win the money.
337,00:26:34.80,00:26:34.80,I don't think I'll be at that level.
338,00:26:36.23,00:26:36.23,"I mean, I'm close, but I don't think I'll be of the last two,"
339,00:26:39.00,00:26:39.00,and it's totally fine with me. I'm so enriched by everything
340,00:26:42.43,00:26:42.43,I've gained from this process and this experience.
341,00:26:45.47,00:26:45.47,I feel really great about it. I feel very content.
342,00:26:57.93,00:26:57.93,>> TINA: I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of
343,00:27:01.60,00:27:01.60,people who are extremely close to their family.
344,00:27:04.87,00:27:04.87,"I think that, you know, I've been guilty of living my life"
345,00:27:08.70,00:27:08.70,and trying to be this strong individual who didn't really
346,00:27:14.20,00:27:14.20,"need anybody and, um... and ver... fiercely independent."
347,00:27:20.70,00:27:20.70,"And I think for the first time in my life, the outback has"
348,00:27:23.87,00:27:23.87,taught me the value of how much your family means to you and
349,00:27:27.47,00:27:27.47,that you really do need each other.
350,00:27:30.53,00:27:30.53,"And whenever I get home, I want to go back and, for the first"
351,00:27:33.33,00:27:33.33,"time, really nurture my family. >> COLBY: That's what being here"
352,00:27:44.27,00:27:44.27,for 42 days has done for us-- it's made us realize what we
353,00:27:47.50,00:27:47.50,take for granted at home and all those things in our daily living
354,00:27:50.97,00:27:50.97,when we're in our comfort zone that we don't appreciate because
355,00:27:54.37,00:27:54.37,"we're so used to having them. Well, we've been out here for 42"
356,00:27:57.67,00:27:57.67,"days, and now we appreciate those things back home."
357,00:28:00.57,00:28:00.57,Now we appreciate those people that we've taken for granted and
358,00:28:03.97,00:28:03.97,"the little things they say, the way they say our name and all"
359,00:28:07.33,00:28:07.33,those cool things that you can't wait to get back to.
360,00:28:10.13,00:28:10.13,"And that's what making these idols was about, so that we"
361,00:28:13.27,00:28:13.27,appreciate and remember why we were here.
362,00:29:09.70,00:29:09.70,">> JEFF: Hey, guys. Go ahead and have a seat."
363,00:29:13.70,00:29:13.70,Just hold your tablets. We'll now bring in the jury.
364,00:29:29.50,00:29:29.50,"I'll start by asking you to pass down the immunity necklace,"
365,00:29:31.70,00:29:31.70,"Colby. Well, welcome to Tribal Council"
366,00:29:41.93,00:29:41.93,in a slightly different set of circumstances.
367,00:29:45.57,00:29:45.57,You guys have just completed a day that was really a rite of
368,00:29:49.10,00:29:49.10,"passage, a chance to remember your former tribe mates."
369,00:29:52.70,00:29:52.70,"Now, the final immunity challenge will test how well you"
370,00:29:55.50,00:29:55.50,know the folks you've spent the last 41 days with.
371,00:29:59.13,00:29:59.13,"It's called ""Fallen Comrades."" I'm going to ask you a series of"
372,00:30:02.27,00:30:02.27,"questions about those people you voted out of the tribe, six of"
373,00:30:05.10,00:30:05.10,which are sitting right across from you.
374,00:30:07.60,00:30:07.60,There'll be 12 questions about your former tribe mates.
375,00:30:10.67,00:30:10.67,"Whoever has the most correct answers wins immunity,"
376,00:30:14.33,00:30:14.33,guarantees themselves a spot in the final two and the right to
377,00:30:18.97,00:30:18.97,choose the person that sits next to them.
378,00:30:20.87,00:30:20.87,"So you're going to write your answers in big, bold letters on"
379,00:30:24.27,00:30:24.27,"your tablet, hold it up to your chest until I tell you to, and"
380,00:30:27.50,00:30:27.50,then turn it around. Question number one: which
381,00:30:31.50,00:30:31.50,"former survivor would be the one to tell you to ""work your"
382,00:30:34.43,00:30:34.43,"magic""? Okay, turn them around, please."
383,00:30:47.40,00:30:47.40,"Everybody says Alicia. Everybody's right, it was"
384,00:30:49.40,00:30:49.40,Alicia. Question number two: what town
385,00:30:53.47,00:30:53.47,is Rodger from? Everybody reveal.
386,00:31:02.30,00:31:02.30,"Critteden. Crittenden. Criton. All right, you were there."
387,00:31:04.97,00:31:04.97,Everybody's right. >> KEITH: I couldn't spell
388,00:31:06.47,00:31:06.47,"""Crittenden."" >> JEFF: Question number three:"
389,00:31:10.30,00:31:10.30,"according to their Survivor applications, who was the only"
390,00:31:14.27,00:31:14.27,member of the Barramundi tribe with a master's degree?
391,00:31:29.03,00:31:29.03,"Everybody reveal. Nick, Nick and Jeff."
392,00:31:34.33,00:31:34.33,Everybody's wrong. It's Rodger. He had a master's of arts in
393,00:31:37.37,00:31:37.37,industrial education. >> TINA: He never told us that.
394,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,>> JEFF: Nobody scores on that one.
395,00:31:43.47,00:31:43.47,Question number four: who spent 12 years living in Germany?
396,00:31:52.50,00:31:52.50,"Reveal. Jerri, Jerri, Jerri."
397,00:31:55.13,00:31:55.13,Everybody's right. We're still tied at three each.
398,00:32:00.27,00:32:00.27,Question number five. It's a visual question.
399,00:32:04.53,00:32:04.53,"Who is this person? >> JEFF: Okay, everybody ready?"
400,00:32:22.93,00:32:22.93,"Reveal. Kenny, Elisabeth's brother and"
401,00:32:27.47,00:32:27.47,Johnny. Kenny is Elisabeth's brother.
402,00:32:31.43,00:32:31.43,"Colby and Tina are both right. Colby and Tina, you're both at"
403,00:32:34.80,00:32:34.80,"four. Keith, you're at three."
404,00:32:38.17,00:32:38.17,Question number six: what two survivors have tattoos of
405,00:32:42.03,00:32:42.03,"Chinese characters? Okay, reveal."
406,00:32:53.07,00:32:53.07,Keith says Alicia and Amber. Tina says Alicia and Nick.
407,00:32:57.10,00:32:57.10,Colby: Jeff and Kimmi. Nobody's right.
408,00:33:00.17,00:33:00.17,It was Alicia and Jeff Varner. Question number seven: Jeff and
409,00:33:04.07,00:33:04.07,Alicia also wear jewelry on the same part of their body.
410,00:33:09.10,00:33:09.10,"What is it, and where do they wear it?"
411,00:33:16.47,00:33:16.47,"Okay, everybody reveal. Colby says thumb ring."
412,00:33:20.40,00:33:20.40,"Tina, ring on the toe. And Keith says bracelet and foot"
413,00:33:22.53,00:33:22.53,anklet. Colby's right. Thumb rings they
414,00:33:24.90,00:33:24.90,both wear. >> TINA: Colby.
415,00:33:28.63,00:33:28.63,Colby moves into the lead with five.
416,00:33:30.23,00:33:30.23,"Tina, you're at four. Keith, still at three."
417,00:33:33.30,00:33:33.30,Five questions left. Question number eight: whose
418,00:33:35.97,00:33:35.97,shorts are these? Everybody reveal.
419,00:33:58.07,00:33:58.07,"Jeff, Nick and Kel. Correct answer: Nick."
420,00:34:06.07,00:34:06.07,"Tina now has five, along with Colby."
421,00:34:08.20,00:34:08.20,"Keith, you're still at three. Four questions left."
422,00:34:12.37,00:34:12.37,What is Elisabeth's boyfriend's name?
423,00:34:22.97,00:34:22.97,"Everybody reveal. Tim, Tim, Tim."
424,00:34:27.00,00:34:27.00,Everybody's right. Three questions left.
425,00:34:32.07,00:34:32.07,"Colby and Tina are tied. Keith, you're down two."
426,00:34:35.70,00:34:35.70,Question ten. It's a follow-up question.
427,00:34:38.90,00:34:38.90,What college did they both attend?
428,00:34:48.87,00:34:48.87,Everybody reveal. Colby says Boston College.
429,00:34:52.20,00:34:52.20,"Tina, Boston College. Keith, Boston University."
430,00:34:55.50,00:34:55.50,Boston University not correct. It's Boston College.
431,00:34:58.90,00:34:58.90,"Colby and Tina both score. Colby, you have seven."
432,00:35:02.33,00:35:02.33,"Tina, you've got seven. Keith, you only have four."
433,00:35:05.40,00:35:05.40,You're down three. Just two questions left.
434,00:35:08.27,00:35:08.27,No need for you to answer any more.
435,00:35:10.97,00:35:10.97,"Colby, Tina, it's down to you two."
436,00:35:13.20,00:35:13.20,Question number 11: who said on their Survivor application that
437,00:35:17.33,00:35:17.33,they would like to be stranded with President Clinton or the
438,00:35:20.00,00:35:20.00,"Pope, because they're the most likely to be rescued?"
439,00:35:23.97,00:35:23.97,( laughs ) Everybody reveal.
440,00:35:35.13,00:35:35.13,Jeff and Alicia. Neither one is right.
441,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,Nick is the correct answer. >> TINA: Oh...
442,00:35:41.37,00:35:41.37,>> JEFF: Here we are-- the final question.
443,00:35:42.90,00:35:42.90,"Colby, you've got seven. Tina, you've got seven."
444,00:35:45.10,00:35:45.10,This is it. One of you gets it right and the
445,00:35:48.47,00:35:48.47,"other doesn't, immunity, going to the final two."
446,00:35:52.50,00:35:52.50,"""Who stated on their Survivor application form that their"
447,00:35:56.10,00:35:56.10,proudest accomplishment was being on the dean's list in
448,00:35:59.83,00:35:59.83,"college for five semesters?"" For immunity, reveal your"
449,00:36:07.47,00:36:07.47,answers. Tina says Nick.
450,00:36:14.03,00:36:14.03,Colby says Amber. Correct answer...
451,00:36:18.33,00:36:18.33,Amber. >> COLBY: Yeah!
452,00:36:21.27,00:36:21.27,>> JEFF: Colby continues his streak.
453,00:36:22.57,00:36:22.57,You've just won immunity. Here's where we're at: it's time
454,00:36:26.23,00:36:26.23,for the final vote. Keith and Tina can't vote for
455,00:36:29.37,00:36:29.37,themselves. Tina has to vote for Keith.
456,00:36:32.50,00:36:32.50,Keith has to vote for Tina. Their votes nullify each other.
457,00:36:35.97,00:36:35.97,You're the only person who's going to vote.
458,00:36:38.17,00:36:38.17,"You are voting out one person from the tribe, and more"
459,00:36:40.67,00:36:40.67,"importantly, you are deciding who's going to go to the final"
460,00:36:43.30,00:36:43.30,"two with you. So you're going to go up there,"
461,00:36:46.07,00:36:46.07,"cast that very important vote, put it in the box and bring the"
462,00:36:48.90,00:36:48.90,"box back with you to me. It's time to vote, Colby."
463,00:37:31.23,00:37:31.23,"Once the vote is read, the decision is final."
464,00:37:33.27,00:37:33.27,The person voted out of the tribe will be asked to leave the
465,00:37:36.13,00:37:36.13,Tribal Council area immediately. Somebody who has played this
466,00:37:38.83,00:37:38.83,game for 41 days is about to be voted out of the tribe.
467,00:37:44.03,00:37:44.03,I'll read the vote. The 14th person voted out of the
468,00:37:52.57,00:37:52.57,tribe... is Keith.
469,00:37:58.80,00:37:58.80,">> KEITH: It has been an honor, guys."
470,00:38:00.30,00:38:00.30,>> TINA: I love you. >> KEITH: Aw...
471,00:38:03.07,00:38:03.07,>> TINA: See you soon. >> COLBY: Good job.
472,00:38:13.57,00:38:13.57,">> JEFF: Keith, the tribe has spoken."
473,00:38:36.97,00:38:36.97,Long day for you guys. Tonight'll be the last night you
474,00:38:40.10,00:38:40.10,"spend under these stars. Tomorrow, an even bigger day."
475,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"Final Tribal Council, a final vote that will determine which"
476,00:38:47.77,00:38:47.77,one of you leaves here with a million dollars and the title of
477,00:38:50.80,00:38:50.80,Survivor: The Australian Outback.
478,00:38:53.83,00:38:53.83,Try to get a good night's sleep. You're going to need it.
479,00:38:56.13,00:38:56.13,You can head back to camp. >> KEITH: It was an absolute
480,00:39:07.33,00:39:07.33,honor to play this game with these participants.
481,00:39:10.00,00:39:10.00,My time here spent in the Outback really gave me an
482,00:39:13.37,00:39:13.37,"opportunity to look at life from the past, present and the"
483,00:39:16.07,00:39:16.07,"future. It was a great, great"
484,00:39:19.40,00:39:19.40,"opportunity, and I've learned so much about myself because of it."
485,00:39:41.70,00:39:41.70,">> TINA: Usually, when we've left Tribal Council, there's"
486,00:39:45.30,00:39:45.30,been a wide range of emotions... such as Mad Dog.
487,00:39:51.43,00:39:51.43,"When we voted her off, that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp."
488,00:39:57.13,00:39:57.13,And there were other times that we came back to camp where it
489,00:39:59.40,00:39:59.40,"just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth, and"
490,00:40:03.20,00:40:03.20,it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there.
491,00:40:07.23,00:40:07.23,"And there's been some times when we came back from camp, and we"
492,00:40:10.37,00:40:10.37,"were a little happy. >> COLBY: Golly, Tina, this is"
493,00:40:14.30,00:40:14.30,"our last night, girl. We can afford to burn those"
494,00:40:17.17,00:40:17.17,candles out if we want to. >> TINA: I know it.
495,00:40:19.27,00:40:19.27,"No longer do we have to worry, you know, ""How long will that"
496,00:40:21.57,00:40:21.57,"last?"" Last night, coming into camp,"
497,00:40:25.50,00:40:25.50,"just me and Colby, I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration."
498,00:40:31.67,00:40:31.67,"We can burn that, some of our shelter stuff..."
499,00:40:34.27,00:40:34.27,">> COLBY: I mean, seriously, like this twine."
500,00:40:36.10,00:40:36.10,"We don't need it, do we? >> TINA: Nope."
501,00:40:38.10,00:40:38.10,">> COLBY: It burns good. >> TINA: Burn it, baby."
502,00:40:40.40,00:40:40.40,"I accomplished something that I wanted to do, and that was to"
503,00:40:43.53,00:40:43.53,make it to last two. I still feel that I can't
504,00:40:48.10,00:40:48.10,comprehend this. It'll be a few days before...
505,00:40:51.57,00:40:51.57,">> COLBY: Oh, sure. >> TINA: ...you know, to even"
506,00:40:55.77,00:40:55.77,let it soak in. >> COLBY: Returning from Tribal
507,00:40:59.77,00:40:59.77,Council was the best feeling I've had in 42 days.
508,00:41:03.77,00:41:03.77,"It was a victorious feeling. 16 of us started, and-and we"
509,00:41:08.03,00:41:08.03,were the two that beat 'em all. >> TINA: What else can we burn?
510,00:41:12.97,00:41:12.97,>> COLBY: What else? >> TINA: Poor Keith.
511,00:41:15.60,00:41:15.60,This would be his favoritest thing to do.
512,00:41:18.00,00:41:18.00,"This last immunity, I was a nervous wreck."
513,00:41:20.17,00:41:20.17,"Had Keith won, I'm not sure whether or not he would have"
514,00:41:23.77,00:41:23.77,"voted for me to stay with him. Ooh, that's a good fire, Colby."
515,00:41:30.70,00:41:30.70,">> COLBY: I think, when it came down to it, more than likely, he"
516,00:41:32.90,00:41:32.90,"would've kept Tina on board and gotten rid of me, so I needed to"
517,00:41:36.40,00:41:36.40,keep immunity from Keith. That was my only objective last
518,00:41:39.33,00:41:39.33,night. You're a sore loser.
519,00:41:42.90,00:41:42.90,That's what I'm realizing. You don't like losing.
520,00:41:45.17,00:41:45.17,>> TINA: I hate losing. When's the last time you won
521,00:41:47.33,00:41:47.33,something? >> TINA: Reward challenge.
522,00:41:50.13,00:41:50.13,It's the last time I've won. >> COLBY: Keith might've been
523,00:41:54.17,00:41:54.17,the only way Tina and I could've gotten here.
524,00:41:56.30,00:41:56.30,"And trust me, we tried every way possible to figure out how we"
525,00:41:59.63,00:41:59.63,"could vote Keith off instead of Rodger, but sometimes, you've"
526,00:42:03.03,00:42:03.03,got to bring along people that you don't necessarily want to.
527,00:42:06.33,00:42:06.33,>> TINA: I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his
528,00:42:07.87,00:42:07.87,"own accord. You know, we kind of pulled"
529,00:42:10.37,00:42:10.37,Keith along. We needed a third as part of an
530,00:42:14.50,00:42:14.50,"alliance to have a majority vote, and we've kept Keith"
531,00:42:19.50,00:42:19.50,around for that reason. >> COLBY: He got us where we
532,00:42:21.77,00:42:21.77,needed to be. >> TINA: Yep.
533,00:42:24.17,00:42:24.17,>> COLBY: And he didn't win a million dollars.
534,00:42:26.13,00:42:26.13,"That's the best part about it. No matter what happens, Keith"
535,00:42:28.87,00:42:28.87,Famie didn't win a million bucks.
536,00:42:30.20,00:42:30.20,( Tina chuckles ) I don't think Keith earned the
537,00:42:32.87,00:42:32.87,right to sit in a position of-of one of the final two in this
538,00:42:34.77,00:42:34.77,game. I don't think he played the game
539,00:42:38.43,00:42:38.43,in a fashion or well enough to deserve that spot.
540,00:42:48.67,00:42:48.67,">> TINA: All my jobs have always been minimum wage jobs, except"
541,00:42:52.53,00:42:52.53,"for when I was a flight attendant, and so I've never"
542,00:42:55.83,00:42:55.83,felt like I've been a contributing factor financially.
543,00:42:59.50,00:42:59.50,"You know, however much money it is, I've contributed to the"
544,00:43:02.17,00:43:02.17,family financial situation. >> COLBY: Yep.
545,00:43:04.10,00:43:04.10,>> TINA: And it just makes me feel so good.
546,00:43:06.20,00:43:06.20,>> COLBY: And you earned it. You worked hard for it.
547,00:43:08.13,00:43:08.13,>> TINA: Whew! >> COLBY: You know?
548,00:43:10.40,00:43:10.40,">> TINA: Good night, my friend. ( insects chirping )"
549,00:43:45.93,00:43:45.93,( Colby groans ) >> TINA: Good morning.
550,00:43:48.40,00:43:48.40,"( Colby murmurs indistinctly ) >> TINA: Mm, you're warm."
551,00:43:50.60,00:43:50.60,">> COLBY: It's a great day. I mean, it is... it is only"
552,00:43:53.93,00:43:53.93,"going to get better each hour that-that goes by, and we"
553,00:43:57.70,00:43:57.70,realize we're one step closer to tonight.
554,00:43:58.93,00:43:58.93,"I mean, it's awesome. Mission accomplished."
555,00:44:01.83,00:44:01.83,"I mean, we've done everything we can."
556,00:44:06.87,00:44:06.87,>> TINA: I felt joy. I felt peace.
557,00:44:09.60,00:44:09.60,I began to feel closure for the first time.
558,00:44:13.27,00:44:13.27,"I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures, capturing"
559,00:44:16.00,00:44:16.00,those to take 'em home with me. >> COLBY: You can see over
560,00:44:25.47,00:44:25.47,everything. This is the appropriate place
561,00:44:39.40,00:44:39.40,for Tina and I-- the-the highest peak that we could see or climb
562,00:44:43.87,00:44:43.87,to from our camp. Getting as high as we can and
563,00:44:47.80,00:44:47.80,literally feeling like you're on top of the world in more ways
564,00:44:50.13,00:44:50.13,than one. They're everywhere up here.
565,00:44:55.53,00:44:55.53,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven..."
566,00:44:57.70,00:44:57.70,">> TINA: And here's some more. >> COLBY: ...eight, nine, ten."
567,00:44:59.97,00:44:59.97,">> TINA: God, they're fast, aren't they?"
568,00:45:04.73,00:45:04.73,>> COLBY: That I'm going to miss-- just kangaroos running
569,00:45:06.40,00:45:06.40,wild. ( Tina chuckles )
570,00:45:08.73,00:45:08.73,>> TINA: I look at Colby. He came here for one thing: to
571,00:45:11.93,00:45:11.93,win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make
572,00:45:14.63,00:45:14.63,friends. He didn't come here for any
573,00:45:17.23,00:45:17.23,"other reason, and his actions show that."
574,00:45:21.00,00:45:21.00,He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open.
575,00:45:25.30,00:45:25.30,">> COLBY: In the game of  Survivor, you've got to switch"
576,00:45:27.07,00:45:27.07,hats a lot. You've got to wear a white hat
577,00:45:30.13,00:45:30.13,"part of the time, and sometimes, you got to put on the black hat,"
578,00:45:33.13,00:45:33.13,and that's the only way you can do good at this game.
579,00:45:35.60,00:45:35.60,You've got to be the bad guy sometimes.
580,00:45:37.90,00:45:37.90,"You've got to be a little bit selfish, but hopefully, in the"
581,00:45:40.27,00:45:40.27,"end, you wore a white hat more of the time than you did a black"
582,00:45:42.30,00:45:42.30,hat. Tina has played the game better
583,00:45:49.80,00:45:49.80,than anyone else. She hasn't flown under the
584,00:45:53.33,00:45:53.33,"radar; however, she hasn't ruffled any feathers."
585,00:45:56.60,00:45:56.60,She's stayed on course the entire time.
586,00:45:58.23,00:45:58.23,I think she knew where she wanted to be and how she was
587,00:46:02.60,00:46:02.60,going to get there much earlier than I did.
588,00:46:05.37,00:46:05.37,"41 days, I've realized that it is life's subtleties that I"
589,00:46:09.60,00:46:09.60,"cherish the most, and that's it. >> TINA: That's pretty heavy,"
590,00:46:11.97,00:46:11.97,Colby. You did some thinking on that
591,00:46:14.10,00:46:14.10,little perch. >> COLBY: I did.
592,00:46:28.17,00:46:28.17,>> TINA: How are we going to do the flag?
593,00:46:30.20,00:46:30.20,I was going to say either winner gets it...
594,00:46:32.10,00:46:32.10,>> COLBY: I say... Yeah. >> TINA: Or we play for it.
595,00:46:35.20,00:46:35.20,">> COLBY: No, I say winner gets it."
596,00:46:36.67,00:46:36.67,>> TINA: Okay. I think it's important for Colby
597,00:46:45.07,00:46:45.07,and I to break down the camp... kind of as a tribute.
598,00:46:56.03,00:46:56.03,"That bark worked pretty good, didn't it, Colby?"
599,00:46:58.63,00:46:58.63,>> COLBY: It really did. Shelter turned out... pretty
600,00:47:01.67,00:47:01.67,effective. >> TINA: The shelter was built
601,00:47:05.87,00:47:05.87,"with no food in our system, very, very weak bodies."
602,00:47:10.70,00:47:10.70,"That day, building that shelter was very, very tough."
603,00:47:15.33,00:47:15.33,"And to take it down now is almost like saying, ""It was"
604,00:47:20.97,00:47:20.97,"worth it, because look where I am."
605,00:47:24.07,00:47:24.07,"I'm one of the two. It was worth it."""
606,00:47:28.70,00:47:28.70,>> COLBY: The day this structure went up was the worst I had ever
607,00:47:30.83,00:47:30.83,seen Tina. It was her all-time low in the
608,00:47:34.60,00:47:34.60,42 days we've been here. >> TINA: I was not only
609,00:47:37.53,00:47:37.53,"physically low, I was mentally pretty low, going..."
610,00:47:40.43,00:47:40.43,">> COLBY: You were done, mentally."
611,00:47:42.33,00:47:42.33,">> TINA: I thought, ""How many more days do I have to do this?"""
612,00:47:45.77,00:47:45.77,because I was worried it wasn't going to get any better.
613,00:47:48.60,00:47:48.60,>> COLBY: That was your worst day.
614,00:47:50.47,00:47:50.47,Winning this game means so much to me and is so important to me
615,00:47:54.80,00:47:54.80,"because of the level of difficulty, because it's been so"
616,00:47:58.03,00:47:58.03,tough to get to this point. And it has taken so much out of
617,00:48:01.77,00:48:01.77,"me-- physically, emotionally, mentally."
618,00:48:03.77,00:48:03.77,But that's why it means so much to win this game-- 'cause I have
619,00:48:07.33,00:48:07.33,so much invested in it. >> TINA: What it boils down to
620,00:48:12.50,00:48:12.50,"is that I've come here for 42 days to starve, to live in the"
621,00:48:17.23,00:48:17.23,"type of environment that I've lived in, to make those type of"
622,00:48:23.63,00:48:23.63,sacrifices to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars?
623,00:48:28.43,00:48:28.43,Or did I come here to play this game and me deserve the million
624,00:48:32.23,00:48:32.23,dollars? >> COLBY: I've been selfish in
625,00:48:35.40,00:48:35.40,"the way I've played. However, I'm choosing to go into"
626,00:48:38.50,00:48:38.50,"the finals with Tina, and that's not a selfish move, 'cause if I"
627,00:48:42.07,00:48:42.07,"was 100% selfish, I would choose to go in with Keith."
628,00:48:47.63,00:48:47.63,I feel certain I probably could've won against Keith.
629,00:48:50.73,00:48:50.73,I don't even know that I have a 50-50 shot against Tina.
630,00:49:40.57,00:49:40.57,>> TINA: We'll never walk this road again.
631,00:49:42.30,00:49:42.30,>> COLBY: Nope. You ready?
632,00:49:45.17,00:49:45.17,TINA: Let's go. It's been great.
633,00:49:51.80,00:49:51.80,>> COLBY: Unbelievable. >> TINA: Thank you.
634,00:49:55.80,00:49:55.80,For everything. >> COLBY: Thank you.
635,00:50:11.70,00:50:11.70,"Rock and roll. Make tracks, don't look back."
636,00:50:44.83,00:50:44.83,">> RODGER: Well, this is Day 42. The jury is meeting tonight to"
637,00:50:50.03,00:50:50.03,"decide on the final two, and whoever the winner is, I'll"
638,00:50:53.63,00:50:53.63,certainly go up and shake their hand and give them
639,00:50:57.53,00:50:57.53,"congratulations, because this game is not an easy game to play"
640,00:51:02.17,00:51:02.17,out here. I would hope that who ever wins
641,00:51:06.33,00:51:06.33,has played the game as morally and as ethically as is
642,00:51:10.73,00:51:10.73,physically possible to have done out here in the Outback.
643,00:51:14.17,00:51:14.17,"And to tell you the truth, I have not made up my mind yet who"
644,00:51:17.33,00:51:17.33,I'm voting for. >> ALICIA: You know that this
645,00:51:27.37,00:51:27.37,"night is going to come, and it all comes down to this."
646,00:51:30.03,00:51:30.03,"I have a few questions lined up, and I can't wait to hear the"
647,00:51:35.53,00:51:35.53,"responses, which of those two is still on their toes, still"
648,00:51:39.27,00:51:39.27,"thinking, still focused, still has a clear head after"
649,00:51:42.73,00:51:42.73,everything they've been through. And I can't wait to see who that
650,00:51:46.03,00:51:46.03,person is. >> AMBER: I'm not really liking
651,00:51:54.70,00:51:54.70,"the feeling at all, the fact that I have the chance right now"
652,00:51:57.43,00:51:57.43,to give a million dollars to somebody.
653,00:51:59.60,00:51:59.60,"I just, I hate the feeling, you know, I want the million"
654,00:52:02.60,00:52:02.60,dollars. It's come down to two very
655,00:52:04.93,00:52:04.93,difficult people to choose between.
656,00:52:11.30,00:52:11.30,>> KEITH: Everything they've worked for is coming down to
657,00:52:14.20,00:52:14.20,tonight. That's a big deal.
658,00:52:17.23,00:52:17.23,That's a lot to think about as they make their way walking to
659,00:52:20.23,00:52:20.23,"Tribal Council. If you look at Colby, it's"
660,00:52:24.37,00:52:24.37,"obvious that a very strong, competitive, athletic individual"
661,00:52:30.03,00:52:30.03,that knows how to get along with people can go very far in this
662,00:52:34.23,00:52:34.23,"game. When I look at Tina, it teaches"
663,00:52:37.53,00:52:37.53,me that an individual doesn't have to be the strongest to go
664,00:52:41.27,00:52:41.27,"this far. She won no immunities, she won"
665,00:52:44.67,00:52:44.67,"only one reward, but she just didn't give up."
666,00:52:47.97,00:52:47.97,"So there's one that didn't win anything, there's one that won"
667,00:52:51.40,00:52:51.40,"almost everything. The common thread is, to"
668,00:52:55.27,00:52:55.27,"believe in yourself, take things day by day, and don't give up."
669,00:53:04.37,00:53:04.37,>> NICK: The strange part about this game is you try to build
670,00:53:07.57,00:53:07.57,friendships and relationships and still play the game and be
671,00:53:11.17,00:53:11.17,"successful, and it's hard to know whether anybody is genuine."
672,00:53:15.53,00:53:15.53,"Colby is much more intelligent than I thought he was, he's"
673,00:53:19.03,00:53:19.03,definitely been more of a thinker in this game than I
674,00:53:21.70,00:53:21.70,"thought. Tina, I saw as this kind of"
675,00:53:24.37,00:53:24.37,"innocent person just going along with the game, and now I"
676,00:53:27.83,00:53:27.83,definitely see her as more of a mastermind.
677,00:53:30.30,00:53:30.30,I think she's been thinking since day one what she needed to
678,00:53:33.03,00:53:33.03,do and she's done it well. >> JERRI: I'm in a position of
679,00:53:39.87,00:53:39.87,"power again, and I like it. So I'm ready to go and vote."
680,00:53:46.77,00:53:46.77,The two people that are in the running for a million bucks
681,00:53:49.23,00:53:49.23,right now are the two people who backstabbed me about three
682,00:53:52.80,00:53:52.80,different separate times. I want them to be forced to look
683,00:53:57.90,00:53:57.90,"into what they've become in this game, versus who they claim to"
684,00:54:03.63,00:54:03.63,be in their real lives. >> ELISABETH: I would have
685,00:54:15.60,00:54:15.60,thought that Colby's competitive nature would have lead him to be
686,00:54:19.73,00:54:19.73,voting for Tina last Council. And be up against Keith.
687,00:54:25.30,00:54:25.30,"He'd have a much cleaner shot, it would seem."
688,00:54:27.83,00:54:27.83,Do I think the best person can win?
689,00:54:30.13,00:54:30.13,I think there's always that possibility.
690,00:54:32.53,00:54:32.53,"Will the best person win? Well, that's in the hands of a"
691,00:54:36.50,00:54:36.50,bunch of people who think they are the best one.
692,00:54:40.03,00:54:40.03,So that's the tricky part. >> JEFF: We now bring in the
693,00:55:06.07,00:55:06.07,"final Tribal Council jury. 42 days, and it comes down to"
694,00:55:27.60,00:55:27.60,this. One final Tribal Council.
695,00:55:31.47,00:55:31.47,"You guys have endured floods, out of control wildfires,"
696,00:55:37.03,00:55:37.03,"incredible heat, very cold nights and severe hunger."
697,00:55:40.83,00:55:40.83,But you're sitting here as the final two because you have
698,00:55:44.20,00:55:44.20,mastered human relationships. There's no other way you could
699,00:55:47.53,00:55:47.53,"end up here. But those who were voted out,"
700,00:55:50.53,00:55:50.53,"our jury, are now in control of your fate."
701,00:55:53.33,00:55:53.33,"And if the manner in which they were voted out was harsh,"
702,00:55:57.23,00:55:57.23,payback could be swift and sweet.
703,00:55:59.57,00:55:59.57,That's where we're at tonight. There will be one final vote.
704,00:56:04.63,00:56:04.63,"Before we get to that vote, we're going to have an exchange."
705,00:56:07.80,00:56:07.80,Here's how it'll work. We'll start with opening
706,00:56:10.47,00:56:10.47,"comments from the two of you to the jury, addressing why you"
707,00:56:14.83,00:56:14.83,"deserve the million dollars. The jury then, one by, one will"
708,00:56:19.67,00:56:19.67,"ask a question to you. When they're finished, you'll"
709,00:56:22.87,00:56:22.87,get a chance to have a closing comment.
710,00:56:24.87,00:56:24.87,"Then we'll do the vote. Before we start, I just want to"
711,00:56:27.87,00:56:27.87,poll the jury. Has anybody here shared any
712,00:56:30.17,00:56:30.17,information with anyone else in the jury about who they're
713,00:56:32.53,00:56:32.53,voting for tonight? >> JURY: No.
714,00:56:34.93,00:56:34.93,">> JEFF: All right. Tina, the floor is yours."
715,00:56:38.60,00:56:38.60,>> TINA: Strategy played a big part in getting here.
716,00:56:42.60,00:56:42.60,"The strategy for Survivor is outwit, outplay, outlast."
717,00:56:48.00,00:56:48.00,I'm not going to sit here and tell you why you should vote for
718,00:56:51.50,00:56:51.50,me. I will say the one thing that I
719,00:56:54.70,00:56:54.70,"hope that you don't do, is that you don't cast your vote based"
720,00:56:59.03,00:56:59.03,on that you got your feelings hurt.
721,00:57:02.00,00:57:02.00,"I think it's poor sportsmanship, and I don't think that it"
722,00:57:06.30,00:57:06.30,relays who the true survivor is. It just shows that you got your
723,00:57:10.60,00:57:10.60,feelings hurt. So it's up to you guys from here
724,00:57:14.10,00:57:14.10,on out. It's been a pleasure and a joy.
725,00:57:17.67,00:57:17.67,"I know whenever I go home, I go home to a husband who treats me"
726,00:57:21.23,00:57:21.23,"like a princess and who I worship and adore, and two"
727,00:57:24.03,00:57:24.03,children who I'm so happy to be their mom.
728,00:57:27.03,00:57:27.03,And that's worth more to me than a million dollars.
729,00:57:29.90,00:57:29.90,"I wish that for all of you. >> JEFF: Colby, the floor is"
730,00:57:37.07,00:57:37.07,"yours. >> COLBY: Well, I guess we're"
731,00:57:42.90,00:57:42.90,supposed to make a spiel here about why we deserve a million
732,00:57:47.17,00:57:47.17,"dollars or why I deserve it over Tina, and I don't know that I"
733,00:57:50.63,00:57:50.63,do. You've got to be a jack of all
734,00:57:53.10,00:57:53.10,"trades, but not necessarily a master of any, and that's an old"
735,00:57:56.10,00:57:56.10,saying that goes way back. I don't think I was necessarily
736,00:57:59.13,00:57:59.13,"the best at anything, and I don't think I beat Tina in"
737,00:58:03.47,00:58:03.47,"strategy or any elements of the game, but I feel like I did them"
738,00:58:07.17,00:58:07.17,all pretty good. And that's why I'm here.
739,00:58:12.53,00:58:12.53,">> JEFF: All right, jury, take a moment."
740,00:58:14.57,00:58:14.57,Collect your thoughts. You're going to each have the
741,00:58:17.90,00:58:17.90,opportunity to ask Tina and Colby a question that will help
742,00:58:22.00,00:58:22.00,you decide who will be the sole survivor.
743,00:58:44.70,00:58:44.70,>> JEFF: All right. I'll turn it over to the jury.
744,00:58:47.43,00:58:47.43,You're free to ask Colby and Tina anything you want.
745,00:58:50.13,00:58:50.13,"Rodger, we'll start with you. >> RODGER: Well, Tina, Colby, a"
746,00:58:57.50,00:58:57.50,"big night for both of you, I know."
747,00:59:00.17,00:59:00.17,"There's been some times when you have not always told the truth,"
748,00:59:04.70,00:59:04.70,"had to lie on occasions, that's part of the strategy of playing"
749,00:59:07.73,00:59:07.73,the game. I'd like for both of you maybe
750,00:59:10.27,00:59:10.27,to give me a couple of instances where you did not tell the
751,00:59:14.13,00:59:14.13,"truth, and then do you feel that you have played the game as"
752,00:59:18.57,00:59:18.57,ethically as you possibly could have?
753,00:59:20.93,00:59:20.93,">> TINA: Wow. >> JEFF: Tina, we'll start with"
754,00:59:23.53,00:59:23.53,you. >> TINA: Okay.
755,00:59:25.27,00:59:25.27,"I think as far as not telling the truth, for me personally"
756,00:59:30.53,00:59:30.53,"would come in to play whenever someone would come to me, like"
757,00:59:35.43,00:59:35.43,"let's say Amber, because Amber was the one who usually would"
758,00:59:38.73,00:59:38.73,"come to us before every Tribal Council and say, ""Okay, who are"
759,00:59:42.50,00:59:42.50,"we voting for?"" and at the point that it was Amber's time to go,"
760,00:59:46.70,00:59:46.70,"I, we didn't tell Amber and say, ""Okay, Amber, you're the one"
761,00:59:50.37,00:59:50.37,"who's going out tonight."" So that would be an incidence of"
762,00:59:54.50,00:59:54.50,when the truth wasn't told. And as far as ethically is
763,00:59:58.57,00:59:58.57,"concerned, in playing this game, I don't think you can win it by"
764,01:00:02.93,01:00:02.93,"saying, ""Well, you know, that's a nice person I don't want to"
765,01:00:06.57,01:00:06.57,"vote that person off."" I think you have to have more of"
766,01:00:09.43,01:00:09.43,a strategic mind. But I don't feel like that was
767,01:00:13.27,01:00:13.27,"unethical by any means. And so by my definition, I feel"
768,01:00:17.90,01:00:17.90,like I've played ethically. >> RODGER: Colby?
769,01:00:21.87,01:00:21.87,>> COLBY: Dishonesty. I have one moment that came to
770,01:00:26.47,01:00:26.47,mind was when I told Jerri if we went into the merge with the
771,01:00:30.77,01:00:30.77,"upper hand as far as voting and we took over, that she and Amber"
772,01:00:35.13,01:00:35.13,"and I would take this thing on, and that didn't happen."
773,01:00:38.90,01:00:38.90,And that was one point of dishonesty there because I told
774,01:00:42.97,01:00:42.97,"her that. And as far as ethics go, if"
775,01:00:46.00,01:00:46.00,"being dishonest makes me less ethical, then maybe I had a"
776,01:00:50.33,01:00:50.33,struggle with ethics on this thing.
777,01:00:55.00,01:00:55.00,">> JEFF: Amber. >> AMBER: Well, here we are."
778,01:01:05.60,01:01:05.60,My question is: What three things got you to this point?
779,01:01:10.20,01:01:10.20,"And, if you were to win the million dollars, what are the"
780,01:01:12.77,01:01:12.77,first three things you're going to do with that million dollars?
781,01:01:15.63,01:01:15.63,">> JEFF: Colby, we'll start with you."
782,01:01:18.13,01:01:18.13,>> COLBY: First would be the refusal at any point to ever
783,01:01:24.07,01:01:24.07,"mentally check out of the game, meaning just keeping my head in"
784,01:01:28.20,01:01:28.20,it the entire time. Strategizing from day one on
785,01:01:31.70,01:01:31.70,"until day 42. Second thing, water."
786,01:01:34.17,01:01:34.17,I mean that was the only thing that kept me from getting hunger
787,01:01:37.63,01:01:37.63,pains was fooling my stomach into thinking it was full by
788,01:01:41.07,01:01:41.07,"filling it with water. Three, taking time out to enjoy."
789,01:01:45.17,01:01:45.17,You could have gone mad in this game if you didn't every now and
790,01:01:50.10,01:01:50.10,then realize where you were and how lucky we were to be here.
791,01:01:53.73,01:01:53.73,"And the first three things I'd spend it on, I'd love to buy a"
792,01:01:57.37,01:01:57.37,"Harley Davidson, would die to have one of those."
793,01:02:01.03,01:02:01.03,"Two, my dad has restored an antique office building that"
794,01:02:04.53,01:02:04.53,"he's going to have to sell because of financial reasons,"
795,01:02:07.77,01:02:07.77,and I would love to buy that building without him knowing I
796,01:02:10.80,01:02:10.80,"purchased it, and give it back to him."
797,01:02:13.33,01:02:13.33,And also financially take care of my mom.
798,01:02:15.90,01:02:15.90,Those three things. >> JEFF: Tina?
799,01:02:20.13,01:02:20.13,">> TINA: The three things that got me here, was strategy."
800,01:02:23.37,01:02:23.37,"I think Colby, I think he had a big part, I mean last night he"
801,01:02:28.23,01:02:28.23,could have voted me off but he didn't.
802,01:02:31.27,01:02:31.27,So Colby definitely got me here. And the third I'd say heart
803,01:02:36.80,01:02:36.80,slash God. And the three things I'd like to
804,01:02:39.83,01:02:39.83,"do with the million, the first three things is pay off my"
805,01:02:42.87,01:02:42.87,"house, pay off my best friend's house, and Elisabeth gave me a"
806,01:02:48.47,01:02:48.47,"fantastic idea, about setting up a fund, putting money in that"
807,01:02:53.20,01:02:53.20,"fund and the interest that it draws, spend it one time a year"
808,01:02:57.13,01:02:57.13,for a family that is in need. And I thought that was one of
809,01:03:02.27,01:03:02.27,the best ideas I've ever heard. >> AMBER: Okay.
810,01:03:08.53,01:03:08.53,>> JEFF: Elisabeth. >> ELISABETH: The theme of
811,01:03:17.10,01:03:17.10,deserving has woven its way into many Councils.
812,01:03:20.63,01:03:20.63,If you had the power to give five of the jury members here
813,01:03:24.87,01:03:24.87,"before you this million dollar prize, what are the names, no"
814,01:03:28.70,01:03:28.70,"explanation, what are the names of the two that you would"
815,01:03:31.70,01:03:31.70,"exclude from that prize? >> JEFF: Tina, we'll start with"
816,01:03:33.83,01:03:33.83,you. >> TINA: Jerri and Rodger.
817,01:03:39.53,01:03:39.53,>> JEFF: Colby? >> COLBY: Jerri... and Keith.
818,01:03:52.47,01:03:52.47,">> JEFF: Keith. >> KEITH: Well, guys, I've"
819,01:04:01.83,01:04:01.83,played this game with you for 41 days.
820,01:04:04.97,01:04:04.97,"I know how political it is and how political it becomes, I also"
821,01:04:09.53,01:04:09.53,know that manipulation comes into play.
822,01:04:13.20,01:04:13.20,"Each of you, give me an instance where you used manipulation to"
823,01:04:17.60,01:04:17.60,get you where you're at right now.
824,01:04:20.53,01:04:20.53,">> JEFF: Colby. >> COLBY: When Tina and I, on"
825,01:04:25.10,01:04:25.10,"the way to Tribal Council, decided to vote Mitchell off and"
826,01:04:30.90,01:04:30.90,"break an alliance, thus manipulating the whole setting,"
827,01:04:35.80,01:04:35.80,"to first get the team to the merge stronger, thus getting me"
828,01:04:39.90,01:04:39.90,farther in the game. >> JEFF: Tina.
829,01:04:42.50,01:04:42.50,>> TINA: I would say the exact same thing.
830,01:04:44.67,01:04:44.67,"Like Colby, I knew that if we made the decision to vote you"
831,01:04:48.23,01:04:48.23,"off and keep Mitchell, that it made our team weaker."
832,01:04:51.47,01:04:51.47,"You can call it manipulation if you want to, I prefer to call it"
833,01:04:54.57,01:04:54.57,strategy. >> JEFF: Alicia.
834,01:05:07.77,01:05:07.77,>> ALICIA: It's nice to see you guys and I want to congratulate
835,01:05:10.53,01:05:10.53,you both on a job well done. A lot of things have happened.
836,01:05:14.00,01:05:14.00,I'm sure there's a lot of things that you both probably would
837,01:05:16.67,01:05:16.67,like to forget and a lot of things you never want to forget.
838,01:05:19.00,01:05:19.00,"And in light of that, I have a two-part question for you."
839,01:05:23.47,01:05:23.47,"What I want to know is, what one particular thing are you"
840,01:05:27.47,01:05:27.47,"personally most proud of, and on the flip side of that, least"
841,01:05:31.00,01:05:31.00,proud of personally. >> JEFF: Tina.
842,01:05:34.30,01:05:34.30,>> TINA: I think I am most proud of maybe the role I've played
843,01:05:38.40,01:05:38.40,here. There are some things that I did
844,01:05:41.23,01:05:41.23,as a tribe member that I felt like were extremely giving.
845,01:05:46.57,01:05:46.57,Such as giving Keith the immunity challenge when we were
846,01:05:50.83,01:05:50.83,standing on those poles. My least proud moment...
847,01:05:57.30,01:05:57.30,would be probably every Tribal Council.
848,01:06:00.23,01:06:00.23,"Whenever I had to vote somebody off, I never felt good about"
849,01:06:07.57,01:06:07.57,doing that. >> COLBY: Uh... least proud
850,01:06:12.93,01:06:12.93,"moment is probably today, for the first time realizing how"
851,01:06:19.43,01:06:19.43,little respect I've shown this land where we are.
852,01:06:23.70,01:06:23.70,"I mean, my head has been in the game so much, I realized today"
853,01:06:26.43,01:06:26.43,"how little I've stopped to smell the roses, and I wasn't very"
854,01:06:29.57,01:06:29.57,proud of that because it's taken it for granted.
855,01:06:31.50,01:06:31.50,"Um... my most proud moment was just a very, very simple few"
856,01:06:36.77,01:06:36.77,"seconds when I won an immunity challenge, filling the water"
857,01:06:41.37,01:06:41.37,"buckets up simply, because I was in dead last at the beginning of"
858,01:06:45.23,01:06:45.23,"that challenge, and I remember telling myself, if you dig deep"
859,01:06:47.73,01:06:47.73,"on this, if you dig as deep as you can go, you can pull this"
860,01:06:51.50,01:06:51.50,"thing off, and that was a proud moment for me."
861,01:06:53.63,01:06:53.63,>> ALICIA: Thank you. >> JEFF: Nick.
862,01:07:05.73,01:07:05.73,>> NICK: First I want to say I think you guys have both played
863,01:07:08.03,01:07:08.03,"a hell of a game. And, uh... I have a lot of"
864,01:07:11.57,01:07:11.57,"respect for both of you. After you guys gave me the boot,"
865,01:07:13.93,01:07:13.93,"um, there was a lot of talk of the following Tribal Councils"
866,01:07:17.47,01:07:17.47,"about people deserving to be around, which is interesting to"
867,01:07:20.83,01:07:20.83,"me because had it not been for a very unfortunate accident, then"
868,01:07:25.33,01:07:25.33,"in all likelihood, neither of you two would be sitting here"
869,01:07:28.03,01:07:28.03,"right now. So, my question is this: If Mike"
870,01:07:30.13,01:07:30.13,"had never had his accident, who would be sitting in your place,"
871,01:07:33.67,01:07:33.67,"which two people, and why? >> JEFF: Colby."
872,01:07:38.13,01:07:38.13,">> COLBY: This is gonna sound like a lot of schmooze, but one"
873,01:07:40.20,01:07:40.20,of those two people I think would be you.
874,01:07:42.00,01:07:42.00,"And I don't know what happened before the merge, but I know"
875,01:07:44.17,01:07:44.17,"when we came together, you had the mental game going and were"
876,01:07:46.93,01:07:46.93,"ready to take it on to the end. Uh, and seeing the way Mike"
877,01:07:51.00,01:07:51.00,"helped you guys out in just about every... every, uh..."
878,01:07:53.53,01:07:53.53,"challenge we faced, you know, I mean I don't know the guy, but"
879,01:07:56.43,01:07:56.43,"I'd say he had a pretty good shot of being in the end, too."
880,01:07:58.30,01:07:58.30,"I mean, obviously, we'll never know, but I think if we went"
881,01:08:00.90,01:08:00.90,"into the merge different, and you guys had the upper hand, I'd"
882,01:08:03.73,01:08:03.73,say it's probably going to be you two guys.
883,01:08:05.23,01:08:05.23,>> JEFF: TINA. >> TINA: Because I didn't really
884,01:08:08.27,01:08:08.27,get a chance to know you all that well and to get the
885,01:08:10.97,01:08:10.97,"dynamics of what went on, I really can't answer that"
886,01:08:13.37,01:08:13.37,question. I do think that the way that you
887,01:08:16.37,01:08:16.37,"all described him and some of the actions that he took,"
888,01:08:19.37,01:08:19.37,there's probably no doubt in my mind that Mike would be one of
889,01:08:23.17,01:08:23.17,the people sitting up here. >> JEFF: Jerri.
890,01:08:36.73,01:08:36.73,">> JERRI: During the course of this game, you have had to make"
891,01:08:39.30,01:08:39.30,"and break promises, you've had to manipulate."
892,01:08:43.97,01:08:43.97,I want to allow you to clear your conscience by bringing up
893,01:08:51.20,01:08:51.20,any moments during the course of this game that you might have
894,01:08:53.93,01:08:53.93,"felt some sense of guilt, remorse or regret for something"
895,01:08:58.30,01:08:58.30,you might have done to another person.
896,01:09:01.93,01:09:01.93,>> JEFF: Tina. >> TINA: I think one of the
897,01:09:06.17,01:09:06.17,"things, or the thing that I feel worse about, was the day that we"
898,01:09:15.13,01:09:15.13,"came back to the Ogakor tribe, and Kel had been accused of"
899,01:09:20.27,01:09:20.27,"eating the beef jerky. And someone said, ""Well, check"
900,01:09:27.00,01:09:27.00,"his bags,"" and I was standing there by his bag and opening up"
901,01:09:31.90,01:09:31.90,the bag to look in there to see if we saw beef jerky wrappers.
902,01:09:35.07,01:09:35.07,"Afterwards I thought: Oh, I wish I hadn't been standing there and"
903,01:09:38.80,01:09:38.80,"I wish that hadn't been me. And so, that's the one thing"
904,01:09:41.73,01:09:41.73,that I feel worst about. >> JEFF: Colby.
905,01:09:44.20,01:09:44.20,>> COLBY: I think guilt... guilty would be the word that I
906,01:09:46.83,01:09:46.83,would use for a couple of instances.
907,01:09:50.47,01:09:50.47,"I feel guilty about, um... Rodger and Elisabeth."
908,01:09:55.10,01:09:55.10,I wish there was a way strategically that we could have
909,01:09:57.80,01:09:57.80,played differently. And Alicia.
910,01:09:59.67,01:09:59.67,"You know, there were a lot of reasons for voting off a lot of"
911,01:10:01.77,01:10:01.77,"people, but Alicia was the first one I volleyed on to go, and it"

950,01:13:13.90,01:13:13.90,And I think Tina is more deserving because she has really
951,01:13:20.87,01:13:20.87,played this game. It wasn't winning seven or eight
952,01:13:24.90,01:13:24.90,challenges that got her here. It was strategy and using her

1016,01:21:10.77,01:21:10.77,great things I think anyway about Survivor is that it offers
1017,01:21:14.30,01:21:14.30,"you perspective. I mean, how often do you get a"
1018,01:21:16.80,01:21:16.80,chance where you get to have 16 strangers together who are going
1019,01:21:19.87,01:21:19.87,"to ultimately give you their opinion, what they think about"
1020,01:21:23.10,01:21:23.10,"you, how you play, how you interact socially, who you are"
1021,01:21:26.03,01:21:26.03,as a person? And then you get to watch it
1022,01:21:28.37,01:21:28.37,"play out, learn what they think about you and also view yourself"
1023,01:21:31.37,01:21:31.37,and maybe gain some new insight into your own self-perception.
1024,01:21:36.03,01:21:36.03,Had we read these votes in Australia moments after the jury
1025,01:21:40.43,01:21:40.43,"cast them, you'd have no chance for reflection."
1026,01:21:42.73,01:21:42.73,It happened immediately. You've had a lot of time for
1027,01:21:45.87,01:21:45.87,reflection. As you watch that final day and
1028,01:21:49.33,01:21:49.33,"the final Tribal Council play out, any second-guessing going"

1032,01:21:59.60,01:21:59.60,I think that there's so many things that come into playing

1034,01:22:07.33,01:22:07.33,"So, there are so many things that could have happened that"

1041,01:22:30.67,01:22:30.67,more. That one threw me by surprise.
1042,01:22:33.70,01:22:33.70,"But no. I'm just... man, let's get it"
1043,01:22:36.50,01:22:36.50,on. I'm excited.
