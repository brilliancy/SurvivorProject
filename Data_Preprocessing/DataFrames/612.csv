2,00:00:01.33,00:00:01.33,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.33,00:00:03.33,"With Alex, Jenna, Heidi and Rob"
4,00:00:05.73,00:00:05.73," secure in their alliance,  Butch, Matt and Christy"
5,00:00:08.03,00:00:08.03, were left doing all the work.
6,00:00:09.73,00:00:09.73,"CHRISTY:  Sometimes it's like, come on,"
7,00:00:11.43,00:00:11.43, get off your butt and go  and try to do something.
8,00:00:14.03,00:00:14.03,And they just do jack ...
9,00:00:15.87,00:00:15.87,"PROBST: At the auction, letters from home caused a stir"
10,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57, and delivered good news  to a relieved Jenna.
11,00:00:22.37,00:00:22.37,HEIDI: Jenna's mom is sick;  she has cancer.
12,00:00:24.30,00:00:24.30, And she started crying  because her mom
13,00:00:26.00,00:00:26.00, had written  that the brain tumor
14,00:00:29.33,00:00:29.33,had decreased by 50%.
15,00:00:31.50,00:00:31.50,PROBST:  When Alex boldly told Rob
16,00:00:33.27,00:00:33.27, of his plans  for the final four...
17,00:00:35.30,00:00:35.30,"If I win immunity, my vote goes for you."
18,00:00:37.73,00:00:37.73,Are you cool with that?
19,00:00:39.10,00:00:39.10, ...Rob set a plan in motion  to save his skin.
20,00:00:42.13,00:00:42.13,"Me, you, Butch and Christy vote out Alex tomorrow."
21,00:00:44.23,00:00:44.23,That's what I was thinking.
22,00:00:45.73,00:00:45.73," And with his victory  at the immunity challenge,"
23,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00, Rob was firmly in control.
24,00:00:50.33,00:00:50.33,These are my people.
25,00:00:51.77,00:00:51.77," At Tribal Council, Jenna  and Heidi were stunned to find"
26,00:00:55.53,00:00:55.53, Rob had turned on  their alliance.
27,00:00:57.43,00:00:57.43,Alex was the ninth person voted  out of the Amazon and became
28,00:01:01.47,00:01:01.47, the third member of the jury.
29,00:01:03.63,00:01:03.63, Six are left.
30,00:01:05.17,00:01:05.17, Who will be voted out tonight?
31,00:02:07.30,00:02:07.30,(thunder crashing)
32,00:02:15.03,00:02:15.03,"Stick with the, um, dry stuff."
33,00:02:17.83,00:02:17.83,"Actually, it may start just running on coals."
34,00:02:19.87,00:02:19.87,Yeah.
35,00:02:21.07,00:02:21.07,-How's it looking? -It's starting.
36,00:02:22.87,00:02:22.87,Slowly but surely.
37,00:02:24.37,00:02:24.37,"-Mm-mm. -JENNA: At Tribal Council,"
38,00:02:25.83,00:02:25.83," when I heard the vote,  I almost passed out."
39,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83, I felt betrayed more than  I've ever felt in my life.
40,00:02:31.47,00:02:31.47,Rob screwed the alliance.
41,00:02:32.77,00:02:32.77,"He betrayed me and Heidi, he betrayed Alex."
42,00:02:35.33,00:02:35.33,I couldn't imagine how Alex felt.
43,00:02:36.73,00:02:36.73, I didn't think  that people would sacrifice
44,00:02:38.60,00:02:38.60, personal relationships  for a gamble.
45,00:02:40.90,00:02:40.90, We hate him.
46,00:02:42.10,00:02:42.10, Me and Heidi  cannot ever forgive him.
47,00:02:44.10,00:02:44.10,"Yeah, I-I just want... I want to say something."
48,00:02:46.90,00:02:46.90,I voted probably differently than-than
49,00:02:49.17,00:02:49.17,some people expected me to vote tonight.
50,00:02:51.73,00:02:51.73,And it wasn't because
51,00:02:53.30,00:02:53.30,"I don't like Alex, but I just felt as though"
52,00:02:56.90,00:02:56.90,there were a lot of things
53,00:02:58.13,00:02:58.13,that he was telling me that weren't true.
54,00:02:59.53,00:02:59.53,And if anybody wants to speak with me about
55,00:03:02.23,00:03:02.23,"w-what I did, then, uh, I have n-no problem."
56,00:03:06.50,00:03:06.50,I also thoroughly enjoyed Alex's company throughout the game.
57,00:03:10.20,00:03:10.20,I have experienced
58,00:03:13.40,00:03:13.40,many instances when he has been deceptive.
59,00:03:15.90,00:03:15.90,"HEIDI: Everybody took  their turn talking,"
60,00:03:18.53,00:03:18.53,"except Jenna and I, because if I would have talked at that point,"
61,00:03:21.60,00:03:21.60, I would have had  every single cuss word
62,00:03:23.80,00:03:23.80, come out of my mouth  at that time.
63,00:03:26.10,00:03:26.10,MATTHEW: I'd also like to add
64,00:03:27.73,00:03:27.73,that I don't harbor any ill will towards either of you ladies.
65,00:03:32.47,00:03:32.47,"Uh, it's a game."
66,00:03:33.47,00:03:33.47,You both voted against me.
67,00:03:35.37,00:03:35.37,"I can't say that I'm gonna forget it,"
68,00:03:36.90,00:03:36.90,"but it's not going to affect, uh, the way"
69,00:03:39.43,00:03:39.43,we interact here at camp.
70,00:03:41.47,00:03:41.47,-Okay? -Good.
71,00:03:42.57,00:03:42.57,Good.
72,00:03:52.60,00:03:52.60,"HEIDI: It's just that, everything I've done in"
73,00:03:54.67,00:03:54.67,this game-- there's three guys here that I have helped out.
74,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67,They... Butch wouldn't even be here right now...
75,00:04:00.40,00:04:00.40,I know. I...
76,00:04:01.93,00:04:01.93,(sobbing)
77,00:04:02.93,00:04:02.93,HEIDI:  I've never felt
78,00:04:04.07,00:04:04.07," so manipulated, cheated"
79,00:04:07.20,00:04:07.20,and hurt all at the same time in my entire life.
80,00:04:09.70,00:04:09.70,ROB: I'm sorry that I hurt you guys.
81,00:04:13.57,00:04:13.57,But it's time to evaluate what you're willing
82,00:04:17.10,00:04:17.10,to do to win this game.
83,00:04:18.63,00:04:18.63,I'm not willing to turn my back on people that I love.
84,00:04:21.67,00:04:21.67,I'm not willing to do that. (sniffles)
85,00:04:23.80,00:04:23.80,ROB: Jenna and Heidi  were under the impression
86,00:04:27.37,00:04:27.37, that they were in the majority
87,00:04:28.93,00:04:28.93,and that they were gonna ride this majority until the end.
88,00:04:31.70,00:04:31.70," But now the tables  are completely turned,"
89,00:04:34.20,00:04:34.20, and it's Jenna and Heidi
90,00:04:36.33,00:04:36.33,who are gonna have to kiss some serious ass
91,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80,in the next couple days to ensure that one of them makes it
92,00:04:42.83,00:04:42.83, at least three more.
93,00:04:44.03,00:04:44.03,(sniffles)
94,00:04:45.30,00:04:45.30,(thunder rumbles)
95,00:05:08.90,00:05:08.90,MATTHEW:  What happened yesterday was
96,00:05:11.57,00:05:11.57, it rained for about two hours.
97,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10, It rained hard.
98,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33, Our shelter is not waterproof.
99,00:05:18.23,00:05:18.23, The water was leaking  through the roof.
100,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50," Uh, the roof  wasn't built correctly"
101,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60," from the beginning,  and everyone"
102,00:05:25.83,00:05:25.83,was miserable.
103,00:05:27.53,00:05:27.53,And then what we'll do is we're gonna bring it down like this
104,00:05:30.07,00:05:30.07,so it's on a nice slant and do the same thing there.
105,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,"Boom, boom, boom."
106,00:05:34.40,00:05:34.40,My suggestion was that we build  another fire shelter
107,00:05:37.20,00:05:37.20," right adjacent to this one,"
108,00:05:40.03,00:05:40.03,"but use it for people and our belongings,"
109,00:05:43.30,00:05:43.30,as opposed to fire.
110,00:05:44.63,00:05:44.63, It's a real--  it's very easy to do.
111,00:05:46.03,00:05:46.03, We just have to string  a couple poles across
112,00:05:48.90,00:05:48.90, and merely stack  a lot of the palm fronds.
113,00:05:51.83,00:05:51.83,(thunder crashes)
114,00:05:53.23,00:05:53.23,"That's rain coming in, guys."
115,00:05:54.67,00:05:54.67,"-Okay. Palm fronds, buckets up. -Get ready."
116,00:05:56.87,00:05:56.87,Let's layer them right now.
117,00:05:58.57,00:05:58.57," So it's a quick fix,  it does work,"
118,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93, and that's the project
119,00:06:01.97,00:06:01.97,for this morning.
120,00:06:17.53,00:06:17.53,Try and work your way across.
121,00:06:19.07,00:06:19.07,ROB: My right and your right.
122,00:06:20.27,00:06:20.27,-Your right. -Okay.
123,00:06:22.13,00:06:22.13,Piss off.
124,00:06:23.70,00:06:23.70,JENNA: There's no way  we're throwing in the towel.
125,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17, We've done all we can do.
126,00:06:27.03,00:06:27.03,"Someone stabbed us in the back, and eventually they'll pay."
127,00:06:29.93,00:06:29.93,"You never know who to trust out here, right?"
128,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,HEIDI: No.
129,00:06:33.70,00:06:33.70,"I've never lied to you, ever."
130,00:06:36.53,00:06:36.53,"I-I would never-- I'd never lie to you, as well."
131,00:06:40.17,00:06:40.17,"-Hmm. -But then again, that's part of the game, right?"
132,00:06:42.57,00:06:42.57,"What do you do, you know?"
133,00:06:44.10,00:06:44.10,-Nothing. -Nothing.
134,00:06:45.37,00:06:45.37,"When we're gone, they said you're next."
135,00:06:47.57,00:06:47.57,Probably.
136,00:06:48.67,00:06:48.67,-And that sucks. -Yeah.
137,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,"HEIDI: I woke up this morning  and I said, you know what,"
138,00:06:52.63,00:06:52.63,I didn't get out here 31 days
139,00:06:55.17,00:06:55.17,to be screwed over and just take it.
140,00:06:57.93,00:06:57.93,Doesn't it make you mad that we've come this far
141,00:07:00.50,00:07:00.50,and then those three guys are getting ready to vote you off?
142,00:07:02.67,00:07:02.67,"-So, why-why can't you... -So, it's like, how do you,"
143,00:07:04.53,00:07:04.53,how do you change it? I don't know.
144,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00,"HEIDI: I'm just saying, we've got a chance to either"
145,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,"go one, two, three or we've got a chance"
146,00:07:09.87,00:07:09.87,to make it to the top three.
147,00:07:11.30,00:07:11.30,"-I mean, you know? -So, what do you want?"
148,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,"HEIDI: I know that  Christy's the wild card,"
149,00:07:14.20,00:07:14.20," so my thing is, is that, okay,"
150,00:07:16.27,00:07:16.27, Christy makes it  to the top four.
151,00:07:18.33,00:07:18.33, But if I can get Christy to  go in with Jenna and myself
152,00:07:22.87,00:07:22.87, and try to vote  one of the boys off--
153,00:07:25.37,00:07:25.37, 'cause they're gonna  vote either me or Jenna off--
154,00:07:27.50,00:07:27.50,"then we stand a 50% chance of staying,"
155,00:07:29.73,00:07:29.73,instead of a zero percent chance of staying.
156,00:07:31.77,00:07:31.77,"So, Christy, you have to think about that."
157,00:07:33.63,00:07:33.63,It's your call.
158,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,-I don't know. I will think about it. -Okay.
159,00:07:36.80,00:07:36.80,"HEIDI: You could come in one, two or three."
160,00:07:38.60,00:07:38.60,"I mean, that's another gamble."
161,00:07:40.23,00:07:40.23,-You see what I'm saying? -Right.
162,00:07:41.23,00:07:41.23,And you just...
163,00:07:42.23,00:07:42.23,See what happens.
164,00:07:43.33,00:07:43.33,(thunder rumbles)
165,00:07:49.10,00:07:49.10,Watch out for big spiders.
166,00:07:50.80,00:07:50.80,Whoa!
167,00:07:54.50,00:07:54.50,I had a long talk with Jenna and Heidi last night.
168,00:07:57.50,00:07:57.50,"And basically, their whole argument is that"
169,00:08:00.77,00:08:00.77,they can't believe that you are
170,00:08:04.33,00:08:04.33,gonna last longer in this game than them.
171,00:08:06.90,00:08:06.90,Yes!
172,00:08:08.03,00:08:08.03,I want to. I-I really want to.
173,00:08:09.97,00:08:09.97,-I feel like I deserve to. -Mm-hmm.
174,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,"Like, seriously, I really want to."
175,00:08:14.17,00:08:14.17,And that's my next challenge.
176,00:08:15.73,00:08:15.73,"Jenna said this, as I was talking to them,"
177,00:08:17.73,00:08:17.73,and she said that they've wor... they've worked
178,00:08:20.67,00:08:20.67,so much harder than you.
179,00:08:22.13,00:08:22.13,I don't think I've ever seen Jenna chop down a tree.
180,00:08:24.67,00:08:24.67,CHRISTY: I think I could  go farther with the girls
181,00:08:27.53,00:08:27.53, than with the guys.
182,00:08:29.40,00:08:29.40," But I like the guys because they're totally honest,"
183,00:08:32.60,00:08:32.60," they're totally cool,  I have more fun with them."
184,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,"And I've been with these girls since day one,"
185,00:08:38.23,00:08:38.23,and I really just...
186,00:08:40.40,00:08:40.40,(groans)
187,00:08:41.70,00:08:41.70,"And I-- what I thought was funny was Heidi's like,"
188,00:08:43.57,00:08:43.57,"""We need to talk."""
189,00:08:45.00,00:08:45.00,"And I'm like, ""So, now you need to talk to me,"" you know?"
190,00:08:48.37,00:08:48.37,"-Yeah. -I mean, if they could"
191,00:08:50.00,00:08:50.00,"at least give me some respect,"
192,00:08:51.73,00:08:51.73,"consideration throughout the whole game,"
193,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,maybe it would have been different.
194,00:08:54.73,00:08:54.73,"So I personally have to decide,"
195,00:08:57.23,00:08:57.23,is it better to win a million dollars
196,00:08:59.13,00:08:59.13,or is it better to be the final girl that kicked butt?
197,00:09:03.07,00:09:03.07,It's such a hard decision.
198,00:09:04.60,00:09:04.60,(chuckles)
199,00:09:05.60,00:09:05.60," Any way, I'm with the power."
200,00:09:07.13,00:09:07.13," It's like, how do you decide?"
201,00:09:08.40,00:09:08.40,All over it.
202,00:09:09.40,00:09:09.40,(spitting)
203,00:09:12.90,00:09:12.90,-Cool. -Cool.
204,00:09:18.33,00:09:18.33,"Come on in, guys!"
205,00:09:21.73,00:09:21.73,All right.
206,00:09:23.57,00:09:23.57,Today's reward challenge is a race.
207,00:09:26.03,00:09:26.03,Your goal is simple:
208,00:09:27.27,00:09:27.27,"collect puzzle pieces, put the puzzle together."
209,00:09:29.87,00:09:29.87,Here's how it works.
210,00:09:31.13,00:09:31.13,"On my go, the six of you"
211,00:09:33.03,00:09:33.03," will race out  to grab four paddles,"
212,00:09:36.43,00:09:36.43,under a series of sandy mounds.
213,00:09:38.03,00:09:38.03, Because there are only
214,00:09:39.23,00:09:39.23,"four paddles and there are six of you,"
215,00:09:41.33,00:09:41.33,two of you will be eliminated right off the top.
216,00:09:44.70,00:09:44.70,"Once you have a paddle, get into one of the four colored canoes."
217,00:09:48.70,00:09:48.70,Paddle out to a color-coded box
218,00:09:50.23,00:09:50.23," that matches your canoe,"
219,00:09:52.00,00:09:52.00, where you will find one  question about the Amazon.
220,00:09:54.83,00:09:54.83,There are four possible answers  to that question.
221,00:09:57.27,00:09:57.27, Each answer corresponds to a colored bag of puzzle pieces.
222,00:10:01.60,00:10:01.60,"Make your choice,"
223,00:10:02.60,00:10:02.60," grab your puzzle pieces,"
224,00:10:03.87,00:10:03.87,paddle over to the other shore.
225,00:10:05.63,00:10:05.63,"Once you're on shore,"
226,00:10:06.80,00:10:06.80, open your puzzle pieces.
227,00:10:08.27,00:10:08.27," If you've answered correctly,"
228,00:10:09.93,00:10:09.93,your puzzle will fit together.
229,00:10:11.47,00:10:11.47,"If you've answered incorrectly,"
230,00:10:13.40,00:10:13.40, you will find  only black pieces of puzzle.
231,00:10:16.27,00:10:16.27,Because there are only
232,00:10:17.43,00:10:17.43," two puzzle stations,"
233,00:10:19.17,00:10:19.17,once two people have the correct puzzle pieces
234,00:10:21.70,00:10:21.70,"and are working on their puzzle,"
235,00:10:23.23,00:10:23.23,the two of you who didn't get a puzzle station are out.
236,00:10:26.13,00:10:26.13,One thing you need to know:
237,00:10:27.43,00:10:27.43, these boats are  native Amazonian boats;
238,00:10:30.37,00:10:30.37, they require some balance.
239,00:10:32.23,00:10:32.23,"If you sink them, you're swimming."
240,00:10:33.90,00:10:33.90, You might want to think  twice about that.
241,00:10:36.37,00:10:36.37,First person
242,00:10:38.57,00:10:38.57,to correctly solve their puzzle  wins reward.
243,00:10:41.80,00:10:41.80,One of you will win a visit from your loved one.
244,00:10:48.60,00:10:48.60,"Take your positions, wait for my go."
245,00:10:51.43,00:10:51.43,Give it all you got.
246,00:10:53.93,00:10:53.93,For a visit from a loved one.
247,00:10:55.20,00:10:55.20,"Survivors, ready?"
248,00:10:56.47,00:10:56.47,Go!
249,00:10:58.17,00:10:58.17,First four paddles are moving onto a boat.
250,00:11:03.53,00:11:03.53,"Rob's got one, Jenna's got one,"
251,00:11:06.20,00:11:06.20,"Matthew has one, and Christy has one."
252,00:11:08.77,00:11:08.77,Butch and Heidi are out.
253,00:11:16.17,00:11:16.17,Matthew's off to a good start.
254,00:11:18.67,00:11:18.67,Jenna's going to swim it.
255,00:11:21.20,00:11:21.20,"Got your work cut out for you, Jenna."
256,00:11:24.00,00:11:24.00,Rob's still having trouble.
257,00:11:25.47,00:11:25.47,His boat is down.
258,00:11:27.50,00:11:27.50,Christy's out of her boat.
259,00:11:29.30,00:11:29.30,She's swimming.
260,00:11:33.23,00:11:33.23,Rob went back and got back in his boat.
261,00:11:35.37,00:11:35.37,Matthew has a big advantage if he guesses the correct answer.
262,00:11:41.90,00:11:41.90,Matthew's made his choice; he's heading to the shore.
263,00:11:46.90,00:11:46.90,"Matthew around the bend, heading down the home stretch."
264,00:11:52.27,00:11:52.27,Jenna and Christy have their bags.
265,00:11:54.67,00:11:54.67,Matthew's command of the boat a big advantage in this.
266,00:11:59.47,00:11:59.47,Rob has his bag.
267,00:12:11.80,00:12:11.80,He's got the right answer.
268,00:12:13.93,00:12:13.93,Just a matter of solving the puzzle.
269,00:12:18.57,00:12:18.57,Keep moving!
270,00:12:19.57,00:12:19.57,"You got a shot, Christy!"
271,00:12:20.63,00:12:20.63,"Keep swimming, guys!"
272,00:12:27.43,00:12:27.43,He's heading in.
273,00:12:29.10,00:12:29.10,"Let's go, Rob!"
274,00:12:30.10,00:12:30.10,Matthew still only halfway through.
275,00:12:32.23,00:12:32.23,Rob's sneaking up on your tail.
276,00:12:35.00,00:12:35.00,You got a shot.

294,00:13:17.23,00:13:17.23,"As a philosophy, would you say it is better"
295,00:13:19.40,00:13:19.40,to give or to receive?
296,00:13:21.50,00:13:21.50,It's better to give.

411,00:17:24.57,00:17:24.57, Followed the torchlight  to a clearing.
412,00:17:27.10,00:17:27.10, There was a table  covered with food and drink.
413,00:17:30.87,00:17:30.87,"Let's see what we've got, Mom."
414,00:17:32.60,00:17:32.60,-Let's inspect. -Let's see.
415,00:17:33.63,00:17:33.63,Wow.
416,00:17:34.63,00:17:34.63,-Look. -(both gasp)
417,00:17:36.53,00:17:36.53,-Fish. -Yes.
418,00:17:38.27,00:17:38.27,And chicken!
419,00:17:39.93,00:17:39.93,"Oh, I haven't had fried chicken in so long."
420,00:17:41.53,00:17:41.53,(chuckles)
421,00:17:42.53,00:17:42.53,"Got some-- Oh, look at this."
422,00:17:44.10,00:17:44.10, We admired the buffet.
423,00:17:45.43,00:17:45.43,This is great.
424,00:17:47.43,00:17:47.43,"Just the two of us, Mom."
425,00:17:48.53,00:17:48.53,It's going to be a romantic evening.
426,00:17:49.70,00:17:49.70, My relationship  with my mom is great.
427,00:17:53.57,00:17:53.57,It's not the conventional mother-son relationship.
428,00:17:55.77,00:17:55.77,My mom is tough.
429,00:17:57.37,00:17:57.37, My mom is independent.
430,00:17:58.83,00:17:58.83,We've missed you awfully.
431,00:18:00.60,00:18:00.60,"-Have you? -Yeah, of course."
432,00:18:01.93,00:18:01.93,I talk to you at home.
433,00:18:03.23,00:18:03.23,"Even if I don't see you, I talk to you."
434,00:18:05.37,00:18:05.37,"No, I like that."
435,00:18:07.93,00:18:07.93,-Mm-hmm. -Appreciate it.
436,00:18:09.10,00:18:09.10,Don't be too formal.
437,00:18:10.43,00:18:10.43,Am I too formal?
438,00:18:11.43,00:18:11.43,Just a bit.
439,00:18:15.50,00:18:15.50,-Champagne? -Are we making manioc?
440,00:18:17.03,00:18:17.03,"-Yeah. -Yeah, making so much. -\xe2\x99\xaa Rock on, baby. \xe2\x99\xaa"
441,00:18:19.27,00:18:19.27,"Anybody can blow on the fire, that would help me immensely."
442,00:18:22.30,00:18:22.30,"Yeah, let's start with me."
443,00:18:23.37,00:18:23.37,We having a bathing suit party yet?
444,00:18:25.50,00:18:25.50,This is the best reward I've ever had.
445,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,I got my foot stuck in the tree.
446,00:18:29.87,00:18:29.87,ROB: Everybody was just in such  a good mood and not thinking
447,00:18:32.57,00:18:32.57, about the game so much  after seeing their family.
448,00:18:35.03,00:18:35.03,I am really glad I got to see your loved ones.
449,00:18:37.93,00:18:37.93,"Like, seeing Cindy run to Butch was like..."
450,00:18:40.37,00:18:40.37,"ROB: Yeah, I feel so much closer."
451,00:18:41.93,00:18:41.93,"Boy, I'll tell you what, when I saw her walk across,"
452,00:18:44.03,00:18:44.03,I just wanted to see her and hug her.
453,00:18:46.10,00:18:46.10,"It made you, also, what?"
454,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,-Feel good. -CHRISTY: Good.
455,00:18:49.33,00:18:49.33,And that's what life's all about.
456,00:18:51.30,00:18:51.30,ROB: Butch was an absolute disaster.
457,00:18:53.53,00:18:53.53,"I don't know how much wine he drank,"
458,00:18:55.33,00:18:55.33, but he just got crazy.
459,00:18:57.30,00:18:57.30,"Okay, you are going straight to where?"
460,00:18:59.97,00:18:59.97,It's so dry here.
461,00:19:01.10,00:19:01.10,Okay.
462,00:19:02.10,00:19:02.10,"I was, like, ""Mom, I haven't"
463,00:19:03.23,00:19:03.23,"-taken a shower in 31 days."" -Yeah."
464,00:19:05.20,00:19:05.20,I showed my dad my hairy legs.
465,00:19:07.07,00:19:07.07,ROB: We had about  five bottles of wine.
466,00:19:08.63,00:19:08.63," I'm wearing a Speedo, the girls are in their bikinis."
467,00:19:11.53,00:19:11.53,It's like a rap video.
468,00:19:12.90,00:19:12.90,(retching)
469,00:19:17.27,00:19:17.27,"Pass the wine, baby."
470,00:19:18.93,00:19:18.93,ROB: Why does it smell like ... over here?
471,00:19:20.57,00:19:20.57,It's probably throw up.
472,00:19:21.93,00:19:21.93,"ROB: We'd been drinking for a  while, and there was"
473,00:19:23.93,00:19:23.93, a couple people that had to  go to bed
474,00:19:25.20,00:19:25.20, 'cause they were too drunk.  And I have a feeling
475,00:19:27.47,00:19:27.47,"that at least one of those two people,"
476,00:19:29.23,00:19:29.23,"uh, soiled themselves."
477,00:19:31.43,00:19:31.43,"HEIDI: I mean, it is so bad, I'm about ready to gag."
478,00:19:34.00,00:19:34.00,I haven't smelled a worse smell in 31 days.
479,00:19:36.10,00:19:36.10,(laughter)
480,00:19:37.10,00:19:37.10,HEIDI: Crap!
481,00:19:38.23,00:19:38.23,I can't handle that.
482,00:19:41.20,00:19:41.20,Just one more forkful of beans and rice.
483,00:19:45.10,00:19:45.10,It's so quiet.
484,00:19:46.93,00:19:46.93,-(soft rustling) -What is that?
485,00:19:48.33,00:19:48.33,I don't know.
486,00:19:50.07,00:19:50.07,You hear them?
487,00:19:52.23,00:19:52.23,"Look, look, look, look."
488,00:19:55.13,00:19:55.13,MATTHEW: There was some sort of Indian tribe coming towards us.
489,00:19:58.67,00:19:58.67,(men singing in native language)
490,00:20:06.57,00:20:06.57,(playing melody on reed instruments)
491,00:20:12.00,00:20:12.00, They put on  an amazing performance.
492,00:20:27.20,00:20:27.20, My mom and I  were just mesmerized.
493,00:20:28.90,00:20:28.90, Their dancing was hypnotic.
494,00:20:32.00,00:20:32.00,The music was hypnotic.
495,00:20:36.23,00:20:36.23,(men shouting in foreign language)
496,00:20:38.10,00:20:38.10, It was just a great way  to end the evening.
497,00:20:39.57,00:20:39.57, And my mom and I--
498,00:20:41.13,00:20:41.13,"we marched out, followed the same path to the water."
499,00:20:44.53,00:20:44.53,"Oh, that was fabulous, huh?"
500,00:20:45.93,00:20:45.93,"-Mommy. -I love you, babes."
501,00:20:47.33,00:20:47.33,I hate to see you go.
502,00:20:48.70,00:20:48.70,"Hey, have a great trip back."
503,00:20:49.93,00:20:49.93," I gave her a hug,  I gave her a kiss,"
504,00:20:51.80,00:20:51.80, and she wished me the best  for the rest of the game.
505,00:20:54.03,00:20:54.03,Bye-bye.
506,00:20:55.30,00:20:55.30,It was an incredible experience  for my mom.
507,00:20:56.93,00:20:56.93,It was an incredible experience for me.
508,00:21:00.07,00:21:00.07,Bye-bye.
509,00:21:01.10,00:21:01.10,Go for it.
510,00:21:05.40,00:21:05.40,ROB: I'm just happy that tonight we got a chance to
511,00:21:08.23,00:21:08.23,"just hang out like we're, like we're normal."
512,00:21:09.47,00:21:09.47,Like old times.
513,00:21:11.17,00:21:11.17,-Tonight... -We are normal.
514,00:21:12.40,00:21:12.40,-The game makes us abnormal. -HEIDI: It does.
515,00:21:13.87,00:21:13.87,ROB: I really used last night  as an opportunity
516,00:21:15.80,00:21:15.80," to kiss and make up  with the girls,"
517,00:21:17.87,00:21:17.87, because I knew  that they hate my guts.
518,00:21:20.60,00:21:20.60,And I want them just to remember all the fun we had
519,00:21:23.23,00:21:23.23,and not all the bad things I did to them.
520,00:21:25.47,00:21:25.47,I don't know why people dwell on the negative.
521,00:21:28.03,00:21:28.03,\xe2\x99\xaa I know your plans \xe2\x99\xaa
522,00:21:30.67,00:21:30.67,"Oh, good song."
523,00:21:31.67,00:21:31.67,"\xe2\x99\xaa Doo, doo, doo \xe2\x99\xaa"
524,00:21:33.50,00:21:33.50,\xe2\x99\xaa Don't include me \xe2\x99\xaa
525,00:21:36.30,00:21:36.30,"-I love this song. -\xe2\x99\xaa Doo, doo, doo, doo \xe2\x99\xaa"
526,00:21:39.03,00:21:39.03,\xe2\x99\xaa We've got tonight \xe2\x99\xaa
527,00:21:41.50,00:21:41.50,"\xe2\x99\xaa Doo, doo, doo \xe2\x99\xaa"
528,00:21:43.63,00:21:43.63,\xe2\x99\xaa Why don't you stay? \xe2\x99\xaa
529,00:22:01.67,00:22:01.67,"ROB:  In this game,"
530,00:22:04.17,00:22:04.17, you want to be standing  next to somebody at the end
531,00:22:06.63,00:22:06.63," that's more disagreeable than  yourself, and I had planned on"
532,00:22:10.00,00:22:10.00," going to the end of the game  with Matthew, and I thought"
533,00:22:12.23,00:22:12.23,that I would be able to beat him 'cause he's a spaz.
534,00:22:14.60,00:22:14.60," But now,  after Matthew yesterday"
535,00:22:16.53,00:22:16.53, won the challenge  and gave everybody
536,00:22:18.90,00:22:18.90," their visit from home--  and for the record,"
537,00:22:22.53,00:22:22.53,everybody would've done that.
538,00:22:23.70,00:22:23.70,It's not like this guy is
539,00:22:25.07,00:22:25.07,the p-patron saint of reward challenges.
540,00:22:27.30,00:22:27.30, But I'm beginning to  seriously doubt whether
541,00:22:30.00,00:22:30.00," he's a beatable opponent  anymore, and I may have to"
542,00:22:32.63,00:22:32.63,cut him off before the final two.
543,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,"I told my mom yesterday,"
544,00:22:41.70,00:22:41.70,"I said, ""Mom,"" I said, ""I think I'll get to the final two,"
545,00:22:44.67,00:22:44.67,"""but I've done a lot of bad things"
546,00:22:46.67,00:22:46.67,"and I don't think I can win."""
547,00:22:48.47,00:22:48.47,"So, at this time, if I decide to do this,"
548,00:22:51.67,00:22:51.67,I've thought this all the way through of how it's going to be
549,00:22:54.43,00:22:54.43,me and you in the... in the final two.
550,00:22:55.90,00:22:55.90,(chuckles)
551,00:22:57.23,00:22:57.23,I think that you've rubbed a lot of people
552,00:22:59.57,00:22:59.57,"the... the wrong way in this game,"
553,00:23:01.83,00:23:01.83,but you'd get Alex's vote and-and Heidi's vote.
554,00:23:04.83,00:23:04.83,Mm-hmm.
555,00:23:06.00,00:23:06.00,And then the other five would be up for grabs.
556,00:23:07.63,00:23:07.63,-Mm-hmm. -But that's still five up for...
557,00:23:09.33,00:23:09.33,"Butch-- but Matt would probably definitely go for you, though."
558,00:23:11.37,00:23:11.37,"Well, the thing is, I'd have to screw both of them over."
559,00:23:14.07,00:23:14.07,Mm-hmm.
560,00:23:15.07,00:23:15.07,But after Heidi goes--
561,00:23:17.10,00:23:17.10,"and the more I'm thinking about this,"
562,00:23:18.27,00:23:18.27,"the more, the more I want to do it."
563,00:23:19.80,00:23:19.80,-This is how... -Who after?
564,00:23:21.53,00:23:21.53,"Well, I don't want to, I don't want to,"
565,00:23:23.53,00:23:23.53,"-uh, reveal all that at this point. -I mean, 'cause..."
566,00:23:25.47,00:23:25.47,-That's fine. -'Cause there's nothing
567,00:23:26.87,00:23:26.87,stopping you from going back to the group
568,00:23:28.87,00:23:28.87,-and telling everybody. -And telling them what you said.
569,00:23:30.63,00:23:30.63,"Even if-if you were to go back and tell them,"
570,00:23:32.73,00:23:32.73,the only thing I've said in this conversation is that I think
571,00:23:36.90,00:23:36.90,the person that I could stand the best chance
572,00:23:38.83,00:23:38.83,at the end of the game with is you.
573,00:23:42.07,00:23:42.07,He's a snake.
574,00:23:43.53,00:23:43.53,"Everybody's going to know that, and it's embarrassing."
575,00:23:45.90,00:23:45.90,"I would be embarrassed to know him,"
576,00:23:47.43,00:23:47.43,because he's such a slime ball.
577,00:23:48.90,00:23:48.90,What are we going to do?
578,00:23:51.43,00:23:51.43,He's going to take everybody out except me and him.
579,00:23:54.13,00:23:54.13,He's going to-- 'cause he feels like
580,00:23:56.23,00:23:56.23,most people on the jury don't like me.
581,00:23:58.77,00:23:58.77,And like him more.
582,00:24:00.23,00:24:00.23,What do you want to do?
583,00:24:01.63,00:24:01.63,Take him out.
584,00:24:02.97,00:24:02.97,"I mean, he-he won't tell me anything else, other than"
585,00:24:05.60,00:24:05.60,"about you, because he doesn't want me to go back"
586,00:24:07.47,00:24:07.47,"and say anything, but..."
587,00:24:09.63,00:24:09.63,JENNA: He is like a puppet  master with his other--
588,00:24:12.07,00:24:12.07, the people in his alliance.
589,00:24:13.73,00:24:13.73, He's just cutting the strings  off them as he goes along.
590,00:24:16.03,00:24:16.03," I have morals,  and I have ethics."
591,00:24:17.87,00:24:17.87,"He has none at all,"
592,00:24:19.67,00:24:19.67,and I refuse to go along with his crappy plan.
593,00:24:22.33,00:24:22.33,"HEIDI: That's why I'm glad that I'm getting taken out,"
594,00:24:25.40,00:24:25.40,"because that way, I'm not up against five snakes, you know?"
595,00:24:28.10,00:24:28.10,"And if you want-want to call me a snake, I'm not..."
596,00:24:30.00,00:24:30.00,"-I'm not insulted in the least. -No, I'm just saying..."
597,00:24:31.70,00:24:31.70,-You can go ahead. -I'm just saying. I know.
598,00:24:32.93,00:24:32.93,You have to ... people over to win this game; I know you do.
599,00:24:34.50,00:24:34.50,-I knew what I needed to do coming into this game. -I know.
600,00:24:36.73,00:24:36.73,"-I know you did, and that's what you're doing. -And..."
601,00:24:38.20,00:24:38.20,-Yesterday... -And that's-that's fine.
602,00:24:39.50,00:24:39.50,"...getting to see my mom, I told her."
603,00:24:41.30,00:24:41.30,"I said, ""Mom, I've done a lot of bad things."""
604,00:24:43.80,00:24:43.80,"And she said, ""Way to go."""
605,00:24:46.47,00:24:46.47,'Cause she knew that was what I had to do when I came out here.
606,00:24:48.73,00:24:48.73,"I know, and that's where our morals are different."
607,00:24:50.37,00:24:50.37,'Cause I told my mom I played really good and I gave up
608,00:24:52.83,00:24:52.83,a lot of stuff for other people.
609,00:24:56.67,00:24:56.67,Are you okay? Please don't walk away mad.
610,00:24:59.43,00:24:59.43,"ROB:  Now with the two girls,"
611,00:25:03.60,00:25:03.60, it's kind of like I'm hanging  out with two ex-girlfriends
612,00:25:07.00,00:25:07.00,at the same time that both hate me.
613,00:25:08.50,00:25:08.50,JENNA: What's the problem?
614,00:25:09.93,00:25:09.93,"ROB: And there's, like, this whole weird vibe going on,"
615,00:25:12.97,00:25:12.97, and they think I'm a jerk.
616,00:25:14.50,00:25:14.50,"But I'm sorry, I am a jerk,"
617,00:25:16.40,00:25:16.40,and you just didn't realize it for 31 days.
618,00:25:18.73,00:25:18.73,"See, now, this is where I draw the line on this game."
619,00:25:21.83,00:25:21.83,This is really where I draw the line.
620,00:25:24.00,00:25:24.00,"-It's fine, it's fine. -No, it's not fine."
621,00:25:26.07,00:25:26.07,"What, well, what is it exactly that, uh..."
622,00:25:27.97,00:25:27.97,I'm drawing the line on your bull ... everybody.
623,00:25:30.77,00:25:30.77,This isn't right anymore.
624,00:25:32.33,00:25:32.33,I'm sorry that I'm trying-- that I want to vote Heidi off.
625,00:25:35.50,00:25:35.50,"-No, it's not that. -I thought we were playing Survivor."
626,00:25:36.77,00:25:36.77,You're lying to everybody.
627,00:25:38.30,00:25:38.30,What did you... Have you told Christy your plan?
628,00:25:40.80,00:25:40.80,Have you told everybody else
629,00:25:42.20,00:25:42.20,that you want to take me to the end
630,00:25:43.90,00:25:43.90,"'cause I'm the only one you can beat? No, you haven't."
631,00:25:45.93,00:25:45.93,-And you know you said it. -(groans)
632,00:25:51.67,00:25:51.67,I don't understand how you can lie
633,00:25:52.80,00:25:52.80,to all these people on a regular basis.
634,00:25:54.10,00:25:54.10,Did you ever think that I was lying to you?
635,00:25:56.10,00:25:56.10,"Well, then that wouldn't surprise me."
636,00:25:57.90,00:25:57.90,Then why wouldn't everybody else think that you've lied to them?
637,00:26:00.80,00:26:00.80,ROB: I told every person in this game...
638,00:26:02.13,00:26:02.13,JENNA: A different story.
639,00:26:03.17,00:26:03.17,ROB: ...that I have told lies in this game.
640,00:26:04.93,00:26:04.93,JENNA: This is the point; you don't care about
641,00:26:07.23,00:26:07.23,"personal relationships, you just care about yourself."
642,00:26:09.10,00:26:09.10,I'm sorry that I was playing the same game th-that you are.
643,00:26:12.70,00:26:12.70,"I know, but you know what the difference is?"
644,00:26:14.90,00:26:14.90,I care about my personal relationships too much.
645,00:26:17.40,00:26:17.40,"We are... we are playing the same game as you, Rob,"
646,00:26:19.27,00:26:19.27,but we didn't ... everybody over.
647,00:26:20.97,00:26:20.97,"ROB: If you do not like the way I play this game,"
648,00:26:23.30,00:26:23.30,"please feel free to write ""R-O-B"""
649,00:26:25.67,00:26:25.67,on your parchment tomorrow night.
650,00:26:27.33,00:26:27.33,JENNA: Where-Where does Matt think
651,00:26:28.47,00:26:28.47,he stands with-with this alliance?
652,00:26:29.73,00:26:29.73,Does he think that he's going to be in the final two with you?
653,00:26:32.13,00:26:32.13,-Huh? -Does Butch think he's gonna be
654,00:26:34.17,00:26:34.17,-in the final two with you? -The four of us think we're
655,00:26:35.93,00:26:35.93,-going to be in the final four. -We don't have a final two.
656,00:26:38.10,00:26:38.10,"Okay, but-but that's not the plan I got from you."
657,00:26:39.93,00:26:39.93,"I mean, you can't really care about us, you can't."
658,00:26:42.33,00:26:42.33,"He doesn't, that's it. That's what he said."
659,00:26:43.93,00:26:43.93,-It's a game. -And that's what makes me the maddest.
660,00:26:45.57,00:26:45.57,That's what we're here to do.
661,00:26:47.40,00:26:47.40,And you're kidding yourself by-by
662,00:26:49.03,00:26:49.03,trying to make it like I'm the bad guy here.
663,00:26:51.03,00:26:51.03,"I'm not going to be nice, and I'm not gonna be friendly,"
664,00:26:53.27,00:26:53.27,and I'm not gonna be easy to work with.
665,00:26:55.03,00:26:55.03,And I... I'll do... I'll try and make your life miserable.
666,00:26:57.73,00:26:57.73,HEIDI: It's totally fine.
667,00:26:58.73,00:26:58.73,This is not real life.
668,00:27:00.23,00:27:00.23,"This is a game, this is how you play."
669,00:27:02.37,00:27:02.37,"I don't like the way you play,"
670,00:27:03.70,00:27:03.70,but that-- you are getting ahead.
671,00:27:05.23,00:27:05.23,"I mean, that's-that's how it's going to be."
672,00:27:06.93,00:27:06.93,"I don't think Matt would go there,"
673,00:27:08.83,00:27:08.83,"we wouldn't go there, Butch has never gone there,"
674,00:27:11.20,00:27:11.20,Christy's never gone there.
675,00:27:12.43,00:27:12.43,"You're the only one that has gone there, and that..."
676,00:27:15.47,00:27:15.47,and you'll win the game if you continue to screw everybody.
677,00:27:37.00,00:27:37.00," ROB: Basically, I am  an alliance of one."
678,00:27:41.13,00:27:41.13,"I am a lone wolf in this game,"
679,00:27:44.10,00:27:44.10,"a mercenary, if you will."
680,00:27:46.37,00:27:46.37, I just pick up  the bottom feeders as I go.
681,00:27:48.97,00:27:48.97, They go with me  because I promise them
682,00:27:51.70,00:27:51.70, the dream of  getting to the end.
683,00:27:55.37,00:27:55.37, I have told lies in this game.
684,00:27:57.63,00:27:57.63, I have lied to people.
685,00:27:59.07,00:27:59.07, I have broken promises.
686,00:28:00.30,00:28:00.30, And I... they all know that.
687,00:28:01.70,00:28:01.70, And maybe that's why  they still trust me.
688,00:28:03.73,00:28:03.73,Everybody tells me all the time how much they believe me
689,00:28:05.60,00:28:05.60,and how much they trust me.
690,00:28:06.83,00:28:06.83,Were these guys paying attention the first 32 days?
691,00:28:08.67,00:28:08.67,"When-When-When you came up there before,"
692,00:28:10.10,00:28:10.10,I was talking to Jenna about...
693,00:28:11.27,00:28:11.27,BUTCH: I know exactly what you were doing.
694,00:28:12.87,00:28:12.87,What you did was you-you stood there and took some of it
695,00:28:15.20,00:28:15.20,'cause they were hot and they're mad at you.
696,00:28:16.93,00:28:16.93,They're cussing you and they're doing
697,00:28:18.30,00:28:18.30,all that kind of-- but that's too bad.
698,00:28:20.03,00:28:20.03,And they have the right to write your name down on-on the card.
699,00:28:22.63,00:28:22.63,-Mm-hmm. -Just as we're going to write
700,00:28:23.93,00:28:23.93,one of their names down on the card.
701,00:28:25.43,00:28:25.43,-Mm-hmm. -And that's the way it's going to be.
702,00:28:26.77,00:28:26.77,-Good. -Okay?
703,00:28:27.77,00:28:27.77,-Are we on? -What are you--
704,00:28:29.70,00:28:29.70,"Hey, you don't have a free hand."
705,00:28:31.17,00:28:31.17,I know.
706,00:28:33.43,00:28:33.43,They're trying to make it sound like
707,00:28:34.63,00:28:34.63,you guys are cooking something against me.
708,00:28:36.63,00:28:36.63,"Now, what the ... are they talking about?"
709,00:28:38.10,00:28:38.10,They're trying everything.
710,00:28:39.53,00:28:39.53,They're trying to get Christy. They're trying...
711,00:28:41.23,00:28:41.23,Any changes at all? Any conversations this morning
712,00:28:43.43,00:28:43.43,-that I have to worry about? -No.
713,00:28:45.03,00:28:45.03,-Nothing? -Nothing.
714,00:28:46.03,00:28:46.03,Jenna...
715,00:28:47.07,00:28:47.07,Christy is obviously still with us.
716,00:28:48.07,00:28:48.07,-Mm-hmm. -That's beautiful.
717,00:28:52.63,00:28:52.63,CHRISTY: I think that Matt and Butch have been
718,00:28:54.83,00:28:54.83,"-honest, you know? -HEIDI: Yeah, honest."
719,00:28:56.67,00:28:56.67,They have been honest.
720,00:28:57.70,00:28:57.70,HEIDI: And how bad do you want to win?
721,00:28:59.43,00:28:59.43,"But I have been, too."
722,00:29:00.90,00:29:00.90,"So it's not like you're going with a snake, either."
723,00:29:02.73,00:29:02.73,"-CHRISTY: Right. -I'm just saying,"
724,00:29:04.13,00:29:04.13,"right now, if you don't go with us,"
725,00:29:06.07,00:29:06.07,"you're going to get voted off third, okay?"
726,00:29:07.73,00:29:07.73,"-Right, right. -And that's-that's the general..."
727,00:29:09.40,00:29:09.40,"-Right. -But if you do go with us,"
728,00:29:10.90,00:29:10.90,you have a good possibility in getting one or two.
729,00:29:13.37,00:29:13.37,-Right? -And I-I don't know.
730,00:29:14.60,00:29:14.60,I still can't believe about the fact that
731,00:29:16.13,00:29:16.13,-you want to put me up second. -Why?
732,00:29:17.60,00:29:17.60,-Even though you guys want the money more than I do. -Why?
733,00:29:19.70,00:29:19.70,-No... -I don't know.
734,00:29:20.80,00:29:20.80,"I-I just, I can't grasp that concept."
735,00:29:24.03,00:29:24.03,"I'm still not trying to say,"
736,00:29:26.50,00:29:26.50,"""Okay, what can make me believe?"""
737,00:29:28.20,00:29:28.20,"-I doubt that, you know? -I know."
738,00:29:29.80,00:29:29.80,"But I mean, who-who the hell can I trust in this game, too?"
739,00:29:31.87,00:29:31.87,"And I'm having to put all my trust in you, Christy,"
740,00:29:33.87,00:29:33.87,-if I win. -How do I believe Jenna?
741,00:29:35.37,00:29:35.37,How do I believe Jenna?
742,00:29:36.57,00:29:36.57,-I've never trusted Jenna. -I know.
743,00:29:38.10,00:29:38.10,"Honestly, if I never trust Jenna, how can I believe that?"
744,00:29:41.43,00:29:41.43,And-And I understand that.
745,00:29:42.97,00:29:42.97,"CHRISTY: Heidi and Jenna--  they do kiss my ass,"
746,00:29:46.60,00:29:46.60,"but they just want something from me,"
747,00:29:48.00,00:29:48.00,so why would I want to give them something
748,00:29:49.67,00:29:49.67,if Heidi and Jenna hasn't done anything in return?
749,00:29:52.73,00:29:52.73,"-So, I mean... -I-I'm still thinking about it."
750,00:29:54.47,00:29:54.47,"-I know, I know. I'm just saying. -I don't know."
751,00:29:56.10,00:29:56.10,"-It's, like, a big decision. -It is a big decision."
752,00:29:57.60,00:29:57.60,"So their trick, ""I need to talk to you."""
753,00:29:59.53,00:29:59.53,"I'm like, ""Well, since when have you ever"
754,00:30:01.27,00:30:01.27,"wanted to talk to me, you know?"""
755,00:30:03.10,00:30:03.10,Just because I have the power.
756,00:30:10.83,00:30:10.83,"Come on in, guys."
757,00:30:14.07,00:30:14.07,Welcome.
758,00:30:15.47,00:30:15.47,First things first.
759,00:30:16.83,00:30:16.83,"Rob, got to take it back."
760,00:30:22.10,00:30:22.10,"Once again, the all-important immunity back up for grabs."
761,00:30:25.97,00:30:25.97,Today's immunity challenge plays in two rounds.
762,00:30:28.37,00:30:28.37," In the first round,  you will each have"
763,00:30:29.83,00:30:29.83, a slingshot and ten marbles.
764,00:30:31.57,00:30:31.57, Your goal: break as many of  your own plates as you can.
765,00:30:34.93,00:30:34.93," Each time you break a plate,  you release a puck."
766,00:30:37.73,00:30:37.73," The more plates you break,  the more pucks you have."
767,00:30:40.40,00:30:40.40, You'll then collect your pucks
768,00:30:41.63,00:30:41.63," and move to  our Survivor shuffleboard,"
769,00:30:42.97,00:30:42.97,where you will slide your pucks  across the board
770,00:30:44.93,00:30:44.93, with one very simple goal.
771,00:30:46.97,00:30:46.97, The Survivor  whose puck is closest

775,00:30:55.77,00:30:55.77,Good stakes?
776,00:30:57.47,00:30:57.47,"Pick a slingshot, let's go."
777,00:31:03.07,00:31:03.07,Okay. Here we go.
778,00:31:04.57,00:31:04.57,"Ready, aim, fire."

785,00:31:21.03,00:31:21.03,-Who...? -That was me.
786,00:31:22.53,00:31:22.53,"Butch, the object is to hit your plates."
787,00:31:25.23,00:31:25.23,"Survivors, ready, aim, fire."
788,00:31:30.27,00:31:30.27,Yes!

790,00:31:33.57,00:31:33.57,Fire.
791,00:31:36.83,00:31:36.83,Heidi with one.
792,00:31:40.43,00:31:40.43,-Okay. -A little help from Matt.
793,00:31:42.10,00:31:42.10,Jenna gets two more.
794,00:31:44.03,00:31:44.03,"Ready, aim, fire."
795,00:31:49.90,00:31:49.90,-Damn. -Oh.
796,00:31:51.93,00:31:51.93,I haven't broke this many dishes since I was a waiter.
797,00:31:53.77,00:31:53.77,Gather your pucks. We'll move on to the next round.
798,00:31:55.37,00:31:55.37,Here's where we're at.
799,00:31:56.97,00:31:56.97,Jenna and Butch have five;
800,00:31:58.67,00:31:58.67,"Heidi, you've got four; Christy, three; Rob, two;"
801,00:32:01.17,00:32:01.17,"Matthew, just one."
802,00:32:03.07,00:32:03.07,Round one of shuffleboard begins.
803,00:32:05.17,00:32:05.17,"Butch, you drew first; you're up."
804,00:32:07.73,00:32:07.73,Take one of your five pucks and give it a slide.
805,00:32:09.97,00:32:09.97,"-Let's go, Butchy. -You're looking to get"
806,00:32:11.37,00:32:11.37,"as close to the center of the ""X."""
807,00:32:16.83,00:32:16.83,Not a bad first toss.
808,00:32:18.40,00:32:18.40,Rob only has two pucks.
809,00:32:24.73,00:32:24.73,Getting a feel of the board.
810,00:32:30.43,00:32:30.43,"Strategy, or just a weak toss?"
811,00:32:33.17,00:32:33.17,Jenna with a big stack of pucks.
812,00:32:37.63,00:32:37.63,Knocks Christy out of the way.
813,00:32:39.10,00:32:39.10,"Heidi with four, using one of her first pucks."
814,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,Hmm.
815,00:32:44.40,00:32:44.40,Matthew has but one puck.
816,00:32:45.73,00:32:45.73,"You get one shot at this ""X."""
817,00:32:49.77,00:32:49.77,"Oh, my."
818,00:32:51.40,00:32:51.40,"Matthew moves his puck closest to the ""X"" for the time being."
819,00:32:54.57,00:32:54.57,"-Only one, guys. -Next round, Butch."
820,00:32:57.63,00:32:57.63,"Good job, Butch."
821,00:32:58.87,00:32:58.87,"Butch knocks Matthew out,"
822,00:33:00.90,00:33:00.90,-puts himself closer. -Out.
823,00:33:02.40,00:33:02.40,Matthew's out of the game.
824,00:33:03.77,00:33:03.77,"Rob, this is your last puck."
825,00:33:07.77,00:33:07.77,Oh.
826,00:33:09.37,00:33:09.37,"I think Rob just slid into first place with that,"
827,00:33:11.67,00:33:11.67,"knocking Butch out, but Rob is out of pucks."
828,00:33:13.97,00:33:13.97,Christy.
829,00:33:16.63,00:33:16.63,Christy's still getting a feel of the board.
830,00:33:18.37,00:33:18.37,Jenna.
831,00:33:20.03,00:33:20.03,Jenna slides into the lead.
832,00:33:26.13,00:33:26.13,Butch looking at immunity.
833,00:33:28.13,00:33:28.13,Matthew and Rob out of the game.
834,00:33:29.83,00:33:29.83,We go to Christy.
835,00:33:35.03,00:33:35.03,-Ooh. -Jenna protects her lead
836,00:33:36.07,00:33:36.07,by knocking Butch out of the way.
837,00:33:37.93,00:33:37.93,"Right now, Jenna closest to the ""X."""
838,00:33:42.40,00:33:42.40,"And Heidi just knocked Rob into immunity,"
839,00:33:45.87,00:33:45.87,knocking Jenna out of immunity.
840,00:33:47.23,00:33:47.23,"Rob now closest, and he's protected by Heidi."
841,00:33:49.60,00:33:49.60,"What are you going to do, Butch?"
842,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,"Let's see if I can hit Jenna's, bounce back, stay right there."
843,00:33:53.60,00:33:53.60,How's that sound?
844,00:33:54.93,00:33:54.93,(chuckles)
845,00:33:59.10,00:33:59.10,Just like you planned!
846,00:34:01.07,00:34:01.07,Butch looking at immunity.
847,00:34:02.97,00:34:02.97,"Christy, your last puck, make it a good one."
848,00:34:06.73,00:34:06.73,Oh!
849,00:34:08.07,00:34:08.07,Christy knocks everybody out.
850,00:34:10.13,00:34:10.13,Rob is now sitting closest to immunity.
851,00:34:12.53,00:34:12.53,Jenna.
852,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,Damn it.
853,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,"PROBST: Heidi, this is your last puck."
854,00:34:17.87,00:34:17.87,HEIDI: Oh.
855,00:34:19.03,00:34:19.03,PROBST: It's between Butch and Jenna.
856,00:34:20.47,00:34:20.47,"Butch, this is your last puck."
857,00:34:22.10,00:34:22.10,Rob is currently looking at immunity.
858,00:34:26.43,00:34:26.43,(Butch groans)
859,00:34:27.70,00:34:27.70,"Heidi is closest to the center of the ""X"" right now."
860,00:34:29.70,00:34:29.70,"Jenna, here's the deal."
861,00:34:31.30,00:34:31.30,Heidi's currently sitting on immunity.
862,00:34:32.97,00:34:32.97,You have one puck left.
863,00:34:34.43,00:34:34.43,What you have to think about is how you're going to use it--
864,00:34:37.00,00:34:37.00,offensively or defensively.
865,00:34:39.07,00:34:39.07,I have my own plans.
866,00:34:40.77,00:34:40.77,Secret.
867,00:34:45.30,00:34:45.30,"Well, it worked."
868,00:34:47.13,00:34:47.13,"Jenna knocks Heidi and Rob out of the game, wins immunity."
869,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,Nice job. You are safe from the vote tonight.
870,00:34:52.13,00:34:52.13,You cannot be voted out.
871,00:34:53.73,00:34:53.73,Everybody else is fair game.
872,00:34:56.10,00:34:56.10,"-Gather your stuff and head back to camp, guys. -JENNA: Thanks."
873,00:35:11.20,00:35:11.20,"Right now, my stomach is in a knot."
874,00:35:15.40,00:35:15.40,"I need about a bottle of Maalox,"
875,00:35:19.47,00:35:19.47,"a fifth of vodka, I need a pack of cigarettes--"
876,00:35:23.33,00:35:23.33," make that a carton  of cigarettes,"
877,00:35:24.93,00:35:24.93, because I don't know what I'm going to do right now.
878,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,"Christy, I don't want to, I don't want to grill you,"
879,00:35:32.07,00:35:32.07,but you're still going to vote for Heidi tonight?
880,00:35:35.10,00:35:35.10,I guess so.
881,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,-I... -Guess so?
882,00:35:37.73,00:35:37.73,"You know, I don't know."
883,00:35:39.63,00:35:39.63,The question is: who can I go farther with?
884,00:35:42.43,00:35:42.43,What can get me to be the sole Survivor?
885,00:35:45.30,00:35:45.30,You know what I mean?
886,00:35:46.70,00:35:46.70,-Can you take a walk with me? -Sure.
887,00:35:52.43,00:35:52.43,"You know, and I'm not saying,"
888,00:35:53.93,00:35:53.93,"like, I'm not going to decide Heidi tonight,"
889,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,but it's still in the air.
890,00:35:58.20,00:35:58.20,I'm still juggling it in my head.
891,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,"And I think that when I have the pen in my hand and that paper,"
892,00:36:03.40,00:36:03.40,that is going to be the decision.
893,00:36:05.13,00:36:05.13,"I also want to see how Tribal Council goes, so I-I don't know."
894,00:36:07.90,00:36:07.90,"You know, and it's more of a pride thing."
895,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,"It's like, how far am I willing to go?"
896,00:36:11.13,00:36:11.13,You're going to vote-vote for me then and vote with the girls?
897,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,"See, I-I-I don't, I ca-- I don't know."
898,00:36:18.23,00:36:18.23,"And that's a very hard thing for me to do,"
899,00:36:20.47,00:36:20.47,"you know, because I'm like..."
900,00:36:21.97,00:36:21.97,"ROB: The threat of Christy  defecting terrifies me,"
901,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,which got me to really start thinking about
902,00:36:27.33,00:36:27.33,an alternative scenario.
903,00:36:28.87,00:36:28.87,"You and Jenna, Matt and I--"
904,00:36:31.10,00:36:31.10,would you just want to make this really easy on everybody
905,00:36:33.87,00:36:33.87,and vote out Christy tonight?
906,00:36:35.87,00:36:35.87,You're willing to do that?
907,00:36:37.20,00:36:37.20,"Well, she still is up in the air."
908,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"Better-Better vote her off than-- I mean, the thing is that"
909,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,I realize that you guys aren't going to believe me.
910,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,-I mean... -But I would have to trust you on this.
911,00:36:47.03,00:36:47.03,"You'd have to trust me on this, but I'm trusting you"
912,00:36:50.30,00:36:50.30,"because if you and Jenna and Christy vote for me,"
913,00:36:52.90,00:36:52.90,"I'm done, and my game's over."
914,00:36:55.47,00:36:55.47,This is a gamble.
915,00:36:57.20,00:36:57.20,"Let's do it, let's do it."
916,00:36:58.90,00:36:58.90,Okay?
917,00:37:00.20,00:37:00.20,ROB: This is really crazy stuff  to be going on.
918,00:37:02.53,00:37:02.53,I can't believe I'm back in Jenna and Heidi's good graces.
919,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13, I've made the promise to them  that I'm not going to
920,00:37:07.43,00:37:07.43, screw them on this.  They made a promise to me
921,00:37:09.23,00:37:09.23," they're not going to  screw me on this,"
922,00:37:10.87,00:37:10.87, and let's see what happens.
923,00:37:24.07,00:37:24.07,We'll now bring in the members of our jury--
924,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,"Dave, Deena, and Alex, our newest member,"
925,00:37:30.00,00:37:30.00,voted out at the last Tribal Council.
926,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,33 days.
927,00:37:37.40,00:37:37.40,Not bad.
928,00:37:39.07,00:37:39.07,Anybody here willing to fess up that they really weren't sure
929,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,when this thing started that they'd make it this far?
930,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87,Really?
931,00:37:47.47,00:37:47.47,"Jenna, why'd you have any doubts?"
932,00:37:49.40,00:37:49.40,Sometimes people just don't like you
933,00:37:51.67,00:37:51.67,and that's the only reason they have for voting you out.
934,00:37:53.70,00:37:53.70,I'm judged all the time by just outside looks.
935,00:37:57.77,00:37:57.77,"I mean, I don't think that women take to me very well."
936,00:38:01.47,00:38:01.47,"I mean, ""You're a stupid model, you can't hack it."""
937,00:38:03.57,00:38:03.57,"So I felt like I've had to work twice as hard to get here,"
938,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,and I think Heidi feels the same.
939,00:38:09.47,00:38:09.47,"Rob, have you had to work harder?"
940,00:38:10.90,00:38:10.90,"Well, I was lucky in this game that I'm not handsome,"
941,00:38:14.07,00:38:14.07,"so I didn't have any, uh, handicaps like the girls found."
942,00:38:19.13,00:38:19.13,PROBST: So it's at that point in the game
943,00:38:20.60,00:38:20.60,"where two different philosophies seem to begin to emerge,"
944,00:38:24.70,00:38:24.70,and one is playing to win
945,00:38:26.90,00:38:26.90,and one is playing to get as far as I can get.
946,00:38:30.07,00:38:30.07,"Are you noticing that start to emerge, Rob, within yourself?"
947,00:38:33.40,00:38:33.40,"No, Jeff."
948,00:38:34.67,00:38:34.67,Anything short of being
949,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,the sole Survivor in this game I will consider a letdown.
950,00:38:39.23,00:38:39.23,It's all or nothing for me in this game.
951,00:38:41.20,00:38:41.20,"How about for you, Jenna?"
952,00:38:42.67,00:38:42.67,"Um, I came to the game to win,"
953,00:38:44.87,00:38:44.87,but I will not do certain things to get that money.
954,00:38:48.40,00:38:48.40,"I will not stab friends in the back,"
955,00:38:50.10,00:38:50.10,unless they stab me in the back first.
956,00:38:51.73,00:38:51.73,I won't do it.
957,00:38:53.10,00:38:53.10,"And that's where I draw the line,"
958,00:38:54.93,00:38:54.93,and that's where some people don't draw the line.
959,00:38:56.73,00:38:56.73,"Christy, is there a line you won't cross to win?"
960,00:38:59.20,00:38:59.20,I don't know. I made it this far.
961,00:39:01.03,00:39:01.03,"It's like, gosh, I have the potential"
962,00:39:02.67,00:39:02.67,to make a million dollars.
963,00:39:03.97,00:39:03.97,I'm going to try to go all the way.
964,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,"And I think-- honestly, right now I think"
965,00:39:08.93,00:39:08.93,I am in the driver's seat.
966,00:39:10.53,00:39:10.53,I make the final decision.
967,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37,Really?
968,00:39:13.70,00:39:13.70,-For tonight's vote? -For tonight's vote.
969,00:39:17.07,00:39:17.07,"Jenna, well-earned immunity today."
970,00:39:19.80,00:39:19.80,-(chuckles) -You are safe.
971,00:39:21.77,00:39:21.77,You can always give that necklace up if you want.
972,00:39:25.17,00:39:25.17,I-I'd like to give it to Heidi.
973,00:39:28.40,00:39:28.40,Strategy-- that's all I can say.
974,00:39:30.50,00:39:30.50,PROBST: This is a first.
975,00:39:31.83,00:39:31.83,Give it over.
976,00:39:33.43,00:39:33.43,(Jenna murmurs)
977,00:39:34.70,00:39:34.70,Jenna giving up her immunity to Heidi.
978,00:39:38.67,00:39:38.67,Heidi is now the only person you cannot vote for.
979,00:39:41.20,00:39:41.20,Everybody else's head is on the block.
980,00:39:42.90,00:39:42.90,It is time to vote.
981,00:39:44.07,00:39:44.07,"Heidi, you're up."
982,00:40:00.53,00:40:00.53,Your wish has come true.
983,00:40:01.87,00:40:01.87,"You're going home, you're getting a shower,"
984,00:40:03.27,00:40:03.27,you're eating good food.
985,00:40:04.27,00:40:04.27,"Go look beautiful, be happy."
986,00:40:06.53,00:40:06.53,We don't need you.
987,00:40:18.47,00:40:18.47,I think you're a great girl.
988,00:40:19.77,00:40:19.77,"This is nothing against you personally,"
989,00:40:21.10,00:40:21.10,but the alliance is very strong.
990,00:40:22.83,00:40:22.83,I'm staying with the alliance all the way.
991,00:40:31.30,00:40:31.30,I'll go tally the votes.
992,00:40:43.83,00:40:43.83,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
993,00:40:46.20,00:40:46.20,Person voted out will be asked
994,00:40:47.43,00:40:47.43,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
995,00:40:49.10,00:40:49.10,I'll read the votes.
996,00:40:51.73,00:40:51.73,First vote...
997,00:40:54.70,00:40:54.70,Jenna.
998,00:41:00.40,00:41:00.40,Jenna.
999,00:41:01.50,00:41:01.50,That's two votes-- Jenna.
1000,00:41:04.27,00:41:04.27,Christy.
1001,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,Christy.
1002,00:41:11.10,00:41:11.10,"That's two votes-- Jenna, two votes-- Christy."
1003,00:41:17.33,00:41:17.33,Christy.
1004,00:41:19.60,00:41:19.60,"Three votes-- Christy, two votes-- Jenna."
1005,00:41:24.10,00:41:24.10,"11th person voted out of the tribe, and the fourth member"
1006,00:41:27.27,00:41:27.27,of our jury: Christy.
1007,00:41:38.80,00:41:38.80,"Christy, the tribe has spoken."
1008,00:41:55.47,00:41:55.47,"Well, obviously, Christy came into tonight's Tribal Council"
1009,00:41:58.93,00:41:58.93,feeling she was in a position of power.
1010,00:42:01.07,00:42:01.07,You guys let her feel that.
1011,00:42:03.37,00:42:03.37,"Based on the vote, it's obvious that she wasn't."
1012,00:42:06.23,00:42:06.23,Very similar to what happened to Alex
1013,00:42:08.73,00:42:08.73,at the last Tribal Council. So you now have
1014,00:42:10.93,00:42:10.93,at least two members on your jury
1015,00:42:13.70,00:42:13.70,who must feel a little betrayed.
1016,00:42:16.33,00:42:16.33,"I will only say this: It's one thing to get to the final two,"
1017,00:42:19.30,00:42:19.30,it is another thing to get
1018,00:42:20.87,00:42:20.87,the votes needed to win a million dollars.
1019,00:42:23.50,00:42:23.50,"You guys can get your torches, head back to camp."
1020,00:42:26.27,00:42:26.27,Good night.
1021,00:42:40.10,00:42:40.10,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
1022,00:42:46.47,00:42:46.47,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
1023,00:42:48.33,00:42:48.33, Sacrificing a friendship  offers Heidi an opportunity.
1024,00:42:51.67,00:42:51.67,"HEIDI:  She is genuinely,"
1025,00:42:52.93,00:42:52.93,genuinely concerned about her health.
1026,00:42:55.20,00:42:55.20, Definitely having Jenna
1027,00:42:56.43,00:42:56.43, voted out before me  works to my advantage.
1028,00:42:58.80,00:42:58.80,I want to campaign for her to go off.
1029,00:43:02.27,00:43:02.27,PROBST: And carelessness  has its consequences.
1030,00:43:11.53,00:43:11.53,I'm so pissed off.
1031,00:43:12.93,00:43:12.93,I didn't deserve to be voted out.
1032,00:43:14.93,00:43:14.93,I didn't.
1033,00:43:16.30,00:43:16.30," I developed trust,"
1034,00:43:17.83,00:43:17.83, and I knew from day one  don't trust anybody.
1035,00:43:21.50,00:43:21.50, I can leave here  knowing that I'm a role model
1036,00:43:23.90,00:43:23.90, and that I can  make a difference.
1037,00:43:25.37,00:43:25.37, I'm going to make sure  those freakin' evil
1038,00:43:27.43,00:43:27.43,stepsisters of mine
1039,00:43:29.20,00:43:29.20,are not going to win the million dollars.
