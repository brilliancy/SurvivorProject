1,00:00:01.33,00:00:01.33,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.33,00:00:03.33,"With Alex, Jenna, Heidi and Rob"
3,00:00:05.73,00:00:05.73," secure in their alliance, Butch, Matt and Christy"
4,00:00:08.03,00:00:08.03, were left doing all the work.
5,00:00:09.73,00:00:09.73,"CHRISTY: Sometimes it's like, come on,"
6,00:00:11.43,00:00:11.43, get off your butt and go and try to do something.
7,00:00:14.03,00:00:14.03,And they just do jack ...
8,00:00:15.87,00:00:15.87,"PROBST: At the auction,letters from home caused a stir"
9,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57, and delivered good news to a relieved Jenna.
10,00:00:22.37,00:00:22.37,HEIDI: Jenna's mom is sick; she has cancer.
11,00:00:24.30,00:00:24.30, And she started crying because her mom
12,00:00:26.00,00:00:26.00, had written that the brain tumor
13,00:00:29.33,00:00:29.33,had decreased by 50%.
14,00:00:31.50,00:00:31.50,PROBST: When Alex boldly told Rob
15,00:00:33.27,00:00:33.27, of his plans for the final four...
16,00:00:35.30,00:00:35.30,"If I win immunity,my vote goes for you."
17,00:00:37.73,00:00:37.73,Are you cool with that?
18,00:00:39.10,00:00:39.10, ...Rob set a plan in motion to save his skin.
19,00:00:42.13,00:00:42.13,"Me, you, Butch and Christyvote out Alex tomorrow."
20,00:00:44.23,00:00:44.23,That's what I was thinking.
21,00:00:45.73,00:00:45.73," And with his victory at the immunity challenge,"
22,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00, Rob was firmly in control.
23,00:00:50.33,00:00:50.33,These are my people.
24,00:00:51.77,00:00:51.77," At Tribal Council, Jenna and Heidi were stunned to find"
25,00:00:55.53,00:00:55.53, Rob had turned on their alliance.
26,00:00:57.43,00:00:57.43,Alex was the ninth person voted out of the Amazon and became
27,00:01:01.47,00:01:01.47, the third member of the jury.
28,00:01:03.63,00:01:03.63, Six are left.
29,00:01:05.17,00:01:05.17, Who will be voted out tonight?
30,00:02:07.30,00:02:07.30,(thunder crashing)
31,00:02:15.03,00:02:15.03,"Stick with the, um, dry stuff."
32,00:02:17.83,00:02:17.83,"Actually, it may startjust running on coals."
33,00:02:19.87,00:02:19.87,Yeah.
34,00:02:21.07,00:02:21.07,-How's it looking?-It's starting.
35,00:02:22.87,00:02:22.87,Slowly but surely.
36,00:02:24.37,00:02:24.37,"-Mm-mm.-JENNA: At Tribal Council,"
37,00:02:25.83,00:02:25.83," when I heard the vote, I almost passed out."
38,00:02:27.83,00:02:27.83, I felt betrayed more than I've ever felt in my life.
39,00:02:31.47,00:02:31.47,Rob screwed the alliance.
40,00:02:32.77,00:02:32.77,"He betrayed me and Heidi,he betrayed Alex."
41,00:02:35.33,00:02:35.33,I couldn't imaginehow Alex felt.
42,00:02:36.73,00:02:36.73, I didn't think that people would sacrifice
43,00:02:38.60,00:02:38.60, personal relationships for a gamble.
44,00:02:40.90,00:02:40.90, We hate him.
45,00:02:42.10,00:02:42.10, Me and Heidi cannot ever forgive him.
46,00:02:44.10,00:02:44.10,"Yeah, I-I just want...I want to say something."
47,00:02:46.90,00:02:46.90,I voted probablydifferently than-than
48,00:02:49.17,00:02:49.17,some people expected meto vote tonight.
49,00:02:51.73,00:02:51.73,And it wasn't because
50,00:02:53.30,00:02:53.30,"I don't like Alex,but I just felt as though"
51,00:02:56.90,00:02:56.90,there were a lot of things
52,00:02:58.13,00:02:58.13,that he was telling methat weren't true.
53,00:02:59.53,00:02:59.53,And if anybody wantsto speak with me about
54,00:03:02.23,00:03:02.23,"w-what I did, then,uh, I have n-no problem."
55,00:03:06.50,00:03:06.50,I also thoroughly enjoyed Alex'scompany throughout the game.
56,00:03:10.20,00:03:10.20,I have experienced
57,00:03:13.40,00:03:13.40,many instanceswhen he has been deceptive.
58,00:03:15.90,00:03:15.90,"HEIDI: Everybody took their turn talking,"
59,00:03:18.53,00:03:18.53,"except Jenna and I, because if Iwould have talked at that point,"
60,00:03:21.60,00:03:21.60, I would have had every single cuss word
61,00:03:23.80,00:03:23.80, come out of my mouth at that time.
62,00:03:26.10,00:03:26.10,MATTHEW:I'd also like to add
63,00:03:27.73,00:03:27.73,that I don't harbor any ill willtowards either of you ladies.
64,00:03:32.47,00:03:32.47,"Uh, it's a game."
65,00:03:33.47,00:03:33.47,You both voted against me.
66,00:03:35.37,00:03:35.37,"I can't saythat I'm gonna forget it,"
67,00:03:36.90,00:03:36.90,"but it's not going to affect,uh, the way"
68,00:03:39.43,00:03:39.43,we interact here at camp.
69,00:03:41.47,00:03:41.47,-Okay?-Good.
70,00:03:42.57,00:03:42.57,Good.
71,00:03:52.60,00:03:52.60,"HEIDI: It's just that,everything I've done in"
72,00:03:54.67,00:03:54.67,this game-- there's three guyshere that I have helped out.
73,00:03:57.67,00:03:57.67,They... Butch wouldn't evenbe here right now...
74,00:04:00.40,00:04:00.40,I know. I...
75,00:04:01.93,00:04:01.93,(sobbing)
76,00:04:02.93,00:04:02.93,HEIDI: I've never felt
77,00:04:04.07,00:04:04.07," so manipulated, cheated"
78,00:04:07.20,00:04:07.20,and hurt all at the same timein my entire life.
79,00:04:09.70,00:04:09.70,ROB:I'm sorry that I hurt you guys.
80,00:04:13.57,00:04:13.57,But it's time to evaluatewhat you're willing
81,00:04:17.10,00:04:17.10,to do to win this game.
82,00:04:18.63,00:04:18.63,I'm not willing to turn my backon people that I love.
83,00:04:21.67,00:04:21.67,I'm not willing to do that.(sniffles)
84,00:04:23.80,00:04:23.80,ROB: Jenna and Heidi were under the impression
85,00:04:27.37,00:04:27.37, that they were in the majority
86,00:04:28.93,00:04:28.93,and that they were gonna ridethis majority until the end.
87,00:04:31.70,00:04:31.70," But now the tables are completely turned,"
88,00:04:34.20,00:04:34.20, and it's Jenna and Heidi
89,00:04:36.33,00:04:36.33,who are gonna have to kisssome serious ass
90,00:04:38.80,00:04:38.80,in the next couple days toensure that one of them makes it
91,00:04:42.83,00:04:42.83, at least three more.
92,00:04:44.03,00:04:44.03,(sniffles)
93,00:04:45.30,00:04:45.30,(thunder rumbles)
94,00:05:08.90,00:05:08.90,MATTHEW: What happened yesterday was
95,00:05:11.57,00:05:11.57, it rained for about two hours.
96,00:05:14.10,00:05:14.10, It rained hard.
97,00:05:15.33,00:05:15.33, Our shelter is not waterproof.
98,00:05:18.23,00:05:18.23, The water was leaking through the roof.
99,00:05:21.50,00:05:21.50," Uh, the roof wasn't built correctly"
100,00:05:23.60,00:05:23.60," from the beginning, and everyone"
101,00:05:25.83,00:05:25.83,was miserable.
102,00:05:27.53,00:05:27.53,And then what we'll do is we'regonna bring it down like this
103,00:05:30.07,00:05:30.07,so it's on a nice slantand do the same thing there.
104,00:05:32.83,00:05:32.83,"Boom, boom, boom."
105,00:05:34.40,00:05:34.40,My suggestion was that we build another fire shelter
106,00:05:37.20,00:05:37.20," right adjacent to this one,"
107,00:05:40.03,00:05:40.03,"but use it for peopleand our belongings,"
108,00:05:43.30,00:05:43.30,as opposed to fire.
109,00:05:44.63,00:05:44.63, It's a real-- it's very easy to do.
110,00:05:46.03,00:05:46.03, We just have to string a couple poles across
111,00:05:48.90,00:05:48.90, and merely stack a lot of the palm fronds.
112,00:05:51.83,00:05:51.83,(thunder crashes)
113,00:05:53.23,00:05:53.23,"That's rain coming in, guys."
114,00:05:54.67,00:05:54.67,"-Okay. Palm fronds, buckets up.-Get ready."
115,00:05:56.87,00:05:56.87,Let's layer them right now.
116,00:05:58.57,00:05:58.57," So it's a quick fix, it does work,"
117,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93, and that's the project
118,00:06:01.97,00:06:01.97,for this morning.
119,00:06:17.53,00:06:17.53,Try and work your way across.
120,00:06:19.07,00:06:19.07,ROB:My right and your right.
121,00:06:20.27,00:06:20.27,-Your right.-Okay.
122,00:06:22.13,00:06:22.13,Piss off.
123,00:06:23.70,00:06:23.70,JENNA: There's no way we're throwing in the towel.
124,00:06:25.17,00:06:25.17, We've done all we can do.
125,00:06:27.03,00:06:27.03,"Someone stabbed us in the back,and eventually they'll pay."
126,00:06:29.93,00:06:29.93,"You never knowwho to trust out here, right?"
127,00:06:32.20,00:06:32.20,HEIDI:No.
128,00:06:33.70,00:06:33.70,"I've never lied to you, ever."
129,00:06:36.53,00:06:36.53,"I-I would never--I'd never lie to you, as well."
130,00:06:40.17,00:06:40.17,"-Hmm. -But then again,that's part of the game, right?"
131,00:06:42.57,00:06:42.57,"What do you do, you know?"
132,00:06:44.10,00:06:44.10,-Nothing.-Nothing.
133,00:06:45.37,00:06:45.37,"When we're gone,they said you're next."
134,00:06:47.57,00:06:47.57,Probably.
135,00:06:48.67,00:06:48.67,-And that sucks.-Yeah.
136,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,"HEIDI: I woke up this morning and I said, you know what,"
137,00:06:52.63,00:06:52.63,I didn't get out here 31 days
138,00:06:55.17,00:06:55.17,to be screwed overand just take it.
139,00:06:57.93,00:06:57.93,Doesn't it make you madthat we've come this far
140,00:07:00.50,00:07:00.50,and then those three guys aregetting ready to vote you off?
141,00:07:02.67,00:07:02.67,"-So, why-why can't you...-So, it's like, how do you,"
142,00:07:04.53,00:07:04.53,how do you change it?I don't know.
143,00:07:06.00,00:07:06.00,"HEIDI: I'm just saying,we've got a chance to either"
144,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,"go one, two, threeor we've got a chance"
145,00:07:09.87,00:07:09.87,to make it to the top three.
146,00:07:11.30,00:07:11.30,"-I mean, you know?-So, what do you want?"
147,00:07:12.67,00:07:12.67,"HEIDI: I know that Christy's the wild card,"
148,00:07:14.20,00:07:14.20," so my thing is, is that, okay,"
149,00:07:16.27,00:07:16.27, Christy makes it to the top four.
150,00:07:18.33,00:07:18.33, But if I can get Christy to go in with Jenna and myself
151,00:07:22.87,00:07:22.87, and try to vote one of the boys off--
152,00:07:25.37,00:07:25.37, 'cause they're gonna vote either me or Jenna off--
153,00:07:27.50,00:07:27.50,"then we stand a 50% chanceof staying,"
154,00:07:29.73,00:07:29.73,instead of a zero percent chanceof staying.
155,00:07:31.77,00:07:31.77,"So, Christy,you have to think about that."
156,00:07:33.63,00:07:33.63,It's your call.
157,00:07:34.93,00:07:34.93,-I don't know.I will think about it. -Okay.
158,00:07:36.80,00:07:36.80,"HEIDI: You could come inone, two or three."
159,00:07:38.60,00:07:38.60,"I mean, that's another gamble."
160,00:07:40.23,00:07:40.23,-You see what I'm saying?-Right.
161,00:07:41.23,00:07:41.23,And you just...
162,00:07:42.23,00:07:42.23,See what happens.
163,00:07:43.33,00:07:43.33,(thunder rumbles)
164,00:07:49.10,00:07:49.10,Watch out for big spiders.
165,00:07:50.80,00:07:50.80,Whoa!
166,00:07:54.50,00:07:54.50,I had a long talk withJenna and Heidi last night.
167,00:07:57.50,00:07:57.50,"And basically,their whole argument is that"
168,00:08:00.77,00:08:00.77,they can't believe that you are
169,00:08:04.33,00:08:04.33,gonna last longerin this game than them.
170,00:08:06.90,00:08:06.90,Yes!
171,00:08:08.03,00:08:08.03,I want to.I-I really want to.
172,00:08:09.97,00:08:09.97,-I feel like I deserve to.-Mm-hmm.
173,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,"Like, seriously,I really want to."
174,00:08:14.17,00:08:14.17,And that's my next challenge.
175,00:08:15.73,00:08:15.73,"Jenna said this,as I was talking to them,"
176,00:08:17.73,00:08:17.73,and she said thatthey've wor... they've worked
177,00:08:20.67,00:08:20.67,so much harder than you.
178,00:08:22.13,00:08:22.13,I don't think I've ever seenJenna chop down a tree.
179,00:08:24.67,00:08:24.67,CHRISTY: I think I could go farther with the girls
180,00:08:27.53,00:08:27.53, than with the guys.
181,00:08:29.40,00:08:29.40," But I like the guysbecause they're totally honest,"
182,00:08:32.60,00:08:32.60," they're totally cool, I have more fun with them."
183,00:08:35.67,00:08:35.67,"And I've been with these girlssince day one,"
184,00:08:38.23,00:08:38.23,and I really just...
185,00:08:40.40,00:08:40.40,(groans)
186,00:08:41.70,00:08:41.70,"And I-- what I thought was funnywas Heidi's like,"
187,00:08:43.57,00:08:43.57,"""We need to talk."""
188,00:08:45.00,00:08:45.00,"And I'm like, ""So, now you needto talk to me,"" you know?"
189,00:08:48.37,00:08:48.37,"-Yeah.-I mean, if they could"
190,00:08:50.00,00:08:50.00,"at least give me some respect,"
191,00:08:51.73,00:08:51.73,"consideration throughoutthe whole game,"
192,00:08:53.33,00:08:53.33,maybe it would havebeen different.
193,00:08:54.73,00:08:54.73,"So I personally have to decide,"
194,00:08:57.23,00:08:57.23,is it better to wina million dollars
195,00:08:59.13,00:08:59.13,or is it better to bethe final girl that kicked butt?
196,00:09:03.07,00:09:03.07,It's such a hard decision.
197,00:09:04.60,00:09:04.60,(chuckles)
198,00:09:05.60,00:09:05.60," Any way, I'm with the power."
199,00:09:07.13,00:09:07.13," It's like, how do you decide?"
200,00:09:08.40,00:09:08.40,All over it.
201,00:09:09.40,00:09:09.40,(spitting)
202,00:09:12.90,00:09:12.90,-Cool.-Cool.
203,00:09:18.33,00:09:18.33,"Come on in, guys!"
204,00:09:21.73,00:09:21.73,All right.

618,00:25:21.83,00:25:21.83,This is reallywhere I draw the line.
619,00:25:24.00,00:25:24.00,"-It's fine, it's fine.-No, it's not fine."

622,00:25:30.77,00:25:30.77,This isn't right anymore.

634,00:25:56.10,00:25:56.10,"Well, then that wouldn'tsurprise me."
635,00:25:57.90,00:25:57.90,Then why wouldn't everybody elsethink that you've lied to them?
636,00:26:00.80,00:26:00.80,ROB: I told every personin this game...

688,00:28:05.60,00:28:05.60,and how much they trust me.

809,00:32:30.43,00:32:30.43,"Strategy, or just a weak toss?"
810,00:32:33.17,00:32:33.17,Jenna with a big stack of pucks.
811,00:32:37.63,00:32:37.63,Knocks Christy out of the way.
812,00:32:39.10,00:32:39.10,"Heidi with four,using one of her first pucks."
813,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,Hmm.
814,00:32:44.40,00:32:44.40,Matthew has but one puck.
815,00:32:45.73,00:32:45.73,"You get one shot at this ""X."""
816,00:32:49.77,00:32:49.77,"Oh, my."
817,00:32:51.40,00:32:51.40,"Matthew moves his puck closestto the ""X"" for the time being."
818,00:32:54.57,00:32:54.57,"-Only one, guys.-Next round, Butch."
819,00:32:57.63,00:32:57.63,"Good job, Butch."
820,00:32:58.87,00:32:58.87,"Butch knocks Matthew out,"
821,00:33:00.90,00:33:00.90,-puts himself closer.-Out.
822,00:33:02.40,00:33:02.40,Matthew's out of the game.
823,00:33:03.77,00:33:03.77,"Rob, this is your last puck."
824,00:33:07.77,00:33:07.77,Oh.
825,00:33:09.37,00:33:09.37,"I think Rob just slidinto first place with that,"
826,00:33:11.67,00:33:11.67,"knocking Butch out,but Rob is out of pucks."
827,00:33:13.97,00:33:13.97,Christy.
828,00:33:16.63,00:33:16.63,Christy's still gettinga feel of the board.
829,00:33:18.37,00:33:18.37,Jenna.
830,00:33:20.03,00:33:20.03,Jenna slides into the lead.

833,00:33:29.83,00:33:29.83,We go to Christy.
834,00:33:35.03,00:33:35.03,-Ooh.-Jenna protects her lead
835,00:33:36.07,00:33:36.07,by knocking Butchout of the way.
836,00:33:37.93,00:33:37.93,"Right now,Jenna closest to the ""X."""
837,00:33:42.40,00:33:42.40,"And Heidi just knocked Robinto immunity,"
838,00:33:45.87,00:33:45.87,knocking Jenna out of immunity.
839,00:33:47.23,00:33:47.23,"Rob now closest,and he's protected by Heidi."
840,00:33:49.60,00:33:49.60,"What are you going to do, Butch?"
841,00:33:51.47,00:33:51.47,"Let's see if I can hit Jenna's,bounce back, stay right there."
842,00:33:53.60,00:33:53.60,How's that sound?
843,00:33:54.93,00:33:54.93,(chuckles)
844,00:33:59.10,00:33:59.10,Just like you planned!
845,00:34:01.07,00:34:01.07,Butch looking at immunity.
846,00:34:02.97,00:34:02.97,"Christy, your last puck,make it a good one."
847,00:34:06.73,00:34:06.73,Oh!
848,00:34:08.07,00:34:08.07,Christy knocks everybody out.
849,00:34:10.13,00:34:10.13,Rob is now sittingclosest to immunity.
850,00:34:12.53,00:34:12.53,Jenna.
851,00:34:13.87,00:34:13.87,Damn it.
852,00:34:15.63,00:34:15.63,"PROBST:Heidi, this is your last puck."
853,00:34:17.87,00:34:17.87,HEIDI:Oh.
854,00:34:19.03,00:34:19.03,PROBST:It's between Butch and Jenna.
855,00:34:20.47,00:34:20.47,"Butch, this is your last puck."
856,00:34:22.10,00:34:22.10,Rob is currentlylooking at immunity.
857,00:34:26.43,00:34:26.43,(Butch groans)
858,00:34:27.70,00:34:27.70,"Heidi is closest tothe center of the ""X"" right now."
859,00:34:29.70,00:34:29.70,"Jenna, here's the deal."
860,00:34:31.30,00:34:31.30,Heidi's currentlysitting on immunity.
861,00:34:32.97,00:34:32.97,You have one puck left.
862,00:34:34.43,00:34:34.43,What you have to think about ishow you're going to use it--
863,00:34:37.00,00:34:37.00,offensively or defensively.
864,00:34:39.07,00:34:39.07,I have my own plans.
865,00:34:40.77,00:34:40.77,Secret.
866,00:34:45.30,00:34:45.30,"Well, it worked."
867,00:34:47.13,00:34:47.13,"Jenna knocks Heidi and Robout of the game, wins immunity."
868,00:34:49.37,00:34:49.37,Nice job. You are safefrom the vote tonight.
869,00:34:52.13,00:34:52.13,You cannot be voted out.
870,00:34:53.73,00:34:53.73,Everybody else is fair game.
871,00:34:56.10,00:34:56.10,"-Gather your stuff and head backto camp, guys. -JENNA: Thanks."
872,00:35:11.20,00:35:11.20,"Right now,my stomach is in a knot."
873,00:35:15.40,00:35:15.40,"I need about a bottle of Maalox,"
874,00:35:19.47,00:35:19.47,"a fifth of vodka,I need a pack of cigarettes--"
875,00:35:23.33,00:35:23.33," make that a carton of cigarettes,"
876,00:35:24.93,00:35:24.93, because I don't knowwhat I'm going to do right now.
877,00:35:29.73,00:35:29.73,"Christy, I don't want to,I don't want to grill you,"
878,00:35:32.07,00:35:32.07,but you're still going to votefor Heidi tonight?
879,00:35:35.10,00:35:35.10,I guess so.
880,00:35:36.73,00:35:36.73,-I...-Guess so?
881,00:35:37.73,00:35:37.73,"You know, I don't know."
882,00:35:39.63,00:35:39.63,The question is:who can I go farther with?
883,00:35:42.43,00:35:42.43,What can get me to bethe sole Survivor?
884,00:35:45.30,00:35:45.30,You know what I mean?
885,00:35:46.70,00:35:46.70,-Can you take a walk with me?-Sure.
886,00:35:52.43,00:35:52.43,"You know, and I'm not saying,"
887,00:35:53.93,00:35:53.93,"like, I'm not going todecide Heidi tonight,"
888,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,but it's still in the air.
889,00:35:58.20,00:35:58.20,I'm still juggling itin my head.
890,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,"And I think that when I have thepen in my hand and that paper,"
891,00:36:03.40,00:36:03.40,that is going to bethe decision.
892,00:36:05.13,00:36:05.13,"I also want to see how TribalCouncil goes, so I-I don't know."
893,00:36:07.90,00:36:07.90,"You know, and it's moreof a pride thing."
894,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,"It's like, how faram I willing to go?"
895,00:36:11.13,00:36:11.13,You're going to vote-vote for methen and vote with the girls?
896,00:36:15.30,00:36:15.30,"See, I-I-I don't, I ca--I don't know."
897,00:36:18.23,00:36:18.23,"And that's a very hard thingfor me to do,"
898,00:36:20.47,00:36:20.47,"you know, because I'm like..."
899,00:36:21.97,00:36:21.97,"ROB: The threat of Christy defecting terrifies me,"
900,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17,which got me to reallystart thinking about
901,00:36:27.33,00:36:27.33,an alternative scenario.
902,00:36:28.87,00:36:28.87,"You and Jenna, Matt and I--"
903,00:36:31.10,00:36:31.10,would you just want to make thisreally easy on everybody
904,00:36:33.87,00:36:33.87,and vote out Christy tonight?
905,00:36:35.87,00:36:35.87,You're willing to do that?
906,00:36:37.20,00:36:37.20,"Well, she still isup in the air."
907,00:36:39.20,00:36:39.20,"Better-Better vote her offthan-- I mean, the thing is that"
908,00:36:42.50,00:36:42.50,I realize that you guys aren'tgoing to believe me.
909,00:36:44.77,00:36:44.77,-I mean... -But I would have totrust you on this.
910,00:36:47.03,00:36:47.03,"You'd have to trust me on this,but I'm trusting you"
911,00:36:50.30,00:36:50.30,"because if you and Jennaand Christy vote for me,"
912,00:36:52.90,00:36:52.90,"I'm done, and my game's over."
913,00:36:55.47,00:36:55.47,This is a gamble.
914,00:36:57.20,00:36:57.20,"Let's do it, let's do it."
915,00:36:58.90,00:36:58.90,Okay?
916,00:37:00.20,00:37:00.20,ROB: This is really crazy stuff to be going on.
917,00:37:02.53,00:37:02.53,I can't believe I'm back inJenna and Heidi's good graces.
918,00:37:05.13,00:37:05.13, I've made the promise to them that I'm not going to
919,00:37:07.43,00:37:07.43, screw them on this. They made a promise to me
920,00:37:09.23,00:37:09.23," they're not going to screw me on this,"
921,00:37:10.87,00:37:10.87, and let's see what happens.
922,00:37:24.07,00:37:24.07,We'll now bring inthe members of our jury--
923,00:37:26.17,00:37:26.17,"Dave, Deena, and Alex,our newest member,"
924,00:37:30.00,00:37:30.00,voted outat the last Tribal Council.
925,00:37:35.17,00:37:35.17,33 days.
926,00:37:37.40,00:37:37.40,Not bad.
927,00:37:39.07,00:37:39.07,Anybody here willing to fess upthat they really weren't sure
928,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,when this thing startedthat they'd make it this far?
929,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87,Really?
930,00:37:47.47,00:37:47.47,"Jenna, why'd you haveany doubts?"
931,00:37:49.40,00:37:49.40,Sometimes peoplejust don't like you
932,00:37:51.67,00:37:51.67,and that's the only reasonthey have for voting you out.
933,00:37:53.70,00:37:53.70,I'm judged all the timeby just outside looks.
934,00:37:57.77,00:37:57.77,"I mean, I don't think that womentake to me very well."
935,00:38:01.47,00:38:01.47,"I mean, ""You're a stupid model,you can't hack it."""
936,00:38:03.57,00:38:03.57,"So I felt like I've had to worktwice as hard to get here,"
937,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,and I thinkHeidi feels the same.
938,00:38:09.47,00:38:09.47,"Rob, have youhad to work harder?"
939,00:38:10.90,00:38:10.90,"Well, I was lucky in this gamethat I'm not handsome,"
940,00:38:14.07,00:38:14.07,"so I didn't have any, uh,handicaps like the girls found."
941,00:38:19.13,00:38:19.13,PROBST: So it's at that pointin the game
942,00:38:20.60,00:38:20.60,"where two different philosophiesseem to begin to emerge,"
943,00:38:24.70,00:38:24.70,and one is playing to win
944,00:38:26.90,00:38:26.90,and one is playing to getas far as I can get.
945,00:38:30.07,00:38:30.07,"Are you noticing that start toemerge, Rob, within yourself?"
946,00:38:33.40,00:38:33.40,"No, Jeff."
947,00:38:34.67,00:38:34.67,Anything short of being
948,00:38:36.47,00:38:36.47,the sole Survivor in this gameI will consider a letdown.
949,00:38:39.23,00:38:39.23,It's all or nothing for mein this game.
950,00:38:41.20,00:38:41.20,"How about for you, Jenna?"
951,00:38:42.67,00:38:42.67,"Um, I came to the game to win,"
952,00:38:44.87,00:38:44.87,but I will not do certain thingsto get that money.
953,00:38:48.40,00:38:48.40,"I will not stab friendsin the back,"
954,00:38:50.10,00:38:50.10,unless they stab mein the back first.
955,00:38:51.73,00:38:51.73,I won't do it.
956,00:38:53.10,00:38:53.10,"And that's whereI draw the line,"
957,00:38:54.93,00:38:54.93,and that's where some peopledon't draw the line.
958,00:38:56.73,00:38:56.73,"Christy, is there a lineyou won't cross to win?"
959,00:38:59.20,00:38:59.20,I don't know.I made it this far.
960,00:39:01.03,00:39:01.03,"It's like,gosh, I have the potential"
961,00:39:02.67,00:39:02.67,to make a million dollars.
962,00:39:03.97,00:39:03.97,I'm going to tryto go all the way.
963,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,"And I think--honestly, right now I think"
964,00:39:08.93,00:39:08.93,I am in the driver's seat.
965,00:39:10.53,00:39:10.53,I make the final decision.
966,00:39:12.37,00:39:12.37,Really?
967,00:39:13.70,00:39:13.70,-For tonight's vote?-For tonight's vote.
968,00:39:17.07,00:39:17.07,"Jenna, well-earnedimmunity today."
969,00:39:19.80,00:39:19.80,-(chuckles)-You are safe.
970,00:39:21.77,00:39:21.77,You can always givethat necklace up if you want.
971,00:39:25.17,00:39:25.17,I-I'd like to give it to Heidi.
972,00:39:28.40,00:39:28.40,Strategy-- that's all I can say.
973,00:39:30.50,00:39:30.50,PROBST:This is a first.
974,00:39:31.83,00:39:31.83,Give it over.
975,00:39:33.43,00:39:33.43,(Jenna murmurs)
976,00:39:34.70,00:39:34.70,Jenna giving upher immunity to Heidi.
977,00:39:38.67,00:39:38.67,Heidi is now the only personyou cannot vote for.
978,00:39:41.20,00:39:41.20,Everybody else's headis on the block.
979,00:39:42.90,00:39:42.90,It is time to vote.
980,00:39:44.07,00:39:44.07,"Heidi, you're up."
981,00:40:00.53,00:40:00.53,Your wish has come true.
982,00:40:01.87,00:40:01.87,"You're going home,you're getting a shower,"
983,00:40:03.27,00:40:03.27,you're eating good food.
984,00:40:04.27,00:40:04.27,"Go look beautiful, be happy."
985,00:40:06.53,00:40:06.53,We don't need you.
986,00:40:18.47,00:40:18.47,I think you're a great girl.
987,00:40:19.77,00:40:19.77,"This is nothingagainst you personally,"
988,00:40:21.10,00:40:21.10,but the alliance is very strong.
989,00:40:22.83,00:40:22.83,I'm staying withthe alliance all the way.
990,00:40:31.30,00:40:31.30,I'll go tally the votes.
991,00:40:43.83,00:40:43.83,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
992,00:40:46.20,00:40:46.20,Person voted out will be asked
993,00:40:47.43,00:40:47.43,to leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
994,00:40:49.10,00:40:49.10,I'll read the votes.
995,00:40:51.73,00:40:51.73,First vote...
996,00:40:54.70,00:40:54.70,Jenna.
997,00:41:00.40,00:41:00.40,Jenna.
998,00:41:01.50,00:41:01.50,That's two votes-- Jenna.
999,00:41:04.27,00:41:04.27,Christy.
1000,00:41:09.73,00:41:09.73,Christy.
1001,00:41:11.10,00:41:11.10,"That's two votes-- Jenna,two votes-- Christy."
1002,00:41:17.33,00:41:17.33,Christy.
1003,00:41:19.60,00:41:19.60,"Three votes-- Christy,two votes-- Jenna."
1004,00:41:24.10,00:41:24.10,"11th person voted out of thetribe, and the fourth member"
1005,00:41:27.27,00:41:27.27,of our jury: Christy.
1006,00:41:38.80,00:41:38.80,"Christy, the tribe has spoken."
1007,00:41:55.47,00:41:55.47,"Well, obviously, Christy cameinto tonight's Tribal Council"
1008,00:41:58.93,00:41:58.93,feeling she was ina position of power.
1009,00:42:01.07,00:42:01.07,You guys let her feel that.
1010,00:42:03.37,00:42:03.37,"Based on the vote,it's obvious that she wasn't."
1011,00:42:06.23,00:42:06.23,Very similarto what happened to Alex
1012,00:42:08.73,00:42:08.73,at the last Tribal Council.So you now have
1013,00:42:10.93,00:42:10.93,at least two memberson your jury
1014,00:42:13.70,00:42:13.70,who must feel a little betrayed.
1015,00:42:16.33,00:42:16.33,"I will only say this: It's onething to get to the final two,"
1016,00:42:19.30,00:42:19.30,it is another thing to get
1017,00:42:20.87,00:42:20.87,the votes needed to wina million dollars.
1018,00:42:23.50,00:42:23.50,"You guys can get your torches,head back to camp."
1019,00:42:26.27,00:42:26.27,Good night.
1020,00:42:40.10,00:42:40.10,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
1021,00:42:46.47,00:42:46.47,PROBST: Next time on Survivor...
1022,00:42:48.33,00:42:48.33, Sacrificing a friendship offers Heidi an opportunity.
1023,00:42:51.67,00:42:51.67,"HEIDI: She is genuinely,"
1024,00:42:52.93,00:42:52.93,genuinely concernedabout her health.
1025,00:42:55.20,00:42:55.20, Definitely having Jenna
1026,00:42:56.43,00:42:56.43, voted out before me works to my advantage.
1027,00:42:58.80,00:42:58.80,I want to campaign for herto go off.
1028,00:43:02.27,00:43:02.27,PROBST: And carelessness has its consequences.
1029,00:43:11.53,00:43:11.53,I'm so pissed off.
1030,00:43:12.93,00:43:12.93,I didn't deserveto be voted out.
1031,00:43:14.93,00:43:14.93,I didn't.
1032,00:43:16.30,00:43:16.30," I developed trust,"
1033,00:43:17.83,00:43:17.83, and I knew from day one don't trust anybody.
1034,00:43:21.50,00:43:21.50, I can leave here knowing that I'm a role model
1035,00:43:23.90,00:43:23.90, and that I can make a difference.
1036,00:43:25.37,00:43:25.37, I'm going to make sure those freakin' evil
1037,00:43:27.43,00:43:27.43,stepsisters of mine
1038,00:43:29.20,00:43:29.20,are not going to winthe million dollars.
