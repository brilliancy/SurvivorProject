726,00:47:33.57,00:47:33.57,"WITH PHILLIP, SO INSTEAD OF FRANCESCA, IT'S ALMOST BETTER TO"
727,00:47:37.20,00:47:37.20,GO THAT WAY. >> I HEARD STRATEGY TALK.
728,00:47:41.60,00:47:41.60,AND I'M LIKE I SHOULD TALK TO FRANCESCA SO SHE DOESN'T YOU
729,00:47:45.03,00:47:45.03,KNOW SO SHE THINKS A LOT OF US ARE ON BOARD WITH HER.
730,00:47:47.57,00:47:47.57,"AND I WAS LIKE SO, LIKE, WHAT'S UP?"
731,00:47:49.77,00:47:49.77,WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? AND SHE'S THINKING OF YOU.
732,00:47:53.03,00:47:53.03,"LIKE, SHE NEEDS TO GO. >> WHAT."
733,00:47:55.30,00:47:55.30,>> I THINK SHE NEEDS TO GO. >> I TOLD YOU.
734,00:47:58.10,00:47:58.10,SHE'S ALWAYS STRATEGIZING. SHE DOESN'T WAIT.
735,00:48:00.87,00:48:00.87,SHE'S NOT PATIENT. SHE NEEDS TO GO.
736,00:48:02.50,00:48:02.50,I LIKE THE IDEA OF VOTING FRANCESCA OUT FIRST AGAIN.
737,00:48:06.03,00:48:06.03,"YOU NEED TO BE LIKE MACHIAVELLI WHO SAID,, IF YOU COME AT ME"
738,00:48:11.00,00:48:11.00,"ONCE, I WILL BURN YOUR VILLAGE. I WILL KILL YOUR AUNTS, UNCLES"
739,00:48:14.87,00:48:14.87,AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SO NONE OF YOUR KIND WILL EXIST AGAIN
740,00:48:21.70,00:48:21.70,OPINION >> OH!
741,00:48:36.57,00:48:36.57,">> SO I GUESS PHILLIP, HUH? >> DEFINITELY."
742,00:48:40.90,00:48:40.90,"HE SAID, ""I'VE GOT A CHOICE FOR YOU."""
743,00:48:43.23,00:48:43.23,"HE SAID, ""YOU'RE EITHER WITH ME, OR YOU'RE NOT BUT IF YOU'RE NOT"
744,00:48:47.13,00:48:47.13,"WE STILL HAVE THE NUMBERS ANYWAY."""
745,00:48:49.30,00:48:49.30,SO ME BASICALLY DIDN'T EVEN GET ME A CHOICE.
746,00:48:51.70,00:48:51.70,"HE SAID, ""YOU'RE WITH ME OR YOU'RE DEAD,"" BASICALLY."
747,00:48:55.57,00:48:55.57,HE SCARES ME PHILLIP BASICALLY APPROACHED ME ON THE FIRST DAY
748,00:48:58.73,00:48:58.73,"AND HE SAID, ""YOU CAN BE WITH ME AND WE HAVE THE NUMBERS OR CAN"
749,00:49:02.90,00:49:02.90,"BE AGAINST ME, AND I HAVE THE NUMBERS ANYWAY."""
750,00:49:05.00,00:49:05.00,MAYBE HE DOES HAVE THE NUMBERS. MAYBE PHILLIP DOES HAVE ENOUGH
751,00:49:07.77,00:49:07.77,"PEOPLE THAT HE CAN CONTROL THE GAME, BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT"
752,00:49:10.80,00:49:10.80,PHILLIP'S UP TO. HE'S QUIET.
753,00:49:12.80,00:49:12.80,HE'S JUST HANGING OUT. HE'S NOT SCRAMBLING TOO MUCH.
754,00:49:15.63,00:49:15.63,SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP HIS SLEEVE.
755,00:49:19.17,00:49:19.17,>> I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN WITH ERIK JUST NOW.
756,00:49:22.43,00:49:22.43,">> OH, YEAH, OKAY. HE'S TOTALLY FINE, RIGHT?"
757,00:49:26.63,00:49:26.63,>> HE SAID THERE'S NO DOUBT IN HIS MIND HE WANTS PHILLIP GONE
758,00:49:30.57,00:49:30.57,"FIRST BUT HE SAID PHILLIP CAME TO HIM AND SAID HE HAD NUMBERS,"
759,00:49:34.80,00:49:34.80,"BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. >> REALLY?"
760,00:49:37.07,00:49:37.07,THEY HAVE NUMBERS. HOW ARE CORINNE AND PHILLIP
761,00:49:39.77,00:49:39.77,NUMBERS? WHO ELSE WILL BE PART OF THAT
762,00:49:41.50,00:49:41.50,ALLIANCE? >> I CAN ONLY GUESS MAYBE
763,00:49:43.43,00:49:43.43,ANDREA. >> NO.
764,00:49:43.87,00:49:43.87,>> I WOULD HOPE NOT BECAUSE WE ALREADY SPOKE WITH HER.
765,00:49:47.33,00:49:47.33,>> WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?
766,00:49:49.33,00:49:49.33,"I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, THERE ARE STILL CONVERSATIONS GOING ON BUT"
767,00:49:52.47,00:49:52.47,IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THAT PHILLIP IS GOING TO BE THE ONE
768,00:49:54.37,00:49:54.37,"TO GO. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, I COULD BE"
769,00:49:58.00,00:49:58.00,"BLINDSIDED. I COULD BE VOTED OUT FIRST,"
770,00:49:59.90,00:49:59.90,"TWICE, WHICH WOULD BE THE WORST THING EVER."
771,00:50:02.03,00:50:02.03,REALLY THE WORKFORCE THING EVER-- I REALLY CAN'T TALK ABOUT
772,00:50:04.43,00:50:04.43,"THAT POSSIBILITY RIGHT NOW. >> I DON'T KNOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY"
773,00:50:10.73,00:50:10.73,PREFERENCE OR INCLINATIONS OR SOMETHING?
774,00:50:12.37,00:50:12.37,>> WHAT ABOUT YOU? HOW ARE YOU THINKING YOU WANT TO
775,00:50:15.00,00:50:15.00,PLAY? BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY
776,00:50:16.40,00:50:16.40,WITH ME. I JUST FEEL I DO TRUST YOU.
777,00:50:19.23,00:50:19.23,I FEEL LIKE ONE GOOD PERSON TO TRUST IS GOING TO SAVE A LOT.
778,00:50:23.07,00:50:23.07,>> COMING INTO THIS GAME I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL OF HOW DAWN
779,00:50:26.37,00:50:26.37,WOULD REACT TO ME BECAUSE I ARGUABLY SCREWED HER OVER LAST
780,00:50:30.17,00:50:30.17,TIME. I VOTED HER OUT.
781,00:50:31.70,00:50:31.70,I WASN'T SURE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING TO BE ANY LINGERING
782,00:50:35.73,00:50:35.73,RESENTMENT. I LIKE FRANCESCA.
783,00:50:38.37,00:50:38.37,I WAS HOPING-- >>Y DON'T TRUST FRANNIE FOR THE

786,00:50:47.17,00:50:47.17,>> I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH HER. SHE'S HONEST TO A FAULT UNLESS
787,00:50:51.47,00:50:51.47,SHE'S REINVENTED HERSELF OVER THE PAST YEAR AND DECIDED TO
788,00:50:54.50,00:50:54.50,PLAY A MORE CUTTHROAT GAME. THE FACT THAT SHE IS WILLING TO
789,00:50:58.73,00:50:58.73,TAKE OUT FRANNIE WHO SHE PROFESSED TO WORK WITH INDICATES
790,00:51:03.67,00:51:03.67,THIS IS A NEW DAWN. MY CONVERSATION IS KIND OF WITH
791,00:51:07.33,00:51:07.33,"THE OTHER FACTION OF, LIKE, PHILLIP, ANDREA, YOU, ME,"
792,00:51:11.43,00:51:11.43,"MALCOLM. >> I THINK THE TRUTH IS, IN THIS"

796,00:51:21.47,00:51:21.47,TO WORK WITH YOU. I FEEL LIKE IT'S FAMILY FOR ME
797,00:51:25.60,00:51:25.60,TO TRUST. YOU KNOW I'M GOOD THIS IS A
798,00:51:28.20,00:51:28.20,GAME. COCHRAN AND I TALKED AT LENGTH
799,00:51:29.80,00:51:29.80,ABOUT STAYING TOGETHER AND VOTING TOGETHER AND I TRUST HIM
800,00:51:32.57,00:51:32.57,RIGHT NOW AND WHAT I'M GOG HAVE TO DO IS REALLY SEE WHAT'S IN
801,00:51:35.67,00:51:35.67,THE BEST INTEREST FOR US AS FAR AS WHERE TO VOTE BECAUSE
802,00:51:38.30,00:51:38.30,"WHEREVER COCHRAN AND I LIE WE KIND OF SWING, AS FAR AS I CAN"

806,00:51:48.60,00:51:48.60,">> WE HAVE TO COME TO A DECISION RELATIVELY QUICKLY, THOUGH."
807,00:51:51.30,00:51:51.30,>> I KNOW. WHEW.
808,00:51:54.13,00:51:54.13,"I WOULD LIKE USUL TO VOTE FOR PHILLIP, BUT JUST IN CASE, I"
809,00:51:57.97,00:51:57.97,DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO SPLIT THE VOTE BETWEEN HIM AND
810,00:52:01.63,00:52:01.63,CORINNE. >> YOU'RE SAYING CORINNE NEXT.
811,00:52:03.60,00:52:03.60,">> SHH. I'M THINKING, JUST BECAUSE I"
812,00:52:08.23,00:52:08.23,DON'T TRUST HER. MALCOLM IS NOT TALKING UNLESS
813,00:52:11.07,00:52:11.07,HE'S TALKING TO ANY OF YOU GUYS. >> THAT WOULD BE MALCOLM.
814,00:52:14.40,00:52:14.40,"CORINNE, PHILLIP. THAT'S ALL WE NEED."
815,00:52:16.53,00:52:16.53,">> BUT IF THEY HAVE AN IDOL, THEY ONLY NEED THREE."

817,00:52:22.60,00:52:22.60,>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE CONSIDERING IS SPLITTING THE
818,00:52:25.47,00:52:25.47,"VOTES BECAUSE AS UNLIKELY AS IT MAY SEEM, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT"
819,00:52:28.30,00:52:28.30,"PHILLIP HAS AN IDOL, AND I HATE TO, LIKE, GO DOWN THIS PARANOID"
820,00:52:32.73,00:52:32.73,"ROAD, BUT I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT"
821,00:52:35.27,00:52:35.27,ABOUT THE WAY THEY'RE BEHAVING. >> SO NOW WHAT?
822,00:52:42.23,00:52:42.23,>> ANDREA KNOWS WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE.
823,00:52:44.63,00:52:44.63,AND WHAT IF SHE TELLS . >> FRAN TRUSTS HER.
824,00:52:47.87,00:52:47.87,>> WHO? >> ANDREA.

829,00:52:57.47,00:52:57.47,>> AND SO IS ERIK. >> DAWN YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
830,00:53:02.07,00:53:02.07,I DON'T TRUST ANDREA AT ALL. SHE'LL BE TALKING TO ONE PERSON
831,00:53:05.07,00:53:05.07,"ONE SECOND, TALKING TO ANOTHER PERSON THE NEXT."
832,00:53:08.53,00:53:08.53,"STRATEGY, STRATEGY. SHE'S STRATEGIC, DUDE."
833,00:53:12.03,00:53:12.03,SHE'S AWARE. I'M MORE INTIMIDATED BY ANDREA
834,00:53:14.73,00:53:14.73,THAN ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE. I THINK FRAN HAS THE FENCE ON
835,00:53:20.30,00:53:20.30,ANDREA. I DON'T KNOW ANDREA WELL.
836,00:53:22.53,00:53:22.53,"IF SHE'S NERVOUS ABOUT IT, THEN DO IT."

845,00:53:54.77,00:53:54.77,ANDREA AND COCK RAIN THINK WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE BECAUSE THEY
846,00:53:57.40,00:53:57.40,COULD HAVE TOLD EVERYBODY THAT WE'RE SPLITTING THE VOTE.
847,00:53:59.43,00:53:59.43,>> I TRUST COCHRAN. >> YOU TRUST COCHRAN?
