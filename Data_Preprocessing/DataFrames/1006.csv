2,00:00:03.58,00:00:03.58,Survivor... >> Your shoulder's right
3,00:00:05.71,00:00:05.71,on my head. >> JEFF: A close relationship
4,00:00:08.50,00:00:08.50,developed at Koror. >> Jennifer and Gregg have
5,00:00:10.38,00:00:10.38,"definitely teamed off. I mean, they've got to"
6,00:00:13.33,00:00:13.33,to think we're stupid if we can't tell that
7,00:00:15.12,00:00:15.12,"they're together. >> Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
8,00:00:17.04,00:00:17.04,>> JEFF: Ulong got lost in a storm.
9,00:00:19.17,00:00:19.17,>> I'm going back to camp. >> Why are you going
10,00:00:21.21,00:00:21.21,back to camp by yourself? >> Why can't I?
11,00:00:22.96,00:00:22.96,>> Angie wanted to quit. She's one of those folks
12,00:00:24.71,00:00:24.71,"that says, ""I can't do this."" >> JEFF: At Koror, Willard's"
13,00:00:28.08,00:00:28.08,work ethic was questioned when he failed to tend to the fire.
14,00:00:31.21,00:00:31.21,">> Willard's been getting a free ride, and he's been able"
15,00:00:33.75,00:00:33.75,to play this game a lot longer than he should.
16,00:00:36.08,00:00:36.08,">> JEFF: At the challenge... Win or lose, both tribes"
17,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,are going to Tribal Council tonight.
18,00:00:41.54,00:00:41.54,The winning tribe will vote somebody out.
19,00:00:44.38,00:00:44.38,"They will then cross to the jury side,"
20,00:00:46.12,00:00:46.12,help themselves to some stew and root beer and listen in
21,00:00:50.58,00:00:50.58,as the losing tribe has their Tribal Council.
22,00:00:53.50,00:00:53.50,Ibrehem down. Ibrehem failed to retrieve
23,00:00:56.71,00:00:56.71,"a bottle. >> Come on, Ib!"
24,00:01:00.46,00:01:00.46,>> JEFF: Koror wins reward. >> Get on the raft!
25,00:01:04.75,00:01:04.75,>> JEFF: At Ulong... >> I can't believe we lost.
26,00:01:07.04,00:01:07.04,>> JEFF: Ibrehem's mistake was hard to overlook.
27,00:01:09.88,00:01:09.88,">> We had it in the bag. Then Ibrehem, we lost because of"
28,00:01:13.25,00:01:13.25,him. He's history.
29,00:01:17.46,00:01:17.46,">> JEFF: Jubilation turned to paranoia, as Koror faced"
30,00:01:20.21,00:01:20.21,"their first Tribal Council. >> He's out, right?"
31,00:01:21.67,00:01:21.67,>> Yeah. ( indistinct voices )
32,00:01:24.75,00:01:24.75,>> Don't tell anyone. >> I won't.
33,00:01:26.12,00:01:26.12,>> JEFF: And Gregg let Coby in on his plan with Jenn.
34,00:01:28.46,00:01:28.46,"Once Willard and Caryn are gone, it becomes seven people,"
35,00:01:32.54,00:01:32.54,"me, Jenn, you and Janu. Then we start picking"
36,00:01:36.25,00:01:36.25,them off. >> I'm very excited.
37,00:01:38.21,00:01:38.21,I love that the game is going to a new level.
38,00:01:40.21,00:01:40.21,I can't wait. >> JEFF: At Koror's first
39,00:01:43.17,00:01:43.17,Tribal Council... Fifth person voted out
40,00:01:45.08,00:01:45.08,of Survivor Palau... Willard was voted out.
41,00:01:47.62,00:01:47.62,"The tribe has spoken. Koror, go ahead and pull off"
42,00:01:51.58,00:01:51.58,the cover. Koror then dug into their beef
43,00:01:53.79,00:01:53.79,stew reward in front of a dejected Ulong tribe.
44,00:01:57.50,00:01:57.50,>> Oh! >> It was really close today.
45,00:02:00.29,00:02:00.29,We really needed this. >> It seems like all I've heard
46,00:02:03.21,00:02:03.21,"today is ""Wow, we could have really been eating that beef"
47,00:02:05.71,00:02:05.71,"stew right now,"" like that's the end of the game,"
48,00:02:07.50,00:02:07.50,like beef stew is it. >> JEFF: And with Ibrehem on
49,00:02:10.08,00:02:10.08,"the chopping block, there was one more surprise."
50,00:02:12.21,00:02:12.21,"Koror, you are going to vote to give immunity"
51,00:02:15.12,00:02:15.12,to one person from Ulong. Koror voted and gave immunity
52,00:02:18.50,00:02:18.50,to Ibrehem. With a wrench thrown into
53,00:02:21.04,00:02:21.04,"Ulong's plans, Bobby Jon and Angie each received two votes."
54,00:02:25.42,00:02:25.42,We have a tie. Stephenie had first voted for
55,00:02:29.12,00:02:29.12,"Bobby Jon, but in the tiebreaker she changed her vote, and Angie"
56,00:02:33.21,00:02:33.21,was voted out. The tribe has spoken.
57,00:02:36.88,00:02:36.88,12 are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
58,00:03:19.50,00:03:19.50,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
59,00:04:11.50,00:04:11.50,>> That may have been the craziest Tribal Council
60,00:04:13.50,00:04:13.50,"I've ever been to. From walking in, believing"
61,00:04:17.08,00:04:17.08,"that I was going to be voted off,"
62,00:04:19.04,00:04:19.04,but then the tide got turned and the other tribe ended up
63,00:04:21.83,00:04:21.83,"giving me immunity. And, uh, someone else ended up"
64,00:04:24.67,00:04:24.67,getting voted off instead of me. >> I think for the next
65,00:04:27.46,00:04:27.46,"challenge, not only do we need to have great listening"
66,00:04:30.38,00:04:30.38,"skills, because I'm also... >> Yeah, everybody needs to"
67,00:04:32.54,00:04:32.54,"listen. >> I mean, like..."
68,00:04:34.33,00:04:34.33,>> Keep your ears open and listen to your teammates.
69,00:04:37.25,00:04:37.25,">> Tonight at Tribal Council, Ib got the immunity."
70,00:04:39.38,00:04:39.38,"So, um, Angie was the one that ended up going."
71,00:04:41.21,00:04:41.21,"But you know, he knew was gonna get voted off,"
72,00:04:43.50,00:04:43.50,"and he knows he's going next, 'cause I'm not changing my mind."
73,00:04:46.08,00:04:46.08,"So we'll see what happens. >> I was pissed at you, really."
74,00:04:51.25,00:04:51.25,You wasn't paying attention today.
75,00:04:53.08,00:04:53.08,That was your problem. >> Okay.
76,00:04:55.00,00:04:55.00,>> Okay? You cost us the game because
77,00:04:58.62,00:04:58.62,you didn't pay attention. All you had to do was
78,00:05:01.54,00:05:01.54,"yank on the bottle. >> Yeah, you're right."
79,00:05:03.04,00:05:03.04,>> You were yanking on the rope.
80,00:05:04.04,00:05:04.04,">> No, ain't none of us perfect. >> You should have been at"
81,00:05:06.92,00:05:06.92,"least honest and, uh... >> About what?"
82,00:05:08.42,00:05:08.42,>> ...told us that you couldn't dive down deep enough
83,00:05:11.04,00:05:11.04,to get the bottle. >> Didn't I tell you I was
84,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,"honest about it? I told you, if you was"
85,00:05:14.88,00:05:14.88,"listening, I said I dove down I was at two bottles,"
86,00:05:16.79,00:05:16.79,"and I tried to pull the rope. >> Yeah, all we know is"
87,00:05:18.79,00:05:18.79,"you went down three times, didn't come up with a bottle."
88,00:05:20.92,00:05:20.92,">> Bottom line is, we just need to win now."
89,00:05:22.92,00:05:22.92,'Cause we really can't afford to lose anybody else.
90,00:05:24.96,00:05:24.96,"I mean for real. >> And you need to focus,"
91,00:05:27.88,00:05:27.88,you know. >> James just kind of put
92,00:05:30.38,00:05:30.38,Ibrehem on the spot. I mean...
93,00:05:32.25,00:05:32.25,"I don't agree with that, you know."
94,00:05:34.83,00:05:34.83,"I mean, we win as a team and lose as a team."
95,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,"Yeah, he-he missed the bottle, and we didn't win the beef stew."
96,00:05:40.50,00:05:40.50,"I mean, whatever, you know. You can't get over"
97,00:05:44.12,00:05:44.12,beef and stew? Please.
98,00:05:57.88,00:05:57.88,>> A lot of times I'm able to get off on my own away by
99,00:06:01.54,00:06:01.54,myself and actually do my prayers.
100,00:06:08.08,00:06:08.08,"I think if things would have just stayed on track at Tribal,"
101,00:06:10.83,00:06:10.83,I'm pretty sure I-I probably wouldn't be here right now.
102,00:06:13.88,00:06:13.88,"I don't know. The way things happen,"
103,00:06:16.21,00:06:16.21,I almost think God had a hand in it.
104,00:06:18.33,00:06:18.33,I feel like I'm definitely meant to be here.
105,00:06:22.04,00:06:22.04,I think you appreciate things a little more when it's almost
106,00:06:25.21,00:06:25.21,"taken away from you, so I think I got"
107,00:06:27.54,00:06:27.54,a whole new grasp on it. >> Last night was the first
108,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,"Tribal Council, and we had to vote somebody off, which"
109,00:06:55.46,00:06:55.46,"ended up being Willard. And then, we got to eat our"
110,00:06:59.12,00:06:59.12,"stew. Right away, you started, you"
111,00:07:01.00,00:07:01.00,felt this rush of energy back. And the crew woke up
112,00:07:03.62,00:07:03.62,this morning very charged up and refreshed.
113,00:07:06.38,00:07:06.38,And it's just another day in paradise today.
114,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,">> Idle hands are the devil's plaything, you know."
115,00:07:14.12,00:07:14.12,"You know what? It's a different day, you know."
116,00:07:17.12,00:07:17.12,"We all got fed, everyone's got a little energy,"
117,00:07:19.04,00:07:19.04,and everyone's doing a project. Today is a day just to kind of
118,00:07:22.75,00:07:22.75,do something to save ourselves some work down the road.
119,00:07:26.08,00:07:26.08,>> What do you think? >> That's pretty.
120,00:07:31.38,00:07:31.38,That's so cool. Camp Koror had craft day.
121,00:07:36.75,00:07:36.75,"Well, just Katie; everybody else was working."
122,00:07:38.88,00:07:38.88,"Didn't help with the fire, didn't go hunt,"
123,00:07:42.04,00:07:42.04,"didn't go do anything. But she made necklaces,"
124,00:07:44.12,00:07:44.12,"God love her. Actually, more of a headband."
125,00:07:48.08,00:07:48.08,">> I feel great, I really do. I thought it'd be harder than"
126,00:07:50.17,00:07:50.17,"this. And it will be,"
127,00:07:52.25,00:07:52.25,and I'm prepared for that. So I think that if you keep
128,00:07:54.42,00:07:54.42,"that state of mind, then you can survive."
129,00:07:57.04,00:07:57.04,>> It's pretty. >> So what do you do after
130,00:07:59.62,00:07:59.62,you get the three...? >> You just start
131,00:08:01.21,00:08:01.21,tying them together. >> I would like to see Katie
132,00:08:04.04,00:08:04.04,work a little harder and move a little faster.
133,00:08:06.88,00:08:06.88,It appears that she's just here to entertain.
134,00:08:09.21,00:08:09.21,"She sings, she's cheerful, she makes a lot of jokes."
135,00:08:12.50,00:08:12.50,But what is her role here? I don't know.
136,00:08:18.71,00:08:18.71,>> I'm so sad! >> Boo-hoo!
137,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,"( shouting ) >> My name is Angie, and I can"
138,00:08:25.25,00:08:25.25,smell the stew. ( laughter )
139,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,">> I'm Bobby Jon. I love everyone,"
140,00:08:30.04,00:08:30.04,and I look like Jesus Christ. ( laughter )
141,00:08:32.42,00:08:32.42,Waaah...! Waaah...!
142,00:08:40.83,00:08:40.83,>> Open the box. Ooh.
143,00:08:45.21,00:08:45.21,( gasps ) Pringle!
144,00:08:49.58,00:08:49.58,Tree mail! >> Tree mail!
145,00:08:52.54,00:08:52.54,>> Guess what it has on it? >> Guess!
146,00:08:54.96,00:08:54.96,"It starts with a P! >> And ends with a ""le""!"
147,00:09:00.67,00:09:00.67,Pringle! >> Pringle?
148,00:09:02.75,00:09:02.75,>> Pringle? Oh.
149,00:09:06.08,00:09:06.08,">> ""Ready, aim, fire. ""You'll each get a shot."
150,00:09:09.58,00:09:09.58,">> Yeah! >> ""Make sure it's a good one,"
151,00:09:11.71,00:09:11.71,"you'll be bummed if it's not. ""No strength required,"
152,00:09:15.50,00:09:15.50,a steady hand to compete. See the wonders

154,00:09:21.46,00:09:21.46,"a treat."" ( cheering )"
155,00:09:23.54,00:09:23.54,">> So, it sounds like it's going to be some sort"
156,00:09:25.08,00:09:25.08,of shooting competition. We don't know whether
157,00:09:27.12,00:09:27.12,"or not it's bow and arrow, we don't know if it's slingshot,"
158,00:09:29.46,00:09:29.46,"gun. But, yeah, we really"
159,00:09:31.29,00:09:31.29,want to win this. ( all growling )
160,00:09:39.71,00:09:39.71,">> JEFF: Come on in, Koror. Koror getting your first look"
161,00:09:48.17,00:09:48.17,at the new Ulong tribe. Angie voted out at the last
162,00:09:52.46,00:09:52.46,Tribal Council. >> Ready for today's challenge?
163,00:09:59.42,00:09:59.42,>> Yes. >> JEFF: There are 16

166,00:10:09.62,00:10:09.62,you're going to attempt to knock out your tribe tiles.

169,00:10:19.04,00:10:19.04,for? >> Yeah.
170,00:10:20.75,00:10:20.75,">> JEFF: Well, it started this morning with your tree mail."
171,00:10:22.75,00:10:22.75,Pringles is part of your reward. The winning tribe will leave
172,00:10:26.67,00:10:26.67,"here and you will board a very unique, one-of-a-kind"
173,00:10:28.79,00:10:28.79,"Japanese boat. On board, you'll have"
174,00:10:31.08,00:10:31.08,"Pringles and mai-tais. >> Oh, my God!"
175,00:10:37.83,00:10:37.83,">> JEFF: While you're relaxing, you'll cruise out to a body of"
176,00:10:41.42,00:10:41.42,water called Jellyfish Lake. It is literally home
177,00:10:44.50,00:10:44.50,to millions of jellyfish. You're gonna snorkel
178,00:10:48.54,00:10:48.54,"with the jellyfish. And the good news is,"
179,00:10:51.04,00:10:51.04,they can't hurt you. They have lost their necessity
180,00:10:53.33,00:10:53.33,and their ability to sting. You've never seen anything
181,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,"like this. You'll be rejuvenated,"

273,00:17:44.25,00:17:44.25,"much, and I hate that feeling. Hello, Pringles and mai-tais..."

275,00:17:49.50,00:17:49.50,"I knew that we needed this to boost our spirits and morale,"

304,00:19:13.04,00:19:13.04,it's just crystal clear. It's just amazing to know that
305,00:19:16.46,00:19:16.46,you're about to go somewhere where all these jellyfish
306,00:19:18.46,00:19:18.46,"are at, and none of them can sting you 'cause they lost their"
307,00:19:20.21,00:19:20.21,"stinging tentacles, because they're in fresh water,"
308,00:19:22.50,00:19:22.50,and they've been there for millions of years.

312,00:19:42.75,00:19:42.75,they're just all just coming at you.
313,00:19:44.29,00:19:44.29,It's just... It's kind of like
314,00:19:45.75,00:19:45.75,a euphoric type of feeling. And I just kind of wanted
315,00:19:48.08,00:19:48.08,"to cherish every second, 'cause I was at a place"
316,00:19:50.62,00:19:50.62,in this world where I won't ever go again.

329,00:20:57.88,00:20:57.88,"wind has picked up to a point. I mean, this-this feels"
330,00:21:00.67,00:21:00.67,like about a 40-mile-an-hour wind right now.
331,00:21:03.04,00:21:03.04,"It's really gusting hard. Oh, God!"
332,00:21:05.58,00:21:05.58,"Are you, like, kidding me? ( rumbling thunder )"

336,00:21:28.58,00:21:28.58,That was absolute torture. >> Last night was the first
337,00:21:32.33,00:21:32.33,night I think that I've ever had where I felt so vulnerable.
338,00:21:35.83,00:21:35.83,I just felt very alone and scared.
339,00:21:38.71,00:21:38.71,"But, I mean, I ended up getting through the night,"
340,00:21:40.21,00:21:40.21,but it kind of just has lingered on into the day.
341,00:21:51.00,00:21:51.00,>> Hang in there. This is...
342,00:21:52.79,00:21:52.79,It's a bad day. I feel the same way.
343,00:21:54.25,00:21:54.25,I'm so far away from my family today that I'm down.

360,00:22:52.17,00:22:52.17,dramatic with Janu. So I thought I was

376,00:23:59.04,00:23:59.04,I learned this in the Navy. They're not going to find a

381,00:24:13.04,00:24:13.04,>> James says he was in the Navy.
382,00:24:15.08,00:24:15.08,We spent a lot of time tying this one knot that he says like
383,00:24:18.71,00:24:18.71,"that when you pull on it, that it's just going to get"
384,00:24:21.21,00:24:21.21,"real, real tighter. He took the lead."
385,00:24:22.96,00:24:22.96,"And he acted like he knew what he was doing,"
386,00:24:25.21,00:24:25.21,"so, you know, I followed. >> Wait a minute."
387,00:24:27.25,00:24:27.25,What the hell? Where's the end?
388,00:24:28.42,00:24:28.42,>> Regulators! >> I'm pretty sure
389,00:24:31.67,00:24:31.67,"this is ours the taking, so... we're gonna win."
390,00:24:56.42,00:24:56.42,">> JEFF: All right, first things first."
391,00:24:58.29,00:24:58.29,"Janu, give it up. Immunity is back up for grabs."
392,00:25:05.04,00:25:05.04,"All right, today's immunity challenge began this morning"
393,00:25:07.71,00:25:07.71,with your tree mail. You each received
394,00:25:09.29,00:25:09.29,a footlocker and some rope. Inside the footlocker
395,00:25:12.12,00:25:12.12,was the opposing tribe's flag. You were instructed to use that
396,00:25:15.71,00:25:15.71,rope and make the footlocker as impenetrable as you could.
397,00:25:19.50,00:25:19.50,The challenge continues. Now you'll have 20 minutes
398,00:25:22.50,00:25:22.50,"to swim out, retrieve three bundles of lumber,"
399,00:25:26.00,00:25:26.00,build a fortress around this footlocker
400,00:25:28.25,00:25:28.25,to make it even more difficult to get into.
401,00:25:30.50,00:25:30.50,"After 20 minutes, we'll stop, switch sides and each tribe"
402,00:25:33.71,00:25:33.71,will attempt to undo what the other tribe
403,00:25:36.29,00:25:36.29,has just done. First tribe to release their
404,00:25:39.12,00:25:39.12,"flag, secure it to the flag pole and raise it to the top"
405,00:25:43.21,00:25:43.21,"wins immunity. Koror, the four people"
406,00:25:45.04,00:25:45.04,who sat out the last challenge are in this one--
407,00:25:47.62,00:25:47.62,"Jenn, Katie, Janu and Ian. Everybody else take"
408,00:25:50.54,00:25:50.54,a spot on the bench. Let's go.
409,00:25:54.58,00:25:54.58,"Here we go, for immunity. Survivors ready?"
410,00:25:58.92,00:25:58.92,Go! Ulong sending three people out.
411,00:26:08.25,00:26:08.25,Koror sending just two. Katie and Janu adding more
412,00:26:13.71,00:26:13.71,knots. James getting a game plan for
413,00:26:15.08,00:26:15.08,Ulong. Starts with keeping his toga on.
414,00:26:17.50,00:26:17.50,>> Ready? Pull.
415,00:26:19.92,00:26:19.92,I got this one. >> JEFF: Bobby Jon and Steph
416,00:26:23.33,00:26:23.33,coming back with the first load. Ibrehem waiting in the middle.
417,00:26:26.33,00:26:26.33,I'll pass it to you. >> Yeah.
418,00:26:27.75,00:26:27.75,Tell James to get close to shore.
419,00:26:29.12,00:26:29.12,>> JEFF: Katie and Janu already doing a lot of rope work.
420,00:26:31.46,00:26:31.46,"The more knots, the more difficult"
421,00:26:32.58,00:26:32.58,it's going to be to untie. James in no hurry at all.
422,00:26:40.25,00:26:40.25,Ulong coming back with all three bundles at once.
423,00:26:44.04,00:26:44.04,James gives up on the toga. Jenn back with a load for Koror.
424,00:26:49.04,00:26:49.04,You have 20 minutes to get this thing
425,00:26:51.67,00:26:51.67,as impenetrable as possible. Need to pick it up.
426,00:26:54.88,00:26:54.88,Ulong starting to work on their fortress.
427,00:27:00.54,00:27:00.54,">> Good knot. Make sure it's on the other end,"
428,00:27:02.88,00:27:02.88,too. >> JEFF: Steph getting
429,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,her teeth involved. Ian back with the last load
430,00:27:08.04,00:27:08.04,of lumber for Koror. Koror finally getting to work
431,00:27:14.25,00:27:14.25,"on their fortress. >> JEFF: Ten minutes down,"
432,00:27:20.79,00:27:20.79,ten minutes to go. >> Come on.
433,00:27:26.21,00:27:26.21,">> JEFF: Five minutes left. Five minutes, we will switch"
434,00:27:29.38,00:27:29.38,"sides, and you will have to untie what the other tribe has"
435,00:27:32.25,00:27:32.25,done. One minute left.
436,00:27:35.71,00:27:35.71,Ulong has used every piece of rope they have.
437,00:27:41.33,00:27:41.33,Koror still has quite a bit of rope left.
438,00:27:45.42,00:27:45.42,Ulong shoving every piece of lumber they can.
439,00:27:48.25,00:27:48.25,Koror doing the same thing. Two big disaster piles.
440,00:27:54.21,00:27:54.21,"Five, four, three, two, one. Everybody stop."
441,00:28:07.58,00:28:07.58,"All right, on my ""go,"" you will switch sides"
442,00:28:09.92,00:28:09.92,and start untying. First tribe to get
443,00:28:12.25,00:28:12.25,their flag free and up the flag pole
444,00:28:14.83,00:28:14.83,"wins immunity. Be tigers, guys!"
445,00:28:16.21,00:28:16.21,Survivors ready? Go!
446,00:28:21.17,00:28:21.17,Now we're going to find out who did a better job
447,00:28:23.96,00:28:23.96,of securing their footlocker. No time limit here.
448,00:28:26.00,00:28:26.00,It is simply the first tribe to finish.
449,00:28:32.75,00:28:32.75,Both tribes making good progress.
450,00:28:35.33,00:28:35.33,Koror used a lot of wood and a lot of knots.
451,00:28:40.67,00:28:40.67,Steph not impressed with Koror's knots.
452,00:28:41.92,00:28:41.92,Ulong appears to have a bit of a lead.
453,00:28:48.79,00:28:48.79,Ian takes care of the big rope with no trouble.
454,00:28:51.17,00:28:51.17,>> But that's what's in it. >> Keep doing that.
455,00:28:54.96,00:28:54.96,>> JEFF: Ulong starting to slow down.
456,00:28:59.92,00:28:59.92,"Koror getting closer. >> TOM: Good, Koror!"
457,00:29:03.42,00:29:03.42,>> There you go! Yeah!
458,00:29:04.96,00:29:04.96,>> JEFF: Koror getting very close.
459,00:29:07.08,00:29:07.08,Koror has their footlocker! Come on.
460,00:29:10.33,00:29:10.33,( indistinct shouting ) Now you've got to untie it.
461,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,Ulong getting closer to releasing their footlocker.
462,00:29:16.17,00:29:16.17,"You guys need to keep moving. Pull, pull, pull!"
463,00:29:18.04,00:29:18.04,You're waltzing. >> Slow and steady.
464,00:29:20.67,00:29:20.67,Just maintain that work. >> JEFF: Both tribes working
465,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,on their footlocker. This is where all your earlier
466,00:29:26.12,00:29:26.12,knot tying is going to pay off. Ulong working together well.
467,00:29:31.38,00:29:31.38,Got to get that footlocker open. Koror getting closer and closer.
468,00:29:34.83,00:29:34.83,"Ulong with a lot of knots to get undone,"
469,00:29:38.25,00:29:38.25,but they're moving quickly. >> Yeah!
470,00:29:41.96,00:29:41.96,>> JEFF: Ulong still working strong.
471,00:29:43.46,00:29:43.46,You're still in it. Koror getting closer and closer.
472,00:29:47.42,00:29:47.42,Ulong not giving up. Immunity at stake.
473,00:29:51.21,00:29:51.21,Tribal Council awaits. Somebody going home.
474,00:29:55.58,00:29:55.58,Koror literally down to their last few knots.
475,00:29:58.04,00:29:58.04,>> GREGG: There you go! >> JEFF: Koror has their
476,00:30:05.17,00:30:05.17,flag free. Got to get it up the flag pole!
477,00:30:11.67,00:30:11.67,>> GREGG: There we are! >> JEFF: Koror wins their fifth
478,00:30:14.38,00:30:14.38,"straight immunity challenge! All right, Ulong."
479,00:30:18.58,00:30:18.58,">> Oh, great job. >> Nice."
480,00:30:20.67,00:30:20.67,">> Great job. >> JEFF: Koror, you have yet to"
481,00:30:23.46,00:30:23.46,lose an immunity challenge. ( whooping )
482,00:30:26.83,00:30:26.83,">> JEFF: No Tribal Council, nobody going home."
483,00:30:30.08,00:30:30.08,"Ulong, you have yet to win an immunity challenge."
484,00:30:33.17,00:30:33.17,"Next Tribal Council, somebody going home."
485,00:30:35.25,00:30:35.25,This tribe will be down to three.
486,00:30:37.33,00:30:37.33,Head on back. See you at Tribal Council
487,00:30:39.08,00:30:39.08,tomorrow night. >> We ended up losing
488,00:31:18.75,00:31:18.75,another immunity challenge. Ulong hasn't won an immunity
489,00:31:23.29,00:31:23.29,challenge yet this whole game. When it comes to
490,00:31:26.62,00:31:26.62,"tonight at Tribal, the only criteria"
491,00:31:28.42,00:31:28.42,I'm going to go with is whoever I think
492,00:31:30.67,00:31:30.67,has done the worst out of all these
493,00:31:32.71,00:31:32.71,immunity challenges. So it will most likely
494,00:31:34.54,00:31:34.54,be for James. >> Ibrehem has overstayed
495,00:32:08.12,00:32:08.12,his welcome. He was meant to go last time.
496,00:32:11.08,00:32:11.08,"And by the grace of Allah, he didn't go."
497,00:32:16.12,00:32:16.12,"Well, my god says he is today. I got two votes the other"
498,00:32:26.58,00:32:26.58,"night at Tribal Council, and I know Angie was one."
499,00:32:30.21,00:32:30.21,"but I thought Stephenie was the other, but it wasn't Stephenie."
500,00:32:33.04,00:32:33.04,"I'm thinking it was James, and it was male handwriting."
501,00:32:36.25,00:32:36.25,So I'm thinking James threw a dart at me and I'm going
502,00:32:39.21,00:32:39.21,to throw one at him. >> She had to go.
503,00:33:04.04,00:33:04.04,"We couldn't lose you. I don't like to lie,"
504,00:33:07.38,00:33:07.38,but this was in the midst of we were deciding who we were
505,00:33:10.04,00:33:10.04,"gonna vote out tonight, so there's no way in hell I"
506,00:33:12.25,00:33:12.25,"could have told him the truth. So I said, ""I swear to God"
507,00:33:14.71,00:33:14.71,"it wasn't me."" I..."
508,00:33:17.38,00:33:17.38,"It was a close one. >> Yeah, it was."
509,00:33:21.00,00:33:21.00,">> I feel really bad lying about it,"
510,00:33:23.00,00:33:23.00,"but if I would have told him the truth,"
511,00:33:24.88,00:33:24.88,they would have voted me off tonight.
512,00:33:26.25,00:33:26.25,He would never be able to trust me.
513,00:33:29.17,00:33:29.17,"Either way, somebody's going to get their feelings hurt."
514,00:33:32.38,00:33:32.38,">> Yeah. I swear to God, I voted"
515,00:33:35.21,00:33:35.21,"for Angie, though. That's right."
516,00:33:47.46,00:33:47.46,">> So I said to Bobby Jon, ""Well, what if it's a tie?"
517,00:33:50.04,00:33:50.04,"""Then what are we gonna do? We're gonna put"
518,00:33:51.92,00:33:51.92,"our butts on the line?"" And he assured me that"
519,00:33:54.25,00:33:54.25,he wanted to make an alliance with me that if I vote
520,00:33:57.54,00:33:57.54,"for James tonight, he wants to vote Ibrehem out next."
521,00:34:01.42,00:34:01.42,Okay. I'll vote for James with you.
522,00:34:05.17,00:34:05.17,>> Right. >> That's only if you promise
523,00:34:06.50,00:34:06.50,"if the three of us are still here, you and I will"
524,00:34:09.12,00:34:09.12,go to the end... >> We'll go to the end.
525,00:34:10.88,00:34:10.88,"and we'll vote Ib off. Yeah, we'll do that."
526,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,'Cause I think we deserve it the best.
527,00:34:14.71,00:34:14.71,">> Yeah, I know we do. >> Okay."
528,00:34:16.21,00:34:16.21,"Well, then, that's what we'll do."
529,00:34:18.96,00:34:18.96,">> At this point in the game, I'm looking in the future,"
530,00:34:21.58,00:34:21.58,and I don't think I can get to the end
531,00:34:23.92,00:34:23.92,"with Ibrehem. So, it will definitely be"
532,00:34:25.62,00:34:25.62,me and Stephenie all the way to the end.
533,00:34:29.29,00:34:29.29,"If she's playing me, we'll find out,"
534,00:34:32.42,00:34:32.42,but I don't think she is. >> I'm between two sides
535,00:34:40.21,00:34:40.21,right now. Because I can stick with James
536,00:34:42.58,00:34:42.58,"and it will be a tie, or go with Bobby Jon and Ib,"
537,00:34:45.79,00:34:45.79,"vote off James, and then persuade Bobby Jon"
538,00:34:49.46,00:34:49.46,"to stick with his word, and next time, Ib will go."
539,00:34:54.96,00:34:54.96,I really don't know where I stand right now.
540,00:35:34.25,00:35:34.25,>> JEFF: James? >> Yo.
541,00:35:35.04,00:35:35.04,>> JEFF: You have not won a single immunity challenge.
542,00:35:39.29,00:35:39.29,>> I tell you what... >> JEFF: Tell me something.
543,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,"When we hear the word ""immunity,"" I think we"
544,00:35:46.17,00:35:46.17,subconsciously sabotage ourselves.
545,00:35:50.71,00:35:50.71,">> JEFF: Well, let's talk about that."
546,00:35:52.46,00:35:52.46,Do you guys think you gave 100% the last immunity challenge?
547,00:35:54.58,00:35:54.58,"I mean, I sat there and watched. >> Oh, yeah..."
548,00:35:58.12,00:35:58.12,>> JEFF: Steph and Bobby Jon swam out.
549,00:35:59.38,00:35:59.38,"Ibrehem took a leisurely stroll to the middle, doing what,"
550,00:36:01.96,00:36:01.96,I'm still not sure. And you sat back there
551,00:36:04.46,00:36:04.46,"messing with your skirt for two, three, four minutes."
552,00:36:07.33,00:36:07.33,>> Wow. >> JEFF: That's when
553,00:36:09.33,00:36:09.33,"you lost the challenge. >> Well, that's not what held"
554,00:36:11.58,00:36:11.58,"us up. >> JEFF: Ibrehem, last Tribal"
555,00:36:14.75,00:36:14.75,Council it looked like you were this close to being gone.
556,00:36:18.08,00:36:18.08,"Have you ever thought, these first few days out here,"
557,00:36:21.17,00:36:21.17,"""Maybe I'm just not cut out for this game?"
558,00:36:23.04,00:36:23.04,">> Uh, actually, I've never thought like that."
559,00:36:25.12,00:36:25.12,Um... It's really opened my eyes
560,00:36:28.88,00:36:28.88,"to what I can do, rather than what I can't handle."
561,00:36:31.38,00:36:31.38,">> JEFF: James, if you hold the same criteria that"
562,00:36:33.62,00:36:33.62,"you were holding to Ibrehem from last Tribal Council,"
563,00:36:36.75,00:36:36.75,do you think it's fair to base a vote simply on how
564,00:36:39.12,00:36:39.12,"you performed in a challenge? >> No, it's not fair to go ahead"
565,00:36:42.21,00:36:42.21,and just base my vote directly towards a challenge.
566,00:36:45.08,00:36:45.08,"It's camp life, personality. Do I get along with this person?"
567,00:36:48.79,00:36:48.79,Do I have personal feelings for this person? You know.
568,00:36:51.17,00:36:51.17,">> JEFF: Steph, you guys have to be fighting for"

573,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,here being that tribe that never won immunity.
574,00:37:05.54,00:37:05.54,That's like a disgrace. >> JEFF: Bobby Jon?
575,00:37:07.46,00:37:07.46,">> Yes, sir. >> JEFF: Do you trust these"

577,00:37:12.50,00:37:12.50,you shouldn't be in a tribe with them.

579,00:37:16.25,00:37:16.25,and I do trust every one of them.

583,00:37:24.21,00:37:24.21,">> Absolutely. And, uh, when I get"
584,00:37:26.83,00:37:26.83,"someone's word and I give them my word, I hope that they, you"
585,00:37:30.12,00:37:30.12,"know, take it, and, so, I do trust them."
586,00:37:34.67,00:37:34.67,">> JEFF: You three guys are all from, basically, the same part"
587,00:37:36.67,00:37:36.67,"of the country, right? >> Pretty much."

589,00:37:40.08,00:37:40.08,>> JEFF: Steph. A little bit of a concern
590,00:37:42.38,00:37:42.38,that if you're looking for some way to divide

594,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,"that I've worked my butt off, and I've done the best I could,"
595,00:37:55.25,00:37:55.25,"and I've done really well so far, so I just feel like"
596,00:37:59.38,00:37:59.38,"it's really not my time yet, and I just hope that"
597,00:38:02.21,00:38:02.21,"they see that, too. >> JEFF: Okay, it is time to"
598,00:38:05.00,00:38:05.00,"vote. Bobby Jon, you're up."

646,00:43:08.25,00:43:08.25,But I've accomplished things that not many people

648,00:43:14.04,00:43:14.04,I am glad that I got a chance to go on Survivor and see if
649,00:43:17.58,00:43:17.58,I had what it takes.
