696,00:29:31.75,00:29:31.75,THEY WON'T SEE THAT COMING.
697,00:29:37.00,00:29:37.00,THAT'S VERY SMART.

728,00:30:45.17,00:30:45.17,GOING WITH ZAPATERA.
729,00:30:46.21,00:30:46.21,"FIRST OF ALL, HE HAS THE"
730,00:30:48.04,00:30:48.04,AUDACITY TO THINK THAT HE'S

733,00:30:52.71,00:30:52.71,AND THEN THE STUPIDITY TO TELL ME THAT.
734,00:30:55.21,00:30:55.21,IT JUST CONFIRMED HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED.
735,00:30:57.08,00:30:57.08,"SO BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GIVING"
736,00:30:58.92,00:30:58.92,HIM A ONE-WAY TICKET BACK TO REDEMPTION ISLAND.

743,00:31:21.08,00:31:21.08,"I KNOW THEY WANTED TO BRING YOU IN, BUT I'M NOT FLIPPING."
744,00:31:24.62,00:31:24.62,WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.

762,00:32:05.92,00:32:05.92,HE TOLD ME THAT HIM AND ANDREA
763,00:32:08.29,00:32:08.29,WERE GOING TO JOIN UP WITH THEM.
764,00:32:10.25,00:32:10.25,>> ARE YOU SERIOUS! >> YUP.

778,00:32:47.38,00:32:47.38,IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO HAVE AT THIS POINT.
779,00:32:50.29,00:32:50.29,SO I THINK HE KNOWS THAT HE
780,00:32:52.67,00:32:52.67,COULD POTENTIALLY BE ON THE
781,00:32:55.12,00:32:55.12,CHOPPING BLOCK WITH THE OMETEPE TRIBE.
782,00:32:57.29,00:32:57.29,YOU AND ANDREA NEED TO JUMP WITH US
783,00:32:59.21,00:32:59.21,BECAUSE YOU'LL GO MUCH FURTHER THAN YOU WILL WITH THEM.
784,00:33:01.17,00:33:01.17,"I GUARANTEE YOU, ROB HAS GOTTEN GUYS IN A PECKING ORDER."
785,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,">> I KNOW, I'M SIXTH."

822,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,SO IT MIGHT BE THE WISEST MOVE
823,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,TO FLIP WITH MATT BECAUSE I
824,00:35:06.71,00:35:06.71,COULD BE NEXT TO GO.

844,00:36:02.25,00:36:02.25,AND WE WERE SOAK WET WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF RAIN LAST NIGHT.
845,00:36:05.21,00:36:05.21,">> WE WON THE TARP, FIRST OF ALL,"
846,00:36:06.79,00:36:06.79,SO IF WE CHOOSE TO SLEEP UNDER THE TARP--
847,00:36:09.46,00:36:09.46,>> I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THE ASTERISK--
848,00:36:10.79,00:36:10.79,"TO WIN, THAT I DIDN'T REALLY TRY TOO HARD."
849,00:36:12.12,00:36:12.12,>> Jeff: SO ZAPATERA DID THROW A CHALLENGE?
850,00:36:16.21,00:36:16.21,>> YES.
851,00:36:17.79,00:36:17.79,">> JEFF, THAT'S THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO TRIBES."
852,00:36:20.21,00:36:20.21,"BECAUSE-- >> OH, PLEASE! PLEASE."

854,00:36:23.38,00:36:23.38,I'LL BE COURTEOUS AND LET YOU SPEAK.
855,00:36:25.21,00:36:25.21,DON'T INTERRUPT.
856,00:36:25.88,00:36:25.88,WE WOULD NEVER NOT TRY.
857,00:36:29.08,00:36:29.08,"AND HERE'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT THAT, JEFF."
858,00:36:30.79,00:36:30.79,>> Jeff: PLEASE.
859,00:36:31.96,00:36:31.96,">> THERE ARE SOME ON THAT TRIBE, LIKE DECEIT."

863,00:36:41.00,00:36:41.00,LEAVES A STENCH SO GREAT.
864,00:36:44.88,00:36:44.88,YOU KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY
865,00:36:46.29,00:36:46.29,"CARRYING SOMETHING PARASITIC,"
866,00:36:47.71,00:36:47.71,"AND, THEREFORE, YOU DON'T WANT TO APROACH IT."
867,00:36:52.12,00:36:52.12,">> Jeff: NOW, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS LAUGHING AT?"
868,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,>> THAT. >> WHATEVER PHILLIP JUST SAID.
869,00:36:59.25,00:36:59.25,IT WAS FUNNY.
870,00:37:00.29,00:37:00.29,">> IT IS TWO DIFFERENT TRIBES,"
871,00:37:01.79,00:37:01.79,BUT I DON'T DISLIKE THEM AS PEOPLE.
872,00:37:04.17,00:37:04.17,I THINK WE'RE BOTH BEING LOYAL
873,00:37:05.75,00:37:05.75,TO THE TRIBES WE ORIGINATED
874,00:37:07.38,00:37:07.38,"WITH, AND THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO."
875,00:37:10.29,00:37:10.29,">> Jeff: AND, MATT, HERE ARE"
876,00:37:12.25,00:37:12.25,"YOU, FRESH BACK FROM REDEMPTION"

878,00:37:15.21,00:37:15.21,">> MAN, IT WAS SO MUCH EASIER ON REDEMPTION ISLAND."
879,00:37:17.79,00:37:17.79,JUST NOT HAVING ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND.
880,00:37:19.92,00:37:19.92,I'VE HAD SOME PRETTY WILD TRIBAL COUNCILS SO FAR.
881,00:37:23.17,00:37:23.17,I'M STARTING TO KIND OF HAVE A FUNNY FEELING ABOUT THIS PLACE.
882,00:37:26.71,00:37:26.71,">> Jeff: SO, MIKE, THERE ARE"
883,00:37:28.38,00:37:28.38,"SIX OMETEPE, FIVE ZAPATERA, AND MATT."
884,00:37:32.25,00:37:32.25,"OBVIOUSLY, HE'S A BIG VOTE."
885,00:37:34.21,00:37:34.21,>> ABSOLUTELY.
886,00:37:35.92,00:37:35.92,MATT IS THE MAN IN THE MIDDLE.
887,00:37:37.21,00:37:37.21,"YOU CAN SEE IT WEARING ON HIM,"
888,00:37:38.58,00:37:38.58,BUT EVERYTHING'S GOING TO FALL
889,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,OUT HERE AT THIS TRIBAL COUNCIL
890,00:37:41.79,00:37:41.79,AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHERE EVERYBODY STANDS.
891,00:37:43.08,00:37:43.08,">> Jeff: RALPH, WHAT DO YOU DO"
892,00:37:44.67,00:37:44.67,TO TRY TO CONVINCE MATT TO COME WITH YOU GUYS?
893,00:37:47.04,00:37:47.04,>> BE GOOD TO HIM.
894,00:37:48.12,00:37:48.12,TAKE HIM FURTHER IN THE GAME.
895,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,"THEY DONE CANNED HIM ONCE,"
896,00:37:50.04,00:37:50.04,SO THEY'LL PROBABLY DO IT AGAIN.
897,00:37:51.42,00:37:51.42,">> Jeff: MATT, FAIR ARGUMENT."
898,00:37:53.75,00:37:53.75,THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT VOTED YOU OUT.
899,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,WHY GO BACK TO THEM?
900,00:37:57.29,00:37:57.29,>> IT'S AN EXTREMELY FAIR
901,00:37:58.38,00:37:58.38,ARGUMENT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE
902,00:38:00.00,00:38:00.00,I'VE BEEN GONE THE PAST 15 DAYS.
903,00:38:02.21,00:38:02.21,IT'S NOT LIKE TIME STOPPED.
904,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,THEY CONTINUED TO GROW IN THEIR
905,00:38:05.42,00:38:05.42,RELATIONSHIPS AND GET CLOSER TOGETHER.
906,00:38:07.12,00:38:07.12,IT LOOKS LIKE I'M ON THE BOTTOM
907,00:38:09.29,00:38:09.29,"OF THE ALLIANCE HERE, AND HONESTLY, I STILL EVEN STRUGGLED"
908,00:38:12.29,00:38:12.29,TODAY WITH WHAT TO DO
909,00:38:13.58,00:38:13.58,BUT I'M STARTING TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.
910,00:38:18.83,00:38:18.83,">> Jeff: WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIG VOTE"
911,00:38:20.25,00:38:20.25,"AND, MATT, YOU ARE SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF IT."
912,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,"NATALIE HAS THE IMMUNITY NECKLACE,"
913,00:38:23.46,00:38:23.46,CANNOT VOTE FOR NATALIE.
914,00:38:25.46,00:38:25.46,EVERYBODY ELSE IS FAIR GAME.
915,00:38:27.08,00:38:27.08,IT'S TIME TO VOTE.
916,00:38:28.17,00:38:28.17,"NATALIE, YOU'RE UP."
917,00:39:23.58,00:39:23.58,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
918,00:39:30.58,00:39:30.58,IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL
919,00:39:32.00,00:39:32.00,YOU WANT TO PLAY IT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
920,00:39:45.04,00:39:45.04,>> I WANT TO PLAY THIS ON MIKE.
921,00:39:46.96,00:39:46.96,">> Jeff: OKAY, GIVING THIS TO MIKE."
922,00:39:51.29,00:39:51.29,THIS IS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL.
923,00:39:54.29,00:39:54.29,ANY VOTES CAST AGAINST MIKE WILL NOT COUNT.
924,00:40:00.21,00:40:00.21,"ONCE THE VOTE ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
925,00:40:02.12,00:40:02.12,PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
