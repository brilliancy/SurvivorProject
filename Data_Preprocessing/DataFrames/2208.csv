821,00:35:03.21,00:35:03.21,SO IT MIGHT BE THE WISEST MOVE

823,00:35:06.71,00:35:06.71,COULD BE NEXT TO GO.

845,00:36:06.79,00:36:06.79,SO IF WE CHOOSE TO SLEEPUNDER THE TARP--
846,00:36:09.46,00:36:09.46,>> I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THEASTERISK--
847,00:36:10.79,00:36:10.79,"TO WIN, THAT I DIDN'TREALLY TRY TOO HARD."
