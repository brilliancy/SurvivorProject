222,00:14:11.29,00:14:11.29,continuously scramble to makesure everything works in my

229,00:14:50.04,00:14:50.04,"more for me, actually.No one's washing my clothes."
230,00:14:54.75,00:14:54.75,I haven't gotten any specialmeals.
231,00:14:57.54,00:14:57.54,"I think if they really wanted myvote, they should probably do a"
232,00:15:00.38,00:15:00.38,"little more.I should probably be carried,"
233,00:15:02.54,00:15:02.54,"like, on a chariot-type thing.All right, ladies, I'm just"
234,00:15:22.08,00:15:22.08,"feeling a little bit nervous,and it's only because of the"
235,00:15:25.71,00:15:25.71,"relationships that you alreadyhave with James and you, Amanda,"
236,00:15:29.58,00:15:29.58,"have with Ozzy.But, Parvati, this James thing"
237,00:15:33.17,00:15:33.17,just kind of developed.>> Right.
238,00:15:44.12,00:15:44.12,>> That's the thing...>> I know.
239,00:15:49.25,00:15:49.25,>> I'm just going to put it outthere.
240,00:15:50.54,00:15:50.54,I like flirting with Ozzy.So if that makes you
241,00:15:52.29,00:15:52.29,"uncomfortable, then I'll, like,stop, but..."
242,00:15:54.25,00:15:54.25,">> No, no, no, no, don't change.>> No, because that's the way"
243,00:15:56.04,00:15:56.04,"you keep him close, you know?And he doesn't asks questions."
244,00:15:59.00,00:15:59.00,James asks me no questions.>> Are you nervous about her?
245,00:16:04.21,00:16:04.21,">> No, I'm not.>> She's like me a little."
246,00:16:08.00,00:16:08.00,She gets paranoid.She needs to be reassured a lot.
247,00:16:11.00,00:16:11.00,>> Let's reassure her.>> Okay.
248,00:16:13.12,00:16:13.12,But they're out there fillingher head with lies.
249,00:16:15.38,00:16:15.38,>> I want to vote Yau.>> You want to vote Yau?
250,00:16:17.83,00:16:17.83,>> Because if Yau goes to ExileIsland one time...
251,00:16:20.08,00:16:20.08,">> Oh, yeah.>> Going up against Yau..."
252,00:16:21.42,00:16:21.42,>> You'll never win.>> Yeah.
253,00:16:23.08,00:16:23.08,>> So I have both of you guys'word that it's us three to the
254,00:16:26.17,00:16:26.17,end.>> Yes.
255,00:16:27.46,00:16:27.46,>> Yeah.>> I don't care if James
256,00:16:29.00,00:16:29.00,proposes to you or you and Ozzyhave little Ozzlets.
257,00:16:31.88,00:16:31.88,">> Oh, you know how I am.>> All right."
258,00:16:35.12,00:16:35.12,>> So we'll talk to her.They're filling her head with
259,00:16:37.50,00:16:37.50,"stuff.She's the swing vote, I guess."
260,00:16:40.71,00:16:40.71,And why would she swing over tothem unless she thinks that she
261,00:16:44.33,00:16:44.33,should be the queen bee overthere?
262,00:16:46.50,00:16:46.50,">> Yeah, but she's not.She won't be."
263,00:16:48.17,00:16:48.17,">> Well, exactly.>> I hope she doesn't fall for"
264,00:16:52.04,00:16:52.04,their garbage.>> What's it say?
265,00:17:01.08,00:17:01.08,">> It says-- okay, listen good--""Continue your quest by crossing"
266,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,"the ocean."">> I'm here on Exile Island"
267,00:17:07.42,00:17:07.42,"again.Right away, Ami wanted to go to"
268,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,the other island.After having been to that island
269,00:17:12.88,00:17:12.88,"many times with Cirie, I'mlike... because Cirie and I"
270,00:17:15.88,00:17:15.88,"found all four clues.>> It says, ""Cross the ocean."""
271,00:17:19.83,00:17:19.83,So that's what we've donebefore.
272,00:17:22.12,00:17:22.12,">> Yeah.Ami saw the clue up in the tree,"
273,00:17:24.92,00:17:24.92,"and she could not figure it out,but I had to play dumb, you"
274,00:17:28.58,00:17:28.58,"know, like, ""I don't know.""I was just exhausted, and I"
275,00:17:31.21,00:17:31.21,wasn't about to go islandhopping again.
276,00:17:36.96,00:17:36.96,">> I think we should, becausethe tide's coming in, not out."
277,00:17:40.08,00:17:40.08,>> The waves started gettingchoppy.
278,00:17:42.42,00:17:42.42,"I said to Ami, ""Uh-oh.""I'm no weatherman, but the"
279,00:17:44.83,00:17:44.83,"clouds, everything, it lookedlike a big storm was coming in."
280,00:17:48.00,00:17:48.00,So pretty much clue searchinghad to come to an end.
281,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,">> Oh, my God!>> Oh, mother of God."
282,00:18:07.88,00:18:07.88,>> This is insane.>> It's pouring down rain.
283,00:18:13.88,00:18:13.88,Our shelter sucks.Everyone's freezing.
284,00:18:16.96,00:18:16.96,Everyone's cold.Everyone's sopping wet.
285,00:18:19.88,00:18:19.88,"Not much you can do.>> Oh, wow, it sucks in here."
286,00:18:25.12,00:18:25.12,>> It sprinkled last night.Tonight it's a monsoon.
287,00:18:29.21,00:18:29.21,"Oh, right on my face!>> Yay, victory!"
288,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17,">> Oh, yeah!>> Came up to the cave and"
289,00:18:45.46,00:18:45.46,"settled down for a nice sleep.The rain is falling really,"
290,00:18:49.58,00:18:49.58,"really, really, really hard, thehardest since we've been here."
291,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,">> We're totally covered.Oh, my God, this is so great."
292,00:18:56.21,00:18:56.21,>> This is amazing.>> Oh!
293,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,>> And I kind of feel bad forthe whole Airai tribe.
294,00:19:03.33,00:19:03.33,I know that they are probablynot doing well right now.
295,00:19:20.25,00:19:20.25,">> I'm sure the other tribe isdoing really well, staying dry"
296,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,and probably laughing about usright now having to endure this
297,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,wicked storm.I just hope no spiders get me--
298,00:19:33.54,00:19:33.54,or scorpions or rats.>> Last night was probably the
299,00:19:59.50,00:19:59.50,worst night that we've had sincewe've been here.
300,00:20:03.21,00:20:03.21,"It rained all night, and theshelter didn't do one single bit"
301,00:20:07.71,00:20:07.71,"of good.>> Oh, God!"
302,00:20:15.00,00:20:15.00,">> This morning, we feel like wegot beat up twice yesterday--"
303,00:20:18.38,00:20:18.38,once by the other tribe and onceby nature.

443,00:29:06.42,00:29:06.42,around her finger.It's that simple.

507,00:31:44.38,00:31:44.38,"dangerous.You know, Eliza's not a threat."

536,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,">> Eliza, please?Please, please."
537,00:33:05.46,00:33:05.46,">> Come on, Cirie.>> Why is it so..."
538,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,>> Because we need the strengthright now.

545,00:33:20.83,00:33:20.83,>> My vote has never changed.Your votes changed.
546,00:33:24.96,00:33:24.96,>> Cirie is killing me.You can't be the boss of

548,00:33:29.75,00:33:29.75,her go.She went from the swing vote to
549,00:33:31.88,00:33:31.88,the one who's deciding what'sgoing on for the whole group.
550,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,That can't happen.This feels like I'm in China

645,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,to vote their conscience.Then we have some common ground
646,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,"that we can work from.Otherwise, it's going to be, I"
647,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,"think, a much bigger split andkind of disastrous."
648,00:38:08.79,00:38:08.79,So I'm hoping that people dovote the way they honestly
649,00:38:11.71,00:38:11.71,believe this tribe is going tobe the strongest.
