28,00:01:07.67,00:01:07.67,up. Mary's going home.
29,00:01:09.58,00:01:09.58,Mikey will be completely confused as to what happened.

38,00:01:45.17,00:01:45.17,"you know, as long as the move is not you to take that whole crew."
39,00:01:50.42,00:01:50.42,"That would be you with four girls and a kid, you know?"
40,00:01:54.42,00:01:54.42,>> Yeah. >> And Chet is included as a
41,00:01:56.46,00:01:56.46,girl. Joel is playing a long game
42,00:01:59.62,00:01:59.62,right now when he should be focusing on a short game.
43,00:02:03.00,00:02:03.00,"When it gets down to the merge, you get rid of the strong ones."

47,00:02:16.08,00:02:16.08,challenges. They're all useless.
48,00:02:19.00,00:02:19.00,"I know it's a million bucks, but you're not going to win with"
49,00:02:20.83,00:02:20.83,"them. I mean, you're not doing it."

52,00:02:31.00,00:02:31.00,whole tribe in his pocket. >> I consider it that you made a
53,00:02:34.17,00:02:34.17,"move that you didn't have to make, okay, necessarily."
54,00:02:37.54,00:02:37.54,"And you know, if you want to make up for it, you can."
55,00:02:40.00,00:02:40.00,">> And I would really, really like to see the look on his face"
56,00:02:42.71,00:02:42.71,when the baseball bat comes swinging up beside him and wakes
57,00:02:45.12,00:02:45.12,him up to the reality that he doesn't have this tribe in his

64,00:04:14.50,00:04:14.50,just... >> They go to bed early.
65,00:04:17.04,00:04:17.04,">> Just tired of that damn cave. >> Amanda, Ozzy, James, and"
66,00:04:21.42,00:04:21.42,"Parvati said they were going to go down to the beach, and they"

68,00:04:25.21,00:04:25.21,"So I went down there with them, and they were working me."
69,00:04:35.75,00:04:35.75,>> Right. >> You dislike Jonathan that
70,00:04:43.79,00:04:43.79,"much, huh? >> They were like, ""You know, I"
71,00:04:52.92,00:04:52.92,"think we need to keep this team strong, and I think the two"
72,00:04:55.08,00:04:55.08,weakest people are Yau-Man and Cirie.
73,00:04:56.62,00:04:56.62,"I think we need to get them out of here."""
74,00:04:58.38,00:04:58.38,"And I kind of was like, ""Oh, yeah, sure, okay."""
75,00:05:00.96,00:05:00.96,"I listened to them, but I don't trust them."
76,00:05:06.50,00:05:06.50,They'd be stupid to stick with us knowing that the five of us
77,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,are so tight. >> So what's the proposal?
78,00:05:16.75,00:05:16.75,>> They've been working. They've been trying.
79,00:05:20.21,00:05:20.21,>> Unless they think that they have a chance with Cirie.
80,00:05:23.62,00:05:23.62,">> Well, there's definitely a little bit of juggling the two"
81,00:05:26.50,00:05:26.50,"foursomes, because they need my vote, either side."
82,00:05:30.42,00:05:30.42,And I'm still trying to figure out which side is better for me.
83,00:05:35.38,00:05:35.38,">> If we get another vote, then Parvati's going to go, right?"
84,00:05:38.29,00:05:38.29,>> For sure. >> She's weak enough and... and
85,00:05:42.96,00:05:42.96,threatening enough because of her relationships with Ozzy and
86,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,with James. >> And with Amanda.
87,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,"I mean, the two of them have been bonding."
88,00:05:49.21,00:05:49.21,">> As long as the five of us stay strong, and we are, then"
89,00:05:51.58,00:05:51.58,"we're cool. >> In this game, for me, it's"
90,00:05:54.58,00:05:54.58,all about who I think I can trust.
91,00:05:57.54,00:05:57.54,"And if I feel that I can trust you, then I'm willing to go all"
92,00:06:00.67,00:06:00.67,"the way with you. But if I don't trust you, then"
93,00:06:03.33,00:06:03.33,you can't believe a word I tell you.
94,00:06:16.92,00:06:16.92,>> Tree mail! >> Tree mail!
95,00:06:19.33,00:06:19.33,">> Uh-oh! >> This is a big tree mail, you"
96,00:06:21.25,00:06:21.25,guys. >> Big tree mail.

108,00:06:50.50,00:06:50.50,>> Three. >> We get to pick three?
109,00:06:52.38,00:06:52.38,">> Oh, God! >> We get three things, guys."
110,00:06:56.12,00:06:56.12,>> Right. >> That's awesome.
111,00:06:57.29,00:06:57.29,>> All right! >> Ready?
112,00:06:59.25,00:06:59.25,Shelter-- tarp and rope. >> Tarp and rope would be good.

193,00:12:06.25,00:12:06.25,Favorites now have four bags. They need just one more.
194,00:12:09.79,00:12:09.79,Favorites have their hands on that fifth and final bag.
195,00:12:13.38,00:12:13.38,Penner fighting for it! Penner's got it!
196,00:12:17.92,00:12:17.92,This will do it! Favorites win reward!
197,00:12:25.58,00:12:25.58,"A huge battle comes to an end. >> Oh, my God!"
198,00:12:33.29,00:12:33.29,>> PROBST: Nice work. Now you must choose one member
199,00:12:35.75,00:12:35.75,from the fans tribe to go to Exile Island.
200,00:12:38.50,00:12:38.50,Who are you going to send to Exile?
201,00:12:40.12,00:12:40.12,">> We're going to send KB. >> PROBST: Kathy, you don't look"
202,00:12:42.75,00:12:42.75,pleased at all with that news. >> No.
203,00:12:45.46,00:12:45.46,>> PROBST: Now who are you going to send from your own tribe?
204,00:12:47.92,00:12:47.92,"Ami, you're excited to go to Exile?"
205,00:12:49.88,00:12:49.88,">> I am-- second clue. >> PROBST: All right, Kathy and"
206,00:12:52.08,00:12:52.08,Ami head out. Boat's waiting for you.
207,00:12:54.83,00:12:54.83,You will rejoin your tribe at the next immunity challenge.
208,00:12:58.58,00:12:58.58,"All right, fans, got nothing for you."
209,00:13:01.46,00:13:01.46,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
210,00:13:05.04,00:13:05.04,">> Good job, guys. >> Good job, guys."
211,00:13:07.21,00:13:07.21,"Hell of a battle. >> PROBST: Favorites,"
212,00:13:08.83,00:13:08.83,"congratulations. You have shelter, a lighting"
213,00:13:10.92,00:13:10.92,"kit, and a survival kit. Come get your stuff, head back"
214,00:13:13.42,00:13:13.42,"to camp. >> The nice girl, we got tangled"
215,00:13:32.04,00:13:32.04,"up, and she's like, ""So do you have a girlfriend?"""
216,00:13:34.71,00:13:34.71,">> Well, Mike had both me and Amanda."
217,00:13:37.88,00:13:37.88,"He had two of us, like, wrapped up, and we were both struggling"
218,00:13:41.21,00:13:41.21,"to get free, and he's like, ""I'd like to stay like this all day."""
219,00:13:44.58,00:13:44.58,>> Holy crap. That was like the hardest thing
220,00:13:48.08,00:13:48.08,I've ever done. >> I don't know if the other
221,00:14:01.92,00:14:01.92,"people feel relaxed because they feel secure in their alliances,"
222,00:14:06.79,00:14:06.79,but I don't feel relaxed at all. I feel like I have to
223,00:14:11.29,00:14:11.29,continuously scramble to make sure everything works in my
224,00:14:14.58,00:14:14.58,"favor. >> You were just terminating,"
225,00:14:26.75,00:14:26.75,"like, throwing people left and right."
226,00:14:30.04,00:14:30.04,I was very impressed. >> Because I am in the middle
227,00:14:35.46,00:14:35.46,"right now, I have to look at every option or every scenario"
228,00:14:39.46,00:14:39.46,that could possibly happen and try to have a plan B.
229,00:14:45.58,00:14:45.58,"If I was in their position, I think they could do a little"
230,00:14:50.04,00:14:50.04,"more for me, actually. No one's washing my clothes."
231,00:14:54.75,00:14:54.75,I haven't gotten any special meals.
232,00:14:57.54,00:14:57.54,"I think if they really wanted my vote, they should probably do a"
233,00:15:00.38,00:15:00.38,"little more. I should probably be carried,"
234,00:15:02.54,00:15:02.54,"like, on a chariot-type thing. All right, ladies, I'm just"
235,00:15:22.08,00:15:22.08,"feeling a little bit nervous, and it's only because of the"
236,00:15:25.71,00:15:25.71,"relationships that you already have with James and you, Amanda,"
237,00:15:29.58,00:15:29.58,"have with Ozzy. But, Parvati, this James thing"
238,00:15:33.17,00:15:33.17,just kind of developed. >> Right.
239,00:15:44.12,00:15:44.12,>> That's the thing... >> I know.
240,00:15:49.25,00:15:49.25,>> I'm just going to put it out there.
241,00:15:50.54,00:15:50.54,I like flirting with Ozzy. So if that makes you
242,00:15:52.29,00:15:52.29,"uncomfortable, then I'll, like, stop, but..."
243,00:15:54.25,00:15:54.25,">> No, no, no, no, don't change. >> No, because that's the way"
244,00:15:56.04,00:15:56.04,"you keep him close, you know? And he doesn't asks questions."
245,00:15:59.00,00:15:59.00,James asks me no questions. >> Are you nervous about her?
246,00:16:04.21,00:16:04.21,">> No, I'm not. >> She's like me a little."
247,00:16:08.00,00:16:08.00,She gets paranoid. She needs to be reassured a lot.
248,00:16:11.00,00:16:11.00,>> Let's reassure her. >> Okay.
249,00:16:13.12,00:16:13.12,But they're out there filling her head with lies.
250,00:16:15.38,00:16:15.38,>> I want to vote Yau. >> You want to vote Yau?
251,00:16:17.83,00:16:17.83,>> Because if Yau goes to Exile Island one time...
252,00:16:20.08,00:16:20.08,">> Oh, yeah. >> Going up against Yau..."
253,00:16:21.42,00:16:21.42,>> You'll never win. >> Yeah.
254,00:16:23.08,00:16:23.08,>> So I have both of you guys' word that it's us three to the
255,00:16:26.17,00:16:26.17,end. >> Yes.
256,00:16:27.46,00:16:27.46,>> Yeah. >> I don't care if James
257,00:16:29.00,00:16:29.00,proposes to you or you and Ozzy have little Ozzlets.
258,00:16:31.88,00:16:31.88,">> Oh, you know how I am. >> All right."
259,00:16:35.12,00:16:35.12,>> So we'll talk to her. They're filling her head with
260,00:16:37.50,00:16:37.50,"stuff. She's the swing vote, I guess."
261,00:16:40.71,00:16:40.71,And why would she swing over to them unless she thinks that she
262,00:16:44.33,00:16:44.33,should be the queen bee over there?
263,00:16:46.50,00:16:46.50,">> Yeah, but she's not. She won't be."
264,00:16:48.17,00:16:48.17,">> Well, exactly. >> I hope she doesn't fall for"
265,00:16:52.04,00:16:52.04,their garbage. >> What's it say?
266,00:17:01.08,00:17:01.08,">> It says-- okay, listen good-- ""Continue your quest by crossing"
267,00:17:05.21,00:17:05.21,"the ocean."" >> I'm here on Exile Island"
268,00:17:07.42,00:17:07.42,"again. Right away, Ami wanted to go to"
269,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,the other island. After having been to that island
270,00:17:12.88,00:17:12.88,"many times with Cirie, I'm like... because Cirie and I"
271,00:17:15.88,00:17:15.88,"found all four clues. >> It says, ""Cross the ocean."""
272,00:17:19.83,00:17:19.83,So that's what we've done before.
273,00:17:22.12,00:17:22.12,">> Yeah. Ami saw the clue up in the tree,"
274,00:17:24.92,00:17:24.92,"and she could not figure it out, but I had to play dumb, you"
275,00:17:28.58,00:17:28.58,"know, like, ""I don't know."" I was just exhausted, and I"
276,00:17:31.21,00:17:31.21,wasn't about to go island hopping again.
277,00:17:36.96,00:17:36.96,">> I think we should, because the tide's coming in, not out."
278,00:17:40.08,00:17:40.08,>> The waves started getting choppy.
279,00:17:42.42,00:17:42.42,"I said to Ami, ""Uh-oh."" I'm no weatherman, but the"
280,00:17:44.83,00:17:44.83,"clouds, everything, it looked like a big storm was coming in."
281,00:17:48.00,00:17:48.00,So pretty much clue searching had to come to an end.
282,00:18:02.17,00:18:02.17,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, mother of God."
283,00:18:07.88,00:18:07.88,>> This is insane. >> It's pouring down rain.
284,00:18:13.88,00:18:13.88,Our shelter sucks. Everyone's freezing.
285,00:18:16.96,00:18:16.96,Everyone's cold. Everyone's sopping wet.
286,00:18:19.88,00:18:19.88,"Not much you can do. >> Oh, wow, it sucks in here."
287,00:18:25.12,00:18:25.12,>> It sprinkled last night. Tonight it's a monsoon.
288,00:18:29.21,00:18:29.21,"Oh, right on my face! >> Yay, victory!"
289,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17,">> Oh, yeah! >> Came up to the cave and"
290,00:18:45.46,00:18:45.46,"settled down for a nice sleep. The rain is falling really,"
291,00:18:49.58,00:18:49.58,"really, really, really hard, the hardest since we've been here."
292,00:18:53.17,00:18:53.17,">> We're totally covered. Oh, my God, this is so great."
293,00:18:56.21,00:18:56.21,>> This is amazing. >> Oh!
294,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,>> And I kind of feel bad for the whole Airai tribe.
295,00:19:03.33,00:19:03.33,I know that they are probably not doing well right now.
296,00:19:20.25,00:19:20.25,">> I'm sure the other tribe is doing really well, staying dry"
297,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,and probably laughing about us right now having to endure this
298,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,wicked storm. I just hope no spiders get me--
299,00:19:33.54,00:19:33.54,or scorpions or rats. >> Last night was probably the
300,00:19:59.50,00:19:59.50,worst night that we've had since we've been here.
301,00:20:03.21,00:20:03.21,"It rained all night, and the shelter didn't do one single bit"
302,00:20:07.71,00:20:07.71,"of good. >> Oh, God!"
303,00:20:15.00,00:20:15.00,">> This morning, we feel like we got beat up twice yesterday--"
304,00:20:18.38,00:20:18.38,once by the other tribe and once by nature.
305,00:20:27.38,00:20:27.38,">> Glorious evening, huh? >> I didn't sleep at all."
306,00:20:36.67,00:20:36.67,Did y'all? >> No.
307,00:20:38.25,00:20:38.25,>> No. >> My fingers are prune-y from
308,00:20:42.21,00:20:42.21,"it being so wet. >> Oh, I know."
309,00:20:46.67,00:20:46.67,>> I bet the water is warmer. How did you sleep on the boat?
310,00:20:52.00,00:20:52.00,>> Huh? >> How did you sleep on the
311,00:20:53.46,00:20:53.46,"boat? >> Oh, fine."
312,00:20:55.79,00:20:55.79,">> Not the sort of night you want to have before a challenge,"
313,00:20:58.25,00:20:58.25,and this one's for immunity. I think that people are pretty
314,00:21:01.67,00:21:01.67,demoralized right now. We cannot lose today.
315,00:21:11.08,00:21:11.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! We'll now bring in Ami and"
316,00:21:23.38,00:21:23.38,"Kathy, returning from Exile Island."
317,00:21:28.21,00:21:28.21,( applause ) >> We had to just sleep in the
318,00:21:33.12,00:21:33.12,rain. >> Love you guys.
319,00:21:37.21,00:21:37.21,>> PROBST: Ready to get to it? >> Yeah.
320,00:21:39.50,00:21:39.50,>> PROBST: First things first. I know you're hiding that idol
321,00:21:41.75,00:21:41.75,"back there, Amanda. >> I know."
322,00:21:43.21,00:21:43.21,I'm trying to keep it from you. We'll get it back.
323,00:21:48.04,00:21:48.04,">> PROBST: Once again, immunity is back up for grabs."
324,00:21:52.04,00:21:52.04,"For today's challenge, each tribe will choose two men and"
325,00:21:54.62,00:21:54.62,two women. Their job will be to hold to a
326,00:21:57.04,00:21:57.04,very heavy rope net while members of the other tribe
327,00:22:00.62,00:22:00.62,attempt to shoot coconuts into the net.
328,00:22:04.58,00:22:04.58,"The more coconuts you get into the other tribe's net, the"
329,00:22:07.12,00:22:07.12,heavier that net will become. The tribe that holds on the
330,00:22:11.00,00:22:11.00,"longest wins immunity, guaranteed at least one more"
331,00:22:14.75,00:22:14.75,night in this game. Losers go to tribal council.
332,00:22:17.33,00:22:17.33,Somebody will be voted out. Give you a minute to strategize.
333,00:22:21.42,00:22:21.42,We'll get started. Here we go.
334,00:22:27.04,00:22:27.04,"Holding the net for the fans: Erik, Natalie, Tracy, and Joel."
335,00:22:31.79,00:22:31.79,"For the favorites: Parvati, James, Jonathan Penner, and"
336,00:22:34.83,00:22:34.83,Cirie. Survivors ready?
337,00:22:38.79,00:22:38.79,"Go. >> Come on, Ozzy."
338,00:22:41.62,00:22:41.62,>> PROBST: Ozzy and Mikey B. up first.
339,00:22:44.79,00:22:44.79,Learning curve. You want to get as many coconuts
340,00:22:48.17,00:22:48.17,in the other tribe's net as you can.
341,00:22:52.58,00:22:52.58,Jason connects for the fans. >> Good job.
342,00:22:55.08,00:22:55.08,">> PROBST: The more coconuts, the heavier that net will"
343,00:22:56.79,00:22:56.79,"become. >> God, that's heavy."
344,00:23:00.67,00:23:00.67,>> PROBST: A little harder to throw a coconut than you'd
345,00:23:03.08,00:23:03.08,think. Alexis connects for the fans.
346,00:23:07.46,00:23:07.46,"Eliza just misses. >> Come on, Amanda!"
347,00:23:12.79,00:23:12.79,">> You almost got it! >> That wasn't correct, Amanda."
348,00:23:16.08,00:23:16.08,>> PROBST: Jason showing them how it's done.
349,00:23:19.71,00:23:19.71,Yau-Man finally breaks the spell.
350,00:23:22.29,00:23:22.29,Favorites are on the board. Kathy just misses for the fans.
351,00:23:27.08,00:23:27.08,Ami gets one in. Now the favorites are on a roll.
352,00:23:32.54,00:23:32.54,"Alexis drills another one. >> Yeah, you're good, little"
353,00:23:34.29,00:23:34.29,one. >> PROBST: Eliza goes underhand.
354,00:23:36.21,00:23:36.21,">> Yeah, Eliza! >> PROBST: Chet!"

357,00:23:48.21,00:23:48.21,"Come on, Kathy, show us how it's done in Wisconsin."
358,00:23:53.25,00:23:53.25,"Chet, we're at a pageant and... Chet!"
359,00:23:58.29,00:23:58.29,>> PROBST: Penner talking a lot of trash-- just what we expect.
360,00:24:03.04,00:24:03.04,">> Nice shot there, squirrely boy."
361,00:24:04.79,00:24:04.79,>> PROBST: Reminds me of the Cook Islands.
362,00:24:17.25,00:24:17.25,Nets starting to get heavier now.
363,00:24:20.46,00:24:20.46,"How's it going, James? >> I'm chillin'."
364,00:24:22.46,00:24:22.46,>> PROBST: Yeah. >> Always.

374,00:24:51.92,00:24:51.92,Starting to take its toll now. >> Yeah!

402,00:26:50.79,00:26:50.79,I'm sorry. It's a dumb play on her part.
403,00:26:54.04,00:26:54.04,Do you agree? >> All right.
404,00:26:56.21,00:26:56.21,">> And we're cool, right, you and me?"
405,00:26:57.75,00:26:57.75,>> We're cool. >> I think we should just stick

407,00:27:01.33,00:27:01.33,"stick with the plan. >> Cirie wants Yau-Man gone,"

418,00:27:45.46,00:27:45.46,"Man, the chances of having a good run at an immunity"
419,00:27:49.25,00:27:49.25,challenge are better. Eliza is not good at challenges.
420,00:27:52.92,00:27:52.92,">> He's out for himself. >> I swear, we can vote Eliza"
421,00:27:55.08,00:27:55.08,next. >> And he'll sneak by.

423,00:27:59.67,00:27:59.67,"find another idol and not be able to go, and I thought we"
424,00:28:02.58,00:28:02.58,were all cool on that. >> What do you think?
425,00:28:05.83,00:28:05.83,">> Yeah, I mean, if you guys really feel that way."
426,00:28:09.04,00:28:09.04,>> I feel. >> Which one?
427,00:28:11.25,00:28:11.25,">> Yau. >> Or Jonathan, either one."

429,00:28:18.79,00:28:18.79,>> I didn't mean to break up the party.
430,00:28:20.54,00:28:20.54,">> Oh, you didn't. >> You all right?"
431,00:28:25.00,00:28:25.00,">> Okay, we're going to do some girl stuff."
432,00:28:34.04,00:28:34.04,">> Me or Yau? So who's she voting for, me or"
433,00:28:37.12,00:28:37.12,Yau? >> I don't know.
434,00:28:39.29,00:28:39.29,">> Just tell me, is it me or is it Yau?"
435,00:28:41.50,00:28:41.50,>> I don't know. They're trying to decide.
436,00:28:43.12,00:28:43.12,That's what they were talking about when you walked up.
437,00:28:45.58,00:28:45.58,">> I'm starting to feel a little antsy about the vote, only"
438,00:28:47.58,00:28:47.58,"because I'd like to believe that Cirie is tight with us, but"
439,00:28:51.08,00:28:51.08,obviously Amanda and Parvati have been pouring a lot of BS
440,00:28:53.83,00:28:53.83,"into her ear, and you know, you have to hope that Cirie is, I"
441,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,"don't know, smart enough, loyal enough, happy enough to stick"
442,00:29:00.92,00:29:00.92,with our group. It's going to be the five of us
443,00:29:03.42,00:29:03.42,to vote off Parvati because she's got these two guys wrapped
444,00:29:06.42,00:29:06.42,around her finger. It's that simple.
445,00:29:10.96,00:29:10.96,"Now, I don't know what they've said to you about our"
446,00:29:13.79,00:29:13.79,trustworthiness or our desire to vote you out.
447,00:29:16.08,00:29:16.08,"I don't know what they've said, okay?"
448,00:29:17.54,00:29:17.54,>> Uh-huh. >> It's not true.
449,00:29:19.38,00:29:19.38,"Please, because we've been a solid five."
450,00:29:23.75,00:29:23.75,The plan is a good one. It's simply not true.
451,00:29:26.29,00:29:26.29,>> Those two pairs together-- right?-- forms a core four.
452,00:29:29.71,00:29:29.71,">> You know, I hear that. >> There's no way you could work"
453,00:29:31.71,00:29:31.71,"yourself into it. I mean, as soon as they've got"
454,00:29:33.54,00:29:33.54,"the vote, they're going to take you out."
455,00:29:35.04,00:29:35.04,">> But you know what, Yau? The same argument that you're"
456,00:29:36.79,00:29:36.79,"using, they use the same argument."
457,00:29:39.25,00:29:39.25,So why should I believe this one over that one?
458,00:29:41.46,00:29:41.46,>> I'm not going to use an argument.
459,00:29:43.17,00:29:43.17,I'm going to use common sense. >> Uh-huh.
460,00:29:44.75,00:29:44.75,">> Honestly, the five of us should march forward together."
461,00:29:48.62,00:29:48.62,There's no reason not to. We have... I have no hidden
462,00:29:50.96,00:29:50.96,agenda. I have no interest in voting any
463,00:29:53.08,00:29:53.08,of the four of you out. That's the god's honest truth.
464,00:29:55.96,00:29:55.96,">> I know that you and Yau have y'all little thing, and if you"
465,00:29:59.08,00:29:59.08,want to stand here and say that y'all don't...
466,00:30:00.88,00:30:00.88,>> But there's only the two of us.
467,00:30:02.08,00:30:02.08,">> Cirie, Cirie... >> Okay."
468,00:30:03.88,00:30:03.88,">> Hold on, hold on, hold on. >> That's my thing."
469,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,That's my thing. >> I appreciate that.
470,00:30:06.67,00:30:06.67,I appreciate that. >> Keep it real.
471,00:30:08.21,00:30:08.21,>> Let's keep it real. >> Yeah.
472,00:30:09.42,00:30:09.42,">> I think that you and I have a little thing, okay?"
473,00:30:11.62,00:30:11.62,I think that Ami and I have a little thing.
474,00:30:13.79,00:30:13.79,It's ridiculous! >> Call it what you want.
475,00:30:16.08,00:30:16.08,>> I'm going to. I'm going to.
476,00:30:17.62,00:30:17.62,">> And being like that is not really going to get my vote,"
477,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,"seriously. >> Listen, wait a second."
478,00:30:21.08,00:30:21.08,We have a long way to go. It's day...
479,00:30:23.50,00:30:23.50,>> I know. I played.
480,00:30:25.12,00:30:25.12,"Just like you played, I played too."
481,00:30:27.08,00:30:27.08,"How far did you go? >> I don't know, maybe not as"
482,00:30:29.12,00:30:29.12,far as you. >> I've seen everybody.
483,00:30:31.08,00:30:31.08,"I may look like I'm laughing and joking and playing, but I'm"
484,00:30:33.33,00:30:33.33,"watching everybody, and I know that what you have... I know"
485,00:30:36.67,00:30:36.67,there's no way you would vote him out before me.
486,00:30:39.17,00:30:39.17,I know it ain't. >> I don't... you know what?
487,00:30:42.12,00:30:42.12,"I thought we were solid. And they've come up, and they've"
488,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,said stuff to you that has put doubt into your mind.
489,00:30:47.12,00:30:47.12,But I have not done anything to you to put that doubt into your
490,00:30:49.04,00:30:49.04,mind. >> I just...
491,00:30:52.12,00:30:52.12,">> I'm trying... you know, you want to keep it real."
492,00:30:55.58,00:30:55.58,"I'm trying to keep it real. >> I have, I have."
493,00:30:57.92,00:30:57.92,This is why we're having this conversation.
494,00:30:59.38,00:30:59.38,">> Well, I am keeping it real. We're having a conversation."
495,00:31:08.75,00:31:08.75,">> I'm going to change, and I'm going to think, and I just need,"
496,00:31:11.04,00:31:11.04,"like, five minutes without all the stuff."
497,00:31:15.33,00:31:15.33,"( Cirie sighing ) >> I mean, let's take Yau-Man"
498,00:31:20.12,00:31:20.12,"out tonight if that's the way it's got to be, but Parvati..."
499,00:31:22.71,00:31:22.71,>> I don't think that's a good idea.
500,00:31:24.21,00:31:24.21,>> I don't think so either. So who's it going to be?
501,00:31:25.79,00:31:25.79,>> I think Eliza is the obvious choice.
502,00:31:27.50,00:31:27.50,>> All right. >> If you guys were to vote for
503,00:31:30.00,00:31:30.00,"Parvati, it's going to be throwing votes away, and it will"
504,00:31:32.33,00:31:32.33,"be Yau-Man who goes home, because they will have numbers."
505,00:31:35.21,00:31:35.21,">> You know, I hear what you're saying about your relationship"
506,00:31:37.38,00:31:37.38,"with her, you know, but I'm talking about the fact that"
507,00:31:41.58,00:31:41.58,"she's got you in her corner, and she's got James, and it's"
508,00:31:44.38,00:31:44.38,"dangerous. You know, Eliza's not a threat."
509,00:31:47.00,00:31:47.00,"I mean, you're right, she's the weakest link, but she's also the"
510,00:31:49.33,00:31:49.33,least threatening link. You know what I mean?
511,00:31:51.83,00:31:51.83,"I mean, that's just the way I've been think about it, but I can"
512,00:31:53.96,00:31:53.96,"rethink it, I guess. >> Cirie is not going to change"
513,00:31:57.04,00:31:57.04,her vote. She's voting for Yau.
514,00:32:00.25,00:32:00.25,>> That's fine. >> We have to vote with her.
515,00:32:04.08,00:32:04.08,>> I'm not... I'm voting for Eliza.
516,00:32:07.08,00:32:07.08,I have to. I think that's the right thing
517,00:32:08.79,00:32:08.79,to do. I think that to keep us strong
518,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,is to vote out Eliza. >> But Cirie's not budging on
519,00:32:15.08,00:32:15.08,Yau. She's voting Yau-Man.
520,00:32:17.75,00:32:17.75,If we don't... >> We don't need Cirie.
521,00:32:19.92,00:32:19.92,>> If we don't vote with her... >> Then what?
522,00:32:22.04,00:32:22.04,>> ...she's not going to... she'll never trust us.
523,00:32:24.12,00:32:24.12,">> Who's she going to trust, someone other than the five of"
524,00:32:26.83,00:32:26.83,us? >> I just don't think it's a
525,00:32:31.21,00:32:31.21,good thing if we vote different people.
526,00:32:33.67,00:32:33.67,I just think we all need to vote the same person.
527,00:32:36.17,00:32:36.17,">> I don't think it's good, too, that she's, like, setting this"
528,00:32:37.96,00:32:37.96,"decision. Like, what's up with that?"
529,00:32:40.04,00:32:40.04,>> I don't think that's right. >> Next time it's going to be
530,00:32:41.83,00:32:41.83,"all her decision, too? >> No."
531,00:32:43.25,00:32:43.25,">> You see what I'm saying, though?"
532,00:32:44.50,00:32:44.50,"Like, I didn't like that. >> I agree."
533,00:32:47.29,00:32:47.29,Let's talk to her right now. >> Who?
534,00:32:50.25,00:32:50.25,>> Cirie. >> What?
535,00:32:55.25,00:32:55.25,>> All five of us need to talk. >> The more that I think about
536,00:32:58.88,00:32:58.88,"it, the more it seems like it makes more sense to vote Eliza."
537,00:33:02.71,00:33:02.71,">> Eliza, please? Please, please."
538,00:33:05.46,00:33:05.46,">> Come on, Cirie. >> Why is it so..."
539,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,>> Because we need the strength right now.
540,00:33:09.17,00:33:09.17,>> For challenges. >> We're going to be on man
541,00:33:10.71,00:33:10.71,"short. >> It doesn't matter, but we all"
542,00:33:12.17,00:33:12.17,need to be on the same page as far as the five of us.
543,00:33:13.88,00:33:13.88,">> I really... honestly, I don't want to change my vote."
544,00:33:16.25,00:33:16.25,I don't feel threatened by Eliza at all.
545,00:33:19.25,00:33:19.25,">> That's not sticking together, though."
546,00:33:20.83,00:33:20.83,>> My vote has never changed. Your votes changed.
547,00:33:24.96,00:33:24.96,>> Cirie is killing me. You can't be the boss of
548,00:33:27.12,00:33:27.12,"everything, and everybody just let her go, let her go, and let"
549,00:33:29.75,00:33:29.75,her go. She went from the swing vote to
550,00:33:31.88,00:33:31.88,the one who's deciding what's going on for the whole group.
551,00:33:35.25,00:33:35.25,That can't happen. This feels like I'm in China
552,00:33:37.33,00:33:37.33,"again, messing with a bunch of dumbasses."
553,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,>> I'm not sure we can't still get Parvati out with four.
554,00:33:42.83,00:33:42.83,I'm not sure. Because they're split between...
555,00:33:45.83,00:33:45.83,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. >> Some folks want to vote for"
556,00:33:50.04,00:33:50.04,"Yau, and some folks want to vote for you."
557,00:33:54.58,00:33:54.58,Four votes for her may be enough.
558,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,>> They're not going to go into tribal split.
559,00:33:59.62,00:33:59.62,That's the dumbest thing ever. They're not that stupid.
560,00:34:02.71,00:34:02.71,>> They were kind of talking like they might.
561,00:34:04.88,00:34:04.88,">> Craziness, craziness before the vote."
562,00:34:07.08,00:34:07.08,"Well, the four of us, the remaining four of the five, not"
563,00:34:09.79,00:34:09.79,"including Cirie, are going to stay tight and vote for Parvati."
564,00:34:14.62,00:34:14.62,">> What's going on? >> Because right now, the other"
565,00:34:18.08,00:34:18.08,"group, including Cirie, are split."
566,00:34:20.75,00:34:20.75,Some of them want to vote Eliza out as the weakest link.
567,00:34:23.88,00:34:23.88,Some of them want to vote Yau- Man out as either the weakest
568,00:34:26.79,00:34:26.79,link or the biggest threat. I'm not sure why they would vote
569,00:34:29.00,00:34:29.00,"Yau-Man out. Come on, go be productive."
570,00:34:32.29,00:34:32.29,"You're being paranoid. If we can keep them split, if we"
571,00:34:35.54,00:34:35.54,"can keep them from coming to a consensus, our four votes would"
572,00:34:39.38,00:34:39.38,actually be enough to get Parvati out.
573,00:34:42.17,00:34:42.17,Our four votes may actually win the day.
574,00:34:44.88,00:34:44.88,"That's what I'm hoping for, fingers crossed."
575,00:35:05.12,00:35:05.12,">> PROBST: Penner, got to ask, how disappointing is it to be"
576,00:35:07.21,00:35:07.21,back here? >> It's terrible.
577,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,After that big victory yesterday that felt so great and so
578,00:35:12.88,00:35:12.88,"earned, today was a tough day after that loss."
579,00:35:16.21,00:35:16.21,">> PROBST: James, do the fans earn a bit of respect from you"
580,00:35:19.71,00:35:19.71,guys that they are here to play as well?
581,00:35:22.21,00:35:22.21,">> Yeah, they have definitely earned some respect."
582,00:35:24.42,00:35:24.42,They got a little more hunger in them.
583,00:35:26.75,00:35:26.75,"We're dry, and we have food, and I guess it's made us kind of"
584,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,soft. We do need to win and make sure
585,00:35:31.62,00:35:31.62,"that the favorites are on the top at the end, and they're"
586,00:35:34.21,00:35:34.21,"winning right now, and I don't like it."
587,00:35:36.62,00:35:36.62,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, have you isolated a problem why you're"
588,00:35:38.62,00:35:38.62,"losing? >> We need to really, really be"
589,00:35:41.79,00:35:41.79,"hungry for the win. Whenever we won anything, we"
590,00:35:44.71,00:35:44.71,"were all very happy for, you know, a day, and then once we"
591,00:35:47.83,00:35:47.83,"lost, happened to be the more critical ones, and I feel very"
592,00:35:50.96,00:35:50.96,"vulnerable every time we lose. >> PROBST: Penner, there's two"
593,00:35:54.00,00:35:54.00,ideas going on early in the game.
594,00:35:56.71,00:35:56.71,"Is this more about ""Let's all try to stay together,"" or is it"
595,00:35:59.17,00:35:59.17,"""I'm going to win this game, one way or another""?"
596,00:36:02.54,00:36:02.54,>> I think some of us would like to stay together and make this
597,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,tribe as strong as possible. And I think that some of us are
598,00:36:09.71,00:36:09.71,making moves already to eliminate people that they
599,00:36:12.96,00:36:12.96,consider threats to them and take control of the game.
600,00:36:17.25,00:36:17.25,">> PROBST: Cirie, where are you sitting on this?"
601,00:36:19.04,00:36:19.04,">> For me, Jeff, I'm looking at it as far as the tribe and as"
602,00:36:22.92,00:36:22.92,far as myself in this game. And if I'm not playing the game
603,00:36:26.92,00:36:26.92,"that's going to benefit you the most, it doesn't mean that I'm"
604,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,not doing what's best for the tribe.
605,00:36:33.04,00:36:33.04,">> PROBST: Penner, you had a lot of reactions during that"
606,00:36:35.12,00:36:35.12,"comment. >> I mean, she's made a move"
607,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,today that will advance her in the game and put her in a power
608,00:36:39.75,00:36:39.75,"position, and I don't think anybody believes that voting out"
609,00:36:43.00,00:36:43.00,the person that she wants to vote out is going to make the
610,00:36:45.17,00:36:45.17,"tribe stronger. >> For me, Jeff, had I made the"
611,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,"move that he wanted me to make, we wouldn't even be having this"
612,00:36:51.21,00:36:51.21,conversation. >> I thought you were in an
613,00:36:53.29,00:36:53.29,"alliance, and you flopped, and then you brought everybody over."
614,00:36:55.62,00:36:55.62,You did. >> Is this not the pot calling
615,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,the kettle black? Whatever.
616,00:36:59.62,00:36:59.62,>> I don't know. I thought I was in an alliance
617,00:37:01.21,00:37:01.21,"with you. Until today, I was."
618,00:37:03.04,00:37:03.04,">> Jonathan, I came into your alliance as the fifth person,"
619,00:37:06.25,00:37:06.25,and I'm supposed to trust you. >> Were you in the alliance?
620,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,Were you in the alliance? Did you say you were in the
621,00:37:09.96,00:37:09.96,alliance and working with us and that we were solid and all that?
622,00:37:11.88,00:37:11.88,"You did. >> I did, I did."
623,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,">> Okay, that's all I want to say."
624,00:37:14.75,00:37:14.75,">> I did, but I don't trust you, point blank, period."
625,00:37:17.38,00:37:17.38,>> And now you've asked everyone else to help you vote off the
626,00:37:19.50,00:37:19.50,person that is a threat... >> I didn't ask anybody
627,00:37:21.50,00:37:21.50,anything. >> Please.
628,00:37:22.88,00:37:22.88,>> We all came to a decision to vote who we vote... who we're
629,00:37:25.12,00:37:25.12,voting. >> Because you said you weren't
630,00:37:26.71,00:37:26.71,going to vote for anybody else. That's the only person you were
631,00:37:28.08,00:37:28.08,going to vote for. >> You told me the best thing
632,00:37:29.54,00:37:29.54,for this tribe was to get rid of Parvati.
633,00:37:31.21,00:37:31.21,">> I still believe that. >> And because I didn't do that,"
634,00:37:33.08,00:37:33.08,this is why we're having that conversation.
635,00:37:34.96,00:37:34.96,>> I'm only trying to make moves to make this tribe stronger.
636,00:37:36.83,00:37:36.83,>> I'm not doing what you want me to do.
637,00:37:38.58,00:37:38.58,I don't trust you as far as I can pick you up and throw you.
638,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,Sorry. And if you're upset that they
639,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,"trust me, too bad. >> I'm not upset."
640,00:37:46.29,00:37:46.29,I'm upset that you are going to now be in the driver's seat.
641,00:37:48.96,00:37:48.96,>> Because I'm not voting the way you want me to vote.
642,00:37:51.04,00:37:51.04,>> Anybody can vote any way they want.
643,00:37:52.92,00:37:52.92,>> They should. I don't have mind control over
644,00:37:54.71,00:37:54.71,anybody here. So y'all all vote however you
645,00:37:57.29,00:37:57.29,"want to vote. >> Right, I would urge everyone"
646,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,to vote their conscience. Then we have some common ground
647,00:38:02.17,00:38:02.17,"that we can work from. Otherwise, it's going to be, I"
648,00:38:05.12,00:38:05.12,"think, a much bigger split and kind of disastrous."
649,00:38:08.79,00:38:08.79,So I'm hoping that people do vote the way they honestly
650,00:38:11.71,00:38:11.71,believe this tribe is going to be the strongest.
651,00:38:13.71,00:38:13.71,>> Everybody here knows it was split.
652,00:38:15.58,00:38:15.58,">> Right. >> PROBST: Parvati, during this"
653,00:38:19.42,00:38:19.42,"whole thing, you had a look on your face like ""I just wish this"
654,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,"would go away."" >> Yeah."
655,00:38:24.00,00:38:24.00,"I mean, people are concerned that maybe I'm just flirting and"
656,00:38:28.04,00:38:28.04,"manipulating other people to, you know, make alliances and get"
657,00:38:31.42,00:38:31.42,"people on my side. So yeah, I know that my name has"
658,00:38:34.71,00:38:34.71,"been brought up. And that scares me, but that"
659,00:38:38.17,00:38:38.17,"doesn't surprise me at all. >> PROBST: Well, it sounds like"
660,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,"however it goes down, it's going to be a very big vote for this"
661,00:38:43.58,00:38:43.58,tribe. Let's get to it.
662,00:38:45.12,00:38:45.12,"It is time to vote. Amanda, you're up."
663,00:39:01.54,00:39:01.54,">> I have nothing against you, Parvati, but I think that by"
664,00:39:04.92,00:39:04.92,"following Cirie, you have signed your own death warrant."
665,00:39:07.79,00:39:07.79,She's led you like a sheep to the slaughter and played you
666,00:39:10.04,00:39:10.04,like a fiddle. I'm sorry for you.
667,00:39:33.92,00:39:33.92,>> You aligning with the biggest liar in the game made me feel
668,00:39:37.88,00:39:37.88,like strategically this was the best move for me.
669,00:39:40.46,00:39:40.46,Sorry. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
670,00:39:44.25,00:39:44.25,votes. If anybody has the hidden
671,00:39:56.33,00:39:56.33,"immunity idol, now is the time to play it."
672,00:40:02.17,00:40:02.17,"Once votes are read, the decision is final."
673,00:40:03.75,00:40:03.75,Person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area
674,00:40:05.96,00:40:05.96,immediately. I'll read the votes.
675,00:40:10.50,00:40:10.50,"First vote, Parvati. Yau-Man."
676,00:40:21.54,00:40:21.54,Yau-Man. That's two votes Yau-Man.
677,00:40:27.88,00:40:27.88,Parvati. Two votes Parvati.
678,00:40:29.62,00:40:29.62,Two votes Yau-Man. Cirie.
679,00:40:35.92,00:40:35.92,"Two votes Parvati, two votes Yau-Man, one vote Cirie."
680,00:40:42.50,00:40:42.50,"Yau-Man. That's three votes Yau-Man, two"
681,00:40:44.83,00:40:44.83,"votes Parvati, one vote Cirie. Yau-Man."
682,00:40:52.62,00:40:52.62,"That's four votes Yau-Man, two votes Parvati, one vote Cirie."
683,00:41:01.75,00:41:01.75,"Third person voted out of Fans vs. Favorites, Yau-Man."
684,00:41:05.04,00:41:05.04,That's five. That's enough.
685,00:41:06.50,00:41:06.50,You need to bring me your torch. >> Great playing with you.
686,00:41:10.62,00:41:10.62,Don't worry. Don't cry.
687,00:41:21.83,00:41:21.83,">> PROBST: Yau-Man, the tribe has spoken."
688,00:41:25.71,00:41:25.71,"Time for you to go. >> Good luck, you guys."
689,00:41:27.92,00:41:27.92,"Have fun. >> PROBST: Well, the problem"
690,00:41:40.67,00:41:40.67,with this tribe is no secret. You guys are divided.
691,00:41:44.12,00:41:44.12,Big question is what are you going to do about it?
692,00:41:47.12,00:41:47.12,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
