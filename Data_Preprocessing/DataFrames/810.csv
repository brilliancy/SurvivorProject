262,00:17:22.13,00:17:22.13,It kind of sucks.>> The new Mogo Mogo
263,00:17:40.73,00:17:40.73,"definitely got the short end ofthis stick, because we inherited"

295,00:19:27.77,00:19:27.77,living.Maybe that will knock 'em down
296,00:19:31.27,00:19:31.27,"even further, 'cause they suck.>> Oh, God."
297,00:19:42.67,00:19:42.67,>> Conditioner.>> There's the shampoo.

315,00:20:49.83,00:20:49.83,"...so much of the reason why shewas having such a good time, and"
316,00:20:53.33,00:20:53.33,"why I was having such a goodtime, was because of each other."
317,00:20:56.67,00:20:56.67,Here's to Amber.>> To Amber.
318,00:20:59.77,00:20:59.77,>> To Amber.>> Hope she makes it.

564,00:36:12.73,00:36:12.73,"like tonight are just, uh...miserable."
565,00:36:37.07,00:36:37.07,">> PROBST: Hello, guys.Let's talk about the past few"
566,00:36:39.63,00:36:39.63,"days.We brought both tribes together,"
567,00:36:42.20,00:36:42.20,"the idea being, we would shufflethe tribes."
568,00:36:44.90,00:36:44.90,The former Mogo Mogo stayedcompletely together.
569,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,The only thing that changed isyou gained a member.
570,00:36:51.10,00:36:51.10,Two big events really transpiredwhen this went down.
571,00:36:55.47,00:36:55.47,"First one was, you got a newhome."
572,00:36:57.90,00:36:57.90,Kathy?>> Oh! (scoffs)
573,00:36:59.97,00:36:59.97,"I mean, you know, it's afour-star hotel, you know?"
574,00:37:02.70,00:37:02.70,"We're coming from the 3-M Motelover on Mogo Mogo, so it's so"
575,00:37:05.87,00:37:05.87,"much better.And you know, I mean, I was"
576,00:37:07.97,00:37:07.97,embarrassed that we didn't go alittle further with our camp for
577,00:37:10.70,00:37:10.70,"those poor guys.But no, it's great!"
578,00:37:12.60,00:37:12.60,"I mean, we couldn't be happier.And can you see you get"
579,00:37:15.37,00:37:15.37,stronger.>> PROBST: The other big result
580,00:37:17.33,00:37:17.33,"of this tribe shuffle was oneperson shuffled, and that was"
581,00:37:20.57,00:37:20.57,"you, Amber.And the look on your face..."
582,00:37:22.93,00:37:22.93,">> Yeah, I was extremely upset.It was... it was impossible to"
583,00:37:26.33,00:37:26.33,"hide.And that first night, it was"
584,00:37:29.90,00:37:29.90,really hard.But I woke up the next morning
585,00:37:32.30,00:37:32.30,"and told myself, ""It's a newday, and so, I'm not going to"
586,00:37:34.53,00:37:34.53,"let myself get down.""I had one down night, and that"
587,00:37:36.50,00:37:36.50,"next morning I woke up, and Iwas a new tribe."
588,00:37:38.97,00:37:38.97,">> PROBST: So, just like that,the loyalty you had with Boston"
589,00:37:42.70,00:37:42.70,Rob and Big Tom and everybodyelse on your old tribe is gone?
590,00:37:46.47,00:37:46.47,>> I can't make any guesseswhat's going to happen in this
591,00:37:48.80,00:37:48.80,"game, so I have to play with mynew members, and these are my"

593,00:37:54.33,00:37:54.33,"be a little hard to trust that.Obviously, odd person out."
594,00:37:57.27,00:37:57.27,"So, when she says, ""Hey, I'mwith you guys,"" what's the part"
595,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,"of you going, ""Hmm, I don'tknow?"""
596,00:38:02.60,00:38:02.60,">> I mean, it would besilly to think her, you know, 20"

605,00:38:35.30,00:38:35.30,with different personalities andwith different goals.
606,00:38:39.17,00:38:39.17,">> PROBST: Lex, in a way, was itnice to get Amber?"
607,00:38:42.53,00:38:42.53,"Because really, your tribe couldstay intact, and you could get"
608,00:38:46.10,00:38:46.10,"rid of the opposition, afterhaving come to a Tribal Council."
609,00:38:49.20,00:38:49.20,>> I'd be lying if I saidit was any other way.
610,00:38:51.50,00:38:51.50,"And I think that, you know,that's just a harsh reality of"
