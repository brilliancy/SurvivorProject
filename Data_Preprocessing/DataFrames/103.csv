2,00:00:02.13,00:00:02.13,  JEFF PROBST:   16 Americans forced  to abandon ship
3,00:00:04.53,00:00:04.53, in the middle  of the South China Sea.
4,00:00:08.23,00:00:08.23, Marooned for 39 days
5,00:00:11.37,00:00:11.37," they must work together     to build shelter,"
6,00:00:13.83,00:00:13.83,  find food  and survive the island.
7,00:00:16.40,00:00:16.40," But ultimately, it is     everyone for themselves."
8,00:00:20.23,00:00:20.23," Every third night, they will     hike deep into the jungle"
9,00:00:23.30,00:00:23.30, to take part   in the Tribal Council
10,00:00:25.30,00:00:25.30,  where they must vote one   of their own off the island.
11,00:00:29.33,00:00:29.33,"In the end, only one will remain"
12,00:00:31.33,00:00:31.33,  and will leave the island
13,00:00:33.00,00:00:33.00,  with $1 million in cash.
14,00:00:38.60,00:00:38.60,  Last week on Survivor...
15,00:00:41.03,00:00:41.03,  B.B's anger   with the Pagong Tribe
16,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07,  reached a fevered pitch.
17,00:00:44.60,00:00:44.60,I've been working my ass off.
18,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17, A lot of you have been  laying on your ass watching me.
19,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83, Put the carrying log--    we're right in...
20,00:00:48.87,00:00:48.87,all the way over now.
21,00:00:50.20,00:00:50.20,"If we're building a health gym, I'll let you do it."
22,00:00:53.10,00:00:53.10,   Damn it. Walk    straight in.
23,00:00:55.03,00:00:55.03,"   It may not be that right,    but how many times we got"
24,00:00:56.83,00:00:56.83,to make those decisions?
25,00:00:58.03,00:00:58.03," JEFF:  At Tagi, the conflict"
26,00:00:59.83,00:00:59.83, between Stacey and Rudy     deepened.
27,00:01:02.30,00:01:02.30, RUDY:  Me and her wouldn't get along.
28,00:01:04.07,00:01:04.07,  If we were friends  on the outside
29,00:01:05.60,00:01:05.60,   I'd definitely avoid her.
30,00:01:07.33,00:01:07.33,"STACEY:   We've all seen him    eating extra food,"
31,00:01:09.07,00:01:09.07, and he's just sort of    a liability to us.
32,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50, He was sitting around  barking orders
33,00:01:12.27,00:01:12.27,and not really helping out much.
34,00:01:13.80,00:01:13.80," RUDY:  She's too prim-like, you know."
35,00:01:15.07,00:01:15.07,"  I mean, uh,"
36,00:01:16.87,00:01:16.87,after about three weeks out here in this jungle
37,00:01:19.00,00:01:19.00," she's going to learn a lesson, I think."
38,00:01:21.00,00:01:21.00, JEFF:    And Richard shared openly   with his tribe mates.
39,00:01:24.03,00:01:24.03,"  There is a lifestyle    associated with being gay,"
40,00:01:26.40,00:01:26.40,   but you can't say   I decided to be gay.
41,00:01:28.60,00:01:28.60," RUDY:    The homosexual, he's one  of the nicest guys I ever met."
42,00:01:32.57,00:01:32.57,  Me and Richard got to be   pretty good friends--
43,00:01:35.57,00:01:35.57,"not in a homosexual way, that's for sure."
44,00:01:38.17,00:01:38.17," JEFF:   At the immunity challenge,   Stacey pulled through"
45,00:01:40.70,00:01:40.70,  by winning the final unappetizing round...
46,00:01:43.70,00:01:43.70,SEAN: Swallow!
47,00:01:45.43,00:01:45.43,Open!
48,00:01:45.43,00:01:45.43,JEFF: Tagi!
49,00:01:48.03,00:01:48.03,  ...forcing Pagong   to take the long hike
50,00:01:50.23,00:01:50.23, to the Tribal Council
51,00:01:51.93,00:01:51.93, where B.B.'S   volatile personality
52,00:01:53.83,00:01:53.83,  finally caught up with him.
53,00:01:55.83,00:01:55.83,"  ""B.B."""
54,00:01:57.23,00:01:57.23," B.B., the tribe  has spoken."
55,00:02:00.63,00:02:00.63,  It's time   for you to go.
56,00:02:02.30,00:02:02.30,   All right.
57,00:02:03.33,00:02:03.33, JEFF:  14 Are left.
58,00:02:04.60,00:02:04.60,"  Tonight, one more will go."
59,00:03:00.40,00:03:00.40,  Captioning sponsored by CBS and SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
60,00:03:18.07,00:03:18.07, KELLY:    I keep forgetting  where I am...
61,00:03:20.13,00:03:20.13,when I wake up.
62,00:03:23.57,00:03:23.57,   The plan now is to go out
63,00:03:24.87,00:03:24.87, and try to do   some early morning fishing.
64,00:03:32.07,00:03:32.07, SEAN:  Fishing is horrible.
65,00:03:33.90,00:03:33.90," That saying, ""There's    a lot of fish in the sea""?"
66,00:03:35.83,00:03:35.83, Not this sea.
67,00:03:37.23,00:03:37.23," They apparently didn't grow up  in Palua Tiga,"
68,00:03:39.47,00:03:39.47,"  uh, because there is nothing to be caught out there."
69,00:03:42.27,00:03:42.27," SUSAN:    As far as     the food holding up, uh,"
70,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,   I don't... I think  we're into day seven.
71,00:03:48.20,00:03:48.20,"I lost track, but I know  it's starting to whittle down."
72,00:03:51.50,00:03:51.50,   I know we got to get fish in here.
73,00:03:53.07,00:03:53.07,  ( conch shell being blown )
74,00:03:54.97,00:03:54.97, SUSAN:    You want to check    the one on the left first?
75,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,KELLY AND STACEY: Yeah.
76,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,We're going by that first.
77,00:03:58.70,00:03:58.70," KELLY: Come on,    fish in the trap."
78,00:04:00.53,00:04:00.53,Rocks do not want to take her down on that one end.
79,00:04:03.83,00:04:03.83,Okay.
80,00:04:09.03,00:04:09.03,Nothing.
81,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30,Bait's all gone.
82,00:04:12.67,00:04:12.67, KELLY:  This is frustrating.
83,00:04:14.53,00:04:14.53,"I mean, it's the ocean."
84,00:04:16.53,00:04:16.53,"   You think you'd get a fish   somehow, but no luck so far."
85,00:04:20.80,00:04:20.80,"  We all thought, ""Oh, yeah,   you know, we got these traps,"
86,00:04:23.73,00:04:23.73," we got hooks, we got a raft."""
87,00:04:25.50,00:04:25.50,"  You know, there's no reason    why we shouldn't be having"
88,00:04:28.07,00:04:28.07,"  big, fat fish for dinner   every night,"
89,00:04:29.80,00:04:29.80,  but we're just not.
90,00:04:30.87,00:04:30.87,"   To me, that's kind of like"
91,00:04:32.90,00:04:32.90,"  uh, yeah, whoo-hoo, big survivors, you know?"
92,00:04:35.93,00:04:35.93,When was the last time Rudy went on a water run?
93,00:04:38.23,00:04:38.23,"   He never did, did he?"
94,00:04:39.57,00:04:39.57,I don't think he's been
95,00:04:40.57,00:04:40.57, on a water run.
96,00:04:41.70,00:04:41.70,  He's sneaky.
97,00:04:43.03,00:04:43.03,He is. He's sneaky.
98,00:04:44.70,00:04:44.70,  He swipes food
99,00:04:46.30,00:04:46.30,while he's in there cooking in the kitchen.
100,00:04:48.67,00:04:48.67,STACEY:    I think we've all sort of  come to the conclusion
101,00:04:51.30,00:04:51.30, that Rudy really needs    to get out of here.
102,00:04:53.23,00:04:53.23,   He just criticizes  whatever we're doing.
103,00:04:54.80,00:04:54.80,  He's hurting morale.
104,00:04:56.30,00:04:56.30,  We row out yesterday morning    and set the traps.
105,00:04:58.60,00:04:58.60,I come into the kitchen.
106,00:04:59.93,00:04:59.93,"""Morning, Rudy,   how are you doing?"""
107,00:05:01.87,00:05:01.87,"   ""You're wasting your time    out there."
108,00:05:03.43,00:05:03.43,"  It's just a waste."""
109,00:05:05.23,00:05:05.23,"  I was, like, ""Damn,  morning to you, too.""  What the hell."
110,00:05:06.63,00:05:06.63,"SUSAN: Well, he's wasting his time by doing nothing, though."
111,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67," KELLY:   I think we were all  kind of stoked that, you know,"
112,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,"  yeah, he's an ex-Navy Seal,"
113,00:05:13.27,00:05:13.27,  We're going to kick ass.
114,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63, But he really hasn't  contributed very much.
115,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77,I think it's definitely  going to influence me
116,00:05:18.57,00:05:18.57,   the next time I go    to Tribal Council.
117,00:05:20.90,00:05:20.90,"I think it's influencing   all of us, you know."
118,00:05:25.37,00:05:25.37," When it comes down, you know,"
119,00:05:27.47,00:05:27.47,"  to-to voting people    that we do like off, I..."
120,00:05:30.23,00:05:30.23,"it's sucky, but I think it's going to come down"
121,00:05:33.43,00:05:33.43,  to whoever screws up    at the challenges.
122,00:05:36.03,00:05:36.03,"  SUSAN:   Yeah, 'cause I already   know who I'd vote for."
123,00:05:38.83,00:05:38.83,The person that's least   contributing to the group...
124,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,  out of here.
125,00:05:44.07,00:05:44.07,  I have conflicts--   personality conflicts
126,00:05:45.90,00:05:45.90, every day with people.
127,00:05:47.40,00:05:47.40," I deal with them, I work with them, I live with them, I go on."
128,00:05:49.23,00:05:49.23,I'm going to do   the same thing here:
129,00:05:50.67,00:05:50.67,  I'm going to get rid
130,00:05:51.97,00:05:51.97, of the weakest member  and vote Stacey out.
131,00:05:53.40,00:05:53.40,  Stacey's trying to buddy up  with everybody
132,00:05:57.40,00:05:57.40,  because she knows    she's the weakest.
133,00:05:59.20,00:05:59.20,"STACEY:  When Kelly, Sue and I     were on the raft"
134,00:06:01.23,00:06:01.23, we talked about    who we'd vote off.
135,00:06:02.90,00:06:02.90,"   Sue initially didn't want    to talk about it,"
136,00:06:05.13,00:06:05.13, which immediately clued me in
137,00:06:06.67,00:06:06.67," that she was planning  to vote me off,"
138,00:06:08.63,00:06:08.63, even though we decided    to stick together.
139,00:06:10.27,00:06:10.27,"So now I don't trust her    as far as I can throw her,"
140,00:06:12.20,00:06:12.20," which, according to the group,    would be not far."
141,00:06:14.10,00:06:14.10,   Did you catch    anything?
142,00:06:16.63,00:06:16.63,SUSAN: No fish.
143,00:06:17.73,00:06:17.73,We set the traps up though.
144,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07,Set the fish traps?
145,00:06:21.17,00:06:21.17,That's it?
146,00:06:22.30,00:06:22.30,"  Just... yeah, no fish."
147,00:06:23.47,00:06:23.47, We didn't fish  but 20 minutes.
148,00:06:32.10,00:06:32.10,COLLEEN:   The oomph is a little gone  from our group.
149,00:06:35.00,00:06:35.00,  I don't know why that is.
150,00:06:36.60,00:06:36.60,I think that not eating is a factor of our mood.
151,00:06:39.07,00:06:39.07, We want food.
152,00:06:40.70,00:06:40.70,"  Gretchen, Colleen and Greg,"
153,00:06:42.60,00:06:42.60, they were out looking    for tapioca
154,00:06:44.70,00:06:44.70, so that we could have
155,00:06:46.13,00:06:46.13,  mashed-potato style   tapioca root.
156,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,"It's tapioca, for sure."
157,00:06:49.40,00:06:49.40,   ( all chuckling )
158,00:06:50.87,00:06:50.87,"Just take a bite, and see what..."
159,00:06:52.87,00:06:52.87,No. Maybe it's just tapioca run wild.
160,00:06:55.20,00:06:55.20, ( chuckling )
161,00:06:56.73,00:06:56.73,"Operation Tapioca has everything   to do with finding tapioca,"
162,00:07:00.37,00:07:00.37,"but we find other things on the way, too."
163,00:07:02.83,00:07:02.83,COLLEEN:   The first time I came upon  the mud volcano
164,00:07:06.93,00:07:06.93,  was with Gretchen and Greg.
165,00:07:08.53,00:07:08.53,"Oh, wow!"
166,00:07:10.93,00:07:10.93,   Look at this. Oh!
167,00:07:12.43,00:07:12.43, Is it blooping?
168,00:07:12.43,00:07:12.43,  Did you see that?
169,00:07:15.77,00:07:15.77,Oh! Oh...
170,00:07:17.63,00:07:17.63,   GRETCHEN:   We stopped at the mud volcanoes for a dip.
171,00:07:21.60,00:07:21.60,  We had a good time.
172,00:07:31.03,00:07:31.03,  ( laughing )
173,00:07:39.07,00:07:39.07,COLLEEN:   We walked out of the woods
174,00:07:41.30,00:07:41.30," like, you know,     Lord of the Flies,"
175,00:07:42.63,00:07:42.63,"  and, uh, I think the others"
176,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20, were quite interested     in our discovery
177,00:07:46.50,00:07:46.50, so we took a group field trip.
178,00:07:47.80,00:07:47.80,What is wrong with you people?
179,00:07:50.33,00:07:50.33," Oh, my God!"
180,00:07:58.47,00:07:58.47,GERVASE:  It was a great feeling.
181,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97, It's just like a nice little    celebration for everybody.
182,00:08:02.50,00:08:02.50,"   You get together, just get dirty,"
183,00:08:05.57,00:08:05.57,  and have a little fun--     have a couple of laughs.
184,00:08:08.17,00:08:08.17,COLLEEN: Whose leg is...?
185,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,Now we really don't want to be voted off.
186,00:08:13.50,00:08:13.50, JENNA:  But it's also just to get away    from the daily grind here.
187,00:08:16.93,00:08:16.93," I mean, we're going to be here 39 days."
188,00:08:18.27,00:08:18.27,You got to keep yourself happy.
189,00:08:45.63,00:08:45.63, RUDY:   I seen Dirk     reading his bible today.
190,00:08:48.97,00:08:48.97, I didn't know   he brought a bible.
191,00:08:51.20,00:08:51.20," ""For out of the heart   come evil thoughts:"
192,00:08:53.23,00:08:53.23,"   ""Murder, adultery,"
193,00:08:55.20,00:08:55.20,"   sexual immorality, theft,    false testimony, slander."""
194,00:08:58.60,00:08:58.60," DIRK:  I just need that quiet time,"
195,00:09:01.40,00:09:01.40, and especially a lot of that quiet time
196,00:09:03.80,00:09:03.80, includes just praying  and meditating
197,00:09:05.83,00:09:05.83,  and praising God.
198,00:09:07.40,00:09:07.40,  That's kind of where I feel    all my strength and energy
199,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00,  comes from.
200,00:09:11.50,00:09:11.50," My testimony is not something   I'm afraid to share,"
201,00:09:14.67,00:09:14.67,  and that's just part    of getting to know people
202,00:09:17.00,00:09:17.00,and at a deeper    and deeper level.
203,00:09:18.70,00:09:18.70,"   See, the Ten Commandments   was an old covenant"
204,00:09:21.30,00:09:21.30,that the Hebrews... that God's chosen nation--
205,00:09:23.27,00:09:23.27,"the Israelites,"
206,00:09:25.13,00:09:25.13,"the Hebrews-- had signed with him,"
207,00:09:27.67,00:09:27.67," but when Christ came,"
208,00:09:29.20,00:09:29.20,   he opened the door  to every human being on Earth.
209,00:09:31.27,00:09:31.27, SUSAN:  I can only take    so much preaching.
210,00:09:33.97,00:09:33.97,"   I went to church,    I put my time in."
211,00:09:36.37,00:09:36.37," I believe in God and all that,    but to constantly"
212,00:09:38.40,00:09:38.40,"  everything always come back on to ""Jesus, Jesus""..."
213,00:09:40.83,00:09:40.83,"   yeah, Dirk's about    driving me wild with that."
214,00:09:48.33,00:09:48.33,   It's getting even prettier  and prettier.
215,00:09:51.53,00:09:51.53,"Well, thank you."
216,00:09:53.40,00:09:53.40,STACEY:    I think Dirk has     a little crush on Kelly.
217,00:09:55.80,00:09:55.80,He doesn't have    a chance in hell.
218,00:09:57.90,00:09:57.90," Stacey came up to me,  ""Yeah, I think he likes you."""
219,00:10:00.53,00:10:00.53," I was just, like, ""oh, great,""    you know?"
220,00:10:02.50,00:10:02.50,"  I-I didn't come out here    for that, you know?"
221,00:10:04.90,00:10:04.90,  We don't need that.
222,00:10:06.53,00:10:06.53," DIRK:   Kelly's got   a serious boyfriend,"
223,00:10:09.43,00:10:09.43,"and unless she tells me    otherwise,"
224,00:10:10.77,00:10:10.77, that's a line I'm not going to cross.
225,00:10:12.30,00:10:12.30,I love you.
226,00:10:14.70,00:10:14.70,  But we're--  it's a platonic type of love.
227,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,  I think he's really   sexually frustrated.
228,00:10:19.97,00:10:19.97,  I've gone 23 years   without sex.
229,00:10:21.20,00:10:21.20, I think you guys  can go seven weeks.
230,00:10:22.67,00:10:22.67,SUSAN: I went a year one time.
231,00:10:23.93,00:10:23.93,"Oh, my God!"
232,00:10:25.00,00:10:25.00,SUSAN: You should try it sometime.
233,00:10:26.60,00:10:26.60,You might like it.
234,00:10:28.03,00:10:28.03," It's just funny, but..."
235,00:10:29.13,00:10:29.13,I know you'll like it.
236,00:10:30.57,00:10:30.57,"   No, I know I'm    going to love it."
237,00:10:31.63,00:10:31.63,You'll come back. You'll come back.
238,00:10:33.00,00:10:33.00,   It's a gift from God.
239,00:10:34.07,00:10:34.07,"  There's no doubt, man."
240,00:10:35.20,00:10:35.20,"  I'm obviously not a virgin,"
241,00:10:36.70,00:10:36.70,"but if he, uh..."
242,00:10:38.20,00:10:38.20,"  that's how he wants  to live his life, that's cool."
243,00:10:40.37,00:10:40.37, You don't meet too many   23-old guys who are virgins.
244,00:10:43.57,00:10:43.57,"   He's interesting,   being a virgin, 23,"
245,00:10:45.53,00:10:45.53," and not, uh, thinking"
246,00:10:47.13,00:10:47.13,  about crossing that line   till marriage-- hoo!
247,00:10:49.83,00:10:49.83,"He's extraordinarily religious,"
248,00:10:51.37,00:10:51.37,  and I don't know  that we'd ever be real close
249,00:10:53.50,00:10:53.50, because we're on such
250,00:10:54.93,00:10:54.93, different ends   of the spectrum religiously.
251,00:10:56.93,00:10:56.93," DIRK:    Rich, you know...  homosexual people tend to talk"
252,00:11:00.43,00:11:00.43,   about their homosexuality
253,00:11:01.90,00:11:01.90," all the time, and it's really annoying to me."
254,00:11:03.73,00:11:03.73,It's seems like you talk about sex an awful lot.
255,00:11:06.10,00:11:06.10,   Nobody's going to tell me  what not to do
256,00:11:07.90,00:11:07.90,   or what not to talk about.
257,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,   If it's offensive    to anybody
258,00:11:11.40,00:11:11.40,  I stop immediately.
259,00:11:13.77,00:11:13.77," DIRK:  Maybe that's just me,   but if he could cut that out"
260,00:11:16.30,00:11:16.30, it'd almost be perfect   around camp.
261,00:11:25.43,00:11:25.43,Day seven on the island.
262,00:11:27.87,00:11:27.87,  After Pagong's visit    to Tribal Council
263,00:11:29.67,00:11:29.67,both tribes are now even    at seven members.
264,00:11:32.33,00:11:32.33,  Today we'll see what effect    losing B.B. has on Pagong
265,00:11:34.93,00:11:34.93,as they prepare    for their next challenge.
266,00:11:37.70,00:11:37.70,"Both tribes will have their work cut out for them today,"
267,00:11:40.30,00:11:40.30,"as it requires strength,    endurance,"
268,00:11:43.23,00:11:43.23,"and most importantly, teamwork."
269,00:11:45.90,00:11:45.90,  Try to go this one alone...
270,00:11:47.40,00:11:47.40, you'll never make it to shore.
271,00:12:01.07,00:12:01.07,  Yes!
272,00:12:03.03,00:12:03.03,It's underwater.
273,00:12:09.43,00:12:09.43,"""Lucky for you there's not much to do"
274,00:12:12.30,00:12:12.30,"""to prepare for    the next big race."
275,00:12:15.13,00:12:15.13,"  ""Just hold on tight,    use all your might"
276,00:12:16.87,00:12:16.87,"   and stay down till    you're blue in the face."""
277,00:12:18.73,00:12:18.73,"Oh, we're going to go diving."
278,00:12:20.33,00:12:20.33,   Hold your breath.
279,00:12:21.77,00:12:21.77,"   ""Gasping for air,  weight you can't bear,"
280,00:12:23.33,00:12:23.33,"  ""before you're done  you may quit,"
281,00:12:25.13,00:12:25.13,"  ""the fish you desire   are yours to acquire"
282,00:12:27.50,00:12:27.50,"  if you're the first   to the sand spit."""
283,00:12:30.33,00:12:30.33,"Yeah, though, it's got to be underwater,"
284,00:12:32.40,00:12:32.40,"holding your breath,"
285,00:12:33.53,00:12:33.53,getting something and getting somewhere.
286,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20,Okay.
287,00:12:36.20,00:12:36.20,"Come on, Seal."
288,00:12:37.47,00:12:37.47,Who could do that?
289,00:12:39.17,00:12:39.17,"Well, that's what it is."
290,00:12:40.43,00:12:40.43, You know you're diving  for something.
291,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17," Something underwater,  I'm thinking."
292,00:12:50.43,00:12:50.43,   Yeah.
293,00:12:52.33,00:12:52.33,It's underwater today.
294,00:12:53.63,00:12:53.63,Cool.
295,00:12:54.97,00:12:54.97,Either lifting something from the bottom
296,00:12:56.67,00:12:56.67,"  or carrying it   underwater,"
297,00:12:58.00,00:12:58.00,   or a distant swim    underwater
298,00:12:59.07,00:12:59.07,   or something.
299,00:13:00.47,00:13:00.47,GERVASE:   The thing is this:
300,00:13:02.07,00:13:02.07,  everybody knew coming in     water wasn't my thing--
301,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,"  swimming wasn't my thing,    and my team"
302,00:13:06.00,00:13:06.00,"  knew it from the beginning,"
303,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50," so when we get into any kind  of swimming situation,"
304,00:13:09.60,00:13:09.60,"if it's actual swimming,  we're going to be struggling."
305,00:13:12.23,00:13:12.23,"  You know, they have  to compensate for me."
306,00:13:13.90,00:13:13.90,  But that's what a team does.
307,00:13:49.83,00:13:49.83,"  JEFF:   Hey, guys."
308,00:13:51.90,00:13:51.90,  ALL:   Hey!
309,00:13:54.30,00:13:54.30,"   Tagi, you, you saw    they're missing a member."
310,00:13:55.90,00:13:55.90, B.B. got voted off last night.
311,00:13:59.17,00:13:59.17,   Today's challenge  is a reward challenge.
312,00:14:01.07,00:14:01.07,  You won't be playing   for immunity today.
313,00:14:03.03,00:14:03.03, That'll happen later.
314,00:14:04.97,00:14:04.97,   Today's challenge strictly   for a reward
315,00:14:07.00,00:14:07.00, that includes a fishing spear.
316,00:14:09.50,00:14:09.50,   Here's the game...
317,00:14:10.50,00:14:10.50,   it is a team game.
318,00:14:11.80,00:14:11.80,   Big emphasis on the tribe.
319,00:14:13.53,00:14:13.53,   What you're going to do is you're going to swim out
320,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,   to the inner tubes    out in the water.
321,00:14:17.50,00:14:17.50, Directly below the inner tube  on either side
322,00:14:20.60,00:14:20.60,  is a sunken treasure chest.
323,00:14:21.93,00:14:21.93,  Get that chest back here
324,00:14:23.70,00:14:23.70,  up on your platform.
325,00:14:25.10,00:14:25.10,The game is over when one tribe   has their chest here
326,00:14:28.67,00:14:28.67,and every member has a hand on the chest.
327,00:14:30.77,00:14:30.77,The only rule is
328,00:14:32.37,00:14:32.37,  you can't dive down to get the chest
329,00:14:34.53,00:14:34.53,  until everybody is out there  with a hand on the inner tube.
330,00:14:37.10,00:14:37.10,So the race really starts here.
331,00:14:38.60,00:14:38.60, The quicker everybody  gets out there
332,00:14:40.10,00:14:40.10, the quicker you can dive down  and start to move it.
333,00:14:42.37,00:14:42.37,  Anything not clear?
334,00:14:43.93,00:14:43.93,  No?
335,00:14:45.27,00:14:45.27,"   Survivors, ready?"
336,00:14:46.27,00:14:46.27,Ready.
337,00:14:47.57,00:14:47.57,  Go!
338,00:15:14.00,00:15:14.00,Go! Here we go!
339,00:15:15.60,00:15:15.60,We're going down.
340,00:15:31.80,00:15:31.80,   I think you're...
341,00:15:32.83,00:15:32.83,I can't get ahold of it.
342,00:15:35.83,00:15:35.83,Everybody...
343,00:15:38.23,00:15:38.23,  Get your hand up.
344,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17, ( indistinct chatter )
345,00:16:19.20,00:16:19.20, ( indistinct chatter )
346,00:16:22.83,00:16:22.83,( all talking at once )
347,00:16:47.73,00:16:47.73,"...two, three."
348,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,   You okay?
349,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,Yeah.
350,00:17:05.37,00:17:05.37,( all talking )
351,00:17:12.50,00:17:12.50,Got it?
352,00:17:13.53,00:17:13.53,   I got it.
353,00:17:14.57,00:17:14.57,Come on! Come on!
354,00:17:15.90,00:17:15.90," Stay with us, here..."
355,00:17:25.37,00:17:25.37,"Hell, yeah."
356,00:17:26.43,00:17:26.43,"Our beach now, baby."
357,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,Our beach now.
358,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,"That's right, baby."
359,00:17:28.93,00:17:28.93,  ( shouting )
360,00:17:30.27,00:17:30.27, Put your hands on it!  Put your hands on it!
361,00:17:33.17,00:17:33.17, Tagi!
362,00:17:34.67,00:17:34.67,Yeah!
363,00:17:34.67,00:17:34.67,  Whoo!
364,00:17:35.70,00:17:35.70,  Way to go.
365,00:17:36.93,00:17:36.93,"  Bring it in, guys,   bring it in."
366,00:17:38.07,00:17:38.07,Nice job.
367,00:17:39.17,00:17:39.17," Man, way to get  it done, Rudy."
368,00:17:41.03,00:17:41.03,  ...than I imagined   it would be.
369,00:17:42.23,00:17:42.23,"By the time you get out, you're so..."
370,00:17:43.93,00:17:43.93,"Good work, guys."
371,00:17:45.53,00:17:45.53," JEFF:   All right, here's the deal."
372,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,"  The key, Mr. Hatch,  if you'd like,"
373,00:17:48.97,00:17:48.97,  to grab right there.
374,00:17:50.10,00:17:50.10,"Yeah, Rich, go get it, baby."
375,00:17:51.57,00:17:51.57,"  Go, Richard."
376,00:17:51.57,00:17:51.57,  Underneath.
377,00:17:54.07,00:17:54.07, ( indistinct chatter )
378,00:17:59.80,00:17:59.80,   ( tribe cheering )
379,00:18:01.97,00:18:01.97, Look at all  that booty!
380,00:18:03.47,00:18:03.47,"Oh, money, money."
381,00:18:11.67,00:18:11.67,   See you tomorrow.
382,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,( tribal yell )
383,00:18:28.60,00:18:28.60,RICHARD:  Yesterday's competition    was great.
384,00:18:30.47,00:18:30.47,"   That was the, uh, pulling the treasure up from the water,"
385,00:18:33.10,00:18:33.10,   dragging it in and getting   a mask and snorkel.
386,00:18:35.20,00:18:35.20," Oh, baby, that made me    feel good."
387,00:18:36.70,00:18:36.70, I wanted that mask and snorkel  from day one...
388,00:18:39.50,00:18:39.50," to go get, uh, fish."
389,00:18:58.50,00:18:58.50," SEAN:  Rich, he overestimates himself    sometimes,"
390,00:19:01.27,00:19:01.27,  and we were kind of thinking
391,00:19:02.80,00:19:02.80,  that he wasn't going    to catch anything.
392,00:19:03.80,00:19:03.80," When you snorkel down there,"
393,00:19:06.03,00:19:06.03,  there's nothing     to even stab at.
394,00:19:09.90,00:19:09.90,  We have a good pole.
395,00:19:10.93,00:19:10.93,  I have my Superpole.
396,00:19:12.60,00:19:12.60,"Uh, which is, you know,    it works--"
397,00:19:14.40,00:19:14.40, in a Gilligan's Island   sort of sense.
398,00:19:16.03,00:19:16.03,"  We got some maggots,"
399,00:19:17.63,00:19:17.63,   we got the Superpole 2000
400,00:19:19.40,00:19:19.40,   and we got the persistence of Dirk and me.
401,00:19:21.80,00:19:21.80, We can't lose.
402,00:19:26.47,00:19:26.47," Feeling good today,  buddy."
403,00:19:30.77,00:19:30.77,  We got to come back   with fish tonight.
404,00:19:33.60,00:19:33.60,If somebody gets a fish    on a spear
405,00:19:35.03,00:19:35.03,  I'll be seriously impressed.
406,00:19:36.40,00:19:36.40,So will I. Let's see if he can do it.
407,00:19:38.40,00:19:38.40," Well, Rich is confident, man. I appreciate..."
408,00:19:40.17,00:19:40.17,"If I was a little fish and saw Rich swimming out,"
409,00:19:41.70,00:19:41.70,I wouldn't be sticking around long.
410,00:19:43.27,00:19:43.27,Big gay man with a spear coming right at me.
411,00:20:14.27,00:20:14.27," Oh, it's a ray."
412,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,   I don't know if    it's an angel ray
413,00:20:17.03,00:20:17.03, or a sting ray.
414,00:20:18.87,00:20:18.87,"RICHARD:  This is a good moment for me,   'cause I knew people"
415,00:20:20.73,00:20:20.73, were thinking I was just full of caca.
416,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,   And it was just...
417,00:20:24.20,00:20:24.20," you know, one of those things"
418,00:20:25.73,00:20:25.73," that I've been  talking about fishing,"
419,00:20:27.50,00:20:27.50, talking about what I've     been doing all my life...
420,00:20:30.07,00:20:30.07,  We're supposed   to eat that thing?
421,00:20:31.40,00:20:31.40,I will.
422,00:20:32.60,00:20:32.60,Just to make note
423,00:20:33.93,00:20:33.93,who got the first fish.
424,00:20:35.23,00:20:35.23,It's not a fish; it's a ray.
425,00:20:37.07,00:20:37.07,Oh! Oh! You suck.
426,00:20:38.20,00:20:38.20,I'm coming back in a second
427,00:20:40.20,00:20:40.20,  with a fish.
428,00:20:41.67,00:20:41.67, I actually think Sean  was kind of sad
429,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,that I beat him.
430,00:21:01.13,00:21:01.13,   All right.
431,00:21:14.73,00:21:14.73,"Another ray, huh?"
432,00:21:15.97,00:21:15.97,Now you got two.
433,00:21:17.27,00:21:17.27,Do we want another ray?
434,00:21:19.10,00:21:19.10, We don't know    if they taste good
435,00:21:20.17,00:21:20.17, or if they're edible.
436,00:21:21.63,00:21:21.63,"   Sean said, ""Get something that looks like a fish."""
437,00:21:23.57,00:21:23.57,This is a fish.
438,00:21:24.93,00:21:24.93," Look at that,   doesn't that look delicious?"
439,00:21:26.60,00:21:26.60,   No more rays.
440,00:21:28.47,00:21:28.47,   Catch a fish.
441,00:21:30.23,00:21:30.23,"If I see a fish, I'll get a fish."
442,00:21:31.77,00:21:31.77,"   But if I get rays,  I'm going to get rays."
443,00:21:33.30,00:21:33.30,There are seven people to feed.
444,00:21:34.70,00:21:34.70,I don't know if they taste good.
445,00:21:36.20,00:21:36.20,I'm not sure I'm following the logic.
446,00:21:37.87,00:21:37.87,"I mean, you're sitting here fishing..."
447,00:21:37.87,00:21:37.87,   Right.
448,00:21:39.63,00:21:39.63,For what?
449,00:21:40.93,00:21:40.93,I see a fish or something that looks like a fish--
450,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,"   I mean, I'll eat whatever."
451,00:21:45.20,00:21:45.20,"Finally, when I came up with a third one"
452,00:21:46.67,00:21:46.67,"  they said,   ""Good job, good job."""
453,00:21:47.77,00:21:47.77,  Good work.
454,00:21:49.53,00:21:49.53, SEAN:   He pulled through.    He showed his true colors.
455,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,He does know how to spear fish.
456,00:21:52.50,00:21:52.50," He got us a couple of,"
457,00:21:54.07,00:21:54.07,"   uh, manta rays or whatever   the hell they were."
458,00:21:55.90,00:21:55.90,  We got fish.
459,00:21:57.00,00:21:57.00,No way! No way!
460,00:21:59.50,00:21:59.50,  ( screams )
461,00:22:00.60,00:22:00.60,Watch the spear.
462,00:22:02.50,00:22:02.50,"   Hey, baby."
463,00:22:03.57,00:22:03.57," Oh, hell, yeah."
464,00:22:04.67,00:22:04.67,We're eating dinner.
465,00:22:05.80,00:22:05.80,RICHARD:  My position with the tribe--
466,00:22:08.10,00:22:08.10,it's probably going to increase   as a result of this.
467,00:22:10.40,00:22:10.40, I talk about the things     that I'm capable of doing
468,00:22:13.97,00:22:13.97, and this might give them that
469,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97," ""Oh, maybe some of what   he's saying is true."""
470,00:22:21.27,00:22:21.27,"They're, uh, pretty,"
471,00:22:22.73,00:22:22.73,  pretty damn tasty.   I recommend
472,00:22:24.57,00:22:24.57,  keep catching those...   they appear to be
473,00:22:26.27,00:22:26.27,"   slow, slow, slow."
474,00:22:27.73,00:22:27.73, Or you know how  to catch them.
475,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,  RICHARD:   Thank you.
476,00:22:30.33,00:22:30.33, You need to keep me
477,00:22:31.70,00:22:31.70, and I'll provide you  with the fish you need.
478,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,SEAN: I don't what I'd do without the gay perspective anyway.
479,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,  ( laughs )
480,00:23:04.40,00:23:04.40, I don't see it at all.
481,00:23:08.20,00:23:08.20,We heard a rumor   that the other team
482,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,caught a fish with their spear.
483,00:23:11.87,00:23:11.87,   The mask--   that was definitely the key
484,00:23:13.73,00:23:13.73, to them starting to get fish.
485,00:23:17.80,00:23:17.80, And that does worry me   a little bit
486,00:23:19.30,00:23:19.30,   'cause they're going to be   eating some protein.
487,00:23:20.90,00:23:20.90,"   I would definitely rather    have fish than rat, but..."
488,00:23:24.20,00:23:24.20,now it doesn't matter--  either/or now.
489,00:23:28.07,00:23:28.07," JENNA:  Ho, I'm so ready to eat rat."
490,00:23:30.27,00:23:30.27,"  I want to gut 'em, bone 'em,"
491,00:23:31.83,00:23:31.83,"   and then we'll have, like,   some little rat meat"
492,00:23:33.77,00:23:33.77,in with the rice    that we're eating.
493,00:23:35.00,00:23:35.00,That would be delicious.
494,00:23:39.17,00:23:39.17,  I'm not sure   what a rat might taste like.
495,00:23:40.73,00:23:40.73,  Nobody's said anything to me about what it could taste like.
496,00:23:43.00,00:23:43.00,GERVASE:   Anytime anybody can hit one
497,00:23:45.10,00:23:45.10,"  over the head, we're hitting them over the head, too."
498,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87,   Gretchen hit one    the other night--
499,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17, last night--   with the soup spoon.
500,00:23:50.83,00:23:50.83,  GREG:   This is not   an easy sport.
501,00:23:52.77,00:23:52.77," Oh, no."
502,00:23:55.03,00:23:55.03,( laughing ): That's me!
503,00:23:58.03,00:23:58.03,   The principle of the trap:
504,00:24:00.80,00:24:00.80, This noose is wrapped around  the inside of this area here.
505,00:24:04.50,00:24:04.50,  The bait's in there
506,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,  and it's getting tugged out  by the rat...
507,00:24:11.30,00:24:11.30,   and the noose goes tight.
508,00:24:23.63,00:24:23.63, JOEL:    So here's our plan    with the rats.
509,00:24:25.80,00:24:25.80,   We're going to    chop the head off
510,00:24:27.37,00:24:27.37,"  take the guts out,   take the skin off,"
511,00:24:29.77,00:24:29.77,"   cut the feet off,    and pull the skin    off that way..."
512,00:24:32.73,00:24:32.73," throw a few minnows in there,"
513,00:24:34.50,00:24:34.50,   surf and turf;    minnows and rats.
514,00:24:35.87,00:24:35.87,   ( laughing ):    All right!
515,00:24:37.57,00:24:37.57,I'm telling you guys
516,00:24:38.87,00:24:38.87,we're not going   to want to go home.
517,00:24:40.27,00:24:40.27,   We're set.
518,00:24:41.50,00:24:41.50,"  Bring 'em on, baby.  Bring 'em on."
519,00:25:05.40,00:25:05.40, GREG:    Rats aren't bad.  Rats are rats.
520,00:25:07.83,00:25:07.83, Questions of edibility
521,00:25:09.07,00:25:09.07,only have to do  with your perceptions.
522,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,GERVASE: Smells good.
523,00:25:38.80,00:25:38.80,"Oh, yeah. We're stylin'."
524,00:25:40.27,00:25:40.27,Want some?
525,00:25:41.60,00:25:41.60,"RAMONA: Uh, what does it taste like?"
526,00:25:43.37,00:25:43.37,   I'm not sure.
527,00:25:44.90,00:25:44.90,Rat?
528,00:25:46.40,00:25:46.40,Tastes like rat.
529,00:25:47.97,00:25:47.97,"Almost like chicken, a little bit."
530,00:25:49.87,00:25:49.87,   Use your imagination.
531,00:25:51.20,00:25:51.20,Am I using a lot  of imagination?
532,00:25:53.23,00:25:53.23, Don't smell it.
533,00:25:54.97,00:25:54.97, Don't smell it?
534,00:25:56.27,00:25:56.27, No.
535,00:25:57.70,00:25:57.70, I'm concerned    that it'll be a bit gamy.
536,00:25:59.80,00:25:59.80," We won't have quite the gravy    we're looking for,"
537,00:26:02.20,00:26:02.20, which would really be helpful.
538,00:26:03.97,00:26:03.97," Uh, when cooking rats"
539,00:26:05.60,00:26:05.60,  I would imagine the sauce   is of the utmost importance.
540,00:26:08.03,00:26:08.03,"As poor as we get in the ghetto,   we don't ever eat the rats."
541,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50, Ever.
542,00:26:14.57,00:26:14.57," Well, you guys  are missing something."
543,00:26:16.23,00:26:16.23,  ( laughing )
544,00:26:17.27,00:26:17.27,( groans )
545,00:26:19.60,00:26:19.60, Here.
546,00:26:27.53,00:26:27.53,   All right.
547,00:26:29.07,00:26:29.07,   ( clears throat )
548,00:26:52.13,00:26:52.13,Gervase?
549,00:26:54.30,00:26:54.30,  What do you think?
550,00:26:55.97,00:26:55.97,  You having a   problem there?
551,00:26:58.40,00:26:58.40,We gots to kill some more rats tonight.
552,00:27:01.70,00:27:01.70,( laughing with Joel )
553,00:27:03.30,00:27:03.30,"It's on, till the break of dawn,"
554,00:27:06.50,00:27:06.50,like hot buttered popcorn!
555,00:27:09.43,00:27:09.43,"   Oh, yeah."
556,00:27:10.43,00:27:10.43,  We's about the grub.
557,00:27:13.20,00:27:13.20,"  Joel, can you pass the rat?"
558,00:27:15.53,00:27:15.53,Please?
559,00:27:17.07,00:27:17.07,"Why you hogging the rat, Joel?"
560,00:27:18.63,00:27:18.63, Now everybody's taking my rat.
561,00:27:22.20,00:27:22.20,"  They're really, really good."
562,00:27:24.13,00:27:24.13,GERVASE:  There's plenty of food  on the island.
563,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,  You won't starve   with all these rats.
564,00:27:27.77,00:27:27.77,"  There's tons of them  and they're everywhere, so..."
565,00:27:30.23,00:27:30.23,there's definitely stuff to eat out here.
566,00:27:32.27,00:27:32.27, I think people  would just rather eat
567,00:27:33.90,00:27:33.90," some fish instead, that's all."
568,00:27:45.13,00:27:45.13,   We've got a clue.
569,00:27:46.20,00:27:46.20,RICHARD: Cool.
570,00:27:47.40,00:27:47.40,"""Next challenge, choose smallest member. Stop."
571,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,"""The lighter, the better. Stop."
572,00:27:52.80,00:27:52.80,"""An emergency has come up. Stop."
573,00:27:55.20,00:27:55.20,"""Build sturdy, maneuverable structure. Stop."
574,00:27:58.67,00:27:58.67," Tribe's fate may depend on it.  Stop."""
575,00:28:01.30,00:28:01.30,That would be Kelly.
576,00:28:02.43,00:28:02.43," We probably have to carry her,"
577,00:28:04.13,00:28:04.13,"   or something, somewhere-- a race."
578,00:28:05.73,00:28:05.73,Through the woods. Maneuverable.
579,00:28:05.73,00:28:05.73,"Right, right."
580,00:28:07.73,00:28:07.73,RICHARD:  Today's immunity challenge day
581,00:28:09.77,00:28:09.77,"   so we're building a, uh...    stretcher."
582,00:28:11.67,00:28:11.67,Got to be a strong one.
583,00:28:13.27,00:28:13.27," We don't know for what    but, uh..."
584,00:28:14.97,00:28:14.97," obviously, it's a competition"
585,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,   that's going to determine who kicks somebody out tonight.
586,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,"RICHARD: We got our mission, Rudy."
587,00:28:22.07,00:28:22.07,Looks like we got to build a stretcher.
588,00:28:24.40,00:28:24.40, Bamboo... bamboo...
589,00:28:26.87,00:28:26.87,"   chicken wire in here,"
590,00:28:29.13,00:28:29.13,a brace here and a brace there.
591,00:28:34.23,00:28:34.23,"   All right, set it    up right there."
592,00:28:42.03,00:28:42.03,Looks like the head's rusty.
593,00:28:44.33,00:28:44.33, SUSAN:  It's important to keep    winning these games because
594,00:28:47.07,00:28:47.07," for one, you win the immunity."
595,00:28:48.60,00:28:48.60,  You don't have to go through worrying
596,00:28:50.00,00:28:50.00, about kicking somebody  off your team.
597,00:28:51.67,00:28:51.67,"STACEY:   In general,    we're a really tight group."
598,00:28:53.77,00:28:53.77,  We all have our individual strengths
599,00:28:55.37,00:28:55.37,"  and we're pulling together,"
600,00:28:56.80,00:28:56.80," it's just, if we could   get Rudy out of here"
601,00:28:58.97,00:28:58.97, I think we'd be even stronger.
602,00:29:01.40,00:29:01.40,"It's going to have to be rope,"
603,00:29:02.70,00:29:02.70, not that little  stuff we got.
604,00:29:04.03,00:29:04.03,"No, we got three rolls of the rope, Rudy."
605,00:29:10.47,00:29:10.47,  It's hanging there.
606,00:29:12.43,00:29:12.43,  Why don't you   just tie the rope?
607,00:29:14.03,00:29:14.03, ( indistinct chatter )
608,00:29:15.57,00:29:15.57,"How do you feel, Kell?"
609,00:29:16.63,00:29:16.63, I feel secure.
610,00:29:18.87,00:29:18.87," Lookin' good!    Go, baby!"
611,00:29:20.60,00:29:20.60, Baby!

633,00:30:02.43,00:30:02.43, I don't know.
634,00:30:03.50,00:30:03.50,   We have some idea.
635,00:30:04.83,00:30:04.83, It's going to involve  the stretcher
636,00:30:06.37,00:30:06.37,  and an evacuation-- an emergency-type thing.
637,00:30:09.20,00:30:09.20,"  We got to win, guys."
638,00:30:11.27,00:30:11.27," We're feeling a little bit defensive,"
639,00:30:13.07,00:30:13.07, but we're also feeling    like we can do it.
640,00:30:14.77,00:30:14.77,  We can beat them   'cause we got a light person
641,00:30:16.10,00:30:16.10,  and a strong team   pulling her.
642,00:30:17.27,00:30:17.27,It's not going to be the most comfortable ride
643,00:30:19.30,00:30:19.30, she's ever had.
644,00:30:27.03,00:30:27.03,Everybody ready?

650,00:30:39.87,00:30:39.87,   Good job.
651,00:30:52.07,00:30:52.07,"   Hey, guys.  Welcome to Larai Larai Beach."
652,00:30:54.80,00:30:54.80,  Another immunity challenge.
653,00:30:56.97,00:30:56.97,  You guys got a note   asking to build a stretcher.
654,00:30:59.40,00:30:59.40,  You were also asked   to pick one member.
655,00:31:01.37,00:31:01.37,"  An hour ago, we took those two people"
656,00:31:02.90,00:31:02.90,  and placed them in a secret location in the jungle.
657,00:31:06.93,00:31:06.93, This is an immunity challenge.
658,00:31:08.63,00:31:08.63,"   You know what that means,    but let me spell it out:"
659,00:31:10.57,00:31:10.57, The losers are going  to the Tribal Council
660,00:31:12.37,00:31:12.37,   where you have to vote off another member.
661,00:31:14.03,00:31:14.03,"  All right, for the scenario,  I just need one leader"
662,00:31:15.47,00:31:15.47, from each team to come up here.
663,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50, I'll take that immunity idol.
664,00:31:19.50,00:31:19.50,That's fair game again.
665,00:31:21.13,00:31:21.13,  For today's scenario
666,00:31:22.47,00:31:22.47,imagine there's   been a plane wreck--
667,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53, this plane right here.
668,00:31:25.93,00:31:25.93, On that plane was one  of your tribe members.
669,00:31:27.70,00:31:27.70, The good news is they're okay.
670,00:31:29.27,00:31:29.27,They had a parachute on.
671,00:31:30.43,00:31:30.43, The bad news is they are stuck
672,00:31:32.10,00:31:32.10,"  up in this jungle,   hanging from a tree."
673,00:31:34.50,00:31:34.50,"  Your job is to take  your stretcher,"
674,00:31:36.23,00:31:36.23, get up here to where they are and get them back down.
675,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,They are equal distance  from the beach
676,00:31:41.43,00:31:41.43, so everything is fair.
677,00:31:43.23,00:31:43.23,  Once you get back down here
678,00:31:44.67,00:31:44.67,it's a sprint from here
679,00:31:45.97,00:31:45.97,all the way down  to our first aid tent.
680,00:31:47.60,00:31:47.60,You have to have all six people
681,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,with one hand on the stretcher.
682,00:31:51.03,00:31:51.03,You guys ready?
683,00:31:53.37,00:31:53.37,Survivors ready?
684,00:31:55.27,00:31:55.27,   This is for immunity. Go!
685,00:32:00.53,00:32:00.53," Go, go, go!"
686,00:32:10.50,00:32:10.50, ( screaming ):  Help!
687,00:32:11.50,00:32:11.50,( Colleen screaming )

689,00:32:14.60,00:32:14.60,I'm right here! I'm right here!
690,00:32:15.87,00:32:15.87,You're so close!

692,00:32:22.20,00:32:22.20,"   Colleen, where are you at?"
693,00:32:23.30,00:32:23.30, ( Colleen screaming )
694,00:32:24.40,00:32:24.40,   ( cawing )
695,00:32:25.43,00:32:25.43,"Here, here! Get me down!"
696,00:32:26.53,00:32:26.53,"  All right, you guys."
697,00:32:27.73,00:32:27.73,  We so have this one.
698,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,Stand on my shoulders.
699,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,   All I can do
700,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,  is take this down...
701,00:32:31.67,00:32:31.67,You got it?
702,00:32:32.90,00:32:32.90,Almost.
703,00:32:34.23,00:32:34.23,Are you loose?
704,00:32:34.23,00:32:34.23,No!
705,00:32:35.47,00:32:35.47, I need to go up more.
706,00:32:36.83,00:32:36.83,Okay.
707,00:32:36.83,00:32:36.83,You got it?
708,00:32:37.83,00:32:37.83,Yeah.
709,00:32:38.97,00:32:38.97,Are you loose? Let's go.
710,00:32:40.23,00:32:40.23,"   Tagi, come on and help me!"
711,00:32:43.53,00:32:43.53,   I'm dying up here!
712,00:32:44.97,00:32:44.97,"Come on, you guys!"
713,00:32:46.17,00:32:46.17,   All right.
714,00:32:47.20,00:32:47.20,"Rich, I need you up here!"
715,00:32:48.87,00:32:48.87, Here we go.  I'm here.
716,00:32:50.30,00:32:50.30,"   Quick, get underneath her!"
717,00:32:52.40,00:32:52.40,  Stand up tall!
718,00:32:53.47,00:32:53.47,Good! She's down!
719,00:32:55.37,00:32:55.37,   You got to get me.
720,00:32:56.40,00:32:56.40, Got her.  Get it off.
721,00:32:57.63,00:32:57.63,   You guys have to carry me.
722,00:33:00.77,00:33:00.77,Let's go.
723,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,Take it.
724,00:33:03.87,00:33:03.87,   You got the flag?
725,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,Yeah.
726,00:33:06.60,00:33:06.60,"   If it gets in    the way, drop it."
727,00:33:15.40,00:33:15.40," We got her,  we got her."
728,00:33:17.47,00:33:17.47,"   Keep going, guys."
729,00:33:18.90,00:33:18.90,We got this one.
730,00:33:19.97,00:33:19.97,   Hold onto me.

740,00:33:55.30,00:33:55.30," Nice job, guys."

742,00:34:08.10,00:34:08.10,"JEFF: Tagi, Tribal Council tonight."
743,00:34:10.77,00:34:10.77,  I know that's going to   be a tough decision
744,00:34:12.80,00:34:12.80,  who you guys are   going to vote off.
745,00:34:14.67,00:34:14.67,"   You got the afternoon    to think about it,"
746,00:34:16.37,00:34:16.37,and I'll see you at the council tonight.
747,00:34:18.27,00:34:18.27,...all over my back.
748,00:34:21.70,00:34:21.70, SUSAN:   We just got to get some fish to keep our strength up.
749,00:34:24.10,00:34:24.10,Yeah.
750,00:34:25.13,00:34:25.13,I don't want to do this tonight.
751,00:34:27.03,00:34:27.03,This is the worst one.
752,00:34:28.63,00:34:28.63,"Yo, guys, the good news  about winning:"
753,00:34:29.87,00:34:29.87, we have a little victory walk planned for you.
754,00:34:31.83,00:34:31.83,  I don't know if you've been   to Bird Island yet--
755,00:34:33.60,00:34:33.60,   it is beautiful--
756,00:34:35.20,00:34:35.20,"   and there awaits, hanging    in the tree like Colleen,"
757,00:34:37.33,00:34:37.33,  your immunity idol.

761,00:35:26.30,00:35:26.30,STACEY:  Since we lost    the challenge today
762,00:35:28.70,00:35:28.70,"   we go back to the council   tonight-- fun, fun."
763,00:35:32.00,00:35:32.00,"Well, having lost the challenge,"
764,00:35:33.43,00:35:33.43,   we've got to vote   somebody out again.
765,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90, That's what happens every time  we lose an immunity challenge.
766,00:35:37.53,00:35:37.53, ( whistling )
767,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57, KELLY:    I don't think it's going    to get any easier.
768,00:35:43.37,00:35:43.37,"   You know,  every time we go there"
769,00:35:45.30,00:35:45.30,it's just going    to suck even more.
770,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,STACEY:  We haven't been    in this council in six days
771,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00, and in those six days
772,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60,"  we've all gotten to know each other pretty well,"
773,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10," and I feel bad    'cause I know they're all,"
774,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,"  you know, as scared"
775,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50," about being, you know,    voted off as I am."
776,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57, I thought it was a done deal
777,00:36:01.43,00:36:01.43,"that Rudy would be the next one     off, but it could be me."
778,00:36:04.40,00:36:04.40, I don't know.
779,00:36:05.60,00:36:05.60,   It's either going to be me
780,00:36:07.73,00:36:07.73,"  or Stacey, you know,   that get voted off."
781,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,  I think the younger people    are going to band together.
782,00:36:13.97,00:36:13.97, They're going to get rid of me
783,00:36:16.00,00:36:16.00, then they got     to cutthroat each other.
784,00:36:17.87,00:36:17.87, I'm going to vote Stacey out  at the council tonight
785,00:36:20.23,00:36:20.23, 'cause I don't like her
786,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,  and I never will.
787,00:36:24.53,00:36:24.53, SUSAN:  I told Stacey   I was going to vote for Rudy.
788,00:36:25.97,00:36:25.97,  But I was thinking about  voting for her
789,00:36:27.07,00:36:27.07,  'cause she was the weakest.
790,00:36:28.77,00:36:28.77,  I got to think of the team;    that's what I'm here for.
791,00:36:30.73,00:36:30.73,RICHARD: I've kind of prioritized people
792,00:36:33.97,00:36:33.97,"  based on who's contributing, I think,"
793,00:36:37.77,00:36:37.77, and can contribute most   to the competitions.
794,00:36:39.90,00:36:39.90, I even wanted  to talk with the group
795,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43, about who we were voting for
796,00:36:43.10,00:36:43.10," and let's, you know,     before we even go, know,"
797,00:36:45.20,00:36:45.20,"  so we could talk  with the people, but..."
798,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33," boy, did that not fly."
799,00:36:49.93,00:36:49.93,( thunderclap )
800,00:36:54.47,00:36:54.47, KELLY:  I don't think anybody's     out here to make friends.
801,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,  I'm not out here     to make friends.
802,00:36:59.20,00:36:59.20,"  People that you're forming    alliances with now,"
803,00:37:01.30,00:37:01.30,"  and the people that  you're getting along with now,"
804,00:37:03.70,00:37:03.70, are the people  that are going to have
805,00:37:05.50,00:37:05.50," to turn around and vote you,     but somebody's got to go."
806,00:37:08.73,00:37:08.73," So, it's just the way it goes."
807,00:37:10.90,00:37:10.90,( thunderclap )
808,00:37:24.60,00:37:24.60,( gong ringing )
809,00:37:37.60,00:37:37.60,Go ahead and place your torches    in their slots behind you.
810,00:37:41.67,00:37:41.67,Take a seat.
811,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33, I thought about  you earlier;
812,00:37:45.20,00:37:45.20, making the long  walk from your camp
813,00:37:46.63,00:37:46.63,"  to the middle of the jungle,"
814,00:37:48.27,00:37:48.27,   to Tribal Council    on what has been
815,00:37:49.70,00:37:49.70,one of the weirdest weather days    we've had so far.
816,00:37:52.53,00:37:52.53,"   20 minutes ago,    it was as hot    as it's ever been"
817,00:37:55.03,00:37:55.03, and now we have  as big a storm  as we've seen.
818,00:37:57.20,00:37:57.20,Going to try a couple of things   differently tonight.
819,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,   One is this conch shell--
820,00:38:01.80,00:38:01.80,the whole idea being to see if we can get
821,00:38:03.60,00:38:03.60, to a little  more truth.
822,00:38:05.03,00:38:05.03,"  You ought to be   able to feel safe,"
823,00:38:06.63,00:38:06.63,to say things here that maybe you can't say back at camp.
824,00:38:09.43,00:38:09.43,"  So, is there anybody here that   has something on their mind?"
825,00:38:12.20,00:38:12.20," Have at it,  Richard."
826,00:38:14.07,00:38:14.07,   Keep me. I'm    getting the fish.
827,00:38:15.93,00:38:15.93,   ( laughs )
828,00:38:17.73,00:38:17.73,   I'm bringing in the fish;    don't vote me out.
829,00:38:19.63,00:38:19.63,JEFF: Fair enough.
830,00:38:20.70,00:38:20.70,"  Sean, you and   Dirk went out,"
831,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37, tried to catch fish  for a few days.
832,00:38:24.83,00:38:24.83, Went out again today.
833,00:38:26.03,00:38:26.03,Went out again today.
834,00:38:27.37,00:38:27.37,"Do you feel, even though you're putting forth the effort,"
835,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,  do you feel a bit threatened by the fact that
836,00:38:31.73,00:38:31.73, when it comes   to assessing people's worth
837,00:38:33.87,00:38:33.87,  Richard did deliver and you haven't
838,00:38:35.27,00:38:35.27," been able to  catch any fish,"
839,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67, or is that just  one aspect?
840,00:38:38.03,00:38:38.03,"No, I don't think so right now, at this point,"
841,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,but I think that Richard  catching fish
842,00:38:41.87,00:38:41.87,"is great for the group,"
843,00:38:43.00,00:38:43.00,and I'm pretty comfortable with my position.
844,00:38:45.03,00:38:45.03,"I'm somewhat entertaining, sometimes."
845,00:38:46.77,00:38:46.77,"I make people laugh, and I'm keeping people healthy"
846,00:38:49.23,00:38:49.23,"  and, uh, so I'm comfortable  with my role--"
847,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,fishless or fishworthy.
848,00:38:52.73,00:38:52.73,"   Susan, you've been"
849,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,  quiet tonight.
850,00:38:55.90,00:38:55.90,What are you thinking right now?
851,00:38:57.47,00:38:57.47,"  I'm thinking right now that,  um, the elimination..."
852,00:39:01.27,00:39:01.27,   the way we vote is because of the... competition--
853,00:39:04.73,00:39:04.73,  it's like Rich getting fish  for the group.
854,00:39:07.80,00:39:07.80,   That's not coming    into foreplay yet
855,00:39:09.40,00:39:09.40,   'cause we're not starving  to death yet.
856,00:39:11.30,00:39:11.30,"Maybe by day 20, we'll be, like, yeah, he can catch fish,"
857,00:39:15.50,00:39:15.50,"he's staying around,"
858,00:39:16.70,00:39:16.70," you know, but, uh..."
859,00:39:18.50,00:39:18.50,"All right, it's raining too hard"
860,00:39:20.30,00:39:20.30,  to put you guys through this   any longer.
861,00:39:22.27,00:39:22.27, Anybody want to  say anything at all  in this downpour?
862,00:39:24.67,00:39:24.67," Stacey, the  floor is yours."
863,00:39:26.27,00:39:26.27,"Yeah, you guys,"
864,00:39:27.50,00:39:27.50, I daresay I was happy to eat the bugs
865,00:39:29.50,00:39:29.50,that kept us out of here
866,00:39:31.03,00:39:31.03,"last time,"
867,00:39:33.03,00:39:33.03,"and the games coming up are my real strong point, so..."
868,00:39:35.40,00:39:35.40,"JEFF: All right, guys."
869,00:39:37.67,00:39:37.67,You got to survive the vote
870,00:39:39.33,00:39:39.33,   to keep going on.
871,00:39:40.63,00:39:40.63,"So, Sean, start us off."
872,00:39:45.80,00:39:45.80,"  It's going to be a downpour,  buddy. Write clearly."
873,00:39:57.20,00:39:57.20, I'm voting for Stacey.
874,00:39:59.80,00:39:59.80," Um, nothing personal."
875,00:40:01.67,00:40:01.67,I just feel that we need   as much athleticism
876,00:40:04.17,00:40:04.17,and brute force   in this competition.
877,00:40:05.80,00:40:05.80,  I love her to death
878,00:40:07.33,00:40:07.33,   and this is no reflection  on the type of person she is.
879,00:40:30.80,00:40:30.80, Rudy.
880,00:41:22.27,00:41:22.27,"  I'll make this quick, guys."
881,00:41:23.53,00:41:23.53, I'll tally the votes.
882,00:41:38.47,00:41:38.47,  Once the votes   are tallied
883,00:41:40.47,00:41:40.47,the decision is final
884,00:41:42.07,00:41:42.07,  and the person   voted off
885,00:41:43.27,00:41:43.27,will need to leave the island immediately.
886,00:41:45.30,00:41:45.30,The good news is
887,00:41:46.67,00:41:46.67, you'll soon be drier.
888,00:41:48.40,00:41:48.40,"With that, I will, uh..."
889,00:41:49.77,00:41:49.77, read the names.
890,00:41:55.23,00:41:55.23, First vote...
891,00:41:58.20,00:41:58.20,"   ""Stacey."""
892,00:42:05.30,00:42:05.30,"   Next vote, fading,"
893,00:42:07.37,00:42:07.37,"""Rudy."""
894,00:42:12.00,00:42:12.00,"   ""Stacey."""
895,00:42:21.43,00:42:21.43,"""Rudy."""
896,00:42:22.47,00:42:22.47," That's two  votes for Rudy,"
897,00:42:24.57,00:42:24.57, two votes  for Stacey.
898,00:42:30.20,00:42:30.20,"   ""Stacey."""
899,00:42:37.30,00:42:37.30,"   ""Stacey."""
900,00:42:40.00,00:42:40.00,"  That's four   votes, Stacey."
901,00:42:41.90,00:42:41.90,  That's a majority.
902,00:42:43.37,00:42:43.37,  We don't need to   read the last one.
903,00:42:45.33,00:42:45.33,"STACEY:    All right, you switched your vote."
904,00:42:47.50,00:42:47.50,   JEFF:    You need to bring    me your torch
905,00:42:49.00,00:42:49.00," if you would, please.    Thank you."
906,00:42:51.60,00:42:51.60, Thanks.
907,00:42:56.80,00:42:56.80,"   Well, the weather    has spoken"
908,00:42:59.50,00:42:59.50,   and the tribe    has spoken.
909,00:43:01.33,00:43:01.33, Okay.
910,00:43:02.87,00:43:02.87,It's time for you to go.
911,00:43:04.23,00:43:04.23,This way?
912,00:43:04.23,00:43:04.23,Yeah.
913,00:43:05.67,00:43:05.67,  All right.
914,00:43:05.67,00:43:05.67,  Good-bye.
915,00:43:10.27,00:43:10.27,"As for you guys,"
916,00:43:12.03,00:43:12.03,   I don't want to send    you back out in that.
917,00:43:14.10,00:43:14.10," You're welcome  to stay here tonight,"
918,00:43:16.13,00:43:16.13,  or until it stops raining...
919,00:43:17.70,00:43:17.70,"   as dry as you can,"
920,00:43:19.63,00:43:19.63," and, uh, I'll see you at some point tomorrow."
921,00:43:22.93,00:43:22.93,  ( thunder rumbling )
922,00:43:26.77,00:43:26.77, ( singing in native language )
923,00:43:42.97,00:43:42.97, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
924,00:43:46.83,00:43:46.83, Next week on Survivor:
925,00:43:48.83,00:43:48.83, Last night was the worst night I've ever slept.
926,00:43:53.20,00:43:53.20, I don't want to sleep     in that anymore.
927,00:43:54.57,00:43:54.57,I'm going in the woods.
928,00:43:55.60,00:43:55.60,   I had this vision.
929,00:43:56.87,00:43:56.87,  I thought I'd build myself a bowling alley.
930,00:43:58.37,00:43:58.37,We don't need a bowling alley.
931,00:43:59.63,00:43:59.63,RICHARD:   I know what the resolution
932,00:44:01.53,00:44:01.53," to the conflict would be,  but I'm planning something  different"
933,00:44:04.93,00:44:04.93,   and it's a little sneaky.
934,00:44:06.83,00:44:06.83,  Captioning sponsored by CBS and SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
935,00:44:10.87,00:44:10.87,  Captioned by    Media Access Group at WGBH access.wgbh.org
936,00:44:13.03,00:44:13.03,They kicked off  their bug-eating hero
937,00:44:14.83,00:44:14.83,  instead of their   food-stealing
938,00:44:17.20,00:44:17.20,"  stumbling,   ornery old Navy Seal."
939,00:44:20.67,00:44:20.67," Probably the guys said, ""Well,    we need to vote a woman off"
940,00:44:23.93,00:44:23.93," ""'cause we need    physical strength,"
941,00:44:25.73,00:44:25.73," and, you know, who do we think     is the least productive?"""
942,00:44:28.17,00:44:28.17, And that would be me.
943,00:44:29.67,00:44:29.67,And yet I was much more  productive than the four guys.
