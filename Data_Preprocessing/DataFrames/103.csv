1,00:00:02.13,00:00:02.13,  JEFF PROBST:  16 Americans forced to abandon ship
2,00:00:04.53,00:00:04.53, in the middle of the South China Sea.
3,00:00:08.23,00:00:08.23, Marooned for 39 days
4,00:00:11.37,00:00:11.37," they must work together    to build shelter,"
5,00:00:13.83,00:00:13.83,  find food and survive the island.
6,00:00:16.40,00:00:16.40," But ultimately, it is    everyone for themselves."
7,00:00:20.23,00:00:20.23," Every third night, they will    hike deep into the jungle"
8,00:00:23.30,00:00:23.30, to take part  in the Tribal Council
9,00:00:25.30,00:00:25.30,  where they must vote one  of their own off the island.
10,00:00:29.33,00:00:29.33,"In the end, only one will remain"
11,00:00:31.33,00:00:31.33,  and will leave the island
12,00:00:33.00,00:00:33.00,  with $1 million in cash.
13,00:00:38.60,00:00:38.60,  Last week on Survivor...
14,00:00:41.03,00:00:41.03,  B.B's anger  with the Pagong Tribe
15,00:00:43.07,00:00:43.07,  reached a fevered pitch.
16,00:00:44.60,00:00:44.60,I've been workingmy ass off.
17,00:00:46.17,00:00:46.17, A lot of you have been laying on your ass watching me.
18,00:00:47.83,00:00:47.83, Put the carrying log--   we're right in...
19,00:00:48.87,00:00:48.87,all the way over now.
20,00:00:50.20,00:00:50.20,"If we're building a health gym,I'll let you do it."
21,00:00:53.10,00:00:53.10,   Damn it. Walk   straight in.
22,00:00:55.03,00:00:55.03,"   It may not be that right,   but how many times we got"
23,00:00:56.83,00:00:56.83,to make those decisions?
24,00:00:58.03,00:00:58.03," JEFF: At Tagi, the conflict"
25,00:00:59.83,00:00:59.83, between Stacey and Rudy    deepened.
26,00:01:02.30,00:01:02.30, RUDY: Me and her wouldn't get along.
27,00:01:04.07,00:01:04.07,  If we were friends on the outside
28,00:01:05.60,00:01:05.60,   I'd definitely avoid her.
29,00:01:07.33,00:01:07.33,"STACEY:  We've all seen him   eating extra food,"
30,00:01:09.07,00:01:09.07, and he's just sort of   a liability to us.
31,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50, He was sitting around barking orders
32,00:01:12.27,00:01:12.27,and not really helping out much.
33,00:01:13.80,00:01:13.80," RUDY: She's too prim-like, you know."
34,00:01:15.07,00:01:15.07,"  I mean, uh,"
35,00:01:16.87,00:01:16.87,after about three weeksout here in this jungle
36,00:01:19.00,00:01:19.00," she's going to learn a lesson,I think."
37,00:01:21.00,00:01:21.00, JEFF:  And Richard shared openly  with his tribe mates.
38,00:01:24.03,00:01:24.03,"  There is a lifestyle   associated with being gay,"
39,00:01:26.40,00:01:26.40,   but you can't say  I decided to be gay.
40,00:01:28.60,00:01:28.60," RUDY:  The homosexual, he's one of the nicest guys I ever met."
41,00:01:32.57,00:01:32.57,  Me and Richard got to be  pretty good friends--
42,00:01:35.57,00:01:35.57,"not in a homosexual way,that's for sure."
43,00:01:38.17,00:01:38.17," JEFF:  At the immunity challenge,  Stacey pulled through"
44,00:01:40.70,00:01:40.70,  by winningthe final unappetizing round...
45,00:01:43.70,00:01:43.70,SEAN:Swallow!
46,00:01:45.43,00:01:45.43,Open!
47,00:01:45.43,00:01:45.43,JEFF:Tagi!
48,00:01:48.03,00:01:48.03,  ...forcing Pagong  to take the long hike
49,00:01:50.23,00:01:50.23, to the Tribal Council
50,00:01:51.93,00:01:51.93, where B.B.'S  volatile personality
51,00:01:53.83,00:01:53.83,  finally caught up with him.
52,00:01:55.83,00:01:55.83,"  ""B.B."""
53,00:01:57.23,00:01:57.23," B.B., the tribe has spoken."
54,00:02:00.63,00:02:00.63,  It's time  for you to go.
55,00:02:02.30,00:02:02.30,   All right.
56,00:02:03.33,00:02:03.33, JEFF: 14 Are left.
57,00:02:04.60,00:02:04.60,"  Tonight, one more will go."

59,00:03:18.07,00:03:18.07, KELLY:   I keep forgetting where I am...
60,00:03:20.13,00:03:20.13,when I wake up.
61,00:03:23.57,00:03:23.57,   The plan now is to go out
62,00:03:24.87,00:03:24.87, and try to do  some early morning fishing.
63,00:03:32.07,00:03:32.07, SEAN: Fishing is horrible.
64,00:03:33.90,00:03:33.90," That saying, ""There's   a lot of fish in the sea""?"
65,00:03:35.83,00:03:35.83, Not this sea.
66,00:03:37.23,00:03:37.23," They apparently didn't grow up in Palua Tiga,"
67,00:03:39.47,00:03:39.47,"  uh, because there is nothingto be caught out there."
68,00:03:42.27,00:03:42.27," SUSAN:  As far as    the food holding up, uh,"
69,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,   I don't... I think we're into day seven.
70,00:03:48.20,00:03:48.20,"I lost track, but I know it's starting to whittle down."
71,00:03:51.50,00:03:51.50,   I know we got to get fishin here.
72,00:03:53.07,00:03:53.07,  ( conch shell being blown )
73,00:03:54.97,00:03:54.97, SUSAN:   You want to check   the one on the left first?
74,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,KELLY AND STACEY:Yeah.
75,00:03:56.53,00:03:56.53,We're going by that first.
76,00:03:58.70,00:03:58.70," KELLY:Come on,   fish in the trap."
77,00:04:00.53,00:04:00.53,Rocks do not want to takeher down on that one end.
78,00:04:03.83,00:04:03.83,Okay.
79,00:04:09.03,00:04:09.03,Nothing.
80,00:04:10.30,00:04:10.30,Bait's all gone.
81,00:04:12.67,00:04:12.67, KELLY: This is frustrating.
82,00:04:14.53,00:04:14.53,"I mean, it's the ocean."
83,00:04:16.53,00:04:16.53,"   You think you'd get a fish  somehow, but no luck so far."
84,00:04:20.80,00:04:20.80,"  We all thought, ""Oh, yeah,  you know, we got these traps,"
85,00:04:23.73,00:04:23.73," we got hooks, we got a raft."""
86,00:04:25.50,00:04:25.50,"  You know, there's no reason   why we shouldn't be having"
87,00:04:28.07,00:04:28.07,"  big, fat fish for dinner  every night,"
88,00:04:29.80,00:04:29.80,  but we're just not.
89,00:04:30.87,00:04:30.87,"   To me, that's kind of like"
90,00:04:32.90,00:04:32.90,"  uh, yeah, whoo-hoo,big survivors, you know?"
91,00:04:35.93,00:04:35.93,When was the last timeRudy went on a water run?
92,00:04:38.23,00:04:38.23,"   He never did, did he?"
93,00:04:39.57,00:04:39.57,I don't thinkhe's been
94,00:04:40.57,00:04:40.57, on a water run.
95,00:04:41.70,00:04:41.70,  He's sneaky.
96,00:04:43.03,00:04:43.03,He is.He's sneaky.
97,00:04:44.70,00:04:44.70,  He swipes food
98,00:04:46.30,00:04:46.30,while he's in therecooking in the kitchen.
99,00:04:48.67,00:04:48.67,STACEY:  I think we've all sort of come to the conclusion
100,00:04:51.30,00:04:51.30, that Rudy really needs   to get out of here.
101,00:04:53.23,00:04:53.23,   He just criticizes whatever we're doing.
102,00:04:54.80,00:04:54.80,  He's hurting morale.
103,00:04:56.30,00:04:56.30,  We row out yesterday morning   and set the traps.
104,00:04:58.60,00:04:58.60,I come into the kitchen.
105,00:04:59.93,00:04:59.93,"""Morning, Rudy,  how are you doing?"""
106,00:05:01.87,00:05:01.87,"   ""You're wasting your time   out there."
107,00:05:03.43,00:05:03.43,"  It's just a waste."""
108,00:05:05.23,00:05:05.23,"  I was, like, ""Damn, morning to you, too."" What the hell."
109,00:05:06.63,00:05:06.63,"SUSAN:Well, he's wasting his timeby doing nothing, though."
110,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67," KELLY:  I think we were all kind of stoked that, you know,"
111,00:05:11.83,00:05:11.83,"  yeah, he's an ex-Navy Seal,"
112,00:05:13.27,00:05:13.27,  We're going to kick ass.
113,00:05:14.63,00:05:14.63, But he really hasn't contributed very much.
114,00:05:16.77,00:05:16.77,I think it's definitely going to influence me
115,00:05:18.57,00:05:18.57,   the next time I go   to Tribal Council.
116,00:05:20.90,00:05:20.90,"I think it's influencing  all of us, you know."
117,00:05:25.37,00:05:25.37," When it comes down, you know,"
118,00:05:27.47,00:05:27.47,"  to-to voting people   that we do like off, I..."
119,00:05:30.23,00:05:30.23,"it's sucky, but I thinkit's going to come down"
120,00:05:33.43,00:05:33.43,  to whoever screws up   at the challenges.
121,00:05:36.03,00:05:36.03,"  SUSAN:  Yeah, 'cause I already  know who I'd vote for."
122,00:05:38.83,00:05:38.83,The person that's least  contributing to the group...
123,00:05:41.93,00:05:41.93,  out of here.
124,00:05:44.07,00:05:44.07,  I have conflicts--  personality conflicts
125,00:05:45.90,00:05:45.90, every day with people.
126,00:05:47.40,00:05:47.40," I deal with them, I work withthem, I live with them, I go on."
127,00:05:49.23,00:05:49.23,I'm going to do  the same thing here:
128,00:05:50.67,00:05:50.67,  I'm going to get rid
129,00:05:51.97,00:05:51.97, of the weakest member and vote Stacey out.
130,00:05:53.40,00:05:53.40,  Stacey's trying to buddy up with everybody
131,00:05:57.40,00:05:57.40,  because she knows   she's the weakest.
132,00:05:59.20,00:05:59.20,"STACEY: When Kelly, Sue and I    were on the raft"
133,00:06:01.23,00:06:01.23, we talked about   who we'd vote off.
134,00:06:02.90,00:06:02.90,"   Sue initially didn't want   to talk about it,"
135,00:06:05.13,00:06:05.13, which immediately clued me in
136,00:06:06.67,00:06:06.67," that she was planning to vote me off,"
137,00:06:08.63,00:06:08.63, even though we decided   to stick together.
138,00:06:10.27,00:06:10.27,"So now I don't trust her   as far as I can throw her,"
139,00:06:12.20,00:06:12.20," which, according to the group,   would be not far."
140,00:06:14.10,00:06:14.10,   Did you catch   anything?
141,00:06:16.63,00:06:16.63,SUSAN:No fish.
142,00:06:17.73,00:06:17.73,We set thetraps up though.
143,00:06:20.07,00:06:20.07,Set the fish traps?
144,00:06:21.17,00:06:21.17,That's it?
145,00:06:22.30,00:06:22.30,"  Just... yeah, no fish."
146,00:06:23.47,00:06:23.47, We didn't fish but 20 minutes.
147,00:06:32.10,00:06:32.10,COLLEEN:  The oomph is a little gone from our group.
148,00:06:35.00,00:06:35.00,  I don't know why that is.
149,00:06:36.60,00:06:36.60,I think that not eatingis a factor of our mood.
150,00:06:39.07,00:06:39.07, We want food.
151,00:06:40.70,00:06:40.70,"  Gretchen, Colleen and Greg,"
152,00:06:42.60,00:06:42.60, they were out looking   for tapioca
153,00:06:44.70,00:06:44.70, so that we could have
154,00:06:46.13,00:06:46.13,  mashed-potato style  tapioca root.
155,00:06:47.67,00:06:47.67,"It's tapioca, for sure."
156,00:06:49.40,00:06:49.40,   ( all chuckling )
157,00:06:50.87,00:06:50.87,"Just take a bite,and see what..."
158,00:06:52.87,00:06:52.87,No. Maybe it's just tapiocarun wild.
159,00:06:55.20,00:06:55.20, ( chuckling )
160,00:06:56.73,00:06:56.73,"Operation Tapioca has everything  to do with finding tapioca,"
161,00:07:00.37,00:07:00.37,"but we find other thingson the way, too."
162,00:07:02.83,00:07:02.83,COLLEEN:  The first time I came upon the mud volcano
163,00:07:06.93,00:07:06.93,  was with Gretchen and Greg.
164,00:07:08.53,00:07:08.53,"Oh, wow!"
165,00:07:10.93,00:07:10.93,   Look at this. Oh!
166,00:07:12.43,00:07:12.43, Is it blooping?
167,00:07:12.43,00:07:12.43,  Did you see that?
168,00:07:15.77,00:07:15.77,Oh! Oh...
169,00:07:17.63,00:07:17.63,   GRETCHEN:  We stoppedat the mud volcanoes for a dip.
170,00:07:21.60,00:07:21.60,  We had a good time.
171,00:07:31.03,00:07:31.03,  ( laughing )
172,00:07:39.07,00:07:39.07,COLLEEN:  We walked out of the woods
173,00:07:41.30,00:07:41.30," like, you know,    Lord of the Flies,"
174,00:07:42.63,00:07:42.63,"  and, uh, I think the others"
175,00:07:44.20,00:07:44.20, were quite interested    in our discovery
176,00:07:46.50,00:07:46.50, so we took a group field trip.
177,00:07:47.80,00:07:47.80,What is wrongwith you people?
178,00:07:50.33,00:07:50.33," Oh, my God!"
179,00:07:58.47,00:07:58.47,GERVASE: It was a great feeling.
180,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97, It's just like a nice little   celebration for everybody.
181,00:08:02.50,00:08:02.50,"   You get together,just get dirty,"
182,00:08:05.57,00:08:05.57,  and have a little fun--    have a couple of laughs.
183,00:08:08.17,00:08:08.17,COLLEEN:Whose leg is...?
184,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,Now we really don'twant to be voted off.
185,00:08:13.50,00:08:13.50, JENNA: But it's also just to get away   from the daily grind here.
186,00:08:16.93,00:08:16.93," I mean, we're going to be here39 days."
187,00:08:18.27,00:08:18.27,You got to keep yourself happy.
188,00:08:45.63,00:08:45.63, RUDY:  I seen Dirk    reading his bible today.
189,00:08:48.97,00:08:48.97, I didn't know  he brought a bible.
190,00:08:51.20,00:08:51.20," ""For out of the heart  come evil thoughts:"
191,00:08:53.23,00:08:53.23,"   ""Murder, adultery,"
192,00:08:55.20,00:08:55.20,"   sexual immorality, theft,   false testimony, slander."""
193,00:08:58.60,00:08:58.60," DIRK: I just need that quiet time,"
194,00:09:01.40,00:09:01.40, and especiallya lot of that quiet time
195,00:09:03.80,00:09:03.80, includes just praying and meditating
196,00:09:05.83,00:09:05.83,  and praising God.
197,00:09:07.40,00:09:07.40,  That's kind of where I feel   all my strength and energy
198,00:09:10.00,00:09:10.00,  comes from.
199,00:09:11.50,00:09:11.50," My testimony is not something  I'm afraid to share,"
200,00:09:14.67,00:09:14.67,  and that's just part   of getting to know people
201,00:09:17.00,00:09:17.00,and at a deeper   and deeper level.
202,00:09:18.70,00:09:18.70,"   See, the Ten Commandments  was an old covenant"
203,00:09:21.30,00:09:21.30,that the Hebrews...that God's chosen nation--
204,00:09:23.27,00:09:23.27,"the Israelites,"
205,00:09:25.13,00:09:25.13,"the Hebrews--had signed with him,"
206,00:09:27.67,00:09:27.67," but when Christ came,"
207,00:09:29.20,00:09:29.20,   he opened the door to every human being on Earth.
208,00:09:31.27,00:09:31.27, SUSAN: I can only take   so much preaching.
209,00:09:33.97,00:09:33.97,"   I went to church,   I put my time in."
210,00:09:36.37,00:09:36.37," I believe in God and all that,   but to constantly"
211,00:09:38.40,00:09:38.40,"  everything always come backon to ""Jesus, Jesus""..."
212,00:09:40.83,00:09:40.83,"   yeah, Dirk's about   driving me wild with that."
213,00:09:48.33,00:09:48.33,   It's getting even prettier and prettier.
214,00:09:51.53,00:09:51.53,"Well, thank you."
215,00:09:53.40,00:09:53.40,STACEY:  I think Dirk has    a little crush on Kelly.
216,00:09:55.80,00:09:55.80,He doesn't have   a chance in hell.
217,00:09:57.90,00:09:57.90," Stacey came up to me, ""Yeah, I think he likes you."""
218,00:10:00.53,00:10:00.53," I was just, like, ""oh, great,""   you know?"
219,00:10:02.50,00:10:02.50,"  I-I didn't come out here   for that, you know?"
220,00:10:04.90,00:10:04.90,  We don't need that.
221,00:10:06.53,00:10:06.53," DIRK:  Kelly's got  a serious boyfriend,"
222,00:10:09.43,00:10:09.43,"and unless she tells me   otherwise,"
223,00:10:10.77,00:10:10.77, that's a lineI'm not going to cross.
224,00:10:12.30,00:10:12.30,I love you.
225,00:10:14.70,00:10:14.70,  But we're-- it's a platonic type of love.
226,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,  I think he's really  sexually frustrated.
227,00:10:19.97,00:10:19.97,  I've gone 23 years  without sex.
228,00:10:21.20,00:10:21.20, I think you guys can go seven weeks.
229,00:10:22.67,00:10:22.67,SUSAN:I went a year one time.
230,00:10:23.93,00:10:23.93,"Oh, my God!"
231,00:10:25.00,00:10:25.00,SUSAN:You shouldtry it sometime.
232,00:10:26.60,00:10:26.60,You might like it.
233,00:10:28.03,00:10:28.03," It's just funny, but..."
234,00:10:29.13,00:10:29.13,I knowyou'll like it.
235,00:10:30.57,00:10:30.57,"   No, I know I'm   going to love it."
236,00:10:31.63,00:10:31.63,You'll come back.You'll come back.
237,00:10:33.00,00:10:33.00,   It's a gift from God.
238,00:10:34.07,00:10:34.07,"  There's no doubt, man."
239,00:10:35.20,00:10:35.20,"  I'm obviously not a virgin,"
240,00:10:36.70,00:10:36.70,"but if he, uh..."
241,00:10:38.20,00:10:38.20,"  that's how he wants to live his life, that's cool."
242,00:10:40.37,00:10:40.37, You don't meet too many  23-old guys who are virgins.
243,00:10:43.57,00:10:43.57,"   He's interesting,  being a virgin, 23,"
244,00:10:45.53,00:10:45.53," and not, uh, thinking"
245,00:10:47.13,00:10:47.13,  about crossing that line  till marriage-- hoo!
246,00:10:49.83,00:10:49.83,"He's extraordinarily religious,"
247,00:10:51.37,00:10:51.37,  and I don't know that we'd ever be real close
248,00:10:53.50,00:10:53.50, because we're on such
249,00:10:54.93,00:10:54.93, different ends  of the spectrum religiously.
250,00:10:56.93,00:10:56.93," DIRK:  Rich, you know... homosexual people tend to talk"
251,00:11:00.43,00:11:00.43,   about their homosexuality
252,00:11:01.90,00:11:01.90," all the time,and it's really annoying to me."
253,00:11:03.73,00:11:03.73,It's seems likeyou talk about sex an awful lot.
254,00:11:06.10,00:11:06.10,   Nobody's going to tell me what not to do
255,00:11:07.90,00:11:07.90,   or what not to talk about.
256,00:11:09.50,00:11:09.50,   If it's offensive   to anybody
257,00:11:11.40,00:11:11.40,  I stop immediately.
258,00:11:13.77,00:11:13.77," DIRK: Maybe that's just me,  but if he could cut that out"
259,00:11:16.30,00:11:16.30, it'd almost be perfect  around camp.
260,00:11:25.43,00:11:25.43,Day seven on the island.
261,00:11:27.87,00:11:27.87,  After Pagong's visit   to Tribal Council
262,00:11:29.67,00:11:29.67,both tribes are now even   at seven members.
263,00:11:32.33,00:11:32.33,  Today we'll see what effect   losing B.B. has on Pagong
264,00:11:34.93,00:11:34.93,as they prepare   for their next challenge.
265,00:11:37.70,00:11:37.70,"Both tribes will have their workcut out for them today,"
266,00:11:40.30,00:11:40.30,"as it requires strength,   endurance,"
267,00:11:43.23,00:11:43.23,"and most importantly, teamwork."
268,00:11:45.90,00:11:45.90,  Try to go this one alone...
269,00:11:47.40,00:11:47.40, you'll never make it to shore.
270,00:12:01.07,00:12:01.07,  Yes!
271,00:12:03.03,00:12:03.03,It's underwater.
272,00:12:09.43,00:12:09.43,"""Lucky for you there'snot much to do"
273,00:12:12.30,00:12:12.30,"""to prepare for   the next big race."
274,00:12:15.13,00:12:15.13,"  ""Just hold on tight,   use all your might"
275,00:12:16.87,00:12:16.87,"   and stay down till   you're blue in the face."""
276,00:12:18.73,00:12:18.73,"Oh, we're goingto go diving."
277,00:12:20.33,00:12:20.33,   Hold your breath.
278,00:12:21.77,00:12:21.77,"   ""Gasping for air, weight you can't bear,"
279,00:12:23.33,00:12:23.33,"  ""before you're done you may quit,"
280,00:12:25.13,00:12:25.13,"  ""the fish you desire  are yours to acquire"
281,00:12:27.50,00:12:27.50,"  if you're the first  to the sand spit."""
282,00:12:30.33,00:12:30.33,"Yeah, though, it's gotto be underwater,"
283,00:12:32.40,00:12:32.40,"holding your breath,"
284,00:12:33.53,00:12:33.53,getting somethingand getting somewhere.
285,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20,Okay.
286,00:12:36.20,00:12:36.20,"Come on, Seal."
287,00:12:37.47,00:12:37.47,Who could do that?
288,00:12:39.17,00:12:39.17,"Well, that's what it is."
289,00:12:40.43,00:12:40.43, You know you're diving for something.
290,00:12:48.17,00:12:48.17," Something underwater, I'm thinking."
291,00:12:50.43,00:12:50.43,   Yeah.
292,00:12:52.33,00:12:52.33,It's underwater today.
293,00:12:53.63,00:12:53.63,Cool.
294,00:12:54.97,00:12:54.97,Either lifting somethingfrom the bottom
295,00:12:56.67,00:12:56.67,"  or carrying it  underwater,"
296,00:12:58.00,00:12:58.00,   or a distant swim   underwater
297,00:12:59.07,00:12:59.07,   or something.
298,00:13:00.47,00:13:00.47,GERVASE:  The thing is this:
299,00:13:02.07,00:13:02.07,  everybody knew coming in    water wasn't my thing--
300,00:13:04.13,00:13:04.13,"  swimming wasn't my thing,   and my team"
301,00:13:06.00,00:13:06.00,"  knew it from the beginning,"
302,00:13:07.50,00:13:07.50," so when we get into any kind of swimming situation,"
303,00:13:09.60,00:13:09.60,"if it's actual swimming, we're going to be struggling."
304,00:13:12.23,00:13:12.23,"  You know, they have to compensate for me."
305,00:13:13.90,00:13:13.90,  But that's what a team does.
306,00:13:49.83,00:13:49.83,"  JEFF:  Hey, guys."
307,00:13:51.90,00:13:51.90,  ALL:  Hey!
308,00:13:54.30,00:13:54.30,"   Tagi, you, you saw   they're missing a member."
309,00:13:55.90,00:13:55.90, B.B. got voted off last night.
310,00:13:59.17,00:13:59.17,   Today's challenge is a reward challenge.
311,00:14:01.07,00:14:01.07,  You won't be playing  for immunity today.
312,00:14:03.03,00:14:03.03, That'll happen later.
313,00:14:04.97,00:14:04.97,   Today's challenge strictly  for a reward
314,00:14:07.00,00:14:07.00, that includes a fishing spear.
315,00:14:09.50,00:14:09.50,   Here's the game...
316,00:14:10.50,00:14:10.50,   it is a team game.
317,00:14:11.80,00:14:11.80,   Big emphasis on the tribe.
318,00:14:13.53,00:14:13.53,   What you're going to do isyou're going to swim out
319,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,   to the inner tubes   out in the water.
320,00:14:17.50,00:14:17.50, Directly below the inner tube on either side
321,00:14:20.60,00:14:20.60,  is a sunken treasure chest.
322,00:14:21.93,00:14:21.93,  Get that chest back here
323,00:14:23.70,00:14:23.70,  up on your platform.
324,00:14:25.10,00:14:25.10,The game is over when one tribe  has their chest here
325,00:14:28.67,00:14:28.67,and every memberhas a hand on the chest.
326,00:14:30.77,00:14:30.77,The only rule is
327,00:14:32.37,00:14:32.37,  you can't dive downto get the chest
328,00:14:34.53,00:14:34.53,  until everybody is out there with a hand on the inner tube.
329,00:14:37.10,00:14:37.10,So the race really starts here.
330,00:14:38.60,00:14:38.60, The quicker everybody gets out there
331,00:14:40.10,00:14:40.10, the quicker you can dive down and start to move it.
332,00:14:42.37,00:14:42.37,  Anything not clear?
333,00:14:43.93,00:14:43.93,  No?
334,00:14:45.27,00:14:45.27,"   Survivors, ready?"
335,00:14:46.27,00:14:46.27,Ready.
336,00:14:47.57,00:14:47.57,  Go!
337,00:15:14.00,00:15:14.00,Go! Here we go!
338,00:15:15.60,00:15:15.60,We're going down.
339,00:15:31.80,00:15:31.80,   I think you're...
340,00:15:32.83,00:15:32.83,I can't getahold of it.
341,00:15:35.83,00:15:35.83,Everybody...
342,00:15:38.23,00:15:38.23,  Get your hand up.
343,00:16:05.17,00:16:05.17, ( indistinct chatter )
344,00:16:19.20,00:16:19.20, ( indistinct chatter )
345,00:16:22.83,00:16:22.83,( all talking at once )
346,00:16:47.73,00:16:47.73,"...two, three."
347,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,   You okay?
348,00:16:49.90,00:16:49.90,Yeah.
349,00:17:05.37,00:17:05.37,( all talking )
350,00:17:12.50,00:17:12.50,Got it?
351,00:17:13.53,00:17:13.53,   I got it.
352,00:17:14.57,00:17:14.57,Come on! Come on!
353,00:17:15.90,00:17:15.90," Stay with us, here..."
354,00:17:25.37,00:17:25.37,"Hell, yeah."
355,00:17:26.43,00:17:26.43,"Our beach now, baby."
356,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,Our beach now.
357,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,"That's right, baby."
358,00:17:28.93,00:17:28.93,  ( shouting )
359,00:17:30.27,00:17:30.27, Put your hands on it! Put your hands on it!
360,00:17:33.17,00:17:33.17, Tagi!
361,00:17:34.67,00:17:34.67,Yeah!
362,00:17:34.67,00:17:34.67,  Whoo!
363,00:17:35.70,00:17:35.70,  Way to go.
364,00:17:36.93,00:17:36.93,"  Bring it in, guys,  bring it in."
365,00:17:38.07,00:17:38.07,Nice job.
366,00:17:39.17,00:17:39.17," Man, way to get it done, Rudy."
367,00:17:41.03,00:17:41.03,  ...than I imagined  it would be.
368,00:17:42.23,00:17:42.23,"By the time you getout, you're so..."
369,00:17:43.93,00:17:43.93,"Good work, guys."
370,00:17:45.53,00:17:45.53," JEFF:  All right, here's the deal."
371,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,"  The key, Mr. Hatch, if you'd like,"
372,00:17:48.97,00:17:48.97,  to grab right there.
373,00:17:50.10,00:17:50.10,"Yeah, Rich,go get it, baby."
374,00:17:51.57,00:17:51.57,"  Go, Richard."
375,00:17:51.57,00:17:51.57,  Underneath.
376,00:17:54.07,00:17:54.07, ( indistinct chatter )
377,00:17:59.80,00:17:59.80,   ( tribe cheering )
378,00:18:01.97,00:18:01.97, Look at all that booty!
379,00:18:03.47,00:18:03.47,"Oh, money, money."
380,00:18:11.67,00:18:11.67,   See you tomorrow.
381,00:18:21.53,00:18:21.53,( tribal yell )
382,00:18:28.60,00:18:28.60,RICHARD: Yesterday's competition   was great.
383,00:18:30.47,00:18:30.47,"   That was the, uh, pullingthe treasure up from the water,"
384,00:18:33.10,00:18:33.10,   dragging it in and getting  a mask and snorkel.
385,00:18:35.20,00:18:35.20," Oh, baby, that made me   feel good."
386,00:18:36.70,00:18:36.70, I wanted that mask and snorkel from day one...
387,00:18:39.50,00:18:39.50," to go get, uh, fish."
388,00:18:58.50,00:18:58.50," SEAN: Rich, he overestimates himself   sometimes,"
389,00:19:01.27,00:19:01.27,  and we were kind of thinking
390,00:19:02.80,00:19:02.80,  that he wasn't going   to catch anything.
391,00:19:03.80,00:19:03.80," When you snorkel down there,"
392,00:19:06.03,00:19:06.03,  there's nothing    to even stab at.
393,00:19:09.90,00:19:09.90,  We have a good pole.
394,00:19:10.93,00:19:10.93,  I have my Superpole.
395,00:19:12.60,00:19:12.60,"Uh, which is, you know,   it works--"
396,00:19:14.40,00:19:14.40, in a Gilligan's Island  sort of sense.
397,00:19:16.03,00:19:16.03,"  We got some maggots,"
398,00:19:17.63,00:19:17.63,   we got the Superpole 2000
399,00:19:19.40,00:19:19.40,   and we got the persistenceof Dirk and me.
400,00:19:21.80,00:19:21.80, We can't lose.
401,00:19:26.47,00:19:26.47," Feeling good today, buddy."
402,00:19:30.77,00:19:30.77,  We got to come back  with fish tonight.
403,00:19:33.60,00:19:33.60,If somebody gets a fish   on a spear
404,00:19:35.03,00:19:35.03,  I'll be seriously impressed.
405,00:19:36.40,00:19:36.40,So will I. Let's seeif he can do it.
406,00:19:38.40,00:19:38.40," Well, Rich is confident, man.I appreciate..."
407,00:19:40.17,00:19:40.17,"If I was a littlefish and saw Rich swimming out,"
408,00:19:41.70,00:19:41.70,I wouldn't besticking around long.
409,00:19:43.27,00:19:43.27,Big gay manwith a spearcoming right at me.
410,00:20:14.27,00:20:14.27," Oh, it's a ray."
411,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,   I don't know if   it's an angel ray
412,00:20:17.03,00:20:17.03, or a sting ray.
413,00:20:18.87,00:20:18.87,"RICHARD: This is a good moment for me,  'cause I knew people"
414,00:20:20.73,00:20:20.73, were thinkingI was just full of caca.
415,00:20:23.17,00:20:23.17,   And it was just...
416,00:20:24.20,00:20:24.20," you know, one of those things"
417,00:20:25.73,00:20:25.73," that I've been talking about fishing,"
418,00:20:27.50,00:20:27.50, talking about what I've    been doing all my life...
419,00:20:30.07,00:20:30.07,  We're supposed  to eat that thing?
420,00:20:31.40,00:20:31.40,I will.
421,00:20:32.60,00:20:32.60,Just to make note
422,00:20:33.93,00:20:33.93,who got the first fish.
423,00:20:35.23,00:20:35.23,It's not a fish;it's a ray.
424,00:20:37.07,00:20:37.07,Oh! Oh!You suck.
425,00:20:38.20,00:20:38.20,I'm coming backin a second
426,00:20:40.20,00:20:40.20,  with a fish.
427,00:20:41.67,00:20:41.67, I actually think Sean was kind of sad
428,00:20:44.13,00:20:44.13,that I beat him.
429,00:21:01.13,00:21:01.13,   All right.
430,00:21:14.73,00:21:14.73,"Another ray, huh?"
431,00:21:15.97,00:21:15.97,Now you got two.
432,00:21:17.27,00:21:17.27,Do we want another ray?
433,00:21:19.10,00:21:19.10, We don't know   if they taste good
434,00:21:20.17,00:21:20.17, or if they're edible.
435,00:21:21.63,00:21:21.63,"   Sean said, ""Get somethingthat looks like a fish."""
436,00:21:23.57,00:21:23.57,This is a fish.
437,00:21:24.93,00:21:24.93," Look at that,  doesn't that look delicious?"
438,00:21:26.60,00:21:26.60,   No more rays.
439,00:21:28.47,00:21:28.47,   Catch a fish.
440,00:21:30.23,00:21:30.23,"If I see a fish,I'll get a fish."
441,00:21:31.77,00:21:31.77,"   But if I get rays, I'm going to get rays."
442,00:21:33.30,00:21:33.30,There are seven people to feed.
443,00:21:34.70,00:21:34.70,I don't knowif they taste good.
444,00:21:36.20,00:21:36.20,I'm not sure I'mfollowing the logic.
445,00:21:37.87,00:21:37.87,"I mean, you're sitting herefishing..."
446,00:21:37.87,00:21:37.87,   Right.
447,00:21:39.63,00:21:39.63,For what?
448,00:21:40.93,00:21:40.93,I see a fish or somethingthat looks like a fish--
449,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,"   I mean, I'll eat whatever."
450,00:21:45.20,00:21:45.20,"Finally, when I came upwith a third one"
451,00:21:46.67,00:21:46.67,"  they said,  ""Good job, good job."""
452,00:21:47.77,00:21:47.77,  Good work.
453,00:21:49.53,00:21:49.53, SEAN:  He pulled through.   He showed his true colors.
454,00:21:50.67,00:21:50.67,He does know how to spear fish.
455,00:21:52.50,00:21:52.50," He got us a couple of,"
456,00:21:54.07,00:21:54.07,"   uh, manta rays or whatever  the hell they were."
457,00:21:55.90,00:21:55.90,  We got fish.
458,00:21:57.00,00:21:57.00,No way! No way!
459,00:21:59.50,00:21:59.50,  ( screams )
460,00:22:00.60,00:22:00.60,Watch the spear.
461,00:22:02.50,00:22:02.50,"   Hey, baby."
462,00:22:03.57,00:22:03.57," Oh, hell, yeah."
463,00:22:04.67,00:22:04.67,We're eating dinner.
464,00:22:05.80,00:22:05.80,RICHARD: My position with the tribe--
465,00:22:08.10,00:22:08.10,it's probably going to increase  as a result of this.
466,00:22:10.40,00:22:10.40, I talk about the things    that I'm capable of doing
467,00:22:13.97,00:22:13.97, and this might give them that
468,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97," ""Oh, maybe some of what  he's saying is true."""
469,00:22:21.27,00:22:21.27,"They're, uh, pretty,"
470,00:22:22.73,00:22:22.73,  pretty damn tasty.  I recommend
471,00:22:24.57,00:22:24.57,  keep catching those...  they appear to be
472,00:22:26.27,00:22:26.27,"   slow, slow, slow."
473,00:22:27.73,00:22:27.73, Or you know how to catch them.
474,00:22:29.33,00:22:29.33,  RICHARD:  Thank you.
475,00:22:30.33,00:22:30.33, You need to keep me
476,00:22:31.70,00:22:31.70, and I'll provide you with the fish you need.
477,00:22:33.17,00:22:33.17,SEAN:I don't what I'd do withoutthe gay perspective anyway.
478,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,  ( laughs )
479,00:23:04.40,00:23:04.40, I don't see it at all.
480,00:23:08.20,00:23:08.20,We heard a rumor  that the other team
481,00:23:09.80,00:23:09.80,caught a fish with their spear.
482,00:23:11.87,00:23:11.87,   The mask--  that was definitely the key
483,00:23:13.73,00:23:13.73, to them starting to get fish.
484,00:23:17.80,00:23:17.80, And that does worry me  a little bit
485,00:23:19.30,00:23:19.30,   'cause they're going to be  eating some protein.
486,00:23:20.90,00:23:20.90,"   I would definitely rather   have fish than rat, but..."
487,00:23:24.20,00:23:24.20,now it doesn't matter-- either/or now.
488,00:23:28.07,00:23:28.07," JENNA: Ho, I'm so ready to eat rat."
489,00:23:30.27,00:23:30.27,"  I want to gut 'em, bone 'em,"
490,00:23:31.83,00:23:31.83,"   and then we'll have, like,  some little rat meat"
491,00:23:33.77,00:23:33.77,in with the rice   that we're eating.
492,00:23:35.00,00:23:35.00,That would be delicious.
493,00:23:39.17,00:23:39.17,  I'm not sure  what a rat might taste like.
494,00:23:40.73,00:23:40.73,  Nobody's said anything to meabout what it could taste like.
495,00:23:43.00,00:23:43.00,GERVASE:  Anytime anybody can hit one
496,00:23:45.10,00:23:45.10,"  over the head, we're hittingthem over the head, too."
497,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87,   Gretchen hit one   the other night--
498,00:23:49.17,00:23:49.17, last night--  with the soup spoon.
499,00:23:50.83,00:23:50.83,  GREG:  This is not  an easy sport.
500,00:23:52.77,00:23:52.77," Oh, no."
501,00:23:55.03,00:23:55.03,( laughing ):That's me!
502,00:23:58.03,00:23:58.03,   The principle of the trap:
503,00:24:00.80,00:24:00.80, This noose is wrapped around the inside of this area here.
504,00:24:04.50,00:24:04.50,  The bait's in there
505,00:24:06.50,00:24:06.50,  and it's getting tugged out by the rat...
506,00:24:11.30,00:24:11.30,   and the noose goes tight.
507,00:24:23.63,00:24:23.63, JOEL:  So here's our plan   with the rats.
508,00:24:25.80,00:24:25.80,   We're going to   chop the head off
509,00:24:27.37,00:24:27.37,"  take the guts out,  take the skin off,"
510,00:24:29.77,00:24:29.77,"   cut the feet off,   and pull the skin   off that way..."
511,00:24:32.73,00:24:32.73," throw a few minnows in there,"
512,00:24:34.50,00:24:34.50,   surf and turf;   minnows and rats.
513,00:24:35.87,00:24:35.87,   ( laughing ):   All right!
514,00:24:37.57,00:24:37.57,I'm telling you guys
515,00:24:38.87,00:24:38.87,we're not going  to want to go home.
516,00:24:40.27,00:24:40.27,   We're set.
517,00:24:41.50,00:24:41.50,"  Bring 'em on, baby. Bring 'em on."
518,00:25:05.40,00:25:05.40, GREG:  Rats aren't bad. Rats are rats.
519,00:25:07.83,00:25:07.83, Questions of edibility
520,00:25:09.07,00:25:09.07,only have to do with your perceptions.
521,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,GERVASE:Smells good.
522,00:25:38.80,00:25:38.80,"Oh, yeah. We're stylin'."
523,00:25:40.27,00:25:40.27,Want some?
524,00:25:41.60,00:25:41.60,"RAMONA:Uh, what doesit taste like?"
525,00:25:43.37,00:25:43.37,   I'm not sure.
526,00:25:44.90,00:25:44.90,Rat?
527,00:25:46.40,00:25:46.40,Tastes like rat.
528,00:25:47.97,00:25:47.97,"Almost like chicken,a little bit."
529,00:25:49.87,00:25:49.87,   Use your imagination.
530,00:25:51.20,00:25:51.20,Am I using a lot of imagination?
531,00:25:53.23,00:25:53.23, Don't smell it.
532,00:25:54.97,00:25:54.97, Don't smell it?
533,00:25:56.27,00:25:56.27, No.
534,00:25:57.70,00:25:57.70, I'm concerned   that it'll be a bit gamy.
535,00:25:59.80,00:25:59.80," We won't have quite the gravy   we're looking for,"
536,00:26:02.20,00:26:02.20, which would really be helpful.
537,00:26:03.97,00:26:03.97," Uh, when cooking rats"
538,00:26:05.60,00:26:05.60,  I would imagine the sauce  is of the utmost importance.
539,00:26:08.03,00:26:08.03,"As poor as we get in the ghetto,  we don't ever eat the rats."
540,00:26:12.50,00:26:12.50, Ever.
541,00:26:14.57,00:26:14.57," Well, you guys are missing something."
542,00:26:16.23,00:26:16.23,  ( laughing )
543,00:26:17.27,00:26:17.27,( groans )
544,00:26:19.60,00:26:19.60, Here.
545,00:26:27.53,00:26:27.53,   All right.
546,00:26:29.07,00:26:29.07,   ( clears throat )
547,00:26:52.13,00:26:52.13,Gervase?
548,00:26:54.30,00:26:54.30,  What do you think?
549,00:26:55.97,00:26:55.97,  You having a  problem there?
550,00:26:58.40,00:26:58.40,We gots to killsome more rats tonight.
551,00:27:01.70,00:27:01.70,( laughing with Joel )
552,00:27:03.30,00:27:03.30,"It's on,till the break of dawn,"
553,00:27:06.50,00:27:06.50,like hot buttered popcorn!
554,00:27:09.43,00:27:09.43,"   Oh, yeah."
555,00:27:10.43,00:27:10.43,  We's about the grub.
556,00:27:13.20,00:27:13.20,"  Joel, can you pass the rat?"
557,00:27:15.53,00:27:15.53,Please?
558,00:27:17.07,00:27:17.07,"Why you hoggingthe rat, Joel?"
559,00:27:18.63,00:27:18.63, Now everybody's taking my rat.
560,00:27:22.20,00:27:22.20,"  They're really, really good."
561,00:27:24.13,00:27:24.13,GERVASE: There's plenty of food on the island.
562,00:27:26.13,00:27:26.13,  You won't starve  with all these rats.
563,00:27:27.77,00:27:27.77,"  There's tons of them and they're everywhere, so..."
564,00:27:30.23,00:27:30.23,there's definitely stuffto eat out here.
565,00:27:32.27,00:27:32.27, I think people would just rather eat
566,00:27:33.90,00:27:33.90," some fish instead, that's all."
567,00:27:45.13,00:27:45.13,   We've got a clue.
568,00:27:46.20,00:27:46.20,RICHARD:Cool.
569,00:27:47.40,00:27:47.40,"""Next challenge,choose smallest member. Stop."
570,00:27:49.83,00:27:49.83,"""The lighter, the better. Stop."
571,00:27:52.80,00:27:52.80,"""An emergencyhas come up. Stop."
572,00:27:55.20,00:27:55.20,"""Build sturdy, maneuverablestructure. Stop."
573,00:27:58.67,00:27:58.67," Tribe's fate may depend on it. Stop."""
574,00:28:01.30,00:28:01.30,That would be Kelly.
575,00:28:02.43,00:28:02.43," We probably have to carry her,"
576,00:28:04.13,00:28:04.13,"   or something, somewhere--a race."
577,00:28:05.73,00:28:05.73,Through the woods.Maneuverable.
578,00:28:05.73,00:28:05.73,"Right, right."
579,00:28:07.73,00:28:07.73,RICHARD: Today's immunity challenge day
580,00:28:09.77,00:28:09.77,"   so we're building a, uh...   stretcher."
581,00:28:11.67,00:28:11.67,Got to be a strong one.
582,00:28:13.27,00:28:13.27," We don't know for what   but, uh..."
583,00:28:14.97,00:28:14.97," obviously, it's a competition"
584,00:28:16.87,00:28:16.87,   that's going to determinewho kicks somebody out tonight.
585,00:28:20.17,00:28:20.17,"RICHARD:We got our mission,Rudy."
586,00:28:22.07,00:28:22.07,Looks like we got to builda stretcher.
587,00:28:24.40,00:28:24.40, Bamboo... bamboo...
588,00:28:26.87,00:28:26.87,"   chicken wire in here,"
589,00:28:29.13,00:28:29.13,a brace here anda brace there.
590,00:28:34.23,00:28:34.23,"   All right, set it   up right there."
591,00:28:42.03,00:28:42.03,Looks likethe head's rusty.
592,00:28:44.33,00:28:44.33, SUSAN: It's important to keep   winning these games because
593,00:28:47.07,00:28:47.07," for one, you win the immunity."
594,00:28:48.60,00:28:48.60,  You don't have to gothrough worrying
595,00:28:50.00,00:28:50.00, about kicking somebody off your team.
596,00:28:51.67,00:28:51.67,"STACEY:  In general,   we're a really tight group."
597,00:28:53.77,00:28:53.77,  We all haveour individual strengths
598,00:28:55.37,00:28:55.37,"  and we're pulling together,"
599,00:28:56.80,00:28:56.80," it's just, if we could  get Rudy out of here"
600,00:28:58.97,00:28:58.97, I think we'd be even stronger.
601,00:29:01.40,00:29:01.40,"It's going tohave to be rope,"
602,00:29:02.70,00:29:02.70, not that little stuff we got.
603,00:29:04.03,00:29:04.03,"No, we got three rollsof the rope, Rudy."
604,00:29:10.47,00:29:10.47,  It's hanging there.
605,00:29:12.43,00:29:12.43,  Why don't you  just tie the rope?
606,00:29:14.03,00:29:14.03, ( indistinct chatter )
607,00:29:15.57,00:29:15.57,"How do you feel,Kell?"
608,00:29:16.63,00:29:16.63, I feel secure.

633,00:30:03.50,00:30:03.50,   We have some idea.
634,00:30:04.83,00:30:04.83, It's going to involve the stretcher
635,00:30:06.37,00:30:06.37,  and an evacuation--an emergency-type thing.

639,00:30:14.77,00:30:14.77,  We can beat them  'cause we got a light person
640,00:30:16.10,00:30:16.10,  and a strong team  pulling her.
641,00:30:17.27,00:30:17.27,It's not goingto be the mostcomfortable ride

650,00:30:52.07,00:30:52.07,"   Hey, guys. Welcome to Larai Larai Beach."
651,00:30:54.80,00:30:54.80,  Another immunity challenge.
652,00:30:56.97,00:30:56.97,  You guys got a note  asking to build a stretcher.
653,00:30:59.40,00:30:59.40,  You were also asked  to pick one member.
654,00:31:01.37,00:31:01.37,"  An hour ago,we took those two people"
655,00:31:02.90,00:31:02.90,  and placed them in a secretlocation in the jungle.
656,00:31:06.93,00:31:06.93, This is an immunity challenge.
657,00:31:08.63,00:31:08.63,"   You know what that means,   but let me spell it out:"
658,00:31:10.57,00:31:10.57, The losers are going to the Tribal Council
659,00:31:12.37,00:31:12.37,   where you have to vote offanother member.
660,00:31:14.03,00:31:14.03,"  All right, for the scenario, I just need one leader"
661,00:31:15.47,00:31:15.47, from each teamto come up here.
662,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50, I'll take that immunity idol.
663,00:31:19.50,00:31:19.50,That's fair game again.
664,00:31:21.13,00:31:21.13,  For today's scenario
665,00:31:22.47,00:31:22.47,imagine there's  been a plane wreck--
666,00:31:24.53,00:31:24.53, this plane right here.
667,00:31:25.93,00:31:25.93, On that plane was one of your tribe members.
668,00:31:27.70,00:31:27.70, The good news is they're okay.
669,00:31:29.27,00:31:29.27,They had a parachute on.
670,00:31:30.43,00:31:30.43, The bad news is they are stuck
671,00:31:32.10,00:31:32.10,"  up in this jungle,  hanging from a tree."
672,00:31:34.50,00:31:34.50,"  Your job is to take your stretcher,"
673,00:31:36.23,00:31:36.23, get up here to where they areand get them back down.
674,00:31:39.33,00:31:39.33,They are equal distance from the beach
675,00:31:41.43,00:31:41.43, so everything is fair.
676,00:31:43.23,00:31:43.23,  Once you get back down here
677,00:31:44.67,00:31:44.67,it's a sprint from here
678,00:31:45.97,00:31:45.97,all the way down to our first aid tent.
679,00:31:47.60,00:31:47.60,You have to have all six people
680,00:31:49.10,00:31:49.10,with one hand on the stretcher.
681,00:31:51.03,00:31:51.03,You guys ready?
682,00:31:53.37,00:31:53.37,Survivors ready?
683,00:31:55.27,00:31:55.27,   This is for immunity. Go!
684,00:32:00.53,00:32:00.53," Go, go, go!"
685,00:32:10.50,00:32:10.50, ( screaming ): Help!

743,00:34:12.80,00:34:12.80,  who you guys are  going to vote off.
744,00:34:14.67,00:34:14.67,"   You got the afternoon   to think about it,"

750,00:34:27.03,00:34:27.03,This is the worst one.

763,00:35:33.43,00:35:33.43,   we've got to vote  somebody out again.
764,00:35:34.90,00:35:34.90, That's what happens every time we lose an immunity challenge.
765,00:35:37.53,00:35:37.53, ( whistling )
766,00:35:40.57,00:35:40.57, KELLY:  I don't think it's going   to get any easier.

768,00:35:45.30,00:35:45.30,it's just going   to suck even more.
769,00:35:47.33,00:35:47.33,STACEY: We haven't been   in this council in six days
770,00:35:50.00,00:35:50.00, and in those six days
771,00:35:51.60,00:35:51.60,"  we've all gottento know each other pretty well,"
772,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10," and I feel bad   'cause I know they're all,"
773,00:35:56.00,00:35:56.00,"  you know, as scared"
774,00:35:57.50,00:35:57.50," about being, you know,   voted off as I am."
775,00:35:59.57,00:35:59.57, I thought it was a done deal
776,00:36:01.43,00:36:01.43,"that Rudy would be the next one    off, but it could be me."
777,00:36:04.40,00:36:04.40, I don't know.
778,00:36:05.60,00:36:05.60,   It's either going to be me
779,00:36:07.73,00:36:07.73,"  or Stacey, you know,  that get voted off."
780,00:36:10.13,00:36:10.13,  I think the younger people   are going to band together.
781,00:36:13.97,00:36:13.97, They're going to get rid of me
782,00:36:16.00,00:36:16.00, then they got    to cutthroat each other.
783,00:36:17.87,00:36:17.87, I'm going to vote Stacey out at the council tonight
784,00:36:20.23,00:36:20.23, 'cause I don't like her
785,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,  and I never will.
786,00:36:24.53,00:36:24.53, SUSAN: I told Stacey  I was going to vote for Rudy.
787,00:36:25.97,00:36:25.97,  But I was thinking about voting for her
788,00:36:27.07,00:36:27.07,  'cause she was the weakest.
789,00:36:28.77,00:36:28.77,  I got to think of the team;   that's what I'm here for.
790,00:36:30.73,00:36:30.73,RICHARD:I've kind of prioritized people
791,00:36:33.97,00:36:33.97,"  based on who's contributing,I think,"
792,00:36:37.77,00:36:37.77, and can contribute most  to the competitions.
793,00:36:39.90,00:36:39.90, I even wanted to talk with the group
794,00:36:41.43,00:36:41.43, about who we were voting for
795,00:36:43.10,00:36:43.10," and let's, you know,    before we even go, know,"
796,00:36:45.20,00:36:45.20,"  so we could talk with the people, but..."
797,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33," boy, did that not fly."

800,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,  I'm not out here    to make friends.
801,00:36:59.20,00:36:59.20,"  People that you're forming   alliances with now,"
802,00:37:01.30,00:37:01.30,"  and the people that you're getting along with now,"
803,00:37:03.70,00:37:03.70, are the people that are going to have
804,00:37:05.50,00:37:05.50," to turn around and vote you,    but somebody's got to go."
805,00:37:08.73,00:37:08.73," So, it's just the way it goes."

809,00:37:41.67,00:37:41.67,Take a seat.
810,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33, I thought about you earlier;
811,00:37:45.20,00:37:45.20, making the long walk from your camp
812,00:37:46.63,00:37:46.63,"  to the middle of the jungle,"
813,00:37:48.27,00:37:48.27,   to Tribal Council   on what has been
814,00:37:49.70,00:37:49.70,one of the weirdest weather days   we've had so far.
815,00:37:52.53,00:37:52.53,"   20 minutes ago,   it was as hot   as it's ever been"
816,00:37:55.03,00:37:55.03, and now we have as big a storm as we've seen.
817,00:37:57.20,00:37:57.20,Going to try a couple of things  differently tonight.
818,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,   One is this conch shell--
819,00:38:01.80,00:38:01.80,the whole idea beingto see if we can get
820,00:38:03.60,00:38:03.60, to a little more truth.
821,00:38:05.03,00:38:05.03,"  You ought to be  able to feel safe,"
822,00:38:06.63,00:38:06.63,to say things herethat maybe you can'tsay back at camp.
823,00:38:09.43,00:38:09.43,"  So, is there anybody here that  has something on their mind?"
824,00:38:12.20,00:38:12.20," Have at it, Richard."
825,00:38:14.07,00:38:14.07,   Keep me. I'm   getting the fish.
826,00:38:15.93,00:38:15.93,   ( laughs )
827,00:38:17.73,00:38:17.73,   I'm bringing in the fish;   don't vote me out.
828,00:38:19.63,00:38:19.63,JEFF:Fair enough.
829,00:38:20.70,00:38:20.70,"  Sean, you and  Dirk went out,"
830,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37, tried to catch fish for a few days.
831,00:38:24.83,00:38:24.83, Went out again today.
832,00:38:26.03,00:38:26.03,Went outagain today.
833,00:38:27.37,00:38:27.37,"Do you feel, even thoughyou're putting forth the effort,"
834,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,  do you feel a bit threatenedby the fact that
835,00:38:31.73,00:38:31.73, when it comes  to assessing people's worth
836,00:38:33.87,00:38:33.87,  Richard did deliverand you haven't
837,00:38:35.27,00:38:35.27," been able to catch any fish,"
838,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67, or is that just one aspect?
839,00:38:38.03,00:38:38.03,"No, I don't think soright now, at this point,"
840,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,but I think that Richard catching fish
841,00:38:41.87,00:38:41.87,"is great for the group,"
842,00:38:43.00,00:38:43.00,and I'm pretty comfortablewith my position.
843,00:38:45.03,00:38:45.03,"I'm somewhat entertaining,sometimes."
844,00:38:46.77,00:38:46.77,"I make people laugh,and I'm keeping people healthy"
845,00:38:49.23,00:38:49.23,"  and, uh, so I'm comfortable with my role--"
846,00:38:51.30,00:38:51.30,fishless or fishworthy.
847,00:38:52.73,00:38:52.73,"   Susan, you've been"
848,00:38:54.33,00:38:54.33,  quiet tonight.
849,00:38:55.90,00:38:55.90,What are you thinking right now?
850,00:38:57.47,00:38:57.47,"  I'm thinking right now that, um, the elimination..."
851,00:39:01.27,00:39:01.27,   the way we vote isbecause of the... competition--
852,00:39:04.73,00:39:04.73,  it's like Rich getting fish for the group.
853,00:39:07.80,00:39:07.80,   That's not coming   into foreplay yet
854,00:39:09.40,00:39:09.40,   'cause we're not starving to death yet.
855,00:39:11.30,00:39:11.30,"Maybe by day 20, we'll be, like,yeah, he can catch fish,"
856,00:39:15.50,00:39:15.50,"he's stayingaround,"
857,00:39:16.70,00:39:16.70," you know, but, uh..."
858,00:39:18.50,00:39:18.50,"All right, it's raining too hard"
859,00:39:20.30,00:39:20.30,  to put you guys through this  any longer.
860,00:39:22.27,00:39:22.27, Anybody want to say anything at all in this downpour?
861,00:39:24.67,00:39:24.67," Stacey, the floor is yours."
862,00:39:26.27,00:39:26.27,"Yeah, you guys,"
863,00:39:27.50,00:39:27.50, I daresay I was happyto eat the bugs
864,00:39:29.50,00:39:29.50,that kept us out of here
865,00:39:31.03,00:39:31.03,"last time,"
866,00:39:33.03,00:39:33.03,"and the games coming up aremy real strong point, so..."
867,00:39:35.40,00:39:35.40,"JEFF:All right, guys."
868,00:39:37.67,00:39:37.67,You got tosurvive the vote
869,00:39:39.33,00:39:39.33,   to keep going on.
870,00:39:40.63,00:39:40.63,"So, Sean, start us off."
871,00:39:45.80,00:39:45.80,"  It's going to be a downpour, buddy. Write clearly."
872,00:39:57.20,00:39:57.20, I'm voting for Stacey.
873,00:39:59.80,00:39:59.80," Um, nothing personal."
874,00:40:01.67,00:40:01.67,I just feel that we need  as much athleticism
875,00:40:04.17,00:40:04.17,and brute force  in this competition.
876,00:40:05.80,00:40:05.80,  I love her to death
877,00:40:07.33,00:40:07.33,   and this is no reflection on the type of person she is.
878,00:40:30.80,00:40:30.80, Rudy.
879,00:41:22.27,00:41:22.27,"  I'll make this quick, guys."
880,00:41:23.53,00:41:23.53, I'll tally the votes.
881,00:41:38.47,00:41:38.47,  Once the votes  are tallied
882,00:41:40.47,00:41:40.47,the decisionis final
883,00:41:42.07,00:41:42.07,  and the person  voted off
884,00:41:43.27,00:41:43.27,will need toleave the islandimmediately.
885,00:41:45.30,00:41:45.30,The good news is
886,00:41:46.67,00:41:46.67, you'll soon be drier.
887,00:41:48.40,00:41:48.40,"With that, I will, uh..."
888,00:41:49.77,00:41:49.77, read the names.
889,00:41:55.23,00:41:55.23, First vote...
890,00:41:58.20,00:41:58.20,"   ""Stacey."""
891,00:42:05.30,00:42:05.30,"   Next vote, fading,"
892,00:42:07.37,00:42:07.37,"""Rudy."""
893,00:42:12.00,00:42:12.00,"   ""Stacey."""
894,00:42:21.43,00:42:21.43,"""Rudy."""
895,00:42:22.47,00:42:22.47," That's two votes for Rudy,"
896,00:42:24.57,00:42:24.57, two votes for Stacey.
897,00:42:30.20,00:42:30.20,"   ""Stacey."""
898,00:42:37.30,00:42:37.30,"   ""Stacey."""
899,00:42:40.00,00:42:40.00,"  That's four  votes, Stacey."
900,00:42:41.90,00:42:41.90,  That's a majority.
901,00:42:43.37,00:42:43.37,  We don't need to  read the last one.
902,00:42:45.33,00:42:45.33,"STACEY:   All right,you switched your vote."
903,00:42:47.50,00:42:47.50,   JEFF:   You need to bring   me your torch
904,00:42:49.00,00:42:49.00," if you would, please.   Thank you."
905,00:42:51.60,00:42:51.60, Thanks.
906,00:42:56.80,00:42:56.80,"   Well, the weather   has spoken"
907,00:42:59.50,00:42:59.50,   and the tribe   has spoken.
908,00:43:01.33,00:43:01.33, Okay.
909,00:43:02.87,00:43:02.87,It's time for you to go.
910,00:43:04.23,00:43:04.23,This way?
911,00:43:04.23,00:43:04.23,Yeah.
912,00:43:05.67,00:43:05.67,  All right.
913,00:43:05.67,00:43:05.67,  Good-bye.
914,00:43:10.27,00:43:10.27,"As for you guys,"
915,00:43:12.03,00:43:12.03,   I don't want to send   you back out in that.
916,00:43:14.10,00:43:14.10," You're welcome to stay here tonight,"
917,00:43:16.13,00:43:16.13,  or until it stops raining...
918,00:43:17.70,00:43:17.70,"   as dry as you can,"
919,00:43:19.63,00:43:19.63," and, uh, I'll see youat some point tomorrow."
920,00:43:22.93,00:43:22.93,  ( thunder rumbling )
921,00:43:26.77,00:43:26.77, ( singing in native language )
922,00:43:42.97,00:43:42.97, Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
923,00:43:46.83,00:43:46.83, Next week on Survivor:
924,00:43:48.83,00:43:48.83, Last night was the worst nightI've ever slept.
925,00:43:53.20,00:43:53.20, I don't want to sleep    in that anymore.
926,00:43:54.57,00:43:54.57,I'm going in the woods.
927,00:43:55.60,00:43:55.60,   I had this vision.
928,00:43:56.87,00:43:56.87,  I thought I'd buildmyself a bowling alley.
929,00:43:58.37,00:43:58.37,We don't need a bowling alley.
930,00:43:59.63,00:43:59.63,RICHARD:  I know what the resolution
931,00:44:01.53,00:44:01.53," to the conflict would be, but I'm planning something different"
932,00:44:04.93,00:44:04.93,   and it's a little sneaky.
933,00:44:06.83,00:44:06.83,  Captioning sponsored by CBSand SURVIVOR PRODUCTIONS
934,00:44:10.87,00:44:10.87,  Captioned by   Media Access Group at WGBHaccess.wgbh.org
935,00:44:13.03,00:44:13.03,They kicked off their bug-eating hero
936,00:44:14.83,00:44:14.83,  instead of their  food-stealing
937,00:44:17.20,00:44:17.20,"  stumbling,  ornery old Navy Seal."
938,00:44:20.67,00:44:20.67," Probably the guys said, ""Well,   we need to vote a woman off"
939,00:44:23.93,00:44:23.93," ""'cause we need   physical strength,"
940,00:44:25.73,00:44:25.73," and, you know, who do we think    is the least productive?"""
941,00:44:28.17,00:44:28.17, And that would be me.
942,00:44:29.67,00:44:29.67,And yet I was much more productive than the four guys.
