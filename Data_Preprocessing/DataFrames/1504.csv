272,00:17:06.75,00:17:06.75,me right here in terms of who Igive this to and how it can come
273,00:17:09.92,00:17:09.92,"back to help me later.Let's see here, what is it you"

280,00:17:34.00,00:17:34.00,I'm going to do my best to benice to him right now so he can
281,00:17:37.12,00:17:37.12,get a good impression of ourcamp.
282,00:17:46.25,00:17:46.25,>> 16 years old.>> Really?
283,00:17:48.33,00:17:48.33,>> Yeah.>> I think Todd's a real cool

285,00:17:52.92,00:17:52.92,"I've got a pretty good hunch.For whatever it's worth, I"
286,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,believe I can trust him.>> I do.
287,00:18:05.25,00:18:05.25,>> That's pretty good.Let's sit down right here.
288,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,"Here you go, bro.Read it and hide it somewhere"
289,00:18:18.25,00:18:18.25,up in the grass or somethinglike that.
290,00:18:26.50,00:18:26.50,>> Deal.>> Deal.

292,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17,">> Appreciate it.>> Cool, man."
293,00:18:33.00,00:18:33.00,">> I trust Todd because I askeda key question of him-- ""Do you"
294,00:18:36.17,00:18:36.17,"believe turnabout's fairplay?""-- because the next one we"
295,00:18:39.12,00:18:39.12,"win, I can only assume we'll bekidnapping somebody, and he'll"
296,00:18:42.29,00:18:42.29,probably get the same thing.So we kind of have a little bit
297,00:18:46.62,00:18:46.62,of a loose alliance from tribeto tribe going on.
298,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,>> I feel very lucky right nowthat Leslie not only gave me the
299,00:19:07.83,00:19:07.83,"clue to the first one, but Davegave me the next two."

301,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,"that could be the hiddenimmunity idol, because that"
302,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,could be the ticket to amillion dollars.
303,00:19:26.50,00:19:26.50,>> You ready?>> Yeah.
304,00:19:28.38,00:19:28.38,>> Want me to carry it?>> Kissing all the girls.
305,00:19:53.33,00:19:53.33,>> I wonder how the other tribeis starting to feel about him.
306,00:19:56.33,00:19:56.33,I was very happy they took Dave.Glad to get him out of my hair
307,00:19:59.04,00:19:59.04,for a couple of days.We haven't had any of that
308,00:20:01.75,00:20:01.75,"conflict going on, so my moodtoday is actually a lot more"
309,00:20:04.21,00:20:04.21,relaxed.It's nice not to have him
310,00:20:06.67,00:20:06.67,around.>> We need to boil water for
311,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,drinking first.>> You guys want to do quick
312,00:20:11.04,00:20:11.04,firewood gathering.>> Dave was really just a
313,00:20:18.42,00:20:18.42,"workhorse, as far as whateverneeded to be done that nobody"
314,00:20:21.33,00:20:21.33,else wanted to do.And that really helped us.
315,00:20:24.92,00:20:24.92,And now we're going to have topick up that slack.
316,00:21:01.71,00:21:01.71,">> Without Dave, we'rescrounging around, trying to"
317,00:21:04.25,00:21:04.25,"get everything done.I don't know, I'm getting"
318,00:21:06.79,00:21:06.79,frustrated because I'm justtired and I feel like some
319,00:21:10.58,00:21:10.58,people are trying to get awaywith not helping out.
320,00:21:16.17,00:21:16.17,>> Sweet!>> Frosti got it!
321,00:21:18.25,00:21:18.25,>> Nice!>> Everybody has been running
322,00:21:20.21,00:21:20.21,"around sweating, trying to do10 million projects, and I feel"
323,00:21:22.33,00:21:22.33,like why even waste energy onsomething that is going to just
324,00:21:25.04,00:21:25.04,drain you.I'm trying to conserve my
325,00:21:29.29,00:21:29.29,energy for the challenges.So if they want to keep
326,00:21:32.04,00:21:32.04,"working, that's okay with me.I'm going to ride the workhorse"
327,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,"until the tails fall off,because I'm not doing anything"
328,00:21:38.00,00:21:38.00,until I have to.>> Fishing boats!
329,00:21:51.58,00:21:51.58,">> They're coming, you guys!>> Hi!"
330,00:21:55.21,00:21:55.21,>> Hi!>> Oh!

342,00:22:42.46,00:22:42.46,"vegetables so much in my life,but they look absolutely"
343,00:22:45.25,00:22:45.25,"terrific.>> When I was a little kid, I"
344,00:22:57.08,00:22:57.08,"spent a few years in Taiwan,and I learned some Mandarin"
345,00:22:59.88,00:22:59.88,over there.>> They can only take two out.
346,00:23:13.25,00:23:13.25,>> Jean-Robert is full ofsurprises.
347,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,"He goes off and starts talkingto these people, and it was"
348,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,fantastic because they wereable to communicate with each
349,00:23:19.25,00:23:19.25,"other, and he knew what theywanted."
350,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,">> Aaron, he's going to tellyou guys what to do."

353,00:23:29.08,00:23:29.08,words and everything startedcoming back to me.
354,00:23:31.67,00:23:31.67,I didn't even know I still hadit.
355,00:23:41.46,00:23:41.46,">> Denise and I went off in thefisherman's boat, and it was"
356,00:23:44.25,00:23:44.25,absolutely the most bizarrething I've ever seen.
357,00:23:51.83,00:23:51.83,"Oh, they're going to go catchthe fish that we're going to"
358,00:23:53.88,00:23:53.88,fish with.And then they can't swallow it.
359,00:24:00.96,00:24:00.96,>> It was incredible!I thought we were going to eat
360,00:24:03.12,00:24:03.12,"the birds when they showed up,and they had them all tied to"
361,00:24:05.71,00:24:05.71,the boat.But they're fishing birds.
362,00:24:08.04,00:24:08.04,"They had them all trained.They could swoop down, pick up"
363,00:24:10.25,00:24:10.25,the fish.The bird will regurgitate the
364,00:24:25.04,00:24:25.04,fish right out of his mouth inthe bottom of the boat.
365,00:24:28.46,00:24:28.46,"And, I mean, he was picking uppretty good-sized fish out"
366,00:24:30.71,00:24:30.71,there.>> Be careful inside when you're
367,00:24:46.25,00:24:46.25,"pulling this out, because thereare teeth that could cut you."
368,00:24:53.25,00:24:53.25,She needs a fire.Fire.
369,00:24:57.50,00:24:57.50,">> Dude, I'm just saying... I'mtranslating what she's saying."
370,00:24:59.38,00:24:59.38,"That's not giving orders.>> Jean-Robert, he got up on"
