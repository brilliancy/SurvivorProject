46,00:02:27.62,00:02:27.62,I'm a professional poker player. And my game plan is starting to
47,00:02:31.21,00:02:31.21,kick in. I'm one of those guys who likes
48,00:02:34.12,00:02:34.12,to start out in last place. I was the last horse.
49,00:02:36.33,00:02:36.33,"Now, I'm just slowly edging up on the pack, and I've kicked ass"
50,00:02:39.17,00:02:39.17,"in the challenges, and my work ethic in the camp has improved,"
51,00:02:43.67,00:02:43.67,and people notice that. >> You're like sucking it up
52,00:02:46.88,00:02:46.88,"already. It's, like, 6:00 in the morning."
53,00:02:49.79,00:02:49.79,">> Getting past last night's vote was big, but at the next"
54,00:02:52.46,00:02:52.46,"tribal council, I'm not that worried, either, because"
55,00:02:55.21,00:02:55.21,Courtney is always the weak link in every challenge.
56,00:02:57.79,00:02:57.79,"And if she survives the next tribal council, she's got to be"
57,00:03:00.75,00:03:00.75,the luckiest girl in Survivor  history.
58,00:03:08.08,00:03:08.08,>> I was afraid it might be hot. >> I was trying to protect you.
59,00:03:15.92,00:03:15.92,">> I'm not getting mad at you, so you don't need to get huffy."
60,00:03:20.29,00:03:20.29,Waking up with Jean-Robert still here is just how I knew
61,00:03:22.88,00:03:22.88,"it would be. He's a cocky son of a bitch,"
62,00:03:25.25,00:03:25.25,"and he sucks so bad, there's no getting out of that."
63,00:03:28.17,00:03:28.17,">> That was like a cautionary, like, ""Careful."""
64,00:03:30.17,00:03:30.17,">> I understand, but just so you know where I'm coming from,"
65,00:03:32.71,00:03:32.71,"I have a gut reaction, I don't like anyone raising their voice"
66,00:03:35.17,00:03:35.17,to me. I don't give a crap who goes
67,00:03:38.00,00:03:38.00,"next, as long as it's not me. I would prefer it be"
68,00:03:40.67,00:03:40.67,Jean-Robert because he's just so unpleasant and he gets in my
69,00:03:43.46,00:03:43.46,"face with no matter what I say. He's just aggressive with me,"
70,00:03:48.58,00:03:48.58,and I'm sick of it. (theme song playing)

76,00:05:26.12,00:05:26.12,"That's bad news. So, we tried to separate out"
77,00:05:29.17,00:05:29.17,the good stuff before it gets worse.
78,00:05:35.00,00:05:35.00,>> Before you pick it up and start mixing up that gunge over

81,00:05:42.79,00:05:42.79,"it in? >> I don't know, man."
82,00:05:44.83,00:05:44.83,Find something. Think of something.
83,00:05:53.25,00:05:53.25,">> Great, you can get that. I'm not eating mold!"
84,00:05:57.54,00:05:57.54,">> Okay, great, you ask for everything."
85,00:05:59.00,00:05:59.00,You are not running the show up in here.

87,00:06:02.71,00:06:02.71,>> Same way you do with everybody else.
88,00:06:04.08,00:06:04.08,"You just listen, listen, listen, right?"
89,00:06:05.92,00:06:05.92,I don't think so. You want everybody to listen
90,00:06:07.50,00:06:07.50,"to you, but you don't listen to nobody else, so shut... stop"
91,00:06:09.42,00:06:09.42,"talking to me, please. >> Sherea, she just came"
92,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,"unglued on me. You know, you've got some"
93,00:06:16.67,00:06:16.67,grounds to say those kind of things if you've done more
94,00:06:19.67,00:06:19.67,around camp. I'm doing my best to be a good
95,00:06:22.67,00:06:22.67,"leader. So, it's frustrating."
96,00:06:38.12,00:06:38.12,>> Sherea! Please do not throw those away.
97,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,>> I wish you wouldn't touch me.
98,00:06:46.96,00:06:46.96,>> Please don't do that. I'm saving some of these shells!
99,00:06:49.50,00:06:49.50,>> Back up off me! Back up off me.
100,00:06:51.92,00:06:51.92,Back the (no audio) up off me. >> Why...
101,00:06:54.75,00:06:54.75,">> I swear to God, back up off me."
102,00:06:56.38,00:06:56.38,>> Why won't you give me some of the shells?
103,00:06:58.17,00:06:58.17,>> Back up off me. >> She won't let me keep the
104,00:07:01.12,00:07:01.12,"shells! >> The last day or so, Dave, I"

106,00:07:09.33,00:07:09.33,"further. >> My God, I just asked to save"
107,00:07:12.08,00:07:12.08,"a few of these things so I can take them back to my mom, you"
108,00:07:15.12,00:07:15.12,know. >> He's just very condescending
109,00:07:17.38,00:07:17.38,the way he talks to people. But nobody is going to run over
110,00:07:20.38,00:07:20.38,"me, talk to me any kind of way. >> I'm not so hot on Sherea"
111,00:07:23.88,00:07:23.88,right now because she's holding on to stuff that I'm not.
112,00:07:26.54,00:07:26.54,>> Uh-huh. >> And everyone else is on
113,00:07:28.92,00:07:28.92,"eggshells, I think, more because of Sherea than me right"
114,00:07:30.50,00:07:30.50,now. >> People right now are seeing
115,00:07:32.42,00:07:32.42,you as something who's just going off all the time.
116,00:07:35.12,00:07:35.12,I do admit you've given a lot of great stuff to this tribe
117,00:07:37.71,00:07:37.71,and we wouldn't be the tribe that we are without you.
118,00:07:40.54,00:07:40.54,We just have to make sure that if you're going to be a
119,00:07:43.67,00:07:43.67,leader... Dave's put himself in a weird
120,00:07:49.17,00:07:49.17,"position with everybody. I mean, he does help around"
121,00:07:51.96,00:07:51.96,camp but he's also pissing people off.
122,00:07:55.12,00:07:55.12,So Crazy Dave may have just worn out his welcome.
123,00:08:06.92,00:08:06.92,>> Tree mail! Let's go!
124,00:08:09.92,00:08:09.92,>> Is it tonight? >> Tribal council.
125,00:08:12.17,00:08:12.17,>> Tribal council? >> What?
126,00:08:14.21,00:08:14.21,">> Oh, boy! >> ""Tonight, both tribes go to"
127,00:08:17.21,00:08:17.21,"tribal council, where fire represents your life."
128,00:08:20.08,00:08:20.08,"In the shadows of the temple, the winners earn less strife."
129,00:08:23.04,00:08:23.04,"This doesn't require lots of brawn, but if you're not agile,"
130,00:08:26.50,00:08:26.50,you'll take a beating. Only the tribe who can stick
131,00:08:29.21,00:08:29.21,"together tomorrow will be eating."""
132,00:08:34.08,00:08:34.08,>> I don't think so. I think it's just at the tribal

134,00:08:37.83,00:08:37.83,">> Oh, my God, you guys. We have got to win this!"
135,00:08:40.54,00:08:40.54,">> Let's win this food, brother. I'm thrilled about this tree"

138,00:08:48.71,00:08:48.71,"virtually eaten nothing. So, for me it's not just"
139,00:08:51.00,00:08:51.00,"exciting, it's, like, necessary."

192,00:11:46.17,00:11:46.17,their first ball down the chute. They're heading back!
193,00:11:52.17,00:11:52.17,Peih-gee and Sherea still working on that first fireball.
194,00:11:55.62,00:11:55.62,"They have it for Zhan Hu, and they race back!"
195,00:12:01.04,00:12:01.04,"Amanda and Aaron, working together now on that second"
196,00:12:03.42,00:12:03.42,ball for Fei Long. It's Jaime and Frosti now for
197,00:12:08.67,00:12:08.67,"Zhan Hu, working on that second fireball."
198,00:12:12.33,00:12:12.33,"The longer the chopsticks get, the more difficult they are to"
199,00:12:15.33,00:12:15.33,"handle. >> Up, up."
200,00:12:17.83,00:12:17.83,>> PROBST: Frosti having to maneuver with the flames
201,00:12:20.25,00:12:20.25,"hitting his hands, burning him. They're on the wrong side of"
202,00:12:22.67,00:12:22.67,that flame box. Amanda and Aaron working
203,00:12:25.38,00:12:25.38,"together, moving slowly but making ground."
204,00:12:29.92,00:12:29.92,>> A little bit at a time. >> PROBST: Jaime and Frosti
205,00:12:32.08,00:12:32.08,still in it. Both tribes even with one ball.
206,00:12:35.62,00:12:35.62,Aaron and Amanda doing a great job.
207,00:12:40.25,00:12:40.25,Jamie and Frosti trying to gain on them.
208,00:12:43.29,00:12:43.29,Aaron and Amanda have the big task now of getting up high
209,00:12:45.79,00:12:45.79,enough to drop it in the chute. Aaron and Amanda have it.
210,00:12:49.29,00:12:49.29,They have their second one for Fei Long.
211,00:12:52.17,00:12:52.17,>> Whoo! >> PROBST: Amy and Frosti close.
212,00:12:57.12,00:12:57.12,Jamie and Frosti have the second ball for Zhan Hu.
213,00:12:59.67,00:12:59.67,We are dead even. James and Jean-Robert working on
214,00:13:03.71,00:13:03.71,the third and final ball for Fei Long.
215,00:13:06.71,00:13:06.71,">> These sticks are impossible! >> Just focus, man."
216,00:13:09.12,00:13:09.12,"This is not impossible. >> I got it, I got it."
217,00:13:11.25,00:13:11.25,>> PROBST: It's Dave and Erik now for Zhan Hu.
218,00:13:15.00,00:13:15.00,James and Jean-Robert making a little progress.
219,00:13:19.83,00:13:19.83,"Dave and Erik working with those long chopsticks, much"
220,00:13:23.17,00:13:23.17,more difficult. >> Ah!
221,00:13:25.46,00:13:25.46,>> Go forward with it! You have to move at least an
222,00:13:27.71,00:13:27.71,inch every time! >> PROBST: Dave and Erik getting
223,00:13:29.75,00:13:29.75,a lot of advice from their tribe.
224,00:13:31.83,00:13:31.83,It's not helping. James and Jean-Robert getting
225,00:13:34.42,00:13:34.42,"closer. Big reward on the line-- fish,"
226,00:13:39.17,00:13:39.17,"vegetables, spices. Dave and Erik are going to have"
227,00:13:43.33,00:13:43.33,to do something heroic. Jean-Robert and James very
228,00:13:47.17,00:13:47.17,close. This could be it.
229,00:13:51.00,00:13:51.00,"Jean-Robert, so close. >> Dave, get low!"
230,00:13:54.38,00:13:54.38,"Dave, get low! >> Go at the same time."
231,00:13:58.04,00:13:58.04,>> PROBST: James and Jean-Robert so close.
232,00:13:59.46,00:13:59.46,Trying to hang on. Almost had it.
233,00:14:02.50,00:14:02.50,Opening the door for Erik and Dave.
234,00:14:06.17,00:14:06.17,"A few inches at a time, they are gaining on James and"
235,00:14:09.17,00:14:09.17,Jean-Robert. >> Lift it like this.
236,00:14:11.42,00:14:11.42,>> PROBST: Next fireball down the chute wins.
237,00:14:14.58,00:14:14.58,This could be it for Fei Long. And it is!
238,00:14:18.12,00:14:18.12,(cheers) >> Yes!
239,00:14:20.88,00:14:20.88,>> PROBST: Fei Long wins reward! >> Yes!
240,00:14:23.50,00:14:23.50,">> Oh, yeah! >> PROBST: All right, Fei Long,"
241,00:14:31.92,00:14:31.92,congratulations. (applause)
242,00:14:36.08,00:14:36.08,You're now going to kidnap one member of Zhan Hu's tribe.
243,00:14:39.25,00:14:39.25,Who's it going to be? >> Dave or Jaime.
244,00:14:44.00,00:14:44.00,It doesn't matter. >> It's Dave.
245,00:14:46.29,00:14:46.29,">> PROBST: Dave, head on over. You are going to spend time"
246,00:14:49.58,00:14:49.58,"with Fei Long. Dave, you will remain with Fei"
247,00:14:52.75,00:14:52.75,Long until the next immunity challenge.
248,00:14:56.75,00:14:56.75,"All right, Dave, this is for you."
249,00:14:59.12,00:14:59.12,"You know the drill. It says, ""open in private."""
250,00:15:03.71,00:15:03.71,"That means private and alone. Zhan Hu, got nothing for you."
251,00:15:08.50,00:15:08.50,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
252,00:15:09.96,00:15:09.96,"Good night. >> See you, folks."
253,00:15:12.62,00:15:12.62,">> Bye. >> PROBST: All right, guys, grab"
254,00:15:14.92,00:15:14.92,your flag. Head on back to camp.
255,00:15:16.33,00:15:16.33,Enjoy tomorrow. (laughs)
256,00:15:44.17,00:15:44.17,">> Yeah! Escargot, dawg."
257,00:15:49.50,00:15:49.50,">> Oh, man, I feel like I'm on vacation right now."
258,00:15:53.08,00:15:53.08,It's just absolutely wonderful. I'm going to eat well with
259,00:15:56.25,00:15:56.25,them today. And given the friction between
260,00:15:58.21,00:15:58.21,"Sherea and I, I couldn't ask for a better time to be"
261,00:16:01.29,00:16:01.29,"kidnapped. Good morning, everybody."
262,00:16:05.08,00:16:05.08,"What you eating on there? >> You're right, you're right."
263,00:16:14.58,00:16:14.58,I apologize. Some of my tribe are definitely
264,00:16:17.04,00:16:17.04,"threatening to me, and that means I'm going to have to be"
265,00:16:19.88,00:16:19.88,"aligned with other people. So it is a spy mission, but"
266,00:16:23.79,00:16:23.79,"it's a spy mission for me. >> ""In this sealed tube is a"
267,00:16:45.17,00:16:45.17,clue to a hidden immunity idol.
268,00:16:49.71,00:16:49.71,You must give this sealed clue to a member of this tribe
269,00:16:53.00,00:16:53.00,"before you rejoin your own tribe."""
270,00:16:55.17,00:16:55.17,(laughs) Great.
271,00:17:00.17,00:17:00.17,I've got to chew my noodle on who am I going to give the clue
272,00:17:02.75,00:17:02.75,to the hidden immunity idol to? This could be a crucial play for
273,00:17:06.75,00:17:06.75,me right here in terms of who I give this to and how it can come
274,00:17:09.92,00:17:09.92,"back to help me later. Let's see here, what is it you"
275,00:17:15.12,00:17:15.12,"do, Courtney? >> No kidding, man!"
276,00:17:20.04,00:17:20.04,I love that place! You make me miss New York so
277,00:17:23.17,00:17:23.17,much! I want to go back.
278,00:17:26.33,00:17:26.33,>> Dave is a nutcase. >> I can give you... I can give
279,00:17:28.88,00:17:28.88,you a little plumbers butt if you want.
280,00:17:31.00,00:17:31.00,"Excuse me. >> It's annoying as hell, but"
281,00:17:34.00,00:17:34.00,I'm going to do my best to be nice to him right now so he can
282,00:17:37.12,00:17:37.12,get a good impression of our camp.
283,00:17:46.25,00:17:46.25,>> 16 years old. >> Really?
284,00:17:48.33,00:17:48.33,>> Yeah. >> I think Todd's a real cool
285,00:17:50.25,00:17:50.25,"guy. He wants to play the game, and"
286,00:17:52.92,00:17:52.92,"I've got a pretty good hunch. For whatever it's worth, I"
287,00:17:56.25,00:17:56.25,believe I can trust him. >> I do.
288,00:18:05.25,00:18:05.25,>> That's pretty good. Let's sit down right here.
289,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,"Here you go, bro. Read it and hide it somewhere"
290,00:18:18.25,00:18:18.25,up in the grass or something like that.
291,00:18:26.50,00:18:26.50,>> Deal. >> Deal.
292,00:18:28.17,00:18:28.17,">> Thank you, man. >> Sweet."
293,00:18:30.17,00:18:30.17,">> Appreciate it. >> Cool, man."
294,00:18:33.00,00:18:33.00,">> I trust Todd because I asked a key question of him-- ""Do you"
295,00:18:36.17,00:18:36.17,"believe turnabout's fair play?""-- because the next one we"
296,00:18:39.12,00:18:39.12,"win, I can only assume we'll be kidnapping somebody, and he'll"
297,00:18:42.29,00:18:42.29,probably get the same thing. So we kind of have a little bit
298,00:18:46.62,00:18:46.62,of a loose alliance from tribe to tribe going on.
299,00:19:05.17,00:19:05.17,>> I feel very lucky right now that Leslie not only gave me the
300,00:19:07.83,00:19:07.83,"clue to the first one, but Dave gave me the next two."
301,00:19:12.42,00:19:12.42,"So I've been keeping my eyes open, looking for something"
302,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,"that could be the hidden immunity idol, because that"
303,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,could be the ticket to a million dollars.
304,00:19:26.50,00:19:26.50,>> You ready? >> Yeah.
305,00:19:28.38,00:19:28.38,>> Want me to carry it? >> Kissing all the girls.
306,00:19:53.33,00:19:53.33,>> I wonder how the other tribe is starting to feel about him.
307,00:19:56.33,00:19:56.33,I was very happy they took Dave. Glad to get him out of my hair
308,00:19:59.04,00:19:59.04,for a couple of days. We haven't had any of that
309,00:20:01.75,00:20:01.75,"conflict going on, so my mood today is actually a lot more"
310,00:20:04.21,00:20:04.21,relaxed. It's nice not to have him
311,00:20:06.67,00:20:06.67,around. >> We need to boil water for
312,00:20:08.67,00:20:08.67,drinking first. >> You guys want to do quick
313,00:20:11.04,00:20:11.04,firewood gathering. >> Dave was really just a
314,00:20:18.42,00:20:18.42,"workhorse, as far as whatever needed to be done that nobody"
315,00:20:21.33,00:20:21.33,else wanted to do. And that really helped us.
316,00:20:24.92,00:20:24.92,And now we're going to have to pick up that slack.
317,00:21:01.71,00:21:01.71,">> Without Dave, we're scrounging around, trying to"
318,00:21:04.25,00:21:04.25,"get everything done. I don't know, I'm getting"
319,00:21:06.79,00:21:06.79,frustrated because I'm just tired and I feel like some
320,00:21:10.58,00:21:10.58,people are trying to get away with not helping out.
321,00:21:16.17,00:21:16.17,>> Sweet! >> Frosti got it!
322,00:21:18.25,00:21:18.25,>> Nice! >> Everybody has been running
323,00:21:20.21,00:21:20.21,"around sweating, trying to do 10 million projects, and I feel"
324,00:21:22.33,00:21:22.33,like why even waste energy on something that is going to just
325,00:21:25.04,00:21:25.04,drain you. I'm trying to conserve my
326,00:21:29.29,00:21:29.29,energy for the challenges. So if they want to keep
327,00:21:32.04,00:21:32.04,"working, that's okay with me. I'm going to ride the workhorse"
328,00:21:35.17,00:21:35.17,"until the tails fall off, because I'm not doing anything"
329,00:21:38.00,00:21:38.00,until I have to. >> Fishing boats!
330,00:21:51.58,00:21:51.58,">> They're coming, you guys! >> Hi!"
331,00:21:55.21,00:21:55.21,>> Hi! >> Oh!
332,00:21:57.71,00:21:57.71,"Our reward today, we had a fisherman family come with their"
333,00:22:01.62,00:22:01.62,"boat, and they are going to cook us a meal, and also teach some"
334,00:22:05.33,00:22:05.33,of us how to fish. >> They said a family.
335,00:22:18.62,00:22:18.62,>> This is the best reward that we've ever had.
336,00:22:20.96,00:22:20.96,"The fisherman came, the family came."
337,00:22:23.33,00:22:23.33,I am so grateful for them to be here today.
338,00:22:26.21,00:22:26.21,Their children are so pretty. Everybody is so nice.
339,00:22:29.29,00:22:29.29,>> Peppers! >> We've got eggs!
340,00:22:32.17,00:22:32.17,">> Catfish! >> They came with huge fish,"
341,00:22:36.08,00:22:36.08,vegetables. They came with oils and spices.
342,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,">> Oh, my God! I never thought I would miss"
343,00:22:42.46,00:22:42.46,"vegetables so much in my life, but they look absolutely"
344,00:22:45.25,00:22:45.25,"terrific. >> When I was a little kid, I"
345,00:22:57.08,00:22:57.08,"spent a few years in Taiwan, and I learned some Mandarin"
346,00:22:59.88,00:22:59.88,over there. >> They can only take two out.
347,00:23:13.25,00:23:13.25,>> Jean-Robert is full of surprises.
348,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,"He goes off and starts talking to these people, and it was"
349,00:23:17.17,00:23:17.17,fantastic because they were able to communicate with each
350,00:23:19.25,00:23:19.25,"other, and he knew what they wanted."
351,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,">> Aaron, he's going to tell you guys what to do."
352,00:23:23.08,00:23:23.08,">> It's been 20 years since I've used Mandarin, but"
353,00:23:25.88,00:23:25.88,"honestly, when that family came, all of a sudden, just"
354,00:23:29.08,00:23:29.08,words and everything started coming back to me.
355,00:23:31.67,00:23:31.67,I didn't even know I still had it.
356,00:23:41.46,00:23:41.46,">> Denise and I went off in the fisherman's boat, and it was"
357,00:23:44.25,00:23:44.25,absolutely the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
358,00:23:51.83,00:23:51.83,"Oh, they're going to go catch the fish that we're going to"
359,00:23:53.88,00:23:53.88,fish with. And then they can't swallow it.
360,00:24:00.96,00:24:00.96,>> It was incredible! I thought we were going to eat
361,00:24:03.12,00:24:03.12,"the birds when they showed up, and they had them all tied to"
362,00:24:05.71,00:24:05.71,the boat. But they're fishing birds.
363,00:24:08.04,00:24:08.04,"They had them all trained. They could swoop down, pick up"
364,00:24:10.25,00:24:10.25,the fish. The bird will regurgitate the
365,00:24:25.04,00:24:25.04,fish right out of his mouth in the bottom of the boat.
366,00:24:28.46,00:24:28.46,"And, I mean, he was picking up pretty good-sized fish out"
367,00:24:30.71,00:24:30.71,there. >> Be careful inside when you're
368,00:24:46.25,00:24:46.25,"pulling this out, because there are teeth that could cut you."
369,00:24:53.25,00:24:53.25,She needs a fire. Fire.
370,00:24:57.50,00:24:57.50,">> Dude, I'm just saying... I'm translating what she's saying."
371,00:24:59.38,00:24:59.38,"That's not giving orders. >> Jean-Robert, he got up on"
372,00:25:02.42,00:25:02.42,"his high horse as he usually do, kind of got on everybody's"
373,00:25:05.12,00:25:05.12,nerves-- really mine. >> I said she's asking for
374,00:25:07.71,00:25:07.71,a fire. >> He was just sitting there
375,00:25:13.08,00:25:13.08,"being Jean-Robert, but we needed him."
376,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,He was like the language- barrier guy.
377,00:25:17.38,00:25:17.38,He came through. I really couldn't fault him.
378,00:25:19.29,00:25:19.29,He did good. >> The fisherman showed us how
379,00:25:27.12,00:25:27.12,"to open the net, and then he stretched it out across the"
380,00:25:29.67,00:25:29.67,lake so when the fish come they just swim right into the
381,00:25:32.83,00:25:32.83,"net. Before, we didn't even know how"
382,00:25:35.25,00:25:35.25,to use the net. But now we're going to have
383,00:25:37.38,00:25:37.38,fish. It's going to be great.
384,00:25:43.54,00:25:43.54,>> Ahoy. >> Hi.
385,00:25:45.04,00:25:45.04,">> Ahoy, matey. >> Oh, my God!"
386,00:25:54.17,00:25:54.17,">> You guys know what ""hao chi"" means?"
387,00:25:55.92,00:25:55.92,"""Hao"" is good, and ""chi"" is eat. >> I've never been so happy in"
388,00:26:01.46,00:26:01.46,"my life. >> Oh, my God, after being out"
389,00:26:04.25,00:26:04.25,"here all this time, flavor has never tasted so good."
390,00:26:09.25,00:26:09.25,"Oh, my God! That's spicy!"
391,00:26:11.92,00:26:11.92,"You know, a lunch lady is not an expert on food, because you"
392,00:26:14.12,00:26:14.12,know what we do? We take the chicken nuggets out
393,00:26:16.38,00:26:16.38,"of the freezer, we put them in the oven, we give them to the"
394,00:26:18.42,00:26:18.42,kids. There's nothing good about that.
395,00:26:21.25,00:26:21.25,"But this stuff here, that was the delicatest thing that I've"
396,00:26:25.12,00:26:25.12,ever put in my mouth. >> Thank you.
397,00:26:28.71,00:26:28.71,>> Thank you so much. >> This reward was key for us.
398,00:26:34.25,00:26:34.25,It's not only that we get a meal but it's a cultural
399,00:26:36.83,00:26:36.83,"learning experience, and I really do think that we're"
400,00:26:41.00,00:26:41.00,"going to be eating better, and definitely have an advantage in"
401,00:26:44.67,00:26:44.67,the challenges to come. >> Bye-bye!
402,00:26:48.04,00:26:48.04,>> Bye-bye! Bye!
403,00:27:03.83,00:27:03.83,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. So, Dave, time to rejoin Zhan"
404,00:27:20.04,00:27:20.04,"Hu. >> Hi, guys."

406,00:27:26.25,00:27:26.25,ready to get to today's challenge?
407,00:27:27.33,00:27:27.33,>> Yeah. >> Let's do it.
408,00:27:29.08,00:27:29.08,>> PROBST: First things first-- immunity coming back.
409,00:27:31.21,00:27:31.21,">> See you soon, buddy. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
410,00:27:36.67,00:27:36.67,is back up for grabs. Here's how the challenge is
411,00:27:39.67,00:27:39.67,"going to play out: for your own protection, you will each be"
412,00:27:42.75,00:27:42.75,dressed in traditional Chinese armor.
413,00:27:48.21,00:27:48.21,You'll square off in our gladiator arena.
414,00:27:51.62,00:27:51.62,"Behind each tribe, there are porcelain vases."
415,00:27:54.92,00:27:54.92,"You will throw meteor hammers, attempting to smash the other"
416,00:27:58.33,00:27:58.33,tribe's vases while blocking your opponent's throws with a
417,00:28:01.96,00:28:01.96,bamboo pole. We'll go in rounds.
418,00:28:04.67,00:28:04.67,"First round will be two women on a team, then two men, then one"
419,00:28:07.96,00:28:07.96,"man, one woman. The tribe that breaks the most"
420,00:28:10.96,00:28:10.96,"vases in those three rounds wins immunity, safe at least"
421,00:28:15.12,00:28:15.12,another day here in China. Losers go to tribal council
422,00:28:18.67,00:28:18.67,"tonight, somebody going home. Fei Long, you have one more"
423,00:28:21.79,00:28:21.79,member. You're sitting somebody out.
424,00:28:23.38,00:28:23.38,Cannot sit out the same people in back-to-back challenges.
425,00:28:26.00,00:28:26.00,Courtney sat out the last challenge.
426,00:28:27.75,00:28:27.75,She'll be participating in this.
427,00:28:29.29,00:28:29.29,You must sit out one man. >> It has to be either me or
428,00:28:32.50,00:28:32.50,Todd. >> PROBST: Who's sitting this
429,00:28:35.67,00:28:35.67,one out? >> Jean-Robert is going to sit
430,00:28:37.38,00:28:37.38,out. >> PROBST: Jean-Robert is
431,00:28:38.50,00:28:38.50,"sitting out. All right, we'll get started."

437,00:29:06.71,00:29:06.71,Each team will have three throws per round.
438,00:29:10.21,00:29:10.21,Here we go. Survivors ready?
439,00:29:13.46,00:29:13.46,"Go. >> Let's get them, guys."
440,00:29:17.79,00:29:17.79,Watch what they're doing. Watch what they're doing.
441,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,>> PROBST: Denise winding up. Denise launches first.
442,00:29:27.25,00:29:27.25,She's way over the top. >> Pick up another one!
443,00:29:30.12,00:29:30.12,>> PROBST: Peih-gee swinging. Peih-gee short.
444,00:29:34.25,00:29:34.25,You've gotta get some oomph on these.
445,00:29:36.38,00:29:36.38,Sherea winding up now. She launches one.
446,00:29:40.17,00:29:40.17,Almost knocks it off. Courtney winds up.
447,00:29:43.29,00:29:43.29,">> Come on, get it, baby! >> PROBST: She's short."
448,00:29:46.25,00:29:46.25,">> Go, go, go. >> PROBST: Denise winding up."
449,00:29:48.25,00:29:48.25,She tosses her last one. Blocked nicely by Peih-gee.
450,00:29:52.46,00:29:52.46,Peih-gee gives the last one to Sherea.
451,00:29:55.08,00:29:55.08,">> Come on, Sherea! >> PROBST: Sherea launches the"
452,00:29:59.21,00:29:59.21,last one and scores! Round one is over.
453,00:30:02.12,00:30:02.12,Zhan Hu scores one. Zhan Hu leads 1-0.
454,00:30:06.25,00:30:06.25,"Next round, two men for each team."
455,00:30:10.17,00:30:10.17,"For Fei Long, it is Todd and James."
456,00:30:12.42,00:30:12.42,"For Zhan Hu, Frosti, Dave. Zhan Hu leads 1-0."
457,00:30:16.50,00:30:16.50,Here we go. Survivors ready?
458,00:30:19.92,00:30:19.92,"Go. >> Go, guys!"
459,00:30:22.96,00:30:22.96,">> PROBST: Todd and James both pick up meteor hammers, as"
460,00:30:24.92,00:30:24.92,do Frosti and Dave. Gonna be a little more velocity
461,00:30:28.88,00:30:28.88,from the guys. Dave launches and just misses.
462,00:30:32.17,00:30:32.17,Frosti winding up. He launches and just misses.
463,00:30:34.88,00:30:34.88,">> Come on, guys, do it, do it. >> PROBST: Todd and James both"
464,00:30:38.50,00:30:38.50,"launch and both connect! Two for Fei Long, they lead 2-1."
465,00:30:43.33,00:30:43.33,"Frosti winding up, throws it right at James, who deflects"
466,00:30:48.25,00:30:48.25,it. James winding up.
467,00:30:51.96,00:30:51.96,It's 2-1. James has the last throw.
468,00:30:56.04,00:30:56.04,>> Yes! >> PROBST: James connects again!
469,00:30:59.42,00:30:59.42,"Fei Long leads 3-1. Next two head out, the"
470,00:31:04.00,00:31:04.00,remaining man and the remaining woman from each tribe.
471,00:31:07.00,00:31:07.00,"For Fei Long, it is Amanda and Aaron."
472,00:31:10.25,00:31:10.25,"For Zhan Hu, it's Jaime and Erik."
473,00:31:12.88,00:31:12.88,">> Go, Zhan Hu! >> PROBST: Fei Long leads 3-1."
474,00:31:15.17,00:31:15.17,"Zhan Hu, you have a lot of catching up to do."
475,00:31:17.79,00:31:17.79,This is it. Each side has three shots.
476,00:31:20.38,00:31:20.38,Here we go. Survivors ready?

478,00:31:28.67,00:31:28.67,up meteor hammers. Jaime swinging hers.

488,00:32:07.12,00:32:07.12,You have to break two vases to win.
489,00:32:09.21,00:32:09.21,Jaime did it before. Can she do it again?
490,00:32:12.08,00:32:12.08,">> Come on, Jaime! >> PROBST: Jaime launches."
491,00:32:17.21,00:32:17.21,"No, Jaime and Erik can't do it. Fei Long wins immunity!"
492,00:32:20.21,00:32:20.21,">> Whoo! >> Good job, guys."
493,00:32:24.29,00:32:24.29,"Good job, guys. >> PROBST: Fei Long,"
494,00:32:29.08,00:32:29.08,congratulations. Immunity once again.
495,00:32:32.08,00:32:32.08,(applause) Nobody going home from Fei Long.
496,00:32:36.71,00:32:36.71,"Zhan Hu, tribal council tonight. One of the six of you will be"
497,00:32:40.08,00:32:40.08,"voted out. Grab your stuff, head back to"
498,00:32:42.46,00:32:42.46,camp. See you at tribal.
499,00:33:04.29,00:33:04.29,>> It was. It was hard.
500,00:33:07.54,00:33:07.54,">> Maybe we should eat first, let our food digest."
501,00:33:13.25,00:33:13.25,>> You want to dump that out so I can get well water for that?
502,00:33:17.96,00:33:17.96,">> Well, I mean, considering parasites and stuff, I'd like to"
503,00:33:20.08,00:33:20.08,use a lot less lake water as possible.
504,00:33:22.88,00:33:22.88,You know what I mean? >> Infinitely better just using
505,00:33:28.17,00:33:28.17,"straight well water. In fact, I'll run and get some,"
506,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,if you want. >> I don't care.
507,00:33:33.38,00:33:33.38,">> I don't care, either. >> It feels very strange to be"
508,00:33:36.79,00:33:36.79,back here at Zhan Hu. We lost the immunity challenge
509,00:33:39.38,00:33:39.38,"today, and I don't want to go home."
510,00:33:42.71,00:33:42.71,But there's very strange vibes going on.
511,00:33:45.25,00:33:45.25,"Maybe it was just the day and a half away from me, or, you"
512,00:33:47.75,00:33:47.75,"know, my slave-driving ability. But, I don't know, I'm feeling"
513,00:33:52.75,00:33:52.75,"very precarious right now. >> Today, we have to decide who"
514,00:34:39.62,00:34:39.62,to vote off. It's probably going to be
515,00:34:42.25,00:34:42.25,"between Sherea and Dave. It's a tough decision because,"
516,00:34:45.04,00:34:45.04,"Sherea, she doesn't really help out as much as the rest of us"
517,00:34:47.88,00:34:47.88,"do on camp. On the other hand, Dave's just"
518,00:34:50.04,00:34:50.04,really annoying and really hard to live with.
519,00:35:14.71,00:35:14.71,">> She's like, ""I'm so tired. I'm weak."
520,00:35:16.88,00:35:16.88,"I need to save my energy for challenges"" and just kind of"
521,00:35:18.96,00:35:18.96,"got into that mode. ""Hey, everybody's cool with"
522,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,"me laying around and not doing much of anything."""
523,00:35:26.12,00:35:26.12,>> They all decided to go take a dip in the lake.
524,00:35:28.42,00:35:28.42,"And of course, when voices get low, you know something's going"
525,00:35:30.54,00:35:30.54,on. I am concerned that me not
526,00:35:33.71,00:35:33.71,doing as much around camp is affecting everybody else's
527,00:35:36.46,00:35:36.46,"opinion. So, I already know that my name"
528,00:35:39.83,00:35:39.83,may be written down tonight. People just looking at people
529,00:35:52.83,00:35:52.83,"around camp, or people looking at people in challenges."
530,00:35:54.96,00:35:54.96,You know what I'm saying? You never know what people are
531,00:35:57.29,00:35:57.29,thinking. >> But we do have to make these
532,00:35:59.83,00:35:59.83,judgments so quick. >> Everybody pulls their weight
533,00:36:02.12,00:36:02.12,"in different ways. I mean, yeah, I don't do"
534,00:36:04.12,00:36:04.12,"everything around camp, but I get to a challenge, I'm going"
535,00:36:06.79,00:36:06.79,to bust my ass to make sure we win.
536,00:36:09.04,00:36:09.04,Everybody busting their butts the first few days and
537,00:36:11.46,00:36:11.46,"everybody else is getting, like, fatigued."
538,00:36:15.08,00:36:15.08,"My body comes first, you know. >> It's really close toss-up"
539,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,between Sherea's not working and Dave's kind of making
540,00:36:26.79,00:36:26.79,everybody crazy. It's just been back and forth
541,00:36:29.33,00:36:29.33,"in my mind. I think if it were up to me,"
542,00:36:32.17,00:36:32.17,"you know, if we could get rid of both of them, it would be"
543,00:36:35.12,00:36:35.12,"great. >> PROBST: Sherea, how did the"
544,00:37:02.75,00:37:02.75,tribe dynamic change having Dave gone for a day?
545,00:37:06.04,00:37:06.04,>> We were able to go ahead and move on and get things going
546,00:37:09.08,00:37:09.08,the same way we would if he was there.
547,00:37:12.00,00:37:12.00,"We had some relaxing time and some chill time, but we still"
548,00:37:14.79,00:37:14.79,kept busy and got things done when he was gone.
549,00:37:17.21,00:37:17.21,">> PROBST: Frosti, is that a credit to Dave for establishing"
550,00:37:19.96,00:37:19.96,maybe a work ethic that keeps on even when he's gone?
551,00:37:22.92,00:37:22.92,>> It can definitely be seen as a credit to Dave's name.
552,00:37:26.08,00:37:26.08,"I mean, he got us going on making sure we had water"
553,00:37:28.54,00:37:28.54,"boiling at all times. We got food done, and even"
554,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,"without him there, we accomplished a lot, so..."
555,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,">> PROBST: Erik, you were nodding your head."
556,00:37:37.79,00:37:37.79,">> I like Dave. And, honestly, there's been"
557,00:37:40.21,00:37:40.21,"some disagreements, and it frustrates me seeing other"
558,00:37:43.12,00:37:43.12,people not kind of receiving Dave's leadership.
559,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,"You know, Dave has great leadership qualities."
560,00:37:48.96,00:37:48.96,It's just his natural personality.
561,00:37:50.88,00:37:50.88,">> PROBST: Dave, would it be a bit of a relief to go back to"
562,00:37:53.04,00:37:53.04,camp and not have to lead tonight?
563,00:37:54.96,00:37:54.96,>> Absolutely. It's been quite a burden.
564,00:37:57.04,00:37:57.04,It's been something I didn't want to begin with.
565,00:37:58.92,00:37:58.92,I just happen to have more experience and more practical
566,00:38:01.25,00:38:01.25,"ideas, and that's how we got where we are today."
567,00:38:05.75,00:38:05.75,>> PROBST: Let's talk about camp life.
568,00:38:07.71,00:38:07.71,You've been out here 12 days now.
569,00:38:09.67,00:38:09.67,"Sherea, everybody still pulling their own weight?"
570,00:38:11.54,00:38:11.54,">> Definitely, everybody's doing something."
571,00:38:13.29,00:38:13.29,I'm stepping it up a lot more. >> PROBST: From what to what?
572,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,">> I've been very fatigued, and, just, my body hasn't been in it"
573,00:38:20.92,00:38:20.92,"when I'm around, you know, the camp area, so the last few days,"
574,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,I've been trying to do more. But if we don't save our energy
575,00:38:26.79,00:38:26.79,"for challenges, we'll never get further ahead in the game."
576,00:38:31.50,00:38:31.50,">> PROBST: Dave, is camp life more important than challenge"
577,00:38:35.12,00:38:35.12,"participation, or should you sacrifice at camp to make sure"
578,00:38:38.46,00:38:38.46,you have a shot at winning? >> Saving just for challenges
579,00:38:42.08,00:38:42.08,"is a short-term goal, because if you are not fed, if you are"
580,00:38:44.96,00:38:44.96,"not rested and hydrated, it will just take its toll."
581,00:38:48.71,00:38:48.71,">> PROBST: Peih-gee, if given the choice between somebody"
582,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,pulling their weight back at camp or being invincible at
583,00:38:54.50,00:38:54.50,"challenges? >> You know, honestly, I know"
584,00:38:56.71,00:38:56.71,"you want me to pick one, but you can't."
585,00:38:59.42,00:38:59.42,"You need to have a balance between the two, and if you"
586,00:39:01.33,00:39:01.33,"don't, it's going to put an undue burden on the rest of the"
587,00:39:03.96,00:39:03.96,tribe. >> She enjoys camp life.
588,00:39:06.88,00:39:06.88,I live for the challenges. She loves to be out here in
589,00:39:09.33,00:39:09.33,"this environment. >> I love the challenges, too."
590,00:39:12.12,00:39:12.12,">> I know, but I'm just saying that's why you can say"
591,00:39:14.25,00:39:14.25,"both. She's always like, ""Yeah, I"
592,00:39:16.04,00:39:16.04,"love it out here! This is easy for me."""
593,00:39:18.12,00:39:18.12,"And I'm like, ""This is not easy for me,"" you know."
594,00:39:20.29,00:39:20.29,"But the challenges, I live for those."
595,00:39:22.71,00:39:22.71,That's what keeps me going every day.
596,00:39:24.88,00:39:24.88,">> PROBST: Once again, you guys are in a position of trying to"
597,00:39:27.58,00:39:27.58,"adjust tribe dynamics, and you're going to do it by"
598,00:39:30.75,00:39:30.75,getting rid of somebody. It is time to vote.
599,00:39:32.62,00:39:32.62,"Erik, you're up. I'll go tally the votes."
600,00:40:22.50,00:40:22.50,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
601,00:40:25.29,00:40:25.29,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
602,00:40:27.25,00:40:27.25,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
603,00:40:31.46,00:40:31.46,"First vote, Dave. Sherea."
604,00:40:40.08,00:40:40.08,"One vote Dave, one vote Sherea. Dave."
605,00:40:46.04,00:40:46.04,"Two votes Dave, one vote Sherea. Dave."
606,00:40:52.58,00:40:52.58,"Three votes Dave, one vote Sherea."
607,00:40:58.17,00:40:58.17,"Fourth person voted out of Survivor: China, Dave."
608,00:41:01.62,00:41:01.62,"That's four, it's enough. You need to bring me your"
609,00:41:03.21,00:41:03.21,"torch. Dave, the tribe has spoken."
610,00:41:17.25,00:41:17.25,"Time for you to go. >> PROBST: Well, it's clear from"
611,00:41:33.21,00:41:33.21,tonight's vote that you weren't happy with the way things were
612,00:41:35.54,00:41:35.54,going at camp. I hope that means there's a new
613,00:41:37.79,00:41:37.79,plan in place. Because you're going to need
614,00:41:40.92,00:41:40.92,one. You're now two members down.
615,00:41:43.38,00:41:43.38,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
616,00:41:45.58,00:41:45.58,Good night. Stay tuned for scenes from our
617,00:42:05.04,00:42:05.04,next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on

619,00:42:12.33,00:42:12.33,>> PROBST: Jaime and Erik explore new territory.
620,00:42:14.50,00:42:14.50,>> I don't know what's going to happen with Jaime and I.
621,00:42:17.12,00:42:17.12,I'm a virgin. >> PROBST: And a twist...

628,00:42:35.46,00:42:35.46,At least I did it with conviction and integrity.
629,00:42:37.88,00:42:37.88,I thought I was humble. And I thought I listened.
630,00:42:40.71,00:42:40.71,I wish that some people perhaps listened to me a little
631,00:42:42.79,00:42:42.79,bit more. And I know there are pieces of
632,00:42:44.92,00:42:44.92,"me that are worth a lot, perhaps even priceless, you"
