1,00:00:01.17,00:00:01.17,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor:
2,00:00:02.37,00:00:02.37, The two tribes were brought together
3,00:00:04.47,00:00:04.47, for some important news.
4,00:00:05.83,00:00:05.83,"Today, the tribes will mergeinto one final tribe."
5,00:00:09.43,00:00:09.43,Oh!
6,00:00:10.93,00:00:10.93,PROBST:Jaburu and Tambaqui are no more.
7,00:00:13.80,00:00:13.80," At the new Jacaré tribe, Roger assumed"
8,00:00:15.70,00:00:15.70, it was still a battle of the sexes.
9,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57,"Everything is fallinginto place,"
10,00:00:19.60,00:00:19.60,exactly like we planned it.
11,00:00:20.83,00:00:20.83," We got six guys and four girls, you know?"
12,00:00:23.87,00:00:23.87,"It should be,just pick 'em off."
13,00:00:25.73,00:00:25.73,PROBST: But Deena and Rob led Jaburu
14,00:00:27.00,00:00:27.00, in a plan to take out the Tambaqui men.
15,00:00:29.63,00:00:29.63,"-We're down with Jaburu, right?-Hell, yeah."
16,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,Game is mine.
17,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,"Dave, Roger, Butch."
18,00:00:35.33,00:00:35.33," It is not the battle  of the sexes anymore,"
19,00:00:38.23,00:00:38.23, but it's the battle ofthe weaker versus the stronger.
20,00:00:41.17,00:00:41.17,"PROBST: At the first individual immunity challenge,"
21,00:00:42.97,00:00:42.97, it was Deena who stood victorious.
22,00:00:44.97,00:00:44.97,"All right, Deena!"
23,00:00:46.73,00:00:46.73,PROBST:Deena wins immunity.
24,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00,"-Congratulations.-All right, Deena!"
25,00:00:51.03,00:00:51.03,"PROBST: At Tribal Council, a surprised Roger"
26,00:00:52.73,00:00:52.73, was the first person voted out of the new Jacaré tribe.
27,00:00:56.70,00:00:56.70,"Roger, the tribe has spoken."
28,00:01:00.33,00:01:00.33, Nine are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
29,00:02:20.03,00:02:20.03,DEENA: We do havea lasting memory of Roger.
30,00:02:22.27,00:02:22.27,(laughs) Can we hang them upon the flagpole?
31,00:02:25.03,00:02:25.03,R.I.P.
32,00:02:26.47,00:02:26.47,"No, we... we need to put them,like, in the tree or something."
33,00:02:29.13,00:02:29.13,"Yeah, that... that's..."
34,00:02:30.90,00:02:30.90,"(humming ""Taps"")"
35,00:02:36.27,00:02:36.27,DEENA: Roger was this
36,00:02:37.93,00:02:37.93,"sexist, arrogant man,"
37,00:02:41.47,00:02:41.47," and once Roger left,"
38,00:02:43.43,00:02:43.43," it makes for a lighter, happier tribe."
39,00:02:45.77,00:02:45.77,"-(laughing)-No, that was flat."
40,00:02:47.93,00:02:47.93,Sorry.
41,00:02:49.43,00:02:49.43,I haven't tuned my buglein a couple weeks.
42,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70,DEENA: I feel fairly in control at this point in time.
43,00:02:55.73,00:02:55.73,"My panties are still on fire,and I'm going 120 miles an hour,"
44,00:02:58.40,00:02:58.40,but I feel pretty in control.
45,00:02:59.80,00:02:59.80,(laughter)
46,00:03:02.07,00:03:02.07,DAVE: What happened last night
47,00:03:03.90,00:03:03.90, was an interesting turn of events.
48,00:03:06.60,00:03:06.60,It is a prime examplethat nobody really knows
49,00:03:09.97,00:03:09.97,what's going on in this game.
50,00:03:11.83,00:03:11.83, I think that all my stability and everything
51,00:03:15.37,00:03:15.37," has now been turned upside down,"
52,00:03:18.07,00:03:18.07, because I did put my roots into an alliance with Roger.
53,00:03:22.20,00:03:22.20, Now...
54,00:03:23.53,00:03:23.53,we gotta play the game
55,00:03:25.00,00:03:25.00,according to howthings are right now.
56,00:03:30.07,00:03:30.07,We have to go outat least past the tree.
57,00:03:34.47,00:03:34.47,"We pull the boat in straight,along parallel"
58,00:03:36.70,00:03:36.70,-to these trees.-Mm-hmm.
59,00:03:38.07,00:03:38.07,BUTCH: Dave and I are getting ready to build a dock.
60,00:03:40.20,00:03:40.20," Uh, just a little courtesy"
61,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57,for everybody here at camp.
62,00:03:43.20,00:03:43.20,"So feet don't get wetand your shoes don't get wet,"
63,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,"'cause once they're wet,that's..."
64,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,your feet are miserable.
65,00:03:47.70,00:03:47.70,Let's go...let's go get four logs
66,00:03:49.20,00:03:49.20,-and see what they look like.-Okay. Yeah.
67,00:04:04.67,00:04:04.67,"See, it's going to be caughtup top."
68,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,"All right, I'm clear."
69,00:04:15.43,00:04:15.43,All right.
70,00:04:25.80,00:04:25.80,Is that one treethat would be as comparable
71,00:04:29.37,00:04:29.37,than this onethat's 20 feet off the ground?
72,00:04:31.77,00:04:31.77,"DEENA: Hey, that'skind of funny, actually."
73,00:04:33.60,00:04:33.60,ROB: I've had an ax to grind
74,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,with Dave for so long.
75,00:04:36.67,00:04:36.67,He thinks he's the... thesmartest guy in the whole world.
76,00:04:40.33,00:04:40.33," He's Mr. Adventure, Mr. Personality."
77,00:04:42.00,00:04:42.00, All the girls want to get with him.
78,00:04:46.40,00:04:46.40, I can't take any more.
79,00:04:47.77,00:04:47.77," He's a show-off, and he's arrogant."
80,00:04:51.07,00:04:51.07,Boo-yah.
81,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,ROB: Dave's got to go. He's a threat.
82,00:04:55.03,00:04:55.03," The main alliance right now is myself,"
83,00:04:57.53,00:04:57.53," Deena, Jenna, Heidi and Alex, which are the five people"
84,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17, that I would most like to spend my time with here.
85,00:05:08.83,00:05:08.83,ALEX: We all know that...
86,00:05:10.33,00:05:10.33,"if he doesn't win immunity,he goes home."
87,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,Mm-hmm.
88,00:05:15.37,00:05:15.37,"DAVE: I have approached this game with a mentality of,"
89,00:05:17.93,00:05:17.93," ""I am going to be me,"" and what you get"
90,00:05:20.07,00:05:20.07," is going to be Dave Johnson, no matter what."
91,00:05:22.07,00:05:22.07," And, uh, I think I've been on good terms with everybody,"
92,00:05:24.90,00:05:24.90," and hopefully, just being"
93,00:05:26.33,00:05:26.33,"a hard worker, and dedicated,motivated and fun to be with"
94,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"will keep me aroundfor a little bit longer,"
95,00:05:31.83,00:05:31.83," and start building, uh, some alliances"
96,00:05:33.37,00:05:33.37, with the people who are left.
97,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,That is not bad at all.
98,00:05:37.03,00:05:37.03,-I like it.-I like it.
99,00:05:42.23,00:05:42.23,(metallic scraping)
100,00:05:56.50,00:05:56.50,ROB: The craziest man I've ever met
101,00:05:59.23,00:05:59.23, has been living with me
102,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93,"24 hours a day, nonstop."
103,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,"DEENA: Is anybody else disturbedwith the fact that, uh,"
104,00:06:05.57,00:06:05.57,"Matthew is, uh, concentratingso hard on this?"
105,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,"Ah, just doing..."
106,00:06:10.20,00:06:10.20,"Yeah, are you going to butcherus all there?"
107,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,"I promise I won't, uh,harm anyone."
108,00:06:17.20,00:06:17.20,"I'm a pacifist, guys."
109,00:06:19.70,00:06:19.70,"Blood scares me, too."
110,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,I don't like the sight of blood.
111,00:06:22.97,00:06:22.97,"I mean, human blood,my own blood-- blah."
112,00:06:26.73,00:06:26.73,CHRISTY: Matt is creepy.
113,00:06:29.03,00:06:29.03,"Um, he's just creepy."
114,00:06:30.53,00:06:30.53,He's creepy.
115,00:06:32.37,00:06:32.37,"All right, once again,he is sharpening his machete."
116,00:06:34.73,00:06:34.73,I know.
117,00:06:37.83,00:06:37.83,ROB: He sits and sharpens the machete for an hour at a time.
118,00:06:41.10,00:06:41.10,Why does he need the macheteso sharp?
119,00:06:43.20,00:06:43.20,I think he's going to kill us.
120,00:06:47.37,00:06:47.37," I'm afraid that, when he is voted off,"
121,00:06:49.00,00:06:49.00, that he may take out the machete
122,00:06:51.23,00:06:51.23, and then kill us after the vote.
123,00:06:54.43,00:06:54.43,ALEX: There's a couple reasons
124,00:06:56.47,00:06:56.47,why it might be a good moveto vote for Matthew.
125,00:06:58.60,00:06:58.60,"One, he is a physical threat,"
126,00:07:00.17,00:07:00.17," and two, he's kind of losing it out here."
127,00:07:03.17,00:07:03.17, I don't know-- everyone's feeling it.
128,00:07:05.53,00:07:05.53, There's just kind of a weird vibe
129,00:07:06.97,00:07:06.97," coming from Matt these days,"
130,00:07:08.20,00:07:08.20, and nobody is all that comfortable around him.
131,00:07:20.33,00:07:20.33,"Come on in, guys!"
132,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,Okay.
133,00:07:26.97,00:07:26.97,"For today's challenge,it is for individual reward."
134,00:07:29.73,00:07:29.73,"However, it'll be playedin two rounds."
135,00:07:32.43,00:07:32.43,The first round will be playedin teams of three.
136,00:07:36.27,00:07:36.27,"Behind me is a pool of mudwith colored flags,"
137,00:07:38.17,00:07:38.17,one colored flag for each team.
138,00:07:39.53,00:07:39.53,Each team will be beltedto a bungee.
139,00:07:42.37,00:07:42.37,Your job: collect your team'srow of five flags.
140,00:07:45.50,00:07:45.50,"Obviously,the further away the flag,"
141,00:07:47.80,00:07:47.80,"the more resistancefrom the bungee,"
142,00:07:49.13,00:07:49.13,so the last flags will behardest to reach.
143,00:07:51.40,00:07:51.40,First team of three to get
144,00:07:52.63,00:07:52.63,all five flagsback in their flag slot
145,00:07:55.97,00:07:55.97,moves on to the final round.
146,00:07:57.43,00:07:57.43,"For the final round,the winning team of three"
147,00:07:59.27,00:07:59.27,"will now competeagainst each other,"
148,00:08:01.33,00:08:01.33,with the goal being to retrieve
149,00:08:02.87,00:08:02.87,"three flags, in order,closest to furthest."
150,00:08:06.07,00:08:06.07,First person back
151,00:08:07.07,00:08:07.07,with all three flagswins reward.
152,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,Want to knowwhat you're playing for?
153,00:08:10.70,00:08:10.70,-Yes.-Absolutely.
154,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,PROBST:Here's the reward.
155,00:08:13.40,00:08:13.40,It'll be an afternoonof refreshment.
156,00:08:15.50,00:08:15.50,"-Oh, my God.-You will have a chance"
157,00:08:16.73,00:08:16.73,to take a nice cool bath--cold water--
158,00:08:19.77,00:08:19.77,"lay back and get clean,"
159,00:08:22.03,00:08:22.03,"and then whenever you're ready,a banana split..."
160,00:08:24.33,00:08:24.33,"Oh, my God!"
161,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,"-...and chocolate syrup...-Oh, my God."

163,00:08:28.70,00:08:28.70,"...strawberries and cream,and it'll all be there for you."
164,00:08:31.13,00:08:31.13,"-All right. -All right, we'regonna draw for teams right here."
165,00:08:35.70,00:08:35.70,"Okay, Christy, Rob, and Butchare on the green team."

197,00:10:11.47,00:10:11.47,Starting to take its toll.

199,00:10:15.20,00:10:15.20,These last two are goingto be very tough.

299,00:15:26.43,00:15:26.43,(both laugh)
300,00:15:28.57,00:15:28.57,"And, and while it is fantasticthat I have made the jury,"
301,00:15:31.57,00:15:31.57,it would be nice to stick aroundanother couple days
302,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,because I'm having a good time.
303,00:15:36.43,00:15:36.43,Okay.
304,00:15:38.43,00:15:38.43,"All right,so here is the problem."

310,00:15:51.13,00:15:51.13,so you're the greatest threatto everybody.
311,00:15:52.77,00:15:52.77,I know.
312,00:15:54.10,00:15:54.10,"And the only way to do it is,is that if, uh, uh,"
313,00:15:57.50,00:15:57.50,we acceleratethe 5150 status of Matthew.
314,00:16:01.17,00:16:01.17,Yeah.
315,00:16:02.70,00:16:02.70,Which has been discussedbecause he's getting funky.
316,00:16:06.07,00:16:06.07,"Yeah, I mean, I'm just tryingto, t-to salvage myself,"
317,00:16:08.97,00:16:08.97,to stick aroundas long as possible.
318,00:16:10.40,00:16:10.40,I know and I understand.
319,00:16:12.67,00:16:12.67,I'll see what I can do.
320,00:16:14.67,00:16:14.67,I'll talk to them.
321,00:16:16.20,00:16:16.20,I owe you that for letting mehave a bath with you.
322,00:16:30.57,00:16:30.57,JENNA: This isDave's third time eating.
323,00:16:33.53,00:16:33.53,This is Dave's second shower.

325,00:16:35.97,00:16:35.97,Yeah.
326,00:16:37.20,00:16:37.20,Let me put on my bathing suitwhile I'm here.
327,00:16:39.70,00:16:39.70,"I was thinking that--yeah, where are you going to go,"
328,00:16:41.23,00:16:41.23,-behind the tree?-Yeah.
329,00:16:42.70,00:16:42.70,ALEX: If you guys needany help washing up...
330,00:16:44.07,00:16:44.07,JENNA: You'll be the personalwashing machine?
331,00:16:45.57,00:16:45.57,ALEX: I-I will bemore than happy to help.
332,00:16:47.57,00:16:47.57,So just holler.
333,00:16:49.60,00:16:49.60,HEIDI: We just got back from...
334,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,HEIDI AND JENNA: ...reward challenge.
335,00:16:53.00,00:16:53.00,Sucky reward challenge.
336,00:16:54.27,00:16:54.27,-Terrible banana split loserreward challenge. -Yeah.
337,00:16:57.63,00:16:57.63,JENNA: We've been talkingabout ice cream for the past...
338,00:16:59.23,00:16:59.23,JENNA AND HEIDI: Since day two.
339,00:17:00.63,00:17:00.63,"JENNA: Banana splits specifically,"
340,00:17:01.97,00:17:01.97," and today we lost it, but, oh, well."
341,00:17:05.30,00:17:05.30,-Yeah.-We don't need the fat anyway.
342,00:17:06.93,00:17:06.93,"-Yeah, exactly.-(laughs)"
343,00:17:11.73,00:17:11.73,JENNA:So I definitely think
344,00:17:12.93,00:17:12.93,it was a tactical movethat he took Deena.
345,00:17:16.60,00:17:16.60,"-No doubt about it.-No, I definitely think so, too."
346,00:17:18.00,00:17:18.00,I don't think it's gonna work.
347,00:17:19.23,00:17:19.23, I just hope they don't come back
348,00:17:21.23,00:17:21.23,and talk about their bananasplit for the whole night.
349,00:17:22.87,00:17:22.87,I-I'm going to ask them not to'cause that-that's killer.
350,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,I seriously am goingto ask them not to.
351,00:17:27.83,00:17:27.83,(Jenna mutters)
352,00:17:29.20,00:17:29.20,ROB: Twigs and Sticks are
353,00:17:31.23,00:17:31.23,a nickname for Jenna and Heidi.
354,00:17:35.07,00:17:35.07, Their legs are twigs and sticks.
355,00:17:37.73,00:17:37.73,I know that I certainlywould catch on fire
356,00:17:39.33,00:17:39.33,if I ever saw Twigs and Sticksrubbing together.
357,00:17:41.23,00:17:41.23,JENNA:We got whipped today.
358,00:17:44.23,00:17:44.23,"-HEIDI: Yeah, so bad.-Yeah."
359,00:17:45.37,00:17:45.37,And that's just impossible.
360,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,"ROB: I really like my alliance with Twigs and Sticks,"
361,00:17:50.77,00:17:50.77," but as much as I appreciate Jenna and Heidi's company,"
362,00:17:55.03,00:17:55.03,I don't know if eitherof those girls would pay me
363,00:17:58.00,00:17:58.00,any attention in real life.
364,00:17:59.77,00:17:59.77,Super itchy.
365,00:18:01.40,00:18:01.40,ROB: And I don't ever forget that fact.
366,00:18:02.83,00:18:02.83, I am aware of how they're trying to use
367,00:18:05.93,00:18:05.93, their sexuality to get me to do things that I wouldn't
368,00:18:08.80,00:18:08.80, normally do and make mistakes that I wouldn't normally make.
369,00:18:12.27,00:18:12.27,"I really do play this gamewith this head,"
370,00:18:14.40,00:18:14.40,"even though it does, today, look"
371,00:18:16.67,00:18:16.67, like a different head.
372,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,"Honey, we're home."
373,00:18:26.53,00:18:26.53,Hi.Was it fun?
374,00:18:28.37,00:18:28.37,"Yeah, it was fun."
375,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,"It was, it was a dumbed-downbungalow type place."
376,00:18:33.80,00:18:33.80,DEENA:How was your afternoon?
377,00:18:35.23,00:18:35.23,ROB:We did-- we ate lunch.
378,00:18:37.07,00:18:37.07,I was just getting readyto make dinner.
379,00:18:38.47,00:18:38.47,"Good, I'm hungry."
380,00:18:40.00,00:18:40.00,"ROB: When Dave and Deena cameback from the reward challenge,"
381,00:18:44.03,00:18:44.03,they started talkingabout how hungry they were.
382,00:18:46.83,00:18:46.83,"No, I'm hungry,Jenna, I'm hungry."
383,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,I want some manioc.
384,00:18:50.33,00:18:50.33,"JENNA: I was like, ""Screw you,"
385,00:18:51.33,00:18:51.33,"""you fat pig."
386,00:18:52.67,00:18:52.67,"""You had ice cream all dayand we are starving"

388,00:18:57.03,00:18:57.03,I've been talking aboutbanana splits since day two.
389,00:18:58.70,00:18:58.70,I wanted to cut myselfwith a machete
390,00:19:00.17,00:19:00.17,-when we were walking back.-The banana split
391,00:19:01.40,00:19:01.40,"wasn't really ""a banana split."""
392,00:19:03.90,00:19:03.90,It was more...
393,00:19:05.43,00:19:05.43,-But it was ice cream.-...two bananas
394,00:19:06.93,00:19:06.93,"in a bowl, and then it had--you know, there was"
395,00:19:10.93,00:19:10.93,-a couple little condiments.-Ice cream on it.
396,00:19:12.43,00:19:12.43,It wasn't very much ice cream...and it was all melted.
397,00:19:16.93,00:19:16.93,JENNA: Wasn't so much Deena; it was Dave.
398,00:19:18.90,00:19:18.90, Common courtesy would say since you just ate
399,00:19:21.57,00:19:21.57," three different types ofice creams, you would come back"
400,00:19:24.40,00:19:24.40, to your camp from people who have been eating manioc
401,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17, and let them eat the fish.
402,00:19:27.47,00:19:27.47,But I guesshe doesn't realize that.
403,00:19:37.97,00:19:37.97,(chittering)
404,00:19:40.40,00:19:40.40,(snoring)
405,00:19:51.80,00:19:51.80,ROB: I haven't spoken with Heidi
406,00:19:53.67,00:19:53.67," about her relationship with Dave, but I do"
407,00:19:56.37,00:19:56.37," sleep right next to them,"
408,00:19:57.90,00:19:57.90,and I know that I heara lot of rustling around

621,00:28:38.30,00:28:38.30,Take a step back.

701,00:32:56.47,00:32:56.47," a bit too close to the fire, so they're impossible to wear."
702,00:33:02.20,00:33:02.20,My objective for this afternoon
703,00:33:04.60,00:33:04.60,is to MacGyver theseinto suitable sandals.

706,00:33:19.40,00:33:19.40,"CHRISTY: I'd vote off Matt because,"

708,00:33:24.03,00:33:24.03," And he just gives me the creeps,"
709,00:33:25.47,00:33:25.47,"and I don't know how longI can, like, be around him."
710,00:33:34.87,00:33:34.87,DAVE: I am going to vote for Matt tonight because...
711,00:33:37.97,00:33:37.97,it's the only way that I canstay on for another three days.
712,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,"And, hopefully, my voteand a couple other people's"
713,00:33:45.77,00:33:45.77,will... will be enough
714,00:33:47.13,00:33:47.13,to get the majorityof votes against Matt.
715,00:33:49.93,00:33:49.93,-If I can get one moreout of you guys... -Right.
716,00:33:53.80,00:33:53.80,"as, you know--and really, I mean, it's..."

718,00:33:57.70,00:33:57.70,"Two things workingagainst you, though."
719,00:34:00.47,00:34:00.47,"One was, you know, Roger--obvious."
720,00:34:04.30,00:34:04.30,"-Right. -The other is, I mean,you're a threat, dude."
721,00:34:07.27,00:34:07.27,You're a ... badass.
722,00:34:08.50,00:34:08.50,-Nobody wants to ... aroundwith you. -I know.
723,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,ALEX: I am voting for Dave tonight.
724,00:34:13.80,00:34:13.80, He's probably the single biggest
725,00:34:15.43,00:34:15.43, threat out here right now.
726,00:34:16.83,00:34:16.83,I'd rather not competeagainst him anymore.
727,00:34:19.30,00:34:19.30,So what's Heidi thinkingabout this whole thing?
728,00:34:20.80,00:34:20.80,"What, you mean, like, about..."
729,00:34:21.87,00:34:21.87,"-about, like, Dave?-'Cause I..."

733,00:34:27.97,00:34:27.97,"that-that, uh... that-that Dave"
734,00:34:30.27,00:34:30.27,and Heidiwere in a full embrace?
735,00:34:33.20,00:34:33.20,Dave always embraces Heidi.
736,00:34:35.50,00:34:35.50,"I don't know how she feelsabout him, personally."
737,00:34:39.07,00:34:39.07,"DAVE: It's either me or Matt,"
738,00:34:40.37,00:34:40.37,"and, uh, I'd like to go..."
739,00:34:43.30,00:34:43.30,I'd like to go three more days.
740,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,"I would like for youto go three more days,"
741,00:34:48.00,00:34:48.00,especially compared to Matt.(chuckles)
742,00:34:49.43,00:34:49.43,"I think... honestly, I thinkDeena feels the same way I do."
743,00:34:52.63,00:34:52.63,-Deena does.-I think she really does.
744,00:34:55.13,00:34:55.13,But that's only three people.
745,00:34:56.73,00:34:56.73,I need two more.
746,00:34:58.57,00:34:58.57,"I don't know. I... seriously,"
747,00:34:59.80,00:34:59.80,I think you standa 50-50 chance right now.
748,00:35:01.80,00:35:01.80,-I have a 50-50 chance.-You do.
749,00:35:03.27,00:35:03.27,"-And, uh... -And that's the wayI'd look at it."
750,00:35:05.00,00:35:05.00,So...
751,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,"PROBST:Hello, guys."
752,00:35:56.40,00:35:56.40,Hey.
753,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,Let's talk abouthow people are fitting in now.
754,00:35:59.87,00:35:59.87,"Matthew, in the past, when wetalked about fitting in,"
755,00:36:03.03,00:36:03.03,"you were pretty honestin saying,"
756,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"""I haven't totally fit in."""
757,00:36:06.87,00:36:06.87,Has that changed?
758,00:36:08.10,00:36:08.10,"It's completely changed,actually."
759,00:36:09.80,00:36:09.80,"When we merged hereand, uh, started to spend"
760,00:36:13.03,00:36:13.03,"more time together,I found that, uh, people"
761,00:36:16.00,00:36:16.00,were a lot more interestedin what I had to say.
762,00:36:19.00,00:36:19.00,"I feel like I havesome true friends,"
763,00:36:21.83,00:36:21.83,and I feel like we have
764,00:36:23.10,00:36:23.10,"some great, uh, genuine,uh, relationships."
765,00:36:26.27,00:36:26.27,"Rob, a lot of facial expressionsduring that answer."
766,00:36:29.53,00:36:29.53,I'm just so happywith Matthew's progress.
767,00:36:32.27,00:36:32.27,I was with Matthew for the first
768,00:36:34.33,00:36:34.33,"14 days of this gameat Tambaqui,"
769,00:36:36.53,00:36:36.53,"and he really was kind of, uh,secluded to himself,"
770,00:36:40.40,00:36:40.40,"and now I think that he's fit inso well now,"
771,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27,and he really has become
772,00:36:45.53,00:36:45.53,an invaluable partof this tribe.
773,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,"Heidi, let's talkabout the immunity challenge."
774,00:36:50.27,00:36:50.27,There really was no hidingwhat was going on.
775,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,It's designed to let people know
776,00:36:55.80,00:36:55.80,where they standwithin the tribe.
777,00:36:57.50,00:36:57.50,What was your thoughtson how that game played out?
778,00:36:59.77,00:36:59.77,I thought itwas really interesting
779,00:37:02.23,00:37:02.23,that the four girls(chuckles)
780,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,were the last ones left.
781,00:37:07.40,00:37:07.40,"Um, I really didn't expect thatto happen, like, whatsoever."
782,00:37:10.40,00:37:10.40,"The guys pretty mucheliminated themselves,"
783,00:37:14.10,00:37:14.10,instead of workingagainst the girls.
784,00:37:16.43,00:37:16.43,"PROBST: And Matthew,on the other hand,"
785,00:37:17.73,00:37:17.73,"you were the first onetaken out of the challenge,"
786,00:37:19.73,00:37:19.73,followed closely by Dave.
787,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,That's got to tell you somethingabout what people
788,00:37:24.40,00:37:24.40,-are thinking about you.-MATTHEW: No kidding.
789,00:37:25.93,00:37:25.93,"I-I-I wasn't very happywhere I fell,"
790,00:37:27.77,00:37:27.77,"but hey, that's the waythe ball bounces."
791,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,"PROBST:Dave, same question."
792,00:37:31.57,00:37:31.57,Why do you thinkyou were taken out?
793,00:37:32.93,00:37:32.93,"You, know it is a game."
794,00:37:34.13,00:37:34.13,"It's an individual gameat this point,"
795,00:37:35.50,00:37:35.50,"and, uh, a group of peoplemight see me as a threat"
796,00:37:38.63,00:37:38.63,"and, uh, therefore want toget me out as soon as possible."
797,00:37:41.63,00:37:41.63,I am in a precariousposition right now.
798,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"I know that... that my namewill come up tonight,"
799,00:37:46.30,00:37:46.30,"and hopefully, it won'tbe the majority,"
800,00:37:49.63,00:37:49.63,but... but we'll see.
801,00:37:50.90,00:37:50.90,"These next three days are...are important to me,"
802,00:37:53.73,00:37:53.73,"and, um, I would liketo spend them"
803,00:37:55.90,00:37:55.90,with the... the eight people
804,00:37:57.07,00:37:57.07,that are sitting down herein front of me.
805,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,"PROBST: Deena, can a obviouslyheartfelt plea like that"
806,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"ever sway a vote,if indeed that vote"
807,00:38:05.97,00:38:05.97,is already heading Dave's way?
808,00:38:07.77,00:38:07.77,If I've learned anything
809,00:38:09.10,00:38:09.10,"during the courseof my lifetime,"
810,00:38:10.80,00:38:10.80,"human emotion can be dictatedby human sentiment,"
811,00:38:14.43,00:38:14.43,and I absolutely think there'speople who had question marks
812,00:38:17.03,00:38:17.03,"in their head and said,""All right,"
813,00:38:18.70,00:38:18.70,"""well, I told these peopleI would,"
814,00:38:20.23,00:38:20.23,"""but, oh, gosh,"
815,00:38:21.97,00:38:21.97,"he... it's just...I just can't do it tonight."""
816,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,So... so yes.
817,00:38:26.27,00:38:26.27,"PROBST: Jenna, you haveimmunity around your neck."
818,00:38:28.90,00:38:28.90,"If you feel comfortable enoughwithin the tribe,"
819,00:38:31.63,00:38:31.63,you could offer it to anyoneelse in exchange for something.
820,00:38:34.87,00:38:34.87,I couldn't see anything thatcould be exchanged for immunity.
821,00:38:38.23,00:38:38.23,"It's mine,and I'm going to keep it."
822,00:38:39.57,00:38:39.57,PROBST:All right.
823,00:38:40.80,00:38:40.80,"Well, as we have clearlyillustrated tonight,"
824,00:38:43.60,00:38:43.60,"at this point,the game definitely changes,"
825,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23,because you are no longerjust voting people out;
826,00:38:48.60,00:38:48.60,you're voting people outwho you're then going to ask
827,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,to come backas a member of a jury
828,00:38:52.80,00:38:52.80,"and decide, ultimately,who will be the sole survivor."
829,00:38:56.43,00:38:56.43,"It is time to vote.Deena, you're up."
830,00:39:23.20,00:39:23.20,He's a great guy.
831,00:39:24.73,00:39:24.73,"Really enjoy his company, but..."
832,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33, his time has come.
833,00:39:53.30,00:39:53.30,We've been honestwith each other since day one.
834,00:39:55.90,00:39:55.90,"Think it's interestinghow both, I guess,"
835,00:39:58.47,00:39:58.47,"perceived physical powerhousesare now dueling it,"
836,00:40:01.27,00:40:01.27, one for one-- it has to come down to this.
837,00:40:03.50,00:40:03.50, I hope it's you and not me.
838,00:40:05.00,00:40:05.00,Nothing personal. Take care.
839,00:40:18.93,00:40:18.93,"I have total, total respect"
840,00:40:20.73,00:40:20.73,for everythingyou've done in this game.
841,00:40:22.33,00:40:22.33, You've played it well. You've played it hard.
842,00:40:24.53,00:40:24.53, Those are reasons we have to get you out.
843,00:40:33.70,00:40:33.70,I'll go tally the votes.
844,00:40:44.43,00:40:44.43,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
845,00:40:46.57,00:40:46.57,Person voted outwill be asked
846,00:40:47.83,00:40:47.83,to leave the Tribal Councilarea immediately.
847,00:40:49.60,00:40:49.60,I'll read the votes.
848,00:40:55.30,00:40:55.30,First vote.

850,00:41:04.00,00:41:04.00,Matt.
851,00:41:06.43,00:41:06.43,"One vote Dave, one vote Matt."
852,00:41:12.87,00:41:12.87,That's two votes Dave.
853,00:41:19.70,00:41:19.70,Three votes Dave.
854,00:41:24.67,00:41:24.67,Dave.That's four votes.

856,00:41:31.23,00:41:31.23,and the first memberof our jury: Dave.
857,00:41:34.23,00:41:34.23,That's five votes.That's enough.
858,00:41:36.40,00:41:36.40,Need to bring me your torch.
859,00:41:48.43,00:41:48.43,"Dave, the tribe has spoken."
860,00:42:07.63,00:42:07.63,"Well, clearly, this is a gameabout relationships."
861,00:42:11.50,00:42:11.50,"With only 15 days left,"
862,00:42:13.30,00:42:13.30,the questionyou have to be asking yourselves
863,00:42:16.00,00:42:16.00,"is: ""Are the relationshipsI formed out here genuine?"
864,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,"Can they get me to the end?"""
865,00:42:22.73,00:42:22.73,Something to think aboutas you head back to camp.
866,00:42:25.57,00:42:25.57,"Good night, guys."

870,00:42:50.17,00:42:50.17, -on the finger. -Ow! God. -How bad?
871,00:42:52.00,00:42:52.00," BUTCH: The fish was dead, and he had one last bite."
872,00:42:55.70,00:42:55.70,PROBST: And a power struggle erupts at Jacaré.
873,00:42:58.23,00:42:58.23,Deena thinks that she'spulling the strings.
874,00:43:01.13,00:43:01.13, Alex thinks that he's calling the shots.
875,00:43:03.77,00:43:03.77,Who's really calling the shots? Me.
876,00:43:11.53,00:43:11.53,I wish the bestfor everybody out there.
877,00:43:13.20,00:43:13.20," And I think, uh, you know, on closing terms,"
878,00:43:15.80,00:43:15.80," there's a great, uh, Nepalese saying that goes, uh..."
879,00:43:19.83,00:43:19.83," ""K garne neparne."""
880,00:43:22.77,00:43:22.77," It means, ""What to do?"""
881,00:43:24.77,00:43:24.77," And, uh, I'm here right now, and I'm hungry,"
882,00:43:27.40,00:43:27.40," and it's, uh, it's food time, so..."
