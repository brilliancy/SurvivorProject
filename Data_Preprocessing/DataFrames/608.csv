1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.17,00:00:01.17,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor:
3,00:00:02.37,00:00:02.37, The two tribes  were brought together
4,00:00:04.47,00:00:04.47, for some important news.
5,00:00:05.83,00:00:05.83,"Today, the tribes will merge into one final tribe."
6,00:00:09.43,00:00:09.43,Oh!
7,00:00:10.93,00:00:10.93,PROBST: Jaburu and Tambaqui are no more.
8,00:00:13.80,00:00:13.80," At the new Jacar\xc3\xa9 tribe,  Roger assumed"
9,00:00:15.70,00:00:15.70, it was still a battle  of the sexes.
10,00:00:18.57,00:00:18.57,"Everything is falling into place,"
11,00:00:19.60,00:00:19.60,exactly like we planned it.
12,00:00:20.83,00:00:20.83," We got six guys  and four girls, you know?"
13,00:00:23.87,00:00:23.87,"It should be, just pick 'em off."
14,00:00:25.73,00:00:25.73,PROBST:  But Deena and Rob led Jaburu
15,00:00:27.00,00:00:27.00, in a plan to take out  the Tambaqui men.
16,00:00:29.63,00:00:29.63,"-We're down with Jaburu, right? -Hell, yeah."
17,00:00:32.07,00:00:32.07,Game is mine.
18,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,"Dave, Roger, Butch."
19,00:00:35.33,00:00:35.33," It is not the battle   of the sexes anymore,"
20,00:00:38.23,00:00:38.23, but it's the battle of the weaker versus the stronger.
21,00:00:41.17,00:00:41.17,"PROBST: At the first  individual immunity challenge,"
22,00:00:42.97,00:00:42.97, it was Deena  who stood victorious.
23,00:00:44.97,00:00:44.97,"All right, Deena!"
24,00:00:46.73,00:00:46.73,PROBST: Deena wins immunity.
25,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00,"-Congratulations. -All right, Deena!"
26,00:00:51.03,00:00:51.03,"PROBST: At Tribal Council,  a surprised Roger"
27,00:00:52.73,00:00:52.73, was the first person voted out  of the new Jacar\xc3\xa9 tribe.
28,00:00:56.70,00:00:56.70,"Roger, the tribe has spoken."
29,00:01:00.33,00:01:00.33, Nine are left.  Who will be voted out tonight?
30,00:02:20.03,00:02:20.03,DEENA: We do have a lasting memory of Roger.
31,00:02:22.27,00:02:22.27,(laughs) Can we hang them up on the flagpole?
32,00:02:25.03,00:02:25.03,R.I.P.
33,00:02:26.47,00:02:26.47,"No, we... we need to put them, like, in the tree or something."
34,00:02:29.13,00:02:29.13,"Yeah, that... that's..."
35,00:02:30.90,00:02:30.90,"(humming ""Taps"")"
36,00:02:36.27,00:02:36.27,DEENA:  Roger was this
37,00:02:37.93,00:02:37.93,"sexist, arrogant man,"
38,00:02:41.47,00:02:41.47," and once Roger left,"
39,00:02:43.43,00:02:43.43," it makes for a lighter,  happier tribe."
40,00:02:45.77,00:02:45.77,"-(laughing) -No, that was flat."
41,00:02:47.93,00:02:47.93,Sorry.
42,00:02:49.43,00:02:49.43,I haven't tuned my bugle in a couple weeks.
43,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70,DEENA: I feel fairly in control  at this point in time.
44,00:02:55.73,00:02:55.73,"My panties are still on fire, and I'm going 120 miles an hour,"
45,00:02:58.40,00:02:58.40,but I feel pretty in control.
46,00:02:59.80,00:02:59.80,(laughter)
47,00:03:02.07,00:03:02.07,DAVE:  What happened last night
48,00:03:03.90,00:03:03.90, was an interesting  turn of events.
49,00:03:06.60,00:03:06.60,It is a prime example that nobody really knows
50,00:03:09.97,00:03:09.97,what's going on in this game.
51,00:03:11.83,00:03:11.83, I think that all my stability  and everything
52,00:03:15.37,00:03:15.37," has now been  turned upside down,"
53,00:03:18.07,00:03:18.07, because I did put my roots  into an alliance with Roger.
54,00:03:22.20,00:03:22.20, Now...
55,00:03:23.53,00:03:23.53,we gotta play the game
56,00:03:25.00,00:03:25.00,according to how things are right now.
57,00:03:30.07,00:03:30.07,We have to go out at least past the tree.
58,00:03:34.47,00:03:34.47,"We pull the boat in straight, along parallel"
59,00:03:36.70,00:03:36.70,-to these trees. -Mm-hmm.
60,00:03:38.07,00:03:38.07,BUTCH: Dave and I are getting  ready to build a dock.
61,00:03:40.20,00:03:40.20," Uh, just a little courtesy"
62,00:03:41.57,00:03:41.57,for everybody here at camp.
63,00:03:43.20,00:03:43.20,"So feet don't get wet and your shoes don't get wet,"
64,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,"'cause once they're wet, that's..."
65,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,your feet are miserable.
66,00:03:47.70,00:03:47.70,Let's go... let's go get four logs
67,00:03:49.20,00:03:49.20,-and see what they look like. -Okay. Yeah.
68,00:04:04.67,00:04:04.67,"See, it's going to be caught up top."
69,00:04:12.87,00:04:12.87,"All right, I'm clear."
70,00:04:15.43,00:04:15.43,All right.
71,00:04:25.80,00:04:25.80,Is that one tree that would be as comparable
72,00:04:29.37,00:04:29.37,than this one that's 20 feet off the ground?
73,00:04:31.77,00:04:31.77,"DEENA: Hey, that's kind of funny, actually."
74,00:04:33.60,00:04:33.60,ROB:  I've had an ax to grind
75,00:04:35.17,00:04:35.17,with Dave for so long.
76,00:04:36.67,00:04:36.67,He thinks he's the... the smartest guy in the whole world.
77,00:04:40.33,00:04:40.33," He's Mr. Adventure,  Mr. Personality."
78,00:04:42.00,00:04:42.00, All the girls want  to get with him.
79,00:04:46.40,00:04:46.40, I can't take any more.
80,00:04:47.77,00:04:47.77," He's a show-off,  and he's arrogant."
81,00:04:51.07,00:04:51.07,Boo-yah.
82,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,ROB: Dave's got to go.  He's a threat.
83,00:04:55.03,00:04:55.03," The main alliance right now  is myself,"
84,00:04:57.53,00:04:57.53," Deena, Jenna, Heidi and Alex,  which are the five people"
85,00:05:01.17,00:05:01.17, that I would most like  to spend my time with here.
86,00:05:08.83,00:05:08.83,ALEX:  We all know that...
87,00:05:10.33,00:05:10.33,"if he doesn't win immunity, he goes home."
88,00:05:13.00,00:05:13.00,Mm-hmm.
89,00:05:15.37,00:05:15.37,"DAVE: I have approached  this game with a mentality of,"
90,00:05:17.93,00:05:17.93," ""I am going to be me,""  and what you get"
91,00:05:20.07,00:05:20.07," is going to be Dave Johnson,  no matter what."
92,00:05:22.07,00:05:22.07," And, uh, I think I've been  on good terms with everybody,"
93,00:05:24.90,00:05:24.90," and hopefully, just being"
94,00:05:26.33,00:05:26.33,"a hard worker, and dedicated, motivated and fun to be with"
95,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"will keep me around for a little bit longer,"
96,00:05:31.83,00:05:31.83," and start building, uh,  some alliances"
97,00:05:33.37,00:05:33.37, with the people who are left.
98,00:05:34.67,00:05:34.67,That is not bad at all.
99,00:05:37.03,00:05:37.03,-I like it. -I like it.
100,00:05:42.23,00:05:42.23,(metallic scraping)
101,00:05:56.50,00:05:56.50,ROB:  The craziest man I've ever met
102,00:05:59.23,00:05:59.23, has been living with me
103,00:06:00.93,00:06:00.93,"24 hours a day, nonstop."
104,00:06:03.40,00:06:03.40,"DEENA: Is anybody else disturbed with the fact that, uh,"
105,00:06:05.57,00:06:05.57,"Matthew is, uh, concentrating so hard on this?"
106,00:06:08.80,00:06:08.80,"Ah, just doing..."
107,00:06:10.20,00:06:10.20,"Yeah, are you going to butcher us all there?"
108,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,"I promise I won't, uh, harm anyone."
109,00:06:17.20,00:06:17.20,"I'm a pacifist, guys."
110,00:06:19.70,00:06:19.70,"Blood scares me, too."
111,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,I don't like the sight of blood.
112,00:06:22.97,00:06:22.97,"I mean, human blood, my own blood-- blah."
113,00:06:26.73,00:06:26.73,CHRISTY:  Matt is creepy.
114,00:06:29.03,00:06:29.03,"Um, he's just creepy."
115,00:06:30.53,00:06:30.53,He's creepy.
116,00:06:32.37,00:06:32.37,"All right, once again, he is sharpening his machete."
117,00:06:34.73,00:06:34.73,I know.
118,00:06:37.83,00:06:37.83,ROB: He sits and sharpens the  machete for an hour at a time.
119,00:06:41.10,00:06:41.10,Why does he need the machete so sharp?
120,00:06:43.20,00:06:43.20,I think he's going to kill us.
121,00:06:47.37,00:06:47.37," I'm afraid that,  when he is voted off,"
122,00:06:49.00,00:06:49.00, that he may take out  the machete
123,00:06:51.23,00:06:51.23, and then kill us  after the vote.
124,00:06:54.43,00:06:54.43,ALEX:  There's a couple reasons
125,00:06:56.47,00:06:56.47,why it might be a good move to vote for Matthew.
126,00:06:58.60,00:06:58.60,"One, he is a physical threat,"
127,00:07:00.17,00:07:00.17," and two, he's kind of  losing it out here."
128,00:07:03.17,00:07:03.17, I don't know--  everyone's feeling it.
129,00:07:05.53,00:07:05.53, There's just kind of  a weird vibe
130,00:07:06.97,00:07:06.97," coming from Matt these days,"
131,00:07:08.20,00:07:08.20, and nobody is all that  comfortable around him.
132,00:07:20.33,00:07:20.33,"Come on in, guys!"
133,00:07:24.97,00:07:24.97,Okay.
134,00:07:26.97,00:07:26.97,"For today's challenge, it is for individual reward."
135,00:07:29.73,00:07:29.73,"However, it'll be played in two rounds."
136,00:07:32.43,00:07:32.43,The first round will be played in teams of three.
137,00:07:36.27,00:07:36.27,"Behind me is a pool of mud with colored flags,"
138,00:07:38.17,00:07:38.17,one colored flag for each team.
139,00:07:39.53,00:07:39.53,Each team will be belted to a bungee.
140,00:07:42.37,00:07:42.37,Your job: collect your team's row of five flags.
141,00:07:45.50,00:07:45.50,"Obviously, the further away the flag,"
142,00:07:47.80,00:07:47.80,"the more resistance from the bungee,"
143,00:07:49.13,00:07:49.13,so the last flags will be hardest to reach.
144,00:07:51.40,00:07:51.40,First team of three to get
145,00:07:52.63,00:07:52.63,all five flags back in their flag slot
146,00:07:55.97,00:07:55.97,moves on to the final round.
147,00:07:57.43,00:07:57.43,"For the final round, the winning team of three"
148,00:07:59.27,00:07:59.27,"will now compete against each other,"
149,00:08:01.33,00:08:01.33,with the goal being to retrieve
150,00:08:02.87,00:08:02.87,"three flags, in order, closest to furthest."
151,00:08:06.07,00:08:06.07,First person back
152,00:08:07.07,00:08:07.07,with all three flags wins reward.
153,00:08:09.67,00:08:09.67,Want to know what you're playing for?
154,00:08:10.70,00:08:10.70,-Yes. -Absolutely.
155,00:08:11.70,00:08:11.70,PROBST: Here's the reward.
156,00:08:13.40,00:08:13.40,It'll be an afternoon of refreshment.
157,00:08:15.50,00:08:15.50,"-Oh, my God. -You will have a chance"
158,00:08:16.73,00:08:16.73,to take a nice cool bath-- cold water--
159,00:08:19.77,00:08:19.77,"lay back and get clean,"
160,00:08:22.03,00:08:22.03,"and then whenever you're ready, a banana split..."
161,00:08:24.33,00:08:24.33,"Oh, my God!"
162,00:08:25.43,00:08:25.43,"-...and chocolate syrup... -Oh, my God."
163,00:08:27.23,00:08:27.23,"-..brownie sundae... -Oh, my God. -Wow."
164,00:08:28.70,00:08:28.70,"...strawberries and cream, and it'll all be there for you."
165,00:08:31.13,00:08:31.13,"-All right. -All right, we're gonna draw for teams right here."
166,00:08:35.70,00:08:35.70,"Okay, Christy, Rob, and Butch are on the green team."
167,00:08:39.23,00:08:39.23,"Dave, Deena, Alex, you're purple."
168,00:08:40.80,00:08:40.80,"Jenna, Matt, and Heidi are orange."
169,00:08:43.40,00:08:43.40,For a great reward-- survivors ready...
170,00:08:45.93,00:08:45.93,Go!
171,00:08:51.60,00:08:51.60,Matthew has the first one.
172,00:08:52.87,00:08:52.87,Gotta get it back in the slot.
173,00:09:02.30,00:09:02.30,Moving on for number two.
174,00:09:04.60,00:09:04.60,"Matthew, Jenna, and Heidi in the lead."
175,00:09:06.20,00:09:06.20,"Pull 'em, Matthew, let's go, baby."
176,00:09:10.13,00:09:10.13,Alex gaining.
177,00:09:11.57,00:09:11.57,Matthew has number two.
178,00:09:14.30,00:09:14.30,Alex has number two.
179,00:09:16.77,00:09:16.77,Butch has number two.
180,00:09:18.73,00:09:18.73,That's right.
181,00:09:20.00,00:09:20.00,PROBST: We're very close right now.
182,00:09:21.73,00:09:21.73,"Let's go, guys."
183,00:09:25.87,00:09:25.87,Going to have to dig deep.
184,00:09:27.87,00:09:27.87,Dig deep.
185,00:09:29.00,00:09:29.00,Matthew and Jenna with a bit of a lead.
186,00:09:30.87,00:09:30.87,"Alex gaining, going for flag number three."
187,00:09:35.37,00:09:35.37,"Go, go, go."
188,00:09:38.10,00:09:38.10,"PROBST: Let's go, guys."
189,00:09:39.10,00:09:39.10,Butch and Rob in the tail.
190,00:09:40.10,00:09:40.10,Alex has it.
191,00:09:42.37,00:09:42.37,Matthew has it.
192,00:09:43.50,00:09:43.50,It's a race back.
193,00:09:54.30,00:09:54.30,Rob and Butch trying to pull Christy.
194,00:09:56.47,00:09:56.47,"Go, go, go."
195,00:10:00.83,00:10:00.83,"PROBST: Let's go, guys, cannot slow down."
196,00:10:05.67,00:10:05.67,Got it!
197,00:10:07.37,00:10:07.37,Rob finally gets the third flag.
198,00:10:11.47,00:10:11.47,Starting to take its toll.
199,00:10:14.10,00:10:14.10,Getting tougher and tougher.
200,00:10:15.20,00:10:15.20,These last two are going to be very tough.
201,00:10:17.77,00:10:17.77,"Come on, Deena."
202,00:10:21.60,00:10:21.60,Reaching for that fourth flag.
203,00:10:23.60,00:10:23.60,Alex has it.
204,00:10:31.10,00:10:31.10,"-Oh, my God. -PROBST: Matthew, Jenna, and Heidi getting closer."
205,00:10:33.47,00:10:33.47,Somebody grab it.
206,00:10:35.17,00:10:35.17,Matthew has his fourth flag.
207,00:10:38.30,00:10:38.30,You can make up time.
208,00:10:39.53,00:10:39.53,Let's go.
209,00:10:46.57,00:10:46.57,You guys are still in it.
210,00:10:48.83,00:10:48.83,"Matthew, dig deep."
211,00:10:49.90,00:10:49.90,"Let's go, this is it."
212,00:10:52.00,00:10:52.00,"Dave and Alex and Deena in the lead, going for that fifth flag,"
213,00:10:55.00,00:10:55.00,trying to move on to the final round.
214,00:10:57.83,00:10:57.83,The winning team moves on to the final.
215,00:11:02.63,00:11:02.63,"Butch and Rob, gallant effort."
216,00:11:05.73,00:11:05.73,(groaning)
217,00:11:07.43,00:11:07.43,"Don't look at them, guys."
218,00:11:08.80,00:11:08.80,"Dig, let's go."
219,00:11:12.27,00:11:12.27,Dave has their fifth flag.
220,00:11:14.17,00:11:14.17,Get it back in the slot and it's over.
221,00:11:17.07,00:11:17.07,Doing the backstroke.
222,00:11:23.80,00:11:23.80,"Dave, Alex, Deena, moving on to the final round."
223,00:11:28.70,00:11:28.70,"Going head to head-- Deena, Alex and Dave."

234,00:12:00.87,00:12:00.87,There it is.
235,00:12:06.17,00:12:06.17,"Just like that, it's over."
236,00:12:10.13,00:12:10.13,Dave wins reward.
237,00:12:12.73,00:12:12.73,-Nicely done. -Appreciate that.
238,00:12:14.67,00:12:14.67,So here's the deal.
239,00:12:16.03,00:12:16.03,Cold bath and then we have a banana split.
240,00:12:18.50,00:12:18.50,Oh!
241,00:12:19.87,00:12:19.87,But what is an afternoon spent alone?
242,00:12:23.37,00:12:23.37,"One person gets to come with you-- your choice, only one."
243,00:12:26.70,00:12:26.70,Gotta pick 'em now.
244,00:12:29.03,00:12:29.03,"Alex and Deena, ""one"" or ""two"" behind the back?"
245,00:12:33.73,00:12:33.73,(chuckles)
246,00:12:35.13,00:12:35.13,"-Go ahead, Deena. -Two."
247,00:12:36.67,00:12:36.67,One.
248,00:12:37.67,00:12:37.67,"Oh, oh!"
249,00:12:40.00,00:12:40.00,"-You got it, Deena. -I could kiss you."
250,00:12:42.97,00:12:42.97,"PROBST: All right, you guys are coming with me."
251,00:12:44.57,00:12:44.57,You guys are heading back to camp.
252,00:12:57.07,00:12:57.07,(screeching)
253,00:13:07.67,00:13:07.67,I think you're going to like what's been prepared for you.
254,00:13:16.37,00:13:16.37,Little afternoon hideaway for you two.
255,00:13:18.30,00:13:18.30,Separate his and her bathtubs with towels
256,00:13:22.37,00:13:22.37,"and everything you need,"
257,00:13:23.63,00:13:23.63,including bath balm-- those little white balls.
258,00:13:26.03,00:13:26.03,"And, uh, here's the food."
259,00:13:28.50,00:13:28.50,"You've got, as promised,"
260,00:13:31.20,00:13:31.20,"pitcher of ice tea, banana split."
261,00:13:33.73,00:13:33.73,"Also got, uh, strawberries and cream and brownie sundae."
262,00:13:37.57,00:13:37.57,DAVE: Wow.
263,00:13:39.57,00:13:39.57,"-It's your place, enjoy it. -The bomb. -Great."
264,00:13:41.33,00:13:41.33,"-All right, see you, guys. -Thank you."
265,00:13:43.97,00:13:43.97,"Well, I say we change plans,"
266,00:13:45.67,00:13:45.67,"-and do ice cream first. -Yes, let's eat."
267,00:13:49.30,00:13:49.30,"-Dave, thank you, oh. -(Dave laughs)"
268,00:13:53.13,00:13:53.13,DAVE: Wow.
269,00:13:56.97,00:13:56.97,Life could not be any better at all.
270,00:13:58.60,00:13:58.60,You have got to have some of this.
271,00:14:00.70,00:14:00.70,I am in strawberry bliss.
272,00:14:02.80,00:14:02.80,"Mmm, mmm!"
273,00:14:05.17,00:14:05.17,(Dave squeaking happily)
274,00:14:09.43,00:14:09.43,I'm feeling it.
275,00:14:11.73,00:14:11.73,Mmm.
276,00:14:13.47,00:14:13.47,"Excuse me, somebody slap me."
277,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,This is about the best thing in the world.
278,00:14:19.53,00:14:19.53,This is the best in the world.
279,00:14:22.67,00:14:22.67,I'm going to be ill.
280,00:14:23.83,00:14:23.83,-I am so ill. -(laughter)
281,00:14:37.30,00:14:37.30,(groans with pleasure)
282,00:14:39.03,00:14:39.03,"Oh, my goodness gracious."
283,00:14:41.53,00:14:41.53,How absolutely bitching is this?
284,00:14:44.03,00:14:44.03,This is so unbelievably cool.
285,00:14:46.03,00:14:46.03,-You know what? -What?
286,00:14:47.27,00:14:47.27,I've never used a loofah before in my life.
287,00:14:50.23,00:14:50.23,I would like you to loofah away.
288,00:14:52.23,00:14:52.23,I'm gonna loofah myself up.
289,00:14:53.90,00:14:53.90,(humming)
290,00:14:56.53,00:14:56.53,(both laughing)
291,00:14:58.67,00:14:58.67,Is this what you were talking about?
292,00:15:02.27,00:15:02.27,(both laughing)
293,00:15:05.30,00:15:05.30,The rocket scientist and the district attorney.
294,00:15:09.13,00:15:09.13,(both laughing)
295,00:15:13.47,00:15:13.47,"All right, here's my dilemma."
296,00:15:15.77,00:15:15.77,"It, it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out..."
297,00:15:20.33,00:15:20.33,-The writing on the... -...tha-tha-tha-that
298,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67,"in the proverbial, proverbial sense,"
299,00:15:24.83,00:15:24.83,I-I am quite (bleep).
300,00:15:26.43,00:15:26.43,(both laugh)
301,00:15:28.57,00:15:28.57,"And, and while it is fantastic that I have made the jury,"
302,00:15:31.57,00:15:31.57,it would be nice to stick around another couple days
303,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,because I'm having a good time.
304,00:15:36.43,00:15:36.43,Okay.
305,00:15:38.43,00:15:38.43,"All right, so here is the problem."
306,00:15:39.67,00:15:39.67,Yes.
307,00:15:41.10,00:15:41.10,(clears throat)
308,00:15:42.40,00:15:42.40,"I, I have absolutely no power to change the fate."
309,00:15:46.33,00:15:46.33,"You, of course, are the strongest person in the group"
310,00:15:49.07,00:15:49.07,"-as it is-- stands right now, -Yes."
311,00:15:51.13,00:15:51.13,so you're the greatest threat to everybody.
312,00:15:52.77,00:15:52.77,I know.
313,00:15:54.10,00:15:54.10,"And the only way to do it is, is that if, uh, uh,"
314,00:15:57.50,00:15:57.50,we accelerate the 5150 status of Matthew.
315,00:16:01.17,00:16:01.17,Yeah.
316,00:16:02.70,00:16:02.70,Which has been discussed because he's getting funky.
317,00:16:06.07,00:16:06.07,"Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying to, t-to salvage myself,"
318,00:16:08.97,00:16:08.97,to stick around as long as possible.
319,00:16:10.40,00:16:10.40,I know and I understand.
320,00:16:12.67,00:16:12.67,I'll see what I can do.
321,00:16:14.67,00:16:14.67,I'll talk to them.
322,00:16:16.20,00:16:16.20,I owe you that for letting me have a bath with you.
323,00:16:30.57,00:16:30.57,JENNA: This is Dave's third time eating.
324,00:16:33.53,00:16:33.53,This is Dave's second shower.
325,00:16:34.77,00:16:34.77,"-It's so wrong. -Dave's cleaning up, man."
326,00:16:35.97,00:16:35.97,Yeah.
327,00:16:37.20,00:16:37.20,Let me put on my bathing suit while I'm here.
328,00:16:39.70,00:16:39.70,"I was thinking that-- yeah, where are you going to go,"
329,00:16:41.23,00:16:41.23,-behind the tree? -Yeah.
330,00:16:42.70,00:16:42.70,ALEX: If you guys need any help washing up...
331,00:16:44.07,00:16:44.07,JENNA: You'll be the personal washing machine?
332,00:16:45.57,00:16:45.57,ALEX: I-I will be more than happy to help.
333,00:16:47.57,00:16:47.57,So just holler.
334,00:16:49.60,00:16:49.60,HEIDI:  We just got back from...
335,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,HEIDI AND JENNA:  ...reward challenge.
336,00:16:53.00,00:16:53.00,Sucky reward challenge.
337,00:16:54.27,00:16:54.27,-Terrible banana split loser reward challenge. -Yeah.
338,00:16:57.63,00:16:57.63,JENNA: We've been talking about ice cream for the past...
339,00:16:59.23,00:16:59.23,JENNA AND HEIDI:  Since day two.
340,00:17:00.63,00:17:00.63,"JENNA:  Banana splits specifically,"
341,00:17:01.97,00:17:01.97," and today we lost it,  but, oh, well."
342,00:17:05.30,00:17:05.30,-Yeah. -We don't need the fat anyway.
343,00:17:06.93,00:17:06.93,"-Yeah, exactly. -(laughs)"
344,00:17:11.73,00:17:11.73,JENNA: So I definitely think
345,00:17:12.93,00:17:12.93,it was a tactical move that he took Deena.
346,00:17:16.60,00:17:16.60,"-No doubt about it. -No, I definitely think so, too."
347,00:17:18.00,00:17:18.00,I don't think it's gonna work.
348,00:17:19.23,00:17:19.23, I just hope  they don't come back
349,00:17:21.23,00:17:21.23,and talk about their banana split for the whole night.
350,00:17:22.87,00:17:22.87,I-I'm going to ask them not to 'cause that-that's killer.
351,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,I seriously am going to ask them not to.
352,00:17:27.83,00:17:27.83,(Jenna mutters)
353,00:17:29.20,00:17:29.20,ROB:  Twigs and Sticks are
354,00:17:31.23,00:17:31.23,a nickname for Jenna and Heidi.
355,00:17:35.07,00:17:35.07, Their legs are  twigs and sticks.
356,00:17:37.73,00:17:37.73,I know that I certainly would catch on fire
357,00:17:39.33,00:17:39.33,if I ever saw Twigs and Sticks rubbing together.
358,00:17:41.23,00:17:41.23,JENNA: We got whipped today.
359,00:17:44.23,00:17:44.23,"-HEIDI: Yeah, so bad. -Yeah."
360,00:17:45.37,00:17:45.37,And that's just impossible.
361,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,"ROB: I really like my alliance  with Twigs and Sticks,"
362,00:17:50.77,00:17:50.77," but as much as I appreciate  Jenna and Heidi's company,"
363,00:17:55.03,00:17:55.03,I don't know if either of those girls would pay me
364,00:17:58.00,00:17:58.00,any attention in real life.
365,00:17:59.77,00:17:59.77,Super itchy.
366,00:18:01.40,00:18:01.40,ROB: And I don't ever  forget that fact.
367,00:18:02.83,00:18:02.83, I am aware  of how they're trying to use
368,00:18:05.93,00:18:05.93, their sexuality to get me  to do things that I wouldn't
369,00:18:08.80,00:18:08.80, normally do and make mistakes  that I wouldn't normally make.
370,00:18:12.27,00:18:12.27,"I really do play this game with this head,"
371,00:18:14.40,00:18:14.40,"even though it does, today, look"
372,00:18:16.67,00:18:16.67, like a different head.
373,00:18:24.17,00:18:24.17,"Honey, we're home."
374,00:18:26.53,00:18:26.53,Hi. Was it fun?
375,00:18:28.37,00:18:28.37,"Yeah, it was fun."
376,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,"It was, it was a dumbed-down bungalow type place."
377,00:18:33.80,00:18:33.80,DEENA: How was your afternoon?
378,00:18:35.23,00:18:35.23,ROB: We did-- we ate lunch.
379,00:18:37.07,00:18:37.07,I was just getting ready to make dinner.
380,00:18:38.47,00:18:38.47,"Good, I'm hungry."
381,00:18:40.00,00:18:40.00,"ROB: When Dave and Deena came back from the reward challenge,"
382,00:18:44.03,00:18:44.03,they started talking about how hungry they were.
383,00:18:46.83,00:18:46.83,"No, I'm hungry, Jenna, I'm hungry."
384,00:18:49.23,00:18:49.23,I want some manioc.
385,00:18:50.33,00:18:50.33,"JENNA:  I was like, ""Screw you,"
386,00:18:51.33,00:18:51.33,"""you fat pig."
387,00:18:52.67,00:18:52.67,"""You had ice cream all day and we are starving"
388,00:18:55.03,00:18:55.03,"and you want to come back and eat my manioc and fish."""
389,00:18:57.03,00:18:57.03,I've been talking about banana splits since day two.
390,00:18:58.70,00:18:58.70,I wanted to cut myself with a machete
391,00:19:00.17,00:19:00.17,-when we were walking back. -The banana split
392,00:19:01.40,00:19:01.40,"wasn't really ""a banana split."""
393,00:19:03.90,00:19:03.90,It was more...
394,00:19:05.43,00:19:05.43,-But it was ice cream. -...two bananas
395,00:19:06.93,00:19:06.93,"in a bowl, and then it had-- you know, there was"
396,00:19:10.93,00:19:10.93,-a couple little condiments. -Ice cream on it.
397,00:19:12.43,00:19:12.43,It wasn't very much ice cream... and it was all melted.
398,00:19:16.93,00:19:16.93,JENNA: Wasn't so much Deena;  it was Dave.
399,00:19:18.90,00:19:18.90, Common courtesy would say  since you just ate
400,00:19:21.57,00:19:21.57," three different types of ice creams, you would come back"
401,00:19:24.40,00:19:24.40, to your camp from people  who have been eating manioc
402,00:19:26.17,00:19:26.17, and let them eat the fish.
403,00:19:27.47,00:19:27.47,But I guess he doesn't realize that.
404,00:19:37.97,00:19:37.97,(chittering)
405,00:19:40.40,00:19:40.40,(snoring)
406,00:19:51.80,00:19:51.80,ROB:  I haven't spoken with Heidi

409,00:19:57.90,00:19:57.90,and I know that I hear a lot of rustling around

411,00:20:03.53,00:20:03.53,(snoring)

413,00:20:08.53,00:20:08.53," but then, in my mind,  potentially, I say, ""Well,"

415,00:20:14.97,00:20:14.97," If anybody wants-- is gonna be  having pillow talk with Heidi,"
416,00:20:18.07,00:20:18.07, I want to it be me  and not Dave.
417,00:20:20.07,00:20:20.07, I do think that maybe  I'd have a better chance
418,00:20:23.37,00:20:23.37," if Dave wasn't around,"
419,00:20:24.57,00:20:24.57, that maybe my arms  would be around Heidi.
420,00:20:26.77,00:20:26.77," It's very annoying,  the whole thing."
421,00:20:28.00,00:20:28.00, I don't like the fact that

530,00:24:56.77,00:24:56.77,and take a chop at somebody else's log.
531,00:24:59.27,00:24:59.27,The logs are secured in three places--

613,00:28:15.93,00:28:15.93,"A: a giant white toucan,"
614,00:28:19.10,00:28:19.10,"B: a Yanomami tribesman,"
615,00:28:21.83,00:28:21.83,"C: the world's largest viper,"
616,00:28:24.07,00:28:24.07,or D: an Amazonian forest ranger.
617,00:28:27.50,00:28:27.50,Reveal.
618,00:28:30.30,00:28:30.30,Everybody but Rob is right.
619,00:28:31.80,00:28:31.80,-Oh! -It is the largest viper.
620,00:28:34.03,00:28:34.03,You thought it was a forest ranger?
621,00:28:35.43,00:28:35.43,I thought it was a porn star before you read the choices.
622,00:28:38.30,00:28:38.30,Take a step back.
623,00:28:40.27,00:28:40.27,"Oh, man, that was horrible, Rob."
624,00:28:43.53,00:28:43.53,"PROBST: Deena, you're first."
625,00:28:47.43,00:28:47.43,Rob takes his first hit.
626,00:28:50.10,00:28:50.10,Heidi thinking about it.
627,00:28:51.90,00:28:51.90,Rob takes two hits in a row.
628,00:28:54.63,00:28:54.63,"One chop away from being out of the game, Rob."
629,00:28:56.50,00:28:56.50,"Jenna, first chance to use that machete."
630,00:29:00.53,00:29:00.53,Butch takes his first hit.
631,00:29:03.00,00:29:03.00,Christy knows exactly where she's going.
632,00:29:06.33,00:29:06.33,Oh!
633,00:29:08.83,00:29:08.83,"-Out. -PROBST: Just like that, Rob."
634,00:29:10.93,00:29:10.93,Have a seat.
635,00:29:12.37,00:29:12.37,-Butch. -Uh-oh.
636,00:29:14.10,00:29:14.10,Butch is going right back to Jenna.
637,00:29:18.47,00:29:18.47,That's fine.
638,00:29:19.50,00:29:19.50,PROBST: Jenna takes her first hit.
639,00:29:21.60,00:29:21.60,PROBST: Christy and Heidi-- the only players
640,00:29:23.30,00:29:23.30,"that don't have any hits, yet, on their rope."
641,00:29:25.97,00:29:25.97,Next question. True or false:
642,00:29:28.23,00:29:28.23,Amazonian tribesmen still use primitive weapons
643,00:29:32.43,00:29:32.43,like bows and arrows and blowpipes
644,00:29:34.77,00:29:34.77,to hunt birds and monkeys.
645,00:29:38.43,00:29:38.43,Reveal.
646,00:29:40.33,00:29:40.33,Everybody says true. Everybody is right.
647,00:29:43.43,00:29:43.43,"Take your first move, Heidi."
648,00:29:44.60,00:29:44.60,"Butch, you are one chop away"
649,00:29:47.53,00:29:47.53,from being out of the game.
650,00:29:50.57,00:29:50.57,"Where you going, Butch?"
651,00:29:51.80,00:29:51.80,"Gunning for you, Heidi."
652,00:29:56.57,00:29:56.57,"-Feel good, didn't it? -It sure did."
653,00:29:59.10,00:29:59.10,"All right, Jenna."
654,00:30:00.60,00:30:00.60,The southpaw.
655,00:30:01.87,00:30:01.87,No. No. No. No!
656,00:30:04.47,00:30:04.47,"-Oh! -PROBST: Bye-bye, Butch."
657,00:30:07.10,00:30:07.10,You know how many students would like to do that?
658,00:30:09.67,00:30:09.67,(laughs)
659,00:30:10.83,00:30:10.83,Take a seat.
660,00:30:12.37,00:30:12.37,"Where you going, Christy?"
661,00:30:16.47,00:30:16.47,Deena takes another hit.
662,00:30:17.83,00:30:17.83,-Deena? -Hmm. Where are we going to go?
663,00:30:22.47,00:30:22.47,PROBST: Christy takes her first hit.
664,00:30:23.97,00:30:23.97,Next question. True or false:
665,00:30:26.30,00:30:26.30,the Amazon is the longest river in the world.
666,00:30:29.77,00:30:29.77,Hide your answers.
667,00:30:32.33,00:30:32.33,Everybody reveal.
668,00:30:34.37,00:30:34.37,Everybody got it right.
669,00:30:36.07,00:30:36.07,The Nile is the longest river in the world.
670,00:30:38.97,00:30:38.97,"Christy, you're up first."
671,00:30:44.77,00:30:44.77,"Heidi, you are down to one chop left."
672,00:30:48.53,00:30:48.53,"Deena, you could put Heidi out."
673,00:30:53.70,00:30:53.70,"Christy, you're down to your last chop,"
674,00:30:55.97,00:30:55.97,and it may be over for Christy.
675,00:30:59.87,00:30:59.87,Aw!
676,00:31:01.20,00:31:01.20,Christy takes a seat.
677,00:31:02.93,00:31:02.93,We're down to three. Jenna.
678,00:31:04.90,00:31:04.90,Deena's threat is coming into play.
679,00:31:06.87,00:31:06.87,"No, not a threat, 'cause she's already won it."
680,00:31:08.50,00:31:08.50,PROBST: She's already won it.
681,00:31:09.60,00:31:09.60,Somebody else is wearing the necklace now.
682,00:31:10.87,00:31:10.87,-You want to share the immunity. -Share the necklace.
683,00:31:13.13,00:31:13.13,So here's where we're at.
684,00:31:14.27,00:31:14.27,"Jenna, you've got two chops left."
685,00:31:15.93,00:31:15.93,"Heidi, you're down to your last one."
686,00:31:17.47,00:31:17.47,"No matter what happens,"
687,00:31:18.90,00:31:18.90,"if Jenna gets this question right, game's over."
688,00:31:21.97,00:31:21.97,Here we go. Immunity at stake.
689,00:31:24.63,00:31:24.63,"A pirarucu is: A: fish,"
690,00:31:27.90,00:31:27.90,"B: snake, C: ritual, D: rainfall."
691,00:31:35.37,00:31:35.37,Immunity at stake. Reveal.
692,00:31:38.20,00:31:38.20,A: an Amazonian fish is correct.
693,00:31:44.07,00:31:44.07,"Heidi, you'll go first."
694,00:31:48.93,00:31:48.93,(everyone groans)
695,00:31:53.77,00:31:53.77,"PROBST: Nice job, Jenna."
696,00:31:55.07,00:31:55.07,"(cheering, applause)"
697,00:32:02.93,00:32:02.93,Well earned. Well played.
698,00:32:04.87,00:32:04.87,You are safe tonight at Tribal Council.
699,00:32:08.10,00:32:08.10,Everybody else is vulnerable.
700,00:32:09.47,00:32:09.47,"Guys, get your stuff and head back to camp."
701,00:32:52.57,00:32:52.57,MATTHEW: I destroyed these shoes  one night by leaving them
702,00:32:56.47,00:32:56.47," a bit too close to the fire,  so they're impossible to wear."
703,00:33:02.20,00:33:02.20,My objective for this afternoon
704,00:33:04.60,00:33:04.60,is to MacGyver these into suitable sandals.
705,00:33:10.60,00:33:10.60,I'll be a much happier person as a result.
706,00:33:13.17,00:33:13.17,(chuckles)
707,00:33:19.40,00:33:19.40,"CHRISTY:  I'd vote off Matt because,"
708,00:33:21.43,00:33:21.43," you know, I don't know what is going through his head."
709,00:33:24.03,00:33:24.03," And he just  gives me the creeps,"
710,00:33:25.47,00:33:25.47,"and I don't know how long I can, like, be around him."
711,00:33:34.87,00:33:34.87,DAVE: I am going to vote  for Matt tonight because...
712,00:33:37.97,00:33:37.97,it's the only way that I can stay on for another three days.
713,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,"And, hopefully, my vote and a couple other people's"
714,00:33:45.77,00:33:45.77,will... will be enough
715,00:33:47.13,00:33:47.13,to get the majority of votes against Matt.
716,00:33:49.93,00:33:49.93,-If I can get one more out of you guys... -Right.
717,00:33:53.80,00:33:53.80,"as, you know-- and really, I mean, it's..."
718,00:33:56.03,00:33:56.03,-it's a sympathy vote. -Right.
719,00:33:57.70,00:33:57.70,"Two things working against you, though."
720,00:34:00.47,00:34:00.47,"One was, you know, Roger-- obvious."
721,00:34:04.30,00:34:04.30,"-Right. -The other is, I mean, you're a threat, dude."
722,00:34:07.27,00:34:07.27,You're a ... badass.
723,00:34:08.50,00:34:08.50,-Nobody wants to ... around with you. -I know.
724,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,ALEX:  I am voting for Dave tonight.
725,00:34:13.80,00:34:13.80, He's probably  the single biggest
726,00:34:15.43,00:34:15.43, threat out here right now.
727,00:34:16.83,00:34:16.83,I'd rather not compete against him anymore.
728,00:34:19.30,00:34:19.30,So what's Heidi thinking about this whole thing?
729,00:34:20.80,00:34:20.80,"What, you mean, like, about..."
730,00:34:21.87,00:34:21.87,"-about, like, Dave? -'Cause I..."
731,00:34:23.10,00:34:23.10,"-Yeah, you know... -Did you see when I went..."
732,00:34:24.63,00:34:24.63,"-Yeah, with Dave. -When I went... when I went to..."
733,00:34:26.10,00:34:26.10,did you see when I... I went to bed last night
734,00:34:27.97,00:34:27.97,"that-that, uh... that-that Dave"
735,00:34:30.27,00:34:30.27,and Heidi were in a full embrace?
736,00:34:33.20,00:34:33.20,Dave always embraces Heidi.
737,00:34:35.50,00:34:35.50,"I don't know how she feels about him, personally."
738,00:34:39.07,00:34:39.07,"DAVE:  It's either me or Matt,"
739,00:34:40.37,00:34:40.37,"and, uh, I'd like to go..."
740,00:34:43.30,00:34:43.30,I'd like to go three more days.
741,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,"I would like for you to go three more days,"
742,00:34:48.00,00:34:48.00,especially compared to Matt. (chuckles)
743,00:34:49.43,00:34:49.43,"I think... honestly, I think Deena feels the same way I do."
744,00:34:52.63,00:34:52.63,-Deena does. -I think she really does.
745,00:34:55.13,00:34:55.13,But that's only three people.
746,00:34:56.73,00:34:56.73,I need two more.
747,00:34:58.57,00:34:58.57,"I don't know. I... seriously,"
748,00:34:59.80,00:34:59.80,I think you stand a 50-50 chance right now.
749,00:35:01.80,00:35:01.80,-I have a 50-50 chance. -You do.
750,00:35:03.27,00:35:03.27,"-And, uh... -And that's the way I'd look at it."
751,00:35:05.00,00:35:05.00,So...
752,00:35:54.77,00:35:54.77,"PROBST: Hello, guys."
753,00:35:56.40,00:35:56.40,Hey.
754,00:35:57.77,00:35:57.77,Let's talk about how people are fitting in now.
755,00:35:59.87,00:35:59.87,"Matthew, in the past, when we talked about fitting in,"
756,00:36:03.03,00:36:03.03,"you were pretty honest in saying,"
757,00:36:05.00,00:36:05.00,"""I haven't totally fit in."""
758,00:36:06.87,00:36:06.87,Has that changed?
759,00:36:08.10,00:36:08.10,"It's completely changed, actually."
760,00:36:09.80,00:36:09.80,"When we merged here and, uh, started to spend"
761,00:36:13.03,00:36:13.03,"more time together, I found that, uh, people"
762,00:36:16.00,00:36:16.00,were a lot more interested in what I had to say.
763,00:36:19.00,00:36:19.00,"I feel like I have some true friends,"
764,00:36:21.83,00:36:21.83,and I feel like we have
765,00:36:23.10,00:36:23.10,"some great, uh, genuine, uh, relationships."
766,00:36:26.27,00:36:26.27,"Rob, a lot of facial expressions during that answer."
767,00:36:29.53,00:36:29.53,I'm just so happy with Matthew's progress.
768,00:36:32.27,00:36:32.27,I was with Matthew for the first
769,00:36:34.33,00:36:34.33,"14 days of this game at Tambaqui,"
770,00:36:36.53,00:36:36.53,"and he really was kind of, uh, secluded to himself,"
771,00:36:40.40,00:36:40.40,"and now I think that he's fit in so well now,"
772,00:36:44.27,00:36:44.27,and he really has become
773,00:36:45.53,00:36:45.53,an invaluable part of this tribe.
774,00:36:47.13,00:36:47.13,"Heidi, let's talk about the immunity challenge."
775,00:36:50.27,00:36:50.27,There really was no hiding what was going on.
776,00:36:53.77,00:36:53.77,It's designed to let people know
777,00:36:55.80,00:36:55.80,where they stand within the tribe.
778,00:36:57.50,00:36:57.50,What was your thoughts on how that game played out?
779,00:36:59.77,00:36:59.77,I thought it was really interesting
780,00:37:02.23,00:37:02.23,that the four girls (chuckles)
781,00:37:05.10,00:37:05.10,were the last ones left.
782,00:37:07.40,00:37:07.40,"Um, I really didn't expect that to happen, like, whatsoever."
783,00:37:10.40,00:37:10.40,"The guys pretty much eliminated themselves,"
784,00:37:14.10,00:37:14.10,instead of working against the girls.
785,00:37:16.43,00:37:16.43,"PROBST: And Matthew, on the other hand,"
786,00:37:17.73,00:37:17.73,"you were the first one taken out of the challenge,"
787,00:37:19.73,00:37:19.73,followed closely by Dave.
788,00:37:22.60,00:37:22.60,That's got to tell you something about what people
789,00:37:24.40,00:37:24.40,-are thinking about you. -MATTHEW: No kidding.
790,00:37:25.93,00:37:25.93,"I-I-I wasn't very happy where I fell,"
791,00:37:27.77,00:37:27.77,"but hey, that's the way the ball bounces."
792,00:37:29.80,00:37:29.80,"PROBST: Dave, same question."
793,00:37:31.57,00:37:31.57,Why do you think you were taken out?
794,00:37:32.93,00:37:32.93,"You, know it is a game."
795,00:37:34.13,00:37:34.13,"It's an individual game at this point,"
796,00:37:35.50,00:37:35.50,"and, uh, a group of people might see me as a threat"
797,00:37:38.63,00:37:38.63,"and, uh, therefore want to get me out as soon as possible."
798,00:37:41.63,00:37:41.63,I am in a precarious position right now.
799,00:37:44.17,00:37:44.17,"I know that... that my name will come up tonight,"
800,00:37:46.30,00:37:46.30,"and hopefully, it won't be the majority,"
801,00:37:49.63,00:37:49.63,but... but we'll see.
802,00:37:50.90,00:37:50.90,"These next three days are... are important to me,"
803,00:37:53.73,00:37:53.73,"and, um, I would like to spend them"
804,00:37:55.90,00:37:55.90,with the... the eight people
805,00:37:57.07,00:37:57.07,that are sitting down here in front of me.
806,00:37:58.73,00:37:58.73,"PROBST: Deena, can a obviously heartfelt plea like that"
807,00:38:03.53,00:38:03.53,"ever sway a vote, if indeed that vote"
808,00:38:05.97,00:38:05.97,is already heading Dave's way?
809,00:38:07.77,00:38:07.77,If I've learned anything
810,00:38:09.10,00:38:09.10,"during the course of my lifetime,"
811,00:38:10.80,00:38:10.80,"human emotion can be dictated by human sentiment,"
812,00:38:14.43,00:38:14.43,and I absolutely think there's people who had question marks
813,00:38:17.03,00:38:17.03,"in their head and said, ""All right,"
814,00:38:18.70,00:38:18.70,"""well, I told these people I would,"
815,00:38:20.23,00:38:20.23,"""but, oh, gosh,"
816,00:38:21.97,00:38:21.97,"he... it's just... I just can't do it tonight."""
817,00:38:24.23,00:38:24.23,So... so yes.
818,00:38:26.27,00:38:26.27,"PROBST: Jenna, you have immunity around your neck."
819,00:38:28.90,00:38:28.90,"If you feel comfortable enough within the tribe,"
820,00:38:31.63,00:38:31.63,you could offer it to anyone else in exchange for something.
821,00:38:34.87,00:38:34.87,I couldn't see anything that could be exchanged for immunity.
822,00:38:38.23,00:38:38.23,"It's mine, and I'm going to keep it."
823,00:38:39.57,00:38:39.57,PROBST: All right.
824,00:38:40.80,00:38:40.80,"Well, as we have clearly illustrated tonight,"
825,00:38:43.60,00:38:43.60,"at this point, the game definitely changes,"
826,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23,because you are no longer just voting people out;
827,00:38:48.60,00:38:48.60,you're voting people out who you're then going to ask
828,00:38:50.67,00:38:50.67,to come back as a member of a jury
829,00:38:52.80,00:38:52.80,"and decide, ultimately, who will be the sole survivor."
830,00:38:56.43,00:38:56.43,"It is time to vote. Deena, you're up."
831,00:39:23.20,00:39:23.20,He's a great guy.
832,00:39:24.73,00:39:24.73,"Really enjoy his company, but..."
833,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33, his time has come.
834,00:39:53.30,00:39:53.30,We've been honest with each other since day one.
835,00:39:55.90,00:39:55.90,"Think it's interesting how both, I guess,"
836,00:39:58.47,00:39:58.47,"perceived physical powerhouses are now dueling it,"
837,00:40:01.27,00:40:01.27, one for one--  it has to come down to this.
838,00:40:03.50,00:40:03.50, I hope it's you and not me.
839,00:40:05.00,00:40:05.00,Nothing personal. Take care.
840,00:40:18.93,00:40:18.93,"I have total, total respect"
841,00:40:20.73,00:40:20.73,for everything you've done in this game.
842,00:40:22.33,00:40:22.33, You've played it well.  You've played it hard.
843,00:40:24.53,00:40:24.53, Those are reasons  we have to get you out.
844,00:40:33.70,00:40:33.70,I'll go tally the votes.
845,00:40:44.43,00:40:44.43,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
846,00:40:46.57,00:40:46.57,Person voted out will be asked
847,00:40:47.83,00:40:47.83,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
848,00:40:49.60,00:40:49.60,I'll read the votes.
849,00:40:55.30,00:40:55.30,First vote.
850,00:40:57.77,00:40:57.77,Dave.
851,00:41:04.00,00:41:04.00,Matt.
852,00:41:06.43,00:41:06.43,"One vote Dave, one vote Matt."
853,00:41:12.87,00:41:12.87,That's two votes Dave.
854,00:41:19.70,00:41:19.70,Three votes Dave.
855,00:41:24.67,00:41:24.67,Dave. That's four votes.
856,00:41:29.70,00:41:29.70,The eighth person voted out
857,00:41:31.23,00:41:31.23,and the first member of our jury: Dave.
858,00:41:34.23,00:41:34.23,That's five votes. That's enough.
859,00:41:36.40,00:41:36.40,Need to bring me your torch.
860,00:41:48.43,00:41:48.43,"Dave, the tribe has spoken."
861,00:42:07.63,00:42:07.63,"Well, clearly, this is a game about relationships."
862,00:42:11.50,00:42:11.50,"With only 15 days left,"
863,00:42:13.30,00:42:13.30,the question you have to be asking yourselves
864,00:42:16.00,00:42:16.00,"is: ""Are the relationships I formed out here genuine?"
865,00:42:20.17,00:42:20.17,"Can they get me to the end?"""
866,00:42:22.73,00:42:22.73,Something to think about as you head back to camp.
867,00:42:25.57,00:42:25.57,"Good night, guys."
868,00:42:40.43,00:42:40.43,PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
869,00:42:46.47,00:42:46.47,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor:
870,00:42:48.47,00:42:48.47, Butch gets a bite
871,00:42:50.17,00:42:50.17, -on the finger.  -Ow! God. -How bad?
872,00:42:52.00,00:42:52.00," BUTCH: The fish was dead,  and he had one last bite."
873,00:42:55.70,00:42:55.70,PROBST: And a power struggle  erupts at Jacar\xc3\xa9.
874,00:42:58.23,00:42:58.23,Deena thinks that she's pulling the strings.
875,00:43:01.13,00:43:01.13, Alex thinks  that he's calling the shots.
876,00:43:03.77,00:43:03.77,Who's really calling the shots?  Me.
877,00:43:11.53,00:43:11.53,I wish the best for everybody out there.
878,00:43:13.20,00:43:13.20," And I think, uh, you know,  on closing terms,"
879,00:43:15.80,00:43:15.80," there's a great, uh, Nepalese  saying that goes, uh..."
880,00:43:19.83,00:43:19.83," ""K garne neparne."""
881,00:43:22.77,00:43:22.77," It means, ""What to do?"""
882,00:43:24.77,00:43:24.77," And, uh, I'm here right now,  and I'm hungry,"
883,00:43:27.40,00:43:27.40," and it's, uh,  it's food time, so..."
884,00:43:30.00,00:43:30.00,take care.
