3,00:00:03.43,00:00:03.43,"- Down, down, faster!"
4,00:00:04.90,00:00:04.90,Hurry up!
5,00:00:06.00,00:00:06.00,"- (Jeff Probst) 36 days ago,"
6,00:00:07.67,00:00:07.67,16 Americans began the adventure of a lifetime.
7,00:00:10.83,00:00:10.83,"- All right, here we go."
8,00:00:13.57,00:00:13.57,- (Probst) They were abandoned in the heart of wild Africa and
9,00:00:16.83,00:00:16.83,"forced to work together to build a new world, while competing"
10,00:00:19.57,00:00:19.57,against each other for the title of sole Survivor and $1 million.
11,00:00:26.63,00:00:26.63,Survivors ready?
12,00:00:27.87,00:00:27.87,"- Hell, yeah!"
13,00:00:28.90,00:00:28.90,- (Probst) Go!
14,00:00:30.03,00:00:30.03,"As two separate tribes, Samburu and Boran,"
15,00:00:33.37,00:00:33.37,they faced extreme challenges.
16,00:00:35.83,00:00:35.83,Get that down!
17,00:00:37.00,00:00:37.00,Get that down.
18,00:00:39.27,00:00:39.27,Linda.
19,00:00:41.10,00:00:41.10,"- Wait, wait, wait!"
20,00:00:42.33,00:00:42.33,- (Probst) They battled each other.
21,00:00:44.70,00:00:44.70,"- It don't matter, we're all making it."
22,00:00:46.27,00:00:46.27,You can't make the decisions!
23,00:00:47.43,00:00:47.43,"- Tommy, Tommy."
24,00:00:48.47,00:00:48.47,I had to open it for her.
25,00:00:49.97,00:00:49.97,- (Probst) And they confronted the dangers of an exotic land.
26,00:00:53.07,00:00:53.07,- Uh-oh.
27,00:00:56.27,00:00:56.27,(growling)
28,00:00:57.30,00:00:57.30,"- Oh, my God."
29,00:00:58.37,00:00:58.37,"Oh, my God."
30,00:01:00.50,00:01:00.50,- (Probst) As alliances hit a fevered pitch...
31,00:01:02.80,00:01:02.80,"- We're going to take it all the way, trust me."
32,00:01:04.70,00:01:04.70,- (Probst) ...a new twist to the game sent them reeling.
33,00:01:07.37,00:01:07.37,"Silas, Teresa, Frank, you guys are now members of Boran."
34,00:01:10.20,00:01:10.20,"Kelly, Lex, Tom, you guys are now members of Samburu."
35,00:01:14.47,00:01:14.47,- Smokes.
36,00:01:17.80,00:01:17.80,"- (Probst) Since that time, emotions have run high..."
37,00:01:20.10,00:01:20.10,"- Well, then, which one do you want to take?"
38,00:01:21.87,00:01:21.87,- That's what I'm saying.
39,00:01:22.90,00:01:22.90,"- Well, let's decide, damn it."
40,00:01:23.97,00:01:23.97,- (Probst) Some friendships held...
41,00:01:26.17,00:01:26.17,"- I didn't vote for a friend of mine, and that makes me"
42,00:01:28.97,00:01:28.97,the happiest person on the face of the Earth.
43,00:01:31.00,00:01:31.00,- (Probst) ...while others crumbled.
44,00:01:32.77,00:01:32.77,- I was set up by somebody who I thought was my friend.
45,00:01:36.93,00:01:36.93,"- (Probst) After the merge on day 20, tempers flared when Lex"
46,00:01:39.73,00:01:39.73,received a mystery vote at Tribal Council.
47,00:01:43.03,00:01:43.03,- I will not live with a snake.
48,00:01:44.33,00:01:44.33,"- I'm sorry, someone voted"
49,00:01:45.73,00:01:45.73,"against you, Mr. Ego, deal with it."
50,00:01:47.83,00:01:47.83,"- My gut tells me, you stabbed me in the back and you're"
51,00:01:50.60,00:01:50.60,playing both sides.
52,00:01:52.03,00:01:52.03,Good riddance.
53,00:01:54.70,00:01:54.70,- (Probst) Go!
54,00:01:56.17,00:01:56.17,"But through it all, they have continued to play the game."
55,00:01:59.10,00:01:59.10,- I have it!
56,00:02:00.17,00:02:00.17,- Drop it!
57,00:02:01.90,00:02:01.90,(cheering)
58,00:02:05.43,00:02:05.43,- (Probst) And they have experienced the culture in
59,00:02:07.40,00:02:07.40,unforgettable ways.
60,00:02:09.40,00:02:09.40,- It was a day I will never ever forget.
61,00:02:13.23,00:02:13.23,- This just shows me that there's more to life than just
62,00:02:15.77,00:02:15.77,what's around the corner at the house.
63,00:02:20.40,00:02:20.40,- Yeah!
64,00:02:22.87,00:02:22.87,"- (Probst) Last week, Lex won immunity, and before"
65,00:02:25.27,00:02:25.27,"Tribal Council, Teresa was desperate."
66,00:02:28.50,00:02:28.50,- I know that I'm going to be the next one to go unless I can
67,00:02:30.63,00:02:30.63,think of something real quick.
68,00:02:32.27,00:02:32.27,"- (Probst) To save herself, she played her final card."
69,00:02:35.13,00:02:35.13,She confessed to Lex that she was the one who cast the vote
70,00:02:37.77,00:02:37.77,that sent him on his witch-hunt.
71,00:02:40.60,00:02:40.60,"- She said, ""You know, when you got that one mystery vote,"""
72,00:02:42.97,00:02:42.97,"who at the time I thought might be Kelly,"
73,00:02:45.10,00:02:45.10,"""I was the one that cast that vote for you."""
74,00:02:49.00,00:02:49.00,"- (Probst) But in her confession, Teresa also"
75,00:02:51.40,00:02:51.40,implicated Tom in hopes of getting him voted out.
76,00:02:54.53,00:02:54.53,- When I came over with this
77,00:02:56.03,00:02:56.03,"tribe, a little birdie whispered something in my ear."
78,00:02:59.80,00:02:59.80,- Did Tom tell you not to trust me?
79,00:03:02.93,00:03:02.93,- (Probst) Teresa's plan to get Tom ousted didn't work.
80,00:03:06.73,00:03:06.73,"At Tribal Council, the ex-Boran members remained true to each"
81,00:03:09.80,00:03:09.80,"other, and Teresa was the 12th person voted out of the tribe."
82,00:03:17.40,00:03:17.40,Only four remain.
83,00:03:19.77,00:03:19.77,Tonight they will compete in their final immunity challenges.
84,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,Two will continue on to face the jury.
85,00:03:25.80,00:03:25.80,One will outlast all the rest and become the sole Survivor.
86,00:03:36.17,00:03:36.17,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
87,00:04:40.43,00:04:40.43,(wildebeests snort)
88,00:04:51.33,00:04:51.33,"- Congratulations, everyone, for making the final four."
89,00:04:55.90,00:04:55.90,- It's been quite an experience.
90,00:04:58.07,00:04:58.07,"- We're in the homestretch,"
91,00:04:59.67,00:04:59.67,and emotions are just all over the map.
92,00:05:03.13,00:05:03.13,"I mean, this game goes over a 39-day period,"
93,00:05:05.93,00:05:05.93,and the whole thing is like a giant puzzle.
94,00:05:08.30,00:05:08.30,"And sometimes when one person says something to you, like what"
95,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,"T-Bird said to me before Tribal Council, all of a sudden some of"
96,00:05:14.50,00:05:14.50,"the loose puzzle pieces, you find the spot that they fit in."
97,00:05:16.87,00:05:16.87,(whispering) T-Bird told me she
98,00:05:19.10,00:05:19.10,"voted for me because of one thing and one thing only,"
99,00:05:21.17,00:05:21.17,because Tom said I couldn't be trusted.
100,00:05:24.90,00:05:24.90,That I needed to get votes.
101,00:05:27.20,00:05:27.20,"- Yesterday, right before Tribal Council, Teresa came"
102,00:05:30.40,00:05:30.40,"clean that back when we were voting off Clarence, she was the"
103,00:05:33.43,00:05:33.43,one that voted that second vote for Lex.
104,00:05:36.53,00:05:36.53,That upset Lex so much in the beginning.
105,00:05:39.40,00:05:39.40,And Teresa also said Tommy had been lobbying to get Lex voted
106,00:05:42.47,00:05:42.47,"off, and that was very upsetting to Lex."
107,00:05:48.60,00:05:48.60,- (whispering) Tommy had a grudge
108,00:05:49.77,00:05:49.77,because he felt that Lex hung him out to dry.
109,00:05:52.07,00:05:52.07,- I'm still skeptical of the whole threesome thing.
110,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,"- I would be skeptical, too, but two different occasions,"
111,00:05:58.57,00:05:58.57,he wanted me to vote off Lex.
112,00:06:01.37,00:06:01.37,"- Mama Cat had been approached a couple times by Tom, who had"
113,00:06:03.90,00:06:03.90,"told her, ""You know, if you happen to vote for Lex in any of"
114,00:06:07.30,00:06:07.30,"these Tribal Councils, that's totally okay by me."""
115,00:06:16.60,00:06:16.60,"- (whispering) In his mind, he can't write"
116,00:06:18.30,00:06:18.30,"the vote down, but if someone else does, that's okay."
117,00:06:22.23,00:06:22.23,"I mean, I won't know tomorrow because I'm going to take Tom"
118,00:06:25.93,00:06:25.93,"and he and I are going to have a man-to-man talk, just the two of"
119,00:06:28.20,00:06:28.20,"us, and I am going to make him shake on it, on his son's name,"
120,00:06:31.87,00:06:31.87,"and if he won't do that, then I know what the truth is."
121,00:06:36.40,00:06:36.40,- All right.
122,00:06:38.37,00:06:38.37,- I'm not naively going to let myself be led to slaughter.
123,00:06:43.07,00:06:43.07,I've worked too hard.
124,00:07:09.43,00:07:09.43,"- What's up, Kimmy?"
125,00:07:10.70,00:07:10.70,- Nothing's changed.
126,00:07:12.10,00:07:12.10,"Same place, same old, same old."
127,00:07:15.50,00:07:15.50,Today is day 37.
128,00:07:17.73,00:07:17.73,It's exactly five weeks today
129,00:07:19.87,00:07:19.87,"that we've been out here, and that's a long time."
130,00:07:26.50,00:07:26.50,- Day 37.
131,00:07:27.60,00:07:27.60,"- Amazing, huh?"
132,00:07:28.87,00:07:28.87,- I can't believe it.
133,00:07:31.43,00:07:31.43,- The four of us left are all probably more surprised than
134,00:07:33.43,00:07:33.43,the next about the fact that we're still here.
135,00:07:36.13,00:07:36.13,And I couldn't have imagined it being as crazy as it is.
136,00:07:38.80,00:07:38.80,"It's good, it's bad, it's bitter, it's sweet."
137,00:07:41.00,00:07:41.00,- The men are going off to work.
138,00:07:43.80,00:07:43.80,"- But more now than ever, our brains are focused on, well,"
139,00:07:46.80,00:07:46.80,is there anyone trying to burn me?
140,00:07:59.30,00:07:59.30,I felt that there's a really good chance that Tom had pulled
141,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97,"a bit of treachery when it came to him and me, and what I need"
142,00:08:05.73,00:08:05.73,"to do is confront Tom with it and just find out was it true,"
143,00:08:08.70,00:08:08.70,was he going to 'fess up to it?
144,00:08:10.83,00:08:10.83,"Tom, I want to talk."
145,00:08:12.20,00:08:12.20,"- Okay, brother."
146,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,"- I heard some stuff yesterday that made me really unhappy,"
147,00:08:16.40,00:08:16.40,and I need to talk to you about it.
148,00:08:17.43,00:08:17.43,- Okay.
149,00:08:18.60,00:08:18.60,- Because I believe in having everything
150,00:08:19.63,00:08:19.63,right out in the open.
151,00:08:20.70,00:08:20.70,"- Okay, you put it out here."
152,00:08:22.27,00:08:22.27,"- When we came back from Samburu, did you tell T-Bird"
153,00:08:25.97,00:08:25.97,"that she couldn't trust me, that I was not to be trusted?"
154,00:08:29.37,00:08:29.37,- Absolutely not.
155,00:08:31.83,00:08:31.83,"No question, no ifs, no ands, no ands about it."
156,00:08:36.87,00:08:36.87,What kind of question is that to ask this far down in the game?
157,00:08:40.33,00:08:40.33,"Hell, far as I know, I don't think I did, but if I did,"
158,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47,Lex has been the man to watch.
159,00:08:45.63,00:08:45.63,"Hell, he's been winning immunities and everything else,"
160,00:08:49.43,00:08:49.43,and that's the reason he's getting all the votes.
161,00:08:51.07,00:08:51.07,If you're going to run in the front of the pack
162,00:08:52.90,00:08:52.90,"with a white horse, you're going to be shot at."
163,00:08:55.97,00:08:55.97,"- Also, did you ever tell Kim that she should vote for me,"
164,00:08:58.13,00:08:58.13,"that you would never vote for me because we made a pact,"
165,00:09:00.10,00:09:00.10,but she should vote for me?
166,00:09:01.80,00:09:01.80,"- Right, I told her, yeah, yeah."
167,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,- Why did you do that?
168,00:09:05.13,00:09:05.13,"- Because in the game, if she wanted to... the other players,"
169,00:09:08.40,00:09:08.40,I had no control...
170,00:09:09.87,00:09:09.87,- Why would you tell her to vote for me when we made a pact?
171,00:09:12.43,00:09:12.43,- Why dig up bones?
172,00:09:13.80,00:09:13.80,- Not digging up bones.
173,00:09:14.93,00:09:14.93,This is-- these are current events.
174,00:09:17.07,00:09:17.07,"- That's kind of like over there at Samburu, you were"
175,00:09:19.37,00:09:19.37,"the first one that said, ""Well, don't vote for me."""
176,00:09:21.60,00:09:21.60,"- No, I didn't say that, Tom, at all."
177,00:09:23.77,00:09:23.77,I thought it was only fair and right for me to say that none of
178,00:09:26.00,00:09:26.00,"us had votes against us, and I talked to you about it"
179,00:09:28.23,00:09:28.23,"before I talked to Brandon about it,"
180,00:09:29.90,00:09:29.90,and you said that was the fair thing to do.
181,00:09:32.23,00:09:32.23,- I felt like you saved your ass over there.
182,00:09:34.63,00:09:34.63,"- No, that's not true, you know what, well,"
183,00:09:36.27,00:09:36.27,"I'll tell you right now, you're wrong."
184,00:09:38.80,00:09:38.80,"Tom and I, there have been a couple of situations in the past"
185,00:09:40.90,00:09:40.90,that have arisen that we haven't quite seen eye-to-eye on.
186,00:09:44.30,00:09:44.30,And I guess Tom had the impression that I wasn't really
187,00:09:47.40,00:09:47.40,"working quite with him or for him, but against him."
188,00:09:50.07,00:09:50.07,"- All right, now, let me ask you this."
189,00:09:52.57,00:09:52.57,"Lex, all I had to do is vote one time"
190,00:09:53.90,00:09:53.90,"to get you off, anytime I wanted."
191,00:09:56.07,00:09:56.07,"- I know that, but..."
192,00:09:57.13,00:09:57.13,- Anytime I wanted to.
193,00:09:58.50,00:09:58.50,"All I had to go like this, L-E-X, and you know what?"
194,00:10:01.90,00:10:01.90,"- You know what, I could have done the same thing."
195,00:10:03.37,00:10:03.37,- That's right.
196,00:10:04.80,00:10:04.80,"- Tom, I want to go back to camp with you and I square."
197,00:10:07.63,00:10:07.63,"But I don't want you walking back there, thinking that the"
198,00:10:09.47,00:10:09.47,only reason I'm still in the game is by your good graces.
199,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,- I'm not...
200,00:10:12.63,00:10:12.63,- I'm not here because anybody carried me along.
201,00:10:14.97,00:10:14.97,No one carried me here.
202,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,You're responsible because you're here.
203,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,I'm responsible because I'm here.
204,00:10:19.80,00:10:19.80,It's not because Big Tom did Lex a favor that I'm here.
205,00:10:22.03,00:10:22.03,- I haven't saved you.
206,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,- We've covered each other.
207,00:10:24.63,00:10:24.63,"- Right, and the thing about it, Lex, we've got three more"
208,00:10:27.17,00:10:27.17,"days, and I'm not going to fall out in three days."
209,00:10:29.63,00:10:29.63,- All right.
210,00:10:30.80,00:10:30.80,- The thing between me and Lex
211,00:10:32.53,00:10:32.53,"is basically a case of paranoia, and ""worry-ation."""
212,00:10:37.27,00:10:37.27,But my alliance with Lex and
213,00:10:38.60,00:10:38.60,"Ethan has not, you know, has not quivered."
214,00:10:42.43,00:10:42.43,- Let's...
215,00:10:42.43,00:10:42.43,- I don't have to.
216,00:10:44.37,00:10:44.37,- You're not going to shake on the fact...
217,00:10:46.40,00:10:46.40,- I don't have to make another alliance.
218,00:10:48.10,00:10:48.10,"Today is the day we're going to go vote, and I don't want you to"
219,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,feel like you're obligated to me.
220,00:10:54.70,00:10:54.70,- I can't forget about what Tom has done for me in the past.
221,00:10:56.97,00:10:56.97,We could thank each other equally for still being here.
222,00:11:00.80,00:11:00.80,So I would not feel right about cutting him off at the knees
223,00:11:04.83,00:11:04.83,because on a couple of occasions he's fallen from grace.
224,00:11:11.10,00:11:11.10,"- You know, the handshake's a big deal to him."
225,00:11:12.83,00:11:12.83,"He said, ""I already shook your hand once,"
226,00:11:14.23,00:11:14.23,"I don't need to shake it again."""
227,00:11:16.67,00:11:16.67,"I said, ""All right."""
228,00:11:20.07,00:11:20.07,- We're taking a gamble bringing Tom in.
229,00:11:22.87,00:11:22.87,"- Yes, we are."
230,00:11:23.93,00:11:23.93,"But, I mean, are you willing at"
231,00:11:25.53,00:11:25.53,this point to dissolve the original pact?
232,00:11:28.67,00:11:28.67,"- No, I'm not."
233,00:11:29.83,00:11:29.83,- And I'm not either.
234,00:11:40.73,00:11:40.73,"- Last night and this morning, there were some tough and trying"
235,00:11:43.50,00:11:43.50,"times, so we decided to take some time and go up to Bull"
236,00:11:46.60,00:11:46.60,Rocks and just sort of Zen-out for a while.
237,00:11:50.97,00:11:50.97,What a view.
238,00:11:52.13,00:11:52.13,- Isn't it incredible?
239,00:11:54.97,00:11:54.97,"- When you go up to Bull Rocks, it's so peaceful, and we can"
240,00:11:57.97,00:11:57.97,"also get a look down at our boma, which gives you a"
241,00:12:00.77,00:12:00.77,"different perspective on things, and you just can't help but"
242,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,think about stuff.
243,00:12:05.37,00:12:05.37,- We've been living in that little circle for 36 days.
244,00:12:08.90,00:12:08.90,- Yeah.
245,00:12:11.03,00:12:11.03,- This has been the ultimate adventure for me.
246,00:12:14.20,00:12:14.20,"Every little bit of myself,"
247,00:12:15.80,00:12:15.80,my being has been touched in some little way.
248,00:12:18.67,00:12:18.67,- It really says the remoteness of the whole thing.
249,00:12:23.77,00:12:23.77,"- To walk away with that million takes a lot of luck,"
250,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,and so far I've been pretty lucky.
251,00:12:29.03,00:12:29.03,I'm just extremely happy that I made it this far.
252,00:12:32.63,00:12:32.63,So I'm going to suck it in a little bit and enjoy it.
253,00:12:37.00,00:12:37.00,"- Three more days, we can't see this anymore."
254,00:12:39.23,00:12:39.23,"- Take it all in, cowboys."
255,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,It feels great to be the last woman standing.
256,00:12:44.77,00:12:44.77,"I may make it to the final three,"
257,00:12:45.80,00:12:45.80,but I have to do that on my own power.
258,00:12:47.67,00:12:47.67,I have not won an immunity challenge yet.
259,00:12:49.80,00:12:49.80,I have not won a reward challenge either.
260,00:12:51.73,00:12:51.73,"But that's not to say that it can't happen,"
261,00:12:53.17,00:12:53.17,and nobody would be happier than me if I could pull it off
262,00:12:56.40,00:12:56.40,and buy myself another day or two here.
263,00:13:01.40,00:13:01.40,"- Playing the game for me, at this point,"
264,00:13:02.73,00:13:02.73,has become all about winning.
265,00:13:05.53,00:13:05.53,"Damn it, I'm going to walk away with that prize."
266,00:13:09.77,00:13:09.77,"I am here for one thing and one thing only, to take that million"
267,00:13:13.83,00:13:13.83,"dollars, and to run with it, it's mine."
268,00:13:25.93,00:13:25.93,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
269,00:13:37.63,00:13:37.63,- Torch.
270,00:13:40.03,00:13:40.03,A torch with a message.
271,00:13:41.93,00:13:41.93,"- Oh, wow."
272,00:13:44.37,00:13:44.37,"- ""Names of dogs, college degrees,"
273,00:13:46.03,00:13:46.03,"""I hope you paid attention."
274,00:13:48.80,00:13:48.80,"You may just be the next to go if your memory lacks retention."""
275,00:13:56.30,00:13:56.30,- What's your name again?
276,00:13:58.67,00:13:58.67,"We're going to have to answer questions about ourselves,"
277,00:14:00.80,00:14:00.80,"about past members of Moto Maji, you know,"
278,00:14:04.13,00:14:04.13,people that are on the jury right now.
279,00:14:06.23,00:14:06.23,And whoever gets the most
280,00:14:07.53,00:14:07.53,"questions right, then they get immunity."
281,00:14:10.97,00:14:10.97,- Who were Frank's other kids name?
282,00:14:12.90,00:14:12.90,- Hunter and Sage and what?
283,00:14:15.00,00:14:15.00,- I don't know.
284,00:14:16.70,00:14:16.70,"- That's another mental game, and I'm not that strong in that"
285,00:14:19.33,00:14:19.33,"game, and it will be tough with me."
286,00:14:23.27,00:14:23.27,"- Hunter, Sage and..."
287,00:14:24.83,00:14:24.83,"- Tom, I have no idea."
288,00:14:27.77,00:14:27.77,One thing that I'm worried about is
289,00:14:29.23,00:14:29.23,"if I get a question wrong, about one of the jurors that,"
290,00:14:33.03,00:14:33.03,"you know, I was supposedly close with,"
291,00:14:34.77,00:14:34.77,it could play a little bit on the jurors if they just think
292,00:14:37.13,00:14:37.13,you went through the motion of pretending to ask them important
293,00:14:39.53,00:14:39.53,questions and not really listening to the answers.
294,00:14:42.70,00:14:42.70,- I think Kim's going to be strong.
295,00:14:43.87,00:14:43.87,"- I do, too."
296,00:14:45.03,00:14:45.03,"- If she is, it's bones-to-bones tonight,"
297,00:14:46.47,00:14:46.47,isn't it?
298,00:14:46.47,00:14:46.47,- Yep.
299,00:14:48.67,00:14:48.67,- I think Kim has got the best chance
300,00:14:49.70,00:14:49.70,at winning this challenge.
301,00:14:50.97,00:14:50.97,"She's got a really good mind for facts,"
302,00:14:52.27,00:14:52.27,"she's got really good retention,"
303,00:14:53.57,00:14:53.57,and she takes a genuine interest in everybody.
304,00:14:55.90,00:14:55.90,"- You ready, Lex?"
305,00:14:58.83,00:14:58.83,"Okay, guys."
306,00:15:11.10,00:15:11.10,"- (Probst) Hi, Lex."
307,00:15:14.47,00:15:14.47,Ethan.
308,00:15:16.80,00:15:16.80,"What's up, Big Tom?"
309,00:15:17.83,00:15:17.83,"- Hi, Jeff."
310,00:15:18.90,00:15:18.90,"- (Probst) Hey, Kim."
311,00:15:22.20,00:15:22.20,We'll now bring in the members of our jury.
312,00:15:41.50,00:15:41.50,"Tonight's immunity challenge is called ""Fallen Comrades."""
313,00:15:45.60,00:15:45.60,We're going to reveal how much
314,00:15:47.00,00:15:47.00,you guys have learned about your fellow tribe members.
315,00:15:49.97,00:15:49.97,You've had a lot of conversations.
316,00:15:51.37,00:15:51.37,How much listening have you really done?
317,00:15:53.33,00:15:53.33,"We're holding it at Tribal Council, because ultimately this"
318,00:15:55.40,00:15:55.40,"is a game about relationships, and the final vote will come"
319,00:15:59.27,00:15:59.27,down to the relationships you
320,00:16:00.93,00:16:00.93,have formed with the members of the jury.
321,00:16:03.53,00:16:03.53,It will be followed by Tribal Council with a 13th member
322,00:16:06.00,00:16:06.00,who will be voted out.
323,00:16:07.90,00:16:07.90,I'm going to ask you eight questions about the original
324,00:16:09.93,00:16:09.93,tribe mates you spent time with over the last 36 days.
325,00:16:13.73,00:16:13.73,Whoever has the most right at the end of the competition
326,00:16:16.10,00:16:16.10,wins immunity.
327,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,"First thing, Lex, I'll take this back."
328,00:16:26.40,00:16:26.40,"Before I ask the questions,"
329,00:16:27.53,00:16:27.53,I want to make sure you know the rules.
330,00:16:29.37,00:16:29.37,"I'll ask you the question, write down your answer,"
331,00:16:31.13,00:16:31.13,don't reveal until I tell you to.
332,00:16:33.90,00:16:33.90,First question...
333,00:16:35.23,00:16:35.23,what rank did Frank reach in the Army?
334,00:16:40.27,00:16:40.27,What rank did Frank reach in the Army?

339,00:16:58.03,00:16:58.03,Tom says Lieutenant Private.
340,00:17:00.67,00:17:00.67,"Correct answer, Staff Sergeant."
341,00:17:03.27,00:17:03.27,Nobody gets it right.
342,00:17:04.30,00:17:04.30,Move onto the next question.

403,00:20:35.67,00:20:35.67,"Who are Sage, Hunter and Jocelyn Rose?"
404,00:20:40.57,00:20:40.57,"Who are Sage, Hunter and Jocelyn Rose?"
405,00:20:48.30,00:20:48.30,Everybody reveal.
406,00:20:49.73,00:20:49.73,Kim says Frank's children.
407,00:20:52.40,00:20:52.40,"Ethan, Frank's kids."
408,00:20:54.27,00:20:54.27,"Lex, Frank's kids."
409,00:20:55.73,00:20:55.73,"Big Tom, Frank's kids."
410,00:20:57.30,00:20:57.30,Everybody right.
411,00:20:59.10,00:20:59.10,Going into the last question.
412,00:21:00.47,00:21:00.47,"Kim, Lex, Big Tom, all have six."
413,00:21:02.63,00:21:02.63,Ethan has five.
414,00:21:05.47,00:21:05.47,Which female Survivor does not
415,00:21:07.53,00:21:07.53,"have anything pierced, including her ears?"
416,00:21:12.43,00:21:12.43,Which female Survivor does not
417,00:21:14.50,00:21:14.50,"have anything pierced, including her ears?"
418,00:21:19.83,00:21:19.83,Keep this last answer very private.
419,00:21:35.73,00:21:35.73,"If you're going take a guess, make one now."
420,00:21:40.87,00:21:40.87,"All right, on this reveal,"
421,00:21:42.30,00:21:42.30,I need you guys to do it one at a time.
422,00:21:45.17,00:21:45.17,Wait until I tell you.
423,00:21:47.43,00:21:47.43,"Let's start with you, Kim."
424,00:21:50.60,00:21:50.60,"Kim wrote Kelly, that's correct."
425,00:21:52.93,00:21:52.93,That gives you seven right.
426,00:21:54.43,00:21:54.43,"Ethan, show me what you have."
427,00:21:57.33,00:21:57.33,Linda... is wrong.
428,00:21:58.53,00:21:58.53,You're out of the game.
429,00:21:59.97,00:21:59.97,"Lex... Lindsey, you're wrong."
430,00:22:02.60,00:22:02.60,You're out of game.
431,00:22:04.33,00:22:04.33,"Big Tom, this is what it comes down to."
432,00:22:07.13,00:22:07.13,"You have Jessie, wrong."
433,00:22:09.13,00:22:09.13,"The game is over, Kim, congratulations."
434,00:22:12.87,00:22:12.87,Well earned.
435,00:22:16.03,00:22:16.03,"Slide it on, it's the first time you've had it."
436,00:22:19.20,00:22:19.20,Enjoy it.
437,00:22:20.30,00:22:20.30,- Congratulations.
438,00:22:21.57,00:22:21.57,- Thank you.
439,00:22:23.70,00:22:23.70,"- (Probst) So, Kim, you're immune from the vote tonight,"
440,00:22:26.57,00:22:26.57,guaranteed yourself a spot in the final three.
441,00:22:29.03,00:22:29.03,You also have assured yourself that you'll take part in
442,00:22:31.27,00:22:31.27,"tomorrow's final immunity challenge, which means you will"
443,00:22:33.00,00:22:33.00,have participated in every
444,00:22:34.57,00:22:34.57,"single challenge we've had, a great achievement."
445,00:22:37.90,00:22:37.90,Congratulations.
446,00:22:38.93,00:22:38.93,- Thank you.
447,00:22:40.17,00:22:40.17,- (Probst) It's time now to vote.
448,00:22:41.73,00:22:41.73,Obviously the only person you can't vote for is Kim.
449,00:22:44.70,00:22:44.70,The other three of you are fair game.
450,00:22:48.10,00:22:48.10,Somebody is going home.
451,00:22:49.10,00:22:49.10,Let's find out.
452,00:22:50.20,00:22:50.20,"Kim, you're up first."
453,00:23:05.90,00:23:05.90,"- Sorry, buddy, you were great fun, but you started playing"
454,00:23:08.67,00:23:08.67,"that manipulating game, setting one person up against the other."
455,00:23:11.73,00:23:11.73,That just doesn't cut it with me.
456,00:23:37.43,00:23:37.43,- This is the exact thing I didn't want to happen.
457,00:23:41.17,00:23:41.17,"It's not personal, it's every man for himself,"
458,00:23:43.50,00:23:43.50,and I have no prayer of beating you against the jury.
459,00:23:47.80,00:23:47.80,I respect you more than anything in the world.
460,00:23:50.27,00:23:50.27,"You carried me all the way, and I thank you for that."
461,00:24:15.83,00:24:15.83,"- Boys, it's been a hell of a bunch of fun."
462,00:24:20.00,00:24:20.00,We have kicked ass all the way from 16 and would have done it
463,00:24:23.67,00:24:23.67,"again tonight, but not one got immunity, so best of luck."
464,00:24:29.27,00:24:29.27,It's been fun.
465,00:24:30.67,00:24:30.67,One of us has got to run.
466,00:24:39.23,00:24:39.23,- I'll go tally the votes.
467,00:24:54.33,00:24:54.33,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
468,00:24:56.57,00:24:56.57,The person will be asked to leave
469,00:24:57.70,00:24:57.70,the Tribal Council area immediately.
470,00:25:00.33,00:25:00.33,I'll read the votes.
471,00:25:04.73,00:25:04.73,"First vote, Tom."
472,00:25:12.27,00:25:12.27,Lex.
473,00:25:14.70,00:25:14.70,"One vote Tom, one vote Lex."
474,00:25:20.83,00:25:20.83,Two votes Tom.
475,00:25:26.30,00:25:26.30,"Last vote, Big Tom."
476,00:25:30.17,00:25:30.17,You need to bring me your torch.
477,00:25:35.77,00:25:35.77,- Enjoyed it.
478,00:25:47.60,00:25:47.60,- (Probst) Big Tom.
479,00:25:48.93,00:25:48.93,"- Good-bye, Jeff, thank you."
480,00:25:50.13,00:25:50.13,- The tribe has spoken.
481,00:25:56.10,00:25:56.10,It's time for you to go.
482,00:25:57.23,00:25:57.23,Good-bye.
483,00:26:10.23,00:26:10.23,"- It's come down to this-- three people,"
484,00:26:12.13,00:26:12.13,one immunity challenge left.
485,00:26:13.83,00:26:13.83,"Win, you're in the final two."
486,00:26:16.17,00:26:16.17,"Get a good night's sleep, you're going to need it."
487,00:26:18.70,00:26:18.70,You can head back to camp.
488,00:26:21.30,00:26:21.30,"- Well, well, look at old Big Tom now."
489,00:26:24.13,00:26:24.13,Whew!
490,00:26:25.83,00:26:25.83,It's been a journey.
491,00:26:27.43,00:26:27.43,"I do want to say a special thanks to Lex, Ethan, for making"
492,00:26:31.23,00:26:31.23,"an alliance with me, and being"
493,00:26:35.10,00:26:35.10,man enough to stay with their alliance.
494,00:26:37.90,00:26:37.90,"Without y'all, I couldn't have made it this far."
495,00:26:39.80,00:26:39.80,"Hey, love, peace, and higher grace."
496,00:26:44.73,00:26:44.73,Big Tom will talk to you later.
497,00:26:46.47,00:26:46.47,(clucks tongue)
498,00:27:07.80,00:27:07.80,"- (Probst) Lex, Ethan, good morning!"
499,00:27:11.17,00:27:11.17,"Hey, day 38 is here, buddy."
500,00:27:14.60,00:27:14.60,Let's go.
501,00:27:15.87,00:27:15.87,- What up?
502,00:27:16.97,00:27:16.97,"Come on in, buddy."
503,00:27:18.77,00:27:18.77,"- Let's go, come on."
504,00:27:19.80,00:27:19.80,- Where are we going?
505,00:27:22.23,00:27:22.23,"- (Probst) We got a big, fun day."
506,00:27:23.27,00:27:23.27,How was night watch?
507,00:27:24.47,00:27:24.47,"- Good, uneventful."
508,00:27:25.87,00:27:25.87,- It sucked... I had... all night.
509,00:27:27.93,00:27:27.93,- You were no help with the night watch.
510,00:27:30.23,00:27:30.23,- Are they gone?
511,00:27:31.70,00:27:31.70,"- Well, about 30 minutes ago they weren't."
512,00:27:34.20,00:27:34.20,We'll see.
513,00:27:36.80,00:27:36.80,"- I was up pretty much all night, with just diarrhea,"
514,00:27:41.83,00:27:41.83,"I was cramping up pretty bad this morning,"
515,00:27:44.37,00:27:44.37,couldn't really hold down water.
516,00:27:45.77,00:27:45.77,It's just one of those things.
517,00:27:47.30,00:27:47.30,"- You went 12, 13 times last night?"
518,00:27:49.13,00:27:49.13,- At least.
519,00:27:50.17,00:27:50.17,It just didn't stop.
520,00:27:51.83,00:27:51.83,The game of Survivor never takes a time-out.
521,00:27:53.70,00:27:53.70,It's the real deal.
522,00:27:54.77,00:27:54.77,You come out here for 39 days
523,00:27:56.27,00:27:56.27,"and if, at any point during those 39 days,"
524,00:27:59.07,00:27:59.07,you're not 100% on your game or something happens
525,00:28:01.70,00:28:01.70,"to you, that's just tough."
526,00:28:06.67,00:28:06.67,It is a road trip.
527,00:28:07.87,00:28:07.87,Just follow the moon.
528,00:28:09.20,00:28:09.20,"- You can't predict anything in this game,"
529,00:28:10.87,00:28:10.87,that's why it's an amazing game.
530,00:28:12.40,00:28:12.40,It's twists and turns and you can't control it and that makes
531,00:28:16.23,00:28:16.23,"it exciting, and frustrating and new,"
532,00:28:20.07,00:28:20.07,"you know, you can't predict anything."
533,00:28:42.53,00:28:42.53,- (Probst) This morning you will
534,00:28:44.60,00:28:44.60,participate in a final rite of passage.
535,00:28:47.90,00:28:47.90,This is a chance to think about what it took to get to day 38.
536,00:28:53.20,00:28:53.20,"This is a Samburu ritual, so we will follow their lead, always"
537,00:28:55.63,00:28:55.63,"walking north, fires on east and west, never looking back."
538,00:29:00.37,00:29:00.37,"It begins with a blessing from the elders, who will beckon the"
539,00:29:02.90,00:29:02.90,"spirits with their sticks, asking them to forgive you for"
540,00:29:07.03,00:29:07.03,"any wrongdoings you may have done to others, and you should"
541,00:29:09.53,00:29:09.53,also focus on what you need to get through these last two days.
542,00:29:12.93,00:29:12.93,"Continuing north, you'll follow a trail of staffs representing"
543,00:29:16.97,00:29:16.97,your fellow Survivors.
544,00:29:19.40,00:29:19.40,This is a chance for you to reflect on the impact the former
545,00:29:22.03,00:29:22.03,tribe members have had on your
546,00:29:23.73,00:29:23.73,life and the impact you've had on their life.
547,00:29:26.80,00:29:26.80,"You'll then come upon a group of Samburu tribe members, who will"
548,00:29:29.83,00:29:29.83,"lead you through a ceremonial cleansing,"
549,00:29:32.23,00:29:32.23,which represents new life.
550,00:29:35.23,00:29:35.23,Your new life.
551,00:29:36.90,00:29:36.90,A mixture of goat fat and blood will be washed over your body
552,00:29:40.43,00:29:40.43,and you'll then be asked to celebrate your rebirth.
553,00:29:43.77,00:29:43.77,This is for you.
554,00:29:45.80,00:29:45.80,I encourage you to give yourself over to the experience.
555,00:29:50.80,00:29:50.80,It's yours.
556,00:29:52.67,00:29:52.67,Begin.
557,00:29:56.97,00:29:56.97,(chanting in native language)
558,00:30:23.47,00:30:23.47,"- I'm 42, this is a chance of a lifetime for me."
559,00:30:27.13,00:30:27.13,"I've done something that, you know, I wanted to do,"
560,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,and that just makes my life better.
561,00:30:31.50,00:30:31.50,That's really what counts to me.
562,00:30:36.23,00:30:36.23,"- It is very hard out here,"
563,00:30:38.43,00:30:38.43,harder than I ever expected it to be.
564,00:30:40.13,00:30:40.13,I think I've accomplished enough just by being here.
565,00:30:44.80,00:30:44.80,"- I do have a charmed and wonderful life, I appreciate it"
566,00:30:47.53,00:30:47.53,"more since I've been out here, because the little things that"
567,00:30:50.00,00:30:50.00,"you take for granted like turning on that faucet of water,"
568,00:30:53.03,00:30:53.03,"crawling in at bed at night, you don't have that here in Africa."
569,00:30:57.57,00:30:57.57,"- Mother Africa is just this wonderful, wonderful place."
570,00:31:02.57,00:31:02.57,"I've grown, I've learned, it was an amazing adventure."
571,00:31:11.10,00:31:11.10,"- I had planned on winning the whole thing, obviously, I mean,"
572,00:31:12.57,00:31:12.57,you come here to win.
573,00:31:14.10,00:31:14.10,"You know, it was an unbelievable experience, unbelievable game."
574,00:31:16.63,00:31:16.63,"I'd play the game tomorrow, I'd play it next year."
575,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,- I'm an athlete.
576,00:31:22.13,00:31:22.13,"I love to compete, but I'd much rather do it in a civilized"
577,00:31:24.50,00:31:24.50,environment where I'm not
578,00:31:25.67,00:31:25.67,battling manipulation and back-stabbing.
579,00:31:29.97,00:31:29.97,This game is a serious emotional roller-coaster ride.
580,00:31:34.90,00:31:34.90,"- I kind of assumed a leadership role from like,"
581,00:31:36.77,00:31:36.77,"day one, and then the incident with Diane"
582,00:31:38.50,00:31:38.50,"kind of like, threw me down to the bottom."
583,00:31:41.27,00:31:41.27,"I went from, like, the CEO of the company to the janitor."
584,00:31:46.40,00:31:46.40,- I can't help but be myself.
585,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,"It was hard for me not to have friends in different places,"
586,00:31:51.03,00:31:51.03,"and that kind of screwed me, but hey, I made it past the hard"
587,00:31:53.30,00:31:53.30,part with the boulders and whatnot.
588,00:31:55.07,00:31:55.07,"And for a skinny girl, you know, it's a big deal."
589,00:31:59.20,00:31:59.20,- The funniest thing that I'm going to miss
590,00:32:00.57,00:32:00.57,the most is the challenges.
591,00:32:02.37,00:32:02.37,"I had come in like second or third on all the challenges, me."
592,00:32:05.97,00:32:05.97,I won that one with Frank that
593,00:32:07.23,00:32:07.23,"was like the most physical one we've had,"
594,00:32:09.23,00:32:09.23,and nobody will ever take me for granted again.
595,00:32:13.97,00:32:13.97,- Not only is the game a challenge to me physically and
596,00:32:16.50,00:32:16.50,"mentally for my competitive spirit, but just being out here"
597,00:32:19.13,00:32:19.13,in this isolation under these conditions is also therapeutic.
598,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,- The game isn't really ever been about the money for me.
599,00:32:27.67,00:32:27.67,"It's been about coming out here and doing something like this,"
600,00:32:29.97,00:32:29.97,which is just an amazing experience.
601,00:32:33.07,00:32:33.07,"When you take a step back, you're like wow, I mean, who"
602,00:32:34.67,00:32:34.67,gets this kind of opportunity in their life?
603,00:32:39.10,00:32:39.10,"- Out here, you can't be as vocal as you might be back home."
604,00:32:42.73,00:32:42.73,"Because if you are, you might"
605,00:32:44.03,00:32:44.03,not be here long and that's just part of the game.
606,00:32:51.40,00:32:51.40,- I have met 16 of the greatest
607,00:32:54.10,00:32:54.10,individuals that I have ever met in my life.
608,00:32:56.83,00:32:56.83,Some I like more than the others.
609,00:32:58.53,00:32:58.53,"They were all unique kind of people, and damn, what a ride."
610,00:33:09.63,00:33:09.63,(chanting)
611,00:33:31.47,00:33:31.47,(chanting)

614,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,(rhythmic clapping)

619,00:35:50.60,00:35:50.60,"- (Probst) This is your final immunity challenge, comes down"
620,00:35:52.87,00:35:52.87,to one quality-- willpower.
621,00:35:56.23,00:35:56.23,How badly do you want this?
622,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,This is your final endurance test.
623,00:36:00.57,00:36:00.57,"Put one hand on the idol, each foot on a stump."
624,00:36:04.30,00:36:04.30,"Once you commit your hand and your feet, you can't move them."
625,00:36:07.63,00:36:07.63,"Last person left standing goes to the final two, and just as"
626,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,"importantly, decides who goes with them for that final vote."
627,00:36:15.03,00:36:15.03,Take your positions.
628,00:36:16.10,00:36:16.10,Wait for my go.
629,00:36:24.43,00:36:24.43,"Guys just remember, keep your"
630,00:36:25.93,00:36:25.93,"feet on the wood, and be careful with your hands."
631,00:36:29.27,00:36:29.27,Don't lose contact with the idol.
632,00:36:31.03,00:36:31.03,Don't lose your concentration.
633,00:36:32.63,00:36:32.63,The game is on.
634,00:36:57.90,00:36:57.90,"Well, the good news is you guys have lasted an hour."
635,00:37:01.07,00:37:01.07,The bad news is it's only 9:00 a.m.
636,00:37:03.10,00:37:03.10,The sun hasn't even begun to heat up yet.
637,00:37:06.40,00:37:06.40,"Stay strong, remember, keep your"
638,00:37:07.67,00:37:07.67,"feet on the logs, your hand on the idol."
639,00:37:10.47,00:37:10.47,You guys have come a long way.
640,00:37:41.47,00:37:41.47,Another update for you.
641,00:37:43.50,00:37:43.50,Two hours.
642,00:37:44.63,00:37:44.63,"It's got to feel like a lot longer,"
643,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,the sun is as hot as it has ever been.
644,00:37:48.90,00:37:48.90,"Draw on whatever you have left, keep your hand on that idol."
645,00:38:01.33,00:38:01.33,"Ethan, your foot came off, after two hours, 26 minutes,"
646,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,you're out of the game.
647,00:38:13.13,00:38:13.13,- We're nuts doing this.
648,00:38:14.47,00:38:14.47,I should be old enough to know better.
649,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,"- No matter what you guys are feeling, keep going, all right,"
650,00:38:32.00,00:38:32.00,because it doesn't feel good to let go.
651,00:38:36.77,00:38:36.77,Give it everything you've got.
652,00:38:37.87,00:38:37.87,Don't leave anything up there.
653,00:38:39.53,00:38:39.53,All right?
654,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,- Thanks.
655,00:38:48.20,00:38:48.20,"- I worked my butt off to get right here, and I go and I blow"
656,00:38:50.43,00:38:50.43,it on such a silly little mistake.
657,00:38:55.97,00:38:55.97,I just lost concentration.
658,00:38:58.07,00:38:58.07,"My back foot came off, and that's the killer."
659,00:39:01.13,00:39:01.13,I can never ever get to that spot again.
660,00:39:03.43,00:39:03.43,It feels horrible.
661,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,It feels horrible.
662,00:39:11.90,00:39:11.90,- You're still in the game.
663,00:39:13.57,00:39:13.57,- I pretend I'm someplace else.
664,00:39:14.77,00:39:14.77,- Where are you?
665,00:39:16.00,00:39:16.00,"- Lying on the beach, roasting in the sun,"
666,00:39:18.83,00:39:18.83,with a Planter's Punch at my side.
667,00:39:21.70,00:39:21.70,"- You figure six, seven, eight more hours of this?"
668,00:39:33.87,00:39:33.87,"- Kim looks strong, but Lex is just as strong."
669,00:39:37.93,00:39:37.93,"Neither of them will give up, because they want the choice to"
670,00:39:41.07,00:39:41.07,bring whoever they want to the final two.
671,00:39:49.93,00:39:49.93,- My belly is going to... you know.
672,00:39:51.47,00:39:51.47,- Huh?
673,00:39:52.57,00:39:52.57,- My belly's gonna...
674,00:39:54.17,00:39:54.17,"- Got the worst of it over, right?"
675,00:39:55.60,00:39:55.60,"- Yeah, it's just... I'm just drained."
676,00:39:59.70,00:39:59.70,- Lex had problems with his stomach all night last night.
677,00:40:03.30,00:40:03.30,"He was up like, ten times going to the bathroom."
678,00:40:06.60,00:40:06.60,I'm sure he's dehydrated.
679,00:40:08.50,00:40:08.50,The sun is ridiculous right now.
680,00:40:10.93,00:40:10.93,It's hot.
681,00:40:36.97,00:40:36.97,"- (Probst) Lex, you're out."
682,00:40:39.37,00:40:39.37,"Three hours, 21 minutes."
683,00:40:41.53,00:40:41.53,"Kim, you have immunity."
684,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,"- The final immunity challenge was not luck, was not being"
685,00:40:52.23,00:40:52.23,"nice, was not any of the things that I had done so far."
686,00:40:55.43,00:40:55.43,"That was something that came out of me inside of me,"
687,00:40:59.07,00:40:59.07,"a determination that I haven't seen in me, maybe ever."
688,00:41:07.50,00:41:07.50,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
689,00:41:23.37,00:41:23.37,"- In your wildest dreams, you know, things like this happen."
690,00:41:25.80,00:41:25.80,"It doesn't ever really happen to you,"
691,00:41:27.43,00:41:27.43,but it shows that dreams come true.
692,00:41:29.47,00:41:29.47,I never thought I'd see this again.
693,00:41:32.03,00:41:32.03,I thought I'd... I never thought I'd see it ever.
694,00:41:35.23,00:41:35.23,"- You've got a little streak going on, huh?"
695,00:41:38.13,00:41:38.13,- I never thought I'd see it ever.
696,00:41:40.53,00:41:40.53,"I'm very stunned now that I'm in the final two, when I can"
697,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,"remember thinking the first night here, ""Oh, my God,"
698,00:41:47.87,00:41:47.87,"I'm going to be the first one voted off."""
699,00:41:50.50,00:41:50.50,"Lex, Ethan, let's go."
700,00:42:03.37,00:42:03.37,- I'm glad the three of us are here... you know?
701,00:42:06.70,00:42:06.70,"- Thank you, I'm glad we're here, too."
702,00:42:08.97,00:42:08.97,- It's a good...
703,00:42:10.23,00:42:10.23,"- We had a good bond, right from the beginning."
704,00:42:12.43,00:42:12.43,"- We all needed each other to get here, that's for sure."
705,00:42:14.33,00:42:14.33,"- Yeah, that's for sure."
706,00:42:15.70,00:42:15.70,"- You know, what will be weighing heavy on our minds and"
707,00:42:18.60,00:42:18.60,on our hearts today is wondering which one of us is out of the
708,00:42:23.03,00:42:23.03,game tonight and which one of us is going to be here until the
709,00:42:26.70,00:42:26.70,"very end, until the final two."
710,00:42:28.63,00:42:28.63,"Only one of us can stay, and that's all up to Mama Cat."
711,00:42:32.43,00:42:32.43,"Regardless of what happens, I was proud to play the game with"
712,00:42:35.13,00:42:35.13,you and I was proud to have an alliance with you.
713,00:42:37.30,00:42:37.30,"- Me, too."
714,00:42:38.53,00:42:38.53,- Really. I mean it.
715,00:42:40.93,00:42:40.93,- It worked out really well.
716,00:42:44.23,00:42:44.23,My destiny is definitely in
717,00:42:45.70,00:42:45.70,"someone else's hands, and it's a scary feeling."
718,00:42:48.27,00:42:48.27,I've never been in that
719,00:42:49.93,00:42:49.93,"situation before, and I feel very vulnerable."
720,00:42:53.23,00:42:53.23,"You know, my stomach's in knots."
721,00:42:54.80,00:42:54.80,I don't know what to think.
722,00:42:56.23,00:42:56.23,"I mean, I could be going home tonight."
723,00:42:57.73,00:42:57.73,"I could... you know, I could be here tomorrow."
724,00:43:01.27,00:43:01.27,You might understand because you've been aligned with Lex and
725,00:43:04.47,00:43:04.47,it's probably a big decision for you.
726,00:43:06.13,00:43:06.13,"- It's a hard decision anyway,"
727,00:43:07.97,00:43:07.97,"you know, making two when there are three."
728,00:43:10.60,00:43:10.60,"- You've got a really, really hard job ahead of you."
729,00:43:13.63,00:43:13.63,- I'm just trying to think of all kinds of things that would
730,00:43:16.63,00:43:16.63,"make me be able to make a decision easier,"
731,00:43:19.40,00:43:19.40,do you know what I mean?
732,00:43:20.70,00:43:20.70,"I mean, I love you both equally, absolutely equally."
733,00:43:23.47,00:43:23.47,- I know.
734,00:43:24.50,00:43:24.50,- It's just... it's just horrible.
735,00:43:26.53,00:43:26.53,"I mean, it's not just the biggest decision here."
736,00:43:28.57,00:43:28.57,It's probably one of the biggest decisions in my life.
737,00:43:30.87,00:43:30.87,"- You're in a tough, tough, tough situation."
738,00:43:33.60,00:43:33.60,"When you won today, that was a bittersweet victory, but it also"
739,00:43:37.77,00:43:37.77,comes with great reward.
740,00:43:39.50,00:43:39.50,- Deciding who I'm going to vote off tonight would be more
741,00:43:42.93,00:43:42.93,of a strategic move if I thought one of the two of them would be
742,00:43:46.03,00:43:46.03,more easily beatable than the other.
743,00:43:47.90,00:43:47.90,And I wish that nobody had to feel bad about it.
744,00:43:50.17,00:43:50.17,That's the double-edged sword of winning this immunity.
745,00:43:53.67,00:43:53.67,"That I have to do, you know, something that will pain me and"
746,00:43:56.33,00:43:56.33,it will pain the person that I don't bring with me
747,00:43:57.63,00:43:57.63,to the final two.
748,00:43:59.43,00:43:59.43,There's nothing fun about that.
749,00:44:15.07,00:44:15.07,- We will now bring in the six members of our jury.
750,00:44:29.73,00:44:29.73,And then there were three.
751,00:44:32.20,00:44:32.20,"A long day today, it started very, very early."
752,00:44:36.40,00:44:36.40,Let's talk about the immunity challenge.
753,00:44:39.37,00:44:39.37,"Kim, today, in an absolute test of willpower,"
754,00:44:44.07,00:44:44.07,"you, a 56-year-old grandma, took on two young, fit,"
755,00:44:47.90,00:44:47.90,"able-bodied guys, and you kicked their ass."
756,00:44:50.87,00:44:50.87,You earned that immunity.
757,00:44:53.20,00:44:53.20,Tell me about it today.
758,00:44:55.37,00:44:55.37,"- It was strictly just stamina and guts going on, and there was"
759,00:44:59.17,00:44:59.17,something inside of me making me stay.
760,00:45:01.57,00:45:01.57,It went beyond the game.
761,00:45:03.03,00:45:03.03,"It was something that I needed to do for me, to show me that"
762,00:45:06.93,00:45:06.93,I could do something.
763,00:45:08.27,00:45:08.27,To will myself to do something
764,00:45:09.67,00:45:09.67,that I really didn't think I was capable of.
765,00:45:11.70,00:45:11.70,"- Ethan, what was it like for you?"
766,00:45:13.90,00:45:13.90,"It was tough, obviously."
767,00:45:15.20,00:45:15.20,- It was very tough for me.
768,00:45:16.87,00:45:16.87,"You know, I thought I would have done better, and you know,"
769,00:45:20.07,00:45:20.07,I thought I would have been stronger.
770,00:45:21.67,00:45:21.67,"You know, it's going to bug me for a while."
771,00:45:23.63,00:45:23.63,It's going to take a long time to be able to get over that.
772,00:45:26.50,00:45:26.50,"- Lex, you, too, were fighting it."
773,00:45:28.50,00:45:28.50,You hung on as long as you could.
774,00:45:30.20,00:45:30.20,What finally happened?
775,00:45:32.17,00:45:32.17,- It boiled down to a physical problem.
776,00:45:33.83,00:45:33.83,"I finally did not have the strength to stand anymore, and"
777,00:45:37.00,00:45:37.00,my mind and my will and my pride would have had me up there
778,00:45:41.10,00:45:41.10,another three hours.
779,00:45:42.40,00:45:42.40,"But my body wasn't ready to deliver, and it didn't."
780,00:45:46.53,00:45:46.53,And the strongest person won.
781,00:45:49.27,00:45:49.27,- Here's where we're at...
782,00:45:51.57,00:45:51.57,"You can't vote for Kim, she has immunity."
783,00:45:54.07,00:45:54.07,"The rules clearly state you can't vote for yourself,"
784,00:45:56.93,00:45:56.93,"which means Lex, you can only vote for Ethan."
785,00:45:59.23,00:45:59.23,"Ethan, you can only vote for Lex."
786,00:46:01.10,00:46:01.10,No need for you guys to vote.
787,00:46:02.50,00:46:02.50,Your votes nullify each other.
788,00:46:04.17,00:46:04.17,"Therefore, the only person who will vote tonight is Kim."
789,00:46:07.83,00:46:07.83,"Obviously, Kim, lots of reasons"
790,00:46:09.70,00:46:09.70,why you might pick one guy over another.
791,00:46:12.07,00:46:12.07,"The only question I have for you is,"
792,00:46:14.73,00:46:14.73,do you want to hear from these guys as to why they think
793,00:46:17.57,00:46:17.57,"they should stay, or have you already made up your mind?"
794,00:46:20.60,00:46:20.60,- I actually haven't made up my mind yet.
795,00:46:23.23,00:46:23.23,This is probably the most
796,00:46:24.87,00:46:24.87,bittersweet thing that's ever happened to me.
797,00:46:27.40,00:46:27.40,I just feel so bad that I can't choose both of them.
798,00:46:30.77,00:46:30.77,I almost wish that one of them had the immunity and I didn't
799,00:46:33.30,00:46:33.30,even have to make this decision.
800,00:46:34.77,00:46:34.77,If they have anything they would
801,00:46:36.27,00:46:36.27,"like to say, I would love to hear it."
802,00:46:38.03,00:46:38.03,"- Lex, anything you want to say?"
803,00:46:40.80,00:46:40.80,"- I want you to vote, vote your heart and don't look back"
804,00:46:44.70,00:46:44.70,and don't regret anything because...
805,00:46:47.63,00:46:47.63,it'll be all right.
806,00:46:48.93,00:46:48.93,And that's fine.
807,00:46:50.03,00:46:50.03,"- (Probst) How about you, Ethan?"
808,00:46:52.03,00:46:52.03,- Do what makes you feel good inside.
809,00:46:55.63,00:46:55.63,- I know.
810,00:46:57.53,00:46:57.53,"- (Probst) Okay, Kim."
811,00:46:58.77,00:46:58.77,And this is the last time you
812,00:47:00.60,00:47:00.60,will have any control over this game.
813,00:47:02.87,00:47:02.87,"After 38 days of being in control, after tonight's vote,"
814,00:47:06.97,00:47:06.97,all the power goes to the six members we already have on our
815,00:47:10.67,00:47:10.67,jury and the seventh that you're about to add.
816,00:47:13.77,00:47:13.77,Time to write down a name.
817,00:47:15.57,00:47:15.57,You're up.
818,00:47:37.10,00:47:37.10,- Please forgive me.
819,00:47:38.50,00:47:38.50,This is probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
820,00:47:41.53,00:47:41.53,"You've been an incredible competitor, a great friend."
821,00:47:46.13,00:47:46.13,"If I could come up with a wonderful reason,"
822,00:47:48.53,00:47:48.53,I'd love to give it to you.
823,00:47:50.03,00:47:50.03,I know we'll always be friends.
824,00:48:11.63,00:48:11.63,- I'll go tally the vote.
825,00:48:44.27,00:48:44.27,"Once the vote is read, the decision is final."
826,00:48:46.33,00:48:46.33,The person will be asked to leave
827,00:48:47.43,00:48:47.43,the Tribal Council area immediately.
828,00:48:49.50,00:48:49.50,I'll read the vote.
829,00:48:55.40,00:48:55.40,The 14th person voted out of the tribe...
830,00:48:59.63,00:48:59.63,Lex.
831,00:49:12.93,00:49:12.93,- Congratulations.
832,00:49:13.97,00:49:13.97,Good luck.
833,00:49:32.70,00:49:32.70,"- Lex, the tribe has spoken."
834,00:49:41.63,00:49:41.63,It's time for you to go.
835,00:49:57.00,00:49:57.00,The power is now completely in the hands of the jury.
836,00:50:00.93,00:50:00.93,You guys have tonight and tomorrow to think about what
837,00:50:03.33,00:50:03.33,you're going to say to convince seven people you just voted out
838,00:50:06.23,00:50:06.23,of this game to turn around and
839,00:50:08.13,00:50:08.13,vote for you and reward you with a million dollars.
840,00:50:10.80,00:50:10.80,You can head back to camp.
841,00:50:12.30,00:50:12.30,I'll see you tomorrow.
842,00:50:15.33,00:50:15.33,"- I can honestly say I spent 38 days here,"
843,00:50:18.70,00:50:18.70,I played as hard as I could.
844,00:50:20.67,00:50:20.67,I played straight and honest and true.
845,00:50:23.93,00:50:23.93,"And Mom Cat, I don't have any ill feelings."
846,00:50:27.87,00:50:27.87,I've got no problem with the vote that you cast tonight.
847,00:50:30.67,00:50:30.67,You had to vote for somebody.
848,00:50:32.13,00:50:32.13,It was a tough call.
849,00:50:33.17,00:50:33.17,- I'm sure he's really upset.
850,00:50:35.33,00:50:35.33,I did the right thing.
851,00:50:37.07,00:50:37.07,I really did the right thing.
852,00:50:39.37,00:50:39.37,- No regrets.
853,00:50:47.00,00:50:47.00,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
854,00:51:12.90,00:51:12.90,- Good morning.
855,00:51:13.90,00:51:13.90,- How are you?
856,00:51:16.90,00:51:16.90,It's hard to think no more nights.
857,00:51:19.27,00:51:19.27,"- No, it's not."
858,00:51:21.93,00:51:21.93,"- Final two, day 39."
859,00:51:24.23,00:51:24.23,I can't believe I'm even saying the words.
860,00:51:26.27,00:51:26.27,"Yesterday, I was concerned about having to vote off one of the"
861,00:51:28.43,00:51:28.43,"two guys, and today, I can just really... just relish being at"
862,00:51:32.53,00:51:32.53,the end here with Ethan and the final day.
863,00:51:35.47,00:51:35.47,- I'm just beside myself that I'm here.
864,00:51:37.90,00:51:37.90,"- Yeah, it's huge, Ethan, it's huge."
865,00:51:40.70,00:51:40.70,We've been waiting a long time for this.
866,00:51:43.70,00:51:43.70,- Today is a very good day.
867,00:51:46.47,00:51:46.47,"I am just feeling relief, a sense of joy, a sense of"
868,00:51:51.50,00:51:51.50,gratitude for Kim for choosing me.
869,00:51:53.40,00:51:53.40,- I really couldn't be here with a better person.
870,00:51:55.30,00:51:55.30,I am very excited about that.
871,00:51:56.57,00:51:56.57,"I mean that, you know, sincerely."
872,00:51:59.20,00:51:59.20,As the time drew closer to decide who to bring to the final
873,00:52:02.03,00:52:02.03,"two with me, the decision became harder and harder."
874,00:52:05.20,00:52:05.20,But I feel that Lex thought he deserved it.
875,00:52:08.27,00:52:08.27,"I'm not so sure that Ethan felt he deserved it, and maybe"
876,00:52:12.50,00:52:12.50,ultimately that's what made the decision easier for me.
877,00:52:15.87,00:52:15.87,- I only won two challenges.
878,00:52:17.20,00:52:17.20,"People might think,"
879,00:52:18.43,00:52:18.43,"""Well, just got lucky and fell into this."""
880,00:52:20.23,00:52:20.23,- You don't get here just by being a nice guy.
881,00:52:21.97,00:52:21.97,"I mean, you've got to do a lot of things right."
882,00:52:24.50,00:52:24.50,"I mean, there are things that"
883,00:52:25.83,00:52:25.83,you would do anyway just in your life.
884,00:52:27.60,00:52:27.60,"You know, you are who you are when you come here."
885,00:52:31.10,00:52:31.10,- That's what got you here.
886,00:52:32.43,00:52:32.43,"- I think that's what got you here,"
887,00:52:33.60,00:52:33.60,and that's what gets you through.
888,00:52:40.63,00:52:40.63,"- Kim, we have to cross off our days."
889,00:52:44.13,00:52:44.13,- Don't you think this whole thing will go down as one of the
890,00:52:46.57,00:52:46.57,ultimate experiences in your entire life?
891,00:52:48.20,00:52:48.20,- Yeah.
892,00:52:50.07,00:52:50.07,"- I thought this would never happen, didn't you?"
893,00:52:52.53,00:52:52.53,"- Yeah, never ever."
894,00:52:53.57,00:52:53.57,"38, good-bye."
895,00:52:58.67,00:52:58.67,- Go for it.
896,00:53:05.70,00:53:05.70,Put your initials down there
897,00:53:06.90,00:53:06.90,"somewhere, and I'll put my initials."
898,00:53:16.30,00:53:16.30,"Good, huh?"
899,00:53:17.97,00:53:17.97,- That's it.
900,00:53:17.97,00:53:17.97,- You like?
901,00:53:19.80,00:53:19.80,- I like. All done.
902,00:53:34.43,00:53:34.43,"- Tonight at Tribal Council, you know,"
903,00:53:37.00,00:53:37.00,I think it's going to be a one-vote jury.
904,00:53:38.80,00:53:38.80,"I see myself getting the guy votes, Lex and Tom and Frank."
905,00:53:43.37,00:53:43.37,"And I see Kim getting the girl votes, which is Kelly,"
906,00:53:46.03,00:53:46.03,Little Kim and Teresa.
907,00:53:48.03,00:53:48.03,And Brandon is going to be maybe the swing vote.
908,00:53:53.37,00:53:53.37,Say your peace now.
909,00:53:55.73,00:53:55.73,"Better take one last look, because you're never going to be"
910,00:53:58.40,00:53:58.40,in this spot again.
911,00:53:59.47,00:53:59.47,"- Yep, never again."
912,00:54:01.83,00:54:01.83,- All right.
913,00:54:21.27,00:54:21.27,- You think they'll just...
914,00:54:23.13,00:54:23.13,- I'm hoping it's not.
915,00:54:24.63,00:54:24.63,"I mean, you know, hopefully Tom will lighten it up a bit maybe,"
916,00:54:27.87,00:54:27.87,but Lex is going to ask a deep question.
917,00:54:30.97,00:54:30.97,So they're going to be deep and they're going to be heavy.
918,00:54:44.13,00:54:44.13,"- I guess the experience tonight,"
919,00:54:46.23,00:54:46.23,it'll probably be tense.
920,00:54:48.13,00:54:48.13,It's a big deal that now I'll have to decide which person is
921,00:54:51.53,00:54:51.53,"the one that deserves to win, and not only win the money,"
922,00:54:54.77,00:54:54.77,but deserves to win the game.
923,00:54:56.33,00:54:56.33,"And to me, that's really important."
924,00:54:59.07,00:54:59.07,You might say they were an
925,00:55:00.53,00:55:00.53,unlikely pair to make it this far.
926,00:55:02.50,00:55:02.50,"If you were placing bets at the beginning of the game, you'd"
927,00:55:04.70,00:55:04.70,probably say that Kim might have gone early because she was
928,00:55:07.83,00:55:07.83,oldest and you might have thought weakest.
929,00:55:10.80,00:55:10.80,"And Ethan, you might have thought might go far, because"
930,00:55:14.30,00:55:14.30,"he's going to hide under the radar for a while, but, at some"
931,00:55:16.27,00:55:16.27,"point in time, he's just not"
932,00:55:17.90,00:55:17.90,going to have bonded with people.
933,00:55:19.83,00:55:19.83,So it's interesting that an introvert and the oldest person
934,00:55:21.80,00:55:21.80,in the tribe are the last two left.
935,00:55:29.23,00:55:29.23,- No one ends up in the final two by luck or coincidence.
936,00:55:33.47,00:55:33.47,You can end up maybe in the final four by being lucky.
937,00:55:37.97,00:55:37.97,"But, when you're in the final two, that's on your own valor"
938,00:55:40.80,00:55:40.80,and that's on your own merit.
939,00:55:42.23,00:55:42.23,What's going to be really interesting about tonight's
940,00:55:44.23,00:55:44.23,Tribal Council is that you look at the seven members of
941,00:55:47.60,00:55:47.60,"the jury, and they are all over the map."
942,00:55:50.33,00:55:50.33,They run the gamut.
943,00:55:51.63,00:55:51.63,You've got all different kinds of people with different
944,00:55:54.50,00:55:54.50,"opinions of the final two, and it is still anyone's game."
945,00:56:02.73,00:56:02.73,"- Tonight's Tribal Council, for me, will be bittersweet."
946,00:56:06.23,00:56:06.23,"Number one, the game is over."
947,00:56:08.90,00:56:08.90,"Number two, I didn't get as far as I would have liked to have"
948,00:56:11.30,00:56:11.30,"gone, which would have been first or second."
949,00:56:13.43,00:56:13.43,Ideally first.
950,00:56:15.17,00:56:15.17,Also bittersweet because the two people that I'm trying to make
951,00:56:18.30,00:56:18.30,a decision on are two people that
952,00:56:20.70,00:56:20.70,I respect and genuinely like a lot.
953,00:56:22.87,00:56:22.87,"Of course, the whole game's been"
954,00:56:24.07,00:56:24.07,"pretty difficult, so why should it change now?"
955,00:56:32.13,00:56:32.13,"- There's a lot of revenge involved in tonight for me,"
956,00:56:34.80,00:56:34.80,not so much revenge as just satisfaction because...
957,00:56:40.03,00:56:40.03,I don't really care for one of the people
958,00:56:41.47,00:56:41.47,that are up there tonight.
959,00:56:43.23,00:56:43.23,"And ultimately I'm going to get to vote against them, so I think"
960,00:56:45.87,00:56:45.87,that's pretty much the ultimate in satisfaction for not really
961,00:56:48.97,00:56:48.97,liking somebody.
962,00:56:50.47,00:56:50.47,But the fact that they made it 39 days with so many of us who
963,00:56:54.20,00:56:54.20,"have really big personalities, you have to give them credit."
964,00:56:58.43,00:56:58.43,"I mean, anybody who made it 39 days,"
965,00:57:00.10,00:57:00.10,you have to give them credit.
966,00:57:09.93,00:57:09.93,- There is loyalty in this game.
967,00:57:12.57,00:57:12.57,"It's that loyalty that will catapult you up, as seen with"
968,00:57:16.63,00:57:16.63,these two people that are in the final.
969,00:57:18.83,00:57:18.83,They had a loyalty to each other.
970,00:57:20.70,00:57:20.70,"But even in this game, everything gets cut loose at the"
971,00:57:23.83,00:57:23.83,end because there can only be one Survivor.
972,00:57:29.90,00:57:29.90,"- As far as making a decision on who to vote for,"
973,00:57:32.87,00:57:32.87,I made it in 2.9 seconds.
974,00:57:34.90,00:57:34.90,"As soon as I got voted off,"
975,00:57:36.50,00:57:36.50,"that night going out of Tribal Council, I said to myself,"
976,00:57:40.00,00:57:40.00,"""Self, I know who I want to vote for in the thing."""
977,00:57:44.30,00:57:44.30,"So my question tonight, it'll not be a serious question."
978,00:57:49.07,00:57:49.07,"They're going to scratch their head and say,"
979,00:57:50.70,00:57:50.70,"""What kind of stupid question did he ask?"""
980,00:57:52.87,00:57:52.87,"And that's... I want them just to laugh and think,"
981,00:57:56.90,00:57:56.90,"""How stupid has old Tom became?"""
982,00:58:03.50,00:58:03.50,- I don't know what approach I'm going to take tonight.
983,00:58:06.13,00:58:06.13,I would like to see them squirm.
984,00:58:08.03,00:58:08.03,"I'm the sorest loser out there,"
985,00:58:09.37,00:58:09.37,and I'll be the first one to admit it.
986,00:58:11.07,00:58:11.07,"So after the Kelly-voted-off debacle, which it was, because I"
987,00:58:15.20,00:58:15.20,"didn't vote for stupid Lex, but that's fine."
988,00:58:17.93,00:58:17.93,I can't wait.
989,00:58:19.83,00:58:19.83,I hope I get in there and they're
990,00:58:20.90,00:58:20.90,quaking in their little Reeboks.
991,00:58:24.03,00:58:24.03,"I just want to see fireworks, because I've been sitting there"
992,00:58:25.97,00:58:25.97,"for a really long time,"
993,00:58:27.23,00:58:27.23,and I just like to watch things happen.
994,00:58:29.90,00:58:29.90,I want to go now!
995,00:58:57.60,00:58:57.60,- (Probst) Ready to bring in the jury?
996,00:58:59.57,00:58:59.57,- I am.
997,00:59:19.13,00:59:19.13,"- Welcome, Ethan, Kim."
998,00:59:21.93,00:59:21.93,"Welcome, jury, to the final Tribal Council."
999,00:59:26.20,00:59:26.20,"Tonight, there are two significant differences"
1000,00:59:29.57,00:59:29.57,from any other Tribal Council.
1001,00:59:31.73,00:59:31.73,"The first one is, you two won't vote."
1002,00:59:34.10,00:59:34.10,"Tonight, only the jury votes."
1003,00:59:35.90,00:59:35.90,"And the other very big difference-- tonight, you want"
1004,00:59:38.80,00:59:38.80,to see your name on that piece of paper.
1005,00:59:40.73,00:59:40.73,The jury is no longer voting against somebody.
1006,00:59:43.77,00:59:43.77,"Tonight, the jury is voting for a winner."
1007,00:59:46.63,00:59:46.63,We're going to start by giving
1008,00:59:48.23,00:59:48.23,both of you a chance to address the jury.
1009,00:59:50.40,00:59:50.40,State your case.
1010,00:59:51.63,00:59:51.63,Why should the seven that you've
1011,00:59:53.30,00:59:53.30,already voted out turn around and vote for you?
1012,00:59:55.73,00:59:55.73,"Kim, let's start with you."
1013,01:00:01.77,01:00:01.77,"- I can't ask you guys, like, to vote for me."
1014,01:00:04.83,01:00:04.83,"I think that when you're out here with somebody for 39 days,"
1015,01:00:08.87,01:00:08.87,"24-7, I'm not sure I've ever experienced anything like that"
1016,01:00:12.10,01:00:12.10,"before in my life, not even with my family."
1017,01:00:15.00,01:00:15.00,So it would be very hard for me at this point to tell you
1018,01:00:19.33,01:00:19.33,something that you don't think I am already.
1019,01:00:22.03,01:00:22.03,"The only thing I can tell you is that, by being older than every"
1020,01:00:26.37,01:00:26.37,"single one of you, all of you made me feel young."
1021,01:00:29.77,01:00:29.77,"You all made me feel important, without exception, each one of"
1022,01:00:33.73,01:00:33.73,you has helped me be the best that I can be.
1023,01:00:37.43,01:00:37.43,"And so I'm leaving here, like, a winner big time."
1024,01:00:43.57,01:00:43.57,- Ethan.
1025,01:00:45.83,01:00:45.83,"- Well, when I first arrived here,"
1026,01:00:50.27,01:00:50.27,I set some goals for myself.
1027,01:00:52.73,01:00:52.73,"Obviously, to last as long as I can, but more importantly, to go"
1028,01:00:56.10,01:00:56.10,"home with my integrity and to kind of prove that good, honest"
1029,01:01:00.93,01:01:00.93,people can get far in the game.
1030,01:01:03.00,01:01:03.00,"The game consumes so much of everyone, and sometimes it"
1031,01:01:06.00,01:01:06.00,"clouds people's personality, it clouds the way you act."
1032,01:01:08.80,01:01:08.80,It clouds the way you treat other people.
1033,01:01:10.77,01:01:10.77,So it was important for me to achieve those goals.
1034,01:01:13.90,01:01:13.90,"And if you knew me from day one, if you knew me from the switch,"
1035,01:01:16.43,01:01:16.43,"if you knew me from the merge, it's important just to,"
1036,01:01:19.63,01:01:19.63,"you know, look at the whole picture"
1037,01:01:22.27,01:01:22.27,and you've got to vote what's in your heart.
1038,01:01:25.93,01:01:25.93,That's all I have to say.
1039,01:01:28.43,01:01:28.43,"- Okay, jury, I want you to take some time to think"
1040,01:01:33.00,01:01:33.00,"about what Ethan and Kim have just said, because, in a moment,"
1041,01:01:37.07,01:01:37.07,you're going to each ask them a question that will help you
1042,01:01:40.43,01:01:40.43,decide who will be the sole Survivor.
1043,01:01:51.13,01:01:51.13,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
1044,01:01:52.73,01:01:52.73,"- (Probst) Okay, jury, here's your chance"
1045,01:01:55.70,01:01:55.70,to address the final two.
1046,01:01:59.10,01:01:59.10,Here's how it's going to work.
1047,01:02:01.27,01:02:01.27,You guys can ask a question and/or make a statement.
1048,01:02:07.00,01:02:07.00,"When you're done, have a seat."
1049,01:02:10.77,01:02:10.77,We'll move on to the next jury member.
1050,01:02:13.13,01:02:13.13,"Brandon, get us going."
1051,01:02:20.30,01:02:20.30,- It's kind of funny tonight because I honestly do not know
1052,01:02:24.07,01:02:24.07,"whose name I'm going to write down, honestly don't."
1053,01:02:26.60,01:02:26.60,"I didn't know either one of you until the merge, and in the"
1054,01:02:29.97,01:02:29.97,"eight or seven or eight days we spent together, I'm not sure how"
1055,01:02:33.23,01:02:33.23,well I got to know either one of you.
1056,01:02:35.27,01:02:35.27,"So then I started thinking,"
1057,01:02:36.67,01:02:36.67,"""Who got to know me and liked me the best?"""
1058,01:02:40.53,01:02:40.53,And I realized neither one of you liked me enough to keep me
1059,01:02:44.53,01:02:44.53,"around three days longer than Frank,"
1060,01:02:46.53,01:02:46.53,so you couldn't like me that much.
1061,01:02:48.47,01:02:48.47,"So what I want to know is,"
1062,01:02:49.93,01:02:49.93,"if the two of you weren't sitting there,"
1063,01:02:51.87,01:02:51.87,"out of the seven of us, which person would you most like"
1064,01:02:56.20,01:02:56.20,"to see sitting there, and why?"
1065,01:02:58.40,01:02:58.40,- Ethan?
1066,01:03:00.47,01:03:00.47,- The person I would like to see sitting next to me
1067,01:03:02.23,01:03:02.23,the most would be Lex.
1068,01:03:05.83,01:03:05.83,"Lex was confident, he had extreme will, he won so many"
1069,01:03:12.13,01:03:12.13,"challenges, and if I could beat Lex at one of the hardest"
1070,01:03:16.23,01:03:16.23,"games around, it would be one of the greatest accomplishments"
1071,01:03:20.53,01:03:20.53,that I could accomplish.
1072,01:03:22.27,01:03:22.27,- (Probst) Kim.
1073,01:03:24.27,01:03:24.27,- I would definitely agree that...
1074,01:03:26.53,01:03:26.53,"I mean, I'd have to go with Lex."
1075,01:03:27.70,01:03:27.70,He was as supportive of me as anybody here.
1076,01:03:30.97,01:03:30.97,"I mean, even at one point I said, ""You know,"
1077,01:03:33.53,01:03:33.53,"""I can't believe I messed up this challenge."
1078,01:03:36.03,01:03:36.03,"You know, I don't have any excuses."""
1079,01:03:37.73,01:03:37.73,"And he said, like, ""Yes, you do you have 56 excuses."""
1080,01:03:40.13,01:03:40.13,"And I thought that was very thoughtful, you know, that he"
1081,01:03:43.30,01:03:43.30,"would, he would, you know, say that,"
1082,01:03:44.97,01:03:44.97,and he meant it with all sincerity.
1083,01:03:48.47,01:03:48.47,- The second part of my question was I wanted to know
1084,01:03:50.83,01:03:50.83,who you thought deserved to sit up there the least out of
1085,01:03:53.03,01:03:53.03,"the seven of us, just tell me the name,"
1086,01:03:55.17,01:03:55.17,you don't even have to say why.
1087,01:03:57.53,01:03:57.53,- Um... you.
1088,01:04:01.63,01:04:01.63,- That's tough.
1089,01:04:03.67,01:04:03.67,I guess...
1090,01:04:07.07,01:04:07.07,"I guess Tommy, and it's only because I felt that he was,"
1091,01:04:11.77,01:04:11.77,"at the end, maybe not so in favor of women."
1092,01:04:15.57,01:04:15.57,But that's just a feeling that I had at the end.
1093,01:04:18.17,01:04:18.17,"I think... I mean, I think he's cool because he's a guy's guy,"
1094,01:04:20.37,01:04:20.37,but that's maybe...
1095,01:04:21.77,01:04:21.77,"if I have to pick a reason, that would be the reason."
1096,01:04:24.83,01:04:24.83,"Sorry, Tom."
1097,01:04:26.90,01:04:26.90,- That's all right.
1098,01:04:28.10,01:04:28.10,- (Probst) Lex.
1099,01:04:33.70,01:04:33.70,"- Once you get back home, what is the first selfless act"
1100,01:04:36.80,01:04:36.80,that you are going to perform?
1101,01:04:38.93,01:04:38.93,"The first unselfish, selfless act..."
1102,01:04:41.97,01:04:41.97,- The first act of charity that I'm absolutely going to do is to
1103,01:04:44.50,01:04:44.50,"look into this project that we all want to do as Survivors,"
1104,01:04:46.90,01:04:46.90,the Wamba project.
1105,01:04:49.20,01:04:49.20,"When I heard that 33 million people have AIDS, but 22 million"
1106,01:04:53.30,01:04:53.30,"of those, two-thirds, are here in Africa where we are,"
1107,01:04:56.57,01:04:56.57,it's something that I feel really strongly about doing.
1108,01:05:01.27,01:05:01.27,- Ethan.
1109,01:05:02.80,01:05:02.80,"- When me and you went on our trip to Wamba, that very last"
1110,01:05:05.23,01:05:05.23,second where I was playing hacky sack with all of those little
1111,01:05:08.60,01:05:08.60,"kids, that kind of touched me and my selfless act would be to"
1112,01:05:12.80,01:05:12.80,"give my time to some sort of inner-city, you know, soccer"
1113,01:05:16.67,01:05:16.67,"league where I can look at these kids, these diamonds in the"
1114,01:05:20.30,01:05:20.30,"rough and, you know, get them to start a league because the"
1115,01:05:22.97,01:05:22.97,"smiles on those kids' faces when I started playing soccer,"
1116,01:05:25.57,01:05:25.57,"you know, that inspired me a little bit."
1117,01:05:27.50,01:05:27.50,"- Okay, thanks."
1118,01:05:31.87,01:05:31.87,- (Probst) Frank.
1119,01:05:36.87,01:05:36.87,"- Good evening, Kim, Ethan."
1120,01:05:38.60,01:05:38.60,Congratulations so far on your achievements.
1121,01:05:41.33,01:05:41.33,"When we set foot on this continent, the first thing"
1122,01:05:43.53,01:05:43.53,we were educated and warned about was Africa's big five--
1123,01:05:47.13,01:05:47.13,"the rhino, the cape buffalo, the elephant,"
1124,01:05:49.47,01:05:49.47,the lion and the leopard.
1125,01:05:51.27,01:05:51.27,If 16 new contestants were placed before you and you had to
1126,01:05:56.23,01:05:56.23,"personally advise them on how to outwit, outplay and outlast,"
1127,01:05:59.93,01:05:59.93,I want you to name me the big five characteristics that those
1128,01:06:03.73,01:06:03.73,individuals would have to possess
1129,01:06:05.40,01:06:05.40,to be the ultimate Survivor.
1130,01:06:07.03,01:06:07.03,- (Probst) Ethan.
1131,01:06:09.20,01:06:09.20,"- I would think you need willpower, you need strength,"
1132,01:06:13.23,01:06:13.23,"you need integrity, you need, um..."
1133,01:06:21.50,01:06:21.50,intelligence...
1134,01:06:26.00,01:06:26.00,and... and a little bit of luck.
1135,01:06:31.20,01:06:31.20,- (Probst) Kim.
1136,01:06:32.63,01:06:32.63,"- I think you need respect,"
1137,01:06:36.40,01:06:36.40,"thoughtfulness, flexibility,"
1138,01:06:39.73,01:06:39.73,love and...
1139,01:06:45.10,01:06:45.10,understanding.
1140,01:06:46.93,01:06:46.93,- Thank you.
1141,01:06:51.97,01:06:51.97,- Kelly.
1142,01:06:56.17,01:06:56.17,"- Hi, guys. I want to say hi."
1143,01:06:57.67,01:06:57.67,I haven't talked to you in a while.
1144,01:06:59.57,01:06:59.57,I've had 15 days to sit here and think about who was going to be
1145,01:07:03.07,01:07:03.07,across from me on this big night.
1146,01:07:05.50,01:07:05.50,"And to be totally honest, I had hoped to see you guys on this"
1147,01:07:08.03,01:07:08.03,"side of things, with me."
1148,01:07:10.50,01:07:10.50,But it could have been worse.
1149,01:07:12.97,01:07:12.97,"Kim, I was surprised and disappointed"
1150,01:07:19.13,01:07:19.13,"by your conduct my last few days at camp,"
1151,01:07:23.30,01:07:23.30,"but you did do some great things, too."
1152,01:07:27.40,01:07:27.40,"You gave me something that I've been wanting for a while now,"
1153,01:07:32.20,01:07:32.20,and that was giving Lex the chance to do his own walk of
1154,01:07:35.50,01:07:35.50,"shame, so thank you for that."
1155,01:07:38.33,01:07:38.33,"Though you totally sold me out,"
1156,01:07:41.40,01:07:41.40,I admire you for everything you've done.
1157,01:07:44.83,01:07:44.83,But I hope you know that part of
1158,01:07:47.70,01:07:47.70,your success tonight comes at my expense.
1159,01:07:51.30,01:07:51.30,"If you think you did this with high integrity,"
1160,01:07:54.30,01:07:54.30,don't flatter yourself.
1161,01:07:55.77,01:07:55.77,"On the other hand, we have Ethan."
1162,01:07:58.53,01:07:58.53,"You know, I've had to sit there for a long time, and I've"
1163,01:08:02.30,01:08:02.30,listened to what Jeff said and this game's about relationships.
1164,01:08:04.83,01:08:04.83,And I certainly didn't see you try to make one with me.
1165,01:08:07.67,01:08:07.67,I don't know about everybody else.
1166,01:08:09.57,01:08:09.57,"Hence, my dilemma."
1167,01:08:12.30,01:08:12.30,"I've thought a lot about it, I'm going to need a little help."
1168,01:08:15.73,01:08:15.73,"You guys have got to pick a number between one and 1,000."
1169,01:08:19.33,01:08:19.33,- (Probst) Kim.
1170,01:08:20.93,01:08:20.93,- Three.
1171,01:08:25.47,01:08:25.47,- (Probst) Ethan.
1172,01:08:27.60,01:08:27.60,- Uh... 888.
1173,01:08:31.67,01:08:31.67,- Thank you. I'm very proud of you both.
1174,01:08:37.60,01:08:37.60,- Kim Powers.
1175,01:08:46.80,01:08:46.80,- Hi.
1176,01:08:49.93,01:08:49.93,"Um... when I played the game, I learned something about myself"
1177,01:08:55.73,01:08:55.73,from people like Tom and Frank that I would never ever have the
1178,01:08:58.97,01:08:58.97,opportunity to learn from.
1179,01:09:00.43,01:09:00.43,And it was more about myself than it was about them.
1180,01:09:03.20,01:09:03.20,It was things that they showed me.
1181,01:09:05.23,01:09:05.23,"So, my question to you guys is,"
1182,01:09:06.90,01:09:06.90,who on the jury did you learn the most about yourself from?
1183,01:09:12.07,01:09:12.07,And who on the jury did you
1184,01:09:14.63,01:09:14.63,"learn the least about yourself, and why?"
1185,01:09:18.27,01:09:18.27,- Kim.
1186,01:09:20.27,01:09:20.27,"- Strangely enough, I think I learned"
1187,01:09:22.63,01:09:22.63,the most about myself from you.
1188,01:09:24.37,01:09:24.37,"I mean, you know, it wasn't that you were with the tribe with"
1189,01:09:26.93,01:09:26.93,"me for so long, it wasn't that you were particularly supportive"
1190,01:09:29.10,01:09:29.10,"of me, but you had the guts to call off a wedding"
1191,01:09:35.00,01:09:35.00,that I don't know that I could have done.
1192,01:09:37.77,01:09:37.77,"I think that, in all my years,"
1193,01:09:39.87,01:09:39.87,I would just maybe keep doing what was expected of me.
1194,01:09:43.27,01:09:43.27,"And for you to have learned that at such a young age,"
1195,01:09:46.10,01:09:46.10,I wasn't too old to learn it.
1196,01:09:47.57,01:09:47.57,And then the next thing was when you sort of got dealt a blow by
1197,01:09:51.90,01:09:51.90,one of your tribe members and when you took your...
1198,01:09:55.23,01:09:55.23,"whatever amount of time to get over it,"
1199,01:09:57.90,01:09:57.90,"your immediate reaction after that was, was that it was very,"
1200,01:10:00.03,01:10:00.03,very important to you to want to get back
1201,01:10:02.17,01:10:02.17,and be friends with that person.
1202,01:10:04.07,01:10:04.07,"So you may not forget, but you were a forgiver,"
1203,01:10:06.80,01:10:06.80,and I think that that's huge.
1204,01:10:09.77,01:10:09.77,"So, I mean, I learned an amazing amount from you."
1205,01:10:13.13,01:10:13.13,"The second half of the question,"
1206,01:10:17.83,01:10:17.83,"Tom, I'm not picking on you, buddy,"
1207,01:10:19.63,01:10:19.63,"but I had a lot of laughs with you, and I like that."
1208,01:10:23.87,01:10:23.87,But it wasn't that I learned a whole lot.
1209,01:10:27.63,01:10:27.63,"I mean, I had a great time, but I didn't learn a lot."
1210,01:10:31.33,01:10:31.33,- Ethan.
1211,01:10:32.73,01:10:32.73,- I think I learned the most about myself from Teresa.
1212,01:10:36.77,01:10:36.77,I felt a bond with Teresa because she was almost like my
1213,01:10:40.50,01:10:40.50,"safe place in this game,"
1214,01:10:44.03,01:10:44.03,"and I felt extremely comfortable with her,"
1215,01:10:46.83,01:10:46.83,"and her willpower and her desire to win, her desire"
1216,01:10:50.50,01:10:50.50,to be here was just such an inspiration to me and something
1217,01:10:54.23,01:10:54.23,I strive to be like and something
1218,01:10:56.20,01:10:56.20,I'll carry away from this forever.
1219,01:10:58.50,01:10:58.50,Forever.
1220,01:11:01.20,01:11:01.20,And the person I learned the least about from
1221,01:11:05.57,01:11:05.57,would be probably Kelly.
1222,01:11:09.77,01:11:09.77,It seems that I didn't take enough time to get to know Kelly
1223,01:11:15.37,01:11:15.37,and I'm sure she's a great girl.
1224,01:11:18.87,01:11:18.87,"And I'm sure I could learn a lot of things from her,"
1225,01:11:21.53,01:11:21.53,but it was a mistake that I didn't spend as
1226,01:11:24.60,01:11:24.60,much time with her as I could have.
1227,01:11:27.93,01:11:27.93,"- Big Tom, you're next."
1228,01:11:33.73,01:11:33.73,"- First of all, I want to congratulate both of you"
1229,01:11:35.93,01:11:35.93,"for making it this far,"
1230,01:11:38.37,01:11:38.37,and just getting there because it's a great accomplishment.
1231,01:11:44.73,01:11:44.73,"So I've got to ask a question, and I will."
1232,01:11:47.77,01:11:47.77,"In camp I lost a little bit of weight,"
1233,01:11:50.37,01:11:50.37,and it was because of the mush.
1234,01:11:53.03,01:11:53.03,"Ethan, if a hyena came through camp and ate our mush and then"
1235,01:11:58.03,01:11:58.03,"after he ate it, he turned around and licked his hiney,"
1236,01:12:01.30,01:12:01.30,did he do it because that was animal instinct
1237,01:12:04.30,01:12:04.30,or because to get the taste of the mush out of his mouth?
1238,01:12:08.27,01:12:08.27,What do you think?
1239,01:12:14.13,01:12:14.13,"- Well, if I know..."
1240,01:12:16.00,01:12:16.00,"if I was a hyena and I had eaten that mush,"
1241,01:12:20.43,01:12:20.43,it would probably be...
1242,01:12:25.73,01:12:25.73,to clean his hind end because I didn't mind
1243,01:12:27.10,01:12:27.10,the taste of that mush as much as you did.
1244,01:12:28.67,01:12:28.67,- Okay.
1245,01:12:30.07,01:12:30.07,"Kim, you cooked that mush, so it might be a double standard"
1246,01:12:34.07,01:12:34.07,"for you, but do you understand..."
1247,01:12:36.97,01:12:36.97,"I mean, did you hear the question?"
1248,01:12:40.10,01:12:40.10,- I did hear it.
1249,01:12:41.10,01:12:41.10,"- Okay, what's your rebuttal?"
1250,01:12:42.67,01:12:42.67,- I'm answering the same question?
1251,01:12:44.23,01:12:44.23,"- Yes, ma'am."
1252,01:12:45.67,01:12:45.67,"- I would have to say that the hyena, you know, was just"
1253,01:12:50.87,01:12:50.87,cleaning his hind end.
1254,01:12:52.93,01:12:52.93,"I mean, the mush was the only thing he had to eat, and I would"
1255,01:12:56.10,01:12:56.10,"think that maybe, you know, he needed it to survive and when"
1256,01:12:59.13,01:12:59.13,"you get hungry enough, you eat what you have to eat, and taste"
1257,01:13:02.30,01:13:02.30,is one of the first luxuries that goes out the window.
1258,01:13:04.67,01:13:04.67,"- Thank you all and congratulations, again,"
1259,01:13:07.30,01:13:07.30,to both of you.
1260,01:13:14.47,01:13:14.47,- Teresa.
1261,01:13:20.47,01:13:20.47,"- Well, that's a tough act to follow."
1262,01:13:23.77,01:13:23.77,"What I'd like to ask you is,"
1263,01:13:29.00,01:13:29.00,"even trying to play with integrity, I know there are"
1264,01:13:31.53,01:13:31.53,times when you have to say something about somebody that
1265,01:13:35.57,01:13:35.57,you wish you could take back.
1266,01:13:37.83,01:13:37.83,"So, if you could take back anything you said about any of"
1267,01:13:42.63,01:13:42.63,"the jurors, what would it be?"
1268,01:13:45.50,01:13:45.50,And who was it said about?
1269,01:13:51.43,01:13:51.43,"- I'm not so sure it was something that I said,"
1270,01:13:54.93,01:13:54.93,but it was something that I did.
1271,01:13:58.93,01:13:58.93,"I didn't sell Kelly out,"
1272,01:14:00.73,01:14:00.73,but I didn't know enough to go to her defense.
1273,01:14:06.33,01:14:06.33,There was a vote that was cast that I really didn't think that
1274,01:14:08.83,01:14:08.83,"was a vote of hers, but I misjudged that it was somebody"
1275,01:14:13.07,01:14:13.07,"else, and it was somebody else."
1276,01:14:15.37,01:14:15.37,"But it all occurred so fast, that-- and I'm not making"
1277,01:14:19.67,01:14:19.67,excuses because there is no excuse for it--
1278,01:14:22.13,01:14:22.13,"I was wrong not to at least look into it better, but that's the"
1279,01:14:25.33,01:14:25.33,one thing I regret of all of this more than anything
1280,01:14:27.70,01:14:27.70,that I've done here.
1281,01:14:29.97,01:14:29.97,"- On a similar line, when that same vote was cast, this mystery"
1282,01:14:34.73,01:14:34.73,"vote that everyone was talking about,"
1283,01:14:36.20,01:14:36.20,I had thought that vote came from Frank.
1284,01:14:40.17,01:14:40.17,"And I sat on it for a while, and I definitely mentioned my"
1285,01:14:46.23,01:14:46.23,"concerns that it was from Frank,"
1286,01:14:47.97,01:14:47.97,and that we've got to take care of this right away.
1287,01:14:50.80,01:14:50.80,"And luckily, I didn't because it turns out that it wasn't Frank,"
1288,01:14:56.00,01:14:56.00,and I would have made the wrong decision.
1289,01:14:58.10,01:14:58.10,"But I feel bad about, you know, accusing someone so quickly"
1290,01:15:01.53,01:15:01.53,"without, you know, going in and finding"
1291,01:15:03.87,01:15:03.87,more detail about things.
1292,01:15:08.10,01:15:08.10,- I congratulate you both.
1293,01:15:09.60,01:15:09.60,"I think you both deserve to be there, and I'm crazy about both"
1294,01:15:12.00,01:15:12.00,"of you, so good luck."
1295,01:15:16.00,01:15:16.00,"- (Probst) Okay, jury."
1296,01:15:17.93,01:15:17.93,You have a big decision to make.
1297,01:15:19.67,01:15:19.67,You're about to reward somebody with a million dollars
1298,01:15:25.10,01:15:25.10,and the title of Survivor.
1299,01:15:28.47,01:15:28.47,I'll give you a minute to think about that decision.
1300,01:15:41.30,01:15:41.30,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
1301,01:15:46.97,01:15:46.97,"- (Probst) Okay, jury, it's time for the final vote."
1302,01:15:49.67,01:15:49.67,"I just want to remind you, tonight you are not voting"
1303,01:15:52.20,01:15:52.20,"against somebody, you are voting for somebody."
1304,01:15:55.40,01:15:55.40,The person you feel most deserving of the title
1305,01:15:58.97,01:15:58.97,"and the money, or perhaps in the case of"
1306,01:16:01.50,01:16:01.50,"a couple of you, the lesser of two evils."
1307,01:16:04.10,01:16:04.10,"Either way, you are voting for a winner."
1308,01:16:07.10,01:16:07.10,"Brandon, you're up first."
1309,01:16:33.13,01:16:33.13,"- This is a pretty funny game because I came here,"
1310,01:16:37.00,01:16:37.00,I knew my question was totally just a way
1311,01:16:39.23,01:16:39.23,for me to get one last jab at Frank.
1312,01:16:41.13,01:16:41.13,I totally was going to vote for Ethan
1313,01:16:43.57,01:16:43.57,without even thinking about it.
1314,01:16:45.17,01:16:45.17,But you know what?
1315,01:16:46.53,01:16:46.53,"Ethan was so stupid, he slammed me on my own question."
1316,01:16:50.60,01:16:50.60,So you don't slam somebody on their own question and say you
1317,01:16:53.73,01:16:53.73,would be the least likely to pick that person and then expect
1318,01:16:56.93,01:16:56.93,them to vote for you.
1319,01:16:58.40,01:16:58.40,"So, Kim's just as deserving as Ethan, and it's kind of cool"
1320,01:17:02.17,01:17:02.17,that a 56-year-old woman did really well.
1321,01:17:04.73,01:17:04.73,So... and she didn't slam me on my own question.
1322,01:17:07.77,01:17:07.77,"Dumb, Ethan, so stupid."
1323,01:17:52.60,01:17:52.60,"- This was just an unbelievably hard decision for me to make,"
1324,01:17:56.13,01:17:56.13,and I have to say that I came in here tonight thinking that
1325,01:18:00.87,01:18:00.87,I would be voting for Ethan.
1326,01:18:02.90,01:18:02.90,I think I realized that both you and Ethan were absolutely
1327,01:18:07.53,01:18:07.53,amazing competitors in very different ways.
1328,01:18:10.33,01:18:10.33,And I was extremely impressed with both of you.
1329,01:18:12.73,01:18:12.73,And it was a very hard decision for me.
1330,01:18:14.80,01:18:14.80,"Kim, you impressed me so much."
1331,01:18:17.27,01:18:17.27,"You're 56 years old and you are a really strong woman, and for"
1332,01:18:21.73,01:18:21.73,"whatever reason, I just... I think you deserve to win."
1333,01:18:53.53,01:18:53.53,"- Just like a woman in my home town, stuck a knife in my back."
1334,01:18:58.40,01:18:58.40,"Everything that goes around comes around, and, Kim, you lost"
1335,01:19:02.17,01:19:02.17,"two or three challenges, and I felt sorry for you."
1336,01:19:05.30,01:19:05.30,"But then I decided we'd keep the weakest woman, and you was"
1337,01:19:09.70,01:19:09.70,"the weakest one and you rode me,"
1338,01:19:11.73,01:19:11.73,Ethan and Lex's coattail to get where you are.
1339,01:19:15.37,01:19:15.37,But you're not Dorothy and you can't click them shoes and do
1340,01:19:19.97,01:19:19.97,"something miraculous this time,"
1341,01:19:21.87,01:19:21.87,because your failure's caught up with you.
1342,01:19:24.43,01:19:24.43,"And no, I'm not whispering like you tell me every morning."
1343,01:19:27.87,01:19:27.87,"Tonight it's my turn to tell you, shh, I'm hushing you."
1344,01:19:31.07,01:19:31.07,"Shut up, you're done."
1345,01:19:33.40,01:19:33.40,"Ethan, the best man, has won."
1346,01:19:35.30,01:19:35.30,"The weak one, you have not."
1347,01:19:39.53,01:19:39.53,I don't care if they did hear it.
1348,01:19:53.03,01:19:53.03,- Well-deserved.
1349,01:20:06.40,01:20:06.40,"- Benjamin, isn't there something you wanted to tell me?"
1350,01:20:09.43,01:20:09.43,"Oh, yes, Mrs. Robinson,"
1351,01:20:10.77,01:20:10.77,thank you very much for the opportunity.
1352,01:20:12.53,01:20:12.53,"No, no, Benjamin."
1353,01:20:13.90,01:20:13.90,The room number.
1354,01:20:15.23,01:20:15.23,568.
1355,01:20:17.87,01:20:17.87, The Graduate was my favorite movie.
1356,01:20:19.80,01:20:19.80,Congratulations.
1357,01:20:29.20,01:20:29.20,"- For the last time in Africa, I'll go tally the votes."
1358,01:20:42.33,01:20:42.33,(no voices)
1359,01:21:05.87,01:21:05.87,\xe2\x99\xaa\xe2\x99\xaa
1360,01:21:32.10,01:21:32.10,"- Ethan, Kim."
1361,01:21:34.00,01:21:34.00,"Jury, 39 days is a long time."
1362,01:21:38.53,01:21:38.53,"39 days out here, in Africa,"
1363,01:21:42.67,01:21:42.67,"in what has been, without question,"
1364,01:21:44.43,01:21:44.43,the most physically demanding and mentally challenging
1365,01:21:47.70,01:21:47.70,environment Survivor  has ever taken place in.
1366,01:21:50.23,01:21:50.23,Life-changing.
1367,01:21:51.70,01:21:51.70,"But, as Lex said, you don't get to this spot by accident"
1368,01:21:57.43,01:21:57.43,or by coincidence.
1369,01:21:58.87,01:21:58.87,You get here because you earned it.
1370,01:22:00.53,01:22:00.53,"No matter how you break it down, no matter how you justify it or"
1371,01:22:02.77,01:22:02.77,"apologize for it, you're here, they're not."
1372,01:22:06.40,01:22:06.40,"So, now that the votes have been cast,"
1373,01:22:09.20,01:22:09.20,nothing you can do to help yourself or hurt yourself.
1374,01:22:12.13,01:22:12.13,"Kim, before I read these, anything that you want to maybe"
1375,01:22:17.67,01:22:17.67,admit to that you wouldn't want to have admitted to during
1376,01:22:20.43,01:22:20.43,"the game, because it might have affected the vote,"
1377,01:22:22.80,01:22:22.80,"but now that everything's done, you're willing to give up?"
1378,01:22:26.83,01:22:26.83,"- Um... I guess if the truth must be known, I was probably"
1379,01:22:31.63,01:22:31.63,really scared out there a lot of the time.
1380,01:22:34.57,01:22:34.57,I may not have covered it as well as I thought.
1381,01:22:39.43,01:22:39.43,"And I think I was, I was scared of failing, scared of letting"
1382,01:22:45.60,01:22:45.60,"myself down, scared of letting you think that maybe I didn't"
1383,01:22:49.40,01:22:49.40,deserve to be there.
1384,01:22:50.87,01:22:50.87,"And then at some point, that kind of all changed for me."
1385,01:22:54.93,01:22:54.93,- (Probst) When?
1386,01:22:56.27,01:22:56.27,Do you recall--
1387,01:22:57.57,01:22:57.57,was there a moment when you got power or what?
1388,01:22:59.30,01:22:59.30,"- Yeah, I'm not so sure I got power,"
1389,01:23:01.63,01:23:01.63,"but in that last immunity, I felt"
1390,01:23:06.10,01:23:06.10,"like I needed to prove that I deserved to be there, that I"
1391,01:23:11.70,01:23:11.70,"could do it on my own, that none of you guys needed to carry me"
1392,01:23:15.80,01:23:15.80,"or it was because of my great cooking, you know, or whatever"
1393,01:23:19.67,01:23:19.67,that I was still there.
1394,01:23:21.20,01:23:21.20,"And somehow I just held on,"
1395,01:23:24.93,01:23:24.93,"and I felt that I needed to do that, just to prove it."
1396,01:23:30.57,01:23:30.57,"- (Probst) Were you proving it to them,"
1397,01:23:31.67,01:23:31.67,or were you proving it to yourself?
1398,01:23:33.77,01:23:33.77,"- Um... I guess I'd like to think I was proving it to them,"
1399,01:23:39.27,01:23:39.27,but I think for me and what I'll take away for the rest of
1400,01:23:42.87,01:23:42.87,my life is that I did prove it to me.
1401,01:23:46.10,01:23:46.10,"- (Probst) Ethan, after enduring a certainly tough final"
1402,01:23:50.37,01:23:50.37,Tribal Council where you were evaluated
1403,01:23:52.53,01:23:52.53,"and maybe even felt attacked at certain times, anything about"
1404,01:23:56.33,01:23:56.33,"what went on, whether it be a question or a comment or"
1405,01:24:00.07,01:24:00.07,anything that surprised you tonight?
1406,01:24:01.97,01:24:01.97,- Yeah.
1407,01:24:03.30,01:24:03.30,"I was surprised with Kelly, for someone so smart,"
1408,01:24:07.83,01:24:07.83,"so knowledgeable about the game, I was surprised that it came"
1409,01:24:11.13,01:24:11.13,down to the fact that she used a number to determine
1410,01:24:14.03,01:24:14.03,who was going to win.
1411,01:24:16.20,01:24:16.20,That surprised me a little bit.
1412,01:24:18.53,01:24:18.53,- (Probst) Frustrate you after spending 39 days in a hut made
1413,01:24:21.60,01:24:21.60,of elephant dung?
1414,01:24:22.63,01:24:22.63,"- Yeah, we all worked hard,"
1415,01:24:24.07,01:24:24.07,everyone worked hard to get where we are.
1416,01:24:26.13,01:24:26.13,And it's a little bit silly to come down to something
1417,01:24:29.03,01:24:29.03,as simple as that.
1418,01:24:31.43,01:24:31.43,"- (Probst) Silly, but is it fair?"
1419,01:24:32.93,01:24:32.93,If that's the deciding vote and it comes down to you picking
1420,01:24:35.00,01:24:35.00,"a number between one and a thousand,"
1421,01:24:36.47,01:24:36.47,are you going to be okay with that?
1422,01:24:38.23,01:24:38.23,"- I guess I have to be, don't I?"
1423,01:24:40.93,01:24:40.93,"- (Probst) Yeah, I guess you do."
1424,01:24:43.50,01:24:43.50,"All right, let's get to the vote."
1425,01:24:46.00,01:24:46.00,"Here's what's at stake-- for the winner, Chevy Avalanche truck,"
1426,01:24:50.73,01:24:50.73,"same truck, in fact, that Lex used"
1427,01:24:53.00,01:24:53.00,to deliver the HIV test kits out to Wamba hospital.
1428,01:24:56.60,01:24:56.60,"The title of ""Survivor,"" bragging rights, which when"
1429,01:25:02.27,01:25:02.27,"you're a Type A like the 16 of you guys,"
1430,01:25:04.60,01:25:04.60,that's worth something.
1431,01:25:06.70,01:25:06.70,"Finally, a million bucks, which is $900,000 more"
1432,01:25:11.40,01:25:11.40,than the runner-up gets.
1433,01:25:13.40,01:25:13.40,"So, keep in mind, as I read these votes, if your name is"
1434,01:25:17.07,01:25:17.07,"on the ballot, that is a good thing."
1435,01:25:19.07,01:25:19.07,That is a vote for you to win.
1436,01:25:21.13,01:25:21.13,"There are seven votes, it takes four to win."
1437,01:25:25.57,01:25:25.57,I'll read the votes.
1438,01:25:31.87,01:25:31.87,"First vote, Kim."
1439,01:25:41.00,01:25:41.00,Ethan.
1440,01:25:43.37,01:25:43.37,One vote each.
1441,01:25:50.47,01:25:50.47,Kim.
1442,01:25:57.87,01:25:57.87,Ethan.
1443,01:25:58.90,01:25:58.90,"Two votes Ethan, two votes Kim."
1444,01:26:06.80,01:26:06.80,Three votes Ethan.
1445,01:26:08.50,01:26:08.50,"Ethan, you need just one more."
1446,01:26:14.50,01:26:14.50,The winner of Survivor:  Africa.
1447,01:26:17.00,01:26:17.00,- Woo!
1448,01:26:18.03,01:26:18.03,(cheering and applause)
