94,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,"T-Bird said to me before TribalCouncil, all of a sudden some of"

98,00:05:21.17,00:05:21.17,because Tom said Icouldn't be trusted.

102,00:05:33.43,00:05:33.43,one that voted that secondvote for Lex.
103,00:05:36.53,00:05:36.53,That upset Lexso much in the beginning.
104,00:05:39.40,00:05:39.40,And Teresa also said Tommy hadbeen lobbying to get Lex voted
105,00:05:42.47,00:05:42.47,"off, and that was veryupsetting to Lex."

107,00:05:49.77,00:05:49.77,because he felt thatLex hung him out to dry.

109,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,"- I would be skeptical, too,but two different occasions,"

111,00:06:01.37,00:06:01.37,"- Mama Cat had been approacheda couple times by Tom, who had"

113,00:06:07.30,00:06:07.30,"these Tribal Councils, that'stotally okay by me."""
114,00:06:16.60,00:06:16.60,"- (whispering)In his mind, he can't write"
115,00:06:18.30,00:06:18.30,"the vote down, but if someoneelse does, that's okay."
116,00:06:22.23,00:06:22.23,"I mean, I won't know tomorrowbecause I'm going to take Tom"
117,00:06:25.93,00:06:25.93,"and he and I are going to have aman-to-man talk, just the two of"
118,00:06:28.20,00:06:28.20,"us, and I am going to make himshake on it, on his son's name,"
119,00:06:31.87,00:06:31.87,"and if he won't do that, then Iknow what the truth is."

128,00:07:19.87,00:07:19.87,"that we've been out here,and that's a long time."
129,00:07:26.50,00:07:26.50,- Day 37.
130,00:07:27.60,00:07:27.60,"- Amazing, huh?"
131,00:07:28.87,00:07:28.87,- I can't believe it.
132,00:07:31.43,00:07:31.43,- The four of us left are allprobably more surprised than
133,00:07:33.43,00:07:33.43,the next about the fact thatwe're still here.
134,00:07:36.13,00:07:36.13,And I couldn't have imaginedit being as crazy as it is.
135,00:07:38.80,00:07:38.80,"It's good, it's bad,it's bitter, it's sweet."

137,00:07:43.80,00:07:43.80,"- But more now than ever, ourbrains are focused on, well,"

139,00:07:59.30,00:07:59.30,I felt that there's a reallygood chance that Tom had pulled
140,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97,"a bit of treachery when it cameto him and me, and what I need"
141,00:08:05.73,00:08:05.73,"to do is confront Tom with itand just find out was it true,"
142,00:08:08.70,00:08:08.70,was he goingto 'fess up to it?
143,00:08:10.83,00:08:10.83,"Tom, I want to talk."
144,00:08:12.20,00:08:12.20,"- Okay, brother."
145,00:08:13.67,00:08:13.67,"- I heard some stuff yesterdaythat made me really unhappy,"
146,00:08:16.40,00:08:16.40,and I need totalk to you about it.
147,00:08:17.43,00:08:17.43,- Okay.
148,00:08:18.60,00:08:18.60,- Because I believein having everything
149,00:08:19.63,00:08:19.63,right out in the open.
150,00:08:20.70,00:08:20.70,"- Okay, you put itout here."
151,00:08:22.27,00:08:22.27,"- When we came back fromSamburu, did you tell T-Bird"
152,00:08:25.97,00:08:25.97,"that she couldn't trust me,that I was not to be trusted?"
153,00:08:29.37,00:08:29.37,- Absolutely not.
154,00:08:31.83,00:08:31.83,"No question, no ifs,no ands, no ands about it."
155,00:08:36.87,00:08:36.87,What kind of question is that toask this far down in the game?
156,00:08:40.33,00:08:40.33,"Hell, far as I know, I don'tthink I did, but if I did,"
157,00:08:43.47,00:08:43.47,Lex has beenthe man to watch.
158,00:08:45.63,00:08:45.63,"Hell, he's been winningimmunities and everything else,"
159,00:08:49.43,00:08:49.43,and that's the reason he'sgetting all the votes.
160,00:08:51.07,00:08:51.07,If you're going to runin the front of the pack
161,00:08:52.90,00:08:52.90,"with a white horse, you're goingto be shot at."
162,00:08:55.97,00:08:55.97,"- Also, did you ever tell Kimthat she should vote for me,"
163,00:08:58.13,00:08:58.13,"that you would never vote for mebecause we made a pact,"
164,00:09:00.10,00:09:00.10,but sheshould vote for me?
165,00:09:01.80,00:09:01.80,"- Right, I told her,yeah, yeah."
166,00:09:03.67,00:09:03.67,- Why did you do that?
167,00:09:05.13,00:09:05.13,"- Because in the game, if shewanted to... the other players,"
168,00:09:08.40,00:09:08.40,I had no control...
169,00:09:09.87,00:09:09.87,- Why would you tell her tovote for me when we made a pact?
170,00:09:12.43,00:09:12.43,- Why dig up bones?
171,00:09:13.80,00:09:13.80,- Not digging up bones.
172,00:09:14.93,00:09:14.93,This is--these are current events.
173,00:09:17.07,00:09:17.07,"- That's kind of like overthere at Samburu, you were"
174,00:09:19.37,00:09:19.37,"the first one that said,""Well, don't vote for me."""
175,00:09:21.60,00:09:21.60,"- No, I didn't say that,Tom, at all."
176,00:09:23.77,00:09:23.77,I thought it was only fair andright for me to say that none of
177,00:09:26.00,00:09:26.00,"us had votes against us, and Italked to you about it"
178,00:09:28.23,00:09:28.23,"before I talkedto Brandon about it,"
179,00:09:29.90,00:09:29.90,and you said that wasthe fair thing to do.
180,00:09:32.23,00:09:32.23,- I felt like you saved yourass over there.
181,00:09:34.63,00:09:34.63,"- No, that's not true,you know what, well,"
182,00:09:36.27,00:09:36.27,"I'll tell you right now,you're wrong."
183,00:09:38.80,00:09:38.80,"Tom and I, there have been acouple of situations in the past"
184,00:09:40.90,00:09:40.90,that have arisen that we haven'tquite seen eye-to-eye on.
185,00:09:44.30,00:09:44.30,And I guess Tom had theimpression that I wasn't really
186,00:09:47.40,00:09:47.40,"working quite with him or forhim, but against him."
187,00:09:50.07,00:09:50.07,"- All right, now,let me ask you this."
188,00:09:52.57,00:09:52.57,"Lex, all I had to dois vote one time"
189,00:09:53.90,00:09:53.90,"to get you off,anytime I wanted."
190,00:09:56.07,00:09:56.07,"- I know that, but..."
191,00:09:57.13,00:09:57.13,- Anytime I wanted to.
192,00:09:58.50,00:09:58.50,"All I had to go like this,L-E-X, and you know what?"
193,00:10:01.90,00:10:01.90,"- You know what, I could havedone the same thing."
194,00:10:03.37,00:10:03.37,- That's right.
195,00:10:04.80,00:10:04.80,"- Tom, I want to go back tocamp with you and I square."
196,00:10:07.63,00:10:07.63,"But I don't want you walkingback there, thinking that the"
197,00:10:09.47,00:10:09.47,only reason I'm still in thegame is by your good graces.
198,00:10:11.33,00:10:11.33,- I'm not...
199,00:10:12.63,00:10:12.63,- I'm not here because anybodycarried me along.
200,00:10:14.97,00:10:14.97,No one carried me here.
201,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,You're responsible becauseyou're here.
202,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,I'm responsiblebecause I'm here.
203,00:10:19.80,00:10:19.80,It's not because Big Tom did Lexa favor that I'm here.
204,00:10:22.03,00:10:22.03,- I haven't saved you.
205,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,- We've coveredeach other.
206,00:10:24.63,00:10:24.63,"- Right, and the thing aboutit, Lex, we've got three more"
207,00:10:27.17,00:10:27.17,"days, and I'm not going to fallout in three days."
208,00:10:29.63,00:10:29.63,- All right.
209,00:10:30.80,00:10:30.80,- The thing between me and Lex
210,00:10:32.53,00:10:32.53,"is basically a case of paranoia,and ""worry-ation."""
211,00:10:37.27,00:10:37.27,But my alliance with Lex and
212,00:10:38.60,00:10:38.60,"Ethan has not, you know,has not quivered."
213,00:10:42.43,00:10:42.43,- Let's...
214,00:10:42.43,00:10:42.43,- I don't have to.
215,00:10:44.37,00:10:44.37,- You're not going toshake on the fact...
216,00:10:46.40,00:10:46.40,- I don't have tomake another alliance.
217,00:10:48.10,00:10:48.10,"Today is the day we're going togo vote, and I don't want you to"
218,00:10:51.83,00:10:51.83,feel likeyou're obligated to me.
219,00:10:54.70,00:10:54.70,- I can't forget about what Tomhas done for me in the past.
220,00:10:56.97,00:10:56.97,We could thank each otherequally for still being here.
221,00:11:00.80,00:11:00.80,So I would not feel right aboutcutting him off at the knees
222,00:11:04.83,00:11:04.83,because on a couple of occasionshe's fallen from grace.
223,00:11:11.10,00:11:11.10,"- You know, the handshake'sa big deal to him."
224,00:11:12.83,00:11:12.83,"He said, ""I alreadyshook your hand once,"
225,00:11:14.23,00:11:14.23,"I don't need to shakeit again."""
226,00:11:16.67,00:11:16.67,"I said, ""All right."""
227,00:11:20.07,00:11:20.07,- We're taking a gamblebringing Tom in.
228,00:11:22.87,00:11:22.87,"- Yes, we are."
229,00:11:23.93,00:11:23.93,"But, I mean,are you willing at"
230,00:11:25.53,00:11:25.53,this point to dissolvethe original pact?
231,00:11:28.67,00:11:28.67,"- No, I'm not."
232,00:11:29.83,00:11:29.83,- And I'm not either.
233,00:11:40.73,00:11:40.73,"- Last night and this morning,there were some tough and trying"
234,00:11:43.50,00:11:43.50,"times, so we decided to takesome time and go up to Bull"
235,00:11:46.60,00:11:46.60,Rocks and just sort of Zen-outfor a while.
236,00:11:50.97,00:11:50.97,What a view.
237,00:11:52.13,00:11:52.13,- Isn't it incredible?
238,00:11:54.97,00:11:54.97,"- When you go up to Bull Rocks,it's so peaceful, and we can"
239,00:11:57.97,00:11:57.97,"also get a look down at ourboma, which gives you a"
240,00:12:00.77,00:12:00.77,"different perspective on things,and you just can't help but"
241,00:12:03.50,00:12:03.50,think about stuff.
242,00:12:05.37,00:12:05.37,- We've been living in thatlittle circle for 36 days.
243,00:12:08.90,00:12:08.90,- Yeah.
244,00:12:11.03,00:12:11.03,- This has been the ultimateadventure for me.
245,00:12:14.20,00:12:14.20,"Every little bit of myself,"
246,00:12:15.80,00:12:15.80,my being has been touchedin some little way.
247,00:12:18.67,00:12:18.67,- It really says the remotenessof the whole thing.
248,00:12:23.77,00:12:23.77,"- To walk away with thatmillion takes a lot of luck,"
249,00:12:26.00,00:12:26.00,and so far I've beenpretty lucky.
250,00:12:29.03,00:12:29.03,I'm just extremely happythat I made it this far.
251,00:12:32.63,00:12:32.63,So I'm going to suck it in alittle bit and enjoy it.
252,00:12:37.00,00:12:37.00,"- Three more days,we can't see this anymore."
253,00:12:39.23,00:12:39.23,"- Take it all in,cowboys."
254,00:12:41.33,00:12:41.33,It feels great to bethe last woman standing.
255,00:12:44.77,00:12:44.77,"I may make it tothe final three,"
256,00:12:45.80,00:12:45.80,but I have to do thaton my own power.
257,00:12:47.67,00:12:47.67,I have not won animmunity challenge yet.
258,00:12:49.80,00:12:49.80,I have not won a rewardchallenge either.
259,00:12:51.73,00:12:51.73,"But that's notto say that it can't happen,"
260,00:12:53.17,00:12:53.17,and nobody would be happier thanme if I could pull it off
261,00:12:56.40,00:12:56.40,and buy myselfanother day or two here.
262,00:13:01.40,00:13:01.40,"- Playing the game for me,at this point,"
263,00:13:02.73,00:13:02.73,has becomeall about winning.
264,00:13:05.53,00:13:05.53,"Damn it, I'm going to walk awaywith that prize."
265,00:13:09.77,00:13:09.77,"I am here for one thing and onething only, to take that million"
266,00:13:13.83,00:13:13.83,"dollars, and to run with it,it's mine."

276,00:14:00.80,00:14:00.80,"about past membersof Moto Maji, you know,"
277,00:14:04.13,00:14:04.13,people that are onthe jury right now.
278,00:14:06.23,00:14:06.23,And whoever gets the most
279,00:14:07.53,00:14:07.53,"questions right,then they get immunity."
280,00:14:10.97,00:14:10.97,- Who were Frank'sother kids name?

282,00:14:15.00,00:14:15.00,- I don't know.
283,00:14:16.70,00:14:16.70,"- That's another mental game,and I'm not that strong in that"
284,00:14:19.33,00:14:19.33,"game, and it willbe tough with me."

286,00:14:24.83,00:14:24.83,"- Tom, I have no idea."
287,00:14:27.77,00:14:27.77,One thing thatI'm worried about is
288,00:14:29.23,00:14:29.23,"if I get a question wrong,about one of the jurors that,"
289,00:14:33.03,00:14:33.03,"you know, I was supposedlyclose with,"
290,00:14:34.77,00:14:34.77,it could play a little biton the jurors if they just think
291,00:14:37.13,00:14:37.13,you went through the motion ofpretending to ask them important
292,00:14:39.53,00:14:39.53,questions and not reallylistening to the answers.
293,00:14:42.70,00:14:42.70,- I think Kim's goingto be strong.
294,00:14:43.87,00:14:43.87,"- I do, too."

517,00:27:49.13,00:27:49.13,- At least.
518,00:27:50.17,00:27:50.17,It just didn't stop.
519,00:27:51.83,00:27:51.83,The game of Survivor nevertakes a time-out.
520,00:27:53.70,00:27:53.70,It's the real deal.

524,00:28:01.70,00:28:01.70,"to you,that's just tough."
525,00:28:06.67,00:28:06.67,It is a road trip.
526,00:28:07.87,00:28:07.87,Just follow the moon.
527,00:28:09.20,00:28:09.20,"- You can't predict anythingin this game,"
528,00:28:10.87,00:28:10.87,that's why it'san amazing game.
529,00:28:12.40,00:28:12.40,It's twists and turns and youcan't control it and that makes
530,00:28:16.23,00:28:16.23,"it exciting,and frustrating and new,"
531,00:28:20.07,00:28:20.07,"you know, you can't predictanything."

559,00:30:29.00,00:30:29.00,and that justmakes my life better.
560,00:30:31.50,00:30:31.50,That's really whatcounts to me.
561,00:30:36.23,00:30:36.23,"- It is very hard out here,"
562,00:30:38.43,00:30:38.43,harder than I everexpected it to be.
563,00:30:40.13,00:30:40.13,I think I've accomplished enoughjust by being here.
564,00:30:44.80,00:30:44.80,"- I do have a charmed andwonderful life, I appreciate it"
565,00:30:47.53,00:30:47.53,"more since I've been out here,because the little things that"
566,00:30:50.00,00:30:50.00,"you take for granted liketurning on that faucet of water,"
567,00:30:53.03,00:30:53.03,"crawling in at bed at night, youdon't have that here in Africa."
568,00:30:57.57,00:30:57.57,"- Mother Africa is just thiswonderful, wonderful place."
569,00:31:02.57,00:31:02.57,"I've grown, I've learned, it wasan amazing adventure."
570,00:31:11.10,00:31:11.10,"- I had planned on winning thewhole thing, obviously, I mean,"
571,00:31:12.57,00:31:12.57,you come here to win.
572,00:31:14.10,00:31:14.10,"You know, it was an unbelievableexperience, unbelievable game."
573,00:31:16.63,00:31:16.63,"I'd play the gametomorrow, I'd play it next year."
574,00:31:20.67,00:31:20.67,- I'm an athlete.
575,00:31:22.13,00:31:22.13,"I love to compete, but I'd muchrather do it in a civilized"
576,00:31:24.50,00:31:24.50,environment where I'm not
577,00:31:25.67,00:31:25.67,battling manipulationand back-stabbing.
578,00:31:29.97,00:31:29.97,This game is a serious emotionalroller-coaster ride.
579,00:31:34.90,00:31:34.90,"- I kind of assumed aleadership role from like,"
580,00:31:36.77,00:31:36.77,"day one, and thenthe incident with Diane"
581,00:31:38.50,00:31:38.50,"kind of like, threw me downto the bottom."
582,00:31:41.27,00:31:41.27,"I went from, like, the CEO ofthe company to the janitor."
583,00:31:46.40,00:31:46.40,- I can't helpbut be myself.
584,00:31:49.50,00:31:49.50,"It was hard for me not to havefriends in different places,"
585,00:31:51.03,00:31:51.03,"and that kind of screwed me, buthey, I made it past the hard"
586,00:31:53.30,00:31:53.30,part withthe boulders and whatnot.
587,00:31:55.07,00:31:55.07,"And for a skinny girl, you know,it's a big deal."
588,00:31:59.20,00:31:59.20,- The funniestthing that I'm going to miss
589,00:32:00.57,00:32:00.57,the most is thechallenges.
590,00:32:02.37,00:32:02.37,"I had come in like second orthird on all the challenges, me."
591,00:32:05.97,00:32:05.97,I won that onewith Frank that
592,00:32:07.23,00:32:07.23,"was like the most physical onewe've had,"
593,00:32:09.23,00:32:09.23,and nobody will evertake me for granted again.
594,00:32:13.97,00:32:13.97,- Not only is the game achallenge to me physically and
595,00:32:16.50,00:32:16.50,"mentally for my competitivespirit, but just being out here"
596,00:32:19.13,00:32:19.13,in this isolation under theseconditions is also therapeutic.
597,00:32:25.47,00:32:25.47,- The game isn't really everbeen about the money for me.
598,00:32:27.67,00:32:27.67,"It's been about coming out hereand doing something like this,"
599,00:32:29.97,00:32:29.97,which is just an amazingexperience.
600,00:32:33.07,00:32:33.07,"When you take a step back,you're like wow, I mean, who"

604,00:32:44.03,00:32:44.03,not be here long and that's justpart of the game.
605,00:32:51.40,00:32:51.40,- I have met16 of the greatest

625,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,"importantly, decides who goeswith them for that final vote."

634,00:37:01.07,00:37:01.07,The bad news isit's only 9:00 a.m.
635,00:37:03.10,00:37:03.10,The sun hasn't even begunto heat up yet.
636,00:37:06.40,00:37:06.40,"Stay strong,remember, keep your"
637,00:37:07.67,00:37:07.67,"feet on the logs, your handon the idol."
638,00:37:10.47,00:37:10.47,You guys havecome a long way.
639,00:37:41.47,00:37:41.47,Another update for you.
640,00:37:43.50,00:37:43.50,Two hours.

642,00:37:45.73,00:37:45.73,the sun is as hot as ithas ever been.
643,00:37:48.90,00:37:48.90,"Draw on whatever you have left,keep your hand on that idol."
644,00:38:01.33,00:38:01.33,"Ethan, your foot came off,after two hours, 26 minutes,"
645,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,you're out of the game.
646,00:38:13.13,00:38:13.13,- We're nuts doing this.
647,00:38:14.47,00:38:14.47,I should be old enoughto know better.
648,00:38:29.87,00:38:29.87,"- No matter what you guys arefeeling, keep going, all right,"
649,00:38:32.00,00:38:32.00,because it doesn'tfeel good to let go.
650,00:38:36.77,00:38:36.77,Give it everythingyou've got.
651,00:38:37.87,00:38:37.87,Don't leaveanything up there.
652,00:38:39.53,00:38:39.53,All right?
653,00:38:41.17,00:38:41.17,- Thanks.
654,00:38:48.20,00:38:48.20,"- I worked my butt off to getright here, and I go and I blow"
655,00:38:50.43,00:38:50.43,it on such a silly littlemistake.
656,00:38:55.97,00:38:55.97,I just lost concentration.
657,00:38:58.07,00:38:58.07,"My back foot came off, andthat's the killer."
658,00:39:01.13,00:39:01.13,I can never everget to that spot again.
659,00:39:03.43,00:39:03.43,It feels horrible.
660,00:39:05.17,00:39:05.17,It feels horrible.
661,00:39:11.90,00:39:11.90,- You're stillin the game.
662,00:39:13.57,00:39:13.57,- I pretendI'm someplace else.
663,00:39:14.77,00:39:14.77,- Where are you?
664,00:39:16.00,00:39:16.00,"- Lying on the beach,roasting in the sun,"
665,00:39:18.83,00:39:18.83,with a Planter'sPunch at my side.
666,00:39:21.70,00:39:21.70,"- You figure six, seven,eight more hours of this?"
667,00:39:33.87,00:39:33.87,"- Kim looks strong,but Lex is just as strong."
668,00:39:37.93,00:39:37.93,"Neither of them will give up,because they want the choice to"
669,00:39:41.07,00:39:41.07,bring whoever they wantto the final two.
670,00:39:49.93,00:39:49.93,- My belly is going to...you know.
671,00:39:51.47,00:39:51.47,- Huh?
672,00:39:52.57,00:39:52.57,- My belly's gonna...
673,00:39:54.17,00:39:54.17,"- Got the worst of it over,right?"
674,00:39:55.60,00:39:55.60,"- Yeah, it's just...I'm just drained."
675,00:39:59.70,00:39:59.70,- Lex had problems with hisstomach all night last night.
676,00:40:03.30,00:40:03.30,"He was up like, ten times goingto the bathroom."
677,00:40:06.60,00:40:06.60,I'm sure he's dehydrated.
678,00:40:08.50,00:40:08.50,The sun isridiculous right now.
679,00:40:10.93,00:40:10.93,It's hot.
680,00:40:36.97,00:40:36.97,"- (Probst)Lex, you're out."
681,00:40:39.37,00:40:39.37,"Three hours, 21 minutes."
682,00:40:41.53,00:40:41.53,"Kim,you have immunity."
683,00:40:47.70,00:40:47.70,"- The final immunity challengewas not luck, was not being"
684,00:40:52.23,00:40:52.23,"nice, was not any of the thingsthat I had done so far."
685,00:40:55.43,00:40:55.43,"That was something thatcame out of me inside of me,"
686,00:40:59.07,00:40:59.07,"a determination that I haven'tseen in me, maybe ever."
687,00:41:07.50,00:41:07.50,♪♪
688,00:41:23.37,00:41:23.37,"- In your wildest dreams, youknow, things like this happen."
689,00:41:25.80,00:41:25.80,"It doesn't everreally happen to you,"
690,00:41:27.43,00:41:27.43,but it shows that dreamscome true.
691,00:41:29.47,00:41:29.47,I never thoughtI'd see this again.
692,00:41:32.03,00:41:32.03,I thought I'd... I never thoughtI'd see it ever.
693,00:41:35.23,00:41:35.23,"- You've gota little streak going on, huh?"
694,00:41:38.13,00:41:38.13,- I never thoughtI'd see it ever.
695,00:41:40.53,00:41:40.53,"I'm very stunned now that I'min the final two, when I can"
696,00:41:44.80,00:41:44.80,"remember thinking the firstnight here, ""Oh, my God,"
697,00:41:47.87,00:41:47.87,"I'm going to bethe first one voted off."""
698,00:41:50.50,00:41:50.50,"Lex, Ethan, let's go."
699,00:42:03.37,00:42:03.37,- I'm glad the threeof us are here... you know?
700,00:42:06.70,00:42:06.70,"- Thank you, I'm glad we'rehere, too."
701,00:42:08.97,00:42:08.97,- It's a good...
702,00:42:10.23,00:42:10.23,"- We had a good bond,right from the beginning."
703,00:42:12.43,00:42:12.43,"- We all needed each other toget here, that's for sure."
704,00:42:14.33,00:42:14.33,"- Yeah, that's for sure."
705,00:42:15.70,00:42:15.70,"- You know, what will beweighing heavy on our minds and"
706,00:42:18.60,00:42:18.60,on our hearts today is wonderingwhich one of us is out of the
707,00:42:23.03,00:42:23.03,game tonight and which one of usis going to be here until the
708,00:42:26.70,00:42:26.70,"very end,until the final two."
709,00:42:28.63,00:42:28.63,"Only one of us can stay, andthat's all up to Mama Cat."
710,00:42:32.43,00:42:32.43,"Regardless of what happens, Iwas proud to play the game with"
711,00:42:35.13,00:42:35.13,you and I was proud to have analliance with you.
712,00:42:37.30,00:42:37.30,"- Me, too."
713,00:42:38.53,00:42:38.53,- Really. I mean it.
714,00:42:40.93,00:42:40.93,- It worked outreally well.
715,00:42:44.23,00:42:44.23,My destiny is definitely in
716,00:42:45.70,00:42:45.70,"someone else's hands,and it's a scary feeling."
717,00:42:48.27,00:42:48.27,I've never been in that
718,00:42:49.93,00:42:49.93,"situation before, and I feelvery vulnerable."
719,00:42:53.23,00:42:53.23,"You know,my stomach's in knots."
720,00:42:54.80,00:42:54.80,I don't know whatto think.
721,00:42:56.23,00:42:56.23,"I mean, I couldbe going home tonight."
722,00:42:57.73,00:42:57.73,"I could... you know, I could behere tomorrow."
723,00:43:01.27,00:43:01.27,You might understand becauseyou've been aligned with Lex and
724,00:43:04.47,00:43:04.47,it's probably a big decisionfor you.
725,00:43:06.13,00:43:06.13,"- It's a harddecision anyway,"
726,00:43:07.97,00:43:07.97,"you know, making two whenthere are three."
727,00:43:10.60,00:43:10.60,"- You've got a really,really hard job ahead of you."
728,00:43:13.63,00:43:13.63,- I'm just trying to think ofall kinds of things that would
729,00:43:16.63,00:43:16.63,"make me be able to make adecision easier,"
730,00:43:19.40,00:43:19.40,do you knowwhat I mean?
731,00:43:20.70,00:43:20.70,"I mean, I love you both equally,absolutely equally."
732,00:43:23.47,00:43:23.47,- I know.
733,00:43:24.50,00:43:24.50,- It's just...it's just horrible.
734,00:43:26.53,00:43:26.53,"I mean, it's not justthe biggest decision here."
735,00:43:28.57,00:43:28.57,It's probably one of the biggestdecisions in my life.
736,00:43:30.87,00:43:30.87,"- You're in a tough, tough,tough situation."
737,00:43:33.60,00:43:33.60,"When you won today, that was abittersweet victory, but it also"
738,00:43:37.77,00:43:37.77,comes with great reward.
739,00:43:39.50,00:43:39.50,- Deciding who I'm going tovote off tonight would be more
740,00:43:42.93,00:43:42.93,of a strategic move if I thoughtone of the two of them would be
741,00:43:46.03,00:43:46.03,more easily beatablethan the other.
742,00:43:47.90,00:43:47.90,And I wish that nobodyhad to feel bad about it.
743,00:43:50.17,00:43:50.17,That's the double-edged swordof winning this immunity.
744,00:43:53.67,00:43:53.67,"That I have to do, you know,something that will pain me and"
745,00:43:56.33,00:43:56.33,it will pain the person that Idon't bring with me
746,00:43:57.63,00:43:57.63,to the final two.
747,00:43:59.43,00:43:59.43,There's nothingfun about that.
748,00:44:15.07,00:44:15.07,- We will now bring inthe six members of our jury.
749,00:44:29.73,00:44:29.73,And then therewere three.
750,00:44:32.20,00:44:32.20,"A long day today,it started very, very early."
751,00:44:36.40,00:44:36.40,Let's talk about the immunitychallenge.
752,00:44:39.37,00:44:39.37,"Kim, today, in an absolute testof willpower,"
753,00:44:44.07,00:44:44.07,"you, a 56-year-oldgrandma, took on two young, fit,"
754,00:44:47.90,00:44:47.90,"able-bodied guys, and you kickedtheir ass."
755,00:44:50.87,00:44:50.87,You earned that immunity.
756,00:44:53.20,00:44:53.20,Tell meabout it today.
757,00:44:55.37,00:44:55.37,"- It was strictly just staminaand guts going on, and there was"
758,00:44:59.17,00:44:59.17,something inside of memaking me stay.
759,00:45:01.57,00:45:01.57,It went beyond the game.
760,00:45:03.03,00:45:03.03,"It was something that I neededto do for me, to show me that"
761,00:45:06.93,00:45:06.93,I could do something.
762,00:45:08.27,00:45:08.27,To will myselfto do something
763,00:45:09.67,00:45:09.67,that I really didn't think I wascapable of.
764,00:45:11.70,00:45:11.70,"- Ethan, what wasit like for you?"
765,00:45:13.90,00:45:13.90,"It was tough,obviously."
766,00:45:15.20,00:45:15.20,- It wasvery tough for me.
767,00:45:16.87,00:45:16.87,"You know, I thought I would havedone better, and you know,"
768,00:45:20.07,00:45:20.07,I thoughtI would have been stronger.
769,00:45:21.67,00:45:21.67,"You know, it's going tobug me for a while."
770,00:45:23.63,00:45:23.63,It's going to take a long timeto be able to get over that.
771,00:45:26.50,00:45:26.50,"- Lex, you, too,were fighting it."
772,00:45:28.50,00:45:28.50,You hung on as longas you could.
773,00:45:30.20,00:45:30.20,What finally happened?
774,00:45:32.17,00:45:32.17,- It boiled down toa physical problem.
775,00:45:33.83,00:45:33.83,"I finally did not have thestrength to stand anymore, and"
776,00:45:37.00,00:45:37.00,my mind and my will and my pridewould have had me up there
777,00:45:41.10,00:45:41.10,another three hours.
778,00:45:42.40,00:45:42.40,"But my body wasn't ready todeliver, and it didn't."
779,00:45:46.53,00:45:46.53,And the strongest person won.
780,00:45:49.27,00:45:49.27,- Here's where we're at...
781,00:45:51.57,00:45:51.57,"You can't vote for Kim,she has immunity."
782,00:45:54.07,00:45:54.07,"The rules clearly state youcan't vote for yourself,"
783,00:45:56.93,00:45:56.93,"which means Lex,you can only vote for Ethan."
784,00:45:59.23,00:45:59.23,"Ethan, you can onlyvote for Lex."
785,00:46:01.10,00:46:01.10,No needfor you guys to vote.
786,00:46:02.50,00:46:02.50,Your votes nullifyeach other.
787,00:46:04.17,00:46:04.17,"Therefore, the only person whowill vote tonight is Kim."
788,00:46:07.83,00:46:07.83,"Obviously,Kim, lots of reasons"
789,00:46:09.70,00:46:09.70,why you might pick one guyover another.
790,00:46:12.07,00:46:12.07,"The only questionI have for you is,"
791,00:46:14.73,00:46:14.73,do you want to hear fromthese guys as to why they think
792,00:46:17.57,00:46:17.57,"they should stay, or have youalready made up your mind?"
793,00:46:20.60,00:46:20.60,- I actually haven'tmade up my mind yet.
794,00:46:23.23,00:46:23.23,This is probably the most
795,00:46:24.87,00:46:24.87,bittersweet thing that's everhappened to me.
796,00:46:27.40,00:46:27.40,I just feel so bad thatI can't choose both of them.
797,00:46:30.77,00:46:30.77,I almost wish that one of themhad the immunity and I didn't
798,00:46:33.30,00:46:33.30,even have tomake this decision.
799,00:46:34.77,00:46:34.77,If they have anythingthey would
800,00:46:36.27,00:46:36.27,"like to say,I would love to hear it."
801,00:46:38.03,00:46:38.03,"- Lex, anything youwant to say?"
802,00:46:40.80,00:46:40.80,"- I want you to vote, vote yourheart and don't look back"
803,00:46:44.70,00:46:44.70,and don'tregret anything because...
804,00:46:47.63,00:46:47.63,it'll be all right.
805,00:46:48.93,00:46:48.93,And that's fine.
806,00:46:50.03,00:46:50.03,"- (Probst) How about you,Ethan?"
807,00:46:52.03,00:46:52.03,- Do whatmakes you feel good inside.
808,00:46:55.63,00:46:55.63,- I know.
809,00:46:57.53,00:46:57.53,"- (Probst) Okay, Kim."
810,00:46:58.77,00:46:58.77,And thisis the last time you
811,00:47:00.60,00:47:00.60,will have any controlover this game.
812,00:47:02.87,00:47:02.87,"After 38 days of being incontrol, after tonight's vote,"
813,00:47:06.97,00:47:06.97,all the power goes to the sixmembers we already have on our
814,00:47:10.67,00:47:10.67,jury and the seventh that you'reabout to add.
815,00:47:13.77,00:47:13.77,Time towrite down a name.
816,00:47:15.57,00:47:15.57,You're up.
817,00:47:37.10,00:47:37.10,- Please forgive me.
818,00:47:38.50,00:47:38.50,This is probably the hardestthing I've ever had to do.
819,00:47:41.53,00:47:41.53,"You've been an incrediblecompetitor, a great friend."
820,00:47:46.13,00:47:46.13,"If I could come up with awonderful reason,"
821,00:47:48.53,00:47:48.53,I'd love togive it to you.
822,00:47:50.03,00:47:50.03,I know we'll alwaysbe friends.
823,00:48:11.63,00:48:11.63,- I'll go tally the vote.
824,00:48:44.27,00:48:44.27,"Once the vote is read,the decision is final."
825,00:48:46.33,00:48:46.33,The person willbe asked to leave
826,00:48:47.43,00:48:47.43,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
827,00:48:49.50,00:48:49.50,I'll read the vote.
828,00:48:55.40,00:48:55.40,The 14th personvoted out of the tribe...
829,00:48:59.63,00:48:59.63,Lex.
830,00:49:12.93,00:49:12.93,- Congratulations.
831,00:49:13.97,00:49:13.97,Good luck.
832,00:49:32.70,00:49:32.70,"- Lex, the tribe hasspoken."
833,00:49:41.63,00:49:41.63,It's time for you to go.
834,00:49:57.00,00:49:57.00,The power is now completely inthe hands of the jury.
835,00:50:00.93,00:50:00.93,You guys have tonight andtomorrow to think about what
836,00:50:03.33,00:50:03.33,you're going to say to convinceseven people you just voted out
837,00:50:06.23,00:50:06.23,of this gameto turn around and
838,00:50:08.13,00:50:08.13,vote for you and reward you witha million dollars.
839,00:50:10.80,00:50:10.80,You can headback to camp.
840,00:50:12.30,00:50:12.30,I'll see you tomorrow.
841,00:50:15.33,00:50:15.33,"- I can honestly sayI spent 38 days here,"
842,00:50:18.70,00:50:18.70,I playedas hard as I could.
843,00:50:20.67,00:50:20.67,I played straight and honestand true.
844,00:50:23.93,00:50:23.93,"And Mom Cat,I don't have any ill feelings."
845,00:50:27.87,00:50:27.87,I've got no problem withthe vote that you cast tonight.
846,00:50:30.67,00:50:30.67,You had to votefor somebody.
847,00:50:32.13,00:50:32.13,It was a tough call.
848,00:50:33.17,00:50:33.17,- I'm surehe's really upset.
849,00:50:35.33,00:50:35.33,I did the right thing.
850,00:50:37.07,00:50:37.07,I really didthe right thing.
851,00:50:39.37,00:50:39.37,- No regrets.
852,00:50:47.00,00:50:47.00,♪♪
853,00:51:12.90,00:51:12.90,- Good morning.
854,00:51:13.90,00:51:13.90,- How are you?
855,00:51:16.90,00:51:16.90,It's hard to think no morenights.
856,00:51:19.27,00:51:19.27,"- No, it's not."
857,00:51:21.93,00:51:21.93,"- Final two, day 39."
858,00:51:24.23,00:51:24.23,I can't believeI'm even saying the words.
859,00:51:26.27,00:51:26.27,"Yesterday, I was concerned abouthaving to vote off one of the"
860,00:51:28.43,00:51:28.43,"two guys, and today, I can justreally... just relish being at"
861,00:51:32.53,00:51:32.53,the end here with Ethanand the final day.
862,00:51:35.47,00:51:35.47,- I'm just beside myselfthat I'm here.
863,00:51:37.90,00:51:37.90,"- Yeah, it's huge,Ethan, it's huge."
864,00:51:40.70,00:51:40.70,We've been waitinga long time for this.
865,00:51:43.70,00:51:43.70,- Today is a very good day.
866,00:51:46.47,00:51:46.47,"I am just feeling relief,a sense of joy, a sense of"
867,00:51:51.50,00:51:51.50,gratitude for Kimfor choosing me.
868,00:51:53.40,00:51:53.40,- I really couldn't be herewith a better person.
869,00:51:55.30,00:51:55.30,I am veryexcited about that.
870,00:51:56.57,00:51:56.57,"I mean that, you know,sincerely."
871,00:51:59.20,00:51:59.20,As the time drew closer todecide who to bring to the final
872,00:52:02.03,00:52:02.03,"two with me, the decision becameharder and harder."
873,00:52:05.20,00:52:05.20,But I feel thatLex thought he deserved it.
874,00:52:08.27,00:52:08.27,"I'm not so sure that Ethan felthe deserved it, and maybe"
875,00:52:12.50,00:52:12.50,ultimately that's what madethe decision easier for me.
876,00:52:15.87,00:52:15.87,- I only wontwo challenges.
877,00:52:17.20,00:52:17.20,"People might think,"
878,00:52:18.43,00:52:18.43,"""Well, just got luckyand fell into this."""
879,00:52:20.23,00:52:20.23,- You don't get here just bybeing a nice guy.
880,00:52:21.97,00:52:21.97,"I mean, you've gotto do a lot of things right."
881,00:52:24.50,00:52:24.50,"I mean, there arethings that"
882,00:52:25.83,00:52:25.83,you would do anyway just inyour life.
883,00:52:27.60,00:52:27.60,"You know, you are whoyou are when you come here."
884,00:52:31.10,00:52:31.10,- That's whatgot you here.
885,00:52:32.43,00:52:32.43,"- I think that's whatgot you here,"
886,00:52:33.60,00:52:33.60,and that'swhat gets you through.
887,00:52:40.63,00:52:40.63,"- Kim, we have to cross offour days."
888,00:52:44.13,00:52:44.13,- Don't you think this wholething will go down as one of the
889,00:52:46.57,00:52:46.57,ultimate experiences in yourentire life?
890,00:52:48.20,00:52:48.20,- Yeah.
891,00:52:50.07,00:52:50.07,"- I thought this would neverhappen, didn't you?"
892,00:52:52.53,00:52:52.53,"- Yeah, never ever."
893,00:52:53.57,00:52:53.57,"38, good-bye."
894,00:52:58.67,00:52:58.67,- Go for it.
895,00:53:05.70,00:53:05.70,Put your initials down there
896,00:53:06.90,00:53:06.90,"somewhere, and I'll put myinitials."
897,00:53:16.30,00:53:16.30,"Good, huh?"
898,00:53:17.97,00:53:17.97,- That's it.
899,00:53:17.97,00:53:17.97,- You like?
900,00:53:19.80,00:53:19.80,- I like.All done.
901,00:53:34.43,00:53:34.43,"- Tonight at Tribal Council,you know,"
902,00:53:37.00,00:53:37.00,I think it's goingto be a one-vote jury.
903,00:53:38.80,00:53:38.80,"I see myself getting the guyvotes, Lex and Tom and Frank."
904,00:53:43.37,00:53:43.37,"And I see Kim getting the girlvotes, which is Kelly,"
905,00:53:46.03,00:53:46.03,Little Kim and Teresa.
906,00:53:48.03,00:53:48.03,And Brandon is going to be maybethe swing vote.
907,00:53:53.37,00:53:53.37,Say your peace now.
908,00:53:55.73,00:53:55.73,"Better take one last look,because you're never going to be"
909,00:53:58.40,00:53:58.40,in this spot again.
910,00:53:59.47,00:53:59.47,"- Yep, never again."
911,00:54:01.83,00:54:01.83,- All right.
912,00:54:21.27,00:54:21.27,- You thinkthey'll just...
913,00:54:23.13,00:54:23.13,- I'm hoping it's not.
914,00:54:24.63,00:54:24.63,"I mean, you know, hopefully Tomwill lighten it up a bit maybe,"
915,00:54:27.87,00:54:27.87,but Lex is going to ask a deepquestion.
916,00:54:30.97,00:54:30.97,So they're going to be deepand they're going to be heavy.
917,00:54:44.13,00:54:44.13,"- I guess the experiencetonight,"
918,00:54:46.23,00:54:46.23,it'll probably be tense.
919,00:54:48.13,00:54:48.13,It's a big deal that now I'llhave to decide which person is
920,00:54:51.53,00:54:51.53,"the one that deserves to win,and not only win the money,"
921,00:54:54.77,00:54:54.77,but deservesto win the game.
922,00:54:56.33,00:54:56.33,"And to me, that's reallyimportant."
923,00:54:59.07,00:54:59.07,You might say they were an
924,00:55:00.53,00:55:00.53,unlikely pairto make it this far.
925,00:55:02.50,00:55:02.50,"If you were placing bets atthe beginning of the game, you'd"
926,00:55:04.70,00:55:04.70,probably say that Kim might havegone early because she was
927,00:55:07.83,00:55:07.83,oldest and you mighthave thought weakest.
928,00:55:10.80,00:55:10.80,"And Ethan, you might havethought might go far, because"
929,00:55:14.30,00:55:14.30,"he's going to hide under theradar for a while, but, at some"
930,00:55:16.27,00:55:16.27,"point in time,he's just not"
931,00:55:17.90,00:55:17.90,going to have bondedwith people.
932,00:55:19.83,00:55:19.83,So it's interesting that anintrovert and the oldest person
933,00:55:21.80,00:55:21.80,in the tribe are the lasttwo left.
934,00:55:29.23,00:55:29.23,- No one ends up in the finaltwo by luck or coincidence.
935,00:55:33.47,00:55:33.47,You can end up maybe inthe final four by being lucky.
936,00:55:37.97,00:55:37.97,"But, when you're in the finaltwo, that's on your own valor"
937,00:55:40.80,00:55:40.80,and that's on your own merit.
938,00:55:42.23,00:55:42.23,What's going to be reallyinteresting about tonight's
939,00:55:44.23,00:55:44.23,Tribal Council is that you lookat the seven members of
940,00:55:47.60,00:55:47.60,"the jury, and theyare all over the map."
941,00:55:50.33,00:55:50.33,They run the gamut.
942,00:55:51.63,00:55:51.63,You've got all different kindsof people with different
943,00:55:54.50,00:55:54.50,"opinions of the final two,and it is still anyone's game."
944,00:56:02.73,00:56:02.73,"- Tonight's Tribal Council,for me, will be bittersweet."
945,00:56:06.23,00:56:06.23,"Number one,the game is over."
946,00:56:08.90,00:56:08.90,"Number two, I didn't get as faras I would have liked to have"
947,00:56:11.30,00:56:11.30,"gone, which would have beenfirst or second."
948,00:56:13.43,00:56:13.43,Ideally first.
949,00:56:15.17,00:56:15.17,Also bittersweet because the twopeople that I'm trying to make
950,00:56:18.30,00:56:18.30,a decision onare two people that
951,00:56:20.70,00:56:20.70,I respect and genuinelylike a lot.
952,00:56:22.87,00:56:22.87,"Of course,the whole game's been"
953,00:56:24.07,00:56:24.07,"pretty difficult, so why shouldit change now?"
954,00:56:32.13,00:56:32.13,"- There's a lot of revengeinvolved in tonight for me,"
955,00:56:34.80,00:56:34.80,not so much revenge as justsatisfaction because...
956,00:56:40.03,00:56:40.03,I don't reallycare for one of the people
957,00:56:41.47,00:56:41.47,that are up theretonight.
958,00:56:43.23,00:56:43.23,"And ultimately I'm going to getto vote against them, so I think"
959,00:56:45.87,00:56:45.87,that's pretty much the ultimatein satisfaction for not really
960,00:56:48.97,00:56:48.97,liking somebody.
961,00:56:50.47,00:56:50.47,But the fact that they made it39 days with so many of us who
962,00:56:54.20,00:56:54.20,"have really big personalities,you have to give them credit."
963,00:56:58.43,00:56:58.43,"I mean, anybodywho made it 39 days,"
964,00:57:00.10,00:57:00.10,you have to give themcredit.
965,00:57:09.93,00:57:09.93,- There isloyalty in this game.
966,00:57:12.57,00:57:12.57,"It's that loyalty that willcatapult you up, as seen with"
967,00:57:16.63,00:57:16.63,these two people thatare in the final.
968,00:57:18.83,00:57:18.83,They had a loyaltyto each other.
969,00:57:20.70,00:57:20.70,"But even in this game,everything gets cut loose at the"
970,00:57:23.83,00:57:23.83,end because there can only beone Survivor.
971,00:57:29.90,00:57:29.90,"- As far as making a decisionon who to vote for,"
972,00:57:32.87,00:57:32.87,I made it in2.9 seconds.
973,00:57:34.90,00:57:34.90,"As soon asI got voted off,"
974,00:57:36.50,00:57:36.50,"that night going out of TribalCouncil, I said to myself,"
975,00:57:40.00,00:57:40.00,"""Self, I know who I want to votefor in the thing."""
976,00:57:44.30,00:57:44.30,"So my question tonight,it'll not be a serious question."
977,00:57:49.07,00:57:49.07,"They're going to scratch theirhead and say,"
978,00:57:50.70,00:57:50.70,"""What kind ofstupid question did he ask?"""
979,00:57:52.87,00:57:52.87,"And that's... I want them justto laugh and think,"
980,00:57:56.90,00:57:56.90,"""How stupidhas old Tom became?"""
981,00:58:03.50,00:58:03.50,- I don't know what approachI'm going to take tonight.
982,00:58:06.13,00:58:06.13,I would liketo see them squirm.
983,00:58:08.03,00:58:08.03,"I'm the sorest loserout there,"
984,00:58:09.37,00:58:09.37,and I'll bethe first one to admit it.
985,00:58:11.07,00:58:11.07,"So after the Kelly-voted-offdebacle, which it was, because I"
986,00:58:15.20,00:58:15.20,"didn't vote for stupid Lex,but that's fine."
987,00:58:17.93,00:58:17.93,I can't wait.
988,00:58:19.83,00:58:19.83,I hope I get in thereand they're
989,00:58:20.90,00:58:20.90,quaking in theirlittle Reeboks.
990,00:58:24.03,00:58:24.03,"I just want to see fireworks,because I've been sitting there"
991,00:58:25.97,00:58:25.97,"for a really long time,"
992,00:58:27.23,00:58:27.23,and I just liketo watch things happen.
993,00:58:29.90,00:58:29.90,I want to go now!
994,00:58:57.60,00:58:57.60,- (Probst) Ready to bringin the jury?
995,00:58:59.57,00:58:59.57,- I am.
996,00:59:19.13,00:59:19.13,"- Welcome, Ethan, Kim."
997,00:59:21.93,00:59:21.93,"Welcome, jury,to the final Tribal Council."
998,00:59:26.20,00:59:26.20,"Tonight, there are twosignificant differences"
999,00:59:29.57,00:59:29.57,from any otherTribal Council.
1000,00:59:31.73,00:59:31.73,"The first one is,you two won't vote."
1001,00:59:34.10,00:59:34.10,"Tonight, onlythe jury votes."
1002,00:59:35.90,00:59:35.90,"And the other very bigdifference-- tonight, you want"
1003,00:59:38.80,00:59:38.80,to see your name onthat piece of paper.
1004,00:59:40.73,00:59:40.73,The jury is no longer votingagainst somebody.
1005,00:59:43.77,00:59:43.77,"Tonight, the juryis voting for a winner."
1006,00:59:46.63,00:59:46.63,We're going to startby giving
1007,00:59:48.23,00:59:48.23,both of you a chanceto address the jury.
1008,00:59:50.40,00:59:50.40,State your case.
1009,00:59:51.63,00:59:51.63,Why shouldthe seven that you've
1010,00:59:53.30,00:59:53.30,already voted out turn aroundand vote for you?
1011,00:59:55.73,00:59:55.73,"Kim, let's start with you."
1012,01:00:01.77,01:00:01.77,"- I can't ask you guys, like,to vote for me."
1013,01:00:04.83,01:00:04.83,"I think that when you're outhere with somebody for 39 days,"
1014,01:00:08.87,01:00:08.87,"24-7, I'm not sure I've everexperienced anything like that"
1015,01:00:12.10,01:00:12.10,"before in my life,not even with my family."
1016,01:00:15.00,01:00:15.00,So it would be very hard for meat this point to tell you
1017,01:00:19.33,01:00:19.33,something that youdon't think I am already.
1018,01:00:22.03,01:00:22.03,"The only thing I can tell you isthat, by being older than every"
1019,01:00:26.37,01:00:26.37,"single one of you, all of youmade me feel young."
1020,01:00:29.77,01:00:29.77,"You all made me feel important,without exception, each one of"
1021,01:00:33.73,01:00:33.73,you has helped me be the bestthat I can be.
1022,01:00:37.43,01:00:37.43,"And so I'm leaving here,like, a winner big time."
1023,01:00:43.57,01:00:43.57,- Ethan.
1024,01:00:45.83,01:00:45.83,"- Well, when I firstarrived here,"
1025,01:00:50.27,01:00:50.27,I setsome goals for myself.
1026,01:00:52.73,01:00:52.73,"Obviously, to last as long as Ican, but more importantly, to go"
1027,01:00:56.10,01:00:56.10,"home with my integrity and tokind of prove that good, honest"
1028,01:01:00.93,01:01:00.93,people can get farin the game.
1029,01:01:03.00,01:01:03.00,"The game consumes so muchof everyone, and sometimes it"
1030,01:01:06.00,01:01:06.00,"clouds people's personality,it clouds the way you act."
1031,01:01:08.80,01:01:08.80,It clouds the way you treatother people.
1032,01:01:10.77,01:01:10.77,So it was important for meto achieve those goals.
1033,01:01:13.90,01:01:13.90,"And if you knew me from day one,if you knew me from the switch,"
1034,01:01:16.43,01:01:16.43,"if you knew me from the merge,it's important just to,"
1035,01:01:19.63,01:01:19.63,"you know,look at the whole picture"
1036,01:01:22.27,01:01:22.27,and you've got to vote what'sin your heart.
1037,01:01:25.93,01:01:25.93,That's allI have to say.
1038,01:01:28.43,01:01:28.43,"- Okay, jury, I want youto take some time to think"
1039,01:01:33.00,01:01:33.00,"about what Ethan and Kim havejust said, because, in a moment,"
1040,01:01:37.07,01:01:37.07,you're going to each ask them aquestion that will help you
1041,01:01:40.43,01:01:40.43,decide whowill be the sole Survivor.
1042,01:01:51.13,01:01:51.13,♪♪
1043,01:01:52.73,01:01:52.73,"- (Probst)Okay, jury, here's your chance"
1044,01:01:55.70,01:01:55.70,to address the finaltwo.
1045,01:01:59.10,01:01:59.10,Here's howit's going to work.
1046,01:02:01.27,01:02:01.27,You guys can ask a questionand/or make a statement.
1047,01:02:07.00,01:02:07.00,"When you'redone, have a seat."
1048,01:02:10.77,01:02:10.77,We'll move on tothe next jury member.
1049,01:02:13.13,01:02:13.13,"Brandon, get us going."
1050,01:02:20.30,01:02:20.30,- It's kind of funny tonightbecause I honestly do not know
1051,01:02:24.07,01:02:24.07,"whose name I'm going to writedown, honestly don't."
1052,01:02:26.60,01:02:26.60,"I didn't know either one of youuntil the merge, and in the"
1053,01:02:29.97,01:02:29.97,"eight or seven or eight days wespent together, I'm not sure how"
1054,01:02:33.23,01:02:33.23,well I gotto know either one of you.
1055,01:02:35.27,01:02:35.27,"So then I started thinking,"
1056,01:02:36.67,01:02:36.67,"""Who got to know meand liked me the best?"""
1057,01:02:40.53,01:02:40.53,And I realized neither one ofyou liked me enough to keep me
1058,01:02:44.53,01:02:44.53,"around three dayslonger than Frank,"
1059,01:02:46.53,01:02:46.53,so you couldn't like methat much.
1060,01:02:48.47,01:02:48.47,"So what I want to know is,"
1061,01:02:49.93,01:02:49.93,"if the two of you weren'tsitting there,"
1062,01:02:51.87,01:02:51.87,"out of the seven of us,which person would you most like"
1063,01:02:56.20,01:02:56.20,"to see sitting there,and why?"
1064,01:02:58.40,01:02:58.40,- Ethan?
1065,01:03:00.47,01:03:00.47,- The person I would like tosee sitting next to me
1066,01:03:02.23,01:03:02.23,the mostwould be Lex.
1067,01:03:05.83,01:03:05.83,"Lex was confident, he hadextreme will, he won so many"
1068,01:03:12.13,01:03:12.13,"challenges, and if I couldbeat Lex at one of the hardest"
1069,01:03:16.23,01:03:16.23,"games around, it would be one ofthe greatest accomplishments"
1070,01:03:20.53,01:03:20.53,that I could accomplish.
1071,01:03:22.27,01:03:22.27,- (Probst) Kim.
1072,01:03:24.27,01:03:24.27,- I would definitely agreethat...
1073,01:03:26.53,01:03:26.53,"I mean,I'd have to go with Lex."
1074,01:03:27.70,01:03:27.70,He was as supportive of meas anybody here.
1075,01:03:30.97,01:03:30.97,"I mean, even at one pointI said, ""You know,"
1076,01:03:33.53,01:03:33.53,"""I can't believeI messed up this challenge."
1077,01:03:36.03,01:03:36.03,"You know, I don't have anyexcuses."""
1078,01:03:37.73,01:03:37.73,"And he said, like, ""Yes, you doyou have 56 excuses."""
1079,01:03:40.13,01:03:40.13,"And I thought that was verythoughtful, you know, that he"
1080,01:03:43.30,01:03:43.30,"would, he would, you know,say that,"
1081,01:03:44.97,01:03:44.97,and he meant itwith all sincerity.
1082,01:03:48.47,01:03:48.47,- The second part of myquestion was I wanted to know
1083,01:03:50.83,01:03:50.83,who you thought deserved to situp there the least out of
1084,01:03:53.03,01:03:53.03,"the seven of us,just tell me the name,"
1085,01:03:55.17,01:03:55.17,you don't even have tosay why.
1086,01:03:57.53,01:03:57.53,- Um... you.
1087,01:04:01.63,01:04:01.63,- That's tough.
1088,01:04:03.67,01:04:03.67,I guess...
1089,01:04:07.07,01:04:07.07,"I guess Tommy, and it's onlybecause I felt that he was,"
1090,01:04:11.77,01:04:11.77,"at the end, maybe not soin favor of women."
1091,01:04:15.57,01:04:15.57,But that's just a feeling thatI had at the end.
1092,01:04:18.17,01:04:18.17,"I think... I mean, I think he'scool because he's a guy's guy,"
1093,01:04:20.37,01:04:20.37,but that's maybe...
1094,01:04:21.77,01:04:21.77,"if I have to pick a reason,that would be the reason."
1095,01:04:24.83,01:04:24.83,"Sorry, Tom."
1096,01:04:26.90,01:04:26.90,- That's all right.

1101,01:04:41.97,01:04:41.97,- The first act of charity thatI'm absolutely going to do is to
1102,01:04:44.50,01:04:44.50,"look into this project that weall want to do as Survivors,"
1103,01:04:46.90,01:04:46.90,the Wamba project.

1106,01:04:56.57,01:04:56.57,it's something that I feelreally strongly about doing.

1110,01:05:08.60,01:05:08.60,"kids, that kind of touched meand my selfless act would be to"
1111,01:05:12.80,01:05:12.80,"give my time to some sort ofinner-city, you know, soccer"
1112,01:05:16.67,01:05:16.67,"league where I can look at thesekids, these diamonds in the"
1113,01:05:20.30,01:05:20.30,"rough and, you know, get themto start a league because the"

1115,01:05:25.57,01:05:25.57,"you know,that inspired me a little bit."

1142,01:06:57.67,01:06:57.67,I haven't talked to youin a while.
1143,01:06:59.57,01:06:59.57,I've had 15 days to sit here andthink about who was going to be
1144,01:07:03.07,01:07:03.07,across from meon this big night.
1145,01:07:05.50,01:07:05.50,"And to be totally honest, I hadhoped to see you guys on this"

1147,01:07:10.50,01:07:10.50,But it could havebeen worse.
1148,01:07:12.97,01:07:12.97,"Kim, I was surprised anddisappointed"
1149,01:07:19.13,01:07:19.13,"by your conduct mylast few days at camp,"
1150,01:07:23.30,01:07:23.30,"but you did do some greatthings, too."
1151,01:07:27.40,01:07:27.40,"You gave me something that I'vebeen wanting for a while now,"
1152,01:07:32.20,01:07:32.20,and that was giving Lexthe chance to do his own walk of

1154,01:07:38.33,01:07:38.33,"Though you totallysold me out,"

1156,01:07:44.83,01:07:44.83,But I hopeyou know that part of
1157,01:07:47.70,01:07:47.70,your success tonight comesat my expense.

1163,01:08:04.83,01:08:04.83,And I certainly didn't see youtry to make one with me.
1164,01:08:07.67,01:08:07.67,I don't knowabout everybody else.
1165,01:08:09.57,01:08:09.57,"Hence, my dilemma."

1177,01:08:58.97,01:08:58.97,opportunity to learn from.
1178,01:09:00.43,01:09:00.43,And it was more about myselfthan it was about them.
1179,01:09:03.20,01:09:03.20,It was thingsthat they showed me.
1180,01:09:05.23,01:09:05.23,"So, my questionto you guys is,"

1187,01:09:24.37,01:09:24.37,"I mean, you know, it wasn't thatyou were with the tribe with"
1188,01:09:26.93,01:09:26.93,"me for so long, it wasn't thatyou were particularly supportive"
1189,01:09:29.10,01:09:29.10,"of me, but you had the guts tocall off a wedding"
1190,01:09:35.00,01:09:35.00,that I don'tknow that I could have done.
1191,01:09:37.77,01:09:37.77,"I think that,in all my years,"
1192,01:09:39.87,01:09:39.87,I would just maybe keep doingwhat was expected of me.
1193,01:09:43.27,01:09:43.27,"And for you to have learnedthat at such a young age,"
1194,01:09:46.10,01:09:46.10,I wasn'ttoo old to learn it.
1195,01:09:47.57,01:09:47.57,And then the next thing was whenyou sort of got dealt a blow by
1196,01:09:51.90,01:09:51.90,one of your tribe members andwhen you took your...
1197,01:09:55.23,01:09:55.23,"whatever amountof time to get over it,"
1198,01:09:57.90,01:09:57.90,"your immediate reaction afterthat was, was that it was very,"
1199,01:10:00.03,01:10:00.03,very important to youto want to get back
1200,01:10:02.17,01:10:02.17,and be friendswith that person.
1201,01:10:04.07,01:10:04.07,"So you may not forget, but youwere a forgiver,"
1202,01:10:06.80,01:10:06.80,and I thinkthat that's huge.
1203,01:10:09.77,01:10:09.77,"So, I mean, I learned an amazingamount from you."
1204,01:10:13.13,01:10:13.13,"The second halfof the question,"
1205,01:10:17.83,01:10:17.83,"Tom, I'm notpicking on you, buddy,"
1206,01:10:19.63,01:10:19.63,"but I had a lot of laughswith you, and I like that."
1207,01:10:23.87,01:10:23.87,But it wasn't that I learneda whole lot.
1208,01:10:27.63,01:10:27.63,"I mean, I had a great time,but I didn't learn a lot."
1209,01:10:31.33,01:10:31.33,- Ethan.
1210,01:10:32.73,01:10:32.73,- I think I learned the mostabout myself from Teresa.
1211,01:10:36.77,01:10:36.77,I felt a bond with Teresabecause she was almost like my
1212,01:10:40.50,01:10:40.50,"safe place in this game,"
1213,01:10:44.03,01:10:44.03,"and I felt extremelycomfortable with her,"
1214,01:10:46.83,01:10:46.83,"and her willpower and herdesire to win, her desire"
1215,01:10:50.50,01:10:50.50,to be here was just such aninspiration to me and something
1216,01:10:54.23,01:10:54.23,I strive to be likeand something
1217,01:10:56.20,01:10:56.20,I'll carry awayfrom this forever.
1218,01:10:58.50,01:10:58.50,Forever.
1219,01:11:01.20,01:11:01.20,And the person I learnedthe least about from
1220,01:11:05.57,01:11:05.57,would beprobably Kelly.
1221,01:11:09.77,01:11:09.77,It seems that I didn't takeenough time to get to know Kelly
1222,01:11:15.37,01:11:15.37,and I'm sure she'sa great girl.
1223,01:11:18.87,01:11:18.87,"And I'm sure I could learna lot of things from her,"
1224,01:11:21.53,01:11:21.53,but it was a mistakethat I didn't spend as
1225,01:11:24.60,01:11:24.60,much time with heras I could have.
1226,01:11:27.93,01:11:27.93,"- Big Tom,you're next."
1227,01:11:33.73,01:11:33.73,"- First of all, I want tocongratulate both of you"
1228,01:11:35.93,01:11:35.93,"for making it this far,"
1229,01:11:38.37,01:11:38.37,and just getting there becauseit's a great accomplishment.
1230,01:11:44.73,01:11:44.73,"So I've got to ask a question,and I will."
1231,01:11:47.77,01:11:47.77,"In camp I losta little bit of weight,"
1232,01:11:50.37,01:11:50.37,and it was because ofthe mush.
1233,01:11:53.03,01:11:53.03,"Ethan, if a hyena came throughcamp and ate our mush and then"
1234,01:11:58.03,01:11:58.03,"after he ate it, he turnedaround and licked his hiney,"
1235,01:12:01.30,01:12:01.30,did he do it because that wasanimal instinct
1236,01:12:04.30,01:12:04.30,or because to get the taste ofthe mush out of his mouth?
1237,01:12:08.27,01:12:08.27,What do you think?
1238,01:12:14.13,01:12:14.13,"- Well, if I know..."
1239,01:12:16.00,01:12:16.00,"if I was a hyenaand I had eaten that mush,"
1240,01:12:20.43,01:12:20.43,it would probably be...
1241,01:12:25.73,01:12:25.73,to clean his hind endbecause I didn't mind
1242,01:12:27.10,01:12:27.10,the taste of that mush asmuch as you did.
1243,01:12:28.67,01:12:28.67,- Okay.
1244,01:12:30.07,01:12:30.07,"Kim, you cooked that mush, so itmight be a double standard"
1245,01:12:34.07,01:12:34.07,"for you,but do you understand..."
1246,01:12:36.97,01:12:36.97,"I mean, did you hear thequestion?"
1247,01:12:40.10,01:12:40.10,- I did hear it.
1248,01:12:41.10,01:12:41.10,"- Okay,what's your rebuttal?"
1249,01:12:42.67,01:12:42.67,- I'm answering the samequestion?
1250,01:12:44.23,01:12:44.23,"- Yes, ma'am."
1251,01:12:45.67,01:12:45.67,"- I would have to say thatthe hyena, you know, was just"
1252,01:12:50.87,01:12:50.87,cleaning his hind end.
1253,01:12:52.93,01:12:52.93,"I mean, the mush was the onlything he had to eat, and I would"
1254,01:12:56.10,01:12:56.10,"think that maybe, you know,he needed it to survive and when"
1255,01:12:59.13,01:12:59.13,"you get hungry enough, you eatwhat you have to eat, and taste"
1256,01:13:02.30,01:13:02.30,is one of the first luxuriesthat goes out the window.
1257,01:13:04.67,01:13:04.67,"- Thank you all andcongratulations, again,"
1258,01:13:07.30,01:13:07.30,to both of you.
1259,01:13:14.47,01:13:14.47,- Teresa.
1260,01:13:20.47,01:13:20.47,"- Well, that'sa tough act to follow."
1261,01:13:23.77,01:13:23.77,"What I'd like to ask you is,"
1262,01:13:29.00,01:13:29.00,"even trying to play withintegrity, I know there are"
1263,01:13:31.53,01:13:31.53,times when you have to saysomething about somebody that
1264,01:13:35.57,01:13:35.57,you wish you couldtake back.
1265,01:13:37.83,01:13:37.83,"So, if you could take backanything you said about any of"
1266,01:13:42.63,01:13:42.63,"the jurors,what would it be?"
1267,01:13:45.50,01:13:45.50,And who was it saidabout?
1268,01:13:51.43,01:13:51.43,"- I'm not so sure it wassomething that I said,"
1269,01:13:54.93,01:13:54.93,but it wassomething that I did.
1270,01:13:58.93,01:13:58.93,"I didn't sell Kelly out,"
1271,01:14:00.73,01:14:00.73,but I didn't know enough to goto her defense.
1272,01:14:06.33,01:14:06.33,There was a vote that was castthat I really didn't think that
1273,01:14:08.83,01:14:08.83,"was a vote of hers, but Imisjudged that it was somebody"
1274,01:14:13.07,01:14:13.07,"else, and it wassomebody else."
1275,01:14:15.37,01:14:15.37,"But it all occurred so fast,that-- and I'm not making"
1276,01:14:19.67,01:14:19.67,excuses because there is noexcuse for it--
1277,01:14:22.13,01:14:22.13,"I was wrong not to at least lookinto it better, but that's the"
1278,01:14:25.33,01:14:25.33,one thing I regret of all ofthis more than anything
1279,01:14:27.70,01:14:27.70,that I've done here.
1280,01:14:29.97,01:14:29.97,"- On a similar line, when thatsame vote was cast, this mystery"
1281,01:14:34.73,01:14:34.73,"vote thateveryone was talking about,"
1282,01:14:36.20,01:14:36.20,I had thought that votecame from Frank.
1283,01:14:40.17,01:14:40.17,"And I sat on it for a while, andI definitely mentioned my"
1284,01:14:46.23,01:14:46.23,"concerns thatit was from Frank,"
1285,01:14:47.97,01:14:47.97,and that we've got to take careof this right away.
1286,01:14:50.80,01:14:50.80,"And luckily, I didn't because itturns out that it wasn't Frank,"
1287,01:14:56.00,01:14:56.00,and I would have madethe wrong decision.
1288,01:14:58.10,01:14:58.10,"But I feel bad about, you know,accusing someone so quickly"
1289,01:15:01.53,01:15:01.53,"without, you know,going in and finding"
1290,01:15:03.87,01:15:03.87,more detail aboutthings.
1291,01:15:08.10,01:15:08.10,- I congratulate you both.
1292,01:15:09.60,01:15:09.60,"I think you both deserve to bethere, and I'm crazy about both"
1293,01:15:12.00,01:15:12.00,"of you, so good luck."
1294,01:15:16.00,01:15:16.00,"- (Probst) Okay, jury."
1295,01:15:17.93,01:15:17.93,You have a bigdecision to make.
1296,01:15:19.67,01:15:19.67,You're about to reward somebodywith a million dollars
1297,01:15:25.10,01:15:25.10,and the title of Survivor.
1298,01:15:28.47,01:15:28.47,I'll give you a minute to thinkabout that decision.
1299,01:15:41.30,01:15:41.30,♪♪
1300,01:15:46.97,01:15:46.97,"- (Probst) Okay, jury,it's time for the final vote."
1301,01:15:49.67,01:15:49.67,"I just want to remind you,tonight you are not voting"
1302,01:15:52.20,01:15:52.20,"against somebody,you are voting for somebody."
1303,01:15:55.40,01:15:55.40,The person you feel mostdeserving of the title
1304,01:15:58.97,01:15:58.97,"and the money,or perhaps in the case of"
1305,01:16:01.50,01:16:01.50,"a couple of you, the lesserof two evils."
1306,01:16:04.10,01:16:04.10,"Either way, you arevoting for a winner."
1307,01:16:07.10,01:16:07.10,"Brandon,you're up first."
1308,01:16:33.13,01:16:33.13,"- This is a pretty funny gamebecause I came here,"
1309,01:16:37.00,01:16:37.00,I knew my question wastotally just a way
1310,01:16:39.23,01:16:39.23,for me to getone last jab at Frank.
1311,01:16:41.13,01:16:41.13,I totally was going to votefor Ethan
1312,01:16:43.57,01:16:43.57,without eventhinking about it.
1313,01:16:45.17,01:16:45.17,But you know what?
1314,01:16:46.53,01:16:46.53,"Ethan was so stupid, he slammedme on my own question."
1315,01:16:50.60,01:16:50.60,So you don't slam somebody ontheir own question and say you
1316,01:16:53.73,01:16:53.73,would be the least likely topick that person and then expect
1317,01:16:56.93,01:16:56.93,them to vote for you.
1318,01:16:58.40,01:16:58.40,"So, Kim's just as deserving asEthan, and it's kind of cool"
1319,01:17:02.17,01:17:02.17,that a 56-year-old woman didreally well.
1320,01:17:04.73,01:17:04.73,So... and she didn't slam meon my own question.
1321,01:17:07.77,01:17:07.77,"Dumb, Ethan, so stupid."
1322,01:17:52.60,01:17:52.60,"- This was just an unbelievablyhard decision for me to make,"
1323,01:17:56.13,01:17:56.13,and I have to say that I camein here tonight thinking that
1324,01:18:00.87,01:18:00.87,I would be voting for Ethan.
1325,01:18:02.90,01:18:02.90,I think I realized that both youand Ethan were absolutely
1326,01:18:07.53,01:18:07.53,amazing competitorsin very different ways.
1327,01:18:10.33,01:18:10.33,And I was extremely impressedwith both of you.
1328,01:18:12.73,01:18:12.73,And it wasa very hard decision for me.
1329,01:18:14.80,01:18:14.80,"Kim, you impressedme so much."
1330,01:18:17.27,01:18:17.27,"You're 56 years old and you area really strong woman, and for"
1331,01:18:21.73,01:18:21.73,"whatever reason, I just...I think you deserve to win."
1332,01:18:53.53,01:18:53.53,"- Just like a woman in my hometown, stuck a knife in my back."
1333,01:18:58.40,01:18:58.40,"Everything that goes aroundcomes around, and, Kim, you lost"
1334,01:19:02.17,01:19:02.17,"two or three challenges, andI felt sorry for you."
1335,01:19:05.30,01:19:05.30,"But then I decided we'd keepthe weakest woman, and you was"
1336,01:19:09.70,01:19:09.70,"the weakestone and you rode me,"
1337,01:19:11.73,01:19:11.73,Ethan and Lex's coattail to getwhere you are.
1338,01:19:15.37,01:19:15.37,But you're not Dorothy and youcan't click them shoes and do
1339,01:19:19.97,01:19:19.97,"something miraculousthis time,"
1340,01:19:21.87,01:19:21.87,because your failure'scaught up with you.
1341,01:19:24.43,01:19:24.43,"And no, I'm not whispering likeyou tell me every morning."
1342,01:19:27.87,01:19:27.87,"Tonight it's my turn to tellyou, shh, I'm hushing you."
1343,01:19:31.07,01:19:31.07,"Shut up, you're done."
1344,01:19:33.40,01:19:33.40,"Ethan, the best man,has won."
1345,01:19:35.30,01:19:35.30,"The weak one,you have not."
1346,01:19:39.53,01:19:39.53,I don't careif they did hear it.
1347,01:19:53.03,01:19:53.03,- Well-deserved.
1348,01:20:06.40,01:20:06.40,"- Benjamin, isn't theresomething you wanted to tell me?"
1349,01:20:09.43,01:20:09.43,"Oh, yes, Mrs. Robinson,"
1350,01:20:10.77,01:20:10.77,thank you very much for theopportunity.
1351,01:20:12.53,01:20:12.53,"No, no, Benjamin."
1352,01:20:13.90,01:20:13.90,The room number.
1353,01:20:15.23,01:20:15.23,568.
1354,01:20:17.87,01:20:17.87, The Graduate was myfavorite movie.
1355,01:20:19.80,01:20:19.80,Congratulations.
1356,01:20:29.20,01:20:29.20,"- For the last time inAfrica, I'll go tally the votes."
1357,01:20:42.33,01:20:42.33,(no voices)
1358,01:21:05.87,01:21:05.87,♪♪
1359,01:21:32.10,01:21:32.10,"- Ethan, Kim."
1360,01:21:34.00,01:21:34.00,"Jury, 39 daysis a long time."
1361,01:21:38.53,01:21:38.53,"39 days out here,in Africa,"
1362,01:21:42.67,01:21:42.67,"in what has been,without question,"
1363,01:21:44.43,01:21:44.43,the most physically demandingand mentally challenging
1364,01:21:47.70,01:21:47.70,environment Survivor has ever taken place in.
1365,01:21:50.23,01:21:50.23,Life-changing.
1366,01:21:51.70,01:21:51.70,"But, as Lex said, you don't getto this spot by accident"
1367,01:21:57.43,01:21:57.43,or by coincidence.
1368,01:21:58.87,01:21:58.87,You get herebecause you earned it.
1369,01:22:00.53,01:22:00.53,"No matter how you break it down,no matter how you justify it or"
1370,01:22:02.77,01:22:02.77,"apologize for it, you're here,they're not."
1371,01:22:06.40,01:22:06.40,"So, now thatthe votes have been cast,"
1372,01:22:09.20,01:22:09.20,nothing you can do to helpyourself or hurt yourself.
1373,01:22:12.13,01:22:12.13,"Kim, before I read these,anything that you want to maybe"
1374,01:22:17.67,01:22:17.67,admit to that you wouldn't wantto have admitted to during
1375,01:22:20.43,01:22:20.43,"the game, because it mighthave affected the vote,"
1376,01:22:22.80,01:22:22.80,"but now that everything's done,you're willing to give up?"
1377,01:22:26.83,01:22:26.83,"- Um... I guess if the truthmust be known, I was probably"
1378,01:22:31.63,01:22:31.63,really scared out there a lotof the time.
1379,01:22:34.57,01:22:34.57,I may not have coveredit as well as I thought.
1380,01:22:39.43,01:22:39.43,"And I think I was, I was scaredof failing, scared of letting"

1382,01:22:49.40,01:22:49.40,deserve to be there.
1383,01:22:50.87,01:22:50.87,"And then at some point,that kind of all changed for me."
1384,01:22:54.93,01:22:54.93,- (Probst) When?
1385,01:22:56.27,01:22:56.27,Do you recall--
1386,01:22:57.57,01:22:57.57,was there a moment when yougot power or what?

1388,01:23:01.63,01:23:01.63,"but in that last immunity,I felt"
1389,01:23:06.10,01:23:06.10,"like I needed to prove thatI deserved to be there, that I"
1390,01:23:11.70,01:23:11.70,"could do it on my own, that noneof you guys needed to carry me"
1391,01:23:15.80,01:23:15.80,"or it was because of my greatcooking, you know, or whatever"
1392,01:23:19.67,01:23:19.67,that I was still there.
1393,01:23:21.20,01:23:21.20,"And somehowI just held on,"
1394,01:23:24.93,01:23:24.93,"and I felt that I needed to dothat, just to prove it."
1395,01:23:30.57,01:23:30.57,"- (Probst) Were youproving it to them,"
1396,01:23:31.67,01:23:31.67,or were you proving itto yourself?

1398,01:23:39.27,01:23:39.27,but I think for me and whatI'll take away for the rest of
1399,01:23:42.87,01:23:42.87,my life is thatI did prove it to me.
