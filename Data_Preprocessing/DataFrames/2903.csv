464,00:29:38.50,00:29:38.50,IT WOULD BE AN EASY ONE TO AGREE ON.
465,00:29:40.70,00:29:40.70,BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY SHE DOES NOT HAVE A LOVED ONE.
466,00:29:46.07,00:29:46.07,>> OKAY. I'M GOING TO TARGET JULIE.
467,00:29:48.83,00:29:48.83,THIS IS MY REASON. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO REASON TO

477,00:30:18.10,00:30:18.10,"NOW IS KELLEY. SHE PLAYS VERY LOW KEY, BUT AT"
478,00:30:20.77,00:30:20.77,"THE SAME TIME, SHE'S VERY OBSERVANT."

664,00:41:51.47,00:41:51.47,BRILLIANT TRIBAL OR ABSOLUTE CHAOS?
665,00:41:53.20,00:41:53.20,TIME WILL TELL. GRAB YOUR STUFF.

680,00:42:53.30,00:42:53.30,THAN GONE AGAINST THEM RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO
681,00:42:56.13,00:42:56.13,BITE ME IN MY BUTT.
