414,00:17:05.67,00:17:05.67,>> NO.
415,00:17:06.83,00:17:06.83,THIS IS WHO MY SON IS.
416,00:17:08.38,00:17:08.38,HE IS A HERO.
417,00:17:09.58,00:17:09.58,"HONEY, I'M SO VERY PROUD OF YOU."

437,00:17:45.12,00:17:45.12,JOIN YOUR LOVED ONES.
438,00:17:46.46,00:17:46.46,YOU GUYS WILL HEAD BACK TO CAMP
439,00:17:48.29,00:17:48.29,AND SPEND THE AFTERNOON TOGETHER.
440,00:18:25.38,00:18:25.38,>> TODAY I WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED
441,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,IF MIKE WOULD HAVE KEPT HIS MOTHER

443,00:18:30.96,00:18:30.96,NO HARD FEELINGS WHATSOEVER.
444,00:18:32.88,00:18:32.88,BUT I'M SURE HE'S LOOKING FOR WINNING A MILLION DOLLARS
445,00:18:35.79,00:18:35.79,"AND WAS HOPING TO PULL IN MORE VOTES,"
446,00:18:37.58,00:18:37.58,SO HE LET FAMILY SEE THEM SIX
447,00:18:40.08,00:18:40.08,AND THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF.
448,00:18:42.21,00:18:42.21,"THAT WAS VERY HARD, MIKE."
449,00:18:44.17,00:18:44.17,YOU HAVE THE OLD FEATHER IN THE GAME.
450,00:18:46.75,00:18:46.75,THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
451,00:18:48.08,00:18:48.08,>> IT'S NOT.
452,00:18:49.29,00:18:49.29,>> IT SUCKED.
453,00:18:51.29,00:18:51.29,">> I THINK IT WAS KIND OF STUPID,"

455,00:18:55.42,00:18:55.42,HE SAID THAT'S THE WAY HE WANTED TO DO IT.
456,00:18:57.21,00:18:57.21,THAT'S SOMETHING HE HAS TO LIVE WITH.
457,00:18:59.17,00:18:59.17,"BUT IF I HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOES,"
458,00:19:01.04,00:19:01.04,I WOULD HAVE SPENT IT WITH MY MOM.
459,00:19:02.33,00:19:02.33,">> MIKE, I'M GLAD I DIDN'T WIN"
460,00:19:04.29,00:19:04.29,BECAUSE I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
461,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,I MEAN--
462,00:19:07.17,00:19:07.17,>> THE WAY THEY TREATED ME--
463,00:19:08.88,00:19:08.88,">> YEAH, I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, ME, TOO."
464,00:19:10.83,00:19:10.83,>> I WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IT TO THEM.
465,00:19:12.21,00:19:12.21,>> I ASKED GOD TO HELP ME WIN
466,00:19:14.83,00:19:14.83,AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE ASKED OF ME.
467,00:19:17.96,00:19:17.96,THE DECISION I MADE TODAY WAS NOT A STRATEGIC ONE.
468,00:19:21.29,00:19:21.29,IT WASN'T TO EARN THE GOOD GRACES
469,00:19:22.96,00:19:22.96,OF THE OMETEPE TRIBE.
470,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,IT WAS JUST THE RIGHT DECISION TO MAKE
471,00:19:25.38,00:19:25.38,AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
472,00:19:26.71,00:19:26.71,IF I MAKE IT DEEP INTO THIS GAME
473,00:19:29.29,00:19:29.29,"AND IT EARNS ME A VOTE OR TWO ON THE JURY,"
474,00:19:32.33,00:19:32.33,THEN THAT WILL BE A GREAT BONUS.
475,00:19:35.04,00:19:35.04,"I'M SORRY, GUYS."
476,00:19:36.17,00:19:36.17,">> NO, NO, DON'T BE SORRY."
477,00:19:37.88,00:19:37.88,"MAN, THAT'S MORE THAN I'VE DONE"
478,00:19:39.58,00:19:39.58,"THE WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN OUT HERE,"
479,00:19:41.00,00:19:41.00,"JUST THAT ONE MOMENT, YOU KNOW."
480,00:19:44.92,00:19:44.92,>> I FEEL BAD FOR MATT
