193,00:12:01.47,00:12:01.47,PETE THINKS HE HAS A PIECE FOR THE BLUE TEAM.

203,00:12:27.60,00:12:27.60,PICK IT UP! JEFF STARTING WORK ON THE EIGHTH
204,00:12:32.27,00:12:32.27,PIECE. YELLOW TEAM THINKS THEY HAVE IT.
205,00:12:35.20,00:12:35.20,AND THEY DO! (SCREAMINGING)
206,00:12:38.67,00:12:38.67,"YELLOW TEAM WINS REWARD! YELLOW TEAM, NICE JOB."
207,00:12:48.50,00:12:48.50,"AFTERNOON PICNIC, A LITTLE CRUISE THROUGH THE JUNGLE."

210,00:12:54.17,00:12:54.17,FEEL LIKE I'M HOME FOR A LITTLE BIT.

216,00:13:39.37,00:13:39.37,EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. >> I'M NOT IN THE GAME.
217,00:13:45.00,00:13:45.00,"OH, MAN, I WANTED THAT REWARD. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE, I'M OUT"
218,00:13:48.37,00:13:48.37,HERE FOR A MILLION DOLLARS. I'M STILL IN THE GAME.
219,00:13:51.23,00:13:51.23,"I'VE BEEN EATING BEANS AND RICE FOR 21 DAYS, BEANS AND RICE FOR"

224,00:14:11.50,00:14:11.50,"ALLIANCE, TOO. YOU KNOW, GOING WITH PENNER."
225,00:14:18.30,00:14:18.30,"AND THERE IS NO, LIKE, PLACEMENT, REALLY."
226,00:14:22.53,00:14:22.53,"I REALLY DO THINK THAT WAY. >> YOU GUYS ARE UP THERE,"
227,00:14:25.63,00:14:25.63,THOUGH. THAT JUST MAKES SENSE.
228,00:14:27.97,00:14:27.97,"ABI'S GOT A BIG MOUTH AND WHEN ABI NEED INFORMATION, THAT'S"
229,00:14:31.17,00:14:31.17,VERY DANGEROUS. SO IT'S LIKE THE PUPPY YOU HAVE
230,00:14:33.63,00:14:33.63,TO TAKE CARE OF. SO THIS IS WHAT I'M THINKING.
231,00:14:37.10,00:14:37.10,WE HAVE TANDANG NOW. EVERYTHING'S JUST A FREE RIDE TO
232,00:14:40.20,00:14:40.20,HOME. SO I'M THINKING WE HAVE TO GET
233,00:14:42.30,00:14:42.30,RID OF KALABAW. SO WE -- THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
234,00:14:45.97,00:14:45.97,"PENNER NOW, RIGHT? AND THEN THEY WANT TO GET RID OF"
235,00:14:48.63,00:14:48.63,SKUPIN NEXT. BUT WHAT IF WE GET RID OF
236,00:14:52.10,00:14:52.10,"PENNER, KEEP SKUPIN AROUND FOR A WHILE, TAKE OUT JEFF, TAKE OUT"
237,00:14:56.40,00:14:56.40,"DENICE, THEN TAKE OUT MALCOLM AND THEN VOTE OUT SKUPIN."
238,00:15:00.17,00:15:00.17,>> OKAY. I WANT JEFF GONE.
239,00:15:01.87,00:15:01.87,I THINK HE'S FORMING AN ALLIANCE WITH LISA.
240,00:15:04.10,00:15:04.10,EVEN THOUGH YOU THINK I'M (BLEEP) AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE
241,00:15:06.50,00:15:06.50,ME. >> WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO DO
242,00:15:08.87,00:15:08.87,"THAT? ACTUALLY, STUFF PISSES YOU OFF,"
243,00:15:10.70,00:15:10.70,THAT PISSES ME OFF. STOP THAT.
244,00:15:13.23,00:15:13.23,ABI'S IMMATURE. SHE THINKS EVERYBODY'S OUT TO
245,00:15:14.93,00:15:14.93,GET HER AND I WISH I COULD VOTE HER OUT BUT I KNOW IF SHE'S IN
246,00:15:18.77,00:15:18.77,THE FINAL THREE SHE'S NOT GETTING ANY VOTE.
247,00:15:23.67,00:15:23.67,>> SHOULD WE GET A LITTLE DRINK AND A TOAST?
248,00:15:25.90,00:15:25.90,>> YES. >> LET'S DO A TOAST.
249,00:15:29.73,00:15:29.73,HERE'S TO AN INCREDIBLE PULLOFF. AWESOME TEAM WORK.
250,00:15:32.60,00:15:32.60,">> GREAT ALL THE WAY AROUND. >> HEY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT."
251,00:15:35.63,00:15:35.63,">> LICK IT OFF! >> OH, YOU GUYS."
252,00:15:39.37,00:15:39.37,"ON THE REWARD, IT WAS A GREAT GROUP."
253,00:15:41.27,00:15:41.27,WE GOT TO GO DOWN THE RIVER AND JUST EAT.
254,00:15:43.57,00:15:43.57,">> JUST A FEW RIBS, GUYS. >> I DON'T KNOW THE IF THERE'S"
255,00:15:47.30,00:15:47.30,ENOUGH. >> I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
256,00:15:49.40,00:15:49.40,>> LET'S JUST SAVOR BITE AFTER BITE.
257,00:15:51.80,00:15:51.80,THAT'S WHO I WOULD HAVE WANTED TO HAVE BEEN AT THAT REWARD WITH
258,00:15:53.97,00:15:53.97,BECAUSE THEY'RE A POSITIVE GROUP THAT HAS MESHED TOGETHER WELL.
259,00:15:56.70,00:15:56.70,IT WAS NICE TO BE WITH THEM. I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR THOSE GUYS
260,00:15:59.90,00:15:59.90,BACK AT CAMP BUT I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THIS.
261,00:16:02.77,00:16:02.77,>> UH-HUH. >> I REALLY AM.
262,00:16:04.07,00:16:04.07,">> I FEEL BADLY FOR SKUPIN, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE ONES THAT"
263,00:16:07.07,00:16:07.07,"ARE BACK THERE, THEY FIND SOMETHING TO BE UPSET ABOUT"
264,00:16:09.47,00:16:09.47,AFTER EVERY CHALLENGE. >> IT'S LIKE THERE'S JUST
265,00:16:12.27,00:16:12.27,"NEGATIVITY, YEAH. THERE IS A BIT OF A GOOD VERSUS"
266,00:16:15.47,00:16:15.47,EVIL DYNAMIC THE TRIBE RIGHT NOW.

271,00:16:29.50,00:16:29.50,LITTLE BEHINDS. >> I HATE THAT KIND OF BULLYING
272,00:16:32.30,00:16:32.30,AND THAT KIND OF DESPOTIC -- LIKE A TYRANT.
273,00:16:37.10,00:16:37.10,>> IT'S SOMETHING PENNER IS TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO TURN
274,00:16:39.80,00:16:39.80,THE VOTE AGAINST ONE OF THE FLY INSTEAD OF HIMSELF.
275,00:16:41.87,00:16:41.87,>> I HONESTLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN WIN THE GAME AT THIS
276,00:16:45.47,00:16:45.47,POINT. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANY OF
277,00:16:46.83,00:16:46.83,THE FOUR OF YOU OR CARTER BE THERE.
278,00:16:49.70,00:16:49.70,>> IT'S EASY FOR ME WHO'S GOT MY HEAD ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TO
279,00:16:52.67,00:16:52.67,SAY YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A MOVE. BUT I'M SAYING IT.
280,00:16:57.87,00:16:57.87,AND IF IT CAN HELP SAVE ME FOR ONE MORE VOTE I'D APPRECIATE IT
281,00:17:01.30,00:17:01.30,AND I THINK I CAN HELP YOU GUYS GET IN CONTROL OF THE GAME.

284,00:17:10.03,00:17:10.03,"HONESTLY, THERE MUST BE A WAY TO DIFFUSE THAT AND SAY WE CAN'T"
285,00:17:13.10,00:17:13.10,"LIVE IN A CAMP WITH TYRANNICAL BULLIES, IT'S JUST NOT COOL."
286,00:17:16.47,00:17:16.47,>> CERTAINLY THE IDEA OF BATTLING IT OUT AT THE END WITH
287,00:17:20.60,00:17:20.60,FOUR OTHER WORTHY OPPONENTS IS SUCH A NOBLE CHOICE.
288,00:17:25.23,00:17:25.23,BUT I'M DISCOVERING THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO JUST GET TO THE FINAL
289,00:17:29.17,00:17:29.17,"FIVE. I'M TRYING TO WIN, WHICH MEANS I"
290,00:17:30.97,00:17:30.97,NEED TO FIRST GET TO THE FINAL THREE WITH AS MANY PEOPLE THAT
291,00:17:35.30,00:17:35.30,AREN'T GOING TO GET MORE VOTES THAN ME AS POSSIBLE.
292,00:17:37.63,00:17:37.63,"I MEAN, THAT'S JUST HOW YOU GET AHEAD."
293,00:17:40.10,00:17:40.10,"THE SAME RULES DON'T APPLY IN THE GAME OF ""SURVIVOR"" AS THEY"

295,00:18:16.73,00:18:16.73,GOING TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THIS IS THE TIME TO DO A 5-4
296,00:18:20.10,00:18:20.10,ALLIANCE. IT MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE FOR ME
297,00:18:23.17,00:18:23.17,AND SKUPIN TO GO TO THE END WITH ABI AND ARTIS AND PETE BECAUSE
298,00:18:27.07,00:18:27.07,THEY HAVE MADE SO MANY ENEMIES AND MADE SO MANY HOT HEAD
299,00:18:31.70,00:18:31.70,EMOTIONAL MOVES THAT HAVE TICKED PEOPLE OFF.
300,00:18:33.70,00:18:33.70,">> PENNER, I GOT A PRETTY GOOD CLAM."

304,00:18:51.83,00:18:51.83,UNIVERSE. I WANT TO TELL YOU MY PLAN.
305,00:18:56.23,00:18:56.23,I'LL LOOK YOU IN THE EYES AND I HAVE NOT TOLD ANYBODY THIS PLAN.
306,00:18:58.97,00:18:58.97,YOU KNOW PENNER NOW AND THEN EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD FOR YOU
307,00:19:05.13,00:19:05.13,NEXT. BUT MALCOLM HAS THE HIDDEN
308,00:19:07.17,00:19:07.17,IMMUNITY IDOL. >> WOW.
309,00:19:09.70,00:19:09.70,>> AND NOBODY KNOWS IT EXCEPT MALCOLM AND DENICE AND ME.
310,00:19:12.97,00:19:12.97,HE HASN'T TOLD ANYBODY ELSE. AFTER PENNER WE'VE GOT TO GET
311,00:19:15.67,00:19:15.67,PETE ON THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE YOU.
312,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,5-4. TANDANG HAS TO HANG TOGETHER AND
313,00:19:22.87,00:19:22.87,BLIND SIDE MALCOLM. >> LISA IS NOW IN THIS GAME TO
314,00:19:26.47,00:19:26.47,WIN IT. WHICH IS GREAT.
315,00:19:28.07,00:19:28.07,BECAUSE SHE'S MY CLOSEST ALLY OUT HERE.
316,00:19:33.57,00:19:33.57,WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT IF PENNER WINS IMMUNITY?
317,00:19:36.40,00:19:36.40,>> I THINK -- I THINK -- COME IN.
318,00:19:42.17,00:19:42.17,WE'RE HAVING A VERY HEATED DISCUSSION AND IT'S ALL ABOUT
319,00:19:45.33,00:19:45.33,YOU. >> HOT DISCUSSION?
320,00:19:46.33,00:19:46.33,">> A HEATED AND HOT DISCUSSION. >> I DIDN'T MEAN TO BREAK IT UP,"

326,00:20:07.37,00:20:07.37,>> A LOT WILL DEPEND ON WHO WINS IMMUNITY.
327,00:20:10.07,00:20:10.07,THE ONLY WAY TO BE SAFE IS TO WIN IT.
328,00:20:11.77,00:20:11.77,AND SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A DOG FIGHT OUT THERE TODAY.
329,00:20:14.90,00:20:14.90,>> I'VE NEVER WON AN INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.
330,00:20:18.50,00:20:18.50,NEVER ONCE. SO MAYBE -- MAYBE IT'S HIGH TIME

549,00:33:49.13,00:33:49.13,"SO SKUPIN, THE MINUTE PENNER WINS IMMUNITY DOES THAT POINT"
550,00:33:52.97,00:33:52.97,THE FINGER THEN AT YOU? >> I FELT A LOT OF PRESSURE
551,00:33:56.13,00:33:56.13,"INSTANTLY. BUT WHEN I CAME BACK TO CAMP, IT"
552,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF THE PRESSURE OFF WHEN I HEARD SOME
553,00:34:01.30,00:34:01.30,PEOPLE TALKING. (LAUGHS)
554,00:34:06.70,00:34:06.70,>> Jeff: MALCOLM? >> I PUT MY FAITH IN A LITTLE
555,00:34:09.40,00:34:09.40,TEXAS GIRL AND SHE THREW ME UNDER THE BUS PRETTY HARD TODAY.

557,00:34:16.30,00:34:16.30,>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE. IT WAS GOING TO BE AN EASY VOTE
558,00:34:20.57,00:34:20.57,UNTIL PENNER WON IMMUNITY. BACKUP PLAN WAS MICHAEL.
559,00:34:26.10,00:34:26.10,BUT MICHAEL HAS BEEN THE STRONG MEMBER OF THE TANDANG TRIBE FROM
560,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,THE VERY BEGINNING SO WHY NOT ELIMINATE WHOM I THOUGHT WAS THE
561,00:34:32.53,00:34:32.53,BIGGEST THREAT IN THE GAME-- WHICH WOULD BE MALCOLM.
562,00:34:36.67,00:34:36.67,">> Jeff: SO IF WE JUST LOOK AT IT FROM HERE, THERE'S THE"
563,00:34:40.63,00:34:40.63,"TANDANG FIVE-- LISA, ABI, PETE, SKUPIN, AND ARTIS-- AND THEN"

567,00:34:54.47,00:34:54.47,FIFTH RIGHT THERE AND WE'RE SQUARE UP 5-5 AGAIN?
568,00:34:57.70,00:34:57.70,>> ABSOLUTELY. EVERY CRACK IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

570,00:35:04.10,00:35:04.10,FIND OUT THAT ONE OF YOUR TRIBE MEMBERS JUST SCREW IT HAD WHOLE
571,00:35:07.73,00:35:07.73,"GAME UP. >> YES, AND I ALWAYS FELT THAT"
572,00:35:10.33,00:35:10.33,MALCOLM WAS A PART OF US SO I AM IN AWE RIGHT NOW.
573,00:35:13.07,00:35:13.07,I THINK THIS IS REALLY LUDICROUS.
574,00:35:15.73,00:35:15.73,>> BUT YOU WERE WILLING FOR MICHAEL TO GO HOME WHO WAS PART
575,00:35:18.10,00:35:18.10,OF THE TANDANG TRIBE ORIGINALLY. >> BUT MICHAEL AND R.C. WAS

577,00:35:27.57,00:35:27.57,ARTIS. AND MALCOLM WAS ALWAYS PART OF
578,00:35:29.13,00:35:29.13,OUR ALLIANCE AS WELL. >> BUT YOU JUST --
579,00:35:31.97,00:35:31.97,>> Jeff: IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE FOR THAT ONE ABI.
580,00:35:34.40,00:35:34.40,>> I THINK THAT WAS A MISTAKE. I'M SORRY.
581,00:35:36.77,00:35:36.77,MALCOLM WAS WAY STRONGER IN OUR ALLIANCE THAN SKUPIN EVER WAS.
582,00:35:40.23,00:35:40.23,>> BUT IF SOMEBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL YOU TRY TO FLUSH
583,00:35:43.83,00:35:43.83,IT OUT OR TRUE TRY TO BLIND SAID THEM BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE THREAT

585,00:35:50.10,00:35:50.10,SAYING MALCOLM HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU KNOW IT?
586,00:35:54.17,00:35:54.17,>> YES. AND I DID BRING THAT INFORMATION
587,00:35:56.07,00:35:56.07,TO MAKE THE TANDANG TRIBE STRONGER.
588,00:35:58.10,00:35:58.10,"I WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES, BUT MY ALLEGIANCE WAS TO THE ORIGINAL"
589,00:36:04.37,00:36:04.37,ALLIANCE. >> Jeff: OH.

604,00:36:55.70,00:36:55.70,IT LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE SIX OF US RIGHT HERE WHO CAN MARCH
605,00:36:58.67,00:36:58.67,FORWARD IN THIS GAME. THAT MEANS KEEPING SKUPIN AND I
606,00:37:01.37,00:37:01.37,"IN THAT SIX, AT LEAST FOR A WHILE."
607,00:37:03.50,00:37:03.50,YOU GUYS READY TO DO THAT? >> WE'VE DISCUSSED THOSE OPTIONS

615,00:37:27.27,00:37:27.27,AND HOPEFULLY THIS PROVES I AM LOYAL ENOUGH TO TAKE THE
616,00:37:31.87,00:37:31.87,OFFENSIVE MOVE FOR US TO SECURE THE NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO ARE IN
617,00:37:35.70,00:37:35.70,OUR CORE ALLIANCE. >> Jeff: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
618,00:37:38.50,00:37:38.50,"THERE ARE TWO PITCHES: LISA'S SAYING PLA PLAN ""B""--"
619,00:37:43.33,00:37:43.33,INVOLVES ONE OF THOSE SIX. PENNER'S SAYING LET'S TAKE THE

636,00:39:37.00,00:39:37.00,NOW IS MOST DEFINITELY THE TIME TO DO SO.

638,00:39:59.07,00:39:59.07,THE DECISION IS FINAL. PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
