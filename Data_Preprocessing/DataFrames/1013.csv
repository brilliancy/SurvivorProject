3,00:00:06.29,00:00:06.29,">> PROBST: After Janu shocked her tribe by quitting the game,"
4,00:00:09.25,00:00:09.25,Koror's plan to oust Stephenie was out in the open.
5,00:00:12.12,00:00:12.12,>> STEPHENIE: I don't know who to trust.
6,00:00:14.12,00:00:14.12,I don't know who to talk to. I almost don't want to talk
7,00:00:16.08,00:00:16.08,to anybody. >> PROBST: But Stephenie's
8,00:00:17.42,00:00:17.42,presence in the game put the men on edge.
9,00:00:19.12,00:00:19.12,>> Stephenie progressing in this game means that Koror
10,00:00:21.42,00:00:21.42,falls apart. >> PROBST: Tom was also feeling
11,00:00:23.46,00:00:23.46,vulnerable. >> I'm pleading for my life.
12,00:00:26.08,00:00:26.08,"My strength in the challenges, it's part of what got us to"
13,00:00:29.29,00:00:29.29,this point. >> PROBST: But the women saw
14,00:00:31.75,00:00:31.75,an opportunity and a plan was hatched.
15,00:00:35.67,00:00:35.67,>> I think it's an awesome idea. >> Who would be the first one
16,00:00:37.67,00:00:37.67,you'd want off? >> You want to think I'm
17,00:00:40.67,00:00:40.67,a threat? I'll show you how threatening
18,00:00:42.67,00:00:42.67,I am. >> PROBST: Before the immunity
19,00:00:44.96,00:00:44.96,"challenge, Tom turned to Caryn. >> I think that we do have some"
20,00:00:48.25,00:00:48.25,kind of a sympathetic thing going where we're going to
21,00:00:51.25,00:00:51.25,look out for each other. It was a good move on my part
22,00:00:53.75,00:00:53.75,to be friends with Caryn. >> PROBST: At the immunity
23,00:00:57.08,00:00:57.08,"challenge, the pressure was on. There are five tiles for"
24,00:01:00.71,00:01:00.71,each of you. First person to break all five
25,00:01:03.46,00:01:03.46,of their tiles wins immunity. But Ian was handed victory
26,00:01:06.42,00:01:06.42,when Tom took out his last tile. Ian wins immunity.
27,00:01:12.12,00:01:12.12,">> Thank you, guys. >> PROBST: Back at camp,"
28,00:01:15.12,00:01:15.12,Katie approached Caryn about the women's alliance.
29,00:01:19.25,00:01:19.25,Stick with the women and take out the men?
30,00:01:21.04,00:01:21.04,>> PROBST: Caryn leaked the information.
31,00:01:23.21,00:01:23.21,>> What do the girls think? >> Trying to figure out
32,00:01:26.46,00:01:26.46,which side to take out. >> PROBST: So Ian confronted
33,00:01:32.12,00:01:32.12,Katie when he learned of her plan.
34,00:01:34.12,00:01:34.12,>> Caryn is spreading that you're trying to get all the
35,00:01:36.08,00:01:36.08,girls against the guys. >> I just hate for it to be such
36,00:01:38.08,00:01:38.08,a sweep and Tom just takes the whole thing and none of
37,00:01:40.08,00:01:40.08,us have a chance. >> PROBST: All hope for the
38,00:01:42.08,00:01:42.08,women's alliance was crushed... It's already been too much
39,00:01:44.08,00:01:44.08,of the Stephenie show. Stephenie needs to go.
40,00:01:46.08,00:01:46.08,Too much of the Stephenie show. Stephenie needs to go.
41,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,>> PROBST: But Steph still clung to hope.
42,00:01:50.08,00:01:50.08,">> I've said my piece, I planted my seed."
43,00:01:52.08,00:01:52.08,"If they're smart, Tom will be the next one to go."
44,00:01:54.08,00:01:54.08,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, although Caryn received one"
45,00:01:57.50,00:01:57.50,"vote, Koror stuck together. The third member of our jury,"
46,00:02:00.67,00:02:00.67,"Steph. And Stephenie, the only"
47,00:02:03.00,00:02:03.00,"remaining Ulong member, was finally voted out."
48,00:02:06.12,00:02:06.12,The tribe has spoken. Six are left.
49,00:02:10.29,00:02:10.29,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
50,00:02:50.08,00:02:50.08,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa (man groaning)
51,00:03:41.17,00:03:41.17,>> Poor girl. Did you see her face?
52,00:03:43.79,00:03:43.79,She was probably stressing out. >> It was horrible. I know.
53,00:03:46.92,00:03:46.92,>> I felt bad. >> Stephenie was the one
54,00:03:49.67,00:03:49.67,voted off. I thought that it could
55,00:03:51.67,00:03:51.67,have been me last night. I wouldn't blame them.
56,00:03:53.92,00:03:53.92,"If I was playing against me, I'd want me out of here, too,"
57,00:03:56.50,00:03:56.50,but they didn't do it; it was a relief.
58,00:03:59.62,00:03:59.62,"They're holding true to the five, and would I like to"
59,00:04:02.08,00:04:02.08,believe that it will continue to do that.
60,00:04:10.88,00:04:10.88,>> Everything's good; everything's good.
61,00:04:12.33,00:04:12.33,>> I'm going to tell you I've been trying to think of
62,00:04:14.33,00:04:14.33,different things. I'm up all night running
63,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,"scenarios. >> Me, too."
64,00:04:17.88,00:04:17.88,>> Caryn and I spoke on the way to tree mail.
65,00:04:21.79,00:04:21.79,She's more nervous than a long- tailed cat in a roomful of
66,00:04:24.67,00:04:24.67,"rocking chairs, at this point. She knows that she's outside"
67,00:04:29.04,00:04:29.04,"of an alliance of five, so she feels she's next."
68,00:04:31.71,00:04:31.71,I can't step out from five to side with one right now.
69,00:04:36.33,00:04:36.33,>> Uh-huh. >> And what you've got to do
70,00:04:39.25,00:04:39.25,is pull your own savior; your salvation.
71,00:04:50.92,00:04:50.92,>> I've been telling Tom and Ian that Gregg and Jenn need to be
72,00:04:56.17,00:04:56.17,"split, and he said he knew that, but that he could not turn"
73,00:05:00.12,00:05:00.12,"against the five people that he had the alliance with, so..."
74,00:05:04.04,00:05:04.04,"I am definitely the most vulnerable of the six remaining,"
75,00:05:06.29,00:05:06.29,no question about it. I'm just hoping and praying
76,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,"that something happens. Otherwise, I'm going home."
77,00:05:12.21,00:05:12.21,">> Scamper, scamper, scamper. We got tree mail."
78,00:05:14.50,00:05:14.50,">> We're up, we're up, we're up. >> ""Care for a bit of R&R?"
79,00:05:18.46,00:05:18.46,"To be pampered would be nice."" >> ALL: Oh!"

86,00:05:42.50,00:05:42.50,>> I know. >> Everybody wants this.
87,00:05:47.92,00:05:47.92,">> Katie and I promised each other, if we won a challenge,"
88,00:05:49.96,00:05:49.96,"we'd take each other if we have the ability, and that's what"
89,00:05:52.29,00:05:52.29,"we're gonna today do. >> Oh, my God. Oh, God."
90,00:05:55.25,00:05:55.25,"I'm fighting hard for this one. >> Me, too."
91,00:06:05.62,00:06:05.62,>> PROBST: Come on in! We are down to six.
92,00:06:12.46,00:06:12.46,"For today's reward challenge, I'm going to ask you a series"
93,00:06:15.58,00:06:15.58,of questions about Palau and Micronesia.

97,00:06:28.38,00:06:28.38,goes in the water; they're out of the challenge.
98,00:06:31.17,00:06:31.17,"Last person left standing, wins reward."
99,00:06:33.71,00:06:33.71,Want to know what you're playing for?
100,00:06:35.08,00:06:35.08,">> Oh, yeah. >> Yeah."

191,00:11:04.12,00:11:04.12,">> Is that horrible if I hit you, Jenn?"
192,00:11:06.25,00:11:06.25,"You'll never live it down, ever. >> PROBST: Wait, Gregg."
193,00:11:09.29,00:11:09.29,>> Yeah. Did you just ask permission?
194,00:11:11.25,00:11:11.25,">> Yes, he did. >> Wow."
195,00:11:13.04,00:11:13.04,">> Is it okay, dear? >> What a..."
196,00:11:14.50,00:11:14.50,">> Gregg, be a man. >> Don't do it, Gregg."
197,00:11:16.50,00:11:16.50,>> I can't believe you're doing that.
198,00:11:18.12,00:11:18.12,">> You said, ""I'll save you."" >> If you hit me, she's going"
199,00:11:20.08,00:11:20.08,"to hit me, too, I'll be out. >> PROBST: Wow."
200,00:11:23.33,00:11:23.33,">> You suck, Gregg. >> PROBST: Gregg hits Katie."
201,00:11:25.79,00:11:25.79,"Katie comes back and hits Gregg, and no smile on that face."
202,00:11:31.08,00:11:31.08,Interesting how that works. Jenn is now in the lead.
203,00:11:33.71,00:11:33.71,Gregg and Katie down to their last drop.
204,00:11:36.33,00:11:36.33,Jenn still has two hits. True or false...
205,00:11:38.79,00:11:38.79,"""Palau was the first nation in the world to issue the Elvis"

207,00:11:48.96,00:11:48.96,"Gregg got it right, Jenn got it right."
208,00:11:50.62,00:11:50.62,"Katie got it wrong. Jenn, you're up."
209,00:11:52.79,00:11:52.79,">> Sorry, Katie. >> Don't."
210,00:11:54.83,00:11:54.83,>> I'm sorry. >> PROBST: Katie is out of the
211,00:11:59.54,00:11:59.54,"competition, takes a seat on the bench."
212,00:12:02.00,00:12:02.00,Gregg's only choice is Jenn. >> At least he didn't ask.
213,00:12:07.25,00:12:07.25,>> PROBST: You both have one hit left.
214,00:12:09.50,00:12:09.50,"One person gets it right, and the other person gets it wrong,"
215,00:12:12.25,00:12:12.25,"that's it. ""The coconut crabs which inhabit"

221,00:12:33.71,00:12:33.71,">> PROBST: Gregg says ""A) change That is right."
222,00:12:37.50,00:12:37.50,"Gregg, make your final hit. Gregg has no choice."
223,00:12:39.96,00:12:39.96,">> Oh, damn. >> Sorry, Jenn."
224,00:12:41.54,00:12:41.54,">> PROBST: Takes Jenn, puts her out of the challenge."
225,00:12:44.25,00:12:44.25,Gregg wins reward. >> Sorry.
226,00:12:45.88,00:12:45.88,">> Good job, Gregg. >> PROBST: Yacht, shower..."
227,00:12:50.04,00:12:50.04,">> Sorry. >> PROBST: ...massage,"
228,00:12:52.04,00:12:52.04,big feast. Obviously it wouldn't be much
229,00:12:53.92,00:12:53.92,fun alone. >> Oh!
230,00:12:55.62,00:12:55.62,"So pick one person to join you. >> Sorry, guys."
231,00:13:03.29,00:13:03.29,"Jenn, let's go. >> Oh!"
232,00:13:05.21,00:13:05.21,Thank you. >> Ooh...
233,00:13:11.17,00:13:11.17,>> PROBST: I'm sure you guys will have a good time together.
234,00:13:14.04,00:13:14.04,"And two is very fun, but three is a party."
235,00:13:16.12,00:13:16.12,"Pick one more person. >> Oh, God!"
236,00:13:18.25,00:13:18.25,">> Oh! >> Sorry, man."
237,00:13:21.42,00:13:21.42,>> Katie. (cheering)
238,00:13:25.46,00:13:25.46,">> You are forgiven. >> Hey, guys, I'm so sorry."
239,00:13:29.17,00:13:29.17,"I will, uh... I will pay you back."
240,00:13:31.04,00:13:31.04,">> Oh, no, we'll pay you back. (laughing)"
241,00:13:34.50,00:13:34.50,">> PROBST: Tom, Ian, Caryn, head on back to camp."
242,00:13:38.17,00:13:38.17,"All right, guys, your yacht is waiting."
243,00:13:39.71,00:13:39.71,Have a good night. That's the icing on the cake.
244,00:13:57.00,00:13:57.00,We didn't come here for the icing.
245,00:13:58.58,00:13:58.58,We came for the cake. Let's go talk.
246,00:14:00.79,00:14:00.79,I have an idea. >> You do?
247,00:14:02.33,00:14:02.33,>> Yeah. >> Really?
248,00:14:03.67,00:14:03.67,">> Yeah. >> I'm serious about it, yeah."
249,00:14:04.75,00:14:04.75,">> Today at the challenge, Katie chose to throw me into the water"
250,00:14:08.08,00:14:08.08,"rather than Gregg, and I said, ""Wow, that's interesting."
251,00:14:11.25,00:14:11.25,"If Katie is willing to sell me out for a night on the yacht,"
252,00:14:13.75,00:14:13.75,there's no way she's going to hold on to me for a million
253,00:14:16.25,00:14:16.25,"dollars."" We have a couple choices to"
254,00:14:18.00,00:14:18.00,"make. >> Okay, go."
255,00:14:20.25,00:14:20.25,">> The way that I see it right now, we have lost control of"
256,00:14:23.79,00:14:23.79,the game. >> Why?
257,00:14:25.29,00:14:25.29,>> We're not making the decisions.
258,00:14:26.96,00:14:26.96,"Gregg and Jenn are. >> Why, 'cause they won one"
259,00:14:29.25,00:14:29.25,"challenge? >> No, uh-uh."
260,00:14:30.83,00:14:30.83,"I think that they got Katie, and one of the three of us out."
261,00:14:33.17,00:14:33.17,"Me, Tom, you. >> Mm-hmm."
262,00:14:36.58,00:14:36.58,>> I think it goes in that order.
263,00:14:38.50,00:14:38.50,I know they're ready to turn on you.
264,00:14:40.33,00:14:40.33,I know for a fact. >> And you think Katie is in
265,00:14:43.12,00:14:43.12,"with that? >> Yeah, I think she is."
266,00:14:44.71,00:14:44.71,">> Caryn warned me that Katie was looking to get rid of me,"
267,00:14:48.08,00:14:48.08,but I still wasn't willing to take her word over Katie's at
268,00:14:51.08,00:14:51.08,"that point. Now, Ian says Katie, she's now"
269,00:14:54.50,00:14:54.50,"become the shady lady Katie, looking to dump us and go into"
270,00:14:58.25,00:14:58.25,the final with Gregg and Jenn. >> I think Gregg is a dark horse
271,00:15:00.25,00:15:00.25,right now. >> Yeah.
272,00:15:02.25,00:15:02.25,>> Nobody would vote against him in the final two.
273,00:15:04.25,00:15:04.25,>> Nobody. Especially... >> Why?
274,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,">> He's never made any enemies. >> He hasn't pissed anybody off,"
275,00:15:08.17,00:15:08.17,he's very affable. He works hard.
276,00:15:11.12,00:15:11.12,>> What do you think? >> We go for Gregg tomorrow
277,00:15:16.04,00:15:16.04,night. >> Do we?
278,00:15:20.21,00:15:20.21,">> We'd tie, wouldn't we? >> Yeah."
279,00:15:23.21,00:15:23.21,"Three would go against me, and three would go against"
280,00:15:25.46,00:15:25.46,Gregg. What more do you propose?
281,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,>> I don't know what the next step is.
282,00:15:32.12,00:15:32.12,">> Suddenly, the sequence of events have fallen into place"
283,00:15:36.00,00:15:36.00,"that have really benefited me. Those five had an alliance,"
284,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,"and, lucky for me, that alliance is breaking down now."
285,00:15:42.25,00:15:42.25,I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen.
286,00:15:45.58,00:15:45.58,The only thing I can do is to keep close to Tom and Ian.
287,00:15:48.29,00:15:48.29,That's all I can do. That's my only hope.
288,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,">> Gregg, you got to go on first."
289,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,">> This is awesome. >> Oh, my God."
290,00:16:02.75,00:16:02.75,>> We get to the boat and Captain Mike greets us and lets
291,00:16:06.67,00:16:06.67,"us know this is a day of being pampered, VIP treatment."
292,00:16:10.33,00:16:10.33,">> Rooms one and two. >> Oh, my gosh."
293,00:16:13.88,00:16:13.88,>> He shows us to the bunks and when we walked in we found
294,00:16:16.17,00:16:16.17,our bathing suits which we haven't seen since we left
295,00:16:18.46,00:16:18.46,for the island. (shouting)
296,00:16:21.04,00:16:21.04,We were so excited to get on to the next event.
297,00:16:24.62,00:16:24.62,"So we quickly scrubbed up, threw the bathrobe on and then we went"
298,00:16:27.29,00:16:27.29,up to the deck for full-body massages.
299,00:16:30.04,00:16:30.04,It felt like finally I was on vacation in Palau.
300,00:16:41.04,00:16:41.04,(whispers indistinctly) That feels great.
301,00:16:46.88,00:16:46.88,"This is unbelievable. I'm sitting there loving it,"
302,00:16:50.83,00:16:50.83,"just relaxing, and then I noticed the hands feel a little"
303,00:16:54.25,00:16:54.25,"colder, feel a little different. Next thing I know I get a hard"
304,00:16:59.21,00:16:59.21,"smack on the ass, and I do a double take."
305,00:17:02.79,00:17:02.79,"My eyes have been closed, I've been daydreaming."
306,00:17:05.50,00:17:05.50,"And my best friend from home, Greg, is staring at me, and he's"
307,00:17:08.08,00:17:08.08,"like what's up? >> Looking fine, dude."
308,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,">> Doing well, man. >> Yeah, hell, yeah."
309,00:17:12.04,00:17:12.04,>> We were both in disbelief. >> It was nuts.
310,00:17:14.12,00:17:14.12,We didn't know how to react. >> Cheers.
311,00:17:16.08,00:17:16.08,>> I don't even know where to begin.
312,00:17:17.42,00:17:17.42,">> Cheers. >> Oh, my God, what's this?"
313,00:17:19.50,00:17:19.50,"What?! Oh, my God."
314,00:17:22.54,00:17:22.54,>> Shrimp and... >> What is this?
315,00:17:25.25,00:17:25.25,">> Dig in, man. >> This is an onion ring."
316,00:17:26.92,00:17:26.92,>> This is beautiful. >> Calamari.
317,00:17:28.79,00:17:28.79,">> This is, by far, the best reward challenge,"
318,00:17:31.00,00:17:31.00,"I mean, obviously. >> Oh, my God!"
319,00:17:34.21,00:17:34.21,">> Oh, my God! >> You got... you got all the"
320,00:17:42.79,00:17:42.79,"stuff? >> All of a sudden, I get a tap"
321,00:17:46.83,00:17:46.83,"on my shoulder, and it's my sister Kim."
322,00:17:48.83,00:17:48.83,"All I could do was bawl, like cry."
323,00:17:50.67,00:17:50.67,"That's all I could do. I was just like, oh, my God."
324,00:17:52.67,00:17:52.67,She's here! >> We're going to have a party!
325,00:17:56.83,00:17:56.83,>> Stan is my sister's husband. He is the brother I never had.
326,00:18:00.79,00:18:00.79,"My sister just had a baby, so she wasn't able to come,"
327,00:18:04.00,00:18:04.00,so it was the next-best thing to having my sister.
328,00:18:06.29,00:18:06.29,I couldn't ask for a better reward.
329,00:18:09.04,00:18:09.04,>> It was the most phenomenal experience of my lifetime.
330,00:18:26.62,00:18:26.62,>> Now they're doing it. >> But you're sure that she's
331,00:18:28.62,00:18:28.62,ready to go against me with them?
332,00:18:30.75,00:18:30.75,">> Yep. >> Mm-hmm, I know that."
333,00:18:33.21,00:18:33.21,>> So Gregg should go tomorrow? >> Mm-hmm.
334,00:18:42.46,00:18:42.46,>> It would be very easy in a tie situation.
335,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,You put Gregg and Caryn up against the wall.
336,00:18:46.62,00:18:46.62,>> And so we need to break this tie.
337,00:18:48.83,00:18:48.83,">> Katie is forced to switch her vote, because she knows that"
338,00:18:51.67,00:18:51.67,"if she doesn't, she has to pick a rock."
339,00:18:53.67,00:18:53.67,">> Right. >> The way the rules are, if"
340,00:18:55.83,00:18:55.83,"there is a tie at Tribal Council, both members who were"
341,00:18:59.33,00:18:59.33,"voted on, those two will become safe and it comes down to the"
342,00:19:03.33,00:19:03.33,"rest of us, reaching in a bag, pulling out a colored stone."
343,00:19:07.25,00:19:07.25,Whoever gets the purple stone is going home that night.
344,00:19:10.83,00:19:10.83,That's a calculated risk on our part.
345,00:19:12.83,00:19:12.83,>> Maybe she picks the rock and then we have to pick a rock
346,00:19:15.04,00:19:15.04,"to see who goes home. It sucks, but I can go to Tribal"
347,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,"Council willing to take the rock, you know what I mean?"
348,00:19:20.62,00:19:20.62,"Like, I'm willing to make that gamble."
349,00:19:22.62,00:19:22.62,I came to play a game. >> That's the plan.
350,00:19:26.12,00:19:26.12,>> You and I are both willing to choose rocks.
351,00:19:28.25,00:19:28.25,>> And we should be. >> That's right.
352,00:19:33.67,00:19:33.67,Let's do this. >> Desperate times call for
353,00:19:35.96,00:19:35.96,"desperate measures, right? >> We have a plan."
354,00:19:39.21,00:19:39.21,>> Tom and I have decided that we're going to force a tie
355,00:19:41.46,00:19:41.46,at Tribal Council. We've prepared ourselves for the
356,00:19:44.25,00:19:44.25,"idea that we might be going home, but this is a risk we"
357,00:19:46.50,00:19:46.50,had to take. >> It's a gamble.
358,00:19:48.50,00:19:48.50,"Hopefully, Katie realizes that she doesn't want to pick a rock."
359,00:19:51.46,00:19:51.46,She wants to stay in the game. This is the biggest step that
360,00:19:53.92,00:19:53.92,you and I have to get to the final three.
361,00:19:55.83,00:19:55.83,That's why it's important that he does not see it coming.
362,00:19:57.58,00:19:57.58,Any leaks and we're done. The game's over for us.
363,00:20:00.75,00:20:00.75,It's a delicate operation that needs to be handled with the
364,00:20:02.88,00:20:02.88,utmost of care. It's kind of like taking a bag
365,00:20:05.29,00:20:05.29,"of potato chips from a fat man. You can do it, but you'd better"
366,00:20:08.00,00:20:08.00,"do it quick. Otherwise, he'll turn around"
367,00:20:09.88,00:20:09.88,and sit on you. >> You've been acting the last
368,00:20:11.88,00:20:11.88,two days like you're about to be sent home.
369,00:20:13.96,00:20:13.96,>> Uh-huh. >> Continue to act that way.
370,00:20:16.04,00:20:16.04,>> Okay. >> Do not say a word...
371,00:20:17.83,00:20:17.83,> Don't be chipper. Be down and dour.
372,00:20:20.33,00:20:20.33,>> Okay. >> Okay.
373,00:20:21.29,00:20:21.29,>> Okay? >> Yep.
374,00:20:22.38,00:20:22.38,I can do it. I'm psyched.
375,00:20:25.12,00:20:25.12,I'm totally psyched. This is really working out well.
376,00:20:27.17,00:20:27.17,"I think we can pull this off, I really do."
377,00:20:29.88,00:20:29.88,"Because you know what? I'm a very good actress,"
378,00:20:31.75,00:20:31.75,"very, very good. >> This is so gorgeous."
379,00:20:44.08,00:20:44.08,We're on a boat going to this lagoon.
380,00:20:45.96,00:20:45.96,"We're just thinking snorkeling, we have no idea."
381,00:20:48.25,00:20:48.25,">> I don't know. >> Oh, my gosh, there's"
382,00:20:51.25,00:20:51.25,"dolphins! >> All of a sudden, all of us"
383,00:20:54.58,00:20:54.58,see these fins that are just swimming through the water and
384,00:20:59.08,00:20:59.08,"we're like oh, my God, no way, no way!"
385,00:21:08.58,00:21:08.58,>> Hi. >> Hi.
386,00:21:15.25,00:21:15.25,">> Oh, my gosh. >> Swimming with the dolphins"
387,00:21:20.04,00:21:20.04,"was, by far, the most magical moment I've ever had."
388,00:21:23.71,00:21:23.71,It was something I've always wanted to do.
389,00:21:25.29,00:21:25.29,"I mean, it's like my dream. >> Hi!"
390,00:21:27.67,00:21:27.67,">> Oh, this is... >> Oh!"
391,00:21:28.67,00:21:28.67,>> I'm so happy. >> It was the most surreal
392,00:21:31.54,00:21:31.54,"experience I've ever had, and to be able to share that"
393,00:21:33.83,00:21:33.83,with my sister was just incredible.
394,00:21:35.88,00:21:35.88,"I kept going, ""I can't believe you're here for this."""
395,00:21:39.50,00:21:39.50,"It's just the experience of a lifetime, and she got to"
396,00:21:42.38,00:21:42.38,share it with me. I never wanted it to end.
397,00:21:45.21,00:21:45.21,It was unbelievable. >> Cheers. I can't reach.
398,00:21:56.21,00:21:56.21,">> After the day of snorkeling, and hanging with the dolphins,"
399,00:21:59.21,00:21:59.21,we were able to do a little strategy talk.
400,00:22:01.08,00:22:01.08,"This was our opportunity to confirm that, hey, guys,"
401,00:22:03.50,00:22:03.50,it's us three to the final three.
402,00:22:06.50,00:22:06.50,"We happen to have a good bond, and it just also benefits"
403,00:22:09.79,00:22:09.79,the three of us to go to the final three.
404,00:22:19.21,00:22:19.21,">> I came into this knowing that I might have to jump ship, if"
405,00:22:22.08,00:22:22.08,it comes down to it. My strategy is to stick with
406,00:22:24.33,00:22:24.33,those people that make the decisions until those people no
407,00:22:27.08,00:22:27.08,"longer have any power, and then jump to the next person that"
408,00:22:29.08,00:22:29.08,makes the decision. >> Yeah.
409,00:22:43.21,00:22:43.21,">> We all realize the threats that Ian and Tom are, so it was"
410,00:22:46.33,00:22:46.33,good to get agreement with that. It felt real.
411,00:22:48.25,00:22:48.25,It felt true. And I believe that that bond
412,00:22:50.71,00:22:50.71,is-is tight till the end. >> I hear a boat.
413,00:23:03.08,00:23:03.08,">> I think it's them. >> Oh, yeah."
414,00:23:05.54,00:23:05.54,">> Here we go, guys. >> Let's do this right."
415,00:23:08.71,00:23:08.71,">> I'm sour and dour. >> Hey, hey!"
416,00:23:12.38,00:23:12.38,>> What's happening? >> Who's that?
417,00:23:16.25,00:23:16.25,>> I don't know. >> That's their families.
418,00:23:19.46,00:23:19.46,">> Oh, no. >> Oh, no."
419,00:23:20.92,00:23:20.92,">> Oh, no. >> Those are your families."
420,00:23:22.67,00:23:22.67,"Today I think my worst fears were, uh... realized."
421,00:23:27.54,00:23:27.54,Only three family members got to spend time with their loved
422,00:23:31.62,00:23:31.62,"ones, and the other three are left on the beach to, uh, hear"
423,00:23:35.75,00:23:35.75,the stories. >> How you doing? I'm Tom.
424,00:23:37.92,00:23:37.92,">> This one cuts and twists, and, uh, it's tough."
425,00:23:41.42,00:23:41.42,>> We're almost there. >> I know.
426,00:23:43.04,00:23:43.04,>> We'll plow through. >> Yeah.
427,00:23:44.46,00:23:44.46,">> Get-Get this thing done. >> It'll get tough, you know,"
428,00:23:46.75,00:23:46.75,when you guys get down to picking people that you care
429,00:23:48.71,00:23:48.71,about off. >> Sure.
430,00:23:50.54,00:23:50.54,">> Well, if there's one person that, uh..."
431,00:23:52.42,00:23:52.42,">> You've got somebody looking out for her out here, it's me"
432,00:23:54.79,00:23:54.79,"looking out for her, so... >> Good."
433,00:23:56.12,00:23:56.12,I appreciate that. >> When my friend Greg had to
434,00:24:04.58,00:24:04.58,"leave, it was just really tough. >> Remember, we're all proud"
435,00:24:09.38,00:24:09.38,"of you at home. >> You know, it was only a year"
436,00:24:11.83,00:24:11.83,"ago that my dad passed away, and the grieving still happens"
437,00:24:13.83,00:24:13.83,every day. Just tell my mom that I love
438,00:24:17.04,00:24:17.04,her so much and I cannot wait to just spend time with her
439,00:24:19.88,00:24:19.88,when I get back. Will you tell her that?
440,00:24:22.38,00:24:22.38,>> I will. >> Just tell her...
441,00:24:29.42,00:24:29.42,>> This might have been the last love fest in camp.
442,00:24:32.92,00:24:32.92,>> Let's do a really cheesy... (indistinct voices)
443,00:24:36.29,00:24:36.29,">> Now it's time to get control of the game again, and focus on"
444,00:24:40.79,00:24:40.79,the coming six days and what needs to be accomplished.
445,00:24:44.75,00:24:44.75,"It has been a good run, but it's about to get a little rough."
446,00:24:49.12,00:24:49.12,That little trip that they took may cost them big.
447,00:25:02.42,00:25:02.42,>> Tree mail. >> What have we got?
448,00:25:08.54,00:25:08.54,">> ""Some played hard, some just watched and others just"
449,00:25:12.04,00:25:12.04,skated by. To make your chances one

454,00:25:25.29,00:25:25.29,>> What? >> Wow.
455,00:25:27.62,00:25:27.62,">> In order for our plan to work, a lot has to happen today."
456,00:25:31.04,00:25:31.04,"Worst case scenario is Gregg wins immunity, so we really"
457,00:25:33.58,00:25:33.58,need to work hard today and make sure that doesn't happen.
458,00:25:35.62,00:25:35.62,I didn't come to play for sixth or fifth or fourth or third or
459,00:25:37.62,00:25:37.62,second. I'm going to do my damndest
460,00:25:41.04,00:25:41.04,to make sure that I come across the finish line first.
461,00:25:48.38,00:25:48.38,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! How's it going, everybody?"
462,00:25:54.04,00:25:54.04,">> Hey, Jeff. >> PROBST: Ready to get to"
463,00:25:57.04,00:25:57.04,today's immunity challenge? >> Yeah.

465,00:26:00.83,00:26:00.83,Ian... give it up. Immunity once again back up
466,00:26:08.38,00:26:08.38,for grabs. It is rare in this game
467,00:26:10.54,00:26:10.54,of Survivor that you get a second chance.
468,00:26:13.04,00:26:13.04,Today's challenge provides just that-- a second chance to
469,00:26:15.96,00:26:15.96,revisit some of the challenges from the past.
470,00:26:18.12,00:26:18.12,It is a Survivor elimination-style challenge.
471,00:26:22.25,00:26:22.25,All six of you will race up the net maze.

473,00:26:28.58,00:26:28.58,you will race to a symbol-- a land version of the sea star
474,00:26:32.04,00:26:32.04,puzzle. The first four to finish that
475,00:26:34.50,00:26:34.50,"will move on to the next round, where you will eat three balut,"
476,00:26:38.17,00:26:38.17,a partially-developed duck egg. The first three to get the balut
477,00:26:42.17,00:26:42.17,"down the quickest move on to the next round, where you will race"
478,00:26:46.08,00:26:46.08,"to untie a box, retrieve a flag, string it up the flag pole."
479,00:26:49.75,00:26:49.75,The first two to finish that move on to the last round.
480,00:26:53.42,00:26:53.42,The last two Survivors will compete in a head-to-head
481,00:26:57.08,00:26:57.08,shooting competition. The first Survivor to knock
482,00:27:00.08,00:27:00.08,out their three targets wins immunity.
483,00:27:01.67,00:27:01.67,"Take your spots, get started. All right, for immunity, first"
484,00:27:09.58,00:27:09.58,five to finish move on to the next round.

493,00:27:50.21,00:27:50.21,Moving on to the next round. This is what you're trying to
494,00:27:53.21,00:27:53.21,solve. First four to finish their sea
495,00:27:56.08,00:27:56.08,star puzzle move on to the next round.

539,00:30:50.58,00:30:50.58,>> PROBST: Ian takes his aim. Ian connects with his first
540,00:30:56.17,00:30:56.17,target. He's up one-oh.
541,00:30:58.25,00:30:58.25,Tom looking to even the score. Tom misses.
542,00:31:06.17,00:31:06.17,Ian leads one-oh. Ian looking to extend the lead.

546,00:31:20.08,00:31:20.08,"Tom, still not on the board. All Ian has to do is knock"
547,00:31:24.12,00:31:24.12,out his last blue target. And he does.
548,00:31:29.04,00:31:29.04,>> Whoo! >> Wow.
549,00:31:30.58,00:31:30.58,>> PROBST: Ian wins immunity. >> Nice job. Good shooting.

554,00:31:43.75,00:31:43.75,not the same for you. One of you is going home
555,00:31:46.04,00:31:46.04,tonight. Should be a fun afternoon
556,00:31:47.79,00:31:47.79,back at camp. I'll see you at Tribal Council
557,00:31:49.58,00:31:49.58,tonight. Head on back.
558,00:32:09.67,00:32:09.67,>> I remember the jungle course being a lot easier on day three.

560,00:32:16.88,00:32:16.88,"That darn gun, man, that is my Achilles heel."
561,00:32:19.42,00:32:19.42,"It's very fortunate I became a fireman rather than a cop,"
562,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,because it would just be dangerous for everybody.
563,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,"Well, that's okay. 'Cause you know what?"
564,00:32:29.21,00:32:29.21,"I was going five, you were going four, so rightfully so, I should"
565,00:32:32.25,00:32:32.25,be the one taking the risk. We've got a plan in place.
566,00:32:36.08,00:32:36.08,"Ian and I are gonna pretend that there's nothing going on,"
567,00:32:38.29,00:32:38.29,everything is fine. But the three of us--
568,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,"myself, Ian and Caryn-- will vote for Gregg tonight,"
569,00:32:44.67,00:32:44.67,"the other three will vote for Caryn, and then we'll"
570,00:32:47.21,00:32:47.21,go to a draw and be forced to pick a stone.
571,00:32:49.46,00:32:49.46,But it won't be Ian who has to choose-- he won immunity.
572,00:32:52.58,00:32:52.58,"It'll be me. So I'm very vulnerable, but it's"
573,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,better to play it hard and go home tonight than to sit around
574,00:32:58.96,00:32:58.96,here and just wait to be eliminated by their threesome.
575,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,">> So, we're good with the immunity today."
576,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,We needed Caryn not to get it. >> Yeah. We should all be pretty
577,00:33:07.33,00:33:07.33,"proud of the fact we looked around and said, ""Hey, five"
578,00:33:09.96,00:33:09.96,"of us."" >> Right."
579,00:33:11.12,00:33:11.12,>> Yeah. >> We're there.
580,00:33:13.71,00:33:13.71,I was a little nervous stepping away from the game for
581,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,"a while, so it was comforting to come back and get no"
582,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,mysterious looks or no... people trying to connive.
583,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,"So, I can say with a lot of confidence that Caryn will be"
584,00:33:26.46,00:33:26.46,"going home tonight. I mean, you could tell, she's"
585,00:33:29.04,00:33:29.04,"just out of commission today. >> Caryn's in a Janu place, huh?"
586,00:33:32.96,00:33:32.96,">> Yeah. >> Well, that's what happens"
587,00:33:35.62,00:33:35.62,when you know you're done. >> Caryn is winning an Academy
588,00:33:39.46,00:33:39.46,"Award right now. She is lying in the hut, down"
589,00:33:42.50,00:33:42.50,"and sour, like she thinks she's going home."
590,00:33:44.88,00:33:44.88,Perfect. Just the way we told her to.
591,00:33:47.04,00:33:47.04,"So, this should be a total surprise tonight."
592,00:33:50.46,00:33:50.46,>> I think so. >> Interesting or...
593,00:33:56.71,00:33:56.71,>> No. Just it's gonna be... >> It's always interesting.
594,00:34:00.12,00:34:00.12,>> Yeah. >> I'll start getting some
595,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,firewood. >> All right.
596,00:34:16.96,00:34:16.96,>> I just feel so rejuvenated. >> Yeah.
597,00:34:19.21,00:34:19.21,">> We have a good advantage. The next one, though, is the"
598,00:34:22.54,00:34:22.54,"big one. >> It's big, yeah."
599,00:34:25.21,00:34:25.21,">> Yeah. Oh, exactly."
600,00:34:31.96,00:34:31.96,>> Things going okay? >> Yeah. Yeah.
601,00:34:35.08,00:34:35.08,>> Good. Good. >> I was just thinking today
602,00:34:37.04,00:34:37.04,"a lot about family, and I just wanted to talk to you about it."
603,00:34:39.83,00:34:39.83,"I told Stan right before he left, uh, I was gonna watch"
604,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,over you. >> Aw...
605,00:34:43.62,00:34:43.62,>> And that I was gonna protect you.
606,00:34:45.38,00:34:45.38,>> That's still the deal for me. >> Good.
607,00:34:47.42,00:34:47.42,>> There's only two people in this game that I've made
608,00:34:50.17,00:34:50.17,"promises to; Tom's one, Katie's the other-- I told Katie I"
609,00:34:52.92,00:34:52.92,"wouldn't write her name down, and I told her brother-in-law"
610,00:34:55.75,00:34:55.75,"I had her back, and that means a lot to me, so..."
611,00:34:58.21,00:34:58.21,I'm gonna stay true to that. What I wanted to talk to you
612,00:35:00.62,00:35:00.62,"about was, we're gonna flip it tonight."
613,00:35:02.42,00:35:02.42,>> Yeah. >> What do you mean?
614,00:35:04.96,00:35:04.96,">> Um, Caryn and Tom, um, and I are gonna vote for Gregg."
615,00:35:08.04,00:35:08.04,>> Yeah. >> What?!
616,00:35:10.46,00:35:10.46,">> Yeah, we're flipping the game around."
617,00:35:21.46,00:35:21.46,"We're gonna force a tie, unless you vote Gregg."
618,00:35:24.29,00:35:24.29,">> If it's a tie, then what happens?"
619,00:35:26.21,00:35:26.21,">> It goes to rocks. You know, that's why I wanted to"
620,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,"give you the heads-up. >> Ian pulled me aside, like,"
621,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,right before we went to Tribal Council with the idea of taking
622,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,out Gregg. I had some issues with it.
623,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50,"I'm, like, you know it's really unfair for you just to come in"
624,00:35:39.00,00:35:39.00,"and say, this is what we're doing, this is what the plan is."
625,00:35:41.17,00:35:41.17,"Think about it-- for you and Tom, that's great."
626,00:35:43.46,00:35:43.46,"But I'm just thinking as far as I'm concerned, I was"
627,00:35:45.58,00:35:45.58,in a good place. >> I know that you're playing
628,00:35:47.58,00:35:47.58,"the game, and I know that you don't want to take me to the"
629,00:35:49.50,00:35:49.50,"finals because you're afraid... >> 'Cause I wouldn't win, Ian."
630,00:35:51.67,00:35:51.67,">> Katie, if you and I go up against each other, it's gonna"
631,00:35:53.88,00:35:53.88,be a lot closer than you think. >> That's such crap.
632,00:36:00.25,00:36:00.25,">> He's, like, ""Do I have a reason to feel paranoid?"""
633,00:36:02.50,00:36:02.50,"I'm, like, I don't think so. >> No. I mean, that goes without"
634,00:36:06.04,00:36:06.04,"saying, right? >> I just don't want you to get"
635,00:36:08.96,00:36:08.96,dumped. I'd rather see you in the final
636,00:36:11.08,00:36:11.08,two with me. >> Right.
637,00:36:12.67,00:36:12.67,The reason Ian wants me with him in the end is so he'll win.
638,00:36:16.17,00:36:16.17,Tom wants the same thing. >> I'm ready to go.
639,00:36:19.62,00:36:19.62,">> When it comes down to it, I'm gonna have to make a"
640,00:36:22.38,00:36:22.38,decision so I can have a better chance of winning.
641,00:36:25.25,00:36:25.25,I'm here to win a million dollars just like anyone else.
642,00:36:49.17,00:36:49.17,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the members of the jury.
643,00:36:51.38,00:36:51.38,"Coby, Janu... and Steph, voted out"
644,00:36:55.54,00:36:55.54,at the last Tribal Council. Let's talk about the reward
645,00:37:03.12,00:37:03.12,"challenge. This late in the game, they can"
646,00:37:06.08,00:37:06.08,be good news/bad news. You don't want to be away from
647,00:37:08.54,00:37:08.54,"camp and miss the politics. On the other hand, if you don't"
648,00:37:11.17,00:37:11.17,"win, you might miss out on something fantastic, like a"
649,00:37:14.00,00:37:14.00,surprise visit from the loved ones.
650,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,"Gregg, did it turn out to be a good thing?"
651,00:37:18.08,00:37:18.08,">> Yeah, it turned out to be a great experience."
652,00:37:20.96,00:37:20.96,"But on the other side of the coin, it-it did hurt to know"
653,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,"that I was leaving behind three tribe members, and they"
654,00:37:27.21,00:37:27.21,"didn't get to share in the opportunity, so, you know, it's"
655,00:37:30.25,00:37:30.25,a tough situation to be in. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
656,00:37:33.38,00:37:33.38,the reward challenge itself. It is designed to bring out
657,00:37:37.12,00:37:37.12,"the status of a tribe. Caryn, you were first out."
658,00:37:40.79,00:37:40.79,"Yeah, that was very hard. >> For some reason, they felt"
659,00:37:44.00,00:37:44.00,I had too many rewards. And I didn't feel I had won that
660,00:37:46.42,00:37:46.42,"much, but, you know, there was obviously some resentment about"
661,00:37:49.25,00:37:49.25,"that, 'cause my torch went out like that."
662,00:37:51.17,00:37:51.17,">> PROBST: Do you think that's all it was, you had a little"
663,00:37:53.08,00:37:53.08,"more food, nothing else? >> I do think so."
664,00:37:55.04,00:37:55.04,>> Yes. >> PROBST: How can it not have
665,00:37:57.21,00:37:57.21,more implications than just food when you watch Gregg ask Jenn
666,00:38:01.58,00:38:01.58,for permission about what to do? (laughter)
667,00:38:05.50,00:38:05.50,You guys are laughing; I'm serious.
668,00:38:07.46,00:38:07.46,We're down to the nitty-gritty here for a million bucks.
669,00:38:09.83,00:38:09.83,"Jenn, you're clearly seen as somewhat of a couple with Gregg."
670,00:38:15.25,00:38:15.25,Are you at all worried that that's going to hurt you at some
671,00:38:18.04,00:38:18.04,"point in this big, happy family? >> I do worry about that"
672,00:38:20.96,00:38:20.96,"a little bit. Um, but I do think that we're"
673,00:38:23.08,00:38:23.08,both playing a very individual game.
674,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,>> I think people know that Jenn and I do have a bond and a
675,00:38:28.75,00:38:28.75,"relationship, and, you know, it wasn't malicious or even"
676,00:38:32.12,00:38:32.12,strategic for me to want to spend some time with her.
677,00:38:35.04,00:38:35.04,"But that's not gonna have people turn against each other or, you"
678,00:38:38.17,00:38:38.17,"know, change your strategy for just one day away."
679,00:38:40.21,00:38:40.21,">> PROBST: Caryn, back to you. You were first out."
680,00:38:43.79,00:38:43.79,You brought more than anybody tonight.
681,00:38:45.46,00:38:45.46,It looks like you brought everything you have.
682,00:38:47.46,00:38:47.46,>> I've been carrying my stuff to every Tribal Council.
683,00:38:49.50,00:38:49.50,"Janu, Willard, Coby and I were not part of the five-person"
684,00:38:53.83,00:38:53.83,alliance. So...
685,00:38:56.08,00:38:56.08,"I always feel vulnerable. >> PROBST: Tom, it's now down"
686,00:38:59.83,00:38:59.83,to six people who have been together from day one.
687,00:39:02.38,00:39:02.38,Has it changed how you think about voting somebody out?
688,00:39:06.04,00:39:06.04,Because you're gonna hurt somebody.
689,00:39:08.17,00:39:08.17,"Somebody's going home tonight, and they're moving right over"
690,00:39:10.58,00:39:10.58,there. >> Right.
691,00:39:11.79,00:39:11.79,"We are friends, and we are looking to slit each other's"
692,00:39:14.88,00:39:14.88,throats at night. I think that right  now you do
693,00:39:17.79,00:39:17.79,"have an ""all is fair in love and war"" attitude that's all"
694,00:39:21.38,00:39:21.38,about advancing your move down the board.
695,00:39:24.21,00:39:24.21,">> PROBST: All right, Ian, once again, you have the"
696,00:39:27.29,00:39:27.29,immunity necklace. It is yours to keep or give up
697,00:39:29.54,00:39:29.54,"to somebody else. >> Um, I think I'll hold"
698,00:39:31.58,00:39:31.58,"on to it tonight. >> PROBST: With that, it is time"
699,00:39:33.42,00:39:33.42,"to vote. Tom, you're up."
700,00:39:52.17,00:39:52.17,">> Gregg, you're the dark horse. And it's just time for the"
701,00:39:55.83,00:39:55.83,dark horse to ride off into the sunset.
702,00:40:26.50,00:40:26.50,"I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the"
703,00:40:42.04,00:40:42.04,decision is final-- person voted out will be asked to leave the
704,00:40:45.04,00:40:45.04,Tribal Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
705,00:40:49.33,00:40:49.33,First vote. Caryn.
706,00:40:56.12,00:40:56.12,"Caryn. Two votes Caryn. Gregg. Two votes Caryn,"
707,00:41:03.08,00:41:03.08,"one vote Gregg. Gregg. Two votes Caryn,"
708,00:41:10.08,00:41:10.08,"two votes Gregg. Gregg. That's three votes Gregg,"
709,00:41:17.58,00:41:17.58,two votes Caryn. I'll read the last vote.
710,00:41:23.12,00:41:23.12,13th person voted out of Survivor: Palau and the
711,00:41:25.96,00:41:25.96,fourth member of our jury... Gregg.
712,00:41:28.04,00:41:28.04,>> You guys are good. >> PROBST: You need to bring me
713,00:41:30.92,00:41:30.92,"your torch. Gregg, the tribe has spoken."
714,00:41:45.08,00:41:45.08,"It's time for you to go. Well, the message seems clear--"
715,00:41:59.08,00:41:59.08,"with six days left, nobody's safe anymore."
716,00:42:01.21,00:42:01.21,Grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.
717,00:42:19.25,00:42:19.25,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
718,00:42:24.12,00:42:24.12,>> PROBST: Next time on... Survivor.
719,00:42:27.21,00:42:27.21,>> I don't really have a deal with Tom.
720,00:42:28.79,00:42:28.79,>> We know you have a deal with Tom.
721,00:42:30.42,00:42:30.42,>> PROBST: The women compare notes.
722,00:42:32.17,00:42:32.17,>> Katie just cleaned house. >> PROBST: And Ian and Katie
723,00:42:34.00,00:42:34.00,have a blow-out. >> You said you would never
724,00:42:35.75,00:42:35.75,"lie to me, and you did. >> Damn!"
725,00:42:37.17,00:42:37.17,>> You didn't even think about how that was gonna make me feel
726,00:42:40.12,00:42:40.12,to have you go against your word.
727,00:42:41.46,00:42:41.46,">> You want me to step out? I mean, I'll do it. I'll do it."
728,00:42:49.58,00:42:49.58,>> I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely
729,00:42:51.58,00:42:51.58,"surprised. My hat's off to 'em, though."
730,00:42:54.00,00:42:54.00,"They got me, they got me good. Um, I learned a lot of things."
731,00:42:57.67,00:42:57.67,An experience is nothing unless you share it with other people
732,00:43:00.54,00:43:00.54,"who you love. Jenn, best of luck."
733,00:43:02.79,00:43:02.79,"I appreciate your friendship out on the island, and, uh, look"
734,00:43:07.17,00:43:07.17,forward to... hanging out soon.
