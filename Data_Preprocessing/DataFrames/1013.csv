271,00:15:02.25,00:15:02.25,>> Nobody would vote against himin the final two.

283,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,"and, lucky for me, that allianceis breaking down now."
284,00:15:42.25,00:15:42.25,I'm not sure exactly what'sgoing to happen.
285,00:15:45.58,00:15:45.58,The only thing I can do isto keep close to Tom and Ian.
286,00:15:48.29,00:15:48.29,That's all I can do.That's my only hope.
287,00:15:59.17,00:15:59.17,">> Gregg, you got to go onfirst."
288,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,">> This is awesome.>> Oh, my God."

295,00:16:21.04,00:16:21.04,We were so excited to get onto the next event.
296,00:16:24.62,00:16:24.62,"So we quickly scrubbed up, threwthe bathrobe on and then we went"
297,00:16:27.29,00:16:27.29,up to the deck for full-bodymassages.
298,00:16:30.04,00:16:30.04,It felt like finally I was onvacation in Palau.
299,00:16:41.04,00:16:41.04,(whispers indistinctly)That feels great.
300,00:16:46.88,00:16:46.88,"This is unbelievable.I'm sitting there loving it,"

326,00:18:04.00,00:18:04.00,so it was the next-best thingto having my sister.
327,00:18:06.29,00:18:06.29,I couldn't ask for a betterreward.
328,00:18:09.04,00:18:09.04,>> It was the most phenomenalexperience of my lifetime.
329,00:18:26.62,00:18:26.62,>> Now they're doing it.>> But you're sure that she's
330,00:18:28.62,00:18:28.62,ready to go against me withthem?

334,00:18:44.21,00:18:44.21,You put Gregg and Caryn upagainst the wall.
335,00:18:46.62,00:18:46.62,>> And so we need to break thistie.
336,00:18:48.83,00:18:48.83,">> Katie is forced to switchher vote, because she knows that"

342,00:19:07.25,00:19:07.25,Whoever gets the purple stoneis going home that night.
343,00:19:10.83,00:19:10.83,That's a calculated riskon our part.
344,00:19:12.83,00:19:12.83,>> Maybe she picks the rock andthen we have to pick a rock
345,00:19:15.04,00:19:15.04,"to see who goes home.It sucks, but I can go to Tribal"

347,00:19:20.62,00:19:20.62,"Like, I'm willing to makethat gamble."
348,00:19:22.62,00:19:22.62,I came to play a game.>> That's the plan.
349,00:19:26.12,00:19:26.12,>> You and I are both willingto choose rocks.
350,00:19:28.25,00:19:28.25,>> And we should be.>> That's right.

356,00:19:46.50,00:19:46.50,had to take.>> It's a gamble.
357,00:19:48.50,00:19:48.50,"Hopefully, Katie realizes thatshe doesn't want to pick a rock."
358,00:19:51.46,00:19:51.46,She wants to stay in the game.This is the biggest step that
359,00:19:53.92,00:19:53.92,you and I have to get to thefinal three.
360,00:19:55.83,00:19:55.83,That's why it's important thathe does not see it coming.
361,00:19:57.58,00:19:57.58,Any leaks and we're done.The game's over for us.
362,00:20:00.75,00:20:00.75,It's a delicate operation thatneeds to be handled with the
363,00:20:02.88,00:20:02.88,utmost of care.It's kind of like taking a bag
364,00:20:05.29,00:20:05.29,"of potato chips from a fat man.You can do it, but you'd better"
365,00:20:08.00,00:20:08.00,"do it quick.Otherwise, he'll turn around"
366,00:20:09.88,00:20:09.88,and sit on you.>> You've been acting the last

563,00:32:29.21,00:32:29.21,"I was going five, you were goingfour, so rightfully so, I should"
564,00:32:32.25,00:32:32.25,be the one taking the risk.We've got a plan in place.
565,00:32:36.08,00:32:36.08,"Ian and I are gonna pretend thatthere's nothing going on,"
566,00:32:38.29,00:32:38.29,everything is fine.But the three of us--
567,00:32:41.21,00:32:41.21,"myself, Ian and Caryn--will vote for Gregg tonight,"
568,00:32:44.67,00:32:44.67,"the other three will votefor Caryn, and then we'll"
569,00:32:47.21,00:32:47.21,go to a draw and be forcedto pick a stone.
570,00:32:49.46,00:32:49.46,But it won't be Ian who hasto choose-- he won immunity.
571,00:32:52.58,00:32:52.58,"It'll be me.So I'm very vulnerable, but it's"
572,00:32:55.50,00:32:55.50,better to play it hard and gohome tonight than to sit around
573,00:32:58.96,00:32:58.96,here and just wait to beeliminated by their threesome.
574,00:33:02.00,00:33:02.00,">> So, we're good with theimmunity today."
575,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,We needed Caryn not to get it.>> Yeah. We should all be pretty
576,00:33:07.33,00:33:07.33,"proud of the fact we lookedaround and said, ""Hey, five"
577,00:33:09.96,00:33:09.96,"of us."">> Right."
578,00:33:11.12,00:33:11.12,>> Yeah.>> We're there.
579,00:33:13.71,00:33:13.71,I was a little nervousstepping away from the game for
580,00:33:17.08,00:33:17.08,"a while, so it was comfortingto come back and get no"
581,00:33:19.21,00:33:19.21,mysterious looks or no...people trying to connive.
582,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,"So, I can say with a lot ofconfidence that Caryn will be"
583,00:33:26.46,00:33:26.46,"going home tonight.I mean, you could tell, she's"
584,00:33:29.04,00:33:29.04,"just out of commission today.>> Caryn's in a Janu place, huh?"
585,00:33:32.96,00:33:32.96,">> Yeah.>> Well, that's what happens"
586,00:33:35.62,00:33:35.62,when you know you're done.>> Caryn is winning an Academy

590,00:33:47.04,00:33:47.04,"So, this should be a totalsurprise tonight."
591,00:33:50.46,00:33:50.46,>> I think so.>> Interesting or...
592,00:33:56.71,00:33:56.71,>> No. Just it's gonna be...>> It's always interesting.
593,00:34:00.12,00:34:00.12,>> Yeah.>> I'll start getting some
594,00:34:03.17,00:34:03.17,firewood.>> All right.

603,00:34:42.21,00:34:42.21,over you.>> Aw...
604,00:34:43.62,00:34:43.62,>> And that I was gonnaprotect you.
605,00:34:45.38,00:34:45.38,>> That's still the deal for me.>> Good.
606,00:34:47.42,00:34:47.42,>> There's only two people inthis game that I've made

608,00:34:52.92,00:34:52.92,"wouldn't write her name down,and I told her brother-in-law"
609,00:34:55.75,00:34:55.75,"I had her back, and that meansa lot to me, so..."

618,00:35:26.21,00:35:26.21,">> It goes to rocks.You know, that's why I wanted to"
619,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,"give you the heads-up.>> Ian pulled me aside, like,"
620,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,right before we went to TribalCouncil with the idea of taking
621,00:35:34.17,00:35:34.17,out Gregg.I had some issues with it.
622,00:35:36.50,00:35:36.50,"I'm, like, you know it's reallyunfair for you just to come in"
623,00:35:39.00,00:35:39.00,"and say, this is what we'redoing, this is what the plan is."

625,00:35:43.46,00:35:43.46,"But I'm just thinking asfar as I'm concerned, I was"
