1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: We are flying
2,00:00:11.75,00:00:11.75,"over the stunning water of the Fiji Islands, a place once known"
3,00:00:15.08,00:00:15.08,"for its cannibalism, uncharted reefs, and formidable warriors."
4,00:00:20.79,00:00:20.79,"These islands are home to spectacular sea life and lush,"
5,00:00:24.62,00:00:24.62,jagged terrain. Just below are 19 strangers
6,00:00:32.21,00:00:32.21,"that represent an extreme cross-section of America, from a"
7,00:00:36.71,00:00:36.71,former homeless street performer to a Harvard-educated lawyer.
8,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00,They have been given absolutely no information.
9,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,The fear of the unknown is so strong that one survivor quit
10,00:00:47.75,00:00:47.75,just moments before being set adrift miles from shore.
11,00:00:52.25,00:00:52.25,"Exile Island is back, with hundreds of deadly sea snakes."
12,00:00:58.00,00:00:58.00,"And this time, two hidden immunity idols will complicate"
13,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00,"the game like never before. 39 days, 19 people, one"
14,00:01:09.58,00:01:09.58,"survivor. >> When I got there, I noticed"
15,00:01:24.58,00:01:24.58,"we were, like, all 19 of us together."
16,00:01:27.92,00:01:27.92,I thought that Jeff was going to be there and we were going to
17,00:01:29.71,00:01:29.71,"be, like, split into tribes, and ""You go this way and you go the"
18,00:01:31.12,00:01:31.12,"other way."" But it wasn't the case."
19,00:01:47.17,00:01:47.17,">> In my past, where I used to work and stuff, they called me"
20,00:01:49.12,00:01:49.12,Stallone. They called me... I guess I look
21,00:01:51.17,00:01:51.17,like Sylvester Stallone or Rocky.
22,00:01:53.00,00:01:53.00,"I have droopy eyes, dark hair. For some reason James was too"
23,00:01:55.71,00:01:55.71,"hard for them to remember, so Rocky will suffice."
24,00:02:05.00,00:02:05.00,">> We were just so excited to get here, it didn't matter what"
25,00:02:07.17,00:02:07.17,we were doing. We were lost on a deserted
26,00:02:09.54,00:02:09.54,"island, you know? What would anybody do?"
27,00:02:12.29,00:02:12.29,"Go explore. >> Oh, it's water!"
28,00:02:14.75,00:02:14.75,">> Yeah, water! >> Water!"
29,00:02:19.38,00:02:19.38,>> Where? >> Filled my canteen.
30,00:02:23.00,00:02:23.00,"I'll tell you right now, I lost my mind."
31,00:02:24.92,00:02:24.92,"I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to say."
32,00:02:26.71,00:02:26.71,I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off.
33,00:02:34.58,00:02:34.58,">> We look, and there's this big, beautiful cave."
34,00:02:36.38,00:02:36.38,"We're like, ""This is a blessing. We're like, ""We're great."""
35,00:02:38.50,00:02:38.50,>> I found a lemon tree. >> We've got banana trees over
36,00:02:40.96,00:02:40.96,there. We've got papaya over there.
37,00:02:43.17,00:02:43.17,"We are stoked. >> Well, my real name is Andre."
38,00:02:49.71,00:02:49.71,But on this beach I go by Dreamz.
39,00:02:57.21,00:02:57.21,I came up with the name Dreamz a long time ago.
40,00:02:59.58,00:02:59.58,It was more of a name of striving and achievement.
41,00:03:03.38,00:03:03.38,">> I'm glad we came up here. Now, look at this."
42,00:03:06.88,00:03:06.88,"It's like buying a new house. You know, you want to see"
43,00:03:09.96,00:03:09.96,"everything-- the backyard, the front yard, living room, the"
44,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,dining room. You want to see everything
45,00:03:14.88,00:03:14.88,that's in your house. And this is our house.
46,00:03:17.25,00:03:17.25,"I'm the king of Fiji, of an unnamed island."
47,00:03:28.12,00:03:28.12,>> My outdoor experience up to this point consisted of being
48,00:03:30.71,00:03:30.71,maybe 20 to 40 feet off the road.
49,00:03:33.08,00:03:33.08,"This is totally new for me-- sleeping outdoors, finding food."
50,00:03:37.33,00:03:37.33,"I love coconut, but it's granulated, already shredded in"
51,00:03:40.71,00:03:40.71,the grocery store. So...
52,00:03:48.33,00:03:48.33,">> It is, I see. >> But believe me, it's worth"
53,00:03:50.29,00:03:50.29,"it. >> Oh, okay."
54,00:03:52.00,00:03:52.00,>> Okay? >> Wow!
55,00:04:03.12,00:04:03.12,"So you're a native, huh? >> I'm native, almost."
56,00:04:05.33,00:04:05.33,I am definitely trying to prove myself.
57,00:04:08.58,00:04:08.58,"I can see that all the other guys are quite young, like half"
58,00:04:11.75,00:04:11.75,my age. Old people are usually the first
59,00:04:14.38,00:04:14.38,"ones to get booted off, so I'm hoping I will be the exception"
60,00:04:16.88,00:04:16.88,"here because I know the surroundings, and I can help get"
61,00:04:19.12,00:04:19.12,them coconut to drink. >> Did you just open that?
62,00:04:24.79,00:04:24.79,"Oh, thanks! >> So what are you thinking"
63,00:04:27.50,00:04:27.50,"right now? >> Man, I don't know."
64,00:04:29.38,00:04:29.38,Too many people in one place right now.
65,00:04:31.38,00:04:31.38,That's what makes me a little bit nervous.
66,00:04:33.12,00:04:33.12,>> Yeah. >> What do you think?
67,00:04:35.71,00:04:35.71,">> I mean, there's 19 of us. So how do you split that up into"
68,00:04:38.33,00:04:38.33,"two tribes? >> We're like, you know, looking"
69,00:04:40.79,00:04:40.79,"around the island for a machete. We're looking for, like, flags"
70,00:04:42.71,00:04:42.71,"for our tribe. We don't have a pot, we don't"
71,00:04:44.58,00:04:44.58,"have water, we don't have anything."
72,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,"We don't even know our tribe name, you know?"
73,00:04:48.04,00:04:48.04,"It's incredibly overwhelming, because there are so many people"
74,00:04:50.17,00:04:50.17,and none of us have a clue what's going on.
75,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,"We're looking for Jeff Probst. We're like, ""Where's Jeff?"""
76,00:05:00.67,00:05:00.67,">> Come on, we've got visitors! >> Bring it in!"
77,00:05:21.25,00:05:21.25,>> Where's the box? >> I think they got it.
78,00:05:23.58,00:05:23.58,">> Oh, they got it? >> Yeah."
79,00:05:25.54,00:05:25.54,>> We have a box! >> Our heroes!
80,00:05:27.54,00:05:27.54,>> It's got a genie in it! >> Everybody was excited.
81,00:05:31.21,00:05:31.21,Maybe we can get a machete. Maybe we can get fire.
82,00:05:33.58,00:05:33.58,Everybody was anticipating what they wanted to be in that box.
83,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,">> Wait, that can't be the way into the box."
84,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,>> Rocky! Rocky!
85,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,Rocky! >> Whoa!
86,00:05:56.17,00:05:56.17,">> The strongest guys start, like, throwing that thing down,"
87,00:05:59.00,00:05:59.00,"hammering it, punching it. And here comes the little"
88,00:06:02.67,00:06:02.67,"scrawny guy, Yau-Man. And he opens the whole thing"
89,00:06:07.50,00:06:07.50,"like, you know, in ten seconds. >> It takes a real man to do it."
90,00:06:10.92,00:06:10.92,>> Very simple physics. The weakest point is to drop it
91,00:06:14.46,00:06:14.46,on its corner. So I dropped it on its corner
92,00:06:16.92,00:06:16.92,"twice, and the box opened up. >> Listen up."
93,00:06:25.54,00:06:25.54,"This is very important. >> ""Welcome survivors."
94,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,"Before you do anything else, you must find the hidden cache of"
95,00:06:31.00,00:06:31.00,lumber and supplies. Its location is shown on the
96,00:06:33.50,00:06:33.50,"map."" >> Tree mail, right here."
97,00:06:35.71,00:06:35.71,">> ""Use the supplies to construct the best possible"
98,00:06:37.33,00:06:37.33,living area you can using the blueprints provided as your
99,00:06:39.08,00:06:39.08,"guide."" >> We've got a toilet seat on"
100,00:06:41.38,00:06:41.38,there. >> What?
101,00:06:43.71,00:06:43.71,">> Toilet assembly. >> ""Included with this note is a"
102,00:06:46.38,00:06:46.38,flint to start fire. Make sure you boil your water
103,00:06:48.17,00:06:48.17,"before drinking. Do not waste any time."""
104,00:06:52.08,00:06:52.08,">> Let's rock 'n' roll. >> You know, we've got this map"
105,00:06:54.21,00:06:54.21,"and directions and instructions that says, you know, we have to"
106,00:06:56.71,00:06:56.71,"build a shelter, kitchen, and a toilet and a picnic table."
107,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,">> Initially, naively, I thought, ""Wow, this is awesome."""
108,00:07:08.12,00:07:08.12,"And then I thought, ""Wait a minute, this is Survivor."
109,00:07:11.71,00:07:11.71,This is going to mean something very cruel is going to happen
110,00:07:13.83,00:07:13.83,"very soon."" >> Let's go do it."
111,00:07:32.96,00:07:32.96,">> Excuse me, brother. >> Okay."
112,00:07:37.29,00:07:37.29,Here's the fork. Go straight this way.
113,00:07:39.92,00:07:39.92,>> It's got to be right there. >> Yeah.
114,00:07:43.92,00:07:43.92,>> I think I found it. >> Holy cow!
115,00:07:47.08,00:07:47.08,">> All right, all right! >> Ah!"
116,00:07:52.04,00:07:52.04,>> What we found at the top of the hill was just all kinds of
117,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,"lumber. And it was, like, shingles for"
118,00:07:57.12,00:07:57.12,the roof of the shelter. There was all these crazy things
119,00:07:59.29,00:07:59.29,that no one in their right minds would ever imagine that we
120,00:08:01.83,00:08:01.83,were going to get when we got here.
121,00:08:03.92,00:08:03.92,">> Look at all the tools! >> Nails, hammers!"
122,00:08:08.42,00:08:08.42,>> We got a bag of rice the first day we were here. brother.
123,00:08:11.12,00:08:11.12,"You know, maybe a machete and bucket to boil water-- that's"
124,00:08:13.29,00:08:13.29,what anybody was expecting. No way... we have a toilet seat.
125,00:08:16.17,00:08:16.17,"I'll say it again, a toilet seat."
126,00:08:18.21,00:08:18.21,">> Okay, you, you, and you carry all that stuff down."
127,00:08:20.75,00:08:20.75,>> One on each shoulder. >> Give me that toilet seat.
128,00:08:27.71,00:08:27.71,I've never seen where people that come on Survivor have this
129,00:08:31.12,00:08:31.12,"much, so I'm really nervous, because I think a curve ball is"
130,00:08:33.12,00:08:33.12,coming. It's too easy.
131,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,">> The kitchen's going to be right there, okay?"
132,00:08:37.46,00:08:37.46,"The outhouse will be over there. There was a site plan, and being"
133,00:08:41.08,00:08:41.08,"an architect, of course, I was given all of the maps and said,"
134,00:08:44.71,00:08:44.71,"""Here, you figure out what to do."""
135,00:08:47.21,00:08:47.21,"So I looked at the site plan and realized the cave was, in fact,"
136,00:08:50.25,00:08:50.25,the location of the shelter. Then there would be a kitchen
137,00:08:54.50,00:08:54.50,"and an outhouse, and it was... it's a pretty amazing set of"
138,00:08:57.50,00:08:57.50,drawings. So we're building.
139,00:09:01.33,00:09:01.33,"Who's got the site plan? >> There's our shovels, all"
140,00:09:03.88,00:09:03.88,right? >> We need the shovel brigade to
141,00:09:06.21,00:09:06.21,start shoveling four holes. That's our number one thing.
142,00:09:08.50,00:09:08.50,Who's got the shovel? Who's got the site plan?
143,00:09:11.12,00:09:11.12,"Who's got the tape measure? We need a crew for the kitchen,"
144,00:09:14.54,00:09:14.54,or else it won't be done until tomorrow.
145,00:09:17.92,00:09:17.92,>> I do get the sense that Sylvia's trying to dominate.
146,00:09:20.67,00:09:20.67,"You know, we're all here to do this together, and you're going"
147,00:09:22.88,00:09:22.88,to upset the wagon by doing that.
148,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,">> He's what? All right, here's what's going"
149,00:09:31.29,00:09:31.29,"to happen-- whenever there is a big word in a sentence, we're"
150,00:09:33.33,00:09:33.33,"all going to have a time-out and teach James the big word, the"
151,00:09:35.75,00:09:35.75,definition. >> There's another big word
152,00:09:44.33,00:09:44.33,"James... orthagonal, huh? Learn something new every day,"
153,00:09:47.62,00:09:47.62,right? ( cheers )
154,00:09:53.46,00:09:53.46,>> All right! >> Proud of you!
155,00:09:57.04,00:09:57.04,">> When we started construction, everybody was, like, trying to,"
156,00:09:59.33,00:09:59.33,"like, you know, prove to other people that they can handle the"
157,00:10:01.67,00:10:01.67,"workload. But as, you know, the workload"
158,00:10:04.33,00:10:04.33,"started going on and on, and the people started going out in"
159,00:10:06.83,00:10:06.83,"couples, you could see that some people were talking."
160,00:10:16.46,00:10:16.46,>> I'm trying to talk to people and see what's going on so I
161,00:10:18.46,00:10:18.46,"can... you know, so I can get my place here."
162,00:10:21.12,00:10:21.12,">> Okay. >> So right now, just me, you."
163,00:10:23.33,00:10:23.33,>> We need a guy. >> We do need a guy.
164,00:10:25.42,00:10:25.42,>> Who? >> I don't know.
165,00:10:28.04,00:10:28.04,"Me and Jessica have kind of got... you know, we're talking,"
166,00:10:32.08,00:10:32.08,getting some stuff... getting some stuff together.
167,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,"We don't really know what's going to happen, so I think I"
168,00:10:37.92,00:10:37.92,need to be talking to as many people as I can.
169,00:10:42.25,00:10:42.25,">> No, y'all are just being silly."
170,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,"This water its too hot to drink. >> Just drink it, man."
171,00:10:46.71,00:10:46.71,>> It just burned me. I ain't going to drink it.
172,00:10:48.75,00:10:48.75,It burned me. >> So you guys want to... when
173,00:10:50.50,00:10:50.50,"you're done with the water, do you want to help with the"
174,00:10:52.46,00:10:52.46,"bathroom, or do you want to start with the kitchen?"
175,00:10:54.33,00:10:54.33,"I feel like it's not moving nearly as fast as it should,"
176,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,because we're still working on the primary shelter when the
177,00:10:59.25,00:10:59.25,kitchens and bathroom still need to be built.
178,00:11:01.29,00:11:01.29,We've got to get everything done okay?
179,00:11:03.21,00:11:03.21,"So put down... >> We need to get this done,"
180,00:11:05.12,00:11:05.12,because we're running out of light.
181,00:11:07.08,00:11:07.08,And we have to have this done. >> The night was rough.
182,00:11:42.54,00:11:42.54,"There we are with the shelter half done, no roof, half a"
183,00:11:46.25,00:11:46.25,"floor, and we ended up getting soaked."
184,00:11:50.42,00:11:50.42,So today we need to finish our shelter.
185,00:11:53.08,00:11:53.08,">> Can you, you know, lead a bunch of people to bring all the"
186,00:11:55.71,00:11:55.71,material down? >> It should be a two-by-four.
187,00:12:04.33,00:12:04.33,>> Two-by-four? Well....
188,00:12:06.29,00:12:06.29,>> This is a cup. Hold on to it.
189,00:12:11.21,00:12:11.21,"This is the funnel. >> Yau-Man, he's a keeper."
190,00:12:16.25,00:12:16.25,He figures out every little thing that goes on.
191,00:12:19.25,00:12:19.25,>> Drink in good health. >> Good hot tea.
192,00:12:23.92,00:12:23.92,>> Lemon. >> We're getting together.
193,00:12:30.46,00:12:30.46,All 19 of us are bonding. I don't know if it's a good
194,00:12:33.04,00:12:33.04,"thing or a bad thing, but it's bonding us."
195,00:12:35.12,00:12:35.12,"Oh, my god! That looks beautiful!"
196,00:12:37.42,00:12:37.42,>> We're rockin'. I'm taking this one home.
197,00:12:40.42,00:12:40.42,We've been here almost two days trying to figure out what's
198,00:12:42.96,00:12:42.96,going on. I think we just keep getting to
199,00:12:46.21,00:12:46.21,know each other until we get to the point where we get the next
200,00:12:48.54,00:12:48.54,set of instructions. >> We have a shelter.
201,00:12:58.54,00:12:58.54,It has a floor and a roof. We're going to have a kitchen.
202,00:13:01.46,00:13:01.46,We have an outhouse with an actual toilet.
203,00:13:04.21,00:13:04.21,It's really surprising to have so much on day two.
204,00:13:13.25,00:13:13.25,>> We're feeling pretty lucky right now.
205,00:13:15.67,00:13:15.67,"I mean, this is my Fiji vacation right now."
206,00:13:18.62,00:13:18.62,"I mean, we have everything that we need."
207,00:13:21.33,00:13:21.33,I'm scared about what's coming. >> All of your hard work to make
208,00:13:25.25,00:13:25.25,this place kind of a home for now!
209,00:13:28.42,00:13:28.42,>> Nice! >> ( applause )
210,00:13:31.25,00:13:31.25,>> Everybody! Everybody!
211,00:13:34.67,00:13:34.67,">> I can't take all the credit. Okay, I can."
212,00:13:37.46,00:13:37.46,But I just want to thank all my people for getting me coconuts
213,00:13:41.25,00:13:41.25,"while I was working. Back as a child, I was pretty"
214,00:13:44.88,00:13:44.88,"much homeless. By the age of seven, I was out"
215,00:13:49.46,00:13:49.46,of a house and just stayed in the back of a soup kitchen.
216,00:13:52.25,00:13:52.25,And then go into the trash cans and get the food.
217,00:13:54.17,00:13:54.17,"And it... I mean, it was kind of like what's going on right now."
218,00:13:56.92,00:13:56.92,The only thing you have to worry about is when it rains or when
219,00:14:00.33,00:14:00.33,you can't find no more food. I love it.
220,00:14:03.33,00:14:03.33,I wish I could bring my family from home here.
221,00:14:12.17,00:14:12.17,>> What kind of name is Earl? >> Dreamz?
222,00:14:15.08,00:14:15.08,>> What kind of name is Dreamz? >> Who said that?
223,00:14:18.62,00:14:18.62,Who said that? Back there.
224,00:14:21.04,00:14:21.04,Is that a Chinese person that said that?
225,00:14:23.46,00:14:23.46,"My thing is to be playful and play too much, just to make sure"
226,00:14:25.92,00:14:25.92,"they notice that I'm present, to know that my presence is there."
227,00:14:29.46,00:14:29.46,"Were you as great as I, you could say what you want to say."
228,00:14:37.92,00:14:37.92,>> You know what? >> Is he going to be quiet at
229,00:14:43.96,00:14:43.96,all tonight? >> Dreamz kind of came out of
230,00:14:46.08,00:14:46.08,"nowhere, like, late, while we were all trying to sleep."
231,00:14:48.25,00:14:48.25,"He was going off on little rants, like, every 15 to 20"
232,00:14:50.21,00:14:50.21,minutes. >> Where all the white people
233,00:14:52.96,00:14:52.96,"here? If you're white, raise your"
234,00:14:54.83,00:14:54.83,"hand. Rock, what color are you, man?"
235,00:15:00.29,00:15:00.29,">> I'm Italian, Irish, and Spanish."
236,00:15:02.46,00:15:02.46,>> You're talking to him or are you going to talk to me?
237,00:15:05.17,00:15:05.17,>> Just yelling about nonsense. And I'm exhausted.
238,00:15:08.29,00:15:08.29,"I don't know if the island is getting to him, but he's just"
239,00:15:11.04,00:15:11.04,getting a little irritating. Why don't you give me two
240,00:15:12.54,00:15:12.54,"seconds to talk, and then you can speak and we'll be done."
241,00:15:14.33,00:15:14.33,">> Go ahead, talk. >> All right, you get a little"
242,00:15:16.42,00:15:16.42,crazy sometimes. >> Just talk.
243,00:15:18.04,00:15:18.04,>> I'm talking right now. I'm talking to you right now.
244,00:15:19.62,00:15:19.62,You get a little jumpy with your voice.
245,00:15:21.29,00:15:21.29,"You snap, you snap... I don't care what you do with anybody"
246,00:15:23.29,00:15:23.29,"else, you snap a little bit at me."
247,00:15:25.08,00:15:25.08,"All right, I'm telling you right now, I don't want to be treated"
248,00:15:26.71,00:15:26.71,like that. Okay?
249,00:15:28.25,00:15:28.25,I'm just trying to go to sleep. I've been running around all
250,00:15:29.75,00:15:29.75,day. I don't need you to raise your
251,00:15:31.42,00:15:31.42,voice to me. Because I'm not a little girl.
252,00:15:32.96,00:15:32.96,>> I don't yell at people. That's not me.
253,00:15:34.29,00:15:34.29,>> What are you doing now? >> I'm talking to you.
254,00:15:36.12,00:15:36.12,I'm talking to you. I haven't yelled at anybody
255,00:15:37.29,00:15:37.29,"here. >> You're crazy, dude."
256,00:15:39.25,00:15:39.25,>> And I'm not going to let anybody belittle me.
257,00:15:40.83,00:15:40.83,>> What do I stand to gain by belittling you?
258,00:15:42.29,00:15:42.29,What do I stand to gain? >> I don't know.
259,00:15:44.33,00:15:44.33,Why? >> Because you yelled at me!
260,00:15:45.92,00:15:45.92,"That's why, that's why! >> You are yelling right now."
261,00:15:47.29,00:15:47.29,>> Because you don't pay attention.
262,00:15:49.29,00:15:49.29,"I'm trying to explain it to you. >> No, you yelled."
263,00:15:51.12,00:15:51.12,>> Go back to bed. Go back to bed and hang out with
264,00:15:52.75,00:15:52.75,"your friends. >> Whatever, Rock."
265,00:15:56.04,00:15:56.04,">> I'm pretty hard on myself when it comes to, like, letting"
266,00:15:58.46,00:15:58.46,my emotions show. I hate to do it.
267,00:16:00.42,00:16:00.42,"I used to do it when I was young, and I think I'm past that"
268,00:16:02.04,00:16:02.04,"now. But it's just really hard,"
269,00:16:04.12,00:16:04.12,especially under the conditions we're under right now.
270,00:16:06.08,00:16:06.08,"What am I supposed to do? >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
271,00:16:36.88,00:16:36.88,"Welcome to Survivor: Fiji. Jessica, tell me about the first"
272,00:16:40.88,00:16:40.88,few moments. You hit the beach.
273,00:16:43.92,00:16:43.92,What happens? >> It was wild.
274,00:16:46.08,00:16:46.08,"It was like a big beach party. >> PROBST: Yau-Man, I dropped a"

276,00:16:53.12,00:16:53.12,>> Someone found the canister and decided to open it and saw
277,00:16:55.12,00:16:55.12,the plans. And it's not just any shelter.
278,00:16:56.92,00:16:56.92,It looks like a very fancy shelter.
279,00:16:59.04,00:16:59.04,"And we're supposed to build it. >> PROBST: Alex, when you"
280,00:17:01.67,00:17:01.67,"started to assemble the shelter, did anybody emerge as the"
281,00:17:05.04,00:17:05.04,driving force on how to approach this?
282,00:17:07.62,00:17:07.62,">> I think initially we were all pretty confused, but luckily, we"
283,00:17:11.46,00:17:11.46,have an architect on board. So...
284,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,>> Who's the architect? >> Sylvia.

286,00:17:17.83,00:17:17.83,architect on here was extremely helpful.
287,00:17:19.67,00:17:19.67,>> PROBST: So the first big task is to build the shelter.
288,00:17:22.67,00:17:22.67,"And Sylvia, this is what you do every day."
289,00:17:25.12,00:17:25.12,>> I was so happy. I couldn't believe it.
290,00:17:27.71,00:17:27.71,">> PROBST: So it sounds like, Sylvia, you really stepped up to"
291,00:17:30.12,00:17:30.12,be the leader. Does that ring true to everybody
292,00:17:32.08,00:17:32.08,here? >> Yeah.
293,00:17:34.04,00:17:34.04,>> PROBST: Nobody disagrees with that?

481,00:28:36.67,00:28:36.67,not only did we go back to the place we helped put together.
482,00:28:40.04,00:28:40.04,We came back with a kick-ass tribe.
483,00:28:42.58,00:28:42.58,"All right, to us, guys! >> To Moto!"
484,00:28:46.25,00:28:46.25,">> Ironically enough, Sylvia, she helped build this place, and"
485,00:28:50.25,00:28:50.25,now she's sleeping with the snakes.
486,00:29:02.21,00:29:02.21,">> When I found out I was being exiled to Exile Island, Jeff was"
487,00:29:05.50,00:29:05.50,very clear that it was good and there was bad.
488,00:29:08.46,00:29:08.46,The bad was that I would be here by myself with a bunch of sea
489,00:29:12.21,00:29:12.21,snakes. Jeff had wander me about these
490,00:29:25.42,00:29:25.42,"sea snakes and I thought he was trying to pull my chain, you"
491,00:29:27.25,00:29:27.25,know. But it's for real.
492,00:29:30.25,00:29:30.25,I see them still. I see them.
493,00:29:32.25,00:29:32.25,"Oh, boy. The good was that I got the"
494,00:29:37.46,00:29:37.46,immunity. And there would be a clue giving
495,00:29:42.00,00:29:42.00,me some kind of hint about where the immunity idol was hidden.
496,00:29:47.08,00:29:47.08,"Wow, pretty spectacular. >> ""Here you won't find the idol"
497,00:29:56.50,00:29:56.50,you crave. Search back at your camp if you
498,00:29:59.00,00:29:59.00,"hope to be saved."" Okay."
499,00:30:02.67,00:30:02.67,I've been given this opportunity of a clue.
500,00:30:07.38,00:30:07.38,"But the clue said, ""Sorry, it's not here."
501,00:30:10.08,00:30:10.08,"It's back at camp."" So now I have to figure out a"
502,00:30:14.08,00:30:14.08,time and a place where I can search for it without prying
503,00:30:16.92,00:30:16.92,eyes. That's going to be a challenge
504,00:30:18.83,00:30:18.83,in itself. >> We're home.
505,00:30:40.08,00:30:40.08,>> Losing the challenge today felt horrible.
506,00:30:42.58,00:30:42.58,"All the work we put into the shelter, you know, learning the"
507,00:30:45.25,00:30:45.25,"island, just everything, you know, you get accustomed to,"
508,00:30:47.58,00:30:47.58,it's gone. >> We have a cave right there.
509,00:30:55.71,00:30:55.71,>> Awesome. This is awesome!
510,00:30:59.04,00:30:59.04,This place is so nice! >> Is it amazing?
511,00:31:01.25,00:31:01.25,>> I'm glad we lost. ( laughter )
512,00:31:03.92,00:31:03.92,"Keep their stupid shower. >> Yeah, that cave is gorgeous."
513,00:31:06.29,00:31:06.29,The hardest part for me was not being able to go back to that
514,00:31:10.88,00:31:10.88,"shelter that we built. But, I mean, everybody else"
515,00:31:13.83,00:31:13.83,"seems like they're okay. It's like, ""Whatever."
516,00:31:15.92,00:31:15.92,"Oh, we lost it, but we're over here on this great island."""
517,00:31:19.04,00:31:19.04,"I mean, they're enjoying the blankets and pillows and the"
518,00:31:22.25,00:31:22.25,couch. We have to start all over.
519,00:31:24.92,00:31:24.92,"I'm pissed off, and I can't believe nobody else is."
520,00:31:27.21,00:31:27.21,"We worked hard on building that shelter, kitchen."
521,00:31:29.79,00:31:29.79,We worked hard. And that hurt the most.
522,00:31:33.21,00:31:33.21,">> Right now, we're back at square one, because we have"
523,00:31:36.08,00:31:36.08,"nothing. And at the same time, we've got"
524,00:31:38.88,00:31:38.88,to figure out a team member to lose.
525,00:31:47.38,00:31:47.38,>> Yeah. >> Don't get sad.
526,00:31:49.42,00:31:49.42,">> Oh, I'm not sad. >> All right, I'm just telling"
527,00:31:51.50,00:31:51.50,you. We've got to figure out.
528,00:31:53.42,00:31:53.42,"Me... maybe me, you, and Jess, we'll figure it out, yeah?"
529,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,>> Mm-hmm. >> All right.
530,00:31:57.21,00:31:57.21,">> Me, Jessica, and Rocky are really tight."
531,00:31:59.92,00:31:59.92,"We can swing the whole thing. >> And Michelle... Michelle,"
532,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,"she's a little ninja guy. She hangs from things, she jumps"
533,00:32:15.21,00:32:15.21,"around, she's really physically fit, and that's what we need"
534,00:32:18.04,00:32:18.04,right now. >> I'm not getting rid of
535,00:32:20.17,00:32:20.17,Monkey. I call her Monkey.
536,00:32:26.25,00:32:26.25,">> Like I said, I... >> We need strong people."
537,00:32:28.58,00:32:28.58,Rita has to go because Erica is strong.
538,00:32:31.21,00:32:31.21,">> Erica is no joke. >> Yeah, she's, like... she's"
539,00:32:33.29,00:32:33.29,the real deal. So...
540,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,>> Okay? >> Yeah.
541,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,">> All right? All right, and what a tangled"
542,00:32:39.08,00:32:39.08,"web we weave. It just sucks, Jess, because I"
543,00:32:44.46,00:32:44.46,don't want to get rid of anybody.
544,00:32:46.83,00:32:46.83,">> I know. I feel bad, too."
545,00:32:48.29,00:32:48.29,">> I don't want to get rid of anybody, but it's the game,"
546,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,right? What are you going to do?
547,00:32:51.88,00:32:51.88,>> We just have to stick together.
548,00:32:53.38,00:32:53.38,>> We will. I just feel so safe with Rocky.
549,00:32:56.46,00:32:56.46,"I feel good now that I know it's not me, because I was working on"
550,00:33:00.38,00:33:00.38,that puzzle. We lost on the puzzle.
551,00:33:03.50,00:33:03.50,>> We're thinking Jessica. >> Who?
552,00:33:06.21,00:33:06.21,>> Jessica. >> She's dispensable.
553,00:33:09.25,00:33:09.25,"Her third puzzle was hers. >> I mean, I hear you that"
554,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,point. But could the third one have
555,00:33:14.12,00:33:14.12,been harder? Was it harder?
556,00:33:16.25,00:33:16.25,>> They were all same. >> They were all kind of the
557,00:33:17.79,00:33:17.79,same? >> Yeah.
558,00:33:19.29,00:33:19.29,">> That's a valid point. >> It's over here, right?"
559,00:33:30.08,00:33:30.08,">> I will. >> That way I know, all right?"
560,00:33:32.88,00:33:32.88,">> I will, because me, you and Erica are going to stick"
561,00:33:34.79,00:33:34.79,together. >> Yeah.
562,00:33:36.88,00:33:36.88,>> I will tell you. >> We were all kind of pointing
563,00:33:40.00,00:33:40.00,at Jessica. We all adore her.
564,00:33:42.08,00:33:42.08,It's nothing personality-wise. I get along super good with her.
565,00:33:52.46,00:33:52.46,So I'm kind of hurting to have to do that.
566,00:33:54.04,00:33:54.04,>> My concern is to really keep all the strong guys.
567,00:33:56.67,00:33:56.67,>> I would say Rita's stronger than Jessica.
568,00:34:00.38,00:34:00.38,"She is. >> I have, too."
569,00:34:07.21,00:34:07.21,>> Just don't think on a personal level.
570,00:34:09.08,00:34:09.08,"Just think the next challenge. >> Dude, this is business."
571,00:34:11.25,00:34:11.25,>> They just came to a conclusion that Jessica has to
572,00:34:15.88,00:34:15.88,be voted out. I... I won't write Jessica's
573,00:34:18.21,00:34:18.21,name down. I'm not going to do it.
574,00:34:25.83,00:34:25.83,>> Who? How do you know that?
575,00:34:28.42,00:34:28.42,And how did that come about? >> I don't know how it came
576,00:34:30.83,00:34:30.83,about. I just know it.
577,00:34:32.42,00:34:32.42,>> Just tell me who you heard it from.
578,00:34:34.58,00:34:34.58,Huh? Everybody?
579,00:34:37.21,00:34:37.21,"Well, I'm not putting her name down."
580,00:34:40.08,00:34:40.08,I won't put her name down. >> Me neither.
581,00:34:51.21,00:34:51.21,>> Tribal council tonight will be interesting.
582,00:34:55.08,00:34:55.08,"Everybody's nervous, and you still wonder in the back of your"
583,00:34:58.21,00:34:58.21,"mind-- like, it might be you. Always keep your guard up."
584,00:35:02.04,00:35:02.04,You never know when people are trying to trick you.
585,00:35:05.21,00:35:05.21,"It's a lot of actors here, a lot of poker faces."
586,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,This is my poker face. >> PROBST: Go ahead and grab a
587,00:35:51.21,00:35:51.21,torch. Approach the flame.
588,00:35:53.29,00:35:53.29,"Dip it in, get fire. This is part of the ritual of"
589,00:36:02.04,00:36:02.04,"tribal council. As long as you have fire, you're"
590,00:36:04.42,00:36:04.42,"still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are"
591,00:36:06.58,00:36:06.58,you. Take a seat.
592,00:36:16.04,00:36:16.04,"Michelle, how frustrating is it right now to know that there are"
593,00:36:19.08,00:36:19.08,nine people sleeping peacefully in a shelter you helped build?
594,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,">> It was a frustrating thought at first, but I think it's okay"
595,00:36:28.42,00:36:28.42,now. We actually really like our new
596,00:36:30.88,00:36:30.88,island. >> PROBST: I can't wait to hear
597,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,how you've turned this in your head.
598,00:36:35.21,00:36:35.21,"Erica, what's so great about the new island that you don't"
599,00:36:37.58,00:36:37.58,miss the old one? >> We have an abundance of
600,00:36:40.17,00:36:40.17,coconut. >> PROBST: 36 days left.
601,00:36:43.58,00:36:43.58,You better have a lot of coconuts.
602,00:36:45.88,00:36:45.88,">> I mean, it's not a fantasy land."
603,00:36:48.04,00:36:48.04,"The reality is, we don't have fire."
604,00:36:50.62,00:36:50.62,"And without the fire, we don't have water."
605,00:36:53.04,00:36:53.04,"You know, and I'm glad everybody has themselves together, and"
606,00:36:55.08,00:36:55.08,we're going to make it work. But it's going to take hard
607,00:36:57.04,00:36:57.04,work. And it starts immediately.
608,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,">> PROBST: James, how big of an advantage is it for the other"
609,00:37:03.25,00:37:03.25,"tribe to not only have shelter, but to have fire, to have water?"
610,00:37:09.04,00:37:09.04,">> I think they have a huge advantage right now, but I think"
611,00:37:11.21,00:37:11.21,this group's got something special.
612,00:37:13.21,00:37:13.21,I think we're going to rise above and hopefully knock them
613,00:37:15.21,00:37:15.21,off their perch the next time we go against them in the
614,00:37:16.88,00:37:16.88,challenge. >> PROBST: So now you've got to
615,00:37:19.17,00:37:19.17,vote somebody out. You haven't had much time really
616,00:37:23.88,00:37:23.88,to even assess why you would keep somebody or why you would
617,00:37:26.38,00:37:26.38,"get rid of somebody. So Erica, what do you use for"
618,00:37:28.92,00:37:28.92,the criteria? >> I think we're going to fall
619,00:37:31.17,00:37:31.17,behind if we lose another challenge.
620,00:37:33.29,00:37:33.29,"We know everybody has something good to offer, but somebody has"
621,00:37:36.25,00:37:36.25,"to go. >> PROBST: Yau-Man, you've got"
622,00:37:39.88,00:37:39.88,"to be a little concerned, with all due respect, simply due to"
623,00:37:42.46,00:37:42.46,"age. >> Yes, I feel very vulnerable,"
624,00:37:45.08,00:37:45.08,because I'm not... physically not the strongest one.
625,00:37:48.12,00:37:48.12,"And in order to win the next challenge, I want to keep all"
626,00:37:50.25,00:37:50.25,the strong guys. And if everybody thinks like
627,00:37:53.25,00:37:53.25,"that, I think I'm going to be a target, and I hope they don't."
628,00:37:56.08,00:37:56.08,">> PROBST: Mookie, will this tribe be better after tonight's"
629,00:38:00.25,00:38:00.25,vote? >> It's hard to say.
630,00:38:04.04,00:38:04.04,I think my vote's based upon whether that person can be
631,00:38:08.08,00:38:08.08,replaced by Sylvia. Does she or he contribute enough
632,00:38:12.08,00:38:12.08,"or more than Sylvia would? >> PROBST: Rocky, do you think"
633,00:38:16.25,00:38:16.25,the person voted out tonight will be surprised?
634,00:38:19.04,00:38:19.04,>> Yeah. I think so.
635,00:38:21.42,00:38:21.42,I think so. I think so.
636,00:38:23.21,00:38:23.21,"Because I know if I'm voted off, I'm surprised."
637,00:38:25.46,00:38:25.46,"I'm sure if anybody here, surprise, too."
638,00:38:27.25,00:38:27.25,"So yeah, I bet there will be a big surprise coming up real"
639,00:38:29.88,00:38:29.88,"soon. >> PROBST: Rita, if it's you"
640,00:38:33.21,00:38:33.21,"tonight, do you understand why they would get rid of you?"
641,00:38:35.17,00:38:35.17,>> I would be very surprised. Because I think that I am
642,00:38:38.21,00:38:38.21,contributing for us to get ahead.
643,00:38:39.67,00:38:39.67,"But I would understand. >> PROBST: Mookie, if it's you,"
644,00:38:42.42,00:38:42.42,"would you understand? >> No, I would not understand."
645,00:38:45.50,00:38:45.50,">> PROBST: Jessica, would you understand?"
646,00:38:48.08,00:38:48.08,">> No. I mean, if I had been laying on"
647,00:38:50.00,00:38:50.00,"the beach, you know, getting some sun and just relaxing, then"
648,00:38:52.25,00:38:52.25,"maybe, yes, but no. >> PROBST: Okay, it is time to"
649,00:38:55.08,00:38:55.08,"vote. Michelle, you're up."
650,00:39:18.92,00:39:18.92,>> I'm sorry. This wasn't my idea.
651,00:39:45.58,00:39:45.58,>> Sorry. Nothing personal here.
652,00:39:48.25,00:39:48.25,This is strictly mercenary. I'm trying to stay alive to
653,00:39:50.21,00:39:50.21,fight another day. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
654,00:40:13.38,00:40:13.38,"votes. Once the vote are read, the"
655,00:40:27.17,00:40:27.17,decision is final. The person voted out will be
656,00:40:29.29,00:40:29.29,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
657,00:40:31.38,00:40:31.38,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Mookie."
658,00:40:42.12,00:40:42.12,Rita. Jessica.
659,00:40:52.25,00:40:52.25,Yau-Man. That's one vote each for Jessica
660,00:40:55.08,00:40:55.08,"Mookie, Rita, and Yau Man. Jessica."
661,00:41:01.71,00:41:01.71,Two vote Jessica. Three votes Jessica.
662,00:41:12.42,00:41:12.42,"First person voted out of Survivor: Fiji, Jessica."
663,00:41:16.92,00:41:16.92,"That's four, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch."
664,00:41:28.25,00:41:28.25,"Jessica, the tribe has spoken. >> PROBST: Well, nearly half the"
665,00:41:46.50,00:41:46.50,tribe got at least one vote. Going to be a lot of people
666,00:41:49.38,00:41:49.38,wondering what they did to earn a vote and what they can do
667,00:41:51.42,00:41:51.42,tomorrow to make sure it doesn't happen again.
668,00:41:53.67,00:41:53.67,"Because you do not have fire, you will not be taking your"
669,00:41:55.92,00:41:55.92,torches back with you. Grab your stuff.
670,00:41:57.79,00:41:57.79,Head back to camp. Good night.
671,00:42:13.58,00:42:13.58,>> PROBST: stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
672,00:42:21.67,00:42:21.67,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
673,00:42:23.62,00:42:23.62,">> Water. Just lick some leafs, man."
674,00:42:26.08,00:42:26.08,">> Ravu gets weaker. >> I'm starving, I'm thirsty."
675,00:42:29.08,00:42:29.08,">> Earl gets primal. >> Sorry there, buddy-- I can't"
676,00:42:33.00,00:42:33.00,"take that chance. >> Boo, be careful."
677,00:42:35.25,00:42:35.25,>> PROBST: And Boo's luck... >> I need some medical.
678,00:42:37.54,00:42:37.54,I get injured a lot. >> PROBST: ...runs out.
679,00:42:39.42,00:42:39.42,>> Boo will hurt himself out of the game.
680,00:42:45.58,00:42:45.58,">> I guess if you're going to get back-stabbed, it's good to"
681,00:42:48.83,00:42:48.83,get it done in the beginning when you don't know people that
682,00:42:51.21,00:42:51.21,well. I was absolutely shocked.
683,00:42:53.21,00:42:53.21,I felt like I worked really hard.
684,00:42:55.21,00:42:55.21,So I don't know where I went wrong.
685,00:42:57.04,00:42:57.04,I feel honored to have been able to play a game that not many
686,00:43:00.17,00:43:00.17,people get to play. My torch may have been snuffed
687,00:43:02.25,00:43:02.25,"here, but I'm sure it's being lit somewhere else."
