1,00:00:11.75,00:00:11.75,"over the stunning water of theFiji Islands, a place once known"
2,00:00:15.08,00:00:15.08,"for its cannibalism, unchartedreefs, and formidable warriors."
3,00:00:20.79,00:00:20.79,"These islands are home tospectacular sea life and lush,"
4,00:00:24.62,00:00:24.62,jagged terrain.Just below are 19 strangers
5,00:00:32.21,00:00:32.21,"that represent an extremecross-section of America, from a"
6,00:00:36.71,00:00:36.71,former homeless street performerto a Harvard-educated lawyer.
7,00:00:41.00,00:00:41.00,They have been given absolutelyno information.
8,00:00:44.33,00:00:44.33,The fear of the unknown is sostrong that one survivor quit
9,00:00:47.75,00:00:47.75,just moments before being setadrift miles from shore.
10,00:00:52.25,00:00:52.25,"Exile Island is back, withhundreds of deadly sea snakes."
11,00:00:58.00,00:00:58.00,"And this time, two hiddenimmunity idols will complicate"
12,00:01:01.00,00:01:01.00,"the game like never before.39 days, 19 people, one"
13,00:01:09.58,00:01:09.58,"survivor.>> When I got there, I noticed"
14,00:01:24.58,00:01:24.58,"we were, like, all 19 of ustogether."
15,00:01:27.92,00:01:27.92,I thought that Jeff was going tobe there and we were going to
16,00:01:29.71,00:01:29.71,"be, like, split into tribes, and""You go this way and you go the"
17,00:01:31.12,00:01:31.12,"other way.""But it wasn't the case."
18,00:01:47.17,00:01:47.17,">> In my past, where I used towork and stuff, they called me"
19,00:01:49.12,00:01:49.12,Stallone.They called me... I guess I look
20,00:01:51.17,00:01:51.17,like Sylvester Stallone orRocky.
21,00:01:53.00,00:01:53.00,"I have droopy eyes, dark hair.For some reason James was too"
22,00:01:55.71,00:01:55.71,"hard for them to remember, soRocky will suffice."
23,00:02:05.00,00:02:05.00,">> We were just so excited toget here, it didn't matter what"
24,00:02:07.17,00:02:07.17,we were doing.We were lost on a deserted
25,00:02:09.54,00:02:09.54,"island, you know?What would anybody do?"
26,00:02:12.29,00:02:12.29,"Go explore.>> Oh, it's water!"
27,00:02:14.75,00:02:14.75,">> Yeah, water!>> Water!"
28,00:02:19.38,00:02:19.38,>> Where?>> Filled my canteen.
29,00:02:23.00,00:02:23.00,"I'll tell you right now, I lostmy mind."
30,00:02:24.92,00:02:24.92,"I didn't know what to do, Ididn't know what to say."
31,00:02:26.71,00:02:26.71,I was running around like achicken with my head cut off.
32,00:02:34.58,00:02:34.58,">> We look, and there's thisbig, beautiful cave."
33,00:02:36.38,00:02:36.38,"We're like, ""This is a blessing.We're like, ""We're great."""
34,00:02:38.50,00:02:38.50,>> I found a lemon tree.>> We've got banana trees over
35,00:02:40.96,00:02:40.96,there.We've got papaya over there.
36,00:02:43.17,00:02:43.17,"We are stoked.>> Well, my real name is Andre."
37,00:02:49.71,00:02:49.71,But on this beach I go byDreamz.
38,00:02:57.21,00:02:57.21,I came up with the name Dreamz along time ago.
39,00:02:59.58,00:02:59.58,It was more of a name ofstriving and achievement.
40,00:03:03.38,00:03:03.38,">> I'm glad we came up here.Now, look at this."
41,00:03:06.88,00:03:06.88,"It's like buying a new house.You know, you want to see"
42,00:03:09.96,00:03:09.96,"everything-- the backyard, thefront yard, living room, the"
43,00:03:12.50,00:03:12.50,dining room.You want to see everything
44,00:03:14.88,00:03:14.88,that's in your house.And this is our house.
45,00:03:17.25,00:03:17.25,"I'm the king of Fiji, of anunnamed island."
46,00:03:28.12,00:03:28.12,>> My outdoor experience up tothis point consisted of being
47,00:03:30.71,00:03:30.71,maybe 20 to 40 feet off theroad.
48,00:03:33.08,00:03:33.08,"This is totally new for me--sleeping outdoors, finding food."
49,00:03:37.33,00:03:37.33,"I love coconut, but it'sgranulated, already shredded in"
50,00:03:40.71,00:03:40.71,the grocery store.So...
51,00:03:48.33,00:03:48.33,">> It is, I see.>> But believe me, it's worth"
52,00:03:50.29,00:03:50.29,"it.>> Oh, okay."
53,00:03:52.00,00:03:52.00,>> Okay?>> Wow!
54,00:04:03.12,00:04:03.12,"So you're a native, huh?>> I'm native, almost."
55,00:04:05.33,00:04:05.33,I am definitely trying to provemyself.
56,00:04:08.58,00:04:08.58,"I can see that all the otherguys are quite young, like half"
57,00:04:11.75,00:04:11.75,my age.Old people are usually the first
58,00:04:14.38,00:04:14.38,"ones to get booted off, so I'mhoping I will be the exception"
59,00:04:16.88,00:04:16.88,"here because I know thesurroundings, and I can help get"
60,00:04:19.12,00:04:19.12,them coconut to drink.>> Did you just open that?
61,00:04:24.79,00:04:24.79,"Oh, thanks!>> So what are you thinking"
62,00:04:27.50,00:04:27.50,"right now?>> Man, I don't know."
63,00:04:29.38,00:04:29.38,Too many people in one placeright now.
64,00:04:31.38,00:04:31.38,That's what makes me a littlebit nervous.
65,00:04:33.12,00:04:33.12,>> Yeah.>> What do you think?
66,00:04:35.71,00:04:35.71,">> I mean, there's 19 of us.So how do you split that up into"
67,00:04:38.33,00:04:38.33,"two tribes?>> We're like, you know, looking"
68,00:04:40.79,00:04:40.79,"around the island for a machete.We're looking for, like, flags"
69,00:04:42.71,00:04:42.71,"for our tribe.We don't have a pot, we don't"
70,00:04:44.58,00:04:44.58,"have water, we don't haveanything."
71,00:04:46.17,00:04:46.17,"We don't even know our tribename, you know?"
72,00:04:48.04,00:04:48.04,"It's incredibly overwhelming,because there are so many people"
73,00:04:50.17,00:04:50.17,and none of us have a cluewhat's going on.
74,00:04:52.50,00:04:52.50,"We're looking for Jeff Probst.We're like, ""Where's Jeff?"""
75,00:05:00.67,00:05:00.67,">> Come on, we've got visitors!>> Bring it in!"
76,00:05:21.25,00:05:21.25,>> Where's the box?>> I think they got it.
77,00:05:23.58,00:05:23.58,">> Oh, they got it?>> Yeah."
78,00:05:25.54,00:05:25.54,>> We have a box!>> Our heroes!
79,00:05:27.54,00:05:27.54,>> It's got a genie in it!>> Everybody was excited.
80,00:05:31.21,00:05:31.21,Maybe we can get a machete.Maybe we can get fire.
81,00:05:33.58,00:05:33.58,Everybody was anticipating whatthey wanted to be in that box.
82,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,">> Wait, that can't be the wayinto the box."
83,00:05:45.17,00:05:45.17,>> Rocky!Rocky!
84,00:05:47.17,00:05:47.17,Rocky!>> Whoa!
85,00:05:56.17,00:05:56.17,">> The strongest guys start,like, throwing that thing down,"
86,00:05:59.00,00:05:59.00,"hammering it, punching it.And here comes the little"
87,00:06:02.67,00:06:02.67,"scrawny guy, Yau-Man.And he opens the whole thing"
88,00:06:07.50,00:06:07.50,"like, you know, in ten seconds.>> It takes a real man to do it."
89,00:06:10.92,00:06:10.92,>> Very simple physics.The weakest point is to drop it
90,00:06:14.46,00:06:14.46,on its corner.So I dropped it on its corner
91,00:06:16.92,00:06:16.92,"twice, and the box opened up.>> Listen up."
92,00:06:25.54,00:06:25.54,"This is very important.>> ""Welcome survivors."
93,00:06:28.21,00:06:28.21,"Before you do anything else, youmust find the hidden cache of"
94,00:06:31.00,00:06:31.00,lumber and supplies.Its location is shown on the
95,00:06:33.50,00:06:33.50,"map."">> Tree mail, right here."
96,00:06:35.71,00:06:35.71,">> ""Use the supplies toconstruct the best possible"

103,00:06:52.08,00:06:52.08,">> Let's rock 'n' roll.>> You know, we've got this map"
104,00:06:54.21,00:06:54.21,"and directions and instructionsthat says, you know, we have to"
105,00:06:56.71,00:06:56.71,"build a shelter, kitchen, and atoilet and a picnic table."
106,00:07:03.33,00:07:03.33,">> Initially, naively, Ithought, ""Wow, this is awesome."""
107,00:07:08.12,00:07:08.12,"And then I thought, ""Wait aminute, this is Survivor."
108,00:07:11.71,00:07:11.71,This is going to mean somethingvery cruel is going to happen
109,00:07:13.83,00:07:13.83,"very soon."">> Let's go do it."
110,00:07:32.96,00:07:32.96,">> Excuse me, brother.>> Okay."
111,00:07:37.29,00:07:37.29,Here's the fork.Go straight this way.
112,00:07:39.92,00:07:39.92,>> It's got to be right there.>> Yeah.
113,00:07:43.92,00:07:43.92,>> I think I found it.>> Holy cow!
114,00:07:47.08,00:07:47.08,">> All right, all right!>> Ah!"
115,00:07:52.04,00:07:52.04,>> What we found at the top ofthe hill was just all kinds of
116,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,"lumber.And it was, like, shingles for"
117,00:07:57.12,00:07:57.12,the roof of the shelter.There was all these crazy things
118,00:07:59.29,00:07:59.29,that no one in their right mindswould ever imagine that we
119,00:08:01.83,00:08:01.83,were going to get when we gothere.
120,00:08:03.92,00:08:03.92,">> Look at all the tools!>> Nails, hammers!"
121,00:08:08.42,00:08:08.42,>> We got a bag of rice thefirst day we were here. brother.
122,00:08:11.12,00:08:11.12,"You know, maybe a machete andbucket to boil water-- that's"
123,00:08:13.29,00:08:13.29,what anybody was expecting.No way... we have a toilet seat.
124,00:08:16.17,00:08:16.17,"I'll say it again, a toiletseat."
125,00:08:18.21,00:08:18.21,">> Okay, you, you, and you carryall that stuff down."
126,00:08:20.75,00:08:20.75,>> One on each shoulder.>> Give me that toilet seat.
127,00:08:27.71,00:08:27.71,I've never seen where peoplethat come on Survivor have this
128,00:08:31.12,00:08:31.12,"much, so I'm really nervous,because I think a curve ball is"
129,00:08:33.12,00:08:33.12,coming.It's too easy.
130,00:08:35.08,00:08:35.08,">> The kitchen's going to beright there, okay?"
131,00:08:37.46,00:08:37.46,"The outhouse will be over there.There was a site plan, and being"
132,00:08:41.08,00:08:41.08,"an architect, of course, I wasgiven all of the maps and said,"
133,00:08:44.71,00:08:44.71,"""Here, you figure out what todo."""
134,00:08:47.21,00:08:47.21,"So I looked at the site plan andrealized the cave was, in fact,"
135,00:08:50.25,00:08:50.25,the location of the shelter.Then there would be a kitchen
136,00:08:54.50,00:08:54.50,"and an outhouse, and it was...it's a pretty amazing set of"
137,00:08:57.50,00:08:57.50,drawings.So we're building.
138,00:09:01.33,00:09:01.33,"Who's got the site plan?>> There's our shovels, all"
139,00:09:03.88,00:09:03.88,right?>> We need the shovel brigade to
140,00:09:06.21,00:09:06.21,start shoveling four holes.That's our number one thing.
141,00:09:08.50,00:09:08.50,Who's got the shovel?Who's got the site plan?
142,00:09:11.12,00:09:11.12,"Who's got the tape measure?We need a crew for the kitchen,"
143,00:09:14.54,00:09:14.54,or else it won't be done untiltomorrow.
144,00:09:17.92,00:09:17.92,>> I do get the sense thatSylvia's trying to dominate.
145,00:09:20.67,00:09:20.67,"You know, we're all here to dothis together, and you're going"
146,00:09:22.88,00:09:22.88,to upset the wagon by doingthat.
147,00:09:28.67,00:09:28.67,">> He's what?All right, here's what's going"
148,00:09:31.29,00:09:31.29,"to happen-- whenever there is abig word in a sentence, we're"

154,00:09:57.04,00:09:57.04,">> When we started construction,everybody was, like, trying to,"
155,00:09:59.33,00:09:59.33,"like, you know, prove to otherpeople that they can handle the"
156,00:10:01.67,00:10:01.67,"workload.But as, you know, the workload"
157,00:10:04.33,00:10:04.33,"started going on and on, and thepeople started going out in"
158,00:10:06.83,00:10:06.83,"couples, you could see that somepeople were talking."
159,00:10:16.46,00:10:16.46,>> I'm trying to talk to peopleand see what's going on so I

166,00:10:35.12,00:10:35.12,"We don't really know what'sgoing to happen, so I think I"
167,00:10:37.92,00:10:37.92,need to be talking to as manypeople as I can.
168,00:10:42.25,00:10:42.25,">> No, y'all are just beingsilly."
169,00:10:44.25,00:10:44.25,"This water its too hot to drink.>> Just drink it, man."

174,00:10:54.33,00:10:54.33,"I feel like it's not movingnearly as fast as it should,"
175,00:10:56.83,00:10:56.83,because we're still working onthe primary shelter when the
176,00:10:59.25,00:10:59.25,kitchens and bathroom still needto be built.
177,00:11:01.29,00:11:01.29,We've got to get everything doneokay?

181,00:11:42.54,00:11:42.54,"There we are with the shelterhalf done, no roof, half a"
182,00:11:46.25,00:11:46.25,"floor, and we ended up gettingsoaked."
183,00:11:50.42,00:11:50.42,So today we need to finish ourshelter.
184,00:11:53.08,00:11:53.08,">> Can you, you know, lead abunch of people to bring all the"
