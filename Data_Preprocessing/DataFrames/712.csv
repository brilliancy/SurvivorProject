192,00:12:39.70,00:12:39.70,">> Yep, there's our island.>> It sure is."
193,00:12:44.30,00:12:44.30,>> I wish it was me.>> ( Jon speaks inaudibly )
194,00:12:54.20,00:12:54.20,>> It is so gorgeous.It was a breathtaking view.
195,00:12:56.67,00:12:56.67,It was somethingthat I'm not going to forget
196,00:12:59.07,00:12:59.07,for a long time.>> We've only seen
197,00:13:02.20,00:13:02.20,the Pearl Islands via our boat.Words can't describe
198,00:13:05.50,00:13:05.50,"how big this place is.I mean, there's just ocean,"
199,00:13:08.20,00:13:08.20,"ocean, ocean, ocean,and the biggest islands"
200,00:13:09.80,00:13:09.80,you've ever seenand the smallest islands
201,00:13:11.33,00:13:11.33,you've ever seen.There was just so many of them
202,00:13:13.47,00:13:13.47,everywhere.>> That was fabulous.
203,00:13:19.30,00:13:19.30,"( cheerful scream )>> Oh, wow."
204,00:13:22.17,00:13:22.17,">> Oh, my gosh!Look at this!"
205,00:13:25.13,00:13:25.13,>> We had no idea how coolthe hotel would be.
206,00:13:28.43,00:13:28.43,"And when we got here, it's,uh... this is absolute paradise."
207,00:13:32.90,00:13:32.90,">> Oh, my God!>> The room is huge."
208,00:13:36.30,00:13:36.30,"There was a big living room,a huge bedroom,"
209,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,"a big bathroom, mirrors.>> Whoo!"
210,00:13:41.87,00:13:41.87,>> ( screams )>> Wow.
211,00:13:44.13,00:13:44.13,">> Oh, my gosh...>> It's not me!"
212,00:13:46.13,00:13:46.13,>> Look at my eyebrows.>> That first look at myself
213,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,"in a mirror was so shocking.Oh, my gosh!"
214,00:13:53.93,00:13:53.93,>> I have lost so much weight.>> I hadn't seen myself for...
215,00:13:57.33,00:13:57.33,30-some days.>> Shower.
216,00:14:00.97,00:14:00.97,">> Shower!>> Oh, this feels so good."
217,00:14:06.13,00:14:06.13,">> We might tell D she's, uh...she's top three, just to keep"
218,00:14:12.60,00:14:12.60,her from jumping.>> I won't say a word.
219,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,">> This was, bar none, thegreatest reward we could be"
220,00:14:18.80,00:14:18.80,"given at this stage of the game.It gave me a chance, personally,"
221,00:14:23.20,00:14:23.20,"to talk with D and Lillwithout, uh, worrying about, uh,"
222,00:14:26.93,00:14:26.93,"Sandra and Christa overhearing,and gave me a chance to, uh,"
223,00:14:31.03,00:14:31.03,"heal up some of my, uh, warwounds from the first, uh,"
224,00:14:33.50,00:14:33.50,"30-plus days.>> Oh, baby."
225,00:14:44.23,00:14:44.23,The masseuse put cucumbersover my eyes.
226,00:14:46.97,00:14:46.97,I guess they do somethingfor the skin.
227,00:14:49.40,00:14:49.40,I think I needed a wholecucumber to do anything for my
228,00:14:51.93,00:14:51.93,"my skin.>> Oh, this is the best."
229,00:14:54.60,00:14:54.60,"The Pearl Islands are paradise.However, it sucks with the bugs."
230,00:14:59.57,00:14:59.57,It sucks with some of thepeople.
231,00:15:02.13,00:15:02.13,It sucks with the food.Yeah.
232,00:15:04.90,00:15:04.90,">> Oh!>> Here, this is paradise and"
233,00:15:08.10,00:15:08.10,"that's an awesome feeling.>> Oh, my gosh, this lady is"
234,00:15:11.00,00:15:11.00,good.>> I feel sorry for Burton
235,00:15:13.60,00:15:13.60,today.>> Hope this doesn't have
236,00:15:20.43,00:15:20.43,"to be a clean fillet,'cause I am shredding"
237,00:15:23.70,00:15:23.70,this thing.>> Did Jon talk to you
238,00:15:25.13,00:15:25.13,about everything?You're not going
239,00:15:26.37,00:15:26.37,"to screw us over?>> No, I haven't."
240,00:15:28.20,00:15:28.20,I haven't even talkedto him about anything.
241,00:15:30.57,00:15:30.57,"Jon said, if we saved you,that Darrah and Lill would go."
242,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,">> Okay! I, I haven'teven talked to Jon."
243,00:15:36.47,00:15:36.47,He just said...>> Jon told us the wrong thing.
244,00:15:39.47,00:15:39.47,He said that we'd be inthe final four;
245,00:15:41.07,00:15:41.07,it would be two and two--you and him and Sandra and I.
246,00:15:44.13,00:15:44.13,">> I'm in... I'm in a bitof an odd position right now,"
247,00:15:47.23,00:15:47.23,in that I am alone in the campwith Sandra and Christa.
248,00:15:50.57,00:15:50.57,"And I haven't talked to Jonfully about this, so I don't"
249,00:15:53.37,00:15:53.37,"know what to tell them.I mean, I've lied to them"
250,00:15:55.50,00:15:55.50,enough.I guess I could continue to lie.
251,00:15:57.97,00:15:57.97,"But at the same time,I don't want to piss them off,"
252,00:15:59.93,00:15:59.93,because they're goingto be on the jury
253,00:16:01.40,00:16:01.40,and I want to be the onethey vote for.
254,00:16:04.30,00:16:04.30,We all came togetherand we both saved each other.
255,00:16:06.97,00:16:06.97,"Well, if Christa wasn't onthe chopping block,"
256,00:16:09.03,00:16:09.03,it'd be one thing.You didn't make that
257,00:16:11.23,00:16:11.23,voting decision to save me.>> Burton has never been one
258,00:16:15.57,00:16:15.57,to talk to me and Christaclearly about anything.
259,00:16:18.43,00:16:18.43,But let it be knownthat if it wasn't for me
260,00:16:20.67,00:16:20.67,"and Christa,Burton would not be here today."
261,00:16:23.07,00:16:23.07,You would think thatthat would count for something.
262,00:16:26.63,00:16:26.63,"And then here he is sayingthat he, he can't promise us"
263,00:16:29.60,00:16:29.60,third and fourth.That's a bunch of baloney.
264,00:16:31.93,00:16:31.93,"The first chance I getto send him home,"
265,00:16:33.20,00:16:33.20,he's going home.>> It's just hard to tell.
266,00:16:36.33,00:16:36.33,I can't tell whenpeople lie anymore.
267,00:16:38.07,00:16:38.07,"Like, people can tellwhen I'm lying."
268,00:16:39.57,00:16:39.57,"I'm looking at them just like...>> Well, the thing"
269,00:16:41.47,00:16:41.47,"is around here is, like...just, everyone's lying"
270,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,to everyone.The only time you know
271,00:16:44.70,00:16:44.70,where someone standsis when they vote
272,00:16:46.10,00:16:46.10,at Tribal Council.The conversation that Sandra
273,00:16:47.70,00:16:47.70,and I had with Burtonwas a real eye-opener for me.
274,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33,"It was, uh... I saw the lightsuddenly."
275,00:16:54.20,00:16:54.20,">> I mean, no matter how strongyour best friend is out here,"
276,00:16:56.37,00:16:56.37,"at the end of the day,it's not as strong as"
277,00:16:59.10,00:16:59.10,"a million dollars.>> At this point, it's every man"
278,00:17:01.80,00:17:01.80,"for themselves, I see it.We're not here"
279,00:17:05.27,00:17:05.27,to make best friends.We're not here to do anything
280,00:17:07.70,00:17:07.70,like that.We're here to play a game
281,00:17:09.70,00:17:09.70,and get as far as we can.>> Ooh!
282,00:17:17.47,00:17:17.47,"Oh, we got pajamas.>> No way."
283,00:17:19.93,00:17:19.93,"( Lill squeals ):Oh, you're kidding!"
284,00:17:21.67,00:17:21.67,">> Oh, they're silk.>> Oh, my God."
285,00:17:24.27,00:17:24.27,">> On our bed was silky pajamas.We put them on, pranced around,"
286,00:17:29.93,00:17:29.93,showed them off.This is so exciting.
287,00:17:33.37,00:17:33.37,>> This is so wonderful.>> I think we have a table
288,00:17:38.67,00:17:38.67,"for three.>> When we got to dinner,"
289,00:17:40.70,00:17:40.70,"I was starving.And I, I..."
290,00:17:42.40,00:17:42.40,It was so nice to be ableto open a menu up
291,00:17:44.53,00:17:44.53,and to be able to read.I did remember how to read
292,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,after all this time.My mouth is watering.
293,00:17:50.77,00:17:50.77,>> Chicken fingerswill definitely be
294,00:17:52.07,00:17:52.07,a good appetizer.>> What about the clam?
295,00:17:54.60,00:17:54.60,">> Lill, you really wantto do clam"
296,00:17:56.70,00:17:56.70,after 31 days of eatingnothing but seafood?
297,00:17:59.17,00:17:59.17,"I'll order for you guys.For dinner, she would like"
298,00:18:02.60,00:18:02.60,the filet mignon.>> I love a man that takes over.
299,00:18:05.10,00:18:05.10,">> Me, too.>> How would you like"
300,00:18:06.97,00:18:06.97,"that prepared?>> Um, medium rare."
301,00:18:08.30,00:18:08.30,>> Medium rare.>> Jon ordered all the food
302,00:18:10.00,00:18:10.00,for all of us.I enjoyed that.
303,00:18:12.13,00:18:12.13,"You know, I, I like when a guytakes the initiative."
304,00:18:15.23,00:18:15.23,"Rock and roll, man.Rock and roll."
305,00:18:17.43,00:18:17.43,I'm a great date.I have a pretty extensive
306,00:18:19.93,00:18:19.93,"fine food knowledge,and I was able to show that off."
307,00:18:22.30,00:18:22.30,"( Lill gasps )>> Oh, my goodness."
308,00:18:24.80,00:18:24.80,"Oh, my...What's that?"
309,00:18:26.23,00:18:26.23,>> That's bruschetta.>> You're a whole lot more
310,00:18:28.93,00:18:28.93,smarter than me.>> There's a few more sides
311,00:18:31.20,00:18:31.20,to Jonny Fairplaythan these girls
312,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17,"had any clue about.And as Lill said, I'm much more"
313,00:18:35.90,00:18:35.90,than just a pretty face.I have noticed Sandra and
314,00:18:43.87,00:18:43.87,Christa will never give me avote.
315,00:18:46.60,00:18:46.60,>> Out in the water...>> Yeah.
316,00:18:49.53,00:18:49.53,">> ...they said to me,""We're going to kick out Jon"
317,00:18:51.90,00:18:51.90,"""and we're going to kick out,um, Burton."
318,00:18:53.90,00:18:53.90,">> Are you with us?""When we were eating,"
319,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,we talked a lot about what'sbeen going on behind the scenes.
320,00:19:02.70,00:19:02.70,I know that Jon had to promiseChrista and Sandra a lot
321,00:19:07.37,00:19:07.37,in order for themto back us up to get rid of T.
322,00:19:10.30,00:19:10.30,I had to promise on mygrandmother to them.
323,00:19:12.07,00:19:12.07,"Oh, no, no, no, no!Don't do that."
324,00:19:13.83,00:19:13.83,I had to.She's looking down here at you.
325,00:19:16.33,00:19:16.33,I know.She'll forgive me.
326,00:19:19.03,00:19:19.03,"I had so much fun in explainingto, uh, D and Lill that,"
327,00:19:22.03,00:19:22.03,"uh, Christa made me swearon my grandmother's grave."
328,00:19:25.00,00:19:25.00,And I told Lill that it upsetme so much to have to do that.
329,00:19:28.53,00:19:28.53,"And I was like, ""One of herlast wishes was that,"
330,00:19:31.07,00:19:31.07,"that I win.""( laughing )"
331,00:19:38.70,00:19:38.70,( laughing )Lill is very antsy
332,00:19:45.47,00:19:45.47,"and there was lots of strategythat we needed to go over, uh,"
333,00:19:51.43,00:19:51.43,for the last stage of the game.There's a lot of people
334,00:19:54.37,00:19:54.37,"worried about you, Lill.>> Why?"
335,00:19:55.73,00:19:55.73,>> Because.Who whispered this
336,00:19:57.60,00:19:57.60,morning that like...>> Lill is the queen of sitting
337,00:20:00.90,00:20:00.90,around the camp going...>> I am not!
338,00:20:05.40,00:20:05.40,">> Yes, you are.I am not!"
339,00:20:07.37,00:20:07.37,">> You hurt my feelings...>> Lill, I'm going to keep"
340,00:20:11.30,00:20:11.30,hurting your feelingsunless you start
341,00:20:12.50,00:20:12.50,telling the truth.>> I'm going to bed.
342,00:20:14.43,00:20:14.43,">> Lill, that's not helpinganything."
343,00:20:16.23,00:20:16.23,>> I'm going to bed.You hurt my feelings.
344,00:20:18.30,00:20:18.30,">> Lill, you're...you're doing more damage"
345,00:20:20.00,00:20:20.00,"than anything.>> Lill, get in here."
346,00:20:21.93,00:20:21.93,We got stuff to talk about.>> Jon talks down to me
347,00:20:25.10,00:20:25.10,"like I'm some idiot.Lill, it's the truth."
348,00:20:28.70,00:20:28.70,Make me soundlike a big-mouth.
349,00:20:30.17,00:20:30.17,It is not the truth.He wants to show
350,00:20:32.30,00:20:32.30,"that he's in charge and...you know, I've seen that before."
351,00:20:35.37,00:20:35.37,And I'm thinkingthat may be his way
352,00:20:37.90,00:20:37.90,of separating himself from me.( thunder crashing )
353,00:20:53.97,00:20:53.97,">> So, I was thinkingabout Darrah."
354,00:20:55.60,00:20:55.60,"I tell you, after thatthat challenge, I fear her"
355,00:20:57.93,00:20:57.93,"most in something like that,'cause I think she has"
356,00:21:00.40,00:21:00.40,a good chance of winning.>> Yep. Watch your step on here.
357,00:21:02.90,00:21:02.90,">> This morning, Christa and Iwent out looking for mussels"
358,00:21:05.37,00:21:05.37,"to eat.And she brought up a strategy,"
359,00:21:07.27,00:21:07.27,"again, what I was thinking.But she is willing"
360,00:21:10.43,00:21:10.43,"to make concessions,and she's looking, um,"
361,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,"to get farther in the game.So, it's a good thing to know."
362,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,"Well, let me ask you this...Without having talked to Jon,"
363,00:21:19.87,00:21:19.87,I have no idea what's going on.>> But...
364,00:21:22.50,00:21:22.50,>> But... would you vote Sandraout next if that was the case?
365,00:21:26.80,00:21:26.80,">> I would go along with it,if that's what you guys"
366,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,wanted me to doand get rid of her first.
367,00:21:30.60,00:21:30.60,"But from a strategicstandpoint,"
368,00:21:33.57,00:21:33.57,and just seeing how Darrahis most likely
369,00:21:36.17,00:21:36.17,"to win immunity...I mean, I know that it's"
370,00:21:38.83,00:21:38.83,"probably not going to besomething super physical,"
371,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,but Darrah was a cheerleaderand she can hang in
372,00:21:43.40,00:21:43.40,"for long periods of time,you know?"
373,00:21:45.13,00:21:45.13,Right.>> Nothing Christa said this
374,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,morning really surprised me.I had a feeling she would
375,00:21:49.87,00:21:49.87,stab Sandra in the back if sheneeded to.
376,00:21:52.63,00:21:52.63,She does really want Darrahto go first.

378,00:21:59.57,00:21:59.57,to have Christa in the top four.Because if Jon did do
379,00:22:02.43,00:22:02.43,"something funny,um, I'm pretty sure I could beat"
380,00:22:05.37,00:22:05.37,Christa at Tribal Council.I think she's rubbed a lot
381,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,of people the wrong way.I would like to see you
382,00:22:09.30,00:22:09.30,in the top four.I really want to go
383,00:22:11.07,00:22:11.07,to the top four.And I will do what I can
384,00:22:13.87,00:22:13.87,"to get you there.So, you..."
385,00:22:15.87,00:22:15.87,you got my word on that.>> I think that Burton
386,00:22:18.87,00:22:18.87,"understands that this is a game,and we're all trying"
387,00:22:21.17,00:22:21.17,to get ahead.Me stabbing Sandra in the back
388,00:22:23.53,00:22:23.53,and getting rid of her...isn't anything personal.
389,00:22:27.73,00:22:27.73,It's nothing about that.It's about getting farther ahead
390,00:22:31.00,00:22:31.00,and doing the right thingto win this game.
391,00:22:50.40,00:22:50.40,">> Good morning.>> This morning,"

395,00:23:05.93,00:23:05.93,and yet another advantagethat we have over the others
396,00:23:09.07,00:23:09.07,going into the final.>> I see Survivor as a big game
397,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63,of human chess.I felt that I could feed off
398,00:23:22.90,00:23:22.90,"Darrah's greed and basicallysay, ""Hey, look, you know,"
399,00:23:25.30,00:23:25.30,"there's no way anyonecan beat Lill in a jury."""
400,00:23:28.30,00:23:28.30,"And she agreed.I was like, you know, ""So,"

408,00:23:47.80,00:23:47.80,"He lies, but...he also tells the truth, too."
409,00:23:50.63,00:23:50.63,"And, I don't...I know he's not sitting here"
410,00:23:53.00,00:23:53.00,lying to me aboutgoing to the Final Two.
411,00:24:06.30,00:24:06.30,>> I want to know everything.Start from when

413,00:24:11.67,00:24:11.67,"returned from the reward,I was happy to see them,"
414,00:24:14.07,00:24:14.07,because I was gladthe reward was over for them.
415,00:24:16.77,00:24:16.77,I'm still jealous.But I wanted to hear everything.
416,00:24:19.80,00:24:19.80,I want to hear everythingfrom the beginning to the end.
417,00:24:22.27,00:24:22.27,">> All right, so, let me...We'll start at the beginning."
418,00:24:23.93,00:24:23.93,"Big bed,enough for three people,"

440,00:25:35.23,00:25:35.23,"I'm not worried about D,and I'm not worried about Lill."
441,00:25:38.23,00:25:38.23,">> Well, then, who's next?>> Huh?"
442,00:25:40.43,00:25:40.43,>> Who's next?>> Christa's next.
443,00:25:42.10,00:25:42.10,">> So, you're goingto blindside Christa?"

451,00:26:01.70,00:26:01.70,>> Okay.>> My strategy at this point in
452,00:26:04.90,00:26:04.90,"the game is to work with Jon.Jon's the bad cop,"
453,00:26:07.27,00:26:07.27,I'm the good cop.As we kick these people
454,00:26:09.83,00:26:09.83,"out of the game,if it all works as planned,"
455,00:26:12.37,00:26:12.37,they will be mad at Jonand not me.

462,00:26:50.43,00:26:50.43,>> I know it does.>> I've had two dreams

466,00:26:59.37,00:26:59.37,that we're the Final Two?>> I'm really not thinking.
467,00:27:03.67,00:27:03.67,I... don't want to thinkthat far in advance.
468,00:27:06.27,00:27:06.27,"Okay, you're telling me now thatyou've had second thoughts."
469,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40,That's not true.I think
470,00:27:11.50,00:27:11.50,"two Tribal Councils in advance.>> Last night, I couldn't sleep."
471,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03,And I got upand went to the fire.

473,00:27:22.20,00:27:22.20,"you and I at the end?""And he said, ""Let's just do"

481,00:27:48.77,00:27:48.77,What I have told Lillis that I will never lie
482,00:27:52.30,00:27:52.30,to her in this game.I told her I'd take her as far
483,00:27:54.80,00:27:54.80,as I could.And I do have
484,00:27:56.13,00:27:56.13,"an allegiance with her, and I dohave an alliance with her."
485,00:27:58.70,00:27:58.70,But I have never promised hertop two.
486,00:28:00.63,00:28:00.63,">> Well, I have a feelingI'd better make immunity, then."
487,00:28:06.13,00:28:06.13,">> It ticks me a little bit.Matter of fact, it pisses me off"
488,00:28:09.03,00:28:09.03,"a little bit, but...what can I do about it?"
489,00:28:11.63,00:28:11.63,Um... the only thingthat would save me is to
490,00:28:14.47,00:28:14.47,win immunity at the end.Then that may even justify me
491,00:28:17.97,00:28:17.97,"to turn my back on him.>> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
