14,00:00:34.43,00:00:34.43,grandmother had died. The tribe let Jon win the reward
15,00:00:42.53,00:00:42.53,so he could spend time with his best friend.

22,00:01:03.00,00:01:03.00,>> The fake dead grandmother could easily go down
23,00:01:05.60,00:01:05.60,as the dirtiest thing ever to be done in this game.

29,00:01:22.63,00:01:22.63,of their mouths than for me to put things in her head
30,00:01:25.03,00:01:25.03,and for her to have doubts. >> PROBST: At the immunity

32,00:01:30.97,00:01:30.97,Darrah wins immunity. Nice job.

45,00:03:26.57,00:03:26.57,"um, now we're screwed. >> Tribal Council was very"
46,00:03:29.37,00:03:29.37,"interesting, based upon a last-minute decision"
47,00:03:33.87,00:03:33.87,to get rid of T. Jon made an agreement that he
48,00:03:37.60,00:03:37.60,"would take Sandra and I to the  top four, along with Burton."
49,00:03:42.10,00:03:42.10,>> I'll just see what I can do. >> I don't know whether or not

52,00:03:51.53,00:03:51.53,for you guys is doubt. Christa made me swear on my
53,00:03:54.97,00:03:54.97,grandmother's grave that I would carry Christa and Sandra
54,00:03:57.37,00:03:57.37,to the final four. And I-I believe I used
55,00:04:01.00,00:04:01.00,the phrase before: Promises are like
56,00:04:03.00,00:04:03.00,wicker furniture and fat women: easily broken by Jonny Fairplay.
57,00:04:10.60,00:04:10.60,I've rolled the dice a lot in this game.
58,00:04:12.37,00:04:12.37,">> Don't go rolling it on me. >> Look, I'm happy now."
59,00:04:14.57,00:04:14.57,Don't make me unhappy. Let's just ride this thing out
60,00:04:16.60,00:04:16.60,to final four; we'll be fine. >> All right.
61,00:04:19.13,00:04:19.13,I really hope he's telling us the truth.
62,00:04:21.50,00:04:21.50,Probably not. I don't know.
63,00:04:24.03,00:04:24.03,I think that Sandra and I have a better chance
64,00:04:26.93,00:04:26.93,"of getting ahead with four women than Burton,"
65,00:04:29.13,00:04:29.13,"Jon, myself and Sandra. >> Are you ready?"
66,00:04:33.90,00:04:33.90,>> Yeah. We don't have to bring
67,00:04:36.17,00:04:36.17,"a thousand woods, right? Just one, quick, dry wood run."
68,00:04:39.93,00:04:39.93,"Me and Christa, we've been tight since, like,"
69,00:04:42.17,00:04:42.17,"day number two or three. But without Darrah right now,"
70,00:04:45.37,00:04:45.37,I can't move another step. I can't take another step
71,00:04:48.43,00:04:48.43,without knowing where Darrah stands right now.
72,00:04:51.20,00:04:51.20,She voted for Burton last night. She shouldn't have a problem
73,00:04:54.20,00:04:54.20,voting for him either tomorrow or the next day.
74,00:04:56.60,00:04:56.60,The deal we made yesterday to save Burton's skin
75,00:04:59.87,00:04:59.87,"was that you or Lill would go first,"
76,00:05:02.20,00:05:02.20,"but it didn't matter to us who went when, right?"
77,00:05:04.43,00:05:04.43,">> Mm-hmm. >> Now, I want the guys to go."
78,00:05:07.10,00:05:07.10,">> Yeah, yeah. >> You understand what I'm"
79,00:05:08.50,00:05:08.50,saying? >> Yeah. Uh-huh.
80,00:05:09.43,00:05:09.43,>> You think that'll work? >> Yeah.
81,00:05:11.23,00:05:11.23,Sandra's already talked to me this morning.
82,00:05:13.77,00:05:13.77,"I mean, I'm sure there'll be a bunch of different ones coming"
83,00:05:15.57,00:05:15.57,"up to me, trying to sway votes and stuff."
84,00:05:17.60,00:05:17.60,"So, I'm just going to play it, you know, let them come up to"
85,00:05:20.77,00:05:20.77,"me and see what's going on. And then, I'll decide what I"
86,00:05:23.53,00:05:23.53,need to do after that. >> I still think that Burton
87,00:05:25.93,00:05:25.93,"is a bigger threat than Jon. >> I do, too."
88,00:05:28.27,00:05:28.27,">> Then, we'll get Jon on the next shot because Jon is just"
89,00:05:30.87,00:05:30.87,like a girl. >> Right.
90,00:06:04.50,00:06:04.50,>> Wait till you see what's in the bag.
91,00:06:08.87,00:06:08.87,">> Oh, my goodness. >> Oh, Big Daddy."
92,00:06:12.50,00:06:12.50,>> Should we save some for lunch?
93,00:06:14.70,00:06:14.70,">> Yeah, I'm cool with whatever. >> We got mail."
94,00:06:17.37,00:06:17.37,">> Come read it over here. >> ""It's nice to be pampered."
95,00:06:21.10,00:06:21.10,"For you, it's been a while. Refresh yourself inside and out."
96,00:06:24.47,00:06:24.47,"We're talking life and style. This luxurious reward,"
97,00:06:26.87,00:06:26.87,"you'll really want to get. But if you move too slowly,"

193,00:12:39.70,00:12:39.70,">> Yep, there's our island. >> It sure is."
194,00:12:44.30,00:12:44.30,>> I wish it was me. >> ( Jon speaks inaudibly )
195,00:12:54.20,00:12:54.20,>> It is so gorgeous. It was a breathtaking view.
196,00:12:56.67,00:12:56.67,It was something that I'm not going to forget
197,00:12:59.07,00:12:59.07,for a long time. >> We've only seen
198,00:13:02.20,00:13:02.20,the Pearl Islands via our boat. Words can't describe
199,00:13:05.50,00:13:05.50,"how big this place is. I mean, there's just ocean,"
200,00:13:08.20,00:13:08.20,"ocean, ocean, ocean, and the biggest islands"
201,00:13:09.80,00:13:09.80,you've ever seen and the smallest islands
202,00:13:11.33,00:13:11.33,you've ever seen. There was just so many of them
203,00:13:13.47,00:13:13.47,everywhere. >> That was fabulous.
204,00:13:19.30,00:13:19.30,"( cheerful scream ) >> Oh, wow."
205,00:13:22.17,00:13:22.17,">> Oh, my gosh! Look at this!"
206,00:13:25.13,00:13:25.13,>> We had no idea how cool the hotel would be.
207,00:13:28.43,00:13:28.43,"And when we got here, it's, uh... this is absolute paradise."
208,00:13:32.90,00:13:32.90,">> Oh, my God! >> The room is huge."
209,00:13:36.30,00:13:36.30,"There was a big living room, a huge bedroom,"
210,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,"a big bathroom, mirrors. >> Whoo!"
211,00:13:41.87,00:13:41.87,>> ( screams ) >> Wow.
212,00:13:44.13,00:13:44.13,">> Oh, my gosh... >> It's not me!"
213,00:13:46.13,00:13:46.13,>> Look at my eyebrows. >> That first look at myself
214,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,"in a mirror was so shocking. Oh, my gosh!"
215,00:13:53.93,00:13:53.93,>> I have lost so much weight. >> I hadn't seen myself for...
216,00:13:57.33,00:13:57.33,30-some days. >> Shower.
217,00:14:00.97,00:14:00.97,">> Shower! >> Oh, this feels so good."
218,00:14:06.13,00:14:06.13,">> We might tell D she's, uh... she's top three, just to keep"
219,00:14:12.60,00:14:12.60,her from jumping. >> I won't say a word.
220,00:14:15.93,00:14:15.93,">> This was, bar none, the greatest reward we could be"
221,00:14:18.80,00:14:18.80,"given at this stage of the game. It gave me a chance, personally,"
222,00:14:23.20,00:14:23.20,"to talk with D and Lill without, uh, worrying about, uh,"
223,00:14:26.93,00:14:26.93,"Sandra and Christa overhearing, and gave me a chance to, uh,"
224,00:14:31.03,00:14:31.03,"heal up some of my, uh, war wounds from the first, uh,"
225,00:14:33.50,00:14:33.50,"30-plus days. >> Oh, baby."
226,00:14:44.23,00:14:44.23,The masseuse put cucumbers over my eyes.
227,00:14:46.97,00:14:46.97,I guess they do something for the skin.
228,00:14:49.40,00:14:49.40,I think I needed a whole cucumber to do anything for my
229,00:14:51.93,00:14:51.93,"my skin. >> Oh, this is the best."
230,00:14:54.60,00:14:54.60,"The Pearl Islands are paradise. However, it sucks with the bugs."
231,00:14:59.57,00:14:59.57,It sucks with some of the people.
232,00:15:02.13,00:15:02.13,It sucks with the food. Yeah.
233,00:15:04.90,00:15:04.90,">> Oh! >> Here, this is paradise and"
234,00:15:08.10,00:15:08.10,"that's an awesome feeling. >> Oh, my gosh, this lady is"
235,00:15:11.00,00:15:11.00,good. >> I feel sorry for Burton
236,00:15:13.60,00:15:13.60,today. >> Hope this doesn't have
237,00:15:20.43,00:15:20.43,"to be a clean fillet, 'cause I am shredding"
238,00:15:23.70,00:15:23.70,this thing. >> Did Jon talk to you
239,00:15:25.13,00:15:25.13,about everything? You're not going
240,00:15:26.37,00:15:26.37,"to screw us over? >> No, I haven't."
241,00:15:28.20,00:15:28.20,I haven't even talked to him about anything.
242,00:15:30.57,00:15:30.57,"Jon said, if we saved you, that Darrah and Lill would go."
243,00:15:34.33,00:15:34.33,">> Okay! I, I haven't even talked to Jon."
244,00:15:36.47,00:15:36.47,He just said... >> Jon told us the wrong thing.
245,00:15:39.47,00:15:39.47,He said that we'd be in the final four;
246,00:15:41.07,00:15:41.07,it would be two and two-- you and him and Sandra and I.
247,00:15:44.13,00:15:44.13,">> I'm in... I'm in a bit of an odd position right now,"
248,00:15:47.23,00:15:47.23,in that I am alone in the camp with Sandra and Christa.
249,00:15:50.57,00:15:50.57,"And I haven't talked to Jon fully about this, so I don't"
250,00:15:53.37,00:15:53.37,"know what to tell them. I mean, I've lied to them"
251,00:15:55.50,00:15:55.50,enough. I guess I could continue to lie.
252,00:15:57.97,00:15:57.97,"But at the same time, I don't want to piss them off,"
253,00:15:59.93,00:15:59.93,because they're going to be on the jury
254,00:16:01.40,00:16:01.40,and I want to be the one they vote for.
255,00:16:04.30,00:16:04.30,We all came together and we both saved each other.
256,00:16:06.97,00:16:06.97,"Well, if Christa wasn't on the chopping block,"
257,00:16:09.03,00:16:09.03,it'd be one thing. You didn't make that
258,00:16:11.23,00:16:11.23,voting decision to save me. >> Burton has never been one
259,00:16:15.57,00:16:15.57,to talk to me and Christa clearly about anything.
260,00:16:18.43,00:16:18.43,But let it be known that if it wasn't for me
261,00:16:20.67,00:16:20.67,"and Christa, Burton would not be here today."
262,00:16:23.07,00:16:23.07,You would think that that would count for something.
263,00:16:26.63,00:16:26.63,"And then here he is saying that he, he can't promise us"
264,00:16:29.60,00:16:29.60,third and fourth. That's a bunch of baloney.
265,00:16:31.93,00:16:31.93,"The first chance I get to send him home,"
266,00:16:33.20,00:16:33.20,he's going home. >> It's just hard to tell.
267,00:16:36.33,00:16:36.33,I can't tell when people lie anymore.
268,00:16:38.07,00:16:38.07,"Like, people can tell when I'm lying."
269,00:16:39.57,00:16:39.57,"I'm looking at them just like... >> Well, the thing"
270,00:16:41.47,00:16:41.47,"is around here is, like... just, everyone's lying"
271,00:16:43.13,00:16:43.13,to everyone. The only time you know
272,00:16:44.70,00:16:44.70,where someone stands is when they vote
273,00:16:46.10,00:16:46.10,at Tribal Council. The conversation that Sandra
274,00:16:47.70,00:16:47.70,and I had with Burton was a real eye-opener for me.
275,00:16:52.33,00:16:52.33,"It was, uh... I saw the light suddenly."
276,00:16:54.20,00:16:54.20,">> I mean, no matter how strong your best friend is out here,"
277,00:16:56.37,00:16:56.37,"at the end of the day, it's not as strong as"
278,00:16:59.10,00:16:59.10,"a million dollars. >> At this point, it's every man"
279,00:17:01.80,00:17:01.80,"for themselves, I see it. We're not here"
280,00:17:05.27,00:17:05.27,to make best friends. We're not here to do anything
281,00:17:07.70,00:17:07.70,like that. We're here to play a game
282,00:17:09.70,00:17:09.70,and get as far as we can. >> Ooh!
283,00:17:17.47,00:17:17.47,"Oh, we got pajamas. >> No way."
284,00:17:19.93,00:17:19.93,"( Lill squeals ): Oh, you're kidding!"
285,00:17:21.67,00:17:21.67,">> Oh, they're silk. >> Oh, my God."
286,00:17:24.27,00:17:24.27,">> On our bed was silky pajamas. We put them on, pranced around,"
287,00:17:29.93,00:17:29.93,showed them off. This is so exciting.
288,00:17:33.37,00:17:33.37,>> This is so wonderful. >> I think we have a table
289,00:17:38.67,00:17:38.67,"for three. >> When we got to dinner,"
290,00:17:40.70,00:17:40.70,"I was starving. And I, I..."
291,00:17:42.40,00:17:42.40,It was so nice to be able to open a menu up
292,00:17:44.53,00:17:44.53,and to be able to read. I did remember how to read
293,00:17:47.37,00:17:47.37,after all this time. My mouth is watering.
294,00:17:50.77,00:17:50.77,>> Chicken fingers will definitely be
295,00:17:52.07,00:17:52.07,a good appetizer. >> What about the clam?
296,00:17:54.60,00:17:54.60,">> Lill, you really want to do clam"
297,00:17:56.70,00:17:56.70,after 31 days of eating nothing but seafood?
298,00:17:59.17,00:17:59.17,"I'll order for you guys. For dinner, she would like"
299,00:18:02.60,00:18:02.60,the filet mignon. >> I love a man that takes over.
300,00:18:05.10,00:18:05.10,">> Me, too. >> How would you like"
301,00:18:06.97,00:18:06.97,"that prepared? >> Um, medium rare."
302,00:18:08.30,00:18:08.30,>> Medium rare. >> Jon ordered all the food
303,00:18:10.00,00:18:10.00,for all of us. I enjoyed that.
304,00:18:12.13,00:18:12.13,"You know, I, I like when a guy takes the initiative."
305,00:18:15.23,00:18:15.23,"Rock and roll, man. Rock and roll."
306,00:18:17.43,00:18:17.43,I'm a great date. I have a pretty extensive
307,00:18:19.93,00:18:19.93,"fine food knowledge, and I was able to show that off."
308,00:18:22.30,00:18:22.30,"( Lill gasps ) >> Oh, my goodness."
309,00:18:24.80,00:18:24.80,"Oh, my... What's that?"
310,00:18:26.23,00:18:26.23,>> That's bruschetta. >> You're a whole lot more
311,00:18:28.93,00:18:28.93,smarter than me. >> There's a few more sides
312,00:18:31.20,00:18:31.20,to Jonny Fairplay than these girls
313,00:18:33.17,00:18:33.17,"had any clue about. And as Lill said, I'm much more"
314,00:18:35.90,00:18:35.90,than just a pretty face. I have noticed Sandra and
315,00:18:43.87,00:18:43.87,Christa will never give me a vote.
316,00:18:46.60,00:18:46.60,>> Out in the water... >> Yeah.
317,00:18:49.53,00:18:49.53,">> ...they said to me, ""We're going to kick out Jon"
318,00:18:51.90,00:18:51.90,"""and we're going to kick out, um, Burton."
319,00:18:53.90,00:18:53.90,">> Are you with us?"" When we were eating,"
320,00:18:57.87,00:18:57.87,we talked a lot about what's been going on behind the scenes.
321,00:19:02.70,00:19:02.70,I know that Jon had to promise Christa and Sandra a lot
322,00:19:07.37,00:19:07.37,in order for them to back us up to get rid of T.
323,00:19:10.30,00:19:10.30,I had to promise on my grandmother to them.
324,00:19:12.07,00:19:12.07,"Oh, no, no, no, no! Don't do that."
325,00:19:13.83,00:19:13.83,I had to. She's looking down here at you.
326,00:19:16.33,00:19:16.33,I know. She'll forgive me.
327,00:19:19.03,00:19:19.03,"I had so much fun in explaining to, uh, D and Lill that,"
328,00:19:22.03,00:19:22.03,"uh, Christa made me swear on my grandmother's grave."
329,00:19:25.00,00:19:25.00,And I told Lill that it upset me so much to have to do that.
330,00:19:28.53,00:19:28.53,"And I was like, ""One of her last wishes was that,"
331,00:19:31.07,00:19:31.07,"that I win."" ( laughing )"
332,00:19:38.70,00:19:38.70,( laughing ) Lill is very antsy
333,00:19:45.47,00:19:45.47,"and there was lots of strategy that we needed to go over, uh,"
334,00:19:51.43,00:19:51.43,for the last stage of the game. There's a lot of people
335,00:19:54.37,00:19:54.37,"worried about you, Lill. >> Why?"
336,00:19:55.73,00:19:55.73,>> Because. Who whispered this
337,00:19:57.60,00:19:57.60,morning that like... >> Lill is the queen of sitting
338,00:20:00.90,00:20:00.90,around the camp going... >> I am not!
339,00:20:05.40,00:20:05.40,">> Yes, you are. I am not!"
340,00:20:07.37,00:20:07.37,">> You hurt my feelings... >> Lill, I'm going to keep"
341,00:20:11.30,00:20:11.30,hurting your feelings unless you start
342,00:20:12.50,00:20:12.50,telling the truth. >> I'm going to bed.
343,00:20:14.43,00:20:14.43,">> Lill, that's not helping anything."
344,00:20:16.23,00:20:16.23,>> I'm going to bed. You hurt my feelings.
345,00:20:18.30,00:20:18.30,">> Lill, you're... you're doing more damage"
346,00:20:20.00,00:20:20.00,"than anything. >> Lill, get in here."
347,00:20:21.93,00:20:21.93,We got stuff to talk about. >> Jon talks down to me
348,00:20:25.10,00:20:25.10,"like I'm some idiot. Lill, it's the truth."
349,00:20:28.70,00:20:28.70,Make me sound like a big-mouth.
350,00:20:30.17,00:20:30.17,It is not the truth. He wants to show
351,00:20:32.30,00:20:32.30,"that he's in charge and... you know, I've seen that before."
352,00:20:35.37,00:20:35.37,And I'm thinking that may be his way
353,00:20:37.90,00:20:37.90,of separating himself from me. ( thunder crashing )
354,00:20:53.97,00:20:53.97,">> So, I was thinking about Darrah."
355,00:20:55.60,00:20:55.60,"I tell you, after that that challenge, I fear her"
356,00:20:57.93,00:20:57.93,"most in something like that, 'cause I think she has"
357,00:21:00.40,00:21:00.40,a good chance of winning. >> Yep. Watch your step on here.
358,00:21:02.90,00:21:02.90,">> This morning, Christa and I went out looking for mussels"
359,00:21:05.37,00:21:05.37,"to eat. And she brought up a strategy,"
360,00:21:07.27,00:21:07.27,"again, what I was thinking. But she is willing"
361,00:21:10.43,00:21:10.43,"to make concessions, and she's looking, um,"
362,00:21:12.17,00:21:12.17,"to get farther in the game. So, it's a good thing to know."
363,00:21:17.17,00:21:17.17,"Well, let me ask you this... Without having talked to Jon,"
364,00:21:19.87,00:21:19.87,I have no idea what's going on. >> But...
365,00:21:22.50,00:21:22.50,>> But... would you vote Sandra out next if that was the case?
366,00:21:26.80,00:21:26.80,">> I would go along with it, if that's what you guys"
367,00:21:28.87,00:21:28.87,wanted me to do and get rid of her first.
368,00:21:30.60,00:21:30.60,"But from a strategic standpoint,"
369,00:21:33.57,00:21:33.57,and just seeing how Darrah is most likely
370,00:21:36.17,00:21:36.17,"to win immunity... I mean, I know that it's"
371,00:21:38.83,00:21:38.83,"probably not going to be something super physical,"
372,00:21:40.53,00:21:40.53,but Darrah was a cheerleader and she can hang in
373,00:21:43.40,00:21:43.40,"for long periods of time, you know?"
374,00:21:45.13,00:21:45.13,Right. >> Nothing Christa said this
375,00:21:48.17,00:21:48.17,morning really surprised me. I had a feeling she would
376,00:21:49.87,00:21:49.87,stab Sandra in the back if she needed to.
377,00:21:52.63,00:21:52.63,She does really want Darrah to go first.
378,00:21:55.47,00:21:55.47,"All the options are still open, but it might not be bad"
379,00:21:59.57,00:21:59.57,to have Christa in the top four. Because if Jon did do
380,00:22:02.43,00:22:02.43,"something funny, um, I'm pretty sure I could beat"
381,00:22:05.37,00:22:05.37,Christa at Tribal Council. I think she's rubbed a lot
382,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,of people the wrong way. I would like to see you
383,00:22:09.30,00:22:09.30,in the top four. I really want to go
384,00:22:11.07,00:22:11.07,to the top four. And I will do what I can
385,00:22:13.87,00:22:13.87,"to get you there. So, you..."
386,00:22:15.87,00:22:15.87,you got my word on that. >> I think that Burton
387,00:22:18.87,00:22:18.87,"understands that this is a game, and we're all trying"
388,00:22:21.17,00:22:21.17,to get ahead. Me stabbing Sandra in the back
389,00:22:23.53,00:22:23.53,and getting rid of her... isn't anything personal.
390,00:22:27.73,00:22:27.73,It's nothing about that. It's about getting farther ahead
391,00:22:31.00,00:22:31.00,and doing the right thing to win this game.
392,00:22:50.40,00:22:50.40,">> Good morning. >> This morning,"
393,00:22:52.57,00:22:52.57,"we awoke to a big, fresh pot of coffee and, uh, bacon, eggs,"
394,00:22:58.87,00:22:58.87,"the most amazing banana nut bread on the planet,"
395,00:23:02.07,00:23:02.07,"fresh O.J, fresh fruit. Great way to start the day"
396,00:23:05.93,00:23:05.93,and yet another advantage that we have over the others
397,00:23:09.07,00:23:09.07,going into the final. >> I see Survivor as a big game
398,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63,of human chess. I felt that I could feed off
399,00:23:22.90,00:23:22.90,"Darrah's greed and basically say, ""Hey, look, you know,"
400,00:23:25.30,00:23:25.30,"there's no way anyone can beat Lill in a jury."""
401,00:23:28.30,00:23:28.30,"And she agreed. I was like, you know, ""So,"
402,00:23:30.00,00:23:30.00,"""without, uh, without anyone knowing, how about me and"
403,00:23:32.70,00:23:32.70,"you Final Two?"" And she did"
404,00:23:34.60,00:23:34.60,"the math in her head, and she was, like,"
405,00:23:35.93,00:23:35.93,"""I think you're exactly right."" >> Okay."
406,00:23:39.67,00:23:39.67,I won't say anything else about it.
407,00:23:43.87,00:23:43.87,>> It's going to be me and... and Jon in the Final Two.
408,00:23:46.20,00:23:46.20,"I mean, Jon, you know, he's a snake."
409,00:23:47.80,00:23:47.80,"He lies, but... he also tells the truth, too."
410,00:23:50.63,00:23:50.63,"And, I don't... I know he's not sitting here"
411,00:23:53.00,00:23:53.00,lying to me about going to the Final Two.
412,00:24:06.30,00:24:06.30,>> I want to know everything. Start from when
413,00:24:08.80,00:24:08.80,"the boat left... >> When Jon, Lill and Darrah"
414,00:24:11.67,00:24:11.67,"returned from the reward, I was happy to see them,"
415,00:24:14.07,00:24:14.07,because I was glad the reward was over for them.
416,00:24:16.77,00:24:16.77,I'm still jealous. But I wanted to hear everything.
417,00:24:19.80,00:24:19.80,I want to hear everything from the beginning to the end.
418,00:24:22.27,00:24:22.27,">> All right, so, let me... We'll start at the beginning."
419,00:24:23.93,00:24:23.93,"Big bed, enough for three people,"
420,00:24:26.53,00:24:26.53,"shower, commode, toothbrush, shampoo..."
421,00:24:30.63,00:24:30.63,>> (screams) >> I wanted to kind of
422,00:24:32.77,00:24:32.77,"play it down a little bit, but he told them"
423,00:24:35.17,00:24:35.17,"every detail there was. And I thought, ""Well, okay."
424,00:24:38.07,00:24:38.07,"It's not me telling it and bragging on it."""
425,00:24:41.40,00:24:41.40,"Filet mignon, cheeseburger, another filet mignon."
426,00:24:45.60,00:24:45.60,>> Bastard! >> We ate for four hours.
427,00:24:49.23,00:24:49.23,( Jon laughing ) >> Get out.
428,00:24:51.43,00:24:51.43,">> Jon, please tell me you're at least hung over."
429,00:24:55.00,00:24:55.00,"Well, they're taking it pretty good."
430,00:24:58.03,00:24:58.03,">> But, um... >> All a front."
431,00:24:59.77,00:24:59.77,"All a front. >> So, what did you"
432,00:25:04.47,00:25:04.47,guys talk about? >> Everything's set.
433,00:25:09.13,00:25:09.13,"I told Lill ""top three"" wh-when Darrah"
434,00:25:12.27,00:25:12.27,"was in the shower. I told D,"
435,00:25:15.37,00:25:15.37,"""There's no way we can beat Lill or, uh, Burton in a jury."""
436,00:25:20.57,00:25:20.57,"I was, like, ""So, it's me and you."""
437,00:25:21.97,00:25:21.97,"She goes, ""I was thinking the exact same thing."""
438,00:25:24.17,00:25:24.17,">> After talking to Jon, it sounds like he did a great job,"
439,00:25:27.83,00:25:27.83,"basically promising Lill and Darrah, um, enough"
440,00:25:32.30,00:25:32.30,so that they should never break this alliance.
441,00:25:35.23,00:25:35.23,"I'm not worried about D, and I'm not worried about Lill."
442,00:25:38.23,00:25:38.23,">> Well, then, who's next? >> Huh?"
443,00:25:40.43,00:25:40.43,>> Who's next? >> Christa's next.
444,00:25:42.10,00:25:42.10,">> So, you're going to blindside Christa?"
445,00:25:43.47,00:25:43.47,>> Yeah. >> Okay.
446,00:25:49.37,00:25:49.37,">> Is that cool with you? >> Yeah, I mean..."
447,00:25:51.90,00:25:51.90,Why are you flip-flopping on Christa?
448,00:25:53.50,00:25:53.50,"No, no. I'm not flip-flopping."
449,00:25:54.87,00:25:54.87,>> You can't be nice on any of these screwing-over
450,00:25:57.63,00:25:57.63,"people, you know? Like, we both have"
451,00:25:59.57,00:25:59.57,"to be equally as evil. >> Yeah. Dude, we're both..."
452,00:26:01.70,00:26:01.70,>> Okay. >> My strategy at this point in
453,00:26:04.90,00:26:04.90,"the game is to work with Jon. Jon's the bad cop,"
454,00:26:07.27,00:26:07.27,I'm the good cop. As we kick these people
455,00:26:09.83,00:26:09.83,"out of the game, if it all works as planned,"
456,00:26:12.37,00:26:12.37,they will be mad at Jon and not me.
457,00:26:15.07,00:26:15.07,"Assuming nothing changes, you and I are guaranteed top"
458,00:26:17.47,00:26:17.47,two. >> I know.
459,00:26:18.73,00:26:18.73,">> So, neither of us will change. "
460,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,">> That's... it's a guarantee. >> Oh, man..."
461,00:26:43.47,00:26:43.47,I just want to sleep. ( mutters )
462,00:26:47.27,00:26:47.27,This game runs my life 24 hours a day.
463,00:26:50.43,00:26:50.43,>> I know it does. >> I've had two dreams
464,00:26:52.67,00:26:52.67,since I've been here that weren't related
465,00:26:54.53,00:26:54.53,"to the game. >> Are you still,"
466,00:26:56.30,00:26:56.30,"you know, I'm asking... Are you still thinking"
467,00:26:59.37,00:26:59.37,that we're the Final Two? >> I'm really not thinking.
468,00:27:03.67,00:27:03.67,I... don't want to think that far in advance.
469,00:27:06.27,00:27:06.27,"Okay, you're telling me now that you've had second thoughts."
470,00:27:09.40,00:27:09.40,That's not true. I think
471,00:27:11.50,00:27:11.50,"two Tribal Councils in advance. >> Last night, I couldn't sleep."
472,00:27:17.03,00:27:17.03,And I got up and went to the fire.
473,00:27:18.97,00:27:18.97,"I asked him, ""So, are you still comfortable with this..."
474,00:27:22.20,00:27:22.20,"you and I at the end?"" And he said, ""Let's just do"
475,00:27:25.47,00:27:25.47,"one at a time."" >> I can't help but feeling"
476,00:27:29.40,00:27:29.40,you're having second thoughts. ( muttering indistinctly )
477,00:27:32.73,00:27:32.73,">> Yeah, but Lill, that's in your head."
478,00:27:35.37,00:27:35.37,I'm not having thoughts. >> Okay. All right.
479,00:27:39.10,00:27:39.10,I just want to be prepared
480,00:27:40.63,00:27:40.63,that I know where I stand. I am not going to screw you
481,00:27:45.17,00:27:45.17,"over, okay? >> Okay."
482,00:27:48.77,00:27:48.77,What I have told Lill is that I will never lie
483,00:27:52.30,00:27:52.30,to her in this game. I told her I'd take her as far
484,00:27:54.80,00:27:54.80,as I could. And I do have
485,00:27:56.13,00:27:56.13,"an allegiance with her, and I do have an alliance with her."
486,00:27:58.70,00:27:58.70,But I have never promised her top two.
487,00:28:00.63,00:28:00.63,">> Well, I have a feeling I'd better make immunity, then."
488,00:28:06.13,00:28:06.13,">> It ticks me a little bit. Matter of fact, it pisses me off"
489,00:28:09.03,00:28:09.03,"a little bit, but... what can I do about it?"
490,00:28:11.63,00:28:11.63,Um... the only thing that would save me is to
491,00:28:14.47,00:28:14.47,win immunity at the end. Then that may even justify me
492,00:28:17.97,00:28:17.97,"to turn my back on him. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
493,00:28:36.80,00:28:36.80,"All right, let's get to today's immunity challenge."
494,00:28:40.03,00:28:40.03,"Darrah, give it up. Nice to have it on, isn't it?"
495,00:28:43.07,00:28:43.07,">> Yeah, it feels good. >> Immunity back up for grabs."
496,00:28:49.27,00:28:49.27,"For today's immunity challenge, you will fire traditional"
497,00:28:52.60,00:28:52.60,pirate muskets. They've been modified
498,00:28:54.60,00:28:54.60,to shoot flares. You'll be shooting at targets.
499,00:28:58.17,00:28:58.17,You each have three targets. First person
500,00:28:59.73,00:28:59.73,to hit all three targets wins immunity.
501,00:29:03.50,00:29:03.50,"Everybody else, vulnerable at tonight's Tribal Council."
502,00:29:07.83,00:29:07.83,"Take your spots. Wait for my ""Go."""
503,00:29:14.47,00:29:14.47,"First three: Christa, Lill and Sandra."
504,00:29:19.37,00:29:19.37,"Christa, you're up first. Ever shot a gun before?"
505,00:29:22.63,00:29:22.63,>> Never shot a gun in my entire life.
506,00:29:24.20,00:29:24.20,>> PROBST: Let me... let me give you a hand.
507,00:29:26.37,00:29:26.37,"Yeah, put this hand... under here, right"
508,00:29:27.93,00:29:27.93,"under here, like you're... There you go."
509,00:29:30.03,00:29:30.03,"And you're gonna pull this back, and"
510,00:29:31.90,00:29:31.90,then you're gonna fire the trigger.
511,00:29:37.63,00:29:37.63,">> PROBST: Look at that. First time she shoots a gun,"
512,00:29:40.63,00:29:40.63,hits her target. One target down for Christa.
513,00:29:43.67,00:29:43.67,>> Nice shot. >> PROBST: Lill.
514,00:29:49.73,00:29:49.73,Little low. Sandra.
515,00:29:55.60,00:29:55.60,Little low. Step back.
516,00:29:58.00,00:29:58.00,"Next three, step in. Jon, Darrah"
517,00:29:59.83,00:29:59.83,and Burton. Jon... looking
518,00:30:03.20,00:30:03.20,for your first target. Just a little to the left.
519,00:30:08.00,00:30:08.00,">> ( sighs ) >> PROBST: All right, Darrah,"
520,00:30:10.23,00:30:10.23,show them how it's done. I know you want immunity again.
521,00:30:14.37,00:30:14.37,Darrah connects. On the board with her first
522,00:30:17.13,00:30:17.13,target. Nice shooting.
523,00:30:20.00,00:30:20.00,Burton. Nails his first target
524,00:30:25.00,00:30:25.00,on his first hit. End of the first round...
525,00:30:27.90,00:30:27.90,"Christa has one hit, Burton has one hit,"
526,00:30:31.40,00:30:31.40,"Darrah has one hit. Next three, up."
527,00:30:33.93,00:30:33.93,Everybody rotate one position to your right.
528,00:30:36.90,00:30:36.90,"Sandra, looking for your first hit."
529,00:30:40.77,00:30:40.77,Takes her aim. Fires a little low.
530,00:30:45.93,00:30:45.93,"Christa, looking for your second target."
531,00:30:50.37,00:30:50.37,Look at that. Christa nails another target.
532,00:30:52.23,00:30:52.23,Two for two. Lill takes her aim.
533,00:30:57.53,00:30:57.53,Lill just low again. Step back.
534,00:31:00.83,00:31:00.83,"Next three, up. Burton, hit your target"
535,00:31:03.13,00:31:03.13,"on your first shot. Burton with his second shot,"
536,00:31:06.93,00:31:06.93,looking for a second target to stay tight with Christa.
537,00:31:12.13,00:31:12.13,"And he just misses, just low. Jon, looking for his first hit."
538,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,"Jon low. All right, Darrah."
539,00:31:22.30,00:31:22.30,Looking for your second hit. And she does.
540,00:31:25.77,00:31:25.77,Good shot. Darrah on the board
541,00:31:28.13,00:31:28.13,with two targets. Step back.
542,00:31:29.40,00:31:29.40,"Next three, up. Here's where we're at:"
543,00:31:31.53,00:31:31.53,"Christa on the board with two hits,"
544,00:31:33.77,00:31:33.77,"Darrah with two hits, Burton with one."
545,00:31:36.07,00:31:36.07,"Christa, looking for her third and final target."
546,00:31:41.80,00:31:41.80,"Oh! >> Damn, I was happy for you."
547,00:31:44.53,00:31:44.53,>> Wow. Hit the wood. That was close.
548,00:31:45.63,00:31:45.63,">> PROBST: Hit the wood. Close, but no cigar."
549,00:31:49.20,00:31:49.20,Lill connects. Lill on the board.
550,00:31:56.40,00:31:56.40,"Sandra with her first hit, on the board with one."
551,00:31:59.97,00:31:59.97,Here's where we're at: Christa on the board
552,00:32:02.13,00:32:02.13,"with two hits, Darrah with two hits,"
553,00:32:04.03,00:32:04.03,"Lill, Sandra, Burton each with one."
554,00:32:07.63,00:32:07.63,"Darrah, looking for her third and final target."
555,00:32:09.93,00:32:09.93,"If she hits it, she'll win immunity."
556,00:32:14.50,00:32:14.50,And she hits it. Whoo! Darrah has hit
557,00:32:17.07,00:32:17.07,all three targets. Darrah wins immunity
558,00:32:19.47,00:32:19.47,for the second time. Get up here.
559,00:32:24.23,00:32:24.23,"Once again, the smallest girl"
560,00:32:26.10,00:32:26.10,"out here is the safest. The other five of you,"
561,00:32:29.00,00:32:29.00,somebody going home. Head back to your camp.
562,00:32:31.33,00:32:31.33,I'll see you guys at the Tribal Council.
563,00:32:56.37,00:32:56.37,">> Congratulations, Darrah. >> Deadeye Darrah."
564,00:33:00.23,00:33:00.23,">> I almost won immunity. I almost, almost always"
565,00:33:03.43,00:33:03.43,"win immunity, but that's never good enough."
566,00:33:06.07,00:33:06.07,"I feel absolutely vulnerable. You know,"

569,00:33:14.67,00:33:14.67,I'm sure we can turn the tables again.

571,00:33:17.93,00:33:17.93,I'm going to go home. I feel like
572,00:33:19.43,00:33:19.43,I'm going to go home now. You got saved once.
573,00:33:21.53,00:33:21.53,"You're about to get saved again. >> We want Burton gone, because"
574,00:33:24.77,00:33:24.77,he's the strongest one out here.
575,00:33:26.53,00:33:26.53,"Although he hasn't won these immunities,"
576,00:33:28.40,00:33:28.40,"but that doesn't mean anything. Physically,"
577,00:33:30.07,00:33:30.07,"he's stronger than we are, and to put it all on an equal"
578,00:33:33.27,00:33:33.27,"playing field, we want all the females together"
579,00:33:35.37,00:33:35.37,till the end. Would you be willing
580,00:33:37.67,00:33:37.67,to vote him off tonight? >> Burton?
581,00:33:40.07,00:33:40.07,>> Yes or no? >> No.
582,00:33:42.27,00:33:42.27,">> No? You're going with who, with Lill?"
583,00:33:44.37,00:33:44.37,">> Yeah, I'm voting for Lill. So, Lill is it tonight?"
584,00:33:47.43,00:33:47.43,Mm-hmm? >> I just want to make sure
585,00:33:50.60,00:33:50.60,everybody was on the same sheet of music.
586,00:33:52.30,00:33:52.30,>> I think he's already telling her right now.
587,00:33:54.37,00:33:54.37,>> Really? I feel bad.
588,00:34:13.77,00:34:13.77,">> There's a word in the English language,"
589,00:34:16.03,00:34:16.03,"uh, called ""naive"" and, uh, some people are that,"
590,00:34:21.87,00:34:21.87,"and, obviously, those people are playing this game."
591,00:34:33.80,00:34:33.80,>> I'm being told that it's still Christa
592,00:34:35.77,00:34:35.77,"that will be leaving tonight, but that doesn't mean"
593,00:34:38.63,00:34:38.63,"that I can't, you know, organize my stuff, pack my shells."
594,00:34:43.40,00:34:43.40,Never take anything for granted. >> They're not going
595,00:34:51.10,00:34:51.10,to give up Lill. That's bull...
596,00:34:52.67,00:34:52.67,>> It would throw everything off.
597,00:34:55.17,00:34:55.17,They're not giving up Lill. Jon is a snake.
598,00:34:58.23,00:34:58.23,"Jon will never be anything other than a snake,"
599,00:35:00.37,00:35:00.37,"but the fact is that Christa keeps telling me,"

607,00:35:20.80,00:35:20.80,It's cutthroat. Everybody wants
608,00:35:22.47,00:35:22.47,to get to the end. Everybody wants to go
609,00:35:24.97,00:35:24.97,one more place. Lying is the way
610,00:35:27.00,00:35:27.00,"to go out here. Everybody has done it,"

616,00:36:10.97,00:36:10.97,"as we head into the six days. Jon, at this point in the game,"
617,00:36:14.77,00:36:14.77,"would you describe the game as ""friendly,"" ""mean,"""
618,00:36:16.57,00:36:16.57,"""competitive...?"" >> I would best describe"
619,00:36:22.33,00:36:22.33,"this point in time in the game as the most hope-filled,"
620,00:36:25.70,00:36:25.70,in which you have to hope that the people
621,00:36:29.07,00:36:29.07,that you're aligning yourself with are telling you
622,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,"the truth. Hope that you can outlast them,"
623,00:36:35.80,00:36:35.80,hope that you're carrying the right person to the end.
624,00:36:38.93,00:36:38.93,"Burton, do you think this game somehow gives you a license"
625,00:36:41.70,00:36:41.70,"to lie and betray and cheat? >> It's, it's part of the game."
626,00:36:45.43,00:36:45.43,You've got to deceive people. You have to make them think
627,00:36:47.87,00:36:47.87,"one thing and do another. I mean, it's just like any"
628,00:36:50.47,00:36:50.47,competitive game. You're trying to fake
629,00:36:52.07,00:36:52.07,"out the other team, and you're trying to get"
630,00:36:54.93,00:36:54.93,"farther at their expense. >> PROBST: Christa, have you"
631,00:36:56.80,00:36:56.80,lied in this game? >> Uh...
632,00:36:58.87,00:36:58.87,"I think I've lied a few times. Um, definitely, I've kind"
633,00:37:02.60,00:37:02.60,of tried to have this  philosophy from day one

641,00:37:23.57,00:37:23.57,"up against Lill would be suicidal, and, uh,"
642,00:37:26.70,00:37:26.70,she's the only one here that I...
643,00:37:28.23,00:37:28.23,"I feel like that about. Lill, does it worry"
644,00:37:30.87,00:37:30.87,you a little bit that you're the oldest
645,00:37:33.10,00:37:33.10,"Survivor out here, you represent the Boy Scout,"
646,00:37:36.20,00:37:36.20,"and everybody loves you, in a game in which"
647,00:37:38.87,00:37:38.87,you want to put yourself against somebody that people don't like?
648,00:37:42.03,00:37:42.03,"It worries, it worries me that the jury would"
649,00:37:45.40,00:37:45.40,base their decision on somebody that is nice.
650,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,"Um, there's more to it than nice; there's strategy there,"
651,00:37:51.30,00:37:51.30,not just something... someone that is nice.
652,00:37:54.47,00:37:54.47,">> PROBST: Christa, why not you tonight?"
653,00:37:57.47,00:37:57.47,">> Um,I think I've rubbed some people the wrong way..."
654,00:38:02.07,00:38:02.07,"a lot of people the wrong way, and that might be"
655,00:38:04.93,00:38:04.93,one reason that I might stick around tonight
656,00:38:08.37,00:38:08.37,"and not be voted off. >> PROBST: So, back"
657,00:38:10.67,00:38:10.67,"to the likability factor, it might help you tonight that a"
658,00:38:14.77,00:38:14.77,couple of people don't like you. Everything is completely
659,00:38:17.07,00:38:17.07,"unpredictable all the time, you know?"
660,00:38:19.63,00:38:19.63,"There's no trust here. It's all about hope, you know?"
661,00:38:22.80,00:38:22.80,"Jon, do you trust your relationships in this game--"
662,00:38:25.33,00:38:25.33,right now? >> Yes.
663,00:38:30.10,00:38:30.10,">> PROBST: Sandra, you trust your alliances?"
664,00:38:32.13,00:38:32.13,">> Yes. >> PROBST: Christa, how about"
665,00:38:34.63,00:38:34.63,you? >> Yes.
666,00:38:36.67,00:38:36.67,>> PROBST: Lill? >> Yes.
667,00:38:38.33,00:38:38.33,>> PROBST: Burton? >> Yeah.
668,00:38:39.20,00:38:39.20,>> PROBST: Darrah? >> Yes.
669,00:38:42.30,00:38:42.30,">> PROBST: So, we just sat here tonight and talked about"
670,00:38:44.40,00:38:44.40,"lying and betrayal and deceit, but you all trust"
671,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,your relationships. This is going to be interesting.
672,00:38:51.27,00:38:51.27,"Darrah, you're wearing immunity. Want to give it up?"
673,00:38:52.97,00:38:52.97,>> No. >> PROBST: She's keeping it.
674,00:38:54.63,00:38:54.63,Darrah's the only person you can't vote for.
675,00:38:56.47,00:38:56.47,You all trust each other. You have no idea what
676,00:38:58.53,00:38:58.53,the vote's gonna be. So let's find out.
677,00:39:00.67,00:39:00.67,"Jon, it is time to vote. You're up."
678,00:39:15.40,00:39:15.40,">> Whether you like it or don't like it, learn to love it,"
679,00:39:18.00,00:39:18.00,because it's the best thing going today.
680,00:39:19.87,00:39:19.87,"Whoo! >> Hopefully, everybody else"
681,00:39:34.03,00:39:34.03,is doing the same thing and voting for you.
682,00:39:54.00,00:39:54.00,>> You always treated me with kindness.
683,00:39:55.53,00:39:55.53,"Um, this is totally strategic, because I'd hate"
684,00:39:58.03,00:39:58.03,to go up against you. You're too much
685,00:40:00.07,00:40:00.07,of a kind person and I know they'd just
686,00:40:02.20,00:40:02.20,hand you the money and I can't and I can't have that happen.
687,00:40:04.50,00:40:04.50,Adios. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
688,00:40:12.70,00:40:12.70,"votes. Once the votes are read,"
689,00:40:28.20,00:40:28.20,the decision is final. The person voted out
690,00:40:30.57,00:40:30.57,will be asked to leave the Tribal Council
691,00:40:32.27,00:40:32.27,area immediately. I'll read the votes.
692,00:40:35.93,00:40:35.93,First vote... Christa.
693,00:40:43.73,00:40:43.73,"Lill. One vote Lill,"

695,00:40:51.13,00:40:51.13,"That's two votes Lill, one vote Christa."
696,00:40:56.33,00:40:56.33,Christa. Christa.
697,00:41:05.93,00:41:05.93,"Three votes Christa, two votes Lill."
698,00:41:11.17,00:41:11.17,11th person voted out of the tribe.
699,00:41:13.70,00:41:13.70,Christa. You need to bring me your torch.
700,00:41:26.50,00:41:26.50,"Christa, the tribe has spoken. You guys told me you trusted"
701,00:41:41.60,00:41:41.60,"your relationships, and yet, on the heels of Rupert and T.,"
702,00:41:45.30,00:41:45.30,a third surprising vote with only six days left and five
703,00:41:50.00,00:41:50.00,very clearly skilled liars still in it.
704,00:41:53.13,00:41:53.13,Should be a fun finish. You guys can get your torches.
