2,00:00:03.00,00:00:03.00,Survivor: 18 castaways were cut off from

6,00:00:20.08,00:00:20.08,...who systematically devoured the weak and struggling red
7,00:00:23.50,00:00:23.50,tribe Fang. >> It's tough having to deal
8,00:00:25.96,00:00:25.96,with the losses over and over again.
9,00:00:27.62,00:00:27.62,It starts to make you feel like you might not ever win.
10,00:00:30.33,00:00:30.33,>> PROBST: We are picking new tribes.
11,00:00:33.04,00:00:33.04,">> What?! >> No, no, no."
12,00:00:36.00,00:00:36.00,">> PROBST: On day ten, a tribe swap gave Fang the opportunity"
13,00:00:39.29,00:00:39.29,to improve themselves. >> I'm going to go with Kelly.
14,00:00:41.96,00:00:41.96,>> PROBST: But they continued to be their own worst enemy by
15,00:00:44.17,00:00:44.17,foolishly picking weak players over stronger ones.
16,00:00:47.04,00:00:47.04,That may be the most surprising decision in ten days out here.
17,00:00:51.33,00:00:51.33,"At the end of the tribe swap, Sugar, the pinup model, wasn't"
18,00:00:54.79,00:00:54.79,chosen and was sent on her second trip to Exile Island.
19,00:00:58.04,00:00:58.04,">> I already have the idol, so I chose comfort."
20,00:01:00.88,00:01:00.88,(chuckles) >> PROBST: At the immunity

23,00:01:07.83,00:01:07.83,>> PROBST: Randy scores for Kota!
24,00:01:09.21,00:01:09.21,...made every point in a 3-0 blowout of his old tribe.
25,00:01:12.25,00:01:12.25,"Kota wins immunity! By day 12, Fang had hit an"
26,00:01:15.92,00:01:15.92,all-time low. >> It was like we were legless
27,00:01:18.12,00:01:18.12,chickens racing against sleek weasels.
28,00:01:21.29,00:01:21.29,>> PROBST: And faced with the choice to vote out a strong
29,00:01:23.75,00:01:23.75,member-- Jacquie-- or a weak one-- Kelly-- they acted as
30,00:01:27.17,00:01:27.17,though they had a death wish and weakened their tribe yet again.
31,00:01:30.42,00:01:30.42,"Jacquie, the tribe has spoken. And Ace lost one of his closest"
32,00:01:34.62,00:01:34.62,allies. 14 are left.
33,00:01:37.21,00:01:37.21,Who will be voted out tonight? >> The whole tribal thing is a
34,00:01:52.88,00:01:52.88,"trip. >> Uh, sure."
35,00:02:02.12,00:02:02.12,">> Is she here? >> No, but she's coming."
36,00:02:03.83,00:02:03.83,">> Right now? >> Uh, Tribal didn't pan out the"
37,00:02:08.25,00:02:08.25,"way I expected. Jacquie got the boot, and now"
38,00:02:11.96,00:02:11.96,I'm sort of sitting a little high and dry.
39,00:02:19.54,00:02:19.54,>> No. >> I think they were scared
40,00:02:21.83,00:02:21.83,about me having any strength in my alliance with Jacquie.
41,00:02:25.38,00:02:25.38,Maybe now I will be able to pull off some sort of coup de
42,00:02:28.29,00:02:28.29,"grace once again with, uh, Sugar."
43,00:02:32.00,00:02:32.00,She's back from Exile Island. One of Sugar's biggest pluses
44,00:02:36.38,00:02:36.38,is the fact that she has the immunity idol tucked up her
45,00:02:39.08,00:02:39.08,"sleeve, and I've got Sugar in my pocket."
46,00:02:43.00,00:02:43.00,>> Hey. >> Hi.
47,00:02:45.17,00:02:45.17,Hello. >> Welcome back.
48,00:02:47.46,00:02:47.46,>> Yeah. So that means Jacquie's gone.
49,00:02:51.08,00:02:51.08,>> Yep. >> That sucks.
50,00:02:54.21,00:02:54.21,My very first thought when I saw that it was the new Fang
51,00:02:56.96,00:02:56.96,"tribe was, ""Yay, I get to see Jacquie and Ace."""
52,00:03:00.21,00:03:00.21,"But instead, I saw Kelly, and that was a big surprise."
53,00:03:05.08,00:03:05.08,"I hate Tribal Council. Luckily, it was dark, so maybe"
54,00:03:11.25,00:03:11.25,I could have hidden some of my disappointment.
55,00:03:14.29,00:03:14.29,">> Is Exile Island, uh, cool? >> It was this time."
56,00:03:17.83,00:03:17.83,>> It's a cool place? It was inside the Sugar Shack.
57,00:03:20.21,00:03:20.21,">> It's a cool place? >> Yeah, it's not bad."
58,00:03:23.04,00:03:23.04,">> So the clue was pretty hard to find, huh, for the idol?"
59,00:03:25.88,00:03:25.88,">> Uh, I-I don't know. I gave up after three clues the"
60,00:03:28.50,00:03:28.50,"first time, so... >> It's called the Sugar Shack"
61,00:03:34.75,00:03:34.75,now. (chuckles)
62,00:03:37.08,00:03:37.08,">> Sugar, Sugar, Sugar. She's been out to Exile Island"
63,00:03:41.25,00:03:41.25,the longest. She's had plenty of time to
64,00:03:43.42,00:03:43.42,look for the idol. And I feel in my heart she has
65,00:03:46.92,00:03:46.92,the idol. So I got to get rid of her.

77,00:05:33.62,00:05:33.62,That guy right there. >> It'll shock you if you
78,00:05:36.04,00:05:36.04,touch him. >> Grab a hold of him.
79,00:05:38.21,00:05:38.21,">> Oh, damn, you're right! In addition to the gill net,"
80,00:05:41.54,00:05:41.54,"Bob checked the traps, and he had a shocking surprise, which"
81,00:05:45.62,00:05:45.62,was literal. It was this little fish.
82,00:05:47.00,00:05:47.00,He's about four inches long. And every time you pick him
83,00:05:50.04,00:05:50.04,"up, he sends a little electric charge through your hand."
84,00:05:52.92,00:05:52.92,">> Ooh, he can-- I felt it through my fingers."
85,00:05:54.58,00:05:54.58,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, that's it."
86,00:05:56.25,00:05:56.25,>> That was weird. >> Randy.
87,00:05:58.71,00:05:58.71,">> Dude, we got five. >> We have five, like..."
88,00:06:01.29,00:06:01.29,>> Look how big they are. >> Huge fish.
89,00:06:02.75,00:06:02.75,>> Good-sized tilapia. >> It's unbelievable.
90,00:06:05.33,00:06:05.33,"Man, that's a nice drag. >> Yeah, that was a big one."
91,00:06:08.25,00:06:08.25,">> Dan, myself, and Susie, uh, got picked to be in this new"
92,00:06:11.96,00:06:11.96,Kota tribe. It's-it's wonderful.
93,00:06:13.58,00:06:13.58,I can't believe it. Gill net worked-- unreal.
94,00:06:17.08,00:06:17.08,"Fish, beans, corn. Way, way better than Fang."
95,00:06:22.17,00:06:22.17,So I have no complaints. Beautiful.

107,00:07:38.08,00:07:38.08,Right at the bottom. There he is.

110,00:07:53.29,00:07:53.29,>> Look how big his tusks are. >> I know.
111,00:07:56.17,00:07:56.17,"That's crazy. They could be, like, right in"

113,00:08:02.54,00:08:02.54,>> Looks crazy. (elephant trumpeting)
114,00:08:05.79,00:08:05.79,"Oh, here, he's gonna rip something."
115,00:08:09.12,00:08:09.12,>> Ooh. >> Yo.
116,00:08:10.62,00:08:10.62,>> That's crazy. Look at him.
117,00:08:13.17,00:08:13.17,He's beautiful. >> Oh!

123,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,stuff so he can throw it. Look at him. Look at him.
124,00:08:41.62,00:08:41.62,Look at him! >> Ah!
125,00:08:43.08,00:08:43.08,">> Come on, shh. >> No."

131,00:09:05.38,00:09:05.38,But you can't necessarily see him all the time.
132,00:09:08.42,00:09:08.42,"And to actually see one and put the face to the noise, it's"
133,00:09:11.58,00:09:11.58,"magnificent. >> Oh, my God."

148,00:10:56.04,00:10:56.04,>> PROBST: A lot of reactions on Kota.
149,00:10:57.96,00:10:57.96,Surprised? >> Yeah.

174,00:12:05.21,00:12:05.21,>> PROBST: Worth playing for? >> Yes!

193,00:13:09.12,00:13:09.12,gonna score. Matty has another for Fang.
194,00:13:12.21,00:13:12.21,"Another fake on Charlie, and he gets it through again, and"
195,00:13:15.21,00:13:15.21,Kenny catches it again! Fang with an early lead.
196,00:13:19.00,00:13:19.00,">> Crystal, do not let anything through."
197,00:13:21.17,00:13:21.17,>> PROBST: Dan has two pieces of fruit.
198,00:13:23.62,00:13:23.62,Ace doing a great job with that club.
199,00:13:26.42,00:13:26.42,>> This is so fun. >> PROBST: Different story for
200,00:13:28.46,00:13:28.46,Fang. Matty is working Charlie.
201,00:13:31.29,00:13:31.29,Another big Matty-to-Kenny connection.
202,00:13:34.04,00:13:34.04,That combination is giving Fang a big lead right now.
203,00:13:36.88,00:13:36.88,">> Dan, throw two pieces at once."
204,00:13:38.96,00:13:38.96,>> PROBST: Dan has two pieces of fruit.
205,00:13:42.17,00:13:42.17,That one connects. A little banana doesn't weigh
206,00:13:45.83,00:13:45.83,much. Dan connects with Randy.
207,00:13:51.00,00:13:51.00,">> Atta boy, Dan, perfect. >> PROBST: Kota starting to get"
208,00:13:53.50,00:13:53.50,the hang of it now. >> Yes!
209,00:13:57.33,00:13:57.33,>> PROBST: Fang continues to make connections with those
210,00:14:00.25,00:14:00.25,smaller pieces of fruit. Dan has half a watermelon and a
211,00:14:05.08,00:14:05.08,pineapple. Catches the half a watermelon.
212,00:14:08.58,00:14:08.58,That's a lot of weight. Matty to Kenny continues to
213,00:14:11.29,00:14:11.29,work. Two minutes left.
214,00:14:16.21,00:14:16.21,Big reception by Randy! Kota making a good comeback.
215,00:14:21.50,00:14:21.50,>> Got it! >> PROBST: Huge pineapple caught
216,00:14:23.83,00:14:23.83,by Kenny. >> Wait for Dan! Wait for Dan!
217,00:14:26.00,00:14:26.00,>> PROBST: Waiting on that left hand. There it is.
218,00:14:28.08,00:14:28.08,Both baskets look pretty full. 45 seconds left.
219,00:14:31.46,00:14:31.46,We are neck-and-neck. Dan has a watermelon and a
220,00:14:35.46,00:14:35.46,pineapple. Annihilates Ace.
221,00:14:38.83,00:14:38.83,"The good news is, Ace, nothing got through."
222,00:14:40.92,00:14:40.92,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: We're in the final
223,00:14:44.42,00:14:44.42,seconds of this challenge. It is very close.
224,00:14:46.75,00:14:46.75,You need to make those last pieces of fruit count.
225,00:14:51.42,00:14:51.42,"Ten seconds left! Five, four, three,"
226,00:14:58.71,00:14:58.71,"two, one. That's it!"
227,00:15:02.62,00:15:02.62,"Challenge is over! >> Good job, guys."
228,00:15:05.21,00:15:05.21,>> Like that where you guys had going two at a time.
229,00:15:07.62,00:15:07.62,That was awesome. >> PROBST: Good effort.
230,00:15:09.58,00:15:09.58,Very close. We'll start with Fang.
231,00:15:12.08,00:15:12.08,We're gonna weigh to see who has the most weight.
232,00:15:24.29,00:15:24.29,16 pounds for Fang. >> Not bad.
233,00:15:28.12,00:15:28.12,">> PROBST: Kota, you gotta have 16 pounds and an ounce."
234,00:15:38.25,00:15:38.25,You're at ten. Kota just under 15 pounds.
235,00:15:47.71,00:15:47.71,>> Come on! Come on. >> Yeah!
236,00:15:51.83,00:15:51.83,>> PROBST: This is what you have left.
237,00:15:56.62,00:15:56.62,"By two pounds, Kota wins reward. (all cheering)"
238,00:16:08.83,00:16:08.83,"All right, Kota, now you have another big decision to make."
239,00:16:12.08,00:16:12.08,Which member of Fang are you sending to Exile Island?
240,00:16:15.17,00:16:15.17,>> She might as well have the mail forwarded there 'cause
241,00:16:17.46,00:16:17.46,Sugar's going again. (Sugar laughs)
242,00:16:20.25,00:16:20.25,>> That's all right. I've already named it the
243,00:16:22.50,00:16:22.50,"""Sugar Shack."" >> PROBST: Dan, why sending"
244,00:16:26.42,00:16:26.42,Sugar again? >> Just strategy. Purely comedy.
245,00:16:28.92,00:16:28.92,>> Wow. (Sugar laughing)
246,00:16:31.04,00:16:31.04,">> No, no, because we think if she finds the idol, she'd had to"
247,00:16:33.75,00:16:33.75,"play it before the merge, and we'd like it to get back into"
248,00:16:36.50,00:16:36.50,circulation. >> Whatever.
249,00:16:38.04,00:16:38.04,>> PROBST: I know you don't need the map.
250,00:16:40.04,00:16:40.04,You could probably show me where it is better.
251,00:16:42.04,00:16:42.04,>> Bye. >> PROBST: Sugar will return in
252,00:16:44.08,00:16:44.08,time for the next immunity challenge.
253,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,"Fang, got nothing for you. Grab your stuff."
254,00:16:49.58,00:16:49.58,"Head back to camp. Kota, congratulations."
255,00:16:52.12,00:16:52.12,Come get your reward. >> Thank you.
256,00:16:54.12,00:16:54.12,">> Yes, thank you. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
257,00:17:10.12,00:17:10.12,">> Wow, guys, the plants are okay."
258,00:17:12.71,00:17:12.71,They're getting water for that. >> We just got back from our
259,00:17:15.12,00:17:15.12,"reward challenge with all of our new fruits and vegetables,"
260,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,"and so spirits are high around here, but I feel bad for those"
261,00:17:21.25,00:17:21.25,Fang members because I know all they're eating is rice with no
262,00:17:23.75,00:17:23.75,"flavor, and we have tons and tons of food here."
263,00:17:26.08,00:17:26.08,>> Life is good. >> The rich are definitely
264,00:17:29.21,00:17:29.21,"getting richer here at Kota. >> All right, so, instead of"
265,00:17:34.21,00:17:34.21,"the Axis of Evil, we now have the Evil Empire, guys."
266,00:17:37.71,00:17:37.71,And I think we need to keep our numbers and stick together once
267,00:17:41.04,00:17:41.04,the merge comes. I'm gonna need all seven of
268,00:17:43.58,00:17:43.58,you guys. We're gonna have-- our first
269,00:17:45.29,00:17:45.29,couple of votes after the merge are gonna have to be unanimous.
270,00:17:48.21,00:17:48.21,"I'm an outspoken person and, and I tend to want to, um, get"
271,00:17:53.58,00:17:53.58,people's adrenaline going. It's a game where you light
272,00:17:57.25,00:17:57.25,"a fire under people going up against, you know, someone you"
273,00:17:59.62,00:17:59.62,"can coin the ""Evil Empire"" absolutely gives us more"
274,00:18:02.38,00:18:02.38,"motivation to go in there and win, and not just win by a"
275,00:18:05.08,00:18:05.08,"little, win by a lot. And once we get one or two out,"
276,00:18:08.25,00:18:08.25,"they're gonna crumble, and our seven will go further."
277,00:18:11.17,00:18:11.17,>> The next immunity challenge is the most important of the
278,00:18:13.33,00:18:13.33,game. I think everyone's on the same
279,00:18:16.04,00:18:16.04,page about that. I think the biggest issue with
280,00:18:18.29,00:18:18.29,"Dan is he is so eager to express his undying, complete,"
281,00:18:26.42,00:18:26.42,and total devotion to the new Kota tribe that no one believes
282,00:18:31.58,00:18:31.58,"him. >> Us seven, as long as we win"
283,00:18:35.42,00:18:35.42,"the immunity challenges, and us seven stick together, we're"
284,00:18:38.42,00:18:38.42,always gonna have the numbers on them.
285,00:18:40.12,00:18:40.12,">> On the flip side, Susie's the opposite of Dan."
286,00:18:42.08,00:18:42.08,She's so quiet that it makes you think that she's not quite
287,00:18:45.75,00:18:45.75,as on board about stuff that we've been talking about.
288,00:18:49.92,00:18:49.92,"We're now focused on the next 48 hours, which..."
289,00:18:53.12,00:18:53.12,>> Crucial. >> ...is the most important part
290,00:18:55.12,00:18:55.12,of this game right now. I don't have the confidence
291,00:18:57.42,00:18:57.42,that we get to the merge and these people have got my back.
292,00:19:02.25,00:19:02.25,">> Come and get your chunk. Wait, wait, where's Randy?"
293,00:19:10.12,00:19:10.12,">> Randy, get up here! >> All right."
294,00:19:14.42,00:19:14.42,">> The challenge today was fun. Once again, Kota won, and did I"
295,00:19:19.62,00:19:19.62,kick ass or what? My plan right now is just
296,00:19:24.79,00:19:24.79,"continue to win challenges and not rock the boat, and I will"
297,00:19:28.04,00:19:28.04,be Kota yellow to the end. >> When Kota sent me to
298,00:19:43.12,00:19:43.12,"Exile, they said it was for pure comedy sake, which is"
299,00:19:47.42,00:19:47.42,hilarious 'cause I was thinking the joke's on you.
300,00:19:53.50,00:19:53.50,Better than last time. Everybody else in the game is
301,00:19:57.00,00:19:57.00,"tired and starving and stinky and dirty as all get-out, and I"
302,00:20:02.50,00:20:02.50,am living high on the hog in Eden all by myself with my own
303,00:20:07.21,00:20:07.21,"lake and fruit and comfort, and I'm a very happy camper now."
304,00:20:12.46,00:20:12.46,"I have the idol, and I'd have to be really dumb to get sent"
305,00:20:17.92,00:20:17.92,home next. But I definitely am happy and
306,00:20:20.25,00:20:20.25,fat. (laughs) (sighs)
307,00:20:33.62,00:20:33.62,">> Is that all the rice, that little bag right there?"
308,00:20:36.21,00:20:36.21,>> Yeah. There's about 13 grains of rice.
309,00:20:40.21,00:20:40.21,We can all have two grains. >> Eat your rice.
310,00:20:43.54,00:20:43.54,>> Don't tell me to do nothing. >> Eat your rice.
311,00:20:55.00,00:20:55.00,">> Okay, Crystal. Don't tell me what I should be"
312,00:20:59.62,00:20:59.62,doing out here. >> Eat your rice.
313,00:21:01.25,00:21:01.25,>> Shut your mouth! I'll tell you that much.
314,00:21:09.08,00:21:09.08,"I've been out here just a couple of weeks, and it's way"
315,00:21:11.58,00:21:11.58,more difficult than I ever would have expected.
316,00:21:14.79,00:21:14.79,Not only do you gotta win these challenges to-to live well out
317,00:21:18.42,00:21:18.42,"here, you know, you gotta deal with these people day in"
318,00:21:21.46,00:21:21.46,"and day out, 24/7. >> She is so annoying."
319,00:21:24.67,00:21:24.67,">> It definitely plays tricks with your head, you know what I"
320,00:21:27.08,00:21:27.08,mean? And it's overwhelming at
321,00:21:28.38,00:21:28.38,"times. It's hard, and I do question,"
322,00:21:31.17,00:21:31.17,"you know, what am I doing? >> Is GC sad or something?"
323,00:21:34.29,00:21:34.29,>> I don't know. I think so. >> Like he misses home or...?
324,00:21:39.79,00:21:39.79,>> I don't know. >> They're cracking at the
325,00:21:41.58,00:21:41.58,edges. The seams are going.
326,00:21:43.71,00:21:43.71,This argument comes out of nowhere.
327,00:21:46.08,00:21:46.08,"I mean, it was brilliant. I couldn't have planned it"
328,00:21:48.75,00:21:48.75,"better. I'm, like, ""These people are"
329,00:21:50.96,00:21:50.96,"just gonna implode."" I was just sitting back and"
330,00:21:54.12,00:21:54.12,"enjoying it, you know? I was, like, ""Oh, good, finally,"
331,00:21:57.25,00:21:57.25,"something's gonna happen."" >> You know, I've kind of had"
332,00:22:04.25,00:22:04.25,enough with these people here. I need to just get back to real
333,00:22:07.29,00:22:07.29,life because this game is-- I feel like it's-- it's changing
334,00:22:10.58,00:22:10.58,"me, and it's not for the better. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
335,00:22:26.83,00:22:26.83,>> We got some mail. >> Doesn't look so fun.
336,00:22:30.71,00:22:30.71,">> ""The gravity of the situation is you really need to score."
337,00:22:36.04,00:22:36.04,"At least prevent the other tribe, or tonight you will lose"
338,00:22:40.21,00:22:40.21,"one more."" >> I think we're inside of this."
339,00:22:44.25,00:22:44.25,"And it rolls down the hill. >> Okay, well, whatever it is."
340,00:22:48.08,00:22:48.08,">> Today in the challenge, I think our chances are slim."
341,00:22:51.54,00:22:51.54,This tribe's floating. This tribe is all over the
342,00:22:53.58,00:22:53.58,place. People are starting to become
343,00:22:56.75,00:22:56.75,"affected big-time by the, uh, the elements out here."
344,00:22:59.88,00:22:59.88,GC's losing it. Crystal's bugging out.
345,00:23:01.75,00:23:01.75,It's all over the place. It's a bunch of insanity.
346,00:23:05.04,00:23:05.04,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> GC!
347,00:23:29.46,00:23:29.46,(whistling loudly) >> We were about to go to the
348,00:23:34.83,00:23:34.83,"challenge, and we couldn't find GC."
349,00:23:36.62,00:23:36.62,"Like, everybody was looking for him because we need our team"
350,00:23:39.00,00:23:39.00,"there, and he was off on his own, you know?"
351,00:23:43.17,00:23:43.17,>> Are you serious? We have to leave without him?
352,00:23:44.79,00:23:44.79,>> Yeah. >> GC!
353,00:23:49.00,00:23:49.00,">> What if he got eaten by, like, a monkey, dude?"
354,00:23:52.38,00:23:52.38,">> Hopefully, he comes back in time."
355,00:23:54.38,00:23:54.38,But he doesn't like being told what to do.
356,00:23:56.46,00:23:56.46,"You know, that's just how he... how he rolls."
357,00:23:58.46,00:23:58.46,>> I think we're gonna have to leave without him.
358,00:24:00.42,00:24:00.42,">> Dude, this is gonna suck. Want to all scream at the"
359,00:24:03.00,00:24:03.00,"same time? >> Okay, ready?"
360,00:24:04.71,00:24:04.71,"One, two, three. >> GC!"
361,00:24:09.12,00:24:09.12,">> I'm, like, damn, they're using energy to yell right now."
362,00:24:12.25,00:24:12.25,>> I agree. I-I'm not giving you any form
363,00:24:14.75,00:24:14.75,of argument. >> I'm personally getting fed up
364,00:24:18.46,00:24:18.46,"with GC. He just throws these tantrums,"
365,00:24:20.92,00:24:20.92,"and it is just upsetting to me, and I'm... I'm just getting fed"
366,00:24:24.21,00:24:24.21,up with the tantrums from a grown adult.
367,00:24:27.58,00:24:27.58,>> GC! >> I'm not going to the dock
368,00:24:32.17,00:24:32.17,yelling after a grown man. >> GC?
369,00:24:38.96,00:24:38.96,Did he not hear me? >> Why? We need you.
370,00:24:51.04,00:24:51.04,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
371,00:25:06.29,00:25:06.29,"We'll now bring in Sugar, returning from Exile Island."
372,00:25:15.21,00:25:15.21,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
373,00:25:17.50,00:25:17.50,>> Yes. Yep. >> PROBST: First things first.
374,00:25:19.12,00:25:19.12,"Dan, I will take back immunity. Once again, immunity is back up"
375,00:25:24.92,00:25:24.92,"for grabs. For today's challenge, one"
376,00:25:28.54,00:25:28.54,member from each tribe will throw a ball down a cliff

523,00:35:48.75,00:35:48.75,">> Uh, a little bit. I can see it when, you know,"
524,00:35:51.04,00:35:51.04,"people are running out of belt loops and, you know, things"

532,00:36:14.38,00:36:14.38,what's more important to you. Is it staying out here and
533,00:36:18.08,00:36:18.08,starving and dealing with personalities and losing
534,00:36:21.04,00:36:21.04,"challenges, and it's definitely hard when you just"

564,00:37:54.17,00:37:54.17,You've spent more time on Exile than you have at the Kota or
565,00:37:56.83,00:37:56.83,the Fang camp. How concerned are you that I'm
566,00:37:59.50,00:37:59.50,clearly somebody that might be going home because I don't even
567,00:38:03.04,00:38:03.04,know anybody? >> Right.
568,00:38:05.08,00:38:05.08,I kind of feel like it could be me.
569,00:38:07.50,00:38:07.50,I am the one that knows the least about these people and
570,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,"they know the least about me. So, it could just as easily be"
571,00:38:13.25,00:38:13.25,"me tonight, so, I brought my bag. "
572,00:38:15.42,00:38:15.42,">> PROBST: Kenny, is it a little frustrating that Sugar keeps"
573,00:38:17.54,00:38:17.54,getting sent to Exile? There's something extremely
574,00:38:20.00,00:38:20.00,"valuable out there. >> Um, yeah, I'm sure it comes"
575,00:38:23.79,00:38:23.79,"to everybody's mind that, you know, maybe she found it, but"
576,00:38:27.04,00:38:27.04,nobody knows unless she's told people. 
577,00:38:29.29,00:38:29.29,"But it is very frustrating. >> PROBST: So, what kind of"
578,00:38:32.71,00:38:32.71,"strategy, Sugar, goes through your mind, whether you have the"
579,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,idol or not? Do I let them know I have the
580,00:38:36.79,00:38:36.79,idol? Do I convince them I don't
581,00:38:38.33,00:38:38.33,have the idol? >> Nobody really asked me if I
582,00:38:40.67,00:38:40.67,"had the idol, actually. >> PROBST: Does that strike you"
583,00:38:43.38,00:38:43.38,"as odd? >> No, not considering"
584,00:38:45.83,00:38:45.83,that you're allowed to go through people's bags.
585,00:38:48.21,00:38:48.21,"So, no, it doesn't surprise me. >> PROBST: So, you think your"
586,00:38:50.75,00:38:50.75,bag has been gone through or you don't know?
587,00:38:53.04,00:38:53.04,>> I don't know. >> PROBST: Do you keep your bag
588,00:38:55.42,00:38:55.42,with you? >> Nope.
589,00:38:57.46,00:38:57.46,I keep it out where anybody can go through it if they want.
590,00:39:00.38,00:39:00.38,">> PROBST: Crystal, crazy to leave your bag out or crazy"
591,00:39:03.04,00:39:03.04,smart? >> Crazy to leave your bag out.
592,00:39:07.62,00:39:07.62,">> PROBST: Sugar, do you really truly not care if people know"
593,00:39:11.04,00:39:11.04,you have the idol? >> Maybe there's a sense of
594,00:39:14.25,00:39:14.25,"power in knowing that, you know, somebody has the idol"
595,00:39:17.33,00:39:17.33,and maybe you don't want to vote against them because they
596,00:39:20.96,00:39:20.96,"might use it to vote you out. >> PROBST: All right, it is time"
597,00:39:26.21,00:39:26.21,"to vote. Sugar, you're up."
598,00:39:38.12,00:39:38.12,>> I'm only voting for you because you want to go home
599,00:39:41.04,00:39:41.04,and I'm really sorry because I think you're a really cool
600,00:39:43.04,00:39:43.04,person. >> My vote is for Kelly
601,00:39:54.67,00:39:54.67,because I had to vote for somebody.
602,00:40:18.04,00:40:18.04,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
603,00:40:33.67,00:40:33.67,If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to
604,00:40:35.67,00:40:35.67,"play it, now would be the time to do so."
605,00:40:45.25,00:40:45.25,"Okay, once the votes are read, the decision is final."
606,00:40:47.29,00:40:47.29,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
607,00:40:48.96,00:40:48.96,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
608,00:40:54.75,00:40:54.75,First vote: GC. GC.
609,00:41:01.46,00:41:01.46,Two votes GC. Kelly.
610,00:41:06.42,00:41:06.42,Two votes GC; one vote Kelly. GC.
611,00:41:12.08,00:41:12.08,Three votes GC. Fifth person voted out of
612,00:41:16.62,00:41:16.62,Survivor: Gabon: GC. That's four; that's enough.
613,00:41:19.62,00:41:19.62,"You need to bring me your torch. GC, your tribe has spoken."
614,00:41:43.79,00:41:43.79,You guys have endured a lot in your first 15 days.
615,00:41:47.17,00:41:47.17,One thing is for certain: you are going to have to dig deep
616,00:41:51.12,00:41:51.12,if you're going to last in this game.
617,00:41:54.00,00:41:54.00,Grab your torches and head back to camp.

623,00:42:15.17,00:42:15.17,Survivor: >> I just don't know who would
624,00:42:17.25,00:42:17.25,"be my potential Benedict Arnold. Until merge, on your girl,"
625,00:42:20.67,00:42:20.67,you're not gonna stab me in the back.
626,00:42:22.50,00:42:22.50,>> I made a pact with Ace. >> Deal.
627,00:42:24.46,00:42:24.46,>> Deal. >> This is going to be the 
628,00:42:29.21,00:42:29.21,start of a great run for me. I have complete supremacy.
629,00:42:39.04,00:42:39.04,">> For all the people who, who might say that I quit or I"
630,00:42:41.38,00:42:41.38,"just gave up, call it what you want."
631,00:42:43.17,00:42:43.17,"The back-stabbing and the lying, that's the part that I"
632,00:42:45.21,00:42:45.21,really didn't agree with. I never expected it to be this
633,00:42:47.08,00:42:47.08,hard. The vote for Kelly was the
634,00:42:48.67,00:42:48.67,throwaway vote. She was the one who I connected
635,00:42:50.92,00:42:50.92,with the least. I got the utmost respect for
636,00:42:53.33,00:42:53.33,"anybody who makes it, who even tries out, and whoever has"
637,00:42:56.88,00:42:56.88,walked in my shoes.
