1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.77,00:00:02.77," Survivor, 16 strangers were abandoned on a remote island in"
3,00:00:06.40,00:00:06.40,the South Pacific. Both tribes were stunned to
4,00:00:08.97,00:00:08.97,learn they had been given no food and no water.
5,00:00:11.47,00:00:11.47,">> We knew that if we didn't work as a team, one of us was"
6,00:00:13.73,00:00:13.73,going to starve to death. >> JEFF: Hunter emerged as the
7,00:00:16.40,00:00:16.40,disputed leader of the Maraamu tribe.
8,00:00:18.30,00:00:18.30,">> I'm an alpha male, too. He's not my daddy."
9,00:00:20.73,00:00:20.73,>> JEFF: And Kathy's attempts to lead the Rotu tribe were also
10,00:00:23.80,00:00:23.80,met with resistance. >> How many hours I spent
11,00:00:25.90,00:00:25.90,"yesterday, I'm wiped. >> I am not trying to be pushy."
12,00:00:28.03,00:00:28.03,">> JEFF: Maraamu got fire the first night, and things heated"
13,00:00:31.03,00:00:31.03,up between Rob and Sarah. >> Are they flirting or are they
14,00:00:33.77,00:00:33.77,making an alliance? >> JEFF: A fatal mistake cost
15,00:00:36.37,00:00:36.37,Maraamu their first challenge. And Rotu claimed victory and
16,00:00:40.23,00:00:40.23,"immunity. Maraamu went to Tribal Council,"
17,00:00:42.70,00:00:42.70,where Peter was the first person voted out of the tribe.
18,00:00:45.87,00:00:45.87,"Peter, the tribe has spoken. 15 are left."
19,00:00:50.27,00:00:50.27,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Why don't we sit in one big
20,00:02:04.10,00:02:04.10,line and massage each other. >> A massage circle.
21,00:02:06.27,00:02:06.27,>> This is how Rotu stays together.
22,00:02:09.47,00:02:09.47,>> That's right. >> That's exactly right.
23,00:02:11.50,00:02:11.50,">> You guys, we're going to do this every night, I swear..."
24,00:02:14.07,00:02:14.07,">> I agree. >> Oh, look at those stars, you"
25,00:02:17.40,00:02:17.40,"guys, it's just awesome. >> I love being in this tribe."
26,00:02:22.13,00:02:22.13,I love everyone's spirit out here and how they decide to
27,00:02:25.73,00:02:25.73,"interact with each other, in positive ways."
28,00:02:28.10,00:02:28.10,">> Good night. >> I'll tell you what, any of"
29,00:02:30.37,00:02:30.37,"this group could win, it'd tickle the hell out of me."
30,00:02:33.37,00:02:33.37,>> This is most definitely the love shack for our little love
31,00:02:37.93,00:02:37.93,tribe. But Kathy isn't trying to be one
32,00:02:42.57,00:02:42.57,"of us, to get along with us. She sleeps alone out by the"
33,00:02:47.77,00:02:47.77,fire. (rooster crowing)
34,00:03:03.50,00:03:03.50,">> Being out here is really about being part of a group,"
35,00:03:06.03,00:03:06.03,"especially in the beginning. I mean, first impressions are"
36,00:03:08.93,00:03:08.93,"the most important. And Kathy chooses to sleep, you"
37,00:03:12.53,00:03:12.53,"know, by herself. >> I mean there's just an"
38,00:03:15.07,00:03:15.07,unwritten rule. >> I think she's out by herself
39,00:03:17.63,00:03:17.63,"fishing right now. >> It's only the fourth day, and"
40,00:03:21.47,00:03:21.47,"we don't have any food. I mean, the ocean has food in"
41,00:03:24.90,00:03:24.90,"it, so I knew it was out here somewhere, but I never turned"
42,00:03:28.40,00:03:28.40,over rocks in my lifetime to find food.
43,00:03:31.07,00:03:31.07,"But this will give me some credibility today, because then"
44,00:03:34.77,00:03:34.77,maybe then they'll listen to me when I tell them it's going to
45,00:03:37.53,00:03:37.53,"rain, and we are going to be miserable in that terrible hut."
46,00:03:46.70,00:03:46.70,">> Rob has been struggling the last couple days, he's been"
47,00:03:50.23,00:03:50.23,"pretty sick, not being able to help us out very much."
48,00:03:53.00,00:03:53.00,>> Being a big guy comes with needing a lot of food.
49,00:03:56.63,00:03:56.63,">> How you doing, man, better? >> I think it's taken the"
50,00:04:00.43,00:04:00.43,biggest toll on him not having what he's used to.
51,00:04:04.63,00:04:04.63,">> I tried to make them all the same size, you know?"
52,00:04:07.60,00:04:07.60,">> Since we've been out here, I don't think any of us have had"
53,00:04:10.60,00:04:10.60,any protein. We're going to change that
54,00:04:12.37,00:04:12.37,today. We're going to do something.
55,00:04:13.87,00:04:13.87,">> I think I would like to get either a pig or a chicken,"
56,00:04:16.10,00:04:16.10,because I really need to sink my teeth into some sort of meat.
57,00:04:19.17,00:04:19.17,">> We know that there's food out there, and we have to use what"
58,00:04:25.47,00:04:25.47,nature has given us to create different weapons.
59,00:04:28.87,00:04:28.87,>> Needs some work. >> Fish hooks from an Acacia
60,00:04:32.70,00:04:32.70,"tree, fishing spears. >> I got this tubing, kept it on"
61,00:04:36.27,00:04:36.27,the back of my sunglasses to keep them from falling off my
62,00:04:40.17,00:04:40.17,head. Too low.
63,00:04:41.80,00:04:41.80,">> Oh, my gosh. >> Okay, hold on."
64,00:04:44.30,00:04:44.30,One of the more creative things that I came up with was my own
65,00:04:47.23,00:04:47.23,"shrimp catcher. Oh, shut up."
66,00:04:49.00,00:04:49.00,">> Oh, you are kidding me. >> But our biggest one is we"
67,00:04:52.10,00:04:52.10,have a pig snare. So we pull this down.
68,00:04:56.10,00:04:56.10,">> Oh, that will work perfect! >> If I catch a pig, you know, I"
69,00:05:01.57,00:05:01.57,might as well set my table at the final four.
70,00:05:05.10,00:05:05.10,>> Yay! >> We're going to get a pig!
71,00:05:17.00,00:05:17.00,>> Let's get a weather report. Somebody turn on the weather
72,00:05:20.53,00:05:20.53,"station. You got today's weather report,"
73,00:05:23.67,00:05:23.67,"Hunter? >> Hold on, let me turn to the"
74,00:05:25.80,00:05:25.80,"station. >> Mother Earth, Hunter Ellis"
75,00:05:28.67,00:05:28.67,with today's morning weather! >> Today's Marquesas weather
76,00:05:32.47,00:05:32.47,report coming to you live from Happiness Cove in the Marquesan
77,00:05:36.03,00:05:36.03,"Islands. Right now, it's partly sunny,"
78,00:05:38.83,00:05:38.83,"temperatures in the mid 80s, but it will reach a blistering 160"
79,00:05:42.27,00:05:42.27,degrees according to Rob today. (laughter)
80,00:05:47.27,00:05:47.27,>> We start off every day with a morning show.
81,00:05:49.33,00:05:49.33,"Sean runs the show, I'm in charge of the food"
82,00:05:52.13,00:05:52.13,portion. >> Let's hear today's food
83,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,"review, Rob. >> Today, we're going to be"
84,00:05:56.20,00:05:56.20,"starting off with blueberry pancakes, bacon and sausage."
85,00:05:58.97,00:05:58.97,>> It's time for some music. We're going to put on an oldie
86,00:06:02.43,00:06:02.43,but a goody. >> Hello.
87,00:06:04.80,00:06:04.80,">> \xe2\x99\xaa I knew you want to leave me, but I refuse to let you go"
88,00:06:11.37,00:06:11.37,"\xe2\x99\xaa If I have to plead, Baby, baby,"
89,00:06:15.77,00:06:15.77,You don't leave me... \xe2\x99\xaa >> Wow!
90,00:06:22.00,00:06:22.00,"\xe2\x99\xaa Baby, baby. \xe2\x99\xaa (humming and scatting melody)"
91,00:06:27.43,00:06:27.43,Woo! Yeah! >> The morning show is basically
92,00:06:32.50,00:06:32.50,our break from the day. And it's our little bit of comic
93,00:06:35.40,00:06:35.40,relief for everybody before we get into the toiling world of
94,00:06:38.83,00:06:38.83,surviving here in the Marquesas. >> Nice catch!
95,00:06:48.60,00:06:48.60,">> Oh, yeah. >> You know, I think most normal"
96,00:06:52.50,00:06:52.50,"people that go camping, you know, take along their little"
97,00:06:55.33,00:06:55.33,"gas stoves and their heaters and their tents and they think,"
98,00:06:58.30,00:06:58.30,"""Yeah, I can do it, I can camp."" We have nothing."
99,00:07:01.00,00:07:01.00,"If we have little ones to build it up, it makes it more sturdy."
100,00:07:05.27,00:07:05.27,">> There are a number of contributors in the camp, Mama,"
101,00:07:07.90,00:07:07.90,who you would think would be the least likely maybe is one of the
102,00:07:11.27,00:07:11.27,"strongest. >> What's that like a box, mom?"
103,00:07:14.27,00:07:14.27,">> Well, I'm trying to build us a chicken trap."
104,00:07:17.00,00:07:17.00,"I've never done this before, but I got a concept up here."
105,00:07:20.57,00:07:20.57,I'm trying to put to use. >> Miss Trisha has definitely
106,00:07:23.80,00:07:23.80,changed since the last Tribal Council.
107,00:07:25.90,00:07:25.90,"When we got back, it was a totally different thing the next"
108,00:07:28.30,00:07:28.30,"morning. She was up, she was collecting"
109,00:07:30.33,00:07:30.33,"firewood, she won't sit down, she won't rest."
110,00:07:32.83,00:07:32.83,">> What did I say? I'll help you, let me move the"
111,00:07:36.30,00:07:36.30,water. >> I think that she's being
112,00:07:38.03,00:07:38.03,"herself now, at first she was just a little scared she was"
113,00:07:40.83,00:07:40.83,going to get voted off and now she's in it and she's
114,00:07:43.50,00:07:43.50,"comfortable. >> Put it on my back, please,"
115,00:07:45.23,00:07:45.23,since you got it on your hands. >> Notice she didn't ask us?
116,00:07:47.87,00:07:47.87,>> He has it on his hands. Yeah.
117,00:07:49.50,00:07:49.50,Be sure to go up underneath the bathing suit.
118,00:07:53.20,00:07:53.20,">> Pervert! >> Rub it on there, go ahead."
119,00:07:57.53,00:07:57.53,">> I need it, y'all, I burn. >> That's nasty."
120,00:08:02.70,00:08:02.70,"Go underneath, underneath. >> I knew it was going to work!"
121,00:08:20.43,00:08:20.43,"I knew it! >> What you got, guys?"
122,00:08:22.30,00:08:22.30,>> Anything? >> Got a shrimp.
123,00:08:24.37,00:08:24.37,">> No, really? >> Yes I did."
124,00:08:26.33,00:08:26.33,>> Look it all that meat. >> Look at that.
125,00:08:31.87,00:08:31.87,">> Within the tribe, you're trying to develop a hierarchy."
126,00:08:34.57,00:08:34.57,I want to be as high as possible.
127,00:08:36.33,00:08:36.33,"The highest place, really, I think that you can be is to"
128,00:08:38.10,00:08:38.10,"provide food for the tribe, specifically protein."
129,00:08:41.33,00:08:41.33,">> Good job, John. >> All we need is like 30 more."
130,00:08:46.50,00:08:46.50,">> Hey, you guys get out here. I'm serious!"
131,00:08:49.30,00:08:49.30,"(whistles) Look what I'm finding, these"
132,00:08:53.03,00:08:53.03,shells! Aah!
133,00:08:56.40,00:08:56.40,">> What did you find? >> Look! Oh, my God!"
134,00:09:00.93,00:09:00.93,We found thousands of these shells.
135,00:09:03.70,00:09:03.70,>> Kathy's borderline abrasive as far as her communication
136,00:09:08.53,00:09:08.53,style. And there's a little bit of
137,00:09:10.63,00:09:10.63,condescending behavior when she talks to people.
138,00:09:13.40,00:09:13.40,>> Let me explain so we do this right.
139,00:09:15.50,00:09:15.50,"They're under the rocks. So this is what I did, I flip"
140,00:09:17.90,00:09:17.90,one of these and there would be like two or three right there.
141,00:09:21.77,00:09:21.77,">> It was so exciting to see food, even though it was minute,"
142,00:09:26.40,00:09:26.40,I started losing it. It's tribal!
143,00:09:31.53,00:09:31.53,">> You got it, don't drop them whatever you do."
144,00:09:34.17,00:09:34.17,Way to go! And they were excited and they
145,00:09:38.83,00:09:38.83,came out and they were flipping rocks like mad trying to find
146,00:09:41.50,00:09:41.50,"them. >> We got seven-- one, two,"
147,00:09:44.50,00:09:44.50,"three, four. It spit at me."
148,00:09:47.83,00:09:47.83,"Is he even edible? >> It's a delicacy, I think"
149,00:09:51.27,00:09:51.27,"we've got a delicacy here. >> Inside, it was like a mixed"
150,00:09:54.53,00:09:54.53,"blessing for me. Great, I'm happy to have the"
151,00:09:57.00,00:09:57.00,protein. I just wish I would have been
152,00:09:58.97,00:09:58.97,the one to find it. >> We're going to be eating well
153,00:10:02.67,00:10:02.67,today. >> All you got to do is take off
154,00:10:09.40,00:10:09.40,the little black part. You pull out all the yucky
155,00:10:12.60,00:10:12.60,"stuff, like it's heart, I don't know what it really is, and then"
156,00:10:15.97,00:10:15.97,you just wipe off all this black stuff onto a leaf and you're
157,00:10:18.27,00:10:18.27,ready to go. >> That is just nasty.
158,00:10:20.47,00:10:20.47,>> Like snot. You want some slime?
159,00:10:23.57,00:10:23.57,>> We're going to chow down. This guy's moving.
160,00:10:28.93,00:10:28.93,>> Here's our lunch guys. How does it look?
161,00:10:31.17,00:10:31.17,">> It looks wonderful, absolutely delicious."
162,00:10:33.40,00:10:33.40,>> It looks great. >> I'm going back out there.
163,00:10:35.77,00:10:35.77,"Yeah, there's more food to be had."
164,00:10:37.90,00:10:37.90,">> You guys need one of these. >> Ew, oh, that was slimy."
165,00:10:43.90,00:10:43.90,">> There's something hard in there, you can't bite it."
166,00:10:46.97,00:10:46.97,">> Awesome. >> Oh, God, that is like the"
167,00:10:50.53,00:10:50.53,best thing ever. >> The seafood buffet lifted
168,00:10:52.87,00:10:52.87,"everybody's spirits up, and I thought, ""Well, this will give"
169,00:10:56.00,00:10:56.00,"me a point, you know. I won't get voted off now."
170,00:10:58.67,00:10:58.67,"I'm finding food."" But not once did they say ""Way"
171,00:11:02.30,00:11:02.30,"to go, Kath, thanks Kath."" Good thing the rocks got"
172,00:11:05.80,00:11:05.80,"overturned, guys. I got to tell you, you know what"
173,00:11:08.17,00:11:08.17,"you do, you just think outside the box."
174,00:11:09.90,00:11:09.90,Pat on the back? I didn't get one.
175,00:11:13.27,00:11:13.27,Weird. I mean I'm not that hard to get
176,00:11:15.30,00:11:15.30,"along with. >> Here's the plan, y'all get"
177,00:11:40.70,00:11:40.70,ready to go gather some coconuts and we're going to finish
178,00:11:43.23,00:11:43.23,letting these... >> How can we get coconuts
179,00:11:45.13,00:11:45.13,"without a stick? >> Well, he'll get you a stick."
180,00:11:47.30,00:11:47.30,"He's a great stick hunter. Work needs to get done, and if"
181,00:11:51.30,00:11:51.30,"somebody is not going to step up to the plate, I don't mind"
182,00:11:55.23,00:11:55.23,"telling somebody, ""Look, let's go."""
183,00:11:57.63,00:11:57.63,"What do you think? >> Well, one more layer of"
184,00:12:01.03,00:12:01.03,bigger flatter rocks. >> Isn't that what I just said?
185,00:12:02.90,00:12:02.90,"I want to know what you thought. >> That's what, I'm agreeing"
186,00:12:05.60,00:12:05.60,"with you is what I'm doing. >> Come on, come on!"
187,00:12:09.43,00:12:09.43,">> Patricia has some really great ideas, she loves to nag"
188,00:12:11.87,00:12:11.87,"me, you know, she loves to nag everybody."
189,00:12:13.63,00:12:13.63,I don't think that we necessarily always need the
190,00:12:15.73,00:12:15.73,"nagging, but I think that's Patricia."
191,00:12:17.33,00:12:17.33,She likes to do that. She's a mom and she's always
192,00:12:19.40,00:12:19.40,going to be a mom. >> Ya'll we need to put
193,00:12:21.23,00:12:21.23,"everything back where we get it. Look, this is the tool tree."
194,00:12:24.00,00:12:24.00,"We're going to leave the machetes here, and this is the"
195,00:12:26.53,00:12:26.53,"spear, you know, so we keep the tools."
196,00:12:29.87,00:12:29.87,">> She's doing too much talking to me, like, at first, it was"
197,00:12:33.00,00:12:33.00,endearing because it seemed natural.
198,00:12:34.87,00:12:34.87,"Now it seems like, ""Oh no, Mama got to work, Mama can't sit"
199,00:12:38.10,00:12:38.10,"down. >> Listen to me, I'm only going"
200,00:12:39.77,00:12:39.77,to tell you this once. >> I heard it this morning
201,00:12:41.93,00:12:41.93,already once. >> The tool tree.
202,00:12:43.60,00:12:43.60,>> I already know that. I know everything needs to go
203,00:12:47.20,00:12:47.20,back where you found it. >> Where's the knife then?
204,00:12:52.37,00:12:52.37,">> I think mama, a lot of her stuff is merely a show, with all"
205,00:12:56.00,00:12:56.00,this controlling-- now you make sure that fire stays lit.
206,00:12:59.23,00:12:59.23,I'm going to go get some more... That knife needs to be back over
207,00:13:02.27,00:13:02.27,there. That's just played out.
208,00:13:03.63,00:13:03.63,>> None us are children here. >> Right.
209,00:13:05.60,00:13:05.60,>> We didn't come here asking your mama and daddy every time
210,00:13:08.93,00:13:08.93,"you needed to do something. >> Right, and quite frankly, I,"
211,00:13:12.23,00:13:12.23,"you know, I'm getting sick of it."
212,00:13:13.97,00:13:13.97,>> It's nice to bond with somebody who understands.
213,00:13:17.37,00:13:17.37,"A lot of things are cultural. You know, there are certain"
214,00:13:19.50,00:13:19.50,things where black people we don't even have to finish
215,00:13:21.57,00:13:21.57,thoughts and we already know where we are.
216,00:13:24.07,00:13:24.07,"Aside from us, the other five are different, but the"
217,00:13:27.77,00:13:27.77,commonality that bonds them is that... is that.
218,00:13:34.07,00:13:34.07,>> Sean is what I call him Malcolm Farrakhan.
219,00:13:38.07,00:13:38.07,"He's got that Malcolm X militant type brother, and then he's got"
220,00:13:42.90,00:13:42.90,that real intelligent outspoken type of young man.
221,00:13:47.63,00:13:47.63,>> Even the fact that you and I sit here talking right now can
222,00:13:51.03,00:13:51.03,be perceived as that we're strategizing.
223,00:13:53.23,00:13:53.23,">> Strategizing, mm-hmm. >> Sometimes the game isn't"
224,00:13:57.03,00:13:57.03,"necessarily fair, because me and her playing a whole nother"
225,00:13:59.90,00:13:59.90,mental game that they don't even know.
226,00:14:01.80,00:14:01.80,"When you're a person of color and you're the only one, you"
227,00:14:05.10,00:14:05.10,"have to play, and that's something they don't even have"
228,00:14:07.53,00:14:07.53,"to worry about. See, everybody can just be"
229,00:14:08.90,00:14:08.90,"themselves. We have to be ourselves, but"
230,00:14:10.43,00:14:10.43,"then hold back a little bit. And on top of that, she believes"
231,00:14:13.23,00:14:13.23,"in God, I believe in God and we're bound by Christ and that's"
232,00:14:16.43,00:14:16.43,"a stronger bond, stronger than race, stronger than anything."
233,00:14:20.13,00:14:20.13,>> I can just tell what people are going to say.
234,00:14:22.60,00:14:22.60,">> Yeah, like those two ungrateful Negroes."
235,00:14:25.70,00:14:25.70,"I mean, you take them on an island and they still complain."
236,00:14:29.03,00:14:29.03,"I mean, where's your Al Sharpton now?"
237,00:14:31.13,00:14:31.13,He's not going to come out on the beach and just...
238,00:15:11.53,00:15:11.53,>> We have some people here that want to seriously play this game
239,00:15:15.60,00:15:15.60,and survive. I think others are here because
240,00:15:18.23,00:15:18.23,they think it's a vacation. >> Sean seems so strong
241,00:15:24.63,00:15:24.63,"physically when you look at him you're thinking, ""Man the guy"
242,00:15:27.13,00:15:27.13,"is, you know, he's going to be strong for us, he's going to do"
243,00:15:29.60,00:15:29.60,"this and that. But he, he's lazy."
244,00:15:33.00,00:15:33.00,Need to go on another water run. Sean's going to do that whether
245,00:15:36.80,00:15:36.80,he likes it or not. >> I love everybody in the
246,00:15:42.37,00:15:42.37,"tribe, but Sean just doesn't seem to want to carry his"
247,00:15:45.23,00:15:45.23,weight. I think this one is empty.
248,00:15:46.73,00:15:46.73,"When you're done with that, would you mind running up there"
249,00:15:49.20,00:15:49.20,and doing it? I'm just a little beat.
250,00:15:50.77,00:15:50.77,>> Not at all. >> I don't like Sean.
251,00:16:03.40,00:16:03.40,I just wish he'd work a little bit more.
252,00:16:06.33,00:16:06.33,>> Being that everybody seems to feel strongly about Hunter being
253,00:16:09.73,00:16:09.73,"the leader, everybody is gravitating towards him to make"
254,00:16:12.67,00:16:12.67,sure he sees what they do and their value and let me get cool
255,00:16:15.83,00:16:15.83,with Hunter. And that's all part of the game.
256,00:16:18.17,00:16:18.17,"But I'm not going to do it. In the interest of us surviving,"
257,00:16:21.90,00:16:21.90,we are a team. So if I'm needed to go get
258,00:16:24.17,00:16:24.17,"water, I'm going to get it. But it's like I ain't kissing"
259,00:16:27.13,00:16:27.13,nobody's butt and I'm going to tell you that right now.
260,00:16:37.33,00:16:37.33,">> Gina, here's another one. >> Where are Rob and Sarah?"
261,00:16:43.47,00:16:43.47,>> You should have to say where's one of them and then you
262,00:16:46.73,00:16:46.73,know where the other one is. >> I call them Frik and Frak.
263,00:16:50.30,00:16:50.30,>> Barbie and Ken. >> Me and Rob have more in
264,00:16:54.50,00:16:54.50,"common than we do with anybody else, so we just happen to want"
265,00:16:58.30,00:16:58.30,to hang out together. We're the two youngest people in
266,00:17:01.63,00:17:01.63,the tribe and we laugh at each other's jokes and have a good
267,00:17:05.23,00:17:05.23,"time. I'm definitely attracted to Rob,"
268,00:17:07.27,00:17:07.27,"and him the same, he's told me the same."
269,00:17:09.37,00:17:09.37,">> Sarah pulls Rob away from his duties, if Rob lays down, Sarah"
270,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,"lays down. If Rob goes in the water, Sarah"
271,00:17:16.57,00:17:16.57,goes in the water. I think that if Sarah were to
272,00:17:19.43,00:17:19.43,"go, we may see more productivity out of Rob."
273,00:17:32.10,00:17:32.10,>> Pretty much the only game I got going on is with Sarah and
274,00:17:36.70,00:17:36.70,"that cuts both ways. At times, she can be an asset"
275,00:17:40.00,00:17:40.00,"because, basically, she'll vote whatever way I tell her to vote,"
276,00:17:43.67,00:17:43.67,"but, at other times, it's like I'm playing Survivor for two."
277,00:17:46.33,00:17:46.33,"I have to constantly be watching her, because she's not really"
278,00:17:49.63,00:17:49.63,doing too much around here. You have to do work.
279,00:17:53.47,00:17:53.47,>> I have been. >> I know. I know.
280,00:17:58.03,00:17:58.03,You don't understand these people.
281,00:18:01.00,00:18:01.00,You know what I'm saying? Just make sure they know that
282,00:18:04.03,00:18:04.03,"you're doing something. I picked her for a reason,"
283,00:18:08.47,00:18:08.47,"because it's like if I have one vote, I really have two votes as"
284,00:18:12.90,00:18:12.90,"long as I have her along. (snorting, grunting)"
285,00:18:26.13,00:18:26.13,>> You know something good's going to happen tonight.
286,00:18:28.10,00:18:28.10,We're either going to catch a pig or we are going to starve.
287,00:18:31.27,00:18:31.27,">> I'm thinking about bacon man, that sounds so good."
288,00:18:36.53,00:18:36.53,">> I'm, like, totally stoked. It worked."
289,00:18:40.03,00:18:40.03,"We just got to do it better. So we build this snare, and the"
290,00:18:43.83,00:18:43.83,"pig sets it off, we don't catch the pig."
291,00:18:46.03,00:18:46.03,>> That's a big track right there.
292,00:18:48.63,00:18:48.63,">> Inside, I was like bummed. It's like going out fishing and"
293,00:18:51.87,00:18:51.87,"having a fish take your worm, I mean, it simply was as close as"
294,00:18:54.80,00:18:54.80,that. >> We need more than three
295,00:18:59.80,00:18:59.80,people to go get water. (whistling)
296,00:19:01.30,00:19:01.30,">> Uh, oh, they found something. >> I want to have a little"
297,00:19:05.10,00:19:05.10,meeting to introduce my goodies. It's good news.
298,00:19:09.80,00:19:09.80,It was almost like a mother holding a chocolate bar saying
299,00:19:14.80,00:19:14.80,"""You can have this chocolate bar, but you have to listen to"
300,00:19:18.17,00:19:18.17,"me first and do as I say."" >> So this is what I want from"
301,00:19:21.13,00:19:21.13,"you guys, I am going to find you food, I'm good at this for some"
302,00:19:24.20,00:19:24.20,reason. I think it's because I grew up
303,00:19:25.60,00:19:25.60,"around the ocean, but there are two things that I just think"
304,00:19:27.70,00:19:27.70,that we're not doing correctly. The fire and that shelter is not
305,00:19:31.90,00:19:31.90,good. Everybody was sleeping under
306,00:19:33.40,00:19:33.40,"there, they were asleep, I didn't have a place to sleep."
307,00:19:35.67,00:19:35.67,">> I'd be glad to move over as far as you wanted to, you said"
308,00:19:38.53,00:19:38.53,"no, I don't need any more, this is all I need."
309,00:19:40.70,00:19:40.70,">> All I want is a roof over my head, and I want to feed you"
310,00:19:43.47,00:19:43.47,"because I want us to win. >> Great job, Kath."
311,00:19:49.13,00:19:49.13,">> So this is what I'm saying, we each have a role."
312,00:19:51.53,00:19:51.53,">> I think it's great that you found where the food was, but I"
313,00:19:54.03,00:19:54.03,don't think that any of us should slip into one role.
314,00:19:57.63,00:19:57.63,>> I'm just saying that we don't know each other's...
315,00:20:00.00,00:20:00.00,I don't even know what Paschal does.
316,00:20:01.63,00:20:01.63,">> Well, Kathy, then, why don't you talk to us?"
317,00:20:03.37,00:20:03.37,Stop going off by yourself. We're also trying to be a
318,00:20:06.17,00:20:06.17,society. Why don't you know anything
319,00:20:08.73,00:20:08.73,about us? >> I do know some.
320,00:20:10.77,00:20:10.77,I've been looking for food. >> There's more going on here
321,00:20:13.67,00:20:13.67,"than building a shelter and getting food, there's a lot more"
322,00:20:15.77,00:20:15.77,going on than making sure we have water and making sure we
323,00:20:18.23,00:20:18.23,have fire. >> All I want is a roof over my
324,00:20:20.17,00:20:20.17,head. >> That's not all that I want.
325,00:20:21.80,00:20:21.80,I want to know you. I'd rather get to know you
326,00:20:23.67,00:20:23.67,before I had a shelter. >> You guys are all over me for
327,00:20:26.20,00:20:26.20,just asking for that. >> I was totally taken off-guard
328,00:20:29.07,00:20:29.07,that they bit back so hard. They bit back real hard.
329,00:20:32.70,00:20:32.70,To the point where I was almost in tears.
330,00:20:35.10,00:20:35.10,>> What aspect of us being out here worries you the most?
331,00:20:37.27,00:20:37.27,Having a shelter over your head? Then I'll do my best to assuage
332,00:20:40.50,00:20:40.50,"your worries. This is an adventure, not just a"
333,00:20:43.33,00:20:43.33,hardship. >> Okay.
334,00:20:44.47,00:20:44.47,">> She kind of started to get tears in her eyes, and I felt"
335,00:20:48.37,00:20:48.37,bad. Our point here isn't to make
336,00:20:50.23,00:20:50.23,anybody feel bad or hurt anybody's feelings.
337,00:20:52.70,00:20:52.70,">> We decided it was past time for a shelter, and it was a"
338,00:20:57.53,00:20:57.53,"priority for Kathy, so we made it a priority for the group."
339,00:21:01.17,00:21:01.17,">> I have an idea, let's cut it open."
340,00:21:04.57,00:21:04.57,>> It's nice to have something we can all sleep under together
341,00:21:07.87,00:21:07.87,and not worry about the elements.
342,00:21:09.63,00:21:09.63,">> All right, guys, this is a very special moment."
343,00:21:12.53,00:21:12.53,">> Yes it is. >> As my luxury item, I chose"
344,00:21:15.10,00:21:15.10,the American flag because I'm extremely patriotic.
345,00:21:18.73,00:21:18.73,>> This is cool. >> It's just such a wonderful
346,00:21:21.70,00:21:21.70,symbol of what this group is about.
347,00:21:23.97,00:21:23.97,Just makes me feel good to look at it.
348,00:21:27.03,00:21:27.03,It really does. >> Thank you so much.
349,00:21:29.60,00:21:29.60,>> No worries. I did it for all of us.
350,00:21:31.93,00:21:31.93,>> I am at peace now. >> The postman has arrived!

354,00:22:03.63,00:22:03.63,challenge is for a reward. Here's how it works.
355,00:22:06.47,00:22:06.47,There are two boats sitting on the bottom of the ocean floor
356,00:22:09.30,00:22:09.30,with about 250 rocks inside each boat.
357,00:22:11.43,00:22:11.43,"tubes, one for each tribe."

361,00:22:22.43,00:22:22.43,"Once you determine as a tribe that your boat is seaworthy,"
362,00:22:25.63,00:22:25.63,it's a race to the beach. First tribe to get their boat
363,00:22:28.23,00:22:28.23,back to their mat wins reward. Clear?
364,00:22:30.83,00:22:30.83,>> Clear. >> JEFF: Want to know what
365,00:22:32.20,00:22:32.20,you're playing for? >> Yeah!

442,00:30:14.47,00:30:14.47,Here's how it's made. You take fish bones and crab
443,00:30:17.67,00:30:17.67,legs and lobster legs and you make a marinade by letting it
444,00:30:21.43,00:30:21.43,rot in seawater for three days. You then take the stinking
445,00:30:25.00,00:30:25.00,marinade and pour it over slices of fish and let it stand in the
446,00:30:28.43,00:30:28.43,"baking sun for a couple hours. As you can tell, even from where"
447,00:30:31.60,00:30:31.60,"you're standing, this stuff smells worse than a public"

554,00:38:22.83,00:38:22.83,"told me what to do in eight years, so it's hard to take"
555,00:38:26.03,00:38:26.03,"sometimes, but you just kind of bite your tongue and continue."
556,00:38:30.27,00:38:30.27,">> JEFF: Sean, do you guys have a daily routine?"
557,00:38:33.23,00:38:33.23,">> Yeah, we do. I feel like I didn't leave work,"
558,00:38:37.00,00:38:37.00,"man. Soon as we get up, we know"
559,00:38:38.67,00:38:38.67,"things need to be done, but it's wearing my energy down, quite"
560,00:38:42.47,00:38:42.47,frankly. >> JEFF: Sarah?
561,00:38:43.70,00:38:43.70,">> I work 16 hour days when I'm at home, I didn't come here to"
562,00:38:46.40,00:38:46.40,do that. >> JEFF: What did you come
563,00:38:47.80,00:38:47.80,here to do? >> I came here to play the game
564,00:38:49.50,00:38:49.50,and meet cool people and have this adventure.
565,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,"I mean, we're definitely working."
566,00:38:52.40,00:38:52.40,I will admit I do less of the work.
567,00:38:53.90,00:38:53.90,I'm trying to save my energy. I don't want to personally be
568,00:38:56.50,00:38:56.50,the one to lose a challenge because I don't have enough
569,00:38:58.90,00:38:58.90,energy. >> I totally disagree.
570,00:39:00.30,00:39:00.30,If I expend more energy to take up for somebody who's not
571,00:39:02.90,00:39:02.90,"working, then when I go to the challenge, I'm going to be twice"
572,00:39:05.80,00:39:05.80,"as weak as I should be, because I had to pull somebody else's"
573,00:39:08.67,00:39:08.67,weight. >> JEFF: So let's talk about
574,00:39:10.20,00:39:10.20,"the challenges. Hunter, sports analogy, you're"
575,00:39:12.13,00:39:12.13,"the captain, 0 for three cannot set sit well with you."
576,00:39:15.20,00:39:15.20,">> We've been skunked so far. We've had a couple tough breaks,"
577,00:39:17.87,00:39:17.87,and we're still holding our head high.
578,00:39:19.50,00:39:19.50,"We'll come back and take it to them, so..."
579,00:39:21.80,00:39:21.80,">> JEFF: Rob, let talk about the immunity challenge today."
580,00:39:24.60,00:39:24.60,>> I was very discouraged and I feel like I let my team down in
581,00:39:28.43,00:39:28.43,"a way, and this may be my night. >> JEFF: Do you think it would"
582,00:39:31.80,00:39:31.80,be fair to vote you out tonight? >> If people want to vote me out
583,00:39:34.93,00:39:34.93,"tonight, I could understand why, yes."
584,00:39:36.87,00:39:36.87,">> JEFF: It's time to vote. Patricia, you're first."
585,00:40:08.50,00:40:08.50,>> My vote tonight is for Patricia.
586,00:40:11.73,00:40:11.73,"She's a great person, but the mom thing is getting pretty old"
587,00:40:15.53,00:40:15.53,"in the camp, so she's got to go. I wish her the best of luck."
588,00:40:39.67,00:40:39.67,">> Sarah, I'm sorry, you know I love you, but the beach party is"
589,00:40:44.27,00:40:44.27,"over. We got to work hard, we got to"
590,00:40:45.93,00:40:45.93,challenge hard and I just think you're being a distraction.
591,00:40:55.10,00:40:55.10,>> JEFF: I'll go tally the votes.
592,00:41:09.07,00:41:09.07,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
593,00:41:11.67,00:41:11.67,The person will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
594,00:41:14.17,00:41:14.17,immediately. I'll read the votes.
595,00:41:16.70,00:41:16.70,First vote... Sarah.
596,00:41:24.60,00:41:24.60,Mama. Sarah.
597,00:41:33.03,00:41:33.03,"Patricia, Mom. Two votes Sarah, two votes Mom."
598,00:41:41.37,00:41:41.37,Sarah. Patricia.
599,00:41:47.80,00:41:47.80,"We're tied, three votes Sarah, three votes Mom."
600,00:41:51.23,00:41:51.23,Last vote. Mom.
601,00:41:55.00,00:41:55.00,"You need to bring me your torch, Patricia."
602,00:42:07.90,00:42:07.90,"Patricia, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
603,00:42:22.60,00:42:22.60,I've heard a lot tonight. This is clearly a tribe divided.
604,00:42:26.23,00:42:26.23,You guys can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow.
605,00:42:39.83,00:42:39.83,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
606,00:42:44.50,00:42:44.50,>> JEFF: Next time on Survivor: Tensions heat up at Maraamu.
607,00:42:47.67,00:42:47.67,>> Please don't be sensitive about this.
608,00:42:49.23,00:42:49.23,">> Apparently, I have to be. >> No, you don't."
609,00:42:51.20,00:42:51.20,">> Apparently, I have to be. >> There's just too much drama"
610,00:42:54.37,00:42:54.37,"in this place! >> JEFF: At Rotu, the love"
611,00:42:56.60,00:42:56.60,"tribe gets a lesson in pain. >> Let me see, let me see, Rob."
612,00:42:59.20,00:42:59.20,">> Pain, you know, you got to deal with it."
613,00:43:00.83,00:43:00.83,>> Things change just like that out here.
614,00:43:10.40,00:43:10.40,>> I know why I got voted off tonight.
615,00:43:12.93,00:43:12.93,I have no ill feelings. I want y'all to come together as
616,00:43:16.20,00:43:16.20,a team and win these things and come out on top.
617,00:43:18.67,00:43:18.67,I'm proud of each and every other one of you.
618,00:43:21.17,00:43:21.17,And I made some wonderful friendships and I hope they last
619,00:43:25.10,00:43:25.10,for a while. I had a great time and I'd do it
620,00:43:27.93,00:43:27.93,again. Love you!
