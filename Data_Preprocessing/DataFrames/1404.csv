66,00:03:07.29,00:03:07.29,worried about his vote.Right now I could care less
67,00:03:09.17,00:03:09.17,"about his vote.For some reason, Anthony, you"

73,00:03:24.08,00:03:24.08,while that drives me nuts.I don't usually deal with people
74,00:03:27.04,00:03:27.04,"like that unless it's a broad--no offense to ladies, that's how"
75,00:03:29.96,00:03:29.96,I talk to girls-- unless it's agirl or it's my mother or it's

81,00:03:46.08,00:03:46.08,sorry I irritate you.I have no idea what I'm doing to
82,00:03:48.12,00:03:48.12,you that's irritating you.I've spent a lot of my life with

111,00:07:06.21,00:07:06.21,"no fun either.But gee whiz, this is just..."
112,00:07:08.71,00:07:08.71,the head spinning is just... Ican't... you can't function.
113,00:07:24.79,00:07:24.79,">> Everybody loves Gary in thetribe, and definitely want him"
114,00:07:27.12,00:07:27.12,"to keep competing if he feelsgood enough, but I think he"
115,00:07:29.38,00:07:29.38,"should take his health first.At his age, the amount of stress"
116,00:07:32.83,00:07:32.83,and possibly high bloodpressure... I want him to feel
117,00:07:36.08,00:07:36.08,"better, first of all.>> You have so many bites, Gary."
118,00:07:40.04,00:07:40.04,>> Mm-hmm.You've got thousands of them.
119,00:07:43.75,00:07:43.75,"Gary does not look good at all,and eventually it's going to"

125,00:08:00.12,00:08:00.12,I really don't want to take careof him.
126,00:08:02.38,00:08:02.38,I don't want to babysit.So let's hope he gets better.
127,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,That's the only thing I can say.If he doesn't get better he's

507,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,I don't think you can ignore theinterpersonal relationships that
508,00:32:50.12,00:32:50.12,"have been built, not becauseit's a friendship, but it's also"
509,00:32:52.54,00:32:52.54,"in thinking long-term, that bondmay help you in the future."
510,00:32:56.50,00:32:56.50,>> We're not individuals yet.We're still a group.
511,00:32:59.08,00:32:59.08,>> Dreamz started freaking out.I think he shoots from the hip a
512,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,"lot, and he's a bit naive.Because he has no clue what's"
513,00:33:04.62,00:33:04.62,going on.He thinks we're all part of this
514,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,"solid team, that we do thingstogether in stride."
515,00:33:10.75,00:33:10.75,"And it's not entirely untrue,it's just that the team consists"
516,00:33:14.92,00:33:14.92,"of five people-- myself, Alex,Ed, Lisi, and Boo."
517,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,">> If anybody else got somethingto say, please."

523,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,We don't have to eat each otheryet.
524,00:33:41.21,00:33:41.21,We don't have to do that yet.Let's not do it yet.

526,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,fair so we don't have to see thesnake so early.

528,00:34:01.17,00:34:01.17,"like you and we don't thinkyou're a good person, because I"

532,00:34:10.79,00:34:10.79,game longer.>> Yeah.
533,00:34:12.29,00:34:12.29,"All I'll say is just, you know,hang in there."
534,00:34:14.17,00:34:14.17,It could be me going home thisevening after tribal council.
535,00:34:16.46,00:34:16.46,But I don't want to be the firstvoted out of my tribe.
536,00:34:18.92,00:34:18.92,I didn't want to be the firstvoted out of the game.
537,00:34:20.79,00:34:20.79,So I'm holding on.>> I think Dreamz is better for
538,00:34:41.58,00:34:41.58,"us, so we need to keep Dreamz.>> We need to keep Dreamz, okay?"
539,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,">> I vote Liliana, too.>> Let's do it."
540,00:34:52.04,00:34:52.04,"She's going to be like...As far as I'm concerned, Liliana"
541,00:34:56.04,00:34:56.04,is the weakest link.Because our biggest concern is
542,00:34:59.00,00:34:59.00,"to get to the top five, andshe's the one person that could"
543,00:35:01.04,00:35:01.04,threaten it.She could try to manipulate
544,00:35:03.17,00:35:03.17,things.She could say all sorts of
545,00:35:05.46,00:35:05.46,things that could start tearingus apart.
546,00:35:07.62,00:35:07.62,>> If we take out Liliana...Cassandra is bad at everything.
547,00:35:10.54,00:35:10.54,She sucks at everything.>> It's not... we're not going
548,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,to be hurting.I swear to you.
549,00:35:17.00,00:35:17.00,">> The most logical thing is tokeep Liliana, vote out Cassandra"
550,00:35:20.04,00:35:20.04,until we have a numbersadvantage again.
551,00:35:22.79,00:35:22.79,Right now we're 7-7.Why on god's green earth would
552,00:35:25.83,00:35:25.83,"you vote out a woman who is asstrong, almost as any of the"
553,00:35:28.46,00:35:28.46,men?That to me seems absurd.
554,00:35:30.71,00:35:30.71,>> One of them has got to go.>> I'm voting Liliana.
555,00:35:33.71,00:35:33.71,">> Me, too.>> I'm very frustrated."
556,00:35:35.62,00:35:35.62,I feel like this is illogical.I want to do what's best for our
557,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,five-person alliance and for theteam in general.
558,00:35:40.46,00:35:40.46,Liliana is a good person.She's worked hard at these
559,00:35:44.21,00:35:44.21,challenges.She deserves to stay.
