3,00:00:05.21,00:00:05.21,"Hurry, hurry. >> This is going too great."
4,00:00:06.96,00:00:06.96,">> Yeah, it's, like, too good to be true, man."
5,00:00:08.75,00:00:08.75,>> PROBST: Moto continued to grow stronger.
6,00:00:10.62,00:00:10.62,">> It's not even survival, it's thrival."
7,00:00:14.71,00:00:14.71,>> PROBST: While Ravu became weaker and weaker.
8,00:00:19.21,00:00:19.21,Until the sun came out-- then Ravu transformed its rays into
9,00:00:22.46,00:00:22.46,fire. >> Awesome!
10,00:00:27.08,00:00:27.08,>> We're not going to die! >> PROBST: At the reward
11,00:00:30.54,00:00:30.54,"challenge, Gary took a hard fall, but Moto still came out"
12,00:00:34.21,00:00:34.21,ahead. >> Dre scores for Moto!
13,00:00:37.83,00:00:37.83,>> PROBST: Giving Moto more fishing gear and widening the
14,00:00:40.42,00:00:40.42,gap between the two tribes. >> Sylvia.
15,00:00:43.25,00:00:43.25,>> PROBST: Sylvia was sent to Exile Island where she received
16,00:00:45.88,00:00:45.88,a pivotal clue to the whereabouts of the idol hidden
17,00:00:48.33,00:00:48.33,"back at camp. >> ""You'll find it under the"
18,00:00:51.33,00:00:51.33,"cave's threshold if you dig deep."""
19,00:00:53.88,00:00:53.88,I need to figure out a time and a place to look for the idol as
20,00:00:56.04,00:00:56.04,quickly as possible. >> PROBST: At Moto...
21,00:00:59.04,00:00:59.04,>> He can't breathe. >> PROBST: ...Gary was beginning
22,00:01:01.17,00:01:01.17,to feel ill. >> We're going to keep a close
23,00:01:03.17,00:01:03.17,eye on him. His health is more important
24,00:01:04.83,00:01:04.83,than the game to us. >> PROBST: But at the immunity
25,00:01:07.12,00:01:07.12,challenge... Papa Smurf starting on his
26,00:01:09.71,00:01:09.71,second snout. Gary pulled through when Anthony
27,00:01:12.33,00:01:12.33,was unable to chew a pig snout. Moto wins immunity again!
28,00:01:18.21,00:01:18.21,"Before tribal council... >> Does he irk you at all, or"
29,00:01:22.00,00:01:22.00,no? He seems a little on the whiny
30,00:01:24.33,00:01:24.33,side. >> PROBST: ...Anthony and Sylvia
31,00:01:26.33,00:01:26.33,"were both on the hot seat, and Sylvia's only hope was finding"
32,00:01:29.71,00:01:29.71,the hidden immunity idol. >> If I get the idol and if the
33,00:01:33.25,00:01:33.25,"vote does go my way, I will be able to surprise everybody."
34,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,">> PROBST: At tribal council, Anthony questioned his position"
35,00:01:39.92,00:01:39.92,in the tribe. >> I often wonder if these folks
36,00:01:43.04,00:01:43.04,"even like me. I like to think they like me,"
37,00:01:45.08,00:01:45.08,"but, you know, sometimes you can't tell."
38,00:01:47.08,00:01:47.08,">> PROBST: Mookie, what's your thought on what Anthony said?"
39,00:01:49.17,00:01:49.17,">> After the challenge, I was really pissed off."
40,00:01:52.25,00:01:52.25,"When you take a little piece of snout this small, you can will"
41,00:01:55.62,00:01:55.62,yourself to throw it down. >> PROBST: But when Sylvia
42,00:01:58.12,00:01:58.12,"failed to produce the idol, she was voted out of the game."
43,00:02:01.00,00:02:01.00,"Sylvia, the tribe has spoken. 16 are left."
44,00:02:05.38,00:02:05.38,Who will be voted out tonight? >> We going to start a fire or
45,00:02:21.17,00:02:21.17,what? >> Yeah.
46,00:02:23.42,00:02:23.42,>> Let's just get the fire going.
47,00:02:25.25,00:02:25.25,"We will talk about whatever needs to be talked about, get it"
48,00:02:27.04,00:02:27.04,all out. Just all this silly stuff just
49,00:02:28.92,00:02:28.92,"has to go. When we came back to camp, I"
50,00:02:31.92,00:02:31.92,"wanted us all to have a powwow. I mean, people have problems"
51,00:02:36.42,00:02:36.42,"with certain people, personality problems, and they don't say"
52,00:02:38.79,00:02:38.79,anything. So that other person doesn't
53,00:02:41.04,00:02:41.04,know. So this just keeps on going and
54,00:02:42.96,00:02:42.96,pressure builds up and then people explode.
55,00:02:45.42,00:02:45.42,We'll start talking. >> All of us start talking?
56,00:02:47.46,00:02:47.46,">> Start talking, man. >> Start talking."
57,00:02:49.25,00:02:49.25,What would you like to talk about?
58,00:02:50.75,00:02:50.75,>> Start talking. >> I don't want to be involved
59,00:02:52.25,00:02:52.25,in bitching and moaning and screaming.
60,00:02:54.00,00:02:54.00,">> Certain people want to bitch and moan, though."
61,00:02:55.58,00:02:55.58,">> But guy, that's all he ( no audio ) does."
62,00:02:57.12,00:02:57.12,">> Reacting like that, that's just..."
63,00:02:58.83,00:02:58.83,">> Reacting like what? >> Just chill, for real."
64,00:03:00.46,00:03:00.46,">> You have no idea how much I'm holding back, especially with"
65,00:03:02.92,00:03:02.92,"Anthony, you know what I mean? Sitting around dealing with"
66,00:03:05.33,00:03:05.33,somebody you really can't tell him how you feel because you're
67,00:03:07.29,00:03:07.29,worried about his vote. Right now I could care less
68,00:03:09.17,00:03:09.17,"about his vote. For some reason, Anthony, you"
69,00:03:11.21,00:03:11.21,consistently irritate the ( no audio ) out of me all the ( no
70,00:03:14.50,00:03:14.50,audio ) time. And I think you go out of your
71,00:03:16.58,00:03:16.58,way to do it. I think you go out of your way
72,00:03:18.79,00:03:18.79,"to do it. I think, for some reason, for"
73,00:03:21.04,00:03:21.04,"some strange reason, you play the sympathy case once in a"
74,00:03:24.08,00:03:24.08,while that drives me nuts. I don't usually deal with people
75,00:03:27.04,00:03:27.04,"like that unless it's a broad-- no offense to ladies, that's how"
76,00:03:29.96,00:03:29.96,I talk to girls-- unless it's a girl or it's my mother or it's
77,00:03:32.58,00:03:32.58,"my crazy aunt. Everybody messes up, but when"
78,00:03:36.04,00:03:36.04,"you whine about something or you get all, like... you get all,"
79,00:03:38.75,00:03:38.75,"like, sentimental and sensitive... you're a man."
80,00:03:42.04,00:03:42.04,"At least, the way I was raised, I'm a man, I've got to act like"
81,00:03:44.04,00:03:44.04,"one. >> I'm sorry I irk you, and I'm"
82,00:03:46.08,00:03:46.08,sorry I irritate you. I have no idea what I'm doing to
83,00:03:48.12,00:03:48.12,you that's irritating you. I've spent a lot of my life with
84,00:03:51.08,00:03:51.08,"very little self-esteem. You know, I got picked on as a"
85,00:03:54.17,00:03:54.17,"kid, and I guess I developed a whole lot of self-loathing."
86,00:03:57.79,00:03:57.79,>> I got along with Jessica. I got along with Erica.
87,00:04:01.17,00:04:01.17,"Those two people are gone, and you're still here driving me"
88,00:04:03.71,00:04:03.71,"absolutely insane. Both of those girls, better"
89,00:04:06.29,00:04:06.29,players than you. No offense.
90,00:04:08.58,00:04:08.58,"Some people have it, some people don't."
91,00:04:10.50,00:04:10.50,">> I may not be doing the best in the challenges, but if they"
92,00:04:13.29,00:04:13.29,"want me off this island, they want me out of this game,"
93,00:04:17.29,00:04:17.29,they're going to have to push me off.
94,00:04:19.08,00:04:19.08,Because there's no way in hell I'm giving up.
95,00:05:45.04,00:05:45.04,">> Wow, I'm in Fiji. This is gorgeous."
96,00:05:48.12,00:05:48.12,It's absolutely breathtaking. And at night with the moon is
97,00:05:50.62,00:05:50.62,out... >> Which makes our thing so
98,00:05:57.92,00:05:57.92,"perfect, you know? >> Right."
99,00:06:00.21,00:06:00.21,Yeah. The five musketeers.
100,00:06:03.21,00:06:03.21,">> From the beginning there has been a bond between Boo, Alex,"
101,00:06:08.88,00:06:08.88,"Edgar, myself, and Stacy. It's almost been unspoken."
102,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,All we know is that the five of us get along and we're not
103,00:06:16.00,00:06:16.00,stepping on each other's toes. We all kind of come together.
104,00:06:19.38,00:06:19.38,"It's just amazing how things have just, like, fallen into"
105,00:06:22.21,00:06:22.21,place. >> The other team must be
106,00:06:24.46,00:06:24.46,kicking their asses right now. >> That's the way the cookie
107,00:06:27.12,00:06:27.12,crumbles. >> This water is awesome!
108,00:06:29.50,00:06:29.50,I just want that cloud to go away.
109,00:06:46.12,00:06:46.12,>> So Gary... >> Mm-hmm.
110,00:07:01.17,00:07:01.17,>> I've done a lot of miserable things in my life.
111,00:07:03.79,00:07:03.79,"I mean, I did a tour of Vietnam and we had some crap that wasn't"
112,00:07:06.21,00:07:06.21,"no fun either. But gee whiz, this is just..."
113,00:07:08.71,00:07:08.71,the head spinning is just... I can't... you can't function.
114,00:07:24.79,00:07:24.79,">> Everybody loves Gary in the tribe, and definitely want him"
115,00:07:27.12,00:07:27.12,"to keep competing if he feels good enough, but I think he"
116,00:07:29.38,00:07:29.38,"should take his health first. At his age, the amount of stress"
117,00:07:32.83,00:07:32.83,and possibly high blood pressure... I want him to feel
118,00:07:36.08,00:07:36.08,"better, first of all. >> You have so many bites, Gary."
119,00:07:40.04,00:07:40.04,>> Mm-hmm. You've got thousands of them.
120,00:07:43.75,00:07:43.75,"Gary does not look good at all, and eventually it's going to"
121,00:07:47.79,00:07:47.79,"turn into, like, a babysitting situation."
122,00:07:50.21,00:07:50.21,"It's like, ""Okay, you know, did I just have a baby and didn't"
123,00:07:53.88,00:07:53.88,"realize it?"" Did you have some of that"
124,00:07:56.12,00:07:56.12,coconut meat? >> Mm-hmm.
125,00:07:58.25,00:07:58.25,">> You should have some, have plenty."
126,00:08:00.12,00:08:00.12,I really don't want to take care of him.
127,00:08:02.38,00:08:02.38,I don't want to babysit. So let's hope he gets better.
128,00:08:06.17,00:08:06.17,That's the only thing I can say. If he doesn't get better he's
129,00:08:09.08,00:08:09.08,"going have to go. >> PROBST: Moto, come on in!"
130,00:08:29.33,00:08:29.33,"Ravu, come on in! Moto getting your first look at"
131,00:08:32.42,00:08:32.42,the new Ravu tribe. Sylvia voted out at the last
132,00:08:35.25,00:08:35.25,tribal council. >> Whoa.
133,00:08:39.62,00:08:39.62,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
134,00:08:42.75,00:08:42.75,">> Yep. >> Yeah, we are."
135,00:08:44.92,00:08:44.92,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, both tribes will line"
136,00:08:48.33,00:08:48.33,up side by side on a very narrow balance beam over water.
137,00:08:52.12,00:08:52.12,"Moving one tribe member at a time, you must make your way"
138,00:08:55.46,00:08:55.46,"across the beam, stepping around your tribemates as you go."
139,00:08:59.83,00:08:59.83,"If you fall off, or if you are knocked off, you go back to the"
140,00:09:03.00,00:09:03.00,"start. Once you get off the beam, onto"
141,00:09:07.25,00:09:07.25,"the finish platform, then the next tribe member goes."
142,00:09:11.17,00:09:11.17,"You can change your crossing order mid challenge, but you"
143,00:09:13.92,00:09:13.92,have to jump in the water to do so.
144,00:09:16.38,00:09:16.38,"First tribe to get all their tribemates offof the beam,"
145,00:09:20.04,00:09:20.04,"on to the finish platform, win reward."
146,00:09:22.25,00:09:22.25,Want to know what you're playing for?
147,00:09:24.00,00:09:24.00,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: It's another big one.
148,00:09:26.79,00:09:26.79,">> Oh, man! >> PROBST: Whole lot of fish."
149,00:09:32.00,00:09:32.00,">> Fish, yeah. >> PROBST: Plenty of rice."
150,00:09:36.08,00:09:36.08,Spices to liven up everything you eat.
151,00:09:39.50,00:09:39.50,"Plus some comfort-- pillows, blankets."
152,00:09:42.12,00:09:42.12,That's not all. Waiting back at camp for the
153,00:09:44.71,00:09:44.71,"winning tribe, a king-sized bed with sheets and pillows."
154,00:09:49.54,00:09:49.54,"In addition, the winning tribe will send one member from the"
155,00:09:54.33,00:09:54.33,"losing tribe to Exile Island. Moto, you have two extra"
156,00:09:56.88,00:09:56.88,members. Who are you going to sit out?
157,00:09:59.38,00:09:59.38,">> Cassandra and Papa Smurf. >> PROBST: Gary and Cassandra,"
158,00:10:02.04,00:10:02.04,sitting this one out. Swim out.
159,00:10:04.25,00:10:04.25,"We'll get started. Once you guys are set, you"
160,00:10:12.04,00:10:12.04,cannot be holding onto each other.
161,00:10:14.25,00:10:14.25,The only person you can touch is the person that's crossing you.
162,00:10:17.25,00:10:17.25,The wind is starting to pick up. Perfect time to begin this
163,00:10:20.42,00:10:20.42,challenge. Survivors ready?
164,00:10:23.17,00:10:23.17,Go. Michelle for Ravu makes her way
165,00:10:26.54,00:10:26.54,around Yau-Man. Stacy working around Lisi.
166,00:10:33.38,00:10:33.38,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Both going in.
167,00:10:36.08,00:10:36.08,Michelle working Rita now. Stacy and Lisi are trying to get
168,00:10:40.25,00:10:40.25,back up. Big reward on the line.
169,00:10:44.92,00:10:44.92,Stacy tries a new approach. And that knocks Lisi off.
170,00:10:50.17,00:10:50.17,There's a learning curve to this challenge.
171,00:10:52.29,00:10:52.29,You will figure it out as you go along.
172,00:10:55.17,00:10:55.17,Michelle making good progress. She's halfway through.
173,00:10:58.83,00:10:58.83,Dreamz has a new idea. Your hands cannot touch the
174,00:11:03.71,00:11:03.71,beam. Lisi steps over Stacy.
175,00:11:08.54,00:11:08.54,Michelle hugging her way past Rocky.
176,00:11:11.92,00:11:11.92,Lisi stepping over Alex. Both going in.
177,00:11:15.83,00:11:15.83,"Michelle easily sidesteps around Earl, the first tribe member"
178,00:11:19.17,00:11:19.17,"across for Ravu. >> Lisi, let's go, baby, both of"
179,00:11:22.54,00:11:22.54,your hands on Alex. >> PROBST: Moto going to stick
180,00:11:26.33,00:11:26.33,with their strategy. Yau-Man now working around Rita.
181,00:11:30.12,00:11:30.12,"Gingerly, but it's effective. Lisi now going to have to"
182,00:11:34.33,00:11:34.33,"sidestep a much taller guy, and she can't do it."
183,00:11:37.17,00:11:37.17,Lisi back to the start. Yau-Man crosses for Ravu.
184,00:11:48.08,00:11:48.08,Ravu leads 2-0. Moto has a very precise strategy
185,00:11:52.21,00:11:52.21,"they're trying to work out. No, Lisi, you can't touch two"
186,00:11:55.17,00:11:55.17,"people. One at a time, one at a time."
187,00:12:00.25,00:12:00.25,Rita now working for Ravu. >> You can do it!
188,00:12:04.29,00:12:04.29,You can do it! >> PROBST: Lisi still trying to

190,00:12:12.21,00:12:12.21,Rita and Anthony still working it.
191,00:12:19.62,00:12:19.62,>> Use your hands and put your weight on him but make sure it's

193,00:12:25.46,00:12:25.46,to get over. Lisi across for Moto.
194,00:12:30.12,00:12:30.12,It's two-one. Anthony and Rita have been
195,00:12:34.25,00:12:34.25,locked in an embrace for a long time.
196,00:12:37.33,00:12:37.33,"Anthony falls off, a lot of progress lost for Ravu."
197,00:12:41.29,00:12:41.29,Moto's strategy is starting to work.
198,00:12:45.75,00:12:45.75,Alex over Boo. Moto has tied at two-two.
199,00:12:48.92,00:12:48.92,">> Come on, come on! >> PROBST: Mookie and Anthony,"
200,00:12:51.08,00:12:51.08,going to have to work together. Mookie and Anthony both fall in.
201,00:13:01.58,00:13:01.58,Stacy trying to figure out how she's going to get over Edgardo.
202,00:13:09.25,00:13:09.25,Edgardo jumps in. All kinds of strategy coming
203,00:13:11.08,00:13:11.08,into play. >> Everyone fall in.
204,00:13:14.17,00:13:14.17,"Everyone fall in! Earl, stay."
205,00:13:16.04,00:13:16.04,"Come on, come on! >> PROBST: Ravu changing their"
206,00:13:17.96,00:13:17.96,entire lineup. Half the tribe jumps in to give
207,00:13:20.21,00:13:20.21,the stronger people a better shot.
208,00:13:23.00,00:13:23.00,But Anthony can't even stay up on the beam.
209,00:13:25.21,00:13:25.21,>> ( groaning ) >> ( cheers )
210,00:13:31.46,00:13:31.46,>> PROBST: Edgardo scores for Moto.
211,00:13:33.25,00:13:33.25,"We are three-two, Moto now in the lead."

213,00:13:39.62,00:13:39.62,at a time. Think.
214,00:13:42.08,00:13:42.08,Get in the water. Liliana making it look easy.
215,00:13:49.25,00:13:49.25,Moto leads four-two. Ravu still working.
216,00:13:53.33,00:13:53.33,Dreamz is across. It is five-two.
217,00:14:01.21,00:14:01.21,Stacy across for Moto. Boo gives a wave to the crowd.
218,00:14:07.67,00:14:07.67,"Moto wins reward! Ravu, once again, early lead,"
219,00:14:19.08,00:14:19.08,"lost it in the end. Moto, still undefeated in"
220,00:14:22.12,00:14:22.12,"challenges, and a big decision to make."
221,00:14:25.33,00:14:25.33,Sending one person to Exile Island.

223,00:14:30.29,00:14:30.29,Who's it going to be? >> Yau-Man.

227,00:14:47.96,00:14:47.96,"waiting back at camp, a king- sized bed."
228,00:14:49.92,00:14:49.92,"Congratulations. Ravu, once again, got nothing"
229,00:14:52.12,00:14:52.12,for you. Head back to camp.
230,00:15:18.21,00:15:18.21,>> Yeah! >> This is great!
231,00:15:23.08,00:15:23.08,>> Look at the size of this fish!
232,00:15:29.12,00:15:29.12,">> Today we once again kicked the crap out of Ravu, and in the"
233,00:15:33.54,00:15:33.54,"process, won ourselves a bed, which I am so excited about."
234,00:15:39.42,00:15:39.42,">> Oh, my god. >> We can fit five people in"
235,00:15:42.08,00:15:42.08,"here, man. >> Not only to we have comfort"
236,00:15:44.12,00:15:44.12,"with the cushions and the blankets, but the fish that we"
237,00:15:48.04,00:15:48.04,"got, and the seasoning, I was like, ""Oh, my gosh, I'm in"
238,00:15:51.17,00:15:51.17,"heaven."" >> Here, pull these spices off."
239,00:15:53.21,00:15:53.21,">> Man, soy sauce! >> Paprika."
240,00:15:56.04,00:15:56.04,">> I know. >> Okay, what you all got?"
241,00:15:58.21,00:15:58.21,>> Oregano. >> We're just living lovely
242,00:15:59.92,00:15:59.92,right now. Our morale is up now more than
243,00:16:01.67,00:16:01.67,"ever. >> Geez, man, we're going to eat"
244,00:16:03.88,00:16:03.88,"like kings today. >> Oh, man!"
245,00:16:05.96,00:16:05.96,>> Motolicious. >> I feel sorry for the
246,00:16:10.62,00:16:10.62,"individual members of the other tribe, but I want us to continue"
247,00:16:13.00,00:16:13.00,winning. I... I don't want to let up for
248,00:16:15.21,00:16:15.21,a second. >> Absolutely ridiculous!
249,00:16:32.21,00:16:32.21,Five in a row? Five in a row we lose?
250,00:16:35.75,00:16:35.75,>> What do you want to do? Do you want to get together and
251,00:16:37.92,00:16:37.92,"talk about it, or... >> Thank you!"
252,00:16:41.12,00:16:41.12,Why don't we just go to tribal council right now?
253,00:16:44.75,00:16:44.75,"You want to go to tribal council right now, we'll vote somebody"
254,00:16:46.62,00:16:46.62,off? Because that's all we do every
255,00:16:48.50,00:16:48.50,week. Every other day we vote somebody
256,00:16:50.54,00:16:50.54,off. So why don't we call Jeff up
257,00:16:53.00,00:16:53.00,"right now on the Jeff phone and go, ""Hey, Jeff, we're ready to"
258,00:16:55.38,00:16:55.38,"vote somebody off today."" I'm skinnier than homeless"
259,00:16:59.62,00:16:59.62,people right now. I know 15 homeless people that
260,00:17:02.29,00:17:02.29,are 40 pounds heavier than me. Are you serious?
261,00:17:05.00,00:17:05.00,They're getting more nutrition in their diet.
262,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,That's it right there. That was it.
263,00:17:09.33,00:17:09.33,"Food, pillows, a bed. Everything we complain about"
264,00:17:12.92,00:17:12.92,every day and we couldn't muster it up.
265,00:17:15.58,00:17:15.58,Tell me why. >> We just lost.
266,00:17:19.04,00:17:19.04,">> So what's the sense? What's the sense of going, ""Oh,"
267,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17,"we'll get them next time, oh, we'll do this next time""?"
268,00:17:24.12,00:17:24.12,No. I'm not sugarcoating nothing.
269,00:17:26.08,00:17:26.08,">> We lost, it sucks, let's move on."
270,00:17:28.04,00:17:28.04,"I mean, if you go in somewhere thinking you're going to lose,"
271,00:17:29.83,00:17:29.83,your chances are... >> I'm not being negative.
272,00:17:31.67,00:17:31.67,I'm stating the obvious. There's a difference.
273,00:17:33.54,00:17:33.54,There's a difference. >> Who's going to get more wood?
274,00:17:36.54,00:17:36.54,>> I like Rocky's spirit but it's not all about just talk.
275,00:17:40.17,00:17:40.17,"It's about motivating. Like, do something-- not just at"
276,00:17:42.17,00:17:42.17,challenges but here on this island.
277,00:17:44.96,00:17:44.96,>> Argh! >> I'm starving!
278,00:17:53.67,00:17:53.67,">> We have an interesting tribe. >> I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm"
279,00:17:57.04,00:17:57.04,"thirsty, but do I still get my ass up and go do something?"
280,00:18:00.42,00:18:00.42,"Yeah. But I'm telling you now, I can"
281,00:18:02.88,00:18:02.88,already feel this one. >> I already know how it's going
282,00:18:05.12,00:18:05.12,"to go. If we lose tomorrow, you know"
283,00:18:07.12,00:18:07.12,whose name's going down? It's going to be me.
284,00:18:09.38,00:18:09.38,"I know I have a big target on me, and I know that I have to be"
285,00:18:12.50,00:18:12.50,careful and patient. But now that I've gotten a
286,00:18:15.42,00:18:15.42,"better grasp on who James is, I'll let him keep talking,"
287,00:18:18.58,00:18:18.58,because really in the end it makes him look like an ass.
288,00:18:22.00,00:18:22.00,"If you don't like your bed, fix it."
289,00:18:24.75,00:18:24.75,Chop down some palm fronds. I trust Anthony.
290,00:18:29.04,00:18:29.04,"I think he's a good guy, he's a genuine guy."
291,00:18:31.46,00:18:31.46,But it's getting harder to look out for him.
292,00:18:34.67,00:18:34.67,But I haven't made my exact move yet of what I'm going to do.
293,00:18:37.21,00:18:37.21,"I'm still devising the plan. >> ""Here you won't find the idol"
294,00:18:52.08,00:18:52.08,you crave. It's buried under the highest
295,00:18:54.92,00:18:54.92,"point of the big cave."" I'm not resentful at all of Moto"
296,00:19:01.21,00:19:01.21,"for sending me here. In a way, I'm glad I get a"
297,00:19:04.04,00:19:04.04,chance to find the immunity idol.
298,00:19:07.12,00:19:07.12,Highest point through which you enter.
299,00:19:09.21,00:19:09.21,So it must be at the entrance. We may be sleeping on it.
300,00:19:12.00,00:19:12.00,I'm quite sure I know where the idol is.
301,00:19:14.17,00:19:14.17,"The problem, of course, is when do I get the chance to dig"
302,00:19:17.38,00:19:17.38,alone? I need the immunity idol very
303,00:19:19.79,00:19:19.79,"badly, so I'll see how fast I can dig."
304,00:19:48.88,00:19:48.88,">> Whoa, whoa, whoa! ( laughter )"
305,00:19:53.12,00:19:53.12,">> Liliana knows what she's doing, and sometimes guys aren't"
306,00:19:56.71,00:19:56.71,"hip to the way chicks maneuver. It's funny, because Liliana"
307,00:20:00.38,00:20:00.38,"tries to be so sneaky, but I'm Latin, and knowing my people the"
308,00:20:03.42,00:20:03.42,"way that I do, I see what she's doing."
309,00:20:06.08,00:20:06.08,I know in her little diabolical Mexican mind she's trying to
310,00:20:09.33,00:20:09.33,"come up with something, you know?"
311,00:20:12.12,00:20:12.12,">> Oh, my god! ( laughter )"
312,00:20:16.08,00:20:16.08,>> Wow! What in the world?
313,00:20:38.04,00:20:38.04,>> It just seems like the whole world is caving in here.
314,00:20:40.04,00:20:40.04,I don't got the energy to do nothing.
315,00:20:41.75,00:20:41.75,I just can't... I can't function.
316,00:20:45.46,00:20:45.46,">> How you doing, big guy? Feeling nauseated?"
317,00:20:49.08,00:20:49.08,>> I ain't never had nothing like this before.
318,00:20:51.33,00:20:51.33,"I've had malaria ages ago, and that's nothing compared to"
319,00:20:54.83,00:20:54.83,what's going on. It just kind of scares you a
320,00:20:57.21,00:20:57.21,"little bit, you know? I just don't have..."
321,00:21:06.21,00:21:06.21,">> Hi, Gary. >> I'm very worried for Papa"
322,00:21:25.42,00:21:25.42,"Smurf, because I can see Papa Smurf was real hurt."
323,00:21:27.67,00:21:27.67,"Papa Smurf is one of the only people I talk to, so that's kind"
324,00:21:29.96,00:21:29.96,of worrying me. >> All right.
325,00:22:02.21,00:22:02.21,>> I'm not so concerned about whether Gary stays in the game
326,00:22:04.88,00:22:04.88,"or not. Quite frankly, one less person,"
327,00:22:07.42,00:22:07.42,"you know, means greater odds for all of us."
328,00:22:20.04,00:22:20.04,">> Good-bye, Papa Smurf. >> Bye, Gary!"
329,00:22:22.21,00:22:22.21,">> Bye, Gary! >> Today was very frustrating,"
330,00:22:24.75,00:22:24.75,"to be honest with you. We lost Gary, and... I don't"
331,00:22:27.79,00:22:27.79,know. I feel... I don't feel good
332,00:22:30.50,00:22:30.50,about it. I don't feel good about today at
333,00:22:32.54,00:22:32.54,"all. >> Bye, Papa Smurf!"
334,00:22:34.50,00:22:34.50,">> Bye, Papa Smurf! >> Love you!"
335,00:22:36.92,00:22:36.92,>> I hope to god we don't lose the next immunity challenge
336,00:22:39.08,00:22:39.08,tomorrow. But if we lose that immunity
337,00:22:41.12,00:22:41.12,"challenge, we're 7-7. In the eyes of the game, we're"
338,00:22:43.96,00:22:43.96,"tied, and then we're screwed. >> I'm going crazy, bro."
339,00:23:05.12,00:23:05.12,"I'm going crazy, bro. I just want to start winning."
340,00:23:08.83,00:23:08.83,But all I can do is the best I can and try to get people fired
341,00:23:10.96,00:23:10.96,up. I can lead by example.
342,00:23:14.25,00:23:14.25,>> We've got tree mail! >> Are you guys ready?
343,00:23:19.04,00:23:19.04,">> ""Some of you are feeling trapped while others just hang"

352,00:23:48.17,00:23:48.17,Not a pretty sight. >> Wear one of the girls'

354,00:23:54.96,00:23:54.96,>> I'm trying to make everybody laugh.
355,00:23:57.21,00:23:57.21,I'm wearing a pink halter top with some coconuts in it.
356,00:24:00.00,00:24:00.00,"Feeling pretty good right now. >> That's hilarious, man."
357,00:24:02.58,00:24:02.58,">> Anything to get the focus off losing five in a row, and"
358,00:24:04.96,00:24:04.96,hopefully just go out there and let it loose and win a game.

377,00:25:18.58,00:25:18.58,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Four tribe members
378,00:25:21.79,00:25:21.79,will begin locked in floating cages.
379,00:25:24.58,00:25:24.58,"On my ""go,"" another tribe member will head out with the key to"
380,00:25:27.67,00:25:27.67,unlock the first tribe member from a cage.
381,00:25:31.29,00:25:31.29,"Once that person is free, they must then race across a series"
382,00:25:35.08,00:25:35.08,of lily pads to free the second member from a locked cage.
383,00:25:38.25,00:25:38.25,"Once the fourth tribe member is free from their cage, that tribe"
384,00:25:41.96,00:25:41.96,member and the rescuer get onto a boat where another tribe
385,00:25:45.04,00:25:45.04,member is waiting with a ring of keys.
386,00:25:48.88,00:25:48.88,"Together, you will paddle to shore, picking up your stranded"
387,00:25:52.88,00:25:52.88,"tribemates as you go. Once you're back to shore, you"
388,00:25:55.62,00:25:55.62,must then form a human pyramid. The person on top will use the
389,00:25:59.25,00:25:59.25,ring of keys to unlock that last cage and free your final tribe
390,00:26:03.75,00:26:03.75,member. First tribe to get on their
391,00:26:07.00,00:26:07.00,finish mat wins immunity. Make sense?
392,00:26:09.08,00:26:09.08,>> Yep. >> PROBST: There is one twist to
393,00:26:11.38,00:26:11.38,today's challenge. Sealed inside this bottle is a
394,00:26:16.08,00:26:16.08,note. The winning tribe will read this
395,00:26:19.21,00:26:19.21,"note after the challenge. Moto, you're going to have to"
396,00:26:22.08,00:26:22.08,sit one person out. Cannot sit out the same people
397,00:26:24.17,00:26:24.17,in back-to-back challenges. Cassandra sat out last time.
398,00:26:26.29,00:26:26.29,Who's it going to be this time? >> We're going to sit out Lisi.
399,00:26:29.17,00:26:29.17,">> PROBST: Lisi, have a spot on the bench."
400,00:26:30.88,00:26:30.88,"Everybody else, I'll give you a minute to strategize and we'll"
401,00:26:32.67,00:26:32.67,"get started. Here we go, for immunity."
402,00:26:41.62,00:26:41.62,Survivors ready? Go!
403,00:26:47.25,00:26:47.25,Edgardo with the early lead for Moto.
404,00:26:50.50,00:26:50.50,">> Come on, Edgardo! >> Come on, Rocky."
405,00:26:52.88,00:26:52.88,"Go, Rocky. >> Edgardo to the cage first."
406,00:26:56.25,00:26:56.25,">> There you go, there you go. Rocky loses his keys, falling"
407,00:26:58.79,00:26:58.79,behind. Dreamz is out.
408,00:27:02.50,00:27:02.50,He's on the lily pads. Dreamz crawling across the lily
409,00:27:07.29,00:27:07.29,pads. Rocky has Yau-Man out.
410,00:27:10.71,00:27:10.71,">> Come on, Yau. Come on."
411,00:27:13.75,00:27:13.75,>> PROBST: Yau-Man takes on the lily pads.
412,00:27:15.83,00:27:15.83,Dreamz working on the lock trying to get Alex free.

414,00:27:23.71,00:27:23.71,"Come on, take your time. >> PROBST: Yau-Man falling"
415,00:27:26.71,00:27:26.71,behind for Ravu. Yau-Man to the platform.
416,00:27:29.33,00:27:29.33,"He's got to get up. >> Good boy, Yau!"
417,00:27:32.12,00:27:32.12,Push! >> PROBST: Moto now one full
418,00:27:34.12,00:27:34.12,"platform ahead. >> You got it, baby."
419,00:27:36.08,00:27:36.08,You got it. >> PROBST: Yau-Man losing his
420,00:27:38.46,00:27:38.46,had glasses trying to work on the lot for Rita.
421,00:27:40.88,00:27:40.88,>> Come on. >> PROBST: Alex has Boo free!
422,00:27:45.46,00:27:45.46,>> Rita now free. She's working on the lily pads.
423,00:27:50.21,00:27:50.21,Barely hanging on. Moto with a big lead now.
424,00:27:55.38,00:27:55.38,">> All right, all right, all right."
425,00:27:57.96,00:27:57.96,">> Rita, push it, push it! >> PROBST: Boo has Liliana free."
426,00:28:01.04,00:28:01.04,"They're getting on the boat. >> Go forward, forward, forward."
427,00:28:03.92,00:28:03.92,"forward. >> All right, guys paddle it!"
428,00:28:06.17,00:28:06.17,"Paddle it! >> Dig, dig, dig."
429,00:28:08.08,00:28:08.08,There you go. >> PROBST: Rita losing a lot of
430,00:28:10.67,00:28:10.67,time for Ravu. >> Get in!
431,00:28:13.12,00:28:13.12,">> Oh, my god! >> Alex on the boat for Moto."
432,00:28:18.08,00:28:18.08,>> Rita just now at the platform.
433,00:28:21.42,00:28:21.42,Ravu has a lot of time to make up.
434,00:28:24.12,00:28:24.12,">> Row, row, row, row! Ravu not quitting."
435,00:28:27.38,00:28:27.38,">> Dig, dig, dig! >> PROBST: Mookie making up a"
436,00:28:30.79,00:28:30.79,"lot of time. >> Jump in, jump in, jump in!"
437,00:28:34.21,00:28:34.21,"Dreamz now getting on the boat. >> All right, here."
438,00:28:38.04,00:28:38.04,Come on. >> Earl now free.
439,00:28:40.21,00:28:40.21,Ravu now in their boat. >> Get on!
440,00:28:43.79,00:28:43.79,Get in the middle! Get in the boat.
441,00:28:45.62,00:28:45.62,">> ( laughing ) >> Come on, Rita!"
442,00:28:48.38,00:28:48.38,">> Dig! Left side, dig."
443,00:28:50.21,00:28:50.21,">> Dig, dig, dig, dig! >> PROBST: Ravu, keep moving."
444,00:28:53.17,00:28:53.17,Let's go! Moto heading into shore.
445,00:28:56.42,00:28:56.42,>> Yeah! Yeah!
446,00:28:59.67,00:28:59.67,">> Come on, Rocky! >> PROBST: You're still in it,"
447,00:29:02.79,00:29:02.79,Ravu. Let's go!
448,00:29:04.96,00:29:04.96,>> PROBST: Moto starts to work on their human pyramid.
449,00:29:07.08,00:29:07.08,That top person has got to stand.
450,00:29:10.21,00:29:10.21,Ravu now back. Stacy working on the last lock.
451,00:29:15.04,00:29:15.04,There are five keys. Stacy having trouble with the
452,00:29:19.96,00:29:19.96,"lock, trying key after key, hoping one will fit."
453,00:29:23.25,00:29:23.25,"Ravu working on their pyramid. Ravu back in it, if Michelle"
454,00:29:27.96,00:29:27.96,picks the right key. Immunity plus a twist to be
455,00:29:32.08,00:29:32.08,revealed on the line. Stacy has to get down and open
456,00:29:39.08,00:29:39.08,the cage. Moto wins immunity!
457,00:29:49.29,00:29:49.29,"Still undefeated! Moto, congratulations once"
458,00:29:54.88,00:29:54.88,"again. >> Good job, guys!"
459,00:29:58.83,00:29:58.83,>> PROBST: Now there's one more element to this challenge-- the
460,00:30:01.25,00:30:01.25,"bottle. As I said, the winning tribe"
461,00:30:04.00,00:30:04.00,would open the bottle and read the note.
462,00:30:05.83,00:30:05.83,"Who wants it? >> ""You have just won immunity."
463,00:30:15.67,00:30:15.67,"You must now decide which is more important to you, immunity"
464,00:30:19.67,00:30:19.67,"or comfort. To keep your immunity, you must"
465,00:30:23.75,00:30:23.75,live at the Ravu tribe camp. >> Of course.
466,00:30:27.79,00:30:27.79,">> To enjoy the food and comfort of the Moto camp, you must give"
467,00:30:30.75,00:30:30.75,"up immunity and vote someone out tonight."""
468,00:30:34.96,00:30:34.96,">> PROBST: So, interesting dilemma-- which is more"
469,00:30:36.88,00:30:36.88,important? You can keep your tribe strong
470,00:30:39.04,00:30:39.04,"at eight, switch camps, go live on Ravu's beach."
471,00:30:42.75,00:30:42.75,"If comfort is more important, you can stay living where you"
472,00:30:45.04,00:30:45.04,"are. You give immunity to Ravu, you"
473,00:30:47.08,00:30:47.08,"go to tribal council and vote somebody out, and suddenly we"
474,00:30:49.92,00:30:49.92,"are even, 7-7. So all of a sudden, Gary's"
475,00:30:53.12,00:30:53.12,departure looming very large for this tribe.
476,00:30:57.21,00:30:57.21,I'll give you a minute to talk it over.
477,00:31:01.04,00:31:01.04,>> Who wants to keep the camp? Raise your hand.
478,00:31:04.04,00:31:04.04,We're going to tribal council tonight.
479,00:31:06.79,00:31:06.79,">> Jeff, we're keeping our comfort and going to tribal"
480,00:31:08.67,00:31:08.67,"council. >> PROBST: All right, Boo, go"
481,00:31:10.75,00:31:10.75,"ahead and give immunity to Ravu. Ravu, for once, you won't be"
482,00:31:17.67,00:31:17.67,"going to tribal council. Moto, you'll be going back to"
483,00:31:20.50,00:31:20.50,your camp with all the comforts. I'll see you at tribal.
484,00:31:23.21,00:31:23.21,"Grab your stuff, head on back to camp."
485,00:31:49.08,00:31:49.08,">> We won the challenge, and we had the option of giving up our"
486,00:31:52.96,00:31:52.96,"home or vote somebody off. So unfortunately, we're going to"
487,00:31:55.50,00:31:55.50,vote somebody off. And it's even uglier being that
488,00:31:59.00,00:31:59.00,"Gary left yesterday, so it's kind of like we're losing two"
489,00:32:01.42,00:32:01.42,"people. >> All right, let's sit down and"
490,00:32:03.25,00:32:03.25,talk for a second. This is what I feel is very
491,00:32:05.25,00:32:05.25,important to me. I'm going... I'm not going to
492,00:32:08.08,00:32:08.08,"sugarcoat nothing. I think we are a tribe, right?"
493,00:32:10.25,00:32:10.25,"We're honest, right? Are we snakes?"
494,00:32:13.21,00:32:13.21,Anybody here a snake? Not yet.
495,00:32:15.42,00:32:15.42,We ain't snakes yet. And let's not turn into snakes
496,00:32:17.58,00:32:17.58,yet. So with that being said and out
497,00:32:19.46,00:32:19.46,"of the way, there's two people we can afford to lose now."
498,00:32:22.25,00:32:22.25,I ain't pointing no fingers. It's Cassandra and Lisi.
499,00:32:27.25,00:32:27.25,"We can only afford to lose them, right?"
500,00:32:29.75,00:32:29.75,"Am I right? If I'm not right, if anybody"
501,00:32:31.96,00:32:31.96,objects... >> It depends on how you look
502,00:32:33.67,00:32:33.67,it. >> I think that's are the only
503,00:32:35.25,00:32:35.25,two people you can afford to lose.
504,00:32:37.04,00:32:37.04,>> I'll be sincere. I'm not going to vote for Lisi.
505,00:32:41.00,00:32:41.00,"I like Lisi. Cassandra, I'm going to be"
506,00:32:43.21,00:32:43.21,straight with you. Probably my vote tonight will be
507,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,"against you. >> Here's the thing, Dreamz."
508,00:32:47.50,00:32:47.50,I don't think you can ignore the interpersonal relationships that
509,00:32:50.12,00:32:50.12,"have been built, not because it's a friendship, but it's also"
510,00:32:52.54,00:32:52.54,"in thinking long-term, that bond may help you in the future."
511,00:32:56.50,00:32:56.50,>> We're not individuals yet. We're still a group.
512,00:32:59.08,00:32:59.08,>> Dreamz started freaking out. I think he shoots from the hip a
513,00:33:01.83,00:33:01.83,"lot, and he's a bit naive. Because he has no clue what's"
514,00:33:04.62,00:33:04.62,going on. He thinks we're all part of this
515,00:33:07.67,00:33:07.67,"solid team, that we do things together in stride."
516,00:33:10.75,00:33:10.75,"And it's not entirely untrue, it's just that the team consists"
517,00:33:14.92,00:33:14.92,"of five people-- myself, Alex, Ed, Lisi, and Boo."
518,00:33:19.88,00:33:19.88,">> If anybody else got something to say, please."
519,00:33:26.58,00:33:26.58,So is that what we're going to do?
520,00:33:32.83,00:33:32.83,">> Well we've got to decide something now before we start,"
521,00:33:34.46,00:33:34.46,"""Come with me to the water fountain real quick."
522,00:33:36.04,00:33:36.04,"Come with me to..."" you know what I'm saying?"
523,00:33:37.79,00:33:37.79,That's when we turn to snakes and start biting each other.
524,00:33:39.33,00:33:39.33,We don't have to eat each other yet.
525,00:33:41.21,00:33:41.21,We don't have to do that yet. Let's not do it yet.
526,00:33:42.92,00:33:42.92,">> I don't know, I don't know. >> I just want things to go down"
527,00:33:44.62,00:33:44.62,fair so we don't have to see the snake so early.
528,00:33:47.21,00:33:47.21,">> Uh-huh. >> Like, it's not that we don't"
529,00:34:01.17,00:34:01.17,"like you and we don't think you're a good person, because I"
530,00:34:03.42,00:34:03.42,"think you rock. >> No, I understand."
531,00:34:05.42,00:34:05.42,">> The thing is, it would be a backward step for me to go"
532,00:34:08.54,00:34:08.54,against what they're doing. I'm going to try to stay in this
533,00:34:10.79,00:34:10.79,game longer. >> Yeah.
534,00:34:12.29,00:34:12.29,"All I'll say is just, you know, hang in there."
535,00:34:14.17,00:34:14.17,It could be me going home this evening after tribal council.
536,00:34:16.46,00:34:16.46,But I don't want to be the first voted out of my tribe.
537,00:34:18.92,00:34:18.92,I didn't want to be the first voted out of the game.
538,00:34:20.79,00:34:20.79,So I'm holding on. >> I think Dreamz is better for
539,00:34:41.58,00:34:41.58,"us, so we need to keep Dreamz. >> We need to keep Dreamz, okay?"
540,00:34:47.25,00:34:47.25,">> I vote Liliana, too. >> Let's do it."
541,00:34:52.04,00:34:52.04,"She's going to be like... As far as I'm concerned, Liliana"
542,00:34:56.04,00:34:56.04,is the weakest link. Because our biggest concern is
543,00:34:59.00,00:34:59.00,"to get to the top five, and she's the one person that could"
544,00:35:01.04,00:35:01.04,threaten it. She could try to manipulate
545,00:35:03.17,00:35:03.17,things. She could say all sorts of
546,00:35:05.46,00:35:05.46,things that could start tearing us apart.
547,00:35:07.62,00:35:07.62,>> If we take out Liliana... Cassandra is bad at everything.
548,00:35:10.54,00:35:10.54,She sucks at everything. >> It's not... we're not going
549,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,to be hurting. I swear to you.
550,00:35:17.00,00:35:17.00,">> The most logical thing is to keep Liliana, vote out Cassandra"
551,00:35:20.04,00:35:20.04,until we have a numbers advantage again.
552,00:35:22.79,00:35:22.79,Right now we're 7-7. Why on god's green earth would
553,00:35:25.83,00:35:25.83,"you vote out a woman who is as strong, almost as any of the"
554,00:35:28.46,00:35:28.46,men? That to me seems absurd.
555,00:35:30.71,00:35:30.71,>> One of them has got to go. >> I'm voting Liliana.
556,00:35:33.71,00:35:33.71,">> Me, too. >> I'm very frustrated."
557,00:35:35.62,00:35:35.62,I feel like this is illogical. I want to do what's best for our
558,00:35:37.62,00:35:37.62,five-person alliance and for the team in general.
559,00:35:40.46,00:35:40.46,Liliana is a good person. She's worked hard at these
560,00:35:44.21,00:35:44.21,challenges. She deserves to stay.
561,00:35:46.33,00:35:46.33,Cassandra should go. >> PROBST: Behind each of you is
562,00:36:03.62,00:36:03.62,a torch. Go ahead and grab a torch and
563,00:36:05.54,00:36:05.54,"approach the flame. Dip it in, get fire."
564,00:36:10.50,00:36:10.50,"This is part of the ritual of tribal council, because in this"
565,00:36:14.08,00:36:14.08,"game, fire represents life. As long as you have fire, you're"
566,00:36:17.33,00:36:17.33,"still in the game. When your fire is gone, so are"
567,00:36:19.62,00:36:19.62,"you. Boo, tell me about the loss of"
568,00:36:22.96,00:36:22.96,Gary. What was the reaction when he
569,00:36:25.25,00:36:25.25,"had to leave? >> Everyone, even the other"
570,00:36:28.71,00:36:28.71,"tribe, loved Gary. He was sick for three days, and"
571,00:36:32.38,00:36:32.38,"he stayed tough for our tribe. We miss him, and we can't wait"
572,00:36:36.92,00:36:36.92,"to see him again. >> PROBST: Dreamz, let's talk"
573,00:36:39.29,00:36:39.29,about friendship. Are you starting to bond with
574,00:36:41.71,00:36:41.71,certain people maybe more than others?
575,00:36:44.04,00:36:44.04,>> Pretty much Papa Smurf and Cassandra.
576,00:36:46.17,00:36:46.17,"But I'm not going to lie to you. The rest of them, if I talk they"
577,00:36:48.17,00:36:48.17,just get silent or they don't talk back.
578,00:36:51.71,00:36:51.71,">> PROBST: Edgardo, can you understand what Dreamz is"
579,00:36:53.96,00:36:53.96,saying? >> I really don't know where
580,00:36:56.38,00:36:56.38,"he's coming from. I think we all, you know, treat"
581,00:36:58.29,00:36:58.29,"each other the same way. You know, I treat Liliana the"
582,00:37:00.83,00:37:00.83,"same way I treat Dreamz or Boo. But if he feels that way, I'm"
583,00:37:03.46,00:37:03.46,going to make sure he doesn't feel that way anymore.
584,00:37:06.21,00:37:06.21,>> PROBST: Let's talk about today's challenge.
585,00:37:08.88,00:37:08.88,"Lisi, in spite of the fact that you won, you have to come to"
586,00:37:11.92,00:37:11.92,tribal council. So what happens at camp?
587,00:37:14.46,00:37:14.46,">> As a matter of fact, Dreamz goes on a soliloquy about how,"
588,00:37:18.12,00:37:18.12,"you know, some people should be voted off, the weakest ones..."
589,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,>> Jeff... >> Cassandra and Lisi.
590,00:37:24.12,00:37:24.12,"So he's talking about being indivisible, but he's pointing"
591,00:37:26.12,00:37:26.12,fingers. Hello!
592,00:37:28.83,00:37:28.83,">> PROBST: So, Dreamz, you come back to camp and you decide,"
593,00:37:31.75,00:37:31.75,"""Let's just have a powwow and I'm going tell you how it is."""
594,00:37:34.29,00:37:34.29,">> Well, not like that, Jeff. Don't make me sound like a"
595,00:37:37.12,00:37:37.12,monster. >> PROBST: I'm asking!
596,00:37:39.62,00:37:39.62,">> All right. I was just saying, ""Stop me if"
597,00:37:41.62,00:37:41.62,"I'm wrong, if y'all think I'm wrong at any point in time."""
598,00:37:43.54,00:37:43.54,"Nobody stopped me, Jeff. They let me go on a shaquila, or"
599,00:37:47.83,00:37:47.83,whatever she called it. >> PROBST: Soliloquy.
600,00:37:50.38,00:37:50.38,">> She let me go on a soliloquy, or whatever they call it."
601,00:37:52.96,00:37:52.96,"I didn't want to eat each other yet, you know what I'm saying?"
602,00:37:55.12,00:37:55.12,I didn't want people to go off into little groups and start
603,00:37:57.12,00:37:57.12,"talking about people. >> PROBST: So Alex, you didn't"
604,00:37:59.92,00:37:59.92,"lose, but you're here. You don't want to vote somebody"
605,00:38:02.21,00:38:02.21,"out, but you have to. What do you base it on?"
606,00:38:04.33,00:38:04.33,>> I think you base it on what's going to be best for the tribe
607,00:38:07.08,00:38:07.08,"moving forward, and we're going to just move on and do whatever"
608,00:38:10.58,00:38:10.58,it takes to make sure that Ravu doesn't have another opportunity
609,00:38:12.83,00:38:12.83,to have one of our members voted out.
610,00:38:15.00,00:38:15.00,">> PROBST: Liliana, what do you bring to this tribe?"
611,00:38:17.58,00:38:17.58,">> I feel that I bring strength, and I try to get with the guys"
612,00:38:22.88,00:38:22.88,"and say, ""Let's go fishing or hunting or climbing."""
613,00:38:26.04,00:38:26.04,So helping the guys out is not a problem for me.
614,00:38:28.38,00:38:28.38,"That's just the way I am at home, and I'm here being the"
615,00:38:31.38,00:38:31.38,same person. >> PROBST: Cassandra.
616,00:38:34.29,00:38:34.29,>> I definitely want to compliment Liliana.
617,00:38:36.38,00:38:36.38,She's exemplary for the female strength.
618,00:38:39.08,00:38:39.08,She's just amazing. I just look for her to go very
619,00:38:40.96,00:38:40.96,far in the game. Love you.
620,00:38:43.71,00:38:43.71,">> Love you, too. >> PROBST: All right, it is time"
621,00:38:46.88,00:38:46.88,"to vote. Alex, you're up."
622,00:39:03.29,00:39:03.29,>> I'm going to really miss you. You're such a great person.
623,00:39:05.71,00:39:05.71,I really did see the strength in you.
624,00:39:21.54,00:39:21.54,">> The alliance is five, not six."
625,00:39:46.17,00:39:46.17,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
626,00:40:00.33,00:40:00.33,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
627,00:40:03.33,00:40:03.33,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
628,00:40:05.38,00:40:05.38,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
629,00:40:09.08,00:40:09.08,"First vote, Liliana. Lisi."
630,00:40:17.21,00:40:17.21,"One vote Liliana, one vote Lisi. Cassandra."
631,00:40:24.46,00:40:24.46,"That's one vote each for Liliana, Lisi, and Cassandra."
632,00:40:30.42,00:40:30.42,Liliana. Two votes Liliana.
633,00:40:37.96,00:40:37.96,"Liliana. That's three votes Liliana, one"
634,00:40:40.83,00:40:40.83,"vote Lisi, one vote Cassandra. Fourth person voted out of"
635,00:40:47.83,00:40:47.83,"Survivor: Fiji, Liliana. >> Wow."
636,00:40:52.12,00:40:52.12,>> PROBST: That's four. That's enough.
637,00:40:53.92,00:40:53.92,You need to bring me your torch. >> I'm so shocked.
638,00:40:57.12,00:40:57.12,"So shocked. If they didn't get me out now, I"
639,00:41:04.88,00:41:04.88,"was going to beat them. >> PROBST: Liliana, the tribe"
640,00:41:07.04,00:41:07.04,"has spoken. >> PROBST: Well, I think"
641,00:41:27.21,00:41:27.21,Liliana's expression said it all.
642,00:41:29.29,00:41:29.29,This game definitely being played within the Moto tribe.
643,00:41:32.12,00:41:32.12,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
644,00:41:34.08,00:41:34.08,Good night. >> PROBST: stay tuned for scenes
645,00:41:50.17,00:41:50.17,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
646,00:41:56.12,00:41:56.12,Survivor: >> Those two are two sour
647,00:41:58.04,00:41:58.04,apples. >> PROBST: Moto begins to
648,00:41:59.54,00:41:59.54,fracture. >> PROBST: The hunt for the idol
649,00:42:04.21,00:42:04.21,is on. >> I got a chance to dig.
650,00:42:06.21,00:42:06.21,I don't know for how long. >> Laugh it up.
651,00:42:08.62,00:42:08.62,>> Why don't me and you go up there right now?
652,00:42:10.08,00:42:10.08,>> We could. >> Let's do that then.
653,00:42:11.83,00:42:11.83,Keep running your mouth. Bring it.
654,00:42:13.12,00:42:13.12,>> PROBST: And the gloves come off.
655,00:42:19.25,00:42:19.25,">> Well, I'm definitely 100% shocked."
656,00:42:23.96,00:42:23.96,"To me, it's ridiculous to get rid of one of your stronger"
657,00:42:26.08,00:42:26.08,people in the beginning. I just wish I could have stayed
658,00:42:28.42,00:42:28.42,"in longer, because I definitely would have kicked some butt."
659,00:42:31.12,00:42:31.12,"Wow, there are some good liars, great liars."
660,00:42:34.83,00:42:34.83,I think the weak link stayed behind and not... the strong
661,00:42:36.83,00:42:36.83,one's leaving today.
