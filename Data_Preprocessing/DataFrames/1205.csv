324,00:18:05.62,00:18:05.62,">> Well, I got to go again.>> I got to go right now, dude."
325,00:18:11.71,00:18:11.71,(thunder crashes)>> Yeah.

331,00:19:28.58,00:19:28.58,"Luckily, last night, therained stopped, so the lake"
332,00:19:31.88,00:19:31.88,didn't go into our shelter.And I don't know what happened
333,00:19:35.12,00:19:35.12,to Bruce and Bobby.Apparently they slept in the
334,00:19:38.00,00:19:38.00,bathroom or something.I can't wait to hear that story.
335,00:19:43.38,00:19:43.38,">> I didn't see it.If they did that, that is so"
336,00:19:45.71,00:19:45.71,wrong.Like seriously... that's so not
337,00:19:49.17,00:19:49.17,right.(laughs)

340,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,"folded in half, and there at hisfeet-- hmm?-- the empty bottle"
341,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,of wine.>> I just threw it away.
342,00:20:19.04,00:20:19.04,>> I would have to be dead andsomeone would have to pour it
343,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,down my throat for me to drinkthe last bottle of wine that we
344,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,as a tribe won.>> What happened to that last

354,00:20:58.21,00:20:58.21,It was really bad judgment ofBobby to open the bottle of
355,00:21:01.67,00:21:01.67,wine and drink it.We all worked really hard for
356,00:21:04.04,00:21:04.04,that.Wine out here is like super
357,00:21:06.25,00:21:06.25,special.Now none of us really trust
358,00:21:08.71,00:21:08.71,Bobby.We were all supposed to
359,00:21:10.12,00:21:10.12,celebrate and drink that winetogether.
360,00:21:11.38,00:21:11.38,">> Right, and I brought it inthere, we were supposed to drink"
361,00:21:13.96,00:21:13.96,"it last night...>> Yeah, but why would you ever"
362,00:21:15.79,00:21:15.79,"do that on your own?>> 'Cause, you guys..."

364,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,>> You did.>> I didn't think I did.
365,00:21:20.42,00:21:20.42,"Maybe I did, but when I calledout..."
366,00:21:22.08,00:21:22.08,">> You really made a bad, badcall."
367,00:21:23.75,00:21:23.75,>> I don't feel bad that Istole your wine.
368,00:21:25.58,00:21:25.58,"Like I feel bad that I deprivedthem of wine, but I have no hard"
369,00:21:28.67,00:21:28.67,feelings whatsoever about thefact that you've been deprived
370,00:21:31.33,00:21:31.33,of wine.Courtney definitely had a right
371,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,to be upset.I just don't need to hear it.
372,00:21:38.21,00:21:38.21,I really don't care what shethinks.
373,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,She's probably one of the twoor three most annoying people
374,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,probably in the history of theworld.
375,00:21:43.29,00:21:43.29,>> It's so over.I don't have the energy for

567,00:33:13.04,00:33:13.04,"I don't.Courtney, why don't we switch"
568,00:33:15.42,00:33:15.42,this game up right now andvote...

573,00:33:24.25,00:33:24.25,>> I'm scared of that.I don't like that.
574,00:33:26.04,00:33:26.04,"Aras is putting himself, settinghimself up."
575,00:33:28.08,00:33:28.08,>> Aras is setting himself up sohard-core...

578,00:33:34.04,00:33:34.04,"me, you-- us four vote forBobby."
579,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,Aras wanted Bruce gone.I just-- I didn't feel
580,00:33:41.17,00:33:41.17,comfortable with that.I wanted Bruce to stay and I
581,00:33:44.79,00:33:44.79,"wanted Bobby to go, so I tookcontrol and I said this is not"
582,00:33:47.62,00:33:47.62,what I want.Keep Bruce.
583,00:33:50.71,00:33:50.71,I'm telling you it's a betterdecision for all of us.
584,00:33:54.83,00:33:54.83,It's less risky.>> Bobby's not going to flop.
585,00:33:57.33,00:33:57.33,>> I just don't trust him.>> I don't trust him either.
586,00:33:59.46,00:33:59.46,">> Okay, here's the deal.I can't vote him off."
587,00:34:01.50,00:34:01.50,I swore on my kid that he wasthe sixth.
588,00:34:03.71,00:34:03.71,I can't.>> Of course he's going to swear
589,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,on your kid.Why wouldn't he?
590,00:34:08.04,00:34:08.04,He knows he's getting voted off.He's going to say anything.
591,00:34:10.88,00:34:10.88,>> That's-- here's the deal.>> Bruce would stay with us more
592,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,than Bobby would.>> I agree.
593,00:34:14.71,00:34:14.71,">> Well, why didn't you tell methat an hour ago, Courtney?"
594,00:34:18.17,00:34:18.17,You said an hour ago...>> Don't yell at me.
595,00:34:20.33,00:34:20.33,">> I'm just yelling in general.And stop with the ""don't yell at"
596,00:34:24.00,00:34:24.00,"me.""I'm just-- we're talking."
597,00:34:25.88,00:34:25.88,You wouldn't listen to me when Iwas telling you all this stuff
598,00:34:28.08,00:34:28.08,"about Bobby.>> Well, you were right."
599,00:34:29.12,00:34:29.12,>> I don't want Bobby making itto the merge.
600,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,>> You were right.>> You were right.
601,00:34:32.29,00:34:32.29,">> You were right.>> You were right, you were"
602,00:34:34.08,00:34:34.08,right.>> You were right and now you've
603,00:34:37.83,00:34:37.83,been talked to and changed yourmind.
604,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,You were right from thebeginning.
605,00:34:41.54,00:34:41.54,">> I mean, honestly.>> Everyone's out of their mind."
606,00:34:44.12,00:34:44.12,There's nothing I can do.I told everybody initially that
607,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,Bobby should go and then theyall freaked out and said
608,00:34:49.50,00:34:49.50,"nothing.They're like women, you know"
609,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,"what I mean, and now they'regoing back to Bobby."
610,00:34:54.00,00:34:54.00,"So it's like, you know, whoknows?"
611,00:35:11.17,00:35:11.17,>> PROBST: Everybody has a torchexcept Bruce.
612,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,There's one on the end.Go ahead and grab it.
613,00:35:16.38,00:35:16.38,"Approach a flame and get fire.Fire's gone, so are you."
614,00:35:27.79,00:35:27.79,"Shane, last time you guys werehere, I kind of felt as though"
615,00:35:31.71,00:35:31.71,this was a tribe that was in abit of disarray.
616,00:35:34.62,00:35:34.62,Has that changed?>> I would say that we are the
617,00:35:37.04,00:35:37.04,dysfunctional functional tribe.I think when it comes to
618,00:35:40.75,00:35:40.75,"challenges, we step up and weknow how to work together, but"
619,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,"this tribe can be really, reallytiring."
620,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,>> PROBST: Let's talk aboutwhat's going on at camp life.
621,00:35:48.58,00:35:48.58,You've had some heavy downpours.How's the shelter holding up?
622,00:35:52.04,00:35:52.04,>> I ended up sleeping in theouthouse that night.
623,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,">> PROBST: In the rain?>> Yeah, in the outhouse."
624,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,>> With the bottle of wine.>> I went in there just kind of
625,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,trying to get comfortable forabout an hour and all of a
626,00:36:01.46,00:36:01.46,"sudden I hear a knock on thedoor, and Bobby shows up with a"
627,00:36:04.42,00:36:04.42,"bottle of wine-- and at 2:00,3:00 in the morning in the"
628,00:36:07.04,00:36:07.04,"freezing rain with my buttsore-- and I said ""I could use a"
629,00:36:10.29,00:36:10.29,"drink."">> PROBST: Did anyone know,"
630,00:36:12.21,00:36:12.21,"Bobby, that you took the bottleof wine?"
631,00:36:13.92,00:36:13.92,"Was that okay with them?>> No, they didn't know and I"
632,00:36:16.38,00:36:16.38,found out later that it wasn'tokay.
633,00:36:18.42,00:36:18.42,But the reason why Bruce and Iended up in the outhouse is that
634,00:36:21.00,00:36:21.00,the spots that we had reservedwere taken and I was left to
635,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"sleep exposed to the rain.So I was like, ""All right, well,"
636,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,now I got this bottle of wineand everybody I was supposed to
637,00:36:28.04,00:36:28.04,"share it with is asleep and myspot's been taken, so, all"
638,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,"right, let me go over here andget my drink on with my boy"
639,00:36:32.42,00:36:32.42,"Bruce."">> PROBST: I've got to say if"
640,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"I'm the other five people, I'mlooking at you and Bruce and"
641,00:36:37.62,00:36:37.62,"thinking, ""You guys don't wantto be a part of this tribe?"
642,00:36:40.08,00:36:40.08,"Tribal Council is easy."">> Oh, I agree."
643,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,It was very-- I gave them plentyof ammunition.
644,00:36:44.79,00:36:44.79,"You know?I didn't think it was wrong, but"
645,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,I understood people could bedisappointed.
646,00:36:47.58,00:36:47.58,"What I apologized for wasn't theact, but it was for the way it"
647,00:36:50.21,00:36:50.21,made people feel if it madepeople feel a certain way.
648,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,">> PROBST: Cirie, did Bobby makea mistake?"
649,00:36:55.88,00:36:55.88,What did Bobby do from yourpoint of view?
650,00:36:59.12,00:36:59.12,">> I think it was a huge, hugemistake only because we all as a"
651,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,"group fought for the rewardchallenge, and the reasoning"
652,00:37:09.96,00:37:09.96,that he's coming up with justdoesn't sound good to me.
653,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,>> But I also feel like we'reall getting on Bob.
654,00:37:16.25,00:37:16.25,Bruce knew very well as wellthat there was three other
655,00:37:19.29,00:37:19.29,people that wanted that wine.>> I'm just as guilty and I
656,00:37:22.29,00:37:22.29,"apologize to the group now, buteven then nobody came up to me"
657,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,"and said, ""Bruce, you ass, youdrank that."""
658,00:37:28.42,00:37:28.42,"I'm just going with the group,and if they made it clear it was"
659,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,"just horribly wrong, you couldhave talked to me."
660,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,">> But, Bruce, the onus is noton them to ask for you to"
661,00:37:38.08,00:37:38.08,explain yourself.I think that you're responsible
662,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,"to go up to the people in thegroup and to say, ""Look, I made"
663,00:37:43.25,00:37:43.25,"a selfish decision and Iapologize."""
664,00:37:45.25,00:37:45.25,"I mean, to Bob's credit, helived up to it, said, ""Yo, I did"
665,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"this,"" but to just kind ofpretend like it didn't happen,"
666,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,to shuck it off yourshoulders...

668,00:37:53.42,00:37:53.42,There was so much that we had todo.
669,00:37:55.29,00:37:55.29,"That probably was the furthestthing from my mind, honestly."
670,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,">> PROBST: Bruce, do you feelunappreciated?"
671,00:38:01.12,00:38:01.12,">> Oh, yeah, at times, becausethey ask for my suggestion, then"
672,00:38:04.71,00:38:04.71,they challenge it.I've never been challenged more
673,00:38:08.04,00:38:08.04,times in my life on advice thatwas asked for me in over a whole
674,00:38:11.88,00:38:11.88,year combined with thousands ofstudents.
675,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,"It's unbelievable.>> But Bruce, we are not your"

677,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,"tribesmen, and so when you doget challenged, you can't look"
678,00:38:20.04,00:38:20.04,"at it as some sort of ego blow,but, no, this is a tribe"
679,00:38:22.46,00:38:22.46,learning to work together.>> You're completely wrong
680,00:38:24.00,00:38:24.00,there.I don't think that.
681,00:38:24.92,00:38:24.92,I was just throwing that out.>> I just think he just feels
