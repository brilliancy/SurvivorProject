4,00:00:07.29,00:00:07.29,"the men's alliance, and Sally knew she was in trouble."
5,00:00:11.88,00:00:11.88,>> All I can do right now is keep working hard and prove
6,00:00:14.62,00:00:14.62,myself valuable. >> PROBST: At the Reward

15,00:00:33.46,00:00:33.46,banished to Exile Island. When Casaya returned to camp...

17,00:00:40.29,00:00:40.29,conflict over how to use their reward.
18,00:00:42.12,00:00:42.12,">> My vote is to use the bathroom for firewood, just"
19,00:00:44.08,00:00:44.08,keeping things dry. >> Anyone mind if I break in
20,00:00:46.42,00:00:46.42,the Dumpster? >> Use the bathroom to keep the
21,00:00:48.54,00:00:48.54,wood dry. Bobby just frustrates me.
22,00:00:51.17,00:00:51.17,I can't stand the fact that he's not a gentleman.
23,00:00:53.17,00:00:53.17,>> I feel about ten pounds lighter.

31,00:01:15.38,00:01:15.38,alliance of four continued to crumble.
32,00:01:17.88,00:01:17.88,">> For you to say it like that, that's messed up."
33,00:01:19.88,00:01:19.88,>> And everybody here won't tell you because they're afraid to
34,00:01:21.79,00:01:21.79,tell you the truth! >> What are you talking about?
35,00:01:25.00,00:01:25.00,>> This foursome is like some psychotic joke.

39,00:01:38.25,00:01:38.25,the beam. But it was Casaya who took home
40,00:01:40.67,00:01:40.67,their second straight immunity. Casaya wins immunity!
41,00:01:44.25,00:01:44.25,">> Yeah, buddy. >> Yes!"
42,00:01:47.04,00:01:47.04,>> PROBST: Though Sally was next in line to be voted off...
43,00:01:50.42,00:01:50.42,>> It's a shame to pack up my stuff and leave here with so
44,00:01:52.46,00:01:52.46,much left to offer this tribe. >> PROBST: ...Austin made a bid
45,00:01:54.46,00:01:54.46,to keep her. >> We got to have our strongest
46,00:01:57.12,00:01:57.12,team. >> PROBST: Dan reminded his
47,00:02:01.58,00:02:01.58,tribe of their pact with Ruth Marie.

49,00:02:05.88,00:02:05.88,horses midstream is a big mistake.
50,00:02:09.25,00:02:09.25,It's crazy. >> PROBST: But at Tribal
51,00:02:13.04,00:02:13.04,"Council, the men chose strength over their alliance as Ruth"
52,00:02:16.17,00:02:16.17,Marie was voted out. 12 are left.
53,00:02:21.08,00:02:21.08,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
54,00:02:41.50,00:02:41.50,(birds singing) >> Pretty proud moment for me to
55,00:02:57.08,00:02:57.08,be the last girl standing on this tribe.
56,00:02:59.92,00:02:59.92,It's a very... how many women have left.
57,00:03:04.54,00:03:04.54,">> At Tribal Council last night, Ruth Marie went home."
58,00:03:07.54,00:03:07.54,"I was a little disappointed in that decision, but Nick, Austin"
59,00:03:11.25,00:03:11.25,and Terry said that Ruth Marie just couldn't hold her weight in
60,00:03:15.08,00:03:15.08,the challenges and that they wanted to switch over to Sally.
61,00:03:19.54,00:03:19.54,>> I miss Ruthy already. >> I do...
62,00:03:22.71,00:03:22.71,I was just going to say that. >> Every day that I spent with
63,00:03:24.79,00:03:24.79,"her, I was more and more amazed. >> Yeah, I'm really going to"
64,00:03:27.08,00:03:27.08,miss her. >> Ruth Marie ended up getting
65,00:03:28.92,00:03:28.92,"the votes and was sent home, and I am telling you, I have never"
66,00:03:32.62,00:03:32.62,felt so good in my whole life. >> That water is disgusting.
67,00:03:37.08,00:03:37.08,>> Coming in here and feeling kind of like the underdog and
68,00:03:39.46,00:03:39.46,"the outsider right off the bat, and the fact that the four men,"
69,00:03:43.25,00:03:43.25,"who have a very tight alliance, made a decision that I was"
70,00:03:46.25,00:03:46.25,valuable enough to keep around felt pretty darn good.
71,00:03:57.88,00:03:57.88,>> The game plan this morning is to get some water boiled so we
72,00:03:59.88,00:03:59.88,"have water to drink, stay hydrated."
73,00:04:10.96,00:04:10.96,>> I'm going to be designing a Zen rock garden.
74,00:04:13.42,00:04:13.42,"Um, just kind of bring kind of a Zen beauty to this place, 'cause"
75,00:04:18.00,00:04:18.00,it lacks it inside the campground and inside some of
76,00:04:20.00,00:04:20.00,the people's souls. >> It's like we never have an
77,00:04:25.33,00:04:25.33,easy fire day. >> It's just hard to understand.
78,00:04:28.21,00:04:28.21,"I mean, doing all the principles and making a fire perfectly."
79,00:04:31.38,00:04:31.38,>> I know. It's just wet wood.
80,00:04:36.21,00:04:36.21,>> I don't know what Bruce is doing over there.
81,00:04:41.33,00:04:41.33,>> He's doing his rock garden thing.
82,00:04:46.29,00:04:46.29,">> While we were making the fire, Bruce built a rock garden."
83,00:04:50.21,00:04:50.21,It was just a question of whether it was the appropriate
84,00:04:52.21,00:04:52.21,thing to build at the time. >> It's dire straits right now
85,00:05:02.21,00:05:02.21,"with the fire. >> Bruce, I've gotten firewood."
86,00:05:10.12,00:05:10.12,"You got to understand, this is a really tough fire right now,"
87,00:05:12.33,00:05:12.33,okay? You made your rock garden.
88,00:05:14.17,00:05:14.17,No one went complaining. I'm-I'm working on this.
89,00:05:16.25,00:05:16.25,"I'm doing... I'm working as a team, okay?"
90,00:05:21.96,00:05:21.96,"I definitely shouldn't have yelled at Bruce, and I felt bad"
91,00:05:24.25,00:05:24.25,about that. It was just a matter of whether
92,00:05:27.25,00:05:27.25,or not the tribe needed a rock garden or a fire.
93,00:05:30.38,00:05:30.38,"When we're in the situation, there's got to be priorities."
94,00:05:33.25,00:05:33.25,>> You attacked my character. When you do that...
95,00:05:35.50,00:05:35.50,>> How did I attack your character?
96,00:05:37.38,00:05:37.38,>> When you... when you just say that was nothing over there.
97,00:05:39.25,00:05:39.25,You don't have no idea why I'm building my rock garden.
98,00:05:40.96,00:05:40.96,>> When I said that was nothing? >> The rock garden.
99,00:05:42.71,00:05:42.71,>> I didn't say anything was nothing.
100,00:05:44.42,00:05:44.42,>> You come back with a childish...
101,00:05:46.21,00:05:46.21,That was childish to come back with.
102,00:05:47.75,00:05:47.75,">> So, you're... Hold on, hold on."
103,00:05:49.21,00:05:49.21,"You're calling me childish? >> No, that remark was."
104,00:05:51.21,00:05:51.21,"I said, ""The childish remark."" >> Okay."
105,00:05:53.83,00:05:53.83,There was no disrespecting. >> Okay.
106,00:05:56.79,00:05:56.79,>> If you can see... I see where you're coming from.
107,00:05:58.71,00:05:58.71,Just try to see where I'm coming from.
108,00:06:00.62,00:06:00.62,I wasn't trying to disrespect you.
109,00:06:02.46,00:06:02.46,>> I know you're-you're the master of the fire.
110,00:06:04.42,00:06:04.42,">> No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hey..."
111,00:06:06.25,00:06:06.25,">> That's why we... >> It's all about communication,"
112,00:06:07.79,00:06:07.79,"Bruce. >> Well, it is."
113,00:06:09.38,00:06:09.38,>> We're in a tough situation. >> But don't come back... you
114,00:06:11.08,00:06:11.08,"know... >> So, Bruce, if you could get"
115,00:06:13.12,00:06:13.12,some of that good wood... >> Okay.
116,00:06:14.88,00:06:14.88,>> ...that's what we need right now.
117,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,">> Okay, give me my machete. >> There it is."
118,00:06:18.21,00:06:18.21,"I'm the youngest person in this tribe, and sometimes I feel like"
119,00:06:20.17,00:06:20.17,I'm the oldest one in this tribe.
120,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,"Maybe I need kind of a little bit of a break, a little bit of"
121,00:06:23.79,00:06:23.79,"calmness, so, to be perfectly honest, I kind of want to go to"
122,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,"Exile Island. >> PROBST: Casaya, La Mina,"
123,00:06:32.75,00:06:32.75,"come on in! >> PROBST: Casaya, getting your"
124,00:06:45.00,00:06:45.00,first look at the new La Mina tribe.
125,00:06:47.00,00:06:47.00,Ruth Marie voted out at the last Tribal Council.
126,00:06:52.12,00:06:52.12,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
127,00:06:54.08,00:06:54.08,">> Yeah! >> PROBST: Okay, you are going"
128,00:06:56.83,00:06:56.83,"to transport rice, beans and fish from a boat to the shore."
129,00:07:01.17,00:07:01.17,You will designate one tribe member to be your retriever.
130,00:07:04.29,00:07:04.29,"On my go, they'll race out, retrieve one item, bring it"
131,00:07:06.79,00:07:06.79,back to shore. The rest of you will be lined up
132,00:07:08.96,00:07:08.96,like an assembly line. You'll toss the item from one
133,00:07:11.54,00:07:11.54,"person to the next. When you reach the last person,"
134,00:07:14.08,00:07:14.08,they'll toss it in the appropriate bin.
135,00:07:16.04,00:07:16.04,"The retriever goes back out, gets another item."
136,00:07:18.08,00:07:18.08,"First, you'll collect a bag of rice, then you'll collect a bag"
137,00:07:20.54,00:07:20.54,"of beans, then you get to the fish."
138,00:07:23.71,00:07:23.71,The fish are big. And when you get to the end of
139,00:07:26.12,00:07:26.12,"the line, the last person has to chop the head and the tail off"
140,00:07:29.25,00:07:29.25,"the fish, throw the body in the bin."
141,00:07:32.25,00:07:32.25,"Two rules: if you throw an item and the other person drops it,"
142,00:07:35.12,00:07:35.12,"you're responsible to get the item, come back to your mat and"
143,00:07:37.79,00:07:37.79,throw it again. Second rule-- swapping positions
144,00:07:40.29,00:07:40.29,is fine. You just need to tag out.
145,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,First tribe to get all their items in the appropriate bins
146,00:07:45.17,00:07:45.17,wins reward. Winning tribe gets it all.
147,00:07:47.79,00:07:47.79,">> Oh, my God. >> PROBST: You get all of your"
148,00:07:49.75,00:07:49.75,rice. You get all of your beans.
149,00:07:52.29,00:07:52.29,"You get all of your very large fish, and to go along with it,"
150,00:07:56.21,00:07:56.21,"some spices for the fish, some wine..."
151,00:07:59.00,00:07:59.00,(gasping) >> PROBST: ...and some cooking
152,00:08:01.00,00:08:01.00,"oil. >> Oh, my God!"
153,00:08:02.71,00:08:02.71,">> PROBST: For the losers, not all bad news."
154,00:08:04.75,00:08:04.75,You will not go home empty-handed.
155,00:08:06.96,00:08:06.96,The losing tribe will take back with them either their rice or
156,00:08:09.92,00:08:09.92,"their beans. In addition, one member from the"
157,00:08:13.12,00:08:13.12,losing tribe will be sent to Exile Island.
158,00:08:15.79,00:08:15.79,Big enough stakes? >> Yeah.
159,00:08:17.79,00:08:17.79,">> PROBST: Casaya, you have two extra members."
160,00:08:19.71,00:08:19.71,Sitting two people out. Who is it going to be?

162,00:08:23.38,00:08:23.38,>> PROBST: Courtney and Danielle will sit it out.
163,00:08:25.17,00:08:25.17,"Take a spot, we'll get started. Here we go, for reward."
164,00:08:30.58,00:08:30.58,"Survivors, ready? Go!"
165,00:08:37.33,00:08:37.33,>> Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

191,00:09:35.33,00:09:35.33,tail and get it in the bin. (grunting)
192,00:09:39.33,00:09:39.33,"Both guys whacking at it. Go, La Mina!"
193,00:09:45.42,00:09:45.42,Bruce slowing down on the chopping.
194,00:09:47.96,00:09:47.96,>> Bruce. >> PROBST: Watch your fingers.
195,00:09:51.08,00:09:51.08,Bruce really falling behind. La Mina with the lead now.
196,00:09:54.71,00:09:54.71,Austin with a good catch. Dan with a good catch.
197,00:09:58.12,00:09:58.12,(Bruce grunting) Bruce really having trouble.
198,00:10:05.58,00:10:05.58,(grunts) >> PROBST: Terry with a nice
199,00:10:08.04,00:10:08.04,grab. Go!
200,00:10:12.25,00:10:12.25,You can switch out! Shane in the water.
201,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,"Go, La Mina! >> Go, go, go, go!"
202,00:10:20.08,00:10:20.08,>> PROBST: Got to get eight total.
203,00:10:22.21,00:10:22.21,Reward at stake. Losers sending somebody to Exile

205,00:10:28.04,00:10:28.04,">> PROBST: Oh, nice catch by Cirie."
206,00:10:30.92,00:10:30.92,(overlapping shouting) Bruce can't handle it.
207,00:10:32.92,00:10:32.92,">> Go, go, get it, get it! >> Bruce, easy."
208,00:10:37.08,00:10:37.08,">> You need to get closer. >> PROBST: Bobby, Bobby's got"
209,00:10:41.04,00:10:41.04,it. La Mina with a big lead now.
210,00:10:45.08,00:10:45.08,Bobby's got to get the head and the tail off.
211,00:10:48.21,00:10:48.21,">> Power, Bobby! Power, Bobby! >> PROBST: Look at that."
212,00:10:51.00,00:10:51.00,"Go, Casaya! Go, La Mina!"
213,00:10:56.17,00:10:56.17,La Mina with a one-fish lead still.
214,00:10:58.54,00:10:58.54,Casaya making up some ground. La Mina working together well.
215,00:11:04.04,00:11:04.04,">> Go, Sal... >> PROBST: Sally can't handle"
216,00:11:06.67,00:11:06.67,"it. >> Yeah, baby!"
217,00:11:10.04,00:11:10.04,>> PROBST: Bobby's got it. La Mina really having trouble.
218,00:11:14.38,00:11:14.38,Dan's got to come back and toss it again.
219,00:11:17.46,00:11:17.46,Bobby making quick work of the fish.
220,00:11:19.75,00:11:19.75,"Go! >> Oh, come on, Sal."
221,00:11:24.42,00:11:24.42,"Come on, Sal. >> PROBST: Dan and Sally running"

227,00:11:43.12,00:11:43.12,You're good. Bobby making quick work of the
228,00:11:47.04,00:11:47.04,fish. Casaya pulling ahead.
229,00:11:52.00,00:11:52.00,"Go, Casaya! Go, La Mina!"
230,00:11:54.46,00:11:54.46,"We are tied, six-six. Got to get eight total."
231,00:11:58.88,00:11:58.88,"Shane falls down. >> Smaller, smaller."
232,00:12:01.71,00:12:01.71,>> PROBST: A lot of reward at stake.
233,00:12:03.62,00:12:03.62,">> Smaller, smaller. >> Underhand, underhand."
234,00:12:06.33,00:12:06.33,There you go. >> PROBST: Bobby's got it.
235,00:12:13.29,00:12:13.29,">> Come on, Bobby! >> PROBST: Bobby's been"
236,00:12:16.04,00:12:16.04,"fantastic with the knife. Go, Casaya!"
237,00:12:18.42,00:12:18.42,>> Switch! >> PROBST: Casaya switched out
238,00:12:20.21,00:12:20.21,again. Terry trying to catch up.
239,00:12:22.96,00:12:22.96,"Go, La Mina! We're tied, seven-seven."
240,00:12:26.04,00:12:26.04,This is the last fish. Casaya with the lead.
241,00:12:31.00,00:12:31.00,Shane with a good catch. Cirie with a catch.
242,00:12:34.92,00:12:34.92,"La Mina, gotta pick it up! >> Let's go! Come on now!"
243,00:12:38.33,00:12:38.33,>> PROBST: Bruce to Bobby. This could be it!
244,00:12:41.96,00:12:41.96,">> You got this, Bobby. >> PROBST: Get it in the bin."

246,00:12:48.12,00:12:48.12, Casaya! Wins reward! >> That was awesome.
247,00:12:52.83,00:12:52.83,">> Bobby! Yo, baby! Tonight we eat!"
248,00:12:58.12,00:12:58.12,">> PROBST: Once again, another very close challenge, but Casaya"
249,00:13:02.04,00:13:02.04,continues their winning streak-- four challenges in a row.
250,00:13:06.04,00:13:06.04,"La Mina, first you have a choice to make."
251,00:13:07.96,00:13:07.96,Do you want the rice or do you want the beans?
252,00:13:09.62,00:13:09.62,">> Beans. Now, Casaya, you have a choice"
253,00:13:11.71,00:13:11.71,"to make. Because La Mina lost, one person"
254,00:13:14.08,00:13:14.08,is going to Exile Island; you as the winning tribe are going to
255,00:13:17.21,00:13:17.21,"decide who that will be. >> Just out of respect, it's"
256,00:13:20.08,00:13:20.08,going to be Terry. >> PROBST: Terry.
257,00:13:21.92,00:13:21.92,"Terry, you'll return to the next immunity challenge."
258,00:13:25.21,00:13:25.21,You will compete with your tribe in that.
259,00:13:26.88,00:13:26.88,"Head on out. Casaya, congratulations."
260,00:13:34.12,00:13:34.12,You got some eating to do tonight.
261,00:13:35.58,00:13:35.58,>> Yay! >> PROBST: Grab your stuff.
262,00:13:37.92,00:13:37.92,"Head on back. >> Oh, my God."
263,00:13:47.25,00:13:47.25,(thunder crashes) >> Damn!
264,00:14:12.62,00:14:12.62,>> When we returned from reward challenge-- ta-da!-- and
265,00:14:17.33,00:14:17.33,there's a lake. >> This is a nightmare.
266,00:14:24.33,00:14:24.33,>> This is the biggest joke. >> Total nightmare.
267,00:14:27.00,00:14:27.00,">> Our best reward today by far, and we come home to a swamp."
268,00:14:31.12,00:14:31.12,"No fire. >> We have rice, we have beans,"
269,00:14:35.04,00:14:35.04,"we have wine and we have a ton of fish, but we can't cook it."
270,00:14:39.12,00:14:39.12,Everything is wet. We don't have any dry wood for
271,00:14:42.21,00:14:42.21,"fire. >> Straight raw, like sushi."
272,00:14:56.25,00:14:56.25,>> Of course. >> It has to be almost a hundred
273,00:14:58.54,00:14:58.54,"pounds of fish that we have here, and we're just cutting"
274,00:15:00.92,00:15:00.92,"it up and eating it as sashimi, raw fish, sushi."
275,00:15:08.08,00:15:08.08,">> This is cool for us to eat this like this, right?"
276,00:15:11.21,00:15:11.21,Ooh! I've never eaten raw fish. I hope I don't wake up in the
277,00:15:15.46,00:15:15.46,morning with some kind of sickness or something.
278,00:15:20.25,00:15:20.25,But they say it's okay to eat. >> You never had sushi?
279,00:15:22.58,00:15:22.58,>> No. >> What?
280,00:15:24.46,00:15:24.46,>> Excuse me. >> Kill me.
281,00:15:26.21,00:15:26.21,">> No, no. I'm just shocked and awed 'cause I eat it all the"
282,00:15:28.83,00:15:28.83,"time. >> Cheers, salut."
283,00:15:32.12,00:15:32.12,"Even though we've lost our home, we've won a great little prize."
284,00:15:36.08,00:15:36.08,">> This is a tough situation. It's two steps forward, three"
285,00:15:39.17,00:15:39.17,steps back. But I'm happy that we won.
286,00:15:41.96,00:15:41.96,We're bonding in our weird Casaya strange-fish way.
287,00:15:56.17,00:15:56.17,">> Cheers, guys. >> Yeah."
288,00:16:01.12,00:16:01.12,">> We made way too much, I think."
289,00:16:04.21,00:16:04.21,>> Mmm. >> We had a reward challenge and
290,00:16:06.75,00:16:06.75,the winner took all the spoils. And guess who won?
291,00:16:11.21,00:16:11.21,"Casaya, yet again. They walked away with fish,"
292,00:16:15.25,00:16:15.25,"beans, rice. We walked away with beans."
293,00:16:17.92,00:16:17.92,>> You guys gonna go in for seconds?
294,00:16:19.42,00:16:19.42,>> Go for it. >> You sure?
295,00:16:20.96,00:16:20.96,">> Yeah, take all you want. There's more than enough."
296,00:16:23.42,00:16:23.42,">> But we're, of course, absolutely jubilant to be"
297,00:16:26.25,00:16:26.25,able to have food. >> I feel nausea setting in.
298,00:16:30.04,00:16:30.04,>> I felt it as soon as I stopped eating.
299,00:16:32.83,00:16:32.83,"I'm just thinking it'll pass within 20, 30 minutes."
300,00:16:35.33,00:16:35.33,(exhales) >> How you feeling?
301,00:16:39.08,00:16:39.08,>> Not so hot. It's already working it's way
302,00:16:42.25,00:16:42.25,through me. My body's not responding too
303,00:16:44.00,00:16:44.00,well to putting the beans in the system.
304,00:16:47.62,00:16:47.62,Nick and I are experiencing a little bit of nausea.
305,00:16:51.12,00:16:51.12,Guess my system just wasn't quite ready for some food.
306,00:16:54.58,00:16:54.58,">> I guess, you know, your digestive system probably takes"
307,00:16:56.71,00:16:56.71,a break when you're not eating. I want this feeling in my
308,00:17:02.96,00:17:02.96,"stomach to go away, Dan. >> How are you doing?"
309,00:17:15.62,00:17:15.62,">> Well, I was feeling better... but I feel my stomach rumbling"
310,00:17:21.17,00:17:21.17,"again. >> I have to go, too, dude."
311,00:17:24.50,00:17:24.50,Do you? >> Yeah.
312,00:17:26.25,00:17:26.25,">> Oh, God, I got to go again. God. This sucks."
313,00:17:31.46,00:17:31.46,>> You know what? We probably didn't cook them enough.
314,00:17:34.29,00:17:34.29,">> Hey, Nick. >> Hey."
315,00:17:36.17,00:17:36.17,">> How you doing, bud. >> You guys do not want to know"
316,00:17:38.17,00:17:38.17,the details of that excursion. >> You have both ends going?
317,00:17:40.71,00:17:40.71,>> Yeah. >> That stuff just wrecked me.
318,00:17:44.00,00:17:44.00,"That was just gross. >> How you doing, brother?"
319,00:17:47.21,00:17:47.21,>> No doubt I'm going to have to go again in about five
320,00:17:50.62,00:17:50.62,"minutes. >> I threw up, too."
321,00:17:52.67,00:17:52.67,">> Oh, you threw up, too? >> Yeah."
322,00:17:55.00,00:17:55.00,>> I wish I could do that. >> The beans we ate got myself
323,00:17:58.21,00:17:58.21,as well as Austin really sick. Gastrointestinal details that
324,00:18:01.38,00:18:01.38,probably shouldn't be discussed at this time.
325,00:18:05.62,00:18:05.62,">> Well, I got to go again. >> I got to go right now, dude."
326,00:18:11.71,00:18:11.71,(thunder crashes) >> Yeah.
327,00:18:44.04,00:18:44.04,>> They just do whatever they want to do.
328,00:18:46.67,00:18:46.67,"They always, they don't think of other people first."
329,00:18:52.33,00:18:52.33,">> I hear ya... (hiccups) >> There's so much to do, I"
330,00:19:20.83,00:19:20.83,don't know where to begin. That's gross.
331,00:19:24.29,00:19:24.29,I just feel like everything's trashed.
332,00:19:28.58,00:19:28.58,"Luckily, last night, the rained stopped, so the lake"
333,00:19:31.88,00:19:31.88,didn't go into our shelter. And I don't know what happened
334,00:19:35.12,00:19:35.12,to Bruce and Bobby. Apparently they slept in the
335,00:19:38.00,00:19:38.00,bathroom or something. I can't wait to hear that story.
336,00:19:43.38,00:19:43.38,">> I didn't see it. If they did that, that is so"
337,00:19:45.71,00:19:45.71,wrong. Like seriously... that's so not
338,00:19:49.17,00:19:49.17,right. (laughs)
339,00:20:01.75,00:20:01.75,>> I'll get it. I got to Casa de Charmin to get
340,00:20:05.75,00:20:05.75,"some soap, and there's Bruce folded over, I mean literally"
341,00:20:09.08,00:20:09.08,"folded in half, and there at his feet-- hmm?-- the empty bottle"
342,00:20:14.17,00:20:14.17,of wine. >> I just threw it away.
343,00:20:19.04,00:20:19.04,>> I would have to be dead and someone would have to pour it
344,00:20:23.04,00:20:23.04,down my throat for me to drink the last bottle of wine that we
345,00:20:25.17,00:20:25.17,as a tribe won. >> What happened to that last
346,00:20:37.12,00:20:37.12,bottle of wine? >> You drank it?
347,00:20:40.29,00:20:40.29,">> Yeah. >> You and Bruce, or just you?"
348,00:20:42.38,00:20:42.38,">> I ended up sharing it with him, but I thought..."
349,00:20:44.71,00:20:44.71,I didn't think I had any place to sleep...
350,00:20:46.42,00:20:46.42,">> You drank it yourself? >> Yeah, that's what my plan"
351,00:20:48.54,00:20:48.54,"was, and then I went in there... gave him some."
352,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,>> How do you feel about that? >> You feel good about it?
353,00:20:53.17,00:20:53.17,>> Yeah. >> Bobby said there was no room
354,00:20:55.42,00:20:55.42,"in the shelter, but there was plenty of room."
355,00:20:58.21,00:20:58.21,It was really bad judgment of Bobby to open the bottle of
356,00:21:01.67,00:21:01.67,wine and drink it. We all worked really hard for
357,00:21:04.04,00:21:04.04,that. Wine out here is like super
358,00:21:06.25,00:21:06.25,special. Now none of us really trust
359,00:21:08.71,00:21:08.71,Bobby. We were all supposed to
360,00:21:10.12,00:21:10.12,celebrate and drink that wine together.
361,00:21:11.38,00:21:11.38,">> Right, and I brought it in there, we were supposed to drink"
362,00:21:13.96,00:21:13.96,"it last night... >> Yeah, but why would you ever"
363,00:21:15.79,00:21:15.79,"do that on your own? >> 'Cause, you guys..."
364,00:21:17.38,00:21:17.38,I didn't have a place to sleep...
365,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,>> You did. >> I didn't think I did.
366,00:21:20.42,00:21:20.42,"Maybe I did, but when I called out..."
367,00:21:22.08,00:21:22.08,">> You really made a bad, bad call."
368,00:21:23.75,00:21:23.75,>> I don't feel bad that I stole your wine.
369,00:21:25.58,00:21:25.58,"Like I feel bad that I deprived them of wine, but I have no hard"
370,00:21:28.67,00:21:28.67,feelings whatsoever about the fact that you've been deprived
371,00:21:31.33,00:21:31.33,of wine. Courtney definitely had a right
372,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,to be upset. I just don't need to hear it.
373,00:21:38.21,00:21:38.21,I really don't care what she thinks.
374,00:21:39.67,00:21:39.67,She's probably one of the two or three most annoying people
375,00:21:41.88,00:21:41.88,probably in the history of the world.
376,00:21:43.29,00:21:43.29,>> It's so over. I don't have the energy for
377,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,this. The energy I want to put on is
378,00:21:47.17,00:21:47.17,for the camp and that's it. Not on this stupid stuff.
379,00:22:01.58,00:22:01.58,>> Something told me I was coming back here again.
380,00:22:05.12,00:22:05.12,I am on Exile Island for the second time.
381,00:22:08.58,00:22:08.58,There's one less thing I have to look for right now because I
382,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,have the hidden immunity idol. I am more independent on my own
383,00:22:15.83,00:22:15.83,here. Everyone leaves me alone.
384,00:22:18.21,00:22:18.21,I tend to have more time for the survival part of what I
385,00:22:20.83,00:22:20.83,need to do about getting rehydrated and getting food so
386,00:22:23.75,00:22:23.75,that I'm strong for the challenges.
387,00:22:29.08,00:22:29.08,Finally a fire. I am really concerned about my
388,00:22:35.21,00:22:35.21,tribe mates. My worst fear for La Mina right
389,00:22:38.92,00:22:38.92,now is they're not properly feeding themselves and keeping
390,00:22:42.04,00:22:42.04,hydrated. That's my worst fear.
391,00:22:56.62,00:22:56.62,">> Creepy coffin. >> Guys, we got tree mail!"
392,00:23:00.21,00:23:00.21,>> Tree mail! Here we go.

404,00:23:36.79,00:23:36.79,seeing as we've lost four in a row and are going in

406,00:23:58.21,00:23:58.21,"We'll now bring in Terry, once again returning from Exile"

424,00:24:56.08,00:24:56.08,together one way. First tribe to build it

508,00:30:10.96,00:30:10.96,us to talk about voting someone off.
509,00:30:13.21,00:30:13.21,The group wants Bob out. I don't want Bob to go.
510,00:30:16.96,00:30:16.96,I think he's proved himself in challenges.

512,00:30:28.04,00:30:28.04,We cannot control Bruce. We can't.

515,00:30:36.21,00:30:36.21,>> Nothing. Are we good at Bruce?
516,00:30:38.21,00:30:38.21,>> This is really stupid but all right.
517,00:30:40.71,00:30:40.71,"It's stupid, I'm telling you it's going to end up costing"
518,00:30:43.04,00:30:43.04,people. >> It's not.
519,00:30:45.33,00:30:45.33,>> Bobby came from young guys camp to begin with.
520,00:30:48.75,00:30:48.75,"If we get to the merge, and Austin and Nick are still"
521,00:30:51.25,00:30:51.25,"around, I've always been worried about Bobby joining back up"
522,00:30:53.42,00:30:53.42,with them. So that was the reason why I
523,00:30:55.71,00:30:55.71,didn't want Bobby to make the merge.
524,00:30:57.79,00:30:57.79,>> He's not going to flip. >> I don't care.
525,00:31:00.38,00:31:00.38,"Whatever you guys want. >> What, you're not going to"

528,00:31:07.25,00:31:07.25,>> Oh. >> What are you babbling about?
529,00:31:09.38,00:31:09.38,"Like, what are you talking about?"
530,00:31:11.29,00:31:11.29,">> Oh, I just... I didn't hear what you said."
531,00:31:13.50,00:31:13.50,">> Okay, so right now you're writing down Bruce."
532,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,The four of us are all writing down Bruce.
533,00:31:17.21,00:31:17.21,"Done deal, no problem? That's not a problem?"
534,00:31:22.88,00:31:22.88,">> Oh, my God! I'm walking on eggshells as it"
535,00:31:26.04,00:31:26.04,"is. Because initially way back, I"
536,00:31:29.25,00:31:29.25,"was told I'd be the next to go. I'm just trying to lay low, fly"
537,00:31:33.46,00:31:33.46,"under the radar, let them kill each other, and don't think"
538,00:31:37.12,00:31:37.12,about me for... (laughs)
539,00:31:40.04,00:31:40.04,for the vote tonight. >> I don't know what anybody
540,00:31:45.17,00:31:45.17,"else tells you, but you were going tonight."
541,00:31:47.79,00:31:47.79,Straight up. You were gone.
542,00:31:49.79,00:31:49.79,>> Mm-hmm. >> But Bruce is now gone.
543,00:31:52.08,00:31:52.08,>> I know one of the things that people are worried about
544,00:31:54.42,00:31:54.42,is that if we do make a merge and we're 5-5 that I'll jump.
545,00:31:57.62,00:31:57.62,"I'm not jumping. >> Okay, so when we get to the"
546,00:32:02.00,00:32:02.00,"merge, you're not going to flop? >> Yeah."
547,00:32:04.04,00:32:04.04,>> You won't? >> Yeah.
548,00:32:05.38,00:32:05.38,>> Swear on my kid? >> Yeah.
549,00:32:07.25,00:32:07.25,">> Swear on my kid. >> Yeah, I won't swear on your"

551,00:32:11.17,00:32:11.17,>> I'll swear on your kid. >> You won't flop?
552,00:32:13.21,00:32:13.21,>> Right. And you're promising me what?
553,00:32:15.71,00:32:15.71,>> I promise you I'm getting you the sixth.
554,00:32:17.33,00:32:17.33,>> Yep. I'm good?
555,00:32:18.67,00:32:18.67,">> On my kid? >> Mm-hmm, on your kid, on"
556,00:32:20.25,00:32:20.25,Boston. >> Awesome.
557,00:32:21.75,00:32:21.75,>> All right. >> This is my first Tribal

559,00:32:35.00,00:32:35.00,it low-key. I get frustrated with Courtney
560,00:32:41.42,00:32:41.42,doing yoga on the Zen rock garden.
561,00:32:46.21,00:32:46.21,"To me, it's disgusting. She has no respect for me or"
562,00:32:51.25,00:32:51.25,anybody. We've got the whole beach here
563,00:32:55.79,00:32:55.79,and she picks the spot I'm at. I'd rather be on Exile Island
564,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,than be around Courtney. >> What do you think about
565,00:33:05.17,00:33:05.17,Bruce? >> I trust him.
566,00:33:06.75,00:33:06.75,>> 100%? >> Yeah.
567,00:33:08.62,00:33:08.62,I do trust him. I don't trust Bobby.
568,00:33:13.04,00:33:13.04,"I don't. Courtney, why don't we switch"
569,00:33:15.42,00:33:15.42,this game up right now and vote...
570,00:33:17.12,00:33:17.12,">> I was just thinking about-- I was like, ""At least I got my"
571,00:33:19.12,00:33:19.12,"girls."" >> ...vote off Bobby?"
572,00:33:20.71,00:33:20.71,>> You know what I mean? >> Let's vote off Bobby.
573,00:33:22.62,00:33:22.62,">> Dude, I'm just scared of-- I'm just trying..."
574,00:33:24.25,00:33:24.25,>> I'm scared of that. I don't like that.
575,00:33:26.04,00:33:26.04,"Aras is putting himself, setting himself up."
576,00:33:28.08,00:33:28.08,>> Aras is setting himself up so hard-core...
577,00:33:30.46,00:33:30.46,>> Mm-hmm. >> ...and he's going to be so
578,00:33:31.83,00:33:31.83,"impossible to beat. >> How about we just get Shane,"
579,00:33:34.04,00:33:34.04,"me, you-- us four vote for Bobby."
580,00:33:38.54,00:33:38.54,Aras wanted Bruce gone. I just-- I didn't feel
581,00:33:41.17,00:33:41.17,comfortable with that. I wanted Bruce to stay and I
582,00:33:44.79,00:33:44.79,"wanted Bobby to go, so I took control and I said this is not"
583,00:33:47.62,00:33:47.62,what I want. Keep Bruce.
584,00:33:50.71,00:33:50.71,I'm telling you it's a better decision for all of us.
585,00:33:54.83,00:33:54.83,It's less risky. >> Bobby's not going to flop.
586,00:33:57.33,00:33:57.33,>> I just don't trust him. >> I don't trust him either.
587,00:33:59.46,00:33:59.46,">> Okay, here's the deal. I can't vote him off."
588,00:34:01.50,00:34:01.50,I swore on my kid that he was the sixth.
589,00:34:03.71,00:34:03.71,I can't. >> Of course he's going to swear
590,00:34:06.04,00:34:06.04,on your kid. Why wouldn't he?
591,00:34:08.04,00:34:08.04,He knows he's getting voted off. He's going to say anything.
592,00:34:10.88,00:34:10.88,>> That's-- here's the deal. >> Bruce would stay with us more
593,00:34:13.17,00:34:13.17,than Bobby would. >> I agree.
594,00:34:14.71,00:34:14.71,">> Well, why didn't you tell me that an hour ago, Courtney?"
595,00:34:18.17,00:34:18.17,You said an hour ago... >> Don't yell at me.
596,00:34:20.33,00:34:20.33,">> I'm just yelling in general. And stop with the ""don't yell at"
597,00:34:24.00,00:34:24.00,"me."" I'm just-- we're talking."
598,00:34:25.88,00:34:25.88,You wouldn't listen to me when I was telling you all this stuff
599,00:34:28.08,00:34:28.08,"about Bobby. >> Well, you were right."
600,00:34:29.12,00:34:29.12,>> I don't want Bobby making it to the merge.
601,00:34:31.04,00:34:31.04,>> You were right. >> You were right.
602,00:34:32.29,00:34:32.29,">> You were right. >> You were right, you were"
603,00:34:34.08,00:34:34.08,right. >> You were right and now you've
604,00:34:37.83,00:34:37.83,been talked to and changed your mind.
605,00:34:40.33,00:34:40.33,You were right from the beginning.
606,00:34:41.54,00:34:41.54,">> I mean, honestly. >> Everyone's out of their mind."
607,00:34:44.12,00:34:44.12,There's nothing I can do. I told everybody initially that
608,00:34:47.17,00:34:47.17,Bobby should go and then they all freaked out and said
609,00:34:49.50,00:34:49.50,"nothing. They're like women, you know"
610,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,"what I mean, and now they're going back to Bobby."
611,00:34:54.00,00:34:54.00,"So it's like, you know, who knows?"
612,00:35:11.17,00:35:11.17,>> PROBST: Everybody has a torch except Bruce.
613,00:35:14.12,00:35:14.12,There's one on the end. Go ahead and grab it.
614,00:35:16.38,00:35:16.38,"Approach a flame and get fire. Fire's gone, so are you."
615,00:35:27.79,00:35:27.79,"Shane, last time you guys were here, I kind of felt as though"
616,00:35:31.71,00:35:31.71,this was a tribe that was in a bit of disarray.
617,00:35:34.62,00:35:34.62,Has that changed? >> I would say that we are the
618,00:35:37.04,00:35:37.04,dysfunctional functional tribe. I think when it comes to
619,00:35:40.75,00:35:40.75,"challenges, we step up and we know how to work together, but"
620,00:35:43.67,00:35:43.67,"this tribe can be really, really tiring."
621,00:35:46.04,00:35:46.04,>> PROBST: Let's talk about what's going on at camp life.
622,00:35:48.58,00:35:48.58,You've had some heavy downpours. How's the shelter holding up?
623,00:35:52.04,00:35:52.04,>> I ended up sleeping in the outhouse that night.
624,00:35:54.67,00:35:54.67,">> PROBST: In the rain? >> Yeah, in the outhouse."
625,00:35:57.21,00:35:57.21,>> With the bottle of wine. >> I went in there just kind of
626,00:35:59.67,00:35:59.67,trying to get comfortable for about an hour and all of a
627,00:36:01.46,00:36:01.46,"sudden I hear a knock on the door, and Bobby shows up with a"
628,00:36:04.42,00:36:04.42,"bottle of wine-- and at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning in the"
629,00:36:07.04,00:36:07.04,"freezing rain with my butt sore-- and I said ""I could use a"
630,00:36:10.29,00:36:10.29,"drink."" >> PROBST: Did anyone know,"
631,00:36:12.21,00:36:12.21,"Bobby, that you took the bottle of wine?"
632,00:36:13.92,00:36:13.92,"Was that okay with them? >> No, they didn't know and I"
633,00:36:16.38,00:36:16.38,found out later that it wasn't okay.
634,00:36:18.42,00:36:18.42,But the reason why Bruce and I ended up in the outhouse is that
635,00:36:21.00,00:36:21.00,the spots that we had reserved were taken and I was left to
636,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"sleep exposed to the rain. So I was like, ""All right, well,"
637,00:36:26.04,00:36:26.04,now I got this bottle of wine and everybody I was supposed to
638,00:36:28.04,00:36:28.04,"share it with is asleep and my spot's been taken, so, all"
639,00:36:30.25,00:36:30.25,"right, let me go over here and get my drink on with my boy"
640,00:36:32.42,00:36:32.42,"Bruce."" >> PROBST: I've got to say if"
641,00:36:35.25,00:36:35.25,"I'm the other five people, I'm looking at you and Bruce and"
642,00:36:37.62,00:36:37.62,"thinking, ""You guys don't want to be a part of this tribe?"
643,00:36:40.08,00:36:40.08,"Tribal Council is easy."" >> Oh, I agree."
644,00:36:42.25,00:36:42.25,It was very-- I gave them plenty of ammunition.
645,00:36:44.79,00:36:44.79,"You know? I didn't think it was wrong, but"
646,00:36:46.08,00:36:46.08,I understood people could be disappointed.
647,00:36:47.58,00:36:47.58,"What I apologized for wasn't the act, but it was for the way it"
648,00:36:50.21,00:36:50.21,made people feel if it made people feel a certain way.
649,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,">> PROBST: Cirie, did Bobby make a mistake?"
650,00:36:55.88,00:36:55.88,What did Bobby do from your point of view?
651,00:36:59.12,00:36:59.12,">> I think it was a huge, huge mistake only because we all as a"
652,00:37:05.08,00:37:05.08,"group fought for the reward challenge, and the reasoning"
653,00:37:09.96,00:37:09.96,that he's coming up with just doesn't sound good to me.
654,00:37:13.33,00:37:13.33,>> But I also feel like we're all getting on Bob.
655,00:37:16.25,00:37:16.25,Bruce knew very well as well that there was three other
656,00:37:19.29,00:37:19.29,people that wanted that wine. >> I'm just as guilty and I
657,00:37:22.29,00:37:22.29,"apologize to the group now, but even then nobody came up to me"
658,00:37:26.25,00:37:26.25,"and said, ""Bruce, you ass, you drank that."""
659,00:37:28.42,00:37:28.42,"I'm just going with the group, and if they made it clear it was"
660,00:37:32.21,00:37:32.21,"just horribly wrong, you could have talked to me."
661,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,">> But, Bruce, the onus is not on them to ask for you to"
662,00:37:38.08,00:37:38.08,explain yourself. I think that you're responsible
663,00:37:40.12,00:37:40.12,"to go up to the people in the group and to say, ""Look, I made"
664,00:37:43.25,00:37:43.25,"a selfish decision and I apologize."""
665,00:37:45.25,00:37:45.25,"I mean, to Bob's credit, he lived up to it, said, ""Yo, I did"
666,00:37:48.50,00:37:48.50,"this,"" but to just kind of pretend like it didn't happen,"
667,00:37:51.12,00:37:51.12,to shuck it off your shoulders...
668,00:37:52.08,00:37:52.08,>> It wasn't even on my mind today.
669,00:37:53.42,00:37:53.42,There was so much that we had to do.
670,00:37:55.29,00:37:55.29,"That probably was the furthest thing from my mind, honestly."
671,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,">> PROBST: Bruce, do you feel unappreciated?"
672,00:38:01.12,00:38:01.12,">> Oh, yeah, at times, because they ask for my suggestion, then"
673,00:38:04.71,00:38:04.71,they challenge it. I've never been challenged more
674,00:38:08.04,00:38:08.04,times in my life on advice that was asked for me in over a whole
675,00:38:11.88,00:38:11.88,year combined with thousands of students.
676,00:38:14.04,00:38:14.04,"It's unbelievable. >> But Bruce, we are not your"
677,00:38:15.83,00:38:15.83,"pupils. All right, we're your"
678,00:38:17.83,00:38:17.83,"tribesmen, and so when you do get challenged, you can't look"
679,00:38:20.04,00:38:20.04,"at it as some sort of ego blow, but, no, this is a tribe"
680,00:38:22.46,00:38:22.46,learning to work together. >> You're completely wrong
681,00:38:24.00,00:38:24.00,there. I don't think that.
682,00:38:24.92,00:38:24.92,I was just throwing that out. >> I just think he just feels
683,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,like he's not getting the respect that he deserves.
684,00:38:29.58,00:38:29.58,"He's an older man, he's a wiser man, he has more experience than"
685,00:38:33.08,00:38:33.08,"everybody, and I just think sometimes he doesn't get the"
686,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"respect that he deserves. >> You know, I apologize to you"
687,00:38:39.04,00:38:39.04,"guys, and I'll tell you I'm gonna take everything you say to"
688,00:38:41.62,00:38:41.62,"heart. You know, if something is going"
689,00:38:43.12,00:38:43.12,"to bother me, I'll clear it up right on the spot."
690,00:38:45.83,00:38:45.83,Then you guys are in for it because you'll hear more of me
691,00:38:48.33,00:38:48.33,"then. You guys, I appreciate you guys."
692,00:38:51.04,00:38:51.04,"Come on. I will, I will."
693,00:38:55.17,00:38:55.17,"That's, that's a promise. >> PROBST: Before we get to the"
694,00:38:59.12,00:38:59.12,"vote, Bruce is the only one of this tribe that's been to Exile"
695,00:39:01.79,00:39:01.79,Island. He could have found the hidden
696,00:39:03.25,00:39:03.25,"immunity idol. Whether he did, it would not"
697,00:39:06.00,00:39:06.00,come into play until after the vote.
698,00:39:08.04,00:39:08.04,"Cirie, you're up. >> Bobby, you're just too"
699,00:39:26.21,00:39:26.21,"egotistical and you're selfish. >> Bruce, I just didn't think I"
700,00:39:39.67,00:39:39.67,could trust you. >> This is a throwaway vote.
701,00:39:50.08,00:39:50.08,It doesn't mean anything. I'm trying to make my vote go
702,00:39:53.00,00:39:53.00,away. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
703,00:39:58.92,00:39:58.92,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
704,00:40:10.67,00:40:10.67,decision is final. The person voted out will be
705,00:40:12.71,00:40:12.71,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
706,00:40:14.88,00:40:14.88,I'll read the votes. First vote: Courtney.
707,00:40:24.04,00:40:24.04,Bruce. Bobby.
708,00:40:30.17,00:40:30.17,One vote Bobby. Aras.
709,00:40:35.08,00:40:35.08,"That's one vote each for Aras, Courtney, Bruce and Bobby."
710,00:40:41.08,00:40:41.08,Bruce. Two votes Bruce.
711,00:40:48.08,00:40:48.08,Bobby. Here's where we stand-- two
712,00:40:50.25,00:40:50.25,"votes Bobby, two votes Bruce, one vote Courtney, one vote"
713,00:40:54.12,00:40:54.12,Aras. One vote left.
714,00:41:00.04,00:41:00.04,Bobby. Fifth person voted out of
715,00:41:02.42,00:41:02.42,"Survivor: Exile Island. Bobby, the tribe has spoken."
716,00:41:13.92,00:41:13.92,"It's time for you to go. Well, no doubt in my mind you"
717,00:41:22.21,00:41:22.21,"were in disarray when you walked in here tonight, but maybe the"
718,00:41:25.62,00:41:25.62,honesty shared here tonight could be the answer to bringing
719,00:41:29.08,00:41:29.08,"this group together. Grab your torches, head back to"
720,00:41:31.38,00:41:31.38,camp. Good night.
