1,00:00:01.27,00:00:01.27,(Jeff Probst) Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.43,00:00:03.43,Boran worried that the merge might not happen as expected.
3,00:00:07.17,00:00:07.17,- If we eat all our food and there's no merger
4,00:00:08.67,00:00:08.67,"after three days, we have no food."
5,00:00:11.17,00:00:11.17,"- Bon appetit, Samburu."
6,00:00:12.97,00:00:12.97,"(Probst) At the reward challenge,"
7,00:00:14.83,00:00:14.83,Samburu won a picnic lunch.
8,00:00:16.60,00:00:16.60,"- Oh, look at this sandwich."
9,00:00:18.63,00:00:18.63,"- I swear to God, it's the best thing I've ever tasted."
10,00:00:20.63,00:00:20.63,"- It's orgasmic. - Oh, my God."
11,00:00:22.63,00:00:22.63,"(Probst) Back at Boran, they had their own feast."
12,00:00:25.10,00:00:25.10,- One of you say your good-byes.
13,00:00:27.83,00:00:27.83,- Oh.
14,00:00:29.40,00:00:29.40,- That skin tastes delicious.
15,00:00:30.93,00:00:30.93,- The chicken tastes great.
16,00:00:32.27,00:00:32.27,"It's just, mwah!"
17,00:00:34.20,00:00:34.20,- Yeah!
18,00:00:35.87,00:00:35.87,"(Probst) At the immunity challenge, Boran was victorious."
19,00:00:38.73,00:00:38.73,Immunity for Boran! - Yes!
20,00:00:40.93,00:00:40.93,"(Probst) Sending Samburu back to Tribal Council,"
21,00:00:43.20,00:00:43.20,where the voting was deadlocked between Lindsey and Tom.
22,00:00:47.27,00:00:47.27,And we're deadlocked.
23,00:00:48.63,00:00:48.63,- I'm so sorry.
24,00:00:49.63,00:00:49.63,"- Hey, it's okay."
25,00:00:50.87,00:00:50.87,"Guys, it's a game."
26,00:00:53.00,00:00:53.00,(Probst) But with four previous votes stacked against her...
27,00:00:55.83,00:00:55.83,The tribe has spoken.
28,00:00:58.53,00:00:58.53,Lindsey took the fall.
29,00:01:01.43,00:01:01.43,- Bye.
30,00:01:02.47,00:01:02.47,(Probst) Ten are left.
31,00:01:03.83,00:01:03.83,Tonight one more will go.
32,00:01:07.00,00:01:07.00,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
33,00:02:25.33,00:02:25.33,- I know Lindsey left tribal council looking like a jackass.
34,00:02:29.00,00:02:29.00,"Oh, my God, I'm so glad Lindsey's gone."
35,00:02:31.37,00:02:31.37,Can I just say that again?
36,00:02:32.37,00:02:32.37,I am so glad Lindsey is gone.
37,00:02:35.30,00:02:35.30,I could not have taken this merge with her whining
38,00:02:37.93,00:02:37.93,and crying and bawling and being a baby.
39,00:02:40.33,00:02:40.33,Whatever happened to leaving with dignity?
40,00:02:42.47,00:02:42.47,When you have eight people like this and they split
41,00:02:45.33,00:02:45.33,"directly in the middle,"
42,00:02:46.67,00:02:46.67,"if you don't go with one side or the other,"
43,00:02:47.97,00:02:47.97,you're the first one out. - Right.
44,00:02:50.10,00:02:50.10,"- So we had to say, ""Okay, Silas and Lindsey, this is it."
45,00:02:52.63,00:02:52.63,- We're here.
46,00:02:53.97,00:02:53.97,- And when somebody like Lindsey and Silas come up
47,00:02:55.67,00:02:55.67,"and they're like, gonna protect you..."
48,00:02:57.10,00:02:57.10,- Yeah.
49,00:02:58.20,00:02:58.20,- Then you feel like you owe them.
50,00:03:00.17,00:03:00.17,"And they did, that's what I felt like, I felt protected"
51,00:03:02.17,00:03:02.17,while they were around me. - Very true.
52,00:03:03.83,00:03:03.83,- Lindsey's gone.
53,00:03:05.37,00:03:05.37,"And the other two, uh, they're nervous as a whore in church."
54,00:03:10.37,00:03:10.37,"- The ethics of this is killing me because I don't,"
55,00:03:12.37,00:03:12.37,"I mean, I want to push myself..."
56,00:03:13.37,00:03:13.37,"- It's a hard call, yeah."
57,00:03:14.87,00:03:14.87,"- Right, I'm like, I want to push myself more, but yet I've"
58,00:03:16.37,00:03:16.37,given my word that we'll all do this together.
59,00:03:18.90,00:03:18.90,"And then I'm like, the game is about yourself."
60,00:03:21.00,00:03:21.00,You know this is a selfish game when you come in to play it.
61,00:03:23.33,00:03:23.33,"And it's so hard, I mean, it's--"
62,00:03:24.87,00:03:24.87,"- You make your bed, you've got to lay in it, and I think they"
63,00:03:27.90,00:03:27.90,laid in it a little bit last night and got the wiggles.
64,00:03:30.60,00:03:30.60,"- Do you want to snuggle with me tonight or Kim, I mean Kelly?"
65,00:03:32.97,00:03:32.97,"- Well, I usually sleep with you, so..."
66,00:03:34.90,00:03:34.90,"- Ooh, fine. Right there, baby."
67,00:03:37.43,00:03:37.43,"- I'm like, why are you changing this now?"
68,00:03:40.10,00:03:40.10,- It's different now.
69,00:03:41.63,00:03:41.63,"I mean, we're in the minority,"
70,00:03:42.93,00:03:42.93,and we're in the minority for the first time.
71,00:03:45.30,00:03:45.30,"Kim and I will still have a relationship, but I'm going"
72,00:03:47.60,00:03:47.60,to try my hardest to have
73,00:03:48.90,00:03:48.90,"a distance between the two of us,"
74,00:03:51.63,00:03:51.63,just simply because one of us is gonna go before the other one.
75,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
76,00:04:07.07,00:04:07.07,(rooster crowing)
77,00:04:11.37,00:04:11.37,- Yesterday we had chicken.
78,00:04:12.70,00:04:12.70,"Oh, the chicken tasted great."
79,00:04:14.83,00:04:14.83,We all took our turn on it. It was awesome.
80,00:04:17.27,00:04:17.27,It was the best thing I've had here so far.
81,00:04:21.00,00:04:21.00,"Unfortunately, I had a little problem digesting the chicken."
82,00:04:24.77,00:04:24.77,"It was good, but you know, I haven't, my system hasn't had"
83,00:04:27.03,00:04:27.03,fat or grease in it for a while.
84,00:04:28.53,00:04:28.53,So I got up this morning with a little rumbling in my stomach.
85,00:04:31.57,00:04:31.57,And so I took my shovel out into the bush to do my business.
86,00:04:42.80,00:04:42.80,"By the time I got done, I looked up and there were a nice little"
87,00:04:46.30,00:04:46.30,"herd of elephant north of me, and I had no idea."
88,00:04:49.43,00:04:49.43,"You forget that, sometimes, that you're in Africa,"
89,00:04:51.87,00:04:51.87,"because we've been here so long,"
90,00:04:53.37,00:04:53.37,"and today I kind of was lax on my security,"
91,00:04:56.13,00:04:56.13,"not paying attention, because my stomach"
92,00:04:57.57,00:04:57.57,was rumbling a little bit.
93,00:04:59.13,00:04:59.13,"While I was doing my business, I could have got trampled."
94,00:05:01.23,00:05:01.23,It would have been a really--
95,00:05:02.83,00:05:02.83,a really embarrassing way to die.
96,00:05:05.43,00:05:05.43,(elephant trumpeting)
97,00:05:08.03,00:05:08.03,- (yawns)
98,00:05:09.47,00:05:09.47,- Think we're going to merge?
99,00:05:13.93,00:05:13.93,- Maybe.
100,00:05:15.43,00:05:15.43,We don't know what's going on right now.
101,00:05:17.43,00:05:17.43,"Today we thought this would be merger day with the other tribe,"
102,00:05:20.30,00:05:20.30,but so far we're just pretty much hanging out.
103,00:05:25.30,00:05:25.30,"- We're talking about reward challenge, immunity challenge,"
104,00:05:27.73,00:05:27.73,but we've learned quickly to learn that just when you think
105,00:05:30.23,00:05:30.23,"there's a pattern, there is no pattern."
106,00:05:31.67,00:05:31.67,So we're just basically kind of just hanging loose and waiting
107,00:05:33.87,00:05:33.87,to see what happens.
108,00:05:36.30,00:05:36.30,"- Got a little thick, guys."
109,00:05:38.13,00:05:38.13,"Dig in, dig in. Dig in."
110,00:05:40.63,00:05:40.63,- You guys thinking about that chicken last night?
111,00:05:42.70,00:05:42.70,- I was thinking about that chicken this morning
112,00:05:44.23,00:05:44.23,when my butt blew up.
113,00:05:47.07,00:05:47.07,"- Oh, really?"
114,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,- Really.
115,00:05:49.80,00:05:49.80,"- It was good, though."
116,00:05:51.27,00:05:51.27,- These flies don't even move when you shake at them anymore.
117,00:05:53.03,00:05:53.03,- I know it.
118,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,"- Oh, yeah, it's just Sunday brunch."
119,00:05:55.93,00:05:55.93,"Newspaper in one hand, cornmeal in the other,"
120,00:05:58.80,00:05:58.80,lounging on the sofa.
121,00:06:00.63,00:06:00.63,- What is brunch again exactly?
122,00:06:04.40,00:06:04.40,"- Brunch, depending on where you go, is all and any kind"
123,00:06:07.40,00:06:07.40,"of seafood to eggs to, I mean, just huge,"
124,00:06:09.97,00:06:09.97,and it's just always a set price.
125,00:06:11.40,00:06:11.40,"I mean, you get a lot of food for your money."
126,00:06:15.00,00:06:15.00,"- Frank knows a lot of things, and I can't believe he's never"
127,00:06:17.63,00:06:17.63,heard the term brunch before.
128,00:06:19.37,00:06:19.37,- It's a combination breakfast-lunch?
129,00:06:20.83,00:06:20.83,- Yes.
130,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,- And it's served when?
131,00:06:23.60,00:06:23.60,"- Frank is a three meals a day man,"
132,00:06:25.30,00:06:25.30,probably eats at the same time every day.
133,00:06:27.50,00:06:27.50,"Very, very regimented."
134,00:06:31.30,00:06:31.30,"- Frank, you want any more mush?"
135,00:06:33.50,00:06:33.50,"I mean, excuse me, brunch?"
136,00:06:34.73,00:06:34.73,"- No, thank you."
137,00:06:36.53,00:06:36.53,(flies buzzing)
138,00:06:40.50,00:06:40.50,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
139,00:06:46.30,00:06:46.30,- Things just look really good.
140,00:06:49.20,00:06:49.20,The only variable at this point
141,00:06:50.70,00:06:50.70,that will have anything to do
142,00:06:52.53,00:06:52.53,with us not making it to the final four
143,00:06:54.73,00:06:54.73,is just immunity challenges.
144,00:06:56.90,00:06:56.90,"Other than that, we're pretty much locked and loaded."
145,00:07:01.30,00:07:01.30,It just looks really good.
146,00:07:03.67,00:07:03.67,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
147,00:07:13.67,00:07:13.67,- I don't want to be with the team anymore.
148,00:07:15.83,00:07:15.83,I just don't want it.
149,00:07:17.43,00:07:17.43,It is absolutely horrible.
150,00:07:19.73,00:07:19.73,This is horrible.
151,00:07:23.57,00:07:23.57,I want to do the merge and start having individual competitions.
152,00:07:27.97,00:07:27.97,It's everybody for themselves.
153,00:07:34.23,00:07:34.23,- I'm stoked.
154,00:07:35.80,00:07:35.80,I think this is gonna be-- it's gonna be a whole new game.
155,00:07:38.07,00:07:38.07,It's going to be fun.
156,00:07:39.17,00:07:39.17,- We should merge today.
157,00:07:41.23,00:07:41.23,"- I hope so. - We may, we may not."
158,00:07:43.27,00:07:43.27,- We don't know at this point if there's going to be a merger
159,00:07:44.93,00:07:44.93,or when it's going to occur.
160,00:07:46.70,00:07:46.70,So we've kind of spent quite a bit of time just waiting for
161,00:07:49.20,00:07:49.20,something to happen that may not even happen.
162,00:08:00.20,00:08:00.20,You know what?
163,00:08:01.20,00:08:01.20,"I'm making you a little present, Big Tom."
164,00:08:03.60,00:08:03.60,You know what I'm calling it?
165,00:08:06.60,00:08:06.60,Uber spoon.
166,00:08:08.37,00:08:08.37,"You know what ""uber"" means?"
167,00:08:10.93,00:08:10.93,The ultimate. - Awesome.
168,00:08:12.97,00:08:12.97,- You're not going to believe it.
169,00:08:14.87,00:08:14.87,'Cause it is made-- I found a piece of wood.
170,00:08:16.67,00:08:16.67,It is ergonomically and... functionally perfect.
171,00:08:23.33,00:08:23.33,"- Oh, wow."
172,00:08:24.43,00:08:24.43,- And then I'm making...
173,00:08:26.23,00:08:26.23,This is the big Tom Buchannon spoon.
174,00:08:28.50,00:08:28.50,"- Lex is so politicking for a win, and that's fine."
175,00:08:32.33,00:08:32.33,But just watching him make spoons for Tom
176,00:08:35.27,00:08:35.27,"and kiss ass to everybody,"
177,00:08:36.77,00:08:36.77,"and talk in his ""dad"" voice, annoys me."
178,00:08:39.83,00:08:39.83,- Uber.
179,00:08:42.03,00:08:42.03,"- Oh, my gosh."
180,00:08:43.40,00:08:43.40,- It's got a brand name.
181,00:08:45.20,00:08:45.20,- Am I the only one who notices he's a totally weird person?
182,00:08:47.10,00:08:47.10,It's annoying.
183,00:08:48.40,00:08:48.40,I would like to vote off Lex in a perfect world.
184,00:08:50.30,00:08:50.30,"If I thought there was going to be no merger, ever,"
185,00:08:52.80,00:08:52.80,then I would do it in a heartbeat.
186,00:08:54.87,00:08:54.87,"- You know, I'm stoked enough about this spoon."
187,00:08:56.67,00:08:56.67,I think I may end up bringing it home with me.
188,00:08:58.77,00:08:58.77,- That's great.
189,00:09:01.00,00:09:01.00,- Whoo-whoo.
190,00:09:16.07,00:09:16.07,"- Yo, yo, everybody wake up."
191,00:09:17.70,00:09:17.70,Wake up! Wake up!
192,00:09:18.87,00:09:18.87,"Yo, we got mail."
193,00:09:20.57,00:09:20.57,"(whistling) Wake up, we got mail."
194,00:09:23.57,00:09:23.57,It is big and it is nasty.
195,00:09:25.40,00:09:25.40,"- Oh, Lord."
196,00:09:26.60,00:09:26.60,- Everybody ready here?
197,00:09:27.60,00:09:27.60,It's an immunity challenge.
198,00:09:28.87,00:09:28.87,We got 20 minutes to eat and get out of here if we want.
199,00:09:32.77,00:09:32.77,"- Oh, I'm anxious."
200,00:09:35.00,00:09:35.00,- Ready?
201,00:09:36.00,00:09:36.00,"- Anxious, yes."
202,00:09:37.27,00:09:37.27,"- Oh, my."
203,00:09:38.30,00:09:38.30,- What's that?
204,00:09:39.73,00:09:39.73,Oh.
205,00:09:40.73,00:09:40.73,- That's weird.
206,00:09:43.30,00:09:43.30,"Okay. ""Raise your hand if you know how to do it."""
207,00:09:49.23,00:09:49.23,"- ""You'll need lots of patience to make it through it."
208,00:09:52.30,00:09:52.30,"The weight on your head lasts as long as your power."""
209,00:09:55.67,00:09:55.67,"- ""If you let your arm drop, it may be your last shower."""
210,00:10:01.67,00:10:01.67,- That's something nasty.
211,00:10:02.87,00:10:02.87,So we're going to be holding something up.
212,00:10:04.67,00:10:04.67,- Your last shower or your last hour?
213,00:10:06.43,00:10:06.43,- Your last shower.
214,00:10:07.83,00:10:07.83,"- When we got mail, it was written in such a way that"
215,00:10:10.23,00:10:10.23,"some of us thought, ""Is it an individual"
216,00:10:13.23,00:10:13.23,"immunity challenge or a tribal?"""
217,00:10:15.03,00:10:15.03,Your last shower.
218,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,A team wouldn't take a shower together.
219,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,It'd be more or less an individual shower.
220,00:10:20.20,00:10:20.20,"- Based on the clues, what do-- do you think it's a reward?"
221,00:10:22.00,00:10:22.00,Do you think it's immunity? - Immunity.
222,00:10:23.30,00:10:23.30,It'll be your last shower. - Be your last shower.
223,00:10:25.10,00:10:25.10,- Ohh... - That's good-bye.
224,00:10:27.27,00:10:27.27,- We could figure out that we would have to hold something
225,00:10:29.27,00:10:29.27,on our head for a long period of time.
226,00:10:31.27,00:10:31.27,But we had no idea what was going on with--
227,00:10:33.20,00:10:33.20,"And any, just kind of given up on guessing anymore."
228,00:10:48.03,00:10:48.03,"- Morning, guys."
229,00:10:49.03,00:10:49.03,- Morning.
230,00:10:50.03,00:10:50.03,"- First things first, as always."
231,00:10:57.23,00:10:57.23,The ten of you have now merged into one tribe.
232,00:10:59.43,00:10:59.43,- Whoo!
233,00:11:02.47,00:11:02.47,- Congratulations.
234,00:11:03.90,00:11:03.90,"- And for the moment, you are without name."
235,00:11:05.83,00:11:05.83,You'll deal with that later.
236,00:11:07.17,00:11:07.17,"I do, however, have your new colors."
237,00:11:09.87,00:11:09.87,- Clarence.
238,00:11:11.50,00:11:11.50,"- My favorite color, green."
239,00:11:13.63,00:11:13.63,I like green.
240,00:11:14.90,00:11:14.90,"- Now since you guys are just one tribe,"
241,00:11:17.27,00:11:17.27,you obviously only need one camp to live in.
242,00:11:19.87,00:11:19.87,"If you had your choice, which camp would you like to live in?"
243,00:11:23.10,00:11:23.10,- Boran. - Boran.
244,00:11:24.57,00:11:24.57,- Boran sounds good.
245,00:11:26.27,00:11:26.27,"When this challenge is over, you'll head back to Boran."
246,00:11:28.90,00:11:28.90,Your personal items from Samburu will be waiting there for you.
247,00:11:31.83,00:11:31.83,"Because you are one tribe, team immunity is gone."
248,00:11:36.70,00:11:36.70,Individual immunity is what's at stake.
249,00:11:38.13,00:11:38.13,"- Oh, a necklace."
250,00:11:39.73,00:11:39.73,"- Wear this, you cannot be voted out at Tribal Council."
251,00:11:43.00,00:11:43.00,Now to today's challenge.
252,00:11:44.57,00:11:44.57,"It's going to require a lot of endurance,"
253,00:11:46.57,00:11:46.57,and a strong threshold of pain.
254,00:11:49.13,00:11:49.13,You're gonna step up on a log.
255,00:11:50.93,00:11:50.93,One arm will be raised.
256,00:11:52.50,00:11:52.50,"That arm is connected to a rope, which is connected to a bucket,"
257,00:11:55.40,00:11:55.40,which is full of water.
258,00:11:56.93,00:11:56.93,"The slightest movement brings the bucket over,"
259,00:11:58.90,00:11:58.90,you're out of the challenge.
260,00:12:00.70,00:12:00.70,Last person standing wins immunity.
261,00:12:03.27,00:12:03.27,"Pick a spot, let's do it."
262,00:12:06.33,00:12:06.33,Survivors ready?
263,00:12:07.33,00:12:07.33,And begin.
264,00:12:30.43,00:12:30.43,"- Feeling anything, Kim?"
265,00:12:31.83,00:12:31.83,Back starting to get to you a little?
266,00:12:33.50,00:12:33.50,- Little bit. - Little bit?
267,00:12:34.60,00:12:34.60,- Mm-hmm. - All right.
268,00:12:35.80,00:12:35.80,"Well, we're 10 minutes in,"
269,00:12:36.83,00:12:36.83,so I figure it'll go several hours.
270,00:12:38.37,00:12:38.37,How about you? - I love doing this.
271,00:12:39.90,00:12:39.90,I do this at home.
272,00:12:41.17,00:12:41.17,- So you like that little tingly sort of thing?
273,00:12:42.47,00:12:42.47,"- Mmm, it's great. - Starts going numb?"
274,00:12:43.67,00:12:43.67,"- You don't get this enough in life, I find."
275,00:12:44.83,00:12:44.83,"- Well, good, all right."
276,00:12:46.23,00:12:46.23,I'll see you guys in a little bit.
277,00:13:00.37,00:13:00.37,- Agh!
278,00:13:01.37,00:13:01.37,"- Kelly, benches."
279,00:13:02.90,00:13:02.90,You can sit and relax.
280,00:13:05.90,00:13:05.90,- (gasps)
281,00:13:15.73,00:13:15.73,- Can you see any buckets wavering at all?
282,00:13:17.73,00:13:17.73,- None.
283,00:13:18.73,00:13:18.73,The buckets are solid.
284,00:13:20.40,00:13:20.40,(whispering) So how were things over there?
285,00:13:22.23,00:13:22.23,"- You know, they gave us a lot of information,"
286,00:13:23.57,00:13:23.57,like when you-- - Obviously.
287,00:13:24.77,00:13:24.77,I couldn't believe that.
288,00:13:25.97,00:13:25.97,"- No, I know, but we did by far the right thing."
289,00:13:27.67,00:13:27.67,- Mm-hmm.
290,00:13:28.67,00:13:28.67,"No, I'm glad he's gone."
291,00:13:30.10,00:13:30.10,I'm ecstatic.
292,00:13:31.10,00:13:31.10,I was so happy.
293,00:13:32.57,00:13:32.57,"Frank kind of seems like a jackass, but the kids on here"
294,00:13:34.70,00:13:34.70,really don't want Frank on the jury.
295,00:13:36.37,00:13:36.37,"Frank hates women and doesn't want a woman to win, by the way."
296,00:13:38.77,00:13:38.77,So I don't think we want him on the jury.
297,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,- Okay.
298,00:13:43.53,00:13:43.53,"- Oh, screw it."
299,00:13:46.40,00:13:46.40,"Whoo! - How's that feel, B?"
300,00:13:49.63,00:13:49.63,"- Oh! Well, I can't feel one whole side of my body,"
301,00:13:52.30,00:13:52.30,but that's cool.
302,00:13:54.80,00:13:54.80,- (gasps)
303,00:14:01.80,00:14:01.80,- Oh!
304,00:14:03.43,00:14:03.43,"- (groans) - All right, Big T."
305,00:14:05.23,00:14:05.23,"- Good job, Big Tom!"
306,00:14:06.93,00:14:06.93,"- All right, way to go."
307,00:14:08.23,00:14:08.23,"- Look at Frank looking at his. - Come on, Frank."
308,00:14:11.43,00:14:11.43,- I can't believe his bucket isn't that more sensitive.
309,00:14:13.53,00:14:13.53,"- Come on, Frank. Dummy."
310,00:14:16.03,00:14:16.03,"- Frank and Ethan, their arms seem to be really tired."
311,00:14:19.00,00:14:19.00,"And, like, Frank's just moving all over the place."
312,00:14:20.70,00:14:20.70,And here it goes.
313,00:14:24.00,00:14:24.00,"Yeah. Oh, good job, Frank."
314,00:14:26.30,00:14:26.30,"- Good job, Frank."
315,00:14:27.33,00:14:27.33,- Good job! Way to tough it out.
316,00:14:43.10,00:14:43.10,- Ethan's starting to hurt.
317,00:14:44.53,00:14:44.53,He's showing pain too bad.
318,00:14:46.17,00:14:46.17,- Clarence is close. He's close.
319,00:14:49.00,00:14:49.00,\xe2\x99\xaa The sun'll come out tomorrow \xe2\x99\xaa
320,00:14:53.40,00:14:53.40,Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow... \xe2\x99\xaa
321,00:14:58.23,00:14:58.23,"- What's she singing? - She's singing ""Tomorrow."""
322,00:14:59.60,00:14:59.60,- From Annie?  - Uh-huh.
323,00:15:01.37,00:15:01.37,"- \xe2\x99\xaa Tomorrow, tomorrow \xe2\x99\xaa"
324,00:15:04.27,00:15:04.27,"\xe2\x99\xaa I love ya, tomorrow \xe2\x99\xaa"
325,00:15:07.03,00:15:07.03,\xe2\x99\xaa You're only a day \xe2\x99\xaa
326,00:15:10.47,00:15:10.47,\xe2\x99\xaa Away \xe2\x99\xaa
327,00:15:14.83,00:15:14.83,(cheers and applause)
328,00:15:16.67,00:15:16.67,"- All right, T-bird."
329,00:15:18.93,00:15:18.93,- So talented.
330,00:15:30.97,00:15:30.97,"- Well, guys, it wouldn't be Survivor without..."
331,00:15:33.23,00:15:33.23,"- Oh, no, hell no. Come on, man."
332,00:15:35.30,00:15:35.30,- ... a little temptation. - (chuckling)
333,00:15:37.77,00:15:37.77,"- Fresh off the grill, all-American cheeseburger."
334,00:15:40.90,00:15:40.90,"It's got onion, mayonnaise, tomato, mustard, ketchup,"
335,00:15:45.20,00:15:45.20,"lettuce, cheese, and a lot of beef."
336,00:15:48.57,00:15:48.57,"- Oh, my God."
337,00:15:49.83,00:15:49.83,- Somebody's gone.
338,00:15:50.87,00:15:50.87,- Ethan's gone.
339,00:15:51.90,00:15:51.90,"- Teresa. - No, no, Lex. Lex."
340,00:15:55.13,00:15:55.13,- It's a pretty simple deal.
341,00:15:56.53,00:15:56.53,"If immunity is not that important, you feel safe,"
342,00:15:59.67,00:15:59.67,"come on down, have yourself a meal."
343,00:16:01.47,00:16:01.47,- Look at them all looking.
344,00:16:02.50,00:16:02.50,- (laughing) Oh.
345,00:16:03.77,00:16:03.77,"- Take it, Lex."
346,00:16:04.83,00:16:04.83,- This will appeal to Clarence.
347,00:16:05.83,00:16:05.83,- I don't blame her.
348,00:16:06.83,00:16:06.83,- Clarence?
349,00:16:08.43,00:16:08.43,"That'll remind you of home, come on, come on."
350,00:16:10.73,00:16:10.73,That's a burger.
351,00:16:11.77,00:16:11.77,"- Bring it over here, let me test it!"
352,00:16:13.90,00:16:13.90,(laughter)
353,00:16:15.23,00:16:15.23,"- Don't do it, Clarence. Hang tough!"
354,00:16:17.30,00:16:17.30,- Nobody interested? - We're interested.
355,00:16:20.13,00:16:20.13,"- All right, well, I'll just give it to these guys, then."
356,00:16:22.30,00:16:22.30,(all cheering)
357,00:16:24.30,00:16:24.30,- You're welcome.
358,00:16:26.30,00:16:26.30,- Uh-uh-uh-uh.
359,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,"- Oh, my God!"
360,00:16:29.83,00:16:29.83,"- Hey, Tom..."
361,00:16:31.40,00:16:31.40,"- Oh, my God!"
362,00:16:32.40,00:16:32.40,"- Hey, you guys eat quietly! - Okay."
363,00:16:34.73,00:16:34.73,"- Sorry, we're very sorry."
364,00:16:35.93,00:16:35.93,- It's a little bit cold.
365,00:16:42.50,00:16:42.50,- That was so good.
366,00:16:47.27,00:16:47.27,(crickets chirping)
367,00:16:54.67,00:16:54.67,- Would you go for a whole pizza?
368,00:16:56.57,00:16:56.57,- Yeah.
369,00:16:57.67,00:16:57.67,"- You would? No, you wouldn't."
370,00:16:58.80,00:16:58.80,"- 100%, guarantee you."
371,00:17:00.17,00:17:00.17,- No way.
372,00:17:01.17,00:17:01.17,- Guarantee you.
373,00:17:06.17,00:17:06.17,- Next on the menu.
374,00:17:07.73,00:17:07.73,It's got a crust.
375,00:17:10.37,00:17:10.37,It's got cheese.
376,00:17:13.03,00:17:13.03,It's cut into four slices.
377,00:17:14.87,00:17:14.87,And it is very hot.
378,00:17:16.93,00:17:16.93,Look at that.
379,00:17:18.00,00:17:18.00,Mmm. Mmm.
380,00:17:19.63,00:17:19.63,Tell me this is tempting somebody.
381,00:17:22.43,00:17:22.43,- Ooh.
382,00:17:23.63,00:17:23.63,- If Clarence lets go and takes that pizza
383,00:17:24.97,00:17:24.97,"and sits here and eats the whole thing himself,"
384,00:17:26.23,00:17:26.23,"which he would, I'll kill him myself."
385,00:17:28.63,00:17:28.63,- Which he would.
386,00:17:29.63,00:17:29.63,- I'll kill him myself.
387,00:17:32.70,00:17:32.70,- Clarence?
388,00:17:33.70,00:17:33.70,Get out of here?
389,00:17:34.70,00:17:34.70,- Peace.
390,00:17:35.70,00:17:35.70,- Peace out! All right.
391,00:17:36.97,00:17:36.97,- Whoo!
392,00:17:38.07,00:17:38.07,"- Oh, my God."
393,00:17:42.23,00:17:42.23,"- You guys, it's not even finished cooking yet."
394,00:17:44.33,00:17:44.33,You're lucky.
395,00:17:45.43,00:17:45.43,It's all doughy.
396,00:17:55.23,00:17:55.23,(all groan)
397,00:17:56.43,00:17:56.43,"- Good job, Lex."
398,00:17:57.47,00:17:57.47,Really good job.
399,00:17:59.80,00:17:59.80,"- Lex, you missed out on all that food by minutes."
400,00:18:02.77,00:18:02.77,- Don't remind me.
401,00:18:05.13,00:18:05.13,- I'd actually like to see it come down to Ethan and Clarence
402,00:18:07.10,00:18:07.10,and see what happens.
403,00:18:08.57,00:18:08.57,- I don't want to see Clarence wearing that damn necklace.
404,00:18:10.77,00:18:10.77,"That's just gonna piss me off. - Oh, I know."
405,00:18:16.57,00:18:16.57,- No!
406,00:18:19.50,00:18:19.50,"- Ohh, Ethan."
407,00:18:21.93,00:18:21.93,Good job. You did a great job.

409,00:18:37.37,00:18:37.37,- (whistles) Let's compromise.
410,00:18:39.83,00:18:39.83,"Rock, paper, scissors."
411,00:18:41.37,00:18:41.37,"- Clarence, I have too much to lose."
412,00:18:43.03,00:18:43.03,There's too many of you here.
413,00:18:45.13,00:18:45.13,- I don't think it'll be you.
414,00:18:46.40,00:18:46.40,- Huh?
415,00:18:47.40,00:18:47.40,- It won't be you.
416,00:18:51.50,00:18:51.50,- Guys...
417,00:18:53.07,00:18:53.07,"That's chicken, salad, corn on the cob, rice, cold beer,"
418,00:18:57.67,00:18:57.67,"Mountain Dew, big glass of ice."
419,00:19:01.30,00:19:01.30,Same deal as last time.
420,00:19:02.30,00:19:02.30,"Step down, it's yours."
421,00:19:04.90,00:19:04.90,- Don't get bribed down.
422,00:19:06.30,00:19:06.30,"- Close your eyes, y'all."
423,00:19:07.37,00:19:07.37,- Don't look at it.
424,00:19:12.10,00:19:12.10,- You're stronger than me.
425,00:19:13.93,00:19:13.93,You can win more immunity challenges than me.
426,00:19:17.10,00:19:17.10,"- (sighs) They want me gone, too,"
427,00:19:22.03,00:19:22.03,because I'm strong.
428,00:19:25.27,00:19:25.27,- You made that up.
429,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,"You're trying to trick me, and I don't like it."
430,00:19:31.40,00:19:31.40,- He's working hard up there.
431,00:19:33.03,00:19:33.03,You see him?
432,00:19:34.03,00:19:34.03,He's trying to make a deal.
433,00:19:36.53,00:19:36.53,"- Hey, there's also strength in alliances."
434,00:19:38.43,00:19:38.43,- What?
435,00:19:39.53,00:19:39.53,- There's also strength in alliances.
436,00:19:42.80,00:19:42.80,I'm not Silas. You've got to trust me.
437,00:19:45.20,00:19:45.20,- Do you trust me?
438,00:19:46.63,00:19:46.63,- Do you trust me?
439,00:19:50.03,00:19:50.03,(crow cawing)
440,00:19:56.83,00:19:56.83,- Clarence is starting to break down.
441,00:19:58.63,00:19:58.63,"I think he's trying to bait her down, either by offering her"
442,00:20:01.50,00:20:01.50,"a deal that, you know,"
443,00:20:03.07,00:20:03.07,people are not going to vote her off.
444,00:20:04.60,00:20:04.60,"He keeps looking over to us, asking us for some kind of"
445,00:20:06.97,00:20:06.97,assurance that we won't.
446,00:20:08.40,00:20:08.40,"I don't know why he's asking us for anything, though."
447,00:20:11.13,00:20:11.13,"You know, when you're up there, it's just about you."
448,00:20:20.23,00:20:20.23,- They can't even tell what I'm talking about.
449,00:20:35.47,00:20:35.47,T... T...
450,00:20:37.83,00:20:37.83,"Rock, paper, scissors."

458,00:21:06.80,00:21:06.80,Clarence gets the food.
459,00:21:08.67,00:21:08.67,"You, my dear, get this."
460,00:21:10.80,00:21:10.80,- Thank you. - Congratulations.
461,00:21:15.13,00:21:15.13,Big day for you guys.
462,00:21:16.33,00:21:16.33,Two tribes became one.
463,00:21:18.27,00:21:18.27,"Tonight you'll have a new name, and tomorrow night,"
464,00:21:20.07,00:21:20.07,"Tribal Council, where only one of you is absolutely safe."
465,00:21:24.37,00:21:24.37,You guys can head back to camp.
466,00:21:25.97,00:21:25.97,I'll see you tomorrow.
467,00:21:37.03,00:21:37.03,- Somebody else better lead the way.
468,00:21:38.10,00:21:38.10,"- Welcome home, guys, welcome home."
469,00:21:40.33,00:21:40.33,- Thank you.
470,00:21:41.90,00:21:41.90,"Show me which mountain we climbed, the three of us."
471,00:21:43.80,00:21:43.80,"- Right there. - That's it, the big one."
472,00:21:45.50,00:21:45.50,See the ridge we climbed?
473,00:21:46.93,00:21:46.93,"- I just shifted my weight just slightly,"
474,00:21:48.10,00:21:48.10,"water sloshed, and it was down."
475,00:21:50.20,00:21:50.20,'Cause I still felt so strong.
476,00:21:52.13,00:21:52.13,"- I didn't want the sandwich, I couldn't eat."
477,00:21:54.60,00:21:54.60,- Why? - Well...
478,00:21:57.27,00:21:57.27,- The whole tribe was together for the first time and able
479,00:22:00.43,00:22:00.43,to talk and imagine getting in the mail
480,00:22:03.57,00:22:03.57,"an invitation to attend a Wagner family reunion,"
481,00:22:07.30,00:22:07.30,and your last name is Smith.
482,00:22:10.20,00:22:10.20,That's just what it felt like.
483,00:22:12.90,00:22:12.90,"I'm just floating on the outside kind of right now,"
484,00:22:14.97,00:22:14.97,looking at things.
485,00:22:17.40,00:22:17.40,(overlapping chatter) - Make it shorter.
486,00:22:20.27,00:22:20.27,"- Oh, my gosh, they brought the cart!"
487,00:22:22.50,00:22:22.50,- Nice.
488,00:22:24.53,00:22:24.53,"Oh, it feels like home."
489,00:22:25.53,00:22:25.53,"- Welcome, you guys. Welcome."
490,00:22:27.40,00:22:27.40,"- Oh, my gosh, you guys, we got some stuff!"
491,00:22:29.73,00:22:29.73,"- Oh, gosh."
492,00:22:30.73,00:22:30.73,- This is really exciting.
493,00:22:32.13,00:22:32.13,We have a little note.
494,00:22:33.37,00:22:33.37,"Come on! - Hey, Big Tom."
495,00:22:35.07,00:22:35.07,- Whoa! - Come on!

499,00:22:42.27,00:22:42.27,"""Make a new flag. Decide on a name."
500,00:22:44.57,00:22:44.57,"""One that you'll keep for the rest of the game."
501,00:22:46.53,00:22:46.53,"""Reach into the basket to give your spirits a lift"
502,00:22:49.03,00:22:49.03,"with this housewarming gift."""
503,00:22:50.83,00:22:50.83,- Whoo!
504,00:22:53.17,00:22:53.17,(all screaming excitedly)
505,00:22:58.37,00:22:58.37,"- Oh, my God!"
506,00:23:01.63,00:23:01.63,"- We have to eat this soon, though, 'cause this will go bad."
507,00:23:04.43,00:23:04.43,"- Wow. - You know, let's celebrate."
508,00:23:06.57,00:23:06.57,Let's celebrate with this.
509,00:23:07.80,00:23:07.80,- Yay!
510,00:23:09.93,00:23:09.93,- I haven't eaten in 24 hours. I'm so hungry.
511,00:23:11.20,00:23:11.20,"- Oh, Lex."
512,00:23:12.57,00:23:12.57,"- This is so great, this is awesome."
513,00:23:14.20,00:23:14.20,- Come get prime real estate. - Pick a spot.
514,00:23:16.20,00:23:16.20,Any old spot will do.
515,00:23:17.63,00:23:17.63,We'll pass the jug of wine around.
516,00:23:19.63,00:23:19.63,We have reason to celebrate.
517,00:23:22.80,00:23:22.80,- Everybody was happy.
518,00:23:24.10,00:23:24.10,Everybody was ready to partake in the feast.
519,00:23:26.70,00:23:26.70,"Well, you can only have so many preparers for that."
520,00:23:29.43,00:23:29.43,We were all standing around and I just didn't want to stand
521,00:23:31.93,00:23:31.93,"around, you know, I just..."
522,00:23:33.33,00:23:33.33,So I just went outside the manyata
523,00:23:34.87,00:23:34.87,"and started gathering wood, because we need wood."
524,00:23:37.63,00:23:37.63,- How's it taste?
525,00:23:38.63,00:23:38.63,- Mm-hmm.
526,00:23:40.13,00:23:40.13,Tastes great.
527,00:23:41.13,00:23:41.13,- T-Bird.
528,00:23:42.27,00:23:42.27,"You earned that, baby."
529,00:23:43.30,00:23:43.30,You earned that. - Sure did.
530,00:23:44.70,00:23:44.70,- I know.
531,00:23:45.70,00:23:45.70,(laughter)
532,00:23:47.27,00:23:47.27,(indistinct chatter)
533,00:23:50.30,00:23:50.30,"- I'm sorry, man."
534,00:23:52.23,00:23:52.23,I'm sorry.
535,00:23:53.33,00:23:53.33,- All right.
536,00:23:54.33,00:23:54.33,"- Come on, Frank."
537,00:23:57.73,00:23:57.73,Frank is a very big loner.
538,00:23:59.73,00:23:59.73,He socially seems so inept.
539,00:24:02.73,00:24:02.73,"I mean, I guess probably a large section of the population"
540,00:24:04.63,00:24:04.63,"is introverted and antisocial, and that's fine,"
541,00:24:07.23,00:24:07.23,but I feel like there are prescription drugs
542,00:24:08.77,00:24:08.77,"to counteract that, and he should maybe be on them."
543,00:24:10.67,00:24:10.67,(laughter and chatter)
544,00:24:17.83,00:24:17.83,- Here's to my new ten friends.
545,00:24:19.60,00:24:19.60,- Aww.
546,00:24:20.90,00:24:20.90,- That I'm excited to spend the next adventure with.
547,00:24:24.13,00:24:24.13,- Nice. - Yay.
548,00:24:25.73,00:24:25.73,- You could almost tell Teresa is a good woman.
549,00:24:28.40,00:24:28.40,It's hard not to see just an old Georgia Baptist
550,00:24:31.07,00:24:31.07,good ol' girl in there.
551,00:24:32.27,00:24:32.27,"And, uh, she sure ain't bad to look at."
552,00:24:34.80,00:24:34.80,(whistles) My wife knows I'm just a man.
553,00:24:37.67,00:24:37.67,"Hell, I'm out here in the bush, and after looking at Brandon"
554,00:24:41.07,00:24:41.07,"for seven days, I don't care if Teresa"
555,00:24:43.77,00:24:43.77,"had one eye on her forehead, I'd still take her."
556,00:24:46.73,00:24:46.73,(howls)
557,00:24:47.87,00:24:47.87,- You were doing it right next to me!
558,00:24:50.50,00:24:50.50,- Leave it to that pervert.
559,00:24:51.77,00:24:51.77,I didn't do it.
560,00:24:52.77,00:24:52.77,(laughter)
561,00:24:56.20,00:24:56.20,"- Yes, ma'am."
562,00:24:57.47,00:24:57.47,- Here you go. - Thank you.
563,00:24:59.47,00:24:59.47,- So let's think up a drinking game.
564,00:25:01.03,00:25:01.03,- Something you have to-- like truth or dare.
565,00:25:03.10,00:25:03.10,- I think we should tell something very personal
566,00:25:04.47,00:25:04.47,about ourselves so that we get to know each other.
567,00:25:05.90,00:25:05.90,'Cause we don't really know each other.
568,00:25:07.37,00:25:07.37,"- It's like, ""I never."" - ""I never."""
569,00:25:09.80,00:25:09.80,"- We played this game, um, ""I never,"""
570,00:25:11.80,00:25:11.80,"which is, like, you're supposed to, like,"
571,00:25:13.10,00:25:13.10,tell dirty stories and whatever.
572,00:25:15.10,00:25:15.10,- I've never walked in a crowd naked.
573,00:25:19.17,00:25:19.17,- Does thongs count?
574,00:25:20.30,00:25:20.30,- I was about to ask about underwear.
575,00:25:22.53,00:25:22.53,- I have been turned on by a 56-year-old woman.
576,00:25:25.93,00:25:25.93,- Ohh! - Whoo!
577,00:25:27.97,00:25:27.97,- How naughty.
578,00:25:29.30,00:25:29.30,(raucous laughter)
579,00:25:30.33,00:25:30.33,- Come on. - So all those--
580,00:25:32.80,00:25:32.80,- I've never had sex in an airplane.
581,00:25:34.97,00:25:34.97,- I have.
582,00:25:35.97,00:25:35.97,(all exclaim)
583,00:25:39.07,00:25:39.07,"- Tom... - Uh-oh, look out."
584,00:25:40.73,00:25:40.73,- Tom's ready to change his sleeping arrangement.
585,00:25:43.10,00:25:43.10,- I'm supposed to say something I've never done?
586,00:25:45.50,00:25:45.50,- Right. - And it's the truth.
587,00:25:47.60,00:25:47.60,"- Right, the truth."
588,00:25:49.27,00:25:49.27,You've literally never done it.
589,00:25:50.90,00:25:50.90,- I've never broken the honor of a handshake.
590,00:25:53.20,00:25:53.20,It's just a golden rule I was brought up on.
591,00:25:55.20,00:25:55.20,"- No, I like it."
592,00:25:56.83,00:25:56.83,I'm very respectful of that. That's great.
593,00:25:58.23,00:25:58.23,"- Even I enjoyed it, it was good just to relax"
594,00:26:00.57,00:26:00.57,for a little bit.
595,00:26:01.87,00:26:01.87,It was fun.
596,00:26:03.13,00:26:03.13,"But I wanted to get it over with, though, too."
597,00:26:04.80,00:26:04.80,"Well, it's still daylight. We got time to go get wood."
598,00:26:06.83,00:26:06.83,- Let's get wood. - Let's get wood.
599,00:26:08.73,00:26:08.73,- I needed a little booze in my system.
600,00:26:09.90,00:26:09.90,- I might even start break-dancing.
601,00:26:11.27,00:26:11.27,- This is nice.
602,00:26:15.33,00:26:15.33,- Take out the dead arm.
603,00:26:17.70,00:26:17.70,- (laughs)
604,00:26:19.03,00:26:19.03,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
605,00:26:37.73,00:26:37.73,- Look at the elephant. - Behind you.
606,00:26:39.73,00:26:39.73,- Frank! See the elephant?
607,00:26:43.77,00:26:43.77,- He's coming this way.
608,00:26:45.03,00:26:45.03,Give this guy room.
609,00:26:47.37,00:26:47.37,"He knows he's got plenty of room to the right if he wants,"
610,00:26:49.73,00:26:49.73,he wants to just...
611,00:26:51.07,00:26:51.07,There he goes.
612,00:26:52.07,00:26:52.07,He's going to turn.
613,00:26:55.93,00:26:55.93,He's taking a second guess.
614,00:26:59.43,00:26:59.43,"Taking a little dump, looking around."
615,00:27:03.17,00:27:03.17,"I'm downwind from him, so he doesn't have a good smell."
616,00:27:11.00,00:27:11.00,He's stepping to the right.
617,00:27:12.93,00:27:12.93,He just...
618,00:27:24.30,00:27:24.30,- There was a big bull elephant right next to our camp.
619,00:27:27.87,00:27:27.87,"Frank, he was making an elephant motion and I don't know..."
620,00:27:32.07,00:27:32.07,(imitates elephant)
621,00:27:33.57,00:27:33.57,"I really don't know what he was doing,"
622,00:27:35.20,00:27:35.20,but he was messing with that elephant.
623,00:27:38.60,00:27:38.60,"- I'm just imitating him, that's all."
624,00:27:40.60,00:27:40.60,Just seeing if he relaxes.
625,00:27:43.03,00:27:43.03,"I'm sure by an elephant's eyesight, he's not exactly sure"
626,00:27:45.67,00:27:45.67,what I am.
627,00:27:47.10,00:27:47.10,"So maybe whatever visual he has,"
628,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,"he just sees a gentle tail sway, a loping."
629,00:28:06.53,00:28:06.53,The elephant just seemed to be swaying and wagging his tail and
630,00:28:10.40,00:28:10.40,"looking over, and..."
631,00:28:11.83,00:28:11.83,I just wanted to experiment a little animal behavior
632,00:28:14.67,00:28:14.67,and just hang out there with him and just
633,00:28:16.17,00:28:16.17,sway back and forth and swinging my canteen
634,00:28:18.23,00:28:18.23,behind me like a tail.
635,00:28:21.47,00:28:21.47,"I don't know, at times it seemed like he might have acknowledged,"
636,00:28:23.67,00:28:23.67,"stopped and looked over, you know?"
637,00:28:26.67,00:28:26.67,There's a few humans here I wouldn't interact with.
638,00:28:29.57,00:28:29.57,"You know, but the animals, yes."
639,00:28:41.13,00:28:41.13,(indistinct chatter)
640,00:28:43.00,00:28:43.00,- We should have a tribe name ceremony.
641,00:28:45.37,00:28:45.37,- We ought to come up with our own name.
642,00:28:47.37,00:28:47.37,- With our own name. - Now that we're a family.
643,00:28:49.37,00:28:49.37,- Does anybody have strong preferences
644,00:28:50.60,00:28:50.60,one way or the other?
645,00:28:52.20,00:28:52.20,"- Maji is water, Moto is fire."
646,00:28:54.17,00:28:54.17,Maji Moto means hot water.
647,00:28:56.93,00:28:56.93,- Maji Moto? I like it.
648,00:28:58.40,00:28:58.40,- And we're always in hot water.
649,00:28:59.40,00:28:59.40,"I mean, there's a double meaning there."
650,00:29:01.63,00:29:01.63,"- We're kind of brainstorming about the name together,"
651,00:29:03.87,00:29:03.87,and somebody came up with the idea
652,00:29:05.53,00:29:05.53,of getting the Swahili definition for water and fire.
653,00:29:10.27,00:29:10.27,And so what we came up with it's Moto Maji
654,00:29:12.23,00:29:12.23,or something along those lines.
655,00:29:13.53,00:29:13.53,(overlapping chatter)
656,00:29:15.07,00:29:15.07,- Maji.
657,00:29:16.07,00:29:16.07,- Maji Moto?
658,00:29:17.07,00:29:17.07,- M-O-T-O?
659,00:29:18.37,00:29:18.37,- I like it.
660,00:29:19.93,00:29:19.93,I think it's something like Moto Java
661,00:29:22.43,00:29:22.43,or something like that.
662,00:29:23.50,00:29:23.50,- I like Maji Moto.
663,00:29:25.73,00:29:25.73,- I love it.
664,00:29:26.73,00:29:26.73,- It's Moto Maji.
665,00:29:28.30,00:29:28.30,Moto Magi?
666,00:29:29.90,00:29:29.90,Momo Magi? I don't know.
667,00:29:31.77,00:29:31.77,- Moto Maji?
668,00:29:32.90,00:29:32.90,- Moto Maji. - That sounds good.
669,00:29:34.57,00:29:34.57,- I really don't care about the name.
670,00:29:35.70,00:29:35.70,I think that's all kind of cornball anyway.
671,00:29:37.97,00:29:37.97,"I don't give a (blip) one way or the other, didn't care."
672,00:29:39.60,00:29:39.60,"They could have named it, you know, Theaters Anonymous,"
673,00:29:42.13,00:29:42.13,I could care less.
674,00:29:43.93,00:29:43.93,- A show of hands?
675,00:29:45.30,00:29:45.30,"First motion? Second, anyone?"
676,00:29:47.33,00:29:47.33,Maji Moto? - Maji Moto.
677,00:29:50.00,00:29:50.00,- Moto Maji. - Moto Maji.
678,00:30:07.43,00:30:07.43,"- 21 days, can you guys believe it?"
679,00:30:11.30,00:30:11.30,- This is a game.
680,00:30:12.83,00:30:12.83,But it's so much more than a game.
681,00:30:14.17,00:30:14.17,"I mean, we are thrust into a survival situation"
682,00:30:18.07,00:30:18.07,in a strange place.
683,00:30:19.43,00:30:19.43,"We're pulling together, creating a society."
684,00:30:24.10,00:30:24.10,"At this point, we're down to ten people."
685,00:30:27.20,00:30:27.20,We have a lot invested here.
686,00:30:31.03,00:30:31.03,"- I don't care who you are, $1 million changes your life."
687,00:30:33.63,00:30:33.63,So the fact of the matter is is that you have to be
688,00:30:36.13,00:30:36.13,"very aware now of who you say what to,"
689,00:30:38.83,00:30:38.83,"what you say, what comments you make about other people,"
690,00:30:41.53,00:30:41.53,"because these people are going to be on a jury,"
691,00:30:43.67,00:30:43.67,and they may discuss you amongst themselves.
692,00:30:45.90,00:30:45.90,And so now you have to be very careful.
693,00:30:48.03,00:30:48.03,"- Brandon, you're unusually quiet."
694,00:30:50.53,00:30:50.53,- I know. I'm...
695,00:30:53.17,00:30:53.17,I can listen better whenever I don't talk.
696,00:30:55.20,00:30:55.20,- Okay.
697,00:30:59.00,00:30:59.00,"- I have noticed whispering and conversations taking place,"
698,00:31:03.13,00:31:03.13,"whether they be the case that,"
699,00:31:04.63,00:31:04.63,"""Hey, let's bring Frank along for the ride,"""
700,00:31:06.83,00:31:06.83,"or, ""I think we'd better get rid of Frank,"""
701,00:31:09.67,00:31:09.67,I have no idea.
702,00:31:11.43,00:31:11.43,- What are we going to do?
703,00:31:13.30,00:31:13.30,- About what?
704,00:31:14.30,00:31:14.30,- The hatchet.
705,00:31:16.70,00:31:16.70,- About what?
706,00:31:17.70,00:31:17.70,- The hatchet.
707,00:31:18.70,00:31:18.70,The knife in the back.
708,00:31:19.70,00:31:19.70,Who are we going to slice?
709,00:31:32.27,00:31:32.27,"- The tribe Moto Maji is up and running,"
710,00:31:34.03,00:31:34.03,"and it starts with our flag,"
711,00:31:35.43,00:31:35.43,so I've got a big job ahead of me.
712,00:31:36.57,00:31:36.57,So... I've got to make sure I finish it.
713,00:31:42.27,00:31:42.27,"- Talk to you about the, um... - Yeah."
714,00:31:44.53,00:31:44.53,- About tonight. - Mm-hmm.
715,00:31:46.30,00:31:46.30,"- I don't know how you feel about this, but I may just"
716,00:31:48.47,00:31:48.47,tell him straight up what we're doing.
717,00:31:51.80,00:31:51.80,"- Well, I don't know, what are we doing?"
718,00:31:53.80,00:31:53.80,"- Well, I thought we were... - What I did--"
719,00:31:57.03,00:31:57.03,"- The one person that's going to be voted off at this point,"
720,00:31:59.43,00:31:59.43,I don't think has a clue about it.
721,00:32:00.87,00:32:00.87,(indistinct chatter)
722,00:32:02.80,00:32:02.80,- I got to get one of them water jugs.
723,00:32:05.37,00:32:05.37,"- So I've decided, I've taken it on myself,"
724,00:32:07.73,00:32:07.73,that I'll pull him aside and tell him
725,00:32:09.93,00:32:09.93,exactly what we're going to do.
726,00:32:12.00,00:32:12.00,I know he's not gonna like it.
727,00:32:13.00,00:32:13.00,I don't know how he's going to react.
728,00:32:18.37,00:32:18.37,- Today Lex came up with this scheme.
729,00:32:20.37,00:32:20.37,"Lex, the grandmaster, Lex, that for some reason people bow to."
730,00:32:22.67,00:32:22.67,I don't understand why.
731,00:32:23.93,00:32:23.93,- You and I have gotten close. - Yeah.
732,00:32:25.67,00:32:25.67,"- In this whole situation, you're a man, I'm a man."
733,00:32:28.57,00:32:28.57,And I can only deal with you man to man.
734,00:32:30.90,00:32:30.90,- I know.
735,00:32:32.07,00:32:32.07,- I didn't want to lie to you about anything.
736,00:32:33.37,00:32:33.37,"- Yeah, that's cool. - And I wanted to tell you,"
737,00:32:34.93,00:32:34.93,"just face to face, that we've all decided"
738,00:32:38.83,00:32:38.83,"to vote you off today, and..."
739,00:32:40.83,00:32:40.83,and I want you to understand.
740,00:32:42.97,00:32:42.97,"I mean, it sounds, it sounds cliche, but it's not personal."
741,00:32:45.83,00:32:45.83,- I know.
742,00:32:46.83,00:32:46.83,- And it's all about the game.
743,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,It's all about competition.
744,00:32:50.07,00:32:50.07,Now that we're realizing that individual immunity
745,00:32:52.60,00:32:52.60,is like everything... - Yeah.
746,00:32:55.23,00:32:55.23,- ... we can't have you winning all those things.
747,00:32:57.23,00:32:57.23,I think that you stand a good chance
748,00:32:58.90,00:32:58.90,of winning the lion's share.
749,00:33:00.30,00:33:00.30,It's just-- it doesn't work.
750,00:33:02.07,00:33:02.07,I just wanted to be straight with you.
751,00:33:03.30,00:33:03.30,'Cause I can't-- - I know.
752,00:33:04.30,00:33:04.30,- I can't play that lying game.
753,00:33:05.73,00:33:05.73,- You're a good guy.
754,00:33:06.87,00:33:06.87,"- Oh, and as if that's more ethical?"
755,00:33:08.73,00:33:08.73,"Because Lex is like, ""Well, I can't bold-faced lie to him."""
756,00:33:11.33,00:33:11.33,"Okay, you can just lie to him all day when it's..."
757,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,when it would be inconvenient to tell him the truth.
758,00:33:15.33,00:33:15.33,"But then at the last possible moment, you'll slip in the truth"
759,00:33:17.50,00:33:17.50,and that's going to make you an ethical person?
760,00:33:19.53,00:33:19.53,Okay.
761,00:33:20.67,00:33:20.67,"- All right. - Thanks, man."
762,00:33:22.10,00:33:22.10,- I like Clarence. The kid has really grown on me.
763,00:33:24.17,00:33:24.17,"I mean, he sensed that people were getting"
764,00:33:25.77,00:33:25.77,"rubbed the wrong way by him, and he changed his ways."
765,00:33:28.43,00:33:28.43,I like him. I think he's friendly.
766,00:33:30.43,00:33:30.43,I think he's funny.
767,00:33:31.70,00:33:31.70,"He's part of the group, unlike crazy, outcast Frank."
768,00:33:37.63,00:33:37.63,- I'm not holding anybody. We have our group and that's it.
769,00:33:39.90,00:33:39.90,- Right.
770,00:33:40.97,00:33:40.97,"- Everything else, the bets are off."
771,00:33:42.27,00:33:42.27,- Right.
772,00:33:43.27,00:33:43.27,I don't like being told what to do.
773,00:33:44.63,00:33:44.63,I don't know at this point that Lex is playing both ends
774,00:33:46.13,00:33:46.13,"against the middle, but I'm a little bit guarded"
775,00:33:48.87,00:33:48.87,with all that.
776,00:33:50.90,00:33:50.90,"- At least do me this, man, all right?"
777,00:33:52.90,00:33:52.90,"When you talk to everybody, tell them to keep us together."
778,00:33:55.60,00:33:55.60,There's six of us and four of them.
779,00:33:57.37,00:33:57.37,- So what?
780,00:33:58.60,00:33:58.60,"- I'm like you, we ought to go to the wire."
781,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,"You know, I'm with you."
782,00:34:02.23,00:34:02.23,- I don't want to be voted off when Brandon's still around
783,00:34:04.27,00:34:04.27,and Kim's still around.
784,00:34:05.30,00:34:05.30,- I know.
785,00:34:06.30,00:34:06.30,"Well, I'll be honest with you."
786,00:34:08.00,00:34:08.00,I'm ashamed to vote anybody off
787,00:34:10.93,00:34:10.93,besides Brandon at this next venture.
788,00:34:14.70,00:34:14.70,"- And that's 'cause it's loyalty, man."
789,00:34:17.97,00:34:17.97,- I won't vote for Clarence tonight because I told him
790,00:34:20.87,00:34:20.87,"I wouldn't do that, and he honored his word,"
791,00:34:22.73,00:34:22.73,and I feel like I've got to do the same.
792,00:34:24.50,00:34:24.50,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa
793,00:34:54.03,00:34:54.03,"- Well, congratulations to all you guys for surviving"
794,00:34:56.27,00:34:56.27,long enough to make the merge.
795,00:34:57.87,00:34:57.87,"Survive tonight's vote, you make it to the next phase"
796,00:35:00.40,00:35:00.40,"of this game, which is the jury."
797,00:35:03.23,00:35:03.23,The only person we know who is assured that spot
798,00:35:06.23,00:35:06.23,is Teresa after winning immunity.
799,00:35:08.83,00:35:08.83,Big day yesterday.
800,00:35:10.10,00:35:10.10,"Lot of changes, including a new name."
801,00:35:12.43,00:35:12.43,"Tell me about the name, Lex."
802,00:35:14.07,00:35:14.07,"- Uh, the name is Moto Maji,"
803,00:35:16.47,00:35:16.47,"which is Swahili for fire and water,"
804,00:35:19.97,00:35:19.97,"which are two very, very important things, pretty much"
805,00:35:22.43,00:35:22.43,the essential ingredients of life out here.
806,00:35:24.23,00:35:24.23,"- Ethan, a whole new tribe now."
807,00:35:26.47,00:35:26.47,What was the first day and the first night like getting along?
808,00:35:30.40,00:35:30.40,- It actually went pretty well.
809,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,Everyone's getting along great and we're joking and it's--
810,00:35:34.03,00:35:34.03,it's a good old-- big old happy family.
811,00:35:36.17,00:35:36.17,"- Brandon, did last night's celebration"
812,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,change your opinion of anybody?
813,00:35:41.40,00:35:41.40,Either stuff you'd heard or stuff you'd seen yourself
814,00:35:43.23,00:35:43.23,and thought yourself?
815,00:35:44.53,00:35:44.53,"- Frank, I have known since the beginning."
816,00:35:46.53,00:35:46.53,I've never known him to smile or crack a joke.
817,00:35:48.80,00:35:48.80,And last night he actually cracked a couple of jokes.
818,00:35:50.97,00:35:50.97,I almost hit the floor with a stroke.
819,00:35:53.90,00:35:53.90,"So I guess that changed, I mean, I saw a softer, more human--"
820,00:35:57.13,00:35:57.13,"humane side of Frank last night that I'd never seen before,"
821,00:36:00.50,00:36:00.50,which was very nice.
822,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,"- Tom, the game is still going on."
823,00:36:04.80,00:36:04.80,Is that in the back of your mind all the time?
824,00:36:06.83,00:36:06.83,- It don't let up-- it's unforgiving.
825,00:36:09.57,00:36:09.57,"You have a little high, but you-- it don't last long."
826,00:36:12.93,00:36:12.93,"Like our little party last night was great,"
827,00:36:16.37,00:36:16.37,"but just as soon as the cheese was gone, reality sets in."
828,00:36:19.60,00:36:19.60,"It's back to the whole push and grind and, uh,"
829,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,you got to go right back to looking around.
830,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"And if it's not the animals, it's the people in the game."
831,00:36:27.27,00:36:27.27,"- Well, for two of you guys, Teresa and Clarence,"
832,00:36:29.63,00:36:29.63,the immunity challenge obviously had
833,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,completely different stakes than for anyone else.
834,00:36:34.40,00:36:34.40,It had to be about immunity and feeling like you needed it.
835,00:36:38.07,00:36:38.07,"Is that true, Teresa, for you?"
836,00:36:39.90,00:36:39.90,"- Well, there are no certainties in this game at all,"
837,00:36:42.60,00:36:42.60,as we've seen each day or as we go along how things change.
838,00:36:46.23,00:36:46.23,"So I thought it'd be nice to know for sure that,"
839,00:36:49.90,00:36:49.90,"going to Tribal Council,"
840,00:36:51.27,00:36:51.27,that I might have a little security
841,00:36:52.70,00:36:52.70,just for a short period of time.
842,00:36:54.40,00:36:54.40,"- How about for you, Clarence?"
843,00:36:55.53,00:36:55.53,Immunity the overriding factor?
844,00:36:57.40,00:36:57.40,- I spent most of my time up there battling between hoping
845,00:37:02.13,00:37:02.13,"that there was a lot of loyalty left with old Boran,"
846,00:37:04.60,00:37:04.60,and struggling between maybe I needed this immunity.
847,00:37:07.97,00:37:07.97,So it was tough.
848,00:37:08.97,00:37:08.97,- So what made you quit?
849,00:37:10.37,00:37:10.37,"- I could tell she was in a great amount of pain, but I knew"
850,00:37:12.93,00:37:12.93,"that she wasn't going to quit, and so the only thing"
851,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,I could think that was fair and respectful to us both
852,00:37:19.07,00:37:19.07,"as competitors was rock, paper, scissors."
853,00:37:21.97,00:37:21.97,"I went rock, she went paper."
854,00:37:23.87,00:37:23.87,And I'm a man of my word.
855,00:37:25.97,00:37:25.97,"And seeing that lady, mom of two in her 40s,"
856,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,hold her arm up when everybody else was down
857,00:37:31.30,00:37:31.30,"going up against me, an athlete in my early 20s,"
858,00:37:35.30,00:37:35.30,"and having that will to not come down,"
859,00:37:39.23,00:37:39.23,it just blew me away.
860,00:37:40.57,00:37:40.57,I'll remember it for the rest of my life.
861,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,"- Is it fair to say, Ethan, that the game does change"
862,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87,at this point in terms of what you reveal to others
863,00:37:48.57,00:37:48.57,and who you can trust?
864,00:37:49.77,00:37:49.77,- It definitely changes.
865,00:37:51.07,00:37:51.07,"Depending how you're playing the game,"
866,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,it's important to yourself that you feel good
867,00:37:53.47,00:37:53.47,about what you say and you feel good
868,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,about how you say it and how you present yourself.
869,00:37:58.13,00:37:58.13,"I have a tough time looking someone in the eye and saying,"
870,00:38:00.63,00:38:00.63,"""You know, I love you, you're my best friend,"""
871,00:38:03.60,00:38:03.60,"and then, you know,"
872,00:38:05.00,00:38:05.00,"going and voting against them, you know?"
873,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,I like truth.
874,00:38:08.87,00:38:08.87,- It's time to vote.
875,00:38:09.97,00:38:09.97,"Ethan, you're up."
876,00:38:45.40,00:38:45.40,"- I know you explained things to me, man to man,"
877,00:38:47.33,00:38:47.33,and I respect that.
878,00:38:48.77,00:38:48.77,I've just got to make sure that I make things a little hard
879,00:38:50.70,00:38:50.70,on you on your way to winning this thing.
880,00:39:03.03,00:39:03.03,"- You are a really, really nice guy."
881,00:39:04.53,00:39:04.53,"I don't want to vote for anybody, actually."
882,00:39:06.90,00:39:06.90,"But, um, I wish you lots of luck in life."
883,00:39:17.33,00:39:17.33,"- Clarence, when you came to this game,"
884,00:39:19.73,00:39:19.73,you made some huge mistakes
885,00:39:21.50,00:39:21.50,and had a pretty rough start.
886,00:39:23.30,00:39:23.30,"But you've come a long way, my friend."
887,00:39:25.43,00:39:25.43,And it's been really good getting to know you.
888,00:39:28.53,00:39:28.53,But I am here to win the game.
889,00:39:30.43,00:39:30.43,To go all the way.
890,00:39:31.43,00:39:31.43,And you're too big a threat now.
891,00:39:32.97,00:39:32.97,"So, you got to go."
892,00:39:34.27,00:39:34.27,"Sorry, brother."
893,00:40:09.80,00:40:09.80,- This was a hard vote for me to cast.
894,00:40:12.63,00:40:12.63,"I think you're a wonderful, fascinating person."
895,00:40:15.03,00:40:15.03,"But your leadership, strength, and skills"
896,00:40:17.03,00:40:17.03,"make me a little nervous for down the road,"
897,00:40:18.87,00:40:18.87,so I'm giving you my vote.
898,00:40:25.40,00:40:25.40,- I'll go tally the votes.
899,00:40:41.57,00:40:41.57,"Once the votes have been read, the decision is final."
900,00:40:43.67,00:40:43.67,The person will be asked to leave
901,00:40:44.80,00:40:44.80,the Tribal Council area immediately.
902,00:40:46.57,00:40:46.57,I'll read the votes.
903,00:40:51.90,00:40:51.90,"First vote, Clarence."
904,00:40:59.20,00:40:59.20,Lex.
905,00:41:03.47,00:41:03.47,Clarence.
906,00:41:07.77,00:41:07.77,"Lex-- that's two votes Lex, two votes Clarence."
907,00:41:13.03,00:41:13.03,Clarence.
908,00:41:18.07,00:41:18.07,"That's four votes Clarence, two votes Lex."
909,00:41:23.20,00:41:23.20,Clarence.
910,00:41:27.77,00:41:27.77,Clarence.
911,00:41:28.77,00:41:28.77,"That's enough votes, Clarence."
912,00:41:30.20,00:41:30.20,You need to bring me your torch.
913,00:41:44.13,00:41:44.13,"Clarence, the tribe has spoken."
914,00:41:51.23,00:41:51.23,It's time for you to go. Take care.
915,00:42:07.03,00:42:07.03,- All right.
916,00:42:08.47,00:42:08.47,"No matter how well you do in this game, you will have"
917,00:42:10.03,00:42:10.03,"an impact on it, as you are now guaranteed a spot in our jury."
918,00:42:14.03,00:42:14.03,You guys can head back to camp.
919,00:42:16.77,00:42:16.77,(theme song playing)
920,00:42:30.37,00:42:30.37,(Probst) Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
921,00:42:34.07,00:42:34.07,(Probst) Next time on Survivor:
922,00:42:35.80,00:42:35.80,the tribe competes for an unusual reward.
923,00:42:39.57,00:42:39.57,Lex embarks on a witch hunt to find out who voted against him.
924,00:42:43.20,00:42:43.20,- I need to smoke that person out in the next three days
925,00:42:45.67,00:42:45.67,and cut their heads off.
926,00:42:47.03,00:42:47.03,(Probst) And the ex-Samburu members concoct a plan.
927,00:42:49.77,00:42:49.77,"- If we're going to make a move, it has to be"
928,00:42:51.47,00:42:51.47,this Tribal Council-- it has to be.
929,00:42:58.60,00:42:58.60,"- Well, you guys won fair and square, and I'm glad"
930,00:43:01.13,00:43:01.13,that I didn't do anything at any time
931,00:43:03.33,00:43:03.33,to dishonor myself from my mother.
932,00:43:05.77,00:43:05.77,"You know, I played a fair game and I lost."
933,00:43:08.20,00:43:08.20,And I lost because I was strong and I don't think there are
934,00:43:10.23,00:43:10.23,many people who can say they lost because they were strong.
935,00:43:13.07,00:43:13.07,And I lost with integrity.
936,00:43:15.40,00:43:15.40,"I would have won with integrity,"
937,00:43:16.67,00:43:16.67,and I'm glad I got this opportunity.
