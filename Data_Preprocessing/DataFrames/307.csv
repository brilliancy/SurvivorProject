217,00:10:16.17,00:10:16.17,A team wouldn'ttake a shower together.
218,00:10:18.00,00:10:18.00,It'd be more or lessan individual shower.
219,00:10:20.20,00:10:20.20,"- Based on the clues, what do--do you think it's a reward?"
220,00:10:22.00,00:10:22.00,Do you think it's immunity?- Immunity.

256,00:11:55.40,00:11:55.40,which is full of water.
257,00:11:56.93,00:11:56.93,"The slightest movement bringsthe bucket over,"
258,00:11:58.90,00:11:58.90,you're outof the challenge.

295,00:13:38.77,00:13:38.77,So I don't think we want himon the jury.

625,00:27:45.67,00:27:45.67,what I am.
626,00:27:47.10,00:27:47.10,"So maybewhatever visual he has,"
627,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,"he just sees a gentletail sway, a loping."

633,00:28:18.23,00:28:18.23,behind me like a tail.
634,00:28:21.47,00:28:21.47,"I don't know, at times it seemedlike he might have acknowledged,"
635,00:28:23.67,00:28:23.67,"stopped and looked over,you know?"
636,00:28:26.67,00:28:26.67,There's a few humans hereI wouldn't interact with.
637,00:28:29.57,00:28:29.57,"You know,but the animals, yes."
638,00:28:41.13,00:28:41.13,(indistinct chatter)

649,00:29:01.63,00:29:01.63,"- We're kind of brainstormingabout the name together,"
650,00:29:03.87,00:29:03.87,and somebody came upwith the idea
651,00:29:05.53,00:29:05.53,of getting the Swahilidefinition for water and fire.
652,00:29:10.27,00:29:10.27,And so what we came upwith it's Moto Maji
653,00:29:12.23,00:29:12.23,or something alongthose lines.
654,00:29:13.53,00:29:13.53,(overlapping chatter)

671,00:29:39.60,00:29:39.60,"They could have named it,you know, Theaters Anonymous,"

679,00:30:12.83,00:30:12.83,But it's so much morethan a game.
680,00:30:14.17,00:30:14.17,"I mean, we are thrustinto a survival situation"
681,00:30:18.07,00:30:18.07,in a strange place.
682,00:30:19.43,00:30:19.43,"We're pulling together,creating a society."
683,00:30:24.10,00:30:24.10,"At this point,we're down to ten people."

686,00:30:33.63,00:30:33.63,So the fact of the matter isis that you have to be

688,00:30:38.83,00:30:38.83,"what you say, what comments youmake about other people,"
689,00:30:41.53,00:30:41.53,"because these peopleare going to be on a jury,"
690,00:30:43.67,00:30:43.67,and they may discuss youamongst themselves.
691,00:30:45.90,00:30:45.90,And so now you have to bevery careful.
692,00:30:48.03,00:30:48.03,"- Brandon,you're unusually quiet."

756,00:33:13.33,00:33:13.33,when it would be inconvenientto tell him the truth.
757,00:33:15.33,00:33:15.33,"But then at the last possiblemoment, you'll slip in the truth"
758,00:33:17.50,00:33:17.50,and that's going to make youan ethical person?
759,00:33:19.53,00:33:19.53,Okay.

819,00:35:57.13,00:35:57.13,"humane side of Frank last nightthat I'd never seen before,"
820,00:36:00.50,00:36:00.50,which was very nice.
821,00:36:02.07,00:36:02.07,"- Tom, the gameis still going on."
822,00:36:04.80,00:36:04.80,Is that in the back of your mindall the time?
823,00:36:06.83,00:36:06.83,- It don't let up--it's unforgiving.
824,00:36:09.57,00:36:09.57,"You have a little high,but you-- it don't last long."
825,00:36:12.93,00:36:12.93,"Like our little partylast night was great,"
826,00:36:16.37,00:36:16.37,"but just as soon as the cheesewas gone, reality sets in."
827,00:36:19.60,00:36:19.60,"It's back to the whole pushand grind and, uh,"
828,00:36:22.00,00:36:22.00,you got to goright back to looking around.
829,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"And if it's not the animals,it's the people in the game."
830,00:36:27.27,00:36:27.27,"- Well, for two of youguys, Teresa and Clarence,"
831,00:36:29.63,00:36:29.63,the immunity challengeobviously had
832,00:36:31.83,00:36:31.83,completely differentstakes than for anyone else.
833,00:36:34.40,00:36:34.40,It had to be about immunityand feeling like you needed it.
834,00:36:38.07,00:36:38.07,"Is that true, Teresa,for you?"
835,00:36:39.90,00:36:39.90,"- Well, there are nocertainties in this game at all,"
836,00:36:42.60,00:36:42.60,as we've seen each day or aswe go along how things change.
837,00:36:46.23,00:36:46.23,"So I thought it'd be nice toknow for sure that,"
838,00:36:49.90,00:36:49.90,"going to Tribal Council,"
839,00:36:51.27,00:36:51.27,that I might havea little security
840,00:36:52.70,00:36:52.70,just for a short periodof time.
841,00:36:54.40,00:36:54.40,"- How about for you,Clarence?"
842,00:36:55.53,00:36:55.53,Immunitythe overriding factor?
843,00:36:57.40,00:36:57.40,- I spent most of my time upthere battling between hoping
844,00:37:02.13,00:37:02.13,"that there was a lot of loyaltyleft with old Boran,"
845,00:37:04.60,00:37:04.60,and struggling betweenmaybe I needed this immunity.
846,00:37:07.97,00:37:07.97,So it was tough.
847,00:37:08.97,00:37:08.97,- So what made you quit?
848,00:37:10.37,00:37:10.37,"- I could tell she was in agreat amount of pain, but I knew"
849,00:37:12.93,00:37:12.93,"that she wasn't going to quit,and so the only thing"
850,00:37:15.93,00:37:15.93,I could think that was fairand respectful to us both
851,00:37:19.07,00:37:19.07,"as competitors was rock,paper, scissors."
852,00:37:21.97,00:37:21.97,"I went rock, she went paper."
853,00:37:23.87,00:37:23.87,And I'm a man of my word.
854,00:37:25.97,00:37:25.97,"And seeing that lady,mom of two in her 40s,"
855,00:37:28.93,00:37:28.93,hold her arm up wheneverybody else was down
856,00:37:31.30,00:37:31.30,"going up against me,an athlete in my early 20s,"
857,00:37:35.30,00:37:35.30,"and having thatwill to not come down,"
858,00:37:39.23,00:37:39.23,it just blew me away.
859,00:37:40.57,00:37:40.57,I'll remember itfor the rest of my life.
860,00:37:43.17,00:37:43.17,"- Is it fair to say, Ethan,that the game does change"
861,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87,at this point in terms of whatyou reveal to others
862,00:37:48.57,00:37:48.57,and who you can trust?
863,00:37:49.77,00:37:49.77,- It definitely changes.
864,00:37:51.07,00:37:51.07,"Depending how you'replaying the game,"
865,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,it's important to yourselfthat you feel good
866,00:37:53.47,00:37:53.47,about what you sayand you feel good
867,00:37:55.67,00:37:55.67,about how you say itand how you present yourself.
868,00:37:58.13,00:37:58.13,"I have a tough time lookingsomeone in the eye and saying,"
869,00:38:00.63,00:38:00.63,"""You know, I love you,you're my best friend,"""
870,00:38:03.60,00:38:03.60,"and then, you know,"
871,00:38:05.00,00:38:05.00,"going and votingagainst them, you know?"
872,00:38:06.97,00:38:06.97,I like truth.
873,00:38:08.87,00:38:08.87,- It's time to vote.
874,00:38:09.97,00:38:09.97,"Ethan, you're up."
875,00:38:45.40,00:38:45.40,"- I know you explained thingsto me, man to man,"
876,00:38:47.33,00:38:47.33,and I respect that.
877,00:38:48.77,00:38:48.77,I've just got to make sure thatI make things a little hard
878,00:38:50.70,00:38:50.70,on you on your wayto winning this thing.
879,00:39:03.03,00:39:03.03,"- You are a really,really nice guy."
880,00:39:04.53,00:39:04.53,"I don't want to votefor anybody, actually."
881,00:39:06.90,00:39:06.90,"But, um, I wish youlots of luck in life."
882,00:39:17.33,00:39:17.33,"- Clarence, when you cameto this game,"
883,00:39:19.73,00:39:19.73,you made some huge mistakes
884,00:39:21.50,00:39:21.50,and had a pretty roughstart.
885,00:39:23.30,00:39:23.30,"But you've comea long way, my friend."
886,00:39:25.43,00:39:25.43,And it's been really goodgetting to know you.
887,00:39:28.53,00:39:28.53,But I am here to win the game.
888,00:39:30.43,00:39:30.43,To go all the way.
889,00:39:31.43,00:39:31.43,And you're too big a threat now.
890,00:39:32.97,00:39:32.97,"So, you got to go."
891,00:39:34.27,00:39:34.27,"Sorry, brother."
892,00:40:09.80,00:40:09.80,- This was a hard votefor me to cast.
893,00:40:12.63,00:40:12.63,"I think you're a wonderful,fascinating person."
894,00:40:15.03,00:40:15.03,"But your leadership,strength, and skills"
895,00:40:17.03,00:40:17.03,"make me a littlenervous for down the road,"
896,00:40:18.87,00:40:18.87,so I'm giving youmy vote.
897,00:40:25.40,00:40:25.40,- I'll go tally the votes.
898,00:40:41.57,00:40:41.57,"Once the votes have been read,the decision is final."
899,00:40:43.67,00:40:43.67,The person will beasked to leave
900,00:40:44.80,00:40:44.80,the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
901,00:40:46.57,00:40:46.57,I'll read the votes.
902,00:40:51.90,00:40:51.90,"First vote, Clarence."

910,00:41:28.77,00:41:28.77,"That's enough votes, Clarence."
911,00:41:30.20,00:41:30.20,You need to bring meyour torch.
912,00:41:44.13,00:41:44.13,"Clarence, the tribe has spoken."
913,00:41:51.23,00:41:51.23,It's time for you to go.Take care.
914,00:42:07.03,00:42:07.03,- All right.
915,00:42:08.47,00:42:08.47,"No matter how well you doin this game, you will have"
916,00:42:10.03,00:42:10.03,"an impact on it, as you are nowguaranteed a spot in our jury."

923,00:42:43.20,00:42:43.20,- I need to smoke that personout in the next three days
924,00:42:45.67,00:42:45.67,and cut their heads off.
925,00:42:47.03,00:42:47.03,(Probst)And the ex-Samburumembers concoct a plan.
926,00:42:49.77,00:42:49.77,"- If we're going to makea move, it has to be"
927,00:42:51.47,00:42:51.47,this Tribal Council--it has to be.

932,00:43:08.20,00:43:08.20,And I lost because I was strongand I don't think there are
933,00:43:10.23,00:43:10.23,many people who can say theylost because they were strong.
934,00:43:13.07,00:43:13.07,And I lost with integrity.
935,00:43:15.40,00:43:15.40,"I would have wonwith integrity,"
