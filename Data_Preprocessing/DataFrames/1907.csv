32,00:01:31.96,00:01:31.96,was canceled. Nobody will be voted out
33,00:01:35.38,00:01:35.38,tonight. The loss of Russell re-ignited
34,00:01:39.17,00:01:39.17,the rivalry between the two tribes.

40,00:01:54.46,00:01:54.46,Who will be voted out tonight? >> Losing Russell affects
41,00:02:09.25,00:02:09.25,"the game tremendously. You know, losing our chief."
42,00:02:12.17,00:02:12.17,Losing probably the guy who I had the most confidence in
43,00:02:15.25,00:02:15.25,personally in this game. >> He played the game like he
44,00:02:18.42,00:02:18.42,"was 35, and he's not. >> Yeah."
45,00:02:20.79,00:02:20.79,">> With Russell here, we had a 5-4 gender-alliance lead,"
46,00:02:25.17,00:02:25.17,"but now with Russell gone, it's just 4-4, and it's anybody's"
47,00:02:27.96,00:02:27.96,ball game. Exactly.
48,00:02:44.25,00:02:44.25,">> Exactly. >> Even though she's a chick,"
49,00:02:48.92,00:02:48.92,Shambo doesn't fit in with the other girls.
50,00:02:50.50,00:02:50.50,So we have to pull Shambo back over to our side and make sure
51,00:02:53.88,00:02:53.88,that Shambo is like one of the dudes.
52,00:02:55.96,00:02:55.96,>> The only way that plan unravels is if the girls lock

57,00:04:37.46,00:04:37.46,Let's do it. >> Tribal was real nice.
58,00:04:45.17,00:04:45.17,"When Jeff said we wasn't going to eliminate anybody, and I"
59,00:04:48.00,00:04:48.00,"knew Galu just lost big Russell, man, I was stoked."
60,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,"I was, like, ""Oh, we have a shot at this."""
61,00:04:54.83,00:04:54.83,"You know, it's 5 to 8 now, it's pretty damn close."
62,00:05:07.83,00:05:07.83,">> Liz wasn't voted out, but it keeps the tribe stronger by"
63,00:05:11.04,00:05:11.04,keeping her. So I'd rather just win three in
64,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,a row and then get rid of her. >> It could be a new day.
65,00:05:17.17,00:05:17.17,The tides have turned. >> That's right.
66,00:05:18.83,00:05:18.83,It is a new day. That's right. >> Start with this one.
67,00:05:22.17,00:05:22.17,>> I'm so excited! >> So am I.
68,00:05:35.54,00:05:35.54,(yawns) >> So I was thinking
69,00:05:53.25,00:05:53.25,"about it, thinking about it, thinking about it, and the way"
70,00:05:55.75,00:05:55.75,"we're going to lock Shambo in is not only to, you know, to"
71,00:05:58.54,00:05:58.54,"tell her, ""Hey, we're cool with you,"" but us four guys are"
72,00:06:01.54,00:06:01.54,gonna nominate Shambo our new new chief.
73,00:06:04.38,00:06:04.38,And she's gonna feel so so important and so flattered
74,00:06:07.29,00:06:07.29,that she'll be as deep in my pocket as the lint at the
75,00:06:11.46,00:06:11.46,"very bottom. You know, this tribe does need"
76,00:06:14.21,00:06:14.21,a new leader. And I think you're the best
77,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,for the job. >> Okay.
78,00:06:19.29,00:06:19.29,"We've got to put it to a vote, though."
79,00:06:22.88,00:06:22.88,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, we need to do that."
80,00:06:39.54,00:06:39.54,>> Okay. Okay. >> Ready? One...
81,00:06:43.17,00:06:43.17,>> ...two... >> ...three...
82,00:06:45.04,00:06:45.04,>> ...four... >> ...five...
83,00:06:46.42,00:06:46.42,>> ...six... >> ...seven...
84,00:06:47.92,00:06:47.92,>> ...eight. >> Okay.
85,00:06:48.92,00:06:48.92,">> So, at the count of three, you just put up the number."
86,00:06:51.17,00:06:51.17,>> Okay. >> One...
87,00:06:53.92,00:06:53.92,...two... ...three.
88,00:06:55.62,00:06:55.62,">> Okay, so wait. How many threes?"
89,00:06:58.17,00:06:58.17,">> Four threes. >> Four, four."
90,00:07:00.12,00:07:00.12,So that's... >> Four votes for Sham.
91,00:07:02.33,00:07:02.33,>> Four votes for Sham. >> Sham's the leader.
92,00:07:04.42,00:07:04.42,>> Congratulations. (man laughs)
93,00:07:08.12,00:07:08.12,>> I thought the way to elect the new leader was stupid.
94,00:07:11.21,00:07:11.21,It went by so quickly that no one even really realized
95,00:07:13.92,00:07:13.92,"what happened. Um, I don't know how Shambo got"
96,00:07:18.08,00:07:18.08,elected leader. And they're supposed to be
97,00:07:19.96,00:07:19.96,sending Shambo home last night. I'm wondering if there was a
98,00:07:23.00,00:07:23.00,"vote last night, would I have been one of the people"
99,00:07:26.79,00:07:26.79,"voted for? >> Okay, I would like my first"
100,00:07:30.00,00:07:30.00,act of... to be one of motivation and kindness.
101,00:07:33.75,00:07:33.75,"I, obviously, did not ask for this."
102,00:07:36.38,00:07:36.38,I will do the best I can by you guys.
103,00:07:38.67,00:07:38.67,"My leadership style is night and day from Russ, and I will"
104,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,"honestly, honestly, honestly do my due diligence to not be"
105,00:07:49.21,00:07:49.21,bossy 'cause you can't really be a sergeant in the United
106,00:07:52.25,00:07:52.25,States Marine Corps and not have an expectation when you
107,00:07:54.92,00:07:54.92,"say something, things will happen."
108,00:07:57.46,00:07:57.46,>> I think us four guys plus using Shambo as a wedge is a
109,00:08:03.12,00:08:03.12,"good plan. I mean, the only strategic"
110,00:08:06.46,00:08:06.46,drawbacks I could think of is that Shambo is just so dim that
111,00:08:11.88,00:08:11.88,she could screw up our plans if we tell her anything.
112,00:08:24.54,00:08:24.54,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! How's everybody doing?"
113,00:08:38.92,00:08:38.92,The sun is out. >> Very thankful.
114,00:08:40.67,00:08:40.67,">> Happy, happy, happy. >> PROBST: Shambo, you're"
115,00:08:43.21,00:08:43.21,wearing the leadership necklace. You're the leader of Galu?
116,00:08:45.96,00:08:45.96,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: Surprised?"
117,00:08:47.96,00:08:47.96,>> Not so much. I've had a lifetime of
118,00:08:50.75,00:08:50.75,leadership skills through just the way I was raised;
119,00:08:54.04,00:08:54.04,"second-generation Marine, so I just gotta keep things in"
120,00:08:57.12,00:08:57.12,"perspective and be calm. >> PROBST: All right, we're"
121,00:08:59.75,00:08:59.75,going to put your leadership skills to test today.
122,00:09:02.25,00:09:02.25,You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
123,00:09:04.50,00:09:04.50,>> Yep. >> Definitely.
124,00:09:06.25,00:09:06.25,>> PROBST: Today's challenge will test your memory and will
125,00:09:08.21,00:09:08.21,force to you make decisions between wants and needs.
126,00:09:12.21,00:09:12.21,Here's how it works: scattered out in the field
127,00:09:14.58,00:09:14.58,there are 13 pairs of matching survival items.
128,00:09:18.50,00:09:18.50,One tribe member at a time will walk out and uncover two items.
129,00:09:21.96,00:09:21.96,"If they match, you score a point for your tribe."
130,00:09:24.21,00:09:24.21,"If at any point along the way, the leader of your tribe"
131,00:09:27.96,00:09:27.96,"decides they would like to keep the items you just matched, you"
132,00:09:31.25,00:09:31.25,"can do so, but you forfeit the point in the challenge."
133,00:09:36.17,00:09:36.17,"To make things more difficult, four of the items are dummy"
134,00:09:39.54,00:09:39.54,items that do not have a match. The tribe who has the most
135,00:09:42.42,00:09:42.42,points at the end of challenge wins reward.
136,00:09:44.12,00:09:44.12,Want to know what you're playing for?
137,00:09:46.00,00:09:46.00,">> Yes, sir. >> Yeah."
138,00:09:47.04,00:09:47.04,>> PROBST: Winning tribe will leave from here and board
139,00:09:48.92,00:09:48.92,"a beautiful sailboat. >> Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh."
140,00:09:51.62,00:09:51.62,>> PROBST: You'll enjoy an afternoon out on the water and
141,00:09:54.04,00:09:54.04,a nice lunch. >> Oh!
142,00:09:56.00,00:09:56.00,">> PROBST: In addition, the winning tribe will send one"
143,00:09:57.96,00:09:57.96,person from their tribe to the losing tribe to do a little
144,00:10:00.83,00:10:00.83,spying until the next immunity challenge.
145,00:10:03.08,00:10:03.08,You guys ready to get to it? >> Yes.
146,00:10:05.08,00:10:05.08,">> Yes, sir. >> PROBST: Galu you're sitting"
147,00:10:06.62,00:10:06.62,out three people this challenge. This is a new cycle.
148,00:10:08.92,00:10:08.92,You can sit out whoever you you want.
149,00:10:10.75,00:10:10.75,">> Kelly, Dave, and myself will sit out."
150,00:10:13.21,00:10:13.21,">> PROBST: Kelly, Dave, and Shambo."
151,00:10:14.71,00:10:14.71,You guys take a spot on the bench.
152,00:10:16.38,00:10:16.38,"Everybody else, give you a minute to strategize."
153,00:10:18.17,00:10:18.17,"We'll get started. All right, Shambo, since you"
154,00:10:23.75,00:10:23.75,"are the new leader and you are not participating, who do you"
155,00:10:26.75,00:10:26.75,want to assign to make decisions for Galu
156,00:10:28.79,00:10:28.79,in this challenge? >> Erik.
157,00:10:30.33,00:10:30.33,">> No, no, Brett, Brett, Brett. >> I stand corrected; Brett."
158,00:10:33.92,00:10:33.92,>> PROBST: Brett will be the fill-in leader for this
159,00:10:36.04,00:10:36.04,"challenge. All right, head out."
160,00:10:38.17,00:10:38.17,"Russell goes out first for Foa Foa, who won the rock,"
161,00:10:41.92,00:10:41.92,"paper, scissor. That is a fire-starting kit."
162,00:10:45.25,00:10:45.25,That is representative of what the real kit looks like.
163,00:10:48.17,00:10:48.17,"It is much larger. And rope, no match."
164,00:10:52.50,00:10:52.50,Cover 'em back up. Galu. John heads out for his
165,00:10:57.58,00:10:57.58,first shot at this challenge. John finds the cleaver.
166,00:11:04.92,00:11:04.92,"Right next door, mosquito net. No match for Galu."
167,00:11:09.54,00:11:09.54,Should get interesting now. Jaison heading out for Foa Foa.
168,00:11:15.04,00:11:15.04,A lantern and oil. That has not been revealed
169,00:11:18.79,00:11:18.79,"anywhere else so it's a wild guess, shot in the dark."
170,00:11:23.96,00:11:23.96,Fire starting kit. No match.
171,00:11:26.33,00:11:26.33,>> That's a big break. Big break.
172,00:11:28.29,00:11:28.29,>> I got it. >> PROBST: Galu.
173,00:11:30.25,00:11:30.25,">> Go get it, Laura. >> PROBST: Laura going out now."
174,00:11:32.04,00:11:32.04,Looking for that first match. Laura finds one fire starting
175,00:11:36.08,00:11:36.08,kit. Jaison just uncovered one.
176,00:11:39.17,00:11:39.17,Can Laura remember where it was? And she does.
177,00:11:43.46,00:11:43.46,Laura scores the first match for Galu.
178,00:11:46.58,00:11:46.58,"As I said, that is merely representative."
179,00:11:49.25,00:11:49.25,This is the kit. Everything you need to get fire
180,00:11:52.29,00:11:52.29,started all wrapped in a tarp. >> We'll keep it.
181,00:11:55.08,00:11:55.08,>> Thank God. >> PROBST: Brett's going to
182,00:11:56.83,00:11:56.83,"keep this one. >> Good job, Galu."
183,00:11:59.08,00:11:59.08,">> Good job, team. >> That tarp's gonna keep us"
184,00:12:01.08,00:12:01.08,"dry, right? Right? >> PROBST: Galu scores the"
185,00:12:03.21,00:12:03.21,first match but forfeits the point in exchange for keeping
186,00:12:06.50,00:12:06.50,the item. We're still at 0-0.
187,00:12:10.54,00:12:10.54,"Foa Foa, head out. Liz with her first time out on"
188,00:12:14.04,00:12:14.04,the course would love to get lucky.
189,00:12:17.46,00:12:17.46,"Liz finds the cleaver. >> Oh, gosh, Liz, come on."
190,00:12:20.88,00:12:20.88,>> PROBST: Can Liz remember where the other cleaver was?

301,00:18:08.33,00:18:08.33,I'm a theology student. >> Really?
302,00:18:10.33,00:18:10.33,>> Mm-hmm. I got my degree in women's
303,00:18:12.33,00:18:12.33,ministries. >> Really?
304,00:18:14.33,00:18:14.33,>> I don't want to be a pastor of men.

313,00:18:34.04,00:18:34.04,"But if we can get together, you could protect me at the merge,"
314,00:18:37.17,00:18:37.17,"and I can protect you. You know, when it comes down to"
315,00:18:39.50,00:18:39.50,"it, I hope it's final three, 'cause you know what I hope?"
316,00:18:41.50,00:18:41.50,"I would hope it would be me, you and Natalie in the final"
317,00:18:43.75,00:18:43.75,"three. Well, I was happy when they"

319,00:18:50.75,00:18:50.75,"like we're going to go with numbers into a merge, so what I"
320,00:18:53.38,00:18:53.38,have to do now is work my Houdini magic on Laura.
321,00:18:57.21,00:18:57.21,I can spot a good Christian any time.
322,00:19:00.21,00:19:00.21,It's easy. So I'm starting to really like
323,00:19:02.46,00:19:02.46,you now. (Laura laughs)
324,00:19:04.46,00:19:04.46,">> Brother from another mother. >> So, I'm going to start"

327,00:19:14.96,00:19:14.96,"I swear to you, you can trust me."
328,00:19:17.25,00:19:17.25,">> What are we going to do, go to the final two, the two of us"
329,00:19:20.25,00:19:20.25,together? >> Final two.
330,00:19:22.25,00:19:22.25,>> Russell came to me and was conspiring to have this secret
331,00:19:25.12,00:19:25.12,"alliance that, clearly, nobody would ever suspect."
332,00:19:29.12,00:19:29.12,"And, you know, that's another card that I stick in my pocket"
333,00:19:32.08,00:19:32.08,"that I might want to play. I mean, you know, it's just food"
334,00:19:34.25,00:19:34.25,"for thought. >> And by the way, that clue you"

336,00:19:38.25,00:19:38.25,>> You might as well throw it away.
337,00:19:40.25,00:19:40.25,There's no immunity idol here. >> Did you find it?
338,00:19:42.25,00:19:42.25,>> Ben found it and didn't play it.
339,00:19:44.25,00:19:44.25,Hid it somewhere in the camp. (indistinct chatter)
340,00:19:50.04,00:19:50.04,">> Oh, my gosh! (indistinct chatter)"

345,00:20:15.83,00:20:15.83,"know? Like, what have I ever done in"
346,00:20:19.12,00:20:19.12,life that has been so great that deserves that kind of an

348,00:20:31.54,00:20:31.54,">> Are we helping, or are we watching?"
349,00:20:33.54,00:20:33.54,">> Uh, you're doing both. >> Excellent."
350,00:20:38.25,00:20:38.25,>> Yay! Yay!

368,00:21:45.04,00:21:45.04,They fed us this beef stew that was delicious.
369,00:21:47.58,00:21:47.58,It was almost all meat and a big chunk of handmade bread and
370,00:21:53.96,00:21:53.96,these amazing scones. They were delicious.
371,00:21:57.54,00:21:57.54,"I was having a good time, man. >> This is so beautiful."
372,00:22:07.17,00:22:07.17,What a nice change after 16 days of hell.

374,00:22:16.88,00:22:16.88,not sending me. Shambo ended up sending Laura
375,00:22:20.04,00:22:20.04,to the other camp. I think it just was her own
376,00:22:23.58,00:22:23.58,"little way of saying, ""I'mn ""leader now, and what"

405,00:24:27.38,00:24:27.38,Laura around the camp. So I have to keep Natalie for
406,00:24:30.67,00:24:30.67,"my little toy. You know, she has to be there"

564,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,"You know, I couldn't get with the program."
565,00:34:28.58,00:34:28.58,I kind of felt like dead weight to the team.
566,00:34:31.12,00:34:31.12,"So, for all I know, they could be voting me out."
567,00:34:34.62,00:34:34.62,"Well, sorry about my performance on the puzzle."
568,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,I couldn't figure that thing out to save my life today.
569,00:34:40.38,00:34:40.38,>> Yeah. >> I'm trying to concentrate on
570,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,putting it behind me. Hope tomorrow's a brighter day.
571,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,">> Okay. >> Okay, these are the two"
572,00:34:56.62,00:34:56.62,"options. Now, I've been thinking about"
573,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,"this. Natalie, for sure... or..."
574,00:35:01.04,00:35:01.04,>> Yeah? >> ...Jaison.
575,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,>> I know. >> Now listen why.
576,00:35:06.54,00:35:06.54,>> He's been dragging his feet lately.
577,00:35:09.25,00:35:09.25,"Yeah. Yeah, go back."
578,00:35:20.21,00:35:20.21,">> With tonight's Tribal Council, my survivor stock has"
579,00:35:23.08,00:35:23.08,gone up because I certainly thought the vote would be
580,00:35:26.04,00:35:26.04,"between me and Natalie, just because we're physically, you"
581,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,"know, smaller, weaker, than the three guys, but I guess,"
582,00:35:33.04,00:35:33.04,"strategically, you know, it may make more sense for Jaison to"
583,00:35:35.54,00:35:35.54,"go, and I'm actually quite thrilled because I never would"
584,00:35:39.12,00:35:39.12,"have anticipated that. >> You know, I got a decision"
585,00:35:47.04,00:35:47.04,to make. It's going to have to be either
586,00:35:50.25,00:35:50.25,"Liz or Jaison. The thing is, with Liz, I don't"
587,00:35:53.58,00:35:53.58,know if we can trust her once the merge happens.
588,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,"But the thing is with Jaison, I still think I can trust the"
589,00:35:59.12,00:35:59.12,"guy, but, you know, we still got to think about winning in"
590,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,challenges. We're losing with the team we
591,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,have. We've got to find some way to
592,00:36:06.83,00:36:06.83,win. Something has to give.
593,00:36:36.04,00:36:36.04,">> PROBST: Well, there's no use going over the dismal facts."
594,00:36:39.25,00:36:39.25,"Losing eight out of ten challenges, or the fact that"
595,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,"after tonight, you'll be down to four members, while Galu holds"
596,00:36:45.12,00:36:45.12,strong at eight. One of the worst overall
597,00:36:47.58,00:36:47.58,performances of any tribe in the history of the game.
598,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"Natalie, what I want to know is, where is the attitude on this"
599,00:36:55.62,00:36:55.62,tribe? Still hanging in there?
600,00:36:57.75,00:36:57.75,">> Absolutely. It doesn't do any good, uh, to"
601,00:37:00.71,00:37:00.71,"get negative, so we have to go in to any challenge with our"
602,00:37:05.12,00:37:05.12,"heads up, because if we don't, then we're done, so..."
603,00:37:08.92,00:37:08.92,">> PROBST: Russell, do you still wake up every morning and think,"
604,00:37:11.79,00:37:11.79,"today's the day? >> Yup, every morning."
605,00:37:14.83,00:37:14.83,All we really can do is hope for the merge 'cause they outplayed
606,00:37:18.67,00:37:18.67,us. They're outlasting us.
607,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,But one thing I promise you-- them kids over there-- there's
608,00:37:23.54,00:37:23.54,no way in hell that they can outwit me.
609,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,">> PROBST: Liz, if you get to a merge, do you trust these guys?"
610,00:37:30.62,00:37:30.62,>> Absolutely. There is no doubt.
611,00:37:33.88,00:37:33.88,"After all these Tribal Councils, I absolutely trust"
612,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,each and every one of these people up here with me 100%.
613,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,">> PROBST: Mick, any doubt in your mind about the"
614,00:37:43.62,00:37:43.62,trustworthiness of this group of people?
615,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,">> Honestly, Jeff, none. The performance aspect-- we"
616,00:37:49.71,00:37:49.71,"haven't done great, obviously. But there's still a social game"
617,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,"to be played, and that trust is at the absolute core of our"
618,00:37:56.25,00:37:56.25,"survival, and we all know that. >> PROBST: So, Russell, being"
619,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,"this tight, got to be hard to vote somebody out again tonight."
620,00:38:04.17,00:38:04.17,">> It is very hard. You know, five people down to"
621,00:38:07.83,00:38:07.83,"four people. You know, it almost seems"
622,00:38:09.96,00:38:09.96,"hopeless, but if we can just keep that four together, then"
623,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,you'll see. You'll see exactly...
624,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,"The whole thing's gonna change. >> PROBST: Jaison, since we got"
625,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,"here, you've been like this all night."
626,00:38:22.50,00:38:22.50,Occasionally popping your head up.
627,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,What's the hardest part about this for you?
628,00:38:27.42,00:38:27.42,">> I am frustrated with losing, is really what I'm frustrated"
629,00:38:30.12,00:38:30.12,about. And I actually do feel like I
630,00:38:32.50,00:38:32.50,have some large responsibility in these losses.
631,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"You know, today in the puzzle. You know, I feel like Mick did"
632,00:38:39.38,00:38:39.38,a really good job figuring out what the pattern was.
633,00:38:41.42,00:38:41.42,"I think Liz had the pattern going, but I just couldn't"
634,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,"figure out how to see the pattern at my end, and so, I"
635,00:38:48.71,00:38:48.71,don't feel like I performed at a level at which I should have.
636,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,>> PROBST: So if you're voted out tonight based on today's
637,00:38:55.58,00:38:55.58,"performance, would it be fair? >> If they decide that, you"
638,00:39:01.58,00:39:01.58,"know, my performance today warrants me to walk away, I hope"
639,00:39:05.25,00:39:05.25,that that is what is necessary for them to win tomorrow.
640,00:39:10.17,00:39:10.17,">> PROBST: All right, it is time to vote."
641,00:39:12.75,00:39:12.75,"Mick, you're up. >> This is totally strategic"
642,00:39:26.75,00:39:26.75,and not at all personal. Sorry.
643,00:39:50.00,00:39:50.00,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
644,00:40:03.21,00:40:03.21,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
645,00:40:06.12,00:40:06.12,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
646,00:40:09.00,00:40:09.00,immediately. I'll read the votes.
647,00:40:13.21,00:40:13.21,First vote-- Jaison. Liz.
648,00:40:20.54,00:40:20.54,"One vote-- Jaison, one vote-- Liz."
649,00:40:25.58,00:40:25.58,"Liz. That's two votes Liz, one vote"
650,00:40:28.50,00:40:28.50,Jaison. Sixth person voted out of
651,00:40:33.17,00:40:33.17,Survivor: Samoa-- Liz. That's three. That's enough.
652,00:40:36.17,00:40:36.17,You need to bring me your torch.
653,00:40:38.29,00:40:38.29,">> Good luck, guys. >> PROBST: Liz, the tribe has"
654,00:40:47.88,00:40:47.88,spoken. Time for you to go.
655,00:41:00.54,00:41:00.54,"Well, you haven't been very successful at challenges, but"
656,00:41:02.58,00:41:02.58,you're getting really good at blindsides.
657,00:41:04.62,00:41:04.62,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
658,00:41:07.08,00:41:07.08,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
659,00:41:26.17,00:41:26.17,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
660,00:41:33.75,00:41:33.75,"Survivor. (indistinct chatter, cheering)"
661,00:41:36.79,00:41:36.79,>> To our new tribe. >> New tribe.
662,00:41:38.79,00:41:38.79,"(whooping) >> All of a sudden, all hell"
663,00:41:40.79,00:41:40.79,breaks loose. >> Monica needs to go home
664,00:41:42.79,00:41:42.79,tonight. >> It's Erik 100%.
665,00:41:48.00,00:41:48.00,>> I got to do what I got to do. Things are going to get crazy
666,00:41:50.00,00:41:50.00,tomorrow out here. >> This experience was...
667,00:41:57.71,00:41:57.71,It was nothing but intense. My tribe mates outwitted me.
668,00:42:01.71,00:42:01.71,"It was a very strategic move, and the tables turned so quickly"
669,00:42:05.42,00:42:05.42,"that, you know, it's a little bit surprising, but kudos to"
670,00:42:08.25,00:42:08.25,"them. I really, really hope that they"
671,00:42:10.29,00:42:10.29,"make it to the end. And this is one hell of a game,"
672,00:42:13.12,00:42:13.12,so I'm glad I made it as far as I did.
