563,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,"You know, I couldn't get withthe program."
564,00:34:28.58,00:34:28.58,I kind of felt like dead weightto the team.
565,00:34:31.12,00:34:31.12,"So, for all I know, they couldbe voting me out."
566,00:34:34.62,00:34:34.62,"Well, sorry about my performanceon the puzzle."
567,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,I couldn't figure that thing outto save my life today.
568,00:34:40.38,00:34:40.38,>> Yeah.>> I'm trying to concentrate on
569,00:34:42.38,00:34:42.38,putting it behind me.Hope tomorrow's a brighter day.
570,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,">> Okay.>> Okay, these are the two"
571,00:34:56.62,00:34:56.62,"options.Now, I've been thinking about"
572,00:34:58.67,00:34:58.67,"this.Natalie, for sure... or..."
573,00:35:01.04,00:35:01.04,>> Yeah?>> ...Jaison.
574,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,>> I know.>> Now listen why.
575,00:35:06.54,00:35:06.54,>> He's been dragging his feetlately.
576,00:35:09.25,00:35:09.25,"Yeah.Yeah, go back."
577,00:35:20.21,00:35:20.21,">> With tonight's TribalCouncil, my survivor stock has"
578,00:35:23.08,00:35:23.08,gone up because I certainlythought the vote would be
579,00:35:26.04,00:35:26.04,"between me and Natalie, justbecause we're physically, you"
580,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,"know, smaller, weaker, than thethree guys, but I guess,"
581,00:35:33.04,00:35:33.04,"strategically, you know, it maymake more sense for Jaison to"
582,00:35:35.54,00:35:35.54,"go, and I'm actually quitethrilled because I never would"
583,00:35:39.12,00:35:39.12,"have anticipated that.>> You know, I got a decision"
584,00:35:47.04,00:35:47.04,to make.It's going to have to be either
585,00:35:50.25,00:35:50.25,"Liz or Jaison.The thing is, with Liz, I don't"
586,00:35:53.58,00:35:53.58,know if we can trust her oncethe merge happens.
587,00:35:56.17,00:35:56.17,"But the thing is with Jaison, Istill think I can trust the"
588,00:35:59.12,00:35:59.12,"guy, but, you know, we stillgot to think about winning in"
589,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,challenges.We're losing with the team we
590,00:36:05.08,00:36:05.08,have.We've got to find some way to
591,00:36:06.83,00:36:06.83,win.Something has to give.
592,00:36:36.04,00:36:36.04,">> PROBST: Well, there's no usegoing over the dismal facts."
593,00:36:39.25,00:36:39.25,"Losing eight out of tenchallenges, or the fact that"
594,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,"after tonight, you'll be down tofour members, while Galu holds"
595,00:36:45.12,00:36:45.12,strong at eight.One of the worst overall
596,00:36:47.58,00:36:47.58,performances of any tribe inthe history of the game.
597,00:36:51.42,00:36:51.42,"Natalie, what I want to know is,where is the attitude on this"
598,00:36:55.62,00:36:55.62,tribe?Still hanging in there?
599,00:36:57.75,00:36:57.75,">> Absolutely.It doesn't do any good, uh, to"
600,00:37:00.71,00:37:00.71,"get negative, so we have to goin to any challenge with our"
601,00:37:05.12,00:37:05.12,"heads up, because if we don't,then we're done, so..."
602,00:37:08.92,00:37:08.92,">> PROBST: Russell, do you stillwake up every morning and think,"
603,00:37:11.79,00:37:11.79,"today's the day?>> Yup, every morning."
604,00:37:14.83,00:37:14.83,All we really can do is hope forthe merge 'cause they outplayed
605,00:37:18.67,00:37:18.67,us.They're outlasting us.
606,00:37:21.00,00:37:21.00,But one thing I promise you--them kids over there-- there's
607,00:37:23.54,00:37:23.54,no way in hell that they canoutwit me.
608,00:37:27.00,00:37:27.00,">> PROBST: Liz, if you get to amerge, do you trust these guys?"
609,00:37:30.62,00:37:30.62,>> Absolutely.There is no doubt.
610,00:37:33.88,00:37:33.88,"After all these TribalCouncils, I absolutely trust"
611,00:37:37.17,00:37:37.17,each and every one of thesepeople up here with me 100%.
612,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,">> PROBST: Mick, any doubt inyour mind about the"
613,00:37:43.62,00:37:43.62,trustworthiness of this groupof people?
614,00:37:46.33,00:37:46.33,">> Honestly, Jeff, none.The performance aspect-- we"
615,00:37:49.71,00:37:49.71,"haven't done great, obviously.But there's still a social game"
616,00:37:52.50,00:37:52.50,"to be played, and that trust isat the absolute core of our"
617,00:37:56.25,00:37:56.25,"survival, and we all know that.>> PROBST: So, Russell, being"
618,00:37:59.08,00:37:59.08,"this tight, got to be hard tovote somebody out again tonight."
619,00:38:04.17,00:38:04.17,">> It is very hard.You know, five people down to"
620,00:38:07.83,00:38:07.83,"four people.You know, it almost seems"
621,00:38:09.96,00:38:09.96,"hopeless, but if we can justkeep that four together, then"
622,00:38:12.75,00:38:12.75,you'll see.You'll see exactly...
623,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,"The whole thing's gonna change.>> PROBST: Jaison, since we got"
624,00:38:20.17,00:38:20.17,"here, you've been like this allnight."
625,00:38:22.50,00:38:22.50,Occasionally popping your headup.
626,00:38:25.17,00:38:25.17,What's the hardest part aboutthis for you?
627,00:38:27.42,00:38:27.42,">> I am frustrated with losing,is really what I'm frustrated"
628,00:38:30.12,00:38:30.12,about.And I actually do feel like I
629,00:38:32.50,00:38:32.50,have some large responsibilityin these losses.
630,00:38:36.04,00:38:36.04,"You know, today in the puzzle.You know, I feel like Mick did"
631,00:38:39.38,00:38:39.38,a really good job figuring outwhat the pattern was.
632,00:38:41.42,00:38:41.42,"I think Liz had the patterngoing, but I just couldn't"
633,00:38:44.04,00:38:44.04,"figure out how to see thepattern at my end, and so, I"
634,00:38:48.71,00:38:48.71,don't feel like I performed ata level at which I should have.
635,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,>> PROBST: So if you're votedout tonight based on today's
636,00:38:55.58,00:38:55.58,"performance, would it be fair?>> If they decide that, you"
637,00:39:01.58,00:39:01.58,"know, my performance todaywarrants me to walk away, I hope"
638,00:39:05.25,00:39:05.25,that that is what is necessaryfor them to win tomorrow.
639,00:39:10.17,00:39:10.17,">> PROBST: All right, it istime to vote."
640,00:39:12.75,00:39:12.75,"Mick, you're up.>> This is totally strategic"
641,00:39:26.75,00:39:26.75,and not at all personal.Sorry.
642,00:39:50.00,00:39:50.00,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
643,00:40:03.21,00:40:03.21,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
644,00:40:06.12,00:40:06.12,Person voted out will be askedto leave the Tribal Council area
645,00:40:09.00,00:40:09.00,immediately.I'll read the votes.
646,00:40:13.21,00:40:13.21,First vote-- Jaison.Liz.
647,00:40:20.54,00:40:20.54,"One vote-- Jaison, one vote--Liz."
648,00:40:25.58,00:40:25.58,"Liz.That's two votes Liz, one vote"
649,00:40:28.50,00:40:28.50,Jaison.Sixth person voted out of
650,00:40:33.17,00:40:33.17,Survivor: Samoa-- Liz.That's three. That's enough.
651,00:40:36.17,00:40:36.17,You need to bring me yourtorch.
652,00:40:38.29,00:40:38.29,">> Good luck, guys.>> PROBST: Liz, the tribe has"
653,00:40:47.88,00:40:47.88,spoken.Time for you to go.
654,00:41:00.54,00:41:00.54,"Well, you haven't been verysuccessful at challenges, but"
655,00:41:02.58,00:41:02.58,you're getting really good atblindsides.
656,00:41:04.62,00:41:04.62,"Grab your torches, head back tocamp."
657,00:41:07.08,00:41:07.08,Good night.>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
658,00:41:26.17,00:41:26.17,from our next episode.>> PROBST: Next time on
659,00:41:33.75,00:41:33.75,"Survivor.(indistinct chatter, cheering)"
660,00:41:36.79,00:41:36.79,>> To our new tribe.>> New tribe.
661,00:41:38.79,00:41:38.79,"(whooping)>> All of a sudden, all hell"
662,00:41:40.79,00:41:40.79,breaks loose.>> Monica needs to go home
663,00:41:42.79,00:41:42.79,tonight.>> It's Erik 100%.
664,00:41:48.00,00:41:48.00,>> I got to do what I got to do.Things are going to get crazy
665,00:41:50.00,00:41:50.00,tomorrow out here.>> This experience was...
666,00:41:57.71,00:41:57.71,It was nothing but intense.My tribe mates outwitted me.
667,00:42:01.71,00:42:01.71,"It was a very strategic move,and the tables turned so quickly"
668,00:42:05.42,00:42:05.42,"that, you know, it's a littlebit surprising, but kudos to"
669,00:42:08.25,00:42:08.25,"them.I really, really hope that they"
670,00:42:10.29,00:42:10.29,"make it to the end.And this is one hell of a game,"
671,00:42:13.12,00:42:13.12,so I'm glad I made it as far asI did.
