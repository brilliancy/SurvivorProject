58,00:05:35.42,00:05:35.42,was just the anticipation ofgetting started or the whole
59,00:05:39.00,00:05:39.00,"thing, but I was... really, Iwas moved to tears."

196,00:15:16.42,00:15:16.42,around all night.>> I just wanted to hunker down
197,00:15:19.46,00:15:19.46,"till daylight came so we could,you know, find our camp easier"
198,00:15:22.58,00:15:22.58,and everybody would be safe.I wasn't tired.
199,00:15:24.79,00:15:24.79,I just love to sit and visit.I haven't said anything to

206,00:15:45.79,00:15:45.79,"Like, I think sleeping righthere is, like, the stupidest"
207,00:15:48.67,00:15:48.67,"thing we could possibly do.>> You guys, come on up here!"
208,00:15:51.17,00:15:51.17,>> Come on.>> We want to hang out.

217,00:16:12.25,00:16:12.25,>> It got to a pointwhere we couldn't make a
218,00:16:14.79,00:16:14.79,decision whether we shouldcontinue or go back or if we
219,00:16:17.29,00:16:17.29,"missed the flag, or...We were really kind of afraid"
220,00:16:19.79,00:16:19.79,that we missed camp altogether'cause it's dark out.

585,00:34:51.04,00:34:51.04,about it.They said the weakest link.
586,00:34:53.04,00:34:53.04,They're assuming that I agreethat the weakest link is Chris.
587,00:34:57.71,00:34:57.71,If we're going to stay in this--the old people-- the only way
588,00:35:01.50,00:35:01.50,"we're going get a milliondollars, one of us, is if we get"
