2,00:00:10.00,00:00:10.00,"the rim of Mt. Yasur, a massive crater that displays its anger"
3,00:00:14.08,00:00:14.08,"on a regular basis, spewing molten lava and rock thousands"
4,00:00:18.25,00:00:18.25,of feet into the air. Locals believe this is the final
5,00:00:20.46,00:00:20.46,resting spot for the spirits of the dead.
6,00:00:23.88,00:00:23.88,Yasur is one of nine active volcanoes on the island nation
7,00:00:27.96,00:00:27.96,of Vanuatu in the South Pacific. It is a land with a fascinating
8,00:00:32.21,00:00:32.21,"history of cannibalism, where rituals like sorcery and black"
9,00:00:35.79,00:00:35.79,magic are still a part of daily life.
10,00:00:40.38,00:00:40.38,It is here that 18 Americans are about to begin the adventure of

13,00:00:53.12,00:00:53.12,while battling the elements and each other.
14,00:00:56.08,00:00:56.08,"They must learn to adapt, or they'll be voted out of the"
15,00:00:59.08,00:00:59.08,"tribe. In the end, only one will remain"

21,00:03:15.21,00:03:15.21,>> There he is. >> Thank God.
22,00:03:18.29,00:03:18.29,>> There he is. ( whistling )

24,00:03:27.79,00:03:27.79,Welcome to Survivor: Vanuatu-- Islands of Fire.
25,00:03:31.21,00:03:31.21,"The game is about to begin, but before it does, you have to be"
26,00:03:35.96,00:03:35.96,granted access to the land. So you're going to take part in
27,00:03:40.29,00:03:40.29,a tribal ritual. It is a rite of passage and an
28,00:03:43.96,00:03:43.96,"invitation to stay on the land, but in order to stay, you must"
29,00:03:48.25,00:03:48.25,participate. It's going to impact each of you
30,00:03:51.67,00:03:51.67,"differently. At times, you may find it"
31,00:03:53.50,00:03:53.50,"beautiful. At times, you may be repulsed."
32,00:03:57.04,00:03:57.04,"And at times, you may be frightened."
33,00:04:00.08,00:04:00.08,Chief Mormor will preside over all of this.
34,00:04:03.08,00:04:03.08,"He is a real chief. I will be there, but he will"
35,00:04:05.54,00:04:05.54,guide you through it. The tribes of Vanuatu take their
36,00:04:09.08,00:04:09.08,spirituality very seriously. The ceremony you're going to
37,00:04:13.17,00:04:13.17,take part in is an authentic Vanuatu tribal tradition.
38,00:04:17.17,00:04:17.17,You are in a foreign country. Remember that.
39,00:04:20.92,00:04:20.92,This is their culture. We are only visitors.
40,00:04:24.00,00:04:24.00,It's time to go over. Three in a canoe.
41,00:04:26.12,00:04:26.12,"Down the rope ladder. >> Jeff gave us an overview,"
42,00:04:33.29,00:04:33.29,saying how the customs of Vanuatu are not like we're
43,00:04:37.96,00:04:37.96,"used to, so I was... I was really nervous after he was"
44,00:04:40.92,00:04:40.92,"talking to us. I'm like, ""What are they going"
45,00:04:42.38,00:04:42.38,"to do?"" >> Jeff informed us we're going"
46,00:04:47.54,00:04:47.54,to climb down the side of the boat and we're going to get in
47,00:04:49.75,00:04:49.75,"these canoes. I thought, 'Man, that's great,'"
48,00:04:51.71,00:04:51.71,because I didn't learn how to swim until six weeks before I
49,00:04:55.17,00:04:55.17,come here. I would've been spooked if I
50,00:04:57.17,00:04:57.17,knew I had to swim. ( screaming )
51,00:05:02.17,00:05:02.17,">> We get into the boat, and it tips over, so I'm trying to hold"
52,00:05:06.17,00:05:06.17,"onto the rope to keep me up. It was killing my back, but I"
53,00:05:09.04,00:05:09.04,wasn't about to move again. I was going to stay right where
54,00:05:12.17,00:05:12.17,I was at. We finally got another boat
55,00:05:14.62,00:05:14.62,over there. ( singing )
56,00:05:25.17,00:05:25.17,( chanting ) >> When the natives took
57,00:05:30.04,00:05:30.04,us into the middle of the ring where everybody circled around
58,00:05:33.17,00:05:33.17,"us, it was really overwhelming for me, and I don't know if it"
59,00:05:35.42,00:05:35.42,was just the anticipation of getting started or the whole
60,00:05:39.00,00:05:39.00,"thing, but I was... really, I was moved to tears."
61,00:05:54.79,00:05:54.79,( native people screaming ) >> There was a bunch of
62,00:06:09.88,00:06:09.88,"tribesmen running with spears. My first reaction was, you know,"
63,00:06:13.50,00:06:13.50,"""What's going on?"" We were like, ""Wha-Wha-What?"
64,00:06:16.08,00:06:16.08,Are we suppose to defend ourselves?
65,00:06:17.58,00:06:17.58,"What are we supposed to do?"" >> They're jabbing spears at"
66,00:06:23.92,00:06:23.92,absolutely everybody except me. Nobody jabbed a spear at me in
67,00:06:28.04,00:06:28.04,"any way, shape or form, which I took as, you know, a black man"
68,00:06:31.96,00:06:31.96,coming on the island is not particularly unwelcome.
69,00:06:35.17,00:06:35.17,( singing ) >> These guys in their big
70,00:06:49.00,00:06:49.00,"cone-shaped jungle dresses-- they have these big sticks, and"
71,00:06:51.46,00:06:51.46,"they start, you know, pulling people out with the sticks, but"
72,00:06:54.12,00:06:54.12,"kind of, like, you know, whacking 'em out."
73,00:06:56.21,00:06:56.21,"Soon enough, I noticed that they were bringing the women to one"
74,00:06:59.00,00:06:59.00,"side. We look over, and the guys, you"
75,00:07:02.75,00:07:02.75,"know... Like, we're, like, kneeling on a"
76,00:07:04.29,00:07:04.29,"mat, and they all have, like, little, like, stump seats"
77,00:07:07.50,00:07:07.50,"to sit on. And they're, like, right in the"
78,00:07:09.42,00:07:09.42,center of the action. We're kind of off to the side.
79,00:07:11.46,00:07:11.46,"And so I immediately start thinking, 'What's with this?"
80,00:07:14.08,00:07:14.08,I thought we were all supposed to be part of this ceremony.'
81,00:07:20.79,00:07:20.79,">> They brought a bowl out, and they uncovered the palm"
82,00:07:23.21,00:07:23.21,"leaves off of it, and they were pointing at it."
83,00:07:26.00,00:07:26.00,"Well, I thought maybe I was supposed to wash my fingers or"
84,00:07:28.12,00:07:28.12,"something, you know? Uh, we were getting ready to eat"
85,00:07:30.21,00:07:30.21,"something or-or, uh, wash my fingers, 'cause it was some"
86,00:07:32.38,00:07:32.38,rustic-looking stuff. >> Chief Mormor offers each one
87,00:07:40.17,00:07:40.17,"of us this kava, which is the local drink."
88,00:07:43.25,00:07:43.25,"It's like mud, basically. You drink it."
89,00:07:46.33,00:07:46.33,"Your lips go numb, and your tongue goes numb, and your"
90,00:07:49.46,00:07:49.46,throat goes numb. ( spitting )
91,00:07:54.17,00:07:54.17,"( laughing ) >> The chief is welcoming us,"
92,00:08:00.54,00:08:00.54,"and I look over at the girls, and they're not getting anything"
93,00:08:04.08,00:08:04.08,"to drink. And I'm thinking, 'Wow, this is"
94,00:08:05.92,00:08:05.92,"pretty cool.' You know, special treatment for"
95,00:08:08.46,00:08:08.46,the guys. ( spitting )
96,00:08:15.17,00:08:15.17,">> I was waiting for our turn. I was like, ""Well, okay, well,"
97,00:08:18.17,00:08:18.17,"when do we get kava?"" But it never came around."
98,00:08:21.17,00:08:21.17,We're not getting the full deal here.
99,00:08:24.21,00:08:24.21,I'm not used to being put second behind a man.
100,00:08:50.38,00:08:50.38,( man chanting ) ( men singing in response )
101,00:08:54.12,00:08:54.12,">> PROBST: Keep if mind, guys, what is about to happen next is"
102,00:08:56.17,00:08:56.17,a common part of their tribal tradition.
103,00:09:07.04,00:09:07.04,">> Apparently, the Vanuatu people really honor pigs."
104,00:09:11.96,00:09:11.96,"Pigs are, I think, sometimes better than women."
105,00:09:15.88,00:09:15.88,"Anyway, so, they come in with this pig."
106,00:09:19.12,00:09:19.12,"Right away, I thought, 'Okay, we're having a pig roast,' you"
107,00:09:22.12,00:09:22.12,know? But I thought the pig was dead.
108,00:09:24.42,00:09:24.42,And then I realized the pig was alive.
109,00:09:47.71,00:09:47.71,">> I eat meat, and I know that animals are slaughtered, but,"
110,00:09:50.83,00:09:50.83,"like, seeing it was just like... ( gasps )"
111,00:09:52.96,00:09:52.96,"Like, I-I literally think I gasped out loud, because it was"
112,00:09:55.67,00:09:55.67,just so shocking to watch. >> That kind of stuff doesn't
113,00:10:01.29,00:10:01.29,"bother me, because I'm a shepherdess, and that's"
114,00:10:03.38,00:10:03.38,what I do. I-I raise lambs for that exact
115,00:10:06.54,00:10:06.54,purpose: to slaughter. So I totally understand
116,00:10:10.33,00:10:10.33,that ritual. >> The head chief took the
117,00:10:15.75,00:10:15.75,blood of his sacrifice and went to each male member of
118,00:10:19.08,00:10:19.08,"Survivor-- no, no females-- and said, ""You are now a-a, you"
119,00:10:23.04,00:10:23.04,"know, a warrior in Vanuatu."" And basically, I felt what he"
120,00:10:26.25,00:10:26.25,"was doing was he was saying ""Welcome."""
121,00:10:28.50,00:10:28.50,( cheering ) >> PROBST: There's one element
122,00:10:43.75,00:10:43.75,left to this initiation. It involves a spiritual stone.
123,00:10:48.92,00:10:48.92,It is believed on these lands that this carved stone and other
124,00:10:52.67,00:10:52.67,stones like it ward off evil spirits.
125,00:10:56.12,00:10:56.12,Last thing you want in this game is bad luck.
126,00:10:59.17,00:10:59.17,Possessing this stone could give you a spiritual advantage
127,00:11:02.38,00:11:02.38,"in the game. As you've seen, men and women"
128,00:11:05.46,00:11:05.46,are treated very differently. The chief is offering the men a
129,00:11:09.21,00:11:09.21,chance to possess this stone. The only hitch is you have to
130,00:11:13.54,00:11:13.54,"get it from the top of that pole, which has been greased"
131,00:11:16.33,00:11:16.33,"with pig fat. If you fail, the women get it."
132,00:11:22.58,00:11:22.58,The chief will decide in which order you go.
133,00:11:25.50,00:11:25.50,"To show you that it can be done, he's going to instruct a tribe"
134,00:11:27.96,00:11:27.96,member to take it up and put it there now.
135,00:11:34.17,00:11:34.17,">> Ever who possesses that stone, the spirits are"
136,00:11:37.25,00:11:37.25,supposed to be in favor. Even though that's not my
137,00:11:40.12,00:11:40.12,"beliefs, I still wanted that stone, just so the girls"
138,00:11:42.79,00:11:42.79,wouldn't get it. ( cheering and hooting )
139,00:11:54.08,00:11:54.08,">> We were all going, ""I don't want to be the one that"
140,00:11:56.79,00:11:56.79,"falls flat on my face in front of everybody."""
141,00:12:00.29,00:12:00.29,"The chief turned around, and he pointed in my direction."
142,00:12:03.00,00:12:03.00,"I was like, ""Oh, my God. No, not me."""
143,00:12:04.50,00:12:04.50,And I went like this out of the way.
144,00:12:06.33,00:12:06.33,"I said, ""Yeah, him?"" ( cheering )"
145,00:12:10.08,00:12:10.08,>> I was just praying to God he was going to pick
146,00:12:12.04,00:12:12.04,"somebody else, but he picked me. As soon as he did, I figured the"
147,00:12:15.58,00:12:15.58,only way I'd even have any chance is to do it kind of like
148,00:12:19.12,00:12:19.12,the other guy did it. And I got a little dirt on my
149,00:12:22.12,00:12:22.12,"feet, in my hands. And I just hung on for dear"
150,00:12:25.08,00:12:25.08,life. >> The girls were praying
151,00:12:32.17,00:12:32.17,that the boys were not going to do it.
152,00:12:34.12,00:12:34.12,"So I was like, ""Please fall."" We want to see some of them fall"
153,00:12:37.17,00:12:37.17,at least. ( cheering )
154,00:12:39.46,00:12:39.46,( thunder crashing ) ( cheering )
155,00:12:47.92,00:12:47.92,">> As soon as he got that rock, it started raining"
156,00:12:51.00,00:12:51.00,like pouring pee out of a boot on a flat rock.
157,00:12:53.79,00:12:53.79,"It was definitely spooky, but I didn't care, we got the rock."
158,00:12:58.54,00:12:58.54,"( cheering ) >> Now, it's time to begin"
159,00:13:07.54,00:13:07.54,Survivor. Because you have been divided by
160,00:13:09.42,00:13:09.42,"the chief into groups of men and women, you will stay that way."
161,00:13:13.29,00:13:13.29,"Men in possession of the Spiritual Stone, you are the"
162,00:13:17.00,00:13:17.00,Lopevi Tribe. You will wear red.
163,00:13:20.79,00:13:20.79,>> Men against women. It's perfect.
164,00:13:22.75,00:13:22.75,I can outsmart eight men a hell of a lot quicker than I can
165,00:13:25.33,00:13:25.33,outsmart eight women. Women stick together.
166,00:13:28.46,00:13:28.46,"They're thick as thieves. Men are deceiving, mischievous,"
167,00:13:31.79,00:13:31.79,untrusting human beings. Men-- I can manipulate.
168,00:13:34.62,00:13:34.62,>> PROBST: You are the Yasur Tribe.
169,00:13:38.46,00:13:38.46,Named after the volcano. You will wear yellow.
170,00:13:42.88,00:13:42.88,>> When I found out we was splitting the men and the
171,00:13:45.04,00:13:45.04,"women, I looked around at them little girls and I thought, ""Oh,"
172,00:13:47.62,00:13:47.62,"Lord, what did you get me into?"" We had a couple of ol' prissy"
173,00:13:51.71,00:13:51.71,ones. They probably hadn't even been
174,00:13:53.79,00:13:53.79,dirty in their entire days and they ain't got a clue what's in
175,00:13:57.04,00:13:57.04,store for the next God knows how many days.
176,00:13:59.04,00:13:59.04,>> PROBST: Your next task is to find your tribal beaches.
177,00:14:02.12,00:14:02.12,You will not have a map to guide you.
178,00:14:04.25,00:14:04.25,You will not have fire to lead the way.
179,00:14:07.12,00:14:07.12,"It is going to be a long, dark, wet walk."
180,00:14:12.33,00:14:12.33,"And when you get there, you will have a pot, you will have a"
181,00:14:15.92,00:14:15.92,"machete and you will have a map to water, and that's it."
182,00:14:19.12,00:14:19.12,"Have a good 39 days. Men, down the beach this way."
183,00:14:22.17,00:14:22.17,Keep walking till you find your tribe flag.

187,00:14:33.88,00:14:33.88,we did. I think we definitely got a bum
188,00:14:36.21,00:14:36.21,deal. So we're out for blood now.
189,00:14:39.33,00:14:39.33,"( cheering ) >> Okay, girls."
190,00:14:53.50,00:14:53.50,Be really careful. >> You have to hold on to the
191,00:14:56.71,00:14:56.71,next person. >> This is really slippery roots
192,00:14:58.21,00:14:58.21,"here so be really careful. >> Oh, whoa, Scout."
193,00:15:01.88,00:15:01.88,">> One down, one up. >> Are you okay?"
194,00:15:05.25,00:15:05.25,">> Yeah. >> What do you think, Scout?"
195,00:15:08.12,00:15:08.12,"I'm going with your years of experience and... and, uh, know-"
196,00:15:12.75,00:15:12.75,"how here, because I don't want to... I don't want to walk"
197,00:15:16.42,00:15:16.42,around all night. >> I just wanted to hunker down
198,00:15:19.46,00:15:19.46,"till daylight came so we could, you know, find our camp easier"
199,00:15:22.58,00:15:22.58,and everybody would be safe. I wasn't tired.
200,00:15:24.79,00:15:24.79,I just love to sit and visit. I haven't said anything to
201,00:15:27.79,00:15:27.79,"anybody here, but I'm schlepping around an artificial knee."
202,00:15:31.12,00:15:31.12,So I'm pretty cautious crawling across lava rock that deep at
203,00:15:35.17,00:15:35.17,night with it raining. ( hooting )
204,00:15:38.33,00:15:38.33,>> Yeah? >> Ami and Dolly and Scout
205,00:15:40.92,00:15:40.92,didn't want to come along. They almost insisted on just
206,00:15:43.46,00:15:43.46,"stopping where we were and, you know, sleeping."
207,00:15:45.79,00:15:45.79,"Like, I think sleeping right here is, like, the stupidest"
208,00:15:48.67,00:15:48.67,"thing we could possibly do. >> You guys, come on up here!"
209,00:15:51.17,00:15:51.17,>> Come on. >> We want to hang out.
210,00:15:53.67,00:15:53.67,We want to get to know each other.
211,00:15:55.54,00:15:55.54,>> We want you to come hang out with us.
212,00:15:58.04,00:15:58.04,">> Hey, girls, let's make a group decision."
213,00:16:00.54,00:16:00.54,What way do you want to go? >> I don't want to hold you.
214,00:16:03.21,00:16:03.21,"I want you guys to go at your pace, you know."
215,00:16:05.08,00:16:05.08,"I just, I feel like they're headed the wrong direction, so"
216,00:16:07.12,00:16:07.12,I want you to go on. I'm happy to stay back.
217,00:16:10.08,00:16:10.08,>> Somebody needs to make a decision.
218,00:16:12.25,00:16:12.25,>> It got to a point where we couldn't make a
219,00:16:14.79,00:16:14.79,decision whether we should continue or go back or if we
220,00:16:17.29,00:16:17.29,"missed the flag, or... We were really kind of afraid"
221,00:16:19.79,00:16:19.79,that we missed camp altogether 'cause it's dark out.
222,00:16:23.21,00:16:23.21,>> I really had my heart set on find our camp tonight.
223,00:16:25.33,00:16:25.33,">> Me, too. >> I didn't want to be too pushy"
224,00:16:27.12,00:16:27.12,"because I didn't want to be, like, the odd person out."
225,00:16:29.54,00:16:29.54,>> Are you going to be able to sleep in this rain and cold?
226,00:16:32.21,00:16:32.21,">> No, no, I want to keep walking."
227,00:16:33.83,00:16:33.83,>> We might as well keep walking.
228,00:16:35.54,00:16:35.54,">> Luckily, you know, other people agreed with me"
229,00:16:38.17,00:16:38.17,"that, um, we should continue. Scout, will you come with us"
230,00:16:41.12,00:16:41.12,"if we chose to go, or are you going to...?"
231,00:16:43.54,00:16:43.54,">> Yeah, I'll go with you. >> Come on, girl."
232,00:16:46.17,00:16:46.17,">> Yeah, let's go forward. >> We don't want the guys"
233,00:16:48.58,00:16:48.58,to find their camp before us. ( scattered laughing )
234,00:16:50.62,00:16:50.62,">> I know, I know. >> Whoo!"
235,00:16:58.75,00:16:58.75,>> It's the blind leading the blind here.
236,00:17:01.12,00:17:01.12,">> Where's the flag, bro? >> I don't think nine of"
237,00:17:04.88,00:17:04.88,us would miss it. >> Can we hold on a quick
238,00:17:07.29,00:17:07.29,second? We really need to come up with
239,00:17:10.75,00:17:10.75,some sort of game plan because this walking our path is bull...
240,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,"I mean, we got nine of us. There's got to be a better way"
241,00:17:17.50,00:17:17.50,than this. Now we can keep walking along
242,00:17:19.96,00:17:19.96,"the path, and some of us can walk along the path, but then"
243,00:17:23.21,00:17:23.21,"we passed several trails that are going up, and we have no"
244,00:17:26.25,00:17:26.25,idea where those things are going.
245,00:17:27.58,00:17:27.58,Nine of us walking in a group like a bunch of ladies ain't
246,00:17:30.08,00:17:30.08,"helping. >> Rory, I don't think"
247,00:17:31.54,00:17:31.54,"he's going to fit in. There is one in every bunch, you"
248,00:17:33.46,00:17:33.46,"know what I mean? To see, like, Rory already"
249,00:17:35.58,00:17:35.58,"barking out orders, what is he thinking?"
250,00:17:37.46,00:17:37.46,"I'll be honest with you, the walk is, like, kind of keeping"
251,00:17:40.12,00:17:40.12,"us busy, like, we got something to do, just walk."
252,00:17:42.46,00:17:42.46,"Like, you know what I mean? Once we find camp anyway, what"
253,00:17:44.79,00:17:44.79,are we going to do when we get there anyway?
254,00:17:46.54,00:17:46.54,>> What does the group want to do?
255,00:17:48.04,00:17:48.04,What do we want to do? >> Keep walking?
256,00:17:50.62,00:17:50.62,">> Move on. >> Move out, move out."
257,00:17:53.12,00:17:53.12,>> I don't think there was any independent thought.
258,00:17:55.12,00:17:55.12,I think that we could've covered more ground if we weren't all
259,00:17:57.75,00:17:57.75,walking in a big pack of nine guys all at once.
260,00:18:00.12,00:18:00.12,"Some of the younger guys that... that are here, none of them want"
261,00:18:04.25,00:18:04.25,to listen. They're all young.
262,00:18:05.79,00:18:05.79,>> Little tension on the first night.
263,00:18:08.29,00:18:08.29,( scattered chuckling ) >> What's that right there?
264,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,Does that look like a stick with a flag on it?
265,00:18:18.04,00:18:18.04,"Yo, it's the flag! ( whooping )"
266,00:18:21.25,00:18:21.25,We got the flag! >> Yeah!
267,00:18:26.67,00:18:26.67,( talking excitedly ) >> Let's be real careful.
268,00:18:38.25,00:18:38.25,">> This has got to be it. >> Please be our beach,"
269,00:18:41.46,00:18:41.46,"please be our beach, please be our beach."
270,00:18:45.21,00:18:45.21,>> Yeah! ( whooping and cheering )
271,00:18:48.96,00:18:48.96,"You guys, we did it! ( cheering )"
272,00:18:52.38,00:18:52.38,"We see the flag and, you know, all the trouble, all the"
273,00:18:55.58,00:18:55.58,"conflicts, like, dissolved. We're all hugging and thrilled"
274,00:18:57.96,00:18:57.96,to death that we're here. >> Here's to be persevering
275,00:19:00.33,00:19:00.33,and being strong! ( cheering loudly )
276,00:19:03.62,00:19:03.62,"( whooping ) >> Okay, now what?"
277,00:19:07.12,00:19:07.12,( scattered laughing ) >> Should we bring the rest
278,00:19:20.75,00:19:20.75,of the fronds over? >> I think now let's pull in
279,00:19:23.54,00:19:23.54,what we got and see and then tie 'em down.
280,00:19:25.62,00:19:25.62,You got to tie all these up to that center piece.
281,00:19:28.17,00:19:28.17,"Boy, we've got a really sturdy rack for a shelter."
282,00:19:31.17,00:19:31.17,"It's been a group effort. I've stayed with it, and Twila"
283,00:19:33.50,00:19:33.50,"has stayed with it, and, uh, Leann stayed with it."
284,00:19:37.12,00:19:37.12,But some of the gals are down there on the beach basking in
285,00:19:40.33,00:19:40.33,"the sun, chitchatting. >> Oh, praise the spirit"
286,00:19:45.75,00:19:45.75,for the sun. >> Rub it on.
287,00:19:48.42,00:19:48.42,">> It's scrub, deodorant. Shampoo."
288,00:19:51.79,00:19:51.79,">> I call all these sorority girls ""bowheads."""
289,00:19:54.54,00:19:54.54,That's what we call them back in Oklahoma.
290,00:19:56.83,00:19:56.83,They all like to hang together. They're like cattle.
291,00:19:59.17,00:19:59.17,"I mean, really, cows, they just cluster."
292,00:20:01.54,00:20:01.54,"And those sorority chicks, they aren't paying attention to any"
293,00:20:04.04,00:20:04.04,"damn thing but themselves. You know, they're their favorite"
294,00:20:06.17,00:20:06.17,topic. >> I'm really not a
295,00:20:09.83,00:20:09.83,"negative person. Like, I'm awfully optimistic"
296,00:20:11.67,00:20:11.67,"in most cases, but for some reason, I just don't think we're"
297,00:20:14.46,00:20:14.46,"going to get fire from rubbing two, like, quasi dry sticks"
298,00:20:17.54,00:20:17.54,"together. >> Eliza, she talks nonstop."
299,00:20:20.96,00:20:20.96,"She's probably at the top of my list, just to get her mouth out"
300,00:20:24.75,00:20:24.75,of my face. I'm telling you.
301,00:20:26.54,00:20:26.54,">> Dude, are they building shelter right now?"
302,00:20:29.04,00:20:29.04,I don't see them. >> Just lean up against
303,00:20:31.42,00:20:31.42,"this and hold that. Slide down a little bit, though."
304,00:20:35.12,00:20:35.12,( chuckles ) >> Twila has been working
305,00:20:38.17,00:20:38.17,on the shelter constantly. I feel like her continuous work
306,00:20:41.29,00:20:41.29,has made those of us who have taken reasonable breaks look bad
307,00:20:45.54,00:20:45.54,"in her mind to think that, oh, they're not pulling their"
308,00:20:48.62,00:20:48.62,"weight. Hey, ladies, looking great."
309,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,>> We had too much chattering and not enough moving.
310,00:20:52.96,00:20:52.96,Mouths are working but the hands ain't.
311,00:20:55.83,00:20:55.83,The hut still is not done. There is a couple of them that
312,00:20:58.00,00:20:58.00,"didn't do nothing but bitch, moan and complain last night."
313,00:21:00.46,00:21:00.46,"We was all cold. You know, get off your ass, get"

315,00:21:05.08,00:21:05.08,your butt off. >> We know where our
316,00:21:17.08,00:21:17.08,water source is. It's just a little creek with
317,00:21:19.17,00:21:19.17,"some fresh water. It looks really clean, but it's"
318,00:21:21.33,00:21:21.33,"still going to have to be boiled, and... I guess our"
319,00:21:24.83,00:21:24.83,problem right now is we just got to get a fire going.
320,00:21:28.62,00:21:28.62,">> Hey, you guys, before we  start the fire, let's"
321,00:21:30.71,00:21:30.71,"get the, uh, let's get the Immunity Rock, huh?"
322,00:21:33.54,00:21:33.54,Rub the rock's head. >> Fire.
323,00:21:36.38,00:21:36.38,">> Well, you know, it worked at home when I did this."
324,00:21:39.17,00:21:39.17,You make a little notch in this fire tray and put the ball of
325,00:21:42.33,00:21:42.33,"tinder right in here. On the opposite side, you make a"
326,00:21:44.62,00:21:44.62,"groove. The Aborigines did this, why"
327,00:21:49.42,00:21:49.42,can't we? >> J.P. wants to prove himself
328,00:21:51.58,00:21:51.58,"bad. He's about 30 years old, and"
329,00:21:53.83,00:21:53.83,"he's feeling like, you know, I'm buff, I'm bad, I'm young, I'm"

333,00:22:04.71,00:22:04.71,">> Yup, there you go, dude. Keep it going."
334,00:22:08.12,00:22:08.12,>> Yup. >> This is going to be it.
335,00:22:10.12,00:22:10.12,"Keep going. >> Ton of smoke, ton of smoke."
336,00:22:11.88,00:22:11.88,">> We need more smoke, more smoke, dude."
337,00:22:13.67,00:22:13.67,( grunting ) >> Dump it...
338,00:22:14.96,00:22:14.96,Blow it... >> It's here...
339,00:22:16.17,00:22:16.17,"It's right here, it's right here, it's right here."
340,00:22:18.17,00:22:18.17,">> We actually had a hot ember, which was very pink."
341,00:22:22.71,00:22:22.71,">> Oh, you're getting it. >> Yeah, that's it."
342,00:22:25.08,00:22:25.08,">> Just go, go, go. >> Easy, easy..."
343,00:22:26.88,00:22:26.88,">> I think we were all excited to see a hot ember, but none of"
344,00:22:30.17,00:22:30.17,"us knew what to do with it. We were just kind of like,"
345,00:22:32.88,00:22:32.88,"""Yeah, we've got ember."" No."
346,00:22:34.17,00:22:34.17,>> No! >> We were so close to
347,00:22:36.17,00:22:36.17,getting fire going that I thought we were gonna be
348,00:22:39.29,00:22:39.29,able to boil water. Didn't work.
349,00:22:44.21,00:22:44.21,>> You got those leaves? >> You guys check it out.
350,00:22:46.12,00:22:46.12,I got to... I got to show you this.
351,00:22:47.50,00:22:47.50,>> There's one more right now. >> You guys agree that I
352,00:22:49.92,00:22:49.92,"had a pretty good run down here, I didn't fall or anything?"
353,00:23:08.33,00:23:08.33,">> After doing things that are physically demanding, I felt"
354,00:23:12.12,00:23:12.12,like it was the right time to-to reveal the fact that I have no
355,00:23:16.04,00:23:16.04,"foot, that it's a prosthesis. They were pretty surprised."
356,00:23:19.25,00:23:19.25,It's a rare form of cancer called synovial sarcoma.
357,00:23:21.75,00:23:21.75,"And I just had a little, uh, bump in the bottom of my foot..."
358,00:23:24.88,00:23:24.88,>> Dude. >> ...and thought it was
359,00:23:27.00,00:23:27.00,nothing. I thought it was a cyst.
360,00:23:28.67,00:23:28.67,"I lost it about 20 months ago. >> Dude, it's inspirational"
361,00:23:31.75,00:23:31.75,that you're here. It's awesome.
362,00:23:33.21,00:23:33.21,>> Yeah. >> I know.
363,00:23:34.12,00:23:34.12,">> Good on you, mate. >> I had absolutely no"
364,00:23:37.25,00:23:37.25,"idea that Chad had no leg. I mean, he had..."
365,00:23:39.58,00:23:39.58,"He was wearing pants the whole day, so he just goes, ""Hey,"
366,00:23:42.25,00:23:42.25,"guys, look."" And then he unzippered his"
367,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,"pants, and there was no leg. It was pretty..."
368,00:23:46.25,00:23:46.25,"It was pretty shocking. >> It's, uh..."
369,00:23:48.17,00:23:48.17,">> Extremely mobile, man. You did a hell of a job with it."
370,00:23:51.04,00:23:51.04,">> Well, I try. >> Great."
371,00:23:53.17,00:23:53.17,The guy with the mechanical leg's gonna win for sure.
372,00:23:55.96,00:23:55.96,"He's nice, he's smart, he's quiet, and he... you know, he's"

564,00:33:35.04,00:33:35.04,I'm not real good at balance. ( laughter )
565,00:33:38.00,00:33:38.00,>> Chris couldn't get across the balance beam.
566,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,"The fact is, he didn't make it, and we lost."
567,00:33:43.96,00:33:43.96,>> I'd get halfway and hit a wall.
568,00:33:46.04,00:33:46.04,I really wanted to make it across the beam.
569,00:33:48.04,00:33:48.04,"You know, if I had wings, I'd have made it."
570,00:33:50.17,00:33:50.17,"You know, I would have made myself go across the beam."
571,00:33:52.50,00:33:52.50,"This game, you outwit, outplay, outlast people."
572,00:33:56.67,00:33:56.67,You don't out-balance them. >> It has to be.
573,00:34:12.54,00:34:12.54,You know what I'm saying? >> I totally agree.
574,00:34:15.04,00:34:15.04,">> We have to win this game. >> Lea, what do you think... who"
575,00:34:20.75,00:34:20.75,"are you leaning towards tonight? We're just talking, as a group,"
576,00:34:23.04,00:34:23.04,"we want to be a strong group. >> Bottom line is, I"
577,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,"want to beat those girls, and I want to keep getting immunity."
578,00:34:28.62,00:34:28.62,"The way I'm going to do it is, it's basically the weakest link."
579,00:34:31.71,00:34:31.71,>> I'm going to give it a few hours and see what the
580,00:34:33.88,00:34:33.88,"attitudes are, 'cause, I mean, I like everybody."
581,00:34:36.67,00:34:36.67,>> That's the thing. >> I don't have no bad
582,00:34:39.75,00:34:39.75,"quarrels with nobody. J.P., Brady, John and Brook--"
583,00:34:43.58,00:34:43.58,"they basically said, ""Sarge, we need to get rid of the"
584,00:34:46.21,00:34:46.21,"weakest link."" It's tricky to decide who I'm"
585,00:34:49.38,00:34:49.38,going to vote for. I said I'm going to think
586,00:34:51.04,00:34:51.04,about it. They said the weakest link.
587,00:34:53.04,00:34:53.04,They're assuming that I agree that the weakest link is Chris.
588,00:34:57.71,00:34:57.71,If we're going to stay in this-- the old people-- the only way
589,00:35:01.50,00:35:01.50,"we're going get a million dollars, one of us, is if we get"
590,00:35:04.04,00:35:04.04,rid of the young people. >> But J.P. is the only one that
591,00:35:13.29,00:35:13.29,really is trying to make fire. I'd say Brook.
592,00:35:16.21,00:35:16.21,"Brook is cocky, and we don't know where he lies."
593,00:35:19.12,00:35:19.12,>> I'll talk to Chad. I prepared to come here
594,00:35:22.25,00:35:22.25,"mentally, and I prepared to play the game."
595,00:35:24.71,00:35:24.71,I'm not vulnerable at all. We got a plan.
596,00:35:30.25,00:35:30.25,>> I'm just trying to survive the first couple days.
597,00:35:32.25,00:35:32.25,>> The one thing you got to worry about is you never know.
598,00:35:35.29,00:35:35.29,"Those guys could smarten up, which I hope they didn't."
599,00:35:37.38,00:35:37.38,"Personally, I think these are all young guys on the team, guys"
600,00:35:39.71,00:35:39.71,are going to be targets. I feel like I am one of the
601,00:35:42.00,00:35:42.00,"stronger, younger guys who's going to be a target."
602,00:35:44.38,00:35:44.38,">> Right now, we're in charge of..."
603,00:35:46.67,00:35:46.67,"As of right now, you know what I mean?"
604,00:35:48.46,00:35:48.46,>> Not necessarily. >> Trust me.
605,00:35:50.46,00:35:50.46,>> Cool. >> You know what I'm saying?
606,00:35:52.92,00:35:52.92,">> All right, cool. I'm down."
607,00:35:55.00,00:35:55.00,">> All right. >> Well, obviously I haven't"
608,00:36:02.83,00:36:02.83,fully made up my mind on who I'm going to vote for yet tonight.
609,00:36:06.08,00:36:06.08,"I'm thinking about Chris right now, but Rory, he's kind of on"
610,00:36:09.79,00:36:09.79,his own sheet of music a lot of the time.
611,00:36:12.12,00:36:12.12,I think maybe some people feel like Rory is maybe not putting
612,00:36:15.29,00:36:15.29,"out as much group effort as some of the other guys, and the group"
613,00:36:19.25,00:36:19.25,right now is where it's all at. >> PROBST: Behind each of you
614,00:36:46.88,00:36:46.88,"guys is a torch. Go ahead and grab a touch,"
615,00:36:48.71,00:36:48.71,"approach a flame and get fire. Because in this game, fire"
616,00:36:52.42,00:36:52.42,"represents your life. As long as your torch has fire,"
617,00:36:55.88,00:36:55.88,"you're still in the game. When your flame is gone,"
618,00:36:57.92,00:36:57.92,so are you. Welcome to your first Tribal
619,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,Council-- definitely not the place you want to be.
620,00:37:07.54,00:37:07.54,Somebody is going to go home as a result of today's loss.
621,00:37:10.54,00:37:10.54,"But before we get to the vote, let's talk about today's"
622,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,challenge. Anybody here willing to admit
623,00:37:15.88,00:37:15.88,"that as they saw Chris fail, fail, fail, that they started"
624,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,"thinking, ""This guy is killing us."""
625,00:37:22.08,00:37:22.08,">> Oh, I mean, yeah. Because it was so easy."
626,00:37:25.79,00:37:25.79,"And I'm saying, ""Come on, bring your big tail across the doggone"
627,00:37:30.21,00:37:30.21,beam. We were ahead; now we're losing.
628,00:37:32.38,00:37:32.38,"All we got to do is build a little fire, blow the torch and"
629,00:37:35.25,00:37:35.25,"win over these females."" >> PROBST: Chris, at any point"
630,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,"while you're trying to cross it, are you also thinking, ""I'm"
631,00:37:42.04,00:37:42.04,"dead, I'm going home tonight""? >> No, I wasn't."
632,00:37:44.33,00:37:44.33,"I wasn't thinking ""I'm going home tonight."""
633,00:37:46.79,00:37:46.79,"I wasn't thinking ""I'm dead."" I don't categorize stuff"
634,00:37:49.12,00:37:49.12,"like that. The first night, Rory, he had"
635,00:37:51.33,00:37:51.33,some ideas. He was getting on people's
636,00:37:53.58,00:37:53.58,nerves. Did I all of a sudden develop an
637,00:37:55.42,00:37:55.42,"opinion about him and think, ""You know what?"
638,00:37:57.92,00:37:57.92,"He's going home the first time I go to Tribal Council."""
639,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,"No, I didn't think that. Everybody's going to help the"
640,00:38:03.25,00:38:03.25,"team some way, sometime down along the line, and that's all I"
641,00:38:06.21,00:38:06.21,"think about. >> PROBST: Rory, how are you"
642,00:38:08.42,00:38:08.42,"fitting in with this group? >> I fit in fabulously well,"
643,00:38:11.38,00:38:11.38,and I love my partners here. We've accepted every single
644,00:38:14.58,00:38:14.58,"thing that's come our way as a family and as a team, and I"
645,00:38:17.92,00:38:17.92,would expect that's the way we're going to continue to
646,00:38:21.17,00:38:21.17,"operate. >> PROBST: J.P., how close are"
647,00:38:23.71,00:38:23.71,you to crisis mode in terms of not having water?
648,00:38:27.21,00:38:27.21,">> We're on red alert. I mean, when you get into this"
649,00:38:30.54,00:38:30.54,"game, you realize, you take a lot of things for granted, and"
650,00:38:34.08,00:38:34.08,water is one of them. You start getting headaches.
651,00:38:36.96,00:38:36.96,You can't get up. You're lethargic.
652,00:38:39.08,00:38:39.08,You start cramping. It's taken a toll on all of us
653,00:38:41.58,00:38:41.58,in some way or another. >> PROBST: Before we get to the
654,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,"vote, there's one other topic we have to bring up."
655,00:38:47.04,00:38:47.04,You got your first look today at the women.
656,00:38:49.12,00:38:49.12,">> Mmm. >> PROBST: Bubba, that was just"
657,00:38:51.71,00:38:51.71,"a little grunt or a groan, or a...?"
658,00:38:53.21,00:38:53.21,">> Jeff, I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times."
659,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,You never underestimate a woman. I knew going into this that
660,00:38:59.38,00:38:59.38,"these women were going to be fighting hard, and I hope now"
661,00:39:02.46,00:39:02.46,"everybody respects these ladies, 'cause they mean business, and"
662,00:39:05.50,00:39:05.50,"they can kick our tail, Jeff. >> PROBST: Brook, anybody you"
663,00:39:08.29,00:39:08.29,wouldn't mind ending up on a tribe with?
664,00:39:10.71,00:39:10.71,">> Yeah, there was a couple girls that had really nice, um,"
665,00:39:13.33,00:39:13.33,"tails, but, uh, I was real impressed with how competitive"
666,00:39:16.12,00:39:16.12,"some of those girls were. It's one thing to expect it, and"
667,00:39:18.71,00:39:18.71,one thing to see those girls shimmying across that beam and
668,00:39:21.29,00:39:21.29,grinding their teeth and screaming and yelling just
669,00:39:23.71,00:39:23.71,'cause they want to beat us so bad.
670,00:39:25.50,00:39:25.50,"But, yeah, I was peeking over quite often when I got a chance."
671,00:39:28.79,00:39:28.79,">> PROBST: J.P., you had to be a little surprised nine women"
672,00:39:31.42,00:39:31.42,"kicked your guys' butt. >> I think as the group,"
673,00:39:34.08,00:39:34.08,"we expected to win. Nine males, Jeff-- there's nine"
674,00:39:36.79,00:39:36.79,of us. We're all brute strong.
675,00:39:39.17,00:39:39.17,We're going to have to come in and play the game a little bit
676,00:39:41.75,00:39:41.75,harder. They just raised the level of
677,00:39:43.33,00:39:43.33,"the game. >> PROBST: With that, it is time"
678,00:39:45.54,00:39:45.54,"to vote. Brook, you're up first."
679,00:39:57.29,00:39:57.29,">> Chris, I'm making this vote to save my own butt, and"
680,00:40:00.62,00:40:00.62,"it's definitely strategy. Good luck, bud."
681,00:40:22.54,00:40:22.54,">> If you get voted off tonight, we'll miss your sage"
682,00:40:25.21,00:40:25.21,"comments around camp. Right now, man, it's all about"
683,00:40:27.96,00:40:27.96,team and winning. >> I'm just playing the
684,00:40:46.25,00:40:46.25,"game, man. I started playing it when I got"
685,00:40:47.79,00:40:47.79,to the beach. It's all part of the game.
686,00:40:57.54,00:40:57.54,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
687,00:41:11.54,00:41:11.54,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
688,00:41:14.21,00:41:14.21,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
689,00:41:16.67,00:41:16.67,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
690,00:41:20.92,00:41:20.92,The first vote. Chris.
691,00:41:27.42,00:41:27.42,Chris. That's two votes Chris.
692,00:41:32.17,00:41:32.17,Rory. Brook.
693,00:41:39.88,00:41:39.88,"Brook. That's two votes Brook, two"

695,00:41:46.92,00:41:46.92,Chris. Brook.
696,00:41:52.46,00:41:52.46,"Three votes Brook, three votes Chris."
697,00:41:55.00,00:41:55.00,One vote Rory. Brook.

702,00:42:35.04,00:42:35.04,Three different tribe members received votes.
703,00:42:38.04,00:42:38.04,"You guys are going back to camp. No water, no fire, 'cause you're"
