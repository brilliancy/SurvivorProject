350,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,"nude cartoon character, but thathelped me so much, because I"
351,00:18:22.67,00:18:22.67,kind of forgot about what I wasmissing.
352,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,">> Ladies, it's my chafingskirt."
353,00:18:27.04,00:18:27.04,>> Okay.(bird singing)
354,00:18:38.71,00:18:38.71,>> There's two reasons I'mreally happy to be out here.
355,00:18:40.88,00:18:40.88,"One, I get to spend some time bymyself and really step away from"
356,00:18:44.08,00:18:44.08,"the game.And, two, I get a chance to look"
357,00:18:47.79,00:18:47.79,"for the immunity idol.Immunity is very important, and"
358,00:18:51.25,00:18:51.25,"the hidden immunity idol is,obviously, clearly, very"
359,00:18:53.62,00:18:53.62,"important, but I just can't seemto wrap my mind around these"
360,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,clues.One of the problems with the
361,00:19:08.21,00:19:08.21,clue is that it says it's undera rock.
362,00:19:10.88,00:19:10.88,"People have moved rocks, so, Idon't know if I'm digging a hole"
363,00:19:14.12,00:19:14.12,"where there is nothing to dig,or I don't know what's going on."
364,00:19:17.29,00:19:17.29,I'm sure a lot of that just hasto do with mental fatigue of
365,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,being out here for days.>> Terry is the person I fear
366,00:19:28.33,00:19:28.33,may have the idol.It would be a real easy move on
367,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,"his part to just send me outhere, knowing I'm his biggest"
368,00:19:34.96,00:19:34.96,"physical competitor, and that,you know, it might weaken me"
369,00:19:38.17,00:19:38.17,physically to be out here.So his quickness to send me
370,00:19:40.67,00:19:40.67,"might suggest that there is noimmunity idol out here, so"
371,00:19:43.08,00:19:43.08,there's no sense in me lookingfor it.
372,00:19:55.46,00:19:55.46,">> Yo, they're home.>> Are we...?"

559,00:32:21.08,00:32:21.08,"tonight, and what I am proposingis getting Bruce on our side and"
560,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,then get somebody else like youto come over and make it a
561,00:32:29.29,00:32:29.29,guaranteed four and then we'llvote the four votes for Aras and
562,00:32:34.12,00:32:34.12,then he'll be gone.>> I can't-- I can't commit to
563,00:32:37.21,00:32:37.21,this at this moment.>> Okay.
564,00:32:39.38,00:32:39.38,Guaranteed final four.>> I would like to align with
565,00:32:42.21,00:32:42.21,Terry because I really want togo up against him in the final

567,00:32:47.08,00:32:47.08,can make a deal...>> It's got to be tonight.
568,00:32:49.12,00:32:49.12,It's got to be tonight withSally.
569,00:32:52.92,00:32:52.92,">> If we do remove Aras, then noone will be able to beat Terry,"
570,00:32:55.96,00:32:55.96,"but then on the other point,Aras is more of a threat than"
571,00:32:59.12,00:32:59.12,Terry because he'd be muchharder to beat in the final two.
572,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,There's no clear-cut way for meto go right now.
573,00:33:05.67,00:33:05.67,I'm really-- I'm still kind ofconfused in my mind.
574,00:33:09.62,00:33:09.62,">> Terry, he's trying to winevery immunity challenge."
575,00:33:12.04,00:33:12.04,You mean to tell me you have anace in the hole and you're gonna

577,00:33:18.21,00:33:18.21,"somebody else?Come on, give me a break."
578,00:33:21.42,00:33:21.42,"I mean, I'll be surprised.He may do it and if he does,"
579,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,that will go down as the worstmove in Survivor history because
580,00:33:28.54,00:33:28.54,then he has to win every singlechallenge.
581,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,"But, hey, I've seen crazierthings happen, so we'll see"
582,00:33:34.38,00:33:34.38,"tonight.>> This is our fire, our life,"
583,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,our journey together.We're so blessed.
584,00:33:45.08,00:33:45.08,>> No answer?>> No answer.
585,00:33:48.04,00:33:48.04,"She's into her fire thing, butshe can't make a decision and"
586,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,"I'm like, ""Make a freakingdecision."""
587,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,"If Courtney does not swaytonight, I may or may not give"
588,00:33:58.58,00:33:58.58,"the immunity idol to Sally.If it has to come into play, it"
589,00:34:02.04,00:34:02.04,will.I feel a little bit of risk
590,00:34:05.33,00:34:05.33,"hanging it out there, but if Icome away tonight with the"
591,00:34:08.50,00:34:08.50,"numbers, then I can sit back anddon't have to win another"
592,00:34:12.21,00:34:12.21,immunity challenge until thefinal three.
593,00:34:35.79,00:34:35.79,>> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe first member of our jury--

601,00:35:05.29,00:35:05.29,"to haunt you?>> First of all, I just would"
602,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,like to say I over-performed atthe challenge today.
603,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,I got almost two cheeseburgersdown with nine fries and almost
604,00:35:13.17,00:35:13.17,"an entire glass of Coke, butthere was a part of me that"
605,00:35:16.08,00:35:16.08,regretted doing that.There was part of me that felt
606,00:35:18.83,00:35:18.83,"like I, for the team, needed toshow up and try to get immunity"
607,00:35:22.29,00:35:22.29,"away from Terry because it'sgoing to be very difficult, but"
608,00:35:25.25,00:35:25.25,I also know that I don't feelin my gut of guts that I needed
609,00:35:29.12,00:35:29.12,"to get immunity today, and Iwas-- I'm starving."
610,00:35:32.42,00:35:32.42,">> PROBST: Sally, got to be alittle frustrating because..."
611,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,">> It's so frustrating.I mean, the people who are"

613,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,"they're secure in that, morepower to them."
614,00:35:45.04,00:35:45.04,"I mean, I didn't for one secondconsider eating that"
615,00:35:47.62,00:35:47.62,cheeseburger today.It was the easiest meal that I
616,00:35:51.08,00:35:51.08,have had to pass up out herejust because I needed that
617,00:35:54.88,00:35:54.88,"immunity today.>> PROBST: Aras, you had to feel"
618,00:35:58.08,00:35:58.08,a little irritated that theresponsibility to win it for
619,00:36:01.42,00:36:01.42,"Casaya came down to one guy.>> Yeah, that was a little bit"
620,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,"disappointing of the Casayafolk, whose heads could possibly"
621,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,be on the chopping block if ahidden immunity idol gets
622,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,played.My head is definitely one of
623,00:36:13.12,00:36:13.12,"those, but more so than that,it's a strategy."
624,00:36:15.79,00:36:15.79,"The quicker that we can getTerry's immunity necklace,"
625,00:36:18.96,00:36:18.96,which-- I call it Terry's 'causehe's the only one who's worn it

627,00:36:24.58,00:36:24.58,"strategy.We didn't, it's over, and so now"
628,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83,"the lay of the land is a lotless safe for myself, but it is"
629,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,"what it is.>> PROBST: Shane, is it talked"
630,00:36:33.83,00:36:33.83,"about, Terry's dominance?>> Yeah, it's absolutely"
631,00:36:37.25,00:36:37.25,"apparent, but it's going to takehim six immunities in a row to"
632,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,win.I don't think it can be done.
633,00:36:43.08,00:36:43.08,"If there's anyone that can doit, it's Terry."
634,00:36:45.21,00:36:45.21,The guy is a 47-year-old beastand we as a group can't really
635,00:36:50.08,00:36:50.08,afford to be eatingcheeseburgers after today.
636,00:36:52.79,00:36:52.79,">> But, regardless, I'm going tocontinue winning immunities"
637,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,whether they like it or not...>> Here we go.

639,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,"If I had five of these in myback pocket, I'd be out there"
640,00:37:01.67,00:37:01.67,"competing, especially againstAras 'cause he's a bad dude and"
641,00:37:03.92,00:37:03.92,I want to go out there and beathim.
642,00:37:06.29,00:37:06.29,">> PROBST: Danielle, Terry said""I'm gonna keep winning them."""
643,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,"You mumbled ""Here we go again."">> 'Cause he always talks about"

645,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,"all about Terry, Terry, Terry,but power to him for being as"
646,00:37:18.42,00:37:18.42,"confident and cocky as he is,but..."

650,00:37:28.58,00:37:28.58,">> Yeah, but I don't think we'recoming off as strongly as Terry"
651,00:37:32.25,00:37:32.25,does.He's a super competitive guy.
652,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,I'm not knocking that and I'mvery competitive as well and...
653,00:37:38.08,00:37:38.08,>> PROBST: Is that part of theproblem-- that you can't beat
654,00:37:41.00,00:37:41.00,"him and it frustrates you?>> I mean, it is frustrating,"
655,00:37:43.29,00:37:43.29,but there's going to be achallenge where Terry can't win.
656,00:37:46.96,00:37:46.96,"I mean, if he keeps winningevery single one, God bless him."

667,00:38:21.21,00:38:21.21,have the immunity necklace.That's my thought.
