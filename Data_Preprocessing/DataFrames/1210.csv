18,00:00:50.42,00:00:50.42,"had to get stuck on the island, I'm glad it was Austin."
19,00:00:53.08,00:00:53.08,I have a little bit more trust built with him.
20,00:00:56.00,00:00:56.00,"Logically, Austin would be, you know, a backup plan."

24,00:01:12.33,00:01:12.33,the pecking order. And if I can get those guys over
25,00:01:15.21,00:01:15.21,"to our side, this will totally swing the game."

35,00:01:44.12,00:01:44.12,made a bold promise to Danielle. >> It's tempting that I could

45,00:02:45.75,00:02:45.75,"which university? >> First, flight school for Navy"
46,00:02:48.62,00:02:48.62,is Pensacola. Then I went to jet training in
47,00:02:51.75,00:02:51.75,"Meridian, Mississippi where you learn to dogfight and drop"
48,00:02:54.12,00:02:54.12,bombs and shoot guns and land on the carrier.

50,00:02:59.08,00:02:59.08,"And then from there you go to, you know, say, Jacksonville for"
51,00:03:02.50,00:03:02.50,"A-7s or F-18s, Whidbey Island for..."
52,00:03:06.71,00:03:06.71,>> He's a retired Naval pilot? >> And I'm already behind the
53,00:03:09.29,00:03:09.29,curve and he slaps nine Gs on our way. (grunts) Wham!
54,00:03:13.42,00:03:13.42,And my head just goes up against the canopy...
55,00:03:15.42,00:03:15.42,>> How is any normal American person supposed to beat a Navy
56,00:03:18.71,00:03:18.71,air fighter pilot dude? >> Maybe he'll break his arm or
57,00:03:22.46,00:03:22.46,something. >> (chuckles): God forbid.
58,00:03:24.42,00:03:24.42,">> Oh, my God, I can't believe you just said that."

61,00:03:35.04,00:03:35.04,">> That's not part of the plan, Terry."
62,00:03:37.12,00:03:37.12,">> All right, then I'm just gonna have to take you to the"

64,00:03:41.25,00:03:41.25,off. >> Tribal Council last night was
65,00:03:47.83,00:03:47.83,kind of a bummer. Austin went home; that was the
66,00:03:51.25,00:03:51.25,"end result, but prior to that, there was a big swing play to"
67,00:03:54.83,00:03:54.83,try to get Danielle to come over by offering her the hidden
68,00:03:58.50,00:03:58.50,"immunity idol, and, uh, she declined."
69,00:04:10.00,00:04:10.00,>> Mm-hmm. >> So now Sally and I are pretty
70,00:04:13.71,00:04:13.71,"much on our own, so my mindset is, I am totally motivated to"
71,00:04:17.54,00:04:17.54,kick their butts at everything that comes down the road.
72,00:04:26.21,00:04:26.21,>> Where's his bag? >> I want to see it.
73,00:04:31.04,00:04:31.04,"Is it something fuzzy? >> Before Austin went home,"
74,00:04:41.83,00:04:41.83,Terry showed me some sort of hidden immunity idol.
75,00:04:45.50,00:04:45.50,"I mean, it was something furry. I mean, he could be making this"
76,00:04:49.21,00:04:49.21,"up and he could have just, I don't know, found, I guess, this"
77,00:04:52.08,00:04:52.08,furry thing out in the woods and could be showing it to me
78,00:04:55.54,00:04:55.54,"pretending like it's the hidden idol, but I don't know."
79,00:04:58.17,00:04:58.17,You have to be careful who you assume has it.
80,00:05:00.54,00:05:00.54,>> I just had a nice long talk with Terry about his time in the
81,00:05:03.42,00:05:03.42,"Navy. >> I mean, it's, like, it's"
82,00:05:05.17,00:05:05.17,pretty cool that we're going up against that guy.
83,00:05:07.33,00:05:07.33,">> (sarcastic): Yeah, really cool."
84,00:05:09.96,00:05:09.96,>> We're gonna take him out. >> All right.
85,00:05:12.12,00:05:12.12,>> He flies planes. He's not...
86,00:05:13.96,00:05:13.96,">> Yeah, but he went to the Naval Academy, dude."
87,00:05:16.08,00:05:16.08,">> He's not an American Gladiator, you know?"
88,00:05:18.29,00:05:18.29,">> This reward challenge, if any of you guys win it and don't"
89,00:05:20.88,00:05:20.88,"take me, send my ass to Exile Island."
90,00:05:23.04,00:05:23.04,>> Sure you want to go? >> I don't know if someone's
91,00:05:30.58,00:05:30.58,"found the hidden immunity idol, and I want to go figure that out"
92,00:05:33.33,00:05:33.33,for myself because I'm absolutely a target going into
93,00:05:36.33,00:05:36.33,"these next Tribal Councils, and I want to be there on that"
94,00:05:41.21,00:05:41.21,island scouring it and see what I can find.
95,00:05:54.83,00:05:54.83,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. How's everybody doing?"
96,00:06:03.54,00:06:03.54,>> Great. >> Marvelous.

100,00:06:13.08,00:06:13.08,"home. >> Oh, no."
101,00:06:15.08,00:06:15.08,>> PROBST: And that's long enough.
102,00:06:16.79,00:06:16.79,"So to whet your appetite for today's challenge, I'm gonna"
103,00:06:19.29,00:06:19.29,give you just a little taste of love from home.

106,00:06:34.88,00:06:34.88,"were here in the flesh. They're not, but they did send"
107,00:06:38.08,00:06:38.08,some videos from home that will hopefully fill your heart a
108,00:06:41.71,00:06:41.71,little bit. This is just a taste of what's
109,00:06:45.88,00:06:45.88,"on your video. Win today's reward challenge,"
110,00:06:48.42,00:06:48.42,and you get to watch the whole thing.
111,00:06:51.38,00:06:51.38,"Terry, this is your wife Trish, your son Danny..."

115,00:07:01.00,00:07:01.00,"It seems like forever. >> Daddy, I really miss you, and"
116,00:07:04.83,00:07:04.83,I want you to come home. I hope you're doing good.
117,00:07:07.75,00:07:07.75,"Outwit, outplay, outlast. I really miss you."
118,00:07:10.83,00:07:10.83,(clapping) >> That was awesome.
119,00:07:14.04,00:07:14.04,">> PROBST: Danielle, here's your whole family."
120,00:07:16.50,00:07:16.50,">> Oh, geez. >> Hi, Danielle."
121,00:07:19.62,00:07:19.62,"I miss you, and I can't wait to see you."
122,00:07:22.33,00:07:22.33,It's not the same around here without you here bothering me.
123,00:07:24.83,00:07:24.83,">> We love you very much and very, very proud of everything"
124,00:07:27.08,00:07:27.08,"you're doing. >> PROBST: Bruce, here's your"
125,00:07:30.67,00:07:30.67,"family. You've got your wife Nancy, your"

136,00:07:58.21,00:07:58.21,she's doing back home without you around?
137,00:08:00.46,00:08:00.46,">> I'm sure she misses my snoring, so she can't sleep"
138,00:08:03.25,00:08:03.25,well. (laughter)
139,00:08:05.38,00:08:05.38,">> PROBST: Courtney, here's your mom Barbara."

143,00:08:17.17,00:08:17.17,and we've got the prayers going. We love you very much.

156,00:08:50.12,00:08:50.12,"sister bought one for him, so we just have fires out there, and"
157,00:08:53.00,00:08:53.00,we'll sit and talk. >> PROBST: Sounds like you have
158,00:08:55.08,00:08:55.08,a strong connection with your dad.
159,00:08:57.04,00:08:57.04,">> I do, so it's really nice to see."

166,00:09:16.96,00:09:16.96,now? Are you wishing you were home?
167,00:09:19.04,00:09:19.04,Are you feeling good 'cause you saw him?
168,00:09:21.29,00:09:21.29,">> We grew up together. You know, I was 21 when I had"
169,00:09:24.04,00:09:24.04,"him. He is my other half, he is my"
170,00:09:26.38,00:09:26.38,"brother, he is my best friend, he is my son, he is my life."
171,00:09:31.71,00:09:31.71,">> PROBST: All right, Sally, here's your mom, dad, you sister"
172,00:09:34.96,00:09:34.96,"and even your dog Darby. >> Hi, Sal."
173,00:09:37.08,00:09:37.08,We're all sitting here in my new place that I can't wait for you
174,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33,"to see. We're all rooting for you, and"

180,00:09:55.62,00:09:55.62,Aw. (laughter)
181,00:09:59.25,00:09:59.25,"I couldn't forget you, Cirie. Here's your son Jared and"

186,00:10:16.25,00:10:16.25,"without you being around here. We miss your laugh, your smile,"
187,00:10:19.29,00:10:19.29,just everything. >> PROBST: Does that make you

287,00:14:41.83,00:14:41.83,(laughs) I can't get it!
288,00:14:44.46,00:14:44.46,">> Courtney, it's right here. >> Pull me down more!"
289,00:14:48.96,00:14:48.96,">> PROBST: Terry, Sally, Bruce, Courtney have one flag left."
290,00:14:52.12,00:14:52.12,(Bruce grunting) >> Come on!
291,00:14:54.21,00:14:54.21,>> Take the... Take your time! Take your time!

295,00:15:06.38,00:15:06.38,">> PROBST: Reward for Courtney, Terry, Bruce and Sally!"
296,00:15:10.12,00:15:10.12,">> Yes! Again, the factor!"
297,00:15:13.25,00:15:13.25,>> Damn. >> Oh.
298,00:15:22.42,00:15:22.42,">> PROBST: Okay, before we get to the rest of the your reward,"
299,00:15:25.00,00:15:25.00,big decision. You're sending one person to
300,00:15:27.17,00:15:27.17,"Exile Island. Is it going to be Danielle,"
301,00:15:30.21,00:15:30.21,"Aras, Cirie or Shane? >> Okay."
302,00:15:36.88,00:15:36.88,>> PROBST: Who's it going to be? >> Aras.
303,00:15:38.62,00:15:38.62,">> PROBST: Aras, get your stuff. The boat's coming to pick you"
304,00:15:41.62,00:15:41.62,"up. >> Bye, Aras."

306,00:15:48.08,00:15:48.08,that the rest of the afternoon doesn't include you.

308,00:15:52.62,00:15:52.62,">> Enjoy your families, guys. >> See you."

310,00:15:57.33,00:15:57.33,fun-- videos and peanut butter and jelly.
311,00:15:59.46,00:15:59.46,Let's go. (indistinct chatter)
312,00:16:23.04,00:16:23.04,(laughter) >> You know what I mean?
313,00:16:25.12,00:16:25.12,"So, let's just... If you're going to lose one,"
314,00:16:27.62,00:16:27.62,let's lose this one. The tapes would have wrecked
315,00:16:29.58,00:16:29.58,"us, dude. >> I know."
316,00:16:31.75,00:16:31.75,>> Shane and Danielle and myself returned to camp.
317,00:16:34.04,00:16:34.04,Shane kind of said this wasn't like the hugest challenge to
318,00:16:36.67,00:16:36.67,"lose, but he was just trying to, uh, kind of lift our spirits."
319,00:16:41.79,00:16:41.79,Yay! Home! >> I have an issue with my
320,00:16:45.75,00:16:45.75,penis. (Cirie laughs)
321,00:16:47.75,00:16:47.75,"I'm so sorry. >> Then, Shane had a medical"
322,00:16:49.58,00:16:49.58,emergency. (Cirie laughs)
323,00:16:51.29,00:16:51.29,">> Oh, something's really going on."
324,00:16:53.17,00:16:53.17,I need you to look at it real quick.
325,00:16:54.83,00:16:54.83,>> (laughing): I don't want to look at it.
326,00:16:56.38,00:16:56.38,>> You're a nurse! >> I know.
327,00:17:02.17,00:17:02.17,">> Can you explain it to me, or do I have to look at it?"
328,00:17:08.04,00:17:08.04,">> Shane has this funky thing going on with his, uh,"
329,00:17:10.75,00:17:10.75,"testicles, to put it nicely. Lucky me, being the only nurse"
330,00:17:16.92,00:17:16.92,"out here, he wanted me to take a look at 'em."
331,00:17:20.21,00:17:20.21,(Cirie laughs) Yay!
332,00:17:23.25,00:17:23.25,>> Don't be laughing. >> All right.
333,00:17:25.17,00:17:25.17,">> Hey, don't laugh. It's a... not a..."
334,00:17:26.83,00:17:26.83,Here. (Cirie laughs)
335,00:17:28.88,00:17:28.88,>> What?! >> That's because it's wet all
336,00:17:35.88,00:17:35.88,the time. Your clothes are moist.
337,00:17:38.00,00:17:38.00,"It's like chafing. You know, like diaper rash on a"
338,00:17:40.46,00:17:40.46,baby? >> Yeah. That's what that is?
339,00:17:43.54,00:17:43.54,>> I tried to be as professional as I could under the
340,00:17:46.75,00:17:46.75,"circumstances, but it was just so hilarious."
341,00:17:50.33,00:17:50.33,(Cirie laughing) >> Is that because I've been
342,00:17:52.42,00:17:52.42,wearing those undies for 23 days?
343,00:17:54.29,00:17:54.29,">> It's a good guess, Shane. >> How do I make that go away?"
344,00:17:57.92,00:17:57.92,>> Can you dry it out? >> What's wrong with him?
345,00:18:02.29,00:18:02.29,">> Just like a little red, and then he's naked."
346,00:18:05.46,00:18:05.46,"Oh, my God. >> Yo."
347,00:18:08.83,00:18:08.83,I'm eating. (Cirie sighs)
348,00:18:10.88,00:18:10.88,>> Can I do a skirt glove? >> No. Do your shirt.
349,00:18:13.12,00:18:13.12,Do your shirt. >> I guess.
350,00:18:15.25,00:18:15.25,">> Shane is like a cartoon character, and now he's like a"
351,00:18:19.17,00:18:19.17,"nude cartoon character, but that helped me so much, because I"
352,00:18:22.67,00:18:22.67,kind of forgot about what I was missing.
353,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,">> Ladies, it's my chafing skirt."
354,00:18:27.04,00:18:27.04,>> Okay. (bird singing)
355,00:18:38.71,00:18:38.71,>> There's two reasons I'm really happy to be out here.
356,00:18:40.88,00:18:40.88,"One, I get to spend some time by myself and really step away from"
357,00:18:44.08,00:18:44.08,"the game. And, two, I get a chance to look"
358,00:18:47.79,00:18:47.79,"for the immunity idol. Immunity is very important, and"
359,00:18:51.25,00:18:51.25,"the hidden immunity idol is, obviously, clearly, very"
360,00:18:53.62,00:18:53.62,"important, but I just can't seem to wrap my mind around these"
361,00:18:56.88,00:18:56.88,clues. One of the problems with the
362,00:19:08.21,00:19:08.21,clue is that it says it's under a rock.
363,00:19:10.88,00:19:10.88,"People have moved rocks, so, I don't know if I'm digging a hole"
364,00:19:14.12,00:19:14.12,"where there is nothing to dig, or I don't know what's going on."
365,00:19:17.29,00:19:17.29,I'm sure a lot of that just has to do with mental fatigue of
366,00:19:20.42,00:19:20.42,being out here for days. >> Terry is the person I fear
367,00:19:28.33,00:19:28.33,may have the idol. It would be a real easy move on
368,00:19:31.12,00:19:31.12,"his part to just send me out here, knowing I'm his biggest"
369,00:19:34.96,00:19:34.96,"physical competitor, and that, you know, it might weaken me"
370,00:19:38.17,00:19:38.17,physically to be out here. So his quickness to send me
371,00:19:40.67,00:19:40.67,"might suggest that there is no immunity idol out here, so"
372,00:19:43.08,00:19:43.08,there's no sense in me looking for it.
373,00:19:55.46,00:19:55.46,">> Yo, they're home. >> Are we...?"
374,00:19:57.08,00:19:57.08,">> Boo, boo, boo. When Sally and the other team"
375,00:20:04.17,00:20:04.17,"that won-- when they came back, I didn't even want to see them."
376,00:20:06.42,00:20:06.42,"I was just kind of like already aggravated that we lost, and the"
377,00:20:09.46,00:20:09.46,"last thing I want to know is how full their bellies are, and how"
378,00:20:12.83,00:20:12.83,great it was to see their families.
379,00:20:15.00,00:20:15.00,">> Oh, you guys got your luxury items, too?"
380,00:20:16.79,00:20:16.79,>> Yeah. >> Hey.
381,00:20:19.29,00:20:19.29,>> You always want to learn how to swing a shovel.
382,00:20:24.12,00:20:24.12,>> You guys get to learn our fire dance.
383,00:20:27.46,00:20:27.46,">> And then, you know, when they walked back in, and they all had"
384,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,"their luxury items, I'm, like, oh, wow, you know, that's a"
385,00:20:33.17,00:20:33.17,"double whammy. >> It's all right, honey."
386,00:20:37.62,00:20:37.62,You can't... You guys won.
387,00:20:39.25,00:20:39.25,You know what I mean? >> I know.
388,00:20:41.12,00:20:41.12,">> You need help, Terry? >> After the food for the soul"
389,00:20:43.25,00:20:43.25,and the heart with the videos came luxury items for us four
390,00:20:46.54,00:20:46.54,members. It was great.
391,00:20:48.62,00:20:48.62,Just kind of hook this in for now.
392,00:20:51.25,00:20:51.25,(Bruce mumbles) Thank you for asking me.
393,00:20:53.21,00:20:53.21,"Both my father-in-law and my father were Korean war vets,"
394,00:20:56.12,00:20:56.12,"and, uh... and they recently passed away, and this was on my"
395,00:21:00.38,00:21:00.38,father-in-law's casket. So in order to honor both my
396,00:21:03.54,00:21:03.54,"father and my father-in-law, going to hang here at, uh,"
397,00:21:07.38,00:21:07.38,"Gitanos for a while, and, uh, hopefully till day 39."
398,00:21:11.08,00:21:11.08,">> What did you guys, what did you bring?"
399,00:21:13.71,00:21:13.71,"Love it! >> Sally brought her journal,"
400,00:21:15.71,00:21:15.71,"Bruce has a sketchbook, and Terry has the American flag, go"
401,00:21:18.12,00:21:18.12,figure. But I thought Courtney's luxury
402,00:21:21.21,00:21:21.21,items were like the coolest. (Courtney laughing)
403,00:21:28.25,00:21:28.25,">> It makes me so happy, you know."
404,00:21:30.04,00:21:30.04,It's a toy for everyone. It's really fun.
405,00:21:32.88,00:21:32.88,"This is, like, my-my joy. >> But it's hard when you're"
406,00:21:35.88,00:21:35.88,"the loser, and everybody is like (laughing): ""I got this!"
407,00:21:39.71,00:21:39.71,"And look what I...!"" Who cares?"
408,00:21:43.17,00:21:43.17,"You know, you want to say, ""Who cares?"
409,00:21:45.17,00:21:45.17,"Get out of here,"" but you can't. It's a game, so you have to"
410,00:21:48.21,00:21:48.21,kind of keep it together. (birds screeching)
411,00:22:21.08,00:22:21.08,">> Then it's up to you to either get Courtney, Danielle,"
412,00:22:24.25,00:22:24.25,or Cirie to come over and one of us would have to win the
413,00:22:28.25,00:22:28.25,next challenge. That way we could share the
414,00:22:30.12,00:22:30.12,"hidden immunity idol, and we would have numbers."
415,00:22:33.54,00:22:33.54,>> There are currently six ex-Casaya members that are
416,00:22:37.79,00:22:37.79,"staying loyal and true to each other, versus Terry and I, the"
417,00:22:40.58,00:22:40.58,two ex-La Mina members who are left.
418,00:22:45.75,00:22:45.75,"Like, what if we said to, like, Danielle or Courtney or whoever,"
419,00:22:49.21,00:22:49.21,"say, like, you or I won the next immunity, and we said, we're"
420,00:22:53.21,00:22:53.21,"going to play that thing tonight, so you better jump on"
421,00:22:56.67,00:22:56.67,"now. >> You know, we could play the"
422,00:22:58.54,00:22:58.54,"hidden immunity idol, and we could, you know, one of us will"
423,00:23:01.25,00:23:01.25,be immune. So one of you are going home.
424,00:23:05.21,00:23:05.21,">> If Terry or I win immunity today, and Terry decides that"
425,00:23:09.08,00:23:09.08,"he wants to play the hidden immunity idol, one of the other"
426,00:23:11.62,00:23:11.62,six ex-Casaya members will go home tonight.
427,00:23:15.21,00:23:15.21,"Because the immunity idol can be used after the vote is made,"
428,00:23:18.04,00:23:18.04,which means we would all have to show our cards and then the next
429,00:23:21.33,00:23:21.33,"person who has the most votes would get kicked off, and so I"
430,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,have a lot of hope that things could change today in this game.
431,00:23:28.50,00:23:28.50,>> What do we have to do other than beat you at immunity?
432,00:23:32.21,00:23:32.21,"Do you know of anything? >> I don't know, you better not"
433,00:23:34.62,00:23:34.62,think about anything else. >> How about this: if you don't
434,00:23:37.00,00:23:37.00,"win immunity, and you don't have that silly idol from that"
435,00:23:40.12,00:23:40.12,"goofy island, you're gone. >> Yeah, well, you never know."
436,00:23:54.08,00:23:54.08,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Hello."
437,00:24:03.21,00:24:03.21,>> Good morning. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in
438,00:24:05.50,00:24:05.50,"Aras, returning from Exile Island."
439,00:24:10.67,00:24:10.67,">> Morning, beast. >> Hey."
440,00:24:13.08,00:24:13.08,">> What's up, fellas? (applause)"
441,00:24:15.38,00:24:15.38,>> A day and a half of meditation never hurt nobody.
442,00:24:18.17,00:24:18.17,">> Brucey. >> PROBST: Aras, two days out"
443,00:24:20.38,00:24:20.38,there. How was it?
444,00:24:22.29,00:24:22.29,">> It was surprisingly nice. I made fire, like, the first"
445,00:24:24.92,00:24:24.92,"three minutes. I ate a lot, I hydrated myself"
446,00:24:27.25,00:24:27.25,really well. I got a little time for myself
447,00:24:30.08,00:24:30.08,and a little time to look for the idol.
448,00:24:32.50,00:24:32.50,">> PROBST: So overall, Exile Island was not that bad?"
449,00:24:34.83,00:24:34.83,">> No, but I don't know if I'd want to go right back."
450,00:24:38.08,00:24:38.08,">> PROBST: All right, before we get to the challenge, I'm going"
451,00:24:40.08,00:24:40.08,to hand each of you a nut and a shell.
452,00:24:46.17,00:24:46.17,"Without conferring with anybody, put the shell in one hand, put"
453,00:24:49.50,00:24:49.50,the nut in the other hand. I'll explain how these come
454,00:24:53.21,00:24:53.21,into play in a minute. And I'll take the immunity
455,00:24:57.17,00:24:57.17,"necklace from you. Immunity, once again back up"
456,00:25:01.54,00:25:01.54,"for grabs. For today's challenge, this is"
457,00:25:03.88,00:25:03.88,how it works: sitting on the ocean floor is a long plank
458,00:25:07.62,00:25:07.62,"with seven symbols on it. On my ""go,"" you're going to"
459,00:25:10.21,00:25:10.21,"swim out, memorize as many of those symbols, in order, as you"
460,00:25:13.12,00:25:13.12,"can, then race back to the beach where you will attempt to"
461,00:25:16.58,00:25:16.58,replicate those symbols in the same order on your answer board.
462,00:25:20.83,00:25:20.83,"The first person to solves it correctly, wins immunity,"
463,00:25:23.71,00:25:23.71,guaranteed a one in seven shot at $1 million.
464,00:25:28.04,00:25:28.04,"Losers, Tribal Council tonight, and for one of you, this game"
465,00:25:30.96,00:25:30.96,"will come to an end. Now, there's a twist to today's"
466,00:25:34.00,00:25:34.00,"challenge: if immunity is just not that important to you, you"
467,00:25:38.50,00:25:38.50,don't have to take part in today's challenge.
468,00:25:41.04,00:25:41.04,"Instead, you can chow down... >> Oh!"
469,00:25:47.42,00:25:47.42,">> PROBST: ...on cheeseburgers, French fries..."
470,00:25:49.79,00:25:49.79,>> Me. >> PROBST: ...and soft drinks.
471,00:25:52.21,00:25:52.21,"You can eat for as long as the challenge goes, or until the"
472,00:25:55.62,00:25:55.62,"food runs out. Put the shell in one hand, put"
473,00:25:58.58,00:25:58.58,the nut in the other hand. When I tell you to reveal if
474,00:26:02.08,00:26:02.08,"you want to take part in the challenge, you will show me the"
475,00:26:05.25,00:26:05.25,shell. If instead you want to eat
476,00:26:07.38,00:26:07.38,"food, you'll show me the nut. Three, two, one, reveal."
477,00:26:12.04,00:26:12.04,"Okay, Aras is going to take part in the challenge."
478,00:26:15.29,00:26:15.29,Sally is taking part in the challenge.
479,00:26:17.79,00:26:17.79,Terry is taking part in the challenge.
480,00:26:20.42,00:26:20.42,"Bruce, Cirie, Courtney, Shane, and Danielle are all saying, ""I"
481,00:26:24.21,00:26:24.21,"don't need immunity. I'm going to eat."""
482,00:26:26.54,00:26:26.54,You five take a spot on the picnic table.
483,00:26:29.12,00:26:29.12,"The other three, down here at the answer booth."
484,00:26:32.04,00:26:32.04,">> Aras, it's all you. >> Yeah."
485,00:26:38.17,00:26:38.17,">> PROBST: All right, it's Terry Aras, and Sally fighting for"
486,00:26:41.04,00:26:41.04,"immunity while Shane, Danielle, Courtney, Cirie, and Bruce chow"
487,00:26:45.38,00:26:45.38,"down and enjoy the show. Survivors, ready?"
488,00:26:52.25,00:26:52.25,"Go! Got to swim out, memorize the"
489,00:26:58.29,00:26:58.29,"symbols in order. Shane digging in, Danielle"
490,00:27:01.50,00:27:01.50,digging in. Cirie already got a bite.
491,00:27:04.04,00:27:04.04,Bruce not waste any time. We have two challenges going on.
492,00:27:07.25,00:27:07.25,How much food can you get down before somebody wins immunity?
493,00:27:12.17,00:27:12.17,Terry going down. Aras taking a dip to look.
494,00:27:18.58,00:27:18.58,"Sally taking a dip to look. A lot of French fries, a lot of"
495,00:27:23.88,00:27:23.88,cheeseburgers. Terry thinks he has it
496,00:27:37.29,00:27:37.29,memorized. He's coming back.
497,00:27:39.12,00:27:39.12,">> Oh, no. >> PROBST: Aras heading back."
498,00:27:41.58,00:27:41.58,Sally still working on it. Five very secure people chowing
499,00:27:48.62,00:27:48.62,down. Terry first back.
500,00:27:52.04,00:27:52.04,He's going to give a go. Aras right behind him.
501,00:27:54.62,00:27:54.62,Sally heading back. You're looking to get all seven
502,00:27:59.79,00:27:59.79,"symbols in the same order. >> Go, Sally!"
503,00:28:04.54,00:28:04.54,>> PROBST: Sally making her way back.
504,00:28:12.50,00:28:12.50,Sally trying to work hers out up top before she commits.
505,00:28:19.08,00:28:19.08,">> Take your time, guys. >> PROBST: Who's on their second"
506,00:28:23.12,00:28:23.12,burger? Shane and Cirie.
507,00:28:25.67,00:28:25.67,Bruce on his second burger. Terry working it out.
508,00:28:32.42,00:28:32.42,Immunity on the line. No.
509,00:28:42.75,00:28:42.75,Aras doesn't have it. Aras swimming back out for
510,00:28:45.92,00:28:45.92,another look. >> Here you go.
511,00:28:48.00,00:28:48.00,>> PROBST: Terry thinks he has  it.
512,00:28:49.92,00:28:49.92,">> Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. >> PROBST: Terry wins immunity"
513,00:28:57.42,00:28:57.42,"for the third straight time! >> Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
514,00:28:59.21,00:28:59.21,Yes...! Yes!
515,00:29:03.04,00:29:03.04,>> PROBST: Stop eating. Put it down.
516,00:29:05.25,00:29:05.25,"Put it down, guys. Terry, come on over."
517,00:29:23.04,00:29:23.04,"For the third straight time, individual immunity."
518,00:29:26.96,00:29:26.96,"You're safe at Tribal Council. With this around your neck, you"
519,00:29:29.29,00:29:29.29,"cannot be voted out. For the other seven of you,"
520,00:29:31.71,00:29:31.71,"after 24 days, tonight, this game will come to an end for one"
521,00:29:35.71,00:29:35.71,of you. Head on back to camp.
522,00:29:38.12,00:29:38.12,See you at Tribal. (laughing quietly)
523,00:30:02.12,00:30:02.12,">> Did you get the clue? >> Yeah, I got the clue."
524,00:30:04.46,00:30:04.46,"But it's hard to find. >> Oh, really?"
525,00:30:06.62,00:30:06.62,">> No, no, there are two choices."
526,00:30:08.29,00:30:08.29,Either it was really easy to find and he got it right away.
527,00:30:12.50,00:30:12.50,">> Oh, right. >> Or... or no one's got it."
528,00:30:14.29,00:30:14.29,">> So, we vote Sally, 6-0 tonight..."
529,00:30:17.50,00:30:17.50,>> Okay. >> ...and hope to God he
530,00:30:19.75,00:30:19.75,doesn't have it? >> Yeah.
531,00:30:22.25,00:30:22.25,Thanks for standing up for Casaya.
532,00:30:24.67,00:30:24.67,">> I should have won it. Today's immunity challenge,"
533,00:30:27.42,00:30:27.42,anybody who wanted to not participate in the challenge
534,00:30:29.46,00:30:29.46,could sit and have cheeseburgers.
535,00:30:32.58,00:30:32.58,"There was no question what I was going to do, because it's"
536,00:30:35.54,00:30:35.54,very possible that I could go home today.
537,00:30:39.75,00:30:39.75,"If Sally ends up having the hidden immunity idol, then"
538,00:30:42.38,00:30:42.38,Sally and Terry's vote will knock somebody out.
539,00:31:07.04,00:31:07.04,>> I think Terry just showed the hidden immunity idol.
540,00:31:12.17,00:31:12.17,"Until this moment, I really was kind of questionable about him"
541,00:31:16.21,00:31:16.21,"having the immunity idol, but I believe that is the immunity"
542,00:31:18.83,00:31:18.83,"idol, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens tonight."
543,00:31:23.58,00:31:23.58,>> Tonight... if two of you said we will vote with you...
544,00:31:29.62,00:31:29.62,>> Aras. >> If two of us would vote with
545,00:31:33.17,00:31:33.17,you guys... >> The goal was to get two
546,00:31:35.46,00:31:35.46,"people, so it would be Terry, myself, and two others."
547,00:31:38.42,00:31:38.42,"It'd be four against four, we'd have the idol, we'd play it, and"
548,00:31:41.67,00:31:41.67,what he wants to see happen is us break up 'cause it's going to
549,00:31:45.54,00:31:45.54,"happen anyway, so he's like, ""Why don't a couple of you want"
550,00:31:48.71,00:31:48.71,"to guarantee yourself a spot in the final four?"""
551,00:31:52.67,00:31:52.67,I'm giving everybody in camp the impression that the hidden
552,00:31:55.33,00:31:55.33,immunity idol will be played tonight.
553,00:31:58.00,00:31:58.00,Terry may decide that it isn't worth giving up the idol at this
554,00:32:01.04,00:32:01.04,"point, but it's most advantageous for us to break up"
555,00:32:04.38,00:32:04.38,this strong six as soon as possible and watch them unravel
556,00:32:07.67,00:32:07.67,"and watch them scurry a bit. Otherwise, I'm gone."
557,00:32:13.83,00:32:13.83,>> You're saying that you're giving your immunity idol to
558,00:32:15.92,00:32:15.92,Sally? >> I'm not saying I have it.
559,00:32:18.33,00:32:18.33,I'm just saying it's out there and it could be put in play
560,00:32:21.08,00:32:21.08,"tonight, and what I am proposing is getting Bruce on our side and"
561,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,then get somebody else like you to come over and make it a
562,00:32:29.29,00:32:29.29,guaranteed four and then we'll vote the four votes for Aras and
563,00:32:34.12,00:32:34.12,then he'll be gone. >> I can't-- I can't commit to
564,00:32:37.21,00:32:37.21,this at this moment. >> Okay.
565,00:32:39.38,00:32:39.38,Guaranteed final four. >> I would like to align with
566,00:32:42.21,00:32:42.21,Terry because I really want to go up against him in the final
567,00:32:45.04,00:32:45.04,"two. If, further down the line, we"
568,00:32:47.08,00:32:47.08,can make a deal... >> It's got to be tonight.
569,00:32:49.12,00:32:49.12,It's got to be tonight with Sally.
570,00:32:52.92,00:32:52.92,">> If we do remove Aras, then no one will be able to beat Terry,"
571,00:32:55.96,00:32:55.96,"but then on the other point, Aras is more of a threat than"
572,00:32:59.12,00:32:59.12,Terry because he'd be much harder to beat in the final two.
573,00:33:03.08,00:33:03.08,There's no clear-cut way for me to go right now.
574,00:33:05.67,00:33:05.67,I'm really-- I'm still kind of confused in my mind.
575,00:33:09.62,00:33:09.62,">> Terry, he's trying to win every immunity challenge."
576,00:33:12.04,00:33:12.04,You mean to tell me you have an ace in the hole and you're gonna
577,00:33:15.17,00:33:15.17,"just hand that over, because you're such a nice person, to"
578,00:33:18.21,00:33:18.21,"somebody else? Come on, give me a break."
579,00:33:21.42,00:33:21.42,"I mean, I'll be surprised. He may do it and if he does,"
580,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,that will go down as the worst move in Survivor history because
581,00:33:28.54,00:33:28.54,then he has to win every single challenge.
582,00:33:31.33,00:33:31.33,"But, hey, I've seen crazier things happen, so we'll see"
583,00:33:34.38,00:33:34.38,"tonight. >> This is our fire, our life,"
584,00:33:41.08,00:33:41.08,our journey together. We're so blessed.
585,00:33:45.08,00:33:45.08,>> No answer? >> No answer.
586,00:33:48.04,00:33:48.04,"She's into her fire thing, but she can't make a decision and"
587,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,"I'm like, ""Make a freaking decision."""
588,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,"If Courtney does not sway tonight, I may or may not give"
589,00:33:58.58,00:33:58.58,"the immunity idol to Sally. If it has to come into play, it"
590,00:34:02.04,00:34:02.04,will. I feel a little bit of risk
591,00:34:05.33,00:34:05.33,"hanging it out there, but if I come away tonight with the"
592,00:34:08.50,00:34:08.50,"numbers, then I can sit back and don't have to win another"
593,00:34:12.21,00:34:12.21,immunity challenge until the final three.
594,00:34:35.79,00:34:35.79,>> PROBST: We'll now bring in the first member of our jury--
595,00:34:40.42,00:34:40.42,"Austin, voted out at the last Tribal Council."
596,00:34:43.25,00:34:43.25,(laughter) >> Wow.
597,00:34:50.04,00:34:50.04,">> PROBST: Okay, today's immunity challenge."
598,00:34:52.50,00:34:52.50,You were given a very simple option-- participate or feast--
599,00:34:56.04,00:34:56.04,"and no sooner did I get ""cheeseburger"" out of my mouth,"
600,00:34:58.71,00:34:58.71,"five of you guys are like, ""I'm eating, I'm eating, I'm eating."""
601,00:35:02.25,00:35:02.25,"Shane, worried at all that that bold of a move could come back"
602,00:35:05.29,00:35:05.29,"to haunt you? >> First of all, I just would"
603,00:35:07.88,00:35:07.88,like to say I over-performed at the challenge today.
604,00:35:10.21,00:35:10.21,I got almost two cheeseburgers down with nine fries and almost
605,00:35:13.17,00:35:13.17,"an entire glass of Coke, but there was a part of me that"
606,00:35:16.08,00:35:16.08,regretted doing that. There was part of me that felt
607,00:35:18.83,00:35:18.83,"like I, for the team, needed to show up and try to get immunity"
608,00:35:22.29,00:35:22.29,"away from Terry because it's going to be very difficult, but"
609,00:35:25.25,00:35:25.25,I also know that I don't feel in my gut of guts that I needed
610,00:35:29.12,00:35:29.12,"to get immunity today, and I was-- I'm starving."
611,00:35:32.42,00:35:32.42,">> PROBST: Sally, got to be a little frustrating because..."
612,00:35:35.42,00:35:35.42,">> It's so frustrating. I mean, the people who are"
613,00:35:38.75,00:35:38.75,"confident in this game get to be confident and, you know what, if"
614,00:35:42.67,00:35:42.67,"they're secure in that, more power to them."
615,00:35:45.04,00:35:45.04,"I mean, I didn't for one second consider eating that"
616,00:35:47.62,00:35:47.62,cheeseburger today. It was the easiest meal that I
617,00:35:51.08,00:35:51.08,have had to pass up out here just because I needed that
618,00:35:54.88,00:35:54.88,"immunity today. >> PROBST: Aras, you had to feel"
619,00:35:58.08,00:35:58.08,a little irritated that the responsibility to win it for
620,00:36:01.42,00:36:01.42,"Casaya came down to one guy. >> Yeah, that was a little bit"
621,00:36:05.12,00:36:05.12,"disappointing of the Casaya folk, whose heads could possibly"
622,00:36:08.17,00:36:08.17,be on the chopping block if a hidden immunity idol gets
623,00:36:10.83,00:36:10.83,played. My head is definitely one of
624,00:36:13.12,00:36:13.12,"those, but more so than that, it's a strategy."
625,00:36:15.79,00:36:15.79,"The quicker that we can get Terry's immunity necklace,"
626,00:36:18.96,00:36:18.96,which-- I call it Terry's 'cause he's the only one who's worn it
627,00:36:21.17,00:36:21.17,"so far-- off of his neck, the quicker that we can get into our"
628,00:36:24.58,00:36:24.58,"strategy. We didn't, it's over, and so now"
629,00:36:27.83,00:36:27.83,"the lay of the land is a lot less safe for myself, but it is"
630,00:36:31.79,00:36:31.79,"what it is. >> PROBST: Shane, is it talked"
631,00:36:33.83,00:36:33.83,"about, Terry's dominance? >> Yeah, it's absolutely"
632,00:36:37.25,00:36:37.25,"apparent, but it's going to take him six immunities in a row to"
633,00:36:40.38,00:36:40.38,win. I don't think it can be done.
634,00:36:43.08,00:36:43.08,"If there's anyone that can do it, it's Terry."
635,00:36:45.21,00:36:45.21,The guy is a 47-year-old beast and we as a group can't really
636,00:36:50.08,00:36:50.08,afford to be eating cheeseburgers after today.
637,00:36:52.79,00:36:52.79,">> But, regardless, I'm going to continue winning immunities"
638,00:36:55.17,00:36:55.17,whether they like it or not... >> Here we go.
639,00:36:57.12,00:36:57.12,>> ...and my target isn't going to get any bigger.
640,00:36:59.04,00:36:59.04,"If I had five of these in my back pocket, I'd be out there"
641,00:37:01.67,00:37:01.67,"competing, especially against Aras 'cause he's a bad dude and"
642,00:37:03.92,00:37:03.92,I want to go out there and beat him.
643,00:37:06.29,00:37:06.29,">> PROBST: Danielle, Terry said ""I'm gonna keep winning them."""
644,00:37:08.79,00:37:08.79,"You mumbled ""Here we go again."" >> 'Cause he always talks about"
645,00:37:11.62,00:37:11.62,how he's so competitive and he's so great at everything and it's
646,00:37:15.29,00:37:15.29,"all about Terry, Terry, Terry, but power to him for being as"
647,00:37:18.42,00:37:18.42,"confident and cocky as he is, but..."
648,00:37:20.62,00:37:20.62,>> PROBST: I just think it's an interesting comment coming from
649,00:37:23.25,00:37:23.25,"you, seeing how confident you were today and how cocky the six"
650,00:37:26.46,00:37:26.46,of you have been for the last several Tribals.
651,00:37:28.58,00:37:28.58,">> Yeah, but I don't think we're coming off as strongly as Terry"
652,00:37:32.25,00:37:32.25,does. He's a super competitive guy.
653,00:37:34.83,00:37:34.83,I'm not knocking that and I'm very competitive as well and...
654,00:37:38.08,00:37:38.08,>> PROBST: Is that part of the problem-- that you can't beat
655,00:37:41.00,00:37:41.00,"him and it frustrates you? >> I mean, it is frustrating,"
656,00:37:43.29,00:37:43.29,but there's going to be a challenge where Terry can't win.
657,00:37:46.96,00:37:46.96,"I mean, if he keeps winning every single one, God bless him."
658,00:37:50.88,00:37:50.88,">> PROBST: Cirie, five of the eight of you have now been to"
659,00:37:54.25,00:37:54.25,"Exile Island, have now had a chance to look for the hidden"
660,00:37:57.17,00:37:57.17,immunity idol. Are people speculating if it's
661,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,"been found? >> There's, like, 15 million"
662,00:38:02.21,00:38:02.21,"different stories. It's here, there it is, they"
663,00:38:05.38,00:38:05.38,"don't have it, they have it. I think everyone here just wants"
664,00:38:08.79,00:38:08.79,"it out. If you have it tonight, here's"
665,00:38:12.29,00:38:12.29,your chance. >> I don't want it played
666,00:38:14.33,00:38:14.33,"tonight because if it's played tonight, it's me most likely"
667,00:38:17.58,00:38:17.58,"walking down that corridor, so let it play on a night where I"
668,00:38:21.21,00:38:21.21,have the immunity necklace. That's my thought.
669,00:38:25.12,00:38:25.12,">> PROBST: Okay, Terry once again has the immunity necklace."
670,00:38:28.38,00:38:28.38,"As always, it's yours to assign to somebody else if you want."
671,00:38:31.12,00:38:31.12,">> I'm keeping it. >> PROBST: Okay, if the hidden"
672,00:38:33.25,00:38:33.25,"immunity idol comes into play, we will know after the vote."
673,00:38:36.58,00:38:36.58,"It is time to vote. Sally, you're up."
674,00:38:48.17,00:38:48.17,">> (clicking tongue): I'm kind of sick of the six of you, so"
675,00:38:52.04,00:38:52.04,"one at a time. >> Just strategy, nothing"
676,00:39:07.42,00:39:07.42,personal. Hope you have the idol.
677,00:39:18.54,00:39:18.54,">> You're still the number one threat, buddy."
678,00:39:31.42,00:39:31.42,>> You're a great player in this game and too much of a threat.
679,00:39:37.17,00:39:37.17,So sorry. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
680,00:39:46.71,00:39:46.71,"votes. Once the votes are read, the"
681,00:39:58.17,00:39:58.17,decision is final. The person voted out will be
682,00:40:00.25,00:40:00.25,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
683,00:40:02.50,00:40:02.50,I'll read the votes. First vote-- Sally.
684,00:40:11.71,00:40:11.71,Sally. Two votes Sally.
685,00:40:17.71,00:40:17.71,Aras. Aras.
686,00:40:23.00,00:40:23.00,"Two votes Sally, two votes Aras. Sally."
687,00:40:30.46,00:40:30.46,"That's three votes Sally, two votes Aras."
688,00:40:34.62,00:40:34.62,"Sally. Four votes Sally, two votes"
689,00:40:38.17,00:40:38.17,Aras. Ninth person voted out of
690,00:40:44.96,00:40:44.96,Survivor: Exile Island: Sally. That's enough votes.
691,00:40:48.17,00:40:48.17,"Unless you have the immunity idol, you need to bring me your"
692,00:40:50.75,00:40:50.75,"torch. Sally, the tribe has spoken."
693,00:41:12.92,00:41:12.92,"It's time for you to go. Well, at this point, the game"
694,00:41:24.21,00:41:24.21,seems pretty clear: six former Casaya against Terry.
695,00:41:27.21,00:41:27.21,"Terry says he's going to keep winning immunity, Casaya says he"
696,00:41:29.54,00:41:29.54,"won't. Either way, going to be fun to"
697,00:41:32.08,00:41:32.08,"watch. Grab your torches, head back to"
698,00:41:34.12,00:41:34.12,camp. Good night.
