96,00:07:28.63,00:07:28.63,Just go sit down and stop ...with your blade.
97,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,You don't need to do that.Not chopping anything's ... head

103,00:07:47.73,00:07:47.73,"He's just being an ass,sharpening machete."
104,00:07:49.43,00:07:49.43,That's the dumbest thing I'veever seen.
105,00:07:50.87,00:07:50.87,"In fact, I was embarrassed bythat."

107,00:07:58.17,00:07:58.17,irritate me right now.I believe Osten was afraid of

109,00:08:03.30,00:08:03.30,"I mean, if you're afraid ofthe jungle and you're afraid"

117,00:08:38.77,00:08:38.77,that that would stop thebiting at night.
118,00:08:40.43,00:08:40.43,>> We want to keep away from thesand as high as we can.
119,00:08:43.13,00:08:43.13,>> Even though most of us didnot understand or agree that

121,00:08:49.93,00:08:49.93,biting.>> I really think that just
122,00:08:51.90,00:08:51.90,to raise it an inch or two withbamboo is almost a waste of
123,00:08:54.63,00:08:54.63,energy and time.We might as well wait till
124,00:08:56.27,00:08:56.27,"tomorrow.>> All the ... off, we're doing"
125,00:08:58.43,00:08:58.43,it today.>> Damn straight.

130,00:09:12.20,00:09:12.20,>> I just don't think it's goingto make much of a difference to
131,00:09:14.60,00:09:14.60,raise it this much.'Cause that bamboo is like...
132,00:09:16.50,00:09:16.50,"two inches high, not even.>> Shawn kept looking for"
133,00:09:20.73,00:09:20.73,"excuses why not to helpand Jon's, like, had it up to"
134,00:09:24.47,00:09:24.47,"here with him.>> Rupe, you don't think we"
135,00:09:26.57,00:09:26.57,"could just slide, like, lift upsections and slide the logs"

151,00:10:05.03,00:10:05.03,"You're ... ridiculous, dude.Don't even go there."
152,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,>> I just asked you to just pullthose out.
153,00:10:09.67,00:10:09.67,">> Just shut up!Just shut up, okay? Shut up."
154,00:10:11.87,00:10:11.87,How about that one?Try that one.
155,00:10:13.87,00:10:13.87,>> I'll ... shut up the day youstart ... working.

165,00:10:40.70,00:10:40.70,Shawn practically putthe whole shelter together.
166,00:10:43.73,00:10:43.73,Maybe Shawn should get a cluethat he's not anybody's buddy
167,00:10:45.90,00:10:45.90,here.That he needs to get

306,00:19:30.53,00:19:30.53,>> You're going to have to getup in a few minutes and go loot.
307,00:19:33.57,00:19:33.57,Okay?>> Okay. I'll get up.
308,00:19:34.97,00:19:34.97,>> You want to wake up.>> I'm about to go lootin'

320,00:20:33.37,00:20:33.37,What's up?>> Little Jon from Drake
321,00:20:35.23,00:20:35.23,came to our camp to raid it.He was a lot more humble than
322,00:20:39.67,00:20:39.67,he usually is.He looked like he put his
323,00:20:41.57,00:20:41.57,"diplomat hat on, remembered someof his people skills and he..."
324,00:20:43.83,00:20:43.83,he wasn't as cocky or asarrogant.
325,00:20:46.03,00:20:46.03,"So what are your thoughtstoday, Big Jon?"
326,00:20:47.77,00:20:47.77,"Everyone voted we have to takeyour pot, uh, as a strategic"
327,00:20:50.40,00:20:50.40,"move, in case you come after ourpot."
328,00:20:53.20,00:20:53.20,>> I thought you were comingafter the shower.
329,00:20:55.40,00:20:55.40,>> Nah. I... you know what?I would love to wash my
330,00:20:58.63,00:20:58.63,hair before I go.>> Then Little Jon indicated
331,00:21:00.37,00:21:00.37,nothing would make him happierthan to have some shampoo to
332,00:21:03.33,00:21:03.33,"wash his hair.Gave him some shampoo,"
333,00:21:04.97,00:21:04.97,a diplomatic gesture on ourpart.
334,00:21:06.80,00:21:06.80,>> Awesome.Have you guys noticed
335,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,I've been a little nicer atchallenges?
336,00:21:11.57,00:21:11.57,">> We don't mind talking smack,but it hurts when you lose six"
337,00:21:14.77,00:21:14.77,straight challenges.>> Oh.
338,00:21:16.27,00:21:16.27,">> If we were winning thosechallenges, talking smack"
339,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,doesn't bother me.It just...
340,00:21:21.53,00:21:21.53,">> Well, technically, seven.We threw the seventh one"
341,00:21:27.00,00:21:27.00,"just to get Burton out.Like, I mean, did you notice"
342,00:21:31.60,00:21:31.60,"that I... I moved my guys outof the way? But, anyway..."
343,00:21:35.13,00:21:35.13,"I'll be right back.>> Throwing the challenge, him."
344,00:21:39.73,00:21:39.73,>> Seven is what he said.>> Him.
345,00:21:42.93,00:21:42.93,>> Who said that?>> He said he... they threw the
346,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,"challenge for that piece...chess piece, as if they"
347,00:21:48.30,00:21:48.30,"weren't trying.>> Yeah, right."
348,00:21:49.67,00:21:49.67,">> The whole time.>> He screwed up, majorly."
349,00:21:51.30,00:21:51.30,>> He claims he threw theChess-Checker Water Challenge.
350,00:21:53.50,00:21:53.50,I think that's just nonsense andI think it's bad sportsmanship
351,00:21:56.47,00:21:56.47,"for him, little bastard, toindicate that we didn't fair and"
352,00:21:58.90,00:21:58.90,"square win that challenge.So, I don't think they did throw"
353,00:22:03.00,00:22:03.00,it. But just for that little pissant
354,00:22:04.33,00:22:04.33,"to take that away from us, it'sridiculous."
355,00:22:08.77,00:22:08.77,">> Bye, guys.>> Bye."
356,00:22:10.70,00:22:10.70,">> You know, he came hereto ruffle some feathers and he"
357,00:22:14.03,00:22:14.03,"definitely did.Hey, say ""hey"" to Rupert for us."
358,00:22:16.00,00:22:16.00,>> I will.>> And it concerned me from an
359,00:22:18.57,00:22:18.57,"immunity standpoint, becausethe most critical one coming up"
360,00:22:21.23,00:22:21.23,"today, that he's causingdissension among the ranks."
361,00:22:24.63,00:22:24.63,And let the games begin.Let's take the gloves off and
362,00:22:27.57,00:22:27.57,let's see what they're made of.Let's have some fun.
363,00:22:42.03,00:22:42.03,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys!What's going on, Rupert?"
364,00:22:44.90,00:22:44.90,">> ( laughs ): Play time.>> PROBST: What's up, T?"
365,00:22:47.43,00:22:47.43,">> Hey.>> PROBST: Christa, getting more"
366,00:22:51.47,00:22:51.47,bug bites.>> I don't know what happened to
367,00:22:54.03,00:22:54.03,me last night.I guess I just have some new
368,00:22:56.93,00:22:56.93,freckles that have developed.It's cool.
369,00:22:59.10,00:22:59.10,">> PROBST: All right, firstthings first."
370,00:23:01.70,00:23:01.70,"Immunity... back up for grabs.Okay, today's immunity challenge"
371,00:23:08.50,00:23:08.50,will require strategy andendurance.
372,00:23:13.33,00:23:13.33,Three tribe members from eachtribe will have a wooden pole
373,00:23:17.70,00:23:17.70,"across their shoulders.Each round, weight will be added"
374,00:23:20.10,00:23:20.10,to those poles until you cannottake it any longer.
375,00:23:24.23,00:23:24.23,That's the endurance portion.But the decision of which
376,00:23:28.13,00:23:28.13,tribe member gets the weightadded to their shoulders will
377,00:23:30.80,00:23:30.80,be made by only two members fromthe opposing tribe.
378,00:23:33.50,00:23:33.50,That's the strategy.Once you can't hold the weight
379,00:23:35.93,00:23:35.93,"any longer, drop the pole,you're out of the game."

567,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,"Uh, good guy, but I'm notsigning my million dollar check"
568,00:33:42.80,00:33:42.80,"to him, so that's the way thegame's played."
569,00:33:47.23,00:33:47.23,">> Remember I said, ""You lookout for my back, I'll look out"

571,00:33:54.47,00:33:54.47,Little do they know what'sreally going to happen.
572,00:33:57.13,00:33:57.13,I think everyone is going to bevery shocked.
573,00:33:59.53,00:33:59.53,Everyone.(chuckles)
574,00:34:19.30,00:34:19.30,">> PROBST: Well, judging by howconfident you guys act at"
575,00:34:21.80,00:34:21.80,challenges and seeing thattoday's immunity challenge was
576,00:34:27.40,00:34:27.40,"physical, I know you were notexpecting to be here again"
577,00:34:30.70,00:34:30.70,tonight.Sandra?
578,00:34:32.57,00:34:32.57,>> Definitely not.We were on full tummies.
579,00:34:36.63,00:34:36.63,"Our motivation was up there.We were like, ""There's no way."
580,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,"""They're dying ""of hunger.""They don't have it together."
581,00:34:43.47,00:34:43.47,"There's no way we can getbeat. No way."""
582,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,>> PROBST: Let's talk abouttoday's challenge.
583,00:34:47.50,00:34:47.50,"Christa, you outlasted a lot ofpeople, including Morgan's"
584,00:34:49.90,00:34:49.90,"strongest guy, Osten.You had as much weight as he did"
585,00:34:52.87,00:34:52.87,when he dropped out.>> The challenge was hard.
586,00:34:56.10,00:34:56.10,I... didn't think that Iactually could pull that much
587,00:35:03.33,00:35:03.33,"weight, but, uh, I did.And it sucked to drop it,"
588,00:35:07.70,00:35:07.70,though.>> PROBST: Rupert... I'd be
589,00:35:09.40,00:35:09.40,lying if I didn't say you lookedincredibly sad.
590,00:35:13.27,00:35:13.27,Your eyes are sunken.Your smile is gone.
591,00:35:17.07,00:35:17.07,>> 'Cause I'm ready to cry.>> PROBST: What's that?
592,00:35:18.53,00:35:18.53,>> I'm ready to cry.>> PROBST: Why?
593,00:35:22.70,00:35:22.70,>> We shouldn't be here.>> PROBST: So are you upset
594,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,about losing?Are you upset about where the
595,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,tribe is?>> I'm upset the way the tribe
596,00:35:32.13,00:35:32.13,"has gone.We started out so strong, and"
597,00:35:35.90,00:35:35.90,now we are not.And it's hard to pull everybody
598,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,together.>> PROBST: Are you losing hope
599,00:35:44.03,00:35:44.03,that that can happen?You can't lose hope.
600,00:35:50.97,00:35:50.97,You got to believe that youcan.
601,00:35:55.97,00:35:55.97,We'll lose one person tonight.I hope it's not me.
602,00:36:00.30,00:36:00.30,"And maybe then, we'll try andbuild a stronger Drake tribe."
603,00:36:03.10,00:36:03.10,>> PROBST: Why would it be youtonight?
604,00:36:05.10,00:36:05.10,>> I think my tribe sees me nowas unneeded.
605,00:36:08.50,00:36:08.50,They have gotten it in theirheads-- even though I'm trying
606,00:36:16.07,00:36:16.07,desperately to make thembelieve there is no
607,00:36:19.80,00:36:19.80,"certainties of a merge, thereis no certainties of anything"
608,00:36:22.23,00:36:22.23,"in this game-- that if I make itto the end, they can't beat me."
609,00:36:26.73,00:36:26.73,"Uh, if I make it to the merge,I'll win a lot of the"
610,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33,immunities; they can't beat me.Doesn't give a damn if I catch
611,00:36:33.30,00:36:33.30,them ten pounds of fish a day.I know at least half my tribe
612,00:36:35.47,00:36:35.47,"wants me gone.>> PROBST: Trish, when you hear"
613,00:36:38.10,00:36:38.10,"a guy like this, who's been astrong member of your tribe,"
614,00:36:40.97,00:36:40.97,"feel like half the tribe hasturned on him, what are your"
615,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,thoughts?>> I'm surprised to hear him say
616,00:36:46.20,00:36:46.20,"that, to tell you the truth.I didn't know he felt that way"
617,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,"at all.So, to hear him talk like that,"
618,00:36:58.87,00:36:58.87,"you know, it's-it's, um... sadto me."
619,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,I had no idea that that's theway he felt.
620,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,>> PROBST: Is it hard for you tovote somebody out tonight?
621,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.It's really hard for me to vote
622,00:37:06.90,00:37:06.90,"somebody out tonight.>> PROBST: Sandra, how sure are"
623,00:37:08.83,00:37:08.83,"you that it's not you tonight?>> Oh, I know it ain't me."
624,00:37:16.40,00:37:16.40,(laughing)The person that's going home
625,00:37:18.20,00:37:18.20,today is the one that leastexpects it.
626,00:37:20.37,00:37:20.37,It's the person that in the pastcouple of days has been giving
627,00:37:23.30,00:37:23.30,so many different stories thatwe don't know what the heck to
628,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,"believe.This person will be missed, but,"
629,00:37:28.03,00:37:28.03,"for the good of the tribe, thisperson has got to go home."
630,00:37:30.70,00:37:30.70,"(laughter)>> PROBST: With that, it is"
631,00:37:37.63,00:37:37.63,"time to vote.Christa, you're up."
632,00:37:52.87,00:37:52.87,>> (whispering): You stabbed usall in the back.
633,00:37:56.23,00:37:56.23,"You have no idea how to playthis game, but good try."
634,00:37:59.47,00:37:59.47,"See you later.>> Everybody's got a price,"
635,00:38:12.63,00:38:12.63,"everybody's got to pay, 'cause amillion dollar man always gets"
636,00:38:15.57,00:38:15.57,his way.>> I've always said you were a
637,00:38:29.00,00:38:29.00,"snake from day one.Um, you can't be trusted, so,"
638,00:38:31.50,00:38:31.50,"um, good-bye, adios.>> Rupert, I'm voting you out"
639,00:38:44.07,00:38:44.07,because I think you just havetoo much power with the other
640,00:38:47.33,00:38:47.33,"tribe, and it just seems to methat you are straddling both"
641,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,tribes.>> I cannot believe that you
642,00:39:01.57,00:39:01.57,turned on me so quickly.Everybody in my tribe tells me
643,00:39:05.50,00:39:05.50,"that you want me out, and youlie right to my face."
644,00:39:08.63,00:39:08.63,I can't take that.>> You know what?
645,00:39:20.40,00:39:20.40,"Game's over for you.It's my game now, so good-bye."
646,00:39:33.70,00:39:33.70,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
647,00:39:47.60,00:39:47.60,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
648,00:39:49.37,00:39:49.37,The person voted out will beasked to leave the Tribal
649,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,Council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
650,00:39:57.83,00:39:57.83,First vote--Trish.

658,00:41:00.77,00:41:00.77,"Well, the one thing that cameout of tonight's Tribal Council"
659,00:41:03.10,00:41:03.10,is that there are veryfew things that are certain in
660,00:41:06.17,00:41:06.17,this game.One thing that is certain-- this
661,00:41:08.93,00:41:08.93,tribe has been to Tribal Councilthree times in a row.
662,00:41:11.87,00:41:11.87,"You are now down to fivemembers, same as the Morgan"
663,00:41:14.50,00:41:14.50,tribe.21 days left.
664,00:41:17.13,00:41:17.13,It is anybody's game.Grab your torches.

671,00:41:55.73,00:41:55.73,"checked out.I could see in his eyes, he's"
672,00:41:57.60,00:41:57.60,throwing in the towel again.>> PROBST: And Morgan and Drake
673,00:41:59.87,00:41:59.87,are in for a big twist.Your past has come back to
674,00:42:02.63,00:42:02.63,haunt you.>> I didn't see this coming at 
675,00:42:12.03,00:42:12.03,"all, obviously.But I always knew that anything"
676,00:42:14.93,00:42:14.93,"can happen.And so, I really never took"
677,00:42:17.50,00:42:17.50,anything for granted.Hats off to the Drake Tribe.
678,00:42:20.07,00:42:20.07,I think you guys are all great.I hope one of the Drakes end up
679,00:42:22.97,00:42:22.97,"winning the million dollars.Good for you guys, you kept a"
