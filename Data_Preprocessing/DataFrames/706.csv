6,00:00:11.10,00:00:11.10,>> Probably the smartest thing this tribe ever did was get

8,00:00:15.93,00:00:15.93,"away from camp, his loyalty was questioned."
9,00:00:18.67,00:00:18.67,>> I'm afraid he's giving away too much information about us
10,00:00:21.53,00:00:21.53,and not realizing it. >> PROBST: At the reward
11,00:00:23.37,00:00:23.37,"challenge, with Rupert still on board, Morgan claimed victory."
12,00:00:26.93,00:00:26.93,"Morgan wins reward! Rupert then returned to Drake,"
13,00:00:30.30,00:00:30.30,where he was greeted with open arms.
14,00:00:32.57,00:00:32.57,We welcome back this guy. Morgan returned to camp in high
15,00:00:34.47,00:00:34.47,"spirits-- with rain ponchos, a cooking pot, and a chance to get"
16,00:00:37.80,00:00:37.80,"clean. At the immunity challenge,"
17,00:00:40.50,00:00:40.50,Rupert arrived with a new friend...
18,00:00:42.67,00:00:42.67,>> This is Balboa. >> PROBST: ...and Darrah kept

21,00:00:50.60,00:00:50.60,Michelle made a last-minute plea to stay on the island.
22,00:00:53.57,00:00:53.57,I can't trust Shawn further than I could throw him.
23,00:00:56.77,00:00:56.77,">> PROBST: But it wasn't enough, and at Drake's second Tribal"
24,00:00:59.57,00:00:59.57,"Council, they voted Michelle out of the Pearl Islands."
25,00:01:03.20,00:01:03.20,"Michelle, the tribe has spoken. 11 are left."
26,00:01:08.80,00:01:08.80,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
27,00:02:16.87,00:02:16.87,(thunder rumbles) >> I thought Michelle left
28,00:02:23.87,00:02:23.87,with a lot of class. >> She did.
29,00:02:26.87,00:02:26.87,She's a very good girl. And it's too bad she's not on
30,00:02:29.87,00:02:29.87,our tribe anymore. My first Tribal Council sucked.
31,00:02:37.13,00:02:37.13,I was mad and I was tired. I was pissed off.
32,00:02:41.43,00:02:41.43,"I didn't want to be there. >> I tell you, Jeff was pretty"
33,00:02:45.27,00:02:45.27,"direct with his questions tonight, wasn't he?"
34,00:02:47.97,00:02:47.97,>> He was trying to get to the bottom of stuff.
35,00:02:52.17,00:02:52.17,">> He didn't want to hear no sugarcoating, nothing."
36,00:02:54.37,00:02:54.37,>> We were brutally honest this time.
37,00:02:56.43,00:02:56.43,"And I am sorry that I, I... if I offended anybody in any of"
38,00:03:01.90,00:03:01.90,my answers. I hope I didn't.
39,00:03:04.53,00:03:04.53,>> No. No. Not at all. >> Good.
40,00:03:07.97,00:03:07.97,They still do not see that we gave Morgan some great momentum.
41,00:03:14.13,00:03:14.13,They don't see that. I can't believe I wrote
42,00:03:19.63,00:03:19.63,Michelle's name down instead of Shawn.
43,00:03:22.00,00:03:22.00,Should have been Shawn. (sighs)
44,00:03:30.37,00:03:30.37,"For awhile, everybody knew a Drake was going to win this."
45,00:03:36.13,00:03:36.13,"Now, there is question. You all right, Balboa?"
46,00:03:57.93,00:03:57.93,"Oh, you feel awful cold. You're not..."
47,00:04:07.63,00:04:07.63,"You didn't make it through the night, buddy."
48,00:04:09.83,00:04:09.83,"(sighs) This morning, I went and"
49,00:04:15.87,00:04:15.87,checked on Balboa. He was dead.
50,00:04:25.87,00:04:25.87,"So sorry, buddy. It's a hard world."
51,00:04:36.53,00:04:36.53,>> How's Balboa doing? >> He's dead.
52,00:04:39.83,00:04:39.83,>> Is he really? >> They want to use him for
53,00:04:43.63,00:04:43.63,"bait, so I'm burying him. >> He died last night?"
54,00:04:45.77,00:04:45.77,">> Yeah, he's gone. >> That's so sad."
55,00:04:48.03,00:04:48.03,">> Rupert was a little upset. You know, he gets really"
56,00:04:51.70,00:04:51.70,attached to funny little things and the snake was one of them.
57,00:04:53.90,00:04:53.90,I don't know why he's so worried about a little snake he found
58,00:04:56.17,00:04:56.17,"in the water, but, you know, who knows? That's Rupert."
59,00:05:01.10,00:05:01.10,(squawking) (squawking)
60,00:05:28.80,00:05:28.80,"(squawking) >> Hey, hey, hey."
61,00:05:36.40,00:05:36.40,"You don't need to be doing that. Oh, you want to challenge me?"
62,00:05:39.67,00:05:39.67,(chuckles) Come on.
63,00:05:41.97,00:05:41.97,(squawks) He's trying to get our flag.
64,00:05:46.10,00:05:46.10,"Move it. Hey, buddy."
65,00:05:47.93,00:05:47.93,You're out of here. >> There's a pelican
66,00:05:52.23,00:05:52.23,"that just came by camp, and Ryno has a soft spot for"
67,00:05:56.00,00:05:56.00,"animals, which is great. So, Ryno starts petting it,"
68,00:05:58.33,00:05:58.33,"making it feel good, and he's just trying to help it out."
69,00:06:01.33,00:06:01.33,"So, it was pretty funny. Did you give her a name yet?"
70,00:06:03.90,00:06:03.90,>> His name's Pelican Pete. He's our mascot for a little
71,00:06:06.13,00:06:06.13,while. (squawks)
72,00:06:14.60,00:06:14.60,>> Your friend is waiting outside for you.
73,00:06:16.77,00:06:16.77,">> Oh, yeah, here he comes. >> He's really coming and"
74,00:06:18.87,00:06:18.87,following you. (laughing)
75,00:06:20.17,00:06:20.17,Osten's going to be highly upset.
76,00:06:23.17,00:06:23.17,You want to come in? Come on.
77,00:06:27.23,00:06:27.23,"(laughing) Osten, don't do that!"
78,00:06:30.63,00:06:30.63,Be nice. Just see what he does.
79,00:06:33.47,00:06:33.47,He's not going to get up here. >> Why would you want this
80,00:06:37.77,00:06:37.77,thing in here? I'm being dead serious.
81,00:06:39.27,00:06:39.27,"I'm, like, I would get the machete and chop this"
82,00:06:42.40,00:06:42.40,thing's head right the ... off. I'm not playing around.
83,00:06:44.67,00:06:44.67,(squawking) I'm going to get the machete
84,00:06:49.10,00:06:49.10,right now. I'm not playing around.
85,00:06:50.60,00:06:50.60,>> He wants to sit on your lap. >> I am not kidding.
86,00:06:53.30,00:06:53.30,(laughing) Here he comes.
87,00:06:56.30,00:06:56.30,(laughing) >> I think it's hilarious that
88,00:07:03.10,00:07:03.10,Osten is scared of every little thing.
89,00:07:06.50,00:07:06.50,"I mean, he's such a big guy, you would think that, you know, he"
90,00:07:09.77,00:07:09.77,"wouldn't be scared of anything, but, you know, he's scared of"
91,00:07:12.13,00:07:12.13,"every little bug. >> Come on, buddy."
92,00:07:13.63,00:07:13.63,Let's go. Let's go.
93,00:07:14.73,00:07:14.73,You're not welcome. Come on.
94,00:07:19.00,00:07:19.00,>> I don't like animals. I been bit by a couple
95,00:07:21.43,00:07:21.43,"animals, and the next animal that bites me will die."
96,00:07:24.13,00:07:24.13,I have no problem chopping that thing's head straight off.
97,00:07:28.63,00:07:28.63,Just go sit down and stop ... with your blade.
98,00:07:30.77,00:07:30.77,You don't need to do that. Not chopping anything's ... head
99,00:07:33.33,00:07:33.33,off unless we're going to eat it.
100,00:07:37.20,00:07:37.20,"We're not eating this one. Come on, buddy."
101,00:07:39.90,00:07:39.90,Come on. >> Ryno's just trying to
102,00:07:43.40,00:07:43.40,help out a poor old pelican and O.T.'s just being an ass.
103,00:07:46.37,00:07:46.37,There's no other way to look at it.
104,00:07:47.73,00:07:47.73,"He's just being an ass, sharpening machete."
105,00:07:49.43,00:07:49.43,That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
106,00:07:50.87,00:07:50.87,"In fact, I was embarrassed by that."
107,00:07:56.07,00:07:56.07,">> Sit down, though. I don't... I don't need you to"
108,00:07:58.17,00:07:58.17,irritate me right now. I believe Osten was afraid of
109,00:08:01.30,00:08:01.30,"it. He was, he was pissing me off."
110,00:08:03.30,00:08:03.30,"I mean, if you're afraid of the jungle and you're afraid"
111,00:08:04.97,00:08:04.97,of the sea and you're afraid of birds... You know what?
112,00:08:06.50,00:08:06.50,Don't even come out here. (squawks)
113,00:08:08.67,00:08:08.67,"All right, Pete. I'll see you later, buddy."
114,00:08:27.27,00:08:27.27,">> If we have a free day today, I'm gonna gather logs and"
115,00:08:30.37,00:08:30.37,"we're tearing our floor apart and getting it six inches,"
116,00:08:33.20,00:08:33.20,eight inches off the ground. >> Rupert felt that if we could
117,00:08:36.40,00:08:36.40,"elevate the bamboo off the ground, even a few inches,"
118,00:08:38.77,00:08:38.77,that that would stop the biting at night.
119,00:08:40.43,00:08:40.43,>> We want to keep away from the sand as high as we can.
120,00:08:43.13,00:08:43.13,>> Even though most of us did not understand or agree that
121,00:08:46.50,00:08:46.50,"this was going to help anything, we would do anything to stop the"
122,00:08:49.93,00:08:49.93,biting. >> I really think that just
123,00:08:51.90,00:08:51.90,to raise it an inch or two with bamboo is almost a waste of
124,00:08:54.63,00:08:54.63,energy and time. We might as well wait till
125,00:08:56.27,00:08:56.27,"tomorrow. >> All the ... off, we're doing"
126,00:08:58.43,00:08:58.43,it today. >> Damn straight.
127,00:09:00.93,00:09:00.93,">> So, everybody starts taking the shelter apart and what"
128,00:09:03.20,00:09:03.20,"happened? Shawn told Jon, ""Well, I think"
129,00:09:05.70,00:09:05.70,"this is all a waste of time. ""I don't think we should be"
130,00:09:09.23,00:09:09.23,"wasting our energy doing all of this."""
131,00:09:12.20,00:09:12.20,>> I just don't think it's going to make much of a difference to
132,00:09:14.60,00:09:14.60,raise it this much. 'Cause that bamboo is like...
133,00:09:16.50,00:09:16.50,"two inches high, not even. >> Shawn kept looking for"
134,00:09:20.73,00:09:20.73,"excuses why not to help and Jon's, like, had it up to"
135,00:09:24.47,00:09:24.47,"here with him. >> Rupe, you don't think we"
136,00:09:26.57,00:09:26.57,"could just slide, like, lift up sections and slide the logs"
137,00:09:28.77,00:09:28.77,under? >> Jon. Stop.
138,00:09:30.87,00:09:30.87,"Where you going, Jon? >> I know, but I'm getting tired"
139,00:09:34.80,00:09:34.80,just watching everyone just watching.
140,00:09:36.50,00:09:36.50,">> Yeah, but, you know, you're making, uh, ten times more work."
141,00:09:39.00,00:09:39.00,>> No we're not! We're doing...
142,00:09:40.33,00:09:40.33,It's ten times more work to talk about it for a .... hour.
143,00:09:44.53,00:09:44.53,I'll have all these out by the time everyone's ... done just
144,00:09:47.03,00:09:47.03,"looking at it. >> Jon, honestly, relax, bro."
145,00:09:49.33,00:09:49.33,">> Damn it, dude! You do more not to do work"
146,00:09:54.00,00:09:54.00,"than doing work! >> What are you talking about,"
147,00:09:55.87,00:09:55.87,Jon? Relax. We're working here.
148,00:09:57.30,00:09:57.30,">> No, you're just, you're not-- >> Are we on a time basis?"
149,00:10:00.27,00:10:00.27,">> I could give a ...! Dude, don't tell me to..."
150,00:10:01.83,00:10:01.83,"Just do it and I will relax! >> Jon, chill your ... head, all"
151,00:10:03.83,00:10:03.83,"right? >> Oh, my God."
152,00:10:05.03,00:10:05.03,"You're ... ridiculous, dude. Don't even go there."
153,00:10:07.33,00:10:07.33,>> I just asked you to just pull those out.
154,00:10:09.67,00:10:09.67,">> Just shut up! Just shut up, okay? Shut up."
155,00:10:11.87,00:10:11.87,How about that one? Try that one.
156,00:10:13.87,00:10:13.87,>> I'll ... shut up the day you start ... working.
157,00:10:15.83,00:10:15.83,">> You know what, Jon, just shut up, all right?!"
158,00:10:18.97,00:10:18.97,>> God! You still can't do it! >> Just shut up.
159,00:10:21.10,00:10:21.10,>> I'll ... walk away just for you to ... do it!
160,00:10:24.07,00:10:24.07,>> Walk away. >> I will!
161,00:10:25.23,00:10:25.23,>> Good. Ridiculous.
162,00:10:27.53,00:10:27.53,">> No, what's ... ridiculous is not doing anything!"
163,00:10:30.60,00:10:30.60,"That's ... ridiculous! >> You see us here, Jon?"
164,00:10:32.70,00:10:32.70,Relax! Okay? >> I'm glad Jon put him in his
165,00:10:38.10,00:10:38.10,"place. And after that, what happened?"
166,00:10:40.70,00:10:40.70,Shawn practically put the whole shelter together.
167,00:10:43.73,00:10:43.73,Maybe Shawn should get a clue that he's not anybody's buddy
168,00:10:45.90,00:10:45.90,here. That he needs to get
169,00:10:48.13,00:10:48.13,whatever has to happen done. He needs to make sure we win
170,00:10:51.30,00:10:51.30,the challenge... or he's going home.
171,00:10:53.30,00:10:53.30,And that's it. >> Sea mail.
172,00:11:14.17,00:11:14.17,>> That's a cool pouch. >> A cannonball.
173,00:11:18.57,00:11:18.57,">> What's it say? >> ""Batten down the hatches,"
174,00:11:22.23,00:11:22.23,"it's time to have a blast. Ready, aim, fire!"
175,00:11:25.07,00:11:25.07,Who'll be standing last? Will your tribe fall short or
176,00:11:27.73,00:11:27.73,will you go too far? Your stomach will thank you.
177,00:11:33.90,00:11:33.90,"It's the tastiest reward by far."""
178,00:11:36.77,00:11:36.77,">> Food, baby! (cheering)"
179,00:11:38.97,00:11:38.97,">> You know, I think we're feeling vulnerable going into"
180,00:11:42.60,00:11:42.60,this next challenge. We really want to get our
181,00:11:45.00,00:11:45.00,momentum back. And we've lost three
182,00:11:47.03,00:11:47.03,"challenges in a row. Today's a new day, we're a"
183,00:11:49.30,00:11:49.30,strong tribe. We're totally united.
184,00:11:51.90,00:11:51.90,All we have to do is get our strategy back for the next two
185,00:11:55.20,00:11:55.20,"challenges, and just kick ass and just make it happen."
186,00:11:57.47,00:11:57.47,>> I know. We're going to go kick some
187,00:11:58.87,00:11:58.87,"Morgan ass. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
188,00:12:12.83,00:12:12.83,"Take a spot on your mat. Morgan, getting your first"
189,00:12:19.23,00:12:19.23,look at the new Drake tribe. Michelle voted out at the last
190,00:12:22.63,00:12:22.63,Tribal Council. Drake now down to six members.
191,00:12:25.10,00:12:25.10,Numbers are evening up. You guys ready for today's
192,00:12:27.50,00:12:27.50,reward challenge? Let's get to it.
193,00:12:29.80,00:12:29.80,"For today's challenge, in classic pirate style you will"
194,00:12:32.20,00:12:32.20,fire a cannon. One tribe member at a time
195,00:12:36.47,00:12:36.47,"will come up, you will load the cannon, you will aim the"
196,00:12:39.33,00:12:39.33,"cannon, and, using fire, you will light the cannon."
197,00:12:42.53,00:12:42.53,Your goal: knock out one of the other tribe's targets.
198,00:12:44.87,00:12:44.87,First tribe to knock out all four targets wins reward.
199,00:12:47.60,00:12:47.60,Want to know what you're playing for?
200,00:12:50.13,00:12:50.13,">> Yeah. >> Oh, hell yeah."
201,00:12:51.77,00:12:51.77,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: First part of today's"
202,00:12:54.00,00:12:54.00,"reward... is a grill, utensils. Make it a little easier,"
203,00:12:58.37,00:12:58.37,"anyway. Put this over your fire, put"
204,00:13:00.13,00:13:00.13,your fish or whatever meat you have.
205,00:13:01.80,00:13:01.80,"And I'm sure the fish is starting to get a little bland,"
206,00:13:05.17,00:13:05.17,"so, a few spices. Got some chili pepper, got some"
207,00:13:07.07,00:13:07.07,"parsley, salt and pepper, little bit of everything."
208,00:13:09.20,00:13:09.20,"Should, if you know what you're doing, spice it up a little bit."
209,00:13:12.73,00:13:12.73,And if you're getting tired of fish... nice big lobster.
210,00:13:17.50,00:13:17.50,">> Oh, lobster. That's exactly what I said."
211,00:13:20.53,00:13:20.53,>> PROBST: And if you're just tired of seafood altogether...
212,00:13:23.20,00:13:23.20,here's a little steak. (gasps and laughter)

215,00:13:33.10,00:13:33.10,"Also, the winning tribe gets to loot one item from the losing"
216,00:13:36.33,00:13:36.33,tribe. Give you a minute for strategy.
217,00:13:38.73,00:13:38.73,"Wait for my ""Go."" Here we go, guys."
218,00:13:45.73,00:13:45.73,First two up: Jon and Savage. First tribe to knock out the
219,00:13:50.30,00:13:50.30,other tribe's four targets wins surf n' turf.

221,00:14:01.23,00:14:01.23,"Now, the critical phase: aiming the cannon."
222,00:14:04.13,00:14:04.13,You have ropes you can use. You also can tilt or lower.
223,00:14:10.93,00:14:10.93,Andrew likes his already. >> What do you think?
224,00:14:13.47,00:14:13.47,">> I think that's it. >> PROBST: All right, Savage,"
225,00:14:15.17,00:14:15.17,which one are you going for? >> Front right.

232,00:14:33.00,00:14:33.00,Going for the orange one. Here we go.
233,00:14:35.77,00:14:35.77,Ready? Fire.

238,00:14:53.20,00:14:53.20,"Boom, he connects. Morgan on the board with one."

252,00:15:37.83,00:15:37.83,>> Good job. >> PROBST: And he does.
253,00:15:40.17,00:15:40.17,"Rupert, grab your fire. Ready?"
254,00:15:43.90,00:15:43.90,Fire. He nails it!
255,00:15:49.03,00:15:49.03,"Next two, come on down. Drake, one target away from"
256,00:15:53.30,00:15:53.30,surf n' turf. Darrah gets loaded.

265,00:16:26.93,00:16:26.93,Savage and Christa. Here's where things stand:
266,00:16:31.00,00:16:31.00,We're tied at 3-3. Morgan will shoot first.
267,00:16:33.80,00:16:33.80,"You connect, you have all four."
268,00:16:36.03,00:16:36.03,Drake still gets their last shot.
269,00:16:38.70,00:16:38.70,Savage tweaking. A lot at stake on these two
270,00:16:45.00,00:16:45.00,shots. Christa eyeballing.
271,00:16:47.47,00:16:47.47,Both tribes happy? >> Yeah.
272,00:16:51.40,00:16:51.40,>> PROBST: Andrew... Ready? Fire.

276,00:17:04.60,00:17:04.60,turf is going home with Drake. Ready?
277,00:17:09.07,00:17:09.07,Fire. (cheering)
278,00:17:12.90,00:17:12.90,>> PROBST: And she does! Drake wins reward!
279,00:17:19.40,00:17:19.40,>> Drake! Drake! Drake! >> PROBST: Drake!
280,00:17:26.30,00:17:26.30,"Beef, lobster, spices. You guys will take this home"
281,00:17:33.93,00:17:33.93,"with you. Tomorrow morning,"
282,00:17:35.97,00:17:35.97,you'll be sending somebody over to Morgan to loot one
283,00:17:37.87,00:17:37.87,item. Enjoy-- bon apetit.
284,00:17:39.90,00:17:39.90,"(cheering) >> Oh, look at these steaks,"
285,00:17:42.53,00:17:42.53,man! >> PROBST: Morgan.
286,00:17:44.37,00:17:44.37,Grab your tribe flag and head on back to camp.
287,00:18:13.33,00:18:13.33,(Drake cheering) >> Surf and turf.
288,00:18:20.07,00:18:20.07,Steak and lobster and spices! >> Look at these little fellas
289,00:18:24.03,00:18:24.03,right here. And they ain't little.
290,00:18:25.63,00:18:25.63,Look at our spices... Rosemary. Garlic sauce.
291,00:18:27.83,00:18:27.83,"Wait, wait. >> The piece de resistance:"
292,00:18:29.83,00:18:29.83,">> Beef. We got beef. >> I mean, it was just like a"
293,00:18:31.70,00:18:31.70,"dream come true. And when we came back here,"
294,00:18:33.97,00:18:33.97,everyone seasoned up their own meat and made their own steaks
295,00:18:36.90,00:18:36.90,and it was unbelievable. I think the lobsters are done.
296,00:18:40.27,00:18:40.27,"For sure. >> God, they look so good,"
297,00:18:44.40,00:18:44.40,"Shawn. Oh, my God."
298,00:18:46.27,00:18:46.27,>> It felt good coming home with all that stuff.
299,00:18:49.40,00:18:49.40,We tore it up. We cooked the lobster first.
300,00:18:51.97,00:18:51.97,">> Oh, man! That's cooked perfectly."
301,00:18:53.83,00:18:53.83,">> I can't believe after all this, we still got steak, guys."
302,00:18:57.63,00:18:57.63,">> Then, came around to the steak."
303,00:19:01.20,00:19:01.20,">> This is so good, you guys. >> And I just picked it up"
304,00:19:04.57,00:19:04.57,off the grill and I just ate it off the fork.
305,00:19:06.13,00:19:06.13,It was so delicious. It was the greatest steak I've
306,00:19:08.30,00:19:08.30,ever had. This is the bomb.
307,00:19:30.53,00:19:30.53,>> You're going to have to get up in a few minutes and go loot.
308,00:19:33.57,00:19:33.57,Okay? >> Okay. I'll get up.
309,00:19:34.97,00:19:34.97,>> You want to wake up. >> I'm about to go lootin'
310,00:19:40.20,00:19:40.20,and takin' some of that old pirate's booty.
311,00:19:41.87,00:19:41.87,I'm going to have fun today. Their morale is pretty low as a
312,00:19:45.37,00:19:45.37,result of losing the reward challenge.
313,00:19:48.47,00:19:48.47,"Uh, so, I... I plan on taking that morale and jumping on it,"
314,00:19:51.97,00:19:51.97,just up and down so it's absolutely nothing come
315,00:19:54.20,00:19:54.20,immunity time. That's the goal.
316,00:20:15.30,00:20:15.30,>> Who's that? >> Jon.
317,00:20:17.87,00:20:17.87,>> Is it? >> It's too early for me.
318,00:20:24.20,00:20:24.20,(laughs) >> He's an irritant.
319,00:20:26.20,00:20:26.20,"And he's rude. >> Okay, T, unclench your fists."
320,00:20:29.37,00:20:29.37,"(laughs) >> What's up, Big Jon?"
321,00:20:33.37,00:20:33.37,What's up? >> Little Jon from Drake
322,00:20:35.23,00:20:35.23,came to our camp to raid it. He was a lot more humble than
323,00:20:39.67,00:20:39.67,he usually is. He looked like he put his
324,00:20:41.57,00:20:41.57,"diplomat hat on, remembered some of his people skills and he..."
325,00:20:43.83,00:20:43.83,he wasn't as cocky or as arrogant.
326,00:20:46.03,00:20:46.03,"So what are your thoughts today, Big Jon?"
327,00:20:47.77,00:20:47.77,"Everyone voted we have to take your pot, uh, as a strategic"
328,00:20:50.40,00:20:50.40,"move, in case you come after our pot."
329,00:20:53.20,00:20:53.20,>> I thought you were coming after the shower.
330,00:20:55.40,00:20:55.40,>> Nah. I... you know what? I would love to wash my
331,00:20:58.63,00:20:58.63,hair before I go. >> Then Little Jon indicated
332,00:21:00.37,00:21:00.37,nothing would make him happier than to have some shampoo to
333,00:21:03.33,00:21:03.33,"wash his hair. Gave him some shampoo,"
334,00:21:04.97,00:21:04.97,a diplomatic gesture on our part.
335,00:21:06.80,00:21:06.80,>> Awesome. Have you guys noticed
336,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,I've been a little nicer at challenges?
337,00:21:11.57,00:21:11.57,">> We don't mind talking smack, but it hurts when you lose six"
338,00:21:14.77,00:21:14.77,straight challenges. >> Oh.
339,00:21:16.27,00:21:16.27,">> If we were winning those challenges, talking smack"
340,00:21:19.90,00:21:19.90,doesn't bother me. It just...
341,00:21:21.53,00:21:21.53,">> Well, technically, seven. We threw the seventh one"
342,00:21:27.00,00:21:27.00,"just to get Burton out. Like, I mean, did you notice"
343,00:21:31.60,00:21:31.60,"that I... I moved my guys out of the way? But, anyway..."
344,00:21:35.13,00:21:35.13,"I'll be right back. >> Throwing the challenge, him."
345,00:21:39.73,00:21:39.73,>> Seven is what he said. >> Him.
346,00:21:42.93,00:21:42.93,>> Who said that? >> He said he... they threw the
347,00:21:46.07,00:21:46.07,"challenge for that piece... chess piece, as if they"
348,00:21:48.30,00:21:48.30,"weren't trying. >> Yeah, right."
349,00:21:49.67,00:21:49.67,">> The whole time. >> He screwed up, majorly."
350,00:21:51.30,00:21:51.30,>> He claims he threw the Chess-Checker Water Challenge.
351,00:21:53.50,00:21:53.50,I think that's just nonsense and I think it's bad sportsmanship
352,00:21:56.47,00:21:56.47,"for him, little bastard, to indicate that we didn't fair and"
353,00:21:58.90,00:21:58.90,"square win that challenge. So, I don't think they did throw"
354,00:22:03.00,00:22:03.00,it.  But just for that little pissant
355,00:22:04.33,00:22:04.33,"to take that away from us, it's ridiculous."
356,00:22:08.77,00:22:08.77,">> Bye, guys. >> Bye."
357,00:22:10.70,00:22:10.70,">> You know, he came here to ruffle some feathers and he"
358,00:22:14.03,00:22:14.03,"definitely did. Hey, say ""hey"" to Rupert for us."
359,00:22:16.00,00:22:16.00,>> I will. >> And it concerned me from an
360,00:22:18.57,00:22:18.57,"immunity standpoint, because the most critical one coming up"
361,00:22:21.23,00:22:21.23,"today, that he's causing dissension among the ranks."
362,00:22:24.63,00:22:24.63,And let the games begin. Let's take the gloves off and
363,00:22:27.57,00:22:27.57,let's see what they're made of. Let's have some fun.
364,00:22:42.03,00:22:42.03,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! What's going on, Rupert?"
365,00:22:44.90,00:22:44.90,">> ( laughs ): Play time. >> PROBST: What's up, T?"
366,00:22:47.43,00:22:47.43,">> Hey. >> PROBST: Christa, getting more"
367,00:22:51.47,00:22:51.47,bug bites. >> I don't know what happened to
368,00:22:54.03,00:22:54.03,me last night. I guess I just have some new
369,00:22:56.93,00:22:56.93,freckles that have developed. It's cool.
370,00:22:59.10,00:22:59.10,">> PROBST: All right, first things first."
371,00:23:01.70,00:23:01.70,"Immunity... back up for grabs. Okay, today's immunity challenge"
372,00:23:08.50,00:23:08.50,will require strategy and endurance.
373,00:23:13.33,00:23:13.33,Three tribe members from each tribe will have a wooden pole
374,00:23:17.70,00:23:17.70,"across their shoulders. Each round, weight will be added"
375,00:23:20.10,00:23:20.10,to those poles until you cannot take it any longer.
376,00:23:24.23,00:23:24.23,That's the endurance portion. But the decision of which
377,00:23:28.13,00:23:28.13,tribe member gets the weight added to their shoulders will
378,00:23:30.80,00:23:30.80,be made by only two members from the opposing tribe.
379,00:23:33.50,00:23:33.50,That's the strategy. Once you can't hold the weight
380,00:23:35.93,00:23:35.93,"any longer, drop the pole, you're out of the game."
381,00:23:38.67,00:23:38.67,Last person left standing wins immunity for their tribe.
382,00:23:42.63,00:23:42.63,"Drake, because you have one extra member, you're sitting"
383,00:23:44.73,00:23:44.73,somebody out. Sandra's sitting out.
384,00:23:46.00,00:23:46.00,"All right. Wait for my ""Go."""
385,00:23:53.53,00:23:53.53,"All right, guys. We'll be working in 20-pound"
386,00:23:54.33,00:23:54.33,increments. Each bag weighs ten pounds.
387,00:23:56.67,00:23:56.67,You'll put two bags on each person.
388,00:23:58.90,00:23:58.90,"Drake, where you putting your first 20 pounds?"
389,00:24:00.83,00:24:00.83,">> Osten. >> PROBST: Morgan, where you"
390,00:24:02.63,00:24:02.63,putting your first 20? >> Rupert.
391,00:24:04.03,00:24:04.03,>> PROBST: Rupert. All right. Grab your bags.
392,00:24:08.40,00:24:08.40,Put them on. Let them go.
393,00:24:14.77,00:24:14.77,"Next 20 pounds. Morgan, where's it going?"
394,00:24:17.17,00:24:17.17,>> Rupert. >> Osten.
395,00:24:22.23,00:24:22.23,>> PROBST: Where's the next 20 going-- Morgan?
396,00:24:25.80,00:24:25.80,>> Rupert. >> PROBST: Savage.
397,00:24:28.60,00:24:28.60,All right. Drake dividing it up a little.
398,00:24:31.00,00:24:31.00,Rupert going to take another 20 and Savage getting his
399,00:24:33.30,00:24:33.30,"first 20. Morgan, who's your next 20?"
400,00:24:37.17,00:24:37.17,>> Rupert. >> PROBST: Rupert.
401,00:24:39.47,00:24:39.47,>> Savage. >> PROBST: Savage.
402,00:24:41.03,00:24:41.03,"Remember, you have a limited amount of weight,"
403,00:24:42.77,00:24:42.77,"600 pounds, to allocate. Rupert at 80 pounds, Osten at 40"
404,00:24:45.57,00:24:45.57,"pounds, Savage at 40 pounds. Morgan?"
405,00:24:48.27,00:24:48.27,>> Rupert. >> PROBST: Rupert again.
406,00:24:51.43,00:24:51.43,>> Osten. >> PROBST: Osten.
407,00:24:52.80,00:24:52.80,Now it looks like we're going with the same strategy on both
408,00:24:55.20,00:24:55.20,"tribes. Rupert's at 140 pounds,"
409,00:25:00.63,00:25:00.63,"Osten's at a hundred pounds, Savage at 40."
410,00:25:03.10,00:25:03.10,"Osten, how you feeling? >> All right."
411,00:25:06.00,00:25:06.00,>> PROBST: Let's put some more weight on.
412,00:25:08.20,00:25:08.20,">> I hate doing this, Rupe. (exhales)"
413,00:25:11.43,00:25:11.43,">> PROBST: Once again, Rupert and Osten showing down."
414,00:25:14.40,00:25:14.40,(growls) >> It ain't lasting.
415,00:25:23.53,00:25:23.53,">> Keep it up, Osten. You got it."
416,00:25:25.77,00:25:25.77,">> You got it, Osten. >> PROBST: Rupert at 200 pounds"
417,00:25:27.67,00:25:27.67,now. Making a risky move by taking
418,00:25:29.87,00:25:29.87,"his hands off that bar. >> He's in pain, too, Rupert."
419,00:25:33.50,00:25:33.50,">> Keep focus, Osten. >> You looking good, Rupert."
420,00:25:36.13,00:25:36.13,">> He's trembling. >> PROBST: Osten at 160, plus"
421,00:25:38.97,00:25:38.97,"that bar is another 15, plus the pain you feel in the back of"
422,00:25:42.57,00:25:42.57,your neck. Both men struggling.
423,00:25:43.93,00:25:43.93,It's going to come down to will. >> He's done!
424,00:25:49.50,00:25:49.50,">> He's out. >> PROBST: And like that, Osten"
425,00:25:51.30,00:25:51.30,"is out. >> Stay in, Rupe."
426,00:25:52.43,00:25:52.43,">> PROBST: Take a seat, Osten. >> It's all right, Osten."
427,00:25:54.27,00:25:54.27,(groans) >> PROBST: Put some more weight.
428,00:25:58.70,00:25:58.70,>> Rupert. >> PROBST: Rupert.
429,00:26:00.63,00:26:00.63,>> Savage. >> PROBST: Savage.
430,00:26:03.60,00:26:03.60,(grunts) >> PROBST: Rupert has lost his
431,00:26:10.90,00:26:10.90,"pole. >> All right, good job, Rupe."
432,00:26:13.00,00:26:13.00,Good job. >> PROBST: The strategy worked
433,00:26:15.27,00:26:15.27,"for both tribes, heavy up on the strongest guy."
434,00:26:17.77,00:26:17.77,"Both strong guys are out. Have a seat on your crate, Rupe."
435,00:26:21.03,00:26:21.03,"All right, let's give somebody else some weight."
436,00:26:22.67,00:26:22.67,>> Savage. >> Savage.
437,00:26:24.30,00:26:24.30,>> Shawn. >> PROBST: Drake going to heavy
438,00:26:27.07,00:26:27.07,up on Savage. Morgan spreading the weight
439,00:26:28.83,00:26:28.83,around. That's going to start getting
440,00:26:30.80,00:26:30.80,heavy. That's a lot of weight
441,00:26:34.10,00:26:34.10,and an uncomfortable bar on the back of your neck.
442,00:26:37.10,00:26:37.10,>> Got to break one of them. >> O.T. was saying Shawn first.
443,00:26:40.60,00:26:40.60,>> PROBST: Let's add some weight.
444,00:26:42.17,00:26:42.17,>> Shawn. >> Savage.
445,00:26:46.37,00:26:46.37,>> We're breaking him right here.
446,00:26:52.33,00:26:52.33,>> PROBST: Let's add some weight.
447,00:26:53.57,00:26:53.57,>> Shawn. >> Ryno.
448,00:26:57.70,00:26:57.70,>> PROBST: Ryno finally in the game with 20 pounds.
449,00:27:04.83,00:27:04.83,"Shawn's carrying 120, Savage still holding strong at 160."
450,00:27:12.10,00:27:12.10,"(indistinct encouragement) >> Hang in there, Shawn."
451,00:27:15.13,00:27:15.13,">> PROBST: Shawn now at 140, still 20 pounds less than"
452,00:27:18.30,00:27:18.30,Savage. >> Give him some more.
453,00:27:21.20,00:27:21.20,">> No, don't need to-- Ryno. >> He's going to break."
454,00:27:25.37,00:27:25.37,>> He's done. >> PROBST: Savage has somehow
455,00:27:28.33,00:27:28.33,managed to hang in for a long time at 160 pounds.
456,00:27:31.83,00:27:31.83,">> You got it, Shawn. This contest was made for you."
457,00:27:36.83,00:27:36.83,">> PROBST: And with that, Shawn is out at 140 pounds."
458,00:27:40.17,00:27:40.17,"Savage, still holding strong at 160, a weight he has been at"
459,00:27:43.37,00:27:43.37,"twice as long as anybody else. >> Come on, Morgan!"
460,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,>> PROBST: Let's add some weight.
461,00:27:53.77,00:27:53.77,It is down to Christa versus two strong Morgan guys.
462,00:28:03.17,00:28:03.17,">> Hang in there, Christa. >> PROBST: Very impressive."
463,00:28:05.53,00:28:05.53,"Christa now at the same weight Osten dropped out at, 160."
464,00:28:09.73,00:28:09.73,Same weight Andrew's been at for 15 minutes.
465,00:28:11.87,00:28:11.87,Ryno at 140. This is where you have to
466,00:28:14.57,00:28:14.57,fight through the pain or give in.
467,00:28:17.13,00:28:17.13,>> It's just too much on the human body.
468,00:28:20.63,00:28:20.63,>> PROBST: Let's add some weight.
469,00:28:21.83,00:28:21.83,>> Savage. >> PROBST: Drake changing up.
470,00:28:26.50,00:28:26.50,Trish doesn't like the decision.
471,00:28:29.60,00:28:29.60,Big strategic move and it was one that was not agreed on.
472,00:28:32.87,00:28:32.87,>> She's going to fall. Right here.
473,00:28:34.93,00:28:34.93,"Right here, she's falling. >> Stay in there."
474,00:28:40.30,00:28:40.30,Stay in there. >> PROBST: Got to fight through
475,00:28:42.80,00:28:42.80,it. She can't do it.
476,00:28:44.60,00:28:44.60,"Morgan wins immunity! >> It's okay, mama."
477,00:28:47.20,00:28:47.20,>> You did your best. You had 160 pounds.
478,00:28:59.03,00:28:59.03,">> PROBST: Morgan, it's going back home with you again."
479,00:29:01.93,00:29:01.93,You should give that to Savage. Well earned.
480,00:29:05.97,00:29:05.97,>> Give it a kiss. >> PROBST: You got tears in your
481,00:29:08.83,00:29:08.83,eyes-- you all right? Feel good?
482,00:29:12.43,00:29:12.43,"(Andrew sniffles) Drake, I know you weren't"
483,00:29:16.07,00:29:16.07,"planning on going to Tribal Council, but you are."
484,00:29:18.47,00:29:18.47,"Somebody's going home and, after tonight, we'll be even:"
485,00:29:20.63,00:29:20.63,five-five. You have this afternoon to think
486,00:29:22.73,00:29:22.73,about that vote. Head on back to camp.
487,00:29:53.77,00:29:53.77,">> I should have stood up there longer, guys."
488,00:29:55.70,00:29:55.70,That's all I got to say. We wouldn't have this problem.
489,00:29:57.83,00:29:57.83,>> Everybody did as much as they could.
490,00:30:00.03,00:30:00.03,">> That was the worst, pitifulest-ass performance I've"
491,00:30:02.17,00:30:02.17,"ever seen. He deserves to go home, if"
492,00:30:05.67,00:30:05.67,"nothing else, for that. I am very irritated with"
493,00:30:08.20,00:30:08.20,Shawn. I want him off my island and
494,00:30:11.23,00:30:11.23,out of my adventure. We may just go fishing.
495,00:30:20.13,00:30:20.13,>> All I know is one person has a hell of a lot of power right
496,00:30:23.50,00:30:23.50,now. >> Yep.
497,00:30:25.63,00:30:25.63,">> It's not right. I mean, just so much power."
498,00:30:28.03,00:30:28.03,">> Yep. >> It's like, he could pretty"
499,00:30:30.90,00:30:30.90,"much do whatever he wants to, frankly, and we're all sort of"
500,00:30:34.17,00:30:34.17,following along. >> Jon and Trish feel insecure
501,00:30:36.03,00:30:36.03,"about Rupert's power within the tribe, because Rupert is the man"
502,00:30:38.97,00:30:38.97,"in charge here. >> You know, I love Rupe, but"
503,00:30:43.57,00:30:43.57,there's something that is just not feeling right to me about
504,00:30:46.50,00:30:46.50,this whole thing. >> Agreed.
505,00:30:50.73,00:30:50.73,">> You know, if anybody could jump to Morgan and survive, it"
506,00:30:53.83,00:30:53.83,"would be Rupert. With us, he could go all the"
507,00:30:58.13,00:30:58.13,"way, and with them, he could go all the way."
508,00:31:00.43,00:31:00.43,"I mean, what do you guys think? I-I-I don't... you know..."
509,00:31:03.17,00:31:03.17,">> Christa won't go for it. >> Well, we don't have..."
510,00:31:05.00,00:31:05.00,we don't need Christa. >> We're not telling her.
511,00:31:06.70,00:31:06.70,>> We're not telling. >> We're not telling Christa.
512,00:31:08.10,00:31:08.10,"All we need... all we need is, uh, us three and Shawn."
513,00:31:09.77,00:31:09.77,Shawn will say yes in a heartbeat.
514,00:31:13.27,00:31:13.27,>> What do you think? >> What are the ramifications if
515,00:31:16.07,00:31:16.07,we do? >> Food.
516,00:31:17.50,00:31:17.50,">> For a million dollars, can you starve for 19 days?"
517,00:31:22.03,00:31:22.03,>> Yes. >> So it's a done deal?
518,00:31:27.00,00:31:27.00,>> I guess so. It has to be.
519,00:31:29.90,00:31:29.90,It's the smartest way we can play this game right now.
520,00:31:32.93,00:31:32.93,>> The more we talked about it and the more we
521,00:31:34.90,00:31:34.90,"fleshed it out, the better I felt, the better Jon felt, and"
522,00:31:37.10,00:31:37.10,"the better Sandra felt. Jon didn't want to tell Christa,"
523,00:31:39.60,00:31:39.60,because we don't need her vote. Shawn-- we're going to tell him
524,00:31:41.90,00:31:41.90,at the last minute that his neck has been saved.
525,00:31:44.23,00:31:44.23,This is the biggest shock of all-- that we have all come to
526,00:31:47.70,00:31:47.70,"this conclusion on Rupert. Tonight, it's going to be a"
527,00:31:50.37,00:31:50.37,really big surprise. Rupert's going to be the one
528,00:31:52.77,00:31:52.77,"gone and not Shawn. >> Oh, man, this is crazy now."
529,00:31:54.87,00:31:54.87,First it was Shawn. Now we're down to Rupert.
530,00:31:58.87,00:31:58.87,>> Rupert would never do us wrong.
531,00:32:01.37,00:32:01.37,I trust him. >> I'd rather keep the tribe
532,00:32:03.63,00:32:03.63,strong just a little while longer.
533,00:32:06.03,00:32:06.03,>> Rupert. >> Huh?
534,00:32:12.50,00:32:12.50,>> They're planning on getting rid of you tonight.
535,00:32:14.30,00:32:14.30,They're not going to go with Shawn.
536,00:32:16.00,00:32:16.00,They've changed. Jon and Trish-- they want you
537,00:32:17.63,00:32:17.63,out. >> I can't believe that Jon and
538,00:32:23.03,00:32:23.03,Trish are trying to get me out before even the merge.
539,00:32:25.53,00:32:25.53,"We do not even know when the merge is going to be, and"
540,00:32:28.67,00:32:28.67,they're trying to get me out. Jon and Trish are going to
541,00:32:33.43,00:32:33.43,come try and sway you and get them... you to vote me.
542,00:32:35.47,00:32:35.47,That's still only going to be three votes.
543,00:32:37.37,00:32:37.37,>> Right. >> And it'll be a tie.
544,00:32:38.83,00:32:38.83,>> Right. >> Three against three.
545,00:32:39.97,00:32:39.97,>> So I should say yes. >> You write Trish down.
546,00:32:42.20,00:32:42.20,>> Say yes to voting you... >> Say yes to voting me.
547,00:32:44.20,00:32:44.20,">> And then write Trish. >> Then write Trish down, and"
548,00:32:45.90,00:32:45.90,Trish is out fo-four to two. >> And then you and I are going
549,00:32:48.53,00:32:48.53,to take this one home? >> Hell yeah.
550,00:32:50.57,00:32:50.57,">> I'm with you on that, baby. >> I was pretty upset because I"
551,00:32:53.03,00:32:53.03,"thought I was going home. Then I talked to Rupert,"
552,00:32:56.93,00:32:56.93,"and he found out that the plot wasn't to get me off tonight,"
553,00:33:00.40,00:33:00.40,but to get him off. And he came running back here to
554,00:33:03.60,00:33:03.60,"say, ""It's you and me. Let's get rid of Trish."
555,00:33:06.27,00:33:06.27,"She's the bad apple."" So we'll see."
556,00:33:08.27,00:33:08.27,"Wait, who's taking a ride? Rupe? Rupert?"
557,00:33:11.50,00:33:11.50,>> Yep. >> Where'd that come from?
558,00:33:13.80,00:33:13.80,>> Had to do something. There's no way anyone can go
559,00:33:16.50,00:33:16.50,against Rupert to the final two. It'd be a landslide.
560,00:33:19.20,00:33:19.20,"It'd be a freakin' K. O., man. You got to do what you got to"
561,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,do. >> That is for sure.
562,00:33:24.50,00:33:24.50,"In this game, you have to do what you got to do."
563,00:33:27.17,00:33:27.17,">> Exactly, so I trust you more than any of them, so..."
564,00:33:30.13,00:33:30.13,">> If you don't do what you got to do in this game, somebody"
565,00:33:33.10,00:33:33.10,could take you for a ride. >> Yep.
566,00:33:34.83,00:33:34.83,"Everyone's really ready to vote off Shawn, but Shawn's a"
567,00:33:37.83,00:33:37.83,good ally for me. Rupert?
568,00:33:39.87,00:33:39.87,"Uh, good guy, but I'm not signing my million dollar check"
569,00:33:42.80,00:33:42.80,"to him, so that's the way the game's played."
570,00:33:47.23,00:33:47.23,">> Remember I said, ""You look out for my back, I'll look out"
571,00:33:50.73,00:33:50.73,"for yours""? That's what we're doing."
572,00:33:54.47,00:33:54.47,Little do they know what's really going to happen.
573,00:33:57.13,00:33:57.13,I think everyone is going to be very shocked.
574,00:33:59.53,00:33:59.53,Everyone. (chuckles)
575,00:34:19.30,00:34:19.30,">> PROBST: Well, judging by how confident you guys act at"
576,00:34:21.80,00:34:21.80,challenges and seeing that today's immunity challenge was
577,00:34:27.40,00:34:27.40,"physical, I know you were not expecting to be here again"
578,00:34:30.70,00:34:30.70,tonight. Sandra?
579,00:34:32.57,00:34:32.57,>> Definitely not. We were on full tummies.
580,00:34:36.63,00:34:36.63,"Our motivation was up there. We were like, ""There's no way."
581,00:34:40.10,00:34:40.10,"""They're dying ""of hunger. ""They don't have it together."
582,00:34:43.47,00:34:43.47,"There's no way we can get beat. No way."""
583,00:34:45.93,00:34:45.93,>> PROBST: Let's talk about today's challenge.
584,00:34:47.50,00:34:47.50,"Christa, you outlasted a lot of people, including Morgan's"
585,00:34:49.90,00:34:49.90,"strongest guy, Osten. You had as much weight as he did"
586,00:34:52.87,00:34:52.87,when he dropped out. >> The challenge was hard.
587,00:34:56.10,00:34:56.10,I... didn't think that I actually could pull that much
588,00:35:03.33,00:35:03.33,"weight, but, uh, I did. And it sucked to drop it,"
589,00:35:07.70,00:35:07.70,though. >> PROBST: Rupert... I'd be
590,00:35:09.40,00:35:09.40,lying if I didn't say you looked incredibly sad.
591,00:35:13.27,00:35:13.27,Your eyes are sunken. Your smile is gone.
592,00:35:17.07,00:35:17.07,>> 'Cause I'm ready to cry. >> PROBST: What's that?
593,00:35:18.53,00:35:18.53,>> I'm ready to cry. >> PROBST: Why?
594,00:35:22.70,00:35:22.70,>> We shouldn't be here. >> PROBST: So are you upset
595,00:35:27.17,00:35:27.17,about losing? Are you upset about where the
596,00:35:29.33,00:35:29.33,tribe is? >> I'm upset the way the tribe
597,00:35:32.13,00:35:32.13,"has gone. We started out so strong, and"
598,00:35:35.90,00:35:35.90,now we are not. And it's hard to pull everybody
599,00:35:41.80,00:35:41.80,together. >> PROBST: Are you losing hope
600,00:35:44.03,00:35:44.03,that that can happen? You can't lose hope.
601,00:35:50.97,00:35:50.97,You got to believe that you can.
602,00:35:55.97,00:35:55.97,We'll lose one person tonight. I hope it's not me.
603,00:36:00.30,00:36:00.30,"And maybe then, we'll try and build a stronger Drake tribe."
604,00:36:03.10,00:36:03.10,>> PROBST: Why would it be you tonight?
605,00:36:05.10,00:36:05.10,>> I think my tribe sees me now as unneeded.
606,00:36:08.50,00:36:08.50,They have gotten it in their heads-- even though I'm trying
607,00:36:16.07,00:36:16.07,desperately to make them believe there is no
608,00:36:19.80,00:36:19.80,"certainties of a merge, there is no certainties of anything"
609,00:36:22.23,00:36:22.23,"in this game-- that if I make it to the end, they can't beat me."
610,00:36:26.73,00:36:26.73,"Uh, if I make it to the merge, I'll win a lot of the"
611,00:36:30.33,00:36:30.33,immunities; they can't beat me. Doesn't give a damn if I catch
612,00:36:33.30,00:36:33.30,them ten pounds of fish a day. I know at least half my tribe
613,00:36:35.47,00:36:35.47,"wants me gone. >> PROBST: Trish, when you hear"
614,00:36:38.10,00:36:38.10,"a guy like this, who's been a strong member of your tribe,"
615,00:36:40.97,00:36:40.97,"feel like half the tribe has turned on him, what are your"
616,00:36:43.70,00:36:43.70,thoughts? >> I'm surprised to hear him say
617,00:36:46.20,00:36:46.20,"that, to tell you the truth. I didn't know he felt that way"
618,00:36:56.60,00:36:56.60,"at all. So, to hear him talk like that,"
619,00:36:58.87,00:36:58.87,"you know, it's-it's, um... sad to me."
620,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,I had no idea that that's the way he felt.
621,00:37:03.17,00:37:03.17,>> PROBST: Is it hard for you to vote somebody out tonight?
622,00:37:05.17,00:37:05.17,>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. It's really hard for me to vote
623,00:37:06.90,00:37:06.90,"somebody out tonight. >> PROBST: Sandra, how sure are"
624,00:37:08.83,00:37:08.83,"you that it's not you tonight? >> Oh, I know it ain't me."
625,00:37:16.40,00:37:16.40,(laughing) The person that's going home
626,00:37:18.20,00:37:18.20,today is the one that least expects it.
627,00:37:20.37,00:37:20.37,It's the person that in the past couple of days has been giving
628,00:37:23.30,00:37:23.30,so many different stories that we don't know what the heck to
629,00:37:25.50,00:37:25.50,"believe. This person will be missed, but,"
630,00:37:28.03,00:37:28.03,"for the good of the tribe, this person has got to go home."
631,00:37:30.70,00:37:30.70,"(laughter) >> PROBST: With that, it is"
632,00:37:37.63,00:37:37.63,"time to vote. Christa, you're up."
633,00:37:52.87,00:37:52.87,>> (whispering): You stabbed us all in the back.
634,00:37:56.23,00:37:56.23,"You have no idea how to play this game, but good try."
635,00:37:59.47,00:37:59.47,"See you later. >> Everybody's got a price,"
636,00:38:12.63,00:38:12.63,"everybody's got to pay, 'cause a million dollar man always gets"
637,00:38:15.57,00:38:15.57,his way. >> I've always said you were a
638,00:38:29.00,00:38:29.00,"snake from day one. Um, you can't be trusted, so,"
639,00:38:31.50,00:38:31.50,"um, good-bye, adios. >> Rupert, I'm voting you out"
640,00:38:44.07,00:38:44.07,because I think you just have too much power with the other
641,00:38:47.33,00:38:47.33,"tribe, and it just seems to me that you are straddling both"
642,00:38:50.57,00:38:50.57,tribes. >> I cannot believe that you
643,00:39:01.57,00:39:01.57,turned on me so quickly. Everybody in my tribe tells me
644,00:39:05.50,00:39:05.50,"that you want me out, and you lie right to my face."
645,00:39:08.63,00:39:08.63,I can't take that. >> You know what?
646,00:39:20.40,00:39:20.40,"Game's over for you. It's my game now, so good-bye."
647,00:39:33.70,00:39:33.70,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
648,00:39:47.60,00:39:47.60,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
649,00:39:49.37,00:39:49.37,The person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal
650,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,Council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
651,00:39:57.83,00:39:57.83,First vote-- Trish.
652,00:40:05.40,00:40:05.40,Rupert. Trish.
653,00:40:13.67,00:40:13.67,"That's two votes Trish, one vote Rupert."
654,00:40:18.57,00:40:18.57,"Rupert. Two votes Rupert, two votes"
655,00:40:21.23,00:40:21.23,Trish. Three votes Trish.
656,00:40:28.70,00:40:28.70,The sixth person voted out of the Pearl Islands-- Trish.
657,00:40:32.97,00:40:32.97,You need to bring me your torch.
658,00:40:41.57,00:40:41.57,"Trish, the tribe has spoken. It's time for you to go."
659,00:41:00.77,00:41:00.77,"Well, the one thing that came out of tonight's Tribal Council"
660,00:41:03.10,00:41:03.10,is that there are very few things that are certain in
661,00:41:06.17,00:41:06.17,this game. One thing that is certain-- this
662,00:41:08.93,00:41:08.93,tribe has been to Tribal Council three times in a row.
663,00:41:11.87,00:41:11.87,"You are now down to five members, same as the Morgan"
664,00:41:14.50,00:41:14.50,tribe. 21 days left.
665,00:41:17.13,00:41:17.13,It is anybody's game. Grab your torches.
666,00:41:21.47,00:41:21.47,Head back to camp. Stay tuned for scenes from our
667,00:41:41.37,00:41:41.37,next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
668,00:41:46.90,00:41:46.90,Survivor... >> Who the hell voted for me?
669,00:41:49.10,00:41:49.10,>> I did. >> You ... me!
670,00:41:51.07,00:41:51.07,Jonny Fairplay is Jonny Pain-in-the-ass now to me.
671,00:41:53.50,00:41:53.50,">> PROBST: At Morgan... >> O.T., this morning, he"
672,00:41:55.73,00:41:55.73,"checked out. I could see in his eyes, he's"
673,00:41:57.60,00:41:57.60,throwing in the towel again. >> PROBST: And Morgan and Drake
674,00:41:59.87,00:41:59.87,are in for a big twist. Your past has come back to
675,00:42:02.63,00:42:02.63,haunt you. >> I didn't see this coming at 
676,00:42:12.03,00:42:12.03,"all, obviously. But I always knew that anything"
677,00:42:14.93,00:42:14.93,"can happen. And so, I really never took"
678,00:42:17.50,00:42:17.50,anything for granted. Hats off to the Drake Tribe.
679,00:42:20.07,00:42:20.07,I think you guys are all great. I hope one of the Drakes end up
680,00:42:22.97,00:42:22.97,"winning the million dollars. Good for you guys, you kept a"
681,00:42:25.43,00:42:25.43,"secret, and that's the beauty of this game-- you just never"
682,00:42:27.80,00:42:27.80,know what's going to happen and when it's going to happen.
