3,00:00:05.42,00:00:05.42,discovered a clue to the hidden immunity idol...
4,00:00:07.92,00:00:07.92,">> ""An immunity idol is hidden at your camp."""

6,00:00:12.58,00:00:12.58,>> Who's walking down that way? >> PROBST: ...each person
7,00:00:14.42,00:00:14.42,selfishly looking for the idol alone.
8,00:00:16.33,00:00:16.33,"Tom was the one to find it. >> I have the immunity idol, but"
9,00:00:19.71,00:00:19.71,"I'm still a target, because they know it's in my possession."
10,00:00:22.04,00:00:22.04,">> PROBST: Conversely, the Villains agreed to stick"
11,00:00:24.25,00:00:24.25,together and ignore the clue entirely.
12,00:00:26.25,00:00:26.25,>> It's not fair for one person to have an immunity idol.
13,00:00:28.71,00:00:28.71,">> PROBST: Except for Russell, who searched for the idol but"
14,00:00:31.42,00:00:31.42,couldn't find it. And instead found himself on
15,00:00:35.29,00:00:35.29,the outs with his tribe. >> PROBST: At the immunity
16,00:00:40.08,00:00:40.08,"challenge, Boston Rob once again led the Villains to victory."
17,00:00:44.38,00:00:44.38,"Villains win immunity! At the Heroes' camp, J.T. agreed"
18,00:00:48.58,00:00:48.58,to vote with Cirie and the majority of the tribe to take
19,00:00:51.33,00:00:51.33,out Tom. >> I want Tom to go.
20,00:00:53.29,00:00:53.29,">> PROBST: But at Tribal Council, J.T. betrayed his"
21,00:00:56.21,00:00:56.21,"alliance and voted for Cirie. >> Jeff, I have something that I"
22,00:00:59.62,00:00:59.62,was hoping not to use. >> PROBST: So when Tom played
23,00:01:01.79,00:01:01.79,"the hidden immunity idol, Cirie was sent home."
24,00:01:04.83,00:01:04.83,"Cirie, the tribe has spoken. I would say that qualifies as"
25,00:01:09.67,00:01:09.67,your first blindside. 16 are left.
26,00:01:12.92,00:01:12.92,"Who will be voted out tonight? >> Tonight, J.T. is a Hero."
27,00:01:28.33,00:01:28.33,"I really believed my days were done on the beach, but J.T. did"
28,00:01:32.42,00:01:32.42,"it. At this point, it's all about"
29,00:01:35.25,00:01:35.25,strategy. They've made it very clear they
30,00:01:37.71,00:01:37.71,wanted me and Tom gone. We're not gone yet.
31,00:01:41.08,00:01:41.08,We don't plan on going anywhere. >> Cirie's game's always been
32,00:01:55.38,00:01:55.38,she stays loyal until things get rough after the merge.
33,00:01:58.79,00:01:58.79,"And the way things are going, it's gonna get rough for us."
34,00:02:01.92,00:02:01.92,And I hope everybody realizes I did it for the team and not for
35,00:02:05.17,00:02:05.17,me. >> I'm a little pissed off right
36,00:02:08.12,00:02:08.12,now. (chuckles)
37,00:02:10.38,00:02:10.38,I'm a lot pissed off right now. Don't know about J.T. as much as
38,00:02:15.29,00:02:15.29,I did a few hours ago. >> They think I saved them.
39,00:02:30.79,00:02:30.79,I didn't. I got rid of Cirie when I had
40,00:02:33.12,00:02:33.12,"the chance. And I swear, I will never, never"
41,00:02:37.08,00:02:37.08,turn on you guys. Never. >> Really?
42,00:02:39.96,00:02:39.96,">> I swear. I swear, Amanda. I would never lie to you."
43,00:02:43.08,00:02:43.08,I swear. You don't believe me? I swear.
44,00:02:50.54,00:02:50.54,>> Okay. J.T. can tell me everything he
45,00:02:53.88,00:02:53.88,"wants to tell me, but I see right through him."
46,00:02:56.38,00:02:56.38,"In the back of my mind, I know that he will lie and he makes"
47,00:02:59.21,00:02:59.21,"alliances like they're, you know, yesterday's news."
48,00:03:03.25,00:03:03.25,I think he's made 20 alliances already.
49,00:03:05.50,00:03:05.50,"If he wants to play this game, game on."
50,00:03:08.04,00:03:08.04,Bring it on. (theme song playing)

52,00:04:29.04,00:04:29.04,And pull. The key is making your mind tell
53,00:04:34.42,00:04:34.42,you body to flex every muscle. I led the tribe out to the beach
54,00:04:38.17,00:04:38.17,this morning to do some dragon-slayer chi; my own
55,00:04:41.00,00:04:41.00,special form of meditation and movement.
56,00:04:44.88,00:04:44.88,Out to this side. Move your arms like this.
57,00:04:49.62,00:04:49.62,It's complete body control. If fuses everything together.
58,00:04:54.25,00:04:54.25,(Coach humming) It just basically tells your
59,00:05:03.25,00:05:03.25,mind and your body to get on the same page.
60,00:05:06.08,00:05:06.08,Keep the pressure on the fists. And they all seemed willing
61,00:05:09.46,00:05:09.46,to go. Everybody went except Russell.
62,00:05:11.58,00:05:11.58,>> Everybody this morning walks out on the beach doing a little
63,00:05:16.12,00:05:16.12,"Coach chi in a circle. You know, all that"
64,00:05:18.50,00:05:18.50,meditating crap. (Coach humming)
65,00:05:23.33,00:05:23.33,"While they meditating, getting ready for the challenge-- I"
66,00:05:25.88,00:05:25.88,guess that's what they were meditating for-- I'm looking
67,00:05:28.04,00:05:28.04,"for the hidden immunity idol. You know, it's a very important"
68,00:05:37.17,00:05:37.17,"tool, so I'm-a get it. I'm gonna find it."
69,00:06:05.04,00:06:05.04,It was right in my face. That's what I was afraid of.
70,00:06:11.04,00:06:11.04,"Today, everything changes. Everything."
71,00:06:14.46,00:06:14.46,Rob's not in control of this game right now.
72,00:06:17.08,00:06:17.08,This is my key. This is my key right here.
73,00:06:20.62,00:06:20.62,"And here it goes again. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
74,00:06:40.46,00:06:40.46,"Villains, getting your first look at the new Hero tribe."
75,00:06:43.21,00:06:43.21,Cirie voted out at the last Tribal Council.
76,00:06:51.25,00:06:51.25,"All right, you guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?"
77,00:06:53.92,00:06:53.92,>> Yes. >> Yes.
78,00:06:54.92,00:06:54.92,">> PROBST: For today's challenge, three members of each"
79,00:06:56.96,00:06:56.96,tribe will battle to retrieve balls in a pit.
80,00:06:59.92,00:06:59.92,"Will then toss them to your tribemates up on a platform, who"
81,00:07:02.92,00:07:02.92,will attempt to shoot the balls into a basket.
82,00:07:06.12,00:07:06.12,"Each time you get a ball in the basket, you score a point for"
83,00:07:09.04,00:07:09.04,your tribe. First tribe to score two points

85,00:07:13.21,00:07:13.21,playing for? >> Yes.
86,00:07:14.21,00:07:14.21,">> Hell, yeah. >> PROBST: The winning tribe"
87,00:07:15.83,00:07:15.83,"will leave here and be taken to a beautiful watering hole, and"
88,00:07:19.08,00:07:19.08,you will enjoy a feast... of... chocolate:
89,00:07:24.17,00:07:24.17,"chocolate bars, chocolate cake, >> I like cake."
90,00:07:27.54,00:07:27.54,">> PROBST: ...chocolate chip cookies, chocolate milk."
91,00:07:29.62,00:07:29.62,(Jerri laughs) >> That's the only thing I crave
92,00:07:31.71,00:07:31.71,out here. >> PROBST: To make it a little
93,00:07:33.83,00:07:33.83,"more enticing, I want to whet your appetite with just a little"
94,00:07:36.96,00:07:36.96,"taste of chocolate. >> Oh! Oh, my God!"
95,00:07:40.12,00:07:40.12,"That's kinda cool. Oh, wow."
96,00:07:44.17,00:07:44.17,">> I'm watching my weight. >> Oh, Amanda."

99,00:07:52.38,00:07:52.38,>> They don't want it? >> We'll take theirs.
100,00:07:54.96,00:07:54.96,">> PROBST: Colby, you have a look on your face like this is"
101,00:07:57.79,00:07:57.79,"annoying or somehow insulting. I handed you the plate, and you"
102,00:08:00.29,00:08:00.29,"were, like, ""I don't want this."" >> I'm not annoyed with you."
103,00:08:02.92,00:08:02.92,I'm ready to get to the challenge.
104,00:08:04.50,00:08:04.50,>> PROBST: Free offer of chocolate.

109,00:08:14.33,00:08:14.33,What kind of message are you sending to the Villains?
110,00:08:17.12,00:08:17.12,">> Hopefully, focus. We don't care about the reward."
111,00:08:20.83,00:08:20.83,We just want to win the the challenge.
112,00:08:23.12,00:08:23.12,">> We al, we're always focused when it comes to a challenge."
113,00:08:26.25,00:08:26.25,That's why we keep winning. (Rupert growls softly)
114,00:08:28.83,00:08:28.83,">> PROBST: All right, Villains, you are sitting out"
115,00:08:31.04,00:08:31.04,three people. It has to be three women.
116,00:08:33.04,00:08:33.04,"Sandra, Courtney and Parvati sitting out for the Villains."
117,00:08:37.08,00:08:37.08,"Heroes, you're sitting out one one person."
118,00:08:38.83,00:08:38.83,It has to be a man. >> I'll sit out.
119,00:08:41.17,00:08:41.17,I'll sit out. >> PROBST: Colby gonna sit this
120,00:08:43.04,00:08:43.04,"one out for the Heroes. Sit-outs, take a spot"

123,00:08:52.17,00:08:52.17,"All right, in the pit for the Villains, it's Danielle, Tyson"
124,00:08:56.25,00:08:56.25,"and Russell taking on Candice, James and Tom."
125,00:09:00.08,00:09:00.08,"Up on the platform it's Jerri, Coach and Rob for the Villains"

129,00:09:14.67,00:09:14.67,Gotta get the ball and get it back to your tribemates on
130,00:09:17.46,00:09:17.46,the platform. Heroes have all three balls
131,00:09:19.83,00:09:19.83,right off the bat. J.T. just misses.
132,00:09:25.12,00:09:25.12,"Rupert-- nice little floater. >> That a way, J.T., get close."
133,00:09:29.17,00:09:29.17,"Come on, focus. >> PROBST: Russell hanging"

136,00:09:35.92,00:09:35.92,hard hit. Big battle down below.
137,00:09:38.25,00:09:38.25,"Danielle comes up with it. >> You all right, James?"
138,00:09:44.21,00:09:44.21,">> Oh-oh, something's broke. >> PROBST: Hold up."

140,00:09:51.42,00:09:51.42,all right. >> PROBST: Hold up.
141,00:09:52.92,00:09:52.92,Give him a little space. Let the docs take a look.
142,00:09:57.04,00:09:57.04,>> Does that hurt if I do that? >> Yeah.
143,00:09:59.17,00:09:59.17,>> I'm gonna bend it. Can you bend it back?
144,00:10:01.46,00:10:01.46,>> It just buckled in. >> Is that all right?
145,00:10:03.62,00:10:03.62,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Claudia, what are you"
146,00:10:05.38,00:10:05.38,looking for right now? >> We're worried that he might
147,00:10:07.50,00:10:07.50,have pulled the lateral collateral ligament or the
148,00:10:10.12,00:10:10.12,"medial collateral ligament. In which case, it looks stable"
149,00:10:12.21,00:10:12.21,"at the moment, and he's not in pain."
150,00:10:14.21,00:10:14.21,He might have just sprained a muscle.
151,00:10:16.38,00:10:16.38,So now we'll get him up and see if he can walk on it.
152,00:10:23.08,00:10:23.08,"Speaking of that, move your hand up there."
153,00:10:26.25,00:10:26.25,>> I could walk it out? Is that what you're saying?
154,00:10:28.88,00:10:28.88,>> Let's see what you can do. >> This is weird.
155,00:10:32.04,00:10:32.04,"It don't hurt. All right, I'm good."
156,00:10:36.21,00:10:36.21,(James gasps) >> Maybe not.
157,00:10:37.29,00:10:37.29,>> You're not gonna be able to walk on it.
158,00:10:39.33,00:10:39.33,>> PROBST: Mmm... >> He's out.
159,00:10:40.58,00:10:40.58,It keeps kind of popping out inside there.
160,00:10:42.67,00:10:42.67,"Sit down and we'll see what we can do, but..."
161,00:10:45.00,00:10:45.00,>> PROBST: But for this challenge...?
162,00:10:46.17,00:10:46.17,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: Yeah, you're out."
163,00:10:48.00,00:10:48.00,">> Yeah, for this challenge, he's out."
164,00:10:49.42,00:10:49.42,">> PROBST: Okay, all right. >> Another tough challenge,"
165,00:10:52.54,00:10:52.54,"physical just like we wanted, but right off the bat, James"
166,00:10:55.92,00:10:55.92,got hurt. I'm not sure what he's done to
167,00:10:58.21,00:10:58.21,"his knee, but it doesn't look good."
168,00:11:00.17,00:11:00.17,"If James is pulled from this game, you know, a lot of my"
169,00:11:03.04,00:11:03.04,"strategy's changed. >> PROBST: All right, due to"
170,00:11:06.17,00:11:06.17,"James' injury, James is out of the challenge, which means the"
171,00:11:08.79,00:11:08.79,Heroes will be playing with five people instead of six.
172,00:11:11.33,00:11:11.33,"So whenever Candice and Tom are matched up, you will be one"
173,00:11:15.25,00:11:15.25,person short. I'm gonna start from the top.
174,00:11:19.04,00:11:19.04,Survivors ready? Go!
175,00:11:22.50,00:11:22.50,"Right off the bat, Tom gets two for the Heroes."
176,00:11:27.33,00:11:27.33,Coach just misses for the Villains.
177,00:11:30.67,00:11:30.67,J.T. with a nice toss. Just misses for the Heroes.
178,00:11:34.04,00:11:34.04,>> J.T.! >> Block it!
179,00:11:35.04,00:11:35.04,>> PROBST: And that scores for Amanda!
180,00:11:38.08,00:11:38.08,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Heroes score!
181,00:11:39.71,00:11:39.71,Switch it up. People in the pit are now
182,00:11:43.75,00:11:43.75,shooting. People shooting are now in
183,00:11:45.50,00:11:45.50,the pit. >> Nice work!
184,00:11:46.75,00:11:46.75,>> PROBST: We will rotate every round.
185,00:11:48.33,00:11:48.33,Heroes win the first point and lead 1-zip.

195,00:12:17.38,00:12:17.38,Rob and J.T. going at it. J.T. not giving up 
196,00:12:21.00,00:12:21.00,that ball. Russell gets pulled off

203,00:12:41.25,00:12:41.25,Villains have to score here to stay in this.
204,00:12:44.00,00:12:44.00,"Coach gets hit hard by J.T. Tyson tries to lock one in, and"
205,00:12:48.79,00:12:48.79,it works. Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop!
206,00:12:53.79,00:12:53.79,>> I did not mean to do that! You okay?
207,00:12:57.62,00:12:57.62,">> Yeah, I'm fine. He socked me."
208,00:13:01.04,00:13:01.04,">> Oh, like I meant to do that. >> Whatever, dude, whatever."
209,00:13:03.46,00:13:03.46,>> Fine. >> Not bleeding.
210,00:13:06.12,00:13:06.12,>> PROBST: Here we go. We're tied 1-1.

213,00:13:15.17,00:13:15.17,Survivors ready? Go!
214,00:13:20.54,00:13:20.54,Big scramble for the ball. Russell comes up with two
215,00:13:23.71,00:13:23.71,for the Villains. Tom comes up with one for
216,00:13:27.04,00:13:27.04,the Heroes. Boston Rob tosses one
217,00:13:29.46,00:13:29.46,and just misses. Rupert can't hold onto it.
218,00:13:32.50,00:13:32.50,Danielle gets it to Tyson. Tom battling for that ball.
219,00:13:36.38,00:13:36.38,Clears the way for Candice to get it.
220,00:13:38.71,00:13:38.71,"Boston Rob floats one, but J.T. blocks it."
221,00:13:41.38,00:13:41.38,>> Oh! That was gonna go in! >> PROBST: Boston Rob
222,00:13:44.04,00:13:44.04,blocks J.T. J.T. now has a shot for
223,00:13:50.04,00:13:50.04,the Heroes. In and out!
224,00:13:52.12,00:13:52.12,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Jerri scores for
225,00:13:56.71,00:13:56.71,the Villains! Villains win reward!
226,00:13:59.25,00:13:59.25,(Villains cheering) >> We get chocolate!
227,00:14:11.79,00:14:11.79,">> PROBST: All right, good hard-fought battle once again"
228,00:14:14.29,00:14:14.29,in Heroes vs. Villains. Villains come up victorious.
229,00:14:17.29,00:14:17.29,"You're leaving from here. Grab your stuff, head out,"
230,00:14:20.33,00:14:20.33,enjoy the afternoon. >> Yes!
231,00:14:22.04,00:14:22.04,">> Chocolate, baby! Oh, yeah! >> PROBST: All right, Heroes,"
232,00:14:24.83,00:14:24.83,"I got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head"
233,00:14:27.08,00:14:27.08,"back to camp. Except you, James."
234,00:14:29.08,00:14:29.08,Stick around. We're gonna have Medical look
235,00:14:30.71,00:14:30.71,at that. >> I hope for our sake that
236,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,James come back to camp because we really need him.
237,00:14:36.62,00:14:36.62,To lose one of our best competitors would be
238,00:14:39.25,00:14:39.25,heartbreaking. It'd be a tragedy.
239,00:14:47.42,00:14:47.42,>> Him not being able to walk makes me worried straight away
240,00:14:51.38,00:14:51.38,that he stretched it quite significantly.
241,00:14:54.08,00:14:54.08,"Basically, we want to keep him in the game, but I'm afraid"
242,00:14:57.17,00:14:57.17,that he's done severe enough damage to take him out.
243,00:14:59.96,00:14:59.96,">> PROBST: All right, you're gonna splint him up, and then"
244,00:15:02.33,00:15:02.33,see if he can walk on it. That's the test.
245,00:15:04.67,00:15:04.67,>> That's correct. That's correct.
246,00:15:10.17,00:15:10.17,"(all clamoring) >> Oh, my God.)"
247,00:15:13.46,00:15:13.46,>> I know. Where to start? (Jerri shrieks)
248,00:15:17.54,00:15:17.54,">> Congratulations, guys. We all got it, everybody."
249,00:15:20.92,00:15:20.92,>> Good job. >> I need a plate.
250,00:15:22.92,00:15:22.92,>> So proud of you guys. >> It's nice winning rewards.
251,00:15:26.92,00:15:26.92,We got two good things happening at one time: we got rid of the
252,00:15:30.17,00:15:30.17,"big boy James, maybe, and we got to eat chocolates."
253,00:15:34.83,00:15:34.83,">> Oh, my God, I knew this was gonna happen."
254,00:15:37.46,00:15:37.46,>> What? >> Chocolate headache.
255,00:15:40.25,00:15:40.25,>> I have never eaten so much chocolate in one sitting in my
256,00:15:43.25,00:15:43.25,"entire life. Okay, I must agree,"
257,00:15:45.38,00:15:45.38,"this is obscene. I'm, like, in a mix of"
258,00:15:48.83,00:15:48.83,chocolate euphoria and sickness. (chuckles ruefully)
259,00:16:02.25,00:16:02.25,>> Whoo! (woman laughs)
260,00:16:06.46,00:16:06.46,">> Cool, huh? >> Yeah."
261,00:16:07.46,00:16:07.46,">> Lookit, we're, like, under the ground right now."
262,00:16:09.50,00:16:09.50,"(Jerri laughs) So in the middle of the grounds,"
263,00:16:13.17,00:16:13.17,"there's this huge hole in the earth, and it's about 40 feet"
264,00:16:17.17,00:16:17.17,"from the top to the bottom of this cave, and it's full of"
265,00:16:21.04,00:16:21.04,cold saltwater that comes in right off the ocean.
266,00:16:24.46,00:16:24.46,"I mean, it's like something I'd never seen before."
267,00:16:27.04,00:16:27.04,>> Who's left up there with Parvati?
268,00:16:31.71,00:16:31.71,">> We're gonna look real dumb if, like, he's out here playing"
269,00:16:34.21,00:16:34.21,us all. >> He got it right away.
270,00:16:40.33,00:16:40.33,">> I guarantee it. >> When I played Survivor,"
271,00:16:42.71,00:16:42.71,there were no hidden immunity idols then.
272,00:16:45.08,00:16:45.08,So this is all new to me. I'm just trying to adjust as
273,00:16:48.00,00:16:48.00,"I go along. But at the end of the day, we"
274,00:16:50.42,00:16:50.42,have to flush it out. The only way to do that is
275,00:16:53.42,00:16:53.42,"to vote for him. >> Look, things are changing..."
276,00:16:58.38,00:16:58.38,>> What? (laughs)
277,00:17:03.12,00:17:03.12,Cheers. (laughs) Russell having the idol puts me
278,00:17:09.62,00:17:09.62,in a better position in the game.
279,00:17:11.38,00:17:11.38,Give me a little stronger footing because right now
280,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,everyone's still trying to vote me out.
281,00:17:16.25,00:17:16.25,The all think I'm the biggest threat.
282,00:17:18.38,00:17:18.38,"For some reason, I'm like some evil mastermind who is gonna"
283,00:17:22.17,00:17:22.17,"screw all of them over, so they all want to vote me out now."
284,00:17:26.21,00:17:26.21,So Russell having the idol is definitely like a good.
285,00:17:30.17,00:17:30.17,"He's a great ally for me. >> Just grab onto my coattails,"
286,00:17:33.38,00:17:33.38,"girl. Yes, you do."
287,00:17:35.50,00:17:35.50,>> I don't. >> You'll ride these.
288,00:17:37.04,00:17:37.04,"You gonna be okay. Nobody can know this, but"
289,00:17:39.33,00:17:39.33,somebody has to know with me so we can work it.
290,00:17:42.71,00:17:42.71,I'm gonna show Coach. I'm gonna say...
291,00:17:46.21,00:17:46.21,>> He's scared. >> Yeah.
292,00:17:48.08,00:17:48.08,"Hit him blindside, and get rid of Rob."
293,00:17:50.67,00:17:50.67,>> Yay! (laughs) >> I'm gonna have to convince
294,00:17:53.71,00:17:53.71,Coach to come to my side so we can get numbers here.
295,00:17:57.08,00:17:57.08,I have a powerful tool and that is the hidden immunity idol.
296,00:18:02.92,00:18:02.92,I have the idol. And now we have the idol.
297,00:18:06.50,00:18:06.50,"So we get to the merge, we have to be to get to the merge."
298,00:18:13.79,00:18:13.79,We can blindside whoever we want at anytime we want.
299,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,"And let me tell you something. on my life, that's the way"
300,00:18:21.92,00:18:21.92,I play to keep my numbers to get further in the game.
301,00:18:25.17,00:18:25.17,I don't have any problem to give it to you to get further in the
302,00:18:28.42,00:18:28.42,"game with the votes. >> Wow! I mean, this is crazy."
303,00:18:31.58,00:18:31.58,">> Dude, it took me three three days..."
304,00:18:33.04,00:18:33.04,>> Whew! >> ...and digging and digging
305,00:18:35.29,00:18:35.29,and digging >> I do want to play the game
306,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17,"with Boston Rob, but for Russell to trust me with that, is"
307,00:18:41.88,00:18:41.88,huge on his part because I'm the kind of person that if you
308,00:18:45.21,00:18:45.21,"give me your loyalty, it's almost impossible for me to"
309,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,betray that trust. I feel like I need to do
310,00:18:50.75,00:18:50.75,something monumental like Knights of the Roundtable.
311,00:18:53.12,00:18:53.12,"We go like this, and we put... >> Can I do this?"
312,00:18:55.79,00:18:55.79,">> No, you do, you would, like, knight me just like that."
313,00:18:59.38,00:18:59.38,I feel like this is... (Russell laughs)
314,00:19:01.29,00:19:01.29,"No, I'm serious. I feel like this is a"
315,00:19:03.50,00:19:03.50,"monumental moment... >> Dude, it is..."
316,00:19:04.92,00:19:04.92,>> ...and I honor you for trusting me.
317,00:19:06.79,00:19:06.79,>> I would never come to you and told you if I didn't trust you.
318,00:19:10.46,00:19:10.46,"Coach bows down to me. He was the one kneeling to me,"
319,00:19:14.67,00:19:14.67,and I knight him as the king that I am.
320,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,I knight the dragon slayer to be part of my kingdom.
321,00:19:22.21,00:19:22.21,The king and the dragon slayer. (both laugh)
322,00:19:25.21,00:19:25.21,">> Wow, man, that just blows my mind, dude."
323,00:19:28.42,00:19:28.42,>> I have the dragon slayer on my side now.
324,00:19:30.62,00:19:30.62,Then we'll weed out little Rob's group.
325,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,It's personal with me and Rob. I don't think he knows who he's
326,00:19:36.08,00:19:36.08,dealing with. He thinks he's tough?
327,00:19:37.83,00:19:37.83,"All right, may the best man win. Let's do this."
328,00:19:49.17,00:19:49.17,">> I'm just so frustrated, Candice, I really am."
329,00:19:51.04,00:19:51.04,">> I'm very frustrated myself. >> I can't believe we, I can't"
330,00:19:55.04,00:19:55.04,believe what happened today. I really can't.
331,00:19:56.67,00:19:56.67,"If he gets taken out, this will be the second time he's been"
332,00:20:00.00,00:20:00.00,taken out for an injury. >> I know.
333,00:20:02.00,00:20:02.00,">> It's so sad. Uh! I'm just so frustrated,"
334,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,you know? It's a reward challenge for
335,00:20:08.08,00:20:08.08,"chocolate, and James gets hurt hurt again."
336,00:20:13.58,00:20:13.58,And he could have a serious injury.
337,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,"Like, his knee, did you see it? It was like..."
338,00:20:18.04,00:20:18.04,">> It's just a ligament, I think."
339,00:20:19.42,00:20:19.42,>> Really? >> Yeah.
340,00:20:20.42,00:20:20.42,James wants to be here so bad. And he looks out for me.
341,00:20:24.75,00:20:24.75,(voice breaking): I'm like his little sister.
342,00:20:26.46,00:20:26.46,"And so it's like, I don't know. It's just hard."
343,00:20:29.12,00:20:29.12,"I was trying to, like, make myself think, ""Okay, if James"
344,00:20:33.25,00:20:33.25,"doesn't come back, what am I gonna do?"""
345,00:20:35.96,00:20:35.96,And I can't even think about it right now.
346,00:20:38.46,00:20:38.46,I just hope that tonight I see him walk down that beach.
347,00:20:41.62,00:20:41.62,I really do. >> I don't think James is coming
348,00:20:46.04,00:20:46.04,"coming back. >> Yes, James has been gone"
349,00:20:48.00,00:20:48.00,"way too long. If he was coming back, they"
350,00:20:50.25,00:20:50.25,"would have braced his knee, and they would have sent him home."
351,00:20:53.12,00:20:53.12,">> James and I have our differences, and, uh, I'm not"
352,00:20:57.46,00:20:57.46,"rooting against a teammate, but in the game of Survivor,"
353,00:21:02.54,00:21:02.54,"somebody else being hobbled, in some ways, is your advantage."
354,00:21:06.83,00:21:06.83,">> I mean, that's it. Something that could affect him"
355,00:21:09.96,00:21:09.96,the rest of his life. >> Heartbreaking.
356,00:21:16.04,00:21:16.04,>> It's James. >> James is coming back?
357,00:21:19.33,00:21:19.33,">> Oh, my God! >> And he's walking!"
358,00:21:30.62,00:21:30.62,>> I can't help it! I'm sorry!
359,00:21:40.88,00:21:40.88,"You okay? >> Yeah, I'm all right."
360,00:21:42.71,00:21:42.71,">> James is back, and I was so happy."
361,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,(sobs) >> Yay! (laughs)
362,00:21:48.54,00:21:48.54,"Oh,yay! >> Welcome back, big man."
363,00:21:51.04,00:21:51.04,">> Yay. >> Ah, yay!"
364,00:21:53.92,00:21:53.92,">> So, yeah, what's the verdict? >> They don't know what's wrong"
365,00:21:55.67,00:21:55.67,with it. I don't know.
366,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,">> Really? >> What do you mean, they don't"
367,00:21:58.29,00:21:58.29,know what's wrong with it? >> 'Cause they don't know
368,00:22:00.12,00:22:00.12,what's wrong with it. It's just not working.
369,00:22:02.17,00:22:02.17,It felt good coming back in the camp.
370,00:22:04.29,00:22:04.29,"I mean, we'll see how things go."
371,00:22:06.17,00:22:06.17,"Hopefully, my alliance will stick together and keep me"
372,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,around till my knee heals up. I have to work with what I got
373,00:22:11.17,00:22:11.17,and make it happen. Make some lemonade out of this

563,00:30:19.08,00:30:19.08,to be better than Tom. He really hasn't done anything
564,00:30:22.12,00:30:22.12,in challenges but cause confusion at the puzzle area.
565,00:30:25.04,00:30:25.04,"I mean, what's his excuses? He has good knees."
566,00:30:28.21,00:30:28.21,"He's still messed up. >> All right, so it's been"
567,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,established that they can beat us in puzzles.
568,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,I think that's fairly well established.
569,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,>> We just can't pull it together on the puzzles.
570,00:30:50.17,00:30:50.17,">> Or baskets, shooting. >> Or pretty much anything"
571,00:30:55.50,00:30:55.50,except sumo wrestling. >> Pretty much.
572,00:30:58.42,00:30:58.42,>> God! >> Now the conniving starts.
573,00:31:02.25,00:31:02.25,>> Yep. >> What do you think?
574,00:31:06.96,00:31:06.96,>> James. >> Is that consensus or do you
575,00:31:11.71,00:31:11.71,think that? >> I think J.T. will go along
576,00:31:15.12,00:31:15.12,"with it, too. >> We're not changing,"
577,00:31:21.71,00:31:21.71,are we? Tom? Good.
578,00:31:24.79,00:31:24.79,">> Tom. Done. >> No matter, no matter what's"
579,00:31:27.96,00:31:27.96,wrong with James' leg. >> James' leg; he's still
580,00:31:30.08,00:31:30.08,"stronger than Tom. >> All right, good."
581,00:31:32.38,00:31:32.38,>> Tom. >> Why? I feel like this is
582,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,the dumbest move. He can't run!
583,00:31:39.08,00:31:39.08,"I mean, are we being stupid? >> I can't run."
584,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,"If that's the criteria, then you should have put me out."
585,00:31:47.08,00:31:47.08,>> I feel like this is like a really risky move.
586,00:31:55.04,00:31:55.04,>> Maybe. Let's just think about it hard.
587,00:32:02.67,00:32:02.67,Decide together. >> Yeah.
588,00:32:05.50,00:32:05.50,>> We got the afternoon to think about it.
589,00:32:07.62,00:32:07.62,We need to think about it. >> Yeah.
590,00:32:09.96,00:32:09.96,">> Yeah. >> How you feeling, man?"
591,00:32:12.96,00:32:12.96,">> Dude, I'm good. >> I know you are."
592,00:32:15.08,00:32:15.08,>> This is a big-ass distraction.
593,00:32:16.75,00:32:16.75,"Like someone that, you know... >> You sure?"
594,00:32:19.75,00:32:19.75,">> Yeah, I just don't want to go."
595,00:32:21.67,00:32:21.67,>> I know you're good. >> Cool deal.
596,00:32:23.38,00:32:23.38,"Y'all figure it out, but I really don't want to go."
597,00:32:29.21,00:32:29.21,">> Logically, I should vote out James tonight."
598,00:32:34.33,00:32:34.33,"But if I were to try anything snakey again, I'm around Rupert,"
599,00:32:38.21,00:32:38.21,"James and Amanda. That would put myself in a,"
600,00:32:40.62,00:32:40.62,in a bad spot. >> Candice is pushing hard
601,00:32:43.88,00:32:43.88,for James. If we're going totally on
602,00:32:46.42,00:32:46.42,"strength, Candice's butt is the weakest."
603,00:32:48.54,00:32:48.54,We vote Candice's butt out. >> Yep.
604,00:32:52.71,00:32:52.71,">> I still, I still say Tom, but I would, I would vote for"
605,00:32:56.38,00:32:56.38,"Candice now, too. >> I say Tom first,"
606,00:32:59.67,00:32:59.67,then Candice. We're not getting rid of James.
607,00:33:01.96,00:33:01.96,"James is okay, right? >> No. I don't know."
608,00:33:07.21,00:33:07.21,">> It's just more logical to do, to vote James out."
609,00:33:11.42,00:33:11.42,">> That's the way the cookie crumbles, you know what I mean?"
610,00:33:14.21,00:33:14.21,James is the one that's injured.
611,00:33:15.88,00:33:15.88,">> I know. We're in control right now,"
612,00:33:17.96,00:33:17.96,you and I because we can go either way.
613,00:33:20.25,00:33:20.25,"Tilt the thing either way. >> God, I hope J.T. votes good."
614,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,>> J.T. cannot cross us. >> This is so stupid because
615,00:33:30.62,00:33:30.62,"J.T. didn't vote with us last Tribal Council, but I'm really"
616,00:33:34.00,00:33:34.00,depending on his vote tonight. 'Cause if he doesn't vote with
617,00:33:38.04,00:33:38.04,"us, that means he's voting with Tom, Colby and Candice"
618,00:33:41.62,00:33:41.62,against James. >> It makes perfect sense to get
619,00:33:43.83,00:33:43.83,"rid of James. I mean, there's no logic"
620,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,in voting to keep James and getting rid of you.
621,00:33:49.33,00:33:49.33,You don't even have to plead your story.
622,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,>> Mm-mm. >> I'm happy to hear that
623,00:33:53.42,00:33:53.42,"from both of you. >> In order for us to win,"
624,00:33:56.21,00:33:56.21,that's the best move for us to make.
625,00:33:58.33,00:33:58.33,>> Yeah. I've got another noose around
626,00:34:00.29,00:34:00.29,"my neck, and, uh, until the votes come up and you read"
627,00:34:03.79,00:34:03.79,"your name four times, you're still alive in this game."
628,00:34:08.50,00:34:08.50,I need J.T. and Candice to see the logic in sticking with Colby
629,00:34:11.92,00:34:11.92,and I and eliminating James tonight.
630,00:34:16.25,00:34:16.25,I'm pretty sure Candice is with us.
631,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,And I'm hoping that J.T. sees the light.
632,00:34:21.62,00:34:21.62,>> J.T.... >> I was thinking your way.
633,00:34:28.04,00:34:28.04,>> I would hope so. >> I'm voting the same as you do
634,00:34:30.25,00:34:30.25,"then. >> Which do we want,"
635,00:34:32.25,00:34:32.25,Tom or Candice? Okay?
636,00:34:38.29,00:34:38.29,>> All right >> You and me.
637,00:34:39.79,00:34:39.79,>> I'm with you. >> Okay.
638,00:34:44.08,00:34:44.08,">> Um, J.T.'s the one. He's the swing."
639,00:34:47.71,00:34:47.71,"I'm sure he's with us. >> Where's J., where's J.T. on"
640,00:34:50.38,00:34:50.38,all this? >> J.T. says that he's with us.
641,00:34:52.12,00:34:52.12,>> Yep. >> J.T. looked me in the eye
642,00:34:54.58,00:34:54.58,and swore he's writing Tom's name down.
643,00:34:57.50,00:34:57.50,>> What's the word? >> I guess we get rid of James.
644,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,It should be James. >> I think tonight James should
645,00:35:06.08,00:35:06.08,be the one. >> Makes all the logical sense
646,00:35:08.42,00:35:08.42,to get rid of James. >> We're going to another Tribal
647,00:35:12.62,00:35:12.62,Council and most everybody's looking to J.T. for a vote.
648,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,And the reason for that is because J. T. is so wishy-washy.
649,00:35:19.96,00:35:19.96,"J.T. flip-flops at every opportunity that he has, you"
650,00:35:23.25,00:35:23.25,"know, because he's clearly just playing the hand that suits"
651,00:35:26.33,00:35:26.33,him today. >> I swear.
652,00:35:29.21,00:35:29.21,">> I don't know what he's telling everybody else, but if"
653,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,"he's making deals with everyone in this posse, I can guarantee"
654,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,that will come back to bite him. >> PROBST: Let's start by going
655,00:36:06.33,00:36:06.33,"back to the reward challenge. James, what happened?"
656,00:36:09.00,00:36:09.00,>> I don't know really what happened.
657,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,"I popped it, and I thought I was okay, and I tried to stand up."
658,00:36:13.71,00:36:13.71,"And it doesn't hurt. It just, right now it's"
659,00:36:16.25,00:36:16.25,"not listening. >> PROBST: Rupert, this is an"
660,00:36:18.25,00:36:18.25,unusual situation; to have somebody that's still in the
661,00:36:21.00,00:36:21.00,"game, but they're immobilized. My niece could beat James"
662,00:36:24.33,00:36:24.33,"in a race right now. >> No, she couldn't."
663,00:36:26.42,00:36:26.42,>> PROBST: I watched you walking today.
664,00:36:28.17,00:36:28.17,">> With this brace, yes, it's a little bit harder."
665,00:36:30.71,00:36:30.71,"But you couldn't beat me in a race, man."
666,00:36:33.04,00:36:33.04,(Probst chuckles) Real talk.
667,00:36:34.21,00:36:34.21,">> James still has some strength in there, you know."
668,00:36:38.00,00:36:38.00,I want to believe that James is gonna be okay.
669,00:36:40.83,00:36:40.83,">> PROBST: J.T., you can certainly understand why if"
670,00:36:43.71,00:36:43.71,"you're James, you want to put your best foot forward and say,"
671,00:36:46.33,00:36:46.33,"""Don't get rid of me 'cause of this."""
672,00:36:48.25,00:36:48.25,">> Yeah, man, I understand exactly what he's saying."
673,00:36:50.17,00:36:50.17,I mean there's no way I would ever say vote me out due
674,00:36:53.21,00:36:53.21,to an injury. I don't care if I had a cast
675,00:36:55.67,00:36:55.67,and my leg was broke. >> PROBST: What's the level of
676,00:36:58.08,00:36:58.08,"concern, though his spirit may be there, physically may not be"
677,00:37:01.54,00:37:01.54,able to perform like he needs to be able to?
678,00:37:04.54,00:37:04.54,">> That's a huge concern. I mean, a very high level"
679,00:37:07.08,00:37:07.08,"of concern. I mean, we gotta win."
680,00:37:09.17,00:37:09.17,Our back's against the wall. We cannot lose anymore.
681,00:37:12.00,00:37:12.00,">> PROBST: James, what do you think happened today?"
682,00:37:14.17,00:37:14.17,You got 'em there ahead of the other group.
683,00:37:16.46,00:37:16.46,What happened during the puzzle? We started off all right in the
684,00:37:19.17,00:37:19.17,"beginning, and after that, everybody just went haywire and"
685,00:37:21.50,00:37:21.50,"did their own thing. Over here it just, everybody"
686,00:37:24.42,00:37:24.42,went willy-nilly and tried to solve the puzzle on each side.
687,00:37:27.58,00:37:27.58,>> PROBST: You keep looking this way.
688,00:37:29.92,00:37:29.92,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Who you looking at?
689,00:37:31.88,00:37:31.88,>> Them two. >> PROBST: Tom and?
690,00:37:35.04,00:37:35.04,">> Candice. >> No, he's mad because we're"
691,00:37:37.92,00:37:37.92,thinking about whether it makes sense to keep him
692,00:37:41.92,00:37:41.92,"with the bum knee or not, and that's what he's"
693,00:37:44.21,00:37:44.21,"talking about. >> Baby, you just hustling"
694,00:37:45.83,00:37:45.83,for your next thing. I'm tired of arguing with y'all.
695,00:37:48.12,00:37:48.12,I'm honestly over both of y'all.
696,00:37:49.62,00:37:49.62,"It's whatever. >> Jeff, all this pretense"
697,00:37:51.75,00:37:51.75,"about whether or not it's his physical condition, and Rupert"
698,00:37:54.83,00:37:54.83,"saying, ""Well, we think that he's gonna be okay,"""
699,00:37:57.96,00:37:57.96,it's all nonsense. He's not being kept
700,00:37:59.42,00:37:59.42,for any physical ability. He's being kept because
701,00:38:01.38,00:38:01.38,"he's a loyal vote. >> Well, it looks like Tom's"
702,00:38:03.42,00:38:03.42,"pointing the blame, but also... >> That's the, that's the,"
703,00:38:05.58,00:38:05.58,that's the main thing. There's blame on us.
704,00:38:07.38,00:38:07.38,>> ...he tried to vote me out. And I don't think I'm a weak
705,00:38:10.04,00:38:10.04,"player in this game, so it's vice versa."

707,00:38:14.62,00:38:14.62,the people who won't shut up and just do.
708,00:38:17.00,00:38:17.00,>> I don't see that. Not during the challenges.
709,00:38:19.25,00:38:19.25,I don't think it plays out that way.
710,00:38:21.21,00:38:21.21,"Um, when he talks about shutting up and doing what"
711,00:38:23.42,00:38:23.42,"you're told, that's his voting strategy."
712,00:38:25.58,00:38:25.58,"Somebody tells him, ""Shut up. ""Just vote the way I'm"
713,00:38:28.83,00:38:28.83,"telling you."" It's not his game strategy."
714,00:38:30.38,00:38:30.38,"If he's quiet during the challenge, it's probably because"
715,00:38:32.75,00:38:32.75,"he doesn't know what's going on. >> PROBST: J.T., is that"
716,00:38:35.58,00:38:35.58,"a fair comment? James saying, ""Tom just needs"
717,00:38:38.25,00:38:38.25,"""to shut up. It's causing us to lose."""
718,00:38:40.12,00:38:40.12,">> I wouldn't say that it's causing us to lose, no."
719,00:38:42.83,00:38:42.83,I don't think it's right to point the blame at nobody for us
720,00:38:46.00,00:38:46.00,"losing 'cause none of can win. >> PROBST: Tom, last Tribal"
721,00:38:49.08,00:38:49.08,Council you played the hidden immunity idol.
722,00:38:51.25,00:38:51.25,"Clearly you felt you were in trouble, and you were."
723,00:38:53.67,00:38:53.67,You got votes. Concerned again that it's you?

725,00:38:59.17,00:38:59.17,couple of good people vote for the team and for our strength
726,00:39:04.04,00:39:04.04,"and for our unity, and not for the numbers."
727,00:39:06.42,00:39:06.42,You know if somebody here thinks that James with a busted knee is
728,00:39:09.58,00:39:09.58,"gonna do more in the competitions than I am, I don't"
729,00:39:12.79,00:39:12.79,think they're being sincere. I think they're just voting
730,00:39:15.12,00:39:15.12,and keeping their numbers together.

734,00:39:24.25,00:39:24.25,"could win with him, ball, go ahead."
735,00:39:26.67,00:39:26.67,"But we still gonna be cool. >> PROBST: Well, James laid it"
736,00:39:32.21,00:39:32.21,out pretty clearly. It is time to vote.

743,00:40:55.17,00:40:55.17,James. James.
744,00:41:00.83,00:41:00.83,"That's two votes Tom, two votes James."
