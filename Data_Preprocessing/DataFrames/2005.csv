258,00:16:02.25,00:16:02.25,>> Whoo!(woman laughs)

263,00:16:17.17,00:16:17.17,"from the top to the bottom ofthis cave, and it's full of"
264,00:16:21.04,00:16:21.04,cold saltwater that comes inright off the ocean.
265,00:16:24.46,00:16:24.46,"I mean, it's like something I'dnever seen before."
266,00:16:27.04,00:16:27.04,>> Who's left up there withParvati?

270,00:16:42.71,00:16:42.71,there were no hidden immunityidols then.
271,00:16:45.08,00:16:45.08,So this is all new to me.I'm just trying to adjust as
272,00:16:48.00,00:16:48.00,"I go along.But at the end of the day, we"
273,00:16:50.42,00:16:50.42,have to flush it out.The only way to do that is
274,00:16:53.42,00:16:53.42,"to vote for him.>> Look, things are changing..."
275,00:16:58.38,00:16:58.38,>> What?(laughs)
276,00:17:03.12,00:17:03.12,Cheers. (laughs)Russell having the idol puts me
277,00:17:09.62,00:17:09.62,in a better positionin the game.
278,00:17:11.38,00:17:11.38,Give me a little strongerfooting because right now
279,00:17:14.33,00:17:14.33,everyone's still trying to voteme out.
280,00:17:16.25,00:17:16.25,The all think I'm the biggestthreat.
281,00:17:18.38,00:17:18.38,"For some reason, I'm like someevil mastermind who is gonna"
282,00:17:22.17,00:17:22.17,"screw all of them over, so theyall want to vote me out now."
283,00:17:26.21,00:17:26.21,So Russell having the idol isdefinitely like a good.
284,00:17:30.17,00:17:30.17,"He's a great ally for me.>> Just grab onto my coattails,"
285,00:17:33.38,00:17:33.38,"girl.Yes, you do."

293,00:17:53.71,00:17:53.71,Coach to come to my side so wecan get numbers here.
294,00:17:57.08,00:17:57.08,I have a powerful tool and thatis the hidden immunity idol.
295,00:18:02.92,00:18:02.92,I have the idol.And now we have the idol.
296,00:18:06.50,00:18:06.50,"So we get to the merge, we haveto be to get to the merge."

301,00:18:28.42,00:18:28.42,"game with the votes.>> Wow! I mean, this is crazy."
302,00:18:31.58,00:18:31.58,">> Dude, it took me threethree days..."
303,00:18:33.04,00:18:33.04,>> Whew!>> ...and digging and digging
304,00:18:35.29,00:18:35.29,and digging>> I do want to play the game
305,00:18:39.17,00:18:39.17,"with Boston Rob, but for Russellto trust me with that, is"
306,00:18:41.88,00:18:41.88,huge on his part because I'mthe kind of person that if you
307,00:18:45.21,00:18:45.21,"give me your loyalty, it'salmost impossible for me to"
308,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,betray that trust.I feel like I need to do
309,00:18:50.75,00:18:50.75,something monumental likeKnights of the Roundtable.
310,00:18:53.12,00:18:53.12,"We go like this, and we put...>> Can I do this?"
311,00:18:55.79,00:18:55.79,">> No, you do, you would, like,knight me just like that."
312,00:18:59.38,00:18:59.38,I feel like this is...(Russell laughs)
313,00:19:01.29,00:19:01.29,"No, I'm serious.I feel like this is a"
314,00:19:03.50,00:19:03.50,"monumental moment...>> Dude, it is..."
315,00:19:04.92,00:19:04.92,>> ...and I honor you fortrusting me.
316,00:19:06.79,00:19:06.79,>> I would never come to you andtold you if I didn't trust you.
317,00:19:10.46,00:19:10.46,"Coach bows down to me.He was the one kneeling to me,"
318,00:19:14.67,00:19:14.67,and I knight him as the kingthat I am.
319,00:19:18.21,00:19:18.21,I knight the dragon slayer to bepart of my kingdom.
320,00:19:22.21,00:19:22.21,The king and the dragon slayer.(both laugh)
321,00:19:25.21,00:19:25.21,">> Wow, man, that just blowsmy mind, dude."
322,00:19:28.42,00:19:28.42,>> I have the dragon slayer onmy side now.
323,00:19:30.62,00:19:30.62,Then we'll weed out littleRob's group.
324,00:19:33.21,00:19:33.21,It's personal with me and Rob.I don't think he knows who he's
325,00:19:36.08,00:19:36.08,dealing with.He thinks he's tough?
326,00:19:37.83,00:19:37.83,"All right, may the best man win.Let's do this."
327,00:19:49.17,00:19:49.17,">> I'm just so frustrated,Candice, I really am."
328,00:19:51.04,00:19:51.04,">> I'm very frustrated myself.>> I can't believe we, I can't"
329,00:19:55.04,00:19:55.04,believe what happened today.I really can't.
330,00:19:56.67,00:19:56.67,"If he gets taken out, this willbe the second time he's been"
331,00:20:00.00,00:20:00.00,taken out for an injury.>> I know.
332,00:20:02.00,00:20:02.00,">> It's so sad.Uh! I'm just so frustrated,"
333,00:20:04.08,00:20:04.08,you know?It's a reward challenge for
334,00:20:08.08,00:20:08.08,"chocolate, and James gets hurthurt again."
335,00:20:13.58,00:20:13.58,And he could have a seriousinjury.
336,00:20:15.42,00:20:15.42,"Like, his knee, did you see it?It was like..."
337,00:20:18.04,00:20:18.04,">> It's just a ligament,I think."
338,00:20:19.42,00:20:19.42,>> Really?>> Yeah.
339,00:20:20.42,00:20:20.42,James wants to be here so bad.And he looks out for me.
340,00:20:24.75,00:20:24.75,(voice breaking): I'm like hislittle sister.
341,00:20:26.46,00:20:26.46,"And so it's like, I don't know.It's just hard."
342,00:20:29.12,00:20:29.12,"I was trying to, like, makemyself think, ""Okay, if James"
343,00:20:33.25,00:20:33.25,"doesn't come back, what am Igonna do?"""
344,00:20:35.96,00:20:35.96,And I can't even thinkabout it right now.
345,00:20:38.46,00:20:38.46,I just hope that tonight I seehim walk down that beach.
346,00:20:41.62,00:20:41.62,I really do.>> I don't think James is coming
347,00:20:46.04,00:20:46.04,"coming back.>> Yes, James has been gone"
348,00:20:48.00,00:20:48.00,"way too long.If he was coming back, they"
349,00:20:50.25,00:20:50.25,"would have braced his knee, andthey would have sent him home."
350,00:20:53.12,00:20:53.12,">> James and I have ourdifferences, and, uh, I'm not"
351,00:20:57.46,00:20:57.46,"rooting against a teammate, butin the game of Survivor,"
352,00:21:02.54,00:21:02.54,"somebody else being hobbled, insome ways, is your advantage."
353,00:21:06.83,00:21:06.83,">> I mean, that's it.Something that could affect him"
354,00:21:09.96,00:21:09.96,the rest of his life.>> Heartbreaking.
355,00:21:16.04,00:21:16.04,>> It's James.>> James is coming back?
356,00:21:19.33,00:21:19.33,">> Oh, my God!>> And he's walking!"
357,00:21:30.62,00:21:30.62,>> I can't help it!I'm sorry!
358,00:21:40.88,00:21:40.88,"You okay?>> Yeah, I'm all right."
359,00:21:42.71,00:21:42.71,">> James is back, and I wasso happy."
360,00:21:45.12,00:21:45.12,(sobs)>> Yay! (laughs)

363,00:21:53.92,00:21:53.92,">> So, yeah, what's the verdict?>> They don't know what's wrong"
364,00:21:55.67,00:21:55.67,with it.I don't know.
365,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,">> Really?>> What do you mean, they don't"
366,00:21:58.29,00:21:58.29,know what's wrong with it?>> 'Cause they don't know
367,00:22:00.12,00:22:00.12,what's wrong with it.It's just not working.
368,00:22:02.17,00:22:02.17,It felt good coming backin the camp.
369,00:22:04.29,00:22:04.29,"I mean, we'll see howthings go."
370,00:22:06.17,00:22:06.17,"Hopefully, my alliance willstick together and keep me"
371,00:22:08.08,00:22:08.08,around till my knee heals up.I have to work with what I got
372,00:22:11.17,00:22:11.17,and make it happen.Make some lemonade out of this
373,00:22:13.71,00:22:13.71,lemon knee.It's crazy 'cause it don't hurt.

563,00:30:22.12,00:30:22.12,in challenges but causeconfusion at the puzzle area.
564,00:30:25.04,00:30:25.04,"I mean, what's his excuses?He has good knees."
565,00:30:28.21,00:30:28.21,"He's still messed up.>> All right, so it's been"
566,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,established that they can beatus in puzzles.
567,00:30:44.25,00:30:44.25,I think that's fairly wellestablished.
568,00:30:47.17,00:30:47.17,>> We just can't pull ittogether on the puzzles.

573,00:31:06.96,00:31:06.96,>> James.>> Is that consensus or do you
574,00:31:11.71,00:31:11.71,think that?>> I think J.T. will go along
575,00:31:15.12,00:31:15.12,"with it, too.>> We're not changing,"
576,00:31:21.71,00:31:21.71,are we? Tom?Good.
577,00:31:24.79,00:31:24.79,">> Tom. Done.>> No matter, no matter what's"
578,00:31:27.96,00:31:27.96,wrong with James' leg.>> James' leg; he's still
579,00:31:30.08,00:31:30.08,"stronger than Tom.>> All right, good."
580,00:31:32.38,00:31:32.38,>> Tom.>> Why? I feel like this is
581,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,the dumbest move.He can't run!
582,00:31:39.08,00:31:39.08,"I mean, are we being stupid?>> I can't run."
583,00:31:43.00,00:31:43.00,"If that's the criteria, thenyou should have put me out."
584,00:31:47.08,00:31:47.08,>> I feel like this is like areally risky move.
585,00:31:55.04,00:31:55.04,>> Maybe.Let's just think about it hard.
586,00:32:02.67,00:32:02.67,Decide together.>> Yeah.
587,00:32:05.50,00:32:05.50,>> We got the afternoon to thinkabout it.
588,00:32:07.62,00:32:07.62,We need to think about it.>> Yeah.

596,00:32:29.21,00:32:29.21,">> Logically, I should voteout James tonight."
597,00:32:34.33,00:32:34.33,"But if I were to try anythingsnakey again, I'm around Rupert,"
598,00:32:38.21,00:32:38.21,"James and Amanda.That would put myself in a,"
599,00:32:40.62,00:32:40.62,in a bad spot.>> Candice is pushing hard
600,00:32:43.88,00:32:43.88,for James.If we're going totally on
601,00:32:46.42,00:32:46.42,"strength, Candice's buttis the weakest."
602,00:32:48.54,00:32:48.54,We vote Candice's butt out.>> Yep.

606,00:33:01.96,00:33:01.96,"James is okay, right?>> No. I don't know."
607,00:33:07.21,00:33:07.21,">> It's just more logical to do,to vote James out."

609,00:33:14.21,00:33:14.21,James is the onethat's injured.

611,00:33:17.96,00:33:17.96,you and I because we can goeither way.
612,00:33:20.25,00:33:20.25,"Tilt the thing either way.>> God, I hope J.T. votes good."
613,00:33:25.21,00:33:25.21,>> J.T. cannot cross us.>> This is so stupid because
614,00:33:30.62,00:33:30.62,"J.T. didn't vote with us lastTribal Council, but I'm really"
615,00:33:34.00,00:33:34.00,depending on his vote tonight.'Cause if he doesn't vote with
616,00:33:38.04,00:33:38.04,"us, that means he's voting withTom, Colby and Candice"
617,00:33:41.62,00:33:41.62,against James.>> It makes perfect sense to get
618,00:33:43.83,00:33:43.83,"rid of James.I mean, there's no logic"
619,00:33:46.08,00:33:46.08,in voting to keep James andgetting rid of you.
620,00:33:49.33,00:33:49.33,You don't even have to pleadyour story.
621,00:33:51.58,00:33:51.58,>> Mm-mm.>> I'm happy to hear that

627,00:34:08.50,00:34:08.50,I need J.T. and Candice to seethe logic in sticking with Colby
628,00:34:11.92,00:34:11.92,and I and eliminatingJames tonight.
629,00:34:16.25,00:34:16.25,I'm pretty sure Candice iswith us.
630,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,And I'm hoping that J.T. seesthe light.
631,00:34:21.62,00:34:21.62,>> J.T....>> I was thinking your way.

638,00:34:47.71,00:34:47.71,"I'm sure he's with us.>> Where's J., where's J.T. on"

643,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,It should be James.>> I think tonight James should
644,00:35:06.08,00:35:06.08,be the one.>> Makes all the logical sense
645,00:35:08.42,00:35:08.42,to get rid of James.>> We're going to another Tribal
646,00:35:12.62,00:35:12.62,Council and most everybody'slooking to J.T. for a vote.
647,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,And the reason for that isbecause J. T. is so wishy-washy.
648,00:35:19.96,00:35:19.96,"J.T. flip-flops at everyopportunity that he has, you"
649,00:35:23.25,00:35:23.25,"know, because he's clearly justplaying the hand that suits"

656,00:36:10.21,00:36:10.21,"I popped it, and I thought I wasokay, and I tried to stand up."
657,00:36:13.71,00:36:13.71,"And it doesn't hurt.It just, right now it's"

667,00:36:38.00,00:36:38.00,I want to believe that James isgonna be okay.
