6,00:00:12.25,00:00:12.25,>> I aligned with Foa Foa from the first time I went over to
7,00:00:14.04,00:00:14.04,their tribe. >> PROBST: Time for you to go.
8,00:00:17.17,00:00:17.17,But now that they're in the majority...
9,00:00:19.25,00:00:19.25,>> There is definitely part of me that wants to make a big

11,00:00:23.33,00:00:23.33,have become clouded by thoughts of the endgame.
12,00:00:25.42,00:00:25.42,>> Mick is freaking out. That worries me that he's gonna
13,00:00:28.79,00:00:28.79,send me home 'cause that's what I would do.
14,00:00:31.54,00:00:31.54,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! After Brett saved himself by"
15,00:00:35.17,00:00:35.17,winning immunity... Brett does not have to worry
16,00:00:38.25,00:00:38.25,"about going home tonight. ...Monica was on the hot seat,"
17,00:00:40.29,00:00:40.29,so she stirred up trouble around camp...
18,00:00:45.71,00:00:45.71,>> PROBST: ...in a desperate attempt to stay alive.
19,00:00:52.04,00:00:52.04,>> PROBST: But her plan didn't work...
20,00:00:54.04,00:00:54.04,>> You are a little snake in the grass.
21,00:00:56.04,00:00:56.04,>> PROBST: ... and the Foa Foa four sent her packing.
22,00:01:02.12,00:01:02.12,"Well, there are six of you left in this game now."
23,00:01:05.17,00:01:05.17,"Not everybody's gonna make it to the final, so, while it may"
24,00:01:08.08,00:01:08.08,"not have worked for Monica tonight, gonna be a lot more"
25,00:01:10.21,00:01:10.21,scrambling to come. Grab your torches.
26,00:01:12.75,00:01:12.75,Head back to camp. >> God!
27,00:01:27.08,00:01:27.08,"Wow! Thank you, thank you."
28,00:01:35.08,00:01:35.08,>> I love head rubs. I'm basically sitting around
29,00:01:38.54,00:01:38.54,the campfire that I've known for 33 days with an entirely
30,00:01:44.58,00:01:44.58,different group of people than I would have ever imagined.
31,00:01:47.17,00:01:47.17,">> Oh, my God! >> I'm the last true Galu, and"
32,00:01:50.92,00:01:50.92,"I'm a fighter, and I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing and"
33,00:01:53.42,00:01:53.42,make it as far as possible. >> That tribal wasn't too bad.
34,00:01:58.75,00:01:58.75,"I expected worse. Stay on our plan, and we'll be"
35,00:02:01.67,00:02:01.67,okay. >> Yeah.
36,00:02:03.79,00:02:03.79,">> And, uh, we-we just... Man, I'm going to push it to"
37,00:02:06.58,00:02:06.58,"the limits. Because if he don't go, we're"
38,00:02:12.17,00:02:12.17,gonna be in a world of crap. Monica going home was an
39,00:02:16.08,00:02:16.08,"extremely easy choice. It would have been Brett, but"
40,00:02:19.25,00:02:19.25,"because he won the immunity, then it had to be Monica."
41,00:02:24.29,00:02:24.29,"So, as soon as Brett loses, he's gone."
42,00:02:27.67,00:02:27.67,"He has to, because he'll keep winning and keep winning all"
43,00:02:30.46,00:02:30.46,the way to the top. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

48,00:03:48.17,00:03:48.17,definitely gonna try to work what I have here.
49,00:03:50.62,00:03:50.62,"And Natalie and I, you know, kind of come from, I think, a"
50,00:03:54.12,00:03:54.12,"similar walk of life, and I think something like that is a"
51,00:03:57.79,00:03:57.79,"great foundation for a trusting relationship, so, you know, I"
52,00:04:02.75,00:04:02.75,think that that personal interaction potentially could
53,00:04:05.25,00:04:05.25,turn into something fairly promising.
54,00:04:07.38,00:04:07.38,"""That you may be filled to the measure of all with the fullness"

57,00:04:18.21,00:04:18.21,"absolute sweetheart. I mean, Brett and I have had,"
58,00:04:21.88,00:04:21.88,"um, several discussions about the bible and about some"
59,00:04:25.17,00:04:25.17,"Christian books. Um, I've really enjoyed that, so"
60,00:04:28.12,00:04:28.12,it's been nice to have that in common.
61,00:04:32.46,00:04:32.46,>> I want to just keep lying here.
62,00:04:35.21,00:04:35.21,>> Mm-hmm. >> Oh...
63,00:04:42.33,00:04:42.33,>> I think I have to go wet my head down.
64,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,Look at my hair. (Russell laughs)
65,00:04:49.75,00:04:49.75,I need a haircut. >> Shambo said she needed a
66,00:04:52.58,00:04:52.58,"haircut. >> Oh, my goodness."
67,00:04:54.88,00:04:54.88,>> She should shave that ho' head.
68,00:04:57.29,00:04:57.29,Mullet went out in the '70s. It looks terrible.
69,00:05:00.25,00:05:00.25,Her hair is funky. You see Shambo-- that's where
70,00:05:03.62,00:05:03.62,she sneaks food. She puts it in her hair.
71,00:05:06.50,00:05:06.50,Nobody knows. Nobody can see it.
72,00:05:08.79,00:05:08.79,She puts bananas in there and-and pieces of coconut.
73,00:05:12.54,00:05:12.54,"It's nasty. Peanuts, all kinds of different"
74,00:05:16.38,00:05:16.38,stuff. It's kind of disgusting.
75,00:05:18.50,00:05:18.50,"If I didn't need Shambo, I would definitely get rid of her"
76,00:05:21.17,00:05:21.17,"because, you know, I know we got to look at that bush of hair"
77,00:05:23.42,00:05:23.42,"that she has, but I'm doing whatever it takes to win the"
78,00:05:26.00,00:05:26.00,"game. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
79,00:05:45.58,00:05:45.58,You guys ready to get to today's reward challenge?
80,00:05:48.17,00:05:48.17,>> Let's do it. >> Yes.
81,00:05:50.17,00:05:50.17,">> Oh, yeah. >> PROBST: For today's"
82,00:05:52.17,00:05:52.17,"challenge, you'll divide into two teams of three."
83,00:05:54.17,00:05:54.17,Here's how it works. There are a series of
84,00:05:56.25,00:05:56.25,intersecting ropes holding up coconuts.
85,00:05:59.08,00:05:59.08,"One at a time, you'll walk out and pull one rope out."
86,00:06:02.42,00:06:02.42,Your goal-- drop as few coconuts as possible.
87,00:06:06.38,00:06:06.38,"Every time you drop a coconut, it counts against your team."
88,00:06:10.21,00:06:10.21,First team to 100 coconuts loses.
89,00:06:13.04,00:06:13.04,The other team wins reward. I know you want to know what
90,00:06:15.75,00:06:15.75,you're playing for. >> Yeah.
91,00:06:17.75,00:06:17.75,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: The winning team
92,00:06:19.71,00:06:19.71,will leave here. You'll be taken to a local
93,00:06:21.71,00:06:21.71,village. You'll then have a massive
94,00:06:23.71,00:06:23.71,feast. You will spend the night in the
95,00:06:26.25,00:06:26.25,"village, sleeping on a mattress with a pillow and some blankets."
96,00:06:31.08,00:06:31.08,"Then, you'll return back to camp in the morning."
97,00:06:34.29,00:06:34.29,"On day 34, could be a big, big difference heading into the"
98,00:06:37.50,00:06:37.50,next immunity challenge. Worth playing for?
99,00:06:39.50,00:06:39.50,>> Yes. >> Definitely.
100,00:06:41.50,00:06:41.50,">> Oh, yeah. >> Worth dying for."
101,00:06:43.50,00:06:43.50,">> PROBST: All right, we're gonna draw for teams."
102,00:06:45.50,00:06:45.50,Looking for two captains. Yellow and purple are the
103,00:06:48.12,00:06:48.12,captains. Please don't look.
104,00:06:50.17,00:06:50.17,"Let me share in the surprise. All right, everybody, palms up."
105,00:06:57.42,00:06:57.42,Reveal. Russell is a captain.
106,00:07:00.96,00:07:00.96,"Natalie is a captain. All right, Russell, Natalie--"
107,00:07:04.29,00:07:04.29,"rock, paper, scissor to see who chooses first."
108,00:07:08.04,00:07:08.04,Paper covers rock. Natalie chooses first.
109,00:07:10.58,00:07:10.58,">> Uh, I'm gonna go with Brett. >> PROBST: Brett joins Natalie."
110,00:07:17.88,00:07:17.88,"All right, Russell, your choice. >> Jaison."
111,00:07:21.75,00:07:21.75,">> Mick. >> PROBST: Natalie chooses Mick,"
112,00:07:23.88,00:07:23.88,which means Shambo joins Russell.
113,00:07:27.21,00:07:27.21,"There's our two teams. Russell, Jaison and Shambo"
114,00:07:31.38,00:07:31.38,"taking on Natalie, Brett and Mick."
115,00:07:34.46,00:07:34.46,"Let's get started. All right, we have our two"
116,00:07:42.21,00:07:42.21,"teams. Yellow, you're up."
117,00:07:45.25,00:07:45.25,Shambo out on the course for yellow.
118,00:07:48.08,00:07:48.08,You can go on either side. The goal is simple-- pull a
119,00:07:51.33,00:07:51.33,rope out and drop as few coconuts as possible.
120,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,First team to 100 coconuts loses this challenge.
121,00:07:59.79,00:07:59.79,"What do you call that hair, Shambo?"
122,00:08:02.25,00:08:02.25,"(Shambo laughs) >> Shambolicious, baby."
123,00:08:04.62,00:08:04.62,>> PROBST: How long you had it? >> Since 1986.
124,00:08:08.46,00:08:08.46,>> PROBST: 23 years. That's a commitment to a
125,00:08:11.25,00:08:11.25,hairstyle. >> You don't mess with
126,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,"perfection, baby. >> PROBST: Shambo makes her"
127,00:08:16.12,00:08:16.12,choice for yellow. Releases the rope.
128,00:08:18.79,00:08:18.79,Now you got to pull it through. Starting to get a little rain.
129,00:08:22.62,00:08:22.62,That'll make it fun. >> Watch that one on the top
130,00:08:25.25,00:08:25.25,right. It's moving.
131,00:08:27.25,00:08:27.25,">> Be careful when you're pulling 'em, Sham."
132,00:08:29.25,00:08:29.25,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Shambo drops four
133,00:08:31.25,00:08:31.25,"coconuts. As this game will go, that's"
134,00:08:33.88,00:08:33.88,"not bad. >> Good job, Shambo."
135,00:08:36.92,00:08:36.92,">> Feels good, looks good. Aha, oo-rah."
136,00:08:38.92,00:08:38.92,"Love it, love it, love it. >> PROBST: Yellow, first on the"
137,00:08:42.92,00:08:42.92,"board with four. Purple, you're up."
138,00:08:46.12,00:08:46.12,"Mick heads out for purple. >> All right, Mick, nice and"
139,00:08:48.42,00:08:48.42,easy. Slow and steady.
140,00:08:50.83,00:08:50.83,>> PROBST: Mick makes his choice for purple.
141,00:08:53.79,00:08:53.79,">> Yes. Keep it coming, baby. >> PROBST: By simply releasing"
142,00:08:56.58,00:08:56.58,"the rope, two coconuts drop. >> It's okay, Mick."
143,00:08:59.17,00:08:59.17,"Hey, slow and steady. >> PROBST: This challenge is"
144,00:09:01.33,00:09:01.33,all about what you don't want. You don't want coconuts today.
145,00:09:04.33,00:09:04.33,Mick gets out with just two coconuts.
146,00:09:07.67,00:09:07.67,"Purple with two. >> Good job, Mick."
147,00:09:09.67,00:09:09.67,>> PROBST: Yellow has four. Jaison out on the course for

149,00:09:25.04,00:09:25.04,some sense out of this. >> Yeah.
150,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,">> Thank you, Jesus. >> PROBST: Jaison's made his"
151,00:09:40.08,00:09:40.08,choice. See how it goes.
152,00:09:43.17,00:09:43.17,Two drop right away. (Jaison sighs)
153,00:09:47.83,00:09:47.83,Here we go. That is a total of seven
154,00:09:56.04,00:09:56.04,"coconuts, bringing yellow's total to 11."
155,00:10:00.62,00:10:00.62,"Purple, you're up. Sooner or later, somebody's"
156,00:10:03.25,00:10:03.25,"gonna have a big pull, and a lot of coconuts are going to drop."
157,00:10:07.25,00:10:07.25,Natalie makes her choice for purple.
158,00:10:09.38,00:10:09.38,>> There's another one moving 'cause of the vibration.
159,00:10:11.38,00:10:11.38,Easy. You're doing good. >> PROBST: Natalie drops one
160,00:10:15.00,00:10:15.00,coconut. Natalie gets through with only
161,00:10:17.00,00:10:17.00,one coconut. Purple with only three.
162,00:10:21.46,00:10:21.46,"Yellow, you're up. Russell makes his choice."
163,00:10:26.21,00:10:26.21,Right off the bat. A bundle of coconuts drop.
164,00:10:30.92,00:10:30.92,"Eight more coconuts for yellow, bringing yellow's total to 19."
165,00:10:34.71,00:10:34.71,"Purple at three. >> Oh, going to get one."
166,00:10:37.04,00:10:37.04,>> PROBST: Brett can see one coconut hanging in the balance.
167,00:10:42.88,00:10:42.88,That coconut will drop. Purple with only four coconuts
168,00:10:46.67,00:10:46.67,right now. 19-four.
169,00:10:50.29,00:10:50.29,Shambo makes her selection for yellow.
170,00:10:54.04,00:10:54.04,"And right away, a whole lot of coconuts drop."
171,00:10:57.08,00:10:57.08,"Ten more added to their score. Yellow now at 29, purple"
172,00:11:00.58,00:11:00.58,sitting on four. Mick selects for purple.
173,00:11:09.00,00:11:09.00,Mick hasn't even started to pull the rope and coconuts are
174,00:11:12.12,00:11:12.12,falling. The gap is closing with each
175,00:11:17.21,00:11:17.21,"coconut that drops. >> You rock, God."
176,00:11:25.50,00:11:25.50,>> PROBST: Mick drops 19 coconuts.
177,00:11:29.12,00:11:29.12,"Just like that, yellow is back in this challenge."
178,00:11:31.96,00:11:31.96,>> I just couldn't see much. >> You got two prayer warriors
179,00:11:35.00,00:11:35.00,"on your team, so... >> PROBST: Jaison makes his"
180,00:11:37.42,00:11:37.42,"choice for yellow. >> Easy, J, nice and easy."

183,00:12:07.29,00:12:07.29,Purple at 23. Natalie has had good luck in
184,00:12:10.71,00:12:10.71,"this challenge so far. >> PROBST: Remember, the first"
185,00:12:16.46,00:12:16.46,team to 100 loses. Purple sitting pretty at only 23
186,00:12:20.25,00:12:20.25,coconuts. Natalie makes her choice for
187,00:12:23.92,00:12:23.92,purple. >> My prediction is 58.
188,00:12:26.83,00:12:26.83,">> PROBST: Russell, Jaison, and Shambo hoping a whole lot of"
189,00:12:30.00,00:12:30.00,"coconuts drop. >> Oh, my word, oh, my word."

191,00:12:39.67,00:12:39.67,>> PROBST: Natalie dropped 58 for purple.
192,00:12:43.04,00:12:43.04,">> Oh, my god, I guessed it. >> PROBST: Bringing their total"
193,00:12:45.08,00:12:45.08,to 81. This challenge gonna come down
194,00:12:47.50,00:12:47.50,to the wire. Russell heads out for yellow.
195,00:12:51.25,00:12:51.25,Yellow sitting on 77. Big move right here by Russell.
196,00:12:56.88,00:12:56.88,Russell eyeballing it for the yellow team.
197,00:12:59.58,00:12:59.58,There are very few ropes left in this challenge...
198,00:13:02.75,00:13:02.75,">> You got it, baby. >> PROBST: ...that will not drop"
199,00:13:04.29,00:13:04.29,"any coconuts. Russell makes his choice,"
200,00:13:08.50,00:13:08.50,releases the rope. Now you got to thread it
201,00:13:12.08,00:13:12.08,"through. >> Easy, baby."
202,00:13:17.04,00:13:17.04,">> Slow and easy, baby, slow and easy."
203,00:13:19.17,00:13:19.17,">> I can't look. >> Come on, baby, come on."
204,00:13:29.17,00:13:29.17,>> PROBST: Russell gets through without any damage.
205,00:13:31.71,00:13:31.71,No coconuts added to their total.
206,00:13:33.75,00:13:33.75,">> Dude, are you freaking kidding me?"
207,00:13:36.04,00:13:36.04,>> Nicely done. >> PROBST: Russell really
208,00:13:37.88,00:13:37.88,putting the pressure on purple. Brett up now for purple.
209,00:13:41.29,00:13:41.29,"Brett, you are sitting at 81 coconuts."
210,00:13:44.67,00:13:44.67,"19 or more, and your team is out."
211,00:13:48.08,00:13:48.08,It's all on you. This could be it.
212,00:13:51.12,00:13:51.12,">> Nice and steady, B. >> Easy pulls, easy pulls."
213,00:13:54.92,00:13:54.92,>> PROBST: Looking good so far. >> Come on.
214,00:14:01.62,00:14:01.62,>> Yes! >> PROBST: More coconuts for
215,00:14:03.79,00:14:03.79,purple. Brett gets through.
216,00:14:05.58,00:14:05.58,"Now, let's see what the damage is."
217,00:14:09.04,00:14:09.04,"23 coconuts, bringing them to 104."
218,00:14:12.83,00:14:12.83,It's over. Yellow wins reward.
219,00:14:16.12,00:14:16.12,"Russell, Jaison, and Shambo going on reward."
220,00:14:20.33,00:14:20.33,">> You all enjoy it. >> PROBST: Natalie, Brett, Mick,"
221,00:14:23.25,00:14:23.25,"got nothing for you. Grab your stuff, head back to"
222,00:14:25.17,00:14:25.17,camp. >> Have fun.
223,00:14:28.88,00:14:28.88,">> PROBST: Russell, Shambo, Jaison, enjoy your afternoon and"
224,00:14:32.33,00:14:32.33,your evening. You'll return to camp in the
225,00:14:34.25,00:14:34.25,"morning. Grab your stuff, head out."
226,00:14:36.92,00:14:36.92,Have a good time. >> Thank you.
227,00:14:38.83,00:14:38.83,>> Definitely concerned about Natalie after she picked Brett
228,00:14:41.17,00:14:41.17,and Mick. I'm starting to get more worried
229,00:14:43.21,00:14:43.21,"about inter-divisions that, you know, may be starting to appear"
230,00:14:48.12,00:14:48.12,"in our alliance. >> Hi, how are you?"
231,00:15:14.67,00:15:14.67,>> Talofa la. >> Thank you.
232,00:15:16.46,00:15:16.46,>> Thank you very much. >> That smells really good.
233,00:15:18.29,00:15:18.29,"When we won the reward, you know, reward didn't mean much to"
234,00:15:20.96,00:15:20.96,me 'cause I didn't know what a reward was.
235,00:15:23.00,00:15:23.00,"I'd never been on a reward. >> On behalf of our village, I"
236,00:15:29.17,00:15:29.17,"say ""Talofa."" It means ""Welcome."""
237,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,">> Thank you. >> Oh, my gosh."
238,00:15:35.46,00:15:35.46,">> You ain't lying, Shambo. Oh, my gosh."
239,00:15:37.62,00:15:37.62,You see what I'm seeing? >> This is the best part of the
240,00:15:40.79,00:15:40.79,"pig right there, baby. My favorite."
241,00:15:44.62,00:15:44.62,>> Every single day out here has been a grind.
242,00:15:46.62,00:15:46.62,Every single day out here has been a loss.
243,00:15:48.62,00:15:48.62,Every single day out here has been an attempt to survive
244,00:15:51.00,00:15:51.00,another day in the game of Survivor.
245,00:15:53.12,00:15:53.12,>> Mmm! >> This is really good.
246,00:15:55.04,00:15:55.04,"But once I got there, it was a completely different experience."
247,00:15:58.50,00:15:58.50,To have that day off was absolutely amazing.
248,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,(shouting) >> How's the lobster?
249,00:16:08.54,00:16:08.54,">> After eating all them crabs all that time, first thing I go"
250,00:16:11.04,00:16:11.04,"for is the lobster. >> Hey, lobster ain't crab, man."
251,00:16:14.42,00:16:14.42,">> As soon as I won the challenge, I thought that's"
252,00:16:18.00,00:16:18.00,"perfect for me because the food gives me energy, gets me pumped"
253,00:16:22.08,00:16:22.08,up. I'll take any edge I can get
254,00:16:24.67,00:16:24.67,right now. Lobster.
255,00:16:26.71,00:16:26.71,"Mick and Brett, it makes them weaker because they didn't get"
256,00:16:29.50,00:16:29.50,"to eat. They're going to be thirsty,"
257,00:16:31.96,00:16:31.96,"dehydrated, hungry, so I think it's a great thing that they"
258,00:16:35.88,00:16:35.88,didn't win today. >> My only goal right now is top
259,00:16:39.67,00:16:39.67,"three with you. All right, I can get down with"
260,00:16:41.33,00:16:41.33,"that. >> Yeah, I'm thinking exactly"
261,00:16:43.29,00:16:43.29,"the same thing. >> All right, we're good."
262,00:16:45.12,00:16:45.12,>> I would like to make a toast to the people of Samoa-- from my
263,00:16:49.08,00:16:49.08,"heart to your heart, thank you for the warmth, the food, the"
264,00:16:53.21,00:16:53.21,companionship. Thank you.
265,00:16:55.50,00:16:55.50,>> Cheers. (applause)
266,00:17:01.17,00:17:01.17,(laughter) >> What I most wanted to do in
267,00:17:05.12,00:17:05.12,Samoa was be part of that cultural experience with the
268,00:17:09.21,00:17:09.21,"native tribes here, and I was so happy."
269,00:17:13.17,00:17:13.17,It superseded my expectation. >> I have been fortified by the
270,00:17:25.04,00:17:25.04,"power of food, and I'm about to get jiggy with it."
271,00:17:27.58,00:17:27.58,"(Shambo shouts) >> Get it, Shambo."
272,00:17:31.71,00:17:31.71,Work it. >> To be able to share the
273,00:17:33.62,00:17:33.62,"experience with two of the guys, watch them truly enjoying"
274,00:17:38.79,00:17:38.79,"themselves, it was great. >> I got it, I got it."
275,00:17:42.75,00:17:42.75,>> I have to continue to build those relationships through the
276,00:17:45.62,00:17:45.62,"rest of the game, truthfully. It's a day-by-day thing out"
277,00:17:48.04,00:17:48.04,here. >> Three-way hug.
278,00:17:50.17,00:17:50.17,">> Nice job today, you guys. I love you guys."
279,00:17:55.96,00:17:55.96,>> I got an idea. I was thinking it'd be cool
280,00:17:58.25,00:17:58.25,"since, obviously, we're not on a lavish reward, but, you know, I"
281,00:18:01.88,00:18:01.88,think we could take it as a day to just take a break and enjoy
282,00:18:05.17,00:18:05.17,each other's company. I was thinking we could all go
283,00:18:07.25,00:18:07.25,get snails. >> I think that would be fun.
284,00:18:09.00,00:18:09.00,">> And then once we have all our food together, we can just take"
285,00:18:11.00,00:18:11.00,it all to the beach and just chill on the beach and watch the
286,00:18:13.17,00:18:13.17,sunset together. >> Super fun.
287,00:18:14.33,00:18:14.33,">> I think that's perfect, man, I was thinking the same thing."
288,00:18:16.25,00:18:16.25,">> Just no games, just enjoy ourselves."
289,00:18:17.96,00:18:17.96,">> I'm in, man, that sounds great."
290,00:18:19.67,00:18:19.67,That's exactly what I had in mind.
291,00:18:21.58,00:18:21.58,>> Who's in? >> I'm in!
292,00:18:23.17,00:18:23.17,">> Awesome. Reward, seriously."
293,00:18:24.92,00:18:24.92,">> Whoo-hoo! >> We lost the challenge today,"
294,00:18:27.33,00:18:27.33,so what we're planning on doing is just cooking up some food
295,00:18:29.92,00:18:29.92,"together. You know, in a weird way, create"
296,00:18:33.21,00:18:33.21,"a reward for ourselves. Actually, go to the right."
297,00:18:36.17,00:18:36.17,">> Oh, to the right? >> Yeah, to that rock."
298,00:18:38.12,00:18:38.12,I don't play this game overly aggressively.
299,00:18:40.04,00:18:40.04,"I don't want to get in people's faces, but at the same time, you"
300,00:18:42.42,00:18:42.42,"know, it's just cool to hang out with each other and nurture the"
301,00:18:44.92,00:18:44.92,relationships. I feel proud to be the last true
302,00:18:53.42,00:18:53.42,Galu member. (Mick chuckles)
303,00:18:55.25,00:18:55.25,'Cause it kind of feels like you invited some strangers over to
304,00:18:57.54,00:18:57.54,"your house, you know, to-- you know, and then they ended up"
305,00:19:02.33,00:19:02.33,"moving in and all your, all of your family left."
306,00:19:06.21,00:19:06.21,"It's kind of a, it's kind of a bizarre-- it's kind of a weird"
307,00:19:10.17,00:19:10.17,"feeling, but... >> Yeah."
308,00:19:12.71,00:19:12.71,"Sorry, man. >> No, man, it is what it is."
309,00:19:21.88,00:19:21.88,>> Brett and Mick and myself-- we just decided today we're
310,00:19:25.12,00:19:25.12,"going to have good attitudes, and we really just enjoyed each"
311,00:19:29.21,00:19:29.21,"other, and I like Mick and Brett a whole lot."
312,00:19:31.92,00:19:31.92,"In the bag? >> I got-- yeah, I'm just"
313,00:19:34.50,00:19:34.50,putting them up here. >> Okay.
314,00:19:37.71,00:19:37.71,Brett's an amazing person. If I have to be standing next to
315,00:19:40.58,00:19:40.58,"a Galu, you know, Brett is awesome."
316,00:19:44.04,00:19:44.04,But I've been in with Russell since the very first day.
317,00:19:48.17,00:19:48.17,"Honestly, it's the hardest thing to balance your heart and your"
318,00:19:50.79,00:19:50.79,"head as far as strategically, and then what your heart's"
319,00:19:54.67,00:19:54.67,"telling you. It is so tough, so, you know,"
320,00:19:58.46,00:19:58.46,"hopefully, my mind is thinking clear enough to look at the end"
321,00:20:02.42,00:20:02.42,to be able to win the game. >> Lord have mercy.
322,00:20:18.96,00:20:18.96,"Sheets and blankets, and I have a pillow."
323,00:20:22.46,00:20:22.46,">> This pillow is amazing. >> Yeah, it is."
324,00:20:25.12,00:20:25.12,">> Jaison, look. (Shambo laughs)"
325,00:20:29.08,00:20:29.08,"I'm in my little net. Dude, I'm seven all the time."
326,00:20:39.17,00:20:39.17,"I'm just a little goofball. That's what makes me happy,"
327,00:20:42.21,00:20:42.21,though. >> That's good.
328,00:20:44.21,00:20:44.21,>> Being silly. Being a grown-up is just so
329,00:20:46.29,00:20:46.29,overrated when you don't have to be.
330,00:20:48.75,00:20:48.75,">> So why do you-- honestly, why do you think Natalie picked"
331,00:20:50.75,00:20:50.75,"Brett first today? I mean, that was an interesting"
332,00:20:52.79,00:20:52.79,"choice for me-- to me. >> Dude, it was..."
333,00:20:55.00,00:20:55.00,">> Is that what you call it-- ""interesting""?"
334,00:20:57.04,00:20:57.04,>> Interesting. >> I'll tell you what I call it:
335,00:20:59.58,00:20:59.58,"very telling. >> You know, when I get back to"
336,00:21:02.08,00:21:02.08,"camp, I'm gonna have to bring Natalie to the side and"
337,00:21:05.21,00:21:05.21,"solidify-- you know, spend about two hours with her to, you know,"
338,00:21:09.67,00:21:09.67,solidify what we have because no telling what they're talking
339,00:21:12.54,00:21:12.54,"about over there. >> Yeah, that's true."
340,00:21:14.62,00:21:14.62,>> They're thinking that Natalie is aligning herself with Brett
341,00:21:18.12,00:21:18.12,and Mick. That ain't happening.
342,00:21:20.33,00:21:20.33,"I know, I know for a fact, Natalie's with me."
343,00:21:23.08,00:21:23.08,Let's say Brett wins immunity. We get rid of Mick.
344,00:21:26.21,00:21:26.21,"And then next time, let's say one of us wins."
345,00:21:28.25,00:21:28.25,We get rid of Brett. But the thing is I'm putting it
346,00:21:31.21,00:21:31.21,"in their head. Well, maybe something is going"
347,00:21:34.04,00:21:34.04,"on with Mick, Natalie, and Brett, so we're gonna have to"
348,00:21:37.96,00:21:37.96,"stop it immediately. Me, you, Jaison-- as soon as one"
349,00:21:41.92,00:21:41.92,"of Mick or Brett is gone, we are running the show."
350,00:21:47.38,00:21:47.38,My whole point of this is to get rid of Brett or Mick.
351,00:21:51.42,00:21:51.42,Those two are a big threat. They're likable guys.
352,00:21:54.33,00:21:54.33,Then there's nothing else that can stop me.
353,00:21:56.67,00:21:56.67,We gonna have to blindside everybody.
354,00:21:58.83,00:21:58.83,>> Yeah. >> Everybody left.
355,00:22:01.96,00:22:01.96,">> If you had said last week or a few days ago, ""Mick,"" I would"
356,00:22:05.08,00:22:05.08,"have been, like, ""You must have lost your mind."
357,00:22:07.42,00:22:07.42,"He's Foa Foa. I'm not doing that."""
358,00:22:09.46,00:22:09.46,"It's, like, now, I don't know. Peace."
359,00:22:14.96,00:22:14.96,(Russell laughs) (indistinct chatter)
360,00:22:28.71,00:22:28.71,">> ...what has transpired, and so I'm like this."
361,00:22:31.00,00:22:31.00,Here's... Here's our hut.
362,00:22:36.33,00:22:36.33,"It's a little round hut, right? It has a little tiki roof..."
363,00:22:55.04,00:22:55.04,>> They freaked out. Everybody.
364,00:22:57.04,00:22:57.04,Every single person there. >> Freaked out?
365,00:22:59.42,00:22:59.42,>> It made them want to get rid of Mick because you did that.
366,00:23:01.50,00:23:01.50,"They're like, ""Oh, you know, they might get together."
367,00:23:03.50,00:23:03.50,"Mick might be..."" Mick... No..."
368,00:23:05.50,00:23:05.50,>> Yeah. >> Mick might be...
369,00:23:11.29,00:23:11.29,>> And it's-it's so easy now. >> But it's okay because it
370,00:23:16.17,00:23:16.17,"don't matter what each individual thinks over there,"
371,00:23:18.67,00:23:18.67,'cause I'm in control of it all. (Natalie laughs)
372,00:23:21.67,00:23:21.67,">> You had no doubt in your mind, I hope..."
373,00:23:27.21,00:23:27.21,">> I had to think a little bit. >> Russell, from the very first"
374,00:23:30.21,00:23:30.21,"day, he told me, ""I'll take you to the final two if I can trust"
375,00:23:32.50,00:23:32.50,"you,"" and I was, like, ""You can trust me."""
376,00:23:34.67,00:23:34.67,"I've been completely honest with him, letting him know what's"
377,00:23:37.75,00:23:37.75,"going on, and, um, we've kind of been on the same page with"
378,00:23:41.58,00:23:41.58,"everything, so, we actually have quite a bit of power."
379,00:23:44.21,00:23:44.21,Two brains are better than one. >> Everything is perfectly fine.
380,00:23:48.12,00:23:48.12,It's more now than ever. >> It couldn't have worked out
381,00:23:53.92,00:23:53.92,better for us. >> Mm-hmm.
382,00:23:55.92,00:23:55.92,">> All I know is, someone has to beat Brett next time."
383,00:23:57.92,00:23:57.92,">> Yes, for sure. If it's not, then we've got to"
384,00:24:00.25,00:24:00.25,get rid of Mick. If we can prevent Brett from
385,00:24:02.21,00:24:02.21,"winning immunity, then today will be a wonderful day."
386,00:24:06.42,00:24:06.42,There's gonna be no argument. He has to go.
387,00:24:10.88,00:24:10.88,He's a little punk. He's 110 pounds.
388,00:24:14.21,00:24:14.21,He's not faster than me. He's not stronger than me.
389,00:24:17.33,00:24:17.33,So he's not a huge threat to win the challenges.
390,00:24:20.12,00:24:20.12,But he is a huge threat to win the million dollars.
391,00:24:22.75,00:24:22.75,It is done. They say don't get confident in
392,00:24:25.04,00:24:25.04,this game. You know what?
393,00:24:27.04,00:24:27.04,"I'm confident as hell right now. >> Since you are, then I am."
394,00:24:29.46,00:24:29.46,How about that one? (snorting)
395,00:24:40.38,00:24:40.38,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! You guys ready to get to today's"
396,00:24:49.71,00:24:49.71,immunity challenge? >> Yes!
397,00:24:51.71,00:24:51.71,">> Yup. >> PROBST: Give it up, Brett."
398,00:24:54.08,00:24:54.08,">> Got to do it. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
399,00:25:02.17,00:25:02.17,"is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, you will"
400,00:25:06.58,00:25:06.58,race out into a field where you must count the number of objects
401,00:25:10.71,00:25:10.71,in each of the six stations. You'll use tiles to remember
402,00:25:16.17,00:25:16.17,the number for each item you've counted.
403,00:25:18.75,00:25:18.75,You will then use those numbers to solve a combination lock.
404,00:25:22.17,00:25:22.17,The order of the numbers will be different for each person.
405,00:25:25.54,00:25:25.54,First person to get it right and break their tile wins
406,00:25:30.25,00:25:30.25,immunity and is guaranteed a spot in the final five.
407,00:25:33.08,00:25:33.08,"(Shambo sighs) Losers, you know the drill--"
408,00:25:35.79,00:25:35.79,Tribal Council. Somebody going home.
409,00:25:38.21,00:25:38.21,We'll draw for spots. We'll get started.
410,00:25:43.96,00:25:43.96,"Here we go, for immunity and a guaranteed spot in the final"
411,00:25:47.58,00:25:47.58,"five, survivors ready? Go!"
412,00:25:57.04,00:25:57.04,Six stations. Count the objects in each one.
413,00:26:03.17,00:26:03.17,">> One, two, three, four... (squealing)"
414,00:26:08.71,00:26:08.71,>> PROBST: There are six different stations.
415,00:26:11.38,00:26:11.38,"Your job is to count the objects in each of the stations, and you"
416,00:26:15.92,00:26:15.92,"need to be right, or that lock will not open, and you will have"
417,00:26:19.79,00:26:19.79,to come back and count again. Russell has a couple of numbers.
418,00:26:26.33,00:26:26.33,He's heading back. Jaison and Mick heading back
419,00:26:33.75,00:26:33.75,"with a couple of numbers. >> One, two, three, four..."
420,00:26:44.21,00:26:44.21,">> PROBST: Brett, Shambo and Natalie staying out here a long"
421,00:26:47.25,00:26:47.25,time. Russell's already counted two
422,00:26:49.75,00:26:49.75,"different sets of objects, gone back and returned."
423,00:26:53.29,00:26:53.29,"Natalie still counting the fish. >> Six, seven, eight..."
424,00:26:56.50,00:26:56.50,>> PROBST: Brett heading back. Natalie finally leaves the fish
425,00:27:07.42,00:27:07.42,station. Moving on to the octopus.
426,00:27:11.25,00:27:11.25,"(squealing) >> No moving, no moving."
427,00:27:13.25,00:27:13.25,(snorting) >> PROBST: Shambo with a big old
428,00:27:16.54,00:27:16.54,smile on her face heading back. Russell heading back again.
429,00:27:23.12,00:27:23.12,He's been to four of the six stations so far.
430,00:27:29.58,00:27:29.58,Brett finishes at the rocks. Mick heading back again.
431,00:27:35.46,00:27:35.46,Big immunity on the line. You don't want to go home
432,00:27:38.33,00:27:38.33,tonight! Brett heading back.
433,00:27:46.58,00:27:46.58,Brett trying to stay in this. Mick back again.
434,00:28:01.04,00:28:01.04,Mick and Jaison heading back with their final numbers.
435,00:28:07.08,00:28:07.08,Mick has all six numbers. He's starting to work on his
436,00:28:09.79,00:28:09.79,combination. Jaison getting ready to work on
437,00:28:12.08,00:28:12.08,his combination. Russell back again.
438,00:28:15.38,00:28:15.38,Russell now working on his combination.
439,00:28:20.50,00:28:20.50,>> 24 fish. >> PROBST: Brett finally has
440,00:28:23.96,00:28:23.96,all six numbers. Brett kicking it into high gear
441,00:28:26.54,00:28:26.54,now. Mick getting his numbers lined
442,00:28:28.38,00:28:28.38,up. Brett finally back.
443,00:28:32.12,00:28:32.12,Brett spent a lot of time out there.
444,00:28:34.12,00:28:34.12,He's got his six numbers. Brett now trying to catch up.
445,00:28:38.00,00:28:38.00,All four guys working on their combination.
446,00:28:42.33,00:28:42.33,"Now, it's a matter of who is going to finish first."
447,00:28:47.21,00:28:47.21,You need to be right or that lock will not open.
448,00:28:53.25,00:28:53.25,Jaison gives his a try. It is wrong.
449,00:28:56.25,00:28:56.25,Jaison heading back out. Going to have to recount.
450,00:28:58.88,00:28:58.88,Russell getting his numbers lined up.
451,00:29:02.21,00:29:02.21,We got a race. Mick's at his final number.
452,00:29:06.33,00:29:06.33,Brett's at his. Mick gives it a try.
453,00:29:12.29,00:29:12.29,He's wrong. Brett lining up his last number.
454,00:29:15.04,00:29:15.04,"Took him a long time but if he's right, he wins."
455,00:29:17.79,00:29:17.79,Is he? Yes!
456,00:29:21.04,00:29:21.04,Brett wins immunity! Guaranteed a spot in the final
457,00:29:25.04,00:29:25.04,"five. >> Good job, Brett."
458,00:29:30.75,00:29:30.75,">> Thanks. >> PROBST: Brett, come on over."
459,00:29:35.25,00:29:35.25,"Back again. Once again, Brett is safe at"
460,00:29:42.21,00:29:42.21,Tribal Council. Guaranteed a spot in the final
461,00:29:44.46,00:29:44.46,"five. Shambo, Russell, Jaison,"
462,00:29:48.08,00:29:48.08,"Natalie, Mick-- after 36 long days, one of you going home"
463,00:29:52.33,00:29:52.33,tonight. Grab your stuff.
464,00:29:54.12,00:29:54.12,Head back to camp. I'll see you at Tribal.
465,00:29:56.75,00:29:56.75,">> It's so frustrating, Brett winning two in a row."
466,00:29:59.79,00:29:59.79,He might win three. What if he wins four?
467,00:30:02.00,00:30:02.00,"Then, we're screwed. Russell and I said it, if Brett"
468,00:30:05.25,00:30:05.25,"wins immunity again, that we would get rid of Mick."
469,00:30:07.12,00:30:07.12,But I think that Shambo's just not helping in the challenges to
470,00:30:09.29,00:30:09.29,"beat Brett so, you know, tonight's Shambo's night."
471,00:30:12.79,00:30:12.79,And we're just gonna get rid of her.
472,00:30:55.33,00:30:55.33,>> He wants to get rid of Mick. It's like he ain't talking nok.
473,00:31:01.79,00:31:01.79,more the rest of the day. He said he's too aggravated.
474,00:31:06.25,00:31:06.25,He said he don't want to deal With Mick I ain't talking to
475,00:31:08.50,00:31:08.50,you the rest of the day. That's the plan. That's it.
476,00:31:10.62,00:31:10.62,And he walked away. I don't really want to talk
477,00:31:12.79,00:31:12.79,"about it, either. We just get back to camp and"
478,00:31:15.17,00:31:15.17,"Jaison walks up to me immediately and says, ""hey, you"
479,00:31:19.17,00:31:19.17,"know what has to happen. We got to get rid of Shambo."""
480,00:31:23.08,00:31:23.08,But I didn't want to do it this route.
481,00:31:25.12,00:31:25.12,I want to get Mick out of here first.
482,00:31:27.50,00:31:27.50,"Right now, it's Mick. >> Okay."
483,00:31:29.29,00:31:29.29,>> That was the plan from the beginning.
484,00:31:30.96,00:31:30.96,">> That was the plan. If he changes his mind, I'll"
485,00:31:33.00,00:31:33.00,let you know. >> He's just really frustrated.
486,00:31:34.46,00:31:34.46,">> Yeah, that's why he's walking off from everybody."
487,00:31:36.25,00:31:36.25,"I'm frustrated, too. We didn't want Brett to win"
488,00:31:39.17,00:31:39.17,immunity but he did. Worst-case scenario is for
489,00:31:42.17,00:31:42.17,Brett to keep winning. His whole crew is over there
490,00:31:46.42,00:31:46.42,"watching him on the jury, but right now, we have a decision"
491,00:31:49.46,00:31:49.46,to make-- either Mick or Shambo. >> His exact words to you were
492,00:31:55.25,00:31:55.25,"what? >> I went up to him, I said--"
493,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,"he walked over there, I said ""Still on, we voting Mick?"
494,00:32:00.38,00:32:00.38,"He's like, ""Yeah."" And then you walked up and he"
495,00:32:02.83,00:32:02.83,"walked away. >> See, that makes me a little"
496,00:32:04.96,00:32:04.96,"bit nervous but whatever. As soon as I walked up, Russ"
497,00:32:11.62,00:32:11.62,"and Jaison were talking, and Jaison bolted."
498,00:32:15.17,00:32:15.17,"And I said, ""What's that all about?"""
499,00:32:16.96,00:32:16.96,"And Russ is like, ""He's done talking."""
500,00:32:18.75,00:32:18.75,So that makes me a little uneasy.
501,00:32:20.71,00:32:20.71,Does Jaison want to vote me? >> He told me he wanted to
502,00:32:23.29,00:32:23.29,"still stay with Mick, but... >> He did?"
503,00:32:25.33,00:32:25.33,>> But then he just walks off after we finished the
504,00:32:27.71,00:32:27.71,"conversation, when you walk up. >> I know, that made me nervous."
505,00:32:31.17,00:32:31.17,I attributed more helpfulness to the Foa Foa tribe than
506,00:32:35.71,00:32:35.71,"anybody, and I don't think they're ever gonna forget that,"
507,00:32:39.00,00:32:39.00,"but I don't think anybody's beyond the chopping block,"
508,00:32:42.08,00:32:42.08,"including myself. >> And I'll tell you what, I"
509,00:32:56.17,00:32:56.17,don't even like her breath. And she always wants to talk to
510,00:32:59.75,00:32:59.75,you three inches away from your face and you gonna smell that...
511,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,breath. I don't even know why she's
512,00:33:06.50,00:33:06.50,still here. I know why she's still here.
513,00:33:09.25,00:33:09.25,'Cause we're using her stupid butt for votes.
514,00:33:12.96,00:33:12.96,">> Wow, that's the first time I've heard you talk about her"
515,00:33:15.12,00:33:15.12,like that. >> She's been getting on my
516,00:33:17.38,00:33:17.38,nerves since day one. We ain't buddy-buddy.
517,00:33:20.42,00:33:20.42,"She's gone. That's the plan, right?"
518,00:33:23.33,00:33:23.33,>> Absolutely. >> Yeah.
519,00:33:25.83,00:33:25.83,>> I was a little surprised. It was a little shocking.
520,00:33:29.29,00:33:29.29,"Russell has spent a lot of time with Shambo, you know,"
521,00:33:32.00,00:33:32.00,"cultivating that relationship, and, you know, now it sounds"
522,00:33:35.33,00:33:35.33,like he's kind of scheming to vote her off?
523,00:33:38.67,00:33:38.67,">> I can't wait till she's gone, dude."
524,00:33:40.96,00:33:40.96,One day without her would be heaven.
525,00:33:43.88,00:33:43.88,">> I think you've got to be skeptical all the time, and"
526,00:33:46.67,00:33:46.67,always assume that something else is going on in somebody's
527,00:33:48.83,00:33:48.83,mind. Every time somebody smiles at
528,00:33:50.88,00:33:50.88,"you, you know, what's going on, really, in their minds?"
529,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,Of course there's a chance that Russell is lying to me and they
530,00:33:55.71,00:33:55.71,"could be taking me out tonight. So, I mean, I'm anxious as hell."
531,00:33:59.62,00:33:59.62,It scares the hell out of me. He thinks it's you.
532,00:34:08.62,00:34:08.62,">> He does? Now, what in God's name would"
533,00:34:12.00,00:34:12.00,lead him to believe that? >> 'Cause that's what we had to
534,00:34:15.62,00:34:15.62,"tell him to make him shut up. >> Oh, really?"
535,00:34:19.17,00:34:19.17,I'm not comfortable. >> My decision tonight is
536,00:34:24.83,00:34:24.83,either Shambo or Mick. I can keep Shambo around 'cause
537,00:34:28.92,00:34:28.92,she's gonna not ever put my name down.
538,00:34:31.96,00:34:31.96,"She's horrible at the challenges, and she ain't gonna"
539,00:34:34.17,00:34:34.17,get any votes for the million dollars.
540,00:34:36.33,00:34:36.33,"That's three good reasons, extremely good reasons."
541,00:34:39.25,00:34:39.25,"The only good reason to keep Mick around, there's one-- and"
542,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,that's to keep athletes together to be able to beat
543,00:34:46.83,00:34:46.83,Brett in the next immunity challenge.
544,00:34:49.08,00:34:49.08,"So right now, I'm really not sure what I'm gonna do."
545,00:34:54.04,00:34:54.04,>> Are you going to play it? >> I'm just going to put it
546,00:34:56.50,00:34:56.50,around my neck and walk in there like Russell being
547,00:34:59.08,00:34:59.08,Russell. >> This is the last time you
548,00:35:00.88,00:35:00.88,"can play that thing, right? >> This is it. Yeah, 36."
549,00:35:03.12,00:35:03.12,>> 36. >> The hidden immunity idol--
550,00:35:05.04,00:35:05.04,I'm going to have it around my my neck.
551,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,Today is the last day I can play it.
552,00:35:07.79,00:35:07.79,"Even if I didn't have it I wouldn't be getting voted off,"
553,00:35:10.17,00:35:10.17,"but I have it, so I'll be fine. >> PROBST: We'll now bring in"
554,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,"the members of our jury. Erik, Kelly, Laura, John, Dave,"
555,00:35:44.58,00:35:44.58,and Monica voted out at the last Tribal Council.
556,00:35:54.12,00:35:54.12,"All right, Russell, one Tribal after another, you've voted out"
557,00:35:58.29,00:35:58.29,"former Galu members. We get to tonight, there's"
558,00:36:01.67,00:36:01.67,"really only one true former Galu left, because Shambo's"
559,00:36:05.46,00:36:05.46,been with you guys for a long time.
560,00:36:07.58,00:36:07.58,>> I'm a traitor. (laughs)
561,00:36:09.50,00:36:09.50,">> PROBST: that's a fair statement, right?"
562,00:36:11.04,00:36:11.04,">> Absolutely. >> PROBST: So, Natalie, when"
563,00:36:13.71,00:36:13.71,"you think about voting somebody out tonight, Shambo betrayed"
564,00:36:16.92,00:36:16.92,everybody on the jury. You can't win without some of
565,00:36:20.96,00:36:20.96,those people voting for you. Not going to happen.
566,00:36:23.50,00:36:23.50,">> Yeah, absolutely. I don't think that they would"
567,00:36:26.25,00:36:26.25,"vote for her, based off of that. So, it is a-- opportunity to"
568,00:36:30.00,00:36:30.00,keep someone that I think I can beat.
569,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,">> PROBST: So, Russell, how big a factor is that loyalty with"
570,00:36:35.83,00:36:35.83,Shambo going into a vote like this?
571,00:36:38.54,00:36:38.54,>> I think that she's helped us tremendously.
572,00:36:41.54,00:36:41.54,And I trust Shambo as much as I trust the Foa Foa members.
573,00:36:47.04,00:36:47.04,>> PROBST: That's a big statement.
574,00:36:49.50,00:36:49.50,>> I do. >> PROBST: So what kind of
575,00:36:52.25,00:36:52.25,criteria comes into play tonight?
576,00:36:55.21,00:36:55.21,">> There's phases to this game. Right now, we're in the end"
577,00:36:58.62,00:36:58.62,phase. And that phase is who's gonna
578,00:37:01.33,00:37:01.33,get the most votes for the million dollars.
579,00:37:04.58,00:37:04.58,">> PROBST: Jaison, do you agree with that?"
580,00:37:07.38,00:37:07.38,>> I definitely think that in terms of voting somebody off
581,00:37:10.21,00:37:10.21,"tonight, we have to think about someone who can beat us at the"
582,00:37:12.50,00:37:12.50,"end, and so I think everybody thinks Brett is the one guy"
583,00:37:15.96,00:37:15.96,"that could sweep a jury. But, you know, he's eluded us"
584,00:37:18.92,00:37:18.92,"two challenges in a row, and so we got to go big or go home"
585,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"here in the last few days. >> PROBST: Shambo, spell it out."
586,00:37:25.17,00:37:25.17,Why is Brett a big threat? >> Brett's' a big threat
587,00:37:28.12,00:37:28.12,because he's incredibly physical.
588,00:37:30.46,00:37:30.46,He's good at puzzles. He stayed loyal to a fault to
589,00:37:34.17,00:37:34.17,"Galu, and the jury is Galu. >> PROBST: So, Brett, at this"
590,00:37:38.21,00:37:38.21,"point, do you feel the only way you stay in this game is to win"
591,00:37:41.12,00:37:41.12,"immunity? >> Yeah, I mean, by doing so,"
592,00:37:43.96,00:37:43.96,"you know, it gives me one step farther ahead."
593,00:37:46.12,00:37:46.12,So my strategy is just to win the next few immunity
594,00:37:49.79,00:37:49.79,challenges like I've done the last few.
595,00:37:52.21,00:37:52.21,">> PROBST: Mick, it was you and Brett today in that challenge."
596,00:37:55.42,00:37:55.42,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: So you're, clearly,"
597,00:37:57.50,00:37:57.50,"one of the other strong, physical threats in this game."
598,00:38:00.46,00:38:00.46,"So if it's you tonight, what's the reaction?"
599,00:38:03.04,00:38:03.04,">> Of course I'll be frustrated. You know, having been part of"
600,00:38:06.08,00:38:06.08,this whole thing from the get-go.
601,00:38:08.12,00:38:08.12,I haven't played as aggressively a strategic game
602,00:38:10.96,00:38:10.96,"as Russell, but, you know, I've always been loyal."
603,00:38:14.12,00:38:14.12,"So after all this, to go home tonight, yeah, I will be a"
604,00:38:17.29,00:38:17.29,"little pissed off, for sure. >> PROBST: Russell, seeing how"
605,00:38:21.04,00:38:21.04,"far Mick, Shambo, you, Jaison and Natalie have come together,"
606,00:38:25.88,00:38:25.88,it's got to be tough tonight. One of you is going home.
607,00:38:28.96,00:38:28.96,>> It hasn't been a tough time yet for me to vote somebody out.
608,00:38:34.04,00:38:34.04,This is the first time that it's going to be pretty tough
609,00:38:37.33,00:38:37.33,for me. But this is how the game goes.
610,00:38:40.21,00:38:40.21,And sometimes you got to vote people out that you like.
611,00:38:45.46,00:38:45.46,">> PROBST: All right, let's get to the vote."
612,00:38:47.29,00:38:47.29,"Brett, once again you have individual immunity."
613,00:38:49.17,00:38:49.17,I don't think there's any doubt you are keeping it.
614,00:38:51.17,00:38:51.17,">> I'm definitely keeping it, Jeff."
615,00:38:52.75,00:38:52.75,>> PROBST: Cannot vote for Brett.
616,00:38:54.21,00:38:54.21,Everybody else is fair game. It's time to vote.
617,00:38:56.21,00:38:56.21,"Mick, you're up. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
618,00:39:38.79,00:39:38.79,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
619,00:39:52.25,00:39:52.25,If you have the hidden immunity idol around your neck and you
620,00:39:56.67,00:39:56.67,"want to play it, tonight is the last time you can do so."
621,00:40:01.12,00:40:01.12,">> You know what, Jeff? I think I'm gonna keep it for a"
622,00:40:03.25,00:40:03.25,"souvenir. >> PROBST: Okay, once the votes"
623,00:40:06.29,00:40:06.29,"are read, the decision is final. The person voted out will be"
624,00:40:08.79,00:40:08.79,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
625,00:40:11.00,00:40:11.00,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Shambo."
626,00:40:20.83,00:40:20.83,"Mick. One vote Shambo, one vote Mick."
627,00:40:26.08,00:40:26.08,"Shambo. That's two votes Shambo, one"
628,00:40:29.50,00:40:29.50,vote Mick. Shambo.
629,00:40:35.96,00:40:35.96,"Three votes Shambo, one vote Mick."
630,00:40:41.96,00:40:41.96,"13th person voted out, the seventh member of our jury,"
631,00:40:45.71,00:40:45.71,Shambo. That's four.
632,00:40:47.62,00:40:47.62,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
633,00:40:55.12,00:40:55.12,"Shambo, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
634,00:41:01.42,00:41:01.42,">> Thank you. >> Good luck, you guys."
635,00:41:13.29,00:41:13.29,">> PROBST: Well, there's only one thing standing in the way"
636,00:41:16.62,00:41:16.62,of the Foa Foa foursome making it all the way to the final
637,00:41:19.88,00:41:19.88,four. And his name is Brett.
638,00:41:22.50,00:41:22.50,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
639,00:41:24.58,00:41:24.58,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for
640,00:41:39.54,00:41:39.54,scenes from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time...
641,00:41:48.08,00:41:48.08,On a very special two-hour season finale.
642,00:41:51.96,00:41:51.96,"After 37 days, 15 have lost the battle."
643,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,"Now for the final five, it's war."
644,00:42:10.17,00:42:10.17,">> The Foa Foa is a very, very loyal group."
645,00:42:13.54,00:42:13.54,And although I helped to get them where they are in the
646,00:42:16.46,00:42:16.46,"positions they're gonna finally land in, they were loyal and"
647,00:42:19.12,00:42:19.12,"true to their tribe, as it should be."
648,00:42:21.58,00:42:21.58,I think that's awesome. I want to thank all the members
649,00:42:24.04,00:42:24.04,that have served in the military.
650,00:42:25.46,00:42:25.46,Oo-rah. Semper fi. I did the best job I could out
651,00:42:28.21,00:42:28.21,here and I hope you're all proud of me.
