559,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,and then they told her that shewas fine and there was no
560,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,traces of cancer.She was a newlywed when the
561,00:34:11.46,00:34:11.46,"cancer was found.>> Oh, you're kidding."
562,00:34:13.50,00:34:13.50,">> She'd only been married,like, 18 months."
563,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,And then she went in for a scanand they said it was full-blown

573,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,I was like God dang it.Who died?
574,00:35:07.04,00:35:07.04,Because I didn't know.>> Come on.
575,00:35:15.92,00:35:15.92,Where's our sunshine?>> Laura and I did not have a
576,00:35:20.96,00:35:20.96,heart-to-heart conversation.Laura invaded a private moment
577,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,that I was having on the beachwhere I was really homesick.
578,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"I was missing my family, and Istarted think thinking about my"
579,00:35:31.25,00:35:31.25,sister that passed away over 20years ago.
580,00:35:33.67,00:35:33.67,"I was just, I was pretty muchbroken down and sad, and she"
581,00:35:36.54,00:35:36.54,wanted to play buddy-buddywith me.
582,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,"And her little ""reach out andtouch me"" superficial bull..."
583,00:35:44.17,00:35:44.17,>> Be thankful that you're here.We have 20 more days.
584,00:35:47.88,00:35:47.88,>> I feel like the girls outhere are out to get me.
585,00:35:51.00,00:35:51.00,">> Well I think you're a lot--you're self-paranoid, too."
586,00:35:53.54,00:35:53.54,"I think the more paranoid youare, the worse it gets."
587,00:35:56.96,00:35:56.96,">> I don't think I'm paranoid,though, Lolo, I don't."

590,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,I want no conversations withher.
591,00:36:09.17,00:36:09.17,"You don't even like me, and youwant to sit here and pretend"
592,00:36:12.04,00:36:12.04,"like you're befriending me.It's just, like don't make me"
593,00:36:15.17,00:36:15.17,"throw up on your face.>> PROBST: On day 27, Russell"
594,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67,"believed he had it all undercontrol, so he began to make"
595,00:36:32.88,00:36:32.88,moves to ensure his safetyfurther in the game.
596,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,>> I'm in control of this game.Everything has worked for me so
597,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,"far.I set up my alliance so strong,"
598,00:36:42.71,00:36:42.71,"my four people, including me,they come up to me."
599,00:36:45.29,00:36:45.29,They tell me everything.And you have to be able to
600,00:36:48.79,00:36:48.79,"outwit them, even if it's yourbest alliance."
601,00:36:50.42,00:36:50.42,"You have to be able to outwitthem, too."
602,00:36:53.58,00:36:53.58,"They're going to turn on you,Foa Foa."
603,00:36:56.71,00:36:56.71,Believe it when I say it.I'm the one that's going to
604,00:36:59.92,00:36:59.92,take you.They'll get rid of you.
605,00:37:03.92,00:37:03.92,Yeah.Who do you think's going to be
606,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,gone first?>> It feels really good to be
607,00:37:24.29,00:37:24.29,"aligned with Russell.I mean, he is the most powerful"
608,00:37:28.00,00:37:28.00,"player in this game.He knows that whatever he votes,"
609,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,"I vote, too.So really he's got two votes no"
610,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,"matter what, any way he wantsto play it."
611,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,"It may, you know, mess me up inthe end, but I've made it this"
612,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"far, so, you know, I'm justgoing to trust him, and we'll go"
613,00:37:44.71,00:37:44.71,"with it, and I'm hoping thatI'll be in the final two."
614,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,">> Now, I want to you promise meone thing I'll never ask you"
615,00:37:50.38,00:37:50.38,again.>> Okay.
616,00:37:52.38,00:37:52.38,">> When it comes down to brassknuckles, and it's just me and"
617,00:37:55.96,00:37:55.96,"you and somebody else, you haveto swear to me you ain't going"
618,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,to think that I'm going to beatyou because I played the game
619,00:38:01.88,00:38:01.88,better and vote me off.Swear on Mick.
620,00:38:03.92,00:38:03.92,You're going to start thinking.That's a lot of money.
621,00:38:06.00,00:38:06.00,Your brain's going to startworking.
622,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,>> It's... You know what?It's not worth the money to me
623,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,"to lose my integrity out here.If I give you my word, I give"
624,00:38:19.25,00:38:19.25,"you my word, and that's thebottom line."
625,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,">> All right.You know, it all comes to a head"
626,00:38:24.29,00:38:24.29,"sooner or later.>> For sure, I agree."
627,00:38:26.29,00:38:26.29,>> I would think my best partnerout here would be Natalie.
628,00:38:29.54,00:38:29.54,"You see, Natalie is my ticket toget rid of both Jaison and Mick."
629,00:38:34.67,00:38:34.67,"So she can go pretty far in thisgame with me, maybe all the way"
630,00:38:38.25,00:38:38.25,to the final two.'Cause who better to take?
631,00:38:40.04,00:38:40.04,There's no way she can beat mein votes.
632,00:38:42.62,00:38:42.62,She followed and did everythingI told her to do.
633,00:38:44.67,00:38:44.67,She wouldn't even know how totalk.
634,00:38:46.67,00:38:46.67,"She might even say, ""Oh, he'sright."
635,00:38:48.67,00:38:48.67,"Give it all to him.""You know, she's so sweet, I love"

638,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,their freefall.>> I just wish there was a way
639,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,that Kelly were here so we couldkeep Galu together.
640,00:39:06.12,00:39:06.12,">> Well, it's not reality.>> I know. I know, I know."
641,00:39:08.21,00:39:08.21,>> That's not where we findourselves.
642,00:39:10.25,00:39:10.25,">> The game freaking changes.>> Well, the game changes every"
643,00:39:12.79,00:39:12.79,"day, but...>> Yeah."

652,00:39:35.62,00:39:35.62,"Drop the bull about Galuloyalty, 'cause there is none."
653,00:39:41.08,00:39:41.08,"It's Puff the Magic FreakingDragon, okay?"
654,00:39:44.04,00:39:44.04,">> But why, Shambo?>> That's a pipe dream."
655,00:39:46.04,00:39:46.04,>> Why?Why does it have to be that way?
656,00:39:48.83,00:39:48.83,">> Because you guys chose tovote for Galu before Foa Foa,"
657,00:39:51.17,00:39:51.17,and it broke.>> But it was different.
658,00:39:53.12,00:39:53.12,>> It's...>> He was turning his back...

661,00:39:59.04,00:39:59.04,">> That was different, though.>> It doesn't matter who it was"
662,00:40:01.33,00:40:01.33,or why it was.>> Right.
663,00:40:03.29,00:40:03.29,>> Purple is broken.Erik helped us win every single
