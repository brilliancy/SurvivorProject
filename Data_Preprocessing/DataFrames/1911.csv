3,00:00:16.38,00:00:16.38,The castaways have endured the mental...

5,00:00:32.62,00:00:32.62,This is the first 27 days of Survivor: Samoa.
6,00:00:39.38,00:00:39.38,Survivors ready? Go!
7,00:00:42.25,00:00:42.25,"On the battlefield, Galu was a powerhouse."
8,00:00:44.04,00:00:44.04,Galu wins immunity! Galu wins!
9,00:00:48.04,00:00:48.04,Galu wins! While Foa Foa paid the price.
10,00:00:51.04,00:00:51.04,The tribe has spoken. But a twist in the game...
11,00:00:54.96,00:00:54.96,>> I'm going to send my girl Shambo.
12,00:00:56.62,00:00:56.62,>> Excuse me? >> PROBST: ...sent Shambo to Foa
13,00:00:59.04,00:00:59.04,Foa's camp. >> I'll take a group hug.
14,00:01:01.83,00:01:01.83,">> We'd like to adopt her. I mean, she has just such great"
15,00:01:04.08,00:01:04.08,energy. >> PROBST: While Shambo spread
16,00:01:06.62,00:01:06.62,"the love, Russell spread nothing but chaos."
17,00:01:10.75,00:01:10.75,>> I'm telling you the truth. You're telling me I'm not
18,00:01:12.46,00:01:12.46,honest? You come up to me and threaten
19,00:01:14.29,00:01:14.29,"me, you got to go. >> PROBST: The tribe has"
20,00:01:17.00,00:01:17.00,spoken. He tore his camp apart
21,00:01:21.04,00:01:21.04,to find the hidden immunity idol.
22,00:01:23.00,00:01:23.00,">> In the history of Survivor, How many people found the idol"
23,00:01:25.92,00:01:25.92,without a clue? Boo-yah!
24,00:01:30.21,00:01:30.21,>> PROBST: Then Mother Nature pushed the castaways to their
25,00:01:32.92,00:01:32.92,breaking point. >> You need to sit down?
26,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,>> PROBST: And both tribes lost a member.
27,00:01:39.42,00:01:39.42,">> Russ, Russ, are you with us? Russell, Russell, wake up, mate."
28,00:01:47.08,00:01:47.08,>> PROBST: Galu faced the vote just once and went into the
29,00:01:50.08,00:01:50.08,merge eight strong. >> Congratulations Foa Foa and
30,00:01:53.08,00:01:53.08,Galu. You are now one tribe.
31,00:01:56.25,00:01:56.25,>> PROBST: While the Foa Foa four used merge to execute
32,00:01:58.71,00:01:58.71,"Russell's plan. >> The ones I know I can trust,"
33,00:02:01.67,00:02:01.67,they're doing exactly like I want them to do.
34,00:02:03.75,00:02:03.75,>> PROBST: And infiltrate Galu. >> Who get grapes fed to them?
35,00:02:07.17,00:02:07.17,The kings do. >> PROBST: With their backs
36,00:02:09.75,00:02:09.75,"against the wall, Natalie gained the trust of the Galu"
37,00:02:12.33,00:02:12.33,women and flipped the game. >> I don't trust Erik.
38,00:02:18.21,00:02:18.21,>> Erik? >> Our Erik?
39,00:02:19.67,00:02:19.67,>> Yes. >> PROBST: Seventh person voted
40,00:02:21.88,00:02:21.88,"out of Survivor: Samoa and the first member of our jury, Erik,"
41,00:02:25.71,00:02:25.71,The tribe has spoken. Foa Foa's stubborn
42,00:02:29.08,00:02:29.08,determination and Russell's keen eye for hidden idols...
43,00:02:32.08,00:02:32.08,>> That easy. >> PROBST: Enabled the four to
44,00:02:34.25,00:02:34.25,find the crack in the enemy fortress.
45,00:02:37.04,00:02:37.04,">> Oh, my God. It's a samurai sword."
46,00:02:41.46,00:02:41.46,>> PROBST: And Galu was hit hard.
47,00:02:43.71,00:02:43.71,>> I ain't finished playing just yet.

55,00:04:38.12,00:04:38.12,By navigating through the waters of the South Pacific to
56,00:04:41.79,00:04:41.79,a remote coast on the islands of Samoa.
57,00:04:46.08,00:04:46.08,Welcome to Survivor: Samoa. With only their first
58,00:04:51.17,00:04:51.17,"impressions to rely on, they began the game by electing"
59,00:04:54.67,00:04:54.67,chiefs for their two tribes. The better-looking Lennox Lewis.
60,00:04:58.25,00:04:58.25,"All right, Russell is the leader of Galu."
61,00:05:01.04,00:05:01.04,"Foa Foa, your turn. >> Guy green jacket, red shirt."
62,00:05:04.79,00:05:04.79,>> PROBST: We have a leader for Foa Foa.
63,00:05:07.12,00:05:07.12,It is Mick. >> Galu!
64,00:05:12.83,00:05:12.83,"Welcome home, guys! (cheers and applause)"
65,00:05:15.96,00:05:15.96,">> PROBST: Upon arriving at the Galu camp, Russell's style of"
66,00:05:18.29,00:05:18.29,leadership received a positive following.
67,00:05:20.92,00:05:20.92,">> Let's get it done. >> I felt, yay, we do have a"
68,00:05:24.08,00:05:24.08,leader. >> PROBST: And some early
69,00:05:26.17,00:05:26.17,alliances were formed. >> I will kill for you.
70,00:05:28.88,00:05:28.88,You're my leader so my role is to be your protector.
71,00:05:32.21,00:05:32.21,Just to make life a little bit easier...
72,00:05:34.38,00:05:34.38,">> that makes it a lot easier. >> 'Cause if they go for you,"
73,00:05:36.92,00:05:36.92,they have to go through me. I think Russell is a fantastic
74,00:05:39.04,00:05:39.04,leader and I love the fact that I'm notched right next to him.
75,00:05:41.38,00:05:41.38,I don't have it make any decisions.
76,00:05:42.79,00:05:42.79,I get to do all the dirty work. I wouldn't have it any
77,00:05:44.54,00:05:44.54,other way. If you're not the leader the
78,00:05:47.54,00:05:47.54,next best thing is to be the triggerman.
79,00:05:50.75,00:05:50.75,I'm here to work for you. That's my job.
80,00:05:52.67,00:05:52.67,">> Right, right. If I have one opportunity to"
81,00:05:54.79,00:05:54.79,"protect you, then I did my job. He's the main guy."
82,00:05:57.33,00:05:57.33,He's the big boss. I'm the guy behind the guy that
83,00:05:59.88,00:05:59.88,"you need to watch out for. 'Cause if you come to Russell,"
84,00:06:02.21,00:06:02.21,you're going to mess with me first.
85,00:06:04.79,00:06:04.79,">> PROBST: At Foa Foa, Mick was hesitant to call the shots and"
86,00:06:07.92,00:06:07.92,his passive guidance was sourly noted.
87,00:06:10.79,00:06:10.79,>> Where were you thinking of putting it?
88,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,"Where, with the...? >> Uh, well..."
89,00:06:15.12,00:06:15.12,">> Was it decided? >> Ben, what do you think, man?"
90,00:06:17.67,00:06:17.67,">> Yeah, we should just build it, like, simple and try to"
91,00:06:20.17,00:06:20.17,build it as sturdy as possible. >> As soon as Jeff said we
92,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00,"needed to choose a leader, the first thing that went through"
93,00:06:25.00,00:06:25.00,my head was just let me stay under the radar.
94,00:06:28.17,00:06:28.17,And so the first thing I did was to get rid of this and just
95,00:06:31.54,00:06:31.54,hang it up. Are we biting off more than we
96,00:06:34.88,00:06:34.88,can chew? What do you think?
97,00:06:36.25,00:06:36.25,"I mean, have you done this? >> I haven't done this."
98,00:06:37.88,00:06:37.88,">> my approach was kind of to be like, what, do you think"
99,00:06:40.71,00:06:40.71,"needs to be done?"" I don't want to make it a ""Ask"
100,00:06:43.58,00:06:43.58,"me what to do, I'm going to tell you."""
101,00:06:45.92,00:06:45.92,I think that's a little bit dangerous right now.
102,00:06:47.50,00:06:47.50,">> I don't know, do you think we should do water yet, or wait"
103,00:06:49.75,00:06:49.75,"until tomorrow? I mean, not that we..."
104,00:06:51.88,00:06:51.88,">> He's going to... I don't if we need, but it"
105,00:06:54.79,00:06:54.79,"wouldn't hurt, you know? Yeah, I think..."
106,00:06:58.12,00:06:58.12,"(sighs) Yeah, well..."
107,00:07:01.54,00:07:01.54,"Um. >> The captain leader, Mick,"
108,00:07:06.58,00:07:06.58,he's doing a very bad job. He sucks.
109,00:07:08.50,00:07:08.50,He can't even talk to anybody hardly.
110,00:07:11.88,00:07:11.88,He's not organized. He's not a leader.
111,00:07:13.71,00:07:13.71,"You know, he doesn't know how to make good decisions."
112,00:07:17.38,00:07:17.38,"The camp's a piece of crap, but, hey, I say good job"
113,00:07:21.00,00:07:21.00,because I don't want to do nothing.
114,00:07:23.12,00:07:23.12,I didn't come here to work. I came here to play.
115,00:07:25.21,00:07:25.21,"We is can have something, like, a secret alliance."
116,00:07:28.08,00:07:28.08,>> Okay. >> PROBST: Russell's strategic
117,00:07:30.21,00:07:30.21,maneuvering was always one step ahead of his tribe.
118,00:07:33.04,00:07:33.04,>> My tribe will believe anything I tell them at any
119,00:07:35.67,00:07:35.67,point because they're just stupid.
120,00:07:39.38,00:07:39.38,You can call me the puppet master.
121,00:07:41.50,00:07:41.50,They can be my little puppets. They'll run when I tell them to
122,00:07:43.92,00:07:43.92,run. They'll walk when I tell them
123,00:07:45.83,00:07:45.83,"to walk. When I'm finished with them,"
124,00:07:47.50,00:07:47.50,I'll just throw them in the trash.
125,00:07:51.17,00:07:51.17,">> PROBST: Under the cover of night, Russell wreaked havoc on"
126,00:07:54.92,00:07:54.92,his unsuspecting tribe. >> I plan on making it as
127,00:07:58.12,00:07:58.12,miserable as possible for everybody.
128,00:08:01.17,00:08:01.17,">> I think if I can control how they feel, I can control how"
129,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,they think. I'm going to do everything it
130,00:08:09.17,00:08:09.17,takes to win this game. >> I would prefer to have
131,00:08:12.33,00:08:12.33,someone next to me because it's so cold.
132,00:08:15.42,00:08:15.42,"Russell, you want to come sleep next to me?"
133,00:08:17.79,00:08:17.79,>> Yeah. >> Okay.
134,00:08:19.29,00:08:19.29,>> It's funny how any girl at any level will cuddle with you
135,00:08:24.83,00:08:24.83,"at night because it's freezing out here, and it is very"
136,00:08:28.21,00:08:28.21,strategic. If you're cuddling with them
137,00:08:38.79,00:08:38.79,"and you're rubbing their leg or their arm, they think, ""I've"
138,00:08:41.17,00:08:41.17,"got this guy. I got him where I want him."""
139,00:08:43.21,00:08:43.21,"You know what? If they think they got you,"
140,00:08:46.79,00:08:46.79,"they'll keep you along for the ride because they think, ""He"
141,00:08:50.08,00:08:50.08,really likes me. Let's not get rid of him
142,00:08:52.58,00:08:52.58,"because no way he's going to vote me out."""
143,00:08:55.71,00:08:55.71,You can have that in your back pocket without having an
144,00:08:57.83,00:08:57.83,"alliance with them. By the way, I'm happily married."
145,00:09:01.21,00:09:01.21,>> And I have the best boyfriend in the world.
146,00:09:03.08,00:09:03.08,>> You guys cuddle like you've been married for ten years.
147,00:09:06.62,00:09:06.62,">> This is a game we're playing. You're supposed to lie, cheat,"
148,00:09:11.08,00:09:11.08,and steal. That's how it works.
149,00:09:12.92,00:09:12.92,"What I do out here, my ma's going to probably be pretty"
150,00:09:16.08,00:09:16.08,damn embarrassed. My wife is probably going to be
151,00:09:18.21,00:09:18.21,"pissed off. I love my kids, my wife with"
152,00:09:21.25,00:09:21.25,all my heart. I wouldn't do nothing to hurt
153,00:09:23.58,00:09:23.58,my family. Everything I do out here is
154,00:09:25.79,00:09:25.79,playing the game. Every single thing I do is
155,00:09:27.67,00:09:27.67,"strategic, everything. >> PROBST: The Galu tribe"
156,00:09:36.75,00:09:36.75,continued to better their living quarters.
157,00:09:38.08,00:09:38.08,">> We can also, like, make baskets..."
158,00:09:39.92,00:09:39.92,He's a hairdresser! >> PROBST: And while the younger
159,00:09:42.62,00:09:42.62,"women easily connected with each other, Shambo was left on the"
160,00:09:45.38,00:09:45.38,outs. >> Wow.
161,00:09:48.04,00:09:48.04,You know what we're going to need?
162,00:09:50.25,00:09:50.25,What we need one of you guys to do is we need a palm frond
163,00:09:53.88,00:09:53.88,split up the middle. We need a really leafy one like
164,00:09:56.12,00:09:56.12,that. >> It's definitely a social
165,00:09:58.04,00:09:58.04,awkwardness that she has with everybody.
166,00:10:01.17,00:10:01.17,She just doesn't get when she does something that annoys
167,00:10:03.96,00:10:03.96,"people, she just doesn't get it. >> We can actually go collect"
168,00:10:07.46,00:10:07.46,coconuts and mangos and bananas and fruit.
169,00:10:10.29,00:10:10.29,>> She's 45 years old and you'd think by that time you'd get
170,00:10:13.50,00:10:13.50,"how to interact with people, and that frustrates me because"
171,00:10:17.08,00:10:17.08,I don't even like to-- be around her.
172,00:10:21.12,00:10:21.12,>> Just throw the fronds up there as long as they overlap.
173,00:10:24.96,00:10:24.96,>> I've never spent a lot of time with somebody like Shambo.
174,00:10:28.33,00:10:28.33,"The overt aggression, and the overt tomboyish behavior I"
175,00:10:31.42,00:10:31.42,"think puts a lot of people off, especially when you have pretty"
176,00:10:34.08,00:10:34.08,"girls here. Like, the hot chicks we have"
177,00:10:37.62,00:10:37.62,around here aren't as likely to connect with Shambo who just is
178,00:10:41.25,00:10:41.25,a brute. There's no way you can get
179,00:10:43.08,00:10:43.08,around that. It's in your face 24/seven.
180,00:10:49.46,00:10:49.46,(laughter) I just keep going.
181,00:10:51.21,00:10:51.21,"What is it, mullet? >> PROBST: At Foa Foa, Russell"
182,00:10:57.92,00:10:57.92,had no intention of providing for his tribe.

184,00:11:08.67,00:11:08.67,They lucky if they get a little bitty piece.
185,00:11:12.46,00:11:12.46,I'm not their daddy. I'm not gonna bring them
186,00:11:16.12,00:11:16.12,food. They're not my babies.
187,00:11:18.12,00:11:18.12,We're out here to win a million dollars.
188,00:11:20.33,00:11:20.33,It's right there in their face. All they got to do is look up
189,00:11:23.75,00:11:23.75,and it's right there. It's all over the place.
190,00:11:26.12,00:11:26.12,"So I'm gonna just keep eating, and if I find out that"
191,00:11:30.38,00:11:30.38,"somebody knows about my spot, I'm voting them out. (chuckles)"
192,00:11:36.12,00:11:36.12,>> What is that? >> PROBST: But he wasn't the

194,00:11:57.42,00:11:57.42,">> Lookit, let's eat a little bit."
195,00:12:01.42,00:12:01.42,">> Mmm, this is delicious. >> Cheers, guys."
196,00:12:10.21,00:12:10.21,">> Oh, my God! Cheers. >> Nice work."
197,00:12:12.29,00:12:12.29,">> Yeah, baby. >> Nice work."
198,00:12:13.25,00:12:13.25,">> Hell, yeah, I'm so glad. >> Sweet, huh?"
199,00:12:17.04,00:12:17.04,">> This is so great. >> Yeah, the ripe ones"
200,00:12:19.83,00:12:19.83,are beautiful. >> It goes down and then stops.
201,00:12:21.50,00:12:21.50,And it feels so good. >> Oh!
202,00:12:25.25,00:12:25.25,(laughter) >> I'm in heaven!
203,00:12:27.25,00:12:27.25,>> I know. >> No.
204,00:12:32.50,00:12:32.50,">> Okay, good. >> What papaya?"
205,00:12:35.04,00:12:35.04,(laughter) >> That's what I'm talking
206,00:12:39.21,00:12:39.21,about! Let's go.
207,00:12:42.50,00:12:42.50,Let's do this. (sing-songy): I'm not sharing.
208,00:12:49.00,00:12:49.00,">> PROBST: After winning the first immunity challenge, Galu"
209,00:12:52.71,00:12:52.71,took home flint. >> A big ol' mound full of it.
210,00:12:58.71,00:12:58.71,>> Yeah! >> Give it a little blow.
211,00:13:00.54,00:13:00.54,"No, not from above. From the side."
212,00:13:02.33,00:13:02.33,">> No, no, no, no, no, hush. You guys shut up, please."
213,00:13:05.12,00:13:05.12,"Don't blow. Like fireworks, isn't it? Damn."
214,00:13:11.08,00:13:11.08,>> When we were making fire it was pretty frustrating because
215,00:13:14.04,00:13:14.04,Shambo really wanted to be the one to make fire.
216,00:13:16.83,00:13:16.83,"The problem, is Shambo doesn't really know how to make fire."
217,00:13:20.75,00:13:20.75,">> There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go."
218,00:13:23.46,00:13:23.46,">> Now you blow lightly, very lightly."
219,00:13:25.12,00:13:25.12,>> Just don't let that go out. Keep it covered.
220,00:13:27.08,00:13:27.08,"Keep it covered here. It's all right, it's all right."
221,00:13:29.92,00:13:29.92,">> Man, I'm exhausted. >> It's okay."

226,00:13:43.38,00:13:43.38,flint on here? >> I would love to take a crack
227,00:13:45.79,00:13:45.79,"at it, but I would very much like to be in charge for the"
228,00:13:48.79,00:13:48.79,time I am doing it. >> Whatever.
229,00:13:50.17,00:13:50.17,"Now you're pissing me off. Okay, let's not have"
230,00:13:52.38,00:13:52.38,a conversation. >> Cool. No problem.
231,00:13:54.00,00:13:54.00,>> I'm serious. >> Where's that machete?

235,00:14:03.79,00:14:03.79,That's why you build a fire pit. >> Dave looks like he knows what
236,00:14:06.88,00:14:06.88,he's doing. I have faith that he's gonna
237,00:14:09.17,00:14:09.17,"make this happen, so let's just let it happen."
238,00:14:13.25,00:14:13.25,>> Dave's just a complete and utter moron.
239,00:14:16.04,00:14:16.04,He won't take assistance or help from anybody for anything.

241,00:14:23.12,00:14:23.12,"it just hit me the wrong way, you know."

246,00:14:36.29,00:14:36.29,"It's igniting. Oh, my gosh. >> Wait on it."
247,00:14:38.83,00:14:38.83,">> Back off that. No, it's all good."
248,00:14:40.79,00:14:40.79,It's all good >> It's going.
249,00:14:43.58,00:14:43.58,"Russell, we got this for you, baby."
250,00:14:46.08,00:14:46.08,">> Shh-shh-shh! >> Fire, you guys!"

255,00:15:09.25,00:15:09.25,down to he or I at the end somewhere and that was the only
256,00:15:12.42,00:15:12.42,"ammo I had against him, of course I'd use it."

261,00:15:38.42,00:15:38.42,lessons from Jaison's past came back to haunt him.

263,00:15:49.04,00:15:49.04,I want to say something. >> PROBST: Yes.

266,00:15:58.12,00:15:58.12,"coming for 'em, and that's the way it's gonna go down."
267,00:16:00.79,00:16:00.79,"So, hey, I'm gonna try to say the right thing."
268,00:16:02.04,00:16:02.04,"Congratulations, Galu, good job, but I'm coming for John in"
269,00:16:04.25,00:16:04.25,the next one. I'm coming for him.
270,00:16:07.12,00:16:07.12,I had a lot of emotions going today after that thing was over.
271,00:16:10.83,00:16:10.83,It just brought up a lot of stuff from the past that have
272,00:16:13.88,00:16:13.88,really been the motivating factor for why I try to succeed
273,00:16:16.50,00:16:16.50,"so much in life. I don't know who John is, but I"
274,00:16:20.38,00:16:20.38,"know guys like this, guys who get ahead by not playing"

277,00:16:31.38,00:16:31.38,The only thing that I'm really disheartened about is
278,00:16:34.33,00:16:34.33,"I'm coming for you."" Jaison, let's leave the blood"
279,00:16:36.92,00:16:36.92,on the battlefield. Nobody needs to get hurt.
280,00:16:38.92,00:16:38.92,>> Say the same thing to your teammate over there and then
281,00:16:41.21,00:16:41.21,"it'll all be good. >> Okay, stop."
282,00:16:43.25,00:16:43.25,">> I should not have said what I said to John, period."
283,00:16:45.92,00:16:45.92,"My dad grew up in rural Mississippi, got kicked off his"

286,00:16:53.67,00:16:53.67,And all the while he didn't complain.
287,00:16:55.17,00:16:55.17,He didn't moan. He just shut up and he got up
288,00:16:58.12,00:16:58.12,earlier the next day and he went out and won.
289,00:17:01.58,00:17:01.58,"And every time that say something like that, I feel"
290,00:17:04.08,00:17:04.08,like I let him down because that's not what I'm supposed
291,00:17:07.12,00:17:07.12,"to be doing, and I am more disappointed in myself right"
292,00:17:10.17,00:17:10.17,"now than anybody else out there. >> PROBST: Galu, back-to-back"
293,00:17:14.38,00:17:14.38,immunity wins. >> Whoo!

295,00:17:19.04,00:17:19.04,and I think that's why I came out here.
296,00:17:21.62,00:17:21.62,I came out here to prove something.
297,00:17:23.17,00:17:23.17,"I need to win, not just survive or make it to the next round."
298,00:17:26.33,00:17:26.33,"I need to win. >> PROBST: On day nine, Shambo"
299,00:17:36.67,00:17:36.67,had accidentally let loose one of Galu's hard-earned chickens.

301,00:17:44.25,00:17:44.25,continued to elude capture... ...it became a personal quest
302,00:17:50.08,00:17:50.08,for Erik. >> Chicken.
303,00:17:52.04,00:17:52.04,>> Over there. (chicken clucking)
304,00:18:03.58,00:18:03.58,">> Is that it? >> At this point, I think it's"
305,00:18:07.79,00:18:07.79,more personal with Erik and the the chicken.
306,00:18:10.04,00:18:10.04,I think that he has to beat that chicken.
307,00:18:18.08,00:18:18.08,(clucking) (squawking)

316,00:19:18.33,00:19:18.33,(laughter) I wish I had on rain clothes.
317,00:19:20.50,00:19:20.50,">> So, at this point, would anything make y'all quit"
318,00:19:22.83,00:19:22.83,right now? I'm really a multimillionaire.

320,00:19:36.62,00:19:36.62,these people really are. They think that I'm some
321,00:19:40.17,00:19:40.17,redneck from the South that can't do anything.
322,00:19:42.29,00:19:42.29,"Well, you know what? I'm the richest man here."
323,00:19:49.29,00:19:49.29,">> No. What are you gonna talk about, Russell?"
324,00:19:52.29,00:19:52.29,">> It's obviously something if he won't tell, but hey..."
325,00:19:55.00,00:19:55.00, >> I know. >> Russell seems pretty solid.
326,00:19:57.08,00:19:57.08,"He's got that kind of Southern charm going on, he's got kids."
327,00:20:00.21,00:20:00.21,"You want to trust the, like, kind of Southern family guy"
328,00:20:02.58,00:20:02.58,"thing, but maybe that's his his shtick."
329,00:20:05.71,00:20:05.71,>> Does it really look like I'm a millionaire?
330,00:20:08.21,00:20:08.21,I'm playing all these people like fools.
331,00:20:11.08,00:20:11.08,There is a difference between book smarts and common sense
332,00:20:13.71,00:20:13.71,smarts. It seems like none in my
333,00:20:16.00,00:20:16.00,"group has any common sense, not a one of them."
334,00:20:18.88,00:20:18.88,But it's definitely not gonna catch up with me here 'cause
335,00:20:22.83,00:20:22.83,I'm tell nobody until the end. (laughs)
336,00:20:28.42,00:20:28.42,">> PROBST: The next morning, Mick still had doubts about"
337,00:20:31.38,00:20:31.38,Russell's honesty. >> Boo-yah!
338,00:20:55.58,00:20:55.58,"(both laugh) >> I knew you did, man."
339,00:20:58.04,00:20:58.04,I knew there was something... >> Really?
340,00:21:05.50,00:21:05.50,"Nice, man. Good for you. >> Mick is a good guy."
341,00:21:08.04,00:21:08.04,"If I tell Mick that I have money, he's gonna think he"
342,00:21:11.88,00:21:11.88,"can trust me even more. I mean, if I would have thought"
343,00:21:15.38,00:21:15.38,"that Mick would say anything about what I do for a living,"
344,00:21:18.42,00:21:18.42,then I wouldn't have told him. I was living in a trailer check-
345,00:21:22.08,00:21:22.08,by-check five years ago. >> Russell's a pretty savvy
346,00:21:28.62,00:21:28.62,"guy, so it doesn't really surprise me."
347,00:21:30.46,00:21:30.46,"I think we sort of, you know, bonded a little bit."
348,00:21:33.12,00:21:33.12,"I told him what I really did, too."
349,00:21:34.88,00:21:34.88,And so I think it was kind of a show of trust on both sides
350,00:21:38.04,00:21:38.04,"Because I can be judged based on, you know, my potential"
351,00:21:40.71,00:21:40.71,"earning income as well. You know, physicians still do"
352,00:21:42.79,00:21:42.79,pretty well. We're not murdering it like we
353,00:21:44.71,00:21:44.71,used to. But could somebody use that
354,00:21:46.46,00:21:46.46,against me? Absolutely.
355,00:21:48.04,00:21:48.04,"But, uh, you know, if it got down to he or I at the end"
356,00:21:51.04,00:21:51.04,"somewhere and that was the only ammo I had against him, of"
357,00:21:53.96,00:21:53.96,course I'd use it. >> We're trying to take you
358,00:22:00.75,00:22:00.75,deep into this game. >> I resent the fact that you
359,00:22:03.21,00:22:03.21,guys are taking me way into it. ... you guys?
360,00:22:07.33,00:22:07.33,">> Okay, I appreciate that. >> That's my pride."
361,00:22:10.21,00:22:10.21,The tribe of Galu is going to take me deep into the game.
362,00:22:14.58,00:22:14.58,"Oh, I'm so appreciative. These people can kiss my ass."
363,00:22:25.08,00:22:25.08,>> PROBST: On day 19 the tribes merged on
364,00:22:27.12,00:22:27.12,the Galu beach. ( cheers and applause )
365,00:22:31.50,00:22:31.50,">> Foa Foa, they think that they're going to strategize and"
366,00:22:34.00,00:22:34.00,"make friends. What's Samoan for ""Get the hell"
367,00:22:36.00,00:22:36.00,"off my island""? Nobody talks to Shambo, period."
368,00:22:40.96,00:22:40.96,>>Perfect. >> Let her...

370,00:22:45.08,00:22:45.08,"from their ally Shambo, but she wasn't in the mood to be"
371,00:22:49.21,00:22:49.21,kept in the dark. >> What else is new?
372,00:22:52.12,00:22:52.12,">> Uh, I was told not to tell. Is that going to be okay?"

374,00:22:58.71,00:22:58.71,"I think it's enough. I mean, I'm not seven, and"
375,00:23:01.33,00:23:01.33,that's how I'm being treated. >> How could I make you
376,00:23:04.08,00:23:04.08,feel better? >> (scoffs) Give me a

378,00:23:07.25,00:23:07.25,whatever. >> Okay. I'd like to burn Shambo
379,00:23:10.83,00:23:10.83,"right now just to get her out of my hair, but she's too valuable"
380,00:23:14.04,00:23:14.04,to our alliance so we're gonna keep her around and just deal
381,00:23:16.67,00:23:16.67,"with it, um, even though I think she's dangerous"
382,00:23:19.08,00:23:19.08,because she is unpredictable. You don't know what she's gonna
383,00:23:21.79,00:23:21.79,"do, but the boys assure me we can control her, so I'm, like,"
384,00:23:25.12,00:23:25.12,"""All right. Time will tell."" >> It makes people worry"
385,00:23:33.46,00:23:33.46,"that you will flip out, okay? >> That's-that's fair."
386,00:23:35.75,00:23:35.75,"But you know what? >> All right? They're, they're"

420,00:25:20.92,00:25:20.92,Halfway through. Getting closer to the chicken.
421,00:25:26.17,00:25:26.17,But I don't think I can win this game and knock Apollo
422,00:25:29.58,00:25:29.58,Creed out until I've caught that chicken.

426,00:26:01.62,00:26:01.62,the chicken. I'm gonna take the
427,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,fishing net. I'm gonna put it on four

429,00:26:15.62,00:26:15.62,"it to a branch up top, put some fishing line on that, and it"
430,00:26:20.46,00:26:20.46,"will be a giant, like, tent. Put some coconuts, some trash,"
431,00:26:24.00,00:26:24.00,"some bugs as kind of like bait. All right, you locked in?"
432,00:26:26.79,00:26:26.79,">> Yup. >> All right, let go."

445,00:27:23.21,00:27:23.21,feeling that I've had in probably three weeks was to hold

447,00:27:28.92,00:27:28.92,"I needed it, and it was, it was a good moment."

453,00:27:45.42,00:27:45.42,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: Erik returned home
454,00:27:47.46,00:27:47.46,to great news. >> I'm so happy!
455,00:27:52.42,00:27:52.42,>> Oh... >> Ah!
456,00:27:57.12,00:27:57.12,"Yes! Finally, the trap I set, devised"
457,00:28:01.21,00:28:01.21,"worked like a charm, and now that chicken that I stalked,"
458,00:28:05.46,00:28:05.46,"that in return mocked me for ten, 12 days-- finally, back"
459,00:28:09.08,00:28:09.08,"where it belongs in that coop. >> Yeah, I got to admit, I had"
460,00:28:12.08,00:28:12.08,"my doubts on the trap, but... >> Dude!"
461,00:28:15.21,00:28:15.21,">> There's two chickens in the freaking coop again, bro."

466,00:28:42.12,00:28:42.12,each other's throat. I decided to open the hatch so
467,00:28:51.04,00:28:51.04,"the chickens could get out, because when they're gone"
468,00:28:54.42,00:28:54.42,"tomorrow, all hell's gonna break loose."
469,00:28:57.42,00:28:57.42,It's gonna cause chaos once again.

471,00:29:04.08,00:29:04.08,(Russell laughs) He was so excited.
472,00:29:09.08,00:29:09.08,(Russell laughs) Let's see how he feels when they
473,00:29:11.62,00:29:11.62,"lose two chickens. You know, I want to have a"
474,00:29:18.21,00:29:18.21,"little bit of fun tonight, so I get up, and I put the idol"
475,00:29:21.83,00:29:21.83,around my neck. I start looking at everybody

477,00:29:28.17,00:29:28.17,"I live on the edge. All of a sudden, I see Dave's"

558,00:34:01.21,00:34:01.21,She was older? >> Donna was older.
559,00:34:03.04,00:34:03.04,She went through radiation and chemotherapy for a long time
560,00:34:05.92,00:34:05.92,and then they told her that she was fine and there was no
561,00:34:08.17,00:34:08.17,traces of cancer. She was a newlywed when the
562,00:34:11.46,00:34:11.46,"cancer was found. >> Oh, you're kidding."
563,00:34:13.50,00:34:13.50,">> She'd only been married, like, 18 months."
564,00:34:15.17,00:34:15.17,And then she went in for a scan and they said it was full-blown
565,00:34:17.54,00:34:17.54,back. >> Oh.
566,00:34:26.88,00:34:26.88,"Oh, Shammy. >> I knew at some point I was"
567,00:34:31.46,00:34:31.46,just going to break down bawling.
568,00:34:37.33,00:34:37.33,">> She's really proud of you, Sham."
569,00:34:43.08,00:34:43.08,Guarantee you that one thing. How old were you?
570,00:34:49.83,00:34:49.83,">> I was 23. I was stationed in Okinawa, and"
571,00:34:51.75,00:34:51.75,"I remember my staff sergeant saying, ""Corporal Waters go"
572,00:34:57.42,00:34:57.42,"back to the barracks, you got an emergency phone call from"
573,00:34:59.71,00:34:59.71,"the Red Cross."" And I just started bawling."
574,00:35:03.75,00:35:03.75,I was like God dang it. Who died?
575,00:35:07.04,00:35:07.04,Because I didn't know. >> Come on.
576,00:35:15.92,00:35:15.92,Where's our sunshine? >> Laura and I did not have a
577,00:35:20.96,00:35:20.96,heart-to-heart conversation. Laura invaded a private moment
578,00:35:24.50,00:35:24.50,that I was having on the beach where I was really homesick.
579,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"I was missing my family, and I started think thinking about my"
580,00:35:31.25,00:35:31.25,sister that passed away over 20 years ago.
581,00:35:33.67,00:35:33.67,"I was just, I was pretty much broken down and sad, and she"
582,00:35:36.54,00:35:36.54,wanted to play buddy-buddy with me.
583,00:35:40.21,00:35:40.21,"And her little ""reach out and touch me"" superficial bull..."
584,00:35:44.17,00:35:44.17,>> Be thankful that you're here. We have 20 more days.
585,00:35:47.88,00:35:47.88,>> I feel like the girls out here are out to get me.
586,00:35:51.00,00:35:51.00,">> Well I think you're a lot-- you're self-paranoid, too."
587,00:35:53.54,00:35:53.54,"I think the more paranoid you are, the worse it gets."
588,00:35:56.96,00:35:56.96,">> I don't think I'm paranoid, though, Lolo, I don't."
589,00:36:01.04,00:36:01.04,">> I'm telling you, you are. Don't work yourself up into"
590,00:36:03.75,00:36:03.75,something that's not there. >> I can't stand Laura.
591,00:36:06.46,00:36:06.46,I want no conversations with her.
592,00:36:09.17,00:36:09.17,"You don't even like me, and you want to sit here and pretend"
593,00:36:12.04,00:36:12.04,"like you're befriending me. It's just, like don't make me"
594,00:36:15.17,00:36:15.17,"throw up on your face. >> PROBST: On day 27, Russell"
595,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67,"believed he had it all under control, so he began to make"
596,00:36:32.88,00:36:32.88,moves to ensure his safety further in the game.
597,00:36:36.17,00:36:36.17,>> I'm in control of this game. Everything has worked for me so
598,00:36:39.33,00:36:39.33,"far. I set up my alliance so strong,"
599,00:36:42.71,00:36:42.71,"my four people, including me, they come up to me."
600,00:36:45.29,00:36:45.29,They tell me everything. And you have to be able to
601,00:36:48.79,00:36:48.79,"outwit them, even if it's your best alliance."
602,00:36:50.42,00:36:50.42,"You have to be able to outwit them, too."
603,00:36:53.58,00:36:53.58,"They're going to turn on you, Foa Foa."
604,00:36:56.71,00:36:56.71,Believe it when I say it. I'm the one that's going to
605,00:36:59.92,00:36:59.92,take you. They'll get rid of you.
606,00:37:03.92,00:37:03.92,Yeah. Who do you think's going to be
607,00:37:06.12,00:37:06.12,gone first? >> It feels really good to be
608,00:37:24.29,00:37:24.29,"aligned with Russell. I mean, he is the most powerful"
609,00:37:28.00,00:37:28.00,"player in this game. He knows that whatever he votes,"
610,00:37:31.83,00:37:31.83,"I vote, too. So really he's got two votes no"
611,00:37:34.33,00:37:34.33,"matter what, any way he wants to play it."
612,00:37:37.00,00:37:37.00,"It may, you know, mess me up in the end, but I've made it this"
613,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"far, so, you know, I'm just going to trust him, and we'll go"
614,00:37:44.71,00:37:44.71,"with it, and I'm hoping that I'll be in the final two."
615,00:37:47.67,00:37:47.67,">> Now, I want to you promise me one thing I'll never ask you"
616,00:37:50.38,00:37:50.38,again. >> Okay.
617,00:37:52.38,00:37:52.38,">> When it comes down to brass knuckles, and it's just me and"
618,00:37:55.96,00:37:55.96,"you and somebody else, you have to swear to me you ain't going"
619,00:37:59.21,00:37:59.21,to think that I'm going to beat you because I played the game
620,00:38:01.88,00:38:01.88,better and vote me off. Swear on Mick.
621,00:38:03.92,00:38:03.92,You're going to start thinking. That's a lot of money.
622,00:38:06.00,00:38:06.00,Your brain's going to start working.
623,00:38:13.17,00:38:13.17,>> It's... You know what? It's not worth the money to me
624,00:38:15.71,00:38:15.71,"to lose my integrity out here. If I give you my word, I give"
625,00:38:19.25,00:38:19.25,"you my word, and that's the bottom line."
626,00:38:21.67,00:38:21.67,">> All right. You know, it all comes to a head"
627,00:38:24.29,00:38:24.29,"sooner or later. >> For sure, I agree."
628,00:38:26.29,00:38:26.29,>> I would think my best partner out here would be Natalie.
629,00:38:29.54,00:38:29.54,"You see, Natalie is my ticket to get rid of both Jaison and Mick."
630,00:38:34.67,00:38:34.67,"So she can go pretty far in this game with me, maybe all the way"
631,00:38:38.25,00:38:38.25,to the final two. 'Cause who better to take?
632,00:38:40.04,00:38:40.04,There's no way she can beat me in votes.
633,00:38:42.62,00:38:42.62,She followed and did everything I told her to do.
634,00:38:44.67,00:38:44.67,She wouldn't even know how to talk.
635,00:38:46.67,00:38:46.67,"She might even say, ""Oh, he's right."
636,00:38:48.67,00:38:48.67,"Give it all to him."" You know, she's so sweet, I love"
637,00:38:51.08,00:38:51.08,"it. >> PROBST: With Kelly voted out,"
638,00:38:57.25,00:38:57.25,the original Galu members were grasping at anything to stop
639,00:39:01.17,00:39:01.17,their freefall. >> I just wish there was a way
640,00:39:03.17,00:39:03.17,that Kelly were here so we could keep Galu together.
641,00:39:06.12,00:39:06.12,">> Well, it's not reality. >> I know. I know, I know."
642,00:39:08.21,00:39:08.21,>> That's not where we find ourselves.
643,00:39:10.25,00:39:10.25,">> The game freaking changes. >> Well, the game changes every"
644,00:39:12.79,00:39:12.79,"day, but... >> Yeah."
645,00:39:14.88,00:39:14.88,">> Sit down, Mon. >> I feel like from my best"
646,00:39:17.17,00:39:17.17,"position right now, the best thing is to just wait it out and"
647,00:39:19.75,00:39:19.75,stick with Galu. You know what I'm saying?
648,00:39:21.79,00:39:21.79,">> Is there a Galu since Erik got blindsided, to you,"
649,00:39:25.25,00:39:25.25,"personally, in the real freaking world to be true?"
650,00:39:28.25,00:39:28.25,>> I just don't know that I can trust anybody from Foa Foa...
651,00:39:30.88,00:39:30.88,>> Listen to me. >> Uh-huh.
652,00:39:32.88,00:39:32.88,>> Don't lower your brows like I just attacked you.
653,00:39:35.62,00:39:35.62,"Drop the bull about Galu loyalty, 'cause there is none."
654,00:39:41.08,00:39:41.08,"It's Puff the Magic Freaking Dragon, okay?"
655,00:39:44.04,00:39:44.04,">> But why, Shambo? >> That's a pipe dream."
656,00:39:46.04,00:39:46.04,>> Why? Why does it have to be that way?
657,00:39:48.83,00:39:48.83,">> Because you guys chose to vote for Galu before Foa Foa,"
658,00:39:51.17,00:39:51.17,and it broke. >> But it was different.
659,00:39:53.12,00:39:53.12,>> It's... >> He was turning his back...
660,00:39:55.17,00:39:55.17,>> It always is. >> ...on Galu.
661,00:39:57.17,00:39:57.17,">> It always is because it's Survivor, yes?"
662,00:39:59.04,00:39:59.04,">> That was different, though. >> It doesn't matter who it was"
663,00:40:01.33,00:40:01.33,or why it was. >> Right.
664,00:40:03.29,00:40:03.29,>> Purple is broken. Erik helped us win every single
665,00:40:06.67,00:40:06.67,solitary challenge that we won. He was...
666,00:40:08.71,00:40:08.71,>> Because it helped himself. He was fake purple.
667,00:40:10.71,00:40:10.71,>> Then Kelly's fake purple for having a knife in my back.
668,00:40:13.75,00:40:13.75,"And why was there conversations had, lead by Laura, to get rid"
669,00:40:18.08,00:40:18.08,of Shambo? That's fake purple.
670,00:40:20.08,00:40:20.08,So don't talk to me about fake purple.
671,00:40:22.67,00:40:22.67,"Purple is fake. There is no fake, there is no"
672,00:40:25.25,00:40:25.25,real. It's Survivor.
673,00:40:27.21,00:40:27.21,>> Yeah. (thunder rumbling)
674,00:40:29.88,00:40:29.88,">> PROBST: That night in Tribal Council, the remaining Foa Foa"
675,00:40:32.92,00:40:32.92,tribe and Shambo declared victory.
676,00:40:36.33,00:40:36.33,"Ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury, Laura."
677,00:40:39.88,00:40:39.88,">> Oh, my gosh. The day of reckoning has come."
678,00:40:45.75,00:40:45.75,"Laura is gone. Now, it's an individual game."
679,00:40:49.17,00:40:49.17,And I'm not sure what's going to happen.
680,00:41:01.46,00:41:01.46,>> PROBST: Nine castaways are left.
681,00:41:03.46,00:41:03.46,>> I'm here to win the million dollars for myself.
682,00:41:06.12,00:41:06.12,>> PROBST: As the stakes get higher...
683,00:41:08.17,00:41:08.17,I hope you think it was worth it.
684,00:41:10.46,00:41:10.46,>> ALL: Oh! >> PROBST: ...which alliances
685,00:41:12.46,00:41:12.46,"will hold true? >> Russell is Russell, so we got"
686,00:41:14.50,00:41:14.50,to watch out. >> Why would you do something
687,00:41:16.46,00:41:16.46,stupid like that? >> I did not... I didn't do
688,00:41:18.46,00:41:18.46,that! >> PROBST: What sacrifices will
689,00:41:20.29,00:41:20.29,"the castaways be forced to make? >> If this goes bad, I mean, I"
690,00:41:22.17,00:41:22.17,owe you big time. >> PROBST: Can old Galu reunite
691,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,its force? >> The writing's on the wall.
692,00:41:25.96,00:41:25.96,>> PROBST: And can anyone stop Russell?
693,00:41:27.75,00:41:27.75,>> I'm going to write a book on how to win Survivor.
694,00:41:30.04,00:41:30.04,>> PROBST: Join us next week as the adventure continues.
695,00:41:42.38,00:41:42.38,>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
696,00:41:47.67,00:41:47.67,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor-- Russell and John
697,00:41:49.62,00:41:49.62,make a move. >> PROBST: So everybody needs an
698,00:41:53.62,00:41:53.62,edge. This is a significant advantage
699,00:41:55.79,00:41:55.79,in the next immunity challenge. And Shambo thinks she has a
700,00:41:57.83,00:41:57.83,psychic vision. >> I dreamed some really crazy
701,00:41:59.79,00:41:59.79,things. I think that's God's divine
702,00:42:01.88,00:42:01.88,intervention at work. I had a dream last night we
703,00:42:03.88,00:42:03.88,voted Dave off. >> \xe2\x99\xaa It's the eye of the tiger
704,00:42:13.58,00:42:13.58,It's the thrill of the fight  \xe2\x99\xaa Rising up to the challenge
705,00:42:18.42,00:42:18.42,Of our rival \xe2\x99\xaa It's the last known survivor
