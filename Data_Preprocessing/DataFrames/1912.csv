3,00:00:07.04,00:00:07.04,"The purple tribe, Galu, won almost every encounter."
4,00:00:11.33,00:00:11.33,Galu wins immunity! By the time the two tribes
5,00:00:16.21,00:00:16.21,"merged, the yellow tribe, Foa Foa, was down to four."
6,00:00:19.29,00:00:19.29,"The old Galu had eight, and they planned to keep it that"

9,00:00:26.58,00:00:26.58,We're like savages. >> PROBST: But the old Foa Foa
10,00:00:29.38,00:00:29.38,losses sharpened their ability to strategize.
11,00:00:32.25,00:00:32.25,>> Things are about to change totally in this game.
12,00:00:35.25,00:00:35.25,I don't think they even realize it right now.
13,00:00:37.38,00:00:37.38,We're steps ahead of them. We already have our plan down.
14,00:00:39.88,00:00:39.88,>> PROBST: And the plan worked. At the next two Tribal
15,00:00:43.46,00:00:43.46,"Councils, two of the old Galu went home."
16,00:00:46.25,00:00:46.25,But the old Foa Foa paid a price-- Russell had to play his
17,00:00:50.29,00:00:50.29,hidden immunity idol. Then three game-changing
18,00:00:55.42,00:00:55.42,"events took place. One, Russell found another"
19,00:00:58.79,00:00:58.79,"hidden immunity idol. >> Oh, my God!"

25,00:01:15.58,00:01:15.58,Deal? >> Okay. That's a deal.
26,00:01:17.79,00:01:17.79,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, John changed his vote."
27,00:01:22.21,00:01:22.21,The ninth person voted out and the third member of our jury.
28,00:01:25.25,00:01:25.25,And Laura made it three of the old Galus in a row.

30,00:01:33.58,00:01:33.58,the old Foa Foa is as good at holding on to a lead as they are
31,00:01:37.17,00:01:37.17,at getting one. Nine are left.
32,00:01:40.17,00:01:40.17,Who will be voted out tonight? (chickens clucking)
33,00:02:04.04,00:02:04.04,>> Medusa has been dethroned. Is that just hysterical?

36,00:02:18.46,00:02:18.46,The rules of Survivor say that if there is another tie after a
37,00:02:22.12,00:02:22.12,"second round of voting, the remaining members would choose"
38,00:02:25.75,00:02:25.75,rocks. One of those rocks would be of
39,00:02:28.25,00:02:28.25,"a different color, and that person would go home."
40,00:02:30.50,00:02:30.50,I'm not going to go home because of ridiculous rocks.
41,00:02:33.62,00:02:33.62,"I gave multiple, multiple explanations and multiple"

43,00:02:40.08,00:02:40.08,no dice. I had a conversation with
44,00:02:44.58,00:02:44.58,Russell in which he and I said the next person to go would be
45,00:02:48.46,00:02:48.46,"Foa Foa. So right now, I think I have a"
46,00:02:51.29,00:02:51.29,"pretty good position. What's funny is, collectively,"
47,00:02:54.42,00:02:54.42,"they made the correct move, and I made the correct move."
48,00:02:58.08,00:02:58.08,">> We all want to make it to the end, but at some point, you"
49,00:03:01.21,00:03:01.21,need to show loyalty and integrity and respect for the
50,00:03:06.08,00:03:06.08,people that you made promises to.
51,00:03:08.62,00:03:08.62,When it came down to it tonight...
52,00:03:10.62,00:03:10.62,>> Uh-huh. >> I still could not flop for
53,00:03:12.42,00:03:12.42,Laura. I definitely have come to see
54,00:03:14.71,00:03:14.71,John as little bit more as a Judas of the Galu tribe.
55,00:03:17.67,00:03:17.67,Then John has to go home. \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa

246,00:13:40.83,00:13:40.83,It was terrible at that point in the game.

259,00:15:11.08,00:15:11.08,I'm not seeing it right now. I don't know if anyone had been
260,00:15:14.62,00:15:14.62,"in here. Everything outside is disturbed,"
261,00:15:17.00,00:15:17.00,so it could be found already. It's making me wonder if Russell
262,00:15:20.71,00:15:20.71,"has the idol. I mean, he's good at finding"
263,00:15:22.54,00:15:22.54,"idols without clues, but I'm still going to make moves to"
264,00:15:25.88,00:15:25.88,advance myself in this game. Better safe than sorry.
265,00:15:28.71,00:15:28.71,I'll keep looking. (chickens clucking)
266,00:15:44.42,00:15:44.42,">> We're going to have to have you guys for lunch today, and I"

269,00:15:53.71,00:15:53.71,"when I go to Heaven, okay? Bye, chickens."
270,00:15:59.79,00:15:59.79,The chickens were probably my single source of happiness the

273,00:16:13.08,00:16:13.08,I'll start bawling because I'm really attached to those
274,00:16:15.71,00:16:15.71,chickens. We'd have conversations and I'd
275,00:16:18.62,00:16:18.62,"tell them, ""I really need you guys to lay me some eggs because"
276,00:16:21.62,00:16:21.62,"all these people want to kill you."""
277,00:16:24.04,00:16:24.04,And they'd go... (squawks)
278,00:16:26.54,00:16:26.54,...like they understood and they knew exactly what I was saying.
279,00:16:29.33,00:16:29.33,(chickens clucking) I think that I brought them as
280,00:16:33.04,00:16:33.04,"much peace as they brought me, and it was a win-win."
281,00:16:40.04,00:16:40.04,"Then... off with their heads. (chickens clucking, Russell"

284,00:16:56.04,00:16:56.04,>> That actually wasn't so bad. >> Mm-mm.
285,00:16:58.08,00:16:58.08,>> Tell me when the chickens stop screaming.
286,00:17:09.42,00:17:09.42,"What I'm going to do is I'm gonna part the chickens out, and"
287,00:17:14.04,00:17:14.04,I'm going to boil them in a little bit of salt water and a
288,00:17:16.42,00:17:16.42,lot of fresh water. >> Mm-hmm.
289,00:17:18.25,00:17:18.25,>> Can we rotisserie at least one?
290,00:17:19.96,00:17:19.96,"So we can get some, like... >> No, absolutely not."
291,00:17:21.58,00:17:21.58,>> Why? >> Because you'll lose 65%
292,00:17:24.88,00:17:24.88,yield. I'll take care of the cooking
293,00:17:27.17,00:17:27.17,"because I might not know a lot about a lot of things, but when"
294,00:17:29.50,00:17:29.50,"it comes to cooking... that's time to say ""shut up"" if you're"
295,00:17:35.21,00:17:35.21,me. >> I think most people just want
296,00:17:38.46,00:17:38.46,"to skewer the chicken and put it over the fire, but Shambo, being"
297,00:17:41.12,00:17:41.12,"the chef and all that, is going to, like, want to do something"
298,00:17:44.38,00:17:44.38,"crazy, and so I-- you know, we don't even care so long as we're"
299,00:17:47.04,00:17:47.04,eating chicken today. So I think that's the plan
300,00:17:50.67,00:17:50.67,unless somebody decides to veto it later.
301,00:18:01.12,00:18:01.12,>> How's that chicken coming? >> About another hour and a
302,00:18:04.17,00:18:04.17,half. (Dave whistles)
303,00:18:08.04,00:18:08.04,">> Yeah, um, that's a hard boil. >> Yeah, we're not having a"

305,00:18:14.33,00:18:14.33,"no mood, so just trust me. We'll just call it a bad case of"
306,00:18:17.71,00:18:17.71,"PMS, but I'm really in no mood to talk about the soup today."
307,00:18:21.25,00:18:21.25,">> I won those chickens, Shambo, so I think I should be able to"

327,00:19:51.67,00:19:51.67,intervention at work. I don't know what makes me think
328,00:19:53.88,00:19:53.88,"that. I just-- it's-- I really, truly"
329,00:19:57.04,00:19:57.04,"believe that. I think that's what it is, I"
330,00:20:00.08,00:20:00.08,"really do, and I had a dream last night we voted Dave off."
331,00:20:04.79,00:20:04.79,(chickens clucking) Dave is the first to go.
332,00:20:13.88,00:20:13.88,">> Set in stone, set in stone. >> Set in freaking stone."
333,00:20:17.75,00:20:17.75,Deal? >> Deal.

337,00:20:31.17,00:20:31.17,(laughs) So she has her dreams who she's
338,00:20:35.17,00:20:35.17,"voting off, and then that's who it has to be."
339,00:20:39.54,00:20:39.54,We've got somebody unstable like Shambo.
340,00:20:41.83,00:20:41.83,All she votes with is her emotions.

375,00:22:55.96,00:22:55.96,"of rope, you are going to feel it."
376,00:22:58.29,00:22:58.29,These logs weigh as much as you do.
377,00:23:03.29,00:23:03.29,This challenge is on. (rope creaking)
378,00:23:09.21,00:23:09.21,"Every three minutes, you'll switch to the other hand."
379,00:23:12.88,00:23:12.88,You will only have one hand on this rope at any given time.
380,00:23:18.88,00:23:18.88,"All right, everybody place your left hand on the second position"
381,00:23:21.21,00:23:21.21,on the rope. Get a good grip and release
382,00:23:25.33,00:23:25.33,your right hand. Hot day to be sitting out in the
383,00:23:31.08,00:23:31.08,"sun holding on to a heavy log. All right, everybody put your"
384,00:23:41.92,00:23:41.92,left hand on the fourth position on the knot.
385,00:23:45.21,00:23:45.21,>> Now I'm using both. >> PROBST: Jaison using his two
386,00:23:47.75,00:23:47.75,spots right now. Jaison is now only on the second
387,00:23:50.42,00:23:50.42,knot. Everybody else is on the fourth
388,00:23:53.21,00:23:53.21,knot. Jaison used that move very early
389,00:23:56.12,00:23:56.12,in this challenge. See if it pays off.
390,00:24:26.17,00:24:26.17,"All right, everybody, it is time to move further down on the"
391,00:24:29.42,00:24:29.42,"rope. Three, two, one."
392,00:24:33.25,00:24:33.25,Release. Now the log's going to begin to
393,00:24:38.08,00:24:38.08,get heavy. Shambo trying to hold on.
394,00:24:44.67,00:24:44.67,(glass breaking) >> Oh!
395,00:24:46.67,00:24:46.67,>> PROBST: Shambo. The log and Shambo take a
396,00:24:49.12,00:24:49.12,"tumble. Shambo, first person out of this"
397,00:24:51.21,00:24:51.21,challenge. You all right?
398,00:24:53.21,00:24:53.21,>> I'm good to go. (glass breaking)
399,00:24:57.75,00:24:57.75,">> PROBST: Russell, surprisingly drops out."
400,00:25:00.04,00:25:00.04,What happened? >> I got a charley horse in my
401,00:25:02.83,00:25:02.83,"forearm, and that was it. >> PROBST: All right, everybody,"
402,00:25:06.29,00:25:06.29,it is time to make the last move.
403,00:25:08.92,00:25:08.92,"Switch hands. Three, two, one."
404,00:25:12.50,00:25:12.50,And release. You have no knot now to give
405,00:25:17.50,00:25:17.50,you any kind of leverage or any kind of grip.
406,00:25:20.12,00:25:20.12,Now this rope can slip through your hands a lot more easily.
407,00:25:24.04,00:25:24.04,"Jaison, on the other hand, does have a knot to hold on to, and"
408,00:25:28.04,00:25:28.04,now will never feel all of the weight of this log.

410,00:25:37.33,00:25:37.33,"Monica drops her log. >> All right, go ahead, boys."
411,00:25:40.79,00:25:40.79,(glass breaking) >> PROBST: John's had enough.
412,00:25:43.58,00:25:43.58,He steps out of the challenge. (glass breaking)
413,00:25:52.46,00:25:52.46,Brett cannot hold on any longer. Brett is out of the challenge.
414,00:25:55.75,00:25:55.75,"We are down to four-- Jaison, Dave, Mick and Natalie."
415,00:26:02.12,00:26:02.12,"I have to say, Natalie, you've got to be the surprise of this"
416,00:26:04.79,00:26:04.79,challenge right now. (glass breaking)
417,00:26:08.21,00:26:08.21,Mick drops out of the challenge. We are down to three.
418,00:26:12.79,00:26:12.79,"We have two former Foa Foa, one former Galu."
419,00:26:17.46,00:26:17.46,Everybody doing a good job of digging deep.
420,00:26:21.12,00:26:21.12,Keep digging. You have more in there.
421,00:26:24.21,00:26:24.21,You never know when it's your turn to go.
422,00:26:28.12,00:26:28.12,You don't want it to be tonight. (Jaison exhales loudly)
423,00:26:32.96,00:26:32.96,(rope creaking) That hand better be bleeding
424,00:26:35.21,00:26:35.21,when you let go. (glass breaking)
425,00:26:39.96,00:26:39.96,Natalie cannot hang in there any longer.
426,00:26:42.08,00:26:42.08,>> Darn. >> PROBST: Great effort.
427,00:26:44.08,00:26:44.08,"Natalie out of the challenge. And we are down to two, side by"
428,00:26:47.08,00:26:47.08,side-- Jaison and Dave for immunity.
429,00:26:52.04,00:26:52.04,Jaison has a two-knot advantage. Dave Ball is holding on to rope
430,00:26:57.25,00:26:57.25,with no knot. It could easily slip through his
431,00:26:59.88,00:26:59.88,hands. (rope creaking)

438,00:27:25.38,00:27:25.38,(glass breaking) >> Yeah.
439,00:27:27.42,00:27:27.42,>> Good job. >> When Dave's hand slipped and
440,00:27:30.38,00:27:30.38,"the plate broke, it was like heaven."
441,00:27:32.38,00:27:32.38,"I mean, I'm not sure I would have beaten Dave without that"
442,00:27:34.17,00:27:34.17,"advantage. Shambo wants him gone, and the"

444,00:27:37.79,00:27:37.79,with Shambo. I just want to focus and
445,00:27:39.58,00:27:39.58,execute. We've got to get Dave tonight.
446,00:27:41.38,00:27:41.38,">> PROBST: Jaison, come on over. >> Victory!"
447,00:27:43.38,00:27:43.38,">> Good job, Jaison. >> Yay, Jaison!"
448,00:27:45.38,00:27:45.38,>> Finally won something. >> Finally you won!

450,00:27:49.38,00:27:49.38,">> PROBST: Well, you passed up chicken."
451,00:27:51.17,00:27:51.17,">> It cost me food and money, yeah."
452,00:27:53.21,00:27:53.21,">> PROBST: You passed up cheeseburger, but while"
453,00:27:55.21,00:27:55.21,"everybody else has a full belly, you have something much more"
454,00:27:58.54,00:27:58.54,valuable-- safety at tonight's Tribal Council.
455,00:28:01.92,00:28:01.92,"Jaison cannot be voted out. As for the rest of you, after 30"
456,00:28:05.17,00:28:05.17,"days out here, one of you going home tonight."

458,00:28:09.96,00:28:09.96,I will see you at Tribal. >> I am definitely in a position
459,00:28:13.71,00:28:13.71,of power with Foa Foa at my disposal to vote how I ask them
460,00:28:18.46,00:28:18.46,"to. And they keep saying, ""Shannon,"
461,00:28:20.71,00:28:20.71,"whatever you want."" Dave is so gone, he doesn't even"
462,00:28:23.17,00:28:23.17,"know it. >> Man, good job today."
463,00:28:41.04,00:28:41.04,">> Dave, good work. You almost beat me, and you had"
464,00:28:43.04,00:28:43.04,no knot. That's incredible.
465,00:28:45.08,00:28:45.08,">> You beat me fair and square, bro."
466,00:28:47.08,00:28:47.08,">> Hey, awesome. >> Well, I had..."
467,00:28:49.04,00:28:49.04,">> Hey, you, too. Good job. >> That was good."

470,00:28:54.79,00:28:54.79,>> Dave made a few comments to Shambo about the chicken and how
471,00:28:58.12,00:28:58.12,"to cook it and stuff, and she was furious, and, you know, when"
472,00:29:00.12,00:29:00.12,"she gets sort of angry at somebody, that's who she wants"
473,00:29:02.08,00:29:02.08,"voted off, but at this point, we kind of count on Shambo's votes,"
474,00:29:06.00,00:29:06.00,so it's going to be Dave. >> Thank you.
475,00:29:11.25,00:29:11.25,"I'm bummed I lost, but, oh, well."
476,00:29:13.25,00:29:13.25,">> It was nice, man. >> You and me finally won"
477,00:29:15.04,00:29:15.04,"something, huh? Back to back. >> I know, look at that."
478,00:29:17.04,00:29:17.04,>> I know... >> C'est la vie.
479,00:29:19.67,00:29:19.67,C'est la vie. >> No way. No way.
480,00:29:42.33,00:29:42.33,">> Clearly, Galu is running scared."
481,00:29:45.50,00:29:45.50,">> Right. >> The next vote, I can get them"
482,00:29:48.50,00:29:48.50,to vote off someone from Foa Foa.
483,00:29:50.54,00:29:50.54,>> Right. >> You already said you were
484,00:29:52.58,00:29:52.58,cool with that. >> Right.
485,00:29:54.58,00:29:54.58,">> So I think we just lay low, we hang out, not a lot..."
486,00:29:56.83,00:29:56.83,">> So, right now, just, uh, I guess we're thinking Mick right"
487,00:29:59.96,00:29:59.96,"now. >> I mean, I think... I think"
488,00:30:01.96,00:30:01.96,"so, man. >> It might be the best option,"
489,00:30:03.96,00:30:03.96,"uh, both ways, yeah. >> And then we continue to move"
490,00:30:06.38,00:30:06.38,on and move on and move on and move on through this game and
491,00:30:09.42,00:30:09.42,progress further and further. >> Right.
492,00:30:11.42,00:30:11.42,">> And if something crazy happens, because you have ears"
493,00:30:13.83,00:30:13.83,"here and I have ears there... >> Yeah, I'll let you know."
494,00:30:17.25,00:30:17.25,">> If we are... If we do find ourselves outgunned, we can see"
495,00:30:20.38,00:30:20.38,it coming... >> Right.
496,00:30:22.38,00:30:22.38,">> ...we play the idol, and then we're done."
497,00:30:29.12,00:30:29.12,>> You have it. I'm 100% sure...
498,00:30:31.12,00:30:31.12,>> Where-Where... Where'd you look?
499,00:30:33.12,00:30:33.12,">> Uh... well, I... >> Tell me where the clue was,"
500,00:30:35.17,00:30:35.17,"and I'll tell you, I'll give you a hint."
501,00:30:37.17,00:30:37.17,">> What do you mean? >> Tell me where the clue was,"
502,00:30:39.21,00:30:39.21,and I'll tell you where the idol is.
503,00:30:42.33,00:30:42.33,"At first, we were thinking, get rid of Dave."
504,00:30:44.33,00:30:44.33,Everybody's on board to get rid of Dave.
505,00:30:46.54,00:30:46.54,It was in the wall 'cause it didn't roll off.
506,00:30:48.54,00:30:48.54,">> Yeah. Right, right. >> So, it was sitting inside."
507,00:30:50.54,00:30:50.54,">> Yeah, exactly. >> In the meantime, probably the"
508,00:30:53.21,00:30:53.21,best move would be to get rid of John.
509,00:30:55.33,00:30:55.33,"He's a threat strategically, and, uh... and I told him that I"
510,00:30:59.67,00:30:59.67,"had the immunity idol. And I go, ""Good for me..."""
511,00:31:06.54,00:31:06.54,">> Right. >> ""...if anyone has it, 'cause"
512,00:31:08.54,00:31:08.54,I thought about the numbers.' >> I knew he knew I had it.
513,00:31:10.83,00:31:10.83,"So he said, ""I know you have it."""
514,00:31:12.79,00:31:12.79,"So I didn't want to sit there-- ""No, I don't, no, I don't."""
515,00:31:14.79,00:31:14.79,"So I said, ""Yeah, I have it, and it can help us."""
516,00:31:18.17,00:31:18.17,"So now, I have to get rid of John."
517,00:31:20.21,00:31:20.21,>> As long as you give me your word that you're not voting for
518,00:31:22.00,00:31:22.00,"me, we're both here after the vote, we can continue to work..."
519,00:31:23.83,00:31:23.83,>> Right. These poor people need to close
520,00:31:25.83,00:31:25.83,"their ears when I start talking, 'cause when I tell you"
521,00:31:28.71,00:31:28.71,"something, and I made a mistake, I got to get rid of you."
522,00:31:31.08,00:31:31.08,"It was my mistake, but, sorry, John, you've got to go home for"
523,00:31:33.08,00:31:33.08,"it. Sounds good to me, man, as long"
524,00:31:36.25,00:31:36.25,"as, uh, we stick together... >> I mean, you're not going to"
525,00:31:38.29,00:31:38.29,"burn me the next vote, I'm not gonna burn you the next vote."
526,00:31:40.33,00:31:40.33,"I'm mean, we're rolling. >> Yeah, as long as we stick"
527,00:31:42.38,00:31:42.38,"together, then we can do this, the whole way through."
528,00:31:44.38,00:31:44.38,">> So we're fine. >> All right, cool."
529,00:31:51.04,00:31:51.04,I can save you tonight. It would be you.
530,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,>> It would be me? >> It would definitely.
531,00:31:55.04,00:31:55.04,">> I had a feeling. >> Now, it's going to be Shambo,"
532,00:31:58.83,00:31:58.83,and the whole Foa Foa tribe. >> Mm-hmm.
533,00:32:00.92,00:32:00.92,>> That's whose the vote is. >> Okay.
534,00:32:04.12,00:32:04.12,>> I think the best way to do this is get rid of John tonight.
535,00:32:08.25,00:32:08.25,And there's no reason I would be lying about this...
536,00:32:10.79,00:32:10.79,>> Mm. >> ...because why would I come
537,00:32:12.50,00:32:12.50,"to you saying, I want to get rid of him when your name's in the"
538,00:32:15.33,00:32:15.33,"sling right now? >> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
539,00:32:17.33,00:32:17.33,>> Is-Is Monica close to John? Can you tell her without her
540,00:32:22.21,00:32:22.21,going to John and saying anything?
541,00:32:24.21,00:32:24.21,>> I could probably say something to her.
542,00:32:26.21,00:32:26.21,">> All right. >> Uh, yeah, yeah, well, you"
543,00:32:28.21,00:32:28.21,"know what, is-- I mean, after he, uh, flipped on Laura, a"
544,00:32:30.67,00:32:30.67,"matter of frigging time. You know, nobody trusts him"
545,00:32:32.67,00:32:32.67,anymore. >> It will be you if it's not
546,00:32:34.67,00:32:34.67,John. I want you to stay in the game.
547,00:32:39.54,00:32:39.54,">> All right. Because I almost won it today,"
548,00:32:42.25,00:32:42.25,huh? >> That was pretty impressive.
549,00:32:44.46,00:32:44.46,>> All right. >> I don't want them to see me
550,00:32:46.92,00:32:46.92,talking to you too much. >> All right.
551,00:32:49.17,00:32:49.17,"All right, brother. >> All right, man."
552,00:32:51.17,00:32:51.17,>> All right. >> If you had a choice to get
553,00:33:01.08,00:33:01.08,"rid of anybody in this game right now, who would it be?"
554,00:33:04.12,00:33:04.12,>> John. >> He is dangerous.
555,00:33:08.67,00:33:08.67,">> Most dangerous person here. >> With him gone, things would"
556,00:33:12.92,00:33:12.92,"be... we could run it down. >> Oh, dude, it'd be cake."
557,00:33:15.83,00:33:15.83,>> Dave is way too scared right now to not make this deal.
558,00:33:20.21,00:33:20.21,Way too scared. We just talked for about 30

560,00:33:25.12,00:33:25.12,"I don't know, what do you think, man?"
561,00:33:27.42,00:33:27.42,I think we try John. >> I think we get rid of John.
562,00:33:30.25,00:33:30.25,>> What happens next week with Dave gone?
563,00:33:32.12,00:33:32.12,What is Shambo going to do? We don't know.
564,00:33:34.42,00:33:34.42,"Dude, I don't trust them. I don't trust them at all."
565,00:33:38.08,00:33:38.08,"All right, so you really believe this."
566,00:33:40.25,00:33:40.25,">> Dude, it's real... this is gonna happen."
567,00:33:42.04,00:33:42.04,">> Okay, all right. >> For sure."
568,00:33:43.50,00:33:43.50,>> All right. >> John.
569,00:33:53.33,00:33:53.33,">> So, basically, Russell and I started talking, and he's, like,"

571,00:33:58.17,00:33:58.17,"right now?"" Clearly, I said, John."

575,00:34:15.00,00:34:15.00,"But next round's gonna be a four-four tie, 'cause Shambo's"
576,00:34:17.46,00:34:17.46,gonna leave us in two seconds. Taking her for granted.
577,00:34:23.96,00:34:23.96,You're telling me you really agree with this?
578,00:34:26.25,00:34:26.25,>> This may be one of our only shots to get rid of John.
579,00:34:28.83,00:34:28.83,">> Why? >> Nothing's for sure, but it"
580,00:34:30.88,00:34:30.88,just seems like we do have the numbers.
581,00:34:32.75,00:34:32.75,">> You get rid of John and you piss off Shambo, and she's"
582,00:34:35.25,00:34:35.25,"gonna go to the other side, and then we're gonna have to"
583,00:34:37.46,00:34:37.46,draw rocks. >> I believe that Russell can
584,00:34:41.88,00:34:41.88,settle Shambo. >> After leaving her out there
585,00:34:44.17,00:34:44.17,hanging the same way Galu did? Exactly the same way?

593,00:35:38.67,00:35:38.67,mean anything to me. As long as I got a victory.

604,00:36:13.12,00:36:13.12,"days, but today was peaceful. It wasn't about game play so"
605,00:36:17.42,00:36:17.42,"much, and it was genuine. >> To me, today was strategic"
606,00:36:21.21,00:36:21.21,"only, completely strategic. >> Wow."

616,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,pretty clear. Where do you think you sit in

618,00:37:02.88,00:37:02.88,as honest and kind as I can with Shambo.
619,00:37:06.17,00:37:06.17,"You know, just be a good sport about everything."

641,00:38:07.04,00:38:07.04,"I will be shocked. >> PROBST: John, what's your"
642,00:38:13.54,00:38:13.54,take on tonight's vote? >> I think that of the two
643,00:38:17.12,00:38:17.12,"potential names, you've asked both of them questions, and"
644,00:38:20.08,00:38:20.08,"they both said they wouldn't be shocked, so I think the answer"
645,00:38:22.17,00:38:22.17,"is no. >> PROBST: All right, it's time"
646,00:38:26.12,00:38:26.12,"to get to the vote. Jaison, you earned that"
647,00:38:28.21,00:38:28.21,immunity. I assume you're keeping it?
648,00:38:30.38,00:38:30.38,">> Yeah. >> PROBST: All right, you"
649,00:38:32.25,00:38:32.25,cannot vote for Jaison. Everybody else is fair game.
650,00:38:34.71,00:38:34.71,Let's see if the blindsides continue.
651,00:38:37.38,00:38:37.38,"It is time to vote. Monica, you're up."

654,00:39:26.33,00:39:26.33,because it might get me closer to a million bucks.

656,00:39:34.92,00:39:34.92,votes. If anybody has the hidden

658,00:39:48.12,00:39:48.12,"to do so. Okay. Once the votes are read,"
659,00:39:54.33,00:39:54.33,the decision is final. The person voted out will be
660,00:39:56.42,00:39:56.42,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
661,00:39:58.62,00:39:58.62,I'll read the votes. First vote...

681,00:41:58.62,00:41:58.62,"gonna bite you."" And the kid starts playing with"
682,00:42:00.29,00:42:00.29,"the snake, and the snake bites him."

686,00:42:15.46,00:42:15.46,another decision made by Galu that is a substandard decision.

688,00:42:22.04,00:42:22.04,to see tomorrow. The former Galu tribe is
689,00:42:24.75,00:42:24.75,"intellectually outmatched. I'm happy that I performed, you"
690,00:42:27.62,00:42:27.62,"know, well and made it into the fourth quarter."
