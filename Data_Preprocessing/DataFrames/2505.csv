508,00:32:46.73,00:32:46.73,VALUE IN THE CHALLENGES FOR US. DENISE IS STRONGER THAN DAWSON
509,00:32:50.57,00:32:50.57,AND KATY. I THINK SHE'S PHYSICAL AND SHE'S
510,00:32:54.40,00:32:54.40,MENTAL. I THINK SHE'S GOT SOME PRETTY
511,00:32:55.87,00:32:55.87,GOOD SMART ON HER. >> I THINK I GOT DENISE ON OUR
512,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67,SIDE. >> SHE'S WITH US THREE.
513,00:33:03.07,00:33:03.07,>> PERFECT. >> SO WE'VE GOT FOUR.

516,00:33:11.03,00:33:11.03,"AT THIS POINT. DENISE, KATY, OR DAWSON."
517,00:33:14.33,00:33:14.33,BUT I CAN'T SEE GETTING RID OF DENISE NOW.
518,00:33:17.93,00:33:17.93,SHE'S A HELL OF A COMPETITOR. SHE WAS RIGHT IN IT TO WIN IT
519,00:33:21.73,00:33:21.73,TODAY. NO WAY COULD WE POINT AT HER AND
520,00:33:23.57,00:33:23.57,SAY SHE'S THE ONE WHO CAUSED US THIS CHALLENGE.
521,00:33:25.90,00:33:25.90,"SO IT'S KATY OUR DAWSON. DAWSON, I NEED YOU TO FIND SOME"
522,00:33:30.00,00:33:30.00,MORE WOOD. >> OKAY.
523,00:33:39.30,00:33:39.30,>> ARE WE ALONE? >> BARELY ALONE.

527,00:33:56.80,00:33:56.80,AROUND THE BEACH. >> WE LOST DAWSON.
528,00:33:58.57,00:33:58.57,SHE HAD PUZZLES IN HER HAND AND YOU WERE TRYING TO GET THEM AND
529,00:34:01.87,00:34:01.87,SHE WASN'T EVEN GIVING THEM TO YOU.
530,00:34:05.83,00:34:05.83,I'M FIEWMED. >> I'M WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT.
531,00:34:07.90,00:34:07.90,I'D JUST LIKE TO-- I DON'T KNOW. KATY DID NOT PERFORM WELL TODAY.
532,00:34:13.73,00:34:13.73,SHE PERFORMED POORLY. AND I CAN'T SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT
533,00:34:17.83,00:34:17.83,COST US THE CHALLENGE. BUT IT DIDN'T HELP.
534,00:34:21.07,00:34:21.07,"BUT BEFORE TODAY, DAWSON IS JUST BEEN THE WEAKEST MEMBER OF THE"
535,00:34:25.57,00:34:25.57,TRIBE. I DON'T THINK SHE PERFORMED
536,00:34:28.63,00:34:28.63,PARTICULARLY WELL TODAY. I DON'T THINK SHE PERFORMED
537,00:34:31.90,00:34:31.90,"STAFDISASTROUSLY. IT'S A BIG CHOICE, ACTUALLY."
538,00:34:35.83,00:34:35.83,>> MAYBE I SHOULD DATE AN ATHLETE.
539,00:34:38.43,00:34:38.43,>> WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER AN ATHLETE?
540,00:34:42.93,00:34:42.93,">> FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL, THEN I GUESS AT THE END MAYBE BASEBALL."
541,00:34:48.00,00:34:48.00,"I KNOW JEFF IS FROM A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE, AND AS FAR"
542,00:34:51.00,00:34:51.00,"AS I KNOW, I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS."
543,00:34:53.37,00:34:53.37,SO I ENJOE GETTING INTO HIS MIND AND MAKING HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.
544,00:35:02.00,00:35:02.00,THERE'S TOO MUCH STANDING AROUND.
545,00:35:03.40,00:35:03.40,"IT'S, LIKE, A WHOLE BUNCH OF GROWN GUYS JUST LIKE-- IT'S A"
546,00:35:06.93,00:35:06.93,LOT OF FUN TO MAKE HIM SQUIRM. AND IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO-- I
