4,00:00:10.08,00:00:10.08,"Jalapao and Timbira, battled it out."
5,00:00:14.92,00:00:14.92,The winning tribe at each reward challenge got to send
6,00:00:18.46,00:00:18.46,someone from the losing tribe to Exile Island.
7,00:00:23.12,00:00:23.12,">> PROBST: But in a new twist... Brendan, choose one member of"
8,00:00:26.08,00:00:26.08,the winning tribe to join you at Exile Island.
9,00:00:32.12,00:00:32.12,>> PROBST: This gave the Exiles an opportunity to form a
10,00:00:35.12,00:00:35.12,cross-tribal alliance. >> We got another clue.
11,00:00:38.21,00:00:38.21,>> We got another clue! (laughing)
12,00:00:39.58,00:00:39.58,">> Perfect! >> PROBST: Which they did,"
13,00:00:41.92,00:00:41.92,sharing clues to immunity idols hidden at each of their camps.
14,00:00:48.92,00:00:48.92,>> PROBST: They made plans to strengthen their alliance by
15,00:00:51.04,00:00:51.04,"bringing in Brendan's tribemate, Sierra, and Taj's tribemate,"
16,00:00:55.00,00:00:55.00,Stephen.  >> Do you want to be a part of 
17,00:00:57.17,00:00:57.17,the biggest upset on Survivor history?
18,00:00:59.04,00:00:59.04,">> Yes, I do. >> Okay."
19,00:01:00.75,00:01:00.75,">> PROBST: But Brendan never had a chance to inform Sierra,"
20,00:01:05.12,00:01:05.12,leaving Taj to do it the next time at Exile Island.
21,00:01:08.50,00:01:08.50,">> Once we get to the merge, we'll have a four-way alliance"
22,00:01:10.83,00:01:10.83,that no one knows about and can't break up.
23,00:01:12.92,00:01:12.92,>> Awesome. >> PROBST: Taj zeroed in on the
24,00:01:16.75,00:01:16.75,whereabouts of the hidden immunity idol at Jalapao.
25,00:01:20.12,00:01:20.12,>> It's back at my home camp at tree mail.
26,00:01:22.17,00:01:22.17,>> PROBST: But she didn't have a chance to look for it.
27,00:01:26.54,00:01:26.54,However... >> Yes!
28,00:01:29.17,00:01:29.17,>> PROBST: Brendan made the discovery at Timbira.
29,00:01:32.67,00:01:32.67,At the last immunity challenge...
30,00:01:34.29,00:01:34.29,">> Oh, my God! >> PROBST: Timbira does win"
31,00:01:36.17,00:01:36.17,immunity! Timbira evened things up when
32,00:01:40.83,00:01:40.83,they forced Jalapao to lose another member.
33,00:01:43.71,00:01:43.71,"Sandy, the tribe has spoken. With the tribes dead even at"
34,00:01:48.08,00:01:48.08,"six apiece, it's anyone's game. 12 are left."
35,00:01:54.25,00:01:54.25,Who will be voted out tonight? (Taj moaning)
36,00:02:01.50,00:02:01.50,>> Just... (grunting)
37,00:02:03.17,00:02:03.17,"Yes, right there! Yes, yes!"
38,00:02:05.75,00:02:05.75,"Itchy, ooh! Ahh, yes!"
39,00:02:11.17,00:02:11.17,"Oh, my God. You're doing it, baby."
40,00:02:13.71,00:02:13.71,You are doing it. We got rid of Sandy last night.
41,00:02:17.04,00:02:17.04,"I only wrote Joe's name down on the paper at, uh, Tribal Council"
42,00:02:21.08,00:02:21.08,because I didn't want to put Sandy's name down.
43,00:02:23.25,00:02:23.25,I need to get some more water. I'm out of water.
44,00:02:25.92,00:02:25.92,">> I'll go with you. >> Yeah, we can go fill up the"
45,00:02:28.08,00:02:28.08,"bottles together. >> Right now, everything with"
46,00:02:31.67,00:02:31.67,"Brendan, Sierra, and Stephen is in place."
47,00:02:34.12,00:02:34.12,We have the Exile Island alliance intact.
48,00:02:39.21,00:02:39.21,Our main focus right now is to find the idol.
49,00:02:42.08,00:02:42.08,We're just set with the four people in place.
50,00:02:44.12,00:02:44.12,"Now, all we need is the extra ammunition and then it's on."
51,00:02:58.67,00:02:58.67,Something has to be... Something must be something.
52,00:03:03.08,00:03:03.08,"'Cause it says, ""Why the sad frown?"""
53,00:03:06.17,00:03:06.17,">> That's what it is: ""Why the sad frown?"""
54,00:03:08.08,00:03:08.08,">> That was the last clue. ""You get your mail from it"
55,00:03:10.79,00:03:10.79,"every day,"" and, uh, something ""round, and you'll ask it why"
56,00:03:15.46,00:03:15.46,"the sad frown."" >> I swear to you... Oh, my God!"
57,00:03:20.33,00:03:20.33,">> Oh, my God! I found the immunity idol,"
58,00:03:24.00,00:03:24.00,and I felt a very huge sense of relief because everything is
59,00:03:27.17,00:03:27.17,complete now. We have the foursome in place.
60,00:03:29.92,00:03:29.92,We have both the idols in place. All we have to do now is make
61,00:03:32.79,00:03:32.79,it to the merge with everybody intact.
62,00:03:35.04,00:03:35.04,"""If you intend to use the idol, you must reveal it or"
63,00:03:36.67,00:03:36.67,"give it away to someone else... the votes have been cast... """
64,00:03:39.38,00:03:39.38,All right. I just love it when a perfect
65,00:03:42.42,00:03:42.42,plan comes together. It's so much fun!
66,00:03:45.25,00:03:45.25,"(laughing) Okay, stuff this in your pocket."
67,00:03:49.79,00:03:49.79,Do something with it. Hide it.
68,00:03:51.75,00:03:51.75,>> Should we bury it or do you think I should put it in my
69,00:03:54.04,00:03:54.04,"pants? >> Um, I think we should"
70,00:03:55.67,00:03:55.67,keep it. They won't suspect you.
71,00:03:57.21,00:03:57.21,They're looking at me. >> Right.
72,00:03:58.46,00:03:58.46,">> So, keep it on you. Keep it on you close."
73,00:04:00.29,00:04:00.29,"Um, you know, if you bend down, be cognizant that something will"
74,00:04:03.29,00:04:03.29,"show, the shape of your pockets will show, so always protect"
75,00:04:05.54,00:04:05.54,yourself. Grab the bottle.
76,00:04:07.17,00:04:07.17,Let's get back. >> Taj and I found the idol
77,00:04:09.17,00:04:09.17,together and she immediately handed it off to me because
78,00:04:12.12,00:04:12.12,I was the one with pockets so I could better conceal it.
79,00:04:15.96,00:04:15.96,">> Ooh, I'm sweating. >> Oh, my God!"
80,00:04:17.58,00:04:17.58,"We got it, girl! >> I know, I know, I told you"
81,00:04:19.17,00:04:19.17,"it was going to work out. I'm telling you, once we make"
82,00:04:21.04,00:04:21.04,"it to the merge, it's smooth sailing."
83,00:04:22.33,00:04:22.33,">> I mean, I'm delighted to have it but, you know, as long"
84,00:04:24.62,00:04:24.62,"as it's in my possession, I'm going to try to keep it in my"
85,00:04:26.71,00:04:26.71,"possession. Theoretically and ostensibly,"
86,00:04:29.17,00:04:29.17,it is mine. I'm the one wearing the idol
87,00:04:31.08,00:04:31.08,around my neck. (theme song playing)

92,00:05:48.88,00:05:48.88,I gotta go down to the river and wash pots and get water and
93,00:05:51.33,00:05:51.33,"all that good stuff, so... >> Yeah, might as well get"
94,00:05:54.08,00:05:54.08,going. >> Okay.
95,00:06:00.33,00:06:00.33,">> Are you coming, Brendan? >> He's working on the fire."
96,00:06:03.04,00:06:03.04,">> Yeah, I'm going to get the fire going."

99,00:06:23.00,00:06:23.00,"you need any extra hands. >> We got it, I think."
100,00:06:25.54,00:06:25.54,Thanks. You rest. >> Okay.
101,00:06:28.33,00:06:28.33,">> So... >> Dude, you didn't tell me."
102,00:06:31.58,00:06:31.58,"I was standing there and I walk in and she's like, ""I gotta"
103,00:06:34.17,00:06:34.17,"tell you about this four-way alliance."""
104,00:06:35.75,00:06:35.75,And I was like... (laughing)
105,00:06:39.71,00:06:39.71,"I'm gonna kill you. >> Dude, but it works."
106,00:06:41.71,00:06:41.71,"All right, so... >> Were you going to tell me?"
107,00:06:43.46,00:06:43.46,You bastard. >> Yes!
108,00:06:45.54,00:06:45.54,I didn't have a chance to speak with Sierra before the
109,00:06:47.21,00:06:47.21,"challenge, so, I didn't tell her about the plan with Taj."
110,00:06:50.29,00:06:50.29,It could have been disaster. It could have blown the whole
111,00:06:52.12,00:06:52.12,thing up. >> And then she got the clue.
112,00:06:54.17,00:06:54.17,>> Yeah. >> She turned around to me and
113,00:06:55.54,00:06:55.54,she showed it to me. >> Yep.
114,00:06:58.38,00:06:58.38,"Yep, I have it. >> Every single kind of stage"
115,00:07:00.88,00:07:00.88,that we've set has worked and every time we've layered more
116,00:07:04.04,00:07:04.04,"people into the plan, you know, we've gotten more and more"
117,00:07:07.12,00:07:07.12,"powerful. Good, right?"
118,00:07:12.25,00:07:12.25,>> That four-way alliance is insane.
119,00:07:13.79,00:07:13.79,>> Perfect. >> We're going down to the end
120,00:07:15.42,00:07:15.42,"no matter what. >> Yeah, perfect."
121,00:07:16.88,00:07:16.88,Uh-huh. >> It's over.
122,00:07:19.21,00:07:19.21,"Hallelujah, praise the Lord. Amen, Jesus!"
123,00:07:22.08,00:07:22.08,"After three days of being a loser when I first got here,"
124,00:07:25.67,00:07:25.67,I'm proud of myself. I formed an amazing alliance.
125,00:07:29.08,00:07:29.08,It's really quite brilliant. We're going to take over the
126,00:07:31.29,00:07:31.29,whole world. That's right.
127,00:07:39.12,00:07:39.12,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Timbira getting your first look"
128,00:07:48.12,00:07:48.12,at the new Jalapao tribe. Sandy voted out at the last

130,00:07:54.83,00:07:54.83,>> PROBST: You guys ready to get to today's challenge?
131,00:07:57.00,00:07:57.00,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Today's challenge
132,00:07:58.58,00:07:58.58,"will be played in rounds. Each round, one tribe member"
133,00:08:01.83,00:08:01.83,will be seated on a spinning platform.
134,00:08:04.25,00:08:04.25,"On my ""go,"" another tribe member will race while pulling"
135,00:08:07.08,00:08:07.08,"a rope attached to that platform, causing the tribe"
136,00:08:10.17,00:08:10.17,member to get dizzy. The dizzy tribe member must
137,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,then make their way across the balance beam to the finish line.
138,00:08:16.88,00:08:16.88,"Each time you win a round for your tribe, you score a point."
139,00:08:19.25,00:08:19.25,First tribe to three points wins a reward.
140,00:08:22.25,00:08:22.25,Want to know what you're playing for?
141,00:08:23.67,00:08:23.67,">> Yeah! >> PROBST: For today's reward,"

149,00:08:44.08,00:08:44.08,go to Exile. That person will select
150,00:08:46.67,00:08:46.67,"somebody from the winning tribe to join them, which means one"
151,00:08:50.25,00:08:50.25,person from the winning tribe will not enjoy the Charmin Caf\xc3\xa9.
152,00:08:54.04,00:08:54.04,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Big stakes.
153,00:08:55.46,00:08:55.46,I'll give you a minute to strategize.

195,00:10:54.33,00:10:54.33,She doesn't. >> She's off.

205,00:11:20.04,00:11:20.04,"Big sprints. >> Hold on, Sierra."
206,00:11:22.29,00:11:22.29,"Hold on. >> Atta boy, Joe."
207,00:11:24.12,00:11:24.12,>> PROBST: J.T. spinning. Sierra is flying.

214,00:11:38.12,00:11:38.12,Like the end of a bad Friday night for J.T.

216,00:11:42.96,00:11:42.96,"Take your time, girl. >> You got it, J.T."

220,00:11:52.21,00:11:52.21,"quickly, Sierra with the early lead."
221,00:11:54.42,00:11:54.42,>> He's way back. Take your time.

244,00:13:00.54,00:13:00.54,Debbie can tie things up for Timbira if she hangs on.

250,00:13:20.04,00:13:20.04,Nice afternoon awaiting you guys.
251,00:13:22.42,00:13:22.42,Let's get down to the business at hand.
252,00:13:25.08,00:13:25.08,Who are you going to choose from Timbira to go to Exile
253,00:13:27.21,00:13:27.21,Island? >> We're going to send Brendan
254,00:13:28.92,00:13:28.92,again. >> Brendan going back to Exile
255,00:13:30.88,00:13:30.88,Island for Timbira. You're smiling.
256,00:13:33.38,00:13:33.38,>> It's evil to be able to pick somebody that just won a reward
257,00:13:35.67,00:13:35.67,"and take them out of it. >> PROBST: All right, Brendan,"
258,00:13:37.50,00:13:37.50,who are you choosing from Jalapao to go with you?
259,00:13:40.04,00:13:40.04,>> Stephen. >> What?
260,00:13:41.83,00:13:41.83,>> I love you. >> Oh...
261,00:13:45.42,00:13:45.42,">> Brendan, that was a classy move, man."
262,00:13:48.04,00:13:48.04,"That was classy, dude. >> I don't know what's going on"
263,00:13:52.08,00:13:52.08,"in Brendan's head, but, uh, he's made a lot of contact with the"
264,00:13:55.33,00:13:55.33,other tribe. Whether he's built up
265,00:13:58.42,00:13:58.42,"friendships or alliances, I don't know."
266,00:14:00.50,00:14:00.50,"But, uh, he definitely seems to have some of their respect, and"
267,00:14:04.12,00:14:04.12,"it could get dangerous. >> PROBST: Jalapao,"
268,00:14:08.21,00:14:08.21,congratulations. Grab your stuff.
269,00:14:10.08,00:14:10.08,Head out. >> Enjoy.
270,00:14:11.21,00:14:11.21,Have some for us. >> PROBST: You guys have a fun
271,00:14:13.04,00:14:13.04,afternoon in store. The Charmin Caf\xc3\xa9 is waiting.
272,00:14:44.04,00:14:44.04,>> The Charmin Caf\xc3\xa9. >> Charmin.
273,00:14:46.92,00:14:46.92,>> Yay! >> I like Charmin.
274,00:14:48.92,00:14:48.92,>> That's awesome. >> Aww.
275,00:14:51.25,00:14:51.25,">> Oh, my God! >> We can lay down after we eat."
276,00:14:53.75,00:14:53.75,">> Oh, my God! >> What are these?"
277,00:14:57.25,00:14:57.25,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God, y'all."
278,00:15:00.21,00:15:00.21,>> Who wants one of these? >> I want one of everything.
279,00:15:02.29,00:15:02.29,>> I want everything. >> This is so good.
280,00:15:05.75,00:15:05.75,>> I was very excited to go on a reward because every time we
281,00:15:08.96,00:15:08.96,"win the reward challenge, I end up going to Exile, every time."
282,00:15:13.08,00:15:13.08,I'm going to eat until I hurt. >> Mm-hmm.
283,00:15:15.25,00:15:15.25,>> All that food. All the coffee and the juice
284,00:15:18.25,00:15:18.25,and the fresh water. I didn't know what to do.
285,00:15:21.04,00:15:21.04,I forgot my name. I was just going crazy.
286,00:15:23.25,00:15:23.25,I was so happy. >> Look over there.
287,00:15:25.62,00:15:25.62,>> A potty! >> With soap.
288,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,There's soap over there! >> I'll take this over fishing
289,00:15:32.17,00:15:32.17,"gear any day. >> Oh, yeah."
290,00:15:34.12,00:15:34.12,>> It's cool getting to know my tribe because every time you
291,00:15:36.79,00:15:36.79,"go to Exile, you just separate yourself from the tribe."
292,00:15:39.12,00:15:39.12,But I'm not really worried about that because there's a
293,00:15:42.67,00:15:42.67,whole 'nother story going on with the secret alliance that no
294,00:15:46.04,00:15:46.04,"one even knows about. So, since I do have a plan B,"
295,00:15:48.96,00:15:48.96,I don't feel so nervous. You spun me around like a damn
296,00:15:51.83,00:15:51.83,tornado. >> I think Taj being gone all
297,00:15:56.12,00:15:56.12,"this time really hurts her. All the rest of us, we've been"
298,00:15:59.12,00:15:59.12,"able to really kind of gain some trust with each other, and"
299,00:16:02.29,00:16:02.29,"even talk strategy, and she hasn't had the opportunity to"
300,00:16:06.08,00:16:06.08,"create a tighter bond. >> Hey, you guys!"
301,00:16:10.17,00:16:10.17,">> What's over there? >> Oh, cool!"
302,00:16:12.54,00:16:12.54,What is it? >> What is it?
303,00:16:14.04,00:16:14.04,>> I don't know what it is. >> Is that a menu?
304,00:16:16.58,00:16:16.58,>> Maybe it's a gift certificate.
305,00:16:17.79,00:16:17.79,">> Oh, my God! >> Oh, my God."
306,00:16:22.29,00:16:22.29,"What is this? >> No way, dude."
307,00:16:24.17,00:16:24.17,">> Oh, it is a letter. Oh, my God!"
308,00:16:26.08,00:16:26.08,>> From my family. >> Oh!
309,00:16:27.92,00:16:27.92,>> Yeah! >> No way!
310,00:16:30.12,00:16:30.12,(squeals) >> I'm so happy!
311,00:16:35.21,00:16:35.21,">> No way! ""Everybody misses you like"
312,00:16:37.08,00:16:37.08,"crazy."" >> My mom would write two pages."
313,00:16:43.46,00:16:43.46,">> J.T. found letters from home, and it was not something that we"
314,00:16:47.42,00:16:47.42,expected. And it was definitely the most
315,00:16:50.25,00:16:50.25,"important reward we've had so far, as far as just for mental"
316,00:16:52.92,00:16:52.92,strength. >> Aw...
317,00:16:55.54,00:16:55.54,">> To have that reminder that, hey, your family is at home"
318,00:16:58.25,00:16:58.25,waiting for you. There is something outside the
319,00:16:59.67,00:16:59.67,"game. >> Oh, man."
320,00:17:04.38,00:17:04.38,>> All my nieces gave me something.
321,00:17:07.79,00:17:07.79,">> Oh, this is good, man. (crying)"
322,00:17:11.42,00:17:11.42,">> Oh, my gosh. >> I know, y'all."
323,00:17:15.54,00:17:15.54,>> Sorry. >> Tears of joy.
324,00:17:17.38,00:17:17.38,"It's the first time my dad's ever said something like,"
325,00:17:20.38,00:17:20.38,"""Be careful and be safe."" >> She said it there?"
326,00:17:25.58,00:17:25.58,>> She told me at the end. I almost started crying.
327,00:17:28.71,00:17:28.71,">> Yeah, I almost lost it there for..."
328,00:17:31.25,00:17:31.25,">> Oh, God. Being out here for so long, you"
329,00:17:33.83,00:17:33.83,almost forget what home is like and what the people are like
330,00:17:37.25,00:17:37.25,"that you love and to get a letter, and to just hear them"
331,00:17:40.58,00:17:40.58,tell you that they miss you and they're proud of you and they
332,00:17:42.38,00:17:42.38,just... Oh!
333,00:17:43.17,00:17:43.17,That was just the icing on the cake.
334,00:17:45.25,00:17:45.25,I would have been sick if I had to go to Exile and miss that.
335,00:17:54.25,00:17:54.25,">> This is not much for us to eat, you know."
336,00:17:57.25,00:17:57.25,">> Out of all the challenges so far, I wanted that one the most."
337,00:17:59.71,00:17:59.71,>> Mm-hmm. >> Yeah.
338,00:18:23.58,00:18:23.58,">> Yeah. Brendan right now, the way he's"
339,00:18:25.75,00:18:25.75,"going to Exile, and the people that he's choosing for Exile,"
340,00:18:29.04,00:18:29.04,"is making strong allies. If we merge, he has control of"
341,00:18:35.29,00:18:35.29,"the game, and I'm a bystander. And I certainly don't want that"
342,00:18:39.12,00:18:39.12,to happen. Feel the breeze shift?
343,00:18:51.33,00:18:51.33,I've noticed that the wind blows this way predominantly.
344,00:18:56.08,00:18:56.08,"But when there's a storm coming, it switches directions."
345,00:18:58.58,00:18:58.58,It turns this way. But it doesn't look too crazy
346,00:19:01.04,00:19:01.04,because it looks like the clouds are breaking up on the
347,00:19:03.17,00:19:03.17,horizon. (thunder rumbles)
348,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,">> Oh, my gosh. Coach is kind of a jackass."
349,00:19:21.58,00:19:21.58,He's been running his mouth about the weather at camp.
350,00:19:24.62,00:19:24.62,"I think Coach really, truly wants to be this, like,"
351,00:19:27.50,00:19:27.50,"""Survivor Man."" I would not be surprised if,"
352,00:19:36.92,00:19:36.92,"when this game is all said and done, Coach said, ""Gotcha!"
353,00:19:42.21,00:19:42.21,"I'm an accountant. I've never left Nebraska."""
354,00:19:52.58,00:19:52.58,">> So, uh, this is your Brazilian hideaway?"
355,00:19:55.54,00:19:55.54,>> This is my vacation pad. >> It's-it's quite stunning.
356,00:20:01.67,00:20:01.67,">> Yeah. >> Okay, cool."
357,00:20:03.21,00:20:03.21,So this will be fun. >> Yeah.
358,00:20:04.75,00:20:04.75,">> Awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome."
359,00:20:07.08,00:20:07.08,I picked Stephen to go to Exile in order to put the final piece
360,00:20:10.67,00:20:10.67,"of the puzzle in place. He didn't know me, didn't know"
361,00:20:13.67,00:20:13.67,"Sierra, so I'm really excited to catch up with him about,"
362,00:20:16.92,00:20:16.92,"you know, how we could work together, just to make him feel"
363,00:20:19.92,00:20:19.92,comfortable with that alliance. So this is the view from the
364,00:20:22.33,00:20:22.33,"top. >> Oh, man."
365,00:20:24.25,00:20:24.25,"Oh, wow. >> It's pretty, right?"
366,00:20:26.21,00:20:26.21,>> It is. >> It's crazy.
367,00:20:27.42,00:20:27.42,It's like an oasis. >> We've got the hidden immunity
368,00:20:30.21,00:20:30.21,idol. >> You brought it with you?
369,00:20:31.75,00:20:31.75,">> Yeah. >> Oh, nice."
370,00:20:32.96,00:20:32.96,You guys actually have it. >> Yeah.
371,00:20:34.12,00:20:34.12,>> I was concerned she didn't have it.
372,00:20:35.58,00:20:35.58,>> No. We got it this morning. >> You did?
373,00:20:37.79,00:20:37.79,>> Yeah. >> When Stephen and I first
374,00:20:39.71,00:20:39.71,"arrived, we started talking immediately, and he told me that"
375,00:20:43.21,00:20:43.21,he had the hidden immunity idol. I told him I had also had found
376,00:20:46.17,00:20:46.17,"the idol, so now this four-person alliance has both"
377,00:20:49.17,00:20:49.17,"immunity idols, which is great because it's going to put us in"
378,00:20:52.29,00:20:52.29,a powerful spot. >> Yeah.
379,00:20:54.17,00:20:54.17,"So, there's more wood. We should probably just go grab"
380,00:20:56.04,00:20:56.04,more big trunks like that and load up for tonight.
381,00:21:00.21,00:21:00.21,>> Cool. Brendan.
382,00:21:02.50,00:21:02.50,"My first impression of him is positive, but wary."
383,00:21:06.12,00:21:06.12,He's obviously an extremely strong player.
384,00:21:08.79,00:21:08.79,He's mentally strong and he's clearly strategically strong.
385,00:21:11.92,00:21:11.92,"But, you know, it's hard to trust someone who..."
386,00:21:14.96,00:21:14.96,"You know, I've known him for five minutes."
387,00:21:16.75,00:21:16.75,I can't place my entire faith in the game on him.
388,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,"So, I might keep this two-tribe alliance in the back of my head"
389,00:21:22.21,00:21:22.21,"as something that might be there, but I can't place my"
390,00:21:24.58,00:21:24.58,entire faith on this four-person alliance.
391,00:21:43.08,00:21:43.08,>> I had a crazy dream last night.
392,00:21:44.67,00:21:44.67,">> About what? >> My boyfriend, Kelly."
393,00:21:46.83,00:21:46.83,"He had, like, a salsa... a, like, chips and salsa thing"
394,00:21:52.00,00:21:52.00,in his hand as this earthquake was going on.
395,00:21:55.21,00:21:55.21,It was just really strange. But it was nice to see Kelly.
396,00:21:59.38,00:21:59.38,>> Right. >> I woke up.
397,00:22:01.33,00:22:01.33,"I'm like, ""I have to marry this guy."""
398,00:22:03.92,00:22:03.92,"I can't live without this guy."" So, no girls to whet your"
399,00:22:08.29,00:22:08.29,appetite? No one does it for you?
400,00:22:12.33,00:22:12.33,">> None, uh... None right now."
401,00:22:14.12,00:22:14.12,"There are a lot of cute girls at U.F., though."
402,00:22:16.17,00:22:16.17,">> Yeah? >> A lot of them, yeah."
403,00:22:18.46,00:22:18.46,"I'm not in a rush. There's, there are those people"
404,00:22:20.25,00:22:20.25,who just need to be in a relationship.
405,00:22:22.04,00:22:22.04,They just need to have that person.
406,00:22:23.38,00:22:23.38,"I'm like, I'm not one of those people."
407,00:22:25.38,00:22:25.38,>> Yeah. >> So I don't know.
408,00:22:27.62,00:22:27.62,>> It's nice to be free. >> Yeah.
409,00:22:29.50,00:22:29.50,>> Especially at your age. >> Feel like that's pretty cool.
410,00:22:33.29,00:22:33.29,My tribe mates are not aware that I'm gay.
411,00:22:36.25,00:22:36.25,"I haven't told them, only because I feel like, in the"
412,00:22:39.71,00:22:39.71,"culture that we live in, there's nothing really to gain,"
413,00:22:42.21,00:22:42.21,"or not much to gain, by people finding out that you are gay."
414,00:22:45.21,00:22:45.21,"I figure, I've got time in the future."
415,00:22:47.17,00:22:47.17,I'm not getting married anytime soon.
416,00:22:48.50,00:22:48.50,">> Gosh, all you have is time. >> I know, so..."
417,00:22:52.12,00:22:52.12,"I don't like hiding it, though. I would like to be able to have"
418,00:22:54.42,00:22:54.42,"those conversations. When we're talking about girls,"
419,00:22:56.58,00:22:56.58,"I-I wouldn't mind, you know, making like, ""Spencer, what type"
420,00:22:59.04,00:22:59.04,"of guy do you like?"" or something."
421,00:23:00.88,00:23:00.88,But I know that that's not the best option for me in the game
422,00:23:03.25,00:23:03.25,"at this point, so... >> Tree mail!"
423,00:23:08.29,00:23:08.29,"""Connecting with your tribe will keep you alive."
424,00:23:11.25,00:23:11.25,Battling the others is part of the game.
425,00:23:14.08,00:23:14.08,The meek and the slow will lose one more.
426,00:23:17.21,00:23:17.21,"The aggressive protect their flame."""
427,00:23:19.46,00:23:19.46,">> ""Connecting with your tribe."" >> ""Connecting with your tribe."""
428,00:23:22.54,00:23:22.54,">> Guys like J.T., typical Southerners, you know, people"
429,00:23:25.92,00:23:25.92,"who are generally not quite as accepting of homosexuality, and"
430,00:23:30.12,00:23:30.12,"I don't know if he's one of those guys, but they are maybe"
431,00:23:34.08,00:23:34.08,inclined to get rid of somebody like me just based on fact that
432,00:23:36.46,00:23:36.46,I am gay. >> This is definitely my kind
433,00:23:38.75,00:23:38.75,of game right here. I can catch and throw anything.
434,00:23:41.42,00:23:41.42,>> And that's disappointing. And it's one of the reasons why
435,00:23:43.88,00:23:43.88,"I keep it a secret. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys!"
436,00:24:05.29,00:24:05.29,"We'll now bring in Brendan and Stephen, returning from Exile"
437,00:24:08.00,00:24:08.00,Island. >> Welcome back.
438,00:24:14.21,00:24:14.21,">> What's up, Stevie? >> Hello."
439,00:24:16.21,00:24:16.21,>> Oh. You need some water?
440,00:24:19.71,00:24:19.71,>> Awesome. >> PROBST: Guys ready to get to
441,00:24:21.12,00:24:21.12,today's challenge? >> Yeah.
442,00:24:22.38,00:24:22.38,">> PROBST: First things first; Debbie, give it up."
443,00:24:27.88,00:24:27.88,">> I missed you guys. >> PROBST: Once again, immunity"
444,00:24:30.17,00:24:30.17,"is back up for grabs. For today's challenge, two"
445,00:24:33.54,00:24:33.54,members of each tribe will alternate launching balls out
446,00:24:36.75,00:24:36.75,"onto the course, where the remaining tribe members will"
447,00:24:39.50,00:24:39.50,catch the ball. It doesn't matter what color
448,00:24:42.25,00:24:42.25,the ball is. You catch a ball from either
449,00:24:44.08,00:24:44.08,"tribe, you score a point for your tribe."
450,00:24:46.62,00:24:46.62,First tribe to five wins immunity.
451,00:24:49.50,00:24:49.50,"Losing tribe, Tribal Council, where somebody will be voted out"
452,00:24:54.17,00:24:54.17,of this game. Worth playing for?
453,00:24:56.88,00:24:56.88,">> Yeah! >> PROBST: All right, give you"
454,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,a minute to strategize. We'll get started.
455,00:25:04.88,00:25:04.88,Here we go. The launchers for Jalapao:
456,00:25:07.54,00:25:07.54,Sydney and Stephen. For Timbira: Erinn and Debbie.

460,00:25:21.42,00:25:21.42,"Survivors ready? Three, two, one, launch!"
461,00:25:26.46,00:25:26.46,"Erinn goes short over to Brendan, who just misses."
462,00:25:29.54,00:25:29.54,>> J.T.! >> PROBST: Sydney goes deep to

466,00:25:37.75,00:25:37.75,"with their first point. Okay, here we go."
467,00:25:40.88,00:25:40.88,"Next round. Three, two, one, launch."
468,00:25:47.08,00:25:47.08,Debbie goes deep. Stephen goes deep.
469,00:25:50.67,00:25:50.67,>> Wow! >> PROBST: J.T. with another
470,00:25:52.42,00:25:52.42,great catch! Joe!
471,00:25:54.12,00:25:54.12,">> In his hand. >> PROBST: In and out, in and"

474,00:26:04.08,00:26:04.08,"We are now at 2-zip. >> Oh, boy."
475,00:26:10.21,00:26:10.21,">> PROBST: Here we go. Three, two, one, launch."
476,00:26:14.08,00:26:14.08,Erinn and Sydney both release their balls.
477,00:26:16.79,00:26:16.79,Brendan with a nice stab. J.T. just misses.
478,00:26:20.71,00:26:20.71,Timbira on the board now with their first point.
479,00:26:23.38,00:26:23.38,">> All right, Brendan! >> PROBST: Jalapao leads 2-1."

481,00:26:30.12,00:26:30.12,launch. Both balls in the air.
482,00:26:36.08,00:26:36.08,Brendan with a great snag for Timbira.
483,00:26:40.75,00:26:40.75,"We are now at 2-2. >> Taj, come on, baby."
484,00:26:44.50,00:26:44.50,">> Hey, I am doing my best. >> PROBST: Taj is wearing down."
485,00:26:48.50,00:26:48.50,That's giving Brendan a big opening.
486,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,"Here we go. Three, two, one, launch."
487,00:26:56.46,00:26:56.46,Both balls in the air. J.T. snags another one for
488,00:27:03.25,00:27:03.25,"Jalapao! >> Oh, he knocked a tooth."
489,00:27:08.25,00:27:08.25,>> We've got a tooth out. >> He just lost a tooth.

493,00:27:21.50,00:27:21.50,Let's find the tooth. You're going to want that tooth.
494,00:27:24.25,00:27:24.25,>> It's only half of it. >> I-I didn't see him get hit.
495,00:27:27.42,00:27:27.42,">> Is that it? You want this back, J.T.?"
496,00:27:31.25,00:27:31.25,">> No, it-it don't matter. >> PROBST: Here, I'll hold it."
497,00:27:33.17,00:27:33.17,Give it to me. (Taj groans)
498,00:27:36.17,00:27:36.17,">> Oh, my God. (Sydney exhales sharply)"
499,00:27:39.00,00:27:39.00,">> Are you bleeding, J.T.? You all right, man?"

506,00:28:01.12,00:28:01.12,">> PROBST: J.T., unbelievable! Another catch for Jalapao!"
507,00:28:05.79,00:28:05.79,">> Yeah, J.T.! >> PROBST: We are now at 4-2."
508,00:28:09.67,00:28:09.67,Jalapao needs just one more point to win.

545,00:30:30.96,00:30:30.96,to win. Broke the back half of my front
546,00:30:33.17,00:30:33.17,"tooth off, but it just seemed like some people wasn't giving"
547,00:30:35.33,00:30:35.33,it all. I don't want to get rid of
548,00:30:37.08,00:30:37.08,"anyone, but it's got to be Spencer."
549,00:30:48.00,00:30:48.00,(birds chirping) >> I was hot today.
550,00:31:01.33,00:31:01.33,"I was so hot, I was exhausted. And I was hot meaning angry."
551,00:31:05.33,00:31:05.33,Today's challenge frustrated me to no end.
552,00:31:07.58,00:31:07.58,"I just, I'm telling you, I just really felt like it was brutal."
553,00:31:10.62,00:31:10.62,">> No, it's already scabbed up a little bit."
554,00:31:12.42,00:31:12.42,">> Oh, yeah, it is swollen up around it."
555,00:31:15.08,00:31:15.08,>> Yeah. >> Joe and J.T. got beat up bad.
556,00:31:18.08,00:31:18.08,And I was angry because I fell short today.
557,00:31:21.33,00:31:21.33,"I think I'm a target, but I completely believe that they're"
558,00:31:25.08,00:31:25.08,crazy to keep Spencer over me if they're trying to keep the
559,00:31:28.12,00:31:28.12,"tribe strong because I think, uh, Spencer, his play today was"
560,00:31:32.12,00:31:32.12,far worse than anybody else's. We're only down one.
561,00:31:38.67,00:31:38.67,I think whatever we need to do next needs to be the best
562,00:31:41.08,00:31:41.08,"chance to make it even, 5-5 at the merge."
563,00:31:43.88,00:31:43.88,That means everybody needs to leave their little emotions out
564,00:31:45.92,00:31:45.92,of it and think for the team. Everybody.
565,00:31:48.88,00:31:48.88,"You, him, everybody. I'm-I'm hot today."
566,00:31:51.67,00:31:51.67,So I don't give a ... what nobody thinks about me today.
567,00:31:54.12,00:31:54.12,Everybody can kiss my ass. >> Can we talk through this
568,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,"thing? >> We can talk, but I just"
569,00:31:59.21,00:31:59.21,want it to be... I'm not going to sit here and
570,00:32:01.25,00:32:01.25,talk bull. I'm not going to sit here and
571,00:32:02.83,00:32:02.83,"talk stuff, and then we do something different at Tribal"
572,00:32:04.42,00:32:04.42,Council. Do what's going to be best for
573,00:32:06.42,00:32:06.42,the team. >> If it makes you feel any
574,00:32:10.17,00:32:10.17,"better, Taj, I trust you more than I do other people in the"
575,00:32:12.54,00:32:12.54,"tribe. >> Well, thank you."
576,00:32:13.96,00:32:13.96,">> Me, too. >> I trust you, for sure."
577,00:32:19.50,00:32:19.50,>> You trust me? >> I trust everybody here.
578,00:32:21.25,00:32:21.25,>> Why haven't you never come to me for an-an ally?
579,00:32:23.29,00:32:23.29,Why have you never come to me like that?
580,00:32:25.29,00:32:25.29,"No, you've never come to me like that."
581,00:32:27.08,00:32:27.08,"You've never said to me and said, ""Let's do this together"""
582,00:32:28.92,00:32:28.92,"or ""Let's try to..."" You've never..."
583,00:32:31.29,00:32:31.29,">> It's a two-way road, right? >> Hey, I've tried to talk to"
584,00:32:34.62,00:32:34.62,you. I'm not attacking you.
585,00:32:36.33,00:32:36.33,"I'm just pissed today, and I'm sick of this game, sick of it."
586,00:32:43.71,00:32:43.71,>> Taj was-was hot at me. I-I really don't know why.
587,00:32:46.96,00:32:46.96,She can bat every eyelash and raise every feather that she
588,00:32:50.96,00:32:50.96,"has, but, you know, I think moves like that out here will"
589,00:32:54.12,00:32:54.12,"get you voted off, bottom line. And if Taj has the idol, I"
590,00:32:59.21,00:32:59.21,think it's the best decision. >> I think she's just scared.
591,00:33:03.04,00:33:03.04,"I mean, you know, at least... she has an emotional outburst,"
592,00:33:05.38,00:33:05.38,but it's totally honest. What do you think?
593,00:33:15.42,00:33:15.42,">> I have a really tough choice ahead tonight because,"
594,00:33:20.12,00:33:20.12,"theoretically, I am better served by Taj going home"
595,00:33:24.42,00:33:24.42,"without the idol because that means it's mine to keep,"
596,00:33:29.38,00:33:29.38,"but right now, Taj, she's my real connection with the"
597,00:33:32.83,00:33:32.83,"Timbira side of the Exile alliance, Brendan and Sierra."
598,00:33:35.92,00:33:35.92,So I'm not totally clear what I'm going to do.
599,00:33:40.17,00:33:40.17,">> I'm just pissed off, man. I'm so pissed off."
600,00:33:43.83,00:33:43.83,I feel like we just let that one go.
601,00:33:46.12,00:33:46.12,"It could very well possibly be it for me tonight, but I still"
602,00:33:48.71,00:33:48.71,have the immunity idol. And I have Steve kind of
603,00:33:51.29,00:33:51.29,keeping an ear out for everything that's going on.
604,00:33:53.29,00:33:53.29,He'll let me know if I really need to pull it out or not.
605,00:33:56.08,00:33:56.08,"They're down there whispering, so if you all want"
606,00:33:57.83,00:33:57.83,"to get a piece, go ahead. >> Today's challenge was very"
607,00:34:06.08,00:34:06.08,frustrating because I'm a competitive person.
608,00:34:08.08,00:34:08.08,"And I hate not only to lose, but also to perform badly."
609,00:34:11.79,00:34:11.79,And I knew that J.T. was probably going to be
610,00:34:14.25,00:34:14.25,frustrated with me. >> I don't have any problem
611,00:34:16.88,00:34:16.88,writing his name down because Spencer try and guess where it
612,00:34:19.67,00:34:19.67,was going. That was obvious.
613,00:34:22.08,00:34:22.08,He's not going to listen to what you tell him.
614,00:34:24.08,00:34:24.08,He's going to do it his way. He wants everybody to do it
615,00:34:26.04,00:34:26.04,his way. His way... you know.
616,00:34:30.04,00:34:30.04,"Whatever. I just want to win, man."
617,00:34:34.04,00:34:34.04,">> We have to win now. >> Yeah, I hate losing."
618,00:34:41.08,00:34:41.08,">> It's rough around camp. It's very, very tense."
619,00:34:44.04,00:34:44.04,And it's scary for sure because things switch so
620,00:34:49.00,00:34:49.00,"quickly in this game. >> What do you think, Spencer?"
621,00:34:52.25,00:34:52.25,">> I figured you'd come back pissed at me, so..."
622,00:34:56.21,00:34:56.21,">> I was pissed at you, especially the challenge."
623,00:34:59.17,00:34:59.17,>> You think I wasn't giving my effort?
624,00:35:01.29,00:35:01.29,>> It didn't look like you tackled him.
625,00:35:03.25,00:35:03.25,"I said, ""Tackle him."" >> I knew I was probably going"
626,00:35:06.17,00:35:06.17,"to be on the chopping block, so..."
627,00:35:08.21,00:35:08.21,>> I can't speak for the whole team.
628,00:35:11.12,00:35:11.12,"I'm just telling you how I feel, you know."
629,00:35:12.42,00:35:12.42,">> I know, but, obviously, you have pull in the tribe, and..."
630,00:35:15.67,00:35:15.67,I feel like it would be beneficial to the tribe to keep
631,00:35:20.17,00:35:20.17,me for the next immunity challenge.
632,00:35:23.04,00:35:23.04,"I feel... obviously, I want to stay, but I feel like I'm not"
633,00:35:26.79,00:35:26.79,the worst person to keep around. But that's...
634,00:35:30.75,00:35:30.75,"obviously up to the other five people who are voting, not just"
635,00:35:32.67,00:35:32.67,me. Who do you think should go?
636,00:35:36.58,00:35:36.58,>> I don't know. >> You can tell me.
637,00:35:39.17,00:35:39.17,>> I think you or Taj. >> PROBST: Let's talk about
638,00:36:05.71,00:36:05.71,"today's challenge. Spencer, how did you feel about"
639,00:36:08.12,00:36:08.12,your performance today? >> My performance today was
640,00:36:11.29,00:36:11.29,pretty pathetic. I definitely felt like I let my
641,00:36:14.04,00:36:14.04,"guys down, and I was just very upset with myself just the whole"
642,00:36:16.46,00:36:16.46,"time. >> PROBST: Taj, do you feel"
643,00:36:19.04,00:36:19.04,"this tribe is still staying together well or, after a loss,"
644,00:36:21.46,00:36:21.46,can you feel the effect of losing?
645,00:36:24.29,00:36:24.29,>> We can definitely feel the the effect of losing.
646,00:36:26.62,00:36:26.62,"And, of course, everybody's frustrated, so we're just"
647,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67,trying to believe that the next challenge we'll be able to tie
648,00:36:32.12,00:36:32.12,"it up and go into the merge even, at least."
649,00:36:35.67,00:36:35.67,>> PROBST: So how does that manifest itself back at camp?
650,00:36:38.42,00:36:38.42,">> Well, initially, we all kind of blew up."
651,00:36:40.83,00:36:40.83,"Well, I won't say we all... I kind of blew up because I"
652,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,"just felt like it was so mismatched that... I don't know,"
653,00:36:46.12,00:36:46.12,"I just felt like we could have definitely done a better job,"
654,00:36:48.67,00:36:48.67,"and I got upset. >> PROBST: Joe, what does it"
655,00:36:51.12,00:36:51.12,feel like to have somebody walk up and start attacking you?
656,00:36:53.50,00:36:53.50,>> You don't ever like to walk into a room and have fingers
657,00:36:56.12,00:36:56.12,"pointed at you, especially when it's not necessarily"
658,00:36:59.25,00:36:59.25,"even warranted. >> PROBST: Taj, does it worry"
659,00:37:01.17,00:37:01.17,you that you could have an outburst that could cost you in
660,00:37:03.58,00:37:03.58,this game? >> Anything you do could cost
661,00:37:05.42,00:37:05.42,you this game. So an outburst is just another
662,00:37:08.04,00:37:08.04,form of anything that can happen to get you out of this
663,00:37:10.75,00:37:10.75,"game. And at that point, I felt like I"
664,00:37:13.12,00:37:13.12,was on my way out the door. >> PROBST: And what made feel
665,00:37:15.42,00:37:15.42,"that, your performance? >> You know what, I don't know,"
666,00:37:17.71,00:37:17.71,it's just a feeling you get that your head is next.
667,00:37:20.96,00:37:20.96,"And I was pissed off because, at every challenge, I do give"
668,00:37:23.25,00:37:23.25,"110%, no matter if we lose or win, and to even have the idea"
669,00:37:28.12,00:37:28.12,"that you're going to go out, and I'm trying to figure out why."
670,00:37:31.29,00:37:31.29,I was hot. So whoever was there was going
671,00:37:33.46,00:37:33.46,"to get it, and I didn't care who."
672,00:37:36.00,00:37:36.00,">> PROBST: Spencer, do you know what she's talking about in"
673,00:37:37.96,00:37:37.96,"terms of just a gut: ""People aren't talking to me the same"
674,00:37:40.38,00:37:40.38,"way, or they're avoiding me."" >> Absolutely."
675,00:37:43.67,00:37:43.67,"It definitely changes when you get back to camp, and you know"
676,00:37:47.08,00:37:47.08,that your head could be on the chopping block.
677,00:37:50.21,00:37:50.21,"Today, I had the same feeling because of my performance in"
678,00:37:52.67,00:37:52.67,the challenge and the frustration with J.T.
679,00:37:54.79,00:37:54.79,during the challenge. I came back knowing that I
680,00:37:57.04,00:37:57.04,could very well be going home tonight.
681,00:37:59.29,00:37:59.29,"It's not a feeling that is enjoyable, for sure."
682,00:38:01.96,00:38:01.96,"But I know what she's talking about, and I definitely felt it"
683,00:38:03.92,00:38:03.92,"a bit today, too. >> PROBST: Taj, you've spent a"
684,00:38:06.67,00:38:06.67,lot of time out on Exile Island. >> That I have.
685,00:38:09.29,00:38:09.29,">> PROBST: That can work two ways: you're gone so much,"
686,00:38:11.33,00:38:11.33,they don't have any reason to get rid of you; you're gone so
687,00:38:13.54,00:38:13.54,"much they don't know you, might as well get rid of her."
688,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,">> Yeah, and, I mean, what can I do about it?"
689,00:38:18.54,00:38:18.54,"I don't ask to go to Exile, so it's not like I had a choice."
690,00:38:21.92,00:38:21.92,There's nothing I can do about it except for fit in when I
691,00:38:24.42,00:38:24.42,come back. >> PROBST: Do you feel the
692,00:38:26.25,00:38:26.25,"target on your back, spending so much time away from the tribe?"
693,00:38:29.42,00:38:29.42,">> I didn't start feeling that until maybe this week, just"
694,00:38:33.83,00:38:33.83,because we're down to no more expendable people.
695,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,"I'm, like, that person, I guess, if they thought I had"
696,00:38:39.67,00:38:39.67,"the idol, they didn't think I'd need to be here because,"
697,00:38:41.88,00:38:41.88,"obviously, I would be a threat. >> PROBST: Joe, how do you deal"
698,00:38:44.71,00:38:44.71,"with Taj, knowing she's been out there three times, a lot of"
699,00:38:47.88,00:38:47.88,opportunities to find the hidden immunity idol.
700,00:38:50.58,00:38:50.58,>> You can't ever be certain. She could definitely have it.
701,00:38:53.17,00:38:53.17,"I haven't actually heard her say the words, ""I do not have"
702,00:38:56.08,00:38:56.08,"the immunity idol."" >> Would you like me to say it"
703,00:38:58.21,00:38:58.21,"now? >> No, you don't have to."
704,00:38:59.79,00:38:59.79,">> Okay. >> See, so stuff like that"
705,00:39:01.79,00:39:01.79,makes you think that she's really being aggressive about
706,00:39:04.04,00:39:04.04,hiding this thing or lying about it if she does have it.
707,00:39:07.25,00:39:07.25,">> If I did say something, would it mean I did had it."
708,00:39:09.21,00:39:09.21,">> No, I'm just saying, little indicators like that,"
709,00:39:11.08,00:39:11.08,">> I can't win. >> So she hasn't slipped once,"
710,00:39:14.25,00:39:14.25,so I believe her. >> PROBST: And yet she still
711,00:39:16.21,00:39:16.21,has not said she doesn't have it.
712,00:39:18.17,00:39:18.17,>> You want to say it for me? >> I do not have the idol.
713,00:39:21.04,00:39:21.04,">> Okay, see, I believe her. >> Should I say it to everyone"
714,00:39:22.79,00:39:22.79,here? >> I believe her.
715,00:39:26.79,00:39:26.79,>> PROBST: And that is what it comes down to: whether or not
716,00:39:29.62,00:39:29.62,you believe what the people in your tribe are telling you.
717,00:39:32.96,00:39:32.96,Somebody is about to find out the truth.
718,00:39:34.83,00:39:34.83,"It is time to vote. Joe, you're up."
719,00:39:47.58,00:39:47.58,>> I'm pretty sure it's either me or you tonight.
720,00:40:07.00,00:40:07.00,>> You played a hell of a game and I'm sorry it came down to
721,00:40:09.79,00:40:09.79,this. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
722,00:40:24.12,00:40:24.12,votes. If anybody has the hidden
723,00:40:34.58,00:40:34.58,"immunity idol and you want to play it, now would the time to"
724,00:40:37.04,00:40:37.04,"do so. All right, once the votes are"
725,00:40:42.71,00:40:42.71,"read, the decision is final. Person voted out will be asked"
726,00:40:45.00,00:40:45.00,to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
727,00:40:47.04,00:40:47.04,I'll read the votes. First vote: Spencer.
728,00:40:56.54,00:40:56.54,Taj. One vote Spencer; one vote Taj.
729,00:41:02.00,00:41:02.00,Spencer. Two votes Spencer; one vote Taj.
730,00:41:08.29,00:41:08.29,Spencer. That's three votes Spencer;
731,00:41:12.46,00:41:12.46,one vote Taj. Fifth person voted out of
732,00:41:19.08,00:41:19.08,Survivor: Tocantins: Spencer. That's four votes.
733,00:41:22.79,00:41:22.79,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
734,00:41:30.33,00:41:30.33,"Spencer, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
735,00:41:35.92,00:41:35.92,">> Bye, guys. >> PROBST: Well, you've lost two"
736,00:41:50.33,00:41:50.33,"immunity challenges in a row, two tribe members in a row."
737,00:41:53.58,00:41:53.58,"Worse than that, you lost momentum."
738,00:41:56.29,00:41:56.29,Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
