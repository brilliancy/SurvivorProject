2,00:00:03.29,00:00:03.29,"Survivor... Knowing they were outnumbered,"
3,00:00:07.21,00:00:07.21,the men of Raro got to work. >> I think they're definitely
4,00:00:10.62,00:00:10.62,trying to prove themselves to the women so that the women
5,00:00:13.08,00:00:13.08,don't try to overthrow all of the guys.
6,00:00:15.29,00:00:15.29,I love it. >> PROBST: At the reward
7,00:00:18.46,00:00:18.46,challenge... >> Pull it in.
8,00:00:20.21,00:00:20.21,"Pull it in. >> PROBST: ...together, Nate and"
9,00:00:22.21,00:00:22.21,Adam were unstoppable. >> Raro wins reward.
10,00:00:26.12,00:00:26.12,">> PROBST: And Jonathan was sent to Exile Island, where he came"
11,00:00:29.62,00:00:29.62,to a realization. >> I dug for hours and there was
12,00:00:33.08,00:00:33.08,no idol there. At this point I have to assume
13,00:00:35.75,00:00:35.75,the idol has been found. >> PROBST: Back at Raro...
14,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,">> We've got to get that pot. >> Oh, you know what?"
15,00:00:41.21,00:00:41.21,We need some more salt water. >> PROBST: ...Christina was
16,00:00:43.17,00:00:43.17,testing her tribe's patience. >> We're all annoyed by
17,00:00:45.17,00:00:45.17,"Christina. She tells people, ""Can you do"
18,00:00:47.88,00:00:47.88,"this, can you do that?"" >> Somebody help."
19,00:00:51.08,00:00:51.08,>> She'd better watch herself. >> PROBST: At the immunity
20,00:00:53.33,00:00:53.33,challenge... >> Rebecca's not up.
21,00:00:55.96,00:00:55.96,>> PROBST: ...Raro fell short. >> Aitu wins immunity!
22,00:01:01.71,00:01:01.71,">> PROBST: After the challenge, the tribe was united on who was"
23,00:01:04.38,00:01:04.38,next to go. >> Okay.
24,00:01:08.67,00:01:08.67,>> Yeah. >> Yeah.
25,00:01:10.50,00:01:10.50,>> PROBST: but Stephannie's talk of home...
26,00:01:12.75,00:01:12.75,>> I can see myself going home and getting some mashed potatoes
27,00:01:14.79,00:01:14.79,and gravy. >> PROBST: ...made the tribe
28,00:01:17.75,00:01:17.75,wonder if her head was in the game.
29,00:01:19.25,00:01:19.25,>> She's already mentally checked out.
30,00:01:21.21,00:01:21.21,">> PROBST: At tribal council... >> You know, I thought Christina"
31,00:01:23.17,00:01:23.17,"knew she was kind of, like, that way."
32,00:01:25.21,00:01:25.21,>> PROBST: ...Christina learned she was on shaky ground.
33,00:01:27.08,00:01:27.08,">> It's just her personality. You know, it can be a little"
34,00:01:29.21,00:01:29.21,nerve-wracking sometimes. >> PROBST: But in the end...
35,00:01:32.00,00:01:32.00,The fifth person voted out of Cook Islands...
36,00:01:33.96,00:01:33.96,It was Stephannie who was sent home.
37,00:01:35.79,00:01:35.79,"Stephanie, the tribe has spoken. 14 are left."
38,00:01:39.79,00:01:39.79,Who will be voted out tonight?  Captioning sponsored by

40,00:02:05.42,00:02:05.42,">> When we came back from tribal, there was a lot of"
41,00:02:08.17,00:02:08.17,"tension, like I knew there would be."
42,00:02:10.08,00:02:10.08,And I knew that Christina was offended by what had happened
43,00:02:12.12,00:02:12.12,during tribal council. It wasn't intended.
44,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,It didn't mean to come out. But Adam responded.
45,00:02:18.71,00:02:18.71,And unfortunately she got her feelings hurt.
46,00:02:20.92,00:02:20.92,">> You know what's funny, is for the past few days you guys have"
47,00:02:23.04,00:02:23.04,been kind of rude. And I've noticed it.
48,00:02:25.00,00:02:25.00,"Like, when it comes to passing things, you snapped at me twice."
49,00:02:27.17,00:02:27.17,>> I said you were annoying tonight.
50,00:02:29.21,00:02:29.21,">> No, you didn't say that. >> And then I left it alone."
51,00:02:31.08,00:02:31.08,>> You never said that. When did you say that?
52,00:02:32.79,00:02:32.79,">> Talking about passing things, you're like, ""Give me that, give"
53,00:02:34.46,00:02:34.46,"me that."" I mean, it just gets..."
54,00:02:36.21,00:02:36.21,>> I always say please. I always say please.
55,00:02:37.75,00:02:37.75,">> No, you don't. No, you don't."
56,00:02:40.96,00:02:40.96,>> I have heard Adam snap at Christina and calling her
57,00:02:43.00,00:02:43.00,annoying and I thought that was kind of a little bit of a low
58,00:02:45.08,00:02:45.08,blow. She's used to being in control.
59,00:02:48.88,00:02:48.88,She's not used to people telling her what to do.
60,00:02:50.58,00:02:50.58,And it's really showing. >> It's your personality.
61,00:02:52.17,00:02:52.17,">> Well, you could have said something to me."
62,00:02:53.96,00:02:53.96,>> Your personality is... >> We have to accept you the way
63,00:02:55.50,00:02:55.50,you are. That's it.
64,00:02:57.21,00:02:57.21,">> No, but you could have said something if it was bothering"
65,00:02:58.67,00:02:58.67,"you. >> We can't change you,"
66,00:03:00.12,00:03:00.12,Christina. >> It's not like you're sitting
67,00:03:01.88,00:03:01.88,around not doing anything and we want you to change that.
68,00:03:03.62,00:03:03.62,">> You said I annoyed you. >> I mean, it's just the way it"
69,00:03:05.38,00:03:05.38,is. >> I just don't understand.
70,00:03:12.75,00:03:12.75,I never thought that's what they thought of me.
71,00:03:15.25,00:03:15.25,But I'm going to stick my head up high still.
72,00:03:19.08,00:03:19.08,And I have gone through a lot of stuff.
73,00:03:21.25,00:03:21.25,I have been shot and all of that stuff.
74,00:03:23.04,00:03:23.04,"I mean, yeah, those are tragedies in my life."
75,00:03:25.08,00:03:25.08,I know survived a lot of other things in my life.
76,00:03:26.79,00:03:26.79,I'm going to survive this. >> Nice.
77,00:05:07.50,00:05:07.50,"Look at that. One, two, three, four, five more"
78,00:05:11.38,00:05:11.38,of them. Jonathan and I went fishing this
79,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,morning. We went out to my same little
80,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,spot that I like. I'm getting to know that area
81,00:05:19.04,00:05:19.04,very well. And I have a few special holes
82,00:05:22.08,00:05:22.08,in the coral that I like to visit.
83,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,So I can catch ten fish easily within an hour or so.
84,00:05:29.92,00:05:29.92,">> Oh, baby! You got him!"
85,00:05:32.25,00:05:32.25,Yeah. Look at the size of that.
86,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,>> Ozzy can hold his breath for two and a half minutes or
87,00:05:39.08,00:05:39.08,something crazy like that. The kid's like an otter or
88,00:05:42.54,00:05:42.54,"something. I mean, he's a great fisherman."
89,00:05:44.46,00:05:44.46,He's proven that time and again. We need his strength for the
90,00:05:48.04,00:05:48.04,"group to move forward. But as an individual threat, he"
91,00:05:51.25,00:05:51.25,is the biggest threat. Certainly if the merge were to
92,00:05:55.29,00:05:55.29,"happen today, I wouldn't want him around, because Ozzy as an"
93,00:05:58.79,00:05:58.79,"individual is a very, very strong player."
94,00:06:07.21,00:06:07.21,">> Oh, please be good to us, tree mail."
95,00:06:09.50,00:06:09.50,Ahh! Ah.
96,00:06:12.33,00:06:12.33,It's a mast. It's a sail.
97,00:06:15.12,00:06:15.12,">> Tree mail. >> All right, guys, gather"
98,00:06:17.58,00:06:17.58,"round. ""This head-to-head match needs a"
99,00:06:20.50,00:06:20.50,"well-balanced team. To win your first feast, you"
100,00:06:25.04,00:06:25.04,will kick and you will scream.
101,00:06:28.92,00:06:28.92,"To win your first feast you will kick and you will scream."""
102,00:06:32.08,00:06:32.08,It doesn't say anything about immunity.
103,00:06:33.92,00:06:33.92,I wonder... >> I believe we should bring
104,00:06:38.08,00:06:38.08,him. I'm the priest.
105,00:06:39.29,00:06:39.29,I like to carry him. I feel like I'm holy.
106,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,I should bring it. >> I would prefer not to have
107,00:06:42.67,00:06:42.67,it. >> I would bring the immunity
108,00:06:46.25,00:06:46.25,"idol with us at all time, every challenge."
109,00:06:48.25,00:06:48.25,We should bring him. I believe Atangaroa is the ocean
110,00:06:50.58,00:06:50.58,"god of fertility, and he came to us an immunity idol."
111,00:06:54.25,00:06:54.25,"He's our extra member. >> You're saying, like, that's"
112,00:06:57.71,00:06:57.71,your spirituality. >> It means something to me.
113,00:06:59.71,00:06:59.71,"It would mean nothing to you, I would carry it."
114,00:07:04.00,00:07:04.00,">> Yeah, but it means something else to me."
115,00:07:06.08,00:07:06.08,It means that when we bring the immunity idol to a reward
116,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,challenge that we're sticking it in their face.
117,00:07:13.46,00:07:13.46,">> I know that you don't, so I respect that."
118,00:07:15.50,00:07:15.50,"But since we're a team, let's at least get everybody's opinion."
119,00:07:18.12,00:07:18.12,>> Have it your way. It's less of a burden for me to
120,00:07:20.00,00:07:20.00,carry. I don't need to argue.
121,00:07:21.88,00:07:21.88,"Hell with it. >> Cao Boi, you know, he is"
122,00:07:25.04,00:07:25.04,rubbing some people the wrong way.
123,00:07:27.04,00:07:27.04,He does have to get talked out of a tree once in a while.
124,00:07:29.04,00:07:29.04,"You know, and nobody really spoke up except me."
125,00:07:32.08,00:07:32.08,"Do you understand where I'm coming from, Cao Boi, or where I"
126,00:07:34.12,00:07:34.12,think most of us are coming from?
127,00:07:35.71,00:07:35.71,">> That's fine. We're good sportsmen, and we"
128,00:07:37.17,00:07:37.17,"play, and that's fair. You know, that's the American"
129,00:07:39.00,00:07:39.00,"way. >> Cao Boi, he's gone through a"
130,00:07:41.75,00:07:41.75,lot of things in life. He knows a lot.
131,00:07:45.79,00:07:45.79,At the same time he is very hardheaded.
132,00:07:47.42,00:07:47.42,"I mean, he's just an unpredictable guy."
133,00:07:55.96,00:07:55.96,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. Aitu getting your"
134,00:08:03.46,00:08:03.46,first look at the new Raro tribe.
135,00:08:05.62,00:08:05.62,Stephannie voted out at the last tribal council.
136,00:08:11.00,00:08:11.00,"All right, are you ready to get to today's challenge?"
137,00:08:13.33,00:08:13.33,>> Yes. >> Yeah.
138,00:08:15.25,00:08:15.25,>> PROBST: Today's challenge is physical.
139,00:08:17.67,00:08:17.67,Here's how it works. Each tribe will select three
140,00:08:20.54,00:08:20.54,people. Each of those three will be
141,00:08:23.21,00:08:23.21,"stationed at their own post. On my go, two members of the"
142,00:08:26.83,00:08:26.83,other tribe will race out and attempt to physically remove you
143,00:08:31.83,00:08:31.83,from your post and drag you through the sand to their finish
144,00:08:36.00,00:08:36.00,line. Once they have accomplished
145,00:08:38.67,00:08:38.67,"that, two other tribe members will race out and attempt to do"
146,00:08:41.04,00:08:41.04,it with the second person. First tribe to get all three of
147,00:08:44.58,00:08:44.58,the opposing tribe members across their finish line wins
148,00:08:47.83,00:08:47.83,the challenge. Make sense?
149,00:08:50.21,00:08:50.21,>> Mm-hmm. >> Yeah.
150,00:08:52.21,00:08:52.21,>> PROBST: Want to know what you're playing for?
151,00:08:53.75,00:08:53.75,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: It's good news-bad
152,00:08:55.33,00:08:55.33,news. Good news is the winners will
153,00:08:57.29,00:08:57.29,"feast on thick lamb shanks, bread, apple cider."
154,00:09:03.96,00:09:03.96,"Bad news is you will be feasting at tribal council, because, win"
155,00:09:09.83,00:09:09.83,"or lose, both tribes are going to tribal council tonight."
156,00:09:13.83,00:09:13.83,Both tribes will vote somebody out.
157,00:09:18.75,00:09:18.75,Here is how it will work. The winning tribe will go to
158,00:09:21.42,00:09:21.42,tribal council first. You will have your tribal
159,00:09:23.92,00:09:23.92,council and vote somebody out. You will then move to the jury
160,00:09:26.62,00:09:26.62,"section, and you will feast while listening in on the losing"
161,00:09:29.75,00:09:29.75,"tribe's tribal council. >> Oh, my goodness."
162,00:09:33.54,00:09:33.54,">> PROBST: So not only do you get food, you get knowledge of"
163,00:09:36.17,00:09:36.17,what is going on in the other tribe.
164,00:09:38.04,00:09:38.04,Because today's challenge requires equal numbers of men
165,00:09:40.96,00:09:40.96,"and women, Aitu, you have one extra member, you must sit out a"
166,00:09:44.71,00:09:44.71,man. >> It's purely physical.
167,00:09:48.17,00:09:48.17,Do you want to sit out? >> You want to sit me out?
168,00:09:51.46,00:09:51.46,>> PROBST: Who's it going to be? Who's sitting out?
169,00:09:53.33,00:09:53.33,>> Cao Boi. >> Cao Boi.
170,00:09:55.08,00:09:55.08,">> PROBST: All right, Cao Boi, take a seat."
171,00:09:57.00,00:09:57.00,I will give you guys a minute to figure out who is going to be on
172,00:09:58.58,00:09:58.58,"the post, we'll get started. Here we go."
173,00:10:04.58,00:10:04.58,"On the post for Aitu, Candice, Ozzy and Sundra."
174,00:10:09.79,00:10:09.79,"On the post for Raro, Chris Christina, Nate, and Jenny."
175,00:10:13.21,00:10:13.21,Starting with the women. Survivors ready.
176,00:10:16.29,00:10:16.29,Go. You've got to pull them off of
177,00:10:20.21,00:10:20.21,their post and drag them across your finish line.
178,00:10:25.25,00:10:25.25,>> Get her leg. Get her leg.

183,00:10:42.17,00:10:42.17,have Jenny face down now. Candice finally off the post.

194,00:11:15.08,00:11:15.08,>> PROBST: Go! Jonathan and Yul taking on Nate.
195,00:11:20.79,00:11:20.79,Raro still working on their first person.
196,00:11:24.29,00:11:24.29,They've got to get Candice across that line.
197,00:11:28.25,00:11:28.25,"Jonathan and Yul trying to get Nate off that post, but he is"
198,00:11:32.50,00:11:32.50,not making it easy. Candice now on top of Rebecca.
199,00:11:39.00,00:11:39.00,Parvati can't pull them both. Nate doing a great job fighting
200,00:11:47.88,00:11:47.88,"off two guys! >> There you go, there you go."
201,00:11:51.04,00:11:51.04,>> PROBST: Nate making Jonathan and Yul really work.
202,00:11:57.25,00:11:57.25,They're getting closer with Candice.

204,00:12:05.71,00:12:05.71,">> PROBST: Nate's over the line. Go, go!"
205,00:12:09.25,00:12:09.25,"Aitu heading out to for their last opponent, Christina."
206,00:12:12.96,00:12:12.96,Parvati very close with Candice. Got to get her to touch.
207,00:12:15.67,00:12:15.67,"Go! Candice is across, finally."
208,00:12:20.21,00:12:20.21,Aitu with the lead. Raro's got to make up ground.
209,00:12:24.46,00:12:24.46,Adam and Brad going aggressive after Ozzy.
210,00:12:28.67,00:12:28.67,They've got to get Ozzy across that line and work on Sundra.
211,00:12:33.83,00:12:33.83,>> You're choking! Get off my neck!
212,00:12:37.08,00:12:37.08,>> PROBST: No choking! >> Stay away from my neck.
213,00:12:42.83,00:12:42.83,">> PROBST: Watch it, Christina. Be easy."
214,00:12:45.67,00:12:45.67,Ozzy fighting them off as hard as he can.
215,00:12:48.88,00:12:48.88,He's outweighed by a lot. Christina trying to pull
216,00:12:55.00,00:12:55.00,"Jessica's pants off. >> Girls, pick her up."
217,00:12:58.75,00:12:58.75,Move her forward. >> PROBST: Christina making it
218,00:13:01.88,00:13:01.88,"very tough on Jessica and Becky, giving Raro a chance."
219,00:13:06.29,00:13:06.29,"Adam and Brad working Ozzy, getting closer."
220,00:13:09.58,00:13:09.58,Raro getting back in this challenge.
221,00:13:12.29,00:13:12.29,Got to get that foot to touch the line.
222,00:13:15.46,00:13:15.46,"Go, go! Adam, Ozzy, and Brad, worn out."
223,00:13:19.00,00:13:19.00,It comes down to this. Becky and Jessica trying to get
224,00:13:25.08,00:13:25.08,Christina across their line. Parvati and Rebecca trying to
225,00:13:30.42,00:13:30.42,get Sundra off the post. >> Don't look at them!
226,00:13:33.92,00:13:33.92,"Come on! >> Roll, roll, roll, roll!"

231,00:13:49.96,00:13:49.96,something. Becky showing some life.
232,00:13:52.92,00:13:52.92,Parvati and Rebecca still working on Sundra.
233,00:13:56.83,00:13:56.83,They've got her arms free but not her legs.
234,00:13:59.71,00:13:59.71,Becky and Jessica very close. Christina not giving up.
235,00:14:06.00,00:14:06.00,">> Jessica, push her, push her. >> PROBST: Got to get that foot"
236,00:14:12.38,00:14:12.38,on there. Yes!
237,00:14:14.25,00:14:14.25,Aitu wins the challenge. It's over!
238,00:14:25.21,00:14:25.21,"Well, I said it was going to be a physical challenge, and it"
239,00:14:27.46,00:14:27.46,"certainly was. Good effort, I thought, by both"
240,00:14:30.33,00:14:30.33,tribes. Here's now it is going to work
241,00:14:32.92,00:14:32.92,tonight. Aitu will go to tribal council
242,00:14:34.79,00:14:34.79,first. You will vote somebody out.
243,00:14:37.25,00:14:37.25,You will then enjoy your feast while listening in on Raro's
244,00:14:40.12,00:14:40.12,"tribal council, where Raro will vote somebody out."
245,00:14:43.50,00:14:43.50,"In addition, there will be one more surprise revealed tonight."
246,00:14:46.67,00:14:46.67,"See you both at tribal council. Get your stuff, head on out."
247,00:15:11.79,00:15:11.79,>> It was fun but it was crazy. >> I was so proud of the tribe
248,00:15:20.04,00:15:20.04,"today in challenge. Oh, my god."
249,00:15:23.21,00:15:23.21,"We just worked together so beautifully, because it was a"
250,00:15:25.62,00:15:25.62,"physical challenge, and we came together and we did it."
251,00:15:30.12,00:15:30.12,>> It came down to the girls. You guys were way more physical
252,00:15:32.96,00:15:32.96,than them. >> Yeah.
253,00:15:40.96,00:15:40.96,">> Christina, when she is realized she was going to have"
254,00:15:42.88,00:15:42.88,"to budge and I was going to make her, he is started pulling my"
255,00:15:45.21,00:15:45.21,"hair and, you know, ripping my clothes off, you know, so I"
256,00:15:48.62,00:15:48.62,thought that was a little uncalled for.
257,00:15:51.50,00:15:51.50,">> A cop ain't used to getting her ass kicked, you know."
258,00:15:58.12,00:15:58.12,>> We did it. >> We won ourselves our big
259,00:16:01.33,00:16:01.33,feast. It was a great day.
260,00:16:03.29,00:16:03.29,But it was very hard to come back and know that somebody is
261,00:16:05.54,00:16:05.54,"going to be going home, though. >> I had this dream, I was"
262,00:16:30.00,00:16:30.00,dealing with all of these supernatural people with
263,00:16:31.92,00:16:31.92,"supernatural power. And there was a shaman lady,"
264,00:16:35.04,00:16:35.04,like this old lady. And she had all kinds of credit
265,00:16:37.12,00:16:37.12,card applications. And she asked me if I have an
266,00:16:39.42,00:16:39.42,"American Express or Visa, all of this stuff."
267,00:16:43.08,00:16:43.08,"I'm looking at it, and I said ""What do I need it for?"""
268,00:16:45.29,00:16:45.29,"She said, ""Well, you need three of that and three of that."""
269,00:16:49.50,00:16:49.50,And I thought three and three-- that's how you can defeat the
270,00:16:53.21,00:16:53.21,immunity idol. You can flush it out.
271,00:16:57.42,00:16:57.42,"And I woke up and I go, whoa, ""Plan Voodoo."""
272,00:17:06.88,00:17:06.88,>> Cao Boi believes John has the hidden immunity idol.
273,00:17:10.12,00:17:10.12,So Plan Voodoo would split our votes between Jonathan and
274,00:17:13.12,00:17:13.12,"Candice, forcing a three-three tie."
275,00:17:16.46,00:17:16.46,"And if Jonathan has the hidden immunity idol, it would force it"
276,00:17:19.21,00:17:19.21,to be played. And so that way you accomplish
277,00:17:21.67,00:17:21.67,"two goals. One, you get the hidden immunity"
278,00:17:23.71,00:17:23.71,"idol out of Jonathan's hands and, two, you get one of those"
279,00:17:25.79,00:17:25.79,two people to go home. That's very interesting.
280,00:17:32.83,00:17:32.83,>> Think about it. That's the only strategy I could
281,00:17:34.46,00:17:34.46,think of that works. >> That's a very interesting
282,00:17:36.04,00:17:36.04,idea. >> I think the plan is
283,00:17:39.04,00:17:39.04,ingenious. I know that neither John nor
284,00:17:40.88,00:17:40.88,"Candice have the hidden immunity idol, because I have it."
285,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,But it's a great plan to break down Jonathan's alliance with
286,00:17:44.88,00:17:44.88,the members of their original white tribe.
287,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,>> John has been to Exile Island.
288,00:17:52.21,00:17:52.21,Yul and Candice have been to Exile Island.
289,00:17:54.25,00:17:54.25,But Jonathan has been there twice.
290,00:17:56.04,00:17:56.04,He actually had five days and four nights.
291,00:17:58.12,00:17:58.12,"So he has the most time. And if we merge, the Caucasians,"
292,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,they become real strong. If they have five members
293,00:18:05.00,00:18:05.00,"intact, they can knock us all out."
294,00:18:20.25,00:18:20.25,">> We lost the challenge today, and that gets a double whack--"
295,00:18:24.29,00:18:24.29,"not only back to back, but losing the feast."
296,00:18:28.38,00:18:28.38,It hurts. I don't want to talk to anyone.
297,00:18:30.50,00:18:30.50,"But I can't have that attitude. And I said, ""Okay, I'm going to"
298,00:18:32.88,00:18:32.88,get us food. We're going to eat good tonight
299,00:18:34.83,00:18:34.83,"regardless."" Adam I got another one!"
300,00:18:39.04,00:18:39.04,I'll pull its fat ass out. He's a big boy.
301,00:18:43.83,00:18:43.83,Whoa! >> We have to go to tribal
302,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,council tonight. And I'm bummed because I could
303,00:19:00.17,00:19:00.17,"be the next one out of my tribe, especially after last night's"
304,00:19:02.54,00:19:02.54,tribal council. Basically they were saying that
305,00:19:06.04,00:19:06.04,"I'm trying to take control of situations, I'm overbearing."
306,00:19:09.04,00:19:09.04,But I will see what I can do. >> I would definitely give you a
307,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,chance. I'm up for giving anyone a
308,00:19:17.88,00:19:17.88,chance. >> Okay.
309,00:19:22.33,00:19:22.33,Would you give me a chance tonight?
310,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,>> I don't know who I'm voting... I really haven't even
311,00:19:26.00,00:19:26.00,thought about it. >> I will definitely keep
312,00:19:29.54,00:19:29.54,fighting and keep working hard. And if you guys give me a chance
313,00:19:31.96,00:19:31.96,I promise I will not fail you guys.
314,00:19:35.25,00:19:35.25,">> I think my effort in the challenge today helped me out,"
315,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,but I'm bummed because I can be the next one out of my tribe.
316,00:19:42.38,00:19:42.38,I don't know. We'll see what happens.
317,00:19:44.42,00:19:44.42,"I will try to talk to some people, and hopefully it will"
318,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,change some things and hopefully I won't get booted out tonight.
319,00:19:54.25,00:19:54.25,And I'm sorry that we just butted heads.
320,00:19:56.21,00:19:56.21,"And I know that... you know, if I annoyed you I'm very sorry."
321,00:20:05.00,00:20:05.00,But I'm just asking if you just give me one more chance...
322,00:20:07.00,00:20:07.00,>> That's fine with me. I will talk to the guys.
323,00:20:09.88,00:20:09.88,">> Okay, thanks. >> Christina is obviously the"
324,00:20:12.54,00:20:12.54,outsider of the tribe right now. She's kind of tried to get us to
325,00:20:15.38,00:20:15.38,"go against each other, because I'm sure she's going to feel"
326,00:20:17.58,00:20:17.58,like she needs to scramble at this point.
327,00:20:24.58,00:20:24.58,">> I was just like, ""Okay,"" but obviously..."
328,00:20:28.33,00:20:28.33,">> No, don't worry about it. I think we've got a game plan"
329,00:20:31.75,00:20:31.75,and I think we're going to stick to it.
330,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50,>> Christina's the one that's going to be voted off.
331,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,And I don't think that's changed.
332,00:20:38.75,00:20:38.75,">> Oh, my god, you're amazing. Oh, my god."
333,00:20:45.12,00:20:45.12,>> Will you? >> Yeah.
334,00:20:47.08,00:20:47.08,>> And I promise I won't let you down.
335,00:20:48.71,00:20:48.71,">> I got you. >> Okay, thanks."
336,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,>> Of course. >> Christina is close with me.
337,00:20:53.79,00:20:53.79,A lot of good characteristics about her.
338,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,"She is gave it her all today, which is good."
339,00:20:58.12,00:20:58.12,"And that was enough for me to say, ""Maybe, you know, you could"
340,00:21:00.25,00:21:00.25,"be valuable."" >> Adam snaps at her so bad, I"
341,00:21:10.62,00:21:10.62,think she feels like... >> He needs to get some class.
342,00:21:12.92,00:21:12.92,You do not talk to a woman like that in disrespect.
343,00:21:15.21,00:21:15.21,I'm scared that Jenny may be tight with them other Asians on
344,00:21:18.25,00:21:18.25,"the other team. If they merge, and there's three"
345,00:21:20.54,00:21:20.54,"of them, she could cut us up. >> Want me to cut while you"
346,00:21:23.92,00:21:23.92,"pull? >> Whatever, yeah."
347,00:21:26.08,00:21:26.08,You can cut while I pull. >> Okay.
348,00:21:28.25,00:21:28.25,">> If we were going to keep Christina, Jenny would have to"
349,00:21:32.54,00:21:32.54,go. She's a good tough cookie.
350,00:21:35.12,00:21:35.12,I love her. So it's a toss-up.
351,00:21:37.17,00:21:37.17,"Christina's strong, but her mouth's strong."
352,00:21:40.12,00:21:40.12,"Jenny's sweet, but I don't know if I can trust her yet."
353,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,So it would be kind of... you know?
354,00:22:05.62,00:22:05.62,">> Oh, that feels great. Thank you."
355,00:22:19.58,00:22:19.58,>> That's my biggest concern. >> Okay.
356,00:22:21.96,00:22:21.96,>> We did not lose the challenge today.
357,00:22:24.17,00:22:24.17,We won. It was just a twist of the game
358,00:22:26.25,00:22:26.25,that said we had to vote somebody off.
359,00:22:29.46,00:22:29.46,And the consensus is that Cao Boi should go because he is
360,00:22:31.92,00:22:31.92,"pissing people off. Something as simple as, ""I want"
361,00:22:39.38,00:22:39.38,"to take the immunity idol. Well, that's what I believe in."""
362,00:22:41.46,00:22:41.46,"You know, so he is a bit of a wild card, and it's time to vote"
363,00:22:43.83,00:22:43.83,him off. >> You're a J.
364,00:23:00.21,00:23:00.21,>> Cao Boi has this theory that the white alliance is going to
365,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,take over the game so we need to get them out.
366,00:23:07.21,00:23:07.21,"And maybe it's a good idea, because I'm suspicious of"
367,00:23:10.08,00:23:10.08,Jonathan. Maybe it's the way he will say
368,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,"something, maybe the way he will look at somebody."
369,00:23:14.96,00:23:14.96,"And when it smells a little fishy, then you're like, ""Okay,"
370,00:23:17.29,00:23:17.29,"I don't know."" >> I'm in a tight alliance with"
371,00:23:37.21,00:23:37.21,"Becky, Jonathan, Candice, and Sundra."
372,00:23:41.00,00:23:41.00,"Although now I'm not sure. The girls, it's possible they"
373,00:23:42.92,00:23:42.92,might want to vote off Jonathan. For whatever reason he seems to
374,00:23:46.38,00:23:46.38,inspire some level of mistrust among everyone.
375,00:23:49.50,00:23:49.50,"They think he is playing the game very, very hard."
376,00:23:52.08,00:23:52.08,And their suspicion of Jonathan has started to rub off on me a
377,00:23:54.42,00:23:54.42,"little bit myself. I mean, you know, if everyone"
378,00:23:57.96,00:23:57.96,kind of universally holds Jonathan in some degree of
379,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,"suspicion, then it kind of makes me wonder-- maybe I should, too."
380,00:24:10.54,00:24:10.54,>> We're brothers. We've got to remember that.
381,00:24:17.12,00:24:17.12,">> Yeah. >> Ozzy, have you got it?"
382,00:24:19.71,00:24:19.71,>> It's hard to say if Plan Voodoo is a good idea or not.
383,00:24:22.46,00:24:22.46,"There is a lot of chaos in camp, and people don't know who"
384,00:24:25.83,00:24:25.83,they're going to vote for for sure.
385,00:24:29.67,00:24:29.67,"So I'm just trying to play it all by ear as far, you know, my"
386,00:24:32.21,00:24:32.21,gut instincts are concerned. >> I do feel bad that people
387,00:24:46.00,00:24:46.00,have to go. I'd like to try to play the game
388,00:24:48.08,00:24:48.08,with as much integrity and honesty as I can.
389,00:24:50.21,00:24:50.21,"I'm finding it to be very, very complicated, because I feel like"
390,00:24:52.67,00:24:52.67,"people do trust me. But as a result of that, they"
391,00:24:55.38,00:24:55.38,"think I'm in separate alliances with them, and obviously I can't"
392,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,be in alliance with everyone. So for me it's a question of how
393,00:25:00.88,00:25:00.88,"far can you get in this game, and who do I trust?"
394,00:25:14.42,00:25:14.42,">> Relax, we'll be okay. We have plan voodoo in effect."
395,00:25:19.29,00:25:19.29,I believe I can trust Becky and Yul.
396,00:25:22.71,00:25:22.71,"That's gut instinct. They are solid, solid people."
397,00:25:26.12,00:25:26.12,I have the utmost faith in them. >> How's your stomach?
398,00:25:35.25,00:25:35.25,>> You feel totally stressed out.
399,00:25:37.75,00:25:37.75,"Are you stressed out? >> Tonight, if I get voted off,"
400,00:25:43.54,00:25:43.54,I will be shocked. I don't believe that's going to
401,00:25:46.17,00:25:46.17,happen. I've got some pretty tight
402,00:25:48.33,00:25:48.33,"partners. If I'm wrong, then I've been"
403,00:25:50.71,00:25:50.71,"outplayed, and the conspiracy is much bigger than I can picture."
404,00:26:14.21,00:26:14.21,">> PROBST: First things first. Obviously, Cao Boi, you've"
405,00:26:17.17,00:26:17.17,brought the immunity idol. A first.
406,00:26:20.12,00:26:20.12,What's the reason? >> We should bring it since we
407,00:26:22.38,00:26:22.38,"have no more immunity, do we? We're about to vote someone out."
408,00:26:26.00,00:26:26.00,>> PROBST: I haven't asked for it back.
409,00:26:27.79,00:26:27.79,What do you want to do with it? >> He will be another member.
410,00:26:30.83,00:26:30.83,">> PROBST: Ozzy, what is the deal with the idol?"
411,00:26:33.04,00:26:33.04,Because sometimes you bring it to challenges when you don't
412,00:26:35.21,00:26:35.21,need it. Tonight you bring it to tribal
413,00:26:37.21,00:26:37.21,"council when you don't need it. >> It's one of the things that,"
414,00:26:40.17,00:26:40.17,"for example, Cao Boi feels connected to it, and that he"
415,00:26:43.33,00:26:43.33,should bring it. Other people don't care.
416,00:26:45.54,00:26:45.54,And some people feel totally against it.
417,00:26:47.54,00:26:47.54,"So it's just kind of, like, symbolic for other issues within"
418,00:26:50.12,00:26:50.12,"the tribe. >> PROBST: Yul, tell me about"
419,00:26:52.38,00:26:52.38,Cao Boi. >> Cao Boi is a mixture of
420,00:26:55.62,00:26:55.62,"shaman, cheerleader, I mean, fire tender."
421,00:26:59.25,00:26:59.25,He is very loyal in his way. I can't say I fully understand
422,00:27:02.21,00:27:02.21,"him. You know, he has his own"
423,00:27:04.38,00:27:04.38,"perspective on things. >> PROBST: Cao Boi, typically,"
424,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,care you understood by people or are you often misunderstood?
425,00:27:10.96,00:27:10.96,>> Typically in life I'm either hated or I'm loved.
426,00:27:13.96,00:27:13.96,It's one or the other. I am often misunderstood.
427,00:27:17.25,00:27:17.25,"But eventually, if I have the time, a lot of people will come"
428,00:27:19.58,00:27:19.58,"to understand that I mean well. >> PROBST: Yul, are there clear-"
429,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,cut leaders and followers on this tribe?
430,00:27:28.25,00:27:28.25,>> There aren't any designated leaders.
431,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,I think Jonathan and Cao Boi are the most vocal in terms of
432,00:27:32.92,00:27:32.92,stating their opinions. I think Jonathan is what I would
433,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,call sort of a natural leader. I think he is very good about
434,00:27:39.21,00:27:39.21,articulating his positions and thinking for the group.
435,00:27:42.38,00:27:42.38,">> PROBST: Jonathan, is that a fair assessment?"
436,00:27:44.88,00:27:44.88,>> I appreciate him saying that. But it's not like what I say
437,00:27:47.25,00:27:47.25,goes. It's not a role that I assume.
438,00:27:50.00,00:27:50.00,"I mean, I certainly don't patronize these people or talk"
439,00:27:53.00,00:27:53.00,down to them in any way. I don't think I do.
440,00:27:56.17,00:27:56.17,">> PROBST: Ozzy, what do you base a vote on?"
441,00:27:59.29,00:27:59.29,"I know you don't want to get rid of anybody, and the tribe is"
442,00:28:01.71,00:28:01.71,"jelling. >> Man, that's something that"
443,00:28:04.50,00:28:04.50,has been going through my head all afternoon.
444,00:28:07.12,00:28:07.12,"I'm still not quite sure if I've come to a conclusion, and I'm"
445,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,trying to work it out and search my heart and see what it's going
446,00:28:13.08,00:28:13.08,to tell me so that we can all continue on.
447,00:28:15.88,00:28:15.88,">> PROBST: Cao Boi, what do you draw on for your vote?"
448,00:28:19.17,00:28:19.17,"You assess this tribe, you've got to get rid of somebody."
449,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,>> We're looking down the road to the big picture to see what's
450,00:28:25.12,00:28:25.12,going on. It's sort of like a chess game.
451,00:28:27.58,00:28:27.58,"And so the queen is pretty much undefeated on the board, but we"
452,00:28:30.71,00:28:30.71,"want to see if we can expose the queen, find a weakness in the"
453,00:28:33.62,00:28:33.62,"queen. >> PROBST: Okay, I'm confused."
454,00:28:36.21,00:28:36.21,What does the queen represent in this game?
455,00:28:39.83,00:28:39.83,>> The queen represents immunity.
456,00:28:41.92,00:28:41.92,It represents individual immunity.
457,00:28:44.04,00:28:44.04,>> PROBST: So tonight's vote is trying to expose the hidden
458,00:28:46.88,00:28:46.88,immunity idol? >> Yes.
459,00:28:49.33,00:28:49.33,Basically this tribe will walk away and we will see a clearer
460,00:28:52.96,00:28:52.96,picture of what we need to do to continue playing in this game.
461,00:28:56.58,00:28:56.58,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to vote."
462,00:28:59.79,00:28:59.79,If someone has the hidden immunity idol and it turns out
463,00:29:02.54,00:29:02.54,"you need to play it, you would play it after the vote."
464,00:29:06.17,00:29:06.17,"You would then be safe from the vote, and the person with the"
465,00:29:08.75,00:29:08.75,next highest number of votes would go home.
466,00:29:11.12,00:29:11.12,"It is time to vote. Jonathan, you're up."
467,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,>> I think I have to take any wild card out of the game that I
468,00:29:24.54,00:29:24.54,can. Good luck to you.
469,00:29:34.00,00:29:34.00,">> ( whispering ) Sorry, bub. I lost my trust in you."
470,00:29:43.71,00:29:43.71,>> ( whipsering ) I hope we stick with this Voodoo Plan.
471,00:29:46.04,00:29:46.04,Where is the immunity idol? Let's hope it comes out.
472,00:30:07.58,00:30:07.58,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
473,00:30:19.83,00:30:19.83,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
474,00:30:21.96,00:30:21.96,The person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal
475,00:30:24.04,00:30:24.04,council area immediately. I'll read the votes.
476,00:30:27.38,00:30:27.38,"First vote, Cao Boi. Candice."
477,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,"One vote Candice, one vote Cao Boi."
478,00:30:41.17,00:30:41.17,"Jonathan. One vote Jonathan, one vote"
479,00:30:44.58,00:30:44.58,"Candice, one vote Cao Boi. Cao Boi."
480,00:30:50.12,00:30:50.12,Two votes Cao Boi. Cao Boi.
481,00:30:55.67,00:30:55.67,"That's three votes Cao Boi, one vote Candice, one vote Jonathan."
482,00:31:02.62,00:31:02.62,"Sixth person voted out of Survivor: Cook Islands, Cao"
483,00:31:07.17,00:31:07.17,Boi. That's four.
484,00:31:09.25,00:31:09.25,That's enough. Unless you have the hidden
485,00:31:11.08,00:31:11.08,"immunity idol, you need to bring me your torch."
486,00:31:20.92,00:31:20.92,"Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken. Time for you to go."
487,00:31:36.00,00:31:36.00,">> PROBST: Well, the hard part's over."
488,00:31:38.12,00:31:38.12,Now for the fun-- some food and a little eavesdropping.
489,00:31:41.79,00:31:41.79,There's a spot for your torches just off the path.
490,00:31:44.42,00:31:44.42,You can have a seat over in the jury section.
491,00:31:53.04,00:31:53.04,>> It was a wonderful experience.
492,00:31:55.17,00:31:55.17,I had a great time. I didn't make it as far as I
493,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,"planned on going, but that's how it goes."
494,00:32:00.08,00:32:00.08,I did learn I am most vulnerable among the Asian community--
495,00:32:04.67,00:32:04.67,people who are like me but not like me.
496,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,I was aware of them in the beginning.
497,00:32:09.29,00:32:09.29,But eventually I learned to trust them.
498,00:32:11.50,00:32:11.50,I should have known better. >> PROBST: We will now bring in
499,00:32:22.17,00:32:22.17,the Raro tribe for their tribal council.
500,00:32:41.08,00:32:41.08,"Raro, before we get to your tribal council, I owe Aitu some"
501,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,"food. Bread, lamb shanks."
502,00:32:55.33,00:32:55.33,It's heavy and hot. Because I want you to have a
503,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,"civilized meal, some napkins. >> PROBST: Raro, a lot to look"
504,00:33:39.50,00:33:39.50,"at over there. Cao Boi just voted out, and food"
505,00:33:42.58,00:33:42.58,that I know you would love to race over and get a hold of.
506,00:33:46.58,00:33:46.58,"Not really, Adam? >> I don't really like lamb or"
507,00:33:48.88,00:33:48.88,apple cider. I really don't.
508,00:33:51.12,00:33:51.12,"We've got plenty of food at our camp, so that doesn't bother me"
509,00:33:53.17,00:33:53.17,"at all. >> PROBST: Nate, you seem quiet"
510,00:33:56.17,00:33:56.17,"tonight. >> Snap, that smells good over"
511,00:33:58.96,00:33:58.96,there. And I'm not even thinking about
512,00:34:01.42,00:34:01.42,"it, because we had a good octopus dinner."
513,00:34:04.00,00:34:04.00,"So, you know, it's all good, but yeah, this loss was wack today."
514,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,I tried to give it all I had but I guess we didn't have enough as
515,00:34:11.21,00:34:11.21,"a team. >> PROBST: Adam, how frustrating"
516,00:34:14.33,00:34:14.33,is it to lose and lose and lose? You have lost as a tribe 2/3 of
517,00:34:18.17,00:34:18.17,"the challenges now. >> It's extremely frustrating,"
518,00:34:21.71,00:34:21.71,"Jeff. But today, Candice just set the"
519,00:34:23.92,00:34:23.92,tone. And not only did she is get a
520,00:34:26.58,00:34:26.58,"good lead for them, but she wore out Parvati and Rebecca."
521,00:34:30.08,00:34:30.08,"I mean, it's frustrating. But it just ended up that way."
522,00:34:36.21,00:34:36.21,">> PROBST: Brad, one of the things that Raro has always"
523,00:34:39.38,00:34:39.38,prided itself on was its physical strength.
524,00:34:42.92,00:34:42.92,"Well, today you don't match up as well to Aitu, maybe, as you"
525,00:34:46.21,00:34:46.21,thought. >> They may have a stronger team
526,00:34:50.08,00:34:50.08,"pound for pound, maybe. But I think it's not about one"
527,00:34:52.67,00:34:52.67,particular challenge. You should really look at the
528,00:34:55.42,00:34:55.42,bigger picture-- who is working their ass off at camp and who is
529,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,"trying to get along with everyone, who's biting their"
530,00:35:00.75,00:35:00.75,tongue when they want to say something.
531,00:35:03.04,00:35:03.04,">> PROBST: Christina, is there a little feeling of a sinking"
532,00:35:05.42,00:35:05.42,"ship, loss after loss? >> I don't think so."
533,00:35:09.17,00:35:09.17,"You know what? Sometimes when you lose, you"
534,00:35:11.42,00:35:11.42,"lose, you lose. But that doesn't mean you're"
535,00:35:13.21,00:35:13.21,"completely done. I mean, we still have a chance."
536,00:35:15.21,00:35:15.21,"You know, we've just got to keep our heads up high, and it will"
537,00:35:17.04,00:35:17.04,"be our time to shine. >> PROBST: Brad, Christina took"
538,00:35:20.04,00:35:20.04,a little criticism at the last tribal council.
539,00:35:22.33,00:35:22.33,Did you feel badly for her? >> I did.
540,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,"I did feel badly for Christina, because I believe that everyone"
541,00:35:29.04,00:35:29.04,deserves the benefit of the doubt.
542,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,And sometimes things are better left unsaid.
543,00:35:33.17,00:35:33.17,And unfortunately it had to come up in tribal council last night
544,00:35:35.17,00:35:35.17,"in front of everyone. >> PROBST: Jenny, when you got"
545,00:35:39.12,00:35:39.12,"back to camp, what went down? >> Well, she was angry."
546,00:35:43.00,00:35:43.00,"You know, people in our group plain out said, ""You're"
547,00:35:47.00,00:35:47.00,"annoying."" You know, I can understand how"
548,00:35:49.88,00:35:49.88,she felt. I know that it was embarrassing.
549,00:35:52.71,00:35:52.71,It was a shock for her. But the way the feelings were
550,00:35:55.88,00:35:55.88,"with the tribe, I mean, how can you say something and not offend"
551,00:35:58.42,00:35:58.42,"her? >> PROBST: Christina, you didn't"
552,00:36:01.17,00:36:01.17,take it well when you got back to camp.
553,00:36:03.79,00:36:03.79,>> It bothered me because I think they're my friends and I
554,00:36:07.58,00:36:07.58,"let my guard down, I guess. And you know, I don't want to,"
555,00:36:10.12,00:36:10.12,"like, beat a dead horse, but it's definitely a blow."
556,00:36:12.38,00:36:12.38,"And this morning we competed and I felt I gave it my all still,"
557,00:36:16.38,00:36:16.38,whether what happened last night happened.
558,00:36:19.21,00:36:19.21,">> PROBST: Adam, did you feel that from Christina?"
559,00:36:21.50,00:36:21.50,"Today's challenge, did she feel like a unified part of this"
560,00:36:24.79,00:36:24.79,tribe? >> I think she did.
561,00:36:27.08,00:36:27.08,I think she worked really hard during the challenge.
562,00:36:29.08,00:36:29.08,It's not as if she wasn't contributing to the tribe or
563,00:36:31.25,00:36:31.25,"anything like that. It's more of... her personality,"
564,00:36:33.71,00:36:33.71,it just clashes with ours. She can't change that.
565,00:36:37.12,00:36:37.12,"That's just of the way she is. >> PROBST: Nate, this was once a"
566,00:36:40.25,00:36:40.25,"big, happy tribe. It's now dwindling."
567,00:36:43.21,00:36:43.21,You're going to lose another member tonight.
568,00:36:45.21,00:36:45.21,"At a certain point people will start going, ""I've got to look"
569,00:36:47.33,00:36:47.33,"out for myself."" >> Oh, yeah, most def."
570,00:36:50.04,00:36:50.04,"It's survival mode. You know, you're always"
571,00:36:53.12,00:36:53.12,"thinking, like, ""Well, worst case scenario, you know, it"
572,00:36:55.29,00:36:55.29,"comes down to this and that."" You know, you're playing"
573,00:36:57.42,00:36:57.42,scenarios. But I think right now we're kind
574,00:36:59.38,00:36:59.38,of like... we want to be the fourth quarter crew that comes
575,00:37:02.00,00:37:02.00,"back, you know, from behind and just, you know, smokes them out."
576,00:37:04.96,00:37:04.96,">> PROBST: Okay. Before we vote, there's one more"
577,00:37:09.67,00:37:09.67,twist to tonight's tribal council.
578,00:37:12.75,00:37:12.75,"Aitu, you will now kidnap one member from the Raro tribe."
579,00:37:24.00,00:37:24.00,">> What do you mean ""kidnap""? >> PROBST: They will be immune"
580,00:37:26.79,00:37:26.79,from tonight's tribal council. They will come over to your
581,00:37:29.67,00:37:29.67,"side, sit with you. They will have a plate of food."
582,00:37:33.17,00:37:33.17,They will return to camp with you and they will be a part of
583,00:37:37.88,00:37:37.88,your tribe through the next reward challenge.
584,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"Quietly confer, then I'll ask you for the name."
585,00:37:54.38,00:37:54.38,">> PROBST: Aitu, who are you going to kidnap?"
586,00:38:00.50,00:38:00.50,">> Nate. >> PROBST: Nate, grab your"
587,00:38:02.92,00:38:02.92,torch. There's a spot for it down just
588,00:38:05.21,00:38:05.21,off the path. Grab your bag.
589,00:38:15.42,00:38:15.42,">> Welcome, Nate. >> Watch out for sauce."
590,00:38:20.25,00:38:20.25,>> PROBST: I owe you some food. You won't have a lot of time to
591,00:38:22.71,00:38:22.71,"eat it, so dig in. There's your cider."
592,00:38:32.62,00:38:32.62,Okay. Now we get to your vote.
593,00:38:35.04,00:38:35.04,If somebody has the hidden immunity idol and it turns out
594,00:38:37.62,00:38:37.62,"you need to play it, you will present it to me after the vote."
595,00:38:41.21,00:38:41.21,"Jenny, you're up. >> ( whispering ) You're a nice"
596,00:39:03.54,00:39:03.54,"woman, but our tribe is stronger without you."
597,00:39:29.50,00:39:29.50,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
598,00:39:43.71,00:39:43.71,"Before we get to the vote, Aitu, time for you to go."
599,00:39:47.79,00:39:47.79,Grab your torches and head back to camp.
600,00:40:05.25,00:40:05.25,"Let's get to it. Once the votes are read, the"
601,00:40:07.54,00:40:07.54,decision is final. The person voted out will be
602,00:40:09.67,00:40:09.67,asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
603,00:40:12.25,00:40:12.25,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Jenny."
604,00:40:19.67,00:40:19.67,"Christina. One vote Christina, one vote"
605,00:40:23.04,00:40:23.04,Jenny. Jenny.
606,00:40:27.96,00:40:27.96,"Two votes Jenny, one vote Christina."
607,00:40:31.83,00:40:31.83,"Christina. We're tied two votes Christina,"
608,00:40:35.21,00:40:35.21,two votes Jenny. Christina.
609,00:40:39.83,00:40:39.83,"That's three votes Christina, two votes Jenny."
610,00:40:44.38,00:40:44.38,"Seventh person voted out of the Cook Islands, Christina."
611,00:40:50.46,00:40:50.46,"Unless you have the immunity idol, you need to bring me your"
612,00:40:52.67,00:40:52.67,"torch. Christina, the tribe has spoken."
613,00:41:03.25,00:41:03.25,"It's time for you to go. Well, you got rid of J.P."
614,00:41:20.08,00:41:20.08,because you didn't trust him. You got rid of Steph because her
615,00:41:23.46,00:41:23.46,heart wasn't in it. Tonight you got rid of Christina
616,00:41:26.04,00:41:26.04,"because she just didn't fit in. Three votes, three very"
617,00:41:28.88,00:41:28.88,"different reasons. Grab your torches, head back to"
618,00:41:31.67,00:41:31.67,camp. Good night.

624,00:41:54.88,00:41:54.88,>> I would rather be on the same page and know what is going on.
625,00:41:56.75,00:41:56.75,>> Nate causes stress for Aitu. >> I was a little bit uneasy
626,00:41:59.08,00:41:59.08,about the fact that we were having this conversation right
627,00:42:01.25,00:42:01.25,in front of Nate. >> PROBST: Ozzy's stock
628,00:42:05.04,00:42:05.04,"skyrockets. >> Good job, Oz."
629,00:42:08.04,00:42:08.04,>> PROBST: And one exiled Survivor takes a beating.
630,00:42:17.17,00:42:17.17,>> I really enjoyed being on Survivor.
631,00:42:19.62,00:42:19.62,It was a great experience. I was just disappointed I got
632,00:42:22.25,00:42:22.25,voted off so soon. Basically I almost feel like I
633,00:42:25.38,00:42:25.38,was taken advantage of. But you know what?
634,00:42:27.21,00:42:27.21,"I met some really good people, and I met some really awful"
635,00:42:29.04,00:42:29.04,people. But I guess that's part of the
636,00:42:31.00,00:42:31.00,game. But it was just an awesome
637,00:42:33.12,00:42:33.12,experience overall.
