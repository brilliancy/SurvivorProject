41,00:02:10.08,00:02:10.08,And I knew that Christina wasoffended by what had happened
42,00:02:12.12,00:02:12.12,during tribal council.It wasn't intended.
43,00:02:15.08,00:02:15.08,It didn't mean to come out.But Adam responded.
44,00:02:18.71,00:02:18.71,And unfortunately she got herfeelings hurt.
45,00:02:20.92,00:02:20.92,">> You know what's funny, is forthe past few days you guys have"
46,00:02:23.04,00:02:23.04,been kind of rude.And I've noticed it.
47,00:02:25.00,00:02:25.00,"Like, when it comes to passingthings, you snapped at me twice."
48,00:02:27.17,00:02:27.17,>> I said you were annoyingtonight.

51,00:02:32.79,00:02:32.79,">> Talking about passing things,you're like, ""Give me that, give"

55,00:02:40.96,00:02:40.96,>> I have heard Adam snap atChristina and calling her
56,00:02:43.00,00:02:43.00,annoying and I thought that waskind of a little bit of a low
57,00:02:45.08,00:02:45.08,blow.She's used to being in control.
58,00:02:48.88,00:02:48.88,She's not used to people tellingher what to do.
59,00:02:50.58,00:02:50.58,And it's really showing.>> It's your personality.
60,00:02:52.17,00:02:52.17,">> Well, you could have saidsomething to me."
61,00:02:53.96,00:02:53.96,>> Your personality is...>> We have to accept you the way

65,00:03:00.12,00:03:00.12,Christina.>> It's not like you're sitting
66,00:03:01.88,00:03:01.88,around not doing anything and wewant you to change that.
67,00:03:03.62,00:03:03.62,">> You said I annoyed you.>> I mean, it's just the way it"
68,00:03:05.38,00:03:05.38,is.>> I just don't understand.
69,00:03:12.75,00:03:12.75,I never thought that's what theythought of me.
70,00:03:15.25,00:03:15.25,But I'm going to stick my headup high still.
71,00:03:19.08,00:03:19.08,And I have gone through a lot ofstuff.
72,00:03:21.25,00:03:21.25,I have been shot and all of thatstuff.
73,00:03:23.04,00:03:23.04,"I mean, yeah, those aretragedies in my life."
74,00:03:25.08,00:03:25.08,I know survived a lot of otherthings in my life.

76,00:05:07.50,00:05:07.50,"Look at that.One, two, three, four, five more"
77,00:05:11.38,00:05:11.38,of them.Jonathan and I went fishing this
78,00:05:14.04,00:05:14.04,morning.We went out to my same little
79,00:05:17.04,00:05:17.04,spot that I like.I'm getting to know that area
80,00:05:19.04,00:05:19.04,very well.And I have a few special holes
81,00:05:22.08,00:05:22.08,in the coral that I like tovisit.
82,00:05:25.04,00:05:25.04,So I can catch ten fish easilywithin an hour or so.
83,00:05:29.92,00:05:29.92,">> Oh, baby!You got him!"
84,00:05:32.25,00:05:32.25,Yeah.Look at the size of that.
85,00:05:36.75,00:05:36.75,>> Ozzy can hold his breath fortwo and a half minutes or
86,00:05:39.08,00:05:39.08,something crazy like that.The kid's like an otter or
87,00:05:42.54,00:05:42.54,"something.I mean, he's a great fisherman."
88,00:05:44.46,00:05:44.46,He's proven that time and again.We need his strength for the
89,00:05:48.04,00:05:48.04,"group to move forward.But as an individual threat, he"
90,00:05:51.25,00:05:51.25,is the biggest threat.Certainly if the merge were to
91,00:05:55.29,00:05:55.29,"happen today, I wouldn't wanthim around, because Ozzy as an"
92,00:05:58.79,00:05:58.79,"individual is a very, verystrong player."
93,00:06:07.21,00:06:07.21,">> Oh, please be good to us,tree mail."
94,00:06:09.50,00:06:09.50,Ahh!Ah.
95,00:06:12.33,00:06:12.33,It's a mast.It's a sail.

102,00:06:33.92,00:06:33.92,I wonder...>> I believe we should bring
103,00:06:38.08,00:06:38.08,him.I'm the priest.
104,00:06:39.29,00:06:39.29,I like to carry him.I feel like I'm holy.
105,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,I should bring it.>> I would prefer not to have
106,00:06:42.67,00:06:42.67,it.>> I would bring the immunity
107,00:06:46.25,00:06:46.25,"idol with us at all time, everychallenge."
108,00:06:48.25,00:06:48.25,We should bring him.I believe Atangaroa is the ocean
109,00:06:50.58,00:06:50.58,"god of fertility, and he came tous an immunity idol."
110,00:06:54.25,00:06:54.25,"He's our extra member.>> You're saying, like, that's"
111,00:06:57.71,00:06:57.71,your spirituality.>> It means something to me.

113,00:07:04.00,00:07:04.00,">> Yeah, but it means somethingelse to me."
114,00:07:06.08,00:07:06.08,It means that when we bring theimmunity idol to a reward
115,00:07:08.00,00:07:08.00,challenge that we're sticking itin their face.
116,00:07:13.46,00:07:13.46,">> I know that you don't, so Irespect that."
117,00:07:15.50,00:07:15.50,"But since we're a team, let's atleast get everybody's opinion."
118,00:07:18.12,00:07:18.12,>> Have it your way.It's less of a burden for me to
119,00:07:20.00,00:07:20.00,carry.I don't need to argue.
120,00:07:21.88,00:07:21.88,"Hell with it.>> Cao Boi, you know, he is"

250,00:15:30.12,00:15:30.12,>> It came down to the girls.You guys were way more physical
251,00:15:32.96,00:15:32.96,than them.>> Yeah.

255,00:15:48.62,00:15:48.62,thought that was a littleuncalled for.
256,00:15:51.50,00:15:51.50,">> A cop ain't used to gettingher ass kicked, you know."
257,00:15:58.12,00:15:58.12,>> We did it.>> We won ourselves our big

259,00:16:03.29,00:16:03.29,But it was very hard to comeback and know that somebody is
260,00:16:05.54,00:16:05.54,"going to be going home, though.>> I had this dream, I was"
261,00:16:30.00,00:16:30.00,dealing with all of thesesupernatural people with
262,00:16:31.92,00:16:31.92,"supernatural power.And there was a shaman lady,"
263,00:16:35.04,00:16:35.04,like this old lady.And she had all kinds of credit
264,00:16:37.12,00:16:37.12,card applications.And she asked me if I have an
265,00:16:39.42,00:16:39.42,"American Express or Visa, all ofthis stuff."
266,00:16:43.08,00:16:43.08,"I'm looking at it, and I said""What do I need it for?"""
267,00:16:45.29,00:16:45.29,"She said, ""Well, you need threeof that and three of that."""
268,00:16:49.50,00:16:49.50,And I thought three and three--that's how you can defeat the
269,00:16:53.21,00:16:53.21,immunity idol.You can flush it out.
270,00:16:57.42,00:16:57.42,"And I woke up and I go, whoa,""Plan Voodoo."""
271,00:17:06.88,00:17:06.88,>> Cao Boi believes John has thehidden immunity idol.
272,00:17:10.12,00:17:10.12,So Plan Voodoo would split ourvotes between Jonathan and
273,00:17:13.12,00:17:13.12,"Candice, forcing a three-threetie."
274,00:17:16.46,00:17:16.46,"And if Jonathan has the hiddenimmunity idol, it would force it"
275,00:17:19.21,00:17:19.21,to be played.And so that way you accomplish
276,00:17:21.67,00:17:21.67,"two goals.One, you get the hidden immunity"
277,00:17:23.71,00:17:23.71,"idol out of Jonathan's handsand, two, you get one of those"
278,00:17:25.79,00:17:25.79,two people to go home.That's very interesting.
279,00:17:32.83,00:17:32.83,>> Think about it.That's the only strategy I could
280,00:17:34.46,00:17:34.46,think of that works.>> That's a very interesting
281,00:17:36.04,00:17:36.04,idea.>> I think the plan is
282,00:17:39.04,00:17:39.04,ingenious.I know that neither John nor
283,00:17:40.88,00:17:40.88,"Candice have the hidden immunityidol, because I have it."
284,00:17:42.83,00:17:42.83,But it's a great plan to breakdown Jonathan's alliance with
285,00:17:44.88,00:17:44.88,the members of their originalwhite tribe.
286,00:17:50.12,00:17:50.12,>> John has been to ExileIsland.
287,00:17:52.21,00:17:52.21,Yul and Candice have been toExile Island.
288,00:17:54.25,00:17:54.25,But Jonathan has been theretwice.
289,00:17:56.04,00:17:56.04,He actually had five days andfour nights.
290,00:17:58.12,00:17:58.12,"So he has the most time.And if we merge, the Caucasians,"
291,00:18:01.58,00:18:01.58,they become real strong.If they have five members
292,00:18:05.00,00:18:05.00,"intact, they can knock us allout."
293,00:18:20.25,00:18:20.25,">> We lost the challenge today,and that gets a double whack--"
294,00:18:24.29,00:18:24.29,"not only back to back, butlosing the feast."
295,00:18:28.38,00:18:28.38,It hurts.I don't want to talk to anyone.
296,00:18:30.50,00:18:30.50,"But I can't have that attitude.And I said, ""Okay, I'm going to"
297,00:18:32.88,00:18:32.88,get us food.We're going to eat good tonight
298,00:18:34.83,00:18:34.83,"regardless.""Adam I got another one!"
299,00:18:39.04,00:18:39.04,I'll pull its fat ass out.He's a big boy.
300,00:18:43.83,00:18:43.83,Whoa!>> We have to go to tribal
301,00:18:58.25,00:18:58.25,council tonight.And I'm bummed because I could

303,00:19:02.54,00:19:02.54,tribal council.Basically they were saying that
304,00:19:06.04,00:19:06.04,"I'm trying to take control ofsituations, I'm overbearing."
305,00:19:09.04,00:19:09.04,But I will see what I can do.>> I would definitely give you a
306,00:19:16.04,00:19:16.04,chance.I'm up for giving anyone a
307,00:19:17.88,00:19:17.88,chance.>> Okay.
308,00:19:22.33,00:19:22.33,Would you give me a chancetonight?
309,00:19:24.25,00:19:24.25,>> I don't know who I'mvoting... I really haven't even
310,00:19:26.00,00:19:26.00,thought about it.>> I will definitely keep
311,00:19:29.54,00:19:29.54,fighting and keep working hard.And if you guys give me a chance
312,00:19:31.96,00:19:31.96,I promise I will not fail youguys.

314,00:19:39.04,00:19:39.04,but I'm bummed because I can bethe next one out of my tribe.
315,00:19:42.38,00:19:42.38,I don't know.We'll see what happens.
316,00:19:44.42,00:19:44.42,"I will try to talk to somepeople, and hopefully it will"
317,00:19:46.25,00:19:46.25,change some things and hopefullyI won't get booted out tonight.
318,00:19:54.25,00:19:54.25,And I'm sorry that we justbutted heads.
319,00:19:56.21,00:19:56.21,"And I know that... you know, ifI annoyed you I'm very sorry."
320,00:20:05.00,00:20:05.00,But I'm just asking if you justgive me one more chance...
321,00:20:07.00,00:20:07.00,>> That's fine with me.I will talk to the guys.
322,00:20:09.88,00:20:09.88,">> Okay, thanks.>> Christina is obviously the"
323,00:20:12.54,00:20:12.54,outsider of the tribe right now.She's kind of tried to get us to
324,00:20:15.38,00:20:15.38,"go against each other, becauseI'm sure she's going to feel"
325,00:20:17.58,00:20:17.58,like she needs to scramble atthis point.
326,00:20:24.58,00:20:24.58,">> I was just like, ""Okay,"" butobviously..."
327,00:20:28.33,00:20:28.33,">> No, don't worry about it.I think we've got a game plan"
328,00:20:31.75,00:20:31.75,and I think we're going to stickto it.
329,00:20:33.50,00:20:33.50,>> Christina's the one that'sgoing to be voted off.
330,00:20:35.50,00:20:35.50,And I don't think that'schanged.

334,00:20:48.71,00:20:48.71,">> I got you.>> Okay, thanks."
335,00:20:50.33,00:20:50.33,>> Of course.>> Christina is close with me.
336,00:20:53.79,00:20:53.79,A lot of good characteristicsabout her.
337,00:20:56.08,00:20:56.08,"She is gave it her all today,which is good."
338,00:20:58.12,00:20:58.12,"And that was enough for me tosay, ""Maybe, you know, you could"

340,00:21:10.62,00:21:10.62,think she feels like...>> He needs to get some class.
341,00:21:12.92,00:21:12.92,You do not talk to a woman likethat in disrespect.
342,00:21:15.21,00:21:15.21,I'm scared that Jenny may betight with them other Asians on
343,00:21:18.25,00:21:18.25,"the other team.If they merge, and there's three"
344,00:21:20.54,00:21:20.54,"of them, she could cut us up.>> Want me to cut while you"
345,00:21:23.92,00:21:23.92,"pull?>> Whatever, yeah."
346,00:21:26.08,00:21:26.08,You can cut while I pull.>> Okay.
347,00:21:28.25,00:21:28.25,">> If we were going to keepChristina, Jenny would have to"
348,00:21:32.54,00:21:32.54,go.She's a good tough cookie.
349,00:21:35.12,00:21:35.12,I love her.So it's a toss-up.
350,00:21:37.17,00:21:37.17,"Christina's strong, but hermouth's strong."
351,00:21:40.12,00:21:40.12,"Jenny's sweet, but I don't knowif I can trust her yet."
352,00:21:42.67,00:21:42.67,So it would be kind of... youknow?
353,00:22:05.62,00:22:05.62,">> Oh, that feels great.Thank you."
354,00:22:19.58,00:22:19.58,>> That's my biggest concern.>> Okay.
355,00:22:21.96,00:22:21.96,>> We did not lose the challengetoday.
356,00:22:24.17,00:22:24.17,We won.It was just a twist of the game
357,00:22:26.25,00:22:26.25,that said we had to votesomebody off.
358,00:22:29.46,00:22:29.46,And the consensus is that CaoBoi should go because he is
359,00:22:31.92,00:22:31.92,"pissing people off.Something as simple as, ""I want"
360,00:22:39.38,00:22:39.38,"to take the immunity idol.Well, that's what I believe in."""
361,00:22:41.46,00:22:41.46,"You know, so he is a bit of awild card, and it's time to vote"
362,00:22:43.83,00:22:43.83,him off.>> You're a J.
363,00:23:00.21,00:23:00.21,>> Cao Boi has this theory thatthe white alliance is going to
364,00:23:03.17,00:23:03.17,take over the game so we need toget them out.
365,00:23:07.21,00:23:07.21,"And maybe it's a good idea,because I'm suspicious of"
366,00:23:10.08,00:23:10.08,Jonathan.Maybe it's the way he will say
367,00:23:12.33,00:23:12.33,"something, maybe the way he willlook at somebody."
368,00:23:14.96,00:23:14.96,"And when it smells a littlefishy, then you're like, ""Okay,"
369,00:23:17.29,00:23:17.29,"I don't know."">> I'm in a tight alliance with"
370,00:23:37.21,00:23:37.21,"Becky, Jonathan, Candice, andSundra."
371,00:23:41.00,00:23:41.00,"Although now I'm not sure.The girls, it's possible they"
372,00:23:42.92,00:23:42.92,might want to vote off Jonathan.For whatever reason he seems to
373,00:23:46.38,00:23:46.38,inspire some level of mistrustamong everyone.
374,00:23:49.50,00:23:49.50,"They think he is playing thegame very, very hard."
375,00:23:52.08,00:23:52.08,And their suspicion of Jonathanhas started to rub off on me a
376,00:23:54.42,00:23:54.42,"little bit myself.I mean, you know, if everyone"
377,00:23:57.96,00:23:57.96,kind of universally holdsJonathan in some degree of
378,00:24:00.12,00:24:00.12,"suspicion, then it kind of makesme wonder-- maybe I should, too."
379,00:24:10.54,00:24:10.54,>> We're brothers.We've got to remember that.
380,00:24:17.12,00:24:17.12,">> Yeah.>> Ozzy, have you got it?"
381,00:24:19.71,00:24:19.71,>> It's hard to say if PlanVoodoo is a good idea or not.
382,00:24:22.46,00:24:22.46,"There is a lot of chaos in camp,and people don't know who"
383,00:24:25.83,00:24:25.83,they're going to vote for forsure.
384,00:24:29.67,00:24:29.67,"So I'm just trying to play itall by ear as far, you know, my"
385,00:24:32.21,00:24:32.21,gut instincts are concerned.>> I do feel bad that people
386,00:24:46.00,00:24:46.00,have to go.I'd like to try to play the game
387,00:24:48.08,00:24:48.08,with as much integrity andhonesty as I can.
388,00:24:50.21,00:24:50.21,"I'm finding it to be very, verycomplicated, because I feel like"
389,00:24:52.67,00:24:52.67,"people do trust me.But as a result of that, they"
390,00:24:55.38,00:24:55.38,"think I'm in separate allianceswith them, and obviously I can't"
391,00:24:58.17,00:24:58.17,be in alliance with everyone.So for me it's a question of how
392,00:25:00.88,00:25:00.88,"far can you get in this game,and who do I trust?"
393,00:25:14.42,00:25:14.42,">> Relax, we'll be okay.We have plan voodoo in effect."
394,00:25:19.29,00:25:19.29,I believe I can trust Becky andYul.
395,00:25:22.71,00:25:22.71,"That's gut instinct.They are solid, solid people."
396,00:25:26.12,00:25:26.12,I have the utmost faith in them.>> How's your stomach?
397,00:25:35.25,00:25:35.25,>> You feel totally stressedout.
398,00:25:37.75,00:25:37.75,"Are you stressed out?>> Tonight, if I get voted off,"
399,00:25:43.54,00:25:43.54,I will be shocked.I don't believe that's going to
400,00:25:46.17,00:25:46.17,happen.I've got some pretty tight
401,00:25:48.33,00:25:48.33,"partners.If I'm wrong, then I've been"
402,00:25:50.71,00:25:50.71,"outplayed, and the conspiracy ismuch bigger than I can picture."
403,00:26:14.21,00:26:14.21,">> PROBST: First things first.Obviously, Cao Boi, you've"
404,00:26:17.17,00:26:17.17,brought the immunity idol.A first.
405,00:26:20.12,00:26:20.12,What's the reason?>> We should bring it since we
406,00:26:22.38,00:26:22.38,"have no more immunity, do we?We're about to vote someone out."
407,00:26:26.00,00:26:26.00,>> PROBST: I haven't asked forit back.
408,00:26:27.79,00:26:27.79,What do you want to do with it?>> He will be another member.
409,00:26:30.83,00:26:30.83,">> PROBST: Ozzy, what is thedeal with the idol?"
410,00:26:33.04,00:26:33.04,Because sometimes you bring itto challenges when you don't
411,00:26:35.21,00:26:35.21,need it.Tonight you bring it to tribal
412,00:26:37.21,00:26:37.21,"council when you don't need it.>> It's one of the things that,"
413,00:26:40.17,00:26:40.17,"for example, Cao Boi feelsconnected to it, and that he"
414,00:26:43.33,00:26:43.33,should bring it.Other people don't care.
415,00:26:45.54,00:26:45.54,And some people feel totallyagainst it.
416,00:26:47.54,00:26:47.54,"So it's just kind of, like,symbolic for other issues within"
417,00:26:50.12,00:26:50.12,"the tribe.>> PROBST: Yul, tell me about"
418,00:26:52.38,00:26:52.38,Cao Boi.>> Cao Boi is a mixture of
419,00:26:55.62,00:26:55.62,"shaman, cheerleader, I mean,fire tender."
420,00:26:59.25,00:26:59.25,He is very loyal in his way.I can't say I fully understand
421,00:27:02.21,00:27:02.21,"him.You know, he has his own"
422,00:27:04.38,00:27:04.38,"perspective on things.>> PROBST: Cao Boi, typically,"
423,00:27:07.21,00:27:07.21,care you understood by people orare you often misunderstood?
424,00:27:10.96,00:27:10.96,>> Typically in life I'm eitherhated or I'm loved.
425,00:27:13.96,00:27:13.96,It's one or the other.I am often misunderstood.
426,00:27:17.25,00:27:17.25,"But eventually, if I have thetime, a lot of people will come"
427,00:27:19.58,00:27:19.58,"to understand that I mean well.>> PROBST: Yul, are there clear-"
428,00:27:25.17,00:27:25.17,cut leaders and followers onthis tribe?
429,00:27:28.25,00:27:28.25,>> There aren't any designatedleaders.
430,00:27:30.12,00:27:30.12,I think Jonathan and Cao Boi arethe most vocal in terms of
431,00:27:32.92,00:27:32.92,stating their opinions.I think Jonathan is what I would
432,00:27:36.12,00:27:36.12,call sort of a natural leader.I think he is very good about
433,00:27:39.21,00:27:39.21,articulating his positions andthinking for the group.
434,00:27:42.38,00:27:42.38,">> PROBST: Jonathan, is that afair assessment?"
435,00:27:44.88,00:27:44.88,>> I appreciate him saying that.But it's not like what I say
436,00:27:47.25,00:27:47.25,goes.It's not a role that I assume.
437,00:27:50.00,00:27:50.00,"I mean, I certainly don'tpatronize these people or talk"
438,00:27:53.00,00:27:53.00,down to them in any way.I don't think I do.
439,00:27:56.17,00:27:56.17,">> PROBST: Ozzy, what do youbase a vote on?"
440,00:27:59.29,00:27:59.29,"I know you don't want to get ridof anybody, and the tribe is"
441,00:28:01.71,00:28:01.71,"jelling.>> Man, that's something that"
442,00:28:04.50,00:28:04.50,has been going through my headall afternoon.
443,00:28:07.12,00:28:07.12,"I'm still not quite sure if I'vecome to a conclusion, and I'm"
444,00:28:10.17,00:28:10.17,trying to work it out and searchmy heart and see what it's going
445,00:28:13.08,00:28:13.08,to tell me so that we can allcontinue on.
446,00:28:15.88,00:28:15.88,">> PROBST: Cao Boi, what do youdraw on for your vote?"
447,00:28:19.17,00:28:19.17,"You assess this tribe, you'vegot to get rid of somebody."
448,00:28:22.17,00:28:22.17,>> We're looking down the roadto the big picture to see what's
449,00:28:25.12,00:28:25.12,going on.It's sort of like a chess game.
450,00:28:27.58,00:28:27.58,"And so the queen is pretty muchundefeated on the board, but we"
451,00:28:30.71,00:28:30.71,"want to see if we can expose thequeen, find a weakness in the"
452,00:28:33.62,00:28:33.62,"queen.>> PROBST: Okay, I'm confused."
453,00:28:36.21,00:28:36.21,What does the queen represent inthis game?
454,00:28:39.83,00:28:39.83,>> The queen representsimmunity.
455,00:28:41.92,00:28:41.92,It represents individualimmunity.
456,00:28:44.04,00:28:44.04,>> PROBST: So tonight's vote istrying to expose the hidden
457,00:28:46.88,00:28:46.88,immunity idol?>> Yes.
458,00:28:49.33,00:28:49.33,Basically this tribe will walkaway and we will see a clearer
459,00:28:52.96,00:28:52.96,picture of what we need to do tocontinue playing in this game.
460,00:28:56.58,00:28:56.58,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time tovote."
461,00:28:59.79,00:28:59.79,If someone has the hiddenimmunity idol and it turns out
462,00:29:02.54,00:29:02.54,"you need to play it, you wouldplay it after the vote."
463,00:29:06.17,00:29:06.17,"You would then be safe from thevote, and the person with the"
464,00:29:08.75,00:29:08.75,next highest number of voteswould go home.
465,00:29:11.12,00:29:11.12,"It is time to vote.Jonathan, you're up."
466,00:29:22.46,00:29:22.46,>> I think I have to take anywild card out of the game that I
467,00:29:24.54,00:29:24.54,can.Good luck to you.
468,00:29:34.00,00:29:34.00,">> ( whispering ) Sorry, bub.I lost my trust in you."

472,00:30:19.83,00:30:19.83,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
473,00:30:21.96,00:30:21.96,The person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal
474,00:30:24.04,00:30:24.04,council area immediately.I'll read the votes.
475,00:30:27.38,00:30:27.38,"First vote, Cao Boi.Candice."
476,00:30:35.96,00:30:35.96,"One vote Candice, one vote CaoBoi."

483,00:31:09.25,00:31:09.25,That's enough.Unless you have the hidden
484,00:31:11.08,00:31:11.08,"immunity idol, you need to bringme your torch."
485,00:31:20.92,00:31:20.92,"Cao Boi, the tribe has spoken.Time for you to go."

488,00:31:41.79,00:31:41.79,There's a spot for your torchesjust off the path.
489,00:31:44.42,00:31:44.42,You can have a seat over in thejury section.

491,00:31:55.17,00:31:55.17,I had a great time.I didn't make it as far as I
492,00:31:57.58,00:31:57.58,"planned on going, but that's howit goes."
493,00:32:00.08,00:32:00.08,I did learn I am most vulnerableamong the Asian community--
494,00:32:04.67,00:32:04.67,people who are like me but notlike me.
495,00:32:07.17,00:32:07.17,I was aware of them in thebeginning.
496,00:32:09.29,00:32:09.29,But eventually I learned totrust them.
497,00:32:11.50,00:32:11.50,I should have known better.>> PROBST: We will now bring in
498,00:32:22.17,00:32:22.17,the Raro tribe for their tribalcouncil.
499,00:32:41.08,00:32:41.08,"Raro, before we get to yourtribal council, I owe Aitu some"
500,00:32:43.17,00:32:43.17,"food.Bread, lamb shanks."
501,00:32:55.33,00:32:55.33,It's heavy and hot.Because I want you to have a

512,00:34:04.00,00:34:04.00,"So, you know, it's all good, butyeah, this loss was wack today."
513,00:34:07.75,00:34:07.75,I tried to give it all I had butI guess we didn't have enough as

517,00:34:21.71,00:34:21.71,"Jeff.But today, Candice just set the"

520,00:34:30.08,00:34:30.08,"I mean, it's frustrating.But it just ended up that way."

526,00:34:52.67,00:34:52.67,particular challenge.You should really look at the
527,00:34:55.42,00:34:55.42,bigger picture-- who is workingtheir ass off at camp and who is
528,00:34:58.33,00:34:58.33,"trying to get along witheveryone, who's biting their"
529,00:35:00.75,00:35:00.75,tongue when they want to saysomething.

539,00:35:26.54,00:35:26.54,"I did feel badly for Christina,because I believe that everyone"
540,00:35:29.04,00:35:29.04,deserves the benefit of thedoubt.
541,00:35:31.17,00:35:31.17,And sometimes things are betterleft unsaid.

632,00:42:25.38,00:42:25.38,was taken advantage of.But you know what?

634,00:42:29.04,00:42:29.04,people.But I guess that's part of the
635,00:42:31.00,00:42:31.00,game.But it was just an awesome
636,00:42:33.12,00:42:33.12,experience overall.
