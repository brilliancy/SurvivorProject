251,00:11:45.38,00:11:45.38,MY HUSBAND THINKS I'M GOING TOBE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OFF
252,00:11:48.25,00:11:48.25,BECAUSE HE THINKS I TALK A LOT.
253,00:11:50.25,00:11:50.25,SO I THINK I'M GOING TO BITEMY TONGUE

856,00:36:15.96,00:36:15.96,I KNOW THAT.
857,00:36:17.42,00:36:17.42,BUT I'M NOT A THREAT TO ANYBODYHERE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON
858,00:36:20.67,00:36:20.67,NO JURY'S GOING TO AWARD MEA MILLION BUCKS.
859,00:36:22.29,00:36:22.29,I KNOW THAT.
860,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"I'M NOT HERE FOR THE MONEY,I'M HERE FOR THE ADVENTURE."
861,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,BUT I'LL ONLY BE HERE AS LONG

864,00:36:32.92,00:36:32.92,">> NO WAY, HE'S GOING TO TRYTO WIN THIS THING."
865,00:36:34.92,00:36:34.92,AND I THINK HE CAN WIN THE GAME
866,00:36:36.75,00:36:36.75,"BECAUSE IF HE LEADS SO WELLAND DESERVES TO WIN THE GAME,"
867,00:36:39.54,00:36:39.54,THE JURY'S GOING TO LET HIMWIN THAT GAME.
868,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,">> Jeff: MARTY, JIMMY T.BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT."
869,00:36:44.54,00:36:44.54,"MOST PEOPLE ON ""SURVIVOR""ARE BORN LEADERS."

874,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,SO I THINK THERE'S DIFFERENTWAYS TO LEAD
875,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,AND IT'S MAKING SUREYOU DON'T LEAD
876,00:37:00.62,00:37:00.62,IN THE WAYTHAT GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE.

881,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,>> I MADE AN ALLIANCERIGHT INTO THE GAME

890,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,I WAS VERY BUSY BUT SOME PEOPLETALKED AT THE CAMP
891,00:37:38.08,00:37:38.08,AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKEI GOT A LOT OF THAT.
892,00:37:40.33,00:37:40.33,BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE QUITESURPRISED
893,00:37:42.12,00:37:42.12,IF SOMEONE ASKED MESOME QUESTIONS.
894,00:37:44.62,00:37:44.62,THERE'S NOBODY HERETHAT EVEN KNOWS MY AGE.
895,00:37:46.71,00:37:46.71,NOT ONE PERSON ASKED ME.
896,00:37:47.75,00:37:47.75,>> I ASKED YOU.

906,00:38:05.25,00:38:05.25,SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT THAT'S
907,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,THE QUESTIONTHAT HAS YOU TWEAKED.
908,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,">> OH, IT DOESN'THAVE ME TWEAKED,"

913,00:38:17.67,00:38:17.67,MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEENTALKATIVE AND SHARE EVERYTHING.
914,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,"BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO COME INTALK, TALK, TALK,"
915,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,AND DRIVE PEOPLE CRAZYBECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE

917,00:38:28.12,00:38:28.12,SO I STAYED PRETTY QUIETAND THAT IS NOT ME.
918,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,I HAVE A NICKNAMEOF CHATTER BOX.
919,00:38:33.83,00:38:33.83,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
