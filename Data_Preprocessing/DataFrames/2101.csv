203,00:09:50.00,00:09:50.00,JIMMY?
204,00:09:51.04,00:09:51.04,>> JIMMY J.!
205,00:09:52.21,00:09:52.21,JUST CALL ME JIMMY.
206,00:09:54.58,00:09:54.58,"OH, MAN!"
207,00:09:57.17,00:09:57.17,"ALL THE ADVENTURES I'VE HAD IN THE PAST, I WAS IN CHARGE."
208,00:10:00.58,00:10:00.58,"I CAN FIRE PLAYERS, I COULD RECRUIT PLAYERS,"
209,00:10:03.67,00:10:03.67,I COULD SIGN THEM.
210,00:10:05.17,00:10:05.17,OUT HERE I DON'T HAVE THE CONTROL.
211,00:10:06.83,00:10:06.83,SO WE'VE GOT TO GET THE FLOOR OF THE SHELTER.
212,00:10:09.25,00:10:09.25,MAYBE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO BE INFATUATED WITH ME
213,00:10:11.71,00:10:11.71,BEING HEAD COACH JIMMY JOHNSON SUPERBOWL WINNER.
214,00:10:14.25,00:10:14.25,"WELL, I'LL PLAY ON THAT."
215,00:10:16.08,00:10:16.08,I'LL PLAY SUPERSTAR STATUS.
216,00:10:20.83,00:10:20.83,SOME OF THESE OTHER PLAYERS MAY RESENT THAT.
217,00:10:22.79,00:10:22.79,MAYBE THEY'RE PHILADELPHIA EAGLE FANS
218,00:10:24.00,00:10:24.00,OR WASHINGTON RED SKIN FANS.
219,00:10:25.92,00:10:25.92,>> THAT'S JIMMY JOHNSON.
220,00:10:27.17,00:10:27.17,>> THAT CAN'T BE.
221,00:10:28.08,00:10:28.08,JIMMY JOHNSON WAS THE COACH
222,00:10:30.04,00:10:30.04,OF THE MIAMI DOLPHINS AND DALLAS COWBOYS.
223,00:10:32.29,00:10:32.29,>> THAT'S HIM.
224,00:10:34.00,00:10:34.00,>> SO I'VE GOT TO WORK ON EACH PARTICULAR CONTESTANT
225,00:10:36.21,00:10:36.21,TO WIN THEM OVER BECAUSE IF I DON'T
226,00:10:38.46,00:10:38.46,I'LL BE A TARGET AND THEY'LL VOTE ME OUT EARLY.
227,00:10:43.21,00:10:43.21,>> I REALLY LIKE YOU.
228,00:10:44.62,00:10:44.62,THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU
229,00:10:46.17,00:10:46.17,I GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THAT AND I TRUST YOU.
230,00:10:48.21,00:10:48.21,>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
231,00:10:50.00,00:10:50.00,I AGREE.
232,00:10:51.29,00:10:51.29,>> OKAY.
233,00:10:52.29,00:10:52.29,I'M WITH YOU ALL THE WAY.
234,00:10:54.29,00:10:54.29,>> BACK IN SOUTH DAKOTA COACHING THE SWIM TEAM YOU HAVE TO DEAL
235,00:10:57.67,00:10:57.67,WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES
236,00:11:00.67,00:11:00.67,AND YOU STILL HAVE TO HOLD YOUR COMPOSURE AT THE SAME TIME.
237,00:11:03.58,00:11:03.58,SO I'M A VERY GOOD JUDGE OF PEOPLE.
238,00:11:09.04,00:11:09.04,"THE FIRST TIME I SAW WENDY I TRUSTED HER,"
239,00:11:11.83,00:11:11.83,AND MOST OF THE TIME I DO READ PEOPLE VERY WELL.
240,00:11:15.79,00:11:15.79,YOU GOT MY WORD.
241,00:11:18.88,00:11:18.88,>> HOLLY SAID SHE WANTED TO BE IN AN ALLIANCE WITH ME
242,00:11:21.58,00:11:21.58,"AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS AWESOME,"
243,00:11:23.04,00:11:23.04,BUT I WASN'T EXPECTING IT SO SOON.
244,00:11:25.21,00:11:25.21,I DON'T KNOW IF I'M NAIVE.
245,00:11:27.08,00:11:27.08,MY BROTHER CALLS ME SHELTERED AND THAT'S KIND OF LIKE NAIVE.
246,00:11:30.88,00:11:30.88,I GOT THREE!
247,00:11:32.29,00:11:32.29,THIS IS MY THIRD!
248,00:11:33.92,00:11:33.92,"BEING A GOAT RANCHER, YOU'RE WITH A LOT OF GOATS,"
249,00:11:36.46,00:11:36.46,YOU DON'T MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE.
250,00:11:39.12,00:11:39.12,MY STRATEGY FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME
251,00:11:42.00,00:11:42.00,"IS TAKE BABY STEPS FIRST, NOT BE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OFF."
252,00:11:45.38,00:11:45.38,MY HUSBAND THINKS I'M GOING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON VOTED OFF
253,00:11:48.25,00:11:48.25,BECAUSE HE THINKS I TALK A LOT.
254,00:11:50.25,00:11:50.25,SO I THINK I'M GOING TO BITE MY TONGUE
255,00:11:52.79,00:11:52.79,AND HIDE MY TRUE SELF FROM THE TRIBE MATES.
256,00:11:57.29,00:11:57.29,">> WENDY JO, WHERE ARE YOU FROM?"
257,00:11:59.92,00:11:59.92,>> FROM MONTANA.
258,00:12:01.58,00:12:01.58,>> AND YOU LIKE HORSES?
259,00:12:03.29,00:12:03.29,>> I DO!
260,00:12:05.25,00:12:05.25,>> SHE'S A LITTLE WEIRD.
261,00:12:09.00,00:12:09.00,>> WE GOT FIRE NOW.
262,00:12:11.12,00:12:11.12,>> HUH?
263,00:12:12.25,00:12:12.25,>> WE'LL HAVE FIRE NOW.
264,00:12:13.29,00:12:13.29,>> OKAY.
265,00:12:14.29,00:12:14.29,"OH, YEAH, YOU GOT THAT."
266,00:12:15.92,00:12:15.92,>> I CAN DO IT.
267,00:12:17.25,00:12:17.25,WHO'S GOT THE GLASSES?
268,00:12:20.21,00:12:20.21,THEY THINK I'M SOME MIDDLE AGED HOUSEWIFE THAT TOOTLES AROUND
269,00:12:25.29,00:12:25.29,"THE HOUSE ALL DAY LONG, THEY ARE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE."
270,00:12:28.42,00:12:28.42,BECAUSE THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT ME.
271,00:12:30.58,00:12:30.58,I NEED TO GET IT REALLY CONCENTRATED
272,00:12:33.21,00:12:33.21,RIGHT ON THAT SMALL SPOT.
273,00:12:34.79,00:12:34.79,I'M 56 YEARS OLD AND I'M THE TYPE OF PERSON
274,00:12:38.25,00:12:38.25,THAT STAYS BUSY ALL THE TIME DOING THINGS.
275,00:12:40.71,00:12:40.71,I JUST DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN'T DO.
276,00:12:43.21,00:12:43.21,WHERE THERE'S SMOKE THERE WILL BE FIRE.
277,00:12:45.79,00:12:45.79,WINNING THE MILLION DOLLARS IS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME
278,00:12:48.58,00:12:48.58,"BECAUSE IT WILL HELP ME PAY OFF MY FARM,"
279,00:12:51.58,00:12:51.58,"AND THE FACT THAT I LOST MY HUSBAND IN '09, IT MEANS I WOULD"
280,00:12:56.71,00:12:56.71,NOT HAVE TO WORK AS HARD AS I DO.
281,00:12:59.42,00:12:59.42,BUT HIS SPIRIT I KNOW IS STILL WITH ME.
282,00:13:02.21,00:13:02.21,AND THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME GOING.
283,00:13:04.71,00:13:04.71,>> THERE YOU GO!
284,00:13:05.92,00:13:05.92,THERE YOU GO!
285,00:13:08.12,00:13:08.12,HERE YOU GO!
286,00:13:09.50,00:13:09.50,FIRE!
287,00:13:11.38,00:13:11.38,(\\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\\)
288,00:13:12.42,00:13:12.42,"KEEP IT GOING, GUYS."
289,00:13:14.21,00:13:14.21,">> JANE, YOU ROCK!"
290,00:13:15.88,00:13:15.88,>> IS THAT FRICTION OR GLASSES?
291,00:13:17.04,00:13:17.04,">> GLASSES, BABY."
292,00:13:18.04,00:13:18.04,">> GLASSES, HONEY."
293,00:13:19.04,00:13:19.04,>> KILLER.
294,00:13:22.25,00:13:22.25,THEY GAVE UP THE MEDALLION AND WHAT DID THEY GET?
295,00:13:25.04,00:13:25.04,JANE STARTED THE FIRE LITERALLY WITHIN HALF AN HOUR.
296,00:13:28.21,00:13:28.21,"THE FACT THAT WE MADE FIRE THAT QUICKLY,"
297,00:13:30.08,00:13:30.08,IT REASSURED US ALL THAT YOU KNOW WHAT?
298,00:13:32.08,00:13:32.08,WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS THING.
299,00:13:33.21,00:13:33.21,ESPADA RULES!
300,00:13:35.21,00:13:35.21,WE'VE GOT JUST AS MUCH GOING FOR US AS THE YOUNG GROUP DOES.
301,00:13:44.62,00:13:44.62,(\\CHEERS AND APPLAUSE\\)
302,00:13:47.08,00:13:47.08,>> HIGH FIVES ALL AROUND.
303,00:13:48.21,00:13:48.21,BENRY.
304,00:13:49.21,00:13:49.21,>> BENRY?
305,00:13:50.21,00:13:50.21,>> NICE TO MEET YOU GUYS.
306,00:13:51.83,00:13:51.83,"THIS GAME THAT'S OLD GUYS VERSUS YOUNG GUYS,"
307,00:13:55.00,00:13:55.00,WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DOMINATE.
308,00:13:57.21,00:13:57.21,"GREAT BEACH, GREAT WAVES, BEAUTIFUL GIRLS."
309,00:14:01.71,00:14:01.71,"DOESN'T GET MUCH BETTER THAN THAT, RIGHT?"
310,00:14:03.58,00:14:03.58,>> DO WE HAVE A MACHETE?
311,00:14:04.67,00:14:04.67,>> WE HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE.
312,00:14:06.00,00:14:06.00,>> WE CAN CATCH RAINWATER AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF.
313,00:14:07.96,00:14:07.96,AS SOON AS WE SAW 30 AND UNDER IT WAS LIKE THESE ARE MY PEOPLE!
314,00:14:11.33,00:14:11.33,THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN.
315,00:14:13.42,00:14:13.42,>> YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'D BE GOOD IN THE WATER.
316,00:14:15.00,00:14:15.00,OR NOT.
317,00:14:16.79,00:14:16.79,OOH!
318,00:14:18.92,00:14:18.92,OW!

320,00:14:23.12,00:14:23.12,">> DAMN, THAT WAS IN THERE!"
321,00:14:26.33,00:14:26.33,">> THE GUY WITH THE LONG BLOND HAIR, HE'S A DUMB BLOND."
322,00:14:29.50,00:14:29.50,"I MEAN, I NEVER REALLY CALLED A GUY"
323,00:14:31.17,00:14:31.17,A DUMB BLOND BEFORE BUT HE'S A DUMB BLOND.
324,00:14:36.25,00:14:36.25,>> OW!

341,00:15:11.92,00:15:11.92,"DUDE, I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY CALL ME."
342,00:15:13.17,00:15:13.17,I'M GONNA WIN THE MILLION DOLLARS
343,00:15:14.71,00:15:14.71,SO I GUESS MY NICK NAME IS FABIO.
344,00:15:17.17,00:15:17.17,TIMBER!
345,00:15:23.29,00:15:23.29,">> OKAY, LOOK, I FEEL THAT ME AND YOU"
346,00:15:25.38,00:15:25.38,WILL BE THE STRONGEST IN CHALLENGES.
347,00:15:26.71,00:15:26.71,WITHOUT ME AND YOU I THINK THEY'RE SCREWED.
348,00:15:28.08,00:15:28.08,>> YOU AND I ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST
349,00:15:29.58,00:15:29.58,AS FAR AS JUST STRENGTH WISE.
350,00:15:31.71,00:15:31.71,WE MAY NOT BE THE BEST SWIMMERS OR SOMETHING.
351,00:15:33.21,00:15:33.21,>> I WON'T BE THE BEST SWIMMER BUT STRENGTH WISE
352,00:15:35.79,00:15:35.79,ANY KIND OF ATHLETIC ABILITY WISE...
353,00:15:37.17,00:15:37.17,>> THAT'S A TARGET ON OUR BACK.
354,00:15:38.96,00:15:38.96,>> YOU'RE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY SEE ALPHA MALES BEING TARGETED.
355,00:15:41.83,00:15:41.83,THAT'S WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT ME AND YOU STICKING DOWN TO NUMBER TWO.
356,00:15:44.50,00:15:44.50,ROB AND RUSSELL COULD HAVE RAN IT LAST YEAR.
357,00:15:47.17,00:15:47.17,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU
358,00:15:48.83,00:15:48.83,BUT I DON'T WANT ANOTHER GIRL TO WIN IT.
359,00:15:50.33,00:15:50.33,>> EXACTLY.
360,00:15:52.12,00:15:52.12,>> IT'S IMPORTANT WE DON'T LET GIRLS TAKE OVER.
361,00:15:53.96,00:15:53.96,WE ALREADY GET OWNED IN MARRIAGE.
362,00:15:55.96,00:15:55.96,PRETTY SOON WE'LL HAVE A WOMAN PRESIDENT.
363,00:15:57.62,00:15:57.62,"I MEAN, A GUY NEEDS TO SACK UP AND WE NEED TO WIN THIS ONE."
364,00:16:06.17,00:16:06.17,">> SO BEING AN AMPUTEE, EVERY TIME I NOTICE PEOPLE LOOKING"
365,00:16:09.58,00:16:09.58,DOWN AT THE GROUND I THOUGHT THEY WERE LOOKING AT MY LEG
366,00:16:11.83,00:16:11.83,AND MY FOOT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT MY PANTS?
367,00:16:13.79,00:16:13.79,I WAS PARANOID THAT PEOPLE WERE JUST STARING AT MY LEG.
368,00:16:17.38,00:16:17.38,I WAS DEFINITELY THINKING THEY
369,00:16:19.42,00:16:19.42,WERE SUSPECTING SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT.
370,00:16:22.17,00:16:22.17,SO I GUESS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO JUST SHOW IT TO EVERYONE
371,00:16:24.38,00:16:24.38,AND SO THAT'S MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I COME OUT WITH IT
372,00:16:27.83,00:16:27.83,AND AM ABLE TO PROVE IMMEDIATELY THAT I AM
373,00:16:30.71,00:16:30.71,AS PHYSICALLY CAPABLE AS EVERYONE ELSE.

375,00:16:35.33,00:16:35.33,>> WHAT'S UP?
376,00:16:36.38,00:16:36.38,>> CAN WE GROUP?
377,00:16:37.38,00:16:37.38,">> GROUP MEETING, GUYS."
378,00:16:38.42,00:16:38.42,>> WE GOT TREE MAIL?
379,00:16:40.12,00:16:40.12,">> NO, NO, I KIND OF CALLED THE GROUP MEETING."
380,00:16:42.12,00:16:42.12,"WE ALREADY HAVE FIRST IMPRESSIONS,"
381,00:16:44.33,00:16:44.33,GOTTEN TO KNOW EACH OTHER SO I THINK AT THIS POINT
382,00:16:47.21,00:16:47.21,"I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE WITH MY TEAM, RIGHT?"
383,00:16:49.33,00:16:49.33,>> RIGHT.
384,00:16:50.92,00:16:50.92,">> WAIT, I'M CONFUSED."
385,00:16:52.92,00:16:52.92,>> WELL...
386,00:16:57.21,00:16:57.21,>> PROSTHETIC.
387,00:16:58.12,00:16:58.12,>> I KNEW IT!
388,00:16:59.12,00:16:59.12,">> I KNEW IT, TOO."
389,00:17:00.50,00:17:00.50,>> OH!
390,00:17:03.75,00:17:03.75,"ALL RIGHT, NOW I AM EXCITED."
391,00:17:05.92,00:17:05.92,(\\LAUGHS\\)
392,00:17:07.08,00:17:07.08,>> WHAT HAPPENED?
393,00:17:08.38,00:17:08.38,>> I HAD A BIRTH DEFECT.
394,00:17:10.04,00:17:10.04,>> YOU ARE A ROCK STAR.
395,00:17:11.08,00:17:11.08,>> ALL RIGHT.
396,00:17:12.08,00:17:12.08,COOL.
397,00:17:14.17,00:17:14.17,>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED ON HOW THOSE THINGS WORK.
398,00:17:15.54,00:17:15.54,HOW DO YOU TELL IT TO MOVE?
399,00:17:17.12,00:17:17.12,(\\LAUGHTER\\)
400,00:17:18.17,00:17:18.17,>> SHE DOES HAVE A THIGH.
401,00:17:19.83,00:17:19.83,>> BEING THAT I'M SUCH A WUSS I COULD ALMOST CRY.

701,00:29:50.21,00:29:50.21,"AND, OF COURSE, WON THE SUPER BOWL."
702,00:29:52.04,00:29:52.04,"LOSING THE FIRST CHALLENGE, IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD."
703,00:29:54.08,00:29:54.08,"JUST MAKE SURE WE MAKE A SMART DECISION,"
704,00:29:55.75,00:29:55.75,GET RID OF THE WEAKEST PLAYER
705,00:29:57.21,00:29:57.21,"AND STILL HAVE THE MEDALLION, STILL HAVE A STRONG TEAM."
706,00:30:17.25,00:30:17.25,>> LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
707,00:30:19.17,00:30:19.17,"I DON'T KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN THINK CLEARLY RIGHT NOW."
708,00:30:21.75,00:30:21.75,I'M JUNKED FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE CHALLENGE.
709,00:30:25.79,00:30:25.79,I NEED TO SLEEP.
710,00:30:27.33,00:30:27.33,I WANT TO LAY DOWN.
711,00:30:29.17,00:30:29.17,"I'M 48 YEARS OLD, BUT THIS PLACE ALREADY KNOCKED ME DOWN,"

713,00:30:34.21,00:30:34.21,SO I'VE GOT TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH THAT
714,00:30:36.17,00:30:36.17,AND I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.
715,00:30:39.17,00:30:39.17,">> JIMMY T., WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?"
716,00:30:41.08,00:30:41.08,">> I THINK JIMMY'S TRYING TO HORN SWAGGLE EVERYBODY,"

720,00:30:50.42,00:30:50.42,I'M JUST...
721,00:30:52.54,00:30:52.54,>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
722,00:30:54.00,00:30:54.00,>> I'VE GOT TO SAY THIS.
723,00:30:55.50,00:30:55.50,I'M NOT GOING TO NOT BE HEARD HERE.
724,00:30:57.08,00:30:57.08,>> OKAY.
725,00:30:58.38,00:30:58.38,>> I'M NOT GOING TO NOT BE HEARD.
726,00:31:00.08,00:31:00.08,">> OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'M LISTENING, I'M LISTENING."
727,00:31:01.17,00:31:01.17,>> ALL RIGHT.
728,00:31:02.12,00:31:02.12,I KNOW...
729,00:31:03.71,00:31:03.71,I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES STARS BLIND PEOPLE.
730,00:31:06.25,00:31:06.25,>> OKAY.
731,00:31:07.25,00:31:07.25,I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU.
732,00:31:08.17,00:31:08.17,>> I'VE GOT TO CALL HIM DOWN.
733,00:31:13.08,00:31:13.08,>> NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO GO HOME.
734,00:31:15.17,00:31:15.17,">> WHOEVER IT IS, YOU KNOW,"
735,00:31:17.21,00:31:17.21,WE ALL GOT TO DECIDE TO TAKE OUT THE WEAKEST PLAYER.
736,00:31:20.33,00:31:20.33,AND THAT MAKES THE TEAM STRONGER.
737,00:31:23.08,00:31:23.08,>> SO WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE WEAKEST PLAYER?
738,00:31:25.92,00:31:25.92,>> I THINK IT'S EITHER MYSELF OR WENDY.
739,00:31:29.54,00:31:29.54,PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S WENDY.
740,00:31:30.92,00:31:30.92,"I MEAN, HOW IS THIS TEAM GOING TO GET STRONGER?"
741,00:31:33.50,00:31:33.50,FORGET ABOUT PERSONALITIES.
742,00:31:34.92,00:31:34.92,FORGET ABOUT ALLIANCES.
743,00:31:36.21,00:31:36.21,>> YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?
744,00:31:38.29,00:31:38.29,>> I REALLY DO.
745,00:31:39.29,00:31:39.29,I MEAN IT.
746,00:31:40.58,00:31:40.58,>> COACH EXPLAINED THAT WE NEED
747,00:31:42.21,00:31:42.21,TO KEEP OUR TEAM STRONGER AND I AGREE WITH HIM.
748,00:31:44.96,00:31:44.96,AND THAT'S SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT
749,00:31:47.17,00:31:47.17,BEFORE I RUSHED INTO THE ALLIANCE WITH WENDY.
750,00:31:50.17,00:31:50.17,>> THIS GAME WE JUST DON'T KNOW.
751,00:31:52.21,00:31:52.21,">> I MEAN, BUT YOU ASK YOURSELF,"
752,00:31:53.38,00:31:53.38,DOES THE TEAM GET STRONGER WITHOUT WENDY?
753,00:31:55.62,00:31:55.62,>> I'M REALLY CAUGHT IN A DILEMMA
754,00:31:57.54,00:31:57.54,BECAUSE I SHOOK HER HAND AND GAVE HER MY WORD.
755,00:32:00.33,00:32:00.33,SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW.
756,00:32:02.46,00:32:02.46,I'M JUST GOING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
757,00:32:03.96,00:32:03.96,">> HERE'S THE QUESTION, THOUGH..."
758,00:32:06.08,00:32:06.08,>> AND THE POT'S NOT GOING TO SET WELL.
759,00:32:07.67,00:32:07.67,>> I LOOK NERVOUS AND CONCERNED
760,00:32:09.62,00:32:09.62,PROBABLY BECAUSE I AM NERVOUS AND CONCERNED.
761,00:32:12.17,00:32:12.17,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'M NERVOUS BUT I'M CONCERNED"
762,00:32:13.92,00:32:13.92,BECAUSE I THINK I'M ON THE OUTS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
763,00:32:17.67,00:32:17.67,I DEVELOPED A BOND WITH A LOT OF THE PEOPLE.
764,00:32:20.46,00:32:20.46,>> YOU GOING TO COME OUT?
765,00:32:21.96,00:32:21.96,">> NO, I'M GOING TO GO BACK UP."
766,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,>> ALL RIGHT.
767,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,"YOU SHOULDN'T TRUST ANYONE IN ""SURVIVOR"" THAT'S TRUE."
768,00:32:27.96,00:32:27.96,HOLLY WON'T EVEN TALK TO ME AND SHE TOLD ME...
769,00:32:30.08,00:32:30.08,WE SHOOK ON AN ALLIANCE THE FIRST DAY.
770,00:32:33.08,00:32:33.08,"SO I'M THINKING HECK, WHAT'S GOING ON IS ALL I WANT TO KNOW."
771,00:32:39.04,00:32:39.04,>> HERE'S WHAT JIMMY SAID TO ME.
772,00:32:40.71,00:32:40.71,HE SAID AT THIS POINT IN THE BALL GAME WE SHOULD FOCUS
773,00:32:44.29,00:32:44.29,ON STRENGTH AND ALLIANCES ARE BROKEN ALL THE TIME.
774,00:32:48.33,00:32:48.33,HE SAID THERE'S TWO WEAK PLAYERS.
775,00:32:50.50,00:32:50.50,>> DID HE INCLUDE HIMSELF IN THAT?
776,00:32:52.04,00:32:52.04,>> YEAH.
777,00:32:53.04,00:32:53.04,>> OKAY.
778,00:32:54.04,00:32:54.04,>> THE OTHER?
779,00:32:55.29,00:32:55.29,>> WENDY.
780,00:32:57.04,00:32:57.04,>> SO WHO DO YOU THINK KEEPS THIS IS TRIBE STRONG?
781,00:33:00.08,00:33:00.08,>> I'M NOT... I DON'T KNOW.
782,00:33:01.96,00:33:01.96,WHAT DO YOU...
783,00:33:03.29,00:33:03.29,I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT WHAT TO THINK.
784,00:33:05.29,00:33:05.29,>> I DON'T THINK EITHER ONE OF THEM IS A BAD CHOICE.
785,00:33:06.75,00:33:06.75,>> UM...
786,00:33:08.50,00:33:08.50,>> WHY DON'T WE GO AROUND THE CIRCLE
787,00:33:10.29,00:33:10.29,AND HONESTLY SAY WHO YOU WOULD RATHER.
788,00:33:12.25,00:33:12.25,DOES THAT SOUND FAIR?
789,00:33:14.29,00:33:14.29,>> YEAH.
790,00:33:15.33,00:33:15.33,>> SOUNDS GOOD.
791,00:33:16.33,00:33:16.33,>> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
792,00:33:17.54,00:33:17.54,>> SOUNDS GOOD.
793,00:33:24.54,00:33:24.54,>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?
794,00:33:27.17,00:33:27.17,>> THIS IS WHAT I THINK.
795,00:33:29.29,00:33:29.29,I'M OF THE OPINION THAT WE NEED TO KEEP THE TRIBE STRONG...
796,00:33:33.17,00:33:33.17,>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE HAD TO REALLY
797,00:33:35.96,00:33:35.96,FEEL EACH OTHER OUT FOR SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT
798,00:33:37.88,00:33:37.88,AS WHO'S GOING TO GO HOME AND YOU TRY TO COAX IT OUT
799,00:33:41.12,00:33:41.12,"OF PEOPLE, YOU'RE GETTING TENTATIVENESS,"
800,00:33:43.54,00:33:43.54,NERVOUSNESS ABOUT ANYBODY SAYING A NAME.
801,00:33:45.42,00:33:45.42,>> SO WHAT DO WE SAY?
802,00:33:46.88,00:33:46.88,I DON'T KNOW?
803,00:33:48.42,00:33:48.42,>> UM...
804,00:33:50.12,00:33:50.12,>> IT COULD BE A REAL TOSS
805,00:33:52.21,00:33:52.21,BETWEEN WENDY JO AND JIMMY JOHNSON.
806,00:33:54.67,00:33:54.67,WE DON'T KNOW HOW EITHER ONE
807,00:33:56.42,00:33:56.42,COULD REALLY PERFORM IN A PHYSICAL CHALLENGE.
808,00:33:58.21,00:33:58.21,WE'RE MAKING SOME HUNCHES HERE.
809,00:34:00.21,00:34:00.21,WE'RE MAKING SOME GUESSES AND WENDY JO PROBABLY DOESN'T
810,00:34:02.75,00:34:02.75,ADD A LOT ON THE PHYSICALITY SIDE OF THE CHALLENGES.
811,00:34:05.62,00:34:05.62,AND I THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE JIMMY JOHNSON
812,00:34:07.46,00:34:07.46,AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THE JURY'S NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU
813,00:34:09.46,00:34:09.46,"THE MILLION DOLLARS, I'M NOT BUYING IT."
814,00:34:11.17,00:34:11.17,IT WILL BE INTERESTING.
815,00:34:13.04,00:34:13.04,WE WILL HAVE TO SEE JUST HOW THIS THING PLAYS OUT.
816,00:34:47.08,00:34:47.08,>> Jeff: BEHIND EACH OF YOU IS A TORCH.
817,00:34:48.54,00:34:48.54,GO AHEAD AND GRAB THE TORCH AND APPROACH THE FLAME.
818,00:34:50.46,00:34:50.46,DIP IT IN AND GET FIRE.
819,00:34:54.46,00:34:54.46,THIS IS PART OF THE RITUAL AT TRIBAL COUNCIL
820,00:34:57.38,00:34:57.38,BECAUSE IN THIS GAME FIRE REPRESENTS YOUR LIFE.
821,00:35:01.21,00:35:01.21,"AS LONG AS YOU HAVE FIRE, YOU'RE STILL IN THE GAME."
822,00:35:03.54,00:35:03.54,"WHEN YOUR FIRE'S GONE, SO ARE YOU."
823,00:35:08.17,00:35:08.17,"WELL, WELCOME TO TRIBAL COUNCIL."
824,00:35:09.62,00:35:09.62,SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FIRST IMPRESSIONS.
825,00:35:12.33,00:35:12.33,"JANE, WHAT IS TYPICALLY THE FIRST IMPRESSION"
826,00:35:14.21,00:35:14.21,PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY MEET YOU?
827,00:35:16.29,00:35:16.29,>> THEY MIGHT CALL ME A SOUTHERN HILLBILLY.
828,00:35:18.17,00:35:18.17,">> I CALL HER ""SURVIVOR"" McGUYVER BECAUSE WITHIN AN HOUR"
829,00:35:20.83,00:35:20.83,OF HITTING THE BEACH JANE HAD THE FIRE GOING.
830,00:35:22.67,00:35:22.67,SHE CAN DO ANYTHING HERE.
831,00:35:24.67,00:35:24.67,">> Jeff: JANE, DID YOU KNOW YOU COULD DO IT?"
832,00:35:26.29,00:35:26.29,">> HELL, YEAH, I KNEW I COULD DO IT."
833,00:35:28.04,00:35:28.04,BECAUSE I SAW AN ARTICLE THAT YOU WROTE AND IT SAID
834,00:35:30.71,00:35:30.71,"""WHY WOULD ANYBODY COME AND PLAY 'SURVIVOR'"
835,00:35:32.71,00:35:32.71,"THAT DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A FIRE?"""
836,00:35:34.62,00:35:34.62,>> Jeff: YOU LISTENED TO SOMETHING I SAID?
837,00:35:36.25,00:35:36.25,">> I TOOK IT TO HEART, TOO,"
838,00:35:37.75,00:35:37.75,BECAUSE I PRACTICED FOR TWO MONTHS.
839,00:35:40.71,00:35:40.71,">> Jeff: JIMMY T., HOW BIG WERE THOSE"
840,00:35:43.17,00:35:43.17,FIRST FEW MOMENTS FOR YOU IN MAKING FIRST IMPRESSIONS?
841,00:35:46.12,00:35:46.12,>> UNBELIEVABLE.
842,00:35:47.62,00:35:47.62,WHERE I DO COME FROM I'M A LEADER.
843,00:35:49.08,00:35:49.08,"WHEN I TALK, PEOPLE LISTEN."
844,00:35:51.29,00:35:51.29,"WHEN YOU GET TO ""SURVIVOR"","
845,00:35:52.92,00:35:52.92,"THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE STRONGER,"
846,00:35:54.21,00:35:54.21,THERE'S PEOPLE WITH MORE INTEGRITY AND WHEN YOU HAVE
847,00:35:56.29,00:35:56.29,ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS IN THE N.F.L.
848,00:35:58.17,00:35:58.17,"OF ALL TIME, IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING."
849,00:36:00.04,00:36:00.04,I'M JUST ANOTHER PLAYER HERE.
850,00:36:01.50,00:36:01.50,">> Jeff: JIMMY, WHEN YOU HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,"
851,00:36:03.50,00:36:03.50,DO YOU FEEL A LITTLE TARGET ON YOUR BACK
852,00:36:05.75,00:36:05.75,THAT PEOPLE WILL EITHER LOOK TO YOU FOR LEADERSHIP
853,00:36:08.25,00:36:08.25,OR BE ANNOYED THAT YOU ARE A LEADER?
854,00:36:10.33,00:36:10.33,">> LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR, I'M NOT THE BOSS."
855,00:36:12.71,00:36:12.71,"BUT, YEAH, I'M GOING TO BE"
856,00:36:14.25,00:36:14.25,A TARGET EVERY SINGLE TRIBAL COUNCIL.
857,00:36:15.96,00:36:15.96,I KNOW THAT.
858,00:36:17.42,00:36:17.42,BUT I'M NOT A THREAT TO ANYBODY HERE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON
859,00:36:20.67,00:36:20.67,NO JURY'S GOING TO AWARD ME A MILLION BUCKS.
860,00:36:22.29,00:36:22.29,I KNOW THAT.
861,00:36:24.17,00:36:24.17,"I'M NOT HERE FOR THE MONEY, I'M HERE FOR THE ADVENTURE."
862,00:36:26.17,00:36:26.17,BUT I'LL ONLY BE HERE AS LONG
863,00:36:28.33,00:36:28.33,AS I CAN HELP THIS TEAM BE SUCCESSFUL.
864,00:36:30.62,00:36:30.62,">> Jeff: JIMMY T, CAN YOU BUY THAT?"
865,00:36:32.92,00:36:32.92,">> NO WAY, HE'S GOING TO TRY TO WIN THIS THING."
866,00:36:34.92,00:36:34.92,AND I THINK HE CAN WIN THE GAME
867,00:36:36.75,00:36:36.75,"BECAUSE IF HE LEADS SO WELL AND DESERVES TO WIN THE GAME,"
868,00:36:39.54,00:36:39.54,THE JURY'S GOING TO LET HIM WIN THAT GAME.
869,00:36:41.88,00:36:41.88,">> Jeff: MARTY, JIMMY T. BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT."
870,00:36:44.54,00:36:44.54,"MOST PEOPLE ON ""SURVIVOR"" ARE BORN LEADERS."
871,00:36:47.54,00:36:47.54,IS THAT A SHOCK FOR YOU TO GET USED TO AS WELL?
872,00:36:50.25,00:36:50.25,>> I THINK COMING INTO IT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
873,00:36:52.71,00:36:52.71,ABOUT BEING OVER-THE-TOP LEADER BECAUSE TYPICALLY
874,00:36:55.25,00:36:55.25,THAT PUTS A TARGET ON YOUR BACK RIGHT AWAY.
875,00:36:57.21,00:36:57.21,SO I THINK THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO LEAD
876,00:36:58.96,00:36:58.96,AND IT'S MAKING SURE YOU DON'T LEAD
877,00:37:00.62,00:37:00.62,IN THE WAY THAT GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE.
878,00:37:02.46,00:37:02.46,>> Jeff: LET'S TALK ABOUT TONIGHT'S VOTE.
879,00:37:04.29,00:37:04.29,WHO HERE BY A SHOW OF HANDS TRULY THINKS THEY'RE IN TROUBLE?
880,00:37:08.50,00:37:08.50,MORE THAN HALF THE TRIBE.
881,00:37:10.42,00:37:10.42,"HOLLY, WHY ARE YOU CONCERNED IT MIGHT BE YOU TONIGHT?"
882,00:37:13.25,00:37:13.25,>> I MADE AN ALLIANCE RIGHT INTO THE GAME
883,00:37:15.83,00:37:15.83,AND COACH CAME OVER TO ME AFTER THE CHALLENGE
884,00:37:18.54,00:37:18.54,AND HE FEELS LIKE THERE'S TWO WEAK LINKS.
885,00:37:20.92,00:37:20.92,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I"
886,00:37:23.08,00:37:23.08,NECESSARILY AGREE WITH WHO HE DECIDES.
887,00:37:25.08,00:37:25.08,SO DEFINITELY.
888,00:37:27.08,00:37:27.08,">> Jeff: WENDY, WHY DO YOU THINK THE TRIBE"
889,00:37:29.42,00:37:29.42,WOULD WANT TO VOTE YOU OUT TONIGHT?
890,00:37:31.25,00:37:31.25,>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CONNECTED VERY WELL WITH THE PEOPLE HERE.
891,00:37:34.50,00:37:34.50,I WAS VERY BUSY BUT SOME PEOPLE TALKED AT THE CAMP
892,00:37:38.08,00:37:38.08,AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I GOT A LOT OF THAT.
893,00:37:40.33,00:37:40.33,BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE QUITE SURPRISED
894,00:37:42.12,00:37:42.12,IF SOMEONE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS.
895,00:37:44.62,00:37:44.62,THERE'S NOBODY HERE THAT EVEN KNOWS MY AGE.
896,00:37:46.71,00:37:46.71,NOT ONE PERSON ASKED ME.
897,00:37:47.75,00:37:47.75,>> I ASKED YOU.
898,00:37:49.08,00:37:49.08,">> NO, YOU DIDN'T."
899,00:37:50.25,00:37:50.25,>> THAT'S ONE QUESTION I NEVER ASK ANYONE.
900,00:37:51.62,00:37:51.62,">> NO, YOU NEVER ASKED ME!"
901,00:37:53.12,00:37:53.12,>> YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK A WOMAN HER AGE.
902,00:37:55.08,00:37:55.08,>> HOW OLD ARE YOU?
903,00:37:56.12,00:37:56.12,>> 48.
904,00:37:57.12,00:37:57.12,>> YOU LOOK SO YOUNG.
905,00:37:58.46,00:37:58.46,">> Jeff: WENDY, TYPICALLY THE ONE QUESTION"
906,00:38:02.25,00:38:02.25,"YOU WOULDN'T ASK A WOMAN IS ""HOW OLD ARE YOU."""
907,00:38:05.25,00:38:05.25,SO IT'S INTERESTING THAT THAT'S
908,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,THE QUESTION THAT HAS YOU TWEAKED.
909,00:38:09.25,00:38:09.25,">> OH, IT DOESN'T HAVE ME TWEAKED,"
910,00:38:10.71,00:38:10.71,I JUST FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT NOBODY ASKED ME.
911,00:38:13.08,00:38:13.08,MAYBE I'LL START TOOTING MY HORN.
912,00:38:15.08,00:38:15.08,(\\LAUGHS\\)
913,00:38:16.21,00:38:16.21,MAYBE THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD DO.
914,00:38:17.67,00:38:17.67,MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKATIVE AND SHARE EVERYTHING.
915,00:38:21.29,00:38:21.29,"BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO COME IN TALK, TALK, TALK,"
916,00:38:23.96,00:38:23.96,AND DRIVE PEOPLE CRAZY BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
917,00:38:26.62,00:38:26.62,WHO TALK ALL THE TIME.
918,00:38:28.12,00:38:28.12,SO I STAYED PRETTY QUIET AND THAT IS NOT ME.
919,00:38:31.21,00:38:31.21,I HAVE A NICKNAME OF CHATTER BOX.
920,00:38:33.83,00:38:33.83,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
921,00:38:35.46,00:38:35.46,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
922,00:38:36.88,00:38:36.88,"JANE, YOU'RE UP."
923,00:38:38.71,00:38:38.71,>> CAN I SAY ONE THING?
924,00:38:44.25,00:38:44.25,">> Jeff: WENDY, YOU HAD SOMETHING ELSE"
925,00:38:46.08,00:38:46.08,YOU WANTED TO SAY?
926,00:38:47.62,00:38:47.62,>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TELL THE GROUP I THINK THERE'S A LOT
927,00:38:48.58,00:38:48.58,"THAT I CAN BRING THROUGH MY STRENGTH, MY LEADERSHIP."
928,00:38:51.62,00:38:51.62,"I COULD BE VERY FRIENDLY, VERY HONEST, VERY FUNNY,"
929,00:38:55.54,00:38:55.54,"FUN TO BE WITH, STRONG WILLED, STRONG PHYSICALLY."
930,00:38:58.54,00:38:58.54,PEOPLE LIKE TO BE MY FRIEND.
931,00:39:01.04,00:39:01.04,PEOPLE LIKE TO BE WITH ME.
932,00:39:03.29,00:39:03.29,THEY TRUST ME ALL THE TIME.
933,00:39:05.29,00:39:05.29,TRUST IS IMPORTANT.
934,00:39:06.96,00:39:06.96,AND I DON'T HAVE ANY BLISTERS ON MY FEET AND THAT'S AN ASSET.
935,00:39:11.25,00:39:11.25,"THAT WILL HELP, JUST A LITTLE THING I'D POINT OUT."
936,00:39:15.17,00:39:15.17,I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT.
937,00:39:17.54,00:39:17.54,>> Jeff: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
938,00:39:19.29,00:39:19.29,YOU GET EVERYTHING OFF YOUR CHEST.
939,00:39:20.83,00:39:20.83,>> THAT'S IT.
940,00:39:22.88,00:39:22.88,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
941,00:39:24.25,00:39:24.25,LET'S GET TO THE VOTE.
942,00:39:25.75,00:39:25.75,"JANE, YOU'RE UP."
943,00:39:55.08,00:39:55.08,>> INITIALLY THE DECISION WAS TOUGH BUT AFTER HEARING
944,00:39:58.25,00:39:58.25,"YOU SPEAK TONIGHT WITH YOUR EXCUSES, IT BECAME EASY."
945,00:40:01.08,00:40:01.08,"WENDY JO, YOU GOTTA GO."
946,00:40:23.38,00:40:23.38,>> Jeff: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
947,00:40:35.75,00:40:35.75,"ONCE THE VOTES ARE READ, THE DECISION IS FINAL."
948,00:40:38.21,00:40:38.21,THE PERSON VOTED OUT WILL BE ASKED
949,00:40:39.54,00:40:39.54,TO LEAVE THE TRIBAL COUNCIL AREA IMMEDIATELY.
950,00:40:41.38,00:40:41.38,I'LL READ THE VOTES.
951,00:40:45.21,00:40:45.21,"FIRST VOTE, WENDY."
952,00:40:49.58,00:40:49.58,EVE.
953,00:40:51.54,00:40:51.54,"THAT'S ONE VOTE EVE, ONE VOTE WENDY."
954,00:40:54.83,00:40:54.83,WENDY.
955,00:40:56.29,00:40:56.29,TWO VOTES WENDY.
956,00:40:58.33,00:40:58.33,WENDY.
957,00:40:59.96,00:40:59.96,THAT'S THREE VOTES WENDY.
958,00:41:02.67,00:41:02.67,"WENDY, THAT'S FOUR VOTES WENDY."
959,00:41:07.83,00:41:07.83,"WENDY, THAT'S FIVE VOTES WENDY, ONE VOTE EVE."
960,00:41:12.67,00:41:12.67,"FIRST PERSON VOTED OUT OF ""SURVIVOR: NICARAGUA,"" WENDY."
961,00:41:16.12,00:41:16.12,"THAT'S SIX, THAT'S ENOUGH."
962,00:41:17.54,00:41:17.54,YOU NEED TO BRING ME YOUR TORCH.
963,00:41:27.17,00:41:27.17,">> Jeff: WENDY, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
964,00:41:31.96,00:41:31.96,TIME FOR YOU TO GO.
965,00:41:42.75,00:41:42.75,">> Jeff: WELL, TONIGHT'S VOTE WAS CLEARLY DESIGNED"
966,00:41:45.17,00:41:45.17,TO IMPROVE THE CHEMISTRY OF THIS TRIBE.
967,00:41:48.17,00:41:48.17,"ONE GOOD THING ABOUT COMING TO TRIBAL COUNCIL,"
968,00:41:50.12,00:41:50.12,YOU WILL LEAVE HERE WITH FIRE.
969,00:41:51.42,00:41:51.42,HERE'S YOUR FLINT.
970,00:41:53.17,00:41:53.17,"GRAB A TORCH, HEAD BACK TO CAMP."
971,00:41:55.42,00:41:55.42,GOOD NIGHT.
972,00:42:11.12,00:42:11.12,">> Jeff: NEXT TIME ON ""SURVIVOR."""
973,00:42:12.12,00:42:12.12,>> FATIGUE MAKES THE MINDS GET WEAK.

975,00:42:15.67,00:42:15.67,LET'S JUST FILL HIS SHOES UP AND THEN...
976,00:42:17.96,00:42:17.96,>> WHY YOU RAISING YOUR VOICE AT ME?
977,00:42:20.21,00:42:20.21,"I CAN GET LOUD, TOO."
978,00:42:22.25,00:42:22.25,I DON'T LIKE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
979,00:42:23.67,00:42:23.67,HE GETS ON MY NERVES.
980,00:42:25.25,00:42:25.25,">> Jeff: 21 SEASONS OF ""SURVIVOR,"""
981,00:42:27.71,00:42:27.71,NEVER HAD AN OPENING QUESTION OPEN THAT MUCH WHOOP ASS.
982,00:42:36.08,00:42:36.08,>> I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR.
983,00:42:38.50,00:42:38.50,AND WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS THIS IS PROBABLY
984,00:42:41.62,00:42:41.62,THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS A LOSER WITH STRANGERS.
985,00:42:44.42,00:42:44.42,I CHANGED COMING INTO THE GAME.
986,00:42:46.96,00:42:46.96,IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN MYSELF IT WOULD HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER.
987,00:42:50.83,00:42:50.83,I WISH I COULD GO BACK.
988,00:42:53.12,00:42:53.12,MAYBE THEY'LL STICK ME ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S TRIBE.
