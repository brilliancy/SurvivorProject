377,00:22:41.96,00:22:41.96,>> So nice to finally talkto you.
378,00:22:44.04,00:22:44.04,>> I know.>> One of my main objectives in
379,00:22:46.71,00:22:46.71,this game was to createinterpersonal relationships as
380,00:22:49.58,00:22:49.58,soon as possible.So when Russell picked me to
381,00:22:52.17,00:22:52.17,"go, I was tickled pink to headover and check out Foa Foa."
382,00:22:55.54,00:22:55.54,">> Shambo, I'm Ben.>> Big Benjamin, what's going"
383,00:22:59.17,00:22:59.17,"on, beefcake?>> Nothing much."
384,00:23:01.33,00:23:01.33,>> Those bright eyes smiling ateverybody all the time.
385,00:23:04.54,00:23:04.54,"There was a lot of chitter-chat.I shared with them, they shared"
386,00:23:07.00,00:23:07.00,"with me.And, it's funny, people here"
387,00:23:10.04,00:23:10.04,"are closer to my own age, theyget me, I get them."
388,00:23:13.12,00:23:13.12,I feel like I have more incommon with this tribe than
389,00:23:15.42,00:23:15.42,people on my tribe.>> They're all younger.
390,00:23:17.96,00:23:17.96,>> They're like 90210.I'm hanging out with 90210 and
391,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,it's absolutely mind-boggling.I don't think it's like life or
392,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"death to, say, get everybodytogether in the morning and go,"
393,00:23:29.21,00:23:29.21,"""Okay, you guys, this is what weneed to accomplish, and as soon"
394,00:23:33.04,00:23:33.04,"as we get it done, the day isyours."""
395,00:23:35.33,00:23:35.33,">> Yeah, we get crab...>> 90210 wanted to do yoga this"
396,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,morning instead of get water.>> Yoga?
397,00:23:40.04,00:23:40.04,>> Really?>> We don't have the luxury of
398,00:23:42.04,00:23:42.04,doing yoga.We're like up the...
399,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,">> I'm sorry, baby.I'm not in the Survivor game"
400,00:23:46.08,00:23:46.08,"to play yoga, okay?>> Of course she's here for a"
401,00:23:49.67,00:23:49.67,"reason, so she's here to findthe immunity idol, I presume,"
402,00:23:53.21,00:23:53.21,and to get information to goback to her tribe which she
403,00:23:56.58,00:23:56.58,claims she's not super tightwith.
404,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67,"But you always have to assumesomeone's lying, always."
405,00:24:04.04,00:24:04.04,>> You guys appreciate me forthe woman I am.
406,00:24:06.58,00:24:06.58,">> Yeah!>> I love you, Shannon."
407,00:24:08.17,00:24:08.17,>> Yoga.>> When I got the note from Jeff
408,00:24:21.21,00:24:21.21,"I thought it was hiddenimmunity idol clues, and I was"
409,00:24:23.83,00:24:23.83,"exactly right.""If you think you need"
410,00:24:28.08,00:24:28.08,"protection and would likeimmunity, look here at Foa Foa"
411,00:24:31.46,00:24:31.46,and bark up the right tree.Clue 2: Within sight of the
412,00:24:37.88,00:24:37.88,"fire and close to the ground,seek the root of the problem"
413,00:24:42.21,00:24:42.21,"and salvation will be found.""Wow."
414,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,I am very excited.There's a hidden immunity idol
415,00:24:51.08,00:24:51.08,at the Foa Foa camp.My tribe is probably going to
416,00:24:53.79,00:24:53.79,try to vote me out sooner orlater anyway.
417,00:24:56.25,00:24:56.25,So this totally rocks.>> Now Shambo has the second
418,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,"note, but I have the immunityidol without any letters or"
419,00:25:06.67,00:25:06.67,anything.I just used my brilliant brain
420,00:25:10.38,00:25:10.38,to figure out where it was.I'm running this whole show
421,00:25:14.00,00:25:14.00,right now.I'm the boss.
422,00:25:28.46,00:25:28.46,"That was, like, such a great...>> We have blankets!"
423,00:25:32.62,00:25:32.62,">> So, to be honest my naturalinclination today was to take"
424,00:25:36.58,00:25:36.58,that camping stuff.But here's the deal-- I'm the
425,00:25:39.67,00:25:39.67,type of man that believes thatyou're supposed to take care of
426,00:25:42.75,00:25:42.75,"your women, all right?I've got a wife and a daughter."
427,00:25:46.46,00:25:46.46,"They're not here.You guys are, all right?"
428,00:25:48.71,00:25:48.71,"Right now, you guys are part ofmy women."
429,00:25:51.17,00:25:51.17,"I got to take care of you,all right?"
430,00:25:52.88,00:25:52.88,"So, guys, I wanted you toknow that."
431,00:25:54.17,00:25:54.17,So we've got a little bit ofwork to do.
432,00:25:56.08,00:25:56.08,Hopefully we can get somegood food...
433,00:25:57.21,00:25:57.21,>> We'll get the bed fixed.How's that?
434,00:25:58.88,00:25:58.88,>> That sounds good.>> After we arrived back at
435,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,camp with our comfort itemsthere was a little monologue
436,00:26:05.71,00:26:05.71,"given by Russell that I thinkto him he sort of felt, like,"
437,00:26:08.92,00:26:08.92,obliged to justify his decision.>> We're having a bed.
438,00:26:14.79,00:26:14.79,">> For crying out loud, howcomfortable are four pillows,"
439,00:26:17.50,00:26:17.50,three beach towels and twowoven palm frond mats going to
440,00:26:21.29,00:26:21.29,make you?You're still going to be
441,00:26:23.08,00:26:23.08,uncomfortable.>> How are those mats feeling?
442,00:26:25.12,00:26:25.12,>> Perfect.>> Come lay down here with me.
443,00:26:28.92,00:26:28.92,>> Russell did not take thetarp and I think that was a bad
444,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,move.I would have sacrificed
445,00:26:33.33,00:26:33.33,everything on that comfort itemlist for the tarp.
446,00:26:36.12,00:26:36.12,Because maybe it won't rain for39 days.
447,00:26:38.67,00:26:38.67,Maybe I'm wrong.But the day it does rain over
448,00:26:40.58,00:26:40.58,"here, every single one of thosecomfort luxury items are going"
449,00:26:44.04,00:26:44.04,to be soaked and all of asudden not so comfortable.
450,00:26:47.04,00:26:47.04,These girls here think thatthis is like Club Med.
451,00:26:49.88,00:26:49.88,"It's not Club Med.>> Oh, yeah!"
452,00:26:53.96,00:26:53.96,>> You did so good out there.>> You did.
453,00:26:56.42,00:26:56.42,>> I'm so proud of you.>> Yeah.
454,00:27:09.21,00:27:09.21,"I mean, it's like this.If it's not, then I'm leaving."
455,00:27:11.04,00:27:11.04,So everybody can make adecision.
456,00:27:17.04,00:27:17.04,I'm just saying.Like I am going to put it out
457,00:27:19.00,00:27:19.00,there like that.That is my ultimatum.
458,00:27:20.50,00:27:20.50,>> That's fine.>> I'm trying to circulate it
459,00:27:21.92,00:27:21.92,that I might just walk away ifBen is here after Tribal
460,00:27:23.67,00:27:23.67,"Council.You know, I have no intention"
461,00:27:26.67,00:27:26.67,"of quitting whatsoever, but I'mwilling to do just about"
462,00:27:28.50,00:27:28.50,anything to get rid of that guyright now.
463,00:27:31.83,00:27:31.83,It's the racist comments.I won't stand here and tolerate
464,00:27:33.79,00:27:33.79,that.I just won't.
465,00:27:35.88,00:27:35.88,">> Natalie, if I get kicked outI'm leaving you my sweater and"
466,00:27:39.12,00:27:39.12,"my tennis shoes, okay?>> Jaison is like it's either"
467,00:27:42.17,00:27:42.17,"me or him.>> No, it's either me or him?"
468,00:27:44.00,00:27:44.00,">> No, no, no.>> I don't know what to think"
469,00:27:55.00,00:27:55.00,anymore.No one understands unless their
470,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,name gets brought up.Ben has some personal thing
471,00:28:00.71,00:28:00.71,against me.And I'm trying as much as
472,00:28:04.25,00:28:04.25,possible to not have meeliminated.
473,00:28:06.79,00:28:06.79,But it's hard.>> Ashley's going home.
474,00:28:13.96,00:28:13.96,>> And who else is on boardwith that?
475,00:28:17.79,00:28:17.79,You?Yeah.
476,00:28:19.88,00:28:19.88,I'm saying...>> All right.
477,00:28:23.08,00:28:23.08,>> So Russell and Liz areadamant about voting Ashley
478,00:28:25.04,00:28:25.04,"out, but that worries mebecause I am definitely loyal"
479,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,"to Jaison.>> Yeah, yeah."
480,00:28:32.33,00:28:32.33,Definitely.>> I like Jaison.
481,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,"Even though, man, he's justnot..."
482,00:28:44.58,00:28:44.58,His mind's getting messed up.>> I know.
483,00:28:46.92,00:28:46.92,>> He's getting broke down.>> He really lets this stuff
484,00:28:48.50,00:28:48.50,"get to him.But I just want you to know,"
485,00:28:50.17,00:28:50.17,"Russell, that, you know, I thinkyou have a good enough vibe from"
486,00:28:55.00,00:28:55.00,"me already that I'm atrustworthy guy, and I'll go by"
487,00:28:58.50,00:28:58.50,"my word, and I will.And if that's my downfall, then"
488,00:29:00.88,00:29:00.88,"so be it.You know, I want to win."
489,00:29:02.79,00:29:02.79,"I'm here to win, too-->> Then give me your word you"
490,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,won't vote for me and we'll letBen go next.
491,00:29:07.42,00:29:07.42,>> All right.After Ashley?
492,00:29:09.21,00:29:09.21,>> After Ashley.>> Look me in the eye.
493,00:29:12.25,00:29:12.25,">> You've got my word.>> All right, done and done."
494,00:29:15.92,00:29:15.92,">> I want Mick to trust me, andI want him to know how"
495,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,important it is that we sticktogether and we can make this
496,00:29:24.54,00:29:24.54,"work.So, I'm going to let him know"
497,00:29:27.12,00:29:27.12,about the hidden immunity idol.The immunity idol is a powerful
498,00:29:31.25,00:29:31.25,"tool, and it is a tool to wherethis person would say, well,"
499,00:29:34.71,00:29:34.71,this guy must really trust me.>> That's some brilliance on
500,00:29:43.50,00:29:43.50,your part.>> My alliance with Mick is
501,00:29:46.25,00:29:46.25,solid.So that's just another vote for
502,00:29:48.25,00:29:48.25,me to get Ashley out.It's simple.
503,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,I was born for this.This is what God made me for.
504,00:30:08.75,00:30:08.75,">> Good job, buddy.You want to start stripping"
505,00:30:10.75,00:30:10.75,them?You know how to do that?
506,00:30:13.12,00:30:13.12,I'm going to show you guyslickety-split.
507,00:30:15.88,00:30:15.88,Get it like this.Go.
508,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,Okay?And then get them like this.
509,00:30:24.17,00:30:24.17,"And then wrap them.And then take the ends, tie it"
510,00:30:27.92,00:30:27.92,"around, tuck it in, and youhave a little poofy torch."
511,00:30:31.21,00:30:31.21,>> Sweet.>> Okay?
512,00:30:33.62,00:30:33.62,>> All right.>> Just like that.
513,00:30:35.08,00:30:35.08,"I've been hooking it up andcooking it up at camp today,"
514,00:30:37.67,00:30:37.67,taught them a few new tricksthat they didn't know.
515,00:30:40.33,00:30:40.33,"So, you know, trying to behelpful and make good"
516,00:30:42.04,00:30:42.04,relationships with these people.But I need to start looking for
517,00:30:47.50,00:30:47.50,hidden immunity idol.I'm going to do a little recon
518,00:30:52.12,00:30:52.12,mission and we'll see what wecan come up with.
519,00:30:54.96,00:30:54.96,"Look at all this goodfirewood, Liz."
520,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,>> Oh.>> Holy cow!
521,00:30:59.71,00:30:59.71,"Oh, dude!>> I love Shambo."
522,00:31:06.46,00:31:06.46,"I wish she were over here.She is so nice, and she's"
523,00:31:09.25,00:31:09.25,bringing a real good energyto us.
524,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,">> Oh, my word, for sure.>> I can't believe no one's"
525,00:31:15.62,00:31:15.62,doing anything at their camp.>> It's amazing.
526,00:31:18.12,00:31:18.12,Who has time to do yoga on thebeach?
527,00:31:20.25,00:31:20.25,>> It's ridiculous.>> My sentiments exactly.
528,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,">> I noticed the girls aretalking a little more, and I"
529,00:31:32.42,00:31:32.42,will regret not sending Ashleyhome because there's no way she
530,00:31:36.21,00:31:36.21,ain't going to try to get thatall-girl thing or something.
531,00:31:39.54,00:31:39.54,We got to put a squash on thatand we got this game under
532,00:31:42.46,00:31:42.46,"control.That's the plan, dude."
533,00:31:47.42,00:31:47.42,I think we got to get ridof her.
534,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,I want to get rid of Ashley.>> What's the problem voting
535,00:31:59.08,00:31:59.08,Ben off tonight?>> I'm on the fence with Ben
536,00:32:01.50,00:32:01.50,right now.>> Why?
537,00:32:03.21,00:32:03.21,>> 'Cause I know that what ifwe do a challenge?
538,00:32:05.38,00:32:05.38,Is he a strong player?>> No.
539,00:32:07.00,00:32:07.00,>> You don't think he'sstronger than...?
540,00:32:12.83,00:32:12.83,">> Okay, let's think about thenumbers, then."
541,00:32:20.42,00:32:20.42,">> I don't like that.>> I don't really like that,"
542,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,either.>> They will gang up on us.
543,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,Don't believe they won't.That's the whole thing.
544,00:32:28.71,00:32:28.71,That's what I do not like.>> Your only concern is the
545,00:32:31.25,00:32:31.25,girls voting us three on three?I'm not worried about that.
546,00:32:36.33,00:32:36.33,Those girls are so weak itwould be suicide if they tried
547,00:32:39.25,00:32:39.25,to pick us off one by one.>> And then we'll get rid
548,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,of Ben.I don't want them to have
549,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,"numbers.You know, right now, it's just"
550,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,"not-- and I know you hate it--.>> I know, man."
551,00:32:54.79,00:32:54.79,>> I'm making my peace at thisTribal Council.
552,00:32:57.67,00:32:57.67,That's the way it's going down.If you guys want to have
553,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,discord in the camp because ofthe guy who does nothing in
554,00:33:04.25,00:33:04.25,challenges and provides verylittle at camp then you go
555,00:33:06.04,00:33:06.04,"right ahead.And if you leave him here,"
556,00:33:07.54,00:33:07.54,that's going to be a roughnight tonight.
557,00:33:08.96,00:33:08.96,That's going to be a rough daytomorrow.
558,00:33:10.25,00:33:10.25,That's going to be a roughnight the next night.
559,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,">> I want to keep Ben around,but everybody's saying how he's"
560,00:33:20.50,00:33:20.50,a poison and this and that.So it's becoming-- I don't want
