13,00:00:33.17,00:00:33.17,I came here to play. >> PROBST: Russell is the first
14,00:00:35.21,00:00:35.21,person in Survivor history to find a hidden immunity idol
15,00:00:38.25,00:00:38.25,without any clues. >> Boo-yah.

31,00:01:19.83,00:01:19.83,thrown out of the challenge yesterday.
32,00:01:21.67,00:01:21.67,Ben would be the right choice to kick out-- he's crazy.

34,00:01:26.38,00:01:26.38,trust him. >> Why didn't you trust me from
35,00:01:28.75,00:01:28.75,the beginning? You're gonna look back on this

37,00:01:33.21,00:01:33.21,"Russell got his way. Ben was spared, and Betsy was"
38,00:01:37.12,00:01:37.12,voted out. 17 are left.
39,00:01:41.42,00:01:41.42,Who will be voted out tonight? >> I did a lot of thinking last
40,00:01:55.04,00:01:55.04,night. What have you been thinking?
41,00:01:57.17,00:01:57.17,>> I've been thinking Ben's got to be the next to go.
42,00:01:59.88,00:01:59.88,">> Tell me why, is that for personal reasons?"
43,00:02:02.33,00:02:02.33,>> The guy's mean. >> I agree with you.
44,00:02:04.62,00:02:04.62,>> I want him out. >> You see how he laid into her?
45,00:02:07.50,00:02:07.50,"I mean, it wasn't just an argument."
46,00:02:09.50,00:02:09.50,"It got really personal and, I think, inappropriate."
47,00:02:11.42,00:02:11.42,">> ""Ghetto trash."" That's not necessary."
48,00:02:13.21,00:02:13.21,">> Totally. Like, that's terrible."
49,00:02:20.29,00:02:20.29,"At the last Tribal Council, Ben was this close from saying"
50,00:02:25.33,00:02:25.33,something to Yasmin that would've made me fly over a
51,00:02:27.50,00:02:27.50,"stool and say... and not even say but, you know, put him down."
52,00:02:33.21,00:02:33.21,"We voted off Betsy, but at this point, Ben is a mental plague on"
53,00:02:38.04,00:02:38.04,our tribe. >> Ashley.
54,00:02:50.08,00:02:50.08,How you feel? >> I feel good.
55,00:02:53.25,00:02:53.25,>> How you feel about last night?
56,00:02:55.25,00:02:55.25,">> It's always brutal, but it was the... I mean, it was the"
57,00:02:59.62,00:02:59.62,"majority, it was the plan, so... >> Do you have any in mind who"
58,00:03:03.62,00:03:03.62,you would want to...? >> Gosh.
59,00:03:12.62,00:03:12.62,>> Nobody here's playing the game.
60,00:03:14.58,00:03:14.58,"Nobody is playing the game but me, on my tribe."
61,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00,Not one person-- it's crazy. >> I think we should definitely
62,00:03:21.71,00:03:21.71,see how today goes before we start discussing...
63,00:03:23.92,00:03:23.92,">> Well, today's just a reward, I hope."
64,00:03:26.71,00:03:26.71,">> Yeah, I don't know what today is."
65,00:03:29.12,00:03:29.12,">> I don't know, this might be the worst group in history, and"
66,00:03:31.83,00:03:31.83,I might be the best. I'm gonna have them all under
67,00:03:34.42,00:03:34.42,control like zombies walking around. Mmm...
68,00:04:45.04,00:04:45.04,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa (birds chirping)
69,00:05:02.04,00:05:02.04,>> Did you put a ton in or just enough to cover the top a little
70,00:05:05.58,00:05:05.58,bit? >> If that doesn't get it
71,00:05:07.67,00:05:07.67,"started, I don't know what the hell will."
72,00:05:09.67,00:05:09.67,>> Just... let me just show you one time.
73,00:05:11.67,00:05:11.67,"Hold it really, really tight... >> Mm-hmm."
74,00:05:14.25,00:05:14.25,>> ...and try to push that spark into there.
75,00:05:16.42,00:05:16.42,You want to try? >> Yeah.
76,00:05:20.12,00:05:20.12,">> Just doing that, though, you're gonna destroy the flint."
77,00:05:22.92,00:05:22.92,>> Yeah? >> Yeah.
78,00:05:24.67,00:05:24.67,"We're almost out of flint, 'cause these people don't know"
79,00:05:26.83,00:05:26.83,what they're doing. I'm the only one that knows how
80,00:05:28.75,00:05:28.75,to start the fire. I think a lot of these people
81,00:05:31.79,00:05:31.79,"out here, they're not used to being out in the woods."
82,00:05:34.92,00:05:34.92,Kind of pansies and... Mick's not an outdoorsy guy like
83,00:05:39.08,00:05:39.08,myself. I wasn't surprised he didn't
84,00:05:40.96,00:05:40.96,know how to do it. I tried to show him and give him
85,00:05:42.33,00:05:42.33,a few tips. Didn't really help.
86,00:05:45.79,00:05:45.79,">> It's usually a little bit easier than this, yeah?"
87,00:05:48.88,00:05:48.88,>> Not with a flint like that. >> Really?
88,00:05:51.21,00:05:51.21,>> Want me to try for a sec? >> Yeah.
89,00:05:54.54,00:05:54.54,">> Without my help, these people will die."
90,00:06:02.79,00:06:02.79,"I save the day once again. >> Oh, you got it going?"
91,00:06:05.46,00:06:05.46,>> Yeah. >> Nice.
92,00:06:11.12,00:06:11.12,>> I started the fire this morning.
93,00:06:13.17,00:06:13.17,Mick was trying to. He was having a lot of
94,00:06:15.25,00:06:15.25,"trouble with it. It's a lot of technique, it's"
95,00:06:17.04,00:06:17.04,"a lot of strength. Like, not to be chauvinistic,"
96,00:06:20.25,00:06:20.25,not to put you girls down-- you won't be able to start the fire
97,00:06:22.83,00:06:22.83,"with the flint. The way it's worn down, it's,"
98,00:06:25.08,00:06:25.08,"like, flat? >> Yeah."
99,00:06:27.17,00:06:27.17,">> If you just try, like, it's gonna be, like, you're just"
100,00:06:29.21,00:06:29.21,gonna waste it. So I wouldn't even... I wouldn't
101,00:06:31.21,00:06:31.21,even attempt to. I'm not just saying that.
102,00:06:33.21,00:06:33.21,You're hands aren't big enough-- you can't grip the machete and
103,00:06:35.21,00:06:35.21,get down and do it. >> Ben is trying to tell
104,00:06:37.21,00:06:37.21,everybody they can't survive without Ben.
105,00:06:40.21,00:06:40.21,"Which, hey, I applaud it. You're trying to save yourself."
106,00:06:42.00,00:06:42.00,"But that's not how you do it. >> Ben, did you sleep last"
107,00:06:44.54,00:06:44.54,night? >> First time in seven days.
108,00:06:46.17,00:06:46.17,Did you poop yet? >> No.
109,00:06:48.17,00:06:48.17,">> I pooped this morning, and it was, like, the biggest poop, I"
110,00:06:50.83,00:06:50.83,"think, in my life. >> Ew."
111,00:06:54.12,00:06:54.12,">> You see, as long as Ben keeps his crazy rantics going on, his"
112,00:06:58.67,00:06:58.67,ass is gonna be on the line. >> You want to bite me?
113,00:07:02.12,00:07:02.12,"You want something to bite on? I got something for you, buddy."
114,00:07:06.50,00:07:06.50,">> I got to keep Ben here a little bit longer, 'cause he's"
115,00:07:09.04,00:07:09.04,"good for the challenges, and he's the strongest guy around"
116,00:07:11.75,00:07:11.75,the camp. So I'm gonna have to debate
117,00:07:14.00,00:07:14.00,which baby I'm gonna have to send home next.
118,00:07:17.17,00:07:17.17,">> Lizard, anybody? \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa"
119,00:07:31.38,00:07:31.38,>> Exhale out slowly through the nose.
120,00:07:36.25,00:07:36.25,">> You got it. >> Again. Nice strident back,"
121,00:07:38.62,00:07:38.62,all the way up. Breath in through the nose.
122,00:07:42.08,00:07:42.08,Hold it in. Right now we're winning.
123,00:07:45.12,00:07:45.12,We're feeling good. There's great morale.
124,00:07:47.08,00:07:47.08,We're working hard. We're all pitching in at camp.
125,00:07:49.25,00:07:49.25,We're all doing stuff. Exhale out.
126,00:07:52.21,00:07:52.21,"So we don't have to always be in game mode, and that's a huge,"
127,00:07:56.50,00:07:56.50,huge advantage that we have over Foa Foa.
128,00:07:59.58,00:07:59.58,And relax. >> Are you frickin' kidding me?
129,00:08:10.75,00:08:10.75,We got four people doing yoga this morning?
130,00:08:15.08,00:08:15.08,"I'm kind of alienated from my tribe, 'cause I'm not in the"
131,00:08:18.21,00:08:18.21,90210 clique. >> We're gonna do this slow two
132,00:08:21.50,00:08:21.50,"more times, then we're gonna put it in rhythm."
133,00:08:24.75,00:08:24.75,">> I'm not doing the warm and fuzzy, I'm doing the Rambo"
134,00:08:27.42,00:08:27.42,Shambo provider role out here. >> Feet up at an angle.
135,00:08:32.33,00:08:32.33,>> Do we have water? No. Do we have food? No.
136,00:08:36.62,00:08:36.62,"Do we have firewood? No. Screw yoga, man."
137,00:08:57.88,00:08:57.88,">> So what I'm figuring is, she's becoming a threat to us."
138,00:09:01.25,00:09:01.25,"So, uh, one thing I do know for a fact is she was trying to get"
139,00:09:05.33,00:09:05.33,"rid of you. >> Oh, man."
140,00:09:08.08,00:09:08.08,">> ""Got to get rid of Ben. Got to get rid of Ben."""
141,00:09:10.75,00:09:10.75,So just don't tell her nothin'. We're gonna sneak her.
142,00:09:14.00,00:09:14.00,"We're gonna tell her whoever, and then we're gonna all vote"
143,00:09:16.54,00:09:16.54,for her. The reason I told Ben about
144,00:09:19.54,00:09:19.54,Ashley gunning for him is 'cause right now I think I need Ben.
145,00:09:22.04,00:09:22.04,"So every person that tries to get rid of him, I'm gonna get"
146,00:09:24.75,00:09:24.75,rid of them. I don't want her to start
147,00:09:26.88,00:09:26.88,"talking, ""Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben."""
148,00:09:28.58,00:09:28.58,">> Nobody listens to her anyway. >> Yeah. So, you know, just keep"
149,00:09:31.12,00:09:31.12,it to where we can blindside her.
150,00:09:35.54,00:09:35.54,">> Cool. >> All right, man."
151,00:09:37.50,00:09:37.50,"I'm telling you, you plant that little seed in their head, in"
152,00:09:40.25,00:09:40.25,"their little brain, and then it grows, and it's called a"
153,00:09:43.12,00:09:43.12,"""Russell seed."" It takes over their whole mind."
154,00:09:47.42,00:09:47.42,So that makes it easy for me to manipulate every single one of
155,00:09:50.96,00:09:50.96,them. >> You know what?
156,00:09:56.29,00:09:56.29,Last night you stabbed me in the back.
157,00:09:58.54,00:09:58.54,>> I did nothing wrong. I was playing the game.
158,00:10:01.00,00:10:01.00,">> You didn't come to me when you heard something about me, at"
159,00:10:03.00,00:10:03.00,all. >> Because I didn't think I
160,00:10:05.00,00:10:05.00,needed to at that exact moment. >> You know what?
161,00:10:07.00,00:10:07.00,"That's the easiest thing, to come and say, ""Hey, you know"
162,00:10:09.00,00:10:09.00,"what, everybody's talking about you."""
163,00:10:10.54,00:10:10.54,I had to find out from somebody else.
164,00:10:12.46,00:10:12.46,">> Who'd you find out from? >> It wasn't Russell, that's all"
165,00:10:14.25,00:10:14.25,"I'm saying. And I don't trust you, so I'm"
166,00:10:16.12,00:10:16.12,not gonna say anything else. That's not surprising.
167,00:10:25.04,00:10:25.04,">> When people fight, I love that."
168,00:10:27.17,00:10:27.17,"How can they not even think it was me, you know?"
169,00:10:30.04,00:10:30.04,These people are just idiots. It is shocking that these people
170,00:10:34.88,00:10:34.88,"trust me so much. I mean, they really do."
171,00:10:38.12,00:10:38.12,"Everybody here trusts me. >> No, that's not true."
172,00:10:52.21,00:10:52.21,>> I know. >> I can promise you that's not
173,00:10:54.25,00:10:54.25,"true. >> No, I know."
174,00:10:55.83,00:10:55.83,You gonna say something to him? I did not say that. I didn't.
175,00:10:58.71,00:10:58.71,">> You know what I told him, I was, like, you know what, I'm"
176,00:11:01.42,00:11:01.42,not gonna fight with you. >> I've never been so confused
177,00:11:07.21,00:11:07.21,in my entire life. Yesterday Ben's name got thrown
178,00:11:10.83,00:11:10.83,"around by everyone, and apparently, someone said that I"
179,00:11:14.58,00:11:14.58,"was the one that brought it up, so I do not feel safe."
180,00:11:18.17,00:11:18.17,"I want to know who told him. >> Brett's back, Monica's back."
181,00:11:39.12,00:11:39.12,>> Tree mail! >> I love presents.
182,00:11:41.75,00:11:41.75,">> Is everyone here? >> Oh, there's a... like, a bag."
183,00:11:43.75,00:11:43.75,">> I know. >> I like the feel, though."
184,00:11:45.75,00:11:45.75,>> You see over here? I just want to go over here.
185,00:11:47.79,00:11:47.79,>> Like the feel. That's a pillowcase right there.

210,00:13:11.58,00:13:11.58,"Borassi is gone from the game. Medical's decision, not his."
211,00:13:15.92,00:13:15.92,"Nonetheless, he is gone. Foa Foa is now down to seven."
212,00:13:20.12,00:13:20.12,Guys ready to get to today's challenge?

220,00:13:47.21,00:13:47.21,will be waiting to try to slow you down.
221,00:13:49.62,00:13:49.62,It will get physical. Once both swimmers get through
222,00:13:52.17,00:13:52.17,"the zone, you're free to retrieve your crate."
223,00:13:54.67,00:13:54.67,"Once you have your crate back to the mat, the next two go."

377,00:22:39.29,00:22:39.29,">> Hi, smiley girl, how are you? >> Good."
378,00:22:41.96,00:22:41.96,>> So nice to finally talk to you.
379,00:22:44.04,00:22:44.04,>> I know. >> One of my main objectives in
380,00:22:46.71,00:22:46.71,this game was to create interpersonal relationships as
381,00:22:49.58,00:22:49.58,soon as possible. So when Russell picked me to
382,00:22:52.17,00:22:52.17,"go, I was tickled pink to head over and check out Foa Foa."
383,00:22:55.54,00:22:55.54,">> Shambo, I'm Ben. >> Big Benjamin, what's going"
384,00:22:59.17,00:22:59.17,"on, beefcake? >> Nothing much."
385,00:23:01.33,00:23:01.33,>> Those bright eyes smiling at everybody all the time.
386,00:23:04.54,00:23:04.54,"There was a lot of chitter-chat. I shared with them, they shared"
387,00:23:07.00,00:23:07.00,"with me. And, it's funny, people here"
388,00:23:10.04,00:23:10.04,"are closer to my own age, they get me, I get them."
389,00:23:13.12,00:23:13.12,I feel like I have more in common with this tribe than
390,00:23:15.42,00:23:15.42,people on my tribe. >> They're all younger.
391,00:23:17.96,00:23:17.96,>> They're like 90210. I'm hanging out with 90210 and
392,00:23:21.17,00:23:21.17,it's absolutely mind-boggling. I don't think it's like life or
393,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"death to, say, get everybody together in the morning and go,"
394,00:23:29.21,00:23:29.21,"""Okay, you guys, this is what we need to accomplish, and as soon"
395,00:23:33.04,00:23:33.04,"as we get it done, the day is yours."""
396,00:23:35.33,00:23:35.33,">> Yeah, we get crab... >> 90210 wanted to do yoga this"
397,00:23:38.25,00:23:38.25,morning instead of get water. >> Yoga?
398,00:23:40.04,00:23:40.04,>> Really? >> We don't have the luxury of
399,00:23:42.04,00:23:42.04,doing yoga. We're like up the...
400,00:23:44.08,00:23:44.08,">> I'm sorry, baby. I'm not in the Survivor game"
401,00:23:46.08,00:23:46.08,"to play yoga, okay? >> Of course she's here for a"
402,00:23:49.67,00:23:49.67,"reason, so she's here to find the immunity idol, I presume,"
403,00:23:53.21,00:23:53.21,and to get information to go back to her tribe which she
404,00:23:56.58,00:23:56.58,claims she's not super tight with.
405,00:23:59.67,00:23:59.67,"But you always have to assume someone's lying, always."
406,00:24:04.04,00:24:04.04,>> You guys appreciate me for the woman I am.
407,00:24:06.58,00:24:06.58,">> Yeah! >> I love you, Shannon."
408,00:24:08.17,00:24:08.17,>> Yoga. >> When I got the note from Jeff
409,00:24:21.21,00:24:21.21,"I thought it was hidden immunity idol clues, and I was"
410,00:24:23.83,00:24:23.83,"exactly right. ""If you think you need"
411,00:24:28.08,00:24:28.08,"protection and would like immunity, look here at Foa Foa"
412,00:24:31.46,00:24:31.46,and bark up the right tree. Clue 2: Within sight of the
413,00:24:37.88,00:24:37.88,"fire and close to the ground, seek the root of the problem"
414,00:24:42.21,00:24:42.21,"and salvation will be found."" Wow."
415,00:24:48.12,00:24:48.12,I am very excited. There's a hidden immunity idol
416,00:24:51.08,00:24:51.08,at the Foa Foa camp. My tribe is probably going to
417,00:24:53.79,00:24:53.79,try to vote me out sooner or later anyway.
418,00:24:56.25,00:24:56.25,So this totally rocks. >> Now Shambo has the second
419,00:25:03.17,00:25:03.17,"note, but I have the immunity idol without any letters or"
420,00:25:06.67,00:25:06.67,anything. I just used my brilliant brain
421,00:25:10.38,00:25:10.38,to figure out where it was. I'm running this whole show
422,00:25:14.00,00:25:14.00,right now. I'm the boss.
423,00:25:28.46,00:25:28.46,"That was, like, such a great... >> We have blankets!"
424,00:25:32.62,00:25:32.62,">> So, to be honest my natural inclination today was to take"
425,00:25:36.58,00:25:36.58,that camping stuff. But here's the deal-- I'm the
426,00:25:39.67,00:25:39.67,type of man that believes that you're supposed to take care of
427,00:25:42.75,00:25:42.75,"your women, all right? I've got a wife and a daughter."
428,00:25:46.46,00:25:46.46,"They're not here. You guys are, all right?"
429,00:25:48.71,00:25:48.71,"Right now, you guys are part of my women."
430,00:25:51.17,00:25:51.17,"I got to take care of you, all right?"
431,00:25:52.88,00:25:52.88,"So, guys, I wanted you to know that."
432,00:25:54.17,00:25:54.17,So we've got a little bit of work to do.
433,00:25:56.08,00:25:56.08,Hopefully we can get some good food...
434,00:25:57.21,00:25:57.21,>> We'll get the bed fixed. How's that?
435,00:25:58.88,00:25:58.88,>> That sounds good. >> After we arrived back at
436,00:26:02.25,00:26:02.25,camp with our comfort items there was a little monologue
437,00:26:05.71,00:26:05.71,"given by Russell that I think to him he sort of felt, like,"
438,00:26:08.92,00:26:08.92,obliged to justify his decision. >> We're having a bed.
439,00:26:14.79,00:26:14.79,">> For crying out loud, how comfortable are four pillows,"
440,00:26:17.50,00:26:17.50,three beach towels and two woven palm frond mats going to
441,00:26:21.29,00:26:21.29,make you? You're still going to be
442,00:26:23.08,00:26:23.08,uncomfortable. >> How are those mats feeling?
443,00:26:25.12,00:26:25.12,>> Perfect. >> Come lay down here with me.
444,00:26:28.92,00:26:28.92,>> Russell did not take the tarp and I think that was a bad
445,00:26:31.21,00:26:31.21,move. I would have sacrificed
446,00:26:33.33,00:26:33.33,everything on that comfort item list for the tarp.
447,00:26:36.12,00:26:36.12,Because maybe it won't rain for 39 days.
448,00:26:38.67,00:26:38.67,Maybe I'm wrong. But the day it does rain over
449,00:26:40.58,00:26:40.58,"here, every single one of those comfort luxury items are going"
450,00:26:44.04,00:26:44.04,to be soaked and all of a sudden not so comfortable.
451,00:26:47.04,00:26:47.04,These girls here think that this is like Club Med.
452,00:26:49.88,00:26:49.88,"It's not Club Med. >> Oh, yeah!"
453,00:26:53.96,00:26:53.96,>> You did so good out there. >> You did.
454,00:26:56.42,00:26:56.42,>> I'm so proud of you. >> Yeah.
455,00:27:09.21,00:27:09.21,"I mean, it's like this. If it's not, then I'm leaving."
456,00:27:11.04,00:27:11.04,So everybody can make a decision.
457,00:27:17.04,00:27:17.04,I'm just saying. Like I am going to put it out
458,00:27:19.00,00:27:19.00,there like that. That is my ultimatum.
459,00:27:20.50,00:27:20.50,>> That's fine. >> I'm trying to circulate it
460,00:27:21.92,00:27:21.92,that I might just walk away if Ben is here after Tribal
461,00:27:23.67,00:27:23.67,"Council. You know, I have no intention"
462,00:27:26.67,00:27:26.67,"of quitting whatsoever, but I'm willing to do just about"
463,00:27:28.50,00:27:28.50,anything to get rid of that guy right now.
464,00:27:31.83,00:27:31.83,It's the racist comments. I won't stand here and tolerate
465,00:27:33.79,00:27:33.79,that. I just won't.
466,00:27:35.88,00:27:35.88,">> Natalie, if I get kicked out I'm leaving you my sweater and"
467,00:27:39.12,00:27:39.12,"my tennis shoes, okay? >> Jaison is like it's either"
468,00:27:42.17,00:27:42.17,"me or him. >> No, it's either me or him?"
469,00:27:44.00,00:27:44.00,">> No, no, no. >> I don't know what to think"
470,00:27:55.00,00:27:55.00,anymore. No one understands unless their
471,00:27:56.83,00:27:56.83,name gets brought up. Ben has some personal thing
472,00:28:00.71,00:28:00.71,against me. And I'm trying as much as
473,00:28:04.25,00:28:04.25,possible to not have me eliminated.
474,00:28:06.79,00:28:06.79,But it's hard. >> Ashley's going home.
475,00:28:13.96,00:28:13.96,>> And who else is on board with that?
476,00:28:17.79,00:28:17.79,You? Yeah.
477,00:28:19.88,00:28:19.88,I'm saying... >> All right.
478,00:28:23.08,00:28:23.08,>> So Russell and Liz are adamant about voting Ashley
479,00:28:25.04,00:28:25.04,"out, but that worries me because I am definitely loyal"
480,00:28:27.33,00:28:27.33,"to Jaison. >> Yeah, yeah."
481,00:28:32.33,00:28:32.33,Definitely. >> I like Jaison.
482,00:28:42.25,00:28:42.25,"Even though, man, he's just not..."
483,00:28:44.58,00:28:44.58,His mind's getting messed up. >> I know.
484,00:28:46.92,00:28:46.92,>> He's getting broke down. >> He really lets this stuff
485,00:28:48.50,00:28:48.50,"get to him. But I just want you to know,"
486,00:28:50.17,00:28:50.17,"Russell, that, you know, I think you have a good enough vibe from"
487,00:28:55.00,00:28:55.00,"me already that I'm a trustworthy guy, and I'll go by"
488,00:28:58.50,00:28:58.50,"my word, and I will. And if that's my downfall, then"
489,00:29:00.88,00:29:00.88,"so be it. You know, I want to win."
490,00:29:02.79,00:29:02.79,"I'm here to win, too-- >> Then give me your word you"
491,00:29:05.00,00:29:05.00,won't vote for me and we'll let Ben go next.
492,00:29:07.42,00:29:07.42,>> All right. After Ashley?
493,00:29:09.21,00:29:09.21,>> After Ashley. >> Look me in the eye.
494,00:29:12.25,00:29:12.25,">> You've got my word. >> All right, done and done."
495,00:29:15.92,00:29:15.92,">> I want Mick to trust me, and I want him to know how"
496,00:29:21.17,00:29:21.17,important it is that we stick together and we can make this
497,00:29:24.54,00:29:24.54,"work. So, I'm going to let him know"
498,00:29:27.12,00:29:27.12,about the hidden immunity idol. The immunity idol is a powerful
499,00:29:31.25,00:29:31.25,"tool, and it is a tool to where this person would say, well,"
500,00:29:34.71,00:29:34.71,this guy must really trust me. >> That's some brilliance on
501,00:29:43.50,00:29:43.50,your part. >> My alliance with Mick is
502,00:29:46.25,00:29:46.25,solid. So that's just another vote for
503,00:29:48.25,00:29:48.25,me to get Ashley out. It's simple.
504,00:29:51.25,00:29:51.25,I was born for this. This is what God made me for.
505,00:30:08.75,00:30:08.75,">> Good job, buddy. You want to start stripping"
506,00:30:10.75,00:30:10.75,them? You know how to do that?
507,00:30:13.12,00:30:13.12,I'm going to show you guys lickety-split.
508,00:30:15.88,00:30:15.88,Get it like this. Go.
509,00:30:20.08,00:30:20.08,Okay? And then get them like this.
510,00:30:24.17,00:30:24.17,"And then wrap them. And then take the ends, tie it"
511,00:30:27.92,00:30:27.92,"around, tuck it in, and you have a little poofy torch."
512,00:30:31.21,00:30:31.21,>> Sweet. >> Okay?
513,00:30:33.62,00:30:33.62,>> All right. >> Just like that.
514,00:30:35.08,00:30:35.08,"I've been hooking it up and cooking it up at camp today,"
515,00:30:37.67,00:30:37.67,taught them a few new tricks that they didn't know.
516,00:30:40.33,00:30:40.33,"So, you know, trying to be helpful and make good"
517,00:30:42.04,00:30:42.04,relationships with these people. But I need to start looking for
518,00:30:47.50,00:30:47.50,hidden immunity idol. I'm going to do a little recon
519,00:30:52.12,00:30:52.12,mission and we'll see what we can come up with.
520,00:30:54.96,00:30:54.96,"Look at all this good firewood, Liz."
521,00:30:57.17,00:30:57.17,>> Oh. >> Holy cow!
522,00:30:59.71,00:30:59.71,"Oh, dude! >> I love Shambo."
523,00:31:06.46,00:31:06.46,"I wish she were over here. She is so nice, and she's"
524,00:31:09.25,00:31:09.25,bringing a real good energy to us.
525,00:31:11.17,00:31:11.17,">> Oh, my word, for sure. >> I can't believe no one's"
526,00:31:15.62,00:31:15.62,doing anything at their camp. >> It's amazing.
527,00:31:18.12,00:31:18.12,Who has time to do yoga on the beach?
528,00:31:20.25,00:31:20.25,>> It's ridiculous. >> My sentiments exactly.
529,00:31:29.17,00:31:29.17,">> I noticed the girls are talking a little more, and I"
530,00:31:32.42,00:31:32.42,will regret not sending Ashley home because there's no way she
531,00:31:36.21,00:31:36.21,ain't going to try to get that all-girl thing or something.
532,00:31:39.54,00:31:39.54,We got to put a squash on that and we got this game under
533,00:31:42.46,00:31:42.46,"control. That's the plan, dude."
534,00:31:47.42,00:31:47.42,I think we got to get rid of her.
535,00:31:53.00,00:31:53.00,I want to get rid of Ashley. >> What's the problem voting
536,00:31:59.08,00:31:59.08,Ben off tonight? >> I'm on the fence with Ben
537,00:32:01.50,00:32:01.50,right now. >> Why?
538,00:32:03.21,00:32:03.21,>> 'Cause I know that what if we do a challenge?
539,00:32:05.38,00:32:05.38,Is he a strong player? >> No.
540,00:32:07.00,00:32:07.00,>> You don't think he's stronger than...?
541,00:32:12.83,00:32:12.83,">> Okay, let's think about the numbers, then."
542,00:32:20.42,00:32:20.42,">> I don't like that. >> I don't really like that,"
543,00:32:23.12,00:32:23.12,either. >> They will gang up on us.
544,00:32:25.25,00:32:25.25,Don't believe they won't. That's the whole thing.
545,00:32:28.71,00:32:28.71,That's what I do not like. >> Your only concern is the
546,00:32:31.25,00:32:31.25,girls voting us three on three? I'm not worried about that.
547,00:32:36.33,00:32:36.33,Those girls are so weak it would be suicide if they tried
548,00:32:39.25,00:32:39.25,to pick us off one by one. >> And then we'll get rid
549,00:32:46.12,00:32:46.12,of Ben. I don't want them to have
550,00:32:48.08,00:32:48.08,"numbers. You know, right now, it's just"
551,00:32:50.21,00:32:50.21,"not-- and I know you hate it--. >> I know, man."
552,00:32:54.79,00:32:54.79,>> I'm making my peace at this Tribal Council.
553,00:32:57.67,00:32:57.67,That's the way it's going down. If you guys want to have
554,00:33:01.04,00:33:01.04,discord in the camp because of the guy who does nothing in
555,00:33:04.25,00:33:04.25,challenges and provides very little at camp then you go
556,00:33:06.04,00:33:06.04,"right ahead. And if you leave him here,"
557,00:33:07.54,00:33:07.54,that's going to be a rough night tonight.
558,00:33:08.96,00:33:08.96,That's going to be a rough day tomorrow.
559,00:33:10.25,00:33:10.25,That's going to be a rough night the next night.
560,00:33:16.46,00:33:16.46,">> I want to keep Ben around, but everybody's saying how he's"
561,00:33:20.50,00:33:20.50,a poison and this and that. So it's becoming-- I don't want
562,00:33:23.71,00:33:23.71,them not to trust me. So it's like... man.
563,00:33:49.75,00:33:49.75,">> PROBST: Shambo, go ahead and have a seat."
564,00:34:00.67,00:34:00.67,"Shambo is just here to observe tonight, not participate in any"
565,00:34:03.96,00:34:03.96,"other way. Jaison, what was it like having"
566,00:34:06.83,00:34:06.83,a visitor? Shambo's been with you guys for
567,00:34:09.21,00:34:09.21,"the last day and a half. >> I think Shambo's amazing,"
568,00:34:11.42,00:34:11.42,you know? I would love to propose a trade
569,00:34:13.67,00:34:13.67,"with Galu and trade somebody for Shambo, specifically Ben,"
570,00:34:17.12,00:34:17.12,"frankly. You know, she's a positive"
571,00:34:19.25,00:34:19.25,force in camp while he is an incredibly negative force.
572,00:34:22.29,00:34:22.29,So she's amazing. I love her.
573,00:34:24.21,00:34:24.21,"She's great. >> PROBST: Ben, first you vote"
574,00:34:26.46,00:34:26.46,out Marisa because she's a negative force.
575,00:34:29.12,00:34:29.12,Last Tribal Council you vote out Betsy because she's on the
576,00:34:31.58,00:34:31.58,outside. And who are you going to vote
577,00:34:33.54,00:34:33.54,out tonight and why? >> I'm voting for Ashley
578,00:34:36.33,00:34:36.33,because I think she's the weakest link in the group.
579,00:34:39.75,00:34:39.75,">> PROBST: Ashley, why would it make sense from a tribe's point"
580,00:34:42.83,00:34:42.83,"of view to get rid of you? >> Honestly, I don't think I'm"
581,00:34:46.08,00:34:46.08,the weakest one and I'm not bringing a negative energy
582,00:34:48.96,00:34:48.96,around the tribe either. >> I don't approach people with
583,00:34:51.08,00:34:51.08,negativity. I react.
584,00:34:53.08,00:34:53.08,"If you come at me nice and sweet, you're going to get nice"
585,00:34:55.12,00:34:55.12,"and sweet. You come at me with some trash,"
586,00:34:57.38,00:34:57.38,you're going to get some trash. >> Here's the thing-- when
587,00:35:00.25,00:35:00.25,someone is in camp screaming and yelling at other people
588,00:35:03.38,00:35:03.38,"constantly about everything, that puts everyone in a"
589,00:35:07.29,00:35:07.29,bad mood. >> Who have I screamed and
590,00:35:09.08,00:35:09.08,"yelled at, Jaison? >> You have yelled at Ashley."
591,00:35:10.79,00:35:10.79,You have yelled at Marisa. You yelled at one of our guests
592,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,who came. Anybody who asks you a question
593,00:35:14.96,00:35:14.96,"or tries to do something on their own, you constantly"
594,00:35:16.67,00:35:16.67,correct them and tell them they're doing it wrong.
595,00:35:18.29,00:35:18.29,>> Not true. That's not true. >> That's absolutely true.
596,00:35:20.08,00:35:20.08,>> Is that true? >> 100% true.
597,00:35:21.08,00:35:21.08,>> When you have asked me to do things--
598,00:35:22.83,00:35:22.83,>> Amazing how you always try to go to someone that you think
599,00:35:24.75,00:35:24.75,is weak. That's what bullies do.
600,00:35:26.42,00:35:26.42,You yell at every single girl. >> I'm not a bully.
601,00:35:29.04,00:35:29.04,"You're a... baby, dude. >> Don't ask her. Talk to me."
602,00:35:32.08,00:35:32.08,">> You have these temper tantrums after every challenge,"
603,00:35:33.92,00:35:33.92,"like, ""Oh, I don't want to be on the team."""
604,00:35:36.08,00:35:36.08,">> ""Oh my God, I'm an outlaw. I'm a renegade!"
605,00:35:37.88,00:35:37.88,"They splashed me in the face, I can't tackle anyone now, sorry."
606,00:35:40.50,00:35:40.50,"I got splashed."" >> Okay, Ivy League, keep it up."
607,00:35:42.71,00:35:42.71,>> Who are you trying to kid? Who are you trying to fool?
608,00:35:45.29,00:35:45.29,>> I'm not trying to kid anybody.
609,00:35:47.42,00:35:47.42,">> PROBST: Natalie, what's it like being in the middle of"
610,00:35:49.83,00:35:49.83,"this? >> Um, I was just kind of"
611,00:35:52.83,00:35:52.83,"leaning back just in case fists go flying, 'cause I don't want"
612,00:35:56.75,00:35:56.75,"it to be me getting hit. >> PROBST: Russell, you're a guy"
613,00:36:00.21,00:36:00.21,that likes to get scrappy. Explain to me what's going on
614,00:36:04.04,00:36:04.04,between Ben and Jaison. >> I think that it's just Ben
615,00:36:08.08,00:36:08.08,"said some negative things that might have been, uh, racial."
616,00:36:14.38,00:36:14.38,>> They might have been racial? Okay.
617,00:36:17.00,00:36:17.00,">> And it affected the way Jaison thought about him, and"
618,00:36:19.17,00:36:19.17,that was it. That was the end of the
619,00:36:20.92,00:36:20.92,"relationship. >> PROBST: Jaison, you guys"
620,00:36:23.67,00:36:23.67,still have a chance in this game.
621,00:36:26.21,00:36:26.21,You're down four after tonight. But you're not out.
622,00:36:29.67,00:36:29.67,Is there any way you could heal this wound?
623,00:36:33.25,00:36:33.25,">> I just have to draw a line in the sand, and I have to say"
624,00:36:35.96,00:36:35.96,"that, you know, there is no $1 million that is worth me"
625,00:36:40.08,00:36:40.08,sitting up here with him anymore.
626,00:36:42.12,00:36:42.12,"I mean, I sat here and watched him scream at Yasmin at our"
627,00:36:45.21,00:36:45.21,"camp, and over here, saying incredible things."
628,00:36:50.29,00:36:50.29,So is there a way to patch this rift?
629,00:36:52.71,00:36:52.71,I don't think so. But I'm not going to sit in
630,00:36:54.67,00:36:54.67,camp and listen to this guy anymore. I'm just not.
631,00:36:57.04,00:36:57.04,">> PROBST: Ben, big reaction from him."
632,00:36:59.50,00:36:59.50,">> I have said from the get-go, everybody knows I've been very,"
633,00:37:02.00,00:37:02.00,"very consistent. I have not started one fight,"
634,00:37:04.12,00:37:04.12,not started one. >> That's not even what I was
635,00:37:06.75,00:37:06.75,talking about. I was talking more about the
636,00:37:08.33,00:37:08.33,ghetto trash that you tried to call her over there.
637,00:37:10.21,00:37:10.21,">> Okay, well, if she's from the ghetto and she's trashy,"
638,00:37:12.00,00:37:12.00,that's ghetto trash. I'm sorry.
639,00:37:14.12,00:37:14.12,That's not racial whatsoever. That's where you're from and
640,00:37:18.25,00:37:18.25,how you're acting. That's ghetto trash.
641,00:37:20.12,00:37:20.12,">> If that's really what you think, Ben."
642,00:37:22.25,00:37:22.25,>> So if you can't understand that--
643,00:37:23.96,00:37:23.96,">> Let me make another point, then Southern guy with"
644,00:37:26.00,00:37:26.00,Southern ways. Do you really think you should
645,00:37:27.71,00:37:27.71,"talk to a woman that way? >> You know what, if she is"
646,00:37:30.04,00:37:30.04,"going to be disrespectful-- Southern gentleman, do you"
647,00:37:32.04,00:37:32.04,speak to a young lady that way? >> She's not a lady.
648,00:37:33.71,00:37:33.71,">> Really, she wasn't a lady? I mean, come on."
649,00:37:36.21,00:37:36.21,">> Ladies have manners, okay? This girl right here, Southern,"
650,00:37:39.12,00:37:39.12,"has manners. Says yes, sir, yes, ma'am,"
651,00:37:41.46,00:37:41.46,"please, thank you. So, Yasmin is being a bitch,"
652,00:37:44.12,00:37:44.12,"then she's not a lady. I mean, it's not that hard."
653,00:37:47.17,00:37:47.17,>> Okay. >> There was nothing racial that
654,00:37:48.54,00:37:48.54,"I said. >> Okay, whatever."
655,00:37:50.12,00:37:50.12,>> It was strictly what I saw. >> If you say so.
656,00:37:52.33,00:37:52.33,>> How she was acting towards me.
657,00:37:55.00,00:37:55.00,"So, if you want to call it a racial game and play that card,"
658,00:37:57.42,00:37:57.42,"then go for it, buddy. >> You know, you should have"
659,00:38:00.25,00:38:00.25,"some sensitivity to history, and historically when certain"
660,00:38:05.33,00:38:05.33,"comments are made and directed toward certain people, it is"
661,00:38:09.46,00:38:09.46,"because of race. I mean, if what you're telling"
662,00:38:13.21,00:38:13.21,"me is that what you said had absolutely no racial context,"
663,00:38:17.38,00:38:17.38,then maybe Yasmin was right and you are ignorant.
664,00:38:20.21,00:38:20.21,"Maybe you really don't get it. >> PROBST: Ashley, any time"
665,00:38:26.58,00:38:26.58,"there's heat on somebody else, it means it's not on you."
666,00:38:29.83,00:38:29.83,"Gotta make you feel great. >> Well, I've known the last"
667,00:38:32.12,00:38:32.12,"couple of days that he's going to vote for me, but there's"
668,00:38:34.54,00:38:34.54,"definitely other tension, so it does leave it a little off me."
669,00:38:37.79,00:38:37.79,"But I packed my bags. I mean, you never know what"
670,00:38:40.38,00:38:40.38,"happens in the game. >> PROBST: Ben, is there"
671,00:38:42.92,00:38:42.92,anything you've said that you regret and you would like to say
672,00:38:45.08,00:38:45.08,"to Jaison now, ""dude, I didn't mean anything by it""?"
673,00:38:48.08,00:38:48.08,>> Not anything I can think of. >> All right.
674,00:38:54.62,00:38:54.62,">> PROBST: All right, it's time to get to the vote, which"
675,00:38:56.71,00:38:56.71,"means, Shambo, it's time for you to go."
676,00:38:58.58,00:38:58.58,You have certainly heard a lot tonight.
677,00:39:00.75,00:39:00.75,"What you share with your tribe mates, up to you."
678,00:39:02.92,00:39:02.92,"Grab your stuff, head back to camp."
679,00:39:05.21,00:39:05.21,"Good night. All right, it is time to vote."
680,00:39:13.33,00:39:13.33,"Mick, you're up. >> I just really think you need"
681,00:39:29.38,00:39:29.38,to grow up. That's all I have to say to you.
682,00:39:43.04,00:39:43.04,>> You knew it was coming. >> PROBST: I'll go tally
683,00:40:00.12,00:40:00.12,"the votes. Once the votes are read, the"
684,00:40:11.92,00:40:11.92,decision is final. The person voted out will be
685,00:40:14.08,00:40:14.08,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
686,00:40:15.88,00:40:15.88,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Ashley."
687,00:40:26.04,00:40:26.04,"Ben. One vote Ashley, one vote Ben."
688,00:40:31.29,00:40:31.29,"Ben. Two votes Ben, one vote Ashley."
689,00:40:37.25,00:40:37.25,"Ben. That's three votes Ben, one"
690,00:40:40.25,00:40:40.25,vote Ashley. Third person voted out of
691,00:40:48.17,00:40:48.17,"Survivor: Samoa-- Ben. That's four, that's enough."
692,00:40:51.42,00:40:51.42,You need to bring me your torch. >> Thank God.
693,00:41:00.04,00:41:00.04,">> PROBST: Ben, the tribe has spoken."
694,00:41:04.21,00:41:04.21,Time for you to go. I'm not sure I have much to
695,00:41:16.46,00:41:16.46,offer you guys. You've got to figure out how to
696,00:41:19.04,00:41:19.04,turn things around. Or I will be seeing you back
697,00:41:22.12,00:41:22.12,here at Tribal Council. Grab your torches.
698,00:41:24.29,00:41:24.29,Head back to camp. Good night.
699,00:41:39.04,00:41:39.04,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
700,00:41:46.17,00:41:46.17,>> PROBST: Next time on Survivor:
701,00:41:49.58,00:41:49.58,>> I'm tired. I'm hungry.
702,00:41:52.58,00:41:52.58,>> PROBST: Russell gets fed up with Jaison.
703,00:41:55.29,00:41:55.29,>> What kind of man is that? >> PROBST: And at Galu...
704,00:41:58.29,00:41:58.29,>> Wherever the immunity idol is on their beach is probably
705,00:42:00.46,00:42:00.46,on our beach. >> PROBST: It's not so easy to
706,00:42:02.58,00:42:02.58,"find a hidden immunity idol. >> Well, I think it's pretty"
707,00:42:11.83,00:42:11.83,funny that I'm going home because I think everybody's
708,00:42:14.46,00:42:14.46,going to starve. I think it's even funnier that
709,00:42:16.71,00:42:16.71,it's raining. 'Cause you guys are going to be
710,00:42:18.67,00:42:18.67,wet. I'm really not worried about it.
711,00:42:20.42,00:42:20.42,"I'm glad I'm getting a nice, dry sleep tonight."
712,00:42:23.08,00:42:23.08,"The tribe is a bunch of sissies, everybody except"
713,00:42:25.29,00:42:25.29,Russell. I was the hardest working guy
714,00:42:27.17,00:42:27.17,"in camp, everybody knew that. They'll miss me when I'm gone."
