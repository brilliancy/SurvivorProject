331,00:20:40.83,00:20:40.83,"life, if it was the final two,it's me and you, because that's"
332,00:20:43.12,00:20:43.12,my deal.I'm not very cool with losing to
333,00:20:46.08,00:20:46.08,"Denise, and I'm not very coolwith losing to Courtney."
334,00:20:50.17,00:20:50.17,"You don't have to trust me, but,like, that's the honest, 100%"
335,00:20:53.25,00:20:53.25,truth from Todd.I swear on my life.

341,00:21:19.08,00:21:19.08,lay here and be stinky.>> It hurt my feelings a little
342,00:21:21.08,00:21:21.08,that Amanda didn't take me.Pizza and beer would have been
343,00:21:23.54,00:21:23.54,great today.I would have enjoyed it.
344,00:21:25.62,00:21:25.62,We haven't been eating too mucharound here.
345,00:21:30.08,00:21:30.08,So any time that you get to eatsomething and get stronger for

350,00:21:46.67,00:21:46.67,picked second to last or Iwasn't picked at all.
351,00:21:49.83,00:21:49.83,"But having an alliance, being ina group of, you know, four"
352,00:21:52.71,00:21:52.71,"people, I've been safe.But now it's four people."
353,00:21:57.08,00:21:57.08,"One's going home.It's... you know, there is going"
354,00:21:59.67,00:21:59.67,to be somebody left out.It is so humid and hot out here.
355,00:22:06.04,00:22:06.04,>> Yeah.I've sort of embraced it.
356,00:22:10.29,00:22:10.29,I'm just going to be in a sweatbath for the rest of the day.
357,00:22:13.25,00:22:13.25,>> I thought Todd and you werepretty tight.
358,00:22:14.83,00:22:14.83,It looks like Todd and Amandaare pretty tight.

362,00:22:38.92,00:22:38.92,"It's kind of a mix of, well, canI trust my girls that I've been"
363,00:22:42.88,00:22:42.88,"trusting for so long, or arethey going to turn on me?"
364,00:22:45.58,00:22:45.58,"But I have no choice but to justhope, you know?"
365,00:22:49.17,00:22:49.17,"I can talk all I want, but otherthan that, I have to just hope."
366,00:22:53.21,00:22:53.21,">> Hi, guys.>> What's up?"
367,00:22:57.54,00:22:57.54,">> It was good.It's like 900,000 degrees too."

371,00:23:20.04,00:23:20.04,"line, it hurts.>> You know, I just don't want"
372,00:23:22.83,00:23:22.83,to go home yet.>> I hear you.
373,00:23:25.08,00:23:25.08,I don't know.I really am afraid that it's

392,00:24:21.75,00:24:21.75,"or a seat in the top three,like, you can count on Todd."
393,00:24:25.21,00:24:25.21,He will not look out for you.He does not care.
394,00:24:27.75,00:24:27.75,"He is looking out for himself.>> Todd and Denise were, like,"
395,00:24:51.92,00:24:51.92,"talking in the shelter.They were, like, talking about"
396,00:24:55.17,00:24:55.17,"the final four or whatever.So I don't know if Todd is,"
397,00:24:57.88,00:24:57.88,"like, just paranoid at thispoint, but he's, like, just"
398,00:25:04.00,00:25:04.00,talking different stories toeach one of us.
399,00:25:06.71,00:25:06.71,">> That's why I had Todd go,just because, like, I wanted him"

402,00:25:15.17,00:25:15.17,"Courtney.Like, you can trust me."
403,00:25:17.12,00:25:17.12,"I'm in this.""And I told him point blank,"

406,00:25:26.08,00:25:26.08,And I told him point blank Ididn't.
407,00:25:27.92,00:25:27.92,"Then he's like, ""Amanda, it'sthe final two, and let's get rid"
408,00:25:31.29,00:25:31.29,"of Courtney.""And I'm like, ""You're telling"

412,00:25:49.42,00:25:49.42,>> I know I'm feeling paranoiato be left alone.
413,00:25:52.08,00:25:52.08,"I see people gather off on theirown, and that bugs me."

416,00:26:04.08,00:26:04.08,>> Yeah.>> I'm hoping that Courtney and
417,00:26:07.12,00:26:07.12,Amanda are still on the samewavelengths as me so that Denise
418,00:26:10.17,00:26:10.17,can be the next on the choppingblock instead of them going all
419,00:26:13.71,00:26:13.71,girl power on me and voting meout.
420,00:26:16.54,00:26:16.54,"So paranoia on my side is quitehigh, and I hate being paranoid."
421,00:26:20.58,00:26:20.58,I hate it.I don't know.
422,00:26:24.25,00:26:24.25,I think we'd be probably themost fantastic final three in

575,00:38:35.08,00:38:35.08,The next dish you're going toplace on is the small bowl-- not
576,00:38:39.04,00:38:39.04,the big bowl and not the soysauce.
577,00:38:44.92,00:38:44.92,"Here we go.Three, two, one, place it."
578,00:38:54.79,00:38:54.79,Todd's still shaking a bit.This is an opportunity to
579,00:38:58.88,00:38:58.88,guarantee that you have a shotat the million dollars.
580,00:39:11.04,00:39:11.04,"All right, the next dish you'regoing to place is another small"

586,00:39:53.17,00:39:53.17,Todd's the first person out ofthe challenge.
587,00:39:55.96,00:39:55.96,"Todd, have a seat on the bench.Time to place another item."
588,00:40:03.38,00:40:03.38,This time you're going to addthe rice bowl.
589,00:40:10.17,00:40:10.17,"Here we go.Three, two, one, place it."
590,00:40:17.71,00:40:17.71,Amanda makes a strategic moveand goes the other direction.

640,00:44:02.50,00:44:02.50,"tonight, but I'm afraid whoevergets voted out tonight is going"
641,00:44:06.62,00:44:06.62,"to think that it was because ofme, because I'm the free vote"
642,00:44:09.71,00:44:09.71,"tonight.So it's such a good thing, and"
643,00:44:14.33,00:44:14.33,"then it can be such a bad thing.>> I feel really, really nervous"
644,00:44:27.50,00:44:27.50,"right now.You know, a lot of these kids"
645,00:44:29.46,00:44:29.46,are so much younger than I am.I'm kind of the old lady around
646,00:44:32.25,00:44:32.25,"here.So, I mean, I do feel a little"
647,00:44:34.12,00:44:34.12,"on the outsides, but I might beable to sway Amanda."
648,00:44:53.62,00:44:53.62,">> You know, I mean...>> You know?"
649,00:45:30.79,00:45:30.79,>> You know?>> I think Denise has played a
650,00:45:39.17,00:45:39.17,"great game, and I think she'sbeen one of the most honest"
651,00:45:42.67,00:45:42.67,"players here.So it's hard, because I want to"
652,00:45:45.42,00:45:45.42,"keep her around, but I don't,because it's more competition to"
653,00:45:49.08,00:45:49.08,me in the end.I just...
654,00:45:54.17,00:45:54.17,"This could be, like, my million-dollar decision tonight."
655,00:45:56.71,00:45:56.71,Someone's going to get a milliondollars.
656,00:45:58.04,00:45:58.04,Two people aren't.So do you give them that chance
657,00:46:00.33,00:46:00.33,"because they deserve it, or doyou pick someone that you feel"
658,00:46:03.79,00:46:03.79,you have a better chanceagainst?
659,00:46:42.25,00:46:42.25,>> Amanda holds all the cardsright now.
660,00:46:43.88,00:46:43.88,"She can vote with Denise rightnow and make it a tie, so right"
661,00:46:47.25,00:46:47.25,now my one goal is to get rid ofDenise.
662,00:46:51.17,00:46:51.17,And I'm hoping that Courtney andAmanda are still on the same
663,00:46:53.88,00:46:53.88,"wavelengths as me, and I hopeI'm here on day 39 still."
664,00:48:00.88,00:48:00.88,">> Who are you voting for?>> Well, it all depends on"
665,00:48:03.33,00:48:03.33,"what's going on.I mean, I would vote for Todd if"
666,00:48:06.08,00:48:06.08,I could.>> I'll just tell you the
667,00:48:08.25,00:48:08.25,"position I'm in right now, justso you're fully aware."
668,00:48:11.17,00:48:11.17,Me and Todd had an alliance onday one.
669,00:48:13.71,00:48:13.71,">> Yeah, I understand that.>> You know what I'm saying?"
670,00:48:16.21,00:48:16.21,"So I'm really at a crossroads,Denise, because it's like do I"
671,00:48:19.67,00:48:19.67,backstab somebody that I've hadan alliance with since the
672,00:48:22.21,00:48:22.21,beginning?You know what I'm saying?
673,00:48:24.08,00:48:24.08,"But this kills me, because Iwould rather have you sitting"
674,00:48:27.46,00:48:27.46,next to me in final three thanTodd.
675,00:48:30.08,00:48:30.08,I haven't even trusted him thiswhole time.
676,00:48:32.50,00:48:32.50,">> No, I don't trust him.Would you consider both of us"
677,00:48:37.12,00:48:37.12,voting for Todd and having it bea tie?
678,00:48:39.58,00:48:39.58,">> I have to think about itmore, but I will guarantee you I"
679,00:48:43.17,00:48:43.17,will not vote for you tonight.>> Okay.
680,00:48:48.08,00:48:48.08,>> But I cannot guarantee whatthey will vote.
681,00:48:50.38,00:48:50.38,">> At this point in time,anything's possible."
682,00:48:52.58,00:48:52.58,"Anybody could be lying.I mean, it's hard for me to tell"
683,00:48:54.88,00:48:54.88,"who lies, who doesn't.Amanda said she had my back, so"
684,00:48:58.08,00:48:58.08,I kind of believe her that shesaid she wouldn't write my name
685,00:49:00.50,00:49:00.50,"down.But on the other hand, you never"
686,00:49:02.12,00:49:02.12,"can tell.Anything is possible, anything"
687,00:49:04.00,00:49:04.00,"can happen, and she might.You know, I really like you,"
688,00:49:07.12,00:49:07.12,Amanda.I really think you're going to
689,00:49:08.92,00:49:08.92,"do the right thing.Well, I mean, when you told me"
690,00:49:11.67,00:49:11.67,"that you had my back, I reallythought you meant it too, so..."
691,00:49:14.92,00:49:14.92,">> I did.>> Well, now is when I need you"
692,00:49:17.79,00:49:17.79,to prove it.>> Right now in the game my
693,00:50:09.21,00:50:09.21,biggest threat is probably Todd.Todd has made a lot of personal
694,00:50:12.54,00:50:12.54,connections with a lot of peopleon the jury.
695,00:50:15.08,00:50:15.08,"The jury is a younger jury, so Ithink he's my biggest threat"
696,00:50:18.25,00:50:18.25,right now.I'm at an awful crossroads.
697,00:50:24.42,00:50:24.42,"I've been going back and forthin my head: Denise, Todd,"
698,00:50:27.17,00:50:27.17,"Denise, Todd.And they both have their cons."
699,00:50:30.08,00:50:30.08,They both have their pros.But still I'm still undecided.
700,00:50:34.88,00:50:34.88,I don't know what I'm going tochoose.
701,00:50:55.12,00:50:55.12,">> PROBST: We'll now bring inthe members of our jury: Jaime,"
702,00:51:01.33,00:51:01.33,"Jean-Robert, Frosti, James,Erik, and Peih-Gee, voted out at"
703,00:51:08.12,00:51:08.12,the last tribal council.So let's establish something
704,00:51:16.04,00:51:16.04,"right off the bat.Amanda, is there any chance"
705,00:51:18.58,00:51:18.58,you're going to give upindividual immunity tonight?
706,00:51:21.00,00:51:21.00,">> No way.>> PROBST: Okay, so we know"
707,00:51:23.29,00:51:23.29,Amanda is not going to be votedout.
708,00:51:25.42,00:51:25.42,"It's going to be Denise, Todd,or Courtney."
709,00:51:28.29,00:51:28.29,"Todd, the four of you have beentogether from the beginning."
710,00:51:32.25,00:51:32.25,So what are you going to baseyour vote on tonight?
711,00:51:34.29,00:51:34.29,">> You know, tonight's vote isprobably the hardest vote,"
712,00:51:37.67,00:51:37.67,"because, like, we have beentogether since day one."
713,00:51:40.33,00:51:40.33,And it is coming down to who youwant to pit yourself up against
714,00:51:43.33,00:51:43.33,"in the end.>> PROBST: Denise, is it fair to"
715,00:51:47.17,00:51:47.17,"say, ""I want to get rid of thebiggest threat in this game""?"
716,00:51:50.17,00:51:50.17,Or does the biggest threatdeserve a shot?
717,00:51:53.08,00:51:53.08,">> Well, Jeff, I'm going to basemy vote on how I feel right now."
718,00:51:56.21,00:51:56.21,"Because like I said, I'm alwayson the bottom of the totem pole."
719,00:51:59.46,00:51:59.46,"There are still people that arein alliances, and it's still"
720,00:52:02.75,00:52:02.75,hard to break in even though areyou in.
721,00:52:05.62,00:52:05.62,"So, I mean, I have to do what Igot to do tonight because I'm on"
722,00:52:09.21,00:52:09.21,"the outside.>> PROBST: Courtney, do you feel"
723,00:52:13.08,00:52:13.08,that Denise is on the outside?Is that a known fact?
724,00:52:16.08,00:52:16.08,">> Um, I think that everyone'son the outside of some group."
725,00:52:20.21,00:52:20.21,"I mean, I spent the first halfof this game feeling that I was"
726,00:52:23.04,00:52:23.04,"completely on the outside ofeveryone, and a lot of times"
727,00:52:25.62,00:52:25.62,that's an insecurity problemmore than a reality.
728,00:52:29.58,00:52:29.58,"I mean, it's not necessarilytrue or false."
729,00:52:32.04,00:52:32.04,"It's, you know, all perception.>> PROBST: Todd, how important"
730,00:52:36.04,00:52:36.04,at this point is perception?You could feel you're on the
731,00:52:39.62,00:52:39.62,outside.You could feel you're on the
732,00:52:41.29,00:52:41.29,inside.You really don't know until the
733,00:52:43.83,00:52:43.83,votes are cast.>> Absolutely.
734,00:52:46.08,00:52:46.08,"I mean, the only one heretonight that should feel fine is"
735,00:52:50.33,00:52:50.33,"Amanda, because she has thatnecklace on."
736,00:52:52.42,00:52:52.42,"And like you said, until thosevotes are read, I'm going to be"
737,00:52:55.17,00:52:55.17,"sitting here playing with myfingers, shaking my foot."
738,00:52:58.12,00:52:58.12,">> PROBST: So, Todd, as we sithere right now, you're still not"
739,00:53:00.96,00:53:00.96,"sure if you're safe or not.>> No, I really am not sure."
740,00:53:04.79,00:53:04.79,"I want to think I am and hope Iam, but I've seen a lot happen"
741,00:53:09.38,00:53:09.38,"on this side of the game.People thought they were sure,"
742,00:53:12.33,00:53:12.33,"and they're not.>> PROBST: Courtney, how certain"
743,00:53:14.67,00:53:14.67,"are you that you'll be okay,you're going to be in the final?"
744,00:53:17.88,00:53:17.88,>> I don't think any one of thethree of us is sure about it.
745,00:53:21.12,00:53:21.12,"I mean, you got to be prettystupid to think you're safe at"
746,00:53:24.25,00:53:24.25,"this point.>> PROBST: Denise, why does it"
747,00:53:28.25,00:53:28.25,"make sense to keep you tonight?>> Well, I don't know why"
748,00:53:33.71,00:53:33.71,they... they shouldn't vote meout.
749,00:53:36.79,00:53:36.79,They think because I have kidsI'll have a better influence on
750,00:53:39.62,00:53:39.62,the jury and I'd be sympatheticto the jury.
751,00:53:42.21,00:53:42.21,So they don't want to keep mehere because they think that
752,00:53:44.88,00:53:44.88,that might weigh on the jury'sminds.
753,00:53:49.62,00:53:49.62,">> PROBST: Courtney, why, from astrategy point of view, would it"
754,00:53:52.21,00:53:52.21,make sense to actually keep youtonight?
755,00:53:55.92,00:53:55.92,">> You know, everyone is notgoing to be excited for me that"
756,00:53:58.12,00:53:58.12,I somehow managed to pullthrough.
757,00:54:00.33,00:54:00.33,"Like, you know, people are goingto be voting on if you're"
758,00:54:02.17,00:54:02.17,"strategic from the beginning, ifyou're a fan of the game, if you"
759,00:54:05.04,00:54:05.04,worked hard on all of thechallenges.
760,00:54:07.38,00:54:07.38,"You know, there's definitelyareas where I'm going to come up"
761,00:54:09.25,00:54:09.25,a lot shorter than the otherpeople here.
762,00:54:12.67,00:54:12.67,"Oh, and then there's my winningpersonality."
763,00:54:14.38,00:54:14.38,I'm sure I've ruffled a fewfeathers along the way.
764,00:54:18.12,00:54:18.12,">> PROBST: Amanda, was is a busyafternoon for you?"
765,00:54:20.21,00:54:20.21,"Were you very popular?>> When you're wearing this,"
766,00:54:23.21,00:54:23.21,it's funny how people change asthey... when they act towards
767,00:54:25.46,00:54:25.46,"you.Like, people's attitudes change"
768,00:54:28.17,00:54:28.17,when they know that you're notgoing home and you have a free
769,00:54:31.04,00:54:31.04,"vote that someone here may need.>> PROBST: Denise, is Amanda's"
770,00:54:34.96,00:54:34.96,"vote more powerful tonight, oris it just another vote?"
771,00:54:39.25,00:54:39.25,">> Well, I mean, whoever shevotes for, that could be the"
772,00:54:41.79,00:54:41.79,"power switch.I mean, it all depends on which"
773,00:54:43.96,00:54:43.96,"way she goes.I mean, I was talking to her"
774,00:54:46.04,00:54:46.04,"earlier, and at one point, she'slike, ""I got your back."""
775,00:54:48.75,00:54:48.75,"You know, I said, ""I got yourback."""
776,00:54:50.71,00:54:50.71,"And you know, I hope she voteswith me, and I hope she doesn't"
777,00:54:53.50,00:54:53.50,vote against me.>> I said I had your back a
778,00:54:56.17,00:54:56.17,while ago.I didn't say that today.
779,00:54:58.79,00:54:58.79,"I said... you know what I said.>> I know, I know, I understand."
780,00:55:01.54,00:55:01.54,">> Okay.>> PROBST: Todd, you have the"
781,00:55:05.67,00:55:05.67,"best grin on your face.>> You know, it was kind of sly"
782,00:55:09.71,00:55:09.71,"that she said you had your back,and Amanda's face kind of"
783,00:55:12.04,00:55:12.04,"dropped like, ""I never said Ihad your back."""
784,00:55:14.25,00:55:14.25,"And I was like, ""Oh, that'ssharp."""
785,00:55:16.67,00:55:16.67,"I mean, if it was said to me,I'd be like, ""Mm."""
786,00:55:19.38,00:55:19.38,"So that's... I was kind ofreacting for Denise, I guess, in"
787,00:55:21.50,00:55:21.50,"a way.>> PROBST: Amanda, has the final"
788,00:55:26.67,00:55:26.67,tribal council already started?Because Todd just took an
789,00:55:30.12,00:55:30.12,opportunity to make an editorialcomment.
790,00:55:32.62,00:55:32.62,>> I know.It has already begun.
791,00:55:34.96,00:55:34.96,And you just have to putyourself in what you think is
792,00:55:37.67,00:55:37.67,"the best position and do yourbest, and that's all you can do."

821,00:58:42.75,00:58:42.75,have won this entire thing if Ihad stayed in the game.
822,00:58:45.92,00:58:45.92,I'm just proud of what I'veaccomplished.
823,00:58:48.21,00:58:48.21,I think I did a great job.I never gave up.
824,00:58:50.58,00:58:50.58,And to make it 38 days out hereis a spectacular thing for a 40-

830,00:59:34.04,00:59:34.04,Do you want to call me out intribal again?
831,00:59:35.83,00:59:35.83,>> What do you mean call youout?
832,00:59:38.21,00:59:38.21,">> I'm so over this.Like, I could not be more over"
833,00:59:40.50,00:59:40.50,this.We just got back from tribal
834,00:59:43.17,00:59:43.17,"council, and I feel horrible.In essence, Todd made me look"
835,00:59:48.25,00:59:48.25,bad in front of the jury.>> This is the face that I made.
836,00:59:51.38,00:59:51.38,"I went, ""Ah,"" like ouch, burn,that hurts, but it's true."
837,00:59:55.21,00:59:55.21,">> Yeah, exactly.That's why I'm mad."
838,00:59:57.50,00:59:57.50,"Because I was like, ""Denise, Idid not say I had your back"
839,01:00:00.17,01:00:00.17,"today.""And I know how that sounded, but"
840,01:00:03.96,01:00:03.96,then you put in that comment.>> You're right.
841,01:00:06.12,01:00:06.12,>> Cut me off at the knees.>> I didn't mean it that way.
842,01:00:08.38,01:00:08.38,">> Well, that's how it came out.>> I'm sorry."
843,01:00:11.29,01:00:11.29,">> Like, I'm not retarded.I know what happened."
844,01:00:13.88,01:00:13.88,What happened was Denise wastrying to say that I told her
845,01:00:17.25,01:00:17.25,"before tribal council that I hadher back, but I definitely don't"
846,01:00:20.62,01:00:20.62,think I did it.I think... I had told her before
847,01:00:23.46,01:00:23.46,"that I had her back, but nottoday."
848,01:00:25.96,01:00:25.96,"And it sounded bad because itsounded like, ""No, I'm in the"
849,01:00:28.79,01:00:28.79,"not going to have your backtoday."""
850,01:00:30.67,01:00:30.67,"And then Todd made a face like,""Oh, my God, Amanda."""
851,01:00:34.54,01:00:34.54,>> I wasn't doing it to backstabyou.
852,01:00:36.08,01:00:36.08,">> No, listen to me.You can totally go in tomorrow"
853,01:00:37.46,01:00:37.46,and trash me as much as youwant.
854,01:00:39.12,01:00:39.12,">> I'm not going to!>> But I'm saying that's fine,"
855,01:00:41.12,01:00:41.12,because I know it's your game.But don't expect everything to
856,01:00:44.04,01:00:44.04,"be, like, okay if you do stufflike that to me, because I don't"
857,01:00:47.71,01:00:47.71,like people like that.>> I didn't...
858,01:00:49.83,01:00:49.83,">> I am honestly disappointedwith myself, because I'm in the"
859,01:00:52.92,01:00:52.92,final three with a guy who wouldstab me in the back in a second
860,01:00:56.21,01:00:56.21,"and who has pretty much lied,cheated his way into the finals"
861,01:01:00.62,01:01:00.62,with my help.So I feel like crap.
862,01:01:04.21,01:01:04.21,>> And I honestly mean that.I did not mean to turn it on
863,01:01:05.96,01:01:05.96,"you.>> Yeah, you did."
864,01:01:08.75,01:01:08.75,">> No, I didn't!>> That's fine, whatever."
865,01:01:12.04,01:01:12.04,>> You don't believe me.>> It really was an accident.
866,01:01:19.08,01:01:19.08,My last intention was to turn iton to Amanda and make her look
867,01:01:22.83,01:01:22.83,like a bad guy.So it was a complete slip-up.
868,01:01:25.21,01:01:25.21,"And you know, she, I don'tthink, believes me that it was"
869,01:01:28.75,01:01:28.75,"an accident, but it was.I wish that you wanted to"
870,01:01:31.92,01:01:31.92,"celebrate, because we're in thefinal three together like we"
871,01:01:33.96,01:01:33.96,planned.>> I have nothing to celebrate.
872,01:01:36.38,01:01:36.38,I don't feel like I...I don't know.
873,01:01:40.04,01:01:40.04,You guys can celebrate.I'm going to bed.
874,01:02:15.25,01:02:15.25,>> Day 39.We made it.

884,01:02:59.79,01:02:59.79,going to do.Carry it back.
885,01:03:01.75,01:03:01.75,"We'll eat the pastries and someof the fruit, and then we'll get"
886,01:03:03.29,01:03:03.29,into the hard stuff.>> And then we'll make fire?
887,01:03:06.17,01:03:06.17,">> We're cooking, Todd.Perfect."
888,01:03:09.46,01:03:09.46,We're cooking in a jungle!>> China's been a crazy
889,01:03:13.12,01:03:13.12,"experience for me.I'm glad that, you know, China"
890,01:03:16.46,01:03:16.46,"was as hard as it was.Like, it rained."
891,01:03:19.38,01:03:19.38,"It was so hot.You know, it is like a building"
892,01:03:21.50,01:03:21.50,"experience.>> Cheers to the final three,"
893,01:03:23.62,01:03:23.62,girls!>> Who ever would have thought?
894,01:03:26.21,01:03:26.21,>> No one.>> Not me.

896,01:03:30.04,01:03:30.04,"Like, my final goal was to makethe final three, and I did."
897,01:03:34.62,01:03:34.62,>> Can you guys believe that wemade it this far?
898,01:03:36.50,01:03:36.50,">> No.>> The three of us, really."
899,01:03:38.17,01:03:38.17,>> I am so happy it's you guystoo.
900,01:03:40.62,01:03:40.62,>> Me too.>> Now I'm getting sappy too.
901,01:03:42.96,01:03:42.96,I think I do have really goodpersonal relationships on the
902,01:03:44.62,01:03:44.62,jury.I have never been anything but
903,01:03:49.21,01:03:49.21,my own winsome personality thathas been called every name in
904,01:03:52.33,01:03:52.33,"the book since day one.So hopefully... I mean,"
905,01:03:55.46,01:03:55.46,hopefully that'll have somecredit.
906,01:03:57.17,01:03:57.17,"I made it this far, and thatshould get some respect from"
907,01:03:58.96,01:03:58.96,some people.I'm getting full.
908,01:04:01.12,01:04:01.12,>> I know.>> It's the most amazing
909,01:04:03.04,01:04:03.04,feeling.>> Let's burn Jean-Robert's $500
910,01:04:14.62,01:04:14.62,Louis Vuittons.>> Louis Vuitton.
911,01:04:20.12,01:04:20.12,"Let's do this.>> All right, ready, guys?"
912,01:04:23.92,01:04:23.92,>> Yeah.I think the biggest part of
913,01:04:26.58,01:04:26.58,"being out here in China is outhere, I have felt more emotions"
914,01:04:32.12,01:04:32.12,"and thought more about my lifein general than I ever, ever"
915,01:04:36.67,01:04:36.67,have.So I think China has almost
916,01:04:39.21,01:04:39.21,helped me to grow up.This is for 38 days of suffering
917,01:04:43.54,01:04:43.54,in the jungles of China and today 39 where we're the final
918,01:04:46.38,01:04:46.38,three!Burn!
919,01:04:56.04,01:04:56.04,"I feel like, looking at thejury, I stand an okay shot."
920,01:05:00.17,01:05:00.17,"I backstabbed and lied to a lotof them, but I was playing a"
921,01:05:03.79,01:05:03.79,game.And whether I win a million
922,01:05:06.21,01:05:06.21,"dollars tonight or not, I feellike I've accomplished a lot,"
923,01:05:09.58,01:05:09.58,"and I'm so proud.>> Honestly, I think it's"
924,01:05:23.71,01:05:23.71,anyone's game at this point.I think I have a 33% chance of
925,01:05:27.33,01:05:27.33,"winning, of winning the money.And I'm just going to go in"
926,01:05:32.25,01:05:32.25,"tonight, tell them the honesttruth about my game and how I've"
927,01:05:36.12,01:05:36.12,played.I think a lot of my fear of
928,01:05:45.12,01:05:45.12,failure and things like thathave been minimized because of
929,01:05:48.38,01:05:48.38,"this experience, and I'm readyto do it now."
930,01:05:51.29,01:05:51.29,"I'm not afraid of it.I'm nervous for tonight, because"
931,01:05:58.58,01:05:58.58,all of this is coming to an end.I know I'm going to be
932,01:06:00.96,01:06:00.96,emotional.And... it'll be good.
933,01:06:04.08,01:06:04.08,I'm excited.>> PROBST: We'll now bring in
934,01:06:30.33,01:06:30.33,"the members of our jury.Jaime, Jean-Robert, Frosti,"
935,01:06:43.88,01:06:43.88,"James, Erik, Peih-Gee, andDenise, voted out at the last"
936,01:06:49.71,01:06:49.71,"tribal council.Amanda, Todd, Courtney, welcome"
937,01:06:58.83,01:06:58.83,"to your final tribal council.After 39 days, the power now"
938,01:07:04.96,01:07:04.96,shifts from the three of you tothe jury.
939,01:07:08.38,01:07:08.38,Tonight they will decide who ismost deserving of the title of
940,01:07:11.96,01:07:11.96,sole survivor and the million-dollar check that goes with it.
941,01:07:15.50,01:07:15.50,This is your last chance toconvince them you are the one
942,01:07:19.17,01:07:19.17,who is most deserving.Here's how it's going to work.
943,01:07:23.04,01:07:23.04,You will each get a chance tomake an opening statement.
944,01:07:25.29,01:07:25.29,The jury will then get a chanceto address you.
945,01:07:28.29,01:07:28.29,And then we will vote.You guys ready to get started?
946,01:07:35.71,01:07:35.71,>> Yeah.>> PROBST: Opening statements.
947,01:07:37.62,01:07:37.62,"Amanda, you're up.>> Okay."
948,01:07:41.83,01:07:41.83,"Um, you know, I had a lot oftime to reflect on the"
949,01:07:47.42,01:07:47.42,"experience, the whole experiencetoday, and I feel very blessed"
950,01:07:52.50,01:07:52.50,to be sitting here.This was a hard 39 days.
951,01:07:59.00,01:07:59.00,And it's finally come to an end.And I came into this game
952,01:08:04.04,01:08:04.04,knowing a specific strategythat I was going to follow and
953,01:08:07.04,01:08:07.04,that I had to align myself withsomeone right away.
954,01:08:10.46,01:08:10.46,"So I aligned with Todd.My strategy then changed, like,"
955,01:08:14.00,01:08:14.00,"towards the end game, so I waswith people that I had a chance"
956,01:08:17.75,01:08:17.75,to physically compete against.And I did.
957,01:08:20.54,01:08:20.54,I won the last two immunitychallenges.
958,01:08:23.25,01:08:23.25,But there are some things I'mnot proud of that I've done.
959,01:08:25.83,01:08:25.83,"You know, I voted for somepeople that didn't think that I"
960,01:08:28.08,01:08:28.08,"was going to vote for them-- youknow, specifically James, Jean-"
961,01:08:31.58,01:08:31.58,"Robert, and Frosti.I am sorry if I hurt your"
962,01:08:34.71,01:08:34.71,"feelings, and I really respectplaying with all of you."
963,01:08:38.58,01:08:38.58,So... that's all I have to say.>> PROBST: Todd.
964,01:08:44.17,01:08:44.17,">> All right, guys.I'm stoked to be here tonight,"
965,01:08:47.17,01:08:47.17,"and you know, the first thing Iwant to say really is thank you"
966,01:08:49.08,01:08:49.08,for being where you are andhelping me to get in this spot
967,01:08:52.25,01:08:52.25,in the game.I know that I played a game
968,01:08:55.17,01:08:55.17,where I had to lie and I had tobackstab and I had to hurt
969,01:08:58.25,01:08:58.25,people that I cared about.And the main thing I can ask
970,01:09:01.62,01:09:01.62,tonight is that you are able tosee the difference between my
971,01:09:05.42,01:09:05.42,"strategic game and the relationsthat I actually built with you,"
972,01:09:08.17,01:09:08.17,"because the relations on apersonal level-- honest, real."
973,01:09:11.62,01:09:11.62,"The game level, the strategiclevel is what I came here to do."
974,01:09:15.38,01:09:15.38,"I knew coming in the game I wasnot the most physical, but I"
975,01:09:18.33,01:09:18.33,"knew that I could be the moststrategic, and if I did that, I"
976,01:09:21.17,01:09:21.17,could get here.This is my dream come true.
977,01:09:25.75,01:09:25.75,"I've lived my dream, and youknow, you guys have all been a"
978,01:09:28.08,01:09:28.08,part of it.And I'm happy to answer whatever
979,01:09:31.33,01:09:31.33,"questions, hear whatever youhave to say about me."
980,01:09:33.88,01:09:33.88,I'm ready for it.But I really do want to say
981,01:09:35.83,01:09:35.83,thank you for helping me in thegame.
982,01:09:38.46,01:09:38.46,It means the world to me.So thanks.
983,01:09:43.50,01:09:43.50,>> PROBST: Courtney.>> Okay.
984,01:09:45.75,01:09:45.75,"Hello, everyone.Unlike the other two people"
985,01:09:48.92,01:09:48.92,"sitting here, I was not alifelong Survivor fan."
986,01:09:52.75,01:09:52.75,No strategy.No idea what I was doing.
987,01:09:55.04,01:09:55.04,"And every single time that Ididn't get voted out, I was"
988,01:09:57.62,01:09:57.62,actually surprised.So that's what sets me apart
989,01:10:00.92,01:10:00.92,from these two guys.I figured out how to survive in
990,01:10:04.46,01:10:04.46,a game that was completelyphysical in the beginning.
991,01:10:08.00,01:10:08.00,"I started the game weighing 95pounds, and I was physically"
992,01:10:11.08,01:10:11.08,scared to be in this game in thebeginning.
993,01:10:13.25,01:10:13.25,I had to figure out a way tojust somehow manage to make it
994,01:10:16.17,01:10:16.17,"work for me, and I did that.Around the time of the merge,"
995,01:10:20.21,01:10:20.21,"things changed, and I sort ofgot my footing a little bit"
996,01:10:22.29,01:10:22.29,better.I did win a personal immunity.
997,01:10:25.33,01:10:25.33,So whoever saw that coming?Not me.
998,01:10:27.75,01:10:27.75,I was surprised.I made good alliances that
999,01:10:30.12,01:10:30.12,"worked for me.I was always pretty up front, as"
1000,01:10:32.71,01:10:32.71,much as you can be in thisscenario.
1001,01:10:35.25,01:10:35.25,"And I'm really proud of myself.And it think that, you know,"
1002,01:10:38.62,01:10:38.62,"whether or not you not you likeme personally, you have to give"
1003,01:10:41.21,01:10:41.21,a little bit of credit to thelittle girl who everyone thought
1004,01:10:44.25,01:10:44.25,would be gone in the first sixdays and is still sitting here
1005,01:10:46.79,01:10:46.79,"on day 39.>> PROBST: All right, jury, in a"
1006,01:10:53.08,01:10:53.08,"minute, you're going to get yourfirst chance to address Amanda,"
1007,01:10:55.50,01:10:55.50,"Todd, and Courtney.I'll give you a minute to think"
1008,01:10:58.17,01:10:58.17,"about what you want to say.>> PROBST: All right, jury, it"
1009,01:11:22.00,01:11:22.00,"is now your opportunity toaddress Amanda, Todd, and"
1010,01:11:25.75,01:11:25.75,Courtney.This is your chance to gain the
1011,01:11:28.04,01:11:28.04,information you need to make amillion-dollar decision.
1012,01:11:32.46,01:11:32.46,"You can address one, two, or allthree of them."
1013,01:11:36.04,01:11:36.04,"James, you're up first.>> All right, I just want to"
1014,01:11:44.62,01:11:44.62,congratulate you all.You did what you all were
1015,01:11:46.25,01:11:46.25,supposed to do.You made it to the final three.
1016,01:11:47.71,01:11:47.71,I'm not even going to be abitter betty.
1017,01:11:49.38,01:11:49.38,"Courtney, I just want to knowsomething good, so just a good"
1018,01:11:51.54,01:11:51.54,time that y'all had in the gameof Survivor?
1019,01:11:54.38,01:11:54.38,>> I think one of the best timesI had was actually the very
1020,01:11:58.04,01:11:58.04,"first challenge that our teamdid together, because when I"
1021,01:12:01.21,01:12:01.21,"picked up the pole the firsttime, I was like, ""Sweet mother"
1022,01:12:04.08,01:12:04.08,"of God, this thing weighs 50pounds; I'm going to die."""
1023,01:12:07.00,01:12:07.00,And then when we actually won itin the end and I stuck the thing
1024,01:12:09.33,01:12:09.33,"in, I was like, ""I'm not goingto be the first person voted out"
1025,01:12:12.75,01:12:12.75,"of Survivor!Oh, my God!"
1026,01:12:15.50,01:12:15.50,"This is crazy!"">> Congratulations."
1027,01:12:17.83,01:12:17.83,">> Thank you.>> PROBST: James, I have a"
1028,01:12:19.08,01:12:19.08,question for you.Why that question?
1029,01:12:20.67,01:12:20.67,">> Well, I mean, I just wantedto make it easier, because it"
1030,01:12:23.75,01:12:23.75,might be kind of rough in alittle while.
1031,01:12:25.42,01:12:25.42,"I'm not bitter betty.>> PROBST: Thanks, James."
1032,01:12:28.12,01:12:28.12,"J.R., Jean-Robert, you're up.>> Congratulations, guys."
1033,01:12:36.25,01:12:36.25,>> Thank you.>> Thank you.
1034,01:12:37.92,01:12:37.92,>> But I got a dilemma.I have a real problem here.
1035,01:12:41.79,01:12:41.79,"From day one, it hasn't been asecret that I haven't really"
1036,01:12:44.33,01:12:44.33,felt like Courtney isnecessarily deserving of getting
1037,01:12:46.96,01:12:46.96,"to the end, but I also promisedTodd and I promised Amanda that"
1038,01:12:51.88,01:12:51.88,"if you guys backstab me, youwould not be winning a million"
1039,01:12:54.42,01:12:54.42,dollars.So here I am.
1040,01:12:56.21,01:12:56.21,"( laughter )Okay, can it be anyone besides"
1041,01:13:00.42,01:13:00.42,you three?But it's the three of you.
1042,01:13:03.46,01:13:03.46,"Okay, now I have to make adecision."
1043,01:13:05.29,01:13:05.29,"So I got to tell you, tonight,my vote is live for any of you."
1044,01:13:11.00,01:13:11.00,"I'm asking you, Courtney, howcan I, in good conscience, give"
1045,01:13:15.04,01:13:15.04,"you my vote tonight?>> The game is outwit, outlast,"
1046,01:13:19.33,01:13:19.33,"outplay, and I have done allthree of those things."
1047,01:13:23.33,01:13:23.33,"And you know, I won an immunity.Like, that... did you win an"
1048,01:13:27.79,01:13:27.79,immunity?I came from the worst odds.
1049,01:13:32.12,01:13:32.12,I was never the favorite in thisgame.
1050,01:13:34.92,01:13:34.92,>> I agree with that.>> There you go.
1051,01:13:36.25,01:13:36.25,">> Thanks, that's a good answer.By the way, I started out this"
1052,01:13:38.38,01:13:38.38,game with the strategy of beinga brutal jerk and was going to
1053,01:13:42.46,01:13:42.46,try and come around.The second half of my game never
1054,01:13:44.71,01:13:44.71,"got into play because I wasblindsided, which brings me to"
1055,01:13:48.12,01:13:48.12,Amanda.Day 23.
1056,01:13:51.62,01:13:51.62,"I went to you, and I said,""Amanda, I will not backstab"
1057,01:13:53.42,01:13:53.42,"you.""At that point, you said to me,"
1058,01:13:57.04,01:13:57.04,"""I will not be putting your namedown on a ballet."""
1059,01:14:00.50,01:14:00.50,That's what you said to me onday 23.
1060,01:14:02.08,01:14:02.08,">> Uh-huh.>> Day 24 comes around, my"
1061,01:14:04.83,01:14:04.83,"name's on a ballot.I'm asking you, when you said"
1062,01:14:07.92,01:14:07.92,"that to me, were you outrightlying to me, or did you make a"
1063,01:14:12.92,01:14:12.92,commitment to me and just goback on your word?
1064,01:14:15.62,01:14:15.62,">> I was not lying to you.And honestly, I did not want to"
1065,01:14:18.75,01:14:18.75,vote for you.But too many other people did.
1066,01:14:23.21,01:14:23.21,"So honestly, it was a very, veryhard decision for me."
1067,01:14:27.50,01:14:27.50,It's not one I'm proud of.And I am sorry for lying to you.
1068,01:14:31.83,01:14:31.83,>> So you lied to me.First you're saying you broke
1069,01:14:33.42,01:14:33.42,your word to me.Now you're saying I lied to you.
1070,01:14:35.21,01:14:35.21,"What happened there?>> No, I broke the word to you."
1071,01:14:36.33,01:14:36.33,I didn't lie to you.I did not want to put your name
1072,01:14:38.00,01:14:38.00,down.>> Okay.
1073,01:14:39.96,01:14:39.96,>> But I am telling you I wasbetween a rock and a hard place.
1074,01:14:43.21,01:14:43.21,"I had no choice.>> Todd, day one, I went to you"
1075,01:14:46.75,01:14:46.75,"and said, ""Todd, you know what?You're the schemer here."
1076,01:14:48.88,01:14:48.88,I know it.I'm on to you.
1077,01:14:50.29,01:14:50.29,"You have the knowledge, and youhave the smarts."""
1078,01:14:52.12,01:14:52.12,We had a plan to send Jameshome.
1079,01:14:55.96,01:14:55.96,The best move for all of us atthat time was to get rid of
1080,01:14:58.21,01:14:58.21,"James, okay?In my opinion, you organizing to"
1081,01:15:03.17,01:15:03.17,"blindside me-- yeah, youblindsided me."
1082,01:15:05.04,01:15:05.04,"Okay, I'm out of the game.But I wasn't the biggest threat."
1083,01:15:08.96,01:15:08.96,">> You started to strategicallyplace ideas in people's heads,"
1084,01:15:12.17,01:15:12.17,which is what I wanted my job tobe.
1085,01:15:15.25,01:15:15.25,"And when you had approached meabout blindsiding James, I was"
1086,01:15:18.08,01:15:18.08,"like, ""Oh, no, he is catchingup."""
1087,01:15:20.38,01:15:20.38,So who then becomes the biggestthreat to me?
1088,01:15:22.21,01:15:22.21,You.What do I have to do?
1089,01:15:24.21,01:15:24.21,"Turn it around on you, who is anextremely great, strategic"
1090,01:15:28.04,01:15:28.04,player in your daily life.I had to get rid of my biggest
1091,01:15:32.96,01:15:32.96,"strategic threat, who was you.>> Guys, congratulations."
1092,01:15:41.62,01:15:41.62,Well done.( laughter )
1093,01:15:46.75,01:15:46.75,That was a good answer.( laughter )
1094,01:15:55.42,01:15:55.42,">> PROBST: James, I'm confused.What are you laughing at?"
1095,01:16:02.79,01:16:02.79,">> I mean, he shut his mouth.( laughter )"
1096,01:16:09.54,01:16:09.54,">> PROBST: Peih-Gee, you're up.>> All right, I want to vote for"
1097,01:16:20.21,01:16:20.21,the person that I think deservesit the most.
1098,01:16:22.96,01:16:22.96,"Todd, you talked about havingplayed a really strategic game."
1099,01:16:26.25,01:16:26.25,"You say that you played it hard.You know, I want to know that"
1100,01:16:29.67,01:16:29.67,you didn't just slide in herebecause somebody decided you
1101,01:16:33.08,01:16:33.08,"were going to be easy to beat.>> First, I didn't slide"
1102,01:16:35.75,01:16:35.75,anywhere.I started working day one.
1103,01:16:37.71,01:16:37.71,"Jean-Robert called me out andsaid I'm a sneaky, sly little"
1104,01:16:40.21,01:16:40.21,bastard that was going to getthrough this game and he had to
1105,01:16:42.71,01:16:42.71,watch out for.He was right.
1106,01:16:44.62,01:16:44.62,"Second, I gathered my numbers.I got myself Amanda."
1107,01:16:47.42,01:16:47.42,"I got myself Courtney, right?I was like, ""Good, I've got some"
1108,01:16:50.25,01:16:50.25,"numbers.""Pulled in Denise."
1109,01:16:52.25,01:16:52.25,"We get to the merge, we pick youguys off, then it's a head-to"
1110,01:16:54.96,01:16:54.96,"battle, but I still got mynumbers."
1111,01:16:57.04,01:16:57.04,"I fought.It's a glorious battle, art of"
1112,01:17:01.25,01:17:01.25,"war, yin and yang.I came out as a fighter."
1113,01:17:04.88,01:17:04.88,"That's just bottom line.>> Amanda, I'm sick of you"
1114,01:17:09.04,01:17:09.04,"looking at me with doe eyes, andevery time you've opened your"
1115,01:17:13.08,01:17:13.08,"mouth to any one of thesepeople, you sound apologetic."
1116,01:17:16.25,01:17:16.25,>> Okay.>> Because you wanted Todd to
1117,01:17:18.04,01:17:18.04,"take the fall as the bad guy,you know?"
1118,01:17:20.25,01:17:20.25,I want to hear what you thinkyou did that was better than
1119,01:17:22.96,01:17:22.96,what Todd did.>> Part of my strategy in this
1120,01:17:25.71,01:17:25.71,game was making sure that I waswith people in the end that I
1121,01:17:28.12,01:17:28.12,could physically competeagainst.
1122,01:17:30.67,01:17:30.67,James is a physical competitor.He had two immunity idols.
1123,01:17:34.12,01:17:34.12,That is a guaranteed spot in thetop five.
1124,01:17:37.17,01:17:37.17,"So I said let's... you know,""What about if we just... you"
1125,01:17:40.17,01:17:40.17,"know, we have to get rid ofJames."
1126,01:17:43.17,01:17:43.17,"It's either now or never,because he could pull out six,"
1127,01:17:45.46,01:17:45.46,"and he could pull out five, andthen he's in the top four, and"
1128,01:17:48.29,01:17:48.29,"then he's in the top three spot,and then there's only places for"
1129,01:17:50.75,01:17:50.75,"two of us."">> Uh-huh."
1130,01:17:52.46,01:17:52.46,>> So that is the most strategicmove that I made in this game.
1131,01:17:55.92,01:17:55.92,>> So the decision to get rid ofJames was your idea.
1132,01:17:58.58,01:17:58.58,">> It was my idea.>> All right, cool."
1133,01:18:02.46,01:18:02.46,">> PROBST: Thanks, Peih-Gee.Erik."
1134,01:18:11.04,01:18:11.04,>> I want to know what was theriskiest move you made in the
1135,01:18:13.88,01:18:13.88,game where you knew that it wasyour ass if you didn't.
1136,01:18:18.42,01:18:18.42,"Amanda, let's hear from you.>> Definitely I think my"
1137,01:18:21.50,01:18:21.50,riskiest move in this game wasthe decision to get rid of
1138,01:18:25.12,01:18:25.12,"James, and I really believedthat Todd and James had"
1139,01:18:28.21,01:18:28.21,"something going on.And you know, if James got in"
1140,01:18:32.12,01:18:32.12,"there, he was going to not onlytake a third spot, but wreck my"
1141,01:18:35.21,01:18:35.21,alliance that I already had.So that was definitely the
1142,01:18:38.12,01:18:38.12,riskiest move from my strategicplay in this game.
1143,01:18:42.21,01:18:42.21,>> I'm just trying tounderstand.
1144,01:18:43.67,01:18:43.67,">> Okay.>> Like, voting out a guy with"
1145,01:18:45.46,01:18:45.46,two immunity idols does notsound very risky to me.
1146,01:18:48.25,01:18:48.25,It sounds like a no-brainer.>> If he would have played an
1147,01:18:53.25,01:18:53.25,"idol, I would have lost myalliance partner, and then I"
1148,01:18:56.29,01:18:56.29,would have had to start all overagain.
1149,01:18:58.38,01:18:58.38,So it was a very risky move.We were all nervous at that
1150,01:19:01.42,01:19:01.42,tribal council.It would have changed the whole
1151,01:19:03.62,01:19:03.62,game if something else wouldhave happened.
1152,01:19:06.58,01:19:06.58,">> All right.Well, I think I've got what I"
1153,01:19:08.92,01:19:08.92,"need to know.Thank you, guys."
1154,01:19:11.17,01:19:11.17,">> PROBST: Thanks, Erik.Frosti, you're up."
1155,01:19:18.67,01:19:18.67,">> Todd, you know, I love you,but I don't even know if I know"
1156,01:19:21.71,01:19:21.71,"you.You lied up, down, left, and"
1157,01:19:24.21,01:19:24.21,right and all the way backaround in circles.
1158,01:19:26.12,01:19:26.12,Why do you think that your gameplay deserves a vote from
1159,01:19:28.38,01:19:28.38,Frosti?>> I think you're a great kid.
1160,01:19:31.96,01:19:31.96,My personal relations weredifferent than my game
1161,01:19:33.96,01:19:33.96,"relations.And yes, I did know that I"
1162,01:19:36.25,01:19:36.25,"wanted to take you in, be closewith you, make myself a buddy,"
1163,01:19:39.08,01:19:39.08,and put you on a jury.And what I built with you as a
1164,01:19:42.62,01:19:42.62,"friend was real.But yeah, I did do a big, huge"
1165,01:19:46.92,01:19:46.92,lie to my buddy Frosti.I'm sorry.
1166,01:19:49.67,01:19:49.67,>> All right.Hey.
1167,01:19:53.08,01:19:53.08,"Courtney, what's up?How you doing?"
1168,01:19:55.96,01:19:55.96,You look great.>> Thanks.
1169,01:19:58.67,01:19:58.67,"I dressed up for you.>> Now, I am really interested"
1170,01:20:03.38,01:20:03.38,"to hear what you have to say,because I think of all the three"
1171,01:20:07.21,01:20:07.21,"people, your game playinterested me the most."
1172,01:20:10.79,01:20:10.79,"Amanda, I assumed, was going tolie and backstab me eventually."
1173,01:20:14.71,01:20:14.71,"Todd, I knew, was going to lieand backstab me eventually."
1174,01:20:18.62,01:20:18.62,"But you, actually, interestinglyenough, surprised me when you"
1175,01:20:21.79,01:20:21.79,"lied, backstabbed me just alittle bit."
1176,01:20:25.17,01:20:25.17,"You also flat out said to me,unprovoked, that if my name came"
1177,01:20:29.58,01:20:29.58,"up with other people, you wouldtell me."
1178,01:20:32.92,01:20:32.92,">> Um, no, everyone was in ablind, panicked frenzy that I"
1179,01:20:36.92,01:20:36.92,"wouldn't vote for you.So all eyes were sort of on me,"
1180,01:20:40.04,01:20:40.04,"and, I mean, if I pulled youaside, you know, it might have"
1181,01:20:44.88,01:20:44.88,"made you feel a little bitbetter or a little bit worse,"
1182,01:20:47.08,01:20:47.08,"but I don't... I mean, I don'tknow that it would have changed"
1183,01:20:49.71,01:20:49.71,any outcome.But it wasn't like I went out
1184,01:20:52.54,01:20:52.54,and aggressively befriended youjust to take you out of the game
1185,01:20:55.54,01:20:55.54,"and then like, ""Oh, good, pocketjuror."""
1186,01:20:57.92,01:20:57.92,That's just... that's not whathappened.
1187,01:21:00.29,01:21:00.29,">> Thanks, guys.>> PROBST: Jaime, you're up."
1188,01:21:08.29,01:21:08.29,">> Hi, guys.>> Hi!"
1189,01:21:09.92,01:21:09.92,>> I have a kind of fun questionwhere you guys get to pull each
1190,01:21:12.62,01:21:12.62,other's dirty laundry out forthe other people.
1191,01:21:15.62,01:21:15.62,"I don't want it sugarcoated.So, Courtney, I'm going to start"
1192,01:21:18.54,01:21:18.54,with you.If you could start off by
1193,01:21:20.96,01:21:20.96,telling me everything that wewould be disappointed in Todd
1194,01:21:25.67,01:21:25.67,"about knowing and what he'sdone, what lies he's told, why"
1195,01:21:28.38,01:21:28.38,we shouldn't vote for him but weshould vote for you.
1196,01:21:32.17,01:21:32.17,>> I think airing Todd's dirtylaundry is pretty redundant.
1197,01:21:36.29,01:21:36.29,I think he wears it on hissleeve.
1198,01:21:38.38,01:21:38.38,I think every single person hereknows exactly every bad thing
1199,01:21:40.83,01:21:40.83,"that Todd's done, and that's whyyou're sitting over there."
1200,01:21:43.25,01:21:43.25,">> But what has he done?>> Um, well, he organized voting"
1201,01:21:47.88,01:21:47.88,"out Jean-Robert, and then heorganized voting out Frosti, and"
1202,01:21:51.17,01:21:51.17,then he helped Amanda withvoting out James.
1203,01:21:53.33,01:21:53.33,"I mean, there's not reallyspecifics."
1204,01:21:56.12,01:21:56.12,>> So he deserves the milliondollars more than you do?
1205,01:21:57.96,01:21:57.96,Is that what you're saying?>> I think that each one of us
1206,01:22:00.42,01:22:00.42,"has a different reason that weare deserving, and that's..."
1207,01:22:02.96,01:22:02.96,">> Exactly, but why is he notdeserving?"
1208,01:22:06.12,01:22:06.12,>> I think he might bedeserving.
1209,01:22:07.33,01:22:07.33,I think it's an equalopportunity.
1210,01:22:08.79,01:22:08.79,>> So Todd should get mymillion-dollar vote?
1211,01:22:10.50,01:22:10.50,">> If that's the way you...>> Okay, Todd, we're going to"
1212,01:22:13.12,01:22:13.12,skip that question to Courtneyand go why doesn't Courtney
1213,01:22:15.88,01:22:15.88,deserve the million dollars?What has she done?
1214,01:22:19.29,01:22:19.29,>> Courtney's voted the same asme pretty much the whole time.
1215,01:22:21.62,01:22:21.62,"I mean, I may have made the liesup and coordinated them."
1216,01:22:26.00,01:22:26.00,"She's voted with me, so she'sjust as much of a liar as I am."
1217,01:22:29.67,01:22:29.67,>> Except I didn't lie to youall.
1218,01:22:31.79,01:22:31.79,I just went along.>> She just went along.
1219,01:22:33.17,01:22:33.17,That's it.>> Not vote for her!
1220,01:22:35.21,01:22:35.21,>> The reason why you should notvote for Courtney...
1221,01:22:36.88,01:22:36.88,>> Yes.>> ...is because she didn't want
1222,01:22:38.04,01:22:38.04,to be here in the first place.>> So do you think she deserves
1223,01:22:39.67,01:22:39.67,it at all or do you think...>> I think I deserve it more
1224,01:22:41.67,01:22:41.67,"than her.>> Okay, great."
1225,01:22:44.12,01:22:44.12,"Now, Amanda, is there anythingabout Courtney that we should"
1226,01:22:47.58,01:22:47.58,know that makes her undeservingof a million dollars?
1227,01:22:50.50,01:22:50.50,>> I'm just going to be honest.I came into this and...
1228,01:22:53.50,01:22:53.50,>> I don't want...>> I know.
1229,01:22:55.12,01:22:55.12,>> Okay.>> I feel like Courtney is
1230,01:22:57.38,01:22:57.38,ungrateful.When she'd come back from
1231,01:22:59.08,01:22:59.08,"rewards, she'd just complain.And I... honestly, at the"
1232,01:23:02.46,01:23:02.46,"beginning, I didn't feel likeCourtney deserved to be here"
1233,01:23:05.21,01:23:05.21,because I didn't feel like sheput her heart into anything she
1234,01:23:07.96,01:23:07.96,did here.And that's just honest.
1235,01:23:10.25,01:23:10.25,>> Okay.What about Todd?
1236,01:23:14.12,01:23:14.12,">> Um, I feel like Todd is agreat strategic player of this"
1237,01:23:17.08,01:23:17.08,"game, but I feel if he's thatgood of a strategic player, why"
1238,01:23:21.00,01:23:21.00,didn't he play this game betterto where he didn't have to
1239,01:23:24.25,01:23:24.25,deceive and lie to all thesepeople?
1240,01:23:26.25,01:23:26.25,He lied too much for me.>> I don't know if I'd make an
1241,01:23:29.88,01:23:29.88,"alliance...>> Okay, now, Todd, this is your"
1242,01:23:31.04,01:23:31.04,chance.>> Right.
1243,01:23:32.33,01:23:32.33,>> You just heard what Amandasaid about you.
1244,01:23:34.08,01:23:34.08,"Do you... first of all, is whatshe said legit, or was there"
1245,01:23:37.17,01:23:37.17,"strategics behind you lying?>> I mean, yeah, I told more"
1246,01:23:41.46,01:23:41.46,"lies, and yeah, I made more, youknow, like, ""Let's go far"
1247,01:23:45.00,01:23:45.00,"togethers"" than Amanda.But I did the dirty work for the"
1248,01:23:48.79,01:23:48.79,"nice girl.>> And Courtney, do you think"
1249,01:23:52.71,01:23:52.71,she rode your coattail and theonly reason she's here is
1250,01:23:54.25,01:23:54.25,because of you?>> I would say that they
1251,01:23:56.12,01:23:56.12,"definitely played their gamestrategically, but I played mine"
1252,01:23:59.08,01:23:59.08,"more strategically.>> Okay, that's fair enough."
1253,01:24:02.17,01:24:02.17,">> PROBST: Thanks, Jaime.Denise, you're up."
1254,01:24:12.71,01:24:12.71,>> I'm glad y'all can look me inthe eye.
1255,01:24:14.25,01:24:14.25,That's nice.I'm just up here.
1256,01:24:18.04,01:24:18.04,"I mean, I'm a lunch lady.I dedicate my whole life to"
1257,01:24:21.17,01:24:21.17,"being honest, to being fair.You guys all came up to me."
1258,01:24:24.12,01:24:24.12,You all shook my hand.You all looked me in the face.
1259,01:24:26.17,01:24:26.17,"You all said, ""You're with us.""None of you wanted to be"
1260,01:24:29.54,01:24:29.54,standing up next to me.You didn't want to go up there.
1261,01:24:32.00,01:24:32.00,You thought I would play the kidgame.
1262,01:24:33.83,01:24:33.83,I believe that the jury wouldhave voted for me.
1263,01:24:37.21,01:24:37.21,"But because I'm standing hereand I'm not sitting over there,"
1264,01:24:40.04,01:24:40.04,someone has to give it to younow.
1265,01:24:42.62,01:24:42.62,"So this is what I'm going to do.Amanda has lied, even though she"
1266,01:24:46.04,01:24:46.04,"said that ""I don't lie.I'm not going to lie."
1267,01:24:49.08,01:24:49.08,"I'm an honorable person.""You have lied."
1268,01:24:52.12,01:24:52.12,You have not only lied to me.You've lied to Jean-Robert.
1269,01:24:55.88,01:24:55.88,You've lied to Frosti.You've lied to James.
1270,01:25:00.17,01:25:00.17,"Todd, he has such a deceptiveside to him that, you know, you"
1271,01:25:05.00,01:25:05.00,never know when he's telling thetruth.
1272,01:25:08.08,01:25:08.08,"You know, if you have thesethings in you that you can do"
1273,01:25:12.21,01:25:12.21,"that to people without eventhinking about it, without ever"
1274,01:25:14.50,01:25:14.50,"batting an eye, your conscienceneeds to be cleaned."
1275,01:25:19.12,01:25:19.12,You need to turn over a newleaf.
1276,01:25:21.00,01:25:21.00,You need to look inside yourselfas well and realize what you do
1277,01:25:25.25,01:25:25.25,"that affects a lot of people.Courtney, you're a very honest"
1278,01:25:28.83,01:25:28.83,person.You're very outgoing.
1279,01:25:31.50,01:25:31.50,You say what you mean.You mean what you say.
1280,01:25:33.38,01:25:33.38,"I can respect that.>> Thanks, guys."

1284,01:25:48.17,01:25:48.17,"it all sink in, and then we willvote."
