5,00:00:09.47,00:00:09.47,It's really hard being on the losing side of life here.

21,00:00:57.17,00:00:57.17,Kathy and Shii Ann tried to stir things up in an attempt to save
22,00:01:00.57,00:01:00.57,themselves. >> You need to start reacting.
23,00:01:03.93,00:01:03.93,>> I think we've got some last-minute scrambling going on

35,00:03:14.53,00:03:14.53,because she was my rock out here.
36,00:03:16.80,00:03:16.80,"And she was my one true friend. And now that she's gone, I don't"
37,00:03:20.77,00:03:20.77,have anyone here. I've got no one.

50,00:04:00.60,00:04:00.60,>> I know you do. I'm extremely vulnerable right
51,00:04:02.97,00:04:02.97,"now, and chances of me making it to the final two are slim."
52,00:04:06.87,00:04:06.87,"So, at this point, my best chance is to play as hard as I"
53,00:04:10.13,00:04:10.13,"can, call everyone on their game and stir it up before I leave."
54,00:04:13.63,00:04:13.63,"If you make it to the final two, I'll be shocked."

96,00:06:32.90,00:06:32.90,The idea here is to find out what you really think about each

106,00:07:05.27,00:07:05.27,make one chop on a tribe mate's row.

193,00:11:15.10,00:11:15.10,something. >> PROBST: You're taking some
194,00:11:17.10,00:11:17.10,"hits today. >> I'm taking some hits today,"
195,00:11:19.10,00:11:19.10,that's all right. >> PROBST: Next question.
196,00:11:20.50,00:11:20.50,Who did the group think was the most honest?
197,00:11:24.03,00:11:24.03,Reveal. Amber and Rupert say Rupert.
198,00:11:27.47,00:11:27.47,"Rob said himself. Correct answer, Rupert."
199,00:11:29.73,00:11:29.73,"Amber and Rupert are right. Amber, you are up."
200,00:11:32.13,00:11:32.13,"You only have two choices. Boston Rob has taken one hit,"
201,00:11:36.27,00:11:36.27,"Rupert has taken no hits. >> Sorry, Rob."
202,00:11:40.67,00:11:40.67,>> PROBST: Rob down to his last pop.
203,00:11:43.00,00:11:43.00,Rupert could put him out of the game right here.
204,00:11:44.87,00:11:44.87,>> I have to. >> You could put her out.
205,00:11:47.53,00:11:47.53,">> I could, but Amber didn't hit me."
206,00:11:50.70,00:11:50.70,>> Oh! >> PROBST: Boston Rob is no
207,00:11:53.63,00:11:53.63,"more. Boston Rob, have a seat."
208,00:11:56.57,00:11:56.57,"Here's where we're at. Rupert, you still have three"
209,00:11:59.00,00:11:59.00,"hits left. Amber, you only have one."
210,00:12:01.17,00:12:01.17,"If Rupert gets this right, he will obliterate you and win"
211,00:12:03.57,00:12:03.57,"the challenge. ""Who never shuts up?"""
212,00:12:07.23,00:12:07.23,Reveal. You both say Jenna.
213,00:12:10.23,00:12:10.23,>> Yeah. >> PROBST: You're both right.
214,00:12:12.43,00:12:12.43,"( laughter ) Amber, your hit doesn't really"
215,00:12:14.27,00:12:14.27,"matter. Rupert, you get the final"
216,00:12:16.00,00:12:16.00,honors. Take Amber out.
217,00:12:17.80,00:12:17.80,">> Nice job, Rupert. >> Thank you all, you guys."
218,00:12:23.30,00:12:23.30,">> PROBST: Rupert, with that, wins reward."
219,00:12:26.53,00:12:26.53,"Rupert, you will be in charge of the menu tonight."
220,00:12:29.33,00:12:29.33,The boat will come and pick you up.
221,00:12:31.10,00:12:31.10,You guys can now head back to camp.
222,00:12:32.87,00:12:32.87,\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> You guys gave that one to me.
223,00:12:52.07,00:12:52.07,"I appreciate that one. Thank you, guys."
224,00:12:54.07,00:12:54.07,>> That was awesome. >> I think the biggest
225,00:12:57.20,00:12:57.20,"thing that happened at our reward challenge today was,"
226,00:12:59.03,00:12:59.03,Alicia got all upset again. She was mocked by the tribe as
227,00:13:02.07,00:13:02.07,the person least deserving to be an all-star.
228,00:13:04.63,00:13:04.63,"Her ego took a blow, but you know, people say things for a"
229,00:13:08.33,00:13:08.33,"reason, so maybe she needs to take a look at herself."
230,00:13:14.23,00:13:14.23,"I thought they were pretty good. The, uh... the masks, too."
231,00:13:17.10,00:13:17.10,>> I thought the masks were pretty good.
232,00:13:23.57,00:13:23.57,">> You know, it's never fun to hear things about"
233,00:13:26.13,00:13:26.13,yourself that aren't flattering and then have to... the same
234,00:13:28.63,00:13:28.63,"people that said those things, you're stuck with them."
235,00:13:31.17,00:13:31.17,That's not fun. >> It would be nice to get out
236,00:13:34.27,00:13:34.27,"of camp tonight. Alicia, you okay?"
237,00:13:37.43,00:13:37.43,">> I'm fabulous, baby. >> Okay. If it helps, I'm"
238,00:13:39.93,00:13:39.93,"a big mouth. >> Yeah, but did everybody"
239,00:13:42.00,00:13:42.00,say that you don't deserve to be here and that you definitely
240,00:13:44.67,00:13:44.67,think you're smart and you're not?
241,00:13:46.57,00:13:46.57,Did people say that about you? >> Let's say there's only seven.
242,00:13:50.43,00:13:50.43,"Let's say.... >> It doesn't matter, dude."
243,00:13:52.07,00:13:52.07,It's already been said. Done. >> Alicia's very emotional.
244,00:13:53.70,00:13:53.70,"And when something upsets her, she becomes a huge grump around"
245,00:13:56.30,00:13:56.30,the camp. She's just being a big baby
246,00:14:00.40,00:14:00.40,about it. People are observing it.
247,00:14:02.37,00:14:02.37,People are getting annoyed with it.
248,00:14:03.43,00:14:03.43,People will vote you out sooner because they don't want to
249,00:14:05.60,00:14:05.60,"live with it. >> Don't, don't, don't, don't."
250,00:14:07.83,00:14:07.83,">> I know you don't want somebody to talk to you, but"
251,00:14:09.77,00:14:09.77,"I'm a mom, it's my job. >> Yeah, but you know what?"
252,00:14:11.70,00:14:11.70,"You're not my mom, so it's all good."
253,00:14:13.37,00:14:13.37,">> But you're hurt. >> Well, you know what?"
254,00:14:15.70,00:14:15.70,That's just the way it goes. I don't want anybody hugging me
255,00:14:18.93,00:14:18.93,or touching me or trying to... Leave me alone.
256,00:14:22.13,00:14:22.13,The only person that tried to not give me my space was Jenna.
257,00:14:25.07,00:14:25.07,Jenna's trying to put her arm around me.
258,00:14:26.77,00:14:26.77,Give me a break. Jenna and I have no connection
259,00:14:29.43,00:14:29.43,"at all. I mean, she's probably one of"
260,00:14:31.37,00:14:31.37,the people that voted that way anyway.
261,00:14:33.33,00:14:33.33,So she needs to save it. Jenna would be the last person
262,00:14:36.50,00:14:36.50,"that I would go to for consoling, the last person."
263,00:14:41.77,00:14:41.77,">> Listen, I know you got a really big decision, and I"
264,00:14:44.97,00:14:44.97,"know you're the most generous person out here, probably."
265,00:14:48.37,00:14:48.37,And just know that we understand where your position is.
266,00:14:51.60,00:14:51.60,But I'd like to have the choice is all I'm asking.
267,00:14:53.60,00:14:53.60,">> Okay. That's a great idea. >> Like if you said, ""This is my"
268,00:14:57.13,00:14:57.13,"decision for the order,"" and then just give us choices."
269,00:14:59.70,00:14:59.70,">> That's a great idea. You know, that's almost a"
270,00:15:03.03,00:15:03.03,challenge I wish I didn't win. This is what killed me on Pearl
271,00:15:07.40,00:15:07.40,"Islands was, I let the pecking order be known and then I was"
272,00:15:11.53,00:15:11.53,the next one gone. >> But don't be a martyr and be
273,00:15:15.53,00:15:15.53,"like, ""I'm going to take the smallest one and put everyone"
274,00:15:18.30,00:15:18.30,"else above me 'cause you need to be strong, too, okay?"
275,00:15:21.13,00:15:21.13,I just don't think you should give away your big one.
276,00:15:23.87,00:15:23.87,"I love Rupert, but strategy- wise, he is-- I don't want to"
277,00:15:27.97,00:15:27.97,"say not good at the game, he is, but he needs some coaching."
278,00:15:31.33,00:15:31.33,>> Seven of us... >> I do say Shii Ann gets the
279,00:15:33.67,00:15:33.67,rice. >> Shii Ann gets the rice.
280,00:15:36.10,00:15:36.10,">> But I think we keep ourselves strong, us four."
281,00:15:38.80,00:15:38.80,We have the numbers. >> They can't hurt us.
282,00:15:40.97,00:15:40.97,">> No, they can't. >> This adventure is geared to"
283,00:15:43.87,00:15:43.87,create hard feelings between people.
284,00:15:46.73,00:15:46.73,I hate being that person that creates the hard feelings.
285,00:15:58.53,00:15:58.53,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys! Welcome to the Romantica"
286,00:16:03.63,00:16:03.63,Restaurant. >> Thank you.
287,00:16:05.40,00:16:05.40,">> PROBST: Rupert, you're at the head of the table."
288,00:16:07.23,00:16:07.23,>> Cool. >> PROBST: Everybody else head 
289,00:16:09.07,00:16:09.07,"in this way and take a seat. So, Rupert, it's your reward."
290,00:16:17.03,00:16:17.03,"Good news is, you get your first choice of anything here you"
291,00:16:19.73,00:16:19.73,"want. We got a big piece of steak,"
292,00:16:23.10,00:16:23.10,"shrimp, all the fixings. The bad news is, you have to"
293,00:16:27.07,00:16:27.07,allocate the rest and somebody's going to end up with a very cold
294,00:16:30.07,00:16:30.07,bowl of rice and water from your own camp.
295,00:16:32.43,00:16:32.43,"So, let me go over the rest of your choices."
296,00:16:35.03,00:16:35.03,We have potatoes with tap water. Then we have a salad with tap
297,00:16:39.37,00:16:39.37,water that's been chilled. And we have a ham and cheese
298,00:16:42.30,00:16:42.30,sandwich with some sparkling water and a little bit of lemon.
299,00:16:45.17,00:16:45.17,"We also have a hot dog, sour kraut and orange juice."
300,00:16:47.87,00:16:47.87,Then we have a big cheeseburger and french fry plate.
301,00:16:50.57,00:16:50.57,"So, you can start with myself. You can start anywhere you want."
302,00:16:53.47,00:16:53.47,>> I'm going to start with me and I'm taking the steak.
303,00:16:56.97,00:16:56.97,">> PROBST: All right. >> Thank you, sir."
304,00:17:01.67,00:17:01.67,">> PROBST: Along with the steak, open bar, for you only."
305,00:17:05.97,00:17:05.97,You just tell him what you want to drink and he'll keep
306,00:17:08.27,00:17:08.27,refilling it. >> We'll start with a cerveza.
307,00:17:10.63,00:17:10.63,>> PROBST: All right. Rupert's starting with a beer.
308,00:17:12.50,00:17:12.50,"So, this is on you. It's your menu."
309,00:17:14.60,00:17:14.60,You're going to distribute it. >> I would like Rob to choose
310,00:17:18.77,00:17:18.77,next. >> PROBST: One ice-cold cola and
311,00:17:23.37,00:17:23.37,the burger. >> I'd like Jenna to choose
312,00:17:25.70,00:17:25.70,next. >> PROBST: Going right down the
313,00:17:29.03,00:17:29.03,line. Orange juice.
314,00:17:31.33,00:17:31.33,>> I would like Amber to choose next.
315,00:17:35.83,00:17:35.83,">> PROBST: Ham and cheese sandwich, sparkling water."
316,00:17:38.93,00:17:38.93,"All right, Rupert, three items left."
317,00:17:40.53,00:17:40.53,>> Alicia? >> I would love the salad.
318,00:17:43.20,00:17:43.20,>> PROBST: Salad and cold water. >> Thank you.
319,00:17:46.77,00:17:46.77,I probably would have chose that.
320,00:17:48.43,00:17:48.43,>> Very good. >> PROBST: That worked out.
321,00:17:52.07,00:17:52.07,">> Big Tom, what do you want? >> PROBST: Big Tom picks next."
322,00:17:55.03,00:17:55.03,>> Whatever... What is that?
323,00:17:56.23,00:17:56.23,>> Potatoes. >> I'll eat some potatoes.
324,00:17:58.13,00:17:58.13,"Potatoes, yeah. >> Leave the Asian girl with"
325,00:18:00.17,00:18:00.17,the rice. >> Yeah.
326,00:18:01.90,00:18:01.90,( chuckling ) >> We went to one of the
327,00:18:04.20,00:18:04.20,fanciest restaurants. They said it was five-star.
328,00:18:07.90,00:18:07.90,>> Please don't stab me. ( chuckling )
329,00:18:10.50,00:18:10.50,>> But I wouldn't hit a dog in the hind end with it 'cause
330,00:18:13.53,00:18:13.53,I got a tater and it was cold. >> Shii Ann... camp.
331,00:18:16.63,00:18:16.63,>> PROBST: Camp water and cold rice.
332,00:18:19.23,00:18:19.23,">> I hope it's boiled, both the rice and the camp water."
333,00:18:22.47,00:18:22.47,">> PROBST: A little bit of an awkward dinner, but it's a"
334,00:18:24.47,00:18:24.47,dinner nonetheless. You're warm for a little while.
335,00:18:27.30,00:18:27.30,I'll get out of your hair. Bon app\xc3\xa9tit.
336,00:18:29.63,00:18:29.63,">> Thank you, Jeff. >> This camp water tastes better"
337,00:18:36.23,00:18:36.23,out here because of the romantic lighting.
338,00:18:38.30,00:18:38.30,>> Good. >> You saw the people that
339,00:18:41.93,00:18:41.93,"ended up with fifth, sixth and seventh weren't too happy about"
340,00:18:45.07,00:18:45.07,"the politics that were involved, but hey, what can you do"
341,00:18:47.83,00:18:47.83,"about that? You win some, you lose some."
342,00:18:51.67,00:18:51.67,">> Those fries look so good. >> Thank you, sir."
343,00:18:58.93,00:18:58.93,>> I'm chewing my rice and thinking that I'm eating
344,00:19:01.60,00:19:01.60,that piece of steak that Rupert's holding in his hands.
345,00:19:04.00,00:19:04.00,>> I can't even look up at you guys.
346,00:19:06.43,00:19:06.43,>> Don't look up. Just eat.
347,00:19:08.37,00:19:08.37,Shii Ann's an absolutely obnoxious person.
348,00:19:11.50,00:19:11.50,"The whole time she's like, ""This rice is good."
349,00:19:13.27,00:19:13.27,"Oh, my gosh, ooh, look at that steak, I just want to watch you"
350,00:19:15.73,00:19:15.73,"eat it."" >> I wish I could give you guys"

356,00:19:54.67,00:19:54.67,"And Rupert, of course, had eight or nine beers and he was"
357,00:19:59.30,00:19:59.30,plastered. Plastered!
358,00:20:02.60,00:20:02.60,">> Thank you, sir. ( burping )"
359,00:20:09.07,00:20:09.07,>> Smell your napkin. >> It's so nice and soft.
360,00:20:11.80,00:20:11.80,( Rupert laughing ) >> I'm taking...
361,00:20:13.97,00:20:13.97,We're taking advantage of this. >> Good.
362,00:20:16.17,00:20:16.17,">> Rupert, keep drinking. >> Okay."
363,00:20:18.30,00:20:18.30,>> We really wanted to stay at the restaurant for as long as
364,00:20:20.60,00:20:20.60,"we possibly could, 'cause we just dreaded coming back here"
365,00:20:23.13,00:20:23.13,with all the bugs and the really long night.
366,00:20:25.43,00:20:25.43,"So, we told Rupert, ""Keep drinking as much as you want."""
367,00:20:28.13,00:20:28.13,We're just going to lay here on the table and use these napkins
368,00:20:30.30,00:20:30.30,as pillows and enjoy it. >> Rupert's a happy man.
369,00:20:32.73,00:20:32.73,"( Rupert chuckling ) >> Basically, Rupert"
370,00:20:37.50,00:20:37.50,"exposed our alliance of four. It was pretty evident, uh..."
371,00:20:41.40,00:20:41.40,as to who got what food. He's kind of sticking it in
372,00:20:45.10,00:20:45.10,"their face, which kind of shows me that he does trust myself and"
373,00:20:48.17,00:20:48.17,"Amber to a degree. >> \xe2\x99\xaa Chaboga Mogo, Chaboga"

375,00:21:17.53,00:21:17.53,to have a beautiful day. >> We are going to have a
376,00:21:21.33,00:21:21.33,beautiful day. >> I'm going to battle 'cause
377,00:21:33.90,00:21:33.90,"I got to, but I'm not going to kill myself to win 'cause"
378,00:21:37.43,00:21:37.43,I hope that I'm not on the chopping block.
379,00:21:40.10,00:21:40.10,>> I don't think you are. >> And I wouldn't mind seeing
380,00:21:42.47,00:21:42.47,you win immunity. >> You got to be looking at Rob.
381,00:21:45.03,00:21:45.03,"I would be if I were you. >> Oh, my gosh..."
382,00:21:47.03,00:21:47.03,">> If I were anyone here, I'd would be looking at Rob."
383,00:21:49.83,00:21:49.83,>> I've already talked to Jenna about that.
384,00:21:51.27,00:21:51.27,">> Of course, you have. >> But they're telling me"
385,00:21:53.90,00:21:53.90,"they'll take me to the final four, too, but I know I'll be"
386,00:21:55.47,00:21:55.47,fourth unless I win immunity. >> There are people here
387,00:21:57.23,00:21:57.23,that would stretch their vote tonight if they felt like they
388,00:21:59.27,00:21:59.27,had the majority. >> Yeah.
389,00:22:00.60,00:22:00.60,>> We know that. >> I know that.
390,00:22:02.30,00:22:02.30,>> There are people here. >> Let me... hand me...
391,00:22:04.93,00:22:04.93,"while you're over, give me that solid piece!"
392,00:22:06.50,00:22:06.50,See that good little piece right here?
393,00:22:08.17,00:22:08.17,">> Yep. So, uh... who's up on the...?"
394,00:22:12.57,00:22:12.57,>> Chop block? >> Yep.
395,00:22:14.30,00:22:14.30,>> ( whispering ): It's him before Shii Ann.
396,00:22:17.33,00:22:17.33,>> Rupert before Shii Ann. I was thinking about that today.
397,00:22:20.50,00:22:20.50,"I was looking at everybody today, and I was kind of..."
398,00:22:22.87,00:22:22.87,"sizing up. >> All I'm saying, we got..."
399,00:22:25.17,00:22:25.17,"me and you got to stick together, Alicia."
400,00:22:27.73,00:22:27.73,">> Absolutely. And I'll tell you what, though,"
401,00:22:30.13,00:22:30.13,"if either one of us are up against Amber or Boston Rob,"
402,00:22:33.47,00:22:33.47,"we're in trouble. >> But you know as well as I do,"
403,00:22:36.07,00:22:36.07,me and you are the lone horse here.
404,00:22:38.40,00:22:38.40,>> Yep. And those two are going to stick
405,00:22:40.47,00:22:40.47,together no matter what. >> They're lovers.
406,00:22:42.10,00:22:42.10,>> I know. >> But you know what?
407,00:22:44.00,00:22:44.00,"We may have not slept together, but we... we snuggled pretty"
408,00:22:46.83,00:22:46.83,close. >> That's right.
409,00:22:50.33,00:22:50.33,"We decided, Big Tom, Rob, Amber and myself, that we were going"
410,00:22:53.47,00:22:53.47,to stay together to the very end.
411,00:22:55.33,00:22:55.33,"That's four people. So, no matter what happens in"
412,00:22:58.13,00:22:58.13,"this tribe, we are four to the to the other three."
413,00:23:00.90,00:23:00.90,"Then there's Big Tom. He came to me and said, you"
414,00:23:03.13,00:23:03.13,"know, ""I can't sit next to Boston Rob or Amber."
415,00:23:06.37,00:23:06.37,"I'll never win. Maybe I should sit next to you."""
416,00:23:08.43,00:23:08.43,"And I said, ""You know what? Maybe you're right."""
417,00:23:10.37,00:23:10.37,But I didn't make any deal with him.
418,00:23:12.10,00:23:12.10,The only person I have an alliance with at this point is
419,00:23:14.33,00:23:14.33,"Boston Rob, and we shook on it. But do I trust him?"
420,00:23:17.63,00:23:17.63,Absolutely not. >> Here's the thing.
421,00:23:20.33,00:23:20.33,If Shii Ann wins immunity today...
422,00:23:22.13,00:23:22.13,">> It'd be a miracle. >> Yeah, I know, but still, we"
423,00:23:24.83,00:23:24.83,"have to decide. >> Rob, let's just face it,"
424,00:23:27.10,00:23:27.10,it's gonna hurt you more than it will me.
425,00:23:29.07,00:23:29.07,You got a better chance at winning than I have.
426,00:23:31.40,00:23:31.40,">> I need to win, like, almost every one, Tom."
427,00:23:34.67,00:23:34.67,I know what people think around the camp.
428,00:23:36.53,00:23:36.53,I know even though Rupert pretends he's all nice-- last
429,00:23:39.03,00:23:39.03,"night he gave me a hamburger-- I can read beyond that,"
430,00:23:41.63,00:23:41.63,"you know? If Shii Ann wins immunity, I"
431,00:23:43.93,00:23:43.93,don't know who we're gonna kick off.
432,00:23:46.33,00:23:46.33,>> You're worried about Shii Ann.
433,00:23:47.87,00:23:47.87,I'm worried about Rupert. Because he's the one that's
434,00:23:50.60,00:23:50.60,gonna beat you in an immunity. Shii Ann ain't gonna beat you.
435,00:23:53.60,00:23:53.60,">> All right. >> Uh, Alicia ain't gonna"
436,00:23:55.83,00:23:55.83,beat you. But we can't beat Rupert.
437,00:23:59.63,00:23:59.63,"You're gonna come close, but he's gonna beat you before"
438,00:24:02.20,00:24:02.20,it's over. >> Right.
439,00:24:03.50,00:24:03.50,">> And then when he does, you know who they want to get"
440,00:24:05.87,00:24:05.87,rid of? It ain't gonna be me.
441,00:24:07.43,00:24:07.43,">> No, it'll be me. >> It's you."
442,00:24:10.70,00:24:10.70,">> Yeah, we should talk, actually."
443,00:24:12.43,00:24:12.43,I have some news. >> I don't want to even hear it.
444,00:24:16.13,00:24:16.13,Honestly. >> That's fine.
445,00:24:18.17,00:24:18.17,">> There is a plan, Shii Ann, and it's too late for anything"
446,00:24:21.10,00:24:21.10,to change. >> Okay. I appreciate that.
447,00:24:24.57,00:24:24.57,>> Yep. >> PROBST: There's no denying
448,00:24:41.50,00:24:41.50,it-- we are getting down to it. There are seven of you left.
449,00:24:44.57,00:24:44.57,Today's challenge is for immunity.
450,00:24:46.60,00:24:46.60,Very important at this stage of the game.
451,00:24:48.67,00:24:48.67,It's a very simple immunity challenge.
452,00:24:50.63,00:24:50.63,You're gonna step up on a log. You're gonna raise your hand
453,00:24:52.77,00:24:52.77,over your head. Your hand is gonna be tethered
454,00:24:54.60,00:24:54.60,to a bucket. That bucket's full of water.
455,00:24:56.67,00:24:56.67,"When you drop your hand, the bucket tips, you get wet,"
456,00:24:59.80,00:24:59.80,"you're done. If you need immunity, the only"
457,00:25:02.23,00:25:02.23,"thing stopping you from getting it is quitting, and that's it."
458,00:25:05.37,00:25:05.37,"We got all day to sit out here. All right, Boston Rob, give"
459,00:25:08.30,00:25:08.30,it up. The all-important immunity is
460,00:25:15.13,00:25:15.13,back up for grabs. Take your spots.
461,00:25:17.27,00:25:17.27,I'll lock you in. For immunity.
462,00:25:22.60,00:25:22.60,"Everybody's locked in, and this challenge is officially on."
463,00:25:27.00,00:25:27.00,There'll be a little initial pain.
464,00:25:29.37,00:25:29.37,"You'll work through that. Just remember, there's not a lot"
465,00:25:33.63,00:25:33.63,"of slack in that chain, so if you drop your hand two inches,"
466,00:25:37.03,00:25:37.03,you're done. You have very little wiggle room
467,00:25:40.57,00:25:40.57,in this challenge. Amber's first out.
468,00:25:56.97,00:25:56.97,Grab a seat on the bench. >> I didn't even move!
469,00:26:04.90,00:26:04.90,>> PROBST: Jenna's out of the game.
470,00:26:08.07,00:26:08.07,>> You didn't need that immunity anyway.
471,00:26:10.27,00:26:10.27,It's all good. >> Nobody knows who's safe.
472,00:26:13.83,00:26:13.83,">> I know I'm not safe, that's for sure."
473,00:26:15.97,00:26:15.97,>> PROBST: Have a seat next to Amber.
474,00:26:19.20,00:26:19.20,"Big Tom, you're struggling. >> Oh, Big Tom."
475,00:26:31.20,00:26:31.20,">> PROBST: Big Tom, third person to hit the dust."
476,00:26:33.67,00:26:33.67,">> Okay, Rupert, you got to hold out before Rob."
477,00:26:35.77,00:26:35.77,>> PROBST: Big Tom's out of the challenge.
478,00:26:37.17,00:26:37.17,>> We can't let Rob keep winning these immunities.
479,00:26:39.00,00:26:39.00,>> Damn straight. >> PROBST: Have a seat next to
480,00:26:40.87,00:26:40.87,"the ladies, Big Tom. You're out of the challenge."
481,00:26:46.00,00:26:46.00,">> I see Shii Ann's arm moving a bit, so you guys are good."
482,00:26:49.63,00:26:49.63,">> PROBST: So, Jenna, I take it from that comment there's just"
483,00:26:51.57,00:26:51.57,no secrets in this tribe right now.
484,00:26:53.27,00:26:53.27,">> No. No, there isn't. >> Oh, there are secrets to"
485,00:26:55.40,00:26:55.40,this tribe. No secret on who they want out
486,00:26:57.53,00:26:57.53,"tonight, but there's secrets to this tribe."
487,00:27:09.23,00:27:09.23,>> PROBST: Alicia fighting through a little pain.
488,00:27:11.03,00:27:11.03,">> Be strong, Alicia. >> PROBST: First sign of"
489,00:27:13.30,00:27:13.30,weakness we've seen from Alicia on this.
490,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90,"Fight, guys. It's all about this right here."
491,00:27:19.20,00:27:19.20,That sound around your neck. It means you're in this game a
492,00:27:22.77,00:27:22.77,little longer. It means you've got a one-in-six
493,00:27:25.33,00:27:25.33,shot at a million bucks. Somebody gonna leave here with
494,00:27:27.97,00:27:27.97,this. The person who wants it the
495,00:27:30.73,00:27:30.73,"most. Fight it, guys, fight it. Oh!"
496,00:27:34.40,00:27:34.40,"Whew! I got a little of that, too."
497,00:27:37.23,00:27:37.23,">> All right! I'm glad. At least if I went down, I took"
498,00:27:40.07,00:27:40.07,you with me. >> PROBST: I couldn't be
499,00:27:42.10,00:27:42.10,"happier. >> Keep your arm up, Rupert."
500,00:27:45.63,00:27:45.63,Keep your arm up. >> I'm damn straight trying.
501,00:27:48.47,00:27:48.47,>> PROBST: And then there were three.
502,00:27:50.30,00:27:50.30,All three looking really strong. A little bit of rain starting to
503,00:27:53.60,00:27:53.60,"come down, cool you off a little."

505,00:27:57.63,00:27:57.63,little rain. ( thunder crashing )
506,00:28:05.63,00:28:05.63,Immunity is most definitely up for grabs.
507,00:28:09.00,00:28:09.00,Three people left. Anybody could get it.
508,00:28:11.67,00:28:11.67,"Shii Ann, I have to say, one hour in, you have not moved."
509,00:28:15.70,00:28:15.70,"Your body has not moved, your arm has not dipped."

511,00:28:20.93,00:28:20.93,taken your hand off your hip. >> Nope.

513,00:28:25.53,00:28:25.53,desperately. ( Jenna mouthing words )
