545,00:33:40.50,00:33:40.50,>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE GETTING RID OF JOHN WHILE WE
546,00:33:43.50,00:33:43.50,"CAN, BUT PHYSICALLY, JOHN IS AN ASSET."
547,00:33:47.13,00:33:47.13,SO IS THAT SMART RIGHT NOW? MAYBE NOT.
548,00:33:50.90,00:33:50.90,WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE JOHN HAS NO IDEA BECAUSE HE HAS AN IDOL.
549,00:33:54.53,00:33:54.53,>> JOHN DOES? >> YEAH.
550,00:33:55.63,00:33:55.63,>> HOW DO YOU KNOW? >> HE TOLD JOSH.

553,00:34:10.80,00:34:10.80,THE IMMUNITY IDOL WITH ME. I THINK I'VE DONE A PRETTY GOOD
554,00:34:14.33,00:34:14.33,JOB OF LAYING THE GROUNDED WORK. I THINK I'VE MANIPULATED THE
555,00:34:16.87,00:34:16.87,RIGHT PIECES THAT NEED TO BE MANIPULATED.
556,00:34:19.43,00:34:19.43,BUT THE TIDE MAY TURN AGAINST HE MEE.
557,00:34:21.10,00:34:21.10,WHO KNOWS? I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE
558,00:34:23.77,00:34:23.77,"A ""GET OUT OF JAIL FREE"" CARD. >> TONIGHT'S DECISION AT TRIBAL"
559,00:34:29.90,00:34:29.90,"IS ACTUALLY PRETTY HUGE BECAUSE IF WE DECIDE TO VOTE OUT JOHN,"
560,00:34:34.57,00:34:34.57,WE'RE FINALLY BREAKING THAT FIVE-GUY ALLIANCE.
561,00:34:36.60,00:34:36.60,AND WE'RE LOSING THE BIG GUY ON OUR TEAM.
562,00:34:40.27,00:34:40.27,"BUT IF JOHN DOESN'T GO HOME, IT'S BAYLOR."
563,00:34:44.30,00:34:44.30,BAYLOR WAS MY FIRST ALLY IN THIS GAME.
564,00:34:46.80,00:34:46.80,"AND I KNOW SHE'S WITH ME 100%. JOHN IS SUCH A WILD CARD, I"
565,00:34:51.37,00:34:51.37,DON'T KNOW. IS THERE AN EASY VOTE TONIGHT?
566,00:34:53.90,00:34:53.90,NO. BUT I HAVE TO GO WITH MY GUT.
567,00:34:56.27,00:34:56.27,AND HOW I THINK I WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE FARTHERREST IN THIS
568,00:35:02.27,00:35:02.27,GAME. AND I HAVE NO IDEA IF I'M MAKING
569,00:35:04.13,00:35:04.13,"THE RIGHT DECISION TONIGHT. >> Jeff: JOHN, WHAT WAS THE"
570,00:35:31.83,00:35:31.83,FALLOUT FROM THE CONVERSATION AT THE REWARD CHALLENGE BETWEEN AND

572,00:35:37.70,00:35:37.70,VAL WAS GONE. YOU SAID I TRIED TO SAVE HER.
573,00:35:40.30,00:35:40.30,"HE SAID I'M NOT BUYING IT. >> YOU KNOW, IF THE MERGE"
574,00:35:43.37,00:35:43.37,"HAPPENS AND JEREMY AND I ARE STILL LEFT, I WILL TELL HIM WHAT"
575,00:35:45.43,00:35:45.43,I DID WITHIN MY TRIBE TO TRY TO KEEP HIS WIFE AROUND.
576,00:35:48.67,00:35:48.67,"BUT SHE BLUFD SO HARD, COULDN'T BACK ANY OF IT, AND THAT'S WHY"
577,00:35:52.30,00:35:52.30,"SHE'S GONE, NOT BECAUSE I COULDN'T PROTECT HER."
578,00:35:54.47,00:35:54.47,">> Jeff: LEWIS WES, HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL KNOWING JOHN"
579,00:35:58.40,00:35:58.40,WAS TRYING TO SAVE VAL? >> NOT GOOD.

581,00:36:03.87,00:36:03.87,DOING AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.
582,00:36:05.97,00:36:05.97,"BUT IT WASN'T ME, AGAIN, SO I GUESS I'M ALL RIGHT."

585,00:36:17.57,00:36:17.57,TRIBE? BECAUSE ALL OF IT WAS DIRECTED
586,00:36:18.70,00:36:18.70,"AT JOHN. >> YOU KNOW, THE BALL HADN'T"
587,00:36:22.10,00:36:22.10,"EVEN GONE DOWN THE HOOP YET, AND NATALIE WAS ALREADY HOOTING AND"

589,00:36:28.60,00:36:28.60,RIGHT NOW. SO SHE CAN THROW IT IN OUR FACE.
590,00:36:31.80,00:36:31.80,WHAT ELSE CAN WE REALLY DO? WE CAN'T VOTE HER OUT.
591,00:36:35.20,00:36:35.20,">> NOT YET. >> Jeff: WELL, JOHN, THEY WERE"
592,00:36:37.13,00:36:37.13,VERY SPECIFIC. THEY WERE SAYING YOU ARE THE
593,00:36:38.83,00:36:38.83,"LEADER OF THE TRIBE, AND THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD GET RID OF YOU"
594,00:36:41.70,00:36:41.70,BECAUSE THE PEOPLE YOU'RE VOTING OUT AREN'T HELPING YOUR TRIBE
595,00:36:45.30,00:36:45.30,ANY. >> I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RAISE
596,00:36:46.73,00:36:46.73,MY HAND AND SAY I AM THE LEADER. I THINK SEVERAL OF US ARE ALL

598,00:36:53.07,00:36:53.07,THE BLAME FOR WHAT FIVE OTHER PEOPLE DO?
599,00:36:55.53,00:36:55.53,IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME.
600,00:36:58.00,00:36:58.00,>> Jeff: JACLYN WHAT IMPACT IT HAVE ON THIS TRIBE TO HEAR THAT
601,00:37:02.60,00:37:02.60,MANY PEOPLE THAT ANGRY IN A GAME THAT IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT

607,00:37:17.07,00:37:17.07,"IT'S LIKE, OKAY, THERE'S TWO OF US."
608,00:37:19.20,00:37:19.20,TWO GIRLS. I DON'T KNOW.

611,00:37:25.43,00:37:25.43,I'M SEEING SOME SHIFTING IN THE TRIBE.
612,00:37:27.90,00:37:27.90,"AND I THINK THE GUYS ARE KIND OF WAKING UP TO, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T"
613,00:37:31.07,00:37:31.07,JUST HAVE ALL THE GIRLS GONE. SO I THINK MAYBE ALLIANCES ARE
614,00:37:34.93,00:37:34.93,"FORMING DIFFERENTLY. >> Jeff: WES, IF JACLYN'S"
615,00:37:39.03,00:37:39.03,"INFORMATION IS TRUE, THIS COULD BE A BIG SHIFT."
616,00:37:41.90,00:37:41.90,SHE'S SAYING IT MAY NOT BE OUR BEST PLAN TO GET RID OF JACLYN
617,00:37:45.37,00:37:45.37,OR BAYLOR TONIGHT? DOES THAT CONCERN YOU?
618,00:37:47.43,00:37:47.43,>> NOT REALLY. >> Jeff: REALLY?
619,00:37:49.53,00:37:49.53,">> I FEEL LIKE MY ALLIANCE, WE'VE GOT A GAME PLAN, AND"
620,00:37:52.53,00:37:52.53,THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO.
621,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,">> Jeff: JOSH, CONCERN YOU? >> NO, BECAUSE THERE'S"
622,00:37:58.43,00:37:58.43,APPARENTLY OTHER THINGS GOING ON THAT A LOT OF US DON'T KNOW.
623,00:38:01.53,00:38:01.53,"SO I THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD ONE THING, AND SOME PEOPLE"
624,00:38:05.27,00:38:05.27,MUST BE BEING TOLD ANOTHER THING.
625,00:38:07.40,00:38:07.40,I GUESS WE'RE IN A LOT OF DISCORD BECAUSE NO ONE HAS THEIR
626,00:38:11.70,00:38:11.70,"STORY STRAIGHT. >> Jeff: BAYLOR WHAT, DO YOU"
627,00:38:14.53,00:38:14.53,THINK NEEDS TO HAPPEN TONIGHT WITH THE VOTE?

630,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,"GOING WITH THE FLOW RIGHT NOW, AND YOU CAN'T GO WITH THE FLOW"
631,00:38:27.20,00:38:27.20,IN THIS GAME. IT'S JUST-- IT'S HARD.
632,00:38:29.97,00:38:29.97,>> Jeff: SO DO YOU THINK THE PLAN THAT YOU THINK IS IN PLACE
633,00:38:32.93,00:38:32.93,WILL HAPPEN OR DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GET VOTES AGAIN
634,00:38:36.77,00:38:36.77,TONIGHT? >> I CAN'T TELL WITH THIS TRIBE
635,00:38:38.67,00:38:38.67,AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE NO ONE FIGURES WHAT AN ALLIANCE
636,00:38:42.10,00:38:42.10,ACTUALLY MEANS AND GOING WITH IT.
637,00:38:43.53,00:38:43.53,SO I THINK I'M GOING TO GET VOTES AGAIN TONIGHT.

644,00:39:04.57,00:39:04.57,STOP PICKING ON ME AND BAYLOR. >> Jeff: WOW.
