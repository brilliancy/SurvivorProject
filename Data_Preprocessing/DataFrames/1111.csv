1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00, >> JEFF PROBST: Previously on
2,00:00:02.17,00:00:02.17,Survivor... Jamie had it out with Gary.
3,00:00:04.79,00:00:04.79,">> You are calling me a liar, and I don't like that."
4,00:00:06.38,00:00:06.38,>> I did not just call you a liar.
5,00:00:07.71,00:00:07.71,">> Well, obviously, me and you are going to have to fight this"
6,00:00:10.21,00:00:10.21,"whole thing now. >> PROBST: The next day, the"
7,00:00:12.71,00:00:12.71,tribe learned they would compete for a night away from camp.
8,00:00:15.38,00:00:15.38,The winning team will leave here via helicopter to a beautiful
9,00:00:18.04,00:00:18.04,private home. The tribe was split into two
10,00:00:22.12,00:00:22.12,"teams of four. Survivors ready, go!"
11,00:00:25.62,00:00:25.62,"Lydia, Cindy, Jamie, and Rafe's team took an early lead."
12,00:00:28.67,00:00:28.67,Gary and Judd trying to hang on. But Lydia couldn't keep up.
13,00:00:33.50,00:00:33.50,>> I can't get my feet up. Steph and Danni surged ahead and
14,00:00:35.71,00:00:35.71,won reward for their team. ( cheering )
15,00:00:38.71,00:00:38.71,"Danni, Steph, Gary, Judd win reward!"
16,00:00:42.67,00:00:42.67,"Living in luxury, Danni, Steph, and Gary bonded."
17,00:00:46.08,00:00:46.08,">> Danni and I are, like, really similar."
18,00:00:48.00,00:00:48.00,She's a cool chick. >> Two hot girls get in the
19,00:00:50.46,00:00:50.46,"shower together. >> I wouldn't go that far, not"
20,00:00:52.25,00:00:52.25,right now. >> PROBST: And Gary took the
21,00:00:54.58,00:00:54.58,opportunity to make his move. >> I want to take the strongest
22,00:00:56.88,00:00:56.88,four to the final four. Because if Lydia goes to the
23,00:01:00.21,00:01:00.21,"final two, guess who's winning? >> We know that."
24,00:01:02.79,00:01:02.79,">> If Cindy goes to the final two, guess who's winning?"
25,00:01:05.08,00:01:05.08,"And do they deserve it? >> Let me ask you this, then."
26,00:01:07.42,00:01:07.42,"Numbers aside, who would be the next person you guys would want"
27,00:01:10.12,00:01:10.12,to vote out? >> Jamie.
28,00:01:11.83,00:01:11.83,>> PROBST: But Judd wasn't buying into Gary's plea.
29,00:01:14.71,00:01:14.71,">> Bonding with Gary and Danni is not going to affect my game,"
30,00:01:17.62,00:01:17.62,because I know what my game plan is.
31,00:01:19.71,00:01:19.71,>> PROBST: Survivors ready. Go!
32,00:01:23.12,00:01:23.12,The race for immunity was tight. It's Cindy and Rafe right now.
33,00:01:25.67,00:01:25.67,But it was Rafe who came away with the victory.
34,00:01:28.83,00:01:28.83,Rafe wins immunity. ( applause and cheering )
35,00:01:32.00,00:01:32.00,>> Good job. >> PROBST: With Tribal Council
36,00:01:33.50,00:01:33.50,"looming, Judd reassured Jamie that Gary was the next to go."
37,00:01:37.04,00:01:37.04,>> Are we good and solid? >> Mm-hmm.
38,00:01:39.83,00:01:39.83,We're going to vote for Gary tonight.
39,00:01:41.79,00:01:41.79,"Jamie's just very paranoid. I mean, he's not going anywhere."
40,00:01:43.58,00:01:43.58,">> PROBST: But Lydia, Stephenie, and Rafe were conspiring against"
41,00:01:46.67,00:01:46.67,"Jamie behind Judd's back. >> I know that, but..."
42,00:01:52.29,00:01:52.29,Gary is a smooth operator. >> I think we should do it.
43,00:01:57.00,00:01:57.00,">> I don't know what to say, you know."
44,00:01:58.71,00:01:58.71,"I mean... it's a hard decision. >> PROBST: At Tribal Council,"
45,00:02:03.67,00:02:03.67,"Judd was surprised to see his alliance turn on one of its own,"
46,00:02:08.21,00:02:08.21,"as Jamie was voted out. Jamie, the tribe has spoken."
47,00:02:12.21,00:02:12.21,>> Blindsided. Nice! >> PROBST: Seven are left.
48,00:02:16.46,00:02:16.46,Who will be voted out tonight? (theme song playing)
49,00:03:00.25,00:03:00.25,"\xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa >> Ooh, crazy, ooh."
50,00:03:43.29,00:03:43.29,">> I'm fine, man, I just, I don't know what to say, man."
51,00:03:46.33,00:03:46.33,"I wish somebody would have told me, man."
52,00:03:49.33,00:03:49.33,"I guess, I don't know. >> All I want to say is I wanted"
53,00:03:51.54,00:03:51.54,"to tell you, we all did, but why even put you in that situation?"
54,00:03:55.46,00:03:55.46,">> No, that's fine. >> Because you're close to"
55,00:03:57.25,00:03:57.25,"Jamie, and then you were going to feel super uncomfortable."
56,00:04:00.96,00:04:00.96,>> I'm just confused. That was it.
57,00:04:02.79,00:04:02.79,"I was just shocked, completely, totally shocked that Jamie got"
58,00:04:05.75,00:04:05.75,"voted out, man. We were supposed to have an"
59,00:04:08.75,00:04:08.75,"alliance of six, and it kind of went berserk today, and, yeah, I"
60,00:04:11.96,00:04:11.96,"was pissed off, man. Don't feel bad for Judd,"
61,00:04:15.46,00:04:15.46,"'cause Judd doesn't even feel bad, whatsoever."
62,00:04:17.25,00:04:17.25,"I'm telling you. >> I can tell you're, like, okay"
63,00:04:20.08,00:04:20.08,with it. >> I don't feel bad at all.
64,00:04:22.42,00:04:22.42,>> Here comes the backstabbing and lying.
65,00:04:26.83,00:04:26.83,"It makes me wonder, from now on, what the hell is going on, man."
66,00:04:40.88,00:04:40.88,>> There's no doubt that I dodged a bullet tonight.
67,00:04:43.21,00:04:43.21,My old ties in Yaxha at the beginning of the game helped me
68,00:04:46.83,00:04:46.83,"out, but Jamie did me a big favor by driving everybody"
69,00:04:49.92,00:04:49.92,crazy. >> I just feel already a breath
70,00:04:52.67,00:04:52.67,of fresh air. >> I just feel like all is right
71,00:04:55.79,00:04:55.79,in Survivor world. >> It is.
72,00:04:58.04,00:04:58.04,>> For now. >> Just for a minute.
73,00:04:59.88,00:04:59.88,( chuckling ) ( birds singing )
74,00:05:19.92,00:05:19.92,( snoring ) >> Gary was supposed to go home
75,00:05:30.25,00:05:30.25,"yesterday, but we had a little twist, and we did decide to vote"
76,00:05:33.83,00:05:33.83,"Jamie off. And I thought about it, you"
77,00:05:36.25,00:05:36.25,"know, whether I did the right thing or not, and I don't know"
78,00:05:39.21,00:05:39.21,if this alliance is still strong.
79,00:05:42.71,00:05:42.71,"I really have to figure this out, but I have to do this"
80,00:05:45.58,00:05:45.58,"carefully, because if I don't, I'm going to be the next target."
81,00:06:17.08,00:06:17.08,>> I woke up this morning. I had my head kind of looking
82,00:06:19.71,00:06:19.71,"out the lean-to, and I heard Gary working all over Lydia,"
83,00:06:23.71,00:06:23.71,"man, like you couldn't believe, man, just working her."
84,00:06:26.08,00:06:26.08,"And Lydia's like, ""Oh, yeah, yeah."""
85,00:06:28.46,00:06:28.46,Her eyes are bulging out of her head.
86,00:06:30.58,00:06:30.58,"""Yeah, Gary."" >> Mm-hmm."
87,00:06:39.50,00:06:39.50,>> Rafe. >> Huh?
88,00:06:42.50,00:06:42.50,>> Come here. >> What happened?
89,00:06:46.92,00:06:46.92,">> They were just talking, and Gary's like, ""So what do you"
90,00:06:49.71,00:06:49.71,"think, Lydia? What do you want to do?"""
91,00:06:51.62,00:06:51.62,"And Lydia is like, ""I don't know."""
92,00:06:54.21,00:06:54.21,>> She's not going to go with it.
93,00:06:56.21,00:06:56.21,">> I swear to God, dude. >> I think Judd has changed"
94,00:06:59.58,00:06:59.58,"since Jamie was voted out, because Judd's growing insecure"
95,00:07:03.08,00:07:03.08,"now and wants to find security with people, and so I think"
96,00:07:05.62,00:07:05.62,"Steph and I can give him that. Me, Judd, and Steph are pretty"
97,00:07:12.29,00:07:12.29,confident in each other at this point.
98,00:07:15.04,00:07:15.04,And I think Gary and Danni have managed to pull over Lydia in a
99,00:07:17.33,00:07:17.33,"real way. >> When we went on our reward,"
100,00:07:27.08,00:07:27.08,Gary had told me that he wanted Cindy and Lydia out of this game
101,00:07:30.29,00:07:30.29,already and they shouldn't even be here.
102,00:07:32.79,00:07:32.79,"Okay, now he wants them in the game, and he's trying to make an"
103,00:07:35.00,00:07:35.00,alliance with them. So that's a big lie.
104,00:07:37.21,00:07:37.21,"He likes to think that he's no part of this lying game, but the"
105,00:07:40.54,00:07:40.54,least person you would expect to lie is basically the biggest
106,00:07:45.12,00:07:45.12,liar. I need a tad bit more.
107,00:07:55.17,00:07:55.17,">> What is your strategy here? >> Okay, okay."
108,00:07:57.58,00:07:57.58,">> I mean, because we got to have four, so that's why I"
109,00:08:02.58,00:08:02.58,"wanted to talk to you, because I'd rather go with you than some"
110,00:08:06.04,00:08:06.04,"of them. >> I'm going with you, but the"
111,00:08:08.50,00:08:08.50,"thing is, the thing is... you know, I, I wasn't sure about"
112,00:08:13.25,00:08:13.25,"Cindy. Stephenie, Judd, Rafe, Cindy,"
113,00:08:16.50,00:08:16.50,"and myself, we're all in this together now, final five, but"
114,00:08:20.12,00:08:20.12,"the thing is I have to cover my own ass, you know."
115,00:08:23.17,00:08:23.17,I'm going to have to see how far this game is going to take me.
116,00:08:25.54,00:08:25.54,"So if somebody approach me with a better deal, I'm going with"
117,00:08:28.17,00:08:28.17,"it. >> PROBST: Come on in, guys."
118,00:08:39.88,00:08:39.88,How's everybody doing? >> Good.
119,00:08:41.67,00:08:41.67,>> Good. >> PROBST: Shall we get to
120,00:08:43.54,00:08:43.54,today's challenge? Today's challenge is for reward.
121,00:08:45.50,00:08:45.50,Each of you will have three pots filled with corn.
122,00:08:50.08,00:08:50.08,I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the Maya culture
123,00:08:52.25,00:08:52.25,and Guatemala. Each time you answer a question
124,00:08:55.08,00:08:55.08,"correctly, you earn the right to smash another tribe member's pot"
125,00:08:59.17,00:08:59.17,of corn. When all three of your pots are
126,00:09:02.00,00:09:02.00,"smashed, you're out of the game. Last person with a pot left"
127,00:09:05.33,00:09:05.33,hanging wins reward. Do you want to know what you are
128,00:09:07.96,00:09:07.96,playing for? >> Yeah.
129,00:09:09.33,00:09:09.33,>> PROBST: The winner will leave here and be taken to a true
130,00:09:12.08,00:09:12.08,natural wonder of Guatemala. >> Wow.
131,00:09:15.33,00:09:15.33,>> PROBST: It's a hot springs waterfall cascading down into a
132,00:09:17.12,00:09:17.12,"pool of cool water. So when combined, they create"
133,00:09:20.79,00:09:20.79,this spa-like environment that is very relaxing.
134,00:09:23.96,00:09:23.96,You'll have mojitos. ( gasping )
135,00:09:26.33,00:09:26.33,"You'll have skewered meat, shrimp, beef, chicken."
136,00:09:30.88,00:09:30.88,You'll also have a massage. Worth playing for?
137,00:09:33.25,00:09:33.25,">> Yes. >> Oh, yeah."
138,00:09:38.46,00:09:38.46,">> PROBST: Okay, let's get started."
139,00:09:41.25,00:09:41.25,First question: the Maya recorded their stories by
140,00:09:45.08,00:09:45.08,"carving hieroglyphics into stone monuments known as A: Stella, B:"
141,00:09:51.17,00:09:51.17,"Origami, C: Sanskrit or D: Docky Rocks."
142,00:09:58.96,00:09:58.96,Everybody reveal. Steph says C: Sanskrit.
143,00:10:03.12,00:10:03.12,That is wrong. Correct answer is A: Stella.
144,00:10:05.79,00:10:05.79,"Everybody else has it right. All right, Judd, you're up"
145,00:10:10.08,00:10:10.08,"first, take your swing. >> Don't do it, Judd."
146,00:10:13.04,00:10:13.04,">> PROBST: Already, the negotiating begins."
147,00:10:15.38,00:10:15.38,"Judd goes right to Gary. Nothing subtle about that, Gary."
148,00:10:20.17,00:10:20.17,>> No. >> Lydia.
149,00:10:22.33,00:10:22.33,>> How did I know? >> PROBST: Wow.
150,00:10:25.75,00:10:25.75,>> How did I know? >> PROBST: Stephenie down a pot.
151,00:10:28.62,00:10:28.62,Danni. >> Man.
152,00:10:31.88,00:10:31.88,>> PROBST: Stephenie takes her second hit.
153,00:10:33.33,00:10:33.33,Cindy. Cindy knocks Gary's second pot
154,00:10:36.96,00:10:36.96,down. Gary down to one pot.
155,00:10:40.25,00:10:40.25,"Stephenie down to one pot. Rafe moves to Danni, smashes"
156,00:10:43.62,00:10:43.62,Danni's first pot. Gary has two people to pay back.
157,00:10:49.08,00:10:49.08,Gary takes out Cindy. Next question: in the Maya court
158,00:10:53.46,00:10:53.46,"ball game, members of the losing team were frequently killed."
159,00:10:57.42,00:10:57.42,"True or false, often they would be decapitated and their heads"
160,00:11:01.42,00:11:01.42,would then be encased to be used as the ball in future games.
161,00:11:08.12,00:11:08.12,Everybody reveal. Steph takes a look down to see
162,00:11:14.12,00:11:14.12,"what other people are doing. Makes her choice, and she makes"
163,00:11:16.83,00:11:16.83,the wrong choice. It is true.
164,00:11:20.46,00:11:20.46,Lydia has it right. Danni has it right.
165,00:11:23.04,00:11:23.04,Cindy has it right. That's it.
166,00:11:25.12,00:11:25.12,"Lydia, take your whack. Lydia could put somebody out of"
167,00:11:28.25,00:11:28.25,this game... and she does. Steph the first casualty.
168,00:11:34.08,00:11:34.08,>> Jealousy gets you nowhere. >> I'm hungry. I want to eat.
169,00:11:37.92,00:11:37.92,>> We'll see about that. >> PROBST: Steph not happy at
170,00:11:40.42,00:11:40.42,"all with that, Lydia. >> I haven't eaten."
171,00:11:43.25,00:11:43.25,"Steph ate three times. >> So did Gary, so did Danni."
172,00:11:47.21,00:11:47.21,>> PROBST: Game's getting interesting.
173,00:11:49.88,00:11:49.88,"Danni, take your shot. Judd takes his first hit."
174,00:11:54.38,00:11:54.38,"Cindy, what's she going to do? Boy, she's winding up."
175,00:12:00.38,00:12:00.38,Wow. Cindy takes Gary out of the
176,00:12:03.25,00:12:03.25,game. Gary not happy.
177,00:12:06.00,00:12:06.00,"Just like that, we're down to five."
178,00:12:08.17,00:12:08.17,"Next question, the ancient Maya believed that the gods fashioned"
179,00:12:11.46,00:12:11.46,"man from which spiritually important crop, A: Coffee, B:"
180,00:12:17.38,00:12:17.38,"Cocoa Beans, C: Corn, or D: Ramon Nuts."
181,00:12:22.25,00:12:22.25,Judd trying to see any clue of what to put down.
182,00:12:25.83,00:12:25.83,"Everybody reveal. Judd says, B: Cocoa Beans."
183,00:12:32.38,00:12:32.38,"No, the correct answer was C: Corn."
184,00:12:35.17,00:12:35.17,Everybody else has it right. Judd takes his second hit.
185,00:12:40.38,00:12:40.38,"Danni could put Judd out of this, and she does."
186,00:12:44.21,00:12:44.21,Judd takes a seat on the bench. Cindy heading down to the end.

188,00:12:53.21,00:12:53.21,does. >> Come join the loser's lounge.
189,00:12:56.04,00:12:56.04,>> PROBST: Danni takes a seat on the bench.
190,00:12:58.04,00:12:58.04,We are now down to three. Lydia has all three pots left.
191,00:13:01.50,00:13:01.50,Rafe has all three pots left. Cindy has two pots left.
192,00:13:05.00,00:13:05.00,"Which of the following countries does not border Guatemala, A: is"

195,00:13:22.71,00:13:22.71,Costa Rica. Take your shot.
196,00:13:27.50,00:13:27.50,Rafe breaks Lydia's first pot. Lydia and Cindy down to two
197,00:13:31.25,00:13:31.25,pots. Rafe still has all three.
198,00:13:33.58,00:13:33.58,True or false: the temples of Tikal are the only ancient Maya

201,00:13:47.04,00:13:47.04,Everybody says false. I'm so glad everybody got it
202,00:13:49.17,00:13:49.17,right. There was no modern machinery in
203,00:13:51.25,00:13:51.25,"ancient Maya. Cindy, you're up."
204,00:13:55.50,00:13:55.50,"Big decision now. Does Rafe get his first hit, or"
205,00:13:59.71,00:13:59.71,does Lydia take her second? Cindy knocks Lydia's second pot
206,00:14:05.42,00:14:05.42,"out. And with that, Lydia is out of"
207,00:14:09.08,00:14:09.08,"the game. But, Lydia, because you got it"
208,00:14:12.08,00:14:12.08,"right, you get your last licks. Two people to pay back, only one"
209,00:14:15.21,00:14:15.21,swing to do it with. Lydia is done.
210,00:14:20.17,00:14:20.17,"Does her damage, takes a seat on the bench."
211,00:14:22.79,00:14:22.79,We are now down to two. Big reward at stake.
212,00:14:26.25,00:14:26.25,Both of you have two pots left. True or false: there are 30

215,00:14:40.29,00:14:40.29,Correct answer is... true.
216,00:14:43.08,00:14:43.08,Cindy got it right. >> Wow.
217,00:14:48.21,00:14:48.21,">> PROBST: Just like that, Rafe is down to one pot."
218,00:14:51.08,00:14:51.08,"If Cindy gets it right, regardless what you do, Cindy"
219,00:14:54.17,00:14:54.17,wins. True or false: the most active

222,00:15:06.25,00:15:06.25,Cindy says false. Crocodiles are most active not
223,00:15:11.71,00:15:11.71,"at dawn, but at dusk. The answer is false."
224,00:15:14.83,00:15:14.83,>> Cindy! Whoo!
225,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67,">> PROBST: So here is the deal. You are going to leave here, go"
226,00:15:23.92,00:15:23.92,"to a beautiful place. Got some food, got some drink,"
227,00:15:27.38,00:15:27.38,got a massage. You got one person going with
228,00:15:30.04,00:15:30.04,you. ( groans )
229,00:15:35.71,00:15:35.71,>> This is the most difficult decision of the whole game.
230,00:15:38.12,00:15:38.12,Judd's sitting over there praying.
231,00:15:40.08,00:15:40.08,( laughter ) >> PROBST: Pick one.
232,00:15:46.92,00:15:46.92,>> I'll go with Rafe. >> PROBST: Rafe is going.
233,00:15:50.17,00:15:50.17,"Cindy and Rafe, heading off to a great reward."
234,00:15:53.67,00:15:53.67,"Steph, Judd, Lydia, Danni, Gary, head on back to camp."
235,00:16:16.62,00:16:16.62,">> We get to the challenge, and, lo and behold, I'm the first"
236,00:16:19.04,00:16:19.04,one out. Lydia hits me twice.
237,00:16:21.08,00:16:21.08,Danni hits me once. Knocked me right out.
238,00:16:23.29,00:16:23.29,"Lydia was fed up because I've won so many food rewards, and"
239,00:16:26.04,00:16:26.04,"she's starving out here. Well, boo-hoo for Lydia."
240,00:16:29.42,00:16:29.42,I'm sick of hearing your crap. You're lucky you're still in the
241,00:16:31.38,00:16:31.38,"game. I just want to say, just to get"
242,00:16:34.12,00:16:34.12,"it out there, I had burgers, burgers, burgers."
243,00:16:39.58,00:16:39.58,"Feast, feast, you had pizza, you had pasta."
244,00:16:42.12,00:16:42.12,>> The only one that didn't eat here was Lydia.
245,00:16:43.75,00:16:43.75,">> We've all had three, and then I chose, personally, not to"
246,00:16:46.83,00:16:46.83,compete in the immunity challenge.
247,00:16:49.25,00:16:49.25,"I put my ass on the line, and I ate, so I had one extra, and"
248,00:16:51.21,00:16:51.21,"that was not a reward. 'Cause everybody is talking,"
249,00:16:53.08,00:16:53.08,"""Stephenie's eating so much. I'm so upset Stephenie is"
250,00:16:55.50,00:16:55.50,"winning all these rewards."" >> I wasn't..."
251,00:16:57.38,00:16:57.38,>> And I don't want to hear anymore about it.
252,00:16:59.08,00:16:59.08,"There's a winner and a loser in this game, and if you're gonna"
253,00:17:01.42,00:17:01.42,"be jealous, then you're an idiot."
254,00:17:03.42,00:17:03.42,I made that clear as soon as I got back to camp.
255,00:17:05.08,00:17:05.08,I shut everybody up right then and there.
256,00:17:07.17,00:17:07.17,You think that a challenge like this isn't going to show me
257,00:17:09.17,00:17:09.17,"where your loyalties lie, you are sadly mistaken."
258,00:17:11.17,00:17:11.17,"I've had three, you've had three, you've had three, you've"
259,00:17:13.17,00:17:13.17,had three. We're all pretty even.
260,00:17:15.17,00:17:15.17,">> Which I don't care, one way or the other."
261,00:17:16.58,00:17:16.58,But a pizza compared to what you ate was nothing.
262,00:17:19.21,00:17:19.21,Lydia was very upset because Steph eats a stinking ton.
263,00:17:24.79,00:17:24.79,I don't think she's lost weight. She eats so much corn and nuts
264,00:17:27.33,00:17:27.33,it's amazing. So I know she is strong.
265,00:17:31.71,00:17:31.71,"And she needs to be looked at at these challenges, 'cause she can"
266,00:17:34.08,00:17:34.08,win. >> I'm not going to take
267,00:17:35.58,00:17:35.58,"anything personal, I'm not, but when I hear people saying that"
268,00:17:38.00,00:17:38.00,I've eaten too much and that they're starving and that I get
269,00:17:39.83,00:17:39.83,"all the rewards, I just want to set the record straight that"
270,00:17:43.38,00:17:43.38,we're pretty damn even now. >> This wasn't personal.
271,00:17:45.75,00:17:45.75,"If I won, I was going to take Rafe, because I felt Rafe and I"
272,00:17:49.33,00:17:49.33,"were the only two that hadn't had a meal, and that was the"
273,00:17:51.42,00:17:51.42,only reason why. >> Everything in this game is
274,00:17:54.17,00:17:54.17,"personal, man. I mean, I hear people, I see"
275,00:17:56.92,00:17:56.92,people every day lying through their damn teeth who I least
276,00:18:00.58,00:18:00.58,"expect to lie, so when you say nothing is personal, everything"
277,00:18:03.92,00:18:03.92,"is personal, man. >> Stephenie was the first one"
278,00:18:07.04,00:18:07.04,"out, and I think she was pretty upset."
279,00:18:09.00,00:18:09.00,I wanted to give somebody else a chance for the food reward that
280,00:18:12.50,00:18:12.50,"hadn't had a chance, you know? Right now, everybody is putting"
281,00:18:16.58,00:18:16.58,Stephenie up on a pedestal. Everybody is knowing that
282,00:18:20.83,00:18:20.83,"Stephenie is the biggest threat, but nobody is doing anything"
283,00:18:23.58,00:18:23.58,"about it. >> Well, I'm glad that's over,"
284,00:18:26.12,00:18:26.12,and if you think I'm eating too much or getting too many
285,00:18:28.29,00:18:28.29,"rewards, just tell me next time, because I'm going to hear about"
286,00:18:30.38,00:18:30.38,it. >> This is amazing.
287,00:18:43.29,00:18:43.29,">> Hola. >> Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful."
288,00:18:46.12,00:18:46.12,">> I'm just, like, completely ecstatic that I actually won a"
289,00:18:49.29,00:18:49.29,"reward, a really cool reward. And I couldn't have picked a"
290,00:18:53.12,00:18:53.12,"better person to share it with. >> Oh, gracias."
291,00:19:04.46,00:19:04.46,>> There was this gorgeous waterfall and then a huge
292,00:19:07.12,00:19:07.12,platter of shishkabobs and mojito pitchers and then a
293,00:19:11.04,00:19:11.04,"massage table. We were like, ""Do we eat first?"
294,00:19:13.33,00:19:13.33,"Do we get massages? What do we do?"""
295,00:19:15.38,00:19:15.38,"And, of course, we decided to eat first, because, I mean, we"
296,00:19:17.50,00:19:17.50,had to. To the first of many feasts
297,00:19:21.25,00:19:21.25,and exotic locations together. >> Cheers.
298,00:19:27.58,00:19:27.58,">> We have to eat all of this. >> Look, watermelon."
299,00:19:30.38,00:19:30.38,"Oh, this is so freakin' good. >> I just can't believe we're"
300,00:19:34.21,00:19:34.21,"eating. >> So, back at camp, Lydia is"
301,00:19:37.50,00:19:37.50,probably really irritated that she's not eating.
302,00:19:41.42,00:19:41.42,Gary is mad because I took him out.
303,00:19:44.12,00:19:44.12,Stephenie and Judd are probably sitting up on the ruins laughing
304,00:19:46.58,00:19:46.58,at it all. >> Mm-hmm.
305,00:19:48.29,00:19:48.29,>> Lydia is so easily swayed. >> Spending too much time with
306,00:19:51.50,00:19:51.50,"Gary, getting brainwashed. >> It was kind of like a flood"
307,00:19:54.62,00:19:54.62,"of strategy out of both of us. After that, it was like, you"
308,00:19:58.42,00:19:58.42,"know, Cindy and I are kind of in this together for better or"
309,00:20:00.83,00:20:00.83,"for worse. >> Oh, you can feel the warm"
310,00:20:11.17,00:20:11.17,water-- come on. The water coming down out of the
311,00:20:15.29,00:20:15.29,"waterfall was hot, not warm, hot like taking-a-shower hot."
312,00:20:18.79,00:20:18.79,"And then the water down underneath was cold, and it was"
313,00:20:23.25,00:20:23.25,crystal clear. It was one of the coolest things
314,00:20:26.29,00:20:26.29,you could possibly see. >> We went into the waterfall
315,00:20:32.96,00:20:32.96,"together. You know, I was holding her and"
316,00:20:35.33,00:20:35.33,"helping her move. And I am a really touchy person,"
317,00:20:37.42,00:20:37.42,"and Cindy is not, so it was nice to kind of be able to, like,"
318,00:20:41.12,00:20:41.12,feel that touchy-feely kind of connection with Cindy.
319,00:20:51.38,00:20:51.38,">> It feels really, really good, like every muscle in my entire"
320,00:20:55.92,00:20:55.92,"body is loose and relaxed. I've not been that relaxed in,"
321,00:21:04.08,00:21:04.08,"you know, over a month. And it was icing on the cake."
322,00:21:06.96,00:21:06.96,"That was awesome, huh? >> This was, like, the best day"
323,00:21:10.12,00:21:10.12,ever. It was just such an amazing
324,00:21:12.92,00:21:12.92,"experience to be in the waterfall, and to have the food,"
325,00:21:16.29,00:21:16.29,and to have the massage. >> I'm so relaxed I can't even
326,00:21:19.54,00:21:19.54,get my shoes on my feet. >> Mm-hmm.
327,00:21:21.54,00:21:21.54,"That reward was just like, I can make it, for the rest of this"
328,00:21:24.38,00:21:24.38,game. We can do this.
329,00:21:36.12,00:21:36.12,>> Aren't you thirsty? >> Yeah.
330,00:21:37.71,00:21:37.71,>> This makes me thirsty. >> I'm always thirsty.
331,00:21:39.79,00:21:39.79,">> Lydia, can you bring that pitcher over?"
332,00:21:42.25,00:21:42.25,>> Yeah. >> Are you done with that cup?
333,00:21:44.38,00:21:44.38,">> Yeah, clean cup, too. >> Thank you."
334,00:21:47.50,00:21:47.50,>> Mm-hmm. >> Hi!
335,00:21:50.83,00:21:50.83,">> Hi, guys! How was the feast?"
336,00:21:54.08,00:21:54.08,>> It was like a plate of shishkabobs.
337,00:21:56.42,00:21:56.42,"It wasn't a ton of food. Like, we just ate quickly and"
338,00:21:59.21,00:21:59.21,"then, like, went down and kind of showered off in the"
339,00:22:01.46,00:22:01.46,waterfall. We came back to camp after the
340,00:22:03.04,00:22:03.04,"reward challenge, and I was like, ""Uh-oh, who's going to"
341,00:22:05.21,00:22:05.21,"make us feel comfortable about what happened?"""
342,00:22:08.04,00:22:08.04,">> Tell us from the beginning, like, when you got there."
343,00:22:10.08,00:22:10.08,">> As soon as you got there, with the platter waiting for"
344,00:22:12.12,00:22:12.12,you. >> There was shrimp and
345,00:22:13.42,00:22:13.42,"vegetables, and then steak and vegetables."
346,00:22:15.04,00:22:15.04,>> The shrimp was best. But it was really nice.
347,00:22:17.42,00:22:17.42,"It definitely was relaxing. >> Good, I'm so glad you guys"
348,00:22:21.29,00:22:21.29,got to do that. >> Cindy and Rafe came back to
349,00:22:23.42,00:22:23.42,camp and they shared the experience with everybody.
350,00:22:27.21,00:22:27.21,"I had to listen to them, you know, about how good the food"
351,00:22:30.04,00:22:30.04,"was and the shishkabob, and the mojitos, and what have you."
352,00:22:35.17,00:22:35.17,I felt insulted. Cindy should have chosen me to
353,00:22:38.08,00:22:38.08,go to this food reward. I'm an outcast.
354,00:22:41.08,00:22:41.08,That's what I feel like. >> Oh.
355,00:22:46.83,00:22:46.83,">> Try it? >> No, no, I've had enough food"
356,00:22:48.58,00:22:48.58,"today. >> Okay, okay."
357,00:22:50.04,00:22:50.04,">> Is it good, though? Did you put coffee in it?"
358,00:22:52.25,00:22:52.25,">> No just water, salt, and the leftovers that nobody wanted."
359,00:22:54.88,00:22:54.88,>> Oh. >> I didn't want to throw it
360,00:22:56.88,00:22:56.88,"away. >> Lydia had, like, some kind of"
361,00:22:59.00,00:22:59.00,corn soup or something in a little coffee cup eating it
362,00:23:02.33,00:23:02.33,"like, you know, she was just literally dying and she was"
363,00:23:05.88,00:23:05.88,scrounging for whatever she could find to eat.
364,00:23:08.88,00:23:08.88,"And it's almost like, you know, we're supposed to feel sorry for"
365,00:23:11.08,00:23:11.08,"you, and let you win something. But, I mean, we're here to"
366,00:23:15.04,00:23:15.04,"compete, and we're talking final four, and you've got to step it"
367,00:23:18.21,00:23:18.21,"up, or you're not going to be around."
368,00:23:21.12,00:23:21.12,">> We need to stick together, us four."
369,00:23:22.71,00:23:22.71,">> I think so, too. >> Because she's nice and"
370,00:23:27.25,00:23:27.25,smiles. >> This next couple of days are

391,00:25:05.96,00:25:05.96,Rafe and see what plan of action we can take.
392,00:25:11.38,00:25:11.38,"Hopefully, it'll work out. Otherwise, I've got to look at"

401,00:25:52.54,00:25:52.54,series of seven stations. You'll find a puzzle.
402,00:25:56.00,00:25:56.00,Put the puzzle together to reveal a question about the
403,00:25:59.12,00:25:59.12,story. Read it and choose between one

408,00:26:14.46,00:26:14.46,"You must grab your stick, throw it in the fire before you can go"
409,00:26:17.96,00:26:17.96,back to that station or any other station.

411,00:26:22.92,00:26:22.92,starting platform wins immunity. You ready for the story?
412,00:26:26.96,00:26:26.96,One of the most popular figures in Mayan mythology is the moon
413,00:26:31.50,00:26:31.50,"goddess, Ixchel. She was also the inventor of"
414,00:26:34.08,00:26:34.08,weaving. Ixchel was married to Itzamna.
415,00:26:36.29,00:26:36.29,He was the creator of the entire Maya culture.
416,00:26:40.29,00:26:40.29,"Together, they had four sons. They were responsible for"
417,00:26:42.46,00:26:42.46,"holding up the four corners of the sky, but that marriage"
418,00:26:45.96,00:26:45.96,"ended, Ixchel married again. This time she married the earth"
419,00:26:48.08,00:26:48.08,"god, Voltan. Voltan was a human hero, who had"
420,00:26:51.17,00:26:51.17,"been turned into a god. But after a short while, Ixchel"
421,00:26:54.54,00:26:54.54,grew tired of that and began having an affair with the sun
422,00:26:57.12,00:26:57.12,god. This frustrated her grandfather.
423,00:27:01.88,00:27:01.88,"He threw lightning down on her, killing her."
424,00:27:04.25,00:27:04.25,But dragonflies sang over her body.
425,00:27:07.08,00:27:07.08,"She came back to life, went right back to the affair she was"
426,00:27:08.96,00:27:08.96,"having with the sun. This lasted just a few days, and"
427,00:27:12.08,00:27:12.08,"she began having another affair with the sun's brother, the"
428,00:27:15.17,00:27:15.17,morning star. This devastated the sun god.
429,00:27:18.50,00:27:18.50,He banished her from his sight forever.
430,00:27:21.25,00:27:21.25,"Today, Ixchel spends her nights alone in the sky, nursing the"
431,00:27:24.25,00:27:24.25,women of earth through their pregnancy.
432,00:27:26.96,00:27:26.96,"As for the sun, when the sun is in sight, the moon stays hidden."
433,00:27:30.38,00:27:30.38,"That's the story. We'll draw for spots, and we'll"
434,00:27:32.79,00:27:32.79,"get started. Here we go, guys."
435,00:27:37.46,00:27:37.46,For immunity. Survivors ready?

559,00:36:42.12,00:36:42.12,">> Well, everybody looks up to Stephenie."
560,00:36:44.96,00:36:44.96,"She's played the game before, so in my eyes, it seems as if Steph"
561,00:36:49.54,00:36:49.54,"is running the show. >> PROBST: Steph, that is really"
562,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,just driving you bonkers listening to that.
563,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,>> I'm definitely not running the show.
564,00:36:58.50,00:36:58.50,Did I say I wanted it to stop when I we came back?
565,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"You're damn right. I said, ""Listen, if you got"
566,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,"something to say, say it to my face."
567,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,"""If not, I don't want to hear it anymore."""
568,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,That's all I said. So if that's running the show...
569,00:37:09.92,00:37:09.92,">> PROBST: Gary, what's your take on this?"
570,00:37:12.29,00:37:12.29,">> I personally like Steph, but there's some people here that"
571,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,"are star-struck by her. That's not her fault, but they"
572,00:37:18.75,00:37:18.75,all can probably get her autograph after the show.
573,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"( laughter ) >> PROBST: Cindy, are you happy"
574,00:37:26.21,00:37:26.21,with how you've played the game? Ethically.
575,00:37:28.75,00:37:28.75,"No compromises. I'm good. >> Yep, mm-hmm."
576,00:37:31.79,00:37:31.79,">> PROBST: Judd, happy with how you played?"
577,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,>> Absolutely. Definitely. >> PROBST: But in terms of
578,00:37:37.92,00:37:37.92,ethics-- whether or not to lie-- did you come into this with any
579,00:37:40.75,00:37:40.75,"sort of moral compass, or is it, ""Hey, it's Survivor, are you"
580,00:37:43.96,00:37:43.96,"nuts?"" >> To be honest with you, I"
581,00:37:45.79,00:37:45.79,"don't think I've lied yet, but I think I'm going to start lying,"
582,00:37:47.75,00:37:47.75,though. Everybody here is lying about
583,00:37:49.71,00:37:49.71,"everything. I mean, for the last past couple"
584,00:37:52.12,00:37:52.12,"of days, there's been lies, man, over here, over there, up there,"
585,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,over here. That's basically what's going
586,00:37:57.38,00:37:57.38,"on, man. I mean, everybody is sitting"
587,00:37:59.54,00:37:59.54,"here like things are fine and dandy, but that ain't the case,"
588,00:38:01.58,00:38:01.58,"man, seriously. So if I want to stick around in"
589,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,"this game, I'd better start lying."
590,00:38:06.21,00:38:06.21,"And you know what? I'm a damn bad liar, so I might"
591,00:38:08.21,00:38:08.21,"be in trouble, man. >> PROBST: You said there were"
592,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,lies all over the place. What are you referring to?
593,00:38:12.21,00:38:12.21,">> When we went on that reward, it was me, Danni, Gary, and"
594,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,"Steph. Gary came flat out and said,"
595,00:38:19.38,00:38:19.38,"""Cindy and Lydia should not even be here. "
596,00:38:22.71,00:38:22.71,"""They were riding coattail the whole damn way, and they have"
597,00:38:24.96,00:38:24.96,"no damn reason to even be in this game."""
598,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,That came right out of his mouth.
599,00:38:29.04,00:38:29.04,">> That's right, and so what did I lie about?"
600,00:38:30.79,00:38:30.79,>> Because then you're trying to make an alliance with Lydia.
601,00:38:33.21,00:38:33.21,>> But I didn't say... >> You wanted her out of the
602,00:38:35.54,00:38:35.54,game. >> But did I tell them that they
603,00:38:37.79,00:38:37.79,should be out of the game? I didn't tell them that.
604,00:38:39.62,00:38:39.62,">> You told me that. >> I know, but that's not a lie."
605,00:38:41.50,00:38:41.50,">> Oh, that's a lie. >> That's playing the game."
606,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,"How is that a lie? >> I know, that's playing the"
607,00:38:44.96,00:38:44.96,game. >> But that's not a lie.
608,00:38:46.96,00:38:46.96,I didn't lie to them. This is a lie.
609,00:38:48.83,00:38:48.83,"""Hey, you guys the idol is on the ground."""
610,00:38:51.00,00:38:51.00,That's a lie. >> Okay.
611,00:38:53.00,00:38:53.00,">> PROBST: Gary, what's the comment you're talking about the"
612,00:38:55.12,00:38:55.12,idol is on the ground? >> Way back when he got the clue
613,00:38:58.12,00:38:58.12,"about the idol, he goes, ""Okay, I'll tell you, it's on the"
614,00:39:01.62,00:39:01.62,"ground."" Well, I followed him out in the"
615,00:39:03.38,00:39:03.38,"woods the next day, and he is looking at all the trees."
616,00:39:05.79,00:39:05.79,"So I said, ""Hmm, that's strange. He told me it was on the"
617,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,"ground."" So I made myself seen in the"
618,00:39:10.04,00:39:10.04,"woods, and all of a sudden, he starts throwing rocks around,"
619,00:39:11.96,00:39:11.96,"and the idol was in the tree. >> PROBST: Okay, Judd, you got"
620,00:39:15.21,00:39:15.21,caught. You got outed tonight for lying.
621,00:39:17.62,00:39:17.62,">> Okay, all right, I lied about the damn idol."
622,00:39:20.17,00:39:20.17,Okay. I told you I'm a bad liar.
623,00:39:25.79,00:39:25.79,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time to vote."
624,00:39:27.79,00:39:27.79,"Rafe, you have the immunity necklace."
625,00:39:29.33,00:39:29.33,I can't imagine you are giving it up.
626,00:39:31.08,00:39:31.08,>> I want to keep it. >> PROBST: Rafe is the only one
627,00:39:33.17,00:39:33.17,you cannot vote for. Everybody else is fair game.
628,00:39:35.83,00:39:35.83,"It's time to vote. Lydia, you're up."
629,00:39:47.00,00:39:47.00,">> Gary, you've been running around the jungle for two days,"
630,00:39:49.96,00:39:49.96,"man, like a squirrel trying to get a damn nut, man."
631,00:39:52.92,00:39:52.92,Do me a favor and get the hell out of here.
632,00:40:11.42,00:40:11.42,>> PROBST: I'll go tally the votes.
633,00:40:24.00,00:40:24.00,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
634,00:40:26.54,00:40:26.54,Person voted out will be asked to leave the Tribal Council area
635,00:40:28.92,00:40:28.92,immediately. I'll read the votes.
636,00:40:32.79,00:40:32.79,"First vote, Gary. Cindy."
637,00:40:39.08,00:40:39.08,"One vote Gary, one vote Cindy. Gary."
638,00:40:44.75,00:40:44.75,"Two votes Gary, one vote Cindy. Gary."
639,00:40:49.83,00:40:49.83,That's three votes Gary. 12th person voted out
640,00:40:56.25,00:40:56.25,"of Survivor: Guatemala, Gary. That's four, it's enough."
641,00:40:58.83,00:40:58.83,"You need to bring me your torch. Gary, the tribe has spoken."
642,00:41:12.96,00:41:12.96,"Time for you to go. Well, one thing is becoming"
643,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,"clear to me from these Tribal Councils, and that is nobody is"
644,00:41:26.50,00:41:26.50,going down without a fight. Which means over the next nine
645,00:41:29.75,00:41:29.75,"days, there should be some big battles."
646,00:41:33.29,00:41:33.29,"Grab your torches, head back to camp."
647,00:41:35.75,00:41:35.75,Good night. >> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
648,00:41:49.92,00:41:49.92,from our next episode. >> PROBST: Next time on
649,00:41:54.79,00:41:54.79,"Survivor, Danni feels the pressure."
650,00:41:58.04,00:41:58.04,>> This perfect little alliance is going to have to start
651,00:41:59.42,00:41:59.42,breaking up. I'm definitely not going to go
652,00:42:01.88,00:42:01.88,down without a fight. >> PROBST: Lydia makes a move.
653,00:42:04.29,00:42:04.29,>> How far do you want to get to the final two?
654,00:42:06.08,00:42:06.08,>> Just as far as you do. >> We have seven freakin' days
655,00:42:07.67,00:42:07.67,left. Maybe it's time we make a
656,00:42:09.38,00:42:09.38,difference. >> PROBST: And the tribe is
657,00:42:11.21,00:42:11.21,shocked. >> This is so random!
658,00:42:19.38,00:42:19.38,>> What a great time. I had fun. It was great competition.
659,00:42:22.17,00:42:22.17,Loved meeting the people. My tribe does not know my real
660,00:42:25.42,00:42:25.42,"name, which is Gary Hogeboom. I didn't feel that it would be"
661,00:42:29.00,00:42:29.00,an advantage if they knew that I used to play in the NFL.
662,00:42:32.21,00:42:32.21,"So that was the lie I told, but I told it because I wanted to be"
663,00:42:35.08,00:42:35.08,"judged on how I played the game, not on who I was in the past."
