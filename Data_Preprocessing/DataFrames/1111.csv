557,00:36:39.75,00:36:39.75,>> PROBST: Who is running thecamp right now?
558,00:36:42.12,00:36:42.12,">> Well, everybody looks up toStephenie."
559,00:36:44.96,00:36:44.96,"She's played the game before, soin my eyes, it seems as if Steph"
560,00:36:49.54,00:36:49.54,"is running the show.>> PROBST: Steph, that is really"
561,00:36:53.17,00:36:53.17,just driving you bonkerslistening to that.
562,00:36:56.21,00:36:56.21,>> I'm definitely not runningthe show.
563,00:36:58.50,00:36:58.50,Did I say I wanted it to stopwhen I we came back?
564,00:37:00.21,00:37:00.21,"You're damn right.I said, ""Listen, if you got"
565,00:37:02.38,00:37:02.38,"something to say, say it to myface."
566,00:37:04.00,00:37:04.00,"""If not, I don't want to hear itanymore."""
567,00:37:05.79,00:37:05.79,That's all I said.So if that's running the show...
568,00:37:09.92,00:37:09.92,">> PROBST: Gary, what's yourtake on this?"
569,00:37:12.29,00:37:12.29,">> I personally like Steph, butthere's some people here that"
570,00:37:15.75,00:37:15.75,"are star-struck by her.That's not her fault, but they"
571,00:37:18.75,00:37:18.75,all can probably get herautograph after the show.
572,00:37:21.83,00:37:21.83,"( laughter )>> PROBST: Cindy, are you happy"
573,00:37:26.21,00:37:26.21,with how you've played the game?Ethically.
574,00:37:28.75,00:37:28.75,"No compromises. I'm good.>> Yep, mm-hmm."
575,00:37:31.79,00:37:31.79,">> PROBST: Judd, happy with howyou played?"
576,00:37:34.12,00:37:34.12,>> Absolutely. Definitely.>> PROBST: But in terms of
577,00:37:37.92,00:37:37.92,ethics-- whether or not to lie--did you come into this with any
578,00:37:40.75,00:37:40.75,"sort of moral compass, or is it,""Hey, it's Survivor, are you"
579,00:37:43.96,00:37:43.96,"nuts?"">> To be honest with you, I"
580,00:37:45.79,00:37:45.79,"don't think I've lied yet, but Ithink I'm going to start lying,"
581,00:37:47.75,00:37:47.75,though.Everybody here is lying about
582,00:37:49.71,00:37:49.71,"everything.I mean, for the last past couple"
583,00:37:52.12,00:37:52.12,"of days, there's been lies, man,over here, over there, up there,"
584,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,over here.That's basically what's going
585,00:37:57.38,00:37:57.38,"on, man.I mean, everybody is sitting"
586,00:37:59.54,00:37:59.54,"here like things are fine anddandy, but that ain't the case,"
587,00:38:01.58,00:38:01.58,"man, seriously.So if I want to stick around in"
588,00:38:03.83,00:38:03.83,"this game, I'd better startlying."
589,00:38:06.21,00:38:06.21,"And you know what?I'm a damn bad liar, so I might"
590,00:38:08.21,00:38:08.21,"be in trouble, man.>> PROBST: You said there were"
591,00:38:10.17,00:38:10.17,lies all over the place.What are you referring to?
592,00:38:12.21,00:38:12.21,">> When we went on that reward,it was me, Danni, Gary, and"
593,00:38:16.42,00:38:16.42,"Steph.Gary came flat out and said,"
594,00:38:19.38,00:38:19.38,"""Cindy and Lydia should not evenbe here. "
595,00:38:22.71,00:38:22.71,"""They were riding coattail thewhole damn way, and they have"
596,00:38:24.96,00:38:24.96,"no damn reason to even be inthis game."""
597,00:38:27.12,00:38:27.12,That came right out of hismouth.
598,00:38:29.04,00:38:29.04,">> That's right, and so what didI lie about?"
599,00:38:30.79,00:38:30.79,>> Because then you're trying tomake an alliance with Lydia.
600,00:38:33.21,00:38:33.21,>> But I didn't say...>> You wanted her out of the
601,00:38:35.54,00:38:35.54,game.>> But did I tell them that they
602,00:38:37.79,00:38:37.79,should be out of the game?I didn't tell them that.
603,00:38:39.62,00:38:39.62,">> You told me that.>> I know, but that's not a lie."
604,00:38:41.50,00:38:41.50,">> Oh, that's a lie.>> That's playing the game."
605,00:38:43.33,00:38:43.33,"How is that a lie?>> I know, that's playing the"
606,00:38:44.96,00:38:44.96,game.>> But that's not a lie.
607,00:38:46.96,00:38:46.96,I didn't lie to them.This is a lie.
608,00:38:48.83,00:38:48.83,"""Hey, you guys the idol is onthe ground."""
609,00:38:51.00,00:38:51.00,That's a lie.>> Okay.
610,00:38:53.00,00:38:53.00,">> PROBST: Gary, what's thecomment you're talking about the"
611,00:38:55.12,00:38:55.12,idol is on the ground?>> Way back when he got the clue
612,00:38:58.12,00:38:58.12,"about the idol, he goes, ""Okay,I'll tell you, it's on the"
613,00:39:01.62,00:39:01.62,"ground.""Well, I followed him out in the"
614,00:39:03.38,00:39:03.38,"woods the next day, and he islooking at all the trees."
615,00:39:05.79,00:39:05.79,"So I said, ""Hmm, that's strange.He told me it was on the"
616,00:39:08.08,00:39:08.08,"ground.""So I made myself seen in the"
617,00:39:10.04,00:39:10.04,"woods, and all of a sudden, hestarts throwing rocks around,"
618,00:39:11.96,00:39:11.96,"and the idol was in the tree.>> PROBST: Okay, Judd, you got"
619,00:39:15.21,00:39:15.21,caught.You got outed tonight for lying.
620,00:39:17.62,00:39:17.62,">> Okay, all right, I lied aboutthe damn idol."
621,00:39:20.17,00:39:20.17,Okay.I told you I'm a bad liar.
622,00:39:25.79,00:39:25.79,">> PROBST: Okay, it is time tovote."
623,00:39:27.79,00:39:27.79,"Rafe, you have the immunitynecklace."
624,00:39:29.33,00:39:29.33,I can't imagine you are givingit up.
625,00:39:31.08,00:39:31.08,>> I want to keep it.>> PROBST: Rafe is the only one
626,00:39:33.17,00:39:33.17,you cannot vote for.Everybody else is fair game.
627,00:39:35.83,00:39:35.83,"It's time to vote.Lydia, you're up."
628,00:39:47.00,00:39:47.00,">> Gary, you've been runningaround the jungle for two days,"
629,00:39:49.96,00:39:49.96,"man, like a squirrel trying toget a damn nut, man."
630,00:39:52.92,00:39:52.92,Do me a favor and get the hellout of here.
631,00:40:11.42,00:40:11.42,>> PROBST: I'll go tally thevotes.
632,00:40:24.00,00:40:24.00,"Once the votes are read, thedecision is final."
633,00:40:26.54,00:40:26.54,Person voted out will be askedto leave the Tribal Council area
634,00:40:28.92,00:40:28.92,immediately.I'll read the votes.
635,00:40:32.79,00:40:32.79,"First vote, Gary.Cindy."
636,00:40:39.08,00:40:39.08,"One vote Gary, one vote Cindy.Gary."
637,00:40:44.75,00:40:44.75,"Two votes Gary, one vote Cindy.Gary."
638,00:40:49.83,00:40:49.83,That's three votes Gary.12th person voted out
639,00:40:56.25,00:40:56.25,"of Survivor: Guatemala, Gary.That's four, it's enough."
640,00:40:58.83,00:40:58.83,"You need to bring me your torch.Gary, the tribe has spoken."
641,00:41:12.96,00:41:12.96,"Time for you to go.Well, one thing is becoming"
642,00:41:24.17,00:41:24.17,"clear to me from these TribalCouncils, and that is nobody is"
643,00:41:26.50,00:41:26.50,going down without a fight.Which means over the next nine
644,00:41:29.75,00:41:29.75,"days, there should be some bigbattles."
645,00:41:33.29,00:41:33.29,"Grab your torches, head back tocamp."
646,00:41:35.75,00:41:35.75,Good night.>> PROBST: Stay tuned for scenes
647,00:41:49.92,00:41:49.92,from our next episode.>> PROBST: Next time on
648,00:41:54.79,00:41:54.79,"Survivor, Danni feels thepressure."
649,00:41:58.04,00:41:58.04,>> This perfect little allianceis going to have to start
650,00:41:59.42,00:41:59.42,breaking up.I'm definitely not going to go
651,00:42:01.88,00:42:01.88,down without a fight.>> PROBST: Lydia makes a move.
652,00:42:04.29,00:42:04.29,>> How far do you want to get tothe final two?
653,00:42:06.08,00:42:06.08,>> Just as far as you do.>> We have seven freakin' days
654,00:42:07.67,00:42:07.67,left.Maybe it's time we make a
655,00:42:09.38,00:42:09.38,difference.>> PROBST: And the tribe is
656,00:42:11.21,00:42:11.21,shocked.>> This is so random!
657,00:42:19.38,00:42:19.38,>> What a great time. I had fun.It was great competition.
658,00:42:22.17,00:42:22.17,Loved meeting the people.My tribe does not know my real
659,00:42:25.42,00:42:25.42,"name, which is Gary Hogeboom.I didn't feel that it would be"
660,00:42:29.00,00:42:29.00,an advantage if they knew that Iused to play in the NFL.
661,00:42:32.21,00:42:32.21,"So that was the lie I told, butI told it because I wanted to be"
662,00:42:35.08,00:42:35.08,"judged on how I played the game,not on who I was in the past."
