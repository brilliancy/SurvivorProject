1,00:00:01.60,00:00:01.60,JEFF PROBST: Previously on Survivor...
2,00:00:03.20,00:00:03.20, 16 strangers were marooned on Taratao Island
3,00:00:06.70,00:00:06.70, in exotic Thailand.
4,00:00:08.43,00:00:08.43," The two oldest survivors, Jan and Jake,"
5,00:00:11.23,00:00:11.23, were allowed to choose their own tribes.
6,00:00:13.23,00:00:13.23,"JAN: When Jeff said that we were picking the tribes,"
7,00:00:15.67,00:00:15.67,I really did kind of get scared.
8,00:00:17.43,00:00:17.43,"PROBST: Jan chose an older group for her tribe, Chuay Gahn,"
9,00:00:19.97,00:00:19.97, while Jake went with youth and brawn for Sook Jai.
10,00:00:23.23,00:00:23.23,JAKE: I based picking a team on athleticism
11,00:00:25.70,00:00:25.70, and just that gleam in their eye.
12,00:00:27.23,00:00:27.23,PROBST: The Chuay Gahn tribe found
13,00:00:28.87,00:00:28.87, a ready-made shelter on their beach.
14,00:00:30.50,00:00:30.50,We got a natural caveand everything.
15,00:00:32.37,00:00:32.37,PROBST: But their water hole was far from camp
16,00:00:34.93,00:00:34.93, -and difficult to find. -There's no way that we're
17,00:00:36.80,00:00:36.80,supposed to be able tocome up here every couple days
18,00:00:38.67,00:00:38.67,with a big huge gallon jug.
19,00:00:40.23,00:00:40.23,PROBST: The Sook Jai tribe found their water hole nearby.
20,00:00:43.23,00:00:43.23,Yeah!
21,00:00:44.57,00:00:44.57,PROBST: But the tribe butted heads
22,00:00:45.70,00:00:45.70, over their shelter.
23,00:00:47.03,00:00:47.03,ROBB: So many people are going so many directions
24,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,and they're notproducing anything.
25,00:00:49.67,00:00:49.67,"PROBST: Back at Chuay Gahn,"
26,00:00:51.27,00:00:51.27, Tanya was feeling sick.
27,00:00:52.60,00:00:52.60,I don't think I drankenough water yesterday.
28,00:00:55.23,00:00:55.23,Go!
29,00:00:56.43,00:00:56.43," At the first immunity challenge,"
30,00:00:57.77,00:00:57.77, the older Chuay Gahn tribe surprised everyone
31,00:00:59.43,00:00:59.43, by taking an early lead.
32,00:01:01.20,00:01:01.20, But Ghandia gave it away
33,00:01:02.97,00:01:02.97, when she struggled with the sliding puzzle.
34,00:01:04.83,00:01:04.83,Hurry up! Hurry up!
35,00:01:06.03,00:01:06.03,Sook Jai wins immunity!
36,00:01:08.60,00:01:08.60," Chuay Gahn went to Tribal Council, where Pastor John"
37,00:01:11.50,00:01:11.50, was the first person voted out of the tribe.
38,00:01:14.10,00:01:14.10,The tribe has spoken.
39,00:01:16.17,00:01:16.17, 15 are left.
40,00:01:17.53,00:01:17.53, Who will be the next to go?
41,00:02:36.80,00:02:36.80,(snoring)
42,00:02:47.37,00:02:47.37,(snoring continues)
43,00:02:54.63,00:02:54.63,(snickering)
44,00:02:55.87,00:02:55.87,What?
45,00:02:56.97,00:02:56.97,(laughing)
46,00:02:59.47,00:02:59.47,You're snoring.
47,00:03:04.07,00:03:04.07,"Oh, Lord, with all that snoring,I didn't get no sleep."
48,00:03:06.80,00:03:06.80,"HELEN: As a tribe, you do sleep in"
49,00:03:08.60,00:03:08.60," very close quarters, and it's hard."
50,00:03:11.80,00:03:11.80," Clay snores. I don't know how a guy that's only, like,"
51,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,five-five has that much soundcoming out of his body.
52,00:03:17.33,00:03:17.33," But out here, quite frankly,"
53,00:03:19.27,00:03:19.27," by the time everybody hits the sack,"
54,00:03:21.07,00:03:21.07,we're exhausted.
55,00:03:23.00,00:03:23.00,Ready to roll?
56,00:03:24.30,00:03:24.30,Let's rock and roll.
57,00:03:25.53,00:03:25.53,"One, two, three."
58,00:03:30.33,00:03:30.33,(groaning):Oh.
59,00:03:32.03,00:03:32.03,We're almost there.
60,00:03:33.03,00:03:33.03,(groaning):Oh.
61,00:03:34.47,00:03:34.47,GHANDIA: The boat that we have is a piece of crap.
62,00:03:37.43,00:03:37.43," It fills with sand, it fills with water,"
63,00:03:39.40,00:03:39.40,"we have to tip it over,it's extremely heavy."
64,00:03:41.73,00:03:41.73," With our water source being as far away as it is,"
65,00:03:45.53,00:03:45.53, it just makes the journey to go get water
66,00:03:47.57,00:03:47.57,even more frustrating.
67,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,CLAY: Helen and Jan didn't take the map with them;
68,00:03:56.47,00:03:56.47, they thought they could figure it out.
69,00:03:58.40,00:03:58.40, And that's one of Helen's deals.
70,00:03:59.90,00:03:59.90," ""I know where it is,I know how to do it. Let's go."""
71,00:04:01.70,00:04:01.70, When she doesn't.
72,00:04:02.70,00:04:02.70,That's the first thing we asked.
73,00:04:03.73,00:04:03.73,"Well, didn't they take the map?"
74,00:04:04.90,00:04:04.90,We turn aroundand there's the map.
75,00:04:14.30,00:04:14.30,"-Okay, you're going.-Yep."
76,00:04:15.83,00:04:15.83,Take the strap.
77,00:04:17.27,00:04:17.27,"Okay, when you come back,I'll go."
78,00:04:18.93,00:04:18.93,All right.
79,00:04:20.33,00:04:20.33,Gives me a little rest.
80,00:04:42.73,00:04:42.73,(sighs)
81,00:04:44.77,00:04:44.77,"I don't thinkthis is right, Jan."
82,00:04:48.40,00:04:48.40,HELEN: We went beyond the right cove into
83,00:04:51.30,00:04:51.30, the absolute wrong cove.
84,00:04:52.93,00:04:52.93," That was, like,"
85,00:04:54.23,00:04:54.23,"huge, huge mistake."
86,00:04:56.83,00:04:56.83, It looked like it was honeycombed with snake holes.
87,00:05:00.63,00:05:00.63, And Jan
88,00:05:02.00,00:05:02.00,nicely volunteeredto stay with the boat
89,00:05:03.70,00:05:03.70,on all the explorations.
90,00:05:05.20,00:05:05.20,Think maybe it wasthat first alcove we went into?
91,00:05:11.13,00:05:11.13,Yeah.
92,00:05:21.80,00:05:21.80,TED: This is a--
93,00:05:23.63,00:05:23.63,That's par threeor par four right here?
94,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97,Where's the hole?Right there?
95,00:05:26.97,00:05:26.97,"Oh, it's got to be a par three."
96,00:05:28.43,00:05:28.43,This is a par three?
97,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"-There's the tee box.-Okay, cool."
98,00:05:31.03,00:05:31.03,Ooh! Ooh!
99,00:05:33.53,00:05:33.53,"CLAY: My luxury item is a golf club,"
100,00:05:35.63,00:05:35.63,and we have set up three holes.
101,00:05:37.17,00:05:37.17,"We got a par five,"
102,00:05:38.50,00:05:38.50, we got a par three and a par six.
103,00:05:40.40,00:05:40.40,-Look out for the water!-There's the water hole!
104,00:05:42.90,00:05:42.90,(laughter)
105,00:05:44.77,00:05:44.77,CLAY: And we're in top competition.
106,00:05:46.43,00:05:46.43," They're both ahead of me two shots,"
107,00:05:48.30,00:05:48.30,and I'm the one that broughtthe luxury item here.
108,00:05:50.33,00:05:50.33,Here goes Clay...
109,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57,"Ooh, nice-- Oh!"
110,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,-Oh!-(laughter)
111,00:05:57.53,00:05:57.53,"Oh, baby!"
112,00:05:59.83,00:05:59.83,(laughter)
113,00:06:10.63,00:06:10.63,"HELEN: Stupidly, we kept going in the wrong direction."
114,00:06:14.13,00:06:14.13, We got into a wicked bad current.
115,00:06:16.20,00:06:16.20," And Jan's a nice lady and strong swimmer,"
116,00:06:18.80,00:06:18.80, but she's not as strong as I am upper body.
117,00:06:21.10,00:06:21.10,"So I'm, like, compensatingin the back, and she just--"
118,00:06:23.73,00:06:23.73, She's older than I am.
119,00:06:25.13,00:06:25.13, She definitely-- you can look at her--
120,00:06:26.53,00:06:26.53, she doesn't have as much upper body strength.
121,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50, So I can't get mad at that; that's just a physical fact.
122,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,"This looks like the beach more,"
123,00:06:34.50,00:06:34.50,the one that we swam to.
124,00:06:36.30,00:06:36.30,"HELEN: It was a nightmare. At one point,"
125,00:06:38.30,00:06:38.30, I was about ready-- if I had a pistol
126,00:06:39.77,00:06:39.77," in my pocket, I would have pulled it out,"
127,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,"shot her first, shot me second."
128,00:06:44.37,00:06:44.37,That's why I don't carry a gun.
129,00:06:54.77,00:06:54.77,"JAKE: The number one priority has been,"
130,00:06:56.43,00:06:56.43," for four days out here,"
131,00:06:57.73,00:06:57.73,to get usa really nice shelter built.
132,00:07:01.70,00:07:01.70," It's really important because,"
133,00:07:02.93,00:07:02.93," I mean, we're in the monsoon season."
134,00:07:05.10,00:07:05.10,Do you want to guaranteebeing dry?
135,00:07:07.13,00:07:07.13,"When the rain comes,the water hits this,"
136,00:07:10.10,00:07:10.10,it pours it down into the gutter
137,00:07:11.87,00:07:11.87,and the gutter justpours it right off.
138,00:07:13.47,00:07:13.47,"All right, well,let's get cracking."
139,00:07:16.80,00:07:16.80,JAKE: The shelter has become almost
140,00:07:19.10,00:07:19.10, an obsession to the tribe.
141,00:07:21.03,00:07:21.03," But Stephanie and Jed have not worked on the hut very much,"
142,00:07:24.17,00:07:24.17, which has caused problems with
143,00:07:25.53,00:07:25.53,the people who've beenworking on the hut.
144,00:07:28.80,00:07:28.80,It'd be greatif somebody out there
145,00:07:29.90,00:07:29.90,could collect some moreof this rope.
146,00:07:31.93,00:07:31.93,Jed ain't doing anything.
147,00:07:32.93,00:07:32.93,You think he cares?
148,00:07:35.27,00:07:35.27,(chuckles)
149,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,"Well, no,I know he doesn't care,"
150,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,but that's not the point.
151,00:07:39.37,00:07:39.37,"KEN: If I was in his place, I would want to try"
152,00:07:41.90,00:07:41.90," to help as much as possible,"
153,00:07:43.13,00:07:43.13, knowing that I stood out so much.
154,00:07:44.43,00:07:44.43," It's one thing to be lazy, but to be"
155,00:07:47.50,00:07:47.50,freakin' lazy is another thing.
156,00:07:49.27,00:07:49.27,"You know, you're putting itin everybody's face"
157,00:07:50.80,00:07:50.80,that you're not going to doa damn thing.
158,00:07:52.53,00:07:52.53,What do you want to do today?
159,00:07:54.53,00:07:54.53,"-Build the fort?-I mean, I know"
160,00:07:56.23,00:07:56.23,"shelter's important, but I justcan't get into that right now."
161,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97,JED: Spending your energy building a shelter
162,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97, seems kind of frivolous to me.
163,00:08:04.50,00:08:04.50,"I mean, it's the fourth dayand it's not even done."
164,00:08:08.53,00:08:08.53,STEPHANIE: Maybe I'm looking at it all wrong.
165,00:08:10.67,00:08:10.67, Maybe they're looking at it right.
166,00:08:11.77,00:08:11.77,(chuckles)
167,00:08:13.10,00:08:13.10,Maybe we really don't needthe food and water.
168,00:08:16.20,00:08:16.20, I just don't think that theyunderstand what they have to do
169,00:08:19.30,00:08:19.30, to survive in a situation like this.
170,00:08:21.40,00:08:21.40," 'Cause right now, Jed'spretty much taking care of food"
171,00:08:24.53,00:08:24.53, and I've been primarily the water.
172,00:08:26.20,00:08:26.20," So if he took the two of us out of the equation,"
173,00:08:29.33,00:08:29.33,I'm not surehow the other six would do.
174,00:08:31.93,00:08:31.93,"Drink up, man."
175,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,"I want you to be healthy, okay?"
176,00:08:34.80,00:08:34.80,ROBB: Jed didn't necessarily
177,00:08:35.87,00:08:35.87," help us at all with the shelter,"
178,00:08:37.33,00:08:37.33," which I was kind of upset about, but he's done"
179,00:08:38.97,00:08:38.97, a lot of work. There's gonna be
180,00:08:40.20,00:08:40.20, little things that are gonna upset me.
181,00:08:41.23,00:08:41.23," And I can't let them all just,"
182,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60," you know, really get to me."
183,00:08:44.00,00:08:44.00,"'Cause I got a while out here,and I want to remain"
184,00:08:45.93,00:08:45.93,pretty good friendswith everybody.
185,00:08:53.97,00:08:53.97,BRIAN: It's little surprising that they're not back yet
186,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,with the water.
187,00:08:56.87,00:08:56.87,Think they're all right?
188,00:08:57.87,00:08:57.87,"I'm hoping they would be,"
189,00:08:59.20,00:08:59.20,"'cause the best I can figure,it'd take you"
190,00:09:01.13,00:09:01.13,"an hour to row there to get it,and then start paddling back."
191,00:09:04.37,00:09:04.37,Three hours at the most.
192,00:09:05.43,00:09:05.43,But we would be-- we should be
193,00:09:06.67,00:09:06.67,"seeing them,and we haven't seen nothing."
194,00:09:17.60,00:09:17.60,Helen?
195,00:09:19.03,00:09:19.03,Are you coming?
196,00:09:23.67,00:09:23.67,"I got it, Jan!"
197,00:09:25.83,00:09:25.83,(sighs)
198,00:09:26.83,00:09:26.83,Thank God.
199,00:09:28.93,00:09:28.93,I won't have to slap youin the face this time.
200,00:09:30.83,00:09:30.83,HELEN: Thank God.
201,00:09:31.93,00:09:31.93, I finally found the water source.
202,00:09:35.13,00:09:35.13," We were here the other day, but it's like what they say"
203,00:09:38.03,00:09:38.03,about being lost in the desert:
204,00:09:39.63,00:09:39.63, it all looks the same after a while.
205,00:09:41.53,00:09:41.53,"We way overshotour destination,"

210,00:09:53.23,00:09:53.23,I'm about ready to pass out.
211,00:10:22.03,00:10:22.03,Hey!
212,00:10:23.10,00:10:23.10,Where you going?We live right here!

214,00:10:27.93,00:10:27.93,All right.
215,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,Stay right there;we'll bring you.
216,00:10:31.07,00:10:31.07,CLAY: It took them four or five hours before we could even
217,00:10:34.30,00:10:34.30, see them coming aroundthe tip of the rock over there.
218,00:10:36.43,00:10:36.43,"It was real, real hard on them."
219,00:10:37.97,00:10:37.97,They were real worn outwhen they got home.
220,00:10:40.10,00:10:40.10,"Oh, my bottom."
221,00:10:42.63,00:10:42.63,My bottom.
222,00:10:43.80,00:10:43.80,Look at the boat.
223,00:10:44.93,00:10:44.93,We bailed itthree times since that.
224,00:10:47.00,00:10:47.00,Look at it.
225,00:10:48.30,00:10:48.30,CLAY: You need to be careful out here.
226,00:10:49.97,00:10:49.97,"I mean, every corneryou go around, you got sand,"
227,00:10:52.03,00:10:52.03,"you got pretty trees,you got pretty everything."
228,00:10:54.50,00:10:54.50, I bet she doesn't take off again like that.
229,00:10:56.40,00:10:56.40, I think she's a little worn out.
230,00:10:57.80,00:10:57.80,"She acted like she wasn't,but she could hardly walk."
231,00:11:01.27,00:11:01.27,JAN: Can this tribe not doany more adventures for a while?

236,00:11:14.90,00:11:14.90,JAKE: I think our shelter is far enough along
237,00:11:17.67,00:11:17.67, that we don't have to worry about it anymore.
238,00:11:20.33,00:11:20.33, But now
239,00:11:21.47,00:11:21.47,we need food a whole lot worse.
240,00:11:23.57,00:11:23.57,Look at this.
241,00:11:24.97,00:11:24.97,"They're all dead, though."

244,00:11:29.70,00:11:29.70,and looked for shellfish.
245,00:11:31.63,00:11:31.63,You want to make a number ofhow many crabs they bring back?
246,00:11:34.80,00:11:34.80,Probably one.

248,00:11:38.17,00:11:38.17,JED: They're going to go gather food.
249,00:11:40.57,00:11:40.57, You go one guy or two guys.
250,00:11:42.30,00:11:42.30, You don't need
251,00:11:43.60,00:11:43.60,five people to go to one spot
252,00:11:45.67,00:11:45.67,"that's as big as,you know, a kitchen."
253,00:11:47.97,00:11:47.97,See that one right there?
254,00:11:50.07,00:11:50.07,Just went back in.

260,00:12:02.00,00:12:02.00,"ERIN: We actually found quite a few oysters,"
261,00:12:04.17,00:12:04.17,which there's a ton there.
262,00:12:05.47,00:12:05.47,It just takes a really long timeto crack them off.
263,00:12:09.60,00:12:09.60,SHII ANN: It was great.
264,00:12:10.77,00:12:10.77, It's really rewarding
265,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,"to work as a team, and everyone"

271,00:12:25.13,00:12:25.13,it was so much fun to catch it.
272,00:12:26.63,00:12:26.63," I was hoping, anyway, that everyone would be so happy."
273,00:12:29.13,00:12:29.13, There'd be water boiling and we'd just
274,00:12:31.07,00:12:31.07," throw it in and we'd eat the shellfish or whatever, but..."
275,00:12:34.97,00:12:34.97,wasn't like that.
276,00:12:36.43,00:12:36.43,It was kind of strange.
277,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,"-Jed, you want anything?-No."
278,00:12:47.97,00:12:47.97,"Robb, you want anything?"
279,00:12:49.13,00:12:49.13,Stephanie?

282,00:12:56.40,00:12:56.40, But Stephanie and Robb and Jed didn't want to eat any of it.
283,00:13:01.73,00:13:01.73, There's so few happy moments here.
284,00:13:04.73,00:13:04.73," We're fighting against nature,"
285,00:13:06.17,00:13:06.17, we're fighting against each other.
286,00:13:07.73,00:13:07.73,"We all want to have a good time,"
287,00:13:09.37,00:13:09.37,"but before the good times, wehave to work together as a team."
288,00:13:15.13,00:13:15.13,"Good night, everybody."
289,00:13:17.03,00:13:17.03,Good night.
290,00:13:18.67,00:13:18.67,JED: I can't sleep
291,00:13:20.93,00:13:20.93, in that little fort that everyone's building.
292,00:13:23.00,00:13:23.00,You can't get sleepin that thing.
293,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50, So me and Steph and Robb slept on the sand.
294,00:13:27.93,00:13:27.93,"I think it's going to bea nice clear night, dude."

309,00:14:47.67,00:14:47.67, Jed snubbed the shelter
310,00:14:50.03,00:14:50.03, and then came to sleep under the shelter.
311,00:14:52.50,00:14:52.50,JED: I just slept like a baby.
312,00:14:54.33,00:14:54.33, Probably got about two drops the whole night.
313,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07, I don't really worry if it's okay with anybody.
314,00:14:59.60,00:14:59.60,If I'm going to get that water

321,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67, chose to stay in that hard rain.
322,00:15:23.60,00:15:23.60, She said that the coals were warm.
323,00:15:26.03,00:15:26.03, She's also told me
324,00:15:27.80,00:15:27.80,that she absolutelyloves the rain.
325,00:15:30.07,00:15:30.07,So...

328,00:15:36.10,00:15:36.10," all night sleeping in the torrential rain, and it seemed"
329,00:15:38.53,00:15:38.53, like she was being pig-headed.

622,00:26:06.67,00:26:06.67, a tough time right now
623,00:26:07.83,00:26:07.83, adjusting to the survival element.
624,00:26:09.20,00:26:09.20,We're trying to slowlynurse her back to health.
625,00:26:11.03,00:26:11.03,"She needs a lot of rest,she needs some water"
626,00:26:12.67,00:26:12.67,and a little bit of food--she hasn't eaten much.
627,00:26:14.53,00:26:14.53,So I'm a little concernedabout her health.
628,00:26:16.20,00:26:16.20,"Ever since I threw upon that seafood,"
629,00:26:18.03,00:26:18.03,"it's making my stomach, like..."
630,00:26:19.33,00:26:19.33,"I know, she can't."
631,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,TANYA:It associates it.
632,00:26:45.60,00:26:45.60,(flies buzzing)
633,00:26:46.70,00:26:46.70,CLAY:Dang!
634,00:26:48.80,00:26:48.80,"Look at them,they're all over the beach!"
635,00:26:51.90,00:26:51.90,My God.
636,00:26:53.57,00:26:53.57,"Hey, y'all come check outthe squid on the beach!"
637,00:26:56.10,00:26:56.10,"Well, look at themall up through here."
638,00:26:58.37,00:26:58.37,Look at there.
639,00:26:59.83,00:26:59.83,Isn't that squid?
640,00:27:01.80,00:27:01.80,You think they're edible?
641,00:27:02.80,00:27:02.80,"Yeah, but only if they're dead."
642,00:27:03.87,00:27:03.87,-If we cook them?-Smell that thing.
643,00:27:05.80,00:27:05.80,"Huh. I know, I smell it."
644,00:27:07.53,00:27:07.53,"That could be breakfast, guys,just right here."
645,00:27:09.27,00:27:09.27,I say let's go aheadand try some.
646,00:27:10.50,00:27:10.50,At least the tentacles;these are safe right here.
647,00:27:12.63,00:27:12.63,-The tentacles are safe?-Yeah.
648,00:27:14.03,00:27:14.03,"HELEN: This morning, we found squid on the beach,"
649,00:27:17.30,00:27:17.30," and, um, I have, once in my life, bought squid"
650,00:27:19.73,00:27:19.73," that wasn't cleaned,"
651,00:27:21.87,00:27:21.87,so I knew how to do it.
652,00:27:23.17,00:27:23.17,"Dude, we want to try and take"
653,00:27:24.63,00:27:24.63,"that skin off, too.See how we're getting these?"

658,00:27:34.57,00:27:34.57,"I mean, there's no play to her."
659,00:27:36.20,00:27:36.20, She's supposed to be some kind of marine expert.
660,00:27:38.20,00:27:38.20, She's kind of got thepersonality of an encyclopedia.
661,00:27:40.03,00:27:40.03," You open it up,"
662,00:27:41.73,00:27:41.73,there ain't nothing in therefun to read.
663,00:27:43.30,00:27:43.30,You only open itwhen you need information.
664,00:27:45.20,00:27:45.20,This does not cook long at all.
665,00:27:48.50,00:27:48.50,A minute or two?
666,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,"No, I'm telling you,it cooks quickly."
667,00:27:51.70,00:27:51.70,-But the longerthe better or...? -No.
668,00:27:53.50,00:27:53.50,"Hell, I think that's got toget cooked a little bit."
669,00:27:56.43,00:27:56.43,"It might get more cooked,but it's going to be rubber."
670,00:27:58.77,00:27:58.77,HELEN: I know how to cook squid.
671,00:28:01.00,00:28:01.00,I don't care if we don't like itright now
672,00:28:02.33,00:28:02.33,the taste isn't that good.
673,00:28:03.87,00:28:03.87,"We've got to have food if we'regoing to compete, you know."
674,00:28:10.97,00:28:10.97,-We got tree mail.-Y'all ready?
675,00:28:12.50,00:28:12.50,Got tree mail. What does it say?
676,00:28:14.03,00:28:14.03,"It says, ""Petals on the ocean"

681,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10,Sounds to me like kind of awater deal and a swimming deal.
682,00:28:35.90,00:28:35.90,"STEPHANIE: I'm going to be a little worried about me,"
683,00:28:38.43,00:28:38.43,just because I'm still honestly not feeling very well.
684,00:28:41.53,00:28:41.53,I have to be able to dosomething to show the tribe
685,00:28:44.53,00:28:44.53,"that, you know,I'm still in this."

694,00:29:11.43,00:29:11.43,Those pieces have been tethered

826,00:35:49.93,00:35:49.93, I think we're all trying to keep each other's spirits up.
827,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10,"I mean, now we know nobody's--somebody's going home tonight."
828,00:35:56.10,00:35:56.10,"You know, that's never good."
829,00:35:58.90,00:35:58.90,I want to votefor Helen before Jan.
830,00:36:01.40,00:36:01.40,No.
831,00:36:02.40,00:36:02.40,"She's getting on my nerves, yo."
832,00:36:03.80,00:36:03.80,But strength-wise...
833,00:36:05.23,00:36:05.23,That's the only reason.
834,00:36:07.17,00:36:07.17,"I mean, everything isa big deal."
835,00:36:09.33,00:36:09.33,Yeah.
836,00:36:10.70,00:36:10.70,"""I am going to go over hereand I am going to pick up"
837,00:36:13.03,00:36:13.03,"this one leafand I'm going to bring it back."""
838,00:36:15.03,00:36:15.03,(laughter)
839,00:36:16.30,00:36:16.30,GHANDIA: I'm not really sure
840,00:36:17.70,00:36:17.70, who I'm voting for tonight; it's a tossup.
841,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50, There's somebody who I want to vote for because
842,00:36:22.90,00:36:22.90,"she's getting on my nerves,which is Helen."
843,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17, And then there's somebodywho I don't necessarily want to
844,00:36:28.13,00:36:28.13," vote for, but I think she's ready to go, which is Tanya."
845,00:36:31.93,00:36:31.93,HELEN: This is going to be a terribly hard vote for me.
846,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,Everybody loves Tanya.
847,00:36:36.77,00:36:36.77,We all love Tanya.
848,00:36:38.07,00:36:38.07, That may play in her favor.
849,00:36:39.47,00:36:39.47, So I think it's one of those nights
850,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,where it could be anybody.
851,00:37:01.13,00:37:01.13,"Well, it's never funcoming to Tribal Council,"
852,00:37:03.67,00:37:03.67,but two times in a row.
853,00:37:05.93,00:37:05.93,"Ted, how is the moralein this tribe?"
854,00:37:08.20,00:37:08.20,"Um, I think the moraleis slowly declining."
855,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,"However, we're stillin high spirits."
856,00:37:13.53,00:37:13.53,And we're still a family.
857,00:37:15.43,00:37:15.43,"Ghandia, is what Ted said true?"
858,00:37:16.50,00:37:16.50,Is the moraledeclining a little?
859,00:37:18.00,00:37:18.00,I think it might bedeclining just a little bit
860,00:37:20.30,00:37:20.30,because our losses are so close
861,00:37:22.90,00:37:22.90,that I think that makes usa little sad.
862,00:37:24.73,00:37:24.73,"But, um, we justkeep believing that"
863,00:37:27.43,00:37:27.43,when we do winthat it'll be a big win.
864,00:37:30.77,00:37:30.77,"They think we're a wash,and I think they've got"
865,00:37:32.77,00:37:32.77,some days comingwhere they're going to see
866,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,a whole lot of you hereinstead of us.
867,00:37:37.93,00:37:37.93,"Tanya, did you have any ideait would be this tough"
868,00:37:40.40,00:37:40.40,only six days in?
869,00:37:41.73,00:37:41.73,"No, I had no ideait would be this tough."
870,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,Been camping beforelots of times
871,00:37:46.60,00:37:46.60,and just didn't thinkit would be this hard.
872,00:37:48.63,00:37:48.63,PROBST:Who here will admit
873,00:37:49.93,00:37:49.93,"that at least one pointin these first six days,"
874,00:37:52.47,00:37:52.47,you have to assess how you'refitting in with everyone else?
875,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,That is the object of this game.
876,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73,You don't knowany of these people.
877,00:37:58.67,00:37:58.67,"Helen, you're starting to nod."
878,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,"Oh, yeah, I mean,you'd have to be crazy"
879,00:38:02.47,00:38:02.47,if you didn't think that way.
880,00:38:04.10,00:38:04.10,"I-I wonder every day,like, gee, you know,"
881,00:38:06.40,00:38:06.40,I wonder if they like me.
882,00:38:07.50,00:38:07.50,I wonder if I saidthe right thing.
883,00:38:09.10,00:38:09.10,Do they find metoo in control all the time?
884,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,"I mean, they threw me"
885,00:38:12.73,00:38:12.73,"this wonderful anniversary partythe other night,"
886,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,"and I'll tell you, it wasall I could keep from doing"
887,00:38:19.17,00:38:19.17,to not run into the back of thecave and just absolutely cry.
888,00:38:22.57,00:38:22.57,"I really triedto hold it together,"
889,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,but it was one ofthe nicest things anybody's ever
890,00:38:27.00,00:38:27.00,"done for me, so I was really...I was touched."
891,00:38:29.40,00:38:29.40,Sounds like a beautiful moment.
892,00:38:32.33,00:38:32.33,"Oh, don't even-- don't start."
893,00:38:33.97,00:38:33.97,'Cause I'm under ordersnot to cry.
894,00:38:36.00,00:38:36.00,Why are youunder orders not to cry?
895,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,"'Cause I work withall these men, they're, like,"
896,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,"Green Berets and SEALs,"
897,00:38:42.20,00:38:42.20,"and they go,""Okay, you can't cry."""
898,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,"I am totally un--no, I'm not ki--"
899,00:38:46.07,00:38:46.07,"I can't go back there if I do,because they'll give me"
900,00:38:48.93,00:38:48.93,"such a rationfor the next year, I-- no."
901,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,"Ghandia, what are youbasing your vote on tonight?"
902,00:38:55.67,00:38:55.67,I'm basing my vote on...
903,00:38:59.87,00:38:59.87,the person's abilityto actually mesh
904,00:39:03.57,00:39:03.57,with the rest of us.
905,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,I think that's really important.
906,00:39:07.13,00:39:07.13,There has to be a goodcamaraderie amongst all of us.
907,00:39:11.10,00:39:11.10,"Jan, how toughwill tonight's vote be?"
908,00:39:13.70,00:39:13.70,It will be hard.
909,00:39:15.53,00:39:15.53,"It's not oneI want to make, but, um,"
910,00:39:18.30,00:39:18.30,it needs to be for the betterof the entire group.
911,00:39:23.57,00:39:23.57,It is time to vote.
912,00:39:25.87,00:39:25.87,"Tanya, you're first."
913,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,"Like an older brother wouldto a younger sister,"
914,00:39:53.80,00:39:53.80,"got to take care of you,"
915,00:39:54.93,00:39:54.93,got to make sure you geta full meal tonight.
916,00:39:57.33,00:39:57.33,"So, Tanya, need youto get better, okay? Enjoy."
917,00:39:59.50,00:39:59.50,Talk to you soon.
918,00:40:20.23,00:40:20.23,I don't feel comfortablewith how you try
919,00:40:21.93,00:40:21.93,to keep your emotions in check.
920,00:40:24.33,00:40:24.33,"And also, I just don't think"
921,00:40:26.67,00:40:26.67,that you effectivelyhandle stress.
922,00:40:29.43,00:40:29.43,Seems like you kind ofget too anxious
923,00:40:31.60,00:40:31.60,"and just startbugging out, frankly."
924,00:40:33.93,00:40:33.93,"I think, in the long run,that's going to hurt the group."
925,00:40:55.60,00:40:55.60,I'll go tally the votes.
926,00:41:03.47,00:41:03.47,"Once the votes are read,the decision is final."
927,00:41:05.37,00:41:05.37,The person voted out will be
928,00:41:06.70,00:41:06.70,asked to leave theTribal Council area immediately.
929,00:41:08.80,00:41:08.80,I'll read the votes.
930,00:41:13.47,00:41:13.47,First vote.
931,00:41:15.43,00:41:15.43,Tanya.
932,00:41:19.33,00:41:19.33,Helen.
933,00:41:25.53,00:41:25.53,"Two votes Helen, one vote Tanya."
934,00:41:32.40,00:41:32.40,Tanya.
935,00:41:33.40,00:41:33.40,Tennessee.
936,00:41:34.70,00:41:34.70,"Two votes Tanya,two votes Helen."
937,00:41:41.83,00:41:41.83,Tennessee.
938,00:41:43.33,00:41:43.33,"Three votes Tanya,two votes Helen."
939,00:41:50.57,00:41:50.57,Tanya. That's four.
940,00:41:52.53,00:41:52.53,That's enough.You need to bring me your torch.
941,00:42:04.97,00:42:04.97,"Tanya, the tribe has spoken."
942,00:42:09.80,00:42:09.80,"Love you, Tanya."
943,00:42:23.97,00:42:23.97,"You guys seem like a good,strong, likable tribe."
944,00:42:27.63,00:42:27.63,The only way to start winningis to keep that togetherness.
945,00:42:30.67,00:42:30.67,"Head back to camp,get some sleep."
946,00:42:47.77,00:42:47.77, Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

949,00:42:59.03,00:42:59.03,(grunting)
950,00:43:00.77,00:43:00.77,"No, no, no! Foul!"
951,00:43:02.33,00:43:02.33, Will Chuay Gahn make a comeback?
952,00:43:03.70,00:43:03.70,Yeah!

955,00:43:08.30,00:43:08.30, through the Chuay Gahn camp.
956,00:43:09.23,00:43:09.23,I didn't deny ...
957,00:43:10.97,00:43:10.97,(screaming)
958,00:43:18.70,00:43:18.70,"Chuay Gahn, this has beenthe opportunity of a lifetime."
959,00:43:22.40,00:43:22.40,"It's been a great experience,and it does change your life."
960,00:43:26.07,00:43:26.07,I learned that I take thingsat home for granted.
961,00:43:28.93,00:43:28.93,And I'm not madat any of you for picking me.
962,00:43:31.97,00:43:31.97,"And I just loveevery one of you,"
