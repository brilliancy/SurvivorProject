1,00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00,
2,00:00:01.60,00:00:01.60,JEFF PROBST:  Previously on Survivor...
3,00:00:03.20,00:00:03.20, 16 strangers were marooned  on Taratao Island
4,00:00:06.70,00:00:06.70, in exotic Thailand.
5,00:00:08.43,00:00:08.43," The two oldest survivors,  Jan and Jake,"
6,00:00:11.23,00:00:11.23, were allowed to choose  their own tribes.
7,00:00:13.23,00:00:13.23,"JAN: When Jeff said that  we were picking the tribes,"
8,00:00:15.67,00:00:15.67,I really did kind of get scared.
9,00:00:17.43,00:00:17.43,"PROBST: Jan chose an older group  for her tribe, Chuay Gahn,"
10,00:00:19.97,00:00:19.97, while Jake went with  youth and brawn for Sook Jai.
11,00:00:23.23,00:00:23.23,JAKE: I based picking a team  on athleticism
12,00:00:25.70,00:00:25.70, and just that gleam  in their eye.
13,00:00:27.23,00:00:27.23,PROBST:  The Chuay Gahn tribe found
14,00:00:28.87,00:00:28.87, a ready-made shelter  on their beach.
15,00:00:30.50,00:00:30.50,We got a natural cave and everything.
16,00:00:32.37,00:00:32.37,PROBST: But their water hole  was far from camp
17,00:00:34.93,00:00:34.93, -and difficult to find.  -There's no way that we're
18,00:00:36.80,00:00:36.80,supposed to be able to come up here every couple days
19,00:00:38.67,00:00:38.67,with a big huge gallon jug.
20,00:00:40.23,00:00:40.23,PROBST: The Sook Jai tribe  found their water hole nearby.
21,00:00:43.23,00:00:43.23,Yeah!
22,00:00:44.57,00:00:44.57,PROBST:  But the tribe butted heads
23,00:00:45.70,00:00:45.70, over their shelter.
24,00:00:47.03,00:00:47.03,ROBB: So many people are  going so many directions
25,00:00:48.60,00:00:48.60,and they're not producing anything.
26,00:00:49.67,00:00:49.67,"PROBST:  Back at Chuay Gahn,"
27,00:00:51.27,00:00:51.27, Tanya was feeling sick.
28,00:00:52.60,00:00:52.60,I don't think I drank enough water yesterday.
29,00:00:55.23,00:00:55.23,Go!
30,00:00:56.43,00:00:56.43," At the first  immunity challenge,"
31,00:00:57.77,00:00:57.77, the older Chuay Gahn tribe  surprised everyone
32,00:00:59.43,00:00:59.43, by taking an early lead.
33,00:01:01.20,00:01:01.20, But Ghandia gave it away
34,00:01:02.97,00:01:02.97, when she struggled  with the sliding puzzle.
35,00:01:04.83,00:01:04.83,Hurry up! Hurry up!
36,00:01:06.03,00:01:06.03,Sook Jai wins immunity!
37,00:01:08.60,00:01:08.60," Chuay Gahn went to Tribal  Council, where Pastor John"
38,00:01:11.50,00:01:11.50, was the first person  voted out of the tribe.
39,00:01:14.10,00:01:14.10,The tribe has spoken.
40,00:01:16.17,00:01:16.17, 15 are left.
41,00:01:17.53,00:01:17.53, Who will be the next to go?
42,00:02:36.80,00:02:36.80,(snoring)
43,00:02:47.37,00:02:47.37,(snoring continues)
44,00:02:54.63,00:02:54.63,(snickering)
45,00:02:55.87,00:02:55.87,What?
46,00:02:56.97,00:02:56.97,(laughing)
47,00:02:59.47,00:02:59.47,You're snoring.
48,00:03:04.07,00:03:04.07,"Oh, Lord, with all that snoring, I didn't get no sleep."
49,00:03:06.80,00:03:06.80,"HELEN: As a tribe,  you do sleep in"
50,00:03:08.60,00:03:08.60," very close quarters,  and it's hard."
51,00:03:11.80,00:03:11.80," Clay snores. I don't know  how a guy that's only, like,"
52,00:03:14.40,00:03:14.40,five-five has that much sound coming out of his body.
53,00:03:17.33,00:03:17.33," But out here, quite frankly,"
54,00:03:19.27,00:03:19.27," by the time  everybody hits the sack,"
55,00:03:21.07,00:03:21.07,we're exhausted.
56,00:03:23.00,00:03:23.00,Ready to roll?
57,00:03:24.30,00:03:24.30,Let's rock and roll.
58,00:03:25.53,00:03:25.53,"One, two, three."
59,00:03:30.33,00:03:30.33,(groaning): Oh.
60,00:03:32.03,00:03:32.03,We're almost there.
61,00:03:33.03,00:03:33.03,(groaning): Oh.
62,00:03:34.47,00:03:34.47,GHANDIA: The boat that we have  is a piece of crap.
63,00:03:37.43,00:03:37.43," It fills with sand,  it fills with water,"
64,00:03:39.40,00:03:39.40,"we have to tip it over, it's extremely heavy."
65,00:03:41.73,00:03:41.73," With our water source  being as far away as it is,"
66,00:03:45.53,00:03:45.53, it just makes the journey  to go get water
67,00:03:47.57,00:03:47.57,even more frustrating.
68,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,CLAY: Helen and Jan  didn't take the map with them;
69,00:03:56.47,00:03:56.47, they thought  they could figure it out.
70,00:03:58.40,00:03:58.40, And that's one of  Helen's deals.
71,00:03:59.90,00:03:59.90," ""I know where it is, I know how to do it. Let's go."""
72,00:04:01.70,00:04:01.70, When she doesn't.
73,00:04:02.70,00:04:02.70,That's the first thing we asked.
74,00:04:03.73,00:04:03.73,"Well, didn't they take the map?"
75,00:04:04.90,00:04:04.90,We turn around and there's the map.
76,00:04:14.30,00:04:14.30,"-Okay, you're going. -Yep."
77,00:04:15.83,00:04:15.83,Take the strap.
78,00:04:17.27,00:04:17.27,"Okay, when you come back, I'll go."
79,00:04:18.93,00:04:18.93,All right.
80,00:04:20.33,00:04:20.33,Gives me a little rest.
81,00:04:42.73,00:04:42.73,(sighs)
82,00:04:44.77,00:04:44.77,"I don't think this is right, Jan."
83,00:04:48.40,00:04:48.40,HELEN: We went beyond  the right cove into
84,00:04:51.30,00:04:51.30, the absolute wrong cove.
85,00:04:52.93,00:04:52.93," That was, like,"
86,00:04:54.23,00:04:54.23,"huge, huge mistake."
87,00:04:56.83,00:04:56.83, It looked like it was  honeycombed with snake holes.
88,00:05:00.63,00:05:00.63, And Jan
89,00:05:02.00,00:05:02.00,nicely volunteered to stay with the boat
90,00:05:03.70,00:05:03.70,on all the explorations.
91,00:05:05.20,00:05:05.20,Think maybe it was that first alcove we went into?
92,00:05:11.13,00:05:11.13,Yeah.
93,00:05:21.80,00:05:21.80,TED:  This is a--
94,00:05:23.63,00:05:23.63,That's par three or par four right here?
95,00:05:25.97,00:05:25.97,Where's the hole? Right there?
96,00:05:26.97,00:05:26.97,"Oh, it's got to be a par three."
97,00:05:28.43,00:05:28.43,This is a par three?
98,00:05:29.53,00:05:29.53,"-There's the tee box. -Okay, cool."
99,00:05:31.03,00:05:31.03,Ooh! Ooh!
100,00:05:33.53,00:05:33.53,"CLAY:  My luxury item is a golf club,"
101,00:05:35.63,00:05:35.63,and we have set up three holes.
102,00:05:37.17,00:05:37.17,"We got a par five,"
103,00:05:38.50,00:05:38.50, we got a par three  and a par six.
104,00:05:40.40,00:05:40.40,-Look out for the water! -There's the water hole!
105,00:05:42.90,00:05:42.90,(laughter)
106,00:05:44.77,00:05:44.77,CLAY:  And we're in top competition.
107,00:05:46.43,00:05:46.43," They're both ahead of me  two shots,"
108,00:05:48.30,00:05:48.30,and I'm the one that brought the luxury item here.
109,00:05:50.33,00:05:50.33,Here goes Clay...
110,00:05:53.57,00:05:53.57,"Ooh, nice-- Oh!"
111,00:05:55.43,00:05:55.43,-Oh! -(laughter)
112,00:05:57.53,00:05:57.53,"Oh, baby!"
113,00:05:59.83,00:05:59.83,(laughter)
114,00:06:10.63,00:06:10.63,"HELEN: Stupidly, we kept going  in the wrong direction."
115,00:06:14.13,00:06:14.13, We got into  a wicked bad current.
116,00:06:16.20,00:06:16.20," And Jan's a nice lady  and strong swimmer,"
117,00:06:18.80,00:06:18.80, but she's not as strong  as I am upper body.
118,00:06:21.10,00:06:21.10,"So I'm, like, compensating in the back, and she just--"
119,00:06:23.73,00:06:23.73, She's older than I am.
120,00:06:25.13,00:06:25.13, She definitely--  you can look at her--
121,00:06:26.53,00:06:26.53, she doesn't have as much  upper body strength.
122,00:06:28.50,00:06:28.50, So I can't get mad at that;  that's just a physical fact.
123,00:06:31.80,00:06:31.80,"This looks like the beach more,"
124,00:06:34.50,00:06:34.50,the one that we swam to.
125,00:06:36.30,00:06:36.30,"HELEN: It was a nightmare.  At one point,"
126,00:06:38.30,00:06:38.30, I was about ready--  if I had a pistol
127,00:06:39.77,00:06:39.77," in my pocket,  I would have pulled it out,"
128,00:06:41.17,00:06:41.17,"shot her first, shot me second."
129,00:06:44.37,00:06:44.37,That's why I don't carry a gun.
130,00:06:54.77,00:06:54.77,"JAKE: The number one priority  has been,"
131,00:06:56.43,00:06:56.43," for four days out here,"
132,00:06:57.73,00:06:57.73,to get us a really nice shelter built.
133,00:07:01.70,00:07:01.70," It's really important because,"
134,00:07:02.93,00:07:02.93," I mean,  we're in the monsoon season."
135,00:07:05.10,00:07:05.10,Do you want to guarantee being dry?
136,00:07:07.13,00:07:07.13,"When the rain comes, the water hits this,"
137,00:07:10.10,00:07:10.10,it pours it down into the gutter
138,00:07:11.87,00:07:11.87,and the gutter just pours it right off.
139,00:07:13.47,00:07:13.47,"All right, well, let's get cracking."
140,00:07:16.80,00:07:16.80,JAKE:  The shelter has become almost
141,00:07:19.10,00:07:19.10, an obsession to the tribe.
142,00:07:21.03,00:07:21.03," But Stephanie and Jed have not  worked on the hut very much,"
143,00:07:24.17,00:07:24.17, which has caused problems with
144,00:07:25.53,00:07:25.53,the people who've been working on the hut.
145,00:07:28.80,00:07:28.80,It'd be great if somebody out there
146,00:07:29.90,00:07:29.90,could collect some more of this rope.
147,00:07:31.93,00:07:31.93,Jed ain't doing anything.
148,00:07:32.93,00:07:32.93,You think he cares?
149,00:07:35.27,00:07:35.27,(chuckles)
150,00:07:36.33,00:07:36.33,"Well, no, I know he doesn't care,"
151,00:07:37.83,00:07:37.83,but that's not the point.
152,00:07:39.37,00:07:39.37,"KEN: If I was in his place,  I would want to try"
153,00:07:41.90,00:07:41.90," to help as much as possible,"
154,00:07:43.13,00:07:43.13, knowing that I stood out  so much.
155,00:07:44.43,00:07:44.43," It's one thing to be lazy,  but to be"
156,00:07:47.50,00:07:47.50,freakin' lazy is another thing.
157,00:07:49.27,00:07:49.27,"You know, you're putting it in everybody's face"
158,00:07:50.80,00:07:50.80,that you're not going to do a damn thing.
159,00:07:52.53,00:07:52.53,What do you want to do today?
160,00:07:54.53,00:07:54.53,"-Build the fort? -I mean, I know"
161,00:07:56.23,00:07:56.23,"shelter's important, but I just can't get into that right now."
162,00:07:59.97,00:07:59.97,JED: Spending your energy  building a shelter
163,00:08:01.97,00:08:01.97, seems kind of frivolous to me.
164,00:08:04.50,00:08:04.50,"I mean, it's the fourth day and it's not even done."
165,00:08:08.53,00:08:08.53,STEPHANIE: Maybe I'm looking  at it all wrong.
166,00:08:10.67,00:08:10.67, Maybe they're  looking at it right.
167,00:08:11.77,00:08:11.77,(chuckles)
168,00:08:13.10,00:08:13.10,Maybe we really don't need the food and water.
169,00:08:16.20,00:08:16.20, I just don't think that they understand what they have to do
170,00:08:19.30,00:08:19.30, to survive  in a situation like this.
171,00:08:21.40,00:08:21.40," 'Cause right now, Jed's pretty much taking care of food"
172,00:08:24.53,00:08:24.53, and I've been  primarily the water.
173,00:08:26.20,00:08:26.20," So if he took the two of us  out of the equation,"
174,00:08:29.33,00:08:29.33,I'm not sure how the other six would do.
175,00:08:31.93,00:08:31.93,"Drink up, man."
176,00:08:33.17,00:08:33.17,"I want you to be healthy, okay?"
177,00:08:34.80,00:08:34.80,ROBB:  Jed didn't necessarily
178,00:08:35.87,00:08:35.87," help us at all  with the shelter,"
179,00:08:37.33,00:08:37.33," which I was kind of  upset about, but he's done"
180,00:08:38.97,00:08:38.97, a lot of work.  There's gonna be
181,00:08:40.20,00:08:40.20, little things  that are gonna upset me.
182,00:08:41.23,00:08:41.23," And I can't let them all just,"
183,00:08:42.60,00:08:42.60," you know, really get to me."
184,00:08:44.00,00:08:44.00,"'Cause I got a while out here, and I want to remain"
185,00:08:45.93,00:08:45.93,pretty good friends with everybody.
186,00:08:53.97,00:08:53.97,BRIAN: It's little surprising  that they're not back yet
187,00:08:55.83,00:08:55.83,with the water.
188,00:08:56.87,00:08:56.87,Think they're all right?
189,00:08:57.87,00:08:57.87,"I'm hoping they would be,"
190,00:08:59.20,00:08:59.20,"'cause the best I can figure, it'd take you"
191,00:09:01.13,00:09:01.13,"an hour to row there to get it, and then start paddling back."
192,00:09:04.37,00:09:04.37,Three hours at the most.
193,00:09:05.43,00:09:05.43,But we would be-- we should be
194,00:09:06.67,00:09:06.67,"seeing them, and we haven't seen nothing."
195,00:09:17.60,00:09:17.60,Helen?
196,00:09:19.03,00:09:19.03,Are you coming?
197,00:09:23.67,00:09:23.67,"I got it, Jan!"
198,00:09:25.83,00:09:25.83,(sighs)
199,00:09:26.83,00:09:26.83,Thank God.
200,00:09:28.93,00:09:28.93,I won't have to slap you in the face this time.
201,00:09:30.83,00:09:30.83,HELEN:  Thank God.
202,00:09:31.93,00:09:31.93, I finally found  the water source.
203,00:09:35.13,00:09:35.13," We were here the other day,  but it's like what they say"
204,00:09:38.03,00:09:38.03,about being lost in the desert:
205,00:09:39.63,00:09:39.63, it all looks  the same after a while.
206,00:09:41.53,00:09:41.53,"We way overshot our destination,"
207,00:09:43.60,00:09:43.60,"we tried every beach,"
208,00:09:46.40,00:09:46.40,"and I don't know, all of a sudden,"
209,00:09:47.90,00:09:47.90,"God just put it in my mind, I guess."
210,00:09:51.00,00:09:51.00,"But, boy, I'm telling you, I am so dehydrated,"
211,00:09:53.23,00:09:53.23,I'm about ready to pass out.
212,00:10:22.03,00:10:22.03,Hey!
213,00:10:23.10,00:10:23.10,Where you going? We live right here!
214,00:10:25.30,00:10:25.30,I know it; we can't get in with the current.
215,00:10:27.93,00:10:27.93,All right.
216,00:10:29.23,00:10:29.23,Stay right there; we'll bring you.
217,00:10:31.07,00:10:31.07,CLAY: It took them four or five  hours before we could even
218,00:10:34.30,00:10:34.30, see them coming around the tip of the rock over there.
219,00:10:36.43,00:10:36.43,"It was real, real hard on them."
220,00:10:37.97,00:10:37.97,They were real worn out when they got home.
221,00:10:40.10,00:10:40.10,"Oh, my bottom."
222,00:10:42.63,00:10:42.63,My bottom.
223,00:10:43.80,00:10:43.80,Look at the boat.
224,00:10:44.93,00:10:44.93,We bailed it three times since that.
225,00:10:47.00,00:10:47.00,Look at it.
226,00:10:48.30,00:10:48.30,CLAY: You need to be  careful out here.
227,00:10:49.97,00:10:49.97,"I mean, every corner you go around, you got sand,"
228,00:10:52.03,00:10:52.03,"you got pretty trees, you got pretty everything."
229,00:10:54.50,00:10:54.50, I bet she doesn't  take off again like that.
230,00:10:56.40,00:10:56.40, I think  she's a little worn out.
231,00:10:57.80,00:10:57.80,"She acted like she wasn't, but she could hardly walk."
232,00:11:01.27,00:11:01.27,JAN: Can this tribe not do any more adventures for a while?
233,00:11:04.57,00:11:04.57,(laughter)
234,00:11:06.87,00:11:06.87,They seem very painful.
235,00:11:08.77,00:11:08.77,(laughter)
236,00:11:09.77,00:11:09.77,No kidding.
237,00:11:14.90,00:11:14.90,JAKE: I think our shelter  is far enough along
238,00:11:17.67,00:11:17.67, that we don't have to worry  about it anymore.
239,00:11:20.33,00:11:20.33, But now
240,00:11:21.47,00:11:21.47,we need food a whole lot worse.
241,00:11:23.57,00:11:23.57,Look at this.
242,00:11:24.97,00:11:24.97,"They're all dead, though."
243,00:11:26.33,00:11:26.33,"ERIN:  So, we went down towards"
244,00:11:27.93,00:11:27.93,"the end of the beach, towards the cave,"
245,00:11:29.70,00:11:29.70,and looked for shellfish.
246,00:11:31.63,00:11:31.63,You want to make a number of how many crabs they bring back?
247,00:11:34.80,00:11:34.80,Probably one.
248,00:11:36.53,00:11:36.53,(laughs): One.
249,00:11:38.17,00:11:38.17,JED: They're going to go  gather food.
250,00:11:40.57,00:11:40.57, You go one guy or two guys.
251,00:11:42.30,00:11:42.30, You don't need
252,00:11:43.60,00:11:43.60,five people to go to one spot
253,00:11:45.67,00:11:45.67,"that's as big as, you know, a kitchen."
254,00:11:47.97,00:11:47.97,See that one right there?
255,00:11:50.07,00:11:50.07,Just went back in.
256,00:11:51.37,00:11:51.37,There he is.
257,00:11:53.30,00:11:53.30,Durn things are so fast.
258,00:11:55.83,00:11:55.83,-Here he comes. -There he is.
259,00:11:57.47,00:11:57.47,(laughs)
260,00:11:58.83,00:11:58.83,"-So we eat tonight, right? -Whoo!"
261,00:12:02.00,00:12:02.00,"ERIN: We actually found  quite a few oysters,"
262,00:12:04.17,00:12:04.17,which there's a ton there.
263,00:12:05.47,00:12:05.47,It just takes a really long time to crack them off.
264,00:12:09.60,00:12:09.60,SHII ANN:  It was great.
265,00:12:10.77,00:12:10.77, It's really rewarding
266,00:12:12.07,00:12:12.07,"to work as a team, and everyone"
267,00:12:13.77,00:12:13.77,"was having fun, really focused on one goal."
268,00:12:17.40,00:12:17.40,Word up.
269,00:12:18.40,00:12:18.40,Fruitful?
270,00:12:20.17,00:12:20.17,"Yeah, we got a bunch of snails, oysters."
271,00:12:23.03,00:12:23.03,SHII ANN: Coming back  with all that food--
272,00:12:25.13,00:12:25.13,it was so much fun to catch it.
273,00:12:26.63,00:12:26.63," I was hoping, anyway, that  everyone would be so happy."
274,00:12:29.13,00:12:29.13, There'd be water boiling  and we'd just
275,00:12:31.07,00:12:31.07," throw it in and we'd eat the  shellfish or whatever, but..."
276,00:12:34.97,00:12:34.97,wasn't like that.
277,00:12:36.43,00:12:36.43,It was kind of strange.
278,00:12:46.50,00:12:46.50,"-Jed, you want anything? -No."
279,00:12:47.97,00:12:47.97,"Robb, you want anything?"
280,00:12:49.13,00:12:49.13,Stephanie?
281,00:12:50.80,00:12:50.80,SHII ANN:  Food is one of the things
282,00:12:53.43,00:12:53.43, that humans share to show  affection for each other.
283,00:12:56.40,00:12:56.40, But Stephanie and Robb and Jed  didn't want to eat any of it.
284,00:13:01.73,00:13:01.73, There's so few  happy moments here.
285,00:13:04.73,00:13:04.73," We're fighting against nature,"
286,00:13:06.17,00:13:06.17, we're fighting  against each other.
287,00:13:07.73,00:13:07.73,"We all want to have a good time,"
288,00:13:09.37,00:13:09.37,"but before the good times, we have to work together as a team."
289,00:13:15.13,00:13:15.13,"Good night, everybody."
290,00:13:17.03,00:13:17.03,Good night.
291,00:13:18.67,00:13:18.67,JED:  I can't sleep
292,00:13:20.93,00:13:20.93, in that little fort  that everyone's building.
293,00:13:23.00,00:13:23.00,You can't get sleep in that thing.
294,00:13:24.50,00:13:24.50, So me and Steph and Robb  slept on the sand.
295,00:13:27.93,00:13:27.93,"I think it's going to be a nice clear night, dude."
296,00:13:38.03,00:13:38.03,(thunder rumbling)

299,00:14:23.47,00:14:23.47,"It looks like there's some thick clouds covering, dude."
300,00:14:27.33,00:14:27.33,"And that breeze is cold, dude, it cuts to the bone."
301,00:14:29.90,00:14:29.90,"SHII ANN: I am so glad  we had that shelter built,"
302,00:14:32.60,00:14:32.60, even though it didn't  keep all the rain out.
303,00:14:35.87,00:14:35.87,"Well, I mean, you look up and see"
304,00:14:37.00,00:14:37.00,those little holes in the roof.
305,00:14:38.17,00:14:38.17,Just one or two more layers and this thing
306,00:14:40.43,00:14:40.43,would have been dry as toast.
307,00:14:42.87,00:14:42.87,I sure would like some toast.
308,00:14:44.20,00:14:44.20,"(chuckles) Me, too."
309,00:14:45.27,00:14:45.27,SHII ANN:  It's interesting.
310,00:14:47.67,00:14:47.67, Jed snubbed the shelter
311,00:14:50.03,00:14:50.03, and then came to sleep  under the shelter.
312,00:14:52.50,00:14:52.50,JED:  I just slept like a baby.
313,00:14:54.33,00:14:54.33, Probably got about two drops  the whole night.
314,00:14:57.07,00:14:57.07, I don't really worry  if it's okay with anybody.
315,00:14:59.60,00:14:59.60,If I'm going to get that water
316,00:15:01.00,00:15:01.00,"when people are building shelter,"
317,00:15:02.83,00:15:02.83,then they need to realize I might sleep
318,00:15:04.83,00:15:04.83,underneath their shelter that they've been building.
319,00:15:07.03,00:15:07.03,How is Stephanie doing?
320,00:15:09.20,00:15:09.20,"-Have you seen her? -No, I haven't seen her."
321,00:15:18.50,00:15:18.50,JAKE: I have no earthly idea  why Stephanie
322,00:15:21.67,00:15:21.67, chose to stay  in that hard rain.
323,00:15:23.60,00:15:23.60, She said that  the coals were warm.
324,00:15:26.03,00:15:26.03, She's also told me
325,00:15:27.80,00:15:27.80,that she absolutely loves the rain.
326,00:15:30.07,00:15:30.07,So...
327,00:15:31.73,00:15:31.73,I think we're gonna start the roof.
328,00:15:34.37,00:15:34.37,KEN: I think it was  very weird that she spent
329,00:15:36.10,00:15:36.10," all night sleeping in the  torrential rain, and it seemed"
330,00:15:38.53,00:15:38.53, like she was being pig-headed.
331,00:15:39.77,00:15:39.77," And right now,"
332,00:15:41.73,00:15:41.73,she's sick.
333,00:15:46.00,00:15:46.00,SHII ANN:  It's not wise to be
334,00:15:47.43,00:15:47.43, out in the rain  when you have a cold.
335,00:15:49.37,00:15:49.37,Can't afford to have her be sick.
336,00:15:51.10,00:15:51.10,"We'll lose immunity and then the game will really, really begin."
337,00:16:06.30,00:16:06.30,"(quiet chatter, guitar playing gentle melody)"

357,00:16:49.30,00:16:49.30, up there in the tree--  wasn't 100 feet from us.
358,00:16:51.57,00:16:51.57,Just like he had come to sit in for a concert or something.
359,00:16:54.03,00:16:54.03,"Just that curious, I guess."

372,00:17:21.03,00:17:21.03,I'll celebrate when I get back.
373,00:17:25.70,00:17:25.70,I think it would really mean a lot to her
374,00:17:27.70,00:17:27.70,if we do do a little celebration.
375,00:17:29.10,00:17:29.10,Mm-hmm.
376,00:17:30.10,00:17:30.10,"'Cause, you know,"

383,00:17:47.87,00:17:47.87,Think this is going to make her cry.

385,00:17:51.90,00:17:51.90,You try it on.

409,00:18:49.43,00:18:49.43,So it's something you really want to win at this point.
410,00:18:52.10,00:18:52.10,I think would it be good to distract the other team
411,00:18:54.17,00:18:54.17,-with my cleavage. -(chuckles)
412,00:18:55.57,00:18:55.57,"And if need be, it's easy access, in case I have to"

414,00:19:00.13,00:19:00.13,They're going to be blindfolded.

428,00:19:34.47,00:19:34.47, led only by the guide's  verbal commands.
429,00:19:36.67,00:19:36.67, They'll be crossing each other's paths three times.
430,00:19:39.43,00:19:39.43, Along the way  are several stations
431,00:19:41.97,00:19:41.97,with bags in your tribe's colors hanging from each one.
432,00:19:44.50,00:19:44.50,"Untie all your colored bags, get back to your mat first."

444,00:20:12.07,00:20:12.07,sit out the same tribe member in back-to-back challenges.
445,00:20:13.83,00:20:13.83,-Who you going to sit out? -Stephanie.

595,00:25:15.70,00:25:15.70, I was getting  really nervous that maybe
596,00:25:19.17,00:25:19.17,they were going to vote me off.

606,00:25:37.30,00:25:37.30,And that's why it's hard to vote people off.
607,00:25:39.60,00:25:39.60,How you going to vote people off after they do that for you?
608,00:25:43.87,00:25:43.87,"How is it, everybody?"

616,00:25:56.30,00:25:56.30,Your stomach's still a little touchy.
617,00:25:57.97,00:25:57.97,Just throw down one clam and don't even...
618,00:26:00.07,00:26:00.07,"Oh, God, I can't eat a clam."
619,00:26:01.33,00:26:01.33,Like a piece of gum. Think of it like a piece of gum.
620,00:26:03.13,00:26:03.13,"-No, I'll throw up. -Yeah."
621,00:26:04.33,00:26:04.33,For real.
622,00:26:05.33,00:26:05.33,BRIAN:  Tanya is having
623,00:26:06.67,00:26:06.67, a tough time right now
624,00:26:07.83,00:26:07.83, adjusting to  the survival element.
625,00:26:09.20,00:26:09.20,We're trying to slowly nurse her back to health.
626,00:26:11.03,00:26:11.03,"She needs a lot of rest, she needs some water"
627,00:26:12.67,00:26:12.67,and a little bit of food-- she hasn't eaten much.
628,00:26:14.53,00:26:14.53,So I'm a little concerned about her health.
629,00:26:16.20,00:26:16.20,"Ever since I threw up on that seafood,"
630,00:26:18.03,00:26:18.03,"it's making my stomach, like..."
631,00:26:19.33,00:26:19.33,"I know, she can't."
632,00:26:20.33,00:26:20.33,TANYA: It associates it.
633,00:26:45.60,00:26:45.60,(flies buzzing)
634,00:26:46.70,00:26:46.70,CLAY: Dang!
635,00:26:48.80,00:26:48.80,"Look at them, they're all over the beach!"
636,00:26:51.90,00:26:51.90,My God.
637,00:26:53.57,00:26:53.57,"Hey, y'all come check out the squid on the beach!"
638,00:26:56.10,00:26:56.10,"Well, look at them all up through here."
639,00:26:58.37,00:26:58.37,Look at there.
640,00:26:59.83,00:26:59.83,Isn't that squid?
641,00:27:01.80,00:27:01.80,You think they're edible?
642,00:27:02.80,00:27:02.80,"Yeah, but only if they're dead."
643,00:27:03.87,00:27:03.87,-If we cook them? -Smell that thing.
644,00:27:05.80,00:27:05.80,"Huh. I know, I smell it."
645,00:27:07.53,00:27:07.53,"That could be breakfast, guys, just right here."
646,00:27:09.27,00:27:09.27,I say let's go ahead and try some.
647,00:27:10.50,00:27:10.50,At least the tentacles; these are safe right here.
648,00:27:12.63,00:27:12.63,-The tentacles are safe? -Yeah.
649,00:27:14.03,00:27:14.03,"HELEN: This morning,  we found squid on the beach,"
650,00:27:17.30,00:27:17.30," and, um, I have, once  in my life, bought squid"
651,00:27:19.73,00:27:19.73," that wasn't cleaned,"
652,00:27:21.87,00:27:21.87,so I knew how to do it.
653,00:27:23.17,00:27:23.17,"Dude, we want to try and take"
654,00:27:24.63,00:27:24.63,"that skin off, too. See how we're getting these?"
655,00:27:26.53,00:27:26.53,-Really? -Yeah.
656,00:27:27.97,00:27:27.97,"Like, that skin comes right off. And I know"
657,00:27:29.87,00:27:29.87,we got to get every spot of ink off.
658,00:27:31.63,00:27:31.63,"CLAY: Helen-- everything's  serious, serious."
659,00:27:34.57,00:27:34.57,"I mean, there's no play to her."
660,00:27:36.20,00:27:36.20, She's supposed to be  some kind of marine expert.
661,00:27:38.20,00:27:38.20, She's kind of got the personality of an encyclopedia.
662,00:27:40.03,00:27:40.03," You open it up,"
663,00:27:41.73,00:27:41.73,there ain't nothing in there fun to read.
664,00:27:43.30,00:27:43.30,You only open it when you need information.
665,00:27:45.20,00:27:45.20,This does not cook long at all.
666,00:27:48.50,00:27:48.50,A minute or two?
667,00:27:49.70,00:27:49.70,"No, I'm telling you, it cooks quickly."
668,00:27:51.70,00:27:51.70,-But the longer the better or...? -No.
669,00:27:53.50,00:27:53.50,"Hell, I think that's got to get cooked a little bit."
670,00:27:56.43,00:27:56.43,"It might get more cooked, but it's going to be rubber."
671,00:27:58.77,00:27:58.77,HELEN:  I know how to cook squid.
672,00:28:01.00,00:28:01.00,I don't care if we don't like it right now
673,00:28:02.33,00:28:02.33,the taste isn't that good.
674,00:28:03.87,00:28:03.87,"We've got to have food if we're going to compete, you know."
675,00:28:10.97,00:28:10.97,-We got tree mail. -Y'all ready?
676,00:28:12.50,00:28:12.50,Got tree mail. What does it say?
677,00:28:14.03,00:28:14.03,"It says, ""Petals on the ocean"
678,00:28:17.83,00:28:17.83,"""drifting out to sea,"
679,00:28:19.53,00:28:19.53,"""Keep your tribe together, control your destiny,"
680,00:28:23.10,00:28:23.10,"""Life is like a flower, so be the first to bloom,"
681,00:28:26.47,00:28:26.47,"Fail to work together, face Tribal Council doom."""
682,00:28:31.10,00:28:31.10,Sounds to me like kind of a water deal and a swimming deal.
683,00:28:35.90,00:28:35.90,"STEPHANIE: I'm going to be  a little worried about me,"
684,00:28:38.43,00:28:38.43,just because I'm still honestly  not feeling very well.
685,00:28:41.53,00:28:41.53,I have to be able to do something to show the tribe
686,00:28:44.53,00:28:44.53,"that, you know, I'm still in this."
687,00:28:53.40,00:28:53.40,"PROBST: Okay, guys."
688,00:28:55.23,00:28:55.23,Welcome to today's immunity challenge.
689,00:28:56.67,00:28:56.67,First things first.
690,00:28:58.13,00:28:58.13,"Sook Jai, give it up."
691,00:29:01.63,00:29:01.63,Immunity back up for grabs.
692,00:29:03.77,00:29:03.77,Today's immunity challenge is pretty simple.
693,00:29:05.97,00:29:05.97,It's a floating lotus flower puzzle.
694,00:29:08.67,00:29:08.67,Six pieces are missing from that puzzle.
695,00:29:11.43,00:29:11.43,Those pieces have been tethered
696,00:29:12.50,00:29:12.50,to the bottom of the ocean floor.
697,00:29:13.87,00:29:13.87,"Your job: one tribe member at a time, swim out,"
698,00:29:16.50,00:29:16.50,"dive down ten feet, unclip the missing piece of the puzzle,"
699,00:29:20.97,00:29:20.97,swim back and get it in its spot.
700,00:29:22.80,00:29:22.80,"Each piece is unique, so it will only fit in one spot."
701,00:29:26.83,00:29:26.83,One person from each tribe will stay on the flower
702,00:29:29.10,00:29:29.10,and they will help navigate
703,00:29:30.57,00:29:30.57,those pieces into their appropriate spot.
704,00:29:32.97,00:29:32.97,First tribe back with their puzzle completed
705,00:29:34.67,00:29:34.67,and everybody sitting back on the flower wins immunity.
706,00:29:38.40,00:29:38.40,"You can tag out and have somebody else run a leg for you,"
707,00:29:42.23,00:29:42.23,"but you can only do so after you have swum out,"
708,00:29:44.53,00:29:44.53,touched the piece of puzzle and made your way back.
709,00:29:46.93,00:29:46.93,"Stephanie, you sat out yesterday."
710,00:29:47.93,00:29:47.93,Who's sitting out today?
711,00:29:49.03,00:29:49.03,"-Shii Ann. -Shii Ann, you'll stay"
712,00:29:50.90,00:29:50.90,"back here with me. Everybody else, swim out and take a spot."
713,00:29:52.93,00:29:52.93,Wait for my go.
714,00:29:57.50,00:29:57.50,"Here we go, guys!"
715,00:29:59.60,00:29:59.60,Immunity at stake!
716,00:30:00.77,00:30:00.77,-Survivors ready? -Yeah. -Yeah.
717,00:30:02.53,00:30:02.53,Go!
718,00:30:04.67,00:30:04.67,"Come on, Jed, let's go."
719,00:30:06.03,00:30:06.03,"Let's go, Brian."
720,00:30:07.97,00:30:07.97,"Get it, Jed."
721,00:30:09.83,00:30:09.83,Come on! You're doing great!
722,00:30:13.30,00:30:13.30,"Let's go, let's go!"

724,00:30:20.30,00:30:20.30,All right!
725,00:30:22.37,00:30:22.37,"You can do it, Jed!"
726,00:30:24.23,00:30:24.23,"Come on, baby."
727,00:30:25.27,00:30:25.27,"Go, Brian, go!"
728,00:30:26.87,00:30:26.87,(various team members shouting encouragement
729,00:30:29.10,00:30:29.10,"(cheering, whooping)"
730,00:30:32.43,00:30:32.43,"Sook Jai, go!"
731,00:30:35.77,00:30:35.77,Get it on.
732,00:30:37.50,00:30:37.50,"Chuay Gahn, go!"
733,00:30:39.57,00:30:39.57,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
734,00:30:40.80,00:30:40.80,"-Come on, Jake! -Way to go, Jake!"
735,00:30:42.17,00:30:42.17,It's on the front!
736,00:30:43.23,00:30:43.23,"Come on, Papa Jake!"
737,00:30:49.20,00:30:49.20,"-(all shouting) -Yeah, Jake!"

739,00:30:51.57,00:30:51.57,"Helen, over here!"
740,00:30:52.63,00:30:52.63,"PROBST: It's a tight race, guys."
741,00:30:54.37,00:30:54.37,You're both even.
742,00:30:55.47,00:30:55.47,"Let's go, let's go, let's go."
743,00:30:57.67,00:30:57.67,"Come on, Jake!"
744,00:30:59.13,00:30:59.13,You can do it!
745,00:31:00.03,00:31:00.03,"Sook Jai, go!"
746,00:31:04.27,00:31:04.27,"Go, Robb!"
747,00:31:05.53,00:31:05.53,"Come on, Helen."

753,00:31:22.83,00:31:22.83,Under the middle!
754,00:31:28.57,00:31:28.57,"Come on, Jan."
755,00:31:32.63,00:31:32.63,"-Come on, Robb! -Over here, Jan!"
756,00:31:34.60,00:31:34.60,(excited chattering)

758,00:31:43.77,00:31:43.77,"Right here, Jan."

760,00:31:46.47,00:31:46.47,PROBST: Sook Jai has the lead.
761,00:31:50.60,00:31:50.60,"Drop, Penny, come on!"
762,00:31:59.23,00:31:59.23,PROBST: Now Penny's in trouble.
763,00:32:01.53,00:32:01.53,"Chuay Gahn, go!"
764,00:32:05.43,00:32:05.43,I went past the purple one.
765,00:32:07.80,00:32:07.80,Three pieces missing each.
766,00:32:09.10,00:32:09.10,It's on the front!
767,00:32:17.70,00:32:17.70,PROBST: Penny's given up.
768,00:32:20.63,00:32:20.63,She's coming to tag out.
769,00:32:26.40,00:32:26.40,"Jed, got to touch, tag her. Go!"
770,00:32:32.77,00:32:32.77,"Go, baby, get there. Get that."
771,00:32:34.63,00:32:34.63,"Over here, Ghandia, right here."
772,00:32:38.00,00:32:38.00,(teams shouting encouragement)
773,00:32:44.67,00:32:44.67,"-Go, Ghandi! -You got it!"
774,00:32:46.13,00:32:46.13,Come on!

776,00:32:48.27,00:32:48.27,You guys are very even.

781,00:32:55.47,00:32:55.47,"Come on, you can do it."
782,00:32:57.20,00:32:57.20,"Sook Jai, go!"
783,00:33:07.03,00:33:07.03,"Chuay Gahn, go!"
784,00:33:16.53,00:33:16.53,Still anybody's race.
785,00:33:18.43,00:33:18.43,Two pieces left in each tribe.

793,00:33:37.97,00:33:37.97,"Chuay Gahn, go!"
794,00:33:45.33,00:33:45.33,Chuay Gahn also on their last piece.
795,00:33:50.77,00:33:50.77,It's very tight.
796,00:33:51.90,00:33:51.90,Stephanie and Clay.
797,00:33:56.03,00:33:56.03,(all shouting)
798,00:33:58.10,00:33:58.10,It's another tight race!
799,00:34:08.47,00:34:08.47,Sook Jai wins immunity!
800,00:34:10.33,00:34:10.33,(cheering)
801,00:34:18.67,00:34:18.67,"You guys want it, come get it."
802,00:34:27.20,00:34:27.20,Well earned.
803,00:34:28.20,00:34:28.20,Yeah! Whoo!
804,00:34:30.63,00:34:30.63,"Chuay Gahn, we have a date tonight at Tribal Council,"
805,00:34:32.83,00:34:32.83,where another member will be voted out of the tribe.
806,00:35:06.83,00:35:06.83,Mm-mm-mm.
807,00:35:08.00,00:35:08.00,So close.
808,00:35:09.03,00:35:09.03,That's the beauty of these games.
809,00:35:11.23,00:35:11.23,-Mm. -There's no such thing
810,00:35:13.20,00:35:13.20,-as second place. -Right.
811,00:35:14.60,00:35:14.60,You either win or you lose.
812,00:35:16.20,00:35:16.20,Right.
813,00:35:18.07,00:35:18.07,CLAY: We lost again today  in the challenge.
814,00:35:20.10,00:35:20.10,We didn't lose by very much.
815,00:35:21.87,00:35:21.87,"We had a couple of dumb, dumb, dumb,"
816,00:35:24.43,00:35:24.43,"dumb-ass mistakes, matter of fact."
817,00:35:25.87,00:35:25.87,"Janny, you couldn't find it, is that what happened?"
818,00:35:28.33,00:35:28.33,"Yeah, I thought it was on the end."
819,00:35:30.40,00:35:30.40,-I forgot it was in the middle. -Oh.
820,00:35:32.27,00:35:32.27,"So I kept going, so I missed-- lost valuable time."
821,00:35:36.37,00:35:36.37,"I'm sorry, guys."
822,00:35:37.80,00:35:37.80,I tried to do the best.
823,00:35:40.00,00:35:40.00,"BRIAN: Janny, she just had  a little bit of hard time"
824,00:35:42.10,00:35:42.10," finding the hook, and, uh,"
825,00:35:44.23,00:35:44.23,that really put us back.
826,00:35:47.87,00:35:47.87,HELEN: I think the morale  is a little down today.
827,00:35:49.93,00:35:49.93, I think we're all trying to  keep each other's spirits up.
828,00:35:54.10,00:35:54.10,"I mean, now we know nobody's-- somebody's going home tonight."
829,00:35:56.10,00:35:56.10,"You know, that's never good."
830,00:35:58.90,00:35:58.90,I want to vote for Helen before Jan.
831,00:36:01.40,00:36:01.40,No.
832,00:36:02.40,00:36:02.40,"She's getting on my nerves, yo."
833,00:36:03.80,00:36:03.80,But strength-wise...
834,00:36:05.23,00:36:05.23,That's the only reason.
835,00:36:07.17,00:36:07.17,"I mean, everything is a big deal."
836,00:36:09.33,00:36:09.33,Yeah.
837,00:36:10.70,00:36:10.70,"""I am going to go over here and I am going to pick up"
838,00:36:13.03,00:36:13.03,"this one leaf and I'm going to bring it back."""
839,00:36:15.03,00:36:15.03,(laughter)
840,00:36:16.30,00:36:16.30,GHANDIA:  I'm not really sure
841,00:36:17.70,00:36:17.70, who I'm voting for tonight;  it's a tossup.
842,00:36:19.50,00:36:19.50, There's somebody who I want  to vote for because
843,00:36:22.90,00:36:22.90,"she's getting on my nerves, which is Helen."
844,00:36:25.17,00:36:25.17, And then there's somebody who I don't necessarily want to
845,00:36:28.13,00:36:28.13," vote for, but I think she's  ready to go, which is Tanya."
846,00:36:31.93,00:36:31.93,HELEN: This is going to be  a terribly hard vote for me.
847,00:36:35.60,00:36:35.60,Everybody loves Tanya.
848,00:36:36.77,00:36:36.77,We all love Tanya.
849,00:36:38.07,00:36:38.07, That may play in her favor.
850,00:36:39.47,00:36:39.47, So I think  it's one of those nights
851,00:36:41.17,00:36:41.17,where it could be anybody.
852,00:37:01.13,00:37:01.13,"Well, it's never fun coming to Tribal Council,"
853,00:37:03.67,00:37:03.67,but two times in a row.
854,00:37:05.93,00:37:05.93,"Ted, how is the morale in this tribe?"
855,00:37:08.20,00:37:08.20,"Um, I think the morale is slowly declining."
856,00:37:11.93,00:37:11.93,"However, we're still in high spirits."
857,00:37:13.53,00:37:13.53,And we're still a family.
858,00:37:15.43,00:37:15.43,"Ghandia, is what Ted said true?"
859,00:37:16.50,00:37:16.50,Is the morale declining a little?
860,00:37:18.00,00:37:18.00,I think it might be declining just a little bit
861,00:37:20.30,00:37:20.30,because our losses are so close
862,00:37:22.90,00:37:22.90,that I think that makes us a little sad.
863,00:37:24.73,00:37:24.73,"But, um, we just keep believing that"
864,00:37:27.43,00:37:27.43,when we do win that it'll be a big win.
865,00:37:30.77,00:37:30.77,"They think we're a wash, and I think they've got"
866,00:37:32.77,00:37:32.77,some days coming where they're going to see
867,00:37:34.23,00:37:34.23,a whole lot of you here instead of us.
868,00:37:37.93,00:37:37.93,"Tanya, did you have any idea it would be this tough"
869,00:37:40.40,00:37:40.40,only six days in?
870,00:37:41.73,00:37:41.73,"No, I had no idea it would be this tough."
871,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,Been camping before lots of times
872,00:37:46.60,00:37:46.60,and just didn't think it would be this hard.
873,00:37:48.63,00:37:48.63,PROBST: Who here will admit
874,00:37:49.93,00:37:49.93,"that at least one point in these first six days,"
875,00:37:52.47,00:37:52.47,you have to assess how you're fitting in with everyone else?
876,00:37:55.17,00:37:55.17,That is the object of this game.
877,00:37:56.73,00:37:56.73,You don't know any of these people.
878,00:37:58.67,00:37:58.67,"Helen, you're starting to nod."
879,00:38:00.33,00:38:00.33,"Oh, yeah, I mean, you'd have to be crazy"
880,00:38:02.47,00:38:02.47,if you didn't think that way.
881,00:38:04.10,00:38:04.10,"I-I wonder every day, like, gee, you know,"
882,00:38:06.40,00:38:06.40,I wonder if they like me.
883,00:38:07.50,00:38:07.50,I wonder if I said the right thing.
884,00:38:09.10,00:38:09.10,Do they find me too in control all the time?
885,00:38:10.87,00:38:10.87,"I mean, they threw me"
886,00:38:12.73,00:38:12.73,"this wonderful anniversary party the other night,"
887,00:38:14.97,00:38:14.97,"and I'll tell you, it was all I could keep from doing"
888,00:38:19.17,00:38:19.17,to not run into the back of the cave and just absolutely cry.
889,00:38:22.57,00:38:22.57,"I really tried to hold it together,"
890,00:38:25.10,00:38:25.10,but it was one of the nicest things anybody's ever
891,00:38:27.00,00:38:27.00,"done for me, so I was really... I was touched."
892,00:38:29.40,00:38:29.40,Sounds like a beautiful moment.
893,00:38:32.33,00:38:32.33,"Oh, don't even-- don't start."
894,00:38:33.97,00:38:33.97,'Cause I'm under orders not to cry.
895,00:38:36.00,00:38:36.00,Why are you under orders not to cry?
896,00:38:37.97,00:38:37.97,"'Cause I work with all these men, they're, like,"
897,00:38:40.73,00:38:40.73,"Green Berets and SEALs,"
898,00:38:42.20,00:38:42.20,"and they go, ""Okay, you can't cry."""
899,00:38:44.17,00:38:44.17,"I am totally un-- no, I'm not ki--"
900,00:38:46.07,00:38:46.07,"I can't go back there if I do, because they'll give me"
901,00:38:48.93,00:38:48.93,"such a ration for the next year, I-- no."
902,00:38:52.33,00:38:52.33,"Ghandia, what are you basing your vote on tonight?"
903,00:38:55.67,00:38:55.67,I'm basing my vote on...
904,00:38:59.87,00:38:59.87,the person's ability to actually mesh
905,00:39:03.57,00:39:03.57,with the rest of us.
906,00:39:04.83,00:39:04.83,I think that's really important.
907,00:39:07.13,00:39:07.13,There has to be a good camaraderie amongst all of us.
908,00:39:11.10,00:39:11.10,"Jan, how tough will tonight's vote be?"
909,00:39:13.70,00:39:13.70,It will be hard.
910,00:39:15.53,00:39:15.53,"It's not one I want to make, but, um,"
911,00:39:18.30,00:39:18.30,it needs to be for the better of the entire group.
912,00:39:23.57,00:39:23.57,It is time to vote.
913,00:39:25.87,00:39:25.87,"Tanya, you're first."
914,00:39:51.67,00:39:51.67,"Like an older brother would to a younger sister,"
915,00:39:53.80,00:39:53.80,"got to take care of you,"
916,00:39:54.93,00:39:54.93,got to make sure you get a full meal tonight.
917,00:39:57.33,00:39:57.33,"So, Tanya, need you to get better, okay? Enjoy."
918,00:39:59.50,00:39:59.50,Talk to you soon.
919,00:40:20.23,00:40:20.23,I don't feel comfortable with how you try
920,00:40:21.93,00:40:21.93,to keep your emotions in check.
921,00:40:24.33,00:40:24.33,"And also, I just don't think"
922,00:40:26.67,00:40:26.67,that you effectively handle stress.
923,00:40:29.43,00:40:29.43,Seems like you kind of get too anxious
924,00:40:31.60,00:40:31.60,"and just start bugging out, frankly."
925,00:40:33.93,00:40:33.93,"I think, in the long run, that's going to hurt the group."
926,00:40:55.60,00:40:55.60,I'll go tally the votes.
927,00:41:03.47,00:41:03.47,"Once the votes are read, the decision is final."
928,00:41:05.37,00:41:05.37,The person voted out will be
929,00:41:06.70,00:41:06.70,asked to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
930,00:41:08.80,00:41:08.80,I'll read the votes.
931,00:41:13.47,00:41:13.47,First vote.
932,00:41:15.43,00:41:15.43,Tanya.
933,00:41:19.33,00:41:19.33,Helen.
934,00:41:25.53,00:41:25.53,"Two votes Helen, one vote Tanya."
935,00:41:32.40,00:41:32.40,Tanya.
936,00:41:33.40,00:41:33.40,Tennessee.
937,00:41:34.70,00:41:34.70,"Two votes Tanya, two votes Helen."
938,00:41:41.83,00:41:41.83,Tennessee.
939,00:41:43.33,00:41:43.33,"Three votes Tanya, two votes Helen."
940,00:41:50.57,00:41:50.57,Tanya. That's four.
941,00:41:52.53,00:41:52.53,That's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
942,00:42:04.97,00:42:04.97,"Tanya, the tribe has spoken."
943,00:42:09.80,00:42:09.80,"Love you, Tanya."
944,00:42:23.97,00:42:23.97,"You guys seem like a good, strong, likable tribe."
945,00:42:27.63,00:42:27.63,The only way to start winning is to keep that togetherness.
946,00:42:30.67,00:42:30.67,"Head back to camp, get some sleep."
947,00:42:47.77,00:42:47.77, Stay tuned for scenes  from our next episode.
948,00:42:53.97,00:42:53.97,PROBST:  Next time on Survivor...
949,00:42:56.10,00:42:56.10,The competition between Sook Jai and Chuay Gahn heats up.
950,00:42:59.03,00:42:59.03,(grunting)
951,00:43:00.77,00:43:00.77,"No, no, no! Foul!"
952,00:43:02.33,00:43:02.33, Will Chuay Gahn  make a comeback?
953,00:43:03.70,00:43:03.70,Yeah!
954,00:43:05.20,00:43:05.20,Damn it!
955,00:43:06.70,00:43:06.70,PROBST: And an incident  sends shock waves
956,00:43:08.30,00:43:08.30, through the Chuay Gahn camp.
957,00:43:09.23,00:43:09.23,I didn't deny ...
958,00:43:10.97,00:43:10.97,(screaming)
959,00:43:18.70,00:43:18.70,"Chuay Gahn, this has been the opportunity of a lifetime."
960,00:43:22.40,00:43:22.40,"It's been a great experience, and it does change your life."
961,00:43:26.07,00:43:26.07,I learned that I take things at home for granted.
962,00:43:28.93,00:43:28.93,And I'm not mad at any of you for picking me.
963,00:43:31.97,00:43:31.97,"And I just love every one of you,"
964,00:43:34.00,00:43:34.00,and I hope you bring it in and win the million dollars.
965,00:43:37.00,00:43:37.00,I hope you have a great time.
