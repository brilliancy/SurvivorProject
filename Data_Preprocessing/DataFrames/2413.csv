13,00:00:29.40,00:00:29.40,FROM CAMP WITH HER LOVED ONE.
14,00:00:31.40,00:00:31.40,KAT'S DECISION NOT TO TAKETARZAN
15,00:00:33.60,00:00:33.60,AND HIS WIFE OF 30 YEARS AND
16,00:00:35.53,00:00:35.53,CHRISTINA AND HER ALING FATHER
17,00:00:37.67,00:00:37.67,DID NOT SIT WELL WITH SABRINA.

19,00:00:41.43,00:00:41.43,ABOUT KAT'S SELFISHNESS.

21,00:00:44.97,00:00:44.97,REASON TO MAKE ME VOTE OFF KAT.
22,00:00:46.87,00:00:46.87,Jeff: IN A GRUELING

33,00:01:11.97,00:01:11.97,I DO THINK KAT HAS A GOOD
34,00:01:13.90,00:01:13.90,SHOT AT GETTING A LOT OF JURY
35,00:01:15.83,00:01:15.83,VOTES JUST BECAUSE SHE HASN'T
36,00:01:17.37,00:01:17.37,PISSED A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF BUT I
37,00:01:19.07,00:01:19.07,THINK SABRINA IS SMART ENOUGH TO
38,00:01:20.43,00:01:20.43,SWAY THE JURY AND TOTALLY SCREW
39,00:01:22.03,00:01:22.03,ME OVER IN THE END.

49,00:01:41.17,00:01:41.17,THE GAME.
50,00:01:42.07,00:01:42.07,"KAT, THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN."
51,00:01:44.27,00:01:44.27,WILL THE WOMEN CONTINUE TO TAKE
52,00:01:45.93,00:01:45.93,OUT THEIR OWN?
53,00:01:46.90,00:01:46.90,"OR WILL TARZAN, THE LAST MAN"
54,00:01:49.03,00:01:49.03,"STANDING, BE THE NEXT TO GO?"
55,00:01:51.37,00:01:51.37,"SIX ARE LEFT, WHO WILL BE VOTED"

58,00:02:17.67,00:02:17.67,"OH, MY GOD."
59,00:02:18.53,00:02:18.53,YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DAMAGE
60,00:02:20.10,00:02:20.10,CONTROL.
61,00:02:20.47,00:02:20.47,HER LAST STATEMENT WAS HOW
62,00:02:22.83,00:02:22.83,FUNNY A BLINDSIDE IS.
63,00:02:24.20,00:02:24.20,"OH, MY GOD!"
64,00:02:26.37,00:02:26.37,HOW IRONIC WAS THAT?
65,00:02:28.33,00:02:28.33,"IF I WERE THE GIRLS,"
66,00:02:31.57,00:02:31.57,I WOULD HAVE VOTED MEET OUT
67,00:02:33.00,00:02:33.00,BEFORE KAT.
68,00:02:33.77,00:02:33.77,THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE
69,00:02:34.53,00:02:34.53,SMARTEST THING THEY COULD DO BUT
70,00:02:35.97,00:02:35.97,THEY DIDN'T DO IT.
71,00:02:37.13,00:02:37.13,"AND NOW THAT THEY'VE DONE THAT,"
72,00:02:39.53,00:02:39.53,I HAVE A SUBPLOT WHERE I MIGHT
73,00:02:41.40,00:02:41.40,BE ABLE TO ARRANGE MYSELF TO BE
74,00:02:43.20,00:02:43.20,THE TOP THREE.
75,00:02:44.63,00:02:44.63,BUT OF COURSE I WOULDN'T REVEAL
76,00:02:46.50,00:02:46.50,ANY OF THAT RIGHT NOW.
77,00:02:47.67,00:02:47.67,I'M JUST HOPING TO MAKE IT TO
78,00:02:49.80,00:02:49.80,FOUR.
79,00:02:52.20,00:02:52.20,YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO ME GETTING
80,00:02:53.73,00:02:53.73,"DOWN TO NUMBER FOUR, RIGHT?"
81,00:02:55.00,00:02:55.00,NOT AT ALL.
82,00:02:55.77,00:02:55.77,"OKAY, SO I'M THINKING THE"
83,00:02:57.70,00:02:57.70,BEST THING FOR YOU LADIES WOULD

85,00:03:04.57,00:03:04.57,CHRISTINA TO BE THE LAST THREE
86,00:03:06.93,00:03:06.93,"STANDING, BECAUSE NOBODY WILL"
87,00:03:08.43,00:03:08.43,VOTE FOR CHRISTINA.
88,00:03:09.97,00:03:09.97,I KNOW.
89,00:03:10.63,00:03:10.63,"AND IF I GO ON THE JURY, I"
90,00:03:13.37,00:03:13.37,THINK I CAN CONVINCE THEM TO
91,00:03:14.53,00:03:14.53,VOTE FOR YOU.
92,00:03:15.57,00:03:15.57,HERE'S MY ONLY CONCERN.
93,00:03:17.60,00:03:17.60,YEAH.
94,00:03:18.20,00:03:18.20,IS I JUST START TO WONDER IF
95,00:03:20.67,00:03:20.67,ALICIA IS REALLY GOING TO WANT
96,00:03:22.10,00:03:22.10,TO TAKE ME.
97,00:03:22.87,00:03:22.87,"OKAY, WELL, I THINK ALICIA"
98,00:03:24.90,00:03:24.90,HAS A STRONG AFFINITY FOR YOU AS
99,00:03:29.90,00:03:29.90,FAR AS JUST LIKING YOU AND
100,00:03:32.33,00:03:32.33,"WANTING TO BE YOUR FRIEND AND,"
101,00:03:33.40,00:03:33.40,"YOU KNOW, GO WITH WHATEVER YOU"
102,00:03:35.13,00:03:35.13,SAY.
103,00:03:35.50,00:03:35.50,"BUT HERE'S THE THING, THE"
104,00:03:37.17,00:03:37.17,BIGGEST THREAT IS--
105,00:03:38.70,00:03:38.70,CHELSEA.
106,00:03:39.37,00:03:39.37,CHELSEA.
107,00:03:40.00,00:03:40.00,AND SHE'S MY FRIEND.
108,00:03:40.87,00:03:40.87,"I KNOW, I KNOW."
109,00:03:41.87,00:03:41.87,IT'S SO HARD.
110,00:03:44.07,00:03:44.07,WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM TRIBAL
111,00:03:46.43,00:03:46.43,TONIGHT TARZAN PULLED ME ASIDE
112,00:03:48.30,00:03:48.30,AND WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT HE
113,00:03:50.33,00:03:50.33,THOUGHT THE BEST PLAN FOR ME WAS
114,00:03:52.23,00:03:52.23,AND THAT IS I GET RID OF CHELSEA
115,00:03:54.23,00:03:54.23,"AND ALICIA, AND AS CRAZY AS"
116,00:03:57.50,00:03:57.50,"TARZAN IS, IT IS WHAT I KNOW TO"
117,00:04:00.23,00:04:00.23,BE TRUE.
118,00:04:01.27,00:04:01.27,"IF I SEND CHELSEA HOME, THAT"
119,00:04:02.63,00:04:02.63,WILL BE MY WORST NIGHT HERE.
120,00:04:10.53,00:04:10.53,YOU ALL STAY AND I'LL GO.
121,00:04:12.20,00:04:12.20,OKAY.
122,00:04:15.97,00:04:15.97,WHEN YOU--
123,00:04:17.23,00:04:17.23,"WAIT, DO YOU THINK-- MY THING"
124,00:04:19.57,00:04:19.57,"IS I KNOW I CAN BEAT CHRISTINA,"
125,00:04:22.30,00:04:22.30,BUT DO YOU THINK I CAN WIN
126,00:04:23.83,00:04:23.83,"AGAINST-- KIM, KIM IS MY WHOLE--"
127,00:04:25.93,00:04:25.93,MY PLAN IS TO HYPE IT UP FOR
128,00:04:28.73,00:04:28.73,YOU WHEN I GET ON THE JURY.
129,00:04:31.80,00:04:31.80,"SEE, AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL"
130,00:04:33.00,00:04:33.00,BE HARD TO DO AT ALL.
131,00:04:35.63,00:04:35.63,BECAUSE THEY FEEL BETRAYED BY
132,00:04:37.40,00:04:37.40,HER.
133,00:04:37.77,00:04:37.77,I'VE BEEN DOING THIS IN
134,00:04:39.17,00:04:39.17,SEGMENTS.
135,00:04:39.57,00:04:39.57,DON'T BE THE FIRST ONE VOTE OUT.
136,00:04:40.63,00:04:40.63,"MAKE IT TO THE MERGE, MAKE IT TO"
137,00:04:43.27,00:04:43.27,SEEING MY WIFE.
138,00:04:44.10,00:04:44.10,MAKING IT TO NUMBER FOUR.
139,00:04:45.97,00:04:45.97,AND MAYBE SLIPPING INTO NUMBER
140,00:04:47.47,00:04:47.47,THREE.
141,00:04:47.93,00:04:47.93,"EVEN IF I MAKE IT TO THREE, AND"
142,00:04:49.37,00:04:49.37,"I LOSE, IT WON'T BE A TERRIBLE"
143,00:04:50.97,00:04:50.97,THING.
144,00:04:51.47,00:04:51.47,I JUST WON'T BUY SHOCKS FOR MY
145,00:04:53.93,00:04:53.93,CAR.
146,00:04:54.10,00:04:54.10,THAT'S ALL.
147,00:05:27.43,00:05:27.43,"LOOK, THIS IS A CUP."
148,00:05:31.77,00:05:31.77,LOOK HOW MUCH IS INSIDE OF IT.
149,00:05:34.47,00:05:34.47,IT MIGHT JUST BE BETTER TO
150,00:05:36.17,00:05:36.17,SAVE IT FOR DINNER.
151,00:05:37.03,00:05:37.03,"RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE THE"
152,00:05:38.80,00:05:38.80,GAME IS THREE VERSUS THREE.
153,00:05:41.43,00:05:41.43,"SABRINA, KIM, AND I, AND ALICIA,CHRISTINA AND TARZAN."
154,00:05:45.00,00:05:45.00,"I GENUINELY THINK THAT ALICIA,"
155,00:05:48.43,00:05:48.43,CHRISTINA AND TARZAN THINK THEY
156,00:05:51.17,00:05:51.17,"HAVE KIM IN THEIR ALLIANCE,"
157,00:05:52.57,00:05:52.57,"WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE I KNOW"
158,00:05:54.30,00:05:54.30,THAT SHE'S GOT MY BACK.
159,00:05:59.80,00:05:59.80,"DUE, I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT"
160,00:06:02.30,00:06:02.30,"FOOD ALL NIGHT, AND I WAS JUST"
161,00:06:04.23,00:06:04.23,LIKE WHY DO I KEEP ON DREAMING
162,00:06:06.73,00:06:06.73,ABOUT FOOD?
163,00:06:07.63,00:06:07.63,"TODAY'S REWARD, I SOMEHOW"
164,00:06:11.57,00:06:11.57,"PULL OUT A WINNER, THEN I THINK"
165,00:06:13.73,00:06:13.73,YOU NEED TO GO.
166,00:06:14.93,00:06:14.93,YOU'RE SO SWEET.
167,00:06:15.97,00:06:15.97,I FEEL THE SAME.
168,00:06:16.50,00:06:16.50,I'M TRYING TO REEL CHRISTINA
169,00:06:18.93,00:06:18.93,IN A LITTLE BIT.
170,00:06:19.80,00:06:19.80,I KNOW THAT CHRISTINA IS
171,00:06:22.40,00:06:22.40,"ALICIA'S PUPPET, AND I'M TRYING"
172,00:06:23.60,00:06:23.60,TO HELP HER SEE THE BIG SCHEME
173,00:06:26.43,00:06:26.43,"OF THINGS, THE BIG PICTURE."
174,00:06:28.03,00:06:28.03,I THINK ALICIA WANTS TO TAKE YOU
175,00:06:29.90,00:06:29.90,AND TARZAN.
176,00:06:30.83,00:06:30.83,BUT I THINK JUST BECAUSE HE'S A
177,00:06:32.70,00:06:32.70,MALE AND ALL THOSE GUYSES ARE
178,00:06:34.40,00:06:34.40,"PISSED AT THE GIRLS, THAT"
179,00:06:37.53,00:06:37.53,"THEY'RE GONNA VOTE FOR HIM, AND"
180,00:06:40.97,00:06:40.97,THAT MEANS HE CAN'T GO TO THE
181,00:06:42.60,00:06:42.60,END.
182,00:06:43.07,00:06:43.07,IF I CAN GET CHRISTINA TO SEE
183,00:06:44.47,00:06:44.47,THAT TARZAN CAN'T GO TO THE
184,00:06:45.80,00:06:45.80,"FINAL THREE, MAYBE SHE'LL FALL"
185,00:06:47.43,00:06:47.43,IN WITH KIM AND I.
186,00:06:49.23,00:06:49.23,I FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE SOME KIND
187,00:06:50.47,00:06:50.47,OF BOND WITH ALICIA.
188,00:06:52.80,00:06:52.80,SO IF YOU COULD KEEP THAT
189,00:06:54.63,00:06:54.63,BETWEEN US BECAUSE I'M JUST
190,00:06:56.17,00:06:56.17,TALKING OUT LOUD RIGHT NOW.
191,00:06:58.17,00:06:58.17,BUT--
192,00:06:58.53,00:06:58.53,"YEAH, I'LL JUST KEEP IT QUIET."
193,00:07:04.53,00:07:04.53,SHUT UP.
194,00:07:05.73,00:07:05.73,"NO KIDDING, NO JOKE."
195,00:07:07.33,00:07:07.33,WHAT DID SHE SAY?
196,00:07:08.43,00:07:08.43,IF THERE WAS AN AWARD
197,00:07:10.73,00:07:10.73,CHALLENGE AND SHE COULD TAKE TWO
198,00:07:12.27,00:07:12.27,"SHE SAID,""I'M GOING TO TAKE"
199,00:07:14.37,00:07:14.37,"YOU."""
200,00:07:14.80,00:07:14.80,"AND THEN SHE SAID ME, AND ALICIA"
201,00:07:17.33,00:07:17.33,AND TARZAN ARE IN AALLIANCE FOR
202,00:07:20.47,00:07:20.47,THE FINAL THREE.
203,00:07:21.00,00:07:21.00,WHEN CHELSEA AND CHRISTINA
204,00:07:24.63,00:07:24.63,"WENT TO TREE MAIL, CHRISTINA"
205,00:07:27.03,00:07:27.03,TOLD US EVERYTHING CHELSEA SAID
206,00:07:28.47,00:07:28.47,ON THEIR WALK.
207,00:07:29.30,00:07:29.30,MY FIRST QUESTION I WANTED
208,00:07:30.93,00:07:30.93,ANSWER WAS DID CHELSEA BLOW MY
209,00:07:32.67,00:07:32.67,COVER BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN
210,00:07:33.87,00:07:33.87,PLAYING BOTH SIDES?
211,00:07:35.33,00:07:35.33,"ALICIA, TARZAN, AND CHRISTINA"
212,00:07:36.60,00:07:36.60,ALL THINK I MAKE A FOURSOME FOR
213,00:07:39.23,00:07:39.23,"THEM, AND THEN CHELSEA AND"
214,00:07:40.87,00:07:40.87,SABRINA THINK I AM THEIR THIRD.

435,00:14:16.70,00:14:16.70,"OH, MY GOD."
436,00:14:17.80,00:14:17.80,THE THING IS I THINK WE CAN DO
437,00:14:20.67,00:14:20.67,IT.
438,00:14:21.13,00:14:21.13,THAT'S WHAT I GET EXCITED ABOUT.
439,00:14:21.87,00:14:21.87,I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON A
440,00:14:23.73,00:14:23.73,HONEYMOON RIGHT NOW.

447,00:14:32.90,00:14:32.90,REMEMBER WHOIS AND WHAT I'M
448,00:14:34.73,00:14:34.73,ABOUT AND WHAT I'M DOING HERE.
449,00:14:35.93,00:14:35.93,I FEEL LIKE MY HEAD IS SO MUCH
450,00:14:38.00,00:14:38.00,CLEARER TODAY THAN IT WAS
451,00:14:39.23,00:14:39.23,YESTERDAY SO THE REWARD WAS HUGE
452,00:14:41.57,00:14:41.57,FOR ME.
453,00:14:49.37,00:14:49.37,I'M-- I'M LIVID.
454,00:14:51.80,00:14:51.80,"OH, YOU'RE LIVID."
455,00:14:53.13,00:14:53.13,SO AM I.
456,00:14:54.37,00:14:54.37,"SO, CHELSEA WAS ASKED, ""WHO"

459,00:15:00.47,00:15:00.47,"AND HER RESPONSE S, I'M GOING TO"
460,00:15:02.03,00:15:02.03,PICK THE PERSON HOW I PLAY THE
461,00:15:03.33,00:15:03.33,"GAME, WHICH IS FAIR."""
462,00:15:04.53,00:15:04.53,SO WHO DOES SHE PICK?
463,00:15:06.73,00:15:06.73,KIM.
464,00:15:07.20,00:15:07.20,WHY THE HELL DOES KIM NEED TO GO
465,00:15:09.13,00:15:09.13,ON A THIRD REWARD.
466,00:15:10.30,00:15:10.30,"TELL ME TO MY FACE, THAT WAS A"
467,00:15:12.33,00:15:12.33,FAIR CHOICE.
468,00:15:12.73,00:15:12.73,"NO, AND NOT ONLY THAT, ON THE"
469,00:15:16.13,00:15:16.13,WALK FROM TREE MAIL--
470,00:15:17.67,00:15:17.67,SHE SAID SHE WOULD TAKE YOU.
471,00:15:18.53,00:15:18.53,THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
472,00:15:19.70,00:15:19.70,US THREE DON'T BUDGE ON WHO WE
473,00:15:22.53,00:15:22.53,VOTE NEXT.
474,00:15:22.87,00:15:22.87,WHO ARE WE VOTING FOR?
475,00:15:24.20,00:15:24.20,WE'RE VOTING FOR CHELSEA.
476,00:15:25.93,00:15:25.93,THAT MEANS OUR THREE VOTES
477,00:15:28.27,00:15:28.27,NEED TO BE ALIGNED.
478,00:15:29.57,00:15:29.57,THEIR THREE VOTES ARE GOING TO
479,00:15:31.33,00:15:31.33,BE A TIE.
480,00:15:32.03,00:15:32.03,THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO FORCE ONE
481,00:15:33.27,00:15:33.27,"OF THEM, WHICH WOULD BE KIM, TO"
482,00:15:34.80,00:15:34.80,STICK TRUE TO WHAT SHE SAID.
483,00:15:38.53,00:15:38.53,KIM AND I TRUST EACH OTHER BUT
484,00:15:40.07,00:15:40.07,I'M NOT GOING TO PASS IT BY HER
485,00:15:42.10,00:15:42.10,"THAT SHE'S NOT THINKING OF, YOU"
486,00:15:45.63,00:15:45.63,"KNOW, OTHER THINGS, OTHER"
487,00:15:48.13,00:15:48.13,OPTIONS.
488,00:15:48.60,00:15:48.60,HOWEVER I THINK IT IS STUPID
489,00:15:49.57,00:15:49.57,THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO SIT NEXT
490,00:15:51.33,00:15:51.33,TO SABRINA AND CHELSEA.
491,00:15:54.07,00:15:54.07,"TARZAN, MYSELF AND CHRISTINA ARE"
492,00:15:55.83,00:15:55.83,SOLID AND IF THEY WANT TO BE
493,00:15:57.63,00:15:57.63,"SOLID, COOL, LET THEM BE SOLID."
494,00:15:59.63,00:15:59.63,LET THEM DRAW ROCKS.
495,00:16:00.83,00:16:00.83,LET THEM BE STUPID.
496,00:16:01.67,00:16:01.67,"WHEN THEY COME BACK, IF KIM"
497,00:16:03.87,00:16:03.87,COMES BACK AND SAYS LET'S NOT DO
498,00:16:06.77,00:16:06.77,"CHELSEA, LET'S DO, BLAH, BLAH,"
499,00:16:08.47,00:16:08.47,"BLAH, THAT WOULD BE A DEAD GIVE"
500,00:16:10.60,00:16:10.60,AWAY.
501,00:16:11.00,00:16:11.00,THE TWO BIG PLAYERS WHO WILL
502,00:16:12.50,00:16:12.50,KNOCK YOU GUYS OUT OF THE LAST
503,00:16:13.57,00:16:13.57,THREE ARE KIM AND CHELSEA AND I
504,00:16:15.10,00:16:15.10,BELIEVE THEY'RE DECEIVING US AND
505,00:16:16.20,00:16:16.20,THAT THEY'RE A TEAM.
506,00:16:17.13,00:16:17.13,SO I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE A
507,00:16:19.00,00:16:19.00,BETTER CHANCE IF I'M ONE OF THE
508,00:16:20.27,00:16:20.27,THREE ACTUALLY BECAUSE THOSE
509,00:16:22.13,00:16:22.13,THREE LADIES TOOK OFF.
510,00:16:24.80,00:16:24.80,IT'S SORT OF ALMOST A BLESSING
511,00:16:27.00,00:16:27.00,IN DISGUISE BECAUSE IT HELPED
512,00:16:28.50,00:16:28.50,UNITE ANOTHER PLOT THAT MIGHT
513,00:16:30.47,00:16:30.47,ALLOW ME TO SAY HERE POSSIBLY TO
514,00:16:31.80,00:16:31.80,THE LAST THREE.
515,00:16:35.00,00:16:35.00,SO--
516,00:16:37.27,00:16:37.27,HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?
517,00:16:38.43,00:16:38.43,WOULD YOU RATHER SIT NEXT TO HIM
518,00:16:40.13,00:16:40.13,OR WOULD YOU RATHER SIT NEXT TO
519,00:16:41.67,00:16:41.67,KIM?
520,00:16:42.03,00:16:42.03,I'M GOING TO BE PERFECTLY
521,00:16:43.10,00:16:43.10,"HONEST, I THINK KIM IS PROBABLY"
522,00:16:44.07,00:16:44.07,GOING TO GET MORE VOTES VERSUS
523,00:16:46.13,00:16:46.13,TARZAN.
524,00:16:46.47,00:16:46.47,IT'S NOT MUCH OF A THREAT.
525,00:16:47.53,00:16:47.53,"ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS THE"
526,00:16:48.60,00:16:48.60,NEXT MOVE.
527,00:16:49.53,00:16:49.53,CHELSEA OR KIM.
528,00:16:51.30,00:16:51.30,I'M ACTUALLY LEANING TOWARDS
529,00:16:52.77,00:16:52.77,TAKING TARZAN TO THE TOP THREE
530,00:16:55.60,00:16:55.60,WITH CHRISTINA AND I.
531,00:16:57.13,00:16:57.13,SO KIM BETTER COME BACK WITH THE
532,00:16:58.90,00:16:58.90,RIGHT STORY THAT WE'RE STILL
533,00:17:00.77,00:17:00.77,"STICKING TO CHELSEA, AND WHO"
534,00:17:03.20,00:17:03.20,KNOWS?
535,00:17:03.63,00:17:03.63,"AFTER CHELSEA'S GONE, YOU KNOW"
536,00:17:05.33,00:17:05.33,WHAT?
537,00:17:05.77,00:17:05.77,TARZAN HAS A GREAT POINT-- WE
538,00:17:07.13,00:17:07.13,NEED TO TAKE HIM OUT.
539,00:17:10.77,00:17:10.77,I LOVE ME SOME GRILLED
540,00:17:14.03,00:17:14.03,VEGGIE.

544,00:17:17.97,00:17:17.97,I'D BE SOMEWHERE BALLED UP
545,00:17:20.57,00:17:20.57,CRYING.
546,00:17:20.87,00:17:20.87,I'D BE TRYING TO DROWN.
547,00:17:22.03,00:17:22.03,THIS IS WHAT-- THIS IS THE
548,00:17:24.30,00:17:24.30,DETERMINING FACTOR.
549,00:17:24.90,00:17:24.90,IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE US OR
550,00:17:26.30,00:17:26.30,IT'S GOING TO BE THEM.
551,00:17:27.20,00:17:27.20,GOTCHA.

553,00:17:30.40,00:17:30.40,"SPLIT, IT DOESN'T MATTER."
554,00:17:31.80,00:17:31.80,RIGHT.
555,00:17:32.37,00:17:32.37,I DON'T THINK THEY'RE EVEN
556,00:17:33.67,00:17:33.67,QUESTIONING ME.
557,00:17:34.30,00:17:34.30,I DON'T THINK THEY EVER HAVE.
558,00:17:36.43,00:17:36.43,SOMEBODY HAS TO MAKE A BIG
559,00:17:38.30,00:17:38.30,MOVE.
560,00:17:38.73,00:17:38.73,KIM HAS AN AMAZING ABILITY TO
561,00:17:39.90,00:17:39.90,"LOOK AT YOU, ALMOST LOOK THROUGH"
562,00:17:41.43,00:17:41.43,"YOU AND SAY, ""YEAH, I'M WITH"
563,00:17:43.90,00:17:43.90,"YOU,"" AND IT'S BELIEVABLE."

572,00:17:56.80,00:17:56.80,THE LINE FOR ME A LITTLE BIT.
573,00:17:58.50,00:17:58.50,I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE OPTION
574,00:17:59.53,00:17:59.53,OF GOING WITH CHELSEA AND
575,00:18:01.53,00:18:01.53,SABRINA THAN JUST TRYING TO
576,00:18:02.83,00:18:02.83,FIGURE OUT ANY WAY POSSIBLE THAT
577,00:18:04.33,00:18:04.33,WE CAN SOMEHOW WIN THIS NEXT
578,00:18:05.80,00:18:05.80,VOTE WITH THREE VOTES.
579,00:18:07.13,00:18:07.13,WE GOTTA WIN TOMORROW.
580,00:18:26.67,00:18:26.67,"MY PLANS FOR THE DAY, THE"
581,00:18:28.93,00:18:28.93,FIRST THING I'M GOING TO DO IS
582,00:18:30.23,00:18:30.23,"FIX ME SOME COCONUT STEW, START"
583,00:18:32.77,00:18:32.77,"THE FIRE, CLEAN MY CLOTHES, WASH"
584,00:18:36.20,00:18:36.20,MY HAIR AGAIN.
585,00:18:39.27,00:18:39.27,I PREPARE TO BE DEFEATED IN SOME
586,00:18:40.67,00:18:40.67,KIND OF CONTEST LATER TODAY.
587,00:18:43.80,00:18:43.80,DEFEATED BY THE FEMININE GENDER.
588,00:18:47.80,00:18:47.80,FAILURE AMONG MEN.
589,00:18:50.00,00:18:50.00,I CAN DWRAIT MORE OF THIS.
590,00:18:52.03,00:18:52.03,"NO, I'M GOING TO COOK IT THIS"
591,00:18:53.90,00:18:53.90,"MORNING THE WAY I WANT TO, OKAY."
592,00:18:56.13,00:18:56.13,SO DON'T BOTHER ME ABOUT IT.
593,00:18:57.97,00:18:57.97,AND WHAT WAY ARE YOU COOKING
594,00:18:59.50,00:18:59.50,IT?
595,00:18:59.80,00:18:59.80,THE WAY YOU WANT TO.
596,00:19:01.23,00:19:01.23,"BUT, NO, HOW ARE YOU"
597,00:19:02.77,00:19:02.77,PREPARING IT?
598,00:19:03.10,00:19:03.10,DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
599,00:19:09.30,00:19:09.30,"SO, SO."
600,00:19:10.73,00:19:10.73,SAME BUGS THAT WERE ON YOUR
601,00:19:12.03,00:19:12.03,SKIN.
602,00:19:12.43,00:19:12.43,I'M SURE CHRISTINA WOULD BE
603,00:19:14.20,00:19:14.20,MORE THAN WILLING TO LET YOU USE
604,00:19:15.90,00:19:15.90,HERS.
605,00:19:16.17,00:19:16.17,DON'T TOUCH MY BUFF!
606,00:19:17.70,00:19:17.70,I'M CLEANING MY BUFF RIGHT NOW.
607,00:19:18.97,00:19:18.97,I'VE HAD TO ENTER BATTLES
608,00:19:20.90,00:19:20.90,WITH MY BARE HANDS.
609,00:19:21.73,00:19:21.73,"WHEN WE WENT OFF, YOU KNOW,"
610,00:19:23.47,00:19:23.47,ON THE REWARD CHALLENGE WE GOT
611,00:19:25.57,00:19:25.57,"STUFF AWAY FROM THE GAME, ALL"
612,00:19:26.50,00:19:26.50,"THE ARGUING, AND COMING BACK"
613,00:19:28.53,00:19:28.53,"HERE, THE SECOND WE WALK INTO"
614,00:19:30.20,00:19:30.20,"CAMP, THERE'S AN ARGUMENT, AND"
615,00:19:31.60,00:19:31.60,"IT'S JUST LIKE OH, WE'RE BACK IN"
616,00:19:33.63,00:19:33.63,IT AGAIN.
617,00:19:36.27,00:19:36.27,TARZAN WAS LIKE IF KIM COMES
618,00:19:39.73,00:19:39.73,"BACK SAYING A DIFFERENT TUNE,"
619,00:19:42.30,00:19:42.30,SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE GO BWHO
620,00:19:44.67,00:19:44.67,"WE SHOULD VOTE, WE KNOW HE'S A"
621,00:19:46.43,00:19:46.43,TRAITOR.
622,00:19:46.87,00:19:46.87,HE'S TRYING TO GET YOU ALL TO
623,00:19:48.50,00:19:48.50,TAKE HIM INSTEAD OF ME NOW.
624,00:19:50.27,00:19:50.27,"SEE, THIS IS INTERESTING."
625,00:19:51.20,00:19:51.20,"I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--"
626,00:19:52.80,00:19:52.80,MAYBE THIS WAS HIS PLAN TO
627,00:19:54.33,00:19:54.33,PLAY STUPID.
628,00:19:54.70,00:19:54.70,"I KNOW, I START TO--"
629,00:19:56.37,00:19:56.37,TO PLAY STUPID--
630,00:19:59.50,00:19:59.50,IF HE ENDS UP WINNING THIS
631,00:20:01.30,00:20:01.30,THING I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
632,00:20:02.80,00:20:02.80,"WORSE, IT'S LIKE THE MEN WIN IN"
633,00:20:04.43,00:20:04.43,THE END.
634,00:20:04.93,00:20:04.93,THE THOUGHT OF THAT MAKES ME
635,00:20:07.13,00:20:07.13,CRINGE.
636,00:20:07.50,00:20:07.50,I THINK THE ONLY REASON ALICIA
637,00:20:09.13,00:20:09.13,WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE
638,00:20:09.97,00:20:09.97,UP TARZAN WHO HAS APPEARED TO BE
639,00:20:11.73,00:20:11.73,ONE OF HER MINIONS IS SHE'S
640,00:20:13.87,00:20:13.87,CONVINCED HE IS NOT A MINION
641,00:20:15.47,00:20:15.47,AFTER ALL THAT HE'S THE

970,00:30:03.13,00:30:03.13,FELT I COULD PUSH FOR IT WITHOUT
971,00:30:05.03,00:30:05.03,MAKING IT REALLY OBVIOUS.
972,00:30:06.00,00:30:06.00,"YEAH, YEAH."
973,00:30:07.53,00:30:07.53,BUT THEN I START TO GET

1071,00:32:57.80,00:32:57.80,I THINK YOU'VE GOT IT NAILED.
1072,00:32:59.03,00:32:59.03,IF ALICIA WOULD THINK IT THROUGH
1073,00:33:00.60,00:33:00.60,A LITTLE BIT BETTER SHE'D SEE
1074,00:33:02.40,00:33:02.40,WHY THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR
1075,00:33:03.97,00:33:03.97,HER.
1076,00:33:04.47,00:33:04.47,EXCEPT THEY KNOW THERE'S NO WAY
1077,00:33:05.87,00:33:05.87,"FOR HER TO REALLY TRUST ME, AND"
1078,00:33:08.43,00:33:08.43,SO SHE COULD BE INFLUENCED BY
1079,00:33:10.57,00:33:10.57,KIM.
1080,00:33:11.03,00:33:11.03,HOW ABOUT IF WE END UP TAKING
1081,00:33:13.67,00:33:13.67,KIM?
1082,00:33:14.00,00:33:14.00,"IF YOU TAKE KIM, I THINK"
1083,00:33:18.53,00:33:18.53,"YOU'RE BEST BET AT WINNING, IF"
1084,00:33:20.10,00:33:20.10,YOU TAKE CHRISTINA.
1085,00:33:21.40,00:33:21.40,"I THINK KIM-- KIM'S, HER ANGELIC"

1088,00:33:29.97,00:33:29.97,FAIR TO YOU.
1089,00:33:31.13,00:33:31.13,"KIM, WITH HER ANGELIC EYES,"
1090,00:33:34.30,00:33:34.30,ACTUALLY FOOLED TROYZAN AND
1091,00:33:38.03,00:33:38.03,"JAY-BIRD, SO GOOD KNOWS, SHE"
1092,00:33:39.70,00:33:39.70,COULD PROBABLY FOOL ALICIA.
1093,00:33:40.90,00:33:40.90,HERE WE GO!
1094,00:33:42.10,00:33:42.10,PUT IT ON.
1095,00:33:43.10,00:33:43.10,I BET $5?
1096,00:33:46.07,00:33:46.07,O-M-G.
1097,00:33:48.43,00:33:48.43,THIS ISN'T OFFENSIVE TO
1098,00:33:49.80,00:33:49.80,ANYBODY IF I WORE THIS?
1099,00:33:50.73,00:33:50.73,THAT TANK TOP HAS DRIED BLOOD
1100,00:33:53.27,00:33:53.27,ON IT.
1101,00:33:53.70,00:33:53.70,ALL RIGHT.
1102,00:33:55.63,00:33:55.63,I WOULDN'T WANT WOMEN'S DIRTY
1103,00:33:58.73,00:33:58.73,PANTIES TOUCHING THE SKIN ON MY
1104,00:34:00.47,00:34:00.47,FOREHEAD.
1105,00:34:00.77,00:34:00.77,I DON'T WANT TO BLINDSIDE
1106,00:34:02.27,00:34:02.27,TARZAN TONIGHT.
1107,00:34:02.83,00:34:02.83,WE HAVE A FATHER-DAUGHTER-LIKE
1108,00:34:05.50,00:34:05.50,RELATIONSHIP.
1109,00:34:05.80,00:34:05.80,"BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HE MIGHT"
1110,00:34:07.33,00:34:07.33,REUNITE WITH SABRINA AND TAKE
1111,00:34:09.67,00:34:09.67,CHRISTINE AND PERSUADE HER.
1112,00:34:10.90,00:34:10.90,AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I WANT
1113,00:34:12.20,00:34:12.20,TO AVOID.
1114,00:34:12.97,00:34:12.97,"PLEASE, PLEASE, HOLD THE"
1115,00:34:15.77,00:34:15.77,APPLAUSE.
1116,00:34:16.07,00:34:16.07,"NO, NO, NO, NO."
1117,00:34:18.13,00:34:18.13,PLEASE.
1118,00:34:18.37,00:34:18.37,THIS IS KILLING ME.
1119,00:34:23.70,00:34:23.70,I WANT TO SAY I TRUST KIM.
1120,00:34:26.10,00:34:26.10,"I WANT TO SAY 100%, BUT THERE"
1121,00:34:27.80,00:34:27.80,"IS, LIKE, THIS DOUBT IN MY MIND"
1122,00:34:31.50,00:34:31.50,THAT MAYBE SHE'S PLAYING ME.
1123,00:34:35.73,00:34:35.73,"SO IT'S, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW."
1124,00:34:38.33,00:34:38.33,I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE DO
1125,00:34:39.87,00:34:39.87,I GO WITH?

1129,00:35:06.23,00:35:06.23,"Jeff: JONAS, MICHAEL, JAY,LEIF, TROYZAN, AND KAT, "
1130,00:35:10.30,00:35:10.30,VOTED OUT AT THE LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1133,00:35:24.13,00:35:24.13,STILL HERE.
1134,00:35:27.50,00:35:27.50,SURPRISE YOU?
1135,00:35:27.97,00:35:27.97,"NO, NOT REALLY."
1136,00:35:29.40,00:35:29.40,"YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T PUT"
1137,00:35:30.73,00:35:30.73,"YOURSELF IN THE MIX, THEN, YOU"
1138,00:35:32.50,00:35:32.50,"KNOW, YOU'VE ALREADY DEFEATED"
1139,00:35:33.80,00:35:33.80,YOURSELF FROM THE START.
1140,00:35:34.63,00:35:34.63,SO OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE
1141,00:35:36.43,00:35:36.43,YOURSELF.
1142,00:35:36.80,00:35:36.80,Jeff: STILL BELIEVE YOU CAN
1143,00:35:38.03,00:35:38.03,WIN?
1144,00:35:38.20,00:35:38.20,WHY NOT?
1145,00:35:39.97,00:35:39.97,YEAH.
1146,00:35:40.33,00:35:40.33,"Jeff: TARZAN, YOU'RE STILL"
1147,00:35:42.20,00:35:42.20,HERE.
1148,00:35:42.60,00:35:42.60,ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD I'M
1149,00:35:43.73,00:35:43.73,STILL HERE.
1150,00:35:45.57,00:35:45.57,Jeff: WHY DO YOU THINK YOU
1151,00:35:46.93,00:35:46.93,ARE STILL HERE WHEN ALL THE
1152,00:35:48.80,00:35:48.80,OTHER GUYS ARE OVER ON THE JURY?
1153,00:35:50.10,00:35:50.10,BECAUSE I HELPED THE LADIES
1154,00:35:53.47,00:35:53.47,GET RID OF THE GUYS.
1155,00:35:54.80,00:35:54.80,Jeff: BUT THAT MOMENT HAS
1156,00:35:55.93,00:35:55.93,COME AND GONE.
1157,00:35:56.50,00:35:56.50,AND MY MOMENT'S PROBABLY JUST
1158,00:35:58.37,00:35:58.37,ABOUT OVER.
1159,00:35:59.60,00:35:59.60,"BUT, YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY WANTS"
1160,00:36:00.67,00:36:00.67,"TO TAKE ME TO THE END, I'LL GO."
1161,00:36:02.47,00:36:02.47,I'M NOT STUPID.
1162,00:36:03.90,00:36:03.90,BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD TACTIC
1163,00:36:07.00,00:36:07.00,BECAUSE THESE FIVE GUYS ARE
1164,00:36:08.03,00:36:08.03,"GOING TO VOTE FOR WHAT, A"
1165,00:36:09.83,00:36:09.83,MILLIONAIRE?
1166,00:36:10.07,00:36:10.07,I DON'T THINK SO.
1167,00:36:11.33,00:36:11.33,"Jeff: SO, SABRINA, SOMEBODY"
1168,00:36:13.07,00:36:13.07,WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE HE CAN WIN
1169,00:36:14.37,00:36:14.37,AND NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO BELIEVE
1170,00:36:16.00,00:36:16.00,HE CAN WIN COULD BECOME AN
1171,00:36:18.20,00:36:18.20,ASSET.
1172,00:36:18.60,00:36:18.60,"TO A DEGREE, BUT AT THE END"
1173,00:36:20.53,00:36:20.53,"OF THE DAY, WE'RE WOMEN AND HE'S"
1174,00:36:21.97,00:36:21.97,"STILL A MAN, AND NO MATTER WHO"
1175,00:36:24.77,00:36:24.77,HE HELPED PICK OFF THERE MAY BE
1176,00:36:26.77,00:36:26.77,SOME PEOPLE ON THE JURY WHO ARE
1177,00:36:28.07,00:36:28.07,"LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT?"
1178,00:36:29.00,00:36:29.00,I DON'T WANT A WOMAN TO WIN AT
1179,00:36:30.80,00:36:30.80,ALL.
1180,00:36:31.27,00:36:31.27,"IT'S A RISK, I THINK, TO TAKE"
1181,00:36:33.37,00:36:33.37,HIM TO THE TOP.
1182,00:36:34.27,00:36:34.27,"Jeff: TARZAN, REALLY,"
1183,00:36:35.77,00:36:35.77,THERE'S VERY LITTLE ROOM TO
1184,00:36:36.87,00:36:36.87,HIDE.
1185,00:36:37.27,00:36:37.27,I THINK OUR GAME IS SOLID AT
1186,00:36:39.70,00:36:39.70,THE MOMENT.
1187,00:36:40.20,00:36:40.20,"I MEAN, THEY'VE KEPT THEIR WORD"
1188,00:36:42.57,00:36:42.57,AND ALMOST INVARIABLY THE RIGHT
1189,00:36:44.40,00:36:44.40,PERSON GOES EACH TIME.
1190,00:36:46.10,00:36:46.10,"Jeff: TARZAN, DO YOU THINK"
1191,00:36:47.47,00:36:47.47,THE JURY WOULD AGREE?
1192,00:36:48.37,00:36:48.37,"NO, IT'S HUMAN NATURE WHEN"
1193,00:36:50.00,00:36:50.00,"YOU'RE VOTED OUT, YOU'RE NOT"
1194,00:36:52.23,00:36:52.23,"INTROSPECTIVE ENOUGH TO SAY,"
1195,00:36:53.00,00:36:53.00,"""WAIT A MINUTE."
1196,00:36:53.60,00:36:53.60,THE PERSON THAT'S VOTED OUT
1197,00:36:55.37,00:36:55.37,ISN'T IN THE ALIGNMENT WHEN THE
1198,00:36:57.47,00:36:57.47,"GAME IS-- EXCUSE ME-- AFOOT."""
1199,00:37:01.87,00:37:01.87,Jeff: BUT THEY BELIEVE THEY
1200,00:37:05.27,00:37:05.27,WERE.
1201,00:37:05.60,00:37:05.60,I'LL GIVE YOU THAT POINT.
1202,00:37:06.53,00:37:06.53,"Jeff: TARZAN, DO YOU OFTEN"
1203,00:37:09.23,00:37:09.23,FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD IN THIS GAME?
1204,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,"I WOULD SAY THAT'S TRUE,"
1205,00:37:12.67,00:37:12.67,YEAH.
1206,00:37:12.97,00:37:12.97,IT'S LIKE THE DAY I WORE
1207,00:37:14.50,00:37:14.50,SOMETHING AND THEY'RE WORRIED
1208,00:37:16.20,00:37:16.20,ABOUT MICROBES AND THEY
1209,00:37:16.97,00:37:16.97,HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I KNOW ABOUT
1210,00:37:18.33,00:37:18.33,THAT AND THAT'S WHY I WASN'T
1211,00:37:20.20,00:37:20.20,WORRY BUT THEY WERE.
1212,00:37:20.97,00:37:20.97,Jeff: WHAT DID YOU WEAR?
1213,00:37:22.07,00:37:22.07,HE'S WEARING KAT'S TANK.
1214,00:37:23.87,00:37:23.87,"I'M WEARING THIS, BUT I ALSO"
1215,00:37:25.97,00:37:25.97,"PUT HER PANTIES ON MY HEAD, AND"
1216,00:37:28.07,00:37:28.07,"THEY WERE LIKE, ""OH, NO!"
1217,00:37:31.47,00:37:31.47,PANTY!
1218,00:37:31.67,00:37:31.67,"""JUST FOR A JOKE."
1219,00:37:33.23,00:37:33.23,AND I'M NOT AFRAID OF THOSE
1220,00:37:35.13,00:37:35.13,PANTIES AT ALL.
1221,00:37:36.30,00:37:36.30,"Jeff: SABRINA, THIS REALLY"
1222,00:37:37.90,00:37:37.90,"IS, ON A VERY BASE LEVEL WHAT"
1223,00:37:41.17,00:37:41.17,"""SURVIVOR"" IS ABOUT."
1224,00:37:41.90,00:37:41.90,"YOU HAVE TO DECIDE, TARZAN WANTS"
1225,00:37:43.57,00:37:43.57,"TO PUT ON KAT'S SHIRT, HE THINKS"
1226,00:37:45.87,00:37:45.87,IT'S FUNNY.
1227,00:37:47.17,00:37:47.17,HE STILL MIGHT BE THE GUY I TAKE
1228,00:37:49.43,00:37:49.43,TO THE END.
1229,00:37:50.03,00:37:50.03,THOSE ARE THE DECISION YOU
1230,00:37:51.67,00:37:51.67,WEIGH.
1231,00:37:52.07,00:37:52.07,AND WHAT I'VE BEEN WEIGHING
1232,00:37:53.97,00:37:53.97,IS COULD THIS BRILLIANT MAN WHO
1233,00:37:55.87,00:37:55.87,IS WEARING PANTIES ON HIS HEAD
1234,00:37:59.03,00:37:59.03,BE PLAYING US.
1235,00:38:01.20,00:38:01.20,"OH, I JUST WANTED TO SEE MY"
1236,00:38:03.67,00:38:03.67,WEAPON WIFE.
1237,00:38:04.17,00:38:04.17,I JUST WANT THE THE ADVENTURE.
1238,00:38:05.73,00:38:05.73,AND NOW YOU WANT TO PLAY THE
1239,00:38:07.50,00:38:07.50,GAME... YEAH.
1240,00:38:07.93,00:38:07.93,Jeff: ALICIA WHAT THE
1241,00:38:09.70,00:38:09.70,REACTION BACK TO CAMP WHEN
1242,00:38:11.13,00:38:11.13,SABRINA AND KIM WERE ASKED TO GO
1243,00:38:12.93,00:38:12.93,WITH CHELSO THE AWARD.
1244,00:38:13.93,00:38:13.93,"SHE PICKED SABRINA, WHO I"
1245,00:38:15.67,00:38:15.67,"THOUGHT WAS A FAIR CHOICE,"
1246,00:38:18.10,00:38:18.10,DEFINITELY.
1247,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,"HOWEVER, WAS KIM A FAIR CHOICE,"
1248,00:38:19.90,00:38:19.90,WHEN THESE TWO HAVE NOT BEEN ON
1249,00:38:21.87,00:38:21.87,ANY REWARDS IN A WHILE?
1250,00:38:23.30,00:38:23.30,"I MEAN, THAT'S KIND OF UP TO THE"
1251,00:38:25.23,00:38:25.23,PERSON WHO IS PICKING.
1252,00:38:26.43,00:38:26.43,KAT PICKED TWO PEOPLE THAT SHE
1253,00:38:28.43,00:38:28.43,LIKED --
1254,00:38:28.73,00:38:28.73,AND SHE WAS VOTED OUT.
1255,00:38:29.80,00:38:29.80,RIGHT.
1256,00:38:33.13,00:38:33.13,"Jeff: KRISTINA, FRUSTRATED"
1257,00:38:34.47,00:38:34.47,THAT CHELSEA DIDN'T PICK YOU?
1258,00:38:35.67,00:38:35.67,"YEAH, THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT"
1259,00:38:36.93,00:38:36.93,OF FRUSTRATION AND STUFF.
1260,00:38:38.70,00:38:38.70,THERE WAS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN
1261,00:38:39.97,00:38:39.97,"CHELS AND I, AND WE MADE AN"
1262,00:38:41.93,00:38:41.93,"AGREEMENT THAT, LIKE, WE WOULD"
1263,00:38:43.43,00:38:43.43,TAKE EACH OTHER.
1264,00:38:44.07,00:38:44.07,SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT
1265,00:38:45.77,00:38:45.77,DISAPPOINTED.
1266,00:38:46.23,00:38:46.23,BUT --
1267,00:38:46.60,00:38:46.60,SO YOU FEEL LIKE SHE BROKE
1268,00:38:47.80,00:38:47.80,HER WORD TO YOU.
1269,00:38:48.70,00:38:48.70,"YES, I DID."
1270,00:38:50.93,00:38:50.93,SHE ALSO BROKE HER WORD TO ME
1271,00:38:53.20,00:38:53.20,RIGHT AFTER THAT CONVERSATION
1272,00:38:54.13,00:38:54.13,WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T TAKE HER.
1273,00:38:56.77,00:38:56.77,Jeff: SO WHAT WILL SAVE YOU
1274,00:38:58.23,00:38:58.23,TONIGHT?
