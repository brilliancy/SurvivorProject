599,00:30:13.40,00:30:13.40,"KELLY, JEFF VARNER, BUT, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT"
600,00:30:17.10,00:30:17.10,ABI STILL FEELS GOOD.
601,00:30:18.77,00:30:18.77,SHE IS ALWAYS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
602,00:30:25.60,00:30:25.60,>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?
603,00:30:27.00,00:30:27.00,>> I FEEL GOOD.
604,00:30:28.13,00:30:28.13,I FEEL GOOD TODAY.
605,00:30:28.83,00:30:28.83,>> I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.
606,00:30:32.97,00:30:32.97,I'M SORRY I DIDN'T STAND UP FOR YOU.
607,00:30:34.97,00:30:34.97,">> I WISH YOU HAD BECAUSE I'M A LOYAL PERSON, AND WHEN I GIVE MY"

609,00:30:42.40,00:30:42.40,I WAS EXPECTING ONE OF YOU GUYS TO AT LEAST COME AND CHECK ON
610,00:30:46.20,00:30:46.20,ME.
611,00:30:46.70,00:30:46.70,WHO CAME?
612,00:30:49.50,00:30:49.50,TERRY.
613,00:30:53.93,00:30:53.93,TERRY CAME.
614,00:30:54.53,00:30:54.53,"HE SPENT TWO HOURS WITH ME, TWO HOURS."
615,00:31:00.40,00:31:00.40,I'M SO SORRY.
616,00:31:01.37,00:31:01.37,"I TRIED, SHIRIN."
617,00:31:02.93,00:31:02.93,I TRIED.
618,00:31:03.60,00:31:03.60,"I TRIED HAVING YOUR BACK, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WITH ME YOU'RE"
619,00:31:08.03,00:31:08.03,DEAD.
620,00:31:08.60,00:31:08.60,YOU GUYS LEFT ME THERE ALL BY MYSELF.
621,00:31:10.77,00:31:10.77,">> ABI, I GAVE YOU MY WORD."
622,00:31:13.33,00:31:13.33,I VOTED WITH YOU?
623,00:31:15.40,00:31:15.40,WHAT MORE CAN I DO.
624,00:31:16.07,00:31:16.07,>> I WAS CRYING IN FRONT OF YOU.
625,00:31:17.97,00:31:17.97,I WAS MADE A FOOL OF.
626,00:31:20.07,00:31:20.07,OKAY.
627,00:31:20.43,00:31:20.43,THIS IS REALLY AWKWARD.
628,00:31:21.93,00:31:21.93,>> VARNER IS ON BOARD.
629,00:31:23.83,00:31:23.83,KELLY IS ON BOARD.
630,00:31:24.43,00:31:24.43,>> THEY WANT TO VOTE YOU AND SPENCER OUT.
631,00:31:27.93,00:31:27.93,>> ARE WE STILL IN THIS TOGETHER?
632,00:31:36.77,00:31:36.77,>> NOT MY STYLE.
633,00:31:41.37,00:31:41.37,>> SPENCER AND I WERE IN THE MAJORITY THAT VOTED OUT VYTAS.
634,00:31:45.60,00:31:45.60,"WE SHOULD BE RIDING HIGH, HAPPY, BUT SOMEHOW SOME WAY WE'VE ENDED"
635,00:31:50.73,00:31:50.73,UP IN THE MINORITY.
636,00:31:56.83,00:31:56.83,WE'RE SCREWED.
637,00:31:58.43,00:31:58.43,>> OKAY.
638,00:31:58.97,00:31:58.97,CAN YOU EXPLAIN...
639,00:31:59.97,00:31:59.97,">> LOOK, I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TIME TO MINCE WORDS HERE."
640,00:32:04.53,00:32:04.53,VARNER AND ABI ARE GOING TO VOTE WITH OLD SCHOOL.
641,00:32:06.97,00:32:06.97,>> RIGHT NOW I'M SWINGING LIKE A PENDULUM BETWEEN FRUSTRATION AND
642,00:32:11.50,00:32:11.50,EXASPERATION.
643,00:32:12.20,00:32:12.20,"ONE MINUTE AGO I WAS IN A PERFECTLY FINE POSITION, AND NOW"
644,00:32:16.23,00:32:16.23,NOTHING IS NEARLY AS HIGH A PRIORITY AS KEEPING MYSELF SAFE.
645,00:32:20.50,00:32:20.50,I JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO MAKE IT THREE MORE
646,00:32:25.20,00:32:25.20,DAYS.
647,00:32:30.03,00:32:30.03,>> I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
648,00:32:31.83,00:32:31.83,"HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU, IF IT'S ALL OLD SCHOOL, YOU,"
649,00:32:34.70,00:32:34.70,"THEY'LL KEEP YOU AROUND FOR CHALLENGES FOR NOW, BUT YOU WILL"
650,00:32:37.00,00:32:37.00,"BE AT THE BOTTOM, AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE MERGE,"
651,00:32:40.23,00:32:40.23,YOU WILL BE THE BIGGEST THREAT AND YOU WILL BE PICKED OFF AS
652,00:32:43.40,00:32:43.40,SOON AS YOU DON'T WIN IMMUNITY.
653,00:32:45.17,00:32:45.17,>> ALL OF A SUDDEN SPENCER AND SHIRIN HAVE THE AUDACITY TO
654,00:32:49.30,00:32:49.30,"THINK, YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M GOING TO DROP MY TRIBE, JUMP IN WITH"
655,00:32:52.33,00:32:52.33,THEM.
656,00:32:52.93,00:32:52.93,"HEY, I'M SORRY, MAJORITY RULES."
657,00:32:55.77,00:32:55.77,LIKE I'M IN THE SAYING I DON'T TRUST YOU...
658,00:32:57.07,00:32:57.07,>> YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
659,00:32:58.63,00:32:58.63,>> THIS IS THE FIRST CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING WITH
660,00:33:01.17,00:33:01.17,ME.
661,00:33:01.67,00:33:01.67,YOU'RE THROWING A LOT AT ME.
662,00:33:02.60,00:33:02.60,>> I NEVER BREAK MY WORD.
663,00:33:04.27,00:33:04.27,"I FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH ABOUT THE FACT THAT I VERY, VERY WELL"
664,00:33:09.00,00:33:09.00,MAY GO HOME.
665,00:33:11.13,00:33:11.13,THE ONLY OPTION I HAVE IS VOTING FOR SPENCER.
666,00:33:14.30,00:33:14.30,I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR SPENCER.
667,00:33:16.67,00:33:16.67,I WILL MAKE YOU ANY DEAL YOU WANT RIGHT NOW.
668,00:33:18.70,00:33:18.70,>> IT BOGGLES MY MIND THAT NOT ONE TIME DID YOU EVER PULL ME
669,00:33:23.30,00:33:23.30,ASIDE.
670,00:33:23.63,00:33:23.63,NOW YOU COME TO ME ASKING ME FOR A VOTE.
671,00:33:27.73,00:33:27.73,"I'M JUST KIND OF SITTING BACK LIKE, ABSOLUTELY NOT."
672,00:33:35.47,00:33:35.47,MY SITUATION IS GETTING WEAKER AND BLEECKER.
673,00:33:37.90,00:33:37.90,THIS WAS GOING TO BE MY SECOND CHANCE.
674,00:33:39.63,00:33:39.63,"I WANTED TO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE, BUT I'M"
675,00:33:42.90,00:33:42.90,BEING BROUGHT HARD BACK TO MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WHERE
676,00:33:46.60,00:33:46.60,EVERYTHING STARTS GOING REALLY WELL AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT
677,00:33:49.90,00:33:49.90,COLLAPSES IN FRONT OF ME.
678,00:33:53.33,00:33:53.33,EVERY SINGLE PERSON OTHER THAN SHIRIN AND I IS IN THE NUMBERS
679,00:33:57.73,00:33:57.73,AGAINST US.
680,00:33:59.47,00:33:59.47,"I MEAN, SHIRIN'S BEEN MY ONLY SOLID PERSON, AND NOW I FEEL"
681,00:34:04.73,00:34:04.73,LIKE THERE'S NO MOVE I CAN MAKE OTHER THAN SCREWING OVER THE ONE
682,00:34:09.70,00:34:09.70,PERSON I WANTED TO PLAY WITH.
683,00:34:45.90,00:34:45.90,">> Jeff: SO, VARNER, WHAT IS THE VIBE OF THE TRIBE RIGHT NOW?"
684,00:34:50.13,00:34:50.13,>> I THINK WE'RE ALL EXHAUSTED.
685,00:34:52.07,00:34:52.07,I THINK TODAY REALLY SUCKED A LOT OUT OF US.
686,00:34:55.03,00:34:55.03,THAT WAS AN INTENSE CHALLENGE.
687,00:34:58.37,00:34:58.37,">> Jeff: SPENCER, IT'S ONE THING TO WANT THE PLAY AGAIN,"
688,00:35:00.80,00:35:00.80,"BUT THEN YOU GET OUT HERE AND YOU'RE REMINDED, OH, YEAH, THIS"
689,00:35:04.60,00:35:04.60,IS AN ASS-KICKER.
690,00:35:06.33,00:35:06.33,">> YEAH, I THINK WE DEAL WITH SOME KIND OF AMNESIA FOR HOWEVER"
691,00:35:11.03,00:35:11.03,MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN SINCE WE PLAYED THE FIRST TIME.
692,00:35:13.00,00:35:13.00,"THEN WE GET BACK HERE AND IT'S LIKE, OH, THIS SUCKS."
693,00:35:15.80,00:35:15.80,IT'S GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS.
694,00:35:20.37,00:35:20.37,">> Jeff: SHIRIN, IT'S INTERESTING WHAT SPENCER JUST"
695,00:35:23.67,00:35:23.67,SAID.
696,00:35:24.47,00:35:24.47,"YOU REMEMBER ""SURVIVOR"" BEING AWESOME UNTIL YOU GET BACK OUT"
697,00:35:27.53,00:35:27.53,HERE.
698,00:35:27.73,00:35:27.73,>> I DON'T REMEMBER IT AS BEING AWESOME.
699,00:35:29.67,00:35:29.67,"I HAD A REALLY ROUGH TIME FIRST TIME AROUND, AND I'M STARTING TO"
700,00:35:33.27,00:35:33.27,HAVE A ROUGH TIME THE SECOND TIME AROUND.
701,00:35:35.57,00:35:35.57,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT?
702,00:35:36.90,00:35:36.90,">> YEAH, ALREADY."
703,00:35:38.50,00:35:38.50,>> Jeff: TELL ME ABOUT THAT.
704,00:35:40.50,00:35:40.50,>> THERE WAS SOME FIGHTING AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE LOST SOME TRUST
705,00:35:43.80,00:35:43.80,IN ME.
706,00:35:44.57,00:35:44.57,I THINK I'M ON THE BOTTOM.
707,00:35:46.10,00:35:46.10,I HOPE I CAN FIGHT MY WAY BACK INTO THE GAME.
708,00:35:48.53,00:35:48.53,">> Jeff: KELLEY, WHAT IS SHIRIN REFERRING TO?"
709,00:35:53.17,00:35:53.17,">> THERE WAS A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN ABI AND PEIH-GEE, AND I"
710,00:35:57.73,00:35:57.73,THINK THAT'S WHAT SHIRIN IS TALKING ABOUT.
711,00:35:59.83,00:35:59.83,">> Jeff: ABI, WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?"
712,00:36:01.83,00:36:01.83,>> I WAS SITTING AT THE BEACH AND PEIH-GEE AND SHIRIN WERE
713,00:36:06.23,00:36:06.23,TALKING ABOUT ME.
714,00:36:06.97,00:36:06.97,I FELT BETRAYED IN A WAY BECAUSE WE WERE ALL IN AN ALLIANCE.
715,00:36:10.70,00:36:10.70,"AND I AM VERY, VERY GRACIOUS TOWARD TERRY."
716,00:36:14.43,00:36:14.43,HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT RESCUED ME WHEN I WAS FEELING VERY
717,00:36:19.23,00:36:19.23,"LONELY, WHEN I FELT THAT I WAS GOING TO BE VOTED OUT TONIGHT"
718,00:36:23.87,00:36:23.87,UNANIMOUSLY.
719,00:36:24.33,00:36:24.33,">> Jeff: SHIRIN, THAT'S ALMOST VERBATIM WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR"
720,00:36:27.87,00:36:27.87,SEASON.
721,00:36:28.27,00:36:28.27,"YOU SAID IT ABOUT MIKE, THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO RESCUED ME."
722,00:36:31.90,00:36:31.90,"ABI SAID IT ABOUT TERRY, BUT IN THIS CASE, SHE WAS UPSET WITH"
723,00:36:35.33,00:36:35.33,YOU.
724,00:36:35.57,00:36:35.57,>> I AGREE THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR HER.
725,00:36:37.87,00:36:37.87,I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO HER RIGHT AWAY AND FIXED IT.
726,00:36:40.40,00:36:40.40,I DIDN'T.
727,00:36:42.73,00:36:42.73,AND THE GAME CHANGES VERY QUICKLY.
728,00:36:46.00,00:36:46.00,">> Jeff: DIETZ, YOU'RE NODDING YOUR HEAD."
729,00:36:47.90,00:36:47.90,">> YEAH, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS ON THE BOTTOM A COUPLE DAYS AGO,"
730,00:36:51.73,00:36:51.73,"AND BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT, IT ENDED UP WITH"
731,00:36:54.73,00:36:54.73,"ABI SITTING ON THE BEACH, AND SHE AND I JUST MADE A"
732,00:36:57.53,00:36:57.53,CONNECTION.
733,00:36:57.83,00:36:57.83,"YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T THIS HARD-CORE STRATEGY THING."
734,00:37:00.70,00:37:00.70,"IT WAS JUST ABOUT BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP, AND A LOT OF GOOD"
735,00:37:03.57,00:37:03.57,THINGS CAME OUT OF IT.
736,00:37:04.57,00:37:04.57,>> Jeff: TO THE POINT WHERE I DON'T THINK I'M ON THE BOTTOM
737,00:37:09.20,00:37:09.20,ANYMORE.
738,00:37:09.43,00:37:09.43,">> Jeff: SPENCER, SHIRIN SAYS SHE FEELS SO ON THE BOTTOM."
739,00:37:13.13,00:37:13.13,IS THAT A CONSENSUS THAT SHE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE?
740,00:37:15.67,00:37:15.67,>> YEAH.
741,00:37:16.53,00:37:16.53,"I MEAN, I DON'T SEE ANY REASON TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, BUT I"
742,00:37:20.50,00:37:20.50,AM ALSO CONCERNED.
743,00:37:21.77,00:37:21.77,>> Jeff: WHY WOULD YOU BE A TARGET TONIGHT?
744,00:37:24.20,00:37:24.20,">> THERE ARE A LOT OF REASON, BUT ONE IS TALKING TOO MUCH"
745,00:37:27.87,00:37:27.87,ABOUT STRATEGY AND TOO LITTLE ABOUT GETTING TO KNOW ALL OF
746,00:37:30.23,00:37:30.23,THESE PEOPLE.
747,00:37:31.37,00:37:31.37,">> Jeff: JEFF, ARE SHIRIN AND SPENCER RIGHT TO BE CONCERNED?"
748,00:37:35.83,00:37:35.83,HAVE YOU GUYS NARROWED IT DOWN TO ONE OF THOSE TWO GOING?
749,00:37:38.57,00:37:38.57,>> YES.
750,00:37:41.20,00:37:41.20,">> Jeff: SPENCER, THAT CONFIRMS THAT."
751,00:37:42.63,00:37:42.63,>> 100%.
752,00:37:43.80,00:37:43.80,I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO SPEAK ABOUT IT IN CODE.
753,00:37:47.03,00:37:47.03,"IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF US GOING HOME, BUT I'M TELLING YOU,"
754,00:37:50.50,00:37:50.50,"WIGLESWORTH, TERRY, PEIH-GEE, JEFF, ABI, WOO AND KELLY, IF I"
755,00:37:56.77,00:37:56.77,"AM HERE TOMORROW, THIS CHANGE WILL HAPPEN."
756,00:37:58.23,00:37:58.23,"IT'S NOT ABOUT FORMING AN ALLIANCE HERE, I'M FORMING AN"
757,00:38:01.90,00:38:01.90,"ALLIANCE HERE, IT'S ABOUT CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE."
758,00:38:05.60,00:38:05.60,"IT'S ABOUT FORMING RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE A BASIS, AND THAT'S"
759,00:38:08.63,00:38:08.63,"WHAT I'M HERE TO DO FROM HERE ON OUT, AND I MEAN THAT."
760,00:38:11.37,00:38:11.37,">> Jeff: IT IS AMAZING, THE TWO PEOPLE IN TROUBLE TONIGHT,"
761,00:38:15.60,00:38:15.60,"SHIRIN AND SPENCER, ARE HAVING VERY SIMILAR STORIES TO THE"
762,00:38:18.47,00:38:18.47,FIRST TIME YOU BOTH PLAYED.
763,00:38:20.10,00:38:20.10,"SPENCER, THAT WAS ALMOST THE SPEECH YOU GAVE YOUR SEASON."
764,00:38:22.97,00:38:22.97,"I'LL JUST WORK WITH ANYBODY WHO WILL GIVE WITH ME, JUST GIVE ME"
765,00:38:25.70,00:38:25.70,A CHANCE.
766,00:38:26.63,00:38:26.63,AND SHIRIN YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT
767,00:38:29.53,00:38:29.53,BEING EXCLUDED ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.
768,00:38:31.60,00:38:31.60,"WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT, SHIRIN?"
769,00:38:33.60,00:38:33.60,WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT SECOND CHANCES AND THE ABILITY TO
770,00:38:35.80,00:38:35.80,CHANGE OR THE SITUATION THAT WE END UP PUTTING OURSELVES IN TIME
771,00:38:39.30,00:38:39.30,AFTER TIME AFTER TIME?
772,00:38:40.23,00:38:40.23,>> CHANGE IS HARD.
773,00:38:42.33,00:38:42.33,THIS IS A SECOND CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO CHIP AWAY AT IT.
774,00:38:45.57,00:38:45.57,IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE OVERNIGHT.
775,00:38:48.47,00:38:48.47,I MADE SOME VERY CLEAR MISTAKES.
776,00:38:50.77,00:38:50.77,"SO IF I GO HOME TONIGHT, THAT'S ON ME."
777,00:38:53.93,00:38:53.93,I DID THAT.
778,00:38:55.27,00:38:55.27,"IF I DON'T GO HOME TONIGHT, IF I STAY, THAT'S A THIRD CHANCE."
779,00:39:01.67,00:39:01.67,THAT'S ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME.
780,00:39:05.70,00:39:05.70,>> Jeff: ALL RIGHT.
781,00:39:06.13,00:39:06.13,IT IS TIME TO VOTE.
782,00:39:08.37,00:39:08.37,"WIGLESWORTH, YOU'RE UP."
783,00:39:38.87,00:39:38.87,">> I KNOW YOU'RE WRITING MY NAME DOWN, TOO."
784,00:39:41.53,00:39:41.53,I DON'T HAVE A BAD THING TO SAY ABOUT YOU.
785,00:39:57.60,00:39:57.60,>> Anchor: I'LL GO TALLY THE VOTES.
786,00:40:11.27,00:40:11.27,"IF ANYBODY HAS A HIDDEN IMMUNITY IDOL AND YOU WANT THE PLAY IT,"
787,00:40:13.50,00:40:13.50,NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO DO SO.
