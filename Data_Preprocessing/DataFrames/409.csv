2,00:00:05.03,00:00:05.03,castaways were marooned in the middle of one of the most remote

4,00:00:12.57,00:00:12.57,islands. The eight remaining members of
5,00:00:14.67,00:00:14.67,"the Soliantu tribe have now made it past the halfway point, each"
6,00:00:17.83,00:00:17.83,one now has a one in eight chance of winning a million
7,00:00:20.47,00:00:20.47,"dollars. Tonight, in a special edition of"
8,00:00:24.03,00:00:24.03,"highlights and never-before-seen footage, we'll take a closer"
9,00:00:28.57,00:00:28.57,look at their adventure thus far.

11,00:00:34.70,00:00:34.70,going to put the other team's name on it and start jabbing the
12,00:00:37.80,00:00:37.80,hell out of it. >> (singing in Spanish)
13,00:00:42.43,00:00:42.43,">> These three new members brought, I guess, a sense humor"
14,00:00:45.77,00:00:45.77,"that I don't think we had before, and it was fun."
15,00:00:48.63,00:00:48.63,">> We wanted a word that we can shout out when we win, and"
16,00:00:52.37,00:00:52.37,sounds good. >> Today is the last day we will
17,00:00:58.50,00:00:58.50,ever get a fair chance. >> If we make a pact that we're
18,00:01:01.80,00:01:01.80,"going to go in firestorm... Obviously, when Paschal and"
19,00:01:04.43,00:01:04.43,"Neleh started to see what I've been talking about all along,"
20,00:01:07.27,00:01:07.27,so now the new agreement we have is that we're going to vote John
21,00:01:10.67,00:01:10.67,out tonight. >> PROBST: Day 1 found 16
22,00:02:24.47,00:02:24.47,strangers marooned thousands of miles from the nearest
23,00:02:28.17,00:02:28.17,"continent. As two separate tribes, Maraamu"
24,00:02:30.93,00:02:30.93,"and Rotu, they found themselves paddling the rough waters of the"
25,00:02:35.10,00:02:35.10,"South Pacific, looking for their camps."
26,00:02:37.63,00:02:37.63,"But for some, the journey was nothing like they expected."
27,00:02:48.03,00:02:48.03,">> If we see the flag, then we'll just go right."
28,00:02:50.43,00:02:50.43,>> We got to go around that little jutty thing there.
29,00:02:53.10,00:02:53.10,>> When we first jumped off the boat there was definitely a lot
30,00:02:55.67,00:02:55.67,of excitement going through everybody's head.
31,00:02:57.53,00:02:57.53,"In the beginning it's all fun, and then you're paddling for"
32,00:03:01.87,00:03:01.87,"about ten, 15 minutes, and reality sets in."
33,00:03:04.40,00:03:04.40,It hits you that there's nobody here to help you.
34,00:03:07.93,00:03:07.93,The fact of the matter is you really have to get there.
35,00:03:11.03,00:03:11.03,>> Which way we going? Left? >> Yeah.
36,00:03:12.63,00:03:12.63,>> It looks like a beach in there.
37,00:03:14.10,00:03:14.10,">> Rocky beach, though. Rocky beach."
38,00:03:16.93,00:03:16.93,Take it out. Look at it.
39,00:03:18.00,00:03:18.00,It's a rocky beach. >> It looked like according to
40,00:03:20.33,00:03:20.33,"the map it would take us maybe 15, 20 minutes, if we were"
41,00:03:22.97,00:03:22.97,lucky. But then once we saw the points
42,00:03:24.80,00:03:24.80,"of where we were actually going ahead of us, that was an insane"
43,00:03:27.90,00:03:27.90,distance. It was very scary.
44,00:03:29.57,00:03:29.57,>> PROBST: The Maraamu tribe's arrival was nothing short of
45,00:03:33.50,00:03:33.50,majestic. >> Sarah's arrival was almost
46,00:03:37.80,00:03:37.80,like Cleopatra. It was like the servants are
47,00:03:41.47,00:03:41.47,"paddling and lifting, and she's sitting on the crate, looking so"
48,00:03:46.73,00:03:46.73,marvelous with her boobs hanging out and her Goldielocks in the
49,00:03:51.50,00:03:51.50,air. >> Land ho!
50,00:03:57.07,00:03:57.07,"Save it. You know, this is Survivor."
51,00:03:58.37,00:03:58.37,Ain't nobody trying to look at you like that here.
52,00:04:00.27,00:04:00.27,>> Home sweet home. >> PROBST: Rotu's arrival was a
53,00:04:07.83,00:04:07.83,joyous one. >> Woo!
54,00:04:09.47,00:04:09.47,We made it! >> PROBST: Until they discovered
55,00:04:13.50,00:04:13.50,that their crate held a minimal amount of supplies.
56,00:04:18.07,00:04:18.07,>> Yeah! >> Yeah!
57,00:04:21.83,00:04:21.83,"Oh, it's not as much as we thought!"
58,00:04:24.13,00:04:24.13,>> The stuff that was in the crate: we got a map to our spot.
59,00:04:28.17,00:04:28.17,"We got two pots and a pan, two machetes and a small knife and"
60,00:04:32.23,00:04:32.23,then a magnifying glass. >> PROBST: And starting a fire
61,00:04:35.93,00:04:35.93,became an exercise in futility. >> It's working.
62,00:04:48.17,00:04:48.17,">> PROBST: But at Maraamu, it was a different story."
63,00:04:52.57,00:04:52.57,">> People know that I'm into yoga, and in yoga you breathe"
64,00:04:55.57,00:04:55.57,"from the diaphragm, so I was able to take nice, long deep"
65,00:04:58.53,00:04:58.53,breaths. >> PROBST: Using Peter's
66,00:05:01.23,00:05:01.23,"breathing technique, Maraamu quickly had fire."
67,00:05:08.10,00:05:08.10,>> Woo-hoo! >> Keep it going.
68,00:05:11.03,00:05:11.03,"Keep it going. >> As night fell on Maraamu, Rob"
69,00:05:15.00,00:05:15.00,and Sarah were immediately drawn to one another.
70,00:05:18.37,00:05:18.37,">> Is it comfy? >> Oh, yeah, it's like a"
71,00:05:21.53,00:05:21.53,"waterbed. >> Oh, cool."
72,00:05:23.37,00:05:23.37,">> Dude, I could go to sleep right now."
73,00:05:26.67,00:05:26.67,>> Last night there was definitely flirtation around Rob
74,00:05:29.33,00:05:29.33,and Sarah. >> We fill this thing up and let
75,00:05:31.37,00:05:31.37,it cook in the sun all day tomorrow.
76,00:05:33.07,00:05:33.07,>> There you go. >> We get a hot tub.
77,00:05:34.93,00:05:34.93,>> That's an idea. >> They got into the raft that
78,00:05:37.57,00:05:37.57,"we had paddled in on, and they kind just hung out away"
79,00:05:40.57,00:05:40.57,"from everybody else, and, you know, were there pretty much the"
80,00:05:44.10,00:05:44.10,"whole entire night. So at that point, I'm now, that"
81,00:05:46.73,00:05:46.73,"was another, you know, question. Well, what are they saying, you"
82,00:05:49.93,00:05:49.93,"know, are they flirting or are they making an alliance?"
83,00:05:54.93,00:05:54.93,">> PROBST: As the sun rose on the morning of Day 2, Kathy"
84,00:05:58.67,00:05:58.67,was still determined to start a fire.
85,00:06:01.13,00:06:01.13,>> This is the most important thing right now.
86,00:06:03.87,00:06:03.87,So we need to get a group dynamic.
87,00:06:05.87,00:06:05.87,">> How many hours I spent yesterday, I'm wiped."
88,00:06:08.70,00:06:08.70,>> How many hours did you spend yesterday?
89,00:06:11.20,00:06:11.20,>> You tell me. >> Not many.
90,00:06:12.90,00:06:12.90,I don't think we spent more than two.
91,00:06:14.47,00:06:14.47,">> PROBST: John, for the sake of tribal harmony, decided to work"
92,00:06:17.23,00:06:17.23,on the fire himself. >> That's nice.
93,00:06:23.63,00:06:23.63,>> Yes! >> We got fire!
94,00:06:26.73,00:06:26.73,>> Fire! >> Yeah!
95,00:06:30.97,00:06:30.97,>> PROBST: The tribes received their first tree mail.
96,00:06:33.30,00:06:33.30,">> Oh, no, we're on the water! >> PROBST: And Rotu planned on"
97,00:06:39.40,00:06:39.40,sticking it to Maraamu in the first immunity challenge.
98,00:06:41.97,00:06:41.97,">> This was my luxury item, a voodoo doll."
99,00:06:44.53,00:06:44.53,So we're going to put the other team's name on it and start
100,00:06:48.20,00:06:48.20,jabbing the hell out of it. Pass it around.
101,00:06:50.77,00:06:50.77,Everybody gets a shot. >> I'll get their swimming feet.
102,00:06:53.53,00:06:53.53,>> I'm going for the shoulder in case we're rowing.
103,00:06:55.93,00:06:55.93,>> It won't go in his head. >> I'll stick it in the arm and
104,00:06:59.53,00:06:59.53,hopefully their arm will be sore.
105,00:07:06.93,00:07:06.93,">> PROBST: At the challenge, the tribes were told they would be"
106,00:07:09.63,00:07:09.63,"entirely on their own. In addition to no food, no"
107,00:07:12.23,00:07:12.23,"water, you're getting no fire help from us at all, of any kind"
108,00:07:15.97,00:07:15.97,at any time. Survivors ready?!
109,00:07:19.27,00:07:19.27,Go! >> Woo!
110,00:07:31.10,00:07:31.10,>> Yeah! >> PROBST: Rotu easily won.
111,00:07:36.70,00:07:36.70,"And on Day 3, the game became a harsh reality, as Maraamu"
112,00:07:40.50,00:07:40.50,realized they had to vote out one of their own.
113,00:07:43.67,00:07:43.67,>> My strategy is to keep the strong as strong as possible.
114,00:07:47.63,00:07:47.63,>> Peter got on our nerves a little bit this morning because
115,00:07:50.57,00:07:50.57,he came up and called us all over and wanted us to talk about
116,00:07:53.60,00:07:53.60,what the strategy of the game was and how he was going to do
117,00:07:56.57,00:07:56.57,it. >> I'm not this magical mystical
118,00:07:59.10,00:07:59.10,"person, all right. >> Mm-hmm."
119,00:08:01.20,00:08:01.20,">> I think if you want to get the truth on the situation,"
120,00:08:04.93,00:08:04.93,"right, you just can look in someone's eyes."
121,00:08:07.30,00:08:07.30,"That's not like, ""Ooh."" >> Some people are going to look"
122,00:08:10.47,00:08:10.47,"you in the eye and lie to you, though."
123,00:08:12.83,00:08:12.83,>> I know you don't have an alliance.
124,00:08:15.33,00:08:15.33,">> I mean, an alliance right now means absolutely nothing."
125,00:08:19.30,00:08:19.30,>> I don't know that. >> There is no alliance here.
126,00:08:21.90,00:08:21.90,>> I don't know that. >> Right now the game has
127,00:08:24.77,00:08:24.77,shifted from survival to a paranoia state.
128,00:08:27.63,00:08:27.63,I believe that Peter has taken it to the extreme.
129,00:08:31.87,00:08:31.87,">> I can see the faces, and I know the, you know, I know the"
130,00:08:36.10,00:08:36.10,outcome of tonight's vote. >> You don't know what you're
131,00:08:39.17,00:08:39.17,talking about. From based on what people are
132,00:08:40.93,00:08:40.93,looking? People are tired.
133,00:08:41.97,00:08:41.97,People are hungry. >> It's better for me to talk
134,00:08:44.20,00:08:44.20,about it because I won't be able to talk to you tonight.
135,00:08:53.80,00:08:53.80,">> PROBST: Even though Patricia and Sarah received votes,"
136,00:08:56.43,00:08:56.43,Peter's instincts were correct. He was the first person voted
137,00:09:00.50,00:09:00.50,out. First person voted out of the
138,00:09:02.90,00:09:02.90,tribe: Peter. The tribe has spoken.
139,00:09:13.30,00:09:13.30,"On Day 4, the mood at Maraamu was upbeat."
140,00:09:16.70,00:09:16.70,The tribe awoke to Sean's radio program.
141,00:09:19.67,00:09:19.67,">> You got today's weather report, Hunter?"
142,00:09:21.50,00:09:21.50,Hold on. Let me change the station.
143,00:09:23.80,00:09:23.80,>> Hunter Ellis with today's morning weather!
144,00:09:33.67,00:09:33.67,>> PROBST: At Rotu it was all work and no play.
145,00:09:38.00,00:09:38.00,Until Kathy found food. (whistling)
146,00:09:40.30,00:09:40.30,">> Hey, you guys, get over here! I'm serious!"
147,00:09:43.80,00:09:43.80,">> We got seven. One, two, three, four."
148,00:09:51.00,00:09:51.00,">> Whoa, that was slimy. >> I know, but a lot of meat"
149,00:09:53.57,00:09:53.57,here. A lot of protein we're looking
150,00:09:54.90,00:09:54.90,at. >> PROBST: And to flavor up
151,00:09:56.57,00:09:56.57,"their meal, Gabe added some spice to the mix."
152,00:09:59.07,00:09:59.07,>> These are peppers. >> Peppers!
153,00:10:01.37,00:10:01.37,">> Way to go, guys. >> Way to go, guys."
154,00:10:05.23,00:10:05.23,">> Ah! >> Coconut, lime and peppers."
155,00:10:19.40,00:10:19.40,>> Put in some more peppers. >> That looks yummy.
156,00:10:26.63,00:10:26.63,">> Wow! Wow! God, that's good."
157,00:10:37.73,00:10:37.73,">> PROBST: Back at Maraamu, Rob was trying out some inventive"
158,00:10:40.97,00:10:40.97,cooking of his own. >> I'm going to fry up a little
159,00:10:43.83,00:10:43.83,papaya. I have no idea how this is going
160,00:10:50.07,00:10:50.07,to turn out. >> I'm not going to eat it until
161,00:10:54.93,00:10:54.93,you eat it. It's your concoction.
162,00:11:00.07,00:11:00.07,>> It's pretty good. It tastes like...
163,00:11:04.37,00:11:04.37,warm papaya. >> What do you think?
164,00:11:11.13,00:11:11.13,>> PROBST: But Patricia wanted to get the chores done.
165,00:11:13.73,00:11:13.73,>> Here's the plan: you all get ready and go gather some
166,00:11:16.23,00:11:16.23,"coconuts, and we're going to finish getting these flat rocks."
167,00:11:19.00,00:11:19.00,>> How can we get coconuts without a stick?
168,00:11:20.80,00:11:20.80,">> Well, he'll get you a stick. He's a great stick hunter."
169,00:11:23.53,00:11:23.53,>> Work needs to get done and if somebody is not going to step up
170,00:11:27.07,00:11:27.07,"to the plate, I don't mind telling somebody, ""Look, let's"
171,00:11:30.10,00:11:30.10,"go."" >> First it was endearing"
172,00:11:31.33,00:11:31.33,"because it just seemed natural. Now it just seemed like, ""Oh,"
173,00:11:33.90,00:11:33.90,"no, Mama got to work. Mama can't sit down."""
174,00:11:35.73,00:11:35.73,">> Now listen to me, I'm only going to tell you this once."
175,00:11:38.33,00:11:38.33,>> I heard it this morning already once.
176,00:11:40.17,00:11:40.17,>> Tool tree. >> I already heard it.
177,00:11:42.03,00:11:42.03,I know. I know everything needs to go
178,00:11:44.00,00:11:44.00,back where you find it. I know.
179,00:11:45.63,00:11:45.63,>> I'm tired of trying to... >> Where's the knife then?
180,00:11:57.37,00:11:57.37,">> PROBST: On Day 5, the tribes competed for some valuable"
181,00:12:00.87,00:12:00.87,fishing gear. Want to know what you're playing
182,00:12:03.63,00:12:03.63,for? >> Yeah.
183,00:12:04.40,00:12:04.40,">> PROBST: Mask, snorkel, fins. >> Yeah!"
184,00:12:09.10,00:12:09.10,>> PROBST: Survivors ready?! Go!
185,00:12:19.93,00:12:19.93,Rotu! (cheering)
186,00:12:22.50,00:12:22.50,"Rotu won the mask and fins, but there were more victories to"
187,00:12:26.20,00:12:26.20,come. >> What do we got today?
188,00:12:34.47,00:12:34.47,">> Oh, my God, it's a fork. >> PROBST: Getting a utensil in"
189,00:12:37.73,00:12:37.73,the mail on Day 6 could only mean one thing.
190,00:12:40.20,00:12:40.20,>> A food challenge. >> Yeah!
191,00:12:45.17,00:12:45.17,>> PROBST: And it was. The tribes had to eat ...
192,00:12:47.67,00:12:47.67,a Marquesan delicacy of fish soaking in fermented sea water.
193,00:12:53.20,00:12:53.20,Rob choked and Maraamu lost their third challenge in a row.
194,00:13:00.67,00:13:00.67,"So Maraamu headed back to Tribal Council, where in a 4-3 vote,"
195,00:13:04.77,00:13:04.77,"Patricia, known as the tribe's mom, was voted out."
196,00:13:08.07,00:13:08.07,"Patricia, the tribe has spoken. Maraamu lost their second tribe"
197,00:13:13.03,00:13:13.03,member. It's time for you to go.
198,00:13:23.33,00:13:23.33,Day 7 would prove to be a lesson in pain for Rotu.
199,00:13:27.00,00:13:27.00,"While snorkeling for food, John was the first victim."
200,00:13:32.97,00:13:32.97,">> I landed right on top of a sea urchin, and embedded about"
201,00:13:36.97,00:13:36.97,12 sea urchin needles in my fingers.
202,00:13:39.80,00:13:39.80,I got to go back in and get somebody to pee on it.
203,00:13:42.47,00:13:42.47,That's what you're supposed to do from that kind of a venomous
204,00:13:46.20,00:13:46.20,sting from a sea urchin is to urinate on it.
205,00:13:48.87,00:13:48.87,I need somebody who can pee on my hand.
206,00:13:51.03,00:13:51.03,Someone have to go to the bathroom?
207,00:13:53.47,00:13:53.47,">> PROBST: Luckily, someone did. >> I didn't even think it was"
208,00:13:59.33,00:13:59.33,weird that she was squatting down and I had my hand between
209,00:14:01.77,00:14:01.77,her legs. >> Good thing you had to go to
210,00:14:03.23,00:14:03.23,the bathroom. (laughing)
211,00:14:06.07,00:14:06.07,">> PROBST: On Day 8, bamboo and rope were delivered to the"
212,00:14:09.63,00:14:09.63,tribes. >> To what do we owe this honor?
213,00:14:11.70,00:14:11.70,>> PROBST: I come bearing supplies for your next
214,00:14:14.03,00:14:14.03,"challenge. At Rotu, the tribe was dealt a"
215,00:14:19.30,00:14:19.30,painful blow again. >> A big rock got in between my
216,00:14:25.93,00:14:25.93,shoe and my foot and just sliced up my toe nicely.
217,00:14:29.13,00:14:29.13,>> PROBST: And again. >> John actually stuck his hand
218,00:14:33.40,00:14:33.40,underneath a rock and an eel bit him.
219,00:14:35.40,00:14:35.40,">> Oh, my God. What is going on?"
220,00:14:44.17,00:14:44.17,(shouting) >> PROBST: But not even injuries
221,00:14:49.27,00:14:49.27,could stop a closely-knit Rotu tribe as they beat Maraamu in a
222,00:14:52.70,00:14:52.70,tight finish in the reward challenge.
223,00:14:54.73,00:14:54.73,Rotu! >> Ready to rock?
224,00:15:01.43,00:15:01.43,>> Everybody wants to go. >> PROBST: Maraamu set out for a
225,00:15:04.87,00:15:04.87,hike on Day 9. >> Patricia went for a hike one
226,00:15:08.60,00:15:08.60,"day by herself, found a stream on the other side of the hill,"
227,00:15:11.63,00:15:11.63,so I think that could be something that we need to go
228,00:15:14.23,00:15:14.23,check out. It's also a good opportunity for
229,00:15:16.30,00:15:16.30,us all to get out and do something together as a tribe.
230,00:15:22.87,00:15:22.87,>> Is the creek definitely down there?
231,00:15:24.63,00:15:24.63,>> It ends down there. It's pretty direct.
232,00:15:26.87,00:15:26.87,It's just it's steep. >> This is doing a whole lot for
233,00:15:33.33,00:15:33.33,me. I thought it was an easy walk to
234,00:15:37.03,00:15:37.03,the creek. >> It comes right out of the
235,00:15:39.37,00:15:39.37,"rocks, a little bit to this side of where I think the river is"
236,00:15:42.13,00:15:42.13,"going to come out. >> But after all of this, we're"
237,00:15:44.13,00:15:44.13,going to spend ten minutes and leave?
238,00:15:45.57,00:15:45.57,">> And then climb back up? >> Hunter, he's just up and"
239,00:15:48.97,00:15:48.97,"always busy, the thing is we didn't come here to exert"
240,00:15:52.37,00:15:52.37,ourselves in this tropical heat. Damn all this other work.
241,00:15:55.60,00:15:55.60,We need energy to get those damn challenges.
242,00:15:57.67,00:15:57.67,">> PROBST: Go! In the immunity challenge, the"
243,00:16:00.27,00:16:00.27,tribes battled it out in a coconut maze race.
244,00:16:02.83,00:16:02.83,">> In the hole, here we go! Yeah!"
245,00:16:09.17,00:16:09.17,>> PROBST: Maraamu lost yet again.
246,00:16:13.83,00:16:13.83,So Rob strategized behind the scenes and became the tribe's
247,00:16:17.37,00:16:17.37,puppet master. >> It's important for me to have
248,00:16:20.30,00:16:20.30,people on my team that are going to do what I tell them to do.
249,00:16:24.23,00:16:24.23,Game always keeps you thinking. It really does.
250,00:16:27.57,00:16:27.57,Fear keeps people loyal. If they're afraid they have
251,00:16:31.00,00:16:31.00,"something to lose, then they'll do what they tell you to do."
252,00:16:33.90,00:16:33.90,That's straight out of The  Godfather.
253,00:16:36.93,00:16:36.93,It's true. >> PROBST: It was a shocking
254,00:16:46.03,00:16:46.03,"Tribal Council, as Maraamu voted out the strongest member of"
255,00:16:48.77,00:16:48.77,"their tribe. Hunter, the tribe has spoken."
256,00:17:00.83,00:17:00.83,First step: pick a disk. Doesn't matter.
257,00:17:03.50,00:17:03.50,It's totally random. Follow your gut.
258,00:17:05.33,00:17:05.33,Go wherever you want. On Day 10 the tribes came
259,00:17:07.80,00:17:07.80,together for the biggest twist in the game yet.
260,00:17:10.37,00:17:10.37,"Okay. Zoe, you're first."
261,00:17:12.50,00:17:12.50,Step off your disk. Pull off your new buff.
262,00:17:16.83,00:17:16.83,Take your old one off. Put your new one on.
263,00:17:18.87,00:17:18.87,The tribes were randomly switched up.
264,00:17:26.10,00:17:26.10,Some friendships remained together.
265,00:17:27.73,00:17:27.73,>> Yeah! Pappy's on our team. >> We got Pappy.
266,00:17:32.57,00:17:32.57,>> PROBST: While others were torn apart.
267,00:17:34.43,00:17:34.43,"Rob, you're now a member of Rotu."
268,00:17:37.47,00:17:37.47,"Sarah. All right, Sarah, same buff,"
269,00:17:42.63,00:17:42.63,still a member of Maraamu. But for the remaining 13
270,00:17:46.73,00:17:46.73,"survivors, all bets were off. It was time to play a brand-new"
271,00:17:50.50,00:17:50.50,"game. At Maraamu, Kathy, Paschal, and"
272,00:17:56.53,00:17:56.53,Neleh were pleased with their new camp.
273,00:17:59.10,00:17:59.10,">> That forest is so beautiful. >> Well, let's show you guys"
274,00:18:02.97,00:18:02.97,around. >> This is a breadfruit.
275,00:18:04.83,00:18:04.83,This is a mango tree. >> All you got to do is pick up
276,00:18:08.57,00:18:08.57,the limes off the ground. >> I just got off of a tribe
277,00:18:11.23,00:18:11.23,"that would get up at dawn, check the pig pit, you know, and go"
278,00:18:14.30,00:18:14.30,"out and forage for shells. So to us, we feel like it was a"
279,00:18:17.37,00:18:17.37,"four-star hotel and that there's fruit on the table, so it was"
280,00:18:20.77,00:18:20.77,pretty nice. >> PROBST: For the new members
281,00:18:25.77,00:18:25.77,"of Rotu, life seemed pleasant as well."
282,00:18:27.87,00:18:27.87,They were ecstatic when they saw their new water source.
283,00:18:33.43,00:18:33.43,">> Yeah! >> It is so, so good."
284,00:18:43.03,00:18:43.03,>> I didn't even know what else to say.
285,00:18:47.73,00:18:47.73,">> I'm loving it. >> Good, I'm glad to hear it."
286,00:18:49.70,00:18:49.70,">> I am loving it. >> Now they see this, I'm like,"
287,00:18:51.80,00:18:51.80,"hey, you know, this ain't too bad."
288,00:19:02.23,00:19:02.23,"(singing) >> PROBST: On Day 11, Sean"
289,00:19:12.87,00:19:12.87,introduced his new tribe to the radio program.
290,00:19:22.00,00:19:22.00,">> Girl, you know you... (singing)"
291,00:19:30.47,00:19:30.47,">> When we landed here on Rotu camp, we told them about some of"
292,00:19:34.30,00:19:34.30,"the things that we did on our camp, like the early morning"
293,00:19:37.83,00:19:37.83,"show, and they were more than willing to try it."
294,00:19:40.77,00:19:40.77,">> No longer are they down with the Maraamu, we could never say"
295,00:19:43.97,00:19:43.97,"our name right, so I'm not going to say it right this morning."
296,00:19:47.13,00:19:47.13,>> Rotu can do! >> That's right: Rotu can do.
297,00:19:51.47,00:19:51.47,And we're going to head over and get a food report from our main
298,00:19:55.20,00:19:55.20,"chef, Johnny Pots and Pans. >> At first I thought we might"
299,00:19:58.30,00:19:58.30,"all start off with a little raw coconut, and if we go searching"
300,00:20:02.43,00:20:02.43,"pretty hard, we might find ourselves some sea urchins, but"
301,00:20:04.87,00:20:04.87,watch those spines. Back to you.
302,00:20:07.63,00:20:07.63,>> These three new members brought I guess a sense of humor
303,00:20:11.23,00:20:11.23,"that I don't think we had before, and it was fun."
304,00:20:14.23,00:20:14.23,>> Why don't you give us an overall report on things on this
305,00:20:17.27,00:20:17.27,island. How are things going on the
306,00:20:19.03,00:20:19.03,Marquesan Islands? >> (with Australian accent):
307,00:20:21.00,00:20:21.00,"Well, we're all settling in to our new habits, looking for a"
308,00:20:23.23,00:20:23.23,"new place to hang up some clothes, find a place to sleep,"
309,00:20:25.33,00:20:25.33,all try to get together. I'm sure we can do it in the
310,00:20:27.40,00:20:27.40,speed of the Thames here. I'm sure we can pull through in
311,00:20:29.77,00:20:29.77,"the end. Back to you, Rock."
312,00:20:30.93,00:20:30.93,>> They seemed like they enjoyed it.
313,00:20:32.83,00:20:32.83,We all can sit around and have fun and laugh and bond in other
314,00:20:36.13,00:20:36.13,ways than just working. >> The in people will be
315,00:20:38.90,00:20:38.90,sporting lovely new buffs. You can wrap them around your
316,00:20:43.13,00:20:43.13,head in any manner whatsoever. >> You can sit down and
317,00:20:45.77,00:20:45.77,"self-disclose yourself and laugh, and seemed like the radio"
318,00:20:48.77,00:20:48.77,show was well received. That concludes our wake-up show
319,00:20:51.33,00:20:51.33,"for this morning. Stay tuned tomorrow same time,"
320,00:20:53.37,00:20:53.37,same station. We'll see you guys tomorrow.
321,00:20:55.13,00:20:55.13,"Have a good day, and remember, God loves you."
322,00:21:03.60,00:21:03.60,>> PROBST: The two new tribes squared off against each other
323,00:21:06.77,00:21:06.77,in an immunity challenge on Day 12.
324,00:21:08.60,00:21:08.60,Today's immunity challenge is all about the weaving.
325,00:21:11.37,00:21:11.37,Each of you have a woven tapestry that is scrambled.
326,00:21:15.37,00:21:15.37,It's very simple. The first tribe to unscramble it
327,00:21:18.83,00:21:18.83,correctly wins immunity. Losing tribe: Tribal Council
328,00:21:22.60,00:21:22.60,tonight with me. But Rotu continued to function
329,00:21:25.53,00:21:25.53,"like a well-oiled machine, and they beat Maraamu again."
330,00:21:28.77,00:21:28.77,>> Here it comes. >> That's it.
331,00:21:31.43,00:21:31.43,That's it. That's it right there.
332,00:21:34.87,00:21:34.87,>> PROBST: Rotu! >> Rotu!
333,00:21:36.97,00:21:36.97,>> Yes! >> All right!
334,00:21:45.10,00:21:45.10,">> PROBST: So the new Maraamu headed to Tribal Council, where"
335,00:21:48.47,00:21:48.47,"the old Rotu members, along with Gina, voted Sarah out."
336,00:21:53.47,00:21:53.47,"Sarah, the tribe has spoken. Paranoia swept over Rotu on Day"

339,00:22:09.27,00:22:09.27,game? >> To me it's tell the truth.
340,00:22:11.40,00:22:11.40,Be honest. Are you saying that you would
341,00:22:13.60,00:22:13.60,lie to win this game? >> I'm not even here to play the
342,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97,"game, man. >> Gabriel said he's not playing"
343,00:22:17.50,00:22:17.50,"the game. I just, I don't believe it."
344,00:22:19.17,00:22:19.17,"I mean, you are here to play this game."
345,00:22:21.07,00:22:21.07,"You're not here on a commune. You know, this is not the '60s"
346,00:22:24.13,00:22:24.13,"and, you know, free love and all that kind of stuff."
347,00:22:26.93,00:22:26.93,">> PROBST: To solidify his position, John decided to create"

350,00:22:37.27,00:22:37.27,"that I know will not vote for me, just plain and simple."
351,00:22:41.57,00:22:41.57,"So what we're shooting for is the final four is myself, you"
352,00:22:45.63,00:22:45.63,Tammy and Rob. Just voting as bloc.
353,00:22:48.50,00:22:48.50,"Trust me 100%. I mean, I don't even know what"
354,00:22:51.07,00:22:51.07,else I can say to you. Split my hand open and rub blood
355,00:22:53.40,00:22:53.40,"on you. I mean, I have your back."
356,00:22:55.00,00:22:55.00,"I mean, you are, you are my partner."

363,00:23:20.63,00:23:20.63,ask thee if thou would please help us find all the things that
364,00:23:23.60,00:23:23.60,we need to today. That we may be able to work hard
365,00:23:25.97,00:23:25.97,together as team. >> I think we all have a spirit

367,00:23:33.47,00:23:33.47,>> PROBST: Gina was correct. It was their time.
368,00:23:36.33,00:23:36.33,At the reward challenge the tiny Maraamu tribe emerged
369,00:23:39.70,00:23:39.70,victorious. >> Hurry!

414,00:26:40.23,00:26:40.23,experience. And everyone else was there to
415,00:26:42.40,00:26:42.40,"play the game, and Gabe was voted out."

563,00:35:39.90,00:35:39.90,">> One, two, three, Soliantu! >> PROBST: But the good cheer"
564,00:35:45.27,00:35:45.27,"and camaraderie at Soliantu disappeared on Day 21, when Rob"
565,00:35:49.03,00:35:49.03,"confronted Zoe. >> Zoe, you didn't have an"
566,00:35:51.20,00:35:51.20,agreement about taking everybody from their side of the island
567,00:35:53.93,00:35:53.93,off? You don't remember anything
568,00:35:56.27,00:35:56.27,about that? >> No.
569,00:35:57.43,00:35:57.43,">> See, this is what I mean. Unbelievable."
570,00:35:59.43,00:35:59.43,And Kathy wasn't your first choice as soon as she got here?
571,00:36:02.30,00:36:02.30,"Tell the truth, for once, will you?"
572,00:36:04.17,00:36:04.17,"Tell the truth. >> PROBST: Kathy, disillusioned"
573,00:36:07.77,00:36:07.77,"and angry, fled to the waterfall."
574,00:36:11.47,00:36:11.47,>> Zoe's lying to me. They're all lying to me.
575,00:36:14.33,00:36:14.33,"They're all lying to me, and I'm being played as a pawn."
576,00:36:19.70,00:36:19.70,A pawn. I need the immunity because I'm
577,00:36:26.30,00:36:26.30,getting the ax. I don't know.
578,00:36:27.90,00:36:27.90,"It's just not adding up, but I'm going to trust what Rob told me"
579,00:36:31.00,00:36:31.00,and I need immunity to stay in the game.
580,00:36:32.90,00:36:32.90,>> PROBST: Survivors ready?! Go!
581,00:36:34.70,00:36:34.70,Out-balancing the others on an unsteady platform in the rough
582,00:36:39.40,00:36:39.40,"surf, Kathy won immunity. Kathy wins immunity."
583,00:36:43.20,00:36:43.20,You want this? >> Yeah!
584,00:36:44.37,00:36:44.37,">> PROBST: Come get it. >> All right, baby!"
585,00:36:50.10,00:36:50.10,>> PROBST: Turn around here. (cheering)
586,00:36:55.87,00:36:55.87,"Yes! Back at Soliantu, Rob accused"
587,00:36:58.73,00:36:58.73,John of backing out on his word. >> What happened about my word
588,00:37:02.40,00:37:02.40,"is my bond? >> Oh, yeah, mine was like fine,"
589,00:37:04.70,00:37:04.70,but as soon as you double- tracked and circled back and
590,00:37:07.47,00:37:07.47,"came up with other ideas, then it's like I'm done."
591,00:37:10.00,00:37:10.00,>> PROBST: But John accused Rob of breaking their agreement when
592,00:37:13.23,00:37:13.23,Rob spoke to Kathy. >> Don't tell me one thing and
593,00:37:15.73,00:37:15.73,just because I think about something or just because I talk
594,00:37:18.60,00:37:18.60,"to somebody, then all of a sudden it's off."
595,00:37:20.63,00:37:20.63,>> To be honest I'm not going to have this conversation.
596,00:37:23.27,00:37:23.27,I'm not going to decide for myself until we get there
597,00:37:25.60,00:37:25.60,tonight. >> I thought we had an
598,00:37:26.93,00:37:26.93,"agreement. >> We did, until you went to"
599,00:37:28.63,00:37:28.63,"Kathy and told her at the other side, and said they're going to"
600,00:37:31.43,00:37:31.43,vote you out first. >> I did not say that.
601,00:37:33.40,00:37:33.40,>> I'm not going to have this conversation.
602,00:37:35.53,00:37:35.53,Don't lie to my face. >> There we go.
603,00:37:37.40,00:37:37.40,"Now it's on, man. >> PROBST: In the end, all the"
604,00:37:40.03,00:37:40.03,drama in camp brought about Rob's demise.
605,00:37:42.27,00:37:42.27,"Even Rob's former Maraamu ally, Vecepia, wrote his name"
606,00:37:45.53,00:37:45.53,"down at the voting booth. Rob, the tribe has spoken."
607,00:37:50.40,00:37:50.40,">> Good luck, guys. >> PROBST: The next day, Kathy"
608,00:37:55.73,00:37:55.73,confronted Zoe. >> There was never any intention
609,00:37:59.00,00:37:59.00,"of voting you off, no way in hell."
610,00:38:01.37,00:38:01.37,We wanted to get Rotu back together as a team.
611,00:38:03.97,00:38:03.97,>> Zoe just lied to me point-blank about the fact that
612,00:38:07.33,00:38:07.33,the tribe had definitely scoped me out for the first vote off
613,00:38:11.13,00:38:11.13,"when we merged. Oh, my God, look, you guys."
614,00:38:15.27,00:38:15.27,>> PROBST: The tribe received materials to build kites for the
615,00:38:18.03,00:38:18.03,next reward challenge. >> Too much wind.
616,00:38:23.50,00:38:23.50,">> Oh, my kite is going to be a miserable failure."
617,00:38:26.63,00:38:26.63,">> Oh, stop it. >> I'm serious."
618,00:38:29.90,00:38:29.90,">> Oh, go fly a kite. >> PROBST: So they did."
619,00:38:40.50,00:38:40.50,"Run, John run! Competing for the chance to have"
620,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,"a Snickers bar and then go scuba diving, the survivors attempted"
621,00:38:48.27,00:38:48.27,"to fly their kites into the Marquesan sky, but it was Kathy"
622,00:38:51.73,00:38:51.73,who went the distance. >> Yeah!
623,00:38:53.53,00:38:53.53,Yeah! Woo!
624,00:38:59.33,00:38:59.33,">> PROBST: Underwater, Kathy experienced the serene world of"
625,00:39:02.50,00:39:02.50,Marquesan marine life. On land things weren't as
626,00:39:08.27,00:39:08.27,"peaceful, as Sean fought for his survival."
627,00:39:10.97,00:39:10.97,>> I get frustrated because I feel like nobody is playing the
628,00:39:14.80,00:39:14.80,"game, and I feel like we've kind of succumbed, and let the four"
629,00:39:18.77,00:39:18.77,"people run the show. >> I telling you, I'm going to"
630,00:39:21.77,00:39:21.77,talk with Kathy. >> I totally agree with you.
631,00:39:24.30,00:39:24.30,I think Tammy and John are playing a game and they're
632,00:39:27.27,00:39:27.27,"playing it so hard, it's obnoxious."
633,00:39:29.23,00:39:29.23,">> If you're in agreement, me you and V are on the same"
634,00:39:32.33,00:39:32.33,"wavelength. >> Yeah, we are."
635,00:39:34.07,00:39:34.07,But we just need to get Paschal and Neleh.
636,00:39:36.90,00:39:36.90,"And you know what, I think we can do it."
637,00:39:41.60,00:39:41.60,">> My boy. >> PROBST: On Day 24, the"
638,00:39:43.73,00:39:43.73,"immunity challenge was a game of elimination, but Sean, Vecepia"
639,00:39:47.80,00:39:47.80,and Kathy saw it as the alliance's arrogant display of
640,00:39:50.87,00:39:50.87,"the pecking order, showing who they would be voting out next."
641,00:39:54.83,00:39:54.83,>> This is the order of how it's going to go.
642,00:39:57.37,00:39:57.37,>> Way to go. >> I swear we could take them
643,00:40:01.63,00:40:01.63,out. I swear we could.
644,00:40:02.83,00:40:02.83,">> PROBST: Tammy won immunity, and she, John, Zoe and the"
645,00:40:06.27,00:40:06.27,General openly celebrated their victory.
646,00:40:08.87,00:40:08.87,>> I almost was going to do you because I hated to get Paschal
647,00:40:12.30,00:40:12.30,another time. >> It didn't seem to bother you
648,00:40:15.27,00:40:15.27,that much. >> PROBST: Neleh and Paschal
649,00:40:17.00,00:40:17.00,were also angered by the arrogant conduct the foursome
650,00:40:19.67,00:40:19.67,had displayed during the challenge.
651,00:40:21.40,00:40:21.40,">> There was a pecking order and we were included in it, even"
652,00:40:24.83,00:40:24.83,though we were told that that wasn't true.
653,00:40:27.20,00:40:27.20,>> PROBST: And decided to take matters into their own hands.
654,00:40:30.27,00:40:30.27,>> I'm not going to go out fifth or sixth.
655,00:40:32.17,00:40:32.17,"We've worked too hard. >> PROBST: In the shelter,"
656,00:40:36.73,00:40:36.73,Vecepia apologized to Sean for siding with the alliance and
657,00:40:39.87,00:40:39.87,"voting against Rob. >> They came to me, six or seven"
658,00:40:43.30,00:40:43.30,days after we were here and told me they wanted to be part of the
659,00:40:47.57,00:40:47.57,"fivesome, and I said if you do not lie to me, I will go five"
660,00:40:51.03,00:40:51.03,"with you, and then once we get the five, it's every man for"
661,00:40:54.47,00:40:54.47,themselves. >> I just wish you had trusted
662,00:40:56.80,00:40:56.80,your brother a little more. You saw what they did to me and
663,00:41:00.47,00:41:00.47,Rob. I said these guys were...
664,00:41:02.43,00:41:02.43,">> Exactly. If I've done wrong with you, I"
665,00:41:05.20,00:41:05.20,apologize. I'm saying this right here and
666,00:41:07.90,00:41:07.90,"now. Straight up, I apologize to you."
667,00:41:10.33,00:41:10.33,">> PROBST: With Vecepia on board, the fivesome decided"
668,00:41:13.47,00:41:13.47,somebody needed to be done. >> Today is the last day we will
669,00:41:18.73,00:41:18.73,ever get a fair chance. After that it's going to be four
670,00:41:21.27,00:41:21.27,and four. It's going to be up for vote and
671,00:41:23.17,00:41:23.17,"it's just the way I feel, you guys, right now, and I'm being"
672,00:41:25.87,00:41:25.87,"honest with you. >> Obviously, Paschal and Neleh"
673,00:41:28.30,00:41:28.30,"started to see what I've been talking about all along, that"
674,00:41:31.43,00:41:31.43,the four horsemen have an alliance.
675,00:41:33.30,00:41:33.30,"They've been switching on and off, first with me and Rob,"
676,00:41:37.10,00:41:37.10,then with her and Paschal. So now the new agreement we have
677,00:41:41.07,00:41:41.07,"is myself and Neleh, V, Paschal, and Kathy are going to vote John"
678,00:41:45.43,00:41:45.43,out tonight. >> PROBST: That night at Tribal
679,00:41:51.50,00:41:51.50,"Council, they struck back. The eight person voted out, the"
680,00:41:54.53,00:41:54.53,first member of our jury: John. You need to bring me your torch.
681,00:42:00.17,00:42:00.17,"The alliance of John, Tammy, Zoe and the General was broken when"
682,00:42:03.60,00:42:03.60,John was voted out of the tribe. The tribe has spoken.
683,00:42:12.03,00:42:12.03,It's time for you to go. Good night.
684,00:42:16.87,00:42:16.87,"John was the eighth person to go, but he will return as the"
685,00:42:20.67,00:42:20.67,first member of the jury which will ultimately decide who will
686,00:42:24.13,00:42:24.13,"be the sole Survivor. Over the next 15 days, the"
687,00:42:27.10,00:42:27.10,Soliantu tribe will experience the culture and the game in ways
688,00:42:31.07,00:42:31.07,unlike any survivors before them.
689,00:42:32.97,00:42:32.97,Join us as the adventure continues.
690,00:42:40.80,00:42:40.80,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.

692,00:42:48.77,00:42:48.77,marks a new era at Soliantu. >> It's a new day we're starting
693,00:42:51.87,00:42:51.87,here! Friends become bitter enemies.
694,00:42:53.93,00:42:53.93,>> From the get-go I didn't like you.
695,00:42:56.10,00:42:56.10,>> I have changed my opinion of Zoe.
696,00:42:57.77,00:42:57.77,Zoe is a bitch. >> PROBST: And two lucky
697,00:42:59.67,00:42:59.67,survivors get away from it all. Now for the reward:
698,00:43:02.20,00:43:02.20,an authentic Marquesan feast. >> Give me the radio right
699,00:43:12.70,00:43:12.70,there. It's the wake-up show.
700,00:43:18.43,00:43:18.43,It's the wake-up show. It's the wake-up show.
701,00:43:21.10,00:43:21.10,It's the wake-up show. Rah!
702,00:43:23.87,00:43:23.87,"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen."
703,00:43:26.60,00:43:26.60,"Good morning. >> Ding, ding, ding."
