110,00:07:36.70,00:07:36.70,"And on Day 3, the game became aharsh reality, as Maraamu"
111,00:07:40.50,00:07:40.50,realized they had to vote outone of their own.
112,00:07:43.67,00:07:43.67,>> My strategy is to keep thestrong as strong as possible.
113,00:07:47.63,00:07:47.63,>> Peter got on our nerves alittle bit this morning because

126,00:08:24.77,00:08:24.77,shifted from survival to aparanoia state.
127,00:08:27.63,00:08:27.63,I believe that Peter has takenit to the extreme.
