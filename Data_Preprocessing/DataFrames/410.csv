5,00:00:10.60,00:00:10.60,">> When I give you my word, my word is huge."
6,00:00:12.60,00:00:12.60,It's the most important thing to me.
7,00:00:14.23,00:00:14.23,">> Neleh and Paschal, I think, are really supporting my success"
8,00:00:17.67,00:00:17.67,in this game. >> Three strikes and you're out!
9,00:00:20.03,00:00:20.03,>> PROBST: But the alliance's blatant display of power at the
10,00:00:22.73,00:00:22.73,immunity challenge caused Paschal and Neleh to rise up
11,00:00:26.27,00:00:26.27,against them. >> They just didn't play it
12,00:00:28.37,00:00:28.37,smart in that game. I'm not going to go out fifth or
13,00:00:30.73,00:00:30.73,sixth. We've worked too hard.
14,00:00:32.03,00:00:32.03,">> PROBST: At Tribal Council, they joined V., Sean and Kathy,"
15,00:00:35.50,00:00:35.50,"and voted John, the leader of the alliance, off the island."
16,00:00:39.17,00:00:39.17,"John, the tribe has spoken. >> Okeydoke."
17,00:00:42.43,00:00:42.43,>> PROBST: Eight are left. Who will be voted out tonight?
18,00:01:51.57,00:01:51.57,">> Very nice. >> Oh, God, it's so good!"
19,00:01:55.80,00:01:55.80,It's a new day. I think I can win.
20,00:01:59.37,00:01:59.37,\xe2\x99\xaa Can't you feel a brand-new day?
21,00:02:01.13,00:02:01.13,Can't you feel a brand-new day? \xe2\x99\xaa
22,00:02:02.87,00:02:02.87,>> All right! >> BOTH: \xe2\x99\xaa Can't you feel
23,00:02:05.63,00:02:05.63,a brand-new day \xe2\x99\xaa \xe2\x99\xaa Can't you feel

25,00:02:13.50,00:02:13.50,"a brand-new day? \xe2\x99\xaa >> Woo, I love that song."
26,00:02:17.87,00:02:17.87,">> I feel so good this morning. I found myself before, kind of"
27,00:02:21.40,00:02:21.40,"having my destiny in other people's hands, and now it's a"
28,00:02:24.67,00:02:24.67,new spirit. It's a new day we're starting
29,00:02:27.77,00:02:27.77,"here! Hello, world!"
30,00:02:29.67,00:02:29.67,">> Hello, world! >> You're going to be the first"
31,00:02:33.10,00:02:33.10,"jet beauty of the week. >> Now that myself, Kathy, V.,"
32,00:02:36.97,00:02:36.97,"Pappy and Neleh got together, we said you know what, truly may"
33,00:02:42.33,00:02:42.33,"the best man win, with no alliance."
34,00:02:45.33,00:02:45.33,>> Marquesan islands! >> It is beautiful!
35,00:02:55.77,00:02:55.77,">> We want the people who play this game fairly, and don't try"
36,00:03:00.50,00:03:00.50,"and manipulate people, to have a good chance to get to the top."
37,00:03:05.23,00:03:05.23,">> This is funny, I mean, to see that we had turned around"
38,00:03:10.37,00:03:10.37,"like that at the last second, and beat them at their own game,"
39,00:03:13.03,00:03:13.03,"I just think it's hilarious, like I just laugh my head off."
40,00:03:40.60,00:03:40.60,">> Oh, yeah. The taro that did it."
41,00:03:43.40,00:03:43.40,">> Okay, all the lamps are fixed and full."
42,00:03:46.80,00:03:46.80,">> All right! >> The mood is very, very happy"
43,00:03:50.43,00:03:50.43,"among those five people. I mean, they're all very..."
44,00:03:53.87,00:03:53.87,"they're happy. You know, they're sitting"
45,00:03:55.70,00:03:55.70,"pretty, they've got five of them."
46,00:03:56.90,00:03:56.90,>> We're going to have to go to bed at night.
47,00:03:59.17,00:03:59.17,>> It's so important that we just maintain this.
48,00:04:01.67,00:04:01.67,"Maintain this. >> I got to tell you one thing,"
49,00:04:03.67,00:04:03.67,"though, we need to have some fun today."
50,00:04:05.40,00:04:05.40,">> I know, for real. >> I want to find some more"
51,00:04:08.13,00:04:08.13,"cowry shells. So when you guys are going, I'm"
52,00:04:10.53,00:04:10.53,going to be in search of cowry shells.
53,00:04:12.50,00:04:12.50,>> Okay. >> We're two outcasts.
54,00:04:16.17,00:04:16.17,>> I feel like an outcast sitting over here.
55,00:04:19.77,00:04:19.77,>> You can't make them come over and hang out with us.
56,00:04:22.10,00:04:22.10,>> They see us as traitors. Even though they've all done the
57,00:04:27.60,00:04:27.60,"same. >> Oh, yeah."
58,00:04:28.80,00:04:28.80,>> I want to be so truthful. I just want to be truthful.
59,00:04:31.73,00:04:31.73,">> We have been from day one. That's why I said, you know"
60,00:04:33.43,00:04:33.43,"what, when it comes down to it, I want to be with people"
61,00:04:35.43,00:04:35.43,that are going to be honest with me.
62,00:04:36.73,00:04:36.73,">> Basically, we got screwed because of John."
63,00:04:40.13,00:04:40.13,"It's our fault for trusting him. I think that myself, Rob and"
64,00:04:45.03,00:04:45.03,"Zoe all have targets on our back, because of the alliance,"
65,00:04:50.00,00:04:50.00,"and unless something changes in the next few days, because I'm"
66,00:04:54.63,00:04:54.63,"seen as the ""leader"" after John, I'm the next to go."
67,00:04:58.53,00:04:58.53,">> You, then me, kid. That's the pecking order."
68,00:05:02.10,00:05:02.10,>> Yeah. That's all right. Thanks.
69,00:05:05.23,00:05:05.23,We'll see. The game's not over yet.
70,00:05:08.70,00:05:08.70,My allegiance is to Zoe and Rob at this point.
71,00:05:13.40,00:05:13.40,"Zoe fits right into that group now, huh?"
72,00:05:17.67,00:05:17.67,I really don't know what game Zoe is playing.
73,00:05:20.53,00:05:20.53,I wanted to see how strong our alliance was.
74,00:05:23.40,00:05:23.40,"I just told Zoe, I said, you know, I'm glad that, you know,"
75,00:05:27.87,00:05:27.87,"we were on a team for a while. Well, it was a pretty loose"
76,00:05:34.57,00:05:34.57,friendship on my line. The alliance was...
77,00:05:41.23,00:05:41.23,">> I mean, whatever game you want to play now is fine, but"
78,00:05:44.53,00:05:44.53,that's not what you were saying earlier.
79,00:05:46.83,00:05:46.83,"Zoe tried to say that she wasn't in alliance with John, Rob and"
80,00:05:53.83,00:05:53.83,myself. And you know what?
81,00:05:56.00,00:05:56.00,That's just not true. If you want me to keep my mouth
82,00:05:58.80,00:05:58.80,"shut now, so you can play your game, that's one thing."
83,00:06:00.80,00:06:00.80,Be straight with me. I'd respect that much more than
84,00:06:04.30,00:06:04.30,... me right now. >> You want me to tell you from
85,00:06:07.80,00:06:07.80,"the get-go, I didn't like you. I didn't really dig you."
86,00:06:11.30,00:06:11.30,"I didn't like dig the way your eyes were, your presentation."
87,00:06:16.73,00:06:16.73,>> I have changed my opinion of Zoe.
88,00:06:19.00,00:06:19.00,"Zoe is a bitch. I mean, she's just trying to"
89,00:06:21.37,00:06:21.37,save her own butt right now. Maybe her true colors will start
90,00:06:24.37,00:06:24.37,"to, you know, shine through and somebody will figure out who she"
91,00:06:27.60,00:06:27.60,is and want to vote her off instead of me.
92,00:06:29.70,00:06:29.70,">> As far as the game goes now, I don't trust you."
93,00:06:33.03,00:06:33.03,>> I don't trust you either. >> Cool.
94,00:06:34.77,00:06:34.77,"Then let's go gather some shells, because that's what I"
95,00:06:37.37,00:06:37.37,came here for. I didn't come here for a bunch
96,00:06:39.90,00:06:39.90,of .... I came here to get some shells.
97,00:06:42.27,00:06:42.27,I'm distancing myself from Tammy at this point.
98,00:06:46.37,00:06:46.37,I'm here to win. I'm here to be the final
99,00:06:48.90,00:06:48.90,"Survivor, and if I had to say something to someone and do"
100,00:06:51.40,00:06:51.40,something exactly the opposite without them knowing or them
101,00:06:54.83,00:06:54.83,"finding out later, well, that's just the way it is."
102,00:06:57.83,00:06:57.83,That's the way life is. >> Uh-oh.
103,00:07:08.23,00:07:08.23,A big coconut. We got mail!
104,00:07:12.97,00:07:12.97,You guys are going to be so in love.
105,00:07:15.63,00:07:15.63,"Okay, you guys ready? ""Hard as a rock, sweet as can"
106,00:07:19.57,00:07:19.57,"be, tough to get into as you soon will see."
107,00:07:22.97,00:07:22.97,"You're going to pair up, but you won't know with whom,"
108,00:07:26.47,00:07:26.47,"full bellies and a party if you both can pull through."""
109,00:07:30.63,00:07:30.63,(cheering) >> This is going to be good.
110,00:07:44.57,00:07:44.57,">> PROBST: Okay. For today's reward challenge,"
111,00:07:47.67,00:07:47.67,"you will compete as teams, four teams of two."
112,00:07:50.73,00:07:50.73,You guys have already randomly drawn lots to determine who's
113,00:07:53.43,00:07:53.43,"paired with who. Sean and Paschal, Tammy and"
114,00:07:56.27,00:07:56.27,"Vecepia, Kathy and the General, Neleh and Zoe."
115,00:07:59.73,00:07:59.73,"Your goal today, fill your three-foot tall bamboo shoot to"
116,00:08:03.77,00:08:03.77,the top with coconut juice. You can gather the coconuts in
117,00:08:07.47,00:08:07.47,"two ways, you can swim far out and get the large parcels of"
118,00:08:10.40,00:08:10.40,"coconuts that are anchored in the water, or you can stay here"
119,00:08:13.10,00:08:13.10,on shore and pick up the coconuts that are scattered
120,00:08:15.50,00:08:15.50,along the beach. First team to fill their chute
121,00:08:19.20,00:08:19.20,wins. Now for the reward.
122,00:08:21.47,00:08:21.47,The winning team will be picked up at your beach by helicopter.
123,00:08:24.37,00:08:24.37,You'll be dropped off atop a mountain where two horses will
124,00:08:27.27,00:08:27.27,be waiting for you. You will take a really fun ride
125,00:08:30.63,00:08:30.63,down to an authentic full-on Marquesan feast.
126,00:08:34.07,00:08:34.07,You'll come back fully sated and ready for your last 13 days.
127,00:08:38.57,00:08:38.57,"Make sense? Take your spots, wait for my go."
128,00:08:44.17,00:08:44.17,"Remember, you can get individual coconuts on the beach or those"
129,00:08:47.77,00:08:47.77,tethered out in the water. Survivors ready!
130,00:08:52.07,00:08:52.07,Go! >> That a way Sean.
131,00:09:48.80,00:09:48.80,Sean and Paschal with a really healthy coconut!
132,00:09:55.33,00:09:55.33,"You guys need to pick it up. You guys are dry, what's up?"
133,00:10:01.40,00:10:01.40,"Keep working hard, guys. Kathy and General, you guys need"
134,00:10:09.07,00:10:09.07,"to pick it up. >> Come on, let's get going."
135,00:10:11.70,00:10:11.70,"Let's do it, man. >> Okay."
136,00:10:13.23,00:10:13.23,"This is a healthy one, too. >> Okay, let's do that one."
137,00:10:16.57,00:10:16.57,You might want to try to chop that other one.
138,00:10:19.20,00:10:19.20,">> PROBST: You're in this game, guys, keep it up."
139,00:10:21.97,00:10:21.97,">> You got it, Zoe. Look at that, you're in the game"
140,00:10:25.07,00:10:25.07,"with one coconut. >> Oh, Zoe, we are on top of it."
141,00:10:29.13,00:10:29.13,">> PROBST: Keep fighting, guys. Sean got a system."
142,00:10:36.47,00:10:36.47,Sean and Paschal have a bit of a lead over Neleh and Zoe.
143,00:10:39.87,00:10:39.87,">> Pap, go get us some more coconuts."
144,00:10:42.47,00:10:42.47,I got this. >> Check them every once in a
145,00:10:44.97,00:10:44.97,"while. >> PROBST: Tammy and V, falling"
146,00:10:47.13,00:10:47.13,behind. You guys got a whole lot of
147,00:10:49.17,00:10:49.17,coconuts and no juice. Kathy and the General right back
148,00:10:51.97,00:10:51.97,"in it. >> This is it, we got the"
149,00:10:53.43,00:10:53.43,system. We're doing well.
150,00:10:55.27,00:10:55.27,">> PROBST: Zoe and Neleh, gaining fast."
151,00:10:57.93,00:10:57.93,"Now you're going, Sean. That a way, Vecepia."
152,00:11:04.90,00:11:04.90,One coconut can get you right back in it.
153,00:11:07.93,00:11:07.93,>> Keep going. >> PROBST: We got a game right
154,00:11:12.43,00:11:12.43,now. Sean and Paschal getting closer.
155,00:11:14.50,00:11:14.50,"Guys, don't let up. >> Get me some more, Pap."
156,00:11:18.60,00:11:18.60,">> More? >> Come on, I don't care if it's"
157,00:11:21.10,00:11:21.10,"hard, we've got to keep going! >> PROBST: Sean and Paschal very"
158,00:11:26.13,00:11:26.13,close. >> Pappy!
159,00:11:31.63,00:11:31.63,"We're not out of this yet, baby. >> PROBST: We're in a dead heat"
160,00:11:35.90,00:11:35.90,right now. >> We're going to win it.
161,00:11:37.77,00:11:37.77,This is your win. >> PROBST: This could be it.
162,00:11:48.43,00:11:48.43,Sean and Paschal! Nice work.
163,00:12:03.93,00:12:03.93,Well earned. Is this the most unlikely pair?
164,00:12:07.50,00:12:07.50,>> Huh? The old man and the brother.
165,00:12:09.37,00:12:09.37,>> The old man and the brother. >> PROBST: Pulled it out.
166,00:12:12.27,00:12:12.27,">> By the grace of God, man. >> PROBST: I guarantee you"
167,00:12:14.70,00:12:14.70,tomorrow is going to be a great day for you guys.
168,00:12:16.60,00:12:16.60,You guys can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow.
169,00:12:38.03,00:12:38.03,>> I'm ready. I'm ready for my mission.
170,00:12:41.27,00:12:41.27,>> I want a full description of it as soon as you get back.
171,00:12:44.40,00:12:44.40,">> Look at those clouds, you guys."
172,00:12:45.60,00:12:45.60,That's pretty cool. >> Look at the pink in the
173,00:12:49.07,00:12:49.07,clouds. >> I never thought I'd be
174,00:12:51.57,00:12:51.57,sitting here on day 26. >> Do I look okay?
175,00:12:54.50,00:12:54.50,">> You look beautiful. >> Oh, my God, remember, you"
176,00:12:57.57,00:12:57.57,have to have lots of alcohol and lots of pig.
177,00:12:59.90,00:12:59.90,>> That's right. >> I've got to eat slow because
178,00:13:02.37,00:13:02.37,"of my stomach. >> Yeah, go real slow, and get"
179,00:13:04.60,00:13:04.60,really silly and have so much fun.
180,00:13:06.30,00:13:06.30,I'm so happy for you two! >> Sean and Paschal won a
181,00:13:16.70,00:13:16.70,helicopter ride and awaiting them will be a Marquesan feast.
182,00:13:21.97,00:13:21.97,And I'm happy for them. Sean deserved it.
183,00:13:25.80,00:13:25.80,After all of the mess that some of these people in the Rotu
184,00:13:30.07,00:13:30.07,"tribe put him through, he was down, but he was never out."
185,00:13:34.50,00:13:34.50,>> See you when we get back. >> I'm about to start crying
186,00:13:37.80,00:13:37.80,with these guys. I'm so happy for them.
187,00:13:39.50,00:13:39.50,">> Oh, my God, I feel like they're going away."
188,00:13:42.57,00:13:42.57,>> They're only going to be gone a couple hours.
189,00:13:46.17,00:13:46.17,">> I know, but it's exciting. It's so exciting, isn't it?"
190,00:14:00.07,00:14:00.07,">> Pap, look how beautiful that is."
191,00:14:01.67,00:14:01.67,">> We're going to see this thing all the way through, buddy."
192,00:14:04.53,00:14:04.53,">> Yes, sir, man. >> This is getting ready to be"
193,00:14:06.53,00:14:06.53,"awesome. >> I'm going to tell you, man, I"
194,00:14:08.13,00:14:08.13,"love you, Pappy. >> You too, my man."
195,00:14:09.53,00:14:09.53,>> Now this is what I call a reward right here.
196,00:14:12.30,00:14:12.30,>> Unbelievable. >> Look at us!
197,00:14:21.43,00:14:21.43,>> Hello! >> This is crazy.
198,00:14:24.73,00:14:24.73,>> Look what we have coming here.
199,00:14:26.80,00:14:26.80,">> Pappy and I are standing there, like, okay."
200,00:14:28.97,00:14:28.97,All of a sudden these Marquesan men come down the hill with
201,00:14:31.77,00:14:31.77,"these horses. >> My name, Akatini."
202,00:14:34.07,00:14:34.07,>> Paschal. Akadimi?
203,00:14:35.67,00:14:35.67,>> Akatini. >> Akatini.
204,00:14:37.53,00:14:37.53,>> Sean. >> I got to get the wild one?
205,00:14:39.90,00:14:39.90,>> Your horse. He's okay.
206,00:14:41.30,00:14:41.30,>> Okay. The only horses I've been on are
207,00:14:45.80,00:14:45.80,merry-go-rounds in Central Park. Where does my other foot go?
208,00:14:49.50,00:14:49.50,"Okay. And it was a bit scary, because"
209,00:14:51.10,00:14:51.10,"it was huge, I mean, horses are big animals."
210,00:14:52.93,00:14:52.93,I hope these horses are all right.
211,00:14:54.47,00:14:54.47,"If they decide they want to throw you off, you're on the"
212,00:14:57.23,00:14:57.23,"ground with broken bones. Nice horsey, how you doing?"
213,00:15:01.57,00:15:01.57,Oh! He's biting him!
214,00:15:03.63,00:15:03.63,"Oh, my God. I want off."
215,00:15:07.30,00:15:07.30,">> Okay, come on here, on this horse, with me."
216,00:15:10.33,00:15:10.33,">> And the last thing you want to see is two horses, or the"
217,00:15:13.50,00:15:13.50,horses like biting each other and just... and just...
218,00:15:16.40,00:15:16.40,"Oh, see! But the Marquesan men seem to"
219,00:15:19.67,00:15:19.67,"have them under control, I'm like, no, this is not going to"
220,00:15:22.73,00:15:22.73,work. It really hurts.
221,00:15:26.07,00:15:26.07,"Wait, my balls. My balls."
222,00:15:29.77,00:15:29.77,"It really hurts. Oh, my God."
223,00:15:33.87,00:15:33.87,"You got to remember, we're not on flat land, we're on like a"
224,00:15:37.63,00:15:37.63,"mountain cliff. So if you fall off, you're"
225,00:15:39.63,00:15:39.63,falling off the damn mountain with a horse under you.
226,00:15:44.63,00:15:44.63,This is the kind of stuff that scares me.
227,00:15:47.40,00:15:47.40,">> It was a long ride for some of us not used to horses, but"
228,00:15:51.93,00:15:51.93,"Sean began to loosen up and began singing, and after they"
229,00:15:54.83,00:15:54.83,made some different arrangements.
230,00:15:56.53,00:15:56.53,>> \xe2\x99\xaa I'm chilling on a horse with Marquesan men
231,00:15:59.20,00:15:59.20,\xe2\x99\xaa Everybody knows that we want to do it again
232,00:16:02.40,00:16:02.40,"I said... \xe2\x99\xaa Oh, I hear the drums."
233,00:16:04.30,00:16:04.30,>> We're getting close. >> What?! What?!
234,00:16:10.57,00:16:10.57,Yeah. Marquesan forever!
235,00:16:17.27,00:16:17.27,>> Yahawa. >> Yahawa.
236,00:16:19.17,00:16:19.17,>> Yahanewi. >> Yahanewi!
237,00:16:22.93,00:16:22.93,>> This is better than  Gilligan's Island.
238,00:16:25.77,00:16:25.77,All right! What you doing afterwards?
239,00:16:29.90,00:16:29.90,">> My name is Layla. >> Layla, hi, I'm Sean."
240,00:16:34.67,00:16:34.67,"You're very pretty. A little too young for me,"
241,00:16:37.90,00:16:37.90,though. We get to the beach and these
242,00:16:40.10,00:16:40.10,"two beautiful, although young, Marquesan women lead us to these"
243,00:16:44.23,00:16:44.23,two beach chairs with these huge pillows with these two huge
244,00:16:48.47,00:16:48.47,coconut drinks. Here's to you Pap.
245,00:16:51.30,00:16:51.30,">> You too, baby. >> Success and happiness man."
246,00:16:53.77,00:16:53.77,>> I wish our team could see this.
247,00:16:55.43,00:16:55.43,">> Well, who knew that a little black boy from Harlem would be"
248,00:16:58.93,00:16:58.93,here with a judge... >> A Southern white judge.
249,00:17:01.33,00:17:01.33,>> A Southern white judge from Georgia.
250,00:17:02.90,00:17:02.90,"I dig the fate in that, the irony in that."
251,00:17:05.13,00:17:05.13,">> Two days ago, I would have mortgaged my house on the fact"
252,00:17:08.03,00:17:08.03,that Sean was going to be voted off.
253,00:17:09.80,00:17:09.80,But things have dramatically changed.
254,00:17:12.10,00:17:12.10,"Sean, while he may have some problems, he's honest."
255,00:17:15.37,00:17:15.37,He's straightforward. That's all I can ask.
256,00:17:18.33,00:17:18.33,>> Sometimes relationships start out rocky and to look and see
257,00:17:21.33,00:17:21.33,"where we ended up, man. The sky is the limit for all of"
258,00:17:24.43,00:17:24.43,us. >> We became much closer than we
259,00:17:26.10,00:17:26.10,"were, and I feel very close to him."
260,00:17:27.67,00:17:27.67,I feel very fortunate to know him.
261,00:17:29.47,00:17:29.47,"That's what's good about this game, you never know what's"
262,00:17:31.43,00:17:31.43,"going to happen. >> I'm ready to eat, man."
263,00:17:33.47,00:17:33.47,Are you? >> It just can't get any better
264,00:17:35.17,00:17:35.17,than this. >> Folome?
265,00:17:36.50,00:17:36.50,"Oh, follow you. >> Follow?"
266,00:17:50.73,00:17:50.73,(speaking foreign language) >> Pork?
267,00:17:54.73,00:17:54.73,After we finished our drinks they took us to the Marquesan
268,00:18:00.47,00:18:00.47,oven. There's a ceremony where they
269,00:18:02.47,00:18:02.47,bury food for a certain amount of days.
270,00:18:04.50,00:18:04.50,"That's how they cook their food, underground, with the heat and"
271,00:18:07.30,00:18:07.30,the volcanic rocks. There was a roasted pig under
272,00:18:10.10,00:18:10.10,there with plantains and potatoes and roasted goat.
273,00:18:13.43,00:18:13.43,"Oh, man, look at the... Look at the meat, Pap."
274,00:18:16.50,00:18:16.50,">> Can you believe this? >> The Marquesan people, when"
275,00:18:20.37,00:18:20.37,"they were going through their tribal ritual, I don't know how"
276,00:18:23.90,00:18:23.90,"to put it in words, for me to be here on this island in the South"
277,00:18:27.87,00:18:27.87,"Pacific, with all the history it has, you just have to sit down"
278,00:18:32.13,00:18:32.13,"and comprehend and savor the moment, because this is not"
279,00:18:35.77,00:18:35.77,going to happen again probably in my lifetime.
280,00:18:50.83,00:18:50.83,(speaking in foreign language) >> And then both over here.
281,00:18:57.53,00:18:57.53,">> Oh, man. Oh, man."
282,00:19:03.90,00:19:03.90,">> Heavenly Father, we thank you for this food which we are about"
283,00:19:06.73,00:19:06.73,to receive and Lord we thank you for the Marquesan people and
284,00:19:09.43,00:19:09.43,"their beautiful, rich culture. I thank you for bringing Pappy"
285,00:19:12.33,00:19:12.33,"into my life and I pray this is a life-long friendship, Lord."
286,00:19:15.43,00:19:15.43,"Through your son, Jesus Christ name, we pray. Amen."
287,00:19:17.87,00:19:17.87,>> Amen. >> After having a diet of
288,00:19:30.00,00:19:30.00,"nothing but taro root and shellfish, to have this stuff--"
289,00:19:35.00,00:19:35.00,"unbelievable. I mean, we should have paced"
290,00:19:37.67,00:19:37.67,"ourselves a little more, but we..."
291,00:19:42.20,00:19:42.20,">> I feel like Julius Caesar, man."
292,00:19:44.47,00:19:44.47,">> It's unbelievable. >> The ladies, the ladies, the"
293,00:19:50.47,00:19:50.47,ladies! (singing in native language)
294,00:20:01.10,00:20:01.10,>> This is one of the best fish I've ever eaten in my life.
295,00:20:03.03,00:20:03.03,"While Sean and I were at the feast, the rest of the tribe was"
296,00:20:07.17,00:20:07.17,"probably fixing their dinner, getting things ready, the same"
297,00:20:10.37,00:20:10.37,old crap we've been eating. This is incredible.
298,00:20:14.33,00:20:14.33,"Incredible. >> Well, here we are."
299,00:20:27.30,00:20:27.30,>> It's so much easier having just one meal a day really.
300,00:20:30.13,00:20:30.13,">> Yeah, it sure is. (belching)"
301,00:20:35.40,00:20:35.40,>> Excuse me. That means you enjoyed it.
302,00:20:37.67,00:20:37.67,>> I didn't feel bad for the others because Pappy and I were
303,00:20:40.70,00:20:40.70,smuggling food for them. We had one napkin underneath the
304,00:20:44.27,00:20:44.27,"table and one hand, even though there were eyes on us, we had a"
305,00:20:48.10,00:20:48.10,move where maybe I'd block for him and we'd drop all kind of
306,00:20:51.20,00:20:51.20,"stuff and then ball it up in our napkin, and stuff it in our"
307,00:20:54.03,00:20:54.03,pockets. >> Take this home to my sweet
308,00:20:55.93,00:20:55.93,"thing. I've got a pocket full, man,"
309,00:20:58.43,00:20:58.43,I've got a whole bag full. Sean and I were brought out
310,00:21:04.83,00:21:04.83,into a circle where they danced around us and asked us to dance
311,00:21:08.50,00:21:08.50,"with them. But what really made it funny,"
312,00:21:10.57,00:21:10.57,we had stuffed all kind of food in our pockets before then to
313,00:21:13.57,00:21:13.57,"bring back to camp, and I promise you my pants were at my"
314,00:21:16.23,00:21:16.23,knees most of the dance because the weight of the food was
315,00:21:18.63,00:21:18.63,"causing my pants to fall down. We looked at each other, two"
316,00:21:27.80,00:21:27.80,"guys from different walks of life, 10,000 miles away from"
317,00:21:31.63,00:21:31.63,"home, in paradise, and said, you know this is incredible."
318,00:21:36.50,00:21:36.50,I will never hear another tribal drum beat that I won't think
319,00:21:38.90,00:21:38.90,"about that day, and bring a smile to my face."
320,00:21:48.83,00:21:48.83,>> Thanks. Thank you so much.
321,00:21:51.07,00:21:51.07,(speaking in native language) >> My brothers!
322,00:21:56.43,00:21:56.43,"These Marquesan people, you could tell that the ritual and"
323,00:21:58.70,00:21:58.70,"the dances they were doing were authentic, and you could"
324,00:22:01.00,00:22:01.00,tell that the love they gave us was real.
325,00:22:03.13,00:22:03.13,"Whether we got voted off first, or 9th or 16th."
326,00:22:05.63,00:22:05.63,I don't know what to say. It felt good to get away from
327,00:22:08.23,00:22:08.23,the island and not think about the game and just remember what
328,00:22:11.30,00:22:11.30,"it's like to be a human being. Like that, bam, bam, bam."
329,00:22:25.13,00:22:25.13,I feel the same way. >> We did miss our island
330,00:23:01.03,00:23:01.03,"family. When we came back, the welcome"
331,00:23:02.80,00:23:02.80,"we received was awesome, it was nothing but hugs and kisses."
332,00:23:07.80,00:23:07.80,I think they were happy to see us and once we told them we had
333,00:23:11.03,00:23:11.03,"food, it was on. We took out the food, put it"
334,00:23:13.30,00:23:13.30,"out. I mean, they looked like roaches"
335,00:23:15.13,00:23:15.13,around the table. >> Fish and fish.
336,00:23:17.87,00:23:17.87,">> Oh! Oh, my God. >> Paschal, thank you so much,"
337,00:23:21.97,00:23:21.97,for bringing food back. That is so nice of you guys.
338,00:23:25.50,00:23:25.50,">> Even though they may be the same people who vote you off,"
339,00:23:28.30,00:23:28.30,"there's a human side that you do realize, and it was exciting"
340,00:23:31.37,00:23:31.37,"coming back bringing food for the tribe, because the best"
341,00:23:34.43,00:23:34.43,victories are the ones you can share.
342,00:23:36.60,00:23:36.60,">> Paschal, I'm so proud of you that you smuggled."
343,00:23:37.90,00:23:37.90,You're the best. >> Breakfast is served.
344,00:23:58.93,00:23:58.93,">> Oh, man! >> We're talking a real"
345,00:24:02.70,00:24:02.70,breakfast. Never again will I throw away a
346,00:24:05.30,00:24:05.30,banana. I'll never let one get so ripe
347,00:24:07.83,00:24:07.83,"that I'll throw it away. >> This morning, I felt"
348,00:24:14.13,00:24:14.13,desperate. I felt absolutely desperate.
349,00:24:17.03,00:24:17.03,I was not ready to leave the game.
350,00:24:19.97,00:24:19.97,"I talked to Rob this morning and I said Rob, basically the only"
351,00:24:23.13,00:24:23.13,chance we've got is to see if we can get Paschal and Neleh on our
352,00:24:26.30,00:24:26.30,side. I don't know if it's going to
353,00:24:27.43,00:24:27.43,"happen, but, I said, that's the only chance we have to stay in"
354,00:24:29.33,00:24:29.33,"the game. >> Tammy, make a left so you"
355,00:24:31.67,00:24:31.67,avoid the water. >> Neleh and I were approached
356,00:24:35.27,00:24:35.27,"by Rob and Tammy, and wanted to talk about how the game has"
357,00:24:39.93,00:24:39.93,unraveled. >> Want you to know that when
358,00:24:42.87,00:24:42.87,"John said he was speaking for a group all the time, he wasn't."
359,00:24:47.30,00:24:47.30,">> It was like a final gasp. ""We really weren't in with John."
360,00:24:51.10,00:24:51.10,We didn't know what John was doing.
361,00:24:53.10,00:24:53.10,"He didn't speak for us."" >> No one ever came to me and"
362,00:24:56.27,00:24:56.27,asked me. So I don't want to be held
363,00:24:58.37,00:24:58.37,"accountable for what John said. I'm associated in that group,"
364,00:25:01.70,00:25:01.70,"and no one ever came to me. >> And it was just, it wasn't"
365,00:25:05.80,00:25:05.80,sincere and it just didn't make sense.
366,00:25:09.30,00:25:09.30,">> No one, in the whole period of time, did anything remotely"
367,00:25:14.03,00:25:14.03,"to disassociate yourself with him or to say, ""Hey, John,"
368,00:25:17.37,00:25:17.37,that's your opinion and things may change.
369,00:25:19.90,00:25:19.90,>> We didn't know what he was talking about.
370,00:25:22.23,00:25:22.23,>> He never told us what he said to you.
371,00:25:24.40,00:25:24.40,">> Paschal and Neleh, obviously don't believe everything that"
372,00:25:27.83,00:25:27.83,we're saying. I've never lied and they know
373,00:25:30.67,00:25:30.67,that. I've never lied to them since
374,00:25:33.07,00:25:33.07,day one. You want to believe what you
375,00:25:35.03,00:25:35.03,"want to believe. >> The only thing is, Paschal"
376,00:25:37.23,00:25:37.23,"and I deserve a fair chance at this, too."
377,00:25:39.23,00:25:39.23,">> Bottom line is, sit down. Do you want to be standing next"
378,00:25:42.93,00:25:42.93,to Sean and V. in the end? >> I want to be standing next to
379,00:25:46.40,00:25:46.40,somebody that I really have some confidence that they never told
380,00:25:49.90,00:25:49.90,me anything that was distorted and in order to manipulate me.
381,00:25:53.13,00:25:53.13,">> You can't say that without talking to me, you can't read my"
382,00:25:56.87,00:25:56.87,"mind. If this is what they choose, if"
383,00:25:59.50,00:25:59.50,Neleh and Paschal choose to have Sean or V. standing next to
384,00:26:03.93,00:26:03.93,"them, I'm not going to stand there and beg for anything."
385,00:26:08.03,00:26:08.03,It's a little personal to me and it kind of hurt.
386,00:26:11.67,00:26:11.67,I said what I had to say and that's it.
387,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,That's the end of my business with them.
388,00:26:15.10,00:26:15.10,"Like I said when I'm on the branch just let me know, all"
389,00:26:18.07,00:26:18.07,right? >> Rob got up and walked away
390,00:26:22.00,00:26:22.00,because I guess he feels that we don't trust him and that we
391,00:26:26.67,00:26:26.67,"trust V. and Sean more than we would them and blah, blah, blah."
392,00:26:29.87,00:26:29.87,I think pretty much he just got caught in his own game and so
393,00:26:32.90,00:26:32.90,"now he's just trying to manipulate us a little bit, and"
394,00:26:35.73,00:26:35.73,we're definitely not falling for it.
395,00:26:37.63,00:26:37.63,Rob is definitely pouting right now.
396,00:26:39.80,00:26:39.80,"I mean, maybe he just needs time to think, I don't know, but he's"
397,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43,definitely having a real bad attitude.
398,00:26:45.37,00:26:45.37,">> We're going to go get taro at the waterfall, you want to come?"
399,00:26:48.63,00:26:48.63,>> I got something that I got to do.
400,00:26:50.43,00:26:50.43,>> Yeah? >> People don't like that I'm a
401,00:26:52.73,00:26:52.73,"little grumpy, hey, I don't give a fat ass what you like."
402,00:26:57.30,00:26:57.30,"This is me. You don't like it, I could care"
403,00:27:00.93,00:27:00.93,less. You still got to live with me
404,00:27:02.80,00:27:02.80,"for a couple of days. And if I win immunity, you're"
405,00:27:05.27,00:27:05.27,going to have to live with me for longer than that.
406,00:27:07.70,00:27:07.70,">> The General, to me, is a bull in a china shop."
407,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,He's hard to deal with. He does things only when he
408,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90,"wants. For me, I've had enough of him"
409,00:27:18.33,00:27:18.33,and Tammy. I don't want to cook on the
410,00:27:20.60,00:27:20.60,"green wood, because it takes so long to get going."
411,00:27:23.47,00:27:23.47,>> I'm burning it all in the next four days.
412,00:27:25.60,00:27:25.60,">> What? No, I just don't want to cook on it."
413,00:27:26.97,00:27:26.97,>> I'm just saying I'm burning it all in the next four days.
414,00:27:28.87,00:27:28.87,">> Great, we burn the whole house down."
415,00:27:30.47,00:27:30.47,">> I'm saying, I cut it all, I'm going to burn it all."
416,00:27:32.73,00:27:32.73,">> Cool. To put it blunt, I have no"
417,00:27:36.53,00:27:36.53,intention of sticking with Tammy and Rob.
418,00:27:39.33,00:27:39.33,They weren't people that I trusted from the get-go.
419,00:27:41.90,00:27:41.90,I guess you would say I'm letting people know in little
420,00:27:44.97,00:27:44.97,"ways that I'm no longer part of any alliance, that I'm kind of"
421,00:27:49.17,00:27:49.17,off on my own. So I ended up making some shell
422,00:27:52.63,00:27:52.63,jewelry just so everybody had something.
423,00:27:55.60,00:27:55.60,"I'm still working on a few, trying to fit in here."
424,00:27:58.97,00:27:58.97,">> Oh, how darling. >> Oh, give me a smooch."
425,00:28:04.43,00:28:04.43,Thank you. That is darling.
426,00:28:06.70,00:28:06.70,You're going to get a name as a jeweler out here.
427,00:28:09.60,00:28:09.60,">> Yeah. >> Yeah, that one's cute."
428,00:28:12.90,00:28:12.90,">> Oh, that looks good. >> Zoe is sucking up and making"
429,00:28:19.70,00:28:19.70,"everybody jewelry, because she wants to be their friend and she"
430,00:28:23.47,00:28:23.47,"wants them to like her and she thinks that by them liking her,"
431,00:28:26.60,00:28:26.60,she's not going to get voted out.
432,00:28:28.30,00:28:28.30,">> How about a bracelet, I would love a bracelet, though,"
433,00:28:31.97,00:28:31.97,"actually. >> But you know, the thing is,"
434,00:28:34.10,00:28:34.10,"it's funny, because when Zoe sits there and does these"
435,00:28:36.83,00:28:36.83,"sucking up things, and it's so fake, and it's so apparent"
436,00:28:39.63,00:28:39.63,"that she's being fake, I just don't understand how it's not"
437,00:28:42.73,00:28:42.73,apparent to everybody else. >> You are seriously the most
438,00:28:47.03,00:28:47.03,tender-hearted person. >> We're going to have fun
439,00:28:50.67,00:28:50.67,today. >> Yes.
440,00:28:57.30,00:28:57.30,">> There's mail. >> Oh, my God."
441,00:28:59.03,00:28:59.03,>> There's mail you guys! There's mail here.
442,00:29:01.60,00:29:01.60,">> Stilts. >> Oh, my God."
443,00:29:04.10,00:29:04.10,"""Don't care if you're big, if you're not you'll be taller,"
444,00:29:07.13,00:29:07.13,"maybe strength could help, or be a plus if you're smaller."
445,00:29:12.47,00:29:12.47,"Practice does make perfect, so play with these all day."
446,00:29:15.80,00:29:15.80,"Fail to heed this warning, be the next to go away."""
447,00:29:20.13,00:29:20.13,">> Oh, my God. >> Tree mail for the immunity"
448,00:29:22.33,00:29:22.33,challenge we got some stilts. I'm not sure what it's going to
449,00:29:25.37,00:29:25.37,"be like tomorrow, so we're just going to practice and hope it"
450,00:29:28.27,00:29:28.27,goes good. >> Balance is the key.
451,00:29:43.70,00:29:43.70,">> You know what, it was fun watching everybody practice on"
452,00:29:48.10,00:29:48.10,"those stilts, because they sucked."
453,00:29:50.63,00:29:50.63,">> Oh, man. No good."
454,00:29:54.73,00:29:54.73,>> It didn't look like they were going to get the hang of it.
455,00:29:57.97,00:29:57.97,>> That was my practice. >> The challenge is going to
456,00:30:01.30,00:30:01.30,"make or break me basically. I have to win, or I'll get the"
457,00:30:05.80,00:30:05.80,boot tonight. I actually went down to the
458,00:30:08.73,00:30:08.73,beach like far away where nobody could see me practice.
459,00:30:22.17,00:30:22.17,But I'm not out of it. Not yet.
460,00:30:25.80,00:30:25.80,Not until I hear my name read at Tribal Council.
461,00:30:45.70,00:30:45.70,">> PROBST: First things first, as always, give me that necklace"
462,00:30:49.77,00:30:49.77,back. >> It doesn't want to come off.
463,00:30:52.83,00:30:52.83,">> PROBST: Immunity, back up for grabs."
464,00:30:56.00,00:30:56.00,"Okay. For today's immunity challenge,"
465,00:30:58.50,00:30:58.50,it is Marquesan stilt fighting which is something that is still
466,00:31:01.70,00:31:01.70,practiced out here for fun and entertainment.
467,00:31:03.93,00:31:03.93,"Very simple. Two at a time, you'll enter the"
468,00:31:07.07,00:31:07.07,ring facing each other. First person to fall off is out.
469,00:31:09.87,00:31:09.87,You've randomly picked numbers to decide who will pair off
470,00:31:12.97,00:31:12.97,against whom. We'll work our way through a
471,00:31:15.07,00:31:15.07,series of heats until we are left with one.
472,00:31:17.13,00:31:17.13,"Big stakes, obviously. Right now, it's one in eight."
473,00:31:20.10,00:31:20.10,"Win this, you cannot be voted out tonight."
474,00:31:22.23,00:31:22.23,You're guaranteed a one in seven shot at being the sole Survivor.
475,00:31:26.07,00:31:26.07,"Take your spots, wait for my go. All right."
476,00:31:30.13,00:31:30.13,"First two up. V., General, mount your stilts."
477,00:31:37.07,00:31:37.07,>> This is going to be funny. >> PROBST: I'm going to say
478,00:31:40.23,00:31:40.23,"Survivors ready. You step on with one foot, then"
479,00:31:42.33,00:31:42.33,I'll say go. You have you to have both feet
480,00:31:44.53,00:31:44.53,on. Survivors ready.
481,00:31:46.37,00:31:46.37,"Go. >> Oh, that was close."
482,00:31:53.33,00:31:53.33,>> PROBST: V. wins the first one.
483,00:31:54.40,00:31:54.40,"You're here. General, you're out."
484,00:31:56.30,00:31:56.30,"Next two. Kathy, Paschal."
485,00:31:58.13,00:31:58.13,">> Good luck, guys. >> Good luck, you guys."
486,00:32:01.47,00:32:01.47,>> Pappy! What are we doing?
487,00:32:06.27,00:32:06.27,>> PROBST: Survivors ready. Go!
488,00:32:10.43,00:32:10.43,"That's it. Paschal, moving on!"
489,00:32:15.27,00:32:15.27,"Next two. Tammy, Neleh, let's see if"
490,00:32:20.00,00:32:20.00,somebody can do the impossible and stand on these for more
491,00:32:23.30,00:32:23.30,than a second. Survivors ready.
492,00:32:26.80,00:32:26.80,Go. That's it.
493,00:32:36.73,00:32:36.73,"Tammy moves on, Neleh you're done."
494,00:32:39.03,00:32:39.03,"Good effort, guys. Sean, Zoe."
495,00:32:42.10,00:32:42.10,">> Here we go, boys and girls. Giddy up."
496,00:32:44.50,00:32:44.50,">> PROBST: Sean and Zoe, trying to move on."
497,00:32:47.13,00:32:47.13,Survivors ready. Go.
498,00:32:52.90,00:32:52.90,"Sean, you're out. Zoe moving on."
499,00:32:56.07,00:32:56.07,"General, Kathy, Neleh, Sean, you're out."
500,00:33:01.47,00:33:01.47,"We're down to these four, V., Paschal, you're up first."
501,00:33:04.53,00:33:04.53,">> All right, baby. Here we go."
502,00:33:08.70,00:33:08.70,This is for immunity. Moving on to the next round.
503,00:33:11.80,00:33:11.80,"V. and Paschal, Survivors ready. >> Come on, V., baby,"
504,00:33:15.37,00:33:15.37,concentrate. >> PROBST: Go.
505,00:33:21.17,00:33:21.17,"V., you're in the finals, Paschal, you're out."
506,00:33:24.47,00:33:24.47,"Tammy, Zoe. Winner moves on to the finals."
507,00:33:29.07,00:33:29.07,Survivors ready. Go.
508,00:33:38.30,00:33:38.30,"You all right, Zoe? >> Yes."
509,00:33:40.13,00:33:40.13,">> PROBST: Zoe is out. Tammy, squaring off against V."
510,00:33:46.30,00:33:46.30,">> Good luck, girls. >> What do you think, baby girl?"
511,00:33:50.87,00:33:50.87,">> PROBST: Here we go, for immunity, Tammy and V."
512,00:33:56.27,00:33:56.27,Survivors ready. Go.
513,00:34:10.53,00:34:10.53,"That's it. Tammy, wins immunity again."
514,00:34:13.67,00:34:13.67,">> Yes, yes, yes! >> PROBST: Very much earned."
515,00:34:22.57,00:34:22.57,>> You have no idea how much I needed this.
516,00:34:24.30,00:34:24.30,>> PROBST: You cannot be voted out tonight.
517,00:34:26.10,00:34:26.10,>> Whoo! Yes! >> PROBST: Tammy obviously safe
518,00:34:32.20,00:34:32.20,tonight. Everybody else vulnerable.
519,00:34:34.40,00:34:34.40,"Tribal Council in a few hours. You can head back to camp, I'll"
520,00:34:37.17,00:34:37.17,see you in a while. >> I'm so happy for you.
521,00:34:55.37,00:34:55.37,">> Thanks, Rob. Don't give up, I mean, keep"
522,00:34:57.87,00:34:57.87,thinking positive. It could go either way tonight.
523,00:35:00.27,00:35:00.27,Paschal really likes you. Sean really likes you.
524,00:35:03.60,00:35:03.60,>> That's okay. >> I think the foregone
525,00:35:06.77,00:35:06.77,"conclusion was that Tammy would be voted out, and of course"
526,00:35:10.37,00:35:10.37,"Tammy, since she's won immunity, she can't receive any votes."
527,00:35:13.33,00:35:13.33,"So, you know, the consideration I think is going to be Rob or"
528,00:35:18.27,00:35:18.27,"Zoe. >> You know, between Zoe and"
529,00:35:25.80,00:35:25.80,"Rob, Zoe's just been a hard worker from day one."
530,00:35:28.90,00:35:28.90,I know we need to get rid of her because her chance of winning
531,00:35:32.47,00:35:32.47,immunity over Rob is a lot bigger.
532,00:35:34.43,00:35:34.43,(whistling) But the way Rob's kind of been
533,00:35:39.70,00:35:39.70,"lately, just kind of down and depressed, maybe it will work"
534,00:35:42.57,00:35:42.57,out better that he leaves tonight.
535,00:35:44.37,00:35:44.37,"His attitude has just been horrible, nobody wants to be"
536,00:35:47.90,00:35:47.90,around him any more. >> Cool.
537,00:35:51.37,00:35:51.37,">> I could care less if I'm the next person to go, because I"
538,00:35:53.63,00:35:53.63,know I'll be here to the end on the jury anyway.
539,00:35:55.47,00:35:55.47,"I can accept my fate, as long as everybody else can accept their"
540,00:35:59.60,00:35:59.60,fate when I make my decision in the jury.
541,00:36:25.77,00:36:25.77,>> PROBST: I'll now bring in the first member of the jury.
542,00:36:29.20,00:36:29.20,"John is here merely to observe. He won't be speaking to you, and"
543,00:36:33.07,00:36:33.07,you should not direct any comments to him.
544,00:36:34.90,00:36:34.90,"For a moment, let's just put the vote aside."
545,00:36:38.47,00:36:38.47,"We're 27 days in, I want to get a gauge of what this has been"
546,00:36:42.53,00:36:42.53,"like for you guys. Sean, what's it's been like for"
547,00:36:45.97,00:36:45.97,you? What have been the moments where
548,00:36:47.87,00:36:47.87,"you thought, man, I'm here. I can't believe I'm out here a"
549,00:36:50.77,00:36:50.77,"month living on my own. >> For me personally, it's been"
550,00:36:53.90,00:36:53.90,really difficult not talking to my mom.
551,00:36:56.33,00:36:56.33,"And... it's like, when I won the challenge with Pap, I just think"
552,00:37:06.63,00:37:06.63,everything I accomplished is because of my mom.
553,00:37:10.17,00:37:10.17,"I don't really have a father. So the man I am today, is..."
554,00:37:14.53,00:37:14.53,"See, Jeff, I tell you, man. >> PROBST: General, any"
555,00:37:20.63,00:37:20.63,revelations for you while you've been out here?
556,00:37:23.23,00:37:23.23,">> Yeah, the last three days have been my days of reckoning."
557,00:37:26.33,00:37:26.33,">> PROBST: What do you mean by that, in what sense?"
558,00:37:29.23,00:37:29.23,">> I analyzed myself, and I analyzed the people around me,"
559,00:37:33.53,00:37:33.53,and I've seen changes. I've seen one person who was in
560,00:37:37.67,00:37:37.67,denial of their past actions and alliances and sucking up to the
561,00:37:42.67,00:37:42.67,powers-that-be right now. And I've seen people who have
562,00:37:46.93,00:37:46.93,been looked upon as nobodies become great players in this
563,00:37:51.43,00:37:51.43,"game. I came here with pride, dignity,"
564,00:37:54.23,00:37:54.23,"integrity and a backpack. I leave with another thing, I"
565,00:37:57.67,00:37:57.67,leave with a couple of bonds and a couple of friends and
566,00:38:00.60,00:38:00.60,relationships that I hope will take to the rest of my days.
567,00:38:04.57,00:38:04.57,">> PROBST: Zoe, is there a moment that stands out after 27"
568,00:38:07.87,00:38:07.87,"days on a deeper level? How well you've done, how tough"
569,00:38:11.70,00:38:11.70,"obstacles you've overcome? >> Oh, certainly, certainly is."
570,00:38:16.50,00:38:16.50,"Things have changed, like the way I've conducted myself has"
571,00:38:20.27,00:38:20.27,"been a bit difficult. But other than that, I'm still a"
572,00:38:24.30,00:38:24.30,"play hard, work hard, play hard sort of person."
573,00:38:28.10,00:38:28.10,">> PROBST: All right, it's time to vote."
574,00:38:30.20,00:38:30.20,But first we have this matter of immunity.
575,00:38:32.47,00:38:32.47,"Tammy wearing it, well earned. She can certainly give this"
576,00:38:36.37,00:38:36.37,immunity away to somebody if she chooses to.
577,00:38:38.47,00:38:38.47,Any chance of you giving that up?
578,00:38:40.27,00:38:40.27,">> You know what, there's no chance in hell I'm giving this"
579,00:38:43.10,00:38:43.10,"immunity up. I worked way too hard for it,"
580,00:38:46.20,00:38:46.20,and I know my butt's on the line.
581,00:38:49.00,00:38:49.00,"If I gave it up, I have no doubt that I'd be voted out tonight."
582,00:38:52.77,00:38:52.77,So I'm not giving it up. >> PROBST: All right.
583,00:38:55.17,00:38:55.17,You cannot vote for Tammy. Everybody else is fair game.
584,00:38:57.53,00:38:57.53,"Zoe, you're first. >> I had enough."
585,00:39:29.33,00:39:29.33,>> Maybe this will be my one valuable contribution to the
586,00:39:32.57,00:39:32.57,tribe. >> This is strictly a strategy
587,00:40:01.23,00:40:01.23,move. I'll see you on the other side.
588,00:40:24.77,00:40:24.77,">> Zoe, I'm voting you out tonight, because, well, I just"
589,00:40:29.17,00:40:29.17,don't like you. >> PROBST: I'll go tally the
590,00:40:38.87,00:40:38.87,votes. Once the votes have been read
591,00:40:55.20,00:40:55.20,the decision is final. The person will be asked to
592,00:40:57.50,00:40:57.50,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
593,00:40:59.13,00:40:59.13,"I'll read the votes. First vote, Zoe."
594,00:41:10.33,00:41:10.33,Rob. Zoe.
595,00:41:21.83,00:41:21.83,"Zoe. That's three votes Zoe, one vote"
596,00:41:25.17,00:41:25.17,Rob. Zoe.
597,00:41:30.63,00:41:30.63,Four votes Zoe. Zoe.
598,00:41:36.77,00:41:36.77,"That's five, and that's enough. You need to bring me your torch."
599,00:41:50.03,00:41:50.03,"Zoe, the tribe has spoken. >> Strength and honor."
600,00:41:58.27,00:41:58.27,>> PROBST: It's time for you to go.
601,00:42:11.27,00:42:11.27,"Well, there's no doubt that  Survivor can be very"
602,00:42:15.30,00:42:15.30,"challenging, both physically and mentally."
603,00:42:17.70,00:42:17.70,"But as we saw again tonight, don't ever give up or count"
604,00:42:20.00,00:42:20.00,"yourself out of this game, because you never know how it's"
605,00:42:22.67,00:42:22.67,going to play out. You can head back to camp.
606,00:42:40.50,00:42:40.50,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
607,00:42:46.57,00:42:46.57,>> PROBST: Next time on  Survivor...
608,00:42:47.97,00:42:47.97,"The tribe wakes up hungry, so Kathy sets out for food."
609,00:42:51.00,00:42:51.00,>> I'm going to see if I can whack it.
610,00:42:53.57,00:42:53.57,">> Happy birthday, girlfriend. >> PROBST: Vecepia celebrates"
611,00:42:56.60,00:42:56.60,"her birthday, but it's not exactly a happy one, until the"
612,00:42:59.67,00:42:59.67,tribe learns their next reward is on a cruise ship.
613,00:43:02.80,00:43:02.80,">> Go! >> Well, it was a bit of a"
614,00:43:13.07,00:43:13.07,surprise to be voted off this early.
615,00:43:15.37,00:43:15.37,But I guess that's just the way it goes.
616,00:43:18.97,00:43:18.97,"I did my best, work hard, play hard."
617,00:43:22.47,00:43:22.47,"Zoe is, uh... she's leaving, that's that, I guess."
618,00:43:27.40,00:43:27.40,Sweet dreams to all.
