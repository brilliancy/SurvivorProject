373,00:25:33.07,00:25:33.07,day one.You want to believe what you
374,00:25:35.03,00:25:35.03,"want to believe.>> The only thing is, Paschal"
375,00:25:37.23,00:25:37.23,"and I deserve a fair chance atthis, too."
376,00:25:39.23,00:25:39.23,">> Bottom line is, sit down.Do you want to be standing next"
377,00:25:42.93,00:25:42.93,to Sean and V. in the end?>> I want to be standing next to
378,00:25:46.40,00:25:46.40,somebody that I really have someconfidence that they never told
379,00:25:49.90,00:25:49.90,me anything that was distortedand in order to manipulate me.
380,00:25:53.13,00:25:53.13,">> You can't say that withouttalking to me, you can't read my"
381,00:25:56.87,00:25:56.87,"mind.If this is what they choose, if"
382,00:25:59.50,00:25:59.50,Neleh and Paschal choose to haveSean or V. standing next to
383,00:26:03.93,00:26:03.93,"them, I'm not going to standthere and beg for anything."
384,00:26:08.03,00:26:08.03,It's a little personal to me andit kind of hurt.
385,00:26:11.67,00:26:11.67,I said what I had to say andthat's it.
386,00:26:13.33,00:26:13.33,That's the end of my businesswith them.
387,00:26:15.10,00:26:15.10,"Like I said when I'm on thebranch just let me know, all"
388,00:26:18.07,00:26:18.07,right?>> Rob got up and walked away
389,00:26:22.00,00:26:22.00,because I guess he feels that wedon't trust him and that we
390,00:26:26.67,00:26:26.67,"trust V. and Sean more than wewould them and blah, blah, blah."
391,00:26:29.87,00:26:29.87,I think pretty much he just gotcaught in his own game and so
392,00:26:32.90,00:26:32.90,"now he's just trying tomanipulate us a little bit, and"
393,00:26:35.73,00:26:35.73,we're definitely not falling forit.
394,00:26:37.63,00:26:37.63,Rob is definitely pouting rightnow.
395,00:26:39.80,00:26:39.80,"I mean, maybe he just needs timeto think, I don't know, but he's"
396,00:26:43.43,00:26:43.43,definitely having a real badattitude.
397,00:26:45.37,00:26:45.37,">> We're going to go get taro atthe waterfall, you want to come?"
398,00:26:48.63,00:26:48.63,>> I got something that I got todo.

404,00:27:05.27,00:27:05.27,going to have to live with mefor longer than that.

406,00:27:12.00,00:27:12.00,He's hard to deal with.He does things only when he
407,00:27:15.90,00:27:15.90,"wants.For me, I've had enough of him"
408,00:27:18.33,00:27:18.33,and Tammy.I don't want to cook on the

411,00:27:25.60,00:27:25.60,">> What? No, I just don't wantto cook on it."
412,00:27:26.97,00:27:26.97,>> I'm just saying I'm burningit all in the next four days.
413,00:27:28.87,00:27:28.87,">> Great, we burn the wholehouse down."
414,00:27:30.47,00:27:30.47,">> I'm saying, I cut it all, I'mgoing to burn it all."

416,00:27:36.53,00:27:36.53,intention of sticking with Tammyand Rob.
417,00:27:39.33,00:27:39.33,They weren't people that Itrusted from the get-go.
418,00:27:41.90,00:27:41.90,I guess you would say I'mletting people know in little
419,00:27:44.97,00:27:44.97,"ways that I'm no longer part ofany alliance, that I'm kind of"
420,00:27:49.17,00:27:49.17,off on my own.So I ended up making some shell
421,00:27:52.63,00:27:52.63,jewelry just so everybody hadsomething.
422,00:27:55.60,00:27:55.60,"I'm still working on a few,trying to fit in here."
