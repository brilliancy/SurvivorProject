89,00:04:04.67,00:04:04.67,I THINK WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE...
90,00:04:06.25,00:04:06.25,>> THERE'S A LOT OF TESTOSTERONE OVER THERE.
91,00:04:08.79,00:04:08.79,TYRONE WANTS TO BE IN CONTROL.

106,00:04:39.12,00:04:39.12,THERE'S ONE GUY THAT MAYBE KNOWS A LITTLE BIT.
107,00:04:41.25,00:04:41.25,"JOE PESCI OVER THERE, I THINK,"
108,00:04:42.67,00:04:42.67,KNOWS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONSTRUCTION.
109,00:04:44.67,00:04:44.67,>> WHO THE HELL EVER BUILT A SHELTER BEFORE?
110,00:04:46.46,00:04:46.46,"I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK."
111,00:04:48.38,00:04:48.38,YOU THINK I EVER BUILT A SHELTER?
112,00:04:49.92,00:04:49.92,>> WE'RE GONNA SLEEP ON THAT? >> YEAH.
113,00:04:51.96,00:04:51.96,>> WE CAN'T JUST SLEEP ON THAT.
114,00:04:53.33,00:04:53.33,">> NO, NO, NO, NO. FIVE HOURS, IT'S DAYLIGHT LEFT."
115,00:04:56.25,00:04:56.25,>> OKAY. >> I'M ALL FOR...

117,00:05:04.75,00:05:04.75,AND IT'S A BIT ENTERTAINING.
118,00:05:06.46,00:05:06.46,>> WE MAY END UP KEEPING THIS ROOF.
119,00:05:08.25,00:05:08.25,">> JIMMY T.'S STYLE IS, ""LOOK AT ME!"

122,00:05:15.17,00:05:15.17,'CAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE A CRYING CHILD.

124,00:05:18.46,00:05:18.46,"IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO THAT NONSENSE, THEN THEY'LL STOP."
125,00:05:20.92,00:05:20.92,>> I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING IGNORED BY YOU GUYS.
126,00:05:23.08,00:05:23.08,>> WE CAN WORK WHILE WE TALK.
127,00:05:24.08,00:05:24.08,">> I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE ALL SAYING, WHAT IF..."
128,00:05:26.08,00:05:26.08,ONE GUY GRAB EACH... ONE POLE
129,00:05:27.79,00:05:27.79,AND WE LAY IT UP HERE AND WE GOT OUR STRUCTURE.
130,00:05:30.25,00:05:30.25,">> I HEARD SOME RAH-RAH WITH, UH, JIMMY T. AND THE SHELTER,"
131,00:05:33.83,00:05:33.83,"THERE WAS KIND OF SOME YELLING GOING ON,"
132,00:05:35.79,00:05:35.79,"COUPLE PROFANITIES AS I WALKED BY,"
133,00:05:38.04,00:05:38.04,BUT THE GIRLS ARE DOING GREAT.
134,00:05:39.67,00:05:39.67,"AND WE'RE WEAVING PALM FRONDS, WE'RE OUT GATHERING WOOD."
135,00:05:42.29,00:05:42.29,"THE BOYS HAVE BUILT AND UN-BUILT THE SHELTER,"
136,00:05:44.46,00:05:44.46,"LIKE, FOUR OR FIVE TIMES ALREADY."
137,00:05:46.21,00:05:46.21,SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT FOR US.
138,00:05:48.42,00:05:48.42,">> ONE, TWO, THREE!"
139,00:05:50.08,00:05:50.08,">> GO, GO, GO, GO!"
140,00:05:52.58,00:05:52.58,>> THERE IT IS.
141,00:05:53.62,00:05:53.62,">> ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS GOOD."
142,00:05:55.21,00:05:55.21,ARE WE DONE? CAN I GO HOME?
143,00:06:06.21,00:06:06.21,>> Jeff: THINGS WERE MUCH MORE RELAXED
144,00:06:08.08,00:06:08.08,AT THE YOUNG LA FLOR TRIBE...
145,00:06:09.75,00:06:09.75,>> TIME TO SWIM?

150,00:06:21.83,00:06:21.83,"AS THE YOUNGER TRIBE WE HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE,"
151,00:06:24.12,00:06:24.12,BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY.
152,00:06:26.58,00:06:26.58,ALL OF US ARE FIT.
153,00:06:27.79,00:06:27.79,AND WE'RE ALL SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
154,00:06:30.04,00:06:30.04,UNDERWEAR! WHOO! THOSE ARE CUTE!
155,00:06:33.79,00:06:33.79,AND I THINK THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE
156,00:06:35.25,00:06:35.25,IS THAT WE'RE GETTING ALONG SO WELL.
157,00:06:37.25,00:06:37.25,WE'RE IN NICARAGUA.
158,00:06:39.12,00:06:39.12,>> I AM REALLY HAPPY THAT I'M ON THE YOUNGER TRIBE.
159,00:06:41.83,00:06:41.83,WE'RE NOT REALLY SET IN OUR WAYS.

161,00:06:45.21,00:06:45.21,THEY'RE ALREADY SET IN THEIR WAYS.
162,00:06:46.33,00:06:46.33,"THEY THINK THAT THEY KNOW EVERYTHING,"
163,00:06:48.04,00:06:48.04,AND IT'S GONNA BE A LOT HARDER FOR THEM TO BOND AND CLICK.
164,00:06:51.38,00:06:51.38,">> THE LA FLOR TRIBE JUST WANTS TO BE IN THE WATER, AND..."
165,00:06:54.79,00:06:54.79,I'M WITH A BUNCH OF IDIOTS.
166,00:06:56.29,00:06:56.29,"I WISH THAT I HAD BEEN ON THE OTHER TRIBE,"
167,00:06:59.67,00:06:59.67,BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT SMARTER.
168,00:07:01.25,00:07:01.25,I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD A SHELTER.
169,00:07:03.12,00:07:03.12,"I BELIEVE THEY HAD A DOOR, PROBABLY A FEW WINDOWS,"
170,00:07:06.21,00:07:06.21,"A BASEMENT AND ATTIC, BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE WOMEN"
171,00:07:08.79,00:07:08.79,"WERE SITTING UP THERE WEAVING, WEAVING, WEAVING."
172,00:07:11.21,00:07:11.21,I KNOW IT. THEY DO HAVE WISDOM.
173,00:07:13.25,00:07:13.25,I'M WITH YOUNG IDIOTS.
174,00:07:15.21,00:07:15.21,IT'S RIDICULOUS. IT'S RIDICULOUS.
175,00:07:22.04,00:07:22.04,">> HEY, DO YOU NEED ANOTHER VINE?"
176,00:07:23.83,00:07:23.83,">> NOT AT THE MOMENT, BUT MAYBE EVENTUALLY."
177,00:07:25.79,00:07:25.79,">> Jeff: BY NIGHTFALL AT ESPADA,"
178,00:07:27.46,00:07:27.46,"THE TRIBE HAD BUILT SOME CAMARADERIE,"
179,00:07:29.42,00:07:29.42,ALONG WITH THEIR SHELTER.
180,00:07:30.88,00:07:30.88,">> TIE THIS ONE FIRST, AND THEN I'LL PUT MY HAND"

184,00:07:39.46,00:07:39.46,">> THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? >> THANK YOU, DOCTOR."
185,00:07:42.12,00:07:42.12,I GOT A LITTLE UPSET WITH SOME GUYS EARLIER.
186,00:07:44.29,00:07:44.29,">> OH, HERE, THERE'S A BUNCH RIGHT HERE."
187,00:07:45.62,00:07:45.62,>> MAYBE THEY JUST WEREN'T
188,00:07:46.75,00:07:46.75,ELOQUENT IN THE WAY THEY SPOKE TO ME.
189,00:07:48.29,00:07:48.29,BUT GUESS WHAT? I LIKE THE WAY GUYS ARE STARTING TO STEP UP.
190,00:07:51.33,00:07:51.33,I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO UNITE AS A TEAM.
191,00:07:53.50,00:07:53.50,I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.
192,00:07:54.50,00:07:54.50,">> GET IT IN, GET IT IN."
193,00:07:55.79,00:07:55.79,>> IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.

585,00:26:38.12,00:26:38.12,"BUT WHO KNOWS, I COULD BE SCREWED TONIGHT."
586,00:26:40.29,00:26:40.29,THEY MAY BE PLAYING A GAME WITH ME AND I'M GONE.

593,00:26:57.21,00:26:57.21,BECAUSE HE'S AN EASY NUMBER BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE'S WEAK
594,00:26:59.79,00:26:59.79,"AND HE'S HAPPY THAT WE KEEP HIM AROUND,"
595,00:27:01.79,00:27:01.79,SO HE'S GONNA BE LOYAL TO US.

746,00:33:18.04,00:33:18.04,I DID GRAB THE FLOUR.
747,00:33:19.71,00:33:19.71,AND MY PURPOSE FOR GRABBING THE FLOUR WAS TO MEASURE IT OUT
748,00:33:22.33,00:33:22.33,TO PUT HALF AND HALF

756,00:33:38.79,00:33:38.79,THAT'S FOR SURE.
757,00:33:40.38,00:33:40.38,LET'S GO GET IT AND BRING IT HERE.

768,00:34:11.29,00:34:11.29,I AM SO PISSED OFF AT NAONKA.
769,00:34:14.96,00:34:14.96,SHE IS WAY TOO EMOTIONAL TO HAVE AS A CORE ALLIANCE.
770,00:34:18.25,00:34:18.25,IT REALLY MADE ME QUESTION HER INTELLIGENCE
771,00:34:21.92,00:34:21.92,AND REALLY WHERE HER FOCUS IS ON THE GAME.
772,00:34:24.33,00:34:24.33,SHE MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST PERSON TO GO TO THE END WITH.
773,00:34:27.21,00:34:27.21,WHERE'S THE FLOUR? IT'S AT A TREE?
