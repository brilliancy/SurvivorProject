6,00:00:11.63,00:00:11.63,members suspected Neleh was not all she seemed.
7,00:00:13.93,00:00:13.93,">> She's playing sweet, little girl next door, and before you"
8,00:00:16.37,00:00:16.37,"know it, ""Hey, I'm in the finals and I'm so happy, oh, God, oh"

10,00:00:24.57,00:00:24.57,were concerned about their chances for staying in the game.
11,00:00:27.57,00:00:27.57,">> I catch a pig, you win immunity."
12,00:00:29.80,00:00:29.80,"Look, she's immune-- you got to keep me, I got pig."
13,00:00:33.33,00:00:33.33,>> PROBST: But instead it was the general who won immunity...
14,00:00:35.50,00:00:35.50,>> Sanctuary. >> PROBST: ...leaving Tammy
15,00:00:38.03,00:00:38.03,vulnerable and she was voted out at Tribal Council.
16,00:00:40.67,00:00:40.67,"Tammy, the tribe has spoken. Six are left."
17,00:00:46.00,00:00:46.00,Who will be voted out tonight? (thunder rumbles)

19,00:02:28.13,00:02:28.13,">> The mood is, there's a lot of anxiety because the time has"
20,00:02:31.10,00:02:31.10,"been very long, and everyone's feeling depleted."
21,00:02:34.80,00:02:34.80,"We're just depleted energy-wise, you can feel it."
22,00:02:37.93,00:02:37.93,"Then everybody, just over the past two three days has been"
23,00:02:41.43,00:02:41.43,"talking about missing home, moms, wives, boyfriends."
24,00:02:45.90,00:02:45.90,So it's getting really old. And I was good about it even up
25,00:02:52.70,00:02:52.70,until like I'm here three days ago.
26,00:02:55.17,00:02:55.17,"And I wake up now and I have no idea, I'm sobbing in the morning"
27,00:02:59.07,00:02:59.07,"under the stars, it's weird. Because I know he's fine."
28,00:03:02.93,00:03:02.93,My son is fine. He thinks it's great.
29,00:03:05.73,00:03:05.73,"You know, his mom is out here in the jungle, trying to do this"
30,00:03:07.80,00:03:07.80,game. But it's just really uncanny to
31,00:03:13.37,00:03:13.37,see what's happening with our mental stability.
32,00:03:18.60,00:03:18.60,>> We need something on the other side.
33,00:03:20.97,00:03:20.97,>> You know what? Slide some of it that way.
34,00:03:22.33,00:03:22.33,"Yeah, like that. >> Whoa!"
35,00:03:25.17,00:03:25.17,">> Oh, Sean. >> I got you."
36,00:03:30.47,00:03:30.47,"Just let go. >> The people in our lives here,"
37,00:03:36.73,00:03:36.73,"we're spending 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with some of these"
38,00:03:40.90,00:03:40.90,"people. You pick up a new family, and if"
39,00:03:42.83,00:03:42.83,"you do the math, you're spending probably 900 plus hours with,"
40,00:03:47.20,00:03:47.20,"intense hours, with a lot of individuals that you've never"
41,00:03:51.57,00:03:51.57,known. But by the end of that 900
42,00:03:54.27,00:03:54.27,"hours, you know them probably better than anybody in your life"
43,00:03:57.47,00:03:57.47,"other than your immediate family, certainly better than"
44,00:04:00.53,00:04:00.53,"your best friends, because if you were with your best friends"
45,00:04:02.87,00:04:02.87,"a couple hours a week, which most of us are because of our"
46,00:04:06.47,00:04:06.47,"jobs, won't allow us to do any more than that, you know, how"
47,00:04:09.23,00:04:09.23,many years does it take to collect 900 hours?
48,00:04:15.23,00:04:15.23,>> We were eating the taro root and V and I and Sean almost
49,00:04:18.90,00:04:18.90,"simultaneously, our mouths just started burning like we had cuts"
50,00:04:21.57,00:04:21.57,and sores. So I don't know what happened.
51,00:04:24.50,00:04:24.50,All I know is I'm not eating taro any more.
52,00:04:27.93,00:04:27.93,">> Okay, now lift up your tongue."
53,00:04:30.87,00:04:30.87,No blisters. I just want to make sure there
54,00:04:32.97,00:04:32.97,weren't icky blisters forming. >> It's really weird to miss
55,00:04:37.23,00:04:37.23,home so much and then have this family here and then you're
56,00:04:39.90,00:04:39.90,"going to go back home where you really want to be, and I know"
57,00:04:42.57,00:04:42.57,"what's going to happen. You know, we're going to miss"
58,00:04:45.00,00:04:45.00,the others. >> I got to think about what I'm
59,00:04:50.53,00:04:50.53,"doing out here, and I'm out here to win this game right now, and"
60,00:04:54.47,00:04:54.47,I just cannot focus on my family and fall into depression like
61,00:04:59.47,00:04:59.47,"other people are doing. You know, thinking about their"
62,00:05:01.97,00:05:01.97,"mom, thinking about their wives and husbands and sons and"
63,00:05:04.37,00:05:04.37,daughters. I got to think about what I'm
64,00:05:06.53,00:05:06.53,doing out here. I'm out here to win this game
65,00:05:08.57,00:05:08.57,"right now, and that's it. >> Whoo!"
66,00:05:17.90,00:05:17.90,>> I'll open. >> Make it good.
67,00:05:20.33,00:05:20.33,>> Look at this thing. A turtle?
68,00:05:24.23,00:05:24.23,What? >> Slow.
69,00:05:28.20,00:05:28.20,">> ""Each step you take can decide your fate."
70,00:05:31.93,00:05:31.93,"Which way to go, or should you wait?"
71,00:05:35.57,00:05:35.57,"""It's all strategy now to get to the end."
72,00:05:38.53,00:05:38.53,"""Big night for the winner, choose just one friend."""
73,00:05:43.13,00:05:43.13,>> I've got no clue. >> Even though I'm exhausted and
74,00:05:46.47,00:05:46.47,"sick of this place, this is fun. >> PROBST: Okay."
75,00:05:59.63,00:05:59.63,We are now entering our second month out here.
76,00:06:02.93,00:06:02.93,Day 31. And there's one thing that's
77,00:06:05.53,00:06:05.53,become very clear is you guys are missing the people who
78,00:06:08.90,00:06:08.90,matter the most to you in your lives.
79,00:06:11.07,00:06:11.07,So I'm just wondering how you would react if I offered you a
80,00:06:13.57,00:06:13.57,"phone call home. >> Hell, yeah."
81,00:06:18.13,00:06:18.13,">> PROBST: It's not going to happen today, I was just curious"
82,00:06:19.50,00:06:19.50,"how you'd react. >> Oh, my God, that's cruel."
83,00:06:21.87,00:06:21.87,">> Love you, too, Jeff. >> We're about to do you one"
84,00:06:23.53,00:06:23.53,"better. >> PROBST: Neleh, here's your"
85,00:06:25.80,00:06:25.80,"mom, Rebecca. >> Hey!"
86,00:06:29.70,00:06:29.70,"Way to go girl! We're so proud of you, we love"
87,00:06:32.27,00:06:32.27,"you so much. Just keep going, babes."
88,00:06:36.50,00:06:36.50,">> PROBST: Kathy, it's your son, Pat."
89,00:06:38.57,00:06:38.57,>> Mama! (Kathy sobbing)
90,00:06:47.43,00:06:47.43,">> PROBST: General, say hey to your sister, Diana."
91,00:06:50.70,00:06:50.70,">> Hey, Rob! >> Told you I I'd got you out of"
92,00:06:52.83,00:06:52.83,Maryland some day. >> You were right.
93,00:06:55.43,00:06:55.43,">> PROBST: Sean, it's your buddy Darren."
94,00:06:58.37,00:06:58.37,">> Big Sean! >> PROBST: V, your husband,"
95,00:07:05.23,00:07:05.23,"Leander. >> What's up, baby?!"
96,00:07:11.97,00:07:11.97,">> PROBST: And, Paschal, your lovely wife, Beverly."
97,00:07:14.50,00:07:14.50,">> Hey there! We're all great, don't you worry"
98,00:07:17.63,00:07:17.63,about it. You stay focused and stay here.
99,00:07:21.50,00:07:21.50,I love you! I love you.
100,00:07:28.60,00:07:28.60,">> PROBST: All right, guys, your loved ones traveled a long"
101,00:07:30.83,00:07:30.83,way to be present for this challenge.
102,00:07:33.47,00:07:33.47,Let's do it. Each person will start on one
103,00:07:35.37,00:07:35.37,"piece of the puzzle. When it's your turn, you'll step"
104,00:07:38.33,00:07:38.33,"off that piece onto another piece of the puzzle, flipping"
105,00:07:41.57,00:07:41.57,"over the piece that you were just on, revealing green, and"
106,00:07:43.93,00:07:43.93,green is the reminder you can never step back on that piece.
107,00:07:48.60,00:07:48.60,Once you're boxed in with green all around you and you can move
108,00:07:51.53,00:07:51.53,"no more, you're out of the game. The last person standing on this"
109,00:07:55.67,00:07:55.67,board wins. Obviously this is a game about
110,00:07:58.43,00:07:58.43,"strategy. You're not playing, you're the"
111,00:08:01.03,00:08:01.03,spectator. You guys will be playing.
112,00:08:03.57,00:08:03.57,">> Oh, my God. >> Patrick!"
113,00:08:05.97,00:08:05.97,">> Oh, baby. >> Yes, Patrick!"
114,00:08:09.40,00:08:09.40,">> Come on, Le! >> Baby!"
115,00:08:12.97,00:08:12.97,>> PROBST: Here are the rules you need to know.
116,00:08:14.80,00:08:14.80,"There are six skip-a-turns. If you decide, when it's your"
117,00:08:17.13,00:08:17.13,"turn to step onto one of those, on your next turn you won't"
118,00:08:20.00,00:08:20.00,move. That could be a good move or a
119,00:08:22.10,00:08:22.10,"bad move, depends what everybody else does in game."
120,00:08:25.23,00:08:25.23,There's also one wild card; you won't know you've stepped on a
121,00:08:27.80,00:08:27.80,wild card until you've turned it over.
122,00:08:29.93,00:08:29.93,"When you turn it over, you'll reveal, ""vote one person out,"""
123,00:08:33.00,00:08:33.00,that means you will have to vote another loved one out of the
124,00:08:35.47,00:08:35.47,"game. Final rule, absolutely no verbal"
125,00:08:38.93,00:08:38.93,communication or help between Survivors and loved ones.
126,00:08:43.43,00:08:43.43,Nonverbal communication is fine. As we always do in every
127,00:08:47.07,00:08:47.07," Survivor challenge, we will draw numbers to determine the"
128,00:08:49.07,00:08:49.07,"order in which you will start, so that it's random."
129,00:08:52.53,00:08:52.53,"Let's begin. All right, guys, we're going to"
130,00:08:55.93,00:08:55.93,"start. Pat, you go first."
131,00:09:02.23,00:09:02.23,>> PROBST: Diana. Leander.

133,00:09:22.87,00:09:22.87,Beverly. Remember it's okay to
134,00:09:24.70,00:09:24.70,"communicate non-verbally. If you want to look for help,"
135,00:09:27.50,00:09:27.50,that's fine. Getting really bunched up in the
136,00:09:43.33,00:09:43.33,middle. Still got some room over there
137,00:09:47.20,00:09:47.20,to maneuver. Becky.
138,00:09:54.27,00:09:54.27,Goes on the retreat. Strategy very important at this

148,00:10:44.67,00:10:44.67,>> Be strong. >> Okay.
149,00:10:45.83,00:10:45.83,>> I love you. >> Bye-bye.
150,00:10:46.93,00:10:46.93,>> I love you. >> Love you.

156,00:11:17.77,00:11:17.77,Okay. You have to vote another loved
157,00:11:19.67,00:11:19.67,one out of this game. Obviously you don't have any
158,00:11:22.77,00:11:22.77,"axes to grind, you don't even know these people."
159,00:11:25.93,00:11:25.93,"Part of Survivor, you don't have a choice."
160,00:11:27.90,00:11:27.90,You can base it on strategy. You can pick a number in your
161,00:11:29.97,00:11:29.97,"head between one and ten, doesn't matter to me."
162,00:11:31.83,00:11:31.83,One of these other four is about to be out of the game.
163,00:11:41.30,00:11:41.30,"Leander, you're out. That was a pretty fair way to do"
164,00:11:45.60,00:11:45.60,it. It's a tough break of the game.
165,00:11:49.60,00:11:49.60,"Leander, I'm sorry, come on down here."
166,00:11:53.70,00:11:53.70,"Let's go, V, come on over. >> I'm sorry."

192,00:14:42.00,00:14:42.00,Diana. It can't get any closer than
193,00:14:44.17,00:14:44.17,this. Pat.
194,00:14:47.43,00:14:47.43,Look at that. One piece of the puzzle is all
195,00:14:50.60,00:14:50.60,"that separated the two of you. Okay, even though you both have"
196,00:14:53.90,00:14:53.90,"nowhere to go, Diana it's your turn to move."
197,00:14:57.13,00:14:57.13,You're already boxed in. Come on over here.
198,00:15:02.47,00:15:02.47,"Well played, obviously. >> I'm sorry."
199,00:15:08.77,00:15:08.77,I'm so... You're doing so good.
200,00:15:12.27,00:15:12.27,You really are. I'm so proud of you.
201,00:15:16.57,00:15:16.57,"All right, Robby, you take care. Bring it on home."
202,00:15:27.13,00:15:27.13,Kathy get out here and say hi to Pat.
203,00:15:30.43,00:15:30.43,(cheering) (Kathy screaming gleefully)
204,00:15:35.43,00:15:35.43,>> You did such a good job. I miss you so much.
205,00:15:42.90,00:15:42.90,">> PROBST: Here's how it's going to work, Kathy."
206,00:15:45.70,00:15:45.70,"You're going to hang out with Pat, have some lunch, do a"
207,00:15:47.53,00:15:47.53,"little catch-up, give him an idea of what this world is like,"
208,00:15:51.07,00:15:51.07,maybe have some dinner. You'll be together tonight and
209,00:15:53.40,00:15:53.40,you'll wake up in the morning. Welcome your new tribe member.
210,00:15:56.73,00:15:56.73,"Soliantu, you can head back to camp with them."
211,00:15:58.90,00:15:58.90,>> All right. (cheering)
212,00:16:02.33,00:16:02.33,">> Pat, for one night, you're a member of Soliantu."
213,00:16:05.93,00:16:05.93,">> All right! >> PROBST: Guys, take him back"
214,00:16:09.77,00:16:09.77,to camp. (laughter)
215,00:16:24.67,00:16:24.67,">> Oh, God, isn't this fun! I've got such renewed energy!"
216,00:16:28.43,00:16:28.43,Thank God you're here. I think I can make to it the
217,00:16:31.17,00:16:31.17,"end. Because it has not been easy,"
218,00:16:34.50,00:16:34.50,and it's all very real. >> Yeah.
219,00:16:36.97,00:16:36.97,">> Having my son here was a true lift, and the love coming out of"
220,00:16:39.10,00:16:39.10,my heart just having him here. You're so casual!
221,00:16:43.23,00:16:43.23,You don't understand! We don't have any rap music out
222,00:16:46.97,00:16:46.97,"here, baby. >> I had so much I wanted to ask"
223,00:16:50.70,00:16:50.70,him. >> I forgot to ask him about if
224,00:16:52.67,00:16:52.67,they won the national championship.
225,00:16:55.30,00:16:55.30,>> Damn. >> I was so overwhelmed with
226,00:16:57.47,00:16:57.47,emotion. >> This is the most incredible
227,00:17:00.20,00:17:00.20,"experience of my entire life. Ever, ever, ever."
228,00:17:05.17,00:17:05.17,>> I'm ordering him around like a mother.
229,00:17:07.83,00:17:07.83,">> She's our mother out here, just so you know."
230,00:17:09.77,00:17:09.77,>> Your mama is awesome. >> What are you doing?
231,00:17:12.47,00:17:12.47,">> I'm just looking at you, I got to check you out."
232,00:17:14.70,00:17:14.70,"Have you been lifting? Look, check it out."
233,00:17:17.27,00:17:17.27,It's Irish. I was ripped when he did it.
234,00:17:20.83,00:17:20.83,How is the house? Have you been partying there?
235,00:17:22.87,00:17:22.87,"Seriously, tell me the truth. >> No, not at all."
236,00:17:24.57,00:17:24.57,">> Yes, you have, I can tell. >> Come on, Patrick, you wrecked"
237,00:17:26.67,00:17:26.67,"the joint already. >> Good, yeah."
238,00:17:29.47,00:17:29.47,>> Yes! I can't believe you're here!
239,00:17:31.53,00:17:31.53,"This is so weird. >> You know, Pat's had some good"
240,00:17:34.30,00:17:34.30,"experiences in life, but he basically hangs around New"
241,00:17:37.27,00:17:37.27,England. We're going to make Patrick get
242,00:17:39.80,00:17:39.80,the taro. >> That's right.
243,00:17:42.00,00:17:42.00,>> We're going to make him crush the troka.
244,00:17:44.83,00:17:44.83,>> And we're making Patrick crush all the troka.
245,00:17:48.57,00:17:48.57,">> I get a break. >> Now, the key is just to do"
246,00:17:51.47,00:17:51.47,"whatever you want, drop it. >> Is it hard to smash?"
247,00:17:54.53,00:17:54.53,>> Big Rob just lets it drop a little lower.
248,00:17:56.53,00:17:56.53,>> You let the rock do a lot of the work.
249,00:17:59.47,00:17:59.47,>> Yeah. (laughing)
250,00:18:03.63,00:18:03.63,>> You might want to hang onto it?
251,00:18:05.37,00:18:05.37,">> Oh, I got you. Yeah, that's fine."
252,00:18:06.90,00:18:06.90,(laughter) >> Oh...
253,00:18:18.37,00:18:18.37,>> Give it an umph. Everything is fine with money?
254,00:18:23.27,00:18:23.27,>> Yeah. >> Good job!
255,00:18:27.20,00:18:27.20,>> Good job! >> Can you believe it?
256,00:18:29.30,00:18:29.30,We eat that. Look at this boy!
257,00:18:39.63,00:18:39.63,>> Eww. (laughter)
258,00:18:44.07,00:18:44.07,>> I've never been an outdoor person.
259,00:18:45.33,00:18:45.33,I've been the preppy little kid from the East Coast.
260,00:18:48.27,00:18:48.27,"I like my TV and my couch, coming out here, it's just like"
261,00:18:50.70,00:18:50.70,"wow, it's a whole another word. >> It's so good to have you"
262,00:18:54.80,00:18:54.80,here. Can I go home?
263,00:18:55.87,00:18:55.87,Not yet. >> Your first flavor of Mom's
264,00:19:02.87,00:19:02.87,porridge. >> Nasty food.
265,00:19:11.60,00:19:11.60,>> If you swallow it with an apple it's not too bad.
266,00:19:14.80,00:19:14.80,>> It's really not good. I give them credit for eating it
267,00:19:17.60,00:19:17.60,"every day. >> Patrick and I, we went into"
268,00:19:30.27,00:19:30.27,the jungle and we were harvesting taro for our dinner.
269,00:19:34.47,00:19:34.47,"Oh, that's a great one! That is the joy that we get when"
270,00:19:37.67,00:19:37.67,we find good roots. You look like a natural!
271,00:19:40.67,00:19:40.67,">> Yeah. I'm a real natural. It was muddy and disgusting, got"
272,00:19:44.60,00:19:44.60,my hands all dirty which I usually don't do.
273,00:19:47.23,00:19:47.23,I'm usually a pretty boy. I don't know what my buddies are
274,00:19:49.33,00:19:49.33,going to think. They'll think I'm crazy.
275,00:19:51.77,00:19:51.77,They'll think my mother is crazy.
276,00:19:54.93,00:19:54.93,You're crazy. >> Am I crazy?
277,00:19:56.73,00:19:56.73,>> Yes. >> I'm not crazy!
278,00:20:00.23,00:20:00.23,>> Everybody got something out of that.
279,00:20:02.23,00:20:02.23,I am so glad. >> I am so happy.
280,00:20:04.07,00:20:04.07,">> Yeah, everybody did, Pap. >> Doesn't it feel so good to"
281,00:20:05.97,00:20:05.97,kiss Beverly? When I saw Leander for the first
282,00:20:09.57,00:20:09.57,"time, I wanted to touch him to make sure he was real, and there"
283,00:20:13.23,00:20:13.23,was so much going on and he was just smiling and looking so...
284,00:20:17.33,00:20:17.33,scrumptious. Looking so good!
285,00:20:22.97,00:20:22.97,"And I just, I was just so elated."
286,00:20:26.23,00:20:26.23,">> Man, all I can do is keep seeing him walking out of there."
287,00:20:29.77,00:20:29.77,">> I'm like, ""Mom, concentrate."" I know that she was so excited"
288,00:20:31.97,00:20:31.97,that she wasn't listening to his directions.
289,00:20:34.10,00:20:34.10,">> He told me everybody, all my boys, all my family are praying"
290,00:20:36.07,00:20:36.07,"for me. >> It was, you know, home being"
291,00:20:38.90,00:20:38.90,brought to each one of us. >> I just told my sister how
292,00:20:42.47,00:20:42.47,much I loved her. >> I guess it's just human
293,00:20:45.17,00:20:45.17,nature. Once you get towards the end of
294,00:20:47.40,00:20:47.40,"something like this, your intensity of your thoughts of"
295,00:20:49.77,00:20:49.77,home are really more acute than ever.
296,00:20:53.17,00:20:53.17,It's really a wonderful opportunity that I've had to
297,00:20:55.20,00:20:55.20,"come out here and, you know, I'm 57 years old and for the first"
298,00:20:58.47,00:20:58.47,"time in my life, I have come face-to-face with myself."
299,00:21:02.17,00:21:02.17,"And, um... some of the things I've seen"
300,00:21:05.33,00:21:05.33,"and reflect on, I'm not real proud about."
301,00:21:09.47,00:21:09.47,"How much I take for granted, and, you know, what a wonderful"
302,00:21:12.07,00:21:12.07,"situation I have and a wonderful wife, and, you know, I'm"
303,00:21:14.90,00:21:14.90,determined when I go back home that a lot of that is going to
304,00:21:18.23,00:21:18.23,change. We're the most blessed nation in
305,00:21:22.00,00:21:22.00,the world. We just take so much
306,00:21:24.50,00:21:24.50,"for granted, and it takes an experience like this to realize"
307,00:21:26.53,00:21:26.53,"what you can really do without, and what really is important in"
308,00:21:30.30,00:21:30.30,your life. And it's not a fancy car and
309,00:21:32.37,00:21:32.37,it's not the number of TVs you have and it's not your bank
310,00:21:34.83,00:21:34.83,account and it's not the clothes you wear.
311,00:21:36.97,00:21:36.97,"It's, it's the people in your life."
312,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,">> Being out here, I've really learned not to take the small"
313,00:21:44.07,00:21:44.07,"things of life for granted. I mean, there are so many times"
314,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,where you buy a loaf of bread and you got three little pieces
315,00:21:51.77,00:21:51.77,"and the ends left, ""Oh, we don't need these"" and toss them in the"
316,00:21:55.77,00:21:55.77,garbage can. To be out here knowing that we
317,00:21:58.60,00:21:58.60,are scraping the last bit of food out of a coconut husk makes
318,00:22:03.83,00:22:03.83,me realize that going home I need to think twice about what
319,00:22:06.77,00:22:06.77,I'm doing. >> I need your help.
320,00:22:13.73,00:22:13.73,What I need help on is the game. And I have to tell you
321,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97,something. I respect how you play games.
322,00:22:19.87,00:22:19.87,"So here I am, I have this loyalty to Paschal and Neleh."
323,00:22:23.20,00:22:23.20,"Well, Paschal and Neleh are like father and daughter, you've seen"
324,00:22:24.90,00:22:24.90,them together. >> Yeah.
325,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,>> You can feel it. So if we get down to the final
326,00:22:27.93,00:22:27.93,"three, Pascal and Neleh are voting me off."
327,00:22:30.47,00:22:30.47,Unless I get immunity. So how do I get in the game?
328,00:22:34.90,00:22:34.90,Because they're going to boot me.
329,00:22:36.77,00:22:36.77,So the way to get back in the game is sort of right now...
330,00:22:38.90,00:22:38.90,>> Vote with Sean and V. >> But if I end up in the final
331,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,"three with Sean and V, they'll vote me out."
332,00:22:44.17,00:22:44.17,"So the key player here is Rob, I have to make a decision to go to"
333,00:22:47.63,00:22:47.63,"Rob, V. and Sean. Do I go to those three people"
334,00:22:52.87,00:22:52.87,and form an alliance of four against Paschal and Neleh and
335,00:22:56.27,00:22:56.27,look like a total... >> Bitch.
336,00:22:58.33,00:22:58.33,>> ...bitch. Help me.
337,00:23:03.03,00:23:03.03,>> You've got to hope that Rob gets immunity.
338,00:23:06.03,00:23:06.03,"That's about it. >> No, I'm saying I could form"
339,00:23:07.80,00:23:07.80,"the alliance today, before the challenge."
340,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,All of this is seductive and cunning and it's not like me.
341,00:23:16.93,00:23:16.93,">> Yes, I don't like this side of you."
342,00:23:19.67,00:23:19.67,>> But that's what the game does to you.
343,00:23:21.27,00:23:21.27,">> I know. >> All of a sudden, I'm just"
344,00:23:22.83,00:23:22.83,trying to play the game. So what do I do?
345,00:23:24.30,00:23:24.30,">> I don't know, I never played a game like this before."
346,00:23:26.70,00:23:26.70,">> You got to help me though. I got my family here, my most"
347,00:23:28.77,00:23:28.77,trusted ally. >> It's messed up-- the
348,00:23:31.77,00:23:31.77,situation they put you in. >> It is messed up.
349,00:23:34.77,00:23:34.77,"If I won the million bucks now, if I were to form this"
350,00:23:36.73,00:23:36.73,"alliance of four...? Patrick, I'm so proud of you."
351,00:23:46.73,00:23:46.73,You looked so good up on that game board.
352,00:23:48.97,00:23:48.97,">> You did. >> What's your favorite meal,"
353,00:23:50.50,00:23:50.50,Patrick? Let's talk about something we
354,00:23:52.10,00:23:52.10,all love talking about. >> Favorite meal?
355,00:23:56.83,00:23:56.83,Cheeseburgers. >> Cheeseburger?
356,00:24:00.47,00:24:00.47,>> I love cheeseburgers. >> What's your favorite dessert?
357,00:24:05.37,00:24:05.37,>> Tumbleweed. >> What's that?
358,00:24:06.80,00:24:06.80,">> What's Tumbleweed? >> A bed strawberries, take a"
359,00:24:09.57,00:24:09.57,"clump of vanilla ice cream, roll it in coconut."
360,00:24:14.20,00:24:14.20,">> Oh, you just ruined it, man. You just ruined it!"
361,00:24:16.80,00:24:16.80,>> He mentioned coconut! >> Pick a different dessert.
362,00:24:25.03,00:24:25.03,>> What's your second favorite dessert?
363,00:24:43.43,00:24:43.43,>> I slept terrible last night. Slept on that... grass.
364,00:24:47.57,00:24:47.57,It wasn't very comfortable. But I slept a little.
365,00:24:52.40,00:24:52.40,I'm glad I can sleep in a bed tonight.
366,00:24:56.03,00:24:56.03,>> Patio... Do you have to go home?
367,00:25:00.60,00:25:00.60,">> Yes. I'd love to stay, but..."
368,00:25:04.20,00:25:04.20,"Actually, no I'm not interested in staying for another 24 hours."
369,00:25:06.93,00:25:06.93,>> You don't like it here? (engine humming)
370,00:25:14.80,00:25:14.80,">> Hey, you guys, Patrick's got to go."
371,00:25:18.40,00:25:18.40,>> Stop that. >> I know.
372,00:25:20.87,00:25:20.87,">> Come on, now. >> I'm fine."
373,00:25:23.50,00:25:23.50,>> It's okay to cry. >> It's just weird that you came
374,00:25:25.73,00:25:25.73,"and then you're going, it's just odd."
375,00:25:28.27,00:25:28.27,>> I love you being here. Thanks for taking care
376,00:25:31.07,00:25:31.07,of my mom. >> Yeah.
377,00:25:32.50,00:25:32.50,"It ain't over, man. >> Thanks so much for"
378,00:25:35.00,00:25:35.00,"everything. >> All right, buddy."
379,00:25:38.53,00:25:38.53,">> Hey, enjoyed meeting you. >> Nice meeting you, too, man."
380,00:25:41.33,00:25:41.33,>> I'll see you later. >> You're a great kid.
381,00:25:44.77,00:25:44.77,"Wonderful meeting you. Be blessed, okay?"
382,00:25:47.83,00:25:47.83,>> Thank you. >> All right.
383,00:25:49.67,00:25:49.67,>> Have a good time. (laughter)
384,00:25:52.77,00:25:52.77,">> Yeah, we'll have a ball. Anyway, thanks for coming."
385,00:25:57.87,00:25:57.87,>> It was awesome. >> Thanks for stopping by.
386,00:26:02.13,00:26:02.13,>> Nice taste of the life we left behind.
387,00:26:06.80,00:26:06.80,>> Of the life we're getting ready to see.
388,00:26:08.40,00:26:08.40,>> Mm-hmm. >> Stop it.
389,00:26:12.67,00:26:12.67,">> Okay. >> Go back, have fun."
390,00:26:17.13,00:26:17.13,">> I know, I'll be fine. I don't know why I'm crying."
391,00:26:19.17,00:26:19.17,>> Be yourself. >> I know.
392,00:26:24.60,00:26:24.60,>> Bye. You look so good! Can you hear me?
393,00:26:28.97,00:26:28.97,>> Yeah. You look really good.
394,00:26:30.93,00:26:30.93,">> You do, too! >> (laughing) Yeah..."
395,00:26:34.20,00:26:34.20,">> Peace, baby, I love you. I don't want to get depressed"
396,00:26:51.60,00:26:51.60,out here. So I just use his strength to
397,00:26:54.63,00:26:54.63,"come back, and come back to this game and just finish it out."
398,00:26:58.97,00:26:58.97,"You know, finish what you start, that's always been my motto to"
399,00:27:01.40,00:27:01.40,"him, so that's my motto to myself, even though it's feeling"
400,00:27:04.57,00:27:04.57,"very peculiar out here, it's stupid."
401,00:27:08.60,00:27:08.60,"He gave me a lot of strength, but it's hard to see him go."
402,00:27:10.97,00:27:10.97,"It's crazy, and he kept saying, ""How crazy this is, Mom."""
403,00:27:16.77,00:27:16.77,"I said, ""Yeah, it is crazy."" But I'll finish it."
404,00:27:26.17,00:27:26.17,">> Yeah, Sean and V are a little pissy."
405,00:27:29.80,00:27:29.80,>> Are they? >> Yeah.
406,00:27:31.87,00:27:31.87,>> At each other? >> No.
407,00:27:33.33,00:27:33.33,>> At us? >> No.
408,00:27:36.07,00:27:36.07,Neleh. >> When did you see that?
409,00:27:37.80,00:27:37.80,">> Well, Sean said something yesterday."
410,00:27:39.60,00:27:39.60,"And V said to me today, she goes, ""You definitely deserve to"
411,00:27:42.20,00:27:42.20,"be here longer."" I'm feeling vulnerable because"
412,00:27:45.27,00:27:45.27,"it seems like if you look at the way it's going, each member of"
413,00:27:48.80,00:27:48.80,"the jury was part of old alliance, you know?"
414,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,And it seems like they're being picked off one by one and I'm
415,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,the last one left. But this game has so many
416,00:27:58.73,00:27:58.73,"twists, turns, just when you think you know what's going on,"
417,00:28:01.73,00:28:01.73,you have no idea what's going on.
418,00:28:04.23,00:28:04.23,>> Do you think Paschal and Neleh will be in the final two?
419,00:28:06.63,00:28:06.63,">> No, I think... >> Doesn't it feel that way?"
420,00:28:10.53,00:28:10.53,>> I think that's the way it's planning out.
421,00:28:13.30,00:28:13.30,>> I know. >> Do you think there's a way to
422,00:28:15.43,00:28:15.43,change it? >> Everything about yesterday
423,00:28:22.30,00:28:22.30,"was so amazing, though, seriously."
424,00:28:25.77,00:28:25.77,Just being able to see our family.
425,00:28:28.63,00:28:28.63,My mom was so happy. I'll never forget that look on
426,00:28:31.33,00:28:31.33,"her face for as long as I live. >> ""I am so happy to be here, my"
427,00:28:35.47,00:28:35.47,"mom came, and I am so happy that I saw..."""
428,00:28:39.63,00:28:39.63,"You know, I didn't even get to see my mother."
429,00:28:43.03,00:28:43.03,Basically V and I feel like Neleh is riding on Pappy's
430,00:28:49.23,00:28:49.23,coattails. I feel like she's been playing
431,00:28:52.00,00:28:52.00,"the girl next-door role, way, way to the next level."
432,00:28:55.80,00:28:55.80,"""You guys, this is so fantastic that we're here."
433,00:29:00.33,00:29:00.33,"You know, guys, I just love it when we just sit out here."
434,00:29:04.20,00:29:04.20,"You know, guys, I'm always feeling like I'm in Disneyland."""
435,00:29:07.90,00:29:07.90,">> Nobody, not even Paschal is going to be offended if we play"
436,00:29:10.97,00:29:10.97,"the game and knock him out, nobody."
437,00:29:13.73,00:29:13.73,>> I know. I don't want to vote for him
438,00:29:16.10,00:29:16.10,either... >> But I couldn't vote for him
439,00:29:18.20,00:29:18.20,over Neleh. >> Yeah.
440,00:29:20.47,00:29:20.47,">> I couldn't see, I couldn't vote for him over Sean either."
441,00:29:24.20,00:29:24.20,">> But I've got to tell you, Paschal is our strongest"
442,00:29:25.90,00:29:25.90,"adversary. >> You know, we're within a week"
443,00:29:29.43,00:29:29.43,"now, so... >> It definitely gave me the"
444,00:29:32.43,00:29:32.43,strength I need to finish this thing out.
445,00:29:35.67,00:29:35.67,"There's no way in the whole wide world I would ever give up now,"
446,00:29:39.10,00:29:39.10,"Paschal, ever. No way."
447,00:29:42.73,00:29:42.73,">> You know, cute little Mormon girl."
448,00:29:44.50,00:29:44.50,"Sweet little Mormon girl, ain't got jack to do with this game."
449,00:29:49.77,00:29:49.77,>> If we truly are going to go all out fighting to the end...
450,00:29:53.87,00:29:53.87,>> Mm-hmm. >> ...she got to go.
451,00:29:56.13,00:29:56.13,>> Neleh talks about it a lot. >> Does she really?
452,00:29:58.77,00:29:58.77,">> Oh, yeah, she talks about it all the time."
453,00:30:00.63,00:30:00.63,>> She plays more than I think she does sometimes.
454,00:30:02.37,00:30:02.37,">> Oh, yeah. >> Woo!"
455,00:30:05.93,00:30:05.93,I love it! Woo!
456,00:30:09.37,00:30:09.37,>> There she go with the BS. I hear her loud mouth already.
457,00:30:14.07,00:30:14.07,Disneyland. >> Woo!
458,00:30:24.30,00:30:24.30,">> If I end up in a final three with Paschal and Neleh, they've"
459,00:30:27.57,00:30:27.57,"got such a tight bond, they would vote me out."
460,00:30:30.20,00:30:30.20,"My other issue is if I'm in the final three with V. and Sean,"
461,00:30:34.87,00:30:34.87,definitely they're going to bond and vote me off.
462,00:30:37.80,00:30:37.80,"So theoretically, strategically, I should do this, and Rob and I"
463,00:30:43.17,00:30:43.17,should become a unit. >> Anything can happen in this
464,00:30:48.30,00:30:48.30,"game. After yesterday, you could"
465,00:30:50.10,00:30:50.10,"definitely see, you know, after reward challenge-- seeing where"
466,00:30:53.00,00:30:53.00,everybody saw their family-- this game takes you through
467,00:30:55.90,00:30:55.90,"every mental, emotional and physical high and low there is."
468,00:30:58.73,00:30:58.73,"So, you know, anything can happen."
469,00:31:14.10,00:31:14.10,">> PROBST: Come on in, guys. First things first."
470,00:31:19.00,00:31:19.00,Hate to do it. Got to take the immunity
471,00:31:20.77,00:31:20.77,necklace back. Thank you.
472,00:31:26.53,00:31:26.53,"Once again, immunity, back up for grabs."
473,00:31:28.93,00:31:28.93,Today's immunity challenge will test your proficiency with a
474,00:31:32.13,00:31:32.13,slingshot. Each of you have a color-coded
475,00:31:34.97,00:31:34.97,hourglass structure filled with sand.
476,00:31:38.07,00:31:38.07,At the base of the structure is a tiki.
477,00:31:40.77,00:31:40.77,"On my command, you will each fire one rock at another tribe"
478,00:31:42.67,00:31:42.67,"member's structure. Each time you hit a tile, you"
479,00:31:46.33,00:31:46.33,"release sand, the sand begins to cover the tiki."
480,00:31:49.87,00:31:49.87,"Once a person's tiki is completely covered, they're out"
481,00:31:52.73,00:31:52.73,"of the game. To keep things fair, after each"
482,00:31:55.27,00:31:55.27,"shot, you'll rotate one space over."
483,00:31:58.83,00:31:58.83,Last person left standing wins immunity.
484,00:32:01.43,00:32:01.43,Everybody square? Grab your rocks.
485,00:32:04.97,00:32:04.97,"All right, guys, everybody ready."
486,00:32:07.30,00:32:07.30,Take your aim. Fire!
487,00:32:10.93,00:32:10.93,"Sean took a little hit. The first hit, Robert."
488,00:32:16.67,00:32:16.67,"That will do a little damage, but that's not going to cover"
489,00:32:18.40,00:32:18.40,it. Everybody rotate one.
490,00:32:21.17,00:32:21.17,"To your right. Kathy, you go down to the end."
491,00:32:24.03,00:32:24.03,"Ready, aim, fire! >> Yeah."
492,00:32:30.20,00:32:30.20,">> Whoa! >> Good one, Rob."
493,00:32:32.13,00:32:32.13,">> General, nice shot, that may do it."
494,00:32:34.83,00:32:34.83,"Paschal, you're out of the game.  Survivors ready!"
495,00:32:39.23,00:32:39.23,"Aim, fire! V took a little bit of a hit."
496,00:32:44.90,00:32:44.90,"Big hit on Sean. >> Oh, damn!"
497,00:32:48.17,00:32:48.17,">> You're getting buried, bud! >> PROBST: Sean, that's it,"
498,00:32:51.33,00:32:51.33,"you're out of the game. >> The women rule this place,"
499,00:32:55.07,00:32:55.07,let's do this. >> Chicks!
500,00:32:58.00,00:32:58.00,">> PROBST: Survivors ready, aim, fire."
501,00:33:01.63,00:33:01.63,"V. hits the General. Very close, General."
502,00:33:05.67,00:33:05.67,"That's it, General, you're out. The guys have been eliminated."
503,00:33:09.60,00:33:09.60,"We're down to Neleh, V, Kathy. >> The chicks are in the final."
504,00:33:16.20,00:33:16.20,>> Do the chick dance. Get serious.
505,00:33:26.20,00:33:26.20,">> PROBST: Ready, aim, fire! Another hit on Vecepia, top left"
506,00:33:30.37,00:33:30.37,"by Kathy. Neleh, misses her shot at V."
507,00:33:35.07,00:33:35.07,Vecepia big hit on Neleh. Neither one covered the tiki.
508,00:33:38.97,00:33:38.97,"Ready, aim, fire! Neleh and V both connect on"
509,00:33:45.90,00:33:45.90,"Kathy. >> You buried me big, thanks a"
510,00:33:48.67,00:33:48.67,lot. >> PROBST: Your tiki is complete
511,00:33:50.67,00:33:50.67,"covered. Neleh, nice hit."
512,00:33:52.83,00:33:52.83,"Kathy, you're out of the game. This is it, we're down to two."
513,00:33:56.27,00:33:56.27,V at Neleh. Neleh looking for V.
514,00:33:59.43,00:33:59.43," Survivors ready. Aim, fire."
515,00:34:03.47,00:34:03.47,">> Woo! >> V connects with Neleh, but"
516,00:34:07.13,00:34:07.13,no sand up in the top of the structure.
517,00:34:09.63,00:34:09.63,">> Going to be a close one. >> Oh, yeah."
518,00:34:11.23,00:34:11.23,">> PROBST: The wind is helping you out, V."
519,00:34:13.43,00:34:13.43,"One good hit by either one of you, will put the other one out."
520,00:34:16.37,00:34:16.37," Survivors ready, aim, fire. >> Dang."
521,00:34:21.33,00:34:21.33,>> Everybody rotate. Neleh has got the best shot she
522,00:34:24.53,00:34:24.53,could hope for right now. V.'s got the best shot she could
523,00:34:27.43,00:34:27.43,hope for. You guys are both lined up in
524,00:34:29.67,00:34:29.67,"front of each others.  Survivors ready, aim, fire."
525,00:34:36.17,00:34:36.17,"Two big misses.  Survivors ready, aim, fire."
526,00:34:44.07,00:34:44.07,V. got a little hit on Neleh. >> Gosh!
527,00:34:46.47,00:34:46.47,">> Oh, yeah! Woo!"
528,00:34:50.20,00:34:50.20,">> PROBST: Neleh, you're out. V wins immunity."

531,00:34:58.57,00:34:58.57,Yeah! Woo!
532,00:35:03.27,00:35:03.27,Yeah! Yeah!
533,00:35:05.73,00:35:05.73,"Thank you! Thank you, Jesus! Yes!"

535,00:35:10.73,00:35:10.73,>> Woo! >> I am feeling vulnerable
536,00:35:34.67,00:35:34.67,"because of the past alliance that I had made, and if it comes"
537,00:35:38.23,00:35:38.23,"back to bite me, it comes back to bite me."
538,00:35:42.47,00:35:42.47,I will not change my fate by pleading or begging or talking
539,00:35:44.43,00:35:44.43,to anybody. If they have a mind-set that I'm
540,00:35:48.67,00:35:48.67,"the next one to vote out, then so be it."
541,00:35:55.43,00:35:55.43,"I came here with four things, and that was pride, dignity and"
542,00:35:58.83,00:35:58.83,integrity and a knapsack. And the only thing that's
543,00:36:01.63,00:36:01.63,tattered right now is that knapsack.
544,00:36:03.20,00:36:03.20,Everything else is intact. Plus an added extra bonus of the
545,00:36:06.37,00:36:06.37,relationships or friendships that I have made here.
546,00:36:10.30,00:36:10.30,">> I love you, babe. >> I love you, too."
547,00:36:13.43,00:36:13.43,>> Things have changed. My motivation and direction has
548,00:36:15.97,00:36:15.97,changed. Rob voted against us.
549,00:36:20.73,00:36:20.73,"When he had the alliance with Tammy and John, we were on the"
550,00:36:22.70,00:36:22.70,chopping block. So it's now Rob's turn to get
551,00:36:26.77,00:36:26.77,"chopped. But Paschal and Neleh, they need"
552,00:36:29.87,00:36:29.87,"to be severed. That unit needs to be severed,"
553,00:36:33.30,00:36:33.30,"because they're acting as a twosome, and I was the odd man"
554,00:36:35.87,00:36:35.87,"out, and Paschal and Neleh will totally understand that."
555,00:36:43.13,00:36:43.13,>> I could be the next one going out tonight if V and Sean and
556,00:36:46.00,00:36:46.00,Rob and Kathy decided to join a four alliance together and boot
557,00:36:50.70,00:36:50.70,"me and Paschal out. I mean, there's still a lot of"
558,00:36:53.53,00:36:53.53,"ways the game could twist, you never know what's going to"
559,00:36:56.33,00:36:56.33,happen. >> PROBST: I'll now bring in our
560,00:37:12.07,00:37:12.07,"jury. John, Zoe and Tammy, who you"
561,00:37:19.07,00:37:19.07,"voted out last week, they'll be eavesdropping tonight, gathering"
562,00:37:22.70,00:37:22.70,"information, ultimately that will help them decide which one"
563,00:37:26.43,00:37:26.43,of you will be the last one standing.
564,00:37:28.57,00:37:28.57,Let's talk about gamesmanship now.
565,00:37:30.83,00:37:30.83,"Kathy, tell me about your own discovery, as you got into this"
566,00:37:33.90,00:37:33.90,"game, the realization that, wow, everybody is playing,"
567,00:37:37.80,00:37:37.80,"we all just play differently, and how does that alter how you"
568,00:37:40.63,00:37:40.63,look at everyone? >> I definitely came into the
569,00:37:43.60,00:37:43.60,game thinking that I was going to be able to summarize
570,00:37:45.90,00:37:45.90,everybody's motives much sooner. And I would say 80% of the
571,00:37:50.30,00:37:50.30,people had a mask on. So I could not read it.
572,00:37:54.57,00:37:54.57,>> PROBST: Are the masks off now?
573,00:37:56.03,00:37:56.03,">> No, I don't think so, no. The masks are not totally off."
574,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,">> PROBST: V, would you agree with that, has everybody played"
575,00:38:01.00,00:38:01.00,their cards yet? >> I wouldn't say that everybody
576,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,has played their cards just yet. I believe that there may be some
577,00:38:07.20,00:38:07.20,people that started the game late and are enjoying the ride
578,00:38:09.97,00:38:09.97,"now, and maybe are waiting to the last hurrah to really throw"
579,00:38:13.03,00:38:13.03,in their trump card. You just try to expect the
580,00:38:17.10,00:38:17.10,unexpected and go for what you know.
581,00:38:20.00,00:38:20.00,">> PROBST: General, what was your first impression of V?"
582,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,>> First impression was a very nice lady.
583,00:38:25.30,00:38:25.30,"We didn't really talk much, but just seemed very nice, quiet,"
584,00:38:29.63,00:38:29.63,easygoing. >> PROBST: How would you
585,00:38:31.17,00:38:31.17,"describe V today? >> A player, definitely a"
586,00:38:33.40,00:38:33.40,player. Stronger than I thought.
587,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,"Definitely deceptive. >> PROBST: Sean, anybody here"
588,00:38:39.53,00:38:39.53,you underestimated now that you're 33 days in.
589,00:38:42.40,00:38:42.40,"You think, wow, never expected that?"
590,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,">> Definitely Neleh. Out of anybody up here, she's"
591,00:38:47.00,00:38:47.00,"definitely playing the game if you were to watch, and I don't"
592,00:38:49.80,00:38:49.80,"mean that negatively, I mean that kind of as a complement or"
593,00:38:52.90,00:38:52.90,"however else she's going to take it, but she's not the girl next-"
594,00:38:55.33,00:38:55.33,door. Although upon looking at her you
595,00:38:57.80,00:38:57.80,may think that because she's very sweet.
596,00:38:59.90,00:38:59.90,">> PROBST: Paschal, you've been pretty clear and honest that you"
597,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,"and Neleh sort of have had a bond, like a father-daughter"
598,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,bond from the beginning. How would you assess her as a
599,00:39:09.00,00:39:09.00,"player in the game? >> She's 21 years old, but I"
600,00:39:11.93,00:39:11.93,"promise you, she's got as much intelligence and cunning as"
601,00:39:15.60,00:39:15.60,anybody sitting up here or sitting on the jury.
602,00:39:19.13,00:39:19.13,"You don't deceive this young girl, and if you do, you only do"
603,00:39:22.80,00:39:22.80,"it one time. >> PROBST: Neleh, couple of"
604,00:39:25.53,00:39:25.53,"people very surprised as they I've gotten to know you, more of"
605,00:39:28.53,00:39:28.53,a player than they expected. What's your own assessment of
606,00:39:30.63,00:39:30.63,"yourself? >> You know, I just think I kind"
607,00:39:33.23,00:39:33.23,"of fell through the cracks. You know, definitely"
608,00:39:34.90,00:39:34.90,underestimated. I wasn't seen as a threat
609,00:39:37.10,00:39:37.10,because I wasn't the most outspoken person.
610,00:39:39.47,00:39:39.47,"So I realized that I wasn't going to make it past, you know,"
611,00:39:43.27,00:39:43.27,number six if I didn't speak up and tell people how I felt.
612,00:39:47.13,00:39:47.13,But I want to make it to the end.
613,00:39:49.90,00:39:49.90,">> PROBST: Vecepia, nice job today winning immunity."
614,00:39:52.73,00:39:52.73,">> Oh, it felt good. >> PROBST: One of the new rules,"
615,00:39:55.77,00:39:55.77,you can give that immunity up if you like.
616,00:39:58.40,00:39:58.40,">> Well, since this is the first time that I've won it, it feels"
617,00:40:00.53,00:40:00.53,very good on. So this baby is going to stay
618,00:40:04.83,00:40:04.83,"with me tonight, and we'll see what happens in three days."
619,00:40:08.70,00:40:08.70,">> PROBST: It is time to vote. Paschal, you're first."
620,00:40:53.37,00:40:53.37,"I'll go tally the votes. Once the votes are read, the"
621,00:41:08.00,00:41:08.00,decision is final. The person will be asked to
622,00:41:10.20,00:41:10.20,leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
623,00:41:11.93,00:41:11.93,"I'll read the votes. First vote, General."
624,00:41:23.73,00:41:23.73,"Sean. Rob, General."
625,00:41:33.20,00:41:33.20,"Two votes General, one vote Sean."
626,00:41:41.10,00:41:41.10,That's three votes. The 11th person voted out of the
627,00:41:50.67,00:41:50.67,"tribe, the General. You need to bring me your torch."
628,00:42:02.87,00:42:02.87,"General, the tribe has spoken. I know it's been a long,"
629,00:42:21.73,00:42:21.73,emotional couple of days. Keep your head in this.
630,00:42:25.20,00:42:25.20,You've made it down to five. It's anybody's game.
631,00:42:27.97,00:42:27.97,You can head back to camp. I'll see you tomorrow.
632,00:42:40.50,00:42:40.50,Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
633,00:42:46.63,00:42:46.63,>> PROBST: Next time on  Survivor: With the alliance of
634,00:42:48.70,00:42:48.70,four now completely gone... >> I thought Rob was my only
635,00:42:50.60,00:42:50.60,"out, but I had to stick with the majority, so I took out Rob."
636,00:42:53.57,00:42:53.57,>> PROBST: ...new battle lines are drawn.
637,00:42:56.37,00:42:56.37,">> I feel that Sean and V have a very, very tight bond."
638,00:42:58.80,00:42:58.80,>> Don't use me and V as a scapegoat.
639,00:43:01.27,00:43:01.27,"Because V And I are African- Americans, does that mean we're"
640,00:43:03.13,00:43:03.13,"an automatic alliance, no. >> I always say knowledge is"
641,00:43:12.30,00:43:12.30,power and all the knowledge that I accumulated in every
642,00:43:14.60,00:43:14.60,"conversation I had, every event I took part in, is knowledge"
643,00:43:18.23,00:43:18.23,that I will take from Tribal Council over to the jury and
644,00:43:20.80,00:43:20.80,judge the people who have judged me tonight.
645,00:43:23.53,00:43:23.53,"So remember, the day of reckoning comes for all."
646,00:43:26.23,00:43:26.23,"Give me about six weeks and I'm ready to do this all over again,"
647,00:43:28.63,00:43:28.63,"and that's about it, that's all I got to say."
