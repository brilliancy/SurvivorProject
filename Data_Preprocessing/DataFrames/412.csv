294,00:20:49.77,00:20:49.77,home are really more acute thanever.
295,00:20:53.17,00:20:53.17,It's really a wonderfulopportunity that I've had to
296,00:20:55.20,00:20:55.20,"come out here and, you know, I'm57 years old and for the first"
297,00:20:58.47,00:20:58.47,"time in my life, I have comeface-to-face with myself."
298,00:21:02.17,00:21:02.17,"And, um...some of the things I've seen"

302,00:21:14.90,00:21:14.90,determined when I go back homethat a lot of that is going to
303,00:21:18.23,00:21:18.23,change.We're the most blessed nation in
304,00:21:22.00,00:21:22.00,the world.We just take so much
305,00:21:24.50,00:21:24.50,"for granted, and it takes anexperience like this to realize"
306,00:21:26.53,00:21:26.53,"what you can really do without,and what really is important in"
307,00:21:30.30,00:21:30.30,your life.And it's not a fancy car and
308,00:21:32.37,00:21:32.37,it's not the number of TVs youhave and it's not your bank
309,00:21:34.83,00:21:34.83,account and it's not the clothesyou wear.
310,00:21:36.97,00:21:36.97,"It's, it's the people in yourlife."
311,00:21:41.83,00:21:41.83,">> Being out here, I've reallylearned not to take the small"
312,00:21:44.07,00:21:44.07,"things of life for granted.I mean, there are so many times"
313,00:21:49.43,00:21:49.43,where you buy a loaf of breadand you got three little pieces
314,00:21:51.77,00:21:51.77,"and the ends left, ""Oh, we don'tneed these"" and toss them in the"
315,00:21:55.77,00:21:55.77,garbage can.To be out here knowing that we
316,00:21:58.60,00:21:58.60,are scraping the last bit offood out of a coconut husk makes
317,00:22:03.83,00:22:03.83,me realize that going home Ineed to think twice about what
318,00:22:06.77,00:22:06.77,I'm doing.>> I need your help.
319,00:22:13.73,00:22:13.73,What I need help on is the game.And I have to tell you
320,00:22:15.97,00:22:15.97,something.I respect how you play games.
321,00:22:19.87,00:22:19.87,"So here I am, I have thisloyalty to Paschal and Neleh."
322,00:22:23.20,00:22:23.20,"Well, Paschal and Neleh are likefather and daughter, you've seen"
323,00:22:24.90,00:22:24.90,them together.>> Yeah.
324,00:22:26.17,00:22:26.17,>> You can feel it.So if we get down to the final
325,00:22:27.93,00:22:27.93,"three, Pascal and Neleh arevoting me off."
326,00:22:30.47,00:22:30.47,Unless I get immunity.So how do I get in the game?
327,00:22:34.90,00:22:34.90,Because they're going to bootme.
328,00:22:36.77,00:22:36.77,So the way to get back in thegame is sort of right now...
329,00:22:38.90,00:22:38.90,>> Vote with Sean and V.>> But if I end up in the final
330,00:22:41.17,00:22:41.17,"three with Sean and V, they'llvote me out."
331,00:22:44.17,00:22:44.17,"So the key player here is Rob, Ihave to make a decision to go to"
332,00:22:47.63,00:22:47.63,"Rob, V. and Sean.Do I go to those three people"
333,00:22:52.87,00:22:52.87,and form an alliance of fouragainst Paschal and Neleh and
334,00:22:56.27,00:22:56.27,look like a total...>> Bitch.
335,00:22:58.33,00:22:58.33,>> ...bitch.Help me.
336,00:23:03.03,00:23:03.03,>> You've got to hope that Robgets immunity.
337,00:23:06.03,00:23:06.03,"That's about it.>> No, I'm saying I could form"
338,00:23:07.80,00:23:07.80,"the alliance today, before thechallenge."
339,00:23:12.00,00:23:12.00,All of this is seductive andcunning and it's not like me.
340,00:23:16.93,00:23:16.93,">> Yes, I don't like this sideof you."
341,00:23:19.67,00:23:19.67,>> But that's what the game doesto you.
342,00:23:21.27,00:23:21.27,">> I know.>> All of a sudden, I'm just"
343,00:23:22.83,00:23:22.83,trying to play the game.So what do I do?
344,00:23:24.30,00:23:24.30,">> I don't know, I never playeda game like this before."
345,00:23:26.70,00:23:26.70,">> You got to help me though.I got my family here, my most"
346,00:23:28.77,00:23:28.77,trusted ally.>> It's messed up-- the
347,00:23:31.77,00:23:31.77,situation they put you in.>> It is messed up.
348,00:23:34.77,00:23:34.77,"If I won the million bucks now,if I were to form this"
349,00:23:36.73,00:23:36.73,"alliance of four...?Patrick, I'm so proud of you."

413,00:27:51.97,00:27:51.97,And it seems like they're beingpicked off one by one and I'm
414,00:27:55.33,00:27:55.33,the last one left.But this game has so many
415,00:27:58.73,00:27:58.73,"twists, turns, just when youthink you know what's going on,"

564,00:37:30.83,00:37:30.83,"Kathy, tell me about your owndiscovery, as you got into this"
565,00:37:33.90,00:37:33.90,"game, the realization that, wow,everybody is playing,"
566,00:37:37.80,00:37:37.80,"we all just play differently,and how does that alter how you"
567,00:37:40.63,00:37:40.63,look at everyone?>> I definitely came into the
568,00:37:43.60,00:37:43.60,game thinking that I was goingto be able to summarize
569,00:37:45.90,00:37:45.90,everybody's motives much sooner.And I would say 80% of the
570,00:37:50.30,00:37:50.30,people had a mask on.So I could not read it.
571,00:37:54.57,00:37:54.57,>> PROBST: Are the masks offnow?
572,00:37:56.03,00:37:56.03,">> No, I don't think so, no.The masks are not totally off."
573,00:37:58.87,00:37:58.87,">> PROBST: V, would you agreewith that, has everybody played"
574,00:38:01.00,00:38:01.00,their cards yet?>> I wouldn't say that everybody
575,00:38:04.37,00:38:04.37,has played their cards just yet.I believe that there may be some
576,00:38:07.20,00:38:07.20,people that started the gamelate and are enjoying the ride
577,00:38:09.97,00:38:09.97,"now, and maybe are waiting tothe last hurrah to really throw"
578,00:38:13.03,00:38:13.03,in their trump card.You just try to expect the
579,00:38:17.10,00:38:17.10,unexpected and go for what youknow.
580,00:38:20.00,00:38:20.00,">> PROBST: General, what wasyour first impression of V?"
581,00:38:22.37,00:38:22.37,>> First impression was a verynice lady.
582,00:38:25.30,00:38:25.30,"We didn't really talk much, butjust seemed very nice, quiet,"
583,00:38:29.63,00:38:29.63,easygoing.>> PROBST: How would you
584,00:38:31.17,00:38:31.17,"describe V today?>> A player, definitely a"
585,00:38:33.40,00:38:33.40,player.Stronger than I thought.
586,00:38:36.83,00:38:36.83,"Definitely deceptive.>> PROBST: Sean, anybody here"
587,00:38:39.53,00:38:39.53,you underestimated now thatyou're 33 days in.
588,00:38:42.40,00:38:42.40,"You think, wow, never expectedthat?"
589,00:38:44.50,00:38:44.50,">> Definitely Neleh.Out of anybody up here, she's"
590,00:38:47.00,00:38:47.00,"definitely playing the game ifyou were to watch, and I don't"
591,00:38:49.80,00:38:49.80,"mean that negatively, I meanthat kind of as a complement or"
592,00:38:52.90,00:38:52.90,"however else she's going to takeit, but she's not the girl next-"
593,00:38:55.33,00:38:55.33,door.Although upon looking at her you
594,00:38:57.80,00:38:57.80,may think that because she'svery sweet.
595,00:38:59.90,00:38:59.90,">> PROBST: Paschal, you've beenpretty clear and honest that you"
596,00:39:02.97,00:39:02.97,"and Neleh sort of have had abond, like a father-daughter"
597,00:39:06.17,00:39:06.17,bond from the beginning.How would you assess her as a
598,00:39:09.00,00:39:09.00,"player in the game?>> She's 21 years old, but I"
599,00:39:11.93,00:39:11.93,"promise you, she's got as muchintelligence and cunning as"
600,00:39:15.60,00:39:15.60,anybody sitting up here orsitting on the jury.
601,00:39:19.13,00:39:19.13,"You don't deceive this younggirl, and if you do, you only do"
602,00:39:22.80,00:39:22.80,"it one time.>> PROBST: Neleh, couple of"
603,00:39:25.53,00:39:25.53,"people very surprised as theyI've gotten to know you, more of"
604,00:39:28.53,00:39:28.53,a player than they expected.What's your own assessment of
605,00:39:30.63,00:39:30.63,"yourself?>> You know, I just think I kind"
606,00:39:33.23,00:39:33.23,"of fell through the cracks.You know, definitely"
607,00:39:34.90,00:39:34.90,underestimated.I wasn't seen as a threat
608,00:39:37.10,00:39:37.10,because I wasn't the mostoutspoken person.
609,00:39:39.47,00:39:39.47,"So I realized that I wasn'tgoing to make it past, you know,"
610,00:39:43.27,00:39:43.27,number six if I didn't speak upand tell people how I felt.
611,00:39:47.13,00:39:47.13,But I want to make it to theend.
612,00:39:49.90,00:39:49.90,">> PROBST: Vecepia, nice jobtoday winning immunity."
613,00:39:52.73,00:39:52.73,">> Oh, it felt good.>> PROBST: One of the new rules,"
614,00:39:55.77,00:39:55.77,you can give that immunity up ifyou like.
615,00:39:58.40,00:39:58.40,">> Well, since this is the firsttime that I've won it, it feels"
616,00:40:00.53,00:40:00.53,very good on.So this baby is going to stay
617,00:40:04.83,00:40:04.83,"with me tonight, and we'll seewhat happens in three days."
618,00:40:08.70,00:40:08.70,">> PROBST: It is time to vote.Paschal, you're first."
619,00:40:53.37,00:40:53.37,"I'll go tally the votes.Once the votes are read, the"
620,00:41:08.00,00:41:08.00,decision is final.The person will be asked to
621,00:41:10.20,00:41:10.20,leave the Tribal Council areaimmediately.
622,00:41:11.93,00:41:11.93,"I'll read the votes.First vote, General."
623,00:41:23.73,00:41:23.73,"Sean.Rob, General."
624,00:41:33.20,00:41:33.20,"Two votes General, one voteSean."
625,00:41:41.10,00:41:41.10,That's three votes.The 11th person voted out of the
626,00:41:50.67,00:41:50.67,"tribe, the General.You need to bring me your torch."
627,00:42:02.87,00:42:02.87,"General, the tribe has spoken.I know it's been a long,"
628,00:42:21.73,00:42:21.73,emotional couple of days.Keep your head in this.
629,00:42:25.20,00:42:25.20,You've made it down to five.It's anybody's game.
630,00:42:27.97,00:42:27.97,You can head back to camp.I'll see you tomorrow.
631,00:42:40.50,00:42:40.50,Stay tuned for scenes from ournext episode.

634,00:42:50.60,00:42:50.60,"out, but I had to stick with themajority, so I took out Rob."
635,00:42:53.57,00:42:53.57,>> PROBST: ...new battle linesare drawn.
636,00:42:56.37,00:42:56.37,">> I feel that Sean and Vhave a very, very tight bond."
637,00:42:58.80,00:42:58.80,>> Don't use me and V as ascapegoat.
638,00:43:01.27,00:43:01.27,"Because V And I are African-Americans, does that mean we're"
639,00:43:03.13,00:43:03.13,"an automatic alliance, no.>> I always say knowledge is"
640,00:43:12.30,00:43:12.30,power and all the knowledge thatI accumulated in every
641,00:43:14.60,00:43:14.60,"conversation I had, every eventI took part in, is knowledge"
642,00:43:18.23,00:43:18.23,that I will take from TribalCouncil over to the jury and
643,00:43:20.80,00:43:20.80,judge the people who have judgedme tonight.
